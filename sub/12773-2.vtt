WEBVTT

00:04.086 --> 00:05.820
Yes.

00:07.222 --> 00:08.956
Hey.
(laughs)

00:11.026 --> 00:13.639
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.706
Kiss her.
You're married.

00:14.807 --> 00:17.709
(laughing, cheering)

00:17.810 --> 00:19.912
(whooping)

00:20.013 --> 00:21.313
Are you a doctor?

00:21.414 --> 00:22.814
I'm the EMT who brought you in.

00:22.916 --> 00:24.016
Kyle.
Nice to meet you.

00:24.117 --> 00:25.517
I'm Heather.
I know.

00:25.618 --> 00:26.852
I brought you in.

00:26.953 --> 00:28.921
Oh.
(both laughing)

00:29.022 --> 00:30.355
What's going on?
Oh, you know,

00:30.456 --> 00:32.323
just people
getting skinned alive,

00:32.424 --> 00:35.327
beast hunters.
Beast hunters?

00:35.428 --> 00:38.163
I don't know anything
about beasts.

00:38.264 --> 00:40.832
Seeing as someone's willing to
pay $5 million to capture one.

00:40.934 --> 00:42.701
There's a bounty?

00:42.802 --> 00:44.069
One mystery buyer
puts out a bounty.

00:44.170 --> 00:47.005
Yeah, but he was close.
He has no idea it's me.

00:47.106 --> 00:49.341
I guess our work's
not done yet.

00:49.442 --> 00:52.044
Will it ever be?

00:52.145 --> 00:54.580
♪

01:00.653 --> 01:03.021
Okay. Uh...

01:03.122 --> 01:05.691
Jogging a little fast here,
aren't we, Vincent?

01:05.792 --> 01:07.626
(panting)

01:07.727 --> 01:10.095
Not exactly newlywed
bonding time.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.965
Can we slow down
a little bit, Vincent?

01:13.066 --> 01:15.033
Vincent.

01:15.134 --> 01:16.668
Vincent, wait. Stop!

01:20.840 --> 01:22.007
(talking quietly, laughing)

01:30.316 --> 01:31.950
What are you thinking?

01:32.051 --> 01:33.285
Somebody could
have seen you.

01:33.386 --> 01:34.553
Yes, I know, okay?

01:34.654 --> 01:36.388
I just, I got distracted.

01:36.489 --> 01:38.824
By the bounty.
What happened?

01:38.925 --> 01:40.158
I thought you said you weren't
worried about that?

01:40.260 --> 01:42.261
Yeah, well, that was
until I slept on it.

01:42.362 --> 01:43.962
Or, more to the point,
that I didn't sleep.

01:44.063 --> 01:46.431
At all.

01:46.532 --> 01:49.768
Look, I know that we
have handled worse,

01:49.869 --> 01:51.188
and I know that we can
handle anything.

01:51.212 --> 01:52.212
But...?

01:53.239 --> 01:54.606
I don't know.

01:54.707 --> 01:57.743
I just, I guess I'm worried

01:57.844 --> 02:00.145
about dragging everybody
back into this whole,

02:00.246 --> 02:02.481
people chasing me
thing again.

02:02.582 --> 02:05.017
Okay, first of all,
whoever's behind this bounty

02:05.118 --> 02:06.285
doesn't know that
you're a beast yet,

02:06.386 --> 02:07.586
so we still have time.

02:07.687 --> 02:09.687
And, second...
I love you.

02:10.889 --> 02:12.170
And I know who and what you were

02:12.258 --> 02:13.925
when I married you.

02:14.027 --> 02:15.360
I know who I married, too,
and she's not the kind of girl

02:15.461 --> 02:17.029
who wants to keep
defining herself

02:17.130 --> 02:18.530
by protecting her husband
all the time.

02:18.631 --> 02:20.932
I'm not, and I won't.

02:21.034 --> 02:22.868
Look, last week
you saved me

02:22.969 --> 02:24.336
and you gave me
a pep talk,

02:24.437 --> 02:27.873
so it's my turn
to save and pep you.

02:27.974 --> 02:30.309
(laughs): We are going
to get through this,

02:30.410 --> 02:32.277
like you said,
and then we will move on.

02:32.378 --> 02:33.812
Have you heard from JT?

02:33.913 --> 02:35.847
Has he said anything
about getting any leads

02:35.948 --> 02:37.582
on who might be
after me this time?

02:41.154 --> 02:42.688
I'm not saying.

02:42.789 --> 02:44.222
What?

02:44.324 --> 02:45.991
Listen, I've been thinking
that maybe

02:46.092 --> 02:48.060
you should let me
take lead for a while.

02:48.161 --> 02:50.629
If anything comes up,
I will tell you, I promise,

02:50.730 --> 02:52.331
but we can't have you

02:52.432 --> 02:54.166
blurring around
the city all upset.

02:54.267 --> 02:56.401
Just go back to work,
be normal.

02:56.502 --> 02:58.236
So, what, you're benching me?

02:58.338 --> 03:01.640
Yes. Yes, I am. And,

03:01.741 --> 03:04.309
hopefully, with any luck,
JT has already found something.

03:04.410 --> 03:06.311
All right?
All right.

03:06.412 --> 03:09.314
Lead the way.
Huh.

03:09.415 --> 03:11.450
"Huh."

03:14.320 --> 03:15.987
I can't find anything.

03:16.089 --> 03:17.689
That's why you got
to label boxes.

03:17.790 --> 03:20.525
So when you're looking
for something, you can find it.

03:20.626 --> 03:22.728
Where's my other shoe?

03:22.829 --> 03:25.197
By the door.

03:25.298 --> 03:28.500
You would think I was entering a beauty
pageant instead of getting a new headshot

03:28.601 --> 03:31.536
for the precinct Web
site. Hey, this, uh...

03:31.637 --> 03:33.905
this blouse,
does it look too bossy?

03:35.441 --> 03:36.241
JT?

03:36.342 --> 03:37.542
Definitely hair down.

03:37.643 --> 03:39.277
Hair was three questions ago.

03:39.379 --> 03:42.547
Shouldn't you be
grading exams,

03:42.648 --> 03:45.951
finding out about
your tenure, packing?

03:46.052 --> 03:47.419
I guess I didn't realize
how many beast buyers

03:47.520 --> 03:48.420
could be out there.

03:48.521 --> 03:49.921
DHS gave Cat access

03:50.022 --> 03:52.591
to all their classified files--
arms dealers,

03:52.692 --> 03:54.559
drug lords,
terrorists. I mean,

03:54.660 --> 03:57.229
who wouldn't want a super
soldier in their back pocket?

03:57.330 --> 03:59.398
Exactly. Could take some time.

03:59.499 --> 04:01.400
All the more reason
to try to find

04:01.501 --> 04:03.435
a little balance in our lives,
right?

04:07.340 --> 04:11.143
Look, I honor what you said
about your whole need

04:11.244 --> 04:14.413
to be a part of something
bigger, to help, but...

04:14.514 --> 04:15.747
we matter, too, right?

04:15.848 --> 04:17.916
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean,

04:18.017 --> 04:20.428
we're supposed to be moving
into our new apartment together.

04:20.428 --> 04:24.455
I know. I want that, too,
more than anything. I do.

04:24.557 --> 04:27.292
But I can't just put this
on hold either.

04:27.393 --> 04:31.596
I mean, if we don't find out
who's got a bounty on Vincent...

04:31.697 --> 04:33.298
I know, I know. Never mind.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.767
Hey.

04:35.868 --> 04:37.769
I'm not just doing this
for Vincent.

04:37.870 --> 04:39.404
I'm doing this for us, too.

04:39.505 --> 04:42.073
'Cause the sooner
I can help figure out

04:42.175 --> 04:45.744
who's after him, the sooner
I can focus on packing.

04:45.845 --> 04:52.117
And I think the bossy blouse
is perfect, Captain.

04:52.218 --> 04:55.086
You didn't think
I was listening, did you?

04:55.188 --> 04:56.488
No. No, I didn't.

04:58.124 --> 05:00.625
(beeping)

05:00.726 --> 05:01.960
(trilling)

05:02.061 --> 05:04.996
What the hell?

05:06.365 --> 05:07.999
What's happening?

05:08.100 --> 05:11.603
I don't know.
I, uh... The files,

05:11.704 --> 05:13.939
they're being downloaded
to another computer.

05:14.040 --> 05:18.376
I think someone's hacking
into Homeland Security.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:27.887 --> 05:30.522
(knocking)
Yeah?

05:30.623 --> 05:31.990
Vincent, the nurse said
I could...

05:33.593 --> 05:34.593
Really?

05:34.627 --> 05:37.629
Pretty busy here.

05:37.730 --> 05:39.570
Wait, is Catherine okay?
Is something going on?

05:39.632 --> 05:41.333
What? Yeah, Catherine's fine,
I think.

05:41.434 --> 05:42.868
Why? Is there another bounty
hunter after you or something?

05:42.969 --> 05:44.503
Eh, how would I know?

05:45.972 --> 05:48.540
Don't ask.

05:48.641 --> 05:50.175
What's up?

05:50.276 --> 05:53.345
Oh, you know,
same ol', same ol'.

05:53.446 --> 05:54.646
Kyle's not in today.

05:54.747 --> 05:55.847
Who?

05:57.083 --> 05:58.383
Okay, fine, maybe I was hoping

05:58.484 --> 05:59.918
to bump into him, you know?
Yeah, well,

06:00.019 --> 06:01.186
it's probably better you don't,
all right?

06:01.287 --> 06:04.189
At least until Catherine...

06:04.290 --> 06:06.091
finds whoever's after me.

06:06.192 --> 06:07.392
How come you're not helping?

06:07.493 --> 06:09.394
Well, you know,
I'm an exposure risk,

06:09.495 --> 06:12.731
apparently, so I'm just trying
to lay low, stay calm.

06:12.832 --> 06:14.099
(growls)

06:14.200 --> 06:17.702
(clanging)

06:17.803 --> 06:19.704
(sighs)

06:19.805 --> 06:21.573
It's not easy.

06:21.674 --> 06:24.342
I can see that.
I hate this, you know?

06:24.443 --> 06:27.679
Especially when I'm the target.
It's so not fair on your sister.

06:27.780 --> 06:29.548
She's used to
it. No, I...

06:29.649 --> 06:32.284
I mean, she loves you. You know
she would do anything for you.

06:32.385 --> 06:34.052
I know. I know, but I don't want
her to have to do this

06:34.153 --> 06:36.454
all the time, you know?
I just want her to be able to do

06:36.556 --> 06:39.057
what she wants to do
with her own life.

06:39.158 --> 06:41.626
Yeah, well, for better
or for worse, right?

06:41.727 --> 06:43.528
Anyway,

06:43.629 --> 06:46.865
if you happen to run
into Kyle...

06:46.966 --> 06:48.286
Heather, you just met the guy.
So?

06:48.334 --> 06:50.936
I like him.
And he likes me, too.

06:51.037 --> 06:53.038
We've actually texted, like,
a billion times since...

06:53.139 --> 06:54.773
Since your one-night stand?

06:54.874 --> 06:56.775
I was gonna say,
"Since he rescued me."

06:56.876 --> 06:58.410
You don't like him, do you?

06:58.511 --> 06:59.144
No.

06:59.245 --> 07:00.378
What?

07:00.479 --> 07:01.780
No, no. Look, it's not that.

07:01.881 --> 07:04.716
It's just... I'm grumpy, okay?

07:04.817 --> 07:06.418
So please don't take this
the wrong way.

07:06.519 --> 07:07.652
But like your sister said,

07:07.753 --> 07:09.087
this really isn't a great time,

07:09.188 --> 07:10.789
exposure-wise,
to be bringing someone new

07:10.890 --> 07:12.424
into our inner circle.

07:12.525 --> 07:15.327
At least wait until we catch
the jerk who's after me.

07:15.428 --> 07:17.495
What about the next jerk
or the jerk after that?

07:17.597 --> 07:19.230
(sighs)
God, Vincent, I'm just saying,

07:19.332 --> 07:21.572
if I have to wait to have
a normal life until you guys...

07:23.002 --> 07:26.171
Sorry. Sore subject, I know.
(knocking)

07:26.272 --> 07:28.607
Doctor, severe
bowel blockage.

07:28.708 --> 07:32.010
Trauma Three.
If you'll excuse me, Heather,

07:32.111 --> 07:34.446
I have a bowel blockage
to attend to.

07:34.547 --> 07:36.848
All right.

07:36.949 --> 07:39.684
(door opens)

07:39.785 --> 07:41.953
(door shuts)
You enjoy that.

07:43.556 --> 07:45.824
CATHERINE:
<i>Vincent is busy saving lives.</i>

07:45.925 --> 07:48.582
I don't want to bother him
with this unless we have to.

07:48.583 --> 07:51.030
Well, we might not have a choice.
Somebody definitely hacked

07:51.130 --> 07:53.264
into DHS computers
and stole files,

07:53.366 --> 07:54.599
including the ones that are
supposed to keep his secret

07:54.700 --> 07:56.468
a secret.
Can we tell

07:56.569 --> 07:58.169
if that's what they were trying to do?
That's what

07:58.270 --> 08:00.305
I'm trying to find out.

08:02.375 --> 08:04.009
Who the hell is he?

08:04.110 --> 08:07.012
I'm, uh... I'm with her.

08:07.113 --> 08:10.181
This is Professor Forbes.
JT. He's a friend.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.683
Of Vincent's.
He knows.

08:11.784 --> 08:13.184
Ah, the computer nerd.

08:15.121 --> 08:17.022
I didn't say "nerd."

08:17.123 --> 08:19.791
This is Deputy Secretary
Hill. He's the man

08:19.892 --> 08:22.027
who's been covering for us.
Something that's getting harder

08:22.128 --> 08:25.130
and harder to do since Agent
Russo's murder. And now this.

08:25.231 --> 08:28.133
Other agents are already all
over this hack, investigating,

08:28.234 --> 08:31.369
which means you have to beat
the rest of DHS to the punch,

08:31.470 --> 08:33.804
especially if this turns out
to be about Vincent.

08:33.905 --> 08:35.740
Well, is it?

08:35.841 --> 08:38.243
(sighs)

08:39.912 --> 08:41.846
Sorry. I-I didn't know
you were finished.

08:41.947 --> 08:43.481
Um, I
don't know

08:43.582 --> 08:46.584
specifically what the hackers
were after yet,

08:46.686 --> 08:48.019
but I do know
that they targeted

08:48.120 --> 08:50.021
highly classified,
deep cover assets.

08:50.122 --> 08:52.023
And they definitely seem
to be looking

08:52.124 --> 08:53.725
for somebody in particular.
Yeah,

08:53.826 --> 08:55.160
but who?
I don't know yet, but good news

08:55.261 --> 08:57.162
is the files
are heavily encrypted,

08:57.263 --> 08:59.230
which buys us some time
to find out.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.833
I don't have time.
And neither do you.

09:01.934 --> 09:04.235
It's not just about you or
your husband's ass on the line

09:04.336 --> 09:06.504
anymore-- it's mine, too.
I went out on a limb

09:06.605 --> 09:07.906
to protect you people.

09:08.007 --> 09:09.874
Because we saved your ass
by bringing down

09:09.975 --> 09:13.278
one of DHS's most wanted, which
you couldn't do by yourself.

09:13.379 --> 09:15.046
Which is why I covered for you,
but that was under the condition

09:15.147 --> 09:16.614
it would not become a problem
for me.

09:16.716 --> 09:19.350
Do you have any idea
what would happen if the public

09:19.452 --> 09:21.753
found out
that DHS was protecting a beast?

09:21.854 --> 09:23.354
If I was?

09:23.456 --> 09:26.691
Okay, look, the chances
of this... hack

09:26.792 --> 09:29.260
being a coincidence on the heels
of somebody killing

09:29.361 --> 09:31.196
the only other agent
who knew about Vincent

09:31.297 --> 09:32.931
are... they're remote.

09:33.032 --> 09:35.200
So if you'll just
give me access...

09:35.301 --> 09:36.801
DHS cannot be involved.

09:36.902 --> 09:37.902
Excuse me?

09:37.970 --> 09:39.571
I can't risk it.

09:39.672 --> 09:41.592
You'll have to investigate
this hack on your own,

09:41.674 --> 09:43.241
and you'll have to do it
before the rest of DHS

09:43.342 --> 09:45.182
finds out what's going on.
What, so if anything

09:45.244 --> 09:47.445
goes wrong, you disavow
any knowledge of it?

09:50.382 --> 09:52.150
Look, I covered for you
because it was

09:52.251 --> 09:53.952
the right thing to do
at the time.

09:54.053 --> 09:56.755
But it is your job
to contain it.

09:56.856 --> 09:58.089
Do you understand?

10:05.831 --> 10:07.732
(door opens, closes)

10:07.833 --> 10:09.267
Now what?

10:15.441 --> 10:16.975
TESS:
How'd I get roped into all this?

10:17.076 --> 10:19.844
I feel like I'm sliding back
down the slippery slope.

10:19.945 --> 10:21.312
Translation, please?

10:21.413 --> 10:24.182
Uh, you know what I mean, okay?
The B word?

10:24.283 --> 10:26.918
First it was JT, now you.
I can't believe I'm being

10:27.019 --> 10:28.092
dragged back into all this.

10:28.116 --> 10:29.954
Well, don't say that
to Vincent when you see him.

10:29.955 --> 10:32.023
Dragging us back in
is what's freaking him out.

10:32.124 --> 10:33.792
Understandable.
Don't tell me

10:33.893 --> 10:35.593
you're not pissed about
having to move backwards.

10:35.694 --> 10:37.095
I can't be the only one

10:37.196 --> 10:39.030
who wants to move on
with my life, can I?

10:39.131 --> 10:40.698
No, of course not.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.267
I knew that getting
married wasn't a guarantee

10:42.368 --> 10:43.835
that all this
would suddenly go away.

10:43.936 --> 10:45.670
So we just...
we got to keep fighting

10:45.771 --> 10:46.971
until it's done, that's all.

10:47.072 --> 10:49.874
That'll be when, exactly?

10:49.975 --> 10:52.310
Hopefully whenever we figure out
who's behind this beast bounty.

10:52.411 --> 10:55.113
But DHS won't help?
No.

10:55.214 --> 10:56.714
Deputy secretary's
having buyer's remorse

10:56.816 --> 10:58.216
covering for us.

10:58.317 --> 11:00.318
Hey, get in line.
Hey.

11:00.419 --> 11:02.821
Helping me is the only
reason that you're not

11:02.922 --> 11:04.022
turning into a stuffy,
out-of-the-loop

11:04.123 --> 11:05.657
captain that we have
always hated.

11:05.758 --> 11:07.792
I get you back out on the
street, I get you back

11:07.893 --> 11:10.061
in the action. Admit
it, you miss this.

11:10.162 --> 11:11.963
No, I don't.

11:12.064 --> 11:13.698
All right, maybe a little bit,

11:13.799 --> 11:15.725
but, um, I don't miss
this kind of action.

11:15.726 --> 11:16.757
What are we even doing here?

11:16.781 --> 11:18.303
JT traced the hack to
the Durbrige Hotel,

11:18.304 --> 11:20.405
so, hopefully, we
will find the hacker,

11:20.506 --> 11:22.473
and then whoever's
after Vincent.

11:22.575 --> 11:24.509
It's never that easy,
especially with you two.

11:24.610 --> 11:26.377
More than likely,
this whole thing's gonna...

11:31.250 --> 11:33.484
...blow up in our faces.

11:33.586 --> 11:34.853
MAN:
Call 911!

11:50.417 --> 11:51.750
Come on, get back.
REPORTER: Is she okay?

11:51.851 --> 11:54.219
Do the police have a suspect?

11:54.320 --> 11:55.236
Didn't take long
for them to show up.

11:55.260 --> 11:56.221
That's what happens

11:56.222 --> 11:58.152
when you try to blow up a
spoiled celebutante.

11:58.153 --> 11:59.252
Bootsy Durbrige--
where'd they take her?

11:59.276 --> 12:00.392
Trauma Five.

12:00.393 --> 12:03.595
Thank you. With all the exposure
threats we have right now,

12:03.697 --> 12:05.764
paparazzi is the last thing
we need.

12:05.865 --> 12:07.566
Forensics figure out
how Bootsy survived the blast?

12:07.667 --> 12:09.601
Yeah. Controlled explosion,

12:09.703 --> 12:11.336
professionally designed
not to kill her.

12:11.438 --> 12:12.905
Wait, what do you mean?
Looks like somebody

12:13.006 --> 12:14.840
was just trying to scare
her for some reason.

12:14.941 --> 12:17.509
Like, warn her or something?
Hey, celebrity socialites

12:17.610 --> 12:20.179
piss people off all the time.
Me included.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.160
Trying to blow somebody up
is a little bit worse

12:22.248 --> 12:23.949
than just being pissed off.

12:24.050 --> 12:25.617
Maybe, but, hey,
at least you know...

12:25.719 --> 12:27.419
you know it doesn't have to do
with beasts or Vincent.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.787
No, we don't
know that for sure.

12:28.888 --> 12:31.156
Really?
What possible connection

12:31.257 --> 12:34.460
could Bootsy Durbrige
have with beast bounties?

12:34.561 --> 12:36.628
We know that whoever's
behind this hacked into DHS

12:36.730 --> 12:38.630
from one of her
father's hotels, right?

12:38.732 --> 12:41.500
Which means they're looking for
somebody and it can't be Bootsy,

12:41.601 --> 12:45.471
because, well, everybody knows
where Bootsy lives, obviously.

12:45.572 --> 12:47.706
So...
So maybe she figured out

12:47.807 --> 12:49.847
who the hacker was and they
wanted to scare her off.

12:49.876 --> 12:51.343
Either way, I need
to talk to her

12:51.444 --> 12:53.812
and figure out if it
<i>is</i> connected. And you...

12:53.913 --> 12:55.447
need to keep them
away from Vincent.

12:55.548 --> 12:57.783
No...
Yes.

12:57.884 --> 12:59.685
You know I got
a real job, right?

12:59.786 --> 13:01.220
Real life.

13:01.321 --> 13:02.988
Supposedly.

13:03.089 --> 13:04.890
(clamoring continues)

13:04.991 --> 13:06.711
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Any available security...

13:06.760 --> 13:09.161
Bootsy Durbrige?

13:09.262 --> 13:10.562
(sighs)

13:10.663 --> 13:11.964
Detective Chandler, NYPD.

13:12.065 --> 13:13.732
Hang on.

13:13.833 --> 13:15.501
(shutter clicks)

13:15.602 --> 13:17.536
Just texting my doggie
to make sure she knows I'm okay.

13:17.637 --> 13:19.071
Thank God
she was

13:19.172 --> 13:20.873
at the groomers
when it happened, right?

13:20.974 --> 13:22.074
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

13:22.175 --> 13:24.076
Actually, I do.

13:24.177 --> 13:27.346
I'm a little tired, somebody
just tried to blow me up.

13:27.447 --> 13:29.148
Actually, they didn't. They were
just trying to scare you.

13:29.249 --> 13:32.351
Scare me?
Are you sure?

13:32.452 --> 13:36.188
Positive. Any idea who would
want to do that or why?

13:36.289 --> 13:37.322
Ms. Durbrige.

13:37.423 --> 13:39.424
Vincent--

13:39.526 --> 13:41.059
I mean, Dr. Keller--

13:41.161 --> 13:43.095
what are you doing here?
Uh, I'm a doctor,

13:43.196 --> 13:45.030
I work here. What
are you doing here?

13:45.131 --> 13:47.266
Explosion, victim, cop.
I got this.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.334
(whispers): You think this
victim might be connected...

13:49.435 --> 13:51.603
Yeah, it might be.
Do you mind?

13:51.704 --> 13:55.274
Ms. Durbrige, uh, good news,
no broken bones from the blast.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.109
Uh, you're a very
lucky woman.

13:57.210 --> 13:59.611
Do you have, uh, any idea
who'd want to do this to you?

13:59.712 --> 14:01.847
I just asked her that.
Hmm.

14:01.948 --> 14:03.448
Do you two know each other?

14:03.550 --> 14:05.284
No.
Uh, yeah. We're married.

14:05.385 --> 14:06.752
(Catherine chuckles)

14:06.853 --> 14:09.454
Anyway.
Uh, any ideas?

14:09.556 --> 14:12.791
I don't know. Who knows?
I mean, half the world

14:12.892 --> 14:14.426
hates me because I'm rich,
and the other half hates me

14:14.527 --> 14:16.628
'cause the friggin' paparazzi
love to make me

14:16.729 --> 14:19.798
look like a bitch.
(heartbeat racing)

14:19.899 --> 14:22.634
So you really have no idea

14:22.735 --> 14:24.636
who may have wanted to harm you?

14:24.737 --> 14:26.972
No.

14:27.073 --> 14:29.208
It must be hard
trying to live a normal life

14:29.309 --> 14:32.044
with all those cameras around.
Don't know how you do it.

14:32.145 --> 14:33.779
Still, she can't
keep hiding just because

14:33.880 --> 14:36.615
she's afraid of getting caught,
now, can she?

14:36.716 --> 14:38.150
Yeah, but if you do
get caught, life can never

14:38.251 --> 14:40.152
be the same,
everything is ruined.

14:40.253 --> 14:42.254
Are you guys
still talking about me?

14:42.355 --> 14:44.089
Yes.
No.

14:45.992 --> 14:48.493
Doctor, a moment, please?
Outside.

14:48.595 --> 14:50.062
Excuse me.

14:50.163 --> 14:52.331
Vincent,
what are you doing?

14:52.432 --> 14:54.600
I told you I'd let you know
if I found something.

14:54.701 --> 14:56.001
Oh, so hacking into DHS

14:56.102 --> 14:57.302
and someone trying
to blow up people

14:57.403 --> 14:59.404
is-is what--
it doesn't count?

14:59.505 --> 15:01.045
JT told you
about the hack, didn't he?

15:01.069 --> 15:02.708
Well, I-I made him.

15:02.709 --> 15:04.977
Vincent, you are
supposed to be laying low.

15:05.078 --> 15:07.412
Especially now, with all
of Bootsy's paparazzi around.

15:07.513 --> 15:08.647
She's lying, Catherine, okay?
She knows

15:08.748 --> 15:09.948
more than she's letting on.

15:10.049 --> 15:11.683
Her heartbeat
doubled, her larynx

15:11.784 --> 15:14.086
it-it tightened, and, um...

15:14.187 --> 15:15.921
Beast sense?

15:16.022 --> 15:17.589
Just-just a little bit, okay?

15:17.690 --> 15:18.590
But she-she couldn't tell.

15:18.691 --> 15:19.691
But what if she could?

15:19.726 --> 15:21.293
Oh, she can't tell.

15:21.394 --> 15:22.794
I am just saying that until
we know for sure

15:22.896 --> 15:24.496
what she does or does not know,

15:24.597 --> 15:26.098
we can't be careful enough.

15:26.199 --> 15:28.634
You can't
be careful enough,

15:28.735 --> 15:30.669
which is why I am still
taking the lead.

15:30.770 --> 15:32.604
Oh, come on.
I am going nuts here,

15:32.705 --> 15:34.373
doing absolutely nothing
while all hell

15:34.474 --> 15:37.109
is breaking loose out
there because of me.

15:37.210 --> 15:39.778
Please, let me just at least
talk to her, okay?

15:39.879 --> 15:42.314
Yes, I will see if I
can sense something,

15:42.415 --> 15:44.116
but I'll try and gain her trust.

15:44.217 --> 15:45.984
But it's not like you
can come right out

15:46.085 --> 15:48.487
and ask her about
beast bounties, is it?

15:48.588 --> 15:50.555
Come on, let me see
what I can find out, okay?

15:50.657 --> 15:53.492
I will be careful,
I promise you.

15:53.593 --> 15:54.626
Vincent,
We could lose everything

15:54.727 --> 15:55.894
we've worked so hard for.

15:55.995 --> 15:57.996
I know, I know but we won't.

16:01.834 --> 16:04.403
Okay. But just

16:04.504 --> 16:06.905
be careful what you say
to her, because she's got, like,

16:07.006 --> 16:08.240
ten million followers
on social media,

16:08.341 --> 16:10.208
and anything you say...

16:10.310 --> 16:12.210
Can and will be used against me.

16:12.312 --> 16:14.413
Yeah, I know. I love it
when you talk like a cop.

16:14.514 --> 16:17.549
I hate it when you're charming,
I have no defense.

16:17.650 --> 16:18.984
Yeah.

16:19.085 --> 16:20.819
Okay, I will follow up with JT,

16:20.920 --> 16:22.321
see if he's found any connection

16:22.422 --> 16:24.923
between the hack
and Bootsy and you.

16:25.024 --> 16:27.159
And... let me know
what you find,

16:27.260 --> 16:29.227
but lay low.

16:29.329 --> 16:31.196
No glowy eyes.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.874
Okay, how about
a smile this time?

16:42.976 --> 16:44.209
I was smiling.

16:44.310 --> 16:45.844
Okay, you're the captain.

16:45.945 --> 16:47.346
Let's try another.

16:47.447 --> 16:48.914
No, look, uh... you got plenty,

16:49.015 --> 16:50.615
I got to get back work.
(tapping)

16:50.717 --> 16:52.718
Hey, have you seen Cat?

16:52.819 --> 16:55.053
Oh. Sorry, am I interrupting?

16:55.154 --> 16:57.089
No and yes.

16:58.358 --> 17:00.359
I'll e-mail you the proofs.

17:00.460 --> 17:01.460
Great, thanks.

17:01.527 --> 17:02.894
Tess, are you okay?

17:02.996 --> 17:04.896
Uh, sure, if you forget the fact

17:04.998 --> 17:06.464
that I'm swimming
in all things beast again.

17:06.566 --> 17:08.286
Look, I know we're part
of a greater destiny

17:08.367 --> 17:10.602
and all, but I didn't know
it'd be a life sentence.

17:10.703 --> 17:13.372
Right. That's actually what
I wanted to talk to Cat about.

17:13.473 --> 17:15.707
It's like, just because
I'm in on the big secret now

17:15.808 --> 17:17.448
doesn't mean I can't
have a life, does it?

17:17.477 --> 17:19.317
I thought we were talking about me.
I like Kyle

17:19.378 --> 17:21.813
and he likes me, too.
So, what-- we can't even

17:21.914 --> 17:24.549
go on a date because
he <i>might</i> find out about Vincent?

17:24.650 --> 17:27.884
It's like, I didn't even find out
about it for years, and I'm related.

17:27.885 --> 17:28.720
Look, maybe you
don't want him

17:28.821 --> 17:30.555
to find out, okay?
'Cause then he wouldn't keep

17:30.656 --> 17:32.290
reverting back to helping
Vincent, instead of, you know,

17:32.392 --> 17:34.720
focusing on tenure, or packing.
I just don't

17:34.721 --> 17:36.791
understand.
I have to talk to Cat.

17:36.792 --> 17:38.600
Maybe Cat's right,
maybe I need to get out more.

17:38.601 --> 17:40.732
It's like, I have a future
to worry about, too, you know?

17:40.833 --> 17:42.267
It can't just about them.
Help me clear my head,

17:42.368 --> 17:43.735
I got to stop worrying
about the future

17:43.836 --> 17:45.396
all the time.
Whatever happens, happens.

17:46.739 --> 17:49.808
Thank you so much for listening.

17:49.909 --> 17:51.109
This actually really helped.

17:54.514 --> 17:57.649
Sure, anytime.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.951
I don't get it. You can't find
any connection between Bootsy

18:00.053 --> 18:01.753
and beast bounty?
So far, nothing.

18:01.854 --> 18:04.456
Which means if the explosion
is connected to the hack...

18:04.557 --> 18:07.926
Then Bootsy Durbrige was the
sole intended target. But why?

18:08.027 --> 18:09.761
It's not like
she was in hiding,

18:09.862 --> 18:11.797
so why go through the trouble
of hacking into DHS

18:11.898 --> 18:13.799
to go after her?
Well, she may not

18:13.900 --> 18:16.134
be in hiding, but according to
Vincent, she's hiding something.

18:16.235 --> 18:18.203
And DHS had files
on her for a reason,

18:18.304 --> 18:21.106
although they're encrypted,
so I don't know why.

18:21.207 --> 18:23.375
It is looking more and more

18:23.476 --> 18:26.478
like this hack has nothing
to do with beast bounties.

18:26.579 --> 18:29.448
Do you think I'm trying
too hard to find a connection

18:29.549 --> 18:31.783
because I want to move on
with my damn life?

18:31.884 --> 18:34.352
Maybe. But even if
it is unrelated,

18:34.454 --> 18:36.054
Vincent's files
were stolen, too.

18:36.155 --> 18:38.023
Which means the hackers might
not know what they have yet,

18:38.124 --> 18:39.991
but if they figure it out...

18:40.093 --> 18:41.993
Vincent could be exposed anyway.
Either way, he's at risk.

18:42.095 --> 18:43.995
So the sooner we find out
who's after Bootsy,

18:44.097 --> 18:45.730
the sooner we get
his files back

18:45.832 --> 18:47.365
before it's
too late.

18:50.136 --> 18:52.070
(heart monitor beeps steadily)

19:02.081 --> 19:03.915
(gasps, shrieks)

19:04.016 --> 19:05.717
DOCTOR: Is that the chart
for the patient in room two?

19:05.818 --> 19:07.686
(muffled shrieking)
(monitor beeps rapidly)

19:07.787 --> 19:08.887
That's odd.

19:10.590 --> 19:11.823
Durbrige's heart rate
just jumped.

19:11.924 --> 19:13.425
Call security, stat.

19:17.663 --> 19:18.797
Hey!

19:21.334 --> 19:22.634
(both grunting)

19:33.279 --> 19:35.213
Hold it, freeze!

19:45.691 --> 19:47.425
Well, bright side?

19:47.527 --> 19:49.127
At least I didn't
get exposed, right?

19:54.430 --> 19:56.898
Well, everything seems fine.

19:56.999 --> 19:59.367
You still feeling
light-headed?

19:59.469 --> 20:00.736
A little.
Yeah, well,

20:00.837 --> 20:02.677
the sedative he gave you
should be wearing off,

20:02.705 --> 20:04.406
so you'll start feeling
better soon, okay?

20:04.507 --> 20:05.407
Here.

20:05.508 --> 20:06.508
Thanks.

20:06.609 --> 20:07.642
For everything.

20:08.778 --> 20:09.778
Really.

20:09.846 --> 20:10.946
Yeah.

20:11.047 --> 20:13.348
You want to tell us
what you're hiding now?

20:13.449 --> 20:15.884
(sighs)
Why do you care?

20:15.985 --> 20:18.787
We may have more in common
than you think.

20:20.790 --> 20:23.024
It's a long story.

20:23.126 --> 20:25.193
VINCENT:
Look, Ms. Durbrige,

20:25.294 --> 20:27.763
you can completely trust us.

20:27.864 --> 20:29.598
Is my family safe?

20:29.699 --> 20:31.133
They're in
protective custody.

20:31.234 --> 20:33.301
Except your sister, Melody--

20:33.402 --> 20:35.303
but she's in London, right?

20:35.404 --> 20:36.772
Right.

20:38.741 --> 20:40.108
(sighs):
Okay.

20:40.209 --> 20:41.777
FBI came to me

20:41.878 --> 20:43.879
last year, believe it
or not, for help.

20:43.980 --> 20:45.247
What kind of help?

20:45.348 --> 20:47.716
The kind only rich people
can give.

20:47.817 --> 20:49.918
And since I was looking
for something good

20:50.019 --> 20:51.253
to do with my life

20:51.354 --> 20:53.488
instead of just partying and...

20:53.589 --> 20:56.224
getting into trouble,
I said yes.

20:56.325 --> 20:59.294
I didn't realize
it might get me killed.

20:59.395 --> 21:01.630
So you know why
someone hacked into DHS.

21:01.731 --> 21:03.531
Probably to find out
where the informants are.

21:05.268 --> 21:07.769
Informants I've used
my family's resources to hide.

21:09.405 --> 21:11.907
Look, the Feds don't
have the budget to lure

21:12.008 --> 21:13.441
wealthy C.I.'s
into witness protection,

21:13.543 --> 21:16.041
so they asked me to bridge
the financial gap.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.467
I thought it was
the right thing to do.

21:17.468 --> 21:18.031
It was.

21:18.055 --> 21:20.373
Except now my whole family's
in danger because of me.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.350
I know how you feel.

21:23.553 --> 21:24.619
And just sitting

21:24.720 --> 21:26.121
on the sidelines doing nothing

21:26.222 --> 21:28.256
doesn't really help, does it?
Vincent.

21:28.357 --> 21:30.492
No. He's right. I mean, now
that they know I'm the one

21:30.593 --> 21:32.460
who hid the informants,
maybe I should just tell them

21:32.562 --> 21:33.862
where they are
to protect my family.

21:33.963 --> 21:35.463
You can't.
And I can't believe that

21:35.565 --> 21:37.632
your family would want you
to do that, either.

21:37.733 --> 21:41.369
Look, we are all
in this together, okay?

21:41.470 --> 21:43.238
(sighs)

21:46.475 --> 21:48.343
Look, you said it yourself,
all right?

21:48.444 --> 21:52.380
If whoever is behind this finds
those files before we find them,

21:52.481 --> 21:54.382
then I'm screwed--
everything about me is gonna be out there.

21:54.483 --> 21:55.851
Yes, but...
So I got

21:55.952 --> 21:57.792
to find them fast, okay?
I got to track the guy

21:57.887 --> 21:59.154
that tried to kidnap Bootsy
from the hospital,

21:59.255 --> 22:00.488
see where it leads.
Okay, Vincent,

22:00.590 --> 22:02.023
we've been through this.
Every move

22:02.124 --> 22:03.992
you make out there
risks exposure,

22:04.093 --> 22:06.092
especially with Bootsy's
paparazzi everywhere.

22:06.093 --> 22:08.663
Okay, but if anyone knows how to live
in the shadows, it's me.

22:08.764 --> 22:10.764
I don't want you to have to live
like that anymore.

22:11.100 --> 22:13.540
What choice do I have if those files
get into the wrong hands?

22:13.636 --> 22:15.370
Then where will we be, right?

22:15.471 --> 22:17.138
Hardly the happily-ever-after

22:17.240 --> 22:19.641
we're trying to get to.
I see what you did there--

22:19.742 --> 22:21.476
you made this
all about the marriage.

22:21.577 --> 22:23.511
Look, I promise you,
I will be so careful.

22:24.947 --> 22:26.248
Uh, wait.
Can you take Bootsy

22:26.349 --> 22:28.683
to JT's first? I think
she'll be safer there.

22:28.784 --> 22:30.051
Why? What are
you gonna do?

22:30.152 --> 22:32.254
I'm gonna ask Tess for help.

22:32.355 --> 22:34.522
TESS:
<i>Are you out of your damn mind?</i>

22:34.624 --> 22:36.925
They're gonna know
I'm not Bootsy from a mile away.

22:37.026 --> 22:38.593
Come on, you
look great.

22:38.694 --> 22:41.062
And it's gonna be dark out.
Here. Put these on.

22:41.163 --> 22:43.098
(sighs)

22:44.667 --> 22:46.001
Perfect.

22:46.102 --> 22:48.036
Not perfect.
Not gonna happen.

22:48.137 --> 22:49.170
(sighs):
Tess.

22:49.272 --> 22:51.072
They texted Bootsy,

22:51.173 --> 22:52.741
and they told her
to meet them tonight

22:52.842 --> 22:54.676
and tell them
where the informants

22:54.777 --> 22:56.544
are hidden-- otherwise
they are going to kill her.

22:56.646 --> 22:58.213
(sighs)
We can't protect

22:58.314 --> 23:00.582
her and her family forever--
you know that.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.717
I can't do it. I can't.
Why not?

23:02.818 --> 23:05.453
Because I'm the captain now--
I don't do undercover anymore.

23:05.554 --> 23:07.455
But you should.

23:07.556 --> 23:09.758
You were great at it,
and you liked it, too.

23:09.859 --> 23:13.395
Remember Brooklyn 12,
the Garcia bust?

23:14.830 --> 23:16.698
(quietly):
Yeah, that was pretty cool.

23:16.799 --> 23:20.535
Right?
But that was then, this is now.

23:20.636 --> 23:22.771
But now is our best chance
to catch these guys,

23:22.872 --> 23:24.606
save innocents,
and move on with our lives.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.241
Isn't that what you want?
How does this

23:26.342 --> 23:27.742
help me move on with my life?

23:27.843 --> 23:30.078
It helps keep Vincent
from maybe being exposed,

23:30.179 --> 23:33.248
which helps keep <i>you</i>
<i>from having to cover for him.</i>

23:34.884 --> 23:37.419
Plus... it gets you
back in the action.

23:40.323 --> 23:42.757
Fine. But if I see this

23:42.858 --> 23:44.793
on the precinct Web site,
I'll fire you.

23:46.529 --> 23:48.930
JT:
<i>Do you know any</i>

23:49.031 --> 23:51.166
of the cases the informants
are gonna testify on?

23:51.267 --> 23:52.400
Who they're hiding from?

23:52.501 --> 23:53.802
Names?
I didn't ask.

23:53.903 --> 23:55.637
I thought the less I knew,
the better. Why?

23:55.738 --> 23:58.907
Might help us figure out
who we're up against.

23:59.008 --> 24:01.776
(JT tapping keyboard)

24:03.579 --> 24:06.348
You a college professor?

24:06.449 --> 24:07.816
Me?
Yeah.

24:07.917 --> 24:09.818
Yeah. Uh...

24:09.919 --> 24:11.820
Hudson University.

24:11.921 --> 24:13.822
But you live here,

24:13.923 --> 24:16.491
in a gentlemen's club
by yourself.

24:16.592 --> 24:17.993
Well, yeah, but I-I'm moving,

24:18.094 --> 24:19.861
to an apartment
with my girlfriend.

24:19.962 --> 24:21.496
Oh.
This place

24:21.597 --> 24:23.898
was just temporary, because...

24:25.534 --> 24:26.868
Long story.

24:26.969 --> 24:30.338
You and your friends seem
to have a lot of those.

24:30.439 --> 24:33.308
So, what's the deal
with Vincent, anyway?

24:34.944 --> 24:36.044
Uh...

24:36.145 --> 24:38.513
what do you mean?
I mean

24:38.614 --> 24:41.483
first he's somehow intuits
I'm hiding something,

24:41.584 --> 24:43.184
and then rescues me

24:43.285 --> 24:45.387
and leaves to go somehow
find the bad guys,

24:45.488 --> 24:47.022
then brings me here
for protection?

24:48.557 --> 24:49.691
Who <i>are</i> you people?

24:49.792 --> 24:51.659
Long story.

gonna get out of here in time?

33:01.618 --> 33:03.452

Come on, Dominic.
You really went through all this

33:09.459 --> 33:11.026
just to die up here today?

33:11.127 --> 33:13.429
There's no possibility of parole
when you're dead, right?

up there, did they?

Uh, I don't
think so.

You don't think so?
CATHERINE: It's okay.

33:41.169 --> 33:43.337
I erased the security footage
from the rooftop.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.238
Oh, great, another cover-up.

33:45.340 --> 33:47.674
It's not exactly moving on
with our lives, right?

33:47.775 --> 33:50.644

34:26.714 --> 34:28.114

Bootsy Durbrige,

35:09.295 --> 35:11.563
daughter of real estate
mogul Franklin Durbrige,

35:11.663 --> 35:13.598
has been secretly working
with the FBI

35:13.699 --> 35:15.833
to house and protect
federal witnesses,

35:15.934 --> 35:17.368
which has put her own

35:17.469 --> 35:19.103
highly privileged life
in danger.

35:19.338 --> 35:21.873
Heath, what are
you doing here?

35:21.928 --> 35:24.529
Feeling annoyed,
that's what.

35:24.631 --> 35:26.332
I called Tess
looking for you,

35:26.433 --> 35:28.167
found out that
that's you guys.

35:28.268 --> 35:30.536
Talk about being
left out of the loop.

35:30.637 --> 35:32.338
Bootsy Durbrige?
Are you kidding me?

35:32.439 --> 35:34.073
So is she a total bitch?

35:34.174 --> 35:35.742
No. No, she's not.

35:35.843 --> 35:38.344
She's actually got
an incredibly good heart.

35:38.445 --> 35:41.013
It's too bad
that nobody gets to see it.

35:41.115 --> 35:44.283
Hmm. Double life, I heard.
Sound familiar?

35:44.385 --> 35:45.885
Yeah, except she got caught.

35:45.986 --> 35:47.420
I feel bad for her.

35:47.521 --> 35:49.856
But if it wasn't for her sister,

35:49.957 --> 35:52.158
she wouldn't have been caught,
right?

35:53.727 --> 35:55.261
Tess told me about Melody.

35:55.362 --> 35:56.796
Said that if it wasn't
for her new boyfriend,

35:56.897 --> 35:58.931
Bootsy might have been
able to keep her secret.

35:59.032 --> 36:00.533
Maybe.

36:00.634 --> 36:02.368
God, I would feel like crap

36:02.469 --> 36:04.737
if I was Melody
and I did that to you.

36:04.838 --> 36:07.940
Which is why
I think I get it.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.375
I understand what you and
Vincent have been trying

36:09.476 --> 36:12.712
to tell me about Kyle.

36:12.813 --> 36:15.114
I may not like it--

36:15.215 --> 36:18.284
I really don't-- but...

36:18.385 --> 36:20.653
right now,
with everything going on,

36:20.754 --> 36:23.256
it's... too risky
to bring someone new

36:23.357 --> 36:25.625
into your lives, so...

36:25.726 --> 36:27.693
I get it.

36:31.532 --> 36:33.433
I'm sorry, it sucks.

36:33.534 --> 36:35.334
Yeah.

36:40.707 --> 36:42.141
(computer trilling)

36:42.242 --> 36:43.943
(footsteps approaching)

36:44.044 --> 36:46.412
I am a genius!

36:46.513 --> 36:48.448
Why? Why?
did you do it?

36:48.549 --> 36:52.452
Erased every single one of the
hacked files, including yours.

36:52.553 --> 36:55.288
Adios, gonzo, sayonara!

36:55.389 --> 36:57.924
Okay, so, you're sure Dominic's
people cannot find out about me?

36:58.025 --> 37:00.860
Positive. Once I knew it was
him, I traced his downloads

37:00.961 --> 37:03.129
to his IP address
and wiped his hard drive clean.

37:03.230 --> 37:06.332
I mean, not that he's gonna need
anything on it anymore anyway.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.334
Yeah. Thank you.
Wait. What-What about DHS?

37:08.435 --> 37:10.937
What about 'em?
Did you erase their files, too?

37:11.038 --> 37:14.173
Please. I mean, I may be a
genius, but I'm not a magician.

37:14.274 --> 37:17.510
Their encryptions have
encryptions. I can't touch that.

37:17.611 --> 37:20.446
Relax. Uh, I'm sure

37:20.547 --> 37:22.148
the Deputy Secretary's
gonna double down

37:22.249 --> 37:23.616
on protection after this

37:23.717 --> 37:26.352
to protect his own ass
as much as yours.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.120
Your secret's safe.

37:28.222 --> 37:30.022
Yeah, for now, maybe.

37:30.123 --> 37:33.392
Now's all you got, pal.
It's all <i>any</i> of us have, which

37:33.494 --> 37:37.163
is why, you know,
I turned down tenure.

37:37.264 --> 37:40.399
What?! Come on, you worked
your whole life for that.

37:40.501 --> 37:43.703
I know, but...
I just couldn't do it.

37:43.804 --> 37:47.807
I'm not sure I even <i>want</i> to
do it anymore. Don't tell Tess!

37:47.908 --> 37:49.508
Don't tell Tess?
Are you kidding me, man?

37:49.576 --> 37:51.010
She's gonna find out anyway.

37:51.111 --> 37:52.411
I know, but I-I-I...

37:52.513 --> 37:54.233
I want to figure out
how to break it to her.

37:54.281 --> 37:55.681
I mean,
she's probably gonna think

37:55.782 --> 37:57.262
that I don't want
to move in with her,

37:57.317 --> 38:00.486
but that isn't even
remotely true, but...

38:00.587 --> 38:02.154
But? But what?

38:02.256 --> 38:03.990
First, I have to figure out

38:04.091 --> 38:06.526
what the hell I was thinking.

38:06.627 --> 38:08.628
Yeah.

38:10.464 --> 38:12.932
(siren blaring,
bicycle bell tinkles)

38:15.602 --> 38:19.472
♪ The blacklist
and its hosts... ♪

38:20.707 --> 38:22.708
Vincent?

38:22.809 --> 38:25.344
Yeah?
What are you doing?

38:25.445 --> 38:27.280
Uh, I thought I'd go for a run

38:27.381 --> 38:28.948
before I hit work,
blow off some steam.

38:29.049 --> 38:30.716
Latte instead?
Oh, okay. Sold.

38:30.817 --> 38:32.552
What, you trying to stop me

38:32.653 --> 38:35.054
from blurring all over
the city again?

38:35.155 --> 38:37.123
I told you, I learned my lesson.
There is no benching you,

38:37.224 --> 38:39.556
especially if we both want to
get out of this in one piece.

38:39.580 --> 38:40.993
Oh, good.

38:40.994 --> 38:43.354
And if we're ever gonna find
who's behind this beast bounty,

38:43.397 --> 38:45.631
we have to do it together,
even if that means

38:45.732 --> 38:47.900
risking you blurring
all over the city.

38:48.001 --> 38:51.003
Agreed. To us.
Together.

38:53.540 --> 38:56.809
Mm. I was really hoping that we
had a lead on all this, too.

38:56.910 --> 38:58.945
I know, I know, but even if,

38:59.046 --> 39:00.947
or when, we find
whoever is after me this time,

39:01.048 --> 39:03.382
there's gonna be a next time
and a next time.

39:03.483 --> 39:05.551
I know.

39:05.652 --> 39:09.055
I guess we just got to learn
how to live our lives.

39:09.156 --> 39:11.324
You know, you have
to keep living your life

39:11.425 --> 39:14.160
until we deal with it.

39:14.261 --> 39:16.329
It's just not gonna
go away, though.

39:16.430 --> 39:19.465
Until we find a way
to make it go away.

39:19.566 --> 39:20.292
Oh, come on.

39:20.315 --> 39:22.315
All right, I don't
know how... yet.

39:23.103 --> 39:25.671
But I still think there's
got to be a way that's better

39:25.772 --> 39:28.574
than having to go into
hiding like Bootsy had to.

39:28.675 --> 39:30.910
And we will find it.

39:31.011 --> 39:33.312
I really hope so.

39:33.413 --> 39:35.281
Hmm.

39:35.382 --> 39:36.916
Mmm!

39:37.017 --> 39:38.994
Wow, latte breath.

39:38.995 --> 39:39.616
Oh, yeah?

39:39.640 --> 39:41.563
Are you gonna try
to take another swing at me?

39:41.564 --> 39:42.858
If you try
to tackle me again.

39:42.882 --> 39:44.374
All right!
