00:58.191 --> 01:00.564
This is not what we agreed to.

01:00.588 --> 01:03.664
It's all I could get.
Please!

01:03.688 --> 01:08.065
- I tried. I tried everything.
- Medicine is expensive.

01:08.087 --> 01:10.846
My medical skills are expensive.

01:10.871 --> 01:14.838
She is only a child.
She doesn't deserve this.

01:14.859 --> 01:17.313
If I agree to help you for a pittance,

01:17.337 --> 01:21.546
others would expect the same.
It wouldn't be fair.

01:28.654 --> 01:33.823
Please! Please!

01:37.007 --> 01:40.354
(Sniffling)

01:48.650 --> 01:53.464
I promise you,
I will find you help.

01:53.758 --> 01:56.857
I'll make it better.

01:58.815 --> 02:02.483
(Sniffling)

02:06.722 --> 02:08.955
I promise you.

02:09.024 --> 02:11.826
(Gasping)

02:16.661 --> 02:20.500
I promise you.

03:11.587 --> 03:13.689
That map that you saw!

03:13.712 --> 03:16.355
Are you sure that this is the right way?

03:16.378 --> 03:18.351
The pillars mark the entrance

03:18.375 --> 03:22.093
to way to the Land of the Dead,
so you'll find your brother.

03:23.967 --> 03:27.948
- Don't give up now.
- Gunnar: Sinbad!

03:30.850 --> 03:33.140
We're going for it!
This is the way!

03:33.164 --> 03:38.074
Of course. Into the void.
What could possibly go wrong?

03:47.150 --> 03:51.120
Hang on!

05:15.294 --> 05:17.150
The plan is simple.

05:17.173 --> 05:19.052
We find my brother and we get him out.

05:19.075 --> 05:22.484
- You make it sound so easy.
- This is the part where I would say

05:22.507 --> 05:26.710
the Land of the Dead goes against
every scientific and medical law out there.

05:27.943 --> 05:30.188
Nobody has to come with me.

05:30.211 --> 05:34.349
I understand I'm asking a lot of you,
so if anybody wants to stay on the ship,

05:34.366 --> 05:36.351
I won't think any less of them.

05:39.243 --> 05:41.724
Of course we're coming with you.

05:42.578 --> 05:45.127
Then let's do this.

05:48.186 --> 05:51.943
Come back alive, all of you.

05:51.961 --> 05:55.671
I cannot sail the ship by myself,

05:55.683 --> 05:58.254
so do not inconvenience me.

06:28.524 --> 06:32.483
My people believe that when you die,

06:32.499 --> 06:38.252
you go to a great and majestic hall
full of heroes.

06:38.276 --> 06:44.749
Fields, that's what I was always told.
Green grass, blue skies, sunshine.

06:46.724 --> 06:49.551
I thought we just become
food for the worms.

06:49.574 --> 06:52.404
Looks like we'll find out
soon enough.

06:59.745 --> 07:04.512
Is this it?
It's just a gate.

07:04.535 --> 07:05.960
Here.

07:10.444 --> 07:11.674
It's locked.

07:13.645 --> 07:15.724
Steadfast.

07:16.264 --> 07:18.014
We won't be able to
break it down either.

07:18.015 --> 07:22.184
Sinbad, why don't you try?

07:24.660 --> 07:28.790
Well, if Gunnar can't open it,
I don't see how I could.

07:28.858 --> 07:31.126
(Lock clicking)

07:41.027 --> 07:44.702
- How did you know...?
- I didn't.

07:44.725 --> 07:47.942
I just... had a feeling.

07:51.165 --> 07:54.681
Last chance to turn back then.

08:48.010 --> 08:50.933
So this is the Land of the Dead.

08:50.957 --> 08:55.991
No,
I think this is what comes before.

08:56.013 --> 09:01.468
The City of Limbo, where lost souls remain,
hanging onto life.

09:01.491 --> 09:06.299
- How do you know so much?
- I've travelled.

09:06.323 --> 09:09.163
- Heard stories.
- It's amazing.

09:09.230 --> 09:16.026
Listen.
No noise, no life, nothing.

09:16.049 --> 09:17.834
Cities are never silent.

09:17.846 --> 09:20.347
(Roaring whoosh)

09:25.671 --> 09:27.312
Wait here.

09:51.464 --> 09:52.736
Jamil.

09:55.491 --> 09:58.109
Brother, are you here?

09:58.117 --> 10:00.459
(Rustling)

10:00.480 --> 10:02.217
Jamil?

10:03.380 --> 10:04.481
Jamil, is that you?

10:06.485 --> 10:07.953
- Did you see it?
- See...?

10:07.976 --> 10:09.632
Something's woken them up.

10:09.655 --> 10:11.613
You don't know what happens
when they get you.

10:11.625 --> 10:14.695
Don't know about the light.
About how they make you see the...

10:14.719 --> 10:16.559
the truth.
(Roaring whoosh)

10:16.560 --> 10:18.726
- They're coming!
- No, please!

10:18.750 --> 10:22.463
I need your help.
I'm looking for my brother.

10:22.486 --> 10:24.500
- His name is Jamil.
- They're here!

11:22.654 --> 11:23.869
What is this?

11:23.892 --> 11:27.484
Celebrations for the Emir's birthday,
of course.

11:27.508 --> 11:31.570
- The Emir, he's alive?
- Of course he is.

11:33.097 --> 11:37.123
Wait, wait, wait. Wait!
None of this makes any sense.

11:37.147 --> 11:38.912
Young man, a word of advice.

11:38.936 --> 11:43.207
Alcohol and the midday sun,
not a good combination.

11:43.275 --> 11:45.300
- Anwar: Sinbad?
- Gunnar: Careful.

11:45.323 --> 11:48.507
Whatever's making that noise,
we don't want to draw its attention.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.303
We need to find him fast.

11:50.327 --> 11:54.918
It seems to me he wouldn't have
ended up here if it wasn't for you.

11:56.368 --> 12:01.397
I've heard you the past few days,
whispering in his ear,

12:01.421 --> 12:03.440
telling him how right
he was to come here.

12:03.463 --> 12:06.430
I supported him.
We all did.

12:09.003 --> 12:14.837
No. You were driving him,
pushing him.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.204
- Gunnar!
- What are you doing?

12:21.215 --> 12:25.161
A fighter like Tiger
would have easily blocked that attack.

12:25.184 --> 12:28.586
She didn't even come close.

12:28.609 --> 12:32.593
This, this is not Tiger.

12:32.616 --> 12:35.271
Who are you
and what are you doing here?

12:35.294 --> 12:38.942
- What's wrong with you? This is Tiger.
- No, it isn't.

12:38.966 --> 12:41.494
Talk.

12:41.518 --> 12:44.698
Or I swear to God,
this will be the last voice you ever hear.

12:56.852 --> 12:59.588
What trap have you led us into?

12:59.611 --> 13:03.493
I am here because
I'm looking for someone too.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.175
- It's not a trap.
- I don't believe you.

13:09.198 --> 13:15.351
Wait. Wait.
She's telling the truth.

13:15.372 --> 13:19.024
She's been inside my head,
but I've been inside hers.

13:19.047 --> 13:23.032
I know why she's here
and it's not to harm us.

13:23.055 --> 13:27.377
Believe me,
if anybody wants to hurt her, I do.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.784
But now's not the time.

13:29.807 --> 13:31.975
We need to find Sinbad first.

13:37.813 --> 13:41.136
You step out of line, and I won't
hesitate to run a sword through you.

13:41.256 --> 13:43.429
(Shouting)

13:50.668 --> 13:51.994
Gunnar!

13:55.540 --> 13:58.715
Dare you try your hand at battling
against the mighty Northlander?

13:58.722 --> 14:01.103
Five dinar gives you the chance.
Five dinar gives you the chance.

14:01.171 --> 14:01.971
Gunnar!

14:04.140 --> 14:06.417
Gunnar, Gunnar.

14:07.415 --> 14:09.415
This is very strange.

14:09.438 --> 14:12.397
We were in the Land of the Dead
and then,

14:12.420 --> 14:15.637
somehow we ended up
in this place and I...

14:17.934 --> 14:21.163
You don't know what I'm talking about,
do you?

14:30.684 --> 14:32.512
- Sinbad!
- What is it?

14:32.536 --> 14:34.474
Whatever it is,
it's going to stop.

14:34.497 --> 14:39.605
It's a part of the Land of the Dead.
It can't be killed.

14:39.672 --> 14:43.829
Even if it can't be killed,
it can be distracted.

14:43.841 --> 14:47.845
The rest of you,
get ready to grab him.

15:37.484 --> 15:38.894
Now!

15:43.166 --> 15:45.433
Hey, cyclops!

16:10.626 --> 16:15.997
(Echoing) Sir, can you hear me?
Sir, are you alright?

16:16.065 --> 16:19.467
Hello?

16:25.740 --> 16:29.076
Careful now.
You're badly hurt.

16:32.429 --> 16:37.097
I was, I was in...
the City of Limbo...

16:39.950 --> 16:43.289
Taryn was there.

16:43.879 --> 16:49.404
Taryn.
Oh, what's happening to me?

16:49.428 --> 16:51.935
You were in a fight.

16:51.958 --> 16:55.939
I was passing through the market.
I saw you lying there, hurt.

16:56.714 --> 16:59.943
I'm a doctor.

16:59.967 --> 17:04.897
Is this real, Anwar.
Is it?

17:04.922 --> 17:07.750
How do you know my name?

17:07.772 --> 17:12.176
Because...
because we're friends.

17:12.201 --> 17:15.559
We've never met before.

17:15.582 --> 17:20.419
What?
No, wait.

17:20.443 --> 17:24.250
We travelled on the <i>Providence</i>.

17:24.273 --> 17:28.036
- We've had so many adventures.
- I was on a ship called <i>Providence</i>,

17:28.048 --> 17:33.602
but I got seasick
and they sent me home.

17:36.174 --> 17:39.262
My father covered it all up.
There's no way you could have known that.

17:51.907 --> 17:54.690
I saw how you changed.

17:55.101 --> 18:00.268
Running away from home,
it made a man out of you.

18:00.292 --> 18:05.554
You were happy.

18:05.578 --> 18:11.205
It's a big world out there.
It's never too late to take a look.

18:14.706 --> 18:19.069
I hate seeing you all like this.

18:19.081 --> 18:22.531
You and Gunnar.

18:22.555 --> 18:25.478
Jamil...
I have to find my brother.

18:25.495 --> 18:31.296
No, no, you need to let me finish
examining you because you're sick.

18:31.319 --> 18:34.874
- More than sick.
- That doesn't matter.

18:34.894 --> 18:37.477
All that matters is that I find him.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.831
I think I'm running out of time.

18:41.545 --> 18:44.437
Find somewhere inside.

18:50.965 --> 18:54.182
Rina, bolt the door.

19:06.410 --> 19:09.893
- He's not responding.
- He's still trapped in the light.

19:09.894 --> 19:12.028
- Then get him back.
- You don't understand.

19:12.097 --> 19:15.282
This is the most powerful place on earth.

19:15.305 --> 19:20.341
Your strength, his doctoring skills,
even my magic, they're not enough.

19:20.356 --> 19:24.251
The only way Sinbad can get out
is to free himself.

19:24.275 --> 19:28.382
That won't happen.
It's designed to make sure it won't.

19:28.406 --> 19:33.073
You were able to get inside her.
Surely you can do the same to him.

19:33.096 --> 19:36.130
- Help him fight it.
- This is different.

19:36.153 --> 19:37.997
The state he's in,
the shock would kill him.

19:38.020 --> 19:40.955
But if we don't try...

19:42.986 --> 19:47.762
Exactly.
Then try. Do it.

20:05.145 --> 20:08.621
(Soft whispering) Sinbad.

20:08.644 --> 20:16.576
(Whispering incantation)

20:16.599 --> 20:24.095
<i>Sinbad.</i>
(Soft whispering incantation)

20:29.169 --> 20:32.937
Yes, can I help you?

20:35.574 --> 20:37.429
Jamil.

20:40.145 --> 20:43.549
Jamil, it's me.

20:43.572 --> 20:47.985
I'm sorry, friend.
You have me at a disadvantage.

20:54.539 --> 20:56.265
Are you alright?

21:00.015 --> 21:03.400
Yeah. If you could, um,
just stop that.

21:05.423 --> 21:10.677
Jamil, it's me. It's me.
It's Sinbad, your brother.

21:10.701 --> 21:14.446
- I don't have a brother.
- You do.

21:14.470 --> 21:16.144
- You do, I'm...
- No.

21:16.145 --> 21:18.699
My mother passed away
when I was little.

21:18.723 --> 21:22.586
She was expecting.
So if you think this is funny, it's not!

21:22.609 --> 21:25.688
- Jamil! Jamil!
- Now get out!

21:28.821 --> 21:34.058
Taryn: (Whispering)
<i>Stay alive, Sinbad.</i>

21:34.081 --> 21:37.298
Stay alive, fight.

21:38.683 --> 21:45.640
My own brother.
It's like I never even existed.

21:45.663 --> 21:51.045
When he told me about
my mother dying with child,

21:51.068 --> 21:55.781
- I think that child was me.
- What I was trying to tell you,

21:55.805 --> 21:57.785
when I was examining you,

21:57.797 --> 22:00.181
this goes against every
natural law I know,

22:00.204 --> 22:04.622
you didn't have a heartbeat.

22:04.645 --> 22:08.138
No... Huh?

22:09.793 --> 22:12.701
I don't know how to say this.

22:12.725 --> 22:15.672
You're dead.

22:53.378 --> 22:57.981
(Whispering)
Stay alive, Sinbad.

23:09.955 --> 23:14.597
No, no, no!
Stay away from me!

23:18.001 --> 23:21.062
Tell me it's not true.

23:21.085 --> 23:25.406
I know what I am.
Tell me it's not true.

23:25.429 --> 23:30.079
It can't be.
I can't be dead.

23:30.103 --> 23:33.227
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

23:33.250 --> 23:36.837
You have a foot in both worlds.

23:36.861 --> 23:43.114
- You're both alive... and dead.
- How is that possible?

23:43.138 --> 23:46.660
How is that possible?

23:48.139 --> 23:49.330
You.

23:49.398 --> 23:55.511
What is it you want with this place?!
What do you want with me?! What?!

23:55.535 --> 23:59.818
I had a daughter, Alehna.

23:59.842 --> 24:02.200
She was ill and she...

24:04.297 --> 24:07.397
I tried everything I could
to get her back.

24:07.420 --> 24:11.246
But this place was too powerful.

24:11.269 --> 24:13.547
And then I met you.

24:13.572 --> 24:17.341
The one person who could open
the door to this place,

24:17.365 --> 24:21.393
a man both dead and alive.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.663
(Distant growling)

24:24.731 --> 24:27.433
There's more than one of
those things.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.645
And it sounds as if they are
getting closer.

24:29.669 --> 24:33.671
Because of you, Sinbad.
Because they know you're different.

24:33.672 --> 24:39.846
A threat. And the Land of the Dead
wants to claim you for its own.

24:39.870 --> 24:41.846
And what happens if they find us?

24:41.847 --> 24:43.548
(Growling)

24:44.880 --> 24:50.373
Life here is a disease.
They would be extinguished.

24:52.424 --> 24:55.259
Because of me.

25:02.147 --> 25:07.737
I was wrong to bring you here.
I'm sorry.

25:17.764 --> 25:20.148
Sinbad!

25:43.874 --> 25:44.838
I'm here!

25:46.971 --> 25:48.375
Come on!

25:50.447 --> 25:51.856
Come and get me!

25:53.238 --> 25:56.895
Come on! Come on!

25:56.920 --> 25:59.118
Come and get me!

25:59.186 --> 26:01.918
(Whistle)

26:01.942 --> 26:04.231
Brother!

26:47.460 --> 26:49.985
(Growling)

26:51.902 --> 26:53.938
You ought to be careful,
brother.

26:53.962 --> 26:57.028
Otherwise you'll end up
as dead as I am.

27:07.100 --> 27:09.884
It's this way, I'm sure of it.

27:09.951 --> 27:10.385
(Distant growling)

27:10.876 --> 27:13.053
- We're too late.
- We're not. Don't say that.

27:13.054 --> 27:16.958
He wouldn't sacrifice himself for us.

27:16.970 --> 27:21.036
- Would he?
- Well, that was sort of the plan.

27:21.729 --> 27:26.285
But luckily,
someone has changed my mind.

27:27.584 --> 27:32.706
Everyone, this is Jamil,
my brother.

27:34.370 --> 27:36.930
When those hideous noises
started ringing out across the city,

27:36.942 --> 27:38.851
I'd never heard anything like it before.

27:38.874 --> 27:42.648
- I knew it must be trouble.
- Yeah, and trouble means Sinbad.

27:43.968 --> 27:47.653
Come on. We'll hide in here
until they calm down, it's safe.

27:50.368 --> 27:53.286
I've mapped this place.
Hidden pathways and passages.

27:53.309 --> 27:55.257
We just need to find the right one.

27:55.281 --> 27:56.737
(Chimes tinkling faintly)

27:56.760 --> 28:01.627
Do you hear that?
That music on the wind, it's...

28:01.651 --> 28:06.743
Can you hear it?
It's an old lullaby.

28:06.767 --> 28:10.272
I used to sing it to my daughter
every night when she was ill.

28:10.295 --> 28:12.751
It means she's here.

28:12.763 --> 28:15.088
She's calling to me.

28:17.542 --> 28:24.795
Sinbad, you have found your brother,
but I have to find my child.

28:25.711 --> 28:28.585
I need your help.

28:38.267 --> 28:40.151
I understand.

28:41.466 --> 28:43.357
You should hurry.

28:43.797 --> 28:47.659
The longer you wait here,
the more of them will come.

28:48.891 --> 28:51.827
Leave while you still can.

29:03.676 --> 29:08.696
Of course, it is your choice.

29:15.619 --> 29:18.204
Wait!

29:41.406 --> 29:43.708
Upstairs.

29:47.681 --> 29:50.182
There are so many things
I can't wait to do.

29:50.206 --> 29:56.250
Feel sea breeze, hear the birdsong,
the dirt in the marketplace.

30:02.553 --> 30:08.097
Sorry. I've just never met
a dead person before.

30:08.828 --> 30:11.934
- It's fine. I'm a doctor.
- Student doctor.

31:22.144 --> 31:24.704
Alehna?

31:29.165 --> 31:31.909
Mother?

31:45.526 --> 31:51.807
I waited so long.
I'd almost given up.

31:51.831 --> 31:56.107
I promised you I would find a way.

31:58.173 --> 32:01.388
We're going home, child.

32:02.140 --> 32:05.073
We're going home.

32:13.417 --> 32:21.611
Thank you, Sinbad of Basra.
I can never repay you.

32:22.434 --> 32:27.911
Sinbad?
I've heard of you.

32:27.935 --> 32:34.194
- You can't have.
- Yes, I heard of your story from others,

32:34.218 --> 32:38.829
and then I read your tale
in this library.

32:38.853 --> 32:42.485
They have the records of everyone
who passed through this city.

32:42.508 --> 32:45.667
- I've been here before?
- Yes.

32:45.690 --> 32:51.009
It gave me hope when I read about you
and how your father saved you.

32:51.033 --> 32:55.255
(Distant thud)

32:57.505 --> 32:59.407
I remember every word.

32:59.431 --> 33:02.389
How you and your mother died
before you were born,

33:02.413 --> 33:07.732
- how your father was a mage, the most powerful...
- No.

33:08.854 --> 33:10.849
We never knew him,
but he was a farmer.

33:10.872 --> 33:13.714
A drunk.
He abandoned us all.

33:13.737 --> 33:19.476
He used that powerful old magic to come here
to save you and your mother.

33:20.293 --> 33:24.130
- And it almost tore this city apart.
- Destroyed our mother.

33:24.154 --> 33:28.052
That's why you are special, Sinbad.

33:28.120 --> 33:31.822
You were a child born out of death.

33:32.542 --> 33:36.759
You always have to be different,
don't you?

33:56.098 --> 33:58.435
(Snarling barks)

33:58.447 --> 34:00.850
Incoming!

34:05.702 --> 34:08.121
They're here!

34:08.523 --> 34:11.734
It gets worse!
They released the hounds.

34:11.746 --> 34:14.717
- Unholy vicious...
- I hate dogs!

34:16.572 --> 34:22.286
- Is there another way that we can get out?
- No, only this door at the front.

34:22.311 --> 34:25.839
This barricade won't hold long.

34:25.907 --> 34:28.876
Well, then we'll go down fighting.

34:29.382 --> 34:32.505
- To the death.
- Actually, maybe not.

34:32.530 --> 34:35.757
I found a map. It's old, hand-drawn,
but it has the library.

34:35.780 --> 34:39.050
Wait. So while we were putting up barricades,
you were browsing books?

34:39.072 --> 34:42.487
We're in a library in the City of Limbo
by the Land of the Dead. I couldn't resist.

34:42.511 --> 34:44.308
Anyway, that's not the point.

34:44.331 --> 34:47.175
The point is that there's a
hidden exit at the back.

34:51.397 --> 34:52.712
This is it.

34:52.735 --> 34:55.243
There's nothing.
There should be!

34:55.266 --> 34:58.906
It's a hidden exit.
Key word, hidden.

34:58.930 --> 35:02.200
Exactly.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.159
(Crashing)

35:10.182 --> 35:12.616
Hurry!

35:19.958 --> 35:22.192
Rina!

35:25.799 --> 35:28.288
Quickly, Rina.

35:28.311 --> 35:30.990
Hurry! Hurry!

35:42.401 --> 35:45.078
The library's amazing.

35:47.629 --> 35:49.085
Move!

35:49.109 --> 35:52.119
Come on, go. Go.

35:55.009 --> 35:57.091
This way! Come on!

36:06.389 --> 36:08.400
Go!

36:08.423 --> 36:10.704
- Gunnar!
- Now?

36:26.748 --> 36:30.329
Man: (Whispers) <i>Alehna.</i>

37:01.208 --> 37:03.240
Alehna?

37:05.846 --> 37:10.026
We need to go.
We need to get out of here.

37:26.072 --> 37:31.547
I have never seen it get dark here before.
That's probably not a good sign.

37:31.548 --> 37:33.456
(Distant growl)
And neither is that.

37:33.468 --> 37:37.340
Don't worry. If we keep ahead,
we can lose them.

37:39.207 --> 37:42.924
Don't worry, brother.
We'll get out of this.

37:43.558 --> 37:47.638
I never waited for you, you know.
I accepted my death.

37:47.662 --> 37:50.091
But something was holding me,

37:50.114 --> 37:52.697
- keeping me in Limbo.
- Me.

37:52.721 --> 37:57.671
- You never gave up on me.
- Let's go home.

37:57.738 --> 38:01.007
(Growling)

38:07.357 --> 38:11.717
Sinbad, go.
Live for the both of us.

38:11.785 --> 38:20.559
No, brother! Jamil! No!
No! No! No!

38:26.750 --> 38:31.716
Jamil, no! No! No!

38:36.728 --> 38:40.645
Go in peace, brother.

39:46.818 --> 39:50.988
Ah, just in time.
Special meal.

39:56.452 --> 40:01.783
- How are you holding up?
- Dead, apparently.

40:19.669 --> 40:26.021
Maybe I should have a word with him,
share my wisdom, my experience.

40:54.312 --> 41:00.786
I know. We helped our enemy
and we couldn't save your brother.

41:03.346 --> 41:07.526
I'm so sorry we couldn't save him.

41:16.606 --> 41:22.918
Sooner or later, we're going to run into
something that we can't escape,

41:24.456 --> 41:27.133
that we can't beat.

41:28.026 --> 41:33.233
What, is this the point where you tell me
that we're better off without you?

41:33.256 --> 41:35.619
- Pretty much, yeah.
- Right.

41:35.620 --> 41:43.985
Then I have a speech about
what you saw in the other Basra.

41:44.003 --> 41:47.890
About how our lives would have been
if we hadn't met you.

41:51.301 --> 41:54.169
Sinbad, you saved our lives.

42:00.599 --> 42:07.849
And imagine the adventures still out there,
waiting for us.

42:07.917 --> 42:13.154
You used to be terrified of
that sort of thing.

42:14.295 --> 42:17.225
Well, you are a bad influence.

43:01.291 --> 43:06.270
Sync, corrected by icephoenix

43:10.042 --> 43:15.979
Goodbye, brother.
Go in peace.

43:35.785 --> 43:38.274
- Sinbad!
- Sinbad!
