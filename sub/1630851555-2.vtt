A NETFLIX SERIES

00:35.452 --> 00:37.787
DNA SAMPLES

01:11.196 --> 01:14.324
Easy. Your dad will be here in two hours.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.661
Damn, Víctor!
I thought you were coming with him.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.915
You need to get rid of her.

01:25.668 --> 01:26.878
Did you pack a suit?

01:28.046 --> 01:28.880
No.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.342
Meet me downstairs to go to the store.

01:33.009 --> 01:33.885
Hey, Víctor.

01:35.011 --> 01:38.556
I need you to get the name
of another girl I met yesterday.

01:39.307 --> 01:42.060
I'll give you my firstborn son
if you find out.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.187
You're ridiculous.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.606
I'll be downstairs.

01:52.153 --> 01:56.741
The hostel kept records of 40 women,
half of whom are in the USA.

01:57.242 --> 02:01.663
It's a well-organized network,
we'll get the bigwigs' names from Chango.

02:02.163 --> 02:03.790
I need those names asap.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.542
You'll be the first to know,

02:06.417 --> 02:09.045
if you don't publish anything
until we arrest them.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.091
What are you after?

02:14.342 --> 02:16.553
If my mom kept my birth certificate,

02:16.636 --> 02:19.430
there might be a photo,
a letter, something.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.268
Pass me that one, please.

02:24.727 --> 02:25.562
Thanks.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.862
The fish on the butt
might be pure coincidence.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.948
And you might not be related
to those women.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.409
We'll find out soon enough.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.832
I still don't know whose daughter I am.

02:46.624 --> 02:48.751
Now I really need to find out.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.548
I don't remember much about Mom,

02:53.631 --> 02:57.677
she was always on tour
and vanished when I was nine.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.846
She was a singer.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.556
Well, she is, I think.

03:02.182 --> 03:06.561
She doesn't say much in the postcards
she mails me from all over the world.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.983
So, your mom hasn't said a word
in 20 years?

03:12.066 --> 03:15.695
No, she's like in another world
because of the brain damage.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.742
I visit her every week
at the mental hospital,

03:20.825 --> 03:23.286
but sometimes she won't even look at me.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.081
That's weird.

03:27.832 --> 03:30.251
Valentina's and Bautista's moms died.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.087
Ours are gone.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.298
What did Manny say about hers?

03:37.008 --> 03:37.884
Nothing.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.099
CONTACTS

03:45.183 --> 03:46.059
CALLING MOM

03:48.811 --> 03:51.064
Hello. Who's calling?

03:55.568 --> 03:57.445
MOM

04:01.991 --> 04:05.245
TENERIFE - SPAIN

04:11.834 --> 04:12.669
Laura.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.130
I got a call from a Mexican number.

04:16.214 --> 04:20.260
They hung up, but I know it was her.
I could feel it.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.513
Then we know Manny is alive.
That's what you wanted.

04:23.596 --> 04:26.766
Yes, but where and how do I find her?

04:26.849 --> 04:30.186
If she wanted you to find her,
she would've shown up.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.940
She must loathe the snitch
that sent her to jail.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.905
This is all that's left.

04:40.989 --> 04:44.784
I used the rest to pay the lawyer
that got her out of jail.

04:44.867 --> 04:48.162
Please, only you know how to find her.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.580
If Manny is in Mexico,

04:49.664 --> 04:52.834
it's a matter of life or death
for me to talk to her.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.976
TAXI STAND

05:17.025 --> 05:18.776
Caridad said you were here.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.697
This is all I have about my mom.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.783
If we're connected in any way,

05:26.576 --> 05:28.077
we might find out.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.288
WOMEN WHO LOVE THEATER
NICTÉ MAI

05:30.371 --> 05:31.664
Was she an actress?

05:31.748 --> 05:35.168
Grandma used to say
she'd be like Salma Hayek.

05:39.922 --> 05:41.924
NICTÉ MAI IS A MOM

05:49.098 --> 05:50.308
Are you okay?

05:52.101 --> 05:54.187
I just relived a memory that

05:54.854 --> 05:56.272
I didn't know I had.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.777
But why precisely now?

06:04.655 --> 06:05.490
Hi, Dad.

06:07.867 --> 06:08.701
How are you?

06:13.039 --> 06:14.665
Don't you even have a suit?

06:17.126 --> 06:20.338
Can't you see
it's the one for special events?

06:25.802 --> 06:28.304
Do me a favor, have some strong coffee,

06:29.305 --> 06:30.681
and use some eye drops.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.893
Try to control that hangover.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.733
Why do you want me
at your meeting with the president?

06:40.817 --> 06:43.236
Because I still hope my only son

06:43.319 --> 06:46.489
learns that life isn't just about
booze and women.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.951
You just need to stay awake.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.495
Pay attention, learn.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.373
Can you do that?

06:57.750 --> 07:00.878
Yes, Dad.
I promise I'll do the best I can.

07:03.548 --> 07:07.760
"The best I can" is what you said
when you dropped out of law school.

07:26.904 --> 07:28.948
We thought you had sneaked out.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.037
-What now?
-Last night you kept quiet.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.586
Phone your mom
and ask her who your dad is.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.630
If we're sisters,
it's the same guy, right?

07:44.714 --> 07:46.632
You're one deaf singer.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.760
I said I lost contact with her.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.180
Then settle your differences with her.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.891
Stay out of it, nun.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.394
Manny, only your mom can give us a name.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.900
-I don't have her number.
-Liar.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.777
Go to hell.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.072
I'm not happy about this either.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.868
Unfortunately, only you can help us.

08:14.827 --> 08:17.038
It's one phone call.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.000
Then go away
and forget about us if you want.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.502
I was going to pee.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.670
May I?

08:27.673 --> 08:29.091
She's such a baby.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.677
I'll drive, boys.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.476
Spot report.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.771
Nothing new, staying on route,
eta in 15 minutes.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.650
Isn't all this drama going too far?

08:45.733 --> 08:47.568
Your dad is a political target.

08:47.652 --> 08:51.239
His nomination as Minister of Justice
upset a lot of people.

08:51.322 --> 08:55.618
Don't waste your breath, Víctor.
My son's only interested in clubbing.

08:56.869 --> 08:57.745
Let's go.

09:05.253 --> 09:08.881
Miss Bravo isn't in. May I take a message?

09:09.882 --> 09:11.342
We have an appointment.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.719
Where is the restaurant?

09:14.929 --> 09:16.097
Right next door.

09:19.809 --> 09:23.062
-What's Conaculta?
-A government agency.

09:23.771 --> 09:26.274
This is Bautista's mom at an event.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.821
That was when Valentina's mom
was an accounting clerk there.

09:32.989 --> 09:37.743
I didn't know that until I found
these receipts among her things.

09:41.247 --> 09:46.210
I've never heard about that agency,
but I'll ask my grandparents.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.222
I can investigate at the convent.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.617
You thought you'd get away with it, bitch?

10:18.826 --> 10:23.039
You'll pay for smashing my face
and what you stole from me.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.874
Move it!

10:24.957 --> 10:26.459
Let me go, you bastard!

10:27.209 --> 10:29.587
-Shut up!
-Is that Manny?

10:31.339 --> 10:33.049
Walk slowly and act natural.

10:33.883 --> 10:34.717
Manny!

10:35.343 --> 10:36.552
I'm being kidnapped!

10:37.053 --> 10:38.095
Hey!

10:38.179 --> 10:39.138
Help me!

10:39.221 --> 10:40.723
Hey! He's kidnapping her!

10:42.183 --> 10:43.434
Let me go.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.981
-Let go of me!
-Let go of her, you bastard!

10:51.776 --> 10:52.818
Watch it, man.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.654
What's wrong, Víctor?

10:55.196 --> 10:57.031
-Spot report.
-One moment.

10:57.990 --> 11:01.786
Incident at 50 yards.
Change course immediately.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.714
-Víctor, stop the car!
-What, Federico? Don't be stupid.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.098
Get off of me, you bastard!

11:26.894 --> 11:28.521
Where are you going, bitch?

11:32.024 --> 11:33.943
Get out of here, motherfucker!

11:34.026 --> 11:37.321
-Get out of there!
-Take it easy, ladies.

11:37.405 --> 11:41.325
Are you sure you don't know him?
He seemed to know you.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.457
-I insist we call the cops.
-I said no, damn it.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.211
You said there was a reason
for us to meet now.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.171
Was that it? Saving Manny?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.757
Maybe it's something worse

11:57.717 --> 11:59.260
that we'll never find out.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.608
Now what, Víctor? Why did you stop?

12:14.692 --> 12:17.445
Looks like the president
was attacked, sir.

12:18.237 --> 12:21.449
-We need to turn back.
-Damn it!

12:27.037 --> 12:29.790
Hi, Grandpa. Were you near that gunfight?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.001
Please, come in.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.837
I'm glad you're okay, Dad.
We were on our way, but…

12:34.920 --> 12:36.422
I need a shot of tequila.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.178
The president's flying to Mexico City.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.639
They caught the suspects,
but they canceled everything.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.516
The shots came from nowhere.

12:49.226 --> 12:51.353
I thought he'd end up like Colosio.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.025
Why didn't you go to the meeting?

12:56.984 --> 12:59.737
An incident forced us
to change our course.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.782
Nothing to do with Mr. Marroquín
or the attack.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.451
That coincidence
might have kept you alive.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.997
I don't know about you guys,
but I need some air.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.041
You've been on a four-day bender.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.919
Don't you have ten minutes
for your family?

13:18.672 --> 13:20.966
You could be arranging my funeral.

13:21.050 --> 13:24.720
We'd do it with all the honors
you deserve, Grandpa.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.348
Is there anything you don't make fun of?

13:27.431 --> 13:31.185
I just tried to deflate the situation.
That's all.

13:31.894 --> 13:35.022
Of course I'm glad you're okay, Grandpa.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.905
Matilde's spending a few days
at the convent.

13:42.988 --> 13:46.242
The idea was that I'd end up
in Mexico City.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.078
I'm heading there too. I'll contact you.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.622
I'm fed up of Cancún.

13:51.705 --> 13:56.710
Great. All five of us in town.
Let's get a manicure.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.797
When I get some cash…

13:59.880 --> 14:03.217
There's no hurry.
Calling your mom is more important.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.510
I'll think about it.

14:06.303 --> 14:08.347
That's all I can promise. Okay?

14:11.058 --> 14:12.101
Thanks.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.188
Thanks.

14:17.940 --> 14:18.774
For…

14:30.536 --> 14:31.620
Hop in, ladies.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.038
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.165
Lorenzo is my friend.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.919
Lorenzo, meet Matilde, Caridad and Bauti.

14:39.753 --> 14:42.006
-Hop in.
-Let's go.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.174
Allow me.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.385
-Hello.
-Hi.

15:19.460 --> 15:23.714
MEXICO CITY
A FEW DAYS LATER

15:32.181 --> 15:35.059
Go home, Valentina. I don't pay overtime.

15:35.142 --> 15:35.976
In a moment.

15:36.644 --> 15:40.606
Salvador, do you know anyone
who can tell me about Conaculta?

15:40.689 --> 15:42.316
What do you need?

15:42.399 --> 15:46.195
I need to access some employee files
from 25 years ago.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.531
-I think so. I'll let you know.
-Thanks.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.825
Go home, girl.

15:51.909 --> 15:55.245
-I'm going.
-The evening calls for song and wine.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.164
Bye.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.813
Wonderful!

16:20.896 --> 16:22.940
The kids worship you, Matilde.

16:23.023 --> 16:26.777
I love them too, Mother.
I'll miss them so much.

16:26.860 --> 16:30.072
Matilde, Sister Elena
remembers something about my mom.

16:30.656 --> 16:34.952
Alice rarely spoke about herself
before coming to the convent.

16:35.035 --> 16:39.123
But one day she told us
she studied archaeology in Texas,

16:39.206 --> 16:42.001
and she came to Mexico
to work on a project.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.086
Guess where.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.587
In Conaculta.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.925
So, everybody had to know him there.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.595
I'll try to get more information.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.516
Thanks.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.146
My treat.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.524
How's business?

17:07.109 --> 17:08.944
It isn't easy in Mexico City,

17:09.028 --> 17:12.322
but I might rent a unit downtown
with my savings.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.241
Caridad knows the owner.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.409
Awesome.

17:17.202 --> 17:21.874
-Have you heard from Manny?
-I was about to ask you the same thing.

17:51.779 --> 17:52.738
Bye, guys.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.325
Manny.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.242
Mom.

17:58.368 --> 18:02.122
-How did you find me?
-All that matters is that I did.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.583
Are you okay, honey?

18:04.666 --> 18:07.503
I'm fine, after 18 months in jail
thanks to you.

18:08.003 --> 18:09.171
Go to hell.

18:09.254 --> 18:12.049
Manny, please, we need to talk.

18:24.561 --> 18:28.982
Pocho, are you sure about this?
We barely know each other.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.237
I don't want to impose.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.072
The way I see it,

18:36.031 --> 18:38.367
it's a cool professional arrangement.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.286
Man! The bed!

18:49.253 --> 18:51.964
MEXICO CITY VIA CONACULTA WILL ACT
AS A STAGE RESEARCH PLATFORM

18:56.844 --> 18:58.345
-Want to see it?
-Sure.

18:58.428 --> 19:01.056
FOR RENT

20:30.270 --> 20:31.897
You don't need to explain.

20:32.814 --> 20:33.899
Just listen to me.

20:37.903 --> 20:41.114
Reporting you to the police
was my way of saving you

20:41.198 --> 20:43.408
from ending up dead in a ditch.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.287
-Those guys…
-I know. Are you done?

20:47.371 --> 20:49.498
No, Manny. I'm not done.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.000
I paid for ten minutes. Sit down!

20:52.751 --> 20:53.835
I said sit down!

20:58.757 --> 21:03.720
I've always thought you're too smart
to dedicate your life to dancing naked.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.683
I'm not judging you, Manny.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.229
And I swear to God that…

21:13.397 --> 21:17.859
I accept your profession
and I accept what you do.

21:32.374 --> 21:37.212
You're my only daughter,
and I love you with all my heart.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.632
And all I've ever done is to…

21:42.592 --> 21:44.720
To protect you, for you.

21:47.139 --> 21:51.351
And I'm only in this country
I swore never to return to because…

21:52.311 --> 21:54.521
Only because if I lose you, Manny…

21:56.940 --> 21:59.109
I'll have no reason to live.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.122
I'm off in an hour.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.377
I'll be at a cafe down the road
that's open 24/7.

22:51.161 --> 22:54.706
No, my grandparents
remember nothing about Conaculta,

22:54.790 --> 22:58.293
but my mom was in Mexico at the same time…

22:59.336 --> 23:01.671
At the same time she conceived me.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.174
So now it's four of us.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.594
Didn't Manny say
she was born in Mexico too?

23:08.178 --> 23:09.554
That makes five of us.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.933
Haven't we heard from her yet?

23:14.101 --> 23:14.935
No.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.648
Hi, Mommy.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.483
How are you?

23:22.901 --> 23:24.444
It's me, Juana Caridad.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.906
I want you to meet someone.

23:28.865 --> 23:29.866
She is…

23:33.036 --> 23:34.454
a friend.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.748
Her name is Matilde.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.793
It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.274
-What?
-Want to dance?

24:03.233 --> 24:06.695
Maybe you only recognize me
covered in sand under a jetty?

24:07.279 --> 24:09.072
I don't believe in destiny,

24:09.156 --> 24:12.826
but meeting again
in a city of over 20 million people?

24:12.909 --> 24:13.827
That's weird.

24:17.581 --> 24:21.918
I found some financial records yesterday
while I tidied the place up.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.671
I didn't know you were taking
online classes.

24:28.049 --> 24:29.551
I knew this would happen.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.680
That you'd meddle in my life.
This was a big mistake.

24:33.763 --> 24:37.809
Honey, all I want is
for us not to have any more secrets.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.228
Okay, then.

24:42.772 --> 24:43.815
Who's my father?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.235
You said no more secrets.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.321
Nobody important.

24:49.404 --> 24:53.742
We met at a bar, had sex,
I didn't even know his name.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.498
Anything more original? No?

25:02.459 --> 25:03.293
Fine.

25:06.588 --> 25:07.422
Manny.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.425
Manny!

25:11.009 --> 25:12.344
Manny, talk to me!

25:13.428 --> 25:14.304
Manny!

25:16.515 --> 25:18.058
Why does it matter now?

25:19.976 --> 25:21.269
What happened?

25:21.853 --> 25:24.022
Manny, tell me what happened.

25:27.859 --> 25:31.696
You came back not for me,
but to make sure I don't find out.

25:33.281 --> 25:34.574
You're shaking, Mom.

25:35.242 --> 25:39.162
For 25 years, you couldn't care less.
And now all of a sudden?

25:44.000 --> 25:44.834
Manny.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.046
Manny.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.720
Don't be here when I come back.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.202
You said no more secrets.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.009
She didn't come back one day.

26:36.386 --> 26:39.306
They called the Mother Superior
three days later.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.976
It's a miracle she's alive.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.938
A blood test found a huge amount of drugs.

26:47.022 --> 26:49.190
Was she alone when they found her?

26:49.691 --> 26:54.112
Yes. Looks like she met some people
who influenced her that way.

26:58.658 --> 27:03.663
After the poor thing had me,
she was bored to death at the convent.

27:05.332 --> 27:08.585
And she started going out until…

27:08.668 --> 27:11.087
We don't know if she'll recover, do we?

27:11.171 --> 27:12.839
That's what we all want.

27:13.882 --> 27:17.469
Caridad, you stayed
way past visiting hours again.

27:19.346 --> 27:22.265
Our patients
need to comply with the rules.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.770
What was I supposed to think?

27:26.853 --> 27:29.481
I hate saying it,
but it's not the first time

27:29.564 --> 27:32.067
a woman is disappointed by my nude body.

27:36.446 --> 27:37.989
My mom had just died.

27:40.867 --> 27:43.328
They played her favorite song at the bar.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.790
I had too much tequila and…

27:48.041 --> 27:49.959
I had mixed feelings.

27:53.546 --> 27:57.467
So, I don't look that bad naked?

27:59.678 --> 28:01.304
-Thanks. I'll get it.
-No.

28:01.388 --> 28:05.141
It's the least I can do
after what your shrink must've cost.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.357
That's fine, thanks.

28:13.358 --> 28:14.901
We should try it again.

28:16.403 --> 28:21.324
No, I mean going dancing
and having a drink.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.494
-The rest is up to…
-Fate?

28:25.704 --> 28:28.456
It'd be too much.
The poor gal did what she could.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.792
-I have to go.
-You got my number?

28:30.875 --> 28:33.378
-Yes.
-Call me anytime.

28:33.962 --> 28:36.756
Or text me. Valentina.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.800
Bye.

28:54.023 --> 28:54.858
Víctor.

28:56.192 --> 28:57.444
You're a genius, man.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.904
Yes, that's her name.

29:01.322 --> 29:02.198
It was her.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.523
You know I adore you,

29:35.607 --> 29:38.693
so I can't accept
being pushed out of your life.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.781
I'll be at the hotel until I go back
to Tenerife. Love, Mom.

29:44.365 --> 29:45.200
Nothing.

29:45.950 --> 29:49.370
Manny either changed her number
or she's avoiding us.

29:49.454 --> 29:53.208
Or she's scared, facing the truth
can sometimes be tough.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.593
We can't wait any longer.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.096
You open it.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.102
DNA TEST

30:19.609 --> 30:21.236
Ninety-eight percent.

30:21.319 --> 30:26.241
Ninety-eight percent of what, yes or no?

30:26.324 --> 30:31.746
We're reorganizing the president's tour,
but he asked me to speak with you, Simón.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.581
Yes, sure.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.458
I hope you don't mind,

30:35.542 --> 30:39.254
but we need to know
if you have any skeletons in the closet.

30:46.469 --> 30:48.972
How long have you known the family?

30:49.055 --> 30:52.225
It's just a formality.

30:52.308 --> 30:55.812
Simón is the only nominee
that's not a judge.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.606
And the Senate is very thorough.

30:59.732 --> 31:04.487
Your dad is Simón Marroquín,
my own sister's husband.

31:08.324 --> 31:13.621
If you've got any skeletons in the closet,
either recent or old…

31:14.873 --> 31:16.416
Say something!

31:19.085 --> 31:20.962
We're the same man's daughters.

31:21.045 --> 31:24.299
My life is an open book.
I have nothing to hide.

32:50.259 --> 32:52.345
