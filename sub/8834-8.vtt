12:45.917 --> 12:49.000
Come on, Molly.
Cape Suzette's that way.

12:49.083 --> 12:53.709
-Not going without Henry.
-Oh, fine. Bring him along.

12:53.792 --> 12:56.333
Mr. McNee'll be glad to get him back.

12:56.417 --> 13:00.667
Forget it.
I'm his mama and he belongs to me.

13:00.750 --> 13:03.834
Moms can't let their kids down,
you know.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.542
Molly, you can pretend all you want,

13:06.625 --> 13:08.959
but you're never gonna be
that thing's mother.

13:09.041 --> 13:14.250
If he has one, she'd be that way.
Toward that star.

13:14.333 --> 13:17.875
In Encara Valley.
That's where McNee captured him.

13:17.959 --> 13:21.875
Then that's where we're going.
Come, Henry.

13:21.959 --> 13:23.875
Are you crazy?

13:24.750 --> 13:27.959
Think about your mom.
She'll be worried sick.

13:28.041 --> 13:31.125
[Molly]
She doesn't even know I'm gone.

13:31.959 --> 13:34.917
[Rebecca] Where could they be?
Maybe we missed 'em. Maybe...

13:35.000 --> 13:37.542
Oh, Baloo, this is all my fault.

13:37.625 --> 13:40.709
If only I'd spent more time with Molly,
this would never--

13:40.792 --> 13:43.291
Easy, Becky.
We'll find 'em.

13:48.792 --> 13:50.792
[Rebecca]
Baloo! Up ahead! There they are.

13:50.875 --> 13:54.000
There they are, indeed.

13:54.458 --> 13:58.208
Pity to put holes in that pretty hide,

13:58.291 --> 14:01.417
but a stuffed encara's better than none.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.750
No!

14:07.250 --> 14:10.166
My baby!
He cut an oil line.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.750
Hang on! We're going down!

14:20.959 --> 14:22.667
[Molly sneezes]

14:22.750 --> 14:26.208
-Cold?
-Nah. I'm not as cold as before.

14:26.291 --> 14:28.250
Henry's almost dry now.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.917
Oh, no! You know what this means?

14:31.250 --> 14:32.542
That!

14:36.750 --> 14:38.625
[yelling]

14:38.709 --> 14:39.959
[grunting]

14:40.834 --> 14:43.125
Some cloud surfer you are.

14:43.625 --> 14:46.750
Well, excuse me for saving your pigtails.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.125
[crashing]

14:48.208 --> 14:49.458
What was that?

14:51.041 --> 14:55.750
Oh, man. Did anybody get
the number of that mountain?

14:55.834 --> 14:57.750
Baloo?

14:59.625 --> 15:01.583
Baloo, McNee's gone!

15:01.667 --> 15:04.166
He's after the kids!
Come on, we've got to follow him!

15:04.250 --> 15:07.041
He won't catch 'em as long
as they're in the air.

15:07.125 --> 15:11.208
Which is where we'll be
as soon as I fix this oil line.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.375
Don't worry. He won't find us.

15:33.875 --> 15:37.417
You kids!
Where are you?

15:37.500 --> 15:39.792
Come out in the open!

15:39.917 --> 15:44.792
-Not a chance, creep face.
-Would you be quiet?

15:44.875 --> 15:47.542
I ain't got all night!

15:47.625 --> 15:52.250
Molly, listen, you get Henry to the river.
I'll cover you. Go!

15:52.875 --> 15:55.542
Quick, there she goes!

15:55.625 --> 15:56.875
Where?

16:00.458 --> 16:02.417
Blast you, boy!

16:02.500 --> 16:04.250
There's nothing there.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.750
If you're lying, boy...

16:06.834 --> 16:11.500
Now I remember, she dried up and shrunk.

16:11.583 --> 16:15.458
What are you...
I've had enough!

16:16.417 --> 16:18.917
[Kit yelling]

16:19.000 --> 16:21.041
[grunting]

16:29.750 --> 16:33.667
-Well?
-Pretty good for a kid.

16:36.208 --> 16:40.542
Shouldn't be long now, Molly.
Henry's almost home with his mama.

16:40.625 --> 16:44.041
-Mama.
-Yeah...

16:44.125 --> 16:45.125
What's wrong?

16:45.208 --> 16:49.917
He'll have his mom.
I still won't have mine.

16:50.000 --> 16:54.542
Hey, your mom's probably out there
looking for you right now.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.458
I wouldn't count on it.

16:56.542 --> 16:58.208
[thunder rumbles]

16:58.709 --> 17:03.333
-It's sorta stormy, huh?
-Nah. I've seen worse.

17:03.417 --> 17:05.916
-[thunder rumbles]
-Just not so close up.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.791
Getting pretty dry.

17:09.583 --> 17:13.583
Molly, we better fly down
before we fall down.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.834
[yelling]

17:17.000 --> 17:20.375
[Rebecca]
Molly!

17:20.916 --> 17:26.750
-Molly, it's your mom.
-That's impossible.

17:28.250 --> 17:32.625
[Kit]
Rebecca! Baloo!

17:32.709 --> 17:35.041
I heard 'em, Baloo.
I heard 'em.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.417
Baloo!

17:40.500 --> 17:43.417
Baloo! That way!

17:53.625 --> 17:57.458
Becky, no!
It's too dangerous!

17:57.542 --> 18:00.959
It doesn't matter.
She's my daughter.

18:12.083 --> 18:13.417
[Kit]
Rebecca!

18:14.583 --> 18:17.709
Molly! Give me your hand!

18:18.333 --> 18:21.709
No! Henry needs me!

18:21.792 --> 18:24.625
Moms are supposed
to take care of their kids.

18:24.709 --> 18:28.458
Please, Molly! I love you!

18:28.542 --> 18:31.417
I promise I'll spend more time with you!

18:37.083 --> 18:39.208
No!

18:43.583 --> 18:46.667
Molly! Molly!

18:47.709 --> 18:49.917
Mama!

18:53.083 --> 18:55.041
Rebecca, look!

18:56.750 --> 18:59.083
Not so tight, you big lug.

19:04.125 --> 19:07.125
Baloo! Bring us in!

19:18.500 --> 19:22.125
-[Kit] Come on!
-[Molly] Hurry! Before you dry off!

19:31.542 --> 19:33.125
[Rebecca] Got him!

19:35.041 --> 19:36.291
Mama.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.125
You saved him, Mom.

19:38.208 --> 19:42.041
I'm glad, pumpkin,
but you're what's important to me.

19:42.125 --> 19:43.083
Mama.

19:50.333 --> 19:54.834
[Kit] That must be it, Molly.
The Valley of the Encara.

20:03.375 --> 20:04.375
Mama.

20:04.458 --> 20:06.709
But where's Henry's mom?

20:06.792 --> 20:09.291
Baby...

20:09.375 --> 20:11.792
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama...

20:13.875 --> 20:19.834
Now, listen, when your mom gives you
ice cream, don't gobble it up so fast.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.959
OK?
You'll get a tummy ache.

20:24.041 --> 20:27.458
[sniffles]
And try to stay dry.

20:27.542 --> 20:30.625
So you don't catch cold, OK?

20:31.583 --> 20:34.041
I'm gonna miss you, little guy.

20:34.125 --> 20:34.959
[yells]

20:37.500 --> 20:38.500
[all] No!

20:38.583 --> 20:41.667
Yeah, you're gonna help me
catch 'em all now.

20:41.750 --> 20:44.000
Them skins are worth a fortune.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.667
You do as I say
and I'll share it with you.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.583
And if you don't--

20:48.667 --> 20:50.792
Let him go, creep face!

20:50.875 --> 20:54.000
-Or else.
-Or else what?

20:56.542 --> 20:57.458
This.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.208
OK, Molly!

21:03.208 --> 21:07.333
[groans]
Look, get him off! Get him off!

21:07.417 --> 21:11.834
Didn't your mama tell you
it's not polite to sit on people?

21:14.000 --> 21:19.291
Now let me get this straight,
it was all because of this big monster

21:19.375 --> 21:23.208
that gets teensy-weensy
when it's dry, right?

21:23.291 --> 21:27.125
Ah, you fools!
There were dozens of them.

21:27.208 --> 21:29.333
Take me back.
I'll share it with you.

21:29.417 --> 21:32.959
I will. We'll be millionaires.
Come on.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.625
Right, right.

21:34.709 --> 21:39.166
Listen, why don't we just take you
for a nice long rest, huh?

21:39.250 --> 21:43.625
A little safe cell far away
from the big, bad bogey monsters.

21:43.709 --> 21:47.542
Nice work, Kit.
Well, big day tomorrow.

21:47.625 --> 21:49.792
The joint's all ours.

21:49.875 --> 21:54.083
-You mean...
-Yep. The boss is taking the day off.

21:54.166 --> 21:58.041
Said something about having
really important business.

21:59.667 --> 22:01.583
[Rebecca]
"Once upon a time,

22:01.667 --> 22:05.583
there was a brave little girl
and her big, squishy pet

22:05.667 --> 22:08.250
and her mom who loved her very much."

22:08.333 --> 22:12.917
That's not how
<i>Gladys and the Gorilla </i> goes, Mom.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.542
It does now.
