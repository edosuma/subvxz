WEBVTT

00:08.509 --> 00:12.012
Jackie: "History is a nightmare
from which I'm trying to wake."

00:12.380 --> 00:14.782
I read that in a survey class
at City College,

00:14.815 --> 00:17.718
and I always wondered
if it was actually possible.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.019
Larry...

00:19.053 --> 00:24.858
**

00:24.892 --> 00:28.162
Mom, what are you doing?

00:28.196 --> 00:31.632
Jackie: The more I read
Harwood Fritz Merrill...

00:31.665 --> 00:35.836
Jackie and Blaise:
...the more I believe it is.

00:35.869 --> 00:41.842
**

00:41.875 --> 00:43.977
They're gonna call me
if you ditch school,

00:44.011 --> 00:45.279
so no monkey business.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.914
Yeah, I'm goin'. Geez.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.583
And wash that bowl
when you're finished.
I'm late for work.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.051
I love you, Larry.

00:51.085 --> 00:54.255
[Gunfire on TV]

00:54.288 --> 00:57.491
Jackie: It's me and Larry
against the world.
[Chuckles]

01:02.230 --> 01:03.764
[Exhaling sharply]

01:03.797 --> 01:08.436
[Groaning]

01:08.469 --> 01:11.905
[Hisses, exhales deeply]

01:11.939 --> 01:16.177
[Sniffling]

01:16.210 --> 01:18.011
Ugh.

01:18.045 --> 01:21.215
Oh.

01:21.249 --> 01:23.551
Oh, yeah.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.818
Liz: Dud, I'm leaving!

01:24.852 --> 01:27.121
If you wanna catch a ride,
let's go.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.422
Okay.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.424
Um...

01:30.458 --> 01:32.993
Yeah, I'm almost ready.

01:33.026 --> 01:36.897
[Exhales sharply]

01:36.930 --> 01:38.632
[Tires squeal]
Okay, thanks.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.968
Oh, hey, tell Champ that I'm
really sorry I can't come

01:41.001 --> 01:43.437
to his, like, housewarming
party thing tonight or whatever.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.772
Come by later.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.474
His new place
is right around the corner.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.008
I c-- can't.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.144
I just got so much going on
at the Lodge right now.

01:50.178 --> 01:53.080
We're doing Mystic Chords
of Memory tonight.
Right.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.550
It's like this, uh --
like an open mic night thing.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.851
[Groaning] Anyway,

01:57.885 --> 01:59.820
and Blaise --
Blaise is still missing.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.490
We can't find him.
Ah, yeah, I almost forgot.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.458
The case of the missing
apothecary.

02:04.492 --> 02:05.993
[Exhales heavily]
Yeah, yeah.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.696
Really hopin' for
a breakthrough tonight.
Okay.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.298
So...

02:10.331 --> 02:11.665
Alright. Ow.

02:11.699 --> 02:16.870
Um, hey, you sure that you don't
wanna come in?

02:16.904 --> 02:17.871
No, I'm good.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.507
There's nothing in there
for me.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.342
Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Ow.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.043
Yeah. I'm fine.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.112
Just, hey, say hi
to everybody for me, okay?

02:25.145 --> 02:28.849
Have fun tonight.
Okay.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.885
**

02:40.461 --> 02:43.464
**

02:52.240 --> 02:55.243
**

03:06.720 --> 03:09.390
Oh, Jackie.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.459
Jackie: Like many tragedies,
I suppose,

03:11.492 --> 03:14.194
this one begins with an insecure
man --

03:14.228 --> 03:17.130
Wallace Smith,
owner of the second-largest

03:17.164 --> 03:18.466
dry cleaner's in Bixby Knolls,

03:18.499 --> 03:20.801
and Sovereign Protector
of Lodge 49.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.771
He was the first man I'd been
with since Larry's father died.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.639
He was married,
so he so we used the Murphy bed

03:25.673 --> 03:27.174
in the Sentinel Suite.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.510
[Glass shatters]

03:29.543 --> 03:31.545
Did you hear that?

03:34.348 --> 03:35.549
[Knocks on wall]

03:35.583 --> 03:37.385
Wallace: It came
from behind this wall.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.953
[Knocks on wall]
I think there's something
on the other side.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.889
[Knocks on wall]

03:41.922 --> 03:44.925
[Indistinct conversations,
telephones ringing]

03:50.264 --> 03:52.666
You're late -- again.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.668
Have you tried doing it
all alone, Beverly?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.937
Larry's a handful.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.106
Just letting you know,
the new boss?

03:59.139 --> 04:02.676
He's coming from Florida,
where they launch things.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.978
He might not be
so lenient.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.880
I'm doing my best.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.050
At Orbis, I was just another
face in the typing pool,

04:10.083 --> 04:12.920
employee number 4326,

04:12.953 --> 04:14.722
but at the Lodge,

04:14.755 --> 04:17.257
I was someone important --

04:17.291 --> 04:18.992
a keeper of secrets.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.129
This room must've been here
since the beginning...
[Sighs]

04:22.162 --> 04:25.666
...and we're the only ones
who know the way in.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.001
It's beautiful.

04:28.035 --> 04:32.039
I feel like this place
has been waiting for --

04:32.072 --> 04:33.874
For me.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.943
I know.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.912
There are no accidents,
Jackie.

04:38.946 --> 04:43.584
Our job now is to figure out why
I have been shown this room.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.453
This is my path.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.755
Jackie: When you've been erased
from enough stories,

04:47.788 --> 04:49.156
you stop noticing.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.791
Maybe they'll make a bust
of me like this...

04:50.824 --> 04:52.893
I was just happy
to have something

04:52.926 --> 04:56.229
truly different in my life.

04:56.263 --> 04:57.865
Those were happy months,

04:57.898 --> 05:00.100
getting lost in the old books,

05:00.133 --> 05:03.270
learning alchemical codes
and ciphers.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.172
[Snoring]
It would all make sense to me,

05:05.205 --> 05:07.575
like ripples
settling in a puddle,

05:07.608 --> 05:10.578
and everything
is clear for a moment.
[Metal tinking]

05:10.611 --> 05:13.681
But it would ripple away
just as quick.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.949
My favorite book
was a short biography

05:15.983 --> 05:18.819
of Harwood Fritz Merrill
by William Parker.

05:18.852 --> 05:22.089
It described the four chapters
of Merrill's life --

05:22.122 --> 05:23.991
boyhood, war,

05:24.024 --> 05:26.059
his lost decade of wandering,

05:26.093 --> 05:28.962
and his building
of the first lodge in London.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.234
Hermeticism,

05:34.267 --> 05:36.169
quintessence --

05:36.203 --> 05:38.138
these were hard.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.542
But a man recovering
from a catastrophe,

05:41.575 --> 05:46.647
who searches and finds a home,

05:46.680 --> 05:51.519
I could hold that in my arms.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.454
* ...jolly good fellow

05:53.487 --> 05:55.322
* For he's a jolly good fellow

05:55.355 --> 05:59.527
* For he's a jolly good
fellooooow *

05:59.560 --> 06:01.629
* Which nobody can deny

06:01.662 --> 06:04.197
Whoa!
* Which nobody can deny

06:04.231 --> 06:09.603
[Laughter]

06:09.637 --> 06:11.472
Wallace: Those jackasses...

06:11.505 --> 06:14.542
are payin' for drinks
with their bum coins again.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.478
Everyone around town
takes them.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.414
This new Orbis clique,
I'm sick of 'em.

06:20.448 --> 06:23.316
They have no respect
for the hierarchy around here.

06:23.350 --> 06:27.387
[Scoffs] I should ban
their money from the Lodge.

06:27.421 --> 06:30.691
You won't get invited to their
party if you do that.

06:30.724 --> 06:34.495
[Scoffing] Please.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.264
That's the last thing
I want.

06:37.297 --> 06:41.068
Jackie: Wally, of course,
wanted that more than anything.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.471
-So, Wally, dry cleaning...
-Hmm.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.706
...there's some real heavy-duty
science behind that.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.641
[Scoffs] Yes, indeed.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.578
And I've mastered
the chemical process.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.379
Wow...buddy...

06:52.412 --> 06:55.082
tell us about it.
Gladly.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.718
Um, the thing you have to
remember about petroleum solvent

06:57.751 --> 07:00.854
is when you're wor--
[Laughter]

07:00.888 --> 07:03.090
You know, there are secrets
in the Order of the Lynx

07:03.123 --> 07:05.626
that make everything you're
doing at Orbis seem primitive.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.227
The scrolls
that Harwood Fritz Merrill

07:07.260 --> 07:10.598
found in the desert
are said to unlock great power.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.400
[Laughter]

07:13.433 --> 07:16.604
Werner: She's right.

07:16.637 --> 07:19.439
The Sumerians knew about
chemical valances,

07:19.473 --> 07:22.175
splitting the atom,

07:22.209 --> 07:24.377
and here we are,

07:24.411 --> 07:26.814
trying to keep a metal ball
from falling back down to Earth.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.082
["Something Old,
Something New" plays]

07:29.116 --> 07:35.556
**

07:35.589 --> 07:42.029
**

07:42.062 --> 07:44.431
So, anybody could just sign up
and just do whatever they want?

07:44.464 --> 07:47.000
Yeah, man, you can tell stories,
you can sing a song,

07:47.034 --> 07:48.869
you can juggle, whatever.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.038
Or you could talk for two hours

07:51.071 --> 07:53.006
about how you got arrested
in Seattle

07:53.040 --> 07:55.943
for trying to sneak
onto Prince's tour bus!
That's not true.

07:55.976 --> 07:59.279
Prince didn't play in Seattle
on the Purple Rain Tour.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.348
I got arrested in Tacoma.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.851
I had a life
before I became an educator.

08:03.884 --> 08:07.020
Oh. Lot's of dudes
tell war stories.
Oh.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.421
You know, the funny ones,

08:08.455 --> 08:10.658
not the ones
you dream about.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.893
Larry had a bunch
from Vietnam.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.595
I've got my Gulf War
standards,

08:14.628 --> 08:16.063
and, Ernie, man,

08:16.096 --> 08:18.165
that dude  kills
with his Navy shit.

08:18.198 --> 08:21.268
[Chuckles]
Did Ernie -- Did Ernie sign up?

08:21.301 --> 08:22.936
No.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.806
Uh, not a lot of people
signed up.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.641
Don Fab
and the Longshoremen

08:27.675 --> 08:29.643
are gonna do
a special acoustic set.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.478
Should be pretty good.
Oh, that's good.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.647
Otherwise, as emcee,

08:33.681 --> 08:35.783
I'm-a have to riff.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.185
Free jazz of the mind.

08:38.218 --> 08:42.389
It's gonna be a  long,  brutal
night for everybody.

08:42.422 --> 08:43.924
Here's some lemon bars,

08:43.957 --> 08:46.694
just like my estranged
stepmother used to make.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.830
Wow. I am so happy
for you, man.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.832
Homeownership
is the American dream,

08:51.865 --> 08:53.333
and you made it happen.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.235
Jeremy: Man, and I been
lookin' forward to this --

08:55.268 --> 08:57.671
chance to cut loose
for the night.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.172
Mmm!

08:59.206 --> 09:01.942
Mm.
Fair warning, guys.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.444
I might get a little crazy
tonight.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.748
Sarah gave me permission
to do whatever I want.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.283
-Mm.
-Long as I'm back by 10:30.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.586
To an evening
of gargantuan horror.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.787
Oh.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.389
[Chuckles]

09:16.423 --> 09:18.458
Hey, it's Liz!

09:18.491 --> 09:21.962
[Laughs] Hey, guys.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.297
[Echoing] You want me to pick
you up in the golf cart?

09:24.331 --> 09:27.100
[Echoing] What?!

09:27.134 --> 09:28.168
[Grunts]

09:28.201 --> 09:31.404
Want me to pick you up
in the golf cart?

09:31.438 --> 09:32.873
[Distantly] No, it's okay.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.308
I can walk from here.

09:37.645 --> 09:40.013
Okay, let's just say,
for the sake of argument,

09:40.047 --> 09:42.215
that Blaise didn't complete
the Magnum Opus

09:42.249 --> 09:46.053
and he didn't cross into
an invisible world, okay?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.221
So where did he go?

09:48.255 --> 09:49.757
Where's he been
for the last few days?

09:49.790 --> 09:51.558
How did he
get outta here?

09:51.591 --> 09:53.627
Here's a crazy idea --

09:53.661 --> 09:57.297
there's another way in and out
of this room.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.566
No, no.
I've pulled out

09:59.599 --> 10:01.601
every book in this room,

10:01.635 --> 10:03.771
and none open up
to a secret passage. None.

10:03.804 --> 10:07.140
I don't know, there's probably
another false wall

10:07.174 --> 10:09.777
or crawl space or somethin'.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.478
Jesus, Ernie!

10:11.511 --> 10:13.881
Even the  boring  explanation
is  awesome,

10:13.914 --> 10:15.749
and you can't even
get  excited  about it.

10:15.783 --> 10:18.385
I mean -- [straining]
oh, my God.
Ernie: Whoa, whoa.

10:18.418 --> 10:19.953
[Exhales sharply]
I'm good. I'm good.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.088
I'm fine. I'm fine.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.923
I'm just a little sore.
Oh.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.392
Oh! Your wound, man!

10:25.425 --> 10:27.527
It smells horrible.
Yeah, I know.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.663
That's not good, Dud.
[Exhales deeply]

10:29.697 --> 10:32.165
When's the last time a doctor
looked at your leg.

10:32.199 --> 10:36.303
Ernie, my hospital bills
are out of control, okay?

10:36.336 --> 10:37.938
That's why I need
to find Blaise,

10:37.971 --> 10:40.007
because he's the only one
who can help me.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.143
He's also the guy who shot
your wife with a nail gun.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.312
My ex-wife, okay?
Or she will be soon.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.715
I got some paperwork.
But the point is,

10:47.748 --> 10:50.583
is that...[chuckles] it wasn't
Blaise's fault, okay?

10:50.617 --> 10:52.686
Scott, you know, he wouldn't
give him his spa--

10:52.720 --> 10:55.622
I don't blame Scott.

10:55.655 --> 10:59.026
Blaise is headed down
the same path

10:59.059 --> 11:01.228
as Wallace Smith.

11:01.261 --> 11:05.298
This alchemy stuff,
it drives people crazy.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.234
-[Scoffs] No.
-You walk through some doors

11:07.267 --> 11:10.570

Dud...

11:12.505 --> 11:15.776
I'm scared you're goin'
through that door.

11:17.577 --> 11:21.581
That's why I told El Confidente
to go to Mexico without you.

You told El Confidente
to knock me out?!

I didn't know
he was gonna hit you.

I'll go find Blaise on my own.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.260
My new boss at Orbis.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.229
He's Head of Propulsion.
Ah, to hell with him.

[Indistinct monologue]
Jackie: The boys had gotten
under Wally's skin.

12:12.299 --> 12:16.036
We were feeling the sharp
smallness of our world.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.871
I'd felt it before,

12:17.905 --> 12:21.674
but now, for the first time,
I knew a way out.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.777
They couldn't calculate their
way out of a paper bag!

12:23.811 --> 12:25.378
We'll get the scrolls.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.649
What are you talking about?

12:29.682 --> 12:31.251
The scrolls.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.820
Under Lodge 1 in London.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.455
We can bring them back here
to Long Beach.

12:35.488 --> 12:39.092
Jackie: Of course,
Wally said, "That's impossible,"

12:39.126 --> 12:42.362
but I'd come to know
his soft spots.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.732
Soon enough,
it was all his idea.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.367
[Knock on door]

Less of a mildew smell.

[Chuckling]

12:53.540 --> 12:54.975
And the kitchen's sending up
your supper.

12:55.008 --> 12:58.011
The least we can do for you
after your journey.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.446
Thank you, Oliver.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.514
The door is always open
for you in Long Beach.

13:02.916 --> 13:06.353
Oh, uh, I'm afraid there's
a bit of a riot

13:06.386 --> 13:08.055
planned for downstairs
this evening.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.756
We're having
a song and story review.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.358
Come down
if you're in the mood.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.394
Oh, I think we'll be getting
some rest.

13:14.427 --> 13:19.599
[Distant laughter]

13:21.634 --> 13:23.236
Our timing couldn't be better.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.772
They'll all be soused.
-[Giggles]

13:25.805 --> 13:29.809
Now, I just have to find my way
down to the basement,

13:29.843 --> 13:31.879
and then Merrill's crypt
will obviously

13:31.912 --> 13:34.647
be somewhere down there.

13:34.681 --> 13:35.782
Are you okay?

13:35.815 --> 13:38.118
You eat
when you're nervous, Wally.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.719
I eat because I'm hungry.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.821
Now, it may be possible
that I have to force my way

13:41.855 --> 13:44.757
into the south elevator shaft
and then climb down by hand

13:44.791 --> 13:46.759
to see how deep it goes.
[Chuckles]

13:54.501 --> 13:56.836
You're just gonna
have to trust me, Jackie.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.939
I feel very confident
about this.

13:58.972 --> 14:02.209
Very  confident.
[Chewing loudly]

how anyone knew

14:30.703 --> 14:33.873
when they were on their path.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.408
That night,

14:35.442 --> 14:39.212
I knew I was on my path...

Here I was,
looking right into the life

15:01.268 --> 15:04.437
of a man
who had been destroyed by war.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.473
He had seen the worst of men

15:06.506 --> 15:09.276
but insisted they were better.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.178
They had to be.

15:11.211 --> 15:16.716
What universe would entrust
its secrets to a dark heart?

15:16.749 --> 15:19.086
If Merrill could see
behind his story

15:19.119 --> 15:22.689
to a place where catastrophe
was as necessary as joy,

15:22.722 --> 15:24.291
where the impossible turned

15:24.324 --> 15:27.627
just beyond the edges
of our sight,

then so could I.

their own currency,

23:33.913 --> 23:35.748
Everyone knows who you are.

23:35.782 --> 23:38.551
Yes, but at the 49,
I'm just a lowly postulant.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.386
You're a Luminous Knight.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.155
So, what do you say
we call it a wash.

23:43.189 --> 23:46.225
I'm Werner.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.728
I wasn't looking
for another lover.

23:48.761 --> 23:52.031
I was looking for an equal.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.534
So, you like rockets.

23:54.567 --> 23:55.802
Maybe I hate gravity.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.637
[Laughs]

23:57.670 --> 23:59.639
You ever been to a launch?

23:59.672 --> 24:01.508
I imagine
it's how the caveman felt

24:01.541 --> 24:04.210
when he first learned
to light his own fire.

24:04.243 --> 24:07.446
You see in a moment
just how much better

24:07.480 --> 24:09.482
your future's gonna be.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.183
You're an optimist.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.219
An optimist hopes
for certain outcomes.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.220
I engineer them.

24:14.253 --> 24:17.089
[Chuckles]
You're very humble.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.959
Well, we put a prototype
satellite into orbit last week.

24:19.992 --> 24:22.662
Hermes will map the entire world
for us someday.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.196
The entire world?

24:24.230 --> 24:25.765
Mm-hmm.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.399
You know...

24:27.433 --> 24:31.070
some of us  like  to get lost.
[Chuckles]

24:31.103 --> 24:33.906
You boys love to take
all the mystery away.

24:33.940 --> 24:37.644
You needn't worry.
If you'd like to get  lost,

24:37.677 --> 24:39.345
I'm your man.

24:42.214 --> 24:46.452
This may sound
presumptuous, but...

24:46.485 --> 24:49.889
I know you, Jackie.

24:49.922 --> 24:53.059
You like a system
of authority.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.629
Not so much for the boundaries,
more for the nostalgia --

24:56.663 --> 25:00.132
hearth and home,
mom and dad.

25:00.166 --> 25:03.536
Now, maybe it's my...
Kraut heritage,

25:03.570 --> 25:06.205
but I like some order, too.

25:08.374 --> 25:11.578
So here's what I propose.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.946
Sex is a no-go.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.715
Not because
we wouldn't enjoy it,

25:15.748 --> 25:18.284
but because
it's the obvious next step,

25:18.317 --> 25:22.855
and neither of us
are obvious.

25:22.889 --> 25:27.026
Let's skip the lifeless prose
and get to the poetry.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.895
Yes, I wanna put my lips
on yours,

25:28.928 --> 25:31.798
but that's all
we're gonna do.

25:31.831 --> 25:34.967
Let's light the fuse
without a blastoff

25:35.001 --> 25:37.036
and use that rocket fuel
to get somewhere

25:37.069 --> 25:40.573
two people rarely get --

25:40.607 --> 25:42.441
to the truth.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.146
I accept your terms.

25:48.648 --> 25:52.451
**

25:52.484 --> 25:55.988
Jackie: It wasn't easy,
but we stuck to our deal.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.224
For a while, at least.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.802
Hey...
Hey!

26:09.836 --> 26:12.471
Ha.
Uh, y-you -- you caught me.

26:12.504 --> 26:15.908
[Chuckling] I was, uh, just
leavin' ya a special invitation

26:15.942 --> 26:17.844
for tonight's performance.

26:17.877 --> 26:20.112
That's nice.
[Clears throat]

26:20.146 --> 26:22.548
I'm lookin' forward
to seeing you guys.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.751
Don Fab unplugged.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.853
[Chuckling]
Uh, well, actually,

26:26.886 --> 26:28.320
it's, uh...
[inhales deeply]

26:28.354 --> 26:31.390
just gonna be me
and my guitar.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.692
That's great!

26:32.725 --> 26:36.629
Finally,  you're doin'
your  own  thing.

26:36.663 --> 26:39.131
I  knew  you had it in ya.

26:39.165 --> 26:42.034
Well, it's the first song
I've ever written.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.005
It's about you.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.312
[Quietly]
Scott, we need --

26:53.345 --> 26:55.748
Okay, okay, Connie,
just, please.

26:55.782 --> 26:58.651
Um...

26:58.685 --> 27:01.654
just come to the show.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.322
Okay?

27:12.899 --> 27:15.234
Jeremy: Champ,
what's happening to me?

27:15.267 --> 27:17.503
I'm paralyzed by the fear
inside my brain.

27:17.536 --> 27:20.172
[Breathing heavily]
-Whoa, relax.

27:20.206 --> 27:23.409
It's a gentle ride.

27:23.442 --> 27:26.045
Although, maybe all the toxic
stuff in the ground here

27:26.078 --> 27:28.514
is makin' ya hallucinate.
-[Whimpers]

27:28.547 --> 27:29.648
[Footsteps receding]

27:29.682 --> 27:32.551
So, who owns
this place now?

27:32.584 --> 27:34.153
No one seems to know.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.188
My mom worked here
for a little while.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.190
So did my uncle.
Yeah?

27:38.224 --> 27:41.593
In medieval France,
they built cathedrals --

27:41.627 --> 27:46.232
entire economies
based on stone and glass.

27:46.265 --> 27:49.135
Everyone was connected to it.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.938
Here at Orbis,
they built weapons,

27:51.971 --> 27:53.906
and everyone in Long Beach
was connected to them.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.408
Woman: Just checking with our
courier for the delivery.

27:56.442 --> 27:59.946
You see, anything at all
can be currency.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.614
All value resides in faith.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.951
So why do we need anything?

28:04.984 --> 28:09.756
Why can't currency just be
an idea we all have faith in?

28:09.789 --> 28:12.424
[Chuckles] You can't pay
for a sandwich with an idea.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.360
You still need a thing.
[Chuckles]

28:14.393 --> 28:17.096
Well, why can't the idea
be the thing?

28:17.129 --> 28:20.566
Jackie: I was someone else
entirely with Werner.

28:20.599 --> 28:25.637
I slowly came to recognize
the stranger as myself.

28:25.671 --> 28:29.208
Sometimes at lunch, Werner would
make us a special cocktail,

28:29.241 --> 28:31.310
something to provide "lift-off."

28:31.343 --> 28:34.513
Antarctica.
How long were you there?

28:34.546 --> 28:36.648
Not long.
We were just doing some tests.

28:36.682 --> 28:40.753
Wind velocity.
Boring stuff.
[Chuckles]

28:40.787 --> 28:43.122
Mm.

28:43.155 --> 28:46.092
There's supposed to be
a Lynx lodge in Antarctica,

28:46.125 --> 28:49.428
or...[chuckles] maybe
that's just another myth,

28:49.461 --> 28:51.397
like Merrill
coming to California.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.899
Mm.

28:52.932 --> 28:56.602
Or finding the scrolls
in Egypt.

28:56.635 --> 28:59.505
You know, Wallace has been
saying some pretty crazy things

28:59.538 --> 29:01.140
around the Lodge.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.709
Do you believe him?
Of course not.

29:03.742 --> 29:07.579
I mean, can you imagine
if he had the scrolls?
[Chuckles]

29:07.613 --> 29:10.249
It'd be like giving a gun
to a child.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.351
We  do  give guns
to children.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.520
Then we send them to kill
other people's children.

29:14.553 --> 29:17.089
No one's killing children.
[Sighs]

29:17.123 --> 29:20.326
Uh... [Sighs]
Oh, there it is.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.728
I think we're in
the countdown.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.397
[Sighs]

29:25.431 --> 29:28.734
My mother said her hands hurt
whenever she saw weakness.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.138
[Laughs]

29:32.171 --> 29:34.173
Why are you
fighting  gravity?

29:34.206 --> 29:37.343
You should make a rocket
and point it at the ground.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.445
[Lasers zapping]
If you think about it,

29:39.478 --> 29:42.048
sex is just a door
that we go through

29:42.081 --> 29:45.317
to get to the future.

30:00.366 --> 30:04.003
We're stuck in a circle,

30:04.036 --> 30:07.039
but the magic is...

30:07.073 --> 30:09.808
just there,

30:09.842 --> 30:14.146
just...beyond.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.182
Merrill knew.

30:21.053 --> 30:25.291
I want my Larry
to have a good life,

30:25.324 --> 30:28.995
but...
I can feel the world

30:29.028 --> 30:32.164
wants something else.

[Breathes deeply]

[Birds chirping in distance]

30:43.275 --> 30:46.612
If the scrolls are real,

30:46.645 --> 30:48.680
what would you
do with them?

30:50.983 --> 30:56.222
"No man shall practice alchemy
who hath not the purest heart."

30:56.255 --> 30:58.790
I think Thomas Norton
said that.

30:58.824 --> 31:01.260
Yeah, I've been doing
my reading.

31:01.293 --> 31:05.564
I'm a postulant --
eager to learn.

31:05.597 --> 31:09.168
Something tells me you know more
about alchemy than you let on.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.708
Jackie...

31:16.742 --> 31:18.544
what if I told you

31:18.577 --> 31:21.347
there were people
who think like you do?

31:21.380 --> 31:24.116
There is a group of us here
at Orbis

31:24.150 --> 31:26.485
who aren't constrained
by the line

31:26.518 --> 31:28.787
between science and alchemy.

31:31.623 --> 31:36.162
So you guys
have been playing dumb.

31:36.195 --> 31:38.197
You tease Wallace,

31:38.230 --> 31:39.598
but you believe
in the same things.

31:39.631 --> 31:41.367
Wallace is a useful idiot,
bless him.

31:49.275 --> 31:53.379
following the path laid down
by Jung and Pauli.

31:53.412 --> 31:57.283
Long Beach is at the center
of something big.

31:57.316 --> 32:02.388
It's been waiting here
for us all along.

We're going deep,
literally.

36:17.042 --> 36:19.778

36:19.811 --> 36:22.348
So, uh,
if you guys are interested

36:22.381 --> 36:24.049
in getting in on this,

36:24.082 --> 36:27.085
you know, uh,
u-unique opportunity...

36:32.891 --> 36:35.594
I'm sorry.
I-I-I know that this isn't

36:35.627 --> 36:37.496
what Mystic Chords is about,

36:37.529 --> 36:39.698
but I bought all this crap,

36:39.731 --> 36:41.800
and now I'm stuck with it.

36:44.403 --> 36:49.308
I don't know what else to do.

36:49.341 --> 36:53.111
There's, like...

36:53.144 --> 36:56.214
no future out there.

brought down here.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.563
Technically,
it doesn't exist.

37:11.597 --> 37:14.232
Not even your satellite
could find it?

What do you mean?

37:15.601 --> 37:17.503
Hermes.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.170
It's mapping the world.

37:19.204 --> 37:20.205
In a manner of speaking.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.442
It's -- it's more of
a spy bird, in truth.

37:23.475 --> 37:26.645
And we've parked it dead
overhead our communist friends

37:26.678 --> 37:28.914

37:28.947 --> 37:30.081
Why?

37:30.115 --> 37:32.050
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.185
Peace through strength,
Jack.

37:34.219 --> 37:36.622
Can you imagine
the peace we'd have

37:36.655 --> 37:39.358
with the full force
of alchemical power

37:39.391 --> 37:40.992
in our arsenal?

37:41.026 --> 37:43.729
[Laughing] There will be
so much peace,

37:43.762 --> 37:46.598
we'll get bored of it.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.800
You have to trust me,
Jackie.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.836
Jackie: "Trust me."

37:50.869 --> 37:53.038
I'd heard this before.

37:58.477 --> 37:59.911
Did you do it?

37:59.945 --> 38:04.383
Did you decipher
the scrolls?

38:04.416 --> 38:05.851
I'd rather not say.

38:05.884 --> 38:08.587
Uh, there are a lot of
high-level things

38:08.620 --> 38:10.221
in motion right now,

38:10.255 --> 38:12.624
including this...

38:12.658 --> 38:15.594
lucrative little
side project,

38:15.627 --> 38:16.928
an electronic currency

38:16.962 --> 38:19.264
that uses a common
secure ledger,

38:19.297 --> 38:21.633
like an imaginary coin.

38:21.667 --> 38:24.536
I got the idea
after lunch the other day.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.004
I was thinking to myself --

38:26.037 --> 38:27.406
where were --
oh, you were there.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.307
And from there, I drifted

38:29.341 --> 38:33.812
into a dark, empty place.
[Werner speaking distantly]

38:33.845 --> 38:36.314

38:36.348 --> 38:37.749
His wife had left him,

38:37.783 --> 38:41.387
and he was preparing to make
his own departure.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.455
I agreed to go with him.

38:59.070 --> 39:02.173
The liminal state
is always painful,

39:02.207 --> 39:07.579
but there is also ecstasy
in the transmutation

39:07.613 --> 39:11.883
as we realign our quintessence

39:11.917 --> 39:14.352
and become im-immortal,

[Sniffles] I'm sorry.
I don't know anything.

39:38.844 --> 39:42.514
