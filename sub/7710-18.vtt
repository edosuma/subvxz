WEBVTT

00:00.668 --> 00:01.469
I am actually looking forward

00:01.502 --> 00:02.770
to take your daughter
to work day.

00:02.803 --> 00:05.539
I am not great with kids.

00:05.573 --> 00:08.042
But I wanna get better
because I'm getting married.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.811
So I put out a bunch
of extra candy on my desk

00:10.844 --> 00:12.713
so the kids
will come talk to me.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.051
Like the witch
in Hansel and Gretel.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.819
Bribery.
Nice.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.521
Oh, I have more.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.755
It's Pam.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.092
Ms. Beasley
if you're nasty.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.093
Janet Jackson.

00:25.126 --> 00:25.826
Hey, you having
a wardrobe malfunction, or...

00:25.859 --> 00:28.096
You can't
be nasty today.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.632
Oh, God.
Is that today?

00:31.665 --> 00:33.167
I reminded you last night.

00:33.201 --> 00:35.169
Listen, I like kids.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.404
But this is not
a kids environment.

00:36.437 --> 00:39.340
This is like HBO.
No limits.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.841
Who knows
what I'm gonna say?

00:40.874 --> 00:42.110
Crazy stuff.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.744
And it is R rated.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.479
It is not rated G.

00:45.513 --> 00:48.116
I am like Eddie Murphy
in Raw.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.318
And they are trying
to make me into

00:50.351 --> 00:51.785
Eddie Murphy
in Daddy Daycare.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.322
Both great movies,
but still.

00:54.355 --> 00:56.457
Well, I'll be
in my office.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.758
Don't you think
you should say something?

00:57.791 --> 00:58.759
They're cool.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.594
Michael, I think
that as the boss, you should...

01:00.628 --> 01:02.563
Fine fine fine
fine fine!

01:02.596 --> 01:03.731
Hi, children.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.767
I'm Michael Scott.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.637
And I am in charge
of this place.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.706
Uh, how do I make you
understand?

01:12.740 --> 01:15.376
I am like Superman.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.444
And the people
who work here

01:16.477 --> 01:18.446
are like citizens
of Gotham city.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.580
That's Batman.
That's Batman.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.449
Okay, I'm Aquaman.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.783
Where does he live, guys?

01:22.816 --> 01:23.817
The ocean.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.287
I work with
a bunch of nerds.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.464
Mmm.
Hello, tiny one.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.400
Come on.

02:12.433 --> 02:15.869
You are the future.

02:15.903 --> 02:21.575
This is my file cabinet.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.281
Um...

02:27.315 --> 02:31.719
Oh, this is the partition
between my desk

02:31.752 --> 02:35.223
and Angela's.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.858
Abby's my fiance Stacy's
daughter.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.727
I think she'll
have a good time.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.564
I just hope she doesn't
look on my computer.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.535
Actually,
I'd better go check.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.839
Michael, you remember
my daughter Melissa.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.774
Oh, yes.
Hello, how are you?

02:53.807 --> 02:54.808
Good to see you.

02:54.842 --> 02:55.909
Wow, you've really
grown up.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.745
You know what?

02:57.778 --> 02:59.213
Don't mind me saying so.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.815
She is turning into
a stone cold fox.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.218
Better keep the frat boys
away from her.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.853
I'm in 8th grade.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.322
Oh...
She's in middle school.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.657
Yeah,
middle school's amazing.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.991
It is extraordinary.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.493
An extraordinary time.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.562
It's not that children
make me uncomfortable.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.330
It's just that,
why be a dad

03:16.364 --> 03:17.765
when you can be
a fun uncle?

03:17.798 --> 03:19.300
I've never heard
of anyone rebelling

03:19.333 --> 03:20.801
against their fun uncle.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.736
They want how many
spiral pads?

03:22.770 --> 03:25.673
Uh, well, 50.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.008
I over ordered because
they had a back order.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.710
I got permission
to bring Jakey in to work.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.446
Which is great because
he got suspended this week,

03:32.480 --> 03:34.648
and now I don't have to
pay for a sitter.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.718
Can you pull that
down there?

03:37.751 --> 03:40.521
Okay, tell 'em
what you wanted to say.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.655
Do you need any help?

03:41.689 --> 03:44.258
No, thanks.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.360
We'd have to
explain everything.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.729
It's probably just easier
if we do it ourselves.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.365
All right,
I wasn't expecting that.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.933
Let's go draw.

03:52.966 --> 03:56.470
Oh, my God.
She is so cute, I wanna die.

03:56.504 --> 03:59.673
Don't you just
love kids, Angela?

03:59.707 --> 04:02.710
I guess I wouldn't mind a pair
of small, well behaved boys.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.545
God, I cannot wait
to get pregnant

04:04.578 --> 04:07.581
and have babies.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.618
Kelly and I both agreed
that we would just have fun.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.886
And I'm learning
that fun for Kelly

04:12.920 --> 04:16.724
is getting married
and having babies.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.660
Immediately.
With me.

04:19.693 --> 04:20.994
Just compare
last year's orders

04:21.028 --> 04:23.797
with this year's.
Uh-huh.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.833
Yeah, I'm looking
at it right now.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.640
Yes.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.543
We...

04:35.576 --> 04:36.610
Yeah, they're very...

04:38.078 --> 04:40.781
They're different.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.616
Yeah, we can stick
with last year's.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.518
We're just gonna have to
supplement it somehow.

04:44.552 --> 04:49.723
Hey, Abby, do you wanna help me
shred some old documents?

04:49.757 --> 04:51.725
It's actually pretty cool.

04:51.759 --> 04:52.760
No, thanks.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.630
I only have one goal today.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.731
To make one kid like me.

04:57.765 --> 05:00.768
Just one.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.670
What are you reading?

05:02.703 --> 05:05.673
From the Mixed Up Files
of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.875
Oh, best book.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.910
Yeah, but I read it before.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.779
So have I.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.515
Hey, question, if you had
to spend the night in the Met

05:14.548 --> 05:16.717
or the aquarium,
which would it be?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.419
Definitely the aquarium.
Definitely.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.888
Yes.
Glad you said that.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.856
You don't wanna help me
with some of my sales, do you?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.091
'Cause I'm kinda swamped.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.459
Sure.
Really?

05:25.493 --> 05:26.460
Mmm-hmm.

05:26.494 --> 05:29.597
Yes.
And you're Abby, right?

05:29.630 --> 05:30.764
Yeah.
I'm Jim.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.900
Let's sell some paper.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.001
All right.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.604
Let's start with your mom.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.606
Yes.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.074
Well, we can...
Um...

05:42.643 --> 05:44.077
Hey, you know what?
Can I call you back?

05:44.111 --> 05:45.112
I'll call you right back.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.614
Yes, I promise.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.453
Hello.
Can I help you?

05:55.556 --> 05:56.757
You can pick that up
if you want.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.627
That's all right.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.562
Wanna bring it over...

06:01.595 --> 06:04.632
Here, I'll make some room.

06:11.004 --> 06:13.607
My name's Michael.
What's your name?

06:13.641 --> 06:15.709
Sasha.
Nice to meet you.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.611
Ooh!
Oh, you know what that is?

06:17.645 --> 06:19.813
That is a train whistle.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.982
Like I'm the conductor.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.818
But I'm sort of the conductor
of the office here, right?

06:26.720 --> 06:27.921
You wanna try?

06:27.955 --> 06:29.189
Sure.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.691
All aboard for sales!

06:32.460 --> 06:35.563
Next stop,
Cook...camonga!

06:36.597 --> 06:38.632
Ow ow ow ow,
you broke my hand.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.133
There is no way that hurt.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.537
Really? 'Cause she's
pretty strong, Dwight.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.440
Little girl,
come over here.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.809
Shake my hand.

06:48.842 --> 06:52.613
Come on,
I don't have all day.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.583
I didn't feel anything.
Nothing.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.185
You're so weak.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.791
Excuse me, these are
expensive collector's items.

07:03.824 --> 07:04.792
Okay?

07:04.825 --> 07:05.859
Do you have any
computer games?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.695
No, I don't
have computer games

07:07.728 --> 07:09.597
on my work computer.
That would be inappropriate.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.465
Yeah, Meredith doesn't
have any either.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.733
It's so lame here.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.035
You call your mom Meredith?

07:15.068 --> 07:16.103
That's very disrespectful.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.638
Whatever, okay?

07:17.671 --> 07:20.641
You can refer to me
as Mr. Schroot.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.942
That's your name?
Mm-hmm.

07:21.975 --> 07:22.943
Mr. Poop?

07:22.976 --> 07:25.546
Schroot.
Mr. Schroot.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.947
Sure, Mr. Poop.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.552
Schroot.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.594
Are you Mother Goose?

07:43.664 --> 07:46.033
I drink, like,
100 iced macchiatos a day

07:46.066 --> 07:47.901
and practically nothing else.
Wow.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.638
There's a really
cool coffee place, Jitters,

07:50.671 --> 07:52.740
at the Steamtown Mall.
You ever been there?

07:52.773 --> 07:54.508
No.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.577
You've never been to Jitters?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.278
Ryan, you are so dorky.

07:58.311 --> 08:02.850
Give me your number
so I can text you.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.251
Um...

08:04.284 --> 08:05.285
Come on.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.287
Can I have
your email address?

08:07.320 --> 08:08.756
I just thought
you should know...

08:08.789 --> 08:10.157
Mmm

08:10.190 --> 08:12.726
I think something
a little fishy is going on.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.695
A little fishy?
Yeah.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.129
I mean, I've been
noticing them all day.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.565
And I was thinking...

08:17.598 --> 08:19.633
That little girl
is a child!

08:19.667 --> 08:21.969
I don't wanna see you
sniffing around her

08:22.002 --> 08:23.571
anymore this afternoon.
Do you understand?

08:23.604 --> 08:25.272
Yes.
Boy, have you lost your mind?

08:25.305 --> 08:26.273
'Cause I'll help you find it.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.641
Whatcha looking for?

08:27.675 --> 08:29.543
Ain't nobody gonna
help you out there.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.544
Jesus can come
through that door,

08:30.578 --> 08:31.645
and he's not gonna help you

08:31.679 --> 08:32.846
if you don't stop sniffing
after my child.
Okay.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.716
Stanley yelled at me today.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.184
That was one of the most
frightening experiences

08:37.217 --> 08:39.553
of my life.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.698
*

08:50.731 --> 08:52.265
That was Greensleeves.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.701
A traditional English ballad

08:53.734 --> 08:55.168
about the beheaded
Anne Boleyn.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.071
And now,
a very special treat.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.007
A book my granmutter
used to read me

09:00.040 --> 09:01.308
when I was a kid.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.976
This is a very special story.

09:03.010 --> 09:06.947
It's called Struwwelpeter
by Heinrich Hoffmann

09:06.980 --> 09:10.050
from 1864.

09:10.083 --> 09:13.887
The great tall tailor
always comes to little girls

09:13.921 --> 09:16.023
that suck their thumbs.
Are you listening, Sasha?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.858
Right?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.192
And ere they dream
what he is about,

09:19.226 --> 09:21.294
he takes his great
sharp scissors out

09:21.328 --> 09:23.697
and then cuts their thumbs
clean off.

09:23.731 --> 09:24.765
Dwight, Dwight.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.366
What the hell
are you reading?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.901
These are cautionary tales
for kids, Michael.

09:27.935 --> 09:28.902
Yeah, you know what?
No.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.070
No no no no no.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.305
The kids don't wanna hear
some weirdo book

09:32.339 --> 09:34.307
that your Nazi war criminal
grandmother gave you.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.643
What's a Nazi?

09:35.676 --> 09:36.844
What's a Nazi?

09:36.877 --> 09:38.145
Nazi was a fascist movement
in the 1930s.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.247
Don't talk about Nazis
in front of...

09:40.280 --> 09:42.249
You know what?
They're gonna have nightmares.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.284
Why don't you
just shut it?

09:44.317 --> 09:45.719
I was gonna teach the children
how to make

09:45.753 --> 09:47.988
corn husk dolls.

09:48.021 --> 09:51.258
Why don't you just leave,
okay?

09:51.291 --> 09:52.660
Bye, Mr. Poop.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.795
All right,
there goes Mr. Poop.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.697
Now, who likes Dane Cook?

09:56.730 --> 09:57.731
I do!

09:57.765 --> 09:59.132
Children cannot lie.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.701
They are innocent,
and they speak the truth.

10:00.734 --> 10:03.937
And out of the mouths
of babes,

10:03.971 --> 10:07.975
Michael Scott
is freakin' cool.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.916
You know, I never misbehaved
in front of my father.

10:15.949 --> 10:19.286
Because he was a very strict
disciplinarian.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.353
I can only hope my mate

10:20.387 --> 10:23.691
has some of those
same qualities.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.263
This is where
the magic happens.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.265
Right over here,
let me show you this.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.768
See all these?

10:34.802 --> 10:36.103
You know what that is?
That's paper.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.071
This is where
paper comes from.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.006
Any questions?

10:39.039 --> 10:42.242
So, you cut the paper
and dye it and stuff?

10:42.275 --> 10:44.778
No, we don't actually
cut the paper.

10:44.812 --> 10:45.612
That's a good question.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.081
The paper is sent to us
cut and dyed

10:48.115 --> 10:50.050
from a paper manufacturer.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.119
And then we sell it
to a business

10:52.152 --> 10:53.887
for more than
we pay for it.

10:53.921 --> 10:54.888
That's not fair.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.357
No.
Yes, it is.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.259
It's--well, you need someone
in the middle to facilitate...

10:59.292 --> 11:00.260
You're just a middleman.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.829
I'm not just a middleman.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.130
Wait, why doesn't the sawmill
just sell the paper

11:03.163 --> 11:04.397
directly to people?

11:04.431 --> 11:06.934
You are describing
Office Depot.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.869
And they're kind of
running us out of business.

11:08.902 --> 11:12.940
We have better service
than they do.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.374
There's Creed!

11:14.407 --> 11:18.345
Let's take a look
at what he's doing, everybody.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.714
This is Creed.

11:20.748 --> 11:23.150
And he is in charge
of...something, right?

11:23.183 --> 11:24.885
That is correct.
Say hi to the kids.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.854
Hi, kids.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.990
You ever seen a foot
with four toes?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.024
Eww!
What are you doing?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.225
Stop it, stop it!

11:32.259 --> 11:33.393
Just no no no.
No, no!

11:33.426 --> 11:34.762
Would you cut it out?

11:34.795 --> 11:35.763
What is your problem?

11:35.796 --> 11:37.064
No no no.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.166
We're not gonna see
the four

11:39.199 --> 11:41.168
You know,
there's something interesting

11:41.201 --> 11:42.035
about me that you
might wanna know.

11:42.069 --> 11:45.038
I used to be the star
of a kids show.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.040
No way.
It's true, I did.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.208
You serious?

11:48.241 --> 11:49.509
I am totally serious.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.478
There was a show
called Fundle Bundle,

11:51.511 --> 11:53.914
and I was the star.

11:53.947 --> 11:54.915
What?
It's true.

11:54.948 --> 11:55.983
I can prove it.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.050
I can prove it.
Watch this.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.351
Ryan, can you
come here a second?

11:59.987 --> 12:01.388
I would like you to go
to my mother's house

12:01.421 --> 12:02.856
in Dixon City.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.958
And if she's at the pool,

12:04.992 --> 12:06.159
the back kitchen window
should be unlocked.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.394
I want you boost
yourself up.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.561
I want you to go
down to the basement.

12:08.595 --> 12:11.264
In the basement is a tape
labeled Fundle Bundle.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.001
I want you grab it.
I want you to get my guitar.

12:14.034 --> 12:14.935
I want you to get
a tambourine.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.069
Do you know how
to play the tambourine?

12:16.103 --> 12:18.371
I'm already getting the pizzas
from Brenetti's, so...

12:18.405 --> 12:19.372
I can go with him.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.174
No, I will go.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.911
Okay!
Thank you, Ryan.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.245
Good attitude.
Hottest in the office.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.849
All right, now what kind
of pizza do you like?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.083
I don't get why parents
are always complaining

12:30.117 --> 12:32.119
about how tough it is
to raise kids.

12:32.152 --> 12:35.322
You joke around with them.
You give 'em pizza.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.523
You give 'em candy.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.891
You let 'em live their lives.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.226
They're adults,
for God's sake.

12:39.259 --> 12:43.063
I am going to give you
a little blast from the past

12:43.096 --> 12:45.966
of Michael Gary Scott
when he was a child star.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.801
And a show
that you might remember

12:47.835 --> 12:48.936
called Fundle Bundle.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.238
Okay, without further ado,
Ryan?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.974
Bundle, are you read
to come on in?

12:54.007 --> 12:56.109
Yeah!
Let's have some fun!

12:56.143 --> 12:57.310
That is Miss Trudy.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.879
Can't tell
from her costume,

12:58.912 --> 13:00.313
but she had
an amazing body.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.452
Okay, you can fast forward.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.920
And, I want you...
It's coming up--stop!

13:06.954 --> 13:08.121
Stop stop!

13:08.155 --> 13:11.424
Stop.
Yes.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.027
That is Edward R. Meow.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.996
That's pretty funny.

13:16.029 --> 13:19.232
Yeah.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.233
Hey, what's your name?

13:20.267 --> 13:21.902
My name's Chet.

13:21.935 --> 13:22.970
Well, hi, Chet.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.005
Is that Chet Montgomery?

13:25.038 --> 13:26.573
I don't know.
Yeah, that is!

13:26.606 --> 13:28.608
He's the meteorologist
from channel 4.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.344
Checking in with Chet.
Doppler 7.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.146
That guy's legit.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.382
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.084
I wanna be on TV.

13:37.117 --> 13:40.153
And he is on TV now!

13:40.187 --> 13:42.389
Everybody please shut up.
Please.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.957
So you don't miss it.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.259
Okay, next.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.961
So, what's your name?
That's me.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.329
That's me.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.934
Well, what's your favorite
subject in school?

13:53.967 --> 13:54.935
Recess.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.070
Recess.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.872
So, tell me,
what do you wanna be

13:58.906 --> 14:00.240
when you grow up?

14:00.273 --> 14:02.642
I wanna be married
and have 100 kids

14:02.675 --> 14:05.412
so I can have 100 friends.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.381
And no one can say no
to being my friend.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.487
Uh...
Oh, okay.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.256
Well, nice talking with you,
Michael.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.991
Back to you, Miss Trudy!

14:18.025 --> 14:20.027
Hi, everyone,
it's one of my favorite..

14:20.060 --> 14:21.061
Could have sworn there was...

14:21.094 --> 14:22.963
Did you get married?

14:22.996 --> 14:23.964
Uh, no.

14:23.997 --> 14:24.965
Why not?

14:24.998 --> 14:27.500
Uh, it just never happened.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.070
So do you have any kids?

14:30.103 --> 14:31.604
Uh, nope.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.273
Do you have a girlfriend?
I do okay.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.341
Was Chet Montgomery
cool back then?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.976
Yes.
Even I have a girlfriend.

14:36.009 --> 14:36.977
Okay.
All right, okay.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.479
So you didn't get to be
what you wanted to be.

14:39.512 --> 14:45.518
I guess not.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.621
You know, I have
a load of work to do.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.057
So I am going to grab
a slice

14:50.090 --> 14:52.459
of this delish pizza.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.561
And I'm gonna
go do my work.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.563
Bye.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.008
He's not coming out.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.242
He won't pick up
the phone.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.544
I can't believe his mom
dressed him like that.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.579
That's the real tragedy.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.248
Pam, Pam!

15:15.282 --> 15:18.151
I love this guy.

15:27.327 --> 15:30.663
So, Melissa, I met
your mom a couple times.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.565
She's so nice.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.435
Who, Terry?
Mmm-hmm.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.638
That woman is not my mother.
That is my stepmother.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.244
Mr. Poop,
I have to tell you something.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.646
Uh, okay, but first
that's not my name.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.015
You're ugly.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.586
Well, at least I'm not
a horrible little latchkey kid

15:53.620 --> 15:57.557
who got suspended from school,
so...

15:57.590 --> 15:59.192
Meredith!

16:12.639 --> 16:15.342
Yeah?

16:15.375 --> 16:19.312
I think these
belong to you.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.514
Oh, that's okay.
She can keep those.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.750
Believe me,
she has enough toys.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.653
She doesn't need your watch.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.621
Thank you.

16:31.058 --> 16:33.626
Is everything okay?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.562
You have to ask me that

16:35.595 --> 16:37.497
because you work for
human resources.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.500
That's true.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.802
You know, sure,
playing the field is great.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.104
Don't get me wrong.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.338
But there's more to life

16:45.372 --> 16:46.573
than notches
on my bedpost.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.241
Tell me something honestly.

16:48.275 --> 16:52.645
Do you think that it
is too late

16:52.679 --> 16:53.746
for me to have kids?

16:53.780 --> 16:57.150
Well, you need a wife first
or at least a girlfriend.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.119
What about...
Not Jan.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.387
Jan.
Okay.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.454
If you really
wanna have kids,

17:01.488 --> 17:05.792
I guess you could somehow.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.795
Foster parent or something.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.365
Or biologically.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.534
Somehow.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.769
Thanks, that's...

17:16.803 --> 17:21.241
No, that really
means a lot to me.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.178
Hey, does Sasha
have a godfather?

17:25.212 --> 17:26.246
Because...
Yes.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.280
Okay.

17:29.749 --> 17:30.750
Is it okay
if I take one?

17:30.783 --> 17:32.285
Sure.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.587
Thank you.
You're welcome.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.489
Is your job hard?

17:36.523 --> 17:39.626
It's not too bad.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.261
I get to shred things
sometimes.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.262
Do you wanna see?

17:42.295 --> 17:43.563
Yeah.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.298
Really?
Yeah.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.467
Okay.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.703
Um, here it is.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.340
Don't put your fingers
in there.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.543
Cool, huh?
That's so cool.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.645
Yeah.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.613
Yeah, I get to do this,
like, every week.

18:00.647 --> 18:01.481
That's so awesome.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.683
Yes, it is true.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.553
I, Michael Scott,
am signing up

18:06.586 --> 18:08.655
with an online dating service.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.190
Thousands of people
have done it,

18:10.223 --> 18:11.858
and I am going to do it.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.127
I need a user name.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.595
And I have a great one.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.235
Littlekidlover.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.503
That was people will know

18:23.536 --> 18:25.838
exactly where
my priorities are at.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.910
Go ahead.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.380
Do you wanna come over
for dinner tonight?

18:33.413 --> 18:35.848
Oh man, I would love to.

18:35.882 --> 18:39.152
I can't tonight, but can I
come over some other time?

18:39.186 --> 18:41.454
What are you doing?
You never have plans.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.723
Thanks, Kev.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.325
Um, I'm actually going
on a date.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.295
Nice.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.396
Hey, uh, no, please.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.597
You can't leave yet.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.333
There's still one more thing
we need to do.

18:53.366 --> 18:56.636
* You who are on the road

18:56.669 --> 19:00.407
* Must have a code

19:00.440 --> 19:04.544
* That you can live by

19:04.577 --> 19:08.548
* And so become yourself

19:08.581 --> 19:13.386
* Because the past

19:13.420 --> 19:16.456
* Is just a good-bye

19:16.489 --> 19:20.593
* And teach
your children well *

19:20.627 --> 19:21.928
Why does he own a guitar
if he doesn't

19:21.961 --> 19:22.995
know how to play it?

19:23.029 --> 19:27.500
I think he thought his ukulele
skills would transfer.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.905
* And feed them
on your dreams *

19:32.939 --> 19:34.941
My theory is that...

19:34.974 --> 19:41.648
* The one they picked
the one you know by *

19:41.681 --> 19:45.518
* Don't you ever
ask them why *

19:45.552 --> 19:49.222
* If I told you
you would cry *

19:49.256 --> 19:57.297
* You just look at them
and sigh *

19:57.330 --> 19:59.499
* And know they love you

19:59.532 --> 20:00.233
And they do.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.502
Your parents love you
very much.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.503
One more time.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.538
* You... *

20:05.705 --> 20:07.374
The Schroots considered
children very valuable.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.575
In the olden days

20:08.608 --> 20:10.410
the women would bear
many children

20:10.443 --> 20:12.612
so we would have enough laborers
to work the fields.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.647
And if it was an especially
cold winter

20:14.681 --> 20:17.350
and there weren't enough
grains or vegetables,

20:17.384 --> 20:20.953
they would eat
the weakest of the brood.

20:20.987 --> 20:21.954
No!

20:21.988 --> 20:24.324
They didn't eat the children.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.359
It never came to that.
