00:07.620 --> 00:10.180
Hey, Al,
have you seen my curling iron?

00:10.380 --> 00:12.416
Now, Peg, think.

00:12.620 --> 00:15.578
Why would I take something
that makes you look better?

00:17.620 --> 00:20.293
Now, stop bothering me.
I'm on vacation.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.492
You know, that one week out of
the year I get to sit on my butt...

00:23.700 --> 00:26.533
...allowing yours to experience light
and air.

00:27.700 --> 00:30.817
You know, honey, what we need to do
is take a family vacation.

00:31.020 --> 00:33.773
Don't you want your kids
to have at least one happy memory...

00:33.980 --> 00:35.857
...besides your funeral?

00:36.860 --> 00:39.658
Peg, you gonna bury me
when I'm dead?

00:39.860 --> 00:43.296
Dead, napping, not looking.

00:44.140 --> 00:46.096
Once again...

00:49.860 --> 00:51.771
...I have to deliver your mail...

00:51.980 --> 00:55.177
...just because the mailman
is afraid of getting attacked.

00:55.860 --> 00:57.009
Our dog doesn't bite.

00:57.220 --> 00:59.290
It's not the dog he's afraid of.

01:00.940 --> 01:02.658
Oh, Peg, not again.

01:02.860 --> 01:06.136
We just got the pizza boy
to drop the charges.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.135
Oh, look, my travel brochure came.

01:11.340 --> 01:13.376
Why would you send away
for a travel brochure?

01:13.580 --> 01:15.696
You know I never take you anywhere.

01:16.940 --> 01:19.693
Al, I wanna go to Branson, Missouri...

01:19.900 --> 01:24.052
...entertainment capital of Missouri.

01:26.140 --> 01:29.291
Peg, I can't take you
on a vacation now...

01:29.500 --> 01:32.378
...because Larry, there,
would miss us.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.930
That's Lucky.

01:37.020 --> 01:38.612
And I'd be happy to feed him.

01:38.820 --> 01:40.333
To what?

01:42.620 --> 01:45.134
Do you think that if I could
afford a family vacation...

01:45.340 --> 01:46.978
...I would take this family?

01:48.060 --> 01:50.415
Come try our vein-clogging...

01:50.620 --> 01:54.533
...heart-stopping, all-fried buffet.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.537
All-fried?

01:57.660 --> 01:59.537
Even the lettuce?

01:59.740 --> 02:01.810
Oh, but look, Al, I guess we can't go.

02:02.020 --> 02:05.217
The rooms only have twin beds.

02:08.180 --> 02:11.252
Peg, saddle up, lasso the young'uns,
we're Branson-bound.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.100 --> 02:52.215
Yeah.

02:52.420 --> 02:56.493
I told you we'd make it to Branson
on less than a gallon of gas.

02:56.860 --> 02:57.929
Oh, please.

02:58.140 --> 03:01.371
You chained our car
to the back of a Greyhound bus.

03:06.020 --> 03:11.140
Dad, why can't we just have suitcases
like normal people?

03:11.540 --> 03:15.533
Well, we did, till the handles came
off those detergent boxes.

03:18.580 --> 03:21.777
Howdy.
Welcome to the Deliverance Inn.

03:21.980 --> 03:25.734
You'll squeal like a pig
at our hospitality.

03:27.780 --> 03:29.611
Especially you.

03:35.460 --> 03:36.813
We're on a family vacation...

03:37.020 --> 03:39.932
...and we want
the best accommodations 20 bucks...

03:40.140 --> 03:42.449
...and these aluminium cans will buy.

03:42.660 --> 03:46.778
May I suggest the Ned Beatty suite?

03:46.980 --> 03:49.619
There's a back door.

03:54.780 --> 03:57.419
Dad, I wanna go home now.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.975
What do you mean,
you wanna go home? It's great here.

04:00.180 --> 04:03.411
We've only been here 10 minutes,
you made a new friend.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.975
We'll take it. Where's my wallet?

04:06.180 --> 04:09.058
Howdy, y'all.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.409
Oh, God, the gift shops.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.736
Al, it is worth all your money.

04:14.940 --> 04:17.738
The salesgirl says
it's a Bransonie original.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.089
One of a kind.

04:28.460 --> 04:29.813
Now, what are we gonna do?

04:30.020 --> 04:33.137
First, thank your mother
for finding a new way to ruin our lives.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.410
Thanks, Mom.

04:35.740 --> 04:37.458
And second, this vacation is over.

04:37.660 --> 04:39.890
Now, help me push the car back
to the bus station.

04:42.460 --> 04:44.530
When does
the next bus to Chicago leave?

04:44.740 --> 04:46.059
Tomorrow.

04:46.260 --> 04:51.573
6Which means you can join us
for our complimentary canoe trip.

04:57.180 --> 04:59.410
I can't believe
they didn't lock their door.

04:59.620 --> 05:01.929
Would you lock a landfill?

05:02.940 --> 05:04.498
Oh, poor Lucky.

05:04.700 --> 05:08.818
Look, he's so hungry,
he's chewing on one of Peggy's bras.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.934
Yeah, well,
he's probably looking for crumbs.

05:15.700 --> 05:18.089
Well, Jefferson, let's go home.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.576
It's Saturday night,
and you know what that means.

05:23.260 --> 05:26.616
The Romanian coach
and the limping gymnast?

05:30.660 --> 05:32.571
We did that last week.

05:35.380 --> 05:37.371
Hey, hey,
how about Woody and Soon-Yi?

05:37.580 --> 05:39.889
- Too much talking.
- Yeah.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.012
I wanna do something
really different.

05:44.620 --> 05:47.498
Something dirty...

05:47.820 --> 05:49.617
...and trashy...

05:51.300 --> 05:52.858
...and cheap.

05:56.220 --> 05:57.494
Peg.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.856
I'm home.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.449
Hi, Al.

06:20.820 --> 06:23.209
Gee, where's dinner?

06:24.180 --> 06:27.809
Working its way
through my small intestine.

06:28.820 --> 06:32.130
I'm surprised any part of your body
is willing to work.

06:35.620 --> 06:38.817
Whoever thought being them
could be so much fun?

06:39.700 --> 06:42.168
Al.

06:43.340 --> 06:44.978
I want you to come upstairs...

06:45.180 --> 06:49.014
...and try to last longer
than a new Fox sitcom.

06:51.300 --> 06:54.133
Peg, I don't want to.

06:54.340 --> 06:55.853
Who cares what you want?

06:56.060 --> 06:58.130
Pleasure me, shoe drone.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.336
Okay.
I got some more pennies, Dad.

07:08.540 --> 07:10.417
Forget the pennies,
go for the quarters.

07:10.620 --> 07:12.178
There's a silver dollar out there.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.933
Go on out there and get it, Bud.

07:14.140 --> 07:16.256
- Go out there and get it.
- Dad, I'm drowning!

07:16.460 --> 07:17.609
You big baby.

07:17.820 --> 07:21.529
Brain damage doesn't set in
for four minutes. Ask your sister.

07:23.260 --> 07:26.058
What kind of idiots would throw
good money into a fountain?

07:26.260 --> 07:29.457
I hope we meet somebody
really famous...

07:29.660 --> 07:32.538
...like Tammy Wynette.

07:42.140 --> 07:45.212
Spit out the fish.
Spit it up.

07:45.420 --> 07:47.012
Either we all eat
or none of us eat.

07:47.220 --> 07:48.414
I can't breathe.

07:48.620 --> 07:51.259
I know CPR.

08:00.860 --> 08:02.532
Dollar ninety-eight...

08:02.740 --> 08:04.458
...dollar ninety-nine.

08:04.660 --> 08:08.050
Gentlemen, start your fryers,
I'm buffet-bound.

08:09.220 --> 08:11.780
Hey. Hey, you.

08:12.060 --> 08:14.176
Mama, I'm hungry now.

08:14.380 --> 08:17.178
Well, get out your snack, dumpling.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.778
Haven't you ever heard
of sugarless gum?

08:23.980 --> 08:27.370
Oh, no, Mama says
that's the devil's candy.

08:31.820 --> 08:33.811
Sorry, folks, we're closed.

08:34.020 --> 08:36.294
What do you mean you're closed?
You let them in.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.572
And now we've reached
our weight limit.

08:40.620 --> 08:44.374
Oh, Peg, I'm starving. This is just like
being at home but with fringe.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.378
Oh, now, Al, so we don't get to eat.

08:47.580 --> 08:50.777
I mean, this is Branson. I'm sure we
can find something else fun to do.

08:50.980 --> 08:54.416
<i>Like what?
Like sneaking into Hicks on Ice?</i>

08:56.180 --> 08:57.659
Where are we gonna sleep tonight?

08:57.860 --> 08:59.134
I'm cold, I'm soaked.

08:59.340 --> 09:02.491
The desk clerk just offered
to blow-dry me.

09:06.700 --> 09:09.737
Well, you guys are on your own.
I'm covered.

09:12.460 --> 09:15.099
Sweetheart, I'm surprised at you.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.211
Where have you been?

09:18.740 --> 09:20.935
Come on, Daddy,
I'm not that kind of girl.

09:21.140 --> 09:24.052
I was just gonna slip them a Mickey
and roll them.

09:24.540 --> 09:25.973
That's my pumpkin.

09:26.180 --> 09:28.535
Hey, now, wait a minute.
Nobody's rolling anybody.

09:28.740 --> 09:30.458
We're on vacation.

09:32.020 --> 09:34.739
Look, they're having
a country music talent contest tonight.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.659
Yeah, and the first prize is $500.

09:37.860 --> 09:41.011
- Why don't we enter?
- Because we don't have any talent.

09:41.820 --> 09:43.617
Dad, what are you talking about?

09:43.820 --> 09:46.015
Bud, here, does a solo act
every night.

09:48.420 --> 09:53.448
Although he hasn't won a contest
for it since the Cub Scouts, but...

09:55.380 --> 09:58.258
Hey, Al, this talent show
could save our vacation.

09:58.460 --> 10:01.099
We don't know anything
about country music.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.336
We're just poor, simple folk...

10:03.540 --> 10:05.895
...with busted dreams
and a broken Dodge...

10:06.100 --> 10:08.773
...driving down the turnpike of tears.

10:12.260 --> 10:14.569
Let's have a hand for our last entry.

10:14.780 --> 10:19.615
A new mother and daughter
singing sensation, the Juggs.

11:18.340 --> 11:20.900
Well, pickle my eggs.
We got us a winner.

11:21.100 --> 11:24.297
- The Juggs.
- We won, we won.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.252
They won, they won.

11:26.460 --> 11:29.532
Three, four, five hundred dollars.

11:29.740 --> 11:33.096
Actually, I handle the Juggs.
I'm Pa Jugg.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.538
I- I created the Juggs.

11:35.740 --> 11:40.530
Hey, Jughead, I had to sleep
with these jugs to create that jug.

11:40.900 --> 11:44.051
Not only are you gonna open
for Tammy Wynette tomorrow night...

11:44.260 --> 11:46.854
...in the big room,
but if she takes a shine to you...

11:47.060 --> 11:49.574
...she'll take you
on her next world tour.

11:49.780 --> 11:52.453
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I always wanted to drive to Europe.

11:52.660 --> 11:53.615
Oh, my God.

11:53.820 --> 11:58.211
And I'm gonna make millions
and see the Great Mall of China.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.649
I'll audition the backup singers
and learn to say...

12:01.860 --> 12:04.977
..." Can we try it topless?"
in 40 different languages.

12:05.180 --> 12:06.613
<i>Hey, in Japanese it's:</i>

12:21.540 --> 12:23.098
Al.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.178
- Get me some bonbons.
- Get them yourself.

12:30.420 --> 12:33.617
- Pathetic loser.
- Human tar pit.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.055
Take me.

12:41.820 --> 12:44.493
Oh, I finally understand
why they're still married.

12:44.700 --> 12:47.931
Yeah. Okay, I think we've hit
all the Bundy basics.

12:48.140 --> 12:49.971
- What's left?
- Well...

12:50.180 --> 12:56.016
...we haven't let the dog detail
the D'Arcy's Mercedes lately.

12:56.980 --> 12:58.936
Let's do it. Who's gonna stop us?

12:59.140 --> 13:01.893
That candy-ass Jefferson?

13:04.260 --> 13:07.536
Or Marcy,
that pinstriped henpecker.

13:11.940 --> 13:15.057
Do you ever wonder
why that lazy parasite, Jefferson...

13:15.260 --> 13:17.774
...can never hold down a job?

13:20.300 --> 13:23.656
Other than being Marcy's
human rotisserie, and trust me...

13:23.860 --> 13:26.772
...whatever she's paying him,
it's not enough.

13:28.300 --> 13:31.610
Jefferson,
you went past the safe place.

13:34.060 --> 13:36.620
Oh, I'm sorry, lambykins.

13:36.820 --> 13:40.256
You're so good at this,
I got carried away.

13:40.740 --> 13:44.255
- So you were just role-playing?
- Of course.

13:45.140 --> 13:46.459
Get away from me, Peg.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.572
You hopeless Oprah-holic.

13:50.700 --> 13:53.373
- Oh, Al.
- Peg-

13:55.060 --> 13:56.175
Oh, Peg.

13:56.820 --> 14:00.859
There's my little musical meal ticket.

14:03.740 --> 14:05.571
Now, look what I had
made up for you.

14:06.940 --> 14:08.168
They're great, Daddy.

14:08.780 --> 14:11.214
Compliments
of Ms. Tammy Wynette.

14:11.420 --> 14:13.695
You know, Al, I'm so excited
about going on tour...

14:13.900 --> 14:16.858
...but I hate the thought of leaving you
at home for a year.

14:17.060 --> 14:21.338
Your career comes first, pooky.
I don't mind sacrificing.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.209
Mom, Kelly...

14:25.700 --> 14:27.372
...Tom Arnold.

14:29.700 --> 14:32.055
Hey, he earned his money.

14:35.380 --> 14:38.611
I, as your agent, your creator,
the sole reason you exist...

14:38.820 --> 14:41.254
...would like to present to you
your future.

14:44.740 --> 14:45.775
Oh, my God.

14:45.980 --> 14:49.097
Ninety-nine cent shrimp cocktails.

14:49.740 --> 14:52.698
Hey, what's the big deal?
Anybody can put up a sign.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.778
<i>I got your name mentioned
in the Branson Bugle.</i>

14:55.980 --> 14:57.777
Let me see this.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.211
This is so low.

15:00.420 --> 15:03.332
You're both six months pregnant
by Billy Ray Cyrus.

15:04.460 --> 15:09.454
Really? Well, then how come
Mom's showing and I'm not?

15:11.420 --> 15:12.978
I am not showing.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.613
And you're grounded.

15:14.820 --> 15:17.129
Calm down, Mom.
It's bad for the baby.

15:17.340 --> 15:18.375
Hello?

15:18.580 --> 15:20.616
Kelly, you're not really pregnant.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.849
We squeaked by that one, hey, Mom?

15:25.060 --> 15:27.016
Bud, you got that sign all wrong.

15:27.220 --> 15:28.858
I shouldn't be your mother.

15:29.060 --> 15:31.574
That's what child welfare said.

15:32.340 --> 15:34.296
Why can't Kelly be the mom?

15:34.500 --> 15:35.728
I can't be your mother.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.170
I mean, that would make me
my own grandmother.

15:38.380 --> 15:41.816
Well, we are in Branson.
These things happen.

15:42.620 --> 15:44.053
Why are you taking her side?

15:44.260 --> 15:46.569
Now, you told me I was the talented,
pretty one.

15:46.780 --> 15:50.739
Hey, and you told me that that stupid,
cheap blond was holding me back.

15:50.940 --> 15:53.374
Wait, you added a stupid,
cheap blond to the act?

15:53.580 --> 15:54.854
Why wasn't I told? Hello.

15:55.060 --> 15:58.450
Now, see, that's the reason
why you shouldn't be the manager.

15:58.660 --> 16:02.335
You are driving a wedge
between the Juggs.

16:05.740 --> 16:06.889
You're fired.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.533
You can't fire me.

16:08.740 --> 16:10.139
Only they can fire me.

16:10.340 --> 16:12.410
- You're fired.
- You're fired.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.368
Fine. And you know what?

16:14.580 --> 16:16.491
You can go on the road with them,
Dad.

16:16.700 --> 16:19.737
You see, it's bad ideas like that
got you fired.

16:31.060 --> 16:34.609
I'm Tammy Wynette, and I wanted to
stop by and meet my new opening act.

16:34.820 --> 16:35.935
Hi.

16:36.140 --> 16:37.653
Which Jugg are you?

16:37.860 --> 16:39.851
She's the junior Jugg.

16:40.060 --> 16:42.130
And she's the Jurassic Jugg.

16:42.340 --> 16:44.137
Now, girls, girls, girls.

16:44.340 --> 16:45.614
I'm Colonel Jugg...

16:45.820 --> 16:48.050
...and it's a thrill to meet you,
Ms. Wynette.

16:48.260 --> 16:50.251
Oh, yeah. We just love your music.

16:50.460 --> 16:53.975
As a matter of fact, Al and I can't
make love without listening to your CD.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.613
As long as you're listening.

16:55.820 --> 16:59.335
Well, she listens.
I stare at your picture.

17:00.180 --> 17:03.889
I'm delighted and disgusted
at the same time.

17:04.099 --> 17:07.887
Well, now you know
what sex with Al is like.

17:08.300 --> 17:11.053
I think it would be cute to have a
mother and daughter duo...

17:11.260 --> 17:12.295
...to open up my show.

17:12.500 --> 17:16.095
Well, you know, actually,
we're more like a sister act.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.212
Oh, you do comedy too?

17:20.339 --> 17:21.978
Colonel, handle this.

17:22.180 --> 17:24.773
Hey, you guys, I have an idea.

17:24.980 --> 17:26.935
Ms. Wynette can be our mother.

17:27.140 --> 17:29.017
- Yeah.
- No, I can't.

17:29.220 --> 17:30.892
You don't have to decide right now.

17:31.100 --> 17:34.456
Take them on the road for a year.
Give them a try, free of charge.

17:34.660 --> 17:37.458
Hey, what kind of manager are you?

17:37.660 --> 17:38.695
Yeah, Daddy.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.494
You're fired. Bud, handle this.

17:45.900 --> 17:48.539
Tammy, babe.

17:50.180 --> 17:52.296
Let me put it to you this way.

17:52.660 --> 17:54.730
You give my girls your best shot...

17:54.940 --> 17:57.932
...and I'll give you my best shot.

17:59.580 --> 18:02.378
But I thought you were dating
the desk clerk.

18:02.660 --> 18:05.333
<i>I read it in the Branson Bugle.</i>

18:11.860 --> 18:14.135
Damn you, Dad.

18:14.660 --> 18:18.050
Tammy, the colonel has a better idea.
Why don't you just take me?

18:18.260 --> 18:21.536
I can't dance, sing, or play an
instrument, but how tough can that be?

18:21.740 --> 18:23.571
Besides, I look great in this outfit.

18:23.780 --> 18:25.657
Forget it, forget it. The deal's off.

18:25.860 --> 18:28.328
Oh, Lord, save me
from the wannabes.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.258
Now, you can call us a lot of things.

18:30.460 --> 18:33.577
You can call us worthless, lazy,
sloppy- And that's just the wife.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.974
Right.

18:35.180 --> 18:38.297
But the one thing you can't call us
is wannabes.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.730
We may not be
big country superstars...

18:40.940 --> 18:45.968
...with a big fancy house
or a car that runs or food or...

18:46.180 --> 18:49.217
Oh, my God, we don't have anything.

18:49.780 --> 18:50.895
Not true, son.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.694
Lady, we have something
that you'll never have.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.654
What?
Worse foot odour than Boxcar Willie?

18:58.300 --> 19:00.609
Okay two things.
The odour, of course...

19:00.820 --> 19:04.017
...but more importantly,
the security of knowing...

19:04.220 --> 19:08.611
...that we can never fail
because we never try.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.849
You people are nuttier
than a pecan log at Stuckey's.

19:20.220 --> 19:21.175
Now what do we do?

19:21.380 --> 19:23.496
I suppose you're going
to blame this on me.

19:28.700 --> 19:29.928
Excuse me, folks.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.776
Seeing as how you're no longer
on Miss Wynette's tab...

19:34.980 --> 19:37.335
...how do you propose
to settle this bill?

19:50.700 --> 19:52.975
Great vacation, Peg.

19:53.900 --> 19:56.414
The highlight had to be begging
for gas on the corner...

19:56.620 --> 19:59.009
...of Tony Orlando and Dawn.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.049
Quit complaining.

20:01.260 --> 20:04.491
At least you didn't have to take
a canoe trip with the desk clerk.

20:06.780 --> 20:09.010
By the way, Bud,
I gave him our address.

20:09.220 --> 20:10.812
Well, he said he wanted
to write you.

20:11.020 --> 20:14.615
Well, as soon as someone
learns him his letters.

20:19.140 --> 20:21.608
You know,
I thought it was great vacation.

20:21.820 --> 20:24.892
I mean, we went to Branson
and told off Tammy Wynette.

20:25.100 --> 20:28.615
It's kind of like going to Disneyland
and giving Mickey the finger.

20:29.860 --> 20:31.851
Al.

20:32.060 --> 20:35.291
Get back here.
We're not finished yet.

20:43.140 --> 20:45.608
Yes, we are.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.413
Hi.

20:48.620 --> 20:49.939
What you doing?

20:51.540 --> 20:53.258
Oh, it's...

20:53.460 --> 20:56.816
...just a long, boring story.

20:58.020 --> 21:01.490
Does it end with,
"We're degenerate perverts"?

21:03.380 --> 21:05.098
Oh, so you've heard this one. Bye.

21:07.940 --> 21:10.613
Hey, Mom, Dad, wait up. Wait-

21:10.820 --> 21:12.094
Kelly!
