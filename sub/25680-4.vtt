19:09.315 --> 19:11.735
But how are we gonna get Rory
to come back to the house?

19:11.818 --> 19:13.069
I can impersonate Liam.

19:13.153 --> 19:13.987
-[ding]
<i>-What?</i>

19:14.237 --> 19:16.031
Um, different Liam.

19:17.782 --> 19:19.242
<i>"Different Liam."</i>

19:21.161 --> 19:23.121
I can impersonate...

19:23.204 --> 19:24.456
that guy.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.958
Rodney, I've heard your impersonations.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.293
They're not great. Are you sure you--

19:28.376 --> 19:29.586
[Liam's voice] Rory!

19:29.669 --> 19:31.463
I have something I'd like to run by you.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.173
Got a minute?

19:35.133 --> 19:38.428
Yet his channel is
pulling stuff out of his hair.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.391
Okay, Mr. Squirrel. Let's make a deal.

19:43.475 --> 19:46.478
If you rescue me,

19:46.561 --> 19:49.522
I'll give you a tour of the Vuuugle House.

19:51.608 --> 19:52.734
What's that?

19:52.817 --> 19:56.488
You want $5,000 worth of acorns?

19:56.571 --> 19:58.531
[chuckles] No deal!

19:58.615 --> 20:01.076
Amelia Duckworth will not be swindled!

20:02.952 --> 20:04.412
[imitating Paige] Hi, I'm Paige!

20:04.496 --> 20:06.039
I like sea otters and emotions,

20:06.122 --> 20:07.707
and other people's problems.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.000
[imitating Frankie] Hi, I'm Frankie.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.877
I have glasses and--

20:10.960 --> 20:12.087
Wow.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.214
I really don't spend
a lot of time with Frankie.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.592
Bernie! Bernie, we're losing it, man!

20:17.676 --> 20:20.679
We're never making it
out of this stupid basement!

20:21.846 --> 20:23.223
I'm so weak and...

20:23.306 --> 20:24.349
[breathing heavily]

20:25.517 --> 20:27.060
There's no air, Bernie!

20:27.143 --> 20:28.978
No air!

20:30.063 --> 20:31.231
Of course there's air.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.857
Just turn on the A/C unit.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.777
Wait.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.570
Where does that thing connect to?

20:37.654 --> 20:38.988
The entire house.

20:39.072 --> 20:40.657
That's why the duct is so huge.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.868
I mean, one or even two people our size

20:43.952 --> 20:45.161
could fit inside that thing

20:45.245 --> 20:47.038
and crawl around.

20:47.122 --> 20:49.207
That'd be fun, huh?

20:49.290 --> 20:51.334
Oh, well, back to the puppets.

20:51.626 --> 20:52.585
Bernie!

20:52.669 --> 20:55.046
If we unscrew that thing,

20:55.130 --> 20:57.132
we can climb outta here!

20:59.426 --> 21:00.510
You should have taken the deal

21:00.593 --> 21:02.429
when you had the chance, squirrel!

21:07.100 --> 21:09.102
Guys, you've got
your work cut out for you.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.396
I'm only giving out
one "No way, whoa," today,

21:11.479 --> 21:13.189
and there is a giraffe in Fresno

21:13.273 --> 21:14.607
with a short neck and a long body.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.236
Thank you so much for coming back, Rory.

21:18.319 --> 21:20.196
We have something
we really want to show you.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.201
Alright, we stayed up all night

21:25.285 --> 21:27.787
writing out lyrics and working on
our choreography.

21:27.871 --> 21:29.456
Let's get the biggest "No way"

21:29.539 --> 21:30.665
that's even been "whoa'ed."

21:36.421 --> 21:37.339

21:48.600 --> 21:49.851
We made it!

21:49.934 --> 21:52.479
We're alive!

21:55.523 --> 21:56.816
Um...

21:56.900 --> 21:59.277
this is definitely how I broke my leg.

21:59.361 --> 22:00.403
Not shaving them.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.281
What is going on?

22:03.365 --> 22:05.867
I was locked in the basement

22:05.950 --> 22:08.370
and now I'm free!

22:08.453 --> 22:10.455
Again, thanks for including me.

22:11.706 --> 22:15.835
N-n-n-n no w-w-w-way!

22:15.919 --> 22:16.920
No way! No way!

22:20.548 --> 22:22.509
[together] Five whoa's.

22:24.719 --> 22:27.472
Now this is what I thought the Vuuugle
House was all about.

22:29.224 --> 22:31.351
I want to learn all about
you brave survivors,

22:31.434 --> 22:33.103
and then...

22:33.186 --> 22:34.896
I wanna tell the world all about you.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.149
-But we did all this--
-It's okay.

22:38.233 --> 22:40.276
We fixed it. If it's good for the house,

22:40.360 --> 22:41.444
it's good for all of us.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.155
Rory Finch is here?

22:44.239 --> 22:47.409
Guys, did you know Rory Finch is here?

22:47.492 --> 22:48.535
How do I look?

22:49.536 --> 22:50.578
[all] Great.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.709
Guys! Crutches.

22:55.792 --> 22:56.835
Ah, I'll catch up.

23:00.505 --> 23:02.465
We're here with Amelia and Bernie

23:02.549 --> 23:05.051
who spent two days trapped in a basement.

23:05.135 --> 23:07.262
Tell us. What happened down there?

23:07.345 --> 23:09.305
It was crazy.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.349
There was no Wi-Fi!

23:12.392 --> 23:14.477
And Bernie made a sock puppet show.

23:14.561 --> 23:15.979
A puppet show?

23:16.062 --> 23:17.063
I love it!

23:17.147 --> 23:18.273
Uh, can you show us a little?

23:18.356 --> 23:19.357
Sorry.

23:19.441 --> 23:20.608
Didn't bring any of my puppets.

23:21.651 --> 23:22.694
It's okay!

23:22.777 --> 23:24.029
I made one of my own.

[imitating Bernie]
Hey, hey, it's Bernie Socks!

23:27.198 --> 23:29.284
I like to get my swole on,

23:29.367 --> 23:31.244
so I can get yoked!

23:31.327 --> 23:32.537
Also, I'm cheap.

23:33.538 --> 23:34.581
Coo-coo.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.501
That was pretty good.
