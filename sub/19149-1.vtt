Spiraling Sphere

01:36.240 --> 01:38.200
It's important to keep your guard up.

01:38.200 --> 01:42.090
When fighting a Puppet user, don't get fooled by the main body.

01:42.090 --> 01:45.170
You need to look for the chakra strings.

01:45.170 --> 01:48.150
Why didn't you use the chakra blade, Naruto?

01:52.150 --> 01:56.590
If you let your chakra flow into the blade, and sever the chakra strings, it'll render the main body immobile.

01:56.590 --> 01:59.740
We told you that, didn't we?

01:59.740 --> 02:01.960
I know that already...

02:02.380 --> 02:06.850
But anyway, where did that Puppet Master, Mukade, disappear to?

02:13.860 --> 02:15.330
What's this hole?

02:15.750 --> 02:20.070
Mukade's aim is to get the Ryuumyaku from the ruins of Rouran.

02:20.070 --> 02:21.330
Ryuumyaku?

02:21.850 --> 02:25.160
It's a source of massive chakra flowing underground.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.310
Basically, it's like an infinite amount of chakra sleeping underneath.

02:33.190 --> 02:38.290
Yamato, take the team of Naruto, Sakura, and Sai

02:38.290 --> 02:41.680
and head towards the ruins of Rouran, in the desert of the Hidden Village of the Wind.

02:43.880 --> 02:48.170
For the treaty between us and the Sand Village, capture the rogue ninja, Mukade.

02:49.910 --> 02:50.860
Is that it?

02:56.650 --> 03:01.670
Mukade's aim is the dormant Ryuumyaku hidden within Rouran.

03:01.670 --> 03:08.090
The Ryuumyaku is an incredible source of energy, so the Fourth Hokage sealed it with his jutsu.

03:10.210 --> 03:14.190
Your job is to renew that seal!

03:15.430 --> 03:18.730
That's the Fourth Hokage's sealing jutsu.

03:20.610 --> 03:21.420
Who's there?

03:26.150 --> 03:29.850
Looks like you guys were a bit too late.

03:30.400 --> 03:35.410
I'll absorb the power of the Ryuumyaku into my Puppet Master Jutsu.

03:35.410 --> 03:40.400
I shall be able to rule not only the five nations but also the world!

03:40.400 --> 03:42.050
That's impossible.

03:42.050 --> 03:46.980
You don't know how to undo the Fourth Hokage's seal.

03:46.980 --> 03:49.650
I know that already.

03:50.430 --> 03:51.320
What are you trying to do?

03:51.680 --> 03:54.170
I'll just absorb the seal itself!

03:54.170 --> 03:57.090
On, Mayuragiranti, Sowaka...

03:58.980 --> 03:59.550
Damn it!

04:05.260 --> 04:05.990
Oh no!

04:12.610 --> 04:13.690
Stop!

Captain Yamato!

04:47.970 --> 04:50.290
Naruto!

04:56.930 --> 05:03.190
The light rising above the tower

05:04.620 --> 05:10.050
Thoughts boil and run high.

05:11.080 --> 05:18.550
Dragon path to be protected

05:18.550 --> 05:22.130
Pierce with a shining blade.

05:22.130 --> 05:26.080
Look to the sky.

05:26.970 --> 05:34.140
Sand, wind may rage proud, blossoming...

05:34.140 --> 05:41.920
...bright sun dance in flowers and never will it die.

05:42.770 --> 05:46.400
The light flowing in spirals...

05:46.400 --> 05:46.810
Hey...

05:47.890 --> 05:48.780
Where is this place?

05:51.240 --> 05:53.330
Ah! Wait!

06:15.430 --> 06:16.190
What was that?

06:20.030 --> 06:21.890
Wait...

06:47.590 --> 06:48.370
What the...

06:55.230 --> 06:56.420
This place is...

07:12.010 --> 07:14.890
Awesome!

07:16.570 --> 07:18.620
Way tall!

07:37.830 --> 07:39.220
What are t-they?

07:41.740 --> 07:42.870
(影分身の—)
Kage Bunshin no Ju—
Shadow Clone Tech—

07:51.590 --> 07:52.900
They're puppets!

07:54.740 --> 07:56.290
Damn Mukade!

07:56.290 --> 07:57.330
Where are you?!

08:02.250 --> 08:04.260
Damn it, what's going on?

08:08.220 --> 08:09.410
What?!

08:09.880 --> 08:11.720
How many of them are there?

08:18.050 --> 08:18.970
Damn it!

08:28.710 --> 08:30.120
They're persistent!

08:30.740 --> 08:33.450
Naruto, why did you not use the chakra blade?

08:34.270 --> 08:35.280
Right!

08:35.280 --> 08:36.010
The chakra blade!

08:51.650 --> 08:53.180
Damn it.

08:53.180 --> 08:58.140
I can't take them on even with a chakra blade if they keep coming like this!

09:29.410 --> 09:30.100
Not again...

09:42.150 --> 09:44.130

10:00.900 --> 10:03.250
What's with those puppets?

10:03.250 --> 10:06.110
They seem to have been supercharged by the Ryuumyaku.

10:07.510 --> 10:09.240
So who are you?

10:10.860 --> 10:11.210
You are...

10:11.780 --> 10:13.160
...a Leaf ninja, right?

10:14.420 --> 10:15.810
We're also Leaf ninja.

10:18.140 --> 10:20.200
You need to get that treated quick.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.750
He's really something....

10:35.740 --> 10:37.540
to have survived my Puppet Ninja Force.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.070
This should help.

10:49.860 --> 10:52.780
Hey, who are you guys anyway?

10:52.780 --> 10:54.880
We can't answer that question.

10:54.880 --> 10:55.650
What?!

10:55.650 --> 10:57.560
Then, where is this place?

10:58.890 --> 10:59.790
This is Rouran.

10:59.790 --> 11:00.980
Huh?!

11:00.980 --> 11:02.760
That's impossible!

11:03.340 --> 11:05.730
We have no time to go into the details.

11:06.370 --> 11:10.690
Could you stay away from this city while we continue our mission?

11:12.350 --> 11:16.100
We could possibly tell you something after the mission is completed.

11:17.790 --> 11:21.100
Look! Turn left at that corner and you can leave through that door.

11:21.460 --> 11:22.080
Huh?

11:22.860 --> 11:25.030
It's a promise, okay?

11:25.030 --> 11:25.850
Hey...

11:30.180 --> 11:31.900
What's going on?

11:31.900 --> 11:34.020
Even if he says that...

11:34.560 --> 11:35.380
Right!

11:37.610 --> 11:39.000
Where is everybody?

11:56.110 --> 11:56.790
Ouch...

12:00.670 --> 12:03.570
But this is amazing.

12:07.220 --> 12:10.550
Is this really Rouran?

12:13.990 --> 12:18.170
Rouran was surrounded by desert.

12:19.450 --> 12:20.870
At that point, I...

12:27.690 --> 12:30.240
Right, I have to find the others.

12:31.240 --> 12:31.660
Huh?

12:32.310 --> 12:33.700
Queen!

12:36.620 --> 12:38.560
Queen!

12:40.990 --> 12:43.350
Queen!

12:52.870 --> 12:54.180
Queen?

13:06.230 --> 13:07.010
Mother...

13:09.530 --> 13:15.350
The light rising above the tower...

13:15.940 --> 13:19.410
proud, blossoming, bright sun...

13:19.410 --> 13:23.680
dance with flowers and never die.

13:27.060 --> 13:27.930
Sara...

13:28.590 --> 13:30.830
Someday you will have to sing this song...

13:31.490 --> 13:36.040
...for the sake of the people's happiness and peace.

13:36.770 --> 13:37.790
Yes.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.490
Come. Sing with me.

13:41.490 --> 13:43.250
Yes, Mother.

13:44.540 --> 13:51.230
The light flowing in spirals

13:51.720 --> 13:56.750
To the garden where the dragon's claw ends...

13:59.330 --> 14:02.040
Sara-sama, what are you doing?

14:03.100 --> 14:06.530
The people are waiting to sing their praises of you.

14:06.950 --> 14:12.990
Please show your smile to the people who are here to praise you and

14:12.990 --> 14:16.830
your mother for building this beautiful city of Rouran.

14:16.830 --> 14:21.070
You have to lead the people in place of your mother.

14:24.870 --> 14:26.650
Okay, Anrokuzan.

14:37.590 --> 14:39.840
Queen!

14:41.560 --> 14:43.090
Queen Sara!

14:59.830 --> 15:01.330
She's the Queen?!

15:04.410 --> 15:06.760
Queen Sara!

15:09.100 --> 15:11.920
She might know something!

15:30.600 --> 15:31.330
Phew...

15:34.980 --> 15:36.740
You're safe now.

15:36.740 --> 15:39.620
Ahhh! Let go of me!

15:41.240 --> 15:42.620
You insolent boy!

15:43.200 --> 15:45.170
What the hell was that for?!

15:45.170 --> 15:48.120
I saved you, you know!

15:48.910 --> 15:49.750
Huh?

15:49.750 --> 15:51.750
I have to thank you first.

15:51.750 --> 15:52.420
Thank you.

15:52.820 --> 15:54.380
What's with this girl?

15:54.860 --> 15:56.350
What a ruffian!

15:56.960 --> 15:59.540
Are you the Queen?

15:59.540 --> 16:02.810
I am the Queen of Rouran, Sara.

16:02.810 --> 16:04.030
Rouran?

16:04.030 --> 16:06.500
Ah, my name is Uzumaki Naruto!

16:06.500 --> 16:08.270
A ninja of the Leaf Village.

16:08.530 --> 16:11.630
So this place is also called Rouran?

16:11.630 --> 16:15.040
The Rouran I was at just now was a run down rui—

16:15.040 --> 16:17.040
What nonsense are you talking about?

16:17.040 --> 16:21.360
Rouran is more precious than my life that I inherited from my mother.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.320
I really have no idea of what's going on here.

16:26.900 --> 16:28.310
Speaking of which,

16:28.310 --> 16:30.300
how'd you fall from that tower?

16:34.710 --> 16:36.690
It felt like someone pushed me from behind.

16:36.690 --> 16:37.650
Huh?

16:37.650 --> 16:40.400
Is someone trying to kill you?

16:40.740 --> 16:41.810
That can't be!

16:41.810 --> 16:44.340
There is no one trying to kill me!

16:44.950 --> 16:46.330
You saw it too, right?

16:46.330 --> 16:48.650
The people who came were welcoming me so passionately!

16:50.050 --> 16:52.420
But you were pushed from behind, right?

16:53.890 --> 16:54.450
That's...

16:55.020 --> 16:56.880
probably just me being mistaken!

16:58.070 --> 16:58.700
Huh?!

16:59.120 --> 17:00.880
You didn't keep your promise.

17:01.930 --> 17:03.170
I don't have a choice!

17:03.170 --> 17:05.710
She fell off the tower right in front of me!

17:05.710 --> 17:06.500
Wait a minute!

17:06.500 --> 17:07.829
Who are you people?

17:08.240 --> 17:12.430
Don't tell me you guys are after her life, too?

17:13.130 --> 17:15.020
Don't be mistaken.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.349
We're supposed to protect the Queen.

17:23.190 --> 17:25.280
Puppets attacking out of no where...

17:25.819 --> 17:29.240
...and the ruins of Rouran becoming a great city like this.

17:29.930 --> 17:32.710
I totally don't get what the hell is going on.

17:33.150 --> 17:36.610
If you guys know something, please tell me!

17:48.420 --> 17:50.890
Ramen at half price on opening day today?

17:50.890 --> 17:52.190
It just opened today.

17:52.190 --> 17:53.990
The ramen is very good!

18:07.900 --> 18:09.200
Oh man!

18:09.200 --> 18:09.980
Yo!

18:10.410 --> 18:11.840
Jiraya-sensei!

18:11.840 --> 18:14.000
Hey! Hey!

18:21.510 --> 18:22.630
Look...

18:22.630 --> 18:24.320
...and be amazed!

18:28.580 --> 18:29.960
What do you think?

18:29.960 --> 18:33.390
The secret technique that you spent three years completing!

18:33.390 --> 18:34.840
I've already mastered it!

18:34.840 --> 18:36.000
Amazing, right?!

18:36.000 --> 18:37.210
That's amazing!

18:37.210 --> 18:38.900
As expected, Jiraya-sensei!

18:40.080 --> 18:41.360
You said it!

18:41.580 --> 18:43.520
Well, I'll be on my way then.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.310
Huh?

18:48.460 --> 18:49.140
Oh?

18:56.820 --> 18:59.280
I want to eat ramen now!

18:59.280 --> 19:01.170
Teuchi-san's noodles of sweat!

19:01.170 --> 19:02.740
Soul Soup!

19:02.740 --> 19:05.780
Let me savour it with all my heart!

19:06.910 --> 19:09.770
The Will of Fire transmits the special flavour well...

19:09.770 --> 19:11.130
Oh man!

19:11.510 --> 19:14.970
How easy it is for you guys to be impressed just by ramen!

19:15.840 --> 19:17.040
What?!

19:17.040 --> 19:18.230
Hatake Kakashi!

19:18.230 --> 19:19.140
You're lining up too, aren't yo—

19:19.140 --> 19:19.670
Minato-sensei!
You're lining up too, aren't yo—

19:19.670 --> 19:20.200
Minato-sensei!

19:21.650 --> 19:22.780
A mission?

19:22.780 --> 19:25.100
Yeah. Get everyone together.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.470
Hey, what about Tuechi-san's ramen!

19:29.340 --> 19:32.280
Well, I am not as free as you lot.

19:33.510 --> 19:35.850
What a jerk!

19:35.850 --> 19:37.150
No doubt.

19:39.530 --> 19:42.610
The mission briefing is as mentioned.

19:42.610 --> 19:47.800
Namikaze Minato, Akimichi Choza, and Aburame Shibi...

19:47.800 --> 19:50.550
...head for Rouran right away.

19:51.210 --> 19:52.110
I understand.

19:53.230 --> 19:54.750
Third Hokage.

19:55.530 --> 20:00.600
I want to add Hatake Kakashi to this mission...

20:03.060 --> 20:05.550
You have a plan in mind?

20:05.920 --> 20:06.540
Yes.

20:06.890 --> 20:10.220
He is young, but a very talented ninja.

20:11.140 --> 20:12.190
Okay then.

20:23.660 --> 20:24.940
That's Rouran.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.670
Minato-sensei, what should I do?

20:29.500 --> 20:32.120
I have a task for you.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.360
You will do it, right?

20:33.850 --> 20:34.610
Yes!

20:34.610 --> 20:35.330
I will do my best!

20:46.400 --> 20:48.480
No choice then.

20:48.480 --> 20:52.520
I didn't want to talk, but I shall explain it as well as I can.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.980
We are here on a top secret mission from the Hidden Leaf.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.200
Time traveler...

20:58.200 --> 21:00.050
...this is indeed not the Rouran that you know.

21:00.420 --> 21:01.930
If I am right,

21:02.370 --> 21:04.600
you must be from the future.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.820
The future?

21:05.820 --> 21:06.910
The future?!

21:06.910 --> 21:12.820
Yes. I kept you in the dark mainly not to interfere with flow of time.

21:12.820 --> 21:15.800
It'd change drastically if people from the future get involved in this era.

21:16.240 --> 21:19.830
This is most likely twenty years before your time.

21:20.590 --> 21:23.800
There was a ninja who came from the future six years ago.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.500
He came suddenly like you.

21:27.230 --> 21:28.690
His name is Mukade.

21:28.690 --> 21:29.360
Huh?!

21:29.910 --> 21:32.760
The guy we were after is called Mukade too!

21:32.760 --> 21:34.530
Ahhhh!

21:34.530 --> 21:36.700
Now I really don't get what the hell is going on!

21:36.700 --> 21:39.240
Could you tell me what happened to you?

21:39.790 --> 21:41.590
We might be able to help.

21:43.570 --> 21:47.500
We chased Mukade to the Ryuumyaku.

21:48.370 --> 21:53.040
When we got there, he absorbed the seal.

21:55.060 --> 21:55.940
And then...

21:56.720 --> 22:02.390
So you and Mukade came from the future using space-time ninjutsu.

22:02.390 --> 22:07.260
I'm not sure, but does this mean that I can't go back?

22:08.720 --> 22:14.500
 Since Mukade absorbed the seal into him, you should defeat him.

22:14.500 --> 22:18.440
Then, time should return to normal and you should be able to return to the future.

22:18.440 --> 22:19.350
Really?!

22:19.630 --> 22:22.900
In any case, if Mukade is not defeated as soon as possible,

22:22.900 --> 22:25.030
history will change further.

22:25.030 --> 22:26.940
I remember!

22:27.340 --> 22:30.550
I thought I saw your face somewhere...

22:31.590 --> 22:34.030
His face is the same as the Fourth Hokage carved in stone!

22:34.670 --> 22:36.270
That must be a joke.

22:36.660 --> 22:39.440
Our Hokage is still the 3rd one.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.760
But this boy is from the future, right?

22:42.760 --> 22:45.040
Let's stop talking about the future.

22:45.040 --> 22:48.410
History will change further with us knowing needless things.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.010
Huh?!

22:49.440 --> 22:52.280
The power of the Ryuumyaku sleeps beneath Rouran...

22:52.830 --> 22:56.720
...so Mukade must be using it to develop his puppets.

22:59.070 --> 23:03.260
<i>I'll absorb the power of the Ryuumyaku into my Puppet Master Jutsu.</i>

23:03.960 --> 23:08.890
<i>I shall be able to rule not only the five nations but also the world!</i>

23:08.890 --> 23:10.860
Speaking of that, Mukade did say something lik—

23:10.860 --> 23:11.860
Silence!

23:13.320 --> 23:15.990
Enough lies from all of you!

23:15.990 --> 23:20.540
It wasn't a ninja called Mukada whom appeared in this city six years ago,

23:20.540 --> 23:22.580
but a great man named Anrokuzan.

23:23.580 --> 23:29.050
Anrokuzan is now working as a minister for the good of this city, in the spirit of my mother.

23:29.510 --> 23:34.870
I can't imagine a peace loving man like him developing weapons.

23:34.870 --> 23:40.030
Your majesty, I'm afraid you're being deceived by that man.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.510
I don't beleive you!

23:43.510 --> 23:45.880
All of you are more suspicious than he is!

23:47.280 --> 23:48.990
Hey, where are you going?

23:50.400 --> 23:52.740
I'll go and ask him myself!

23:53.150 --> 23:56.080
Someone is after your life, right?

23:56.080 --> 23:59.930
It might be A-Ankoro... Mukade's doing, you know!

24:00.920 --> 24:02.450
Let's split up.

24:02.450 --> 24:05.120
You protect her majesty.

24:06.050 --> 24:10.980
I can protect Sara, but I also have to capture Mukade.

24:11.340 --> 24:15.550
It's because we let him escape that things are in a mess now.

24:15.550 --> 24:19.150
It's best that I look for him since I know this place well.

24:19.150 --> 24:22.850
Furthermore, I can't add you to my team in the middle of the mission.

24:23.340 --> 24:25.660
You should understand that being a Leaf ninja, right?

24:26.160 --> 24:28.710
It is important to protect Sara's life, too.

24:29.830 --> 24:32.900
Argh, I get it already!

24:32.900 --> 24:35.360
I can't leave Sara alone either.

24:35.360 --> 24:35.830
Huh?

24:36.640 --> 24:37.300
Take this.

24:39.330 --> 24:40.260
Huh?!

24:41.200 --> 24:43.500
I think I've seen this before.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.110
This is my specially made kunai.

24:46.110 --> 24:49.950
I'll be able to get to you no matter where you are with this.

24:50.760 --> 24:53.150
The seal on this kunai...

24:53.150 --> 24:55.060
Which means he's really...

24:55.060 --> 24:56.370
Hey, dude...

24:56.370 --> 24:57.540
Hurry and go!

24:57.540 --> 24:59.120
We don't have a minute to lose!

25:00.130 --> 25:01.810
I get it already.

25:02.550 --> 25:04.680
I am counting on you to protect Sara.

25:21.550 --> 25:25.700
Naruto and that ninja don't know anything about Anrokuzan.

25:25.700 --> 25:28.620
How dare they say such things about him!

25:32.620 --> 25:34.470
Where'd she go?!

25:43.880 --> 25:47.600
I shall prove Anrokuzan's innocence!

26:00.550 --> 26:02.090
These people...

26:03.820 --> 26:07.480
So there really is someone after my life.

26:09.470 --> 26:12.450
Are you the real Sara-sama?

26:13.170 --> 26:15.760
I am Queen Sara!

26:15.760 --> 26:19.520
If you want my life, try taking it without sneaking around!

26:21.990 --> 26:23.290
Return it to us.

26:23.290 --> 26:23.720
Huh?

26:24.330 --> 26:25.690
"Return it"?

26:25.690 --> 26:28.910
If not, we don't know what we will do!

26:28.910 --> 26:31.660
Return it! Return it!

26:31.660 --> 26:32.850
All of us are serious!

26:35.920 --> 26:37.020
Sara!

26:37.020 --> 26:38.480
Get away from Sara!

26:39.340 --> 26:40.400
Help!

26:40.400 --> 26:41.740
Spare my life!

26:42.100 --> 26:42.790
Huh?!

26:46.990 --> 26:49.100
What? You guys are all...

26:52.180 --> 26:54.200
I am Sarai.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.000
I am one of the bad guys!

26:56.470 --> 26:58.180
I'm sorry.

26:58.180 --> 26:59.730
My name is Masakoto.

26:59.730 --> 27:04.640
We have a favor to ask of Sara-sama.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.190
What is this about?

27:06.580 --> 27:10.170
What do you want me to return to you?

27:32.930 --> 27:34.190
It's beautiful.

27:34.190 --> 27:34.680
Huh?!

27:35.520 --> 27:39.130
The parade seen from here is much more beautiful.

27:39.130 --> 27:40.930
Oh man...

27:41.170 --> 27:44.350
This parade was started by Anrokuzan.

27:45.280 --> 27:50.070
It was to cheer me and the people up from my mother's sudden death.

27:51.020 --> 27:53.040
That's strange.

27:53.920 --> 27:55.500
What's strange?

27:56.150 --> 28:00.830
Everyone makes fun of Sara-sama, calling you a puppet princess.

28:02.250 --> 28:03.480
Puppet princess...

28:03.480 --> 28:04.610
Stupid!

28:04.610 --> 28:06.060
Shut your mouth!

28:06.060 --> 28:07.060
Sorry!

28:07.830 --> 28:10.400
I am sorry, your majesty.

28:10.400 --> 28:13.640
But there is some truth in what Sarai said.

28:13.970 --> 28:20.480
Everyone had their family taken away one morning, being told it was Sara-sama's command.

28:20.950 --> 28:21.780
Really?

28:21.780 --> 28:22.970
That's a lie!

28:22.970 --> 28:25.120
I never gave such a command!

28:25.120 --> 28:27.060
It's true!

28:27.060 --> 28:31.370
My father and big brother were taken away.

28:31.370 --> 28:36.740
There are rumors that there are weapons being made in this country for war.

28:36.740 --> 28:41.090
So everyone is here to beg Sara-sama directly.

28:41.090 --> 28:44.160
It's the same as the masked guy said.

28:44.160 --> 28:45.830
That's a lie!

28:45.830 --> 28:51.370
Then why do so many of the people welcome me so passionately?

28:52.040 --> 28:55.270
There is no one happy.

28:55.270 --> 28:56.910
What are you saying?

28:56.910 --> 28:59.630
There are so many people enjoying themselves!

29:31.580 --> 29:33.560
Look, it's a puppet...

29:34.680 --> 29:35.820
They're all...

29:35.820 --> 29:37.950
...puppets!

29:40.740 --> 29:41.480
Sara!

29:43.280 --> 29:45.030
Look closely, alright?

29:56.270 --> 29:58.980
Chakra strings are coming out from that pipe.

29:59.540 --> 30:03.800
The power of the Ryuumyaku feeding the city is flowing in that pipe.

30:06.140 --> 30:10.510
That pipe is feeding Chakra to the puppets.

30:33.180 --> 30:34.010
What's...

30:34.940 --> 30:35.960
...that?

30:36.530 --> 30:40.390
Mukade wants to make you a puppet, too!

30:43.030 --> 30:44.180
No!

30:44.180 --> 30:45.490
That's a lie!

30:45.490 --> 30:47.950
Anrokuzan would never do that!

30:47.950 --> 30:50.420
Hey, Sara!

30:54.590 --> 30:55.870
Where are you going!

30:57.160 --> 30:58.290
Wait!

31:00.170 --> 31:01.400
Sara!

31:08.210 --> 31:10.690
Where did she go?

31:13.050 --> 31:19.700
Dragon path to be protected...

31:19.700 --> 31:23.320
That's the song you sang when we first met.

31:26.890 --> 31:30.740
It's a song that my mother always sang.

31:32.190 --> 31:38.040
It's Anrokuzan who persuaded my mother to use the power of the Ryuumyaku for the sake of the people.

31:41.320 --> 31:46.440
With my mothers control of the power of the Ryuumyaku and Anrokuzan's technology,

31:46.440 --> 31:50.440
Rouran grew into a city with thousand towers in no time.

31:56.810 --> 32:02.470
But Mother died in the middle of fulfilling her wish.

32:06.880 --> 32:11.510
Anrokuzan was the only one with me by my side when she died.

32:12.490 --> 32:14.980
There was no one else.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.130
I have no parents either.

32:17.910 --> 32:20.460
But I have a master called Ero-sennin.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.210
Though he's dead now.

32:24.630 --> 32:27.810
But I learned many important things from him.

32:28.420 --> 32:31.040
My ninja way together with my strong will is...

32:31.040 --> 32:33.930
...also inherited from my master.

32:34.780 --> 32:38.010
You got something important from your mother, too, right?

32:38.430 --> 32:39.150
Yes.

32:39.950 --> 32:44.010
Then think about what your mother valued.

32:44.010 --> 32:46.850
You should then know what to do now.

32:46.850 --> 32:50.310
Do what you have to!

32:51.340 --> 32:56.300
And don't bend over, no-matter what!{TLC}

33:09.160 --> 33:13.010
I must first find out the truth about this city.

33:15.470 --> 33:16.720
The Queens have...

33:16.720 --> 33:19.790
...the ability to sense the flow of the Ryuumyaku.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.720
If I can confirm where the Ryuumyaku of that pipe is connected to, then...

33:22.720 --> 33:23.540
Alright!

33:35.900 --> 33:40.800
This exhaust pipe is the relay point transmitting the Ryumraku flow.

33:41.300 --> 33:44.660
If we find your family, we'll definitely rescue them.

33:44.660 --> 33:47.140
So, please wait here with your friends.

33:47.140 --> 33:48.250
Really?

33:48.620 --> 33:51.670
I swear on my honor as Queen!

33:52.680 --> 33:54.190
Let's go back.

33:55.020 --> 33:56.640
It's a promise, okay?

33:56.640 --> 33:58.330
Leave it to us!

34:02.970 --> 34:03.660
Let's go.

34:04.100 --> 34:04.650
All right.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.440
This is...

35:26.930 --> 35:28.110
Puppet soldiers!

35:28.550 --> 35:29.890
I can't believe it!

35:30.280 --> 35:34.640
Anrokuzan kidnapped the citizens to create these soldiers.

35:36.630 --> 35:37.500
What should we do?

35:37.940 --> 35:40.400
We need to stop this immediately.

35:55.380 --> 35:57.660
Take me there.

35:57.660 --> 35:59.700
Hurry, please.

36:00.100 --> 36:03.720
The Ryuumyaku can be stopped from there.

36:04.480 --> 36:07.960
Alright, hold on tight!

36:36.090 --> 36:37.420
Please stand back.

36:49.620 --> 36:57.440
This is an order from the Queen, stop and control the flow of the Ryuumyaku.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.590
Kyuu Kyuu Noritsuyo {her chanting,have no idea what it is. We may put: Fuck me, fuck me harder.lol}

37:32.410 --> 37:34.210
This should do it.

37:34.210 --> 37:38.950
I've completely stopped the flow of the Ryuumyaku directed to the factory.

37:38.950 --> 37:40.910
Great.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.450
Come on, let's get out of here.

37:54.050 --> 37:58.140
What are you doing there, my Queen?

38:02.590 --> 38:03.840
Anrokuzan!

38:03.840 --> 38:04.830
Huh?!

38:05.660 --> 38:07.210
He's Anrokuzan?!

38:10.100 --> 38:12.280
I have stopped the flow of the Ryuumyaku!

38:12.280 --> 38:15.580
I will not allow you to use this power for war!

38:17.480 --> 38:19.280
I command you as the Queen...

38:19.520 --> 38:25.400
...stop the production of the puppet weapons and release the people on forced labor right this instant!

38:26.240 --> 38:29.690
Oh, so you found out.

38:30.350 --> 38:33.500
Which means, I can't let you live then.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.750
A puppet will be enough to replace you,

38:38.750 --> 38:42.150
since the puppet army is already finished.

38:42.150 --> 38:46.310
I no longer need you to control the Ryuumyaku.

38:52.370 --> 38:53.550
Sara.

38:53.550 --> 38:55.060
Take everyone and run!

38:55.060 --> 38:55.670
Huh?!

38:56.420 --> 38:58.310
I'll capture him!

38:58.950 --> 39:00.340
Go, quick!

39:00.780 --> 39:01.410
Okay.

39:02.800 --> 39:05.490
Are you really Mukade?

39:05.490 --> 39:07.150
You grew into quite a pig!

39:08.450 --> 39:12.500
You, Leaf ninja, told the Queen some useless information.

39:13.460 --> 39:15.870
It's been six years since we last met, eh?

39:15.870 --> 39:19.200
For me it was just like yesterday!

39:19.200 --> 39:21.920
I don't care if you grew fat.

39:21.920 --> 39:23.870
but if you are Mukade, then I will not spare you!

39:26.520 --> 39:27.890
Mukade, you say?

39:27.890 --> 39:30.590
I had forgotten that roughneck's name.

39:32.620 --> 39:38.600
I am the minister of Rouran, Lord Anrokuzan!

39:38.600 --> 39:40.440
What "Lord"?!

39:59.970 --> 40:03.840
I told you I've finished the puppet army.

40:04.630 --> 40:05.910
I'll open up a path!

40:05.910 --> 40:07.960
Run as fast as you can!

40:07.960 --> 40:08.500
Okay.

40:09.090 --> 40:10.570
(影分身の術)
Kage Bunshin no Jutsu
Shadow Clone Technique

40:24.710 --> 40:26.060
Now! Run!

40:26.350 --> 40:26.990
All right!

40:33.660 --> 40:34.910
What's this about?

41:05.460 --> 41:06.330
Naruto...

41:11.110 --> 41:12.250
You can't get out.

41:12.620 --> 41:14.400
You can't use or feel your strength, I assume?

41:15.020 --> 41:19.410
That's because that puppet is draining your chakra.

41:19.410 --> 41:21.200
Stop it, Anrokuzan!

41:24.410 --> 41:27.890
I give you my eternal thanks, Sara-sama.

41:28.710 --> 41:30.680
You've helped to fulfill my great ambition...

41:30.970 --> 41:36.170
...in place of your dead mother.

41:36.730 --> 41:40.360
But you are of no use to me now.

41:40.360 --> 41:44.270
Die like your mother.

41:46.270 --> 41:49.740
You... killed... my mother?!

41:52.340 --> 41:55.160
You finally figured it out.

41:55.450 --> 41:58.640
Your mother was a cunning Queen.

41:58.640 --> 42:03.670
She saw through me and refused to assist me.

42:19.340 --> 42:22.540
You are a great puppet.

42:22.540 --> 42:26.440
Just like one of mine.

42:32.640 --> 42:36.870
But, it's time to replace you with a real puppet.

42:52.380 --> 42:53.820
Mukade!

42:53.820 --> 42:56.640
Your enemy is me!

42:57.130 --> 42:59.510
Sara, hang in there!

43:01.900 --> 43:02.600
You are...

43:03.270 --> 43:06.030
You are not a puppet!

43:33.370 --> 43:36.060
What is this tremendous amount of chakra?!

43:37.130 --> 43:40.040
This is no time to be crying!

43:40.040 --> 43:41.520
Do what...

43:41.870 --> 43:43.980
...you have to!

43:44.500 --> 43:47.940
I'll beat him up for you!

43:58.350 --> 44:00.830
What can you do now?

44:00.830 --> 44:02.280
You can do nothing!

44:15.680 --> 44:17.460
You fool!

44:35.340 --> 44:38.360
I am invincible.

45:07.190 --> 45:10.630
Look, this is my ultimate body!

45:11.680 --> 45:14.110
What is that thing?

45:19.070 --> 45:21.460
Die here with Sara!

45:39.810 --> 45:41.130
It's useless to run!

45:45.580 --> 45:47.000
Damn it!

46:08.020 --> 46:09.160
Are you all right?

46:11.970 --> 46:12.830
What?

46:13.350 --> 46:15.060
You did well.

46:21.520 --> 46:22.360
Explode!

46:25.550 --> 46:27.040
Protect the Queen now!

46:28.100 --> 46:29.880
Sara, go quick!

46:29.880 --> 46:31.810
Take everyone to the surface!

46:33.240 --> 46:34.050
Right.

46:39.860 --> 46:40.820
Alright!

46:40.820 --> 46:43.280
Sara, you are not getting away!

46:44.730 --> 46:46.060
Rasengan!

46:58.720 --> 47:00.810
Everyone! Let's run!

47:02.210 --> 47:03.800
It's dangerous in here!

47:05.110 --> 47:07.820
Come, remove your chains quickly.

47:08.290 --> 47:10.280
Please follow me.

47:10.930 --> 47:14.190
Your families are waiting for you on the surface.

47:14.190 --> 47:16.030
Come, this way.

47:30.740 --> 47:32.740
You can still move?

47:32.740 --> 47:34.630
Don't let your guard down.

47:34.630 --> 47:36.830
We still don't know the limits of his power.

47:41.640 --> 47:44.790
Do you think you can beat me like this.

48:05.940 --> 48:09.530
I told you I am invincible.

48:09.530 --> 48:10.640

Did we get him?

49:27.820 --> 49:29.300
Still?

49:34.540 --> 49:41.760
Allow me to show you the ultimate power of the puppet weapon.

49:48.130 --> 49:50.790
A new body for me!

49:55.870 --> 49:56.710
What?

50:21.210 --> 50:22.950
Father! Nii-chan!

50:22.950 --> 50:24.250
Honey!

50:26.370 --> 50:28.000
Sarai.

50:28.000 --> 50:28.870
Oh.

50:32.340 --> 50:33.870
Thank you!

50:33.870 --> 50:37.320
Sara-sama, you kept your promise!

50:42.270 --> 50:43.270
Everyone!

50:43.270 --> 50:44.750
Move away from here quick!

50:44.750 --> 50:45.930
It's dangerous!

50:46.590 --> 50:47.350
Okay!

50:55.660 --> 50:56.940
Bastard!

50:56.940 --> 50:58.440
I will never let go!

50:58.710 --> 50:59.570
Naruto!

51:00.680 --> 51:03.340
Sara, we will take care of things here,

51:03.340 --> 51:05.390
so take everyone and run!

51:05.390 --> 51:06.120
But...

51:06.120 --> 51:08.420
You have to protect everyone!

51:08.420 --> 51:09.430
You are the Queen!

51:12.120 --> 51:13.390
I understand.

51:21.050 --> 51:22.000
That's right...

51:22.310 --> 51:24.960
Everyone, follow me.

51:24.960 --> 51:26.400
Where are we going?

51:26.870 --> 51:28.610
Let's go to the central tower.

51:28.610 --> 51:30.430
Huh? Why?

51:32.580 --> 51:34.050
Father, Nii-chan...

51:34.050 --> 51:34.830
...let's go.

51:35.440 --> 51:38.080
Please! Trust me!

51:38.400 --> 51:41.550
Everyone, let's trust the Queen!

51:44.780 --> 51:45.850
All right.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.980
Come, this way!

51:54.840 --> 51:57.230
Your opponent is me!

51:57.230 --> 52:00.380
Don't interfere, Leaf brat!

52:13.980 --> 52:17.860
Why is Mukade so hung up on going after Sara?

52:19.330 --> 52:21.940
There must be a special reason for that.

52:22.630 --> 52:25.950
Naruto, protect Sara-sama for a while more!

52:25.950 --> 52:26.630
Huh?

52:27.250 --> 52:28.950
We have something we need to do!

52:30.000 --> 52:31.100
Leave it to me!

52:31.590 --> 52:32.610
Counting on you.

52:32.610 --> 52:33.530
You bet!

52:36.000 --> 52:41.030
Why am I obeying him without hesitation, I wonder?

52:41.030 --> 52:42.650
Well, never mind.

52:59.750 --> 53:01.000
Once we get here,

53:01.380 --> 53:05.350
the towers become walls of defense so that monster will not be able to come near.

53:26.150 --> 53:28.140
No, it can't be.

53:29.570 --> 53:31.370
Sara!

53:32.640 --> 53:34.980
Sara!

53:36.770 --> 53:37.730
Everyone, stay back!

53:50.970 --> 53:52.130
Sara-sama!

53:54.300 --> 53:55.870
I can't move.

53:55.870 --> 53:56.590
Run.

54:03.570 --> 54:05.340
Sara!

54:06.440 --> 54:10.270
You are a useless and stupid puppet princess.

54:11.200 --> 54:13.680
Your role here is finished.

54:13.680 --> 54:15.810
Die quietly.

54:34.980 --> 54:36.060
Naruto.

54:36.060 --> 54:38.660
You are not a puppet princess.

54:44.350 --> 54:46.480
Do what you have to!

55:06.680 --> 55:08.070
Damn it!

55:14.130 --> 55:15.200
Naruto...

55:17.630 --> 55:19.340
What I have to do...

55:20.640 --> 55:21.550
Mother...

55:22.640 --> 55:30.380
Dragon path to be protected.

55:30.380 --> 55:37.270
Pierce with the shining blade. Look to the sky.

55:38.830 --> 55:45.150
The light flowing in spirals.

55:45.870 --> 55:51.820
To the garden where the dragon's claw ends.

55:52.920 --> 55:58.280
Shadows of the olden days.

56:11.980 --> 56:13.110
Sorry for being so late.

56:13.110 --> 56:13.800
No problem!

56:16.900 --> 56:17.750
Naruto!

56:41.500 --> 56:45.670
I can stop the source of the Ryuumyaku and protect the people!

56:45.670 --> 56:46.920
I see.

56:46.920 --> 56:49.220
That's why Anrokuzan was after your life.

56:49.220 --> 56:56.230
Anrozukan can't withstand the power of the Ryuumyaku at the garden where you and I first met, so he could not go there!

56:56.230 --> 56:57.320
Right there!

56:57.320 --> 56:57.930
Sara!

56:57.930 --> 56:58.770
Right!

57:00.970 --> 57:04.220
Everyone, there is a safe place near the Ryuumyaku.

57:04.430 --> 57:06.020
Let's all go there!

57:06.020 --> 57:08.980
There, that monster should not be able to reach us!

57:14.650 --> 57:16.160
Come, let's go!

57:16.160 --> 57:18.860
Ah! Come on everyone, let's go!

57:18.860 --> 57:19.890
Right, let's go!

57:19.890 --> 57:20.740
Right!

57:20.740 --> 57:22.190
Let's go!

57:22.190 --> 57:23.280
Follow Queen Sara!

57:23.280 --> 57:25.130
Together with Queen Sara!

57:25.610 --> 57:26.810
Sara!

57:26.810 --> 57:30.010
I cannot let you live.

57:30.440 --> 57:31.860
Go, Sara!

57:31.860 --> 57:34.270
Don't give up!

57:34.270 --> 57:35.070
Yes!

57:35.070 --> 57:36.960
Everyone hurry!

57:37.430 --> 57:39.300
You are not gett—

57:39.300 --> 57:39.720
Wait!
You are not gett—

57:39.720 --> 57:40.120
Wait!

57:40.120 --> 57:41.650
This is our job.

57:41.650 --> 57:42.430
Huh?

57:42.430 --> 57:44.340
You protect Sara.

57:44.340 --> 57:46.720
We can gain more time by splitting up.

57:46.720 --> 57:49.250
What are you guys saying?

57:49.250 --> 57:51.200
They're right.

57:51.200 --> 57:52.690
He's a tough one.

57:53.010 --> 57:55.590
It's better we draw multiple lines of defense.

57:55.590 --> 57:56.950
But...

57:57.700 --> 57:59.380
Please hurry, everyone!

57:59.380 --> 58:00.400
Get to the underground here!

58:01.320 --> 58:03.100
Trust us.

58:03.100 --> 58:03.490
Go!

58:05.180 --> 58:06.310
Come, let's go.

58:07.820 --> 58:08.880
I got it.

58:08.880 --> 58:09.930
Counting on you.

58:09.930 --> 58:11.580
Sara!

58:11.580 --> 58:13.930
I will not let you get to the Ryuumyaku!

58:19.140 --> 58:20.540
Say that...

58:20.540 --> 58:22.470
...after you beat us!

58:28.450 --> 58:30.360
What? The ground's...

58:30.850 --> 58:33.280
Ninja Art: Insect Illusion Technique

58:39.680 --> 58:40.960
Freak.

58:40.960 --> 58:42.580
This is the end for you!

58:43.040 --> 58:46.530
My insects will suck your chakra dry!

58:50.830 --> 58:52.920
The rest is up to you, Choza!

58:52.920 --> 58:53.710
Leave it to me!

59:08.190 --> 59:09.390
Alright!

59:24.560 --> 59:26.500
His Chakra is increasing?!

59:31.460 --> 59:33.890
Chakra that even my insects can't suck dry?

59:34.270 --> 59:37.840
This amount of Chakra is nothing!

59:38.060 --> 59:43.680
Either way he's just a puppet, so there must be a limit to the amount of chakra he can store.

59:48.470 --> 59:51.390
No, his Chakra is unlimited.

59:51.850 --> 59:55.670
Looks that the tower is transmitting plasma chakra to him...

59:56.320 --> 59:58.020
Spinning Puppet Attack!

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.270
I knew it...

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:23.460
What's up?

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:26.920
He's absorbed the power of the Ryuumyaku.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.110
If we don't seal the power of the Ryuumyaku, his chakra will continue to increase.

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:32.450
What the hell?!

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:36.480
Even so, he must have a weakness.

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:38.070
What the...?

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:49.590
Anrokuzan!

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.210
Sara!

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:52.930
Get everyone to safety, quick!

01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:53.710
Understood.

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:54.920
Come, everyone.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.480
I can't let you pass!

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:15.030
Rasengan!

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.610
I shall hold here!

01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:31.000
You go protect Sara!

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:31.730
But...

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:33.730
We can't fight him head on.

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:36.820
I have a way to know his weakness!

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:38.030
So just go!

01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:39.810
I got it.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.280
What?

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.850
He's regenerating too fast!

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:32.440
The garden is beyond these stairs!

01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:35.440
The power of the Ryuumyaku cannot reach there!

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.090
He's coming!

01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:40.150
Hurry, Sara!

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:41.030
Right!

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.500
No way!

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.580
What's wrong?

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:53.420
The mechanism in the door must'ce been damaged when the tower collapsed.

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:53.910
Huh?!

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:54.720
The door's damaged?

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.750
What will happen to us?

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.620
Is there nowhere else we can run?

01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:10.380

Are you all right?

01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:12.990
Take this!

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.520

Please...

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.940
Everyone...

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:27.500
Come on, everyone! Put your strength into it!

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.910
Alright!

We're saved!

01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:15.050
Come, everyone, let's go inside!

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:16.140
Let's hurry!
Come, everyone, let's go inside!

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:16.500
Yay!
Come, everyone, let's go inside!

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.570
Yay!

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.580
Sara-sama!

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.020
Sara-sama?

01:06:32.330 --> 01:06:35.390
I still have something I have to do.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:51.780
Naruto!

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.170
Damn it!

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:58.640
Everyone has evacuated to the garden!

01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.750
Great.

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:03.840
I found you, Sara!

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:09.040
Anrokuzan's power is infinite until we stop the source of the Ryuumyaku.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.770
I will stop it!

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:16.380
Ya. I'm counting on you.

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:16.950
I know.

01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:29.480
I will stop him here!

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:40.040
Hang in there!

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.960
You impudent little brat!

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.490
It's not over yet!

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.740
(龍脈 りゅうか の)
Ryuumyaku Ryuuka no
Ryuumyaku Dragon Fire!

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:29.250
What a huge amount of chakra...

01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:31.609
But...

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:36.660
I can't let him get past here!

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:53.210
Stop the source of the Ryuumyaku!

01:08:57.370 --> 01:08:59.220
There is only one way then!

01:08:59.220 --> 01:08:59.870
Yeah!

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.910
Alright!

01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:13.189
It's all yours!

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:21.010
Eat this!

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:23.330
What?

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:31.560
Naruto!

01:09:34.090 --> 01:09:36.420
What's the matter, Leaf brat!

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.200
Damn it.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.359
I don't have enough chakra...

01:09:40.689 --> 01:09:42.620
Is that all you have?

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:48.330
Die!

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:53.370
Are you all right?

01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:55.920
I will open up his weakness!

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.270
Then you hit him with your Rasengan!

01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:01.750
It's no use. I can't bring up my chakra anymore...

01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:03.510
I will lend you mine.

01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:04.510
That's impossible!

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.600
Rasengan is a technique that the 4th Hokage completed.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.980
Only Ero-sennin and I can use it...

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.180
Then, I can do it too.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.610
Come put out your right hand!

01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:17.280
Alright.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:27.040
So you still have chakra left.

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.180
Rasengan?!

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.930
What the hell is going on?

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:42.130
Similar types of chakra resonates when they are close.

01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:46.720
When these two Chakra combine, then the strongest Rasengan can be formed!

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.740
What is this?

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:55.820
This is the legendary Super Rasengan!

01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:58.110
What is that jutsu?

01:10:58.110 --> 01:11:01.290
I shall kill you before I kill Sara!

01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:13.290
Let me show you my strongest skill!

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.510
Ryuumyaku!

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:22.930

Naruto!

01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:06.250
His weak point is there!

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:07.230
Damn it!

01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:08.210
Sara!

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:09.810
The rest is up to you!

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.340
Ok!

01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:15.340
Leave it to me!

01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:19.260
Oh no you don't!

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:33.040
Super Rasengan!

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.030
Take this!

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.280
What?!

01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.240
The Five Shinobi Countries...

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:09.430
History should have been mine!!

01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:14.190
I can't die like this!

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.500
You all are going to...

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:19.710
Die together with me and the Ryuumyaku...

01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:54.840
This is bad.

01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.770
The Ryuumyaku's going to erupt...

01:13:59.180 --> 01:13:59.760
Sara!

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.700
Run!

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:17.950
Don't let go...

01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:19.900
Watch out!

01:14:20.830 --> 01:14:21.370
Wood Release!

01:14:33.770 --> 01:14:35.100
Captain Yamato!

01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:36.620
Everyone!

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.730
I made it...

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.440
The Flying Thunder God Kunai I gave you!

01:14:58.230 --> 01:15:00.650
Let's seal the Ryuumyaku completely!

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:01.980
Here...

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:11.850
Seal!

01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:34.560
What?

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.660
When Anrokuzan died, the seal returned,

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.150
so time is returning to normal again.

01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:43.600
It's time for you guys to go back to your time.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.560
Kakashi, seems you have done you mission well.

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:50.280
Kakashi Sensei?!

01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:54.380
I saved this Konoha person too!

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.530
He was lazing around in front of the gates of Rouran...

01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540
Ouch!

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.310
Why did you hit me?

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:03.470
Well, I was always bullied by you, you see.

01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:04.430
There you go.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.880
It's an honour to meet you.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:08.620
Huh?!

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:10.970
Captain Yamato this dude is...

01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:12.720
Sorry, but it's time to say farewell.

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:16.280
No, it's already time to part?

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.180
Ah, yeah.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.360
Sara, you did what you had to, right?

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:24.300
You are already a great Queen!

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:27.810
You will be fine even without us around.

01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:30.090
Yes, I will never forget you, Naruto.

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:35.360
It is better to lose this memory in order not to change history.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:39.910
Let's wipe out our memories, okay?

01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:41.570
Wait a minute!

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:44.590
Before that, you said that we would have a talk, right?

01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:45.570
Yeah.

01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:47.790
But not now.

01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:50.340
I am sure I will meet you once again.

01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.590
No way!

01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:54.230
You said you had something to say to me!

01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:57.300
If you don't tell me now, you wouldn't have a second chance!

01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:58.170
One day.

01:16:58.170 --> 01:17:00.030
I think you would surely know.

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:05.640
Metsu!

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:11.490
Dude!

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:15.110
You can't possibly be my...

01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:18.130
If I have a son, I will wish that...

01:17:18.130 --> 01:17:21.030
...he would be brought up as a ninja like you.

01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:32.090
Naruto!

01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:36.030
Rouran might dissapear as you said.

01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:39.050
But I have the people of Rouran with me!

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:43.020
I will do what I have to for the people!

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.490
It's what you taught me, Naruto!

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.270
Yeah!

01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:57.440
If you have the guts, you will surely be able to do it!

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:08.980
Naruto!

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:15.000
Naruto!

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.290
You alright, Naruto?!

01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:41.310
Captain Yamato!

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:49.010
What is going on?

01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:50.700
I can't remember anything.

01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:54.610
Ah... I wonder what happened?

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:04.700
Mukade is still missing, huh?

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:09.210
What's up Sakura-chan, getting  up all of a sudden!

01:19:09.210 --> 01:19:09.560
Huh?!

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:20.190
I passed by and felt the disturbance in the Ryuumyaku, so I came to take a look...

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.460
Disturbance?

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:25.730
My mother was a Quen who used to rule this land of Rouran.

01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:28.140
So if I use this, I would be able to feel...

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:30.860
...the pulse of the Ryuumyaku slightly.

01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:34.850
What the?!

01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:37.770
That's a Konoha chakra blade.

01:19:38.710 --> 01:19:41.290
It's my mother's treasure.

01:19:41.290 --> 01:19:45.230
She said it was handed to her by a hero in a dream.

01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:46.870
Your mother huh?

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:48.210
Yes.

01:19:48.210 --> 01:19:52.010
The city of Rouran vanished in the war.

01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:56.230
But the people survived because of my mother.

01:19:56.950 --> 01:20:01.690
I will inherit my mother's will and continue to live with the people.

01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:06.660
Sorry for disturbing you.

01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:08.170
No problem...

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.420
Well then...

01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:16.710
What is it, I wonder?

01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:18.890
I seem to have met her before...

01:20:20.050 --> 01:20:22.310
What are you spacing out for?

01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:23.060
You perv!

01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:24.200
Ouch!

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.060
No, it's not that!

01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:30.740
You must have dreamt a perverted dream while you were passed out.

01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.560
I didn't have any dream like that!

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:35.290
It was more like a sweeter dream than that.

01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:36.800
Ah, so it was a perverted dream after all then!

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.960
Hey, believe me, it was a sweet dream!

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.880
You're too good to be true!

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:41.950
It's the truth Sakura-chan!
