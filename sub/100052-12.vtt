19:59.023 --> 20:01.809
A guide wire is led up to the
heart valve from the groin.

20:01.852 --> 20:03.724
It gives a diagnostic view

20:03.767 --> 20:05.116
of what is going on

20:05.160 --> 20:06.466
and allows us to
repair the valve.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.032
Okay, I just...
I need to get my wife.

20:08.076 --> 20:09.338
I-I understand.

20:09.382 --> 20:11.906
But I need to prep her
for surgery right now.

20:12.950 --> 20:14.865
Now? I mean, right now?

20:14.909 --> 20:16.084
Why? Why right now?

20:16.127 --> 20:18.042
I'm sorry if I haven't
made myself clear.

20:18.086 --> 20:19.914
I was hoping
that the valve would heal.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.655
Now I'm certain that it won't.

20:21.698 --> 20:25.093
It's too dangerous
not to deal with this now.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.272

KRISTEN [recorded]:
Hi, this is Kristen Bouchard.

20:32.187 --> 20:33.971
If you leave your name

20:34.015 --> 20:35.103
[phone beeps]Okay.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.235
Okay. If you got to do it,

20:36.278 --> 20:37.584
you got to do it. Okay.Yeah.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.629
[whimpering and grunting]

20:44.068 --> 20:47.420
Oh, my God.
You're just going to cut me up

20:47.463 --> 20:49.900

Lando, wait.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.162
Sonia,

20:51.206 --> 20:52.120
you believe
in mercy, right?

20:52.163 --> 20:53.295
That wasmercy.

20:53.339 --> 20:56.385
[Lando gasps, grunts]

20:56.429 --> 20:58.909
[tape tearing]Remember,

20:58.953 --> 21:02.086
Jesus healed the ear
of the soldier.

21:02.130 --> 21:04.872
"Those who draw the sword
will die by the sword."

21:04.915 --> 21:07.135
Yes, but he also said,

21:07.178 --> 21:10.094
"Think not that I am come
to bring peace on Earth:

21:10.138 --> 21:12.183
"I came not to bring peace

21:12.227 --> 21:14.185
but a sword."[screams]

21:15.970 --> 21:17.928
This sword.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.930
I'll get the

21:33.770 --> 21:35.381
You have to find the key.

21:35.424 --> 21:37.078
Quick, unlock me.

21:37.121 --> 21:38.427
There's no time.
[groaning]

21:38.471 --> 21:40.603
Sh-She's not gonna
let you live either.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.562
She's going to
kill both of us.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.346
What are you doing?

21:44.390 --> 21:45.521
[grunting]

21:45.565 --> 21:47.567

21:49.133 --> 21:51.092

[siren whoops]

22:11.330 --> 22:13.332
[horns honking]

22:21.427 --> 22:23.211
And it was during
one of these sessions

22:23.254 --> 22:26.301
that Mr. LeRoux
physically attacked you?Yes.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.129
He leaped across the table,

22:28.172 --> 22:30.697
forced me to the ground
and strangled me.

22:30.740 --> 22:33.787
Multiple prison guards had
to pull him off.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.354
Thank you,
Doctor.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.181
[mouthing]

22:37.225 --> 22:40.576
Mrs. Bouchard, did my client
actually jump at you

22:40.620 --> 22:42.143
because you
taunted him?

22:42.186 --> 22:43.362
No.Really?

22:43.405 --> 22:44.667
You do remember
you're under oath, right?

22:44.711 --> 22:46.190
Doctor? Is it "Doctor"?

22:46.234 --> 22:48.367
Yes, "Doctor."

22:48.410 --> 22:49.977
And I do remember...

22:50.020 --> 22:51.370
[chuckles]
that I'm under oath.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.980
EMA:
Okay, did you

22:53.023 --> 22:55.983
not tell Mr. LeRoux that he
will never get out of prison?

22:58.377 --> 23:00.161
Do you need a moment,
Mrs. Bouchard?

23:01.467 --> 23:04.121
I did say those words

23:04.165 --> 23:05.601
but not at the moment

23:05.645 --> 23:07.647
when Mr. LeRoux attacked me.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.257
Well, good.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.215
That is a relief.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.522
And did you not taunt
Mr. LeRoux by saying to him--

23:13.566 --> 23:16.438
here it is-- "You are 48 years
old, and prisons have

23:16.482 --> 23:19.354
good health care, so you won't
get out till you are 100"?

23:19.398 --> 23:20.921
I did say that.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.357
But, again,

23:22.401 --> 23:24.315
not prior to Mr. LeRoux
attacking me.

23:24.359 --> 23:26.448
Do you usually taunt
your patients?

23:26.492 --> 23:28.450
Mr. LeRoux
was not a patient.

23:28.494 --> 23:31.714
And, also,
I had already... resigned

23:31.758 --> 23:33.324
from the case.Resigned or been fired?

23:33.368 --> 23:34.891
Objection.

I am just a comedian.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.244
I am not a soldier.

Then tell her that.

Explain that.

26:38.727 --> 26:41.687
I know what a horror movie
sounds like.

26:41.730 --> 26:45.038
And if you are not willing
to investigate the situation,

26:45.081 --> 26:46.648

the situation was hopeless,

29:09.660 --> 29:11.706
Uh, there's been a bit
of an emergency.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.056
Certainly.
Uh, I hope it all works out.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.145
Yeah. Me, too.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.240
[static]

29:30.899 --> 29:32.509
Hey. Here we are,

29:32.553 --> 29:34.424
just the two of us,
coming full circle.

29:34.468 --> 29:35.686
Oh, my goodness.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.515
Your testimony went
poorly today, didn't it?

29:38.559 --> 29:42.084
I think the judge was
leaning againstLeRoux

29:42.128 --> 29:43.520
until you testified.

29:43.564 --> 29:44.913
What do you think?

29:44.957 --> 29:46.480
And the sad thing is

29:46.523 --> 29:49.875
you had so many chances
to not get involved.

29:49.918 --> 29:52.747
How many times did I tell you
to go home to your daughters?

29:52.791 --> 29:55.141
Don't get involved in David.

29:55.184 --> 29:57.360
But then, every step of the way,

29:57.404 --> 29:59.362
you did the opposite.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.756
And now your husband's
offering this gift:

30:01.800 --> 30:03.497
go climbing.

30:03.540 --> 30:06.717
And, yet, here
you still are.

30:07.893 --> 30:12.462
I'm gonna do for you
what God did for Job.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.725
Job had only three daughters.

30:14.769 --> 30:16.379
God killed them.

30:16.423 --> 30:18.468
You have four daughters.

30:18.512 --> 30:20.949
I'm gonna kill every last one,

30:20.993 --> 30:22.037
then your husband,

30:22.081 --> 30:23.473
then burn down your house.

30:23.517 --> 30:25.084
I'm not gonna touch you though,

30:25.127 --> 30:27.086
no, because I want you
to live with the realization

30:27.129 --> 30:29.175
that you're responsible
for their deaths,

30:29.218 --> 30:31.090
that you let them die

30:31.133 --> 30:33.875
through your obstinacy,
your need

30:33.919 --> 30:37.487
to win...God, you talk too much.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.491
If I were you,
I would not...

30:41.535 --> 30:42.928
What, tempt you?

30:42.971 --> 30:44.712
Seriously?
Is that how the Devil works,

30:44.755 --> 30:46.888
he needs to be tempted
to do wrong?

30:46.932 --> 30:49.586
I am not to be trifled...

30:49.630 --> 30:51.545
Jake Perry.

30:53.416 --> 30:54.374
What?

30:54.417 --> 30:55.592
That's your real name.

30:55.636 --> 30:57.812
You're an insurance adjuster
from Des Moines.

31:00.423 --> 31:02.295
Or at least you were
until your second divorce.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.558
Then you moved to New York,
went to college and decided

31:04.601 --> 31:06.821
to recreate yourself
as Leland Townsend,

31:06.865 --> 31:08.954
a forensic psychologist
psychopath.

31:08.997 --> 31:10.390
Is that what
the Devil does?

31:10.433 --> 31:12.827
Uh, you...Yep, the Devil
may be tech-savvy,

31:12.871 --> 31:13.959
but so are we mortals.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.743
And all I had to do

31:15.786 --> 31:18.398
was use some of the genetic
material that you left

31:18.441 --> 31:21.227
on a glass in my kitchen, ask
the help of a detective friend

31:21.270 --> 31:23.620
and, bang,
there it was, a match.

31:23.664 --> 31:24.708
The Devil can use anybody...

31:24.752 --> 31:26.536
Really, Jake?

31:26.580 --> 31:28.060
"Jake the Flake,"

31:28.103 --> 31:31.672
shyest boy in the class of 1979
at Roosevelt High School.

31:31.715 --> 31:33.674
Honorary member
of band club.

31:33.717 --> 31:36.720
How was playing the tuba
in marching band?

31:36.764 --> 31:38.548
And let's talk
about your first wife.

31:38.592 --> 31:40.246
Aw. Janey.

31:40.289 --> 31:41.508
She wanted to have children,

31:41.551 --> 31:43.858
but you had trouble
getting it up, didn't you?

31:43.902 --> 31:45.294
None of this is true.

31:45.338 --> 31:46.730
And then
your second wife, Tina--

31:46.774 --> 31:48.428
she married you
for the money.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.343
Do you want to know how I know?

31:50.386 --> 31:51.910
I just gave her a call.

31:51.953 --> 31:56.088
I mean, you'd think if-if the
Devil had anybody to inhabit,

31:56.131 --> 31:58.525
he'd use a better specimen.

31:58.568 --> 32:00.701
No?

32:00.744 --> 32:02.703
I am going to...

32:02.746 --> 32:04.183
What? Hurt me?

32:04.226 --> 32:05.575
How?

32:05.619 --> 32:07.186
You're a nothing man
from Des Moines

32:07.229 --> 32:08.970
who is using the imagery
of satanism--

32:09.014 --> 32:10.711
a satanism you probably
don't even believe--

32:10.754 --> 32:12.713
to pretend you weren't
the third chair tuba player

32:12.756 --> 32:14.541
in the Roosevelt
High School band.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.760
Here's a thought... Jake.

32:16.804 --> 32:18.806
Get a life.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.250
Kristen!

32:28.294 --> 32:29.469
DAVID:
You're making a mistake!No, don't do it. Please!

32:29.512 --> 32:31.210
DAVID:
Don't do it, Sonia.I am only...

32:31.253 --> 32:34.082
This is wrong....asking if you are
right-handed.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.954
No. No, no, no, no, no!
I'm left-handed.

32:39.566 --> 32:42.134
Then this is the hand
that held the machete.

32:42.177 --> 32:43.700
[gasps]Lando, tell her!

32:44.571 --> 32:47.704
Just... tell her.

32:47.748 --> 32:49.750
[panting]

32:50.881 --> 32:53.014
I did not use a machete.

32:53.058 --> 32:56.365
I did not!Just... what did you do?

32:58.759 --> 33:00.717
I was funny.

33:00.761 --> 33:03.329
That's all.

33:03.372 --> 33:05.374
I-I said what I was told to say.

33:05.418 --> 33:07.637
And you said those things?!

33:07.681 --> 33:10.640
Yes! Yes!
[panting]

33:10.684 --> 33:12.642
I never hurt anyone.

33:12.686 --> 33:16.037
I'm a comedian.
I make jokes.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.474
I-I love Robin Williams.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.433
I love Richard Pryor.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.522
I-I punch up.
I don't punch down.

33:22.565 --> 33:24.089
Punch up at what?!

33:24.132 --> 33:26.134
Tutsis.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.398
They were wealthy.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.400
They-they had power.

33:31.444 --> 33:32.662
They had cattle.

33:32.706 --> 33:34.795
I told jokes about them.

33:34.838 --> 33:37.319
Every comedian
makes fun of people,

33:37.363 --> 33:40.018
but you make fun
of people in power.

33:41.497 --> 33:42.629
[gasps sharply]

33:42.672 --> 33:45.545
It doesn't make
people into killers.

33:48.548 --> 33:51.681
That was a confession, Sonia.

33:53.509 --> 33:55.511
Let him go.

33:55.555 --> 33:57.557
Please.

34:01.517 --> 34:02.823
DAUGHTERS:

Idam guru ratna...

34:08.176 --> 34:10.222
Kristen?

34:10.265 --> 34:12.137
Idam guru... Is Laura okay?

34:12.180 --> 34:13.442
She's fine.
She's fine.Where is she?

34:13.486 --> 34:14.661
She's in the recovery room.

34:14.704 --> 34:16.619
Ben, the Magnificent!

34:16.663 --> 34:18.534
They're operating on Laura.Hey. Hey. Aw.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.841
Come here. We're
gonna make...

34:20.884 --> 34:22.582
Hey. Oh.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.627
What were they doing?

34:24.671 --> 34:26.499
I-I don't know.
I didn't see.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.501
They were chanting.Were they?

34:28.544 --> 34:30.677
Yeah.Is-is that a problem
if they were?

34:30.720 --> 34:32.331
I just think we should discuss

34:32.374 --> 34:34.942
before sharing any
religion with the girls.

34:34.985 --> 34:36.813
I didn't share anything
with them.

34:36.857 --> 34:39.077
Well, then
how did they...?Oh, I don't know.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.166
How do they find out anything?
The Internet.

34:42.950 --> 34:46.954
I was in the church when I heard
the... the gates torn open.

34:46.997 --> 34:51.611
I ran, but I was struck
from behind with a metal pipe.

34:51.654 --> 34:54.048
I fell.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.659
And my sister fell next to me.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.792
Half her face was gone.

34:58.835 --> 35:00.968
I pretended to be dead.

35:01.011 --> 35:02.404
Even as I heard

35:02.448 --> 35:05.059
the Hutus take the babies

35:05.103 --> 35:07.105
from the arms of their mothers

35:07.148 --> 35:09.281
and crack their heads

35:09.324 --> 35:11.718
on the western
wall of the church.

35:11.761 --> 35:14.199
Oh, there were so many...

35:14.242 --> 35:17.158
terrible things I heard.

35:17.202 --> 35:21.336
But the most terrible sound
was the laughing.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.512
The Hutu men

35:23.556 --> 35:25.514
telling your jokes

35:25.558 --> 35:28.517
about cockroaches
and laughing

35:28.561 --> 35:31.781
as they hacked everyone
to pieces.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.827
[cries]

35:35.655 --> 35:37.700
[wind whispering]

35:39.615 --> 35:41.965
[whispering continues]

35:46.361 --> 35:48.494
Sonia.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.681
I believe God sees everything.

36:03.030 --> 36:06.947
He will understand
why I do what I do.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.036
No! No!

36:09.079 --> 36:11.473
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry. I'm so sor...

36:11.517 --> 36:13.823
I'm just very sorry.

36:13.867 --> 36:15.869
Believe me.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.698
[sighs]

36:20.917 --> 36:22.963
[sighs heavily]

36:23.006 --> 36:24.965
Thank you.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.619
I forgive you.

36:26.662 --> 36:28.708
Your soul is clean.

36:28.751 --> 36:30.753
Ah. [panting]

36:36.672 --> 36:39.240
[gasps]

36:48.989 --> 36:50.686
Why did you do that?

36:50.730 --> 36:52.253
He asked forgiveness.

36:52.297 --> 36:53.950
And I forgave him.

36:53.994 --> 36:56.475
But you killed him.

36:56.518 --> 36:58.259
Yes.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.261
But not for revenge.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.437
For justice.

37:02.481 --> 37:04.265
[phone dialing]

37:04.309 --> 37:06.180
Hello.

37:06.224 --> 37:10.271
There has been a shooting
at 1865 Grand.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.578
Yes, one dead body.

37:12.621 --> 37:15.929
Sonia Kamanzi.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.279
I shot him.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.890
Yes.

37:23.197 --> 37:25.155
And please send an ambulance.

37:25.199 --> 37:27.419
There's an injured man
here, too.

37:47.134 --> 37:49.267
JUDGE:
The question is always
about justice.

37:49.310 --> 37:52.444
How best to servejustice.

37:52.487 --> 37:55.708
These murders may have
at first appeared

37:55.751 --> 37:57.884
to be two separate cases,

37:57.927 --> 38:01.104
but after careful
consideration,

38:01.148 --> 38:02.454
there is only one.

38:02.497 --> 38:04.238
Orson LeRoux,

38:04.282 --> 38:06.022
I overturn your conviction
on all counts.

38:06.066 --> 38:07.633
You are free to go.[gallery clamoring]

38:15.597 --> 38:18.600
He's gonna kill me.
He's gonna kill me.

38:18.644 --> 38:20.907
He's gonna kill me. He's
gonna kill me.

38:20.950 --> 38:22.212
May I hug you, sir?

38:24.214 --> 38:26.956
I want you to have this.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.828
It's my personal Bible.

38:28.871 --> 38:32.962
I hope it helps you
find some peace.

38:33.006 --> 38:34.486
I was so brave.

You really were, and
I'm so proud of you.

38:44.670 --> 38:46.149
It's underneath.

No.

Is everything okay?

The results are a bit unusual.

39:15.004 --> 39:16.571
Okay.

39:16.615 --> 39:19.531
Sometime between the EKG and
performing the cardiac cath...

39:19.574 --> 39:20.706
Mm-hmm.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.708
...the mitral valve
in Laura's heart

39:22.751 --> 39:24.753
has completely healed.

39:25.798 --> 39:27.452
It has?

39:27.495 --> 39:30.368
Yes. And I don't know how.

40:06.969 --> 40:08.449
Laura's well.
The kids are great.

40:08.493 --> 40:09.885
I can take care of them.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.192
I know you can, but I'm-I'm
not doing it for you.

40:12.235 --> 40:13.976
I'm doing it for me.

40:14.020 --> 40:17.153
I have a career here--
something that's challenging me.

40:17.197 --> 40:19.808
I... I don't want
to give it up.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.813
Okay. Okay.

40:25.814 --> 40:27.599
I'll go to Denver
to set it up,

40:27.642 --> 40:30.340
but I'm gonna get
one of the boys to run it.

40:30.384 --> 40:32.255
You don't have to.

40:32.299 --> 40:33.996
I know.

40:34.040 --> 40:36.042
Okay.

40:43.223 --> 40:47.009
So, um...

40:47.053 --> 40:48.533
the chant.

40:48.576 --> 40:50.143
Mm.

40:50.186 --> 40:52.624
What does it mean?
What were you praying for?

40:52.667 --> 40:54.756
Tong-Lin.
It-it means "giving and taking."

40:54.800 --> 40:56.845
It's like an exchange.

40:57.846 --> 40:59.848
What were you exchanging?

41:01.546 --> 41:03.504
Uh... well, I...

41:03.548 --> 41:06.942
I asked for Laura
to be healed.

41:06.986 --> 41:10.076
Um... in exchange
for my life.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.687
Andy.

41:12.731 --> 41:15.516
No. Don't worry.
It's just a mantra.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.866
Come on. Hey.

41:23.393 --> 41:25.526
LELAND:
She has this way
of getting to me.

41:25.570 --> 41:28.660
I'll be feeling all-knowing
and all-powerful, and then,

41:28.703 --> 41:32.664
she's in my face,
and I just feel... impotent.

41:32.707 --> 41:34.666
When you say
"impotent,"

41:34.709 --> 41:36.755
do you mean
sexually?

41:36.798 --> 41:38.452
No. Uh...

41:38.496 --> 41:41.281
She's talking about Jake
the Flake and the marching band.

41:41.324 --> 41:44.066
And why do people make fun
of marching bands?!

41:44.110 --> 41:45.677
That's a worthy entertainment.

41:45.720 --> 41:47.548
And I just...

41:47.592 --> 41:49.550
[sighs]

41:49.594 --> 41:51.683
I should have ripped out
her heart.

41:51.726 --> 41:54.337
Why didn't you?

41:54.381 --> 41:57.515
It's not part of the plan,
or has that changed?

41:59.734 --> 42:01.954
Do you wantthe
plan to change?

42:04.609 --> 42:06.567
No.

42:06.611 --> 42:08.700
Good.

42:08.743 --> 42:11.180
Then find someone else
to take her heart out,

42:11.224 --> 42:14.488
and you and I will
eat it together.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.491
Now tell me
about your dreams.
