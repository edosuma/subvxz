WEBVTT

00:30.410 --> 00:33.150
THIS IS ONE KICKIN' BOAT,
TECH.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.420
WITH MY SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
OF AQUADYNAMICS,

00:35.420 --> 00:38.290
IT WAS NO CHALLENGE
TO BUILD THE ULTIMATE
WATER CRAFT.

00:38.290 --> 00:40.520
AND WITH THE TOP UP,
IT'LL MAKE 400 KNOTS
UNDERWATER.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.630
WHY DO THEY CALL 'EM
KNOTS, ANYWAY? I CAN MAKE
REAL KNOTS.

00:42.630 --> 00:44.460
I CAN MAKE A SLIP KNOT,
A DOUBLE KNOT, A WINDSOR
KNOT, A HALF-HITCH KNOT,

00:44.460 --> 00:46.160
A DOUBLE-HITCH KNOT,
A FORGET-ME-NOT--

00:46.160 --> 00:49.870
SPEAKING OF KNOTS,
THAT WAS HIGHLY ELUCIDATING.

00:49.870 --> 00:51.370
NOT.

00:56.770 --> 00:58.380
WOW, THIS IS THE LIFE.

00:58.380 --> 01:01.210
OUT AT SEA, PERCHED
ON THE RAIL OF A SHIP.

01:01.210 --> 01:03.380
AFTER ALL,
I AM A WATER FOWL.

01:03.380 --> 01:06.180
OHH, "AFOUL" IS THE WORD
FOR IT, ALL RIGHT.

01:06.180 --> 01:08.890
I'VE NEVER FELT SO SEASICK
IN MY LIFE.

01:08.890 --> 01:10.320
HA HA! BUCK UP, LEXI.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.490
YOU'VE JUST GOTTA GET
YOUR SEA LEGS LIKE ME.

01:16.330 --> 01:19.400
WHOA, HO-HO!
DUCK OVERBOARD!

01:20.060 --> 01:21.300
HEY...

01:21.300 --> 01:23.100
MAD DOLPHIN!

01:29.910 --> 01:30.910
UNH!

01:34.910 --> 01:36.150
ENGINES FULL REVERSE!

01:42.120 --> 01:43.250
HEY, WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

01:43.250 --> 01:44.350
WHAT TURNED THE BOAT?

01:44.350 --> 01:46.760
OHHH. NOT TO MENTION
MY STOMACH.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.690
WHEW! THAT WAS CLOSE.
I HAVEN'T BEEN THAT SCARED

01:48.690 --> 01:50.630
SINCE I WENT ON THE JET
SLALOM AT ACMETROPOLIS
WATER PARK.

01:50.630 --> 01:52.360
OF COURSE, AT THE WATER
PARK, WE WEREN'T ABOUT
TO PLOW

01:52.360 --> 01:53.600
INTO A FULL-SIZED
OCEAN LINER!

01:53.600 --> 01:56.870
IT APPEARS WE'RE NOT
THEIR BIGGEST CONCERN.

02:02.870 --> 02:06.240
SINCE WHEN DO WHIRLPOOLS
FORM AROUND SHIPS?

02:06.240 --> 02:07.840
SINCE NOW.

02:09.450 --> 02:11.380
THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE
OF THE WHIRLPOOL,

02:11.380 --> 02:14.220
IT'S PULLING DOWN
THE SHIP.

02:17.820 --> 02:19.360
THIS IS NEW.

02:19.360 --> 02:20.560
HEY, GUYS!
GUESS WHAT ELSE

02:20.560 --> 02:24.360
IS COOL
ABOUT DUCK--
DUCK!

02:24.360 --> 02:27.660
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

02:32.970 --> 02:33.900
* ROCKETS OUT! *

02:33.900 --> 02:35.340
* LOONATICS BUST OUT *

02:35.340 --> 02:38.780
* REV, LEXI, AND TECH *

02:38.780 --> 02:41.750
* SLAM, AND DUCK *

02:41.750 --> 02:42.750
WORK IT!

02:42.750 --> 02:45.650
* ACE IS COOL
AND LEADS THE PACK *

02:45.650 --> 02:48.550
* ACE'S SWORD
DRIVES 'EM BACK *

02:49.650 --> 02:51.460
* WHEN BIG, BAD BOTS
SMACK DOWN, JACK *

02:51.460 --> 02:53.660
* LEXI'S BRAIN BLAST
MAKES 'EM CRACK *

02:53.660 --> 02:55.560
* QUACKIN' IN,
QUACKIN' OUT *

02:55.560 --> 02:57.660
* DUCK WILL MAKE
THEM TRAITORS SHOUT *

02:57.660 --> 02:59.400
* ACTIVATE, REGENERATE *

02:59.400 --> 03:01.970
* MAGNETIC POWERS
LEVITATE *

03:07.140 --> 03:08.840
BAM, SLAM!

03:08.840 --> 03:11.640
* UH, TORNADO ZING
WHEN HE MODELS *

03:11.640 --> 03:13.310
* IT'S SET. LET'S JET! *

03:13.310 --> 03:15.350
* SUPERSONIC REV
HEATS 'EM UP *

03:15.350 --> 03:17.180
* AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT *

03:17.180 --> 03:19.650
* IT'S SET. LET'S JET! *

03:23.150 --> 03:24.950
* SET! LET'S JET! *

03:26.920 --> 03:29.390
* WHOO! POWER
TO PROTECT AND SERVE *

03:29.390 --> 03:31.430
* TONS OF EGO,
LOTS OF NERVE *

03:31.430 --> 03:33.260
* NEVER QUESTION,
NEVER SWERVE *

03:33.260 --> 03:35.970
* LOONATICS UNLEASHED! *

03:42.370 --> 03:43.610
Tech: WE GOT A SIGNAL.

03:43.610 --> 03:45.740
THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN
IS LAUNCHING LIFE PODS.

03:45.740 --> 03:47.310
STAND BY, GUYS.

03:49.710 --> 03:52.180
Duck: WOW.
HOW MANY CHICKADEES

03:52.180 --> 03:54.120
DO YOU THINK
ARE IN THOSE EGGS?

03:54.120 --> 03:55.320
DON'T KNOW, DUCK.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.450
BUT IT'S A GOOD THING
WE WERE HERE.

03:57.450 --> 04:00.420
TIME TO GO FISHIN'.

04:00.420 --> 04:04.030
MY SHIP LOST!
BECAUSE OF THEM!

04:04.030 --> 04:05.400
MMM...THEM WHO?

04:05.400 --> 04:07.200
USE YOUR EARS, MAN!

04:07.200 --> 04:10.530
THE SQUEALS.
THE SQUEALS!

04:10.530 --> 04:14.000
EEE! EEE-EEE-EEE!

04:14.000 --> 04:16.570
I THINK SOMEBODY SWALLOWED
TOO MUCH SEA WATER.

04:16.570 --> 04:18.480
GEE, LOOK
AT THOSE DOLPHINS.
BOY, AREN'T THEY CUTE?

04:18.480 --> 04:21.580
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE STORIES
ABOUT THEM SAVING SAILORS
AND FIGHTING OFF SHARKS

04:21.580 --> 04:23.010
AND JUMPING THROUGH HOOPS
AT WATER PARKS.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.350
Voice: THAT SURFACE SLIME

04:26.350 --> 04:28.350
JUST BRINGS DOWN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:28.350 --> 04:29.550
WHAT DID HE SAY?

04:29.550 --> 04:31.590
I COULD HAVE SWORN--

04:34.420 --> 04:38.060
NO

04:39.760 --> 04:40.630
SAY,

04:40.630 --> 04:42.570
I GUESS YOU GUYS
ARE KINDA CUTE.

04:42.570 --> 04:44.170
NOW, DON'T BE AFRAID.

04:44.170 --> 04:45.600
HEY, WHAT--

04:45.600 --> 04:48.300
WHOA! TALK ABOUT
A PERSONALITY CHANGE!

04:49.310 --> 04:50.940
YIKES!

04:50.940 --> 04:52.310
AAH!

04:52.310 --> 04:53.810
THAT DOLPHIN'S
A SEA MONSTER!

04:53.810 --> 04:57.450
WITH--WITH HUGE FANGS
AND SHOULDER PADS
OR SOMETHING.

04:57.450 --> 04:59.050
HE'LL EAT US ALIVE,
I TELL YOU!

04:59.050 --> 05:01.320
LOOK, LOOK LOOK LOOK!

05:04.450 --> 05:06.120
TSK, TSK, TSK.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.420
LISTEN! THAT THING

05:07.420 --> 05:09.390
TURNED INTO ONE MESS
OF UGLY.

05:09.390 --> 05:10.530
HEY, CUT THE COMEDY, DUCK.

05:10.530 --> 05:12.100
WE GOTTA FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOIN' ON

05:12.100 --> 05:13.660
WITH THAT FREAKY WHIRLPOOL.

05:13.660 --> 05:16.670
I THINK WE SHOULD PAY
ZODAVIA A VISIT.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.000
Duck: YOU GUYS DON'T
BELIEVE ME, DO YOU?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.340
ABOUT THAT DEVIL FISH?

05:21.340 --> 05:23.270
Tech: THEY APPEAR TO BE
ABSOLUTE TEXTBOOK DOLPHINS
TO ME.

05:23.270 --> 05:25.210
Rev: OF COURSE, DOLPHINS
LOOK A LOT LIKE PORPOISES,
ALTHOUGH PORPOISES

05:25.210 --> 05:27.140
ARE SMALLER AND HAVE
TRIANGULAR DORSAL FINS
RATHER THAN FINS SHAPED

05:27.140 --> 05:29.210
LIKE A WAVE
LIKE THE DOLPHINS HAVE.
AND THEY BOTH ARE MAMMALS

05:29.210 --> 05:31.680
AND MAKE SQUEALING SOUNDS
THAT CAN BE IRRITATING
IF YOU HAVE AN IRRITABLE

05:31.680 --> 05:33.780
DISPOSITION WHEN IT COMES--
Tech: ENOUGH, REV.

05:33.780 --> 05:36.150
I TELL YOU,
THOSE DOLPHINS ARE EVIL.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.190
THERE HAVE BEEN
SEVERAL REPORTS

05:40.190 --> 05:42.290
OF MYSTERIOUS ATTACKS
AT SEA.

05:42.290 --> 05:43.360
OBSERVE.

05:45.230 --> 05:47.960
DISAPPEARING OIL RIGS,
LIGHTHOUSES, SHIPS,

05:47.960 --> 05:52.700
OCEANOGRAPHY STATIONS,
AND EVEN SMALL LAND MASSES.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.400
THE SIZE OR WEIGHT
OF THE STRUCTURE

05:54.400 --> 05:56.340
DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER.

05:56.340 --> 05:57.410
ZODAVIA, HANG ON.

05:57.410 --> 05:58.910
WHAT'S GOTTEN
INTO THOSE WHALES?

05:58.910 --> 06:02.780
THEY'RE SWIMMING
IN FORMATION AND
CAUSING THE WHIRLPOOL.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.580
ZOOM IN. AND THOSE DOLPHINS

06:06.580 --> 06:09.450
ARE ON THE SCENE EVERY TIME.

06:09.450 --> 06:11.860
THERE WAS SOMETHING WEIRD
ABOUT THEM.

06:11.860 --> 06:15.660
IT SOUNDED LIKE
THAT DOLPHIN WAS TALKING.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.130
REALLY?

06:17.130 --> 06:19.460
DOLPHINS ARE HIGHLY
INTELLIGENT CREATURES

06:19.460 --> 06:22.270
WITH QUITE SOPHISTICATED
COMMUNICATION SKILLS.

06:22.270 --> 06:24.870
HEY, TECH. CAN YOU RIG UP
SOME LANGUAGE TRANSLATORS

06:24.870 --> 06:27.470
SO THAT WE CAN TALK
TO THOSE DOLPHINS?

06:27.470 --> 06:28.940
CHILD'S PLAY.

06:28.940 --> 06:30.610
ZODAVIA

06:30.610 --> 06:34.010
OF COURSE, TECH.
BE MY GUEST.

06:37.780 --> 06:39.750
LET'S SEE,
HOW DID I DO THIS?

06:39.750 --> 06:41.490
I JUST STUCK MY HAND
IN THE WATER,

06:41.490 --> 06:44.090
TRIED TO SHOOT AN ENERGY EGG
LIKE THIS.

06:44.090 --> 06:45.190
WHO-HO-HOW!

06:48.120 --> 06:49.190
HEY, GUYS!

06:49.190 --> 06:50.260
LOOKY WHAT I CAN DO.

06:50.260 --> 06:51.630
I'VE GOT THIS COOL
NEW POWER.

06:51.630 --> 06:54.030
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
IT'S COLOSSAL.

06:54.030 --> 06:55.430
IT'S--

06:55.430 --> 06:57.130
All: UGH, EW.

06:57.130 --> 06:59.400
A LAUGH RIOT.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.400
OOPSIE?

07:01.400 --> 07:03.510
Tech: ENGAGE YOUR DOLPHIN
COMMUNICATORS.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.410
Ace: ALL SET, TECH.

07:05.410 --> 07:07.210
EJECTING SEA PODS.

07:10.550 --> 07:12.550
Duck: WHOO-HOO!
WATER SPORTS!

07:12.550 --> 07:14.580
YEAH! IS THIS GREAT
OR WHAT?

07:14.580 --> 07:17.150
SO...WHAT ARE WE DOING
AGAIN?

07:17.150 --> 07:18.790
UGH. GOT ANYTHING, REV?

07:18.790 --> 07:20.720
I'M PICKING UP LIFE FORMS
INSIDE THAT

07:20.720 --> 07:23.690
SOME KIND OF COOL OLD SHIP.
IT CAN'T BE THAT CRUISE SHIP,
IT MUST BE SOME KIND

07:23.690 --> 07:25.060
OF NEAT OLD RUSTED
BATTLESHIP!

07:25.060 --> 07:28.930
Tech: HUH. EARLY 21st
CENTURY DESIGN, I WOULD SAY.

07:28.930 --> 07:33.170
Ace: AND A NICE, COZY HOME
FOR THOSE DOLPHINS.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.770
Lexi: WAIT! WE COME
IN PEACE.

07:35.770 --> 07:37.940
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU,
THEY DON'T.

07:37.940 --> 07:40.540
Ace: RELAX, DUCK.
THEY'RE ALL WE GOT
TO GO ON.

07:40.540 --> 07:42.580
LEXI AND SLAM, FOLLOW
THE ONES ON THE RIGHT.

07:42.580 --> 07:44.250
DUCK, YOU STAY WITH ME.

07:48.750 --> 07:52.290
HEY, COME BACK.
IT'S OK.

07:52.290 --> 07:53.590
WHERE'D THEY GO?

07:53.590 --> 07:54.790
I'M SWITCHING ON SONAR.

07:54.790 --> 07:56.230
SLAM, YOU DO THE SAME.

07:56.230 --> 07:57.590
GOT IT.

08:11.170 --> 08:13.540
HUH?

08:13.540 --> 08:15.580
UH-OH.

08:15.580 --> 08:19.050
UNH! UHH! UNH!

08:25.590 --> 08:28.660
RRRAAAHHHH!

08:31.360 --> 08:32.560
SLAM, ARE YOU O--

08:34.830 --> 08:37.070
WHOA!

08:38.100 --> 08:41.840
DUCK WAS RIGHT.
THEY DON'T COME IN PEACE.

08:42.340 --> 08:45.170
IT'S BRAIN BLAST TIME.

08:49.650 --> 08:51.510
YAAAAH!

08:51.510 --> 08:53.320
UNH! OHH...

08:56.920 --> 09:01.220
OH, UNH. SLAM,
HELP. HURRY!

09:01.220 --> 09:03.360
HERE I COME!

09:03.360 --> 09:05.260
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:05.260 --> 09:06.930
MY BRAIN BLAST BACKFIRED.

09:06.930 --> 09:10.070
AWW, YOU HAD A BOO-BOO.

09:10.070 --> 09:12.000
UHH...

09:13.370 --> 09:15.140
Ace: DUCK, WATCH OUT!

09:15.140 --> 09:16.910
Both: AAHHH!

09:19.710 --> 09:21.280
Duck: WHOA-OA-OA!

09:41.300 --> 09:42.430
MAMA!

09:42.430 --> 09:44.970
UH...OK, YOU TWO.
BACK OFF.

09:44.970 --> 09:47.570
OR TASTE THE STING OF MY...

09:47.570 --> 09:48.710
UH...

09:48.710 --> 09:51.010
WAIT. WHAT'LL I CALL IT?
HEAVY WATER!

09:51.010 --> 09:54.240
NO, THAT'S NO GOOD.
SLIME-O DRIP!

09:54.240 --> 09:55.380
NO. WAIT!

09:55.380 --> 09:58.510
AQUA DENSE!
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

09:58.510 --> 09:59.880
NNGYAAH!

10:04.490 --> 10:06.960
WOW! THAT WORKED GREAT!

10:07.960 --> 10:11.260
HOW DO YOU LIKE
THEM APPLES, ACE?

10:11.260 --> 10:14.530
UH, ACE

10:14.530 --> 10:16.630
ACE!

10:19.170 --> 10:22.140
UNH! UNFF! AH...

10:22.140 --> 10:23.610
OOF!

10:23.610 --> 10:25.240
HUH?

10:25.240 --> 10:27.380
UH-OH.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.610
HMM. HAVE YOU TRIED

10:31.610 --> 10:33.050
MODIFYING THE HARMONIC
MANDIBULATOR?

10:33.050 --> 10:34.720
OR RE-TRIANGULATING
THE HYPOSTATIC WAVELENGTH?

10:34.720 --> 10:36.490
OR HOW ABOUT UPLINKING
A BIFLUXION VECTOR FLAT?

10:36.490 --> 10:40.060
I STILL CAN'T LOCK ONTO
EITHER DUCK OR ACE'S
COMM UNIT.

10:40.060 --> 10:42.830
SEAL THE HATCHES!
CALL THE MARINES!

10:42.830 --> 10:45.390
HOIST THE MIZZENMAST!

10:45.390 --> 10:46.300
WHERE'S ACE?

10:46.300 --> 10:47.660
HE'S BEEN FISH-NAPPED!

10:47.660 --> 10:49.530
I MEAN, DOLPH-NAPPED.
GAHH! KIDNAPPED!

10:49.530 --> 10:50.730
BY DOLPHINS!

10:50.730 --> 10:52.170
SEE? THOSE DOLPHINS
WERE COMING AT ME,

10:52.170 --> 10:54.940
AND I SLAMMED 'EM
WITH MY NEW AQUA DENSE
POWER,

10:54.940 --> 10:56.210
AND IT WORKED SO GREAT.

10:56.210 --> 10:59.740
DENSE IS RIGHT.
YOU LET ACE GET CAPTURED.

10:59.740 --> 11:01.580
Tech: BUT NOW
THE QUESTION IS,

11:01.580 --> 11:03.110
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO
WITH HIM?

11:04.280 --> 11:05.750
Ace:

11:07.020 --> 11:10.620
NNH! UNH!
I LOVE YOU, TOO, PAL,

11:10.620 --> 11:13.190
BUT LET'S GO EASY
ON THE HUGS, HUH?

11:14.890 --> 11:16.090
OK, FLIPPER, WHAT GIVES?

11:16.090 --> 11:18.830
YOU GOT A PROBLEM,
COTTONTAIL?

11:18.830 --> 11:20.830
I HATE CUTE NICKNAMES.

11:20.830 --> 11:25.600
I WANT RESPECT!
SO CALL ME ADOLPHO.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.510
THAT'S THE NAME.
GOT IT?

11:29.510 --> 11:32.180
IT'S PAYBACK TIME.

11:32.180 --> 11:35.010
YOU DIRT-DWELLERS
RUINED OUR HOME,

11:35.010 --> 11:37.310
MESSED UP OUR OCEANS,

11:39.150 --> 11:42.450
NOT TO MENTION
PUT US IN YOUR CREEPY

11:42.450 --> 11:45.890
WATER PARK SHOWS.

11:45.890 --> 11:48.790
AND THEY MAKE YOU WEAR
THAT UGLY MAKEUP.

11:48.790 --> 11:52.830
OOH, I'M SORRY.
THAT WOULD BE YOUR FACE.

11:52.830 --> 11:56.930
DON'T TEST MY PATIENCE,
FUZZPANTS.

11:56.930 --> 11:58.630
MY BRAIN'S BEEN FRIED.

11:58.630 --> 12:03.510
MY NOGGIN'S
BEEN NOODLED WITH.
I GOT A REAL NASTY TEMPER,

12:03.510 --> 12:04.910
AND I WANT REVENGE.

12:04.910 --> 12:09.010
YOU SEE, YOUR POLLUTION
CAUSED US TO MUTATE

12:09.010 --> 12:12.250
IN SEVERAL UNEXPECTED WAYS.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.520
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
WHY YOU'RE SO GABBY.

12:14.520 --> 12:18.150
SO, I GUESS THOSE WHALES
ARE FRIENDS OF YOURS, HUH?

12:18.150 --> 12:20.190
HEH HEH HEH.

12:20.190 --> 12:23.260
LET'S JUST SAY
THAT MY WISH

12:23.260 --> 12:25.130
IS THEIR COMMAND.

12:25.130 --> 12:27.130
AND FOR SURFACE-CRAWLERS
LIKE YOU

12:27.130 --> 12:29.200
WHO DON'T GET THE MESSAGE,

12:29.200 --> 12:32.170
GET A LOAD OF THIS MUTATION!

12:40.310 --> 12:43.180
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS CELL
CAME WITH ENTERTAINMENT.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.450
YOU GUYS ARE
A REGULAR FREAK SHOW.

12:45.450 --> 12:47.220
HEY, WHAT'S THE ENCORE, HUH?

12:47.220 --> 12:49.250
OH, YOU WANT AN ENCORE?

12:49.250 --> 12:53.190
SHOW BUNNY-BOY
WHAT WE CAN DO, FELLAS.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.390
AAH! OW!

13:00.060 --> 13:05.070
YOU REALIZE, FISH-FACE,
THAT THIS MEANS WAR.

13:05.070 --> 13:06.240
HUH?

13:07.400 --> 13:08.500
HAH!

13:08.500 --> 13:09.570
OW!

13:09.570 --> 13:12.880
YOU MAY HAVE
SOME NIFTY TRICKS,
BIG-EARS,

13:12.880 --> 13:15.640
BUT YOU GOTTA PLAY
BY MY RULES NOW.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.050
UNH! SOMEBODY
NEEDS A TIME-OUT.

13:24.050 --> 13:25.750
COME ON, FELLAS.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.260
WE GOT A WORLD TO SINK.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.930
UNH! UHH! OHH...

13:34.830 --> 13:36.830
Rev: I'M NOT PICKING UP
ANYTHING ON SONAR
OTHER THAN A WHOLE BUNCH

13:36.830 --> 13:39.270
OF REALLY COOL SEA ANEMONES
AND A BUNCH OF SLIMY
BOTTOM-FEEDERS,

13:39.270 --> 13:41.400
BUT CERTAINLY NOT ANYTHING
REMOTELY RESEMBLING
A RABBIT.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.370
QUIET DOWN, REV,
AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

13:43.370 --> 13:45.240
THOSE WHALES ARE BACK,
AND THEY'RE FORMING

13:45.240 --> 13:47.640
A WHIRLPOOL
AROUND THAT ISLAND.

13:47.640 --> 13:48.980
CORRECTION. WHAT ISLAND?

13:53.050 --> 13:54.950
AND NOW THEY'RE
AFTER ACMETROPOLIS CITY.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.350
WE'VE GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE

13:57.350 --> 13:59.690
BEFORE THAT WHIRLPOOL
GETS ANY BIGGER.

13:59.690 --> 14:02.560
All: AAAHHH!

14:02.560 --> 14:04.430
Lexi: TOO LATE!

14:23.210 --> 14:26.020
UNH! WE NEED MORE POWER!

14:26.020 --> 14:28.450
HOW ABOUT THIS?

14:31.820 --> 14:34.290
AQUA DENSE!

14:53.140 --> 14:55.510
All: WUAAAAAHH!

15:02.790 --> 15:04.020
WELL, THAT WAS CLOSE.

15:04.020 --> 15:06.220
LEXI, YOU AND I
HAD BETTER FIND ACE PRONTO

15:06.220 --> 15:08.490
WHILE YOU OTHER GUYS
TRY TO STOP THOSE WHALES.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.930
OK, LET'S GO,
WATERBOY.

15:11.930 --> 15:13.660
I DON'T KNOW
WHO GOT THE TOUGHER JOB,
AND HOW ARE WE GONNA STOP

15:13.660 --> 15:15.760
ALL THOSE WHALES
WHEN THEY'RE REALLY,
REALLY HUGE

15:15.760 --> 15:18.630
AND WE'RE REALLY, REALLY
TINY? NOT TO MENTION THEY
GOT US WAY OUTNUMBERED.

15:18.630 --> 15:21.670
THE ONLY FEASIBLE
METHODOLOGY FOR
NEUTRALIZING THAT VORTEX

15:21.670 --> 15:25.840
IS TO ESTABLISH
A COUNTERVEILING TRAJECTORY
AT THE PERIMETER.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.140
UH, WHAT'D HE SAY?

15:27.140 --> 15:28.540
WE HAVE TO SPIN
THE OTHER WAY.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.150
OH, YEAH. I GET IT.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.130
RRAHNNGGH!

15:51.370 --> 15:53.040
HA HA HA!

16:02.950 --> 16:05.150
BYE-BYE, BIRDIE.

16:13.790 --> 16:14.960
HA HA HA!

16:16.060 --> 16:17.990
WHOA-OA-OA!
HA HA HA! WHOA!

16:17.990 --> 16:19.330
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
HA HA!

16:23.030 --> 16:24.400
RRAAAHHHH!

16:24.400 --> 16:25.630
HAH!

16:26.400 --> 16:28.670
WAAAAAAHH!

16:31.440 --> 16:32.710
HUAAAAH!

16:33.440 --> 16:36.210
HO! HYAAH!

16:37.380 --> 16:39.080
UNNGGGHHH!

16:45.950 --> 16:48.160
OOOHH-OO!

16:50.790 --> 16:54.060
Lexi: HMM, LOOKS LIKE
ONE OF THE CABINS
IS STILL OCCUPIED.

16:54.060 --> 16:55.360
I'M GOIN' IN.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.430
GET READY TO FIRE UP
THAT BRAIN OF YOURS.

16:57.430 --> 16:58.630
DUCK, FOR THE LAST TIME.

16:58.630 --> 17:01.940
I CAN'T FOCUS
MY BRAIN BLAST DOWN HERE.

17:01.940 --> 17:03.240
I KNOW 2 THINGS.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.010
ONE, MY POWERS ARE DIFFERENT
DOWN HERE,

17:05.010 --> 17:07.480
SO MAYBE YOUR POWERS
ARE DIFFERENT, TOO.

17:07.480 --> 17:08.480
AND SECONDLY,

17:08.480 --> 17:10.080
I'M THE BETTER-LOOKING ONE.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.050
SO LET'S GO SAVE ACE!

17:12.050 --> 17:13.480
OHH.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.120
DUCK, WAIT!

17:17.350 --> 17:19.590
ACE, I'M HERE!
DUCK?

17:19.590 --> 17:22.360
WE'VE COME TO GET YOU OUT
OF THIS--THIS, UH..

17:22.360 --> 17:25.060
WHA-HA-HA! GIANT JELLYFISH!

17:25.060 --> 17:26.460
UNH! AAH!

17:26.460 --> 17:29.330
I CAN'T QUACK.
CAN'T--OH!

17:32.270 --> 17:35.670
LEXI! HUNH!
BRAIN BLAST!

17:35.670 --> 17:37.470
USE YOUR BRAIN BLAST!

17:37.470 --> 17:40.940
OK, BUT YOU'LL BE SORRY.

17:40.940 --> 17:42.110
UNH!

17:43.180 --> 17:45.080
Ace and Duck: WHOA!

17:45.080 --> 17:46.250
HUAH!

17:48.180 --> 17:49.590
ACE! DUCK!

17:49.590 --> 17:51.090
YOU GUYS OK?

17:51.090 --> 17:53.660
Ace: MAYBE. MAYBE NOT.

17:53.660 --> 17:56.790
AHA! AQUA DENSE!

18:02.630 --> 18:04.230
DUCK! YOU GOT HIM!

18:04.230 --> 18:05.370
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SAY

18:05.370 --> 18:07.400
I'M BRAVE, HANDSOME,
AND BRILLIANT,

18:07.400 --> 18:09.640
BUT THEN AGAIN,
WHY BE MODEST?

18:09.640 --> 18:12.740
AND LEXI SHORT-CIRCUITED
THEIR MIND CONTROL.

18:12.740 --> 18:15.110
YOU GUYS SHOULD
TEAM UP MORE OFTEN.

18:17.550 --> 18:20.450
BRING THE DIRT-DWELLERS
DOWN!

18:20.450 --> 18:23.390
Ace: LET'S JET.
WE GOTTA STOP ADOLPHO.

18:23.390 --> 18:25.790
HE'S GONNA TAKE DOWN
THIS CITY.

18:34.660 --> 18:36.500
WE'RE BACK.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.730
GOOD. WE NEED ALL THE HELP
WE CAN GET.

18:38.730 --> 18:40.740
WHERE'S REV AND SLAM?

18:40.740 --> 18:42.670
AH-HA HA. WHALE FOOD.

18:42.670 --> 18:45.440
YOU HEARD THE COYOTE.
THEY NEED US.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.140
WE'RE A TEAM, REMEMBER?
COME ON!

18:47.140 --> 18:49.280
HEY! WATCH THE SUIT!

18:56.750 --> 19:00.790
COME ON, FELLAS.
WE GOT A WORLD TO SINK.

19:00.790 --> 19:05.560
COME ON, PARTNER!
WE GOT A WORLD TO SAVE!

19:05.560 --> 19:06.630
READY?

19:06.630 --> 19:08.230
READY!

19:33.560 --> 19:34.860
NOW, LEX!

19:48.540 --> 19:49.340
HUH?

19:51.040 --> 19:55.210
WHAT? YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
A DUCK RIDE A DOLPHIN
BEFORE?

19:55.210 --> 19:56.450
Both: UH...

20:00.580 --> 20:05.420
HEY. THAT BUNNY
KNOCKED OUT MY SIGNAL.

20:05.420 --> 20:08.420
THIS IS MAKING ME
VERY UPSET!

20:09.530 --> 20:11.290
Tech: ACE, I'VE LOCKED
OUR COMMUNICATORS

20:11.290 --> 20:12.630
ONTO THE WHALES' FREQUENCY.

20:12.630 --> 20:13.700
OK, MOBY.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.560
NOW THAT THAT DOLPHIN'S
MIND GAMES ARE OVER,

20:15.560 --> 20:18.270
HOW ABOUT COUGHING UP
OUR PALS?

20:19.970 --> 20:21.000
WAAAAAAHH!

20:21.000 --> 20:22.710
HOO-HOO, HA--UNH!

20:27.340 --> 20:29.650
UNGH! HUAHH!

20:30.480 --> 20:33.280
HEY! THIS ISN'T
PART OF THE PLAN.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.620
YOU GOTTA PLAY
BY OUR RULES NOW.

20:34.620 --> 20:35.580
UHH...

20:35.580 --> 20:37.090
THAT WAS REALLY WILD!
I FELT JUST LIKE

20:37.090 --> 20:38.690
PINOCCHIO IN THERE.
DID YOU SEE THE SIZE
OF HIS TONGUE?

20:38.690 --> 20:40.420
I BET WHEN HE'S TONGUE-TIED,
IT'S A REALLY HUGE KNOT.

20:40.420 --> 20:42.860
IT'S A TONGUE UNTO ITSELF,
WHICH IS SOME TONGUE
IF THERE WAS A TONGUE

20:42.860 --> 20:44.890
THAT WAS SUCH A TONGUE
THAT I'D BE TONGUE-TIED
TO EVEN TALK ABOUT A TONGUE

20:44.890 --> 20:47.200
LIKE THAT, WHICH MAKES ME
SO NERVOUS, I THINK
THE CAT'S GOT MY TONGUE.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.870
WHICH MAKES ME WONDER
WHY IT'S THE CAT
AND NOT THE BAT OR THE DOG

20:49.870 --> 20:51.930
OR THE RAT. AND WHAT
DO THEY DO WITH THE TONGUE
WHEN THEY GET IT...

20:51.930 --> 20:58.740
Adolpho: OH, I DESPISE
YOU SURFACE, DIRT-CRAWLING
SLIMY PUS FACES!

20:58.740 --> 21:02.310
YOU MAKE MY FINS CRAWL!
FURRY FREAKS!

21:02.310 --> 21:03.680
LET ME OUT
OF THIS FISHBOWL.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.520
MM. IT'S KINDA CRAMPED
IN THERE, ISN'T IT?

21:06.520 --> 21:09.550
YOU LISTENING TO ME,
FUR

21:09.550 --> 21:13.160
UH-UH. BUT MAYBE
THIS'LL HELP.

21:18.730 --> 21:22.230
SORRY. DON'T SPEAK FIN.
