WEBVTT

00:00.178 --> 00:02.271
Matt, I promise,
you will not be disappointed.

00:02.347 --> 00:04.247
My dad makes the best breakfast
in Queens.

00:04.282 --> 00:05.306
Great.

00:05.383 --> 00:07.442
Well, not just Queens. All of New York.

00:07.518 --> 00:09.645
You haven't had breakfast
at the Four Seasons.

00:09.687 --> 00:10.711
Neither have you.

00:10.755 --> 00:13.348
I just know everything they do
is first-class.

00:13.390 --> 00:15.017
- Tell them, Matt. You're rich.
- Justin!

00:15.058 --> 00:17.083
No, it's okay.
I have had brunch there a few times.

00:17.127 --> 00:21.359
<i>Matt, you are going to love my
Guadalajara Scramble Espectacular.</i>

00:21.398 --> 00:23.730
Mmm.
- I dream about eating these.

00:23.767 --> 00:26.065
Mmm-hmm.
And you'll keep dreaming.

00:26.103 --> 00:29.834
Only grapefruit and egg whites for you
this morning, mister.

00:29.873 --> 00:30.931
Hot!

00:34.411 --> 00:36.436
<i>Mi hija, where's the fire?</i>

00:36.513 --> 00:37.809
Slow down.

00:37.847 --> 00:40.748
- I have to meet Daniel at the office.
- On a Saturday?

00:40.783 --> 00:43.445
He's working so hard to keep
this company from sinking.

00:43.486 --> 00:45.954
And besides, Matt and I are going
to a Ranger game today.

00:45.988 --> 00:47.455
- Wow.
I don't get hockey.

00:47.490 --> 00:49.321
All that ice,
and no one's figure skating?

00:49.358 --> 00:50.916
Betty, I didn't even know
you liked hockey.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.860
No, she doesn't, actually.
I have to go for work, and...

00:52.895 --> 00:56.524
And I owe him. He stayed in my office
for, like, an hour when I worked late.

00:56.565 --> 01:00.797
<i>Yeah, I read every issue of Mode
over the last three years. A lot of boobs.</i>

01:00.836 --> 01:03.395
I'm just saying. Don't forget
to meet me at my mom's place.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.303
I'm staying there
while they fix my apartment.

01:05.340 --> 01:07.831
Moms love Betty. They don't love me.

01:07.909 --> 01:09.706
Actually, we haven't even met yet.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.440
Well, she's away.
But she is dying to meet Betty.

01:12.514 --> 01:14.539
She says Betty sounds like
the daughter she never had.

01:15.717 --> 01:17.548
It's at 2921 Madison Avenue.

01:17.585 --> 01:19.746
- What apartment?
- The whole building.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.348
How rich are you?
How much money do you have?

01:22.390 --> 01:24.017
Justin! Hilda!

01:24.059 --> 01:25.686
Anybody home?
- Oh!

01:25.727 --> 01:29.822
Crap. I forgot I have
a haircut appointment. Hi, Archie!

01:29.863 --> 01:31.421
Hi.
- That's the councilman?

01:31.465 --> 01:32.955
Yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.298
Please come in, Your Excellency.

01:35.335 --> 01:37.803
Ignacio, I keep telling you,
please just call me Archie.

01:37.838 --> 01:42.400
No, sir, let me have your coat, stay
and eat, then you can have a haircut.

01:43.744 --> 01:46.713
- He's cute, Hilda.
- And he's single. And he likes her.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.680
That's why he comes here every week
to get his hair cut.

01:48.716 --> 01:49.774
- Go out with him.
- Yeah!

01:49.817 --> 01:52.377
I don't know.
He's nice, but he's missing something.

01:52.419 --> 01:54.682
What, a wedding ring?
Like your last boyfriend?

01:54.721 --> 01:56.188
Oh, no.

01:56.222 --> 01:58.713
Okay, I'm leaving. Have fun.

01:58.758 --> 02:00.658
- Behave!
Okay.

02:00.693 --> 02:03.526
Hilda, he's a nice guy,
give him a chance.

02:04.864 --> 02:06.092
- Don't!
- Don't.

02:07.767 --> 02:11.396
You're crazy.
Derek Jeter is a good-looking guy.

02:11.437 --> 02:13.302
Sorry, but he doesn't do it for me.

02:13.372 --> 02:15.340
Are you kidding me?
That guy gets so much...

02:15.408 --> 02:16.898
Don't be gross.

02:16.976 --> 02:20.809
...fun. That guy gets so much fun,
you wouldn't believe it.

02:20.846 --> 02:22.711
I like fun.

02:22.748 --> 02:24.909
I hate that you have to go
to work on a Saturday.

02:24.950 --> 02:27.077
<i>I know, but until Mode
gets back on its feet,</i>

02:27.119 --> 02:29.246
- it's gonna be seven days a week.
- You know, when you're gone,

02:29.287 --> 02:31.255
I think I'll take a little hike
in Prospect Park.

02:31.289 --> 02:34.053
Whoa, whoa, no, no, no, no. Hey.

02:34.092 --> 02:36.060
Look, why don't you just hang out?

02:36.094 --> 02:38.892
I'll bring you some soup.
Watch TV, you can stay warm...

02:38.930 --> 02:40.056
I have cancer, Daniel.

02:40.098 --> 02:42.566
It's not like a bowl of soup and a nap,
and I'll be over it.

02:44.368 --> 02:46.563
Look, will you do it for me?

02:47.872 --> 02:49.100
Please?

02:52.009 --> 02:53.101
Okay.

02:57.081 --> 02:58.571
Your meeting with Miles Foster
is at 4:00.

02:58.616 --> 03:01.312
Wilhelmina's on the way, I put out
a spread in the conference room.

03:01.352 --> 03:04.981
Cheese, olives, salami,
not the kind that makes you gassy.

03:05.022 --> 03:06.717
Betty, that was once. It was a fluke.

03:06.757 --> 03:08.280
Yeah, I wouldn't risk it.

03:08.324 --> 03:11.122
Also, great news,
the doctor you want for Molly is

03:11.161 --> 03:13.254
in town for the rest of the week.
Here's his number.

03:13.296 --> 03:15.628
Dr. Simon? That's fantastic!

03:15.665 --> 03:17.257
Betty, thank you so much
for everything today.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.460
I know you're not getting paid...

03:18.501 --> 03:21.629
Stop, Daniel.
If you need my help, I'm always here.

03:21.704 --> 03:23.365
And you get to go meet
your boyfriend right now.

03:23.439 --> 03:25.771
Matt is not my boyfriend.

03:25.809 --> 03:28.004
If I've learned one thing
from Molly's illness,

03:28.044 --> 03:31.013
it's that if you have something good,
you have to enjoy it.

03:31.080 --> 03:34.173
I am enjoying it.
I just don't want to put a label on it.

03:34.216 --> 03:37.811
You know, what's the point? Boyfriend,
girlfriend, what does that mean?

03:37.853 --> 03:40.378
I think it means
you're getting serious.

03:40.422 --> 03:44.620
Daniel, all I'm thinking about right now
is going to a hockey game.

03:44.660 --> 03:45.684
Go Rangers!

03:47.729 --> 03:51.688
So, I learned Miles has wall-to-wall
meetings with every editor in town.

03:51.733 --> 03:55.669
Well, no surprise. Whenever he shoots
a cover, issues fly off the newsstands.

03:55.704 --> 03:57.695
I know. We get him first, though,
we have a good chance.

03:57.773 --> 03:59.239
I'm afraid we can't afford him.

03:59.307 --> 04:02.140
I know. He costs more
than our entire photo budget.

04:02.176 --> 04:06.010
Well, let's make it tasty.
Promise him complete creative control.

04:06.047 --> 04:08.572
Yeah, great, make him want us
more than we want him?

04:08.616 --> 04:10.447
Just make sure you play it cool in there.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.712
I always play it cool.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.152
Well, right now you've got
that upper lip sweat you get

04:14.188 --> 04:15.815
when you're desperate.

04:15.857 --> 04:18.620
It's water! I just washed my face.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.422
If that's what you say.

04:20.461 --> 04:23.623
We've got a lot riding on this,
so let's make it happen.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.994
<i>Miles, it is so great
to have you here at Mode.</i>

04:31.071 --> 04:33.062
We are such fans of your work.

04:33.139 --> 04:35.266
That Brady Bunch-inspired shoot
you did

04:35.308 --> 04:38.641
with Brad and Angelina
and the six kids, genius.

04:38.678 --> 04:41.340
How on earth did you get
Jennifer Aniston to play Alice?

04:41.381 --> 04:45.408
I don't know what's hip or cool,
I just take pictures.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.750
I'm trying to do something
that makes me feel happy inside.

04:48.787 --> 04:52.587
Well, Wilhelmina and I would certainly
love to make you feel happy inside.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.185
- Daniel...
- Sorry. Did that sound weird?

04:55.227 --> 04:58.128
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, yeah. No worries.

04:58.163 --> 05:00.131
This all sounds good. Let's do it.

05:00.165 --> 05:03.566
And you will have complete creative
control, with no editorial interference.

05:03.602 --> 05:04.626
Fantastic.

05:04.703 --> 05:07.035
And we appreciate
you taking a cut in your fee.

05:07.072 --> 05:08.539
And it's off.

05:11.243 --> 05:14.336
You do understand
that we're in a bit of a crunch.

05:14.379 --> 05:15.539
So I have to suffer?

05:15.580 --> 05:16.706
Mmm-mmm. Sorry.

05:16.748 --> 05:19.546
I'm a frigging genius, man.
You said it yourself.

05:19.584 --> 05:22.781
<i>I can go down the block to Vanity Fair,
and they'll pay my fee.</i>

05:22.820 --> 05:24.754
So listen, you have until Friday.

05:24.789 --> 05:27.189
If you have the money,
I'll sign the contract.

05:27.225 --> 05:29.056
<i>And if not, sayonara.</i>

05:33.097 --> 05:34.496
We need him.

05:34.565 --> 05:35.827
Yes, we do.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.391
So this is going to have
to come out of our own pocket.

05:40.904 --> 05:44.032
Wilhelmina, if you want,
I can cover this.

05:44.074 --> 05:47.510
No, that won't be necessary.
I'll cover my half.

05:47.544 --> 05:50.741
Come on,
I have more resources than you.

05:50.781 --> 05:51.873
How about I pay?

05:51.915 --> 05:55.043
How about you worry about your end,
and I'll worry about mine?

05:55.085 --> 05:57.315
Okay? I got this. No problem.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.074

06:12.902 --> 06:14.836
Hello?

06:14.870 --> 06:17.031
Matt? Hello?

06:17.073 --> 06:19.200
Matt? Hello.

06:19.742 --> 06:21.801
Oh, good. Someone's here.

06:22.812 --> 06:26.771
I'm back early, I left my bags
by the service entrance,

06:26.816 --> 06:29.477
if you could go and bring them in.

06:29.517 --> 06:32.042
Hi. I'm Betty.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.783
Victoria Hartley.
I didn't realize you were new.

06:34.823 --> 06:37.792
But I'm very good with names,
I won't forget.

06:38.393 --> 06:39.690
You'll enjoy it here.

06:39.728 --> 06:43.789
The first Monday of every month,
I give away my old shoes.

06:43.865 --> 06:47.596
Oh, no. I'm Betty Suarez.

06:48.370 --> 06:50.031
I'm dating Matt.

06:52.874 --> 06:54.363
Really?

06:54.408 --> 06:55.705
Mom, you're home.

06:55.743 --> 06:58.405
Yes, I caught an early flight.

06:58.445 --> 07:01.608
And Betty's here. Have you guys met?

07:01.648 --> 07:04.242
Betty, Mom. Mom, Betty.

07:06.487 --> 07:12.084
Super. Let's head on out.
Not you, Mom. Maybe next time.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.453
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Hartley.

07:15.529 --> 07:18.622
Yes. And nice to meet you.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.707
Dying to meet me?
Matt, she didn't even know who I was!

07:36.749 --> 07:37.807
She thought I was your maid!

07:37.850 --> 07:39.374
I know, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

07:39.419 --> 07:42.286
Well, why did you tell me that I was
the daughter she wished she'd had?

07:42.321 --> 07:43.617
Yeah, I don't know
why I added that detail.

07:43.655 --> 07:45.748
It's weird.
Especially since I have a sister.

07:45.791 --> 07:46.985
- What?
- Look, no, I don't have a sister.

07:47.059 --> 07:48.117
It's a bad joke.

07:48.193 --> 07:50.423
So what, were you,
like, hiding me from her?

07:50.495 --> 07:52.793
No! I was hiding her from you.

07:52.831 --> 07:56.062
Look, my mom is tricky, Betty.
She's judgmental and controlling,

07:56.101 --> 07:58.592
and no one I date is
ever good enough for her.

07:58.637 --> 08:00.696
Well, then why didn't you
just tell me that?

08:00.739 --> 08:04.869
Moms love me, Matt. She'll love me.
She just has to get to know me.

08:04.910 --> 08:07.970
I just didn't wanna have to put you
through the Victoria Hartley taste test.

08:08.012 --> 08:10.480
But you have to put me through
the Victoria Hartley taste test.

08:10.514 --> 08:11.572
She's your mother.

08:11.615 --> 08:14.379
And if my family didn't like the taste
of someone I was dating,

08:14.418 --> 08:15.851
well, then that would matter.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.979
- Can we drop the whole taste thing?
- Yeah, let's.

08:18.022 --> 08:21.253
Look, I'm just saying,
it matters if your mom likes me.

08:21.325 --> 08:25.352
It matters for us, you know?
When can I meet her again?

08:26.397 --> 08:29.264
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I can handle anything.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.462
Dinner, lunch, coffee.
I'm really good at coffee.

08:32.503 --> 08:36.029
How about a party?
She's having this thing on Friday night.

08:36.072 --> 08:38.734
- Hmm. I didn't get an invitation.
- Okay, okay, okay.

08:38.775 --> 08:42.107
Would you like to go to a party with me
at my mother's apartment Friday night?

08:42.145 --> 08:45.603
Ooh! Friday? I think I have
an online Scrabble tournament.

08:45.648 --> 08:48.310
I'm just kidding! Yes. Let's do it.

08:48.585 --> 08:52.146
You're the best,
you know that?

08:52.956 --> 08:56.050
Okay, let's go,
I don't want to be late for the game.

08:56.126 --> 08:58.491
- Keep the change, buddy.
- Thanks.

09:06.702 --> 09:08.829
Willie! Selling your possessions?

09:08.871 --> 09:11.806
Isn't that like one rung above appearing
on a reality show?

09:11.840 --> 09:14.570
I have to, Marc.
It's not just that photographer.

09:14.610 --> 09:16.544
Running Meade costs a fortune.

09:16.578 --> 09:19.479
And I can't let Daniel leverage me
out of the company.

09:19.515 --> 09:21.710
- But you're rich.
- In certain things.

09:21.750 --> 09:26.482
Real estate, clothing, attitude.
But Daniel has cash. And I don't.

09:26.521 --> 09:28.716
Your taste is extraordinary, Miss Slater.

09:28.789 --> 09:31.155
- I know.
- That sable is spectacular.

09:31.192 --> 09:34.127
- Is the lining hand-stitched?
- Oh, yes.

09:34.162 --> 09:37.825
By a seamstress from Paris
whose great-great-grandfather

09:37.865 --> 09:39.890
was furrier to Napoleon.

09:42.670 --> 09:46.162
- Wow! Really?
- How the hell should I know?

09:46.207 --> 09:48.697
Hey, why can't you just ask
one of your rich friends for money,

09:48.742 --> 09:51.176
like the Donald or Sumner or Martha?

09:51.211 --> 09:53.202
And have one of those bitches
own me?

09:53.246 --> 09:55.612
No way. My money, my equity.

09:55.649 --> 09:59.415
Wow, you are like
the world's sexiest economics teacher.

09:59.452 --> 10:02.615
Marc, if I panic now,
I will lose everything.

10:02.689 --> 10:06.125
So with a few short-term cutbacks here
and at the office, I'll be fine.

10:06.159 --> 10:07.183
Miss Slater, may I?

10:07.260 --> 10:10.889
Let's cut the Bryn Mawr niceties, okay?
Do you want my things or not?

10:10.931 --> 10:15.663
We do. Don't worry, Miss Slater.
We're very discreet.

10:15.701 --> 10:16.827
Good.

10:16.869 --> 10:19.133
Come back on Friday with a check
for the down payment.

10:25.010 --> 10:28.309
Oh! For God's sake, Marc, stop crying.

10:28.347 --> 10:32.681
If you'd like,
you may try on the sable one last time.

10:32.718 --> 10:33.844
Huh?

10:39.424 --> 10:42.120
Hey, Betty,
a little bird told me about

10:42.160 --> 10:44.253
your fancy dinner
with your rich boyfriend.

10:44.295 --> 10:47.162
Oh! Was the little bird looking
at the calendar on my desk?

10:47.198 --> 10:50.463
Well, what am I supposed to do?
You never open up to me anymore.

10:50.501 --> 10:52.264
When we were roomies,
we shared everything.

10:52.303 --> 10:56.205
No, Amanda. You shared everything.
And some of it was weird.

10:56.241 --> 10:59.369
You know, B, you are playing
this Matt thing perfectly.

10:59.410 --> 11:02.436
A few more moves, and you will
be in the gold-digger hall of fame.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.812
I'm not a gold-digger!
I could care less about Matt's money.

11:05.849 --> 11:09.046
And cut, print, Oscar.
Don't change a word. You nailed it.

11:09.119 --> 11:13.021
Amanda, I really like Matt,
and he likes me.

11:13.056 --> 11:15.786
And now I just need his mom
to like me.

11:18.695 --> 11:20.663
The show was tragic,

11:20.697 --> 11:23.825
but if I know Henri,
he'll be back on top in no time.

11:25.402 --> 11:28.131
Excuse me. Marc! It's 4:00!

11:28.804 --> 11:32.740
I'm sorry. It's time for
my afternoon caviar and champagne.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.902
I'll have to call you back.

11:44.287 --> 11:48.155
Good grief, what the hell is this? Marc!

11:51.460 --> 11:52.688
What is this?

11:52.728 --> 11:55.992
It's an almond, and that's seltzer.

11:57.632 --> 11:59.759
Where is the beluga?
Where's the Krug?

11:59.801 --> 12:02.269
We can't afford it
with our new office budget.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.862
I was worried
that you might react this way,

12:03.905 --> 12:07.102
but, remember, you said
that you wanted to make sacrifices.

12:07.142 --> 12:11.010
You're right. You're right.
This is exactly what I was talking about.

12:11.046 --> 12:15.881
It's what we need.
So, almonds, you said?

12:15.950 --> 12:19.715
Yes. Almonds.

12:21.922 --> 12:23.219
Mmm.

12:23.257 --> 12:25.350
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

12:25.392 --> 12:28.020
I'm fine. I have everything I need.

12:36.537 --> 12:39.506
So, eight years ago,
Molly was diagnosed.

12:39.540 --> 12:41.132
They didn't catch it early.

12:41.175 --> 12:43.233
Yes, I can see the cancer was
rather advanced.

12:43.276 --> 12:45.005
That's why the treatment was
so aggressive.

12:45.044 --> 12:47.239
But it worked.
I mean, look at her. She's healthy.

12:48.414 --> 12:52.441
Listen, all that matters is her ability
to respond to my treatment.

12:52.518 --> 12:54.782
And based on what I'm seeing,

12:56.055 --> 12:58.751
there's only a small chance.

12:58.791 --> 13:00.691
But it is a chance.

13:00.727 --> 13:03.753
I'm about to begin work
on a new clinical study.

13:03.796 --> 13:06.959
I will send the information to your office.
You'll let me know what you wanna do.

13:06.999 --> 13:08.693
Can we have a couple of days
to think about it?

13:08.734 --> 13:11.532
Molly, no. Dr. Simon,
we don't need to take a few days.

13:11.570 --> 13:13.800
We have our answer. We're in.

13:18.076 --> 13:22.035
Mrs. Meade, I was wondering
if you could help me with something.

13:22.080 --> 13:25.345
Oh, you're worried
about Victoria Hartley's party.

13:25.417 --> 13:27.214
- Daniel told you?
- He tells me everything.

13:27.252 --> 13:31.154
Oh! By the way, Hilda should totally
go out with that councilman.

13:31.189 --> 13:34.817
- So, you know Mrs. Hartley?
- Oh, yes.

13:34.859 --> 13:38.056
See, I've never been to anything
this fancy. What do I need to know?

13:38.095 --> 13:39.153
Oh, Betty, please.

13:39.196 --> 13:41.255
- You know which fork to use.
- Outside in.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.163
- And the bread plate is on...
- My left.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.361
- And the big glass is for...
- Red wine!

13:45.403 --> 13:48.702
- You're fine. What's the topic?
- A topic?

13:48.739 --> 13:51.833
All these East Side cows
always have a topic of conversation

13:51.876 --> 13:53.776
they like to introduce during the meal.

13:53.844 --> 13:57.007
Last week,
mine was the Romanov dynasty.

13:57.081 --> 13:58.672
Oh, no, I don't know what the topic is.

13:58.748 --> 14:00.511
What if it's something
that I know nothing about?

14:00.550 --> 14:02.017
- Do you have the phone number?
- Yes.

14:02.085 --> 14:05.350
Dial it.
We'll get one of the maids to tell us.

14:05.388 --> 14:07.788
Oh! That's a great idea. Okay.

14:10.126 --> 14:13.095
Hello. Yes, may I please speak
to Consuela?

14:14.030 --> 14:16.089
There's always a Consuela.

14:23.639 --> 14:24.765
That's all I got. You're up.

14:24.807 --> 14:26.172
Oh. Um...

14:45.661 --> 14:48.720
Torture!
The topic is torture! Isn't that great?

14:48.763 --> 14:51.254
It's a little obvious.

14:51.299 --> 14:56.396
Arianna did torture at her luncheon
last year. We water-boarded Liz Smith.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.371
<i>I just read this article
in the New Republic</i>

14:58.406 --> 15:00.397
about the ethics of torture.

15:01.108 --> 15:04.077
I'm so happy! Thank you.

15:05.179 --> 15:06.612
I'm so glad.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.540
Hey, Willie, I just got a bulletin
from Engineering,

15:09.617 --> 15:10.743
all the TVs need to be turned off.

15:10.785 --> 15:11.911
They're doing some sort of test
or something.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.182
No computers either, there's a virus
going around or something.

15:14.221 --> 15:15.882
- Marc, what is going on?
- Nothing!

15:15.922 --> 15:17.890
It's just tech stuff,
it's completely normal.

15:17.924 --> 15:20.017
Don't read any papers tomorrow.
Bad ink.

15:20.060 --> 15:21.687
Don't make me hit you.

15:21.728 --> 15:24.891
<i>Okay. I got a call
from my source at Fashion Buzz,</i>

15:24.931 --> 15:28.025
and there's a story going around that
might have something to do with you.

15:33.073 --> 15:35.132
<i>But I've saved
the best piece of gossip</i>

15:35.208 --> 15:37.472
<i>masquerading as news for last.</i>

15:37.544 --> 15:39.704
<i>Which fabulous fashion world editor,</i>

15:39.778 --> 15:42.474
<i>Mode-ivated
by a recent reversal of fortune,</i>

15:42.515 --> 15:45.746
<i>has begun to sell off her clothes
Willie-nilly?</i>

15:45.784 --> 15:48.548
<i>And this tidbit positively Slater-ed me,</i>

15:48.587 --> 15:50.953
<i>her daily snack is now
a healthy combination</i>

15:50.990 --> 15:55.086
<i>of food stamp-friendly nuts
and soda water!</i>

15:55.127 --> 15:58.153
<i>It's all so delicious and humiliating.</i>

15:58.197 --> 16:01.325
I'd tell you more, but I'm on my way out
to a local thrift store

16:01.367 --> 16:04.301
to purchase one of Wilhelmina Slater's
former possessions.

16:04.335 --> 16:05.427
Oops!

16:05.470 --> 16:08.234
Did I say her name? I'm sorry.

16:08.306 --> 16:10.968
Because you know I'd never
mock someone when they're down.

16:15.747 --> 16:19.183
I have no idea how it got out.
I swear I didn't tell anyone.

16:20.785 --> 16:22.480
It's fine, Marc.

16:23.988 --> 16:25.580
Obviously, there's a mole
here somewhere.

16:25.623 --> 16:29.251
And I promise you I will find it,
and I will have it removed.

16:29.293 --> 16:32.456
Cancel my calls and meetings.
I'm done for the day.

16:32.496 --> 16:34.828
- Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm fine.

16:34.865 --> 16:36.992
- Willie...
- I said I'm fine!

16:43.941 --> 16:47.707
There are some who would argue
that under certain circumstances,

16:47.744 --> 16:50.110
torture is permissible,
but others would say...

16:50.147 --> 16:53.479
Ow! Justin, that is tight!

16:53.516 --> 16:55.541
Don't you wanna look good
for Matt's mom?

16:55.585 --> 16:56.643
Yes.

16:56.686 --> 17:00.622
Well, this is one of those instances
where torture is necessary.

17:01.457 --> 17:03.220
Good luck.

17:03.259 --> 17:06.694
Elena, that's one too many plates.
Remember, Betty's leaving.

17:06.729 --> 17:09.527
- That's all right. Just leave it.
- No, I'll take it into the kitchen.

17:09.565 --> 17:11.657
- No, no, don't bother.
- It's no bother.

17:13.102 --> 17:14.797
What is going on?

17:15.605 --> 17:18.073
Hilda, remember
how you asked me to let you know

17:18.140 --> 17:19.503
when you do that thing
with your eyebrows

17:19.540 --> 17:22.066
that makes you look like Son of Sam?

17:24.546 --> 17:27.606
Hey, everyone.
Thanks so much for having me over.

17:27.648 --> 17:30.709
- Hey, Archie. Great to see you.
- Councilman!

17:32.053 --> 17:33.350
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

17:33.388 --> 17:34.753
Here, here, take the wine.

17:34.789 --> 17:37.553
- Thank you.
- It's so good to see you. Come on in.

17:37.592 --> 17:40.083
- Bye, Hilda.
- Uh-uh. I am gonna get you for this.

17:40.128 --> 17:43.029
Oh, come on, Hilda.
Try and have a good time.

17:43.064 --> 17:46.157
Archie is great.
You deserve a good guy.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.574
Willie.

18:00.547 --> 18:04.313
Willie, the auction house people
are here to do the pickup.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.415
One second.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.487
Willie?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.158
Wilhelmina, are you here?

18:36.815 --> 18:38.248
Hello, Marc.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.082
Thank you for coming tonight.

18:47.125 --> 18:50.219
You know what?
I am not happy about this.

18:50.262 --> 18:53.925
Come on, just give him a chance.

18:53.965 --> 18:57.560
I hope you're hungry! Because
Ignacio's been cooking up a storm.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.069
Well, I can't tell you how good it is
to get a home-cooked meal.

19:00.137 --> 19:02.503
Really, thank you so much
for having me over.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.201
Please. You must be
always having dinner

19:04.241 --> 19:07.608
with mayors and governors
and princes and bishops.

19:07.645 --> 19:10.876
It's more like Chinese takeout
alone in my apartment, really.

19:10.915 --> 19:14.373
So modest. The man's a celebrity
and he's so modest.

19:14.418 --> 19:16.648
<i>Papi,
he's a Queens councilman,</i>

19:16.687 --> 19:17.984
he's not Justin Timberlake.

19:19.457 --> 19:23.052
Thank you, Hilda,
for keeping my feet on the ground.

19:23.094 --> 19:25.527
You see that?
Hilda could be good for you.

19:25.562 --> 19:26.654
Hey.

19:27.797 --> 19:29.731
Excuse us for a second.

19:32.102 --> 19:35.299
- Stop scowling.
- I don't like surprises, Elena.

19:35.872 --> 19:38.602
Mom, here's your medication.

19:58.393 --> 20:00.054
- Thank you.
Enjoy.

20:00.095 --> 20:04.862
Wow, everything's so fancy.
And everyone looks so perfect.

20:04.933 --> 20:06.525
Yeah, only because
they've had an army of people

20:06.602 --> 20:08.069
working on them all afternoon.

20:08.137 --> 20:10.697
And you look beautiful.

20:10.739 --> 20:13.207
Thank you. You look so...

20:13.242 --> 20:16.404
Hello, honey. Don't you look handsome.

20:16.444 --> 20:18.844
I love that tie on you.
Where'd you get it?

20:18.880 --> 20:22.043
- You bought it for me.
- Oh. Well, aren't I clever?

20:23.284 --> 20:25.411
- You've met Betty.
- Yes, of course.

20:25.453 --> 20:27.944
I'm so happy that you could make it.

20:27.989 --> 20:30.457
And I won't ask you to bring up
any of my bags tonight.

20:32.660 --> 20:36.596
Matthew, don't just stand off to the side.
Make sure you circulate.

20:36.631 --> 20:39.463
Edith, I love your new Labradoodle.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.831
Well, that didn't go so bad.

20:41.868 --> 20:44.336
Right, and remember
you still have torture to look forward to.

20:44.371 --> 20:45.429
Mmm-hmm.
- Stuffed mushroom?

20:46.740 --> 20:48.571
I'll be right back.

20:48.608 --> 20:49.939
Hello, there.

20:49.976 --> 20:51.637
Hi, Judge Wincroft.

20:51.678 --> 20:54.511
He has an S&M dungeon in
the basement of his weekend house.

20:54.548 --> 20:55.572
Hmm.

20:55.615 --> 20:57.310
This is great.

20:57.951 --> 20:59.248
Betty!

21:00.687 --> 21:03.178
I'd like you to meet Judge Wincroft.

21:03.223 --> 21:04.712
It's very nice to meet you.

21:04.757 --> 21:07.783
Matt, I don't know
where my mushroom cap went.

21:08.594 --> 21:11.119
Excuse me. Dinner is served.

21:11.197 --> 21:14.894
But first I would like to introduce
everyone to the newest piece

21:14.934 --> 21:16.959
in the Hartley art collection.

21:17.036 --> 21:20.802
Beginning in December,
it will be on display at the Louvre,

21:20.840 --> 21:24.435
but right now
it is here in my living room.

21:38.890 --> 21:43.554
What is an appetizer doing
on my painting?

21:46.431 --> 21:47.955
- Actually, Mrs...
- It was me, Mom.

21:48.032 --> 21:49.932
That's my mushroom cap.

21:49.968 --> 21:54.301
I was fooling around, tossing stuff
at Mr. Randolph. I apologize.

21:56.573 --> 21:57.801
Well, that's fine.

21:57.841 --> 22:00.674
If the artist were alive,
he'd get a good laugh,

22:00.711 --> 22:04.579
but he's dead,
which is why it's so valuable.

22:05.249 --> 22:07.547
Into the dining room, everyone.

22:12.923 --> 22:15.153
So unlike Matthew
to do something like that.

22:15.225 --> 22:17.750
I guess you bring out his playful side.

22:17.828 --> 22:18.885
Hmm?

22:22.899 --> 22:25.629
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay, don't worry.

22:30.840 --> 22:36.870
Marc, I thought I would be fine
selling everything, but I'm not.

22:36.913 --> 22:40.849
- So then don't.
- But I need the money.

22:40.883 --> 22:42.908
Why, God, why?

22:44.219 --> 22:46.585
What have I done to anger you?

22:46.621 --> 22:50.614
I just hate seeing you like this.

22:51.760 --> 22:54.092
Are you taking a picture of me
on your cell phone?

22:54.129 --> 22:55.391
No. No!

22:55.430 --> 22:56.419
Oh!

22:56.698 --> 23:00.134
This is killing me
as much as it's killing you.

23:00.168 --> 23:04.002
You think I like living
without your luxuries?

23:04.039 --> 23:06.906
That's just it, Marc.
They're not just luxuries.

23:06.942 --> 23:09.239
These things are who I am.

23:09.276 --> 23:14.179
Each fur tells a story,
each piece of jewelry is a piece of me.

23:14.214 --> 23:17.081
It reminds me
that I've achieved something.

23:17.117 --> 23:18.448
Because, damn it, I have.

23:18.485 --> 23:21.283
I came from nothing,
and I've accomplished something.

23:21.322 --> 23:24.120
- But your father was a senator.
- Shut up.

23:29.897 --> 23:33.492
It's the woman from the auction house.
What do you want me to tell her?

23:36.703 --> 23:38.967
Take it. Take all of this!

23:39.672 --> 23:42.368
Do with it what you want,
I don't care anymore!

23:42.408 --> 23:44.399
Just bring me the money!

23:45.144 --> 23:47.544
Marc, do you like what you see?

23:47.981 --> 23:50.449
- Uh-huh.
- Well, get used to it.

23:50.483 --> 23:53.714
Because starting now,
Mama is downsizing!

23:53.753 --> 23:55.812
Not where it counts, baby!

24:01.360 --> 24:04.227
All right, so I'm going to run
by the office,

24:04.262 --> 24:05.695
close the deal with this photographer,

24:05.731 --> 24:08.757
then I am gonna be back with
a couple of steaks, a bottle of wine,

24:08.800 --> 24:09.994
you and I are gonna celebrate.

24:10.035 --> 24:11.502
Have you read
about the treatment, Daniel?

24:11.536 --> 24:13.504
Some of these side effects are rough.

24:13.538 --> 24:15.768
I know. But I mean, Molly, it could work.

24:15.807 --> 24:19.265
10% chance? And considering
my history, more like 2%?

24:19.311 --> 24:22.508
Yeah, but it's still 2%.
I mean, come on, think about our future.

24:22.547 --> 24:25.208
There is no future, Daniel.

24:25.249 --> 24:28.275
This, what we have right now,
is our future.

24:28.319 --> 24:30.549
- Don't say that.
- I'm dying, Daniel.

24:30.621 --> 24:31.679
No!

24:34.592 --> 24:37.493
I realize that it's so hard for me
to understand

24:37.528 --> 24:39.155
what it is you're going through.

24:39.196 --> 24:41.323
Molly, I'm not going anywhere.

24:41.365 --> 24:44.766
I'm gonna be right by your side
through all of this.

24:44.802 --> 24:48.101
I promise. Please.

24:48.772 --> 24:51.172
I'm sorry, honey. I know
how I want to live the rest of my life,

24:51.207 --> 24:52.299
and it's not like this.

24:52.342 --> 24:54.674
- Molly, don't...
- I can't do it.

24:59.883 --> 25:02.443
So anyway,
this council meeting went on forever,

25:02.485 --> 25:05.613
and it was just so hot in there,
I actually fell asleep.

25:05.655 --> 25:08.089
- I mean, I even snored.
- You didn't?

25:08.124 --> 25:09.386
Well, it could've been embarrassing,

25:09.426 --> 25:11.621
but I managed to turn my snore
into a nay.

25:12.896 --> 25:14.624
That's hilarious!

25:14.663 --> 25:17.689
- Isn't that hilarious, Hilda?
Really.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.792
Oh, yeah, that is funny.

25:19.835 --> 25:22.497
Well, I know I'm gonna
hate myself in the morning,

25:22.538 --> 25:26.065
but I'm going to treat myself
to one more new potato.

25:26.708 --> 25:30.439
- This was an incredible meal, Ignacio.
- It was my pleasure, Your Honor.

25:30.479 --> 25:34.381
I just hope we can make a habit of this.
Right, Hilda?

25:34.416 --> 25:36.281
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

25:36.351 --> 25:38.114
You should just come
whenever you want.

25:41.022 --> 25:43.354
Everybody,
please be seated.

25:45.993 --> 25:47.688
- Are you sure there's nothing I can do?
- Don't worry...

25:47.728 --> 25:50.629
Matthew, I thought it'd be fun
if we split couples up.

25:50.665 --> 25:52.360
Come, I want you back there with me.

25:52.400 --> 25:53.697
Mom, I want to sit with Betty.

25:53.734 --> 25:56.202
No, stop. The name cards
were placed hours ago.

25:56.237 --> 25:57.704
It's all been settled.

25:57.738 --> 25:59.638
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

26:00.975 --> 26:04.000
Ignacio, come help me with dessert.

26:04.044 --> 26:05.841
Oh! Yeah, excuse us.

26:06.546 --> 26:08.639
Oh! Justin.

26:08.715 --> 26:10.706
- I'm trying to enjoy my new potato.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:10.784 --> 26:12.308
Hey, excuse me.

26:18.525 --> 26:20.516
So how awkward is this for you?

26:20.560 --> 26:24.155
What? No!
Why would this be awkward?

26:24.197 --> 26:27.166
Because they're working their butts off
trying to fix us up.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.791
Archie. I'm sorry.

26:28.834 --> 26:31.428
Honestly, I didn't know.
They just sprung this on me.

26:31.470 --> 26:33.995
Please, it happens all the time.

26:34.039 --> 26:36.473
I'm a reasonably attractive man
in his forties,

26:36.509 --> 26:38.067
with a mid-level government job.

26:38.110 --> 26:40.340
I'm a catch.

26:41.847 --> 26:46.750
And you... Your eyes have a story
that they wish to tell.

26:46.785 --> 26:51.222
And I have my whole life.
And I listen well.

26:53.559 --> 26:54.923
That's a Justin Timberlake song.

26:54.959 --> 26:59.259
I'm so glad you got that, because
that just would've been really weird.

27:08.039 --> 27:09.939
Thank you.

27:09.974 --> 27:13.000
I'm so pleased
you could all be here tonight.

27:13.044 --> 27:16.104
There's just so much to talk about,
so many interesting things happening.

27:17.382 --> 27:21.147
But you know me,
I like to stick to one topic.

27:21.685 --> 27:25.781
And it's something that
has been much on my mind,

27:25.822 --> 27:29.986
because it speaks to
how civilized people should live.

27:31.228 --> 27:35.130
What is going to be
the future of opera?

27:35.699 --> 27:36.893
Opera?

27:38.869 --> 27:40.928
You have a thought, Betty?

27:42.739 --> 27:46.230
I was just so excited to hear the topic.
I'm sorry. Please go on.

27:46.275 --> 27:48.470
Oh, no, really.
Why don't you start us off?

27:48.544 --> 27:52.412
Everybody, this is Betty Suarez,
she's a friend of Matthew's.

27:53.883 --> 27:57.785
Please, Betty.
I'd be fascinated to hear your opinion.

27:58.688 --> 28:02.124
The future of opera. Go.

28:06.829 --> 28:08.729
Well,

28:09.931 --> 28:14.231
my experience with opera
is not so vast,

28:15.303 --> 28:19.535
so I guess my opinion

28:20.342 --> 28:23.709
is not so, you know, fully,

28:24.913 --> 28:27.108
you know, formed,

28:28.216 --> 28:31.413
as some of you here.

28:47.167 --> 28:49.658
- Opera is fashion!
- Meaning?

28:50.337 --> 28:55.297
Meaning that the opera will thrive
as any art thrives,

28:56.343 --> 28:59.709
by evolving and embracing new ideas,

28:59.812 --> 29:01.677
and, of course, by giving its audience

29:01.714 --> 29:10.723
a grander, more hopeful
version of themselves.

29:10.723 --> 29:15.183
That is as succinct and insightful
a piece of criticism

29:15.228 --> 29:17.059
as I have ever heard.

29:17.096 --> 29:19.587
Do you mind if I use it
in my next column?

29:22.135 --> 29:26.400
Though what do you mean
when you say "fashion"?

29:26.438 --> 29:27.803
<i>Well, I work at Mode...</i>

29:27.839 --> 29:31.002
<i>I love Mode. It's like my Bible.</i>

29:31.076 --> 29:33.237
You know, and in some respects,

29:33.312 --> 29:36.145
what is more archaic
than couture dresses?

29:36.181 --> 29:37.978
- Like opera.
- Exactly.

29:38.016 --> 29:40.007
And eventually,
these couture collections

29:40.052 --> 29:42.919
have an enormous influence
on our modern style.

29:42.954 --> 29:47.653
And opera can do the same thing.
Absolutely right.

29:47.693 --> 29:50.923
<i>I saw Don Giovanni in Milan last year...</i>

29:57.702 --> 29:59.294
Here you go, Councilman.

29:59.337 --> 30:01.805
- Thank you for the take-out, Ignacio.
- My honor.

30:01.839 --> 30:04.399
Who knows,
my cooking may be eaten by royalty!

30:04.475 --> 30:07.808
Well, I was thinking of leaving a little
for my cleaning lady tomorrow.

30:07.845 --> 30:09.745
Just as good!

30:09.780 --> 30:13.238
Honey, could you come help me
in the kitchen with

30:14.784 --> 30:17.582
- you know...
- Oh, yeah! The you know.

30:17.620 --> 30:21.613
That thing. Good night. Excuse us.

30:21.658 --> 30:23.523
Thanks again.

30:23.560 --> 30:27.587
Yeah, subtlety doesn't run
in this family's genes.

30:27.630 --> 30:31.794
I guess, according to their plan, this is
when I'm supposed to ask you out.

30:31.835 --> 30:35.430
- Yeah, yeah, that's the plan.
- Well, good night.

30:35.505 --> 30:37.234
Whoa. Wait a minute!

30:37.307 --> 30:40.275
You're gonna disappoint them
like that? My dad cooked you dinner...

30:40.309 --> 30:43.142
Hilda, you're great.

30:43.178 --> 30:46.545
And nothing would make me happier
than to take you out on a real date.

30:46.582 --> 30:48.709
One that you know about.

30:49.351 --> 30:51.046
That sounds good.

30:52.821 --> 30:56.814
Okay, guys!
I asked her out and she said yes!

30:56.859 --> 30:57.917
- What?
- What?

30:57.960 --> 31:00.087
- What a surprise!
- Oh, my God. We had no idea.

31:00.195 --> 31:01.594
Oh! We're shocked!

31:01.630 --> 31:02.995
Please.

31:05.533 --> 31:09.025
Miles, what can I say?
We just couldn't live without you.

31:09.103 --> 31:12.368
Listen, I'm so sorry about the way
our last meeting ended.

31:12.440 --> 31:15.409
I just hate getting caught up in
all these messy business details.

31:15.443 --> 31:18.412
- And yet you do.
- I know. I'm so cute.

31:18.446 --> 31:21.847
So, I guess we'll check in next week,
start kicking around a concept?

31:21.883 --> 31:27.014
Whatever, I'm easy. Love to you both.
Air kiss, air kiss.

31:31.992 --> 31:34.085
So, I see you put your money together.

31:34.127 --> 31:38.655
Daniel, if we're going to be partners,
we need to be partners all the way.

31:38.698 --> 31:40.928
So I did what I had to do.

31:42.936 --> 31:46.838
You know, I know you think I'm always
looking for a way to muscle you out,

31:46.873 --> 31:48.807
but really I'm not.

31:48.842 --> 31:51.072
Life is too short.

31:51.111 --> 31:56.138
Well, how about that?
Daniel Meade is waxing philosophical.

31:58.551 --> 32:01.782
I'm just beginning to realize
what's most important.

32:01.821 --> 32:03.049
Because of Molly.

32:03.088 --> 32:08.048
She's just determined to live life
on her own terms. Even if it kills her.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.476
Mrs. Hartley, hi.

32:28.513 --> 32:31.812
I was just looking at your pictures.
They're great.

32:32.283 --> 32:35.719
- So, Betty, where did you go to college?
- Queens College.

32:35.753 --> 32:38.916
Lovely. And were you the first person
in your family to go?

32:38.957 --> 32:42.893
Yep. Yeah, I lived at home,
and I worked the whole time, but I did it.

32:42.927 --> 32:45.451
Good for you. That's wonderful.

32:45.496 --> 32:48.795
You're ambitious.
I can see you're going places.

32:48.866 --> 32:51.630
- Oh. Wow. Thank you.
- Yes.

32:51.702 --> 32:55.468
Matthew went to Yale,
he speaks three languages,

32:55.506 --> 32:57.770
he spent a year in Rome
on a Fulbright...

32:57.808 --> 33:01.869
- Have you heard him play the piano?
- Nope, not yet. But I can't wait to.

33:01.912 --> 33:03.379
Well, he plays beautifully.

33:03.413 --> 33:06.450
He took lessons for years
at the Turtle Bay Music School.

33:06.450 --> 33:09.680
- Do you know it?
- No. I haven't heard of it.

33:09.719 --> 33:12.381
It's a wonderful place.
All the kids study there.

33:12.421 --> 33:17.415
So, tell me, what exactly
do the two of you have in common?

33:20.062 --> 33:21.393
Um...

33:23.466 --> 33:25.058
Well, loads.

33:26.135 --> 33:28.262
Uh-huh. Loads.

33:28.337 --> 33:31.397
Betty, I have high hopes for my son.

33:31.474 --> 33:33.203
He's been given every privilege

33:33.242 --> 33:36.176
and I expect him
to take advantage of that.

33:38.513 --> 33:41.676
Okay. I'm not sure
I understand what you're saying.

33:41.716 --> 33:45.948
What I'm saying is that I hope
you enjoyed your meal tonight,

33:45.987 --> 33:49.184
but I don't think that
we'll be seeing you again.

34:05.973 --> 34:07.531
Where is it?

34:10.978 --> 34:13.139
You know, if you're cold,
you can just say something.

34:13.179 --> 34:15.614
We have, like, 17 fireplaces.

34:15.649 --> 34:18.583
Your mother just told me
that I'm not good enough for you

34:18.619 --> 34:20.712
and we don't have a future.

34:20.754 --> 34:22.415
- I'm leaving.
- No, Betty, please, please don't go...

34:22.456 --> 34:23.650
Matt, what if she's right?

34:23.690 --> 34:25.715
Matt, what if it matters
that I didn't go to Yale?

34:25.757 --> 34:27.748
- It doesn't matter.
- This is too much for me.

34:27.793 --> 34:29.955
I am not gonna come
between you and your mother.

34:30.029 --> 34:32.429
No, you won't.
I'd like to have you both in my life.

34:32.465 --> 34:34.159
What, and just keep us apart
all the time?

34:34.233 --> 34:36.167
Betty, please, listen.

34:36.202 --> 34:39.569
Look, I want this relationship
to have a future.

34:39.606 --> 34:43.268
You have to trust me. All right?
Don't worry about her.

34:43.309 --> 34:45.504
Matthew, dessert is ready.

34:45.545 --> 34:48.036
Come in after you say goodbye
to your friend.

34:48.081 --> 34:50.571
- I'm not saying goodbye to her, Mom.
- Oh?

34:50.616 --> 34:53.744
I'm saying goodbye to you.
Betty and I are leaving.

34:53.784 --> 34:55.411
Don't be ridiculous. Just come...

34:55.454 --> 34:58.651
No, I don't know exactly
what you said to her, but I can guess.

34:58.757 --> 35:01.282
- Matthew...
- Good night, Mother.

35:01.326 --> 35:03.658
I'm leaving with my girlfriend.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.554
Are you okay?

35:39.629 --> 35:42.427
Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

35:42.465 --> 35:44.433
No reason. Nothing.

35:44.501 --> 35:51.464
I just don't want our budget snacks
to set off another one of your episodes.

35:51.508 --> 35:55.171
I swear, Marc, if you took a picture
of me on your cell phone, I will kill you

35:55.211 --> 35:56.576
and eat you.

35:56.613 --> 36:00.913
But I've arrived at a better place,
and Daniel helped me get there.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.941
The boy blunder? How?

36:02.986 --> 36:06.614
Molly wants to live her life
till the day she dies.

36:06.655 --> 36:08.486
And, damn it, so do I.

36:14.897 --> 36:17.161
But what about the cash?
What about the equity?

36:17.199 --> 36:19.895
I can live without the furs
and the jewelry.

36:19.935 --> 36:22.096
But to hell if I'm going
to sacrifice everything.

36:22.137 --> 36:24.332
I've worked too hard
to let it all slip away.

36:24.373 --> 36:28.366
So, how are you going to pay for it?

36:28.410 --> 36:31.139
I will do whatever I have to do.

36:31.179 --> 36:33.113
Maybe I'll take out a second mortgage.

36:33.147 --> 36:36.275
All I know for sure is,
as God is my witness,

36:36.317 --> 36:41.414
I will never go without champagne
and caviar again.

36:42.757 --> 36:45.282
Now, pass me a blini, please.

36:46.527 --> 36:49.963
And I know it's horrible,
but I'm just so frustrated about it.

36:50.031 --> 36:52.499
Because she won't
do the treatment?

36:52.567 --> 36:57.060
I get what she's saying, I do.
It's just... I've done everything right,

36:58.271 --> 37:02.833
and for the first time in my adult life,
I am really in love.

37:02.876 --> 37:06.869
And I don't want to lose it.
And this treatment, it could work.

37:06.913 --> 37:09.177
- But, Daniel...
- No, I know, I know.

37:09.216 --> 37:12.481
I'm not the one with cancer.
Of course, it's her decision, but...

37:12.519 --> 37:15.716
Look, she's just trying to give you
the time she does have left.

37:15.789 --> 37:17.381
But I want more.

37:18.225 --> 37:20.488
Sometimes you can't get more.

37:21.494 --> 37:24.258
Sometimes you have to take
what you get.

37:31.003 --> 37:34.268
Oh! Hold the door! Thank you.
Hi, Mrs. Meade.

37:34.306 --> 37:36.035
Hello, Betty.

37:36.075 --> 37:39.602
So, did you wow Victoria Hartley
with your take on torture?

37:39.645 --> 37:43.103
No, not quite. She changed the topic.

37:43.182 --> 37:45.012
That old trick.

37:45.049 --> 37:48.917
And then she told me that
I was completely wrong for her son.

37:48.987 --> 37:52.115
Ooh. She's really playing
by the rich bitch handbook.

37:52.190 --> 37:55.091
I keep thinking there's got to be
something I can do to make her like me.

37:55.126 --> 37:58.926
Oh, please, Betty. You're never
going to win that woman over.

37:59.264 --> 38:03.223
Well, maybe that's true,
but I just don't understand why.

38:03.268 --> 38:06.635
Well, grow up, because not
everybody's going to like you.

38:06.671 --> 38:09.639
You've just got to suck it up
and embrace it.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.332
There's nothing I can do?

38:11.375 --> 38:12.740
Hell, yes,
there's something you can do!

38:12.776 --> 38:15.142
You can throw it right back at her.

38:15.179 --> 38:17.807
When one of those
silk-stocking hags stares me down,

38:17.848 --> 38:19.748
do you know what I do?

38:21.919 --> 38:22.943
Stare back?

38:24.421 --> 38:26.150
You got that right.

38:35.832 --> 38:36.958
Hey.

38:37.834 --> 38:38.960
Hey.

38:40.269 --> 38:42.032
Hey. It's cold out!

38:44.207 --> 38:45.799
What's going on?

38:45.842 --> 38:49.073
You want to live life? We're going
to live life. Put on your jacket.

38:49.111 --> 38:51.807
We're going hiking. And tomorrow,
we're gonna go to the beach.

38:51.848 --> 38:54.578
- But it's freezing!
- I don't care.

38:54.617 --> 38:57.984
Look, all I know is every free moment
of every free day I have

38:58.054 --> 38:59.645
is going to be spent with you.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.779
You wanna go traveling,
you wanna stay home,

39:01.823 --> 39:03.154
you wanna go to the movies,

39:03.191 --> 39:05.489
you wanna ride around
on the frigging subway all day...

39:05.527 --> 39:09.588
It doesn't matter.
All that matters is I love you, Molly.

39:09.631 --> 39:13.499
And I am going to treasure
every moment I have left with you.

39:14.836 --> 39:17.236
You got a problem with that?

39:17.272 --> 39:19.604
- No problem.
- Good.

39:22.677 --> 39:25.076
- Let's go play in the snow.
- Okay.

39:29.316 --> 39:31.511
Hey, where are you? I'm here.

39:32.086 --> 39:35.317
Well, hurry up. It's a beautiful day.
All right.

39:39.493 --> 39:41.120
Hi, Mrs. Hartley.

39:41.161 --> 39:44.289
- Waiting for my son?
- He's on his way down.

39:44.331 --> 39:48.233
Oh, that's right. Matthew's moving
back into his apartment today.

39:48.269 --> 39:52.034
I won't apologize for who I am
or what I think, Betty.

39:52.071 --> 39:53.902
Well, neither will I.

39:55.008 --> 39:56.475
What can I say?

39:56.509 --> 40:00.605
My judgments are severe.
It's just the way I look at the world.

40:01.748 --> 40:05.548
Well, I'm sorry for you.
But I might be around for a while.

40:13.993 --> 40:15.084
Hey!

40:15.794 --> 40:16.852
Hey.

40:16.895 --> 40:18.988
- Ready to go?
- All set. Wanna get a cab?

40:19.031 --> 40:21.397
No, let's walk. It's a nice day.

40:23.302 --> 40:26.430
So, you play the piano?
Oh, no...

40:26.471 --> 40:28.962
Oh, well,
now you have to show me.
