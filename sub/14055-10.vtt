Previously on The O.C.:

00:01.788 --> 00:02.828
Ryan,
have you seen...?

00:03.988 --> 00:05.188
-Lindsay.
-Hey.

00:06.188 --> 00:09.468
My ex is in town, but we never
really broke up.

00:09.628 --> 00:10.308
Did you meet the ex?

00:10.588 --> 00:12.868
-I know you did.
-All right, yes, I did.

00:13.068 --> 00:14.348
-And who is he?
-He's a she.

00:14.788 --> 00:16.148
-Jody went to sleep.
-Cool.

00:30.854 --> 00:33.214
-So what do I do?
-What do you want to do?

00:32.914 --> 00:36.794
What I want to do is drive over to her apartment
right now and ask her flat out

00:36.914 --> 00:40.914
-"Alex, are we in a relationship or are we not?"
-Good, man, you should do it.

00:41.114 --> 00:44.714
-He's not doing it.
-Ryan, it's been almost a week, okay,
and I still don't know where Alex stands.

00:45.074 --> 00:46.914
Is she back together
with her lesbian ex?

00:47.034 --> 00:51.234
And if so, are they opento some sort of menage
a three-way as in the film Summer Lovers?

00:51.354 --> 00:55.074
-Oh, I didn't even think of that.
-Yeah, well, I did, quite a bit, actually.

00:55.154 --> 00:57.194
If you have to wonder about it,
it's probably not happening.

00:57.394 --> 00:59.554
Which part, the threesome
or the relationship?

01:01.394 --> 01:04.873
-So you never had, like, a moment's doubt about you and Lindsay?
-Not really.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.194
-Pollen or something.
-All right, there may have been a moment.

01:09.514 --> 01:10.834
Or two.

01:11.674 --> 01:12.634
So what'd you do?

01:13.154 --> 01:15.274
He showed up on Lindsay's
doorstep and he said,

01:15.474 --> 01:18.194
"He's not going anywhere
until she gave him a shot."

01:18.314 --> 01:19.474
That's what you should do,
dude.

01:19.634 --> 01:24.314
You should go to Alex, but instead of asking
her what she wants, you tell her what you want.

01:25.034 --> 01:26.514
Is that how it works
with you and Summer?

01:29.514 --> 01:33.994
Or you should just focus on the good
stuff in your life, like school.

01:35.794 --> 01:36.714
Or comics.

01:38.434 --> 01:39.674
Yeah,
I got nothing.

01:39.914 --> 01:41.034
But at least I got my friends.

01:42.074 --> 01:43.834
Well,
if it isn't the three amigos.

01:44.514 --> 01:45.354
-Hola.
-Hi.

01:45.994 --> 01:46.834
I'm so hungry.

01:50.874 --> 01:51.954
You didn't order yet,
did you?

01:53.954 --> 01:54.394
Thanks.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.394
Hey, come on,
we can squeeze you in.

01:58.434 --> 01:59.234
No, it's okay.

01:59.914 --> 02:00.874
I'll see you guys later.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.554
-Where are you going?
-To get what I want.

02:05.594 --> 02:08.274
The strawberry
shortcake is to die for.

"Husband seeking to satisfy wife's
curiosity. Enjoys toy..." Ooh, careful.

02:47.474 --> 02:48.794
Oh, here's one,
honey.

02:48.954 --> 02:50.714
It's a guesthouse,
close to the beach.

02:51.074 --> 02:55.674
-It's got parking, fridge and hookups.
-Why are you looking for a guesthouse when you need an office?

02:55.794 --> 02:58.794
You can turn a guesthouse into a great
office, plus this one has hookups.

02:58.874 --> 03:02.954
This high-rise office complex has
panoramic ocean and country club views.

03:03.114 --> 03:06.594
-Sounds like Partridge, Savage and Kahn. Where is it?
-Right next to Partridge, Savage and Kahn.

03:06.914 --> 03:10.194
-At least your old clients will know where to find you.
-I'm not takingany of my corporate clients with me.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.554
Now that I'm on my own, I'm going
back into the public interest stuff.

03:12.674 --> 03:17.954
-That stuff made me want to be a lawyer in the first place.
-You can still be a public interest lawyer in a private sector offi

03:18.634 --> 03:21.714
-This guesthouse is $850 a month. How much is yours?
-I can get you a deal through my office.

03:21.834 --> 03:26.594
-No, thank you. I got to go meet my Realtor.
-Maybe I should go with you.

03:26.794 --> 03:30.474
No, no. I'll be fine. It's the same lady
who got Jimmy his bachelor pad.

03:31.114 --> 03:33.754
Right.
I'm going with you.

03:55.777 --> 03:56.257
Marissa.

03:58.857 --> 03:59.977
What are you doing in here?

04:00.097 --> 04:01.377
I'm sorry.
I heard the music.

04:01.977 --> 04:03.577
-You're not at school.
-Yeah, you're not at work.

04:04.857 --> 04:08.817
No, I'm running late. I'm down to my
last clean shirt and we're out of coffee.

04:08.937 --> 04:12.377
-When your mother leaves town, my life goes to pieces.
-Yeah, well, you shouldhave gone with her.

04:12.537 --> 04:17.377
-You seem like you could use the vacation.
-She's not on vacation. She's doing research for a magazine.

04:17.457 --> 04:20.096
She's in Europe doing research
for a magazine about Orange County?

04:20.216 --> 04:21.297
Do you need a ride to school?

04:21.536 --> 04:23.777
Oh,
I'm not going.

04:24.417 --> 04:27.257
-I'm not feeling so well.
-Sorry to hear that.

04:28.017 --> 04:31.657
I'll tell you what. I'll call my physician.
Have him drop in on you after lunch.

04:31.777 --> 04:37.217
Oh, that's okay, you know? I figured I should probably
just stay home and rest in case, you know it's...

04:37.897 --> 04:41.897
-West Nile or something.
-All right. I'll be in my office all day if you need me.

04:42.097 --> 04:46.817
-I'll call in and check up on you.
-I may not pick up, you know? I'll just be sleeping.

04:57.537 --> 04:58.057
Hello.

04:58.417 --> 04:59.497
So what are we doing today?

04:59.657 --> 05:03.017
-I'm sleeping.
-No, you're not.

05:03.417 --> 05:07.497
-We're going to breakfast and then we're going shopping.
-Don't you have school?

05:07.697 --> 05:11.257
Yeah, but my mom's in Europe and my
stepdad's completely clueless.

05:11.617 --> 05:14.577
Aren't you sick of me yet? We've hung
out every single day this week.

05:14.937 --> 05:19.577
-No, why? Are you sick of me?
-No, no, of course not. It's just...

05:21.537 --> 05:25.377
-Jody's still here.
-I thought she was goingback to LA.

05:25.457 --> 05:26.817
Yeah, yeah,
she was, she was.

05:26.977 --> 05:30.337
But, we got into this
huge fight and then...

05:31.417 --> 05:33.657
And then you spent the rest
of the night making up?

05:34.537 --> 05:38.177
-Who's knocking on my door at 9:00 in the morning?
-Yeah, right, saved by the bell.

05:38.257 --> 05:40.697
Are you calling me
from outside my door?

05:41.017 --> 05:44.377
Because that would be creepy.

05:45.097 --> 05:46.457
Ah, good to see you,
too, Alex.

05:46.777 --> 05:48.137
-Seth.
-Seth?

05:48.257 --> 05:48.977
Can I call you back?

05:50.017 --> 05:51.337
Doesn't anyone go
to school anymore?

05:51.457 --> 05:52.937
Listen,
I'm sorry to wake you.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.257
-Do I hear water running?
-Yes.

05:57.777 --> 05:58.857
Jody's taking a shower.

05:59.537 --> 06:01.217
Jody.
Jody's still here.

06:02.017 --> 06:04.417
Oh, that's great.
That's fantastic.

06:04.577 --> 06:06.417
At least you're not taking
a shower together.

06:07.137 --> 06:09.457
-Look...
-Listen, I just need to know where I stand, okay?

06:09.617 --> 06:12.777
Seth, I told you,
I don't do relationships.

06:12.857 --> 06:14.577
Yeah, well, you did Jody,
so to speak.

06:14.697 --> 06:16.297
Yes, and look how well
that turned out.

06:16.857 --> 06:18.617
What is that
supposed to mean?

06:18.937 --> 06:19.577
Jody.

06:20.257 --> 06:20.817
Seth.

06:22.417 --> 06:25.777
Sorry.  I would have introduced
you guys, but I didn't want you to meet.

06:26.297 --> 06:27.137
I'm going back to bed.

06:27.537 --> 06:28.057
I'm sorry.

06:28.617 --> 06:29.297
I'm sorry.

06:33.657 --> 06:34.857
You maybe want
to grab breakfast?

06:34.937 --> 06:37.177
We could go down to the...
There's a nice place...

06:45.497 --> 06:48.377
So,  are Kirsten and Sandy going to care
that Seth skipped first period?

06:48.577 --> 06:51.017
Not going to be excited about it,
but they're pretty easygoing.

06:51.137 --> 06:52.497
Really?
Kirsten is?

06:52.657 --> 06:54.257
Sandy is.
Kirsten's more...

06:54.457 --> 06:55.297
Like her dad?

06:55.617 --> 06:56.897
In some ways,
I guess.

06:57.057 --> 06:58.657
Am I?

06:59.897 --> 07:01.417
I mean, he's my dad,
too, so...

07:02.217 --> 07:03.577
Is this a trick question?

07:03.697 --> 07:07.177
No, it's just I don't
know him and you do, so...

07:08.017 --> 07:09.337
Why,
is he a monster?

07:10.057 --> 07:12.577
Oh, well, he's not the
greatest person in the world.

07:13.017 --> 07:13.857
To me, anyway.

07:14.337 --> 07:17.177
He, um, thinks I'm
after the Cohens' money.

07:18.217 --> 07:19.497
Yeah, I know.

07:19.817 --> 07:21.497
But other than that,
he's great.

07:22.857 --> 07:24.777
-You should call him.
-And say what?

07:24.897 --> 07:27.257
"Hi, Dad, it's your illegitimate
daughter. Want to have lunch?"

07:27.657 --> 07:29.257
I could always have
Kirsten talk to him for you.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.697
Yeah, she has
a couple times.

07:32.777 --> 07:34.697
So you'll call,
right?

07:34.817 --> 07:38.257
-I mean, he's got to sooner or later.
-Yeah, right. Sooner or later.

07:47.017 --> 07:50.977
At the moment, this is the only beach-adjacent
property we have in your price range, Mr. Cohen.

07:53.217 --> 07:55.337
As you can see, it's a
bit of a fixer-upper.

07:55.497 --> 07:57.737
-That's one way to put it.
-Who are you kidding, Gail?

07:57.817 --> 07:59.377
This place is a
first-class dump.

08:01.137 --> 08:02.217
And I like it.

08:03.097 --> 08:04.177
Sandy, no,
you don't.

08:04.417 --> 08:08.617
You just like the idea of having an office
near the beach so you can surf between clients.

08:08.897 --> 08:12.417
-I hadn't even thought of that.
-Sandy, this is a surf shack, not a law office.

08:12.537 --> 08:14.537
That's exactly why I like it.
Hello.

08:16.377 --> 08:17.297
Max?

08:17.897 --> 08:20.217
Unbelievable. How are you?
It's my professor from law school.

08:20.297 --> 08:22.737
No, no, now's a great time.
I'm just moving into my new office.

08:23.617 --> 08:24.377
I'll be right back.

08:25.697 --> 08:28.017
-Sandy, you're moving in?
-I'll take it.

08:28.537 --> 08:29.817
So what are you doing in town?

08:31.137 --> 08:31.737
Really?

08:32.616 --> 08:33.577
Everything okay?

08:36.537 --> 08:37.417
I understand.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.577
We can talk about it
when you get here.

08:51.817 --> 08:52.657
What's up with Cohen?

08:53.657 --> 08:56.137
-I guess it didn't go well with Alex.
-She broke up with him?

08:56.337 --> 08:57.657
I don't know.
Maybe.

08:58.137 --> 09:00.417
Well, why don't you go find out?
And then report back to me.

09:06.337 --> 09:07.817
So,
how'd it go?

09:07.977 --> 09:12.337
Well, the good news is she told
Jody to get the hell out, too, so...

09:14.017 --> 09:16.977
-I'm sorry, man.
-Thanks. It's all right.

09:17.137 --> 09:18.737
At least now you can
get back to your life, right?

09:18.857 --> 09:20.657
I don't have a life,
remember?

09:20.737 --> 09:22.897
Then you should get one.
Do something for you.

09:23.137 --> 09:24.297
-Go sailing.
-All right.

09:24.817 --> 09:26.897
-Continue to doodle.
-Okay.

09:28.857 --> 09:32.617
Cohen, this is what
you should be doing.

09:32.737 --> 09:36.417
What, drawing the women who've wronged
me as whip-wielding warrior princesses?

09:36.537 --> 09:38.417
-Yeah, in your own comic.
-Yeah, okay.

09:38.617 --> 09:40.457
-Dude, you're awesome.
-I appreciate it.

09:40.617 --> 09:45.217
Cohen, I got you a double latte
because you looked sad.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.657
-Cohen's going to do his own comic.
-He is?

09:47.737 --> 09:51.097
-Well, I don't know.
-What are you talking about, man?

09:51.217 --> 09:53.417
-Do you not want to do it?
-No, I do, sort of.

09:53.617 --> 09:56.297
Then let's bounce some ideas around, man.
Study hall right now. Let's go.

09:56.697 --> 09:57.097
Wha...?

09:57.577 --> 10:00.337
-All right. Okay. Thanks for the coffee, Summer.
-Yeah, thank you very much.

10:01.337 --> 10:02.097
You're welcome?

10:03.657 --> 10:05.497
So,
you and Seth are...?

10:06.497 --> 10:07.337
Friends...

10:07.857 --> 10:08.537
I hope...

10:09.337 --> 10:10.137
someday.

10:10.537 --> 10:14.057
-And you and Jody are...?
-Over, finished, for good.

10:15.137 --> 10:15.977
Hmm. Really?

10:16.257 --> 10:17.617
How does she feel about that?

10:18.017 --> 10:23.137
she hates me now, but, I mean, we
mean to much to each other to let...

10:25.817 --> 10:28.377
That bitch!
She stole my necklace.

10:28.977 --> 10:29.617
Which one?

10:30.137 --> 10:35.977
We bought each other these matching heart-shaped necklaces,
like, a year ago, and mine's gone. I can't believe her.

10:36.337 --> 10:37.697
Well,
how do you know she took it?

10:37.817 --> 10:42.137
Because she was using the fact that I still wear mine
as a sign I'm not over her, which I am.

10:42.217 --> 10:44.657
I just...
I loved it.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.457
Well,
so let's go get it.

10:48.377 --> 10:49.777
You want to go to L.
A. now?

10:51.177 --> 10:52.137
I can't.
I have work.

10:52.217 --> 10:54.297
-So we'll go tomorrow.
-How? You have school.

10:54.377 --> 10:59.297
I have a mom who's spa-hopping and a stepdad
who doesn't care about anyone but himself.

11:00.977 --> 11:03.417
Come on. You can't let
her steal your heart.

11:22.977 --> 11:23.897
Kirsten's not here.

11:24.257 --> 11:25.577
I'm actually here
to see you...

11:26.337 --> 11:27.697
-if you have a second.
-I don't.

11:28.417 --> 11:29.577
It's about Lindsay.

11:32.617 --> 11:33.577
Shut  the door.

11:38.177 --> 11:38.857
What about her?

11:39.297 --> 11:40.897
She's been asking
questions about you..

11:41.137 --> 11:42.337
who you are,
what you're like

11:42.497 --> 11:44.777
and even though I told her, she
still wants to get to know you.

11:45.057 --> 11:47.417
She sent you here
to tell me this?

11:47.657 --> 11:50.297
She  has no idea I'm here.
I just thought maybe I should...

11:50.377 --> 11:53.217
Continue to position yourself
between me and members of my family.

11:53.337 --> 11:56.937
Ryan, if I wanted a relationship
with Lindsay,I would have one.

11:57.057 --> 11:57.937
Funny,
that's what she said.

11:58.057 --> 11:58.657
Smart girl.

11:58.777 --> 12:00.217
You have no idea.

12:00.977 --> 12:02.257
You should,
though.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.297
How's your relationship
with your father, Ryan?

12:06.737 --> 12:07.817
He still in jail?

12:09.377 --> 12:11.337
And you would be, too,
if it weren't for Sandy.

12:12.337 --> 12:13.937
So I guess Lindsay and I
are both better off.

12:14.097 --> 12:15.177
Thank you so much for your time.

12:34.457 --> 12:37.457
I was under the impression
that you'd become a successful lawyer.

12:39.017 --> 12:39.937
Oh, my God.

12:41.737 --> 12:42.897
How are you,
Max?

12:44.617 --> 12:48.097
It's hard to believe its been over 20 years
since you were my favorite student.

12:48.217 --> 12:52.377
It is so good to see you.
Well, come on in to my, my new office.

12:53.817 --> 12:56.537
So, uh... what have
you been up to?

12:57.297 --> 13:00.737
Well, I, uh... Let's see, I...
I left Berkeley.

13:01.217 --> 13:02.337
And moved to Princeton.

13:02.897 --> 13:05.697
-I am retired now.
-Congratulations.

13:07.217 --> 13:11.137
-So what brings you here?
-Sandy, I need your help.

13:13.097 --> 13:14.897
I have to find Rebecca.

13:19.017 --> 13:21.297
Why now?
After all this time?

13:26.017 --> 13:27.657
Because,
Sandy, I've...

13:28.017 --> 13:36.177
I've got a couple of strokes, and the doctors told me that I,
should get my affairs in order, as soon as possible.

13:37.097 --> 13:41.417
I-I just want to be able to see
my daughter once again before...

13:41.657 --> 13:42.537
I understand.

13:44.417 --> 13:47.297
Well, you know, I haven't heard a thing
since she ran away to Canada...

13:48.257 --> 13:50.817
22 years ago.
You haven't heard from her?

13:50.897 --> 13:58.857
No, no, no. She and I weren't exactly on speaking terms
even... even before the... accident.

13:59.177 --> 14:02.577
I-I just thought that if she'd get
in touch with anybody, Sandy, it'd be you.

14:03.737 --> 14:05.217
You were the love of her life.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.537
That was a long time ago.

14:10.497 --> 14:12.377
-We were kids.
-No, she loved you, Sandy.

14:14.657 --> 14:16.497
Now,
will you help me find her?

14:19.337 --> 14:20.697
I'll see what I can do.

14:23.257 --> 14:24.657
Thank you,
Sandy.

14:25.777 --> 14:29.337
You know, I hate to stir up things
when you have a wife and a family and...

14:29.457 --> 14:33.417
-No, my-my wife will understand.
-Will she?

14:39.368 --> 14:41.608
You're going to prison?
Just for the day.

14:41.688 --> 14:44.048
I have to drive to Santa Barbara,
to Lompoc, to see a prisoner there.

14:44.248 --> 14:46.848
-Who?
-This political activist I knew back in my Berkeley days

14:46.928 --> 14:47.768
Joe Zukowsky

14:48.488 --> 14:49.728
but I'll be back before dinner.

14:50.008 --> 14:53.408
-What do you have to talk to him about?
-Well, you know, a missing person.

14:53.488 --> 14:54.728
Doing a favor for a friend.

14:54.888 --> 14:56.128
Your old law school professor.

14:57.608 --> 14:58.528
Who's missing?

15:00.568 --> 15:01.408
Rebecca.

15:01.888 --> 15:04.008
As in Rebecca Blume,
love of your life?

15:04.088 --> 15:05.768
She is not the love of my life.

15:05.808 --> 15:07.368
Sandy, you were engaged
to be married.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.288
We were engaged to be engaged.

15:09.368 --> 15:13.488
-Until she burned down a nuclear lab site.
-We do not know that she did that, for sure.

15:13.568 --> 15:16.048
-Sandy, she fled the country.
-Well, I know,

15:17.248 --> 15:19.648
but her dad is dying and he
asked me to find her for him.

15:20.328 --> 15:21.648
He was my mentor
in law school.

15:21.728 --> 15:23.728
I wouldn't be a lawyer
if it weren't for him.

15:24.448 --> 15:26.688
-I can't say no.
-Well, what are you going to do when you find her?

15:26.808 --> 15:32.688
If  I find her, I'm gonna try and convince her to turn
herself in and you know, let the case go to trial.

15:40.688 --> 15:42.888
Well, seems someone's
feeling better today.

15:43.168 --> 15:44.928
-Not really.
-Oh, sorry to hear that.

15:47.728 --> 15:50.408
You know, I called several times
to check up on you yesterday.

15:50.768 --> 15:52.088
Huh. I must
have been asleep.

15:52.208 --> 15:54.728
And then I came home last night
and you weren't here. I was worried.

15:55.808 --> 15:56.448
Gotta go.

15:56.728 --> 15:57.408
-Where?
-Out.

15:57.768 --> 16:00.168
-To the doctor.
-Marissa, come back here.

16:00.328 --> 16:03.528
Or what?
You're not my father, Cal.

16:03.688 --> 16:07.608
You know what? If you want to parent someone, why don't
you go over to Lindsay's house and ruin her life?

16:08.288 --> 16:10.008
Oh, that's right,
you already have.

16:11.008 --> 16:11.688
Don't wait up.

16:15.888 --> 16:18.168
-So what's it about?
-Oh, uh, well...

16:18.968 --> 16:21.808
-heroes nd, you know... villains.
-Good and evil.

16:21.928 --> 16:23.848
Sure. Darkness, and then
you have light.

16:24.368 --> 16:25.688
You guys have
no idea, do you?

16:25.768 --> 16:27.648
No, not so much really,
but you have to admit--

16:27.728 --> 16:33.208
-its pretty exciting. Our very own comic book?
-Hey, it could be autobiographical.

16:33.648 --> 16:34.528
Yeah, it could.

16:34.888 --> 16:39.968
Yeah, the life of like a young, Jewish boy
growing up in Orange County. I like it very much already.

16:40.088 --> 16:44.848
-A young Jewish boy with powers.
-Sure. No. Yeah. A kid with a secret. In a town full of secrets.

16:45.048 --> 16:47.968
-Fistfights, fashion shows.
-Definitely. Basically, life in Orange County.

16:48.088 --> 16:50.368
But with powers.
I like it a lot, and...

16:52.208 --> 16:53.448
What have you done
to my boyfriend?

16:53.848 --> 16:55.888
Okay. Look, it was his idea
in the first place.

16:56.008 --> 16:57.888
-And we just had a major breakthrough.
-Yeah, we did.

16:57.968 --> 17:04.248
-Oh, sweetie, do you realize how lame you just sounded?
-Summer, if you're not nice, somebody's not gonna be in the comic.

17:04.328 --> 17:06.647
Ooh. Yeah.
Shakin' in my boots, Cohen.

17:09.728 --> 17:11.248
Sweetie.
Hi.

17:11.367 --> 17:12.728
I will see you out front
after school.

17:13.688 --> 17:22.528
Actually, we're working, after school, but I would love
to, uh, you know, hang out with you a little bit later.

17:22.568 --> 17:24.328
Perhaps dinner
and a movie?

17:26.488 --> 17:27.328
Well, I guess.

17:27.608 --> 17:30.768
-Just not a comic book movie.
-Comic book movies sucks anyway.

17:30.968 --> 17:33.248
-True.
-Dude, you didn't like X2?

17:33.368 --> 17:34.328
-Really?
-I've seen better.

17:34.488 --> 17:35.288
What have you done to him?

17:35.408 --> 17:39.768
I swear to God, Cohen, by the time the sun goes down,
if Brainstorming Boy here doesn't turn back into my boyfriend...

17:39.928 --> 17:43.888
Brainstorming Boy. Brainstorm.
.. Brainstorming Lad. Right.

17:43.928 --> 17:49.248
Let's work with this. Brainstorming Kid. Brainstorming
Young Ward with the secret identity which is,

17:49.368 --> 17:53.488
at night he's Brainstorming Man,
and what that is, is he's a genius.

17:53.768 --> 17:56.128
The contracts have been vetted twice,
so I just need you to sign.

17:59.408 --> 18:02.488
-Dad, are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry.

18:05.968 --> 18:08.288
-You take good care of me, Kiki.
-Better than I deserve.

18:08.368 --> 18:11.128
-What does that mean?
-It means I haven't always been the best father.

18:11.208 --> 18:12.688
Pretty much.
.. no.

18:14.888 --> 18:17.848
-You still in touch with Lindsay?
-Are you?

18:17.968 --> 18:26.528
-She doesn't ever bothercalling me.
-Dad, she's in high school. If you want to hear from Lindsay, you've to call her.

18:30.128 --> 18:32.848
Uh, you were right.
Caleb Nichol is not a good guy.

18:33.328 --> 18:34.128
Why, why happened?
Did he call you?

18:34.288 --> 18:37.888
No, but I a9.com'd him
last night, and according to

18:38.048 --> 18:43.288
The O.C. Weekly, he's pretty much everything that's wrong
with Western Civilization, all wrapped up in one guy.

18:44.048 --> 18:46.248
So,
even if he did call me...

18:48.688 --> 18:53.448
-He's calling me. It says Newport Group. Why is he calling me?
-No, it's not. It's probably Kirsten.

18:55.088 --> 18:57.128
Right. Um.
.. sorry.

18:58.248 --> 19:01.048
-Hey, Kirsten.
-Lindsay, Caleb Nichol.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.488
I was thinking it's time
you and I sat down.

19:12.488 --> 19:13.448
What was that about?

19:14.928 --> 19:15.928
Um,
it was Caleb.

19:16.728 --> 19:18.888
-He wants to have dinner tonight.
-You're kidding?

19:20.488 --> 19:22.808
-Will you come with me?
-I don't think that's a good idea.

19:22.928 --> 19:23.688
Please.

19:24.488 --> 19:25.808
I'm not gonna go
without you.

19:27.688 --> 19:30.608
-He's not gonna be happy about this.
-Do you really care about Caleb Nichol's happiness?

19:30.728 --> 19:33.648
-I care about yours.
-Well, then,I will see you tonight.

19:46.288 --> 19:47.648
So, what does
the butterfly mean?

19:48.928 --> 19:52.368
Oh. It means,
I was drunk.

19:52.528 --> 19:55.648
-No way.
-Yeah. I was drunk.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.288
I had just gotten
emancipated from my parents,

19:57.568 --> 20:01.248
and the words "Mom" and "Dad" with a huge
X through them was way too expensive.

20:01.328 --> 20:04.728
You got emancipated? I thought
only child stars did that.

20:04.808 --> 20:06.768
Yup. Me, Hilary Duff,
and Lil Bow Wow.

20:09.048 --> 20:10.168
Wait.
So how did you do it?

20:10.728 --> 20:13.448
I  petitioned the court.
I had my parents sign the form,

20:13.528 --> 20:16.488
which they were more than happy to do when
they found out about me and Jody,

20:17.648 --> 20:19.048
and, um,
that was it.

20:19.128 --> 20:20.008
I was free.

20:20.688 --> 20:24.088
-I wish I could do that.
-Piss your parents off bad enough.

20:24.208 --> 20:25.608
Believe me,
I've tried.

20:25.968 --> 20:28.408
Well, then I guess
they really love you.

20:33.168 --> 20:36.128
-Do you ever miss yours?
-Sometimes.

20:36.568 --> 20:41.288
-But my friends are my family, you know?
-I do.

20:57.088 --> 20:58.688
Sandy Cohen.

20:59.408 --> 21:01.688
I couldn't believe it
when they told me.

21:05.568 --> 21:08.168
-How are you, Joe?
-Well, not as good as you.

21:08.648 --> 21:11.768
You look good, successful.
What happened?

21:12.408 --> 21:16.248
-You sell out?
-No. I did 15 years in the Public Defenders' office.

21:17.608 --> 21:21.328
Good for you.
Maybe you can work me up
an appeal, get me out of here.

21:21.568 --> 21:26.048
-How? You confessed.
-To an act of civil disobedience.

21:26.288 --> 21:30.328
-Not manslaughter.
-You set the place on fire. And a man died.

21:30.408 --> 21:33.648
It was an accident. Custodian wasn't supposed
to be there. You know that.

21:37.448 --> 21:41.688
Like any of that matters now.
What do you want, Sandy?

21:43.328 --> 21:44.528
I'm looking for Rebecca.

21:47.168 --> 21:50.048
Sandy Cohen is coming to me,
looking for Rebecca.

21:50.168 --> 21:57.768
-Oh, let it go. This isn't about you and me.
-When it comes to Rebecca, it's always been about you and me.

21:57.808 --> 21:58.648
Well,
not anymore.

22:00.928 --> 22:04.488
Okay.
Then what's this about?

22:04.768 --> 22:05.608
Her father.

22:07.288 --> 22:09.048
He's sick.
He's looking for her.

22:11.408 --> 22:16.328
I tell you what.
He can look as far and wide as he wants to.

22:16.968 --> 22:18.048
He's never gonna find her.

22:19.368 --> 22:22.088
-So, you're not gonna help me?
-Oh, I can't help you, Sandy.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.248
Rebecca...

22:25.848 --> 22:27.448
she's dead.

22:36.601 --> 22:37.761
She's dead?

22:41.001 --> 22:42.081
I'm so sorry.

22:43.441 --> 22:44.361
I can't believe this.

22:46.321 --> 22:50.561
-I can't believe it, either.
-Are you calling the professor?

22:50.761 --> 22:54.481
An old friend of mine, one of the guys in the group.
He's a lawyer now in Vancouver.

22:54.641 --> 22:57.081
Hello. Yes, directory assistance
for Vancouver, please.

22:57.441 --> 23:00.361
-But why? What are you gonna find out?
-Yes, please, I'd like the number for Mark Denham

23:00.561 --> 23:03.241
D-E-N-H-A-M.
Thank you.

23:03.801 --> 23:10.161
Well, if she was sick, there'd be insurance forms or hospital records
or something. And, God forbid, if she were dead,

23:10.241 --> 23:11.521
there'd be a death certificate.

23:14.721 --> 23:16.001
So you don't think she's dead.

23:17.441 --> 23:20.401
I can't believe that if she were dying,
she wouldn't try to contact her dad.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.561
Or you.

23:33.041 --> 23:35.561
We're just gonna get what we came for
and then get the hell out of here, all right?

23:35.721 --> 23:39.081
-Are you all right? 'Cause you seem nervous.
-No, I'm not. I just...

23:39.521 --> 23:42.321
Don't let her intimidate you, okay?
And let me do all the talking.

23:43.561 --> 23:46.961
don't mention anything
about the necklace.

23:48.241 --> 23:51.361
-I thought you were over her.
-I am. I am. I just...

23:51.561 --> 23:54.081
-Don't let her talk me into staying the night.
-You can't.

23:54.241 --> 23:57.281
-You have to take me home.
-Right. Good one. Remember that.

24:05.881 --> 24:07.441
I had a feeling it might...

24:09.561 --> 24:10.641
What is she doing here?

24:14.561 --> 24:15.881
We came to get
Alex's stuff.

24:19.121 --> 24:20.241
And we're not staying.

24:21.641 --> 24:23.081
If you say so.

24:32.121 --> 24:33.761
-Hey.
-Hey...

24:34.481 --> 24:37.121
Brian Gatwood,
A.K.A. Kid Chino.

24:37.441 --> 24:43.921
The strong but silent youth from the wrong side of the tracks
who, when provoked, unleashes his fists of fury.

24:44.161 --> 24:47.481
Maybe we should change your
superhero name to Overdressed Lad.

24:47.641 --> 24:50.241
Lindsay asked me to be the buffer
tonight between her and Caleb.

24:50.321 --> 24:54.441
-I thought we were working tonight. And Grandpa hates you.
-I told her that. She thought I was overreacting.

24:54.481 --> 24:58.761
Well, hey, man, at least you show up on his radar.
He once asked my mom if I was mildly retarded.

24:58.921 --> 25:01.321
-Well, wait till he finds out about your powers.
-What powers?

25:01.921 --> 25:04.361
Turns out I don't make
a very convincing superhero.

25:06.241 --> 25:09.081
-You do have powers.
-Hey, can I see this?

25:14.121 --> 25:18.241
-What are these?
-They're just sketches I did in Portland.

25:18.921 --> 25:21.561
-The summer without Summer.
-Has Zach seen these?

25:21.601 --> 25:24.161
-No, I was gonna show him tonight.
-No, you are not. You are not gonna show these to Zach.

25:24.201 --> 25:26.761
-Dude, they're just drawings.
-Of a girl you were clearly obsessed with.

25:27.121 --> 25:29.441
'Kay, first of all, "obsessed,"
pretty strong word.

25:31.241 --> 25:33.201
Maybe you're right,
and therefore I won't show him.

25:33.881 --> 25:35.641
-They're really good, though.
-Thanks.

25:36.241 --> 25:40.841
Hey, don't let Grandpa scare you, all right?
Remember, you're Brian Gatwood, Fists of Fury.

25:54.881 --> 25:57.241
-Sure you don't want a beer?
-We have to drive back.

25:57.841 --> 25:58.521
Tonight.

25:59.121 --> 26:03.121
Okay, so far I have found two T-shirts,
a bra and my fat jeans.

26:04.081 --> 26:06.601
-What else do you have of mine?
-Nothing, I swear.

26:06.801 --> 26:10.161
-So then you wouldn't mind if I kept looking.
-Oh, you can look all night if you want.

26:12.001 --> 26:12.721
I won't be long.

26:17.721 --> 26:21.641
-Breakups, huh?
-Get ready, you're next.

26:22.521 --> 26:25.841
-I'm not her...
-I'm sure you're not.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.201
-My motorcycle boots!
-Those are mine.

26:28.361 --> 26:31.041
-How can you say these are yours?
-Because I bought them.

26:31.161 --> 26:33.241
Okay, see?
That is your problem.

26:33.401 --> 26:34.681
Okay,
here we go.

26:36.201 --> 26:37.441
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

26:38.441 --> 26:40.601
Tell me what my problem is.
I can't wait to hear this.

26:40.881 --> 26:44.761
I don't even know where to begin. You know what?
Keep my boots, keep my records,it's fine.

26:44.921 --> 26:45.681
It's not fine.

26:56.441 --> 26:57.441
What do you want from me?

27:00.081 --> 27:01.401
I want you to stay.

27:08.481 --> 27:10.841
I want to talk about
what's going on here.

27:14.881 --> 27:17.641
Why don't you take Alex's Jeep home.
I'll bring her back later.

27:18.921 --> 27:20.681
-I can't.
-Why not?

27:20.801 --> 27:23.561
Well, do you think I'm really gonna leave
my girlfriend alone with you overnight?

27:23.641 --> 27:25.521
I thought she wasn't
your girlfriend.

27:25.641 --> 27:26.881
Yeah, well,
think again.

27:33.321 --> 27:34.721
Come on, babe,
let's go.

27:38.241 --> 27:41.721
-Okay, that was awesome!
-Really? You think she bought it?

27:41.801 --> 27:45.321
Are you kidding me? She thought you and I were sleeping
together when she met you at the club last week.

27:45.401 --> 27:48.321
-I defended your honor.
-I appreciate that.

27:48.521 --> 27:55.921
Are you kidding? I owe you so much now. I got my fat jeans,
I got my cd's, and who cares if I didn't get... my heart...

27:56.361 --> 27:59.081
-How did you...?
-I'm sneaky like that.

28:00.761 --> 28:04.481
And...
now you have both.

28:11.521 --> 28:14.401
No.
This one's yours.

28:29.281 --> 28:32.161
-How's it look?
-Good.

28:35.441 --> 28:39.881
-I guess we got to get you home, huh?
-No. I have a better idea.

28:44.441 --> 28:49.521
-What do you think?
-I think you're, like,the missing link between Jack Kirby and,

28:49.601 --> 28:51.961
-I don't know, Eric White.
-Hey, thanks, man.

28:52.641 --> 28:53.481
Zach?

28:55.601 --> 28:57.201
That is it, I am
pulling the plug.

28:57.281 --> 28:58.921
You were supposed to pick me up over
an hour ago!

28:59.001 --> 29:01.721
-I know, I'm sorry, but Seth and I were just...
-I don't want to hear it.

29:01.801 --> 29:03.201
What, are you guys,
like, cavalier and gay?

29:03.281 --> 29:05.761
-That was funny.
-I know.

29:06.081 --> 29:08.521
Uh, I'm sorry.
Listen, Seth, I'll call you.

29:08.801 --> 29:10.841
-We're leaving.
-Wait-wait-whoa-whoa, no, we're not.

29:11.401 --> 29:14.801
Is that supposed to be Marissa?
Cohen, did you do these?

29:16.721 --> 29:19.481
Is that Ryan?
Captain Oats?

29:20.441 --> 29:21.441
Is that you?

29:23.241 --> 29:23.881
Well...

29:27.441 --> 29:28.241
Where am I?

29:29.561 --> 29:30.521
Not finished yet.

29:30.761 --> 29:34.561
Just wanted to get the attitude right.
There's a lot of attitude.

29:35.321 --> 29:37.001
I think we made some
good progress today.

29:37.361 --> 29:38.921
It's definitely keeping
my mind off girls.

29:39.201 --> 29:41.921
Keep talking comics, Cohen, I don't think girls
will be an issue ever again.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.641
Ah, she's so supportive--
that's why I like her.

29:44.801 --> 29:48.161
-Shoot! I left my purse upstairs. I'll be right back.
-We're gonna miss the movie.

29:48.321 --> 29:49.201
Whose fault is that?

29:56.801 --> 30:01.241
Oh! Ooh, sorry, Captain Oats.
Hope you don't pull up lame.

30:19.921 --> 30:23.521
-Come on, Summ, we're gonna be late.
-What are you doing up there?

30:27.721 --> 30:28.281
Oh, thank you.

30:32.841 --> 30:39.841
Um... so, thank you so much for calling
this afternoon and suggesting dinner.

30:40.081 --> 30:44.481
It was... Long overdue. I meant to call
you right after the holidays, but...

30:44.841 --> 30:47.441
-work has been all-consuming.
-Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

30:48.001 --> 30:50.121
I mean,
I can imagine.

30:55.961 --> 31:01.201
So, what about you, Lindsay? How is... school?
What are you studying?

31:01.401 --> 31:03.041
Hey.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic.

31:03.281 --> 31:05.241
Uh, that's okay.
We just got menus.

31:05.401 --> 31:08.761
My apologies. If I had known we were going to be three,
I'd have asked the waiter for another one.

31:09.001 --> 31:12.041
Oh, I-I'm sorry it's my fault.
I should have said something earlier.

31:12.161 --> 31:15.001
Nonsense. I should have assumed Ryan
would want to make himself part of this.

31:15.121 --> 31:18.921
-I asked him to come.
-Look, I can leave if you want.

31:19.041 --> 31:22.441
You've already scammed your way into one
of my daughters' lives. Why stop there?

31:22.521 --> 31:25.161
This isn't about me. Isn't it?
You set this whole thing up.

31:25.601 --> 31:28.121
-You came to my office, you show up at dinner.
-You went to his office?

31:28.321 --> 31:31.441
-I was just trying to help.
-He said that you wanted a relationship with me,

31:31.521 --> 31:35.321
but if that were true, he wouldn't be here,
so, what is it that the two of you really want?

31:35.881 --> 31:36.321
Money?

31:37.121 --> 31:37.881
What?

31:38.201 --> 31:39.001
A new car?

31:39.681 --> 31:40.841
An ivy league education.

31:41.801 --> 31:44.401
Have your accomplice here drop by my office
with a list of demands.

31:44.641 --> 31:45.561
That should cover it.

31:46.321 --> 31:46.921
Good night.

31:49.841 --> 31:57.361
Hey, Mark, it's Sandy Cohen again. I know this is my fifth message today,
but I'm still up, so if you get this, please call bac

31:57.601 --> 31:58.281
Thanks.

31:59.721 --> 32:00.961
You going to stay
up all night?

32:01.401 --> 32:04.161
-Well, I'm not tired, that's for sure.
-No word from your lawyer friend?

32:04.401 --> 32:09.001
No. And no
confirmation she's dead.

32:09.801 --> 32:10.841
What if she's not?

32:11.801 --> 32:15.401
What if your suspicions are right?
One way or another, she's gone.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.441
What is it going to take
for you to let her go?

32:17.521 --> 32:20.201
-What are you talking about?
-Rebecca Blume.

32:20.681 --> 32:26.961
The smart, political Jewish woman that you were
supposed to marry before you ended up with me.

32:27.641 --> 32:28.721
You're still in love with her.

32:35.281 --> 32:36.361
That is not true.

32:36.881 --> 32:37.881
Then come to bed.

32:49.761 --> 32:50.961
Hello. Mark.

32:51.401 --> 32:55.441
Hey. I-I'm sorry to be harassing you,
but, you know, time's of the, uh...

32:59.321 --> 32:59.961
Oh.

33:02.001 --> 33:02.801
No kidding.

33:06.641 --> 33:07.881
Well,
thanks for calling back.

33:08.801 --> 33:09.721
All right,
take care.

33:18.201 --> 33:19.241
She's dead.

33:45.720 --> 33:49.200
-What are you going to do?
-I got to call the professor, but I...

33:49.840 --> 33:51.160
oh, I can't tell him this
on the phone.

33:51.920 --> 33:52.720
I'm sorry.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.160
It was a long time ago.

33:58.960 --> 34:00.800
Maybe I need
to let go of her, too.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.800
I'm going to go.
I won't be long.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.280
Princess Sparkle, you are
not going to believe this.

35:08.120 --> 35:08.760
I'm sorry.

35:09.560 --> 35:13.360
-Why are you sorry?
-'Cause I made you come to dinner, and I know how much you hate him.

35:13.440 --> 35:17.240
-I don't hate him.
-Yeah, well, he hates you.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.640
-So for you to have gone to his office for me was...
-A mistake.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.800
I really didn't want
anything from him.

35:29.120 --> 35:32.240
I just wanted to ask him
some questions, you know?

35:33.240 --> 35:34.400
Stupid stuff.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.760
Maybe I don't need a dad.

35:40.960 --> 35:44.640
You know, I've... gone
all this time without one.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.160
I turned out okay.

35:49.400 --> 35:50.040
Right?

35:57.840 --> 35:59.440
-Maybe I could talk to him.
-No.

35:59.520 --> 36:00.640
-Or ask Kirsten to talk to him.
-No.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.920
You've done enough.

36:03.760 --> 36:08.520
More than enough. And you said it
yourself, he's not a good guy.

36:08.680 --> 36:11.040
Yeah, but he's your dad.
You sure I can't...

36:11.160 --> 36:13.640
I'm sure.
But thanks.

36:37.880 --> 36:40.000
Let me just change my shirt,
then we can get out of here.

36:40.160 --> 36:41.680
Your shirt is fine,
I'm telling you.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.440
Then why is it sticking to me?

36:44.960 --> 36:47.120
-Am I bleeding?
-Let me see.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.480
Oh, wow.
No, you're not bleeding.

36:51.680 --> 36:54.480
-See for yourself.
-Oh, my God.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.240
Oh, my God.
What have you done?

36:58.680 --> 37:01.120
Nothing.
Get out of here, Caleb.

37:01.200 --> 37:05.120
-This is my house, my home.
-Fine. You know what then, we'll leave.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.200
-You're not going anywhere.
-Oh, really?

37:09.640 --> 37:10.760
Are you going to stop me?

37:12.320 --> 37:14.160
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Come on, Alex.

37:15.600 --> 37:16.320
Nice house.

37:21.680 --> 37:22.320
Come in.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.240
Hey.
What are you doing here?

37:31.160 --> 37:35.160
I, um, I came to return
something that I stole.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.960
Oh.
You found it.

37:45.160 --> 37:46.000
Great.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.480
Okay, here's the thing. I know that
it's totally creepy. Okay, I know that.

37:50.560 --> 37:55.480
It was just a very long summer, and I'm sorry, and I will destroy
all of them right now. I just need to find my X-Acto knife.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.480
No, Cohen,
don't.

37:58.680 --> 38:00.200
I think
they're really good.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.320
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.600
I mean, well, the boobs
are a little big, but...

38:04.760 --> 38:06.520
well, I mean,
aren't they?

38:06.960 --> 38:11.440
-I can redo the boobs.
-And, you know, I... I'm not so sure about the mask either.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.680
-Now that's what I'm talking about.
-Yeah?

38:24.160 --> 38:28.560
-So then you don't mind?
-No. Well, not as long as I have boob approval.

38:29.720 --> 38:30.400
Okay.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.280
Do you mind if I, uh,
have one of these?

38:35.040 --> 38:37.960
Uh, yeah, sure, go ahead. You can
actually have them all, if you want.

38:38.280 --> 38:43.240
Although, maybe it's not such a good
idea to tell Zach about them all.

38:44.120 --> 38:45.280
Or any of them.

38:45.440 --> 38:49.040
-I was just thinking the same thing.
-Yeah, just 'cause, you know, it might upset the partnership and...

38:49.120 --> 38:51.200
-Well, it could be bad for business.
-Exactly.

38:56.760 --> 39:01.320
Okay. I'm going to let you get back to work
because I expect my own action figure by Christmukkah.

39:01.400 --> 39:06.760
-Oh. Wow. Okay. Well, I'll see what I can do.
-Thanks, Cohen.

39:36.360 --> 39:41.240
Hey, Professor. Well, any chance
you could meet me tonight?

39:41.960 --> 39:44.200
How about my office?

39:46.240 --> 39:47.040
I'll see you then.

39:56.200 --> 39:57.520
Hey.
How was dinner?

39:58.360 --> 40:00.560
I wouldn't know. Caleb took off
before we could order.

40:01.520 --> 40:03.480
-'Cause you punched him in the face?
-No.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.800
But you wanted to. I could
tell you wanted to.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.640
That's good. Hey, listen, man, he
deserved it, I'm sure.

40:09.960 --> 40:12.680
I love the guy, but come on.
He's Lex Luthor.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.600
Oh, it's my fault. I keep trying to help.
I keep making everything worse.

40:15.920 --> 40:20.120
Well, Ryan, that's what heroes do, okay.
What else are you going to do with fists of fury, homework?

40:20.400 --> 40:21.120
The dishes?

40:21.640 --> 40:26.200
-How'd it go with Zach?
-Great, until Summer came over and stole my sketchbook.

40:26.360 --> 40:27.400
What?
What'd she do?

40:27.800 --> 40:32.640
Well, I thought she was going to get a restraining order,
but it turns out, she's just going to get her own action figure.

40:33.120 --> 40:33.880
So she liked it.

40:34.160 --> 40:37.760
Yeah. Think Summer and I may be taking
a step forward in our relationship.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.520
And knowing us, Lindsay and I
will probably take a step back.

40:40.680 --> 40:44.280
Hey. So between the two of us...
We're right back where we started.

40:44.440 --> 40:46.680
Well, at least we
haven't lost any ground.

40:48.360 --> 40:49.480
Except you on me.
Here we go.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.560
Well, I see you've
got your hands full.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.480
I'm sorry to have called you
here so late.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.240
Oh, no, actually, Sanford,
I was going to call you.

41:09.920 --> 41:11.320
I have something to show you.

41:12.560 --> 41:13.200
What is it?

41:18.400 --> 41:19.440
Sandy Cohen.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.280
Rebecca.
