{\an8}(woman)
Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood"...

00:05.672 --> 00:08.041
{\an7}People are really believing
that this is your wife,

00:08.108 --> 00:09.175
{\an8}and I'm looking crazy.

00:09.242 --> 00:11.244
{\an8}That's in my past.

00:11.311 --> 00:13.480
{\an7}I asked him
about Sade twice.

00:13.546 --> 00:14.948
{\an8}(Paris)
It ain't even just Sade.

00:15.014 --> 00:16.616
{\an8}It's another female.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.485
{\an8}Anything you wanna do
from here, I'm with you.

00:18.551 --> 00:20.620
{\an8}Anybody that wants
to deal with Akbar

00:20.687 --> 00:22.021
{\an8}is gonna have
to go through me.

00:22.088 --> 00:23.890
{\an9}(Teairra)
Oh, okay.

00:22.088 --> 00:23.890
{\an5}I'm first, she's second,

00:23.957 --> 00:25.925
{\an8}and if you're dealing with us,
bitch, you're gonna be last.

00:25.992 --> 00:27.227
{\an9}I'm out.

00:27.293 --> 00:29.729
{\an8}Uh-uh, uh-uh,
uh-uh, uh-uh!

00:29.796 --> 00:32.031
{\an8}I can't wait
to see you perform.

00:29.796 --> 00:32.031
{\an7}Uh-huh.

00:32.098 --> 00:34.634
{\an7}They think they know you now,
but they have no idea.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.337
{\an7}I can't wait
to see me neither.

00:37.404 --> 00:39.806
{\an8}People act like just because
I'm bisexual or gay,

00:39.873 --> 00:41.207
{\an8}I can't rap.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.909
{\an8}I know I have talent,
and it's time to show it.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.111
{\an8}(woman)
Next, I have someone
very special.

00:45.178 --> 00:46.746
{\an8}He goes by the name
of JayWill,

00:46.813 --> 00:49.783
{\an8}but tonight, we're gonna be
meeting him as Kandie.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.585
{\an8}(RoccStar)
What runway did you
show up off of?

00:52.652 --> 00:54.721
{\an7}(Lyrica)
This is what single
is looking like.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.222
{\an8}Did you break up
with A1?

00:56.289 --> 00:58.725
{\an8}That's a wrap.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.725
{\an8}Shut the hell up!

00:58.792 --> 01:00.660
{\an8}(Ray J)
Just say it to me,
"Whatever happened

01:00.727 --> 01:01.928
{\an8}with me and Lyrica
shouldn't have happened."

01:01.995 --> 01:04.431
{\an7}Like, I didn't mean for it
to happen, it's just--

01:04.497 --> 01:05.598
{\an8}Why did you do that?

01:05.665 --> 01:07.700
{\an8}So, what's up,
man, like...

01:07.767 --> 01:09.736
{\an7}A1, do you-- do you really
think I would do that?

01:09.803 --> 01:11.604
{\an8}Did you do that,
is what I'm asking.

01:11.671 --> 01:13.840
{\an7}I don't know what's going on
in y'all relationship,

01:13.907 --> 01:16.042
{\an8}but leave me out of it.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.611
{\an8}So, y'all--
y'all fix...

What the (bleep) is
going on?

01:54.247 --> 01:55.849
No, what the (bleep)
is going on?

01:55.915 --> 01:58.685
{\an5}No, no, no listen--

01:55.915 --> 01:58.685
I'm not gonna do this

01:58.751 --> 02:00.720
{\an5}What the (bleep)
is going on?!

01:58.751 --> 02:00.720
{\an1}Ooh.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.755
Why the (bleep) did
Princess just tell me

02:02.822 --> 02:04.657
that you told him
that we (bleep)?

02:04.724 --> 02:05.925
{\an8}I didn't say that.

02:05.992 --> 02:07.327
(Brooke)
No, no, no, no, Lyrica.

02:07.393 --> 02:08.961
{\an5}What the (bleep)
is going on?

02:07.393 --> 02:08.961
No, no, no, no.

02:09.027 --> 02:10.763
{\an5}Spit it out
your (bleep) mouth.

02:09.027 --> 02:10.763
You are pregnant.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.398
All of a sudden, you can't
(bleep) talk, Safaree?

02:12.465 --> 02:14.400
Say it right now,
what the (bleep) happened,

02:14.467 --> 02:16.336
right the (bleep) now!

02:16.402 --> 02:18.538
{\an5}I don't-- I--

02:16.402 --> 02:18.538
Ray, did Safaree
say that to you?

02:18.605 --> 02:20.640
Ray, yes or no?

02:20.707 --> 02:22.175
You said you sent her
a (bleep) pic.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.511
(Lyrica)
You said that?

02:24.577 --> 02:25.812
(Brooke)
Now, you know I'm here

02:25.879 --> 02:28.047
and I am pulling
for A1 and Lyrica,

02:28.114 --> 02:29.983
but this is messy as hell.

02:30.049 --> 02:31.985
There's a little tension
in this room,

02:32.051 --> 02:33.219
but I tell you one thing.

02:33.286 --> 02:35.755
Nobody's looking innocent
up in here.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.291
{\an5}(Ray J)
And I said,
did you smash or didn't you?

02:38.358 --> 02:40.560
{\an1}And if you did, just admit it,
just say you did it.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.962
What did you do?
Explain to me what you did.

02:43.029 --> 02:44.931
{\an5}I didn't say-- listen.

02:43.029 --> 02:44.931
What my body did,
'cause I'm confused.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.400
{\an4}Listen.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.400
Explain to me how this went.

02:47.467 --> 02:50.570
{\an1}When I spoke to Ray,
and Ray was telling me

02:50.637 --> 02:52.171
{\an1}just all the talks
and everything

02:52.238 --> 02:53.973
that was going on,
I'm just like, yo.

02:54.040 --> 02:58.311
{\an4}I ain't know none of this
was even being said
when you told me...

02:58.378 --> 03:00.346
You sound like you talking
in circles, bro.

03:00.413 --> 03:01.748
I need you
to black and white.

03:01.814 --> 03:02.949
I mean, you gotta
think about it.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.084
They-- they 'bout
to have a baby.

03:05.151 --> 03:07.153
Now, with all this (bleep),
that could be your baby.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.689
{\an5}Like, is that your baby?

03:07.220 --> 03:09.689
Yo!

03:09.756 --> 03:11.157
{\an5}No, no, no, I'm--

03:09.756 --> 03:11.157
What you're not gonna do--

03:11.224 --> 03:12.425
{\an5}Come on, Ray.

03:11.224 --> 03:12.425
No, what I'm saying is--

03:12.492 --> 03:13.927
Ray, what you're not
gonna do--

03:13.993 --> 03:15.261
That's what I'm trying
to have him admit it.

03:15.328 --> 03:16.863
{\an1}Listen, I don't know
what's going on

03:16.930 --> 03:18.131
in y'all relationship,

03:18.197 --> 03:19.766
{\an1}or whatever y'all
got going on,

03:19.832 --> 03:21.301
{\an1}but leave me
out of it, okay?

03:21.367 --> 03:22.368
What you mean?

03:22.435 --> 03:23.670
Y'all-- y'all fix every--

03:27.907 --> 03:29.142
{\an1}(man)
I got you.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.177
{\an8}Last time in the parking lot
with Safaree,

03:31.244 --> 03:33.179
{\an8}I was ready to take
his (bleep) head off.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.381
But this time,
I'm being patient.

03:35.448 --> 03:37.784
But he ain't saying nothing,
he's just dancing around.

03:37.850 --> 03:38.818
And I'm sick of it.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.587
You took too long, bro.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.655
{\an1}So, because I took long,
you're gonna climb on the table

03:42.722 --> 03:44.357
{\an1}like a wild,
raging animal?

03:44.424 --> 03:46.192
{\an5}That's what you deserve.

03:44.424 --> 03:46.192
You supposed
to be my brother.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.227
{\an5}You wait that long?

03:46.259 --> 03:48.227
That's what you get
for lying on your (bleep).

03:48.294 --> 03:50.530
{\an5}I'm sitting here
patiently waiting.

03:48.294 --> 03:50.530
That's what you get.

03:50.597 --> 03:52.065
That's what you get
for lying on your (bleep).

03:52.131 --> 03:54.467
Ray, come on.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.669
{\an1}Let's go, man, come on.
Safaree, come on.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.605
Just make sure y'all invite me
to the baby shower.

03:58.671 --> 04:01.007
I'm still y'all
brother, okay?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.041
That's what you get
for lying on your (bleep).

04:02.108 --> 04:03.509
{\an1}(Safaree)
I would never do that.

04:03.576 --> 04:07.146
{\an4}(Marcus)
You all right, bro?

04:03.576 --> 04:07.146
{\an3}(scoffs)

04:07.213 --> 04:09.282
{\an3}Bro...

04:09.349 --> 04:12.051
That's cat, bro.

04:12.118 --> 04:13.953
I'm mad at Ray.
Where Ray at?

04:14.020 --> 04:16.422
{\an7}Ray-- Ray--
Ray ain't do that.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.224
{\an7}I don't think
this a Ray thing.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.160
Keeping it 100, I don't feel
like Ray is the one

04:21.226 --> 04:22.362
that A1 should be mad at.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.430
Safaree up here
hemming and hawing,

04:24.497 --> 04:27.033
and doing everything except for
giving us a straight answer.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.869
{\an5}From where I'm sitting,
the question seemed
pretty simple.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.372
And the fact that you
could not answer that question,

04:32.438 --> 04:34.007
yo, that's really
all you need.

04:34.073 --> 04:35.341
{\an8}Bro, I'm not gonna lie.

04:35.408 --> 04:36.576
{\an8}For you to be
a married man,

04:36.643 --> 04:38.978
{\an8}you really just got me
in some old bull(bleep).

04:39.045 --> 04:40.880
{\an8}This dude just jumped
over the table

04:40.947 --> 04:42.415
{\an8}like a wild hyena.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.350
{\an5}About to beat you up.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.350
And I-- and I said--

04:44.417 --> 04:46.686
He would've got his ass beat,
that's what would've happened.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.488
{\an5}Don't make me laugh, man.

04:46.753 --> 04:48.488
{\an3}Bro.

04:48.554 --> 04:49.989
Come on, and now
you come telling me

04:50.056 --> 04:51.991
they had a baby
on the way?

04:52.058 --> 04:54.193
I just hope the baby
don't look like you.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.362
(forced chuckling)

04:58.297 --> 05:00.466
{\an7}Lyrica...

05:00.533 --> 05:01.801
{\an8}Like, come on, Brooke.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.002
You know I'm gonna keep it
all the way 100 with you.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.004
That looked crazy as (bleep).

05:05.071 --> 05:07.206
{\an5}That looked like...

05:05.071 --> 05:07.206
{\an3}As (bleep).

05:07.273 --> 05:08.841
{\an1}...y'all had sex,
and he's just afraid

05:08.908 --> 05:09.942
{\an1}to say it in front
of everybody.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.444
I wanna know.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.379
{\an1}Did you have sex
with Safaree?

05:13.446 --> 05:14.447
You are not asking me that.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.582
{\an7}I've never known Ray
to be a liar.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.484
{\an1}You're not checking on me to
come out here and ask me that.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.453
{\an5}Because I don't even know.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.453
You know that I haven't
done nothing like that.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.689
{\an1}It's A1's baby?
You never slept with Safaree?

05:22.755 --> 05:24.223
{\an6}Girl...

05:22.755 --> 05:24.223
Let's go find your husband.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.958
Girl, the fact that you
keep trying to play,

05:26.025 --> 05:27.560
'cause I'll end up
smacking you.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.295
You still messy as (bleep).

05:29.362 --> 05:31.464
Hey, come back!

05:31.531 --> 05:32.899
Brooke, decide what
you're gonna do.

05:32.965 --> 05:34.734
You either believe me
and you're gonna back me up,

05:34.801 --> 05:36.569
or you're gonna run around
in here instigating

05:36.636 --> 05:37.603
like the rumor is true.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.272
Pick a side,
'cause right now

05:39.338 --> 05:40.807
you looking real two-faced
to me.

05:40.873 --> 05:44.544
At this point, it's me
and A1 against the world.

05:44.610 --> 05:48.981
Listen, don't let ignorance
come in between our (bleep).

05:49.048 --> 05:51.884
{\an1}Hey, let's take
a lie detector test.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.220
{\an5}Oh, (bleep).

05:51.951 --> 05:54.220
It's just one question.

05:54.287 --> 05:56.389
Messy Brooke!

05:56.456 --> 05:57.990
I just said-- (bleep).

05:58.057 --> 05:59.792
{\an5}That's not fair,
what'd she say?

05:58.057 --> 05:59.792
Oh, God can't even help me!

05:59.859 --> 06:03.496
Do you need to take a test,
or do you just believe me?

06:03.563 --> 06:05.131
No, I don't believe
in that (bleep).

06:05.198 --> 06:09.368
{\an7}Okay, so there it is.
I love you.

06:09.435 --> 06:12.638
{\an7}Baby, it's okay,
you don't need to be mad.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.574
{\an8}(Marcus)
Shh!

06:20.179 --> 06:23.483
She really (bleep) the (bleep)
outta this (bleep), goddamn!

06:23.549 --> 06:26.152
{\an8}(Jamila Mustafa)
Teairra Mari sex tape leaked.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.355
{\an8}What a nightmare to have someone
you thought you could trust

06:29.422 --> 06:30.723
{\an8}expose you on the Internet

06:30.790 --> 06:33.159
{\an8}as TT's Instagram account
was recently hacked

06:33.226 --> 06:35.194
{\an8}by her alleged ex-lover.

06:35.261 --> 06:36.863
{\an8}The posts were
pretty graphic,

06:36.929 --> 06:38.831
{\an8}including one of what
appeared to be Teairra

06:38.898 --> 06:41.134
{\an8}with his aftermath
on her face.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.636
{\an8}The man in question
is reportedly named Akbar.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.805
{\an4}There's a lot
going on right now.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.805
{\an3}Let me see.

06:45.872 --> 06:48.775
{\an1}Something about Teairra's
Instagram was hacked.

06:48.841 --> 06:52.345
{\an5}Oh, that's so shady.

06:48.841 --> 06:52.345
It's super (bleep) shady.

06:52.411 --> 06:53.846
Did you see them pictures
of Teairra?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.047
{\an1}Was she (bleep)
a (bleep)?

06:55.114 --> 06:56.716
But your makeup
look cute with it.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.384
{\an1}Ha!

06:58.451 --> 07:01.754
I seen her, all kinda
white residue right here.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.990
It's going too far.

07:04.056 --> 07:06.993
{\an8}♪♪

07:11.998 --> 07:13.299
{\an9}(Nikki)
Hey, P.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.767
{\an7}So much (bleep)
going on!

07:14.834 --> 07:16.402
{\an9}What?

07:16.469 --> 07:19.038
{\an7}Did you not see
the (bleep) video

07:19.105 --> 07:21.274
{\an7}of Teairra and Akbar
all over social media?

07:21.340 --> 07:23.743
{\an8}(Paris)
I set up to have drinks
with Nikki

07:23.810 --> 07:25.511
{\an8}so I could let her know
what's been going on

07:25.578 --> 07:27.346
{\an8}with Akbar and his girls
coming at us.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.582
But then I checked the blogs
and social media,

07:29.649 --> 07:31.217
and they had other plans
for my day.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.553
{\an8}TT's really back
showcasing her talent,

07:33.619 --> 07:36.489
{\an8}just not the type her friends
were hoping for.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.292
This is bad because
we stirred up all of this.

07:39.358 --> 07:41.360
Now, TT's not answering
my text messages,

07:41.427 --> 07:42.762
she's not answering
my calls.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.564
This is crazy.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.600
{\an7}We should be seeing
TT on the mic,
not rocking it.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.002
I honestly think it's revenge
for what we did the other day.

07:50.069 --> 07:51.070
What did y'all do?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.238
Bitch, we went to his house.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.940
{\an1}It just went all left,
and it's weird

07:54.006 --> 07:55.007
that after that happened,

07:55.074 --> 07:56.876
{\an1}now this (bleep)
is on social media.

07:56.943 --> 07:58.411
{\an5}You get what I'm saying?

07:56.943 --> 07:58.411
We didn't cause this
though, so...

07:58.477 --> 08:00.713
{\an1}No, I know we didn't
cause it, but goddamn!

08:00.780 --> 08:03.950
But my whole thing, get to
know who you dealing with.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.585
Listen, your feelings
are your feelings.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.353
{\an1}But nobody believes in that?
Or at-- at least--

08:07.420 --> 08:09.255
{\an1}I mean, I already-- I've been
through that too, but...

08:09.322 --> 08:11.457
{\an4}I get it, but I'm saying,
y'all don't get to know
these (bleep),

08:11.524 --> 08:13.226
{\an5}these guys y'all deal with.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.226
I did, I (bleep)--

08:13.292 --> 08:15.862
{\an5}(Nikki)
This whole sex tape thing
is becoming too much.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.164
I've had to deal with
my own sex tape nonsense,

08:18.231 --> 08:20.166
and it's not something
I wanna revisit.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.868
The last thing
I need is to get myself

08:21.934 --> 08:24.103
in a situation with Akbar.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.772
I've got a lot to lose,
my family has a lot to lose,

08:26.839 --> 08:29.609
and to be honest, I just don't
need to be part of it.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.944
{\an1}It's just like,
I just saw right through him.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.546
{\an5}It's like she really blind.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.546
{\an3}Me too!

08:33.613 --> 08:35.481
{\an1}You know, I would see
pictures on her page of him.

08:35.548 --> 08:37.515
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

08:35.548 --> 08:37.515
She told me
she never posted it.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.652
So, it's like, did he have
her password still?

08:39.719 --> 08:42.520
{\an5}He done been had that.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.520
Either way, she should not
let him have those videos.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.056
{\an3}(bleep)

08:42.587 --> 08:44.056
Right? At all!

08:44.123 --> 08:45.758
{\an1}And delete (bleep) if you not
(bleep) with him no more.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.526
{\an5}Yeah, but like--

08:45.825 --> 08:47.526
But you know what,
let me tell you something.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.462
Time heals everything,
so I know she'll be okay.

08:49.528 --> 08:51.998
{\an1}But it's just like, to, like,
really care for somebody

08:52.064 --> 08:53.499
and they do that to you,
is really hurtful.

08:55.968 --> 08:59.005
{\an1}Like, it ain't
no coming back from this.

08:59.071 --> 09:00.506
{\an8}(man)
Coming up...

09:00.573 --> 09:02.008
{\an8}(Treiva)
Run me through
how this happened.

09:02.074 --> 09:03.442
{\an7}They called me and said
some girl is coming

09:03.509 --> 09:04.777
{\an8}breaking your windows
right now.

09:04.844 --> 09:06.846
{\an8}Yeah, I positively did,

09:06.913 --> 09:10.049
{\an7}after you (bleep) put that
(bleep) revenge porn out on me.

09:10.116 --> 09:12.718
{\an7}You know, A1 my people.
Lyrica my people.

09:12.785 --> 09:15.855
{\an7}So, yeah, I hit Safaree
with the, "Did you smash?"

09:15.922 --> 09:19.125
{\an8}Hey, I got some more
information for you.

09:19.191 --> 09:21.727
{\an8}Ain't nothing wrong with
a brother need fade, fam.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.996
{\an8}So, (bleep)...

{\an8}Hold up, bro.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.531
{\an8}But first-- wait, hold on.

09:25.598 --> 09:26.666
{\an8}Wait, how you talking?

09:26.732 --> 09:28.267
{\an8}Easy.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.267
{\an9}(bleep).

09:28.334 --> 09:30.303
{\an8}Look, look, look.

09:34.707 --> 09:38.177
{\an8}♪♪

09:38.244 --> 09:41.447
{\an7}Man, this crazy, man.
This is crazy, man.

09:45.851 --> 09:47.653
{\an7}(Treiva)
Run me through
how this all started,

09:47.720 --> 09:49.088
{\an8}how this happened.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.057
{\an1}I was-- I was in the house,
and I got a phone call

09:51.123 --> 09:52.892
from the condo people.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.827
They called me and said
some girl is coming,

09:54.894 --> 09:56.228
breaking your windows
right now.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.797
{\an4}Okay.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.797
And I-- and I--
and they called me up,

09:57.863 --> 10:01.033
{\an5}and I came downstairs,
she was gone.

09:57.863 --> 10:01.033
{\an1}Okay.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.468
{\an8}So she bust two windows
in that one,

10:02.535 --> 10:04.303
{\an8}and she bust
most of these out.

10:04.370 --> 10:05.972
{\an8}But this is the car
that I had for her.

10:06.038 --> 10:07.940
Teairra, you bust
all my car windows.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.475
For what reason?

10:09.542 --> 10:12.845
{\an1}Yeah, I absolutely
mother(bleep) positively did,

10:12.912 --> 10:15.047
{\an1}after you (bleep) put that
(bleep) revenge porn out on me.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.216
{\an4}Lying, you can lie on camera?
That's great, you can
sit here and lie.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.652
(Teairra)
After that whole confrontation

10:19.719 --> 10:21.420
with him
and his two concubines,

10:21.487 --> 10:24.957
I text him and I ask him,
why would you do that to me?

10:25.024 --> 10:27.159
He text me
some shady (bleep) back,

10:27.226 --> 10:29.729
and the next morning,
I wake up to this porn tape

10:29.795 --> 10:32.531
and it's all over
the (bleep) Internet.

10:32.598 --> 10:33.532
{\an8}I didn't do nothing.

10:33.599 --> 10:35.167
{\an8}Yes, you did, like...

10:35.234 --> 10:38.738
{\an7}Of course that why
I did it!

10:38.804 --> 10:40.873
{\an7}What you mean,
is that why I did it?

10:40.940 --> 10:43.109
I text Akbar last night,
and I told him,

10:43.175 --> 10:44.677
you got me (bleep) up,

10:44.744 --> 10:46.512
I don't want any parts
of your harem.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.315
And then he text me
and said,

10:49.382 --> 10:52.084
"Teairra, somebody stole
my phone

10:52.151 --> 10:53.486
with our sex tapes in it."

10:53.552 --> 10:56.088
Next thing I know, I wake up
at my girlfriend's house

10:56.155 --> 10:58.557
and the whole (bleep)
is on the Internet.

10:58.624 --> 11:00.760
{\an8}No.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.161
{\an7}(Teairra)
Yes!

11:02.228 --> 11:04.030
{\an7}You were the only person
that had them.

11:04.096 --> 11:05.498
Somebody told me
they released it on your page.

11:05.564 --> 11:06.532
How it get on your page?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.567
{\an1}'Cause you had
my password.

11:08.634 --> 11:10.036
You lying again!

11:10.102 --> 11:11.437
{\an5}So how did anybody get--

11:10.102 --> 11:11.437
You called me--

11:11.504 --> 11:12.638
How did anybody get it?

11:12.705 --> 11:14.006
{\an5}I don't know.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.006
I'm asking.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.374
{\an5}I don't know how
somebody got it.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.374
How don't you know

11:15.441 --> 11:16.876
{\an1}when you were the only one
that had it?

11:16.942 --> 11:18.477
You-- me and you
both had it.

11:18.544 --> 11:21.447
{\an1}(scoffs)
Are you kidding me?

11:21.514 --> 11:24.250
{\an4}You think I would put some
(bleep) out there
like that on me?

11:24.316 --> 11:25.885
I didn't say--
I'm not accusing you.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.954
{\an4}All right, so I'm asking you,
who else could have had it?

11:25.951 --> 11:28.954
(scoffs)

11:29.021 --> 11:30.689
(Teairra)
This is unbelievable.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.625
Now this manipulating
mother(bleep)

11:32.691 --> 11:35.694
is accusing me of leaking
the sex tape myself.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.831
I was furious,
but now I'm way beyond that.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.566
And he's gonna learn
what happens

11:40.633 --> 11:43.235
when you push Teairra
too far.

11:43.302 --> 11:44.970
You kept letting people
get in your head

11:45.037 --> 11:46.806
{\an5}and talk to you about me
instead of letting me
talk to you.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.307
I forgave you for busting
my car windows.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.609
And I for-- ahh!

11:50.676 --> 11:54.180
{\an1}Do you understand?
Nobody is ever gonna see

11:54.246 --> 11:57.183
{\an1}those busted (bleep) car
dumb-ass windows,

11:57.249 --> 11:59.251
but everybody's gonna see

11:59.318 --> 12:00.753
{\an1}the porno
that you put out on me.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.021
I didn't do that.

12:02.088 --> 12:03.789
{\an5}Teairra, do you love me?

12:02.088 --> 12:03.789
I wanna say...

12:03.856 --> 12:05.658
Do you love me?

12:05.724 --> 12:06.859
{\an5}Do you love me?

12:05.724 --> 12:06.859
Not no more.

12:06.926 --> 12:08.360
You don't love me anymore.

12:08.427 --> 12:09.962
In my mind,
you still my woman.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.764
{\an4}No!

12:10.029 --> 12:11.764
We gonna get over this.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.165
This is crazy.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.500
This too,
we shall overcome.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.335
{\an1}Ha!

12:16.402 --> 12:19.238
{\an8}The storm'll go,
we'll let it blow over.

12:19.305 --> 12:22.575
{\an8}Let it blow over, Teairra.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.110
{\an8}(man)
Coming up...

12:24.176 --> 12:27.046
{\an7}I feel like I can't get
a moment of peace.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.582
{\an7}We just gotta stop
entertaining outside people.

12:29.648 --> 12:31.550
{\an8}(JayWill)
You know, I love Kandie,
it's creative, it's fun.

12:31.617 --> 12:34.520
{\an8}But I just wanna show
I have more to give.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.288
{\an7}First of all, how do you feel
about suing them?

12:36.355 --> 12:39.225
{\an7}I feel like
that's the best bet.

No disrespect,
but it is so hard to focus

13:16.996 --> 13:19.165
because of the bombshell
that the blogs just dropped.

13:19.231 --> 13:21.267
Someone just leaked a tape
of Teairra Mari

13:21.333 --> 13:22.368
and her boo, Akbar.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.403
This thing has gone viral.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.639
What you looking at?

13:26.705 --> 13:29.742
{\an1}These (bleep) photos
of Teairra

13:29.808 --> 13:30.910
that got leaked today.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.811
I seen that
on my way over here.

13:32.878 --> 13:34.780
I hate how they
exploiting her.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.015
I feel like
that's not right.

13:36.081 --> 13:39.919
{\an1}I think it's super wack
to expose the woman

13:39.985 --> 13:41.287
that you say you love.

13:41.353 --> 13:44.490
{\an1}I feel super strong about it
'cause it happened to me.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.192
{\an5}I just handled it a lot--

13:44.557 --> 13:46.192
Was it hard to get through?

13:46.258 --> 13:48.227
{\an1}Yeah!
Like, what's even crazier

13:48.294 --> 13:50.896
{\an1}is she and I aren't
even speaking, really.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.364
Wasn't y'all cool?

13:52.431 --> 13:54.500
{\an1}I mean, that was-- she was
one of my best friends,

13:54.567 --> 13:56.468
{\an1}and I still love her
like a sister.

13:56.535 --> 13:57.937
I'ma be honest,
what I had to learn,

13:58.003 --> 13:59.305
like, sometimes
with a friendship,

13:59.371 --> 14:00.739
{\an1}gotta be the bigger person.
I think, you know,

14:00.806 --> 14:02.441
if she really did mean
that much to you,

14:02.508 --> 14:04.510
{\an5}in a moment like this,
I think you should
reach out to her.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.412
Anyways, on a more
positive note,

14:06.478 --> 14:08.047
I got this little
audition or whatever.

14:08.113 --> 14:09.915
Ooh, for what?

14:08.113 --> 14:09.915
{\an3}Pride.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.250
Misster Ray,
he invited me.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.818
{\an1}Okay, so are we gonna
get excited?

14:12.885 --> 14:13.953
Like, whoo!

14:14.019 --> 14:16.922
Pride is a huge event in LA

14:16.989 --> 14:18.591
that celebrates
the LGBT community.

14:18.657 --> 14:21.527
And I have a big audition
to perform as Kandie,

14:21.594 --> 14:24.296
my drag character,
at one of the events.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.165
But I ain't celebrating
just yet.

14:26.232 --> 14:28.167
{\an1}Why aren't we excited?
What the (bleep)?

14:28.234 --> 14:29.768
Kandie already
performed at Pride.

14:29.835 --> 14:31.637
You know, I love Kandie,
it's creative, it's fun.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.472
But I just wanna show
I have more to--

14:33.539 --> 14:35.007
I have more to give.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.575
{\an1}You know, when Kandie blew up,
they all wanted to be me,

14:36.642 --> 14:38.344
then, like, people started
switching up on me.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.412
It-- it set me through,
like, a depression.

14:40.479 --> 14:42.281
{\an1}And I started-- you know how
I kinda got through it,

14:42.348 --> 14:43.816
I, um... I just
started writing...

14:43.882 --> 14:45.684
{\an4}Right.

14:43.882 --> 14:45.684
...music for JayWill.

14:45.751 --> 14:47.019
{\an5}When I was
writing that music,
I wasn't trying to prove

14:47.086 --> 14:48.687
I can rap or prove
this is dope.

14:48.754 --> 14:50.823
{\an5}I just told how I felt,
and the music
came out amazing.

14:50.889 --> 14:54.226
{\an1}There's definitely
space for you to be Kandie

14:54.293 --> 14:56.262
{\an1}and there's space for you
to be JayWill.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.330
I think that's why
it's so important

14:58.397 --> 15:00.532
{\an1}when you have
the platform you have

15:00.599 --> 15:03.002
{\an1}to show them that you
can do this,

15:03.068 --> 15:06.705
{\an4}but it's equally as freeing
to just be you.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.705
{\an3}Yourself.

15:06.772 --> 15:09.875
I invented Kandie because
Kandie can express things

15:09.942 --> 15:12.344
that I can't as JayWill.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.812
This means so much to me.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.381
{\an1}I usually don't do
charity events.

15:15.447 --> 15:16.782
Really, nobody is here.

15:16.849 --> 15:19.618
{\an1}All you nobodies,
thank y'all so much!

15:19.685 --> 15:21.654
Kandie can be ratchet
and raw,

15:21.720 --> 15:24.790
and JayWill is more like
poetic and mellow.

15:24.857 --> 15:27.393
That's who I am.
And since Pride is an event

15:27.459 --> 15:28.761
where you're supposed
to be yourself,

15:28.827 --> 15:30.429
I'm gonna do that this year.

15:30.496 --> 15:33.832
{\an1}Well, I say you audition
as JayWill...

15:33.899 --> 15:36.635
{\an6}Yeah.

15:33.899 --> 15:36.635
{\an1}...and shut everybody
the (bleep) up.

15:36.702 --> 15:38.237

through when I need you.

{\an8}are making fools
of themselves.

16:01.393 --> 16:04.296

would bring Safaree

{\an8}to our baby
announcement party.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.101
{\an8}But it doesn't matter.
Lyrica looked me in the eyes

16:09.168 --> 16:12.137
{\an8}and she told me what's up,
and I trust my wife.

16:12.204 --> 16:15.140
{\an8}Not Ray J,
and certainly not Safaree.

16:15.207 --> 16:18.043
{\an1}I feel like I can't get
a moment of peace.

16:18.110 --> 16:21.313
I feel like everybody
just, like, hating on us

16:21.380 --> 16:23.082
right now, for real,
for real.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.285
This is supposed to be
a happy moment of life.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.687
{\an1}I mean, we just gotta stop
entertaining outside people.

16:28.754 --> 16:30.055
Well, from this point on,

16:30.122 --> 16:31.590
{\an1}I'm not

are a united front,

'cause with a baby on the way,
it can't be no other way.

So, I want to shut down
the outside world

16:41.467 --> 16:43.035
and focus on us.

16:43.102 --> 16:45.471
But first, I feel like
I gotta check Ray

and let him know
that he dead wrong

18:10.622 --> 18:12.591
Just conflicted,

18:12.658 --> 18:14.426
{\an1}because I was
trying to give him

{\an3}Yeah.

18:20.766 --> 18:24.102
{\an1}But that's only because
I was so confused,

18:24.169 --> 18:26.271
{\an1}and I wanted
to hear something

18:26.338 --> 18:29.174
{\an1}that I knew wasn't
true from him.

18:29.241 --> 18:32.044
When the video hit,
I immediately blamed Akbar,

18:32.110 --> 18:34.546
and he told me that
he didn't do it.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.982
For a minute,
I really wanted to believe him

18:37.049 --> 18:39.284
because of how sincere
he sounded.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.520
But now, I know what it is.

18:41.587 --> 18:42.888
You know, how many
different stories

18:42.955 --> 18:44.389
do we have from Akbar
at this point?

18:44.456 --> 18:45.991
"Somebody stole
my phone."

18:46.058 --> 18:47.226
And the text message.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.061
{\an1}Oh, and I posted it too.
Let's not forget that.

18:49.127 --> 18:50.395

18:49.127 --> 18:50.395
{\an1}Yeah.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.965
{\an1}So, this a guy who can't
even get his story straight.

18:53.031 --> 18:55.434
{\an4}Yeah.

18:53.031 --> 18:55.434
And the trouble's
just beginning for him.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.369
{\an1}You know, Akbar,
he knows where I live.

18:57.436 --> 18:59.505
That's a big concern,
you should be concerned.

18:59.571 --> 19:00.639
{\an1}I just-- yeah,
I'm just like...

19:02.808 --> 19:06.011
{\an3}Yeah.

19:06.078 --> 19:09.114
{\an1}But I have to take
instant action, I feel like.

19:09.181 --> 19:11.383
{\an1}Now, people are saying
that I'm doing this to...

19:11.450 --> 19:13.151
{\an5}Yeah, that you did this--

19:11.450 --> 19:13.151
...to be relevant.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.620
Yeah, which is
so offensive.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.288
{\an5}Mm-hmm, yeah.

19:14.686 --> 19:16.288
{\an1}You know, like,
I would never

19:16.355 --> 19:18.357
{\an5}do this to myself.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.357
Right, right.

19:18.423 --> 19:20.158
Let's talk about
the legal side of this.

19:20.225 --> 19:22.694
So, revenge porn is
really the modern version

19:22.761 --> 19:24.329
of sexual assault.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.999
{\an1}It's designed to humiliate you
and embarrass you

19:27.065 --> 19:28.367
for being a sexual being.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.102
The good news is,
in California,

19:30.168 --> 19:31.970
we take revenge porn
very seriously.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.505
It's a crime,
first of all.

19:33.572 --> 19:34.706
You could go to the police

19:34.773 --> 19:36.909
and get everybody involved
arrested.

19:36.975 --> 19:38.443
You could file a lawsuit,

19:38.510 --> 19:40.145
and I can file
that lawsuit for you.

19:40.212 --> 19:43.582
It feels amazing to have
someone with such power

19:43.649 --> 19:47.252
to defend me,
because Akbar, he's wrong,

19:47.319 --> 19:49.688
and he needs to be
brought to justice.

19:49.755 --> 19:51.023
It's gonna be hard.

19:51.089 --> 19:52.357
You know, when we first
come out with this,

19:52.424 --> 19:56.194
I would suggest we have
a press conference.

19:56.261 --> 19:57.996
{\an1}So, what is the point
of the press conference?

19:58.063 --> 19:59.431
Once you file the lawsuit,

19:59.498 --> 20:01.133
everyone's gonna want
to tell your story.

20:01.199 --> 20:03.168
"Why did you do it?"
And so, you can go around

20:03.235 --> 20:05.404
{\an1}and do 50 different interviews,
and they're gonna chop it up,

20:05.470 --> 20:07.105
{\an4}and they're gonna ask
the questions they wanna ask.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.105
{\an1}Okay.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.474
Or you can tell your story
your way, one time...

20:09.541 --> 20:10.876
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.876
...and then it goes out,

20:10.943 --> 20:12.144
and you've controlled
the narrative.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.579
After the press conference,

20:13.645 --> 20:15.914
you're gonna get a lot
of social media hate.

20:15.981 --> 20:18.216
You have to be solid
in yourself.

20:18.283 --> 20:21.453
"I've thought about this,
I've gotten legal advice,

20:21.520 --> 20:22.988
"I've weighed
the pros and cons.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.289
"I'm standing up
for my rights.

20:24.356 --> 20:26.191
I'm scared,
but I'm doing it anyway."

20:26.258 --> 20:28.126
{\an4}Yeah.

20:26.258 --> 20:28.126
That's the definition
of courage.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.696
{\an1}I was conflicted
before this conversation.

20:30.762 --> 20:34.166
{\an1}But now, I'm just...
I'm-- I'm there.

20:34.232 --> 20:35.867
{\an1}I'm ready.

20:34.232 --> 20:35.867

...Lyrica's blessing?

20:45.644 --> 20:48.313

all on her chin,

20:48.380 --> 20:50.649
{\an8}ass cheeks hanging out
the bottom of the leather,

20:50.716 --> 20:53.585

all this (bleep) about A1.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.382

21:23.448 --> 21:25.217
{\an8}So, when my boy Marcus
and his girl Brooke

21:25.283 --> 21:28.086
{\an8}told me they were having
a little day party shindig,

21:28.153 --> 21:30.422
{\an8}I had to slide through to see
what kind of things

21:30.489 --> 21:33.058
{\an8}they had there, 'cause you know
Lucci love the ladies.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.661

{\an8}Check-- check me
out now, Texas.

21:39.598 --> 21:42.367
{\an4}Ohh!

21:42.434 --> 21:44.403
{\an5}That's hard!

21:42.434 --> 21:44.403
Check me out now.

21:44.469 --> 21:45.570
Say, that's hard.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.005
{\an3}Yeah.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.005
Hey, my brother.

21:47.072 --> 21:48.473
{\an8}I did what I had to do,
what I'm supposed to do.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.108
{\an5}Congratulations.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.108
You hear me?
Thank you, brother.

21:50.175 --> 21:51.677
{\an5}Yeah!

21:50.175 --> 21:51.677
You didn't do
nothing wrong.

21:51.743 --> 21:54.413
{\an4}You gonna get
that honey bun.

21:51.743 --> 21:54.413
{\an3}Oh, please.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.181
{\an1}Is you gonna glaze
the honey bun or what?

21:56.248 --> 21:59.518
Huh, have I?

21:56.248 --> 21:59.518
{\an1}Ohh!

21:59.584 --> 22:01.520
{\an5}You know,
Southern hospitality.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.520
You understand.

22:01.586 --> 22:02.854
Speaking of blessings,
you know,

22:02.921 --> 22:05.257
did you hear about, uh...
(clearing throat)

22:05.323 --> 22:08.660
...Lyrica's blessing?

22:08.727 --> 22:10.262
{\an6}Babe.

22:08.727 --> 22:10.262
And I just wanted to tell him

22:10.328 --> 22:12.064
we went to a nice dinner,
and Lyrica's pregnant.

22:12.130 --> 22:13.899
{\an5}I mean, I didn't
wanna say that Ray J...

22:12.130 --> 22:13.899
{\an3}Babe? Baby?

22:13.965 --> 22:15.734
{\an5}...told Safaree to tell A1
that he slept with his wife.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.734
{\an3}Baby!

22:15.801 --> 22:17.936
{\an5}I didn't wanna say that!

22:15.801 --> 22:17.936
{\an3}Whoa!

22:18.003 --> 22:19.905
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

22:19.971 --> 22:21.940
{\an1}She gonna always
keep it fun.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.475
Baby, we staying out
of that, you hear me?

22:23.542 --> 22:25.110
{\an5}We're-- I'm staying
out of it.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.110
{\an3}Look at me.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.344
{\an6}Look at me.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.344
Lucci, I am not telling you...

22:26.411 --> 22:27.846
{\an5}No, listen, why you...

22:26.411 --> 22:27.846
...that Safaree

22:27.913 --> 22:29.147
knocked down Lyrica,
and they don't know

22:29.214 --> 22:31.049
{\an5}who the baby is.

22:29.214 --> 22:31.049
Listen, come here.

22:31.116 --> 22:34.453
Clearly, I've been away
from my boy A1 for too long.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.888
Last time I checked,
his fam was telling him

22:36.955 --> 22:38.023
to get a divorce.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.858
And now it's a baby
in the mix,

22:39.925 --> 22:42.794
and might be another
potential baby daddy?

22:42.861 --> 22:44.930
What the (bleep)?

22:44.996 --> 22:46.832
I just know A1
feel a real way,

22:46.898 --> 22:48.433
you know what I'm saying,
about Ray.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.335
{\an1}He can't feel
no way about Ray.

22:50.402 --> 22:51.803
{\an5}But he do, though.

22:50.402 --> 22:51.803
But we can't let him.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.772
What is you saying, bro?
Like, how you...

22:53.839 --> 22:55.574
{\an1}Bro, look, the only way
to resolve this,

22:55.640 --> 22:58.877
we need to all get together
on some grown man (bleep).

22:58.944 --> 23:00.579
{\an6}Yeah.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.579
Have us a little
guys' night out.

23:00.645 --> 23:02.347
{\an3}Okay.

23:00.645 --> 23:02.347
Do a card night.

23:02.414 --> 23:03.782
(Marcus)
Brooke know I can't stand

23:03.849 --> 23:05.317
when she be all
in everybody's business.

23:05.383 --> 23:07.052
But you know, Solo is right.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.887
Maybe instead of
stirring the pot,

23:08.954 --> 23:11.223
we can help our brother
get ahold of this situation

23:11.289 --> 23:12.791
before it gets out of control.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.493
{\an1}Whoever the baby daddy is,
I'm gonna support A1.

23:14.559 --> 23:15.994
{\an5}Team A1.

23:14.559 --> 23:15.994
I mean, that's my dog.

23:16.061 --> 23:18.697
"Lafaree Safyrica--"
What's the last name?

23:18.764 --> 23:20.065
Safyrica Bentley.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.633
I told him I was gonna
stay out of that.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.102
I'm being good.
But let's talk about Teairra.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.271
{\an6}All right.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.271
{\an1}She going crazy
over that mother(bleep).

23:26.338 --> 23:28.273
Both hands, you know
what I'm saying?

23:28.340 --> 23:29.908
What, you seen it
too, Marcus.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.277
{\an5}You asked me
if I could do that.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.277
What is going on?

23:32.344 --> 23:33.879
{\an1}I was just on the Internet
the other day,

23:33.945 --> 23:35.580
{\an1}and Teairra was doing
some kind of interview.

23:35.647 --> 23:37.582
I was so confused,

23:37.649 --> 23:40.051
{\an1}because at one minute,
she was saying...

23:40.118 --> 23:42.988
{\an1}"I'm for sure this dude
put this video out of me,"

23:43.054 --> 23:45.056
{\an1}and the next second,
she was like,

23:45.123 --> 23:47.926
{\an1}"But-- yeah, but I talked
to him this-- today, or..."

23:47.993 --> 23:49.628
{\an5}What?!

23:47.993 --> 23:49.628
"But I love him."

23:49.694 --> 23:50.962
{\an4}Uh, what?

23:49.694 --> 23:50.962
What?!

23:51.029 --> 23:53.031
Oh, I gotta talk to her.
This is too much.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.800
{\an5}I can heal this situation.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.800
Yeah, but let's not be--

23:54.866 --> 23:56.868
{\an5}I don't know.

23:54.866 --> 23:56.868
Sweetheart,
let's not be intrusive,

23:56.935 --> 23:58.170
'cause I feel like
you saying--

23:58.236 --> 24:00.105
That's not intrusive.
I'm already in it, baby.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.973
{\an5}But I think you
saying something
might make it worse.

24:02.040 --> 24:05.744
Ain't none
of our business.

24:05.811 --> 24:08.747
♪♪

24:13.251 --> 24:18.056
{\an5}(Ray J)
This A1, Lyrica, Safaree
situation is a mess!

24:18.123 --> 24:20.025
{\an8}With Princess at home
about to pop,

24:20.091 --> 24:22.594
{\an8}you know I had to go shoot
some pool with my bro, RoccStar,

24:22.661 --> 24:24.930
{\an8}and you know, just get my mind
off a few things.

24:24.996 --> 24:27.532
{\an8}Listen, Hollywood
is filthy right now.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.835
{\an7}It's dirty!
It is probably

24:29.901 --> 24:31.736
{\an7}the filthiest place
to come and tour.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.773
{\an8}It's so dirty,
Teairra on the Internet

24:34.840 --> 24:36.541
{\an8}right now (bleep).

24:36.608 --> 24:38.977
On Instagram.
(bleep).

24:39.044 --> 24:40.412
She put the whole
(bleep).

24:40.478 --> 24:43.281
I said, how do I get
a hold of her?

24:43.348 --> 24:45.050
So, you might have
to text me that,

24:45.116 --> 24:47.285
but (bleep),
right now, it's filthy.

24:47.352 --> 24:48.687
{\an5}Hollywood is filled--

24:47.352 --> 24:48.687
It's disgusting.

24:48.753 --> 24:50.789
{\an5}Filled with dirty people.

24:48.753 --> 24:50.789
{\an3}It's nasty.

24:50.856 --> 24:52.157
And RoccStar...

24:50.856 --> 24:52.157
{\an3}Yeah.

24:52.224 --> 24:53.391
...is in the top five.

24:53.458 --> 24:54.593
I don't know what
you talking 'bout.

24:54.659 --> 24:55.894
What's going on
with you, though?

24:55.961 --> 24:58.263
{\an5}You know, the baby coming.

24:55.961 --> 24:58.263
The baby is coming!

24:58.330 --> 25:00.131
You know, I got
the two-year-old.

25:00.198 --> 25:01.499
Boy or girl?

25:00.198 --> 25:01.499
{\an1}Girl.

25:01.566 --> 25:03.068
{\an6}Whoo!

25:01.566 --> 25:03.068
Which I'm happy about.

25:03.134 --> 25:05.270
{\an1}But um, yeah, besides that,
you know, just--

25:05.337 --> 25:06.738
just keeping (bleep) right.

25:06.805 --> 25:08.240
{\an4}When I hear (bleep)
going on in the city...

25:06.805 --> 25:08.240
{\an3}Yeah.

25:08.306 --> 25:09.574
{\an1}and them people,
my people,

25:09.641 --> 25:11.009
{\an1}I'ma always try to come
and make peace.

25:11.076 --> 25:13.345
{\an1}You know, A1 my people,
Lyrica my people.

25:13.411 --> 25:15.947
{\an1}So, yeah, I hit Safaree
with the "Look, fam,

25:16.014 --> 25:18.817
like, did you smash?"

25:18.884 --> 25:21.786
8-ball in
the corner pocket?

25:21.853 --> 25:23.688
{\an1}Ain't no more balls
on the table.

25:23.755 --> 25:25.790
{\an6}Wow!

25:23.755 --> 25:25.790
He ain't really said--

25:25.857 --> 25:28.393
So, hey, I got some more
information for you.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.363
{\an1}So basically, what she did,
she hit me, right?

25:31.429 --> 25:32.964
And she like, "Yo,
I'm coming to see you."

25:33.031 --> 25:35.333
{\an1}And then she came with
her titties all on her chin,

25:35.400 --> 25:37.669
ass cheeks hanging out
the bottom of the leather,

25:37.736 --> 25:39.905
and start just telling me
all this (bleep) about A1.

25:39.971 --> 25:40.972
Which is wrong.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.974
It was 100,000 phone calls.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.175
Y'all was texting too?

25:44.242 --> 25:45.644
Let me (bleep) around.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.712
Do you see what
I'm talking about?

25:47.779 --> 25:51.349
{\an5}(Ray J)
I'm looking at these texts
between RoccStar and Lyrica.

25:51.416 --> 25:54.286
"You left your ring
at the house."

25:54.352 --> 25:56.288
"Don't tell A1."

25:56.354 --> 25:58.690
It looks like RoccStar
and Lyrica

25:58.757 --> 26:00.592
are more than just friends.

26:00.659 --> 26:02.093
{\an5}Listen, man...

26:00.659 --> 26:02.093
I don't wanna
do you like that.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.429
{\an1}Are you-- are you
1,000% sure?

26:04.496 --> 26:05.730
{\an5}One million percent.

26:04.496 --> 26:05.730
You sure you--

26:05.797 --> 26:07.032
{\an5}I got another--

26:05.797 --> 26:07.032
You didn't smash?

26:07.098 --> 26:09.701
100,000% you didn't smash?

26:09.768 --> 26:11.903
'Cause you could've forgot.

26:11.970 --> 26:14.339
All right, so look, man.

26:14.406 --> 26:18.209
{\an1}A1 and Lyrica
about to have a baby.

26:18.276 --> 26:22.147
Oh, (bleep).

26:22.213 --> 26:23.915
They 'bout to have
a baby?!

26:23.982 --> 26:25.650
I got a headache, fam.

26:25.717 --> 26:27.585
Yeah, me too.

26:25.717 --> 26:27.585
It's just...

26:27.652 --> 26:29.454
Is it gonna be
a "Maury" situation?

26:29.521 --> 26:31.189
{\an1}That's what I'm saying,
and if it is,

26:31.256 --> 26:32.557
{\an1}we need to get
everybody in the room,

26:32.624 --> 26:34.292
{\an1}everybody need to go ahead
and take a swab,

26:34.359 --> 26:39.998
{\an1}and then we gonna
figure out who is the father.

26:40.065 --> 26:41.499
{\an8}(man)
Coming up...

26:41.566 --> 26:43.802
{\an7}I thought you was gonna perform
as, like, Kandie for Pride.

26:43.868 --> 26:46.738
{\an7}I'm not doing it
as Kandie.

26:46.805 --> 26:49.808
{\an8}What I have to do
is go full-forward

26:49.874 --> 26:51.609
{\an8}with a (bleep) lawsuit.

26:51.676 --> 26:53.311
{\an8}Oh, so you gonna sue him?

26:53.378 --> 26:55.113
{\an7}(bleep) with
the wrong bitch.

27:01.219 --> 27:03.755
{\an8}♪♪

27:03.822 --> 27:04.923
{\an8}(applause)

27:04.990 --> 27:06.558
{\an8}That was cute!

27:04.990 --> 27:06.558
{\an7}Thank you.

27:06.624 --> 27:08.426
{\an8}That was good.

27:08.493 --> 27:09.728
{\an8}(woman)
I loved it.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.429
{\an8}I'm so nervous.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.429
{\an7}Why?

27:11.496 --> 27:13.365
{\an8}Because I just really
think that if I book

27:13.431 --> 27:16.001
this gig tonight, you know,
it'll help take my career...

27:16.067 --> 27:17.602
{\an4}Ain't no "if,"
you gonna book it,
is the first thing.

27:17.669 --> 27:19.371
Booking a Pride event is big,

27:19.437 --> 27:21.373
because if the gays love you,
you good.

27:21.439 --> 27:24.209
So, I invited my friend,
La'Britney,

27:24.275 --> 27:25.610
so she can audition too.

27:25.677 --> 27:27.846
Kandie done performed
at Prides for awhile now,

27:27.912 --> 27:29.381
he got a ton of fans.

27:29.447 --> 27:32.851
But today, I wanna make sure
that I deliver that same impact,

27:32.917 --> 27:34.185
but as JayWill.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.321
{\an1}I know you gonna kill this,
you so talented.

27:36.388 --> 27:37.922
{\an1}I'm gonna do
the best I can.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.057
{\an7}Same thing I'm telling
you to do, I'm gonna go
out there and do.

27:39.124 --> 27:40.392
{\an8}But, um, where's Kandie?

27:40.458 --> 27:42.093
{\an1}I want to try
something different.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.196
I want to kinda make sure
in addition to the growth

27:45.263 --> 27:48.299
{\an1}and evolution of Kandie,
I get back to why I started,

27:48.366 --> 27:50.468
{\an5}which is telling my story.

27:48.366 --> 27:50.468
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

27:50.535 --> 27:51.770
{\an1}And being the voice
for the community

27:51.836 --> 27:52.937
of people like myself.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.073
Listen, I'm a fan
of your talent.

27:55.140 --> 27:57.475
I've followed JayWill's music
for a while now,

27:57.542 --> 28:00.111
and he's actually turned
into a really good friend.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.280
I love his music,
and I love Kandie,

28:02.347 --> 28:04.783
so whoever he chooses
to put on stage,

28:04.849 --> 28:06.651
I know he's gonna kill it.

28:06.718 --> 28:07.986
{\an1}Get out there and kill it,
and do your little...

Yeah.

a lot of talent.

{\an5}But this angry
black man monologue
that he got going on?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.039
{\an1}Okay?

30:08.106 --> 30:09.807
But what happened to Kandie?

30:09.874 --> 30:13.011
{\an5}I thought you was gonna
perform as, like,
Kandie for Pride.

30:13.077 --> 30:16.047
{\an5}People love you as Kandie.

30:13.077 --> 30:16.047
{\an1}I've done so many Prides
as Kandie, it's old.

30:16.114 --> 30:17.182
{\an1}It's old.

30:17.248 --> 30:18.550
{\an1}Ain't a Pride day
I haven't done.

30:18.616 --> 30:22.854
I find it very hypocritical
that these judges

30:22.921 --> 30:24.455
for a Pride event,
where you're supposed

30:24.522 --> 30:26.958
to be yourself, are judging me
and not allowing me to do so.

30:27.025 --> 30:29.928
But I also know once
the world sees JayWill,

30:29.994 --> 30:31.930
y'all ain't gonna be able
to get enough.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.098
{\an5}I never seen you at Pride,
I never-- I don't go
to Pride like that.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.668
{\an8}But just, though,
right before you,

30:36.734 --> 30:37.902
{\an8}a girl named
La'Britney went.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.537
{\an1}I didn't need the comparison
to another artist,

30:39.604 --> 30:41.206
{\an4}'cause that's like me saying,
like, how many followers
you got?

30:41.272 --> 30:43.408
I mean, I'm about my money
and I'm always on tour.

30:43.474 --> 30:44.842
I don't know who you are.
What was your name again?

30:44.909 --> 30:46.711
{\an1}Haven't heard of him.
Okay, so yeah.

30:46.778 --> 30:48.146
I see the shade.

30:48.213 --> 30:49.480
(Misster Ray)
I just feel like at Pride,

30:49.547 --> 30:51.349
because it's such
a festive fun,

30:51.416 --> 30:53.218
people, you know,
I feel like your fans

30:53.284 --> 30:54.953
that will come out
if you're on the flyer,

30:55.019 --> 30:57.021
they're gonna be looking for,
you know, the wig.

30:57.088 --> 30:59.724
{\an1}I choose not to limit myself
to what people want.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.993
{\an5}Right.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.993
If y'all want Kandie,

31:02.060 --> 31:03.361
{\an1}y'all don't have
to wait till Pride

31:03.428 --> 31:04.963
{\an1}to go see Kandie
at the Kandie event.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.198
{\an5}I'm not doing it as Kandie.

31:05.029 --> 31:07.198
Mm-hmm.

31:07.265 --> 31:09.467
{\an1}I don't think the budget
is there, trust me.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.936
{\an5}Well, thank you for coming.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.936
Thank you so much.

31:12.003 --> 31:14.239
(overlapping thanks)

31:14.305 --> 31:16.407
{\an1}I understand him
wanting to be JayWill

31:16.474 --> 31:19.310
{\an4}and being who he is,
and not being
defined as Kandie,

31:19.377 --> 31:21.913
{\an7}but I feel like
that performance can happen

31:21.980 --> 31:23.514
{\an8}at another location.

31:23.581 --> 31:24.749
{\an9}Right.

31:23.581 --> 31:24.749
{\an8}At another time.

31:24.816 --> 31:28.720
{\an8}Right, yeah.

31:24.816 --> 31:28.720
{\an8}That's all.

31:28.786 --> 31:31.923
{\an8}(laughter)

31:31.990 --> 31:34.926
{\an8}♪♪

31:37.595 --> 31:40.198
{\an8}(Teairra)
Sure, I got a lawyer on my team,

31:40.265 --> 31:43.701
{\an8}and she's the dragon lady
that's gonna kick Akbar's ass.

31:43.768 --> 31:46.170
But it's been pretty lonely
hiding from the public

31:46.237 --> 31:47.472
and keeping to myself.

31:47.538 --> 31:49.240
When Paris called me
this morning,

31:49.307 --> 31:52.076
I decided it's time
to face my friends.

31:52.143 --> 31:53.745
Check you out.

31:53.811 --> 31:55.146
{\an1}Hey.

31:53.811 --> 31:55.146
You're undercover.

31:55.213 --> 31:58.049
{\an1}Yeah, it's, like,
embarrassing right now.

31:58.116 --> 32:02.086
{\an7}This is the most humiliating
time in my life

32:02.153 --> 32:04.422
{\an8}that I've ever
been through.

32:02.153 --> 32:04.422
{\an9}Mm-hmm.

32:04.489 --> 32:09.060
{\an1}And for me to be speculated
to be involved in this,

32:09.127 --> 32:11.095
{\an1}it just (bleep) me up
even more.

32:11.162 --> 32:13.631
The idea that I released
this sex tape,

32:13.698 --> 32:15.400
that is just ridiculous.

32:15.466 --> 32:19.237
I did not release
this sex tape!

32:19.304 --> 32:21.673
This crime is being
turned back on me,

32:21.739 --> 32:23.708
and it's
just not (bleep) right.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.009
I'm, like, confused
right now.

32:25.076 --> 32:27.245
Like, I'm upset,
like, he leaked the video,

32:27.312 --> 32:28.546
he did all that bull(bleep).

32:28.613 --> 32:30.014
But the same day
the video came out,

32:30.081 --> 32:31.983
you did a whole
interview saying

32:32.050 --> 32:33.818
that you still in love
with this guy.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.787
{\an5}It looks crazy to me.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.787
{\an1}Okay!

32:35.853 --> 32:37.789
{\an4}Well, do you
believe me or not?

32:35.853 --> 32:37.789
It looks crazy.

32:37.855 --> 32:40.158
Believe-- what, believe you
that you're done with him?

32:40.224 --> 32:41.492
I don't believe that.

32:41.559 --> 32:43.795
{\an1}Do you believe that I put
the tape out on myself?

32:43.861 --> 32:45.396
{\an5}No, he put the tape out.

32:43.861 --> 32:45.396
{\an1}Okay.

32:45.463 --> 32:46.664
I wouldn't think you--
but I do believe

32:46.731 --> 32:48.199
you're still
in love with him.

32:48.266 --> 32:49.667
Paris, it's just dumb.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.436
{\an1}It's dumb, I was
being (bleep) dumb!

32:51.502 --> 32:53.471
What if he come back
saying something else?

32:53.538 --> 32:56.240
{\an1}He-- ain't no (bleep)
coming back, bitch!

32:56.307 --> 32:58.576
{\an5}Ain't gonna be no turn around.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.576
{\an3}I thought it wasn't
gonna be no turn back

32:58.643 --> 33:00.645
{\an5}when we found out
about the wife.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.645
I get what you saying!

33:00.712 --> 33:02.146
{\an4}I get--

33:00.712 --> 33:02.146
I thought it wasn't
gonna be no turn back

33:02.213 --> 33:03.481
with the girlfriend,
I thought it wasn't

33:03.548 --> 33:04.716
{\an5}gonna be no turn back...

33:03.548 --> 33:04.716
{\an1}All right.

33:04.782 --> 33:06.050
...when we got
into a fight.

33:06.117 --> 33:07.885
{\an1}I don't give a (bleep)
about the fake wife,

33:07.952 --> 33:10.455
the girlfriend, I don't give
a (bleep) about none of that.

33:10.521 --> 33:12.790
{\an1}All I give a (bleep) about
is this sex tape.

33:12.857 --> 33:15.093
{\an1}People are questioning
me at this point.

33:15.159 --> 33:17.929
{\an1}So, what I have to do
is go full-forward

33:17.995 --> 33:19.831
with a (bleep) lawsuit.

33:19.897 --> 33:21.733
Oh, so you gonna sue him?

33:21.799 --> 33:23.101
{\an1}(bleep) with
the wrong bitch.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.969
This is getting real.

33:25.036 --> 33:26.437
I met with the lawyer.

33:26.504 --> 33:28.806
{\an1}She wants to do
a press conference.

33:28.873 --> 33:30.375
This is serious.

33:30.441 --> 33:32.343
{\an4}I mean--

33:30.441 --> 33:32.343
Once you look--
sit with a lawyer,

33:32.410 --> 33:33.711
it's like...

33:32.410 --> 33:33.711
{\an1}It's over!

33:33.778 --> 33:36.547
{\an1}You forgive after
your friend get into fight.

33:36.614 --> 33:38.916
{\an1}You forgive after your friend
found out he got a wife.

33:38.983 --> 33:41.686
{\an5}Oh, you forgive, sis.

33:38.983 --> 33:41.686
Oh, is my friend gonna be at
the press conference, though?

33:41.753 --> 33:44.322
Tee, I'm not that friend.

33:44.389 --> 33:48.292
I'm staying all the way
out of this situation.

33:48.359 --> 33:51.129
I got love for TT,
but I don't play with the law.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.864
Me and Nikki did our
friendly digging,

33:52.930 --> 33:55.500
and after that, we see videos,
her saying she love him.

33:55.566 --> 33:57.368
Me being a super-friend
in this situation,

33:57.435 --> 33:58.870
it's just going
all type of wrong.

33:58.936 --> 34:00.805
{\an1}Speaking of,
where's Nicole?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.874
I-- I don't know
where Nikki at.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.909
{\an5}She probably--

34:02.940 --> 34:04.909
But she was there

34:04.976 --> 34:07.779
{\an1}when the gossiping
and nosiness was going on.

34:07.845 --> 34:10.214
{\an1}But where you at right now
when a bitch need you?

34:10.281 --> 34:11.916
{\an3}Right.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.684
I thought Paris and Nikki
were my friends,

34:13.751 --> 34:15.253
but when I really
needed them,

34:15.319 --> 34:17.255
one wanted to point fingers,

34:17.321 --> 34:18.322
and one just went
(bleep) ghost.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.358
That ain't friendship.

34:20.425 --> 34:23.094
{\an1}My mother(bleep) real
friends better be there

34:23.161 --> 34:24.529
for emotional support,

34:24.594 --> 34:26.130
{\an1}because it's no
turning back for me.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.864
You understand that?

34:26.197 --> 34:27.864
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

34:27.931 --> 34:29.400
Well, I'll understand it
when I see it.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.936
{\an5}You gonna mother(bleep) see.

34:29.467 --> 34:31.936
I'ma see with both eyes.

35:05.336 --> 35:07.238
{\an5}Savage-man, ooh!

35:05.336 --> 35:07.238
Ooh, savage-man.

35:07.305 --> 35:09.474
I really feel bad
for what happened

35:09.540 --> 35:11.809
at the dinner with A1,
Lyrica, and Safaree.

35:11.876 --> 35:13.177
So I really hope that A1

35:13.244 --> 35:14.846
shows up tonight
at our card game,

35:14.912 --> 35:17.048
because I really wanna tell
my bro that...

35:17.114 --> 35:19.784
everything I did
was for his benefit.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.252
Where A1 at, bro?

35:21.319 --> 35:23.387
Honestly, I don't think they
were gonna make it tonight.

35:23.454 --> 35:24.622
{\an1}You don't think A1
gonna make it tonight.

35:24.689 --> 35:26.023
A boys' nice, you know,
that's (bleep) up.

35:26.090 --> 35:27.658
You a married man
and your partner

35:27.725 --> 35:28.993
(bleep) your other
partner wife.

35:29.060 --> 35:31.729
{\an1}Fam, that's--
that's heartbreaking.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.565
Yo!

35:31.796 --> 35:34.565
Yo!

35:34.632 --> 35:36.601
Man, what the hell
is going on, man?

35:36.667 --> 35:40.037
What's up, baby?
You late, daddy-o.

35:40.104 --> 35:44.175
{\an1}Bro!
What's happening, man?

35:44.242 --> 35:46.077
Oh, oh, like that?

35:46.143 --> 35:47.778
{\an1}What the (bleep)?
What's the problem?

35:47.845 --> 35:49.347
Come on, bro.

35:49.413 --> 35:52.517
Last time I saw Ray J was
right before I blacked out

35:52.583 --> 35:55.486
after he set fire
in the room and then bounced

35:55.553 --> 35:57.955
at the friends dinner
I invited him to.

35:58.022 --> 36:00.958
So clearly, Ray is a fraud
just like his man, Safaree.

36:01.025 --> 36:02.627
And the only reason
why I'm here tonight

36:02.693 --> 36:04.328
is to get some answers.

36:04.395 --> 36:05.930
Let's get our energy
together now.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.598
{\an5}Oh, man.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.598
What's your problem, man?

36:07.665 --> 36:08.966
You know what the-- bro.

36:09.033 --> 36:10.635
{\an1}No, I need to-- I really
need to know the problem, fam,

36:10.701 --> 36:12.103
'cause I don't understand...

36:12.169 --> 36:14.138
{\an4}I don't understand
the situation.

36:12.169 --> 36:14.138
First of all,

36:14.205 --> 36:15.439
why would you do that?

36:15.506 --> 36:17.742
Like, I get what
you were trying to do,

36:17.808 --> 36:19.310
but that wasn't the time.

36:19.377 --> 36:21.379
{\an5}Exactly, exactly.

36:19.377 --> 36:21.379
{\an1}Where else would
we had it?

36:21.445 --> 36:22.980
{\an1}Like, why not try
to iron this (bleep) out

36:23.047 --> 36:25.917
{\an1}with my pregnant wife here
and everybody women,

36:25.983 --> 36:28.853
{\an1}so it kinda gives it more
of a peaceful balance.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.621
{\an5}So what'd he tell you?

36:28.920 --> 36:30.621
{\an1}(Marcus)
I heard the same thing.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.924
{\an1}The (bleep) told me
it just happened.

36:32.990 --> 36:34.158
But he's saying
it didn't.

36:34.225 --> 36:36.394
I'm, like, all right,
so who's lying?

36:36.460 --> 36:38.329
{\an5}Is you lying?

36:36.460 --> 36:38.329
{\an1}Wait, he's saying
he didn't wen--

36:38.396 --> 36:39.997
{\an5}He never said he didn't--

36:38.396 --> 36:39.997
Yeah, he did.

36:40.064 --> 36:41.666
{\an5}(Marcus)
I didn't hear him
say that.

36:41.732 --> 36:43.401
He would be like, "Ray,
I didn't say that exactly."

36:43.467 --> 36:44.802
He want to play semantics.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.804
But he wouldn't say,
"That's not what happened."

36:46.871 --> 36:48.873
Man, bro, who know
what's going on?

36:48.940 --> 36:51.042
{\an5}Right.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.042
We gotta face reality, bro.

36:51.108 --> 36:53.210
He (bleeped) her, bro.

36:53.277 --> 36:56.314
{\an4}Here's what I'm getting
upset about: Why am I
the bad guy?

36:56.380 --> 36:59.417
Like, you looking at me
all crazy and (bleep),

36:59.483 --> 37:00.818
{\an1}(bleep), I'm trying to
figure out what's happening.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.921
{\an1}You want to take your anger
out on somebody, (bleep).

37:03.988 --> 37:05.790
Like, and I'm not the one.

37:05.856 --> 37:07.391
(Ray J)
Look, A1 is my brother,

37:07.458 --> 37:09.660
so the only reason why I got
into this mess

37:09.727 --> 37:11.062
was to help him out,

37:11.128 --> 37:13.564
and now RoccStar is showing me
the text messages

37:13.631 --> 37:14.599
with him and Lyrica.

37:14.665 --> 37:16.968
A1 need to open his eyes.

37:17.034 --> 37:19.236
But to say that
I'm starting this (bleep),

37:19.303 --> 37:22.173
that's just
a tad bit disrespectful.

37:22.239 --> 37:23.975
{\an4}Ain't nothing wrong
with a brother
need fade, fam.

37:24.041 --> 37:26.911
{\an4}So...

37:24.041 --> 37:26.911
(bleep), hold up, (bleep)

37:26.978 --> 37:28.145
{\an1}Well, fir--
Wait, hold on--

37:28.212 --> 37:29.981
{\an5}How you talking (bleep)?

37:28.212 --> 37:29.981
Easy.

37:30.047 --> 37:32.550
(overlapping chatter)

37:32.617 --> 37:34.719
Ray, come on, bro,
you don't want this.

37:34.785 --> 37:37.521
{\an5}(Marcus)
Hey, listen, all this (bleep)
is some bull(bleep).

37:37.588 --> 37:39.223
Ain't no (bleep)
you can me, my (bleep).

37:39.290 --> 37:41.626
{\an5}What I--

37:39.290 --> 37:41.626
You (bleep) going
for fake (bleep).

37:41.692 --> 37:42.827
{\an8}(Solo)
Not too (bleep), though.

37:42.893 --> 37:45.296
{\an8}If definitely
ain't (bleep).

37:45.363 --> 37:47.431
Here's the reality,
my (bleep), like--

37:47.498 --> 37:49.900
{\an5}Nah, ain't no (bleep)
you can say to me
right now, mother(bleep).

37:49.967 --> 37:52.570
{\an4}Ain't (bleep)
I can say to you?
It ain't-- Listen, fam--

37:52.637 --> 37:54.905
Let's catch
a brother fade, (bleep).

37:54.972 --> 37:56.340
Hold on!

37:56.407 --> 37:59.043
{\an1}Listen, like I said,
(bleep) call for combat, fam.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.479
{\an4}Man, I'm not no
mother(bleep) referee!

37:59.110 --> 38:01.479
Well, then get down then!

38:01.545 --> 38:04.615
{\an4}You know what time it is?
It's a one-on-one
combat, my (bleep).

38:04.682 --> 38:08.085
{\an5}Why you holding me, bro?

38:04.682 --> 38:08.085
{\an1}Like, security, all y'all
need to stand back.

38:08.152 --> 38:10.187
but we still gotta deal
with the reality.

38:10.254 --> 38:12.289
{\an1}The reality, fam,
is listen.

38:12.356 --> 38:13.624
Everybody saying
everything, fam.

38:13.691 --> 38:15.793
{\an1}They just ain't
saying it to you.

38:15.860 --> 38:17.962
{\an1}Like, you need to
holler at RoccStar.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.730
{\an5}(Ray J)
Yeah, I dropped
RoccStar's name,

38:19.797 --> 38:21.832
but A1 gotta know
that we in it now.

38:21.899 --> 38:24.001
Ain't no reason to start
pulling punches.

38:24.068 --> 38:27.138
{\an5}What they saying?

38:24.068 --> 38:27.138
{\an1}They saying they (bleep)
your girl, fam.

38:27.204 --> 38:29.240
Man, if you think
RoccStar (bleep)--

38:29.306 --> 38:32.109
Bro, there's a lot
of (bleep) going on, man.

38:32.176 --> 38:33.844
I (bleep) hate to see you
like that, bro.

38:33.911 --> 38:35.146
I don't wanna
see you like that, (bleep).

38:35.212 --> 38:36.981
Look at me like I'm lying

38:37.048 --> 38:38.749
{\an1}or trying to
spark up (bleep).

38:38.816 --> 38:41.719
{\an4}Why would I even
have the time to do
some (bleep) like that?

38:41.786 --> 38:44.522
Fam, I'm gonna say this.
Not only are you not lying,

38:44.588 --> 38:46.957
I heard
the same thing also.

38:47.024 --> 38:48.559
I know it's not easy
to hear that your girl's

38:48.626 --> 38:49.927
been out here
being unfaithful.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.696
I mean, Brooke is
Lyrica's friend also,

38:51.762 --> 38:53.531
and she don't have no reason
to be out here lying.

38:53.597 --> 38:56.067
A1 just gonna have to man up
and accept this.

38:56.133 --> 38:57.935
{\an1}You (bleep) with
the wrong person, homie.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.870
And here's the thing,
and here's the thing.

38:59.937 --> 39:01.906
{\an1}You lookin' at me
hella crazy, my (bleep),

39:01.972 --> 39:03.607
{\an1}and I feel
uncomfortable, fam.

39:03.674 --> 39:06.110
{\an1}What's up, my (bleep)?
(bleep), you know?

39:06.177 --> 39:08.879
{\an5}I don't know--

39:06.177 --> 39:08.879
You see they holding me,
my (bleep).

39:08.946 --> 39:10.715
{\an5}Yeah, they holding you.

39:08.946 --> 39:10.715
'Cause they already know.

39:10.781 --> 39:12.450
{\an1}Because they trying to
look out for you, my (bleep).

39:12.516 --> 39:15.086
{\an6}All right.

39:12.516 --> 39:15.086
{\an1}You up in here looking
real psychotic, my (bleep).

39:15.152 --> 39:16.253
{\an3}All right.

39:15.152 --> 39:16.253
{\an1}For real.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.189
You looking real psychotic,

39:18.255 --> 39:19.924
{\an1}and I don't like
that (bleep), my (bleep).

39:19.990 --> 39:21.959
{\an5}(A1)
Ray J say he's
trying to help,

39:22.026 --> 39:24.428
but I've already cleaned up
the mess with Lyrica,

39:24.495 --> 39:27.364
and now he's dragging us
back through the mud again,

39:27.431 --> 39:29.100
I thought these guys
was my boys,

39:29.166 --> 39:31.836
but I'm realizing
nobody got my back.

39:31.902 --> 39:33.604
Somebody get my (bleep).
I'm out.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.940
I definitely want
all my poker money, though.

39:36.006 --> 39:37.942
{\an1}Fam, I'm gonna let you
go get some rest.

39:38.008 --> 39:40.111
I'm gonna give you
a pass, my (bleep).

39:40.177 --> 39:41.512
It's all good.

39:41.579 --> 39:42.980
{\an1}You just not in
your right mind, fam.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.616
{\an5}That's all it is.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.616
Man, (bleep) out.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.957
{\an8}(woman)
Next time on
"Love &amp; Hip-Hop Hollywood"...

39:53.023 --> 39:56.727
{\an7}I see something in you.
I want to make some money
with you.

39:56.794 --> 40:00.631
{\an7}Well, you see like a person,
you know, can guide me.

40:00.698 --> 40:02.199
{\an7}(Lisa)
Hi, I'm attorney Lisa Bloom,

40:02.266 --> 40:03.567
{\an7}and, Teairra,
whenever you're ready.

40:03.634 --> 40:05.870
{\an8}I stand here
in the pursuit of justice.

40:05.936 --> 40:08.973
{\an8}Not just for myself,
but for any other woman

40:09.039 --> 40:10.674
{\an8}who has been exploited
by a man,

40:10.741 --> 40:14.011
{\an8}and that my rights as a woman
under the revenge porn laws

40:14.078 --> 40:15.312
{\an8}be protected.

40:15.379 --> 40:18.349
{\an7}This right here,
I hope and pray she's done.

40:18.415 --> 40:19.884
{\an8}And I just don't wanna be
wrapped up in a lawsuit

40:19.950 --> 40:21.118
{\an8}that has nothing
to do with me.

40:21.185 --> 40:24.455
{\an7}Teairra pissed off,
so be ready.

40:24.522 --> 40:25.923
{\an8}<i>I have to just</i>
<i>stand up for myself,</i>

40:25.990 --> 40:27.925
{\an8}<i>or it looks like</i>
<i>I did it.</i>

40:27.992 --> 40:30.928
{\an7}Some things don't
really add up.

40:27.992 --> 40:30.928
{\an5}Add up.

40:30.995 --> 40:33.297
{\an7}But it make me
even more nosey.

40:33.364 --> 40:35.800
{\an7}(Teairra)
So where were you
the other day, honey?

40:35.866 --> 40:37.601
{\an7}You know how selfish
you sound right now, Teairra?

40:37.668 --> 40:39.703
{\an8}Wait, so you upset
'cause she didn't come?

40:39.770 --> 40:41.205
{\an8}Or call or say (bleep).

40:41.272 --> 40:44.642
{\an8}You know how delusional
this sound?

40:44.708 --> 40:46.811
{\an8}(La'Britney)
I haven't seen you
since the audition.

40:46.877 --> 40:48.579
{\an8}How did it go?

40:48.646 --> 40:49.747
{\an7}They tried to
compare me to you,

40:49.814 --> 40:51.515
{\an8}and I'm sitting
up there like,

40:51.582 --> 40:52.883
{\an8}"Please don't compare her
where she can't compete."

40:52.950 --> 40:54.318
{\an8}This bitch is
booked and paid

40:54.385 --> 40:56.287
{\an8}while you're not booked
and mother(bleep) poor.

40:56.353 --> 40:58.122
{\an8}A1 gonna be with you?

40:56.353 --> 40:58.122
{\an8}Who told you that?

40:58.189 --> 40:59.323
{\an7}Moniece.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.323
{\an9}Huh, bitch?

40:59.390 --> 41:00.391
{\an8}Don't (bleep) your mouth!

41:00.457 --> 41:02.259
{\an7}Lord, give this (bleep)
forgiveness!

41:02.326 --> 41:04.361
{\an8}Ooh hoo hoo hoo!

41:04.428 --> 41:07.498
{\an8}How you work
with Amber Diamond
before you work with me?

41:07.565 --> 41:08.999
{\an8}It's about that time.

41:07.565 --> 41:08.999
{\an8}Let's wise up and do a record.

41:09.066 --> 41:10.434
{\an8}How about that?

41:10.501 --> 41:14.171
{\an8}What the (bleep)?
(gasping)

41:14.238 --> 41:16.106
{\an7}It's a panic attack
for sure.

41:16.173 --> 41:18.475
{\an8}(sobbing)
This is so crazy!

41:18.542 --> 41:20.277
{\an8}(siren whooping)
