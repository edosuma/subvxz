00:52.536 --> 00:54.053
<i> I've never seen teenagers</i>

00:56.632 --> 00:57.948

00:58.117 --> 00:59.466
<i> They smelled</i>

00:59.635 --> 01:01.118
<i> like that spray-on hair dye</i>
<i> I thought people</i>

01:02.638 --> 01:04.045

01:04.065 --> 01:05.822
<i> I hope I wasn't too obvious.</i>

01:07.126 --> 01:08.308

01:08.402 --> 01:09.684
<i> But with my heart?</i>

01:09.737 --> 01:11.403

01:18.728 --> 01:19.970
Oh, crap. My pen's dying.

01:20.063 --> 01:21.805
Sorry, Journal,
this might hurt a little bit.

01:21.807 --> 01:23.231
<i> I need to figure out</i>

01:23.250 --> 01:27.086

01:28.814 --> 01:30.480
Hmm. So, there's me.

01:30.499 --> 01:32.608
LINDA:
Kids! Breakfast is ready.

01:32.610 --> 01:33.984
Okay. I got to go.

01:34.077 --> 01:36.153
Hey. We said the same thing.
Jinx.

01:36.246 --> 01:37.821
Morning, my Tina.

01:37.990 --> 01:39.264
-Morning.
-Morning, my Louise.

01:39.491 --> 01:41.658
-You sleep okay?
-No, Mother. I did not.

01:41.751 --> 01:44.269
-I was tossing and turning
all night.
-Oh, no.

01:44.496 --> 01:46.555
And then, early this morning,
it struck me.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.998
It was an odor.

01:48.016 --> 01:49.757
Like if a dumpster
just got back from the gym.

01:49.835 --> 01:52.945
I searched my room, frantic,
and there they were,

01:53.096 --> 01:54.947
under my desk: Gene's stinky,

01:55.174 --> 01:57.599
nasty, abominable socks.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.618
-Oh, God. Not at breakfast!
-Ugh.
-(Tina retches)

01:59.769 --> 02:00.619
Mm-hmm. Gene, take them.

02:00.770 --> 02:03.104
Thank you.
Oh, they're still moist.

02:03.273 --> 02:05.031
He took them off yesterday
when we were playing

02:05.200 --> 02:06.774
<i> -No Floor Parkour.</i>
<i>-GENE: I needed the grippy-ness</i>

02:06.869 --> 02:08.610
<i> of my sweet, clammy feet.</i>

02:08.704 --> 02:11.779
<i> LOUISE: And I said, "Get those</i>
<i> satanic socks out of my room."</i>

02:11.799 --> 02:13.039
<i> And he said, "I will,</i>

02:13.134 --> 02:14.691
<i> right after</i>
<i> I parkour some more."</i>

02:14.710 --> 02:15.968
<i> But then he forgot.</i>

02:16.119 --> 02:17.136
-That sounds right.
-BOB: Ugh.

02:17.287 --> 02:18.211
Louise, why didn't you

02:18.364 --> 02:19.471
just throw them in the hamper?

02:19.623 --> 02:20.788
Or in the garbage?

02:20.808 --> 02:23.425
Because, Father,
I wanted him to feel shame.

02:23.535 --> 02:25.310
I think they smell fun
and interesting.

02:25.462 --> 02:27.737
Oh, really?
So you feel no shame?

02:27.797 --> 02:29.148
The opposite. I feel pride.

02:29.375 --> 02:30.724
I could smell these socks
all day.

02:30.876 --> 02:32.709
Fine, then do it.
Wear them again.

02:32.728 --> 02:33.894
That sounds like a bad idea.

02:33.970 --> 02:35.470
-Okay.
-Gene.
-Oh, no, no, no.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.805
Not on your feet.
That's too far from your nose.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.307
Well, I can't wear them
on my hands.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.568
What if someone asks me
to do a spontaneous piano solo?

02:41.662 --> 02:45.055
Wear them in... this area.
Near the smell zone.

02:45.073 --> 02:48.500
Or your dad had that fun idea
to throw them in the hamper.

02:48.652 --> 02:49.817
How about right here?

02:49.912 --> 02:51.653
I could use
some necktie accessorizing.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.338
I'm dressing for sock-cess.

02:53.490 --> 02:54.506
Gene, please don't.

02:54.658 --> 02:56.233
Father, this is something
I have to do.

02:56.251 --> 02:57.509
-Is it?
-Yes.
-Yes.

02:57.661 --> 02:59.845
I'm gonna go wash my hands
for a very long time.

02:59.996 --> 03:01.013
You won't last a day!

03:01.256 --> 03:03.515
Oh, yes, I will.
And I'll look great doing it.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.743
Papa? Would you help me tie my
sweaty sock into a Windsor knot?

03:06.762 --> 03:10.338
I don't know how to do that,
and I don't want to touch it.

03:10.507 --> 03:13.250
-Fair enough.
-Earth to Teeny Tina.

03:13.343 --> 03:14.693
-Have some breakfast.
-Oh.

03:14.844 --> 03:16.102
I was just thinking
about those kids

03:16.255 --> 03:18.012
that have been coming into
the restaurant lately.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.514
You mean me, you and Louise?

03:19.533 --> 03:23.869
No, the ones with the hair
and the clothes and the swagger.

03:24.096 --> 03:25.612
-Talking about me?
-BOB/LINDA: The teens.

03:25.764 --> 03:27.431
Ugh, again with the teens.

03:27.449 --> 03:29.208
If you want swagger,
check this out.

03:29.359 --> 03:31.359
(grunting rhythmically)

03:31.453 --> 03:33.545
(sighs) I think something
dripped onto your plate

03:33.772 --> 03:35.697
-from those things.
-Oh, look at that.

03:36.625 --> 03:40.777
Tina, honey, your face might be
smudging the glass a little bit.

03:40.870 --> 03:43.204
Maybe if you mop a little worse,
they'll come sooner?

03:43.298 --> 03:46.800
-You could also mop
anywhere else?
-No, thank you.

03:46.952 --> 03:49.043
Okay, Gene.
You've made your point.

03:49.121 --> 03:50.395
You can take the tie off now.

03:50.622 --> 03:51.972
Mm-mm. Today was great
because of this tie.

03:52.066 --> 03:54.733
I turned a lot of heads. And
I cleared the cafeteria line.

03:54.884 --> 03:57.402
All I had to do was jiggle
it about. My tie, that is.

03:57.554 --> 04:00.630
Nuh-uh. There's no way
that wearing that smelly sock

04:00.724 --> 04:02.390
as a necktie was a good thing.

04:02.484 --> 04:03.633
It's fine, Louise.
You wouldn't get it.

04:03.652 --> 04:05.485
You're living that
no-sock-necktie life.

04:05.637 --> 04:07.804
Probably 'cause you're not
strong enough. And that's okay.

04:07.897 --> 04:11.308
Oh, I'm strong enough. I'm just
not quite as dumb as you.

04:11.401 --> 04:14.402
But if I chose to wear a sock
necktie, I'd be great at it.

04:14.496 --> 04:15.921
I'd be better at it than you.

04:16.148 --> 04:18.331
Your mouth is writing checks
your nose can't cash.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.650
(scoffs) My nose
can write checks all day.

04:20.819 --> 04:22.094
It's got overdraft protection.

04:22.212 --> 04:24.429
Well, mine reimburses you
for out-of-network ATM fees!

04:24.598 --> 04:26.656
They're here! Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

04:26.675 --> 04:28.341
Here.
Give me the mop so you can...

04:28.494 --> 04:29.751
This mop is dry.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.270
There's nothing even
in the bucket.

04:31.421 --> 04:33.772
-Sorry, yeah.
It was just my cover.
-Okay.

04:33.923 --> 04:35.665
Well, go give them their menus.

04:35.759 --> 04:38.351
-Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh.
-Or maybe I'll do the menus.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.595
-Huh. Huh.
-Tina, when you take
their order, you should scream,

04:40.672 --> 04:43.023
"Love me!" right in their faces.
People like that.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.025
I can't take their order.
They're them.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.434
And I'm just regular.

04:46.512 --> 04:48.194
No, you're not.
You're irregular.

04:48.347 --> 04:49.437
Like Dad's heartbeat.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.698
It's not irregular.
It's just funky.

04:51.850 --> 04:53.683
You can do it, Tina.
You're a waitress.

04:53.777 --> 04:55.276
Sort of. So, just wait on them?

04:55.296 --> 04:57.945
-You want me to take
their order, honey?
-No.

04:57.965 --> 05:02.042
-I'll do it. (groaning)
-Attagirl.

05:02.194 --> 05:03.468
So far, so good.

05:03.620 --> 05:06.305
(groaning continues)

05:06.532 --> 05:07.639
Hey.

05:07.791 --> 05:11.885
Hi, I'm Tina?
Can I take your order? (choking)

05:11.961 --> 05:13.870
Sorry. (gagging)

05:13.889 --> 05:16.130
I'm just ch--
I'm choking on my spit.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.542
(coughs) You can start ordering.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.710
I can write and choke.

05:20.729 --> 05:21.820
She's doing great.

05:21.971 --> 05:23.380
Maybe she wanted it
to be like this?

05:23.398 --> 05:24.898
You know,
where she gags on them?

05:24.992 --> 05:27.884
Maybe it sounds worse
from here, somehow?

05:27.977 --> 05:29.235
Okay, got it.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.238
Um, I'll just get this
into the, um, the-the kitchen?

05:32.391 --> 05:34.574
So that they can
make food for you.

05:34.726 --> 05:36.651
Um, and that's how it's
done here. (chuckles nervously)

05:36.670 --> 05:39.320
Thanks. So what time should we
get to the Odeon next Saturday?

05:39.340 --> 05:40.839
-O-Ow.
-Well, the Mud Stains go on

05:40.990 --> 05:44.751
at 8:00. And I want to
be doing this by 8:05.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.328
-So, 7:00?
<i> -TINA: The Mud Stains</i>
<i> at the Odeon?</i>

05:47.422 --> 05:49.756
<i> Must be a band they like.</i>
<i> Writing it down.</i>

05:49.833 --> 05:52.742
<i>I'm gonna stand here and listen</i>
<i> a little while longer.</i>

05:52.761 --> 05:56.746
<i> Look casual. (strains)</i>
<i> That's it. Good job.</i>

05:56.765 --> 05:59.099
<i> Keeping it casual.</i>

05:59.251 --> 06:00.842
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

06:00.919 --> 06:02.861
"The Mud Stains," question mark.

06:03.012 --> 06:05.589
"Cool band," question mark.
Question mark.

06:05.682 --> 06:07.424
Sorry, that's for me.
Um, here you go.

06:07.442 --> 06:09.776
This one says, "Don't fart,
don't fart, don't fart."

06:09.870 --> 06:11.536
Tina, did you even
take their order?

06:11.688 --> 06:12.854
Sorry. Let me find it.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.373
Um, here you--
No. Nope. Not that one.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.209
Um, how about-- nope.
No. Um, oh! Okay, here it is.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.269
Lot of exclamation points.

06:19.271 --> 06:21.046
Yeah, it was
a really good order.

06:21.197 --> 06:22.606
I'll-I'll need it back later.

06:23.366 --> 06:26.551
Ah, look who went to the hamper
and found exciting neckwear,

06:26.778 --> 06:28.202
who can totally handle it,

06:28.296 --> 06:30.389
because she's stronger than
anyone else in this family.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.557
Oh, no.
You're both doing this now?

06:32.709 --> 06:34.134
Ooh, one of my socks from today.

06:34.286 --> 06:36.561
Fresh off my feet.
It will be especially pungent.

06:36.638 --> 06:38.805
We had P.E.,
and I stepped in a puddle.

06:38.882 --> 06:40.306
-Mm.
-Yeah, I'm getting that.

06:40.459 --> 06:43.627
All right. Family togetherness
time with the TV.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.462
Oh, Louise. Oh, no, honey.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.406
-Oh, yes.
-Hey, where's Tina?

06:47.633 --> 06:48.723
Tina! TV!

06:48.742 --> 06:49.983
TINA:
I'm gonna stay in my room.

06:50.152 --> 06:51.134
You guys can watch TV
without me.

06:51.227 --> 06:53.803
Nerd! Just kidding. Sorta.

06:53.822 --> 06:55.747
<i> TINA:</i>
<i> Journal, I have a plan.</i>

06:55.899 --> 06:57.416
<i> The teens, they're the key.</i>

06:57.567 --> 06:59.643
<i> The key to a better me,</i>
<i> a better life.</i>

06:59.736 --> 07:01.253
<i> The next time they come</i>

07:01.404 --> 07:02.996

07:17.604 --> 07:19.512
-(punk rock music playing)
-Okay, okay.

07:19.665 --> 07:20.939
That's a little shouty.

07:21.090 --> 07:22.774
Ah, I-I love it.

07:22.926 --> 07:26.169
Just gonna turn it down a little
bit. Because I love it so much.

07:26.262 --> 07:28.262
Yay. The plan's already working.

07:28.356 --> 07:31.616
This is the new me. Just gonna
turn it down a little bit more.

07:35.013 --> 07:36.288
Okay, we're off
to the thrift store

07:36.439 --> 07:38.290
to get Tina a funky old outfit.

07:38.441 --> 07:39.365
Yep, step two of

07:39.518 --> 07:41.460
my "Tina Becomes
A Cool Teen-a" plan.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.703
Step one was a huge success,
and I totally love

07:43.855 --> 07:46.189
how scary and angry
all the Mud Stains songs are.

-Such a good song.
-Yeah.

07:59.128 --> 08:01.646
Oh, and, Dad, if the teens
come in before I get back,

08:01.798 --> 08:02.981
text Mom and try to stall them.

08:03.132 --> 08:05.375
-Uh...
-Just talk to them about emojis

08:05.393 --> 08:07.043
and new drugs
you've heard about.

08:07.136 --> 08:08.712
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Have fun shopping

08:08.805 --> 08:10.021
while we stay at work.

08:10.173 --> 08:11.564
-Not bothered by this at all.
-Good luck.

08:11.717 --> 08:13.399
Don't pierce anything
I wouldn't pierce!

08:13.552 --> 08:15.160
Have I told you all the things
I wouldn't pierce?

08:15.311 --> 08:16.903
Basically,
everything but my ween.

08:19.407 --> 08:21.333
Maybe they have, like,
a badass teen section?

08:21.484 --> 08:23.168
Probably not.
I'm trying to remember

08:23.395 --> 08:24.577
what those kids were wearing.

08:24.730 --> 08:26.654
I just remember I wanted
to brush all their hair.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.249

-Hey, Teddy.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.029
Still wearing socks
as a necktie, huh?

08:51.180 --> 08:52.364
Double sock necktie.

08:52.515 --> 08:54.591
Yeah, it's double the struggle.
For Gene.

08:54.684 --> 08:56.183
I don't really get it.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.536
I guess it's different
for every generation.

08:57.687 --> 08:59.763
With mine, it was talking back
to authority figures.

08:59.856 --> 09:01.948
With yours, it's dirty socks
around your neck.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.283
Yeah, they get like this.

09:03.435 --> 09:05.210
Were you here
when they decided to see

09:05.361 --> 09:07.028
who could hold their pee
the longest?

09:07.105 --> 09:08.104
Th-That didn't end well.

09:08.106 --> 09:09.047
Oh, yeah, that was bad.

09:09.198 --> 09:10.715
Kids, go take out the garbage.

09:10.867 --> 09:12.700
Uh, take your time.
Or, you know,

09:12.719 --> 09:14.944
stop wearing nasty,
dirty clothes around your neck.

09:14.963 --> 09:16.871
Louise can stop
any time she wants.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.465
-I'll stop after you stop.
-I'll stop after you stop.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.208
Well, I guess you're never
stopping, 'cause I love it.

09:21.303 --> 09:24.712
Not as much as I love it.
This is my spiritual practice.

09:24.790 --> 09:25.972
I'm teaching a class on this,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.049
and it's already full
for the next ten years.

09:28.143 --> 09:29.475
Do you need a guest speaker?

09:29.628 --> 09:31.311
-We're doing our best.
-(doorbell jingles)

09:31.463 --> 09:32.962
We're back, and we got slacks!

09:33.056 --> 09:34.221
-Ah, ah, ah.
-And some other stuff, too.

09:34.316 --> 09:35.389
-Did they come in?
-No.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.224
-Phew.
-Wow, look at those boots.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.484
TEDDY:
Whoa. Combat boots.

09:38.637 --> 09:40.745
Are you storming
the beaches of Normandy later?

09:40.972 --> 09:41.971
Just kidding. I know you're not.

09:42.065 --> 09:43.248
Are those your size?

09:43.399 --> 09:45.417
They're someone's size.
Ah! Oops.

09:45.644 --> 09:48.086
I'm gonna run upstairs and
change and then come back down.

09:48.237 --> 09:49.646
If they come while I'm gone,
just, uh,

09:49.664 --> 09:51.072
take a really long time
to make their food.

09:51.166 --> 09:53.483
Feels like that's happening
right now for me.

(sighs) Forget it.

10:34.617 --> 10:37.093
They're gone.
Out of my life forever.

10:38.454 --> 10:39.638
The concert!

10:39.865 --> 10:42.031
I have to go to the
Mud Stains concert at the Odeon!

10:42.125 --> 10:43.141
Tonight. Right now!

10:43.292 --> 10:44.550
Um, okay, what's happening?

10:44.645 --> 10:47.053
The confi-cool teens.
They didn't come back,

10:47.147 --> 10:48.388
and they may never come back,

10:48.464 --> 10:50.223
and it's the one place
I know they're gonna be.

10:50.375 --> 10:51.799
At the Odeon. Tonight.

10:51.893 --> 10:53.801
I got to go there. Or-or they'll
slip through my fingers forever.

10:53.895 --> 10:55.211
-LOUISE: Like Dad's hair.
-Louise.

10:55.230 --> 10:56.546
Can I go? Please?

10:56.564 --> 10:57.897
It's all ages,

10:58.049 --> 10:59.382
which I think means
babies will be there?

10:59.475 --> 11:00.808
A-And it's happening right now!

11:00.902 --> 11:03.403
And-and I'll spend my own money,
but it's 3.2 miles away,

11:03.555 --> 11:05.738
so I need a ride! Please?
I'll clean the whole house!

11:05.891 --> 11:07.165
-I-I'll do laundry!
-No need.

11:07.392 --> 11:11.819
Uh, yeah, sure, okay.
Uh, right, Bob?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.004
Uh, yeah.

11:13.231 --> 11:14.172
Maybe I'll go with you.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.065
Yay! My first hard rock concert.

11:16.084 --> 11:19.085
I want to stage dive.
Ooh, no, stage cannonball.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.753
Um, it could go pretty late.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.405
I mean,
it's already kind of late.

11:22.424 --> 11:23.848
Maybe just your mom
and Tina should go.

11:24.075 --> 11:25.666
But we'll drop
you guys off and...

11:25.760 --> 11:27.427
Get gelato from that place.

11:27.579 --> 11:29.521
Ooh, gelato.
I'd rather stage dive that.

11:29.672 --> 11:32.432
Uh, okay. That's kind of close
to the Odeon.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.267
Okay, great.
Mom, you gonna wear that?

11:34.343 --> 11:35.935
I mean, it's-it's fine.
It's fine!

11:36.029 --> 11:38.087
LINDA:
Okay, we're here.

11:38.106 --> 11:40.256
-Bye.
-We'll see you crazy kids
in a little bit,

11:40.349 --> 11:41.682
unless we get moshed to death.

11:41.851 --> 11:43.109
Just kidding. Oh, God.
It's fine.

11:43.261 --> 11:44.277
Bye, Tina. Oh, look!

11:44.371 --> 11:46.279
Sock tie is waving to you, too.

11:46.431 --> 11:48.448
Goodbye. Pshew, pshew, pshew!

11:48.542 --> 11:51.100
Oh, so is mine.
Wafty, wafty, wafty.

11:51.235 --> 11:52.785
-Pshew, pshew, pshew!
-Wafty, wafty, wafty!

11:52.938 --> 11:54.713
-Pshew, pshew, pshew, pshew...
-Wafty, wafty, wafty, wafty...

11:54.864 --> 11:56.214
Wait, Lin, now I want to switch.

11:56.365 --> 11:57.698
-LINDA: Too late. Goodbye.
-BOB: Hmm.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.719
Hi, um, two tickets
to the Mud Stains, please.

12:00.870 --> 12:02.703
One cool young adult and one...

12:02.723 --> 12:04.113
Mom, are you a senior yet?

12:04.282 --> 12:05.539
No. Thank you, Tina.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.616
Sorry, it's sold out.

12:06.634 --> 12:07.875
What? Sold out?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.210
No! How?

12:09.229 --> 12:10.470
I mean, you're a little late.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.397
They started playing
like a half an hour ago.

12:12.474 --> 12:14.123
And the opening band
even went long:

12:14.217 --> 12:15.508
-Your Mom's a Fart.
-Hey.

12:15.660 --> 12:17.627
-Uh, that's the name
of the opening band.
-Oh.

12:17.645 --> 12:19.070
But, also, concerts

12:19.297 --> 12:20.721
-sell out sometimes.
-Oh.

12:20.815 --> 12:24.075
Oh, no. Hey, uh, wh-what if,
uh, th-there's an extra

12:24.227 --> 12:26.244
four dollars in it for you?

12:26.395 --> 12:29.138
And, uh, some mints?
And a maxi pad?

12:29.232 --> 12:30.564
Nah. I can get free ones here.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.626
-No! No, no, no, no, no!
-LINDA: It's-it's got wings!

12:38.166 --> 12:39.832
I don't care what anybody says.
Gelato is good.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.076
I would fight someone
that said gelato wasn't good.

12:42.245 --> 12:45.338
I would, at the very least,
shake my head and go "mm-mm-mm."

12:45.432 --> 12:47.840
BOB:
Okay, well, now that
we've given you a ton of sugar,

12:48.009 --> 12:51.752
let's get you to bed. Tina,
did the gelato help you at all?

12:51.772 --> 12:52.937
(sighs)

12:53.164 --> 12:54.272
Tina said I should eat hers.

12:54.349 --> 12:55.923
She said it would
make her feel better.

12:56.017 --> 12:57.517
I think she wanted us
to split it.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.926
Is it full of tears?

12:58.945 --> 13:01.671
It is tear infused, I think.
Sorry, Tina.

13:01.689 --> 13:04.173
-Ah! It's them! It's them!
-LINDA: Oh, my God!

13:04.192 --> 13:05.675
-Oh, my God.
-The concert must be over.

13:05.768 --> 13:08.011
-Dad, follow those teens.
-LINDA: Follow those teens, Bob!

13:08.029 --> 13:10.455
Okay, but the light
is still red.

13:10.682 --> 13:12.940
I'm riding a gelato high.
I'm up for anything.

13:13.034 --> 13:16.702
Yeah. And I'm so jacked up on
sock smell, I feel invincible.

13:16.797 --> 13:17.778
Green light, Dad. Go!

13:17.798 --> 13:18.963
GENE:
Go, go, go, Dad.

13:19.115 --> 13:20.298
TINA:
But can you follow them better?

13:20.449 --> 13:21.357
LINDA:
Yeah. Come on, Bob.

13:21.376 --> 13:22.542
BOB:
Okay, I'm trying.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.618
It's hard to follow people
who are walking

13:24.638 --> 13:26.787
-when you're in a car.
-There. They went in there.

13:26.881 --> 13:29.456
-Park, Dad, park.
-Park, Bob!
-Why aren't you parking?

13:29.551 --> 13:31.142
BOB:
It's a lot of different
driving instructions.

13:31.369 --> 13:32.977
-LOUISE: Are we parked yet?
-TINA: I love you, Dad,

13:33.204 --> 13:34.795
-but what are you doing?
-BOB: Hold on, hold on.

13:34.964 --> 13:36.372
I-I-I'm-- (sighs)
I angled wrong.

13:36.465 --> 13:39.150
I nosed in,
but I can, I can save it.

13:39.227 --> 13:41.653
Let me just back up a tiny bit,
and then pull in some more.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.046
Bob, why didn't you
just back in?

13:43.064 --> 13:44.881
I know! I know!
I thought I had room.

13:44.974 --> 13:46.899
-I can make this work!
-Dad, come on!

13:46.993 --> 13:48.159
The teens grew up already.

13:48.386 --> 13:50.053
Okay, it's very easy
to judge the parker

13:50.071 --> 13:51.329
when you're not the one parking.

13:51.556 --> 13:53.647
-Here we go. Kind of.
-Okay, Dad, Dad, Dad!

13:53.741 --> 13:56.334
There. We're parked.
Let's talk about something else.

13:56.561 --> 13:58.485
Okay, I'm going in.
Wait. What's my plan?

13:58.505 --> 14:00.396
Um, what if I, like,
sit near them

14:00.489 --> 14:02.156
and casually sing
a Mud Stains song?

14:02.175 --> 14:03.490
And they'll hear me,
and they'll be like,

14:03.568 --> 14:05.068
"Hey, we just
went to their concert."

14:05.236 --> 14:07.011
And I'll be like, "Yeah,
I-I went to that concert, too.

14:07.163 --> 14:09.255
I mean, basically. I wa--
I was right outside of it."

14:09.407 --> 14:11.090
And then we'll talk all night
about how similar we all are.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.001
But not all night.
Maybe just for a few minutes?

14:14.095 --> 14:15.261
No, all night seems fine.

14:15.338 --> 14:16.855
We don't want to waste
this parking spot.

14:17.006 --> 14:18.523
Oh, my God. What if we
exchange phone numbers?

14:18.750 --> 14:20.583
I need a phone!
All cool kids have phones.

14:20.676 --> 14:22.768
There are plenty of cool people
who don't have phones.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.270
Not right now
with that speech, Mom!

14:24.364 --> 14:26.531
-O-Okay, okay.
-Uh, here. Tina, take mine.

14:26.758 --> 14:27.848
Thank you, Dad.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.075
Text me the menu.

14:29.944 --> 14:32.095
-Whoa.
-Sit anywhere you like.

14:32.113 --> 14:33.905
Okay, I'm just gonna sit here
for a sec.

14:34.057 --> 14:35.689
And then maybe
I'll move over there.

14:35.709 --> 14:39.193
Great. I love when customers
move around. Something to drink?

14:39.287 --> 14:41.604
Oh. Um, no. Yes. Coffee.

14:41.606 --> 14:44.273
Like, uh, those kids

Do you think Tina
needs a sock necktie?

17:33.795 --> 17:36.128
She's probably feeling left out.
Should we go to the hamper?

17:36.281 --> 17:39.615

want to wear mine anymore.

17:40.952 --> 17:43.561

17:46.382 --> 17:48.733

17:48.884 --> 17:50.810
Yes. Sorry, but yes to that.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.219
Well, if we're quitting
at the same time,

17:52.313 --> 17:53.720

17:53.815 --> 17:55.389

strong, powerful women?

17:55.558 --> 17:56.557
Yeah. Way to go.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.650
Yeah, congrats, congrats.

-Oh, thank God!
-Yes, finally!

17:58.820 --> 17:59.911
What creams do we have?

18:00.138 --> 18:01.971
Anything in
the anti-fungal family?

18:02.064 --> 18:02.914
Quite a few, I think.

18:03.065 --> 18:04.323
Knock, knock.

18:04.475 --> 18:05.899
I don't want to talk about it.

18:05.919 --> 18:06.976

18:07.145 --> 18:08.586
-Yes.
-Okay.

18:08.737 --> 18:10.479

in boots like that!

18:10.573 --> 18:12.090

why they like that band!

18:12.317 --> 18:13.499
I-I don't know
how to be like them.

18:13.651 --> 18:16.152
It's just, I know
I'm never gonna be confi-cool.

18:16.170 --> 18:18.654
Tina, you are confi-cool!

18:18.673 --> 18:20.656
No, I'm not. I'm just me.

18:20.749 --> 18:22.992
But, honey, that's the secret
to being cool.

18:23.085 --> 18:25.085
Being who you are,
doing your own thing.

18:25.163 --> 18:27.772
But I don't want to be who I am.
I want to be them!

18:27.923 --> 18:28.940
I know, sweetie.

18:29.167 --> 18:31.000
I remember that feeling,
when I was your age.

18:31.002 --> 18:33.169
I just wish you could see
what I see.

18:33.262 --> 18:35.838
Then you'd know how great and
cool and interesting you are.

18:35.857 --> 18:38.282
That's the stuff you have to say
because you're my mom.

18:38.434 --> 18:41.285
No, that's what I know
from being a teenager.

18:41.512 --> 18:43.770
Come on, you think I never tried
to change who I was

18:43.790 --> 18:45.514
to make the cool kids like me?

18:45.533 --> 18:47.566
But trying to make people
think you're cool is exhausting.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.035
And when you stop trying,
suddenly the next person

18:50.130 --> 18:52.329
you talk to thinks
you're the best person ever.

18:52.482 --> 18:54.948
Thanks, Mom.
Thanks for trying to help.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.468
