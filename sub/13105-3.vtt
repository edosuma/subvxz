00:03.500 --> 00:05.365
MAYBE SHE'S DEAD.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.038
MISSED ME BY A HAIR.

00:07.070 --> 00:09.231
I'M REALLY HUNGRY,
AND I WANNA GET DRUNK.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.703
PECK, PUT YOUR HEADGEAR ON.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.042
THE MISSION'S OURS.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.116
YEAH, THAT'S A GIRAFFE.

00:21.150 --> 00:22.617
IT'S A CAMEL.

00:27.790 --> 00:30.486

BUT NOW IT'S ALL RIGHT *

00:30.530 --> 00:33.192
MCNALLY'S DOWN.

00:33.230 --> 00:35.391
WHAT ABOUT PECK?
SHE'S PROBABLY HIDING
BEHIND A BUNKER SOMEWHERE,

00:35.430 --> 00:37.489
DRINKING A WINE COOLER.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.236
WATCH MY BACK.
I'LL DO A HEAD CHECK.

HERE'S THE PLAN.
THEY THINK WE'RE DOWN, RIGHT?

00:45.340 --> 00:46.807
SO YOU TWO,
PUSH THE LEFT TAPE LINE

00:46.840 --> 00:48.307
AND LEAVE THE REST TO ME.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.501

01:11.170 --> 01:12.728
NO. BUT WE GOT 'EM PINNED.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.767

01:16.810 --> 01:18.539
DIAZ, YOU WATCH YOUR SIX.

01:19.810 --> 01:22.108
YOU THINK THIS IS A GOOD PLAN?
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.243
I WAS IN THE ARMY, REMEMBER?
I'VE TRAINED FOR THIS.

(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

02:44.660 --> 02:46.389
I MEAN, ARE THEY SERIOUS?

02:46.430 --> 02:47.522
THEY'VE ONLY BEEN SEEING
EACH OTHER A LITTLE WHILE.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.697
THEY'RE NOT SERIOUS.

02:48.730 --> 02:50.561
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.679

03:49.460 --> 03:50.859
WATCH OUT. (giggles)
LET'S WADDLE.

03:50.890 --> 03:52.790
YEAH.

03:52.830 --> 03:53.922
(radio chatter)

03:53.960 --> 03:55.825
OUR DIVISION
HAS A LITTLE PROBLEM--

03:55.860 --> 03:58.920
SIX A.T.M. HOLDUPS
IN THE LAST WEEK.

03:58.970 --> 04:00.597
WE BELIEVE IT'S THE SAME GUY.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.891
WHAT ARE THE LINKS?

04:01.940 --> 04:03.669
FROM ALL ACCOUNTS,
HE'S 5'10", MEDIUM BUILD.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.836
THIS GUY'S QUICK AND DIRTY.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.474
HE WAITS TILL HIS VICTIMS
HAVE THEIR MONEY,

04:06.510 --> 04:08.569
COMES IN WITH HIS GUN,
TAKES WHAT THEY GOT.

04:08.610 --> 04:12.444
BUT THEN BEFORE HE LEAVES,
HE GIVES THEM BACK A $20.
YEAH.

04:12.480 --> 04:14.471
HE'S ALWAYS COMPLETELY MASKED,

04:14.520 --> 04:16.044
SO THE CAMERAS HAVEN'T
GIVEN US ANYTHING,

04:16.080 --> 04:19.550
BUT LAST NIGHT HE GAVE US
A LITTLE SHOW.

04:19.590 --> 04:20.716
UH... WHAT'S HE DOING?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.728
WAIT FOR IT.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.784
(groans and laughter)

04:23.830 --> 04:25.388
DO THEY CALL THAT
AN ASS SLEEVE?

04:25.430 --> 04:28.888
RIGHT NOW IT'S THE ONLY
CONCRETE LEAD WE HAVE.

04:28.930 --> 04:31.069
WE CAN'T ASK TO SEE
THAT TATTOO WITHOUT A WARRANT.

04:31.100 --> 04:34.797
(screen clicks off)
CORRECT. OUR DETECT IVES HAVE
NARROWED IT DOWN TO TEN GUYS,

04:34.840 --> 04:38.003
BASED ON WITNESS STATEMENTS
AND PROBABILITY.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.405
THESE GUYS ARE ALL KNOWN
TO US.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.407
WE NEED YOU
TO START RULING 'EM OUT.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.839
TRACK 'EM DOWN. QUESTION 'EM.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.872
IF THEY DON'T HAVE
ROCK-SOLID ALIBIS, BRING 'EM IN.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.969
WE'RE GONNA BREAK YOU UP
INTO DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.739
EACH TEAM WILL TAKE
A COUPLE OF THESE GUYS.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.984
WE'LL FIND 'EM, SIR.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.351
(officers murmuring)

04:52.390 --> 04:53.857

04:53.890 --> 04:56.324
THIS BIG DIVISION

05:03.600 --> 05:05.488
CHLOE'S COME OVER
FROM 27 DIVISION

05:05.530 --> 05:08.328
AFTER EIGHT MONTHS
ON THE FORCE.
MM-HMM.

05:08.370 --> 05:10.429
AND, UH, SHE HAPPENS TO BE
MY GODDAUGHTER.

05:10.470 --> 05:12.938
(officers murmuring)
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S
GONNA GET SPECIAL TREATMENT.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.972
HEY, FROINK.
HEY, EVERYBODY.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.568

05:39.740 --> 05:41.435
I NEED YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR.

05:41.470 --> 05:42.835
KEEP HER OUT OF TROUBLE.

05:48.810 --> 05:50.368
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:50.410 --> 05:51.547
EXCUSE ME.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.673
WAIT UP, PARTNER.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.808
HERE, I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

05:58.850 --> 06:01.853
OH, I KNOW YOU. YOU'RE GONNA
NEED SOMETHING TO CHEW TODAY.

06:04.690 --> 06:06.521
SO I'VE GOT THE LIST
OF SUSPECT S, ADDRESSES.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.791
YEAH. SO DO I.
QUEEN EAST, RIGHT?

06:09.830 --> 06:10.967
YEP.

06:16.070 --> 06:17.628
I WAS JUST GONNA DRIVE.

06:17.670 --> 06:20.070
I MEAN, UNLESS YOU
WANNA DRIVE. GO AHEAD.

06:20.110 --> 06:23.876
OH. HOW ABOUT THIS?
YOU DRIVE.

06:23.910 --> 06:26.640
(radio chatter)

06:31.020 --> 06:33.909
(clears throat)
(closes door)

06:33.960 --> 06:36.656
SO, UH...
GOT ANY IDEAS?

06:36.690 --> 06:38.180
YEAH, NICKY RADAR.
EVERY TIME I RUN INTO THAT GUY,

06:38.230 --> 06:41.097
HE'S EERILY POLITE.
IT'S UNNERVING.

06:41.130 --> 06:43.724
WELL, I'M THINKING, UH,
FELIX WHITALL.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.466
SAYS HERE FELIX HAS A HISTORY
OF VANDALISM, PRANKS.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.592
THAT'S CLOWN STU FF.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.904
OKAY. GIVING BACK THE $20
SEEMS LIKE NICKY'S STYLE.

06:49.940 --> 06:51.805
IS IT NICKY'S STYLE
TO MOON THE CAMERA?

06:51.840 --> 06:53.831
IT JUST SEEMS
MORE PRANKSTER TO ME.

06:53.880 --> 06:54.972
WELL, FELIX IS IN JAMESTOWN,

06:55.010 --> 06:56.443
AND THAT'S NOT
OUR ASSIGNED AREA.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.675
YEAH, I DON'T THINK THAT
REALLY MATTERS TO SAM,

06:58.710 --> 07:00.075
AS LONG AS WE BRING
THE RIGHT GUY IN.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.576
(radio chatter)
SURE.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.986
(starts engine)

07:04.020 --> 07:05.089
(shifts gears)

07:08.020 --> 07:09.112
I CALLED YOU
TO GIVE YOU A HEADS-UP.

07:09.160 --> 07:10.752
YOU COULD HAVE
LEFT A MESSAGE.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.155
I LEFT A DOZEN MESSAGES.

07:12.190 --> 07:14.658
YEAH. WEIRD MESSAGES,
ANGRY MESSAGES, CREEPY MESSAGES.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.826
YOU NEVER ONCE SAID
YOU WERE A COP,

07:15.860 --> 07:17.293
STARTING
AT 15 DIVISION.

07:17.330 --> 07:20.697
(siren whoops in distance)
BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE
THE JUICE OF THE CALL.

07:20.740 --> 07:23.834
YOU CAN'T SPILL THE JUICE
OF THE CALL ON VOICE MAIL.

07:23.870 --> 07:25.633
WHY NOT?
(bag thuds)

07:25.670 --> 07:26.705
(closes trunk)
'CAUSE THE WHOLE POINT
OF GIVING YOU THE JUICE

07:26.740 --> 07:28.173
IS SO I CAN WITNESS
THE RESPONSE.

07:28.210 --> 07:30.508
LOOK, DO YOU BELIEVE
IN FATE?

07:30.550 --> 07:31.699
NO.
BECAUSE, I MEAN, COME ON--

07:31.750 --> 07:33.741
DON'T YOU THINK FROINK
PUTTING US TOGETHER?

07:33.780 --> 07:35.008
WHY DO YOU CALL HIM
"FROINK"?

07:35.050 --> 07:36.745
DO I NEED A REASON?

07:36.790 --> 07:37.882
(car door opens)

07:40.020 --> 07:41.908
(siren whooping)

07:41.960 --> 07:43.587
YOU TRANSFERRED TO 15 DIVISION
'CAUSE OF ME.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.756
(closes door)
IT CAN'T HAPPEN THAT FAST.

07:44.790 --> 07:45.984
YOU KNOW THAT.
(seat belt CIICKS)

07:46.030 --> 07:47.622
PLUS IT WASN'T MY CHOICE,
OKAY?

07:47.660 --> 07:49.196
I TOTALLY GOT CHASED
OUTTA THERE.

07:49.230 --> 07:50.595
DO YOU HAVE A TISSUE,
ACTUALLY?

07:50.630 --> 07:52.188
WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "CHASED"?

07:52.230 --> 07:54.790
UH... I GRATED
THE STAFF SERGEANT'S NERVES,

07:54.840 --> 07:57.900
AND MY SO-CALLED PARTNER
REQUESTED A SWITCH,

07:57.940 --> 07:59.874
AND NOBODY WANTED
TO RIDE WITH ME.

07:59.910 --> 08:02.003
AND SO... (sniffles)
FROINK PULLED SOME STRINGS

08:02.040 --> 08:03.041
AND GOT ME HERE.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.047
(horn honks in distance)

08:04.080 --> 08:05.604
BUT W-WHY?

08:05.650 --> 08:07.515
'CAUSE HE KNOWS I'M GOOD.
THANK YOU.

08:07.550 --> 08:09.541
(radio chatter)
LOOK...

08:09.590 --> 08:10.579
I'VE ONLY BEEN A COP
FOR EIGHT MONTHS,

08:10.620 --> 08:14.716
BUT I'VE BEEN TRAINING
TO DO THIS MY ENTIRE LIFE.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.887
INDIRECT LY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

08:16.930 --> 08:20.855
OKAY. SOME PEOPLE...
ARE DIRECT.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.164
YOU KNOW, THEY--THEY WALK
A STRAIGHT LINE.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.293
AND OTHERS ARE--THEY'RE--
THEY'RE SQUIGGLY,

08:25.330 --> 08:27.537
AND THEY, LIKE,
GO THIS WAY AND THAT WAY.

08:27.570 --> 08:29.606
AND THAT'S JUST MORE ME,
YOU KNOW?

08:29.640 --> 08:32.063
AND PLUS I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE MEANING OF THE WORD "NO"

08:32.110 --> 08:35.238
IN ANY LANGUAGE,
SO THAT MAKES ME PRETTY DOGGED.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.544
OW.

08:37.580 --> 08:39.275
OW. DO YOU EVER GET
ONE OF THOSE AIR BUBBLES

08:39.310 --> 08:41.073
UNDER YOUR KNEECAP?

08:41.120 --> 08:43.008
OW, IT FEELS WEIRD.

08:43.050 --> 08:44.711
(groans)
(radio chatter)

08:44.750 --> 08:46.559
ARE WE GOING?

08:46.590 --> 08:48.182
(pop)
OH, DID YOU HEAR THAT POP?

08:48.220 --> 08:50.085
(turns key in ignition)

08:50.130 --> 08:52.894
ALL RIGHT, THE CLOSEST ONE
ON THIS LIST

08:52.930 --> 08:55.854
IS THIS GUY--
BEAVERTAIL BOULOS.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.891
WHAT KIND OF NAME
IS THAT?

08:57.930 --> 09:02.902
(chuckles) UH, OR WE COULD SWING
BY THIS GUY STEVE HADDOCK.

09:02.940 --> 09:05.158
MM-HMM.
THEY'RE BOTH PRETTY CLOSE.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.609
OR THROW SOME DARTS
AT A WALL.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.904
SEE WHERE THEY LAND.
YOU LOVE DARTS.

09:08.940 --> 09:10.601
YEAH, BUT DARTS
ARE A THING OF THE PAST.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.242
I'M A DAD NOW, SO...

09:12.280 --> 09:14.578
(radio chatter)
OR WE COULD THINK.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.611
SEE THIS ASS?

09:16.650 --> 09:18.015
YEAH.

09:18.050 --> 09:19.756
YEAH? ALL RIGHT, WE'RE
GONNA HIT SOME INK SHOPS,

09:19.790 --> 09:22.782
AND WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
WHOSE WORK THIS IS.

09:22.830 --> 09:26.152
OR... YEAH.
WE COULD DO THAT.

09:28.260 --> 09:30.296
WHY WOULD ANYONE HAVE A BIKE
AND LEAVE IT LOCKED UP

09:30.330 --> 09:32.833
OUTSIDE A STORE FOR A MONTH?
STORE OWNER FINALLY CUT IT OFF.

09:32.870 --> 09:35.338
I'M STILL STUMPED ON WHY
ANYONE WOULD HAVE A BIKE.

09:35.370 --> 09:36.462
IS THAT ALL THE STUFF
THAT'S BEING AUCTIONED?

09:36.500 --> 09:39.139
YEAH. JUST... I DON'T KNOW.
JUST PUT IT AGAINST THAT.

09:39.170 --> 09:42.003
THAT'S ALL THE PROPERTY FOUND
WITHIN THE LAST YEAR.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.272
(slurps)

09:46.310 --> 09:47.743
AHH!

09:47.780 --> 09:50.385
(exhales) IT'S FOR
A CLEANSE I'M DOING.

09:50.420 --> 09:52.718
IT'S REALLY DISGUSTING,
AND I WANT YOU TO TRY IT.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.352
NO. NOT WITH
THAT INTRODUCTION.

09:54.390 --> 09:56.017
BUT IT'S AWFUL.

09:56.060 --> 09:57.687
SO? THROW IT OUT.
I'M NOT DRINKING IT.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.948
I THOUGHT WE WERE...

10:00.000 --> 10:01.353
SORT OF...
WHAT?

10:01.400 --> 10:04.221
ENGAGED... ISH.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.022
DOESN'T THAT MEAN WE SHARE
EACH OTHER'S MISERY?

10:06.070 --> 10:07.059
BETTER OR WORSE?

10:07.100 --> 10:09.136
NO, IT MEANS I WON'T LEAVE YOU
IF YOU GET CANCER.

10:09.170 --> 10:11.035
I'M NOT DRINKING
YOUR DISGUSTING DRINK.

10:11.070 --> 10:13.334
WIMP.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.972
(child shouting indistinctly)

10:15.010 --> 10:18.798
(siren whoops)

10:18.850 --> 10:20.249
HEY, GUYS.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.918
(engine turns off)

10:21.950 --> 10:22.985
(horn blares in distance)

10:23.020 --> 10:24.214
(keys jangle)

10:24.250 --> 10:25.888
HOW YOU DOING?
(boys) GOOD.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.251
YEAH?

10:27.290 --> 10:29.110
(siren whoops)
YEAH!

10:29.160 --> 10:31.424
(laughs) I LOVE KIDS.

10:31.460 --> 10:35.328
YEAH, AND FIVE YEARS FROM NOW,
THEY'RE GONNA BE SPITTING ON US.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.363
HEY. ANY OF YOU GUYS
KNOW FELIX WHITALL?

10:38.400 --> 10:40.664
YEAH. HE'S MY BROTHER.

10:40.700 --> 10:41.894
HE'S NO LONGER
AT HIS LAST KNOWN ADDRESS.

10:41.940 --> 10:43.362
DID HE MOVE BACK HERE
WITH YOU AND YOUR MOM?

10:43.410 --> 10:44.365
YEAH.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.105
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
WE CAN FIND HIM RIGHT NOW?

10:46.140 --> 10:47.107
WE JUST HAVE TO ASK HIM
A FEW QUESTIONS.

10:47.140 --> 10:48.300
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

10:48.340 --> 10:52.106
HE WAS WORKING
AT THE DOLLAR STORE ON ROSE.

10:52.150 --> 10:53.970
HE'S GOT IT TOGETHER, YOU KNOW.
HE'S TRYING.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.772
GREAT. THANK YOU.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.685
(men speaking indistinctly)

10:57.720 --> 10:58.982
DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?

10:59.020 --> 11:00.112
I MEAN, I THINK
HE BELIEVES HIMSELF.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.287
WHETHER OR NOT HIS BROTHER'S
LIVING STRAIGHT OR NOT...

11:02.320 --> 11:03.423
(gasps)

11:03.460 --> 11:06.452
(alarm wailing)

11:06.490 --> 11:08.321
WHAT THE HELL?

11:08.360 --> 11:09.964
(wailing continues)

11:10.000 --> 11:12.093
STAY AWAY FROM THE CAR!

11:15.440 --> 11:18.807
(wailing continues)

11:22.080 --> 11:23.707
I THINK
IT'S WANDA STARKES'.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.047
YOU KNOW HER?
YEAH, I'VE DEALT WITH HER
A FEW TIMES.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.071
I MEAN, SHE'S GOT SOME ISSUES,
BUT SHE'S HARMLESS.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.145
YOU'RE DRIVING EVERYONE NUTS,
YOU STUPID BITCH.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.408
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT
A REST?

11:30.450 --> 11:31.883
(man and woman
shouting indistinctly)

11:31.920 --> 11:34.753
(shatters)
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH!

11:34.790 --> 11:36.257
GET YOUR UGLY FACE
OUTTA HERE!
(alarm clock blaring,
loud whirring)

11:36.290 --> 11:37.757
(Marlo) OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HERE?

11:37.790 --> 11:38.757
HEY, HEY, HEY, DON'T TASE ME.
DON'T TASE ME.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.189
I CAN'T TAKE GETTING
TASED AGAIN. I REALLY CAN'T.

11:40.230 --> 11:42.198
OKAY, WE'RE NOT HERE
TO TASE ANYBODY, WANDA.

11:42.230 --> 11:43.492
IT'S YOU.
OFFICER MCNALLY, RIGHT?

11:43.530 --> 11:45.862
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?

11:45.900 --> 11:48.334
ANDY, I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING.
YOU KNOW ME, RIGHT?
WHO THREW THE TV OUT THE WINDOW?

11:48.370 --> 11:49.234
HE DID.

11:49.270 --> 11:50.862
I ASKED HER NICELY
ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES

11:50.910 --> 11:51.968
TO SHUT THIS DOWN.
YOU HEAR THIS?

11:52.010 --> 11:55.104
SHE'S GOT EVERY MACHINE
IN THE WORLD GOING IN HERE.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.301
COME WITH ME. COME ON.
LET'S GO.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.443
I'M GONNA TURN
SOME OF THESE THINGS OFF.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.277
YEAH, YEAH, I WAS JUST,
YOU KNOW,

12:01.320 --> 12:03.185
MAKING SURE EVERYTHING WORKED.
THAT'S ALL.

12:03.220 --> 12:06.314
(whirring stops)

12:06.350 --> 12:08.409
(music playing,
alarm clock continues blaring)

12:08.460 --> 12:10.018
(handcuffs click)
LOOK, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE, OKAY,

12:10.060 --> 12:11.755
TO--TO LIVE NEXT TO A LOON
LIKE THAT.

12:11.790 --> 12:13.826
DON'T I?
HOW DO YOU KNOW, SIR?

12:13.860 --> 12:15.157
DO YOU KNOW ME?

12:15.200 --> 12:16.258
NO. I-I DON'T.

12:16.300 --> 12:19.098
BUT SHE'S A CRAZY BITCH.
I'M TELLING YOU.

12:19.130 --> 12:20.131
FOR ALL YOU KNOW,
I TAKE GREAT OFFENSE

12:20.170 --> 12:22.388
TO MEN REFERRING TO WOMEN
WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES

12:22.440 --> 12:24.305
AS "CRAZY BITCH ES."

12:24.340 --> 12:26.262
JUST GO LISTEN
THROUGH THE WALLS.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.301
SHE MAKES SO MUCH NOISE.
I WORK NIGHTS.

12:28.340 --> 12:31.104
YEAH, OKAY, I GET IT.
POTS AND PANS BANGING,

12:31.150 --> 12:32.401
SCREAMING--
GETS IN YOUR HEAD,

12:32.450 --> 12:34.918
MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE THE ONE GOING CRAZY.

12:34.950 --> 12:36.417
YEAH, MUST BE TOUGH.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.816
SO YOU CALL IT IN.

12:38.850 --> 12:40.351

12:49.130 --> 12:51.018
(receiver clatters)
ALL RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENED?

12:51.070 --> 12:54.039
(man speaking indistinctly
on radio)
NOTHING. IT'S JUST
ONE OF THOSE DAYS, YOU KNOW?

12:54.070 --> 12:56.436
I NEEDED... SOUNDS.
I NEEDED SOMETHING INTENSE,

12:56.470 --> 12:57.960
YOU KNOW, TO TAKE OVER.

12:58.010 --> 12:59.261
TAKE OVER WHAT?

12:59.310 --> 13:00.402

13:00.440 --> 13:02.431

I HATE THAT LITTLE KID.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.911
I-I KNOW, BUT YOU CAN'T
LET HIM GET TO YOU, YOU KNOW?

13:10.950 --> 13:12.281

HE RIPS MY TV OUT OF THE WALL,

(changing frequenCIes)

13:20.030 --> 13:24.091
ARE YOU GOING TO ARREST HIM?
YES, HE WILL BE DEALT WITH.
I PROMISE.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.529
(piano playing

13:25.570 --> 13:28.198

13:40.950 --> 13:43.043

13:43.090 --> 13:45.388

14:04.610 --> 14:06.464
(inhales and exhales deeply)

14:06.510 --> 14:09.035
(radio chatter, siren wailing)

14:09.080 --> 14:11.378
(indistinct conversations)

14:11.410 --> 14:13.844
(telephone ringing)

14:16.350 --> 14:18.386
THIS WAS LEFT
IN A VACANT APARTMENT.

14:18.420 --> 14:21.309
OKAY.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.887
I BELIEVE THERE ARE
CREMATED HUMAN REMAINS IN IT.

14:31.170 --> 14:35.334
YEP. THOSE ARE CREMATED
HUMAN REMAINS, ALL RIGHT.

14:37.070 --> 14:39.459
(door buzzes)
SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO?

14:39.510 --> 14:41.102
DID YOU CONTACT
THE PREVIOUS TENANTS?

14:41.140 --> 14:42.971
THEY WERE
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.

14:43.010 --> 14:45.069
THEY RAN OUT ON ME
TWO MONTHS' RENT.

14:45.110 --> 14:48.079
I DIDN'T WANNA TOSS IT IN CASE
THE PERSON MATTERED TO SOMEONE.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.941
SOMEONE WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO CREMATE THE BODY

14:50.990 --> 14:53.356
AND, UH, PICK OUT
A LOVELY URN.

14:53.390 --> 14:55.483
IT'S VERY LOVELY. OKAY,
WELL, WE'LL HANG ON TO IT

14:55.520 --> 14:56.612
AND STORE IT
IN THE PROPERTIES ROOM

14:56.660 --> 14:59.083
UNTIL I CAN TRACK DOWN
A FAMILY MEMBER.

14:59.130 --> 15:02.054
JUST GONNA NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS, ALL RIGHT?

15:02.100 --> 15:03.965
THIS GUY KINDA LOOKS
LIKE MY BROTHER,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.127
BUT MAYBE THAT'S, LIKE,
HIS DECOY, YOU KNOW?

15:06.170 --> 15:08.934
AND THEN THERE'S THIS GUY,
WHO--I MEAN, LOOK AT THOSE EYES.
(rustles papers)

15:08.970 --> 15:10.608
MY MONEY'S
ON MIGUEL GARCIAS.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.460
DONE. LET'S FIND HIM.

15:12.510 --> 15:14.535
(sets down file)

15:14.580 --> 15:17.071
ALL RIGHT,
HOW DOES A GUY GET SO LUCKY?

15:17.110 --> 15:18.543
SIX HOLDUPS,
AND EVERY TIME,

15:18.580 --> 15:20.343
HE SEEMS TO FLUKE
INTO BIG MONEY?

15:20.380 --> 15:21.642
I KNOW. MOST GUYS WHO DO
THIS SORT OF THING--

15:21.680 --> 15:23.989
THEY GET PEOPLE
TO DRAIN THEIR ACCOUNTS.

15:24.020 --> 15:26.989
BUT NOT THIS GUY. YET HE ALWAYS
MANAGES TO SCORE BIG.

15:27.020 --> 15:28.658
(radio chatter)
HMM.

15:28.690 --> 15:30.351
OKAY, HERE'S A PLAN.

15:30.390 --> 15:31.618
LET'S GET
SOME NICE ICED COFFEES,

15:31.660 --> 15:34.094
AND MAYBE A LITTLE BROWNIE
OR SOMETHING YUMMY,

15:34.130 --> 15:35.620
AND THEN WE CAN GO BY
ALL THE A.T.--
OKAY, THIS IS NOT A DATE.

15:35.660 --> 15:36.991
WE ARE TRYING TO GET
A MENACE OFF THE STREETS.

15:37.030 --> 15:38.327
DO YOU GET THAT?

15:38.370 --> 15:40.998
YEAH, I DO.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.531
HEY.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.333

15:48.380 --> 15:51.144
NO. JUST DROPPING OFF
AN ABANDONED URN.

15:51.180 --> 15:53.444
WITH ASHES IN IT?

15:53.480 --> 15:55.141
YEAH.
I'M GONNA LEAVE IT HERE

15:55.180 --> 15:57.341
WHILE I TRY TO TRACK DOWN
THE FAMILY.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.608
DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION?
BASED ON THE MANUFACTURER,

15:59.650 --> 16:01.356
THERE ARE TWO FUNERAL HOMES
IN TOWN

16:01.390 --> 16:03.585
THAT CARRY THIS,
SO I'M WORKING FROM THERE.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.726
HMM. OKAY. WELL... LET ME KNOW
WHAT YOU COME UP WITH.

16:07.760 --> 16:10.365
WHY?
ARE YOU FEELING FOR IT?

16:10.400 --> 16:13.597
I ONLY WANNA KNOW, BECAUSE
IF SOMEONE COMES TO GET HIM,

16:13.640 --> 16:15.767
I DON'T WANNA PUT HIM
ON THE AUCTION PILE.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.337
RIGHT.

16:18.370 --> 16:20.235
(door buzzes in distance)

16:35.490 --> 16:38.050
(shifts gears, turns off engine)

16:38.090 --> 16:40.627
(indistinct conversations)

16:40.660 --> 16:42.719
(car doors close)
HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW
MIGUEL'S HERE?

16:42.760 --> 16:44.159
I'VE BEEN WORKING
THIS DIVISION FOUR YEARS.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.792
I KNOW. STAY HERE.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.765
(siren wailing in distance)

16:48.800 --> 16:51.769
(men speaking indistinctly,
police radio chatter)

16:51.810 --> 16:54.131
(hip-hop music playing)

16:54.180 --> 16:56.102
HEY, MIGUEL?

16:56.140 --> 16:57.676
MIND IF I ASK YOU
A COUPLE QUESTIONS?

16:57.710 --> 17:00.270
**

17:00.320 --> 17:02.470
LAST NIGHT, 11:00 P.M.--YOU
WANNA TELL ME WHERE YOU WERE?

17:02.520 --> 17:03.680
OR YOU COULD JUST SAVE US
ALL SOME TIME

17:03.720 --> 17:05.210
AND SHOW US YOUR ASS.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.740
(laughter)

17:06.790 --> 17:08.348
OFFICER PRICE.

17:08.390 --> 17:11.382
ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?
YES, I AM.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.421
YOUR RIGHT BUTT CHEEK,
TO BE EXACT.

17:13.460 --> 17:16.395
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A VERY SPECIFIC TATTOO.

17:16.430 --> 17:18.796
(laughs)
DON'T BE SHY.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.800
(belt buckle jangling)
YO.

17:23.840 --> 17:27.571
THANK YOU, MIGUEL.
YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

17:27.610 --> 17:29.100
YES...

17:29.140 --> 17:30.744
THANK YOU, MIGUEL,
FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

17:30.780 --> 17:33.772
GENTLEMEN,
HAVE A NICE DAY.

17:33.820 --> 17:37.779
(indistinct conversations,
dog barking in distance)

17:37.820 --> 17:39.378
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT
WITHOUT A WARRANT.

17:39.420 --> 17:40.580
I DIDN'T FORCE HIM
TO DO ANYTHING.

17:40.620 --> 17:41.814
STILL, IT WAS STUPID.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.078
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T LIKE THAT WORD.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.451
FINE. I'M JUST SAYING YOU COULD
GET IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

17:46.490 --> 17:48.094
HE COULD CHARGE YOU
WITH HARASSMENT.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.529
HE WOULD LOSE FACE
IN FRONT OF HIS FRIENDS

17:49.560 --> 17:51.767
IF HE DID THAT, OKAY?
HE WAS FLATTERED.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.462
AND BY THE WAY, YOU WERE,
LIKE, SO MUCH MORE FUN

17:54.500 --> 17:57.367
WHEN YOU WERE DRUNK.
JUST F.Y.I.

17:57.410 --> 18:01.801
**

18:04.550 --> 18:07.519
(cash register beeping,
telephone ringing)

18:10.720 --> 18:12.517
FELIX WHITALL?

18:12.550 --> 18:14.381
(police radio chatter)
YEAH.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.149
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

18:16.190 --> 18:18.556
WHAT?
UH, DO YOU MIND TELLING US

18:18.590 --> 18:20.319
WHERE YOU WERE LAST NIGHT
AROUND 11:00?

18:20.360 --> 18:22.851
YEAH. I WAS HERE.
I WAS WORKING.

18:22.900 --> 18:26.666
AND YOUR MANAGER
COULD VERIFY THAT?
(radio chatter continues)

18:26.700 --> 18:28.361
HEY, LOOK, COME ON. I'VE--
I'VE BEEN LIVING STRAIGHT

18:28.400 --> 18:29.799
FOR MONTHS, OKAY?

18:33.940 --> 18:36.477
OKAY, LOOK, UM...
FELIX, DON'T E--

18:38.750 --> 18:40.445
EXCUSE ME.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.415
(panﬁng)

18:53.430 --> 18:56.752
(grunting)

18:56.800 --> 19:00.395
(groans) COME ON.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.737
(handcuffs click)

19:01.770 --> 19:04.659
UHH!
I LOVE IT WHEN I'M RIGHT.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.234
NINE YEARS ON THE JOB,
AND THE ONE THING I KNOW

19:06.270 --> 19:07.407
IS INNOCENT PEOPLE DON'T RUN
FROM THE COPS.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.271
THAT'S NOT WHY I RAN.

19:09.310 --> 19:11.403
OH, YEAH?
WAS IT BECAUSE OF THIS?

19:11.450 --> 19:13.543
THIS IS GONNA LOOK REALLY GOOD
TO YOUR IZA_R$1)L)E OFFICER.
Sig s

19:13.580 --> 19:14.911
(female dispatcher) All units,
we've got an armed robbery.

19:14.950 --> 19:17.384
ATM at Shuter and Sherbrooke.

19:17.420 --> 19:20.287
Appears to be the same suspect
as last night's holdup.
SEE?

19:20.320 --> 19:21.787
(static)
YOU SEE?

19:21.820 --> 19:23.253
WHOEVER YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,
IT'S NOT ME.

19:23.290 --> 19:24.484
(static)
1504. WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.486
OH, YEAH,
YOU'RE REAL INNOCENT.

19:26.530 --> 19:29.499
(sirens wailing)

19:29.530 --> 19:32.465
(indistinct conversations)

19:36.400 --> 19:38.903
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME DEAL.
MADE OFF WITH 800 BUCKS,

19:38.940 --> 19:41.306
EXCEPT THIS TIME, THE VIC
PUT UP A LITTLE RESISTANCE,

19:41.340 --> 19:43.706
AND OUR GUY BEAT
THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS OUT OF HIM.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.877
SAYS HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,
BUT HE WAS WEARING A MASK.

19:45.910 --> 19:47.241
WHAT ABOUT SURVEILLANCE?

19:47.280 --> 19:48.770
WE'RE WAITING ON FOOTAGE.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.880
THE ONLY THING HE SAID
TO THE VICTIM--

19:51.920 --> 19:54.809
"LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL."
WELL, THAT'S IRONIC.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.748
MAYBE THIS GUY'S JUST GETTING
BORED WITH TAKING MONEY.

19:56.790 --> 19:59.679
FIRST, HE MOONS THE CAMERA,
NOW HE'S BEATING PEOPLE UP.

19:59.730 --> 20:01.391
I'M GONNA GO TO THE HOSPITAL
WITH THE VICTIM,

20:01.430 --> 20:03.694
AND I'LL GET HIS OFFICIAL
STATEMENT ONCE HE'S SETTLED.

20:03.730 --> 20:05.960
WELL, YOU CAN RULE OUT
FELIX WHITALL.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.695
WE WERE WITH HIM
WHEN THE CALL CAME IN.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.696
WHAT? YOU WENT AFTER WHITALL?

20:09.740 --> 20:12.402
HE WAS ON THE JAMESTOWN LIST.
I KNOW.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.931
THAT'S NOT YOUR PART OF TOWN.
IT WAS ON THE LIST.

20:14.980 --> 20:17.801
OH, OKAY. CLEARLY YOUR TALENT
ISN'T FOLLOWING ORDERS.

20:17.850 --> 20:20.273
OKAY, WELL,
YOU SAID TO RULE HIM OUT.

20:20.320 --> 20:23.312
DID WHAT YOU ASKED.
IT'S NOT MIGUEL GARCIAS.

20:23.350 --> 20:27.309
OKAY. KEEP MOVING DOWN
YOUR LISTS, PLEASE.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.918
OKAY?

20:28.960 --> 20:30.689
LOOK AT THAT.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.255
WHAT?
THE SOFA.
I MEAN, IMAGINE IT,

20:33.300 --> 20:35.291
REUPHOLSTERED
IN PINK VELVET.

20:35.330 --> 20:37.298
I WOULD KILL
FOR THAT SOFA. (gasps)

20:37.330 --> 20:39.423
AND CHECK OUT THAT BED FRAME.

20:39.470 --> 20:42.268
OH, DON'T MIND ME. I'M JUST--
I'M A SUCKER FOR ANTIQUES.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.905
I LIKE THINGS WITH
A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY.

20:44.940 --> 20:46.931
SHE'S A LITTLE UNFOCUSED.

20:46.970 --> 20:49.473
(radio chatter)

20:51.450 --> 20:54.271
(man) * WHERE YOU GOING NOW?

20:54.320 --> 20:57.949
* YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO
(needle buzzmg)

20:57.990 --> 21:00.959
* I CAN LEAD YOU DOWN
(door opens, bells jingle)

21:00.990 --> 21:03.720
HEY, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
(door closes)

21:03.760 --> 21:05.785
OH, NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WHAT--WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

21:05.830 --> 21:08.754
WELL, SIR, WE WERE TOLD
THAT THIS IS YOUR WORK.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.688
YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S MINE.

21:10.730 --> 21:11.890
YEAH? CAN YOU REMEMBER
WHO YOU GAVE IT TO?

21:11.930 --> 21:13.397
UH... YEAH. YEAH.
I REMEMBER THIS GUY.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.793
HE'S, UH...

21:14.840 --> 21:16.796
HE'S A NICE KID.
UH, QUIET. POLITE.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.467
UM, READ A BOOK THE WHOLE TIME.

21:18.510 --> 21:20.432
OH, YEAH? CAN YOU TELL US
WHO HE IS?

21:20.480 --> 21:23.449
NEVER GOT HIS NAME. UM...
HE HAD BROWN HAIR, THOUGH.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.869
BROWN HAIR. ANY--
ANYTHING ELSE?

21:25.910 --> 21:27.070
HE WAS BIG INTO WORDS.
LOT OF WORDS.

21:27.110 --> 21:30.489
ALL OVER HIS ARMS, CHEST, LEGS.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.080
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MAN?
YOU GOT ANY INK?

21:33.120 --> 21:36.954
OH. NO. NO. I MEAN,
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED ONE,

21:36.990 --> 21:40.892
BUT, UH...
I'M A DAD NOW.

21:40.930 --> 21:43.922
SO... YEAH, MY SON'S NAME
IS CHRISTIAN.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.926
WE'RE GONNA LET YOU
GET BACK TO IT.

21:45.970 --> 21:47.597
LOOKS GREAT.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.938
BYE NOW.
(Chris) THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

21:49.970 --> 21:52.768
THAT WAS WEIRD. YEAH.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.072
(buzzing resumes)

21:54.110 --> 21:55.998
(door bells jingle)

21:56.040 --> 21:57.746
YEAH, WE SHOULD CALL THE TROOPS
AND TELL THEM

21:57.780 --> 22:00.840
ABOUT OUR CONVERSATION
WITH MR. INK, ALL RIGHT?

22:00.880 --> 22:03.485
UH, BROWN HAIR, LOTS OF WORDS.
MAYBE--I DON'T KNOW.

22:03.520 --> 22:06.387
MAYBE IT'LL NARROW IT DOWN
A BIT.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.354
DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD
KEEP THIS TO OURSELVES?

22:08.390 --> 22:10.551
I MEAN, I'M KIND OF LOOKING
FOR A COMMENDATION WHERE I'M A--

22:10.590 --> 22:12.558
YOU KNOW, I'M A DAD.
OH, YEAH, DIAZ.

22:12.590 --> 22:14.399
YOU'RE A DAD.
YOU'RE A DAD. I KNOW.

22:14.430 --> 22:17.467
YOU GOT KIDS. I GOT KIDS.
EVERYBODY HAS KIDS.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.469
LISTEN, LOOK AT ME.
YOU ARE EXACTLY THE SAME GUY

22:20.500 --> 22:23.560
THAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN,
ALL RIGHT?

22:23.610 --> 22:25.931
YOU GOTTA STOP FREAKING OUT
ABOUT THIS.

22:25.970 --> 22:29.474
OR AT LEAST, YOU GOTTA STOP
TALKING ABOUT IT.

22:32.580 --> 22:34.878
(static)
1514. I GOT A COUPLE
OF BREAD CRUMBS ON OUR GUY

22:34.920 --> 22:36.410
IF ANYONE'S INTERESTED.
(static)

22:36.450 --> 22:39.112
GOOD BOY. LET'S GO.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.550
(radio chatter)

22:41.590 --> 22:43.558
FOR THE RECORD,

22:43.590 --> 22:45.888
I'M GONNA TELL SAM IT WAS
MY CALL TO GO AFTER FELIX.

22:45.930 --> 22:48.421
THAT'S FINE, REALLY.

22:48.460 --> 22:50.963
I KNOW THIS ISN'T
A COMFORTABLE SITUATION--

22:51.000 --> 22:52.820
ME, BEING HERE,
THE NEW PERSON.

22:52.870 --> 22:56.135
PEOPLE COME AND GO.
THINGS CHANGE.

22:56.170 --> 22:59.537
YEAH, WELL, I KNOW
YOU'RE WELL-LIKED AND RESPECTED.

22:59.570 --> 23:00.537
I'M NOT TRYING
TO REPLACE YOU.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.947
(chuckles) I KNOW THAT.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.949
SO TIME TO MOVE ON.
I HAVE MOVED ON.

23:06.980 --> 23:10.848
I MEAN, MOVING ON TO THE GUY
YOU WANT TO TRACK DOWN.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.448
WHAT'S HIS NAME? NICKY...
NICKY RADAR.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.014
NICKY RADAR.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.755
I THINK WE SHOULD AT LEAST
RULE HIM OUT.

23:15.790 --> 23:18.520
SO IT SAYS HIS LAST KNOWN
ADDRESS WAS QUEEN EAST.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.925
DO YOU WANNA START
WITH HIS HOUSE?

23:19.960 --> 23:21.655
SURE.
(female dispatcher) 1504,

23:21.700 --> 23:23.463
I need you to head back
to 2923 Gerrard.

23:23.500 --> 23:25.821
There's another 9-1-1 call
regarding your EDP.

23:25.870 --> 23:27.428
(static)
(under breath) CRAP.

23:27.470 --> 23:29.995
(normal voice) IT'S WANDA.
(siren wailing)

23:30.040 --> 23:31.735
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

23:31.770 --> 23:34.102
(receiver off-hook alarm
sounding)

23:34.140 --> 23:36.574
WAN DA?

23:36.610 --> 23:38.043
YOU IN THERE?

23:38.080 --> 23:40.446
(door clatters)

23:40.480 --> 23:43.449
(alarm clock blaring, off-hook
alarm continues sounding)

23:45.150 --> 23:46.515
YOU SAID YOU KNEW
THIS WOMAN.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.025
YEAH, AND YOU SAID
SHE'D BE FINE.

23:59.670 --> 24:01.228
I'M GONNA CHECK THE STAIRWELL,
GO DOWN TO THE EXIT.

24:01.270 --> 24:03.738
(sighs) I'LL CHECK IN
WITH HER NEIGHBORS.

24:03.770 --> 24:05.567
(police radio chatter)

24:05.610 --> 24:07.009
SHE'S NOT A BAD PERSON.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.837
I NEVER SAID
SHE WAS A BAD PERSON.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.507
OKAY? I ASKED YOU
IF SHE'D BE OKAY ON HER OWN,

24:10.550 --> 24:12.609
AND YOU SAID YES.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.587
HELLO? IS ANYONE HOME?

24:20.620 --> 24:23.589
(man speaking indistinctly)

24:28.630 --> 24:30.791
HELLO. IT'S OFFICER CRUZ.
IS ANYONE HOME?

24:30.830 --> 24:32.161
MR. SMITH, ARE YOU THERE?

24:32.200 --> 24:33.189
(door creaks)

24:33.230 --> 24:35.596
HELLO?

24:35.640 --> 24:37.665
POLICE.
IT'S OFFICER CRUZ.

24:39.570 --> 24:42.505
(police radio chatter)

24:45.610 --> 24:47.248
(static)

24:47.280 --> 24:49.612
1504. I NEED BACKUP
TO WILLOW CREEK, APARTMENT 607.

24:49.650 --> 24:51.538
I'M WITH A VICTIM OF A STABBING.

24:51.590 --> 24:53.285
HE'S STILL BREATHING,
BUT HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.050
(static)
(Oliver) This is 1514.
We're on our way.

24:56.090 --> 24:57.819
SIR? SIR?

25:02.130 --> 25:03.597
STAIRWELL'S CLEAR.

25:03.630 --> 25:05.120
(Marlo)
Be careful, McNally.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.139
I found the neighbor down.
It may have been our EDP.

25:08.170 --> 25:11.105
(loud whirring)

25:14.280 --> 25:15.736
HELLO?

25:15.780 --> 25:19.102
(whirring continues)

25:19.150 --> 25:20.208
(whirring stops)

25:20.250 --> 25:22.718
I NEED IT ON.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.615
WANDA, WHAT'S GOING ON?
PEOPLE ARE HATEFUL!

25:24.650 --> 25:26.618
(shovel clatters)

25:26.650 --> 25:27.878
PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT
TO LOOK DOWN ON ME

25:27.920 --> 25:29.615
OR LAUGH IN MY FACE,
SPIT IN MY FACE.

25:29.660 --> 25:30.888
I AM HUMAN
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

25:30.930 --> 25:34.195
THESE BRATS
DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

25:34.230 --> 25:36.095
(crying) I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?
I'M SORRY.

25:36.130 --> 25:38.598
BUT YOU'RE NOT SORRY.
YOU'RE NOT SORRY.

25:38.630 --> 25:40.894
YOU THROW STUFF AT ME.
YOU CALL ME NAMES.
(Dylan speaks indistinctly)

25:40.940 --> 25:44.103
YOU LAUGH IN MY FACE.
OH, LIFE IS SO FUN FOR DYLAN.
YOU GOTTA LET HIM GO, WANDA.

25:44.140 --> 25:46.131
I WON'T DO IT ANYMORE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

25:46.170 --> 25:48.604
(gasping)

25:50.210 --> 25:52.007
(crying)

25:52.050 --> 25:53.074
(coughs)

25:53.110 --> 25:55.613
YOU CAN'T TASE ME.

25:55.650 --> 25:58.118
YOU CAN'T TASE ME NOW,
OR I'LL BLOW UP.

25:58.150 --> 25:59.788
(laughs)
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

25:59.820 --> 26:01.685
I DON'T HAVE A WEAPON.
I KNOW MY RIGHTS.

26:01.720 --> 26:02.880
I KNOW MY RIGHTS.

26:02.920 --> 26:06.128
OKAY. OKAY.

26:06.160 --> 26:09.755
(holsters gun)
BUT YOU HAVE TO COME
WITH ME NOW.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.097
(static)

26:11.130 --> 26:12.597
DON'T! PLEASE DON'T. DON'T.

26:12.630 --> 26:14.188
PLEASE DON'T BRING NO COP
DOWN HERE, PLEASE.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.128
PLEASE. I'LL LISTEN TO YOU.
I KNOW YOU, OKAY?

26:16.170 --> 26:19.367
YEAH.
W-WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT?
RIGHT? RIGHT?

26:19.410 --> 26:21.230
OKAY, JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE
TO CALM DOWN, OKAY?

26:21.280 --> 26:23.601
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.
THEN YOU NEED TO LET
THE BOY GO,

26:23.650 --> 26:25.140
AND YOU'RE GONNA COME WITH ME.
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE JUST GONNA

26:25.180 --> 26:27.717
GO FOR A LITTLE WALK.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

26:27.750 --> 26:31.117
(crying)
PLEASE. I JUST WANNA GO HOME.
I KNOW. WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
OUTTA HERE SOON.

26:31.150 --> 26:35.154
OH, HE'S THE VICTIM, RIGHT?
AND I'M THE BAD GUY.
NO, BUT HE'S A KID,

26:35.190 --> 26:36.748
AND HE PROBABLY DIDN'T MEAN
TO BE THAT RUDE.

26:36.790 --> 26:38.155
HE'S A LITTLE SNOT,
AND HE'S GONNA GROW UP

26:38.190 --> 26:40.385
TO BE A BIGGER SNOT
UNLESS HE LEARNS BETTER.

26:40.430 --> 26:44.093
WANDA... WE NEED TO GET THIS
UNDER CONTROL RIGHT NOW.

26:44.130 --> 26:46.394
OKAY?

26:46.430 --> 26:49.695
THIS LOOKS REALLY BAD
ON ME, TOO.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.037
I VOUCHED FOR YOU.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.179
(whispers) OKAY.

26:57.780 --> 27:00.271
I'LL LET HIM GO...

27:00.310 --> 27:03.711
IF YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.

27:03.750 --> 27:07.686
AM I GOING TO HAVE TO GO
BACK TO THE HOSPITAL?

27:07.720 --> 27:08.857
WHY DON'T WE GO BACK
TO YOUR APARTMENT

27:08.890 --> 27:10.755
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT?

27:10.790 --> 27:12.428
HEY, WE SEARCHED EVERY FLOOR.
WE CAN'T FIND HER.

27:12.460 --> 27:15.156
SIR, SIR, HAVE YOU GOT ANY IDEA
WHERE SHE MIGHT BE?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.690
I KNOW WHERE SHE SHOULD BE.

27:16.730 --> 27:18.368
SHE SHOULD BE
IN THE MENTAL WARD.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.891
(static)
(Andy) Cruz, I'm with Wanda
in the basement.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.430
I could use some help.
CAN YOU STAY WITH HIM?

27:22.470 --> 27:24.233
I CAN GO.
NO, SHE'S MY PARTNER.

27:24.270 --> 27:25.760
OKAY, GO.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.108
(whispers)
IT'S ALL OVER NOW.

27:28.140 --> 27:32.144
I REALLY LIKED HAVING
MY OWN APARTMENT, YOU KNOW?

27:32.180 --> 27:35.274
I WAS DOING GOOD.
I WAS REALLY GOOD.

27:35.320 --> 27:37.811
I'M NOT A BAD PERSON.

27:37.850 --> 27:39.818
(static)
(Marlo)
McNally, where in the basement?

27:39.850 --> 27:41.909
DON'T. DON'T!
DON'T SAY ANYTHING, PLEASE.
I HAVE TO.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.155
(crying) NO. NO. NO
(static) I

27:44.190 --> 27:45.327
WE'RE
IN THE SUPERINTENDANT'S ROOM,

27:45.360 --> 27:47.351
DOWN THE SOUTH END
OF THE BASEMENT.

27:47.390 --> 27:49.221
SHUT UP! I SAID SHUT UP!
GET OUT! SHUT UP!

27:49.260 --> 27:50.693
PUT IT DOWN.

27:50.730 --> 27:52.322
SHUT UP!
PUT IT DOWN.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.065
(Dylan)
I CAN'T STAY IN HERE ANYMORE!
WANDA, NO!

27:54.100 --> 27:56.159
(gunshot)

27:56.200 --> 27:59.306
(panﬁng)

28:09.150 --> 28:11.812
(holsters gun)

28:11.850 --> 28:15.115
(Andy) I HAD IT COVERED.
I WAS DEALING WITH IT.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.354
(siren whoops)
I KNEW HER.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.927
IT WAS EXACTLY WHY
I WAS TALKING HER DOWN.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.894
SHE WAS LISTENING TO ME.
IT'S JUST THE KID STARTLED HER.

28:20.930 --> 28:23.296
WHY WASN'T YOUR GUN OUT?
I WAS ABOUT TO DRAW.

28:23.330 --> 28:25.127
I DREW FIRST.

28:25.170 --> 28:26.797
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU HAVE BEEN
SECOND-GUESSING ME ALL DAY.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.491
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO MANAGE IT.
HEY.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.906
HEY.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.876
YOU GUYS GOT YOUR STORIES
STRAIGHT?

28:34.910 --> 28:36.775
'CAUSE S.I.U.'s GONNA BE
ALL OVER THIS.

28:36.810 --> 28:38.744
THERE'S NO STORY.
SHE WAS FOLLOWING PROTOCOL.

28:38.780 --> 28:40.202
SHE JUST GOT THERE FIRST.

28:40.250 --> 28:42.445
(Frank) SHAW, TAKE CRUZ
BACK TO THE STATION.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.141
DIAZ, TAKE MCNALLY.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.181
KEEP THEM SEPARATED
UNTIL THEY TALK TO S.I.U.

28:46.220 --> 28:49.155
(siren whooping, radio chatter)

28:54.930 --> 28:58.161
WELL, I WISH I KNEW YOUR NAME.

28:58.200 --> 29:01.533
YEAH, EVERYONE NEEDS A NAME,
EVEN IN DEATH.

29:01.570 --> 29:02.992
(click)

29:03.040 --> 29:04.803
EVEN IN YOUR URN.

29:06.340 --> 29:11.175
HOW ABOUT I CALL YOU...
URNIE?

29:11.210 --> 29:12.507
HEY, URNIE.

29:12.550 --> 29:15.246
I KNOW.

29:15.280 --> 29:17.248
BEING ASHES...

29:17.280 --> 29:22.456
STUCK IN YOUR URN
WITH NO ONE TO LOVE YOU.

29:22.490 --> 29:25.288
THAT MUST REALLY SUCK.

29:25.330 --> 29:28.822
BUT AT LEAST YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DRINK THIS TEA.

29:28.860 --> 29:31.966
(slurps)

29:32.000 --> 29:33.797
AHH.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.138
ALL RIGHT, IT'S NOT MIGUEL.
SURE ISN'T. (giggles)

29:36.170 --> 29:37.899
IT'S NOT FELIX.
IT'S NOT STEVE HADDOCK.

29:37.940 --> 29:39.965
HE HAS RED HAIR, SO WE'RE
BASICALLY DOWN TO WHAT,

29:40.010 --> 29:41.170
FOUR GUYS?

29:41.210 --> 29:44.008
OKAY. UM...

29:44.050 --> 29:46.245
BEAVERTAIL'S GOT A FEW B&Es,
VIOLENT HISTORY.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.918
OH, AND CHECK THIS OUT.

29:47.950 --> 29:50.441
IN '05, HE WAS CHARGED
WITH INDECENT EXPOSURE.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.119
HE DROPPED HIS PANTS
IN NIGHT SCHOOL.

29:53.150 --> 29:55.914
HE'S IN JAMESTOWN.
LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.281
UM... WAIT.
WHERE DOES _|\|ICKY RADAR LIVE?
(rustling papers)

29:58.330 --> 30:00.082
(radio chatter)

30:00.130 --> 30:05.568
LOWNEY AVENUE. OKAY,
SO THAT'S QUEEN AND CARLAW.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.158
WHAT?
AH. I DON'T KNOW.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.929
JAMESTOWN DOESN'T HAVE
ANTIQUE STORES.

30:08.970 --> 30:11.131
BUT QUEEN EAST HAS
SOME GREAT LITTLE STORES.

30:11.170 --> 30:13.536
WE'RE NOT GOING AFTER A GUY
SO YOU CAN GO ANTIQUING.

30:13.570 --> 30:16.232
NO, DOV. ALL THE A.T.M.s
THIS GUY HITS

30:16.280 --> 30:18.976
ARE IN NEIGHBORHOODS
WITH COOL LITTLE ANTIQUE SHOPS.

30:19.010 --> 30:21.069
SO? COINCIDENCE.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.042
WELL, MAYBE, BUT THE ONE
THAT WE'RE AT TODAY

30:23.080 --> 30:25.287
HAD A "CASH ONLY" SIGN
IN THE WINDOW.

30:25.320 --> 30:27.584
SO PEOPLE HAVE TO GO
TO NEARBY A.T.M.s

30:27.620 --> 30:29.087
IN ORDER TO GET CASH?

30:29.120 --> 30:31.224
EXACTLY, BECAUSE ANTIQUES
AREN'T CHEAP.

30:31.260 --> 30:32.921
I MEAN, WOULD BEAVERTAIL
KNOW THIS?

30:32.960 --> 30:34.598
I DON'T KNOW.
HIS NAME'S BEAVERTAIL.

30:34.630 --> 30:37.451
PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW MUCH.
HA! YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

30:37.500 --> 30:39.195
(chuckles)

30:39.230 --> 30:41.061
OKAY, WELL, LET'S GO
TO QUEEN EAST THEN.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.091
ALL RIGHT, BUT IF YOU LOOK
INSIDE A STORE WINDOW,

30:43.140 --> 30:44.869
I'M WRITING YOU UP.

30:44.910 --> 30:47.265
RELAX, OKAY?

30:47.310 --> 30:49.631
(door buzzes in distance)

30:49.680 --> 30:51.648
WELL, WELL, WELL.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.114
DON'T YOU
HAVE IT EASY TODAY.

30:54.150 --> 30:55.447
KINDA LOOK LIKE
A SECRETARY.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.038
OH, YEAH? YOU GOT IT
SO TOUGH BACK THERE,

30:57.080 --> 30:58.616
BABYSITTING BICYCLES?

30:58.650 --> 31:01.210
I AM BABYSITTING
HUMAN ASHES.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.557
UH, I TRACKED DOWN
ASHES' FAMILY.

31:02.590 --> 31:06.151
URNIE'S FAMILY?
I MEAN, THE URN.

31:06.190 --> 31:07.589
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

31:07.630 --> 31:09.291
HIS NAME IS ROY POWER.

31:09.330 --> 31:11.195
TRACKED DOWN HIS NEPHEW
IN HAWAII.

31:11.230 --> 31:13.289
ROY LEFT HIS WIFE
FOR A MUCH YOUNGER WOMAN

31:13.330 --> 31:16.060
AND LOST CONTACT
WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.000
AND HIS NEW WIFE DIED
OF A HEART ATTACK LAST YEAR.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.201
SO URN'S HEADING TO HAWAII?

31:20.240 --> 31:23.676
WELL, I'M SUDDENLY JEALOUS
OF ASHES RIGHT NOW.
THEY DON'T WANT HIM.

31:23.710 --> 31:26.304
WHAT DO YOU--WHAT DO--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:26.350 --> 31:27.908
THEY SAID
WE COULD FLUSH HIM.

31:27.950 --> 31:31.613
JUST... FLUSH HIM?
YEAH, OR WHATEVER.

31:31.650 --> 31:35.051
WHAT IF OTHER RELATIVES SHOW UP?
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE
ANY OTHER RELATIVES.

31:35.090 --> 31:38.287
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
FLUSH HIM DOWN THE TOILET?

31:38.330 --> 31:40.127
WELL, WE COULD LEAVE HIM
ON THE SHELF BACK THERE.

31:40.160 --> 31:42.628
FOR ETERNITY?
I DON'T KNOW, GAIL.

31:42.660 --> 31:44.059
YOU'RE WORKING
THE PROPERTY ROOM.

31:44.100 --> 31:46.591
(telephone rings)
YOU DECIDE. OKAY?

31:46.630 --> 31:48.996
(ﬁng)
15 DIVISION.

31:49.040 --> 31:52.567
OKAY, MA'AM, THAT'S NOT
A CALL FOR THE POLICE.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.635
(police radio chatter)

31:54.680 --> 31:55.635
HELLO?

31:55.680 --> 31:58.444
HE LIVES IN AN ART GALLERY?

31:58.480 --> 32:00.448
I'M SO JELLY.
I SEE THAT.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.947
I'M NOT WINDOW SHOPPING.

32:01.980 --> 32:03.982
(toilet flushes in distance)
HELLO?

32:04.020 --> 32:06.045
(door opens)

32:06.090 --> 32:07.648
AH. HEY, OFFICERS.

32:07.690 --> 32:09.214
UH, SORRY ABOUT THE MESS.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.659
ARE YOU NICKY RADAR?

32:10.690 --> 32:13.079
UH, YES, I AM.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

32:13.130 --> 32:14.950
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT
A LOT OF TATTOOS THERE.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.594
YEP. GUILTY... OF FOLLOWING
THE TRENDS.

32:17.630 --> 32:19.188
WHO DOESN'T HAVE ONE THESE DAYS?

32:19.230 --> 32:21.289
CAN YOU TELL US WHERE YOU WERE
LAST NIGHT AT 11:00 P.M.?

32:21.340 --> 32:23.296
YEAH, I WAS HERE.
I HAD SOME FRIENDS OVER.

32:23.340 --> 32:26.309
WE WERE PLAYING SOME MUSIC,
HAD A BIT OF A JAM SESSION.

32:26.340 --> 32:28.604
THEY_CAN VOUCH FOR ME.
(radio chatter continues)

32:28.640 --> 32:30.608
HOW ABOUT THIS AFTERNOON,
AROUND 3:00?

32:30.640 --> 32:33.200
THIS AFTERNOON I WAS ACTUALLY
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET,

32:33.250 --> 32:36.742
GETTING MY HAIR CUT
WITH MY FRIEND STEWART.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.281
YOU GOT YOU HAIR CUT
TODAY?

32:38.320 --> 32:40.208
(whispers) YEAH.
I GOT, LIKE, 5 INCHES TAKEN OFF.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.751
IT FEELS WEIRD.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.348
YOUR BARBER
CAN VERIFY THIS?

32:43.390 --> 32:45.483
OH, YEAH. WE CAN HEAD OVER THERE
IF YOU WANT.

32:45.530 --> 32:48.226
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

32:48.260 --> 32:49.557
YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.522
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.266
(radio chatter continues)

32:54.300 --> 32:58.999
(horn honks in distance)

32:59.040 --> 33:00.735
IF HIS ALIBI HOLDS UP,
WE'VE LOST AN HOUR.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.203
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD HAVE GONE
AFTER BEAVERTAIL

33:02.240 --> 33:03.707
WHILE WE WERE
IN HIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

33:03.740 --> 33:06.675
(radio chatter continues)

33:06.710 --> 33:09.213
(sighs)
GREAT.

33:12.690 --> 33:15.056
DOV, LOOK.

33:15.090 --> 33:18.025
(siren wailing in distance)

33:31.370 --> 33:34.498
NICE TRY.
HEY, YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

33:34.540 --> 33:37.304
LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T IT, NICKY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33:37.340 --> 33:39.706
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME WITH US.

33:39.750 --> 33:41.547
YOU GUYS SERIOUS?

33:41.580 --> 33:43.810
OR YOU COULD SAVE US SOME TIME
AND SHOW US YOUR BUTT.

33:43.850 --> 33:46.648
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A TATTOO,
WE'LL LET YOU GO RIGHT NOW.

33:46.690 --> 33:49.579
(radio chatter continues)

33:49.620 --> 33:52.157
(bag thuds)

33:52.190 --> 33:54.192
(snickers)
THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT.

33:54.230 --> 33:55.720
THANK YOU, OFFICER PRICE.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.228
HANDS UP AGAINST THE WALL,
PLEASE.
(scoffs)

33:58.270 --> 33:59.521
NOW.

33:59.570 --> 34:02.562
(radio chatter continues)

34:03.840 --> 34:05.535
COME ON.

34:07.340 --> 34:10.275
(patting body)

34:17.720 --> 34:19.415
SORRY.

34:19.450 --> 34:21.714
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE IN HERE.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.716
(locker door opens)

34:23.760 --> 34:28.094
HOW'D IT GO WITH S.I.U.?

34:28.130 --> 34:29.324
YEAH. GREAT.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.329
I HAD TO REPEAT EVERY STEP
A DOZEN TIMES,

34:32.370 --> 34:35.294
BUT... IT'S FINE.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.228
WELL, THEY SAY
SHE MIGHT PULL THROUGH.

34:37.270 --> 34:45.109
YEAH. I GUESS
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.401
WHAT DO YOU WANT, MCNALLY?

34:49.550 --> 34:52.485
JUST TO SAY THANK YOU...

34:52.520 --> 34:54.784
FOR HAVING MY BACK.

34:54.820 --> 34:56.583
DOING YOUR JOB.

34:58.830 --> 35:03.255
YOU WERE JUST...
DOING YOUR JOB.

35:14.210 --> 35:17.270
(zipping boots)

35:21.680 --> 35:23.113
(exhales)

35:25.550 --> 35:28.519
(door buzzes in distance,
indistinct conversations)

35:31.390 --> 35:32.425
GAIL, WHAT'S UP?

35:32.460 --> 35:35.258
NOTHING. JUST GOING HOME.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.653
WITH THE URN?

35:36.700 --> 35:38.668
YEAH. I THOUGHT I WOULD
DROP HIM OFF FIRST.

35:38.700 --> 35:41.396
WHERE?
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE THE LAKE.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.169
YOU ARE SO SWEET.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.633
OH, DON'T BE STUPID.
IT'S NOT EVEN OUT OF THE WAY.

35:44.670 --> 35:46.433
IT'S THE SAME AS FLUSHING HIM
DOWN THE TOILET,

35:46.470 --> 35:50.474
ONLY IT'S A PRETTIER,
BIGGER TOILET. SO WHAT?

35:50.510 --> 35:52.307
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.318
(indistinct conversations
conﬁnue)

35:54.350 --> 35:56.272
(door buzzes in distance)

35:58.350 --> 35:59.908
CHLOE.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.178
GOOD WORK TODAY.

36:01.220 --> 36:04.587
THANKS. YOU, TOO.
RIGHT HERE.

36:04.630 --> 36:08.225
OKAY. UH...
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

36:08.260 --> 36:11.229
UH, WAIT. UM...

36:11.270 --> 36:14.467
IT FELT GOOD TODAY,
WORKING WITH YOU.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.764
IT FELT LIKE--I DON'T KNOW.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.429
I HAD A PARTNER
WHO APPRECIATED ME.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.370
YOU TREATED ME
LIKE A NORMAL COP.

36:22.410 --> 36:25.607
REALLY? 'CAUSE TODAY WAS
ONE OF THE MOST ABNORMAL DAYS

36:25.650 --> 36:26.639
I'VE EVER HAD.

36:26.680 --> 36:29.547
OH. OKAY. (Chuckles)

36:29.580 --> 36:30.842
IT WASN'T BAD.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.279
SO IT WAS GOOD?

36:32.320 --> 36:33.617
IT... WAS DIFFERENT.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.357
WELL, I THINK THAT WE MAKE
A GREAT TEAM.

36:36.390 --> 36:37.584
WE CAUGHT THE BAD GUY.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.622
THAT'S RIGHT.

36:39.660 --> 36:40.957
(chuckles)

36:40.990 --> 36:43.550
UM...

36:45.030 --> 36:46.918
DO YOU WANNA...
GET A DRINK?

36:46.970 --> 36:50.497
(sighs) OKAY.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.269
(lowered voice)
YOU'RE FRANK'S GODDAUGHTER.

36:52.310 --> 36:55.473
ALL RIGHT, I CAN'T DO
ANYTHING TO SCREW THAT UP.

36:55.510 --> 36:56.670
OKAY.

36:56.710 --> 36:58.541
PLUS RIGHT NOW MY EARS--
THEY NEED A REST.

36:58.580 --> 37:01.447
NO OFFENSE, BUT...
YOU TALK A LOT.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.778
OKAY.

37:03.820 --> 37:05.640
(chuckles)

37:05.690 --> 37:08.409
YOU KNOW WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR
IN THAT STATEMENT?

37:08.460 --> 37:09.950
A "NO."

37:09.990 --> 37:11.787
WELL, THE "NO" WAS IMPLIED.

37:11.830 --> 37:15.721
BUT NOT CLEARLY STATED.

37:15.760 --> 37:18.365
SEE YOU TOMORROW...
DOIVE.

37:24.070 --> 37:32.307
(man)
* ON MY OWN, I WOULD, I WOULD

37:32.350 --> 37:39.938
* ALL THE ROADS KEEP CLOSE,
KEEP CLOSE *
(needle buzzing)

37:39.990 --> 37:42.550
**

37:42.590 --> 37:45.423
ROY POWER.

37:45.460 --> 37:47.587
**

37:47.630 --> 37:49.689
WASHING AWAY IN THE WATER
IS BETTER

37:49.730 --> 37:52.392
THAN ROTTING AWAY
ON SOME SHELF.

37:52.430 --> 37:55.069
GAIL, AWAY FROM THE WIND.
AWAY FROM THE WIND.
CRAP.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.534
AH, ROY, I'M SORRY.

37:57.570 --> 37:58.935
WOW.

37:58.970 --> 38:02.076
THAT'S A LOT OF ASHES.

38:02.110 --> 38:03.509
I TAKE IT ROY WASN'T
A SMALL MAN.

38:07.710 --> 38:11.544
WHAT IF WASN'T...
JUST ROY IN THAT URN?

38:13.120 --> 38:15.486
WHAT IF WHEN
HIS SECOND WIFE DIED,

38:15.520 --> 38:18.819
SHE HAD HER ASHES
DUMPED IN WITH HIS

38:18.860 --> 38:20.555
SO THE TWO OF THEM
COULD BE BLENDED TOGETHER

38:20.590 --> 38:24.959
INTO A PILE OF...
INDISTINGUISHABLE DUST?

38:25.000 --> 38:27.366
THAT'S A WEIRD THOUGHT.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.539
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S WHAT
SOME PEOPLE WANT, YOU KNOW?
(sets down urn)

38:29.570 --> 38:32.801
THEY... WANNA BE BONDED
TOGETHER AS ONE UNIT,

38:32.840 --> 38:35.502
SHARING IN ALL OF
EACH OTHER'S UPS AND DOWNS.

38:35.540 --> 38:38.407
AND I KNOW IT'S CRAZY,
AND I WOULD NEVER--

38:38.450 --> 38:40.941
I WOULD NEVER ASK THAT
OF US, BUT IT...

38:40.980 --> 38:43.710
(sighs) THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
KIND OF ROMANTIC ABOUT IT.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.615
GAIL, JUST GIVE ME
THE DAMN DRINK.

38:45.650 --> 38:48.585
**

38:56.000 --> 38:58.992
(slurps)

39:01.000 --> 39:03.730
(gulps)

39:03.770 --> 39:05.362
LET IT GO DOWN.
JUST LET IT GO.
(mouth full) OH, GOD.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.002
SWALLOW IT.
LET IT TRAVEL.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.429
(coughs) THAT IS VILE.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.448
OHH.
THANK YOU.

39:11.480 --> 39:16.144

39:16.180 --> 39:19.013

39:24.020 --> 39:28.821

39:28.860 --> 39:31.988
(siren wailing in distance)

39:35.140 --> 39:38.701
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO TAKE YOU HOME?

39:38.740 --> 39:41.834
YEAH. I'M SURE.
DON'T WORRY.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.678
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME.

39:44.710 --> 39:47.577

40:02.500 --> 40:05.025
* WITH ME NOW?

40:05.070 --> 40:09.530
(engine starts)

40:22.480 --> 40:24.482

40:24.520 --> 40:26.715
IS THAT YOUR TALENT,
MCNALLY?

40:26.750 --> 40:27.887
POINTING OUT THE OBVIOUS.

40:27.920 --> 40:33.529
NO. I KNOW WHEN TO QUIT.

40:34.760 --> 40:37.228
THAT'S MY TALENT.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.023
I KNOW WHEN
THE ODDS ARE AGAINST ME

40:39.070 --> 40:42.039
AND WHEN TO WALK AWAY.

40:43.740 --> 40:45.731
GOOD NIGHT, SAM.

40:45.770 --> 40:47.203
