Great mustache, Mr. Selleck.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.867
Thanks.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.867
You can call me Tom.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.878

This is my room..

08:30.802 --> 08:32.304
Dad's been busy.

Uh, Gia, this is

08:33.680 --> 08:36.641
my little sister Michelle.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.979
Hi, Michelle.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.815
Do you mind if your

08:41.021 --> 08:43.815
sister and I talk?

[imitating Gia]

08:43.857 --> 08:46.734
Are you going to be

08:43.857 --> 08:46.734

Tell you what.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.075
If you leave us alone

08:54.117 --> 08:56.119
I'll give you a tic-tac.

Wow. A whole tic-tac

08:57.496 --> 09:01.082
just for me.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.755
Who's your friend?

09:09.924 --> 09:13.636
Listen, Tanner, what you

09:09.924 --> 09:13.636
did today was really low.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.097
You knew I liked Jamie,

09:13.678 --> 09:16.097
but you went for him anyway.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.932
I didn't know

09:16.139 --> 09:17.932
you liked him.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.351
Now you know.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.853
So you better call

09:19.393 --> 09:21.853
your little date off.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.897
No way.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.440
Tell him

09:23.938 --> 09:25.440
you can't make it.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.150
You're not feeling well.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.818
I feel fine.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.154
You won't if you don't

09:28.860 --> 09:31.154
call off your date.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.573
I'm not gonna do that.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.159
Fine.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.159
It's your funeral.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.309
What does that mean?

10:01.351 --> 10:03.978
Gia told everybody that

10:01.351 --> 10:03.978
you paid Jamie 20 bucks

10:04.020 --> 10:05.313
to go out with you.

It's all over school.

10:08.483 --> 10:11.111
Hey, Steph.

10:08.483 --> 10:11.111
I'll go out with you.

Steph, we got to talk.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.249
About this?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.960
Yeah. Everybody's

10:24.291 --> 10:26.960
been ragging on me.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.087
- Uh, who started this?

10:27.001 --> 10:29.087
- It's Gia.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.589
She said if we didn't

10:29.129 --> 10:30.589
call off our date

10:30.630 --> 10:32.424
she'd make

10:30.630 --> 10:32.424
my life miserable.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.842
Hey, Jamie,

10:32.466 --> 10:34.842
I was wondering..

10:34.884 --> 10:37.971
Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to

10:34.884 --> 10:37.971
disturb you at work.

10:40.807 --> 10:44.311
Listen, I'm really sorry

10:40.807 --> 10:44.311
about all of this.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.938
If you want to break the date,

10:44.352 --> 10:46.938
I understand.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.691
Maybe that's a good idea.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.403
It is?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.989
Sorry, Steph.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.241
Yeah, me, too.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.177
Come on, keep going.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.177

11:23.933 --> 11:26.060
Absolutely.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.060
This is a good idea.

You know what, it'll be

11:26.102 --> 11:28.522

Oh, you think so?

See? We're talking

11:30.064 --> 11:31.732

but, you know, going around

15:31.765 --> 15:34.100
changing everything

15:34.141 --> 15:35.894
that's just avoiding

15:34.141 --> 15:35.894
your feelings.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.219
Yeah, you know what

16:08.802 --> 16:10.219
getting back to normal

16:10.261 --> 16:12.305
sounds pretty good right

16:10.261 --> 16:12.305
about now.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.849
Hallelujah. Let's fry

16:12.346 --> 16:14.849
up these suckers.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.601
Alright, let's go.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.690
[laughing]

16:25.777 --> 16:28.529
Guys, check it out, somebody

16:25.777 --> 16:28.529
blew up Gia's report card

16:28.571 --> 16:30.156
and stuck it on the wall.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.158
Oh, that's terrible.

16:32.199 --> 16:34.327
Who would do

16:32.199 --> 16:34.327
such an awful thing?

16:38.581 --> 16:40.834
Steph...listen..

16:40.875 --> 16:43.085
I'm really sorry

16:40.875 --> 16:43.085
about yesterday.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.880
I'm not going to let

16:43.127 --> 16:45.880
Gia run my life.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.090
So, if it's okay with you

16:48.132 --> 16:50.050
are we still on

16:48.132 --> 16:50.050
for The Smash Club tonight?

16:51.135 --> 16:52.345
Yeah.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.805
Gee, this day's just

16:53.847 --> 16:55.139
getting better and better.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.557
[laughing]

16:58.142 --> 16:59.602
What's going on over there?

16:59.644 --> 17:02.981
A little thing I like

16:59.644 --> 17:02.981
to call sweet revenge.

17:04.691 --> 17:05.984
Alright, Steph.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.861
Yeah, well,

17:06.025 --> 17:07.861
she had it coming anyway.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.570
- See you tonight.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.570
- Tonight.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.660
Here comes Gia.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.288
Hey, Gia, what's zero

17:15.702 --> 17:19.288
plus zero plus zero?

17:19.330 --> 17:21.582
- I give up, Scott.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.582
- Your grade point average.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.001
[laughter]

17:28.548 --> 17:29.799
Who did this?

17:33.678 --> 17:35.763
You?

17:35.805 --> 17:38.265
You little..

17:38.307 --> 17:42.061
Now we know why you got

17:38.307 --> 17:42.061
an "F" in English.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.145
[bell rings]

17:43.187 --> 17:44.438
We got her good.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.357
Ruthless, Steph.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.357
I love it.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.114
So, Gia,

17:51.696 --> 17:54.114
looks like we're even.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.621
[slow instrumental music]

18:09.463 --> 18:11.716
[pop music]

18:11.758 --> 18:13.133
Nice haircut.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.133
Real nice haircut.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.510
Alright, everybody, good.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.510
Have some fun.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.804
Dance. That's good.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.804
Alright.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.472
That's good. Dance.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.472
Have a good time.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.017
Work up an appetite.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.017
Buy some food.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.604
You okay, Steph?

18:22.602 --> 18:24.604
You seem kind of quiet.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.064
I'm fine.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.441
Well, listen, guys,

18:26.105 --> 18:28.441
I gotta go tune up.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.234
Bye.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.365
I didn't think Gia would have

18:33.947 --> 18:36.365
the guts to show up tonight.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.627
Howdy ho, junior highsters.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.627
What can I do you for?

18:47.668 --> 18:49.629
Do something about

18:47.668 --> 18:49.629
this sticky table.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.131
Bring us the menus

18:49.670 --> 18:52.131
and try not to take forever.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.549
Okay.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.845
That's one cappuccino

18:55.635 --> 18:57.845
I'll be spitting in.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.559
Boy, I love this song.

19:03.601 --> 19:04.769
Scott, dance with me.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.646
I don't want to..

19:04.811 --> 19:06.646
Okay, cool.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.569
What's happening, Steph?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.569
Having fun?

19:13.611 --> 19:14.946
Not really.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.781
Oh, really?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.866
What's the matter?

19:18.908 --> 19:21.410
Well, a girl spread

19:18.908 --> 19:21.410
this awful rumor about me.

19:21.452 --> 19:22.787
Uh-huh, say no more.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.956
Same thing happened

19:22.829 --> 19:24.956
to me in junior high school.

19:24.998 --> 19:28.835
There was this ugly, awful,

19:24.998 --> 19:28.835
vicious rumor about me and a..

19:28.876 --> 19:30.210
...root perm.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.381
Well, I did something

19:32.254 --> 19:34.381
mean to get back at her

19:34.423 --> 19:37.010
but I think I really

19:34.423 --> 19:37.010
hurt her feelings.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.804
Oh, thought it'd make you

19:37.051 --> 19:39.804
feel good but it didn't, huh?

19:39.846 --> 19:43.099
Right. I thought revenge

19:39.846 --> 19:43.099
was supposed to be sweet.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.685
So how come I feel lousy?

19:45.726 --> 19:47.103
I hate to break it

19:45.726 --> 19:47.103
to you, kiddo

19:47.145 --> 19:48.813
but, uh, you've been cursed

19:48.855 --> 19:50.064
with a good heart.

19:51.607 --> 19:52.859
But, Uncle Jesse,

19:51.607 --> 19:52.859
this girl

19:52.900 --> 19:54.652
humiliated me in front

19:52.900 --> 19:54.652
of the whole school.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.155
Stephanie, what have

19:54.694 --> 19:57.155
I always told you?

19:57.196 --> 20:00.658
Never get a beauty

19:57.196 --> 20:00.658
school haircut?

20:00.700 --> 20:03.202
Well, yeah, but, no.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.202
No.

20:03.243 --> 20:04.912
I've always told you

20:03.243 --> 20:04.912
that it doesn't matter

20:04.954 --> 20:06.455
what people think about you.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.833
All that matters is what

20:06.497 --> 20:08.833
you think about yourself.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.301
Right now, I don't think

20:16.549 --> 20:19.301
that much of myself.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.723
Well, you listen to that

20:21.428 --> 20:23.723
good heart of yours.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.141
It'll tell you what to do.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.772
- Thanks, Uncle Jesse.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.772
- Oh, hug, hug, hug.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.947
What do you want?

20:39.989 --> 20:41.448
I came to apologize.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.450
Well, I don't need

20:41.490 --> 20:43.450
your apology.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.453
It wasn't that tragic.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.453
So what?

20:46.495 --> 20:49.415
You told the whole world

20:46.495 --> 20:49.415
I stink at school.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.042
It's not like

20:49.456 --> 20:51.042
it's any big secret.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.377
Maybe if you didn't

20:51.084 --> 20:53.377
ditch school all the time--

20:53.419 --> 20:55.004
Oh, what do you know?

20:55.046 --> 20:56.672
Nobody gives me a break.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.426
Just once, I'd like

20:57.882 --> 21:00.426
to have a teacher

21:00.467 --> 21:03.512
who hasn't heard of me

21:00.467 --> 21:03.512
before I got into the classroom.

21:03.554 --> 21:07.016
You know...it doesn't matter

21:03.554 --> 21:07.016
what other people think.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.726
It's what you think

21:07.058 --> 21:08.726
about yourself.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.228
Oh, what a valuable lesson.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.604
Thanks, Barney.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.400
I'm serious.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.400
You got a lot going for you.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.902
Like what?

21:17.944 --> 21:20.071
Well, you're a natural leader.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.488
Yeah, sure.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.990
And you're pretty.

21:23.032 --> 21:26.994
- Pretty stupid?

21:23.032 --> 21:26.994
- No, pretty, pretty.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.370
And..

21:28.412 --> 21:30.248
...you have a locker

21:28.412 --> 21:30.248
that actually opens.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.500
Tanner..

21:33.542 --> 21:34.877
...you're such a dweeb.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.383
Alright.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.383
Attention, everyone.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.219
Welcome to new band night

But don't get any ideas.

He's mine.

Yep.
