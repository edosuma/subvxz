00:18.707 --> 00:21.187
I'm sorry. There was nothing we could do.

00:22.917 --> 00:24.667
You couldn't let it go.

00:24.887 --> 00:27.177
Well, I hope you got what you wanted.

00:44.067 --> 00:46.597
Hey! Let me tell you guys something.

00:46.597 --> 00:50.927
This guy, this guy right here is so strong.

00:50.927 --> 00:54.157
He could take any one of you out in arm wrestling.

00:54.187 --> 00:55.707
Nah nah.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.557
Skips, Skips.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.647
I am your boss, and as your boss,

01:00.647 --> 01:03.417
I order you to arm wrestle me!

01:03.497 --> 01:07.487
Skips! Skips! Skips! Skips! Skips!

01:07.487 --> 01:10.437
Alright, alright, if you insist.

01:13.147 --> 01:15.587
What did I tell you, what did I tell you?

01:15.587 --> 01:17.817
Oh, oh, me, me!

01:21.017 --> 01:23.597
Set 'em up Skips, you can't take none of this.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.177
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:36.317 --> 01:38.867
Skips! Skips! Skips! Skips! Skips!

01:38.877 --> 01:39.887
Now me.

01:46.467 --> 01:47.847
C'mon Skips, set 'em up!

01:48.267 --> 01:51.017
Okay, I'll go easy on you.

01:51.637 --> 01:56.067
This is gonna be hilarious! Okay, ready, go!

01:56.427 --> 01:57.887
Haters gonna hate!

02:01.807 --> 02:05.047
Enough! We're going again, I wasn't ready.

02:05.047 --> 02:05.787
Maybe.

02:05.787 --> 02:08.787
Or maybe you're just getting weak in your old age, gramps.

02:08.787 --> 02:11.117
Okay, ready, go!

02:19.517 --> 02:22.157
Who's the strongest now!? Two in a row!

02:25.607 --> 02:27.107
That was awesome, man!

02:27.107 --> 02:30.427
It's all in the wrist. And also it's in the muscles.

02:38.517 --> 02:40.087
Hi Skips!

02:40.217 --> 02:43.847
You sure did a bang up job at arm wrestling yesterday.

02:43.847 --> 02:46.107
You were beating everyone!

02:46.157 --> 02:48.147
I didn't beat Rigby.

02:48.147 --> 02:51.277
Yes, he's quite the arm wrestler isn't he?

02:51.277 --> 02:53.307
I'm not the strongest anymore.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.807
Boulderdash!

02:54.817 --> 02:57.437
You're the strongest person I know.

02:57.437 --> 02:59.137
You were just having a bad day.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.277
You should go up to Rigby and demand a rematch.

03:02.347 --> 03:04.827
Then you'll see who the strongest is.

03:06.997 --> 03:08.547
Thanks, Pops.

03:15.007 --> 03:16.497
Here comes the power move!

03:19.347 --> 03:21.997
Dude, this is just like playing real guitar!

03:21.997 --> 03:23.437
Check this out!

03:26.607 --> 03:27.537
No!

03:27.537 --> 03:30.417
Dude, dodge the bottles! Up up down down left right left right!

03:32.257 --> 03:33.477
- Aww what? - Come on!

03:33.477 --> 03:36.937
Rigby! Me, you, rematch.

03:37.007 --> 03:39.557
- No. - I said I want a rematch!

03:39.557 --> 03:40.577
I'm busy.

03:44.337 --> 03:45.757
Dude, not cool.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.547
He'll get over it.

03:53.857 --> 03:54.937
Come in.

03:55.217 --> 03:58.147
Skips? Skips did you break their video game?

03:58.147 --> 04:00.317
Yes, yes he did I already told you!

04:00.317 --> 04:02.077
I want to hear it from him!

04:03.457 --> 04:04.287
Yeah.

04:04.357 --> 04:07.747
What!? Wow, uh, I'm sorry Skips, but,

04:07.747 --> 04:09.247
you're gonna have to pay for it.

04:10.167 --> 04:14.327
Oh I'll pay for it after Rigby gives me a rematch!

04:14.327 --> 04:16.716
What? That's what this is about?

04:16.716 --> 04:18.666
You wouldn't understand.

04:19.087 --> 04:21.547
Yeah I guess I wouldn't understand.

04:21.547 --> 04:24.087
I understand. You just want to lose again.

04:24.147 --> 04:25.127
Let's go.

04:28.377 --> 04:29.437
Set 'em up.

04:31.317 --> 04:32.087
Ready?

04:34.657 --> 04:35.357
Go!

04:37.057 --> 04:39.597
Make sure you pay him by the end of the week.

04:39.637 --> 04:41.537
- Yeah, I will. - What was that?

04:41.537 --> 04:45.887
I couldn't understand you. I don't speak second place.

04:45.947 --> 04:47.927
Make sure you pay him by the end of the week.

04:51.737 --> 04:55.397
Aww, yeah! McHooligan's, round two!

04:55.397 --> 04:56.577
Shotgun!

04:56.697 --> 04:58.787
I hope you guys got your drink tickets

04:58.787 --> 05:01.007
'coz the drinks are on me...

05:01.077 --> 05:03.287
up a dollar fifty value!

05:03.317 --> 05:06.967
Splendid, I can't wait to get an aguarita!

05:06.967 --> 05:09.237
I'm gonna get me an ice on the rocks, woo!

05:09.817 --> 05:11.577
Aww man, my drink tickets!

05:11.807 --> 05:14.157
Hey Mordecai, let's hustle!

05:14.157 --> 05:15.807
I'll be back in a sec, guys!

05:20.957 --> 05:23.767
Aww what, Skips? What are you doing?

05:24.857 --> 05:25.997
Uh, nothing.

05:28.487 --> 05:30.527
Uh, going through Rigby's stuff.

05:30.527 --> 05:32.847
Rigby, the strongest.

05:33.007 --> 05:35.257
There's gotta be a trick.

05:35.477 --> 05:38.907
Dude, Skips, I can't stand to see you like this.

05:39.187 --> 05:42.917
Listen. Don't tell him I told you this, but Rigby's been pranking you.

05:42.917 --> 05:43.837
What!?

05:45.497 --> 05:49.767
Two words, "Playco Armboy". Look it up.

05:54.267 --> 05:57.137
So, you think you can take on your old man?

05:59.097 --> 06:00.017
Easy!

06:02.727 --> 06:04.997
How to use Playco Armboy!

06:04.997 --> 06:07.017
First, put on Playco Armboy!

06:07.017 --> 06:09.537
Second, conceal Playco Armboy!

06:09.537 --> 06:12.267
Third, sign our legal Playco Armboy waver!

06:13.437 --> 06:14.997
Ready for round two, eh?

06:18.187 --> 06:20.987
That really hurt, son.

06:22.797 --> 06:25.507
A subsidiary of Yoshimoto Cybernetics!

06:48.667 --> 06:50.977
Hey Mordecai, what ever happened to Skips?

06:50.977 --> 06:53.667
Uh. He had stuff. To do.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.967
Probably resting his old man bones.

06:59.967 --> 07:02.877
Look who's back for thirds!

07:04.987 --> 07:06.527
Don't do it, Skips.

07:07.477 --> 07:09.987
Say goodnight, gramps.

07:35.087 --> 07:38.767
I'm sorry, Rigby. I'll make it up to you.

07:40.457 --> 07:43.837
Well well well. If it ain't old Skips.

07:54.837 --> 07:55.787
Death.

07:57.097 --> 07:58.607
You haven't changed a bit!

07:58.687 --> 08:00.757
So what's the occasion here, Skips?

08:00.757 --> 08:04.217
Is that your buddy there? Finally killed someone, eh?

08:04.267 --> 08:05.737
I want him back.

08:05.737 --> 08:07.627
Let's armwrestle for him.

08:07.627 --> 08:10.257
If I win, I keep him. If you win...

08:10.767 --> 08:12.877
you can take me instead.

08:13.897 --> 08:18.197
Big old Skips finally coming in for some good old fashion armwrestling, eh?

08:18.657 --> 08:19.767
'bout time.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.927
You've been dodging me for years.

08:21.927 --> 08:26.387
Now I get to beat you and take your immortal soul?

08:27.497 --> 08:28.157
Deal.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.636
I've been waiting for this day.

08:38.347 --> 08:39.397
Set 'em up.

08:46.357 --> 08:48.687
Ready?

08:50.557 --> 08:51.597
Go!

09:27.837 --> 09:30.767
Your soul is mine!

09:39.897 --> 09:42.027
Any last words, Skips?

09:42.857 --> 09:44.427
Two words!

09:45.067 --> 09:47.427
Playco Armboy!

09:58.337 --> 10:00.937
No, how is this possible!?

10:00.937 --> 10:03.177
Death, I won.

10:03.177 --> 10:06.117
Bring Rigby back and take a hike!

10:06.827 --> 10:09.397
Skips! Mark my words.

10:09.397 --> 10:13.607
Someday I will have your immortal soul!

10:28.067 --> 10:32.157
Listen Rigby, sorry for, you know, killing you back there.

10:32.157 --> 10:33.737
It was unprofessional.

10:35.077 --> 10:36.407
You know what?

10:36.677 --> 10:38.257
Water under the bridge.

10:38.257 --> 10:40.137
So you ended up cheating death, huh?

10:40.137 --> 10:42.187
I learned from the best.

10:45.167 --> 10:47.607
Seriously though, you shouldn't cheat.

10:47.607 --> 10:49.367
I only did it to save your life.

10:50.597 --> 10:53.107
- So, everybody thinks I'm dead? - Yep.

10:53.107 --> 10:55.437
Dude! We gotta prank 'em!

10:55.447 --> 10:59.227
Uh, y'know Rigby, I think I've had enough pranks for today.
