¶ ¶

00:07.558 --> 00:09.725
GLENN: Today, I'm
heading up the mountain.

00:09.827 --> 00:12.094
When I'm up in the mountains
travelling and hunting,

00:12.196 --> 00:14.563
I need a place to
get out of bad weather.

00:14.665 --> 00:18.934
I've built snow caves
before, but this winter,
I wanna try something new.

00:20.404 --> 00:23.338
This winter, I'm gonna
try to build an igloo.

00:24.008 --> 00:26.642
If I get caught in bad
weather, I'll have a
place to take shelter.

00:27.044 --> 00:30.312
Sometimes when you're up
on a mountain, you can just
walk into a total whiteout,

00:30.781 --> 00:32.948
not even see which
way to go to get down.

00:33.050 --> 00:35.350
Weather can be nice one
minute, and bad the next.

00:36.554 --> 00:43.258
(theme music plays)

01:00.044 --> 01:02.878
This right here is a ridge
that I spend a lot of time on.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.848
It'll be a good
place for an igloo.

01:06.050 --> 01:09.451
The caribou are gonna
start moving to the north,
and they often come right

01:09.553 --> 01:11.320
down this ridgeline.

01:11.422 --> 01:15.023
So if caribou do come through
here, I'll be well-positioned
with a shelter right here.

01:15.326 --> 01:16.458
Keep an eye on things.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.494
See if any animals
are moving through.

01:18.596 --> 01:20.562
This is the spot.

01:21.332 --> 01:23.866
I'm just gonna level
it out a little bit.

01:25.603 --> 01:30.172
Let's mark this out.

01:30.741 --> 01:32.508
That's about the size of me.

01:32.610 --> 01:35.978
That's the center of my new
home up here on the mountains.

01:36.313 --> 01:39.782
Now I just got to
make it come true.

01:40.985 --> 01:44.520
It's an interesting material
to work with, snow, because
it's very easy to cut.

01:44.622 --> 01:46.255
You can shape it
any way you want.

01:46.357 --> 01:47.956
You don't need any
power tools or anything.

01:48.058 --> 01:50.826
Like if I was building
with bricks or tile,
it would require a lot more

01:50.928 --> 01:56.098
in the way of tools.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.833
Okay, I like this block.

01:57.935 --> 01:59.902
It's a good size.

02:00.004 --> 02:06.241
About like this, but I'm
gonna need maybe 100, 150
of them to make my igloo.

02:06.343 --> 02:10.312
There, that's my
first block and this string
will help me put it in just

02:10.414 --> 02:13.715
the right place.

02:13.818 --> 02:18.387
Perfect, now I just need
to keep cutting blocks,
put them around in a ring,

02:18.489 --> 02:20.255
and spiral up.

02:20.357 --> 02:22.191
I like to do things precisely.

02:22.293 --> 02:23.392
I don't like to rush it.

02:23.494 --> 02:25.494
I like to take my
time, get it right.

02:25.863 --> 02:27.629
And this is the first
igloo I ever built.

02:27.731 --> 02:32.267
Every time I put on a new
block, it has to tip a little
bit in, so that at the end,

02:32.369 --> 02:33.836
they'll all meet at the top.

02:33.938 --> 02:38.140
The walls will become the
ceiling if I do it right.

02:38.609 --> 02:41.944
If I get it wrong, it
could all fall down.

02:42.780 --> 02:45.814
There, last block
in the first ring.

02:47.551 --> 02:50.452
The first ring, that's
like the foundation.

02:50.554 --> 02:52.754
Everything's gonna rest on it.

02:52.857 --> 02:56.592
Let's walk around this,
make sure all these blocks
are in good position.

02:56.694 --> 02:57.926
Looks pretty good.

02:58.028 --> 03:02.130
Look at that,
nice and circular.

03:02.333 --> 03:05.300
Look at that, isn't
that beautiful?

03:05.402 --> 03:07.436
A nice circle.

03:07.805 --> 03:10.639
Okay, time to keep building.

03:15.279 --> 03:18.647
JESSIE: The more time I spend
with these young dogs doing
things, interacting with them,

03:18.949 --> 03:22.050
I think thbetter for our
bond, our relationship.

03:28.792 --> 03:34.730
Try to pack as much in
there as I can get in there,
minimize my amount of trips

03:34.965 --> 03:38.934
getting the snow here.

03:40.704 --> 03:42.971
This right here is my
pump that's broken.

03:43.073 --> 03:46.808
Sediment was building up on
the bottom, and I was trying
to get it loosened up and

03:46.911 --> 03:50.012
twisting it, and I broke
the point that's down
there in the bottom.

03:50.681 --> 03:53.448
It's a problem I can't deal
with and fix right now.

03:53.550 --> 03:59.087
I've got to wait till it
all thaws out and I can
take a jack and jack that whole

03:59.189 --> 04:00.889
18 feet of pipe out.

04:01.025 --> 04:05.027
I just keep the snow melting
and keep as much of it on the
stove as I possibly can and

04:05.129 --> 04:08.030
try to keep ahead on water.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.066
I got 38 dogs right now.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.336
It requires me to have about
30 gallons of water a day.

04:15.072 --> 04:18.507
That's just how you start
your morning out, getting
the water into your dogs

04:18.776 --> 04:19.908
for the day's work.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.543
They have to stay
well hydrated.

04:21.679 --> 04:25.580
They're not gonna wanna
drink cold or clear water,
so we make like a soup and

04:25.683 --> 04:27.249
we call it
"Brothing" the dogs.

04:27.351 --> 04:30.018
The runs will be longer
and they need a little
bit of energy, too,

04:30.120 --> 04:32.054
for out on the trails.

04:33.424 --> 04:36.391
I don't take water for
granted, because I've had to
struggle to get it ever since

04:36.493 --> 04:39.494
I've been in Alaska,
not having electricity
or running water.

04:40.631 --> 04:43.598
No easy way around
getting water out here.

04:44.234 --> 04:47.970
It's just a real pain in the
neck way of getting water.

04:48.072 --> 04:52.407
I've had to do this before,
but, uh, kind of swore I
would never have to do it.

04:52.676 --> 04:55.811
And now that I've
had this water pump for
years, I'm pretty spoiled,

04:56.347 --> 05:00.615
and this is not a
very efficient way of
having water for me.

05:02.319 --> 05:06.455
So what I'm gonna do instead
is I'm gonna load up my dogs
and my dogsled and I'm gonna

05:06.557 --> 05:10.459
head downriver and, uh, go
put it in a nice waterhole.

05:15.099 --> 05:19.368
I'm gonna combine my
need for water, and
while I'm doing that,

05:19.470 --> 05:23.605
I'm gonna get the dogs
out for some exercise,
and I'm gonna go out and

05:23.707 --> 05:25.674
try some ice fishing.

05:25.776 --> 05:30.412
This isn't something I've done
before, but if this works out
good then I'm gonna be able to

05:30.514 --> 05:35.117
do this every year, extend
my months of opportunity
to have fresh food.

05:39.890 --> 05:43.291
Getting some water is
gonna be a really good
thing about this trip.

05:43.627 --> 05:46.995
I won't have to melt
no snow no more, and
once I got the hole in,

05:47.097 --> 05:50.098
I'll be able to maintain
it, and I won't have
to melt any snow for the

05:50.200 --> 05:52.734
rest of the winter.

05:53.003 --> 05:56.338
All right, I don't wanna
come home empty-handed.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.206
I don't wanna waste time.

05:58.308 --> 06:00.742
When I'm doing things
like this, I'm trying
to combine them,

06:00.944 --> 06:04.613
because it's an efficient
means of putting up some
food and getting some water.

06:05.549 --> 06:10.152
While I enjoy living simply,
I'm very realistic about all
the things that I got to do

06:10.254 --> 06:13.688
and how much I would like
them to be easier, that way
I could spend more time doing

06:13.791 --> 06:16.324
what I love
out on the trails.

06:22.533 --> 06:26.001
ANDY: I like an active
physical day and I
like a productive day.

06:26.236 --> 06:29.438
I need to feel like
I accomplished something
at the end of the day to

06:29.540 --> 06:31.873
feel good about myself.

06:42.119 --> 06:45.120
I've got a huge
project ahead of me
in the next two days.

06:45.222 --> 06:47.255
I'll be going to Eagle.

06:47.357 --> 06:51.093
I've got about 2,000 pounds
of brand new batteries
for my off-grid system.

06:52.296 --> 06:57.165
My off-grid system went
down right as winter set
on, and the road was closed,

06:57.601 --> 07:01.103
and it really screwed
me up, so I've had to burn
gasoline and a generator

07:01.205 --> 07:03.371
all winter long.

07:04.041 --> 07:08.076
It's a really exciting time
here for me, to be completely
self-sufficient again.

07:09.379 --> 07:13.148
<i>NARRATOR: Andy Bassich</i>
<i>relies mostly on solar and</i>
<i>wind to power his camp.</i>

07:13.684 --> 07:17.619
<i>Rebuilding his off-grid</i>
<i>system will allow him to</i>
<i>live independent of gasoline.</i>

07:18.388 --> 07:23.458
<i>But first, he must cross the</i>
<i>treacherous Yukon River to</i>
<i>retrieve his new battery bank</i>

07:23.560 --> 07:25.961
<i>and haul the heavy</i>
<i>load back to camp.</i>

07:32.069 --> 07:36.771
ANDY: I'm really excited to
finally get up to Eagle, be able
to haul these batteries down the

07:36.874 --> 07:41.977
Yukon River, which is gonna
be a major challenge for me
because the Yukon River is not

07:42.279 --> 07:45.313
a friendly place when you're
freighting heavy load.

07:53.590 --> 07:56.892
It's gonna take me two days
to haul these batteries down.

07:56.994 --> 08:00.762
I've got close to
$10,000 invested in this
whole new system now.

08:03.267 --> 08:06.168
When you're investing a
lot of money in something,
you want longevity.

08:06.803 --> 08:09.971
This new battery bank is
guaranteed for 25 to 30 years.

08:10.874 --> 08:14.042
I'm spending a bit
more money right now,
but in the long term,

08:14.144 --> 08:17.646
I don't expect to ever have to
buy another bank of batteries
the rest of my life out here.

08:26.190 --> 08:28.290
Ta-da!

08:29.660 --> 08:33.061
All that needs to go
downriver, 15 miles.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.803
So each one of these
batteries weighs about 80
pounds, there's 19 of them.

08:43.006 --> 08:46.341
The reason I'm doing this
now instead of waiting
until summer is, A,

08:46.443 --> 08:49.911
the sun's coming back
so I'm getting lots
and lots of free power,

08:50.147 --> 08:53.582
and it's really pissing me
off to have to use fossil
fuels to make my power.

08:54.017 --> 08:59.788
And B, if I was gonna
do this in the summertime,
I would have to carry them

08:59.890 --> 09:03.158
into a boat,
drive downriver, unload
them out of a boat,

09:03.694 --> 09:07.028
into a tractor,
drive the tractor or
trailer up to the hill,

09:07.130 --> 09:09.264
and then unload
them again into my shop.

09:09.499 --> 09:13.101
So the ironic thing about up
here is that it's actually
easier to freight and

09:13.203 --> 09:15.770
transport things in the winter
than it is in the summer.

09:19.076 --> 09:25.213
Time to strap her down
and head back to Dodge, at
an incredibly slow rate.

09:31.555 --> 09:34.656
The Yukon froze up a little
better this year than
it has for other years,

09:34.758 --> 09:36.491
so this is a good
year to freight.

09:36.627 --> 09:40.929
But with a delicate load like
this, it's always a challenge,
and all it takes is one bad

09:41.031 --> 09:44.232
bump, one bad battery,
and I'm dead in the water.

09:46.169 --> 09:49.471
Oh man, I don't know if I
can get this home like this.

09:50.374 --> 09:53.074
Oh, man, this thing's gonna
steer weird (bleep) now.

09:54.378 --> 09:56.044
All right.

09:58.949 --> 10:02.651
I wanna go really
slow and take it easy.

10:02.953 --> 10:04.919
What a mess.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.522
Slow and easy wins the race.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.905
Yay, one down, one to go.

10:29.346 --> 10:32.814
AGNES: For now, it's just
me and the girls taking
whatever comes our way.

10:33.116 --> 10:34.916
We have girl power.

10:42.125 --> 10:43.258
Ah.

10:46.463 --> 10:48.763
My last two pieces of wood.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.499
Chip's gone.

10:51.601 --> 10:55.804
Before he left, he got
us a whole bunch of real
big pile of firewood.

10:56.940 --> 10:59.908
And now that my firewood's
gone, this is all I have left.

11:00.677 --> 11:04.312
<i>NARRATOR: Agnes Hailstone's</i>
<i>husband, Chip, is serving a 15</i>
<i>month sentence in Anchorage.</i>

11:05.916 --> 11:09.751
<i>Throughout dark winter,</i>
<i>Agnes and her five daughters</i>
<i>have been forced to carry out</i>

11:09.853 --> 11:13.722
<i>crucial tasks, and</i>
<i>learn new skills to</i>

11:15.525 --> 11:20.161
-Usually, Chip's the one who
goes out and get all the wood,
and he tries to bring, um,

11:20.263 --> 11:22.897
a few loads back at a time.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.401
I'm gonna be getting wood
today and I just need enough
to keep the house, um,

11:26.503 --> 11:28.103
nice and warm.

11:28.205 --> 11:29.804
We don't usually
saw the trees down.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.240
It's gonna be a learning
experience for me.

11:36.747 --> 11:39.681
-You need help?
-Yeah, I was just gonna
go bring some woods in.

11:40.283 --> 11:44.519
If you don't mind, I think
I need to go get more wood
before Idi and them come.

11:44.888 --> 11:48.590
Idi and Edward are bringing
home their newborn baby and
they just want us to meet him.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.126
So they're gonna come
visit for a while.

11:51.228 --> 11:52.727
-All right.

11:52.829 --> 11:54.028
-Right on, so
you gonna follow?

11:54.131 --> 11:55.363
-Yeah.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.999
-My grandson's coming and
he's just a brand new baby.

11:58.101 --> 12:00.702
So, um, I'm gonna get
my house nice and warm.

12:00.937 --> 12:03.271
So I think I'm gonna
go out and go get wood.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.310
I'm glad Qutan
want to follow me.

12:09.413 --> 12:12.847
I don't really know if I'd
actually be brave enough
to go get wood by myself.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.588
I know how to spot wood,
I know how to limb them,
but I've actually never

12:20.690 --> 12:22.724
cut a tree down.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.058
-You've never, mom?

12:24.161 --> 12:27.028
-I have never really honestly
cut a tree down, sweetheart.

12:27.230 --> 12:29.998
So this is something we're
gonna go learn together.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.766
This is gonna be fun.

12:32.736 --> 12:35.670
I'm glad you're following.

12:46.149 --> 12:49.150
Today, Qutan and I are
gonna be getting some wood.

12:49.252 --> 12:53.455
I have a grand baby
coming in and, um, I want
to try to keep my grandson

12:53.557 --> 12:55.223
nice, comfortable, and warm.

12:55.325 --> 12:59.461
Idi just had a baby,
so she's bringing him to
meet the rest of the crew.

13:00.230 --> 13:04.065
Even though we're not wood
gatherers, I have a purpose
and I want my grandson to be

13:04.167 --> 13:06.568
warm and welcomed when
he comes to my house.

13:21.284 --> 13:24.052
These look a little
small but they look like
right next to the edge.

13:24.154 --> 13:26.387
Come look at these trees.

13:26.590 --> 13:30.124
This is what, this is what
we're looking for, right next
to the edge, mostly dead.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.127
So, I think, these two right
there will be just perfect.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.229
Shall we?

13:34.331 --> 13:35.563
-Yeah.

13:35.665 --> 13:38.600
-I get to go get wood with
Qutan and teach her something.

13:38.702 --> 13:43.972
I get to do, um, my own wood
gathering, and make it feel
more special heat for my

13:44.074 --> 13:48.142
grandson that's coming, and
besides that, uh, keeping
the house from freezing.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.512
So, it's gonna be
a real awesome day.

13:50.614 --> 13:53.248
I know it's gonna be hard
work but it's for the best.

13:53.850 --> 13:55.617
Ooh-wee.

13:55.719 --> 13:57.619
This is kind of a new
experience for me.

13:57.721 --> 14:01.756
Although I've been getting
wood all my life, I haven't
actually sawed a tree down.

14:02.058 --> 14:05.426
So, my first attempt,
hopefully it'll go good.

14:05.529 --> 14:11.099
I'm glad I brought Qutan to
back me up in case, uh, she
need to run the chainsaw

14:11.201 --> 14:14.302
because she has as much
experience as I do.

14:15.205 --> 14:16.804
You know what my plan is?

14:16.907 --> 14:20.008
I'm gonna go and I'm
gonna make a little
notch right here.

14:20.477 --> 14:24.112
Then I'm gonna saw it from
this side, and hopefully,
the tree will fall

14:24.214 --> 14:26.514
straight down this way.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.417
First thing I got to do
is start the chainsaw.

14:38.094 --> 14:43.831
Oh, whoa, come on.

14:49.940 --> 14:53.007
Let's try to give it a few
more pulls and hopefully
it will start up this time.

14:56.112 --> 15:01.482
(sputtering engine)

15:02.319 --> 15:04.018
(bleep)!

15:08.224 --> 15:10.258
This is horrible.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.168
AGNES: This is horrible.

15:26.543 --> 15:27.942
I've been pulling forever.

15:28.044 --> 15:32.013
It won't start because
that trip we took up here
made this chainsaw cold,

15:32.415 --> 15:35.917
and now it's having a hard
time starting, and then
I probably flooded it.

15:36.152 --> 15:40.521
It's like 28 below out here,
and every time you take any
kind of machinery out here,

15:40.624 --> 15:42.590
it's always, like,
hard to start.

15:43.293 --> 15:47.762
You have to pull, like,
20, 30 times before
it actually kicks in.

15:49.933 --> 15:51.032
Ready, Qutan?

15:51.134 --> 15:52.433
QUTAN: Yep.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.969
-Shall we keep on pulling?

15:55.472 --> 15:58.940
Ready?

16:00.477 --> 16:04.879
Lucky thing I have Qutan here
to help me with holding the
throttle for me while I pull.

16:04.981 --> 16:09.117
Like I say, even the littlest
person out here is a big help.

16:21.498 --> 16:23.464
-Whoa.

16:23.767 --> 16:28.403
Yes, woo, finally!

16:28.505 --> 16:31.572
I was starting to get worried.

16:32.342 --> 16:33.908
Watch out, Qutan.

16:38.348 --> 16:41.482
(screaming)

16:44.421 --> 16:47.188
-Timber!
-Woo-ho!

16:47.891 --> 16:49.590
Oh, my God!

16:49.693 --> 16:51.826
I actually sawed
my first tree down.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.762
A little scary at the
end, but I got it.

16:54.864 --> 16:56.698
I think I'm ready for
the rest of the forest.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.169
Ah, this is hard work.

17:11.081 --> 17:16.651
¶ ¶

17:17.721 --> 17:19.487
Woo!

17:19.723 --> 17:20.988
Whoa-ho-ho!

17:21.091 --> 17:23.224
We got it.

17:23.326 --> 17:24.992
Qutan's working on her tree.

17:25.095 --> 17:29.363
And with these three
trees, this should give us
at least a week of wood.

17:29.833 --> 17:30.898
Hey, Qutan.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.867
Yay!

17:33.136 --> 17:35.803
Oh, Qutan, right on!

17:36.272 --> 17:39.841
So now that you have your tree
knocked down, Qutan, all we
have to do now is just go limb

17:39.943 --> 17:42.243
the trees and go
bring the wood home.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.912
-All right.

17:51.855 --> 17:54.288
-You're a tough girl.

17:54.891 --> 17:58.192
You can stand the
cold and you can work
hard at the same time.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.994
Right on.

18:00.630 --> 18:02.930
Give me good company.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.368
You did a real big help today.

18:07.470 --> 18:09.504
Really appreciate
it, I thank you.

18:09.706 --> 18:10.705
That was fun, eh?

18:10.807 --> 18:11.672
-Uh-huh.

18:11.775 --> 18:13.174
-Cold but fun.

18:13.276 --> 18:15.076
Cold fun.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.944
Ready, Qutan?

18:17.213 --> 18:18.179
You gonna be warm enough?

18:18.281 --> 18:20.214
-Yep.

18:20.416 --> 18:24.685
-Okay, all we got to do
now is go home and make a
fire for Idi and her baby.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.829
Even with Chip being gone,
I get to learn something new.

18:34.931 --> 18:38.733
Usually, Chip's out here
sawing the wood and sawing the
trees down and I don't usually

18:38.835 --> 18:40.001
have to do that.

18:40.103 --> 18:43.704
It's good that I'm able to
know how to saw a tree down.

18:43.807 --> 18:48.109
Now, I appreciate his little
efforts a lot more because
this is actually hard work.

18:57.020 --> 18:59.287
GLENN: If you want to get
something the way you want
it, you usually have

18:59.389 --> 19:01.289
to do it yourself.

19:10.133 --> 19:12.633
Can't wait until I can
get inside of this thing.

19:13.636 --> 19:16.571
<i>NARRATOR: Glenn is building</i>
<i>an igloo on a nearby ridge.</i>

19:16.673 --> 19:21.042
<i>The structure will increase</i>
<i>his ability to harvest</i>
<i>caribou as they migrate,</i>

19:21.144 --> 19:23.477
<i>and provide a safe haven</i>
<i>from perilous weather.</i>

19:25.648 --> 19:26.681
-Whoa!

19:26.783 --> 19:31.886
Ah great, lost a
block in there.

19:33.656 --> 19:38.626
The higher the wall gets,
the more difficult it gets
to place blocks on the wall

19:38.728 --> 19:40.828
because there's
a steeper angle.

19:40.930 --> 19:45.066
As the wall curves
to become the ceiling,
the surface I'm laying the

19:45.168 --> 19:47.768
blocks on gets
steeper and steeper.

19:47.871 --> 19:50.371
They're starting
to slide in now.

19:50.473 --> 19:51.439
It's not good.

19:51.541 --> 19:53.841
I just lost a block.

19:54.577 --> 19:55.810
This one.

19:55.912 --> 19:57.478
Blocks are time
consuming to make.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.715
I can't afford to lose
blocks that way, so I've got
to have a different system.

20:05.221 --> 20:08.789
As the wall goes up
further and further, it
leans in more and more,

20:08.892 --> 20:11.893
because the wall is gradually
becoming my ceiling.

20:11.995 --> 20:15.162
So the principle of
the arch supports
all these blocks.

20:15.265 --> 20:18.432
But when I put a new
block on, there's nothing
holding it on this side,

20:18.534 --> 20:20.801
it has a tendency to slide in.

20:20.904 --> 20:25.973
So I'm bracing them
up with my shovel,
so I don't lose one.

20:26.075 --> 20:29.777
Set the shovel there,
that just supports it.

20:31.180 --> 20:33.414
The igloo's been
around for a long time.

20:33.516 --> 20:35.483
It must have been
thousands of years ago.

20:35.585 --> 20:38.552
Some of the earliest
people in the Arctic figured
out how to build a

20:38.655 --> 20:40.454
good house out of snow.

20:40.556 --> 20:43.958
And this is
basically the style of
construction they used.

20:44.060 --> 20:46.060
It's not that simple really.

20:46.162 --> 20:49.196
You don't just pile up snow
in a circle and have a house.

20:49.299 --> 20:51.465
There's a lot to it.

20:51.567 --> 20:54.869
The walls are getting higher.

20:54.971 --> 20:58.072
It's getting a little
tricky to get over them.

20:58.174 --> 21:01.142
My igloo needs a door.

21:01.244 --> 21:04.445
Gotta think about
where to put it.

21:04.814 --> 21:09.850
I need a door just to be
able to get in and out
while I'm building it.

21:09.953 --> 21:14.221
All I have to do
is start tunneling.

21:15.658 --> 21:16.958
The snow is really hard here.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.465
I want to keep the door small.

21:24.567 --> 21:26.834
I don't want a lot
of air coming in.

21:27.103 --> 21:30.104
Just big enough for
me to get through.

21:36.379 --> 21:37.812
This is great.

21:37.914 --> 21:40.481
My igloo's got a door,
the walls are going up.

21:40.583 --> 21:44.218
Pretty soon, I'll get
myself a ceiling on here,
and I'll be all set.

21:44.854 --> 21:48.189
With this igloo, I'll be able
to get good protection out
of the wind, out of the cold.

21:48.758 --> 21:51.158
I can't wait to spend
the night in here.

21:51.394 --> 21:55.029
I never did this
before, but so far, it's
working really well.

21:55.131 --> 21:57.865
I just gotta keep going.

22:01.637 --> 22:03.437
JESSIE: I try to
always keep fear in me.

22:03.539 --> 22:06.073
I think fear is something
that keeps you safe.

22:13.216 --> 22:15.916
This is gonna be a
time consuming job.

22:16.019 --> 22:20.488
It'll be a lot easier
if all I had to do is drill
through with the ice auger,

22:20.823 --> 22:24.392
but I need to make
a wide enough hole I can
dip the buckets in and

22:24.494 --> 22:27.161
easier to keep open.

22:27.263 --> 22:30.831
<i>NARRATOR: A broken water</i>
<i>pump has forced Jessie to melt</i>
<i>snow for fresh drinking water,</i>

22:31.667 --> 22:33.868

-That seems to
be a theme in my life,
things not being easy.

22:53.656 --> 22:55.856
Ah, there we go.

23:04.934 --> 23:06.267
Jesus.

23:16.579 --> 23:22.616
¶ ¶

23:24.120 --> 23:27.755
Oh man, the blades are getting
really dull on this from
drilling through that silt.

23:37.233 --> 23:42.269
¶ ¶

23:52.748 --> 23:56.884
I wanna get this nice
and wide so it's easier
for me to keep open.

24:00.857 --> 24:03.524
I'm gonna start taking
chunks out with the chainsaw.

24:15.605 --> 24:18.205
Ever since I've been
in Alaska, it's been
a struggle for me.

24:18.307 --> 24:21.242
You know, a lot of
things just not having
the right tools.

24:23.813 --> 24:27.448
As the years go by and
I get every little bit
of extra income I can,

24:27.550 --> 24:30.751
I invest it in my tools.

24:33.389 --> 24:36.590
All right, there we go.

24:38.828 --> 24:40.694
All right, this is
absolutely wonderful.

24:40.796 --> 24:43.030
I'm so excited about this.

24:43.132 --> 24:45.966
If I got fresh water,
I'm living a good life.

24:46.068 --> 24:49.370
Dogs are happy, I'm happy.

24:49.472 --> 24:51.539
Atta boys, hup, hup, hup.

24:52.175 --> 24:56.443
I'm gonna head downriver
and, uh, drill some
holes for ice fishing.

25:02.084 --> 25:06.287
-Part of living out here
is learning something new,
learning a new technology or a

25:06.389 --> 25:09.957
new skill, and then, uh,
utilizing that skill to
make my life better here.

25:13.296 --> 25:16.864
I am a happy young
boy right now.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.466
All right, let's get
one of these babies
in and on the rack.

25:20.770 --> 25:24.205
<i>NARRATOR: After hauling</i>
<i>his first load of batteries</i>
<i>safely across the Yukon,</i>

25:24.874 --> 25:27.441
<i>Andy is rebuilding</i>
<i>his off-grid system.</i>

25:27.543 --> 25:30.344
<i>This will allow him to power</i>
<i>his camp without gasoline.</i>

25:30.780 --> 25:33.881
<i>But every minute</i>
<i>without the new system</i>
<i>operating is costly.</i>

25:34.617 --> 25:36.050
ANDY: Here we go.

25:37.086 --> 25:39.019
The sun's coming back now.

25:39.121 --> 25:42.523
I'm getting into the time of
winter where I'm gaining six
minutes of daylight a day.

25:43.326 --> 25:47.761
So I want this system up
so I don't ever have to burn
gasoline again to make power

25:48.064 --> 25:49.763
until, maybe, November.

25:49.865 --> 25:53.534
So the quicker I can get
this in, the more I'm saving,
the more self-reliant I am.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.736
Okay.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.672
Nine on this row,
ten on the other.

25:59.508 --> 26:00.975
Halfway there.

26:01.110 --> 26:04.211
Now all I got to do is
drive all the way to Eagle,
load up another load,

26:04.313 --> 26:06.981
and do this all over again.

26:14.390 --> 26:17.358
One of the biggest
things for me is being
self-sufficient out here,

26:17.460 --> 26:21.362
being able to take care of
myself, and then utilizing the
resources around here to live

26:21.464 --> 26:23.397
the way I want to live.

26:23.499 --> 26:28.435
One of the things that really
irritates me is to have to use
gasoline for making power when

26:28.537 --> 26:31.639
I can get free power
from the sun or free
power from the wind.

26:33.309 --> 26:36.910
The batteries are a big
investment, but they're a long
term-investment and so getting

26:37.013 --> 26:40.481
them down here safely,
weighed pretty heavy
on my mind for a while.

26:44.420 --> 26:46.220
Back for round two.

26:47.490 --> 26:53.727
Hoping I can get the batteries
in the bank and start wiring
things together tonight so I

26:53.829 --> 26:57.197
can get off the jenny
and get on the off-grid.

26:59.735 --> 27:02.303
Had to move these
batteries four times now.

27:02.405 --> 27:05.339
On planes, off planes, on
trailers, off trailers.

27:05.808 --> 27:09.109
Lifting, carrying,
pushing, pulling, it's
nothing new out here.

27:13.683 --> 27:15.482
All right.

27:21.957 --> 27:25.192
I'm starting to
run into a bit of a whiteout
condition up ahead here.

27:25.795 --> 27:29.897
I'm gonna be driving
by braille for about
the next couple miles.

27:30.132 --> 27:33.167
Hopefully, this
snowstorm will let up.

27:33.636 --> 27:36.603
Oh man, what a mess.

27:38.374 --> 27:41.642
One thing I don't want
is I don't wanna fall
off this trail right now.

27:41.877 --> 27:46.113
With a heavy load like
this, if I get off in
the deep snow, that's it.

27:47.784 --> 27:50.751
ANDY: Oh man, what a mess.

27:53.823 --> 27:57.091
With a heavy load like
this if I get off in the
deep snow, that's it.

27:59.362 --> 28:02.563
Hopefully, this snowstorm
will let up on me.

28:03.900 --> 28:06.534
Gonna be smart about this.

28:07.670 --> 28:10.404
Come on, baby.

28:15.345 --> 28:16.711
I think I got it.

28:16.813 --> 28:18.346
Yeah, buddy.

28:18.448 --> 28:21.182
That had me nervous
for a few minutes.

28:22.852 --> 28:24.051
I made it.

28:24.153 --> 28:26.654
Now we'll see if the
batteries made it.

28:29.058 --> 28:32.727
This battery bank should
last me the rest of my life
down here at Calico Bluff if

28:32.829 --> 28:34.262
everything goes well.

28:34.364 --> 28:37.865
Alaska's a harsh condition,
doesn't matter if
it's summer or winter, so,

28:37.967 --> 28:40.635
the things that you use up
here get pretty hard use.

28:40.737 --> 28:43.504
Mm, man it's getting heavy.

28:45.008 --> 28:47.875
I don't know if the
batteries are getting heavier
or I'm getting weaker.

28:49.913 --> 28:51.979
Whew, I've got all
the batteries here.

28:52.081 --> 28:53.948
The hard work's done,
the physical part.

28:54.050 --> 28:56.417
Now comes the smart part.

28:56.519 --> 29:01.289
The next big step is to
get everything connected
up and then, hopefully,

29:01.391 --> 29:03.257
I'll be ready to go.

29:08.298 --> 29:11.132
JESSIE: The minute you start
thinking you know everything
out there is the minute that

29:11.234 --> 29:14.268
you end up making a
very critical mistake.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.739
Haw, haw.

29:18.841 --> 29:20.107
Straight up, straight
up, straight up.

29:20.209 --> 29:22.343
Straight ahead,
straight ahead.

29:25.515 --> 29:27.481
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:27.584 --> 29:29.650
Stay, good boys,
stay right there.

29:30.086 --> 29:32.987
I think, I'm just
gonna set all three of
my lines in this area,

29:33.089 --> 29:35.656
because I know this is
gonna be a productive area.

29:35.758 --> 29:38.759
<i>NARRATOR: After securing</i>
<i>vital drinking water for</i>
<i>himself and his sled dogs,</i>

29:39.462 --> 29:43.864
<i>Jessie is now searching for</i>
<i>another precious resource</i>
<i>under the ice that will help</i>

29:43.967 --> 29:46.400
<i>them survive the</i>
<i>remainder of winter.</i>

29:46.703 --> 29:49.103
-I'm really looking forward
to catching some Burbot.

29:49.205 --> 29:50.304
The fish are here, you know?

29:50.406 --> 29:52.840
We just got to set the
holes and set the lines.

29:52.942 --> 29:56.310
I'm not quite sure
how thick the ice is gonna
be, but I hope it's not any

29:56.412 --> 29:58.412
thicker than this.

30:01.951 --> 30:03.718
Let it warm up.

30:03.820 --> 30:05.119
All right, got it running.

30:05.221 --> 30:08.189
I'm gonna punch
my first hole in.

30:11.728 --> 30:15.363
Some people might say I'm
a poor man, but I think I'm
a rich man living my dream,

30:16.032 --> 30:20.368
working with my dogs, and
catching food from the river,
it's a dream come true to me.

30:23.106 --> 30:25.272
I've never fished for
Burbot under the ice.

30:25.375 --> 30:30.044
Once I figure this out, I can
go run these lines the rest of
the spring until the ice goes

30:30.146 --> 30:33.080
out and I can provide
myself with some fresh food.

30:42.859 --> 30:48.362
¶ ¶

30:50.199 --> 30:54.235
I'm kind of learning
something new here, so I'm
excited to see how this goes.

30:55.438 --> 30:57.038
My sinker's going down.

30:57.140 --> 31:00.841
Burbot are a bottom feeding
fish, so this will go all
the way down to the bottom,

31:00.943 --> 31:02.543
where they're travelling at.

31:02.645 --> 31:05.546
I'm gonna set myself in
a few lines out here.

31:05.915 --> 31:09.750
That way, I maximize
my opportunity of
getting something.

31:14.123 --> 31:18.092
I want to use the snow to
insulate it from freezing
over too hard tonight.

31:19.595 --> 31:22.630
So with the clear
skies, the temperatures
are bound to drop.

31:28.571 --> 31:31.505
Got another hole ready
to set another line.

31:31.741 --> 31:33.741
Here, it hit the bottom.

31:33.843 --> 31:35.810
I got two lines set now.

31:35.912 --> 31:38.245
I got one more to put in.

31:43.352 --> 31:44.885
And that's gonna
sit overnight.

31:44.987 --> 31:47.888
I hope I can come
back here tomorrow and
have some fresh fish.

31:47.990 --> 31:51.559
Dogs have been being
awesome while I've been
doing all this work.

31:51.661 --> 31:52.893
I'm pretty proud of them.

31:52.995 --> 31:56.230
I'm pretty happy that we got
our goal accomplished here.

31:56.432 --> 31:59.967
Now we can just let them
sit and see how it goes.

32:00.303 --> 32:01.469
Yeah, boys.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.337
Good job, guys.

32:03.439 --> 32:05.573
All right, straight
up, straight up.

32:06.209 --> 32:09.243
It's been a hard day's work
getting all my stuff set in.

32:10.680 --> 32:14.482
Come back here in the morning
and hopefully, I'll be frying
up some fish tomorrow night.

32:22.291 --> 32:25.960
GLENN: If you wanna
live where it's this cold,
you've got to learn to use it

32:26.062 --> 32:27.695
to your advantage.

32:27.797 --> 32:30.131
And I do every day.

32:33.836 --> 32:36.470
It's windy up here this
afternoon and it's cold.

32:37.173 --> 32:38.672
But that's what
the igloo's for.

32:38.775 --> 32:41.509
It's gonna protect me from
the wind and from the cold.

32:41.611 --> 32:44.812
This snow is good insulation.

32:49.085 --> 32:51.685
My spiral is
tightening up here.

32:51.788 --> 32:54.588
I'm getting close to the top.

33:23.553 --> 33:26.253
I'm just gonna try and
get this one in here.

33:26.355 --> 33:29.223
It's tricky, the angles
are changing a lot.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.091
The spiral's tightening up.

33:31.194 --> 33:34.562
Everything feels like
it's about to come down.

33:39.669 --> 33:41.802
It's definitely
getting harder.

33:51.214 --> 33:53.314
Real tricky working alone.

33:53.416 --> 33:56.350
If I had something
to help me hold it,
it'd be a lot easier.

33:56.452 --> 33:59.887
But I gotta do
this on my own.

34:04.360 --> 34:07.695
Hey, this is
looking pretty good.

34:08.331 --> 34:12.333
I just got a little
skylight here I gotta fill
in, and then I'll be done.

34:12.435 --> 34:16.003
Once I get it
completely closed in, it
should be really secure.

34:23.946 --> 34:27.381
If I mess up, it all
comes crashing down.

34:37.260 --> 34:42.696
¶ ¶

34:52.508 --> 34:56.510
¶ ¶

34:56.746 --> 34:58.746
There, the last block.

34:58.848 --> 35:00.214
It's in place.

35:00.316 --> 35:01.749
My igloo's all closed in.

35:01.851 --> 35:03.751
This is incredible.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.819
The basic structure
is complete.

35:05.922 --> 35:10.858
Now, I just have to chink
the cracks between the blocks
and then finish up the door.

35:16.666 --> 35:20.834
-Some people just see
a white expanse of frozen
nothingness and I see a

35:20.937 --> 35:22.937
land of opportunity out here.

35:35.584 --> 35:38.419
Hike, whoa, stay boys.

35:40.723 --> 35:42.022
It's another day out here.

35:42.158 --> 35:44.758
Ready to check these
holes and hopefully
they were productive.

35:44.860 --> 35:48.963
Hoping that I
caught something.

35:49.065 --> 35:52.333
All right, now I got to
pull the line all the way out
and hope there's something

35:52.435 --> 35:54.535
on the other end of it.

35:58.941 --> 36:03.344
I have a real sense of pride
in living this way and, uh,
being able to provide myself

36:03.446 --> 36:05.813
with food, not having
to go to a store.

36:05.915 --> 36:09.483
It really makes sense
for me to be able to get the
kind of food that I like off

36:09.585 --> 36:12.086
the land and
save money that way.

36:13.756 --> 36:14.788
Oh, I feel something.

36:14.890 --> 36:16.590
It's got something for sure.

36:26.335 --> 36:27.601
Oh (bleep).

36:29.338 --> 36:32.305
JESSIE: Oh (bleep), damn it.

36:34.042 --> 36:36.209
Guess a line broke.

36:36.311 --> 36:37.510
It's no good.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.279
I feel terrible.

36:39.381 --> 36:43.049
I think I had fish
on there and I lost
them, and that's sad.

36:43.585 --> 36:47.487
This is something new
for me, and I'll take that
experience and I'll fix it.

36:57.065 --> 36:59.165
We might have something here.

36:59.267 --> 37:02.469
Yeah, all right man, awesome.

37:02.738 --> 37:04.204
That's a nice fish.

37:04.306 --> 37:05.572
How exciting.

37:05.674 --> 37:06.906
Oh, boy!

37:07.008 --> 37:08.475
We got two, yes!

37:08.577 --> 37:09.909
Oh, that's so great.

37:10.011 --> 37:12.178
Yeah guys, we got some fish.

37:12.614 --> 37:15.315
That's awesome.

37:24.226 --> 37:27.494
Well, I'm thankful that
I already have two fish.

37:27.596 --> 37:32.632
I'm hoping to catch more.

37:32.734 --> 37:34.167
I think I got something.

37:34.269 --> 37:36.536
Feels heavier than
the rock bag.

37:38.106 --> 37:41.174
Yup, I definitely
got something.

37:42.244 --> 37:44.043
It's moving, it's a big one.

37:44.146 --> 37:45.512
No, it is, it is a big one.

37:45.614 --> 37:49.949
Yeah, boom, look at that guy!

37:51.520 --> 37:53.753
That is so awesome.

37:53.855 --> 37:56.456
Oh, yes.

37:57.058 --> 38:01.661
I got myself three fish,
gifted to me by the river, and
I'll take one of those fish

38:01.763 --> 38:03.963
and I'll cook it up, and it'll
feed me for a couple days.

38:04.065 --> 38:08.802
And I can keep these holes
in and I can use this
to provide daily food.

38:10.372 --> 38:15.475
Time to pack up and head
back home, and get these
cleaned up and cooked up.

38:19.448 --> 38:21.714
That's some nice
meat right there.

38:21.817 --> 38:23.850
Killed a lot of birds
with one stone here.

38:23.952 --> 38:28.755
I've got water and I've
got a sustainable way for the
rest of the spring to provide

38:28.857 --> 38:31.991
myself with fresh food, fish.

38:32.194 --> 38:35.361
One of my favorite things,
especially these Burbot.

38:35.464 --> 38:37.864
This is a delicacy.

38:40.001 --> 38:42.368
Pretty much just takes
life to make life.

38:42.471 --> 38:47.273
You know, it gave its
life over and it sustains
me, and gives me energy,

38:47.776 --> 38:50.009
and keeps me out on the trail.

38:51.112 --> 38:53.713
So I'm thankful for that.

38:58.119 --> 39:00.453
Mm, that is so good.

39:01.223 --> 39:02.755
Mm.

39:02.891 --> 39:07.227
And that's what I count
on to keep me healthy, is
eating good food like this.

39:07.929 --> 39:11.664
They call it poor man's
lobster, but to me it's a
rich man's diet right here.

39:11.900 --> 39:14.367
There ain't nothing
poor about this fish.

39:17.172 --> 39:18.972
GLENN: The dangers
are insidious.

39:19.708 --> 39:22.075
The most dangerous things,
you won't see coming.

39:22.911 --> 39:25.445
You're not gonna know
what the most dangerous
thing is until it happens.

39:32.454 --> 39:36.856
I had to spend a
lot of energy building this
igloo, but it was worth it.

39:37.058 --> 39:40.527
You've got to figure out what
it is you really wanna do,
and once you figure it out,

39:40.629 --> 39:43.263
it's amazing how much
energy you'll have to do it.

39:43.565 --> 39:47.267
I just took what was right
here on the ground, and built
a shelter that's protecting me

39:47.369 --> 39:51.237
from the wind, insulating,
100% made out of snow.

39:52.908 --> 39:57.043
You can't get any more
natural, you can't get any
more eco-friendly, than this.

40:00.382 --> 40:05.184
All right, my igloo's
finished, time to move in.

40:06.354 --> 40:10.056
I'll put in my bedding,
put in my lamp, cook up some
dinner, and call it a night.

40:13.929 --> 40:16.563
Hey, there's a caribou.

40:18.033 --> 40:23.102
This time of year, they often
start moving back this way,
head along these ridgelines.

40:23.672 --> 40:25.405
This is a good spot.

40:25.507 --> 40:28.775
That may be just the first
of many, we can hope.

40:35.216 --> 40:38.418
Got a nice chunk
of moose meat here.

40:41.022 --> 40:42.689
Nice.

40:44.960 --> 40:47.427
That's gonna taste good.

40:47.829 --> 40:49.696
I can smell the
moose meat cooking.

40:49.798 --> 40:52.432
I can smell the moose
fat burning in my lamp.

40:54.636 --> 40:57.537
I've built a lot
of different kind of shelters,
and I think this one here just

40:57.639 --> 40:59.772
might be my favorite.

41:00.075 --> 41:01.874
Gravity is holding
this all together.

41:01.977 --> 41:04.777
All the blocks are leaning
against each other.

41:08.450 --> 41:10.516
Mm, that smells good.

41:10.719 --> 41:14.153
This is a moose I got
just a couple miles from
here, down by the lake.

41:20.228 --> 41:23.162
Mm, oh, that hot
meat is so good.

41:25.100 --> 41:28.167
Nothing like a piece
of meat cooked on fat
from the same animal.

41:29.170 --> 41:31.571
Not too many people cook
their meat that way anymore.

41:38.947 --> 41:40.980
Wow, what a night!

41:41.082 --> 41:44.250
Oh, the Auroras are out.

41:45.086 --> 41:49.789
To be up here with my igloo
on the mountaintop under
a sky like this, amazing.

41:53.962 --> 41:56.896
When you're up on a mountain,
weather can change fast.

41:58.233 --> 42:01.968
But with an igloo,
I got a place to go.

42:02.070 --> 42:04.337
Shelter from the storm.

42:09.310 --> 42:13.546
ANDY: Everything out here is
all about planning and if you
don't plan well and if you

42:13.648 --> 42:17.517
forget a step or miss a
step, a lot of times it
comes back to bite you.

42:25.627 --> 42:30.563
Just doing my final check on
all the terminals and then
I just have to connect my

42:30.665 --> 42:33.232
batteries to the
distribution panel.

42:34.469 --> 42:37.470
<i>NARRATOR: With</i>
<i>his new battery bank in place,</i>
<i>Andy will now attempt to</i>

42:37.572 --> 42:39.772
<i>get his off-grid</i>
<i>system up and running.</i>

42:40.408 --> 42:44.177
<i>If successful, he'll</i>
<i>be able to thrive along</i>
<i>the Yukon River without</i>

42:44.279 --> 42:46.079
<i>relying on gasoline.</i>

42:46.614 --> 42:49.882
ANDY: I got a nice sunny
day, so I'll know whether
everything's working or not,

42:50.151 --> 42:53.486
'cause the sun's hitting the
solar panels really well.

42:53.722 --> 42:58.991
The big thing to do now is
turn this breaker on and this
is either gonna fry everything

42:59.094 --> 43:01.360
or I'll be okay.

43:06.534 --> 43:08.334
Uh-hmm, I like that.

43:08.436 --> 43:10.336
Ooh, I like that.

43:10.438 --> 43:12.038
The whole system's
up and running.

43:12.140 --> 43:16.008
I'm pretty much done with
all of the configurations.

43:16.111 --> 43:20.046
I'm gonna put as much energy
back into the batteries
with the sun today.

43:20.148 --> 43:24.984
I've got a bright sunny day
outside, and the solar panels
were pumping out a lot of

43:25.086 --> 43:26.652
energy right now.

43:26.788 --> 43:31.190
Once it gets dark tonight,
I'm gonna get the batteries up
to full operation and

43:31.292 --> 43:34.927
then I should be,
uh, fully operational
from that point in time.

43:42.036 --> 43:44.871
All right, the big moment.

43:44.973 --> 43:47.740
Convert everything
to battery power.

43:49.878 --> 43:51.677
Yeah!

43:51.780 --> 43:53.146
Yee-haw.

43:53.248 --> 43:55.014
I got juice in here.

43:55.116 --> 43:57.316
Look at that.

43:57.418 --> 44:00.319
That's all coming from
my batteries and the sun.

44:01.356 --> 44:03.089
I'm feeling good.

44:03.224 --> 44:07.660
This was a big job, a lot of,
uh, a lot of work to get all
of these batteries down here.

44:08.029 --> 44:11.831
A lot of time and effort and
money invested in this, but
this is gonna be good now for

44:11.933 --> 44:14.634
the next 15, 20 years.

44:14.903 --> 44:16.903
Probably the rest of my
life here at Calico Bluff.

44:17.005 --> 44:19.906
The whole reason I live out
here is to be independent
and self-reliant,

44:20.675 --> 44:24.510
and I'm another step
closer to that now for
the rest of my life here.

44:31.953 --> 44:34.187
AGNES: It was a hard
day's work, but it
was well worth it.

44:34.656 --> 44:38.057
It's nice to see my
family with a happy face.

44:47.969 --> 44:50.837
¶ ¶

44:50.939 --> 44:52.438
It's gonna be a nice evening.

44:52.574 --> 44:57.743
We got the fire going, we
got some fish thawing, and,
uh, Idi should be coming

44:57.979 --> 44:59.612
in soon with her baby.

44:59.714 --> 45:03.449
It's pretty exciting
watching one of my daughters
raise their own baby.

45:03.718 --> 45:05.751
And it's, um, she's
doing a pretty good job.

45:06.321 --> 45:09.021
Today's hard work
pays off in the end.

45:09.123 --> 45:13.226
It's nice and comfortable
and warm in here, and I
can't wait to hold the baby.

45:16.231 --> 45:20.633
Right now I am just, uh,
getting some of Idi's
favorite fish ready.

45:20.869 --> 45:24.637
She loves to eat frozen
fish and seal oil,
and carrots, and, uh,

45:24.739 --> 45:27.573
Qutan's helping me with
cutting up all the apples.

45:27.909 --> 45:30.776
We love apples to go
with our seal oil.

45:30.879 --> 45:33.980
I'm so happy you followed
me out there to go get wood.

45:34.482 --> 45:36.682
QUTAN: Yeah, it was fun.

45:38.453 --> 45:41.020
-Whew.
-Oh, Idi.
-Hi.

45:41.122 --> 45:42.989
-Hey.
-My tote.

45:44.259 --> 45:47.493
-How are you, Edward?
-Hi, I miss you guys.
-Hey, Edward.

45:48.162 --> 45:51.364
-My sister, how are you?
-Stepped out of a long flight.
-I bet.

45:51.666 --> 45:52.632
Over an hour?

45:52.767 --> 45:55.034
-Yeah, stopping off our
both villages before.

45:55.136 --> 45:58.037
-Baby!
-Oh, my goodness!
-Oh, so big.

45:58.573 --> 46:01.440
-Is Mama keeping you warm?

46:03.077 --> 46:05.211
So handsome, one baby.

46:05.313 --> 46:06.812
-Very heavy baby, Idi.

46:06.915 --> 46:08.347
Oh, you're waking up.

46:08.449 --> 46:09.982
Look you're in Noorvik, son.

46:10.084 --> 46:13.886
-(inaudible) grandma.
-Three and a half months now.
-Three and a half months.

46:13.988 --> 46:16.555
-25 pounds.
-25 pounds.

46:17.125 --> 46:17.924
Come on.

46:18.026 --> 46:20.459
-You go to your
Auntie Tinmiaq.

46:20.561 --> 46:22.128
Wake up to Auntie Ting.

46:22.230 --> 46:24.063
-Oh, man, look at
your eyeballs, boy.

46:24.165 --> 46:25.131
Hi.

46:25.233 --> 46:27.166
-Oh, wait, Carolyn's
his godmother.

46:27.268 --> 46:28.401
-Big, heavy boy.

46:28.503 --> 46:29.535
CAROLYN: Oh,
I'm his godmother.

46:29.637 --> 46:32.838
Huh?

46:33.474 --> 46:36.809
AGNES: It was a hard day of
work, but yet, it paid off.

46:36.911 --> 46:39.145
I'm able to hold my grandson.

46:39.247 --> 46:40.913
The house is nice and warm.

46:41.015 --> 46:42.581
We got the trout
ready for you.

46:42.684 --> 46:44.784
We knew you was gonna be
hungry when you get here.

46:45.086 --> 46:46.519
-This is like the best
thing to come home to.

46:46.621 --> 46:48.220
This is amazing.

46:48.323 --> 46:49.388
-My kids are happy.

46:49.490 --> 46:51.691
I just have nothing
to worry about.

46:51.793 --> 46:53.225
Life can't get any
better than that.

46:53.328 --> 46:55.995
Right, Weedles?
