00:39.250 --> 00:41.250
[muffled music playing]

00:45.208 --> 00:46.708
[music continues]

00:47.875 --> 00:50.791
- [screeches]
- [chuckles] I got you this time.

00:52.666 --> 00:53.750
- [screeches]
- [grunts]

00:53.833 --> 00:56.250
- [shouts]
- [Wrecker] What-- [groans]

00:56.333 --> 00:59.916
[laughs]
Now you owe me two cartons of Mantell Mix.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Not so fast.
One more game. Double or nothing.

01:03.083 --> 01:05.875
Hey! Quit running up the power bill.

01:05.958 --> 01:09.125
It's time to get to work.
I got another job for you.

01:09.708 --> 01:12.333
Hunter and Echo aren't back
from the other mission yet.

01:12.416 --> 01:17.375
I would not call transporting 50 cases
of nerf nuggets a "mission."

01:17.458 --> 01:19.708
Nor is it a proper use of our skill set.

01:19.791 --> 01:24.125
Yeah, well, your skill set
will come in real useful on this one.

01:24.625 --> 01:28.333
Especially you, Muscles.
You're gonna be my security crew.

01:29.208 --> 01:32.541
We will require
a more detailed briefing than that.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.666
No time. The shuttle's waiting.

01:36.541 --> 01:37.666
Maybe it'll be fun.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.416
[grunts] Works for me.

01:41.583 --> 01:42.875
[sighs]

01:53.916 --> 01:55.916
[people chattering]

02:01.375 --> 02:03.750
[Tech] I am beginning
to understand the need

02:03.833 --> 02:05.833
for added security in a place like this.

02:06.416 --> 02:09.041
Safa Toma can be
a little rough around the edges

02:09.125 --> 02:10.791
if you don't know what you're doing.

02:10.875 --> 02:14.208
But lucky for us, I know my way around.

02:14.291 --> 02:17.416
And if things get dicey,
that's where you come in.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.458
- [crowd cheering]
- [speeders racing]

02:22.916 --> 02:24.916
[cheering continues]

02:32.833 --> 02:34.166
Whoa!

02:34.250 --> 02:36.250
It's called Riot Racing.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.750
Wow! Did you see that?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.458
[Tech] It appears anything goes out there.

02:48.541 --> 02:50.083
[announcer on PA] <i>The smoke's cleared,</i>

02:50.166 --> 02:51.916
<i>and TAY-0's taken the lead</i>
<i>from "Hyper" Rod!</i>

02:53.875 --> 02:56.125
That's my new racer, TAY-0.

02:56.708 --> 03:00.666
He's a real ringer.
He's gonna make me a lot of dough.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.458
[announcer] <i>And TAY-0 wins!</i>

03:05.125 --> 03:06.333
- <i>TAY-0 wins!</i>
- Follow me.

03:07.333 --> 03:10.791
[crowd grumbling, cheering]

03:18.875 --> 03:21.500
Greetings, Boss Lady.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.583
Did you enjoy the show?

03:23.666 --> 03:26.041
It was impressive, wasn't it?
Did you see me out there?

03:26.125 --> 03:28.375
Your ringer is a droid?

03:28.458 --> 03:31.208
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You have a problem with droids, human?

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
You think you can make the split-second
calculation to win out there?

03:36.583 --> 03:38.250
You want to challenge TAY-0?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.500
I do not have enough information about
this sport to determine that at this time.

03:42.583 --> 03:45.791
Then take a seat, spectacled spectator.

03:45.875 --> 03:49.125
[Wrecker chuckles] Spectacled spectator.

03:49.208 --> 03:51.875
All right, all right.
Save it for the course.

03:51.958 --> 03:55.666
You don't have to say it, that's--
I was about to save it for the course.

03:55.750 --> 03:57.291
Excuse me. I can't talk right now.

03:57.375 --> 04:02.041
It's time I prepare for the next race.
Which I'm going to win. TAY-0.

04:05.958 --> 04:08.291
This is a 12 series speeder.

04:08.875 --> 04:11.750
They were not built
for racing speed or durability.

04:11.833 --> 04:13.833
Which is why we modify them.

04:14.416 --> 04:16.666
Behold and be amazed.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.750
Impressive, is it not?

04:19.750 --> 04:22.583
TAY-0 is an artist.

04:22.666 --> 04:25.125
[Millegi] Ciddarin Scaleback.

04:25.916 --> 04:27.041
[chuckles]

04:27.125 --> 04:32.541
It's been a long time since I've seen
your shiny claws around Safa Toma.

04:33.500 --> 04:37.541
Millegi. I'm busy. Get out of my pit.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.875
Not gonna introduce me to your new crew?

04:48.458 --> 04:49.666
[chuckles]

04:50.625 --> 04:52.458
They're not gonna help you win.

04:53.791 --> 04:57.458
Oh, I know I'm gonna win.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.583
You think your droid can beat my champ?

05:04.625 --> 05:06.375
[speaking Nosaurian]

05:06.458 --> 05:07.458
[chuckles]

05:08.416 --> 05:10.000
What's he saying?

05:10.083 --> 05:11.750
You do not want to know.

05:12.333 --> 05:17.583
If you're so confident,
how about our standard side wager?

05:17.666 --> 05:20.833
Let's see who has the better racer.

05:21.916 --> 05:23.125
Deal.

05:23.208 --> 05:25.250
[chuckles]

05:25.833 --> 05:28.333
Just like old times.

05:28.416 --> 05:29.416
[speaking Nosaurian]

05:33.000 --> 05:37.416
[Tech] The familiarity between you two
suggests this race is personal.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.625
This is business.

05:40.625 --> 05:42.541
And we've got a race to win.

05:58.708 --> 05:59.958
Wh-Wh-What did I miss?

06:00.583 --> 06:02.833
[Tech]
Jet Venim and TAY-0 are in the lead.

06:02.916 --> 06:05.041
Given the unpredictable nature
of this course,

06:05.125 --> 06:07.916
I cannot determine who the victor will be.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
[Wrecker grunts]

06:25.791 --> 06:27.375
[rapid beeping]

06:27.458 --> 06:30.000
[crowd gasping]

06:30.083 --> 06:32.041
Hmm? [groans]

06:32.583 --> 06:35.000
[announcer]
<i>A friendly reminder to all our spectators,</i>

06:35.083 --> 06:37.041

06:37.125 --> 06:41.416
<i>Safa Toma Speedway is not liable</i>
<i>for any injury, death, or disintegration.</i>

06:41.500 --> 06:43.791
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>And speaking of injury and death,</i>

06:43.875 --> 06:47.375
<i>the lead racers are approaching</i>
<i>Gambler's Gulch.</i>

06:49.250 --> 06:51.000
[Cid on comm]
<i>Do not take the left tunnel!</i>

06:51.083 --> 06:52.541
TAY-0 knows what he is doing.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.333
What's wrong with the left tunnel?

06:58.416 --> 06:59.666
It's a death trap.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.750
[grunts] This whole race is a death trap.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.958
[announcer] <i>Final lap</i>
<i>and Jet Venim remains in the lead, but--</i>

07:11.041 --> 07:12.041
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

07:12.125 --> 07:14.291
<i>The challenger is closing in fast!</i>

07:14.375 --> 07:17.125
He's gonna do it! TAY-0's gonna do it!

07:21.208 --> 07:23.500
- [comlink beeps]
- Get him in the crunch.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.166
[grunts]

07:40.250 --> 07:42.416
[announcer] <i>Uh-oh, it's "Steel Claw" time!</i>

07:42.500 --> 07:44.666
<i>I feel a Venim crunch coming on!</i>

07:44.750 --> 07:46.416
- [grunts]
- [Cid on comm] <i>Get out of there!</i>

07:54.083 --> 07:55.166
[grunts] No, no, no, no, no.

07:55.250 --> 07:56.875
- Come on, TAY-0!
- [Wrecker grunts]

08:01.250 --> 08:03.291
[announcer] <i>TAY-0 takes a tumble!</i>

08:04.083 --> 08:07.375
<i>And Jet Venim wins!</i>

08:10.291 --> 08:12.041
[laughs]

08:23.166 --> 08:26.916
[Tech] This speeder is in bad shape,
but some of it is salvageable.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.458
That's the least of my problems now,
Goggles.

08:29.541 --> 08:31.833
Hey! Found TAY-0!

08:31.916 --> 08:33.708
[grunts] Or most of him.

08:34.666 --> 08:36.208
Maybe we can put him back together.

08:36.291 --> 08:38.458
[Millegi] I'm here to collect, Cid.

08:40.625 --> 08:45.500
You'll get your credits.
Just give me some time. I'm good for it.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.541
That's not how this works.

08:48.250 --> 08:51.666
You are out of time.

08:51.750 --> 08:55.333
Wanna step in here?
I didn't bring you two for the company.

09:06.583 --> 09:09.666
Wait! How much does she owe?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.500
More than you got, kid.

09:12.083 --> 09:15.375
Well, we're not done yet.

09:17.291 --> 09:20.875
[chuckles] Looks like you're done to me.

09:20.958 --> 09:25.791
One last race.
If you win, we pay you double.

09:28.125 --> 09:31.083
If we win, we get Cid.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.500
You don't know
what you're getting into, kid.

09:37.125 --> 09:39.000
[Tech]
I'm inclined to agree with him, Omega.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.000
Yeah, I'm inclined too.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.791
We don't know anything about racing.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.041
They're gonna hurt Cid if we do nothing.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.416
Do we have a deal?

09:53.666 --> 09:54.708
We race tomorrow.

09:55.875 --> 09:58.958
And I keep Cid as collateral.

10:06.666 --> 10:10.250
For your sakes,
you better be able to pay up.

10:22.625 --> 10:25.958
[sighs] This speeder's in worse shape
than I thought.

10:26.625 --> 10:27.833
How's TAY-0?

10:27.916 --> 10:29.166
Partially operational.

10:29.708 --> 10:32.625
With a few more adjustments,
he may be capable of racing.

10:32.708 --> 10:35.333
Uh, that is hilarious. [chuckles]

10:35.416 --> 10:39.291
I am more than capable. I am ready to--

10:39.833 --> 10:41.333
Where are my arms and legs?

10:42.291 --> 10:44.000
That should be all of it.

10:48.208 --> 10:50.458
No, that's not how you connect the servo.

10:50.541 --> 10:54.000
Let TAY-0 instruct you
on how to do this properly.

10:57.375 --> 11:01.541
You know, instead of repairing him,
we should be taking out that gangster.

11:02.083 --> 11:06.000
We cannot apply our military tactics
to this situation.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.166
Millegi is dangerous and connected.

11:08.708 --> 11:12.416
Even if we extract Cid and escape,
they will seek retribution.

11:12.916 --> 11:16.208
Rumor has it, the last sponsor who failed
to pay Millegi is

11:16.291 --> 11:19.750
now taking a permanent pit stop
in the eastern sand dune.

11:20.333 --> 11:23.541
Which is why we have to win the race
and save Cid.

11:23.625 --> 11:27.500
This is not the first time
she has required our assistance

11:27.583 --> 11:31.083
due to her dealings with individuals
of questionable integrity.

11:31.583 --> 11:33.958
It is a problematic pattern.

11:34.958 --> 11:38.166
Uh, hey, yeah. Did you forget
you were working on me?

11:38.250 --> 11:41.958
'Cause it seems like you're just having
a conversation about nonsense over there.

11:42.041 --> 11:45.333
How about a little less chatter,
a little more spanner?

12:07.000 --> 12:09.041
To old times.

12:09.125 --> 12:12.458
Not interested in old times. I've changed.

12:13.041 --> 12:15.875
Hustlers like us never change.

12:15.958 --> 12:20.208
Sooner or later,
those outcasts you're hanging out with

12:20.291 --> 12:22.166
will get to know the real Cid.

12:23.666 --> 12:25.666
I might surprise you.

12:26.875 --> 12:27.875
[laughs]

12:28.500 --> 12:29.500
I doubt that.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.166
You're racing next, TAY-0.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.875
[chuckles] Think you can win?

12:45.958 --> 12:48.750
[laughs]
I will ignore that obvious question.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.125
Yes. I can.

12:51.208 --> 12:52.833
Well, you lost last time.

12:52.916 --> 12:56.000
That was a miscalculation.
One I will not make twice.

13:01.958 --> 13:04.166
[device beeping]

13:05.916 --> 13:10.416
I'm sorry. Why exactly are you, uh,
studying the track layout?

13:10.500 --> 13:13.625
I am analyzing the course
and patterns of the racers.

13:14.291 --> 13:15.916
It is fascinating.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.166
You are doing it wrong, human.

13:19.250 --> 13:22.083
Calculations won't help you.

13:22.166 --> 13:28.166
It is all about strategy and skill,
of which you have zero.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.666
I believe your strategy to be flawed.

13:31.875 --> 13:34.208
It would be wise to divert power

13:34.291 --> 13:37.208
to the reflector shields
from your primary weapon system.

13:37.291 --> 13:38.625
[laughs]

13:38.708 --> 13:45.208
An amateur mistake. And precisely why
TAY-0 is your only chance at victory.

13:45.708 --> 13:47.291
Open your eyes, human.

13:47.791 --> 13:51.416
If you want to win out there,
offense is the best--

13:54.958 --> 13:58.625
[announcer groans]
<i>We have a wipeout down in the pits!</i>

13:58.708 --> 14:00.250
- [Omega gasps]
- [Wrecker] Whoa!

14:04.250 --> 14:05.250
TAY-0?

14:07.708 --> 14:09.208
[Wrecker] Oh, boy.

14:10.791 --> 14:14.583
Uh, I don't think
he's gonna be able to race.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.833
Safa Toma's a dangerous place.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.541
He's fine.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.666
Snap out of it, tin bin!

14:23.750 --> 14:27.458
I regret nothing.

14:27.541 --> 14:28.875
[powering down]

14:30.125 --> 14:34.291
Tough luck. Looks like a forfeit.

14:34.375 --> 14:38.875
No racer means Cid loses. And so do you.

14:41.291 --> 14:42.958
We have to do something.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.125
I will be the racer.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.166
What? [laughs] Wha--

14:50.250 --> 14:51.416
[speaking Nosaurian]

14:51.500 --> 14:52.791
He's not joking.

14:52.875 --> 14:55.416
You heard him. The bet's still on.

14:57.541 --> 15:01.916
I never stop a fool from giving his life
to make me rich.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.250
[crowd cheering]

15:10.958 --> 15:15.208

<i>Our racers are ready.</i>

<i>Guess he's a late arrival.</i>

<i>Is that his name? Tech? Just Tech?</i>

<i>Okay, and here we go.</i>

[announcer] <i>And they're off!</i>

16:30.208 --> 16:31.708
What place is he in?

16:32.208 --> 16:34.333
Last, but he's catching up.

16:35.333 --> 16:38.083
Tech, you gotta be in front to win!

16:38.166 --> 16:40.583
[Tech on comm] <i>I know what I am doing.</i>
<i>It's called strategy.</i>

16:40.666 --> 16:42.458
No, it's called losing.

16:56.208 --> 16:59.958
[announcer] <i>Uh-oh.</i>
<i>"Mad Bomber" Brix is up to his old tricks!</i>

17:06.458 --> 17:10.125
[Omega on comm] <i>Tech, don't take the</i>
<i>left tunnel. Cid said it's a death trap!</i>

17:14.708 --> 17:17.375
Transmit the schematics of the left tunnel
to my display.

17:17.458 --> 17:18.750
On it.

17:18.833 --> 17:22.291
Right now? Shouldn't you just focus
on not getting blown up?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.875
[Tech on comm] <i>I can do both.</i>

17:34.583 --> 17:36.416
[Omega on comm]
<i>Your shields are overheating!</i>

17:36.500 --> 17:40.250
Yes. I am allowing for adequate energy
to be distributed from weapons to shields.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.416
[Omega on comm]
<i>Tech, they're all over you.</i>

17:43.625 --> 17:45.666
I need more speed.

17:49.458 --> 17:50.541
Tech's coming in.

17:50.625 --> 17:51.666
Well, what's he doing?

17:54.333 --> 17:56.458
- Your weapons.
- [Tech] <i>They were slowing me down.</i>

18:01.000 --> 18:02.416
[announcer]
<i>Tech's got a vaporization wish…</i>

18:02.500 --> 18:03.625
What are they doing?

18:03.708 --> 18:05.708
<i>…and has removed all his weapons.</i>

18:13.541 --> 18:17.125
That worked. I now have increased speed
and maneuverability.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.625
[Wrecker] <i>Yeah, that's great,</i>
<i>but you're still in last place.</i>

18:21.583 --> 18:22.625
[groans]

18:23.583 --> 18:25.083
The tunnel's coming up again.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.458
Wait.
A large part of the track is missing.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.041
<i>That's why the racers avoid it.</i>

18:30.625 --> 18:33.666
It is also the shortest tunnel.
I can use it to my advantage.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.541
[Omega on comm] <i>It's too dangerous.</i>
<i>The speeder can't make that jump!</i>

18:36.625 --> 18:38.458
It will if I'm going fast enough.

18:50.458 --> 18:53.041
[announcer]
<i>Whoa! Looks like a couple blaster brains</i>

18:53.125 --> 18:55.666
<i>took the ole</i>
<i>"Nellis Express to Lotho Minor!"</i>

18:55.750 --> 18:59.333
- <i>A bold move. Let's see how this pans out.</i>
- [laughs]

19:26.166 --> 19:27.541
[grunts]

19:30.291 --> 19:32.291
[Omega on comm]
<i>It worked. You're closing in.</i>

19:54.083 --> 19:55.375
<i>You're losing shields!</i>

19:56.208 --> 19:58.208
[Wrecker on comm]
<i>Don't let 'em box you in!</i>

20:00.958 --> 20:02.041
[cheers]

20:04.250 --> 20:05.250
[cheering]

20:16.416 --> 20:17.458
[groans]

20:17.541 --> 20:20.291
[announcer]
<i>Here they come! It's going to be close!</i>

20:22.041 --> 20:24.708
<i>And the winner is…</i>

20:31.875 --> 20:33.375
<i>Tech!</i>

20:33.458 --> 20:36.041
- Yeah! [laughs]
- Yeah, Tech!

20:36.125 --> 20:37.416
Oh, yeah! [chuckling]

20:37.916 --> 20:40.208
- [cheering]
- [announcer] <i>Tech, right?</i>

20:40.291 --> 20:41.750
<i>Tech wins!</i>

20:45.958 --> 20:46.958
[Omega] You did it!

20:48.291 --> 20:49.458
You sound surprised.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.833
Yeah! [laughs]

20:51.916 --> 20:54.583
I thought you were a goner. [chuckles]

20:55.083 --> 20:59.708
[crowd chanting]
Tech! Tech! Tech! Tech! Tech!

20:59.791 --> 21:05.000
Tech! Tech! Tech! Tech! Tech!

21:06.875 --> 21:08.500
[Wrecker] We're here for Cid!

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
[snorts]

21:12.083 --> 21:13.333
[snarls]

21:13.916 --> 21:14.916
[grunts]

21:15.500 --> 21:18.541
A deal's a deal. We're square.

21:20.125 --> 21:22.166
That was some racing, Goggles.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.375
[speaking Nosaurian]

21:27.958 --> 21:30.250
I, uh-- I-I-- [laughs]

21:30.333 --> 21:32.333
Well, I guess I owe you one.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.291
Yes. I would agree.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I'll make it up to ya.

21:40.958 --> 21:43.541
Come on. We're outta here.

21:48.791 --> 21:50.291
Hey, you three.

21:52.541 --> 21:54.166
You could have walked away.

21:54.958 --> 22:01.083
That loyalty is admirable, but with Cid,
it doesn't always go both ways.

22:02.291 --> 22:04.041
Watch your backs.
