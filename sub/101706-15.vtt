Previously on SWAT...
You know Lee Durham?

00:02.970 --> 00:04.305
The new kid that just
joined 60-Squad?

00:04.438 --> 00:06.074
He gave me this book.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.841
It promotes
surveilling citizens
with no criminal ties.

00:07.975 --> 00:11.179
When he gave me
the book, he used the words
"walk with dignity."

00:11.312 --> 00:13.647
I remembered that list of
white nationalist
code phrases.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.117
Yeah, how'd it go? "I aim
to walk the path
with dignity."

00:16.250 --> 00:17.351
"Pure of body and spirit."

00:17.485 --> 00:19.153
He worked patrol
in Granada Hills.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.489
Black residents make up
5% of that population.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.757
30% of Durham's arrests.
Targeting?

00:23.891 --> 00:25.093
When Durham said those words
to you, it might've been

00:25.226 --> 00:27.695
an attempt to feel you out.
You can use it the same way.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.663
Deacon, nice to see you, man.
DEACON: Gibson and Ellis.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.299
Man, I haven't seen
you clowns in ages.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.334
Here's to walking
the path with dignity.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.391
You were right about Durham
and the code phrase.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.559
What happened?
Well, last night,

00:58.692 --> 01:00.027
he had a little
backyard get-together.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.795
I went.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.732
He made a toast using the
first half of the phrase.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.700
"Walk with dignity."

01:08.602 --> 01:12.340
When I responded with
the second half, he lit up.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.074
It's like he was pleased
I was one of them.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.145
He wasn't the only cop there.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.580
I saw two other guys I know
from my patrol days,
Gibson and Ellis.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.149
You tell Hicks yet?

01:21.949 --> 01:23.384
No.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.519
(SIGHS)

01:27.221 --> 01:28.856
Still trying to make
sense of this.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.524
Make sense of what, man?

01:32.193 --> 01:34.027
If these guys are walking
around with a badge and a gun,

01:34.162 --> 01:35.829
using racist beliefs
to do their job,

01:35.963 --> 01:37.231
they don't belong
on the force, period.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.532
Maybe they were
just blowing off steam.

01:38.666 --> 01:39.867
Maybe it was
the beers talking.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.570
Or maybe you're just
making excuses for them now.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.672
Do you know how many
squared away cops

01:44.805 --> 01:46.340
I have heard say questionable
things and not mean it?

01:46.474 --> 01:48.542
No, Deacon.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.145
I can't imagine.

01:51.279 --> 01:53.881
Because when
I walk up to those
same cops, they go silent.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.549
That stuff
doesn't fly anymore.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.387
So, what do you suggest I do?

01:59.520 --> 02:01.155
Go to Internal Affairs,
get these guys fired

02:01.289 --> 02:03.224
over backyard beer talk?

02:03.357 --> 02:05.092
You can't just do nothing.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.044
That's never a good sign.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.581
Sir, you told me a ways back

06:53.714 --> 06:57.084
that the brass was committed
to improving how it handles
racial violations.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.418
Have you seen something
you need to report?

06:59.887 --> 07:02.556
I'm not saying that I did.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.858
But let's say
I know an officer
with firsthand knowledge

07:04.992 --> 07:06.527
about a group of active,
racist cops.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.197
Now this officer may not want
to come forward

07:10.330 --> 07:11.732
because he knows
the case wouldn't
get anywhere.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.436
But I want to know
what the department will do
to guarantee that it does?

07:18.338 --> 07:20.107
Well, um...

07:22.510 --> 07:25.078
I'm supposed to tell you

07:25.212 --> 07:27.548
this officer needs to report
these racist cops

07:27.681 --> 07:30.050
to I.A. immediately.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.786
We'll stick 'em
on administrative duty,

07:32.920 --> 07:35.155
investigate the claims,
and if they're guilty,

07:36.023 --> 07:37.290
we'll fire their asses.

actually works like that.

I don't know.

the same to make
a charge stick.

for their teammates.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.386
I still catch
the 2:00 a.m. special

10:19.519 --> 10:21.354
at Mel's every night
with the old crew.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.691
Probably be nocturnal
for the rest of my life.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.058
You might still be able
to help us then.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.060
You know who shoots
with this logo?

10:27.194 --> 10:29.963
Mm. Her name's
Lindsey David.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.464
She puts a fire logo
on her things

10:31.598 --> 10:33.233
'cause she thinks
she's hot stuff.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.334
(CHUCKLES)
I'll see what we have on her.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.635
Thanks, man.
Yeah, brother.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.205
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

10:38.338 --> 10:40.674
So, how much all this
set you back?

10:40.808 --> 10:43.476
Oh, I got more than I expected
when I sold off
some of my gear.

10:43.610 --> 10:46.046
I have some free time
on my hands, so why not
live a little, right?

10:46.179 --> 10:47.715
This doesn't sound
like much of a long-term plan.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.317
Don't stress, bro.
Something else
will come along.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.753
And how long's
that gonna take?
As long as it takes.

10:52.886 --> 10:56.189
Because the right wave comes

10:56.323 --> 10:58.125
(LAUGHS)
when it comes.

11:02.796 --> 11:03.663
HONDO: Hey, Deacon.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.102
What's up?

11:10.070 --> 11:12.005
I want to show you something.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.107
I looked into those other cops
that you mentioned

11:14.241 --> 11:15.776
from Durham's
little backyard luau.

11:15.909 --> 11:20.848
Gibson has a list
of excessive force complaints
longer than my arm.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.283
Ellis switched
departments twice

11:23.416 --> 11:24.918
for undisclosed reasons.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.121
Both their arrest records

11:28.255 --> 11:30.123
are as racially skewed
as Durham's.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.325
Why are you showing me this?

11:32.459 --> 11:35.729
Because this isn't
just a few guys making jokes
at a barbecue, man.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.665
This is a group of cops
whose screwed-up views on race

11:38.799 --> 11:40.834
have directly affected
their actions on the job.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.138
So what are we gonna
do about it?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.040
I already did something,

11:47.174 --> 11:48.842
I went to my team leader.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.511
What more
do you expect from me?

11:51.644 --> 11:53.713
More.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.716
Are you really okay
with what you heard?
No, of course not.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.585
But I'm not going to I.A. with
just my word against theirs.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.754
That's not enough.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.089
Those charges
would never stick.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.291
That's why we need
hard evidence.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.593
Evidence that Durham
and his pals can't deny.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.297
You want me to record them?

12:10.430 --> 12:12.465
Well, I highly doubt
that I'm gonna be invited
to the next barbecue.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.267
Cops don't turn on other cops.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.003
But it's okay for them
to turn on Black people?

12:16.669 --> 12:17.771
Other minorities?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.741
Deac, I am trying to make
a difference
in this department.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.111
In this city.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.979
I can't do this by myself.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.480
Well, I can't do that.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.184
I don't want these guys
protected either, but...

12:33.686 --> 12:35.188
I can't do that.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.860
Okay.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.406
STREET: You shoot this,
Lindsey?

12:54.842 --> 12:56.309
It's very good work.
Right?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.045
Made a pretty penny
selling it.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.947
Yeah, I really love
how close you get
to the action.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.816
That angle on the door
as they roll out?

13:02.950 --> 13:04.451
Talk about perfect timing.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.587
Almost seems like
you knew the robbery
was gonna happen

13:07.720 --> 13:08.755
before it happened.

13:08.889 --> 13:09.957
You get there early,

13:10.090 --> 13:11.558
you set up across the street.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.260
These bank robbers
buddies of yours?

13:13.393 --> 13:16.563
I got a text from an unknown
number with
a time and a place.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.798
I'm a stringer, I chase tips.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.268
Look, we just want to stop
these guys before
someone gets killed.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.636
Just let us see your phone
and help us figure out
who they are.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.738
I don't have to do that.

13:25.873 --> 13:28.308
You can't compel me
to give up a source.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.777
You knew a bank robbery
was gonna happen,

13:30.911 --> 13:33.146
and instead of warning
someone, you filmed it.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.447
So if you want us
to come after you...

13:34.581 --> 13:38.151
How? I'm a news-gathering
organization.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.752
I have rights.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.290
You're not getting
ahold of my phone.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.198
Hicks says you found something
big on this robbery crew.
What do you got?

13:51.331 --> 13:52.799
Zarba may not be
one of our robbers,

13:52.933 --> 13:54.434
but his gun was used by them.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.204
Took some digging,
but Deac and I
looked at security footage

13:57.337 --> 14:01.241
within a mile radius
of Zarba's pharmacy robbery
from a year ago, found this.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.878
DEACON: That's Zarba
dumping his gun,

14:05.012 --> 14:07.280
and that's about
30 minutes later.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.817
That's Jon Hardy,
a dishwasher
at the restaurant.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.286
He was laid off a few weeks
later due to cutbacks.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.023
Well, he's got no record.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.658
Says he lives in The Jungle,
has his whole life.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.527
The Jungle?

14:20.660 --> 14:23.296
Hardy's neighborhood used to
be a gang hot spot
in the '90s.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.998
Cops called it The Jungle
because it's small,

14:25.132 --> 14:27.067
dense and dangerous.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.202
But the locals call it
The Jungle because
of the trees.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.204
Name dates back
to when it was built.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.340
Jungle may have had
its rough days
in the past, but it's mostly

14:33.473 --> 14:35.508
working-class families now,
just trying to get by.

14:35.642 --> 14:39.212
In their videos, the crew
promised to deliver the bank's
money back to working people.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.481
Maybe The Jungle's
where they were talking about.

to go back inside.

what was going on

doesn't mean they were
involved in the robberies.

they know was stolen?

right at her.

your name in her mouth,

old haunts, trying to see if

to try playing cop.

going on in your life,

Down-low? Your brother's
the size of a mountain.
There is no down-low with him.

for no good reason.

'cause he couldn't

keep up anymore.

to the next thing,

for a lot of other people.

more seriously.

he's running around
playing P.I.

19:45.084 --> 19:48.888
Feels like he knows
I'm always gonna be there
to catch him when he falls,

19:49.021 --> 19:51.190
so he just keeps jumping.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.630
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

19:57.764 --> 20:00.300
Talk to them up there.
All right?

20:00.433 --> 20:02.134
Ah, it's gonna be a beauty.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.736
Either of you
looking for a place?

20:03.870 --> 20:05.805
Mr. Bosowski, we believe
tenants in your buildings

20:05.938 --> 20:07.740
have been robbing banks
and using the stolen money

20:07.874 --> 20:09.376
to pay off rents in
their neighborhood.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.977
Recognize this guy?
Lives in The Jungle.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.779
He's working with two others
we need to find.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.547
Look, a lot of people,
especially in that area,

20:14.681 --> 20:15.715
do all kinds of things
to make rent.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.049
It's not my responsibility.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.818
Well, if we can get
a look at your books...

20:18.951 --> 20:20.487
(SCOFFS) Not without
a warrant. Sorry.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.788
I got a business to protect.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.990
Even if you have to shut off
some lady's power, right?

20:24.123 --> 20:25.692
Long as you get your
money in the end?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.226
You know,
when the city froze evictions,

20:27.360 --> 20:28.728
they gave a green light
for every cheat in the city

20:28.861 --> 20:30.563
to just stop paying rent.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.465
A lot of those people
can't control what's happening
with their jobs.

20:32.599 --> 20:35.034
I have bills to pay, too.
I can't just stop paying them.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.272
You know what?
I do recognize that guy.

20:39.406 --> 20:43.075
Yeah, he came to an eviction
protest last spring.

20:43.209 --> 20:46.313
Two of his buddies
chained themselves
to my building.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.681
One of them spit on me, so
I took a picture
for my lawyers.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.452
See what I'm dealing with?

20:52.585 --> 20:53.786
I saw that guy in
The Jungle yesterday.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.688
Maybe just found our crew.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.159
We got to get out
of town, lay low.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.861
BARTIS:
What?

21:01.994 --> 21:03.863
Yo, you saw how the block
rallied around us yesterday.

21:03.996 --> 21:07.233
We're heroes. I want
to hit another bank today.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.036
We still got a little cash
left from the last time
we can give out.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.905
I had three more families
reach out to me this morning.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.342
We swore we would try
to save everyone.

21:15.475 --> 21:16.409
We've done a lot of good.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.778
We've helped a lot of people.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.214
But I'm quitting now,

21:22.349 --> 21:23.282
while we're still ahead.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.485
You can't quit.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.220
The job takes three.
Right.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.557
One on the cash,
one on the customers,

21:30.690 --> 21:33.125
while, uh, you beat the hell
out of the manager for fun?

21:33.259 --> 21:35.928
The message is as important
as the cause.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.265
Yeah.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.401
Or maybe you just like
hurting people.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.236
Or being on TV.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.740
Fine. Go.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.612
We can do it ourselves.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.483
I'll have to watch
the customers, so

21:56.616 --> 21:59.652
maybe I'll shoot the bank
manager in the head.

21:59.786 --> 22:01.954
Could shoot the tellers, too.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.956
Much more efficient. Hmm?

22:07.326 --> 22:08.761
Or...

22:11.230 --> 22:13.433
...we do it the way
we always do.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.402
The three of us.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.779
Hey, Sarge, wait up.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.515
Hey, Lee, how's it going?

22:28.648 --> 22:30.517
I'm bored out of my mind.
Hicks got me on Armory duty

22:30.650 --> 22:31.784
all week, and it's not
even my turn.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.486
Rocker says it's
"haze the new guy,"

22:33.620 --> 22:35.788
but Malhotra's new, too,
and he's in the field, so

22:35.922 --> 22:37.990
maybe it's just
"haze the white guy."

22:38.124 --> 22:40.393
We all have to pay our dues.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.361
Yeah, right.
Well, almost all of us.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.130
Hey, the guys and I are
gonna grab a drink

22:44.263 --> 22:46.833

Ah, you know what, I can't.

ever since I joined.

We're still working
that robbery crew, so, uh...

22:52.004 --> 22:53.540
But you know what,
I'll-I'll think about it.

22:53.673 --> 22:56.175

an eviction protest
a year ago,

23:06.018 --> 23:07.386
we were able to I.D.
the rest of our crew.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.155
We already knew Hardy.

23:09.288 --> 23:11.991
No record, using a gun
he found by chance.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.661

criminal type.

in the same boat.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.569
No record either.
Ben Bartis, on the other hand,

23:22.702 --> 23:25.672
he's been brought in
for trespassing, vandalism
and disturbing the peace.

All charges you might get
for expressing

23:27.373 --> 23:29.576
your First Amendment right
a little too loudly.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.410
Hardy and Landolt
lost their jobs last year.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.012
We think Bartis
recruited them

23:33.145 --> 23:35.381
when their landlords began
looking for creative ways
to evict people.

to a screwed-up problem.

23:37.517 --> 23:38.885
If it were just about
the money,

23:39.018 --> 23:41.454
Bartis wouldn't need
to assault a bank employee

23:41.588 --> 23:43.389
or tip off a camera crew;
it's about something more.

23:43.523 --> 23:44.957
When I saw him at the bank,

23:45.091 --> 23:47.026
I didn't see empathy
in his eyes, only anger.

after years of

because she paid rent

it's a felony.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.409

doesn't protect her anymore.

from the robberies.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.542
now they're all gonna be
evicted because of him.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.011
There's nothing
holding him back.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.145
He's going after Bosowski.

31:04.830 --> 31:06.698
(SIRENS WAILING)

31:10.336 --> 31:12.038
(GUNFIRE)

31:12.171 --> 31:13.739
Gunfire from the trailer.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.307
(SIREN WAILS)

31:21.280 --> 31:23.149
Bartis is on the move!
Deac and Street,
check the trailer.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.217
Tan, Chris, you're with me.
We got Bartis.

31:33.625 --> 31:34.826
Go!
(GUNSHOTS)

31:39.365 --> 31:41.633
Chris, count the floors. Move.

31:43.535 --> 31:44.703
Tan.

31:50.977 --> 31:52.144
Fourth floor.

31:57.616 --> 31:58.850
Tan, go right, I got left.

32:00.886 --> 32:02.354
TAN: Bartis, stop!

32:13.499 --> 32:15.201
No way out of this, Bartis!

32:15.334 --> 32:17.603
Your neighborhood's
still gonna grieve
if you end up in a body bag!

32:19.705 --> 32:21.040
I already fixed everything!

32:40.426 --> 32:42.928
(GRUNTS)

32:43.062 --> 32:44.796
What do you mean
you fixed everything?

32:44.930 --> 32:46.898
DEACON: 30-David.
We found Bosowski inside.

32:47.033 --> 32:48.600
Shot in the chest.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.502
We couldn't save him.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.605
Congratulations.
You solved absolutely nothing.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.241
(PANTING)

33:03.149 --> 33:04.616
(ELLIS OVER PHONE)
And I'm just thinking,
"Why are you crying?

33:04.750 --> 33:06.452
Your son was a thug."

33:06.585 --> 33:09.121
GIBSON: It was a double
homicide. Those animals
killed each other.

33:09.255 --> 33:11.623
There's no civility
down there.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.592
DURHAM: Look, I can't wait
for my first raid.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.994
Every bullet is justified,
if you ask me.

33:18.264 --> 33:21.100
Hey. How was
your night?

33:21.233 --> 33:23.135
Was that Lee's voice?

33:24.403 --> 33:26.438
Yeah, um, him
and some of his friends.

33:28.474 --> 33:31.110
That's who I was
with tonight.

33:31.943 --> 33:33.345
Why were you recording them?

33:35.081 --> 33:36.448
It's complicated.

33:40.386 --> 33:43.289
(SIGHS)
Actually, no. It's not.

33:48.460 --> 33:49.461
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

33:52.598 --> 33:55.000
(EXHALES)

33:55.134 --> 33:57.669
They're racists, Annie.

33:57.803 --> 34:03.041
They crack jokes, brag
about breaking the rules,
targeting minorities.

34:04.676 --> 34:07.179
And, uh, tonight, they,

34:07.313 --> 34:09.281
they invited me to join.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.885
What does this kid see in me?

34:14.019 --> 34:16.054
I mean, he could've--
he could've asked anybody.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.824
Lee sees you
as a SWAT leader,

34:18.957 --> 34:22.161
a mentor, fellow father.

34:22.294 --> 34:24.530
No, it's not just that.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.199
We've talked a lot
about the job

34:28.567 --> 34:31.770
a-and I've agreed with some
of the things he said.

34:31.903 --> 34:35.707
I still do. Uh, cops are
being unfairly vilified.

34:35.841 --> 34:39.478
The only way that you should
get ahead is your merit.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.680
No, David, thinking that
doesn't make you a racist.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.015
No.

34:44.983 --> 34:47.353
But the stuff on here?

34:47.486 --> 34:51.089
(EXHALES) I mean, if you
really believe those things,

34:51.223 --> 34:53.525
there's no way that you can
police in an unbiased way.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.797
Hondo tried to tell me,
and I...

35:00.266 --> 35:01.267
I didn't want to believe him.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.901
Yeah, but in the end,
you did.

35:03.034 --> 35:04.603
This time.

35:04.736 --> 35:08.274
But, what, 20 years,

35:08.407 --> 35:10.542
I've laughed off
remarks like that?

35:17.015 --> 35:19.551
Is that who Lee saw?

35:22.087 --> 35:23.555
What kind of person
does that make me?

35:24.456 --> 35:27.459
You are not like those men.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.596
Okay, let's say
that that's true.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.605
Maybe that's not
enough anymore.

35:49.281 --> 35:52.584
DURHAM: Every bullet
is justified, if you ask me.
Bam, bam.

35:52.718 --> 35:56.455
Just freed up a prison cot
for someone who can
actually be rehabilitated.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.757
I don't need
to hear anymore.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.162
You're gonna need
to watch your back.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.432
And not just
for Durham.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.634
All three of the officers
you named

36:08.767 --> 36:10.469
will be removed
from the field immediately.

36:12.271 --> 36:13.905
Are you sure
you want to do this?

36:14.906 --> 36:15.807
No.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.611
But I can't do nothing.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.449
In that case,

36:23.582 --> 36:24.883
I'll need
to show Durham the desk

36:25.016 --> 36:27.519
he'll be watching collect dust
until this is settled.

36:27.653 --> 36:28.987
Thank you, Sergeant.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.225
(DOOR OPENS)

36:36.628 --> 36:38.397
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

36:38.530 --> 36:40.666
(GROANS) You two again?

36:40.799 --> 36:42.701
(WHISPERS) Look, I already
told you everything I saw.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.803
Bartis has been arrested.
It's all over.

36:46.972 --> 36:49.040
Wish I could say that changes
anything around here.

36:49.174 --> 36:51.643
Yeah, we know. That's why
we wanted to ask for a favor.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.345
Do you mind introducing us
to some of your neighbors?

36:53.479 --> 36:55.013
(LAUGHS)

36:55.146 --> 36:57.483
We know the police
have let this
neighborhood down

36:57.616 --> 36:59.751
in the past. We want
to change that.

36:59.885 --> 37:02.020
I've done a lot of work
with a nonprofit law firm

37:02.153 --> 37:04.256
that helps communities
in situations like yours.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.592
They might be able to help.
We would love

37:06.725 --> 37:08.193
to talk to as many people
as we can about it.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.862
We wish we could do more,
but we wanted to do something.

37:13.632 --> 37:15.801
(SIGHS) Not sure
you'll find many folks

37:15.934 --> 37:17.235
interested in talking
to police today.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.973
But I'll ask. Wait right here.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.879
Thank you, Officers.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.683
LUCA: Hey.
Mm.

37:34.185 --> 37:36.522
You hear to chew me out
for tailing Lindsey?

37:36.655 --> 37:39.558
Nah. We wouldn't have... got
that robbery crew without you.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.693
Was still incredibly stupid,

37:41.827 --> 37:43.529
but when has that
ever stopped you before?

37:43.662 --> 37:45.030
I'm actually pretty impressed.

37:45.163 --> 37:46.898
I mean, look,
you knew where to look,

37:47.032 --> 37:48.667
followed your subject,
kept a low profile.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.002
I see why you were
such a great stringer, man.

37:51.136 --> 37:54.072
Look, dude, I told you,
I'll find a new thing.

37:54.205 --> 37:56.342
I'll figure out a way to pay
the bills. Not a big deal.

37:56.475 --> 37:57.909
You're too old
to keep doing this.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.411
If I have a rough
couple of weeks

37:59.545 --> 38:00.746
or months,
I'll handle it.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.047
You just got to
let me be, bro.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.483
Just looking out for you.
I'm...

38:04.616 --> 38:06.151
It's what a big brother's
supposed to do.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.556
You don't even know
what you've done for me
already, do you?

38:12.257 --> 38:13.592
We're Lucas.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.428
Grandpa was O.G. SWAT.

38:16.562 --> 38:19.130
Dad was gonna make sure
that one of us
kept that legacy alive.

38:19.264 --> 38:23.068
You were the go-to kid.
The oldest. I...

38:23.201 --> 38:24.970
You took that burden,
shouldered it,
went down that track.

38:25.103 --> 38:27.739
I...

38:27.873 --> 38:30.909
I got to grow up
just being me.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.580
Thank you for that.

38:44.890 --> 38:47.426
Hey, you remember where Dad
took me on my 21st birthday?

38:48.694 --> 38:51.897
Not a bar for my first beer,

38:52.030 --> 38:55.901
he took me to enroll
in the police academy.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.769
Yeah. But, I mean, it
paid off, though, right?

38:57.903 --> 38:59.938
Look at you. You're rolling
with the best of the best.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.273
Look, I love it. I really do.

39:02.408 --> 39:04.876
But sometimes it feels

39:05.010 --> 39:09.114
like I was cast in this role
without having a choice.

39:09.247 --> 39:11.850
Never thought about
what else I could be.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.619
Maybe that's why
I get on your case

39:13.752 --> 39:15.454
every time
you switch careers,

39:15.587 --> 39:16.955
'cause I'm a little jealous.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.960
I never had that choice.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.663
You're a grown-ass man.
You can do whatever you want.

39:24.796 --> 39:25.864
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

39:25.997 --> 39:27.198
You got nothing
to prove to anybody.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.536
You got a nest egg, right?

39:30.669 --> 39:34.005
You and I,
take the food truck,
tour the country.

39:34.139 --> 39:36.808
(LAUGHS)
Filling bellies,
solving crime.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.380
I can't

39:42.514 --> 39:44.650
talk to the team
about stuff like this.

39:46.317 --> 39:47.819
Thanks.

39:48.654 --> 39:49.855
That's what brothers are for.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.460
DURHAM:
Hey, Kay!

39:54.593 --> 39:56.462
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

39:56.595 --> 39:58.730
An I.A. investigation? Really?

39:58.864 --> 40:00.331
For some words? Is this
some kind of a joke?

40:00.466 --> 40:02.434
Hey. Watch yourself.
You're talking to
a commanding officer.

40:02.568 --> 40:03.702
Oh, are you scared
everyone's gonna hear

40:03.835 --> 40:05.737
how you spied on
another officer?

40:05.871 --> 40:07.839
Recorded me
without my consent?

40:07.973 --> 40:10.041
Lee, why don't we
go outside?

40:10.175 --> 40:12.177
I've got no respect left
for your rank.

40:12.310 --> 40:15.046
You know they pulled me
off the streets
and put me on a desk?

40:15.180 --> 40:17.382
What am I supposed
to tell my wife, huh?

40:17.516 --> 40:19.384
Why don't you tell her
some of the things
you told me?

40:19.518 --> 40:21.987
I'm not ashamed of anything
on that tape. Those are just
truths of the job.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.422
It's the way it is.
We all think those things.

40:24.556 --> 40:26.992
And if you tell me that
you don't, then you're a liar.

40:27.125 --> 40:31.196
If you truly believe that
that's what this job is about,

40:31.329 --> 40:33.965
you never deserved it
in the first place.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.134
My PBA reps are gonna tear
this case to shreds,

40:36.267 --> 40:38.870
and you're gonna be
the only person
hurt by it.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.473
Yeah, they'll put me
back on the street.

40:41.607 --> 40:43.609
But you have to watch your
back the rest of your career.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.076
Whatever's left of it.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.412
At least I won't have to worry
about seeing my face on TV

40:47.546 --> 40:49.681
because something I did
caused this city
or this country

40:49.815 --> 40:50.882
to tear itself apart again.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.058
Good luck with everything.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.714
Sorry it took me a while
to figure out
the right thing to do.

41:23.749 --> 41:24.983
It's all right.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.119
We good?

41:28.954 --> 41:30.221
We're good.
