00:11.881 --> 00:14.710
I had an epiphany
a long time ago,

00:14.753 --> 00:16.842
and I felt God was trying
to tell me something.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.105
But he's been silent since.

00:18.148 --> 00:20.281
So I-I help it along.

00:20.324 --> 00:22.109
Wernicke's area
is a region in the brain

00:22.152 --> 00:23.762
responsible
for interpreting language,

00:23.806 --> 00:25.242
and it's dormant during sleep.

00:25.286 --> 00:27.244
That's why you can't
read text in a dream.

00:27.288 --> 00:28.115
This is a dream.

00:28.158 --> 00:29.768
And you don't exist.

00:29.812 --> 00:32.293
You should take the tour
up Everest in the spring.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.053
I'll stay here.
I'll take care of the girls.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.036
I was using that track
you gave me

00:36.079 --> 00:37.559
to make people crazy.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.691
â™ª La, la, la, la... Do you hear that?

00:39.735 --> 00:42.172
I don't like it. It's scary.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.521
Orson LeRoux,

00:43.565 --> 00:46.350
I overturn your conviction
on all counts.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.265
You are free to go.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.754
Again, there's
no demonic possession?

00:58.797 --> 00:59.885
No.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.670
My wife believes in that stuff.
I don't.

01:01.713 --> 01:04.977
Why is the defense saying you're
possessed by a demon named Roy?

01:05.021 --> 01:07.415
I don't know.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.436
So it's your position that you
blacked out during the killings,

01:09.460 --> 01:10.983
and that's it?

01:11.027 --> 01:12.811
Yep.
Thank you.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.616
What does that mean to you?

01:43.494 --> 01:47.368
"Our Father who art in heaven,

01:47.411 --> 01:53.330
"hallowed be thy name,
thy kingdom come,

01:53.374 --> 01:55.332
thy will..."

01:58.509 --> 02:00.598
How does that feel?

02:21.445 --> 02:23.447
It's George.

02:25.884 --> 02:28.409
Did I wake you?

02:28.452 --> 02:31.107
No, I was waiting for you.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.805
Huh?

02:33.849 --> 02:35.590
Were you waiting for this?

03:10.886 --> 03:12.583
Who are you?

03:12.627 --> 03:15.238
Your husband gave you a gift.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.240
Why didn't you take it?

03:17.284 --> 03:19.938
Go climb your mountain.

03:19.982 --> 03:22.593
How do you know that?

03:22.637 --> 03:24.682
You know how.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.602
Mom.

03:31.646 --> 03:34.388
You were having a nightmare.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.564
Oh. I'm sorry, baby.

03:36.607 --> 03:39.175
It's all right. Just...

03:39.219 --> 03:40.394
Just go back to sleep.

03:40.437 --> 03:42.570
I saw it, too.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.222
No, you weren't. Yesterday
you didn't do your homework.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.682
I saw you.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.771
Mom, when does Dad
come back from Denver?

04:09.814 --> 04:11.792
In a week. He's not
gonna go on the tour.
He's just setting it up.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.818
Is Grandma gonna babysit
while he's gone?

04:13.862 --> 04:16.299
You know what? I think we can
manage without Grandma

04:16.343 --> 04:17.300
for a little bit.Oh.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.259
Really? Has she changed at all?

04:19.302 --> 04:21.348
I mean, has she been
acting differently?

04:23.393 --> 04:25.526
She was like...
Just like a monkey.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.876
Do you remember that guy
that she brought here?

04:27.919 --> 04:29.138
Oh, Leland!

04:29.181 --> 04:32.184
Yeah. Is she still seeing him?

04:32.228 --> 04:34.839
Uh, I don't know.
Was she not supposed to?

04:34.883 --> 04:36.667
Well, she said they broke up. Oh, um...

04:36.711 --> 04:37.905
I hope not. We can talk to her.

04:37.929 --> 04:39.017
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.149
We can ask her.

04:40.192 --> 04:41.324
No, that's all right.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.693
Come on. You guys
are gonna miss the bus.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.458
Let's go. No, I cannot miss the bus.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.068
Go, go. I'm not missing the bus. I'm...

04:46.111 --> 04:49.027
Ooh, don't worry, Mom.
It won't hurt you.

04:49.071 --> 04:52.204
What won't hurt me? Your nightmare.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.859
How do you know
what was in my nightmare?

04:55.991 --> 04:57.906
You told me.

05:01.736 --> 05:04.304
Bye, Mommy! Love you!

05:08.133 --> 05:09.221
Have fun.

05:09.265 --> 05:10.875
Thank you.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.541
Hi, Kristen.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.717
Just thought I'd drop by
to say no hard feelings.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.806
I hope that we can
still be friends,

05:28.850 --> 05:31.132
and work out all the...
Yes, hi, there's a man on our street

05:31.156 --> 05:33.768
watching the schoolgirls and
I think he's touching himself.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.161
Come on, Kristen,
I'm only here to make amends.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.554
It's step nine. Let me look.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.121
I think it's a Chevy.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.079
It's dark blue. License plate...

05:41.123 --> 05:44.996
Kristen, this is a mistake.
I'm not your enemy.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.999
It's a New York plate.
It starts with A-O-C...

05:48.043 --> 05:50.350
Hold on, I think he's leaving.

05:56.312 --> 05:59.054
I came here to make peace.

05:59.097 --> 06:00.142
I found God.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.796
You reap what you sow.

06:01.839 --> 06:04.102
Yeah, you go sow it
somewhere else.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.237
Yes, he's leaving.
I'll call you if he comes back.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.066
Thank you very much.
Have a nice day.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.422
Let me be clear.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.903
I don't believe in any of this. DAVID:
Okay.

06:21.946 --> 06:24.427
Good to know. Wait, wait, wait.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.909
Wait. I-I still need to, uh,
to ask you something.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.911
It's about one of my patients.

06:29.954 --> 06:32.479
She thinks she's...

06:33.523 --> 06:34.829
She wants an exorcism?

06:34.872 --> 06:36.178
Yeah.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.876
And you want her to have one?

06:38.920 --> 06:40.704
No, it's just... it...

06:40.748 --> 06:42.271
I recognize results.

06:42.314 --> 06:44.186
I saw the results
with Caroline Hopkins.

06:44.229 --> 06:46.231
She believed in it,
so she believed

06:46.275 --> 06:47.383
in the results of the exorcism.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.453
Will you please just
talk to my patient?

06:50.497 --> 06:51.846
Sure.

06:54.109 --> 06:56.633
Why are all
these exorcisms women?

06:56.677 --> 06:58.156
Are they?

06:58.200 --> 06:59.941
Yeah.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.986
I don't know.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.861
Kristen, uh, David

07:06.904 --> 07:08.689
and, uh... Ben.

07:08.732 --> 07:12.344
Right. Uh, this
is Eleanor Chakiris.

07:12.388 --> 07:13.781
How far along are you?

07:13.824 --> 07:16.218
Eight and a half months. Twins.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.133
Contractions?

07:18.176 --> 07:22.354
No. I've been feeling this
for four months now.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.182
Oh, my God. What-what
do the doctors say?

07:24.226 --> 07:26.358
That I'm having
a difficult pregnancy.

07:26.402 --> 07:27.708
How can we help you, Eleanor?

07:27.751 --> 07:29.623
You think you're possessed?

07:29.666 --> 07:30.928
No.

07:30.972 --> 07:32.713
Well, I don't understand.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.019
My fetus is.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.458
Certain positions upset him.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.547
Is this your first pregnancy?

07:40.590 --> 07:42.940
Yes. In vitro fertilization.

07:42.984 --> 07:43.941
You said "he."

07:43.985 --> 07:45.290
So you know the sex?

07:45.334 --> 07:47.292
One boy, one girl.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.251
But it's the boy
that you believe

07:49.294 --> 07:50.557
is...?

07:50.600 --> 07:53.298
Why have you come to think

07:53.342 --> 07:55.170
that he's possessed?

07:55.213 --> 08:00.436
At night, there are sounds
inside me. Screams.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.395
And bats.

08:03.439 --> 08:07.225
And my daughter,
she cries constantly,

08:07.269 --> 08:08.836
crying for my help.

08:08.879 --> 08:11.316
Your daughter in your womb?

08:11.360 --> 08:14.450
Yes. She's horrified.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.061
Eleanor.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.846
I have four daughters.

08:18.889 --> 08:20.543
And there were times
during each pregnancy

08:20.587 --> 08:23.546
when I felt that I knew
what they were feeling.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.374
But it were only
my own projections,

08:25.417 --> 08:28.986
what I worried or hoped
they were feeling.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.772
That's not it.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.774
I know the doctors
think I'm nuts,

08:33.817 --> 08:36.777
and you probably do, too, but...

08:43.044 --> 08:46.003
I know what is inside me.

08:46.047 --> 08:48.963
It isn't my son.

08:49.006 --> 08:52.009
It's something else.

08:52.053 --> 08:54.403
Please help me.

08:54.446 --> 08:56.753
Has she seen
a perinatal mental health team,

08:56.797 --> 08:58.538
or an early intervention
psychosis team?

08:58.581 --> 09:00.888
Pregnancy psychosis?
Yeah.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.735
Well, there's no time for them
to work out a treatment plan.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.326
She's due in ten days.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.154
She needs to know we're
doing something now.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.982
Right. BEN: Is this even a thing?

09:08.025 --> 09:09.636
A fetus becoming possessed?

09:09.679 --> 09:11.681
I've never heard of it.

09:11.725 --> 09:15.511
But I'll talk to my superiors.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.079
So who is there?

09:18.122 --> 09:22.083
David, Kristen,
uh, the other one.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.998
The pregnant patient.Okay.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.435
Keep me in touch.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.700
Oh, God.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.702
Mom, look at me.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.443
What? I am. What?

09:35.705 --> 09:37.664
Are you still dating
Leland Townsend?

09:37.707 --> 09:39.100
Who said that? Andy?

09:39.143 --> 09:42.103
Leland knew that Andy
gave me this.

09:42.146 --> 09:44.801
And there are only three people
who know about it. You,

09:44.845 --> 09:46.455
Andy and me.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.935
Yeah. We should stop this.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.850
No, we won't.Baby, I'm sorry,

09:49.893 --> 09:51.436
but you don't get to
determine who I date.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.462
You lied to me, Mother.
You kept seeing Leland,

09:53.505 --> 09:54.700
and you kept
feeding him information.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.247
Kristen, this is not a war,

09:56.291 --> 09:57.529
I'm not feeding
anybody anything.

09:57.553 --> 09:58.510
I'm just talking with my lover.

09:58.554 --> 10:00.948
Oh, my God! He's a psychopath.

10:00.991 --> 10:03.037
Come on, stop it.
You need to grow up.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.493
And stop judging... No, I'm not gonna
have you put the girls in danger.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.084
It's your choice.
You choose Leland

10:07.128 --> 10:09.478
or your family.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.306
Wow.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.917
So, let me be clear.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.354
You... What you're saying
is I have to choose

10:16.398 --> 10:20.663
whether to babysit
your daughters for free

10:20.707 --> 10:22.447
or spend the afternoons
with my lover?

10:22.491 --> 10:25.320
Well, then, it should be
very easy for you to choose.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.366
You know what love is?

10:28.410 --> 10:31.456
Leland isn't asking me to make
this choice. Only you are.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.155
And your answer?

10:45.253 --> 10:47.472
Bye.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.524
Uh, is Kristen here?

10:55.567 --> 10:56.568
Yeah, she's in there.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.703
Kristen, hey.
You have a minute?

11:00.747 --> 11:02.531
Yeah, of course. Come in.

11:03.793 --> 11:08.319
Look, um, I'm sorry about court.

11:08.363 --> 11:11.714
No. That's not
what this is about.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.237
We have an assault complaint.

11:13.281 --> 11:14.891
Excuse me?

11:14.935 --> 11:16.980
An assault complaint

11:17.024 --> 11:18.678
in front of your house.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.854
A man who says you accosted him.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.206
It's not funny.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.469
Mira, it really is.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.428
A serial killer sits outside of
my house trying to intimidate me

11:30.472 --> 11:32.430
by watching my girls,
and now he's accusing me

11:32.474 --> 11:34.191
of accosting him. He's not a serial killer.

11:34.215 --> 11:35.738
Yes, he is. I convinced him

11:35.782 --> 11:38.393
not to press charges, but I need
you to stay away from him.

11:38.436 --> 11:40.743
I didn't even touch the guy,

11:40.787 --> 11:42.658
and he was in front of my house.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.921
As long as you hear me.

11:48.969 --> 11:51.449
I mean...

11:55.105 --> 11:58.021
What do you, what do you mean
it-it feels like the baby is...

11:58.065 --> 12:00.502
No, it doesn't feel
like he's eating me,

12:00.545 --> 12:02.330
he is eating me,

12:02.373 --> 12:04.636
from the inside.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.944
I can feel his teeth.
I can hear it.

12:07.988 --> 12:11.339
Eleanor, pregnancy
can be frightening.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.167
There-there are
a lot of things happening

12:13.210 --> 12:14.646
to your body that no... Stop it.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.606
I know you mean well,

12:17.649 --> 12:20.652
but I'm so tired of people
not listening to me.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.524
Please listen to me.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.569
Eleanor,

12:24.613 --> 12:25.745
can I try a test?

12:25.788 --> 12:28.138
Please.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.318
Please pick that up

12:34.362 --> 12:36.581
and hold it in your hand.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.636
Is it burning your hand?

12:47.679 --> 12:50.204
No.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.946
It's not hurting you at all?

12:54.208 --> 12:56.210
No.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.994
Then I don't think
you're possessed.

12:58.038 --> 13:01.171
If the Devil was
taking possession,

13:01.215 --> 13:02.999
you'd feel it burning
in your hand.There.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.045
Place it there.

13:16.056 --> 13:19.102
I believe in God,
Father Almighty,

13:19.146 --> 13:21.061
creator of Heaven and Earth...

13:23.759 --> 13:25.892
Creator of Heaven and Earth.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.242
And to Jesus Christ,

13:28.285 --> 13:32.072
His only son.

13:37.686 --> 13:42.125
It's the Devil inside me.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.693
Please,

13:44.736 --> 13:48.088
get him out
before he k-kills me.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.005
â™ª

14:09.152 --> 14:10.675
Leland?
Hello.

14:10.719 --> 14:14.157
Hi.
Thank you for this.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.419
Oh, yeah.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.944
Are you sure Kristen
won't notice it's gone?

14:17.987 --> 14:19.206
I made copies.

14:19.249 --> 14:22.426
My smart girl.

14:22.470 --> 14:24.907
I love ancient documents, too.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.300
Can you figure it out? No.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.434
Did your daughter? I don't think so.

14:30.478 --> 14:33.916
She keeps studying it. Say,

14:33.960 --> 14:35.875
let me see your keys.

14:35.918 --> 14:38.834
Why? Just let me see them.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.401
Fine.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.055
Thank you.

14:42.098 --> 14:45.145
What're you doing?
What're you doing?

14:45.188 --> 14:48.235
Let me see.
What-What-What're you doing? Don't look.

14:48.278 --> 14:49.584
Okay.

14:49.627 --> 14:53.414
Here then. I was trying
to put my key on it.

14:55.068 --> 14:58.245
How romantic, keys.Yes.

14:58.288 --> 14:59.637
Sorry, just a second.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.204
Oh, no. Hey, if you
have a patient,

15:01.248 --> 15:03.859
I can... I-I can come... No, no, no, no.

15:03.903 --> 15:07.994
Bouchard's house key...
Make a copy, then give it back.

15:12.346 --> 15:15.305
She needs an exorcism, Father,

15:15.349 --> 15:17.003
and Amara is in Rome.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.135
Kristen? I've psychologically
evaluated her,

15:19.179 --> 15:21.485
and from my observation,
she does not seem

15:21.529 --> 15:23.531
to be suffering
from any delusional disorder.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.117
And we've checked
her home for toxicity,

15:25.141 --> 15:26.621
and there was none.

15:26.664 --> 15:28.381
Unfortunately, what this woman
is asking for is impossible.

15:28.405 --> 15:31.017
An unborn child
cannot be possessed.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.628
But isn't a child a cognizant
creation even in the womb?

15:33.671 --> 15:35.325
If not, then why

15:35.369 --> 15:37.327
is abortion a sin? But no demon

15:37.371 --> 15:40.374
can possess a person until
that person gives an invitation,

15:40.417 --> 15:42.376
and an unborn child
lacks that ability.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.812
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, wait,

15:43.855 --> 15:47.033
so you can't perform
an exorcism because the fetus

15:47.076 --> 15:49.426
can't choose, right? The unborn child.

15:49.470 --> 15:53.387
Okay, right.
So what if it's an infestation?

15:54.431 --> 15:56.999
Infestation of what?

15:57.043 --> 15:58.305
The womb.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.742
Ben's right.

16:00.785 --> 16:04.833
You can exorcise the womb even
if the fetus isn't possessed.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.882
That's not bad
for a non-believer.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.191
Excuse me for a second.

16:17.759 --> 16:21.067
Hello? ORSON: Hi, Kristen.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.243
Why are you calling me, Orson?

16:23.286 --> 16:24.505
To apologize.

16:24.548 --> 16:27.290
As you know,
I have become a Christian,

16:27.334 --> 16:29.118
and I would like to make amends.

16:29.162 --> 16:32.034
So I would like to apologize
for everything...

16:32.078 --> 16:34.297
Ben....that I've done to you.

16:34.341 --> 16:37.300
I'd like to apologize
for fantasizing

16:37.344 --> 16:39.215
about killing you.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.130
It's Orson.
Yeah?

16:41.174 --> 16:42.697
How do I record this?

16:42.740 --> 16:44.481
Do you have
a phone recording app?

16:44.525 --> 16:45.656
Sharp end of a shovel...

16:45.700 --> 16:47.354
Yeah? I don't know.

16:47.397 --> 16:50.270
And I'm so sorry about

16:50.313 --> 16:53.360
imagining snapping the necks
of your little girls.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.449
Record it!
Okay, okay.

16:55.492 --> 16:59.148
I now know that that is wrong,

16:59.192 --> 17:02.499
and I would like to make amends.

17:02.543 --> 17:06.112
I just want you to know
that I have asked God

17:06.155 --> 17:08.070
for forgiveness, Kristen.

17:08.114 --> 17:12.640
Yeah? Again, I'm sorry.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.903
Sorry for what?

17:18.689 --> 17:22.389
Ugh, damn. I think I only got
his apologies.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.826
I'm gonna need your help
with something.

17:33.269 --> 17:37.012
Okay, so you are basically

17:37.056 --> 17:38.492
Fort Knox.Good.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.407
And here are your new keys.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.191
All right.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.367
And your security
alarm code is "duck."

17:44.411 --> 17:46.413
Duck? Why duck? Yeah.

17:46.456 --> 17:49.372
I don't know, because
if somebody shoots you, you...

17:49.416 --> 17:52.071
Duck.Yeah. Right.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.116
Thanks, Ben. Yeah, you're welcome.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.292
So is the exorcist
gonna go through with it?

17:56.336 --> 17:57.728
I don't know. He wants to do

17:57.772 --> 18:01.080
another test during mass. What test?

18:03.473 --> 18:05.127
This is the Lamb of God

18:05.171 --> 18:07.477
who takes away
the sin of the world.

18:07.521 --> 18:10.306
Happy are those called
to the supper of the Lamb.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.482
Lord, I am not worthy

18:12.526 --> 18:15.529
that you should
enter under my roof,

18:15.572 --> 18:18.401
but only say the word
and my soul

18:18.445 --> 18:20.795
shall be healed. So you used to believe
in all this?

18:20.838 --> 18:23.493
Yeah.

18:23.537 --> 18:27.410
In school, we were taught that
if you bit into the host... Mm-hmm.

18:27.454 --> 18:31.545
It would bleed Christ's blood.

18:31.588 --> 18:34.374
Wow.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.332
Lot of blood
in your religion.
Yup.

18:36.376 --> 18:37.377
Shh.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.556
How's the baby?

18:42.599 --> 18:44.993
Fine now. Quiet.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.038
That's good.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.653
The body of Christ.Amen.

19:00.704 --> 19:03.577
The body of Christ.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.499
Oh, my God.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.946
- Good evening, Eleanor.
- I'm Dr. Collin Marks.

19:26.426 --> 19:29.168
Hi, sir.
Are you the father? No, I'm just a friend.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.081
I want him to stay.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.474
Well, it appears as if

19:31.518 --> 19:33.781
we're waiting for
your regular OB-GYN,

19:33.824 --> 19:35.086
who will be on her way shortly.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.306
Turn the monitor back on.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.221
Once your OB-GYN arrives...

19:39.265 --> 19:40.831
Turn it back on.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.319
Where's my baby?

19:50.363 --> 19:51.755
Well, there, ma'am.

19:51.799 --> 19:54.236
No, I had twins.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.369
That's just one.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.894
Where's my daughter?

20:08.816 --> 20:11.079
It does happen on occasion,
a parasitic twin.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.473
Parasitic? That's the technical term.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.320
It's when a twin stops
developing during gestation,

20:15.344 --> 20:18.391
but is still attached
to the developing twin.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.523
Wouldn't you still
see it on the sonogram?

20:20.567 --> 20:22.090
There's nothing there.Yes.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.328
That's vanishing twin syndrome.

20:23.352 --> 20:24.701
Seriously?

20:24.745 --> 20:27.443
Yes. It's when one
of the fetuses expires in utero

20:27.487 --> 20:29.010
and is absorbed by the other.

20:29.053 --> 20:31.055
Or eaten.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.187
No,

20:32.231 --> 20:34.276
not eaten, Eleanor,
just absorbed.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.671
Just because you have
a name for something

20:37.714 --> 20:40.369
doesn't mean it's not insane.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.545
It is an unfortunate occurrence.

20:42.589 --> 20:45.940
Usually it doesn't happen
this late in a pregnancy,

20:45.983 --> 20:47.550
but here we are.

20:47.594 --> 20:50.205
The good news is the remaining
child is healthy and strong.

20:52.381 --> 20:55.254
Um, could you please
give us just a second?

20:55.297 --> 20:57.256
Of course.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.390
Help me, David.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.655
I was the coolest guy
in school. Turns out...

21:05.699 --> 21:07.962
Mom, what're you doing?
You said we could watch TV.

21:08.005 --> 21:11.661
Okay, quiet. Listen up.
These are keys, four of them.

21:11.705 --> 21:14.055
They are for you,
and only for you. Why?

21:14.098 --> 21:15.293
What happened? Where's Grandma?

21:15.317 --> 21:16.512
Grandma's gonna
take a break for a while.

21:16.536 --> 21:17.687
And I'm hiring a babysitter,
and until then,

21:17.711 --> 21:19.190
Lynn's in charge... Lynn?

21:19.234 --> 21:21.323
Raise your hand.
I'm Lynn and I'm in charge.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.258
And Matilda's gonna come over
for the rest of the night, okay?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.303
To watch you guys in an hour,
and whatever she says goes.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.329
Candy salad for dinner, then. Yeah!

21:27.373 --> 21:28.330
Except for that.
No, because Lynn's in charge.

21:28.374 --> 21:29.766
Okay, look at me for a second.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.353
Ben put security alarms
on all the windows.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.639
Ben the Magnificent?

21:32.682 --> 21:34.162
Yes, and he dead-bolted

21:34.205 --> 21:36.295
all the doors,
so nobody can get in.

21:36.338 --> 21:39.341
If somebody knocks at the door,
you look through

21:39.385 --> 21:40.690
the peephole, okay?

21:40.734 --> 21:42.562
Easy! Good! Here, a kiss.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.694
And kisses... No, no, no!

21:44.738 --> 21:46.217
For all of you... one, two...

21:46.261 --> 21:48.394
three...

21:49.308 --> 21:50.570
What's that?
What?

21:50.613 --> 21:52.354
You-You've got blood.

21:52.398 --> 21:53.834
I brushed my teeth too hard.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.226
Why'd you do that?

21:55.270 --> 21:56.358
I don't know.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.881
Okay, don't do
that anymore, okay?

21:57.925 --> 21:59.206
I'll set up
a dentist appointment.

21:59.230 --> 22:00.667
Okay.
All right.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.321
Stop sucking our blood.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.409
We don't have enough...

22:05.628 --> 22:08.501
â™ª

22:18.424 --> 22:20.339
We beg you to hear us, God.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.341
We beg you to spare us,
to pardon us.

22:22.384 --> 22:25.082
We beg you to hear us.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.128
Bring us into true penance.

22:27.171 --> 22:29.304
We beg you to hear us.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.786
That you govern
and preserve your holy Church.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.527
We beg you to hear us.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.399
We beg you to spare us...

22:39.575 --> 22:42.230
We beg you to spare us,
to pardon us.

22:42.273 --> 22:43.927
We beg you to hear us.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.712
Bring us into true penance.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.409
We beg you to hear us.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.193
To govern and preserve
your holy Church.

22:52.501 --> 22:54.242
My love, how are you?

22:54.285 --> 22:55.765
I'm fine.

22:55.809 --> 22:59.378
I'm just...

22:59.421 --> 23:02.032
My family is the most important
thing in the world to me.

23:02.076 --> 23:05.645
And my daughter has, um...

23:05.688 --> 23:08.691
Well, she's presented me with

23:08.735 --> 23:09.910
an ultimatum.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.564
Oh, no.
Yeah.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.696
My granddaughters or you.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.616
That's why I want you
to be myfamily.

23:20.660 --> 23:23.227
Leland. What...?

23:24.272 --> 23:25.621
Please, Sheryl.

23:25.665 --> 23:29.451
I know I'm not much,
but I can't lose you.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.279
Sheryl, will you marry me?

23:31.322 --> 23:33.063
We need to make

23:33.107 --> 23:34.238
my family accept you.

23:34.282 --> 23:35.849
I want that, too.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.851
Then...

23:37.894 --> 23:39.592
Then, okay.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.245
Yes, I will.

23:49.253 --> 23:50.472
To spare us, to pardon us.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.561
We beg you to hear us.

23:52.605 --> 23:53.693
Hey.

23:53.736 --> 23:55.085
Hi.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.609
Bring us into true penance.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.306
We beg you to hear us.

23:58.349 --> 24:01.570
To govern and preserve
your holy Church.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.267
How you doing?

24:03.311 --> 24:04.878
Oh, I don't know.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.884
I watched you in church.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.363
Yeah.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.540
You had a different
look on your face.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.193
One I hadn't seen before.

24:18.369 --> 24:21.895
What do you see in it?

24:23.766 --> 24:27.640
I know only one line
of Shakespeare.

24:27.683 --> 24:30.120
One I memorized.

24:30.164 --> 24:31.600
Are you about to impress me?

24:33.123 --> 24:35.430
I'll try.
Okay.

24:37.258 --> 24:38.781
"When this body

24:38.825 --> 24:41.218
"contained a spirit,

24:41.262 --> 24:42.176
"a kingdom

24:42.219 --> 24:45.396
"was too small to hold it;

24:45.440 --> 24:48.356
"now two paces

24:48.399 --> 24:51.185
"of the vilest earth

24:51.228 --> 24:53.361
is room enough."

24:56.103 --> 24:57.408
Thank you.

25:00.194 --> 25:03.371
But-but that's the point to me.

25:03.414 --> 25:05.591
I don't know

25:05.634 --> 25:08.376
how we die

25:08.419 --> 25:11.292
and our, our lives just

25:11.335 --> 25:13.381
disappear with us.

25:13.424 --> 25:16.689
It makes no sense to me.

25:16.732 --> 25:20.562
I don't know why people
aren't unnerved by it.

25:20.606 --> 25:23.217
So, it's fear of death?

25:23.260 --> 25:24.348
Yes.

25:28.265 --> 25:30.354
I, uh, I knew this...

25:30.398 --> 25:32.705
Navy SEAL.
Mm-hmm.

25:32.748 --> 25:35.664
Greatest man I ever knew.

25:35.708 --> 25:39.363
And funny.

25:39.407 --> 25:43.585
He could do this imitation
of, uh, Will Ferrell...

25:45.282 --> 25:49.548
He could quote Herman Melville,
do backflips.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.288
He could act as, uh,

25:51.332 --> 25:54.378
peacemaker for any dispute.

25:54.422 --> 25:57.599
And the next day, he was gone.

25:59.775 --> 26:01.777
Dead in a firefight.

26:04.432 --> 26:07.043
And I looked at that body,

26:07.087 --> 26:09.872
and I knew the meaning

26:09.916 --> 26:12.222
of that passage.

26:12.266 --> 26:15.225
"When this body

26:15.269 --> 26:17.010
"contained a spirit,

26:17.053 --> 26:18.707
"a kingdom

26:18.751 --> 26:22.102
"was too small to hold it;

26:22.145 --> 26:25.235
"now two paces

26:25.279 --> 26:28.282
of the vilest earth..."

26:37.900 --> 26:40.381
I have to go be with my kids.

26:43.297 --> 26:45.255
Are you gonna be all right?

26:45.299 --> 26:46.300
Yeah.

26:46.343 --> 26:48.345
Go.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.481
I'm glad we're talking again.

26:54.569 --> 26:55.831
Were we not?

26:57.485 --> 26:58.791
For a minute there.

27:00.096 --> 27:03.186
I'm glad, too.

27:53.236 --> 27:56.065
Matilda?

28:17.217 --> 28:19.393
Hello?

28:22.701 --> 28:24.137
Let me in.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.139
I have an old key.

28:26.182 --> 28:27.401
Why should I let you in?

28:27.444 --> 28:29.969
You know why.

28:42.416 --> 28:44.461
Hello?

28:44.505 --> 28:47.551
Let's go.

28:47.595 --> 28:49.292
Where?

28:49.336 --> 28:53.122
The next level.

28:53.166 --> 28:55.603
No!

28:59.825 --> 29:01.740
We beg you to hear us, God.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.743
We beg you to
spare us, pardon us.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.440
We beg you to hear us.

29:06.483 --> 29:09.791
Bring us into true penance.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.488
We beg you to hear us.

29:11.532 --> 29:13.447
To govern and preserve
your holy Church.

29:13.490 --> 29:16.537
We beg you to hear us.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.848
â™ª

29:40.430 --> 29:43.607
What are you doing?

29:43.651 --> 29:44.565
That's...

29:44.608 --> 29:46.088
"Pudsy's Christmas."

29:46.132 --> 29:49.048
Is that from here?
Yeah.

29:49.091 --> 29:51.572
"RSM... Fertility."

29:53.661 --> 29:55.619
There.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.148
What?

30:06.021 --> 30:07.631
â™ª

30:13.420 --> 30:15.291
It's an Euler triangle.

30:33.005 --> 30:35.616
Lexis! Lexis!

30:35.659 --> 30:38.010
Lexis, what are you doing?!

30:38.053 --> 30:39.272
Mom, what...?

30:39.315 --> 30:40.534
What are you doing down here?

30:40.577 --> 30:42.144
Where are your sisters?

30:42.188 --> 30:43.276
They're sleeping upstairs.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.539
I wanted to wait up for you.

30:49.325 --> 30:51.458
Where did this come from?

30:51.501 --> 30:53.808
I don't know.

31:00.380 --> 31:02.773
Okay.

31:02.817 --> 31:05.298
You go upstairs.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.955
And go sleep in your bedroom.

31:09.998 --> 31:11.695
And I will be right
back, come on.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.132
Up the stairs you go.

31:13.175 --> 31:14.655
Where are you going?

31:14.698 --> 31:16.048
Go right ahead.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.266
I love you.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.312
I'll be right back, okay?

31:22.184 --> 31:24.578
â™ª

31:38.070 --> 31:39.419
May I help you?

31:39.462 --> 31:42.857
Yeah, uh, I was just looking
for some information

31:42.901 --> 31:46.078
about some of the services
that the clinic provides.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.470
Do you have a pamphlet?

31:47.514 --> 31:49.908
Uh, we do, but we prefer
to do everything online now.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.170
Hmm.

32:00.483 --> 32:04.052
Do you have any recommendations
from other families

32:04.096 --> 32:05.314
who have used your services?

32:05.358 --> 32:07.969
We do. Look at our boards.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.319
All parents who struggled
with fertility

32:10.363 --> 32:11.930
until they had great
experiences here.

32:11.973 --> 32:14.149
We have a special program
called "Dads to Be."

32:14.193 --> 32:16.282
We're a single
source destination,

32:16.325 --> 32:18.762
with egg donation agencies
and attorneys

32:18.806 --> 32:20.112
that specialize in reproduction.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.940
Huh. Well, thanks.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.376
Uh, I'll just talk to David.

32:25.682 --> 32:27.225
I know this child. Oh, that makes sense.

32:27.249 --> 32:29.251
There are many from the area.

32:29.295 --> 32:31.950
Eric McCrystal? Well, I-I can't give out
any information

32:31.993 --> 32:33.623
until I've asked the parents
if it's all right.

32:33.647 --> 32:36.519
That's the kid that
tried to drown his baby sister.

32:36.563 --> 32:38.521
You know who recommended
that we use you?

32:38.565 --> 32:39.958
No, who?

32:40.001 --> 32:41.960
Bridget and Dwight Ferrell.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.570
Oh, yes, they were such
a nice couple.

32:43.613 --> 32:45.224
I-I was so sorry

32:45.267 --> 32:47.008
to hear about their miscarriage.

32:47.052 --> 32:50.359
Yes. It was unfortunate.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.840
But in vitro sometimes
needs more than one try.

32:52.883 --> 32:54.963
Again, I really think
you should join our Dads to Be.

32:56.148 --> 32:57.888
So what are we thinking?

32:57.932 --> 33:00.021
I think I understand.

33:00.065 --> 33:02.023
What?

33:03.068 --> 33:06.027
Matthew 13.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.247
"The kingdom of heaven
is like a man

33:08.290 --> 33:10.684
"who sowed good seed
in his field.

33:10.727 --> 33:12.251
"But while everyone
was sleeping,

33:12.294 --> 33:15.080
his enemy came and sowed weeds
among the wheat."

33:15.123 --> 33:17.430
David, I don't get parables.
Just tell me.

33:17.473 --> 33:20.955
These are the weeds. The eggs.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.106
The Slaughter of the Innocents

33:22.130 --> 33:24.089
isn't killing two-year-olds.

33:24.132 --> 33:27.309
It's corrupting the eggs.

33:27.353 --> 33:29.529
It's like Boys from Brazil.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.444
What is that? My own parable.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.228
It's a movie about these people,

33:33.272 --> 33:36.188
they're trying to clone
little Hitlers from his DNA.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.369
Oh, damn.
What happened?

33:43.412 --> 33:45.936
Eleanor's water broke.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.071
Hey.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.333
You heard, too?

33:51.377 --> 33:52.900
Yes. You guys all right?

33:52.943 --> 33:56.164
Yeah. We have to tell you
about The Boys from Brazil.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.470
Is she all right? Yeah. Yeah.

33:57.513 --> 33:59.167
She's in labor. DAVID:
Was it successful?

33:59.211 --> 34:01.343
The exorcism? LUKE:
It wasn't complete.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.563
Her water broke.

34:06.261 --> 34:07.219
Kristen.

34:07.262 --> 34:08.220
Yeah?

34:08.263 --> 34:10.352
You got blood on your leg.

34:10.396 --> 34:11.658
Huh? Oh.

34:11.701 --> 34:13.442
Thanks.

34:18.882 --> 34:20.797
Hey, why do you have
blood on your leg?

34:20.841 --> 34:23.061
I don't have blood on my leg.

34:23.104 --> 34:24.236
See?

34:25.846 --> 34:29.110
Do you want me to say that I
never saw blood on your leg?

34:29.154 --> 34:32.331
I want you to see there
isn't blood on my leg. See?

34:33.245 --> 34:35.290
You're okay, right?

34:35.334 --> 34:37.118
Yeah. I'm spectacular.

34:37.162 --> 34:39.512
When my family's safe,
I am spectacular.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.253
And the security system works?

34:41.296 --> 34:42.645
"Duck."

35:00.315 --> 35:01.708
So, is that him?

35:01.751 --> 35:03.101
Yes.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.320
That doesn't look
like the Devil to me.

35:05.364 --> 35:07.844
What does the Devil look like?

35:07.888 --> 35:09.368
Well...

35:09.411 --> 35:13.372
It's a question of nature
versus nurture, right?

35:13.415 --> 35:15.374
Even with what we saw today?

35:15.417 --> 35:17.376
What did you see today?

35:17.419 --> 35:21.380
Uh, we saw the clinic
where she had her in vitro.

35:21.423 --> 35:23.730
David thinks
that the psychopaths

35:23.773 --> 35:26.211
are tinkering
with the fertilized eggs.

35:26.254 --> 35:29.779
So, what's the thinking,
the psychopaths are...?

35:29.823 --> 35:32.042
Trying to poison a generation.

35:32.086 --> 35:33.305
Why tempt people later in life

35:33.348 --> 35:35.220
when you can start
before they're born?

35:35.263 --> 35:37.047
Why are you certain of this?

35:37.091 --> 35:39.354
The clinic appeared
in my vision.

35:39.398 --> 35:41.574
"RSM Fertility."

35:45.012 --> 35:46.753
What?

35:46.796 --> 35:48.233
Oh, my...

35:48.276 --> 35:49.582
Kristen, what?

35:51.845 --> 35:54.064
I went to RSM Fertility.

35:54.108 --> 35:57.459
I-I had a miscarriage
after Lila.

35:57.503 --> 36:01.115
I-I had a baby born
using in vitro.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.207
Lexis.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.672
Who is it?

36:36.716 --> 36:38.718
Why doesn't my key work?

36:41.068 --> 36:42.785
Because I changed the locks.
Seriously, Kristen?

36:42.809 --> 36:46.204
Yeah. Seriously.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.249
What do you need?

36:48.293 --> 36:50.512
Can I come in?

36:50.556 --> 36:52.514
Thank you.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.124
Uh...

36:55.387 --> 36:57.650
Leland and I are getting married

36:57.693 --> 37:01.175
and I came here to ask
you to be happy for us.

37:01.219 --> 37:05.745
I have never been as happy
as I am right now, ever.

37:06.398 --> 37:08.313
And I'm asking you
to just please,

37:08.356 --> 37:09.618
just overlook your bias

37:09.662 --> 37:11.577
against him

37:11.620 --> 37:14.014
and love me?

37:14.057 --> 37:15.929
I'm your mother, honey.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.627
And I-I carried you
and I cared for you,

37:18.671 --> 37:20.977
and I'm just asking you
to do the same.

37:21.021 --> 37:22.501
Whatever bad blood

37:22.544 --> 37:25.068
is between you and
Leland can be settled.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.114
I know it can.

37:31.597 --> 37:33.599
Or not.

37:35.644 --> 37:38.386
Oh, come on, Kristen,
just say yes.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.562
I can't lose you.
Please, can you just...

37:42.608 --> 37:43.739
"with thee.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.350
"Blessed are thou among women,

37:45.393 --> 37:48.527
blessed is the fruit
of thy womb Jesus."

37:53.053 --> 37:55.055
God.

37:57.100 --> 38:00.016
Tell me how to stop them.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.258
â™ª

38:48.848 --> 38:50.850
â™ª

39:07.693 --> 39:10.348
â™ª

40:12.801 --> 40:14.803
â™ª

40:27.729 --> 40:28.948
Hello?

40:28.991 --> 40:30.732
Kristen. It's Mira.

40:30.776 --> 40:33.082
Hi. Is everything all right?

40:33.126 --> 40:35.345
Yeah.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.870
LeRoux is dead.

40:37.913 --> 40:41.395
Uh... Oh, my God. How?

40:41.439 --> 40:44.093
I-I don't know.
He was bludgeoned.

40:44.137 --> 40:47.009
We're thinking by his wife,
but we're not sure.

40:47.053 --> 40:49.011
I'm so sorry.

40:49.055 --> 40:51.318
That is, that is,
that is terrible.

40:51.361 --> 40:53.363
No, it's not.

40:53.407 --> 40:56.366
I-I just wanted
to tell you, that's all.

40:56.410 --> 40:58.412
Your troubles are over.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.459
Have a good night.
