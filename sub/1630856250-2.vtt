00:06.966 --> 00:08.259
<i>Previously on</i> Reacher...

00:11.220 --> 00:12.096
I got your message.

00:12.096 --> 00:14.348
110th, 10-30.
A distress call.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.683
Calvin Franz was murdered.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.059
If he was calling you
for help, he may have been

00:17.059 --> 00:18.686
trying to get in touch
with the rest of the unit.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.396
I called O'Donnell, Dixon,

00:20.396 --> 00:22.148
Sanchez and Orozco.
No one's answering.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.741
I paid off the concierge. He
I.D.'d Neagley as checking in.

00:31.741 --> 00:34.785
Just keep an eye on
that hotel and them.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.036
No one will really
know who you are.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.663
But you know.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.963
Hey, O'Donnell.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.590
Hey, Neagley.

00:48.924 --> 00:49.967
Just a list of names,

00:49.967 --> 00:50.968
all starting
with the initials "A.M."

00:50.968 --> 00:52.428
I just got page after page

00:52.428 --> 00:54.764
of random numbers.
No order, no meaning. Nothing.

00:54.764 --> 00:56.557
At least
to us, for now.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.184
What
are you thinking?

00:58.184 --> 00:59.560
I'm thinking there's
someone hell-bent

00:59.560 --> 01:01.353
on taking out
the special investigators.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.980
And they're coming after us.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.982
Good.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.238
So, if someone's
coming after the 110,

01:11.238 --> 01:13.073
how come they haven't made
a run at the three of us yet?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.617
You were in the woods
with your family,

01:14.617 --> 01:16.952
no one can ever find me
and maybe they just

01:16.952 --> 01:18.454
hadn't gotten around
to Neagley yet.

01:18.454 --> 01:20.122
They were in our hotel rooms,

01:20.122 --> 01:21.957
maybe to grab us or take us out,

01:21.957 --> 01:24.418
but then had to bail
for some reason.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.420
We need to try again
to warn the others.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.880
I'll call Sanchez and Orozco.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.048
I got Dixon.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.466
There's a black sedan
across the street,

01:30.466 --> 01:33.135
couple houses down.
Same one as yesterday.

01:34.637 --> 01:35.930
Guess you were right.

01:35.930 --> 01:39.391
We're being followed.
How you want to play this?

01:39.391 --> 01:41.477
I'm gonna go introduce myself.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.779
Look at this fucking beaut.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.950
What's he think he's gonna do?

02:05.918 --> 02:07.086
Fucking nose, man.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.257
Gun!

02:18.973 --> 02:20.641
Just like the good old days.

02:20.641 --> 02:24.520
Yeah, you on the sidelines
while I do all the work.

02:24.520 --> 02:28.232
Uh, fellas, this was his gun.

02:29.275 --> 02:30.276
NYPD?

02:30.276 --> 02:32.570
Name's Gaitano Russo.

02:35.114 --> 02:37.658
Don't look at me.
You did all the work.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.622
<i>♪ Baby, oh, baby ♪</i>

02:43.622 --> 02:45.875
<i>♪ Boogaloo down Broadway ♪</i>

02:45.875 --> 02:47.167
<i>♪ Broadway, yeah ♪</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:48.752
<i>♪ Funky Broadway ♪</i>

02:48.752 --> 02:50.671
<i>♪ Baby, oh, baby ♪</i>

02:50.671 --> 02:53.966
Got to say, man. Major screwup.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.676
Soon as Russo wakes up,

02:55.676 --> 02:57.928
the entire NYPD's
gonna be after your ass.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.805
Why'd you got to
hit him so hard, huh?

02:59.805 --> 03:01.473
I don't hit soft.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.393
Well, a cop puncher's
gonna do some serious time.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.520
I was pissed about
the dog, and I assumed

03:06.520 --> 03:08.772
he was involved in
killing Franzy and Swan.

03:08.772 --> 03:09.940
What did you teach us?

03:09.940 --> 03:12.151
"In an investigation,
assumptions kill."

03:12.151 --> 03:14.528
No, it was "In an
investigation, details matter".

03:14.528 --> 03:16.864
I didn't kill him,
just broke his nose.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.241
He'll be fine when he wakes up.

03:19.241 --> 03:22.411
Shit. Gaitano Russo.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.830
Guy Russo. He's the
investigating officer

03:24.830 --> 03:27.583
in Franz's homicide.
I saw it in the files.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.752
And how'd he get on your tail?

03:29.752 --> 03:32.004
NYPD saw the calls
Franz made to you,

03:32.004 --> 03:33.672
flagged your name, got an alert

03:33.672 --> 03:34.798
when you bought
the plane tickets,

03:34.798 --> 03:35.799
been on you since you landed.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.426
Question is "why?"

03:37.426 --> 03:39.011
Question is "where?"

03:39.011 --> 03:40.804
As in, where do we hide
a six-foot-five felon

03:40.804 --> 03:42.139
so you don't
wind up in the pokey.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.600
I'm not leaving.
The case is here.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.477
Maybe not.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.395
When I called Sanchez
and Orozco's office,

03:48.395 --> 03:50.648
voice mail was full.
That's a bad sign.

03:50.648 --> 03:52.608
So it might not be a bad time
to get out of Dodge,

03:52.608 --> 03:55.611
considering Cocky Balboa
here just knocked out a lawman.

03:55.611 --> 03:59.031
Fine. We'll head down
to Atlantic City,

03:59.031 --> 04:00.991
see if we can find the guys.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.952
First we got to
check out of our hotel

04:02.952 --> 04:04.370
and find a more generic ride

04:04.370 --> 04:06.121
before Russo
regains consciousness

04:06.121 --> 04:09.625
and puts out a BOLO.
Range Rover's too conspicuous.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.920
You're the reason
we can't have nice things.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.315
Wait, I don't understand.
Was it a car accident?

04:33.315 --> 04:35.192
No, he just kicked the car.

04:35.192 --> 04:39.363
Well, then how the hell
did the airbag go off?

04:39.363 --> 04:40.906
He kicked the car,

04:40.906 --> 04:42.992
then he pulled the cop out
and he knocked

04:42.992 --> 04:44.368
<i>his dick in the dirt.</i>

04:44.368 --> 04:46.286
<i>I'm telling you,
this guy's a beast.</i>

04:46.286 --> 04:48.747
When the time comes,
I'm gonna need some backup.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.291
And you'll get it.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.377
But for now, you just
stay on their asses,

04:53.377 --> 04:55.671
and don't fuck this up.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.464
Understood.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.597
<i>Short-term
airport parking only in Lot 1.</i>

05:06.974 --> 05:09.935
<i>Short-term airport parking
only in Lot 1.</i>

05:11.979 --> 05:14.690
There's a 2019 Accord
for sale up in Tremont

05:14.690 --> 05:17.526
for way under market value.
Cash-only deal.

05:17.526 --> 05:19.069
One of the most stolen
makes and models

05:19.069 --> 05:21.155
for sale in the Bronx, and
the guy wants no paperwork?

05:21.155 --> 05:23.490
We sit in that thing,
we burn our asses.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.868
We don't have a choice.
We're flagged in the system.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.745
We can't rent anything
under our names.

05:27.745 --> 05:28.954
Well, we drive around
in a stolen vehicle,

05:28.954 --> 05:31.040
we risk getting pinched.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.624
I've got our solution.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.306
How was your undercover job?

05:48.682 --> 05:50.142
Reacher.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.104
How'd you know I was undercover?

05:54.104 --> 05:56.690
Considering the circumstances,
you would've come right away.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.983
But you didn't,
which can only mean

05:57.983 --> 05:59.234
you didn't get our
messages until recently.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.153
But if you were on vacation,

06:01.153 --> 06:03.030
you would've checked in
with your office periodically.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.908
So you had to be working
undercover, deep undercover,

06:05.908 --> 06:08.744
where frequent check-ins
aren't always possible.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.746
Same old Reacher.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.790
Corporate embezzlement case.

06:12.790 --> 06:14.291
Stuck in Texas so long,
I started to think

06:14.291 --> 06:17.002
I actually liked cowboy boots
and high school football.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.879
Still got your fake ID with you?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.589
- Yeah.
- Good.

06:20.589 --> 06:21.632
Use it to rent the car.

06:21.632 --> 06:23.217
What's with all the secrecy?

06:23.217 --> 06:25.135
Neagley, O'Donnell and I have
been flagged in the system.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.137
And I punched out a cop.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.140
Of course you did.

06:34.812 --> 06:38.273
So... Franz.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.818
Yeah. And Swan,

06:40.818 --> 06:42.402
most likely.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.197
Sanchez and Orozco are MIA, too.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.618
Okay.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.749
Okay, so we take
care of business.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.335
You do not mess with
the special investigators.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.046
Next.

07:05.843 --> 07:06.802
Make sure you get an...

07:06.802 --> 07:09.304
SUV. I know.
You need the headroom.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.903
Good. Glad to see
you're still here.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.655
Feel like I'm never gonna leave.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.324
If it's reported at any Army
base anywhere in the world,

07:29.324 --> 07:31.451
no matter how minor
the infraction,

07:31.451 --> 07:32.995
we're copied on it.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.956
Well, anything jump out at you?

07:35.956 --> 07:39.126
Yeah, a rat the size of
a honeydew about 20 minutes ago.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.294
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.628
It's back in
those boxes somewhere.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.590
Gross. Well, speaking of rats,

07:44.590 --> 07:46.633
I think I smell one.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.886
A commanding officer
at a base in Afghanistan

07:48.886 --> 07:50.971
thinks someone's
stealing aviation fuel.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.849
Siphoning off gas to
resell it on the side?

07:53.849 --> 07:55.809
Not exactly the kind
of priority case

07:55.809 --> 07:57.477
the Army wants us taking on.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.396
Right, but see, I don't
think anybody's stealing

07:59.396 --> 08:01.690
and reselling anything.
Take a look at these numbers.

08:01.690 --> 08:04.443
They always tell a story.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.528
See, I noticed that
every time fuel went missing

08:06.528 --> 08:09.740
from the base, it was always
after a specific flight.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.784
Whenever C-17s ferried
Humvees back home to the States.

08:12.784 --> 08:14.286
I mean, it's a minor detail,

08:14.286 --> 08:17.164
but in an investigation,
details matter.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.375
I like that.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.252
I'm gonna use it.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.129
What's mine is yours.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.633
So...

08:27.633 --> 08:29.635
you have a theory?

08:29.635 --> 08:32.429
Yeah. There's been no indication
of black market fuel sales

08:32.429 --> 08:34.348
anywhere on or around the base,

08:34.348 --> 08:36.516
so how does all that
fuel go missing?

08:36.516 --> 08:38.602
Best way to make gas
disappear is to burn it up.

08:38.602 --> 08:41.146
Exactly. Now, Neagley's
got the bulk fuel experience

08:41.146 --> 08:42.773
and she thinks all
the Humvee flights

08:42.773 --> 08:44.983
are intentionally
being over-fueled.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.236
But, when those planes land,

08:47.236 --> 08:48.779
the amount of fuel in the tanks

08:48.779 --> 08:50.489
is exactly what's expected,

08:50.489 --> 08:51.907
and that gets
logged into the books.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.784
So, how does that happen?

08:53.784 --> 08:56.745
The excess fuel is being
used to transport more weight

08:56.745 --> 08:58.413
than people realize
is on the plane.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.207
- Yeah.
- Something heavy

09:00.207 --> 09:02.834
and secret is being moved.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.504
Mm-hmm. Exactly.
Contraband in the Humvees.

09:05.504 --> 09:08.882
Drugs, guns, stolen cash,
all of the above.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.135
Good work, Dixon.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.471
You just found a case
worthy of our attention.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.307
I don't know about you,

09:17.307 --> 09:19.685
but all this sleuthing's
made me thirsty.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.728
Want to go celebrate?

09:21.728 --> 09:23.897
You can buy me a drink.

09:26.525 --> 09:29.236
I got to keep working
on these reports.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.447
Maybe next time.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.157
Yeah.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.993
But again,

09:35.993 --> 09:37.202
excellent work, Dixon.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.496
Yeah. No problem.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.249
Like I said, numbers
always tell the story.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.003
<i>♪ Best thing you ever had ♪</i>

09:55.887 --> 09:58.265
<i>♪ Make up your mind ♪</i>

10:00.183 --> 10:03.186
<i>♪ Decide to walk with me ♪</i>

10:05.022 --> 10:08.400
<i>♪ Around the lake tonight ♪</i>

10:09.401 --> 10:10.610
<i>♪ Around...</i>

10:10.610 --> 10:12.821
So, the numbers telling you

10:12.821 --> 10:14.906
a story?

10:16.241 --> 10:18.243
Yeah, and it's
a David Lynch film.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.745
It's totally incomprehensible.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.121
I mean, if these are
supposed to be fractions,

10:21.121 --> 10:23.457
then it's sloppy work.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.875
Some of them
aren't even reduced.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.460
I noticed that, too.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.628
Maybe the numbers
represent hard quantities.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.047
Like, eight out
of ten somethings,

10:30.047 --> 10:32.382
and not just
four-fifths of something?

10:32.382 --> 10:33.717
Maybe.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.677
Yeah, maybe.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.471
Beyond that,
two things stick out.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.139
None of these are 100%, meaning

10:39.139 --> 10:41.558
there's no nine out
of nine or ten out of ten,

10:41.558 --> 10:43.852
and the first four pages
have 26 numbers,

10:43.852 --> 10:47.356
the fifth has 27 and
the last two have 26 again.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.024
Could be an accident.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.567
Just the way
the information's spaced.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.028
No, seems deliberate to me.
None of these pages are full.

10:53.028 --> 10:54.821
What about the list
of A.M. names?

10:54.821 --> 10:56.531
Means nothing to me.
I agree with you guys.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.116
It's got to be an alias.

10:58.116 --> 11:01.203
Maybe it's someone with
a grudge against the 110th?

11:01.203 --> 11:02.996
We've arrested a lot of people.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.248
What about James Barr?

11:05.248 --> 11:07.793
I mean, that guy's got
the skills and a screw loose.

11:07.793 --> 11:10.003
Barr's a shooter.
Can't picture him

11:10.003 --> 11:11.338
throwing someone
out of a helicopter.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.673
Plus, I ran into him
in Indiana last year.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.759
He owes me now.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.721
I don't want to know.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.644
Pine Barrens.

11:25.644 --> 11:28.438
About a million lonely acres.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.066
A lot like the spot
Upstate New York

11:31.066 --> 11:32.859
where they found Franz.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.113
They left his broken body
out there to rot.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.658
For all we know,
Swan's out there, too.

11:40.951 --> 11:43.745
And Sanchez. And Orozco.

11:45.247 --> 11:47.791
<i>♪ Forever ♪</i>

11:47.791 --> 11:49.000

11:51.878 --> 11:54.214
It's from my phone.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.591
Franz used to blast this

12:17.237 --> 12:19.698

12:19.698 --> 12:21.241
She's with them now.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.617
They're headed
towards Atlantic City,

12:22.617 --> 12:24.286
probably gonna try to
find their missing buddies.

12:24.286 --> 12:27.664
Good. All in the same
place at once.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.542
When you get there,
take them out.

12:30.542 --> 12:31.835

12:31.835 --> 12:33.795

about needing backup?

12:33.795 --> 12:35.714
I know some local talent.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.467
Well, bring in whoever you need.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.844
We'll cover the tab.

12:40.844 --> 12:43.889
I just want them
dead by tomorrow.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.765
You hear me?

12:45.765 --> 12:47.726
Fucking dead.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.795
Just like Franz's office.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.131
And our hotel rooms.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.759
You said they hadn't
trashed Swan's place.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.093
Yup.

13:22.093 --> 13:23.261
Add that
to the list of things

13:23.261 --> 13:25.639
that must mean something.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.561
You guys ever know
Orozco to go anywhere

13:31.561 --> 13:32.979
without his lighter?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.359
Better days.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.325
Am I the only one of us
that doesn't have this photo?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.244
- Got mine.
- Got mine.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.578
On my bookshelf.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.374
Hard to hang a picture on your
wall when you don't have walls.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.630
We're wasting our time here.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.423
Agreed. We have
what the killers want,

14:00.423 --> 14:04.094
and anything worth finding,
they already got.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.679
Where to next?

14:05.679 --> 14:07.639
A bar.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.433
Look at these photos
of Sanchez and this woman.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.143
Who under 50 frames photos?

14:12.143 --> 14:13.728
We do.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.939
Other than the 110th, how many
photos you have at your house?

14:15.939 --> 14:17.148
Not many.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.526
But she's framed,
so she's important.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.029
We're going to the Lucky Lounge.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.878
No. You two stay here.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.172
You both look like cops.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.425
What do you two look like?

14:43.425 --> 14:45.176
<i>Lady and the Tramp.</i>

15:08.867 --> 15:09.784
Hey.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.620
This woman working today?

15:12.746 --> 15:13.913
Who are you?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.624
Friends of Jorge Sanchez.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.085
Hey, Dulls.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.047
These guys say
they're friends of Sanchez,

15:22.047 --> 15:23.506
want to talk to Milena.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.425
Take them back to the office.
She's doing the books.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.302

15:50.617 --> 15:53.286

15:53.286 --> 15:55.080
I get that he's
a different kind of guy,

15:55.080 --> 15:58.333
but our commanding officer
buys used underwear.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.297
Isn't that the girl
from the photo?

16:04.297 --> 16:06.007
Oh, shit.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.052
Hey!

16:10.303 --> 16:11.846
This is as far as we're going.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.938
What's going on, fellas?

16:19.938 --> 16:21.481
You guys are gonna
stop coming around here

16:21.481 --> 16:22.482
and messing with our friends.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.901
Look, pal, you somehow got...

16:27.821 --> 16:29.739
Don't touch me!

16:44.546 --> 16:45.630
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

16:50.719 --> 16:51.720
Move your ass.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.139
I'm done, I'm done.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.557
Well, it's a good thing

16:55.557 --> 16:56.808
O'Donnell and I didn't go in.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.893
Something could've gone wrong.

17:03.148 --> 17:05.191
You making friends,
big fella?

17:06.818 --> 17:08.653
I'm so sorry.
I never would've run

17:08.653 --> 17:09.904
if I'd known who you were.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.949
I should've recognized
you from Jorge's photos.

17:12.949 --> 17:16.161
My guys were just
looking out for me.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.663
Scary dude came in here
asking for her about a week ago.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.915
Said he was working
with Sanchez and Orozco

17:20.915 --> 17:22.208
on some big security job.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.835
Broad-shouldered bald guy?

17:23.835 --> 17:25.879
No. He had hair.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.255
Scar down his cheek.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.424
He wanted to know
if Sanchez had left

17:29.424 --> 17:31.634
any kind of digital
storage device

17:31.634 --> 17:32.927
with me. I-I had no idea

17:32.927 --> 17:34.095
what he was talking about.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.805
I got a bad vibe off the guy,

17:35.805 --> 17:38.725
so soon as he left,
I called Jorge.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.477
He didn't answer.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.812
They've gone dark before,
part of the job,

17:42.812 --> 17:46.024
but this... feels different.

17:46.024 --> 17:47.525
Then you come in,
claiming to know Sanchez,

17:47.525 --> 17:49.402
looking like the kind
of people somebody'd hire

17:49.402 --> 17:51.571
to rough someone up. No offense.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.989
Assumed you were bad news.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.616
Do you
know if Sanchez

17:54.616 --> 17:56.284
and Orozco had
any recent contact

17:56.284 --> 17:57.786
with Calvin Franz or Tony Swan?

17:57.786 --> 17:59.788
Actually, yeah. He was
here a couple weeks ago.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.748
They hadn't seen
each other in forever.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.917
I took a picture of them.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.671
They were working
a case together.

18:08.671 --> 18:09.756
Sanchez told you that?

18:09.756 --> 18:10.757
Yeah.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.383
What was it?

18:12.383 --> 18:13.635
He didn't mention details.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.011
Was Swan involved?

18:16.179 --> 18:17.305
He didn't come down to A.C.,

18:17.305 --> 18:20.517
but I heard them
mention his name.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.727
You tried asking
Franz about this?

18:22.727 --> 18:24.562
- We can't.
- Why not?

18:24.562 --> 18:26.439
Someone threw him
out of a helicopter.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.986
Oh, my God.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.033
You think Jorge and
Manuel are dead, too?

18:37.992 --> 18:39.911
We don't know yet.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.871
If they're alive,
we'll find them,

18:41.871 --> 18:43.206
but we need your help.

18:43.206 --> 18:45.875
Is there anything else
you can recall

18:45.875 --> 18:47.460
that you haven't told us?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.796
Um...

18:49.796 --> 18:51.506
I don't know.

18:52.841 --> 18:54.259
Last time I saw Jorge,

18:54.259 --> 18:56.302
he was sitting on
that stool right there.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.098
He got a call.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.432
Seemed important.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.809
He say anything?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.519
Kind of. He-he repeated
a couple of numbers,

19:04.519 --> 19:06.896
kind of like he was
surprised by them,

19:06.896 --> 19:09.232
or-or worried, maybe.

19:09.232 --> 19:10.692
Then he said he
was going out for a while,

19:10.692 --> 19:11.943
and he never came back.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.403
Do you remember the numbers?

19:13.403 --> 19:16.197
Yeah. He said,

19:16.197 --> 19:18.616
"650 at 100k each."

19:18.616 --> 19:19.826
No idea what he meant by that.

19:19.826 --> 19:20.994
You're sure that's what he said?

19:20.994 --> 19:24.539
I'm positive.
He said, "650 at 100k,"

19:24.539 --> 19:26.875
he kissed me on the cheek

19:26.875 --> 19:28.710
and he ran out that door.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.591
You remember the last words
someone you love said to you.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.677
<i>♪ Oh, darling ♪</i>

19:39.429 --> 19:43.308
<i>♪ I need you close to me ♪</i>

19:45.393 --> 19:47.562
We've got the numbers,
we've got the New York plates.

19:47.562 --> 19:50.899
Maybe this isn't about someone
with a grudge against the 110th.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.358
If you haven't noticed,
it's pretty likely

19:52.358 --> 19:53.943
four of us have already
been killed already.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.612
Milena said Franz was
here a couple weeks ago.

19:55.612 --> 19:56.946
If the guys were onto something

19:56.946 --> 19:58.573
that made them think
we were all in danger,

19:58.573 --> 20:00.992
they would've called then,
not weeks later.

20:00.992 --> 20:04.037
650 at 100k, we're
talking 65 million bucks.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.496
That's a lot of black chips.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.624
Most places. Not here.

20:07.624 --> 20:11.169
Atlantic City casinos
rake in, what?

20:11.169 --> 20:13.922
Gross gaming revenue's got to be
a couple billion a year, easy.

20:13.922 --> 20:16.424
65 million, if taken carefully,

20:16.424 --> 20:19.302
over time, could go
unnoticed for a while.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.887
Not that long.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.014
Not with casino accountants
watching the take like hawks.

20:23.014 --> 20:24.807
But could the bad guys
hide it in the margins

20:24.807 --> 20:26.059
long enough to get away with it

20:26.059 --> 20:27.727
before the calculator
crew catches on?

20:27.727 --> 20:30.396
Sanchez and Orozco do
freelance casino security.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.065
I mean, maybe it all
started with them.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.525
They stumbled onto something
big, they needed help...

20:34.525 --> 20:37.570
So they reached out
to Franz... maybe Swan.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.199
Guess this whole thing
could be tied to gaming.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.618
I'm Ellie, I'll be your server.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.036
What can I get you?

20:45.036 --> 20:46.496
The casino's director
of security.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.291
Now, please.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.044
So, you're the 110th.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.587
What's left of us.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.382
Sanchez and Orozco talk
about you guys all the time.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.925
Please.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.218
So, you knew them well?

21:00.218 --> 21:02.387
Uh, yeah. They would do
background checks

21:02.387 --> 21:04.138
for all the casinos
on the boardwalk.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.600
Hold on. Uh, you just
said "knew them."

21:07.600 --> 21:09.686
Past tense.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.521
We have reason to
believe they might be dead.

21:12.563 --> 21:15.108
Oh, shit.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.276
I-I just saw them,

21:17.276 --> 21:20.947
uh, while I was picking up lunch
at White House Subs last month.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.323
How can I help?

21:22.323 --> 21:23.825
These numbers mean
anything to you?

21:25.201 --> 21:26.411
Not offhand.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.871
What about the phrase,
"650 at 100k each"?

21:28.871 --> 21:32.458
No. Uh, what's this all about?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.836
We think Sanchez and Orozco

21:34.836 --> 21:38.131
may have been looking into
a $65 million gambling scam.

21:38.131 --> 21:41.551
Okay. Uh, well, in that case,

21:41.551 --> 21:44.679
your "650" could be
rigged slot machines

21:44.679 --> 21:47.974
or fixed hands of poker,
but at 100k per hand,

21:47.974 --> 21:50.393
that'd be incredibly
high stakes.

21:50.393 --> 21:54.439
And I can tell you right now,
our books are on mark.

21:54.439 --> 21:56.149
All right? We're not
missing a penny.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.650
What about your competitors?

21:57.650 --> 22:00.403
You know, I can...
I can ask around,

22:00.403 --> 22:03.740
see if anyone knew what Sanchez
and Orozco were working on.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.075
That might
narrow it down for you.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.535
While you're at it,
run these names,

22:07.535 --> 22:09.454
see if any of them are
registered at a hotel in town.

22:12.081 --> 22:16.169
Uh... you know, this-this
might take a few hours.

22:16.169 --> 22:17.670
Where are you guys staying?

22:17.670 --> 22:19.756
Don't know yet.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.842
Well, then, please, allow me.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.135
Not necessary.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.721
No, no. Any friends
of Sanchez and Orozco.

22:26.721 --> 22:29.057
Well, it looks like

22:29.057 --> 22:31.309
all we have available
is a suite.

22:31.309 --> 22:33.227
I guess that'll have to do.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.688
Come on, I'll get
you guys settled in.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.273
We'll be fine at a motel.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.650
Reacher, when someone offers

22:39.650 --> 22:42.612
to comp you a suite,
just say yes.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.697
Yeah. We'll have them send you
up a park bench to sleep on.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.407
You'll feel right at home.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.715
What was that
about a motel, Reacher?

23:04.550 --> 23:07.762
Whoa.
I bet this place has a spa.

23:07.762 --> 23:09.388
I'm gonna take a schvitz.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.599
Ooh. Dibs on the ocean view.

23:11.599 --> 23:16.270
<i>♪ Just waiting for you to
tell me it's time ♪</i>

23:18.481 --> 23:21.734
<i>♪ I've been keeping
my head well-trained ♪</i>

23:21.734 --> 23:24.654
<i>♪ Watching truth come

23:24.654 --> 23:29.909

23:29.909 --> 23:31.911
<i>♪ Oh, tell me it's time ♪</i>

23:31.911 --> 23:37.041

23:37.041 --> 23:39.710
<i>♪ Tell me it's time ♪</i>

23:39.710 --> 23:42.130
<i>♪ Time, time ♪</i>

23:42.130 --> 23:44.382
O'Donnell and Neagley
found the bar.

23:44.382 --> 23:47.677
It's fully stocked.
Not for long.

23:47.677 --> 23:49.178
You unpacked?

23:52.181 --> 23:53.850
Yup.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.900
I haven't
been in a hotel

24:02.900 --> 24:05.069
that wasn't advertised as
"family friendly" in years.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.362
I still
can't believe

24:06.362 --> 24:08.406
David O'Donnell procreated.

24:08.406 --> 24:10.992
On purpose, anyway.

24:10.992 --> 24:13.077
Yeah, I seem to remember
someone bragging

24:13.077 --> 24:14.787
that the only people
that would call you Daddy

24:14.787 --> 24:16.080
were the women you slept with.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.791
I still sleep with
people who call me Daddy.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.252
Sometimes all three of them
if it's thundering outside.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.297
You'll find out soon
enough, Dixon.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.381
You're pregnant?

24:25.381 --> 24:27.550
What? No. Shit no.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.343
No, she's engaged.

24:29.343 --> 24:30.970
What, you didn't know?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.681
Someone finally lassoed
our little filly.

24:33.681 --> 24:37.435
No, I, um, didn't...

24:37.435 --> 24:38.728
Yeah. Well, about that,

24:38.728 --> 24:41.355
you guys can,
uh, unsave the date.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.733
Fuck. Seriously?

24:44.942 --> 24:46.819
Yeah, I mean, you know me.
I've always been a numbers gal,

24:46.819 --> 24:48.821
always had a life plan.

24:48.821 --> 24:52.700
Plan said to get married at
a certain age, certain year.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.119
And then one day, I see text
messages on his phone.

24:55.119 --> 24:58.873
It says, "Hey, sweetheart,
can't wait to see you Friday.

24:58.873 --> 25:00.041
I miss you." And all of that.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.959
No. No one steps out on Dixon.

25:01.959 --> 25:03.586
Not even
him, apparently.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.379
Text messages
were from his niece

25:05.379 --> 25:06.756
who was visiting.

25:06.756 --> 25:09.050
But I realized

25:09.050 --> 25:12.470
that when I thought
he was cheating,

25:12.470 --> 25:14.013
I was, uh...

25:15.431 --> 25:16.891
I was relieved.

25:16.891 --> 25:19.060
I mean, he's a decent man.

25:19.060 --> 25:21.062
I... I don't know,
if you're gonna spend

25:21.062 --> 25:22.396
the rest of your life with
somebody, don't you want to

25:22.396 --> 25:24.523
feel something more
than comfort?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.359
I mean, don't you want
to feel excitement,

25:26.359 --> 25:28.778
a little jolt of something

25:28.778 --> 25:30.529
when you see him?

25:32.740 --> 25:34.158
Anyways, you know, for a moment

25:34.158 --> 25:36.494
I thought I was gonna get out
of it with no mess and no guilt,

25:36.494 --> 25:38.704
but instead, I got
out of it with...

25:38.704 --> 25:41.207
A lot of mess and
a whole lot of guilt.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.959
Bingo.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.752
Good for you.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.170
Karla Dixon doesn't settle.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.297
Thank you.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.508
That's actually why
I took the undercover job.

25:50.508 --> 25:53.010
Take a little time
away from it all.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.137
Explain to me how
undercover work

25:55.137 --> 25:56.806
and forensic
accounting go together?

25:56.806 --> 25:59.517
Well, um, CEO
embezzling millions

25:59.517 --> 26:01.227
from a company down in Texas,

26:01.227 --> 26:02.979
where everybody's packing
some kind of heat,

26:02.979 --> 26:04.563
and he was the kind
of guy to use it if cornered,

26:04.563 --> 26:08.442
so got a little intrigue along
with the number-crunching.

26:08.442 --> 26:11.195
All right. And what
about you, Neagley?

26:11.195 --> 26:13.406
Every time I check my LinkedIn,

26:13.406 --> 26:14.573
you're getting promoted again.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.825
I'm having fun.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.952
On big cases,
running a team now.

26:17.952 --> 26:20.705
Trying to land this huge
software company as a client.

26:20.705 --> 26:23.749
I pull it off, I get a taste
of that fat contract.

26:23.749 --> 26:24.834
Making it rain.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.419
No choice.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.296
I really want to get my dad
on round-the-clock nursing care

26:28.296 --> 26:30.965
and rent him a nice place closer
to me, but that takes capital.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.842
Why rent?
Buy and build equity.

26:32.842 --> 26:34.760
Get a condo.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.929
Co-ops are fucking
banana republics.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.307
Yeah.

26:39.307 --> 26:41.225
What about you, big dog?

26:41.225 --> 26:43.477
Being awfully quiet over there.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.106
Home ownership is like
keeping snakes as pets

26:47.106 --> 26:49.150
or ballroom
dancing competitions.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.901
Fine, if that's
what you're into.

26:50.901 --> 26:53.362
I just don't see the appeal.

26:53.362 --> 26:54.947
Or the appeal of a steady job.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.158
Corporate world doesn't
seem that different

26:57.158 --> 26:59.952
from the Army, and that always
felt a little like a cage.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.829
Just didn't know anything else.

27:02.872 --> 27:06.000
Then one day I was in a bar,
and someone plays Howlin' Wolf

27:06.000 --> 27:08.544
singing about trains
going by in the night.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.130
That sounded like
real freedom to me.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.967
Are you jumping on freight
trains like Boxcar Willie?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.761
Sometimes.

27:16.761 --> 27:18.637
Mostly I take buses
or hitchhike.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.514
What kind of lunatic

27:20.514 --> 27:22.683
is picking up the world's
biggest drifter?

27:22.683 --> 27:24.727
They can be interesting.

27:24.727 --> 27:26.103
Where do you eat?

27:26.103 --> 27:27.521
I steal pie off windowsills.

27:27.521 --> 27:29.231
I'm being serious.

27:29.231 --> 27:32.401
Diners. Sometimes
people who pick me up

27:32.401 --> 27:34.070
share a meal with me.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.988
Sometimes I share with them.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.782
Where do you sleep?

27:37.782 --> 27:40.242
Cheap motels mostly.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.619
And what if you can't find one?

27:41.619 --> 27:44.330
Unattended boats in marinas
are good for a night.

27:44.330 --> 27:45.998
Flatbeds of parked trucks.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.417
Had a great night's
sleep in a hammock

27:48.417 --> 27:50.002
I spotted in some
guy's backyard once

27:50.002 --> 27:51.253
till the sprinklers went off.

27:51.253 --> 27:52.922
Good God, man.

27:52.922 --> 27:54.715
All you need is
a stick and a bindle.

27:54.715 --> 27:57.218
Too much luggage.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.805
Any more questions?

28:00.805 --> 28:01.806
Yeah,

28:01.806 --> 28:03.432
just one.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.519
Don't you ever get lonely?

28:29.834 --> 28:31.335
Looks like someone took the sign

28:31.335 --> 28:33.129
as a personal challenge.

28:33.129 --> 28:34.922
Doreen, I'm just warming up.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.466
<i>If you
liked the dinner,</i>

28:37.466 --> 28:40.302
<i>make sure to try
Neptune's breakfast buffet.</i>

28:40.302 --> 28:42.888
<i>Every day, starting at 6:00 a.m.</i>

28:42.888 --> 28:44.723
Thank you.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.086
Looks like I'm not the only
one who couldn't sleep.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.504
Numbers relax me.

29:15.504 --> 29:16.797
Figured if I was gonna do math,

29:16.797 --> 29:18.799
I might as well make
some walking-around money.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.509
- Stand.
- Ma'am, you're showing ten

29:20.509 --> 29:21.635
and eight on two of your hands.

29:21.635 --> 29:23.721
That's right.
And I could double down

29:23.721 --> 29:25.139
and risk it all
for a potentially

29:25.139 --> 29:27.057
larger payout.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.393
Or I could stand
and have a guaranteed win

29:29.393 --> 29:31.687
because the next card out
of that shoe is gonna bust you.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.564
My grandmother always said,
pigs get fat,

29:33.564 --> 29:34.773
hogs get slaughtered.

29:34.773 --> 29:35.900
She's no hog.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.568
I'm no hog,

29:37.568 --> 29:38.611
so I'm gonna stand.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.738
As you wish. 15...

29:42.239 --> 29:43.699
Too many.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.659
Congratulations, ma'am.

29:45.659 --> 29:47.661
You're having
a very lucky night.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.872
Maybe you'd like to celebrate
with a concert on us?

29:49.872 --> 29:51.165
Thank you.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.459
Ladies of the '80s.
Debbie Gibson, Tiffany,

29:53.459 --> 29:55.127
and Taylor Dane performing
their biggest hits.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.837
If you hurry, you can
actually catch the second half.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.339
But I'm having fun.

29:59.507 --> 30:01.258
Ma'am, we know
you're counting cards.

30:01.258 --> 30:03.427
Which isn't illegal if
you do it in your head.

30:03.427 --> 30:06.138
But seeing that
your chief of security

30:06.138 --> 30:07.473
was kind enough
to comp us a suite,

30:07.473 --> 30:09.141
I'll cut you some slack.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.643
Want to use those muscles

30:10.643 --> 30:13.270
and help me carry these
to the cashier window?

30:13.270 --> 30:15.439
And you can give these tickets

30:15.439 --> 30:16.774
to the guy in
the Members Only jacket.

30:16.774 --> 30:19.985
He looks like he would
enjoy some '80s ladies.

30:45.636 --> 30:47.263
Thanks for coming with.

30:47.263 --> 30:49.431
Late-night walks
always clear my head,

30:49.431 --> 30:52.935
and after the text I got
from Neagley about Franz,

30:52.935 --> 30:55.521
my head's been kind
of cloudy, you know?

30:55.521 --> 30:56.939
Yeah.

30:56.939 --> 30:58.607
I'm surprised you
can walk at all

30:58.607 --> 31:00.109
with all the casino's
money in your pockets.

31:02.069 --> 31:03.654
Can I assume the
forensic accountant's

31:03.654 --> 31:05.573
gonna declare that
cash on her taxes?

31:05.573 --> 31:07.199
Those crooks?

31:07.199 --> 31:08.867
If there's anybody
I could audit...

31:08.867 --> 31:11.287
Actually, it's kind of
my dream job.

31:11.287 --> 31:13.414
Current gig doesn't
give you your auditing fix?

31:13.414 --> 31:14.707
No, I'm just
busting millionaires

31:14.707 --> 31:16.250
from stealing from billionaires.

31:16.250 --> 31:17.585
What I really want to do

31:17.585 --> 31:19.962
is go after government
corruption and waste.

31:19.962 --> 31:21.589
Oh, you used to
work for Uncle Sam.

31:21.589 --> 31:22.756
You know what I'm talking about.

31:22.756 --> 31:24.216
$600 toilet seats.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.761
Exactly. I mean, if tax
money was spent efficiently,

31:27.761 --> 31:31.557
honestly, we could fix
roads and bridges and schools.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.559
Like, we could help people
who actually need help.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.686
We could make a difference.

31:35.686 --> 31:37.146
You should do it.

31:37.146 --> 31:39.231
Yeah.
Well, I looked into

31:39.231 --> 31:41.692
starting my own
nonprofit watchdog group,

31:41.692 --> 31:44.903
but start-up costs
are prohibitive.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.324
First step's always the hardest.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.994
Yeah.

31:51.994 --> 31:55.247
Is that why, back in the day,

31:55.247 --> 31:56.707
you and I never happened?

31:56.707 --> 31:59.043
First steps were the hardest?

32:01.795 --> 32:03.547
How much did you drink
back at the hotel room?

32:03.547 --> 32:06.133
Enough to ask
you that question.

32:07.468 --> 32:08.385
I mean, come on, Reacher.

32:08.385 --> 32:09.928
It's not like
I didn't drop any hints.

32:12.723 --> 32:16.268
I was your boss.
It wouldn't have been right.

32:20.898 --> 32:23.817
Wow. [sighs] Well, I waited
years for that answer,

32:23.817 --> 32:26.278
and it's pure Reacher.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.365
Direct, honest
and well-reasoned.

32:33.577 --> 32:35.663
So, can I ask you
another question?

32:37.623 --> 32:38.624
What do you want to do about

32:38.624 --> 32:40.376
the two guys
that are following us?

32:41.960 --> 32:42.920
When'd you spot them?

32:42.920 --> 32:44.797
Ooh, when we left the casino.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.215
Figure they saw us cashing out

32:46.215 --> 32:47.716
and now they're
gonna try to rob us.

32:47.716 --> 32:49.134
That's what I thought, too.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.386
But see that car

32:50.386 --> 32:52.096
parked up the street with
the New York dealer tags?

32:52.096 --> 32:53.389
Yeah.

32:53.389 --> 32:54.890
Pretty sure it was
behind us on the expressway

32:54.890 --> 32:56.016
when we came into town.

32:56.016 --> 32:58.143
Also, pretty sure
when we walk by it,

32:58.143 --> 32:59.812
a man with a gun will step out.

32:59.812 --> 33:01.105
Then, when we turn to run,

33:01.105 --> 33:03.273
the guys behind us won't
be so far behind anymore.

33:03.273 --> 33:04.900
So what's the plan?

33:04.900 --> 33:06.985
We're not gonna
walk by that car.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.404
On my "go," over the fence.

33:09.446 --> 33:10.698
Go.

33:10.698 --> 33:12.074
Fuck.

33:19.164 --> 33:20.499
Go, go.

33:24.128 --> 33:26.130
Okay, there's got to be
a warrant out for you

33:26.130 --> 33:27.464
in New York
for hitting that cop.

33:27.464 --> 33:29.091
We open fire
in a residential area,

33:29.091 --> 33:31.135
cops get called,
you get locked up.

33:31.135 --> 33:32.511
Let's do this without guns.

33:33.595 --> 33:34.805
Looks like they
have the same idea.

33:37.433 --> 33:38.684
Need help with yours?

33:38.684 --> 33:40.185
I'll manage.

35:08.524 --> 35:09.817
Aah!

35:55.988 --> 35:57.114
Aah!

36:33.108 --> 36:34.443
Damn, Reacher.
When we were kids,

36:34.443 --> 36:35.777
we just wrote our names in it.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.949
It's the Members Only
jacket guy from

36:40.949 --> 36:42.451
the casino.

36:42.451 --> 36:43.744
Oh, shit.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.370
If they went after us,
they might go after

36:45.370 --> 36:46.496
Neagley and O'Donnell, too.

36:46.496 --> 36:48.123
No, they waited

36:48.123 --> 36:50.584
until we were off the boardwalk
to make their move.

36:50.584 --> 36:52.085
They're not gonna go
into a busy hotel

36:52.085 --> 36:53.587
with cameras everywhere.

36:53.587 --> 36:56.340
No I.D.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.133
Let's search this asshole's car.

37:12.147 --> 37:14.024
Looks like someone
did their homework.

37:17.277 --> 37:18.820
Phone.

37:26.328 --> 37:27.704
<i>Is it done?</i>

37:27.704 --> 37:29.331
Not in the way you expected.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.339
You're fucking with
the wrong guy, Reacher.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.925
You should know that this
doesn't end well for you.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.344
<i>Then why are you
the one that sounds scared?</i>

37:45.472 --> 37:48.100
Think I got his attention.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.935
Should we trace the number?

37:49.935 --> 37:51.645
This is a burner.

37:51.645 --> 37:54.314
Guy on the other end
will be using a burner, too.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.108
Dealer tags are
most likely ghost plates,

37:56.108 --> 37:58.068
VIN's been scratched off.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.778
Nothing to I.D. any of them.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.239
These guys are pros.

38:02.239 --> 38:04.282
We should've
left one of them alive.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.369
Yeah, but they didn't give us
much of a choice, did they?

38:07.369 --> 38:09.705
Maybe not.
Now we have nothing to go on.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.625
Not necessarily.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.877
Parking lot pass.

38:16.920 --> 38:18.463
"New Age Technologies."

38:18.463 --> 38:20.632
- Yeah.
- Stamped yesterday morning.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.342
I think it's
what you call a clue.

38:24.678 --> 38:26.763
Now what are we gonna
do about those bodies?

38:28.473 --> 38:29.516
I have an idea.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.991
I'm thirsty. Want to get a beer?

39:03.925 --> 39:05.677
Anything on New Age?

39:05.677 --> 39:08.138
Yeah, looks like New Age

39:08.138 --> 39:10.307
is an aerospace company.

39:10.307 --> 39:12.809
Any ties to Atlantic City?

39:12.809 --> 39:14.978
Not that I can see.

39:14.978 --> 39:17.314
Headquarters are
based in New York.

39:21.818 --> 39:23.653
Looks like a piece
of shrapnel bit me.

39:23.653 --> 39:26.198
I didn't notice with all
the adrenaline pumping.

39:26.198 --> 39:28.617
Barely winged you.

39:28.617 --> 39:29.951
Here.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.711
What you doing?

39:39.711 --> 39:42.339
What my mom used to do
when the alcohol stung.

39:42.339 --> 39:45.008
Mm. You know,
you're probably just

39:45.008 --> 39:46.635
blowing germs into it.

39:46.635 --> 39:48.720
Probably.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.597
But it feels good.

39:54.101 --> 39:56.019
Thanks.

39:58.230 --> 39:59.648
Welcome.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.909
You know, Reacher,

40:10.909 --> 40:14.204
it's perfectly normal
to be lonely sometimes.

40:15.372 --> 40:18.333
Anyone living their life
the way you do would.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.546
But you don't have
to be lonely tonight.

40:25.632 --> 40:28.051
And you're not my boss anymore.

41:29.779 --> 41:32.199
All 650 will be in the truck.

41:32.199 --> 41:33.825
You can track the shipment
with the GPS locater

41:33.825 --> 41:35.368
I paired to this.

41:35.368 --> 41:38.205
There are at least
two good ambush points

41:38.205 --> 41:41.208
- marked on the route.
- Excellent.

41:41.208 --> 41:43.251
My men will take care
of the rest.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.879
And the weapons?

41:45.879 --> 41:48.340
They'll all be used overseas?
I was told that was the deal.

41:48.340 --> 41:50.217
Absolutely.

41:50.217 --> 41:53.803
And the, and the truck driver
won't be harmed?

41:53.803 --> 41:56.473
Of course.

41:56.473 --> 41:58.767
I would never harm anyone.

42:16.368 --> 42:17.869
Morning, Dixon.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.496
We need to talk to you
about what happened last night.

42:19.496 --> 42:21.957
Oh, the whole hotel heard
what happened last night.

42:21.957 --> 42:23.667
Told you you were loud.

42:23.667 --> 42:25.669
Found this in a car
that followed us down

42:25.669 --> 42:27.420
- from New York yesterday.
- What happened

42:27.420 --> 42:28.421
to the driver?

42:28.421 --> 42:30.840
He won't be following us back.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.426
Neither will his two friends.

42:33.426 --> 42:35.512
Shit.

42:38.139 --> 42:39.641
Who is it?

42:39.641 --> 42:41.142
Wright.

42:43.019 --> 42:44.771
Clear.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.273
Come on in.

42:48.233 --> 42:50.902
You, uh, you folks
seem a little jumpy.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.905
I mean, I don't blame you,
given the circumstances.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.241
And I hate to be
the bearer of more bad news,

42:56.241 --> 42:58.368
but when I was
looking into things,

42:58.368 --> 43:00.787
Atlantic City PD told me
that two more bodies

43:00.787 --> 43:03.039
have been discovered
in Upstate New York,

43:03.039 --> 43:05.583
near where they found
your other friend.

43:05.583 --> 43:09.170
Judging by the decomposition,
they'd been there a while.

43:09.170 --> 43:11.381
Got a copy of the police report
for you.

43:16.845 --> 43:19.180
Pretty easy to I.D. him
with that.

43:31.860 --> 43:33.737
When he joined the Army,
his sister was terrified

43:33.737 --> 43:37.032
he'd be killed
with some disfiguring wounds.

43:37.032 --> 43:38.992
She'd never know
what happened to him.

43:38.992 --> 43:42.704
Said his dog tags
could be blown off.

43:42.704 --> 43:44.914
To calm her down, he got
his name and service number

43:44.914 --> 43:47.709
tattooed across his back.

43:47.709 --> 43:50.170
Looked ridiculous.

43:50.170 --> 43:51.796
He didn't care.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.382
He loved his sister.

43:54.382 --> 43:57.177
I'm gonna have to call her.

43:57.177 --> 43:59.220
I'll tell Milena about Jorge.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.473
Their wounds
match Franzy's.

44:01.473 --> 44:04.559
Meaning he was tortured
and tossed out of a helicopter.

44:06.144 --> 44:07.937
Uh, one other thing.

44:07.937 --> 44:12.317
Um, no one using
any of the names you gave me

44:12.317 --> 44:14.235
have checked into
any of the hotels in town.

44:14.235 --> 44:17.197
And I talked to my counterparts
at the other casinos.

44:17.197 --> 44:18.948
Orozco and Sanchez,

44:18.948 --> 44:21.242
they weren't working
on anything for any of them.

44:21.242 --> 44:25.455
And when I told them about
the $65 million gambling scam,

44:25.455 --> 44:26.831
they pulled
their overnight audits.

44:26.831 --> 44:28.291
I did, too.

44:28.291 --> 44:32.545
Everything is within
acceptable loss margins.

44:32.545 --> 44:35.006
No one has hit
any of the casinos.

44:35.006 --> 44:36.007
You don't have anything
to worry about.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.300
Bodies were found in New York,

44:37.300 --> 44:39.386
car that followed us
was from New York.

44:39.386 --> 44:42.097
New York ghost tags,
New York parking pass.

44:42.097 --> 44:44.015
This has always been
a New York case.

44:51.189 --> 44:53.024
Where the hell are you going?

44:54.692 --> 44:57.570
