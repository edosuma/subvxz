-It sounds like...
-A pathologic fracture.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.913
-Cord involvement, I know.
-We got you.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.707
IRVING:
On my count.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.250
One, two, three.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.964
Mrs. Austin, can you feel this?

10:31.047 --> 10:32.048
Just a little.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.258
Barely.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.510
AJ, the cancer-- it's coming back.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.512
No, Mom, we don't know that.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.098
-(monitor beeping)
-She's hypertensive in the 180s.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.267
FAST is negative.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.351
But I still want to rule out

10:43.435 --> 10:44.519
an aortic dissection.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.895
Yeah. I mean, that-that could be the cause

10:45.979 --> 10:47.355
of the symptoms we're seeing.

10:47.439 --> 10:49.149
All right, let's get her to Imaging, stat.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.608
What's happening?

10:50.692 --> 10:53.278
Mom, we're gonna figure that out.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.779
I'm gonna call Dad.

10:54.863 --> 10:57.949
No, no, don't ruin his family reunion.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.577
He's gonna want to fly back, all right?

11:04.581 --> 11:08.001
AJ, listen, we're gonna
do everything we can.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.304
-(Nic chuckles)
-KYLE: Giorgiana Grace.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.472
And look at her.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.309
She has a golden aura.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.144
Mm, a golden aura?

11:26.227 --> 11:28.730
-Gonna remember that one.
-(Nic and Conrad chuckle)

11:28.813 --> 11:31.191
-I think she has my eyes.
-CONRAD: Oh.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.610
She's gonna love her grandpa
something fierce.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.070
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure of that.

11:35.153 --> 11:38.990
Won't I, little angel, Giorgiana Grace?

11:39.074 --> 11:42.660
Sounds so strange
to say that name again. Grace.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.249
I wonder if she's gonna
be like your mother.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.919
Confident and optimistic.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.004
She was the backbone of our family.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.465
The truth is

11:55.548 --> 11:58.718
my life fell apart after I lost her.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.178
She was my rock.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.097
Without her, I was adrift.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.723
I miss her too.

12:03.807 --> 12:07.352
I often thought about how hard it was

12:07.435 --> 12:10.730
for me and Jesse to lose Mom, but...

12:10.814 --> 12:13.483
I never really thought about
how hard it was for you.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.152
Well, I think

12:16.236 --> 12:18.488
our little angel here

12:18.571 --> 12:21.741
has come to heal us, huh?

12:21.825 --> 12:24.661
To make us whole again.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.997
I'm going to be a good grandpa.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.793
-No, I am gonna be a great grandpa. I'm gon...
-(phone dings)

12:31.876 --> 12:34.713
I'm gonna make up for all the...

12:34.796 --> 12:36.965
all the times I let you down.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.719
You have my word on it.

12:40.802 --> 12:44.055
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you, too.

12:44.139 --> 12:47.392
My dad just texted. I'm gonna go meet him.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.810
Give the three of you some time alone.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.028
(TV announcer speaking indistinctly)

13:00.113 --> 13:01.531
Roland.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.743
This is the great Dr. Bell.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.454
BELL:
Nice to meet you, Mr. Rawlins.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.164
Yeah, nice.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.666
Yeah, I met Roland at the Chatter House

13:11.750 --> 13:12.751
when I did a set there.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.169
He plays there every Saturday night.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.005
Uh, except when he's touring.
Now, believe me, Roland

13:17.088 --> 13:18.590
is the best blues guitarist in Georgia,

13:18.673 --> 13:20.175
in my humble opinion.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.635
Yeah, no, of cour... I... I-I saw you.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.512
Couple years ago.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.473
Robert Johnson's "Preachin' Blues."

13:26.556 --> 13:30.602
It's got that, yeah, that just
epic slide guitar lick in it.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.188
Well, you heard me play
"Up Jumped the Devil"?

13:33.271 --> 13:35.732
Yeah, "The blues
is a lowdown shakin' chill."

13:35.815 --> 13:37.776
Well, If you ain't never had 'em,

13:37.859 --> 13:38.902
I hope you never will.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.613
That's the God's truth.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.990
The blues life put me
in this hospital bed.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.618
I didn't treat my body like a temple,

13:46.701 --> 13:48.078
and I'm paying the price.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.163
Well, you mind if I do a quick assessment?

13:50.246 --> 13:51.456
Sure.

13:51.539 --> 13:55.418
Yeah, uh, Roland's liver is cirrhotic.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.672
He's on the UNOS transplant wait list,

13:58.755 --> 14:02.175
but it could be years
until he gets, uh, a liver.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.514
Okay.
I'll be right back.

14:07.597 --> 14:08.807
Oh...

14:08.890 --> 14:11.559
what day of the week is this?

14:11.643 --> 14:13.687
Thursday.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.356
Thank you.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.696
-So, it's-it's Sunday.
-Yeah.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.907
Confusion, ascites.
This is all a result of his cirrhosis.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.826
You can't fix it without a transplant.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.327
It's tragic.
He's an amazing guy.

14:29.411 --> 14:30.787
Beat all his demons,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.498
-but it might be too late?
-No.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.709
Without a new liver
he's not gonna last long.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.461
I'll get into this right away.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.547
All right, thanks.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.556
So, first, the good news.

14:49.639 --> 14:52.600
The scans showed no new metastases.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.812
That means the targeted therapy
is still working.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.772
-The cancer hasn't come back
-Thank God.

14:58.857 --> 15:02.402
But what's happening to me, AJ?

15:02.485 --> 15:04.404
Well, you had a tumor on your spine.

15:04.487 --> 15:06.489
The drug therapy got rid of it,

15:06.573 --> 15:09.200
but it left the bone weakened,

15:09.284 --> 15:11.578
and your spine fractured.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.790
I have a broken back?

15:15.874 --> 15:17.334
In a manner of speaking.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.878
But we're going to get you
steroids to reduce the swelling,

15:19.961 --> 15:21.671
put you in a brace.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.591
But those are only temporary fixes.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.386
You're gonna have to have neurosurgery

15:28.470 --> 15:30.638
-to stabilize your spine.
-My God.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.600
Back surgery.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.394
That is terrifying.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.355
It's... it's gonna be complex.

15:38.438 --> 15:43.068
But I am going to give you
the best surgeon.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.570
Okay?
You can trust me on that.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.830
So, what's the haps, Dr. Pravesh?

15:55.914 --> 15:58.291
You, uh, know the inner secrets
of my body yet?

15:58.375 --> 15:59.959
(Devon laughs)

16:00.043 --> 16:01.461
That was the plan.

16:01.544 --> 16:04.089
This is your cardiac imaging.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.466
And that right there
is the starry sky pattern.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.343
And what's lit up
are the abnormal proteins

16:08.426 --> 16:09.886
in your heart muscle.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.055
-Amyloidosis.
-And with amyloidosis,

16:12.138 --> 16:14.265
the misfolded proteins
wind up in your heart

16:14.349 --> 16:15.892
and make it hard for it to pump.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.603
LEELA: They can accumulate
in other organs as well,

16:18.687 --> 16:22.482
like your kidneys and your nerves,
causing your pain.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.193
And it's why your bicep tendon
got weak and ruptured.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.277
-It's also what caused...
-My Popeye gun.

16:26.361 --> 16:29.781
And your palpitations.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.074
It used to be considered rare,
but not anymore.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.075
Just misdiagnosed.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.577
Okay, so, why is it happening?

16:34.661 --> 16:37.330
Your condition is caused by your liver,

16:37.414 --> 16:40.166
which keeps pumping out the bad proteins.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.711
To cure it, you need a liver transplant.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.594
(Conrad laughing)

16:51.678 --> 16:53.304
Hello, Dad.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.890
Hello, Dad, to you.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.101
What a feeling.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.895
You just joined
the best club in the world.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.606
-How's Nic?
-Uh, doing great.

17:03.690 --> 17:06.901
-The baby as well.
-Fantastic. And you?

17:08.945 --> 17:11.239
I think this may be the greatest day
of my entire life.

17:11.322 --> 17:14.576
Can't wait to meet my granddaughter.

17:16.911 --> 17:19.247
Fracture's in a bad place.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.875
It's compressing the thoracic cord

17:21.958 --> 17:24.586
right there between T8 and T9 vertebrae.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.629
KIT:
Exquisitely sensitive location.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.342
This will be a difficult surgery that,

17:30.425 --> 17:32.052
as an orthopedic surgeon,

17:32.135 --> 17:34.471
I'm not equipped to take on alone.

17:34.554 --> 17:38.308
One small misstep,
and your mother will be paralyzed

17:38.391 --> 17:39.851
from the waist down.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.145
There's even a risk

17:42.228 --> 17:43.688
she might not make it off the table.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.816
I'm fully aware.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.238
You know that Dr. Cain is back,

17:52.322 --> 17:55.617
and operating at a full level again.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.744
Come on, Kit, do you really think

17:57.827 --> 17:59.662
I would allow the man who robbed me

17:59.746 --> 18:01.998
of the love of my life
the opportunity to harm

18:02.082 --> 18:04.668
the mother who means more to me
than life itself?

18:04.751 --> 18:07.379
I know how you feel about Cain.

18:07.462 --> 18:10.590
And I, of all people, understand.

18:10.674 --> 18:13.218
But don't let your hatred of him take away

18:13.301 --> 18:14.594
your mother's best chance.

18:14.678 --> 18:19.140
Dr. Tagg at Atlanta General

18:19.224 --> 18:20.642
is available.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.603
I didn't know you were
having her transferred.

18:24.688 --> 18:26.356
Tagg is a fine surgeon.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.733
He's one of the best.

18:28.817 --> 18:31.903
Cain may have healed,
but he hasn't changed.

18:31.986 --> 18:35.323
Asking him to care about
anybody other than Cain

18:35.407 --> 18:38.576
is like asking a snake
to catch a baseball.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.787
The man cannot be trusted.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.832
You, of all people, should know that, Kit.

18:43.915 --> 18:47.460
No, my mother will be safer
at Atlanta General.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.629
Transfer has already been arranged.

18:58.304 --> 19:02.017
Mm, new jacket.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.810
I like it.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.521
This dinner won't take long.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.064
-Can we meet up afterwards?
-Mm-hmm.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.150
We have a lot to discuss.

19:13.236 --> 19:15.655
Sorry.
Am I interrupting?

19:15.739 --> 19:17.991
No.
We were just headed out.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.826
What can I do for you?

19:19.909 --> 19:21.161
No more surgery for the rest of the day?

19:21.244 --> 19:22.912
No.
I cleared my schedule.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.748
I'm meeting with a recruiter
from Johns Hopkins.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.750
ROSE:
See you later tonight.

19:34.257 --> 19:36.384
You're thinking of leaving Chastain?

19:36.468 --> 19:38.178
I'm grateful for all the care
that they've given me,

19:38.261 --> 19:40.930
but not enough to make peanuts
for the rest of my life.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.892
Hundreds of thousands a year
isn't peanuts.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.185
It's not five million dollars either.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.187
What about Rose?

19:47.270 --> 19:49.439
She... she's part of my decision.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.569
I have to ask you something.

19:54.652 --> 19:57.906
You were a patient at Chastain.
You suffered.

19:57.989 --> 20:01.534
You saw the world from the other
side of the white coat.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.994
Did it change you?

20:03.078 --> 20:05.413
I can say that I will never do something

20:05.497 --> 20:09.125
that benefits me but is wrong
for the patient ever again.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.670
You know I made a terrible
mistake when I was a fifth-year.

20:11.753 --> 20:14.089
I operated unsupervised
and a man's life was ruined.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.549
But I did penance
working all over the globe

20:16.633 --> 20:17.884
with rescue organizations.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.762
You want me to operate
on Dr. Austin's mother

20:20.845 --> 20:22.889
as some sort of act of redemption.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.892
You know the likeliest doctor
to get a successful outcome

20:25.975 --> 20:27.060
on this one is you.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.853
And the chances are long
regardless of who does

20:28.937 --> 20:30.271
such a high-risk surgery.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.440
Which is likely to fail
even in the best of hands.

20:32.524 --> 20:34.693
-Have you offered?
-No.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.778
And no one's asked.

20:39.489 --> 20:42.200
You know, I can recommend you
to Johns Hopkins as well.

20:42.283 --> 20:45.829
It's one of the best hospitals
in the country.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.164
Kit Voss gave me a second chance.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.666
When someone does that,

20:49.749 --> 20:51.793
I believe you owe them everything.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.509
(crying)

20:59.592 --> 21:01.428
I told you-- she likes me more than him.

21:01.511 --> 21:05.223
Just wait till you see
your stock portfolio.

21:05.306 --> 21:07.267
(laughs): Okay, Dad.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.518
I'm kidding.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.562
-No, he's not.
-Mm.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.605
All right, Nic is going
to the garden with Billie

21:12.689 --> 21:14.274
to get some air.
Baby's going

21:14.357 --> 21:16.651
to the nursery for a bit,
so how about you two

21:16.735 --> 21:18.028
continue this fight over lunch--
sound good?

21:18.111 --> 21:19.195
KYLE:
That sounds like a plan.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.238
I got this new restaurant

21:20.321 --> 21:21.698
I've been meaning to try
around the corner.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.908
I'm gonna have surf and turf.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.452
And you're paying for it.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.914
Billie will be here soon.

21:29.998 --> 21:34.044
Dr. Hawkins?
Can I have a word, please?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.672
-Mm.
-(Gigi fussing)

21:39.674 --> 21:41.343
I have a favor to ask of you.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.053
This is my nephew.
He's 16.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.971
He has sickle cell disease

21:45.055 --> 21:47.557
and both his parents lost
their jobs during the pandemic.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.059
They have no health insurance,

21:49.142 --> 21:50.643
and their boy is suffering terribly.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.979
It's killing our family watching his pain.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.773
You want me to try to get him
the same protocol

21:54.856 --> 21:57.067
-that cured Rose?
-Yes.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.402
Okay. Let me look into it,
see what I can do.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.112
Thank you.

22:05.283 --> 22:06.785
Would you like to move
the sickle cell treatment

22:06.868 --> 22:08.870
-out into the community?
-Yes.

22:08.953 --> 22:10.705
Great.
I just heard about

22:10.789 --> 22:12.749
a potential new patient for the protocol.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.834
Can you talk to the CEO
of Bio South about him?

22:14.918 --> 22:17.295
I know you have other,
bigger priorities today...

22:17.379 --> 22:19.130
(both chuckle)

22:19.214 --> 22:21.132
...but you can talk to him
yourself if you want to.

22:21.216 --> 22:22.967
His name is Phillip Bondman.

22:23.051 --> 22:25.011
He'll be arriving
for a board meeting shortly.

22:25.095 --> 22:27.847
Nah, I may not be the best person
to chat up a pharma exec.

22:27.931 --> 22:30.892
No, Conrad, he's one of the good guys.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.186
His company is a scrappy start-up,

22:33.269 --> 22:35.855
formed to bring cures
to underserved populations

22:35.939 --> 22:37.732
at a reasonable price.

22:37.816 --> 22:39.526
I see we're not the only ones
trying to catch

22:39.609 --> 22:41.695
this busy woman on the fly.

22:41.778 --> 22:44.280
Dr. Bell has a patient
who needs a liver transplant.

22:44.364 --> 22:45.699
So do I.

22:45.782 --> 22:48.660
And you've heard Chastain
has an available organ.

22:48.743 --> 22:51.079
The intended recipient just died.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.748
Roland Rawlins, 69,
already nearing our age cutoff.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.583
So if we wait longer,
he's not gonna qualify.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.002
My patient Astrid, she's young,

22:57.085 --> 22:58.586
otherwise healthy,
has her whole life ahead of her.

22:58.670 --> 23:02.215
Well, the transplant coordinator
will figure out who gets it.

23:02.298 --> 23:05.051
Well, we have a better idea.
Astrid's liver is functioning,

23:05.135 --> 23:07.012
but kicking out misfolded proteins.

23:07.095 --> 23:09.597
Ah, I see where you're going.
Any liver, even a damaged one,

23:09.681 --> 23:12.350
-would help Bell's patient.
-Exactly.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.352
It might even add years to his life.

23:14.436 --> 23:17.772
So you're proposing a domino transplant--

23:17.856 --> 23:21.192
Astrid gets the donor liver
and Rawlins gets her liver.

23:21.276 --> 23:23.278
It's brilliant.
A twofer.

23:23.361 --> 23:24.904
We need to run a few more tests
to make sure they're a match,

23:24.988 --> 23:26.614
but if Astrid agrees...

23:26.698 --> 23:29.951
We get to save two lives today
with one donor liver.

23:33.621 --> 23:36.041
AJ, are you sure this transfer
is a good idea?

23:36.124 --> 23:38.376
Yes, Mom.
The ambulance is already waiting for you.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.962
I'm gonna drive over
and meet you at Atlanta General.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.380
Well, when will I have the surgery?

23:42.464 --> 23:43.590
I'm trying to get it on the schedule

23:43.673 --> 23:45.925
for tomorrow at the latest, all right?

23:46.009 --> 23:47.886
So tonight, you just rest.

23:47.969 --> 23:49.095
Hey, if you want to go ahead of her

23:49.179 --> 23:50.388
and meet the ambulance on the other end,

23:50.472 --> 23:51.765
I'll handle this.

23:51.848 --> 23:53.391
Irving, thank you.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.185
All right, Mom, I'll see you there.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.066
IRVING:
AJ, stop.

24:01.149 --> 24:04.402
Uh, will you guys put her
in bay ten for a sec?

24:05.695 --> 24:07.697
-Just gonna...
-W-Why? I don't understand.

24:07.781 --> 24:10.658
What-what... what's wrong?

24:10.742 --> 24:12.660
I don't think she's stable
enough for transfer.

24:12.744 --> 24:15.372
-What are you talking about?
-The sheets are wet. She's incontinent.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.589
Mrs. Austin, can you feel this?

24:24.673 --> 24:25.757
No, I can't.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.092
IRVING:
Okay.

24:27.175 --> 24:29.469
Wiggle your toes for me.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.726
-AUSTIN: Good job, Mom.
-Mm.

24:39.604 --> 24:41.523
Her cord compression
is rapidly progressing.

24:41.606 --> 24:43.149
She's not going to Atlanta General.

24:43.233 --> 24:46.820
We need to decompress
the spine in the OR, now.

24:46.903 --> 24:48.822
There's no time to get Dr. Tagg over here

24:48.905 --> 24:51.366
or get him privileges,
even if he is available.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.034
What do you want to do?

24:56.788 --> 25:00.458
Well, you said yourself:
we got to get her to the OR.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.043
Is there another neurosurgeon

25:02.127 --> 25:04.838
available and on-site right now?

25:21.438 --> 25:23.189
Thanks for getting me out, Billie.

25:23.273 --> 25:25.483
I really needed some air.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.361
I was worried about you after
our conversation last night.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.032
Is your son still texting you?

25:32.115 --> 25:33.658
BILLIE:
No.

25:33.742 --> 25:38.121
No.
And I don't want to think about it.

25:38.204 --> 25:41.166
Even calling him my son freaks me out.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.711
He's someone else's son.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.921
But the child you gave up
when you were 13--

25:47.005 --> 25:49.382
he's-he's out there, he's looking for you.

25:49.466 --> 25:52.761
Well, I wrote back
and I told him I wanted no contact.

25:52.844 --> 25:54.512
I just want him to leave me alone.

25:54.596 --> 25:57.098
I hope seeing us with the baby
today didn't help.

25:57.182 --> 25:58.516
(laughs softly)

26:00.518 --> 26:03.104
But it makes me realize
I'll never have what you have.

26:04.105 --> 26:06.524
Not after what I went through.

26:09.110 --> 26:12.739
The day I held my first child
was nothing like this.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.451
I'm so sorry, Billie.

26:18.411 --> 26:20.622
Don't be.

26:20.705 --> 26:22.832
We have each other.

26:22.916 --> 26:25.460
It makes me happy seeing you so happy.

26:25.543 --> 26:27.128
Billie.

26:27.212 --> 26:29.881
We need you for emergency surgery.

26:29.964 --> 26:32.008
It's AJ's mother.

26:32.092 --> 26:34.260
-She's not being transferred?
-No, and there's no time

26:34.344 --> 26:36.304
for the Atlanta General surgeon
to get here.

26:36.388 --> 26:39.265
Dr. Yang has a subdural abscess in OR Four

26:39.349 --> 26:40.684
that's wrapping up soon.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.310
-She'll step in.
-Okay.

26:42.394 --> 26:44.020
Yeah. Go.
Go, go.

26:49.192 --> 26:51.194
(applause)

26:54.114 --> 26:55.865
-Yeah.
-CONRAD: Mr. Bondman?

26:55.949 --> 26:57.701
CEO of Bio South, right?

26:57.784 --> 26:59.619
Yeah.
Who's asking?

26:59.703 --> 27:02.122
Conrad Hawkins, internal medicine.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.707
Oh, sure, yeah.
Devon's mentioned you.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.583
-Says you're the best doctor at Chastain.
-(laughs)

27:05.667 --> 27:07.043
Well, Kit Voss said I should talk to you

27:07.127 --> 27:09.462
about a new patient for your protocol.

27:09.546 --> 27:11.297
Rose is just one case and I understand

27:11.381 --> 27:13.341
you want to make the cure
widely available.

27:13.425 --> 27:14.718
Yeah, sorry.
Uh, as of this week,

27:14.801 --> 27:16.428
that's-that's no longer my call.

27:16.511 --> 27:17.887
Why is that?

27:17.971 --> 27:21.266
I sold Bio South
to a pharmaceutical conglomerate.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.685
Of course you did.

27:24.811 --> 27:25.979
Kit Voss convinced Chastain

27:26.062 --> 27:27.397
to invest in my company.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.857
That's why they're celebrating.

27:28.940 --> 27:31.192
She just dug Chastain
out of a huge financial hole.

27:31.276 --> 27:32.485
The hospital's gonna make a killing.

27:32.569 --> 27:33.820
As are you.

27:33.903 --> 27:36.239
There's nothing wrong with that.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.741
The new owners have deep pockets.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.367
They'll be able to ramp up
production in a way

27:39.451 --> 27:41.911
-that Bio South never could.
-And jack up prices.

27:41.995 --> 27:43.997
Isn't that the way it always works?

27:44.080 --> 27:46.499
A small start-up comes up
with an innovation,

27:46.583 --> 27:48.335
sells to the medical-industrial complex

27:48.418 --> 27:50.920
and prices go through the roof.

27:52.547 --> 27:55.550
How much is a sickle cell cure
gonna cost now?

27:56.801 --> 28:00.513
One million per patient?
Two?

28:00.597 --> 28:01.890
With all due respect, Dr. Hawkins,

28:01.973 --> 28:03.600
the profit motive-- it's not evil.

28:03.683 --> 28:06.519
Okay? It got us
safe and effective COVID vaccines

28:06.603 --> 28:08.146
and now it's gonna help
a lot of people with sickle cell anemia.

28:08.229 --> 28:09.522
The rich ones.

28:09.606 --> 28:12.442
-How much is it gonna cost?
-Rose is cured.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.402
That's a win, right?

28:14.486 --> 28:17.197
-I'm sorry you're not happy for me.
-(elevator bell chimes)

28:17.280 --> 28:19.741
Personally, I'm very happy for her.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.785
And for Chastain.

28:29.793 --> 28:32.087
-It's gonna be okay, Dad.
-I don't know about that, baby.

28:32.170 --> 28:34.297
It may be the end
of my long and winding road.

28:34.381 --> 28:37.634
No, actually, we're hoping
to give you many more good years.

28:37.717 --> 28:39.844
Hi.
I'm Dr. Randolph Bell.

28:39.928 --> 28:42.722
Um, I'm Roland's daughter Lola.
Pleased to meet you.

28:42.806 --> 28:44.432
-He found me a used car kind of liver.
-(soft laughter)

28:44.516 --> 28:46.476
Gonna put it in me.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.812
It's got some dents,
high miles, but one owner.

28:48.895 --> 28:50.522
-BELL: Yeah, exactly.
-Used cars are the only thing

28:50.605 --> 28:52.482
bluesmen ever drive.
Isn't that right, baby?

28:52.565 --> 28:53.775
I love you, Dad.

28:53.858 --> 28:55.860
All right, love you, too, baby.

28:55.944 --> 28:57.737
I'll make sure
you're posted on our progress.

28:57.821 --> 29:00.240
Thank you so much, Dr. Bell.

29:00.323 --> 29:02.075
I'm just grateful he has this chance.

29:08.998 --> 29:10.458
BILLIE:
Where is Dr. Yang?

29:10.542 --> 29:12.210
KIT:
Still tied up in OR Four.

29:12.293 --> 29:14.504
We'll have to hold the fort
until she gets here.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.172
BILLIE: We need a neurosurgeon.
You're an orthopedic...

29:16.256 --> 29:18.675
KIT: Yes. I can deal
with the bones of the spine,

29:18.758 --> 29:20.510
I can help get exposure.

29:20.593 --> 29:24.389
But we'll leave the corpectomy
until Dr. Yang can make it.

29:24.472 --> 29:27.851
I'll need regular updates
on Yang's status.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.144
JESSICA:
You got it.

29:35.483 --> 29:37.485
BELL: Dr. Devi, get ready
to clamp the portal vein.

29:37.569 --> 29:40.030
I've got the IVC.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.281
LEELA:
Got it.

29:47.287 --> 29:49.622
BELL:
Clamping the hepatic artery.

29:49.706 --> 29:52.751
LEELA:
Suprahepatic vena cava clamped.

29:52.834 --> 29:55.503
-Now?
-BELL: Now.

29:55.587 --> 29:57.589
Time to mobilize the liver.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.177
Thank you.

30:05.930 --> 30:08.558
Okay, we're heading off to the other OR.

30:24.866 --> 30:27.660
LEELA: I can't believe
we took out Astrid's liver...

30:27.744 --> 30:30.080
and now we're sewing it
into Roland's body.

30:30.163 --> 30:34.209
BELL: This is why surgeons
can mistake themselves for gods.

30:34.292 --> 30:37.754
'Cause every now and then...
we work miracles.

30:45.345 --> 30:46.680
Dad, I tried to take what happened to you

30:46.763 --> 30:48.765
and turn it into something beautiful.

30:50.558 --> 30:53.144
I wanted to make you proud.

31:09.786 --> 31:12.539
Where's Dr. Yang?
What's going on?

31:12.622 --> 31:14.749
-(phone ringing)
-KIT: Talk to us.

31:14.833 --> 31:17.877
JESSICA:
Dr. Yang can't leave her OR.

31:17.961 --> 31:19.337
She's dealing with massive cerebral edema

31:19.421 --> 31:21.881
in her subdural abscess patient.

31:31.558 --> 31:33.560
(line ringing)

31:34.894 --> 31:36.688
-So, lay it out for me.
-(phone vibrating)

31:36.771 --> 31:38.356
Why should I move to Johns Hopkins?

31:38.440 --> 31:39.774
A host of reasons.

31:39.858 --> 31:41.359
But top of the list, we can offer you

31:41.443 --> 31:44.279
unprecedented surgical volume
and world-class facilities.

31:46.031 --> 31:47.198
Do you need to take that?

31:49.743 --> 31:52.537
No.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.622
<i>This is Barrett Cain.</i>
<i>Please leave a message at the beep.</i>

31:54.706 --> 31:58.251
KIT: We need a neurosurgeon.
I can't do anymore.

31:58.335 --> 32:00.587
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Kit.

32:00.670 --> 32:02.964
-Kit, what's happening?
-KIT: Billie has to take over.

32:03.048 --> 32:04.966
I've reached the end of what
my license allows me to do

32:05.050 --> 32:06.634
and we can't wait any longer for Dr. Yang.

32:06.718 --> 32:08.345
She is not even an attending.

32:08.428 --> 32:12.140
Come on, Kit,
this is a train wreck waiting to happen.

32:12.223 --> 32:14.142
It's too complex for a resident!

32:14.225 --> 32:16.144
BILLIE:
He's right. I can't.

32:16.227 --> 32:17.437
Yes you can.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.773
The longer we wait,
the less chance we have

32:19.856 --> 32:21.483
that the spinal cord will recover.

32:21.566 --> 32:24.110
You have to do this, Billie.
