(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

00:25.560 --> 00:27.080
Hello. Can we help you?

00:27.160 --> 00:29.360
My name is Tyler McCarthy.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.280
I have some
very important information...

00:32.160 --> 00:33.440
About a murder.

00:34.120 --> 00:35.160
OK.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.920
The murder of Julie Matlock.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.320
Julie Matlock,
editor of
The Saint Marie Times?

00:40.400 --> 00:41.440
That was...

00:41.520 --> 00:43.480
I know. Eight years ago.

00:43.560 --> 00:47.640
Julie Matlock was murdered
and Nadine Hunter
was convicted for it.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.960
But the thing is,

00:50.040 --> 00:53.480
Nadine didn't do it.
She couldn't have.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.840
She was with me that night,
I swear to you.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.520
(SIGHS) You've got
the wrong person.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.440

Dad!

02:00.040 --> 02:01.280
Dad!

02:02.680 --> 02:03.720
Did you call me?

02:03.800 --> 02:05.280
What are you doing?

02:05.360 --> 02:07.440
Oh, I was just looking
for a hammer and some nails,

02:07.520 --> 02:09.840
and I discovered this place.
Isn't it fantastic?

02:09.920 --> 02:11.600
(GLASS BREAKING)

02:11.680 --> 02:14.800
Yeah, fantastic. What are you
gonna do with all this stuff?

02:14.880 --> 02:16.680
Well, I'm throwing it out.

02:16.760 --> 02:18.480
There won't be room for it,
if I'm going to
get a bed in here.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.200
A bed?

02:20.280 --> 02:22.040
My back's not
made for a hammock.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.160
(SIGHS)

02:23.240 --> 02:25.120
Ah, Florence. How are you?

02:25.200 --> 02:26.720
To what do we
owe this pleasure?

02:26.800 --> 02:28.280
I'm good, sir. Thank you.

02:28.360 --> 02:31.080
I hope I'm not
interrupting your holiday.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.560
No, not in the slightest.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.560
The Commissioner asked me
to come and see you.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.480
We were hoping
we could maybe borrow you?

02:38.560 --> 02:39.880
Borrow me?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.880
He was wondering
if you can help on a new case.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.560
Well,
it's more of an old case,

02:44.640 --> 02:46.360
but I'll explain on the way.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.920
Hmm. OK.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.040
Well, always happy to oblige.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.480
I suppose I better
smarten myself up.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.000
You might need
to iron a shirt.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.360
Mmm-hmm. Good point.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.360
TYLER:
Eight years ago, I was on

03:00.440 --> 03:02.800
vacation here
with my girlfriend.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.960
It was our last night,
we had a big argument.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.080
Ended with both
of us storming off.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.560
The Festival was on.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.320
I just fell into
the nearest bar there was.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.720
That's where I met Nadine.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.360
Happy Saint Ursula's Day.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.160
Neither of us were
in a great place,
both drunk.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.920
One thing led to another.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.240
You spent the night together.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.920
Yeah.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.760
When I woke up
the next morning,
she had left.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.680
I never saw her again.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.720
And at the time
you weren't aware
of the coverage of the murder?

03:29.800 --> 03:32.240
You hadn't read the papers
or seen the news?

03:32.320 --> 03:35.520
I had no idea
Nadine was
arrested for murder.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.680
And how did you find out now?

03:38.080 --> 03:40.080
My marriage recently ended.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.760
Sorry.

03:41.840 --> 03:42.960
Same girl from this...

03:43.040 --> 03:44.120
Yes.

03:44.200 --> 03:47.480
I know.
Writing was on the wall.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.360
(SIGHS) These last few months,

03:49.440 --> 03:52.640
I keep thinking about
that night here on the island.

03:52.720 --> 03:53.920
About Nadine.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.440
I knew it was
Festival time again,

03:55.520 --> 03:58.240
so I came down here
to see if I could find her.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.840
And that's when you found out
what had happened?

04:01.600 --> 04:02.920
(INHALES DEEPLY)

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
She died in prison.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.720
Pneumonia,
three years into her sentence.

04:10.040 --> 04:13.320
She didn't deserve that.
Any of it.

04:13.400 --> 04:14.760
She was innocent.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.360
So, what do you think, sir?

04:24.440 --> 04:27.320
It sounds plausible.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.000
No reason to make it up,
as far as I can tell.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.640
Nothing to gain from it.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.560
I checked earlier
with Immigration,

04:33.640 --> 04:36.400
and he was on the island
eight years ago, like he says.

04:36.480 --> 04:39.120
He also fits the description
Nadine Hunter gave

04:39.200 --> 04:41.040
of the man she claimed
that she spent the night with.

04:42.280 --> 04:43.760
So what do we do now?

04:43.840 --> 04:46.520
I don't think
there's a choice, Florence.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.600
You, or should I say we,
reopen the case.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.640
JACK:
So this is Nadine Hunter.

04:55.720 --> 04:59.400
And this is Julie Matlock,
the woman she was
accused of killing.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.000
DWAYNE:
We never found her body.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.320
You remember the case, Dwayne?

05:02.400 --> 05:03.600
Oh, yes.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.200
It was when DI
Charlie Hulme was here.

05:06.280 --> 05:08.560
Julie Matlock was editor
of The Saint Marie Times,

05:08.640 --> 05:11.080
and quite a respected figure
on the island.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.520
And what was her relationship
to Nadine Hunter?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.560
Nadine worked under
Julie at the paper.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.120
She was a photographer.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.200
But there were
definite tensions
between them.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.880
Oh. In what way?

05:20.960 --> 05:24.680
Well, you see,
Miss Hunter was
a little bit unstable,

05:24.760 --> 05:27.160
dependent on alcohol
and anti-depressants.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.720
Hmm. Not a great mix
at the best of times.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.440
Mmm. Well,
the night before the murder,

05:31.520 --> 05:33.040
they had a very
public falling-out.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.840
Julie had suspended
Nadine from her job

05:34.920 --> 05:37.360
until she agreed to accept
professional help.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.200
And that's why
she was suspected
of killing Julie Matlock?

05:40.280 --> 05:42.800
Mmm-hmm. Plus...

05:42.880 --> 05:44.680
Miss Hunter was
a registered gun owner.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.200
When we searched her flat,
there was no
sign of the weapon,

05:47.280 --> 05:49.520
and her car was missing, too.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.360
We fished that out of the bay
the following day.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.200
We found the gun in the boot,
along with this,

05:57.280 --> 06:00.480
Julie Matlock's
bloodied scarf.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.840
Now,
the court didn't have a body,

06:01.920 --> 06:03.760
but they had means, motive,

06:03.840 --> 06:06.600
and because she couldn't
prove her alibi, opportunity.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.160
What's this?

06:09.240 --> 06:11.520
That's one of the reasons
I can still remember the case.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.440
It's creepy.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.360
We actually had
the murder on tape.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.960
Really?

06:17.040 --> 06:18.640
On the night it happened,

06:18.720 --> 06:20.680
Julie Matlock was working late
at the newspaper offices.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.160
At 8:15 p.m.,
she phoned her
daughter from her mobile

06:23.240 --> 06:25.280
and started leaving
an answer-phone message.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.600
That's when she got shot.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.440
JULIE: Hi, Gracie.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.240
Look, I know I said
we should do dinner,

06:31.320 --> 06:32.920
but guess what?
I'm still at the office.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.120
I'm probably gonna
be here another...

06:34.200 --> 06:35.240
(GUNSHOT)

06:35.320 --> 06:36.360
Good Lord!

06:37.400 --> 06:39.080
(EXHALES)

06:39.160 --> 06:40.960
The newspaper
office where it happened,

06:41.040 --> 06:42.360
is it still there?

06:42.440 --> 06:43.560
Oh, yes.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.680
(SIGHS)

06:56.360 --> 06:57.680
So.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.120
All the staff are
waiting downstairs,

06:59.200 --> 07:00.480
if you need to
talk to any of them.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.080
Great. Talk me through it.

07:03.160 --> 07:06.760
What exactly happened here
on the night of
June 22nd, 2009?

07:06.840 --> 07:08.520
On
the afternoon of the murder,

07:08.600 --> 07:11.760
Julie Matlock's
colleagues left
at around 4:30.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.160
We've had a hell of a day.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.840
You all go,
I'll stay here and finish up.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.040
JACK: So,
there was no-one else here,
apart from Julie?

07:20.120 --> 07:23.560
Until whoever did it
turned up at some
point and shot her

07:23.640 --> 07:25.240
at 8:15 p.m.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.000
Hmm.

07:28.720 --> 07:31.640
So, where was she
when it happened?

07:31.720 --> 07:33.920
According to the files,

07:34.000 --> 07:35.680
Forensics found
significant traces of bleach

07:35.760 --> 07:38.200
on and around
her desk and chair,

07:38.280 --> 07:40.680
suggesting it was cleaned
after the murder.

07:40.760 --> 07:44.480
Yes, and, um,
Julie's desk is
that one over there.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.560
She was sitting here,
working away,

07:49.640 --> 07:52.040
doing whatever editors do,

07:52.120 --> 07:53.720
when she decided to
phone her daughter
and say

07:53.800 --> 07:54.960
she wasn't going to
make it to dinner.

07:55.040 --> 07:56.080
Yeah.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.640
Hmm.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.640
Any evidence to suggest
where the gun was fired from?

08:00.720 --> 08:03.920
Not that I can find.
No traces of gunshot residue.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.720
And without the body, it's...

08:05.800 --> 08:07.560
We don't know where
the fatal bullet entered.

08:07.640 --> 08:08.800
JACK: (SIGHS) Yeah.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.000
Could you just
excuse me one moment?

08:48.960 --> 08:50.000
What's he doing?

08:50.080 --> 08:51.040
(INHALES SHARPLY)

08:55.440 --> 08:57.280
Well, that's interesting.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.480
You think you know
where the gun was fired from?

08:59.560 --> 09:01.840
Oh,
I haven't a clue, Florence.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.760
I'd say it's about
100% impossible to tell.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.600
JP, those crime scene reports,

09:07.680 --> 09:09.080
any mention of how the killer

09:09.160 --> 09:11.200
moved the victim
after she had been shot?

09:11.280 --> 09:12.800
Yes, sir.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.440
There was a fire
door downstairs
found open on the night.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.440
It leads on to the car park.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.960
It was assumed
that the killer used

09:19.040 --> 09:20.760
the lift to get
the body down there.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.960
So whoever did it was familiar
with the layout
of the building.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.640
And they'd have
needed a key to get in.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.040
Security had
locked up for the night,

09:27.120 --> 09:29.080
leaving Mrs Matlock
alone in the building.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.240
Yes, sir. The initial
investigation concluded

09:31.320 --> 09:33.480
that it must have been
one of
the other employees here

09:33.560 --> 09:34.920
at the newspaper.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.480
So, who else had
a key to the building?

09:36.560 --> 09:38.000
Well, apart from the security,

09:38.080 --> 09:40.560
only the other members
of the senior editorial team.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.320
And who exactly were they?

09:42.400 --> 09:45.560
Julie's husband, Ian Matlock,

09:45.640 --> 09:48.080
her daughter, Grace,

09:48.160 --> 09:54.040
and journalists
Tony Garret and Kai Johnson.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.960
It's the same team
still working here.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.760
There's just one thing.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.720
Part of the reason
the original investigation

10:00.800 --> 10:02.360
focussed in on Nadine Hunter

10:02.440 --> 10:04.040
was because she
was the only one
who couldn't prove

10:04.120 --> 10:05.520
where she was
on the night of the murder,

10:05.600 --> 10:09.280
whereas these four
all had rock-solid alibis.

10:09.360 --> 10:12.080
Of course they did.
It's typical.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.360
JACK: Look, I know
this is very
upsetting for you all.

10:17.440 --> 10:19.800
It's just...
Well, this witness
has come forward,

10:19.880 --> 10:22.200
and we're duty bound
to look into things.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.560
So, if we could just
have a little chat,

10:24.640 --> 10:27.720
I'm sure we can
clear everything up
once and for all.

10:27.800 --> 10:31.080
Right. Day of the murder,
according to
the original statements,

10:31.160 --> 10:33.200
you all left
here at 4:30 p.m.,

10:33.280 --> 10:35.240
leaving Julie to
finish up on her own.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.880
She more or less threw us out
after Nadine Hunter turned up.

10:39.360 --> 10:40.560
Nadine?

10:40.640 --> 10:43.200
I'm here for my stuff.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.800
We can send your things on.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.360
Don't touch me!

10:46.440 --> 10:47.880
We're not finished!

10:49.320 --> 10:51.600
She's totally lost it.

10:51.680 --> 10:55.160
The evening before,
you were dining at the...

10:55.240 --> 10:58.320
At the Blue Orchid.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.360
She showed up,
she was out of her head.

11:00.440 --> 11:03.960
I know what you're doing.
You'll pay for this!

11:04.040 --> 11:05.480
(SOBBING) Let me go.

11:06.480 --> 11:07.800
(SOBBING)

11:10.320 --> 11:12.200
And she was so angry

11:12.280 --> 11:14.520
because Julie
had suspended her
from her job. Is that correct?

11:14.600 --> 11:16.120
No! It's because
she had a screw loose.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.160
Gracie...

11:19.160 --> 11:22.000
She was a damaged soul.

11:22.080 --> 11:25.520
Dad, how can you
still stick up for her?

11:25.600 --> 11:28.960
Does anyone have any idea
why she was so down
in the dumps, or...

11:29.040 --> 11:31.160
You know,
so fond of the old drink?

11:31.240 --> 11:32.840
Wasn't there
something about a guy who

11:32.920 --> 11:34.440
broke her heart
years ago or something,

11:34.520 --> 11:35.600
at college?

11:35.680 --> 11:37.120
Who cares?

11:37.200 --> 11:39.040
Mum was a good friend to her.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.840
She was an ungrateful bitch!

11:41.920 --> 11:44.960
I think Nadine thought
Julie wanted to
get rid of her,

11:45.040 --> 11:46.440
whereas, the fact is...

11:46.520 --> 11:48.440
She just wanted her to get
professional help, huh?

11:48.520 --> 11:51.240
That's why she suspended her?

11:51.320 --> 11:54.960
Let's be honest,
none of us could
work with her any more.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.640
So, next evening,
night of the murder.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.480
Miss Matlock,
your mother phoned
and left that message.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.400
I take it you were
out that evening.

12:05.480 --> 12:08.280
No, I was there,
but I was in the shower.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.680
I was at the house, too.

12:09.760 --> 12:12.640
Heard the phone ring,
let it go to voicemail.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.040
Grace played it
when she came
out of the shower.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.480
JULIE: Hi, Gracie.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.040
Look, I know I said
we should do dinner,

12:18.120 --> 12:20.000
but guess what?
I'm still at the office.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.800
-I'm probably gonna
be here another...
-(GUNSHOT)

12:21.880 --> 12:23.800
GRACE:
I phoned Dad straight away.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.280
Dad. Dad!

12:26.360 --> 12:29.200
IAN:
I was up at our beach house.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.760
I phoned you lot straightaway
and got into the car.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.960
And this beach house,
is it nearby?

12:35.040 --> 12:36.800
About 40 minutes by car.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.640
Oh.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.920
OK. Well, that's very clear.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.360
So, night of the murder,

12:42.440 --> 12:44.320
Grace and Kai,
you were together at home,

12:44.400 --> 12:45.760
and Ian,
you were at the beach house.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.040
Yes.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.040
Mr Garret... Tony,

12:50.120 --> 12:53.080
where were you that evening
at about 8:15 p.m.?

12:53.160 --> 12:56.600
It was Festival night.
I was in Denny's Bar,

12:56.680 --> 12:58.160
along with half of Honore.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.720
GRACE: Read the statements.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.880
That woman came
into the office
and threatened Mum.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.480
"We are not finished,"
that's what she said,

13:04.560 --> 13:06.640
straight to her face.
You remember?

13:09.280 --> 13:10.880
Whoever this man is
and whatever he says,

13:10.960 --> 13:12.960
Nadine Hunter
killed my mother.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.520
OK. Well, thank you, all.

13:18.640 --> 13:22.440
JACK: Ah, JP, could you get
your hands on
some hi-fi equipment?

13:22.520 --> 13:26.280
The best you can find.
External speakers,
the whole works.

13:26.360 --> 13:29.520
Let's see if there's any more
background noises on
that voice message.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.560
You know,
the killer entering the room,
footsteps, that sort of thing.

13:32.640 --> 13:36.640
Yep. OK. Um, my cousin's a DJ.
I'm sure he'll have something.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.880
Brilliant. Thanks.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.680
JP: Commissioner.
DWAYNE: Commissioner.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.480
Inspector, you answered
the call to arms, I see.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.480
Ah, yes, sir.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.320
If for no other
reason than to get out
from under my daughter's feet.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.280
Well, whatever the reason,
I'm glad you're here.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.320
This is rather
a delicate matter.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.280
Yes, I suppose it is a bit.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.840
Do you think
there is any substance
to what this man says?

14:00.920 --> 14:04.520
Well,
I think we should proceed
as though there is.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.800
Until we manage
to talk ourselves out of it.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.400
You seem worried,
Commissioner,

14:14.480 --> 14:16.480
but I reckon I would be, too,
if I was in your shoes.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.200
I'm sorry?

14:18.280 --> 14:22.640
Um... Well, no. Just...
If the verdict
proved to be unsafe,

14:22.720 --> 14:24.680
well,
wouldn't reflect brilliantly

14:24.760 --> 14:26.600
on your
department now, would it?

14:29.360 --> 14:31.080
(SELWYN SIGHS)

14:31.160 --> 14:33.520
But I've had a brief look
through the case files,

14:33.600 --> 14:35.880
and from what I've seen,
Charlie Hulme was
a good detective.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.240
Very thorough.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.080
So, if a mistake was made,

14:39.160 --> 14:41.120
I'm sure it wasn't
due to negligence
or a lack of effort.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.840
Keep me in the loop,
Inspector.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.480
Absolutely.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.360
Pep talk?

15:03.440 --> 15:05.840
Something like that.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.920
JULIE: But guess what?
I'm still at the office.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.680
-I'm probably gonna
be here another...
-(GUNSHOT)

15:11.400 --> 15:14.120
Something there, isn't there,
in the background?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.160
JULIE: But guess what?
I'm still at the office.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.080
-I'm probably gonna
be here another...
-(GUNSHOT)

15:21.840 --> 15:25.520
Yes, it's like, erm...
A rumble.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.240
JP, do you think
you could isolate that sound?

15:28.320 --> 15:30.520
Oh.
Erm, I could call my cousin,
he might be able to.

15:30.600 --> 15:31.880
-DWAYNE: Hmm.
-Excellent.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.560
You got
something there, Dwayne?

15:33.640 --> 15:36.160
Well,
Nadine Hunter didn't have
any next of kin,

15:36.240 --> 15:37.960
so the prison
authorities sent over

15:38.040 --> 15:39.560
all her possessions
to us when she died.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.880
Clothes.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.160
A Leonard Cohen CD.

15:44.240 --> 15:45.920
(CHUCKLES)

15:47.120 --> 15:48.360
A copy of Wuthering Heights.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.880
What's this?

15:53.960 --> 15:55.960
-A lock of hair?
-Mmm-hmm.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.040
Did she have children?

15:57.120 --> 15:58.760
No.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.800
Maybe it belongs
to her college sweetheart.

16:00.880 --> 16:04.080
It's a bit weird, isn't it?
Keeping a lock of
your boyfriend's hair.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.560
Mmm, I suppose.
Although, an auntie of mine,

16:06.640 --> 16:08.840
she had her heart broken
by the local chiropodist.

16:08.920 --> 16:11.280
To this day, she's holding on
to a pair of his
socks he left behind,

16:11.360 --> 16:13.200
like there's a chance
he'll come back for them.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.760
Maybe Nadine was just
a hopeless romantic.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.480
Maybe.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.320
OK. Why don't we go over
what we know so far

16:27.400 --> 16:30.840
about the victim
and our suspects?

16:30.920 --> 16:32.800
Julie Matlock, 47,

16:32.880 --> 16:35.600
met husband Ian
at Manchester University,

16:35.680 --> 16:38.040
where they edited
the student paper.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.920
They settled in Saint Marie
18 years ago.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.560
They seemed a happy couple.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.840
They were close to finishing
a beach house on the coast

16:43.920 --> 16:45.920
when Mrs Matlock was murdered.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
They were building
the house themselves.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.400
Kai Johnson, 35.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.600
Oh, we looked at
him very closely.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.760
He had a record as
long as your arm.

16:55.840 --> 17:00.760
Assault,
demanding money with menaces,
drug dealing.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.280
They put him in a youth
rehabilitation programme

17:02.360 --> 17:04.680
and got him an apprenticeship
at the newspaper.

17:04.760 --> 17:08.720
It looks like he
turned his life around,
and bagged the boss' daughter.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.880
FLORENCE: Grace Matlock, 30,

17:10.960 --> 17:12.120
their only child.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.920
Not the high
achiever her mum was.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.240
Struggled at school,
didn't go to university.

17:16.320 --> 17:19.960
Only ever worked
for her parents
as a copy editor.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.480
So, husband,
daughter and her boyfriend.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.280
This guy, Tony Garret.

17:24.360 --> 17:26.080
Oh, he's been at
the paper for years,

17:26.160 --> 17:28.720
way before the Matlocks
even took it over.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.840
Right.
And what sort of a man is he?

17:30.920 --> 17:34.240
Likes a party,
but a decent enough guy.

17:34.320 --> 17:38.000
And then there's the original
prime suspect, Nadine Hunter,

17:38.080 --> 17:40.720
who now,
out of the blue, has an alibi
for the night of the murder.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.760
(SIGHS)

17:44.840 --> 17:47.680
Well, look,
I don't think we're going
to achieve much more tonight.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.640
Why don't we call it a day?

17:49.720 --> 17:50.880
Gets my vote.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:52.640 --> 17:54.080
You are aware
of the visiting
inspector rule, right?

17:54.160 --> 17:55.640
Uh, not sure that
I am, Dwayne. No.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.320
It's an old Saint
Marie tradition.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.680
You see,
when an inspector visits
from another region,

18:00.760 --> 18:03.880
he takes us all
to the nearest bar
and buys us a drink.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.840
That wouldn't be a rule
you just made up
yourself now, would it?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.440
-No.
-(CHUCKLES)

18:12.560 --> 18:14.920
I might have made it
up a little, but...

18:15.000 --> 18:18.560
Catherine's bar at
the end of a hard day
is a bit of a tradition.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.560
Well,
a very civilised tradition,
if I may say so.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.880
And here's the lady herself.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.480
Catherine,
meet Inspector Jack Mooney
from the UK.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.840
Lovely to meet you.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.080
Jack.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.360
Welcome to Saint Marie.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.040
Are you visiting the island?

18:35.120 --> 18:36.680
Well, I thought I was.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.720
(CHUCKLES)
He's helping us out.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.480
Oh, and, uh, Catherine is set
to become our next mayor.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.640
Well,
there's the little matter
of the election first.

18:45.720 --> 18:46.880
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

18:46.960 --> 18:48.040
I'll get your drinks.

18:49.760 --> 18:52.000
So, this Festival I
keep hearing about.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.360
Mmm. Saint Ursula's Day.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.440
Which Saint Ursula is it?

18:56.520 --> 18:57.840
There's at least
two that I know of.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.520
There's the one
who was martyred by the Huns.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.760
Poor girl,
she got in the neck,
literally.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.360
And then there's
Saint Ursula Micaela Morata.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.080
She actually had the gift
of bi-location.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.560
Bi-location?

19:07.640 --> 19:09.440
Yeah, the ability
to be in two places at once.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.720
-So, which one is it?
-The one where you
drink a lot of rum

19:10.800 --> 19:12.160
and party
wildly in the street.

19:12.240 --> 19:14.280
Ah! I like her the best.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.200
Thought I'd find you
in the nearest bar.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.360
Ah, Siobhan. Come and join us.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.800
Catherine,
this is my daughter, Siobhan.

19:20.880 --> 19:24.240
Welcome.
Shall I get another beer?

19:24.320 --> 19:26.280
Mmm...
One won't hurt, I suppose.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.640
Oh, the slippery slope.

19:28.720 --> 19:30.360
This is how it all starts.

19:30.440 --> 19:31.440
One. One only.

19:31.520 --> 19:32.720
Ugh.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.440
Cheers, sir.

19:34.520 --> 19:35.920
Oh. Thank you.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.920
JACK: You know what we need?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.640
SIOBHAN: More willpower?

19:44.720 --> 19:46.720
JACK: A grown-up.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.720
Wouldn't hurt.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.080
Remember,
when you were little,

19:54.160 --> 19:56.320
you were so
fascinated by the stars,

19:56.400 --> 19:58.960
you wouldn't let me close
your bedroom curtains.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.040
I remember.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.840
Well, on cloudy nights,
I used to tell you
there were no stars

20:06.920 --> 20:08.720
because
the batteries had run out.

20:10.880 --> 20:13.040
Backfired a bit on me there.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.920
You took the battery
out of every toy you owned

20:15.000 --> 20:16.360
and had them ready
for me at bedtime,

20:17.960 --> 20:20.120
to turn the stars back on.

20:20.200 --> 20:24.400
And you said that they were
the wrong size batteries.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.640
So I did. Sorry about that.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.920
(CHUCKLES) It's OK.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.480
Mum got me
the glow in the dark ones
to stick on the window.

20:34.560 --> 20:39.560
Yeah, just like your mum,
tidying up after my mess.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.560
I really miss her.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.880
I know you do, love.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.560
Me, too.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.560
(RATTLING)

21:27.520 --> 21:29.400
JACK: Thanks a million.
You're a star.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.000
Good man.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.440
What's going on?

21:33.520 --> 21:34.760
I bought a bed.

21:34.840 --> 21:37.280
Have a look.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.640
SIOBHAN: When did you
organise that?

21:38.720 --> 21:40.160
Last night, at the bar.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.120
I mentioned it to Dwayne,
he said he knew a man

21:42.200 --> 21:43.680
who knew a man
whose auntie might be

21:43.760 --> 21:45.600
able to help,
and what do you know?

21:45.680 --> 21:47.880
Now all I need is a pillow
and some sheets,
and I'm right as rain.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.840
Ah, mattress.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.680
JACK: Oh, yeah, a mattress.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.440
(CHUCKLES) I
might have to have
another word with Dwayne.

21:58.160 --> 22:01.120
OK,
so she left the offices there

22:01.200 --> 22:02.800
and went to Port Royal.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.520
OK, why did she go...
Why did she go to Port Royal?

22:05.600 --> 22:08.320
Mmm... Oh.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.000
(JACK MUTTERING)

22:10.080 --> 22:11.520
Who's he talking to?

22:11.600 --> 22:13.320
(SIGHS)

22:13.400 --> 22:15.680
JACK: Why did she...
Why did she do that?

22:15.760 --> 22:19.000
And then, she stayed.
They all went.

22:20.480 --> 22:21.480
Sir?

22:21.560 --> 22:22.560
Mmm-hmm?

22:22.640 --> 22:23.720
Are you OK?

22:23.800 --> 22:25.440
Me? Great.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.400
Couldn't be better.

22:27.480 --> 22:30.280
What about yourself, Florence?
Getting anywhere
with Julie's diary?

22:30.360 --> 22:32.360
Only this.
She scribbled something

22:32.440 --> 22:34.600
on the page
before her last day.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.080
It's a five-digit number.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.320
(JACK READING)

22:38.400 --> 22:40.520
It's hardly a phone number,
not enough digits.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.720
FLORENCE: It's not
a PIN number, either.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.720
I'll see if I can
find something else
it could relate to.

22:44.800 --> 22:45.880
OK.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.240
-JP: Sir?
-Yes, JP?

22:47.320 --> 22:49.280
There's something
here in Julie's inbox.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.240
It's a resignation e-mail
from Tony Garret

22:51.320 --> 22:53.560
sent two days
before Julie was killed.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.080
It reads, erm...

22:55.160 --> 22:57.440
"Dear Julie, while I still
stand by the articles,

22:57.520 --> 22:59.320
"I regret that,
in certain respects,

22:59.400 --> 23:02.800
"my behaviour may
have fallen short
of your expectations.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.520
"I therefore have no option
but to tender my resignation.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.280
"Yours, Tony Garret."

23:07.360 --> 23:09.760
The classic
non-apology apology.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.160
I wonder what
that's all about.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.040
Hmm. I'll keep going back.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.240
Let me see if I can find out
what these
articles were about.

23:15.320 --> 23:19.040
Might be worth paying a visit
to the paper.
Check the archives.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.440
Dwayne, how are you getting on
with financial checks?

23:21.520 --> 23:23.040
Well,
the original investigation

23:23.120 --> 23:24.640
only focused on
the victim's finances,

23:24.720 --> 23:26.400
oh, and Nadine Hunter's,

23:26.480 --> 23:28.840
so I started to look into
the other four suspects.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.360
-And?
-And Ian Matlock's

23:30.440 --> 23:33.160
credit card statements
make for interesting reading.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.720
In the two months
before Julie's death,

23:34.800 --> 23:37.360
there's two,
no, three payments

23:37.440 --> 23:39.920
to somewhere
called Cupid's Arrow.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.320
Cupid's Arrow?

23:42.400 --> 23:43.520
Yes, that's
a high-end lingerie shop

23:43.600 --> 23:44.640
on the other
side of the island.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.080
So I hear.

23:50.160 --> 23:53.440
Then we have
afternoon champagne
at the Bay Cove Hotel

23:53.520 --> 23:56.480
and a payment to the florist's
every day for a month.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.800
Spoiling his wife, eh?

23:57.880 --> 23:59.200
What?

23:59.280 --> 24:01.080
Those kind of
places aren't usually

24:01.160 --> 24:03.320
where men go to
shop for their wives.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.400
Present company excepted.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.480
And what about
the afternoon champagne?

24:08.560 --> 24:10.720
Julie Matlock
was a workaholic.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.560
(SCOFFS)
If you ask me,
it wasn't his wife.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.680
Wasn't there
an insurance payout?

24:15.760 --> 24:17.440
Half a million.

24:17.520 --> 24:21.000
And the husband
was the beneficiary.

24:21.080 --> 24:24.880
Florence, looks like
you and I need to pay
Ian Matlock a visit.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.800
FLORENCE:
Sorry about the weather, sir.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.400
JACK: Reminds me of home.

24:33.480 --> 24:36.280
Ooh! This is some house
they've built for themselves.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.760
So, you need clarification
on something?

24:39.840 --> 24:43.240
Yes, Ian,
that's exactly what we need,
a bit of clarification.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.000
Now, what was it
needed clarifying?

24:49.680 --> 24:51.680
Ah, yes, here it is.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.160
Can you tell us
what you were doing
at the Bay Cove Hotel

24:54.240 --> 24:57.960
on May 18th
and again on
the 3rd of June, 2009?

24:58.040 --> 24:59.640
Shortly before your
wife was murdered.

25:02.280 --> 25:05.480
There's lots of other dates,
but we'll start
with those two for now.

25:07.160 --> 25:08.880
Er...

25:10.080 --> 25:11.600
The Bay Cove Hotel?

25:11.680 --> 25:13.680
Yeah.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.560
Would you like
the dates again?

25:18.120 --> 25:20.120
I suspect you know damn well
what I was doing.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.160
Well...

25:23.240 --> 25:26.560
I have no way of knowing
what you were doing,
Mr Matlock.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.360
Locking yourself
away in a hotel room

25:28.440 --> 25:31.720
with champagne and sexy
lingerie all afternoon,

25:31.800 --> 25:34.640
ah, it could mean
lots of different things.

25:34.720 --> 25:38.120
I'm sorry. It's not exactly
a chapter of my
life I am proud of.

25:38.200 --> 25:39.480
You were having an affair?

25:41.160 --> 25:43.400
Even the most
perfect of marriages
get into a rut.

25:43.480 --> 25:44.920
Although, if I'm honest,

25:45.000 --> 25:46.520
it wasn't my
marriage in a rut,
it was me.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.080
A mid-life crisis.

25:48.160 --> 25:49.520
Hmm.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.640
Can I ask,
who was it you were seeing?

25:51.720 --> 25:53.200
She was a travel rep,

25:53.280 --> 25:55.240
only on the island
for a few weeks at a time,

25:55.320 --> 25:57.960
and Julie was
away on work a lot,
and...

25:59.960 --> 26:04.080
I was vain and stupid,
and I wanted to
feel like the big man.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.680
And did your
wife ever find out?

26:05.760 --> 26:07.160
No! God, she'd have killed me.

26:13.320 --> 26:14.920
It was a few
months that summer.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.920
I came to my
senses and ended it.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.800
It had nothing to do
with my wife's death, I swear.

26:28.560 --> 26:33.040
(CHUCKLES) You know,
I was still at
college in 2009.

26:34.400 --> 26:37.400
Me, I was getting
my heart broken.

26:37.480 --> 26:39.600
You,
getting your heart broken?

26:39.680 --> 26:42.280
You better believe it.
Big time.

26:43.160 --> 26:45.080
Monica Canon.

26:45.160 --> 26:49.080
Gorgeous girl. Kind,
sweet, looked like a model.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.760
So, what happened?

26:51.840 --> 26:53.320
I broke it off.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.400
Why?

26:56.120 --> 26:59.160
Well, it was nothing.
I can't even remember.

26:59.240 --> 27:00.800
(SUCKS TEETH)

27:02.160 --> 27:04.040
OK, there was
a slight height issue.

27:05.480 --> 27:08.640
She was taller than me.
A lot taller.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.560
You dumped her just for that?

27:10.640 --> 27:12.560
There were people
looking and laughing.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.160
Ah!

27:15.360 --> 27:17.240
Here we go. Look.

27:17.320 --> 27:19.680
"Tony Garret investigates."

27:19.760 --> 27:22.160
"Allegations rock
Calder Hill private school."

27:22.240 --> 27:23.480
What's the date on that?

27:23.560 --> 27:25.840
Er, May 4th, 2009.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.600
May 4th, 2009.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.760
And it carries on
the following week.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.760
You know, I remember this, JP.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.120
One of the teachers
was fooling around

27:35.200 --> 27:36.440
with some of his
older students.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.320
What do you reckon, Dwayne?

27:38.400 --> 27:39.560
You think this
could be the article

27:39.640 --> 27:40.720
that Tony Garret
was talking about

27:40.800 --> 27:41.920
in his resignation letter?

27:42.000 --> 27:43.800
Ah, it could be, you know.

27:43.880 --> 27:46.040
I think I'll
call the Inspector.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.880
Caught with a rum
and coconut water
at 5:00 p.m.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.480
Guilty as charged.

28:02.560 --> 28:07.040
But then,
if every police officer
looked like you...

28:07.120 --> 28:09.840
I wouldn't mind
being arrested.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.640
Unfortunately, Tony,
most police
officers look like me.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.200
(CHUCKLING)
To what do I owe the honour?

28:15.280 --> 28:16.400
Calder Hill.

28:16.480 --> 28:17.560
Who?

28:17.640 --> 28:19.400
That's the one.
And Josh Kingsley.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.560
Ah, yes, Kingsley.

28:21.640 --> 28:25.480
The handsome English teacher
and his
extra-curricular activities.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.600
Yeah.
Quite a series of articles.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.320
Were you sure those girls
were telling you the truth?

28:31.400 --> 28:34.480
The truth has many faces.
I still had to investigate.

28:34.560 --> 28:36.840
Ah,
we read them, the articles.
They were excellent.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.880
But not an awful
lot of evidence.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.840
One statement,
later retracted.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.440
I talked to a lot of people.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.240
That guy was
crossing the line.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.880
So you didn't get it wrong?

28:46.960 --> 28:48.160
No, I didn't.

28:48.240 --> 28:49.640
Hmm.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.960
Well, why then did you offer
to resign over it?

28:54.840 --> 28:56.960
Julie accused me
of embellishing the truth.

28:57.040 --> 29:00.680
Because you're lazy.
Lazy and self-satisfied,

29:00.760 --> 29:06.160
and you lied to me.
It's over for you, Tony.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.280
After all we'd been through,
she should have stuck by me.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.120
-Must have stung a bit,
though.
-Yes, it did.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.680
And two days later,
Julie is dead

29:12.760 --> 29:14.680
and your
resignation withdrawn.

29:14.760 --> 29:17.520
(LAUGHING) You
think I killed her?

29:17.600 --> 29:19.280
Oh, you couldn't have.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.720
If I remember rightly,
you were in the bar all night.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.360
Yes, I was!

29:23.440 --> 29:25.440
I could find
a dozen witnesses in an hour.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.800
Oh, there's no
need for that, Tony.
No need at all.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.200
No, we're just
tidying things up here a bit.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.880
Keep the powers
that be happy, what?

29:32.960 --> 29:36.440
Well, whatever
the rights and wrongs
of that investigation,

29:36.520 --> 29:40.240
Nadine Hunter killed Julie.
End of story.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.280
OK.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.280
Rum and coconut water. May I?

29:45.360 --> 29:46.920
Sure.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.440
Hmm. Never came
across that before.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.880
Well, you should try it.

29:50.960 --> 29:53.240
(CHUCKLES) Not on duty.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.760
Thank you.

30:02.280 --> 30:05.920
Ian Matlock, Tony Garret
both had motives.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.560
Yes, but Tony Garret
had a bar full of witnesses

30:08.640 --> 30:10.440
who all said he
was there at 8:15,

30:10.520 --> 30:12.920
the same time
Julie Matlock got shot.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.680
JP: Well, the same
goes for Ian Matlock.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.160
And there's records of a call
made from Gracie's home phone,

30:17.240 --> 30:20.600
and answered on Ian's landline
at the beach
house at 8:16 p.m.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.720
But the beach house
was a 40-minute drive

30:22.800 --> 30:24.600
from the newspaper office
where Julie was shot.

30:24.680 --> 30:26.880
Neither Ian or Tony
were anywhere near

30:26.960 --> 30:29.080
the scene of
the crime when it happened.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.840
-None of them were.
-(MOBILE RINGING)

30:30.920 --> 30:32.720
But if Nadine
Hunter's innocent,
it must be one of them.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.680
It simply must be!

30:34.760 --> 30:37.560
Er,
sir, that's my cousin Eddie.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.960
He's found a bit of kit
to isolate
the sound on that CD.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.880
-I'll head over there now.
-Great.

30:43.640 --> 30:45.480
Oh, you found her!

30:45.560 --> 30:46.920
Good man.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.280
What you doing
sneaking up on me, man?

30:48.360 --> 30:49.720
Found who?

30:49.800 --> 30:51.720
Oh, Dwayne's reconnecting
with an old flame.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.000
He had a bit of
a thing with her
in 2009.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.920
Mmm. What happened?

30:57.080 --> 30:59.040
They didn't see eye-to-eye.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.120
You think you're funny?

31:02.200 --> 31:04.160
(JP CHUCKLING)

31:15.720 --> 31:17.400
Hello.

31:17.480 --> 31:20.360
Ah, Mr McCarthy.
How are you? Come in.

31:20.440 --> 31:23.920
I was just wondering
if, er, there've
been any developments.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.880
Only I'm leaving in a day.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.520
We're progressing.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.360
So you haven't
found anything, then?

31:29.440 --> 31:30.920
Well, there's an awful lot
to get through.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.800
Forensic reports, statements,
physical evidence.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.320
The fact that it all happened
eight years ago doesn't help.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.280
No.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.160
Must have been quite a night.

31:41.240 --> 31:44.040
To bring you back here,
after all these years.

31:44.120 --> 31:47.160
It was. I've never met
anyone like her before...

31:47.800 --> 31:48.840
Or since.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.720
I don't know what I'm doing.
(LAUGHS)

31:54.800 --> 31:57.960
My marriage falls apart,
and the first thing I do is

31:58.040 --> 32:01.000
hop on a plane, chasing some
one-night stand
from years ago.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.600
(SCOFFS)

32:02.680 --> 32:04.640
My father always told me,

32:04.720 --> 32:07.960
"You never really know what
you're looking for
until you find it."

32:08.040 --> 32:09.680
Five thousand miles
is a long way to go

32:09.760 --> 32:11.040
if you don't know
what you're looking for.

32:15.360 --> 32:18.680
Well,
look, if we manage to prove
Nadine's innocence

32:18.760 --> 32:20.240
and arrest whoever did commit
that murder,

32:20.320 --> 32:22.240
well, then, I'd say
your trip hasn't been wasted.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.280
-Good night, Inspector.
-Good night.

32:37.600 --> 32:40.600
So, whoever did this
let themselves
into the building

32:40.680 --> 32:42.560
and then shot Julie

32:42.640 --> 32:44.920
while she was on the phone
leaving a message
for her daughter.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.120
We know they then removed
all signs of the killing,

32:49.200 --> 32:52.280
cleaned up the crime scene
and disposed of the body.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.360
Where that body is
is something we don't know.

32:59.160 --> 33:03.240
We also know that
Nadine Hunter's car
was pushed into the sea.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.040
But when it was recovered,

33:05.120 --> 33:07.680
all that we could find
was the potential
murder weapon

33:07.760 --> 33:09.080
and the victim's
bloodied scarf,

33:09.160 --> 33:11.000
which would indicate
that whoever did this

33:11.080 --> 33:13.880
was trying to
frame Nadine Hunter
for the murder.

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

33:18.640 --> 33:20.160

33:20.240 --> 33:22.680
Which begs the question,
why her?

33:22.760 --> 33:26.360
Why kill Julie Matlock
and then frame Nadine for it?

33:26.440 --> 33:28.320
Maybe,
somehow, they knew Nadine

33:28.400 --> 33:30.400
would struggle to
prove her alibi.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.600
Maybe.

33:32.680 --> 33:34.080
But now that's no
longer the case.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.000
The playing field
has been levelled.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.680
Leaving us with four people,
all of whom
might have done it.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.560
But they can all prove
they were somewhere else

33:40.640 --> 33:42.320
at the time that
Julie was killed.

33:43.320 --> 33:44.880
(SIGHS) Hmm.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.160

like something mechanical.

34:04.760 --> 34:07.360
Hmm. Or someone tapping?

34:07.440 --> 34:09.240
No, no, no, it's a horse.

34:09.320 --> 34:10.440
A horse?

34:10.520 --> 34:11.560
Yes.

it out any more?

Port Royal,
that's a place in the island,
right?

34:30.720 --> 34:33.320
Yes, it's a small harbour town
on the northern coast.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.600
Yeah. And we know
that Julie Matlock
was there for a short time,

34:35.680 --> 34:36.760
the day she was murdered.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.720
That's right.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.600
A taxi driver gave a statement
that he took
Julie to Port Royal.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.520
She asked him to wait for her.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.160
He said it was
just about 15 minutes.

34:45.240 --> 34:47.040
Then he drove her
back to her office.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.840
Did we ever establish
what she was doing there?

34:48.920 --> 34:49.960
No.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.200
OK.

34:51.280 --> 34:52.880
Look,
I know it's a long time ago,

34:52.960 --> 34:55.160
but it's about the only thing
we haven't double-checked.

34:55.240 --> 34:56.480
Why don't we go there?

34:56.560 --> 34:59.440

She didn't believe
that you were
a reformed character.

She was looking for proof.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.040
Looks like she found it.

Yeah.

still hanging
around with those fellas.

36:55.960 --> 36:58.320
Our point is, Kai,
if you knew about this,

36:58.400 --> 37:01.880
you had a powerful motive
to kill Julie.

37:01.960 --> 37:04.480
Of course I knew
Julie was trying
to get rid of me.

37:04.560 --> 37:07.080
She begged Grace to dump me.
She was desperate.

37:09.040 --> 37:10.880

tried to pay me off.

37:14.280 --> 37:16.760

She may have banged on
about getting
people out of the gutter,

37:19.640 --> 37:23.040
until a piece of gutter trash
got anywhere
near her or Grace.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.520
And did you tell Grace
that Julie tried
to buy you off?

37:25.600 --> 37:29.320
Yes, and she was furious.

away from it for good.

about these pictures?

think I killed her?

are all over them.

she did something like that.

that if she gave
them to the police,

got him into trouble,
she'd lose me forever.

that Julie had these?

would do something like this?

didn't you want to warn him?

39:23.280 --> 39:25.480
I didn't need
a photo to do that.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.240
Let's just say
that I made it clear

39:27.320 --> 39:28.920
that if I ever
caught him dealing,

39:29.000 --> 39:30.240
I'd leave him.

loved me, he'd stop.

42:46.520 --> 42:49.280
I can't believe
I mixed them up.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.960
Monica Ridley is the model,
the one taller than me,

42:52.040 --> 42:53.920
and the other one
is Monica Canon,

42:54.000 --> 42:55.840
whose father
was in the circus.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.200
Circus?

42:57.280 --> 42:58.480
It's a long story.

42:58.560 --> 43:02.320
Or a short one. Oh!

43:02.400 --> 43:04.720
I wonder what Saint Ursula
would have made
of all of this?

43:04.800 --> 43:06.880
-What?
-Saint Ursula.

43:06.960 --> 43:08.800
No, thanks, sir,
I ate earlier.

43:10.320 --> 43:11.800
Are you
enjoying yourself, Dad?

43:11.880 --> 43:13.680
-Yeah.
-Good.

43:13.760 --> 43:15.360
They could turn the music
down a bit, though.

43:15.440 --> 43:16.800
What?

43:16.880 --> 43:18.160
The music, very loud.

43:18.240 --> 43:19.560
It's very what?

43:19.640 --> 43:20.880
Loud!

43:20.960 --> 43:22.680
Loud. It's very...

43:22.760 --> 43:24.600
JULIE: I'm probably
gonna be here another...

43:24.680 --> 43:26.120
-(GUNSHOT)
-Good Lord!

43:28.440 --> 43:31.640
Something there, isn't there,
in the background?

43:31.720 --> 43:34.000
Forensics found
significant traces of bleach

43:34.080 --> 43:35.680
on and around
her desk and chair.

43:36.400 --> 43:37.360
A lock of hair?

43:40.440 --> 43:43.200
What is it? Are you OK, Dad?

43:43.280 --> 43:45.120
That's it! I've got it!

43:45.200 --> 43:46.480
Got what?

43:46.560 --> 43:48.320
Oh, thank you, Saint Ursula.

43:48.400 --> 43:51.240
Right.
JP, we need to run a DNA test.

43:51.320 --> 43:52.840
-Dwayne?
-Huh?

43:52.920 --> 43:55.360
We need something called
a structural imaging radar.

43:55.440 --> 43:56.680
Fire Service might have one.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.640
But it's almost midnight!

43:58.720 --> 44:00.520
Well,
wake up whoever we need to.
This has to be done tonight.

44:00.600 --> 44:02.320
-(GROANS)
-Ooh!

44:02.400 --> 44:03.600
Siobhan.

44:03.680 --> 44:04.840
It's fine, Dad. Go.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.640
Catch you at home.

44:27.440 --> 44:29.200
-You OK, sir?
-Yeah.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.800
Oh, good,
the Commissioner is here.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.680
Question.

44:40.760 --> 44:43.520
How many saints are there
in the Catholic Church?

44:46.920 --> 44:48.560
Go on, have a guess.

44:48.640 --> 44:49.680
IAN: A thousand?

44:49.760 --> 44:52.520
10,221, at the last count.

44:52.600 --> 44:54.560
There's so many of them,
it's hard to tell
who's who any more.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.960
Take yesterday,
Saint Ursula's Day.

44:57.040 --> 44:58.360
Well, which Ursula?

44:58.440 --> 45:00.120
There's at least
two that I know about.

45:00.200 --> 45:01.800
The one who was
martyred by the Hun,

45:01.880 --> 45:04.600
and the other one
who had the gift
of bi-location.

45:04.680 --> 45:07.880
Sorry, but have we come here
for a theology lesson?

45:07.960 --> 45:10.160
No, sorry, Tony. Not at all.

45:10.240 --> 45:12.600
We're here because
the killer of Julie Matlock

45:12.680 --> 45:15.040
also had
the gift of bi-location.

45:15.120 --> 45:17.720
They were in two
places at once.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.720
See, there are two
victims in this case.

45:19.800 --> 45:24.000
There's Julie Matlock,
demanding editor,
fiercely protective mother,

45:24.080 --> 45:25.600
domineering wife.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.600
And there was
also Nadine Hunter,

45:27.680 --> 45:29.920
a charismatic
but haunted woman.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.240
Born under an unlucky star.

45:32.320 --> 45:36.080
Depression, alcoholism,
a college sweetheart
buried in the past.

45:36.160 --> 45:37.600
And then, to cap it all off,

45:37.680 --> 45:39.840
she's convicted for a murder
she did not commit.

45:41.200 --> 45:42.200
Did not?

45:42.280 --> 45:43.840
No.

45:43.920 --> 45:46.680
I believe that Nadine Hunter
is innocent of the crime.

45:49.600 --> 45:52.640
What do we know
about the real killer,
whoever that might be?

45:53.720 --> 45:55.360
What do we know about them?

45:55.440 --> 45:58.160
Well, for a start,
they had a key
to this building.

45:58.240 --> 45:59.920
And they also knew
that Julie was working late

46:00.000 --> 46:01.840
the evening she disappeared.

46:01.920 --> 46:05.040
In other words,
it had to be one of you.

46:05.120 --> 46:07.000
-Come on.
-Oh, for God's sakes!

46:07.080 --> 46:11.200
No, no,
despite the protestations,
you all had motives.

46:11.280 --> 46:14.880
But, and here's the thing,
all of you can
prove beyond doubt

46:14.960 --> 46:16.680
that you were not
in this building

46:16.760 --> 46:20.600
at 8:15 p.m. on Thursday,
the 22nd of June, 2009.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.360
Saint Ursula's Day.

46:23.440 --> 46:25.160
Exactly.
So, why are we here then?

46:25.240 --> 46:28.200
We're here because
I want to play you something.

46:28.280 --> 46:30.600
This is the background noise

46:30.680 --> 46:34.280
on the message that Julie left
on Grace's answer phone.

46:35.720 --> 46:37.800
If you could just
listen for a moment.

46:39.560 --> 46:41.560
(TAPPING)

46:47.160 --> 46:49.120
Hmm. Sounds like a metronome.

46:49.200 --> 46:51.120
Or someone tapping?

46:51.200 --> 46:53.520
Now, just leaving aside
what you do hear,

46:53.600 --> 46:54.680
what don't you hear?

46:57.400 --> 47:00.080
What you don't hear
is music and singing,

47:00.160 --> 47:03.520
and thousands of people out in
the street
celebrating Saint Ursula.

47:03.600 --> 47:06.120
The carnival passes
right along this street here.

47:06.200 --> 47:09.520
It's so loud, my ears are
still ringing from last night.

47:09.600 --> 47:12.280
Yet there are no
carnival sounds here.

47:12.360 --> 47:16.960
See, the grill was open,
but not a peep.

47:17.040 --> 47:18.480
I'm sorry. You've lost me now.

47:18.560 --> 47:22.400
My apologies, Ian.
I'll try and get to the point.

47:22.480 --> 47:26.480
It's true that
none of you were here
on that fateful evening.

47:26.560 --> 47:28.360
But then, here's the thing,
neither was Julie.

47:28.440 --> 47:29.720
But she was.

47:29.800 --> 47:32.840
Well, this is what
I couldn't quite get.

47:32.920 --> 47:36.200
Our killer,
who was under such
extraordinary time pressure,

47:36.280 --> 47:38.080
decided to clean
up after themselves,

47:38.160 --> 47:41.280
lugging a dead weight
down the corridor
and into the lift,

47:41.360 --> 47:43.200
and then waiting
for an opportune moment

47:43.280 --> 47:46.080
to drag the body outside
and put it in
the boot of a car.

47:46.160 --> 47:49.320
(SCOFFS) Why
would they do that?

47:49.400 --> 47:52.120
I was thinking
about this for ages.

47:52.200 --> 47:54.320
It wasn't until I realised

47:54.400 --> 47:57.760
what it was you couldn't hear
in the background noises,

47:57.840 --> 47:59.640
the carnival,

47:59.720 --> 48:00.880
and then, it suddenly twigged.

48:00.960 --> 48:03.320
It was like, bingo!

48:03.400 --> 48:06.400
The killer wanted us to think
that Julie was killed here,

48:06.480 --> 48:07.680
but she wasn't.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.360
But why would someone do that?

48:09.440 --> 48:10.880
Oh,
to give themselves an alibi.

48:11.920 --> 48:13.880
It was a stroke of genius.

48:13.960 --> 48:18.640
Hold on.
On the answer phone message,
Mum says she's in the office.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.080
Well, that's another example
of the killer's genius.

48:21.160 --> 48:24.680
We're dealing with
a very creative
individual here.

48:24.760 --> 48:29.560
But unfortunately for them,
they made one
tiny little mistake.

48:29.640 --> 48:33.040
That sound on
the answer phone message
gives them away.

48:37.400 --> 48:38.840
(TAPPING)

48:41.040 --> 48:42.640
Now trust me,
we spent an awful lot of

48:42.720 --> 48:44.240
time trying to
figure out what that was.

48:44.320 --> 48:45.840
Oh, yeah.

48:45.920 --> 48:47.800
We went through
the whole shooting shebang,

48:47.880 --> 48:51.400
rumbles and mechanical sounds.
A horse even
made an appearance.

48:51.480 --> 48:55.400
It rang
a distant bell with me,
but I couldn't quite place it.

48:57.920 --> 48:59.640
My dad was very
good with his hands.

48:59.720 --> 49:02.440
When I was about 10,
he built an extension
onto our house.

49:02.520 --> 49:04.200
My granny had
come to live with us,

49:04.280 --> 49:05.800
and my sister,
she couldn't carry on

49:05.880 --> 49:08.200
sleeping on
the couch forever now,
could she?

49:08.280 --> 49:10.120
Anyway,
to cut a long story short,

49:10.200 --> 49:12.880
I used to help him
out at the weekends.

49:12.960 --> 49:15.120
And I remember
shovelling
cement into a mixer.

49:16.880 --> 49:19.640
And that's what that sound is,
a cement mixer.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.920
Yeah.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.640
Now, where would Julie be
anywhere near a cement mixer?

49:24.720 --> 49:27.280
They were close to finishing
a beach house on the coast

49:27.360 --> 49:29.040
when Mrs Matlock was murdered.

49:31.760 --> 49:34.880
At the beach house. (CHUCKLES)

49:34.960 --> 49:38.080
The one you'd been
building yourselves.

49:38.160 --> 49:39.440
Which is where you shot her,

49:39.520 --> 49:40.800
Ian.

49:44.880 --> 49:47.680
The exact movements
of yourself and Julie

49:47.760 --> 49:50.440
on that evening will only
ever be known by you.

49:51.440 --> 49:53.240
But one thing's for sure,

49:53.320 --> 49:55.360
when Julie was done at work,
you picked her up
from the office.

49:57.960 --> 49:59.200
But not before
you manufactured

49:59.280 --> 50:01.200
some excuse to
slip back in here

50:01.280 --> 50:04.120
and wipe down that
desk with bleach.

50:04.200 --> 50:08.080
To make it
appear as if somebody
had cleaned up after a murder.

50:08.160 --> 50:09.600
In the absence of
the police finding

50:09.680 --> 50:11.040
a body,
this was the next best thing.

50:12.800 --> 50:15.440
You then drove back
to the beach house,

50:15.520 --> 50:19.200
where you persuaded Julie
to cancel her
dinner date with Grace.

50:19.280 --> 50:21.120
I imagine it was
something along

50:21.200 --> 50:22.960
the lines of,
"Give her more space,"

50:23.040 --> 50:24.880
or, "The more you push her,
the more you'll
drive her away,"

50:24.960 --> 50:26.520
that sort of thing.

50:26.600 --> 50:29.160
You then tell
Julie to phone Grace

50:29.240 --> 50:31.760
and say that she
was working late
at the office.

50:31.840 --> 50:33.440
Just tell her
you're still at work.

50:33.520 --> 50:35.720
JACK:
So, Julie picks up the phone,

50:35.800 --> 50:39.360
and you wait,
while she tells Grace
this lie about where she is.

50:40.080 --> 50:41.360
Hi, Gracie.

50:41.440 --> 50:42.760
Look, I know I said
we should do dinner,

50:42.840 --> 50:44.800
but guess what?
I'm still at the office.

50:44.880 --> 50:46.560
-I'm probably gonna
be here another...
-(GUNSHOT)

50:50.160 --> 50:52.440
This... This is just mad.

50:56.520 --> 50:57.840
Dad?

50:59.240 --> 51:01.280
This makes no sense.

51:01.360 --> 51:03.320
Why would I do any of this?

51:03.400 --> 51:04.960
Well, you told us
yourself that your

51:05.040 --> 51:06.480
marriage had got
into a bit of a rut.

51:06.560 --> 51:08.000
Although, if I'm honest,

51:08.080 --> 51:09.800
it wasn't my
marriage in a rut,
it was me.

51:11.160 --> 51:13.320
Hmm.

51:13.400 --> 51:15.080
JACK: The fact that
you were having an affair,

51:15.160 --> 51:17.840
it makes me think it
was more than that.

51:17.920 --> 51:20.760
You were unhappy.
An unhappy man.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.120
Fed up with your
marriage to Julie.

51:23.600 --> 51:25.040
And that's why you strayed.

51:26.200 --> 51:29.200
But this summer fling you had,

51:29.280 --> 51:32.640
it wasn't with some travel rep
whose name you can't recall.

51:32.720 --> 51:34.160
No.

51:35.280 --> 51:36.480
It was Nadine Hunter.

51:39.480 --> 51:42.360
But for Nadine,
it wasn't just a fling.

51:42.440 --> 51:44.440
She was head over heels
in love with you.

51:46.680 --> 51:51.560
And for a woman like Nadine,
love is all-consuming,
intense, extreme.

51:53.560 --> 51:54.960
(SIGHS)

51:55.040 --> 51:58.160
She kept this lock of hair
in her prison cell.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.920
It was one of
the few things she had.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.760
We were wondering
whether she had a child,

52:01.840 --> 52:03.480
or was it
a college sweetheart's...

52:03.560 --> 52:07.120
And then, the penny dropped
and we ran a DNA test.

52:07.200 --> 52:09.680
It's yours, Ian.
This is your hair.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.200
(SIGHS)

52:15.400 --> 52:18.160
But,
of course, you didn't feel
the same way about Nadine.

52:18.240 --> 52:21.320
She was erratic and unstable,
more so now that
she was in love.

52:21.400 --> 52:24.200
So, when she stormed
into the restaurant
that you and Julie were at...

52:24.280 --> 52:26.480
You'll pay for this!

52:26.560 --> 52:28.720
JACK:
You ushered her out of there,
out of the restaurant.

52:28.800 --> 52:32.960
She's emotional.
Well, she's in no
fit state to drive.

52:33.040 --> 52:36.960
And that's
probably when you got
a hold of the car keys.

52:37.040 --> 52:38.480
So, you get her into a cab.

52:41.800 --> 52:45.320
It's unsettling, or maybe
you're thinking
she'll calm down

52:45.400 --> 52:49.080
and she might
sober up and realise
it's all over between you,

52:49.160 --> 52:51.320
but she came to
the office the next day.

52:51.400 --> 52:53.200
We're not finished!

52:53.280 --> 52:55.040
JACK:
You see, everybody thought
she was talking to Julie,

52:55.120 --> 52:57.840
but it was you
she was speaking to.

52:57.920 --> 53:00.080
You knew you had
to do something.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.840
If the truth
about you and
Nadine came out...

53:03.480 --> 53:04.560
Well, that was it.

53:06.000 --> 53:07.640
Julie was not
a woman to cross.

53:07.720 --> 53:09.320
You'd literally be
left with nothing,

53:09.400 --> 53:13.000
no house, no fancy motorbike.
You had to think quickly.

53:13.080 --> 53:16.040
You knew where
Nadine's car was.

53:16.120 --> 53:18.600
You also knew she
kept a gun in her car.

53:18.680 --> 53:20.960
So after the murder,

53:21.040 --> 53:23.240
you place the weapon

53:23.320 --> 53:27.160
and Julie's bloodied scarf
in Nadine's car

53:27.240 --> 53:28.600
before pushing
it into the sea.

53:33.880 --> 53:37.320
You saw your
problem with Nadine
as an opportunity.

53:37.400 --> 53:40.400
An opportunity
to bring to an end
your unhappy marriage,

53:40.480 --> 53:44.280
and also to get
rid of the mistress
you'd lost interest in.

53:44.360 --> 53:46.120
Leaving you to continue
living in the manner

53:46.200 --> 53:48.560
to which you'd
grown accustomed.

53:48.640 --> 53:50.480
All you had to do
was get rid of the two

53:50.560 --> 53:52.280
women in your life,
Julie and Nadine.

53:53.840 --> 53:56.560
Kill one and frame the other.

53:58.920 --> 54:01.840
Everything you've
just said is based on

54:01.920 --> 54:04.680
conjecture and
circumstantial evidence.

54:05.560 --> 54:07.480
Uh... No.

54:07.560 --> 54:08.840
Not strictly true.

54:11.080 --> 54:12.520
(SIGHS)

54:18.880 --> 54:21.360
These are scans
that we just ran of the

54:21.440 --> 54:23.840
foundations of your
house and grounds.

54:25.800 --> 54:30.280
And underneath the veranda
of the house you and she built

54:30.360 --> 54:32.120
lies the body
of Julie Matlock.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.600
(KAI SIGHS)

54:35.680 --> 54:37.760
Quite literally
concrete proof.

54:40.920 --> 54:43.360
(SNIFFING) Say it's not true.

54:47.320 --> 54:49.120
Dad... (SNIFFING)

54:49.200 --> 54:53.200
(SIGHS) Dwayne, JP,
will you please
do the honours?

55:00.000 --> 55:01.440
(HANDCUFFS CLICKING)

55:16.040 --> 55:17.640
Good work, Inspector.

55:21.680 --> 55:23.280
(JACK SIGHS)

55:23.360 --> 55:24.880
Well done, sir. You did it.

55:24.960 --> 55:26.200
We did it.

55:31.160 --> 55:33.720
-(EXHALES)
-So...

55:33.800 --> 55:36.600
Whatever happened to, uh,
Monica Ridley?

55:36.680 --> 55:39.200
Who, her? I looked her up.

55:39.280 --> 55:40.800
Married, with four kids.

55:40.880 --> 55:42.280
Oh.

55:42.360 --> 55:46.320
Ah, well. Maybe she named
one of them Dwayne.

55:46.400 --> 55:48.720
You're not funny, you know.

55:48.800 --> 55:50.760
Maybe she just wasn't the one.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.160
Mmm.

55:56.680 --> 55:58.040
I'll get over it.

55:58.120 --> 55:59.280
That didn't take long.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.440
Hmm.

56:00.520 --> 56:01.880
You better believe it.

56:02.720 --> 56:03.680
(CHUCKLES)

56:06.600 --> 56:07.920
Ah!

56:08.000 --> 56:10.920
So, you solved your first case
on Saint Marie.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.680
SELWYN: Good evening.

56:12.760 --> 56:15.120
Look who I found on the way.

56:15.200 --> 56:16.200
A charming young lady.

56:16.280 --> 56:17.560
(GIGGLES)

56:17.640 --> 56:19.280
I hear you solved the case.
Well done, Dad.

56:19.360 --> 56:21.960
Ah, no, no.
Very much a team effort.

56:22.040 --> 56:24.440
Congratulations,
Inspector Mooney.

56:24.520 --> 56:26.240
Very tenacious work.

56:26.320 --> 56:29.880
Yeah, well,
I can be quite tenacious,
if I may say so.

56:29.960 --> 56:31.480
You have to be
when you're a parent.

56:31.560 --> 56:33.920
Creeping in from the Festival
at 4:00 this morning.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.280
She thinks I don't know.

56:35.360 --> 56:36.640
You were asleep.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.640
So you see,
Commissioner, tenacity,

56:38.720 --> 56:41.080
minimum
requirement in our house.

56:41.160 --> 56:43.400
You called it "our house,"
the shack.

56:43.480 --> 56:45.680
It's a figure of speech.

56:45.760 --> 56:48.720
You will be
staying a little longer,
though, won't you?

56:51.800 --> 56:54.240
Why is everyone looking at me?

56:54.320 --> 56:56.280
Drinks for everyone.

56:56.360 --> 56:58.080
-(CHUCKLES)
-It's about time.

56:58.160 --> 57:00.240
(LAUGHING)

57:00.320 --> 57:02.760
Cheers to an amazing team!

57:02.840 --> 57:03.800
Well done.

57:07.720 --> 57:09.520
CATHERINE: I hope I can count
on your vote today.

57:09.600 --> 57:10.680
Who else would I vote for?

57:10.760 --> 57:12.160
(GRUNTING)

57:12.240 --> 57:13.920
JACK: Mayoral
candidate Victor Pearce

57:14.000 --> 57:15.880
was casting his vote
when one these suspects

57:15.960 --> 57:18.040
managed to stick
a knife in his back.

57:18.120 --> 57:21.280
That only leaves one person.
Catherine Bordey.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.760
Siobhan, that lizard's back!

57:23.840 --> 57:25.840
SIOBHAN: He's called Harry.

57:25.920 --> 57:28.160
Maybe someone
should level
the playing field.

57:28.240 --> 57:29.920
There's
something I really need
to go and do first.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.120
What's that?

57:31.200 --> 57:32.400
Catch a killer.

57:32.480 --> 57:34.440
