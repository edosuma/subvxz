00:00.100 --> 00:01.635
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:01.702 --> 00:04.405
If you can't deliver,
then maybe you should step aside.

00:04.471 --> 00:08.141
I have a daughter who'd rather see Pat
Buchanan in office than her old lady.

00:08.209 --> 00:11.779
You want to be president because you
want the power to control the universe!

00:11.845 --> 00:13.881
- That's not me.
- That's the problem.

00:13.948 --> 00:16.317
If you are incapable
of traveling the high road,

00:16.383 --> 00:19.587
- I don't want you representing me.
- Mr. Speaker, your star intern.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.255
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

00:21.322 --> 00:24.024
- When are you declaring?
- Mustn't get ahead of ourselves.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.760
Have you given any thought
to who will be your next VP?

00:26.827 --> 00:28.329
- What about you?
- Me?

00:28.395 --> 00:29.597
Think about it.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.238
I like this artist's work.

00:37.304 --> 00:41.809
Hmm. Serious, but warm.
I wonder what he's holding.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.444
Eviction notice?

00:43.510 --> 00:45.713
I don't really need
to decide this now, do I?

00:45.779 --> 00:49.183
Well, any artist you choose
is going to need multiple sittings.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.920
- There's not that much time left.
- Ah, my little ray of sunshine.

00:52.987 --> 00:56.223
Good to get your portrait in
the gallery sooner than later,

00:56.290 --> 00:59.493
cement the notion of you being
part of history, not a flash in the pan.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.062
Ma'am, they're ready for you
in the town hall prep.

01:02.129 --> 01:04.965
- Thank you. You guys coming?
- Uh, yeah. Just a sec.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.303
She should definitely wear
a dress or a skirt.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.505
'Cause she's the president
with hot legs?

01:11.572 --> 01:14.675
No, so she's perceived
as strong but feminine.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.978
I know it sucks, but I'm right.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.983
- Why are we here?
- To ask sample questions.

01:23.050 --> 01:26.220
You know, help her prep
for this whole "get out the vote" thing.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.589
The university hosts it every year.

01:28.656 --> 01:31.425
So these sample questions,
where are they?

01:31.492 --> 01:33.761
In our minds.
We're supposed to make them up.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.296
It's not too late to cancel.

01:35.362 --> 01:37.698
Impossible.
It's been on the books for months.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.533
White House always participates.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.703
He still beefing about this?
It's a non-partisan event.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.805
But it should be a presidential event.

01:44.872 --> 01:48.142
You suggest we un-invite the
senate majority leader and speaker?

01:48.208 --> 01:51.312
Mackenzie Allen'll leave with
the same cachet she had going in.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.747
Anybody else gets elevated
standing next to her.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.283
- Does more for their numbers than ours.
- Hello.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.919
- [Jim] Madam President.
- Please, please.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.988
Hi, guys. Thanks for coming.

02:01.055 --> 02:02.356
- Sure.
- No problem.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.726
The point of the town hall
is to encourage young people to vote,

02:05.793 --> 02:07.961
not to get a bump in the polls.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.663
- So, shall we?
- OK.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.232
[Mac] Yes.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.135
If you run for reelection,
who will be your running mate,

02:15.202 --> 02:18.339
and what party will he or she
be a member of?

02:18.405 --> 02:21.742
Well, I haven't made a decision
about my vice president yet,

02:21.809 --> 02:23.811
but party affiliation won't matter.

02:23.877 --> 02:28.115
What I'm looking for is someone
who has integrity, who has vision,

02:28.182 --> 02:32.119
- and who has had their appendix out.
- [audience chuckles]

02:33.120 --> 02:35.322
[Sarah] They just came in.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.928
You don't think we're
jumping the gun with this?

02:40.994 --> 02:45.733
- Nathan, stop stalling.
- [Jayne] Your numbers went up

02:45.799 --> 02:48.202
16 percent since our stay
in the White House.

02:48.268 --> 02:51.705
- He thinks we should capitalize on it.
- Lance is going by polls.

02:51.772 --> 02:55.476
I hate polls, Jayne.
I can't... I'm too old.

02:55.542 --> 02:59.012
- You're not old.
- I'm too old-fashioned.

02:59.079 --> 03:02.483
I think you're being incredibly
short-sighted about this process.

03:02.549 --> 03:06.253
- With all due respect.
- Didn't sound very respectful to me.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.088
Well, we need someone like him.

03:08.155 --> 03:10.424
We're going up against an incumbent.

03:10.491 --> 03:14.161
We need more than by-the-book
strategies and matching funds, you know?

03:14.228 --> 03:15.963
We need an attack dog.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.899
- [sighs]
- I think the one in the middle is good.

03:20.534 --> 03:24.138
Put it this way, the reality is,
if we allow the greenhouse effect

03:24.204 --> 03:26.974
that's caused by human activity
to go unchecked,

03:27.040 --> 03:30.978
it's like putting more and more blankets
on a patient who already has a fever.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.281
Horace? How'd I do with that one?

03:34.348 --> 03:37.618
Um... I wasn't listening. Sorry.

03:37.684 --> 03:41.422
OK, how 'bout you ask me a question
that you do want to know the answer to.

03:41.488 --> 03:45.492
- Can I get tickets to Nickelback?
- [audience laughs]

03:45.559 --> 03:47.594
Yes.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.531
When did you vote
in your first presidential election,

03:50.597 --> 03:54.468
- and who did you vote for?
- 1980, John Anderson.

03:54.535 --> 03:58.639
I guess my Independent streak
was showing even back then.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.707
How do you feel
about Affirmative Action?

04:02.209 --> 04:05.612
As a university chancellor,
I had firsthand experience

04:05.679 --> 04:08.749
with the flaws and benefits
of that program.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.884
People of color
are not on equal footing.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.119
So you're for it?

04:12.186 --> 04:14.688
Excuse me, ma'am? Sorry to interrupt.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.858
- [Jim] Is there a problem?
- Vernon Rubino died.

04:17.925 --> 04:21.327
Rubino, the speaker of the Illinois
House of Representatives.

04:21.394 --> 04:22.729
- For 40 years.
- Remember.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.966
He wouldn't attend the convention
'cause Bridges nominated me.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.202
Didn't want a bra-burner
in the White House.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.970
And all this matters because…?

04:30.037 --> 04:32.973
- Because now, Illinois can ratify it.
- The ERA.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.242
[Mac] I want staff
to meet in the morning.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.845
We're going to amend the Constitution.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.998
[Mac] Unfortunately,
voter apathy is at an all-time high,

04:58.065 --> 05:00.234
especially among young voters.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.570
But maybe you'll help me
convince them to use their voices.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.838
- [all shouting]
- Luis.

05:04.905 --> 05:08.041
Madam President, is your attendance
at George Mason University

05:08.108 --> 05:10.711
meant as an appeal to vote for you
in the next election?

05:10.777 --> 05:14.381
No, it's meant as an appeal
to vote in every election.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.516
- [all shout]
- Barry.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.251
President Allen, were you aware

05:17.317 --> 05:19.720
of Illinois Speaker
Vernon Rubino's passing?

05:19.786 --> 05:23.357
Yes. I called the Rubino family
last night to express my condolences.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.559
He was a legendary figure in

05:25.626 --> 05:28.128
Illinois politics and
a real champion of his state.

05:28.195 --> 05:32.566
And he was also an outspoken critic
of the Equal Rights Amendment.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.835
Does your administration
view his passing

05:34.902 --> 05:37.638
as an opportunity to revisit the issue?

05:39.239 --> 05:42.843
In the Declaration of Independence,
the first truth to be

05:42.910 --> 05:46.280
held as self-evident
is that all men are created equal.

05:46.346 --> 05:50.284
Since women didn't win the right to vote
until about a century and a half later,

05:50.350 --> 05:53.921
I'm afraid we have to assume
that they did mean men.

05:53.987 --> 05:59.459
Now, we can't amend the Declaration,
but we can and must amend

05:59.526 --> 06:03.263
the Constitution to ensure
women have equal rights.

06:03.330 --> 06:06.199
Madam President, so are we
to understand that you are

06:06.266 --> 06:09.970
putting the ERA back
on the national agenda?

06:10.037 --> 06:13.774
- Yes.
- [crowd murmurs]

06:16.176 --> 06:19.313
When Congress submitted the
Equal Rights Amendment in 1972,

06:19.379 --> 06:23.216
35 states passed it, leaving it
three states shy of the 38 needed

06:23.283 --> 06:25.752
- for Constitutional ratification.
- Morning.

06:27.321 --> 06:30.324
- Mission accomplished.
- I take it you got the ERA question?

06:30.390 --> 06:34.027
- Hard not to when Kelly plants it.
- How was it received?

06:34.094 --> 06:35.796
Uh, with surprise and confusion.

06:35.862 --> 06:38.732
They're all going to be
boning up on it, that's for sure.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.668
We're clear about the 35 states we have?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.937
States have the power
to ratify, not rescind,

06:44.004 --> 06:45.806
so the 35 that we have, we keep.

06:45.872 --> 06:48.842
All right. Can anyone explain
how the Illinois speaker dying

06:48.909 --> 06:51.511
convinces the state
to pick up a 30-year-old issue?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.080
Yeah. It's an ongoing issue.

06:53.146 --> 06:56.850
ERA legislation's passed the Illinois
Senate and is currently in its House.

06:56.917 --> 07:00.354
- Rubino was the only roadblock.
- A new speaker will be in place soon,

07:00.420 --> 07:02.522
hopefully, one more open
to the amendment.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.092
I served in Congress
with the governor of Illinois.

07:05.158 --> 07:08.328
I'll see if he's up for horse-trading
with some of the holdouts.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.764
Missouri is within reach.
I can call the speaker.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.199
He has a fair amount of pull.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.401
If we get those states,
we just need one more.

07:14.468 --> 07:19.373
- Talk to me about Florida.
- A state Templeton all but owns.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.742
ERA legislation's stuck
in Senate committee.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.977
Majority leader's blocked it
at every turn.

07:24.044 --> 07:27.047
- What do we know about him?
- Her. Christine Chambers.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.016
Rising star of the Republican Party.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.885
Young, dynamic.
Eyes on the governor's mansion.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.488
Jim, let's see if we can get
Ms. Chambers in here

07:34.554 --> 07:36.757
as soon as possible.
I want to talk to her.

07:38.358 --> 07:41.461
- There she is. Got a sec?
- Uh, sure. What's up?

07:41.528 --> 07:43.997
I spoke to Eric Connors at
the Sunday Times Magazine

07:44.064 --> 07:46.500
and he wants the magazine to do
a story on Mac and me.

07:46.566 --> 07:49.002
"A presidential marriage,"
something like that.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.105
- You run this by the president?
- Eric should've spoken to you,

07:52.172 --> 07:54.174
but we've been friends since college.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.343
He felt more comfortable
pitching it to me.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.278
- I hope you don't mind.
- No. Not at all.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.814
- Who's the writer?
- A guy named Jeremy Dobris.

08:00.881 --> 08:04.017
- You know him?
- Yeah. You want me to set up a meeting?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.385
No need. He's here.

08:07.587 --> 08:10.023
Mr. Dobris, I'd like you to meet...

08:10.090 --> 08:13.026
- Hello, Kelly.
- How are you, Jeremy?

08:13.093 --> 08:14.895
Well, so much for introductions.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.698
Uh, we go back, uh…
What? Eight years?

08:17.764 --> 08:20.901
We met when Kelly worked
Esther Chamberlain's House campaign

08:20.967 --> 08:23.136
- for Virginia's third district.
- Fourth.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.405
Jeremy covered the race
for The New Republic.

08:25.472 --> 08:28.575
- First national press we got.
- That should make things easier.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.912
Jeremy's gonna be interviewing
and observing the next few weeks.

08:31.978 --> 08:33.413
He should know his way around.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.650
- I was wondering if you would just...
- Give him the tour? Sure.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.820
- Great. See you two later.
- Thank you, sir.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.525
You son of a bitch!

08:45.992 --> 08:48.228
[chiming]

08:48.295 --> 08:50.597
[keys clicking]

08:54.301 --> 08:56.970
- [chiming]
- [scoffs] You need a silencer on that.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.340
- Yeah. And you need to read a book.
- Sorry I'm not a brainiac like you.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.709
Well, at least
I put some time into my studying.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.679
- You wonder why you don't get dates.
- [Rebecca sighs]

09:05.746 --> 09:08.515
- [television chatter]
- You watching this, Grandma?

09:08.582 --> 09:10.684
Oh, yes, as a matter of fact,
I am, dear.

09:10.751 --> 09:14.921
- [woman] Just what is the ERA?
- Irish terrorist group, right?

09:14.988 --> 09:18.358
- Oh, for God's sake...
- [woman] Laundry detergent, I think.

09:18.425 --> 09:23.296
Since 1972,
35 states have ratified the ERA.

09:23.363 --> 09:27.067
Some experts claim if just
three more states were to ratify

09:27.134 --> 09:29.603
the amendment,
it's likely to become law.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.438
Grandma, I can't hear myself think.

09:31.505 --> 09:34.674
Well, perhaps you
should be listening to this.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.443
Why?

09:37.344 --> 09:40.013
Have you ever heard
of a glass ceiling?

09:40.080 --> 09:43.116
Oh, I love those.
You can see right up to the sky.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.185
Not what she meant, squirt.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.421
Just because it matters to Mom,
doesn't mean it matters to me.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.157
I mean, I'm no feminist.

09:50.223 --> 09:55.996
So you don't believe that women should
have rights equal to those of men?

09:56.062 --> 09:57.964
Well, of course I do. It's just...

09:58.031 --> 10:00.667
Well, then might I suggest, my dear,

10:00.734 --> 10:04.237
that you look up
the definition of feminist.

10:10.076 --> 10:13.180
No mention of the article?
That you're coming to the White House?

10:13.246 --> 10:15.182
I would've told you
if you'd called back.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.884
It's the first message
I get from you in seven years.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.086
You think I'd pick up
and say, "How you been?"

10:20.153 --> 10:22.422
I was hoping our history
wouldn't be a problem.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.024
Jeremy, the only problem here

10:24.090 --> 10:26.960
is your complete
and total lack of consideration.

10:28.662 --> 10:31.364
You look really great,
have I told you that?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.868
You said the same thing
the day we got divorced.

10:34.935 --> 10:38.538
- Thank you for coming on short notice.
- Actually, it's good timing.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.608
I have meetings on the Hill
I've been putting off way too long.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.344
Not surprising.
My daughter says you're a rock star.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.880
Let's just say she's into politics.

10:46.947 --> 10:50.217
[chuckles] Well, hard not to be,
considering who her mother is.

10:50.283 --> 10:54.120
Christine, I asked you here
to get a feel for where you are

10:54.187 --> 10:56.289
in terms of passage of the ERA.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.059
I know the Florida Senate
is pretty evenly split,

10:59.125 --> 11:01.228
but you hold a considerable
amount of sway.

11:01.294 --> 11:06.766
Look, obviously, I support equal rights,
but I don't support unnecessary laws.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.269
Women participate now more than ever.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.738
Your presidency
is the best example of that.

11:11.805 --> 11:15.175
In other words, why not stop there?

11:15.242 --> 11:17.644
Why not be content with what we have,

11:17.711 --> 11:21.248
with what the Constitution implies,
rather than what it says?

11:21.314 --> 11:24.251
The 14th Amendment guarantees
equal rights to all persons.

11:24.317 --> 11:28.488
And it was passed in 1868, and women
weren't guaranteed the right to vote

11:28.555 --> 11:32.626
until 1920, when the
19th Amendment was passed.

11:32.692 --> 11:37.063
Christine, look, women still earn
74 cents on the dollar.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.467
Without a Constitutional foundation,
that's never gonna change.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.369
And that's a viable concern,

11:42.435 --> 11:44.971
but so is increasing the government,
in my opinion.

11:45.038 --> 11:49.175
Why'd we want to amend the Constitution
for something that's already in place?

11:49.242 --> 11:53.446
At this point, it's strictly symbolic.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.118
I see.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.054
Let's stay in touch
while you're in town.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.290
Of course.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.660
Ms. Chambers, Dickie McDonald.
Big fan. It's a pleasure to meet you.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.262
- Thank you. You, too.
- Dickie.

12:11.197 --> 12:14.167
The focus group of my Johns Hopkins
speech was interesting.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.568
Gave me some ideas.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.505
Always thought my memos
went straight into the burn bag.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.473
No. Sometimes I just shred them.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.644
OK, so what poll
are you going to show me?

12:24.711 --> 12:28.915
The ERA turns off the under 40s?
The over 60s? Golfers?

12:28.982 --> 12:32.819
Well, I'd like to show you a poll,
but I can't.

12:32.886 --> 12:36.656
Because there is no
national polling data on the ERA.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.825
Not within the last two decades.

12:38.892 --> 12:42.562
Look, ma'am, you've reached a point
in your presidency where

12:42.629 --> 12:46.633
the people finally see you as
the president, not a female president.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.169
- To remind them of it...
- Where's this going?

12:49.235 --> 12:51.171
[sighing] It's just not worth it.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.907
No Democrat, no Republican,

12:53.974 --> 12:57.077
no one wants to go near this
in an election year.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.514
Except me.

13:10.557 --> 13:14.094
When I was a girl,
it was a girl and her diary.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.496
Oh. Times have changed, I guess.

13:16.563 --> 13:20.000
In some ways.
And others not so much.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.337
I was wondering when you were
going to ask what I thought about this

13:24.404 --> 13:26.039
equal rights thing you're doing.

13:26.106 --> 13:29.576
OK, what do you think of this
whole equal rights thing I'm doing?

13:31.911 --> 13:35.515
Well, it seems like you're opening
the door for me to get drafted.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.517
That's what some people are saying.

13:37.584 --> 13:41.921
- Who's saying that?
- Well, the newspapers, the Internet.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.826
Well, that could happen.

13:46.893 --> 13:51.398
But the larger hope is that
the draft wouldn't... for either gender.

13:51.464 --> 13:54.601
But, Mom, there is a difference
between the sexes.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.371
I mean, yes, people should be
paid the same to do the same job,

13:58.438 --> 14:01.941
but otherwise, I think men should stay
men, and women should stay women.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.277
In other words, separate but equal?

14:04.344 --> 14:07.914
Becca, we've already figured out
that doesn't work.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.750
Not for race and not for gender either.

14:10.817 --> 14:13.686
- [chiming]
- Sorry.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.923
[Mac] You know what?
You should talk to Grandma about this.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.996
You know, Mom, maybe you're right.

14:23.063 --> 14:26.266
In fact, maybe I should go
to the town hall.

14:26.332 --> 14:30.937
You know, hear another point of view.
Cheer you on or whatever.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.909
That was a quick change of heart,
but I like it.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.213
- Thanks, sweetie.
- Yeah.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.686
[chiming]

14:46.753 --> 14:48.488
[exhaling deeply]

14:51.558 --> 14:55.128
The president has her position paper
and she'll respond when she reads it.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.496
OK, thanks.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.933
- Any update on the VP search?
- Why do you ask?

14:59.999 --> 15:02.001
Uh, because we don't have one.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.938
And because Colby's
chief of staff lives in my building.

15:05.004 --> 15:08.141
Bugs me every morning about it.
Can't really blame him, I guess.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.176
Colby thinks
he's got a shot at being VP.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.178
And you don't?

15:12.245 --> 15:15.648
Come on. A woman and a black guy?
One or the other, not both.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.818
Excuse me, Mr. Gardner.
General Allyson's here to see you.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.820
All right. I'll get out of your hair.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.156
[Dickie] Sir.

15:23.223 --> 15:27.193
- General, what can I do for you?
- Some material for you on the ERA.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.662
Since when are you
interested in social policy?

15:29.729 --> 15:33.366
Equality among the sexes means
women assigned to direct combat MOSs.

15:33.433 --> 15:37.270
What you've got there are letters from
previous Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs,

15:37.337 --> 15:40.807
policy papers, editorials.
They point to the potentially disastrous

15:40.874 --> 15:43.576
nature of something like this
on morale and readiness.

15:43.643 --> 15:46.312
I can show you as many papers
defending women in combat.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.014
And it shouldn't matter.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.850
Our job is to carry out
the president's agenda.

15:50.917 --> 15:54.187
Jim, the president
has my utmost respect.

15:54.254 --> 15:57.857
She's earned that.
But there's a culture in place here.

15:57.924 --> 16:01.127
What I'm afraid of is that
all the good work she's done

16:01.194 --> 16:03.396
would be undone by something like this.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.833
The military has got to be governed
by a different set of regulations.

16:08.234 --> 16:11.538
"This is one of the surest ways to
break down the morale of the Army

16:11.604 --> 16:15.475
and to destroy its efficiency."
The New York Times, 1948.

16:17.110 --> 16:20.346
Now, racial segregation
was complete ignorance.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.883
And who's to say we won't look back
in 50 years and say the same thing?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.688
I'll carry your concerns
to the president.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.758
Fair enough. That's all I can ask.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.092
Thanks very much.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.664
Good afternoon.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.832
I'd like to begin by
sharing some good news.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.535
The Illinois General Assembly
has scheduled a vote

16:42.602 --> 16:44.938
on the Equal Rights Amendment
later this week.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.005
[shouting]

16:46.072 --> 16:48.975
Is it true the president met with
Chambers to open up Florida

16:49.042 --> 16:51.544
- to another vote?
- The president is interested...

16:51.611 --> 16:54.447
- [man] What about Missouri?
- The president's interested

16:54.514 --> 16:57.684
in the status of the ERA in all
the states that haven't passed it.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.920
- Luis.
- [Luis] What's the reaction

17:00.987 --> 17:02.922
to the backlash that's against the ERA?

17:02.989 --> 17:05.090
[Kelly] I'd hardly call it a backlash.

17:05.157 --> 17:09.729
OK, we're talking about a handful
of demonstrations, nothing more.

17:09.796 --> 17:13.031
The president have a reaction to
the National Christian Council's

17:13.098 --> 17:15.902
suggestion that the ERA'll
destroy the American family?

17:15.969 --> 17:18.805
Is the president gonna continue
pushing a feminist agenda

17:18.871 --> 17:20.506
if she's elected to a second term?

17:20.573 --> 17:24.544
This is hardly solely a feminist agenda.
You guys, you're being...

17:24.611 --> 17:26.945
- [indistinct shouting]
- President Allen…

17:27.012 --> 17:29.682
We need someone to take this
and build a platform piece…

17:29.749 --> 17:32.352
Right this way.
Can I get you any coffee, Ms. Chambers?

17:32.418 --> 17:33.620
- Water?
- No, thank you.

17:33.686 --> 17:37.090
Hi, Ms. Chambers. Nathan Templeton.
My Chief of Staff, Jayne Murray.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.592
- Pleasure.
- Please, sit down over there.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.797
I understand you were summoned
to the Oval Office.

17:44.864 --> 17:48.768
- First time, was it?
- Yes, sir. It was.

17:48.835 --> 17:52.038
I suspect your political journey
is going to be a long one.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.474
- I like the way you work.
- Thank you.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.510
Drawing the president out,
letting her put herself out there

17:57.577 --> 18:00.647
on this ERA nonsense, then
voting it down in the Florida Senate?

18:00.713 --> 18:02.882
Well, I wish I could
take credit for that,

18:02.949 --> 18:07.987
- but that's not what I'm doing.
- Really? What is it that you're doing?

18:08.821 --> 18:10.790
I have a lot of respect
for the president.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.859
I'd like to hear what she has to say.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.396
- She's opened doors for women.
- She certainly has.

18:16.462 --> 18:20.500
A big door, to the most
important room on the planet.

18:20.566 --> 18:21.868
[Jayne] Which reminds me.

18:21.934 --> 18:26.205
As a young Republican,
which one of these do you respond to?

18:27.573 --> 18:30.476
Well, um...

18:30.543 --> 18:33.346
I guess the one on the right,
if I had to choose.

18:34.347 --> 18:37.216
We think alike.
That one's on our short list.

18:39.585 --> 18:42.488
The party needs your support,
Ms. Chambers.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.490
And the party gets it.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.559
But I am my own person, Mr. Speaker.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.562
[chuckles] That's for sure.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.468
Well, it was a great pleasure
to meet you.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.104
- And you.
- I want you to go by the Senate.

18:58.171 --> 19:03.843
I want you to say hello to two great
Floridians, Gil Olmstead and Lou Arkin.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.412
You don't have to worry about
getting in to see them.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.815
Just say I sent you.
They're old friends of mine.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.884
And mine. We're meeting later
for drinks at the Mayflower.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.986
You are?

19:14.053 --> 19:16.889
All right, well,
you say hi to them from me then.

19:16.956 --> 19:20.259
- I will. Have a nice day.
- And you, too.

19:23.096 --> 19:26.132
- What a piece of work she is.
- [Jayne chuckles]

19:27.900 --> 19:31.404
Can you believe the president's
getting traction on this thing?

19:31.471 --> 19:33.673
She's already
got a foothold in Illinois.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.142
And Florida.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.079
When am I doing
the Gordon Blake show?

19:40.146 --> 19:43.082
A week after the town hall. Why?

19:43.149 --> 19:47.653
Do you think that you could
get it moved before the town hall?

19:49.322 --> 19:52.358
[woman] We want
a woman vice president.

19:53.726 --> 19:54.761
It may not be...

19:54.827 --> 20:00.066
It was, in fact, too soon in 1972 to say
we could have a woman president,

20:00.133 --> 20:03.903
but it is not too soon to say
we could have a woman vice president.

20:03.970 --> 20:07.407
- [Jim] She was quite an orator.
- They all were.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.942
Alice Paul, Steinem, Friedan.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.812
And they changed the world.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.882
Please.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.518
Ma'am, I was approached
by General Allyson

20:18.584 --> 20:22.822
with concerns about the impact
of the ERA on our military.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.824
I've heard those arguments before.

20:26.192 --> 20:31.264
I think it's worth noting that the issue
of women in combat could backfire.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.468
Do you think I'm making
a mistake pursuing this?

20:37.336 --> 20:40.306
I think that you're passionate about it.

20:40.373 --> 20:44.010
I think you're right about it.
I think that it's an uphill battle,

20:44.076 --> 20:47.146
particularly given the fact
we're nearing the end of this term.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.548
True.

20:48.614 --> 20:51.117
That said, if this is something
that you want done,

20:51.184 --> 20:54.020
I'll do everything within my power
to make sure it happens.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.123
[sighs]

20:59.192 --> 21:01.027
Uh...

21:01.093 --> 21:03.129
Jim.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.398
It may not last...

21:05.465 --> 21:07.934
...my time in office.

21:10.436 --> 21:14.507
This may be our only chance.

21:29.755 --> 21:31.357
- Morning.
- Hey.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.992
What's going on with Illinois?

21:33.059 --> 21:35.495
Well, I'm bringing in
some key reps today.

21:35.561 --> 21:38.498
I hope they'll be able to go back
and influence their fellows.

21:38.564 --> 21:42.468
But the attack dogs
are certainly out in force.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.839
They call it spin now.

21:48.341 --> 21:51.344
I like what we used to call it...

21:51.410 --> 21:52.812
...lies.

21:54.514 --> 21:58.718
Do you remember when you took me
to see Gloria Steinem at the Civic?

21:58.784 --> 22:04.090
June 1974. I'll never forget it.

22:05.124 --> 22:09.762
You were so happy and buoyant
with the pins and the bumper stickers.

22:09.829 --> 22:14.667
- They kind of disappeared after that.
- It was hard to keep them on.

22:14.734 --> 22:18.871
Besides, I'd embarrassed
your father enough already.

22:18.938 --> 22:24.477
They called women who
supported the ERA men-haters.

22:25.545 --> 22:28.414
Truth is, we loved men.

22:28.481 --> 22:32.451
We just wanted them
to love us back equally.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.953
Hmm...

22:34.020 --> 22:36.789
So how long were you
and this Doughboy married?

22:36.856 --> 22:40.726
- It's Dobris. A little over a year.
- I can't believe you never told me.

22:40.793 --> 22:43.396
Divorce isn't exactly
something that you brag about.

22:43.462 --> 22:44.730
What happened?

22:44.797 --> 22:48.034
The Financial Times
offered him their Kyōto bureau.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.537
I was coming off the Chamberlain
campaign, getting lots of offers.

22:51.604 --> 22:54.407
He asked me to go to Japan.
I wanted to think about it.

22:54.473 --> 22:58.744
He didn't. Look, no one knows
about this, except you, OK?

22:58.811 --> 23:03.316
- So, I'd like to keep it that way.
- Of course. You want me to hate him?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.785
I will if you say so.

23:05.851 --> 23:08.588
Thank you for taking the time to see me,
Madam President,

23:08.654 --> 23:11.490
- given everything that's going on...
- Well, to be honest,

23:11.557 --> 23:13.793
- I've yet to experience a lull.
- Oh, no doubt.

23:13.859 --> 23:16.495
And for what it's worth,
I support the ERA.

23:16.562 --> 23:17.830
You already have the job.

23:17.897 --> 23:22.101
So how's this gonna work?
What is it you're gonna need from us?

23:22.168 --> 23:24.604
To start, I'd like to
interview you separately.

23:24.670 --> 23:27.139
Perhaps shadow you both
in your respective roles.

23:27.206 --> 23:31.377
To that end, I will need full access
to any events, travel, et cetera...

23:31.444 --> 23:35.648
Full access to everything I do
is not possible, but I'll do my best.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.016
Understood.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.185
When are we thinking
this'll go into print?

23:39.251 --> 23:43.189
My editor's given me a lot of latitude,
given your schedules.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.091
But we have to set a time limit.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.893
Can't have you wandering
the White House indefinitely.

23:47.960 --> 23:51.864
[Mac] Unfortunately, I'm on
a catch-as-catch-can basis,

23:51.931 --> 23:54.500
but I'll have you coordinate with Kelly.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.836
At your convenience,
Madam President.

23:56.902 --> 23:58.838
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:58.904 --> 24:01.007
- May as well get started.
- All right.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.277
Seems like a nice enough fellow.

24:05.911 --> 24:07.680
Excuse me.

24:08.681 --> 24:11.684
Look, you're never gonna
get married at this rate, my friend.

24:11.751 --> 24:14.053
I had a mother, Karen.
I don't need another one.

24:14.120 --> 24:18.124
[laughing] I mean it.
You gotta get out more.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.359
Greg and I haven't seen you for weeks.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.061
Probably not gonna happen soon.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.301
I may not take it,
may not be picked,

24:29.368 --> 24:33.239
but the president asked me
to think about being her VP.

24:34.874 --> 24:38.644
- Seriously?
- In some ways, it'd be a demotion.

24:38.711 --> 24:42.415
- I mean, chief of staff...
- The American public doesn't know that.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.217
As far as they're concerned,
the vice president is the

24:45.284 --> 24:47.420
second most powerful person
on the planet.

24:47.486 --> 24:51.357
- Not sure I'm all that interested.
- Bull. You wouldn't have mentioned it

24:51.424 --> 24:53.592
if you weren't thrilled by the prospect.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.563
Still, VP... I mean,
what are we talking about?

24:57.630 --> 25:00.399
Attending funerals,
glad-handing, politicking...

25:00.466 --> 25:02.468
All over the world. So what?

25:04.003 --> 25:07.339
Jim, you gotta do this.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.581
I'd be a target.

25:17.850 --> 25:21.587
Yeah, you would be.

25:22.755 --> 25:27.193
You'd be out there, exposed,
studied, commented on,

25:27.259 --> 25:30.596
getting threats, hate mail...

25:30.663 --> 25:34.967
...and you'd lift people higher

25:35.034 --> 25:37.436
than they'd ever been lifted before.

25:42.842 --> 25:46.011
[Mac] So, have you given any more
thought to what we discussed?

25:46.078 --> 25:50.750
To answer your real question,
no, I haven't changed my mind.

25:50.816 --> 25:54.153
You intend to block ERA legislation
in Florida's Senate.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.821
Yes, ma'am.

25:55.888 --> 25:59.525
I see. You know, I remember
hearing that you got

25:59.592 --> 26:01.927
your political science degree
from DePaul.

26:01.994 --> 26:04.864
- Go, Blue Demons, go.
- [chuckles]

26:04.930 --> 26:07.199
Pretty hefty tuition,
from what I understand.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.802
Well, I was there on a full scholarship.

26:09.869 --> 26:12.772
- That's right. For soccer, wasn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.940
- Fullback.
- Halfback.

26:15.007 --> 26:16.942
Ah, I see. Please.

26:17.009 --> 26:19.011
You know what's interesting about that?

26:19.078 --> 26:22.982
Before the passage
of Title IX in 1972,

26:23.048 --> 26:26.185
DePaul wouldn't have had
a women's sports program.

26:26.252 --> 26:29.522
And if it hadn't passed,
you might never have gotten that degree.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.932
Point taken.

26:47.540 --> 26:49.074
- Hey.
- Hey!

26:49.141 --> 26:52.444
How'd it go with Jeremy?
You spill the beans about me?

26:52.511 --> 26:55.481
I told him that you were
the love of my life and that you snored.

26:56.582 --> 26:58.150
So, how was your day?

26:58.217 --> 27:01.120
Depending who you ask,
I'm either destroying families

27:01.187 --> 27:03.522
- or making big government even bigger.
- Mmm.

27:03.589 --> 27:06.058
Rebecca thinks I'm destroying her life.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.394
Um, Dickie thinks I'm losing voters.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.996
The military is not on board, of course.

27:11.063 --> 27:14.567
God forbid we do anything
to upset them. "Don't ask, don't tell."

27:14.633 --> 27:18.571
- Don't do anything.
- Look, you're doing the right thing.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.907
You're not thinking
of walking this back, are you?

27:21.974 --> 27:24.243
You kidding?
I just got Christine Chambers

27:24.310 --> 27:26.979
to agree to call for an
emergency vote in Florida.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.081
Great! Great.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.951
You know, some political players
say she doesn't expect

27:32.017 --> 27:34.720
to win the ERA fight,
but even by losing,

27:34.787 --> 27:37.523
she guarantees herself
a majority of the women voters.

27:38.924 --> 27:44.830
- 1,460.
- I beg your pardon?

27:44.897 --> 27:49.468
That's the number of days
a president serves in a four-year term.

27:49.535 --> 27:54.673
For 1,460 days,
you're the leader of the free world.

27:54.740 --> 27:55.741
That's it.

27:55.808 --> 28:01.680
You got 1,460 days and she's
frittering away some of those days

28:01.747 --> 28:05.317
trying to push a bill she's pulled out
of the wastebasket of history.

28:05.918 --> 28:08.487
We're talking 1923, Gordon.

28:08.554 --> 28:11.156
She's trumpeting a suffragette's agenda

28:11.223 --> 28:13.459
because she doesn't have
an agenda of her own.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.995
Are you saying the president
has no real agenda?

28:16.061 --> 28:18.297
I'm afraid so.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.132
We're floundering, Gordon.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.635
This country can't be
allowed to flounder.

28:22.701 --> 28:26.272
We're the United States of America,
for heaven's sake.

28:26.338 --> 28:30.809
Sounds like words spoken by a man
who intends to run for president.

28:31.944 --> 28:34.747
[sighing]

28:34.813 --> 28:39.485
I probably should have
told my wife first, but...

28:41.453 --> 28:43.188
...yes, Gordon.

28:43.255 --> 28:48.027
I'm gonna run for president,
and God willing, I'll win,

28:48.093 --> 28:50.863
because this country needs me.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.936
[Kelly] I have calls
from every news outlet.

28:57.036 --> 29:00.172
Now that he's announced,
they're carrying the Mason event live.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.107
Senate majority leader pulled out.

29:02.174 --> 29:04.810
Didn't want to be an appendage
to the first debate.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.713
I saw a tape of his Blake interview.
Wanna know my reaction?

29:07.780 --> 29:09.181
- Who cares?
- Ma'am?

29:09.248 --> 29:11.784
Big deal. Templeton
is running for president.

29:11.850 --> 29:14.019
Tell me something
I haven't known for a year.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.055
We may have known,
but the public didn't.

29:16.121 --> 29:19.491
He waited until the morning of
the town hall so he could upstage you.

29:20.125 --> 29:23.028
Templeton can do all he wants
to try and grab the spotlight.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.830
But when we get on the stage tonight,

29:24.897 --> 29:27.132
I'm still the President
of the United States,

29:27.199 --> 29:30.202
and he's still just some guy
applying for my job.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.474
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:37.409 --> 29:38.844
Green tea, please.

29:38.911 --> 29:42.548
Oh. I didn't think you ever crossed
Constitution Avenue.

29:42.614 --> 29:48.120
Only when there's good reason to.
I'm glad to see you're still in town.

29:48.187 --> 29:51.156
I try to leave, but I keep getting
roped into more meetings.

29:51.223 --> 29:53.959
Everyone wants to
hitch a wagon to a rising star.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.195
You're a rocket, Christine.

29:56.261 --> 29:59.098
You've got the numbers,
the smarts, the people skills...

29:59.164 --> 30:02.901
Any of which these Beltway types'd give
their eyeteeth for. You have it all.

30:02.968 --> 30:06.372
With the right strategy, you can have
the governorship of Florida.

30:06.438 --> 30:09.708
This where you hand me your card
and tell me you can help me get there?

30:09.808 --> 30:12.311
This is where I tell you
how to get to the White House.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.546
I can't allow myself
to think that far ahead.

30:14.613 --> 30:18.317
Two terms in Tallahassee, it's
your next stop. It's a clear trajectory.

30:18.384 --> 30:23.555
Bad thing about trajectories, though,
one little misstep, one little bump,

30:23.622 --> 30:26.892
one divisive issue,
it can go a whole 'nother way.

30:28.727 --> 30:30.729
I thought you worked for the president.

30:30.796 --> 30:34.066
You align yourself with the ERA,
you lose northern Florida.

30:34.133 --> 30:35.868
You lose northern Florida,

30:35.934 --> 30:38.937
you lose the governorship
and your state Senate seat.

30:39.004 --> 30:43.776
End trajectory.
In my professional opinion.

30:44.710 --> 30:47.279
First consultation's free.

30:50.149 --> 30:52.818
[sirens blaring]

30:57.189 --> 31:00.359
[crowd applauds and cheers]

31:03.262 --> 31:06.265
- Are you up for this?
- Are you kidding? I love this.

31:06.331 --> 31:09.701
Ma'am, Chambers backed out.
Florida won't hold a vote.

31:09.768 --> 31:12.438
Not this year, anyway.
Looks like someone got to her.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.206
[Jim] The speaker got to Chambers?

31:14.273 --> 31:17.009
We'd love to take credit
for her flipping, but we can't.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.745
- [chuckling] Come on.
- No, the truth is, we tried.

31:19.812 --> 31:22.815
Christine Chambers is her own woman.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.884
[indistinct chatter]

31:27.119 --> 31:29.154
Don't be so obvious.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.924
I'm not looking for your boyfriend,
all right?

31:33.459 --> 31:35.761
Well, I won't cramp your style.

31:36.595 --> 31:39.331
Don't go too far. Your mom's
gonna be up in ten minutes,

31:39.398 --> 31:41.400
so you might want to
take your seat soon.

31:41.467 --> 31:43.302
OK. Thanks.

31:43.368 --> 31:46.972
- I hope your Mom likes big crowds.
- Oh, she's used to it by now.

31:47.039 --> 31:51.810
Yeah, so is my boss.
I work for Nathan Templeton.

31:51.877 --> 31:53.679
Oh. Oh, that's cool.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.615
- Yeah.
- Um, see ya.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.417
Yeah.

31:59.218 --> 32:01.553
[Blackberry rings]

32:07.392 --> 32:08.393
[keys clicking]

32:24.209 --> 32:26.011
Hey, again.

32:27.746 --> 32:31.150
Oh, my God. Katherine?

32:31.216 --> 32:32.851
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute.

32:32.918 --> 32:34.820
Katherine's a Republican. You're...

32:34.887 --> 32:38.023
I just used my middle name.
Everything else holds true.

32:43.662 --> 32:44.796
[exhaling deeply]

32:44.863 --> 32:46.965
- I'm proud of you.
- I love you.

32:53.906 --> 32:55.307
Next stop, Iowa?

32:55.374 --> 32:58.710
I'm looking forward to many
spirited debates with you on the trail.

32:58.777 --> 33:01.346
Mmm. Don't plan on seeing me
out there anytime soon.

33:02.147 --> 33:06.118
[chuckling] If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you weren't running.

33:06.185 --> 33:09.254
I'm not. Not in the way you are.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.758
For you, next year is about
campaigning to be president.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.893
I'm not going to campaign.

33:14.960 --> 33:18.997
For me, next year
is about being president.

33:19.064 --> 33:21.767
You know,
someone once told me

33:21.833 --> 33:24.770
that the only reason to want to be
president is for the power.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.706
And you know what? He was right.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.709
And that's what I have to do
for as long as I hold this office,

33:30.776 --> 33:32.411
exercise that power.

33:32.477 --> 33:34.046
[woman] Ladies and gentleman,

33:34.112 --> 33:37.049
please welcome the Speaker
of the House, Nathan Templeton.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.318
[audience applauds]

33:40.118 --> 33:44.022
Ma'am? Good news out of Illinois.
Just thought you would want to know.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.425
[woman] ...the President
of the United States.

33:46.491 --> 33:48.694
- [♪ Hail to the Chief]
- [audience applauds]

33:51.863 --> 33:54.333
[Templeton] I'm sure
every leader worth his salt

33:54.399 --> 33:59.571
would answer your question
with High Noon, but I'm a Bogart man.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.173
I have great admiration...

34:01.240 --> 34:03.976
More of an Ingrid Bergman man,
if you ask me.

34:04.042 --> 34:09.481
It's nuance that I love.
That's what Casablanca is chock-full of.

34:09.547 --> 34:14.686
I mean, just look at the moral
complexity of the characters.

34:15.219 --> 34:18.489
Nothing's all good, nothing's all evil.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.559
Redemption is everywhere.

34:20.626 --> 34:26.565
Forgiveness, understanding, and
ultimately, the attraction of opposites.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.802
You know, it's like Rick says
at the end of the movie,

34:30.869 --> 34:36.842
"Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship."

34:36.908 --> 34:38.677
[audience applauds]

34:42.581 --> 34:46.251
Mr. Speaker, I wonder if your
appreciation for that film has anything

34:46.318 --> 34:50.688
to do with the fact that "Casablanca"
translates to "White House"?

34:50.755 --> 34:52.724
[audience laughs, applauds]

34:55.761 --> 34:57.896
- Here's looking at you, kid.
- [Mac laughs]

34:57.963 --> 35:01.400
Mr. Templeton,
I was wondering what made you

35:01.466 --> 35:05.704
- declare your candidacy this morning?
- It was spontaneous.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.773
Remember Steve McQueen
in that movie,

35:07.839 --> 35:11.743
saying that he had this uncle
who used to, once a year,

35:11.810 --> 35:16.214
run buck naked out of the house
and jump into a cactus patch?

35:16.281 --> 35:18.550
The family would all
run out after him, yelling

35:18.617 --> 35:21.353
"Uncle! Uncle,
what did you do that for?"

35:21.420 --> 35:23.522
And every year
he'd give the same answer.

35:23.588 --> 35:27.559
He'd say "Seemed like
a good idea at the time."

35:27.626 --> 35:29.094
[audience chuckles]

35:29.161 --> 35:31.763
Well, it seemed like
a good idea at the time

35:31.830 --> 35:37.102
for me to tell the American people
that they had a choice.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.106
- Me.
- [audience applauds]

35:43.442 --> 35:45.110
[Templeton] Yes, ma'am?

35:45.177 --> 35:50.282
A lot has been made about the push
to pass the ERA. But isn't it obsolete?

35:50.349 --> 35:55.153
Well, I mean, that's really for you
to decide, ma'am, not me.

35:55.220 --> 36:00.425
But I think the lady to my right
is evidence that it is.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.060
[audience applauds]

36:03.261 --> 36:05.397
- [Mac] Uh, what is your name?
- Olivia.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.933
[Mac] Olivia, you ask a valid question.

36:07.999 --> 36:11.870
But the Equal Rights Amendment
is not for the first female president.

36:11.937 --> 36:15.574
It's for the girl who wants
equal opportunity in school.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.377
It's for the single mother
who can't get a mortgage

36:18.443 --> 36:20.078
or a small business loan.

36:20.145 --> 36:25.183
For the woman who faces harassment
in her office and violence in her home.

36:25.250 --> 36:30.789
The ERA isn't gonna solve all
of these problems, but it will help.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.491
Moments ago,

36:32.557 --> 36:37.329
the Illinois General Assembly
ratified the ERA.

36:37.396 --> 36:40.098
[audience applauds]

36:41.767 --> 36:45.704
The amendment has now
been ratified by 36 states.

36:49.040 --> 36:53.178
A lot of people think the ERA
was introduced in the 70s,

36:53.245 --> 36:57.649
but, in fact, Alice Paul first
wrote the amendment in 1923.

36:57.716 --> 37:01.787
Women had just won the right to vote,
and detractors told her,

37:01.853 --> 37:04.823
"Well, the battle for equality is over."

37:04.890 --> 37:06.892
But Alice Paul fought on.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.429
She liked to quote an adage that
she'd learned from her mother, a farmer.

37:10.495 --> 37:13.865
"When you put your hand to the plow,

37:13.932 --> 37:17.335
you can't put it down
until you get to the end of the row."

37:21.873 --> 37:26.645
And so, like Alice Paul
and so many others before her

37:26.711 --> 37:28.713
who have fought for equality,

37:28.780 --> 37:31.316
tonight, we take one step forward.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.251
And know this.

37:33.318 --> 37:38.290
We will fight on, and we will take
one more step, and then one more.

37:38.356 --> 37:40.759
Because there is
too much work left to do.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.395
There is too much unfinished business.

37:43.462 --> 37:47.232
We will keep our hands to the plow,
because I ask you...

37:47.299 --> 37:49.568
If not us, who?

37:49.634 --> 37:52.237
If not now, when?

38:13.091 --> 38:16.361
He met with her earlier today,
pushed her to kill the vote.

38:16.428 --> 38:20.165
- [Rod] Hey, hey, fantastic. Great.
- [Kelly] Congratulations, ma'am.

38:20.232 --> 38:22.601
- [man] Wonderful. Well done.
- Thanks, honey.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.569
Excuse me a second. Dickie.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.505
- Ma'am.
- Can I speak with you a minute?

38:26.571 --> 38:30.542
I took a quick, unscientific poll.
Overwhelmingly favorable.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.611
- Well done.
- I'm glad you think so.

38:34.846 --> 38:37.649
So, you met with Christine Chambers.

38:39.417 --> 38:43.121
And you somehow convinced her to block
the ERA vote in the Florida Senate.

38:43.188 --> 38:44.956
I was doing my job.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.926
Your job is to help me
fight for what I believe in.

38:47.993 --> 38:51.563
No. My job is to keep you in office.
To protect you.

38:51.630 --> 38:54.132
- From what?
- Yourself.

38:56.735 --> 39:00.605
Next year, I plan to limit any
contributions to my reelection fund

39:00.672 --> 39:02.807
to $100 per person.

39:04.376 --> 39:07.279
And any stumping I do,
I'm gonna do from the Rose Garden.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.215
I'm gonna campaign
by doing my job, Dickie.

39:10.282 --> 39:13.785
And if that isn't enough
to get me a second term, so be it.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.123
It's a nice thought, ma'am,
but that's not how things work.

39:18.189 --> 39:21.960
- Not in this town.
- Your services are no longer required.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.635
It was a town hall meeting,
not a debate.

39:30.702 --> 39:33.438
Oh. Well, I guess if you're
gonna call us the winner,

39:33.505 --> 39:35.807
I can live with debate.
Where's it gonna be?

39:35.874 --> 39:38.743
- Top story above the fold?
- You hate reporters, don't you?

39:38.810 --> 39:39.811
I gotta go.

39:40.845 --> 39:42.981
I bet you got
some good material tonight.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.049
Absolutely.

39:44.115 --> 39:46.518
I want to thank you
for helping me land this gig.

39:46.585 --> 39:49.654
I didn't really do anything,
but you're welcome.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.857
You did a lot by not having
the Secret Service kick me to the curb.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.859
The thought did cross my mind.

39:54.926 --> 39:58.396
- [woman] There you are.
- Oh, hey. I wanted you two to meet.

39:58.463 --> 40:00.498
Kelly Ludlow, this is my wife, Chikako.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.868
Hello. Nice to meet you. Yeah.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.606
I'm sure the president needs me.

40:07.672 --> 40:10.508
- It was nice to meet you, Chikako.
- You, too.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.444
- See you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

40:14.112 --> 40:17.882
Oh, Kelly, did you hear about Dickie?

40:17.949 --> 40:20.819
- Huh? What?
- The president fired him.

40:20.885 --> 40:22.187
[door opening]

40:22.654 --> 40:28.593
- [crowd applauds]
- Thank you. Thank you. Jim.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.865
- Do we have to do this press thing now?
- Uh, yes.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.768
Ma'am, this may not be
the best time for this,

40:36.835 --> 40:39.671
but the other day
when we were talking...

40:39.738 --> 40:43.408
- Yes.
- Well, I just wanted you to know

40:43.475 --> 40:47.846
that I would be proud and honored to
be considered for the vice-presidency.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.216
OK.

40:51.282 --> 40:55.787
FEC filing on Monday, interviews
with finance chairs on Tuesday,

40:55.854 --> 40:57.789
press secretaries on Wednesday…

40:57.856 --> 41:03.361
I haven't felt this invigorated since,
gosh, the first Congressional campaign.

41:03.428 --> 41:07.298
Can we still pay your staff
in Chinese takeout?

41:07.365 --> 41:10.402
I've got messages from
every state party chair.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.470
Governors from New Hampshire, Iowa,

41:12.537 --> 41:14.839
South Carolina,
all requesting appearances.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.741
First stop should be Florida.

41:16.808 --> 41:20.912
Childhood home, red, white
and blue bunting, full brass band.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.415
You're gonna want it
for your first campaign spot.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.951
Aren't you in the wrong room,
young man?

41:28.086 --> 41:29.254
Am I?

41:31.189 --> 41:34.125
- [indistinct chatter]
- All right. Thank you, everyone.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.393
Thank you for coming.

41:35.460 --> 41:39.497
- Madam President? You need to see this.
- What?

41:41.666 --> 41:46.137
[crowd chants indistinctly]

41:49.708 --> 41:52.711
[crowd cheering]
