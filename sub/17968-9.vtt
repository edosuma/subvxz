I'm sorry, sir.
- No...

09:44.313 --> 09:45.946
I'm not leaving without the coat.

09:45.981 --> 09:47.181
I'm keeping the coat.

09:47.216 --> 09:49.217
I'm keeping it. Yes, I am.

09:49.251 --> 09:51.486
Drop the coat, mother(bleep)!

09:51.520 --> 09:53.554
Drop the (bleep) coat!

09:53.588 --> 09:54.922
(Ilana) Oh, my God.

09:54.956 --> 09:56.690
(scoffing) The pistol doesn't shoot, honey.

09:56.725 --> 09:59.027
It's a 1782 Ketland flintlock.

09:59.061 --> 10:00.828
It's priceless 'cause
my father gave it to me,

10:00.862 --> 10:02.397
but it will not shoot.

10:02.431 --> 10:05.598
Okay, well, then I'm
gonna... I'm gonna smash this!

10:05.633 --> 10:06.733
No.

10:06.767 --> 10:08.135
- I will shove it through...
- Don't do that!

10:08.169 --> 10:10.337
- I will ruin it!
- Don't do that! Okay, okay, okay!

10:10.371 --> 10:11.804
Put it down.

10:11.839 --> 10:13.006
Get it.

10:21.182 --> 10:23.316
Jesus, who are you guys?

10:23.351 --> 10:26.219
Your worst nightmare.

10:31.659 --> 10:32.926
Okay, hey, dude.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.594
You don't need to go to Maureen's tonight.

10:34.628 --> 10:37.263
She was, she was full.

10:38.899 --> 10:41.034
She was hosting an orgy.

10:41.068 --> 10:42.902
- What?
- Okay. Sorry.

10:44.504 --> 10:46.105
(door slamming)

10:46.139 --> 10:47.574
I like orgies.

10:48.876 --> 10:51.477
Okay, so Adele is just about to meet us.

10:51.511 --> 10:53.579
I just want to let you know
that it's mostly sexual.

10:53.613 --> 10:55.247
She's not replacing you.

10:55.282 --> 10:56.982
I don't feel threatened... Thanks though.

10:57.016 --> 10:58.217
I'm just surprised.

10:58.251 --> 10:59.751
You never want me to
meet anybody you're with.

10:59.786 --> 11:01.820
The only reason I met Lincoln

11:01.854 --> 11:03.456
is because you forgot you
were with him one time.

11:03.490 --> 11:05.057
Oh, there she is.

11:05.092 --> 11:08.160
I don't know what it is about this girl.

11:08.195 --> 11:10.661
(Abbi) Um, I think I know what it is.

11:10.696 --> 11:12.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:12.164 --> 11:13.398
Hi.

11:25.010 --> 11:27.212
(both laughing breathlessly)

11:28.414 --> 11:29.880
Adele, this is Abbi.

11:29.915 --> 11:30.815
Abbi, Adele.

11:30.849 --> 11:31.782
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.250
So nice to finally meet you.

11:33.284 --> 11:35.185
I've heard so much about
you, seen so many photos.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.487
I feel like I already know you.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.388
Yeah, it's like... that's crazy.

11:38.423 --> 11:39.624
I feel like I know you too.

11:39.658 --> 11:41.058
Adele, it was so nice meeting you.

11:41.093 --> 11:44.695
Um, I gotta go see about a
girl and get her coat back.

11:46.598 --> 11:49.198
Dude, uh, she looks exactly like you.

11:49.233 --> 11:50.600
So.

11:51.836 --> 11:52.836
- See ya.
- (Adele) Bye.

12:00.077 --> 12:01.077
Ooh.

12:01.112 --> 12:02.112
Oh. (Both laughing)

12:10.487 --> 12:12.488
Um, I'm here to see Miss Ripa.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.689
Right this way.

12:13.724 --> 12:15.391
Okay.

12:15.425 --> 12:17.660
- (elevator dinging, doors rattling)
- Hi.

12:17.694 --> 12:20.530
I cannot believe you found my jacket.

12:20.564 --> 12:22.665
Thank you so much. Come on in.

12:22.699 --> 12:24.733
I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

12:24.767 --> 12:28.103
No, it was the perfect amount of troubles.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.638
So much fun.

12:29.672 --> 12:31.907
Whoa, Bed Bath and Beyond coupons.

12:31.941 --> 12:34.743
(both) Yeah, I practically live there.

12:34.777 --> 12:36.611
That's my favorite store.

12:36.646 --> 12:38.613
You want a drink?

12:38.648 --> 12:39.714
Yeah. I'd... Yeah.

12:39.749 --> 12:41.950
Mark had to take the kids to Telluride

12:41.984 --> 12:44.786
for a <i>capoeira</i> festival, so...

12:44.820 --> 12:47.070
I love <i>a cappella.</i>

12:47.085 --> 12:48.311
Hey, will you do me a favor?

12:48.354 --> 12:49.753
Can you take your shoes off?

12:49.788 --> 12:50.821
Um, sure.

12:50.856 --> 12:52.624
Put on a pair of those.

12:53.258 --> 12:55.659
We're a Shape-ups family.

12:58.663 --> 13:01.632
(seductive music playing)

13:06.971 --> 13:09.639
You a 28HH?

13:09.673 --> 13:12.175
Yeah, you got it.

13:12.210 --> 13:13.810
Weird. Me too.

13:16.580 --> 13:19.816
You know, Kelly, I gotta say,
your apartment is beautiful.

13:19.850 --> 13:21.718
Oh, thanks.

13:21.752 --> 13:23.019
It's rent controlled.

13:23.053 --> 13:26.122
I only pay 600 bucks a month.

13:26.156 --> 13:27.223
Really?

13:27.257 --> 13:28.558
Of course not!

13:28.592 --> 13:29.926
Prank!

13:29.960 --> 13:31.494
I love pranks!

13:31.529 --> 13:34.230
- Oh.
- Oh, my.

13:34.264 --> 13:36.432
I can't believe we finished
a whole bottle already.

13:36.466 --> 13:37.534
Oh.

13:37.568 --> 13:38.834
That's okay.

13:38.868 --> 13:41.904
I've been meaning to
crack open a special batch.

13:41.938 --> 13:43.338
Here you go.

13:43.372 --> 13:46.975
Whoa, what is that?

13:47.010 --> 13:49.811
Moonshine!

13:56.052 --> 13:57.085
Oh, my God.

13:57.119 --> 13:59.487
Do we have the same exact tattoo?

13:59.522 --> 14:01.757
No, that's <i>your</i> arm.

14:01.791 --> 14:02.958
Oh, right.

14:02.992 --> 14:04.526
Right, right, right. (Chuckling)

14:08.164 --> 14:10.831
(slurring) Strahan keeps
sending me all these gift baskets

14:10.866 --> 14:16.037
to butter me up because
he wants to switch sides

14:16.072 --> 14:20.608
and everybody knows, first of
all, that I sit camera left.

14:20.642 --> 14:21.976
Everyone knows that.

14:22.010 --> 14:23.978
<i>Everybody</i> knows.

14:24.012 --> 14:26.448
You know what I think
about sitting camera right?

14:26.482 --> 14:28.682
I'll show you... this...

14:28.716 --> 14:32.086
I'll show you what I think about
sitting camera right right now.

14:36.591 --> 14:38.758
- Ah ha!
- (Thudding)

14:38.793 --> 14:40.494
Oh, (bleep), dude!

14:40.528 --> 14:42.629
That's the street! Oh, (bleep)!

14:42.663 --> 14:43.930
I gotta take a whiz.

14:43.965 --> 14:45.799
And I'll tell you what, when I get back,

14:45.833 --> 14:49.035
I wanna see that big-ass
mother(bleep) basket

14:49.070 --> 14:51.704
down next to my little-ass
mother(bleep) basket.

14:51.738 --> 14:53.539
Are you kidding?

14:56.610 --> 14:59.078
(music continuing)

15:02.916 --> 15:04.117
Okay. (Clearing throat)

15:04.151 --> 15:06.952
Could we turn off the lights maybe?

15:06.987 --> 15:09.422
Oh, but I wanna see your cute little face.

15:09.456 --> 15:10.723
Cool.

15:10.757 --> 15:12.091
Uh, okay.

15:12.126 --> 15:13.759
One second.

15:14.794 --> 15:16.695
Okay.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.163
Um.

15:18.197 --> 15:19.665
Okay, that's better.

15:32.211 --> 15:34.246

15:43.388 --> 15:45.089

16:02.140 --> 16:05.242
It'll just give us trippier visuals.

16:05.277 --> 16:08.245

16:26.764 --> 16:28.999

No, the biting was dope.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.903
I just...

16:32.937 --> 16:35.205
It's too weird.

16:35.239 --> 16:37.007
- What's too weird?
- Okay.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.441
I wanna put this delicately

16:38.475 --> 16:40.677
'cause I don't want to
freak you out too much,

16:40.712 --> 16:45.481
but it came to my attention
that we look exactly alike.

16:47.785 --> 16:49.052
Yeah, no (bleep).

16:49.087 --> 16:50.320
You knew?

16:50.354 --> 16:52.388
I'm not blind, I mean,

16:52.423 --> 16:54.891
isn't that why you approached
me in the first place?

16:54.926 --> 16:56.193
No.

16:56.227 --> 16:58.393
I was drawn to your aura.

16:58.428 --> 17:00.730
And your scent, you know.

17:00.764 --> 17:03.966
And your curls and your cheeks.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.201
Of course I'm drawn to myself.

17:05.234 --> 17:06.702
I masturbate in the mirror!

17:06.737 --> 17:07.669
Me too!

17:07.704 --> 17:09.503
That's what's so hot about it.

17:09.539 --> 17:11.073
It's like hooking up with yourself.

17:11.108 --> 17:12.307
I know, but...

17:12.342 --> 17:16.444
I have sex with people
different from me, you know?

17:16.479 --> 17:20.249
Different colors, different
shapes, different sizes.

17:20.282 --> 17:22.184
People who are hotter, uglier.

17:22.219 --> 17:24.619
More smart, not more smart.

17:24.654 --> 17:26.155
Innies, outies.

17:26.189 --> 17:27.856
I don't know... a Catholic person.

17:27.890 --> 17:31.059
Nobody knows our bodies the way that we do.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.693
Look.

17:32.728 --> 17:34.295
Your G spot...

17:34.329 --> 17:37.498
- is right here.
- (Gasping)

17:37.532 --> 17:40.168
(sputtering)

17:40.202 --> 17:41.702
Too intense. Too intense.

17:41.737 --> 17:42.971
Oh, my God.

17:43.005 --> 17:44.572
I lost my vision.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.807
Yeah, for a second.

17:45.841 --> 17:47.275
I don't know though.

17:47.309 --> 17:48.276
I don't know.

17:48.310 --> 17:49.911
It's like, creepy to me.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.479
I'm sorry.

17:51.513 --> 17:53.648
That's lame, but yeah.

17:55.651 --> 17:57.318
Listen.

17:57.352 --> 17:59.287
We should still stay in touch

17:59.321 --> 18:01.221
for organ donation or jury duty.

18:01.256 --> 18:04.024
Mm-hmm.

18:04.058 --> 18:05.058
You want?

18:05.093 --> 18:06.293
Oh, no.

18:06.327 --> 18:08.495
I don't smoke pot.

18:13.501 --> 18:16.837
I gotta say, like, you're
much wilder than I...

18:16.871 --> 18:18.972
(air puffing)

18:19.007 --> 18:20.974
(both laughing drunkenly)

18:21.009 --> 18:23.043
You're, like, much wilder
than I thought you were.

18:23.077 --> 18:25.679
- Like, I didn't know.
- I know.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.146
(slurring) A lot of
people think that because

18:27.181 --> 18:29.849
I'm on the "Morning Show"

18:29.883 --> 18:33.453
that I have to be like,
America's good girl.

18:33.552 --> 18:34.619
Totally.

18:34.653 --> 18:37.422
And I'm just like, at this place in my life

18:37.456 --> 18:39.257
where I've accomplished a lot.

18:39.291 --> 18:40.458
So much, man.

18:40.493 --> 18:41.659
Yeah.

18:41.694 --> 18:44.362
I literally don't even give any (bleep).

18:44.397 --> 18:47.465
Like, I hate (bleep).

18:47.500 --> 18:49.233
They're the worst.

18:49.268 --> 18:50.835
Seriously, you have to pull me harder

18:50.870 --> 18:53.470
'cause I can't even get into
a full pretzel like this.

18:53.505 --> 18:54.571
What do you mean?

18:54.606 --> 18:55.906
What is a pretzel?

18:55.940 --> 18:58.542
- Why are we doing this?
- Stretch.

18:58.576 --> 19:00.243
I like it, but what is it?

19:00.278 --> 19:02.345
(elevator dings, door opens)

19:04.081 --> 19:06.383
(Kelly laughs drunkenly)

19:06.418 --> 19:07.984
Abbi.

19:08.019 --> 19:11.455
You get first pick. (Chuckling)

19:11.489 --> 19:14.357
First... ?

19:14.392 --> 19:16.526
I...

19:16.560 --> 19:21.898
I, like, haven't waxed my
body in a long time, you know?

19:21.933 --> 19:25.835
So like, I gotta, I gotta be going.

19:25.869 --> 19:27.938
- Thank you so much.
- No.

19:27.972 --> 19:29.105
For like, everything.

19:29.140 --> 19:31.274
- All the drugs and stuff.
- Abbi, no.

19:31.309 --> 19:33.910
- I have to.
- No, Abbi, no!

19:33.945 --> 19:35.211
Abbi! (Foot stomping)

19:35.246 --> 19:37.447
I ordered Domino's for after!

19:39.575 --> 19:42.275
You know, maybe I should
have (bleep) the prostitute.

19:42.276 --> 19:46.580
I mean, he was actually kind
of hot in like, a scary way.

19:46.615 --> 19:48.949
And I bet he doesn't even
care if I waxed or not.

19:48.984 --> 19:51.418
They don't care if you're waxed.

19:51.452 --> 19:54.755
Listen, if a prostitute's what you want,

19:54.789 --> 19:56.991
I can make that happen.

19:57.025 --> 19:58.859
Really?

19:58.894 --> 20:00.027
Yeah.

20:00.061 --> 20:00.961
That'd be insane.

20:00.996 --> 20:02.362
That'd be, like, so badass.

20:02.397 --> 20:04.096
I can make the call.

20:04.131 --> 20:07.634
They could get here in 25 minutes.

20:07.668 --> 20:09.002
For real?

20:09.036 --> 20:10.202
Yeah.

20:11.238 --> 20:12.338
Grab my phone.

20:12.372 --> 20:13.406
I'll do it.

20:17.645 --> 20:20.146
Here goes.

20:20.180 --> 20:21.380
We get to pick what they look like?

20:21.415 --> 20:22.582
We get to pick our names?

20:22.616 --> 20:25.685
Fuerta would be my name.

20:25.719 --> 20:26.853
Charlie.

20:26.887 --> 20:28.620
- Oof.
- As a girl.

20:28.655 --> 20:29.621
Ooh.

20:29.656 --> 20:31.990
All right, I'm gonna be spontaneous.

20:32.025 --> 20:33.325
Let's go. Go. Call.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.326
Okay, here we go.

20:34.361 --> 20:36.262
- Own up.
- I'm ready.

20:36.296 --> 20:39.065
Okay, I don't know any prostitutes.

20:39.099 --> 20:40.433
You're letting me make the call!

20:40.467 --> 20:42.734
I don't know! You were going with it!

20:42.769 --> 20:45.003
I just wanted to see what would happen!

20:45.038 --> 20:47.973
Kelly has really changed you.

20:48.807 --> 20:53.344
Do you know someone you
could call to make the call?
