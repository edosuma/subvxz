00:51.720 --> 00:53.260
Dina?

00:53.320 --> 00:55.639
Oh, hey. Sorry, I'm late.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.519
- No.
- Are you ready?

00:57.520 --> 00:58.821
Yes.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.199
How you feeling? Are you nervous?

01:10.200 --> 01:12.039
Stop.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.628
I've brought three casseroles,
and I put them in the fridge.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.519
Here.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.026
I can do this one.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.439
Okay, here's your purse.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.839
Your lunch is inside.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.519
Um, there's a...

02:34.520 --> 02:36.279
There's a ramp around
the side if...

02:36.280 --> 02:37.866
I'm fine.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.182
Let's go, let's go.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.559
Four minutes late, Mr. Marc.

02:48.560 --> 02:49.959
Did you bring a note?

02:51.120 --> 02:52.919
Stanhope, read aloud
where we left off.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.759
"Richard and I went across the
road to the stubbly field,

02:56.760 --> 03:00.639
"and I let him climb
in the tractor saddle,

03:00.640 --> 03:02.079
"and I showed him..."

03:02.080 --> 03:03.519
Stanhope, you're a sleeping pill.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.199
It's not me, it's...

03:05.200 --> 03:07.039
It is you. Of course it's you.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.399
You've already been
accepted at MIT,

03:08.400 --> 03:09.719
and you're wondering
why you should care.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.039
Why should Stanhope
care about John Updike?

03:12.040 --> 03:13.501
Who can answer this?

03:14.240 --> 03:15.679
Who are you droids?

03:15.680 --> 03:18.267
Where is my class that you've
kidnapped and replaced?

03:19.760 --> 03:22.108
He should care because
Updike wrote...

03:25.480 --> 03:26.906
"The lesson over,

03:28.080 --> 03:31.111
"he went to the garden patch
and joined his mother.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.391
"He punched her stomach,

03:35.280 --> 03:37.389
"and I watched them pretend to box.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.599
"Above them, on a
single strand of wire

03:41.600 --> 03:44.159
"strung to bring our
house electricity,

03:44.160 --> 03:50.502
"grackles and starlings neatly
punctuated an invisible sentence."

03:52.200 --> 03:54.150
You ever heard that before?

03:55.680 --> 03:58.347
Updike has handed you an image

03:59.000 --> 04:00.759
that was never described before.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.346
What do you think of his gift?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.347
Oh!

04:06.920 --> 04:08.426
Fine. You know?

04:09.480 --> 04:12.919
While I take a nap, your
assignment is to write

04:12.920 --> 04:14.759
a never-before created image,

04:14.760 --> 04:17.119
one that will shake me and
cause me to put your work

04:17.120 --> 04:18.639
in the next issue of
the <i>Croyden Lion.</i>

04:18.640 --> 04:20.279
Yes, Tammy?

04:20.279 --> 04:21.678
You haven't graded our
last three assignments,

04:21.680 --> 04:23.239
and I don't know where
I stand in this class,

04:23.240 --> 04:25.759
and I need an "A" because I'm
not accepted to Princeton yet,

04:25.760 --> 04:28.108
and they'll take this
quarter's grade into account.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.268
What a dull, plodding sentence.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.424
Of all the words you
had to choose from,

04:37.680 --> 04:40.267
all the possibilities
of rhythm and sequence,

04:40.440 --> 04:42.439
you gave me oatmeal

04:42.440 --> 04:44.788
when you could have served
me a New York steak.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.343
Just write the assignment
now, everyone.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.704
Just one sentence that
elevates humankind

04:54.240 --> 04:56.319
with one image fresh-baked
from the ovens

04:56.320 --> 05:01.467
of your computer-deadened,
shopping mall-suffocated minds.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.359
Shaftner, wake up!

05:07.640 --> 05:10.181
Write, you droids.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.861
Write.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.950
- Good morning, Jack.
- Will.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.746
You were late again.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.825
Car trouble.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.799
Who's the bastard
that turned me in?

05:22.800 --> 05:23.999
I am.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.799
Why are you always late this year?

05:25.800 --> 05:27.279
I don't know.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.759
Why are you always dressed
monochromatically?

05:32.080 --> 05:35.359
I guess I do tend toward
the look of a uniform.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.239
Past life maybe.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.639
You were an usher?

05:41.840 --> 05:43.199
Come and see me in my office,

05:43.200 --> 05:45.025
first period after lunch.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.351
What, because I was late?

05:48.400 --> 05:50.543
More. There's more.

05:54.760 --> 05:56.630
Antihistamine.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.749
Antihistamine.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.999
- Ellen?
- Not playing.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.119
Not playing.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.839
Walt? Antihistamine.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.199
Uh, bifurcation.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.519
Only four syllables. My point.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.679
Don't encourage him.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.159
Okay, bifurcational.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.110
I'll accept.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.559
So we're getting
three of them today,

06:19.560 --> 06:21.879
the teachers from that
failed Croyden school.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.239
Coextensively.

06:23.240 --> 06:24.839
We're getting art honors.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.839
Do you know who's
teaching art honors?

06:26.840 --> 06:28.999
- No.
- And what they call her?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.799
- Coextensively.
- Will you stop?

06:30.800 --> 06:33.079
Will you stop interrupting?
It's Walt's turn.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.951
Uh, diabolical, and I quit.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.719
Who is this?

06:37.720 --> 06:39.510
Dina Delsanto.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.239
She's a very successful painter.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.439
You couldn't afford to collect her.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.079
The only thing Walt
collects is lint.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.039
So what do they call her?

06:48.040 --> 06:49.239
The Icicle.

06:51.440 --> 06:53.359
They say she caned a student.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.039
She caned a kid?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.919
That's nonsense.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.559
They would have put her in prison.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.719
Well, let's check for a tattoo.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.239
Good morning.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.999
I would like to introduce
our new teachers...

07:04.000 --> 07:07.719
Miss Elliot, Latin, Mr. Chow, Math,

07:07.720 --> 07:09.919
and Miss Delsanto, Art Honors.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.439
Please make them feel welcome.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.479
Any questions, we'll defer to Walt,

07:13.480 --> 07:15.999
'cause he's been
teaching here since, uh,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.399
when was it, 1842?

07:18.400 --> 07:19.747
Two.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.559
This way. I will show
you to your classes.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.227
Miss Delsanto, make
yourself at home, please.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.351
Excuse me.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.061
Mr. Chow, I will see
you later today.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.639
Thank you.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.941
Hi.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.079
My name's Jack Marcus.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.950
Kids call me Mr. Marc.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.199
And now you say your name.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.159
Uh, we were introduced.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.224
Oh, I never listen
to the headmaster.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.906
So what do you teach?

07:55.880 --> 07:57.439
Art Honors.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.629
Hence the scarf.

08:00.760 --> 08:02.039
And you?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.341
Honors English.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.319
Hence the hence.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.264
Feel like a warm-up game?

08:11.880 --> 08:13.079
Uh, no.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.399
I say a five-syllable
word that starts with

08:15.400 --> 08:17.879
you say a five-syllable
word that starts with

08:17.880 --> 08:20.279
and we go on until
someone is stumped.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.265
Antihistamine.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.599
Antihistamine.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.471
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.784
All right, I'll allow that.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.558
Carolingian.

08:34.559 --> 08:37.399
Now, you can challenge my
word if you think it's wrong,

08:37.400 --> 08:41.546
but if you lose the challenge,
it's an extra point for me.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.143
Carolingian.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.319
<i>Divertimento.</i>

08:47.320 --> 08:48.679
Italian, not allowed.

08:48.680 --> 08:50.599
Oh, you didn't stipulate English.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.345
Of course the game's in English.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.799
Carolingian.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.309
Five English syllables, please.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.030
Dumb-dumber-dumbest.

09:04.680 --> 09:06.505
All right, I'll allow that.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.946
Examination. "F" to you.

09:10.720 --> 09:11.999
Fffff!

09:12.000 --> 09:14.780
This is the lounge, isn't it?

09:15.240 --> 09:18.623
Would you please
allow me to lounge?

09:19.200 --> 09:21.901
<i>Certamente, Signorina.</i>

09:22.280 --> 09:23.627
Thank you.

09:29.040 --> 09:30.580
There's just one thing.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.346
Did you really hit a
student with that cane?

09:38.480 --> 09:41.226
No. It was a teacher.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.261
Feasibility.

10:00.480 --> 10:02.599
Hey, don't. Just...

10:02.600 --> 10:04.390
Come on! Shh!

10:05.080 --> 10:06.159
Morning.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.541
Morning.

10:08.200 --> 10:09.599
Afternoon.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.839
Miss Delsanto, we'd hoped you'd
bring in some of your paintings.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.319
My favorites are the
ones that you did

10:14.320 --> 10:16.119
when you lived in, um, New York.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.759
Personally, I'm a fan of
your more figurative work.

10:18.760 --> 10:19.919
Swint!

10:19.920 --> 10:21.959
And we're so glad that you
chose our little town.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.039
I didn't choose.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.479
Well, but moving from New
York to the country, I...

10:27.480 --> 10:29.191
Family.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.599
So you want to know why I
moved out of the city, hmm?

10:35.600 --> 10:37.026
Interesting.

10:37.720 --> 10:43.559
And odd, because I have no curiosity
at all about your private lives.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.599
I don't need to get to know you.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.999
I don't need anyone's life story.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.189
We're not going to
become good friends,

10:50.920 --> 10:52.079
and I'm not the kind of teacher

10:52.080 --> 10:54.781
you're going to come back to
visit when you're all grown up,

10:55.120 --> 10:59.159
bringing a box of chocolates
and a Hallmark card.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.507
No.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.359
Whose work is this?

11:04.360 --> 11:07.439
Oh, uh, that's mine, Gloria Belser.

11:07.440 --> 11:08.866
This is skill.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.159
We all appreciate skill.

11:12.160 --> 11:17.399
The dictionary says "art
is human creative skill."

11:17.400 --> 11:20.679
So if you accept that definition,
this is art, correct?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.679
What's your definition, Miss?

11:22.680 --> 11:23.799
Correct?

11:23.800 --> 11:24.799
- Yes.
- Yes.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.479
Thank you. And this one?

11:26.480 --> 11:28.399
Uh, um... that's mine.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.670
This has skill, too,
and something else.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.319
I feel the presence of
something else here.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.667
I feel.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.070
Maybe that's the key.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.959
This one registers in my brain.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.599
This one registers in my
brain and in my chest,

11:45.600 --> 11:46.719
- or I could say...
- Chest.

11:46.720 --> 11:47.919
Stop.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.559
Heart, or I could say...

11:49.560 --> 11:50.719
Lower.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.869
Shut up.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.787
Emotion?

11:57.640 --> 12:00.239
Is that the key, emotion?

12:00.240 --> 12:02.110
Oh, be careful,

12:02.960 --> 12:06.039
'cause if your doggy just
died and you look at that,

12:06.040 --> 12:09.559
you might become very
emotional and call that art.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.479
But that's not the art
we're interested in.

12:11.480 --> 12:15.039
In this class, we're interested
in what we might call fine art.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.239
Fine art, whatever that means.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.079
The trouble is in the words.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.666
Don't trust the words.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.679
The words are lies.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.470
The words are traps.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.959
We're going to look,
we're going to feel,

12:28.960 --> 12:31.519
we're going to see,
we're going to learn,

12:31.520 --> 12:36.348
until you can show me what
fine art is, all right?

12:36.760 --> 12:38.519
You can start.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.239
Greetings, my Captain.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.239
Lieutenant Swint, all secure?

12:44.240 --> 12:45.479
Yes, sir.

12:45.480 --> 12:46.759
Any duties for me?

12:46.760 --> 12:48.879
Flood the moat, keep the
rabble from the gates.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.439
Hey, Mr. Marc?

12:50.440 --> 12:52.583
Why do you always eat
lunch in your car?

12:53.680 --> 12:55.079
So that for half an hour

12:55.080 --> 12:57.951
nobody can ask me
an inane question.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.829

the striking and the fire ♪

13:05.800 --> 13:08.944

13:38.920 --> 13:41.759
Oh, Mr. Marc, there are sixty
new girls in school today.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.479
One of them is going to
break your heart, Finetti.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.861
I hope so.

13:46.120 --> 13:49.039
You're going to turn an award-
winning magazine into a what?

13:49.040 --> 13:50.239
An online blog?

13:50.240 --> 13:51.959
They don't even give
those awards anymore.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.599
There hasn't been a lit
mag competition in years.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.559
They are too expensive,
and frankly I don't...

13:57.800 --> 13:59.022
Elspeth, um...

13:59.720 --> 14:02.599
Jack, you know Miss
Croyden from our board.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.319
Miss Croyden, yes.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.119
Imagine a low bow here.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.070
Will was just about to get frank.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.359
Yeah. Uh, Jack, we have
found the magazine

14:11.360 --> 14:12.759
to be disappointing lately,

14:12.760 --> 14:14.759
uninspired, I'm afraid.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.839
And, Jack, you started the
magazine with such a bang,

14:17.840 --> 14:19.039
with some of your own work.

14:19.040 --> 14:21.468
Your students were motivated.

14:21.760 --> 14:22.879
You were a published author.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.639
I'm still a published author.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.159
It doesn't go away like the mumps.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.319
- Six years...
- What the hell is this?

14:27.320 --> 14:28.519
Publish or perish? Are you kidding?

14:28.520 --> 14:30.026
This is friggin' high school.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.519
Who else has had anything
published here? You?

14:32.520 --> 14:34.079
You were our literary star.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.599
What difference does
my publishing make?

14:36.600 --> 14:37.799
It made a difference.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.839
It made it easier to
forgive your faults.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.319
Faults?

14:41.320 --> 14:43.119
You were banned from The Huntsman.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.679
Oh, for God's sake.

14:44.680 --> 14:45.879
A Croyden teacher banned

14:45.880 --> 14:47.159
from the town's oldest
and best restaurant?

14:47.160 --> 14:48.599
I had an argument with
that pompous maître-d.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.759
You were drinking, Jack.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.399
You have drinks with
dinner, for Christ's sake!

14:51.400 --> 14:52.999
Jack, you were drunk!

14:53.000 --> 14:54.279
We got the calls.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.159
You told us last year there
would be no more incidents.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.319
What the hell is going on here?

14:57.320 --> 14:58.519
You have surveillance on me

14:58.520 --> 15:00.310
in case I stumble
and fall on my ass?

15:00.480 --> 15:02.519
You know, the work in the magazine

15:02.520 --> 15:05.639
goes up and down according to the
talent of the current students,

15:05.640 --> 15:08.199
and the classes, the
honors classes, yes.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.999
Uninspired, yes.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.439
The whole friggin' school.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.399
You know, we're teaching
in the era of the undead.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.599
We're all trying to inspire.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.359
You know, I then have words
with some smug waiter,

15:17.360 --> 15:19.719
and suddenly, I'm
surrounded and stoned.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.319
You know, what else?
Who else has a complaint?

15:21.320 --> 15:24.351
Anybody else here got any
bad news for Jack Marcus?

15:24.680 --> 15:26.479
Hey! Come on out!

15:26.480 --> 15:28.066
Let's have it all!

15:35.360 --> 15:37.947
We're putting together
a really good issue,

15:39.720 --> 15:40.959
The <i>Lion.</i>

15:40.960 --> 15:43.359
You know, there's some
new work planned for it,

15:43.360 --> 15:44.661
my own work,

15:45.240 --> 15:46.985
beyond the essay that I do.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.786
There's a new poem.

15:55.680 --> 15:59.302
The magazine is important
to Croyden. It is.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.159
As for The Huntsman, that
was nothing, you know.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.428
I already apologized.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.101
It was nothing.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.346
What else?

16:16.040 --> 16:17.580
That's it, Jack.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.911
It's good news that
you're writing again.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.271
It really is.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.826
Elspeth.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.981
Is my job in jeopardy?

16:39.840 --> 16:41.320
You'll meet with the
board next month.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.959
Jesus Christ.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.625
What happened to you, Jack?

16:46.240 --> 16:50.599
You came here full of literary
awards and full of promise.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.359
You turned the classes
on their heads.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.027
Yeah, I remember.
I got laid a lot then.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.599
You going to punish me with that?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.399
- Do you know me that well?
- It was just one slip.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.839
Forget it. Elspeth,
I need this job.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.949
Then show us something.

17:04.839 --> 17:07.790
With your students' work,
with the magazine,

17:08.319 --> 17:09.519
with your new poem.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.151
Be who you were.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.310
Nobody can do that.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.707
Hello?

17:37.960 --> 17:39.466
Dina?

17:40.800 --> 17:43.639
Hey, why are you painting
in your pretty blouse?

17:43.640 --> 17:45.279
I'm retiring this blouse.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.519
I'm giving it to you.

17:46.520 --> 17:50.199
No, we'll just have it re-sewn with
a Velcro strip like the others.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.706
Do you want it or not?

17:53.320 --> 17:54.621
Here.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.146
At least put this on, huh?

18:01.240 --> 18:02.679
I can do it.

18:02.680 --> 18:03.981
Okay.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.183
So how was your first
day at Croyden Prep?

18:10.680 --> 18:14.029
Not one of them has any
fire in the belly.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.359
Well, there's one very gifted girl

18:16.360 --> 18:19.959
and an English teacher
who's a, pfft, madman.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.504
Barry sent these back?

18:27.360 --> 18:29.159
Oh, he doesn't understand them.

18:29.160 --> 18:33.079
He said that critics will
filet me if he shows them.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.399
Well, does he know about...

18:35.400 --> 18:36.679
What's the point?

18:36.680 --> 18:38.220
Sympathy?

18:41.640 --> 18:44.261
I know what it needs, but...

18:44.680 --> 18:45.719
You should rest.

18:45.720 --> 18:46.879
Mmm!

18:46.880 --> 18:48.909
Go home and feed your family.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.359
Mom wants a call.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.991
After I work.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.105
Thanks, Sabine.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.839
Ugh!

19:09.840 --> 19:11.471
Ow!

19:53.720 --> 19:57.422
In the beginning,
there was the word.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.544
And the word was

20:01.560 --> 20:03.199
indefatigability.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.879
That's eight.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.039
Eight?

20:06.040 --> 20:07.705
Eight.

20:11.480 --> 20:12.861
It's R.A., isn't it?

20:13.960 --> 20:15.199
You can tell.

20:15.200 --> 20:19.266
Well, my wife suffers
from it for years now.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.909
I noticed the...

20:23.600 --> 20:26.187
But she's doing much
better on the new drugs.

20:27.520 --> 20:31.188
So far my body hasn't found
a drug it can tolerate.

20:31.440 --> 20:35.586
The doctor says that he'll make me just
the right cocktail in time, but...

20:36.920 --> 20:38.359
interdenominational.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.119
Is he insane?

20:45.120 --> 20:46.319
Who?

20:46.320 --> 20:49.544
No, it means he likes you, Dina.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.107
God help you.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.239
- Antiegalitarianism.
- Oh, please.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.759
No, it's a ten. I've
been saving it.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.061
It's yours.

21:03.760 --> 21:07.759
Your generation has the most
agile thumbs in human history.

21:07.760 --> 21:08.999
Look at you.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.839
Twittering your friends in
no more than 140 characters

21:11.840 --> 21:13.039
and saying what?

21:13.040 --> 21:18.426
Showered, you watched some
shitty reality TV show,

21:18.640 --> 21:20.079
you ate a yogurt.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.667
You know, what if you had
to say something meaningful

21:23.000 --> 21:26.747
in just three lines and
about 17 syllables?

21:29.160 --> 21:30.319
"Morning and evening,

21:30.320 --> 21:32.861
"someone waits at Montsushima.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.039
One-way love."

21:37.040 --> 21:38.719
What is that about?

21:38.720 --> 21:40.879
That's about 400
years old, Freidman.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.399
It's a Haiku, an early Tweet.

21:43.400 --> 21:47.147
It tells us that somebody's
waiting, waiting all day,

21:48.080 --> 21:49.905
but no one is coming

21:51.840 --> 21:53.949
because this is

21:55.480 --> 21:56.639
a...?

21:56.640 --> 21:57.959
Uh...

21:57.960 --> 22:00.119
Oh, a one-way love?

22:03.120 --> 22:04.519
One-way love.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.919
Okay, okay, okay, pass
the assignments forward.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.439
All business today, sir.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.839
What was the assignment, Swint?

22:09.840 --> 22:11.839
Three paragraphs on the ant?

22:11.840 --> 22:13.279
Specifically?

22:13.280 --> 22:16.151
Three compelling
paragraphs on the ant.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.719
Specifically.

22:18.720 --> 22:21.519
Oh, we have to use the
actual encyclopedias,

22:21.520 --> 22:22.719
not the computers.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.990
Which is really archaic.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.279
Is it?

22:27.280 --> 22:29.628
Who can tell me who Baron Anson is?

22:30.600 --> 22:33.824
Baron Anson for an
immediate "A" grade.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.701
Come on.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.719
Come on, come on!

22:37.720 --> 22:40.079
He was a British naval commander.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.319
He sailed around the world.

22:41.320 --> 22:44.639
And he brought the first British warship
into China and started the Marines.

22:44.640 --> 22:47.199
Beautiful, just beautiful.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.919
Where is the town of Ansonia?

22:48.920 --> 22:51.279
Who the hell is Christopher Anstey?

22:51.280 --> 22:52.706
Swint, put your phone away.

22:53.760 --> 22:56.599
British poet. Had a
big hit in 1766.

22:56.600 --> 22:57.599
Huge.

22:57.600 --> 22:58.759
Bravo.

22:58.760 --> 23:01.599
You see, you use a computer,
you click on the word "ant,"

23:01.600 --> 23:03.279
you get the data. Fine.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.599
You pick up a book and leaf through
the pages to find the ant,

23:06.600 --> 23:09.719
you're going to bump into
a saint, an admiral,

23:09.720 --> 23:12.864
a poet, a town in Connecticut.

23:13.320 --> 23:16.199
You're going to learn something
outside of the assignment

23:16.200 --> 23:20.199
just because of your own undeniable
and most valuable curiosity.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.439
You're going to see a word,

23:21.440 --> 23:22.999
and you're going to jump on it,

23:23.000 --> 23:24.870
or it's going to jump on you.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.664
Then you have it forever.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.439
You know, Mr. Marc, I can type
in "ant" in the drop-down

23:31.440 --> 23:34.079
and get a whole bunch
of words like antonym,

23:34.080 --> 23:36.479
Antarctica, Antigua, uh...

23:36.480 --> 23:38.719
anthropology, and
even Anthony Hopkins.

23:38.720 --> 23:42.919
Anyway, Miss Delsanto
said words are lies.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.759
Yeah, they're traps, she says.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.391
Lies?

23:47.920 --> 23:49.301
Traps?

23:50.520 --> 23:51.901
She said that?

23:53.160 --> 23:55.986
What about truth, power?

23:56.640 --> 23:59.239
I think a pictures is a lot
more powerful than a word.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.746
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.065
How many think that?

24:07.160 --> 24:08.519
Don't you?

24:08.520 --> 24:10.106
No.

24:11.240 --> 24:12.541
No.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.119
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident

24:17.120 --> 24:19.229
"that all men are created equal."

24:19.920 --> 24:23.064
Self-evident, created equal.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.744
Shocking words in their time.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.791
Powerful.

24:29.080 --> 24:32.559
"And endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights."

24:32.560 --> 24:34.359
Unalienable.

24:34.360 --> 24:36.719
Unable to be given or taken away.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.146
What a word.

24:39.360 --> 24:43.199
"So that this nation shall
have a new birth of freedom

24:43.200 --> 24:44.799
"and that government of the people,

24:44.800 --> 24:49.389
"by the people, for the people
shall not perish from the earth."

24:50.520 --> 24:52.399
"And the sons of former slaves

24:52.400 --> 24:54.919
"and the sons of
former slave-owners

24:54.920 --> 24:58.542
"shall sit down together at
the table of brotherhood."

24:59.000 --> 25:00.347
Wow.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.439
What was that?

25:02.440 --> 25:04.359
Who did you hear in
that collage? Anyone?

25:04.360 --> 25:05.866
Jefferson?

25:06.160 --> 25:07.839
Lincoln.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.221
King.

25:09.880 --> 25:13.239
Words that began a
country, a whole country,

25:13.240 --> 25:14.999
then protected it in a time of war,

25:15.000 --> 25:17.621
and then dreamed it
better, made it better.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.781
Words did that,

25:20.240 --> 25:21.621
not pictures.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.587
Words.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.947
- Wow.
- This is war.

25:29.560 --> 25:30.999
War!

25:38.360 --> 25:41.709
So words are lies? Traps?

25:42.080 --> 25:43.959
Yes. Even mine.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.671
And pictures are?

25:46.120 --> 25:47.839
Do I have to actually say it?

25:47.840 --> 25:50.239
- Say it.
- All right.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.079
- A picture is worth...
- Don't you dare say that.

25:53.080 --> 25:56.199
- That is bullshit, and you know it.
- ...is worth a thousand words.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.679
Good-bye, I'm tired.

25:57.680 --> 26:00.759
You know, if words are lies,
then what's the truth?

26:00.760 --> 26:03.319
A picture? Something you painted?

26:03.320 --> 26:04.399
Here's a word for you.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.359
Arrogance.

26:06.360 --> 26:07.999
And here's a picture.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.519
Pfft!

26:10.520 --> 26:15.542
I am going to crush you.

27:03.280 --> 27:07.879
Hey, Dad, so we're at The Grill
just finishing up drinks.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.989
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.639
Hey.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.119
Are you still at The Grill?

27:14.120 --> 27:15.359
Yeah.

27:15.360 --> 27:16.879
I hope that you're still coming.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.919
Uh, I don't want to hold you up.

27:19.920 --> 27:21.790
No, no, it's fine.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.463
I really want you
to meet Catherine.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.279
God, we're beat.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.399
We did every hill in the county.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.959
They're all flat now.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.239
There you go, you see?
That's a good image.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.119
That's a damn good image.

27:36.120 --> 27:40.919
No, you flattened the hills by riding
over them like ironing wrinkles.

27:40.920 --> 27:44.639
No, that's good, Tony.

27:44.640 --> 27:45.839
Are... Are you writing?

27:45.840 --> 27:48.359
You haven't sent me any
of your writing for ages.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.866
You all right, Dad?

27:52.240 --> 27:54.542
They're trying to take
the magazine away,

27:55.440 --> 27:57.105
fucking bastards.

27:57.840 --> 28:00.188
You know, they're downsizing.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.347
So...

28:04.040 --> 28:05.639
So you're there with your girl?

28:05.640 --> 28:07.119
Yeah, with Catherine.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.319
Yeah?

28:08.320 --> 28:09.479
You wearing your funny clothes?

28:09.480 --> 28:11.039
Yeah, yeah.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.627
Why can't you people
wear normal clothes?

28:14.360 --> 28:17.439
You know, I mean, wear
the helmet, fine,

28:17.440 --> 28:20.159
but drop the weird clothing
unless you're actually racing.

28:20.160 --> 28:24.239
I mean, what if all car drivers
dressed like NASCAR racers?

28:24.240 --> 28:27.719
Be fucking silly, you know?

28:29.120 --> 28:30.999
But you guys, you know?

28:31.000 --> 28:34.319
You guys...

28:34.320 --> 28:35.781
You know what?

28:36.400 --> 28:37.861
I'm going to come.

28:38.360 --> 28:41.239
I'll be like 20 minutes,
and we'll have dessert.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.399
Dessert's on Dad.

28:42.400 --> 28:43.986
No, Dad, don't.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.639
Another time, okay?

28:45.640 --> 28:47.119
What? Why?

28:47.120 --> 28:48.945
Because you shouldn't drive, right?

28:50.520 --> 28:51.679
Yeah.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.027
Well...

28:54.600 --> 28:57.559
Well, you want to come
here and stop by?

28:57.560 --> 28:58.879
I can meet her.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.261
No.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.999
Okay, thanks, but, you
know, we're beat,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.428
so another time.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.309
You be well, all right?

29:10.440 --> 29:11.639
You be well.

29:23.480 --> 29:24.861
Sorry, guys.

29:26.280 --> 29:28.582
- Is your dad coming?
- No.

29:32.440 --> 29:33.759
He'll get you.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.748
Princess, get in.

29:38.240 --> 29:40.349
Come on, I'll drive
you to the door.

29:41.440 --> 29:42.919
Leave her alone, Swint.

29:42.920 --> 29:45.079
I can't. I'm sorry, I wish I could.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.799
I honestly wish I
could, but I can't.

29:46.800 --> 29:48.399
I think it's that geisha walk.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.639
Just keep walking.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.799
Your friend Emily here is
such an exotic beauty,

29:52.800 --> 29:54.519
which is very rare to these parts.

29:54.520 --> 29:56.279
- Come on, I'll drive you right to your desk.
- Come on, come on.

29:56.280 --> 29:58.239
You dare me? Huh?

29:58.240 --> 29:59.759
You dare me? Come on, Emily.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.439
You are my Madame Butterfly.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.599
Come fly with me.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.028
Swint! What are you up to?

30:06.600 --> 30:07.999
You know what, I'm
sorry, Mr. Cowan.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.359
It's the hunt.
You know, it's eternal.

30:10.360 --> 30:12.839
Park your car in the
street and get to class.

30:14.680 --> 30:18.109
Okay, stop for a moment and hold
up your work so I can see it.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.704
Are you satisfied?

30:24.080 --> 30:25.950
Is that good enough?

30:26.200 --> 30:29.159
Doesn't anybody want
to change the world?

30:29.160 --> 30:30.319
Too late.

30:31.640 --> 30:34.279
Ah, so then you strive to be what?

30:34.280 --> 30:35.439
Complacent?

30:35.440 --> 30:36.787
Not in this class.

30:38.120 --> 30:42.839
Cole, if violent fantasy is
as far as you want to go,

30:42.840 --> 30:44.439
at least make it your own.

30:44.440 --> 30:45.866
I've seen that before.

30:46.600 --> 30:49.879
Emily, start over,
correct the proportion.

30:49.880 --> 30:51.039
Start over?

30:51.040 --> 30:52.199
Yes, look at the neck.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.679
You can elongate the neck,

30:53.680 --> 30:55.119
but you still have to
have some balance.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.279
Hey, Emily, Emily.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.999
- Study Modigliani.
- Shh!

30:58.000 --> 30:59.159
- It's good.
- Shut up.

30:59.160 --> 31:01.119
- Swint?
- Miss?

31:01.120 --> 31:05.425
Do you think a cartoon cliché will
get you through my art honors?

31:05.720 --> 31:06.999
It won't.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.439
Okay, go back to work.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.071
Come on.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.439
All right, Miss, I'll change it,

31:13.440 --> 31:15.390
but...

31:16.320 --> 31:20.319
Calling this a cliché
is kind of ironic,

31:20.320 --> 31:23.464
because Mr. Marc said
that you teach cliches.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.639
We weren't supposed
to say anything.

31:26.640 --> 31:29.420
Mr. Marc's declared war on you,

31:30.440 --> 31:32.039
so what are you going to do?

31:32.040 --> 31:35.025
I don't know or care what
you're talking about.

31:35.880 --> 31:38.039
Keep your focus on
improving your work.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.468
Okay.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.799
Imagine this is the best drawing

31:42.800 --> 31:45.399
of a human brain you
have ever seen.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.101
Now listen.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.145
Listen.

31:51.000 --> 31:55.510
"The brain's fundamental secret
will be laid open one day.

31:56.760 --> 32:01.145
"But even when it has,
the wonder will remain

32:02.160 --> 32:04.349
"that mere wet stuff

32:04.800 --> 32:08.821
"can make this bright
inward cinema of thought,

32:09.760 --> 32:13.109
"of sight and sound and touch.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.264
"Could it ever be explained

32:18.480 --> 32:20.623
"how matter becomes conscious?"

32:21.280 --> 32:22.879
Not a thousand words.

32:22.880 --> 32:27.822
Only roughly 50 by Ian McEwan
in his novel <i>Saturday.</i>

32:28.440 --> 32:30.959
Now, are you telling
me that this picture

32:30.960 --> 32:33.159
is worth more than these words?

32:33.160 --> 32:34.759
Are you kidding?

32:34.760 --> 32:36.599
Doesn't that cliché piss you off?

32:36.600 --> 32:39.799
You are students of honors English,

32:39.800 --> 32:41.919
students of a language,

32:41.920 --> 32:43.719
students of a literature.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.943
Words are your gods,

32:46.360 --> 32:48.822
and somebody is insulting
your religion.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.704
And we're going to prove her wrong.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.519
Now.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.199
Hey, come and look at this!

32:57.200 --> 32:59.079
This is crazy!

32:59.080 --> 33:00.666
Mr. Marc!

33:01.560 --> 33:03.669
Marc's got his stuff out.

33:23.880 --> 33:25.879
Wow.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.830
It's better than I thought.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.582
We're not going to just lay
down for this, are we?

33:35.040 --> 33:36.944
Aren't you in honors English?

33:37.680 --> 33:41.462
Yeah, but it shouldn't be
all one-sided, you know?

33:43.600 --> 33:45.199
Hey, Tony, it's me.

33:45.200 --> 33:48.599
Listen, I'm really sorry
about last week, you know.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.824
I was so tired,
I could hardly talk,

33:54.320 --> 33:56.668
but I really want
to meet Catherine.

33:57.120 --> 34:01.220
So let's arrange it, you
know, Friday, whenever.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.263
Okay? So give me a call.

34:05.920 --> 34:08.029
Hey, Kristen! Wait up, guys.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.879
What do you have in the afternoon?

35:26.560 --> 35:28.271
She got you, Mr. Marc.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.559
Check that out.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.225
You can't draw that well.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.759
Yeah, that does look like you.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.061
Uh-oh!

35:39.640 --> 35:41.544
<i>Brava, Signorina.</i>

35:44.160 --> 35:45.871
You throw a good punch.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.101
I'm rocked.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.190
My knees are wobbly.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.101
I'm cut.

35:52.600 --> 35:55.665
Beyond the boxing imagery, um,

35:55.920 --> 35:57.551
is there a point?

35:58.360 --> 36:00.867
Oh, I get it. You're being aloof.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.679
No, that's fine. We need loofs.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.319
Do you know where the
word "aloof" comes from?

36:06.320 --> 36:07.839
- No.
- Dutch.

36:07.840 --> 36:12.065
Sailing into the wind,
like a big ship.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.199
You know what I have here?

36:14.200 --> 36:16.679
I have a preview of
the coming issue

36:16.680 --> 36:19.639
of the <i>Croyden Lion</i> just for you.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.669
Read it and weep.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.462
The next punch is mine.

36:24.960 --> 36:29.265
Oh, and here's a seven.
Internationality.

36:31.440 --> 36:34.266
Sorry? I didn't hear your response?

36:35.040 --> 36:37.959
Antiegalitarianism.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.479
It's a ten.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.384
You had that ready.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.239
Would you mind sailing off now?

36:45.400 --> 36:46.599
You had that ready.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.710
- Come on.
- You've been studying.

37:12.840 --> 37:17.623
The title is "Who Are
You?" by Jack Marcus.

37:21.000 --> 37:26.181
"I am a small poem on a
page with room for another.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.507
"Share with me this white field,

37:29.960 --> 37:32.627
"wide as an acre of snow,

37:33.160 --> 37:38.910
"clear but for these tiny
markings like the steps of birds.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.662
"Come now.

37:43.280 --> 37:46.359
"This is the trough of the wave,

37:46.360 --> 37:48.549
"the seconds after lightning.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.583
"Thin slice of silence
as music ends,

37:53.320 --> 37:56.021
"the freeze before melting.

37:56.640 --> 37:59.341
"Lie down beside me.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.039
"Make angels.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.239
"Make devils.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.622
"Make who you are."

38:08.800 --> 38:11.919
So you see? This poem is an
invitation to the reader...

38:11.920 --> 38:13.999
To lie down in the snow.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.599
To reveal himself or herself,

38:16.600 --> 38:17.759
and that's what you'll do,

38:17.760 --> 38:20.639
not with words, but with
a drawing or a painting

38:20.640 --> 38:22.199
that shows us what you feel,

38:22.200 --> 38:25.868
what you see as you
read this poem, okay?

38:32.400 --> 38:34.509
Ooh! Sorry, Mr. Marc!

38:39.360 --> 38:41.599
All right. Bring it.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.279
Tackle him, guys.

38:45.280 --> 38:46.627
Get him!

38:49.000 --> 38:50.825
Dribble all the way!

38:54.200 --> 38:55.831
Nice one!

38:57.920 --> 38:59.460
He's holding!

39:03.600 --> 39:06.079
Come on, Mr. Marc, get up!

39:06.080 --> 39:07.359
Get up, old man!

39:07.360 --> 39:08.719
He's really cute.

39:08.720 --> 39:09.919
I mean, like, look at him.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.799
We love you, Mr. Marc!

39:44.400 --> 39:46.031
Ah!

40:01.840 --> 40:04.079
Hey, Roy, you know where
"mayonnaise" comes from?

40:04.080 --> 40:05.519
The word.

40:05.520 --> 40:09.439
The French army, after
conquering the city of Mahón,

40:09.440 --> 40:12.759
had their cook create a new
sauce in honor of the victory.

40:12.760 --> 40:14.559
Mahón-aise.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.879
By the way, you got
some on your lip.

40:16.880 --> 40:21.479
And, Ellen, the word avocado
is actually an Aztec word.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.639
Mm.

40:22.640 --> 40:24.101
It means testicle.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.745
True story.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.823
Are you having another war?

40:30.560 --> 40:32.999
He's, uh, Iago.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.711
He's after my job,

40:35.040 --> 40:36.999
and she's his Lady Macbeth,

40:37.000 --> 40:40.429
and I know I'm mixing up my
Shakespeare, but I'm tired.

40:43.480 --> 40:45.305
You actually spoke to me.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.149
I want to talk to you
about your magazine.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.679
I'm having my students draw
their reactions to your poem,

40:51.680 --> 40:53.519
and some are already finished.

40:53.520 --> 40:55.119
The work is very good.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.199
And is the poem good?

40:57.200 --> 40:58.719
Yes.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.351
And did you draw one?

41:03.000 --> 41:04.999
I'm talking about my class.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.189
You did one, too, didn't you?

41:10.160 --> 41:13.782
I want you to include the three
best works in your magazine.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.439
No.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.759
You'll have to put them
in the art magazine.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.159
There is no art magazine.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.839
Exactly.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.399
Why not include artwork?

41:23.400 --> 41:24.999
Because a poem doesn't
need a picture.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.559
If you could capture a
poem with a picture,

41:26.560 --> 41:28.225
there'd be no need for the poem.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.999
Need? Oh.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.159
Need.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.999
You're being awfully
precious about the poem.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.479
Do we need your poetry?

41:35.480 --> 41:40.024
All we need is food and
shelter and air and sex.

41:40.480 --> 41:42.039
The rest is optional.

41:42.040 --> 41:43.439
Words are optional.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.319
Yes, but you're using
them now, aren't you?

41:45.320 --> 41:47.959
Because you need to communicate.

41:47.960 --> 41:51.439
Even the most basic cave
societies needed to communicate.

41:51.440 --> 41:54.439
Yes, hence the cave paintings.

41:54.440 --> 41:56.663
Paintings before the words.

41:57.160 --> 41:58.319
And you know where you can put

41:58.320 --> 42:01.544
your stuffy, drab,
pictureless magazine.

42:02.640 --> 42:05.999
And the round goes to Delsanto!

42:06.000 --> 42:07.519
- Delsanto?
- Ding, ding, ding.

42:07.520 --> 42:09.759
What are you talking about?
She left the ring.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.959
She quit.

42:10.960 --> 42:12.359
It was hit and run.

42:12.360 --> 42:13.741
Mm-hmm.

42:15.640 --> 42:18.341
All right, all right,
I have a challenge for you.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.306
Look, forget the poem.

42:21.320 --> 42:24.919
You pick a subject, paint a
picture, we print it in the issue.

42:24.920 --> 42:27.479
I write a thousand words
on the same subject.

42:27.480 --> 42:29.079
We have an assembly.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.999
Words versus pictures,
which is worth more?

42:32.000 --> 42:33.239
Why should I bother?

42:33.240 --> 42:34.439
This is your inane war.

42:34.440 --> 42:38.199
Because then I will print the
best of your students' work.

42:38.200 --> 42:39.399
You can choose them.

42:39.400 --> 42:40.599
Come on.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.902
It'll give them
something to shoot for.

42:43.280 --> 42:46.199
This inane war is
energizing these kids.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.661
No, I'm not painting.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.439
I will choose the best
work of my students,

42:51.440 --> 42:53.839
and you write your
thousand words off that.

42:53.840 --> 42:54.999
No, it's not allowed.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.711
I want you, Delsanto.

42:57.080 --> 42:59.679
You're always sailing
off against the wind.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.141
Shh.

43:01.680 --> 43:02.679
I like that.

43:02.680 --> 43:03.799
Come on.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.759
Then, Shaftner, let me
know you're hungry.

43:13.440 --> 43:15.959
Finetti, let Tammy know
you're attracted to her.

43:19.880 --> 43:21.864
Tammy, let him know
you don't want him.

43:24.360 --> 43:28.159
Okay, Stanhope, tell us you want to
gather the tribe together at noon.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.679
You want to talk
about making arrows

43:29.680 --> 43:32.142
and finding a better
place to dig for roots.

43:35.320 --> 43:38.279
See, grunting is fine,
but it only goes so far,

43:38.280 --> 43:40.799
and so are gestures
and cave paintings.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.070
And so people out of
necessity invented

43:45.760 --> 43:47.300
words,

43:48.440 --> 43:49.946
one by one,

43:50.720 --> 43:52.351
then codified them

43:53.280 --> 43:55.399
by usage, by mutual agreement,

43:55.400 --> 43:58.159
tribe by tribe, nation by nation.

43:58.160 --> 44:03.148
We went from "root,"
"dig," "fire," "arrow,"

44:04.320 --> 44:06.065
to "multitask,"

44:06.760 --> 44:08.141
"irreverence,"

44:08.720 --> 44:11.159
and what is supposedly the
most beautiful-sounding phrase

44:11.160 --> 44:14.111
in the English language,
"cellar door."

44:14.920 --> 44:18.941
You see, your language is
a living, growing thing

44:19.440 --> 44:23.319
that sheds old words and
absorbs new ones every day.

44:23.320 --> 44:26.199
And that's what I want
you to do, each of you,

44:26.200 --> 44:28.199
invent a new word.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.959
Tell us what it means,
where it comes from,

44:30.960 --> 44:34.519
and why you think it might stay and
live in the language for a while.

44:34.520 --> 44:36.239
The ten best new words

44:36.240 --> 44:38.479
will appear in the
coming issue of the Lion

44:38.480 --> 44:42.341
and just maybe spread from there
into usage around the school.

44:43.040 --> 44:44.239
Then the country,

44:44.240 --> 44:46.110
then who knows?

44:47.320 --> 44:49.861
The entire world.

44:50.440 --> 44:51.599
Is this for Marc's?

44:51.600 --> 44:53.079
Oh, would you look at that?

44:53.080 --> 44:54.479
I'm going to faint.

44:54.480 --> 44:55.639
Give it up.

44:55.640 --> 44:57.079
What? Give up Dim Sum?

44:57.080 --> 44:58.199
He's so disgusting.

44:58.200 --> 44:59.239
Why should I, man?

44:59.240 --> 45:00.519
She's the one I want.

45:00.520 --> 45:02.159
I really feel bad for you.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.359
Lots of guys want her.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.159
You know, I bet you want her, too.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.349
- Yeah.
- Hey.

45:07.880 --> 45:10.639
Hey, why ignore me, Princess,

45:10.640 --> 45:13.719
when I could show you
a very good time?

45:13.720 --> 45:15.999
Yeah? You showed Carol
Garson a good time,

45:16.000 --> 45:17.599
and then you bragged it
all over the school.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.664
Give me a break. She bragged, too.

45:20.640 --> 45:22.239
Why won't you give me a
break, Your Highness?

45:22.240 --> 45:23.746
Leave me alone!

45:24.760 --> 45:28.759
Oh, my Princess, why?

45:28.760 --> 45:30.983
Because you're slimy
and you're mean!

45:32.200 --> 45:34.199
- Ohh!
- Rejected.

45:38.520 --> 45:39.919
What are you laughing at?

45:39.920 --> 45:41.119
BOY 2; on, hey!

45:41.120 --> 45:42.239
Hey, get up!

45:42.240 --> 45:43.399
What the hell are you doing?

45:43.400 --> 45:45.359
Nothing, man! I just touched
the little shit's shoulder!

45:45.360 --> 45:46.559
Yeah, like that?

45:46.560 --> 45:48.146
Go, Cole!

46:39.400 --> 46:40.559
Sabine?

46:40.560 --> 46:41.999
Hello?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.223
I can't undress.

46:44.840 --> 46:47.519
The flare is killing me.

46:47.520 --> 46:48.679
Okay, Dina?

46:48.680 --> 46:50.719
Dina, I'm going to
come over right now.

46:50.720 --> 46:52.719
Take some ibuprofen, okay?

46:52.720 --> 46:54.279
Yes, thank you.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.919
Thanks for seeing me.

47:04.920 --> 47:09.305
I just wanted to apologize face
to face for what happened.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.639
I was having some personal
problems that night.

47:11.640 --> 47:13.101
It won't happen again.

47:14.240 --> 47:17.719
People want to feel safe and
relaxed in here, Mr. Marcus.

47:17.720 --> 47:19.919
It's... it's a haven.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.199
It is.

47:21.200 --> 47:22.706
It is a haven, I know.

47:23.520 --> 47:25.919
I swear an oath, Mr. Franks,

47:25.920 --> 47:27.959
may God strike me not
necessarily dead,

47:27.960 --> 47:29.919
but seriously injured if I fail.

47:29.920 --> 47:33.463
No, no, I really am serious.

47:39.120 --> 47:40.479
Very well.

47:40.480 --> 47:41.639
Thank you.

47:41.640 --> 47:43.639
Hey, you're early.

47:43.640 --> 47:44.999
Good boy.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.279
Hey, have you seen Delsanto's work?

47:47.280 --> 47:49.469
Yeah, yeah, I looked her up, too.

47:50.160 --> 47:51.999
It's incredible.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.159
Yeah.

47:53.160 --> 47:55.279
Why the hell doesn't she
just stay at home and paint?

47:56.440 --> 47:58.519
You think that cane is
from a football injury?

47:58.520 --> 48:01.107
She has rheumatoid arthritis.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.679
You know, there was
a time when my Edie

48:03.680 --> 48:05.744
couldn't even brush her teeth.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.759
Good morning. Good poem, Jack.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.399
Oh, so you saw it?

48:09.400 --> 48:12.079
Yes, honors art class made
copies, and I saw one.

48:12.080 --> 48:13.799
I'm eager for the
magazine to come out.

48:13.800 --> 48:14.999
Yeah, but it's not
coming out for weeks,

48:15.000 --> 48:16.839
and I've got my review coming up,

48:16.840 --> 48:19.199
so you'll tell them?

48:19.200 --> 48:21.239
Certainly, I will show
them the poem, but...

48:21.240 --> 48:22.701
But what?

48:23.480 --> 48:25.066
What are my chances?

48:25.560 --> 48:27.191
Looking better.

48:28.520 --> 48:31.359
Some of your colleagues
will be interviewed.

48:31.360 --> 48:32.519
We will see.

48:32.520 --> 48:34.639
You know I'm back in good
graces at The Huntsman.

48:34.640 --> 48:35.839
Good.

48:35.840 --> 48:37.505
And the work in my class,

48:38.480 --> 48:40.350
you should see some of the essays.

48:41.480 --> 48:43.145
Bring me the essays.

48:47.520 --> 48:50.300
Hey, you all right?

48:51.000 --> 48:53.679
I mean, you were out
for a while, so...

48:53.680 --> 48:55.479
So you missed me?

48:55.480 --> 48:59.341
And yet you greet me so
antienthusiastically.

49:01.160 --> 49:03.839
That's a nine.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.301
Nine.

49:09.080 --> 49:11.303
Welcome back, Delsanto.

49:12.120 --> 49:13.785
That's not your best.

49:14.120 --> 49:16.024
- It is my best.
- It's not.

49:16.560 --> 49:17.959
I can judge that better than you,

49:17.960 --> 49:20.911
and I can show you what
to do and how to do it.

49:21.360 --> 49:23.839
But every time I'm trying
to do what you say,

49:23.840 --> 49:25.359
it's never good enough for you.

49:25.360 --> 49:27.119
It shouldn't be good
enough for you.

49:27.120 --> 49:28.279
But I like it.

49:28.280 --> 49:30.230
I'm proud of this,

49:30.600 --> 49:32.679
and I'd like to finish it,
and you don't let me.

49:32.680 --> 49:35.759
You will finish it, and it
will appear in the magazine.

49:35.760 --> 49:37.799
In the <i>Croyden Lion</i>, next issue.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.599
Mr. Marcus will write
an essay on it.

49:39.600 --> 49:41.550
Not now!

49:41.840 --> 49:43.199
What?

49:43.200 --> 49:44.719
What if I don't want that?

49:44.720 --> 49:46.519
How could you not want that?

49:46.520 --> 49:48.470
Because it's a part
of the war, isn't it?

49:49.040 --> 49:51.079
The picture worth a thousand words,
I thought you were painting that.

49:51.080 --> 49:52.639
No, it'll be your painting.

49:52.640 --> 49:54.399
This painting.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.359
But I want to feel you.

49:56.360 --> 49:57.759
I want to see you.

49:57.760 --> 50:00.599
I don't want everyone looking at
it like it's a part of the war,

50:00.600 --> 50:01.839
like it's a part of that.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.879
What's the difference why
they're looking at it?

50:03.880 --> 50:06.159
Because they're going to...
I don't want...

50:06.160 --> 50:07.759
You don't want what? What?

50:07.760 --> 50:08.919
What?!

50:08.920 --> 50:10.359
I don't want everyone
looking at me!

50:10.360 --> 50:12.879
Oh, for God's sake,
Emily, to hell with them.

50:12.880 --> 50:14.719
I can't say that! You can!

50:14.720 --> 50:16.839
- I'm not like you.
- No, say it right now.

50:16.840 --> 50:18.279
To hell with them. Go ahead.

50:18.280 --> 50:20.519
Hear yourself say it.
To hell with them.

50:20.520 --> 50:22.759
Say it because they don't matter!

50:22.760 --> 50:25.039
They don't. None of them!

50:25.040 --> 50:26.199
The work matters!

50:26.200 --> 50:29.519
It matters to get the work
right and to get it right now,

50:29.520 --> 50:31.119
and that's all that matters,

50:31.120 --> 50:32.359
because that's what lasts,

50:32.360 --> 50:34.199
and you think you have
all the time you need

50:34.200 --> 50:36.879
to learn and grow and create?

50:36.880 --> 50:38.319
You think you have all that time?

50:38.320 --> 50:40.079
You don't! Nobody does!

50:40.080 --> 50:41.461
Nobody!

50:42.400 --> 50:45.988
If I do, if I paint
it for the magazine,

50:46.560 --> 50:49.919
can you please, please tell
Dale Swint to leave me alone?

50:49.920 --> 50:51.639
Oh, to hell with Swint.

50:51.640 --> 50:52.999
I'm telling you what's important.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.159
I'm telling you.

50:54.160 --> 50:56.986
I have something to give
you, something of value,

50:57.240 --> 50:59.359
and it's not the coaching
of your love life.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.719
It's not all... Come on!

51:00.720 --> 51:02.639
Emily, don't!

51:03.960 --> 51:06.024
Ahh!

51:22.880 --> 51:24.039
Hello?

51:24.040 --> 51:25.944
Sabine?

51:28.920 --> 51:30.439
Hello?

51:30.440 --> 51:31.946
Delsanto, it's me.

51:33.640 --> 51:34.799
I've been wondering,

51:34.800 --> 51:38.786
a man is worth more than
his words, isn't he?

51:39.760 --> 51:42.586
And a woman more than her pictures?

51:44.480 --> 51:46.479
Maybe we're less than that.

51:46.480 --> 51:51.079
Maybe our work is the best of us.

51:51.080 --> 51:52.586
I hope not.

51:53.320 --> 51:55.519
But there it is.

51:55.520 --> 51:57.479
You're hard, Delsanto.

51:57.480 --> 51:58.941
Am I?

52:00.200 --> 52:01.831
Are you?

52:04.760 --> 52:06.107
Is it...

52:07.160 --> 52:08.905
too late for a visit?

52:13.040 --> 52:16.071
Uh, yes, it's too late.

52:16.520 --> 52:18.060
Okay.

52:18.520 --> 52:20.948
I'll make other plans.

52:21.960 --> 52:24.199
Do you have other plans?

52:24.200 --> 52:26.104
Uh, yes,

52:27.200 --> 52:28.626
other plans.

52:29.720 --> 52:31.704
Good night then, Delsanto.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.061
Good night.

Ugh! It's Swint.

55:01.120 --> 55:02.279
Let me see.

55:02.280 --> 55:03.519
Oh, my God.

55:03.520 --> 55:05.424
"Date me or else?"

55:07.960 --> 55:09.119
Else.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.984
- Good one.
- Yeah.

55:16.120 --> 55:17.759
There she is.

55:17.760 --> 55:19.439
Yeah, there she is!

55:19.440 --> 55:21.265
What's going on?

55:22.400 --> 55:24.439
So, Emily, who knows you that well?

55:24.440 --> 55:26.759
Did you pose for this?

55:26.760 --> 55:28.079
Em. Shut up.

55:28.080 --> 55:30.039
Em, I'm so sorry. It's everywhere.

55:30.040 --> 55:32.359
It's all over the net.
Nobody knows who did it.

55:32.360 --> 55:34.439
Stop laughing!
Go to your classrooms!

55:34.440 --> 55:36.359
Go now! Go!

55:36.360 --> 55:37.639
I'm sorry.

55:37.640 --> 55:39.279
We removed it from the website,

55:39.280 --> 55:41.239
and I think we have
the boy who did it.

55:41.240 --> 55:43.199
Look at me when I
am talking to you!

55:43.200 --> 55:46.119
Do not... I said look at me!

55:46.120 --> 55:48.639
I have to make this phone
call now to you parents.

55:48.640 --> 55:50.639
Emily! Emily.

55:50.640 --> 55:51.941
It wasn't me.

55:52.840 --> 55:54.239
It wasn't me, Emily.

55:54.240 --> 55:55.826
It was Swint!

55:56.280 --> 55:57.439
It was Swint!

55:57.440 --> 55:59.185
Let's go in the office.

56:04.240 --> 56:05.639
They're after me, my Captain.

56:05.640 --> 56:07.590
I think they want to hang me.

56:08.120 --> 56:09.399
He says he didn't do it.

56:09.400 --> 56:10.559
Of course he did.

56:10.560 --> 56:12.159
And that you would vouch for him.

56:12.160 --> 56:13.639
I like Emily, sir.

56:13.640 --> 56:17.990
I tease her, but that's
because I like her,

56:18.120 --> 56:20.999
and that picture,
that's not my style.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.959
I can't draw that
graphic novel stuff.

56:22.960 --> 56:24.159
Miss, you know that.

56:24.160 --> 56:27.942
He's a smart ass, but I've
never seen him be malicious.

56:28.400 --> 56:29.919
This has to be killing Emily.

56:29.920 --> 56:31.079
I'm a cartoonist.

56:31.080 --> 56:33.951
Everyone knows that.
I'm a cartoonist.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.461
Wait outside.

56:48.120 --> 56:50.199
Emily says she is
sure it's Swint's,

56:50.200 --> 56:51.706
but she has no proof.

56:52.080 --> 56:53.559
This is Swint's book,

56:53.560 --> 56:55.439
and these two, they look the same.

56:55.440 --> 56:57.119
No, they're not.

56:57.120 --> 56:58.990
Cole has very short strokes.

56:59.960 --> 57:01.546
Look at all the shading.

57:01.720 --> 57:04.199
There's no shading at all in
this picture of Emily, none.

57:04.200 --> 57:07.679
I don't think that either of these
boys would want to hurt Emily.

57:07.680 --> 57:10.599
Oh, well, you don't
know Swint very well,

57:10.600 --> 57:12.359
and you don't know art at all,

57:12.360 --> 57:13.559
and I'm happy to give you a lesson.

57:13.560 --> 57:16.839
I don't need a lesson in
understanding my students.

57:16.840 --> 57:18.999
You're accusing Swint
because you don't like him.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.359
And you like him why?

57:20.360 --> 57:21.799
Because he calls you "my Captain"?

57:21.800 --> 57:23.239
- It's from a poem.
- Yes, I know.

57:23.240 --> 57:25.799
The Whitman poem, "O, Captain!
My Captain! Our fearful..."

57:25.800 --> 57:28.599
The military talk is just
some silliness between us.

57:28.600 --> 57:30.599
He's a clown, but he's smart.

57:30.600 --> 57:31.799
He's harmless.

57:31.800 --> 57:33.199
How sure of that are you?

57:33.200 --> 57:34.919
At least as sure as you.

57:34.920 --> 57:37.826
Miss Delsanto, this
is very serious.

57:38.160 --> 57:40.349
Criminal charges could be made.

57:41.080 --> 57:43.860
I have to suspend Cole
while we look into this.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.347
Oh.

57:47.520 --> 57:48.867
I see.

57:49.440 --> 57:50.866
Yes.

57:51.640 --> 57:53.180
Well, then, um...

57:54.680 --> 57:56.470
I better get out of your way.

57:56.680 --> 57:59.759
You're going to be very busy
suspending Cole Patterson

57:59.760 --> 58:02.399
and looking for a
replacement teacher

58:02.400 --> 58:05.465
for your art honors class
all on the same day.

58:06.480 --> 58:07.679
Miss Delsanto?

58:07.680 --> 58:09.759
Miss Delsanto!

58:12.520 --> 58:15.027
I'd hold back on that suspension.

58:16.480 --> 58:18.145
She's resolute.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.587
It's from the Latin resolutus.

58:22.400 --> 58:25.079
She has resolved.

58:25.080 --> 58:27.781
So why would Swint
want to hurt Emily?

58:28.720 --> 58:30.159
Because she refused him.

58:30.160 --> 58:31.599
So? We males are used to that.

58:31.600 --> 58:32.759
You know, we accept it.

58:32.760 --> 58:34.266
We eat it for breakfast.

58:34.880 --> 58:38.079
And by the way, would you have
breakfast with me this weekend?

58:38.080 --> 58:39.519
Sunday brunch?

58:39.520 --> 58:41.868
Brunch is a benign invitation.

58:42.880 --> 58:44.639
No. Thank you.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.430
See what I mean?

58:46.880 --> 58:48.959
My point.

58:48.960 --> 58:50.759
Is everything a game to you?

58:50.760 --> 58:53.347
Hardly anything.

58:55.160 --> 58:58.759
Someone struck out at a
fellow student today,

58:58.760 --> 59:02.189
and it concerns this class
because they used art

59:03.560 --> 59:04.919
as the weapon.

59:04.920 --> 59:07.679
We're going to fight back
with the same weapon,

59:07.680 --> 59:10.479
but we're not interested
in naming this attacker,

59:10.480 --> 59:14.182
but in defining what sort
of person would do this.

59:15.360 --> 59:18.439
So I want you all to think
of someone you've met

59:18.440 --> 59:20.159
who is like this and draw them.

59:20.160 --> 59:21.439
Wonder who that could be?

59:21.440 --> 59:22.639
He's a shit.

59:22.640 --> 59:24.519
Could be a she. Could be a teacher.

59:24.520 --> 59:29.189
This person enjoys
someone else's pain,

59:30.560 --> 59:32.589
someone else's fear,

59:33.560 --> 59:35.862
someone else's humiliation.

59:37.000 --> 59:40.839
You've seen this person smile or
even laugh when someone's hurt,

59:40.840 --> 59:42.119
especially when they've
done the hurting.

59:42.120 --> 59:43.626
They enjoy it.

59:44.880 --> 59:48.150
So draw as close a
likeness as you can.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.679
Hey, Dad.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.639
We have to cancel
Friday. I'm sorry.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.919
School has been crazy,

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.879
and Catherine is
assistant-teaching,

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.199
and we just have no time.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.119
But, you know, we'll figure
it out when things calm down

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.388
and make sure we get
together, okay?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.239
Captain.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.359
Lieutenant Swint. How you doing?

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.479
As well as can be expected, sir.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.079
You sure? Because I
know what it feels like

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.199
to be surrounded and outnumbered,

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.799
people sitting in judgment.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.359
I know, sir.

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.991
It's shit, sir!

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.919
What do I do, sir?

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.519
You stand tall, soldier.

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.039
Yes, sir.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.547
What are you doing? You
can't just take my book!

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.519
You can't just physically take
something from a student, okay?

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.310
There are rules!

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.239
You're not allowed to do this!

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.999
Ow! Sir, you're hurting a student!

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.950
So are you.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.959
This is stealing!

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.479
I'm going to charge
you for stealing.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.799
Confiscation, four syllables,
from the Latin <i>confiscare</i>...

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.559
to appropriate for the treasury.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.824
We now have evidence that Dale
Swint drew the Emily picture.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.719
You were right, I was wrong.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.351
What a surprise.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.919
It's from Swint's sketch book.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.079
Jack confiscated it.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.719
- You did?
- I did.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.239
And, well, it's of you,

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.429
so I'm not sure if
you want to see it.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.439
Fry the son of a bitch.

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.902
He will be expelled immediately.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.759
Doesn't mean the war is over.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.319
Last week, Emily used
words against Swint.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.679
Today Swint drew a picture.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.919
Look what happened.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:59.079
I'm still counting on your
painting for the magazine,

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:00.519
my thousand words,

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:02.479
and then we'll see who wins.

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:05.959
What's it really all about,
this artificial war?

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.386
You?

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.821
Yes.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:11.100
Me.

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.105
They want to fire me.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.039
I'm sure they'll interview you.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.104
I'm being reviewed.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:30.949
Can you think of one good
thing to say about me?

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.349
I'm at a loss for words.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:32.551
So that's a very exc...

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.826
Um...

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:37.669
Your Grace.

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.999
I'm not sure this
is a very good idea

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.039
for you to be here on
the eve of your review.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:44.119
You know, I thought about
that and I said to myself,

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.279
"Jack," which is
what I call myself.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.399
"Jack," I said, "it's
time to show the colors

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.239
"and let the community
know you are now accepted

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:56.479
"at the sacred Huntsman and in
charge of all your faculties."

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.879
Then Jack reminded me
that it's you, Elspeth,

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.706
who are in charge of all
the faculties around here.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:05.868
So you would know
what my chances are.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.506
What are they?

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.710
There's quite a bit against you.

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.506
I can't lie.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:16.439
But in your favor is the poem

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.639
and the fact that
you're writing again.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:19.101
I don't want to talk
about the poem.

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.079
You know, what... what
about the student essays?

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.959
What about the school-wide
interest in our debate,

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.830
Words Versus Pictures?

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.959
That proves the value
of the magazine.

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.399
The magazine is an economic issue.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.941
As for your place at Croyden
Prep, I don't know.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.679
I need a promise from you.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.119
I promise. I'll sign it in blood.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.319
What is it?

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.985
I need to know that if the...

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.185
if the decision goes against you,

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.188
you won't punish me for it.

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.519
You're still worried that
I'll spill our old secret?

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.504
I would just like your word on it.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.949
I do think you're a good man.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:05:59.821
No.

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.027
I'm not.

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.639
But I am a good teacher,

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.102
and I'll fight for that
with any means I have.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.710
And why should I promise you?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.319
Maybe if I keep you in fear,

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.588
you'll say some good
things about me tomorrow.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.319
Hey, Tom, give me the usual.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.667
You got it, Jack.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.226
Make it on the weak side.

01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.999
Ready?

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.839
Three, two, one.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.585
Oh!

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.239
I'm sorry, sorry.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.479
That's okay.

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.759
Ladies, these are on Jack.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:10.959
Thanks, Jack.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:13.079
You know he's a real writer.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.439
What do you write?

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:17.599
Oh, short stories, you
know, some poetry.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.345
And he's published, too, right?

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.279
You know I've been in the, uh...

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.359
the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, and...

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.759
What he doesn't know
though is I was, uh...

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.519
I was in <i>Playboy,</i> too.

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:31.759
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.359
What?

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.707
What?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.159
I was.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.559
I was Miss January.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.159
You want to see what I looked like?

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.639
Whoa! Whoa! Gently!

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.079
Sorry, sorry.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.381
That's okay.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.740
You have to leave.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.439
What, you out of vodka?

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.180
I want you out of here.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:01.581
Jesus. Nothing serious.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:08.142
Ladies, Tom.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.199
What'd I do? I fell off my chair.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.839
It's not about the chair.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.666
You're not funny,
you're not charming.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.319
You have a drinking problem.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.078
It's not a problem.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.506
It's a hobby.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.759
You know, some people
collect wooden ducks.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.106
Call somebody.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.265
Get a ride home.

01:08:47.319 --> 01:08:48.826
You all right?

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.479
- Okay, good night.
- Hey, what are you doing?

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:54.589
Come in for Christ sakes.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.303
You don't have to just turn
right around and go back.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.984
You want some coffee?

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:03.118
You want me to make it or...

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.910
No, I got it. Sit down.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.359
It's bullshit, you know?

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:13.519
The manager at the Huntsman's
just got it in for me.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.359
You know, I'm sorry to
drag you away from Cathy.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:18.071
It's Catherine.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:19.959
Jesus.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.625
What does she call you, Anthony?

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:27.589
By the way, what do you call Bill?

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:30.919
Do you call him Dad, too?

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.158
I call him Bill.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.319
Does he drink?

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:34.319
Does ever get drunk,

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:38.305
or am I the only one in your
world that likes a drink?

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.345
Why is my poem on your board?

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.660
Because it's good.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.146
It's your best.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.159
When are you going to get your car?

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.781
I'll just take a cab
in the morning.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.821
You know, uh...

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.263
they're trying to
fire me, so, uh...

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:13.239
desperate measures are called for.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.519
What are you going to do?

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.199
Everything. I'm going
to use everything.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.319
Good luck.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.951
Everyone.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.399
'Cause I'm a good teacher,

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.239
and that's worth saving, isn't it?

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.399
I don't really want any coffee,
and I'll call you tomorrow.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.031
Hey. Hey!

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.551
Give me a hug.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.279
I hope you keep your job, Dad.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.661
Okay?

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:55.822
Oh, he has a large ego.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.507
Well, we all know that.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.719
I've never seen him
drunk personally,

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.024
but he's loud, and
he can be annoying,

01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.061
obnoxious.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.079
He reveres the language.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:11.781
He knows more about it than most,

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.559
even most English teachers,

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.399
and he cares.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.479
What more can you
ask from a teacher?

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.145
He really cares.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.919
He's scattered, disorganized,
never has a lesson plan,

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.919
or if he does, he
never sticks to it.

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.429
Most of his assignments
are not even graded.

01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:34.439
It's all very cocky,
seat-of-the-pants, you know,

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.310
all that "I'm a writer" bullsh...

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.671
And the magazine?

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.228
Nothing but an ego
rag for Jack Marcus.

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.021
Excuse me

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.959
for being so blunt.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.119
Thank you.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.719
I hardly know him.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.148
Just your impressions.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.359
Well, I'm impressed by the fact

01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:01.279
that I've been studying
multi-syllable words

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:03.309
just to beat him at his own game.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.839
Um...

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.959
I'm impressed at how the students

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.639
have picked up on this war of his.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.039
You've seen the installations.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.159
They're ideas that the
students came up with,

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.319
and they're good.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.746
They're good.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.679
And, um...

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.391
last night.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.149
I painted my first workable
painting in six months.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.991
Something I thought I
might never do again.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.146
I did it to show him a picture
he could not do justice to

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:40.220
in words.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.303
He's a pest,

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.670
always challenging.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.079
Thank God for that.

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.551
Oh, damn it.

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.839
"Come in," she said.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.079
What do you want?

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.479
"Come in," she said,

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.199
suddenly smiling a
broad, welcoming grin.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.679
Those are for me?

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.267
I don't answer inane questions.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:10.981
They're beautiful.

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.547
Look at this.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.279
Wow. This is good.

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.439
Don't touch it.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.679
It won't be dry for...

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.550
This is really good.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.668
Well, it's um... I'm
still working on it.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.820
It's very different
from what I've done.

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.430
There are vases in the sink.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.799
You paint to this? It's beautiful.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.439
Why did you bring me flowers?

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:10.425
Because I heard what you
said in the review,

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.159
and I thank you.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.906
I've kept my job, Delsanto.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.319
Congratulations.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.951
I want to celebrate.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.350
Are these from the poem?

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.999
Are these your drawings
from the new poem?

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.599
It's nothing, it's just...

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.311
Well, you put them up.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.799
Oh, my God, Delsanto.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:40.999
You should see something.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.359
You should see how you
look in that light.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:46.106
Oh, for God's sake.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.431
I wish I was a painter.

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.119
Words fail.

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.751
Pictures, too.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.987
I can't tell you how much

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.159
I want us to put our
mouths together.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.700
Oh, really?

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.599
You're attracted to me?

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.719
Very much.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.879
Why?

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.279
Same species, different sex.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.866
Aren't you attracted to me?

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.839
Not in the least.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.679
Did you think I would be?

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.919
Well, I had high hopes
for this jacket.

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.239
I mean, it's old, but
it's custom made,

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.065
and yet you feel nothing?

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.999
Admiration.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.199
Good.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:23.740
For your tailor.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.039
God, you're fantastic.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.399
You're such an ass.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.879
You have such an ass.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.199
Oh, you know nothing about my ass.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.359
Excuse me.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.867
I've studied its
dimensions for months.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.799
Delsanto, I am going
to walk over there

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.079
where the light is falling on you,

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.639
and I am going to kiss you,

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:48.501
unless you speak a
loud, resounding no.

01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:10.709
There haven't been any men
in my life for years...

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.719
by choice.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.199
Theirs?

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.759
Mm, this is ridiculous.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.039
No, this is great.

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.719
The tape on your
hand is ridiculous.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.519
Well, take it off then gently.

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.479
Listen to me.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.399
You're covering my ears.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.759
Listen.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:44.559
We can decide right now to
take this afternoon to bed,

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:45.919
no discussion, no debate,

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.239
no words, no pictures,

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.399
no angst, no past, no guilt...

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.067
Will you shut up.

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.510
Hmm?

01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.359
You'd have to be careful.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.799
I've had a vasectomy,
and I'm very clean.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.590
With me, you idiot.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.581
With my body.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.359
You just have to
tell me what hurts,

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.991
where, and how much.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:15.559
This is a terrible idea.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:17.039
No, people do this all the time.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.944
They just have a couple
of dinners first.

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.066
Were you ever married?

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.759
No, why?

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.061
Long relationships?

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:28.461
Uh, I lived with a man in
Barbados for six years.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.319
I was married to a pediatrician.
It ended badly.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.999
I got a son in college.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.799
I got a great aunt who's 107.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:38.239
That could have taken us, you
know, two dinners and a movie

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:42.511
before we got to
your Barbadosian...

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:44.999
and my Aunt Nell,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.305
and yet here we are, ready, now.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.985
I'm feeling better.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.464
The meds seem to be...

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.630
But how can I trust it?

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.079
Not yet.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:07.479
So I want you to know
that if I say yes,

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.384
it's partly because, uh...

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.239
life keeps taking
things away from me,

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.119
and I'm never sure when
it's the last chance

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.919
I have to do something,

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:18.199
and to do it fully,

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:22.141
and if it is, I don't
want to miss it.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.504
Can we do that again?

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.589
Wait, for God's sake.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.599
It's been...

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.584
nine minutes.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.260
I'm not ready.

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.583
Will you give me an ETA then?

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.866
You know, an experience like
that should be savored.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.039
I'll just read until
you've recovered.

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.199
Give me my book.

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.839
Yeah, get a big, thick book.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.559
I'm going to have to fill my
dance card with other suitors.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.359
Give me my book.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:25.999
You Jezebel.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.780
You Rip Van Winkle.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.822
You know, I think the
norm's like, uh,

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.399
20 minutes.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.759
Mmm. Then I'll call Norm.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.024
Norm, come here.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.347
Norm, can you hear me?

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.951
Norm, I'm dying.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.119
Please, Norm.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.906
you're looking a little bit lost

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.719
and forlorn.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.079
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.427
Why is that?

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.069
Is it this?

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.427
- Us?
- No, no, no, no.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.741
Isn't that a beautiful

Don't change the subject.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.503
Delsanto, I don't want to go home.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.501
Can I stay?

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:55.821
Sleeping together,
that's a major step.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.185

- Mm.

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.586

Who's Dina?

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.319
- Dina.
- Dina.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.224
No, that's weird.

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:12.787

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.959
Can you talk? Can you look?

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.079
I'm not feeling well.
The medication.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.427
Can you see this?

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.199
Are you drunk?

01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.707
Look at this picture, it's perfect.

01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:43.079
You, uh...

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.599
You remember this? You...

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:46.799
You remember the poem?

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.279
- Yes, I remember it.
- Yeah, well, listen.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.820
Listen.

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:52.791
I never wrote it.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.141
I stole it.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.467
From my son.

01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:06.399
I did.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.668
I never wrote a poem that good.

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:10.639
Never.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.987
I...

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:16.222
I stole it. I said it was mine.

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.144
I saved my ass.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:21.039
I saved my job.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.944
How could you do that?

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.462
What if the fire just goes out?

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.781
Whoa!

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.545
I need a camera.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:45.119
I just want to capture this look of

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.866
disappointment and revulsion.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.359
You're using the wrong words.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:53.079
No, words are my
business, Delsanto.

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:54.679
Pity is the one you're looking for.

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.266
Yeah, I don't want that.

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:58.624
You can't choose what I feel.

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.119
You want me to go?

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.679
You can't. You're too drunk.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.199
I want you to stop drinking.

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.279
Go lie on the couch and pass out.

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:10.786
Go away.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.439
Oh, shit.

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.027
I want you to walk out of my door.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:32.119
I want you to exit my life.

01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.319
I am so sorry, I...

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.906
I want you to go now

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:40.421
without one... more... word.

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.621
Ah! Ah!

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:08.110
Are you saving these
for your vodka museum?

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.621
Christ, Jack.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:18.519
I see your culinary
skills haven't improved.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.663
You're still eating
beer-battered chicken?

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.191
I'm Jack. Uh, I'm an
English teacher at, uh...

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.905
I'm an alcoholic.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.439
I've been sober for six days.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.359
Just give it to Jesus, man.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.079
Jesus, there's a good teacher.

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.621
You know, Gandhi,
Martin Luther King,

01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:50.599
Mrs. Betty Hilliard, fifth grade,

01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.919
my own personal angel
and role model,

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:56.588
but, uh, I'm not aiming that high.

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.744
I just want to quit drinking.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:04.941
Forever.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.387
Please get to the point,

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:15.559
and if this is Jack
Marcus, good-bye.

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:20.189
The point, Delsanto, is contrition.

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.639
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.279
I'm just hoping you're all right.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:28.904
Are you in any way the
least bit all right?

01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:35.639
You know, good-bye is
actually a shortened version

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:36.839
of God be with you.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:40.986
Anyway, thanks for the thought.

01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:43.319
I'll keep trying.

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.703
For now, so long.

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:50.399
That, by the way,
comes from salaam,

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:52.589
which means peace be with you.

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:57.310
Which is all I'm
really trying to say.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.959
You didn't write the poem?

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.359
It's not yours?

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.319
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.621
Makes me sick.

01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.069
This is my resignation.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.626
I wrote it myself.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.159
If it's possible, I would
like to finish out the year.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.319
Finish out the year then.

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.279
- Thank you.
- No, it's not for you.

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:27.390
It's so no one asks
why, so no one knows.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.260
You can give us that.

01:28:30.280 --> 01:28:31.866
What will you do?

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:36.590
I'll try to find a school that
will take a chance on me.

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:40.182
- I wish you well.
- Oh, God.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.111
Oh, my God.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:57.119
What about the assembly,
Words Versus Pictures?

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.502
It's still on the schedule,

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:02.388
but I don't think you
will have Miss Delsanto.

01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.790
She has asked for medical leave.

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:09.149
Delsanto!

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.586
Medical leave?

01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.543
What are you doing, you hiding?

01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:16.661
Come on!

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.990
You're needed at the school.

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:22.831
You know, don't let me
take that away from you.

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.787
You know, I'm not worth that.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.279
Delsanto!

01:29:28.280 --> 01:29:30.919
- Shut up!
- Just come outside. Take...

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.199
Take a swing at me.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.390
You know, kick me in the balls.

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.184
Thank you. I might.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.199
Her sister, Sabine.

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.559
- Jack Marcus.
- No kidding.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.799
Why are you speaking to that shit?

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.340
No!

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.399
Look, tell her...

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:52.679
Don't say anything stupid, okay?

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.709
Tell her I want to
buy that painting.

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.548
Whatever her price would
have been, I want to buy it.

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.229
The painting is not for sale.

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.399
And she said to tell that
arrogant, self-absorbed asshole

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:22.067
that my medical leave has
nothing to do with him.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.545
She had a knee operation.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.159
- Tell her...
- Oh, make this good.

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.940
She's shutting down, and
it scares me, so step up.

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:33.959
Tell her I want to
tear out my heart,

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.910
I want to hand it to her,

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.270
and I want to watch her eat it.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:40.580
When?!

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:17.719
This is my Dad. Catherine.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.639
It's nice to finally meet you.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.879
Oh, it's a pleasure, really.

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.839
- And Hank.
- Hank.

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:24.187
Nice to meet you.

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.743
Maybe I'll let you two talk.

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:29.959
See you in a minute.

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.625
Yeah.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:35.839
This is a surprise.

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:37.479
She's pretty.

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.719
Nice smile, good energy.

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.021
What's on your mind?

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:49.319
You remember that,
uh, poem you wrote?

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.519
Yeah.

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.079
You know, the one I...
the one I put on my board?

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:53.791
Mm-hmm.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:59.271
I actually told some
people that I wrote it.

01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:03.868
Kind of put my name
on it for a while.

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.707
So now I'm telling
people the truth.

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.624
I'm resigning from the school,

01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:16.591
and I quit drinking.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.639
Now, I know you've
heard that before,

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:24.119
but maybe after time goes
by and you see your father

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:26.468
always sober, never drunk,

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.948
maybe you'll begin to believe me.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.187
And even though I'm awful,

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.907
please don't let me
be dead to you, Tony.

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.951
I love you.

01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:59.511
And I want to know her.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.599
Good-bye!

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:25.221
And that has nothing
to do with God!

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.231
Oh, shit.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.067
Emily!

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.061
Emily?

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.199
Hi.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.599
I thought it was the maniac.

01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.140
Come.

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.708
Oh, wow.

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:49.959
I love this.

01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:52.308
Oh, it's so damaged.

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:55.102
I gave up trying to fix it.

01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.279
No, I can see what you wanted.

01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.599
It's really good.

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.559
It was the best I've done since
my body stopped cooperating.

01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.066
Sit down.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.279
I've been trying so hard to
paint what I see, Emily,

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:18.599
and now I'm learning to
see what I can paint.

01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:20.664
Something that excites me.

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:25.226
Take it. If you like
it, you can have it.

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.984
I can't look at it anymore.

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.589
Thank you. Um...

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:36.903
I want you to see what
I'm painting now.

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.551
I miss your input.

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:43.671
Your not being satisfied.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.199
Bring your work over.

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.390
I'd be glad to be
dissatisfied with it.

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:52.679
- Would you?
- Mm.

01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:55.839
Would you teach me here?

01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:57.039
Hmm?

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:59.547
I mean, on weekends
or after school?

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.599
It's not just me, though.

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.119
Cole Patterson, he would
like lessons, too,

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.639
or maybe some of the others.

01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:11.159
Class is just not the same anymore.

01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.791
Nobody's pushing.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.559
They just go, "That's good, Emily."

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.861
You are good.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:20.599
You're good enough to
please a lot of people,

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:21.901
most people.

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:24.781
Well...

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.359
to hell with them.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.559
Yeah.

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.829
So here we go.

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:37.599
New words!

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:38.839
Yeah!

01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.063
Never before seen.

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.141
Friedman.

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:47.519
Textulating... making
love via texting.

01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.461
Cole.

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:52.279
Uh...

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.239
slumba...

01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:57.639
a Latin dance in an
impoverished neighborhood.

01:35:58.800 --> 01:35:59.959
Say that again.

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.679
A Latin dance in an
impoverished neighborhood.

01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:06.399
Isabella.

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:07.759
Um, emblend.

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.719
To hold somebody close.

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:12.022
Aw, Isabella!

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:15.079
Mr. Marc?

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.799
Mr. Marc, this is cool and all,

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:19.307
but we really want to
talk about your war.

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.799
Yeah, um,

01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:24.639
how can you have a battle
without Miss Delsanto?

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:25.919
She'll be here.

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:27.839
She's not coming.

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.719
She won't be here until next year.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:31.510
That's not acceptable.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.426
She has to.

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.140
She has to.

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:07.759
Hey!

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:20.519
Hey.

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:21.959
Hi.

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.944
Oh, hello again.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.519
I will just go check

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:27.879
and then tell you when
they're ready, okay?

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.341
Okay, that's good.

01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.239
You want to sit down?

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:33.144
Can't sit in that one yet.

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.119
I, uh... I thought
your leg was better.

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.319
Yes.

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:41.590
I can even kick you in the
balls if you try to help me.

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.599
You want something? A drink or...

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:53.981
No, thanks.

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:03.919
- Irrepressibility.
- Oh, for God's sake.

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:06.348
Incorrigibility.
They're both sevens.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.119
Masturbationalistic.

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:10.501
Play with yourself.

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:18.941
Tell me.

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:24.544
Up to the part where I
got disgustingly drunk,

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:28.751
it was good, right?

01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.826
I don't remember.

01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:38.599
I'm sober 36 days.

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:39.839
Oh!

01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:43.064
Well, then you'll probably want
to celebrate with a 12-pack.

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.869
Yes, it was good.

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:49.546
Yes.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.903
That's why I'm so goddamn angry,

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:55.999
because of what you're capable
of and what you throw away,

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.745
what you destroy.

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:00.599
I don't give a damn
about this stupid war.

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:03.559
You'll do the Mr. Marc show,
and the students will vote,

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.239
and you'll win and be happy,

01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.668
and then you can leave me alone.

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.305
I'm only here for Emily.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.383
It's great to see you, Delsanto.

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:29.799
Ladies, gentlemen, welcome
to Words Versus Pictures.

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.945
Yeah!

01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:41.439
Representing Pictures are
the Arts Honors students,

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:43.079
whose works you see surrounding us.

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.039
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:46.479
Hold on.

01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:50.919
And their teacher, the
artist, Miss Dina Delsanto.

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:55.620
It's her art we see on the screens.

01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:58.181
Stanhope?

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:03.119
So which has more impact,

01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:07.061
more value, more worth?

01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.519
The word or the picture?

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:12.879
Come on, pictures!

01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.039
And words! Guys, come on!

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.759
Oh, just clap.

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:19.062
Yeah!

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.639
"A picture is worth a
thousand words." Anonymous.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.501
"There is no frigate like a
book to take us lands away."

01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:33.119
Emily Dickinson.

01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:34.999
"A picture shows me at a glance

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.039
"what it takes dozens of
pages of a book to expound."

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:40.422
Ivan Turgenev.

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:47.199
Shakespeare's portrait appeared
on his First Folio of plays

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.359
with these words...

01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:52.381
"Reader, look not at his
picture, but his book."

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:57.629
"What is the use of a book,
thought Alice, without pictures?"

01:42:58.160 --> 01:42:59.359
Lewis Carroll.

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.439
"A picture is something that
requires as much knavery,

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:07.879
"trickery, and deceit as the
perpetration of a crime."

01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:09.466
Edgar Degas.

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.911
For evidence.

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:31.519
Speaking first, representing
pictures, Miss Delsanto.

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:38.239
It was Mr. Marc's idea
that I repair it.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.780
I hope you don't mind.

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.639
It's great.

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:43.146
It's even better.

01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:48.905
Why art?

01:43:50.040 --> 01:43:53.628
If our senses and consciousness

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:57.300
were entirely in tune with nature,

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:02.759
if we could communicate and
understand each other,

01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:06.599
then there wouldn't
be any need for art.

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:10.746
In fact, we would all be artists,

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.988
because we would all be as one.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.984
I have nothing else to say,

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:22.741
except this?

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:27.625
I started it, and
Emily finished it.

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:30.781
And this.

01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:43.263
And, of course, all the student
paintings you can see here.

01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.706
Thank you.

01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:58.599
Representing words,
Mr. Jack Marcus.

01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.959
Yeah!

01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:02.625
Come on!

01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:10.279
Wow, there's your pictures.

01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:11.799
And here's my thousand words,

01:45:11.800 --> 01:45:13.199
except it's not a thousand.

01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.639
It's roughly 400, but
I think it's enough.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:18.271
There's a problem, though.

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:22.462
If writers are called artists, too,

01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:24.590
then as a fellow artist,

01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:27.862
I'm not in the same
league as Miss Delsanto,

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:30.359
because Delsanto in her art

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:32.150
takes us from here

01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:35.759
to somewhere else.

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:37.839
She takes what we
look at every day,

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:40.461
and she elevates it
out of the ordinary.

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:44.959
As when John Updike looked at
birds sitting randomly on a wire

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:49.265
and called them "punctuation
for an invisible sentence."

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.919
Or Jeanette Winterson describes

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:57.159
"tripping over slabs of
sunshine the size of towns."

01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:00.599
And Joyce Cary speaks
of a cold morning with

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:04.679
"frost on the grass like
condensed moonlight."

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:06.559
And James Agee speaks of men

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.199
removing their stiff
collars in the evening

01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:14.825
and their "newly bared necks
seeming tall and shy."

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:18.959
Each artist makes the
world his or her own,

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.639
and in doing so elevates it.

01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:23.863
And in doing that elevates us,

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:26.269
gives us a larger view.

01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:30.679
"Art is the most intense
mode of individualism

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:32.266
"the world has ever known."

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.260
Oscar Wilde.

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:39.949
Proust said that only through art
can we get outside of ourselves

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.639
and know another's
view of the universe.

01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:46.679
And Agee and Updike and
Winterson and Delsanto,

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:49.839
they give us that view because
they give us themselves

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:53.542
through words, through pictures.

01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.270
And all we can say is...

01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:04.063
Because what we feel
is indescribable.

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:06.479
And the value of artists like that,

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.319
artists like Miss Delsanto,

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:11.879
is that through their
gifts, their agonies,

01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:15.439
their energies, and their vision,

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.344
they make us feel

01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.101
our best.

01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:24.385
They make us want to be

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:28.065
our best.

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:32.028
And I thank her.

01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:38.599
And I thank all of you for
allowing us this opportunity

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:41.999
to honor the artists and the arts,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.631
not through a battle,

01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:48.143
but through a... a coming together,

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:52.741
a mating

01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:59.719
of words and pictures.

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:03.703
Emily, Cole, take it away.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:20.346
Shakespeare said,

01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:24.748
"Shall I compare thee
to a summers day?

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:29.268
"Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.

01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:34.626
"Rough winds do shake the
darling buds of May."

01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.559
I'll just go get the car, okay?

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.464
- And meet you back here in a minute.
- Okay.

01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:57.799
You all right?

01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:59.147
Mm.

01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:03.107
The sun is awfully strong.

01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:08.670
Afraid you'll melt?

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:11.945
Not a chance.

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:16.439
"I refuse to melt,"
said the icicle.

01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:20.461
"Ha ha," said the sun and shined.

01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.391
You know who wrote that?

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:25.821
Your son?

01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:34.546
You ice cold bitch.

01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:40.389
