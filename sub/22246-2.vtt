00:12.053 --> 00:13.555
[phone ringing]

00:14.681 --> 00:16.599
[clanking]

00:21.604 --> 00:22.647
May I help you?

00:23.356 --> 00:25.150
[chuckles] Yes. Thank you.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.235
I need some replacement electrical tape.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.280
Okay. You bring me the empty
and I'll get you a new roll.

00:30.363 --> 00:31.239
Empty what?

00:32.198 --> 00:35.035
The cardboard core that's left
when you run out of tape.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.412
What? Why?

00:38.204 --> 00:39.622
That's the way we do it.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.376
I can't give you a new one
until we get the old.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.377
Are you kidding me?

00:46.296 --> 00:47.130
No.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.092
[mutters] Whatever, Dennis.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.896
[theme music playing]

02:36.072 --> 02:38.950
[disco song playing]

02:40.743 --> 02:43.663
[over PA]  This is your captain speaking.
New York City to the Bay Area...

02:43.746 --> 02:46.833
Just, hey, do me a favor.
Don't mention this to me ever again.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.586
-I'm going to.
-It's the insanest idea I've ever heard.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.629
-I'm going to, Bill.
-We have a job to do.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.799
-We are here to teach.
-Chino, California Medical,

02:54.883 --> 02:57.927
California Men's Colony,
Norco, Soledad, San Quentin--

02:58.011 --> 03:01.180
If you'd said to me, "I want to become
a Beach Boy, take up surfing,

03:01.264 --> 03:03.433
-sit around smoking the vibes."
-Folsom.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.226
Or, "I want to make it in the movies.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.729
Gonna get me a walk-up in West Hollywood
and a Pekingese."

03:07.812 --> 03:10.440
Manson is 30 miles away in Vacaville.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.108
A hop, skip, and a jump.

03:12.483 --> 03:14.819
-You really wanna meet Charlie Manson?
-Why not?

03:14.903 --> 03:16.696
-[flight attendant] Sir.
-Swing by and say hi.

03:16.779 --> 03:17.697
Yeah.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.532
Thank you.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.953
Nobody wants to hear
about that crazy motherfucker.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.121
You know this.

03:25.204 --> 03:28.124
[woman over PA]  Welcome to San Francisco.
Please remain seated...

03:28.208 --> 03:31.878
Besides, when are you gonna find time
for these fireside chats, Holden?

03:34.297 --> 03:35.340
I'll figure it out.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.012
[Tench] Nobody can talk to Manson.

03:41.095 --> 03:43.806
Tom Snyder's been trying to interview him
for years.

03:43.890 --> 03:46.142
We're the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.436
What if his civil rights
are being violated?

03:48.895 --> 03:50.438
Please just get in the car.

04:11.834 --> 04:15.255
[Tench]  In California every year,
35 percent of murders go unsolved.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.675
That's more unsolved murders
than in any other state.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.510
It's partly due to geography.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.720
In the woods, in the mountains,

04:22.804 --> 04:24.847
-ravines, hiking trails--
-You can't get to Manson,

04:24.931 --> 04:27.350
-even if you're a fed.
-[sighs]

04:27.433 --> 04:29.852
CMF treats him like a fucking unicorn.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.273
No one needs to think about psychology
more than the people in Santa Cruz.

04:34.148 --> 04:37.986
-In a homicide situation...
-If you go to Vacaville, meet Ed Kemper.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.948
-[Tench] What happened that triggered him?
-Give me that name again.

04:42.031 --> 04:45.535
Kemper. Ed Kemper.
They call him the "Coed Killer."

04:45.618 --> 04:48.997
[Tench] What about when even the killer
doesn't know why he behaved as he did?

04:49.080 --> 04:51.833
You can't miss the guy.
He's like six foot nine, 285 pounds.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.501
-Whoa. King-size.
-Super king.

04:53.584 --> 04:57.297
-[Tench] Violent murder used to be...
-Killed a bunch of coeds in Santa Cruz.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.550
Six teenage girls, chops their heads off,
has sexual intercourse with the corpses.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.844
-Oh...
-Kills his mom with a claw hammer,

05:02.927 --> 05:04.804
has sexual intercourse with her head.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.931
-Bullshit.
-In her mouth.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.474
-No.
-Yeah.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.644
[Tench] When strangers murder strangers
for no apparent reason...

05:11.728 --> 05:14.647
He was in a mental institution
right up until then too.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.817
He's a total whack job. He was murdering
his grandparents at the age of 15,

05:17.900 --> 05:21.446
but then he manages to convince everyone
that he's completely rehabilitated.

05:21.529 --> 05:22.405
Oh, my God.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.616
In many of these crimes,
the motives are not just obscure...

05:25.700 --> 05:28.703
Jim Conor knew him real well.
I'll introduce you.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.121
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.832
-...borderline unfathomable.
-Thank you.

05:33.791 --> 05:36.377
[Conor]  Used to call him Big Ed.
Everybody here knew him.

05:36.961 --> 05:40.715
-Was he an informant?
-No, but he was smart. He was funny.

05:41.257 --> 05:45.261
He used to watch all the cop shows on TV.
Crazy about Wambaugh and  Police Story.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.764
[Molina] He wanted to be CHP,
but it didn't work out.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.683
He would joke that they could conceal
his psychiatric record

05:50.767 --> 05:51.934
but not his fat ass.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.687
[laughs] Stupid shit like that.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.648
Guys like him
always want to be in uniform.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.151
Losers. Losers are drawn to authority.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.570
Nobody wants to admit it,
but losers are useful.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.530
-Why?
-[Conor] They're nosy.

06:04.614 --> 06:08.284
They know what everybody else is up to.
And they're resentful, a lot of 'em.

06:08.367 --> 06:10.703
-They always got a raw deal.
-Ed was a busybody.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.206
And this was before you knew
about the killings?

06:13.289 --> 06:16.042
Oh, we knew about 'em,
just hadn't connected them with him.

06:16.125 --> 06:19.170
-He kept asking about them, though.
-And you didn't suspect him?

06:21.881 --> 06:22.882
[Conor] What?

06:22.965 --> 06:25.051
"What?" You liked the guy.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.764
-Let's say he was a friendly nuisance.
-Oh, come on.

06:29.847 --> 06:32.600
-He was hard not to like.
-So you were the arresting officer?

06:32.683 --> 06:35.686
In the end,
he lit out to Pueblo, Colorado,

06:35.770 --> 06:37.939
expecting there to be
some kind of manhunt.

06:38.439 --> 06:42.360
When nobody came, he got sick of waiting
and decided to turn himself in.

06:43.027 --> 06:45.488
Called from a pay phone. Confessed!

06:46.197 --> 06:49.283
We thought he was bullshitting.
I drove him all the way back.

06:49.367 --> 06:53.287
He wouldn't stop yakking.
Going into forensic detail.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.872
I thought I hit the jackpot.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.292
After a few hours,
I'm like, "Oh, God, please. Enough!"

06:58.376 --> 07:00.086
You think Kemper would talk to us?

07:00.878 --> 07:02.421
Try stopping him.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.673
Who's "us," kemosabe?

07:08.052 --> 07:10.179
[reporter]  David Berkowitz, 24.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.850
Spent his days sorting letters
at the post office so he could...

07:13.933 --> 07:14.767
What?

07:15.351 --> 07:17.019
Really, what are you expecting to learn?

07:17.603 --> 07:19.981
A killer who can't stop talking?
It's a gift.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.023
A gift, huh?

07:21.691 --> 07:23.901
He made a severed head
perform fellatio on him.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.363
His third victim
was a 15-year-old child, Holden.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.491
You don't want to talk?

07:30.575 --> 07:33.536
So, basically, you just got me out here
to carry your slide projector?

07:33.619 --> 07:36.706
To help with the workload, yeah.
The work we're sanctioned to do.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.792
Kemper doesn't interest you
or is beneath you somehow?

07:39.876 --> 07:40.960
A little of both.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.088
-This is the man...
-[Holden] Think the tie's too much?

07:44.839 --> 07:45.923
What about the suit?

07:46.007 --> 07:48.634
Anybody finds out you're a fed,
there'll be a riot.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.137
Shepard finds out
you've been interviewing the Coed Killer

07:51.220 --> 07:52.847
as a side project, he'll flip his shit.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.475
It's easier to ask forgiveness
than permission.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.810
[sighs] Okay.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.690
If you're gonna go in,
you need to go in stone goddamn cold,

08:02.773 --> 08:05.776
take him by surprise,
get the fuck out as quick as possible.

08:05.860 --> 08:06.694
Good advice.

08:06.777 --> 08:10.573
Straight in there, don't phone,
don't give them a chance to ask around.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.741
I'm a buddy of Jim Conor's.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.661
"Jim Conor reached out," you bet.
"He sends his regards."

08:15.745 --> 08:17.914
"I stopped by the Jury Room for a drink."

08:17.997 --> 08:20.583
"The guys all say..." Blah, blah, blah.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.294
-"Can I call you Big Ed?"
-I wouldn't mention the killings.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.546
You're not there
because he's a necrophile degenerate.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.965
You're there because he's... fascinating.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.759
How do I not mention the killings?

08:30.384 --> 08:31.427
Just take it slow.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.806
-What are you doing?
-Just in case.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.850
They're not gonna let you in
with a sidearm.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.770
The guy is six foot nine,
weighs 300 pounds.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.939
-That's right.
-So what's he gonna do?

08:43.022 --> 08:45.733
He's gonna take the fucking thing away,
kill you with it,

08:45.816 --> 08:47.902
and then have sex with your face.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.992
[metal clanking]

09:03.334 --> 09:04.377
Hold it, guys.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.968
-You're clear.
-[Holden] I don't want to spoil your fun.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.844
-I'm good. Nine is fine.
-[buzzer sounds]

09:13.928 --> 09:15.846
You could come. Take notes.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.182
You take notes,
I'll help you write 'em up.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.809
You're really gonna go golfing

09:19.892 --> 09:22.937
while I glean profound insights
from the Coed Killer?

09:23.020 --> 09:24.981
-It's my day off.
-You're gonna be sorry.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.482
No. You're gonna be sorry, Holden,

09:26.566 --> 09:29.527
when he decides you're using him
and there's nothing in it for good old Ed.

09:29.610 --> 09:30.987
-I think there is.
-What?

09:31.529 --> 09:34.949
He's going to be part of something
instead of rotting inside a cell.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.368
Part of what? We're not even here.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.162
[bell rings]

09:40.246 --> 09:41.080
All right.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.047
[man]  I must respectfully ask
for your badge and firearm.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.468
Yes, sir.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.562
In addition,
I have some paperwork for you to sign.

10:04.645 --> 10:08.232
A disclaimer that states in the event
of your death, or if you're taken hostage,

10:08.316 --> 10:11.235
attacked, assaulted, or otherwise abused
within the correctional facility,

10:11.319 --> 10:14.572
the United States government
forswears any and all liability.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.701
Oh. [clicks tongue] Okay.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.874
[buzzer sounds]

10:29.837 --> 10:31.589
[buzzer sounds]

10:38.262 --> 10:41.891
[indistinct chatter, shouting]

10:47.313 --> 10:48.648
[man] Kiss my ass!

10:59.408 --> 11:01.494
[man 2] Hey, boy,
bring that shit over here!

11:01.577 --> 11:02.578
[man 3] Bitch!

11:05.039 --> 11:07.541
[shouting, chatter continues]

11:09.168 --> 11:12.088
[man screaming]

11:18.386 --> 11:21.764
[indistinct chatter]

11:31.482 --> 11:32.733
[keys jangle]

11:45.496 --> 11:47.540
Can we unlock the--

11:47.623 --> 11:49.500
No, those stay on. They're regulation.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.003
I think that's gonna be
a little awkward.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.132
You're FBI.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.392
-Okay. You're all set.
-Thanks, Jim.

12:06.475 --> 12:08.227
-[Jim] I'll see ya later.
-Later.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.690
[door locks]

12:16.485 --> 12:17.570
Holden, right?

12:20.406 --> 12:22.283
-Edward.
-Edmund.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.869
-Oh, I'm sorry. I assumed that it was--
-Are you tired?

12:24.952 --> 12:26.287
How could you tell?

12:26.370 --> 12:28.831
It's a beautiful drive, but it's long.

12:30.499 --> 12:33.335
Edmund was my mom's idea,
so you can call me Ed.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.631
Sure thing.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.343
So how can I help?

12:42.928 --> 12:44.763
Okay. Um...

12:46.390 --> 12:50.186
I'm an instructor working out of
the Behavioral Science Unit at Quantico,

12:50.269 --> 12:51.437
and I had this idea--

12:51.520 --> 12:52.980
Have you had breakfast?

12:53.063 --> 12:55.483
Can I get you something?
You want a sandwich?

12:56.066 --> 12:58.861
-No, I'm okay.
-What kind of sandwich you like?

13:00.154 --> 13:04.200
-Um... I'm good.
-You want an egg salad sandwich?

13:04.700 --> 13:08.120
-I'm fine. Really.
-I'll get us an egg salad sandwich.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.915
I can get almost anything you want
from the canteen.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.213
Okay.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.383
-Do you have tuna?
-Oh, the egg salad's better.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.094
-Hey, Jim?
-[Jim] Yeah, Ed?

13:24.178 --> 13:27.389
[Ed] Have you seen Mitch this morning?
You think you can find him for me?

13:29.141 --> 13:30.351
[Holden clears throat]

13:31.519 --> 13:33.521
-Good, huh?
-Mmm!

13:34.063 --> 13:35.397
These guys are great.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.776
I've been here five years.
We just clicked right off the bat.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.320
You like the guards?

13:42.488 --> 13:44.156
Well, they like me. I'm polite.

13:44.782 --> 13:49.870
You know, I heard that you used to drink
at the Jury Room.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.164
You mean in Santa Cruz?

13:52.665 --> 13:54.917
Yeah, those are good guys.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.587
I applied to California Highway Patrol.

13:58.671 --> 14:03.175
My mom spoke to the cops
to get my psychiatric record expunged.

14:03.259 --> 14:07.429
Turns out my record didn't bother them
at all, I was just too tall.

14:07.513 --> 14:11.725
Too tall? [laughs]
I've heard of being too short, but...

14:13.936 --> 14:14.937
What?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.897
Nothing. It just seems...

14:16.981 --> 14:18.566
You think they lied to me?

14:20.651 --> 14:21.485
No.

14:22.945 --> 14:26.115
Well, cops like me
because they can talk to me...

14:27.032 --> 14:29.952
more than they can talk
to their own wives, some of them.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.579
Really? What do you talk about?

14:32.121 --> 14:33.581
You know, books, movies.

14:33.664 --> 14:36.584
I watch all the cop shows on TV.

14:36.667 --> 14:37.793
Do you know, uh...

14:39.211 --> 14:42.131
Joseph Wambaugh,  Police Story?
You ever watch that?

14:42.214 --> 14:43.465
-[laughs] Huge fan.
-Oh.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.552
I got a lot of my insights right there.

14:46.635 --> 14:47.511
Really?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.180
What kind of insights?

14:50.264 --> 14:52.141
Well, so, for example, with cops,

14:52.224 --> 14:54.810
I would not allow myself
to walk into a trap

14:54.894 --> 14:58.689
because I knew exactly how their minds
worked from watching Wambaugh.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.524
What kind of trap are you talking about?

15:00.608 --> 15:02.985
The classic is talking too much
about the crimes.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.111
Over-interest.

15:04.653 --> 15:06.488
You have to remain casual.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.575
They tried everything to trick me.
I'm too savvy.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.619
I don't fucking talk, period.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.539
Really? That's interesting.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.457
So...

15:18.000 --> 15:19.543
you had this idea?

15:19.627 --> 15:20.753
Yes. Uh, yes.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.173
It's kind of, uh...

15:27.509 --> 15:30.012
Well, it's more of a research thing.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.096
Research.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.349
Just a series of interviews,

15:33.891 --> 15:35.100
chatting with...

15:36.310 --> 15:39.438
individuals not unlike yourself.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.066
We're just talking?

15:43.233 --> 15:45.945
I don't get to go someplace,
do a bunch of tests?

15:46.028 --> 15:48.238
No. Yeah, no tests. Just right here.

15:48.781 --> 15:49.615
Why?

15:50.199 --> 15:52.493
Well, because I believe
it could be useful.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.371
Talking about what?

15:55.913 --> 15:57.206
Well, I don't know.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.209
Your...

16:01.293 --> 16:03.379
behavior, I guess.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.632
If you want to, that is.

16:06.715 --> 16:10.386
We don't have to talk about
anything at all if you don't want to.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.722
Why are you so tense?

16:13.806 --> 16:14.723
[Holden] Hm?

16:15.224 --> 16:16.976
You're tense, right now.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.061
No, I'm not tense.

16:21.397 --> 16:24.108
Well, I'll be honest,
I don't get many visitors.

16:24.191 --> 16:27.486
When I do, you think
they want to talk about this shit?

16:28.028 --> 16:31.115
Fuck no. It's like if you worked
at a slaughterhouse with livestock,

16:31.198 --> 16:33.033
real conversation stopper.

16:33.617 --> 16:34.451
Did you?

16:34.535 --> 16:36.328
No, I'm just saying...

16:37.079 --> 16:39.790
People who hunt other people
for a vocation,

16:39.873 --> 16:42.751
all we want to talk about
is what it's like.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.255
The shit that went down.
The entire fucked-upness of it.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.465
Right, sure.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.094
It's not easy.
Butchering people is hard work.

16:52.803 --> 16:56.223
Physically and mentally.
I don't think people realize.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.599
You need to vent.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.353
What are you writing down?

17:01.437 --> 17:05.733
Oh, I just think it's an interesting
choice of words, "vocation."

17:07.276 --> 17:08.861
Well, what would you call it?

17:09.987 --> 17:12.781
A hobby? I'd say it's more than that.

17:13.449 --> 17:17.619
Look at the consequences.
The stakes are very high.

17:21.582 --> 17:24.043
Is this helping?
Are you getting what you came for?

17:24.126 --> 17:25.544
-I think.
-Good.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.546
Can I-- Could I just ask you something?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.050
Do you believe that prison can help you?

17:31.633 --> 17:32.634
Are you kidding?

17:33.177 --> 17:35.637
You think you shouldn't be in prison?

17:35.721 --> 17:39.683
I think it's shutting the barn door
after the horse has bolted, somewhat.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.811
What do you think
the state should do with you instead?

17:42.895 --> 17:46.398
Well, Holden,
a lobotomy's not out of the question.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.691
Lobotomy?

17:47.775 --> 17:49.234
Like Frances Farmer.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.279
-You remember Frances Farmer?
-No.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.782
I loved Frances Farmer.
She was an actress.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.034
They lobotomized her in the '50s.

17:57.117 --> 18:02.748
She was very smart and intense...
very misunderstood. She was a lot like me.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.334
You don't think you could benefit
from psychiatry?

18:05.626 --> 18:08.629
I already did all that in the institution.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.507
It didn't take.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.011
For me, I think surgery
might give me the best chance.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.473
And if surgery doesn't... take,

18:19.932 --> 18:24.686
in this modern society, what do we do
with the Ed Kempers of the world?

18:25.312 --> 18:27.106
Well, isn't that your department?

18:30.400 --> 18:31.735
From your perspective.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.700
Death by torture?

18:58.011 --> 19:00.681
[Ed]  So what are you not telling me?

19:01.265 --> 19:03.684
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

19:03.767 --> 19:05.936
-Like what?
-Funny.

19:06.019 --> 19:08.981
You keep looking at me
like I'm a specimen.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.317
[sighs] Well, to be honest...

19:14.069 --> 19:16.321
It's just you seem like a nice,
ordinary...

19:17.614 --> 19:21.160
It's difficult for me to square you
with what you're in prison for.

19:22.452 --> 19:23.370
Oh.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.289
Well, sure.

19:28.083 --> 19:31.336
I was a regular guy most of my life,

19:31.420 --> 19:33.755
with a nice home, nice suburb.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.841
I had pets, I went to a good school.

19:35.924 --> 19:39.970
I was a thoughtful, educated,
well brought up young person.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.805
There's no question about it.

19:42.681 --> 19:43.515
But...

19:45.184 --> 19:46.685
at the same time...

19:47.561 --> 19:51.732
I was living a vile, depraved,
entirely parallel other life

19:51.815 --> 19:55.986
filled with debased violence and mayhem,
and fear, and death.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.029
Well...

19:57.821 --> 20:02.618
it certainly seems to me
like you had your own unusual...

20:03.994 --> 20:06.038
An unusual MO. Oh, sure.

20:06.121 --> 20:08.582
Well, I was gonna say...

20:09.249 --> 20:10.292
signature.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.628
An   oeuvre ,  if you will.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.755
You could study it.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.134
You can spell   oeuvre, can't you, Holden?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.764
You know, there's a lot more like me.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.267
Do you think so?

20:28.185 --> 20:29.895
People that kill in sequence like you did?

20:29.978 --> 20:31.980
-Sequence?
-One right after another.

20:32.522 --> 20:33.607
At regular intervals.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.234
I've just been calling them...

20:36.193 --> 20:37.819
"sequence killers"...

20:38.654 --> 20:39.655
if you will.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.699
-How many would you say?
-Well...

20:44.785 --> 20:46.411
it would be a guess,

20:46.495 --> 20:48.956
but I'd say right now...

20:51.166 --> 20:53.877
North America, more than 35.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.003
Thirty-five?

20:55.087 --> 20:59.132
But you're never gonna find them
if they don't want you to. Not even close.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.802
That can't be right.

21:01.885 --> 21:05.097
Well, Holden, I'm not an expert.
I'm not an authority.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.809
I'm just
an extremely accomplished murderer

21:08.892 --> 21:12.646
who spent my adult life
successfully evading capture...

21:13.689 --> 21:17.276
until I gave myself up
because I despaired of ever being caught.

21:19.194 --> 21:20.779
So take it or leave it.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.490
What do you want from me?

21:23.991 --> 21:24.950
[sighs]

21:26.743 --> 21:28.036
I have no idea.

21:28.829 --> 21:32.249
His   oeuvre?
What the fuck? He's Stanley Kubrick?

21:32.332 --> 21:34.668
He was extremely talkative.

21:34.751 --> 21:37.963
He likes talking to cops.
He's lonely. He could do it all day.

21:38.046 --> 21:40.549
He's not some frenzied thrill killer,
Bill.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.926
I think we need to face that.

21:43.260 --> 21:46.680
He chopped off women's heads
and had sex with their corpses.

21:46.763 --> 21:48.807
If that's not frenzied,
I don't know what is.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.058
He is so articulate.

21:50.642 --> 21:54.604
He's meticulous and highly intelligent.

21:54.688 --> 21:59.401
Yeah, he meticulously chose small, young,
female prey who couldn't fight back.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.028
Animal cunning.

22:01.111 --> 22:04.197
He's self-aware and objective.
Isn't that highly unusual?

22:04.281 --> 22:05.824
He's saying everything you want to hear,

22:05.907 --> 22:08.285
just like he did with the shrinks
in the institution.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.121
He knew just enough to talk his way out,
then went hunting.

22:11.204 --> 22:14.082
-Don't be stupid about this.
-What makes you so sure I'm being stupid?

22:14.166 --> 22:15.500
I know these fuckers.

22:15.584 --> 22:18.420
It's only a matter of time
before he hits you up for privileges.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.340
-Next, he's complaining to the warden--
-Come with me next weekend.

22:21.423 --> 22:24.801
-See for yourself.
-No, I'm not gonna do that.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.470
You're just going to play golf?

22:27.304 --> 22:30.223
It helps me think clearly.
You might want to try it.

22:32.934 --> 22:35.979
-[panting] Oh, yeah. Up a little.
-[Holden] Uh-huh.

22:38.231 --> 22:41.485
-Over a little. Left.
-My left or your left?

22:41.568 --> 22:42.611
My left.

22:43.779 --> 22:44.946
[panting]

22:45.822 --> 22:46.698
This okay?

22:46.782 --> 22:48.241
It's fine. What's wrong?

22:48.325 --> 22:50.619
-You want a break?
-Why would I want a break?

22:50.702 --> 22:52.621
-That's not how it works.
-All right.

22:52.871 --> 22:56.124
You want me to throw in something?
Play with your nipples?

22:56.208 --> 22:57.959
-Why?
-Move it along.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.670
-You're doing great. Just stop stopping.
-Okay.

23:00.754 --> 23:03.757
[moaning]

23:03.840 --> 23:05.133
He knows more about lust murder

23:05.217 --> 23:07.511
than the whole
FBI Behavioral Science Unit.

23:07.594 --> 23:10.514
-We should put him on the payroll.
-Would the FBI ever do that?

23:10.597 --> 23:11.640
Doubtful.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.601
Everyone's freaked out
that Berkowitz might sell his life story.

23:14.684 --> 23:17.437
New York State is moving
to make that sort of thing illegal.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.606
It'd be awful
for the families of the victims.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.316
-[waitress] What can I get you?
-Hi.

23:21.399 --> 23:23.777
Uh, can I get two eggs over medium,

23:23.860 --> 23:26.947
home-fried potatoes,
and wheat toast with grape jelly?

23:27.030 --> 23:28.865
-And for you?
-Uh...

23:28.949 --> 23:31.660
-I'll just have an Ed salad sandwich--
-A what?

23:31.743 --> 23:35.497
-An  egg  salad sandwich. Thank you.
-Holden, you don't even like egg salad.

23:35.580 --> 23:38.333
-[waitress] Thank you.
-Right. Um...

23:38.416 --> 23:40.001
I'll just have a Denver omelet.

23:41.419 --> 23:44.548
You've got mention-itis.
You cannot stop mentioning him.

23:44.631 --> 23:47.426
Think of how much we can learn
from a guy like Kemper.

23:48.176 --> 23:50.095
He called it a vocation.

23:50.178 --> 23:51.096
-Killing women?
-Yeah.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.890
Jesus. How do you wrap your mind
around that?

23:54.975 --> 23:56.434
Couldn't attract them.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.186
Didn't have the social skills.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.063
That would describe a lot of guys.

24:01.565 --> 24:02.983
Why does he hate women?

24:03.483 --> 24:04.818
I should ask.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.612
-But not outright.
-No?

24:07.696 --> 24:10.991
He sounds like the kind of person
who would tell you what you wanna hear.

24:11.074 --> 24:13.785
-You have to disarm him first.
-You mean, like...

24:14.911 --> 24:17.747
-What?
-Ask him questions about himself.

24:18.748 --> 24:21.877
Lean into him, listen intently.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.713
-I do that.
-Keep your arms uncrossed.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.465
Mirror his movements.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.178
Encourage him to talk
about the things he's excited about.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.180
Are these feminine wiles?

24:33.263 --> 24:35.473
Cross your legs in his direction.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.060
-Do you really do that?
-But don't touch him.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.521
You want him to like you,

24:42.063 --> 24:44.649
but you don't want him to think
you're gonna fuck him.

24:47.110 --> 24:50.030
[laughing] Look at your face.

24:54.743 --> 24:58.747
[indistinct chatter, shouting]

24:58.830 --> 24:59.873
[Holden]  Here's the thing.

24:59.956 --> 25:03.376
I spent five years as a brick agent
and a couple of years at the academy.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.545
-I'm squeaky clean.
-[Ed] Oh.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.297
[Holden] I'm Eliot Ness. I'm--

25:07.380 --> 25:09.424
You're Melvin Purvis, G-MAN.

25:09.507 --> 25:10.508
Exactly.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.385
And back then, no skirt in the FBI.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.262
-No women, just men.
-Wow.

25:14.346 --> 25:19.017
Then I enroll in college,
and suddenly, I am Warren fucking Beatty.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.228
-Wow.
-Everything goes.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.771
-You take sugar?
-No.

25:22.854 --> 25:24.314
-Cool. Milk?
-Thank you.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.983
-You got it, man.
-Suddenly it's disco and poppers,

25:27.067 --> 25:28.360
and fern bars.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.695
I am up to my neck in chicks.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.405
Pussy, pussy, pussy. I hear that.

25:32.489 --> 25:36.534
It turns out chicks do really dig a guy
with a badge.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.162
"Gas, grass, or ass.
Nobody rides for free."

25:39.246 --> 25:42.249
Next thing I know, I'm with a 24-year-old
that I met in a bar.

25:42.332 --> 25:45.835
No woman has ever been so into me
in my entire life.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.337
Don't brag. It's unbecoming.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.339
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

25:49.422 --> 25:50.548
I'm kidding.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.050
[Holden] Man...

25:54.469 --> 25:56.846
the things she comes up with in the sack.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.598
You gotta love that young pussy.

25:59.182 --> 26:01.142
I do. I really fucking do.

26:01.226 --> 26:05.814
You gotta make it with that young pussy
real quick before it turns into Mom.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.025
Yeah.

26:11.778 --> 26:15.073
So you were a virgin up until then,
that's what you're saying?

26:15.156 --> 26:18.285
-No, not at all.
-Oh, you go over like you're a virgin.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.870
-What?
-What's wrong with that?

26:20.954 --> 26:22.205
I was a virgin for years.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.333
Oh, no, there's nothing wrong with it,
it's just I'm... not.

26:25.750 --> 26:26.751
Uh-huh.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.463
This new girl, she take it up the ass?

26:33.508 --> 26:35.302
We haven't really discussed it.

26:35.385 --> 26:36.594
Ask her.

26:36.678 --> 26:39.973
An asshole will suck your cock right in,
literally.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.683
It's like a hole that sucks.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.476
[makes slurping sound] It's easy.

26:44.269 --> 26:47.731
But when you fuck somebody in the neck,
it's entirely the opposite.

26:47.814 --> 26:51.651
It's nothing but resistance.
It's really difficult.

26:51.735 --> 26:52.944
Let me.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.529
You feel this?

26:54.612 --> 26:56.614
Feel it. It's all muscle.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.325
Cartilaginous.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.368
[wheezes, coughs]

27:01.911 --> 27:03.288
Is this interesting?

27:03.747 --> 27:07.876
-Oh, yeah.
-Because I can skip some of the detail.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.961
No, I'm here for the detail.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.797
A major college campus.

27:12.881 --> 27:16.634
It's like a giant candy store,
you know what I mean.

27:16.718 --> 27:17.636
Right.

27:18.303 --> 27:23.933
Your, uh, your mom worked on campus
at UCSC, right?

27:24.476 --> 27:26.061
Remind me again what she did.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.691
-Administrative assistant.
-Right.

27:35.403 --> 27:38.823
That's all she lived for, man,
her work and her precious coeds,

27:38.907 --> 27:40.909
whom she mothered relentlessly.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.828
Do you think
that she neglected you for them?

27:43.912 --> 27:45.372
Put it this way,

27:45.872 --> 27:49.918
she had a very violently
outspoken position on men.

27:51.252 --> 27:53.671
She had a failed marriage with my father.

27:53.755 --> 27:55.924
I looked a lot like him, so...

27:56.007 --> 27:57.509
You reminded her of him.

28:00.261 --> 28:03.431
Do you think you developed a dislike
for young women as a result?

28:04.015 --> 28:05.975
As far as she was concerned,

28:06.601 --> 28:10.480
I was never going to end up
with one of those girls

28:10.563 --> 28:12.857
because I was a fuckup
and an embarrassment.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.026
-You were a failure in her eyes.
-Look.

28:15.527 --> 28:19.572
My mother was a decent, upstanding,
reasonable woman,

28:19.656 --> 28:21.908
but when it came to me,

28:21.991 --> 28:24.035
she had nothing but contempt,

28:24.703 --> 28:26.830
disappointment, and disdain.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.291
That must've been awful.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.002
Well, here's the thing.

28:37.632 --> 28:38.675
I'm listening.

28:42.137 --> 28:46.141
Women are born with this little hole
between their legs...

28:47.058 --> 28:50.812
which every man on earth
just wants to stick something into.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.149
And they're weaker than men,

28:55.108 --> 28:57.402
so they learn strategies.

28:57.485 --> 29:00.530
They deploy their minds and their sex,

29:00.613 --> 29:03.575
and they intuitively learn to humiliate.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.037
Did your mother humiliate you?

29:14.043 --> 29:15.003
Ed?

29:20.049 --> 29:21.676
[buzzer sounds]

29:28.850 --> 29:30.435
[buzzer sounds]

29:36.024 --> 29:38.401
[Holden] Lust murder doesn't cut it.

29:38.485 --> 29:42.530
He did not stab, and rape, and decapitate
Mom because he was aroused.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.449
He was conditioned to do it.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.951
-Did he say that?
-As good as.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.203
It's schtick.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.205
He learned the vernacular
in the institution.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.957
-He's sophisticated enough to use it.
-No, that's not my instinct.

29:53.041 --> 29:56.294
Is it your instinct he was choosing words
carefully or did he just spew it out?

29:56.377 --> 29:57.212
Very carefully.

29:57.295 --> 30:00.882
He's got you pegged. He's telling you
what he's guessed you want to hear.

30:01.424 --> 30:04.427
-But why would I want to hear that?
-Because you're you.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.721
You told him
about your university education,

30:06.805 --> 30:09.265
and your sassy girlfriend,
and your sensitive character,

30:09.349 --> 30:11.226
and he tailored his bullshit to fit.

30:12.727 --> 30:15.396
-Why did you tell him that stuff?
-To loosen him up.

30:16.564 --> 30:19.150
Why do you feel the need
to tell him about your girlfriend?

30:19.234 --> 30:20.652
Just to get him talking.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.404
Holden, he's had seven years
in a correctional facility.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.490
He's been practicing. Don't encourage him.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.659
-I was trying to disarm him.
-You're a federal agent.

30:27.742 --> 30:30.495
Don't give him anything.
He's your subject. Be objective.

30:30.578 --> 30:33.331
-I've gotta trust my instincts on this.
-There's that word again.

30:33.414 --> 30:35.542
So in Fairfield, Iowa
you were in the Dark Ages,

30:35.625 --> 30:38.795
and now suddenly, you have
all these unimpeachable instincts?

30:39.254 --> 30:40.547
Well, it's been a process.

30:40.630 --> 30:43.091
Okay, look, there's no doubt
whatever happened in there

30:43.174 --> 30:45.176
was a profound experience for you,

30:45.260 --> 30:47.846
but I need you to understand
that whatever you think,

30:47.929 --> 30:52.350
there is a distinct possibility
that he's manipulating you.

Gentleman, I'm Detective Roy Carver.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.987
Listen, I was a little late
for the presentation,

32:28.071 --> 32:29.364
but that was just great.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.699
-Well, thank you very much.
-Glad to be of service.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.702
Listen, before you go,
I was hoping I could ask you something.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.913
I know you're not just here to teach.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.833
-No, we really just teach, Roy.
-Pretty much all we focus on.

32:40.917 --> 32:44.253
I was hoping I could get you to take
a look at something a little, uh...

32:44.337 --> 32:45.254
unusual.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.924
Oh, sure thing.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.348
Her name's Rosemary Gonzales,
73 years old.

32:55.431 --> 32:58.726
Her husband died of cancer
so she sold the family farm in Chico,

32:58.810 --> 33:01.354
moved to Sacramento
to be closer to the grandkids.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.984
Two weeks ago, we find her beaten
within an inch of her life

33:06.067 --> 33:07.527
in a doorway to her back porch.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.070
She hasn't been robbed.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.656
She's been groped and assaulted
but not penetrated,

33:11.739 --> 33:14.826
and the little dog's throat's been cut.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.579
Was the dog killed
because it was protecting her?

33:18.663 --> 33:20.123
Or for some other reason?

33:20.206 --> 33:22.333
That I don't know. But it's interesting.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.626
Why didn't he stab her?

33:24.627 --> 33:25.962
Didn't have the nerve?

33:26.045 --> 33:29.632
I don't think some Latino with a shiv
got scared of a little old lady.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.468
Why do you say that?
Why do you say "Latino" like that?

33:32.552 --> 33:34.345
That's the neighborhood, spics and blacks.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.723
Did she identify anybody
of that ethnicity?

33:36.806 --> 33:40.018
No. She was hovering in and out
of a coma for the past ten days.

33:40.101 --> 33:43.271
Now she's finally come around,
she has no recollection whatsoever.

33:43.771 --> 33:45.565
You think it's about a little dog?

33:45.648 --> 33:48.234
Scottish Terriers can be loud.
Their bark...

33:48.317 --> 33:50.486
-Could be annoying.
-Listen...

33:51.529 --> 33:55.033
we need to know exactly
how worried we need to be.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.782
[Rosemary]  My husband would've cried
to see me like this.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.494
Me, I don't cry. I'm tough.

34:40.244 --> 34:43.247
But he was just like a baby.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.542
It would've destroyed
his faith in humanity.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.129
What did I ever do?

34:51.464 --> 34:53.466
Who would do such a thing?

34:55.051 --> 34:56.886
I never hurt a soul.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.597
I don't have any enemies.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.350
I don't dress like a whore.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.894
-I'm an old lady--
-[woman]  Está bien.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.479
[whimpers]

35:06.979 --> 35:08.314
Let me ask you something.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.025
Did your dog ever bite anyone?

35:11.400 --> 35:12.485
Never.

35:12.568 --> 35:15.738
Ever bother anyone by barking?
Any complaints from neighbors?

35:15.822 --> 35:19.200
[Rosemary] No. He was very well-behaved.

35:21.160 --> 35:24.413
-Who cuts the grass, Rosie?
-Who helps you take care of the yard?

35:25.164 --> 35:27.667
I have all sorts of help. Kids mostly.

35:27.750 --> 35:28.668
Which kids?

35:29.460 --> 35:30.878
[Rosemary] Just local kids.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.214
It's a very close community.

35:33.297 --> 35:36.134
And you didn't recognize your assailant?
He wasn't familiar?

35:37.593 --> 35:39.220
I just don't remember.

35:41.556 --> 35:42.974
Do you have kids?

35:43.057 --> 35:44.058
Two daughters.

35:44.767 --> 35:45.810
[Tench] Married?

35:46.435 --> 35:49.355
The eldest is divorced.  Dios mío.

35:50.231 --> 35:52.441
The younger I don't see that often.

35:52.525 --> 35:54.110
Can you remember anything else?

35:54.235 --> 35:55.736
Was he big, little?

35:56.195 --> 35:59.991
Do you remember any moles, scars,
tattoos, distinctive marks?

36:00.074 --> 36:01.993
I remember moonlight.

36:03.744 --> 36:04.787
And...

36:07.540 --> 36:09.625
I do remember a smell.

36:10.918 --> 36:12.170
What kind of smell?

36:12.753 --> 36:14.672
[Rosemary] I don't know, he just...

36:16.340 --> 36:18.801
-He stank.
-[Tench] Like what?

36:18.885 --> 36:21.053
Grease or gasoline, fertilizer?

36:21.137 --> 36:22.221
[Rosemary] Like a bum.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.599
Like somebody who needed to wash.

36:25.224 --> 36:28.519
Seventeen, eighteen-year-old
high school kid,

36:28.603 --> 36:31.022
low self-esteem, hates authority,

36:31.606 --> 36:33.733
doesn't get along well with his parents.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.735
What, just some punk?

36:35.818 --> 36:37.778
Gets into a fight
with his old man one night,

36:37.862 --> 36:42.575
maybe he gets a hold of a bottle of liquor
and comes across the house,

36:42.658 --> 36:46.204
recognizes the place because he cut
the grass there when he was younger.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.289
-Some neighborhood kid?
-[Holden] He goes inside.

36:48.956 --> 36:52.376
She doesn't recognize him,
thinks he's broken in, and starts yelling.

36:52.835 --> 36:54.378
The fight gets physical.

36:54.462 --> 36:57.423
He's drunk, he beats the shit out of her.

36:58.216 --> 37:02.470
He knifes the dog
because the dog is yapping its head off.

37:03.179 --> 37:04.305
And then he runs.

37:05.264 --> 37:07.975
Are you guys serious? A teenager?

37:08.059 --> 37:09.227
He has bad hygiene.

37:09.560 --> 37:13.147
Doesn't bathe
because bathing is what his parents want.

37:13.231 --> 37:16.067
Look, we got a lot of kids like that
around here.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.488
But what kind of degenerate
carves up a little dog?

37:20.571 --> 37:22.657
Maybe the kid saw the dog in the yard,

37:22.740 --> 37:26.577
decided to conduct a moonlight experiment
with his Bowie knife, gets interrupted.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.206
A careful, considerate old lady
would bring her dog in at night.

37:30.289 --> 37:33.668
She went outside with the dog
because she heard something.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.544
[Carver] Listen.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.213
It was a harvest moon.

37:38.714 --> 37:42.134
We have been tossing the idea around
that maybe it's one of these, uh...

37:42.385 --> 37:44.220
you know, satanic deals.

37:44.303 --> 37:47.265
You know, like maybe the dog is some kind
of ritual sacrifice or something.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.432
[inhales sharply]

37:49.141 --> 37:50.059
Check.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.648
You need to squeeze
the neighborhood kids.

37:55.731 --> 37:56.941
One of them knows something.

37:57.024 --> 37:59.652
We had a kid like that,
brought him in for questioning twice.

37:59.735 --> 38:00.778
Bring him in again.

38:00.861 --> 38:02.488
We're gonna get pushback
from the family.

38:02.571 --> 38:04.156
His aunt works for the county.

38:04.240 --> 38:07.201
-Then make it formal.
-I'm probably gonna need a warrant.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.203
We might be able to help you with that.

38:16.335 --> 38:17.295
Fuck!

38:19.797 --> 38:23.175
Nancy's gonna kill me.
We can't get a flight till Sunday.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.640
-Maybe this kid's like Kemper.
-We have to get a room.

38:29.724 --> 38:32.810
I can take care of the room.
We can turn this into an opportunity.

38:32.893 --> 38:36.105
-It could help with the Gonzales case.
-I can't believe I'm stuck with you.

38:36.188 --> 38:38.065
-We can talk to Kemper.
-No!

38:38.149 --> 38:40.192
-I'm gonna play golf.
-Come with me.

38:40.276 --> 38:42.236
I'm not consulting with Ed Kemper.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.655
Not to consult. Just background.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.282
When did his behavior escalate?

38:46.365 --> 38:48.409
You can't stay away
from that motherfucker, can you?

38:48.492 --> 38:50.536
No, please. Don't say "motherfucker."

38:51.120 --> 38:53.414
You know that he'll respond
to your seniority.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.167
-You could really smoke him out.
-No, not now.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.712
We're stuck here all weekend.
What else are you gonna do?

39:01.088 --> 39:02.673
I said forget about it, man.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.343
[exhales]

39:05.843 --> 39:07.845
[buzzer sounds]

39:14.518 --> 39:18.314
So, you're the big boss, right?

39:18.397 --> 39:21.609
Well, I established
the Behavioral Science Unit years ago,

39:21.692 --> 39:23.778
but Holden's come in
with a lot of new ideas.

39:23.861 --> 39:27.323
So Holden's
the intrepid rookie investigator?

39:27.406 --> 39:30.326
Bill taught me everything I know
about criminal behavior.

39:30.409 --> 39:33.287
Is that right?
Well, let me ask you something, Bill.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.998
What do you think
about Joseph Wambaugh?

39:36.082 --> 39:38.751
He knows Joe. Right, Bill?

39:39.502 --> 39:40.419
Well...

39:40.503 --> 39:43.214
Actually,
he based a lot of that stuff on Bill.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.842
-No shit.
-Uh-huh.

39:46.926 --> 39:49.303
[Holden] Not the, uh, stories,

39:49.387 --> 39:52.598
but the psychological insights
and the vernacular.

39:52.681 --> 39:53.557
Yeah.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.768
That is fascinating.

39:56.268 --> 39:59.021
I sure would love
to pick your brain sometime.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.981
Well, that's another life sentence
right there.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.317
-[chuckles]
-[Holden] Maybe you could, uh...

40:03.401 --> 40:06.070
talk about your background
a little bit with Bill.

40:06.654 --> 40:10.366
Maybe tell him the thing
that you told me the other day

40:10.449 --> 40:11.659
about your mother.

40:13.953 --> 40:15.162
My mother.

40:18.290 --> 40:20.668
Well, you see, Bill,

40:20.751 --> 40:24.922
even as a child,
I had kind of a rich fantasy life.

40:25.840 --> 40:30.094
As a teenager,
I began by cutting up inanimate objects.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.304
G.I. Joe. My sister's dolls.

40:32.388 --> 40:35.266
Ripping their heads off,
cutting up the bodies.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.768
Mutilating them, if you will.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.604
You had fantasies of what, real women?

40:40.688 --> 40:41.730
[Ed] Oh, yeah.

40:41.814 --> 40:45.860
And my mother would yell
and scream at me, tell me I was sick.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.946
She thought I was going to do
something hideous one day.

40:49.029 --> 40:50.656
What did she think you were gonna do?

40:50.739 --> 40:54.160
I guess rape my sister or something.

40:54.618 --> 40:56.871
This is when I was ten years old.

40:58.122 --> 40:58.956
Nice.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.417
Not exactly  The Brady Bunch.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.127
[Tench] Why do you think she thought this?

41:03.210 --> 41:05.045
Because she was fucking nuts.

41:05.129 --> 41:07.840
-You didn't do anything to frighten her?
-[Ed] She frightened me.

41:08.424 --> 41:12.094
She'd make me sleep
on a dirty old mattress in the basement.

41:12.178 --> 41:14.889
Lock the door. Ten years old.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.433
So then it became dogs and cats,
strangling them,

41:17.516 --> 41:19.894
burying them in the backyard.

41:19.977 --> 41:21.896
[Holden] Hold on. Sorry.

41:25.232 --> 41:26.567
Just to vent.

41:27.735 --> 41:31.405
You know what I'm saying?
Classic displacement activity.

41:31.489 --> 41:35.784
Because it was my retreat
from the insanity of the world.

41:35.868 --> 41:37.953
-Then, you see--
-[Holden] Sorry. Wait a minute.

41:38.037 --> 41:39.038
Sorry, guys.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.294
Is that why your mother sent you away?

41:46.545 --> 41:49.173
In the end,
I ran away to live with my father,

41:49.256 --> 41:51.050
but he didn't want me either.

41:51.133 --> 41:54.595
So they packed me off
to live with my grandma.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.555
She thought I was a freak.

41:56.639 --> 41:57.890
Is that why you shot her?

41:58.432 --> 42:02.186
Well, they were both very controlling,
aggressive, matriarchal women.

42:02.269 --> 42:04.688
-Matriarchal?
-[Ed] Female-centric.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.732
Get that down. That's a big antecedent.

42:07.233 --> 42:08.275
What happened after that?

42:09.151 --> 42:11.362
I was put in a fucking mental institution.

42:11.987 --> 42:13.072
I was 15.

42:13.155 --> 42:15.991
I was 21 years old when I came out.

42:16.075 --> 42:19.912
All those years when other kids
were having their sexual revolution,

42:19.995 --> 42:21.747
I was locked in a room.

42:22.373 --> 42:26.919
You remember the whole flower power,
college girls into love and peace?

42:28.337 --> 42:33.050
Physically, I wasn't impotent,
but emotionally I was.

42:34.468 --> 42:39.056
Because of the way I was conditioned
by Mom, right? Like you said.

42:39.139 --> 42:40.891
-Conditioned?
-Right.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.394
You see, Bill,

42:44.019 --> 42:47.231
I knew a week before she died
I was gonna kill her.

42:49.900 --> 42:54.738
She went out to a party, she got soused,
she came home alone.

42:54.822 --> 42:58.158
I asked her how her evening went.
She just looked at me.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.662
She said, "For seven years."

43:02.288 --> 43:07.167
She said, "I haven't had sex with a man
because of you, my murderous son."

43:12.464 --> 43:15.426
So I got a claw hammer
and I beat her to death.

43:17.177 --> 43:18.512
Then I cut her head off.

43:23.475 --> 43:25.352
And I humiliated her.

43:29.898 --> 43:32.651
And I said, "There. Now you've had sex."

43:37.740 --> 43:40.200
If there's one thing I know, it's this:

43:41.910 --> 43:44.788
A mother should not scorn her own son.

43:45.956 --> 43:48.083
If a woman humiliates her little boy,

43:48.167 --> 43:52.588
he will become hostile, and violent,
and debased. Period.

44:03.182 --> 44:07.019
[man over PA]  Ladies and gentlemen,
we've reached our cruising altitude...

44:07.102 --> 44:09.647
-I think we need to talk.
-Now do you see?

44:09.730 --> 44:11.940
I need to speak to Shepard.
Tell him what's going on.

44:12.024 --> 44:12.941
It's too early.

44:13.025 --> 44:15.027
The longer we wait,
the worse it's gonna be.

44:15.110 --> 44:18.113
-We'll be drowned in red tape.
-And there's a reason for that.

44:18.197 --> 44:21.367
The FBI is a glacial bureaucracy,
but it's highly effective.

44:21.450 --> 44:23.911
Kemper's in lockdown,
what's he gonna do?

44:23.994 --> 44:26.246
Kemper is a gigantic blabbermouth.

44:26.330 --> 44:28.123
He's friends with all the prison guards.

44:28.207 --> 44:31.377
A federal agent is meeting with him,
you think that hasn't reached the warden?

44:32.920 --> 44:35.339
A couple of months, that's all I need.

44:35.422 --> 44:37.716
No. Because if we get censured,

44:37.800 --> 44:40.469
we're off work two weeks minimum,
no appeal.

44:40.552 --> 44:42.930
And you can kiss goodbye
to the Gonzales case.

44:43.013 --> 44:44.640
They'll never catch that guy.

44:50.312 --> 44:52.856
Did you tell a detective in Sacramento
you would intercede

44:52.940 --> 44:55.651
with the district attorney
on behalf of the FBI?

44:56.235 --> 44:59.279
Some DA called me and asked
why I had two agents in Sacramento.

44:59.363 --> 45:01.573
"Two goons," his exact words.

45:01.657 --> 45:02.908
It's a strange case.

45:02.991 --> 45:05.702
The locals were struggling.
We were trying to figure a way forward.

45:05.786 --> 45:07.246
What were you thinking?

45:07.329 --> 45:09.164
At the time, we deemed this
of great urgency.

45:09.248 --> 45:10.582
The circumstances were unusual.

45:10.666 --> 45:13.585
Assault and battery?
Since when does the FBI consult on that?

45:13.669 --> 45:14.711
Not even homicide.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.130
Unless you count a dog.

45:16.672 --> 45:18.757
Bill, the past three years
I've heard you complain

45:18.841 --> 45:20.634
about how overworked you are
with the Road School.

45:20.717 --> 45:21.927
I gave you your assistant,

45:22.010 --> 45:24.304
and this is how you choose
to spend your time?

45:25.681 --> 45:28.225
I trust you understand my position
on this.

45:29.852 --> 45:32.396
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

45:35.441 --> 45:37.484
[grunts]

45:39.653 --> 45:41.363
[siren wailing on TV]

45:41.447 --> 45:44.533
I get back on Tuesday, if you want
to pick me up from the airport.

45:44.616 --> 45:45.742
Sure, I'd love to.

45:46.743 --> 45:49.580
-You should come with me sometime.
-To Detroit?

45:50.497 --> 45:53.333
See your old stomping grounds.
Meet my mom.

45:53.417 --> 45:55.002
-[laughs]
-[scoffs]

45:55.085 --> 45:56.420
Okay, good to know where we're at.

45:56.503 --> 45:59.506
-No, I would love to meet your mom.
-I said sometime.

45:59.590 --> 46:01.758
No, actually, it's something
I would really enjoy.

46:01.842 --> 46:03.427
I meant eventually.

46:03.510 --> 46:05.846
I'm sure she's really, really lovely.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.557
Actually, she's kind of a bitch,

46:09.433 --> 46:11.310
especially when it comes
to people I'm dating.

46:11.393 --> 46:12.227
Really?

46:12.936 --> 46:14.855
But... I like you.

46:15.939 --> 46:18.358
I might give you the secret
to win her over.

46:20.527 --> 46:21.528
What might that be?

46:21.612 --> 46:25.282
Well, Mom doesn't care what kind of music
you like, what kind of job you have,

46:25.365 --> 46:26.950
what kind of car you drive.

46:27.576 --> 46:30.954
Instead, she'll ask you about your mother.

46:31.580 --> 46:34.041
It'll seem like
a perfectly innocent question,

46:34.124 --> 46:36.210
but she'll be watching you closely.

46:37.211 --> 46:39.880
If she thinks
you love and respect your mom,

46:40.547 --> 46:43.258
she'll know that you'll treat her daughter
the same way.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.387
That's actually shrewd.

46:48.055 --> 46:50.724
...hair group.
It can't do anything about the hair...

46:50.807 --> 46:51.934
So...

46:53.018 --> 46:54.269
do you like your mom?

46:54.770 --> 46:56.730
[inhales, exhales]

46:56.813 --> 46:57.856
I do.

46:57.940 --> 47:00.400
She's someone I really enjoy talking to.

47:00.984 --> 47:03.862
I knew it. I knew you were a momma's boy.

47:06.240 --> 47:09.368
You should just come with me tomorrow.
You've already passed the test.

47:09.826 --> 47:11.495
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

47:12.079 --> 47:14.164
Shepard doesn't want us leaving town.

47:14.248 --> 47:15.666
Why? What's happened?

47:16.166 --> 47:17.459
We-- Well...

47:18.085 --> 47:19.002
I...

47:19.753 --> 47:21.255
really fucked up.

47:21.839 --> 47:23.632
Ooh. You grounded?

47:28.095 --> 47:30.806
When are they gonna start
taking this whole thing seriously?

47:30.889 --> 47:31.723
[sighs]

48:00.752 --> 48:02.421
-Hi.
-Hi.

48:12.014 --> 48:15.517
-How do you know where I live?
-Personnel gave me your address.

48:25.902 --> 48:27.154
Let's go back to Shepard.

48:27.863 --> 48:29.948
Tell him about Kemper,
tell him what we've been doing.

48:30.032 --> 48:32.743
-You think he'll listen now?
-Let's make it official.

48:32.826 --> 48:35.078
You don't want to wait
till Sacramento blows over?

48:35.162 --> 48:37.664
No, I want to go back to Sacramento
and fix it.

48:38.040 --> 48:40.542
If we fix it,
Shepard might give us what we want.

48:42.210 --> 48:44.671
He's not stupid. He'll have to listen.

48:44.755 --> 48:47.049
[Shepard]
Are you out of your fucking minds?!

48:47.132 --> 48:48.842
You interviewed Edmund Kemper?

48:48.925 --> 48:51.011
Not so much interviewed.
More like a conversation.

48:51.094 --> 48:53.889
He said interesting things
that turned out to be really useful.

48:53.972 --> 48:55.724
-What the fuck?
-I just had this idea--

48:55.807 --> 48:58.060
I don't want to hear your idea.
I'm sick of your ideas.

48:58.143 --> 49:00.687
It is not our job
to commiserate with these people.

49:00.771 --> 49:03.607
It is our job to electrocute them.
How long has this been going on?

49:03.690 --> 49:07.319
-Just when we were in Sacramento.
-The conversations with Kemper shed light

49:07.402 --> 49:09.071
on things we've been exploring
in the unit.

49:09.154 --> 49:11.573
There's a correlation
with what we're finding at crime scenes.

49:11.657 --> 49:12.908
It proves that we're on track.

49:12.991 --> 49:16.411
Proof the Federal Bureau of Investigation
is on track after all these years?

49:16.495 --> 49:19.081
Well, golly, what a relief.
I am so pleased for us.

49:19.164 --> 49:21.291
-We're pleased too.
-Don't smart-mouth me, Holden!

49:21.375 --> 49:24.461
You fucked up the Gonzales situation,
pissed off the Sacramento DA,

49:24.544 --> 49:27.214
and you've been interviewing lifers
in the state penitentiary.

49:27.297 --> 49:30.509
Sir, the insights during these visits
may help us identify

49:30.592 --> 49:33.345
the person responsible for the attacks
in Sacramento and prevent others.

49:33.428 --> 49:36.056
Wrong, wrong, and wrong.
Here's what it is. Burn your notes.

49:36.139 --> 49:39.393
Don't speak to me about this anymore.
Don't put it in any reports. You're done.

49:39.476 --> 49:40.519
Excuse me, sir.

49:41.728 --> 49:44.564
I truly believe there is a vein here
that needs to be mined.

49:44.648 --> 49:47.234
Okay, kiddo.
You're looking down the barrel.

49:47.734 --> 49:50.612
Three whole bags:
censure, suspension, transfer.

50:05.711 --> 50:06.753
Pardon me.

50:08.296 --> 50:11.383
Sir, permit me to speak.
I've been doing this shit for seven years.

50:11.466 --> 50:13.885
I trained Holden because
he was transferred to my department.

50:13.969 --> 50:15.762
He knows his criminal psychology.

50:15.846 --> 50:17.973
He's done his homework,
worked his butt off,

50:18.056 --> 50:19.474
and now I think he's onto something.

50:19.558 --> 50:21.727
Onto what?
He made friends with the Coed Killer.

50:21.810 --> 50:24.271
If this is going to work,
we need to talk to more subjects.

50:24.354 --> 50:27.232
More? No! What's next, Charles Manson?
When's he booked for?

50:27.315 --> 50:28.942
We were thinking June.

50:29.651 --> 50:30.736
I think it's right.

Resource, my ass!
What's the matter, bored with golf?

50:34.865 --> 50:37.534
California jails are full
of thrill killers and lust murderers.

50:37.617 --> 50:40.537
-And we put them there, that's our job.
-Dying and rotting on the vine.

50:40.620 --> 50:43.123
Cry me a river, Holden.
All the wasted potential.

50:43.206 --> 50:44.332
It is wasted potential, sir.

50:44.416 --> 50:46.501
-We could be using these people.
-Using how?

50:46.585 --> 50:48.712
-Their knowledge and insight.
-Of what?

50:48.795 --> 50:49.921
-[Holden] Themselves.
-Whoselves?!

50:50.005 --> 50:52.466
Then we know what we're talking about
when we speak to other law enforcement.

50:52.549 --> 50:55.260
-Can you make him shut up?
-I have not been able to, sir.

50:56.845 --> 51:00.474
How do we get ahead of crazy
if we don't know how crazy thinks?

51:10.442 --> 51:11.902
I like you, Bill.

51:12.527 --> 51:14.988
I don't particularly like him,
but I like you.

51:17.783 --> 51:20.243
Okay, you may continue
with your little sideshow.

51:20.327 --> 51:22.370
However, no one can know about it. Clear?

51:23.205 --> 51:24.456
You will relocate yourselves

51:24.539 --> 51:27.000
to the basement
beneath Behavioral Sciences,

51:27.083 --> 51:29.211
reporting directly and exclusively to me.

51:29.294 --> 51:30.921
The basement? I'm 44 years old.

51:31.004 --> 51:34.257
You may dedicate ten hours
of your 50-hour work week to this.

51:34.341 --> 51:37.844
If I deem any aspect of it to be
unwarranted, unnecessary, or unsavory,

51:37.928 --> 51:40.096
I will end it. Do you both understand?

51:40.180 --> 51:41.097
Yes.

51:42.265 --> 51:43.183
And thank you, sir.

51:44.017 --> 51:45.143
Thank you, sir.
