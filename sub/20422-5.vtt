00:00.000 --> 00:03.480
<b>Serial Killer!! in Akihabara?</b>

00:02.340 --> 00:05.520
That serial killer showed up again?

00:05.520 --> 00:08.240
We don't die, so it's kind of hard to understand.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.570
But that makes it even scarier.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.420
How many victims have there been?

00:13.420 --> 00:16.490
I wish they wouldn't do it at a time like this.

00:16.490 --> 00:20.330
It's hurting our sales, and ruining our Christmas.

00:20.680 --> 00:24.270
But why doesn't the Royal Guard show up?

00:24.270 --> 00:25.330
Now that you mention it...

00:27.300 --> 00:31.840
<i>The Royal Guard is a security system 
from when this world was a game.</i>

00:32.840 --> 00:36.560
<i>They immediately detect any violent acts 
committed within no-combat zones,</i>

00:36.560 --> 00:38.680
<i>and teleport in to neutralize the situation.</i>

00:39.650 --> 00:44.730
<i>They have equipment called "movable armor" 
that allows them to use external magic</i>

00:44.730 --> 00:48.330
<i>to greatly increase their physical abilities.</i>

00:49.520 --> 00:52.930
<i>This gives the Royal Guard,</i>

00:52.930 --> 00:55.990
<i>who are People of the Land, 
power that exceeds that of adventurers,</i>

00:55.990 --> 00:58.450
<i>allowing them to keep the city safe.</i>

02:32.370 --> 02:33.980
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, huh?

02:33.980 --> 02:35.710
And look what we're doing.

02:35.710 --> 02:37.170
It can't be helped.

02:37.780 --> 02:39.650
No sign of anything so far.

02:39.650 --> 02:41.320
Moving to the next block.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.460
When you go looking for them, 
they don't show up.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.370
This isn't even a quest.

02:45.370 --> 02:47.520
And it's kind of cold.

02:48.970 --> 02:49.980
That's him!

02:49.980 --> 02:51.070
Where did he come from?

02:51.070 --> 02:53.440
Status! Identify him first!

02:54.090 --> 02:55.310
What the hell?

02:56.100 --> 02:57.240
He's—

02:57.940 --> 03:03.740
<b>Christmas Eve</b>

03:01.540 --> 03:03.000
Christmas Eve.

03:03.930 --> 03:08.120
<b>It's Christmas Eve</b>

03:06.850 --> 03:08.120
Wiped out?

03:08.560 --> 03:13.630
Yes. They were some of 
my guild's best adventurers.

03:13.790 --> 03:16.840
That puts the death count over ten.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.260
His name is Embert Nelreth.

03:19.260 --> 03:21.630
No guild affiliation, samurai class,

03:21.990 --> 03:23.530
level 94.

03:24.140 --> 03:26.280
That's all the information we have.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.930
No, the bigger problem is that we know 
this much and still can't do anything.

03:30.930 --> 03:31.650
Yeah.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.470
And even if he killed us, that wouldn't be the end.

03:35.470 --> 03:37.030
Not for us adventurers.

03:37.030 --> 03:40.650
Part of me thinks we aren't worried enough, 
but that's better than panic.

03:40.960 --> 03:46.330
But if we can't solve this soon, 
I don't think that will last.

03:46.330 --> 03:49.910
Evacuation is one possibility, I think.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.260
Abandon Akihabara?

03:52.260 --> 03:54.370
Only as an emergency measure.

03:54.370 --> 03:56.420
We could move to Shibuya temporarily.

03:56.420 --> 03:58.200
You're being too dramatic.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.970
And anyway, that's not something those of us

04:00.970 --> 04:03.180
in this room can decide on our own.

04:04.400 --> 04:09.700
Still, maybe we should at least 
evacuate the lower-leveled kids?

04:09.700 --> 04:11.810
That's worth discussing.

04:12.190 --> 04:15.440
But still, serial killings in Akihabara?

04:15.930 --> 04:18.510
We need to think of some way to stop it.

04:19.230 --> 04:20.440
Yes.

04:20.750 --> 04:24.120
By the way, what's the villain in glasses doing?

04:24.120 --> 04:27.280
He keeps missing the conferences 
that he initiated himself.

04:27.670 --> 04:30.450
Well, he's, um... You know...

04:30.880 --> 04:33.980
He's out and about, trying to deal 
with our financial problems.

04:33.980 --> 04:38.630
You know, it's December, and the 
Christmas event is tomorrow.

04:40.890 --> 04:42.260
Zantleaf?

04:42.560 --> 04:43.700
Yep.

04:43.700 --> 04:50.070
Anyone below level 50 is being asked 
to help take out the goblins.

04:50.070 --> 04:53.520
Isn't that just an excuse to get 
us away from the serial killer?

04:53.870 --> 04:57.520
Well, that's at the heart of it, I'd imagine.

04:57.770 --> 05:00.480
I don't want special treatment, Chief!

05:00.480 --> 05:01.510
We can also—

05:01.510 --> 05:02.550
Tohya!

05:02.550 --> 05:05.150
Do you want to defeat the murderer?

05:05.150 --> 05:06.530
Of course!

05:06.890 --> 05:09.050
You might die.

05:09.050 --> 05:10.660
I'm prepared for that.

05:11.790 --> 05:14.660
Because you'll come back to life?

05:15.090 --> 05:18.440
N-No, that's not it...

05:18.810 --> 05:20.170
Tohya?

05:20.680 --> 05:21.940
I...

05:21.940 --> 05:26.030
Is that how a front-line fighter should think?

05:26.030 --> 05:27.540
O-Oh...

05:27.810 --> 05:28.910
That's right.

05:28.910 --> 05:32.760
If I rush in and die, the party 
won't be able to function.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.810
Not only that.

05:35.170 --> 05:37.050
Just the fact that you revive

05:37.050 --> 05:40.820
means that, essentially, you're 
getting special treatment.

05:41.170 --> 05:45.930
By getting used to that, 
thinking of it as normal...

05:46.680 --> 05:50.630
It seems to me that you lose 
something in exchange.

05:55.450 --> 05:59.010
<i>Akatsuki didn't come home again today.</i>

06:00.000 --> 06:02.630
It's Christmas Eve. Want to get 
something to eat somewhere?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.300
<i>Where are you,</i>

06:03.130 --> 06:04.300
I-I'll pay!

06:04.770 --> 06:09.070
Training on Christmas? You're kidding me.

06:05.340 --> 06:06.800
<i>murderer?</i>

06:09.070 --> 06:12.700
Screw that murderer. 
Where the hell is the Royal Guard?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.700
<i>They're interfering.</i>

06:12.700 --> 06:14.720
<i>All these unneeded presences...</i>

06:18.070 --> 06:22.210
<i>Would my lord be angry that I keep doing this?</i>

06:23.310 --> 06:25.740
I want you to protect Princess Lenessia.

06:26.730 --> 06:29.360
<i>What did he want me to protect her from?</i>

06:30.440 --> 06:32.740
<i>It's true that People of the Land are weak.</i>

06:33.990 --> 06:38.200
<i>But I think she has plenty of strength.</i>

06:39.930 --> 06:43.990
<i>Do I have the right to protect her?</i>

06:45.120 --> 06:47.050
<i>Or the right to say anything?</i>

06:51.670 --> 06:54.300
<i>I want to be strong...</i>

06:56.790 --> 06:58.810
The enemy is very skilled.

06:59.660 --> 07:01.690
Keep your guard up at all times.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.350
Assume that his abilities

07:04.900 --> 07:07.190
exceed your own, and even mine.

07:07.910 --> 07:11.530
Make sure you stay with your group, 
and report in constantly.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.530
Nazuna will coordinate communications at HQ.

07:14.530 --> 07:16.520
Don't try to be heroes.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.220
Even if you end up in combat with the target,

07:19.220 --> 07:21.670
use formation alpha to delay him.

07:21.670 --> 07:25.970
For this operation, we've put 
two healers in every team,

07:25.970 --> 07:27.460
so you won't have enough attack power.

07:28.110 --> 07:31.590
Your job is to delay him and contact us.

07:31.950 --> 07:32.720
Got it?

07:33.000 --> 07:33.990
Got it!

07:34.650 --> 07:36.500
Okay. All right, Souji!

07:37.720 --> 07:42.230
I think you said everything I wanted to say.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.730
Just one thing, then.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.990
The target attacked one of our own.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.440
Murder him.

08:16.990 --> 08:19.770
You can send me out already, you know?

08:20.100 --> 08:22.930
I want revenge on that murderer.

08:22.930 --> 08:25.680
You just died and came back to life.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.170
Rest for a bit.

08:27.170 --> 08:30.550
But Sou's out there fighting for me...

08:30.550 --> 08:32.780
It isn't for you.

08:33.450 --> 08:38.280
No matter which of us had been attacked, 
he'd never forgive the murderer.

08:39.160 --> 08:40.790
That's how he is.

08:41.340 --> 08:43.220
I understand that.

08:43.220 --> 08:46.070
He's nice to every girl...

08:48.360 --> 08:51.550
But let me dream, at least.

08:52.400 --> 08:56.800
Anyway, you're amazing, putting 
Christmas and pork soup together.

08:57.810 --> 08:59.310
I put in salmon, too.

08:59.820 --> 09:02.540
<i>It's true that Souji's nice.</i>

09:03.110 --> 09:06.190
<i>But not because he's simply a good person.</i>

09:06.550 --> 09:10.320
<i>It's just the kind of boy he is.</i>

09:10.920 --> 09:14.820
<i>That's why, once he gets mad, 
there's no telling what he'll do.</i>

09:15.270 --> 09:18.780
<i>There's a fine line between his kindness 
and that terrifying side of him.</i>

09:21.630 --> 09:24.330
<i>If those two were here...</i>

09:24.780 --> 09:28.570
<i>The only ones who could talk him 
out of it, or affect him at all,</i>

09:28.570 --> 09:31.030
<i>are Kazuhiko and Shiroe.</i>

09:31.920 --> 09:33.340
Really, I'm sorry.

09:34.510 --> 09:37.210
Yeah, I'll be back by New Year's,

09:37.210 --> 09:38.930
I think. Yeah.

09:38.930 --> 09:39.960
I see.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.440
You still can't find the murderer?

09:42.970 --> 09:44.350
Are you continuing patrols?

09:44.550 --> 09:45.740
Yes.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.480
Don't worry about that.

09:48.930 --> 09:50.080
Oh, right...

09:50.080 --> 09:51.980
Akatsuki's working hard, as well.

09:53.090 --> 09:54.990
Yes, that's right.

09:56.350 --> 09:59.720
Yes. You be careful, too, Shiro.

10:00.810 --> 10:01.870
Souji!

10:03.420 --> 10:05.200
Sounds like he's appeared.

10:07.430 --> 10:09.270
I'll order the search team to retreat.

10:09.270 --> 10:12.920
We, in the main unit, 
will surround and obliterate him!

10:15.870 --> 10:18.930
It's been a long time, Princess Lenessia.

10:21.650 --> 10:24.220
<i>Kinjou, with the Kunie Clan.</i>

10:24.220 --> 10:26.430
<i>What brings him here unannounced, and so late?</i>

10:27.190 --> 10:30.910
I'm sorry to visit you so suddenly, 
at this hour of the night.

10:31.370 --> 10:33.350
A serious matter has come up,

10:33.350 --> 10:37.450
and I've come to explain and apologize.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.950
What is it?

10:41.370 --> 10:44.450
You are familiar with the Defenders, yes?

10:44.840 --> 10:49.950
It seems the adventurers prefer 
to call them the Royal Guard.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.080
Yes.

10:51.080 --> 10:54.460
Naturally, I know they're a critical 
part of the city's security.

10:55.530 --> 11:00.050
A set of movable armor was stolen 
from one of their guardhouses.

11:01.800 --> 11:04.210
We believe one of the Royal Guard stole it,

11:05.070 --> 11:08.020
a member of the Kunie Clan.

11:18.550 --> 11:20.570
A Defender's movable armor

11:20.570 --> 11:25.990
must receive a supply of magic at all times 
from a massive magic circle under the city.

11:26.390 --> 11:29.000
Each city's is slightly different.

11:29.410 --> 11:33.220
Doesn't that mean there's no point 
in taking it outside the town?

11:33.220 --> 11:37.130
But it also means that, inside the 
town, its power is unmatched.

11:37.520 --> 11:41.340
It exceeds that of an adventurer.

11:42.930 --> 11:44.640
Then the murderer...

11:45.250 --> 11:46.150
Yes.

11:46.670 --> 11:50.140
The Kunie Clan is involved in that crime.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.750
It's embarrassing, but I can say this with certainty.

11:54.390 --> 11:58.850
<i>That means one of the People of 
the Land killed an adventurer.</i>

12:00.070 --> 12:02.380
This affair is our fault.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.660
I am truly sorry.

12:07.580 --> 12:08.970
Is there...

12:10.100 --> 12:15.730
I mean, is there anything the Kunie Clan can do?

12:16.840 --> 12:19.920
I'm sorry, Princess Lenessia.

12:20.330 --> 12:23.630
Of course, if we shut off the magic supply,

12:23.630 --> 12:26.170
the movable armor would cease to function.

12:26.170 --> 12:30.540
But at the same time, it would 
disable the city's magic defenses,

12:30.540 --> 12:33.030
allowing monsters to enter the city.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.620
C-Can't you reboot it?

12:35.620 --> 12:38.690
You can't just turn it back on?

12:39.490 --> 12:43.640
All I can say is that it would take decades.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.480
<i>I wish I hadn't heard that.</i>

12:52.080 --> 12:54.130
<i>But I did.</i>

12:55.740 --> 12:58.590
<i>But what can I do about it?</i>

13:01.760 --> 13:03.800
I want you to protect Princess Lenessia.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.350
It's over...

13:10.080 --> 13:11.860
It's over for sure.

13:11.860 --> 13:13.860
Why now?

13:13.860 --> 13:15.980
Why me?

13:15.980 --> 13:19.620
Why, when I came here, of all times?

13:20.560 --> 13:23.110
Isn't there anything you can do?

13:23.110 --> 13:25.430
Can't you get me out of this?

13:25.430 --> 13:27.870
Can't you go easy on me?

13:28.530 --> 13:30.930
What should I do?

13:31.330 --> 13:33.310
Talk to the Round Table.

13:33.310 --> 13:39.850
But if I do that, won't it mean 
fighting the adventurers?

13:39.850 --> 13:42.290
But you can't keep it a secret.

13:42.890 --> 13:46.200
I have to tell them, don't I?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.200
I don't know that.

13:48.610 --> 13:52.270
Why isn't that monster here when I need him?

13:52.830 --> 13:56.770
When I didn't need him, he was always around.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.270
Crusty went to Seventh Fall.

14:00.630 --> 14:02.170
I'm aware.

14:02.170 --> 14:03.710
But even so...

14:04.950 --> 14:06.280
That's not it.

14:11.340 --> 14:12.970
That's not it!

14:16.100 --> 14:16.770
Huh?

14:17.710 --> 14:18.340
Huh?

14:19.730 --> 14:21.030
Um...

14:21.030 --> 14:23.730
I'm sorry for entering without permission.

14:24.570 --> 14:27.230
Did you... hear all that?

14:27.230 --> 14:27.880
Yes.

14:30.030 --> 14:31.390
Of course you did...

14:37.890 --> 14:41.270
<b>Red Bean Bun</b>

14:40.350 --> 14:41.270
How about it?

14:46.770 --> 14:48.530
It's sweet...

14:48.890 --> 14:51.340
Sweet things make me feel better.

14:51.340 --> 14:52.280
Yes.

14:52.510 --> 14:56.090
But the rest of the world isn't so easy.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.540
Yeah.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.350
The killer is a Person of the Land?

15:03.750 --> 15:05.030
Yes, that's right.

15:05.500 --> 15:09.300
I'm really sorry...

15:11.120 --> 15:12.060
Why?

15:13.130 --> 15:14.730
Why was it stolen?

15:14.730 --> 15:15.780
Who stole it?

15:16.170 --> 15:20.060
They don't know what he wants or where he is.

15:23.060 --> 15:25.610
I think he's hiding in the sewers.

15:27.070 --> 15:31.250
If we assume he won't leave the city 
because he'd lose his combat powers,

15:31.250 --> 15:33.070
that limits the places he can hide.

15:34.340 --> 15:36.170
The only place that hasn't been searched,

15:36.170 --> 15:39.210
where people wouldn't see him, is the sewers.

15:39.210 --> 15:42.080
Does that mean we can catch him?

15:42.360 --> 15:45.900
No, the Royal Guard can teleport.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.830
So even if we surrounded him, he could escape.

15:48.370 --> 15:49.730
Oh...

15:52.730 --> 15:57.170
<i>She bears such a heavy burden 
on her tiny shoulders.</i>

15:57.880 --> 15:59.700
<i>But she was doing her best</i>

16:00.440 --> 16:01.870
<i>with those tiny shoulders.</i>

16:05.710 --> 16:06.760
This is upsetting you?

16:07.360 --> 16:08.800
It is.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.470
I'll find him.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.000
I'll do my job.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.750
Because I've seen you doing your best.

16:28.170 --> 16:29.430
Tanks, switch!

16:29.430 --> 16:31.100
Naotsugu, draw aggro!

16:31.100 --> 16:32.340
Leave it to me!

16:32.910 --> 16:35.710
Look over here, big guy!

16:56.320 --> 16:57.650
Commander!

16:57.650 --> 16:59.120
Get back, Isami!

16:59.430 --> 17:01.320
Hey, hang in there.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.710
Something about him isn't right.

17:03.710 --> 17:07.380
We hit him a bunch of times, 
but his HP hasn't gone down at all.

17:07.380 --> 17:09.690
And his status display looks weird.

17:07.380 --> 17:09.730
<b>Embert Nelreth/ Samurai, Lv. 94</b>

17:09.690 --> 17:14.990
And we've been fighting so boldly, 
but the Royal Guard still isn't coming.

17:15.610 --> 17:18.230
Without the commander's support, 
we would've been in danger.

17:18.550 --> 17:19.860
We have to help, too!

17:19.860 --> 17:20.770
You can't.

17:20.770 --> 17:23.770
In a narrow alley like this, 
you'll just get in the way.

17:24.110 --> 17:25.900
Leave the rest to Souji.

17:26.230 --> 17:28.910
He's like a beast!

17:31.560 --> 17:34.910
Is he really a samurai, like Sou?

17:35.550 --> 17:36.930
Divine Eye...

17:38.120 --> 17:40.740
Souji's Teaching. A defensive ability.

17:41.170 --> 17:45.040
Sou said it allows you to see 
the trails that form in the air.

17:47.070 --> 17:49.320
But he isn't getting a chance to use it.

17:50.280 --> 17:54.550
Normally, he'd deflect or dodge, 
instead of blocking with his blade.

17:55.120 --> 17:55.930
Master...

17:58.620 --> 17:59.430
Commander!

17:58.950 --> 18:00.050
Master!

18:00.050 --> 18:01.190
Sou!

18:01.970 --> 18:04.770
<i>The barrier I put on Souji is gone...</i>

18:04.770 --> 18:07.260
<i>That should have protected 
twenty percent of his HP.</i>

18:07.260 --> 18:10.070
<i>At this rate, he won't last long.</i>

18:10.800 --> 18:12.690
<i>He needs to think about retreating.</i>

18:12.690 --> 18:13.690
<i>But...</i>

18:14.440 --> 18:19.570
<i>If he does, that guy will just turn 
around and attack everyone else.</i>

18:20.240 --> 18:23.580
<i>There's no guarantee that 
Souji can stop him alone.</i>

18:26.620 --> 18:29.390
What should we do for business after Christmas?

18:29.720 --> 18:31.440
You're changing job classes again?

18:31.440 --> 18:34.270
Wow, it's beautiful! This is for me?

18:33.010 --> 18:35.660
Christmas is that thing the adventurers 
are all excited about, right?

18:34.270 --> 18:35.660
Merry Christmas.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.540
What is it, anyway? Does it taste good?

18:37.540 --> 18:39.090
Watch out, Souji!

18:47.360 --> 18:48.140
You're...

18:48.540 --> 18:49.730
From Shiroe's guild...

18:50.150 --> 18:51.460
<i>Axel Fang!</i>

18:52.620 --> 18:54.740
Akatsuki, right?

18:56.350 --> 18:57.400
<i>Stealth Blade!</i>

18:58.370 --> 18:59.910
<i>Quick Assault!</i>

18:59.910 --> 19:01.830
Amazing... She can also...

19:06.640 --> 19:07.830
<i>Gust Step!</i>

19:12.820 --> 19:16.210
<i>Without my barrier, that would've killed me.</i>

19:17.040 --> 19:18.220
<i>He's strong.</i>

19:18.440 --> 19:20.740
<i>And that katana...</i>

19:22.380 --> 19:23.220
Run!

19:25.300 --> 19:26.470
Why?

19:27.560 --> 19:28.980
<i>Why?</i>

19:30.480 --> 19:31.670
Why?

19:33.590 --> 19:36.480
Because defeating him and solving 
the problem are different things.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.660
<i>Assassinate!</i>

19:46.640 --> 19:49.410
<i>Right now, that's the only skill I can use.</i>

19:49.800 --> 19:51.340
I said run!

19:52.210 --> 19:54.420
I can't agree to that.

19:55.910 --> 19:57.470
Withdraw, Nazuna!

19:57.470 --> 19:58.420
Roger!

19:58.910 --> 20:01.430
I'll be waiting at the guild hall.

20:01.970 --> 20:03.600
<i>He was watching his friends?</i>

20:03.600 --> 20:05.060
<i>During a battle like this?</i>

20:05.760 --> 20:07.170
<i>To draw the enemy's attention,</i>

20:07.170 --> 20:09.430
<i>and wait for the right moment for their retreat...</i>

20:10.210 --> 20:12.120
<i>He knows he can't win,</i>

20:12.120 --> 20:13.940
<i>but for his friends...</i>

20:17.010 --> 20:18.850
It's Christmas Eve.

20:19.330 --> 20:23.950
So I have to give some kind 
of present to his protégé.

20:27.120 --> 20:31.020
Not that there's much I can say.

20:32.450 --> 20:34.560
<i>Votive Sword Kogarasumaru!</i>

20:46.090 --> 20:48.190
Watch carefully, listen carefully,

20:49.250 --> 20:50.730
wish strongly,

20:50.730 --> 20:53.020
and keep thinking about what you have to do.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.340
Continue to train, without giving up.

21:07.440 --> 21:12.510
It's pathetic how little of an explanation that is.

21:13.330 --> 21:14.520
But this is

21:16.000 --> 21:18.530
the entirety of the Teachings...

21:22.330 --> 21:23.490
Not yet...

21:25.300 --> 21:27.850
I still don't understand anything.

21:27.850 --> 21:29.990
I'm so close!

21:40.810 --> 21:43.300
This can't be real...

21:45.540 --> 21:46.410
Shiro!

21:57.060 --> 22:01.720
I'm told this is what you people say on this day...

22:02.420 --> 22:04.970
Merry Christmas.

22:11.240 --> 22:16.050
What are you doing now, my lord...

22:20.190 --> 22:22.480
I miss you...

22:25.040 --> 22:26.440
My lord...

24:05.590 --> 24:07.840
Akatsuki wanders a town of illusions.

24:07.840 --> 24:12.300
Is what she sees regret, 
or an old wound in her heart?

24:12.300 --> 24:15.660
Lost and uncertain, she flees to a moonlit beach.

24:15.660 --> 24:18.140
There, she finds a warmth she remembers,

24:18.140 --> 24:19.430
Shiroe.

24:19.430 --> 24:21.140
What will they find within themselves,

24:21.140 --> 24:23.520
when they meet in the land of the dead?

24:23.520 --> 24:25.610
Next time: A Lost Child at Dawn.

24:23.520 --> 24:29.940
<b>A Lost Child at Dawn</b>

24:25.610 --> 24:27.800
Rise up once more.
