02:34.914 --> 02:37.146
I'm built to last.

02:37.216 --> 02:39.243
I'll die...

02:39.318 --> 02:41.721
...when I damn well please.

02:54.467 --> 02:55.833
Aah!

02:55.901 --> 02:57.632
Get me
the fuck out of here.

02:57.703 --> 02:59.366
Aah.

02:59.439 --> 03:00.337
What do you know about this?!

03:00.407 --> 03:02.205
Oh, shit.

03:02.274 --> 03:03.299
What do you know?

03:03.376 --> 03:04.742
You see that?

03:04.810 --> 03:07.338
You see this crispy stump?

03:07.414 --> 03:09.714
Her arm was blown off.

03:13.252 --> 03:14.185
Fucker!

03:14.253 --> 03:16.554
You dickhead lesbo!

03:28.301 --> 03:30.464
I ain't got no notion
of what went down.

03:30.537 --> 03:32.233
I swear to God.

03:39.346 --> 03:42.785
Aah! No!

03:43.816 --> 03:44.875
You're gonna spill your guts!

03:44.950 --> 03:47.285
All right, goddamn it!
I'll tell ya!

04:07.340 --> 04:08.740
Aah!

04:09.708 --> 04:11.040
Aah!

04:12.479 --> 04:13.845
Motherfucker!

04:13.912 --> 04:15.541
I didn't do shit!

04:15.614 --> 04:16.445
Who did?

04:16.516 --> 04:18.815
It was that goddamn bastard.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.219
- Who?!
- Bozo!

04:24.023 --> 04:25.549
Bozo!

04:51.050 --> 04:53.214
His Trans-Am's gone.

04:53.286 --> 04:55.381
Son of a bitch.

04:55.455 --> 04:57.516
Which way
did the son of a bitch go?

04:57.590 --> 04:59.787
The small town down there,

04:59.858 --> 05:02.159
on the other side of the bridge.

05:02.228 --> 05:03.719
That's where he hangs out at

05:03.796 --> 05:05.698
with his gimpy brother.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.799
He left me.

05:14.474 --> 05:16.774
Those son of a bitches.

05:16.842 --> 05:17.832
They left me.

05:22.715 --> 05:24.548
They left me for dead.

05:29.255 --> 05:30.723
You have a heart attack?

05:31.857 --> 05:33.417
My heart.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.515
<i>daughter alive</i>
<i>in a drainage pipe.</i>

06:00.587 --> 06:02.682
<i>Now, some believe that Gus,</i>

06:02.755 --> 06:05.318
<i>affectionately known</i>
<i>as "Short Bus" Gus,</i>

06:05.392 --> 06:07.955
<i>possesses a special psychic gift.</i>

06:09.562 --> 06:11.691
Take me downtown, thrust bunny!

06:11.764 --> 06:14.793
Oh! Yes! Aah!

06:14.867 --> 06:16.530
Hurry the fuck up in there!

06:16.603 --> 06:19.906
We gotta pick up Grandma
before the match.

06:19.973 --> 06:22.307
<i>I could just smell her courage.</i>

06:31.117 --> 06:33.144
What the fuck is that?!

06:33.219 --> 06:34.916
Oh, my God! Run!

06:34.988 --> 06:36.183
Fuckin' tricky Mexicans.

07:04.684 --> 07:06.882
She's gone, man.

07:06.953 --> 07:07.943
She's gone.

07:34.914 --> 07:36.143
I'm Thunder.

07:36.216 --> 07:38.015
This is Lightning.

07:38.084 --> 07:39.484
I bring the rumble.

07:39.552 --> 07:41.454
He brings the pain.

07:41.521 --> 07:43.890
Not politically correct
to kill a little person,

07:43.957 --> 07:45.619
let alone two.

08:06.513 --> 08:07.982
I will.

08:20.393 --> 08:22.887
How long
you gonna hold out on me, huh?

08:22.962 --> 08:24.761
You can't hide it forever.

08:24.832 --> 08:27.200
But I can hold you forever,
should it come to that.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.173
Six days now in the clinker, huh?

08:33.239 --> 08:35.436
Well, you probably
want a shower, right?

08:36.509 --> 08:38.102
Not today, bud.

08:38.177 --> 08:40.909
No shower, no bread, no water.

08:46.085 --> 08:49.547
Your odor reminds me of the paste
my asshole makes on a hot day.

08:50.791 --> 08:53.489
Can't keep me in here like this.

08:53.561 --> 08:54.756
Who's gonna stop me?

08:54.828 --> 08:57.355
I'm an anti-smack regime
in full effect, son.

08:57.430 --> 08:59.457
I'm a guillotine lookin' for a head.

09:00.701 --> 09:01.669
Luke.

09:01.735 --> 09:02.828
Yes, sir?

09:08.642 --> 09:10.612
Now, I know you're cookin'
this crystal meth shit

09:10.678 --> 09:12.739
in your school bus somewhere.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.476
Where is it?

09:14.548 --> 09:16.073
Where'd you hide your bus this time?

09:16.149 --> 09:18.620
Where's your goddamn lair, junkie?

09:19.452 --> 09:22.983
I don't know nothin'
about no school bus, Sheriff.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.857
I'm just a vagabond.

09:27.728 --> 09:29.994
Well, that's fine...

09:31.297 --> 09:33.290
until I find it, burn it,

09:33.366 --> 09:35.029
and piss on the ashes.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.422
Don't give him anything
the rest of the day.

09:55.489 --> 09:56.548
All right, Sheriff.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.409
I'm dyin' soon,

10:17.478 --> 10:20.210
and I'm dyin' horribly.

10:25.151 --> 10:27.622
Who wants to get fingered?

11:02.256 --> 11:04.226
I'm tellin' you,
she's cheatin' on me. I know it.

11:07.761 --> 11:09.492
Dale, it's screwing with my business.

11:12.131 --> 11:14.432
Dale, I'm not even
number-one salesman

11:14.501 --> 11:16.903
at my own
two-employee-strong car lot now.

11:19.406 --> 11:20.339
All right, Dale, listen.

11:20.407 --> 11:22.434
He's someone in this fuckin' town.
I know it.

11:23.877 --> 11:25.540
No, I don't have any proof, Dale.

11:25.612 --> 11:27.103
That's where you come, Dale.

11:27.181 --> 11:28.809
Dale, you're talkin'.

11:28.882 --> 11:31.581
Shut up, Dale. Okay, listen.

11:31.652 --> 11:33.645
That's where you come in, okay?

11:35.356 --> 11:37.383
I need some hard evidence, Dale.

11:37.458 --> 11:39.758
I need some fuckin' proof. Yeah.

11:39.827 --> 11:41.922
Some soiled panties or something,
you know?

11:41.995 --> 11:44.364
Some errant pubes,
a fuckin' used condom.

11:44.431 --> 11:46.093
I don't care.
Get me some hard evidence.

11:47.234 --> 11:48.702
Hang on a minute.

11:51.271 --> 11:52.933
We're all set here.

11:53.006 --> 11:53.939
Let's go.

11:54.007 --> 11:55.704
Hey, you guys
enjoy that station wagon, okay?

11:55.776 --> 11:56.675
Hurry up.

11:56.744 --> 11:59.375
Don't forget to come back
when junior's ready to roll.

11:59.446 --> 12:00.277
All right?

12:00.347 --> 12:01.645
Hey, hey.

12:02.716 --> 12:04.208
You folks remember,

12:04.284 --> 12:05.513
I fuckin' slash prices.

12:05.586 --> 12:06.576
Remember that.

12:10.091 --> 12:11.457
<i>Hola, amigos.</i>

12:11.525 --> 12:12.618
<i>¿No credito?</i>

12:12.693 --> 12:13.956
<i>No problemo.</i>

12:14.027 --> 12:16.260
<i>I know cars. I know engines.</i>

12:16.330 --> 12:17.889
<i>American ingenuity, it's what I do.</i>

12:17.965 --> 12:19.366
<i>Slash-slash, slash-slash,</i>

12:19.433 --> 12:20.492
<i>slickety-slash.</i>

12:20.567 --> 12:22.628
<i>Like this beauty here...2,999.</i>

12:22.703 --> 12:24.935
<i>Slash! 999.</i>

12:25.005 --> 12:27.067
<i>No credit? No problem.</i>

12:29.343 --> 12:31.438
I'm so bad,
you know it's good.

12:31.512 --> 12:32.878
Suck a dick, everyone.

12:33.647 --> 12:35.139
I slash prices.

12:40.055 --> 12:41.887
It's ruining my business, Dale.

12:41.955 --> 12:44.893
My fuckin' reputation's
on the line here, Dale.

12:47.996 --> 12:48.928
Get into it, Dale.

12:48.997 --> 12:50.727
Let that son of a bitch know
he's got it comin'.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.087
Bullshit!

13:28.469 --> 13:29.904
Ooh! Sh...

13:29.971 --> 13:31.769
Ooh!

13:31.839 --> 13:33.468
Shit, there goes a lawsuit.

13:40.115 --> 13:41.674
What the... Aah!

13:41.748 --> 13:42.978
I fuckin' knew it!

13:47.387 --> 13:49.084
So fuckin' dead!

13:49.157 --> 13:51.559
You are fuckin' dead.
You just fuckin' killed yourself.

13:52.894 --> 13:54.624
You can threaten me all you want,

13:54.695 --> 13:56.130
but I'm empowered now...

13:56.197 --> 13:57.563
by the secret.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.163
I wish for good things to happen...

14:02.236 --> 14:03.670
to me.

14:09.276 --> 14:12.612
Thought becomes thing.

14:14.916 --> 14:15.941
Motherfuckin' what?

14:16.017 --> 14:17.542
And Greg is my rock.

14:17.618 --> 14:19.588
Well, now, take it easy.

14:19.653 --> 14:21.988
Let's not
get ahead of ourselves here.

14:40.541 --> 14:42.010
I'm a ne'er-do-well,

14:42.076 --> 14:44.478
and I have a moustache.

14:44.545 --> 14:46.071
This doesn't happen overnight.

14:46.147 --> 14:47.274
Mmm?

14:48.249 --> 14:49.980
Of all fuckin' people, Greg.

15:05.532 --> 15:07.001
Okay.

16:24.045 --> 16:26.072
Ain't nobody home, husky.

16:28.616 --> 16:30.745
Let's get the fuck away from here.

16:31.352 --> 16:33.049
Where does he live?

16:35.790 --> 16:37.623
Trans-Am ain't around.

16:37.692 --> 16:40.755
That tells me
you're shit out of luck, lady.

16:40.828 --> 16:42.923
You're fucking shit out of luck!

17:00.682 --> 17:03.118
The monsters didn't attack.

17:03.184 --> 17:04.277
They're gone.

17:06.387 --> 17:08.357
We can make a run for it.

17:08.424 --> 17:10.553
We ain't goin' nowhere, woman.

17:10.625 --> 17:12.093
What are you talkin' about?

17:12.160 --> 17:14.426
That jail's the only safe place
in town.

17:14.494 --> 17:15.963
We're going.

17:16.030 --> 17:18.627
Greg, the fuckin' jail
is locked down, okay,

17:18.699 --> 17:20.362
and we can't fuckin' make it.

17:20.435 --> 17:23.166
Look outside. Have you seen
the amount of blood out there, nimrod?

17:23.237 --> 17:25.263
Okay,
that's what going for it gets you.

17:27.108 --> 17:28.702
I wished for this.

17:33.081 --> 17:34.448
This is it.

17:35.716 --> 17:38.016
I wished for this, and here it is.

17:38.086 --> 17:40.249
This is not the fuckin' help.

17:40.322 --> 17:43.556
I visualized this,
and they appeared.

17:44.592 --> 17:45.753
This is proof.

17:45.827 --> 17:48.355
Sweetie, help is the U.S.
of fuckin' A. military, okay?

17:48.430 --> 17:49.557
That's a gang.

17:49.630 --> 17:51.361
They got a fuckin' hostage,
for crying out...

17:51.433 --> 17:52.628
Get down! The big guy is looking.

18:05.347 --> 18:06.940
They're leaving.

18:07.014 --> 18:08.141
We can't just let 'em leave.

18:09.318 --> 18:10.650
Yes, we can.

18:10.718 --> 18:12.118
They've got guns.

18:12.186 --> 18:14.521
Duh,
and they'll fuckin' point them at us.

18:14.589 --> 18:18.927
No, this is a time
for mankind to come together.

18:21.330 --> 18:22.525
You're wrong!

18:22.597 --> 18:23.530
Shut the...

18:23.598 --> 18:24.566
Motherfucker!

18:24.632 --> 18:26.625
Fuck you, Greg.
You gonna tell me about wrong?

18:26.701 --> 18:28.135
You wife-fucker!

18:32.241 --> 18:33.834
Get out of my way.

18:35.610 --> 18:37.341
Come on.

18:37.412 --> 18:39.439
He's probably headed for the city.

18:39.514 --> 18:41.677
I told you
where he lived, where he hung out.

18:41.749 --> 18:44.550
Now, look, you cut me loose. Please.

18:44.619 --> 18:45.780
Get comfy.

18:52.127 --> 18:54.620
Bullshit. Stupid.
Stupid, stupid.

18:54.695 --> 18:56.756
- Motherfucker!
- Fuckin' stupid!

18:59.934 --> 19:01.027
Grab him.

19:01.103 --> 19:02.867
Oh, what the fuck?

19:02.937 --> 19:04.406
Got him.

19:06.641 --> 19:09.009
This shit's on you, Greg.
Fuck that.

19:21.390 --> 19:22.517
Greg, by the way,

19:22.590 --> 19:23.785
you're so fuckin' fired.

19:24.493 --> 19:25.893
You know what?

19:25.960 --> 19:27.259
I quit.

19:30.332 --> 19:31.630
Ooh! Shit.

19:36.505 --> 19:38.134
Is this him?

19:38.207 --> 19:39.971
That ain't him.

19:40.042 --> 19:42.410
Feel free to shoot him, though.

19:42.477 --> 19:44.140
How about you, fatback?

19:45.480 --> 19:47.211
You drive a brown Trans-Am?

19:47.282 --> 19:48.944
No! No, no, no, no.

19:49.017 --> 19:50.610
I know the guy who does, though.

19:50.685 --> 19:51.948
I sold it to him myself.

19:52.020 --> 19:53.283
That ain't him, either.

19:53.355 --> 19:55.222
- That's right. Could you please...
- Shit.

19:55.290 --> 19:56.987
We hadn't even ought to be here.

19:58.826 --> 20:01.559
You and your fuckin' revenge shit

20:01.629 --> 20:03.223
are gonna get us all done in.

20:05.133 --> 20:06.726
Hey, hey.

20:06.801 --> 20:08.668
Wait a minute.

20:08.736 --> 20:10.899
Let me tell you somethin', mama.

20:10.973 --> 20:15.107
I was a fuckin' marine
in the second World War, okay?

20:15.177 --> 20:18.547
- And I got over the goddamn Krauts...
- Close the fuckin' door, please.

20:18.614 --> 20:20.777
...and I got over the goddamn Japs,

20:20.848 --> 20:23.012
so you get that stick
out of your ass,

20:23.085 --> 20:26.455
and get over this fucking
vendetta bullshit of yours,

20:26.521 --> 20:28.491
and let's get out of here.

20:28.557 --> 20:29.547
What do you say?

20:32.127 --> 20:34.290
We hadn't even ought to be here.

20:36.131 --> 20:38.624
You and your fucking revenge shit.

20:41.970 --> 20:43.632
There anybody else in here?

20:44.573 --> 20:45.802
No, not in here,

20:45.874 --> 20:47.867
so could you please close the door?

21:17.339 --> 21:18.705
Get back! Get back!

21:18.774 --> 21:20.572
Get back! Shut the fucking door!

21:26.348 --> 21:27.509
Thank you for waking them up.

21:29.918 --> 21:31.716
What have I been saying?
Shut the fucking door.

21:31.787 --> 21:35.226
Help! Help me! Please!
Open the door!

21:35.290 --> 21:36.622
Open the... Aah!

21:36.691 --> 21:39.823
Hold the door! Hold the door!

21:46.168 --> 21:47.295
Hold the door!

21:47.369 --> 21:48.359
That wall's coming down.

21:52.507 --> 21:54.033
What the fuck?

21:59.414 --> 22:02.079
Wall's coming down.
It's made out of pigeon shit.

22:06.054 --> 22:07.990
Motherfucker!

22:18.600 --> 22:20.798
Run!

22:41.356 --> 22:44.522
Aah! You asshole bitch.

22:57.272 --> 22:58.205
Where'd he go?

22:58.273 --> 22:59.206
They ain't fuckin' here.

23:12.187 --> 23:14.248
We're gonna be safe. I know it.

23:15.625 --> 23:17.355
Other way, other way, other way.

23:30.072 --> 23:33.408
This is it. This is where he lives.

23:33.476 --> 23:34.603
Lady, you know what?

23:34.677 --> 23:36.442
You're out of your fuckin' gourd.

23:37.179 --> 23:40.276
Your Trans-Am ain't here, he ain't here.

23:55.030 --> 23:56.431
You son of a bitch.

24:32.535 --> 24:34.767
Why are you stalkin'
the son of a bitch?

24:36.639 --> 24:38.700
Lose a sister...

24:38.774 --> 24:40.106
ask me again.

24:51.621 --> 24:53.420
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:01.163 --> 25:05.160
Hold it right there.

25:09.104 --> 25:11.905
Now turn it around.

25:11.973 --> 25:14.410
Turn it around.

25:14.477 --> 25:16.379
Slowly.

25:24.554 --> 25:26.319
Shit fire and save matches.

25:28.724 --> 25:30.216
This is our hiding place.

25:31.294 --> 25:34.289
You guys take your hide
up the street to the jail.

25:37.233 --> 25:39.031
That's not gonna happen.

25:44.340 --> 25:45.672
You get out.

25:45.741 --> 25:48.713
How's that revenge thing
workin' out for ya?

25:50.212 --> 25:51.942
We're not going anywhere.

26:05.894 --> 26:07.625
Dad?

26:25.681 --> 26:27.913
Aah! Aah! Aah!

26:43.900 --> 26:46.428
I'm coming out.
I'm coming out. Please don't shoot.

26:46.502 --> 26:48.597
Don't shoot. I don't have a gun.

26:48.671 --> 26:51.108
Please. Oh, God.
Don't shoot, don't shoot.

26:51.173 --> 26:52.801
I swear to God I don't have a gun.

26:52.875 --> 26:55.472
I don't know these people.
I've never seen them before in my life.

26:56.479 --> 26:58.039
I'm on my own.

27:02.818 --> 27:06.053
People think
I'm just a dumb blonde.

27:06.122 --> 27:08.854
They have no idea who I really am.

27:21.938 --> 27:23.167
She's fucking leaving.

27:27.878 --> 27:29.210
It worked!

27:35.751 --> 27:37.584
Oh, crap.

27:39.355 --> 27:41.689
You fucking chicken shit.

27:41.757 --> 27:43.283
- No, I didn't mean to...
- Damn cunt.

27:43.359 --> 27:44.691
No, please stop!

28:04.213 --> 28:05.579
No! No! No!

28:09.152 --> 28:11.988
No! No! No!
No, he's gonna kill me!

28:17.626 --> 28:19.619
You left us for dead.

28:19.695 --> 28:21.825
You fraulein twat.

28:24.367 --> 28:27.829
Get on your feet, goddamn it.

28:27.904 --> 28:28.632
Get up here!

28:28.704 --> 28:30.071
They were gonna kill me!

28:32.475 --> 28:34.001
I said I'm sorry!

28:34.077 --> 28:36.013
Right there. Right there.

28:36.079 --> 28:37.342
I said I'm sorry!

28:49.693 --> 28:50.820
No!

28:53.496 --> 28:55.933
Forgive and forget,
huh, old man?

29:25.494 --> 29:29.663
You worthless motherfuckers!

29:29.733 --> 29:33.570
You think anyone gives a shit
about any of you?!

29:33.637 --> 29:36.609
You all deserve to fucking die.

29:36.673 --> 29:38.437
You can go to hell.

29:45.347 --> 29:46.839
Where'd you get that?

29:52.221 --> 29:53.622
Where'd you get this?

29:55.692 --> 29:58.322
Oh, fuck me.

30:00.229 --> 30:02.096
And fuck you, too!

30:02.165 --> 30:03.725
Fuck yourself.

30:05.802 --> 30:07.601
Give it! Give it to me!

30:08.672 --> 30:10.904
She deserved it.

30:17.147 --> 30:18.980
It's rainin' bitches out here.

30:19.049 --> 30:20.746
Fuck you.

30:21.885 --> 30:23.012
Stop followin' me.

30:23.086 --> 30:24.349
Greg.

30:24.420 --> 30:25.855
Wait for us.

30:25.922 --> 30:27.288
- Wait.
- Shit.

30:27.356 --> 30:29.326
Get the fuck... Go back.
Go away.

30:29.391 --> 30:30.792
Wait.

30:34.197 --> 30:35.689
Oh, shit.

30:35.765 --> 30:37.233
Shit, shit, shit.

30:37.299 --> 30:38.893
Shh, shh.

30:38.969 --> 30:40.871
Slasher's Auto Barn.

30:40.937 --> 30:42.303
Hello? Who is this?

30:42.371 --> 30:45.400
<i>We're in the metal shop.</i>
<i>Just keep moving.</i>

30:46.409 --> 30:48.275
<i>I can see you, motherfucker.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

30:48.344 --> 30:49.312
All right.

30:58.088 --> 30:59.682
<i>Keep comin'. Keep comin'.</i>

30:59.756 --> 31:00.781
<i>Watch out for the crap.</i>

31:00.857 --> 31:01.790
The what?

31:01.858 --> 31:03.851
<i>The pile of shit, motherfucker!</i>

31:03.927 --> 31:06.159
Fuck! Fuck.

31:06.229 --> 31:07.994
- <i>Yo, man, look out!</i>
- What?

31:08.064 --> 31:09.123
<i>Look out!</i>

31:12.068 --> 31:15.302
- My nose.
- Where you going, cocksucker?

31:15.372 --> 31:19.038
Over there, in the fuckin' shop.

31:28.685 --> 31:29.846
Where?

31:39.095 --> 31:44.767
Monster!

31:44.834 --> 31:46.360
Shut the fuck up!

31:46.436 --> 31:47.995
- It's okay.
- Bitch.

31:48.071 --> 31:49.700
It's dead. Now come on in.

31:49.773 --> 31:51.002
Be quiet.

31:51.074 --> 31:52.839
Fuck. Fuck me.

31:52.909 --> 31:53.899
Fuck me.

32:07.590 --> 32:10.083
All right, follow me. Come on.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.025
Fuck.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.731
This is our fort.

32:13.797 --> 32:16.234
It's soundproof, so be quiet.

32:16.299 --> 32:18.394
- What the fuck is this?
- Fuckwads.

32:32.816 --> 32:34.809
Shh.

32:35.885 --> 32:37.980
Come on.
Come on, come on, man.

32:49.032 --> 32:50.899
You all kill that monster?

32:50.967 --> 32:52.197
Hell yeah.

32:52.270 --> 32:53.431
And how'd you do that?

32:53.503 --> 32:55.496
We got lucky.

32:57.275 --> 32:58.709
Yeah, yeah, come on!

32:58.775 --> 33:00.574
Come on! Bring it on, baby!

33:00.643 --> 33:01.474
Bring it on!

33:01.544 --> 33:02.876
Yeah! Come on!

33:02.946 --> 33:05.315
Take that, bitch!

33:07.151 --> 33:08.642
Thanks for letting us in.

33:08.718 --> 33:10.779
Not a problem.

33:10.854 --> 33:14.259
There's an army convoy
goin' town to town, picking up survivors.

33:14.325 --> 33:16.557
Way I see it,
we got about 15 hours.

33:16.626 --> 33:19.826
Saw it on TV last night
before the power went to shit.

33:20.930 --> 33:22.365
Phones?

33:22.433 --> 33:23.833
Sure, they're workin',

33:23.900 --> 33:25.995
except you're the only one
that's ever answered,

33:26.070 --> 33:27.663
and that fuckwad across the street.

33:27.737 --> 33:30.538
That jail is the only
real safe place in town.

33:31.775 --> 33:34.076
She's built solid.
She's made of granite.

33:34.145 --> 33:36.775
And that junkie bastard's
got it all locked up.

33:36.846 --> 33:39.079
Ain't no way we're gettin' in there.

33:53.897 --> 33:56.391
It's been goin' on and off for hours.

34:00.637 --> 34:03.507
It's over.

34:03.573 --> 34:04.666
Beat that, <i>puto.</i>

34:08.245 --> 34:09.976
Oh, stop!

34:12.083 --> 34:14.053
No more.

34:14.118 --> 34:15.518
No!

35:37.268 --> 35:39.238
Why you motherfuckers
are so relaxed?

35:39.303 --> 35:41.364
You up in here
playin' cards and shit?

35:41.438 --> 35:43.773
This town is just waitin'
for a stiff wind to blow it over.

35:43.841 --> 35:45.902
If we keep quiet we'll be all right.

35:45.976 --> 35:47.069
How's that?

35:47.144 --> 35:48.704
Monsters don't eat where they shit,

35:48.779 --> 35:50.509
and they don't hunt
what they can't hear.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.608
Till they run low on food.

35:52.683 --> 35:54.117
Then look out, brother.

35:54.185 --> 35:56.121
Who's the dickwad in the jail?

35:56.187 --> 35:57.986
That's the town meth-head.

35:58.055 --> 36:00.582
That turd you been lookin' for...

36:00.657 --> 36:03.493
the guy in the jail,

36:03.560 --> 36:05.690
that's his goddamn uncle.

36:07.097 --> 36:08.395
Give me the cell phone.

36:22.614 --> 36:26.178
Impenetrable fortress.
How can I help you?

36:26.250 --> 36:27.879
Listen, motherfucker...

36:28.620 --> 36:29.610
<i>we're down the street,</i>

36:29.687 --> 36:31.178
and we need to get in there.

36:31.255 --> 36:33.555
Now, you're gonna unlock that door,

36:33.625 --> 36:34.650
'cause we're comin'.

36:34.725 --> 36:39.257
Lady, tell me if this sounds
like I'm hangin' up.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.665
Motherfucker dies.

36:50.307 --> 36:52.368
He definitely dies.

36:54.979 --> 36:57.472
We can get in that jail.

36:58.315 --> 37:02.518
We just have to blow them doors.

37:04.421 --> 37:06.288
With what?

37:06.357 --> 37:10.422
This is a fucking metal shop, man.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.259
Gotta be something around here.

37:12.329 --> 37:17.203
Yeah, let's blow the doors off
and create a breach.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.810
That'd be real smart.

37:26.877 --> 37:29.815
We're trying to use the building
for safety, you know?

37:29.880 --> 37:31.816
What can we do?

37:31.882 --> 37:34.615
We have to think of something.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.588
Honey, we've been trying
to think of something

37:36.655 --> 37:38.180
for the last 24 hours.

37:38.255 --> 37:40.453
You name it, we've thought of it.

37:44.529 --> 37:45.997
What about makin' a key?

37:53.170 --> 37:55.573
You're the only
key-makin' wrestlers around here.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.302
Make a fuckin' key.

37:57.374 --> 37:59.071
Have you seen that?

37:59.143 --> 38:00.806
It's 100 fuckin' yards away,

38:00.878 --> 38:02.370
something the size of your asshole.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.177
How do you suppose
I'm gonna be able to see it

38:04.248 --> 38:05.717
in order to make a key?

39:10.914 --> 39:12.543
Looks like a Magnum 860...

39:13.718 --> 39:16.815
...with a one-by-one rim cylinder.

39:16.887 --> 39:18.516
Magnum eight-six-zero.

41:29.220 --> 41:32.454
All right, boys,
what can I do here?

41:32.524 --> 41:33.959
All right, look.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.188
The power comes back on,

41:36.261 --> 41:38.060
we're gonna go.

41:38.129 --> 41:40.429
- But you fuckin' watch our back!
- Got it.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.559
Amigo, it's match time.

41:42.634 --> 41:43.967
We got some lives to save,

41:44.035 --> 41:45.298
so you down for this?

41:45.370 --> 41:46.565
<i>Por Maria.</i>

41:53.678 --> 41:56.047
What the fuck are you doing?

42:02.687 --> 42:06.593
Look,
running and hiding won't last.

42:06.658 --> 42:09.755
I mean, those little midgets
might find us safety for a few days,

42:09.829 --> 42:11.958
but we need to be prepared
if it doesn't work.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.430
Oh, fuck.

42:13.498 --> 42:15.058
You're not that guy, are you?

42:15.133 --> 42:18.469
We need to know the enemy
from the inside out.

42:19.204 --> 42:23.269
We need to know
what makes this thing tick.

42:23.341 --> 42:25.675
I mean, what is it, right?

42:25.743 --> 42:26.871
Where's it from?

42:31.851 --> 42:34.617
We have to dissect it.

42:36.254 --> 42:38.554
- It's go time.
- Come on, let's go.

42:54.605 --> 42:55.904
Come on, boys. Come on.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.187
How does dissecting it
make any sense?

43:18.263 --> 43:20.700
Hey, don't worry about it.
I'm pretty sure it does.

43:32.945 --> 43:34.538
You ever seen these things fuck?

43:34.613 --> 43:36.674
I mean, it's disgusting.

43:55.233 --> 43:56.702
Oh, shit.

43:56.769 --> 43:58.431
All our questions are answered.

43:58.503 --> 44:00.439
What? What's been answered?

44:15.053 --> 44:16.750
Oh, shit.

44:27.131 --> 44:31.573
That's just the body
releasing gasses.

44:31.637 --> 44:33.732
Jesus, man.

47:29.748 --> 47:30.977
Shit.

48:13.458 --> 48:16.055
Okay, give me some light here.

48:18.398 --> 48:20.459
Bear with me, people.

48:21.667 --> 48:23.500
We're on the verge of a discovery.

48:31.044 --> 48:34.483
Shit! Shit! Shit!

48:49.828 --> 48:52.561
Oh, man, hey. Ooh, God.

48:53.099 --> 48:55.092
Come here. Can you...

48:57.170 --> 48:59.072
Hey, baby, here, here.

48:59.138 --> 49:00.663
Take my jacket. Come here.

49:00.739 --> 49:02.368
Let me just...

49:05.044 --> 49:07.207
I can't take it!

49:07.280 --> 49:09.113
- Come here, take my hand.
- I just can't.

49:09.182 --> 49:10.172
Come on, take my hand.

49:10.249 --> 49:11.740
Give me your hand.

49:13.953 --> 49:14.886
Listen to me.

49:14.954 --> 49:17.390
You gotta be strong.

49:17.457 --> 49:19.086
Be strong.

49:21.828 --> 49:22.796
Okay?

49:25.564 --> 49:29.368
Quit touching
the motherfucking organs, asshole!

49:29.435 --> 49:30.528
This is science. Shut up.

49:36.743 --> 49:37.710
Oh, fuck!

49:44.150 --> 49:44.947
Fucker!

50:23.055 --> 50:25.423
All right, all right.
I'm done. I'm done.

50:34.100 --> 50:36.093
Wait a second. Look at that.

50:36.169 --> 50:37.194
Look. Look.

50:39.572 --> 50:41.269
What the fuck is that?

50:45.845 --> 50:47.211
Is that a...

51:05.198 --> 51:07.761
- Is that cyclops lookin' at me?
- Is that a...

51:10.169 --> 51:12.606
No, I don't think...

51:12.672 --> 51:14.699
I don't think that's a...

51:58.651 --> 52:00.780
What the fuck was that?

52:15.068 --> 52:16.093
Stop it.

52:25.177 --> 52:27.910
I wish it to stop. I wish it to stop.

52:38.791 --> 52:40.624
<i>Ayúdame.</i>

52:47.033 --> 52:48.900
What the hell happened here?

52:49.369 --> 52:51.669
We were gone for,
like, two fuckin' minutes!

52:57.411 --> 52:58.970
What the fuck happened to her?!

52:59.045 --> 53:01.208
Son of a bitch right there.
He did it.

53:02.349 --> 53:04.785
Fuckin' son of a bitch!

53:04.851 --> 53:06.046
Fuckin' <i>pendejo.</i>

53:14.661 --> 53:15.890
Fuck!

53:25.104 --> 53:25.935
Aw, fuckin' A!

53:26.005 --> 53:27.338
We were supposed to be safe here.

53:27.407 --> 53:30.071
Yeah, we were,
till your queer fuckin' boyfriend

53:30.142 --> 53:31.907
fuckin' set off the monster alarm.

53:31.978 --> 53:32.741
What?

53:35.415 --> 53:36.678
Come on.

53:39.152 --> 53:40.177
Get a bag.

53:45.958 --> 53:47.655
Slide it up.

53:50.464 --> 53:52.866
Oh, shit. Come on.

53:54.634 --> 53:56.102
Get to the fuckin' roof now!

54:12.051 --> 54:13.884
Got you, motherfucker.

55:35.669 --> 55:36.933
God.

56:40.400 --> 56:42.029
Wait, where's Greg?

56:44.304 --> 56:45.294
What happened?

56:46.440 --> 56:48.707
He didn't make it.

56:48.775 --> 56:49.970
They got him.

56:52.012 --> 56:53.173
Oh.

56:53.246 --> 56:55.182
Ooh, baby, baby, come on, now.

56:57.017 --> 56:58.485
It's all right, baby.

57:03.156 --> 57:04.317
It's all right, baby.

57:06.593 --> 57:07.994
I'm still here for you.

57:09.496 --> 57:10.692
I'm still here.

57:12.466 --> 57:13.730
I'm still...

57:23.410 --> 57:24.743
What?

57:27.849 --> 57:29.408
What?

57:33.487 --> 57:34.820
It's an honest mistake.

57:39.861 --> 57:41.454
From now on,

57:41.528 --> 57:43.897
no one makes a fuckin' move
until you tell me.

57:47.167 --> 57:49.137
Get up. Come on.

58:01.415 --> 58:05.378
You boys get that key made?

58:06.687 --> 58:08.121
Yeah.

58:08.188 --> 58:10.955
Lot of fuckin' good
it does up on the roof.

58:12.292 --> 58:13.556
Fuck.

58:14.528 --> 58:17.659
Well, I guess it's back
to being fucked.

59:43.884 --> 59:45.683
I'm sorry.

59:48.623 --> 59:49.784
I'm sorry.

59:50.891 --> 59:52.952
I'm so sorry.

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:17.641
No, no, no, no!

01:01:17.812 --> 01:01:20.716
No, no, no, no!

01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:22.910
No! No!

01:01:22.984 --> 01:01:25.421
No, no, no!

01:01:25.486 --> 01:01:26.476
No!

01:02:36.757 --> 01:02:38.249
It's okay, Grandma.

01:02:40.795 --> 01:02:42.287
You look all right.

01:02:51.206 --> 01:02:55.078
Old man, you've seen this before,
haven't you?

01:02:55.143 --> 01:02:58.013
I gotta tell you little farts something.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.573
It sure as shit
ain't gonna end up well.

01:03:02.416 --> 01:03:03.611
Ah, fuck!

01:03:03.684 --> 01:03:05.085
Goddamn it.

01:03:47.261 --> 01:03:49.288
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
listen, listen, listen.

01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:50.889
There's a...

01:03:50.966 --> 01:03:53.300
There's a door on the jail roof.

01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:57.040
We can get up there,

01:03:57.105 --> 01:03:58.972
we got plenty of time
to pop the lock.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.907
How the fuck
are we gonna do that?

01:04:01.877 --> 01:04:03.813
Shh. Shh.

01:04:03.878 --> 01:04:04.846
What is that?

01:04:15.456 --> 01:04:17.050
God, that sounds like a baby.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:22.031
Oh, my God.

01:04:22.097 --> 01:04:24.431
Someone's still alive.

01:04:24.499 --> 01:04:25.968
A fuckin' baby.

01:04:26.034 --> 01:04:27.195
My God.

01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:28.430
Fuck is that coming from?

01:06:01.863 --> 01:06:03.856
What are you doing?

01:06:03.932 --> 01:06:05.697
I'm doin' the right thing.

01:06:05.767 --> 01:06:06.826
Careful, bub,

01:06:06.901 --> 01:06:10.636
heroes don't do too well
around these parts.

01:06:10.705 --> 01:06:15.511
Under the circumstances,
this might seem really, really dumb.

01:06:15.577 --> 01:06:17.273
Ya think?

01:06:17.345 --> 01:06:18.371
If it's dumb,

01:06:18.446 --> 01:06:19.914
I don't wanna be smart.

01:06:35.864 --> 01:06:37.766
This is how you save a life, people.

01:06:40.135 --> 01:06:43.005
What the... Oh, shit!

01:06:43.972 --> 01:06:46.135
Ohhhh, shit!

01:07:22.544 --> 01:07:24.012
Hey, little fella.

01:07:24.079 --> 01:07:25.946
Everything's okay now.

01:07:26.014 --> 01:07:27.745
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:07:27.815 --> 01:07:28.783
Come on, now.

01:07:29.718 --> 01:07:31.688
He's got the baby.

01:07:31.753 --> 01:07:33.552
I wished for that.

01:07:33.621 --> 01:07:36.650
Ask, believe, receive.

01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:40.925
- You can do it, honey!
- I got you.

01:07:58.747 --> 01:07:59.680
He's gonna make it.

01:08:03.985 --> 01:08:05.010
Help!

01:08:06.488 --> 01:08:07.922
Help!

01:08:07.989 --> 01:08:09.618
He's fucked.

01:08:17.698 --> 01:08:19.328
Hold on, baby.

01:08:21.337 --> 01:08:24.104
You can do it, honey!

01:08:28.344 --> 01:08:29.778
Yes!

01:08:56.071 --> 01:08:59.339
Sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

01:09:51.393 --> 01:09:52.554
Oh, my God.

01:09:54.997 --> 01:09:56.899
You piece of shit.

01:10:03.038 --> 01:10:05.372
Wow, that's bad.

01:10:05.441 --> 01:10:06.636
Even for this group.

01:10:09.578 --> 01:10:11.377
Fuck yeah, it is.

01:10:22.458 --> 01:10:24.587
Whack-a-mole! Whack-a-mole!

01:10:25.294 --> 01:10:27.730
Fuck you, bitch!
Son of a... Fuck you!

01:10:56.558 --> 01:10:58.118
Fuck you, motherfuck!

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:06.603
Fuck that! Fuck that!

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.811
Aah!

01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:23.083
Aah!

01:11:24.654 --> 01:11:28.058
We gotta get to that fucking jail,

01:11:28.123 --> 01:11:30.093
or we're all goddamn dead meat.

01:11:30.159 --> 01:11:33.188
Yeah, you got any ideas?

01:11:36.532 --> 01:11:38.058
Yeah, I got a fuckin' idea.

01:11:39.903 --> 01:11:42.066
It's gonna require a sacrifice.

01:13:30.413 --> 01:13:32.576
Hello?

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:34.843
Hello?

01:13:50.098 --> 01:13:51.294
Hello?

01:16:40.436 --> 01:16:42.372
It's gonna work.

01:16:44.707 --> 01:16:46.233
Has to.

01:16:46.309 --> 01:16:48.438
Looks dangerous.

01:16:48.511 --> 01:16:50.242
It's perfectly safe for midgets.
Let's go.

01:16:50.313 --> 01:16:51.713
That's little people, motherfucker.

01:16:51.781 --> 01:16:54.378
What the fuck ever, all right?
Come on.

01:16:54.450 --> 01:16:57.354
This thing is gonna catapult

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.185
one of these little guys
all the way over there?

01:17:01.591 --> 01:17:03.026
Yeah, that's right.

01:17:03.093 --> 01:17:05.529
That's right, and then we'll be safe
till the cavalry comes.

01:17:05.595 --> 01:17:07.497
No, fuck that. I ain't doin' that.

01:17:07.564 --> 01:17:09.056
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

01:17:09.132 --> 01:17:11.534
We just threw a woman off the ledge.

01:17:11.601 --> 01:17:13.127
These bitches are
standing here butt-naked

01:17:13.202 --> 01:17:15.104
'cause we used they clothes
to make this shit,

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:17.871
not to mention I just watched
a fuckin' baby get eaten alive,

01:17:17.941 --> 01:17:19.102
and you standin' here tellin' me

01:17:19.175 --> 01:17:21.840
that you not even willing
to give this shit a try?

01:17:25.916 --> 01:17:29.320
All right, but we testing
this motherfucker, first.

01:17:29.385 --> 01:17:31.754
Fine.

01:17:31.822 --> 01:17:33.347
Fine, grab the dead guy.

01:17:33.423 --> 01:17:34.322
We'll use him.

01:17:37.326 --> 01:17:39.558
Hey, hey, hey,
I ain't fuckin' dead.

01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:41.793
And don't touch the dick.

01:17:41.865 --> 01:17:44.301
Fine, grab the old lady.
She's practically dead, anyway.

01:17:45.368 --> 01:17:46.860
Listen to me.
You want to test it, right?

01:17:50.808 --> 01:17:51.833
Listen.

01:17:51.909 --> 01:17:53.309
Listen, listen, listen.

01:17:53.376 --> 01:17:54.936
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

01:17:55.012 --> 01:17:56.914
This is one of those
fuckin' moments, right here.

01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.973
It's a tough choice,
but it builds character, okay?

01:17:59.049 --> 01:18:01.178
<i>Que sera, que sera,</i>
I don't give a fuck. We're usin' her.

01:18:03.987 --> 01:18:04.955
No, no, no.

01:18:05.022 --> 01:18:07.288
This bitch is practically dead, anyway.

01:18:09.193 --> 01:18:12.063
Look, I don't give a fuck
what you gotta tell yourself

01:18:12.128 --> 01:18:14.325
to sleep better at night.
We're usin' her!

01:18:14.397 --> 01:18:15.558
This is happenin'.

01:18:15.631 --> 01:18:18.501
It's a tough choice.
It builds character. Let's go.

01:18:19.002 --> 01:18:20.972
She ain't comin' back, son.

01:18:21.839 --> 01:18:23.239
Look, I'm not doin' that.

01:18:23.307 --> 01:18:25.038
Sorry, pops.

01:18:25.108 --> 01:18:26.167
I can do it!

01:18:26.242 --> 01:18:28.405
I will win this!

01:18:28.478 --> 01:18:29.947
I will win!

01:18:32.816 --> 01:18:34.444
Come on, it's easy.

01:18:38.555 --> 01:18:39.717
I won!

01:18:45.528 --> 01:18:46.588
No, really, I'm okay.

01:18:57.908 --> 01:18:58.967
A'ight...

01:19:01.545 --> 01:19:02.911
but make this fast.

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:04.643
Hey.

01:19:04.715 --> 01:19:06.582
Come on. Come on.

01:19:11.421 --> 01:19:13.015
Man, if you seen what I just seen...

01:19:14.057 --> 01:19:15.822
I know, I know, I know.

01:19:16.693 --> 01:19:18.595
She's not coming back.

01:19:24.735 --> 01:19:25.964
Stop.

01:19:26.036 --> 01:19:27.562
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:19:28.337 --> 01:19:29.704
Okay.

01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:40.848
Oh, my back.

01:19:41.985 --> 01:19:43.248
Come on.

01:20:05.909 --> 01:20:07.343
Say it!

01:20:07.411 --> 01:20:10.348
Do it! Do it!

01:20:16.754 --> 01:20:19.726
I sure as shit

01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:35.405
Come on, Grandma. Let's go.

01:20:53.056 --> 01:20:57.053
All right, cinch that bag of grandma
and bring it over here.

01:22:43.401 --> 01:22:44.733
Hold on, hold on.

01:22:44.801 --> 01:22:46.703
I'm just tryin' to make sure
the weight is right.

01:22:53.611 --> 01:22:55.843
Nah, we goin' have to lose
a bit of Grandma.

01:22:57.781 --> 01:22:59.148
Come on, man. Come on.

01:23:12.796 --> 01:23:14.732
Come on, a little bit more.

01:23:14.798 --> 01:23:16.734
Come on, pour some of Grandma out.
Come on.

01:23:41.359 --> 01:23:42.919
Okay.

01:23:48.533 --> 01:23:50.594
Fly with the angels, Grandma.

01:24:08.019 --> 01:24:09.248
<i>¿Sí?</i>

01:24:29.107 --> 01:24:31.634
All right, let's give this thing a shot.

01:24:39.617 --> 01:24:40.607
Hit it.

01:24:54.165 --> 01:24:56.932
Whoo-hoo!

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:10.978
That is fuckin'
American ingenuity right there.

01:25:11.049 --> 01:25:12.449
That's what the fuck that is.

01:25:12.517 --> 01:25:13.850
I know horsepower.

01:25:13.918 --> 01:25:15.216
I know engines.

01:25:15.286 --> 01:25:17.552
It's what the fuck I <i>do,</i> okay?

01:25:17.622 --> 01:25:20.617
This is gonna be
our fuckin' salvation.

01:25:23.729 --> 01:25:27.726
Shit. That's fuckin'
factory-deal incentive right there.

01:25:29.267 --> 01:25:30.793
Mm.

01:25:30.868 --> 01:25:32.336
Ow!

01:25:32.403 --> 01:25:33.838
Whoo!

01:25:33.905 --> 01:25:36.239
All right, which one of you
fuckin' pygmies

01:25:36.307 --> 01:25:37.502
wanna be rocket man?

01:26:17.516 --> 01:26:20.078
This is fuckin' bullshit!

01:26:20.151 --> 01:26:21.141
You ready?

01:26:21.219 --> 01:26:22.688
Yeah!

01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:25.780
Hey.

01:26:27.091 --> 01:26:29.927
A coward dies a thousand deaths,

01:26:29.994 --> 01:26:32.522
but a hero dies just one.

01:26:32.598 --> 01:26:36.663
Yeah, that doesn't help,
baby-killer.
