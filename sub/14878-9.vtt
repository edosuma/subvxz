00:01.843 --> 00:03.594
Believe me. Whatever
you think you know,

00:03.596 --> 00:04.647
it is not the whole truth.

00:04.648 --> 00:06.079
Ben Mercer is a liar.

00:06.080 --> 00:08.013
Leaving you was the hardest
thing I ever had to do.

00:08.015 --> 00:09.449
I was in love with you.

00:09.450 --> 00:11.818
And you skipped out with a note.

00:11.818 --> 00:13.152
It's bad enough you
put Annie in the field

00:13.153 --> 00:14.220
to draw out Ben Mercer.

00:14.221 --> 00:15.288
That's not it at all.

00:15.289 --> 00:18.157
The agency is using
you to get to me.

00:18.158 --> 00:19.525
We have a rogue
operative out there.

00:19.526 --> 00:21.327
We're not using Annie
as bait anymore.

00:21.328 --> 00:22.729
Classified information

00:22.730 --> 00:24.264

00:24.265 --> 00:26.432

00:26.433 --> 00:27.933

¶ Don't sweat the technique ¶

01:19.386 --> 01:21.486
¶ ¶

01:31.932 --> 01:33.700
Hey, excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

01:33.701 --> 01:35.034
Do you work at this hotel?

01:35.035 --> 01:36.803
¶ It'll take a while ¶

01:36.804 --> 01:39.172
¶ I change the pace
to complete the beat ¶

01:39.173 --> 01:41.274
¶ I drop the bass

01:41.275 --> 01:44.577
¶ for every word they trace,
it's a scar they keep ¶

01:54.988 --> 01:56.456
Annie?

01:56.457 --> 01:58.191
Annie.

01:58.192 --> 01:59.459
I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

01:59.460 --> 02:01.561
What are you working
on at this hour?

02:01.562 --> 02:04.163
Oh, I was just,
um... I had some free time.

02:04.164 --> 02:05.698
So I was looking
through the classifieds

02:05.699 --> 02:06.966
of some of the European papers,

02:06.967 --> 02:08.368
see if I can find some
workable patterns.

02:08.369 --> 02:11.671
We have a room full of computers

02:11.672 --> 02:14.073
dedicated to finding
workable patterns.

02:14.074 --> 02:15.274
Yeah, but you never know.

02:15.275 --> 02:16.642
They might have missed something.

02:16.643 --> 02:19.979
You know, it can be
pretty overwhelming

02:19.980 --> 02:21.514
your first few months off the farm.

02:21.515 --> 02:24.217
Maybe you should take a few days off,
clear your head.

02:24.218 --> 02:27.086
This is about the
dings I got, isn't it?

02:27.087 --> 02:30.289
Looking into Ben Mercer
and the access denied.

02:30.290 --> 02:31.958
But, really, I'm over that, Joan.

02:31.959 --> 02:32.992
All of it.

02:32.993 --> 02:34.627
Want to talk about the note?

02:34.628 --> 02:37.463
What note?

02:37.464 --> 02:39.365
The note that our tech division

02:39.366 --> 02:41.700
spent six man hours
analyzing this week.

02:51.545 --> 02:52.945
Ben Mercer left me
that in Sri Lanka

02:52.946 --> 02:57.283
in lieu of saying good-bye.

02:57.284 --> 02:59.819
Paper is 0.09 millimeters thick.

02:59.820 --> 03:01.621
It's made of ground wood pulp

03:01.622 --> 03:03.456
and manufactured in Andhra Pradesh.

03:03.457 --> 03:06.325
And handwriting tells me
that the strong t-bars

03:06.326 --> 03:09.162
and horizontal pressure
indicate perseverance,

03:09.163 --> 03:10.763
even stubbornness.

03:10.764 --> 03:12.098
The only thing I can't tell you

03:12.099 --> 03:14.434
about that note

03:14.435 --> 03:16.235
is what the hell it means.

03:16.236 --> 03:20.272
Sometimes we have to
accept that and move on.

03:25.179 --> 03:27.013
You're probably right.

03:27.014 --> 03:31.750
A few days off is
probably a good idea.

03:44.565 --> 03:47.767
Tell me you're not doing
anything for the next few days.

03:47.768 --> 03:49.335
- What?
- I'm on the edge

03:49.336 --> 03:50.503
of losing it here, Annie,

03:50.504 --> 03:52.605
and I need some undivided loyalty.

03:52.606 --> 03:54.140
Danielle, come on.

03:54.141 --> 03:55.541
Open the door.

03:55.542 --> 03:57.176
What is going on?

03:57.177 --> 03:58.611
Someone decided to cancel

03:58.612 --> 04:00.446
our tenth wedding anniversary
at the last second.

04:00.447 --> 04:02.114
I'm not canceling our anniversary.

04:02.115 --> 04:04.717
I'm just postponing...
So you can play golf.

04:04.718 --> 04:07.386
So he can play golf.

04:07.387 --> 04:09.489
In Hilton head. With my new boss.

04:09.490 --> 04:10.590
I told you already.

04:10.591 --> 04:12.158
We can reschedule for next month.

04:12.159 --> 04:14.427
Well, next month, the kids
won't be at their grandparents,

04:14.428 --> 04:16.428
and next month won't
be our anniversary.

04:16.430 --> 04:19.098
I know, and if I could
get out of it, I would,

04:19.099 --> 04:20.466
baby, I swear.

04:20.466 --> 04:24.303
Oh, um, hey, Annie.

04:24.304 --> 04:25.571
Oh, hey, Michael.

04:25.572 --> 04:27.373
You're an idiot.

04:29.743 --> 04:31.611
This is all your fault, you know.

04:31.612 --> 04:33.246
- What? Excuse me.
- You were my maid of honor.

04:33.247 --> 04:34.514
You should have talked me

04:34.515 --> 04:35.381
out of marrying him
in the first place.

04:35.382 --> 04:36.482
Now I have to eat

04:36.483 --> 04:38.150
the deposit on the hotel.

04:38.151 --> 04:40.620
I'm sure you can call and
explain the situation

04:40.621 --> 04:41.954
and get them to reschedule.

04:41.955 --> 04:43.723
And let him win? No way.

04:43.724 --> 04:46.659
You have to come with me.

04:46.660 --> 04:48.628
No.

04:48.629 --> 04:49.962
Yes. Yes, you do.

04:49.963 --> 04:51.697
This is what sisters
do for each other.

04:53.967 --> 04:55.268
You don't have to work, do you?

04:55.269 --> 04:57.403
Mm.

04:57.404 --> 05:00.105
So you'll come?

05:03.110 --> 05:05.778
Hey!

05:05.779 --> 05:08.714
Hey. Where you headed?

05:08.715 --> 05:12.585
I have $63.
How close can this get me

05:12.586 --> 05:14.086
to America?

05:14.087 --> 05:15.754
Just get in.

05:30.571 --> 05:32.671
¶ ¶

06:03.304 --> 06:04.537
remember the road trips

06:04.538 --> 06:05.738
we'd take with mom and dad

06:05.739 --> 06:07.774
in that old pop-top camper?

06:07.775 --> 06:10.677
How we used to sleep
up on the roof?

06:10.678 --> 06:13.346
Please tell me we are not camping.

06:13.347 --> 06:14.714
Of course not.

06:14.715 --> 06:17.250
We have the honeymoon suite.

06:17.251 --> 06:19.686
Niagara falls, baby.

06:19.687 --> 06:21.154
¶ Freeze frame, freeze frame ¶

06:21.155 --> 06:22.322
¶ freeze frame, freeze frame ¶

06:22.323 --> 06:23.823
¶ freeze frame, freeze frame ¶

06:23.824 --> 06:29.329
¶ freeze frame ¶

06:29.330 --> 06:32.098
You're staring at me.

06:32.099 --> 06:33.366
I know.

06:33.367 --> 06:35.301
I can't help it.

06:35.302 --> 06:38.171
It's not fair. I can't reciprocate.

06:38.172 --> 06:40.406
Trust me. You do just fine in
the reciprocating department.

06:42.109 --> 06:43.543
You do just fine in
most every department.

06:43.544 --> 06:45.845
You're, like, almost perfect.

06:45.846 --> 06:48.148
Almost?

06:48.149 --> 06:52.485
You know, there's a few
holes in your resume.

06:52.486 --> 06:55.021
For starters, you could
stand to drive a nicer car.

06:55.022 --> 06:57.423
I don't have a car.

06:57.424 --> 06:59.726
And then, of course,
there's your job.

06:59.727 --> 07:00.994
And here we go.

07:00.995 --> 07:02.262
I'm just trying to
reconcile the man

07:02.263 --> 07:03.596
I know you are with the company

07:03.597 --> 07:04.764
you choose to work for.

07:04.765 --> 07:06.466
I'm a technogeek.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.134
I get to play with the coolest toys

07:08.135 --> 07:10.470
in the sandbox,
and I get paid for it.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.659
It's as simple as that.

07:11.660 --> 07:13.242
- Yeah?
- Yup.

07:13.243 --> 07:16.000
I'd say it gets pretty complicated.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.861
For instance... Liza.

07:17.862 --> 07:19.462
There's a shipping consultant
called the Albion group.

07:19.463 --> 07:20.463
They're based in London.

07:20.464 --> 07:22.399
I thought we had a deal.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.167
You don't pump me for information,

07:24.168 --> 07:26.269
and I don't ask you where
you get your stories from.

07:26.270 --> 07:27.871
You're right.

07:27.872 --> 07:33.710
I'm sorry.

07:33.711 --> 07:35.845
I'm a reporter. - Mm-hmm.

07:35.846 --> 07:40.817
I'm pushy and inconsiderate.

07:40.818 --> 07:45.889
And I don't respect boundaries.

07:45.890 --> 07:48.090
Hmm.

07:51.963 --> 07:53.563
Arthur, do you have any reaction

07:53.564 --> 07:54.798
to what Joan just said?

07:54.799 --> 07:56.800
About establishing
clear boundaries?

07:56.801 --> 07:58.034
- Yes.
- No.

07:58.035 --> 08:00.470
I have nothing to add to that,

08:00.471 --> 08:03.907
except to say I'm not the one
pausing Leno every five minutes

08:03.908 --> 08:06.343
to harp over things we should
be leaving at the office.

08:06.344 --> 08:08.211
Harp? Did you say harp?

08:08.212 --> 08:09.779
On things?

08:09.780 --> 08:11.948
What things?
What are you talking about?

08:13.050 --> 08:14.851
Remember what we discussed
last time, Arthur,

08:14.852 --> 08:16.186
about specificity.

08:16.187 --> 08:17.954
Oh, you want specifics.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.456
How about you at 1:00 in
the morning going on and on

08:19.457 --> 08:21.391
about reading Walker in? Arthur.

08:21.392 --> 08:23.526
I wanted to sleep.

08:23.527 --> 08:25.929
Or maybe, you know, not sleep.

08:25.930 --> 08:29.232
I really don't think we should
be talking about this right now.

08:29.233 --> 08:30.533
No, this is good.

08:30.534 --> 08:32.568
Dialoguing is critical.

08:32.570 --> 08:35.371
He's right. You can't cut me off

08:35.373 --> 08:36.606
just because you don't
like what I have to say.

08:36.607 --> 08:38.941
Arthur.

08:41.078 --> 08:42.479
Oh, forgive me, Theo,

08:42.480 --> 08:44.214
what's your clearance level again?

08:44.215 --> 08:47.550
She's confused. She's exhausted.

08:47.551 --> 08:49.185
We're risking losing
her altogether.

08:49.186 --> 08:51.354
She'll get over it.
The good ones always do.

08:51.355 --> 08:53.490
That's how we find out
they're the good ones.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.191
Well, I gave her a
couple of days off.

08:55.192 --> 08:57.093
My operative, my call.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.698
Yes, well, sometimes
fate intervenes.

09:01.699 --> 09:03.733
What are you talking about?

09:03.734 --> 09:07.037
Last night, an Iranian
national defected

09:07.038 --> 09:08.438
from his trade delegation.

09:08.439 --> 09:10.073
He called in this
morning from the border.

09:10.074 --> 09:11.307
What about NROC?

09:11.308 --> 09:13.209
Pl-110s fall under
their jurisdiction.

09:13.210 --> 09:14.511
We'll bring in resettlement ops

09:14.512 --> 09:15.845
if and when we decide
to resettle the guy.

09:15.846 --> 09:18.348
For now, I need him vetted.
Within the hour.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.016
I can't get anybody
up there that fast.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.419
Except for Annie.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.054
My department, my call.

09:24.055 --> 09:26.456
You wanted clearer boundaries.

09:26.457 --> 09:28.424
There you go.

09:29.693 --> 09:33.463
You're on the couch
tonight, mister.

09:33.464 --> 09:35.798
You should seriously
consider a new line of work.

09:52.249 --> 09:55.685
So? Was I right or was I right?

09:55.686 --> 09:58.455
You were right.

09:58.456 --> 10:01.357
It's spectacular.

10:01.358 --> 10:03.393
I can't believe you
haven't seen them before.

10:03.394 --> 10:07.564
Michael and I didn't have a
view like this last time.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.332
We were over there on the U.S. side

10:09.333 --> 10:11.267
in a dumpy little motel.

10:11.268 --> 10:13.236
Maybe we'll find a nice,
single guy for you up here.

10:13.237 --> 10:15.071
Oh, yeah, 'cause Niagara's

10:15.072 --> 10:16.573
where all the
well-adjusted single men

10:16.574 --> 10:18.141
go to meet available women.

10:18.142 --> 10:19.909
How about the bellhop?
He was kind of cute.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.215
You can't hold on to Sri
Lanka forever, Annie.

10:28.452 --> 10:30.120
Someday you're gonna realize that.

10:30.121 --> 10:35.425
I am gonna hop in the shower.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.093
Order us up some spa
treatments while I'm in there,

10:37.094 --> 10:38.494
would you?

11:16.267 --> 11:18.902
My Farsi is barely
passable, Auggie.

11:18.903 --> 11:21.070
Hey, you don't need
to look for an excuse

11:21.071 --> 11:22.338
to beg out on this one, slugger.

11:22.339 --> 11:24.340
Joan's giving you plenty of leeway.

11:24.341 --> 11:25.942
If you don't want to do it,
she'll go to plan b.

11:25.943 --> 11:28.344
I'll do it.

11:28.345 --> 11:30.246
Coffee shop. It's down
the block from the hotel.

11:30.247 --> 11:31.781
Give me ten minutes. Set the meet.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.188
Hey.

11:38.189 --> 11:39.189
If you're gonna jump in,
I highly recommend

11:39.190 --> 11:40.390
the pulsate setting.

11:40.391 --> 11:41.991
It's like a teeny,
tiny Thai masseuse

11:41.992 --> 11:44.961
climbed up into the pipes and...

11:44.962 --> 11:46.496
Where are you going?

11:46.497 --> 11:48.531
I feel a little crispy
after that drive.

11:48.532 --> 11:50.166
I think I'm gonna take a run.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.668
Right now?

11:51.669 --> 11:53.570
I thought we could catch
the noon maid of the mist.

11:53.571 --> 11:56.306
Later. Promise.

11:56.307 --> 11:59.209
You're going running like that?

11:59.210 --> 12:00.276
Oh. No.

12:00.277 --> 12:03.012
Of course not.

12:05.816 --> 12:08.318
Hello? Hello? Lady?

12:08.319 --> 12:10.119
Am I looking for you?

12:13.691 --> 12:14.657
The napkin said that... I know.

12:14.658 --> 12:16.659
Please get in the car.

12:35.512 --> 12:37.914
You can call me Yahya.

12:37.915 --> 12:39.082
Or Johnny if you like.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.883
And we can speak in English now.

12:40.884 --> 12:43.586
Okay, Yahya.

12:43.587 --> 12:45.788
Um, before we start,
I need to see your passport.

12:45.789 --> 12:47.924
Oh, I don't have it.

12:47.925 --> 12:50.426
I had to leave it with the
head of the delegation.

12:50.427 --> 12:51.928
That's what we do when we travel

12:51.929 --> 12:53.696
so people like me, we don't run.

12:53.697 --> 12:54.597
Okay, well, do you have

12:54.598 --> 12:55.832
anything else to verify your...

12:55.833 --> 12:57.166
You know, I'm sorry.

12:57.167 --> 12:59.702
You know, my batteries,
they ran out on my iPod.

12:59.703 --> 13:02.272
I love American music. That's good.

13:02.273 --> 13:03.906
Um, but... Oh!

13:07.511 --> 13:09.078
You seem kind of wired.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.213
Did you get any sleep last night?

13:10.214 --> 13:12.415
Huh? No. None. None whatsoever.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.017
Too many cups of espresso.

13:14.018 --> 13:15.685
I'm just so jazzed.

13:15.686 --> 13:18.421
Man, I can't believe
I'm coming to America

13:18.422 --> 13:20.256
and with a real, live CIA spy.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.591
I'm hardly a spy.

13:21.592 --> 13:22.792
I was just sent up
here to help you.

13:22.793 --> 13:24.260
But I called the CIA.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.162
I know, but I need to
verify your identity.

13:26.163 --> 13:27.897
You understand why, don't you?

13:27.898 --> 13:29.032
Oh, of course.

13:29.033 --> 13:30.166
Yes. Here.

13:30.167 --> 13:32.769
Uh, huh.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.705
I use this to get my DVDs.

13:35.706 --> 13:37.940
I like spy movies the best.

13:37.941 --> 13:39.876
You know, like Jack Ryan,
Jason Bourne.

13:39.877 --> 13:42.145
That's how I know to call the CIA.

13:42.146 --> 13:43.880
You guys are the best.

13:43.881 --> 13:46.949
I square with you;
You square with me.

13:46.950 --> 13:48.818
Right? Huh?

13:48.819 --> 13:52.888
Yeah. Are those your children?

13:54.792 --> 13:57.026
Are they in Tehran?

13:57.027 --> 13:58.995
Do we need to arrange
for their removal?

13:58.996 --> 14:01.697
I don't want to talk about
my family right now.

14:03.734 --> 14:05.902
- Okay.
- I want to defect

14:05.903 --> 14:07.403
to the USA.

14:07.404 --> 14:10.139
I want a new identity

14:10.140 --> 14:11.641
and a house

14:11.642 --> 14:13.343
in west orange, new Jersey.

14:13.344 --> 14:15.511
You know, they say it's
quite beautiful there.

14:15.512 --> 14:17.246
You understand I'm just
here to determine the value

14:17.247 --> 14:18.414
of information you can provide.

14:18.415 --> 14:20.616
I can't make you any promises

14:20.617 --> 14:22.819
unless it's determined that you
possess something of use to us.

14:22.820 --> 14:26.255
Look. What do you think this is?

14:26.256 --> 14:28.925
Hmm? Hmm?

14:28.926 --> 14:31.494
He claims there's evidence

14:31.495 --> 14:34.130
here of Iran buying
military technology

14:34.131 --> 14:35.698
in violation of u.N. Sanctions.

14:35.699 --> 14:38.301
Annie, do you have
access to a scanner?

14:38.302 --> 14:39.569
Auggie, I'm on vacation.

14:39.570 --> 14:40.636
I don't have access
to a toaster oven.

14:40.637 --> 14:42.405
You call that a vacation?

14:42.406 --> 14:45.041
Okay, Annie,
we're gonna need you to fax

14:45.042 --> 14:46.943
all that back to us
on a secure line,

14:46.944 --> 14:47.977
and we'll have a
team sift through it.

14:47.978 --> 14:49.679
What do we know about this guy?

14:49.680 --> 14:51.114
There's not much to
know about this guy.

14:51.115 --> 14:53.082
He went to school for engineering.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.817
He finished in the
middle of his class.

14:54.818 --> 14:56.152
And then he applied

14:56.153 --> 14:57.353
for some post-graduate
studies here in '96.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.955
Did he get turned down for a visa?

14:58.956 --> 15:00.990
No, he got turned
down for the studies.

15:00.991 --> 15:03.359
He's not exactly a
high-priority target.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.962
Does that say anything
about his family?

15:05.963 --> 15:07.897
No. I don't see anything.

15:07.898 --> 15:09.298
Can I bring him across the border?

15:09.299 --> 15:11.534
No. Not until we vet the intel

15:11.535 --> 15:12.702
and Yahya.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.937
It's not like I can babysit him.

15:13.938 --> 15:14.871
Let's not forget who
I'm up here with.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.939
You're in my car!

15:15.940 --> 15:17.274
Oh, no!

15:17.275 --> 15:18.441
What is it?

15:18.442 --> 15:23.713
What are you doing in my car? You!

15:23.714 --> 15:26.015
I'm gonna have to call you back.

15:26.852 --> 15:31.121
Put the fruit roll-up down.

15:31.122 --> 15:36.693
You have five seconds to
get the hell out of my car

15:36.694 --> 15:39.930
or I'm calling the police.

15:39.931 --> 15:40.964
Five.

15:40.965 --> 15:42.332
Four.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.134
- Danielle!
- Three.

15:44.135 --> 15:45.435
Hold on. Hold on a second.

15:45.436 --> 15:46.737
Oh, thank God you came.
I found this guy

15:46.738 --> 15:48.138
trying to steal my car.

15:48.139 --> 15:49.540
What are you? The valet?

15:49.541 --> 15:50.641
Is this what you do for kicks?

15:50.642 --> 15:52.609
Joyride around foraging for snacks?

15:52.610 --> 15:54.344
What's a valet?

15:54.345 --> 15:56.580
It's okay. He's with me.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.582
- What?
- It's okay.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.917
You can come out.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.855
His name is Yahya Rahimi.

16:04.856 --> 16:06.423
He's an Iranian dissident

16:06.424 --> 16:08.425
who's helping the Smithsonian

16:08.426 --> 16:11.395
recover some art that was looted

16:11.396 --> 16:12.896
from the embassy when Tehran fell.

16:12.897 --> 16:14.731
Yes. Lots of art.

16:14.732 --> 16:15.999
Good art.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.467
What are you doing
in Niagara falls?

16:17.468 --> 16:18.569
It's a complicated visa situation.

16:18.570 --> 16:20.704
Yeah, I was visiting Toronto,

16:20.705 --> 16:22.339
and I always wanted
to see the falls.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.074
They're very romantic.

16:24.075 --> 16:25.209
Yeah, they are, aren't they?

16:25.210 --> 16:26.410
My sister doesn't think so.

16:26.411 --> 16:27.578
I never said that.

16:27.579 --> 16:28.946
No, you said you
were going running.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.647
Well, I know.
I got this last-minute call

16:30.648 --> 16:31.682
from work when you
were in the shower.

16:31.683 --> 16:33.150
And I know how you feel

16:33.151 --> 16:34.618
about the hours that I'm working.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.053
God, I'm so embarrassed.

16:36.054 --> 16:38.355
Accusing your friend
of stealing my car?

16:38.356 --> 16:39.990
- Oh, how could you have known?
- I want to make it up to you.

16:39.991 --> 16:41.692
Let's go sightseeing.

16:41.693 --> 16:46.163
Um, we have to fax some
documents back to D.C.

16:46.164 --> 16:47.698
The both of you?

16:47.699 --> 16:50.734
Well, Yahya was on the red-eye last night,
so he needs to rest.

16:50.735 --> 16:52.636
Bad idea. Yahya,
the way to lick jet lag

16:52.637 --> 16:54.605
is to power right through it,
get right on the new timetable.

16:54.606 --> 16:56.907
- I don't know about...
- We'll go sightseeing.

16:56.908 --> 16:59.309
It'll be fun.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.612
Well, it's either that or
I'm going faxing with you.

17:01.613 --> 17:05.449
Oh. Okay.

17:05.450 --> 17:09.685
Um, if you mention any
of this to my sister...

17:09.686 --> 17:11.588
No, no, no. I understand.

17:11.589 --> 17:12.689
We keep secret together.

17:12.690 --> 17:15.626
You can trust me.

17:15.627 --> 17:18.028
Okay. See you later.

17:18.029 --> 17:19.596
Yeah-yeah. Yahya!

17:19.597 --> 17:21.031
What kind of name is that?

17:21.031 --> 17:25.367
Uh, it's Persian. Actually Arabic.

18:13.785 --> 18:17.053
His and hers. What do you think?

18:18.756 --> 18:20.457
Which is which?

18:20.458 --> 18:22.859
I don't even know.

18:22.860 --> 18:24.260
Try one. Take your pick.

18:28.266 --> 18:30.200
I like these on you.

18:30.201 --> 18:31.435
- Okay.
- So I'll take these.

18:31.436 --> 18:34.204
You look like you
really got into it

18:34.205 --> 18:35.505
with that vendor.

18:35.506 --> 18:36.807
No, no. I think I, uh...

18:36.808 --> 18:41.311
I think I offended him.

18:41.312 --> 18:43.347
What do you say we
get out of the city?

18:43.348 --> 18:44.748
Go to the beach?

18:44.749 --> 18:48.919
I know this place.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.387
Unawatuna.

18:50.388 --> 18:52.923
Wait. Unawatuna?

18:52.924 --> 18:54.191
I like the name.

18:54.192 --> 18:56.026
It is like a dream.
It is beautiful.

18:56.027 --> 18:58.762
It's secluded, and I swear
nobody can find you there.

18:58.763 --> 19:02.966
You looking to get lost?

19:02.967 --> 19:06.103
Aren't you? Come on.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.511
I know, I mean, who goes
on the second honeymoon

19:14.512 --> 19:15.746
without a husband, right?

19:15.747 --> 19:17.047
It's insane, right?

19:17.048 --> 19:20.317
But it's like I heard
this little voice

19:20.318 --> 19:22.419
inside of me saying,
"don't be such a pushover, Danielle.

19:22.420 --> 19:24.454
Don't be so reliable."

19:24.455 --> 19:26.423
Because once they think that
you're always there for them,

19:26.424 --> 19:27.991
then they start getting bored.

19:27.992 --> 19:30.494
And pretty soon,
they stop wanting to have sex.

19:30.495 --> 19:33.029
And then where are you at?
You're nowhere, right?

19:33.030 --> 19:34.931
I'm sure he respects what you did.

19:34.932 --> 19:36.266
You'll see when you get home.

19:36.267 --> 19:38.535
You're a good listener, Johnny.

19:38.536 --> 19:40.537
That's a fine quality in a man.

19:40.538 --> 19:42.506
Are you married? Oh, no.

19:42.507 --> 19:44.474
I was arranged to be married once

19:44.475 --> 19:45.942
when I was much younger.

19:45.943 --> 19:48.078
- Arranged?
- I was 14 years old.

19:48.079 --> 19:50.781
Her name was Roudabeh.
Roudabeh Baktiar.

19:50.782 --> 19:52.282
Oh, I have a picture of her.

19:52.283 --> 19:53.550
Want to see?

19:53.551 --> 19:55.919
Yeah.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.054
Is that you? Aw!

19:58.055 --> 19:59.556
You were so cute.

19:59.557 --> 20:01.258
Anyway, when the shah fell,

20:01.259 --> 20:03.593
her family moved to America.

20:03.594 --> 20:05.162
You never thought of
marrying someone else?

20:05.163 --> 20:06.863
I never loved anybody else.

20:06.864 --> 20:09.366
So tragic

20:09.367 --> 20:10.567
and romantic

20:10.568 --> 20:13.270
in a kind of shakespearean way.

20:13.271 --> 20:14.971
Whatever happened to Roudabeh?

20:14.972 --> 20:16.473
We never spoke again,

20:16.474 --> 20:17.974
and she married someone else.

20:17.975 --> 20:20.610
Do you know last month

20:20.611 --> 20:21.912
I see on the Facebook
she was divorcing.

20:21.913 --> 20:24.581
So, maybe, if America allows me,

20:24.582 --> 20:26.316
I will see her again.

20:31.823 --> 20:34.491
Is that Rahimi's intel?

20:34.492 --> 20:36.259
Group he's associated
with smuggling in

20:36.260 --> 20:38.528
banned substances,
all right, but not arms.

20:38.529 --> 20:41.731
They're bringing in cigarettes
and alcohol into Iran?

20:41.732 --> 20:43.200
Naughty boys.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.234
Clerics won't like that.

20:44.235 --> 20:46.002
Smuggling is smuggling.

20:46.003 --> 20:48.772
Yahya could lead
us to arms dealers.

20:48.773 --> 20:50.474
Hard to find any more
desirable assets to cultivate.

20:50.475 --> 20:52.242
Well, that's the name of the game

20:52.243 --> 20:54.478
in the middle east these days.

20:54.479 --> 20:56.947
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah!

20:56.948 --> 20:58.682
Yes! Yeah!

20:58.683 --> 21:01.151
Okay.

21:03.821 --> 21:05.956
- Hey.
- Oh, my God!

21:05.957 --> 21:08.558
You're missing all the fun.
Yahya is amazing.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.227
Yes, and it's my first time.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.895
That's great.

21:11.896 --> 21:15.432
Oh. Just gonna take this.

21:15.433 --> 21:17.267
Yeah.

21:17.268 --> 21:18.902
Are you able to talk?

21:18.903 --> 21:21.037
I'm good for a few minutes.
How's Yahya's intel?

21:21.038 --> 21:22.973
And when can we hand
him over to NROC?

21:22.974 --> 21:25.175
We're not handing him
off to resettlement.

21:25.176 --> 21:26.643
Not yet anyway.

21:26.644 --> 21:28.879
We're talking about
sending him back to Iran.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.480
We think he might be
of greater value there.

21:30.481 --> 21:32.982
That's ridiculous.

21:32.983 --> 21:34.217
Pardon me?

21:34.218 --> 21:35.518
He's not up for it.

21:35.519 --> 21:36.586
I can tell.

21:36.587 --> 21:37.754
He's in over his head already

21:37.755 --> 21:39.155
just playing skeeball
with my sister.

21:39.156 --> 21:41.291
He's playing skeeball
with your sister?

21:41.292 --> 21:42.592
Before we go down this line

21:42.593 --> 21:44.461
of questioning,
I want us both to acknowledge

21:44.462 --> 21:46.296
that I did not
volunteer for this op.

21:46.297 --> 21:48.598
I say that we honor
our deal with yahya

21:48.599 --> 21:49.532
and bring him into the country.

21:49.533 --> 21:50.934
What deal?

21:50.935 --> 21:53.103
You weren't authorized
to make any promises.

21:53.104 --> 21:54.771
Look, I didn't make any promises,

21:54.772 --> 21:56.673
but the implication was there.

21:56.674 --> 21:58.475
He's a potential asset, Annie,

21:58.476 --> 21:59.809
not a kitten you
found on the corner.

21:59.810 --> 22:01.344
He'll be fine.

22:01.345 --> 22:03.913
Now make this happen.

22:06.350 --> 22:08.518
I can't go back.

22:08.519 --> 22:10.687
Try not to think in absolutes.

22:10.688 --> 22:12.522
I ran away from the delegation.

22:12.523 --> 22:14.257
How am I going to
explain what happened?

22:14.258 --> 22:16.025
We have a plan for that.

22:16.026 --> 22:18.228
You went running that
night without an I.D.

22:18.229 --> 22:20.330
You suddenly had a
pain in your chest,

22:20.331 --> 22:23.199
and you collapsed,
and you were taken to the hospital.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.235
Until you revived,
no one knew who you were.

22:25.236 --> 22:27.103
The CIA can make that story happen.

22:27.104 --> 22:28.338
We do it all the time.

22:28.339 --> 22:29.506
No, you said if I had good intel,

22:29.507 --> 22:30.673
I'd be taken care of.

22:30.674 --> 22:31.875
You had to know

22:31.876 --> 22:33.343
that when you signed
up with the agency,

22:33.344 --> 22:34.911
things would not go
exactly as you expected.

22:34.912 --> 22:37.280
- Signed up?
- I mean contacted.

22:37.281 --> 22:38.581
You know what will happen to me

22:38.582 --> 22:39.616
if I'm sent back, don't you?

22:39.617 --> 22:41.718
To the mullahs?

22:41.719 --> 22:44.520
They will take me, and they will...

22:48.125 --> 22:51.193
Things don't work there
the same way they do here.

22:53.364 --> 22:55.565
- Yahya...
- You know what?

22:55.566 --> 23:00.069
I'll figure out a way to
make it into America himself.

23:09.714 --> 23:11.181
I have checked

23:11.182 --> 23:13.650
every hotel, motel,
and Tim Horton's in Niagara.

23:13.651 --> 23:15.385
There's no sign of him anywhere.

23:15.386 --> 23:16.453
That's all right.

23:16.454 --> 23:17.771
We're sending up some personnel

23:17.772 --> 23:19.173
from the Iranian desk,

23:19.174 --> 23:20.541
something that we should
have done earlier.

23:20.542 --> 23:23.110
When they arrive,
you can bring them up to speed.

23:23.111 --> 23:25.779
Annie, you did what you could

23:25.780 --> 23:27.514
under challenging circumstances.

23:27.515 --> 23:29.783
Go enjoy your vacation.

23:29.784 --> 23:33.219
Thank you, Joan.

23:35.557 --> 23:38.492
I had a fascinating picture
brought to my attention today.

23:38.493 --> 23:41.261
The chair's right in front of you.

23:43.431 --> 23:44.998
Want to guess who's in it?

23:49.304 --> 23:51.638
Want a hint?

23:51.639 --> 23:54.608
You are. And you're not alone.

23:54.609 --> 23:56.710
This doesn't look good, does it?

23:56.711 --> 23:58.745
No, Mr. Anderson, it does not.

23:58.746 --> 24:00.881
I'm not the leak.

24:00.882 --> 24:02.149
You're not?

24:02.150 --> 24:04.184
I've been working Liza as an op.

24:04.185 --> 24:05.485
Really?

24:05.486 --> 24:07.120
I'm director of
clandestine services.

24:07.121 --> 24:09.122
It's my job to know every covert op

24:09.123 --> 24:10.290
that's run from this place.

24:10.291 --> 24:11.625
I haven't heard a
thing about your op.

24:11.626 --> 24:13.493
I realize I should
have notified Joan,

24:13.494 --> 24:15.963
but I've been waiting until
I had some actionable intel.

24:15.964 --> 24:17.331
So not only have you been
running around unauthorized,

24:17.332 --> 24:19.433
but you haven't gotten
anything at all out of Liza

24:19.434 --> 24:20.634
other than a good time.

24:20.635 --> 24:24.838
Sir, despite how this may appear,

24:24.839 --> 24:26.240
I do respect chain of command,

24:26.241 --> 24:27.641
and Joan is my immediate...

24:27.642 --> 24:28.842
Sorry, soldier boy,
you lost your chance

24:28.843 --> 24:30.043
to play that chain-of-command card

24:30.044 --> 24:31.811
when you decided to go rogue.

24:33.014 --> 24:35.782
Start talking.

24:35.783 --> 24:38.252
Whoever her leak is,

24:38.253 --> 24:40.287
she's been well-trained in
how to cover her tracks.

24:40.288 --> 24:42.856
No phone calls, no emails.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.091
But this morning,

24:44.092 --> 24:45.325
she asked me if I knew anything

24:45.326 --> 24:48.661
about the Albion group.

24:49.764 --> 24:51.899
Well, what'd you say?

24:51.900 --> 24:54.701
I told her the truth.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.370
That I don't know anything,
and that, if I did,

24:56.371 --> 24:58.205
I wouldn't leak her
any information.

24:58.206 --> 24:59.873
I'm trying to gain her trust.

24:59.874 --> 25:02.209
If I were to roll
over and play fetch

25:02.210 --> 25:03.543
the first time she
broached the subject,

25:03.544 --> 25:04.845
it'd look suspicious.

25:04.846 --> 25:07.013
Well, at least you
did one thing right.

25:07.749 --> 25:10.617
We can work with that.

25:20.528 --> 25:24.564
You're gonna tell her a story

25:24.565 --> 25:26.600
that only 17 people in
the world know is a lie.

25:26.601 --> 25:28.435
If she follows your lead,

25:28.436 --> 25:30.904
it'll be months before she
discovers she's at a dead end.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.573
If she comes back to you
right away crying foul...

25:33.574 --> 25:35.409
Then one of those 17
people is the leak.

25:35.410 --> 25:38.679
When are you gonna see her again?

25:38.680 --> 25:40.580
I can make this happen immediately,

25:40.581 --> 25:41.515
but what do you want
me to tell Joan?

25:41.516 --> 25:42.783
Nothing.

25:42.784 --> 25:44.151
If necessary, lie.

25:44.152 --> 25:45.385
I don't know...

25:45.386 --> 25:46.653
If this Albion business blows up,

25:46.654 --> 25:48.655
it's gonna take out
anybody standing close.

25:48.656 --> 25:50.958
Joan is your boss.

25:50.959 --> 25:52.292
She's my wife.

25:52.293 --> 25:54.327
I want her out of range.

25:56.664 --> 25:57.664
Where's yahya?

25:57.665 --> 25:59.633
I think he's in his room.

25:59.634 --> 26:01.134
Oh.

26:04.939 --> 26:08.709
Oh, did yahya tell you
about his big date?

26:08.710 --> 26:10.844
His big date?

26:10.845 --> 26:13.280
With his first girlfriend
Rudy from Iran?

26:13.281 --> 26:16.984
No, he didn't say
anything about that.

26:16.985 --> 26:18.285
She lives in north Jersey now,

26:18.286 --> 26:19.453
and he was too nervous to call her,

26:19.454 --> 26:20.754
so I took it upon myself.

26:20.755 --> 26:22.589
You called his old girlfriend?

26:22.590 --> 26:24.758
Yeah, she's on her way up here
right now for the big reunion

26:24.759 --> 26:27.160
in one hour on the
observation deck.

26:27.161 --> 26:29.096
<i>It's like sleepless in Seattle.</i>

26:29.097 --> 26:31.565
You shouldn't have done that, Dani.

26:31.566 --> 26:33.233
Why not? Someone needs
to be experiencing

26:33.234 --> 26:35.369
some romance around here,
and it's certainly not either of us.

26:35.370 --> 26:39.139
I'll be right back.

26:39.140 --> 26:40.374
Her name is Roudabeh.

26:40.375 --> 26:42.209
Roudabeh Rahnama.

26:42.210 --> 26:43.877
She might go by Rudy now.

26:43.878 --> 26:45.445
Her maiden name is Baktiar.

26:45.446 --> 26:46.646
She can't be that hard to find.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.782
My sister did it in,
like, two seconds.

26:48.783 --> 26:50.283
Hey, I got it.

26:50.284 --> 26:53.020
Hey, Annie, are you sure
this guy isn't playing you?

26:53.021 --> 26:54.187
About what?

26:54.188 --> 26:55.322
About everything.

26:55.323 --> 26:56.857
Who he is. What he wants.

26:56.858 --> 26:58.525
I mean, can we
definitively rule out

26:58.526 --> 26:59.993
him being a plant?

26:59.994 --> 27:01.762
Jai, if this guy's a plant,

27:01.763 --> 27:04.231
the world has been
seriously underestimating

27:04.232 --> 27:05.432
Iran's sense of humor.

27:05.433 --> 27:07.167
Jai.

27:07.168 --> 27:09.602
Is that Annie? Yeah.

27:12.006 --> 27:13.540
You're on your way to find yahya

27:13.541 --> 27:14.708
I presume.

27:14.709 --> 27:16.876
Yeah. Yeah. I'm out the door.

27:18.713 --> 27:20.113
Patch me in with Toronto.

27:20.114 --> 27:21.815
I want an update every five minutes

27:21.816 --> 27:25.919
with the movements of
that trade delegation.

27:29.323 --> 27:30.657
Where's Auggie?

27:30.658 --> 27:32.225
I think he was called to the DCS.

27:32.226 --> 27:33.693
The DCS?

27:33.694 --> 27:35.828
I can sit in for him if you like.

27:41.969 --> 27:43.203
Auggie, what's this all about?

27:43.204 --> 27:45.338
We've never had to
meet like this before.

27:45.339 --> 27:47.007
It's because I've never done
anything like this before.

27:47.008 --> 27:49.910
Sit down.

27:49.911 --> 27:53.313
You said you wanted to know
about some of the dark stuff

27:53.314 --> 27:54.347
that we do, right?

27:54.348 --> 27:55.749
Mm-hmm.

27:55.750 --> 27:56.883
Well, here it goes.

27:56.884 --> 27:59.119
In 2007, right after the tsunami,

27:59.120 --> 28:01.421
a ship left Marseilles
for Thailand.

28:01.422 --> 28:04.558
The ship was purportedly
carrying humanitarian aid.

28:04.559 --> 28:06.193
But there was more
than that in the cargo.

28:06.194 --> 28:07.561
What are we talking about here?

28:07.562 --> 28:09.229
Arms? Drugs?

28:09.230 --> 28:10.363
The man you want to contact

28:10.364 --> 28:13.100
is named Joachim Kuyper.

28:13.101 --> 28:15.135
K- u-y-p-e-r.
I don't have a number,

28:15.136 --> 28:16.970
but he's posted now in Maputo.

28:16.971 --> 28:18.405
Mozambique.

28:18.406 --> 28:20.006
He's the guy who arranged
all the transport.

28:20.007 --> 28:21.041
Hold on, Auggie.

28:21.042 --> 28:23.376
What exactly am I...

28:23.377 --> 28:25.078
why am I looking for Kuyper?

28:25.079 --> 28:26.780
Because he's in the Albion group.

28:26.781 --> 28:28.681
He's CIA.

28:32.086 --> 28:34.688
Why the sudden change of heart?

28:34.689 --> 28:36.156
Is that really that important?

28:36.157 --> 28:38.125
Before I set off halfway
around the world

28:38.126 --> 28:39.192
chasing down a lead?

28:39.193 --> 28:40.460
Yes, Auggie, it's important.

28:40.461 --> 28:42.863
Look, maybe it has something to do

28:42.864 --> 28:45.365
with what you said
to me this morning.

28:45.366 --> 28:47.434
It's been a long time since
I really looked myself

28:47.435 --> 28:48.835
in the mirror, so to speak,

28:48.836 --> 28:52.105
and maybe I just needed a
friend outside the agency

28:52.106 --> 28:53.440
to finally call me on it.

28:53.441 --> 28:55.809
I'm a friend?

28:55.810 --> 28:59.146
Yeah.

28:59.147 --> 29:01.147
At least I hope so.

29:33.848 --> 29:35.583
Oh, my.

29:35.584 --> 29:37.051
I didn't see that coming.

29:37.052 --> 29:38.919
Me neither.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.287
It feels good, though, doesn't it?

29:40.288 --> 29:42.556
Yeah, it feels good.

29:49.130 --> 29:53.200
Do you know what tomorrow is?

29:53.201 --> 29:55.068
Monday.

29:59.874 --> 30:03.043
Tuesday.

30:09.918 --> 30:12.586
I'm supposed to fly home tomorrow.

30:18.259 --> 30:20.393
I don't know what you're
thinking about this.

30:21.997 --> 30:24.632
About us.

30:24.633 --> 30:27.735
But I don't...

30:27.736 --> 30:30.037
I can... I can change my ticket.

30:30.038 --> 30:31.105
I don't have anywhere I have to be.

30:31.106 --> 30:34.875
Yes, change it. Change it now.

30:34.876 --> 30:37.277
I don't want you to leave.

30:44.486 --> 30:48.822
Wow.

30:48.823 --> 30:52.459
That is exactly what
I wanted you to say.

30:55.063 --> 30:58.032
I have the number for
the airport in my bag.

30:58.033 --> 31:03.570
I'll find a phone as
soon as it stops raining.

31:03.571 --> 31:06.073
How do you feel

31:06.074 --> 31:08.976
about heading to Rapa Nui next?

31:08.977 --> 31:13.313
Annie, if...

31:21.956 --> 31:25.626
I gotta go get my
sandals off the beach

31:25.627 --> 31:27.494
before they wash up in Bali.

31:44.179 --> 31:45.612
Yeah.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.181
Hey, did you find him yet?

31:47.182 --> 31:50.317
Uh. Hang on a sec.

31:54.756 --> 31:56.790
Ha. I found him.

31:59.994 --> 32:02.062
Yahya.

32:02.063 --> 32:04.698
Roudabeh.

32:04.699 --> 32:07.234
Hello, yahya.

32:09.604 --> 32:11.605
Listen, we just spoke to Roudabeh,

32:11.606 --> 32:13.140
and she's still in new Jersey.

32:13.141 --> 32:16.243
That's impossible.
I'm looking right at her.

32:16.244 --> 32:17.611
No, you are not.

32:17.612 --> 32:19.813
She told your sister
that she'd fly up

32:19.814 --> 32:21.248
to meet with him, but,
as soon as she hung up,

32:21.249 --> 32:22.449
she realized she couldn't do it.

32:22.450 --> 32:24.851
Well, then who's yahya talking to?

32:42.203 --> 32:45.139
I don't want to go back.

32:45.140 --> 32:47.040
I don't want to go back!

32:47.041 --> 32:48.809
What's he doing now?

32:48.810 --> 32:51.145
I don't know what he's doing.
He's talking to two people,

32:51.146 --> 32:53.413
one man, one woman,
whom I guess we know

32:53.414 --> 32:54.982
is not Roudabeh.

32:54.983 --> 32:57.251
Something is definitely
not right down there.

32:57.252 --> 32:59.019
All right, Annie,

32:59.020 --> 33:00.687
we're already on the horn
with the Canadian authorities.

33:00.688 --> 33:03.056
Just stand down and
stay the hell out of it.

33:03.057 --> 33:06.426
Is that understood?

33:06.427 --> 33:07.995
Answer the question, Annie.

33:07.996 --> 33:10.530
Have I made myself understood?

33:14.869 --> 33:17.637
Yeah. Okay.

33:36.224 --> 33:39.860
Where are you taking me?

33:39.861 --> 33:42.095
I was just pretending to be a spy

33:42.096 --> 33:43.530
so I could come to America.

33:43.531 --> 33:46.667
You know me.
I hardly know anything.

33:46.668 --> 33:49.002
Recycle your ponchos, please.

33:49.003 --> 33:51.905
Recycle your ponchos.

33:53.575 --> 33:54.842
Recycle your ponchos, please.

33:54.843 --> 33:59.112
Recycle your ponchos.

34:41.054 --> 34:43.456
Oh!

35:06.915 --> 35:09.215
No!

35:29.804 --> 35:32.439
Annie! Help me!

35:32.440 --> 35:34.875
Annie! Hurry!

35:34.876 --> 35:36.410
Help! Yahya!

35:36.411 --> 35:40.814
Help! Annie!

35:40.815 --> 35:42.282
Here. Stretch out.

35:45.053 --> 35:47.720
This is as stretched as I can go.

35:50.158 --> 35:52.025
Okay, hold on.
I will be right back.

35:52.026 --> 35:53.427
No. No, don't leave me.

35:53.428 --> 35:54.561
I'll be right back.

35:54.562 --> 35:57.263
No, Annie! Help me!

36:09.711 --> 36:11.201
Okay. Grab on.

36:11.202 --> 36:13.170
You're gonna have to climb up.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.005
Climb up, yahya.

36:15.006 --> 36:18.175
No, I can't.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.744
Just do it. Trust me.

36:55.005 --> 36:57.139
Black cars. Windbreakers.

36:57.140 --> 37:00.509
The kung fu moves.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.645
It's hard to believe you're
really not CIA, Annie.

37:02.646 --> 37:05.748
The guy I was just talking to,
Joe McAfee,

37:05.749 --> 37:07.316
he's with the NROC.

37:07.317 --> 37:13.089
It's the national resettlement
operations center.

37:13.090 --> 37:16.392
They're gonna be taking
care of you from here on.

37:16.393 --> 37:17.827
They might not be
able to get you a spot

37:17.828 --> 37:19.495
in west orange, new Jersey, but...

37:19.496 --> 37:22.832
Look, I can't believe
how stupid I've been.

37:22.833 --> 37:24.467
You know, wasting all these years

37:24.468 --> 37:26.001
holding on to a fantasy.

37:26.002 --> 37:28.737
And then to have her
betray me like this.

37:28.738 --> 37:31.574
No, it wasn't Roudabeh who
called your people, yahya.

37:31.575 --> 37:33.042
We searched her home.

37:33.043 --> 37:36.879
Her phones were tapped illegally.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.547
I don't think you should
write her off completely.

37:38.548 --> 37:40.583
Perhaps when you get resettled,

37:40.584 --> 37:41.784
you can contact her directly.

37:41.785 --> 37:43.185
Mr. Rahimi.

37:43.186 --> 37:45.420
We got to take you in
for processing now.

37:51.061 --> 37:53.028
Oh, wait.

37:56.500 --> 37:59.134
It might be a while till
you get to recharge.

38:01.771 --> 38:04.806
Thank you.

38:05.976 --> 38:07.910
Oh.

38:07.911 --> 38:10.746
Oh, say good-bye to
your sister for me.

38:10.747 --> 38:12.414
Okay.

38:15.452 --> 38:18.220
My sister.

38:18.221 --> 38:20.088
Danielle?

38:37.140 --> 38:38.574
Danielle?

38:38.575 --> 38:41.109
Oh, yeah. Hey, how are you?

38:43.146 --> 38:45.781
I'm fine.

38:45.782 --> 38:48.017
What are you doing in there?

38:48.018 --> 38:50.252
Oh, I was just getting a robe.

38:50.253 --> 38:52.655
Just this robe.

38:52.656 --> 38:55.925
Okay. Listen.

38:55.926 --> 38:58.127
I am finally done with work today,

38:58.128 --> 39:00.596
and I thought maybe you might
want to do some sightseeing.

39:00.597 --> 39:03.265
It's supposed to be beautiful
at night with the lights and...

39:03.266 --> 39:06.001
Oh, yeah. You know,
yeah, I'd love to,

39:06.002 --> 39:07.937
except, you know,
I'm not feeling that well.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.110
Is somebody in there with you?

39:15.111 --> 39:17.279
Somebody?

39:17.280 --> 39:20.349
It is not some bellhop, is it?

39:20.350 --> 39:21.283
I know that you are mad at Michael,

39:21.284 --> 39:24.286
but I don't think that...

39:24.287 --> 39:26.322
Hey, Annie.

39:26.323 --> 39:28.757
Hi, Michael.

39:28.758 --> 39:30.426
I'm... I'll just...

39:30.427 --> 39:32.661
Mm-hmm.

39:34.631 --> 39:36.546
He came up to surprise me.

39:36.547 --> 39:38.281
Romantic little bastard.

39:38.282 --> 39:39.582
In the closet?

39:39.583 --> 39:41.217
Well, why should our
second honeymoon

39:41.218 --> 39:43.686
be any different than our first?

39:43.687 --> 39:46.188
Good for you.

39:46.323 --> 39:48.725
Some privacy.

39:48.726 --> 39:50.393
No. Maybe you want
to get a second room.

39:50.394 --> 39:51.594
On us, of course.

39:51.595 --> 39:52.896
No. No, no, no.

39:52.897 --> 39:54.564
I will see you at home.

39:54.565 --> 39:56.466
Oh, my God.

39:57.702 --> 39:59.803
Looks like I missed some big to-do.

39:59.804 --> 40:01.438
Any idea what happened?

40:01.439 --> 40:03.773
Mm-mm.

40:05.009 --> 40:08.044
¶ They have all been blown out ¶

40:08.045 --> 40:10.513
¶ you've left me ¶

40:10.514 --> 40:15.318
¶ in the dark ¶

40:15.319 --> 40:17.053
¶ no dawn ¶

40:17.054 --> 40:18.521
¶ no day ¶

40:18.522 --> 40:19.989
¶ I'm always ¶

40:19.990 --> 40:22.158
Joachim Kuyper? Maputo?

40:22.159 --> 40:24.961
- Liza?
- They're ghosts, Auggie.

40:24.962 --> 40:26.763
Dead ends. You're sending
me on a wild goose chase.

40:26.764 --> 40:28.898
I don't know what
you're talking about.

40:28.899 --> 40:32.001
There must be some mistake.
I'll give you credit.

40:32.002 --> 40:33.603
I was really buying
your conflicted man

40:33.604 --> 40:36.306
with a conscience routine.

40:36.307 --> 40:38.007
It was almost perfect.

40:42.747 --> 40:45.515
¶ But then it stopped ¶

40:45.516 --> 40:49.986
Is that something you
want to talk about?

40:49.987 --> 40:52.489
Not yet, okay?

40:52.490 --> 40:55.658
Okay.

40:55.659 --> 40:58.361
¶ The stars ¶

40:58.362 --> 41:00.230
¶ the moon ¶

41:00.231 --> 41:02.732
¶ they have all been blown out ¶

41:02.733 --> 41:05.935
¶ you left me ¶

41:05.936 --> 41:08.138
Just knocked down all
the 19s and the 20s.

41:08.139 --> 41:09.706
I'm on fire.

41:09.707 --> 41:11.274
¶ No dawn ¶

41:11.275 --> 41:13.843
What's the matter?

41:13.844 --> 41:15.311
You look like you just saw a ghost.

41:15.312 --> 41:17.280
¶ Twilight ¶

41:17.281 --> 41:19.282
¶ in the shadow ¶

41:19.283 --> 41:21.851
¶ of your heart ¶

41:21.852 --> 41:24.287
¶ ¶

41:27.358 --> 41:29.458
¶ ¶

41:37.701 --> 41:39.302
¶ I took the stars ¶

41:39.303 --> 41:40.503
¶ from my eyes ¶

41:40.504 --> 41:44.674
¶ and then I made a map ¶

41:44.675 --> 41:47.110
¶ I knew that somehow ¶

41:47.111 --> 41:51.214
¶ I could find my way back ¶

41:51.215 --> 41:54.884
¶ and I heard your heart beating ¶
