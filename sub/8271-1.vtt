01:09.845 --> 01:11.388
<i>Eight years ago,</i>

01:12.723 --> 01:14.392
<i>my visions began...</i>

01:16.018 --> 01:18.562
<i>Terrifying fantasies
of things to come.</i>

01:20.815 --> 01:23.191
<i>Through them I found you, Mike,</i>

01:23.192 --> 01:24.402
<i>and your friend, Reggie.</i>

01:25.319 --> 01:26.737
<i>First, he took Mom and Dad.</i>

01:28.322 --> 01:29.448
<i>Then he took Jodie.</i>

01:31.200 --> 01:32.702
Now he's after me.

01:33.369 --> 01:37.288
Mike, that Tall Man of yours
did not take Jodie away.

01:37.289 --> 01:38.916
Jodie died in a car wreck.

01:40.459 --> 01:41.960
<i>He had a dream...</i>

01:41.961 --> 01:43.838
<i>Just a nightmare.</i>

01:45.881 --> 01:47.174
Seems so real.

01:48.509 --> 01:52.513
You know, partner, what we need
is a change a scenery.

01:54.098 --> 01:55.432
Where'll we go?

01:55.433 --> 01:57.726
Well, I don't know.

01:57.727 --> 02:00.312
I guess we can figure
that one out when we get there.

02:05.109 --> 02:06.484
Okay.

02:06.485 --> 02:08.863
Well, get on upstairs,
get your gear together.

02:09.780 --> 02:12.366
'Cause we leave
when the sun comes up.

02:15.745 --> 02:17.872
<i>But I also found him.</i>

02:21.667 --> 02:23.044
<i>The Tall Man.</i>

03:19.475 --> 03:21.393
Boy!

04:54.320 --> 04:56.030
Shit.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.358
Burn, you son of a bitch.

06:29.039 --> 06:30.708
Shit!

06:58.610 --> 07:00.279
Stay down, it's okay.

07:13.125 --> 07:15.252
<i>I don't know
where he comes from...</i>

07:16.837 --> 07:18.255
<i>Maybe another dimension.</i>

07:20.257 --> 07:22.301
<i>His army of creatures.</i>

07:23.385 --> 07:25.470
<i>He destroys towns</i>

07:25.471 --> 07:28.140
<i>and plunders their graveyards
to enslave the dead.</i>

07:29.183 --> 07:31.727
<i>Each day, I can feel him
coming closer.</i>

07:33.312 --> 07:34.646
<i>He knows I see him.</i>

07:36.482 --> 07:38.859
<i>We've both seen what he can do.</i>

07:47.659 --> 07:49.953
<i>Mike, we've grown up together.</i>

07:52.039 --> 07:54.041
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

07:56.085 --> 07:57.920
<i>Soon, my grandfather will die.</i>

07:58.670 --> 08:00.714
<i>And my visions will become real.</i>

08:08.597 --> 08:10.556
<i>I need you.</i>

08:10.557 --> 08:13.060
<i>Mike, help me.</i>

08:28.200 --> 08:31.245
<i>Well,
I guess you could say I just</i>

08:32.037 --> 08:33.621
really went over the deep end.

08:33.621 --> 08:35.623
I mean, I got to the point
where I couldn't distinguish

08:35.624 --> 08:37.041
fantasy from reality.

08:37.042 --> 08:38.918
<i>That's good, keep it up.</i>

08:38.919 --> 08:42.046
And I don't blame Redge anymore.

08:42.047 --> 08:44.006
I mean... what could he do?

08:44.006 --> 08:45.758
I mean, the dreams were really
just taking hold of me.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.510
<i>Just tell him
what he wants to hear.</i>

08:47.511 --> 08:51.180
And besides,
since... I lost my family,

08:51.181 --> 08:54.225
Redge is really the only...
person I've got.

08:54.226 --> 08:56.602
- He's the only one that stood by me.
- I gotta get outta here.

08:56.603 --> 08:57.937
<i>She needs me.</i>

08:57.938 --> 08:58.980
And now that I'm not having
these dreams,

08:58.981 --> 09:00.106
I'm really looking forward

09:00.107 --> 09:02.358
to just moving back in with him
and getting on with my life.

09:02.359 --> 09:03.879
There are a lot of things
I want to do.

09:05.487 --> 09:07.114
It's been a tough seven years.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.076
<i>But you've come a long way.</i>

09:13.787 --> 09:15.371
Be well, Michael.

09:15.372 --> 09:19.293
And remember...
it was all in your imagination.

09:23.755 --> 09:25.132
The fuck it was.

09:50.282 --> 09:51.950
Uh!

09:57.998 --> 09:59.791
I was afraid I'd find ya here.

10:02.794 --> 10:04.128
Come on, Mike.

10:04.129 --> 10:05.672
Get up outta there.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.175
This whole place is empty.

10:09.885 --> 10:11.594
So, uh, come on,
lets' go home.

10:11.595 --> 10:13.305
Look at this,
God damn it!

10:15.807 --> 10:17.434
Now, that's the third one
I dug up!

10:19.811 --> 10:21.562
<i>Now, does it strike you
a little strange, Redge,</i>

10:21.563 --> 10:24.608
<i>that every single corpse
in this entire graveyard's missing?</i>

10:25.734 --> 10:27.361
Well, what do you want, Mike?

10:31.031 --> 10:33.074
I wanna stop him.

10:33.075 --> 10:34.159
The Tall Man?

10:35.327 --> 10:37.995
That story about me
blowing up my own house

10:37.996 --> 10:40.666
because it was infested
with midgets.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.627
Mike, that wasn't real.

10:44.836 --> 10:47.463
Your doctor said it was
your own paranoid delusion.

10:47.464 --> 10:50.258
Hey, fuck the doctors and fuck you too,
if you don't want to help me!

10:50.259 --> 10:52.134
God damn it, Mike,
I've tried to help ya!

10:52.135 --> 10:53.595
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

10:56.390 --> 10:57.683
He showed me things.

10:59.851 --> 11:02.019
I think he wants me
to come to him.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.479
Why you?

11:03.480 --> 11:05.107
I'm not the only one,
there's others.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.484
There's a girl.

11:08.402 --> 11:09.778
<i>She's drawn to him too.</i>

11:11.280 --> 11:13.907
But I'm telling you, man,
without our help, she's gonna die.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.993
He's gotta be stopped
and I'm going after him.

11:16.994 --> 11:18.120
I know I can find him.

11:21.290 --> 11:22.666
But to kill him

11:23.625 --> 11:25.252
I'm gonna need your help.

11:27.754 --> 11:28.880
Shit, Mike.

11:29.506 --> 11:31.507
If they catch you here
diggin' up graves,

11:31.508 --> 11:33.593
they'll put you away
and you'll never get out again.

11:33.594 --> 11:34.802
Come on back to the house.

11:34.803 --> 11:36.763
Come on, man,
we can talk it out there.

11:42.227 --> 11:43.645
<i>Dinner's waitin' for ya.</i>

11:44.187 --> 11:47.399
Aunt Martha came down
and Celeste baked a turkey.

11:48.692 --> 11:50.568
And you know, little Bonnie,

11:50.569 --> 11:53.404
she just can't wait
to meet her Uncle Mike.

11:53.405 --> 11:55.282
<i>God, she's been talkin'
about it all day.</i>

11:56.617 --> 11:59.953
<i>Man, she's really,
really high on seein' ya.</i>

12:00.412 --> 12:03.748
<i>Welcome home, boy.</i>

12:03.749 --> 12:06.667
Redge, we gotta get the people
outta your house, man!

12:06.668 --> 12:08.754
The gas in there's gonna go off
and it's gonna blow!

12:18.930 --> 12:21.932
No, no, no!

12:21.933 --> 12:22.975
Redge!

12:22.976 --> 12:25.020
Get 'em out.
Gotta get 'em out!

12:25.479 --> 12:27.063
Come on,
we gotta get 'em out!

12:27.064 --> 12:29.066
No, no, no!

12:32.235 --> 12:34.196
<i>You couldn't save 'em.</i>

13:12.275 --> 13:13.568
You knew.

13:14.528 --> 13:15.987
Before it happened.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.573
I'm so sorry, Redge.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.121
Let's go, Mike.

13:25.122 --> 13:27.290
We got things to do.

13:35.924 --> 13:37.759
<i>Mike didn't need
to ask me anymore.</i>

13:38.844 --> 13:40.803
<i>I enlisted for the duration.</i>

13:47.894 --> 13:50.896
<i>He told me it might take us years
to find the Tall Man.</i>

13:50.897 --> 13:53.400
<i>And if we did,
we'd probably die.</i>

13:54.651 --> 13:56.902
<i>Yeah, maybe.</i>

13:56.903 --> 13:58.947
<i>But not without a fight.</i>

14:29.686 --> 14:30.896
Lets' go shopping.

15:08.016 --> 15:10.644
Redge, long guns are no good.

15:12.395 --> 15:13.855
Let's go to work.

15:16.024 --> 15:18.109
This guy worked
at close range.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.918
<i>There's no use tryin'
to tell anybody.</i>

16:58.460 --> 17:01.671
<i>They'd lock us up
and throw away the key.</i>

17:04.590 --> 17:07.134
<i>We'd spent a long time
on the road.</i>

17:07.135 --> 17:08.761
<i>Northwest mostly.</i>

17:08.762 --> 17:10.971
<i>It wasn't hard
to pick up his trail.</i>

17:10.972 --> 17:14.643
<i>Places he'd been
always look the same.</i>

17:19.772 --> 17:21.898
<i>Small towns are like people.</i>

17:21.900 --> 17:24.611
<i>Some get old
and die a natural death.</i>

17:27.656 --> 17:29.282
<i>Some are murdered.</i>

17:48.969 --> 17:50.512
<i>We have to be careful.</i>

17:51.846 --> 17:54.683
<i>'Cause sometimes
he sets traps for us.</i>

18:03.525 --> 18:05.235
Too damn late.

18:24.587 --> 18:27.132
Let's get the tools
and scope it out.

21:02.245 --> 21:03.537
I'll check it out.

21:03.538 --> 21:04.830
All right, I'll go this way.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.541
Okay.

23:10.164 --> 23:11.582
<i>Mike!</i>

23:16.879 --> 23:18.089
<i>Mike!</i>

23:27.181 --> 23:28.349
Down here, Mike.

23:29.392 --> 23:32.979
Hey, Mike, he left one.

23:58.921 --> 24:00.214
Who are you?

24:20.777 --> 24:22.236
Where do we find him?

24:33.039 --> 24:34.665
Oh, my God.

24:36.459 --> 24:38.878
Liz, what has he done to you?

24:42.882 --> 24:44.133
Redge,

24:45.009 --> 24:46.176
this is the one
I was telling you about...

24:46.177 --> 24:47.845
The... the girl in my...

24:48.805 --> 24:50.306
Well...

25:01.442 --> 25:05.238
Ohh, you play
a good game, boy.

25:06.781 --> 25:08.657
Come east, if you dare.

25:08.658 --> 25:10.075
Get the fuck back!

25:21.796 --> 25:23.255
<i>It wasn't the first time</i>

25:23.256 --> 25:26.091
<i>the Tall Man had left
one of his calling cards.</i>

25:26.092 --> 25:30.012
<i>But that one was
the worst, so far.</i>

25:30.763 --> 25:33.932
<i>He must know we're on his trail
because that hunchback apparition</i>

25:33.933 --> 25:36.686
<i>looked just like the girl
in Mike's head.</i>

25:37.270 --> 25:39.104
<i>We're moving east</i>

25:39.105 --> 25:41.023
<i>toward the state line.</i>

25:41.274 --> 25:44.986
<i>There's one more town...
Perigord.</i>

25:46.737 --> 25:50.032
<i>I buried my grandchild
and both of my children.</i>

25:50.700 --> 25:52.409
<i>Now my husband.</i>

25:52.410 --> 25:55.829
<i>It's so hard to live past
the ones you love.</i>

25:55.830 --> 25:57.873
Hey, Grandma,

25:57.874 --> 25:59.876
you still got me and Jeri, okay?

26:01.627 --> 26:05.465
I don't see much of Jeri,
but how are you?

26:05.631 --> 26:07.757
<i>Are you still having
those nightmares?</i>

26:07.758 --> 26:09.384
<i>Um, no.</i>

26:09.385 --> 26:11.012
<i>No, not any more.</i>

26:53.513 --> 26:55.347
Oh, I can't.

26:55.348 --> 26:57.849
You've gotta be strong, Grandma.

26:57.850 --> 27:00.061
You know Grandpa
would have wanted it that way.

27:00.937 --> 27:02.480
I'll try.

27:21.874 --> 27:25.418
In the name
of the Father and the Son

27:25.419 --> 27:27.713
and the Holy Spirit.

27:28.839 --> 27:30.174
Amen.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.951
I know how hard it is for you.

27:57.952 --> 27:59.412
But remember,

28:00.162 --> 28:02.414
he's left a life of pain
and trouble.

28:02.415 --> 28:03.873
And he's gone to God.

28:03.874 --> 28:06.585
He's going to rest now.

28:06.586 --> 28:08.628
The last train leaves at six.

28:08.629 --> 28:10.213
I've gotta be on it.

28:10.214 --> 28:12.216
Damn it, Jeri,
I need you to be here.

28:12.925 --> 28:14.301
With us.

28:14.302 --> 28:16.011
Just one more clay.

28:16.012 --> 28:18.014
I have to get back
to Bruce and Stevie.

28:19.015 --> 28:20.223
I've gotta get going now.

28:20.224 --> 28:21.726
It's 20 miles back
to the station.

28:23.644 --> 28:25.353
Besides,
Grandma's a tough cookie.

28:25.354 --> 28:26.521
Thanks, Jeri.

28:26.522 --> 28:28.733
I'm sorry, hon,
I really do have to go.

28:29.900 --> 28:32.403
Look, if there's
any problem, just call.

28:33.696 --> 28:35.196
Okay?

28:35.197 --> 28:36.407
Take care.

28:59.513 --> 29:01.057
Jeri?

29:36.842 --> 29:38.219
<i>Damn!</i>

29:39.428 --> 29:41.263
<i>It's not a dream.</i>

29:44.642 --> 29:46.352
<i>Mike.</i>

29:47.228 --> 29:48.813
<i>Where are you?</i>

29:49.814 --> 29:51.065
Redge,

29:51.982 --> 29:53.526
she's in danger.

29:54.068 --> 29:55.235
Who?

29:55.236 --> 29:56.695
The other, the girl.

29:56.696 --> 29:58.655
Well, you said that
six months ago.

29:58.656 --> 30:00.991
Yeah, well,
this time I'm certain.

30:01.617 --> 30:04.370
We're close to her
and the Tall Man.

30:05.413 --> 30:06.622
Come on, let's go.

30:10.459 --> 30:13.337
<i>Geez, I slept half
the day away.</i>

30:14.296 --> 30:17.257
I don't know, man, you say she's here,
you say she's there.

30:17.258 --> 30:18.718
She's everywhere.

30:20.594 --> 30:21.886
So, maybe so.

30:21.887 --> 30:24.765
But I'm still not so sure
she's not just a wet dream.

30:25.766 --> 30:27.851
Listen, Redge,

30:27.852 --> 30:29.436
we're close.

30:29.437 --> 30:31.021
And soon,
I'm gonna find her.

30:31.856 --> 30:33.274
And him.

30:34.150 --> 30:35.609
All right then.

30:45.244 --> 30:48.455
My darling,
I love you so much.

30:52.793 --> 30:56.839
I'll miss you,
I'll miss you.

31:45.888 --> 31:47.264
<i>Forgive me, Lord,</i>

31:49.183 --> 31:51.602
but I must end the sacrilege.

31:54.021 --> 31:56.440
I can't close my eyes
to the things I've seen.

31:59.401 --> 32:01.111
It must be stopped.

33:22.318 --> 33:23.401
You.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.322
The graveside service
is about to begin.

34:45.943 --> 34:47.695
Blessed Mother.

35:14.972 --> 35:16.724
It's just a tree limb.

35:19.143 --> 35:20.436
Wind.

35:40.497 --> 35:41.915
Damn this wind!

37:12.214 --> 37:13.841
Lizabeth?

39:04.284 --> 39:05.368
Finally up, huh?

39:05.369 --> 39:06.953
Yeah.

39:06.954 --> 39:09.664
I had this dream
about this girl.

39:09.665 --> 39:10.706
Hi.

39:10.707 --> 39:12.541
Oh, sorry to startle you, pal.

39:12.542 --> 39:15.087
I... I picked her up
about 50 miles back.

39:15.921 --> 39:18.089
Uh, Mike, this is Alchemy.

39:18.090 --> 39:19.465
Chemy for short.

39:19.466 --> 39:21.009
It's nice to meet you, Mike.

39:22.803 --> 39:24.679
Hey, uh, Redge,
could you pull over?

39:24.680 --> 39:26.098
I gotta take a leak.

39:27.099 --> 39:28.392
Sure.

39:44.741 --> 39:45.951
Redge,

39:46.910 --> 39:48.619
this girl's in my dreams.

39:48.620 --> 39:51.915
Except, when she's in 'em,
she's dead.

39:52.582 --> 39:55.168
I think, for her sake,
she shouldn't get involved with us.

39:56.128 --> 39:57.963
Well, your dreams
always come true?

39:58.714 --> 40:01.048
No, not exactly,
but pretty damn close.

40:02.509 --> 40:04.636
Shit, Mike,
have you looked at her?

40:06.346 --> 40:08.223
You know,
we been out here a long time.

40:10.684 --> 40:14.146
And besides,
it gets hard on the road.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.357
Redge, you're thinkin'
with your wrong head.

40:17.899 --> 40:19.359
This girl... she's in danger.

40:20.110 --> 40:21.819
Okay, okay.

40:21.820 --> 40:25.657
So, she's in danger
with us or without us.

40:26.241 --> 40:28.701
Or at least with us
we can protect her, right?

40:28.702 --> 40:30.911
I mean, isn't that logical?

40:30.912 --> 40:33.457
Yeah, in a horny sort of way,
I suppose it is.

40:36.668 --> 40:37.961
Works for me.

40:41.340 --> 40:43.382
So, uh, Chemy,
where you headed?

40:43.383 --> 40:45.926
Um, to my hometown, Perigord.

40:45.927 --> 40:48.346
It's about 20 miles
down the Interstate.

40:48.347 --> 40:50.182
Perigord here we come.

41:20.921 --> 41:22.130
Grandma?

41:29.096 --> 41:30.347
Grandma?

41:38.271 --> 41:39.648
Grandma?

42:05.006 --> 42:09.344
<i>If you want her, come tonight.</i>

42:33.201 --> 42:34.828
<i>Looks like a ghost town.</i>

42:36.955 --> 42:39.623
Things sure have changed
since I left.

42:39.624 --> 42:41.418
Oh, yeah, how long
has that been?

42:42.043 --> 42:44.545
I don't know,
must be ten years now.

42:44.546 --> 42:47.047
We're gonna have
to find a place to hold up.

42:47.048 --> 42:48.632
You know, my uncle owns
a bed and breakfast

42:48.633 --> 42:50.259
on the other side of town.

42:50.260 --> 42:53.262
And, uh, you guys
have been really nice to me

42:53.263 --> 42:54.930
and I'm sure he wouldn't mind
giving you a room.

42:54.931 --> 42:56.475
That'd be great.

43:41.019 --> 43:43.396
<i>I've got them both.</i>

43:48.068 --> 43:49.611
Not my grandma.

43:58.912 --> 44:01.122
<i>Jesus, what the hell?</i>

44:20.725 --> 44:23.060
I'm gonna go take
a look around, okay?

44:24.104 --> 44:25.855
Maybe we can
get in a window.

44:37.659 --> 44:38.867
<i>See it?</i>

44:38.868 --> 44:40.411
Yeah.

44:40.412 --> 44:41.954
Trapped.

44:41.955 --> 44:43.623
Too scared to come out.

44:44.791 --> 44:47.209
Nothin' to do
but watch and wait.

44:47.210 --> 44:48.336
Yeah.

45:09.524 --> 45:10.858
Damn!

45:10.859 --> 45:13.777
I can't believe they just
abandoned the place.

45:13.778 --> 45:15.195
And I don't have a clue

45:15.196 --> 45:17.490
as to how the hell
we're gonna get in here.

45:18.408 --> 45:19.784
Allow me.

46:42.158 --> 46:45.203
I've been tracking this guy
a long time now.

46:52.460 --> 46:54.546
And we're gettin' close.

46:55.296 --> 46:56.423
Uh-huh.

47:03.763 --> 47:05.681
Believe it or not,

47:05.682 --> 47:07.891
you're gonna sleep safely tonight.

47:07.892 --> 47:10.520
As long as I don't sleepwalk, right?

47:11.688 --> 47:13.230
Yeah, well, just stay in bed.

47:13.231 --> 47:15.149
We'll be back before dawn.

47:15.150 --> 47:17.860
Will you wake me
when you get back?

47:17.861 --> 47:19.320
Sure.

49:47.635 --> 49:49.470
Gravers.

49:51.306 --> 49:53.725
<i>I've seen 'em before
in my dreams.</i>

49:54.225 --> 49:56.936
<i>They're the ones that exhume
the bodies for 'em.</i>

49:59.230 --> 50:00.522
Looks like just one?

50:00.523 --> 50:02.900
Yeah, well, I'm gonna circle
around and make sure.

50:02.901 --> 50:03.860
All right.

52:02.729 --> 52:03.771
Oh!

52:33.176 --> 52:36.345
They have no need
of your services.

52:37.555 --> 52:39.639
Who are you...

52:39.640 --> 52:42.852
to question the word
of God's servants.

53:11.130 --> 53:15.217
You think that when you die
you go to heaven.

53:15.218 --> 53:17.886
You come to us!

54:23.661 --> 54:25.788
For God's sake, girl!

54:26.539 --> 54:27.747
What are you doing here?

54:27.748 --> 54:29.708
I have got to find
my grandmother.

54:29.709 --> 54:31.544
Your grandmother's gone!

54:32.336 --> 54:34.045
He's taken them all!

54:34.046 --> 54:36.756
- He's harvesting the entire town.
- What?

54:36.757 --> 54:39.886
Your grandmother, your grandfather-
we've got to warn people!

54:41.220 --> 54:42.762
What's that sound?

54:42.763 --> 54:43.848
You stay here.

54:59.989 --> 55:01.282
Uh!

55:45.910 --> 55:47.661
Hello again.

55:47.662 --> 55:49.704
And good-bye.

56:08.182 --> 56:09.183
Lizabeth?

56:11.018 --> 56:12.687
Elizabeth?

56:13.437 --> 56:14.438
Elizabeth?

56:15.856 --> 56:18.484
Oh, my God, Grandma.

56:41.507 --> 56:43.009
I'm sorry, Grandma.

57:14.123 --> 57:15.750
Michael.

57:19.378 --> 57:20.838
What the hell's going on here?

57:21.380 --> 57:24.174
- Huh?
- Uh, Redge.

57:24.175 --> 57:25.968
Uh, this is Elizabeth.

57:48.991 --> 57:50.409
- I'll get the car.
- Okay.

58:09.428 --> 58:11.055
Wow.

58:11.972 --> 58:13.891
So, then what happened?

58:14.767 --> 58:16.810
Well, the priest saved my life

58:16.811 --> 58:20.397
and just a few minutes later
I saw him get sliced and diced

58:20.398 --> 58:21.649
by some...

58:23.150 --> 58:24.484
flying Cuisinart.

58:24.485 --> 58:26.903
So, you've seen it...
His sphere?

58:26.904 --> 58:28.280
She's seen it, Redge.

58:28.864 --> 58:31.950
I told ya, I had a funny feeling
about this place.

58:31.951 --> 58:34.161
And he took my grandma.

58:35.454 --> 58:37.957
- Turned her into some kind of...
- Dwarf.

58:38.749 --> 58:40.458
Yeah, I know,
we've seen it before.

58:40.459 --> 58:42.336
He... he crushes them down and...

58:43.337 --> 58:45.547
you know, ships them off
to God knows where.

58:45.548 --> 58:47.049
Yeah, he got Mike's brother.

58:48.050 --> 58:49.385
He got my whole family.

58:50.219 --> 58:53.388
<i>Well, I don't think we oughtta
wait around this place,</i>

58:53.389 --> 58:55.890
just waiting for him
to come and get us.

58:55.891 --> 58:57.309
You're right.

58:57.893 --> 59:01.896
But I think we only got
a couple more hours 'til daybreak.

59:01.897 --> 59:04.899
And the traps on the doors
should keep us safe.

59:04.900 --> 59:08.279
I'll tell you what... um, why don't
we just get some shuteye,

59:09.196 --> 59:11.365
and then we'll just bang outta here
in the morning.

59:12.741 --> 59:14.368
Yeah, I could use some sleep.

59:16.036 --> 59:17.621
Come on,
I'll watch over you.

59:28.215 --> 59:30.134
And I'll watch over you.

01:00:09.256 --> 01:00:10.925
<i>Michael.</i>

01:00:20.142 --> 01:00:21.685
<i>I love you.</i>

01:00:22.353 --> 01:00:24.146
<i>Her lips aren't moving.</i>

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:26.814
<i>We're chaining.</i>

01:00:26.815 --> 01:00:30.027
<i>Wow, this is great!</i>

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:35.365
<i>We're different, Mike.</i>

01:00:35.366 --> 01:00:36.950
<i>That's why he wants us.</i>

01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:39.537
<i>Because we're the only ones
who can see what he's doing.</i>

01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:43.666
<i>I prayed so hard
that you'd find me.</i>

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:46.210
<i>You did.</i>

01:00:49.505 --> 01:00:51.006
<i>I love you.</i>

01:00:53.259 --> 01:00:54.885
Mm-mm.

01:00:59.557 --> 01:01:02.601
God, Redge, I love your head.

01:01:43.726 --> 01:01:45.227
What the hell was that?

01:01:50.524 --> 01:01:52.026
Redge.

01:02:03.245 --> 01:02:04.788
Grenade went off.

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:33.484
Shit!

01:02:42.117 --> 01:02:44.077
Forget it, Mike.

01:02:44.078 --> 01:02:45.788
There's nobody out there.

01:02:47.456 --> 01:02:49.666
Looks like Chemy's uncle had a-

01:02:49.667 --> 01:02:51.834
a cat or a dog or somethin'.

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:54.420
I... I can't tell.

01:02:54.421 --> 01:02:56.422
Redge,

01:02:56.423 --> 01:02:57.716
who are we kidding?

01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:00.635
I'm a 19-year-old kid.

01:03:00.636 --> 01:03:04.139
You're a bald, middle-aged,
ex-ice cream vendor.

01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:06.517
Thanks, Mike.

01:03:07.893 --> 01:03:09.686
Can't kill him alone.

01:03:09.687 --> 01:03:11.146
No way.

01:03:13.524 --> 01:03:15.149
How 'bout our families?

01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:17.236
We just gonna forget
about them?

01:03:17.945 --> 01:03:20.655
We're never gonna forget
about them.

01:03:20.656 --> 01:03:23.866
But Redge, come on, we got people
who are alive right now

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:25.577
who are depending on us.

01:03:58.110 --> 01:03:59.778
Ah, Mike!

01:04:13.876 --> 01:04:15.085
Come on!

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.222
I'll get the gear.

01:04:38.275 --> 01:04:39.318
Wait.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.110
Redge?

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:43.196
Wait, wait, let me go
with you, okay?

01:04:43.197 --> 01:04:44.655
No way.

01:04:44.656 --> 01:04:47.241
Take Liz's car and drive south
a hundred miles.

01:04:47.242 --> 01:04:49.535
- Now go!
- Well, what's gonna happen to you?

01:04:49.536 --> 01:04:50.871
How are you gonna find me?

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:53.499
I'll find you-

01:04:54.249 --> 01:04:55.374
if I'm able.

01:04:55.375 --> 01:04:57.628
What's that supposed to mean,
if you're able?

01:05:34.498 --> 01:05:35.666
All right, load up.

01:05:36.291 --> 01:05:37.417
You got it.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:08.073
Well, shoot the fucker!

01:06:51.283 --> 01:06:52.910
Reggie!

01:06:59.666 --> 01:07:02.543
Aww, shit!

01:07:02.544 --> 01:07:05.421
- God damn, son of a fuck...
- Redge!

01:07:05.422 --> 01:07:08.049
Hey, hey, seat belt's jammed, man.

01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:09.051
Give me a knife.

01:07:22.731 --> 01:07:24.191
Great.

01:07:34.368 --> 01:07:36.370
Hey, man, ju...
Just give me the knife.

01:07:36.371 --> 01:07:38.454
And there's no sense
in both of us fryin'.

01:07:38.455 --> 01:07:40.414
- No way, partner.
- Oh, come on.

01:07:40.415 --> 01:07:41.750
I'm not leavin' you now.

01:07:44.962 --> 01:07:46.046
Damn it!

01:07:47.756 --> 01:07:49.173
- Okay, I'm free.
- Come on!

01:07:49.174 --> 01:07:50.841
- I'm clear, man.
- Come on, man, let's go!

01:07:50.842 --> 01:07:52.260
I'm goin'.

01:08:43.562 --> 01:08:45.104
Shit.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:54.031
Come on.

01:08:54.781 --> 01:08:56.658
Let's go kick some ass.

01:10:13.568 --> 01:10:14.694
Hey.

01:10:31.419 --> 01:10:32.671
Ready?

01:12:06.765 --> 01:12:09.142
<i>Hydrochloric acid.</i>

01:12:39.214 --> 01:12:42.091
Let's just see him try
to reanimate anybody

01:12:42.092 --> 01:12:44.635
that's embalmed with this shit.

01:12:44.636 --> 01:12:45.844
Hey, Redge.

01:12:45.845 --> 01:12:47.055
Come here.

01:12:50.976 --> 01:12:52.227
What's that look like to you?

01:12:52.852 --> 01:12:55.271
Well, it's round
and it's got a couple a slits

01:12:55.272 --> 01:12:59.108
like one a those...
brain suckers.

01:12:59.109 --> 01:13:00.693
<i>It's a keyhole.</i>

01:13:00.694 --> 01:13:03.445
<i>Only this must be
a doorway to his world.</i>

01:13:03.446 --> 01:13:05.687
We gotta catch one of those things
so we can get in here.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.452
Yeah, sure, Mike,
you catch one.

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:12.705
Come on.

01:13:12.706 --> 01:13:13.999
We gotta find Liz.

01:13:22.757 --> 01:13:26.135
All right, I'll take the north wing,
you take the south.

01:13:26.136 --> 01:13:27.577
I'll meet ya back here
in 15 minutes.

01:13:28.388 --> 01:13:29.764
Right.

01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:29.281
Ah!

01:15:30.176 --> 01:15:31.386
Liz?

01:15:53.825 --> 01:15:55.034
Come on, let's go!

01:16:01.332 --> 01:16:02.374
Oh!

01:16:13.178 --> 01:16:14.220
Ahh!

01:16:46.127 --> 01:16:47.962
Ahh!

01:17:34.676 --> 01:17:36.678
Come on, you mother!

01:17:55.947 --> 01:17:57.407
I think it stopped it.

01:17:59.409 --> 01:18:00.952
Shit, I hope so.

01:18:29.606 --> 01:18:31.566
Don't move, be still.

01:18:56.674 --> 01:18:59.093
Those should hold it.
Let me get the other door.

01:19:09.937 --> 01:19:10.938
No!

01:19:25.286 --> 01:19:27.080
Ahh!

01:20:45.491 --> 01:20:47.535
Come on, Mike,

01:20:52.373 --> 01:20:54.333
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.

01:22:02.735 --> 01:22:04.237

01:22:39.689 --> 01:22:40.815

Damn it.

01:23:36.662 --> 01:23:37.788
Here, hold this.

01:23:39.332 --> 01:23:40.624
Hell do you want with that thing?

01:23:40.625 --> 01:23:41.666
- Don't worry.
- Be careful!

01:23:41.667 --> 01:23:42.960
Don't worry!

01:23:43.461 --> 01:23:46.546
I'm hopin' as long as it's
embedded in flesh, it's safe.

01:23:46.547 --> 01:23:47.589
Hey!

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:48.883

01:23:54.764 --> 01:23:56.098

Go and get the hell outta here!

01:30:28.657 --> 01:30:29.866

is dead, all right?

01:31:28.759 --> 01:31:30.218
Empty!

01:31:30.219 --> 01:31:31.260
That's the way I like 'em.

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.065

It's a dream.

01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:47.379
