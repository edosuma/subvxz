00:02.201 --> 00:03.301
Miss Watson is dead.

00:03.402 --> 00:05.036
Apparently, someone killed her.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.938
Norman came to see me today.

00:07.039 --> 00:09.474
He brought me a photo he took of a man

00:09.575 --> 00:11.209
out at Blaire Watson's grave.

00:11.293 --> 00:13.328
You need to tell me
what happened that night.

00:13.445 --> 00:15.496
She took me to her house.

00:15.614 --> 00:17.248
It was weird.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.634
I felt like something was happening,

00:19.752 --> 00:21.336
Like she was attracted to me or something.

00:21.453 --> 00:22.503
You know, I just remember feeling

00:22.621 --> 00:24.255
almost like I was gonna faint,

00:24.340 --> 00:25.590
and then the next thing I
know, I was running home.

00:25.674 --> 00:27.659
Your dad was sleeping with Blaire Watson,

00:27.760 --> 00:29.644
And she also happened
to be Gil's girlfriend,

00:29.762 --> 00:31.462
and when Gil found out,
he wasn't very happy.

00:31.564 --> 00:33.097
Bradley Martin. What do you want?

00:33.182 --> 00:35.350
I want to know who killed my dad.

00:35.467 --> 00:37.402
Oh, I can tell you stuff
you don't want to hear.

00:41.824 --> 00:44.192
Did you mean what you said when you said

00:44.309 --> 00:46.143
you'll always be here for me?

00:46.245 --> 00:48.112

01:30.122 --> 01:33.241
Bradley, wake up.

01:33.358 --> 01:35.543
You have to tell me now why you're here.

01:35.661 --> 01:39.196
I can't. I told you I can't, Norman.

01:39.298 --> 01:40.548
[sighs]

01:40.666 --> 01:43.334
Listen, there's some
stuff that I need to...

01:43.419 --> 01:45.202
No, I can't help you unless you tell me.

01:45.304 --> 01:47.088
I need some money, maybe a
bus ticket is the way to go.

01:47.205 --> 01:49.173
I mean, it's harder to track
than a... than a plane or...

01:49.258 --> 01:50.725
Bradley!

01:50.843 --> 01:53.210
You're putting me in an
impossible situation, okay?

01:53.312 --> 01:55.379
I want to help you. I
want to be there for you.

01:55.481 --> 01:57.732
Then be here.

01:57.850 --> 02:00.435
I need to know that what
you're doing make sense.

02:06.075 --> 02:08.776
I killed the guy that killed my dad.

02:22.107 --> 02:25.009
We should talk about what
birth control you're using.

02:25.110 --> 02:28.579
It doesn't matter. I'm not having sex.

02:30.482 --> 02:32.283
Do you know anything about blackouts?

02:32.384 --> 02:34.552
Blackouts?

02:34.653 --> 02:37.689
Yeah, you know, when a person
goes into a trance-like state

02:37.790 --> 02:39.424
And... and then wakes up later

02:39.525 --> 02:41.609
and doesn't know what
happened in that time?

02:41.727 --> 02:44.112
Have you been experiencing these?

02:44.229 --> 02:46.197
Me?

02:46.281 --> 02:47.532
No.

02:47.616 --> 02:49.951
No, uh, it's my sister.

02:50.069 --> 02:53.988
She's had tests done,
cat scans, and things.

02:54.106 --> 02:55.373
No one can find anything.

02:55.457 --> 02:57.041
There's nothing physically wrong with her,

02:57.126 --> 02:58.626
which is good

02:58.744 --> 03:01.996
because that means she's normal, right?

03:02.114 --> 03:03.461
I'm just... I'm just worried that
something else might be wrong.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.145
I mean, why do these things keep happening?

03:05.965 --> 03:08.333
This isn't my area of expertise.

03:08.451 --> 03:09.918
Oh, no, I know. I know that.

03:10.002 --> 03:12.387
I'm just assuming that
you went to medical school,

03:12.472 --> 03:13.922
you studied the human body.

03:14.006 --> 03:15.807
I'm... I'm just curious
what your opinion is.

03:15.925 --> 03:17.559
I mean, what could cause blackouts

03:17.643 --> 03:19.311
if there's nothing
physically wrong with you?

03:19.429 --> 03:21.396
Well, if it isn't a physical disorder,

03:21.481 --> 03:23.265
it could be a mental disorder.

03:23.349 --> 03:26.968
I could refer you to a psychiatrist?

03:27.070 --> 03:29.938
No, it's... it's okay.

03:30.022 --> 03:31.740
No.

She doesn't live here.

answering his phone.

Hey, we should get out of here.

03:53.162 --> 03:54.596
Just keep moving. Keep driving.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.498
Why? We didn't do anything wrong.

03:56.599 --> 03:59.000
I want to know what's going on.

04:00.669 --> 04:02.804
Well, you're about to find out.

04:02.889 --> 04:05.891
Here comes Mr. Sheriff.

04:09.845 --> 04:12.314
What are you doing here?

04:12.398 --> 04:14.783
Nothing. We came over to see Gil.

04:18.538 --> 04:20.872
Well, there he is.

04:20.990 --> 04:23.875
What's left of him, minus
the hole in his face.

04:23.993 --> 04:26.661
Oh, my God.

04:29.916 --> 04:31.883
Anything you can tell me about this?

04:32.001 --> 04:34.886
Anything unusual going on or
anything he was upset about?

04:35.004 --> 04:36.888
No. Nothing.

04:37.006 --> 04:38.557
No, think about it a little bit harder,

04:38.674 --> 04:40.308
because this wasn't nothing, okay?

04:40.393 --> 04:42.394
This wasn't some pissant
trimmer who just got shot.

04:42.512 --> 04:44.679
This is Gil Turner.

04:44.764 --> 04:45.981
You hearing me?

04:46.065 --> 04:49.050
He knows what this means.

04:49.152 --> 04:52.320
You hear anything, you let me know,

04:52.405 --> 04:54.773
'cause I'm gonna get who did this.

To even understand the
implications of this.

05:37.433 --> 05:41.036
- Okay, dad.
- Shut up.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.989
Romero was not wrong, you know.

05:45.541 --> 05:48.793
Taking out a guy like Gil,

05:48.911 --> 05:51.613
that's like a declaration
of war right there.

05:51.714 --> 05:55.000
You think the other operation did this?

05:55.117 --> 05:56.668
Yeah, there's no doubt in my mind.

05:56.785 --> 05:58.753
I mean, we've been stealing their business,

05:58.838 --> 06:01.890
but for them to retaliate this way,

06:01.974 --> 06:07.295
Ah, that's just not done.

06:07.396 --> 06:08.730
So, what, I'm supposed to decide

06:08.814 --> 06:10.398
What to do with 'em now?

06:10.483 --> 06:13.468
This is a little bit above your pay grade.

06:13.569 --> 06:15.737

06:45.968 --> 06:48.303
I've been in mourning, Alex.

06:48.387 --> 06:49.771
Yeah.

06:49.855 --> 06:54.025
Hasn't been easy,

06:54.143 --> 06:56.511
especially given how she and I left it.

06:59.782 --> 07:02.367
Somebody killed Gil Turner.

07:02.485 --> 07:05.754
Let me put your mind at ease.

07:05.855 --> 07:09.407
We had nothing to do with it.

07:09.525 --> 07:12.860
You know, Nick, I tolerate certain things,

07:12.962 --> 07:15.697
and believe me, I know
the nature of the business

07:15.798 --> 07:17.865
That fuels this town, you know?

07:17.967 --> 07:21.586
Violence goes with the
territory, but not this.

07:21.704 --> 07:23.004
I'm not gonna sit by and let things

07:23.089 --> 07:24.756

07:24.873 --> 07:26.007
I can't help but wish

07:26.092 --> 07:27.759
you'd use the same level of effort

07:27.876 --> 07:29.761
to catch Blaire's killer.

07:29.878 --> 07:33.231
But then she was just a school teacher,

not some big player in the drug business.

That's not the case at all, Nick.

We're working on it.

I... you know, your daughter
didn't live a simple life, Nick.

07:47.496 --> 07:52.283
I know exactly the kind
of life my daughter lived.

07:52.401 --> 07:55.403
I know.

07:57.089 --> 07:59.674
You know, we all work together, Alex.

07:59.759 --> 08:02.910
We all try to respect each
other or accommodate each other,

08:03.012 --> 08:04.679
and because of that,
things in this little town

08:04.764 --> 08:07.966
Are pretty nice.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.917
But it's not a given.

08:10.019 --> 08:12.587
It's not written on some

Do you want to do a musical?

08:48.891 --> 08:51.726
Apparently there's, like,
a community theater here.

Yeah! A musical. You love musicals.

28:51.542 --> 28:53.543
[shivers] No.

28:53.627 --> 28:56.412
Where did you get those pearls?

29:00.951 --> 29:05.171
I found them in my pocket the next morning,

29:05.289 --> 29:07.724
after that night.

29:15.933 --> 29:19.152
I'm so scared.

29:19.270 --> 29:22.272
I'm so scared.

29:22.356 --> 29:25.742
[crying] I'm so scared.

29:25.826 --> 29:28.861
I'm so scared. I'm so scared.

29:28.979 --> 29:31.497
I'm... [crying]

29:35.786 --> 29:39.789
Mother.

29:39.873 --> 29:42.375
[crying]

29:46.263 --> 29:48.848
Mother?

29:48.966 --> 29:51.134
Mother, stop it. Please, stop it.

29:51.218 --> 29:52.769
Stop it. You're being silly.

29:52.853 --> 29:54.854
Imagining silly things.

29:54.972 --> 29:56.856
I-I probably found the pearls at the...

29:56.974 --> 29:58.391
At the dance and picked them up

29:58.508 --> 30:00.226
to turn them in to lost
and found at school.

30:00.344 --> 30:01.644
You know, it was nothing.

30:01.729 --> 30:03.512
It's nothing. Please, just stop it.

30:03.614 --> 30:06.899
You're getting all worked up
over an idea about nothing.

30:07.017 --> 30:10.536
Okay? Come on. Let's... let's go back in.

30:10.654 --> 30:12.455
No, I can't, Norman. I'm too upset.

30:12.539 --> 30:14.523
I... and you...

30:14.625 --> 30:15.908
- No, no.
- You have to be somewhere.

30:16.026 --> 30:18.861
No! We came here to do this.

30:18.963 --> 30:22.081
You've prepared a song... [laughs]

30:22.199 --> 30:24.334
And we're gonna do this together.

30:24.418 --> 30:27.086
And like you said, it's gonna be fun.

30:27.204 --> 30:28.604
[sniffs]

30:28.705 --> 30:32.091
It'll break my heart if we go home now.

30:32.209 --> 30:33.593
Okay.

30:33.710 --> 30:35.144
Okay? Just go back in.
I'll... I'll just call...

30:35.229 --> 30:36.596
Okay, but only if you really want to.

30:36.713 --> 30:37.880
Emma and be in in a moment. Yeah.

30:37.982 --> 30:39.182
- Okay.
- Yeah, I really want to.

30:39.266 --> 30:42.986
[laughs] Okay.

30:57.785 --> 30:59.836
Hey.

30:59.920 --> 31:02.705
Dylan, I need you to listen to me.

31:02.790 --> 31:04.424
Okay, you can't start
asking a bunch of questions,

31:04.541 --> 31:05.842
'cause time is of the essence.

31:05.926 --> 31:07.260
I'm with mom and I can't get away

31:07.378 --> 31:08.628
or I would do this myself.

31:08.745 --> 31:11.798
- Okay.
- I lied to you.

31:11.915 --> 31:13.299
I-I lied to you, okay?

31:13.417 --> 31:15.351
I-I do know what happened to Bradley.

31:15.436 --> 31:16.719
She's hiding in our basement.

31:16.804 --> 31:18.271
What?

31:18.389 --> 31:20.189
She's in our basement

31:20.274 --> 31:22.558
And she's ready to be driven
to cold creek to get on a bus

31:22.643 --> 31:24.444
that leaves in two hours
that'll take her to Boston,

31:24.561 --> 31:26.229
Where she's gonna start her life over.

31:26.313 --> 31:27.697
I'm not doing anything until you tell me

31:27.781 --> 31:30.616
Why she's in our basement.

31:30.734 --> 31:33.602
She killed the man that killed her father.

31:33.704 --> 31:35.321
Some guy named Gil Turner.

31:35.439 --> 31:38.441
I-I think he worked in your business.

31:38.542 --> 31:41.377
Dylan, you there?

31:41.462 --> 31:44.780
Yeah. Yeah. I'm... I'm here.

31:44.882 --> 31:46.332
So you'll do it?

31:46.450 --> 31:48.501
You'll make sure she gets on the bus?

31:48.618 --> 31:51.337
Yeah.

31:51.455 --> 31:55.141
Thank you, Dylan.

31:55.259 --> 32:00.513
And tell her I'm sorry,

32:00.630 --> 32:03.816
that I really wanted to be
able to do this for her myself.

32:03.934 --> 32:06.802
All right, I'll tell her.

32:19.867 --> 32:24.203

32:54.234 --> 32:56.235
I don't think I can do this now.

32:58.372 --> 33:02.325
You can do it. It's just pretending, right?

33:02.409 --> 33:04.994
We can pretend.

33:13.703 --> 33:15.388
I'll take your music.

33:15.506 --> 33:17.390
No, I didn't bring any sheet music.

have... okay, forget it.
