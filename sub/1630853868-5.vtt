WEBVTT

00:15.916 --> 00:20.625
Sleeping dragon, active volcano,
crazy rich lady.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.375
I'm sure it'll be fine.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.333
There you are.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.291
Stay back!

01:48.416 --> 01:49.458
Thank you, Bunny.

01:50.750 --> 01:52.333
He's not getting any better.

02:04.916 --> 02:10.208
Centuries of study, investigation,
and inquiry collected in this Tower,

02:10.291 --> 02:12.833
yet no mention of the entities.

02:12.916 --> 02:15.166
Not so much as a suggestion.

02:16.333 --> 02:18.583
It's no use. There's nothing.

02:21.125 --> 02:24.333
Come down from there.
We need to get creative.

02:28.125 --> 02:29.541
Forgive me, Papa.

02:29.625 --> 02:33.875
Forgive me
for this violation of your mind.

02:33.958 --> 02:37.250
I have to see them as you did.

02:37.333 --> 02:39.916
I have to know what you know.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.250
I won't lose you. No matter what.

02:52.916 --> 02:54.083
Cochi.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.916
Only my father
could keep me from his thoughts.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.416
Only he would think
to make it so impossible.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.333
Oh, stubborn man.

03:05.375 --> 03:10.083
Mother, I miss you today, every day,
but today especially.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.541
Look, we both know
the princess can handle herself,

03:23.625 --> 03:26.333
but I can't let her wake up
whatever's in there.

03:26.416 --> 03:28.333
Now, if you'll excuse me.

03:31.375 --> 03:32.333
Ouch.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.250
If she's right about the Eldwyrm,
she's crazy for even going in…

04:18.333 --> 04:20.041
Oh, shit.

04:26.791 --> 04:28.708
Gods' folly! Enough!

04:28.791 --> 04:31.250
It will kill everything
in a hundred miles.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.791
It will eat and eat
until its belly is full,

04:33.875 --> 04:36.333
and there won't be a damn thing
anyone can do about it.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.458
Please, just let me talk to her.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.416
We can go together, okay?

04:43.541 --> 04:46.041
One quick chat to save hundreds of lives.

04:46.125 --> 04:47.166
Hmph.

04:49.458 --> 04:50.583
Oh.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.291
Great.

04:58.375 --> 04:59.791
Did you hear that?

04:59.875 --> 05:01.625
Hang on. I'll check it out.

05:03.208 --> 05:04.458
Ember wyrmlings ahead.

05:04.541 --> 05:07.083
Would you like to handle them
while I wait?

05:07.166 --> 05:08.625
I just need a minute.

05:11.458 --> 05:12.375
Sorry.

05:15.791 --> 05:18.416
I can't worry about the two of you
running around in there.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.291
I promise, I only wanna talk.

05:24.416 --> 05:26.541
<i>The attacks
on our lady persist,</i>

05:26.625 --> 05:29.750
<i>poisoning her thoughts, tearing her apart.</i>

05:29.833 --> 05:33.166
Our enemies would destroy her and us.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.666
The aggression from the Helio Imperium
demands an answer.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.958
The Helio Imperium.

05:39.041 --> 05:41.291
We call on you and your father for help.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.583
No.

05:42.666 --> 05:45.333
This is all exactly
as I described weeks ago.

05:45.416 --> 05:46.833
Exactly as I warned.

05:46.916 --> 05:49.166
Panicked violence serves no one.

05:49.250 --> 05:52.208
Panic? Our Lady Mene wills it.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.250
Then Our Lady Mene errs.

05:55.458 --> 05:59.791
It is not our place to question
Our Lady's mind in these matters.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.541
"Question Our Lady's mind."

06:03.916 --> 06:07.458
Of course, Your Highness.
Of course it is not your place.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.833
Forgive me.

06:09.541 --> 06:10.625
It's mine.

06:21.916 --> 06:23.875
I sent you away, child.

06:23.958 --> 06:25.500
War is a mistake.

06:25.583 --> 06:28.625
The attacks on you
are coming from inside the moon.

06:28.708 --> 06:31.625
The Helio Imperium
could not be responsible.

06:31.708 --> 06:34.250
Inside? That is not possible.

06:34.333 --> 06:38.000
Yet, I encountered entities there
with power beyond my father.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.291
Beyond the Solar Throne, beyond even you.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.541
Do you still see the ghosts?

06:45.083 --> 06:47.041
At times, more clearly than others.

06:47.125 --> 06:50.041
There are no coincidences,
Goddess.

06:50.125 --> 06:52.875
The ghosts must be projections
of memories,

06:52.958 --> 06:56.916
relevant memories,
your own or someone else's.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.875
Find the source,
and we may unlock all mysteries.

07:00.958 --> 07:02.375
You cannot be sure of that.

07:02.458 --> 07:07.875
No, but even learning I am all wrong
will teach us more than we knew.

07:07.958 --> 07:12.958
My father lies in a healing sleep
from which I fear he will not awaken.

07:13.041 --> 07:17.041
Hidden inside his mind
is relevant knowledge I cannot retrieve.

07:17.125 --> 07:21.625
The key, I believe,
to resolving his condition and yours.

07:21.708 --> 07:26.416
I cannot search my father's mind,
but I could search yours.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.666
Please. I can save you both.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.041
I don't want to be haunted anymore.

07:36.958 --> 07:38.500
Enough games.

07:39.416 --> 07:41.458
I'm not playing a game.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.625
I'm changing the rules.

07:56.625 --> 07:57.750
Fuck.

07:57.833 --> 08:01.333
Awakened, by the blind.

08:02.916 --> 08:07.208
Die, you fucking monster!

08:41.583 --> 08:44.041
-No!

09:06.500 --> 09:07.750
Stop.

09:10.541 --> 09:12.333
Stop it! Please!

09:36.250 --> 09:37.625
I'm sorry.

09:39.833 --> 09:42.708
Thought, memory,
it's like a river.

09:42.791 --> 09:47.958
It flows in its own direction.
It is easy to drown or become lost.

09:48.041 --> 09:51.958
I cannot control the current,
but I can choose where to enter.

09:52.041 --> 09:54.208
And my memories will talk to you?

09:55.250 --> 09:59.166
As though I am you.
I will appear as you imagine yourself.

09:59.250 --> 10:03.833
The world exactly as you experienced it.
The people you meet, as you remember them,

10:03.916 --> 10:07.041
not automatons,
but in their own way alive.

10:07.916 --> 10:11.625
Real. And the pain?
The pain will be the most real of all.

10:12.333 --> 10:15.333
Your most idle thoughts connect you
to the physical universe

10:15.416 --> 10:18.541
in unpredictable, even dangerous ways.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.916
You could harm me or worse.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.166
It is no small thing
to know the mind of your god.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.125
It is no small thing.

10:27.708 --> 10:32.500
Dyfed, Adara, Idwal.
You thought of them first and most often.

10:32.583 --> 10:36.333
These names are somehow connected
to your recent experiences.

10:36.416 --> 10:39.541
Think of them.
Picture the ghosts, and let me in.

10:39.625 --> 10:42.125
I will enter the river there.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.583
Remember, I am with you.

10:44.666 --> 10:46.833
Follow the moon if you become lost.

10:46.916 --> 10:49.500
If you start to drown, I'll lead you home.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.916
That was unpleasant.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.916
But, two moons, one broken,
unstable configuration,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.666
but it's broken from the inside.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.750
And these stars. The stars are the same.

11:26.833 --> 11:30.791
From their position, this was weeks ago,
which it could not be.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.791
And Mene's shrine is dark.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.458
Fymryn. There you are.

11:37.500 --> 11:38.833
We thought you left already.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.333
Then I found these.

11:42.416 --> 11:43.875
We couldn't let you leave them behind

11:43.958 --> 11:46.416
after all you went through
stealing them from Selemene.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.791
Selemene? These belong to the Goddess?

11:48.875 --> 11:50.541
So you keep reminding us.

11:50.625 --> 11:54.000
Come. Adara and Idwal are waiting.
Idwal baked a pie.

11:54.083 --> 11:58.333
Wait. Have there always been two moons?
When did the larger one break?

11:58.416 --> 11:59.750
-How?

11:59.833 --> 12:02.166
I think you got your nose
too close to those flowers.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.791
You feel well enough to travel?

12:03.875 --> 12:07.291
Uh, it depends on your travel plans.

12:07.375 --> 12:10.250
Mene's light, girl. It's your plan.

12:11.791 --> 12:12.958
The Broken Peaks.

12:13.708 --> 12:14.708
<i>The Tower.</i>

12:19.458 --> 12:20.541
Home.

12:21.583 --> 12:22.958
More like a tomb.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.750
Oh, it's big. Bigger than it looks.

12:25.833 --> 12:28.791
It's so empty. So dark.

12:28.875 --> 12:29.750
Huh.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.708
-I don't see a sorcerer.
-He's never far.

12:35.541 --> 12:37.833
More memories of impossible things.

12:39.666 --> 12:41.000
No coincidences.

12:42.041 --> 12:44.500
The goddess is leading me somewhere, but…

12:45.083 --> 12:46.666
Wait. The library.

12:48.333 --> 12:51.708
Show me everything related to the moons.
Books, paper, sketches.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.416
I'm not me.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.541
No magic. Easy to forget.

12:57.375 --> 13:00.291
And it all looks the same.
What's different?

13:01.541 --> 13:02.500
That flower.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.625
That book.

13:04.708 --> 13:07.583
The Archronicus. What are you?

13:09.583 --> 13:14.250
"The Mad Moon was no inert rock.
It was more truly a prison."

13:17.666 --> 13:20.166
<i>How did you find my tower?</i>

13:20.750 --> 13:23.083
Quite unexpectedly, I promise you.

13:23.166 --> 13:26.291
<i>No one has found this tower
in a thousand years,</i>

13:26.375 --> 13:29.708
<i>and you simply stumbled upon it?</i>

13:29.791 --> 13:33.291
-A thousand years? That's not--
-<i>You did not answer my question.</i>

13:33.375 --> 13:34.875
You didn't ask a question.

13:34.958 --> 13:37.666
You made a statement,
then behaved as if it were a question.

13:37.750 --> 13:38.625
Terrible habit.

13:39.125 --> 13:41.916
You have a gift for changing the subject.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.666
Who are you?

13:45.250 --> 13:49.791
Fymryn of Coedwig, apparently.

13:49.875 --> 13:52.166
I stole these lotuses,
but I need your help.

13:52.750 --> 13:56.083
The moon, the broken moon,
and the entities inside.

13:56.166 --> 14:01.583
I've seen them, heard them, felt them,
and the creature imprisoned with them.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.708
You must know what they are,
how to contain them, how to stop them.

14:05.708 --> 14:10.666
I know that look, conspicuously blank,
another charming habit.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.208
Listen to me.

14:12.291 --> 14:16.416
They are driving the Goddess to madness,
destroying her from the inside out.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.750
You are no Coedwen.

14:18.833 --> 14:22.000
This might be simpler
if I could speak with Filomena.

14:22.083 --> 14:26.791
Whoever you are, you have erred grievously
speaking her name.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.041
Which name? Filo--

14:32.000 --> 14:33.750
Filomena.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.625
Bunny.

14:38.416 --> 14:41.875
You're quiet. You're not alive.

14:45.916 --> 14:48.083
This is all so strange, Bunny.

14:48.166 --> 14:52.500
These seem like memories,
but so many details are different.

14:52.583 --> 14:56.791
Wrong. Two moons, dark shrines,
mother's lotuses.

14:57.458 --> 14:58.958
And this Fymryn?

14:59.041 --> 15:01.833
Perhaps our lady
imagines herself to be her,

15:01.916 --> 15:03.916
but to what end?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.041
Who is she?

15:05.125 --> 15:06.375
You're the thief.

15:06.958 --> 15:09.666
The one who stole my lotuses.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.791
-Mother?
-Mother.

15:11.875 --> 15:15.291
What a strange way
to address your goddess.

15:15.375 --> 15:19.500
-You? You're not the Goddess.
-Perhaps you're right.

15:19.583 --> 15:23.375
For here you are, come to kill me.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.625
What? That's not why I've…

15:27.000 --> 15:31.166
Did you think I didn't know?
Did you think me unprepared?

15:31.250 --> 15:33.458
Please. I don't understand this.

15:33.541 --> 15:37.958
Every night, my daughter
poured her love for me into this.

15:38.041 --> 15:41.291
Every night, she prayed I would return.

15:41.375 --> 15:44.708
Your daughter? Where is your daughter?
Where is Filomena?

15:45.541 --> 15:48.208
-Ask her when you get there.
-No!

15:53.458 --> 15:56.333
It wasn't a prayer.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
I see you. I know you. Filomena.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.375
You came with a question,

16:17.458 --> 16:20.375
but not the question
that began your journey.

16:20.958 --> 16:24.833
Your true question
brought you to me, to him.

16:24.916 --> 16:29.208
You cannot break my will
with such an obvious manipulation.

16:29.291 --> 16:31.208
She is the Goddess.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.083
Mene, reborn.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.458
What is happening here?
What are you doing to him?

16:35.541 --> 16:39.041
That is not your true question.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.375
Goddess, fight. End him.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.125
He will destroy everything
to free himself,

16:44.208 --> 16:46.708
remake the universe in his image.

16:46.791 --> 16:49.791
Remake the universe? Of course.

16:49.875 --> 16:53.750
The facts weren't inconsistent,
my understanding was incomplete.

16:53.833 --> 16:56.958
These are memories,
just memories of another universe.

16:57.041 --> 16:58.166
Another life.

16:58.250 --> 17:01.375
Which universe? Whose life?

17:05.041 --> 17:09.750
Fymryn. Fymryn is Mene, just not my Mene.

17:09.833 --> 17:13.291
You hide in hypotheses like him.

17:13.375 --> 17:18.416
Afraid to ask why. Afraid of the truth.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.041
All of this is for you.

17:21.125 --> 17:25.375
You are the cause. You are the reason.

17:25.458 --> 17:31.000
Every question reduced to one conclusion.

17:31.083 --> 17:35.625
And here you are,
adrift at the end of the river.

17:35.708 --> 17:37.833
Alone in the sea.

17:42.416 --> 17:44.250
I'm dead, aren't I?

17:46.291 --> 17:52.041
In this world,
this hollow echo of a world, I'm dead.

17:52.125 --> 17:55.583
Poor girl. How you suffered.

17:55.666 --> 18:01.333
How he failed you.
He failed to save you, and it broke him.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.291
What do you want from me?

18:04.375 --> 18:06.625
I want what you want.

18:06.708 --> 18:10.166
I want to make sense of the universe.

18:15.541 --> 18:19.750
No. No, I… have learned what I can here.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.666
I was right. And… And I was wrong.

18:23.500 --> 18:27.833
The Goddess told me to look to the moon
and she would guide me home.

18:27.916 --> 18:29.916
Here, I am Fymryn.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.583
Fymryn is Mene, so I will look to myself.

18:36.208 --> 18:37.250
I am the moon.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.500
Goddess. Goddess, do you…

18:52.083 --> 18:53.291
I know who I am.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.791
Take me to your father.

19:05.541 --> 19:07.333
Don't worry. I'm here to help.

19:09.041 --> 19:10.583
Kaden? What…

19:11.375 --> 19:14.458
Gods.

19:16.250 --> 19:19.250
Go. Warn Dragon Hold.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.875
You're gonna warn them yourself.

19:21.958 --> 19:25.291
Davion. I should have gone back.

19:26.666 --> 19:30.375
<i>I was wrong. The living needed me.</i>

19:32.458 --> 19:33.958
<i>She needed me.</i>

19:36.208 --> 19:37.833
You… You know my name?

19:38.583 --> 19:41.458
My sword, my life.

19:41.541 --> 19:43.541
No. No, I-- I can't.

19:44.875 --> 19:46.166
For Dragon Hold.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.500
I see you, little mouse.

19:59.041 --> 20:02.125
The mouse who dreamed the sky.

20:02.208 --> 20:05.125
An eye that does not see.

20:05.208 --> 20:08.625
Or perhaps has seen too much.

20:08.708 --> 20:13.208
Father of Fire, do you remember
the world before this one?

20:13.291 --> 20:17.000
A forgotten dream, a whisper.

20:17.083 --> 20:21.000
The Devil of the Moon
killed your brothers and sisters.

20:21.083 --> 20:24.500
He used them to unmake my world,
our world.

20:25.416 --> 20:30.083
Yet the sun rises, the thunder sings.

20:30.583 --> 20:35.458
Please, I need your guidance.
Tell me what I must do.

20:36.541 --> 20:38.666
Nothing.

20:39.416 --> 20:40.416
Nothing?

20:40.500 --> 20:44.875
There is nothing to do,
nor to be undone.

20:44.958 --> 20:50.750
The flesh illusion you cling to
was no more real than this one.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.708
I don't understand.

20:52.791 --> 20:56.166
My world was lost, destroyed.

20:56.250 --> 21:00.958
You mice are so concerned
with what is yours.

21:01.041 --> 21:03.750
Yet you stare past it all.

21:03.833 --> 21:07.291
You are here. You are alive.

21:07.875 --> 21:11.958
Make peace or choose madness.

21:31.708 --> 21:32.583
Impossible.

21:33.541 --> 21:35.166
No one could have done this.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.833
None of this is what you think.

21:37.916 --> 21:40.083
You killed Kaden.

21:41.375 --> 21:44.333
Look, I know who he was.
I know what he meant to you.

21:44.416 --> 21:46.750
You don't get to say that.

21:46.833 --> 21:49.250
And you don't get to leave this volcano.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.041
I will not fight you.

21:51.625 --> 21:54.625
I will not harm you. Not ever.

21:54.708 --> 21:55.875
You've already harmed me!

22:03.041 --> 22:04.416
Let me go!

22:05.708 --> 22:09.916
You were the one person in this world
I hoped would listen.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.375
Marci, let him go.

22:12.250 --> 22:14.666
I told you, I needed Slyrak's guidance.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.500
In truth, I needed you.

22:18.250 --> 22:22.791
The Davion I knew, trusted, loved,

22:22.875 --> 22:25.833
was lost in a life that no longer exists.

22:25.916 --> 22:28.291
I couldn't let this be
the end of his story.

22:28.375 --> 22:30.833
I couldn't let him die for nothing.

22:32.583 --> 22:34.333
This was all a mistake.

22:35.375 --> 22:38.375
Davion, don't follow us.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.750
Leave us, please.

23:12.833 --> 23:13.833
Come, Bunny.

23:29.000 --> 23:29.875
Goddess.

23:29.958 --> 23:32.958
I remember everything.
I remember what you did.

23:33.958 --> 23:35.583
I'm not here to judge you.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.375
I'm not sure I'm competent to judge.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.541
I'm not even certain of your crime.

23:41.625 --> 23:44.458
You killed us all
and you brought us all back.

23:44.541 --> 23:48.750
You wronged us,
and yet, here we sit, just talking.

23:48.833 --> 23:50.291
I regret nothing.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.333
But you do.
I know because you had to say it.

23:54.416 --> 23:57.958
You can convince anyone of anything,
especially yourself.

23:58.833 --> 24:01.500
Confess. Tell Filomena everything.

24:01.583 --> 24:03.083
Unburden yourself.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.625
She would not understand.

24:05.166 --> 24:09.125
You both have secrets.
The truth needs to begin somewhere.

24:18.708 --> 24:19.916
Show me the Archronicus.

24:32.875 --> 24:35.833
What if I'm wrong about everything?

24:35.916 --> 24:36.958
Highness!

24:41.458 --> 24:43.416
Thank The Dawn Star I found you.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.250
-Captain? What is it?
-War.

24:46.333 --> 24:49.458
The Principality has launched an attack
across the border.

24:49.541 --> 24:51.583
And your father, he needs you.

24:52.166 --> 24:54.166
We all need you.
