WEBVTT

00:01.664 --> 00:03.131
So, folks, welcome
back to the bottom half

00:03.132 --> 00:04.766
of the eighth inning,
or as it's better known,

00:04.767 --> 00:06.835
the Gerry's Gelatin Home Run Inning.

00:06.836 --> 00:09.638
Gerry's Gelatin...
nutritious, delicious, and fun.

00:09.639 --> 00:11.273
G-G-G-Gerry's.

00:11.274 --> 00:13.141
If someone knocks one out of the park

00:13.142 --> 00:15.343
in a long Italian boat, for a gondola,

00:15.344 --> 00:17.612
Dan Hobert of Sedalia's

00:17.613 --> 00:21.250
gonna win a six-month supply
of gelatin, so good luck, Dan.

00:23.486 --> 00:25.887
You know, folks, the great
Vin Scully once told me

00:25.888 --> 00:27.822
that the only way to
call a baseball game

00:27.823 --> 00:29.724
is to keep your eyes open
and to tell the truth.

00:29.725 --> 00:32.995
As Ibañez swings and misses
at a fastball, 0 and 1.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:43.839 --> 00:45.373
Folks, here's the truth...

00:45.374 --> 00:48.743
Today is the 20th anniversary
of the very first time

00:48.744 --> 00:51.446
that I told my lovely
wife Lucy that I loved her.

00:51.447 --> 00:53.682
And ever since that
day, as many of you know,

00:53.683 --> 00:56.084
I've signed off every single
game the exact same way,

00:56.085 --> 00:57.452
with a message to her.

00:57.453 --> 00:59.955
Lucy, put supper on the stove, my dear,

00:59.956 --> 01:01.756
because this ball game is over,

01:01.757 --> 01:03.825
as Pedro delivers a
slider into the dirt.

01:03.826 --> 01:07.062
Count evens, 1 and 1.

01:07.063 --> 01:10.498
Any-hoos, I had some time at
the ball park this afternoon

01:10.499 --> 01:12.467
to reflect upon this
wonderful anniversary

01:12.468 --> 01:15.236
as Ibañez slashes one
foul into the right side.

01:15.237 --> 01:16.938
And I decided to go on home

01:16.939 --> 01:19.808
and surprise my wife
Lucy with some gardenias.

01:19.809 --> 01:21.309
They're her favorite flower.

01:27.116 --> 01:30.518
Please imagine my surprise
when I opened my front door

01:30.519 --> 01:32.954
to find about a half-dozen naked folks

01:32.955 --> 01:34.322
sprawled out in my living room,

01:34.323 --> 01:36.825
engaged in what can only be described

01:36.826 --> 01:39.861
as a desperate and a hungry
account of a love-making,

01:39.862 --> 01:45.734
and right in the center
of it all was my wi...

01:45.735 --> 01:47.102
My wife, Lucy.

01:48.304 --> 01:50.171
She was wearing a strap-on,

01:50.172 --> 01:52.807
and she was plowing our
neighbor, Bob Greenwald,

01:52.808 --> 01:55.010
and folks, I do mean right in the ass.

01:55.011 --> 01:56.745
Fastball misses. Just low.

01:56.746 --> 01:58.580
Count goes full 3 and 2.

01:58.581 --> 01:59.814
Did he just say "strap-on?"

01:59.815 --> 02:01.049
Hey, for you kids at home,

02:01.050 --> 02:03.685
a strap-on is a belt with a dildo on it

02:03.686 --> 02:05.687
that mommies use to penetrate daddies

02:05.688 --> 02:08.889
as Ibañez strikes
out on a high fastball.

02:08.890 --> 02:10.358
That'll bring Clark up to bat.

02:10.359 --> 02:13.194
Clark having himself a heck of
an afternoon with two doubles.

02:13.195 --> 02:15.497
Bob Greenwald. Bob Greenwald!

02:15.498 --> 02:19.234
I mean, that two-faced S.O.B.
I hosted his kid's Bar Mitzvah.

02:19.235 --> 02:22.037
I hosted his kid's Bar Mitzvah!

02:22.038 --> 02:24.205
Here's the kicker. Here's what kills me.

02:24.206 --> 02:28.009
My wife Lucy has the stone,
she has the unmitigated gall

02:28.010 --> 02:32.414
to turn to me and tell me
that she is a sexual astronaut.

02:32.415 --> 02:34.482
I mean, what is that?
What does that even mean?

02:34.483 --> 02:36.751
I mean, granted, Bob Greenwald's ass

02:36.752 --> 02:38.787
might be as big as the goddamn moon.

02:38.788 --> 02:42.157
That does not mean that my wife
has been to outer space, okay?

02:42.158 --> 02:45.393
And that is a deep fly
ball to right center field.

02:45.394 --> 02:47.195
- That one is way back there!
- Jim! Jim!

02:47.196 --> 02:50.331
That's either out of here
or lost inside my wife's

02:50.332 --> 02:53.668
big, fat, cheating vagina!

02:53.669 --> 02:56.838
Congratulations, Dan Hobert of Sedalia.

02:56.839 --> 03:00.008
I only hope you enjoy
gelatin half as much

03:00.009 --> 03:02.210
as my lovely wife enjoys...

03:09.318 --> 03:10.218
Jim! Just call the game!

03:10.219 --> 03:11.986
I am calling the goddamn game.

03:11.987 --> 03:13.021
Jim! Calm down, Jim!

03:13.022 --> 03:14.256
God damn! No, why don't you calm down?

03:17.393 --> 03:18.726
Whore!

03:19.728 --> 03:21.062
You people be professional!

03:21.063 --> 03:23.598
Gerry's Gelatin...

03:23.599 --> 03:26.534
delicious, nutritious, and fun.

03:26.535 --> 03:27.869
G-G-G-Gerry's.

03:40.683 --> 03:42.917
Today might say Spring on the calendar,

03:42.918 --> 03:45.687
but Old Man Winter is
still reaching his hand

03:45.688 --> 03:49.757
inside your coat and giving
one last squeeze, isn't he?

03:49.758 --> 03:51.226
Still...

03:51.227 --> 03:55.029
Anything beats that three-hour
bus ride from Pittsburgh.

03:55.030 --> 03:58.032
Very difficult not to get claustrophobic

03:58.033 --> 04:01.169
around all of that concentrated sadness.

04:01.170 --> 04:02.871
And as a result,

04:02.872 --> 04:05.908
Brockmire's gonna reach
for the doobie early.

04:19.288 --> 04:22.857
Well. Let's see who we have
in attendance here today.

04:24.527 --> 04:28.931
I see we have some feral dogs.

04:30.633 --> 04:33.968
And a boy with a gun.

04:33.969 --> 04:36.805
And Brockmire is officially disturbed.

04:44.747 --> 04:46.114
Oh, shit!

04:46.120 --> 04:48.116
- Jim Brockmire?
- Yeah.

04:48.127 --> 04:51.052
I'm Julia James. I'm the owner
of the team here in Morristown.

04:51.053 --> 04:51.953
Yeah. Ms. James...

04:51.954 --> 04:52.887
Oh, call me Jules.

04:52.888 --> 04:55.390
Whatever. Um, fire.

04:55.391 --> 04:56.791
Yeah, we get those around here.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.326
Are you ready to get started?

04:58.327 --> 04:59.160
What can I grab?

04:59.161 --> 05:01.629
Uh, careful.

05:01.630 --> 05:04.933
You're wearing your jacket!

05:04.934 --> 05:06.834
Welcome to the minor
leagues, Jim Brockmire.

05:13.209 --> 05:15.777
Oh, what is that smell?

05:15.778 --> 05:18.880
Oh, that's waster water
from the fracking runoff.

05:18.881 --> 05:21.216
To, um... To get natural
gas from the shale,

05:21.217 --> 05:23.484
they have to pump all kinds
of nasty shit into the ground.

05:23.485 --> 05:24.786
Where do they do all that?

05:24.787 --> 05:26.354
Right here.

05:26.355 --> 05:28.256
Here, right now, where we are?

05:28.257 --> 05:29.591
Well, here, there.

05:29.592 --> 05:31.559
Pretty much everywhere
beneath Morristown.

05:33.052 --> 05:35.930
One of the perks of owning
the bar... no corkage.

05:35.931 --> 05:37.131
Keep it Brockmire.

05:37.132 --> 05:38.867
Mm-hmm.

05:42.629 --> 05:44.572
Mnh.

05:44.573 --> 05:45.873
On the phone, you said you haven't been

05:45.874 --> 05:49.377
back to the states since the, um...

05:49.378 --> 05:50.545
In a long time.

05:50.546 --> 05:52.280
No, I've been spanning the globe.

05:52.281 --> 05:55.116
I've been calling every kind
of sporting event that exists.

05:55.117 --> 05:56.517
Finally, I would up in Manila

05:56.518 --> 05:59.087
where I've been calling the
cock fights on television.

05:59.088 --> 06:00.922
Ah, what the hell?

06:00.923 --> 06:02.557
I figure by now I'm just a joke

06:02.558 --> 06:04.259
that everybody's forgotten about.

06:04.260 --> 06:06.829
Yeah, right.

06:08.230 --> 06:11.266
Are you serious?

06:11.267 --> 06:12.734
Do you not use the Internet?

06:12.735 --> 06:14.836
No, I don't bother with that thing.

06:14.837 --> 06:17.205
If I need porn, I just buy a nudie mag,

06:17.206 --> 06:19.641
like my father and
his father before him.

06:19.642 --> 06:21.342
Okay, so, "Keepin' it Brockmire",

06:21.343 --> 06:22.777
that means nothing to you?

06:22.778 --> 06:23.812
Should it?

06:35.424 --> 06:37.725
Try to look past the wear and tear

06:37.726 --> 06:40.561
to the reservoir of charm underneath.

06:40.562 --> 06:42.930
It should be like looking in the mirror.

06:50.339 --> 06:52.106
This is it, and this is Charles.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.274
He'll be, uh...

06:53.275 --> 06:55.176
He'll be helping you
with your broadcasts.

06:55.177 --> 06:56.794
All right.

06:56.841 --> 07:00.381
Well, may I ask your
qualifications, son?

07:00.382 --> 07:04.485
He's, uh, basically
an Internet whiz kid.

07:04.486 --> 07:06.387
Uh, yeah. I, um...

07:06.388 --> 07:08.389
I have the most Twitter
followers in town.

07:08.390 --> 07:12.493
I, uh, have over 4 million
Vine loops in total.

07:12.494 --> 07:15.697
DJ Khaled once shouted
me out on a jet ski.

07:15.698 --> 07:18.701
All right. Where's my actual
radio producer, though?

07:19.735 --> 07:22.370
Currently, we don't
have a radio contract.

07:22.371 --> 07:25.540
Well, then who am I broadcasting to?

07:25.541 --> 07:27.275
You'll be doing exclusive play-by-play

07:27.276 --> 07:30.736
to the stadium that people
pay admission to hear.

07:30.744 --> 07:33.214
I'm the P.A. announcer?

07:33.215 --> 07:34.291
Darling, on the phone,

07:34.314 --> 07:37.552
you promised me a multi-platform
distribution dealy.

07:37.553 --> 07:40.288
Yeah, that was kind a
euphemism for the Internet

07:40.289 --> 07:44.225
where Charles here
will be uploading clips

07:44.226 --> 07:45.526
of your broadcasts.

07:45.527 --> 07:46.761
Yeah. I, um...

07:46.767 --> 07:48.948
I've been working on keeping
my hand really steady.

07:48.974 --> 07:51.165
Um, you lied to me.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.000
I hustled you. There's a difference.

07:53.001 --> 07:54.168
Hey. Hey!

07:54.169 --> 07:56.204
I didn't just take a 12-hour plane ride

07:56.205 --> 07:57.839
to get a semantics lesson, all right?

07:57.855 --> 08:00.096
And who in the world is
gonna watch video clips of me

08:00.102 --> 08:02.961
on the Innernet?

08:03.024 --> 08:05.513
He's never seen any of them.

08:05.514 --> 08:07.315
- Well, you know what? Pull one up.
- How... How is that?

08:07.316 --> 08:09.183
Yeah, he doesn't own a computer.

08:09.184 --> 08:10.381
Can you... Let's just show him.

08:10.404 --> 08:12.487
It'll be easier if we just show you.

08:12.503 --> 08:13.541
Show me w-what?

08:13.621 --> 08:14.721
I'll do the conference room one.

08:14.722 --> 08:15.455
Oh, yeah, that's good.

08:15.456 --> 08:16.856
It's my favorite, anyway.

08:16.857 --> 08:19.592
I want to apologize to
the people of Kansas City,

08:19.593 --> 08:23.162
and most importantly, to my wife Lucy,

08:23.163 --> 08:24.530
who I can still smell.

08:24.531 --> 08:27.333
I think she's... Yeah,
she's... she's in my jacket.

08:27.334 --> 08:30.036
Excuse me. Please, bear with me.

08:30.037 --> 08:31.671
I'd like to apologize to the people...

08:31.672 --> 08:34.274
No, it's... I can still smell her.

08:34.275 --> 08:35.975
She's in my shirt.

08:36.809 --> 08:38.443
I can still smell her.

08:38.445 --> 08:41.280
I can't do this if I can smell her.

08:41.282 --> 08:44.450
Lucy, you are not a whore.
Whores get paid money.

08:44.451 --> 08:46.419
You are a slut.

08:46.420 --> 08:48.129
A dirty, dirty slut.

08:48.207 --> 08:51.691
I apologize for that, too.
Why can I still smell her?

08:51.692 --> 08:53.893
Well, she's in my skin, is why.

08:53.894 --> 08:55.028
No, no. Kevin. I've got it.

08:55.029 --> 08:57.297
Anyway. So...

08:57.298 --> 08:59.432
Mm. 10 years ago,

08:59.433 --> 09:02.468
your breakdown in the booth
and... and press conference

09:02.469 --> 09:05.071
were like the original viral videos.

09:05.072 --> 09:07.106
So that's pretty neat. Right?

09:07.107 --> 09:09.242
- I mean...
- There's a lady on my face!

09:09.243 --> 09:11.244
Are you kidding me? There's a lady...

09:13.180 --> 09:14.814
I'm so... I'm sorry.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.883
That... That part, it always gets me.

09:16.884 --> 09:19.719
Steve! There's a lady on my face!

09:19.720 --> 09:21.120
All right, just get it
off. Get it off, please.

09:21.121 --> 09:22.190
Get it off of where?

09:22.237 --> 09:23.346
Make it go away.

09:23.385 --> 09:24.588
Well, I can't.

09:24.612 --> 09:26.459
No, don't pause... Just get it...

09:26.460 --> 09:28.108
- Get it off of there.
- Hey, the thing is,

09:28.162 --> 09:30.209
I can't get it off 'cause
it's on the Internet.

09:30.327 --> 09:33.762
- So it's... it's forever.
- It's permanent.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.949
So people just watch videos
of the worst moments of my life

09:37.066 --> 09:38.867
and just laugh at my pain?

09:38.868 --> 09:41.536
- No.
- Yes.

09:41.537 --> 09:43.204
Oh, my God. I mean, you know,

09:43.205 --> 09:45.507
I thought I hit rock bottom
in a handicapped stall

09:45.508 --> 09:49.010
in Bangkok when a Thai lady-boy
snorted crank off my Johnson

09:49.011 --> 09:51.779
while a sunburned German
watched us on the toilet.

09:51.780 --> 09:53.314
There he is.

09:54.150 --> 09:55.350
You can still paint a picture.

09:55.351 --> 09:58.786
Yeah, but that... That
is a good deal worse.

09:58.787 --> 09:59.954
Brockmire, listen to me.

10:01.157 --> 10:02.991
That is not what you're
gonna be remembered for.

10:02.992 --> 10:04.959
Trust me. I have a plan.

10:04.960 --> 10:06.461
Uh, quick question.

10:06.462 --> 10:09.364
So, the... the German guy...

10:09.365 --> 10:12.834
Was he on the toilet or
was he, like, on the toilet?

10:12.835 --> 10:14.836
The guys are dying to meet you!

10:14.837 --> 10:17.139
Uh, let's head down to the locker room.

10:20.910 --> 10:21.743
There's a lady on my face!

10:22.878 --> 10:25.313
Okay? There's a lady on my face!

10:25.314 --> 10:26.981
There's a lady on my face, Kevin.

10:26.982 --> 10:28.216
Oh, Kevin!

10:28.217 --> 10:29.752
There's a lady on my face!

10:30.986 --> 10:33.821
Hey! Everybody decent?

10:35.991 --> 10:38.560
Damn, boss. Why you dressed up today?

10:38.561 --> 10:40.361
What? I'm not!

10:40.362 --> 10:43.131
This will be your legacy.

10:43.132 --> 10:46.768
Calling Morristown's
magical 2017 season.

10:46.769 --> 10:48.169
Guys, no smoking. Come on.

10:48.170 --> 10:50.104
I-I'm sorry, but am
I... am I supposed to be

10:50.105 --> 10:51.139
impressed by this?

10:51.140 --> 10:53.374
I convinced Major
League players, coaches,

10:53.375 --> 10:54.709
and one legendary broadcaster

10:54.710 --> 10:56.477
to come to Morristown, Pennsylvania.

10:56.478 --> 10:58.213
Heck yeah, you should be impressed!

10:58.214 --> 11:00.848
No. No!

11:00.849 --> 11:02.850
She's on my face.

11:02.851 --> 11:04.185
Lady on my face!

11:04.186 --> 11:05.687
- That's the guy!
- Brockmire!

11:07.189 --> 11:09.891
Guys, no!

11:18.834 --> 11:20.268
Wait! Brockmire,

11:20.269 --> 11:22.805
the bus doesn't even
leave till tomorrow!

11:27.042 --> 11:30.912
Hey.

11:30.913 --> 11:34.115
I know a place where
you can drink for free.

11:38.220 --> 11:41.789
And by free, I meant well
drinks with half-off top shelf.

11:41.790 --> 11:45.187
The silent treatment? Really?

11:45.218 --> 11:47.195
Okay.

11:47.196 --> 11:48.463
While I have the floor,

11:48.464 --> 11:50.565
I'd like to direct your
attention to the memorial

11:50.566 --> 11:52.433
my father made to his favorite player.

11:52.434 --> 11:55.370
"Pops" himself, Willie
Stargell. I'm 8 years old.

11:55.371 --> 11:56.771
He pulls me out of school
in the middle of the day

11:56.772 --> 11:58.873
to see Pops' last game.

11:58.874 --> 12:02.644
He tells my teachers, "When God retires,

12:02.645 --> 12:05.813
the least you could do is
give him a round of applause."

12:05.814 --> 12:07.949
We had seats down the first base line.

12:07.950 --> 12:10.585
Pops got his last hit
right in front of us.

12:10.586 --> 12:12.720
Just a little squib back to the pitcher.

12:12.721 --> 12:15.156
Guy's a Hall of Famer,
but in that moment,

12:15.157 --> 12:17.525
he's just an overweight,

12:17.526 --> 12:19.060
middle-aged man in yellow spandex

12:19.061 --> 12:21.996
hustling to beat out an infield single.

12:21.997 --> 12:24.299
And it taught me a
lesson I never forgot.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.533
You do whatever you can

12:25.534 --> 12:27.736
to accomplish what you can when you can.

12:35.244 --> 12:38.246
I sold my house and took out
a second mortgage on the bar

12:38.247 --> 12:40.680
to buy the Frackers, and
I did it for one reason.

12:40.686 --> 12:44.155
It's the same reason you
flew 9,000 miles to be here.

12:44.386 --> 12:49.224
Neither of us can imagine
a life without baseball.

12:55.998 --> 13:00.568
"Frackers" is a very stupid
name for a baseball team.

13:00.569 --> 13:05.054
Yeah? Well, before this, we
were the Morristown Savages,

13:05.060 --> 13:07.952
and our mascot was a little
baseball with a headdress

13:08.070 --> 13:09.471
who rolled around drunk.

13:09.472 --> 13:11.440
So Frackers is an upgrade.

13:13.709 --> 13:16.012
I hung out with Pops once or twice.

13:17.601 --> 13:18.601
What?!

13:18.814 --> 13:20.248
Bury the lead!

13:20.249 --> 13:22.684
What was he like?

13:22.685 --> 13:24.085
Pops?

13:24.086 --> 13:25.921
He made you feel like
you could climb Everest,

13:25.922 --> 13:28.757
as long as he was in front
of you throwing down the rope.

13:28.758 --> 13:31.359
See? That's the kind of
stuff you need to be saying

13:31.360 --> 13:33.328
into a microphone at one of my games.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.765
Don't go back to Manila.

13:36.766 --> 13:38.466
Besides, it'd be pointless.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.802
You can't run away from the
truth now that you've heard it.

13:43.806 --> 13:46.108
Stay here.

13:47.777 --> 13:49.778
You know what?

13:49.779 --> 13:53.348
You are absolutely right, Ms. James.

13:53.349 --> 13:56.585
Of course I am.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.553
About which part?

13:58.554 --> 14:01.089
Ignorance is no longer an option for me.

14:01.090 --> 14:05.794
I need to know everything,
and I need to know it now.

14:05.795 --> 14:08.363
At this point, you're a way of life.

14:08.364 --> 14:09.931
People "keep it Brockmire."

14:09.932 --> 14:13.001
Yeah. I keep seeing pictures
of tattoos that say that.

14:13.002 --> 14:13.811
What is that?

14:13.860 --> 14:15.460
Yeah, well, Drake started it.

14:15.571 --> 14:18.473
"She was a 7, but I still
set her pussy on fire,

14:18.474 --> 14:20.141
You know your boy keep it Brockmire."

14:22.678 --> 14:24.412
B... You're a legend.

14:24.413 --> 14:29.284
Who care if it's because your
wife Lucy'd Bob Greenwald?

14:29.285 --> 14:31.087
I'm sorry, my wife what?

14:32.955 --> 14:35.957
Mnh.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.760
"Lucy'd" is slang

14:38.761 --> 14:43.164
for when a woman

14:43.165 --> 14:46.701
does a man in the butt.

14:59.348 --> 15:00.882
You want to get high?

15:00.883 --> 15:03.251
So I need stimulants to outrun

15:03.252 --> 15:04.986
the waves of depression

15:04.987 --> 15:08.089
currently approaching
high tide in my body.

15:08.090 --> 15:11.259
So we're chewing some khat here.

15:11.260 --> 15:13.896
This is a habit that
I picked up in Yemen.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.169
Are you bitching out on me?
Is that what you're doing?

15:19.196 --> 15:20.857
Psht.

15:22.638 --> 15:23.938
Just chew it up there.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.710
There you go.

15:28.711 --> 15:30.745
Son, I have a question for you.

15:30.792 --> 15:33.948
And I'd like you to,
uh, keep it Brockmire.

15:33.949 --> 15:35.684
Mm-hmm.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.819
You think I'm ever gonna
be remembered for anything

15:37.820 --> 15:42.023
except for the worst moments of my life?

15:42.024 --> 15:46.294
They got you on video, dude... Twice.

15:46.295 --> 15:48.997
You're Brutal Brockmire
till the day you die.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.752
Yeah, that's what I thought.

15:58.197 --> 15:59.831
You know, I don't feel anything.

16:00.004 --> 16:02.047
Oh, just give it time.

16:03.512 --> 16:05.613
Whoo! This is fun!

16:05.614 --> 16:06.715
Fun!

16:06.721 --> 16:08.321
Fu-u-u-u-un!

16:08.410 --> 16:11.453
Yeah, khat is somewhere
between 10 cups of coffee

16:11.454 --> 16:13.688
and very low-grade cocaine, so...

16:13.694 --> 16:15.851
It's my first time on a baseball field!

16:15.907 --> 16:17.507
Fun!

16:17.626 --> 16:19.294
How's that even possible?

16:19.295 --> 16:21.329
Because baseball is one
of those old-timey things

16:21.330 --> 16:24.566
you don't need anymore,
like cursive or e-mail!

16:25.568 --> 16:28.570
Stop! Right now. Freeze.

16:28.571 --> 16:31.373
It's August 16, 1920.

16:31.374 --> 16:33.074
Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians

16:33.075 --> 16:36.211
steps into the batter's box at
New York to face the Yankees.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.712
He looks out at the pitcher,

16:37.713 --> 16:40.243
but in the afternoon
light of the Polo Grounds,

16:40.290 --> 16:43.126
the infield is just
totally bathed in shadow.

16:43.386 --> 16:46.256
Pitcher wound up and
he delivered the ball,

16:46.351 --> 16:48.652
but that ball had
been rubbed and covered

16:48.653 --> 16:52.322
in tobacco and dirt,
hell, even some licorice,

16:52.323 --> 16:55.859
till it just exactly as
dark as the infield shadows

16:55.860 --> 16:58.200
that complete hid it from Ray Chapman.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.392
- Bam!
- Aah!

16:59.463 --> 17:01.864
Down he went! He got
hit right in the temple!

17:02.233 --> 17:03.267
Never saw it coming.

17:03.268 --> 17:05.502
He died right there,
right at home plate!

17:05.502 --> 17:08.438
W-Why... Why... Why
are you telling me this?

17:08.439 --> 17:10.391
I'm high and very fragile right now.

17:10.438 --> 17:15.045
Why would you tell me an awful
story in which some guy dies?!

17:15.046 --> 17:17.281
The thing is, was it awful, though?

17:17.281 --> 17:20.884
Think about it... Ray Chapman
spent his last moments on Earth

17:20.885 --> 17:26.290
playing a wonderful game
on a warm summer afternoon.

17:26.290 --> 17:29.459
And is there a better
way to go out than that?

17:33.197 --> 17:36.867
Well, that's just a waste of good khat.

17:44.008 --> 17:47.377
I'm really glad you decided to stay.

17:47.378 --> 17:49.088
Today's gonna be a big day.

17:49.140 --> 17:50.473
Oh, yes, indeed,

17:50.748 --> 17:54.017
'cause I decided to call
one final baseball game

17:54.018 --> 17:56.620
and then kill myself.

17:56.621 --> 17:59.223
Please give that suicide
note to Lucy after I'm gone.

18:04.662 --> 18:06.486
It just says you.

18:06.492 --> 18:09.634
She'll know what it's regardin'.

18:10.501 --> 18:12.520
All right, two outs now.

18:12.526 --> 18:14.434
Bottom of the eighth.
Or as I used to know it,

18:14.473 --> 18:16.762
the Gerry's Gelatin Home Run Inning.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.741
Let's go, Frackers!

18:18.742 --> 18:20.376
Hey, a fun fact, folks.

18:20.377 --> 18:23.779
Gelatin is made from the bones
of slaughtered cows and pigs,

18:23.780 --> 18:26.782
which are then crushed
and treatment with acids

18:26.783 --> 18:30.886
and chemicals until they reduce
to a fine collagen powder.

18:30.887 --> 18:33.822
Fastball just catches the
inside corner, 0 and 1.

18:33.823 --> 18:36.291
I ask you, Morristown,
what kind of a creature

18:36.292 --> 18:38.861
doesn't just kill its
prey, but then uses science

18:38.862 --> 18:41.030
to rob it of its very living essence?

18:41.031 --> 18:43.766
Stevens just misses with
a breaking ball outside.

18:43.767 --> 18:45.200
Count evens, 1 and 1.

18:45.201 --> 18:47.136
Make no mistake.

18:47.137 --> 18:49.638
There's nothing decent
about human beings, folks.

18:49.639 --> 18:52.541
No objective, definable form of good.

18:52.542 --> 18:53.842
Not really a soul.

18:53.843 --> 18:55.878
More like the absence of a soul.

18:55.879 --> 19:01.083
Juuuuuuuust blackness.

19:01.084 --> 19:05.454
So, if you want to stare into
the gaping yawn of oblivion,

19:05.455 --> 19:06.755
don't look up to the heavens.

19:06.756 --> 19:07.890
No, no.

19:07.891 --> 19:09.825
Just look squarely into the mirror.

19:09.826 --> 19:11.660
Strike 3!

19:11.661 --> 19:13.128
Strike 3 called, and
that'll end the eighth.

19:13.129 --> 19:14.763
What the hell was that, Brockmire?!

19:14.764 --> 19:15.899
I'm trying to focus here!

19:18.935 --> 19:20.769
Enough of the kid glove shit, okay?

19:20.770 --> 19:23.305
So, boo-hoo, your wife
Lucy'd your neighbor.

19:23.306 --> 19:24.706
That's just a word everybody uses?

19:24.707 --> 19:26.508
Babies, grandmas, just everybody?

19:26.509 --> 19:30.379
Personally, when I stare into
the gaping yawn of oblivion,

19:30.380 --> 19:31.680
or whatever you were talking about,

19:31.681 --> 19:33.182
I ball my fists and take a swing!

19:33.183 --> 19:34.316
Well, hey, good for you.

19:34.317 --> 19:36.085
If you're gonna eat a bullet, so be it.

19:36.086 --> 19:37.286
Nobody here's gonna stop you.

19:37.287 --> 19:38.587
Well, no, no, no. I love naps,

19:38.588 --> 19:40.756
so it's pills with a
bag over my head for me.

19:40.757 --> 19:43.158
Might even draw a little
smiley face on the bag,

19:43.159 --> 19:45.194
add a sense of whimsy
to the proceedings.

19:45.195 --> 19:47.162
Whatever way you want
to do it, sounds great.

19:47.163 --> 19:49.698
But if you go, you're gonna
miss a hell of a season.

19:49.699 --> 19:51.700
Darling, I have seen enough baseball

19:51.701 --> 19:53.302
to last me 100 lifetimes.

19:53.303 --> 19:56.406
"Darling," you've never
seen anything like this.

20:00.009 --> 20:01.276
All right.

20:01.277 --> 20:02.878
Stepping in to pinch-hit now

20:02.879 --> 20:05.981
for the Frackers is
former competitive eater,

20:05.982 --> 20:07.449
Fatty Boombalatty.

20:07.450 --> 20:09.885
That's right, I said Fatty Boombalatty.

20:09.886 --> 20:11.820
And at 400 pounds,

20:11.821 --> 20:13.755
he is officially the fattest player

20:13.756 --> 20:15.057
in the history of baseball.

20:15.058 --> 20:16.825
Folks, that's no small feat

20:16.826 --> 20:18.193
because fat guys have
been a part of this game

20:18.194 --> 20:19.061
from the beginning.

20:19.062 --> 20:20.429
Babe Ruth himself,

20:20.430 --> 20:22.097
the very greatest of the greats,

20:22.098 --> 20:24.333
was also a big, fat piece of shit,

20:24.334 --> 20:27.970
so wonderful bit of history
we are looking at here.

20:27.971 --> 20:29.906
Ah, here comes the pitch.

20:31.574 --> 20:32.975
Whew! Ouch.

20:32.976 --> 20:34.810
Well, that was nothing
if not predictable.

20:34.811 --> 20:36.645
And as he makes his way to first,

20:36.646 --> 20:39.481
stepping in now for the
Frackers is who I believe to be

20:39.482 --> 20:42.217
the second-fattest man in
the history of baseball,

20:42.218 --> 20:45.821
former long-haul trucker
and gout survivor.

20:45.822 --> 20:47.289
Mr. Doug Romero.

20:47.290 --> 20:51.226
Ohh! That was fast.

20:51.227 --> 20:55.665
Okay. Two on now, and folks, see
if you can sense a pattern here.

20:56.232 --> 20:58.300
Oh, shit!

20:58.301 --> 21:00.335
Ooh, that one had some
anger behind it, didn't it?

21:00.336 --> 21:04.706
All right. Bases loaded
as Pedro Uribe steps in.

21:06.276 --> 21:08.143
Uribe during his time in the big leagues

21:08.144 --> 21:10.554
was known as "The Grand Slam King."

21:10.616 --> 21:13.315
Frackers have used some
pretty ingenious gamesmanship

21:13.316 --> 21:14.483
to load the bases.

21:14.484 --> 21:16.518
Let's see if they can
do anything with it.

21:16.519 --> 21:20.589
Hello, baby.

21:20.590 --> 21:22.157
Here comes the pitch.

21:22.158 --> 21:24.561
- Pedro!
- Bring it home, Pedro!

21:27.197 --> 21:30.532
Oh, folks, that ball cannot
be buried in a Jewish cemetery

21:30.533 --> 21:34.303
because it just got tattooed!

21:34.304 --> 21:36.972
Oh, man!

21:36.973 --> 21:41.610
$1,000 worth of cured Italian meat.

21:41.611 --> 21:43.178
A grand salami!

21:43.179 --> 21:48.383
Pedro Uribe cuts the
lead to only eight runs.

21:48.384 --> 21:50.018
Score is 12 to 4.

21:55.892 --> 21:58.393
I suppose you have more of
that kind of stuff planned?

21:58.394 --> 22:02.497
Every game.

22:02.498 --> 22:05.301
I want top-shelf liquor
included in my free drinks.

22:07.437 --> 22:09.205
Monday through Thursday.

22:14.477 --> 22:15.811
Ah, it. I'm in.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.279
Yes!

22:17.280 --> 22:19.381
Yeah! Okay, for now.

22:19.382 --> 22:21.583
I'm also pretty shitfaced,

22:21.584 --> 22:25.153
so best to take everything I say
with a big, fat grain of salt.

22:25.154 --> 22:27.222
Please tell me you got
that home run on video.

22:27.223 --> 22:29.891
Oh, psht.

22:29.892 --> 22:33.314
- Yes.
- Now here's

22:33.759 --> 22:35.063
a minor league clip a viewer sent in.

22:35.064 --> 22:36.898
A home run estimated to have traveled

22:36.899 --> 22:39.101
an impressive 580 feet.

22:39.102 --> 22:40.669
But check out the elephant parade

22:40.670 --> 22:42.671
running around the bases.

22:42.672 --> 22:45.741
$1,000 worth of cured Italian meat.

22:45.742 --> 22:48.977
- Jimmy?
- A grand salami! Pedro Uribe

22:48.978 --> 22:51.380
- cuts the lead to only eight runs.
- You're still alive?

22:53.082 --> 22:56.518
Frackers fans just found a
prize in the Cracker Jack box

22:56.519 --> 22:59.122
in the form of a bunch of fat men.

22:59.275 --> 23:03.341
