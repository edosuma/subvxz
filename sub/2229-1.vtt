WEBVTT

02:47.620 --> 02:49.620
Did you hear that?

02:49.710 --> 02:52.500
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.170
This is madness.

03:04.180 --> 03:05.640
We're doomed.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.270
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.070
What's that?

04:57.380 --> 04:59.880
R2-D2, where are you?

05:16.440 --> 05:18.900
At last. Where have you been?

05:18.980 --> 05:22.110
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

05:22.190 --> 05:25.490
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines
or smashed into who knows what.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.700
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

05:41.460 --> 05:44.510
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.220
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

05:47.300 --> 05:50.140
What have you done with those plans?

05:50.220 --> 05:52.220
We intercepted no transmissions.

05:53.180 --> 05:57.190
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

05:57.270 --> 06:01.900
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

06:05.320 --> 06:08.860
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

06:08.950 --> 06:11.910
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

06:24.380 --> 06:25.920
There's one. Set for stun.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.310
She'll be all right.

06:33.390 --> 06:35.310
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

06:36.890 --> 06:39.390
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.440
You'll be deactivated for sure.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.030
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

06:46.110 --> 06:47.780
Come out, before somebody sees you.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.370
Secret mission? What plans?

06:52.450 --> 06:55.080
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

06:58.410 --> 07:00.670
I'm going to regret this.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.130
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

07:11.220 --> 07:12.550
It must have short-circuited.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.970
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

07:18.310 --> 07:20.310
Are you sure this thing is safe?

07:39.250 --> 07:41.750
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

07:41.830 --> 07:45.460
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic--

07:45.540 --> 07:47.630
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

07:47.710 --> 07:49.630
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.840
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

07:53.930 --> 07:56.810
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

07:56.890 --> 07:58.930
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:59.020 --> 08:02.020
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.980
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

08:05.060 --> 08:07.020
Take her away!

08:11.360 --> 08:12.860
Holding her is dangerous.

08:12.950 --> 08:16.490
If word of this gets out, it could generate
sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.950
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.750
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.750
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

08:23.830 --> 08:25.500
Leave that to me.

08:25.580 --> 08:29.090
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

08:29.170 --> 08:32.299
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

08:32.380 --> 08:33.840
and no transmissions were made.

08:33.929 --> 08:38.140
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting,
but no life-forms were aboard.

08:38.220 --> 08:41.230
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

08:41.309 --> 08:44.900
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

08:44.980 --> 08:47.060
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

08:47.150 --> 08:48.730
Yes, sir.

09:03.250 --> 09:05.330
How did we get into this mess?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.790
I really don't know how.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.760
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

09:14.340 --> 09:17.970
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

09:24.980 --> 09:27.060
What a desolate place this is.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.240
Where do you think you're going?

09:33.320 --> 09:34.820
Well, I'm not going that way.

09:35.610 --> 09:37.110
It's much too rocky.

09:37.700 --> 09:39.620
This way is much easier.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.120
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

09:43.870 --> 09:45.620
Don't get technical with me.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.960
What mission? What are you talking about?

09:50.840 --> 09:53.380
I've just about had enough of you.

09:54.090 --> 09:55.420
Go that way.

09:55.510 --> 09:58.340
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

09:59.050 --> 10:01.100
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

10:01.180 --> 10:02.680
because you won't get it.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.860
No more adventures.

10:18.950 --> 10:20.950
I'm not going that way.

10:54.860 --> 10:57.860
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

10:58.860 --> 11:01.070
He tricked me into going this way...

11:01.160 --> 11:03.080
but he'll do no better.

11:06.330 --> 11:08.460
Wait. What's that?

11:08.540 --> 11:11.290
A transport. I'm saved.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.130
Over here!

11:13.210 --> 11:15.840
Hey! Hey!

11:15.920 --> 11:19.380
Help! Please help!

14:49.890 --> 14:50.890
R2?

14:55.100 --> 14:58.690
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

15:32.260 --> 15:35.470
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

15:36.470 --> 15:38.430
Look, sir. Droids.

15:52.820 --> 15:54.410
We stopped.

15:54.490 --> 15:56.290
Wake up. Wake up!

16:03.210 --> 16:04.840
We're doomed.

16:12.630 --> 16:14.140
Do you think they'll melt us down?

16:27.900 --> 16:30.110
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.700
Will this never end?

17:11.940 --> 17:14.530
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

17:14.609 --> 17:16.109
Luke!

17:19.540 --> 17:24.619
Luke, tell your uncle if he gets a translator,
be sure it speaks Bocce.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.250
Doesn't look like we have much choice,
but I'll remind him.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.560
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.600
No, not that one.

17:44.390 --> 17:47.350
You. I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

17:47.440 --> 17:51.440
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs--

17:51.530 --> 17:54.860
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

17:54.950 --> 17:57.700
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed--

17:57.780 --> 18:01.830
I need a droid who understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.

18:01.910 --> 18:05.210
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

18:05.290 --> 18:07.460
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

18:07.540 --> 18:11.090
- Can you speak Bocce?
- Of course. It's like a second language.

18:11.170 --> 18:13.380
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

18:13.460 --> 18:14.670
Luke!

18:17.130 --> 18:19.800
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.810
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

18:22.890 --> 18:25.140
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.810
Now come on. Get to it.

18:28.850 --> 18:30.110
All right. Come on.

18:32.770 --> 18:34.480
And the red one. Come on.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.700
Come on, red. Let's go.

18:57.340 --> 18:59.510
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

18:59.590 --> 19:02.350
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

19:02.430 --> 19:04.850
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

19:07.850 --> 19:12.810
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.820
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

19:14.900 --> 19:17.440
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

19:18.780 --> 19:19.990
Take this away.

19:20.070 --> 19:21.660
You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

19:21.740 --> 19:24.660
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.

19:24.740 --> 19:25.740
Here he comes.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.380
Okay. Let's go.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.210
Don't you forget this.

19:33.290 --> 19:36.800
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

19:42.970 --> 19:46.220
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.310
I've got such a bad case of dust contamination,
I can barely move.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.020
It just isn't fair.

19:53.110 --> 19:55.860
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.490
Is there anything I might do to help?

19:58.570 --> 20:01.780
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest...

20:01.860 --> 20:03.530
or teleport me off this rock.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.200
I don't think so, sir.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.330
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable
about such things.

20:08.410 --> 20:10.330
Not on this planet, anyway.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.830
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.040
Well, if there's a bright center
to the universe...

20:16.130 --> 20:18.380
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.420
I see, sir.

20:21.090 --> 20:23.510
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

20:24.930 --> 20:26.390
Just Luke.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.230
And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

20:30.310 --> 20:32.980
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

20:33.060 --> 20:34.100
Hello.

20:35.770 --> 20:39.230
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.530
With all we've been through...

20:40.610 --> 20:42.860
sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are...

20:42.950 --> 20:44.620
what with the rebellion and all.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.660
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

20:46.740 --> 20:49.580
That's how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.580
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

20:52.660 --> 20:54.580
There's not much to tell.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.250
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.880
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

21:01.590 --> 21:03.510
Well, my little friend...

21:03.590 --> 21:05.680
you got something jammed
in here real good.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.260
Were you on a Starcruiser or--

21:08.100 --> 21:11.180
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.890
What's this?

21:12.980 --> 21:16.100
"What is what"?
He asked you a question. What is that?

21:16.190 --> 21:27.490
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

21:29.620 --> 21:32.000
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.410
Old data. Pay it no mind.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.580
Who is she? She's beautiful.

21:36.670 --> 21:40.050
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

21:40.130 --> 21:42.300
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

21:42.380 --> 21:44.380
A person of some importance, I believe.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.890
- Our captain was--
- Is there any more to this recording?

21:48.890 --> 21:52.220
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

21:52.310 --> 21:55.100
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.850
You're my only hope.

21:58.520 --> 22:02.860
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi,
a resident of these parts...

22:02.940 --> 22:04.740
and it's a private message for him.

22:04.820 --> 22:06.860
Frankly, I don't know
what he's talking about.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.950
Our last master was Captain Antilles.

22:09.030 --> 22:13.700
But with all we've been through,
this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

22:13.790 --> 22:16.960
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.710
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

22:19.790 --> 22:22.250
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan...

22:23.050 --> 22:25.220
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.090
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

22:28.300 --> 22:30.220
I wonder who she is.

22:30.300 --> 22:33.220
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

22:36.940 --> 22:40.270
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

22:40.360 --> 22:43.190
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

22:43.280 --> 22:46.030
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

22:46.110 --> 22:48.240
Oh, yeah. Well...

22:48.320 --> 22:51.830
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

22:51.910 --> 22:53.120
Okay.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.620
There you go.

22:59.170 --> 23:02.500
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

23:02.590 --> 23:03.590
"What message"?

23:04.710 --> 23:06.010
The one you've just been playing.

23:06.090 --> 23:08.260
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

23:08.340 --> 23:10.680
Luke! Luke!

23:10.760 --> 23:13.010
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

23:13.100 --> 23:16.230
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

23:16.310 --> 23:19.770
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

23:22.440 --> 23:25.280
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.240
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

23:28.860 --> 23:31.280
No, I don't like you either.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.840
- I think that R2 unit might have been stolen.
- What makes you think that?

23:43.920 --> 23:46.880
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.470
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

23:52.260 --> 23:55.350
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

23:57.430 --> 23:59.640
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.520
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

24:03.060 --> 24:06.530
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to Anchorhead
and have its memory erased.

24:06.610 --> 24:08.690
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.070
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

24:13.160 --> 24:14.280
He won't.

24:15.620 --> 24:19.250
I don't think he exists anymore.
He died about the same time as your father.

24:19.330 --> 24:22.460
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

24:23.580 --> 24:26.590
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

24:27.250 --> 24:30.630
In the morning, I want them on the south ridge,
working on those condensers.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.800
Yes, sir.

24:33.930 --> 24:36.640
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

24:36.720 --> 24:40.100
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement--

24:40.180 --> 24:41.980
about me staying on another season.

24:44.350 --> 24:47.690
If these new droids work out,
I want to apply to the academy this year.

24:48.610 --> 24:50.530
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

24:50.610 --> 24:52.450
Sure. There's more than enough droids.

24:52.530 --> 24:54.570
Harvest is when I need you the most.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.700
It's only one season more.

24:56.780 --> 24:59.950
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest to hire more hands...

25:00.040 --> 25:02.330
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

25:03.250 --> 25:05.290
You must understand I need you here, Luke.

25:05.380 --> 25:08.300
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

25:08.380 --> 25:10.460
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

25:10.550 --> 25:13.050
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

25:13.130 --> 25:14.930
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.

25:15.010 --> 25:18.390
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

25:18.470 --> 25:20.520
It means so much to him.

25:21.180 --> 25:23.600
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.

25:25.310 --> 25:29.230
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.530
That's what I'm afraid of.

26:20.700 --> 26:23.870
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.750
Please don't deactivate me.

26:25.830 --> 26:28.500
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

26:28.580 --> 26:31.800
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

26:40.300 --> 26:42.680
That R2 unit has always been a problem.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.390
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.

26:45.480 --> 26:47.730
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

26:47.810 --> 26:50.520
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

26:50.610 --> 26:51.570
Blast it!

26:51.650 --> 26:54.280
Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?

26:54.360 --> 26:57.570
It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople around.
We'll have to wait till morning.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.660
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.

26:59.740 --> 27:01.700
I'll be there in a few minutes.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.870
Boy, am I gonna get it.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.960
That little droid's gonna cause me
a lot of trouble.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.000
He excels at that, sir.

27:10.130 --> 27:11.630
Come on.

27:31.690 --> 27:33.610
Have you seen Luke this morning?

27:33.690 --> 27:37.110
He said he had things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

27:37.190 --> 27:40.280
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

27:40.950 --> 27:43.780
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday...

27:43.870 --> 27:45.540
or there'll be hell to pay.

27:46.540 --> 27:49.120
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

27:49.210 --> 27:52.210
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

28:14.650 --> 28:16.690
Where do you think you're going?

28:17.610 --> 28:19.530
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.610
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

28:23.780 --> 28:25.450
Don't talk to me of your mission either.

28:25.530 --> 28:28.660
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.790
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.420
What's wrong with him now?

28:34.290 --> 28:36.590
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

28:37.210 --> 28:39.260
Sandpeople. Or worse.

28:41.260 --> 28:42.840
Come on. Let's go have a look.

28:42.930 --> 28:43.930
Come on.

28:46.640 --> 28:50.390
Well, there are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any--

28:50.480 --> 28:52.270
Wait a second.

28:52.350 --> 28:55.230
They're Sandpeople, all right.
I can see one of them now.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.060
Hello there.

30:13.430 --> 30:16.730
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.190
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.910
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

30:30.740 --> 30:33.700
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.170
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

30:39.250 --> 30:41.250
Boy, am I glad to see you.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.380
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be traveled lightly.

30:47.590 --> 30:51.100
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.430
This little droid.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.060
I think he's searching for his former master...

30:57.140 --> 30:59.270
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid before.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.440
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.150
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

31:08.700 --> 31:10.370
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

31:12.740 --> 31:14.240
Obi-Wan.

31:15.160 --> 31:19.170
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.750
A long time.

31:22.920 --> 31:25.840
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.630
He's not dead.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.930
Not yet.

31:29.010 --> 31:32.010
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.470
He's me.

31:36.180 --> 31:39.440
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

31:39.520 --> 31:42.190
since, oh, before you were born.

31:42.270 --> 31:43.900
Then the droid does belong to you.

31:43.980 --> 31:46.650
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

31:48.490 --> 31:49.990
Very interesting.

31:52.030 --> 31:53.950
I think we better get indoors.

31:54.620 --> 31:57.330
The Sandpeople are easily startled...

31:57.410 --> 32:00.250
but they'll soon be back--
and in greater numbers.

32:03.210 --> 32:04.460
3PO.

32:13.850 --> 32:16.520
Where am I? I must have taken a bad step.

32:17.980 --> 32:21.230
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

32:21.310 --> 32:24.060
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

32:24.150 --> 32:28.190
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account. I'm done for.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.160
No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?

32:31.240 --> 32:33.160
Quickly. They're on the move.

32:38.450 --> 32:41.830
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

32:41.920 --> 32:45.670
That's what your uncle told you.
He didn't hold with your father's ideals.

32:45.750 --> 32:48.880
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

32:49.590 --> 32:51.930
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

32:52.010 --> 32:55.680
I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.

32:58.220 --> 32:59.980
I wish I'd known him.

33:00.060 --> 33:02.810
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

33:03.690 --> 33:05.610
and a cunning warrior.

33:05.690 --> 33:08.230
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

33:10.440 --> 33:12.240
And he was a good friend.

33:13.410 --> 33:14.410
Which reminds me...

33:15.620 --> 33:17.620
I have something here for you.

33:19.620 --> 33:22.250
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

33:22.330 --> 33:25.040
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

33:25.880 --> 33:28.000
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan...

33:28.090 --> 33:31.550
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

33:31.630 --> 33:34.590
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.260
Sure. Go ahead.

33:38.930 --> 33:42.350
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.730
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

33:45.810 --> 33:48.650
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

33:49.650 --> 33:51.900
An elegant weapon...

33:51.990 --> 33:54.990
for a more civilized age.

33:56.870 --> 33:59.240
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights...

33:59.330 --> 34:03.290
were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic...

34:03.370 --> 34:06.120
before the dark times...

34:06.210 --> 34:07.920
before the Empire.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.880
How did my father die?

34:15.340 --> 34:17.889
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

34:17.969 --> 34:20.560
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

34:21.310 --> 34:24.639
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.900
He betrayed and murdered your father.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.940
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

34:34.150 --> 34:37.909
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

34:37.989 --> 34:39.580
The Force?

34:40.870 --> 34:43.330
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.540
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

34:46.620 --> 34:49.210
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

34:49.290 --> 34:51.340
It binds the galaxy together.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.970
Let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...

35:02.220 --> 35:04.310
and where you come from.

35:04.390 --> 35:07.560
- I saw part of a message--
- I seem to have found it.

35:07.640 --> 35:11.980
General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.

35:12.070 --> 35:15.530
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.

35:15.610 --> 35:18.740
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.

35:18.820 --> 35:20.700
But my ship has fallen under attack...

35:20.780 --> 35:23.080
and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

35:23.160 --> 35:26.460
I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion...

35:26.540 --> 35:28.620
into the memory systems of this R2 unit.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.540
My father will know how to retrieve it.

35:31.340 --> 35:34.510
You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

35:35.340 --> 35:36.840
This is our most desperate hour.

35:37.840 --> 35:40.970
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

35:55.900 --> 35:59.990
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

36:00.070 --> 36:01.530
Alderaan?

36:01.620 --> 36:03.490
I'm not going to Alderaan.

36:03.580 --> 36:05.950
I've gotta get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.

36:06.040 --> 36:08.460
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

36:08.540 --> 36:11.710
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.680
I can't get involved. I've got work to do.

36:20.470 --> 36:22.300
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

36:22.390 --> 36:24.970
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

36:26.470 --> 36:29.980
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

36:30.060 --> 36:33.940
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

36:34.020 --> 36:35.730
Learn about the Force, Luke.

36:42.910 --> 36:45.120
I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

36:45.780 --> 36:49.200
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

36:50.410 --> 36:53.420
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

37:00.970 --> 37:04.600
Until this battle station is fully operational,
we are vulnerable.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.850
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.

37:06.930 --> 37:08.850
They're more dangerous than you realize.

37:08.930 --> 37:11.850
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander...

37:11.940 --> 37:13.650
not to this battle station.

37:13.730 --> 37:17.360
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate--

37:17.440 --> 37:21.150
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

37:21.900 --> 37:26.030
I've just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

37:26.120 --> 37:29.790
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

37:30.450 --> 37:31.870
That's impossible.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.250
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

37:34.330 --> 37:38.880
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

37:39.590 --> 37:43.260
Fear will keep the local systems in line.

37:43.340 --> 37:45.470
Fear of this battle station.

37:45.550 --> 37:46.720
And what of the rebellion?

37:46.800 --> 37:50.060
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

37:50.140 --> 37:52.100
it is possible, however unlikely...

37:52.180 --> 37:54.310
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

37:55.060 --> 37:58.650
The plans you refer to
will soon be back in our hands.

37:58.730 --> 38:03.030
Any attack by the rebels against this
station would be a useless gesture...

38:03.110 --> 38:05.110
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

38:05.200 --> 38:08.830
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

38:09.580 --> 38:11.250
I suggest we use it.

38:11.330 --> 38:15.580
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

38:15.670 --> 38:19.090
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant...

38:19.170 --> 38:21.000
next to the power of the Force.

38:21.090 --> 38:24.550
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

38:24.630 --> 38:27.300
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

38:27.390 --> 38:30.180
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

38:30.260 --> 38:34.350
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress--

38:41.570 --> 38:44.190
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.030
Enough of this. Vader, release him.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.580
As you wish.

38:51.790 --> 38:53.870
This bickering is pointless.

38:55.040 --> 38:58.750
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

38:58.830 --> 39:00.920
by the time this station is operational.

39:01.590 --> 39:04.760
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

39:12.720 --> 39:16.310
It looks like the Sandpeople did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

39:16.390 --> 39:18.730
I've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

39:18.810 --> 39:22.150
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

39:22.230 --> 39:24.150
These tracks are side-by-side.

39:24.230 --> 39:28.410
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

39:28.490 --> 39:31.370
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

39:31.450 --> 39:35.660
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sandpeople.

39:36.330 --> 39:40.250
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

39:40.330 --> 39:42.880
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

39:48.300 --> 39:51.300
If they traced the robots here,
they may have learned who they sold them to...

39:51.390 --> 39:53.390
and that would lead them back... home.

39:53.470 --> 39:54.770
Wait, Luke.

39:54.850 --> 39:56.850
It's too dangerous.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.840
Uncle Owen.

40:22.920 --> 40:23.920
Aunt Beru.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.170
Uncle Owen.

41:16.470 --> 41:22.060
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

42:05.060 --> 42:07.400
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

42:08.230 --> 42:10.150
You'd have been killed too...

42:10.230 --> 42:12.950
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

42:14.740 --> 42:16.740
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

42:17.490 --> 42:19.490
There's nothing for me here now.

42:19.580 --> 42:22.580
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

42:38.300 --> 42:40.640
Mos Eisley spaceport.

42:40.720 --> 42:45.520
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

42:46.440 --> 42:47.980
We must be cautious.

43:29.310 --> 43:31.230
How long have you had these droids?

43:31.320 --> 43:34.490
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

43:34.570 --> 43:36.490
Let me see your identification.

43:37.360 --> 43:39.870
You don't need to see his identification.

43:40.490 --> 43:42.330
We don't need to see his identification.

43:42.410 --> 43:44.950
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.000
These aren't the droids we're looking for.

43:48.170 --> 43:50.540
He can go about his business.

43:50.630 --> 43:53.880
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

43:53.960 --> 43:56.550
Move along. Move along.

44:12.860 --> 44:16.030
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.

44:17.030 --> 44:18.530
Go on, go on.

44:20.320 --> 44:23.580
I can't understand how we got by those troops.
I thought we were dead.

44:23.660 --> 44:28.000
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

44:31.380 --> 44:34.340
You really think we're gonna find
a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?

44:34.420 --> 44:37.380
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

44:37.460 --> 44:41.300
Only watch your step--
this place can be a little rough.

44:41.390 --> 44:43.140
I'm ready for anything.

44:47.060 --> 44:48.390
Come along, R2.

45:38.940 --> 45:42.450
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

45:42.530 --> 45:45.490
Your droids-- they'll have to wait outside.
We don't want them here.

45:45.570 --> 45:48.040
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.120
I heartily agree with you, sir.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.260
I'll have one of those.

46:36.460 --> 46:39.170
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

46:41.170 --> 46:44.720
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

46:44.800 --> 46:49.390
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

46:49.470 --> 46:52.310
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead!

46:52.390 --> 46:54.350
This little one's not worth the effort.

46:55.520 --> 46:56.690
Come, let me get you something.

47:24.340 --> 47:25.840
I'm all right.

47:27.630 --> 47:31.720
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.690
I don't like the look of this.

47:53.490 --> 47:57.080
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.

47:57.160 --> 48:00.380
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

48:00.460 --> 48:02.790
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

48:02.880 --> 48:06.670
Fast ship? You've never heard of
the Millennium Falcon?

48:06.760 --> 48:08.380
Should I have?

48:08.470 --> 48:11.640
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

48:13.640 --> 48:15.930
I've outrun imperial starships.

48:16.020 --> 48:18.020
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

48:18.100 --> 48:20.270
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

48:22.060 --> 48:24.110
She's fast enough for you, old man.

48:25.150 --> 48:28.070
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers--

48:28.150 --> 48:30.990
myself, the boy, two droids...

48:32.120 --> 48:34.080
and no questions asked.

48:35.290 --> 48:37.160
Is it some kind of local trouble?

48:37.250 --> 48:42.460
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

48:43.880 --> 48:46.630
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

48:46.710 --> 48:48.670
And it's gonna cost you something extra.

48:50.470 --> 48:52.260
10,000, all in advance.

48:53.970 --> 48:55.310
10,000?

48:56.560 --> 48:59.140
We could almost buy our own ship for that.

48:59.230 --> 49:01.480
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

49:01.560 --> 49:03.650
You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot.

49:03.730 --> 49:06.150
We don't have to sit here and listen--

49:06.230 --> 49:09.110
We can pay you 2,000 now...

49:09.190 --> 49:12.490
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

49:13.240 --> 49:14.450
Seventeen?

49:18.120 --> 49:20.410
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

49:20.500 --> 49:23.000
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

49:23.080 --> 49:24.290
Ninety-four.

49:25.840 --> 49:29.340
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

49:30.840 --> 49:33.010
All right. We'll check it out.

49:44.860 --> 49:48.320
17,000. Those guys
must really be desperate.

49:48.400 --> 49:51.860
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

49:52.950 --> 49:54.990
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

49:55.070 --> 49:57.120
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

49:58.490 --> 50:00.540
Going somewhere, Solo?

50:00.790 --> 50:03.790
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

50:03.870 --> 50:06.130
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

50:06.210 --> 50:08.130
It's too late.

50:08.210 --> 50:10.630
You should have paid him when you had the chance.

50:10.710 --> 50:12.840
Jabba's put a price on your head so large

50:12.930 --> 50:15.640
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you...

50:17.300 --> 50:19.310
I'm lucky I found you first.

50:19.390 --> 50:21.600
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

50:21.680 --> 50:25.270
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.

50:25.350 --> 50:28.520
I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba--

50:28.570 --> 50:30.320
Jabba's through with you.

50:31.490 --> 50:33.780
He has no time for smugglers

50:34.110 --> 50:38.200
who drop their shipments at the first
sign of an Imperial cruiser.

50:36.740 --> 50:40.490
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

50:40.580 --> 50:44.710
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

50:44.790 --> 50:46.920
Over my dead body.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.130
That's the idea.

50:48.500 --> 50:52.210
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

50:52.420 --> 50:53.760
I'll bet you have.

51:07.810 --> 51:09.440
Sorry about the mess.

51:18.820 --> 51:21.870
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

51:21.950 --> 51:25.370
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

51:25.460 --> 51:29.040
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

51:29.130 --> 51:31.380
What course shall we set?

51:31.460 --> 51:34.880
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

51:34.970 --> 51:36.590
What do you mean?

51:36.680 --> 51:39.640
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

51:39.720 --> 51:42.220
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

51:43.390 --> 51:45.430
Lock the door, R2.

51:47.520 --> 51:49.520
Check this side of the street.

51:53.690 --> 51:56.320
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

52:03.160 --> 52:05.870
I would much rather have gone with Master Luke
than stay here with you.

52:06.620 --> 52:10.080
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

52:10.830 --> 52:12.420
You watch your language.

52:14.460 --> 52:17.010
All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.

52:17.840 --> 52:21.430
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

52:21.510 --> 52:23.510
It'll be enough.

52:41.740 --> 52:46.160
Solo, come out of there, Solo!

52:46.290 --> 52:48.290
Right here, Jabba.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.040
I've been waitin' for you.

52:51.460 --> 52:53.340
Have you now.

52:54.210 --> 52:56.340
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

52:57.710 --> 53:01.430
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

53:02.050 --> 53:04.180
Why haven't you paid me...

53:04.510 --> 53:07.100
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

53:07.980 --> 53:10.730
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me,
come see me yourself.

53:10.810 --> 53:12.190
Don't send one of these twerps.

53:12.230 --> 53:15.610
Han, I can't make exceptions.

53:15.940 --> 53:18.610
What if everyone who smuggled for me

53:18.900 --> 53:21.200
dropped their cargo at the first sign

53:21.610 --> 53:23.910
of an Imperial starship?

53:24.450 --> 53:26.330
It's not good business.

53:26.370 --> 53:29.790
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.

53:31.040 --> 53:33.500
You think I had a choice?

53:33.580 --> 53:35.380
But I got a nice, easy charter.

53:35.460 --> 53:39.510
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

53:39.590 --> 53:44.390
Han, my boy, you're the best.

53:45.010 --> 53:47.510
So, for an extra twenty percent...

53:47.760 --> 53:49.770
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.

53:50.100 --> 53:51.730
Okay, fifteen percent.

53:51.980 --> 53:53.730
But, if you fail me again...

53:54.190 --> 53:56.900
I'll put a price on your head so big,

53:57.270 --> 54:00.990
you won't be able to go near a civilized system.

54:01.610 --> 54:04.410
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.

54:05.950 --> 54:06.740
Come on!

54:12.960 --> 54:16.670
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.280
What a piece of junk.

54:42.360 --> 54:44.910
She'll make .5 past light speed.

54:44.990 --> 54:47.780
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

54:47.870 --> 54:50.870
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

54:50.950 --> 54:54.870
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

54:59.460 --> 55:00.960
Hello, sir.

55:09.890 --> 55:11.140
Which way?

55:13.140 --> 55:15.140
All right, men, load your weapons.

55:16.730 --> 55:19.360
Stop that ship. Blast them.

55:29.160 --> 55:31.160
Chewie, get us out of here!

55:32.580 --> 55:36.170
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

55:54.980 --> 55:58.150
Looks like an imperial cruiser.
Our passengers are hotter than I thought.

55:58.230 --> 55:59.650
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields...

55:59.730 --> 56:01.860
while I make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.

56:12.620 --> 56:15.500
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

56:15.580 --> 56:17.660
Why don't you outrun 'em?
You said this thing was fast.

56:17.750 --> 56:19.630
Watch your mouth or you're gonna
find yourself floating home.

56:19.710 --> 56:23.130
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

56:23.210 --> 56:25.090
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

56:29.180 --> 56:31.220
Here's where the fun begins.

56:31.300 --> 56:33.100
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

56:33.180 --> 56:36.100
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

56:36.180 --> 56:37.770
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

56:37.850 --> 56:40.900
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.

56:40.980 --> 56:43.440
Without precise calculations,
we'd fly right through a star...

56:43.520 --> 56:47.150
or bounce too close to a supernova,
and that would end your trip real quick.

56:47.240 --> 56:49.610
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.

56:49.700 --> 56:52.660
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

57:13.640 --> 57:15.970
We've entered the Alderaan system.

57:16.970 --> 57:20.940
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

57:21.020 --> 57:24.690
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

57:26.320 --> 57:28.240
Charming to the last.

57:28.900 --> 57:30.820
You don't know how hard I found it...

57:30.900 --> 57:32.820
signing the order to terminate your life.

57:32.910 --> 57:35.780
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

57:35.870 --> 57:39.040
Princess Leia, before your execution...

57:39.120 --> 57:41.330
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony...

57:41.420 --> 57:44.420
that will make
this battle station operational.

57:44.500 --> 57:47.340
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

57:48.010 --> 57:50.170
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin...

57:50.260 --> 57:52.930
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

57:53.010 --> 57:55.760
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

57:56.430 --> 57:59.890
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet...

57:59.980 --> 58:02.100
that'll be destroyed first.

58:02.190 --> 58:06.730
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

58:06.820 --> 58:09.610
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power...

58:09.690 --> 58:11.700
on your home planet of Alderaan.

58:12.700 --> 58:15.450
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.

58:15.530 --> 58:17.870
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

58:17.950 --> 58:20.200
Then name the system.

58:22.080 --> 58:25.460
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

58:26.340 --> 58:28.210
Where is the rebel base?

58:31.760 --> 58:33.380
Dantooine.

58:34.050 --> 58:35.840
They're on Dantooine.

58:35.930 --> 58:39.310
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

58:39.390 --> 58:42.270
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

58:42.350 --> 58:44.520
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

58:44.600 --> 58:47.060
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

58:47.150 --> 58:51.740
But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.

58:54.150 --> 58:56.240
Commence primary ignition.

59:19.600 --> 59:21.770
Are you all right? What's wrong?

59:23.180 --> 59:25.350
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...

59:25.440 --> 59:28.650
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror...

59:28.730 --> 59:30.690
and were suddenly silenced.

59:31.360 --> 59:33.440
I fear something terrible has happened.

59:35.110 --> 59:37.410
You'd better get on with your exercises.

59:39.950 --> 59:42.370
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

59:42.450 --> 59:44.450
I told you I'd outrun them.

59:48.420 --> 59:50.500
Don't everybody thank me at once.

59:50.590 --> 59:54.010
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.560
Now be careful, R2.

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:16.530
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:18.780
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:21.240
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:25.910
That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's arms
out of their sockets when they lose.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.210
Wookiees are known to do that.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.750
I see your point, sir.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.510
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:57.610
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.700
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.700
But it also obeys your commands.

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:12.170
Hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match for a blaster at your side, kid.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.550
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.800
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.800
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.140
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:25.600
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.810
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

01:01:29.890 --> 01:01:32.770
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:35.730
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:40.110
This time, let go your conscious self...

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:44.160
and act on instinct.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.700
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:51.250
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:02.970
Stretch out with your feelings.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.570
You see? You can do it.

01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:21.320
I call it luck.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.030
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:26.370
Good against remotes is one thing.

01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:29.450
Good against the living,
that's something else.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.580
We're coming up on Alderaan.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.630
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:43.130
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:49.890
Yes?

01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:51.980
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.980
They found the remains of a rebel base...

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:56.440
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.900
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.490
She lied. She lied to us.

01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:07.280
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.410
Terminate her immediately.

01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:16.460
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:20.300
What the--

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.590
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower...

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:27.090
some kind of asteroid collision.

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:29.510
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.930
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.270
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:36.190
It ain't there. It's been blown away.

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.980
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.280
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.940
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've--

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:47.740
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:49.160
It's an imperial fighter.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.790
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:56.040
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:02.050
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.260
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:07.720
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.810
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:17.560
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.560
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:24.940
He's heading for that small moon.

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:27.570
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.

01:04:29.070 --> 01:04:31.240
That's no moon.

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:34.700
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.460
I have a very bad feeling about this.

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:42.420
Turn the ship around.

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.760
Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:53.760
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.730
Why are we still moving towards it?

01:04:57.810 --> 01:04:59.650
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.400
There's gotta be something you can do.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.230
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.820
They're not gonna get me without a fight.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.950
You can't win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:32.720
Clear Bay 327.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.180
We are opening the magnetic field.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.700
To your stations. Come with me.

01:05:56.330 --> 01:05:59.750
Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:02.420
Yes?

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:05.500
We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:09.420
Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.

01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:13.340
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:16.510
She may yet be of some use to us.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:24.860
Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9. Release charge.

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.110
There's no one on board, sir.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.990
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.580
It must be a decoy.
Several escape pods have been jettisoned.

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:42.620
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:44.580
If there were any,
they must also have jettisoned.

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:48.170
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:49.510
Yes, sir.

01:06:49.590 --> 01:06:51.170
I sense something...

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:53.720
a presence I've not felt since--

01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:59.850
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:10.820
There's no one here.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.830
Boy, it's lucky you have
these compartments.

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:25.040
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.330
This is ridiculous.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:28.960
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.380
Leave that to me.

01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:33.510
Damn fool. I knew you were gonna say that.

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:37.090
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:50.360
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:53.440
All right. Let's go.

01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:10.130
Hey, down there.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.800
Could you give us a hand with this?

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.640
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:27.810
TK-421, do you copy?

01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:42.779
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:03.010
Between his howling
and your blasting everything...

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:05.140
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:08.520
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to sneakin' around.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.399
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:13.520
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:28.210
He's found the controls to the power beam
that's holding the ship here.

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:31.170
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:35.500
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:38.630
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:44.640
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.140
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:52.100
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:54.149
They must be delivered safely...

01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:57.440
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:00.860
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:06.410
The Force will be with you...

01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:07.910
always.

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.720
You said it, Chewie.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:22.220
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:24.850
Ben is a great man.

01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:27.890
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:31.020
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.440
Who do you think--

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.770
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.440
He says, "I've found her,"
and keeps repeating, "She's here."

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:42.150
Who? Who has he found?

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.990
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:46.780
- Princess?
- Where is she?

01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:48.790
Princess? What's going on?

01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:57.000
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.470
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:07.550
Oh, no. We've gotta do something.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.100
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.100
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:15.060
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:18.440
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.980
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:24.660
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.830
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:30.740
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.840
She's rich.

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.840
Rich?

01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:48.550
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be--

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.430
- What?
- Well, more well than you can imagine.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.520
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.690
- You'll get it.
- I better.

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:57.270
You will.

01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:59.820
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.900
- All right.
- What's your plan?

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.400
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:08.370
Okay.

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:10.990
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.330
Okay, Han, you put those on.

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:18.880
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.380
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.720
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:28.640
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.760
That isn't very reassuring.

01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:55.700
517 to scan control.
517 to scan control.

01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:24.440
I can't see a thing in this helmet.

01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:58.560
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.640
I did say so before.

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:18.830
Where are you taking this... thing?

01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:21.670
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.920
I wasn't notified.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I'll have to clear it.

01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:35.890
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.000
Look out.

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:14.010
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:16.300
Here it is-- 2187. You go and get her.

01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:18.390
I'll hold them here.

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.940
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.230
What happened?

01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:28.230
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.650
but everything's perfectly all right now.

01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:33.990
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:36.740
- How are you?
- We're sending a squad up.

01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.910
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:44.920
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.580
Who is this? What's your operating number?

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.470
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:09.650
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.530
Oh, the uniform.

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:16.030
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:19.160
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.200
- I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Ben Kenobi? Where is he?

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:22.370
Come on.

01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:27.580
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:31.670
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:35.590
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:38.140
Surely he must be dead by now.

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:40.640
Don't underestimate the Force.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:44.980
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:48.400
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

01:16:49.190 --> 01:16:50.400
Yes.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.980
We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.

01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:57.200
The princess? Put all sections on alert.

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.990
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:03.910
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:07.500
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.340
Get behind me. Get behind me.

01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:32.520
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

01:17:35.530 --> 01:17:38.450
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut off our only escape route.

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:41.070
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:45.790
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
- Yes, sir?

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:49.370
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.790
What was that? I didn't copy.

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.340
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

01:17:57.420 --> 01:17:59.970
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:02.300
All other information on your level
is restricted.

01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:04.970
Open up in there. Open up in there.

01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:07.640
Oh, no.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.350
There isn't any other way out.

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.110
I can't hold them off forever. Now what?

01:18:17.190 --> 01:18:20.740
This is some rescue. When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:22.870
He's the brains, sweetheart.

01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:24.700
Well, I didn't--

01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:29.370
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.380
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:41.880
Get in there!

01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:46.050
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:49.600
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.100
Wonderful girl.

01:18:55.230 --> 01:18:58.440
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:01.900
Get in there.

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:18.050
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

01:19:18.130 --> 01:19:20.590
What an incredible smell
you've discovered.

01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:25.390
Let's get out of here.

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:27.810
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.020
Forget it! I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:39.360
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.400
Absolutely, Your Worship.

01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:43.820
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:46.870
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:48.240
It could be worse.

01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:54.080
It's worse.

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:57.250
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

01:19:58.170 --> 01:20:00.130
Something just moved past my leg.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.880
- Look. Did you see that?
- What?

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:28.030
Kid! Luke!

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.550
Grab hold of this!

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:45.050
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:47.890
- Where?
- Anywhere!

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.130
Help him!

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:24.210
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:27.130
It just let go of me and disappeared.

01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:35.180
I got a bad feeling about this.

01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:44.440
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.

01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:54.950
Help me.

01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:09.340
Wait a minute.

01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:14.430
3PO! Come in, 3PO!

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.180
3PO!

01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:19.310
Where could he be?

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:25.690
Take over. See to him.

01:22:28.150 --> 01:22:29.650
Look, there.

01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:34.450
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:36.450
If you hurry, you might catch them.

01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:38.040
Follow me.

01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:43.790
You stand guard.

01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:49.340
Come on.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:00.930
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:04.150
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:05.810
All right.

01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:20.700
3PO. Come in, 3PO.

01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:22.080
3PO.

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:25.000
- Get on top.
- I can't.

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.000
Where could he be? 3PO.

01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:30.210
3PO, will you come in?

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.220
They aren't here.
Something must have happened to them.

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:35.510
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:42.770
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:47.400
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:56.110
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?

01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:00.990
"Use the comlink"? Oh, my.

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.040
I forgot. I turned it off.

01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:09.340
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:12.920
- We've had some problems.
- Shut up and listen to me.

01:24:13.010 --> 01:24:16.760
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:23.640
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

01:24:23.730 --> 01:24:26.480
No, shut them all down. Hurry! Oh, no.

01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:39.450
What?

01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:42.410
You did great, 3PO!

01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:44.870
Listen to them. They're dying, R2.

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.960
Curse my metal body. I wasn't fast enough.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:50.340
It's all my fault. My poor master.

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:52.000
We're all right. You did great!

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:56.800
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch
on unit number-- Where are we?

01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.260
3263827.

01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:49.600
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:51.560
Let's get moving.

01:25:52.730 --> 01:25:54.940
Where you goin'?

01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:56.530
Wait! They'll hear!

01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:00.450
Come here, you big coward.

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:02.200
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.830
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:08.750
but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?

01:26:09.670 --> 01:26:12.580
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

01:26:12.670 --> 01:26:15.340
I take orders from just one person-- me.

01:26:16.050 --> 01:26:17.970
It's a wonder you're still alive.

01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:21.260
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.640
No reward is worth this.

01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:35.770
Give me regular reports, please.

01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:36.940
Right.

01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:42.410
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

01:26:47.410 --> 01:26:49.450
You seen that new VT-16?

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:52.000
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.000
They say it's quite a thing to see.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.090
What was that?

01:26:56.170 --> 01:26:59.420
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:06.470
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.640
Yes, sir.

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.600
- Are you safe?
- For the moment.

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:12.060
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:15.650
We're right above you. Stand by.

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:18.530
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

01:27:18.610 --> 01:27:20.610
Nice. Come on.

01:27:24.110 --> 01:27:25.910
It's them. Blast them.

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:28.910
Get back to the ship!

01:27:28.990 --> 01:27:30.950
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:34.750
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:01.650
I think we took a wrong turn.

01:28:06.620 --> 01:28:07.530
There's no lock.

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:14.540
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:17.790
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.670
They're coming through.

01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:43.690
Here, hold this.

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.090
Here they come.

01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:14.020
For luck.

01:29:20.150 --> 01:29:24.150
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.000
Where could they be?

01:29:44.710 --> 01:29:46.630
Close the blast doors.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:56.230
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:19.370
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:21.830
The circle is now complete.

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:24.130
When I left you, I was but the learner.

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.590
Now I am the master.

01:30:26.670 --> 01:30:28.670
Only a master of evil, Darth.

01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:51.280
Your powers are weak, old man.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:55.030
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:58.500
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.010
You should not have come back.

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:35.370
Didn't we just leave this party?

01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.370
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

01:31:40.450 --> 01:31:42.960
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.170
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:00.890
Look.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.560
Come on, R2. We're going.

01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:09.360
Now's our chance. Go!

01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:43.180
Come on!

01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:46.400
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:57.570
Run, Luke, run.

01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:05.960
I hope that old man got the tractor beam down,
or this is gonna be a short trip. Hit it!

01:33:37.530 --> 01:33:39.450
We're coming up on their sentry ships.

01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:42.950
Hold them off. Angle the deflector
shields while I charge up the main guns.

01:33:52.130 --> 01:33:54.130
I can't believe he's gone.

01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:59.550
There wasn't anything you could have done.

01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:02.640
Come on, buddy. We're not out of this yet.

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:21.740
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.

01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:33.710
Here they come.

01:34:51.730 --> 01:34:53.560
They're coming in too fast!

01:35:01.570 --> 01:35:05.410
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:08.950
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:32.640
Got him. I got him!

01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:35.150
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.110
There's still two more.

01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:14.520
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:18.320
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:27.740
Are they away?

01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:30.200
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:34.290
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.880
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.880
This had better work.

01:36:40.090 --> 01:36:42.210
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.010
You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.

01:36:46.090 --> 01:36:48.430
That doesn't sound too hard.

01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:52.180
They let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:55.060
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.980
Not this ship, sister.

01:36:58.190 --> 01:37:00.730
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:03.280
What's so important? What's he carrying?

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.570
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

01:37:06.570 --> 01:37:09.870
I only hope that when the data's
analyzed a weakness can be found.

01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:13.330
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:16.790
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:19.750
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:22.050
You needn't worry about your reward.

01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:25.050
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:30.140
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:33.470
I wonder if he really cares
about anything... or anybody.

01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.060
I care.

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:44.320
So...

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.320
what do you think of her, Han?

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.280
I'm trying not to, kid.

01:37:49.110 --> 01:37:50.410
Good.

01:37:53.790 --> 01:37:56.750
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

01:37:58.830 --> 01:38:01.920
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me--

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:02.630
No.

01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:53.470
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:55.470
We have no time for sorrows, Commander.

01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:58.560
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:00.640
It's our only hope.

01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:24.460
- Yes.
- We're approaching the planet Yavin.

01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:26.880
The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.960
We are preparing to orbit the planet.

01:39:37.970 --> 01:39:40.060
The battle station is heavily shielded...

01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:43.600
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:48.400
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:53.740
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:59.290
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good
are snub fighters against that?

01:39:59.370 --> 01:40:03.960
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat...

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:06.040
or they'd have a tighter defense.

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:10.170
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:13.340
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:16.140
The approach will not be easy.

01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:19.390
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

01:40:19.470 --> 01:40:22.100
and skim the surface to this point.

01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:25.650
The target area is only two meters wide.

01:40:25.730 --> 01:40:29.400
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:33.860
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:36.700
A precise hit
will start a chain reaction...

01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:38.990
which should destroy the station.

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:42.620
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:45.870
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:48.130
That's impossible, even for a computer.

01:40:48.210 --> 01:40:52.010
No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

01:40:52.090 --> 01:40:54.510
They're not much bigger than two meters.

01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:57.760
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:08.610
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.

01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:12.990
The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.

01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:15.700
This will be a day long remembered.

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:17.780
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:20.450
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

01:41:26.210 --> 01:41:28.630
All flight crews, man your stations.

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:38.050
So, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:40.140
That's right. Yeah.

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:43.850
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:48.020
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be
fool enough to stick around here, do ya?

01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:51.730
Why don't you come with us?
You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.

01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:54.820
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?

01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:57.570
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

01:41:57.650 --> 01:42:00.450
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:02.950
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:06.000
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:09.000
It's more like... suicide.

01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:13.630
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

01:42:13.710 --> 01:42:16.380
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:17.840
Hey, Luke.

01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:23.510
May the Force be with you.

01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:33.230
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

01:42:37.650 --> 01:42:40.110
All pilots to your stations.

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:51.290
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.

01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:53.880
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:57.510
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

01:42:58.510 --> 01:43:00.970
I only wish Ben were here.

01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:10.980
Open main launch tubes.

01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:13.900
Main launch tubes opening, sir.

01:43:13.980 --> 01:43:15.650
Hey, Luke!

01:43:15.730 --> 01:43:18.940
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:21.110
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.

01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:23.530
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.120
Are you sure you can handle this ship?

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:30.620
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:33.830
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:37.840
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:40.670
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:43.760
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.560
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.810
Not on your life. That droid and I
have been through a lot.

01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:53.940
You okay, R2?

01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:56.980
Good.

01:43:58.030 --> 01:44:00.780
Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.

01:44:01.450 --> 01:44:04.450
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

01:44:06.330 --> 01:44:08.330
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

01:44:56.670 --> 01:44:59.670
Luke, the Force will be with you.

01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:15.230
Standby alert. Death Star approaching.

01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:18.480
Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.

01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:33.830
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:36.170
- Red Seven standing by.
- Red Three standing by.

01:45:36.250 --> 01:45:39.000
- Red Six standing by.
- Red Nine standing by.

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.130
- Red Two standing by.
- Red 11 standing by.

01:45:41.210 --> 01:45:43.170
Red Five standing by.

01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:46.430
Lock S-foils in attack position.

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:52.680
We're passing through the magnetic field.

01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:55.560
Hold tight. Switch your deflectors on.

01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.100
Double front.

01:46:00.110 --> 01:46:01.900
Look at the size of that thing.

01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:04.610
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:10.740
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:13.700
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- We're starting for the target shaft.

01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:17.250
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:34.970
- Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
- I see it. Stay low.

01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:43.940
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

01:46:48.490 --> 01:46:49.490
Luke, pull up!

01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:53.490
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:03.380
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so
small they're evading our turbolasers.

01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:05.380
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:07.590
Get the crews to their fighters.

01:47:10.130 --> 01:47:14.010
Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire coming from
the right side of that deflection tower.

01:47:14.100 --> 01:47:15.390
I'm on it.

01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:18.930
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:27.070
I've got a problem here.

01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:28.570
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

01:47:28.650 --> 01:47:30.820
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right--

01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:38.000
The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.

01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:44.500
Luke, trust your feelings.

01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:53.970
Squad leaders...

01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:56.100
we've picked up a new group of signals.

01:47:56.180 --> 01:47:58.140
Enemy fighters coming your way.

01:47:58.220 --> 01:47:59.930
My scope's negative. I don't see anything.

01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:02.230
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- Here they come.

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.190
You've got one on your tail.

01:48:12.530 --> 01:48:13.410
I'm hit!

01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:17.410
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:21.160
He's on me tight. I can't shake him.

01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:24.880
I'll be right there.

01:48:37.050 --> 01:48:40.520
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:47.060
- Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke.

01:48:47.150 --> 01:48:49.530
Fighters above you, coming in.

01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:58.490
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:00.740
Hang on back there.

01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:03.500
Red Six, can you see Red Five?

01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:06.000
There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:07.540
I can't shake him.

01:49:11.550 --> 01:49:13.090
I'm on him, Luke.

01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:17.930
Blast it, Biggs. Where are you?

01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:27.730
- Thanks, Wedge.
- Good shooting, Wedge.

01:49:27.810 --> 01:49:30.940
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.

01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:35.150
I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position.

01:49:37.570 --> 01:49:39.870
Stay in attack formation.

01:49:39.950 --> 01:49:42.790
The exhaust port is marked and locked in.

01:49:48.670 --> 01:49:55.130
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

01:49:59.850 --> 01:50:01.600
How many guns do you think, Gold Five?

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:04.930
Say about 20 guns,
some on the surface, some on the towers.

01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:07.850
Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.

01:50:09.980 --> 01:50:13.030
Switch to targeting computer.

01:50:15.490 --> 01:50:17.490
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:21.990
The guns. They've stopped.

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:26.250
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

01:50:26.330 --> 01:50:28.830
They're coming in. Three marks at 210.

01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:32.960
I'll take them myself. Cover me.

01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:34.340
Yes, sir.

01:50:48.850 --> 01:50:51.310
- It's no good. I can't maneuver.
- Stay on target.

01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:53.320
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:56.030
Loosen up!

01:50:59.030 --> 01:51:01.910
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:04.370
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

01:51:10.710 --> 01:51:13.340
We've analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

01:51:13.420 --> 01:51:15.340
Should I have your ship standing by?

01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:18.300
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:20.880
I think you overestimate their chances.

01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:23.600
Rebel base, three minutes and closing.

01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:26.220
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:28.020
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.

01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:31.650
- This is Red Two flying toward you.
- Red Three standing by.

01:51:31.730 --> 01:51:33.690
Red Leader, this is Base One.

01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:36.440
Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.

01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:39.150
Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.

01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:42.570
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:52.250
This is it.

01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:58.920
We should be able to see it by now.

01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:02.380
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:06.560
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?

01:52:06.640 --> 01:52:09.640
- No sign of any-- Wait. Coming in .35.
- I see them.

01:52:11.190 --> 01:52:12.270
I'm in range.

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.270
Target's coming up.

01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:19.990
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:22.450
Close up formation.

01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:25.950
Almost there.

01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:38.300
- Let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

01:52:39.670 --> 01:52:41.340
I can't hold them.

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:50.310
It's away!

01:52:54.810 --> 01:52:56.440
- It's a hit!
- Negative.

01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:58.610
Negative. It didn't go in.

01:52:58.690 --> 01:53:01.360
It just impacted on the surface.

01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:09.490
Red Leader, we're right above you.

01:53:09.580 --> 01:53:11.750
Turn to .05. We'll cover for you.

01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:14.790
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:17.840
Get set up for your attack run.

01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:33.810
Rebel base, one minute and closing.

01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:36.100
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

01:53:36.190 --> 01:53:39.570
We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.

01:53:39.650 --> 01:53:41.780
Right with you, boss.

01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:44.150
At that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:46.240
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:55.830
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:58.500
My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port.

01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:00.040
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

01:54:03.550 --> 01:54:05.550
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:06.930
What about that tower?

01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:09.430
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.

01:54:15.850 --> 01:54:19.440
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose
again. See if you can't lock it down.

01:54:28.610 --> 01:54:30.410
Fighters coming in .3.

01:54:39.330 --> 01:54:41.840
- I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
- Get clear, Wedge.

01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:44.420
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.

01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:47.420
Let him go. Stay on the leader.

01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:52.600
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.

01:54:56.770 --> 01:54:59.480
R2, try and increase the power.

01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:06.110
Hurry up, Luke. Quick.

01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:08.150
Quick.

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:17.750
Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.

01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:18.960
I'm on the leader.

01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:23.920
Hang on, R2.

01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:41.900
Use the Force, Luke.

01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:47.150
Let go, Luke.

01:55:48.610 --> 01:55:50.990
The Force is strong with this one.

01:55:51.070 --> 01:55:53.030
Luke, trust me.

01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:00.040
His computer's off.

01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.250
You switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?

01:56:02.330 --> 01:56:05.000
Nothing. I'm all right.

01:56:17.930 --> 01:56:19.180
I've lost R2.

01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:25.560
The Death Star has cleared the planet.

01:56:26.610 --> 01:56:28.230
Rebel base in range.

01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:30.240
You may fire when ready.

01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:32.400
Commence primary ignition.

01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:47.840
I have you now.

01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.420
What?

01:56:54.050 --> 01:56:54.890
Look out.

01:57:01.730 --> 01:57:04.560
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:17.450
Stand by.

01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:29.880
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:35.760
Remember, the Force
will be with you always.

01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:03.000
I just knew you'd come back.

01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:05.620
I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

01:58:05.710 --> 01:58:07.670
I knew there was more to you than money.

01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:09.630
Oh, no.

01:58:09.710 --> 01:58:12.170
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:15.720
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:19.050
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:22.060
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:24.140
He'll be all right.

01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:22.060
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:24.140
He'll be all right.
