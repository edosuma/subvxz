WEBVTT

00:02.060 --> 00:05.820
'My name's Maria Jackson,
and this is Bannerman Road.

00:05.820 --> 00:10.260
'I've just moved in with my dad
after he and my mum got divorced.'

00:10.260 --> 00:12.060
Oh, right, on the brush.

00:12.060 --> 00:14.419
You've got some on your face.
There, just there.

00:18.619 --> 00:22.540
Then,
in this big old house over the road,

00:22.540 --> 00:24.619
I met Sarah Jane Smith.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.260
She's a journalist...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.819
who investigates aliens.

00:35.459 --> 00:38.780
That's Luke.
Born yesterday, near enough.

00:38.780 --> 00:43.459
Sarah Jane's adopted him,
and together, we saved the world.

00:47.059 --> 00:51.260
I discovered that life was so much
bigger and stranger and better

00:51.260 --> 00:53.299
than I ever thought possible.

00:53.299 --> 00:56.339
Oi! Thank you.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

00:58.099 --> 01:01.859
But when school began, I thought
things might go back to normal.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.499
I was wrong.

01:06.499 --> 01:08.340
They just got weirder...

01:09.580 --> 01:11.179
..and weirder...

01:12.780 --> 01:14.779
..and weirder.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.179
Wahhhh!

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.220 --> 01:38.700
Now, you take care. OK?

01:38.700 --> 01:41.059
Goodbye, Mum. Oh, I don't think so.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.779
No, Sarah Jane's just fine.

01:42.779 --> 01:44.860
Oh, hi, Maria.

01:47.380 --> 01:48.899
CHILDREN LAUGH

01:55.860 --> 01:57.819
Why were they laughing?

01:57.819 --> 02:01.019
First day, and your mum's
kissing you goodbye? Is that bad?

02:01.019 --> 02:04.379
Bit embarrassing. Plus,
she so wants you to call her Mum.

02:04.379 --> 02:06.979
She said she didn't.
It's not what she said.

02:06.979 --> 02:09.699
That's a bit flashy.
It's a brand new building.

02:09.699 --> 02:13.699
There was an article about it in
the paper. Wonder what's inside it?

02:17.500 --> 02:19.980
Not them. Scan along.

02:19.980 --> 02:21.420
Where is he?

02:23.579 --> 02:26.420
There! Him.

02:26.420 --> 02:29.660
He's not that big. How will I fit?

02:29.660 --> 02:34.219
He'll do. Get yourself ready.

02:34.219 --> 02:36.219
I'll go fetch.

02:37.780 --> 02:40.459
What can I do for you?
Stand right there, Tim.

02:40.459 --> 02:42.779
Any particular reason?

02:42.779 --> 02:46.100
Very particular.
HE BREAKS WIND
Oops!

02:46.100 --> 02:47.579
Happens to us all.

02:47.579 --> 02:51.100
And I'll need those. Sorry?

02:55.220 --> 02:56.659
Waaaaahhhhh!

03:06.619 --> 03:09.580
I'm feeling anxious. So am I.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.179
But you've been to school before.

03:11.179 --> 03:13.819
Not this one. Budge up.

03:17.260 --> 03:19.619
You new today? Yeah. Maria.

03:19.619 --> 03:22.460
Clyde. New too.
Probably hang around with you

03:22.460 --> 03:26.380
till I meet some cooler people.
How do you do? I'm Luke Smith.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.380
OK, that was a joke. Now I mean it.

03:29.380 --> 03:34.339
Good morning everybody.
ALL: Good morning, Mr Blakeman.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.899
HE BREAKS WIND, EVERYONE LAUGHS

03:36.899 --> 03:40.579
What's funny? The wife gave me
cabbage and bean tartlets last night.

03:40.579 --> 03:44.140
Yet another reason
to despise Jamie Oliver.

03:46.740 --> 03:51.180
Welcome back everybody, it's
a new year, hope you all do well.

03:51.180 --> 03:55.939
Don't run in the courtyard,
don't even think of wearing make-up,
and study hard,

03:55.939 --> 04:00.780
because I guarantee
none of you are gonna be pop stars.

04:00.780 --> 04:03.139
What's his problem?

04:03.139 --> 04:06.179
So.... What else?
HE BREAKS WIND

04:06.179 --> 04:07.540
Oh, yeah.

04:07.540 --> 04:11.860
What a bright future you've all got,
children of the world!

04:11.860 --> 04:14.459
Etcetera. Right...

04:14.459 --> 04:17.300
as you've seen,
we have a new technology block.

04:17.300 --> 04:21.820
I'll be taking you over in groups to
look at our amazing new facilities,

04:21.820 --> 04:27.700
starting with...Form 10B.

04:29.860 --> 04:33.259
There are 16 classrooms
with broadband connections,

04:33.259 --> 04:37.540
but anything dubious your adolescent
minds may be drawn to,

04:37.540 --> 04:38.819
I've locked out.

04:38.819 --> 04:41.140
I've signed us up for this.
First meeting's tomorrow.

04:41.140 --> 04:44.299
Lunchtime science club?
And now I'm backing away.

04:44.299 --> 04:45.940
HE BREAKS WIND
Shut up!

04:46.060 --> 04:47.860
Why is farting funny?

04:47.860 --> 04:50.579
It just is. But it's a normal
process of the human bowel.

04:50.579 --> 04:52.540
Are you for real?

04:52.540 --> 04:55.139
Smells weird in here. Farts?

04:55.139 --> 04:58.019
Dunno...metal, electric.

04:58.019 --> 04:59.820
Like batteries.

05:01.420 --> 05:04.340
Can I sit here?
Only if I'm not gonna shame you.

05:04.340 --> 05:07.980
Well, I either sit here with you
or sit there with that.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.780
What, there's someone worse than me?
Just.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.740
So where are you from? Hounslow.
My parents split up,

05:15.740 --> 05:18.979
so I moved here with Mum. Like me.
Only I moved with my dad.

05:18.979 --> 05:22.860
Yeah, how's that? Better than
them rowing all the time. Yeah.

05:22.860 --> 05:24.020
Ow!

05:26.339 --> 05:29.419
What's wrong with that? It's mouldy!

05:29.419 --> 05:31.819
What kind of slop
are they serving here?

05:31.819 --> 05:34.339
Is it leftovers from last term
or something?

05:34.339 --> 05:36.380
Sir? Sir? What?

05:36.380 --> 05:38.620
How am I meant to eat that?

05:39.939 --> 05:42.220
Just pick the bad bits off.

05:44.419 --> 05:47.060
Great. That leaves me with a pea.

05:49.300 --> 05:53.620
Mine's off too! That is disgusting!
What's wrong with this place?

05:53.620 --> 05:57.379
It stinks, the food's rotten.
Something weird's going on here.

06:01.379 --> 06:04.379
Goodbye, repellent pubescents.

06:04.379 --> 06:07.900
Until tomorrow. This skin...
it's killing me round the legs.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.379
Right. Time for a test run.

06:09.379 --> 06:11.499
Now? What about the caretaker?

06:11.499 --> 06:13.340
I've taken care of the caretaker.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.820
Everything's ready. Come on!

06:15.820 --> 06:18.740
Oh, I see, you've cadged a lift,
have you?

06:18.740 --> 06:23.900
I offered. I dunno, Lady Muck,
getting the neighbours

06:23.900 --> 06:28.060
to chauffeur her around. Shut up,
Dad. How was the first day, then?

06:28.060 --> 06:31.300
OK. A bit weird, though.
The headmaster keeps farting.

06:31.300 --> 06:35.099
Really? What, noisy smelly ones
or silent but deadlies? Eugh! What?

06:35.099 --> 06:37.699
Place stinks like batteries.
And the food was off.

06:37.699 --> 06:39.340
I'll make you a proper tea.

06:39.340 --> 06:42.179
You go and get changed.
Bye. See you, Maria.

06:42.179 --> 06:43.700
I want a proper tea too!

06:43.700 --> 06:45.859
Make it yourself! I'm not your cook.

06:45.859 --> 06:49.460
Whatever. No, forget it, it's all
right. We'll phone out for a curry.

06:49.460 --> 06:53.140
Can't have you straining yourself
after your long voyage home, can we?

06:53.140 --> 06:54.900
You think you're so funny! Yeah.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.660
How do you get like that,
you and Maria?

06:57.660 --> 07:01.580
Always been like that,
don't really think about it.

07:01.580 --> 07:05.780
Anyway, the school can't be
that bad, they've just built this.

07:05.780 --> 07:09.420
Someone donated the money and
this technology block was put up.

07:09.420 --> 07:12.860
Looks incredible. Hold on. I did an
IT job in a school, in a new block

07:12.860 --> 07:16.220
that looks like that. Was it built
by Coldfire Construction?

07:16.220 --> 07:20.100
Yeah. Where? On the other side of
town. St Sheldon's, in Upminster.

07:20.100 --> 07:22.740
That place smelt odd.
Sort of metallic.

07:22.740 --> 07:24.900
Anyway, better go.

07:24.900 --> 07:28.220
Stop her ordering the entire menu.
Bye!

07:31.100 --> 07:33.060
Systems online.

07:34.060 --> 07:39.700
That's it. Now, synchronise the
mega-wattage. Synchronizing mega...

07:39.700 --> 07:43.100
watty...er...

07:43.100 --> 07:44.340
That one!

07:53.059 --> 07:57.259
Kept making social mistakes today.
I think I made one too.

07:57.259 --> 08:00.899
Driving to school when it's round
the corner, kissing you goodbye.

08:00.899 --> 08:04.099
Oh, we're both new hands at this.

08:04.099 --> 08:06.300
I don't know anyone
except Maria and Clyde.

08:06.300 --> 08:09.020
Maria's in different classes
to me most of the time.

08:09.020 --> 08:12.899
And Clyde thinks I'm uncool. Clyde's
not the only kid in the school.

08:12.899 --> 08:17.100
What if I make more mistakes?
Never make the same ones again.

08:17.100 --> 08:21.339
Listen, anyone is nervous
starting a new school, a new job.

08:21.339 --> 08:24.500
I've never been a mum before.
Do I have to go?

08:24.500 --> 08:28.780
I could take you out,
teach you here. I considered it.

08:28.780 --> 08:33.179
But you, Luke Smith,
you're going to live a normal life,

08:33.179 --> 08:35.179
as normal a life as I can give you.

08:35.179 --> 08:39.340
What if I get it wrong again?
It makes me feel...stupid.

08:39.340 --> 08:42.140
Remember, you saved the world
the day you were born.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.419
Not many people can say that.

08:44.419 --> 08:48.699
No-one else can say that. That's
the problem. Nobody else is like me.

08:50.980 --> 08:54.859
What are you doing? Checking up on
the firm who built your new block.

08:54.859 --> 08:57.020
Coldfire Construction.

08:57.020 --> 09:00.739
They started expanding 18 months
ago, contracts all round the world.

09:00.739 --> 09:02.820
Some odd things cropping up.

09:02.820 --> 09:06.340
Now they're putting up school
buildings all round London.

09:06.340 --> 09:07.659
Makes a change for me.

09:09.060 --> 09:11.900
Not aliens, is it?

09:15.060 --> 09:17.539
Stabilising...

09:17.539 --> 09:18.739
There!

09:18.739 --> 09:20.019
Aaah!

09:21.300 --> 09:23.900
Only me, come for a gawp.

09:27.060 --> 09:30.620
Alan, this is really
kind of all right!

09:30.620 --> 09:34.940
Thanks, Chrissie, I really value
your opinion. Don't be sarky.

09:34.940 --> 09:38.220
Is Maria upstairs? I think
it went OK for her today.

09:38.220 --> 09:42.900
What went OK for her today? Her
first day at the new school. Today?

09:42.900 --> 09:45.460
My mind's just been
all over the place,

09:45.460 --> 09:47.500
stress like you would not believe.

09:47.500 --> 09:52.180
So why did you come round? To see my
daughter. Do I need another reason?

09:52.180 --> 09:54.580
Oh, while I think about it,

09:54.580 --> 09:58.019
you were gonna give me
that 13.5 tog double duvet?

09:58.019 --> 10:00.899
Only you don't need it,
you've got the single.

10:00.899 --> 10:03.180
Maria, love, it's your mum!

10:07.939 --> 10:09.940
Lights out, London!

10:16.180 --> 10:17.940
School can't be that bad.

10:17.940 --> 10:21.539
I mean, like I said, it's
a much better catchment area.

10:21.539 --> 10:26.140
Ooh, got to go, love. Ivan's taking
me to the pub, it's opera night.

10:26.140 --> 10:30.059
The waiters sing while you're eating.

10:30.059 --> 10:32.220
Oh, great(!)

10:32.220 --> 10:34.499
There's a torch.

10:38.139 --> 10:42.019
With a flat battery.
I'm not saying anything

10:42.019 --> 10:44.019
I'll get the candles.

10:44.019 --> 10:47.220
Power cut?
Yes, Mr Smith's not responding.

10:47.220 --> 10:51.660
The computer just went pffft, and
guess who forgot to save her work?

10:51.660 --> 10:55.020
I'll just see how long it'll be,
I can check the local power grid.

10:56.700 --> 11:00.979
That's impossible. It never
loses power. Can't lose power.

11:00.979 --> 11:03.900
There we go. Goes as far as
I can see.

11:03.900 --> 11:07.780
Happened all the time
when I was a kid.

11:07.780 --> 11:11.340
It once went off right in the middle
of Manimal, I was distraught.

11:20.620 --> 11:23.459
Weird. Why's that happening?

11:23.459 --> 11:25.620
Give them to me!
I can do it. No, I'll do it.

11:28.700 --> 11:31.699
What was that?
It's destabilising hell!

11:31.699 --> 11:35.420
Turn it off, turn it off!
Turn it off!

11:57.059 --> 11:59.299
What?

11:59.299 --> 12:02.220
Weird. Must be faulty.

12:02.220 --> 12:05.340
Or the same thing that cut
the electric off cut this off.

12:05.340 --> 12:08.220
Fantastic(!) Every station
in the loop is working,

12:08.220 --> 12:09.859
but the stabiliser cuts out!

12:09.859 --> 12:12.699
I'll fix it. You bought those plans
off that Wallarian,

12:12.699 --> 12:15.979
you took his word it worked!
I'll sort out the storage problem,

12:15.979 --> 12:20.700
then it'll stabilise, OK? Until then
I'm stuck here, in this.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.699
Teaching science
on the planet Thick

12:22.699 --> 12:26.139
where they still haven't worked
out string theory! Ooh, it chafes!

12:26.139 --> 12:28.219
Oh, shut up! Don't you get it?

12:28.219 --> 12:31.139
We're nearly there! One more step...

12:31.139 --> 12:34.219
and we destroy this planet!

12:37.939 --> 12:40.020
Science is my first class today.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.340
Lab 2A, with Mr Jeffrey.

12:42.340 --> 12:44.379
You'll be fine!

12:44.379 --> 12:45.859
See you, then.

12:50.059 --> 12:51.779
Oh, hi.

12:51.779 --> 12:53.740
Oh, not interrupting? No, no, no.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.820
Just making a start. Had a bigger
garden in the old house.

12:56.820 --> 13:00.259
Do you miss it?
Yeah, well, needs must and all that.

13:00.259 --> 13:02.659
Shame, I had a lot of plans
for that old garden.

13:02.659 --> 13:05.940
Just didn't plan on my wife
running off with a judo instructor.

13:05.940 --> 13:08.980
You ever been married?
No. Never found time.

13:08.980 --> 13:12.019
Wise move. Anyway...sorry?
Oh, I was just wondering,

13:12.019 --> 13:15.099
that school you mentioned
in Upminster. St Sheldon's?

13:15.099 --> 13:18.179
I'm sure I've still got
the plans here somewhere.

13:18.179 --> 13:20.379
Yeah, there we go.

13:20.379 --> 13:24.139
Cost a fortune. They had
broadband installed, the works.

13:24.139 --> 13:27.260
Where did the money come from?
I dunno, private funding.

13:27.260 --> 13:31.779
What sort of journalist are you?
Oh, local stories, nothing exciting.

13:31.779 --> 13:35.459
Maria was saying you'd travelled
a fair bit? Could say that, yeah.

13:35.459 --> 13:37.180
What's that bit? It's blank.

13:37.180 --> 13:40.660
Never went in. Coldfire kept that
to themselves, it was sealed off.

13:40.660 --> 13:44.299
There's no door. You reckon
they're hiding something, do you?

13:44.299 --> 13:46.699
Ooh, something mysterious
inside a school.

13:46.699 --> 13:50.500
That would be ridiculous! A bit.
Do you mind if I keep this? No.

13:53.140 --> 13:55.819
A transformer is
an electrical device

13:55.819 --> 13:58.700
that changes the voltage
of the AC supply.

13:58.700 --> 14:01.420
Such as your...

14:01.420 --> 14:04.059
our mains electrical supply.

14:04.059 --> 14:07.340
Anybody know who invented
the first transformer? ..You.

14:07.340 --> 14:10.980
Faraday. Correct. Though he didn't
know what to use it for. What?

14:10.980 --> 14:14.780
I've thought about it too. You could
get rid of the transformers,

14:14.780 --> 14:17.539
get a better system
and induct power instead.

14:17.539 --> 14:21.099
Just pointing out, I'm nothing
to do with him. Quiet!

14:21.099 --> 14:23.380
Name. Clyde Langer.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.460
Troublemaker. Noted.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.180
OK.

14:29.100 --> 14:32.260
You're cool because you make trouble.
Should I make trouble?

14:32.260 --> 14:34.139
I hear talking!

14:37.020 --> 14:42.379
run out, I'm getting a new one.

14:42.379 --> 14:44.899
Let me see that.

14:45.979 --> 14:48.619
Oh! What is it? Cold chip sandwich.

14:48.619 --> 14:53.100
Made it this morning. Not chancing
my life in that canteen again.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.979
Oi, you can't do that!

14:54.979 --> 14:58.860
You can wait until lunchtime and
use the canteen like everybody else.

14:58.860 --> 15:01.780
I'll report you for that!
Go on, try it.

15:01.780 --> 15:04.340
HE BREAKS WIND

15:04.340 --> 15:05.900
PUPILS LAUGH, BELL RINGS

15:05.900 --> 15:11.340
Right. For tomorrow,
1,000 words on transformers! Oh!

15:11.340 --> 15:12.940
2,000!

15:21.379 --> 15:24.539
Hopeless, Miss Smith!
Even worse this term.

15:24.539 --> 15:27.859
I believe you had the wiring
in your new block re-installed.

15:27.859 --> 15:31.939
keep crashing. And look.

15:31.939 --> 15:34.620
Look at this.

15:34.620 --> 15:37.499
Fresh this morning.
Everything goes off.

15:37.499 --> 15:40.459
And there's that smell.
Like batteries.

15:40.459 --> 15:43.619
And it started when you got
your new technology block?

15:43.619 --> 15:46.260
Hasn't anyone tried to work out
what's wrong?

15:46.260 --> 15:49.179
a parent governor raised it
at our meeting. And?

15:49.179 --> 15:53.539
Fell off his bike the next morning,
three months in traction.

15:53.539 --> 15:55.899
Can't you feel it, Miss Smith?

15:56.859 --> 15:59.860
Like...a thunderstorm's coming.

16:05.100 --> 16:07.740
Hello, Miss Smith.
SHE LAUGHS

16:07.740 --> 16:09.420
Incredible knowledge!

16:09.420 --> 16:13.859
This child, Luke Smith, is a freak.
You really think he can help us?

16:13.859 --> 16:16.459
Yes! We'll use him
to solve the storage problem.

16:16.459 --> 16:21.339
A 14-year-old human? Something's
strange about him. These kids stink.

16:21.339 --> 16:27.139
Acne and grease and coats
and crisps. But he smells...fresh.

16:27.139 --> 16:29.339
When can you get to him? Very soon.

16:29.339 --> 16:32.059
We have a rendezvous.

16:32.059 --> 16:35.340
Welcome to lunchtime science club.

16:35.340 --> 16:39.180
I had hoped for a slightly
higher turnout, but never mind.

16:39.180 --> 16:41.340
There's only me.

16:41.340 --> 16:43.580
And me. Carl.

16:43.580 --> 16:45.940
Luke. Pleased to meet you.

16:47.020 --> 16:50.900
Hi. Carl's the science star
of the school, supposedly.

16:50.900 --> 16:54.740
Though I imagine he's probably
pretty rubbish compared to you.

16:54.740 --> 17:00.460
Take a look at this. Now, over the
summer I've been having tons of fun

17:00.460 --> 17:02.620
working on a new project.

17:02.620 --> 17:06.140
What do you make of this?

17:06.140 --> 17:09.819
Um... It's a model
for a giant capacitor system.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.500
Purely theoretical.

17:11.500 --> 17:14.059
Nobody could possibly build this
for real.

17:14.059 --> 17:17.699
You designed this?
Yes, I'm wasted here.

17:17.699 --> 17:21.339
Do you like it? It's amazing.
Let me see.

17:21.339 --> 17:23.700
Now, I have a problem.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.539
My purely theoretical problem is...

17:26.539 --> 17:28.339
anyone? Don't tell me.

17:28.339 --> 17:32.180
Oh, yeah. With this, you could store
huge amounts of electrical energy.

17:32.180 --> 17:33.940
But there's a loophole.

17:33.940 --> 17:36.780
Here in the storage,
it wouldn't stabilise.

17:36.780 --> 17:40.099
That's my problem, well done.
Gold star.

17:40.099 --> 17:42.580
No star. You went wrong here.

17:42.580 --> 17:46.019
You need to add an equation
into the computer control.

17:56.980 --> 17:58.819
Yeah?

17:58.819 --> 18:00.980
I'll take your word for it.

18:00.980 --> 18:06.299
The power stabilises, your problems
are over. Yes. All my problems are...

18:06.299 --> 18:09.539
I don't know about yours, though.

18:09.539 --> 18:12.899
And that school has exactly
the same problem as yours.

18:12.899 --> 18:15.180
So I'm off to Coldfire Construction.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.019
Do you want me to do anything? Yeah,

18:17.019 --> 18:20.740
have a look round, see if you can
find where that smell's coming from.

18:20.740 --> 18:23.779
OK, see you later. Good luck!

18:23.779 --> 18:27.139
Who was that, then? Nobody.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.540
Result!

18:30.540 --> 18:32.500
Yes! That's it!

18:32.500 --> 18:35.700
And he just handed it over!

18:35.700 --> 18:37.780
Hilarious! Humans...

18:37.780 --> 18:40.220
even the clever ones are stupid!

18:40.220 --> 18:42.019
At last! We will be avenged!

18:42.019 --> 18:44.820
We'll finish this planet tonight!

18:49.420 --> 18:53.339
Someone looks happy!
I had double maths this afternoon.

18:53.339 --> 18:56.899
Science club was brilliant.
Mr Jeffrey's really nice.

18:56.899 --> 19:00.380
I think we'll be friends. You don't
make friends with a teacher.

19:00.380 --> 19:03.100
Why not? You just don't.
Anyway, Sarah Jane phoned,

19:03.100 --> 19:05.260
she wants us to look
inside the new block.

19:05.260 --> 19:08.099
What are you doing?
Investigating the new block.

19:08.099 --> 19:12.739
I left something in the new block.
What is it with you and her?

19:12.739 --> 19:15.100
I've seen weird people,
I know weird people.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.700
But you two, you're beyond weird.
Go find some normal people then.

19:30.140 --> 19:32.340
Can I help you?

19:32.340 --> 19:34.019
That's not right.

19:34.019 --> 19:36.660
I want answers. Where are you from?

19:36.660 --> 19:40.059
doesn't make any sense.

19:40.059 --> 19:43.580
But where've you been all your life?
You don't know farting's funny,

19:43.580 --> 19:46.779
you let your mum kiss you in public.
Where was your last school?

19:46.779 --> 19:49.859
I've never been to school.
Your mum taught you at home? No.

19:49.859 --> 19:53.539
And she isn't my mum. There are 16
classrooms in this building. Hold on.

19:53.539 --> 19:56.220
What's Sarah Jane to you?
She adopted me.

19:56.220 --> 20:00.300
Why don't you call her Mum?
She doesn't want me to.

20:03.979 --> 20:07.339
What about your real mum and dad?
I haven't got a mum or dad.

20:07.339 --> 20:10.779
Everybody's got a mum and dad.
I have a dad...somewhere.

20:10.779 --> 20:14.260
This block measures about
1,539 metres squared,

20:14.260 --> 20:16.259
so double that for both floors...

20:16.259 --> 20:18.940
The area of each room
doesn't add up to that.

20:18.940 --> 20:22.580
So there's an empty space...
through there!

20:22.580 --> 20:25.179
I think you should go home.

20:26.499 --> 20:30.499
So what are you saying
about our company then? Miss...?

20:30.499 --> 20:32.899
Oh, you can call me Janine.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.900
Janine.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.939
I've been reading up. It's not just
these school projects in London.

20:38.939 --> 20:44.700
You've moved from country to
country, hiring cheap local labour.

20:44.700 --> 20:49.300
Yes? At your building in Santiago,
workers refuse to go in.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.779
Food goes off.
Endless technical problems.

20:51.779 --> 20:54.979
Valencia, Paris, the same story.
And another thing.

20:54.979 --> 20:59.060
The plans for each building have
a large empty area behind a wall.

20:59.060 --> 21:00.459
Why is that?

21:00.459 --> 21:03.099
There's another room, a secret room.
Behind there!

21:03.099 --> 21:07.060
I'll tell you this... But how do you
get inside? I'm not getting through.

21:07.060 --> 21:09.140
Stop...being...strange.

21:24.859 --> 21:27.100
Who's that?

21:31.339 --> 21:33.339
I know you're in here...

21:33.339 --> 21:36.139
I can smell you.

21:36.139 --> 21:38.459
HE SNIFFS

21:38.459 --> 21:40.459
Ah, a little girl.

21:40.459 --> 21:43.180
Fresh as a daisy.

21:43.180 --> 21:47.059
Sugar and spice and all things nice.

21:47.059 --> 21:52.739
She really shouldn't be hanging
around school after home time.

21:53.779 --> 22:00.499
Not when I've got no reason to hide
in this stupid skin any longer.

22:00.499 --> 22:02.780
SQUEAKING

22:02.780 --> 22:07.139
because these projects are so far
apart, nobody connects them.

22:07.139 --> 22:10.620
I strongly advise you
to leave right now.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.739
If you know what's good for you.

22:12.739 --> 22:15.420
Is that a threat? Yes.

22:15.420 --> 22:16.860
What?

22:16.860 --> 22:18.700
After all...

22:18.700 --> 22:21.300
why should I hide?

22:31.299 --> 22:34.420
That was your last chance,
Miss Smith. Be fair.

22:34.420 --> 22:36.340
I did give you fair warning...

23:00.219 --> 23:02.740
I am Slitheen!

23:05.219 --> 23:09.619
Oh, I love it when they run!

23:19.419 --> 23:21.979
Your Luke Smith's too clever by half.

23:21.979 --> 23:26.299
He's right outside! There's
another one. I'm after her now.

23:26.299 --> 23:30.220
Oh, it feels good, after so long.

23:30.220 --> 23:32.620
Rejoice in your hunt, brother!

23:34.900 --> 23:38.420
I know you're in here,
I can smell you.

23:40.220 --> 23:46.140
Mmm, what lovely perfume
you're wearing, Miss Smith!

23:47.220 --> 23:50.780
You're positively fragrant!

23:55.260 --> 23:57.699
We're out of here, now, come on!

23:57.699 --> 24:01.379
What? Where's Luke?
I know you're out there, girl...

24:01.379 --> 24:05.100
That's only Mr Jeffrey. And
another one! A boy! You are sad.

24:05.100 --> 24:09.820
Hiding from a teacher. What can he
do? Give you a detention? Come on!

24:09.820 --> 24:11.939
Oh, no!

24:11.939 --> 24:15.820
Run! It's no fun if you don't run!

24:15.820 --> 24:19.660
The smell of human fear...

24:19.660 --> 24:20.860
love it!

24:22.979 --> 24:25.579
Kiddies!

24:25.579 --> 24:28.539
Kiddywinks!

24:28.539 --> 24:33.300
Run as fast as you can,
I'm coming to find you.

24:33.300 --> 24:35.100
Raarghh!!

24:45.099 --> 24:48.660
It's a door. And every door
must have a door handle.

24:50.220 --> 24:51.700
About here?

24:56.299 --> 25:01.099
Children, children, come to me.

25:01.099 --> 25:04.860
We've gotta get out of here!
We can't. We need to fight them.

25:04.860 --> 25:06.659
Quick, in here!

25:26.139 --> 25:31.219
So, Luke, how d'you like
our little science project?

25:33.259 --> 25:36.060
So where's Jeffrey? I heard him.

25:36.060 --> 25:39.700
That's Jeffrey, that thing chasing
us. Oh, I'll believe it, why not?

25:39.700 --> 25:42.300
Thanks.
Is there a way out through here?

25:42.300 --> 25:45.620
No. There's no way out.
HE BREAKS WIND

25:46.580 --> 25:47.620
Oh, no.

25:52.060 --> 25:55.180
Ha-ha-ha!

25:57.059 --> 26:00.859
I am a child of the Slitheen
and this is my hunt!
