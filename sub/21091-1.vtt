01:45.120 --> 01:46.599
It's been a day of disappointment...

01:46.800 --> 01:48.950
...at the U.S. Women's Figure
Skating Championship.

01:49.160 --> 01:52.755
Jacqueline Dorsey should easily
repeat last year's victory.

01:52.960 --> 01:54.951
Well, let's not get too
far ahead of ourselves...

01:55.160 --> 01:57.993
...because as we've already seen
here today, anything can happen.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.839
Okay, now, listen to me.
I don't want you to push it.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.998
Take out everything but the first triple.
Doubles will win this.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.509
-And the spin at the transition.
-No.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.314
It is not a required element.
You can't push it.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.988
The most important thing
is to skate a clean program.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.760
No. The most important thing
is to win.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.918
-And that is why--
-Mom.

02:18.120 --> 02:20.759
It's not worth winning
if you don't have to fight for it.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.428
I think you were the one
who taught me that.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.949
Well, who knew you ever listened?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.319
Do me a favour...

02:28.520 --> 02:31.751
...just try to come back without
too much ice on your butt, okay?

02:35.760 --> 02:37.716
As of now, it's hers to lose.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.480
Well, I'm glad you said it, Oksana,
because I think...

02:40.680 --> 02:42.557
...her best skating is still to come.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.558
And that, friends,
is straight from her father's mouth.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.512
Ladies and gentlemen, on the ice:

02:47.720 --> 02:52.236
Two-time U.S. singles champion
Jackie Dorsey.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.359
She usually begins her routine
with her most difficult element:

03:13.560 --> 03:15.551
The triple axel.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.557
And she nailed it.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.113
Now she's lining up
for her first double combination.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.679
Unbelievable. She replaced it
with a triple-triple combination.

04:05.240 --> 04:09.028
She is not just beating this
competition, she is destroying it.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.800
Just one more jump in her program
and she's home free.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.714
-Why isn't she getting up?
-I think she's really hurt.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.473
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stay in your seats.

04:36.680 --> 04:37.829
Get back.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.110
Please remain seated.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.395
As I suspected, the fracture
was to both bones in the lower leg.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.828
I wouldn't worry.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.349
Though the break was complicated,
you should be up...

05:26.560 --> 05:29.996
-...and walking around in no time.
-That's not what I asked you.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.790
Let's just take it one step at a time,
okay, honey?

05:33.880 --> 05:35.598
You have to walk
before you can glide.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.631
Don't care about walking.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.480
Next year is an Olympic year.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.035
And I am not retiring.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.675
-Tell them.
-Nobody said anything about retiring.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.828
I've done everything I can do,
Jackie.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.078
-The rest is up to you.
-Good.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.076
Then we should have nothing
to worry about.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.632
Good. Now keep your head up
and really, really lift off this time.

06:37.080 --> 06:41.073
-Better.
-Better? That was amazing.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.440
For a double, it was okay.
But for a triple, it sucked.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.631
Jackie, the fact
that after only four months...

06:48.840 --> 06:51.308
...you can even hit
a double is amazing.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.717
Doubles are meaningless.
This isn't pairs.

06:57.640 --> 07:00.234
In hockey they'd call her
for high-sticking.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.955
Believe me, what I wouldn't give
for a whistle and a penalty box.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.276
All right, let's go again.

07:08.640 --> 07:09.868
Jackie.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.551
-Are you all right?
-Not a word.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.069
You cannot keep pushing yourself
like this.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.874
If you don't like it,
you don't have to watch.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.752
Why are you always
so damn stubborn?

07:21.960 --> 07:23.871
Because I take after my father.

07:24.080 --> 07:26.469
I suppose that accounts
for the sweet disposition also.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.955
No. That's all Mom.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.797
I know you don't wanna talk
about this...

07:32.000 --> 07:35.788
-...but what if you can't ever--?
-Right, I don't wanna talk about that.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.834
All I'm asking is that you take
some time off, all right? Rest.

07:40.040 --> 07:43.828
Don't think about skating for a while.
See if there's something more to life.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.749
Nice. Especially coming from you,
who built this multi-rinked palace.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.951
-Jackie.
-What?

07:51.480 --> 07:55.553
And I don't want any of your
hockey goons messing up my ice.

07:56.680 --> 08:00.798
Hey, those hockey goons
are helping to pay for this ice.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.872
-She'll never go.
-She'll go.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.598
Hey.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.675
Where the hell are my skates?

08:52.360 --> 08:53.588
-Good workout?
-No.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.155
The gym was a total joke.
Then I tried to do some laps--

08:56.360 --> 09:00.512
Vacation, Jack.
Muscles are supposed to atrophy.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.554
Just look at Elisa. Her butt
was rock hard before we got here.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.353
Listen, guys, I'm sorry
if I've been kind of a bitch lately.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.350
Oh, come on, I've been horrible.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.870
Oh, we know. I was just shocked
that you said " kind of" when it's....

09:19.080 --> 09:20.957
Yeah, pretty much been full-on.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.799
But it's okay. We know
what you've been going through.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.110
Plus, we said terrible things
behind your back.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.390
So it's just like junior nationals
all over again.

09:29.600 --> 09:30.953
I am still bitter.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.798
Can I get you ladies anything?

09:33.480 --> 09:35.038
You're that skating girl, aren't you?

09:35.480 --> 09:37.710
Yes, "Skating Girl."
That's my superhero name.

09:38.120 --> 09:41.032
I don't watch a whole lot of skating,
but even I saw you wipe out.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.834
Man, that had to hurt.
They showed that, like, all the time.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.235
Yeah, it's my own
personal agony of defeat.

09:46.440 --> 09:47.998
-Jackie.
-So, what are you doing...

09:48.200 --> 09:49.872
...now that you're retired?

09:50.920 --> 09:52.956
-I'm not retired.
-Hey, Sparky...

09:53.160 --> 09:54.912
...why don't you bring us
another round...

09:55.120 --> 09:57.759
...with an extra splash of tact
this time.

09:58.480 --> 09:59.993
Thanks.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.317
Boy, pose for the cover
of one Wheaties box, you know?

10:06.560 --> 10:08.949
-I'm getting out of here.
-Come on, Jackie. Come on.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.755
No, just let her go.
I think she just needs to be alone.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.712
Yeah, it's not all she needs.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.115
Of course, I'm too much of a lady
to say what.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.833
No, you're not.

10:19.040 --> 10:22.396
True. Sad but true.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.433
Thank you.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.798
You gotta get out there, man.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.958
It's nice and tight
with just a little curve.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.355
We got a little bit of that
around here too.

12:14.560 --> 12:18.439
-Oh, yeah? What's the story?
-I don't know.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.280
-Anybody try?
-Shot down three of our finest.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.469
She's a lot tougher
than she looks, man.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.680
-You going in?
-No.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.916
I think I'll let her come to me.

13:00.880 --> 13:01.915
Hey.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.834
-I wouldn't go out there if I were you.
-Really? And why not?

13:08.520 --> 13:10.351
Well, it's kind of rough.

13:11.160 --> 13:14.357
-You didn't seem to have a problem.
-There's an undertow.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.917
I think I can handle it.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.190
It looked like your top
was about to come undone.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.469
Dude.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.199
Will you give that back?

13:51.640 --> 13:55.030
You want me to come in there,
or you wanna come out here?

13:55.360 --> 13:56.873
Give that back.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.232
Keep your eyes closed.
Are they closed?

14:03.440 --> 14:05.431
They're closed. Hurry up.

14:05.640 --> 14:09.269
-All right, I'm almost finished.
-Come on, already.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.994
Okay, you can open up
your eyes now.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.518
Heads up.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.516
I tried to warn you.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.320
-Hi. Alex.
-Jackie.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.352
You wouldn't dare. No. No.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.875
-I should give that kid a buck.
-Only a buck?

15:02.840 --> 15:05.354
So you ever
been on skates before?

15:05.560 --> 15:07.516
Wondered if you knew or not.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.309
Wondered what?
If you'd ever been on blades before?

15:10.520 --> 15:14.229
No. I just wondered
if you knew how to skate or not.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.632
Yeah, a little.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.115
A little.

15:32.320 --> 15:34.550
Come on, I'll have you doing it
in no time. It's easy.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.234
I don't know....

15:47.800 --> 15:49.597
Looks kind of scary.

15:56.840 --> 16:00.150
Oh, no. No, no.
See, you'd have to have a death wish.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.237
No, but it helps.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.590
-All right, wait here. I'll be right back.
-Alex.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.558
Hey, Alex.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.234
Alex.

17:04.839 --> 17:07.035
-Hey, thanks for the helmet, bro.
-No problem, Alex.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.800
That was amazing.
How could you ever learn to do that?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.638
-Yeah, well....
-Can I have your autograph, please?

17:12.839 --> 17:14.034
Sure.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.752
-What's the name?
-Kayla.

17:17.960 --> 17:18.994
All right, Kayla.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.590
-Here you go.
-Can I see that?

17:27.880 --> 17:30.474
I know, I know.
It's a horrible picture.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.512
Thank you.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.234
-See you later.
-Come on, sweetie, let's go.

17:37.440 --> 17:41.069
Will you let me go. Gosh.

17:41.280 --> 17:42.793
Okay, so go on.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.992
So then I decided to turn pro
and medalled at the X Games.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.430
" Pro"? As in " professional"?

17:48.640 --> 17:51.837
-You do this for a living?
-Yeah. More or less.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.349
I'm actually signing
with a new sponsor this week.

17:54.560 --> 17:56.676
I was supposed to meet up with them
this morning...

17:56.880 --> 17:58.711
...but the waves just looked
too damn good.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.434
So good. It's a good thing
you're so damn irresponsible.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.676
Otherwise we would've never met.

18:04.320 --> 18:05.912
Works for me.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.920
Here's to being irresponsible.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.631
-You promise?
-I promise.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.158
-No, do you really promise?
-I really promise.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.072
All right.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.752
She promised.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.632
He's just--
He's hard to describe.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.671
Which is odd,
because you've done nothing...

18:55.880 --> 18:57.836
...but describe him
for the last three hours.

18:58.040 --> 19:01.032
I know.
But there's just something about him.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.596
Maybe it's the fact he doesn't spend
all day in a leotard and a dancebelt.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.633
-Maybe it's his tattoos. He has three.
-There she is.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.673
-That you've seen.
-Yes, that I've seen.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.916
I can't believe you haven't told him
who you are.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.838
I will. It's just....

19:15.040 --> 19:16.553
You know, for once, it was just--

19:16.760 --> 19:20.150
It was nice. There was no agenda.
It was just a girl meeting a boy.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.352
And it was nice.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.358
I don't even know how you can try
and say that without blushing.

19:27.560 --> 19:30.233
Luanne and Elisa, my friends.

19:32.680 --> 19:33.954
Any chance we get
to meet him?

19:34.160 --> 19:36.833
Yeah, there's a very good chance
that you could meet him.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.199
That's him.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.318
-Here you go.
-Thank you very much, sir.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.078
All right, have a good one.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.874
Alex?

19:55.400 --> 19:58.039
You really clean up.
What are you doing here?

19:58.240 --> 19:59.468
We're staying here.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.910
These are my friends,
Luanne and Elisa.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.554
-Ladies.
-Alex.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.556
Oh, this is obviously
the "more or less" part of my life.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.635
I don't know what else to say.
Can I get you your car?

20:12.840 --> 20:14.717
No. No, no. We're good.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.110
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

20:22.080 --> 20:25.709
You know, I'm just surprised
to see you here, that's all.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.117
Well, I guess we all
have our secrets.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.880
Excuse me.
I've been waiting five minutes.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.913
-I'm in the middle of something.
-I should really just go, because--

20:34.120 --> 20:35.155
There's this party.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.397
-But listen, I'll see you later, okay?
-Jackie....

20:47.720 --> 20:49.199
Excuse me.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.870
Here, knock yourself out.
It's on level five.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.671
I didn't think you'd come.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.918
Well, I promised, didn't I?

21:20.560 --> 21:23.632
Look, I'm sorry
about how I acted earlier.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.479
It was rude and immature
and I apologize.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.794
Why didn't you just tell me
who you really are?

21:33.000 --> 21:36.675
Well, I should have.
But it's like you said...

21:36.880 --> 21:39.030
...everyone's entitled
to their secrets, right?

21:39.720 --> 21:41.631
So did you and your friends
have a good laugh?

21:41.840 --> 21:43.831
Don't go acting all wounded.
I said I was sorry.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.873
Sorry you let me walk around
all day acting like a big idiot...

21:47.080 --> 21:49.594
-...thinking you're all impressed?
-Yes. But I was impressed.

21:49.800 --> 21:53.270
And you didn't start acting like an idiot
until two minutes ago.

21:53.480 --> 21:57.155
See, now, this is why I didn't tell you.
I knew you would act all intimidated.

21:57.760 --> 22:01.958
Intimidated? By you?
Hey, look, don't flatter yourself.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.628
Flitting around on the ice
is not exactly a real sport.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.274
Oh, my God,
you wouldn't even last five minutes.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.754
Because you're embarrassed...

22:08.960 --> 22:11.076
...don't take it out on me.
I work incredibly hard.

22:11.280 --> 22:12.952
Maybe.
But I wonder where you'd be...

22:13.160 --> 22:15.116
...if your parents
hadn't won a gold medal...

22:15.320 --> 22:18.790
...and built you a world-famous sports
complex to go play ice princess in.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.195
Listen, you little arrogant jerk...

22:21.400 --> 22:24.472
...everything that I have ever won,
I have earned by working my ass off.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.398
I have skated until my ankles bled.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.398
I have woken up at 4:30
every morning for seven years.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.956
And until my accident,
I did not miss one practice. Not one.

22:34.560 --> 22:37.199
Well, it sounds like
you need to get out a little more.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.038
That's-- That's really great advice.

22:39.240 --> 22:41.549
Especially coming from
a professional athlete.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.988
Well, I might just be an amateur,
but I can tell you one thing:

22:47.680 --> 22:50.513
You won't get anywhere just waiting
for the waves to come in.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.075
I guess it just depends
on where you wanna go.

22:53.320 --> 22:55.914
And I don't think you have a clue.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.672
So don't blame me because
I know what I want out of life.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.678
And what I don't.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.760
I guess I don't need to ask
about your trip.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.395
Well, if sweetness and light
was what you expected...

23:30.600 --> 23:33.990
-...I'd ask for my money back.
-Jackie.

23:36.480 --> 23:40.359
Look, Dad.
I know what you're gonna say.

23:41.280 --> 23:42.429
And the answer is--

23:42.640 --> 23:46.713
No. You listen. If I don't have
a sponsor, then I can't go on the tour.

23:46.920 --> 23:50.390
I need you to call them back and tell
them they're idiots if they pass up.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.034
There's a lot
of other companies willing to--

23:53.240 --> 23:54.992
Unreliable?

23:55.200 --> 23:58.078
You know what--? Forget it.
You know what you can tell them?

23:59.640 --> 24:01.119
Got that?!

24:05.000 --> 24:06.718
Phone's broken.

24:07.560 --> 24:11.473
-How's your manager?
-Ex-manager.

24:11.680 --> 24:15.195
Apparently, extreme sports
isn't a place for "slackers."

24:15.400 --> 24:17.595
Damn. I knew I should've gotten
that M.B.A.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.279
Jackie Dorsey.
Jackie, how's the leg?

24:19.480 --> 24:21.277
My skating's back to where
it used to be....

24:21.480 --> 24:22.833
Isn't that your girlfriend?

24:23.040 --> 24:25.600
It's doubtful if I'll ever be able
to do a triple again.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.759
Girlfriend, angel of darkness.
Yeah, that's her.

24:30.280 --> 24:34.068
-I don't let my dreams die that easily.
-Of course, of course.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.629
Does this mean your Olympic hopes
are still alive?

24:36.880 --> 24:38.472
I'm making the shift over to pairs.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.478
It's just as demanding, but there's
less emphasis on the jumps.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.148
I'm guessing all you need now
is a partner. Any luck?

24:44.360 --> 24:46.396
I'm actually interviewing
with skaters this week.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.591
If there's anyone
who wants to skate with me...

24:48.800 --> 24:49.915
...you know who to contact.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.918
That girl's gotta catch a clue.
It's over for her.

24:53.120 --> 24:56.032
I don't know, man.
She knows what she wants.

24:56.240 --> 24:57.798
Something tells me
she's gonna get it.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.198
Well, I know what I want.
Another beer. You?

25:03.400 --> 25:05.391
No. No, I'm good. Thanks.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.677
It's my first day on ice skates.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.152
No kidding.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.353
No.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.035
Toepick.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.398
Thanks, girls. Thank you.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.074
Swell.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.713
So. Where did you dig this one up?

27:24.080 --> 27:26.753
I didn't. He found us.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.951
Jackie, this is Alex Harrison.

27:29.200 --> 27:31.634
Alex, this is my daughter, Jackie.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.353
What the hell are you doing here?

27:33.560 --> 27:35.949
Oh, real nice.
Can't even muster a hello?

27:36.160 --> 27:38.674
-I just flew 3000 miles to be here.
-This is not happening.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.677
I'm not surprised
you don't have a partner.

27:40.880 --> 27:44.475
-lf this is your way of apologizing--
-lf anyone should be apologizing--

27:47.880 --> 27:50.678
Well, apparently you already
know each other.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.108
Apparently.

27:52.320 --> 27:54.231
Look, I don't know
what's going on here...

27:54.440 --> 27:58.069
...and I'm not exactly sure
I even wanna know.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.918
But are you or are you not
here for a tryout?

28:02.160 --> 28:04.116
Yes, I'm here to try out.
It's my dream.

28:04.320 --> 28:06.880
Oh, please.
He doesn't even know how to skate.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.118
A little unconventional.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.517
-Who trains you?
-Actually, I'm kind of...

29:03.720 --> 29:05.119
...in between coaches right now.

29:05.320 --> 29:08.596
Although, Evelyn Jean, she's 7,
gave me a few pointers on my Lutz.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.552
She can be a real ballbuster.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.551
He just started figure skating
three months ago.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.830
He's doing some
inline skating for the X Games--

29:16.040 --> 29:17.439
Why are you even talking to him?

29:17.640 --> 29:20.108
Don't you understand?
He's just here to humiliate me.

29:20.320 --> 29:22.788
-You really need my help for that?
-Honey...

29:23.000 --> 29:26.276
-...he came all this way.
-Yeah, Jackie.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.279
Fine.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.271
Ready? On three.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.630
Wait. Right foot first?

29:45.160 --> 29:47.879
It's not like you're some big expert
on it either, all right?

29:48.080 --> 29:49.877
Yes, right foot.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.435
One, two, three.

29:56.520 --> 29:59.159
Okay, nice and easy.
Just get to know each other.

30:00.160 --> 30:03.277
I guess you don't tell your mother
everything, huh?

30:08.720 --> 30:11.359
You know, you're just making a fool
out of yourself.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.915
I was afraid
you wouldn't recognize me.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.112
How could I forget?

30:25.920 --> 30:28.559
What happened?
No jobs at the Roller Derby?

30:28.760 --> 30:31.069
I heard you were having trouble
looking for a partner.

30:31.280 --> 30:33.271
I drew the short straw.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.510
You're kind of cute
when you get all mad.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.518
-Your face gets all red and puffy.
-I do not get red...

30:40.720 --> 30:42.711
...and puffy, you slacker.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.558
Princess.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.316
There. Satisfied?

30:49.520 --> 30:52.239
I think you look good together.

30:58.280 --> 30:59.315
Jackie, wait.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.080
You don't really expect me
to skate with that, do you?

31:02.280 --> 31:03.872
Tell me what happened
in California.

31:04.080 --> 31:06.594
-Nothing happened in California.
-Then why is he here?

31:06.800 --> 31:09.598
I don't know. He loves the pageantry
of it all. How should I know?

31:09.800 --> 31:11.870
-This has nothing to do with me.
-He quit his job.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.513
So? He used to park people's cars.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.995
-He taught himself to skate.
-You call that skating?

31:16.200 --> 31:18.794
I do. That's the whole reason
we're having this conversation.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.752
The guy is a natural.
He seems strong.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.190
-He doesn't have bad habits.
-Wait till you know him.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.279
And the two of you
could learn pairs together.

31:26.480 --> 31:29.199
He might just be what it is
we've been looking for.

31:29.400 --> 31:33.598
-But the two of you have got to--
-There is no two of us.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.276
Okay, fine. Sorry.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.835
We'll just say,
"Thanks but no, thanks."

31:40.040 --> 31:41.553
Well, good.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.876
If that's really what you want.

31:56.680 --> 32:00.309
You can stay. But we finish working
when I say we're done.

32:00.520 --> 32:04.115
And the first day you go looking
for waves, you are out of here.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.834
Cool.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.873
Closer.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.069
Closer.

32:18.280 --> 32:21.750
Mom, any closer and he's gonna
owe us two camels and a goat.

32:22.240 --> 32:25.516
Skating in pairs is about harmony.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.275
It's about two skaters
coming together as one.

32:29.720 --> 32:33.190
It's a balance of strength
and grace...

32:33.400 --> 32:34.992
...athleticism...

32:35.200 --> 32:37.111
...and artistry.

32:37.960 --> 32:40.030
You ready to do this?

32:41.760 --> 32:43.432
-Just try not to get in my way.
-Okay.

32:43.640 --> 32:44.868
Go.

32:50.280 --> 32:54.319
Sorry. I guess I was too busy
admiring your artistry.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.235
Toepick.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.229
Alex....

33:28.440 --> 33:30.078
Alex, no.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.473
Alex.

33:53.840 --> 33:55.671
Alex. Alex.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.199
What is the matter with you?

34:02.400 --> 34:04.960
What's the matter with me?
My hand was right here.

34:05.160 --> 34:08.630
Yeah, that does me a lot of good,
seeing as my hands were here.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.840
Okay. Well, maybe next time
you'll get it right.

34:12.280 --> 34:17.114
Hey, didn't you give them the whole
harmony, artistry, two-as-one speech?

34:18.520 --> 34:20.317
Keep up the good work.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.358
You dropped yourself.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.277
Get off me.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.510
-You can't be serious.
-Very serious.

34:34.719 --> 34:37.792
The two of you need to learn to stop
competing with each other...

34:38.000 --> 34:39.672
...and getting in each other's way.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.599
Yeah, well, if Moon Doggie over here
learned to pay attention....

34:42.800 --> 34:46.031
You both need to learn to respect
what each other is doing.

34:46.239 --> 34:47.992
Anticipate their movements.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.918
Right now
I'm anticipating a broken nose...

34:50.120 --> 34:51.632
...if we don't tie down those elbows.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.751
You don't expect us to skate
like this, do you?

34:53.960 --> 34:55.837
Yeah. And not only skate...

34:56.040 --> 35:00.238
...but live every waking hour like that
until I say it comes off.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.557
I feel like I need a shower, huh?

35:03.760 --> 35:07.639
Mom.
Listen, he's just gonna drag me down.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.439
Get off me.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.317
Hey, hey, hey--

35:43.080 --> 35:44.354
Hey, Alex.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.709
Alex.

35:45.920 --> 35:49.913
You get your hands off me right now.
Get off of me.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.317
Mom.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.512
How come we never had to do that?

35:54.720 --> 35:56.790
You were easier to train.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.553
I'll get it.

36:14.120 --> 36:15.348
This is never going to work.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.156
Alex, come on.

37:29.920 --> 37:32.150
Alex, come on,
it cannot be that bad.

37:32.360 --> 37:33.554
Yes, it is.

37:33.760 --> 37:39.596
Everything is all wrist snaps and
arched backs and eyebrow raises.

37:41.040 --> 37:44.828
Sprinkles. Sprinkles.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.598
Okay, so I guess it is that bad.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.916
I'm assuming
that you have a suggestion.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.998
I'm suggesting we need
some more ass-kicking.

38:17.640 --> 38:21.428
Technical merit, 5.0.

38:21.800 --> 38:25.429
Artistic interpretation, 5.2.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.111
Ass-kicking, 6.0.

38:43.160 --> 38:44.798
Isn't that how you won
all those medals?

38:45.480 --> 38:49.268
Yeah, well, I think my mom's afraid
I might get hurt again.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.789
I won't let you get hurt. I promise.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.634
Alex.

39:05.320 --> 39:06.912
That needs some work.

39:07.120 --> 39:10.237
I don't know,
I kind of liked the landing.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.877
You know, we were just working on
a new move.

39:18.360 --> 39:21.557
I'll be curious to see what the judges
think of that last move.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.270
Lock up when you're done...

39:25.640 --> 39:27.312
...practicing.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.470
-I'm--
-Get off me.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.111
Are you warm enough?
You wanna go inside?

39:45.320 --> 39:47.595
-No, I'm good.
-All right.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.910
I'm sorry about what I said
on the beach that night.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.032
-Don't worry about it.
-No, let me finish.

39:55.240 --> 39:57.629
-It's not a big deal.
-Will you let me finish?

39:59.040 --> 40:00.996
I shouldn't have judged you...

40:01.200 --> 40:02.633
...like that.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.718
I was wrong, and I apologize.

40:07.040 --> 40:10.191
Thank you. Apology accepted.

40:14.600 --> 40:17.273
So isn't there something
you wanna say back?

40:18.280 --> 40:19.679
No. No, I'm good.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.038
Don't get mad at me.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.958
You were a complete bitch.

40:25.160 --> 40:26.434
You know, you--

40:26.640 --> 40:28.949
-You're impossible.
-It's part of my charm.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.151
You were right
about one thing, though.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.669
-What's that?
-I just...

40:35.880 --> 40:38.314
...needed to figure out
what I wanted out of life.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.118
How's that working out for you?

40:41.960 --> 40:43.518
You tell me.

40:48.680 --> 40:52.958
-Okay, well, that was awkward.
-Let's get out of here. Come on.

40:53.160 --> 40:54.752
-What are you--?
-Let's go somewhere.

40:54.960 --> 40:56.951
-Right now?
-Yeah, we'll have an adventure.

40:57.160 --> 41:00.596
Come on. We could drive down
to Boston or to the cape.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.916
I've never seen
the Atlantic Ocean before.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.754
I'll let you drive.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.513
I knew it. I just knew it.

41:06.720 --> 41:09.234
-Knew what? What's the matter?
-Regionals are in six weeks.

41:09.440 --> 41:12.000
Ten minutes ago, you were talking
about changing our routine.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.634
Our jumps are a disaster,
our death spiral--

41:14.840 --> 41:16.353
Calm down.

41:16.560 --> 41:18.596
I'm not going anywhere.

41:18.800 --> 41:22.554
-Sorry, guess I misread the moment.
-No. Look, you did not--

41:22.760 --> 41:24.955
You did not misread the moment.
I'm sorry.

41:25.160 --> 41:27.594
But every practice just means
so much right now.

41:28.640 --> 41:30.232
That's right, I forgot.

41:30.600 --> 41:34.309
Eye on prize. Can't lose focus.
Win at all cost, yeah.

41:35.080 --> 41:38.356
-Alex--
-No more apologies, please.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.233
You're right.
You're 100 percent right.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.999
I'm going to bed.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.116
Quick question.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.439
Have you ever done one stupid,
passionate...

41:54.640 --> 41:57.200
...spontaneous thing
in your whole life?

41:59.680 --> 42:02.319
Yeah. That's kind of what I thought.

42:27.400 --> 42:30.597
-lf you're that worried about him--
-What? No, I'm not....

42:30.920 --> 42:33.753
Why would I be? I'm not his keeper.

42:34.560 --> 42:36.755
His alarm probably didn't go off,
that's all.

42:36.960 --> 42:39.349
It's not like he drove off
in the middle of the night...

42:39.560 --> 42:42.358
...to see Boston
or the Atlantic Ocean, right?

42:43.280 --> 42:44.554
Right.

42:45.880 --> 42:48.030
But, you know, just to be sure....

42:48.680 --> 42:50.830
You know how Mom gets
when we're late for practice.

43:00.320 --> 43:01.878
Hey, Alex.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.958
Alex? Hello? Are you here?

43:20.920 --> 43:23.195
I'll give you spontaneous.

43:26.440 --> 43:27.998
Surprise.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.799
Surprise.

43:33.200 --> 43:34.155
No.

43:42.920 --> 43:44.751
Looking for this?

43:45.960 --> 43:48.474
Wait, I still have shampoo
in my hair.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.438
Hello?

44:11.880 --> 44:14.075
Morning. Sorry, overslept.

44:14.600 --> 44:17.990
-Hope everything's not too cold here.
-More like frigid.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.754
Oh, my God.
This place is fabulous.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.315
Jackie, this is an old friend of mine,
Heidi Clements.

44:24.520 --> 44:26.875
So nice to meet you.
Alex talks about you constantly.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.435
-Oh, that's funny, because he never--
-She just...

44:29.640 --> 44:31.676
...kind of showed up last night.

44:32.080 --> 44:34.674
Just wandering through wilds
of northern Connecticut?

44:34.880 --> 44:36.154
Heidi is a model.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.036
As if that explains everything.

44:39.240 --> 44:43.472
I was in New York for Fashion Week.
So exhausting and stressful.

44:43.680 --> 44:47.229
I can imagine.
All that clothes-changing and smiling.

44:47.440 --> 44:49.670
So I thought I'd drive up
and surprise Alex.

44:49.880 --> 44:52.235
-Surprise.
-Oh, how carefree...

44:52.440 --> 44:55.079
...and spontaneous of you.

44:55.280 --> 44:57.316
I guess that--
That's what old friends do.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.478
You know, when they're not playing
Find the Soap.

45:04.200 --> 45:06.395
That was fun.
We should do it again.

45:06.600 --> 45:08.955
But you know what,
we're already late.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.356
So if you're not too tired....

45:11.800 --> 45:13.631
-I gotta get going.
-Can't I stay and watch?

45:13.840 --> 45:15.512
I won't say a word, I swear.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.438
Please. Just for a minute?

45:24.040 --> 45:25.189
She seems sweet.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.799
-Do you mean that?
-No.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.594
She really is an old friend,
we grew up surfing together.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.518
Didn't ask. Don't care.

45:35.040 --> 45:37.918
Yes. We dated on and off
for a couple years, okay?

45:49.640 --> 45:51.995
But I didn't say anything
because last time I saw her...

45:52.200 --> 45:53.428
...I thought we'd broken up.

45:53.680 --> 45:56.478
Guess it didn't stick.
Is that before or after we met?

46:12.800 --> 46:14.552
You are such a dog.

46:14.760 --> 46:17.115
Oh, my God.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.789
That was unbelievable.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.878
That was the funniest thing
I have ever seen.

46:23.640 --> 46:27.349
I mean, you were good.
So good, really. But, Alex...

46:27.560 --> 46:31.189
...oh, my God,
if anyone back home ever saw you....

46:38.800 --> 46:41.598
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:41.800 --> 46:45.156
I'm sorry. But, Alex,
come on, you can't be serious.

46:45.360 --> 46:48.318
-This is a joke, right?
-No, it's not a joke.

46:49.080 --> 46:50.752
Maybe it started out that way.

46:50.960 --> 46:52.712
-I don't know.
-This isn't your world.

46:52.920 --> 46:55.309
You spent your whole life
making fun of people like this.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.039
I know.

46:57.400 --> 46:58.799
It's weird.

47:00.040 --> 47:02.395
What's going on? Seriously.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.192
What do you want me to say?

47:04.400 --> 47:06.994
I like it, okay?
That's the whole answer.

47:07.200 --> 47:10.909
I like working hard.
I like challenging myself. I like....

47:11.720 --> 47:14.553
I like being part of something
for a change.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.433
And the girl?

47:19.920 --> 47:21.239
Do you like the girl?

47:22.680 --> 47:23.999
Yeah.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.992
Yeah, I like the girl.

47:27.200 --> 47:28.315
Okay.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.159
Think I'm gonna go.

47:43.720 --> 47:45.631
You know it's never gonna work.

47:47.240 --> 47:48.559
Yeah, I know.

48:06.120 --> 48:07.838
I'm sorry about that.
She tends to talk...

48:08.040 --> 48:10.156
...before she even thinks
about what--

48:10.600 --> 48:11.999
What's going on?

48:24.080 --> 48:26.150
-Yes.
-She just do a triple?

48:27.080 --> 48:28.229
Baby.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.473
-God, that felt good.
-That was incredible.

48:32.760 --> 48:34.671
But how? When did you--?

48:34.880 --> 48:37.110
I've been working on it
every morning before practice.

48:37.320 --> 48:39.470
-And it finally just came together.
-See?

48:39.680 --> 48:41.716
What do doctors or fathers know?

48:41.920 --> 48:43.353
And the leg?

48:43.880 --> 48:45.154
Never better.

48:47.080 --> 48:49.674
That just felt so good.
I wanna do, like, a hundred more.

48:49.880 --> 48:51.757
You know,
I haven't been able to do one since.

48:51.960 --> 48:54.235
Yeah, I know, you mentioned it.
Congratulations.

48:57.120 --> 49:00.032
So, what's the deal?
I thought we had all this work to do.

49:07.880 --> 49:10.792
-Where's your cheering section?
-She retired.

49:23.080 --> 49:26.709
Competition should be intense
at today's northeast regionals.

49:26.920 --> 49:29.992
But, of course, every eye will be
on the wild-card team...

49:30.200 --> 49:33.795
...of two-time national singles champ
Jacqueline Dorsey...

49:34.000 --> 49:37.993
...and her partner Alex Harrison,
making his competitive debut.

49:56.800 --> 50:00.429
Doesn't look like people are too
happy that we've crashed their party.

50:00.640 --> 50:03.677
Don't let them get to you.
They're just trying to psych you out.

50:04.320 --> 50:08.313
Yeah, I'd be hostile too if I had to skate
around looking like a freaking pinata.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.396
-Nice.
-Sorry.

50:15.280 --> 50:18.317
What the hell are you looking at?
Huh, Fabio?

50:19.520 --> 50:23.035
They're just staring at the monitor.
You're standing right in front of it.

50:26.920 --> 50:28.148
Sorry.

50:35.800 --> 50:39.679
This couple has such nice lines
and a lot of personality.

50:39.880 --> 50:42.440
They're known for their colourful
choreography.

51:15.480 --> 51:18.233
A perfectly executed lasso lift.

51:18.440 --> 51:20.476
They're definitely gonna be
a tough pair to beat.

51:30.120 --> 51:31.553
What are you doing?

51:32.040 --> 51:33.632
I'm getting pumped.

51:34.360 --> 51:36.476
You know that this
is figure skating, right?

51:36.720 --> 51:38.358
How come no one's chanting?

51:38.600 --> 51:40.795
At the X Games, people always chant.
I mean, come on.

51:41.440 --> 51:44.637
-Yes, I'll see what I can do.
-Ladies and gentlemen, next up...

51:44.840 --> 51:47.957
...Jackie Dorsey and Alex Harrison.

51:48.160 --> 51:50.276
-You ready?
-Yeah, let's do this.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.958
After a standout performance
in today's short program...

52:45.160 --> 52:48.391
...newcomers Dorsey and Harrison
will enter tomorrow's long program...

52:48.600 --> 52:49.919
...in second position.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.508
Hey, nice.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.512
Nice Lutz for a guy
with a police record.

53:01.720 --> 53:04.632
-Yeah, nice talk for a guy with a--
-Hey, you know what, will you--?

53:04.880 --> 53:08.156
Do not let him get to you. Sit.

53:11.760 --> 53:13.876
You really have a police record?

53:14.920 --> 53:17.036
-What do you think?
-A long one?

53:20.040 --> 53:21.837
Oh, what the hell is this crap?

53:24.080 --> 53:27.436
If you don't mind,
we're watching this.

53:31.280 --> 53:33.669
Well, then, I'm sure you won't mind
if I change it.

53:34.440 --> 53:37.591
-Buddy, we don't want any trouble.
-Alex.

53:37.880 --> 53:39.632
Hey, Sparky.

53:40.600 --> 53:42.397
Not a big skating fan, huh?

53:42.600 --> 53:44.477
Okay, buddy, this ain't your fight.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.159
Come on, you should try it.

53:46.360 --> 53:49.636
See, we spend our day putting
our hands in places I'm guessing...

53:49.840 --> 53:52.149
-...you could only dream about.
-Nice.

53:53.200 --> 53:56.317
See, check it out.
That's a replay of Pinata's final lift.

53:56.840 --> 53:59.513
-Hey, nice job, by the way.
-Thanks.

53:59.720 --> 54:02.109
I'm gonna say this once,
just move it.

54:02.320 --> 54:04.788
But I can't figure out how...

54:05.000 --> 54:07.195
...you get so much distance
on your throw.

54:07.480 --> 54:09.869
Now, I know you got
the one hand here...

54:10.440 --> 54:14.718
-...and the other hand here?
-No. That's close. It's more like here.

54:14.920 --> 54:16.478
-Okay.
-And then here.

54:17.560 --> 54:20.757
-Then you just let her fly.
-That's my favourite part.

54:25.640 --> 54:27.790
I don't know.
The landing needs work.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.468
You can't expect to get it perfect
your first time.

54:30.680 --> 54:32.636
Alex. Alex. Alex.

54:32.840 --> 54:34.637
Chanting, gotta love it.

54:34.840 --> 54:36.159
Morning, Pinata.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.396
Hey, Blade Boy.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.715
I was just trying to come up
with a nickname for you.

54:43.040 --> 54:45.349
-Yeah, keep trying.
-After your performance...

54:45.560 --> 54:48.028
-Your girl's on.
-...I just have to say, "What accident?"

54:48.240 --> 54:51.755
I'm very lucky. I've never felt better
in my whole career.

54:51.960 --> 54:54.713
There's a rumour floating around
that your triple axel has also...

54:54.920 --> 54:57.434
-...never look ed better.
-Now, who told you that?

54:57.640 --> 55:01.315
I know that an individual Olympic gold
has always been the dream.

55:01.520 --> 55:03.511
Yes, but that's not why
I'm here today.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.392
But you're not ruling it out.

55:05.600 --> 55:06.953
I never rule anything out.

55:07.280 --> 55:08.952
Nothing will mak e
your fans happier...

55:09.160 --> 55:10.991
... than a return
to individual competition.

55:11.200 --> 55:14.351
If things don't go well today, could
it be a solo trip for Jackie Dorsey...

55:14.560 --> 55:16.471
... to the next Olympic games?

55:16.680 --> 55:18.238
I....

55:20.960 --> 55:24.350
I just know that I won't be happy
until I have a medal around my neck.

55:26.280 --> 55:28.953
-Bye. Thank you.
-Thank you.

55:29.160 --> 55:30.832
Pinata, can you take a look?

55:31.040 --> 55:33.713
I think I got an ice skate
wedged in my back.

55:55.560 --> 55:58.393
Jackie, no one's seen him yet.

55:58.600 --> 56:00.909
I knew something like this
was gonna happen. I knew it.

56:01.320 --> 56:03.151
He is so irresponsible.

56:23.040 --> 56:26.157
Yes, I am well aware of the rules.
I am on the rules committee.

56:26.360 --> 56:28.635
And I am telling you,
you can change the order...

56:28.840 --> 56:31.195
-...at any time if one of its--
-Excuse me.

56:31.400 --> 56:33.595
-Never mind.
-Excuse me, could we get through?

56:34.600 --> 56:36.511
Where in the hell--?

56:36.720 --> 56:39.792
Okay, there's no time for this. Listen,
you got about 10 seconds, okay?

56:40.000 --> 56:42.230
Just try to relax.
Take a deep breath.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.749
-I think that's more for me than you.
-What, no pumping?

56:44.960 --> 56:47.838
-Don't worry, I'm pumped.
-Ladies and gentlemen, next up...

56:48.040 --> 56:50.429
...Alex Harrison
and Jacqueline Dorsey.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.278
Go. Go.

57:03.520 --> 57:05.715
What the hell
is the matter with you?

57:24.040 --> 57:26.679
I can't believe it. I've never seen
anything like this before.

57:26.880 --> 57:31.112
-Alex Harrison just did a triple.
-Yeah, it's a--

57:31.600 --> 57:34.398
I don't know what's going on out there,
but I'm guessing...

57:34.600 --> 57:37.114
...he's just a little overenthusiastic.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.959
They've got another double
coming up in just a minute.

57:40.160 --> 57:41.593
-I'm doing another triple.
-Alex.

57:41.800 --> 57:44.792
-You might wanna try it.
-Alex, I can't do it.

57:53.880 --> 57:55.916
Jackie Dorsey has just fallen.

57:59.400 --> 58:01.277
Get up, baby. Get up.

58:12.360 --> 58:14.920
Never say I was the one
who wouldn't follow through.

58:45.800 --> 58:47.472
He's not coming back.

58:47.960 --> 58:49.439
He'll be back.

58:51.480 --> 58:53.436
No, he won't. I know him.

58:54.400 --> 58:58.029
It wasn't your fault. His behaviour
was completely inexcusable.

58:58.240 --> 58:59.958
Mine wasn't too great either.

59:00.680 --> 59:02.557
We all say things to reporters,
sweetie.

59:03.520 --> 59:06.318
Something about the lights.
He'll understand.

59:07.920 --> 59:10.195
Nationals are in two months.

59:10.400 --> 59:12.436
If there is any possibility
of you competing...

59:12.640 --> 59:14.392
...we have
to start training immediately.

59:15.040 --> 59:16.268
As an individual?

59:16.840 --> 59:18.159
As an individual.

59:19.040 --> 59:20.758
Is that really what you want?

59:23.000 --> 59:24.149
Yes.

59:27.240 --> 59:28.639
Yes.

59:34.440 --> 59:36.476
-I don't believe her.
-Yeah, well, don't worry...

59:36.680 --> 59:38.671
...she doesn't believe her either.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.559
Beautiful.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.236
I didn't see you were there.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.951
So graceful.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:33.194
You always remind me
of your mother.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.919
You know...

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.638
...no amount of medals
could ever make me love you more.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.159
I know, Daddy.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:45.634
So...

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.839
...how did it feel?

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.079
Lonely.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.037
What are you doing here?

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.277
-What do you think I'm doing here?
-Wasting your time, for one thing.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.115
The trials are in eight weeks,
I don't have time to waste.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.038
Why you doing this?

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.233
Let's just leave it at it didn't work out
between us, okay?

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.795
I think we both kind of knew
it wouldn't.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:45.316
Please don't give up on us
just because I made a mistake.

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:49.513
" Us"? I think you made it pretty clear
there is no " us."

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.071
Just go home, Jackie.
You don't need me.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.872
You never needed me.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.911
So don't do it for me.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.669
Problem is I don't really care
all that much about medals.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.030
Well, what do you care about?

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.593
Today?

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.272
-Just the waves.
-Alex....

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.759
Alex.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.039
Excuse me.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.870
I'll bring it right back. I swear.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.158
You're wrong.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.115
-What the hell are you doing?
-You're wrong.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.515
I could've never
done this without you.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.438
Jackie, turn around.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.278
Not till you agree
to come back with me.

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.913
Jackie, turn around.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.235
Alex!

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.079
Jackie.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.838
Jackie.

01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:06.674
Jackie.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.319
Jackie!

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.479
What's the matter with you?
You're acting like a spoiled brat.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.272
Afraid you wouldn't recognize me.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.719
You're not gonna make me
go back out there, are you?

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.591
You really would, wouldn't you?

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:55.030
-God, are you pigheaded.
-It's just part of my charm.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.674
All right, look...

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.112
...if I come back, things are gonna
have to be different between us.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:08.719
-A lot of things have changed.
-Alex, nothing has changed.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.159
Heidi and I got back together.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.596
We're talking about getting married.

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.239
She's moving in this weekend.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.717
Congratulations.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.638
Come on,
I know you don't mean that.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.511
She and I just make sense.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.473
-We understand each other.
-You don't have to explain yourself.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.393
Oh, so that's it?

01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.798
Isn't there anything you wanna say,
anything you wanna know?

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.679
All I care about is if you
can be on that ice tomorrow morning.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.589
Well, you didn't leave yourself
much time.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.149
I didn't realize I needed it.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.958
I'm home.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.593
How'd it go?

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.153
Mission accomplished.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.271
Have a nice break?

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.070
I did. Thanks.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.191
I got to do a lot of thinking.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.515
Oh, yeah?

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.194
-So, what did you think about?
-That if I'm coming back...

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.958
...there's gonna be some changes.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.959
More jumps, more flips
and a lot less flailing.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.829
Well, see if you can make it through a
routine without walking off the ice first.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.393
No fighting.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.359
We don't have time.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.596
And I agree with Alex.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.757
If we're going to do this,
let's do it right.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.349
Okay, fine.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.315
Oh, and one other thing:

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.390
-We're only doing triples.
-Excuse me? No.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:22.079
No. Definitely no. Nobody does
side-by-side triples in competition.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:24.555
-It's too risky. It's just not done.
-Yeah, I know.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:29.788
And that's exactly why
we're gonna do it. Right, Jackie?

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.119
You agreed to this?

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.518
Yeah. Sort of.
It was a long flight.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.709
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:31.195
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. Just thinking.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.996
Nothing in particular.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.715
I'm sorry.
This must be very hard for you.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:43.354
-What are you talking about?
-We never would've let you...

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.357
-...go after him if--
-I said I was fine.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.596
There's nothing to be sorry about.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:54.469
Besides, we're gonna win.
And that's all that matters now, right?

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.352
I love you, Daddy.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.878
I love you too.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:05.912
Unbelievable.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.238
What an amazing performance.

01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:16.470
Dorsey and Harrison have set
the bar so high...

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.716
...I doubt any other team's gonna
be able top it.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:22.390
In fact, they're easily gonna walk in
to tomorrow's finals in first place.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:27.435
It's gonna tak e a major upset for them
not to mak e the U.S. Olympic Team.

01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:59.109
-Way to go, Roller Boy.
-All right, keep trying.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.039
Looks like you two are the ones
to beat. Who knew?

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:07.394
-Anyone who read the scoreboard.
-Figure-skating trash talk, I like it.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.272
Sounds like everyone's
gunning for us.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:12.472
Yeah, they are.
And it's about damn time.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.433
-You'd think you'd love it.
-It's yours to lose, man.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:16.948
It's yours to lose.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.674
I do love it. I'm just used
to being the gunner, that's all.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.996
Hey, it's
Mr. and Mrs. Number One.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.397
Wait. That didn't sound right.
Anyway, congratulations.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.199
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.072
Can I buy you guys a drink?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.468
No, thanks. After we've soaked up
all the accolades...

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.752
...and been sufficiently intimidating,
I think we should get some sleep.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:38.918
You go.
I'm way too keyed up to sleep.

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:40.468
I'll be good.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.633
All right?

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.993
Hey, couple shooters down here.
Nationals.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.997
Bring the bottle too, please.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.749
All right, everyone, to nationals, huh?
Drink up. Bottoms up.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.235
So cold but so nice.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.279
There you are. What's going on?

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.516
You should've left for the rink
a half-hour ago.

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.870
I came by to make sure he was up.
I found him all--

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.389
He looks horrible.
I don't know what we're going to do.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.989
You are going to the rink
and warm up. I will handle Alex.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.111
-Dad, you are crazy if you think--
-Just go.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.151
We'll be fine.
We'll be right behind you.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.475
Go.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.318
Can you believe it?

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.638
-Dude, I don't think I'm gonna make it.
-Is your leg broken?

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.911
No, I just feel like crap, all right?

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.591
I once skated in a playoff game
with two broken ribs.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.119
Swell.

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.232
When you die,
I'll be sure to have your balls bronzed.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.435
Man, it's really too bad, Alex,
you know?

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.835
Because you were so close.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.395
But kind of the story of your life,
isn't it?

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.598
Know what you are? You're one
of those guys that go through life...

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.518
...bragging about
what you're gonna do.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.190
And you take off running the minute
you think you're actually gonna get it.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.711
Believe whatever you wanna believe.
I can't help it if I got the flu.

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.831
There's nothing wrong with you
that a shower...

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.315
...and some aspirin
won't take care of.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.475
Come on.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.238
-What are you--?
-Let's go.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.193
In you go.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:25.199
It's cold.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.635
-Turn it off.
-All right, all right.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.879
God, get off.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.318
What if we lose?

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.720
If you don't at least try, Alex,
you're already a loser. So you tell me.

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.953
To win,
you have to be willing to fail.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.513
And the couple from Lak e Placid...

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.676
... will surely find a place
in the top five...

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.871
...here at the U.S. Figure Skating
Championships.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.799
Jackie, they're on their way.
They should be here any second.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.437
Why do I feel like
I spend my whole life waiting for him?

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.194
Wow, how true is that statement?

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.552
What?

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:27.591
-Nothing. Now's not the right time.
-It's all right.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.397
I know what you're gonna say.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:33.755
He's engaged to another woman.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.110
It's just that sometimes
I think you forget.

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:39.670
I just don't wanna see you
get your heart broken.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.029
Jackie.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.798
Well, you gotta look the other way...

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.116
...because it's already
busted wide open.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.796
-Well, you look like you feel better.
-Yeah. Your dad knew just what to do.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.273
Let's go warm up.

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.792
You know what this means?

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.919
Yeah...

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.679
...I know.

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.999
Thanks for saving me a seat.
This place is a madhouse.

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.714
And I see that you've ordered.
And have eaten half of it.

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.190
Morning. Isn't this just
the most adorable place...

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.231
...you've ever been in
in your entire life?

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.513
Yeah, as far as Olympic villages go,
it's pretty adorable.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.391
Did you wanna sit down?

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.829
-I didn't know you were coming.
-How could I miss this?

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.918
Well, you managed
to miss nationals.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.718
The Alps apparently
have a better draw than St. Louis.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:35.319
And the shopping's better.

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.715
-Can I tell her?
-Heidi....

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.348
Tell her what?

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.795
Alex and I are getting married
right after closing ceremonies.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.153
We thought that way we'd definitely
have something to celebrate.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.358
Congratulations.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.033
That's great.

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.035
-So you gonna do it here in Torino?
-That's the idea.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.753
We were out walking this morning.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:02.678
We came across
the most adorable church...

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:06.395
...right off the main " piatziola,"
square, whatever they call it.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:07.828
Piazza.

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.038
How long
have you been planning this?

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.556
Not that long, just-- I mean....

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.189
Well, we've been talking about it
for weeks and weeks.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.312
I'm actually kind of shocked Alex
was able to keep it to himself.

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.473
Alex loves his secrets.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:27.957
So after the wedding you're moving
to Connecticut, I assume?

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.388
Don't you tell her anything?

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.477
Really, there's more?
Please do tell me...

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.875
...because I am sitting
on the edge of my seat.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.559
I....

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:40.793
God, why did you have to bring
this up right now?

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.234
I'm gonna hang up my skates
after this.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.150
-You're quitting.
-No. Retiring.

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.117
Come on, it shouldn't come
as too big of a surprise. I mean...

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.719
...this was the plan, right?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.230
Win or lose, we did it. We're here.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:07.553
So, what, we do another season,
some ice shows?

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:10.399
-Come on, then what, you know?
-I don't know.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:14.711
I guess I really hadn't thought
too much past next week.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.678
Mi scusi, your taxi is here.

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.632
I'm going to Milan for a few days.

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:28.628
I looked around and white dresses
are kind of in short supply.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.749
Don't worry,
I'll be back for the finals.

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.077
I'm not worried.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:37.037
I'll help you get your stuff.

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.115
Now, technically,
they've made no mistakes so far.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.880
But surprisingly, the performance
by this American duo...

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.958
...has been passionless
and very uninspired.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:28.319
-What the hell is your problem?
-I don't have a problem.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.311
They're probably fourth
or fifth right now.

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.192
They'll really have
to put it together...

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.516
...if they want any shot
at medalling here today.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:47.153
Jackie.

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.669
-Jackie.
-No, not now.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:50.518
Hey. Hey, don't walk away from me...

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.631
...when I'm talking to you. Hey.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:58.396
-What?
-Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.318
But you gotta get over it.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.875
That's easy for you to say.
You're not being abandoned.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.792
Abandoning you?

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.912
Jackie, we're at the freaking Olympics,
your dream.

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.190
What the hell else do you want
from me?

01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.193
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.988
I want absolutely nothing.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:27.393
Hey.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:29.435
Hey.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.231
Hey. I thought you'd be up.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:36.954
-Able to get any sleep?
-On and off.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.479
Okay, more off than on.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.756
I guess I'm just a little anxious.

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.635
-And puffy.
-Jackie, what are you doing?

01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:50.398
I'm trying to figure a way to stop...

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.875
...a billion people discussing
the bags under my eyes.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.310
You've worked your whole life
to be here.

01:21:55.680 --> 01:22:00.310
-You sacrificed everything.
-It was my choice.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.715
Yes, I know. I know.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.589
And I couldn't have stopped you
even if I wanted to.

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:09.270
Then I saw you skate yesterday.

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.071
-You weren't even trying.
-I was trying. Alex was messing up--

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.310
Are you willing to give up
on your dream...

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.829
...because things aren't working out
with Alex...

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:21.678
...the way you want them
to work out?

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:24.269
You could win this,
if you still want it.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:30.394
-I don't know what I want.
-I think you do.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.717
And for the life of me, I can't figure out
why you're just sitting here.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:37.238
Talk to him, for crying out loud.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.834
What? No.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.917
What is that going to do?
He knows how I feel.

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.554
How does he know, Jackie?
Have you told him?

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.513
Have you said, "Alex, I think
you're making a horrible mistake"?

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:49.915
Have you told him
that you love him?

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.840
But what if I tell him
and he still doesn't want me?

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.875
Well, then you sit here
and watch the sunrise.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.036
Your old man will bring coffee
and croissants.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:06.869
-It's not that simple.
-You're the one making it difficult.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.430
If it was meant to be,
it wouldn't be this hard.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.436
It would've already happened.

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.795
Maybe you're right.
I don't know.

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.878
But what is it you're always saying?

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.837
" It isn't worth winning
if you don't have to fight for it"?

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.911
Alex, it's me.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.352
I know you're in there.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:14.153
I probably wouldn't let me in either
after yesterday.

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:22.755
Look, I know I'm gonna see you
in less than an hour...

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.236
...but I know that it might be
the last time, so....

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.995
I think that l--
I should tell you some things.

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.717
Just one thing, really.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:48.438
The only thing
that matters anymore...

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.192
...to me, at least....

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:56.110
Alex, from the very first....

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.839
God, you are so....

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.952
Alex, I love you.

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.958
I love you.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:23.316
There, that's-- You know,
that's what I wanted to say, okay?

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.831
Could you maybe
open the door, please...

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.429
...because I don't really wanna be
out here like this.

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.672
Alex?

01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.237
Hey, was somebody at the door?

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.078
Just the maid.

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.152
She wanted to make up the bed...

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.874
...but I told her
we weren't done using it yet.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.909
It's only 7:00,
why would the maid...?

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:09.593
-Oh, God, Heidi.
-Alex.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.114
Don't go after her.

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:29.713
Jackie.

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:43.069
I couldn't find her.
Did she say anything?

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.440
Probably nothing
you don't already know.

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.794
I think I'm gonna go.

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.593
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.598
Look, I'm sorry.

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.153
Yeah, so am I.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.278
You know it's never gonna work.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.318
I think you're wrong.

01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:17.277
I won't be here this time
if you come back.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.194
I know.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.199
Hey!

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.759
-Still?
-No, I haven't seen her.

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:01.077
I haven't talked to her. Kate's in there
with her, and she won't come out.

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.590
And I tried storming the castle,
but Schomo and Bobo over here...

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.315
-He's okay. I got him.
-...tossed me out on my sequined ass.

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:12.991
--for Jacqueline Dorsey
and Alex Harrison.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.679
Stay focused.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.192
We're up, let's go.

01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:20.271
Jackie, please talk to me.
What is going on?

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:23.199
I think I've told you everything
that I needed to say.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.869
You have 15 seconds
to take the ice.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.711
Let's get through this,
then we'll never have...

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.478
...to see each other ever again.

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.678
Is that what you want?

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.231
Yes, that's what I want.

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:41.716
Fine, have it your way.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.956
There's only one problem.

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.754
Oh, yeah? What's that?

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:52.473
I'm in love with you, Jackie.

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.753
I love you and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:14.113
-Do a split twist.
-What?

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.799
Trust me.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.033
-What was that?
-I don't know.

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.634
That is unbelievable.

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.673
A split triple twist
with a simultaneous triple toe.

01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:35.031
That's gonna go down
in Olympic history. Unbelievable.

01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.879
Beers on me. Beers on me.

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.478
Yes.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.675
The answer to everything is yes.

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.073
Yes.
