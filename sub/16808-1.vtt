00:48.955 --> 00:53.442
11:55... almost midnight.

00:53.961 --> 00:56.753
Enough time for one more story,

00:57.931 --> 01:01.466
one more story before twelve.

01:02.469 --> 01:05.160
Just to keep us warm.

01:07.107 --> 01:12.072
In five minutes,
it will be the 21st of April.

01:12.946 --> 01:18.234
One hundred years ago,
on the 21st of April,

01:18.269 --> 01:22.087
out on the waters
around Spivey Point,

01:22.555 --> 01:26.293
a small clipper ship
drew toward land.

01:26.960 --> 01:32.064
Suddenly, out of the night,
the fog rolled in.

01:32.132 --> 01:34.567
<i>For a moment,
they could see nothing,</i>

01:34.654 --> 01:36.870
<i>not a foot ahead of them.</i>

01:37.338 --> 01:40.606
Then they saw a light.

01:41.074 --> 01:46.112
By God, it was a fire
burning on the shore,

01:46.880 --> 01:50.883
strong enough to penetrate
the swirling mist.

01:51.251 --> 01:55.455
<i>They steered a course
toward the light,</i>

01:55.523 --> 01:59.892
<i>but it was a campfire
like this one.</i>

02:00.960 --> 02:04.052
The ship crashed
against the rocks.

02:04.598 --> 02:06.544
The hull sheared in two.

02:06.634 --> 02:08.969
The mast snapped like a twig,

02:09.637 --> 02:14.107
and the wreckage sank
with all the men aboard.

02:16.443 --> 02:18.144
<i>At the bottom of the sea</i>

02:18.212 --> 02:21.881
<i>lay the Elizabeth Dane
with her crew,</i>

02:22.149 --> 02:25.385
<i>their lungs filled
with salt water,</i>

02:25.653 --> 02:30.056
<i>their eyes open and staring
into the darkness.</i>

02:30.524 --> 02:34.060
<i>And above,
as suddenly as it had come,</i>

02:34.128 --> 02:38.431
<i>the fog lifted, receded
back across the ocean,</i>

02:38.799 --> 02:41.034
<i>and never came again.</i>

02:42.002 --> 02:45.237
But it is told by the fishermen

02:45.305 --> 02:48.240
and their fathers
and grandfathers

02:48.308 --> 02:52.545
that when the fog
returns to Antonio Bay,

02:52.713 --> 02:55.882
the men at the bottom of the sea,

02:56.250 --> 02:59.285
out in the water by Spivey Point,

02:59.753 --> 03:05.091
will rise up and search
for the campfire

03:05.158 --> 03:09.831
<i>that led them to their
dark and icy death.</i>

03:14.034 --> 03:15.668
Twelve o' clock,

03:16.436 --> 03:19.805
the 21st of April.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.797
<i>It's twelve midnight,</i>

04:15.798 --> 04:18.197
<i>and we just started
the little witching hour.</i>

04:18.265 --> 04:21.833
<i>This is Stevie Wayne,
on top of the world tonight.</i>

04:21.901 --> 04:25.204
<i>And I'll be here right
up until about 1:00.</i>

04:52.181 --> 04:53.452
<i>I'm all through, father.</i>

04:54.853 --> 04:56.553
Oh, thank you, Bennett.

04:57.020 --> 05:01.924
Uh... I won't need you until
4:00 tomorrow, Bennett.

05:01.992 --> 05:03.058
Yes, sir.

05:04.726 --> 05:07.589
Would you like something to
keep you warm on the way home?

05:07.598 --> 05:10.432
No, thank you.
Father, can I get paid?

05:12.935 --> 05:15.537
Why don't you come in at,
uh, 6:00

05:15.605 --> 05:17.476
instead of 4:00 tomorrow?

05:19.977 --> 05:21.077
Yes, sir.

05:31.771 --> 05:35.507
Uh, Bennett?
Eh, Bennett?

05:37.444 --> 05:40.145
Bennett?

05:42.949 --> 05:44.015
Hello?

06:00.232 --> 06:01.266
Uh...

06:48.414 --> 06:50.382
<i>It's 59 degrees outside.</i>

06:50.449 --> 06:54.170
<i>And let me be the first to wish
Antonio Bay a Happy Birthday.</i>

06:54.737 --> 06:56.639
<i>We're one hundred years old today.</i>

06:58.007 --> 07:00.309
<i>The weatherman's been
trying to spoil it for us.</i>

07:00.377 --> 07:02.644
<i>He says we may be in
for some rain tonight.</i>

07:02.712 --> 07:06.182
<i>But from where I'm sitting,
it looks like clear skies.</i>

07:06.450 --> 07:09.118
<i>I think the weatherman's
been working too hard.</i>

07:09.786 --> 07:11.822
<i>Well, I'll stay here
for another hour...</i>

07:11.823 --> 07:13.523
<i>just to see if he's right.</i>

07:13.890 --> 07:16.392
<i>And I'm inviting you
to stay here with me.</i>

07:17.760 --> 07:19.163
<i>Uh, there's a cutter run</i>

07:19.164 --> 07:21.664
<i>aground over here on
the east bay, over.</i>

07:22.431 --> 07:25.100
Global 1x5.

07:25.168 --> 07:26.669
<i>It's the Lady Belle Pacific,</i>

07:26.737 --> 07:30.739
<i>serial number 024KL596.
Over.</i>

07:31.407 --> 07:34.694
<i>Global 1x5, the Lady Belle
Pacific is sea worthy,</i>

07:34.695 --> 07:35.795
<i>no major damage.</i>

07:35.862 --> 07:37.695
<i>Why don't you send
a tow on over here,</i>

07:37.763 --> 07:40.232
<i>about a quarter mile
above the boatel. Over.</i>

11:38.587 --> 11:41.957
<i>This is K-A-B,
Antonio Bay, California.</i>

11:43.724 --> 11:45.627
<i>Six minutes after midnight.</i>

11:46.194 --> 11:47.799
<i>Haven't heard from
the weatherman yet,</i>

11:47.800 --> 11:50.000
<i>so I can't say for sure
about that rain,</i>

11:50.666 --> 11:53.886
<i>but there's a full moon
and no clouds in the sky.</i>

11:56.155 --> 11:57.292
<i>I'm Stevie Wayne.</i>

11:57.493 --> 11:59.893
<i>And if you don't have
anything to do right now,</i>

11:59.960 --> 12:03.429
<i>I'll be here playing music all
through the witching hour.</i>

12:07.934 --> 12:09.987
<i>Even if you do have
something to do,</i>

12:10.188 --> 12:11.888
<i>keep me turned on for a while,</i>

12:12.255 --> 12:14.823
<i>and I'll try my best
to do the same for you.</i>

12:14.991 --> 12:16.324
OK!

12:36.911 --> 12:37.779
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:37.847 --> 12:39.881
- How far you going?
- Other side of town.

12:39.950 --> 12:41.584
That's close enough.

12:43.653 --> 12:45.855
- Make it?
- Yeah. Thank you.

12:57.199 --> 12:59.734
- Sip?
- Thanks.

13:06.942 --> 13:08.677
Listen,
I never hitchhiked before.

13:09.944 --> 13:11.548
I just really want to be careful.

13:11.549 --> 13:13.049
Can I ask you something?

13:13.115 --> 13:15.584
- Sure.
- Are you weird?

13:17.052 --> 13:18.055
Yes, I am.

13:19.356 --> 13:20.556
Yes, I am weird.

13:20.622 --> 13:21.556
- You are weird. You're weird.
- Yes.

13:21.623 --> 13:23.091
Thank God you're weird.

13:23.258 --> 13:26.061
The last one I had was so normal,
it was disgusting.

13:26.328 --> 13:27.696
He picked me up in Santa Barbara.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.798
By the time we got to Carmel
he wanted to marry me.

13:29.865 --> 13:32.701
Oh, yeah. I thought you
never hitchhiked before.

13:37.038 --> 13:38.639
Not before last week.

13:39.008 --> 13:40.244
You're my...

13:41.945 --> 13:43.045
thirteenth ride.

13:43.313 --> 13:46.014
Oh, great. Weird and unlucky.

13:46.181 --> 13:47.951
Heh.
We'll see.

13:51.654 --> 13:53.121
Look out!
Ohh!

14:00.362 --> 14:01.296
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

14:01.363 --> 14:02.864
- You're sure?
- I'm fine. I think so.

14:03.532 --> 14:04.966
What the hell was...

14:11.840 --> 14:14.044
<i>It's exactly twelve
minutes after midnight,</i>

14:14.445 --> 14:15.845
<i>and this is Stevie Wayne...</i>

14:16.112 --> 14:17.214
Let's get out of here.

14:19.482 --> 14:22.684
<i>I'm high tonight in the K-A-B
lighthouse on Spivey Point.</i>

14:22.752 --> 14:25.353
<i>And in case you've forgotten,
it's April 21st.</i>

14:25.521 --> 14:27.822
<i>And a Happy Birthday
for Antonio Bay.</i>

14:28.390 --> 14:30.725
Now, there's a celebration
planned for tonight.

14:31.193 --> 14:33.662
So if you're so excited
about it you can't sleep,

14:34.530 --> 14:36.731
well, stay up with me,

14:36.799 --> 14:40.636
and I'll figure out some
way to keep you occupied.

14:42.503 --> 14:43.571
Or not.

14:49.044 --> 14:50.245
K-A-B.

14:50.312 --> 14:51.247
<i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>

14:51.248 --> 14:52.948
Hi, Dan.
What have you got?

14:53.215 --> 14:54.749
Well, I'm just calling
to see if you're lonely,

14:54.817 --> 14:56.297
if there's anything
I can do about it.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.653
<i>Never lonely, Dan.</i>

14:58.120 --> 14:59.389
<i>I thought you were
off work at 8:00.</i>

14:59.390 --> 15:02.190
I changed shifts so I can make
it to the big party tonight.

15:02.257 --> 15:03.291
Will you be there?

15:04.258 --> 15:06.652
Well... until I can
talk someone else

15:06.662 --> 15:09.598
into giving up city life
for Antonio Bay, I'm it.

15:09.965 --> 15:11.300
And "it" means day and night.

15:11.501 --> 15:12.801
<i>Too much work.</i>

15:12.868 --> 15:14.702
Well, that's what I get
for owning a station.

15:14.770 --> 15:17.130
And if you don't tell me why you
called in about 15 seconds,

15:17.173 --> 15:18.341
I'm gonna have to hang up on you.

15:18.342 --> 15:19.663
You want something to talk about?

15:19.709 --> 15:20.742
<i>Anything.</i>

15:20.810 --> 15:23.079
I've got a position on
a trawler about, ooh...

15:23.147 --> 15:26.383
<i>15 Miles out,
called The Sea Grass.</i>

15:26.984 --> 15:28.784
And I've got something
on my scope...

15:28.851 --> 15:30.653
appears to be a fog bank.

15:30.654 --> 15:32.154
Oh, it's about 25 Miles out,

15:32.521 --> 15:33.561
moving in their direction.

15:34.957 --> 15:35.924
Thanks, Dan.

15:35.959 --> 15:37.494
That's worth about 10 seconds.

15:37.795 --> 15:39.495
<i>I'm on the air. Bye.</i>

15:44.600 --> 15:48.570
Ahoy, maties.
This is K-A-B, Antonio Bay.

15:49.238 --> 15:52.524
Stevie Wayne here beaming
a signal across the sea.

15:53.092 --> 15:54.445
<i>To the men of The Sea Grass,</i>

15:54.746 --> 15:57.646
<i>15 Miles out tonight,
a warm hello,</i>

15:57.813 --> 16:00.350
<i>and keep a watch out
for that fog bank</i>

16:00.351 --> 16:01.851
<i>heading in from the east.</i>

16:02.417 --> 16:06.220
<i>In the meantime, relax with
me while I play this song</i>

16:06.288 --> 16:09.924
<i>from the Coupe de Villes...
dedicated just to you.</i>

16:09.992 --> 16:11.926
Boy, would I like to meet her.

16:11.994 --> 16:13.995
Heh. I saw her at a
grocery store one day.

16:14.163 --> 16:14.696
And?

16:14.764 --> 16:16.831
- You would like to meet her.
- She's crazy.

16:16.899 --> 16:19.001
There's no fog bank out there.

16:19.302 --> 16:20.702
<i>What do you know about her?</i>

16:20.769 --> 16:22.771
<i>She owns that lighthouse.
I know that.</i>

16:22.838 --> 16:24.473
Her son plays little league
with my kid brother.

16:24.540 --> 16:25.607
She's a mother?

16:25.975 --> 16:27.676
Ha ha. I thought you
were happily married.

16:27.743 --> 16:31.580
- Huh. Not that happy.
- There's no fog bank out there.

16:37.652 --> 16:41.522
Hey.
There's a fog bank out there.

16:43.592 --> 16:46.394
All right.
I'm drunk enough.

16:46.661 --> 16:47.931
Let's go back.

16:48.832 --> 16:50.232
All right, all right.

16:54.736 --> 16:56.239
Al, come here.

16:57.240 --> 16:58.940
- Just give him a hand.
- Come here.

17:11.621 --> 17:12.954
What was that?

17:42.052 --> 17:43.152
Come here.

17:46.288 --> 17:47.756
What was that?

17:55.797 --> 17:58.433
It's the generator.

17:59.601 --> 18:01.269
Wha... wha... wha...

18:05.841 --> 18:06.941
Al.

18:23.758 --> 18:24.693
It's gone.

18:24.761 --> 18:26.795
Hey, there was just
a ship out there.

18:26.962 --> 18:28.432
Al, listen.

18:29.833 --> 18:30.733
Nothing.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.968
- Listen.
- Who's there?

18:44.846 --> 18:46.381
Who is that?

19:01.997 --> 19:02.897
Unh!

19:02.965 --> 19:06.000
Al!
Aah!

19:09.304 --> 19:10.171
Arrrrgh!

19:11.540 --> 19:13.274
Aaah!

19:34.930 --> 19:36.564
Al, it's right beside us.

19:39.801 --> 19:42.937
It's big, Al.
It's a ship.

19:43.805 --> 19:45.440
It's a big ship!

19:48.477 --> 19:50.745
What happened?
Did you get wet?

20:09.999 --> 20:12.033
It's 12:43...

20:12.801 --> 20:17.338
and I've got four in a row for
you right here on K-A-B.

20:54.709 --> 20:56.644
Nothing but water, Stevie.

20:59.347 --> 21:01.483
But it sure beats Chicago.

21:07.121 --> 21:08.057
K-A-B.

21:08.560 --> 21:09.769
I like what you said

21:09.804 --> 21:12.218
but for your information,
you lied.

21:12.294 --> 21:14.629
The fog bank has moved due west

21:14.696 --> 21:17.032
<i>and probably missed
the ship entirely.</i>

21:18.499 --> 21:20.303
Well, my gauges must be wrong.

21:20.304 --> 21:22.004
I've got a wind
blowing due east.

21:22.071 --> 21:24.572
Now, what kind of a fog
blows against the wind?

21:24.640 --> 21:25.808
<i>You got me.</i>

21:25.809 --> 21:27.209
I'm not so sure I want you.

21:27.276 --> 21:29.245
You're just a voice on the phone.

21:29.246 --> 21:32.746
<i>And you're just a voice on the
radio. We'd make a perfect couple.</i>

21:34.413 --> 21:36.883
<i>You let me take you to dinner
tonight, I'll prove it to you.</i>

21:37.850 --> 21:39.053
Sorry, Dan.

21:39.120 --> 21:42.557
My idea of perfection
is a voice on the phone.

21:42.924 --> 21:44.526
<i>OK, mystery lady.</i>

21:45.227 --> 21:46.427
Good night.

21:46.594 --> 21:47.195
<i>Good night.</i>

22:08.516 --> 22:10.918
Not bad.

22:11.685 --> 22:13.554
I started a week ago
in San Diego,

22:14.222 --> 22:16.557
right up the coast,
5 drawings a day.

22:17.825 --> 22:19.296
It'll probably take me a
month to get to Vancouver,

22:19.361 --> 22:21.763
and if I can sell 'em for 5
bucks apiece, I'll be rich.

22:21.831 --> 22:23.897
Yeah.

22:26.101 --> 22:28.102
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

22:28.170 --> 22:31.172
- What's your name?
- Elizabeth.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.774
- Nick.
- Hello, Nick.

22:34.742 --> 22:36.244
Hi.

22:37.611 --> 22:39.413
Is that where you're from,
San Diego?

22:39.581 --> 22:41.882
Wait a minute. You said,
"can I ask you something?"

22:42.050 --> 22:45.619
Well, something to me means one
thing. San Diego is two things.

22:45.687 --> 22:46.654
OK.

22:49.190 --> 22:52.093
Pasadena, and a lot of money.

22:53.761 --> 22:56.029
Never a chance to do
anything I wanna do.

22:56.097 --> 22:57.197
Aww.

22:57.266 --> 22:58.867
Aww.

23:00.834 --> 23:02.470
What do you want to do?

23:03.237 --> 23:04.376
I don't know.

23:06.277 --> 23:07.777
That's OK.
Me neither.

23:09.443 --> 23:11.880
I think I got to have this one.
Can I buy it?

23:11.947 --> 23:15.250
Uh-uh.
The drawing's free.

24:13.007 --> 24:14.610
It's 1:00, straight up,

24:15.211 --> 24:16.611
<i>the end of the witching hour</i>

24:16.678 --> 24:18.813
<i>and time for me to sign off.</i>

24:25.253 --> 24:27.457
<i>So until tomorrow night,
at six P.M.,</i>

24:27.458 --> 24:29.941
<i>when K-A-B comes back on the air,</i>

24:30.124 --> 24:32.560
<i>this is Stevie Wayne,
your night light,</i>

24:32.627 --> 24:35.230
<i>hoping you have a
nice rest of the night.</i>

26:33.815 --> 26:36.817
Hey, mom!
Hey, mom!

26:39.354 --> 26:40.453
<i>Mom!</i>

26:40.821 --> 26:43.491
Mom, come on. Get up.
Look what I found.

26:44.158 --> 26:47.495
Andy...
I love you,

26:48.863 --> 26:50.531
but sometimes you're a real pain.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.859
Sure, mom, but look it.
First, it was a gold coin,

26:53.935 --> 26:56.490
and then it turned into
this neat piece of wood.

26:57.005 --> 27:00.307
- This is one of those times.
- Uh-huh, but look at it, mom.

27:04.578 --> 27:07.848
Good morning, Andrew. Did you
have a nice time last night?

27:07.916 --> 27:10.852
Yeah. Old Mr. Machen
told us ghost stories.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.322
Did you thank Mrs. Kobritz
for bringing you home?

27:14.389 --> 27:17.858
Yes, ma'am. Mom, can I have a
stomach pounder and a coke?

27:18.926 --> 27:20.994
- After lunch.
- OK.

27:21.162 --> 27:22.630
I'm gonna go
look for another one.

27:22.697 --> 27:24.965
Maybe this time I can
get the gold coin.

27:50.391 --> 27:51.427
<i>Where the hell is he?</i>

27:52.028 --> 27:54.114
Rolled out of here
at 4:15 yesterday.

27:54.195 --> 27:56.196
- That's the last I saw of him.
- Al said 7:30, right here.

27:56.265 --> 27:58.265
Well, you know Al.
If I were you, I'd give myself...

27:58.300 --> 28:00.169
<i>Did you call the
coast guard, Hank?</i>

28:00.170 --> 28:01.771
Nick, they probably
got drunk last night.

28:01.794 --> 28:04.171
- They're still out there...
<i>- No, he wouldn't do that.</i>

28:04.238 --> 28:05.338
He'd do anything.

28:05.406 --> 28:07.508
<i>Al and I got drunk so many times
together, I can't count 'em all,</i>

28:07.576 --> 28:10.378
<i>but we never got so shitfaced
we couldn't make it back in.</i>

28:11.046 --> 28:13.747
<i>He's too good a sailor to stay out there
all night and not let somebody know.</i>

28:13.915 --> 28:16.850
- You sound like his wife.
<i>- Just his friend.</i>

28:17.118 --> 28:19.420
- You worry too much, Nick.
- Yeah.

28:21.523 --> 28:25.116
- Where are we going?
- I'm going to talk Ashcroft

28:25.159 --> 28:27.728
into taking out his boat and
looking for the Sea Grass.

28:27.796 --> 28:31.132
- Who's Ashcroft?
- Someone who owes me a favor.

28:31.300 --> 28:32.934
Can I come along?

28:33.702 --> 28:35.836
I thought you had to
move on to Vancouver?

28:35.904 --> 28:38.606
- Eventually.
- Yeah.

28:44.579 --> 28:46.348
<i>The sheriff will
drive his own car.</i>

28:46.549 --> 28:47.241
The mayor and his wife

28:47.291 --> 28:50.984
<i>are to be picked up at 6:45 and
brought to the mayor's box.</i>

28:51.452 --> 28:55.556
<i>Then we'll have speeches by</i>
the mayor, the sheriff, and me.

28:56.224 --> 28:57.892
- Oh, do you have my notes?
- Yes, ma'am.

28:57.959 --> 29:01.429
<i>Then we will pass out the candles
and begin the procession.</i>

29:01.696 --> 29:04.000
<i>Then I will go home
and pass out.</i>

29:05.201 --> 29:06.901
<i>I'm almost afraid to look.</i>

29:07.368 --> 29:08.568
<i>Well...</i>

29:08.637 --> 29:11.471
<i>Testing, testing.</i>

29:11.539 --> 29:14.542
- Not bad. Not bad at all.
- A work of art.

29:14.909 --> 29:18.112
Sandy, just be civil to
me for another five hours.

29:18.279 --> 29:19.536
That's all I ask.

29:20.062 --> 29:22.374
<i>Let's see now. Oh, the candles.</i>

29:22.416 --> 29:24.351
Did you order the candles?
What a thought, a candlelight

29:24.418 --> 29:26.954
- procession with no candles.
- All taken care of.

29:27.622 --> 29:28.757
And the promotional material...

29:28.824 --> 29:31.792
- Did you get that over to Stevie?
- Signed, sealed, and delivered.

29:32.260 --> 29:34.795
Sandy, you can be a very
annoying person at times,

29:34.798 --> 29:38.100
- but you do keep me together.
- Thank you, Mrs. Williams.

30:07.428 --> 30:11.199
Spivey Point.
As of 1:57 today,

30:11.766 --> 30:15.169
<i>The Sea Grass had not responded
to radio communication.</i>

30:15.636 --> 30:18.872
<i>The coast guard has begun a
sweep South from Watley,</i>

30:18.940 --> 30:22.943
<i>around Arcom Reef, and should
be in the area of Spivey Point</i>

30:23.111 --> 30:25.146
<i>in approximately one hour.</i>

30:25.814 --> 30:28.283
<i>Repeating this bulletin
from the coast guard,</i>

30:28.750 --> 30:32.520
<i>be on the look out for the
Sea Grass, a 30-foot trawler,</i>

30:32.687 --> 30:36.690
<i>last seen approximately 15
Miles east of Spivey Point.</i>

30:37.458 --> 30:41.762
<i>If you sight this vessel, please
notify the coast guard immediately.</i>

30:53.341 --> 30:56.244
- Nick, can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

30:57.011 --> 31:00.048
- Is it always like this?
- It's always different.

31:01.716 --> 31:04.418
- You're worried, aren't you?
- Yeah.

31:04.986 --> 31:06.454
She can get real mean.

31:07.122 --> 31:08.089
<i>There.</i>

31:12.026 --> 31:13.326
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

31:15.930 --> 31:16.864
Oh, yeah.

31:19.733 --> 31:22.369
<i>Well, if I can just get through
the speeches without yawning.</i>

31:22.437 --> 31:24.705
<i>- I couldn't sleep last night.
- Too excited?</i>

31:24.773 --> 31:27.641
No. Al went out on his boat last
night and didn't come home.

31:27.708 --> 31:30.088
<i>- He still isn't back.</i>
- Mrs. Williams!

31:30.111 --> 31:31.481
<i>I called the coast guard,
and they said,</i>

31:31.482 --> 31:33.582
<i>"oh, he might have
had engine trouble."</i>

31:33.648 --> 31:34.623
They said not to worry.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.620
He was complaining
about his boat last week.

31:37.655 --> 31:38.789
<i>Maybe you ought to go home.</i>

31:39.390 --> 31:41.672
That's the last place
I want to go.

31:41.781 --> 31:43.559
<i>My dog started to bark
at 12:00 last night</i>

31:43.660 --> 31:45.660
<i>and didn't stop until
6:00 this morning.</i>

31:45.727 --> 31:46.560
What happened?

31:46.728 --> 31:48.929
He was pointed toward
the ocean and growling.

31:48.997 --> 31:50.242
What does that tell you?

31:50.467 --> 31:53.114
My dog goes crazy and
decides to bark at the water.

31:53.249 --> 31:56.203
I heard the church bells at midnight
as I started to drift off to sleep,

31:56.271 --> 31:59.273
and suddenly, my car alarm went
off for absolutely no reason.

31:59.341 --> 32:00.374
<i>- Really?</i>
- Uh-huh.

32:00.542 --> 32:03.820
Woke up the whole block.
This town sits around for 100 years

32:03.845 --> 32:06.847
and nothing happens, and then one
night, the whole place falls apart.

32:07.415 --> 32:08.216
<i>Al?</i>

32:09.584 --> 32:11.185
Take this line, too.

32:12.153 --> 32:13.186
<i>Al!</i>

32:13.254 --> 32:15.489
<i>Tommy!
Dick!</i>

32:20.595 --> 32:22.696
<i>Cabin and steering
house are empty.</i>

32:22.964 --> 32:25.234
Maybe somebody picked them up.

32:27.102 --> 32:30.771
- There's water in the generator.
- But the deck is as dry as a bone.

32:57.265 --> 33:00.500
There you have it.
My next project: Restoration

33:00.568 --> 33:03.536
<i>of the Morgantown Road Cemetery.
It's historical.</i>

33:03.604 --> 33:05.473
- Our ancestors are buried here.
- It's gonna cost a lot.

33:05.540 --> 33:08.876
Come on, Sandy. So? This town
should be proud of its past.

33:08.943 --> 33:13.046
But trying to get anyone involved in
community affairs is like pulling teeth.

33:13.314 --> 33:15.779
<i>Better get the estimates ready for
the council meeting next month.</i>

33:15.784 --> 33:16.884
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

33:17.051 --> 33:19.220
Sandy, you're the only person
I know who can make

33:19.288 --> 33:20.889
"yes, ma'am" sound like
"screw you."

33:20.990 --> 33:21.990
Yes, ma'am.

33:22.156 --> 33:25.159
Now, if we'll just say a little prayer
asking that he not be in his cups.

33:32.199 --> 33:34.154
<i>Not a good sign.</i>

33:36.904 --> 33:40.207
<i>Father Malone?
Father Malone!</i>

33:45.480 --> 33:48.649
- Hello!
- Another bad sign.

33:49.217 --> 33:51.886
You try the study,
and I'll look up front.

34:12.706 --> 34:13.873
Father Malone!

34:15.976 --> 34:19.079
- Jesus!
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Williams.

34:19.647 --> 34:21.581
- Mrs. Williams...
- Are you all right?

34:22.750 --> 34:24.818
I have something to show you.

34:30.224 --> 34:31.759
"December 9.

34:32.827 --> 34:36.063
"Met with Blake this evening
for the first time.

34:36.931 --> 34:38.130
"He stood in the shadows

34:38.199 --> 34:41.369
"to prevent me from getting
a clear look at his face.

34:42.637 --> 34:44.804
"What a vile disease this is.

34:45.973 --> 34:48.976
"He is a rich man
with a cursed condition,

34:49.943 --> 34:53.480
"but this does not prevent him from
trying to better his situation

34:53.547 --> 34:55.949
and that of his comrades
at the colony."

35:16.804 --> 35:19.041
Every single gauge is broken.

35:21.609 --> 35:23.611
- All the glass is shattered.
- Remind you of something?

35:23.778 --> 35:25.113
- Last night.
- Your truck.

35:25.180 --> 35:27.615
Yeah.
Yeah.

35:34.622 --> 35:36.123
The thermometer's broken.

35:38.125 --> 35:40.327
The Mercury's stuck at 20 degrees.

35:43.430 --> 35:44.664
There's no water got in here,

35:44.732 --> 35:46.501
but something awful cold did.

35:48.269 --> 35:51.571
"December 11.
Blake's proposition is simple.

35:52.340 --> 35:54.541
"He wants to move off
Tanzier Island

35:54.609 --> 35:58.479
"and relocate the entire
colony just north of here.

35:59.547 --> 36:01.481
"He has purchased a clipper ship

36:01.649 --> 36:04.652
"called the <i>Elizabeth Dane.</i>

36:05.420 --> 36:06.920
"With part of his fortune

36:06.988 --> 36:10.024
"and asks only for
permission to settle here.

36:10.591 --> 36:13.994
"I must balance my feelings
of mercy and compassion

36:14.062 --> 36:18.365
"toward this poor man with
my revulsion at the thought

36:18.433 --> 36:21.435
of a leper colony
only a mile distant."

36:40.087 --> 36:41.622
It's rusted to the wall.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.427
It was on.

36:55.402 --> 36:58.105
- They drank a lot of beer last night.
- Every night.

36:59.073 --> 37:00.407
What's it like?

37:01.375 --> 37:03.544
It's always the same.
Room starts spinning...

37:03.612 --> 37:04.715
I mean fishing.

37:08.583 --> 37:09.849
You fish.

37:09.917 --> 37:12.486
The only thing I know about
fishing is you use a lot of worms.

37:12.554 --> 37:13.854
Hmm.

37:15.222 --> 37:16.390
Salt water.

37:18.958 --> 37:21.528
She was clean 2 nights ago.
I checked her out myself.

37:21.596 --> 37:24.297
And now it's as if she's been
turned over in the water.

37:27.501 --> 37:30.203
"April 20.
The six of us met tonight.

37:31.271 --> 37:32.873
"From midnight until 1:00,

37:32.941 --> 37:36.676
"we planned the death
of Blake and his comrades.

37:37.244 --> 37:41.181
<i>"I tell myself that Blake's gold
will allow the church to be built</i>

37:41.449 --> 37:44.117
"and our small settlement
to become a township,

37:44.185 --> 37:47.387
"but it does not soothe
the horror that I feel

37:47.455 --> 37:50.690
being an accomplice to murder."

37:53.761 --> 37:56.496
Now what?

37:57.864 --> 37:59.599
Wait for the coast guard.

38:04.371 --> 38:07.340
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

38:07.908 --> 38:10.244
Ever since you picked me up,
things have been going wrong.

38:10.411 --> 38:12.645
The clock broke, the windows
have been breaking.

38:12.913 --> 38:15.548
- The weirdo at the door last night.
- That isn't you.

38:15.716 --> 38:17.150
I'm not so sure.

38:17.918 --> 38:21.555
Things seem to happen to me.
I'm bad luck.

38:23.623 --> 38:26.660
I don't believe in luck,
good or bad.

38:28.228 --> 38:29.863
I don't believe in anything much.

38:32.966 --> 38:34.768
Something did happen once.

38:37.938 --> 38:39.673
My father was a fisherman.

38:40.741 --> 38:43.777
He ran a trawler
out of Whitely Reef.

38:44.745 --> 38:48.481
One night, late,
he was coming back in.

38:49.149 --> 38:51.920
He was out beyond the reef,
out near Spivey Point.

38:53.587 --> 38:55.322
He looked to windward

38:55.689 --> 38:58.326
and saw a brig under shortsail

38:59.693 --> 39:01.361
heading right for him.

39:04.398 --> 39:07.234
And he radioed.
There was no reply.

39:08.301 --> 39:11.905
Nothing moved on the deck,
but she held her course.

39:14.242 --> 39:15.375
My dad and two of his hands,

39:15.543 --> 39:19.079
they boarded the brig...
the <i>Resa Jane.</i>

39:20.247 --> 39:21.916
No one was on board.

39:23.784 --> 39:27.254
<i>There was food on the table...
and a hot, steaming cup of coffee.</i>

39:27.421 --> 39:31.525
<i>But underneath, a tin cup
was rusted to the table.</i>

39:32.793 --> 39:35.362
And then something caught
my father's eye.

39:35.829 --> 39:41.168
<i>It was a gold doubloon
minted in Spain, 1867.</i>

39:42.635 --> 39:45.004
My dad picked up the coin,
put it in his breast pocket

39:45.073 --> 39:47.140
of his jacket, and zippered it up.

39:47.608 --> 39:51.378
He came home,
told us the story.

39:51.845 --> 39:54.414
And he unzippered the pocket
to give me the coin.

39:56.083 --> 39:57.084
<i>It was gone.</i>

39:59.853 --> 40:01.821
I think I'll go to
Vancouver now.

40:04.458 --> 40:06.693
Aaah!

40:08.196 --> 40:10.831
"April 21st.
The deed is done.

40:12.099 --> 40:14.434
"Blake followed
our false fire on shore,

40:14.502 --> 40:17.671
"and his ship broke apart
on the rocks off Spivey Point.

40:18.939 --> 40:20.774
"We were aided by
an unearthly fog

40:20.841 --> 40:23.510
"that rolled in
as if heaven sent,

40:23.677 --> 40:26.847
"although God had no part
in our actions tonight.

40:27.615 --> 40:29.682
"Blake's gold will be
recovered tomorrow,

40:29.750 --> 40:33.688
<i>but may the lord forgive us
for what we have done."</i>

40:35.055 --> 40:36.924
I couldn't read any further.

40:39.192 --> 40:41.729
Your grandfather
had a way with words.

40:44.832 --> 40:47.901
Our celebration tonight
is a travesty.

40:49.069 --> 40:50.804
We're honoring murderers.

41:41.488 --> 41:44.524
<i>Side one,
K-A-B promos and lead-ins.</i>

41:45.092 --> 41:49.729
<i>More music on top of

<i>Thirty-one.</i>

<i>From the top of the world,

42:24.898 --> 42:30.270
<i>The smooth sound of K-A-B,

<i>Fifty-four.</i>

42:35.743 --> 42:39.146
<i>K-A-B 1340.</i>

42:44.118 --> 42:45.485
<i>Thirty-one.</i>

42:46.553 --> 42:50.290
<i>The sounds of the
surf from Antonio Bay.</i>

42:50.658 --> 42:54.461
<i>K-A-B 1340.</i>

42:57.431 --> 42:58.665
<i>Thirty-nine.</i>

42:59.732 --> 43:04.137
<i>Fabulous 1340
K-A-B, Antonio Bay.</i>

43:08.743 --> 43:13.447
<i>More music on top

43:19.286 --> 43:23.056
<i>Est-111-B, cut two.</i>

<i>From the top of the world,</i>

43:26.961 --> 43:30.863
<i>fabulous 1340 K-A-B,
Antonio Bay.</i>

43:33.501 --> 43:36.069
Father, where did you find this?

43:37.237 --> 43:40.874
My grandfather hid
his sins in the walls.

43:41.141 --> 43:43.977
- When did you find it?
- Last night...

43:44.645 --> 43:47.614
<i>Just after midnight.
What difference does it make?</i>

43:47.782 --> 43:50.484
That's the same time the
rest of the town fell apart.

43:52.252 --> 43:53.355
Yes.

43:55.856 --> 43:56.956
And the same time

43:57.023 --> 44:01.428
the six conspirators met
one hundred years ago.

44:01.896 --> 44:03.330
It's really getting late.

44:03.397 --> 44:05.132
Uh, there's not much we can do

44:05.199 --> 44:07.066
about any of this.
Are you going

44:07.134 --> 44:09.436
to give the benediction
tonight, father?

44:10.503 --> 44:12.739
Antonio Bay has a curse on it.

44:13.607 --> 44:17.510
- Do we take that as a "no"?
<i>- Maybe it's just as well.</i>

44:20.913 --> 44:22.782
We're leaving now, father.

44:23.850 --> 44:25.484
Will you be all right?

44:28.288 --> 44:30.056
I'm going to call Dr. Thayden

44:30.123 --> 44:32.559
and ask him to just drop by.

44:33.726 --> 44:36.563
I think you're taking all
of this much too seriously.

44:36.630 --> 44:41.834
We're all cursed,
Mrs. Williams, all of us.

44:53.881 --> 44:57.918
<i>1340 K-A-B.</i>

<i>The smooth sound.</i>

45:03.878 --> 45:08.314
<i>Fabulous 1340 K-A-B.</i>

45:14.134 --> 45:15.367

<i>Forty-six.</i>

45:29.349 --> 45:31.784
<i>The smooth sound...</i>

45:33.420 --> 45:35.156
<i>Something that one lives with</i>

45:35.157 --> 45:37.357
<i>like an albatross around the neck,</i>

45:37.425 --> 45:39.559
<i>No. More like a millstone,</i>

45:39.727 --> 45:42.295
<i>a plumbing stone, by God.</i>

45:42.963 --> 45:44.631
<i>Damn them all!</i>

45:44.698 --> 45:46.165
Aah!

46:14.594 --> 46:17.096
<i>End side two, K-A-B promos.</i>

46:28.308 --> 46:31.108
How can a man drown and
not touch the water?

46:32.311 --> 46:33.880
He had water in his lungs,

46:34.647 --> 46:36.049
salt water around his mouth,

46:36.116 --> 46:37.684
seaweed in his clothes.

46:39.152 --> 46:40.219
Unless...

46:43.189 --> 46:44.891
You OK?

46:45.458 --> 46:46.927
Did you see his eyes?

46:48.395 --> 46:49.929
Yeah, I saw his eyes.

46:57.771 --> 47:00.335
Andy, the telephone.

47:00.440 --> 47:02.241
I got it, Mrs. Kobritz.

47:06.980 --> 47:07.547
Hello?

47:07.715 --> 47:09.549
Andy, where did you get
that driftwood?

47:09.917 --> 47:11.950
I told you, mom, it was on
the beach this morning.

47:12.220 --> 47:13.520
- Where?
<i>- By the rocks.</i>

47:13.788 --> 47:14.954
What was it doing?

47:15.722 --> 47:17.456
First it was a gold coin

47:17.524 --> 47:19.192
and then it turned into the wood.

47:19.659 --> 47:21.294
Andy, I want you to
stay away from the rocks.

47:21.362 --> 47:22.362
Do you understand?

47:22.430 --> 47:24.498
Don't pick up anything
else off the beach.

47:24.665 --> 47:26.399
<i>It didn't belong to anybody.</i>

47:26.567 --> 47:27.967
I know, honey. It's all right.

47:28.135 --> 47:29.703
I just don't want you
to pick up anything else

47:29.770 --> 47:31.838
unless you come
and get me first. OK?

47:31.905 --> 47:33.373
<i>OK.</i>

47:34.141 --> 47:35.542
Is Mrs. Kobritz there?

47:35.810 --> 47:37.244
<i>She just came in.</i>

47:37.912 --> 47:41.114
OK. I have to start
the broadcast now.

47:42.181 --> 47:44.617
Andy, promise me you won't
leave the house tonight.

47:44.785 --> 47:46.119
Oh, mom.

47:46.387 --> 47:47.588
<i>Promise me.</i>

47:48.956 --> 47:50.590
Oh, OK.

47:51.558 --> 47:53.092
I love you, Andy.

47:53.260 --> 47:55.762
<i>Me, too, mom. Bye.</i>

48:22.522 --> 48:24.423
Ahoy, maties.

48:24.491 --> 48:26.827
This is Stevie Wayne,
your night light...

48:27.495 --> 48:30.362
And K-A-B, Antonio Bay,
California,

48:30.630 --> 48:31.864
is on the air.

48:32.832 --> 48:34.968
I've lined up some tunes
to help you celebrate

48:35.035 --> 48:37.737
the 100th birthday of Antonio Bay.

48:38.505 --> 48:41.374
So let's get down to business.

49:03.663 --> 49:05.564
What did your mother want, Andy?

49:05.632 --> 49:06.765
Nothing.

49:07.034 --> 49:09.068
Oh, it must have been something.

49:09.236 --> 49:10.904
Mm, nothing.

49:11.472 --> 49:12.839
Hey, Mrs. Kobritz,

49:13.006 --> 49:15.074
what are those clouds out there?

49:21.881 --> 49:23.832
Evidence of deep
penetrating wounds

49:23.885 --> 49:27.620
in each ocular orbit entering
into the cranial cavity.

49:28.388 --> 49:30.389
<i>Also jagged lacerations
to the face...</i>

49:30.457 --> 49:32.091
Do you want to wait out front?

49:32.159 --> 49:33.593
I'd rather wait with you.

49:33.961 --> 49:34.994
OK.

49:35.862 --> 49:36.929
Thorax has been crushed,

49:36.997 --> 49:39.200
and the lungs are
filled with fluid.

49:40.868 --> 49:42.201
Talk to you a minute?

49:42.869 --> 49:43.569
Yeah.

49:49.676 --> 49:51.342
- She gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

49:51.411 --> 49:52.291
Did you talk to Simms?

49:52.379 --> 49:53.346
I got him on the radio.

49:53.414 --> 49:55.247
He's coming back from Bodega Bay.

49:55.415 --> 49:56.749
What the hell happened out there?

49:56.817 --> 49:58.385
There was rust all over everything.

49:58.652 --> 49:59.817
It was like the boat
had been out there

49:59.853 --> 50:01.254
a long time, taking on water.

50:01.322 --> 50:03.190
He was down below near the bunks.

50:03.957 --> 50:05.925
Nick, his wounds are
covered with algae,

50:05.993 --> 50:08.726
his lungs are full, and there's
silt under his fingernails.

50:09.529 --> 50:12.562
I tell you, I saw Dick Baxter
three days ago in Salinas.

50:12.699 --> 50:13.766
Now he's lying in there
on the table

50:13.834 --> 50:16.235
looking like he's been
underwater for a month.

50:39.159 --> 50:41.259
- Do you feel that?
<i>- I'll tell you what happens.</i>

50:41.328 --> 50:44.762
- It just got cold in here.
<i>- You see, the water acts like ice.</i>

50:55.709 --> 50:58.177
A whole body would take
a year to decompose,

50:58.245 --> 51:00.579
longer if it was down far enough,
cold enough.

51:00.748 --> 51:02.114
But he was on the boat.

51:02.382 --> 51:04.150
He was below decks.

51:04.417 --> 51:05.484
No.

51:05.752 --> 51:07.787
Dick Baxter died in the ocean.

51:23.837 --> 51:26.197
You remember last October,
those three kids that went diving

51:26.206 --> 51:28.206
- for that old boat off the point?
- Yeah.

51:28.742 --> 51:30.242
We got to 'em, they'd
been down for a week,

51:30.310 --> 51:31.510
maybe ten days.

51:31.979 --> 51:33.612
I swear to you right now,

51:33.981 --> 51:35.547
he's been down longer.

51:40.988 --> 51:42.488
Aah! Nick!

52:58.298 --> 53:00.433
<i>And while the wrecking
of that beautiful ship</i>

53:00.500 --> 53:02.835
<i>upon our coast was, of course,</i>

53:02.903 --> 53:05.171
<i>a tragedy to those
who were on the ship,</i>

53:06.339 --> 53:09.442
<i>it still was the catalyst
that brought together</i>

53:09.509 --> 53:11.944
<i>all of the people of
this wonderful area.</i>

53:12.412 --> 53:13.645
<i>They came together,</i>

53:13.713 --> 53:16.582
<i>they formed the charter
for Antonio Bay,</i>

53:17.350 --> 53:20.319
<i>the charter by which you have
voted for these councilmen</i>

53:20.487 --> 53:22.822
<i>who sit on my left
and my right tonight.</i>

53:24.724 --> 53:27.025
Kathy, the Coast Guard's
looking for them.

53:27.194 --> 53:29.028
Now, they're gonna cover
the area pretty good,

53:29.096 --> 53:32.465
so, really,
all we can do is wait.

53:33.633 --> 53:35.334
I understand, sheriff.

53:35.802 --> 53:36.969
Thank you.

53:39.205 --> 53:41.140
I got to go. I'm up next.

53:44.377 --> 53:46.712
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Williams.

53:50.082 --> 53:53.450
It's funny...
but all I can think about is

53:54.320 --> 53:56.522
my silly dog barking
all night and,

53:57.590 --> 54:01.025
and me just,
just wishing Al would come home.

54:04.197 --> 54:06.865
Now, we can't have the...

54:06.933 --> 54:09.767
chairlady of the birthday
celebration in tears, can we?

54:09.770 --> 54:10.870
I don't think you ought
to go out there.

54:11.101 --> 54:14.205
Oh, I think that's exactly
what I ought to do.

54:15.708 --> 54:17.743
I appreciate all your help, Nick.

54:18.111 --> 54:19.311
That's all right.

54:37.330 --> 54:39.531
<i>I searched a long
time for this one.</i>

54:39.799 --> 54:41.768
<i>I hope you remember it.</i>

54:46.639 --> 54:48.574
<i>Happy 100th, Antonio Bay.</i>

54:48.742 --> 54:51.643
<i>The ceremonies are underway
at Shelby Square.</i>

54:51.811 --> 54:53.812
<i>And we'll have that
candlelight procession</i>

54:53.881 --> 54:55.214
<i>in about an hour.</i>

54:55.482 --> 54:57.884
<i>So if you hurry,
you can still make it.</i>

54:58.351 --> 54:59.786
<i>The coast guard dropped me a note</i>

54:59.853 --> 55:02.821
<i>saying they found the Sea Grass
earlier this afternoon,</i>

55:03.189 --> 55:05.992
<i>but there's no further word
as to the condition of the ship</i>

55:06.259 --> 55:08.094
<i>or the men on-board.</i>

55:08.761 --> 55:11.397
<i>I'll keep you posted
as the news comes in to me.</i>

55:12.064 --> 55:14.833
<i>Hope no one else gets lost
out there in the fog.</i>

55:19.371 --> 55:20.539
I'll be right back.

55:29.182 --> 55:30.082
K-A-B.

55:30.150 --> 55:31.850
Hello.
My name's Nick Castle.

55:31.918 --> 55:33.785
You don't know me,
but <i>I'm one of the men</i>

55:33.853 --> 55:35.387
<i>who found the Sea Grass
this afternoon.</i>

55:35.655 --> 55:36.388
Oh, I'm sorry.

55:36.456 --> 55:37.896
I really don't have
any further word.

55:37.957 --> 55:38.690
<i>I understand.</i>

55:38.758 --> 55:41.759
That's not what I called about.
It's... uh, you just mentioned

55:41.828 --> 55:43.830
something now on the
radio about the fog.

55:53.539 --> 55:55.674
Well, this is going to
sound a little strange.

55:57.842 --> 56:00.912
<i>I saw the fog last night out
in the ocean in the distance.</i>

56:01.114 --> 56:03.715
<i>It was... glowing.</i>

56:09.889 --> 56:11.289
Well, what seemed to
be happening is

56:11.324 --> 56:14.959
that the wind was moving due east,
and the fog just kept moving west.

56:15.362 --> 56:16.863
I know that sounds
completely crazy.

56:17.130 --> 56:18.331
Right now it doesn't.

56:18.398 --> 56:20.332
<i>Something happened last night.</i>

56:20.700 --> 56:22.261
At the same time that
fog was moving in,

56:22.269 --> 56:25.437
this whole town went unglued.
Hold on.

56:30.243 --> 56:32.411
I've got some more
birthday music for you

56:32.479 --> 56:34.413
and a few other surprises.

56:34.481 --> 56:37.182
<i>Then I'll be ready to check in
with the weatherman.</i>

56:37.784 --> 56:41.020
And the weatherman will be
ready to check in with you.

56:52.265 --> 56:53.698
- Hello?
- Yeah, I'm still here.

56:53.767 --> 56:55.067
There's one other thing.

56:55.435 --> 56:57.737
<i>It may have nothing to
do with the Sea Grass.</i>

56:58.105 --> 56:59.338
<i>Oh, anything.</i>

57:00.406 --> 57:04.109
My son found a piece of
driftwood this morning.

57:10.282 --> 57:12.418
Hey, hey, Mel.
How you doing?

57:13.285 --> 57:16.186
Your girlfriend on the radio
has been talking about you.

57:16.189 --> 57:18.124
I came in tonight
just to keep her happy.

57:18.191 --> 57:19.792
Yeah.
I thought you were off tonight.

57:19.859 --> 57:20.960
I love my job.

57:21.428 --> 57:22.028
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

57:22.095 --> 57:24.397
You can tell them all
about that big fog bank

57:24.464 --> 57:25.831
moving in the southeast there.

57:26.298 --> 57:27.333
Where?

57:27.500 --> 57:30.634
Oh, you'll see it. I'm on my way.
See you tomorrow.

57:30.703 --> 57:32.371
Yeah, Mel.
I'll see you.

57:39.679 --> 57:41.247
Ah.

57:42.815 --> 57:44.049
<i>There you are.</i>

57:54.527 --> 57:55.861
I've got to make a run
out to the lighthouse

57:55.929 --> 57:57.263
at Spivey Point.
Want to come?

57:57.331 --> 57:58.864
- Sure.
- Come on.

58:03.369 --> 58:04.536
K-A-B.

58:04.604 --> 58:05.537
<i>Hi, sweetheart!</i>

58:05.805 --> 58:07.373
I thought you were celebrating.

58:07.640 --> 58:10.208
I couldn't spend
an evening without you.

58:10.276 --> 58:12.777
Well, I'm up in about 30
seconds. What's new?

58:12.846 --> 58:14.347
<i>Another fog bank.</i>

58:15.214 --> 58:16.214
Where?

58:16.382 --> 58:18.484
<i>It's coming in off the
ocean from the southeast.</i>

58:18.551 --> 58:20.186
It's heading inland.
It should be here

58:20.254 --> 58:22.355
at the weather station
in 5-10 minutes.

58:23.423 --> 58:24.923
Dan, hold on.

58:26.393 --> 58:28.427
I have a special weather bulletin.

58:28.495 --> 58:30.928
The Tri-County Weather Station
reports a fog bank

58:31.131 --> 58:33.432
moving southeast along the coast.

58:33.500 --> 58:35.066
For whoever's interested,

58:35.134 --> 58:37.903
<i>that's the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.</i>

58:38.370 --> 58:39.471
<i>Repeating,</i>

58:39.539 --> 58:42.374
<i>a fog bank is moving
southwest along the coast</i>

58:42.442 --> 58:45.344
<i>toward the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.</i>

58:50.916 --> 58:52.417
Dan, are you still there?

58:52.485 --> 58:54.153
I'm still here.
Heh heh heh.

58:54.621 --> 58:56.722
Hey, you, uh,
sound different tonight,

58:56.790 --> 58:58.191
<i>uh, kind of intense.</i>

58:59.158 --> 59:01.092
I just feel like talking,
that's all.

59:01.260 --> 59:02.428
<i>Wait a minute.
I thought you told me</i>

59:02.496 --> 59:03.896
<i>you didn't like to
talk on the telephone</i>

59:03.963 --> 59:05.431
<i>because you talked
on the radio all day.</i>

59:05.499 --> 59:06.765
Dan, where's the fog now?

59:06.833 --> 59:09.802
Well, it should be right
outside my door now.

59:13.038 --> 59:14.974
Hold on.
I'm going to try something.

59:20.379 --> 59:21.646
<i>I can see it.</i>

59:21.715 --> 59:23.916
Hey, now, what is the big deal?

59:23.983 --> 59:26.118
You've seen fog once,
you seen it for life.

59:26.286 --> 59:28.326
No. There's something
different about this fog, Dan.

59:28.354 --> 59:29.321
It glows.

59:29.489 --> 59:30.923
<i>Can't you see anything yet?</i>

59:30.990 --> 59:34.426
Glows?
Oh, I get it.

59:34.493 --> 59:36.629
You take something to
keep you going, right?

59:36.696 --> 59:39.098
Does it make you feel
a little weird sometimes?

59:40.534 --> 59:42.102
- Hey.
<i>- What?</i>

59:43.469 --> 59:44.804
The lights went out.

59:45.571 --> 59:47.941
Everything's going crazy.

59:48.508 --> 59:51.176
Barometer's falling,
temperature's dropping.

59:51.244 --> 59:54.413
<i>- Dan, what is it?</i>
- What the hell's that?

59:54.581 --> 59:56.548
Dan, what is it?
What's happening?

59:56.616 --> 59:58.651
What is it?
<i>What's happening?</i>

59:59.019 --> 01:00:01.153
Someone's shining a light
through the window.

01:00:01.421 --> 01:00:02.389
<i>Dan, listen to me.</i>

01:00:02.457 --> 01:00:05.657
Hold on, sweetheart.
I wanna check this out.

01:00:06.493 --> 01:00:07.760
<i>Dan!</i>

01:00:08.628 --> 01:00:10.396
<i>Dan, stay on the phone!</i>

01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:24.977
This has got to be a joke.

01:00:30.383 --> 01:00:33.986
<i>Someone's at the front door,
sweetheart, playing a stupid joke.</i>

01:00:34.853 --> 01:00:39.257
And whoever it is... they ain't
gonna like finding me home.

01:00:39.425 --> 01:00:41.026
Dan, stay away from the door!

01:00:41.694 --> 01:00:43.228
<i>Dan!</i>

01:00:44.898 --> 01:00:47.866
<i>Dan!</i>

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.707
Hello?

01:00:58.210 --> 01:00:59.477
Anybody here?

01:01:03.116 --> 01:01:05.187
Some asshole got drunk
and started taking

01:01:05.188 --> 01:01:07.188
this 100-year-old
business too seriously.

01:01:09.956 --> 01:01:11.323
Dan!

01:01:14.493 --> 01:01:16.161
Dan!

01:01:19.299 --> 01:01:21.666
Aaaah!

01:01:31.077 --> 01:01:32.177
Dan.

01:02:00.674 --> 01:02:04.910
And so all of us living
here in Antonio Bay today

01:02:05.278 --> 01:02:06.979
owe a great debt of gratitude

01:02:07.046 --> 01:02:09.448
to those men and women
a hundred years ago

01:02:09.716 --> 01:02:12.951
<i>who struggled and sacrificed
to make this town grow</i>

01:02:13.019 --> 01:02:14.386
<i>into what it is today.</i>

01:02:14.554 --> 01:02:18.754
And it's up to us to keep
their kind of spirit alive.

01:02:24.196 --> 01:02:25.236
I have an urgent bulletin.

01:02:25.564 --> 01:02:29.068
Will sheriff David Simms please
contact K-A-B radio immediately?

01:02:29.135 --> 01:02:32.371
The number is 555-2131.

01:02:32.438 --> 01:02:34.039
This is an emergency.

01:02:36.342 --> 01:02:40.245
So we must redouble our efforts,
work together.

01:02:40.713 --> 01:02:43.015
We have a vital,
thriving community.

01:02:43.083 --> 01:02:45.217
And I say we have to
keep it that way.

01:02:48.688 --> 01:02:50.168
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

01:02:50.256 --> 01:02:53.793
<i>Sheriff David Simms, please
contact K-A-B immediately.</i>

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:57.963
<i>555-2131.
This is an emergency.</i>

01:03:06.906 --> 01:03:07.973
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello?

01:03:10.443 --> 01:03:11.310
Hello?

01:03:13.313 --> 01:03:14.313
Sheriff Simms?

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:23.860
And so, as we make our way to
the presentation of the statue,

01:03:24.195 --> 01:03:27.404
<i>I think we should all keep in mind
the significance of this night</i>

01:03:27.739 --> 01:03:29.862
<i>for every citizen of Antonio Bay.</i>

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:21.647
We should all proceed
over to the statue.

01:04:22.115 --> 01:04:25.349
<i>Single file. Don't push.
Take your time.</i>

01:04:39.164 --> 01:04:40.165
Andy!

01:04:52.245 --> 01:04:53.579
Start!

01:04:54.447 --> 01:04:56.114
Please start!

01:05:00.519 --> 01:05:02.054
<i>Why did all the lights go out?</i>

01:05:02.422 --> 01:05:05.691
Oh, one of the lines
are probably down, Andy.

01:05:07.359 --> 01:05:10.695
They usually take care
of these things right away.

01:05:10.963 --> 01:05:12.898
I think it's kind of neat.

01:05:25.644 --> 01:05:26.678
<i>Hello?</i>

01:05:28.147 --> 01:05:29.081
Hello?

01:05:41.127 --> 01:05:42.760
What's that now?

01:05:59.445 --> 01:06:01.012
Start!

01:06:06.919 --> 01:06:08.920
Andy!
Andy, get out of the house!

01:06:08.988 --> 01:06:10.355
Mrs. Kobritz,
get him out of the house.

01:06:10.423 --> 01:06:11.623
Please! Run!

01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:14.526
I think maybe we better
close all the windows, Andy.

01:06:14.594 --> 01:06:16.061
Are your bedroom windows closed?

01:06:16.129 --> 01:06:17.462
I'll go see.

01:06:19.098 --> 01:06:20.332
Hello?

01:06:26.272 --> 01:06:28.673
Someone listen to me!
My son is trapped!

01:06:28.941 --> 01:06:31.676
887 White Beach Lane!
My son is trapped by the fog!

01:06:31.744 --> 01:06:33.912
Andy, get out of the house!
Run!

01:06:39.284 --> 01:06:41.786
Wow!
Look at that!

01:06:42.054 --> 01:06:44.456
- Are your windows all closed?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:06:44.524 --> 01:06:46.025
I wonder about
your mother's bedroom.

01:06:58.137 --> 01:07:01.073
Please, someone!
My son is trapped!

01:07:03.776 --> 01:07:05.643
<i>Andy, run! Run!</i>

01:07:05.911 --> 01:07:08.046
<i>Mrs. Kobritz, run!</i>

01:07:11.283 --> 01:07:13.585
Andy, I want you
to go to your room.

01:07:14.053 --> 01:07:15.387
I think I should stay.

01:07:15.455 --> 01:07:16.854
Right now. Right now.

01:07:16.922 --> 01:07:17.889
- Yes.
- Right now.

01:07:39.111 --> 01:07:40.078
Go to your room.

01:07:40.246 --> 01:07:41.779
I want to see who it is.

01:07:41.847 --> 01:07:43.081
No.

01:07:43.348 --> 01:07:45.117
<i>Can't I stay for 2 more seconds?</i>

01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:50.922
<i>OK, OK, I'm going.</i>

01:08:04.703 --> 01:08:06.771
Mrs. Kobritz?

01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:11.809
Mrs. Kobritz?

01:08:16.849 --> 01:08:19.051
Please.
My son is trapped!

01:08:19.417 --> 01:08:22.787
<i>887 White Beach Lane.</i>

01:08:22.956 --> 01:08:25.724
<i>Someone get to 887
White Beach Lane.</i>

01:08:27.727 --> 01:08:29.560
Mrs. Kobritz?

01:08:38.103 --> 01:08:41.274
<i>My son is trapped!
Get him out of the fog!</i>

01:08:48.913 --> 01:08:50.182
<i>Please, someone.</i>

01:08:52.085 --> 01:08:53.818
<i>My son is trapped!</i>

01:08:55.254 --> 01:08:56.821
<i>877 White Beach Lane.</i>

01:09:02.495 --> 01:09:04.363
<i>Come on!
Get out of there, now!</i>

01:09:13.073 --> 01:09:16.308
<i>Andy, run! Run!</i>

01:09:18.877 --> 01:09:20.612
Come on!
Come on.

01:09:20.879 --> 01:09:22.214
Go! Go!

01:09:34.993 --> 01:09:36.060
Come on!

01:09:36.127 --> 01:09:38.696
<i>Ease it, don't pop it.
Try to ease it out.</i>

01:09:39.532 --> 01:09:40.965
Oh, Jesus.

01:09:47.171 --> 01:09:48.506
Come on, Beth!
Come on.

01:09:48.774 --> 01:09:51.175
Come on. Come on.
It'll go. It'll go. It'll go.

01:09:51.243 --> 01:09:52.210
Nick!

01:09:52.277 --> 01:09:53.711
<i>Reverse! Reverse!</i>

01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:54.779
Come on!

01:10:01.954 --> 01:10:03.688
Come on, do it!
Do it!

01:10:27.946 --> 01:10:30.482
<i>...wait for the last 20 minutes.</i>

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:32.851
I think it's best we
call it a night here.

01:10:33.418 --> 01:10:36.188
Another 5 or 10 minutes, everyone
will have seen the statue.

01:10:36.255 --> 01:10:38.790
All right, but let's get 'em
through as quickly as we can.

01:10:38.857 --> 01:10:41.425
It'd probably be a good idea
if you went home, Kathy.

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:42.761
We can close up here.

01:10:42.828 --> 01:10:43.963
I should see it
through to the end.

01:10:43.968 --> 01:10:46.736
Mrs. Williams, there's
nothing more to do here.

01:10:46.799 --> 01:10:48.433
Let me take you home.

01:10:49.401 --> 01:10:51.770
A little annoying,
but you're right.

01:10:52.137 --> 01:10:53.171
Would you please take me?

01:10:53.239 --> 01:10:54.172
Yes, ma'am.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.540
- I'll call you tomorrow, Kathy.
- OK, thank you.

01:11:01.647 --> 01:11:03.881
<i>Andy, I don't even know
if you can hear me.</i>

01:11:04.449 --> 01:11:07.584
<i>I'm sorry that I didn't come
for you, that I wasn't there.</i>

01:11:09.154 --> 01:11:10.822
Andy, please understand.

01:11:13.592 --> 01:11:15.493
I have to stay here.

01:11:26.772 --> 01:11:30.209
The fog...
is moving inland

01:11:31.376 --> 01:11:32.982
<i>away from the beach</i>

01:11:35.783 --> 01:11:37.483
<i>towards Antonio Bay.</i>

01:11:43.789 --> 01:11:45.624
<i>It's over by the armory.</i>

01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:47.793
<i>I can't remember
the name of the...</i>

01:11:48.861 --> 01:11:51.029
<i>No, no...
I think it's Chestnut.</i>

01:11:56.635 --> 01:11:58.570
Feel like listening
to some music?

01:11:59.938 --> 01:12:01.206
Sure.

01:12:01.974 --> 01:12:03.808
<i>It's moving faster now.</i>

01:12:04.076 --> 01:12:05.343
<i>Up Regent Avenue.</i>

01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:07.178
<i>Up to the end of Smallhouse Road.</i>

01:12:07.446 --> 01:12:08.746
What's that?

01:12:11.784 --> 01:12:13.818
<i>It's just hitting
the outskirts of town.</i>

01:12:14.286 --> 01:12:15.720
<i>Broad street.</i>

01:12:17.623 --> 01:12:19.291
<i>Clay Street.</i>

01:12:20.158 --> 01:12:21.325
Nick!

01:12:46.351 --> 01:12:48.285
<i>It's moving down 10th street.</i>

01:12:48.353 --> 01:12:50.021
<i>Get inside and lock your doors.</i>

01:12:50.088 --> 01:12:51.589
<i>Close your windows.</i>

01:12:51.657 --> 01:12:53.358
<i>There's something in the fog.</i>

01:13:00.398 --> 01:13:02.867
<i>If you're on the South
side of town, go north.</i>

01:13:03.035 --> 01:13:04.869
Stay away from the fog.

01:13:13.312 --> 01:13:17.282
<i>Richardsville pike up to Beacon
Hill is the only clear road.</i>

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:19.484
<i>Up to the church.</i>

01:13:19.952 --> 01:13:22.721
<i>If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.</i>

01:13:30.496 --> 01:13:32.797
<i>Now the junction
at 101 is cut off.</i>

01:13:33.265 --> 01:13:36.601
<i>If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.</i>

01:13:36.669 --> 01:13:38.736
<i>It's the only place left to go.</i>

01:13:39.004 --> 01:13:41.505
<i>Get to the old church
on Beacon Hill.</i>

01:13:49.847 --> 01:13:50.514
<i>It cut us off!</i>

01:13:50.682 --> 01:13:52.085
- Where is it?
- Right behind us in the driveway.

01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:53.250
Quick, inside.

01:13:57.055 --> 01:13:57.889
<i>Come on.</i>

01:13:58.557 --> 01:13:59.824
<i>Hurry.</i>

01:14:01.459 --> 01:14:02.394
<i>Father?</i>

01:14:02.461 --> 01:14:04.228
Is there a basement
or cellar in here?

01:14:04.297 --> 01:14:06.163
- We can't hide any longer.
- We have to try!

01:14:06.166 --> 01:14:08.466
No matter where we go,
it will find us.

01:14:12.538 --> 01:14:14.306
Is there a basement
or cellar here, Father?

01:14:14.373 --> 01:14:16.008
There's a study in back.
I'll show you the way.

01:14:16.075 --> 01:14:17.875
Come on.
Hurry.

01:14:18.043 --> 01:14:19.778
Come on.
Give me that.

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:51.175
The fog is sweeping inland.

01:14:52.944 --> 01:14:55.513
<i>It's almost like a wall
across the east end of town.</i>

01:15:20.539 --> 01:15:21.773
Blake and his men
have come for us.

01:15:21.778 --> 01:15:23.574
- Who's Blake?
- Oh, it's in the journal.

01:15:23.742 --> 01:15:25.743
- What journal?
- I don't know.

01:15:25.811 --> 01:15:27.367
- Father, where's the journal?
- What are you talking about?

01:15:27.372 --> 01:15:28.589
- What?
- Where's the journal?

01:15:28.614 --> 01:15:29.948
It's... It's in there.

01:15:37.155 --> 01:15:38.156
Over by the window?

01:15:38.223 --> 01:15:40.591
- It can do us no good now.
- It's all we've got.

01:15:40.793 --> 01:15:42.960
If anything happens,
just lock the door.

01:15:43.028 --> 01:15:45.229
Get back.
Shut the door.

01:16:25.404 --> 01:16:28.004
- "Six must die." That was on the...
- The three men on the <i>Sea Grass.</i>

01:16:28.074 --> 01:16:29.915
- And the weatherman is four.
<i>- Mrs. Kobritz.</i>

01:16:29.976 --> 01:16:32.518
- Yeah, five.
- And one of us makes six.

01:16:32.578 --> 01:16:33.978
That's what they want.
They've come back

01:16:34.046 --> 01:16:35.747
for the six original conspirators.

01:16:35.815 --> 01:16:37.081
There must be something in here!

01:16:37.149 --> 01:16:39.717
- It's me they want. I am the!
- Why would they want you?

01:16:39.785 --> 01:16:41.352
Wait, father.
You didn't read us this.

01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:43.354
Look. "Were it possible
to raise the dead,

01:16:43.422 --> 01:16:45.790
<i>"I would return Blake's
fortune to him intact,</i>

01:16:45.858 --> 01:16:48.560
<i>"save the money spent on
these walls that hide it."</i>

01:16:48.627 --> 01:16:50.395
"My fellow conspirators believe

01:16:50.463 --> 01:16:53.130
"that the confiscated fortune
has been stolen from them,

01:16:53.298 --> 01:16:55.299
"when in fact, I am the thief,

01:16:55.367 --> 01:16:58.002
and God's temple is
the tomb of gold."

01:16:58.270 --> 01:17:00.838
"I am the thief, and God's
temple is the tomb..."

01:17:03.575 --> 01:17:05.443
Now, wait. Get...
get rid of that.

01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:07.211
<i>Nick!</i>

01:17:07.279 --> 01:17:09.614
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:17:30.969 --> 01:17:33.103
- Give me a hand.
- Andy, stay right there.

01:17:35.906 --> 01:17:37.074
Nick.

01:17:58.196 --> 01:17:59.263
<i>The gold.</i>

01:18:18.717 --> 01:18:20.885
He melted down the gold into this.

01:18:22.921 --> 01:18:23.955
Aah!

01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:26.050
<i>Somebody help her!</i>

01:18:34.766 --> 01:18:36.266
<i>Nick, no!</i>

01:18:39.104 --> 01:18:41.737
Don't go in there!

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:25.216
Blake, I have your gold.

01:19:33.057 --> 01:19:34.091
Blake?

01:20:11.897 --> 01:20:13.598
This is your gold, Blake.

01:20:14.966 --> 01:20:17.301
<i>My grandfather stole
it from you.</i>

01:20:19.571 --> 01:20:21.640
I'm the one who must
answer for it.

01:20:35.653 --> 01:20:37.622
I'm the sixth conspirator.

01:20:40.358 --> 01:20:42.260
I'm father Malone.

01:20:43.728 --> 01:20:45.363
Take me.

01:21:41.953 --> 01:21:43.120
Father Malone!

01:24:03.528 --> 01:24:04.562
Look.

01:24:14.972 --> 01:24:16.473
It's going away.

01:24:52.576 --> 01:24:55.379
<i>I don't know what happened
to Antonio Bay tonight.</i>

01:24:56.447 --> 01:25:00.685
Something came out of the fog
and tried to destroy us.

01:25:02.453 --> 01:25:04.521
In one moment, it vanished.

01:25:05.289 --> 01:25:07.593
But if this has been
anything but a nightmare

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:12.032
and if we don't wake up to find
ourselves safe in our beds,

01:25:13.239 --> 01:25:15.109
it could come again.

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:19.403
To the ships at sea
who can hear my voice,

01:25:20.271 --> 01:25:23.341
look across the water
into the darkness.

01:25:25.977 --> 01:25:27.511
Look for the fog.

01:25:57.141 --> 01:25:59.143
Why not six, Blake?

01:26:02.279 --> 01:26:03.647
Why not me?

01:26:04.305 --> 01:26:10.802
