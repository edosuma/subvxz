-Oh! Oh, thank you so much.

-The pleasure is all mine.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.452
We're still, okay?

00:17.626 --> 00:19.149
Oh, what about Cath's hair?

00:19.323 --> 00:21.673
-Uh-oh!
-Careful, careful.
You mad woman.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.110
You are crazy, yeah?

00:23.284 --> 00:25.155
Seriously though,
what she look like?

00:25.329 --> 00:27.592
- Paul McCartney.
- Fuck you.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.594
Yeah, you're right.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.728
Hmm. God,
I never wanna do that thing.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.296
What? Get fat and have bad hair?

00:35.470 --> 00:36.471
Mm, no.

00:37.646 --> 00:39.865

and just decide to be old.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.607

00:43.565 --> 00:47.699
I'm Gemini.
I got youthful energy.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.223

to stay at any age,
what, what would it be?

00:55.011 --> 00:57.927
I don't know.
I mean, I'm probably
not even there yet, you know?

00:58.449 --> 01:01.365
-Yeah.
-I reckon one day, I'm gonna be
a right, sexy silver fox.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.541
Yeah, I reckon you will,
you smooth bastard.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.676
Well, I still feel 23

01:07.850 --> 01:11.158

not hanging up my party shoes.

01:11.332 --> 01:12.289

01:13.334 --> 01:14.770
-Thank God for that.
-Mm.

Let's get you back to mine.

-No. No. You've done those

04:48.636 --> 04:52.117
Thursday? You were seeking
your unfucking thing.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.599
- That's different.
- Oh, yeah? Why is that?

04:55.773 --> 04:58.167

Yeah, but you were before.
Remember?

06:16.419 --> 06:17.507
There was a kid in that car.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.379
But did I hit the kid?

06:20.684 --> 06:21.859
No. Exactly, so...

06:22.643 --> 06:24.993
Bullshit. Bullshit.

It's okay. It's okay.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.530

It's alright.
-I killed him.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.023
-It's alright. Look at me.
-I killed him.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.807

-I killed him.

-I killed him.

you'll drink
your bank account dry.

08:45.002 --> 08:46.830
There will be no job for me

18:35.462 --> 18:37.812
I'd like to work
in a diner like this.

18:41.076 --> 18:42.295
Look at these, so cute,

18:42.469 --> 18:43.600
like toys.

18:47.213 --> 18:48.866
Can't imagine
these girls make much.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.218
I'd have a song, too.

18:59.964 --> 19:02.793
<i>♪ I'm here to serve you now ♪</i>

19:03.316 --> 19:06.493
<i>♪ Have your burger anyhow ♪</i>

19:06.667 --> 19:07.668

19:07.842 --> 19:08.930

19:09.626 --> 19:11.628
<i>-♪ ...anyhow ♪</i>
-Seriously.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.326
Get something down.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.067
-You'll feel better.
-I don't wanna feel better.

19:16.633 --> 19:19.201
Look, I don't know
when we're gonna get
the chance to eat again.

19:20.681 --> 19:21.725
What am I gonna do about school?

19:21.899 --> 19:23.205
I don't know. I need...

19:23.727 --> 19:24.859
I need time to think.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.517
Do you want to get me
into trouble or something?

19:33.650 --> 19:35.130
Why can't we say
it was self-defense?

19:35.304 --> 19:36.523
Say he was hurting Izzy.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.742
Look, Kevin
had his problems, yes.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.657
But I would never go out
with someone who hurt my kids.

19:40.831 --> 19:41.919
Oh, yeah.

19:42.485 --> 19:43.878
You should probably write
parenting guides.

19:45.923 --> 19:48.012
Dylan. Dylan.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.884
Everything alright?

19:50.058 --> 19:51.277
Yeah.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.627
Yes, just what we needed.
Thanks.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.716
Actually, um...

19:56.847 --> 19:59.415
Uh, do you happen to know
if we are anywhere
near here at all?

20:00.503 --> 20:01.852
Have you heard of Google Maps?

20:04.246 --> 20:05.247
I'm going to the toilet.

20:06.640 --> 20:07.771
Teenagers.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.914
It was a loose connection
to your starter motor.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.525
Is it gonna be alright?

20:23.309 --> 20:24.353
Yeah, probably.

20:25.006 --> 20:27.008
-For a while.
-A while? How long is a while?

20:28.444 --> 20:30.141
What am I gonna do
if it breaks down again?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.232
Look, where'd you say
you were going?

20:36.017 --> 20:37.061
Because we're going down
the coast.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.280
If that's any good to you?

20:41.936 --> 20:43.546
Yeah. Okay.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.896
And if you travel with us,
you've gotta promise
to keep it running.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.508
-Mom!
-Can you fix the car?

20:51.206 --> 20:53.991
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Okay.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.004
We don't know him.

21:07.657 --> 21:09.180
Look, he's going to pick
some bloody fruit

21:09.355 --> 21:10.312
or something and his mates
have let him down.

21:10.486 --> 21:11.966
What more do you need to know?

21:12.140 --> 21:13.184
I need some help here.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.186

Tell me.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.362
Can I have a cigarette first?

24:18.544 --> 24:19.588
You got a light?

24:32.558 --> 24:34.429
Yeah, she rang me.

24:35.343 --> 24:36.387
She told me what happened.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.304
And you know
what your brother was.

24:41.218 --> 24:43.351
A piece of shit. Of course,
this was coming to him.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.615
She deserved more than him.
The kids deserved more.

24:48.051 --> 24:51.664
I told her to get as far away
from here as possible.

24:53.404 --> 24:54.754
I don't know where she is, Pete.

24:55.972 --> 24:57.234
But, if I did,

24:57.800 --> 25:00.281
you will be
the last person I'd tell.

25:23.217 --> 25:24.261
You bastard.

25:26.220 --> 25:27.264
Sorry.

25:27.743 --> 25:28.831
You're coming with me.

25:30.703 --> 25:32.182
Don't touch my hair.

25:42.236 --> 25:43.716
So, where have you
come from then?

25:44.717 --> 25:45.718
Nowhere really.

25:48.372 --> 25:49.809
You must have
come from somewhere.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.334
Where've you been?

26:00.297 --> 26:01.298
Pull your hand in.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.474
Come on, please,
don't mess about.

26:03.649 --> 26:04.737
Get your hand back in.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.783
-What, this hand?
-Get your hand
back in the vehicle!

26:14.050 --> 26:15.182
Sorry.

26:15.356 --> 26:16.705
It's dangerous.

26:21.623 --> 26:22.885
Always wears those, does he?

26:25.888 --> 26:26.889
Blocks out the noise.

26:31.894 --> 26:32.895
I should get a pair.

27:21.901 --> 27:22.902
You alright?

27:27.994 --> 27:28.995
Where are we?

27:30.083 --> 27:31.650
What the hell
are you dreaming about?

27:33.739 --> 27:35.044
Must have been something bad.

27:35.218 --> 27:36.959
Um, alright, well, this is us.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.309
So, I... If I unpack
and get rid of the kids,

27:39.483 --> 27:40.789
I can drop you back
at the main road, yeah?

27:40.963 --> 27:42.704
Uh, no, it's alright. I'll, uh,

27:42.878 --> 27:45.054
I'll probably pitch up
around there somewhere.

27:45.228 --> 27:47.056
-I'm knackered.
-I thought you had
work lined up.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.712
I have, but I've got
a few days to kill.

28:14.170 --> 28:15.171
See ya.

28:55.777 --> 28:56.778
Dyl.

28:58.562 --> 28:59.781
You have to do this for Iz.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.268
Did you sleep alright, love?

29:09.399 --> 29:10.487
Is there any tea?

29:11.750 --> 29:14.143
Uh, God, the,

29:14.317 --> 29:15.362
the cook is broken.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.278
So, here,

29:18.844 --> 29:19.845
have a bit of fag.

31:05.907 --> 31:08.040
I need tea.

31:08.214 --> 31:10.999
Yeah, well, I said we should've
picked something proper
up on the way.

31:11.957 --> 31:12.958
Go find a shop then.

31:14.437 --> 31:15.438
Stop moaning.

31:21.531 --> 31:22.706
Oh.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.154
Dylan, no, that's disgusting.

31:37.678 --> 31:39.114
Do you think a fox had it?

31:40.159 --> 31:41.290
And left it hung on a tree?

31:42.291 --> 31:43.510
Doubt it.

31:43.684 --> 31:44.728
Well, who killed it then?

31:44.903 --> 31:45.904
I did.

31:48.341 --> 31:49.559
You're still here?

31:52.171 --> 31:53.128
Did it suffer?

31:53.868 --> 31:54.913
No.

31:57.741 --> 32:02.007
You, uh, shoot it in the head
or the back end
if you want to eat it.

32:02.964 --> 32:05.010
A center hit will ruin the meat.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.535
- See?
- That's grim.

32:10.493 --> 32:11.494
You eat chicken, dickhead.

32:16.760 --> 32:17.892
Found the shop?

32:18.719 --> 32:19.981
Found the guy from last night.

32:20.764 --> 32:21.983
You never said he was staying.

32:22.505 --> 32:24.333
But...
it's a free country, Iz.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.031
What am I supposed to do
about it?

32:28.685 --> 32:30.600
I told him the stove
wasn't working.

32:31.775 --> 32:32.907
I can take a look if you like.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.867
Um... yeah.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.227
Hold that up.

32:49.271 --> 32:50.272
Harder.

32:52.796 --> 32:55.234
We'll use these later, but we're
gonna need some smaller tools,

32:55.408 --> 32:56.800
alright? Hold down there, look.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.890
So what we'll do is
we'll just add...

33:00.065 --> 33:01.414
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:03.329 --> 33:05.940
And then we're gonna add this,
alright?

33:10.901 --> 33:12.512
So, what are you gonna
cook on it?

33:13.295 --> 33:16.255
I don't know. Probably nothing.
I like watching it.

33:23.697 --> 33:25.046
You're decorating already?

33:26.004 --> 33:27.788
Well, I can't sleep
in the dark, can I?

33:27.962 --> 33:29.485
God, you're like
the opposite of a vampire.

33:29.659 --> 33:32.184
What does that make you?
My angel.

33:34.577 --> 33:36.014
Actually, you might wanna
hang those back up, babe.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.450
You don't want him
peering in on you.

33:38.146 --> 33:39.147
Dyl?

34:44.691 --> 34:45.735
Alright.

34:46.562 --> 34:47.563
Dig.

34:49.043 --> 34:50.088
What?

34:51.567 --> 34:52.699
A hole.

34:55.397 --> 34:56.398
Dig a hole.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.226
Well, how big?

34:59.184 --> 35:00.402
As big as a grave.

35:01.751 --> 35:02.796
Go on.

35:14.982 --> 35:16.114

she's not at work?

35:16.288 --> 35:17.637

35:25.035 --> 35:26.080

<i>Now, why would Milan</i>

35:34.044 --> 35:35.481
<i>go off with Pete?</i>

35:38.527 --> 35:40.007
You know,
Milan can handle herself.

35:41.313 --> 35:42.357
Don't worry.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.273
<i>Is there something</i><i>
you're not telling me?</i>

35:46.187 --> 35:48.581
Look, um, I've got to go.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.454
I'll call you soon
as she gets in touch. Yeah?

36:24.138 --> 36:25.183
Fuck.

36:27.402 --> 36:28.708
Pete, just leave us alone.

36:39.719 --> 36:40.720
Oh.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.029
Is that big enough?

36:55.038 --> 36:56.257
Lie in it.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.564
Pete, please.
There's no need to do this.

36:58.738 --> 37:00.000
Get in the fucking hole!

37:13.622 --> 37:14.841

37:25.025 --> 37:26.069
Oh, come on.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.116
Where?

37:31.379 --> 37:32.380
To get my brother.

37:39.909 --> 37:43.783
Okay. Alright.

"The body that is sown

38:42.668 --> 38:43.886
Oh, we're just on a trip,
aren't we?

38:44.060 --> 38:45.061
An adventure.

38:45.758 --> 38:46.889
Some adventure.

And I'm,
I'm gonna need your phones.

38:50.066 --> 38:52.765
- For fuck's sake, Mom!
- Oi, language!

38:53.896 --> 38:55.158
I wanted to take some pics.

38:55.333 --> 38:56.595
Ah, the last thing I need
is you posting

38:56.769 --> 38:58.292
bloody photos of the woods
everywhere.

38:59.641 --> 39:00.860
Come on, hand them over.

-Alright.
-I'm gonna have a real problem
reaching that, aren't I?

39:15.570 --> 39:17.964
You're pretty funny, Dyl.
Yeah, these things
could get us bloody killed.

- I don't know.

I, I need some peace.
Come on, get out.

39:27.626 --> 39:29.018
Get some fresh air.
Come on, outside.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.414
Iz, come on, please.

39:34.067 --> 39:35.373
Thank you.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.978
Hey, if you can't afford them,
please put the goods back.

40:16.152 --> 40:18.067
Calm down, Abdul.

40:19.112 --> 40:20.287
Put it on my tab, yeah?

40:35.563 --> 40:37.913
For God's sake,
please pay the money.

40:39.045 --> 40:40.307
You need to pay for your stuff.

40:42.570 --> 40:43.876
You should fuck off.

40:44.050 --> 40:45.399
Pay the man.

41:30.792 --> 41:32.228
Do you reckon
this would even float?

41:34.274 --> 41:35.493
Well, it's a boat, isn't it?

41:35.667 --> 41:37.712
Duh. But I don't know,
it looks rotten.

41:37.886 --> 41:39.018
I'll ask Tom.

41:40.976 --> 41:43.805
Tom?
Do you wanna marry him?

41:47.592 --> 41:48.636
Dyl, stop.

41:49.811 --> 41:51.552
-I didn't touch you.
-You did. Mm.

41:52.684 --> 41:54.381
Mm. Stop.

41:58.124 --> 41:59.038
What have you found?

41:59.212 --> 42:00.387
Looks like a snail.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.085
This boat is disgusting.

42:03.259 --> 42:05.653
<i>Wait, wait, wait,</i>

42:05.827 --> 42:09.265
-wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, slow down.
-Come on, Izzy. Oh.

42:09.439 --> 42:12.312
Wait, I just need to change
my hand real quick. Go.

42:15.184 --> 42:16.403
Come on.

42:24.585 --> 42:25.586
Whoa!

42:27.022 --> 42:28.023
What?

42:32.027 --> 42:33.028
Dyl, what is it?

43:00.142 --> 43:02.449
Dyl, what are you doing?

43:02.623 --> 43:03.624
Come on, Izzy.

43:23.818 --> 43:24.819
Dyl.

43:28.649 --> 43:29.911
Dyl.

43:32.261 --> 43:33.785
Dyl, don't be stupid.
Just put it down.

43:34.655 --> 43:35.874
Shut up.

43:38.267 --> 43:39.704
What the fuck is this place?

43:47.755 --> 43:48.756
Oi.

43:52.499 --> 43:53.543
That's Tom's.

43:54.370 --> 43:55.415
What a freak.

43:56.590 --> 43:58.940
Camping out here.
Why the fuck would he sleep
outside in the woods?

44:00.594 --> 44:01.769
Probably can't get away
from Mom.

44:06.252 --> 44:09.385
Ooh.
It's like the house of horrors.

44:09.559 --> 44:12.519
That's where he's gonna bury you
after he's killed you.

44:19.178 --> 44:20.396
What? You know what they say.

44:21.789 --> 44:23.922
"Silent one's
are the bloody worst."

44:24.096 --> 44:25.358
Well, Kevin never shut up.

44:40.895 --> 44:41.983
Boo.

44:44.638 --> 44:45.683
I see you found my hideaway.

44:49.251 --> 44:50.252
You're bleeding.

45:13.449 --> 45:14.494
Mom?

45:15.538 --> 45:17.105
Is there a screwdriver
in the caravan?

45:17.715 --> 45:19.368
Uh, yeah, I think I saw
some things under the sink.

45:19.542 --> 45:20.674
Ah.

45:24.896 --> 45:26.898
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.248
Here, it's yours.

45:34.949 --> 45:37.473
I like it, man.

45:37.647 --> 45:39.475
-And this was here?
-Yeah, we found it in the woods.

45:39.649 --> 45:40.650
We had to drag it down here.

45:42.348 --> 45:43.349
Okay.

45:43.915 --> 45:45.264
Alright, let's flip it.

45:56.666 --> 45:58.016
What do you think?

46:00.366 --> 46:01.541
Could we sail it?

46:01.715 --> 46:02.760
It's hardly a yacht.

46:04.152 --> 46:05.327
Doesn't have to be.

46:29.743 --> 46:31.440
Iz, you know,
when Tom got in the car with us,

46:31.614 --> 46:33.747
I know he had that big rucksack.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.793
Did he have another one
with him?

46:37.055 --> 46:38.447
Do you think he's handsome?

46:39.753 --> 46:40.798
What?

46:41.886 --> 46:42.887
Tom.

46:43.931 --> 46:45.106
Do you think he's handsome?

46:47.021 --> 46:48.762
-Dylan loves him.
-Let's focus, Izzy.

46:48.936 --> 46:51.025
A smaller...
black rucksack.

46:51.591 --> 46:52.766
I don't know, Mom.

46:55.116 --> 46:56.117
I'm not sure about him.

46:57.336 --> 46:58.337
Tom? Why?

47:01.601 --> 47:02.776
He's hiding something.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.824
-Aren't we all?
-Stop talking about that,
please.

47:11.611 --> 47:13.482
And I just don't like him
being around, okay?

47:17.182 --> 47:18.792
He might be useful, Iz.

47:21.360 --> 47:24.015
And a bloke around might
make us feel a bit safer.

47:25.712 --> 47:26.844
We are safe,

47:27.409 --> 47:28.410
aren't we?

47:29.977 --> 47:31.022
Yeah.

47:31.979 --> 47:33.763
Yeah. Of course, we are.

47:40.248 --> 47:41.510
I don't want you to bring him
into the caravan.

47:41.684 --> 47:42.729
Oh.

47:43.730 --> 47:44.774
Promise?

47:46.428 --> 47:47.473
Fine.

47:50.606 --> 47:51.651
I promise.

48:02.227 --> 48:04.446
Come on, where you're at, Jo?

48:07.058 --> 48:08.363
Fuck, some people.

48:09.799 --> 48:11.062
Ugh.

48:12.541 --> 48:15.718
"My friend says
I should post this pic."

48:16.545 --> 48:17.546
"Opinions?"

48:19.287 --> 48:20.941
Put some fucking
clothes on, love.

48:24.814 --> 48:25.903
Ugh.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.341
If we done this stuff
back in the day,

48:29.515 --> 48:31.386
-it will be like...
-Like what?

48:31.952 --> 48:34.868
Thinking of kidnapping Milan.
Opinions?

48:36.522 --> 48:37.523
Well, you do this, do you?

48:39.264 --> 48:40.787
Put up pictures of yourself
in your undies

48:40.961 --> 48:41.919
and ask people to comment.

48:42.093 --> 48:43.181
Oh, fuck off.

48:43.355 --> 48:44.660
It's for the kids, innit?

48:44.834 --> 48:45.966
It's... My niece is in that.

48:47.707 --> 48:49.361
Kids?

48:51.624 --> 48:52.755
Or Jo's kids?

48:57.630 --> 48:58.674
Oh, look.

49:00.154 --> 49:01.199
Two days ago.

49:05.507 --> 49:06.508
Get in.

49:24.700 --> 49:25.614
Do you reckon
we could catch a fish?

49:25.788 --> 49:26.789
I don't like fish.

49:28.008 --> 49:29.270
Because I like fish.

49:29.444 --> 49:30.445
It's not all about you.

49:36.060 --> 49:37.235
Please, stop, Dylan.

49:38.062 --> 49:39.324
-Dyl, please stop.
-Who is it gonna tip?

49:39.498 --> 49:40.847
-Who is it gonna tip?
-It's not funny.

49:41.021 --> 49:42.196
-Who is it...?
-It's not funny.

49:47.332 --> 49:48.376
Tom?

49:49.421 --> 49:51.423
- What are you doing?
- You're rocking the boat.

49:52.902 --> 49:53.947
Dyl.

49:54.556 --> 49:55.949
Dyl.

50:00.258 --> 50:01.781
Fucking Tom, Dyl,
he's a nutter.

50:01.955 --> 50:03.217
Shut up, Iz.

50:03.391 --> 50:04.653
What, what's he doing?

50:10.572 --> 50:12.444
Dyl, we need to go.
Like we need to get out of here.

50:53.180 --> 50:54.399
You could do with a wash.

50:55.226 --> 50:56.444
What?

50:59.099 --> 51:00.535
-You need a wash.
-Dyl! Dylan!

51:01.188 --> 51:02.755
What have you done?
He can't swim.

51:05.105 --> 51:06.106
Dyl!

51:08.804 --> 51:09.849
Dyl!

51:25.778 --> 51:26.822
Alright.

51:27.867 --> 51:29.477
Okay. Alright.

51:34.743 --> 51:36.615
Here, grab my hand.
Dylan, grab my hand.

51:37.268 --> 51:38.269
Grab my hand.

51:42.360 --> 51:44.666
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.

51:44.840 --> 51:46.407
I'm okay. I'm okay.

51:52.021 --> 51:53.371
What the hell is wrong with you!

51:54.154 --> 51:55.199
I'm okay.

52:06.775 --> 52:09.082
I didn't realize
you were so religious.

52:10.301 --> 52:11.432
You believe in God, don't you?

52:12.346 --> 52:14.696
Yeah, all of them.

52:15.741 --> 52:16.785
Why?

52:19.571 --> 52:21.529
The way I see it,
God's a win-win.

52:21.703 --> 52:22.748
Win-win?

52:23.531 --> 52:25.316
If there's no happy ever after,

52:26.969 --> 52:28.971
I'll never need to know,
I can still go out smiling.

52:30.451 --> 52:33.106
I don't think Kevin's
gone out smiling, do you?

52:36.283 --> 52:37.415
Were you and him close?

52:38.677 --> 52:39.634
He's me brother, isn't he?

52:40.418 --> 52:41.767
We don't choose family.

52:42.768 --> 52:43.812
Nah.

52:46.119 --> 52:47.642
He's a fucking nutter.

52:50.167 --> 52:53.126
Never knows when
to fucking shut up or slow down.

52:56.434 --> 52:58.131
Had chances though, our Kevin.

52:59.350 --> 53:00.351
Fucking right.

53:02.918 --> 53:04.920
Got a scholarship
at a private school, didn't he?

53:06.705 --> 53:08.402
What? Is that
where he picked up his habit?

53:10.361 --> 53:11.362
Probably.

53:15.496 --> 53:17.629
Yeah, it was
a real fucking chance, that was.

53:20.109 --> 53:21.241
Of course, he wasted it.

53:24.244 --> 53:25.245
More than I ever had.

53:27.813 --> 53:30.207
So, if you know all that,
why are you out to get Jo?

53:31.120 --> 53:32.252
He had a lot of money on him.

53:34.298 --> 53:36.038
She's had it. I want it back.

53:36.865 --> 53:38.258
All of this is about cash?

53:38.432 --> 53:40.042
It's all about fucking cash.

53:42.523 --> 53:44.873
Fucking cost me enough already
these days. Look at that.

53:49.008 --> 53:50.227
Fuck's sake.

54:02.282 --> 54:03.457
It's the right place.

54:04.676 --> 54:06.765
There's a hotel up the road.

54:08.462 --> 54:09.550
Now, we wait there

54:10.116 --> 54:11.857
until one of the kids
sends another message.

54:12.031 --> 54:14.686
Just ring her
and explain what you want.

54:14.860 --> 54:16.035
Yeah,
that's a great idea.

54:17.384 --> 54:18.646
Alright, Jo.

54:19.212 --> 54:20.344
Thanks for killing Kev.

54:21.170 --> 54:22.171
Where are you?

54:23.521 --> 54:24.783
Coming right up for a chat.

54:41.060 --> 54:42.061
What you doing?

54:56.554 --> 54:58.338
I thought you were gonna
drown earlier, too.

54:58.512 --> 54:59.513
Well, I didn't, did I?

55:01.298 --> 55:02.995
Tom is gonna teach me
how to swim anyway.

55:03.648 --> 55:04.692
He's what?

55:05.258 --> 55:06.651
It's not like
I'm scared of the water.

55:07.129 --> 55:08.783
I think
that's a really bad idea.

55:09.654 --> 55:12.352
You should stop bugging him
all the time.

55:12.526 --> 55:14.963
Says you. You can't spend
five minutes on your own.

55:38.639 --> 55:39.727
Do you snore?

55:41.338 --> 55:42.339
No.

55:43.122 --> 55:44.166
I do.

55:53.959 --> 55:54.916
Don't go anywhere.

57:47.551 --> 57:51.032
Everyone with their
fucking heads...

57:51.206 --> 57:54.166
fucking squishes,
stupid, fucking heads off.

57:55.733 --> 57:57.038
I didn't. I didn't. I didn't.

57:57.212 --> 57:59.040
No. No, I did not.

57:59.214 --> 58:01.042
That was a fuckin' movement,
you know?

58:02.261 --> 58:04.089
Don't try to blame me.
Don't you try and blame me.

58:04.263 --> 58:07.048
I swear to fuckin...

58:07.222 --> 58:09.660
All of you trying to fucking
put that blame on me!

58:10.530 --> 58:12.010
I was the only one
who was there.

58:12.184 --> 58:14.926
I was the only one who was there

58:15.100 --> 58:19.104
and you were just watching
and you did nothing to help me.

58:20.453 --> 58:21.889
Judy, fuck off!

59:39.053 --> 59:40.054
Fuck!

01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:03.338
Oh, fuck.

01:00:03.948 --> 01:00:05.210
Give me the key.

01:00:05.384 --> 01:00:06.559
What key?

01:00:06.733 --> 01:00:08.082
The key to the room.

01:00:12.739 --> 01:00:14.349
Okay.

01:00:17.396 --> 01:00:18.702
No.

01:00:18.876 --> 01:00:20.007
What do you mean "no"?

01:00:21.095 --> 01:00:22.183
I ain't giving it to you.

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:26.927
Then I'll kill you.

01:00:30.148 --> 01:00:31.149
Go on then.

01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:37.111
Oh, go on. Seriously, do it.

01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:43.335
I'm so tired.

01:00:47.165 --> 01:00:49.123
Jo never said
nothing about no money.

01:00:54.433 --> 01:00:56.565
Oh, she wouldn't, would she?

01:00:57.479 --> 01:01:00.178
-You need to have
a bit more faith in people.
-Oh, yeah.

01:01:02.354 --> 01:01:05.357
Maybe you need to have
a bit less faith in people.

01:01:10.188 --> 01:01:13.582
I'll tell you
what I do need, Milan.

01:01:18.718 --> 01:01:19.850
More sleep.

01:01:25.812 --> 01:01:27.118
How much do you get...

01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:30.512
on average?

01:01:32.819 --> 01:01:34.516
-Sleep.
-What?

01:01:35.213 --> 01:01:38.129
How much you get
on average a night?

01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:40.914
I get about...

01:01:43.438 --> 01:01:44.701
...about two hours.

01:01:46.615 --> 01:01:47.965
Come downstairs,

01:01:49.314 --> 01:01:50.750
make a cup of tea,

01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:54.232
and I'll talk to the slugs.

01:01:56.582 --> 01:01:57.626
Slugs.

01:02:00.891 --> 01:02:04.721
Got about seven regulars now.

01:02:05.286 --> 01:02:06.331
Regulars.

01:02:08.072 --> 01:02:09.464
Little sods...

01:02:11.423 --> 01:02:13.294
partying on my floor.

01:02:15.993 --> 01:02:17.168
I go back to bed,

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:22.913
come back in the morning,
and no sign of them.

01:02:25.263 --> 01:02:26.568
Does my fucking head in.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:28.222
Oh, then you need to sort it.

01:02:28.396 --> 01:02:29.397
Yeah, I know.

01:02:31.443 --> 01:02:32.966
Got a bloke in, didn't I?

01:02:35.534 --> 01:02:37.318
I don't know what he said
I should do.

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:40.191
Said I should get a duck.

01:02:42.106 --> 01:02:43.150
A duck.

01:02:43.324 --> 01:02:44.499
What? To help you sleep?

01:02:44.673 --> 01:02:48.199
No. To eat
the fucking slugs. Ha.

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:51.028
Jesus.

01:02:52.594 --> 01:02:54.945
You say I should have
more faith in people.

01:02:56.337 --> 01:02:58.078
Alright,
we're gonna stroll in there,

01:02:58.252 --> 01:03:02.735
and she's just going to be
counting out the money for us.

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:05.433
-I don't think so.
-Well, what other choice
has she got?

01:03:18.098 --> 01:03:22.276
What you think? I'm gonna sleep
with a fucking loaded gun,

01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:24.191
stuffed down my pants?

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.542
You dozy fucking mare.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.068
Go to sleep.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:34.941
Go to sleep.

01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:54.439
You alright, hon?

01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:00.575
Why am I in your bed?

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:03.448
You got in with me.

01:04:03.622 --> 01:04:04.710
You funny thing.

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:12.718
Mm-hmm.

01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:15.677
-No, Mom.
-Shh.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.157
I'm just gonna get
some knots out.

01:04:17.766 --> 01:04:19.203
-Yeah, but it hurts.
-Shh.

01:04:19.377 --> 01:04:20.378
Here.

01:04:28.125 --> 01:04:30.649
<i>♪ This is the way</i><i>
We brush our hair ♪</i>

01:04:31.128 --> 01:04:33.870
<i>♪ Brush our hair</i><i>
Brush our hair ♪</i>

01:04:34.044 --> 01:04:35.523
<i>♪ This is the... ♪</i>

01:04:37.003 --> 01:04:38.483
You used to make me sing
that stupid song every day,

01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:39.876
or you wouldn't go to nursery.

01:04:41.138 --> 01:04:42.139
I want to go home.

01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:47.448
It's too soon.

01:04:49.842 --> 01:04:51.626
Ow! Hurts.

01:04:53.237 --> 01:04:54.978
-Ow! Mom, you never listen.
-Oh. Fine.

01:04:55.804 --> 01:04:56.849
Why don't you
get a splash about, yeah?

01:04:57.023 --> 01:04:58.155
Dylan's out there with Tom.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:14.649
- You alright?
- Yeah, this is fine.

01:05:14.823 --> 01:05:16.477
Yeah? You...
Can you touch the bottom?

01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:17.652
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah?

01:05:19.263 --> 01:05:22.657
One, two, three.

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:37.585
Look at you, shower.

01:05:49.597 --> 01:05:50.990
You dick.

01:05:59.868 --> 01:06:00.913
Woo!

01:06:48.656 --> 01:06:49.831
Oi, Mom.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.485
-What?
-Oi, watch this.

01:07:00.538 --> 01:07:01.539
I can swim!

01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:03.280
Woo!

01:07:08.981 --> 01:07:10.026
Come on then.

01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:12.637
Oh, here.

01:07:14.595 --> 01:07:15.596
There you go.

01:07:18.904 --> 01:07:20.210
Didn't you learn that at school?

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.778
No. The year
I was meant to learn,
the council closed the pool.

01:07:23.952 --> 01:07:24.997
Remember?

01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:30.002
Oh, well, who cares?
You can swim now.

01:07:30.176 --> 01:07:31.438
- Hmm.
- Here.

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:33.092
Is one of those for me?

01:07:33.266 --> 01:07:34.267
Oh, yeah.

01:07:36.748 --> 01:07:38.619
- Is it chicken or egg?
- -Well, there wasn't much choice.

01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:40.795
Mm, okay, so.

01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:46.366
Yeah, apparently, some kid
got the shit kicked out of him
outside the village shop.

01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:49.500
Probably 'cause he ordered tuna
so they beat him up.

01:07:49.674 --> 01:07:51.763
No, seriously,
wouldn't expect it around here,

01:07:51.937 --> 01:07:53.373
a sleepy little place like this.

01:07:53.547 --> 01:07:54.983
What wouldn't you expect?

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:56.811
Some young leg got beaten up
in the village.

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:00.032
When was that?

01:08:00.206 --> 01:08:02.861
Uh, we, um, we should row out

01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:05.211
to the sound mirrors.

01:08:07.561 --> 01:08:09.520
-Will it hold all of us?
-Doubt it.

01:08:11.957 --> 01:08:14.307
Don't see why not.
It's not that far.

01:08:18.529 --> 01:08:19.530
That's it.

01:08:21.575 --> 01:08:22.924
Keep us steady.

01:08:23.708 --> 01:08:26.319
Left a bit. Perfect.

01:08:29.627 --> 01:08:30.584
Nice one.

01:08:31.977 --> 01:08:33.326
So, what are these things then?

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:36.024
It's an early warning system

01:08:36.199 --> 01:08:37.461
to pick up the sound
of enemy aircraft.

01:08:37.635 --> 01:08:38.853
How would you know?

01:08:39.027 --> 01:08:40.551
The book
I was reading last night,

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.335
it's got tons of stuff on it.

01:08:42.509 --> 01:08:43.989
- Oh, what? You read now?
- Yeah.

01:08:44.163 --> 01:08:45.947
You should try it sometime.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.384
So, they work then?

01:08:47.949 --> 01:08:49.125
Kind of.

01:08:50.822 --> 01:08:52.258
You could do
with a radar system, Mom.

01:08:53.477 --> 01:08:54.478
What's that?

01:08:55.043 --> 01:08:56.001
Something that warns you

01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:58.046
when a strange man approach.

01:10:10.728 --> 01:10:12.469
I hope you're not keeping
that to yourself.

01:10:27.048 --> 01:10:28.093
Come on.

01:11:06.523 --> 01:11:09.395
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on, Iz.

01:11:10.527 --> 01:11:11.528
Come on.

01:11:12.137 --> 01:11:13.181
Come on.

01:11:14.139 --> 01:11:15.314
Woo-hoo!

01:11:15.488 --> 01:11:16.489
Hello.

01:11:27.021 --> 01:11:28.806
Hello!

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:32.113
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo,
woo-hoo, hello!

01:11:35.987 --> 01:11:37.293
Shut the fuck up.

01:11:38.946 --> 01:11:40.600
Shut the fuck up!

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.125
Shut up!

01:11:59.097 --> 01:12:00.707
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

01:12:00.881 --> 01:12:02.622
Izzy, look at me.
Look at mommy.

01:12:02.796 --> 01:12:04.668
- It's alright.
- It's alright. Okay?

01:12:04.842 --> 01:12:06.670
- It's okay. It's okay.
- It's okay.

01:12:06.844 --> 01:12:08.280
Shhh, shhh.

01:12:08.454 --> 01:12:11.109
Calm down. It's alright.
Shhh, breathe.

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.200
It's alright, it's alright.
it's okay.

01:12:15.374 --> 01:12:17.289
It's okay, it's okay.

01:12:18.203 --> 01:12:19.073
It's alright, baby.

01:12:32.652 --> 01:12:34.262
You got a fucking worm
or something?

01:12:36.613 --> 01:12:38.354
You're a real charmer, Pete.
Do you know that?

01:12:59.636 --> 01:13:00.941
Where's the phone, Milan?

01:13:04.902 --> 01:13:06.817
I don't know.
You must have left it
back at the hotel.

01:13:10.734 --> 01:13:12.388
She messaged you, didn't she?

01:13:13.214 --> 01:13:14.694
What, Jo?

01:13:15.608 --> 01:13:16.609
She's not stupid.

01:13:19.177 --> 01:13:21.092
You fucking liar.

01:13:21.266 --> 01:13:24.704
Argh!

01:13:24.878 --> 01:13:25.923
Fuck!

01:13:33.234 --> 01:13:34.845
Fucking criminal!

01:13:38.152 --> 01:13:39.850
You saw that? Huh?

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.244
You see that?

01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:46.334
Fuck.

01:13:48.859 --> 01:13:51.514
Oh, I'm gonna fucking kill her.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.615
Oh, I know, big boy.

01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:08.095
Yeah, fuck off.

01:14:09.923 --> 01:14:10.924
You fuck.

01:14:19.367 --> 01:14:20.717
You look hot.

01:14:42.956 --> 01:14:44.480
You might as well
let me take a look at that.

01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:22.256
You know, there's no need
for any of this crazy shit.

01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:25.608
We all just need to calm down.

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:53.636
You want some crisps?

01:15:55.986 --> 01:15:57.291
-Going to bed.
-Alright.

01:16:00.817 --> 01:16:01.905
Well, ask Dylan then.

01:16:03.733 --> 01:16:05.343
I'm not taking them into him.

01:16:14.004 --> 01:16:15.048
I'll eat them all.

01:17:29.253 --> 01:17:30.297
Tom!

01:17:36.477 --> 01:17:37.609
Tom, you out here?

01:17:47.445 --> 01:17:48.446
I'm bored shitless.

01:17:50.274 --> 01:17:51.275
Coming in or what?

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.242
Where are you?

01:18:05.506 --> 01:18:06.551
Do you use them...

01:18:08.509 --> 01:18:11.034
Do you use them emojis?

01:18:14.124 --> 01:18:15.125
Do you?

01:18:18.041 --> 01:18:20.304
Neither do I.
Fuck.

01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:23.699
Sent.

01:18:29.922 --> 01:18:31.141
Yeah...

01:18:34.274 --> 01:18:35.885
"In the caravan with Mom."

01:18:37.582 --> 01:18:38.931
"Weirdo's still here."

01:18:42.587 --> 01:18:44.154
"He's dangerous."

01:18:47.679 --> 01:18:49.420
"Scared. Can you come?"

01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:52.031
What the fuck?
Give me the phone.

01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:14.619
<i>
Um, am I a singer?</i>

01:19:15.968 --> 01:19:19.102
No? Okay. Uh...

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.497
Uh... I, I, I had someone famous
played me in a movie.

01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:25.717
-No... Yes.
-Who?

01:19:25.891 --> 01:19:28.764
-Uh, I don't know.
-What?

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:32.593
Well, I can't...
I can't tell them apart.
You can't, can you?

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:35.466
- When they got the little...
- you can't tell who's that, yeah?

01:19:36.032 --> 01:19:39.122
- Oh.
- Yes. Hitler.

01:19:39.862 --> 01:19:43.082
Oh, my God, you are so crap
at this game.

01:19:43.256 --> 01:19:44.867
Yeah, I...

01:19:45.389 --> 01:19:48.000
-Sorry, I, I don't
really do games.
-Mm-hmm.

01:19:48.827 --> 01:19:49.915
Yeah, well, I like games.

01:19:51.743 --> 01:19:55.399
And parties and drinking
on a school night. Woo.

01:19:57.531 --> 01:19:59.533
So, does that make me
a bad person?

01:20:02.841 --> 01:20:07.759
And yes, I have had my share
of gentleman callers.

01:20:07.933 --> 01:20:09.021
I, you know, I...

01:20:09.195 --> 01:20:11.545
I never wanted to be a secretary

01:20:11.719 --> 01:20:14.461
or a, uh, nice wife
or...

01:20:16.768 --> 01:20:17.769
Hmm.

01:20:18.378 --> 01:20:19.815
Not that I thought
I'd end up here

01:20:20.467 --> 01:20:21.904
like this. Jesus.

01:20:26.604 --> 01:20:27.648
Anyway.

01:20:30.608 --> 01:20:32.088
Who are you, Mr. Tom?

01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:37.615
I'm a secretary.

01:20:39.225 --> 01:20:40.139
Seriously?

01:20:44.491 --> 01:20:46.363
What are you doing wandering
around the woods on your own

01:20:46.537 --> 01:20:47.886
like a mad bastard?

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:54.458
Uh, well, I thought
it would do me good.

01:20:55.415 --> 01:20:57.374
To be away from people
for a while.

01:20:57.548 --> 01:20:59.028
Oh, God, that's my idea of hell.

01:21:01.334 --> 01:21:04.120
Well, I've spent years
being part of a group.

01:21:05.904 --> 01:21:11.344
Eating together,
sleeping together,
shitting together, everything.

01:21:14.608 --> 01:21:15.609
You've been inside then?

01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:22.965
Afghanistan.

01:21:26.316 --> 01:21:27.317
Oh.

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:33.279
So how come
you don't see your kid?

01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:41.984
I came home different.

01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:45.117
Couldn't get my shit together.

01:21:45.291 --> 01:21:46.510
Well...

01:21:48.599 --> 01:21:50.079
that bit sounds familiar.

01:22:15.104 --> 01:22:16.801
-The kids. The kids.
-Oh, sorry.

01:22:56.841 --> 01:22:58.451
<i>
So, do you have</i><i>
any battle scars?</i>

01:23:01.933 --> 01:23:03.848
Not ones that you can see. No.

01:23:06.329 --> 01:23:07.330
I hear things,

01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:10.768
see things that aren't there,

01:23:13.162 --> 01:23:14.163
and I react.

01:23:18.254 --> 01:23:19.646
I had a friend who saw a shrink

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:21.474
because she couldn't stop
shagging people at work.

01:23:23.911 --> 01:23:27.263
So there's people you can talk
to about real serious shit.

01:23:31.832 --> 01:23:33.095
I have tried, but...

01:23:35.097 --> 01:23:38.056
they just want you to revisit
old stuff all the time, and...

01:23:39.623 --> 01:23:40.972
I can't.

01:23:44.541 --> 01:23:46.804
Well, just because
you're paranoid, doesn't mean
they're not out to get you.

01:23:49.807 --> 01:23:51.026
Sorry. It's not helpful.

01:23:53.985 --> 01:23:55.160
Is that what Izzy thinks?

01:23:57.293 --> 01:23:58.294
Izzy?

01:23:59.425 --> 01:24:00.426
Yeah.

01:24:01.819 --> 01:24:03.473
She's on her guard,
that's for sure.

01:24:08.782 --> 01:24:10.045
I don't wanna talk about Izzy.

01:25:17.024 --> 01:25:18.156
You think I'm the mentalist?

01:25:19.592 --> 01:25:20.593
What time is it?

01:25:21.942 --> 01:25:23.335
Go look in Mom's room.

01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:31.126
Oh, my God! Dylan, get out.
Get out of my room!

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.344
Get out! Get out!

01:25:32.518 --> 01:25:34.303
She always does this.

01:25:35.173 --> 01:25:36.305
You ain't special, you know.

01:25:36.479 --> 01:25:37.480
Don't be so fucking rude!

01:25:37.654 --> 01:25:39.525
- Go on. Go!
- No.

01:25:39.699 --> 01:25:40.874
You do that every time.

01:25:41.048 --> 01:25:42.485
Every time,
you doing this thing.

01:25:42.659 --> 01:25:44.139
Every time!

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:55.585
She probably
only wanted your money.

01:25:55.759 --> 01:25:57.804
My money?

01:25:58.283 --> 01:25:59.328
You know, the rucksack.

01:25:59.806 --> 01:26:01.373
I killed her last boyfriend.

01:26:01.547 --> 01:26:02.940
Didn't she tell you that?

01:26:05.072 --> 01:26:06.465
I've called for help. Just go!

01:26:24.875 --> 01:26:25.919
Pete's here.

01:26:27.269 --> 01:26:28.400
Pete's here.

01:26:28.574 --> 01:26:31.360
Oh, my God. Dylan, come.

01:26:31.534 --> 01:26:32.839
Dylan, come here now.

01:26:34.319 --> 01:26:35.581
Oh, my God.

01:26:49.465 --> 01:26:50.466
Jo.

01:26:53.991 --> 01:26:55.993
Jo, open the door, will you?

01:26:57.429 --> 01:26:59.475
- What are you gonna do to us?
- Nothing.

01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:02.913
Nothing.
I ain't gonna hurt you, nothing.

01:27:07.047 --> 01:27:10.225
Jo, he's not here
to hurt anyone.

01:27:10.964 --> 01:27:11.922
Milan?

01:27:12.096 --> 01:27:13.489
Yeah, it's me.

01:27:13.663 --> 01:27:15.795
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:27:18.581 --> 01:27:20.974
How did he find us?

01:27:21.932 --> 01:27:23.020
It was me.

01:27:23.673 --> 01:27:25.370
I told you
not to talk to anyone.

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:28.547
I thought I told you not to let
Tom into the caravan.

01:27:29.505 --> 01:27:31.158
- What?
- -You opening the door, or what?

01:27:32.508 --> 01:27:34.031
- You won't hurt us?
- No.

01:27:34.205 --> 01:27:35.989
He just wants the money, Jo.

01:27:38.122 --> 01:27:39.906
Open the fucking door!

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.952
Alright. Alright.
We're coming out.

01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:54.878
You alright, Pete?

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:11.460
Where is it?

01:28:13.331 --> 01:28:14.854
-The, the rucksack
with the money?
-Yes.

01:28:15.028 --> 01:28:16.552
-Is, is that your money?
-Yes.

01:28:16.726 --> 01:28:18.641
Ah, yeah,
there was, there was a bag,

01:28:18.815 --> 01:28:20.077
but I thought it was Tom's.

01:28:20.251 --> 01:28:21.861
It's Kevin and Pete's money.

01:28:22.035 --> 01:28:23.863
It wasn't back at the flat.
You must have it, Jo.

01:28:24.037 --> 01:28:25.604
No, there isn't
any money, Milan.

01:28:25.778 --> 01:28:29.042
You! You're full
of shit. Fuck.

01:28:29.216 --> 01:28:30.740
Let's just
find the bag, alright?

01:28:31.741 --> 01:28:33.395
- Have you got it, Jo?
- Yeah.

01:28:34.352 --> 01:28:36.223
Yeah, there's a bag in the,
in the boot of the car.

01:28:36.398 --> 01:28:38.617
Dylan, it's the rucksack
in the boot. It's open. Go on.

01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:47.583
It's okay. You're alright.

01:28:47.757 --> 01:28:50.760
You're alright. It's alright.
It's okay.

01:28:53.937 --> 01:28:55.112
Where is it, Dylan?

01:28:56.418 --> 01:28:57.897
I don't know
what anyone's on about.

01:28:59.551 --> 01:29:00.552
Oi, you.

01:29:01.597 --> 01:29:03.033
Instagram, come here.

01:29:03.207 --> 01:29:05.122
- Izzy, don't you move.
- Come here.

01:29:05.296 --> 01:29:07.298
No. No.

01:29:07.472 --> 01:29:09.082
Come here!

01:29:11.041 --> 01:29:12.172
Here.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.478
Oh, my God.

01:29:15.915 --> 01:29:17.177
Pete, please.

01:29:19.136 --> 01:29:20.311
Pete, please.

01:29:23.836 --> 01:29:24.750
The bag.

01:29:24.924 --> 01:29:26.186
Have you got it?

01:29:28.624 --> 01:29:29.625
No?

01:29:30.887 --> 01:29:31.888
Ain't got it?

01:29:33.498 --> 01:29:34.586
Alright.

01:29:35.195 --> 01:29:36.762
You find our fucking money,

01:29:36.936 --> 01:29:39.069
or I will cut off
her fucking ears.

01:29:39.243 --> 01:29:40.723
Do you understand?

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:43.813
- It was in the car, I promise you!
- -Do you understand?

01:29:43.987 --> 01:29:46.119
-Pete, she'd tell you
if she knew anything.
-Please.

01:29:49.862 --> 01:29:51.951
Alright. It's alright.
It's alright. Come. Come.

01:29:53.997 --> 01:29:57.261
Fuck.

01:30:00.482 --> 01:30:02.919
Fuck. Fuck.

01:30:04.007 --> 01:30:05.095
Did you take it?

01:30:07.097 --> 01:30:08.664
He would have fucking killed us.

01:30:11.710 --> 01:30:14.452
Now, just give him the money
and both of you just go.

01:30:23.809 --> 01:30:24.810
Fuck.

01:30:47.311 --> 01:30:49.139
You should be giving Jo
some of that damn money

01:30:49.313 --> 01:30:50.749
after what you and your brother
put her through.

01:30:50.923 --> 01:30:52.490
Ah, fuck.

01:30:53.535 --> 01:30:55.014
She killed my brother.

01:30:55.188 --> 01:30:56.799
Oh, he fucking deserved it.

01:30:56.973 --> 01:30:59.410
I killed him.

01:31:02.805 --> 01:31:04.197
He was hurting Mom again

01:31:05.764 --> 01:31:07.026
like he used to hurt me.

01:31:43.236 --> 01:31:46.152
Fuckin'... We don't want
your fucking money.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:50.287
You keep your fucking money.

01:31:52.028 --> 01:31:52.985
Fuck.

01:31:59.601 --> 01:32:00.602
Fuck.

01:33:47.970 --> 01:33:51.408
What?
What are you thinking?

01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:57.066
You're only as sick
as your secrets.

01:34:04.551 --> 01:34:05.770
It's over now.

01:34:08.555 --> 01:34:09.600
Is it?

01:34:13.909 --> 01:34:19.131
I have been so careless
with them.

01:35:06.570 --> 01:35:07.745
Mom, stop.
