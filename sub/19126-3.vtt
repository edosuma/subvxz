00:01.710 --> 00:04.889
Hey, this is joel collins. I met a nurse
named annie. How did you get this number?

00:04.913 --> 00:06.480
She said you could help me.

00:06.515 --> 00:08.582
I believe we should be in
control of our life.

00:08.617 --> 00:12.052
And our death. That's liberty.

00:12.087 --> 00:13.553
And dying isn't a crime.

00:13.589 --> 00:16.123
No, but helping people die
makes you a criminal.

00:16.158 --> 00:17.691
<i>My god. You had sex with him.</i>

00:17.726 --> 00:18.770
And now you think you two are
gonna live.

00:18.794 --> 00:20.994
Happily ever after. He's dying.

00:21.030 --> 00:22.095
Can you tell me again?

00:22.131 --> 00:23.964
You told me how they do it in
switzerland,

00:23.999 --> 00:26.800
But I really want to hear how
you're gonna do it.

00:26.835 --> 00:29.169
Des, he's a cop.
I almost killed him.

00:29.204 --> 00:31.004
Get out now.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.540
She's by her car,
can't see what she's doing.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.475
Please don't go. Augh!

00:36.679 --> 00:38.045
God, des, say something!

00:38.080 --> 00:40.013
I really think
we need to help charlie.

00:40.049 --> 00:44.985
Sid, would you get dr. Mary
harris of 228 maple drive.

00:45.020 --> 00:46.453
What she came here for tonight?

00:46.488 --> 00:47.821
Smile.

00:47.856 --> 00:49.222
You sound like your mom.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.158
<i>I told her I took her drugs
from the shed,</i>

00:51.193 --> 00:53.393
<i>And she said
she wouldn't tell anyone.</i>

00:53.429 --> 00:55.228
If I cleaned up my act.

00:55.264 --> 00:56.264
Wait. She knew about it?

00:56.298 --> 00:59.399
I, troy dixon,
choose to take my life.

00:59.435 --> 01:02.769
I think you might know
my husband, troy dixon.

01:02.805 --> 01:05.205
You don't get to play god, mary.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.240
None of us do.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.275
You got the wrong girl.

01:08.310 --> 01:09.409
<i>Listen to me.</i>

01:09.445 --> 01:12.312
Right now,
they don't have anything on us.

01:12.347 --> 01:14.648
So we just need to be smarter.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:03.565 --> 02:06.099
I thought death always knocked
three times.

02:06.135 --> 02:10.303
Guess you're safe... For now.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.139
Larissa? Still asleep.

02:12.174 --> 02:14.007
God, she sleeps like a teenager.

02:14.042 --> 02:15.308
She is a teenager.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.177
Yeah.

02:17.212 --> 02:18.945
It's for after irene,

02:18.981 --> 02:21.248
Assuming we don't end up in
jail.

02:21.283 --> 02:22.482
New patient, new phone.

02:22.518 --> 02:25.352
Smarter.

02:25.387 --> 02:27.521
You know, I was thinking about
irene.

02:27.556 --> 02:30.924
If my family had the gene,
I'd want to know.

02:30.959 --> 02:32.425
I say wait for the symptoms.

02:32.461 --> 02:35.228
Yeah, in the meantime, eat,
shag, and be merry.

02:35.264 --> 02:36.574
Wouldn't you want to know
what kind of future.

02:36.598 --> 02:38.098
You're facing? God no.

02:38.133 --> 02:39.332
No, ignorance is bliss.

02:40.536 --> 02:41.902
So early.

02:41.937 --> 02:43.904
Morning, sleepy.
There's coffee in the kitchen.

02:43.939 --> 02:45.038
We're off. Okay.

02:45.073 --> 02:47.641
Keys? They're on the table.

02:48.877 --> 02:49.910
Good luck.

02:52.314 --> 02:55.816
So domestic.

03:04.159 --> 03:05.559
Hey, here she is.

03:05.594 --> 03:09.563
She's leaving.

03:17.206 --> 03:18.638
Don't get your hopes up.

03:18.674 --> 03:21.107
She hasn't killed anyone in over
a week, right?

03:21.143 --> 03:25.879
Must've been so hard for her.

03:32.821 --> 03:37.424
All right, mary, where are you
taking us?

03:44.266 --> 03:46.700
Yeah, that's the same nursing
home surveillance saw her.

03:46.735 --> 03:49.603
Going through a few days ago.

03:49.638 --> 03:51.071
She visit anyone?

03:52.507 --> 03:55.175
Yeah, visitor's log says 103.

03:59.414 --> 04:01.781
It's on the left.

04:01.817 --> 04:04.417
Right here. Right here.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.019
"Exposing her milky white..."

04:07.122 --> 04:08.521
Can I help you?

04:08.557 --> 04:10.023
What's happening, larissa?

04:10.058 --> 04:11.736
I don't know, grandma.
I'm detective gaines.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.393
This is my partner, detective
wesley.

04:13.428 --> 04:14.728
You can't just barge in here.

04:14.763 --> 04:16.440
You could've given my
grandma another stroke.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.865
Apologies, but we're looking
for dr. Mary harris.

04:18.901 --> 04:20.466
We have reason to believe she's
here.

04:20.502 --> 04:22.869
No, mary lent me her car to
visit my grandmother.

04:22.905 --> 04:24.504
She hardly ever comes to visit.

04:24.539 --> 04:26.306
I have to wait forever between
chapters.

04:26.341 --> 04:27.986
Yeah, because I don't have a
car, grandma; I told you that.

04:28.010 --> 04:30.477
Okay, do you know where mary
is right now?

04:30.512 --> 04:32.078
No, I barely even know her.

04:32.114 --> 04:33.524
I mean, I, like, try to be
friends with her,

04:33.548 --> 04:35.782
But she's aloof, like a cat.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.019
That's why it was weird that she
lent me her car, but, you know,

04:39.054 --> 04:40.086
People can surprise you.

04:40.122 --> 04:41.755
So can cats.

04:41.790 --> 04:43.623
So you have no idea where she
is?

04:43.659 --> 04:45.892
She left with my
boyfriend des this morning.

04:45.928 --> 04:48.295
But I don't know
where they went.

04:52.701 --> 04:56.336
Are they in some kind of
trouble?

05:11.386 --> 05:13.720
Hi.

05:13.755 --> 05:15.855
We started early.

05:15.891 --> 05:17.924
I hope you don't mind.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.025
Not at all, no.

05:19.061 --> 05:21.328
Day drinking is a highly
respected pastime.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.263
Where I come from.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.734
How are you feeling, irene?

05:27.769 --> 05:30.971
I woke up this morning.

05:31.006 --> 05:34.874
Feeling incredibly peaceful.

05:34.910 --> 05:38.378
Said she hasn't felt this way
since our wedding day.

05:38.413 --> 05:41.381
Is that a compliment?

05:41.416 --> 05:44.384
People always talk about
jitters,

05:44.419 --> 05:48.154
But I never had any of that.

05:48.190 --> 05:51.024
On my wedding day,

05:51.059 --> 05:54.761
I felt absolutely certain.

05:54.796 --> 05:57.530
We were making the right
decision.

05:57.566 --> 06:01.968
To spend our lives together.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.050
You look beautiful, irene.

06:50.085 --> 06:53.753
Well, you never know who
you're going to see.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.989
On the other side.

07:01.763 --> 07:05.732
I know what I want my last words
to be.

07:05.767 --> 07:07.534
Are we ready?

07:09.004 --> 07:11.538
We are.

07:16.378 --> 07:20.113
There is beauty in the
inevitable.

07:40.035 --> 07:42.368
This car smells like cherries.

07:42.404 --> 07:43.436
Can we keep it?

07:43.472 --> 07:45.872
No, honey. It's a rental.

07:45.907 --> 07:47.474
Hi, dr. Harris.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.608
Hi, naomi.

07:48.643 --> 07:49.954
My mom just wanted to say
thank you.

07:49.978 --> 07:52.879
For letting me stay
over this weekend.

07:52.914 --> 07:55.215
No problem.

07:56.818 --> 07:58.251
Sweet ride.

07:58.286 --> 08:01.121
It's a rental.

08:01.156 --> 08:02.322
So what are they doing?

08:02.357 --> 08:04.657
Are they going on a
trip or something?

08:04.693 --> 08:06.025
No. My mom's just, like,

08:06.061 --> 08:08.139
Obsessed with design shows,
so she's helping kevin...

08:08.163 --> 08:10.130
We got to go get educated.

08:10.165 --> 08:12.265
Have a nice day.
My mom is such a liar, okay?

08:12.300 --> 08:13.399
We're skipping school.

08:15.137 --> 08:17.871
Wait. I wrote a poem.

08:17.906 --> 08:19.266
Can I read it?
Yeah, let's hear it.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.911
"The spark turned cold,
a darkness bright.

08:24.946 --> 08:27.914
"You had no voice,
we had no choice.

08:27.949 --> 08:29.983
A ghost in my heart."

08:30.018 --> 08:31.484
It's about casper.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.852
Do you like it?

08:35.222 --> 08:37.524
Cambie, it's really good.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.460
Thanks.

08:48.904 --> 08:50.470
I'll see you after school, okay?

08:50.505 --> 08:51.571
Okay.

08:51.606 --> 08:54.607
Have a nice day.

09:07.289 --> 09:09.355
<i>Hello? - Hi, ben. It's mary.</i>

09:09.391 --> 09:10.990
I need to talk to you.

09:12.060 --> 09:13.226
<i>But not here.</i>

09:27.576 --> 09:29.609
You look well.

09:29.644 --> 09:31.255
You know, I've had about all
the games I can take.

09:31.279 --> 09:35.081
For one morning, mary,
so what do you want?

09:35.116 --> 09:37.550
I need your advice.

09:37.586 --> 09:41.421
Everywhere I go lately,
I feel like I'm being watched.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.557
So I've thinking, maybe I have a
stalker.

09:44.593 --> 09:46.726
Maybe he's dangerous.

09:46.761 --> 09:48.294
Should I file a police report?

09:48.330 --> 09:49.796
Yeah, you should.

09:49.831 --> 09:52.432
I can have officers
at your home, at the hospital.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.768
Anywhere you go, the cops will
be right there.

10:00.208 --> 10:03.876
Why can't you just accept that
you were wrong about me,

10:03.912 --> 10:06.679
That I'm just a doctor who
sometimes volunteers.

10:06.715 --> 10:09.115
With the terminally ill and that
you're just a cop.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.351
With a bad lead?

10:11.386 --> 10:14.220
And we just ride off into the
sunset.

10:14.256 --> 10:16.723
Or maybe get a drink?

10:19.461 --> 10:21.761
A week ago, you were ready to
give me.

10:21.796 --> 10:24.998
Some kind of eternal cocktail.

10:25.033 --> 10:26.410
If you hadn't figured out I was
a cop,

10:26.434 --> 10:28.001
You'd be in jail right now.

10:28.036 --> 10:30.336
Or maybe I'd be talking to my
lawyer about how the cop.

10:30.372 --> 10:31.682
Who was supposed
to be investigating me.

10:31.706 --> 10:33.072
Had sex with me instead.

10:33.108 --> 10:35.041
I can live with that. I can.

10:35.076 --> 10:36.643
But can you live
with what you've done?

10:36.678 --> 10:38.578
I haven't done anything.

10:38.613 --> 10:42.749
My only crime was to feel sorry
for a desperate, dying man.

10:42.784 --> 10:44.884
Do you feel sorry for all of
your patients, mary,

10:44.919 --> 10:46.486
Or was I special?

10:49.924 --> 10:52.258
You were the one that got away.

10:54.896 --> 10:57.730
What messed you up, mary?

10:59.234 --> 11:01.234
What? What messed you up?

11:01.269 --> 11:02.902
You think you're above the law.

11:02.937 --> 11:04.837
You're risking your life, your
daughter's life.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.206
What messed you up?

11:07.242 --> 11:11.110
You deceive people for a living.

11:11.146 --> 11:13.946
Ben... is that still your name?

11:16.051 --> 11:18.251
You do what you want,

11:18.286 --> 11:19.497
But I think it's in your best
interest.

11:19.521 --> 11:20.653
If this case goes away.

11:37.372 --> 11:39.205
<i>I was awake all night.</i>

11:39.240 --> 11:42.342
Worrying about irene,
about everything.

11:42.377 --> 11:44.811
It was perfect.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.114
No cops this time?

11:48.149 --> 11:51.951
Would I be handing you this
envelope if there were?

11:51.986 --> 11:54.520
I told you, the cops
don't have anything on us,

11:54.556 --> 11:59.192
And I know how to stay ahead of
them.

11:59.227 --> 12:01.005
But, annie, I don't want you
lying awake all night.

12:01.029 --> 12:04.230
If you can't do
this anymore, I get it.

12:11.406 --> 12:13.106
Morgan lewis.

12:13.141 --> 12:15.041
Cystic fibrosis.

12:17.011 --> 12:18.978
33. He's young.

12:19.013 --> 12:20.580
Well, I've been treating him
for years.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.715
He was in here last week.
He said that he feels like.

12:22.751 --> 12:25.785
He's drowning in slow motion.

12:25.820 --> 12:28.020
He's ready.

12:29.758 --> 12:32.225
You know I started carrying
my passport around?

12:32.260 --> 12:35.328
Just in case.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.896
Where would you go?

12:36.931 --> 12:39.832
China, I guess.

12:39.868 --> 12:41.567
The devil you know, right?

12:46.474 --> 12:48.241
Are we crazy?

12:49.677 --> 12:51.377
Yep.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.585
We need a new plan.

12:59.621 --> 13:01.087
She'll slip up. They always do.

13:01.122 --> 13:02.321
No, man, she's different.

13:02.357 --> 13:04.023
She's smart. She's careful.

13:04.058 --> 13:06.025
She knows what to say,
what not to say,

13:06.060 --> 13:07.338
The whole counseling cover
story.

13:07.362 --> 13:08.761
Yeah, you're right.

13:08.797 --> 13:11.264
There's no way that joel was her
only patient after ethan.

13:11.299 --> 13:13.266
No, no way.
There's got to be more.

13:13.301 --> 13:14.534
I have an idea.

13:14.569 --> 13:17.270
Let's run through our
sudden-death reports,

13:17.305 --> 13:20.072
See if any connect back to eden
general.

13:20.108 --> 13:22.241
Okay.

13:26.714 --> 13:28.354
<i>I still don't understand how
you got this.</i>

13:29.651 --> 13:31.851
You said you work with
kids, but then you hardly ever.

13:31.886 --> 13:33.453
Leave the apartment, except with
mary.

13:33.488 --> 13:39.425
And then the shoulder,
the cops...

13:39.461 --> 13:40.771
If we're gonna be in a
relationship,

13:40.795 --> 13:46.065
I think you should
be honest with me.

13:46.100 --> 13:49.535
Okay.

13:49.571 --> 13:52.538
Okay, listen,

13:52.574 --> 13:56.342
Truth is, I don't work
with kids.

13:56.377 --> 14:00.012
Mary and I are
end-of-life counselors.

14:00.048 --> 14:02.048
We... we help people who are
dying.

14:02.083 --> 14:05.852
We talk to them,
show them their options.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.987
Dark.

14:08.022 --> 14:10.056
Yeah. Yeah, it is, sure,

14:10.091 --> 14:13.392
But that's why I didn't tell you
about it in the first place.

14:13.428 --> 14:16.462
But you know what?
Now that we're talking about it,

14:16.498 --> 14:19.765
We're thinking about
opening up our own practice,

14:19.801 --> 14:23.703
A haven
for the hopeless, if you will.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.305
That is so great, des.

14:26.341 --> 14:27.618
It's like with my grandma,
you know?

14:27.642 --> 14:29.675
Sometimes all she wants is some
company.

14:36.317 --> 14:38.117
Sharing is so hot.

14:38.152 --> 14:39.385
Yes, it is.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.089
<i>What do we have?</i>

14:43.124 --> 14:46.025
Sid thomas-haye, gunshot wound
to the upper thigh.

14:46.060 --> 14:47.171
Looks like a
through-and-through injury.

14:47.195 --> 14:48.227
Vitals are stable.

14:48.263 --> 14:51.731
Start an iv. Run normal saline.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.244
Officers.
This patient's in our custody.

14:53.268 --> 14:54.567
Yeah, I got that. What happened?

14:54.602 --> 14:56.469
Caught him in a shoot-out in
south warren.

14:56.504 --> 15:00.373
Had some drugs on him, so he's
looking at five years.

15:00.408 --> 15:01.741
Look, I get you have a job to
do,

15:01.776 --> 15:02.786
But can you give us a bit of
space?

15:02.810 --> 15:04.477
All right, sorry.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.990
Relax your eyes.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.997
I know you.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.832
Let's get a mask on him.
I know you.

15:28.736 --> 15:30.503
Put your head down.
Breathe deeply.

15:33.541 --> 15:36.542
Okay, get an x-ray to make sure
there's no bone damage,

15:36.578 --> 15:39.378
5 milligrams of morphine,
and draw blood work.

15:39.414 --> 15:40.880
Got it.

15:49.532 --> 15:50.865
[M beeps]

15:50.900 --> 15:52.767
<i>Dr. Harris to icu.</i>

15:52.802 --> 15:54.502
<i>Dr. Harris to icu.</i>

15:54.537 --> 15:56.303
What about the risks?

15:56.339 --> 15:57.972
Well, sure, it's another
operation,

15:58.007 --> 16:00.241
So there's always a possibility
of complications.

16:00.276 --> 16:02.076
Organ damage, stroke, death.

16:02.111 --> 16:03.711
Someone's been googling?

16:03.746 --> 16:06.881
Matt, you just have to have
faith that dr. Taylor's.

16:06.916 --> 16:08.849
Gonna bring you through this.
Right, doctor?

16:08.885 --> 16:10.985
Hi, sonia. Matt.

16:11.020 --> 16:12.164
Matt's gonna have his surgery
tomorrow.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.355
For one second can we talk
about a complication.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.290
And I end up in a coma or...

16:16.325 --> 16:17.958
Or breathing through a tube or
something.

16:17.994 --> 16:19.093
I don't want that.

16:19.128 --> 16:21.295
Well, that's very, very
unlikely.

16:21.330 --> 16:23.898
But it's possible, right?

16:26.702 --> 16:28.969
Yes, it is possible.

16:29.005 --> 16:31.806
And it's normal to be playing
out worst-case scenarios.

16:31.841 --> 16:33.607
In times like this.

16:33.643 --> 16:36.610
But I assure you you've got the
best doctor in the city.

16:36.646 --> 16:38.279
You're in great hands.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.983
My goodness.

16:43.019 --> 16:44.852
Matt. What's going on?

16:44.887 --> 16:46.020
Matt? Matt.

16:46.055 --> 16:47.299
The wound in the heart has
reopened.

16:47.323 --> 16:48.634
Let's get him to the o.R.
Stay with me.

16:48.658 --> 16:52.660
We are gonna take matt down to
surgery right now.

16:52.695 --> 16:54.428
Matt. Let's go. Let's go.

16:54.463 --> 16:55.863
Find out what o.R. Is open.

16:55.898 --> 16:57.932
Don't you worry. We're gonna
take good care of him.

16:57.967 --> 17:01.135
Let's go. Let's move it.

17:07.676 --> 17:10.243
These are depressing the
out of me.

17:10.279 --> 17:14.048
Yeah, it's like some morbid
game of "where's waldo?"

17:17.118 --> 17:20.287
There are a lot of suicides.

17:20.323 --> 17:23.089
Yeah, this woman starved
herself to death.

17:23.125 --> 17:27.560
53, severe stroke, paralyzed,
except for one hand,

17:27.597 --> 17:31.065
Which she used to pull the
feeding tube out every time.

17:31.100 --> 17:32.666
Her care worker put it in.

17:32.702 --> 17:34.768
Care worker's only doing her
job, man.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.582
Yeah, I know, but, I mean,
I'm just saying, you know,

17:36.606 --> 17:39.440
Who has the right to decide when
it's your time to go?

17:39.475 --> 17:41.041
Certainly not mary.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.978
Yeah.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.448
Troy dixon.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.050
Why do I know that name?

17:50.086 --> 17:52.253
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

18:00.062 --> 18:02.296
Okay, watch your back.
We're coming through.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.564
Thank god.

18:03.599 --> 18:05.344
He's been whining for a doctor
for a half hour.

18:05.368 --> 18:06.433
Busy day.

18:06.469 --> 18:09.670
How soon do you think he can
be discharged?

18:09.705 --> 18:11.038
Probably tomorrow morning.

18:11.073 --> 18:13.073
If we can keep him alive until
then.

18:13.109 --> 18:14.508
We have to.

18:14.543 --> 18:17.511
Then we get him tied to his
shooter, and we're golden.

18:19.548 --> 18:24.118
Doc, I got a bad feeling.

18:24.153 --> 18:25.452
In my chest,

18:25.488 --> 18:28.822
And my heart is beating really
fast.

18:28.858 --> 18:32.593
Kay, let me listen.

18:40.770 --> 18:43.504
That feeling in your chest,
it's anxiety,

18:43.539 --> 18:45.272
Pretty common after something
like this.

18:45.308 --> 18:48.409
Maybe you should do some more
tests.

18:48.444 --> 18:50.911
We already have.
Your x-rays show no.

18:50.947 --> 18:52.513
Bullet fragments or bone damage.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.349
I think maybe I should stay
here.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.684
You're fine.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.086
You'll be able to limp out of
here tomorrow.

18:59.121 --> 19:01.288
Great.

19:01.324 --> 19:03.924
You ever see a dead man walking?

19:12.401 --> 19:13.801
Try to get some rest, okay?

19:13.836 --> 19:16.036
You've been through a lot.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.974
Hey, I figured it out.

19:20.009 --> 19:23.577
You came by grady's place last
week.

19:23.612 --> 19:26.380
You bought a ton of barbs.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.717
Mouse ears.

19:29.752 --> 19:34.455
No, that wasn't me.

19:34.490 --> 19:35.789
Troy dixon, the football player?

19:35.825 --> 19:36.857
Yeah, I remember him.

19:36.892 --> 19:38.692
We don't often get celebrities.

19:38.728 --> 19:40.160
Pancreatic cancer.

19:40.196 --> 19:42.129
It's an ugly disease,
a real dog.

19:42.164 --> 19:44.343
Yeah, I'm sure. Look, it says
I in your coroner's report.

19:44.367 --> 19:45.632
That he had bloodshot eyes.

19:45.668 --> 19:48.068
Yeah, you often see blood
around the irises.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.548
When a patient's
struggling to breath.

19:49.572 --> 19:54.041
Okay, but that can also be a
sign of overdose, right?

19:54.076 --> 19:56.076
What are you implying,
detective?

19:56.112 --> 19:58.779
Well, I'm... i'm just saying I
can see why someone in troy's.

19:58.814 --> 20:00.359
Case may want to check out a
little early.

20:00.383 --> 20:01.593
And I'm trying to rule out
whether he had.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.083
A little help or not.

20:03.119 --> 20:06.954
Well, that's my job, and
I did rule it out.

20:06.989 --> 20:10.424
Troy dixon was in the late
stages of a terminal disease.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.959
His wife confirmed that his
breathing.

20:11.994 --> 20:13.494
Had been labored that day,

20:13.529 --> 20:16.263
And I concluded it was natural
causes.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.132
And you're absolutely sure?

20:18.167 --> 20:19.933
We have a saying in my line of
work.

20:19.969 --> 20:23.570
"If you hear hoofbeats,
think horse, not zebra."

20:38.487 --> 20:39.720
Relax.

20:39.755 --> 20:41.989
I told them I was your brother.

20:42.024 --> 20:43.223
I don't have a brother.

20:43.259 --> 20:44.436
Couldn't tell them I was here
to see sid,

20:44.460 --> 20:47.628
Not with all these police
around.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.597
You know, I never should have
sent him into south warren.

20:50.633 --> 20:52.766
I saw this opportunity to expand
my business,

20:52.802 --> 20:56.036
And I thought he could handle
it.

20:56.072 --> 20:58.272
This is my fault.
He's gonna be okay.

20:58.307 --> 21:00.340
We're just waiting on a few more
tests.

21:01.811 --> 21:05.212
I need you to be straight with
me, mary.

21:05.247 --> 21:07.381
But I don't give a about this.

21:07.416 --> 21:08.916
Patient-doctor confidentiality.

21:08.951 --> 21:11.452
You tell me the truth.

21:11.487 --> 21:13.053
Really, he's gonna be fine.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.725
All right.

21:18.761 --> 21:19.793
Thank you.

21:23.099 --> 21:24.465
Thank you.

21:24.500 --> 21:28.202
I'm just doing my job.

21:28.237 --> 21:30.337
You know, the police think
they're heroes.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.606
Going after a guy like sid.

21:32.641 --> 21:33.919
But they don't want to do
anything about the beast.

21:33.943 --> 21:38.612
That's inside the addict
demanding to be fed.

21:38.647 --> 21:40.147
They just want to pull away the
plate.

21:40.182 --> 21:41.915
I really have to get back to
work now.

21:45.788 --> 21:46.920
I need you to get sid out.

21:49.425 --> 21:52.793
Either the guy that runs south
warren is gonna finish the job,

21:52.828 --> 21:55.329
Or the police are gonna lock him
up.

21:55.364 --> 21:58.599
And this is on me, and I need to
protect him.

21:58.634 --> 22:00.701
That's not my problem.

22:05.007 --> 22:07.674
I think you're gonna do what I'm
asking you, mary.

22:07.710 --> 22:09.676
I'm not helping you.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.485
Only when cornered.

22:26.521 --> 22:28.032
I turned around,
and he was right there.

22:28.056 --> 22:29.288
I can't just ignore him.

22:29.324 --> 22:30.656
Yes, you can. You have to.

22:30.692 --> 22:33.893
He has on us, on me.

22:33.928 --> 22:36.495
We don't know if he's gonna use
it to get what he wants.

22:36.531 --> 22:39.098
Grady can't expose you without
exposing himself.

22:39.133 --> 22:41.367
He won't risk it.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.135
We need a new supplier.
Great idea.

22:43.171 --> 22:45.204
I'll put an ad in the paper.
Des, I'm serious.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.906
I don't need another reason to
be looking.

22:46.941 --> 22:48.240
Over my shoulder right now.

22:48.276 --> 22:50.020
Okay, look, we have enough
pento to get through.

22:50.044 --> 22:51.344
The next few jobs, right?

22:51.379 --> 22:54.547
I'll look for a more affable
drug dealer,

22:54.582 --> 22:58.551
But in the meantime,
you stay away from grady, okay?

22:58.586 --> 23:02.455
Then we can focus on what
matters.

23:02.490 --> 23:04.857
Morgan lewis.

23:04.892 --> 23:08.060
Cystic fibrosis.

23:13.067 --> 23:15.001
You know, carly,
I saw your husband.

23:15.036 --> 23:16.435
Play football in college.

23:16.471 --> 23:18.671
He had a 75-yard once.

23:18.706 --> 23:19.772
I was at that game.

23:19.807 --> 23:20.973
He almost set a record.

23:21.009 --> 23:23.676
He had a real gift.

23:23.711 --> 23:26.312
So what is this about?

23:26.347 --> 23:29.915
Well, troy was treated at eden
general, correct?

23:29.951 --> 23:34.754
He ever talk to you about any of
his doctors or nurses?

23:34.789 --> 23:36.522
I mean, the staff loved him.

23:36.557 --> 23:39.525
He took pictures,
signed autographs.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.994
But when it got really bad, he
just wanted to go home.

23:42.030 --> 23:45.031
He didn't want people to
remember him like that.

23:45.066 --> 23:47.199
His medical record said he had
about six months,

23:47.235 --> 23:48.868
Maybe even a year.

23:48.903 --> 23:50.547
Didn't find it a little strange
that he died.

23:50.571 --> 23:52.405
Only after two months?

23:52.440 --> 23:53.973
Only two months?

23:54.008 --> 23:55.207
Try two years.

23:55.243 --> 23:57.176
That's how long he spent
fighting.

23:57.211 --> 24:00.946
I understand that troy was
alone when he died.

24:00.982 --> 24:03.883
He thought I needed a break.

24:03.918 --> 24:05.151
And he seemed fine.

24:05.186 --> 24:06.830
Well, you told the coroner
that his breathing.

24:06.854 --> 24:09.355
Had been labored all day.

24:09.390 --> 24:11.157
What is this really about?

24:11.192 --> 24:12.936
Well, we're just trying to
clarify the circumstances.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.860
Of your husband's death.

24:14.896 --> 24:16.762
Troy had cancer.

24:16.798 --> 24:18.230
He died.

24:18.266 --> 24:20.166
Seems pretty clear to me.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.637
I'd like to go now.

24:27.442 --> 24:30.009
Well, there are other ways to
get information on troy.

24:30.044 --> 24:31.677
She's hiding something.
Damn straight.

24:31.712 --> 24:33.223
She was probably sitting right
there when it happened.

24:33.247 --> 24:35.292
If she helped, it will mess up
that life insurance check.

24:35.316 --> 24:36.849
Yeah, exactly.

24:38.286 --> 24:40.186
Dr. Harris.

24:40.221 --> 24:43.456
Sonia, hi. How are you doing?

24:43.491 --> 24:45.825
Are you okay?

24:45.860 --> 24:48.661
He was... he was buying me a bike.

24:48.696 --> 24:51.831
Off craigslist, you know?

24:51.866 --> 24:53.399
That's why he was getting out
cash.

24:53.434 --> 24:57.903
That's why... I mean, 'cause I
wanted a stupid vintage bike.

24:57.939 --> 24:59.905
It's not your fault.

24:59.941 --> 25:03.642
He's on life support.

25:03.678 --> 25:08.214
But dr. Taylor says there are
more surgeries that can be done.

25:09.684 --> 25:13.185
He needs my consent.

25:13.221 --> 25:18.324
I know what... what matt said
before the surgery.

25:18.359 --> 25:23.028
But I think he was really
scared,

25:23.064 --> 25:26.832
And... and he had lost his faith.

25:26.868 --> 25:29.735
And I couldn't live with myself
if I made a decision.

25:29.770 --> 25:32.438
Based one something he said in a
moment of fear.

25:34.675 --> 25:36.275
Well, what should I do?

25:36.310 --> 25:39.778
It's not for me to decide.

25:39.814 --> 25:40.846
But you're a doctor.

25:40.882 --> 25:43.048
You deal with this stuff every
day.

25:43.084 --> 25:46.619
How... how do you decide when to
keep going.

25:46.654 --> 25:49.355
Or when to stop?

25:51.659 --> 25:55.561
You know, a patient said to me
once,

25:55.596 --> 25:59.665
"there's beauty in the
inevitable."

25:59.700 --> 26:02.268
She was facing death,
and she had accepted that.

26:02.303 --> 26:04.303
She had come to the end.

26:04.338 --> 26:07.006
And there was more that I could
have done for her as a doctor,

26:07.041 --> 26:10.976
But it wasn't my place to
question her decision.

26:11.012 --> 26:14.580
It's like ecclesiastes 3:11.

26:14.615 --> 26:17.116
I don't know that one.

26:17.151 --> 26:21.954
"He has made everything
beautiful in its time."

26:21.989 --> 26:24.290
God has a plan.

26:24.325 --> 26:27.226
And it's not our place to
question it.

26:27.261 --> 26:30.963
We just have to trust in his
wisdom.

26:34.435 --> 26:37.069
Then there's your answer.

26:40.107 --> 26:42.975
<i>I've been obsessing about it
all week.</i>

26:43.010 --> 26:45.277
<i>I don't know.
I mean, it makes sense,</i>

26:45.313 --> 26:48.547
The phone, the cash, the drugs.

26:48.583 --> 26:50.816
Yeah. These eggs are gross.

26:50.851 --> 26:53.652
And she lied for you,
which is crazy.

26:53.688 --> 26:56.222
I... i don't know what I should
do, like...

26:56.257 --> 26:57.990
Don't do anything, okay?

26:58.025 --> 27:00.159
The best thing to do when your
mom's a drug dealer.

27:00.194 --> 27:02.361
Is to just pretend it's not
happening.

27:02.396 --> 27:03.896
Yeah, but it's dangerous if
she...

27:03.931 --> 27:06.632
Jess, you can't tell anyone,
okay?

27:06.667 --> 27:09.868
It would ruin your life,
and mine.

27:11.539 --> 27:13.405
Yeah. So...

27:13.441 --> 27:16.041
Any idea how we're going to pay
for this?

27:16.077 --> 27:18.110
Thought you had money.

27:18.145 --> 27:20.112
I lied.

27:20.147 --> 27:23.449
It's okay.
We can just dine and dash.

27:23.484 --> 27:25.017
You're insane. No.

27:26.554 --> 27:28.420
Naomi. Naomi. No, no, no, no.

27:28.456 --> 27:30.623
Come on. What are you doing?

27:34.395 --> 27:36.795
Ladies, you forget to settle up?

27:36.831 --> 27:38.998
No, we left the money on
the counter.

27:39.033 --> 27:40.432
Hey, hey, stop.

27:40.468 --> 27:44.770
Hey, you two, stop. Stop.

27:46.941 --> 27:48.707
What seems to be the problem?

27:48.743 --> 27:50.442
This doesn't concern you, sir.

27:50.478 --> 27:52.378
Well, these are my nieces,
so yes,

27:52.413 --> 27:54.413
I think it concerns me.

27:54.448 --> 27:57.583
These girls left without paying.

27:59.153 --> 28:02.888
Girls, I told you to wait inside
for me.

28:05.893 --> 28:08.994
You know, these girls are...
They're home-schooled,

28:09.030 --> 28:12.364
So things fall between the
cracks.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.634
So what... what do you need, 20,
30 bucks?

28:16.937 --> 28:17.970
40.

28:19.573 --> 28:20.573
You girls ate a lot?

28:25.880 --> 28:28.047
Make sure the waiter gets
tipped.

28:34.088 --> 28:36.455
My god. Thank you.

28:36.490 --> 28:37.456
Yeah, thanks.

28:37.491 --> 28:39.792
Who are you?

28:39.827 --> 28:41.593
Why... why did you do that?

28:41.629 --> 28:44.530
Well, maybe I'm a good
samaritan.

28:49.470 --> 28:52.271
I was sure she'd pick chad,
but she chose brandon.

28:52.306 --> 28:56.742
No matter how many times you
tell me, it'll never matter.

28:56.777 --> 28:58.977
But it's the final rose.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.150
<i>Hello. - Hi, mary.</i>

29:05.186 --> 29:07.986
<i>Check your messages.</i>

29:08.022 --> 29:12.324
How did you get this number?

29:31.520 --> 29:33.020
We're moving you to a private
room.

29:33.055 --> 29:34.655
Why? What's going on?

29:34.690 --> 29:36.930
He doesn't need immediate
attention, and we need the bed,

29:36.959 --> 29:38.325
So we're sending him to icu.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.128
They know he's coming.

29:55.311 --> 29:57.055
Excuse me, we're gonna need to
ride with him.

29:57.079 --> 29:58.412
No more room. Take the next one.

29:58.447 --> 30:00.314
Room 141.

30:02.451 --> 30:04.217
<i>Chris daniels, call 156.</i>

30:04.253 --> 30:06.653
<i>Chris daniels, 156.</i>

30:06.689 --> 30:08.188
Room 141.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.663
Just before the chairs on your
right.

30:15.731 --> 30:18.732
Okay, stand down.

30:20.069 --> 30:23.203
I'm still alive.

30:23.238 --> 30:26.006
You mind shutting the door on
the way out?

30:26.041 --> 30:28.108
I'm gonna take a little nap.

30:28.143 --> 30:30.744
I'm not sure I want to hear
about hull's date last night.

30:30.779 --> 30:32.012
You jealous?

30:32.047 --> 30:33.981
Guaranteed I get more women
than both of you.

30:54.603 --> 30:58.438
Sid, come on.

30:58.474 --> 30:59.606
Put this on.

31:12.154 --> 31:13.320
What? Relax.

31:13.355 --> 31:15.022
She's probably playing hard to
get.

31:15.057 --> 31:16.223
Probably.

31:16.258 --> 31:18.291
So what do you think a good
follow-up emoji is?

31:18.327 --> 31:20.093
Do that one. This one.

31:20.129 --> 31:21.139
No, I'm not doing that.
That's just... no.

31:21.163 --> 31:22.662
Yeah, do it. Do it.

31:22.698 --> 31:23.663
What am I in grade six?

31:23.699 --> 31:25.032
That one.

31:25.067 --> 31:26.500
This one? Definitely.

31:26.535 --> 31:28.568
This?

31:32.574 --> 31:34.508
I'll take him from here.

31:34.543 --> 31:36.343
I thought I was doing this.

31:36.378 --> 31:38.912
I need to end this.

31:48.524 --> 31:51.458
Open the door.

31:56.365 --> 31:59.332
I think I should put you on
the payroll, dr. Harris.

32:04.473 --> 32:05.605
Okay, we're done.

32:05.641 --> 32:07.641
And if you ever go near my
family again,

32:07.676 --> 32:09.054
I'm calling the cops.
Come on, mary.

32:09.078 --> 32:11.111
Us criminals have to stick
together.

32:16.118 --> 32:19.052
Drive.

32:37.139 --> 32:38.338
I have to go now.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.844
Stay.

32:48.717 --> 32:51.051
Thanks for this, man.

32:51.086 --> 32:52.853
I owe you one.

32:55.090 --> 32:57.657
What were you doing in south
warren, sid?

32:59.628 --> 33:02.362
I was meeting a new client...

33:02.397 --> 33:05.999
A potential new client.

33:08.403 --> 33:11.071
What did you think was gonna
happen,

33:11.106 --> 33:13.440
That you could just steal my
product and walk into south

33:13.475 --> 33:15.675
Warren, and they're gonna
welcome you with open arms?

33:18.147 --> 33:19.779
This really doesn't concern me.

33:19.815 --> 33:21.715
I work hard to stay clean.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.850
I run my business.
I pay my taxes.

33:23.886 --> 33:27.387
And now you're in the system
again.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.656
And see, I can do that math,
sid.

33:29.691 --> 33:31.458
Two drugs convictions plus a
weapons charge.

33:31.493 --> 33:33.071
That equals you making a deal
with the police.

33:33.095 --> 33:34.928
Come on, grady.

33:34.963 --> 33:37.464
Look, I know I've done some
stupid, all right?

33:37.499 --> 33:39.399
But I would never do that.

33:41.470 --> 33:43.236
I'll do the time.

33:43.272 --> 33:45.739
You drop me to the police
station right now.

33:45.774 --> 33:49.276
It's too late.

33:53.415 --> 33:54.548
You can go.

33:57.753 --> 33:59.252
Take care of that leg, okay?

34:00.689 --> 34:02.989
Fresh bandages every day.

34:03.025 --> 34:05.425
Keep it elevated to reduce the
swelling.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.593
We have a coroner's letter to
release all the documents.

35:01.617 --> 35:03.450
Pertaining to troy dixon,

35:03.485 --> 35:05.752
Nurses, doctors, anyone who
might have come into contact.

35:05.787 --> 35:07.020
With him while he was here.

35:07.055 --> 35:08.855
What is this regarding?

35:08.890 --> 35:10.924
It's regarding an ongoing
investigation.

35:10.959 --> 35:14.561
We can't get into details right
now.

35:14.596 --> 35:15.596
All right, stay here.

35:15.631 --> 35:18.765
I'm gonna make a phone call.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.735
Excuse me.

35:24.673 --> 35:26.172
I have to go. Wait a minute.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.742
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:28.777 --> 35:31.044
I can't... i can't do this right
now.

35:31.079 --> 35:32.379
What's wrong? Nothing.

35:32.414 --> 35:35.548
I... i... I just have to get home
to my kids right now.

35:35.584 --> 35:37.450
Okay, okay, okay, just wait.

35:37.486 --> 35:41.821
Okay, look, just let me give you
my number, okay?

35:41.857 --> 35:44.624
This is my personal cell.

35:44.660 --> 35:45.660
If you need anything...

35:47.396 --> 35:50.297
If you need anything at all,
you just call, all right?

36:10.502 --> 36:11.902
Improvising.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.003
Did you get it? Yeah.

36:13.038 --> 36:15.605
Let me see. Here.

36:15.641 --> 36:18.775
I'm instagramming the
out of that.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.043
Look at this one. All right.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.144
Your turn now, darlin'.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.245
No. Go, be a model.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.446
No, no, no. I can't do that.

36:23.482 --> 36:24.814
Look. Lookit.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.983
Stop it.
Look at this one, though.

36:27.019 --> 36:28.451
Hey, mom, look at this. So cute.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.654
Okay, change of plans.
I have to work this weekend.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.556
So go inside, pack your stuff.

36:32.591 --> 36:35.825
I'm taking you to your dad's.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.060
But you said we were gonna...

36:37.095 --> 36:39.362
Cambie, we don't have time for
this; Go inside.

36:39.398 --> 36:42.699
Jess, I need to talk to you.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.301
I think she's in trouble.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.603
I know you skipped school today.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.815
What? I don't know what you're
talking about.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.673
Don't even try.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.586
Now, jess, when you're at
school, I know you're safe,

36:51.610 --> 36:52.820
And when you're not, I don't
know that,

36:52.844 --> 36:53.988
So you can't do that, all right?

36:54.012 --> 36:55.712
You can't skip school.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.647
You're such a hypocrite.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.116
What's that supposed to mean?

37:00.152 --> 37:03.887
Well, do think what you're
doing is really safe, mom?

37:18.303 --> 37:19.336
Mary, hi.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.804
Hi.

37:20.839 --> 37:21.871
Is kevin here?

37:21.907 --> 37:24.641
Kevin is at at the home depot.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.242
Is everything okay?

37:26.278 --> 37:28.378
Well, there's something going
around the hospital,

37:28.413 --> 37:29.446
And we're short-staffed.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.414
I've been called in. Okay.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.850
The girls are in the car.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.152
You have to work all weekend?
Yeah.

37:36.188 --> 37:39.489
I know you two are working on
the house, but...

37:39.524 --> 37:41.291
Free labor, right?

37:41.326 --> 37:43.660
I'd be so grateful.
Of course. No problem at all.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.895
Look, working mom. I get it.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.566
Girls. Be happy to take them.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.871
Hey, mom. Hey, sweetheart.

37:54.906 --> 37:58.208
Bye, mary.

37:58.243 --> 38:00.977
I'm so sorry I snapped at you
before, okay?

38:01.013 --> 38:02.979
It's okay.

38:03.015 --> 38:05.382
Like my lips?

38:05.417 --> 38:08.385
I love them.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.452
Go in.

38:11.757 --> 38:14.758
Thank you. Yeah, no problem.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.092
You know, I get it.

38:16.128 --> 38:19.529
When I was single, I know,
it was super hard.

38:19.564 --> 38:22.265
Yeah, it's really hard.

38:35.347 --> 38:37.414
I thought you quit.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.482
I did.

38:39.518 --> 38:42.552
Took it up again, because...
Let's see.

38:42.587 --> 38:45.622
Grady's using my daughter to
blackmail me.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.257
The cops are all over the
hospital.

38:47.292 --> 38:50.927
I lost my burner phone,
and yeah, sid's dead.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.564
What... What happened?

38:54.599 --> 38:57.901
See, that's exactly what I've
been trying to figure out,

38:57.936 --> 39:02.872
How I ended up risking my job
and my life and my kid.

39:02.908 --> 39:05.141
To help a psycho drug dealer
murder someone.

39:05.177 --> 39:06.676
Right in front of me.

39:06.712 --> 39:09.512
And the only thing I could think
of is you.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.650
Wait, you're blaming me for
this?

39:13.685 --> 39:15.785
I wouldn't even know grady if
it weren't for you.

39:17.255 --> 39:18.655
No, no, no, no, no.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.368
You know grady, because you
wanted to start this business.

39:20.392 --> 39:21.791
You brought me into this,
remember?

39:21.827 --> 39:23.571
I brought you in because you
lost your medical license,

39:23.595 --> 39:25.606
And I was trying to help you
feel like a doctor again.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.297
No, bull.

39:27.332 --> 39:28.998
This was never about me.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.600
This was your crusade.

39:30.635 --> 39:34.104
Because I wanted to help
people, give them a good death.

39:34.139 --> 39:38.308
And to work out that
about your mom?

39:38.343 --> 39:39.976
Your complex with the law.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.711
Come on, admit it.

39:41.747 --> 39:44.013
You get off on getting away with
it, don't you?

39:44.049 --> 39:45.448
I care about people.

39:45.484 --> 39:48.051
That's why I became a doctor,
a real doctor.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.755
Easy, easy.

39:51.790 --> 39:55.425
Okay, mary, yeah,
you're the real doctor.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.371
You just care about people.
Everything's my fault.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.673
Even though I'm the one that
told you.

39:58.697 --> 40:00.196
To stay away from grady.

40:00.232 --> 40:03.233
And I told you he came after
my kid.

40:03.268 --> 40:06.236
I didn't have a choice.

40:07.639 --> 40:11.040
I don't know.
I feel like you chose all of it.

41:09.201 --> 41:11.467
Thanks for coming.

41:11.503 --> 41:13.903
Yeah.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.705
I was worried about you.

41:18.510 --> 41:21.444
I saved some for you.

41:27.619 --> 41:31.688
What's with the motel?

41:31.723 --> 41:35.124
I don't know. I guess I needed
to get away from it all.

41:39.231 --> 41:41.764
Things got complicated for you?

41:45.303 --> 41:48.538
"Life is a ride in the dark."

41:48.573 --> 41:51.174
That's what my mom used to say.

41:55.213 --> 41:58.181
Why were you at the hospital?

41:58.216 --> 42:00.316
I was working.

42:00.352 --> 42:02.518
Why were you so upset?

42:08.059 --> 42:10.393
I lost a patient.

42:10.428 --> 42:12.395
Do you want to talk about it?

42:12.430 --> 42:14.030
No.

42:20.772 --> 42:22.872
Do you think that we could
ever truly be honest.

42:22.908 --> 42:26.576
With each other?

42:29.681 --> 42:30.813
No.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.316
That was honest.

42:35.654 --> 42:39.322
Why did you ask me here, mary?

42:39.357 --> 42:40.623
I didn't want to be alone.

42:42.894 --> 42:43.927
Why did you come?

43:32.644 --> 43:36.079

This perfect little doctor.

43:46.157 --> 43:47.457
With a nice house.

43:47.459 --> 43:48.858
And a pretty little daughter.

43:48.860 --> 43:51.394
And you are right there
on the edge.

43:51.396 --> 43:52.628
Yeah I am.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.064
Your client is the primary
suspect.

43:55.066 --> 43:56.599
In a murder investigation.

43:56.601 --> 43:57.533
You need to stop.

43:57.535 --> 43:58.835
I don't want to stop.

43:58.837 --> 44:00.737
I think there's something
wrong with me.

44:00.739 --> 44:01.804
Mary harris,

44:01.806 --> 44:03.940
She was investigated for the
murder of her mother.

44:03.942 --> 44:05.341
No, her mother died of cancer.

44:05.343 --> 44:06.843
She is manipulating you.
