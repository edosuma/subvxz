-Thanks, Andy.
-Did you drink?

00:43.460 --> 00:46.254
-Don't yell at me, all right?
-No.

00:48.465 --> 00:52.302
I feel like,
if I could drink,
then I could be with Bobby.

00:52.302 --> 00:56.473
-So then you know
what that means.
-But I want to be with him.

00:58.433 --> 01:02.437
I'm gonna lose him.
Maybe I already did.

01:04.230 --> 01:08.359
Whatever else is going on,
you can't add booze.

Put down one of the perps.
The other one fled
on foot.

He gave me a description.
I put it out.

two Spanish guys
got Tony out of the car.

-That one's got a gun on him.
-All right, back up.

05:36.169 --> 05:40.173

from the airport?
-He had flew in from Vegas.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.966
I'm half a bodyguard.
He would get paranoid.

05:41.966 --> 05:44.344
You know, those $10,000 rings
he's got on.

05:44.344 --> 05:48.097
-So you come out of the store.
-I draw my weapon.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.975
Tony's saying,
"Mike, shoot the sons
of bitches."

the attaché case

06:05.531 --> 06:07.158
-He takes off running.
-You fired at him?

06:07.158 --> 06:10.328
Just wanted to see
how Tony was doing.
Then I went and called it in.

06:10.328 --> 06:14.332
-What did he have
in the attaché case?
-Thieving scumbag.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.958
I don't even know what
he thought he was getting.

06:15.958 --> 06:19.212

kept in there was,
like, sheet music.

Nobody saw anything.

13:45.783 --> 13:49.203
Yeah? Well, maybe you got
some idea who it was...

13:49.203 --> 13:50.996
supposed to be
watching his back
if it wasn't you.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.208
How about that, Roberto, huh?
Who it could have been
cut and ran...

13:54.208 --> 13:56.210
while your buddy was
breathing his last breath.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.421
(groans, chuckles)
I wish I knew that too,

13:59.421 --> 14:04.468
because I'd be taking care
of it all by myself
without troubling you all.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.596
That's not how
you should be looking
at this, Roberto.

14:07.596 --> 14:09.598
The way you should be
looking at it,

14:09.598 --> 14:14.061
you count yourself lucky you
didn't catch a couple of hot
ones in the chest yourself.

14:14.061 --> 14:17.022
Do you hear what
I'm saying to you? Huh?

14:17.022 --> 14:19.024
You count yourself lucky.

14:19.024 --> 14:22.903
You don't go worrying
about who shot who.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.238
Are we done?

14:24.238 --> 14:26.824
You stand in a lineup?

14:26.824 --> 14:30.286
If this asshole will
let go of my jaw.

14:34.957 --> 14:35.875
Yeah.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.460
I'll stand in your lineup.

14:44.508 --> 14:47.511
♪♪

14:51.181 --> 14:55.519
-How's the coffee
this morning, Lieutenant?
-I don't know, Cohen.

14:55.519 --> 14:57.354
Roberto Roca's
not the guy,

14:57.354 --> 15:00.065
and he's no help
with who else might've
been with Vasquez.

15:00.065 --> 15:03.485
-Well, Zorzi tested clean.
-Well, that's
one good thing.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.321
Desk downstairs
is sending a guy up.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.948
Says he saw something
last night on Essex Street.

15:07.948 --> 15:10.075
Anything else on
the cars that were
parked along there?

15:10.075 --> 15:13.621
No. Diane's
still working on that.

15:13.621 --> 15:17.249
-They told me the detectives
are upstairs.
-Yes, sir. Can I help you?

15:17.249 --> 15:19.877
I witnessed a shooting
last night when I was
driving my cab.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.254
Mm-hmm. Where was this at?
On Essex Street.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.549
I didn't report it
when it happened.
I apologize for that.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.635
I'm Detective Sipowicz.
This is Detective Simone.
What's your name?

15:27.635 --> 15:30.763
I'm Rajnish Prasad.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.431
Let's go talk down here.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.391
Thank you.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.187
I made a right turn
onto Essex Street.

15:38.187 --> 15:41.065
I saw an Italian man
running out of the market.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.942
He was pointing a gun
at two other men...

15:42.942 --> 15:45.945
who were standing by
a car across the street.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.698
The Italian shoots twice,
hits one of those other men--
a Puerto Rican.

15:49.698 --> 15:52.826
Wait a minute.
You're rolling by, right?
It's night.

15:52.826 --> 15:54.995
How do you take note
that one of these guys
is Italian,

15:54.995 --> 15:57.039
the other one's
Puerto Rican?
I know that store.

15:57.039 --> 16:00.292
The Koreans own that store.
They can barely
speak English.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.461
They barely even try.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.797
Anyway, when I
see this happening,
I wonder if the owner...

16:04.797 --> 16:07.091
had chased a thief
out into the street.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.176
But the man in the doorway
is white.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.261
Not Korean.
And how do you know
he's Italian?

16:11.261 --> 16:13.681
I've seen enough
of them to know.
Believe me.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.850
Get in the cab, they don't
have a polite word to say.
Give you 25 cents for a tip.

16:16.850 --> 16:20.646
Are you sure on
the number of men you saw
standing by the car?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.815
Two men.
My impression--

16:22.815 --> 16:25.484
The Puerto Rican was
robbing the other one.

16:25.484 --> 16:29.113
My first week driving a cab,
a Puerto Rican boy stuck
a gun to my head.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.616
Welcome to New York.
You see anyone fleeing
the scene, Mr. Prasad?

16:32.616 --> 16:34.493
No. Nobody was fleeing
the scene.

16:34.493 --> 16:37.329
Was my impression right?

16:37.329 --> 16:39.873
The Puerto Rican
was robbing the other one?
We're piecing that together.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.959
Because even so,
that's no excuse...

16:41.959 --> 16:44.712
for the Italian
to shoot him in the street
like John Wayne.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.422
Robbery should be
handled by the police.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.590
Without law,
we don't have a city.
We have a jungle.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.260
Thanks very much
for coming in.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.972
We may call you
in a few days.
You're welcome.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.641
SIPOWICZ:
Thank you.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.685
The other way.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.104
We gotta call
that asshole Baumgartner...

17:02.104 --> 17:04.606
and have him let us know
when Zorzi gets back.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.400
Ask him about what
this guy's saying.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.068
MAN ON TV: You ready?
WOMAN ON TV:
Yeah. Yeah?

17:08.068 --> 17:10.404
Go. Here you go.

17:10.404 --> 17:16.410
I got it.
Wow. Look at that.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.495
-This is so sick.
-(woman laughing)

17:18.495 --> 17:22.416
-I don't understand
the turn-on.
-Something to do with feet.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.127
How do the worms fit in?
I mean, who'd pay money
to watch this?

17:25.127 --> 17:28.672
Well, if this
Crush-O-Rama 18 guy's
obviously selling things--

17:28.672 --> 17:31.675
-Fast forward to the end.
Maybe there's a mailing address.
-Hey.

17:31.675 --> 17:35.471
-Yeah.
-Guy that's coming up referred
over by Missing Persons.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.474
-He registered his daughter
last Thursday.
KIRKENDALL: Thanks.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.685
-"Michelle Mirren."
-Oh.

17:41.685 --> 17:45.606
-Hey, James, check this out.
-What were you
thinking about, Michelle,

17:45.606 --> 17:49.651
when you were crushing
that little worm
into a grease stain?

17:49.651 --> 17:52.654
Uh--

17:52.654 --> 17:54.448
I don't know.

17:54.448 --> 17:55.991
What kind of warped
piece of garbage
is that?

17:55.991 --> 17:59.495
-Something to do with feet.
-I'm gonna go see Gina.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.456
Here. Here's the post office box
at the end of the tape.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.458
We can trace the guy
through this.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.460
Turn off the tape.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.087
-Ah. I'm Walter Mirren.
-Hi.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.671
Detective Kirkendall.

18:09.671 --> 18:14.093
Missing Persons said you
might have some information
about my daughter.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.303
If you could answer
some questions for us,

18:16.303 --> 18:17.721
that would really
be helpful.

18:17.721 --> 18:20.516
-Detective Medavoy,
Walter Mirren.
-How do you do?

18:20.516 --> 18:23.560
My daughter
is Michelle Mirren.
She's missing.

18:25.979 --> 18:28.273
Mr. Mirren,
do you have any idea...

18:28.273 --> 18:31.693
if someone
might have wanted
to harm your daughter?

18:31.693 --> 18:34.947
-Uh, no.
-Boyfriend?

18:34.947 --> 18:38.325
If she was dating anybody,
it was in spite of me.

18:38.325 --> 18:41.495
I'd given her a curfew
because of, uh,

18:41.495 --> 18:42.996
disciplinary problems.

18:42.996 --> 18:45.916
How about girlfriends?
School friends?

18:45.916 --> 18:47.709
Turn around,
she's 16 years old.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.920
Everything's an argument.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.131
Her mother, uh--

18:52.131 --> 18:56.343
We divorced six years ago.
She moved across country.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.971
Keeps no kind of relationship
with Michelle.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.640
So in terms of friends
we might talk to--

19:01.640 --> 19:04.184
Uh, one girl came by the house.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.855
Tattoos on her arms.
I hit the roof.

19:07.855 --> 19:12.317
-Do you recall that girl's name?
-No. I didn't want
to know it.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.821
Did Michelle mention about
any friends involved...

19:15.821 --> 19:18.240
-in making videos?
-You mean at school?

19:18.240 --> 19:22.119
Oh, anywhere.
You know,
just goofing around.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.370
No, I don't think so.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.250
Are you, uh--
Are you hopeful...

19:28.250 --> 19:30.919
you might be able
to locate Michelle?

19:32.963 --> 19:33.881
Sir,

19:35.090 --> 19:39.636
I have to tell you
a girl's body's been found
which could be your daughter's.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.809
(exhales)
Oh, no.

19:45.809 --> 19:48.395
I have a photograph
I'm gonna ask you to look at.

19:49.855 --> 19:54.776
You need to prepare yourself
for the possibility
it's Michelle.

19:54.776 --> 19:55.861
Oh, no.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.172
(weeping)

20:19.718 --> 20:22.054
-Here's some water, sir.
-(sobbing)

20:27.768 --> 20:30.020
Just got back from ballistics.
Baumgartner said you
wanted to see me.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.898
-You mind coming upstairs?
-Did you get those
test results back?

20:32.898 --> 20:35.692
-This isn't about that.
-But you know
I wasn't lying, right?

20:35.692 --> 20:38.862
I just heard Mike
tested clean for drugs
and alcohol.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.323
Of course I tested clean.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.243
He tested clean. Now we need
to talk about something else.
Come on, Zorzi.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.412
-Call your delegate.
-Hey, Sarge, give us a break.

20:47.412 --> 20:50.415
-Guys wanna act
like their I.A.B.
-I.A.B.?

20:50.415 --> 20:52.417
Listen, we got some
information that we need...

20:52.417 --> 20:54.044
to clear up with you
about what went down.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.546
-Information?
-Call your delegate, Mike.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.590
We got a witness that saw
part of what went down,

20:58.590 --> 21:00.759
and we need to talk to you
about some of the details
that you told us about.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.762
-What witness? Some skell?
-Hey, will you stay
out of this?

21:03.762 --> 21:06.265
I'm gonna go call my delegate.
I think I should do that.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.228
Is there some reason that you're
looking to impede this
investigation, Sergeant?

21:11.228 --> 21:14.982
He's got rights
just like anybody else.
Why are you breaking his balls?

21:14.982 --> 21:16.650
-'Cause he's just
a uniform cop?
-Aw, come on.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.444
You're doing Zorzi
a big favor stirring
this thing up like this.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.864
Been in this precinct
seven years. I bet you can't
tell me his wife's name.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.450
Stop breathing booze
in my face.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.870
You think I'm drinking?
You wanna piss-test me too?

21:28.870 --> 21:30.664
Come on,
put your hands out.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.543
(chuckles)

21:40.132 --> 21:42.301
Good for you, Andy,
not going off.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.094
SIPOWICZ:
Digestion, blood pressure--

21:44.094 --> 21:46.638
Everything's gonna be
out of whack the whole
rest of the day...

21:46.638 --> 21:49.141
'cause I walk without
hitting this turd.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.642
Assholes.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.396
I got it.

21:55.939 --> 21:57.774
You just call me
an asshole, Mackey?

22:00.902 --> 22:02.946
Yeah, you call me an asshole
with my back turned.

22:02.946 --> 22:05.115
Now I'm here in front of you,
you got nothing to say, right?

22:05.115 --> 22:07.409
What am I supposed
to say to someone
looks to hurt his own?

22:07.409 --> 22:11.288
-No one is looking to hurt
Zorzi.
-Why don't you go up to the
squad?

22:11.288 --> 22:13.040
I don't know.
My shield says
New York City Police,

22:13.040 --> 22:15.542
so if I wanna go upstairs,
I'm gonna go upstairs.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.337
If I wanna stay right down here
in front of your face,
that's what I'm gonna do.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.049
Any more?

22:29.181 --> 22:31.600
No one is looking to hurt him.

23:03.673 --> 23:05.050
(knocking)

23:08.512 --> 23:10.389
Police. Can we talk?

23:10.389 --> 23:11.640
What did I do this time?

23:11.640 --> 23:15.394
Your post office box
is on a videotape
we've been tracking, Larry.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.812
Mind if we come in
and talk a minute?

23:16.812 --> 23:20.190
Yeah. All right.

23:20.190 --> 23:23.360
-Which one of my videos
we talking about?
-You knew Michelle Mirren?

23:23.360 --> 23:25.987
She run away
from her dad finally?
She's not here.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.781
What do you know
about her and her father?

23:27.781 --> 23:30.367
She said they fought a lot.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.660
When was the last time
you saw her?

23:31.660 --> 23:33.370
Uh, couple days ago.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.789
I gave her a copy
of my new crush tape
she starred in.

23:35.789 --> 23:39.584
-We've seen your crush tape.
-How'd you like it?

23:39.584 --> 23:41.795
Michelle's cute in it,
isn't she?

23:41.795 --> 23:45.048
Obviously she
didn't understand totally
what the fetish is all about,

23:45.048 --> 23:48.051

pretty good.

MEDAVOY:
You mind coming
to the station, Larry?

23:49.136 --> 23:51.430
Tell us more
about your relationship?

23:51.430 --> 23:55.851
Our relationship was,
I paid her $200
to squash earthworms.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.769
What's it about?
Has something happened to her?

23:57.769 --> 24:01.022
-Yeah.
-Bad?

24:01.022 --> 24:03.233
Michelle was murdered,
Larry.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.655
Uh, talk to her boyfriend.

24:08.655 --> 24:10.824
I got his number right here.

24:10.824 --> 24:15.036
Here, talk to him.
He's the one, actually,
I paid.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.622
He answered
an ad I took out
looking for models.

24:19.249 --> 24:20.959
He was turning her out.
Here.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.462
Will Scheltema.
That's his number.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.715
He's big into tattoos,
body piercing.

24:26.715 --> 24:29.176
Maybe some kind
of illicit substances also.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.094
We still need you to come
to the precinct.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.472
You got some more boxes
we can take these tapes in?

24:33.472 --> 24:35.891
Wait. Why do you have
to take the videotapes?

24:35.891 --> 24:37.976
'Cause it's a murder
investigation, Larry.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.979
I don't think you
can just take my tapes.
I got mail-order customers.

what items were recovered.

25:00.081 --> 25:04.044
No. No. No discussions

Nothing like that.

Trish Taylor--
Her car was parked
on Essex...

25:06.838 --> 25:08.673
maybe 120 feet
from the shooting.

25:08.673 --> 25:12.594
-She lives in Long Island City.
-She knows about the homicides?

25:12.594 --> 25:14.721
Watching about it
on television
when I showed up.

25:14.721 --> 25:17.349
Just keeps saying
why can't her car
be on Essex Street...

25:17.349 --> 25:19.768
-and acting jittery.
-Can you take her into 1?

25:19.768 --> 25:21.811
Mm-hmm.

25:23.271 --> 25:26.858
Mr. Green, realizing how I do,
what with you being a lawyer,

25:26.858 --> 25:30.195
you're probably all involved
with this case emotionally.

25:30.195 --> 25:33.114
I won't take offense,
you inferring
I'm a crook.

25:33.114 --> 25:37.160
Just end our little chat
suggesting that you kiss
my Polish ass.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.331
Aw, sleazebag shyster.

25:41.331 --> 25:45.460
He says Tony Moore
had possession of
substantial cash...

25:45.460 --> 25:47.546
off winning football wagers.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.631
If we recovered that money
he knows that number,

25:49.631 --> 25:51.550
and all of it
had better be there.

25:51.550 --> 25:56.179
Now, does that sound
like Tony's a courier
for mob money to you?

25:56.179 --> 25:59.307
Diane just brought in this girl
from Long Island City.

25:59.307 --> 26:03.186
Won't say why
her car was parked
on Essex Street last night.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.689
It's not enough
you guys are crucifying
Zorzi professionally,

26:05.689 --> 26:07.983
you want to ruin
his marriage too?

26:07.983 --> 26:10.026
Hey, what is
your problem now, Sergeant?

26:10.026 --> 26:12.404
-Don't try to be slick.
-About what?

26:13.488 --> 26:16.491
Nothin'. Up yours.

26:23.039 --> 26:26.293
-In the coffee room.
-Did Baumgartner see
this girl come in?

26:26.293 --> 26:30.547
-Yeah. Yeah, and it looked
like he recognized her too.
-Did Zorzi see her?

26:30.547 --> 26:33.800
No, he wasn't down there.
She connected with Zorzi?

26:33.800 --> 26:36.511
-It's worth a question.
-Mm-hmm.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.930
-Where you going?
-I gotta go somewhere.

26:57.198 --> 27:00.577
I'm Detective Simone.
This is Detective Sipowicz.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.787
You know, I can't
understand this.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.789
Why can't I park
on Essex Street?

27:04.789 --> 27:07.125
Uh, how is that
a police matter?

27:07.125 --> 27:10.378
Your car was identified
last night at the scene
of a double shooting.

27:10.378 --> 27:13.048
Why were you parked there,
you living so far away?

27:13.048 --> 27:16.843
Why can't I park
on Essex Street?

27:16.843 --> 27:18.637
SIMONE:
Let me be honest.

27:18.637 --> 27:22.140
You're in a grave situation.
Obstructing a homicide
investigation--

27:22.140 --> 27:25.894
-That makes you complicit
in the crime.
-I could go to prison?

27:25.894 --> 27:28.688
If you hold back information
that you know to be relevant,

27:28.688 --> 27:31.358
yes, you will be locked up,
because we're gonna do
what we have to do...

27:31.358 --> 27:33.401
to find out the truth.

27:33.401 --> 27:37.572
Why'd Mike want
your car there?

27:37.572 --> 27:40.825
-I don't know what
you're talking about.
-Sure you do.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.827
-No.
-Why did he want it there?

27:45.789 --> 27:48.541
He just told me to park
the car there by 10:00,

27:48.541 --> 27:51.711
and then to come back
and pick it up
at 4:00 a.m. this morning.

27:51.711 --> 27:54.506
-That's all he told me.
-And you did park it there
like he asked?

27:54.506 --> 27:57.425
He said he needed to use the car
to take care of some business.

27:57.425 --> 28:01.513
The next couple of minutes
are really important minutes
in your life, Miss Taylor.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.099
You have to be honest.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.518
TAYLOR:
That's all he said.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.646
And he said that it
was gonna be good--

28:09.646 --> 28:12.649
That things were
gonna be good for us
once he took care of this,

28:12.649 --> 28:15.276
and I wasn't supposed
to ask him any questions.

28:15.276 --> 28:18.655
He was gonna leave his wife.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.824
Our lives were gonna change.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.410
-(groans)
-When you picked up...

28:23.410 --> 28:25.704
your car from Essex Street,
did Mike leave anything
in it?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.789
-No.
-No?

28:29.457 --> 28:31.918
Mike came back at 6:00
this morning,

28:31.918 --> 28:35.922
and he went into the trunk
and he took out a briefcase.

28:35.922 --> 28:37.924
I mean, he didn't even
come into the house.
He just--

28:37.924 --> 28:41.928
I heard him drive up.
He got out, he went
in the trunk.

28:41.928 --> 28:44.639
Got the briefcase
and drove away.

28:46.516 --> 28:49.227
-Am I under arrest?
-Sit tight for a few minutes.

28:49.227 --> 28:52.313
All right--
(indistinct)

28:52.313 --> 28:57.318
-This lying bastard Zorzi.
-We gotta go pick him up.

28:57.318 --> 28:58.695
-In the corner?
-Yeah, thank you.

28:58.695 --> 29:01.030
Andy.

29:01.030 --> 29:03.491
-You been outside,
last little while?
-No. Why?

29:03.491 --> 29:05.577
You might want to check
on your car.

29:05.577 --> 29:08.455
What happened to my car?

29:08.455 --> 29:11.541
-Andy, I'll run it
for the boss.
-Yeah.

29:27.807 --> 29:29.851
Son of a bitch.

29:31.019 --> 29:32.937
I don't believe this.

29:32.937 --> 29:37.358
Who's the yellow
son of a bitch
scratched up my car, huh?

29:37.358 --> 29:39.944
None of youse got the balls
to stand up for what you did?

29:39.944 --> 29:42.614
Don't mess with my car.
Mess with me.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.491
Write "rat" on me.

29:46.075 --> 29:48.578
Shannon!
You scratch up my car?

29:48.578 --> 29:51.998
What? You don't got guts enough
to open your mouth?

29:51.998 --> 29:55.084
Look, I understand you're
pissed off, but I didn't
scratch up your car,

29:55.084 --> 29:58.630
-and I ain't taking no abuse.
-Who scratched "rat" on my car?

29:58.630 --> 30:01.090
Andy, back away from me.
Or what?

30:01.090 --> 30:03.218
-Or you'll find out what.
-Stay on the landing.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.969
Stay where you are, Bobby.

30:04.969 --> 30:07.639
Back up. Back up.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.641
Sergeant,
handle your people.

30:09.641 --> 30:13.478
-Cool out, Andy.
-Gutless hump scratched my car.
I thought you were a decent guy.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.772
-It wasn't me.
-Andy, upstairs.

30:15.772 --> 30:17.440
You think we're looking
to hurt your guy?

30:17.440 --> 30:20.401
He's an asshole,
and I still won't
put the bracelets on him.

30:20.401 --> 30:22.779
Come on. Let's go. Step back.
Move!

30:22.779 --> 30:25.156
-Screw you guys.
-Everybody,
shut your mouth.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.408
Oh, that's right, Baumgartner.

30:27.408 --> 30:30.036
It's starting to dawn on you,
you backed the wrong horse?

30:39.754 --> 30:42.799
♪♪

30:51.850 --> 30:53.476
MAN:
Lieutenant?
-How you doing?

30:53.476 --> 30:56.229
We got the warrant
for Officer Zorzi's home.
Who's coming with us?

30:56.229 --> 30:59.899
-Detectives Sipowicz and
Simone, if that's all right.
-Yeah. Fine.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.862
By the way,
congratulations,
Detective--

31:03.862 --> 31:05.655
-Making first grade.
-Thanks.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.241
Understand this case you fellas
have been getting a taste
of what we get every day.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.243
-"The Rat Squad."
-Hope that don't mean
you're gonna want...

31:10.243 --> 31:13.830
to hold hands
on the way over.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.456
KIRKENDALL:
Boss?
-Yeah?

31:15.456 --> 31:18.418
Greg and I got a hit
on the alarm we put out
on that dump job.

31:18.418 --> 31:21.045
-D.O.A.'s boyfriend
is in 3.
-How'd he turn up?

31:21.045 --> 31:24.716
He took a collar last night
in the 27 for a traffic stop.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.093
-They found coke
in his car.
-It's your catch.

31:27.093 --> 31:30.221
-How do you want to handle
the interview?
-I'd like to try him.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.515
If he has
a problem with me,
I'll hand off to Greg.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.475
-All right.
-Great.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.900
-Thanks.
-Thanks, Harold.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.279
So where we going now?

31:46.279 --> 31:48.865
Did you get high
last night, Will?

31:52.452 --> 31:54.871
Look, what can I tell you guys
to get out of this, huh?

31:54.871 --> 31:56.873
I mean, I can tell you
who I score from.

31:56.873 --> 32:00.710
No. Why don't you
tell us about Michelle?

32:00.710 --> 32:02.629
-Michelle?
-Your girlfriend.

32:02.629 --> 32:05.506
Oh.
(sniffs)

32:05.506 --> 32:07.967
All right. Well, uh--

32:07.967 --> 32:09.969
I mean, that
I can tell you about.

32:09.969 --> 32:12.430
Go ahead.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.390
All right. Uh--

32:14.390 --> 32:16.976
Michelle was over
my place last night,

32:16.976 --> 32:20.980
and, uh, she'd never
sniffed coke before.

32:20.980 --> 32:22.899
So I thought she should
experience that, you know?

32:22.899 --> 32:27.320
I mean, she hadn't
really experienced much
before she met me.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.323
But then
she just flat-out refused.

32:31.741 --> 32:36.204
She thought she'd get,
like, instantly addicted
or something, you know?

32:36.204 --> 32:39.582
And she's looking at me,
you know, with this look
in her face.

32:39.582 --> 32:42.543
I remember getting really angry
that she was refusing
to do it.

32:42.543 --> 32:45.964
-I mean, like, really
on the verge of anger.
-Then what happened?

32:45.964 --> 32:48.800
That's not a place
I want to be at.
You know, that kind of anger.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.095
-Was the coke
pushing you there?
-I wouldn't let it happen.

32:52.095 --> 32:57.392
What I did was, I, uh,
walked outside...

32:57.392 --> 33:00.019
and I walked
around the block--
I don't know--

33:00.019 --> 33:02.563
like, three or four times.

33:02.563 --> 33:05.942
And, uh, tested myself.
Made sure I'd cooled out.

33:05.942 --> 33:09.112
-Uh-huh.
-Uh--

33:10.571 --> 33:15.326
I don't know.
Must've been, like,
20 minutes or so...

33:15.326 --> 33:17.662
and I went back upstairs.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.373
Like a half hour.

33:20.373 --> 33:23.001
And--

33:23.001 --> 33:25.878
She was, uh,
lying on the floor--

33:25.878 --> 33:27.588
Michelle--

33:27.588 --> 33:28.923
with, uh,

33:30.550 --> 33:32.427
all these holes
in her chest.

33:32.427 --> 33:35.221
Somebody must have
broke in and stabbed her.

33:35.221 --> 33:38.433
What it must have been.
Will.

33:38.433 --> 33:42.437
You know that's not
what happened.

33:42.437 --> 33:43.855
No, it is.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.815
That's exactly
what must have happened.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.110
How'd her body
get in that Dumpster?

33:50.695 --> 33:53.239
Uh, well, with that, I--

33:53.239 --> 33:54.991
See, I just kind of--
I don't know--
I kind of freaked out.

33:54.991 --> 33:59.829
You know, when I saw her
I didn't know what to do,
and, uh--

33:59.829 --> 34:04.292
And so I took her
and I put her in there.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.835
I mean, I know that
that was wrong,

34:05.835 --> 34:08.212
and that was why
I was driving around
so upset afterwards.

34:08.212 --> 34:13.468
But I didn't kill her.
I mean, I swear
I didn't kill her.

34:13.468 --> 34:15.720
You felt something
for this girl?

34:15.720 --> 34:17.138
Yeah.

34:20.475 --> 34:25.063
Well, I'm looking at these
photographs here--
what was done to her.

34:27.315 --> 34:30.443
Do you want
to go into court,
they show these pictures,

34:30.443 --> 34:34.405
and it looks like
you just cold-bloodedly
killed her?

34:37.658 --> 34:40.661
I've heard
how it can be with coke.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.830
You do things.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.083
It's like
a blackout almost.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.335
And it's like
someone else did it.

34:47.335 --> 34:48.961
Was it like that?

34:50.129 --> 34:51.589
Yeah.

34:53.299 --> 34:54.967
It was.

34:56.636 --> 35:01.307
-What did you
stab her with, Will?
-A screwdriver.

35:03.309 --> 35:07.647
I'm telling you, man,
I don't remember doing it.

35:07.647 --> 35:12.819
Will, do you remember
and just feel awful?

35:12.819 --> 35:15.404
Like you'd do anything
if it hadn't happened?

35:18.116 --> 35:19.992
Yeah.

35:22.703 --> 35:25.039
You want to write it down
for me?

35:25.039 --> 35:28.376
Yeah, but I--
In a minute.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.836
Okay.

35:34.298 --> 35:37.343
My wife's been in and out
of private hospitals.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.554
Five different shrinks.

35:39.554 --> 35:43.558
The expense is incredible,
apart from just
the pressure of that...

35:43.558 --> 35:45.726
and trying to find
my own happiness.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.770
So I made this plan.

35:47.770 --> 35:50.189
Tony was like a courier,

35:50.189 --> 35:52.775
and him knowing
it was the mob's money,

35:52.775 --> 35:56.154
I knew there's no way
he's gonna give it up
to Joe Vasquez,

35:56.154 --> 36:00.533
which meant I knew
what I was gonna find
when I came out of that store.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.743
You'd predetermined you were
gonna kill Joe Vasquez--

36:02.743 --> 36:05.955
-And Tony?
-And when I was
inside the store,

36:05.955 --> 36:08.833
I put a glove on my left hand.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.960
So after I shot Vasquez,

36:10.960 --> 36:14.547
I ran up, got his gun,
and I shot Tony twice
with that.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.174
Also part of the plan?

36:16.174 --> 36:20.595
You see, this plan
just took hold in my mind.

36:20.595 --> 36:24.599
It was like an obsession.
I spent months planning this.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.185
How you were gonna
murder your friend,
and lie to the people...

36:27.185 --> 36:29.395
-that you work with.
-Detective.

36:29.395 --> 36:33.357
Tony used to torment me
with that money he was moving.

36:33.357 --> 36:36.152
We'd be in the car--
"Hey, Mike.

36:36.152 --> 36:39.155
"You ever seen
a million dollars?

36:39.155 --> 36:41.157
Go ahead, feel it."

36:41.157 --> 36:43.784
But still, see,
that's where it fell apart,

36:43.784 --> 36:47.371
because after
I had executed my plan--

36:47.371 --> 36:51.584
and gotten away with it--
the thing that really
bothered me...

36:51.584 --> 36:55.129
-was what I'd done
to my friend.
-Your friend Tony.

36:55.129 --> 36:56.422
Ayayay.

36:56.422 --> 36:58.216
Detective Sipowicz,
I'm gonna ask you
to refrain...

36:58.216 --> 37:01.385
-from this part
of the questioning.
-Yeah, sure.

37:01.385 --> 37:05.723
So, Tony's dead,
you shot Vasquez.
Now what?

37:05.723 --> 37:08.643
I put the attaché case
in the trunk
of my girlfriend's car.

37:08.643 --> 37:12.939
I tell you, if I'd have just
left the country
with that million dollars,

37:12.939 --> 37:15.191
I'd be long gone,

37:15.191 --> 37:16.692
and you guys
would be sitting here...

37:16.692 --> 37:18.611
scratching your balls.

37:18.611 --> 37:22.657
But smart like you are,
you figure you'll get away
with no one suspecting,

37:22.657 --> 37:24.283
right, Zorzi?

37:25.868 --> 37:29.038
That's why I came up
with the second robber
getting away with the money.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.624
-Yeah, your phantom
Puerto Rican number two.
-Detective!

37:31.624 --> 37:36.754
You're right.
Let me get the hell out of here,
breathe some clean air.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.839
-You hear this moron?
-Shh.

37:38.839 --> 37:41.676
What I didn't figure
was you finding out
about Trish.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.053
Oh, yeah, that was a tough one.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.263
He didn't figure
that we would canvass
the plates...

37:45.263 --> 37:47.890
-at the crime scene.
-Sipowicz.

37:47.890 --> 37:50.559
That caught me by surprise.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.812
I should have never let her
be part of this.

37:52.812 --> 37:55.064
Didn't figure
we'd come up with Trish,

37:55.064 --> 37:57.775
didn't think we'd tear down
this phantom Puerto Rican
number two--

37:57.775 --> 38:01.279
which took us about 27 minutes,
you murdering scumbag nitwit!

38:01.279 --> 38:03.447
Will someone shut him up?

38:03.447 --> 38:06.158
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

38:07.910 --> 38:10.830
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

38:26.929 --> 38:30.725
-Zorzi's going?
-He's in there with I.A.B.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.394
-No remorse at all.
-All my heart
I thought you guys...

38:33.394 --> 38:36.272
were on the wrong track.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.400
Probably I.A.B.'s gonna want
to make it look like
they cracked the case, huh?

38:39.400 --> 38:41.694
So now it's you and us,
right, Baumgartner?

38:41.694 --> 38:44.488
Stand-up cops
against the Rat Squad?

38:44.488 --> 38:48.492
You notice any stripes
on my arms, Sipowicz?

38:48.492 --> 38:51.871
You never gave a damn
about Zorzi.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.040
You're a mean drunk--

38:54.040 --> 38:58.502
Decides the shift agitating
over Zorzi is how you're
gonna make people miserable.

38:58.502 --> 39:01.630
And you can shove
those stripes up your ass.

39:01.630 --> 39:04.884
Nothing worse
than a reformed souse.

39:04.884 --> 39:07.178
Before you get
all disciplinary, Sarge,

39:07.178 --> 39:09.555
you just remember
that you invited
Detective Sipowicz here...

39:09.555 --> 39:12.892
to cup his hands for you,
and I was the witness.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.944

the last couple hours.

39:34.705 --> 39:36.415

Hey, uh,

a rain check.

-Sure.
-Sorry.

I understand.

39:57.728 --> 40:00.981
-I'm gonna look where
her and me had coffee.
-Yeah.

40:00.981 --> 40:02.983
Let me go to that Patrick's.

40:02.983 --> 40:05.361
-Where she was at
with Liery?
-Mm-hmm.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.683
'Cause it's frightening.

41:17.683 --> 41:20.478
-I don't know.
-I don't want a drink,
but I feel...

41:20.478 --> 41:24.064
like I'm almost dizzy,
and afraid, like things
don't exactly look real--

41:24.064 --> 41:26.859
Like, I'll look at you
and I know you're
next to me,

41:26.859 --> 41:29.278
but then it
looks like you're
15 feet away or so.

41:29.278 --> 41:31.780
Diane, I need you to try
to take it easy for me
a little bit.

41:31.780 --> 41:35.284
-Okay?
-I left because it was
happening in the squad,

41:35.284 --> 41:38.662
but then it was happening
while I was walking around.

41:38.662 --> 41:40.456
I'm glad you came over here,

41:40.456 --> 41:43.292
-but I want you to try
and take it easy, all right?
-I'm scaring you.

41:43.292 --> 41:47.296
No. Not at all.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.924
I don't want to be
like this forever.
I can't stand it.

Hey. Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

41:55.930 --> 42:00.351
What is it?
Hmm? Can you think
of what it is?

42:00.351 --> 42:02.728
Can you tell me what it is
that's scaring you?

42:02.728 --> 42:06.232
I-I--
I think something happened.

42:06.232 --> 42:08.692
With Liery--
When he drugged you that time.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.569
Hmm?

42:12.071 --> 42:14.698
Something happened, Bobby.

42:15.908 --> 42:18.536
Yeah, we're gonna
get through it.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.037
Okay?

Don't you doubt

I'm sorry for what I did.

42:28.671 --> 42:30.047
I-I didn't mean that
to happen.

42:30.047 --> 42:32.883
No, Diane, it was the job
that put you through that.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.969
You didn't ask
for what happened there.

42:34.969 --> 42:38.514
If I led him on.
If I was a flirt.

42:38.514 --> 42:40.474
No, no.

42:43.185 --> 42:46.397
I just didn't
want him to yell,
so I must have flirted.

42:51.026 --> 42:52.945
This guy--
He broke bad with you, right?

42:52.945 --> 42:55.322
He broke bad with you--
Liery?

42:58.242 --> 43:00.369
I didn't know--

43:00.369 --> 43:03.205
I didn't know
that would happen.

43:04.498 --> 43:07.167
I was only 12.

43:09.253 --> 43:12.381
I didn't know
that would happen,

43:12.381 --> 43:15.551
and I don't
even think I flirted.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.640
-Oh, Diane.

I--I just--

43:39.199 --> 43:42.077
I didn't want him
to yell at me
like Mom and Dougie.

43:42.077 --> 43:44.330
It's okay.

43:44.330 --> 43:47.291
I must have flirted,
but I don't think I did.

43:49.335 --> 43:51.587
Okay.

It's out now.
You know, you got it out.

-Daddy's pretty pet.
-You got it out.
