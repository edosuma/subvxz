[upbeat music]

00:04.700 --> 00:09.330
*

00:09.370 --> 00:10.803
- HELLO, DAD.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.637
WHAT IS THIS,
DO YOUR JOB HALF-ASS DAY

00:12.680 --> 00:14.500
AT THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT?

00:14.540 --> 00:16.371
WE'VE GOT SERIOUS BUSINESS
TO TEND TO.

00:16.410 --> 00:17.707
- SERIOUS BUSINESS?

00:17.750 --> 00:19.775
YOU'RE GOING TO THE OPENING
OF A NEW CUPCAKE STORE.

00:19.820 --> 00:23.119
- NO, WE'RE GOING TO A CLOSING
OF AN OLD CUPCAKE STORE.

00:23.150 --> 00:24.117
- AND THEN WE'RE
GOING TO THE OPENING

00:24.150 --> 00:25.344
OF A NEW CUPCAKE STORE.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.551
- BRING ME BACK
A RED VELVET.

00:27.590 --> 00:30.184
- AH, JUST
GIVE US OUR CHECK.

00:30.230 --> 00:34.223
- SIGN.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.167
THERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.169
I'M GONNA DIE AND COME BACK
AS THAT PEACH SCARF.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.531
- WHA--?

00:46.580 --> 00:47.569
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO
COME BACK AS THE SKINNY ELVIS.

00:47.610 --> 00:49.703
- NO, YOU WANTED TO COME BACK
AS SKINNY ELVIS.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.275
I WANTED TO COME BACK
AS BLACK MICHAEL JACKSON.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.673
- NOW YOU'RE
DOWNGRADING TO A SCARF?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.608
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

00:55.650 --> 00:57.186
- WE'LL BE KEEPING
THIS REPORT ON FILE

00:57.220 --> 00:59.654
AND IF YOU NEED
ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING ELSE

00:59.690 --> 01:00.679
PLEASE DON'T HESITATE
TO GIVE ME A CALL.

01:00.720 --> 01:01.618
- WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?

01:01.660 --> 01:04.288
- I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
THE SAME QUESTION.

01:04.330 --> 01:05.319
- UM, GUS.

01:05.360 --> 01:06.622
PLEASE, THIS WOMAN
MAY HAVE WITNESSED A CRIME.

01:06.660 --> 01:08.252
- A CRIME IN PROGRESS.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.565
SHE'S STEALING MY HEART,
BUT I AIN'T PRESSING CHARGES.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.737
- WOW.

01:12.770 --> 01:14.192
I WOULD LIKE TO APOLOGIZE

01:14.240 --> 01:15.195
FOR MY CREEPY COLLEAGUE.

01:15.240 --> 01:16.207
- NO NEED.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.868
I FIND HIS ENERGY
VERY SOOTHING.

01:18.910 --> 01:20.571
- REALLY?

01:20.610 --> 01:23.443
YOUR SILHOUE'I'I'E
SHOULD BE ON A MUD FLAP.

01:23.480 --> 01:25.402
- THAT'S THE WEIRDEST FLIRTING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

01:25.450 --> 01:26.747
- BURTON GUSTER, P.I.

01:26.780 --> 01:27.815
MY APOLOGIES
FOR YOUR TRAUMATIC

01:27.850 --> 01:29.681
CRIME-SEEING EXPERIENCE.

01:29.720 --> 01:30.880
- OH.

01:30.920 --> 01:31.887
- GUYS.

01:31.920 --> 01:32.887
SIDEBAR?

01:32.920 --> 01:34.217
- SURE.

01:34.260 --> 01:38.219
- YEAH, WE'LL
BE RIGHT BACK.

01:38.260 --> 01:40.353
DON'T GO ANYWHERE
NEAR THIS ONE.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.424
- WHY IS THAT?

01:41.460 --> 01:42.688
- BECAUSE JANIS JOPLIN
OVER THERE

01:42.730 --> 01:44.823
IS CRAZIER
THAN JANICE DICKINSON.

01:44.870 --> 01:46.690
THIS GIRL'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN DOING
TOO MUCH OF THIS.

01:46.740 --> 01:50.631
[inhales loudly]

01:50.670 --> 01:52.228
- SUFFERING FROM
HEMORRHOID PAIN?

01:52.280 --> 01:55.499
- DOING AN INACCURATE IMPRESSION
OF DR. EVIL IN SPACE?

01:55.540 --> 01:57.849
- SHE CLAIMS SHE
WITNESSED A MURDER IN AN ALLEY

01:57.880 --> 02:00.576
RIGHT OFF OF MAIN STREET
AT THE HEIGHT OF LUNCH HOUR.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.746
- THAT IS CRAZY.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.247
NO CHANCE OF GETTING A TABLE
AFI'ER THAT.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.814
- WE CHECKED WITH
ALL THE BUSINESSES IN THE AREA.

02:04.850 --> 02:06.408
THE ONLY WEIRD THING
ANYONE SAW WAS A GIRL

02:06.460 --> 02:08.781
A PEACH SCARF
DANCING OFF A GREYHOUND BUS.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.720
- SO? THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

02:10.760 --> 02:11.784
- LOOK AT THE GIRL.

02:11.830 --> 02:13.752
SHE'S BEEN LIVING
IN THE HILLS,

02:13.800 --> 02:16.325
SHE HASN'T BEEN DOWN
TO THE CITY IN FIVE YEARS.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.769
SHE MEDITATED
DURING THE INTERVIEW.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.768
THE ONLY UNDERSTANDABLE THING
IN THE WITNESS STATEMENT

02:19.800 --> 02:22.268
WAS A DOODLE
OF THREE LARGE CIRCLES.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.663
- MAYBE A SNOWMAN DID IT.
- OKAY.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.666
YOU'VE BEEN WARNED.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.905
- OKAY.

02:27.940 --> 02:28.907
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.874
AS MUCH AS I LIKE TO ZIG
WHEN LASSITER ZAGS,

02:30.910 --> 02:32.275
I'M FEELING PRETTY ZAGGY.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.742
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE HIT THE, UH,

02:33.780 --> 02:34.940
MUSEUM OF LACTOSE INTOLERANCE

02:34.980 --> 02:35.947
LIKE YOU'VE
BEEN WANTING TO.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.641
- NO CAN DO, SHAWN.

02:37.690 --> 02:38.918
I FEEL A CASE COMIN' ON,

02:38.950 --> 02:40.486
AND IT'S COMIN' HARD.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.819
_ EH--

02:43.860 --> 02:46.397
THAT'S THE CREEPIEST EUPHEMISM
OF ALL TIME.

02:47.830 --> 02:49.923
SO WHAT DID THE KILLER
LOOK LIKE EXACTLY?

02:49.970 --> 02:54.361
- I DON'T REMEMBER, BUT
IT HAPPENED RIGHT OVER THERE.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.367
- OKAY.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.265
SO YOU DIDN'T
SEE THE KILLER,

02:57.310 --> 02:58.732
YOU BARELY
SAW THE VICTIM,

02:58.770 --> 03:00.738
AND YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE
LOOKING DOWN THE ALLEY?

03:00.780 --> 03:03.874
- WAIT, NO, I DO REMEMBER
SOMETHING ABOUT THE VICTIM.

03:03.910 --> 03:07.778
HE HAD
A VERY HEAW PRESENCE.

03:07.820 --> 03:08.775
- MMM, THAT'S GOOD.

03:09.650 --> 03:10.844
- YES, FOR THIS
CONVERSATION IT IS.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.585
- OH, I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.349
GUS, OVER HERE.

03:14.390 --> 03:17.689
- EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND.

03:17.730 --> 03:18.685
YOU THINK
SHE'S MAKING IT UP?

03:18.730 --> 03:19.697
- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.698
I GUESS I THINK
SHE BELIEVES IT.

03:21.730 --> 03:23.266
THE ONLY REASON WE'RE
LISTENING TO ANY OF THIS

03:23.300 --> 03:24.699
IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A CRUSH ON HER.

03:24.730 --> 03:26.698
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU
INTO THE GRANOLA CHICKS ANYWAY?

03:26.740 --> 03:29.538
- FIRST OF ALL,
DON'T TRY TO PUT ME IN A BOX.

03:29.570 --> 03:30.901
I'M A COMPLICATED MAN
WHO LIKES COMPLICATED WOMEN.

03:30.940 --> 03:32.271
AND BRAZILIANS.

03:32.310 --> 03:33.834
SECONDLY, I'VE SEEN YOU
TAKE A CASE

03:33.880 --> 03:35.802
BASED ON
THE TESTIMONY OF A CAT.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.841
- IT WAS SUSPICIOUS MEOWING.

03:36.880 --> 03:39.519
NOT TESTIMONY,
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

03:39.550 --> 03:41.711
TRUST ME, THIS GIRL
DID NOT WITNESS A MURDER.

03:41.750 --> 03:42.887
[engine rewing]

03:42.920 --> 03:46.617
[tires squealing]

03:51.790 --> 03:55.396
- UNH!

03:56.770 --> 03:57.725
- [sniffs]

03:57.770 --> 03:58.919
I'VE GIVEN IT SOME THOUGHT,

03:58.970 --> 04:00.597
AND I'M WILLING
TO RECONSIDER.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.664
- YOU THINK?

04:01.700 --> 04:03.964
SOMEONE IS AFTER HER.

04:04.010 --> 04:07.730
- NO, SHAWN, SHE CAN'T
STAY HERE AT MY PLACE.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.475
- OH, COME ON, JULES.

04:09.510 --> 04:12.616
A CAR ZOOMED OUT OF NOWHERE
AND ALMOST RAN HER OVER.

04:12.650 --> 04:13.810
- ON THE SIDEWALK?

04:13.850 --> 04:15.044
- NO, NO, NOT EXACTLY.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.809
- SO WHERE WAS
SHE STANDING?

04:16.850 --> 04:18.715
- SHE WAS, UM--
- SHAWN.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.809
- SHE WAS IN THE AREA DIRECTLY
BETWEEN THE TWO SIDEWALKS.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.828
- SO SHE WAS
IN THE STREET.

04:22.860 --> 04:23.622
- ONLY SORT OF.

04:23.660 --> 04:24.752
- DID YOU GET
A LOOK AT THE CAR?

04:24.790 --> 04:25.586
- YES, I DID.

04:25.630 --> 04:27.757
DARK BLUE SEDAN,
NO LICENSE PLATES.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.721
OR LICENSE PLATES.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.422
- LOOK, I WOULD
REALLY LIKE TO BELIEVE HER,

04:31.470 --> 04:32.835
BUT SHE'S MAKING IT
VERY DIFFICULT.

04:32.870 --> 04:33.837
AND DON'T THINK
I DIDN'T SEE GUS

04:33.870 --> 04:35.929
DOING THAT THING THAT HE DOES
WITH HIS LIP.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.608
THIS BETTER NOT BE
SOME ELABORATE

04:37.640 --> 04:39.904
WINGMAN ACT
ON YOUR PART.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.703
LOOK, THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES
ON MY PART

04:41.740 --> 04:42.775
IF I INTERCEDE
AT THIS POINT,

04:42.810 --> 04:43.970
ESPECIALLY
IN MY OWN HOME.

04:44.010 --> 04:44.977
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

04:45.010 --> 04:46.910
SO TAKE HER
SOMEPLACE SECURE

04:46.950 --> 04:48.770
AND WE WILL CHECK OUT
THE BLUE SEDAN.

04:48.820 --> 04:51.414
AND THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU
AT THIS POINT.

04:51.450 --> 04:53.782
- ALL RIGHT, WE'LL
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.755
HOPEFULLY NOTHING
TERRIBLE HAPPENS TO US.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.451
ALL RIGHT.

04:58.490 --> 04:59.821
I THINK WE SHOULD
GO PRETTY FAR AWAY,

04:59.860 --> 05:01.657
YOU KNOW, SOMEPLACE
COMPLETELY OFF THE MAP.

05:01.700 --> 05:02.826
THAT WAY AT LEAST
YOU'LL BE SAFE

05:02.870 --> 05:04.497
WHILE WE FIGURE
THIS THING OUT.

05:04.530 --> 05:05.827
I SAY WE GO NORTH.

05:05.870 --> 05:06.791
- CAN YOU BE
A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC?

05:06.840 --> 05:08.796
- FINE, SOUTH.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.660
- WELL, IF YOU WANNA
GO OFF THE MAP

05:10.710 --> 05:11.699
YOU CAN
TAKE ME HOME.

05:11.740 --> 05:13.071
- TSK, I FEEL THAT.

05:29.730 --> 05:33.359
[gunshot]
[glass breaking]

05:35.700 --> 05:36.894
[cocks pistol]

05:40.940 --> 05:42.908
[gunshot]

05:49.880 --> 05:50.744
GO BACK INSIDE!

05:50.780 --> 05:52.441
ALL OF YOU!

05:52.480 --> 05:54.744
[sighs]

05:55.920 --> 05:58.844
[upbeat rock music]

05:58.890 --> 06:02.656
*

06:02.690 --> 06:03.782
* IN BETWEEN THE LINES

06:03.830 --> 06:06.492
* THERE'S A LOT
OF OBSCURITY *

06:06.530 --> 06:09.727
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

06:09.770 --> 06:11.021
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

06:11.070 --> 06:12.731
* THAN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

06:12.770 --> 06:15.432
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND

06:15.470 --> 06:18.439
* TO THE SAME DAMN SONG

06:18.470 --> 06:24.443
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN CRAWL *

06:24.480 --> 06:27.517
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

06:27.550 --> 06:29.484
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

06:29.520 --> 06:30.509
* THEY JUST
DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

06:30.550 --> 06:33.781
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION,
LEARN HOW TO BEND *

06:33.820 --> 06:35.879
* YOUR WORST AMBITIONS

06:35.920 --> 06:38.457
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

07:02.720 --> 07:03.687
- AAH.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.119
THAT'S VERY NICE.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.811
YOU LIVE ON A FARM.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.681
- NO, IT'S
MORE THAN A FARM.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.699
[scary music]

07:12.730 --> 07:15.949
*

07:16.000 --> 07:17.661
- GUS.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.567
[scary music]

07:20.600 --> 07:22.534
GUS, WE MAY HAVE A
CHILDREN OF THE CORN

07:22.570 --> 07:24.162
SITUATION HAPPENING HERE.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.837
- OH, COME ON, GUYS.

07:25.870 --> 07:27.838
DON'T YOU LIKE LOVE?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.848
- I LIKE LOVE.
- GUS.

07:29.880 --> 07:30.904
GUS, DRIVE! DRIVE!

07:30.950 --> 07:32.542
- THERE ARE PEOPLE AROUND.
- DRIVE THROUGH THEM!

07:32.580 --> 07:33.547
- THEY'RE SMILING.

07:33.580 --> 07:34.740
- FINE, THEY'LL DIE HAPPY.

07:34.780 --> 07:37.681
FLOOR IT!
NO, NICOLE! DON'T BE A HERO!

07:37.720 --> 07:38.641
GUS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:38.690 --> 07:39.816
NO! JUST--

07:39.860 --> 07:42.658
- WELCOME.

07:42.690 --> 07:43.952
OOH.

07:43.990 --> 07:46.857
WELCOME BACK, SISTER.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.561
- YOU TWO ARE SISTERS?

07:50.600 --> 07:54.889
- SURE, IN THAT WE ARE
ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS HERE.

07:54.940 --> 07:57.135
- AAH, ALL RIGHT.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.239
SO YOU'RE NOT--
NOT REALLY SISTERS.

07:58.270 --> 08:01.808
I MEAN YOU'RE "SISTERS,"
'CAUSE, UH, I WAS THROWN.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.068
BECAUSE THERE'S
REALLY NO RESEMBLANCE

08:03.110 --> 08:04.577
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.077
- SHAWN.
- WHAT--?

08:06.110 --> 08:07.270
- OH, WE WERE SO WORRIED.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.072
WE WERE SO WORRIED.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.214
WHEN YOU DIDN'T RETURN
FROM THE BUS STATION, I...

08:12.250 --> 08:13.581
- OH.
- OOOH.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.281
- WOW, OKAY.
- OOH.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.129
OH, YEAH,
WHEN ONE OF US IS GONE

08:17.160 --> 08:19.025
THE WHOLE BALANCE
IS OFF.

08:19.060 --> 08:20.129
I HAVEN'T BEEN
REGULAR ALL DAY,

08:20.160 --> 08:21.650
AND THAT'S JUST
NOT LIKE ME AT ALL.

08:21.700 --> 08:22.428
LISTEN, COME HERE,
I LOVE YOU.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.495
- HEY, NO, I'M GOOD.
- OH, NO?

08:23.530 --> 08:25.896
- YEAH, I'M GOOD.
YOU SHOULD EAT SOME ROUGHAGE.

08:25.930 --> 08:27.864
- I KNOW!
- MAYBE WE CAN HUG IT OUT LATER.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.209
- [laughs] I'D LOVE TO.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.800
- SO YOU GUYS
AREN'T RELATED TO CORN

08:32.840 --> 08:34.808
IN ANY WAY, SHAPE,
OR FORM?

08:34.840 --> 08:37.638
- WE LIKE TO THINK OF OURSELVES
AS AN INTENTIONAL COMMUNITY.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.614
LIVING TOGETHER IN PEACE

08:39.650 --> 08:40.719
AND CELEBRATING
OUR SHARED VALUES

08:40.750 --> 08:44.709
OF COOPERATION, NONVIOLENCE,
EQUALITY AND ECOLOGY.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.287
ALL UNDER THE LOVING GUIDANCE
AND LEADERSHIP OF ELI.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.753
[door creaks open]

08:48.790 --> 08:51.759
[spiritual music]

08:51.790 --> 08:57.763
*

08:57.800 --> 08:59.165
- WELCOME BACK, SISTER.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.963
- [laughs]

09:01.000 --> 09:03.639
- I TELL YOU PEOPLE,
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING

09:03.670 --> 09:04.739
AND RIGHT AWAY...

09:04.770 --> 09:06.203
SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.639
THERE WAS A JAGGEDNESS.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.635
WHO ELSE FELT IT?

09:08.680 --> 09:09.999
COME ON, NOW.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.938
I KNOW THIS GUY DID.
- [laughs]

09:11.980 --> 09:15.347
- I CAN SEE A GLORIOUS WIND
HAS BROUGHT BACK ONE OF OUR OWN.

09:15.380 --> 09:19.339
- ELI, I SAW SOMETHING
IN THE CITY.

09:19.390 --> 09:21.119
- SHE SAW A MURDER.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.718
- OH, LITTLE BIRD.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.648
MY POOR LITTLE BIRD.

09:24.690 --> 09:29.127
- I BLANKED, I FLIPPED,
I WAS COMPLETELY USELESS.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.969
- SHE WAS BRAVE
AND DREAMY.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.297
IF THAT MATTERS.

09:32.330 --> 09:35.037
- ARE THESE THE HEROES
WHO DELIVERED YOU SAFELY TO US?

09:35.070 --> 09:36.162
- MM-HMM.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.337
- I'M BURTON GUSTER,
I'M JUST A MAN.

09:37.370 --> 09:38.803
A MAN WHO CARES.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.307
WE THINK NICOLE
MIGHT BE IN DANGER.

09:40.340 --> 09:41.876
WE'D LIKE TO STAY
AND PROTECT HER.

09:41.910 --> 09:43.707
- UH, WE WOULD?
- YES.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.604
- THAT'S FUNNY, 'CAUSE
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

09:45.650 --> 09:47.618
THAT THIS WAS MORE
OF A DROP-OFF SITUATION.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.015
- NO, MM-MM.

09:49.050 --> 09:51.109
- SEE WE HAVE TICKETS
TO A SCREENING OF XANADU

09:51.150 --> 09:52.310
AT 5:50.

09:52.350 --> 09:55.114
I FEEL LIKE
A EUCALYPTUS TREE.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.219
- NORMALLY WE DON'T
TAKE IN STRANGERS.

09:57.260 --> 09:58.227
- PERFECT.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.091
- I...

10:00.130 --> 10:02.189
WOULD FEEL SAFER IF...

10:02.230 --> 10:05.324
THEY STAYED.

10:05.370 --> 10:09.329
- WELL, A BROTHER OF MY SISTER
IS A BROTHER OF MINE.

10:09.370 --> 10:11.702
SO WELCOME, BROTHERS.
- ALL RIGHT.

10:11.740 --> 10:12.809
- EVERYONE, WE HAVE GUESTS.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.832
[cheers and applause]

10:15.880 --> 10:19.646
[bell ringing]

10:19.680 --> 10:21.341
- WE'VE GOT
THREE SIMPLE RULES.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.382
KEEP YOUR MIND OPEN,
YOUR HEART PURE,

10:23.420 --> 10:24.409
AND YOUR PLATE FULL.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.145
- I HEAR THAT.
- [laughs]

10:26.190 --> 10:28.784
- I'M AFRAID I CAN'T ABIDE
BY THOSE STIFLING RESTRICTIONS.

10:28.820 --> 10:30.856
- OOH, LET'S EAT.

10:30.890 --> 10:32.721
LET'S EAT, HUH?
- LET'S EAT.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.692
- LET'S EAT!
- AH!

10:33.730 --> 10:37.359
[applause]

10:42.040 --> 10:44.304
- YOU DON'T FIND ANYTHING ODD
ABOUT THIS WHOLE SETUP?

10:44.340 --> 10:46.365
- NOT REALLY.

10:46.410 --> 10:48.002
- YOU'RE TOO TRUSTING.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.974
IT'S LIKE THAT TIME YOU BOUGHT
THAT DWARF ALL THOSE DRINKS

10:50.010 --> 10:51.807
IN THE ICE BAR 'CAUSE
HE TOLD YOU HE WAS A PRINCE.

10:51.850 --> 10:53.943
- NO, HE WAS
A PRINCE IN EXILE

10:53.980 --> 10:55.174
AND HE LOST HIS WALLET.

10:55.220 --> 10:56.073
- I'M TELLING YOU, MAN,
THERE'S SOMETHING

10:56.120 --> 10:57.314
SERIOUSLY STRANGE
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE.

10:57.350 --> 10:58.647
- LIKE WHAT?

11:03.760 --> 11:05.387
- LIKE MAYBE...

11:05.430 --> 11:06.419
IT'S A CULT.

11:12.430 --> 11:13.431
- OH, MY GOD.

11:13.470 --> 11:14.869
THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE OKAY.

11:14.900 --> 11:15.889
SHAWN, I'VE BEEN CALLING.

11:15.940 --> 11:18.738
- I GUESS WE WERE OUT OF RANGE.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:18.770 --> 11:20.806
- SHAWN, YOU WERE RIGHT,
SOMEBODY IS AFTER NICOLE.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.876
SOME LUNATIC SHOT UP
MY HOUSE LIKE AN HOUR AGO.

11:22.910 --> 11:24.446
MY PLACE
IS A CRIME SCENE.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.879
- HOLY CRAP.
JULES, ARE YOU OKAY?

11:25.910 --> 11:27.172
WE'RE COMING BACK RIGHT NOW.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.278
- NO, SHAWN, I AM FINE.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.845
I WASN'T THE TARGET,
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE NICOLE WAS.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.482
WE'VE EXTENDED AN APB
TO SURROUNDING COUNTIES.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.418
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.087
THE SHOOTER COULD
STILL BE IN THE AREA.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.382
PLEASE TELL ME YOU ARE
SOMEWHERE OUT OF THE WAY.

11:36.420 --> 11:37.853
- OH, YEAH, WE'RE
SO FAR OFF THE GRID

11:37.890 --> 11:39.380
I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY
BACK ON THE GRID.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.421
- OKAY, I WILL GET
A PROTECTIVE ORDER FOR THE GIRL.

11:41.460 --> 11:42.859
JUST KEEP HER SAFE
UNTIL LASSITER AND I

11:42.900 --> 11:44.720
CAN FIGURE THINGS OUT
ON THIS END, OKAY?

11:44.770 --> 11:45.964
I WILL SEND SOMEBODY OUT THERE
FOR YOU SOON.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.490
- OKAY, THERE'S
ONLY ONE PROBLEM.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.394
UH, WE DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHERE WE ARE.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.067
- GOOD.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.704
[crickets chirping]

11:55.780 --> 11:57.702
[rooster crows]

12:04.790 --> 12:08.851
[bell rings]

12:08.890 --> 12:11.051
- [coughs]

12:11.090 --> 12:12.125
OH, MY GOD.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.752
[rooster crows]

12:13.800 --> 12:15.859
I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE
WOULD BE UP AT THIS HOUR.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.868
NOT EVEN ANIMALS.
- MM-HMM.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.993
- ARE WE REALLY PROTECTING
A WITNESS IN A CULT?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.133
- IT'S NOT A CULT, SHAWN.

12:22.170 --> 12:24.502
THEY GROW THEIR OWN FOOD
AND MAKE KICK-ASS HAMMOCKS.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.098
YOU NEED TO
OPEN YOUR MIND.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.539
- MAN...

12:27.580 --> 12:29.172
YOU ARE IN COMPLETE DENIAL
BECAUSE YOU'RE

12:29.210 --> 12:30.472
SMITTEN WITH NICOLE.

12:30.510 --> 12:33.013
- OH, THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

12:33.050 --> 12:35.177
BUT I DO
LIKE THE GIRL, THOUGH.

12:35.220 --> 12:36.812
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
LISTEN TO ME, MAN.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.284
I GOTTA SAY THIS.
- MM-HMM.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.049
- YOU KNOW THAT I AM OKAY
WITH YOU DOING YOUR THING

12:41.090 --> 12:43.058
AND PUTTING
A LITTLE VIBE OUT THERE

12:43.090 --> 12:45.058
EVERY ONCE
IN A WHILE, BUT...

12:45.090 --> 12:46.455
[sighs]

12:46.490 --> 12:49.197
I THINK LATELY THINGS
ARE GETTING OUT OF HAND.

12:49.230 --> 12:51.061
- OH, NO IT'S NOT.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.931
- DUDE, YOU GAVE A NECKLACE
TO THE FED-EX GIRL LAST WEEK.

12:52.970 --> 12:55.234
- THAT'S BECAUSE SHE KEPT
STOPPING BY FOR NO REASON.

12:55.270 --> 12:57.864
- SHE KEPT STOPPING BY
TO DELIVER OUR FED-EX PACKAGES.

12:57.910 --> 12:59.207
- ALL RIGHT, FINE, FINE.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.571
MAYBE I WANT SOMEBODY SPECIAL
IN MY LIFE TOO,

13:00.610 --> 13:02.237
YOU EVER THINK OF THAT?

13:02.280 --> 13:04.373
AND IF PUTTING OUT A SLIGHTLY
STRONGER SIGNAL IS GONNA HELP,

13:04.410 --> 13:06.503
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING
I'M WILLING TO DO.

13:06.550 --> 13:08.575
- I'M NOT SURE
IT'S HELPING.

13:08.620 --> 13:10.383
- AGREE TO DISAGREE, SHAWN.

13:10.420 --> 13:15.357
[bell rings]

13:15.390 --> 13:16.550
- I CAN'T MOVE.

13:16.590 --> 13:19.127
- MMM, NEITHER CAN I.

13:19.160 --> 13:21.526
- LET'S PRETEND WE'RE DEAD.
- MM-MM.

13:21.560 --> 13:24.893
- HEY, IT'S MORNING RITUAL
DOWN BY THE PEACE ASH,

13:24.930 --> 13:28.832
SO I BROUGHT YOU GUYS
SOME FRESH CLOTHES.

13:28.870 --> 13:32.465
- WE ARE SO THERE.
- PEACE ASH?

13:35.140 --> 13:37.449
[cell phone beeps]

13:37.480 --> 13:39.402
[telephone rings]

13:39.450 --> 13:40.542
- HELLO?
- HELLO.

13:40.580 --> 13:42.275
- SHAWN, WHY
ARE YOU WHISPERING?

13:42.320 --> 13:44.880
- BECAUSE I HAVE TO, OKAY?

13:44.920 --> 13:45.944
I JUST--
LOOK, I JUST AM.

13:45.990 --> 13:47.514
- SUCH A WASTE OF TIME.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.949
- SHAWN, WE ARE STANDING HERE
ON NICOLE'S STREET CORNER

13:49.990 --> 13:52.379
AND THERE IS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

13:52.430 --> 13:53.454
I COULD REALLY
USE YOUR HELP RIGHT NOW.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.424
- LOOK, I CAN'T JUST
BE PSYCHIC ON DEMAND, OKAY?

13:56.460 --> 13:57.358
RIGHT NOW IT'S
ALL I CAN DO

13:57.400 --> 13:59.595
JUST TO CARRY THE TIGER
OVER THE MOUNTAIN.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.359
- COME ON, TELL
YOUR BOYFRIEND GOODBYE

14:01.400 --> 14:03.106
AND LET'S GO
GET SOME PANCAKES!

14:03.140 --> 14:05.165
- CLOUD HANDS.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.098
- THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL.

14:07.140 --> 14:08.300
- ISN'T IT?

14:08.340 --> 14:10.501
I USED TO BE
A TRUST FUND KID.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.519
NOTHING IN THE WORLD
MEANT ANYTHING TO ME.

14:13.550 --> 14:15.518
WHEN I SIGNED THE
PLEDGE OF SIMPLICITY,

14:15.550 --> 14:18.110
MY LIFE
SUDDENLY BECAME CLEAR.

14:18.150 --> 14:21.415
- I'M FINDING SOME
CLARITY MYSELF AND WHATNOT.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.951
[car horn honking]

14:27.230 --> 14:28.993
- SHAWN,
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING?

14:29.030 --> 14:30.429
I MEAN--

14:30.470 --> 14:31.425
WHOA!

14:31.470 --> 14:34.564
- HEY! IT'S A RED LIGHT!

14:34.600 --> 14:36.033
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

14:36.070 --> 14:40.370
- OH, SOME JACKASS
JUST BLEW THROUGH A RED LIGHT.

14:40.410 --> 14:45.507
- AND IT HAPPENED
RIGHT OVER THERE.

14:45.550 --> 14:48.439
- OKAY, LOOK, I'LL GET ON
THE PSYCHIC THING, ALL RIGHT?

14:48.480 --> 14:49.674
AND, UM,
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.518
- AND OPEN...

14:52.550 --> 14:55.383
AND CLOSE.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.081
EXCELLENT.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.119
BRING ON THE DAY!

14:58.160 --> 14:59.923
- [laughs]

14:59.960 --> 15:02.451
[applause]

15:08.170 --> 15:09.569
- I REALLY SHOULDN'T
BE DOING THIS, SHAWN.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.500
- YEAH, WELL, DAD,
I'M DESPERATELY TRYING

15:11.540 --> 15:13.599
TO DRUM UP
A PSYCHIC VISION HERE,

15:13.640 --> 15:16.177
SO A LITTLE HELP
WOULD BE NICE, OKAY?

15:16.210 --> 15:18.246
OOH!
OOH, WAIT.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.440
I CAN TOTALLY
SEE YOUR SCREEN.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.549
LIKE, I TOLD YOU
THIS WOULD WORK.

15:20.580 --> 15:22.070
- I TOLD YOU HOW TO DO IT.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.280
TWO MINUTES AGO,

15:23.320 --> 15:24.548
YOU DIDN'T EVEN THINK
IT WAS POSSIBLE.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.488
- OKAY, LISTEN,
I NEED TO SEE ANY PICTURES

15:25.520 --> 15:27.010
THE TRAFFIC-CAM
MAY HAVE TAKEN

15:27.060 --> 15:29.620
BETWEEN NOON AND 12:30.

15:29.660 --> 15:31.958
THAT'S WHEN NICOLE CLAIMED
TO HAVE SEEN THIS MURDER.

15:31.990 --> 15:35.221
AND THE VICTIM HAS A FACE,
A SUIT, AND A HEAW PRESENCE.

15:35.260 --> 15:37.319
- YOU KNOW IT'S A REAL LONG SHOT
THAT A CAR WOULD BLOW A LIGHT

15:37.370 --> 15:39.463
AT THE EXACT MOMENT
YOUR GUY WAS STANDING THERE.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.138
- DAD, JUST LOOK.

15:41.170 --> 15:42.535
OTHERWISE GUS
IS GOING TO END UP

15:42.570 --> 15:47.530
HANDING OUT LUNCH MEAT
AT AIRPORTS.

15:47.580 --> 15:53.439
- WAIT, WAIT.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.311
THIS MAY SOUND CRAZY,
BUT I KNOW THIS GUY.

15:55.350 --> 15:56.544
IT'S DAN COOPER.

15:56.580 --> 15:58.286
THIS GUY'S A COP.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.084
HE'S I.A.
- INTERNAL AFFAIRS?

16:01.120 --> 16:02.519
- YEAH, THAT'S HIM ALL RIGHT.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.482
HE'S A CRUSADER
WITH A CHIP ON HIS SHOULDER.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.725
HE'S PISSED OFF
A LOT OF COPS IN HIS TIME.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.625
- HM.

16:08.660 --> 16:09.649
- HEY.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.497
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
BE IN HERE.

16:11.530 --> 16:12.622
- UH...

16:12.670 --> 16:13.637
I KNOW THAT.

16:13.670 --> 16:14.762
NOW.

16:14.800 --> 16:19.635
IT'S A RULE, EH?

16:19.670 --> 16:22.400
- THAT'S THE MAN
I SAW KILLED.

16:27.650 --> 16:28.674
- ALL RIGHT,
CHECK IT OUT.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.119
THE GUY WHO
GOT KILLED

16:30.150 --> 16:32.539
WAS AN I.A. INVESTIGATOR
NAMED DAN COOPER.

16:32.590 --> 16:33.614
- MM.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.615
- I'M GUESSING
WHOEVER KILLED HIM

16:34.660 --> 16:36.059
WAS ONE OF THE OFFICERS
HE WAS INVESTIGATING.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.489
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW,

16:37.530 --> 16:39.555
INTERNAL AFFAIRS
ISN'T VERY POPULAR WITH COPS.

16:39.590 --> 16:41.319
I HAVE JULES
LOOKING INTO IT.

16:41.360 --> 16:45.194
- THESE PLUMS
ARE GOD'S CANDY.

16:45.230 --> 16:47.334
- OKAY, IF GOD MEANT
FOR THEM TO BE CANDY,

16:47.370 --> 16:48.564
THEN WHY DID
HE INVENT CANDY?

16:48.600 --> 16:50.602
HUH? DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I JUST SAID?

16:50.640 --> 16:51.732
- I'M TRYING
TO DO MY JOB.

16:51.770 --> 16:53.670
- YOUR JOB IS TO FIND OUT
WHO TRIED TO KILL NICOLE,

16:53.710 --> 16:55.132
NOT SELL APPLES.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.068
- SHAWN, YOU THINK
EVERY ROUND FRUIT IS AN APPLE.

16:57.110 --> 16:58.372
- NO, I DON'T.

16:58.410 --> 16:59.672
- OKAY.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.109
WHAT ARE THESE?
- TINY APPLES.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.117
- AND THOSE?

17:02.150 --> 17:03.139
- HALLOWEEN APPLES.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.487
- THESE BERRIES
ARE GREEN NOW,

17:04.520 --> 17:06.147
'CAUSE THEY'RE JUST
PULLED FROM THE VINE.

17:06.190 --> 17:09.318
BUT IN A FEW DAYS THEY'RE GONNA
BE THIS RIGHT, BEAUTIFUL RED.

17:09.360 --> 17:14.491
OH, TERRIFIC,
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

17:14.530 --> 17:17.522
- SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF WORK
FOR 75.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.629
- TRUST ME,
YOU TRY ROLLING CALLS

17:19.670 --> 17:22.093
TO YOUR HUNDRED CLIENTS
EXPLAINING WHY THE PLAINCO FUND

17:22.140 --> 17:23.801
IS SUDDENLY WORTH
HALF IT'S VALUE,

17:23.840 --> 17:25.569
AND YOU TELL ME
WHICH IS MORE REWARDING.

17:25.610 --> 17:27.077
- YOU WERE
A HEDGE FUND MANAGER?

17:27.110 --> 17:28.077
- OH, YEAH,
I WAS A PRETTY BIG ONE.

17:28.110 --> 17:30.203
YEAH, I HAD A BEACH HOUSE
IN ANTIGUA, AND--

17:30.250 --> 17:32.844
BUT NONE OF THAT
BUYS HAPPINESS.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.177
- HEH, NO WAY.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.642

17:35.680 --> 17:37.739
[laughs]
DOESN'T IT, GUS?

17:37.790 --> 17:39.439

17:39.490 --> 17:41.685
HOW ARE THINGS

THEIR REDNECK ASSES.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.118

SHH, BROTHER GUS.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.855
ELI HAS TAUGHT US
THAT THESE KIND OF PEOPLE

17:48.900 --> 17:53.291
NEED OUR LOVE,
NOT OUR FISTS.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.329
WE LOVE YOU.

17:54.370 --> 17:59.865
- YOU LOVE ME, HUH?

17:59.910 --> 18:04.609
EVEN IF I DID THIS?

18:04.650 --> 18:06.606
- YES, I DO.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.311

JUST FOR THE RECORD.

18:08.350 --> 18:10.580

AND YOU'RE LAURIE SINGER.

18:40.750 --> 18:41.819

AT INTERNAL AFFAIRS,

19:23.890 --> 19:25.221
SO THANKS FOR COMING.

19:25.260 --> 19:27.592

MARCH, BELIEVE ME.

19:27.630 --> 19:29.257
I DON'T WANNA BE SEEN
PALLING AROUND

19:29.300 --> 19:30.562
WITH THE HEAD
OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.828
- THAT'S FINE,
I DON'T NEED TO BE SEEN

19:31.870 --> 19:33.599
HANGING WITH
CARLTON LASSITER.

19:33.640 --> 19:34.959
- HA! YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.297
- WE KNOW YOU.

19:36.340 --> 19:37.534
BELIEVE ME.

19:37.570 --> 19:41.370
LISTEN THIS IS REGARDING ONE
OF YOUR OFFICERS, DAN COOPER.

19:41.410 --> 19:42.877
WE NEED TO KNOW WHO
HE WAS INVESTIGATING.

19:42.910 --> 19:44.502
- WHY WOULD I
TELL YOU THAT?

19:44.550 --> 19:45.869
- WELL, BECAUSE WE HAVE REASON
TO BELIEVE THAT ONE OF THEM

19:45.910 --> 19:47.548
MAY HAVE
JUST KILLED HIM.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.219
- I TALKED TO COOPER YESTERDAY.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.649
WHAT EVIDENCE
DO YOU HAVE?

19:51.690 --> 19:54.386
- WELL, TO BE HONEST
OUR EVIDENCE IS A LITTLE HAZY.

19:54.420 --> 19:55.580
- PURPLE HAZY.

19:55.620 --> 19:57.429
- OH, OKAY.

19:57.460 --> 19:58.882
WELL, WHEN IT BECOMES
A LITTLE LESS HAZY,

19:58.930 --> 19:59.885
CALL ME.

19:59.930 --> 20:01.522
I'LL CHECK ON COOPER.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.528
UNTIL THEN I'M NOT DISCLOSING
WHO HE WAS INVESTIGATING.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.299
- YOU LISTEN TO ME,
YOU LITTLE SNITCH.

20:05.330 --> 20:08.595
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU--
- CARLTON!

20:08.640 --> 20:11.666
LOOK, IF THERE'S ANYTHING
YOU CAN TELL US...

20:11.710 --> 20:13.905
- LOOK, COOPER
CHASED PAPER TRAILS.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.635
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS.

20:15.680 --> 20:17.944
IT'S NOT THE KIND OF STUFF
THAT MAKES REAL ENEMIES.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.004
AS FOR YOU, DETECTIVE,

20:19.050 --> 20:20.005
WE'LL BE WATCHING.

20:20.050 --> 20:21.244

20:21.280 --> 20:22.577
YOU DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING ON ME.

20:22.620 --> 20:26.545

A WEAPON IN A CIRCUS.

20:26.590 --> 20:27.818
TWICE.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.612
LAST YEAR YOU PUT
AN 86-YEAR-OLD SHOPLII-TER

IN FULL BODY RESTRAINTS.

20:30.660 --> 20:31.456
[cell phone rings]

20:31.490 --> 20:32.923
- THAT OLD LADY
WAS FEISTY AS HELL,

20:32.960 --> 20:33.995
AND I'VE GOT THE DENTURE MARKS
TO PROVE IT, BUB.

20:34.030 --> 20:36.021
- OH, NO.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.027
- WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

20:37.060 --> 20:38.596
- AM I MAKING YOU NERVOUS?

20:38.630 --> 20:39.562
- YOU'RE NOT
MAKING ME NERVOUS AT ALL.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.660
AM I MAKING YOU NERVOUS?

[cell phone rings]

20:47.810 --> 20:48.834

20:48.880 --> 20:50.507
WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE ANGRY TEXTS?

20:50.550 --> 20:53.314
- YOU BLEW YOUR COVER,
YOU'RE AT A HIPPIE FARM?

20:53.350 --> 20:55.545
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
- BOX CANYON.

20:55.580 --> 20:57.548
WE GOT A REPORT ON THE WIRE
THAT YOU TWO

20:57.590 --> 20:58.989
GOT INTO
A PHYSICAL ALTERCATION

20:59.020 --> 21:00.009
WITH SOME
OF THE LOCALS.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.608
WHAT IS THAT
RIDICULOUS SOUND?

21:01.660 --> 21:03.855
- THAT'S MY WASHBOARD, JULES.

21:03.890 --> 21:05.426
I'M WASHING MY BLOOMERS.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.553
ACTUALLY THEY'RE
NOT MINE PER SE,

21:07.600 --> 21:09.056
THEY'RE DOT'S.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.694
TRUTH BE TOLD,
THEY'RE COMMUNITY BLOOMERS.

21:11.730 --> 21:15.393
THESE PANTIES ARE OWNED
BY THE COLLECTIVE AS A WHOLE.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.998
CLEARLY ELI'S
OUT OF ORIGINAL IDEAS.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.962
- LOOK YOU GUYS ARE VULNERABLE,
THE PERSON LOOKING FOR NICOLE

21:19.010 --> 21:20.568
COULD KNOW THAT YOU
AND GUS ARE WITH HER.

21:20.610 --> 21:23.477
- WELL, WE DON'T
KNOW THAT FOR SURE, JULES.

21:23.510 --> 21:24.977
LOOK, DO YOU HAVE
ANY GOOD NEWS FOR ME?

21:25.010 --> 21:26.443
OR JUST
DOOM AND GLOOM STUFF?

21:26.480 --> 21:27.515
- DOOM AND GLOOM.

21:27.550 --> 21:29.541
WE HIT A DEAD END AT I.A.
WITH YOUR GUY COOPER.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.683
HE'S SMALL TIME.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.450
EVIDENCE-RELATED PAPERWORK,
LOGGING AND INVENTORY...

21:33.490 --> 21:35.708
- WAIT, LIKE,
EVIDENCE INVENTORY?

21:35.760 --> 21:37.648
- YEAH, WHY?

21:37.690 --> 21:39.681
- BRING ME BACK
A RED VELVET.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.339
- THE GUY WASN'T
HALF-ASSING HIS JOB.

21:47.370 --> 21:49.531
HE DIDN'T SIGN ON PURPOSE.

21:49.570 --> 21:51.663
UM, I'M GETTING SOMETHING!

21:51.710 --> 21:53.598
PIERCE--OFFICER PIERCE.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.108
I THINK THAT MAY BE THE COP
THAT COOPER WAS INVESTIGATING.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.641
- OKAY, WELL,
I WILL CHECK IT OUT.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.739
UNTIL THEN I NEED YOU
TO LAY LOW AND MAKE SURE

21:59.780 --> 22:00.769
THAT GUS DOES
THE SAME THING.

22:00.820 --> 22:01.639
- YEAH, WILL DO.

22:01.680 --> 22:06.344
AS SOON AS
I FIGURE OUT WHERE HE IS.

22:06.390 --> 22:07.357
- SHAWN!

22:07.390 --> 22:10.723
HI!

22:10.760 --> 22:13.422
- IT'S CREEPY.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.130
ELI, NICE HOUSE.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.398
CREEPY FAMILY,
BUT NICE HOUSE.

23:09.580 --> 23:13.550
[giggling, laughing]

23:19.660 --> 23:22.629

UH, BROTHER GUS?

23:25.930 --> 23:26.828
MAY I SPEAK
WITH YOU

23:26.870 --> 23:29.566
GENTLY BUT STERNLY
OUTSIDE ON THE PORCH?

23:29.600 --> 23:31.465
- SURE, BROTHER SHAWN.

23:31.510 --> 23:32.807
- GUS, WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

23:32.840 --> 23:34.137
- BROTHER SHAWN,
DON'T COME AT ME

23:34.180 --> 23:35.602
WITH ANGER
IN YOUR VOICE.

23:35.640 --> 23:36.971
- HEY,
KILL THE BROTHERS THING.

23:37.010 --> 23:38.477
- [sighs]
YOU WERE USING IT.

23:38.510 --> 23:39.670
- YEAH, AS A JOKE.
YOU'RE USING THEM FOR REAL.

23:39.710 --> 23:40.677
- I USE THEM
ALL THE TIME.

23:40.720 --> 23:41.675
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE
A BLACK GUY.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.176
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELI SAYS?

23:43.220 --> 23:45.745
THAT'S ANGER FROM PREVIOUS LIVES
THAT WAS NEVER SET FREE.

23:45.790 --> 23:48.088
- OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:48.120 --> 23:49.018
- IT MAKES SENSE.

23:49.060 --> 23:51.585
CLEAN LIVING
WITH HIGHER THINKING, SHAWN.

23:51.630 --> 23:52.585
I THINK THEY FOUND
A HIGHER WAY OF LIVING.

23:52.630 --> 23:54.723
- OKAY, STOP IT.
JUST STOP IT.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.591
YOU HAVE BEEN
SUCKED INTO THIS THING

23:56.630 --> 23:58.723
BECAUSE NICOLE IS PRETTY

23:58.770 --> 24:00.897
IN A KATE HUDSON
FROM ALMOST FAMOUS SORT OF WAY.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.737
AND YOU'RE YOU.

24:02.770 --> 24:05.603
- BURTON.
- OH, UH...

24:05.640 --> 24:06.709
DON'T BE JEALOUS, SHAWN.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.002
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.201
LOVE IS ABOUNDING
AND IS FOR EVERYONE.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.708
TRUE, NICOLE IS BEAUTIFUL.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.672
BUT SHE'S MERELY A VESSEL
FOR THAT LOVE.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.516
- RIGHT.

24:15.550 --> 24:17.142
- TRUE, THAT VESSEL
IS SMOKING HOT,

24:17.180 --> 24:19.080
AND SOMETIMES BATHES
IN AN OUTDOOR SHOWER.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.587
- REALLY?
- YES.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.588
BUT WE CANNOT
POSSESS LOVE, SHAWN.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.724
THAT KISS WAS NOT JUST
BETWEEN HER AND ME,

24:24.760 --> 24:25.727
IT WAS WITH EVERYONE.

24:25.760 --> 24:26.829
- RIGHT.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.851
I WOULD LEAVE YOU HERE,
BUT I OWE IT TO YOUR PARENTS

24:28.900 --> 24:29.855
TO SEE
THIS THING THROUGH.

24:29.900 --> 24:32.562
- BURTON.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.567
- UH...EH...

24:33.600 --> 24:36.694
I APPRECIATE THIS TALK, SHAWN.

24:36.740 --> 24:38.605
BUT IT'S TIME
TO GET TRANSCENDENTAL

24:38.640 --> 24:43.577
AND REJOICE IN
THE WONDER OF THE DAY.

24:43.610 --> 24:47.148
- WONDER OF THE--?

24:53.560 --> 24:56.950
[cell phone rings]

24:56.990 --> 24:58.685
HELLO?
- YOU WERE RIGHT, SHAWN.

24:58.730 --> 24:59.549
IT WAS PIERCE.

24:59.590 --> 25:01.956
WE CAUGHT HIM
IN POSSESSION OF DRUGS,

25:02.000 --> 25:02.955
STOLEN FROM EVIDENCE.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.228
- NO KIDDING.
- YEAH.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.623
WE GOT HIM
TO COP TO IT.

25:05.670 --> 25:06.796
HE TRIED TO
MAKE A RUN FOR IT

25:06.830 --> 25:07.899
BUT NOW
HE'S IN CUSTODY.

25:07.940 --> 25:08.895
HE'S BEEN DOING THIS
FOR MONTHS NOW,

25:08.940 --> 25:10.237
WORKING ALONE.

25:10.270 --> 25:11.999
LASSITER'S CONFIDENT
WE CAN GET HIM TO CONFESS

25:12.040 --> 25:13.302
TO THE MURDER
OF DAN COOPER,

25:13.340 --> 25:14.807
AND LEAD US
TO THE BODY.

25:14.840 --> 25:15.807
- YES!

25:15.840 --> 25:17.603
JULES, THIS IS AMAZING.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.708
IT MEANS I CAN GET
THE HELL OUT OF THIS PLACE.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.741
AND THAT GUS ISN'T GOING TO
END UP ROBBING A BANK

25:20.780 --> 25:22.270
IN A BERET
WITH A MACHINE GUN.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.548

25:31.790 --> 25:33.189
MY AURA SHIELD IS UP.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.619
WHICH MEANS
MY PRANA VAYU AND MY APANA VAYU

25:35.660 --> 25:37.059
ARE IN THE MIDST
OF HARMONIZING.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.728
CORRECTION: WERE IN
THE MIDST OF HARMONIZING.

25:39.770 --> 25:41.761
- MY BAD.
THAT'S MY BAD, CLEARLY.

I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR EARLIER

25:44.910 --> 25:48.004
AND TELL YOU THAT I TOO
COULD USE SOME HARMONY.

25:48.040 --> 25:51.749
SO WHY DON'T WE RENDEZVOUS
AT THE PEACE ASH,

25:51.780 --> 25:55.216
AND RECONNECT WITH OUR,
UH, SHOSHANNA LONSTEINS?

25:55.250 --> 25:56.672
- I DO LOVE ME
SOME PEACE ASH.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.688
- SEE?

25:58.720 --> 25:59.914
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.611
[chuckles]

26:01.660 --> 26:04.754
HEY, NICOLE,
BYE, NICOLE.

26:04.790 --> 26:06.621
LET'S GO.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.197
- I'M PRETTY SURE THE PEACE ASH
IS BACK THE OTHER WAY, SHAWN.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.730
- YEAH, WELL,
I'M TAKING A SHORTCUT.

26:18.770 --> 26:20.306
- DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
A SHORTCUT TO ME.

26:20.340 --> 26:22.672
- THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S A
SHORTCUT THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

26:22.710 --> 26:23.677
- WHAT?
- RIDICULOUS THING.

26:23.710 --> 26:24.642
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:24.680 --> 26:28.343
- WE'RE GOING HOME, GUS.
- YOU TRICKED ME.

26:31.820 --> 26:35.312
[tires squealing]

26:35.360 --> 26:38.124
- HEY, ISN'T THAT THE SAME CAR
THAT TRIED TO RUN DOWN NICOLE?

26:38.160 --> 26:40.048
- YES, BUT IT
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

26:40.090 --> 26:42.251
PIERCE IS IN CUSTODY.

26:42.300 --> 26:45.792
- THAT MEANS PIERCE
ISN'T THE KILLER.

26:45.830 --> 26:47.991
AND THE KILLER
JUST GOT HERE.

26:58.750 --> 27:02.413
- NICOLE! NICOLE!

27:02.450 --> 27:03.439
NICOLE!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:03.480 --> 27:05.846
TRYING TO SUMMON
EVERY NICOLE WITHIN 50 MILES?

27:05.890 --> 27:10.611
[water running]

27:16.760 --> 27:18.193
- ONE OF YOU GONNA
HAND ME A TOWEL?

27:18.230 --> 27:21.131
- SHE SEEMS FINE.
- YEAH.

27:21.170 --> 27:24.139
I'LL GET IT.
- OKAY.

27:29.240 --> 27:30.741
- OH, GOOD,
YOU MADE IT.

27:30.780 --> 27:31.678
- WE GOT HERE
AS SOON AS WE COULD.

27:31.710 --> 27:34.110
- THANK YOU.
- GREAT DIRECTIONS, SPENCER.

27:34.150 --> 27:35.879
IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FETID
STENCH OF UNWASHED HIPPIE PITS,

27:35.920 --> 27:37.717
WE MIGHT NEVER HAVE
FOUND THIS PLACE AT ALL.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.786
- WE ARE NOT HIPPIES, SIR.

27:39.820 --> 27:42.983
WE ENJOY THE SERENITY
OF ISOLATION, AND I WELCOME YOU.

27:43.020 --> 27:44.328
I'M ELI.

27:44.360 --> 27:46.157
YOU MAY CALL ME ELI.

27:46.190 --> 27:48.351
- THIS IS WHAT OUR TROOPS
HAVE BEEN FIGHTING TO PROTECT?

27:48.400 --> 27:50.027
THE RIGHT
NOT TO WEAR BRASSIERES?

27:50.060 --> 27:51.891
- YOU LIKE
WHAT YOU SEE, SLIM?

27:51.930 --> 27:54.091
- BACK OFF, SQUEAKY FROMME.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.789
SPENCER, WHERE'S THIS CAR
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?

27:55.840 --> 27:56.864
I DON'T WANNA SPEND
ONE MORE SECOND

27:56.900 --> 27:57.867
WITH THESE DO-NOTHINGS
THAN I HAVE TO.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.138
- WE'RE HARDLY DO-NOTHINGS.

27:59.170 --> 28:00.432
THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST
SUCCESSFUL MEMBERS

28:00.470 --> 28:02.802
OF YOUR MALFUNCTIONING SOCIETY
COME TOGETHER.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.808
AND THIS IS
A FULLY OPERATIONAL FARM.

28:04.850 --> 28:05.839
- OH, I'LL BET IT IS,
CHEECH.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.916
HOW ABOUT I BRING
SOME PALS DOWN FROM THE DEA.

28:07.950 --> 28:09.042
AND WE HELP
WITH THE HARVEST?

28:09.080 --> 28:12.481
[crowd booing, complaining]

28:12.520 --> 28:13.885
- SHUT UP.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.114
- IF WE'RE ALL DONE
MAKING FRIENDS HERE,

28:15.160 --> 28:16.218
WHY DON'T I
STAY WITH NICOLE

28:16.260 --> 28:17.727
AND YOU GUYS
GO CHECK OUT THE CAR?

28:17.760 --> 28:20.024
- GREAT.

28:20.060 --> 28:22.358
THANK YOU.

28:24.230 --> 28:27.358
- LOVE, LOVE, COME HERE,
COME HERE, COME, COME.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.890
- PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.999
THE KILLER'S HERE SOMEWHERE.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.359
GUS.

28:32.410 --> 28:33.968
all: [chanting] LOVE, LOVE,
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

28:34.010 --> 28:36.934
- GUS?
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

28:36.980 --> 28:39.039
all: [chanting] LOVE, LOVE,
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.071
- NO PLATES, NO REGISTRATION.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.042
HAVE TO RUN THE VIN
BY THE DMV.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.139
- GUS...

28:45.190 --> 28:46.384
CHECK OUT
THE TINY APPLES.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.887
- THE BERRIES ARE GREEN NOW

28:47.920 --> 28:49.114
'CAUSE THEY'RE
JUST PULLED FROM THE VINE.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.218
BUT IN A FEW DAYS
THEY'RE GONNA BE THIS

28:50.260 --> 28:52.319
BRIGHT, BEAUTIFUL RED.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.191
- RIPE AND READY TO EAT.

28:54.230 --> 28:56.095
- THAT MEANS THE KILLER
DIDN'T JUST GET HERE.

28:56.130 --> 28:57.768
HE'S BEEN HERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.028
- ELI, I'M GONNA
NEED TO INTERROGATE

28:59.070 --> 29:00.423
YOUR ENTIRE HERD
OF WEIRDOES.

29:00.470 --> 29:02.461
- YOU'RE GONNA
TREAT US ALL LIKE CRIMINALS?

29:02.500 --> 29:03.933
THERE IS
YOUR PROBLEM, SIR.

29:03.970 --> 29:05.858
COME WITH ME.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.332
I HAVE A MUCH MORE
EFFECTIVE CEREMONY

29:07.370 --> 29:08.769
WHICH ALL
MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS

29:08.810 --> 29:10.129
GATHER IN THE BARN...

29:10.180 --> 29:10.999
AND SPEAK THE TRUTH.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.972
- DARE I EVEN ASK
WHAT YOU CALL THIS

29:13.010 --> 29:15.547
FLOWERY GATHERING OF NONSENSE?

29:15.580 --> 29:16.911
- THE BARN OF TRUTH.

29:16.950 --> 29:19.919
[spiritual music]

29:19.950 --> 29:25.081
*

29:25.130 --> 29:28.896
[people conversing quietly]

29:28.930 --> 29:30.420
OKAY.

29:30.460 --> 29:32.223
I KNOW WE DON'T
DO THIS VERY Ol-TEN,

29:32.270 --> 29:34.534
BUT SOMETIMES WE NEED TO
PURGE OURSELVES OF OUR SECRETS.

29:34.570 --> 29:36.128
MAYBE SOME LIES.

29:36.170 --> 29:38.468
SO LET'S KEEP IT LOOSE,

29:38.510 --> 29:40.205
SPEAK FREELY,

29:40.240 --> 29:42.071
GET IT ALL
OUT IN THE OPEN.

29:42.110 --> 29:43.509
THEN GET TOGETHER
FOR A COMMUNITY HUG,

29:43.540 --> 29:45.906
AND SEND THESE OUTSIDERS
ON THEIR WAY.

29:45.950 --> 29:49.010
MILOSH, MY MAN, "THE GOURD
OF TRANSPARENCY" PLEASE.

29:53.050 --> 29:54.358
THIS IS
YOUR LEI-T SHOE, MILOSH.

29:54.390 --> 29:55.880
THE GOURD.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.353
I NEED THE GOURD.

29:57.390 --> 30:00.086
- OOPS.

30:00.130 --> 30:03.054
- OKAY.

30:03.100 --> 30:04.328
THANK YOU.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.565
REMEMBER,
IF YOU WANT THE FLOOR,

30:06.600 --> 30:08.591
YOU MUST
HOLD THE GOURD.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.961
NOW WHO'D LIKE TO
GET SOMETHING OFF THEIR CHEST?

30:11.010 --> 30:13.035
- [giggling] I DO.

30:13.070 --> 30:14.935
- THIS IS BEYOND RIDICULOUS.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.175
- THANK YOU, HI.

30:17.210 --> 30:21.544
I HAVE HAD A SERIES OF
DELICIOUSLY IMPURE DREAMS,

30:21.580 --> 30:24.083
WHERE I'M DUMPING OUT

30:24.120 --> 30:26.611
COLD BUTTER,
SUGAR, RAW EGGS,

30:26.650 --> 30:28.880
FLOUR, AND CHOCOLATE CHIPS

30:28.920 --> 30:32.128
ALL OVER THE EXPOSED BODY
OF THAT MAN.

30:36.930 --> 30:38.295
- THIS IS
A ROUGH MOMENT FOR ME.

30:38.330 --> 30:41.538
- WE HAVE A HISTORY.
- THAT'S NOT--[laughs]

30:41.570 --> 30:42.491
- HE WASHED MY BLOOMERS.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.464
- UH, OKAY--
THEY WERE COMMUNITY BLOOMERS.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.978
I TOLD YOU THAT ON--
- HMM.

30:48.010 --> 30:48.977
- ON THE PHONE.

30:49.010 --> 30:50.102
AND I WAS ASSIGNED
THOSE BLOOMERS

30:50.140 --> 30:52.199
AS A WORK ASSIGNMENT
FROM--FROM ELI.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.877
- THEY WERE SO CLEAN.
[laughs]

30:53.920 --> 30:55.148
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

30:55.180 --> 30:56.442
- THAT WAS GREAT.
- THERE YOU GO.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.516
- THANK YOU,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

30:58.550 --> 31:00.188
OKAY, VERY GOOD.

31:00.220 --> 31:00.914
ANYONE ELSE?

31:00.960 --> 31:03.929
- I'D LIKE TO
GIVE IT A GO.

31:03.960 --> 31:07.088
THANK YOU, ELI.

31:07.130 --> 31:09.155
[clears throat]

31:09.200 --> 31:12.124
UH, I HAVE TO
TELL THE TRUTH, NICOLE.

31:12.170 --> 31:14.161
WHEN YOU
WENT TO SANTA BARBARA,

31:14.200 --> 31:15.895
UH, I KNOW YOU
WEREN'T GOING SHOPPING

31:15.940 --> 31:17.396
FOR BOBBINS
THE OTHER DAY.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.603
I KNOW YOU WERE
GONNA SEE A MAN.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.471
- [nervous laugh]

31:22.510 --> 31:24.148
OKAY.

31:24.180 --> 31:25.044
UH, WELL...

31:25.080 --> 31:27.913
ACTUALLY,
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT AT ALL.

31:27.950 --> 31:30.418
UM, WE EXCHANGED NOTES,

31:30.450 --> 31:32.315
BUT WE NEVER ACTUALLY MET.

31:32.350 --> 31:35.012
I GOT THERE--I GOT THERE
HALF AN HOUR EARLY

31:35.060 --> 31:36.687
AND THEN I SAW
THAT TERRIBLE THING HAPPEN,

31:36.720 --> 31:37.687
SO WE NEVER EVEN--

31:37.720 --> 31:39.551
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT SHE
WENT TO THE COMPUTER,

31:39.590 --> 31:40.989
I READ HER EMAILS.

31:41.030 --> 31:42.918
- OKAY, WELL, ALL
HE WANT--NO, ACT UALLY--

31:42.960 --> 31:43.927
I HAVE THE GOURD.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.323
ALL HE WANTED TO DO
WAS TALK.

31:45.370 --> 31:46.689
- OH, REALLY?

31:46.730 --> 31:47.697
GIVE ME THE DAMN GOURD.

31:47.730 --> 31:49.288
OH, BECAUSE I'M SURE

31:49.340 --> 31:53.037
THAT LOU DIRISH @TFI.COM

31:53.070 --> 31:55.038
WAS SIMPLY GONNA DRIVE
INTO THE CITY TO CHAT IT UP

31:55.080 --> 31:55.830
IN AN ALLEY!

31:55.880 --> 31:57.029
- OKAY, THE TRUTH--
- OF COURSE!

31:57.080 --> 31:58.069
- OKAY, TRUTH, TRUTH.

31:58.110 --> 31:58.974
THE TRUTH IS,

31:59.010 --> 32:01.615
MAYBE I DO MISS
THE OUTSIDE WORLD, OKAY?

32:01.650 --> 32:03.174
BUT ALL HE
WANTED TO DO WAS

32:03.220 --> 32:05.108
ASK ME QUESTIONS
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

32:05.150 --> 32:06.117
THAT'S IT.

32:06.150 --> 32:07.981
IF YOU REALLY
NEED TO KNOW,

32:08.020 --> 32:09.112
OKAY?

32:09.160 --> 32:11.082
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
- OKAY, OKAY.

32:11.130 --> 32:11.983
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT HE WANTED.

32:12.030 --> 32:13.349
WHAT HE WANTED WAS
TO WALK IN WITH YOU,

32:13.390 --> 32:14.948
EACH OTHER'S HAND
IN YOUR BACK POCKETS--

32:15.000 --> 32:16.058
- OKAY, OKAY, VERY GOOD.

32:16.100 --> 32:17.055
- THAT'S WHAT
HE WAS LOOKING FOR.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.021
- NO.
- OH, I READ THE EMAIL!

32:18.070 --> 32:19.628
- I HAVE THE GOURD.
- SHHHH!

32:19.670 --> 32:21.069
- I HAVE THE GOURD.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.169
OKAY, THAN KS,
THAT'S GREAT.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.339
MAYBE WHEN WE GET TWO GOURDS
WE CAN WORK THAT OUT.

32:24.370 --> 32:26.065
THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING,
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.578
REALLY PUTTING IT
ALL OUT ON THE TABLE.

32:28.610 --> 32:30.430
YOU WENT TO
MEET A MAN,

32:30.480 --> 32:32.004
BUT DIDN'T.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.369
WE MOVE ON.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.139
THAT EMAIL ADDRESS--
- HOLD UP.

32:35.180 --> 32:36.317
IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK,

32:36.350 --> 32:37.988
YOU HAVE TO
SCORE THE GOURD.

32:38.020 --> 32:39.044
- YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

32:39.090 --> 32:41.581
- I NEVER KID.

32:41.620 --> 32:44.180
- OH, SHUT UP.

32:44.230 --> 32:47.358
THAT EMAIL ADDRESS, IT...

32:47.390 --> 32:49.153
BELONGED TO DAN COOPER.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.020
I SAW IT IN HIS
INTERNAL AFFAIRS FILE.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.128
- THAT MEANS...

32:52.170 --> 32:54.297
THE MAN THAT NICOLE
WENT TO VISIT IS THE SAME MAN

32:54.340 --> 32:56.035
THAT SHE SAW KILLED.

32:56.070 --> 32:58.334
- WHAT?
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

32:58.370 --> 33:01.635
HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT BEING A POLICE OFFICER.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.136
HE DIDN'T.

33:03.180 --> 33:05.102
[sighs]

33:09.120 --> 33:12.089
[all speaking at once]

33:13.520 --> 33:15.010
- DEAD MAN WAS A COP.

33:15.060 --> 33:16.482
- I HAD NO IDEA.

33:16.520 --> 33:18.420
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

33:18.460 --> 33:21.054
HE FOUND MY FACEBOOK PAGE.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.124
- REALLY?

33:22.160 --> 33:23.149
THAT'S FUNNY,
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS

33:23.200 --> 33:24.189
DIDN'T HAVE
STUFF LIKE THAT.

33:24.230 --> 33:27.358
- WE DON'T,
IT'S SORT OF A SECRET.

33:27.400 --> 33:29.197
- DID YOU CHANGE YOUR
RELATIONSHIP STATUS?

33:29.240 --> 33:31.208
- COOPER WAS HIS NAME.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.468
- HE REACHED OUT TO ME.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.375
HE SAID HE HAD QUESTIONS
ABOUT MY LIFE HERE,

33:34.410 --> 33:37.379
LIKE, MAYBE HE WAS LOOKING FOR
SOMETHING MISSING IN HIS LIFE.

33:37.410 --> 33:38.707
I UNDERSTOOD THAT, YOU KNOW?

33:38.750 --> 33:40.638
HE WAS SWEET...

33:40.680 --> 33:41.772
LIKE BURTON.

33:41.820 --> 33:43.811
- HEH,
THAT'S HOW I DO IT.

33:43.850 --> 33:44.942
- HE NEVER SENT ME
A PHOTO OF HIMSELF.

33:44.990 --> 33:48.209
WE SET UP A PLACE TO MEET,
HE SAID HE WOULD FIND ME.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.659
THEN I SAW THE MURDER

33:49.690 --> 33:52.079
AND I FLED.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.222
I NEVER THOUGHT
IT WAS THE SAME PERSON.

33:53.260 --> 33:55.251
THAT'S THE TRUTH,
I SWEAR IT.

33:55.300 --> 33:56.722
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS?

33:56.760 --> 34:00.366
- BECAUSE IT'S COMPLICATED,
PEOPLE MIGHT GET THE WRONG IDEA.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.061
- RIGHT.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.829
- I KNOW THAT SHE
WENT TO THE COMPUTER,

34:03.870 --> 34:05.235
I READ HER EMAILS.

34:05.270 --> 34:07.238
- YOU'RE PRETTY CUTE, SUNSHINE.

34:07.270 --> 34:08.237
- UNH!

34:08.280 --> 34:10.077
- I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

34:10.110 --> 34:11.179
I SENSE THAT
YOU AND JEFF

34:11.210 --> 34:13.098
HAVE A
PREVIOUS RELATIONSHIP.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.072
- YES, WE WERE MARRIED.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.270
HE'S MY EX-HUSBAND.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.287
- AH, SHE WAS MARRIED.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.242
- I JUST HEARD
"WERE" AND "EX."

34:20.290 --> 34:21.484
- I LEI-T HIM
TWO YEARS AGO

34:21.520 --> 34:22.817
AND I MOVED ON.

34:22.860 --> 34:23.849
BUT HE NEVER DID.

34:23.890 --> 34:25.551
- I'M ALSO SENSING

34:25.590 --> 34:27.319
THAT HE IS JEALOUS ENOUGH
TO HAVE FOLLOWED YOU

34:27.360 --> 34:28.429
INTO THE CITY

34:28.460 --> 34:30.291
AND MURDERED THE MAN
HE SUSPECTED YOU WERE SEEING.

34:30.330 --> 34:32.594
- I THINK I KNOW WHERE
WE'RE GOING NEXT.

34:32.630 --> 34:35.133
WHERE'S JEFF'S HUT?

34:38.240 --> 34:40.708
[knock on door]

34:40.740 --> 34:43.208
[sighs]

34:44.380 --> 34:46.302
- OH, HI,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

34:46.350 --> 34:49.376
- YOU GOT ANY PROBLEM
WITH US SEARCHING YOUR HOVEL?

34:49.420 --> 34:50.375
- NO.
NOT AT ALL.

34:50.420 --> 34:51.887
PLEASE--WHY WOULD I?

34:51.920 --> 34:53.888
- WELL, THEN
STEP ASIDE, GANDHI.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.457
- OH, VISION OF DARKNESS!

34:56.490 --> 34:58.856
SHED SOME LIGHT
ON THE DARK...

34:58.890 --> 35:00.585
SHED!

35:00.630 --> 35:01.790
MMM...

35:01.830 --> 35:03.718
CHECK THE SHED.

35:03.760 --> 35:06.297
- O'HARA, EYES ON HIM.
- OH, BOY.

35:06.330 --> 35:08.161
- CAN I GET ANYTHING FOR YOU?
- NOPE.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.236
NOT YOU, NOPE.

35:10.270 --> 35:12.363
- STAY THERE.

35:18.210 --> 35:21.373
THAT'S COOPER.

35:28.890 --> 35:30.050
- PLEASE! THIS IS
A HORRIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING!

35:30.090 --> 35:32.627
- YOU LITTLE TREE-HUMPERS
ARE ALL THE SAME, AREN'T YOU?

35:32.660 --> 35:34.150
YOU PROFESS TO BE
SAVING THE WORLD

35:34.200 --> 35:35.258
BUT DEEP DOWN,
YOU'RE ALL JUST

35:35.300 --> 35:37.222
A BUNCH OF
FREEDOM-HATING MURDERERS.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.363
- NO, NO--ACK!

35:38.400 --> 35:40.868
I LIKE FREEDOM!

35:40.900 --> 35:42.197
ELI!

35:42.240 --> 35:44.936
- GET YOUR FEET
OFF THE SEAT!

35:44.970 --> 35:46.733
- SO JEFF KILLED COOPER

35:46.770 --> 35:49.307
JUST BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
HE WAS SEEING HIS EX-WIFE?

35:49.340 --> 35:50.534
- WELL, THE HEART CAN
MAKE YOU BELIEVE

35:50.580 --> 35:51.774
SOME PRETTY CRAZY THINGS.

35:51.810 --> 35:52.777
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GUS?

35:52.810 --> 35:54.243
- PFFI', BROTHER SHAWN,

35:54.280 --> 35:55.713
FOR THE LAST TIME,

35:55.750 --> 36:00.187
MY SUPPORT FOR THIS COMMUNITY
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH NICOLE.

36:00.220 --> 36:04.281
- WHO'S THAT, COOPER'S WIFE?
- NO, COOPER WAS SINGLE.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.298
- I'M SENSING THIS WOMAN
USED TO LIVE HERE.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.695
- OH, HER NAME
IS CYNTHIA COOPER.

36:16.740 --> 36:18.833
WE WERE THE FIRST WOMEN
TO JOIN THIS COMMUNITY

36:18.870 --> 36:21.430
ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.902
WE WERE LIKE SISTERS.

36:22.940 --> 36:23.929
- WHAT HAPPENED?

36:23.980 --> 36:24.878
- SIX YEARS BACK

36:24.910 --> 36:26.946
SHE WOKE UP
AND DECIDED SHE HAD ENOUGH.

36:26.980 --> 36:28.868
I GUESS SHE
MISSED HER FAMILY

36:28.920 --> 36:31.218
AND HER LUXURIES
OF THE OLD LIFE.

36:31.250 --> 36:32.979
- WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING
TO THESE STINKY FLAG-BURNERS?

36:33.020 --> 36:34.385
WE'VE ALREADY
GOT THE BAD GUY.

36:34.420 --> 36:35.489
- CARLTON, REALLY?

36:35.520 --> 36:36.487
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"THE OLD LIFE?"

36:36.520 --> 36:39.489
- SHE WAS A PROMISING OB-GYN.

36:39.530 --> 36:42.249
- I WAS A HEDGE FUND MANAGER,
AND A PRETTY BIG ONE.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.928
- I USED TO BE
A TRUST-FUND KID.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.289
- WHERE'S CYNTHIA NOW?

36:46.330 --> 36:47.866
- I'VE BEEN
SEARCHING FOR HER MYSELF,

36:47.900 --> 36:50.789
BUT LAST I HEARD SHE WAS
LIVING IN A TRAILER PARK.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.239
AND HAD BECOME
MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

36:52.270 --> 36:53.703
- ALL RIGHT, I'M
GETTING SOMETHING HERE.

36:53.740 --> 36:56.709
BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOU GUYS
TO MAKE SOME PHONE CALLS.

36:56.740 --> 37:00.449
YOU'RE SO VERY
CLOSE TO ME, IT'S...

37:00.480 --> 37:03.449
[spiritual music]

37:03.480 --> 37:07.348
*

37:07.390 --> 37:08.982
- EXCELLENT.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.784
YOUR EMPATHY TRANSPORT
SHOULD BE WELL TONIFIED.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.957
- HEH.

37:13.990 --> 37:16.254
- NOW FOR OUR NEXT EXERCISE
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A PARTNER.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.995
WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE MINE?
- OOH! OOH! ME!

37:18.030 --> 37:19.793
ME, I WANNA
BE YOUR PARTNER.

37:19.830 --> 37:21.866
- ALL RIGHT.
- PLEASE!

37:21.900 --> 37:23.538
BUT FIRST,

37:23.570 --> 37:25.868
I'D LIKE TO TRY
A LITTLE EXERCISE OF MY OWN.

37:25.910 --> 37:26.831
IT'S CALLED,

37:26.870 --> 37:29.270
RAISE YOUR HAND
IF YOU'RE A SWINDLING CROOK

37:29.310 --> 37:30.732
PRETENDING TO BE
A SPIRITUAL LEADER!

37:30.780 --> 37:32.509
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

37:32.550 --> 37:34.006
- LET ME
ASK YOU ALL A QUESTION.

37:34.050 --> 37:35.415
WHO HERE,
OTHER THAN MILOSH,

37:35.450 --> 37:37.042
WASN'T MAKING
A TON OF DOUGH

37:37.080 --> 37:39.742
BEFORE JOINING
THIS COMMUNITY?

37:39.790 --> 37:40.814
GUS...

37:40.850 --> 37:42.283
- YOU ACTUALLY
JOINED THIS FREAK SHOW?

37:42.320 --> 37:43.457
- NO.

37:43.490 --> 37:45.958
BUT I AIN'T MAD
AT THE IDEA OF IT.

37:45.990 --> 37:48.424
- OF COURSE EVERYONE HERE
WAS WEALTHY,

37:48.460 --> 37:50.052
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY CAME TO ME?

37:50.100 --> 37:51.761
WEALTH CREATES UNHAPPINESS.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.995
- DID THEY REALLY
JUST COME TO YOU, ELI?

37:54.030 --> 37:55.759
REALLY?

37:55.800 --> 37:59.031
UPON ARRIVAL, YOU ALL SIGN
THIS PIECE OF PAPER, CORRECT?

37:59.070 --> 38:00.560
- YEAH, IT'S
A PLEDGE OF SIMPLICITY.

38:00.610 --> 38:02.908
- RIGHT, IT'S A
CAREFULLY WORDED DOCUMENT

38:02.940 --> 38:04.749
THAT GIVES ELI HERE
POWER OF ATTORNEY.

38:04.780 --> 38:06.668
WHICH MEANS HE
NOW OWNS EVERYTHING

38:06.710 --> 38:08.439
THAT USED TO
BELONG TO YOU.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.016
- DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

38:10.050 --> 38:12.018
HE IS A SLAVE
TO HIS OWN CYNICISM.

38:12.050 --> 38:13.688
- I'M A SLAVE
TO LOVE, JACK.

38:13.720 --> 38:16.484
AND FASHION, AND MOVIES
WHERE DOGS COVER THEIR EYES

38:16.520 --> 38:18.385
WHEN COUPLES
GET INTIMATE AROUND THEM.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.579
- NICOLE.

38:19.630 --> 38:20.983
THAT MAN YOU WENT
TO MEET THAT DAY,

38:21.030 --> 38:22.588
HIS NAME WAS DAN COOPER.

38:22.630 --> 38:24.894
HE WAS A COP,
AND HE WAS MURDERED BY ELI,

38:24.930 --> 38:26.522
NOT YOUR EX-HUSBAND.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.026
COOPER WAS THE ONE GUY

38:28.070 --> 38:29.469
THAT KNEW
WHAT ELI WAS UP TO.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.967
HIS SISTER
CYNTHIA COOPER

38:31.000 --> 38:32.069
USED TO LIVE HERE,
FOR YEARS.

38:32.110 --> 38:32.906
- IT'S TRUE.

38:32.940 --> 38:34.976
SHE WAS HERE
BEFORE ALL YOUR TIME.

38:35.010 --> 38:36.773
- BUT THEN SHE LEI-T.

38:36.810 --> 38:37.777
AND SHE DISCOVERED
SHE WAS RUINED,

38:37.810 --> 38:38.902
AND WAS NEVER THE SAME.

38:38.950 --> 38:42.010
AND THAT IS WHEN COOPER
DECIDED TO START BUILDING A CASE

38:42.050 --> 38:43.517
AGAINST THE MAN RESPONSIBLE.

38:43.550 --> 38:44.482
- HE'S RIGHT.

38:44.520 --> 38:45.839
WE CONFIRMED IT
WITH HIS BOSS.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.983
- THAT'S WHY COOPER
REACHED OUT TO YOU, NICOLE.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.487
PRETENDING TO BE
A LOST SOUL.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.680
- YOU MEAN
ALL HE WANTED

38:50.720 --> 38:52.449
WAS INFORMATION
ABOUT THE COMMUNE?

38:52.490 --> 38:53.650
- THAT'S CORRECT.

38:53.690 --> 38:54.657
THOUGH IF HE HAD
ACTUALLY MET YOU,

38:54.700 --> 38:58.818
I SUSPECT HE WOULD HAVE
WANTED MUCH, MUCH MORE.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.394
ELI DID HIS HOMEWORK.

39:00.430 --> 39:01.499
HE KNEW THAT COOPER
WAS ON TO HIM

39:01.540 --> 39:02.598
SO HE TRACKED HIM DOWN

39:02.640 --> 39:05.029
AND KILLED HIM
IN COLD BLOOD.

39:05.070 --> 39:06.037
THE ONE THING
HE WASN'T EXPECTING

39:06.070 --> 39:09.938
WAS YOU, NICOLE,
WITNESSING THE WHOLE THING.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.129
AND THAT WAS
A HELL OF A SURPRISE,

39:11.180 --> 39:12.772
SO HE HAD TO ACT FAST.

39:12.810 --> 39:14.004
HE THOUGHT HE HAD YOU.

39:14.050 --> 39:15.779
BUT THEN HE WAS
BLINDSIDED AGAIN.

39:15.820 --> 39:19.085
[gunshot]

39:20.120 --> 39:21.417
DID CATCH ONE BREAK.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.552
NICOLE DIDN'T GET
A GOOD ENOUGH LOOK

39:22.590 --> 39:23.659
TO KNOW
IT WAS HIM.

39:23.690 --> 39:24.884
AND WHEN SHE RETURNED,

39:24.930 --> 39:26.659
HE KNEW HIS
SECRET WAS SAFE.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.150
LOOK AT HOW I LIVE.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.895
WHAT WOULD I DO
WITH ALL THIS WEALTH

39:31.930 --> 39:32.919
YOU THINK
THAT I'M STEALING?

39:32.970 --> 39:35.131
- OH, I DON'T KNOW,
FLEE THE COUNTRY PERHAPS?

39:35.170 --> 39:37.764
- YOU APPLIED FOR
A US. PASSPORT LAST TUESDAY.

39:37.800 --> 39:38.607
- SO?

39:38.640 --> 39:39.937
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT,
BY THE WAY?

39:39.970 --> 39:40.834
- YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE

39:40.870 --> 39:43.009
AROUND HERE
WHO SEES THINGS, BROTHER.

39:43.040 --> 39:45.543
HE WAS PLANNING ON TAKING
ALL THE STUFF HE STOLE FROM YOU,

39:45.580 --> 39:47.969
AND FLEEING
TO BEAUTIFUL ANTIGUA.

39:48.010 --> 39:49.011
TO LIVE IN THE HOUSE
THAT HE NOW OWNS,

39:49.050 --> 39:50.017
COURTESY OF JEFF.

39:50.050 --> 39:55.454
- ELI, IS THIS TRUE?

39:55.490 --> 39:59.779
- OF COURSE NOT, MILOSH.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.183
- NOOO!

40:01.230 --> 40:03.824
- I DEVOTED
MY LIFE TO YOU!

40:03.860 --> 40:05.566
- SHOULD I
SHOOT HIM IN THE LEG?

40:05.600 --> 40:06.965
- NO.
DOT'S GOT MAD WHEELS.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.891
[people yelling angrily]

40:10.940 --> 40:13.829
- UNH!

40:13.870 --> 40:15.679
- UH, SHAWN?

40:15.710 --> 40:16.802
WHY AM I
WEARING MALA BEADS

40:16.840 --> 40:17.875
AROUND MY NECK?

40:17.910 --> 40:19.707
- HEH,
'CAUSE YOU'RE A FOOL.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.149
- ARE YOU EVER GONNA LET ME
FORGET ABOUT THIS?

40:21.180 --> 40:22.977
- NO, I'M NOT.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.817
- AAAH!
- THAT'S GONNA LEAVE A MARK.

40:28.990 --> 40:30.480
- MMM...

40:30.520 --> 40:35.856
- MM, THAT'S
FOR BELIEVING ME.

40:35.900 --> 40:38.095
AND THAT'S FOR
SAVING MY LIFE.

40:38.130 --> 40:40.018
_ UM--
- I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

40:40.070 --> 40:41.560
- MISS ME?

40:41.600 --> 40:42.669
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:42.700 --> 40:44.190
- I'M OFF TO INDIA.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.730
- WHAT?
FOR HOW LONG?

40:45.770 --> 40:48.773
- WELL, I KINDA BOUGHT
A ONE-WAY TICKET.

40:48.810 --> 40:50.835
OH, I JUST HAD
THE MOST AMAZING IDEA.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.008
COME WITH ME!
- UM, WHAT DO WE DO IN INDIA?

40:54.050 --> 40:57.178
- WE'LL MEDITATE,
ALIGN OUR CHAKRAS,

40:57.220 --> 40:58.949
GET IN TOUCH
WITH OUR INNER LIGHT.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.049
OH, AND YOU'LL
GET TO MEET RAMA MURTHY.

41:01.090 --> 41:02.648
HE'S INCREDIBLE.

41:02.690 --> 41:03.850
- WHO'S RAMA MURTHY?

41:03.890 --> 41:06.256
- HE'S INCREDIBLE.
- YOU SAID THAT ALREADY.

41:06.290 --> 41:08.554
- THE THREE OF US
WILL BASK IN GOLDEN LIGHT

41:08.600 --> 41:11.091
AND LIBERATE
OUR INHIBITIONS.

41:11.130 --> 41:14.099
- UM, ARE YOU CRAZY?

41:14.130 --> 41:16.064
- LOVE WILL ABOUND, GUS.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.533
- MY LOVE DOESN'T
ABOUND LIKE THAT.

41:17.570 --> 41:20.801
- BUT IT CAN.
- BUT IT WON'T.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.172
HOW ABOUT I CHECK YOU
WHEN YOU GET BACK?

41:23.210 --> 41:26.099
- I'LL LOOK
FORWARD TO THAT.

41:31.250 --> 41:33.138
- THIS IS AN
AWFULLY LONG WAY TO COME

41:33.190 --> 41:34.612
FOR A
PIECE OF FRUIT, SHAWN.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.753
- YOU'LL SOON UNDERSTAND, JULES.

41:36.790 --> 41:38.758
I SAW HOW TIRELESSLY
YOU WORKED TO MAKE SURE

41:38.790 --> 41:40.621
THAT THESE PEOPLE
GOT EVERYTHING BACK

41:40.660 --> 41:41.627
THAT WAS
STOLEN FROM THEM.

41:41.660 --> 41:43.025
- SO WHAT DOES
THAT HAVE TO--

41:43.060 --> 41:44.027
- SO...

41:44.060 --> 41:46.062
YOU GET YOUR REWARD.

41:50.200 --> 41:52.566
- OH, MY GOD.
- YES.

41:52.610 --> 41:53.702
- AAAAH!
- HI, SHAWN.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.809
- HEY'
- HEY!

41:56.840 --> 41:58.899
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING.

41:58.950 --> 42:01.077
I HAVEN'T DREAMED
LIKE THAT IN YEARS.

42:01.110 --> 42:03.214
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S MY CHEST.

42:03.250 --> 42:06.185
- YOU'RE A VERY
LUCKY LADY INDEED.

42:06.220 --> 42:07.118
[laughs]

42:07.150 --> 42:09.050
- HOW ARE YOU, DOT?
- PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

42:09.090 --> 42:10.057
- [clears throat]

42:10.090 --> 42:11.250
- SINCE I GOT
MY MONEY BACK,

42:11.290 --> 42:13.588
GEOFF AND I ARE
PLANNING ON BUYING THIS PLACE.

42:13.630 --> 42:16.155
- GET OUTTA HERE, THAT'S GREAT!
- YEAH!
