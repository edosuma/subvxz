<i>Previously on rescue me...</i>

00:01.601 --> 00:02.268
ahh!

00:02.303 --> 00:02.968
Ohh!

00:03.003 --> 00:03.599
Hey.

00:03.634 --> 00:04.534
I'm a friend of Lou's. So

00:04.569 --> 00:05.434
Just... I'll be a minute.

00:05.469 --> 00:06.365
Nice.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.400
Yeah, she's cute, huh?

00:07.435 --> 00:09.666
Yeah.

00:09.701 --> 00:10.817
I have one boundary, Lou. One

00:10.852 --> 00:11.899
Boundary and one boundary

00:11.934 --> 00:13.400
Only... no sex with nuns in the

00:13.435 --> 00:14.832
Place where I live.

00:14.867 --> 00:15.666
You know what, let's just

00:15.701 --> 00:17.434
Take these 3 and put 'em into a

00:17.469 --> 00:19.033
Big what-If Stack.

00:19.068 --> 00:20.701
Um, we totally picked the

00:20.736 --> 00:22.335
Same order. I'm actually

00:22.370 --> 00:23.934
Interested in this one,

00:23.969 --> 00:24.734
Specifically.

00:24.769 --> 00:25.365
Mmm.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.033
I'll take it.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.334
This is gonna sound kinda

00:27.369 --> 00:28.834
Strange, but, uh, I think I'm

00:28.869 --> 00:30.001
Getting submarined by a retard.

00:30.036 --> 00:31.502
You and me, this ain't about

00:31.537 --> 00:32.968
Power, ritchie. It's about both

00:33.003 --> 00:33.999
Of us loving Natalie.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.100
I think we got some stuff in

00:35.135 --> 00:36.084
Common.

00:36.119 --> 00:36.999
Like what?

00:37.034 --> 00:38.100
We're both smarter than we

00:38.135 --> 00:38.933
Look.

00:38.968 --> 00:39.866
Mike's gay.

00:39.901 --> 00:41.068
Yeah, tell me something I

00:41.103 --> 00:43.098
Don't know.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.800
Oh, you mean... gay gay.

00:44.835 --> 00:46.467
I need some viagra. I'm

00:46.502 --> 00:47.134
Serious.

00:47.169 --> 00:47.732
Ok.

00:47.767 --> 00:48.700
It's for the Chief. He's got

00:48.735 --> 00:49.634
A new girlfriend. He's afraid

00:49.669 --> 00:50.432
About performing.

00:50.467 --> 00:51.300
You can't let anyone at my

00:51.335 --> 00:52.500
Job know about this.

00:52.535 --> 00:53.499
I got it.

00:53.534 --> 00:56.534
Second of all, I'm an

00:56.569 --> 00:57.999
Illegal.

00:58.034 --> 00:59.666
Oh! Oh, Jesus.

00:59.701 --> 01:01.567
What's wrong, baby?

01:01.602 --> 01:03.399
God. My chest.

01:03.434 --> 01:04.331
You're gonna be ok.

01:04.367 --> 01:06.134
Please, call somebody. Call

01:06.169 --> 01:07.901
9-1-1. Colleen, please, wait

01:07.936 --> 01:11.265
Help me here. Unh. Uhh.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.200
You know what, Maggie? After

01:12.235 --> 01:13.384
Your performance the other day

01:13.419 --> 01:15.026
With the priest, I went home and

01:15.061 --> 01:16.664
I was really upset. And I was

01:16.699 --> 01:18.316
Thinking about you, and I threw

01:18.351 --> 01:19.576
Up. And I thought to myself, you

01:19.611 --> 01:20.772
Know what? I'm not the smartest

01:20.807 --> 01:21.934
Guy on the planet, but maybe you

01:21.969 --> 01:23.118
Shouldn't get married to a

01:23.153 --> 01:24.267
Person that actually makes you

01:24.302 --> 01:26.832
Throw up.

01:26.867 --> 01:28.817
Janet's pregnant. It wasn't

01:28.852 --> 01:30.767
Planned. You know, it just

01:30.802 --> 01:31.399
Happened.

01:31.434 --> 01:33.900
I want this. Whether it's his

01:33.935 --> 01:36.367
Or yours, I want this child to

01:36.402 --> 01:38.667
Replace what we lost.

01:41.767 --> 01:43.967
Johnny, Johnny! Hey, hey, you

01:44.002 --> 01:46.167
Ok? You hear me, Johnny. Jesus,

01:46.202 --> 01:48.632
Jesus.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.632
Dispatch, dispatch, 1013,

01:50.667 --> 01:51.799
Officer down. Dispatch, officer

01:51.834 --> 01:58.200
<i>Down. We need an ambulance. [Hell is 'rou</i>

Ism's and schisms,

02:12.100 --> 02:14.034
We're living helter skelter,

If you believe and deceive

Common sense says shouldn't

Receive, let me take you down

02:20.666 --> 02:22.767
The corridors of my life,

02:22.802 --> 02:24.098
And when you walk,

02:24.133 --> 02:26.367
Do you walk to your preference?

02:26.402 --> 02:27.999
No need to answer

02:28.034 --> 02:30.150
Till I take further evidence,

02:30.185 --> 02:32.267
I seem to need a reference

02:32.302 --> 02:33.799
To get residence,

02:33.834 --> 02:36.750
A reference to your preference

02:36.785 --> 02:39.667
To say, I'm a good neighbor,

02:39.702 --> 02:41.267
I trudge, so judge me

02:41.302 --> 02:42.666
From my labor,

02:42.701 --> 02:44.100
The bond on me ensures

02:44.135 --> 02:45.751
My good behavior,

02:45.786 --> 02:47.793
The constant strum

02:47.828 --> 02:49.864
Insures my insanity,

02:49.899 --> 02:51.533
Passing the ignorance

02:51.568 --> 02:53.167
Ensures the struggle

02:53.202 --> 02:54.601
For my family,

02:54.636 --> 02:55.966
We're hungry

02:56.001 --> 02:57.899
Beware of our appetite,

02:57.934 --> 03:00.133
Distant drums bring the news

03:00.168 --> 03:02.101
Of a kill tonight,

03:02.136 --> 03:04.052
The kill which I share

03:04.087 --> 03:05.933
With my passengers,

03:05.968 --> 03:08.068
We take our fill, take our fill,

03:08.103 --> 03:09.966
Take our fill,

Details of asian remedies,

03:22.702 --> 03:23.933
Conversations

03:23.968 --> 03:26.434

03:34.302 --> 03:36.084
And as I grow,

03:36.119 --> 03:37.876
I grow collective,

03:37.911 --> 03:39.599
Before the move

03:39.634 --> 03:42.132
Sit on the perspective,

03:42.167 --> 03:44.917
Mr. Quaye lay in the crevice,

03:44.952 --> 03:47.667
And watches from the precipice,

Imperial passage,

03:50.053 --> 03:52.299
Heat from the sun

03:52.334 --> 03:54.434
Some days slowly passes,

03:54.469 --> 03:55.666
Until then,

03:55.701 --> 03:57.968
You have to live with yourself

05:58.200 --> 05:59.750
Officially 2 hours overdue. I

05:59.785 --> 06:01.300
Mean, this is unheard of. Jerry

06:01.335 --> 06:02.033
Is never late.

06:02.068 --> 06:03.150
Yeah, still getting Tommy's

06:03.185 --> 06:04.233
Voicemail. Called him at home,

06:04.268 --> 06:05.098
Machine's full.

06:05.133 --> 06:06.098
I thought he was in the

06:06.133 --> 06:07.034
Shower when I left this morning.

06:07.069 --> 06:08.233
Maybe he liked slipped and

06:08.268 --> 06:09.265
Knocked himself out.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.433
You know what, the way his

06:10.468 --> 06:11.567
Life's been going, it would be

06:11.602 --> 06:12.232
An improvement.

06:12.267 --> 06:13.150
What do you want to do, Lou?

06:13.185 --> 06:14.043
What do I want to do? What

06:14.078 --> 06:15.023
Does Lou want to do? Lou wants

06:15.058 --> 06:16.145
To sit here with a box of donuts

06:16.180 --> 06:17.233
<i>And watch frankenstein. That's</i>

06:17.268 --> 06:18.351
What Lou wants to do.

06:18.386 --> 06:19.399
Although that particular

06:19.434 --> 06:20.917
Combination usually leads to a

06:20.952 --> 06:23.659
Jerk off session. So, Lou will

06:23.694 --> 06:26.367
Just stand here and worry.

06:26.402 --> 06:28.518
Hey.

06:28.553 --> 06:30.599
Hey.

06:30.634 --> 06:34.367
They, uh, they shot my brother.

06:34.402 --> 06:36.098
What?

06:36.133 --> 06:39.034
3 times in the back.

06:39.069 --> 06:40.200
Ahh.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.517
I gotta go tell my old man in

06:47.552 --> 06:50.634
Person. And I'm afraid about how

06:50.669 --> 06:51.832
He might react. He might

06:51.867 --> 06:53.983
Collapse or what. So l-I need

06:54.018 --> 06:56.100
Somebody to give me a hand.

06:56.135 --> 06:59.632
Yeah, sure.

06:59.667 --> 07:00.399
Guys, you're not going to

Don't understand why they do

07:44.836 --> 07:46.767
This to me all the time.

Jesus, who died?

They got a lead on this guy?

07:54.452 --> 07:56.426
Johnny was going to testify

07:56.461 --> 07:58.014
Against this drug dealer. Bronx

07:58.049 --> 07:59.708
Guy had 2 strikes against him

07:59.743 --> 08:01.367
And he's definitely going down

08:01.402 --> 08:02.867
For life probably.

08:02.902 --> 08:03.933
Scumbags.

08:03.968 --> 08:07.033
Yeah. Must of hired one of

08:07.068 --> 08:09.467
The guys who works for him to do

08:12.069 --> 08:14.567
Got a dead-On look at the guy.

08:14.602 --> 08:18.632
So...

08:18.667 --> 08:19.968
hey, Lou, thanks for doing this.

08:20.003 --> 08:20.966
I appreciate it.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.684
Don't thank me yet, I'm not

08:22.719 --> 08:24.367
Sure this is going to go all

08:24.402 --> 08:25.634
That well.

08:31.334 --> 08:33.634
He ain't movin' out!

08:39.701 --> 08:42.500
I'm not moving out.

08:42.534 --> 08:45.951
Are you guys deaf?!

08:45.986 --> 08:49.332
Dad, I think, uh...

08:49.367 --> 08:50.500
I think you're gonna want to sit

08:50.535 --> 08:51.198
Down.

08:51.233 --> 08:52.133
Don't tell him what to do.

08:52.168 --> 08:52.999
That's right.

08:53.034 --> 08:55.784
He wants to stand.

08:55.819 --> 08:58.499
I'm gonna stand.

08:58.534 --> 08:59.532
Mr. Gavin, I think, you

08:59.567 --> 09:01.533
Maybe... should be sittin' down

09:01.568 --> 09:03.500
When you hear what Tommy has to

09:03.535 --> 09:06.432
Say.

09:06.467 --> 09:08.065
Ah, shite.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.198
I'll get the whiskey.

09:11.233 --> 09:14.867
All right, bring it on. What

09:14.902 --> 09:15.634
Is it?

09:21.734 --> 09:23.401
Johnny's dead.

09:23.436 --> 09:25.033
They shot him.

09:25.068 --> 09:28.267
He was on a stakeout, last

09:28.302 --> 09:30.601
Night.

09:39.701 --> 09:42.851
I'm going to the bathroom.

09:42.886 --> 09:46.001
I need a little privacy for a

09:46.036 --> 09:47.300
Moment.

09:58.567 --> 10:00.233
Hey, Chief, the... uh... the side

10:00.268 --> 10:00.901
Door is locked.

10:00.936 --> 10:02.065
Oh, yeah.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.467
You wanna break this glass?

10:03.502 --> 10:04.768
Oh, I don't think so. This is

10:04.803 --> 10:06.034
Beveled glass, man. He'll shit

10:06.069 --> 10:07.434
If we break this.

10:07.469 --> 10:08.132
Yeah.

10:08.167 --> 10:10.068
Hey, Chief, his car's around

10:10.103 --> 10:10.766
Back.

10:10.801 --> 10:11.701
How 'bout this window here.

10:11.736 --> 10:12.768
You want to break that one?

10:12.803 --> 10:14.501
Now that's a storm window.

10:14.536 --> 10:15.951
You know what we went to the

10:15.986 --> 10:17.260
Track last week. The guy

10:17.295 --> 10:18.964
Owes me 40 bucks. Let's see

10:18.999 --> 10:20.634
If we can find a $40 window.

10:25.934 --> 10:26.967
Shit, shit, up here guys! Up

10:27.002 --> 10:28.001
Here! He's over here! Jerry!

10:28.036 --> 10:29.268
Jerry!

10:29.303 --> 10:30.465
Ah, shit.

10:30.500 --> 10:31.450
Come on, Franco, grab him.

10:31.485 --> 10:32.400
Let's roll. Jesus, let's go.

10:32.435 --> 10:34.451
Is he breathing?

10:34.486 --> 10:36.432
Oh, my God.

10:36.467 --> 10:37.250
Yeah, he is. He's breathing.

10:37.285 --> 10:37.999
He's breathing. Go get a

10:38.034 --> 10:39.934
Stretcher. Tell nils to get a

10:39.969 --> 10:40.766
Stretcher.

10:40.801 --> 10:41.632
Yeah, Pauly, hurry up.

10:41.667 --> 10:44.067
It's going to be all right,

10:44.102 --> 10:46.801
Chief. Just hang in there.

10:46.836 --> 10:49.500
All right, here's the deal.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.884
No black suits. No black ties.

10:53.919 --> 10:56.143
No black dresses. The only

10:56.178 --> 10:58.332
Formal clothes will be his

10:58.367 --> 11:01.133
Police brethren and their dress

11:01.168 --> 11:03.667
Blues. I want everyone in

11:03.702 --> 11:06.167
Colors, bright colors... like

11:06.202 --> 11:07.666
Spring in bloom.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.432
I want to celebrate my kid's

11:09.467 --> 11:11.517
Life, not his death... what he did

11:11.552 --> 11:16.392
While he was on this planet, how

11:16.427 --> 11:21.214
He almost always... put a... put a

11:21.249 --> 11:26.001
Smile on my face every time he

11:26.036 --> 11:30.901
Walked into a room.

11:30.936 --> 11:33.368
You follow?

11:33.403 --> 11:35.801
Yeah. Follow.

11:35.836 --> 11:38.484
Red?

11:38.519 --> 11:41.098
Yeah.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.534
We're going to need a lot

11:42.569 --> 11:46.185
More whiskey.

11:46.220 --> 11:49.801
Hey, baby.

11:53.701 --> 11:59.068
Ok, good luck, pal.

12:08.133 --> 12:10.350
It's ok, ellie. It's ok.

12:10.385 --> 12:13.359
It's all right. It's ok.

12:13.394 --> 12:16.334
I heard about your nephew

12:16.369 --> 12:18.933
Johnny. Oh, my God.

12:18.968 --> 12:21.767
Yeah. Yeah. Johnny, yeah.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.132
Aren't you upset?

12:27.167 --> 12:28.683
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I was. When I

12:28.718 --> 12:30.425
First heard, I was very, very

12:30.460 --> 12:32.597
Upset. I was pretty close to

12:32.632 --> 12:34.766
Crying. Yeah. But you got to

12:34.801 --> 12:37.017
Remember, sweetie, I mean Johnny

12:37.052 --> 12:39.010
Was a cop. I mean, firefighters

12:39.045 --> 12:40.772
We get burned up, we get knocked

12:40.807 --> 12:43.287
Around. Sometimes we even get

12:43.322 --> 12:46.145
Killed. But cops get shot at

12:46.180 --> 12:48.968
Every goddamn day of the week.

12:49.003 --> 12:50.885
He knew that going in...

12:50.920 --> 12:52.732
what are you doing?!

12:52.767 --> 12:54.133
How can you think about sex

12:54.168 --> 12:56.198
Right now?!

12:56.233 --> 12:57.467
You the gentlemen who are

12:57.502 --> 12:58.701
Here with Mr. Reilly?

12:58.736 --> 12:59.999
Yeah. Yeah.

13:00.034 --> 13:00.866
Ok, your Chief has had a

13:00.901 --> 13:02.068
Fairly significant heart attack.

13:02.103 --> 13:03.365
Shit.

13:03.400 --> 13:03.999
All right, we got him

13:04.034 --> 13:04.967
Stabilized. We're assessing the

13:05.002 --> 13:05.901
Damage. Now anybody here from

13:05.936 --> 13:06.901
His immediate family?

13:06.936 --> 13:07.832
Uh, well, we are his

13:07.867 --> 13:09.417
Immediate family, doc. I mean,

13:09.452 --> 13:10.876
He's got a son up in boston.

13:10.911 --> 13:12.272
All right, I'd call him asap.

13:12.307 --> 13:13.634
We may need some signatures.

13:13.669 --> 13:14.332
For?

13:14.367 --> 13:15.750
I can only discuss that with

13:15.785 --> 13:17.133
Family members. All right?

13:17.168 --> 13:18.766
Thanks, doc.

13:18.801 --> 13:21.034
This one has a Gold-Flecked

13:21.069 --> 13:22.901
Velvet lining with matching

13:22.936 --> 13:24.351
Pillow and, of course, the

13:24.386 --> 13:25.767
Lining extends throughout the

13:25.802 --> 13:27.198
Entire casket which is

13:27.233 --> 13:30.500
Solid steel with platinum chrome

13:30.535 --> 13:31.832
Piping. This is why it's

13:31.867 --> 13:33.968
Considered the Mercedes benz of

13:34.003 --> 13:35.065
Caskets.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.267
And how much?

13:36.302 --> 13:37.966
15,000.

13:38.001 --> 13:40.265
And the cemetery fees, the

13:40.300 --> 13:41.834
Cost of the embalming, the wake,

13:41.869 --> 13:43.532
All that?

13:43.567 --> 13:44.834
I'd have to sit down in front

13:44.869 --> 13:45.534
Of the computer...

13:45.569 --> 13:46.132
ballpark.

13:46.167 --> 13:50.265
About $40,000.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.417
Jesus, it'd be cheaper to buy

13:51.452 --> 13:52.534
A used Mercedes, put him in the

13:52.569 --> 13:53.966
Trunk, and drive him off a

13:54.001 --> 13:55.367
Goddamn bridge. Tom, what do you

13:55.402 --> 13:55.966
Think?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.951
How much is this one?

13:57.986 --> 13:59.901
The honda civic?

13:59.936 --> 14:01.185
$3,000.

14:01.220 --> 14:02.399
Yeah.

14:02.434 --> 14:03.200
I think we're gonna go with

14:03.235 --> 14:03.966
That one.

14:04.001 --> 14:04.934
I'll get started on the

14:04.969 --> 14:05.832
Paperwork.

14:05.867 --> 14:07.132
Yeah, sorry, pal.

14:07.167 --> 14:08.517
Jesus Christ, what are we

14:08.552 --> 14:09.867
Burying king tut over here?

14:14.334 --> 14:15.198
Yeah, hello?

14:15.233 --> 14:16.601
Lou, Jerry had a heart

14:16.636 --> 14:17.418
Attack.

14:17.453 --> 14:18.393
Oh, shit!

14:18.428 --> 14:19.299
What?

14:19.334 --> 14:20.167
Jerry had a heart attack.

14:20.202 --> 14:21.632
How's he doing?

14:21.667 --> 14:22.750
He's walking around eating a

14:22.785 --> 14:23.834
Philly cheese steak. How do you

14:23.869 --> 14:24.966
Think he's doing?

14:25.001 --> 14:25.867
Look, why don't you just give

14:25.902 --> 14:26.666
Me the skinny, ok?

14:26.701 --> 14:27.901
His son. We got to get

14:27.936 --> 14:28.532
A hold of him.

14:28.567 --> 14:29.334
You got digits on Jerry's

14:29.369 --> 14:29.966
Son?

14:30.001 --> 14:30.632
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:30.667 --> 14:31.634
Yeah, it's a done deal.

14:31.669 --> 14:32.566
Where you guys at?

14:32.601 --> 14:34.084
The funeral parlor, picking

14:34.119 --> 14:35.593
Out a casket for Johnny.

14:35.628 --> 14:36.914
Ah, shit. Maybe you better

14:36.949 --> 14:38.200
See if you can get a 2-For-1

14:38.235 --> 14:40.233
Deal. Talk to you soon.

14:40.268 --> 14:45.332
Right here.

14:45.367 --> 14:46.065
You know, we're not even

14:46.100 --> 14:47.801
Actually sure that that's what

14:47.836 --> 14:48.566
Happened.

14:48.601 --> 14:49.265
It doesn't take a

14:49.300 --> 14:50.517
Genius to figure it out. All I'm

14:50.552 --> 14:51.734
Saying is you don't really know

14:51.769 --> 14:52.901
That he actually took the

14:52.936 --> 14:53.599
Viagra.

14:53.634 --> 14:54.432
Ok, ok. Let's look at the

14:54.467 --> 14:55.500
Situation. He comes to me, says

14:55.535 --> 14:56.517
I'm dating this chick. I think

14:56.552 --> 14:57.676
Something might happen. She's

14:57.711 --> 14:58.756
Younger than me. I need a little

14:58.791 --> 14:59.801
Help. Can you get me something

14:59.836 --> 15:00.534
That's going to help...

15:00.569 --> 15:01.165
so?

15:01.200 --> 15:02.117
Right, blah, blah, blah. I

15:02.152 --> 15:03.192
Give him the stuff. Next thing

15:03.227 --> 15:04.313
We know, he's in the hospital in

15:04.348 --> 15:05.374
A coma. I'm tellin' you, if this

15:05.409 --> 15:06.400
<i>Were an episode of columbo, I'd</i>

15:06.435 --> 15:07.551
Be sweatin' my balls off.

15:07.586 --> 15:08.632
Look, and all I'm saying is

15:08.667 --> 15:09.800
Given Jerry's age and his weight

15:09.835 --> 15:11.134
And the stress that he's been

15:11.169 --> 15:12.568
Under, ok? If... and I'm not

15:12.603 --> 15:14.302
Saying he did... but if he

15:14.337 --> 15:15.669
Actually took the viagra that

15:15.704 --> 15:16.852
You gave him, you know what,

15:16.887 --> 15:18.001
When all is said and done, you

15:18.036 --> 15:20.033
Did him a favor.

15:20.068 --> 15:21.632
How you figure that?

15:21.667 --> 15:23.198
You gave him a magnificent

15:23.233 --> 15:24.367
Hard-On that he could leave this

15:24.402 --> 15:26.201
Godforsaken planet with.

15:26.236 --> 15:28.001
Yeah, I feel so much better

15:28.036 --> 15:28.699
Now.

15:28.734 --> 15:29.532
You know, how would you

15:29.567 --> 15:31.000
Rather go out... lying there

15:31.035 --> 15:32.601
Burned up like Stack in some

15:32.636 --> 15:34.101
Hospital bed where they come in

15:34.136 --> 15:35.851
And take a piece of you bit by

15:35.886 --> 15:37.567
Bit like you're a goddamn Mr.

15:37.602 --> 15:38.718
Potato head.

15:38.753 --> 15:39.799
Mm-Hmm.

15:39.834 --> 15:41.917
Or like Jerry... ha ha... banging

15:41.952 --> 15:44.426
Away, free as a bird, his cock

15:44.461 --> 15:46.597
As hard as a shovel. Huh? Mr.

15:46.632 --> 15:48.734
Potato head style or cock like a

15:48.769 --> 15:50.768
Shovel?

15:50.803 --> 15:52.732
Well?

15:52.767 --> 15:54.967
I'm thinking.

15:55.002 --> 15:57.167
Shovel cock.

15:57.202 --> 15:57.933
Huh?

15:57.968 --> 15:59.367
Shovel cock.

15:59.402 --> 16:00.767
That's my boy.

16:00.802 --> 16:01.601
Ahh.

17:12.500 --> 17:18.901
There? T., Tommy, ok, um... I feel

17:18.935 --> 17:25.001
Bad. I, um, um, Jesus.

17:26.834 --> 17:31.065
Sent yesterday at 9:58 P.M.

17:31.100 --> 17:33.750
I really want. Look Tom,

17:33.785 --> 17:37.059
I know this is bad man. I really

17:37.094 --> 17:40.330
Do. But I love her, man. And I

17:40.365 --> 17:43.567
Really, really care about her.

17:43.602 --> 17:44.999
But here's the thing.

17:45.034 --> 17:47.450
You... you're my brother. And I

17:47.485 --> 17:51.543
Want whatever's best for you and

17:51.578 --> 17:54.806
These kids and her. I, um, I do

17:54.841 --> 17:57.120
Care for her, t. But I get this

17:57.155 --> 17:59.227
Sense that she's still kinda

17:59.262 --> 18:01.165
Carrying a torch for you. I

18:01.200 --> 18:03.068
Don't know. Maybe that's the

18:03.103 --> 18:05.232
Best thing. I know this

18:05.267 --> 18:07.068
Would be a hard thing for you

18:07.103 --> 18:07.899
And me to get over.

18:07.934 --> 18:10.884
But that's secondary, man. Just

18:10.919 --> 18:13.659
Please call me, please. I love

18:13.694 --> 18:16.697
You, Tommy. So call me, please,

18:16.732 --> 18:19.299
Asap. And I'm sorry. I was... I

18:19.334 --> 18:21.867
Was out of my goddamn mind.

18:28.001 --> 18:29.901
T. Tommy...

18:29.936 --> 18:33.066
Tommy!

18:33.101 --> 18:33.799
Johnny's partner is on

18:33.834 --> 18:36.800
The phone. They found the guy.

18:44.134 --> 18:45.765
Yeah?

18:45.800 --> 18:46.983
We'll give you 10 minutes.

18:47.018 --> 18:48.193
That's the best I can do, bro.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.597
Nobody's watching, the camera's

18:49.632 --> 18:51.183
Are off, the 2 way, room there

18:51.218 --> 18:52.734
Is empty. The whole 9 yards.

18:52.769 --> 18:54.600
He's all yours, pal.

18:54.635 --> 18:55.951
Ready?

18:55.986 --> 18:57.127
Yeah.

18:57.162 --> 18:58.268
Ok.

19:52.667 --> 19:57.700
What'd they, uh, pay you?

19:57.735 --> 19:59.384
I don't know.

19:59.419 --> 20:01.034
How much?

20:09.234 --> 20:12.268
M-Maybe, um...

20:12.303 --> 20:13.899
what?

20:13.934 --> 20:15.967
Prolly, like, like, 8,000.

20:19.368 --> 20:21.567
8 grand...

20:27.734 --> 20:30.301
my brother was 41.

20:34.201 --> 20:40.901
40 goes into... it's like $200

20:40.936 --> 20:43.301
A year, basically, right?

20:43.336 --> 20:45.667
Yeah, something like that.

20:51.134 --> 20:52.101
8 grand...

20:59.001 --> 21:00.567
76...

21:02.400 --> 21:06.667
77 and a subway token.

21:06.702 --> 21:09.765
80 bucks.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.550
How much time do you figure

21:12.585 --> 21:15.301
That would've bought us?

21:15.336 --> 21:19.185
That would be...

21:19.220 --> 21:22.177
prolly 6...

21:22.212 --> 21:25.099
6 what?

21:25.134 --> 21:26.517
I don't... months,

21:26.552 --> 21:27.901
Days, l... I dunno.

21:30.467 --> 21:32.234
What's the difference?

21:44.400 --> 21:45.634
How do... how do you get 6

21:45.669 --> 21:48.785
Out of...

21:48.820 --> 21:51.010
maybe 7.

21:51.045 --> 21:53.201
Get up.

22:05.567 --> 22:09.400
Put your hands on the table.

22:09.435 --> 22:13.234
Hands out... open your legs.

22:13.269 --> 22:14.234
Spread your legs out.

22:14.269 --> 22:15.866
Come on.

22:15.901 --> 22:16.834
Stick your ass in the air.

22:16.869 --> 22:17.732
What?

22:17.767 --> 22:18.767
Stick your ass up in the air.

22:18.802 --> 22:20.268
Come on!

22:23.301 --> 22:25.334
You like that?

22:25.369 --> 22:28.565
Huh?

22:28.600 --> 22:31.033
Well, you better get used to it,

22:31.068 --> 22:33.467
Pal, 'cause this is the position

22:33.502 --> 22:34.234
You're gonna be in for the

22:34.269 --> 22:38.266
Next 30... 40 years.

22:38.301 --> 22:40.334
Takin' it up the ass, bitch.

22:56.634 --> 22:58.417
Ok, bro.

22:58.452 --> 22:59.709
Hi.

22:59.744 --> 23:00.932
Hey.

23:00.967 --> 23:01.767
Listen, you gotta get me

23:01.802 --> 23:02.532
The hell outta here.

23:02.567 --> 23:03.734
For the funeral? Teddy, I'm

23:03.769 --> 23:04.835
Sorry it's too late for that.

23:04.870 --> 23:05.866
The funeral? Christ, no.

23:05.901 --> 23:07.984
My wife, she's drivin' me nuts.

23:08.019 --> 23:10.060
Um, I'm a little lost here.

23:10.095 --> 23:11.764
You mark my words, once I'm

23:11.799 --> 23:13.433
Sprung she'll lose all interest

23:13.468 --> 23:16.651
In me. That's her m.O.

23:16.686 --> 23:19.799
What? I'm sorry, what?

23:19.834 --> 23:20.834
What line of defense do you

23:20.869 --> 23:21.951
Want me to take here?

23:21.986 --> 23:23.660
Call the mothers against

23:23.695 --> 23:25.097
Drunk drivin', the aclu,

23:25.132 --> 23:26.533
Call the teamsters, I don't

23:26.568 --> 23:28.201
Give a shit, just get me the

23:28.236 --> 23:29.834
Trial and let me plea my case.

23:29.869 --> 23:32.201
Get me out of here. Now.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.500
It's totally unfair.

23:37.535 --> 23:38.233
Why?

23:38.268 --> 23:39.517
Because in a bar full of hot

23:39.552 --> 23:40.732
Chicks, you can flirt and

23:40.767 --> 23:41.767
And chat and get phone numbers

23:41.802 --> 23:42.767
And blah blah blah, and you can

23:42.802 --> 23:43.901
Do the same thing in a bar

23:43.936 --> 23:45.001
Full of guys. You see what...

23:45.036 --> 23:46.398
holy shit.

23:46.433 --> 23:47.583
Take a look at that broad over

23:47.618 --> 23:48.559
There at the corner of the bar.

23:48.594 --> 23:49.500
Just... what's the matter with

23:49.535 --> 23:50.884
You? Don't be so obvious!

23:50.919 --> 23:52.209
I wasn't gonna be obvious,

23:52.244 --> 23:53.239
Jerk. I know what I'm doing.

23:53.274 --> 23:54.254
Yeah. Well, go easy all

23:54.289 --> 23:55.234
Right? Try subtlety.

23:55.269 --> 23:56.199
I'm not j.V.

23:56.234 --> 23:57.550
Yeah, ok, well, you sure

23:57.585 --> 23:58.867
Ain't varsity, Jack ass.

23:58.902 --> 24:00.401
Oh, Jesus Christ.

24:00.436 --> 24:01.852
Get over here.

24:01.887 --> 24:03.233
Oh, shit.

24:03.268 --> 24:04.433
Yeah, you see what I'm

24:04.468 --> 24:05.132
Saying?

24:05.167 --> 24:05.899
She's with a dude.

24:05.934 --> 24:06.866
This is what I'm saying.

24:06.901 --> 24:07.901
I can't over there 'cause she's

24:07.936 --> 24:09.001
With a guy, but you can go over

24:09.036 --> 24:10.251
There a-A-And hit on both of

24:10.286 --> 24:11.467
'Em. That's why this is unfair.

24:11.502 --> 24:13.334
Wait. Where are you goin'?

24:13.369 --> 24:15.167
I'm goin' to swing both ways,

24:15.202 --> 24:16.032
Bro.

24:16.067 --> 24:18.632
Wait. Yeah, hello?

24:18.667 --> 24:20.365
You left me a message?

24:20.400 --> 24:21.983
Oh, hey, uh, yeah, I just,

24:22.018 --> 24:23.509
I was a little concerned

24:23.544 --> 24:24.822
For you. I wanted to see

24:24.857 --> 24:26.029
How you were holding up.

24:26.064 --> 24:27.782
Yeah, I'm fine, and why?

24:27.817 --> 24:29.465
Uh, well, I don't know,

24:29.500 --> 24:30.800
Maggie, because maybe we were

24:30.835 --> 24:31.951
Sleeping in the same bed

24:31.986 --> 24:33.110
Until up about 4 days ago

24:33.145 --> 24:34.234
And I thought maybe you'd

24:34.269 --> 24:34.932
Be concerned.

24:34.967 --> 24:36.368
Hey, Garrity, do me a favor.

24:36.403 --> 24:37.785
Don't call me anymore.

24:37.820 --> 24:39.132
Hey, you called me.

24:39.167 --> 24:40.734
No, you called me first.

24:40.769 --> 24:44.668
What are you 12?

24:44.703 --> 24:48.532
Hey, how'd it go?

24:48.567 --> 24:49.500
You're not gonna like it.

24:49.535 --> 24:50.299
What happened?

24:50.334 --> 24:52.467
They're brother and sister.

24:52.502 --> 24:54.600
And he's gay, and I got both

24:54.635 --> 24:57.268
Their digits, bro.

24:57.303 --> 24:59.901
I hit the jackpot.

24:59.936 --> 25:01.166
Sean?

25:01.201 --> 25:03.333
All right... ok.

25:03.368 --> 25:05.184
Time for you to hit the books.

25:05.219 --> 25:07.909
<i>No, mamita, carite, don't go.</i>

25:07.944 --> 25:10.106
I have to go, pillow lips.

25:10.141 --> 25:12.268
Ritchie's expecting me.

25:12.303 --> 25:14.533
Study time.

25:14.568 --> 25:16.268
Huh.

25:21.167 --> 25:23.268
That is just unfair.

25:23.303 --> 25:25.268
I know.

26:02.034 --> 26:08.134
Am I crazy?

26:08.169 --> 26:11.365
No...

26:11.400 --> 26:14.400
but, uh, I think I might be.

26:25.467 --> 26:28.000
What the hell?

26:28.035 --> 26:30.498
Pop. Dad?

26:30.533 --> 26:32.201
Hey, kid, what are you doin'

26:32.236 --> 26:32.999
Here?

26:33.034 --> 26:34.034
You're in the hospital.

26:34.069 --> 26:34.699
What?

26:34.734 --> 26:35.617
You had a heart attack,

26:35.652 --> 26:36.609
But you're fine. You're

26:36.644 --> 26:37.538
In really good hands.

26:37.573 --> 26:38.433
Just relax and everything

26:38.468 --> 26:39.333
Will be ok.

26:39.368 --> 26:40.533
I gotta work, I got a day

26:40.568 --> 26:41.432
Tour.

26:41.467 --> 26:42.667
No, no, pop, you can't do

26:42.702 --> 26:44.032
That. Uh-Uh. Relax.

26:44.067 --> 26:45.268
You have to relax that's all.

26:45.303 --> 26:46.668
Hello, can we get some

26:46.703 --> 26:47.999
Help please, hello.

26:48.034 --> 26:49.700
Papa, just relax, you gotta

26:49.735 --> 26:50.601
Keep all this in.

26:50.636 --> 26:51.432
I can't breathe.

26:51.467 --> 26:53.250
You had a heart attack.

26:53.285 --> 26:55.034
Just relax, you're ok.

27:16.734 --> 27:19.767
Do you want a few minutes alone?

27:19.802 --> 27:22.634
Mm-Mmm.

27:37.600 --> 27:40.516
So, a-A-Ahem, what do you

27:40.551 --> 27:43.433
Want to, uh, do, ahem,

27:43.468 --> 27:45.584
Open casket-Wise?

27:45.619 --> 27:47.665
I don't know, Tom,

27:47.700 --> 27:49.683
Some people might want to see

27:49.718 --> 27:51.667
Him one last time, you know.

27:56.134 --> 27:59.950
It doesn't even look like him.

27:59.985 --> 28:03.732
He's all painted up, and...

28:03.767 --> 28:07.767
I love those dress blues though.

28:07.802 --> 28:10.632
This isn't him.

28:10.667 --> 28:14.083
What'd I tell you...

28:14.118 --> 28:16.259
after Connor's burial?

28:16.294 --> 28:18.365
That's why I don't go

28:18.400 --> 28:21.083
To the cemetery. That's not him.

28:21.118 --> 28:23.767
It's just a... it's just a body.

28:23.802 --> 28:25.067
He's... he's gone.

28:44.268 --> 28:45.318
Hello?

28:45.353 --> 28:46.333
Hey, it's me.

28:46.368 --> 28:47.101
I was just thinking

28:47.136 --> 28:47.866
About you.

28:47.901 --> 28:48.732
Oh, good, that's

28:48.767 --> 28:50.300
What I was hopin' to hear.

28:50.335 --> 28:51.799
Did you, um, give any more

28:51.834 --> 28:53.800
Thought to, you know, the boat?

28:53.835 --> 28:55.368
Yes, yes, I did.

28:55.403 --> 28:56.401
And?

28:56.436 --> 28:57.352
I'm in.

28:57.387 --> 28:58.277
Goddamn.

28:58.312 --> 28:59.132
Sorry.

28:59.167 --> 29:00.832
No, it's gonna be perfect

29:00.867 --> 29:03.150
For me. I mean living on a boat,

29:03.185 --> 29:05.433
Spending like the entire day

29:05.468 --> 29:06.884
On a boat living out in

29:06.919 --> 29:08.266
The hamptons and then all

29:08.301 --> 29:09.600
Of the winters just you and I...

29:09.635 --> 29:12.233
can we get a dog?

29:12.268 --> 29:13.734
Yeah, sure. Dog, cats, you

29:13.769 --> 29:15.201
Know, birds. We can get birds,

29:15.236 --> 29:15.901
Do you like birds?

29:15.936 --> 29:16.832
No, do you?

29:16.867 --> 29:18.117
No, no, I don't. Filthy

29:18.152 --> 29:19.093
Animals, but of course,

29:19.128 --> 29:20.034
You know, we can get one

29:20.069 --> 29:20.832
If you want.

29:20.867 --> 29:23.934
That is so sweet.

29:23.969 --> 29:25.500
I got to go.

29:33.001 --> 29:34.433
You always made me laugh,

29:34.468 --> 29:39.132
Johnny. Ahem.

29:39.167 --> 29:41.450
The time you put that frog

29:41.485 --> 29:43.359
In my bed, and then I put

29:43.394 --> 29:47.314
That other frog in your bed,

29:47.349 --> 29:49.941
And... you, uh, you got so

29:49.976 --> 29:52.438
Attached to the frog you kept

29:52.473 --> 29:54.901
Him in a jar on the night table

29:54.936 --> 29:56.398
Between the 2 beds.

29:56.433 --> 30:00.950
And then as we came to find out,

30:00.985 --> 30:04.026
Frogs can't live in jars, and

30:04.061 --> 30:07.067
Then you had that frog funeral,

30:07.102 --> 30:11.632
And you gave the eulogy.

30:11.667 --> 30:14.434
I was bitin' my lip the whole time.

30:14.469 --> 30:16.851
And remember that time

30:16.886 --> 30:19.234
When I was 10 we saw that old

30:19.269 --> 30:20.565
Cagney movie on TV?

30:20.600 --> 30:22.267
With the guys with the Tommy

30:22.302 --> 30:24.851
Guns leanin' out of the car

30:24.886 --> 30:27.400
Windows and you started callin'

30:27.435 --> 30:30.365
Me Tommy gun.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.850
And then everybody on the block

30:31.885 --> 30:33.301
Started calling me Tommy gun,

30:33.336 --> 30:35.565
And...

30:35.600 --> 30:38.300
that was my nickname all the way

30:38.335 --> 30:40.201
Through high school, and then we

30:40.236 --> 30:42.085
<i>Saw mean streets, and I started</i>

30:42.120 --> 30:44.410
Calling you Johnny boy after

30:44.445 --> 30:46.700
Deniro's character. You thought

30:46.735 --> 30:48.600
That was so cool.

30:57.167 --> 30:58.700
I'm sorry what I done to you,

30:58.735 --> 31:00.700
Johnny.

31:07.634 --> 31:09.732
I called you.

31:09.767 --> 31:12.201
I wanted to say I was sorry

31:12.236 --> 31:16.468
What I done to you.

31:16.503 --> 31:20.665
Ah... I wish I knew

31:20.700 --> 31:22.167
If you got the message or not...

31:22.202 --> 31:26.067
aah! That's it, definitely

31:26.102 --> 31:27.932
Closed casket, ok?

31:27.967 --> 31:29.484
We got a nice picture of him

31:29.519 --> 31:30.966
Here. You know, handsome,

31:31.001 --> 31:32.167
Glowing, big smile on his face.

31:32.202 --> 31:33.201
Everybody'll enjoy it...

31:33.236 --> 31:34.199
ah-Haa...

31:34.234 --> 31:35.166
what's wrong?

31:35.201 --> 31:37.034
Ah, my hand got closed

31:37.069 --> 31:38.132
In the casket.

31:38.167 --> 31:39.117
Oh, ok, oh, my God.

31:39.152 --> 31:40.342
Lou, get the guy.

31:40.377 --> 31:41.498
Where you goin'?

31:41.533 --> 31:43.067
You said to get the guy.

31:43.102 --> 31:43.901
Give me a hand.

31:43.936 --> 31:45.365
Aah...

31:45.400 --> 31:47.467
not there, on the other side.

31:47.502 --> 31:48.299
Shit.

31:48.334 --> 31:49.365
Aah... ohh!

31:49.400 --> 31:51.368
Oh, my God, oh, my God,

31:51.403 --> 31:52.465
Oh, my God.

31:52.500 --> 31:53.900
Oh, oh, you're gonna

31:53.935 --> 31:55.301
Lose one nail, maybe 2.

31:55.336 --> 31:56.432
Ohh...

31:56.467 --> 32:00.465
uhh... what?

32:00.500 --> 32:03.800
You left him a message?

32:03.835 --> 32:05.266
Yeah.

32:05.301 --> 32:09.498
Did he get it?

32:09.533 --> 32:10.500
Don't freak out about it.

32:10.535 --> 32:11.467
I'm not the one freaking

32:11.502 --> 32:12.266
About it.

32:12.301 --> 32:13.601
I'm not freaking out. That

32:13.636 --> 32:15.452
Much. Ok, so what, so you look

32:15.487 --> 32:17.443
Vaguely, in a barely noticeable

32:17.478 --> 32:19.439
Way, really, you know, what?

32:19.474 --> 32:21.887
Around the nose, uh, a little

32:21.922 --> 32:23.828
Bit around the eyes, and a tiny,

32:23.863 --> 32:25.734
Tiny, little bit around the lips

32:25.769 --> 32:27.001
Like my daughter. So what?

32:27.036 --> 32:28.234
You hear that sound in your

32:28.269 --> 32:29.034
Voice?

32:29.069 --> 32:29.765
Yeah?

32:29.800 --> 32:30.634
That's the sound of you

32:30.669 --> 32:31.465
Freaking out.

32:31.500 --> 32:32.467
I don't see what the problem

32:32.502 --> 32:33.299
Is.

32:33.334 --> 32:34.565
The problem is you gotta

32:34.600 --> 32:35.533
Figure out what's going on with

32:35.568 --> 32:36.899
The women in your life.

32:36.934 --> 32:37.934
You gotta figure out what you're

32:37.969 --> 32:39.800
Doin' with me. What you did

32:39.835 --> 32:42.166
With your daughter.

32:42.201 --> 32:45.817
All right, look, I think

32:45.852 --> 32:48.443
About you all the time. Ok?

32:48.478 --> 32:50.789
I mean like you got me bouncin'

32:50.824 --> 32:53.101
Off the walls in the firehouse,

32:53.136 --> 32:54.066
You can ask the guys.

32:54.101 --> 32:58.301
L... I feel like I can't eat

32:58.336 --> 33:00.235
When I'm not with you.

33:00.270 --> 33:02.134
I can't breathe when I am.

33:02.169 --> 33:06.498
You know, I'm just...

33:06.533 --> 33:11.217
shit, I love you, Natalie.

33:11.252 --> 33:14.526
Well, you've got the me part

33:14.561 --> 33:17.130
Figured out. Now it's time for

33:17.165 --> 33:19.700
You to think about Keela for a

33:19.735 --> 33:21.734
Little while.

33:32.834 --> 33:33.999
They brought this stuff

33:34.034 --> 33:35.400
From the hospital a couple hours

33:35.435 --> 33:36.365
After.

33:36.400 --> 33:39.550
Thank you.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.700
Thanks.

33:44.101 --> 33:46.800
You have one unheard

33:46.835 --> 33:50.801
Message. First unheard message.

33:50.836 --> 33:54.585
Hey, uh, Johnny, it's me.

33:54.620 --> 33:57.593
Listen, man, ahem, about the,

33:57.628 --> 34:00.567
Uh, thing at the firehouse

34:00.602 --> 34:02.935
The other day, I, uh,

34:02.970 --> 34:05.585
I just... wanted to say,

34:05.620 --> 34:08.166
You know, I'm sorry, man,

34:08.201 --> 34:11.850
You know, but, what can I say,

34:11.885 --> 34:15.525
Man? I still love her, you know,

34:15.561 --> 34:18.697
I always have, I screwed up,

34:18.732 --> 34:22.233
And I don't blame you for,

34:22.268 --> 34:26.734
Uh, you know, she's a great

34:26.768 --> 34:30.284
Chick, man. She's just, uh,

34:30.319 --> 34:34.342
I don't have to tell you. Um...

34:34.378 --> 34:37.289
I love her, man, l... I wish I

34:37.324 --> 34:40.512
Hadn't had my head up my ass

34:40.547 --> 34:42.889
All these years when it came

34:42.925 --> 34:46.946
To her, but anyways, uh,

34:46.981 --> 34:50.967
, uh, so...

34:52.333 --> 34:54.500
To delete, press 7.

34:54.534 --> 34:55.567
To save...

35:31.067 --> 35:32.901
The lord is my shepherd,

35:32.936 --> 35:35.398
I shall not want.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.301
He maketh me to lie down

35:37.336 --> 35:38.866
In green pastures.

35:38.901 --> 35:41.201
He leadeth me beside the still

35:41.236 --> 35:42.498
Waters.

35:42.533 --> 35:45.066
He restoreth my soul.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.799
He leadeth me in the paths

35:46.834 --> 35:49.633
Of righteousness for his name's

35:49.668 --> 35:52.433
Sake. Yea, though I walk through

35:52.468 --> 35:54.101
The valley of the shadow

35:54.136 --> 35:55.734
Of death I will fear no evil

35:55.769 --> 35:58.535
For thou art with me.

35:58.570 --> 36:01.266
Thy rod and thy staff,

36:01.301 --> 36:03.867
They comfort me. Thou preparest

36:03.902 --> 36:05.468
A table before me in the

36:05.503 --> 36:06.935
Presence of mine enemies.

36:06.970 --> 36:09.652
Thou annointest my head with

36:09.687 --> 36:11.710
Oil. My cup runneth over.

36:11.745 --> 36:13.473
Surely goodness and mercy

36:13.508 --> 36:15.587
Shall follow me all the days

36:15.622 --> 36:18.761
Of my life, and I will dwell in

36:18.796 --> 36:21.164
The house of the lord forever.

36:21.199 --> 36:22.933
Lord God, our father, please

36:22.968 --> 36:24.734
Watch over and welcome your

36:24.769 --> 36:26.451
Servant John Gavin into your

36:26.486 --> 36:28.026
Heavenly kingdom. Where he will

36:28.061 --> 36:29.847
Live forever with all the angels

36:29.882 --> 36:31.791
And saints, and all who have

36:31.826 --> 36:33.629
Departed before him. Let our

36:33.664 --> 36:35.382
Sorrow be tempered by the fact

36:35.417 --> 36:37.066
That John rests now in your

36:37.101 --> 36:39.167
Loving embrace. The same embrace

36:39.202 --> 36:41.334
That awaits each one of us when

36:41.369 --> 36:43.467
Our time here on earth is done.

37:09.134 --> 37:10.167
In the name of the father,

37:10.202 --> 37:11.201
The son, and the holy spirit.

37:11.236 --> 37:12.066
Amen.

37:12.101 --> 37:13.699
Amen.

37:13.734 --> 37:17.767
That was nice, huh?

37:17.802 --> 37:20.432
Thank you.

37:20.467 --> 37:21.465
So what's the deal,

37:21.500 --> 37:22.233
You speak sign language?

37:22.268 --> 37:23.367
Yeah, I speak sign language.

37:23.402 --> 37:24.467
Like I was born without ears.

37:24.502 --> 37:25.565
How about you?

37:25.600 --> 37:26.934
Yeah, of course, obviously,

37:26.969 --> 37:27.800
You saw me.

37:27.835 --> 37:29.251
Hey.

37:29.286 --> 37:30.632
Hi.

37:30.667 --> 37:33.498
Good. Rosemarie, this is

37:33.533 --> 37:35.767
Sean. Sean, this is rosemarie

37:35.802 --> 37:38.565
Our long lost sister.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.634
I've heard a lot about you.

37:40.669 --> 37:42.134
From who?

37:42.169 --> 37:43.565
From Maggie.

37:43.600 --> 37:47.200
Of course. Nice to meet you.

37:47.235 --> 37:49.718
The girls... katie, kelly.

37:49.753 --> 37:51.493
What did I say, I didn't

37:51.528 --> 37:53.597
Even know you had a sister.

37:53.632 --> 37:55.333
She was born deaf and mute,

37:55.368 --> 37:56.834
And eventually she gained

37:56.869 --> 37:58.101
The ability to use her vocal

37:58.136 --> 37:59.834
Chords, like, to a limited

37:59.869 --> 38:01.435
Extent, but my parents they

38:01.470 --> 38:02.752
Put her in a private school

38:02.787 --> 38:03.999
So she wouldn't embarrass

38:04.034 --> 38:06.717
The family. Never visited her,

38:06.752 --> 38:09.400
Never even spoke her name.

38:09.435 --> 38:10.667
Hello, daughter.

38:10.702 --> 38:12.233
Hi, dad.

38:12.268 --> 38:13.799
Everything that's happened

38:13.834 --> 38:18.567
Between us... life is too short.

38:18.602 --> 38:22.201
How do you say "I'm sorry"

38:22.236 --> 38:24.167
With your hands?

38:32.467 --> 38:33.465
How did you learn sign

38:33.500 --> 38:37.368
Language anyway? It's so sexy.

38:37.403 --> 38:38.785
Well, my grandmother was

38:38.820 --> 38:40.393
Deaf, and I really loved her

38:40.428 --> 38:41.967
A lot, she was a sweet lady.

38:42.002 --> 38:43.118
We used to spend whole

38:43.153 --> 38:44.610
Afternoons in the summer

38:44.645 --> 38:45.839
Just signing. I remember

38:45.874 --> 38:46.870
This one time when she was

38:46.905 --> 38:48.019
On her deathbed, actually,

38:48.054 --> 38:49.099
This is a funny story.

38:49.134 --> 38:50.283
Ok, that's enough with sob

38:50.318 --> 38:51.433
Story, signmeister, let's go,

38:51.468 --> 38:52.267
We gotta roll.

38:52.302 --> 38:53.818
What? Roll where?

38:53.853 --> 38:55.343
Hey, father francis.

38:55.378 --> 38:56.472
Maggie, I'm so sorry

38:56.507 --> 38:57.532
For your troubles.

38:57.567 --> 38:58.533
Oh, you don't know the least

38:58.568 --> 38:59.500
Of it. How much to marry Sean

38:59.535 --> 39:00.784
And me, here.

39:00.819 --> 39:01.999
Um, when?

39:02.034 --> 39:03.901
Well, right now, here.

39:03.936 --> 39:05.135
Oh, um...

39:05.170 --> 39:06.299
Here?

39:06.334 --> 39:07.801
Oh, uh, this is a sacred

39:07.836 --> 39:09.268
Burial ground, Maggie, l...

39:09.303 --> 39:11.032
not here, right here,

39:11.067 --> 39:12.301
Like here, over by that tree,

39:12.336 --> 39:13.233
Here.

39:13.268 --> 39:14.701
Oh, well, you know it's

39:14.736 --> 39:16.002
Against the rules of the

39:16.037 --> 39:17.185
Catholic church to marry 2

39:17.220 --> 39:18.334
People outdoors unless there's

39:18.369 --> 39:19.266
A very specific,

39:19.301 --> 39:20.151
Special dispensation.

39:20.186 --> 39:20.966
Well, how much did Tommy

39:21.001 --> 39:21.901
Pay you to do the funeral mass

39:21.936 --> 39:22.867
And then this part?

39:22.902 --> 39:24.732
300. Cash.

39:24.767 --> 39:26.099
We'll give you 400

39:26.134 --> 39:27.934
To marry us here today.

39:27.969 --> 39:28.866
We will?

39:28.901 --> 39:29.765
You got it on you?

39:29.800 --> 39:31.200
You got any cabbage on you?

39:31.235 --> 39:32.301
No, I have like $40 on me.

39:32.336 --> 39:33.268
I didn't think I would be

39:33.303 --> 39:34.118
Getting married today,

39:34.153 --> 39:34.943
Which is I guess what's

39:34.978 --> 39:35.806
Happening apparently.

39:35.841 --> 39:36.634
Make it 500, you pay me

39:36.669 --> 39:37.584
By check.

39:37.619 --> 39:38.500
Done deal.

39:38.535 --> 39:39.365
Oh.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.765
Hey, everybody, come back,

39:40.800 --> 39:41.950
Hey. Sweetie, grab some flowers

39:41.985 --> 39:43.101
Off the casket, meet me under

39:43.136 --> 39:43.999
The tree, ok?

39:44.034 --> 39:44.934
But this is crazy.

39:44.969 --> 39:45.799
You wanted a priest.

39:45.834 --> 39:46.917
I'm getting you a priest,

39:46.952 --> 39:48.001
And we're makin' it easier

39:48.036 --> 39:49.318
For everyone.

39:49.353 --> 39:50.376
Mwah! Hurry up!

39:50.411 --> 39:51.365
I'm going.

39:51.400 --> 39:54.268
Hey, everybody, hold up! Yo!

39:55.901 --> 39:57.599
I'm gettin' married!

39:57.634 --> 39:59.266
Sean, do you take Maggie

39:59.301 --> 40:01.667
To be your lawfully wedded wife,

40:01.702 --> 40:04.034
To have and to hold, for richer

40:04.069 --> 40:05.901
Or poorer, in sickness and

40:05.936 --> 40:07.234
In health, till death

40:07.269 --> 40:08.167
Do you part?

40:08.202 --> 40:09.333
I do.

40:09.368 --> 40:10.199
Excuse me, excuse me.

40:10.234 --> 40:11.567
Do you mind? We're trying

40:11.602 --> 40:12.534
To get married here.

40:12.569 --> 40:13.432
You're standing on my

40:13.467 --> 40:15.200
Mother... her... her grave.

40:15.235 --> 40:16.934
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

40:16.969 --> 40:17.599
Sorry.

40:17.634 --> 40:18.517
Honey, why don't we...

40:18.552 --> 40:19.400
ok, yeah, everybody move

40:19.435 --> 40:20.334
10 feet that way.

40:24.834 --> 40:26.066
Sorry.

40:26.101 --> 40:29.017
You got one crazy family.

40:29.052 --> 40:31.934
Don't tell me. I'm gettin'

40:31.969 --> 40:32.899
Out of it.

40:32.934 --> 40:34.101
Maggie, do you take Sean

40:34.136 --> 40:35.365
To be...

40:35.400 --> 40:36.233
could you wrap it up,

40:36.268 --> 40:37.101
Father, before somebody else

40:37.136 --> 40:37.935
Wants to visit whoever

40:37.970 --> 40:39.435
We're standing on now.

40:39.470 --> 40:40.901
Of course, do you?

40:40.936 --> 40:42.066
I do.

40:42.101 --> 40:43.800
I now pronounce you man and

40:43.835 --> 40:45.500
Wife. You may kiss the bride.

40:45.535 --> 40:47.699
Aww...

40:47.734 --> 40:49.900
hey, is it kosher to applaud

40:49.935 --> 40:52.067
A wedding in a cemetery?

40:52.102 --> 40:55.601
Can't hurt, right?

40:55.636 --> 40:59.066
Ladies and gentlemen,

40:59.101 --> 41:01.217
I present to you Mr. And Mrs...

41:01.252 --> 41:03.334
what was the last name again?

41:03.369 --> 41:04.484
Garrity-Gavin.

41:04.519 --> 41:05.443
Gavin-Garrity.

41:05.478 --> 41:06.333
I present to you

41:06.368 --> 41:08.967
Mr. And Mrs... gavity.

41:09.002 --> 41:10.034
Yeah!

41:24.533 --> 41:25.467
Oh, no, those are mine.

41:25.502 --> 41:27.184
Those are mine,

41:27.219 --> 41:28.867
But those are nice.

41:41.967 --> 41:42.834
So you don't, uh, follow

41:42.869 --> 41:43.699
Any sports?

41:43.734 --> 41:44.565
Eh, a little soccer,

41:44.600 --> 41:46.967
A little tennis, what about you?

41:47.002 --> 41:48.599
La crosse.

41:48.634 --> 41:49.800
Really, tough sport.

41:49.835 --> 41:50.734
Excuse me.

41:54.368 --> 41:55.867
Hey, Tommy, can we turn

41:55.902 --> 41:56.968
The music off?

41:57.003 --> 41:58.034
Honey, people are

41:58.069 --> 41:58.899
Enjoying it.

41:58.934 --> 42:00.067
Given the circumstances

42:00.102 --> 42:01.201
Isn't this a little

42:01.236 --> 42:02.398
Inappropriate.

42:02.433 --> 42:03.333
Ok, honey, we just

42:03.368 --> 42:05.301
Had Maggie's fourth wedding, ok?

42:05.336 --> 42:06.368
Moments after we finished

42:06.403 --> 42:07.252
Burying Johnny, ok?

42:07.287 --> 42:08.360
I think this entire

42:08.395 --> 42:09.398
Family's inappropriate.

42:09.433 --> 42:10.533
All right, and do me a favor?

42:10.568 --> 42:11.432
Hnn...

42:11.467 --> 42:12.334
dance with my daughter

42:12.369 --> 42:14.001
Please?

42:29.700 --> 42:30.799
Hey.

42:30.834 --> 42:33.017
So goddamn corny.

42:33.052 --> 42:35.476
Oh, so how are you?

42:35.511 --> 42:37.901
On a scale of 1 to 10?

42:37.936 --> 42:39.032
Yeah.

42:39.067 --> 42:41.283
12. Met a guy, movin'

42:41.318 --> 42:43.276
In together, great sex,

42:43.311 --> 42:44.989
Great house. On the beach

42:45.024 --> 42:46.545
In san diego, I'm working

42:46.580 --> 42:47.907
With speech impaired kids.

42:47.942 --> 42:49.234
He's a carpenter. No money,

42:49.269 --> 42:51.465
But total happiness.

42:51.500 --> 42:56.234
I heard about you and Janet

42:56.269 --> 42:57.734
And Johnny.

42:57.769 --> 43:01.066
Yeah.

43:01.101 --> 43:03.584
Listen, it's all about

43:03.619 --> 43:05.860
Sex and love, right? Life?

43:05.895 --> 43:08.101
We can all die tomorrow.

43:08.136 --> 43:10.551
Happy is the key.

43:10.586 --> 43:12.967
You gotta be happy.

43:13.002 --> 43:13.866
Nice speech.

43:13.901 --> 43:15.001
Know where I first heard

43:15.036 --> 43:16.234
That speech?

43:16.269 --> 43:17.651
Where?

43:17.686 --> 43:18.999
From you.

43:19.034 --> 43:20.701
After all they've put me

43:20.736 --> 43:22.333
Through, mom and dad,

43:22.368 --> 43:24.734
You know how that made me feel.

43:24.769 --> 43:27.184
You gave me that speech.

43:27.219 --> 43:29.043
You opened up my eyes.

43:29.078 --> 43:30.789
You opened up my ears,

43:30.824 --> 43:35.212
Tommy. You made it seem

43:35.247 --> 43:39.023
So clear cut. Thank you.

43:39.058 --> 43:42.029
Now, if you excuse me,

43:42.064 --> 43:45.001
I absolutely must go dance

43:45.036 --> 43:46.134
With kenny shea.

44:17.634 --> 44:18.966

44:20.201 --> 44:21.000

44:24.302 --> 44:26.184
Ooh. I bought the house.

44:26.219 --> 44:27.826

44:27.861 --> 44:29.381

44:29.416 --> 44:30.866
Mm-Hmm, the one I liked?

Ok?

44:44.034 --> 44:44.850

We're just talkin'.

45:19.834 --> 45:23.268
That's a little disturbing.

45:33.034 --> 45:35.617
All right, ahem.

45:35.652 --> 45:38.166
Made my decision.

45:38.201 --> 45:41.034
I'm gonna leave the FDNY.
