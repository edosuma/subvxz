Benson: ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.
WE'VE GOTTEN SOME COMPLAINTS

00:12.000 --> 00:15.320
ABOUT THE HUGE SINK HOLE IN THE
PARK.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.620
Mordecai: SINK HOLE?

00:14.720 --> 00:17.680
YOU MEAN THE CRASH PIT?
Muscle Man: YOU TALKING SMACK

00:16.800 --> 00:17.980
ABOUT THE CRASH PIT, BRO?

00:18.080 --> 00:18.780
Benson: YES.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.320
IT'S A POTENTIAL LIABILITY, AND
WE'RE NOT PROPERLY INSURED FOR

00:21.760 --> 00:22.140
IT.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.900
IT HAS TO BE FILLED IMMEDIATELY.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.640

00:25.280 --> 00:26.100
COME ON, BENSON.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.860
YOU CAN'T FILL UP THE CRASH PIT.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.920

MORE WARNING SIGNS OR SOMETHING?

00:29.880 --> 00:30.540
Benson: NO!

00:30.640 --> 00:33.800
A THING CALLED A "CRASH PIT"
SHOULDN'T EVEN BE AT THE PARK IN

00:33.160 --> 00:36.000
THE FIRST PLACE.
Rigby: WHAT IF WE CALL IT A

00:35.200 --> 00:36.660
"SMALL HOLE"?

00:36.760 --> 00:39.840
Benson: JUST FILL IT UP BY
THE END OF THE DAY, OR YOU'RE

00:38.920 --> 00:41.100

THIS IS MORDO COMING TO YOU LIVE

01:51.760 --> 01:55.200
FOR ONE LAST CRASH IN THE CRASH

THIS IS HISTORY IN THE MAKING.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.920

02:37.040 --> 02:37.820
IT'S OKAY, GUYS.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.360
THAT PROTECTIVE CAGE PROBABLY
KEPT THE CAMERA SAFE.

Mordecai: DUDE, CHILL.
WE CAN PROBABLY JUST REPLACE IT.

IT'S...$5,000.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.540

Rigby: WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT.
Thomas: WHY?

03:01.760 --> 03:05.000
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO IT?
Muscle Man: NO!

03:03.520 --> 03:06.320
