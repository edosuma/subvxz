10:06.897 --> 10:13.279
OH, YOU ARE A DIRECT DESCENDENT
OF THE HIGH PRIESTESS AMNERIS.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.448
YOU ARE CHOSEN.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.782
THE PARAGON.

10:16.866 --> 10:17.908
- PARAGON?

10:17.992 --> 10:19.702
- AND THE OSIRIAN
IS YOUR PROTECTOR.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.413
TOGETHER,
YOU KEEP THE WORLD SAFE.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.873
- WHAT?
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

10:23.956 --> 10:25.541
REWIND.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.084
THE WORLD?

10:27.168 --> 10:30.755
- YOU CANNOT ESCAPE
YOUR DESTINY.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.470
- JOY, LOOK--

10:37.553 --> 10:40.556
- FABIAN, WHATEVER IT IS
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, DON'T.

10:40.639 --> 10:41.432
- WHA--

10:41.515 --> 10:42.725
- I KNOW I DID A BAD THING.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.101
I DON'T NEED TO BE TOLD
I DID A BAD THING,

10:44.185 --> 10:47.521
AND THE LAST THING I NEED
RIGHT NOW IS A LECTURE FROM YOU.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.358
- NO, AND A LECTURE IS
THE LAST THING YOU'RE GETTING.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.485
WHATEVER BAD THING YOU'VE DONE,
I DON'T CARE.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.195
JOY.

10:54.278 --> 10:59.241
LOOK, I REALLY, REALLY
NEED YOUR HELP RIGHT NOW.

10:59.325 --> 11:03.412
- LIKE SUN AND MOON.
LIKE YIN AND YANG.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.124
THE CHOSEN ONE HAS ALWAYS HAD
HER COUNTERPART.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.418
PARAGON AND OSIRIAN
HAVE BEEN PAIRED TOGETHER

11:09.502 --> 11:12.296
THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.215
- SO WHO'S MY YANG?

11:14.298 --> 11:18.052
- YOU DO NOT KNOW,

11:18.135 --> 11:20.513
BUT ONE THING IS CERTAIN.

11:24.683 --> 11:27.853
HE WILL NOT BE FAR AWAY.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.904
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ASKED JOY TO HELP

11:36.987 --> 11:37.780
WITHOUT CHECKING
WITH US FIRST, FABIAN.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.282
THE FIRST RULE
ABOUT SIBUNA IS,

11:40.366 --> 11:41.867
YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT SIBUNA.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.619
- I TOLD YOU, WE SHOULD'VE HAD
MARA AND JOY

11:43.702 --> 11:45.621
FIGHT IT OUT BETWEEN THEM,
A CHESS OFF.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.039
TWO CUTE GIRLS
IN A BRAINY GRUDGE MATCH.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.958
OW.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.252
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT.
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ANYTHING.

11:51.335 --> 11:52.545
- SIBUNA.
all: SHH.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.296
- SORRY.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.464
HAS FABIAN TOLD YOU?

11:55.548 --> 11:57.716
HE ASKED ME TO JOIN THE GANG.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.263
SIBUNA!

12:02.346 --> 12:04.598
- AH, THAT...RIGHT THERE.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.058
- OH, IS THIS THE ONE?
- YEAH.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.184
- NO!

12:07.268 --> 12:08.853
- [laughs]

12:08.936 --> 12:12.440
- AS A TEMPORARY MEMBER,
THAT'S ALL.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.858
- YEP.

12:13.941 --> 12:17.027
SO, FABES, YOU WANT TO TEACH ME
HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME OR WHAT?

12:17.111 --> 12:18.904
- I--I--

12:22.867 --> 12:26.328
- AND JEROME WENT TO SEE SWEETIE
AND SORTED THE WHOLE JOY THING,

12:26.412 --> 12:28.122
AND NOW MY ARTICLE'S
BEEN ENTERED

12:28.205 --> 12:30.166
INTO THIS MAJOR COMPETITION.

12:30.249 --> 12:30.666
- THAT'S GREAT.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.626
- I KNOW.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.795
IF IT WASN'T FOR JEROME,
I WOULD STILL BE JACK JACKAL.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.255
OH, AND DID I TELL YOU HOW HE--

12:36.338 --> 12:39.091
- YEAH, MARA.

12:39.175 --> 12:39.717
SEVERAL TIMES.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.011
[laughs nervously]

12:42.094 --> 12:43.220
- ARE YOU OKAY?

12:43.304 --> 12:45.848
- YEAH, IT'S JUST--

12:45.931 --> 12:50.436
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT JEROME A LOT.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.187
- HAVE I?

12:51.270 --> 12:53.397
SORRY.

12:53.481 --> 12:55.774
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU THOUGHT THIS

12:55.858 --> 12:58.861
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP THING
WASN'T WORKING,

12:58.944 --> 13:02.656
THEN I'D UNDERSTAND, I GUESS.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.575
- I-I DON'T THINK THAT.

13:04.658 --> 13:07.411
JEROME AND I ARE JUST FRIENDS.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.412
- OH, GOOD.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.247
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

13:10.331 --> 13:10.873
[laughs]

13:14.835 --> 13:18.547
- ANYWAY, UM,
I BETTER LET YOU GET TO BED.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.466
IT MUST BE 3:00 IN THE MORNING
OVER THERE.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.717
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.010
YOU'RE WORTH IT.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.763
LOOK, I'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN I GET UP FOR REAL.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.890
I MISS YOU.

13:27.973 --> 13:28.849
- ME TOO.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.859
[sighs]

13:42.404 --> 13:43.572
- YES!

13:43.656 --> 13:45.783
AND THE HUMAN WINS AGAIN!

13:45.866 --> 13:47.368
- WELL DONE.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.912
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S A
WHOLE SET OF TUNNELS DOWN THERE.

13:49.995 --> 13:50.996
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.373
- MM.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.917
- YEAH, WELL, IF YOU'D BEEN
THROUGH WHAT WE HAVE,

13:55.000 --> 13:57.002
YOU'D REALIZE IT'S NOT
JUST ONE BIG GAME.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.587
- I THOUGHT THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT WAS.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.089
ONE BIG GAME?

14:00.172 --> 14:03.842
- UM, ACTUALLY--AMBER, I HAVEN'T
TOLD JOY ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.220
IT'S BEST WE DO THIS STRICTLY
ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS.

14:06.303 --> 14:07.846
- OH, THANKS.

14:07.930 --> 14:11.267
BUT NINA IS TRAPPED SOMEWHERE,
RIGHT?

14:11.350 --> 14:13.561
AND IF I HELP YOU WIN THIS GAME,
WE GET HER OUT?

14:13.644 --> 14:15.187
- YEAH.

14:15.271 --> 14:18.148
- AND YOU REALLY TRUST HER
TO DO THAT, DO YOU?

14:18.232 --> 14:19.400
AFTER EVERYTHING JOY'S DONE

14:19.483 --> 14:22.278
AND KNOWING HOW SHE FEELS
ABOUT NINA?

14:22.361 --> 14:24.863
- AMBER, ARE YOU SAYING THAT
I'D DELIBERATELY THROW THE GAME

14:24.947 --> 14:27.449
IN ORDER TO LEAVE NINA
DOWN THERE?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.076
- YES, ACTUALLY.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.578
- AMBER!

14:30.661 --> 14:32.454
- FINE.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.789
DO IT WITHOUT ME.

14:33.872 --> 14:34.832
- NO--NO--

14:34.915 --> 14:35.791
[sighs]

14:35.874 --> 14:37.960
- JOY!

14:38.043 --> 14:39.295
- WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

14:39.378 --> 14:40.379
- COME ON.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.256
WE WERE ALL THINKING IT.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.757
- OH, AMBER.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.260
- AMBER, WHY?

14:47.720 --> 14:50.097
- OKAY, MAYBE I WAS A BIT
OUT OF ORDER.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.266
I JUST DON'T THINK FABIAN
SHOULD'VE ASKED HER

14:52.349 --> 14:53.559
WITHOUT CHECKING FIRST.

14:53.642 --> 14:54.935
IT'S JUST NOT SIBUNA.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.190
- OH, HELLO, YOU TWO.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.692
- HEY, TRUDY.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.152
- THIS IS DR. ALEXANDER.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.280
HE'S HERE TO GIVE ME
A MEMORY THERAPY SESSION.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.865
- GOOD AFTERNOON.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.116
- UH, MEMORY THERAPY?

15:09.199 --> 15:12.995
AS IN, LIKE, MEMORY FOR
THE REMEMBERING OF THINGS?

15:13.078 --> 15:15.748
- THE KEY TO RECOVERING
BURIED MEMORIES

15:15.831 --> 15:19.335
IS DREAM INTERPRETATION
AND VISUALIZATION.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.170
IT'S A VERY PRECISE SCIENCE.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.296
- TRUDY, DO YOU THINK
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

15:22.379 --> 15:27.676
- I ASSURE YOU,
TRUDY IS IN EXCELLENT HANDS.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.637
- OKAY, BYE, THEN, YOU TWO.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.013
WISH ME LUCK.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.723
THIS WAY.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.858
- THAT SHOULD BE INTERESTING,
VERA.

15:42.941 --> 15:44.193
TRUDY GETTING HER MEMORY BACK.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.319
- YES.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.363
I HOPE IT ALL WORKS OUT FOR HER.

15:47.446 --> 15:51.867
I'LL JUST GO AND SEE
IF THEY NEED ANY REFRESHMENTS.

15:51.950 --> 15:54.244
- SHE DOESN'T SEEM
THE LEAST BIT BOTHERED.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.371
- IT'S WEIRD.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.207
DO YOU THINK
SHE'S UP TO SOMETHING?

15:58.290 --> 15:59.833
- SHE'S BREATHING, ISN'T SHE?

15:59.917 --> 16:02.127
SO I'D SAY SHE'S DEFINITELY
UP TO SOMETHING.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.837
- IT'S OUR DUTY TO FIND OUT.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.423
- OKAY, WE'RE STAKING HER OUT.

16:06.507 --> 16:09.718
- I ONLY SAID YES TO FABIAN
BECAUSE HE SOUNDED SO DESPERATE.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.929
BUT FOR AMBER TO ACTUALLY--

16:12.012 --> 16:13.555
- HE IS DESPERATE.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.391
WE ALL ARE.

16:15.474 --> 16:18.060
WE NEED YOU, JOY.
- REALLY?

16:18.143 --> 16:21.146
- REALLY, REALLY.

16:21.230 --> 16:21.563
[knock at door]

16:21.647 --> 16:23.524
COME IN.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.776
- HEY, UM...

16:25.859 --> 16:27.736
LOOK, ABOUT WHAT AMBER SAID--

16:27.820 --> 16:29.363
- IT'S OKAY.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.781
I'M STILL IN.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.994
- GREAT!

16:36.078 --> 16:38.247
- BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE ME DOWN THERE, THOUGH.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.582
I SHOULD REALLY SEE
THOSE STATUE THINGS FOR REAL.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.792
- OKAY, WELL, UM--
WE'LL GO DOWN TONIGHT.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.252
- OKAY.
- OKAY, AFTER DINNER?

16:43.335 --> 16:47.256
- AND IN THE MEANTIME,
BETTER GET PRACTICING SOME MORE.

16:47.339 --> 16:48.924
- THANK YOU.

16:49.007 --> 16:52.094
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.

16:52.177 --> 16:52.511
- OH.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.263
[laughs]

16:54.346 --> 16:55.472
- THANK YOU.
- MM.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.933
- ALL RIGHT, AMBER.

16:58.016 --> 16:59.685
- BYE.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.311
WELL, I GUESS
THERE'S SOME PERKS, THEN,

17:01.395 --> 17:02.855
TO THIS BEING KIND
AND HELPFUL THING.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.815
- OH, DON'T EVEN.

17:04.897 --> 17:06.442
- [giggles]

17:10.612 --> 17:13.531
- YES.

17:13.615 --> 17:16.743
YES, IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME.

17:19.246 --> 17:21.623
OH, YES.

17:21.707 --> 17:26.502
I HAVEN'T LOST MY TOUCH, ROBERT.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.131
- DELAWARE, FLORIDA, GEORGIA,

17:29.214 --> 17:31.550
HAWAII, IDAHO,
ILLINOIS, INDIANA.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.635
IOWA--

17:33.719 --> 17:36.221
- YOU ARE TRYING
TO KEEP YOUR MIND ACTIVE?

17:36.305 --> 17:37.181
- [sighs]

17:37.264 --> 17:39.600
YEP, THAT'S RIGHT.

17:39.683 --> 17:43.020
SO TELL ME
ABOUT THIS OSIRIAN.

17:43.103 --> 17:43.854
- MM.

17:43.937 --> 17:48.192
I'VE TOLD YOU ALL I KNOW.

17:48.275 --> 17:52.404
SARAH WAS THE CHOSEN ONE,
OF COURSE.

17:53.906 --> 17:57.409
- I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG,
KEEPING THE SECRET.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.452
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

17:58.535 --> 18:00.496
HERE, QUICK.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.414
TAKE THIS.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.833
BUT KEEP IT WELL HIDDEN.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.044
- THAT MAKES SENSE.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.129
- AND RUFUS ZENO, AN OSIRIAN.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.173
- RUFUS ZENO?
BUT HE--

18:11.256 --> 18:14.885
- IT ALL WENT TERRIBLY WRONG.

18:14.968 --> 18:18.096
THE POWER WENT TO HIS HEAD
SOMEWHAT.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.724
- NO KIDDING.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.602
- WELL?

18:23.685 --> 18:25.395
- SHH.

18:25.479 --> 18:28.023
- COME.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.115
WELL?

18:37.199 --> 18:38.283
- ALL DONE.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.077
SHE'S GONE TO HER ROOM
FOR A LIE-DOWN.

18:40.160 --> 18:40.536
- DID IT WORK?

18:40.619 --> 18:42.871
- YES.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.707
ANY RESIDUAL MEMORIES GONE,
FAKE MEMORIES PLANTED.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.000
- EXCELLENT.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.670
AND NOW YOU NEED TO SHOW ME
HOW IT'S DONE.

18:49.753 --> 18:51.505
I WANT TO MESMERIZE THOSE BRATS.

18:51.588 --> 18:52.673
GET THEM UNDER MY CONTROL.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.383
FINISH THIS THING
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.553
- AN EGYPTIAN MEMORY BOX:

18:57.636 --> 18:59.429
MY SECRET WEAPON.

18:59.513 --> 19:02.224
THIS IS THE MEMORY BOX
I USED ON TRUDY.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.476
IT'S BASED ON
ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MEMORY.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.729
YOUR STUDENTS MUST ACCEPT
THE BOX AS A GIFT,

19:07.813 --> 19:10.274
AND BELIEVE IN ITS POWER.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.900
- WHEN THEY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO TRUDY,

19:11.984 --> 19:16.071
HOW CAN THEY NOT BELIEVE?

19:16.154 --> 19:19.908
- YOU CAN RELEASE THEM
WITH THESE WORDS.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.037
- THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

19:24.121 --> 19:25.747
NOW, I'D BETTER CHECK ON TRUDY.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.125
YOU GO OUT THE BACK WAY.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.929
- [gasps]

19:41.013 --> 19:45.142
DR. ALEXANDER
HAS WORKED WONDERS!

19:45.225 --> 19:47.769
[gasps]

19:47.853 --> 19:51.148
OH, WELL--WELL,
SHALL I HELP YOU WITH DINNER?

19:51.231 --> 19:52.941
OR MAYBE I COULD FINISH
THE LAUNDRY.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.276
- OH, THAT'S VERY KIND
OF YOU, TRUDY.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.944
UH, SHOULDN'T YOU BE RESTING?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.154
- OH, NO NEED.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.196
I FEEL ON TOP OF THE WORLD.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.625
HE GAVE ME THIS MEMORY BOX,

20:09.708 --> 20:12.169
AND THEN HE ASKED ME
TO CLOSE MY EYES AND RELAX

20:12.252 --> 20:17.174
AND EMPTY ALL MY THOUGHTS
INTO THE BOX.

20:17.257 --> 20:18.508
AND THEN WE JUST--

20:18.592 --> 20:20.636
WE JUST PUT THEM ALL BACK
IN THE RIGHT ORDER.

20:20.719 --> 20:21.053
- BUT DID IT WORK?

20:21.136 --> 20:22.846
- YES!

20:22.930 --> 20:25.307
I REMEMBER
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.808
- REALLY?
REALLY!

20:26.892 --> 20:31.980
- I REMEMBER THE BEACH
AND THE HOTEL--OH, AND THE FOOD.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.148
OH, THE FOOD WAS TO DIE FOR.

20:33.231 --> 20:34.149
- THE BEACH?

20:34.232 --> 20:35.275
- A HOTEL?

20:35.359 --> 20:36.401
- YES!

20:36.485 --> 20:37.653
MY VACATION.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.697
SUCH A SHAME TO LET
A BRANCH FALLING ON MY HEAD

20:40.781 --> 20:45.077
BLOT OUT THE HOLIDAY
OF A LIFETIME.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.495
- WHAT?

20:46.578 --> 20:48.163
- UH, WHERE HAVE YOU TWO BEEN?

20:48.246 --> 20:49.665
- FABIAN, YOU NEED TO COME
AND HELP.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.416
- HELP WITH WHAT?
CAN'T IT WAIT?

20:51.500 --> 20:52.834
- AFRAID NOT.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.712
- ALFIE'S, UM, SCIENCE
EXPERIMENT MALFUNCTIONED.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.047
- AGAIN.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.006
- OH, WANT ME TO HAVE A LOOK?
- NO!

20:58.090 --> 21:00.717
JUST PATRICIA AND FABIAN.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.683
- OKAY.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.188
- I'M SENSING THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH A SCIENCE PROJECT.

21:13.271 --> 21:14.648
- DID VERA HAND YOU
A STRANGE BOX AT ALL?

21:14.731 --> 21:16.400
- OR START CHANTING
OVER THE POTATOES?

21:16.483 --> 21:16.817
- UH, NO.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.527
- PHEW.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.903
- WHAT--WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

21:19.987 --> 21:22.197
- TRUDY'S MEMORY GUY
ISN'T A DOCTOR AT ALL.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.949
HE'S A CROOK, A FAKE, A CHEAT,
A FRAUD, A QUACK.

21:24.032 --> 21:25.993
- I THINK THEY GET IT, AMBER.

21:26.076 --> 21:27.369
VERA WANTS TO CONTROL US.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.286
SHE SAID SO.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.496
- I'D LIKE TO SEE HER TRY.

21:29.579 --> 21:31.081
- BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHY.

21:31.164 --> 21:32.708
- LOOK, I SAW VICTOR PLAYING
SENET EARLIER, AND HE'S GOOD.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.584
- SO WHAT?

21:34.668 --> 21:35.794
WE FIRE JOY, AND HIRE VICTOR?

21:35.877 --> 21:37.295
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW GOOD HE IS.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.881
HE CAN'T PLAY ON HIS OWN.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.551
YOU THINK THEY NEED PAWNS?

21:42.634 --> 21:46.263
- OH, WELL, EXCUSE ME,
BUT I'M NOBODY'S PAWN.

21:46.346 --> 21:49.558
THEY SAID THE MEMORY BOX ROUTINE
WORKED ON TRUDY.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.434
- IT DID.

21:50.517 --> 21:53.186
SHE'S TOTALLY REPROGRAMMED.

21:53.270 --> 21:55.522
- AND THEY WANT TO DO THE SAME
TO US.

22:02.571 --> 22:03.655
- YES!

22:03.739 --> 22:05.073
TAKE THAT, DOG FACE.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.575
HA! YAY.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.285
- YOU'RE SHOWING REMARKABLE
DEDICATION TO THE CAUSE, JOY,

22:08.368 --> 22:11.747
BUT I REALLY DO
NEED TO BE LOCKING UP.

22:11.830 --> 22:12.789
- ONE MORE GAME.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.041
JUST ONE MORE.

22:14.124 --> 22:17.044
PROMISE.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.837
- AH, SORRY.
NO MORE VISITORS.

22:18.920 --> 22:19.629
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO CLOSE.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.090
- FORGOTTEN ME ALREADY, JASPER?

22:22.174 --> 22:24.634
YOU WOULD DO WELL TO REMEMBER.
