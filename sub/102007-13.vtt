much less cowboy boots.

African American male.

11:07.893 --> 11:10.669

Signs of rigor.

Lividity...

sudden stroke.

11:17.493 --> 11:19.585
But there were no indicators.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.663
Most likely an aneurysm.

11:22.683 --> 11:26.426

from his medical history, he...

11:26.578 --> 11:28.335
was healthy.

that's the surest way

14:05.737 --> 14:07.737
to get a girl pregnant, huh?

14:07.755 --> 14:09.330
What would I do without you?

14:09.349 --> 14:13.351
You're never gonna have
to find out. Never.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.064
(exhales)

14:19.842 --> 14:21.693
(sniffles)

14:23.804 --> 14:25.755
(sighs)

14:25.773 --> 14:28.015
OWEN:
Captain Vega?

14:28.034 --> 14:30.776
(sighs)
Captain Strand.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.612
Are you okay?

14:32.706 --> 14:34.280
Are you experiencing any--

14:34.432 --> 14:37.191
I don't know-- complications
from the fire last night?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.951
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
This is just a checkup

14:39.104 --> 14:40.694
-for my cancer surgery today.
-Oh.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.713
What are you doing here?

14:41.864 --> 14:43.289
Oh, I, um...

14:43.441 --> 14:46.367
I have a relative who's getting
a procedure downstairs.

14:46.461 --> 14:48.294
Oh. Hope it's not too serious.

14:48.446 --> 14:50.204
Routine.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.224
Well, I'm around
if you need anything.

14:53.451 --> 14:55.785
Oh, heard they make a mean
tapioca in the commissary.

14:55.803 --> 14:59.731
Oh, I'll pass,
but I appreciate it.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.139
<i> -(door opens)</i>
<i> -JUDD: Hey, hey.</i>

15:16.232 --> 15:18.324
-We're home.
-GRACE: There they go.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.477
Hey, girls.
Come give godmama a hug.

15:21.496 --> 15:24.088
Mwah. Mwah.
Y'all look so cute.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.498
-Ms. Grace?
-Mm-hmm.

15:25.650 --> 15:27.074
Can we play video games?
Mr. Judd said

15:27.168 --> 15:28.742
we can play video games.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.095
No, I said after your homework.

15:31.247 --> 15:33.264
That's right. Listen, head
to the bathroom and wash up.

15:33.416 --> 15:35.433
We're gonna fix you guys
something to drink, okay?

15:35.584 --> 15:36.826
GIRLS:
Okay.

15:36.844 --> 15:39.345
-Mm-hmm.
-(sighs)

15:39.497 --> 15:40.605
(Judd chuckles)

15:40.756 --> 15:43.441
Listen,
did they give you any idea

15:43.668 --> 15:45.017
about what's going on
with Tommy?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.019
No. They said
that Charles was gone

15:47.113 --> 15:48.521
when they woke up
this morning.

15:48.673 --> 15:50.189
-Gone? Gone where?
-I don't know.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.932
Evie mentioned
she thought she heard

15:52.026 --> 15:53.767
a car pulling out
of the driveway last night.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.178
In the middle of the night,
Judd?

15:55.196 --> 15:57.438
-That's what she said.
-Okay.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.682
You don't think Tommy and
Charles are fighting, do you?

15:59.701 --> 16:01.684
They're not really the type,
but I don't know.

16:01.777 --> 16:03.610
Everybody does it, you know?

16:03.630 --> 16:06.205
-I texted Charles.
-And?

16:06.357 --> 16:07.632
Nothing.

16:09.377 --> 16:11.094
(exhales)

16:16.792 --> 16:18.792
You mind if I sit here? I...

16:18.812 --> 16:20.870
I mean, I can put this on
if you want.

16:20.888 --> 16:22.388
No, no, don't worry about that.

16:22.540 --> 16:25.374
Whole reason I came out here was
so I didn't have to wear one.

16:25.393 --> 16:27.210
(sighs)

16:27.228 --> 16:29.378
I'm fully vaccinated,

16:29.397 --> 16:30.822
for whatever that's worth.

16:30.973 --> 16:32.473
Me, too.

16:32.567 --> 16:35.809
You know,
I was just thinking about

16:35.829 --> 16:39.080
what am I gonna do with
all these once this is all over?

16:41.726 --> 16:43.743
Maybe I'll make
a really ugly quilt,

16:43.895 --> 16:45.819
which I could do, by the way.

16:45.839 --> 16:51.492
Because I learned
how to sew during the pandemic.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.070
And bake my own bread.

16:54.163 --> 16:57.548
Maybe too well, actually.

16:57.700 --> 17:01.077
It's so funny. I...

17:01.170 --> 17:05.398
I never really worried
about the apocalypse at all.

17:06.918 --> 17:09.235
I actually enjoyed it.

17:11.923 --> 17:13.089
So it's kind of fitting,

17:13.107 --> 17:15.033
now that the world's
all coming back,

17:15.260 --> 17:17.285
that my world...

17:18.062 --> 17:20.329
My world's falling apart.

17:23.692 --> 17:25.785
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:25.937 --> 17:30.331
(sniffles)
You know, they want me
to say goodbye.

17:30.441 --> 17:32.759
I can't say goodbye. I c...

17:34.370 --> 17:36.445
I'm sorry.

17:36.464 --> 17:38.964
Oh, don't be.

17:39.117 --> 17:42.393
Uh, my name's Tommy.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.972
Uh, George.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.292
Who are you here for, George?

17:49.385 --> 17:51.360
My son.

17:53.798 --> 17:57.108
My boy, Ethan, he's...
(sniffles, clears throat)

17:57.260 --> 17:58.968
He's in the ICU, and, uh,

17:59.061 --> 18:02.896
it's not the first time he's...

18:02.916 --> 18:05.083
Ethan's had seizures,

18:05.234 --> 18:07.901
uh, his whole life,
since he was little.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.755
-(sighs)
-That's rough.

18:11.833 --> 18:13.816
(sniffles)

18:13.909 --> 18:15.835
You know, this time, it was...

18:15.929 --> 18:18.412
This time,
it was just really bad.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.581
He had a seizure that...
(sniffles)

18:20.600 --> 18:22.174
...that just wouldn't stop.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.103
It's like a cascade of seizures
is what the doctors think.

18:25.254 --> 18:28.088
Status epilepticus.

18:28.182 --> 18:30.274
I'm a paramedic.

18:30.426 --> 18:32.017
Ah.

18:32.170 --> 18:33.945
And he was alone, which is...

18:34.096 --> 18:35.762
I mean, he has roommates,
but they weren't home,

18:35.824 --> 18:37.990
and they found him
in the bathroom.

18:40.269 --> 18:43.028
(sniffles, clears throat)

18:43.123 --> 18:46.374
My son has been
in a coma for two weeks.

18:47.702 --> 18:51.354
And now, the doctors are saying
that, you know,

18:51.447 --> 18:54.298
he's just not gonna wake up.

18:56.194 --> 18:59.303
I'm so sorry.

18:59.530 --> 19:02.882
And today, they wanted
to put him on, uh, they call it

19:03.034 --> 19:04.884
"a terminal wean," which, like,

19:05.036 --> 19:10.231
in doctor speak is, like,
uh, you know, unplugging him.

19:14.470 --> 19:18.322
And worst part-- I haven't
been up there once, at all.

19:18.474 --> 19:20.065
I just, I...

19:20.160 --> 19:22.385
I can't. I just...

19:22.403 --> 19:25.663
Every time I try and find the
courage to go up there, I...

19:25.814 --> 19:28.574
I'm just... I'm terrified

19:28.668 --> 19:32.295
at what will happen
if I walk in there.

19:33.155 --> 19:35.339
It'll become real.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.429
Yeah.

19:46.686 --> 19:50.579
If I loved my son,
I would be up there right now.

19:50.673 --> 19:52.765
But I'm a coward.

19:52.917 --> 19:55.008
I'm just gonna let
this moment pass,

19:55.102 --> 19:58.771
just like every other important
moment in my life, and...

19:58.923 --> 20:00.773
and I'm gonna regret it.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.591
I know I'm gonna regret it.

20:02.610 --> 20:04.202
I don't know what to do, okay?
(panting)

20:04.353 --> 20:06.111
I don't know what to do.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.280
Well, you're here.

20:08.433 --> 20:10.599
Just go upstairs,
see your son.

20:10.693 --> 20:12.935
No, I can't.

20:12.954 --> 20:14.528
I really can't.
I mean, I'm...

20:14.547 --> 20:16.272
I think I'm gonna pass out
before I get

20:16.365 --> 20:18.198
-to the door if I do that. I...
-Well, then it's a good thing

20:18.292 --> 20:20.760
that you sat next
to a paramedic, isn't it?

20:22.630 --> 20:24.538
Come on.

20:24.632 --> 20:26.432
I'll walk you up there.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.376
(laughs, sniffles)

20:29.395 --> 20:32.471
<i> (indistinct P.A. announcement)</i>

20:32.565 --> 20:34.457
How you feeling, George?

20:34.475 --> 20:36.234
Like my feet are cemented
to the floor.

20:36.461 --> 20:40.363
Well, just a...
just a few more feet and...

20:43.743 --> 20:46.393
Do you want me
to go in with you?

20:46.487 --> 20:48.079
Uh, no, no, no.

20:48.230 --> 20:49.488
Uh, you-you should go,
but, uh...

20:49.640 --> 20:51.991
but thank you
for getting me here.

20:52.143 --> 20:53.567
(door opens)

20:53.661 --> 20:56.328
-George. What the hell
are you doing here?
-I think you know

20:56.481 --> 20:57.830
exactly what I'm doing here.
He's my son, too, Clara.

20:57.982 --> 20:59.406
You are not allowed
to be here today.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.775
-You're gonna
get yourself arrested!
-Yeah, well,

21:00.777 --> 21:02.093
I'm pretty sure that's true.

21:02.244 --> 21:04.411
-George, you need to go.
-I need to go? Uh, no.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.654
You need to go.

21:05.748 --> 21:07.656
-You all need to go!
Everybody out!
-George.

21:07.675 --> 21:09.008
Have you lost your mind?

21:09.160 --> 21:10.601
I'm not gonna let you
kill our son.

21:10.753 --> 21:14.605
We're not killing him!
We're letting him go.

21:14.757 --> 21:17.108
-Move!
-And what if I don't?

21:18.111 --> 21:20.927
George, you don't want
to do this.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.262
You were always so ready
to give up on him.

21:22.282 --> 21:25.116
It's not Ethan I gave up on,
George. It's you.

21:25.952 --> 21:30.529
Ma'am, it might be a good idea

21:30.623 --> 21:33.106
if-if y'all just stepped out

21:33.200 --> 21:35.200
and-and let George
have a moment with his son.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.353
And who the hell are you?

21:37.371 --> 21:38.871
TOMMY:
I'm just somebody

21:39.023 --> 21:41.448
who doesn't want
anyone to get hurt.

21:42.209 --> 21:45.469
Okay? Safest move
for everyone in this room

21:45.696 --> 21:46.787
and this hospital

21:46.881 --> 21:50.215
if you just go outside.
Just for now.

21:50.368 --> 21:52.810
She's right. Clara, come on.

21:53.037 --> 21:55.371
-Come on.
-GEORGE: Where you going?

21:55.464 --> 21:58.399
-CLARA: Going
to say goodbye to my son.
-Wait.

22:02.046 --> 22:04.322
Goodbye, my precious boy.

22:07.568 --> 22:11.078
I love you so much.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.414
(kisses)

22:16.336 --> 22:19.211
I will always hate you for this.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.233
-George...
-I told you

22:24.326 --> 22:26.159
to leave. What's-what's going on
with the machines?

22:26.253 --> 22:27.661
Are they on?
Turn them back on right now.

22:27.755 --> 22:29.421
-Turn them on!
-George, just let her
walk out of here,

22:29.574 --> 22:30.739
okay?
I can handle the ventilator.

22:30.833 --> 22:33.258
Okay, just go. You, go.

22:33.411 --> 22:34.927
Ethan.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.855
Ethan, it's Dad. I'm here now.

22:38.082 --> 22:39.748
Everything's gonna be just fine.

22:39.842 --> 22:40.841
Is it?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.601
How long do you think
you'll be able

22:42.753 --> 22:44.010
to hold off the police
with a toy gun?

22:44.105 --> 22:45.270
Yeah.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.180
We walked through
the metal detectors together.

22:47.274 --> 22:50.368
-I didn't want
anyone to get hurt.
-TOMMY: Right.

22:51.854 --> 22:55.247
-(ventilator beeps, whirring)
-Let's hope that works out.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.967
JACOBS:
Okay, one last pinch.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.536
How's it look?

23:09.630 --> 23:10.796
Looks great.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.798
The incision
is well-approximated,

23:12.950 --> 23:15.726
which means that it's
closing nicely. There's no sign

23:15.953 --> 23:19.138
of swelling.
No infection, no redness.

23:19.290 --> 23:21.974
You know,
other than these patches here,

23:22.126 --> 23:23.901
which I don't believe are mine.

23:24.128 --> 23:25.385
You know,

23:25.405 --> 23:26.737
if, uh, I didn't know better,

23:26.964 --> 23:29.055
I'd say
they look a little like burns.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.742
Any idea where they came from?

23:31.894 --> 23:33.577
-I-I plead the fifth.
-Oh.

23:33.804 --> 23:35.988
I thought I told you
not to go back to work

23:36.140 --> 23:38.064
till at least four weeks
after the surgery.

23:38.159 --> 23:39.491
-I didn't go back to work.
-Oh.

23:39.644 --> 23:42.586
So you just do this sort
of thing recreationally?

23:42.813 --> 23:44.496
You know what, no. Mm-mm.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.239
I do not want to know.

23:46.333 --> 23:48.150
(chuckles)

23:48.169 --> 23:51.745
You clearly lead
a very exciting life, Owen.

23:51.764 --> 23:54.506
Sometimes a little too exciting.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.583
(chuckles)

23:56.602 --> 23:58.269
You know what?

23:58.496 --> 24:01.847
Actually, I would like to know.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.423
Really? Well, it's a...

24:03.443 --> 24:05.834
-It's a kind of long,
complicated story.
-Okay.

24:05.853 --> 24:07.336
Well, no worries.

24:07.354 --> 24:08.762
But I'd love to tell it to you.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.114
Maybe over a coffee?

24:10.341 --> 24:12.616
I'm sorry. The...
You're a doctor.

24:12.768 --> 24:15.344
You probably can't go to coffee
with a patient.

24:15.362 --> 24:17.362
Hmm. Well,

24:17.515 --> 24:20.349
the good news is you are
no longer my patient, so...

24:20.367 --> 24:21.942
Why don't you call me Barbara?

24:21.994 --> 24:24.536
-(intercom beeps)
<i> -MAN: Paging Dr. White</i>
<i> and Dr. Violet.</i>

24:24.630 --> 24:25.871
<i> Dr. White and Dr. Violet</i>

24:25.965 --> 24:27.614
<i> to the ICU immediately.</i>

24:27.633 --> 24:28.949
Oh, wow.

24:29.043 --> 24:30.242
-Okay.
-What's that?

24:30.303 --> 24:31.451
Uh, "Dr. White" is code

24:31.545 --> 24:32.695
for the staff
to evacuate the hospital.

24:32.713 --> 24:35.047
Wh-What's a code violet?

24:35.199 --> 24:37.349
A hostage situation.
We need to go.

24:38.627 --> 24:40.060
(siren wailing)

24:45.926 --> 24:47.226
TYLER:
Let's go, let's go.

24:47.378 --> 24:48.560
Gather it in. Let's go!

24:48.713 --> 24:49.987
Bring it right here
in the middle, everybody.

24:50.214 --> 24:52.881
We have a potential shooter
in the ICU unit.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.216
If this guy wants
to get out of here,

24:54.235 --> 24:55.809
he's gonna have
to come through us.

24:55.903 --> 24:58.570
-(monitor beeping steadily)
-Ethan.

24:58.723 --> 24:59.646
Hey, Big E.

24:59.665 --> 25:00.814
I know you can hear me.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.333
You got to hurry back, buddy.

25:02.484 --> 25:04.126
(phone buzzing)

25:07.673 --> 25:08.839
Owen.

25:09.066 --> 25:11.066
OWEN:
Hey. Are you still here?

25:11.159 --> 25:12.584
<i> TOMMY:</i>
<i> In the hospital? Yes.</i>

25:12.678 --> 25:14.160
OWEN:
There's an alert.
They're evacuating

25:14.180 --> 25:16.755
everybody below the ICU.
There's a gunman.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.015
Yes, I'm-I'm aware.

25:18.166 --> 25:21.334
-I'm looking right at him.
<i> -What?</i>

25:21.428 --> 25:24.079
I'm fine, Owen. It's a toy gun.

25:24.098 --> 25:25.581
-How do you know that?
<i> -Just trust me.</i>

25:25.599 --> 25:27.082
<i> The guy's</i>
<i> a little off his rocker,</i>

25:27.101 --> 25:28.917
<i> but he's harmless. He's just</i>

25:28.936 --> 25:30.194
a distraught dad
that doesn't want

25:30.345 --> 25:31.570
the hospital to take his son

25:31.680 --> 25:33.013
<i> -off life support.</i>
-Well, I can promise you

25:33.032 --> 25:34.940
the SWAT team
won't be using toy guns.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.535
Which is why I need you
to buy me some time.

25:37.686 --> 25:40.262
-For what?
<i> -I think I can talk him down.</i>

25:40.281 --> 25:42.522
-Tommy...
<i> -I walked him in.</i>

25:42.616 --> 25:43.907
I can walk him out.

25:44.060 --> 25:45.209
What do you mean,
you walked him in?

25:45.360 --> 25:47.995
<i> Nobody has to get hurt today,</i>
<i> Owen.</i>

25:48.105 --> 25:49.863
Please.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.882
Just a little more time.

25:52.034 --> 25:54.610
I'll see what I can do.

25:54.628 --> 25:56.720
-TOMMY: George.
-Yeah.

25:56.872 --> 25:57.888
We don't have long,

25:58.115 --> 25:59.723
so I really need you
to listen to me.

25:59.875 --> 26:02.542
-You have to surrender now.
-No.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.970
I can't do that. I can't.
Ethan is counting on me.

26:05.122 --> 26:07.213
They come through that door,
they're gonna kill him. No.

26:07.308 --> 26:09.291
You said you didn't want
anyone getting hurt today.

26:09.384 --> 26:10.901
If you don't surrender
right now,

26:11.128 --> 26:13.404
people are gonna get hurt,
starting with you.

26:13.555 --> 26:16.056
I don't care about me.
You're right. You need to go.

26:16.150 --> 26:18.634
Thank you
for giving my son a chance.

26:18.652 --> 26:21.002
George,

26:21.004 --> 26:23.730
your boy has been
in a vegetative state

26:23.749 --> 26:25.398
for two weeks.

26:26.160 --> 26:29.903
Okay? The odds are
that he's not coming out of it.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.481
Especially not
in the next few minutes.

26:32.499 --> 26:34.258
When Ethan was 13,

26:34.409 --> 26:36.927
he went over to a friend's house
after school to play.

26:37.079 --> 26:39.913
And they decided to go swimming.
We had no idea.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.765
Clara and I didn't even know
they had a pool.

26:41.917 --> 26:43.083
And Ethan had a seizure,

26:43.177 --> 26:45.251
and all the air came out
of his lungs, and he sank

26:45.313 --> 26:47.496
to the bottom. Took his friends
five minutes to pull him out.

26:47.589 --> 26:49.514
It's a miracle
he didn't drown himself.

26:49.667 --> 26:50.833
The doctor said,

26:50.926 --> 26:52.926
"He's probably not
gonna wake up."

26:52.945 --> 26:55.279
And even if he did,
he wouldn't be the same.

26:55.506 --> 26:57.506
And guess what? The next day,

26:57.524 --> 27:00.075
he came out of it.

27:00.845 --> 27:03.245
My son's a fighter.

27:04.106 --> 27:07.041
That's an incredible story.

27:07.852 --> 27:10.110
But 12 hours,

27:10.129 --> 27:13.964
it's a lot different
from two weeks.

27:14.634 --> 27:17.192
What would you do?

27:17.285 --> 27:19.136
Hmm?

27:19.287 --> 27:20.471
If this was your loved one,
what would you do

27:20.622 --> 27:22.714
to give them
just even a minute more

27:22.867 --> 27:24.266
for a chance at a miracle?

27:28.706 --> 27:30.856
Anything.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.466
-(George sniffles)
-Anything.

27:34.395 --> 27:36.987
-(siren wailing)
<i> -TYLER: Make sure</i>
<i> the first two floors</i>

27:37.139 --> 27:38.563
are cleared,
the stairwells secured.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.807
-MAN: Let's go. Move, move.
-TYLER: Radio Echo Team.

27:40.826 --> 27:43.735
Have them put shooters
on every rooftop

27:43.888 --> 27:45.812
with a clear line of sight to
the south side of this building.

27:45.906 --> 27:47.406
Officer, all civilians

27:47.558 --> 27:49.149
have to be on the other side
of the barricades.

27:49.168 --> 27:52.002
I'm not a civilian. I'm
Captain Owen Strand, Austin FD.

27:52.229 --> 27:53.820
I have some information
on your suspect.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.989
-TYLER: Lieutenant Jeff Tyler.
-A colleague of mine,

27:56.008 --> 27:58.233
Paramedic Captain Tommy Vega,
called me.

27:58.252 --> 28:00.569
She is inside with him
right now.

28:00.587 --> 28:03.739
-She's a hostage?
-No, no. He's not holding her.

28:03.832 --> 28:05.240
And she says he's armed
with a toy gun.

28:05.333 --> 28:07.092
But that's not something
that I can assume to be true.

28:07.244 --> 28:08.410
I understand that.

28:08.579 --> 28:10.429
She's asking for some time
to get him to surrender.

28:10.523 --> 28:13.098
-The man commandeered an ICU.
-I know

28:13.250 --> 28:14.841
you don't know me,
but I do know her.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.769
Captain Vega
is asking for some time.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.197
I think
we should give it to her.

28:22.626 --> 28:24.702
(phone buzzing)

28:29.191 --> 28:30.115
Owen.

28:30.267 --> 28:32.042
Hey. I spoke
to SWAT Commander Tyler.

28:32.269 --> 28:33.769
He's agreed
to stand his team down.

28:33.862 --> 28:36.714
You have ten minutes to try
to get that guy out of there.

28:36.865 --> 28:38.215
You do get results.

28:38.442 --> 28:39.717
I do what I can.

28:39.868 --> 28:42.961
<i>And please pass my thanks along</i>
<i> to the lieutenant.</i>

28:43.113 --> 28:46.098
But things have changed here.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.376
We're not coming out
of this room.

28:50.471 --> 28:52.354
Sorry.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.631
JUDD:
Did you put in a cheat code
while I wasn't looking?

29:02.649 --> 29:03.741
EVIE:
No. I don't cheat.

29:03.968 --> 29:05.576
Well, you must be
a black belt, then.

29:05.727 --> 29:09.362
-But either way, it ain't fair.
-"Ain't" is not a word,
Mr. Judd.

29:09.473 --> 29:11.974
Our mom says we shouldn't whine.

29:12.067 --> 29:13.250
-Well...
-GRACE: They got
your number, Judd.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.901
JUDD:
Why don't you guys take each
other on

29:14.920 --> 29:16.420
-if you're so tough.
-(phone ringing)

29:16.571 --> 29:18.480
Hey. What's going on?

29:18.499 --> 29:20.740
-Have you talked to Tommy today?
<i> -Yeah. Actually,</i>

29:20.760 --> 29:23.260
uh, Grace and I are watching
the girls right now.

29:23.487 --> 29:25.821
-Why? It's Cap.
<i> -She said that she was here</i>

29:25.914 --> 29:27.097
because she had a relative

29:27.249 --> 29:29.157
who was getting
some sort of procedure done?

29:29.176 --> 29:31.935
-Wait, where-where's here?
<i> -St. Raymond's. Look,</i>

29:32.087 --> 29:33.419
what relatives of her
live here in town?

29:33.439 --> 29:35.606
It's just her and Charles.
I mean, that-that's why

29:35.833 --> 29:37.165
we're babysitting the girls now.

29:37.184 --> 29:39.334
<i> -What's going on, Owen?</i>
-I don't know.

29:39.427 --> 29:41.111
But something's not right
with her.

29:41.263 --> 29:42.854
Otherwise,
I doubt she'd be in the middle

29:43.007 --> 29:44.615
of a police standoff right now.

29:44.766 --> 29:46.099
A what now?

29:46.160 --> 29:48.026
Yeah. And I talked to her
20 minutes ago.

29:48.178 --> 29:49.745
Now she's not picking up
my calls.

29:51.439 --> 29:54.199
Whatever you do,
stay away from this window.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.277
What, you mean
they'd actually, uh...

29:57.296 --> 29:59.445
I mean, w-without even talking
to us first?

29:59.465 --> 30:01.206
Well, we're playing
for keeps now.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.691
They'll be here soon.

30:02.709 --> 30:03.967
So let's barricade the door.

30:04.119 --> 30:06.136
There's no point.
When they come, they come.

30:06.288 --> 30:07.529
So what else we can do?

30:07.548 --> 30:08.713
Pray.

30:08.866 --> 30:10.766
(phone buzzing)

30:12.961 --> 30:14.052
-(line beeps)
-(sighs)

30:14.146 --> 30:16.038
She's not picking up
for me, either.

30:16.056 --> 30:18.482
I mean,
this don't make no sense.

30:18.633 --> 30:20.058
You know?
And what the hell relative

30:20.152 --> 30:21.710
is she visiting
at the hospital anyway?

30:21.728 --> 30:24.154
GRACE:
You know what?
It's like you said.

30:24.306 --> 30:26.898
Tommy has one relative
that's in town that is not

30:27.051 --> 30:28.641
in this room right now.

30:28.661 --> 30:31.278
-Gotcha.
-Nuh-uh.

30:31.388 --> 30:32.737
Charles.

30:32.981 --> 30:35.315
What if the car that Evie heard
in the driveway last night...

30:35.442 --> 30:38.418
What if it was an ambulance?

30:39.563 --> 30:41.413
-(phone rings)
-BREE: Austin Emergency.

30:41.507 --> 30:43.156
-This is Bree.
<i> -GRACE: Hey, Bree.</i>

30:43.175 --> 30:44.900
<i> -This is Grace.</i>
-Grace. What can I do for you?

30:44.918 --> 30:46.659
<i> Uh, listen, I have a bit</i>

30:46.679 --> 30:47.752
of a strange request.

30:47.905 --> 30:49.421
Could you tell me
if any 911 calls

30:49.573 --> 30:50.514
came in last night

30:50.665 --> 30:51.664
from a residence?

30:51.725 --> 30:53.742
<i> 5674 Merriman Drive?</i>

30:53.760 --> 30:56.411
Yep. Looks like one
did come in from there.

30:56.430 --> 30:57.579
<i> 3:18 a.m.</i>

30:57.598 --> 31:00.265
Bree, I need you
to play it for me, please.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.009
-Yep.
<i> -DISPATCHER: 911.</i>
<i> What's your emergency?</i>

31:03.028 --> 31:06.179
<i> TOMMY:</i>
<i> I'm at 5674 Merriman Drive.</i>

31:06.198 --> 31:10.592
<i> I have a nonresponsive</i>
<i> 50-year-old male.</i>

31:10.611 --> 31:13.871
<i> No pulse.</i>
<i> No reaction to sternal rub.</i>

31:14.098 --> 31:17.190
<i> I need</i>
<i> cardiac life support here now.</i>

31:17.209 --> 31:18.934
<i> DISPATCHER:</i>
<i> Help is on the way, ma'am.</i>
<i> Can you tell me</i>

31:18.952 --> 31:20.285
<i> -if he's breathing?</i>
<i> -TOMMY: No.</i>

31:20.379 --> 31:22.104
<i> His airways are clear,</i>
<i> but no respiration.</i>

31:22.122 --> 31:24.339
<i> (sniffles)</i>
<i> Starting compressions.</i>

31:25.626 --> 31:27.200
<i> Come on, Charles. Please.</i>

31:27.294 --> 31:30.888
<i> Please, come on.</i>
<i> Come on, Charles. Come on.</i>

31:31.115 --> 31:32.556
<i> DISPATCHER:</i>
<i> Paramedics will be with you</i>

31:32.749 --> 31:34.182
<i> within six minutes.</i>

31:35.060 --> 31:37.227
<i> TOMMY:</i>
<i> No need to hurry.</i>

31:37.454 --> 31:39.638
<i> -DISPATCHER: I'm sorry?</i>
<i> -TOMMY: No pulse.</i>

31:39.732 --> 31:42.608
<i> Cool to the touch.</i>

31:43.903 --> 31:46.737
-(mouths)
<i> -Rigor has started to set in.</i>

31:47.965 --> 31:50.741
<i>Patient is beyond resuscitation.</i>

31:51.802 --> 31:54.661
<i> Tell the responders</i>
<i> no lights, no sirens.</i>

31:56.415 --> 31:58.624
<i> I don't want to wake my kids.</i>

32:02.813 --> 32:05.339
Breach on me. Three.

32:06.408 --> 32:07.925
Two. One.

32:08.076 --> 32:09.593
OWEN:
Stop! Stop.

32:09.820 --> 32:12.003
Don't go in there yet.
I know what's wrong with her.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.822
With-with Tommy.
And I think I can get them

32:13.915 --> 32:16.416
to come out peacefully, but
I've got to talk to her alone.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.676
TYLER:
Look, you go in there,

32:17.828 --> 32:19.603
and I can't protect you.

32:19.754 --> 32:22.064
-OWEN: I'll take my chances.
-You have two minutes.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.502
(knocking)

32:27.521 --> 32:28.946
Tommy, it's Owen.

32:29.097 --> 32:31.448
I'm alone, and I'm coming in.

32:34.861 --> 32:37.037
(monitor beeping steadily)

32:42.277 --> 32:43.961
Hey.

32:44.855 --> 32:46.279
You shouldn't be here, Owen.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.780
None of us should be here.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.449
But we're here.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.710
-Who is this?
-My name is Owen,

32:51.862 --> 32:54.529
and I'm very sorry
for what you're going through.

32:54.548 --> 32:56.364
I-I really, really am.

32:56.458 --> 32:58.366
But I've come to save my friend.

32:58.385 --> 32:59.701
I'm fine.

32:59.794 --> 33:01.645
You are not fine.

33:01.796 --> 33:04.630
Nothing about this is fine.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.541
It's brave.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.059
It's noble.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.228
And I understand it.

33:11.097 --> 33:12.731
You want this man
to be able to experience

33:12.883 --> 33:14.741
the miracle you didn't get to.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.997
What's he talking about?

33:21.725 --> 33:24.167
Her husband died.

33:24.895 --> 33:27.295
This morning.

33:29.583 --> 33:31.174
Last night.

33:31.401 --> 33:33.135
OWEN:
Last night.

33:33.904 --> 33:34.845
And you weren't there.

33:34.996 --> 33:38.223
