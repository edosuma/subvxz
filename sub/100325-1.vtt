this might help.

-Hiding?

-Huh.
-Pretending to be offended

05:49.087 --> 05:51.046
by Dr. "First Name Only"
when, really,

05:51.089 --> 05:52.961
you don't wanna accept
a Lifetime Achievement Award,

05:53.004 --> 05:54.397
because that means
you'd have to admit

05:54.441 --> 05:56.051
you're closer to the end
than the beginning,

05:56.094 --> 05:59.010

06:25.080 --> 06:26.429

06:54.544 --> 06:56.677
I got myself
into some serious trouble

06:56.720 --> 06:58.766
with the nuns one day.

06:58.809 --> 07:03.684
You see, they said that
only God could create life...

07:03.727 --> 07:06.426
and I said, "That's not true.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.515
"My dad creates life.

07:08.558 --> 07:11.039
He's gotten hundreds
of women pregnant."

07:14.782 --> 07:16.653
As I got older,
my understanding

07:16.697 --> 07:20.788
of my father's work got
a little more sophisticated,

07:20.831 --> 07:23.660
but one thing never changed:

07:23.704 --> 07:27.838
I'm still that little girl
that thinks he's a god.

07:27.882 --> 07:31.102
Because I've seen him
make miracles happen,

07:31.146 --> 07:33.148
make families.

07:33.191 --> 07:36.891
And I'm so honored
to introduce him to you.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.763

07:39.807 --> 07:42.592

all the time,

he wouldn't exist.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.915

their genetic material

at the Bechley clinic.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.928

-My source says that you used

a patient at your practice.

it wasn't your favorite,

09:52.766 --> 09:54.158
but they did pay,

09:54.202 --> 09:55.638
and the phone
hasn't been exactly

09:55.682 --> 09:56.987
ringing off the hook lately.

09:57.031 --> 09:59.381
Yeah, whose fault is that?

09:59.424 --> 10:01.644
We want to get you some help.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.037
We found a clinic.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.952
RON: Real nice place.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.520
Everything that I take
is prescribed by doctors.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.218
-Well--
-Okay? Shut up.

10:10.261 --> 10:12.176
Just because I get angry
when people mess with me,

10:12.220 --> 10:13.917
that doesn't make me
a drug addict.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.093
RON: There's upset, and there's
breaking someone's clavicle.

10:16.137 --> 10:17.617
-Wait, shut up!
-RON: I--

10:17.660 --> 10:19.357
For patients
of the Bechley clinic,

10:19.401 --> 10:21.925
the whole story
of how they came to be

10:21.969 --> 10:23.448
could turn out to be a lie.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.799
Bechley? That's the clinic
you guys used.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.104
If you may have been affected,
please reach out

10:27.148 --> 10:29.367
with the hashtag
BechleyBabies.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.674
We want to hear your story.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.502
ISAAC: They want to know
what's happening.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.417
-They deserve to know.
-MICHAEL: When the doctor

10:35.460 --> 10:37.506
stabilizes, we'll investigate.
Until then--

10:37.549 --> 10:39.551
ISAAC: This thing is already
blowing up, okay,

10:39.595 --> 10:41.553
on TV, social media.
There's a hashtag--

10:41.597 --> 10:43.860
Bechley Babies.
And not that this is about me,

10:43.904 --> 10:46.863
but this is my career too,
okay, my livelihood.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.952
JULIA: You guys,
do you mind, uh,

10:48.996 --> 10:51.215
going away?

10:51.259 --> 10:54.088
Yeah, but, uh...

10:54.131 --> 10:56.481
you sure you don't
wanna take a break?

10:56.525 --> 10:58.092
No.

10:58.135 --> 10:59.571
Okay.
He's gonna be fine, Julia.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.399
Okay?
They got to the artery fast.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.097
-Placed the stent.
-I know.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.403
Isaac, I know.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.318
Can you please just go
and take him with you?

11:07.362 --> 11:09.581
Of course. He is gonna
be okay, though, Julia.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.409
I know.

11:13.585 --> 11:14.978
LEON: Jules.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.893
Hey.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.199
Hey.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.680
There you are.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.159
Hi.

11:23.770 --> 11:27.077
If I'm not gonna make it,
I want you to know--

11:27.121 --> 11:28.644
You're gonna be fine.

11:30.124 --> 11:31.560
You have to be.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.258
You're all I got.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.218
You're still the one.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.744
The most special one.

11:43.615 --> 11:44.921
No matter what.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.373
Hey, Ma!

12:02.417 --> 12:05.202
Oh, you got even more records.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.900
Looks nice.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.597
Um, I've--I've been
calling you and texting you.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.773
Sorry, honey.
You know how bad I am at that.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.122
What's that smell?

12:12.166 --> 12:14.298
-It's giving me a headache.
-Sage.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.213
My landlord was here.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.911
I don't know how long
I can hold on to the place.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.739
-Can you write him a letter?
-I can't, I'm sorry.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.871
I can't get involved
in your disputes anymore.

12:21.915 --> 12:26.180
Mom, I was calling
about these allegations

12:26.223 --> 12:27.616
against the Bechley clinic.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.096
Oh.

12:29.139 --> 12:31.707
Leon.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.317
All right.

12:33.361 --> 12:35.363
I mean, they're obviously
extremely troubling.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.974
Wait, did you know?

12:38.018 --> 12:41.630
Well, I didn't know.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.980
You told me my dad
was a number in a book.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.765
I suspected.

12:45.808 --> 12:48.506
Over the years,
these qualities emerged in you

12:48.550 --> 12:50.813
that looked so familiar.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.076
That cloak of ambition
you throw over yourself,

12:53.120 --> 12:54.512
hiding who you really are--

12:54.556 --> 12:57.037
-classic Leon.
-Leon Bechley.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.299
Julia's father.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.779
I grew up with them.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.432
We had Thanksgiving dinner
with them.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.260
Yeah, I could never get it
together for the holidays.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.046
He is the most pompous,
controlling--

13:06.089 --> 13:07.525
Oh, don't even.

13:07.569 --> 13:10.093
Sweetheart, look at me.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.355
I'm your mother.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.010
I carried you.
I cared for you.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.359
That's what matters,

13:15.403 --> 13:17.535
not whatever ended up
in some test tube.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.450
It is so like you
to dismiss this.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.713
I am trying to tell you
that I love you.

13:21.757 --> 13:24.760
It's always been so hard
for you to take in love.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.197
-You're broken in that way.
-Broken.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.851
Oh, so now I'm broken?

13:28.895 --> 13:30.374
Honey, we're all broken.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.986
You're so eager
to seem perfect.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.422
The way you stay
in that marriage

13:34.465 --> 13:35.727
even though
it's such a strain.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.034
My marriage is none
of your business.

13:38.078 --> 13:39.209
I should have known.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.385
This was a mistake.

13:44.562 --> 13:45.563
JULIA:
You're the one who wanted

13:45.607 --> 13:46.913
to reach out to our patients.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.262
ISAAC: Yeah, I meant
a phone call,

13:48.305 --> 13:50.438
a sympathetic email,
not this.

13:50.481 --> 13:51.831
JULIA:
For God's sakes.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.006
Miss Bechley!

13:53.049 --> 13:54.572
According to your
Facebook page,

13:54.616 --> 13:56.444
you've invited former patients
into the clinic. Why?

13:56.487 --> 13:58.054
We are offering
to anyone who's concerned

13:58.098 --> 14:00.883
the chance to come in for
a free, confidential DNA kit

14:00.927 --> 14:02.885
to put this whole thing to rest
so we can go back

14:02.929 --> 14:04.539
to doing the great work
that we're known so well for.

14:04.582 --> 14:06.019
Thank you so much.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.890
CLERK: After you put your...

14:07.934 --> 14:09.457
ISAAC: You sounded
pretty confident out there.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.893
JULIA: I know my dad.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.155
He would never
do something like this,

14:12.199 --> 14:13.330
and these tests will prove it.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.636
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.856
-What is she doing here?
-ISAAC: Who?

14:16.899 --> 14:18.031
JULIA: Edie Palmer.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.249
Bet she came here to sue us.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.773
Maybe she just came
to gloat.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.907
-Gloat? About what?
-About winning.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.039
CLERK: And by the way,
it's illegal.

14:26.082 --> 14:27.475
JULIA: Edie.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.085
Look, if you came here
to sue us--

14:29.129 --> 14:30.478
I don't sue people.

14:30.521 --> 14:31.958
I am a criminal defense
attorney.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.785
It is a completely
different field, actually.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.222
I get it.
You're smarter than me.

14:35.265 --> 14:36.397
TIM: Julia.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.139
It's nice to see you again.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.270
How are you doing?

14:40.314 --> 14:41.315
Well, you know,
it's been

14:41.358 --> 14:42.751
a little bit
of a rough week.

14:42.794 --> 14:43.926
Dad almost died,
and now we're in the middle

14:43.970 --> 14:45.319
of a genetic witch hunt.

14:45.362 --> 14:46.276
So if you're not here
as someone's lawyer,

14:46.320 --> 14:47.625
then why are you here?

14:47.669 --> 14:49.366
Well, my mom was friends
with your mom...

14:49.410 --> 14:51.412
I know, that's why
we always had to hang out.

14:51.455 --> 14:54.328
And she was a patient
of your father's.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.330
Great.
First you steal my boyfriend.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.680
Now why not try
to steal my father too?

14:59.463 --> 15:00.682
TIM: Julia--

15:00.725 --> 15:02.118
ROXY: Okay, so I'm now entering

15:02.162 --> 15:03.467
the Bechley clinic space.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.078
Having all the feels,
you know?

15:05.121 --> 15:06.818
I'm nervous.
I'm excited.

15:06.862 --> 15:10.300
Let's find out if I share
a special bond with a stranger.

15:10.344 --> 15:12.259
Excuse me?
Excuse me.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.870
You can't film in here.
You have to turn that off.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.828
Okay, well, I think I have
a right to express myself.

15:16.872 --> 15:18.787
It's called freedom of speech.
Google it.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.877
I don't need to Google it.
I studied it in law school.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.053
The First Amendment
has no bearing in this context,

15:24.097 --> 15:26.186
where patients have
a reasonable expectation

15:26.229 --> 15:27.535
of privacy.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.666
Well, you have
a reasonable expectation

15:28.710 --> 15:30.538
of getting this stick
up your ass.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.582
EDIE: Oh, you think the rules
don't apply to you?

15:31.626 --> 15:33.323
Yeah.
Listen, do you want to go?

15:33.367 --> 15:34.803
-Because I will go right now.
-EDIE: Yeah, we can go.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.326
-We can go to court--
-JULIA: Hey, hey!

15:36.370 --> 15:38.502
Nobody is going to go, okay?

15:38.546 --> 15:39.851
Besides, she already has

15:39.895 --> 15:41.157
a pretty sizable stick
up her ass.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.158
-Excuse me!

15:42.202 --> 15:43.420
But you cannot film in here.

15:43.464 --> 15:44.682
It's disrespectful
to the patients and--

15:44.726 --> 15:48.425
Hey, uh, Julia actually does
the same exact

15:48.469 --> 15:49.687
-tooth-tapping thing.
-No, I don't.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.689
ISAAC: Uh, believe me,
you do.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.996
So does Edie
when she's nervous.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.693
I do not tap my teeth.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.086
You're probably not aware
of it, but--

15:57.130 --> 15:59.001
Wait, maybe it's, like,
a shared genetic trait,

15:59.045 --> 16:01.569
like, uh--like rolling
your tongue into a cigar shape,

16:01.612 --> 16:03.527
which, according to WebMD,
is, like, totally inherited.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.181
I can do it.
Can you do it?

16:05.225 --> 16:07.096
Here, try.

16:13.189 --> 16:16.366
Okay, I don't know about you,
but I think that's pretty cool.

16:16.410 --> 16:18.629
Hey, um, do you want
to get a sister selfie

16:18.673 --> 16:20.718
for social meeds?

16:20.762 --> 16:22.633
Excuse me, sir, can you move?

16:22.677 --> 16:24.374
-You're in the shot.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.462
-Nope.
-No way.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.165
How many did we get today?

16:32.208 --> 16:34.297
Uh, 15 in person,

16:34.341 --> 16:37.039
and another 19 asked for tests

16:37.083 --> 16:39.172
-to be sent out to them.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.354
Good news?

16:47.397 --> 16:49.660
Just this hot guy I met up with
the other night.

16:49.704 --> 16:52.272
My dating app says
that he's nearby.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.665
He's really nearby.
He couldn't be more nearby.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.102
Oh, no, wait.
This isn't right.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.234
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he's here.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.367
Oh, God.

17:00.410 --> 17:01.716
Sam!

17:01.759 --> 17:03.544
-Hey.
-Oh, hey. Um...

17:03.587 --> 17:05.459
Hi.
What are you doing here?

17:05.502 --> 17:08.288
Oh, this is my wife, Kim.

17:09.419 --> 17:10.594
Your wife.

17:10.638 --> 17:11.813
That is great.
Hi.

17:11.856 --> 17:13.249
-Hi.
-Julia.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.468
How do you know each other?

17:14.511 --> 17:16.557
Oh, um, AA meetings.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.733
Yes, AA meetings.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.736
'Cause we are both addicts.

17:21.779 --> 17:24.521
So were your parents
at the clinic?

17:24.565 --> 17:26.828
No, Sam's.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.177
It's a crazy story.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.700
He didn't know
he was an IVF baby.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.354
His mom never told him.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.747
Shame or stigma, I guess.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.575
Yeah, so she saw the report
on TV.

17:34.618 --> 17:35.967
She told me about it,
and I'm like,

17:36.011 --> 17:37.665
"I look nothing like my dad."

17:37.708 --> 17:39.319
He's, like, a foot shorter
than I am.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.321
But when I saw pictures
of Dr. Bechley, I was like,

17:41.364 --> 17:42.800
"Yeah, that makes sense."

17:42.844 --> 17:44.759
-Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
-SAM: Mm-hmm.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.282
-Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.
-SAM: Mm-hmm.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.632
So, Julia, you work here
at the Bechley Institute?

17:48.676 --> 17:51.157
Yes, I do.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.768
And I'm also a Bechley.

17:53.811 --> 17:56.901
Leon Bechley is my, um--
he's, uh...

17:56.945 --> 17:58.903
-Your...
-He's, uh, my dad.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.383
He's my dad.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.690
So that means you two might be
brother and sister?

18:03.604 --> 18:04.866
Maybe.

18:07.303 --> 18:10.176

Dad, when you came out
of surgery, you said something

about me being the only one
who was special.

20:18.782 --> 20:21.176

honey, I was sedated.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.623
It was an ex-patient
with an agenda.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.017
I gave out DNA kits.

20:37.975 --> 20:40.369
-Why?
-People wanted answers.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.066
I--I wanted answers.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.720
Anyway, it's done.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.244
The results will be back soon,

20:45.287 --> 20:48.421
so I'm gonna ask you
one more time:

20:48.464 --> 20:51.424
is there anything
that you need to tell me?

20:58.257 --> 21:00.084
You have to let me explain.

21:02.478 --> 21:05.742
I asked you to lunch
when I started this gig.

21:05.786 --> 21:08.310
It was six months ago?

21:08.354 --> 21:09.877
Took you a minute to respond.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.706
I have been so crazed.
I'm sorry about that.

21:12.749 --> 21:14.490
You'll have to let me
get the salads.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.971
Okay.

21:17.014 --> 21:19.234
I don't really do salads.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.540
So I see.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.716
Actually, I was a vegetarian
for a few years.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.326
Ethical reasons.
Thank you.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.023
EDIE: Oh,
and then what happened?

21:26.067 --> 21:28.461
Decided ethics were overrated?

21:28.504 --> 21:30.332
No.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.160
I just got hungry,

21:32.203 --> 21:34.771
and salads just weren't
doing it for me anymore.

21:48.176 --> 21:50.134
Your firm involved
in the Bechley case at all?

21:50.178 --> 21:52.920
I mean, not to my knowledge,
but, uh--why?

21:52.963 --> 21:54.922
Is your office pursuing
something criminal?

21:54.965 --> 21:56.184
Well, we're getting
pressured to.

21:56.227 --> 21:57.664
Looks like this guy
perpetrated

21:57.707 --> 21:59.753

21:59.796 --> 22:02.059

22:28.695 --> 22:31.350

22:33.526 --> 22:37.312
Well, you know, we--
we act like professionals...

22:37.356 --> 22:39.532

-Okay.

um, it's fine.

I just--this...

22:52.501 --> 22:54.895
I should have got the burger.
Is it good?

22:56.679 --> 23:00.422
You have to remember,
when I was starting out,

23:00.466 --> 23:02.903
infertility was
a dead-end street.

23:02.946 --> 23:04.165
I changed all that.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.863
I became the miracle worker,

23:06.907 --> 23:09.431
the last resort
for desperate patients.

23:09.475 --> 23:13.566
So when there were
insurmountable challenges--

23:13.609 --> 23:17.091
when people who put all
their hopes and dreams on me

23:17.134 --> 23:20.399
had to be told
that it might not happen...

23:25.926 --> 23:28.276
I stacked the deck.

23:28.319 --> 23:31.410
I used material
that I knew to be successful--

23:31.453 --> 23:33.281
Your material...

23:33.324 --> 23:35.892
without bothering
to ask for permission.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.111
They--they left
with their miracles.

23:37.154 --> 23:38.242
They all had positive
outcomes.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.854
No, not outcomes,
babies!

23:40.897 --> 23:42.551
They would turn into people,

23:42.595 --> 23:44.727
people who would grow up...

23:44.771 --> 23:46.555
not knowing who they are
or where they came from.

23:46.599 --> 23:48.644
Okay, genetics are
just one determinant

23:48.688 --> 23:51.038
in the complex makeup
of a human being.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.474
I hooked up
with my own brother!

23:52.518 --> 23:53.823
Yeah.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.738
A guy I went out with

23:55.782 --> 23:58.567
could be one of your babies.

23:58.611 --> 24:01.614
Did you ever think about that
as an outcome?

24:01.657 --> 24:04.965
Interbreeding did occur to me,
but I counted on

24:05.008 --> 24:06.488
low statistical probability.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.273
I just told you something
life-changingly disgusting

24:09.317 --> 24:11.406
that happened to me,
your daughter,

24:11.450 --> 24:13.016
and you're talking
about probability?

24:13.060 --> 24:14.627
Look, I--I am just--
You're right.

24:14.670 --> 24:18.282
-I'm just trying to explain--
-How many, Dad?

24:18.326 --> 24:20.023
Uh, can I get some water?

24:27.161 --> 24:29.250
How many?

24:30.381 --> 24:32.949
I never kept a formal record.

24:34.951 --> 24:35.996
Dozens?

24:39.521 --> 24:41.088

25:06.026 --> 25:07.114

28:20.437 --> 28:21.874
Yeah, listen--listen to me,

28:28.750 --> 28:29.838
Some information I recorded,

28:29.882 --> 28:31.579
some data--

28:31.622 --> 28:33.233
uh, if they see it,
they might get the wrong idea.

28:33.276 --> 28:35.365
That's illegal.

28:35.409 --> 28:36.540
I could go to jail.

28:36.584 --> 28:38.542
No one is gonna go to jail.

28:38.586 --> 28:41.154
It's gonna be a big news story
for a week or two,

28:41.197 --> 28:43.504
and then everyone
will move on.

28:43.547 --> 28:45.680
-No, I don't want to help.
-Jules, please.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.248
Y-you can do this one thing
for your old man.

28:48.291 --> 28:49.553
This one thing?

28:49.597 --> 28:52.774
I have done everything for you.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.516
My whole adult life
has been about you.

28:55.559 --> 28:58.258
I gave up going to med school.
I gave up so much.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.086
So don't you dare
call it "one thing."

29:03.959 --> 29:08.790
You could be
a phenomenal doctor.

29:08.834 --> 29:12.098
You're as smart as I am.
You're twice as caring.

29:12.141 --> 29:15.101
But if they take me down,
it'll destroy you too.

29:15.144 --> 29:16.842
They'll never license you.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.497
Your future will be over

29:20.541 --> 29:23.457
before it even has a chance
to begin.

29:28.462 --> 29:30.943
The computer's in my study,

29:30.986 --> 29:32.814
on my desk.

29:32.858 --> 29:35.861
I'm not a good person...

29:35.904 --> 29:37.819
but you are.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.952
I know you won't let me down.

29:53.269 --> 29:54.793
Sorry.

29:54.836 --> 29:57.796
You just surprised me.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.754
I didn't mean to.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.060
I was just hoping to talk,

30:01.103 --> 30:02.583
but you've been on that
all night.

30:02.626 --> 30:04.759
Oh, I--I have so much work
to catch up on.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.892
-I had a lunch today, and--
-I know.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.764
-With who?
-Um, an old client.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.332
I was just hoping
that we could talk more

30:12.375 --> 30:13.986
about the Bechley case.

30:14.029 --> 30:16.292
I think it might be a good idea
for us to take it.

30:16.336 --> 30:19.208
We've been busting our asses
to get on the partner track.

30:19.252 --> 30:21.907
A case this high-profile
would get us there.

30:25.867 --> 30:28.827
This is about her, isn't it?
Julia.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.480
This is your chance
to be her hero.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.700
Okay, that's nuts.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.876
Is it?

30:34.920 --> 30:37.705
-You loved her.
-We were kids.

30:37.748 --> 30:40.926
That was--she was
my college sweetheart.

30:40.969 --> 30:42.841
You're my whole life.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.625
-Can you just--
-Don't.

30:47.497 --> 30:49.891
How many more times
are you gonna say that to me?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.764
I just don't feel like
being touched right now.

30:55.201 --> 30:56.767
Am I supposed
to pretend like I do?

30:56.811 --> 30:59.031
No, no, of course not.

30:59.074 --> 31:01.685
But you make me feel like
I'm the enemy sometimes.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.905
But I'm on your team, okay?

31:03.949 --> 31:06.429
-We're on the same team.
-What are you talking about?

31:06.473 --> 31:07.909
-What team?
-God.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.476
What team do you think I'm on?

31:09.519 --> 31:11.130
I can't keep doing this.

31:11.173 --> 31:12.566
Like, it shouldn't be
this hard.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.089
It shouldn't.

31:14.133 --> 31:16.091
You know what?
I'm--I'm sorry.

31:16.135 --> 31:17.919
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

31:19.399 --> 31:20.791
I'm sorry you picked
such a broken person

31:20.835 --> 31:22.968
to be married to.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.013
I never said that.

31:25.057 --> 31:27.711
Babe, come here.
What are you doing?

31:27.755 --> 31:28.930
You leaving?

31:28.974 --> 31:30.845
I am trying here.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.152
-What else do you want from me?
-Nothing.

31:33.195 --> 31:34.936
I--I don't want anything
from you.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.330
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

31:37.373 --> 31:38.809
Edie, don't walk away!

31:38.853 --> 31:40.202
We're in the middle
of something here!

31:40.246 --> 31:41.247
Edie!

31:56.175 --> 31:57.480
Tim.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.700
Hello.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.484
Wish I would have known
you were coming.

32:01.528 --> 32:04.966
I would have done something.

32:05.010 --> 32:07.403
Um, I know, it--
it's a mess in here.

32:07.447 --> 32:10.015
I'm--I'm a mess.

32:11.364 --> 32:13.279
I actually just came by
to tell you

32:13.322 --> 32:15.977
that we will not be able
to take your father's case.

32:16.021 --> 32:18.240
Edie made that pretty clear.

32:18.284 --> 32:21.591
I guess I just wanted you
to know that I tried.

32:21.635 --> 32:23.724
I didn't just give up.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.944
Okay.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.250
I know you can't help,

32:28.294 --> 32:32.385
but can you still keep
lawyer secrets?

32:32.428 --> 32:33.777
Yes.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.562
Attorney-client privilege
still applies.

32:38.043 --> 32:41.611
So it looks like my dad
kept a kind of record

32:41.655 --> 32:44.614
of what he did and who he...

32:44.658 --> 32:46.486
made.

32:46.529 --> 32:48.183
This is your father's laptop?

32:49.010 --> 32:50.794
He tracked them,

32:50.838 --> 32:52.927
all these years.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.060
So if the authorities
see all this...

32:55.103 --> 32:57.410
Honestly, it shows intent.

32:57.453 --> 32:58.672
They could charge him

32:58.715 --> 33:00.369
with criminal fraud,
at least.

33:04.678 --> 33:06.027
If they find it.

33:09.204 --> 33:11.815
Destroying evidence
is a serious crime.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.688
Did he--
Wait, you know what?

33:14.731 --> 33:16.298
I don't even want to know.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.997
But if he did...

33:19.040 --> 33:21.651
why would you put yourself
at risk for him like that?

33:21.695 --> 33:23.784
Because I love him.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.481
He's my dad.

33:25.525 --> 33:27.048
Yeah, I know what you're
willing to give up for him.

33:27.092 --> 33:28.963
I didn't just give up.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.791
After my mom, he needed me.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.532
I was all that he had.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.664
Maybe you think that
I'm being a doormat, but--

33:34.708 --> 33:36.014
No.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.537
I think you're wonderful

33:37.580 --> 33:40.322
and that he's lucky
to have you in his life.

33:40.366 --> 33:43.369
I just think
that you deserve better.

33:49.897 --> 33:52.073
-I should probably--
-Yeah.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.596
Probably should.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.567
I know this kind of
goes without saying,

34:07.610 --> 34:10.570
but it still really sucks
that you're not here.

34:10.613 --> 34:12.050
What did you say, dear?

34:12.093 --> 34:14.052
Oh, I'm not talking to you.

34:14.095 --> 34:16.184
-I'm talking to my dead mom.
-Oh.

34:16.228 --> 34:19.100
You know what?
Just keep walking.

34:20.580 --> 34:23.148
JULIA: You'd probably do
exactly what he asked.

34:23.191 --> 34:25.063
You would just take care of it,

34:25.106 --> 34:27.195
protect him...

34:27.239 --> 34:29.415
just this one more time.

34:31.939 --> 34:35.029
But I can't do it anymore.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.726
Not again.

34:38.946 --> 34:40.904
Not even for you.

39:01.382 --> 39:02.601

39:04.690 --> 39:06.039
It's right down the hall.

39:06.082 --> 39:07.606
Knock yourself out.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.133
Whoa.

39:30.759 --> 39:32.892
Can I come in?

39:32.935 --> 39:34.807
Uh, I guess.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.898
Do you need something?

39:39.725 --> 39:41.596
My mom used to wake me up
in the middle of the night

39:41.640 --> 39:42.858
when I was a little kid,

39:42.902 --> 39:44.556
and she would take me
on these walks.

39:44.599 --> 39:46.035
And the next day,
I'd fall asleep in class,

39:46.079 --> 39:47.559
and everyone would
make fun of me.

39:47.602 --> 39:48.777
It was hard enough
being the half-black girl

39:48.821 --> 39:50.170
whose mom knitted her ponchos

39:50.213 --> 39:52.215
instead of buying her
a winter coat.

39:52.259 --> 39:55.523
Well, why are you
telling me this right now?

39:55.567 --> 39:57.307
Because I was always jealous
of you.

39:57.351 --> 39:58.744
You had this family,

39:58.787 --> 40:01.137
a dad who would
come home from work

40:01.181 --> 40:03.270
and sit down with you
at the dinner table--

40:03.313 --> 40:05.490
with dinner on it.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.317
I've spent my whole life
looking for that,

40:07.361 --> 40:10.146
that thing that you got
to take for granted:

40:10.190 --> 40:12.322
stability.

40:12.366 --> 40:15.282
And you got that with Tim.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.458
I did. I did.

40:17.502 --> 40:18.764
I thought I did.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.508
But it's like there's this...

40:23.551 --> 40:25.335
little thread,

40:25.379 --> 40:27.555
this dangling little thing,

40:27.599 --> 40:30.079
and it got pulled, and...

40:31.124 --> 40:33.605
Now I'm afraid
it's all coming apart.

40:37.826 --> 40:39.088
Is someone here?

40:39.132 --> 40:40.829
Oh.

40:40.873 --> 40:43.092
-Yeah, uh--
-ROXY: Hey, Julesy?

40:44.529 --> 40:45.660
ROXY: Do you have
any bath products

40:45.704 --> 40:47.357
without coconut oil?

40:47.401 --> 40:49.838
I wouldn't mind not smelling
like a piña colada.

40:49.882 --> 40:51.840
What are you doing here?

40:51.884 --> 40:53.320
What are youdoing here?

40:53.363 --> 40:55.757
I'm sorry.

40:55.801 --> 40:57.542
-I'll go.
-No, no, no.

40:57.585 --> 40:59.761
It's okay.

40:59.805 --> 41:02.198
This whole thing has been...

41:02.982 --> 41:05.811
You're not the only one
whose life got pulled apart.

41:05.854 --> 41:09.728
So if you need to hang out
or even stay for a bit...

41:09.771 --> 41:11.686
That would be...

41:13.340 --> 41:14.733
Thank you.

41:14.776 --> 41:16.778
Yeah, I already called
the guest room,

41:16.822 --> 41:19.172
so you're on the couch,
Counselor.

41:20.521 --> 41:21.914
Thanks.

41:21.957 --> 41:25.395
SINGERS: ♪ Home is where
the heart is ♪

41:25.439 --> 41:29.182

41:29.225 --> 41:31.271
Morning.

41:31.314 --> 41:33.055
Found your coffee.

41:33.099 --> 41:35.144
Although I couldn't find
a clean mug.

41:35.188 --> 41:36.537
They're in here.

41:36.581 --> 41:38.496
Oh, you call these clean.

41:38.539 --> 41:40.280
-What do you take in yours?
-ROXY: Nothing, just black.

41:40.323 --> 41:42.282
JULIA: Same.
Can't do the lactose.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.937
-Me either.
-Check us out.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.982
Sharing lactose intolerance.

41:47.026 --> 41:48.854
What are the odds
of that, huh?

41:49.594 --> 41:51.291
Fairly high, actually.

41:51.334 --> 41:53.554
Roughly 1/4
of the adult population.

41:53.598 --> 41:54.947
Still gonna Google it.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.426
You know, it is possible
to know things

41:56.470 --> 41:58.864
without Googling them.

41:58.907 --> 42:00.692
Hey, have you guys checked
your email?

42:00.735 --> 42:02.868
I have a message
from the DNA testing company.

42:02.911 --> 42:04.565
It's my results.

42:04.609 --> 42:07.350
It says I'm a 99.3% match

42:07.394 --> 42:10.179
for paternity
with Leon Bechley.

42:10.789 --> 42:13.574
And I'm a 99.6% match
with him.

42:15.228 --> 42:16.664
Always gotta be
a little bit higher,

42:16.708 --> 42:18.927
don't you, Edie?

42:18.971 --> 42:21.974
Well, I guess that's...

42:22.017 --> 42:23.410
that's it.
We're...

42:24.585 --> 42:26.456
Genetically connected.

42:27.414 --> 42:28.676
Family.

42:30.896 --> 42:32.637
Hey, how many others
do you think there are?

42:32.680 --> 42:34.377
Dozens.

42:35.814 --> 42:36.902
More.

42:38.730 --> 42:40.514
-We don't know yet.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.647
ROXY: Okay, but we're gonna
find out, right?

42:44.300 --> 42:46.651
I can't believe
it's not just me anymore.

42:48.087 --> 42:51.394
I mean, I--I have sisters.

42:53.266 --> 42:56.225
-I guess this means--
-I can finally tell you.

42:57.662 --> 42:59.925
You have a chin hair
right here.

42:59.968 --> 43:01.666
-What?
-It's really long.

43:01.709 --> 43:03.102
Yeah, do you see it
right there?

43:03.145 --> 43:05.321
-I see it.
-Guys, that's so embarrassing!

43:05.365 --> 43:07.846
-EDIE: yeah, oof.

43:07.889 --> 43:09.412
It's Isaac.

43:09.456 --> 43:11.763
Hey, um, is that the cute
doctor from the clinic?

43:11.806 --> 43:13.721
Ew, he's like my brother.

43:13.765 --> 43:15.288
Which is a very sore subject.

43:15.331 --> 43:17.420
-Hello.
-ISAAC: Julia?

43:17.464 --> 43:19.727
I'm actually at the hospital
with your dad right now,

43:19.771 --> 43:21.903
and you need to get down here.

43:22.904 --> 43:24.253
All right, guys,

43:24.297 --> 43:25.472
you're all gonna get
your picture,

43:25.515 --> 43:26.560
but I need you to back up.

43:26.604 --> 43:27.735
Let's keep this area clear.

43:27.779 --> 43:28.954
I'm not gonna say it again.

43:28.997 --> 43:30.912
Balter!
Hey, what's going on?

43:30.956 --> 43:33.828
We're serving an arrest warrant
for that doctor.

43:33.872 --> 43:36.091
Perp walking
out of a hospital?

43:36.135 --> 43:37.571
That's a pretty aggressive move
for a fraud case,

43:37.615 --> 43:38.703
don't you think?

43:38.746 --> 43:41.619
It's not a fraud case anymore.

43:44.709 --> 43:47.712
Our office has determined
that Dr. Bechley's misuse

43:47.755 --> 43:50.758
of his genetic material
without his patients' consent

43:50.802 --> 43:53.413
rises to the level
of sexual assault.

43:57.112 --> 43:59.158
And we intend
to prosecute it as such.
