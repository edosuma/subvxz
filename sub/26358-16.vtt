WEBVTT

00:07.311 --> 00:09.835
Think he's gonna show?MAN: Be patient.

00:09.879 --> 00:12.969
She said he comes out at 8:00
like clockwork.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.232
Am I shooting or you?

00:15.276 --> 00:16.799
No, you lost your shooting
privileges after that INDO

00:16.842 --> 00:20.107
in Van Nuys.So, what, I make one little
mistake and that's it?

00:20.150 --> 00:22.022
This one's too important
for another little mistake.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.501
Well, if he don't show soon,
I'm gonna burn down

00:23.545 --> 00:24.633
this whole hillside.

00:24.676 --> 00:25.808
It's "burn up," not "down."

00:25.851 --> 00:27.723
What?Sure, it's a
nuance, but no,

00:27.766 --> 00:29.333
you're gonna light the
place on fire, are you?

00:29.377 --> 00:31.161
Now I got to deal
with semantics, too?

00:31.205 --> 00:32.902
Shh, shh, here he comes.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.819
Oh, look
at that plumage.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.821
I told you
he'd be worth it.

00:38.864 --> 00:41.519
This is me
eating my words.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.132
The hell was that?

01:02.279 --> 01:03.324
WOMAN :
Find the candy.

01:03.367 --> 01:04.325
Are you all right?

01:04.368 --> 01:07.371
Find the candy.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.116
Call 911!

01:13.160 --> 01:15.118
Don't move.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.359
Bill, bill, bill.

01:38.402 --> 01:39.621
Oh, look at this!

01:39.664 --> 01:41.623
Another late
wedding RSVP.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.929
Oh, just barely three months
past the deadline.

01:43.973 --> 01:44.930
Yours or mine?

01:44.974 --> 01:45.931
Survey says...

01:45.975 --> 01:47.890
Cousin Mortimer,

01:47.933 --> 01:49.544
House Blye.

01:49.587 --> 01:51.372
How well do you know this
guy? Can we just pretend

01:51.415 --> 01:53.243
we didn't get it?It is not a problem,

01:53.287 --> 01:55.115
because my Great Uncle Oliver
canceled, so I will just put

01:55.158 --> 01:56.638
Mortimer right in there.That's not the point.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.857
These things just... they
keep showing up like this.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.381
And they're late.
And-and the to-do list

02:00.424 --> 02:02.034
just keeps
getting longer.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.949
And I-I... And the time
just keeps ticking and tockingHoney.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.516
and ticking and tocking and
we haven't even begun to start.Okay. Deeks.

02:05.560 --> 02:06.996
There's 13 things

02:07.039 --> 02:08.432
we haven't even...
What? What?Deeks. Deeks, stop.

02:08.476 --> 02:09.955
Inhale, exhale.

02:11.000 --> 02:11.957
Now say it with me.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.176
It's gonna be okay.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.135
It's going to be...

02:15.178 --> 02:17.789
okay.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.182
Wow.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.793
It's amazing
how you do that for me.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.578
That's why you're marrying me.That's why I'm
marrying you.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.841
Wedding emergency!
Oh, my God!

02:25.884 --> 02:28.452
I just got my dress back
from the tailor,

02:28.496 --> 02:31.586
who I told to take one inch
off the bottom,

02:31.629 --> 02:33.065
and he definitely took more.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.590
And now I'm worried that
it's borderline inappropriate.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.983
What do you think?I'm guessing it's totally...

02:38.593 --> 02:40.421
Can't unsee that.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.770
ROBERTA: I knew it.Ah!
You said "inch."

02:41.813 --> 02:42.771
Looks more like a foot.

02:42.814 --> 02:43.772
ROBERTA:
I knew it.

02:43.815 --> 02:44.903
Now, do I dare take it back

02:44.947 --> 02:46.340
and trust him to do it right

02:46.383 --> 02:48.298
or do I just scrap the whole
thing and buy a new one?

02:48.342 --> 02:50.213
I don't have time
to hem it myself, which is what

02:50.257 --> 02:52.389
I should have done
in the first place.Do you see where I get it?

02:52.433 --> 02:53.608
It's okay.It's not okay.

02:53.651 --> 02:54.826
She's freaking out.ROBERTA: How's the rest

02:54.870 --> 02:55.610
of the party's tailoring?
And what about

02:55.653 --> 02:56.611
the speeches?

02:56.654 --> 02:57.655
Not great.Do not let

02:57.699 --> 02:59.135
Uncle Bob grab the mic.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.224
Shouldn't you be studying
for the health inspection?

03:01.268 --> 03:03.574
'Cause they're gonna be asking
us all sorts of questions.Who needs to study?

03:03.618 --> 03:06.751
I've seen every episode
of Kitchen Nightmares.Twice.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.318
Twice.You're watching a show?

03:08.362 --> 03:10.407
That's not preparation.Kensi.
Yeah.

03:10.451 --> 03:11.974
Is this your to-do list?

03:12.017 --> 03:13.541
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
I got it under control.

03:13.584 --> 03:15.325
Oh, my God, honey.
It's so long.No, it's okay.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.414
DEEKS: Are you sure you don't
need me to come to work today?

03:17.458 --> 03:19.329
Because I could
come to work today.You have had this inspection

03:19.373 --> 03:20.852
scheduled for weeks.

03:20.896 --> 03:22.332
We can do without you for a day.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.073
Don't know if that's true.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.075
Speaking of which,

03:26.118 --> 03:27.424
I am needed at the boatshed.

03:27.468 --> 03:28.773
Are you sure-sure
you don't need me?

03:28.817 --> 03:30.514
#SorryNotSorry.

03:30.558 --> 03:31.689
I could come with you.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.082
Just sit in the car,
like a Labrador...

03:33.125 --> 03:34.388
Bye!

03:34.431 --> 03:36.346
...retriever.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.609
I can help you
with one of these.

03:38.653 --> 03:41.525
"Choose song
for the mother-son dance."

03:42.396 --> 03:44.224
Unnecessary.Why did you

03:44.267 --> 03:45.486
just cross that off?

03:45.529 --> 03:46.748
'Cause I don't want to do it.No, no, no.

03:46.791 --> 03:49.881
No, we are absolutely
doing a mother-son dance

03:49.925 --> 03:51.100
at my wedding.

03:51.143 --> 03:51.927
I don't think so, honey.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.321
Mama.

03:54.364 --> 03:56.236
Wha... N... Mama.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.107
Talk to the hand.Mother!

03:58.150 --> 04:00.022
Don't you walk away from me!

04:00.065 --> 04:02.067
CALLEN:
You joined a secret society

04:02.111 --> 04:03.547
of mathletes
and you're honor-bound

04:03.591 --> 04:05.723
not to reveal
their existence.Nope.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.725
You decided to go full L.A.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.945
and try that goat yoga class
that Nell told us about?

04:09.988 --> 04:11.468
No, again.
And why is it

04:11.512 --> 04:13.340
that you're so concerned
with what I did last night?

04:13.383 --> 04:15.559
Well, 'cause it's not often that
we roll into Lakers tickets,

04:15.603 --> 04:17.300
especially now that
LeBron is in town.

04:17.344 --> 04:20.085
And it is certainly not often
that you would pass on such

04:20.129 --> 04:22.610
an opportunity,
citing vague

04:22.653 --> 04:24.351
preexisting plans.

04:24.394 --> 04:27.354
No elaboration.
Just... plans.

04:27.397 --> 04:28.616
Which you conveniently
never mentioned to me before.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.618
So, yeah,

04:30.661 --> 04:32.272
color me curious.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.841
Agent DeChamps.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.235
Agent DeChamps.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.454
Sam. Callen.

04:40.497 --> 04:42.107
What brings you to town?

04:42.151 --> 04:44.458
Testified at a sentencing
hearing yesterday. Sam mentioned

04:44.501 --> 04:46.198
Deeks would be gone,
so I figured I'd stick around,

04:46.242 --> 04:48.288
lend a hand if I could.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.073
When exactly
did Sam mention that?

04:51.116 --> 04:52.596
Last night.
We met for drinks.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.858
Drinks--
really?

04:55.860 --> 04:58.036
Interesting.ERIC:
Is this

04:58.080 --> 04:59.081
a bad time?Couldn't be better,

04:59.124 --> 05:01.257
actually.Good. I think.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.998
Uh, we have a case.

05:12.268 --> 05:13.748
Don't start.I got nothing.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.924
Jazz hands.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.061
Special Prosecutor.You hide your
disappointment well.

05:24.280 --> 05:26.500
No Fatima?ERIC:
She finished

05:26.543 --> 05:28.458
the last of her paperwork
and was sent down to San Diego.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.504
NELL:
Which is a real bummer
because I wanted

05:30.547 --> 05:33.245
to take her to the Women
in Technology panel tomorrow.

05:33.289 --> 05:35.073
She hasn't been officially
stationed yet,

05:35.117 --> 05:37.946
and did say that she really
liked Los Angeles, so...

05:37.989 --> 05:39.251
Fingers crossed.ERIC: Yeah.

05:39.295 --> 05:40.818
SAM:
I thought you said
there was a case.

05:40.862 --> 05:41.950
Sorry.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.386
Okay, we have
a car accident

05:43.430 --> 05:44.996
in the Hollywood Hills.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.912
One dead.That's not our usual
jurisdiction.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.479
Well, this isn't your
usual car accident.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.655
Or at least,
it might not be.NELL: The deceased driver,

05:51.699 --> 05:54.484
Rebecca Frazier-- she was
a writer for the L.A. Ledger

05:54.528 --> 05:56.007
and she was working on a story

05:56.051 --> 05:58.575
about a classified
Marine op from last year.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.490
Good road conditions,
single vehicle--

06:00.534 --> 06:02.623
could just be a random
car accident, or...

06:02.666 --> 06:04.146
Could be something more.

06:04.189 --> 06:06.366
ROGERS:
Due to the sensitive nature
of Rebecca's story,

06:06.409 --> 06:09.064
SECNAV wants extra scrutiny
on the investigation.

06:09.107 --> 06:10.848
Hmm.
Any signs of foul play?

06:10.892 --> 06:12.589
Well, according to the two men
who found her,

06:12.633 --> 06:15.375
her last words were
"Find the candy."

06:15.418 --> 06:17.246
ERIC:
We're not exactly sure
what she meant by that,

06:17.289 --> 06:18.856
but we're looking into it.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.771
How about the classified
operation she was writing about?

06:20.815 --> 06:22.686
No, nothing on that yet, either.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.079
But I may be able to help.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.559
Emphasis on "may."

06:25.602 --> 06:28.344
Information requests
often get answered much quicker

06:28.388 --> 06:29.824
when they come from the
special prosecutor's office.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.782
NELL:
Uh, Kensi has
been briefed

06:31.826 --> 06:35.046
and she is talking to Rebecca's
editor now at the boatshed.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.308
Great. DeChamps, why
don't you join her?

06:36.352 --> 06:37.788
Sam and I will head to the site.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.404
I'm sorry, again,
for your loss.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.406
God, I still
can't believe this.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.843
I mean, I was just
having lunch with her yesterday.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.062
Did Rebecca tell
you anything

06:51.106 --> 06:52.803
about the story
she was working on?

06:53.848 --> 06:55.284
Hannah, I'm
here to help.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.286
I know it had something
to do with the military,

06:57.329 --> 06:59.897
but I promise you, all I want
to do is uncover the truth.

06:59.941 --> 07:02.509
I believe you.

07:02.552 --> 07:04.598
But I'm not so sure
I believe in the system.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.904
Just because you don't
want this story buried,

07:06.948 --> 07:09.472
that doesn't mean
it won't still happen.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.520
Did Rebecca have
any enemies?

07:13.563 --> 07:15.173
We all do.

07:15.217 --> 07:16.914
Comes with the territory.Okay,

07:16.958 --> 07:18.960
but had she received
any recent threats?

07:20.004 --> 07:21.092
One.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.486
It was mailed,
no return address.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.662
Nothing to identify the sender
other than the postage mark

07:25.706 --> 07:27.011
from Los Angeles...

07:28.578 --> 07:30.058
What?

07:30.101 --> 07:32.234
She had been trying to reach
a retired Marine

07:32.277 --> 07:34.105
named Odell Ikande.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.629
Okay.Seemed like he didn't want

07:35.672 --> 07:37.457
to speak with her.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.154
If I was gonna start anywhere,

07:39.197 --> 07:41.591
it would be there.Find the candy.

07:41.635 --> 07:43.506
Witnesses said

07:43.550 --> 07:47.510
Rebecca's last words
were "Find the candy."

07:47.554 --> 07:48.511
I think she
may have been

07:48.555 --> 07:51.471
trying to say "Find Ikande."

07:54.691 --> 07:57.955
So, you, DeChamps, drinks.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.783
Are we really not gonna
talk about this?

07:59.827 --> 08:02.177
There's nothing to talk about.
She had a rough day at court,

08:02.220 --> 08:04.832
she needed to vent,
I was happy to hear her out.

08:04.875 --> 08:06.529
Well, in some cultures, they
would consider that a date.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.313
It was absolutely
not a date.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.315
Where'd you go?

08:10.359 --> 08:12.143
I just need to have
the whole picture here.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.494
Spire 73.Spire 73.

08:14.537 --> 08:16.017
Yeah.Well, that is very upscale.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.540
And?

08:17.584 --> 08:18.846
What kind of shoes
were you wearing?

08:18.889 --> 08:20.325
What do you think,
I wore certain shoes

08:20.369 --> 08:21.544
'cause I wanted
to impress her?

08:21.588 --> 08:23.764
Well, welcome to ten years
of partnership.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.549
You're something else,
you know that?

08:26.593 --> 08:28.638
Mm-hmm.Single set of skid marks,

08:28.682 --> 08:30.118
no signs of braking.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.119
CALLEN:
Hmm, maybe they were
trying to avoid something

08:31.162 --> 08:32.642
in the road
and they lost control.

08:32.686 --> 08:33.991
Maybe.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.515
No sign they tried to correct.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.560
Mechanical failure?

08:37.604 --> 08:39.867
Opens up the
possibility of sabotage.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.000
Well, hopefully, the car

08:43.044 --> 08:45.525
can tell us more.Looks kind of muddy down there.

08:45.568 --> 08:48.049
Good thing you're not wearing
your Air Jordan 11 Space Jams.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.706
Huh? Am I right?

08:52.749 --> 08:55.317
NELL:
Sergeant Odell Ikande.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.188
He's a former
MARSOC Marine,

08:57.232 --> 08:58.842
multiple tours to Afghanistan

08:58.886 --> 09:00.583
and he received
the Purple Heart.Hmm.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.019
Looks like he was ready
to reenlist

09:02.063 --> 09:04.544
when he abruptly
withdrew his paperwork

09:04.587 --> 09:07.459
after being wounded
during a classified mission.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.592
That could be the one
Rebecca was looking into.

09:09.636 --> 09:10.854
What can you tell me
about the op?

09:10.898 --> 09:12.160
ERIC:
No more details.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.640
They've been redacted,
but we'll look into it.

09:13.683 --> 09:16.599
However, HQMC
has his last known address

09:16.643 --> 09:18.166
listed in Hancock Park.

09:18.209 --> 09:20.298
Okay. DeChamps is on her way.
We'll check it out.

09:20.342 --> 09:22.257
NELL: Sending it to you now.Thanks.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.175
All right,
thanks, Nell.

09:27.218 --> 09:29.133
We got a new
person of interest.

09:29.177 --> 09:31.266
Sergeant Odell Ikande,
former MARSOC.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.790
I'd feel a lot better about this
if we had solid evidence

09:33.834 --> 09:35.662
of foul play.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.359
You and me both.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.882
It's a lot of damage.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.884
I mean, sabotage or not, it's
gonna be tough to figure out

09:40.928 --> 09:42.930
if this was mechanical.

09:47.499 --> 09:48.805
G.

09:51.242 --> 09:53.941
Or maybe the sabotage
wasn't mechanical at all.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.465
What is that, a homemade
cell site simulator?

09:56.508 --> 09:58.946
Newer cars use cell connections
for entertainment

09:58.989 --> 10:00.643
and navigation systems.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.645
If someone used this to access
the car's computer...

10:02.689 --> 10:04.560
They could've hijacked control
of the automated steering

10:04.604 --> 10:06.518
and sent it off the road.

10:06.562 --> 10:08.651
Hackers have been warning about
these techniques for years.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.001
Ikande went through
electronic warfare training.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.047
It wouldn't be a
stretch to think

10:13.090 --> 10:14.483
that he could've made this.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.224
And if he did...

10:16.267 --> 10:18.226
We have a highly-trained Marine
on the loose,

10:18.269 --> 10:20.402
willing to kill
to cover something up.

10:38.507 --> 10:40.378
So what would you say the range
is on this thing, Eric?

10:40.422 --> 10:42.206
ERIC: It's homemade,
so it's hard to say.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.686
Maybe, mile, tops?

10:43.730 --> 10:45.862
Whoever planted it had
to be closer than that.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.559
They had to know when to
send her over the edge.

10:47.603 --> 10:48.865
Well, they could've been
following her.

10:48.909 --> 10:50.824
Well, there are limited
ways into the canyon,

10:50.867 --> 10:53.565
so it shouldn't be too difficult
to find where she entered

10:53.609 --> 10:54.784
and see if anyone
was tailing her.

10:54.828 --> 10:55.655
SAM: Yeah, well,
let us know what you find.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.395
We're on our way back.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.049
Mama, come on. How come
you won't want to do

10:59.093 --> 11:00.442
a mother-son dance
for the wedding?

11:00.485 --> 11:03.184
There's no good songs.
If you really look,

11:03.227 --> 11:06.056
all the usuals are
about romantic love.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.971
It's inappropriate and creepy.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.407
Okay, then we find
a deeper cut

11:09.451 --> 11:11.192
that's appropriate
and not creepy.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.324
How about "Mother,"
by Danzig?

11:13.368 --> 11:15.239
I'm joking. It's a joke.
How about "Forever Young"?

11:15.283 --> 11:17.328
It's about nuclear war.

11:17.372 --> 11:18.982
No, the other "Forever Young."

11:19.026 --> 11:21.071
You hate Rod Stewart.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.683
The other other other
"Forever Young" by Bob Dylan.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.423
Meh.

11:25.467 --> 11:26.947
Meh? Really?

11:26.990 --> 11:28.731
Okay, now I know
you're just being difficult,

11:28.775 --> 11:30.341
because you love Bob Dylan.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.126
I did love Bob Dylan,
before he decided

11:32.169 --> 11:34.476
he was too good
for the Nobel Prize.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.304
You know who's too good
for the Nobel Prize?

11:36.347 --> 11:38.088
Tell me.Not Einstein.

11:38.132 --> 11:41.004
Good enough for Einstein,
good enough for Dylan.

11:41.048 --> 11:42.745
Who's in charge here?That's a great question.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.355
Considering it's my wedding
we're talking about.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.096
Jeffrey Kelly,
Department of Public Health.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.272
Oh.Oh, hi.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.100
Hi. Come on in.Interesting.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.711
Interesting?

11:51.754 --> 11:53.103
This isn't over.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.760
Hey, um, Mr. Kelly,
can I get you a cup of coffee?

11:57.804 --> 12:00.284
Never touch the stuff.Really?

12:00.328 --> 12:02.199
How about a drink?Sorry.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.988
KENSI:
So your testimony was related
to the Marca investigation?

12:08.031 --> 12:11.034
DeCHAMPS:
No, before that.Oh.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.907
My last protection detail.

12:13.950 --> 12:16.866
Oh, Congressman
Guzman, right?Right.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.564
Well, you know, I've had my fair
share of time on the stand,

12:19.608 --> 12:21.523
so if you ever need
somebody to talk to.

12:21.566 --> 12:22.698
Kensi.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.352
KENSI:
Yeah, I see it.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.142
Odell Ikande?

12:32.186 --> 12:33.796
It's NCIS.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.106
Ready?Yeah.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.587
Federal agents.

12:49.159 --> 12:51.683
Clear.Clear. No signs of distress.

12:53.076 --> 12:55.078
Yeah, I got
fresh groceries here.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.522
Federal agents.
Identify yourself.

13:04.566 --> 13:05.567
I'm Ruya Ghanem.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.525
How do you know Odell Ikande?

13:07.569 --> 13:10.050
He's my roommate.

13:13.227 --> 13:14.663
ROGERS:
Major Perkins,

13:14.706 --> 13:16.273
thanks for taking the time
to talk to me.

13:16.317 --> 13:19.276
Sorry to hear Sergeant Ikande
may be mixed up in your case.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.409
He was a great Marine
dealt a tough hand.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.585
We have reason to believe
that our deceased reporter

13:23.628 --> 13:25.761
was looking into
Sergeant Ikande's final mission.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.589
Can you tell me
something about it?

13:27.632 --> 13:29.852
I'm sure you're aware
that information's classified.

13:29.896 --> 13:32.768
And I'm sure you're aware
that I have advanced clearance.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.727
Understood.

13:35.771 --> 13:37.425
But it is an ongoing operation.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.383
I'm on the same team, Major.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.472
I'm not asking you
to jeopardize your personnel,

13:41.516 --> 13:43.997
but you must be able to give me
some kind of a context.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.174
Going secure.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.872
If your reporter was interested
in Sergeant Ikande's part

13:49.916 --> 13:51.743
of the mission,
they wouldn't find much.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.136
In the broadest terms,

13:53.180 --> 13:55.747
we had intel on a high-value
target in Afghanistan.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.619
Sergeant Ikande
and his fireteam were set in,

13:57.662 --> 13:59.926
to report back
if they made a positive ID.

13:59.969 --> 14:03.799
But before they could, HQ
received an emergency phone call

14:03.843 --> 14:06.715
from civilian contractors under
attack in a nearby village.

14:06.758 --> 14:09.370
So they were pulled out
to rescue the contractors.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.198
Wasn't uncommon.
Rebels didn't want us

14:11.241 --> 14:12.852
getting too close
with the locals,

14:12.895 --> 14:15.071
target slipped away before we
could get another team on-site.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.725
Been in the wind ever since.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.292
What about the rescue?

14:18.335 --> 14:20.642
Once the objective changed,
the op was out of my hands.

14:20.685 --> 14:23.036
All I can say for certain...

14:23.079 --> 14:24.428
is that it went sideways.

14:24.472 --> 14:25.821
It was bad.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.258
Sergeant Ikande was able
to rescue the contractors,

14:28.302 --> 14:31.392
but lost his four men
in the process.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.872
He never returned to duty.

14:32.915 --> 14:36.310
I've reached out to him
several times, but no response.

14:36.353 --> 14:38.138
Tough hand's an understatement.

14:38.181 --> 14:39.487
Sergeant Ikande
went through hell.

14:39.530 --> 14:42.316
I can't begin to imagine
where his head's at.

14:42.359 --> 14:45.667
He was one of the best Marines
I had ever commanded.

14:45.710 --> 14:48.626
If you have to take him in,
try to keep him safe.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.672
We will.
Thank you, Major.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.070
Ruya Ghanem. Recently immigrated
from Tajikistan,

14:57.113 --> 14:58.680
everything else checks out.KENSI:
Thanks, Eric.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.769
Here you go.
Sorry about that.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.945
It's okay.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.947
When did you last see Odell?

15:04.991 --> 15:07.950
This morning. He went
to work, just like normal.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.126
He does maintenance
at the mosque

15:10.170 --> 15:12.607
on Glendale Avenue.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.784
Did Odell ever speak to a
reporter named Rebecca Frazier?

15:15.827 --> 15:17.829
Why?

15:18.874 --> 15:20.484
Because, unfortunately,

15:20.528 --> 15:22.834
she was killed
in an accident this morning.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.796
What does this
have to do with Odell?

15:27.839 --> 15:29.319
DeCHAMPS:
Maybe nothing.

15:29.363 --> 15:30.886
But we think he might have
information that would help

15:30.930 --> 15:32.932
with the investigation,
and we'd like to talk to him.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.151
KENSI:
I just have one
more question.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.153
Did Odell ever tell you anything
about his time in the Marines?

15:37.197 --> 15:38.328
No.
He's very private

15:38.372 --> 15:41.288
about this time of his life.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.337
SAM:
Got to feel for the guy.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.644
Lose one man, it sticks with
you the rest of your life.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.080
You lose four?Well,

15:51.124 --> 15:52.429
if he still felt guilty
about his guys,

15:52.473 --> 15:54.301
and Rebecca was gonna
go public with that,

15:54.344 --> 15:55.519
he might not
have taken it well.

15:55.563 --> 15:56.694
But enough to kill?

15:58.174 --> 16:00.307
We got to find out what happened
on that rescue mission.

16:00.350 --> 16:01.308
We are working on it.

16:01.351 --> 16:02.744
Well, in the meantime,

16:02.787 --> 16:04.702
a street cam caught
Rebecca's car turning

16:04.746 --> 16:06.356
onto the canyon road.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.010
ERIC:
And a moment later,
this white van

16:08.054 --> 16:09.316
makes the same turn.

16:09.359 --> 16:10.708
But if we skip forward...

16:12.797 --> 16:15.235
The same white van returns
only 15 minutes later,

16:15.278 --> 16:18.020
which times out perfectly with
the location of the accident.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.587
Hey. Kaleidoscope got
a hit on the van.

16:19.630 --> 16:22.198
It got off the 170 in North
Hollywood eight minutes ago.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.547
We're on it.

16:23.591 --> 16:25.375
Okay.

16:25.419 --> 16:28.335
ERIC:
Looks like they pulled into
an alley just ahead of you.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.685
CALLEN:
Copy that.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.865
Federal agents!
Show us your hands.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.347
Don't do it.

16:54.665 --> 16:57.103
Looks like these guys were
about to torch the van.

16:57.146 --> 17:00.236
Yeah, but still no Ikande.

17:13.641 --> 17:17.297
Looks like your dead men are
Diego Marin and Felix Gamero.

17:17.340 --> 17:21.040
A couple of misdemeanors between
them, but nothing of note.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.347
NELL:
However, both men have reported
ties to a gang called

17:24.391 --> 17:26.610
Imperio Azteca.And get this.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.786
After leaving the site
of Rebecca's accident,

17:28.830 --> 17:31.050
the van headed
towards Ikande's mosque.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.400
Maybe Ikande hired them
to do his dirty work,

17:33.443 --> 17:34.488
keep his hands clean.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.403
What do you have on Aztecas?

17:36.446 --> 17:37.708
NELL:
Not much.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.623
They're relatively
new players, so we don't even

17:39.667 --> 17:41.277
have any known hangouts.SAM: We got a bunch of

17:41.321 --> 17:43.105
parking tickets
from the 3500 block

17:43.149 --> 17:44.367
of San Fernando.
What's there?

17:45.629 --> 17:47.936
Uh, looks like a strip mall

17:47.979 --> 17:49.633
We got a liquor store,
laundromat,

17:49.677 --> 17:51.157
donut shop.We have a winner.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.900
I'm in the mood
for a cheat day.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.380
Thought you said
that yesterday.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.034
Let's do it.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.602
Just sent you the
after action reports

18:01.645 --> 18:03.343
from Sergeant Ikande's
rescue mission.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.040
Apparently, they were
only able to escape

18:05.084 --> 18:06.563
under the cover
of a drone strike,

18:06.607 --> 18:09.044
which caused collateral losses
in the village.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.741
NELL:
Okay, well, that could
be something else

18:10.785 --> 18:12.787
Ikande wanted to keep quiet.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.136
Whoa, there's a lot
of information here.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.877
It's gonna take us a while
to sort through.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.271
It looks like the civilian
contractors Ikande rescued

18:18.314 --> 18:21.752
were working
for a Schenley Electrical.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.450
They're no longer
operating abroad,

18:23.493 --> 18:25.626
but they do
have an office

18:25.669 --> 18:28.107
in Inglewood, and that is run
by a Phillip Beckett.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.239
He's one of the men
Ikande saved.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.937
Now, Ikande's phone records
show the last call he made

18:32.981 --> 18:34.591
was to Beckett's number.

18:34.635 --> 18:37.116
Send Schenley's location
to Kensi and DeChamps.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.640
Yeah.Yep.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.689
Hi, we're here to talk
to Phillip Beckett.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.735
Thanks.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.608
That's ideally the way
I'd like...

18:51.652 --> 18:52.827
Phillip Beckett.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.135
Can I help you?KENSIE:
Hi.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.484
Yes. We are NCIS.

18:57.527 --> 18:58.789
We are hoping you could
answer some questions

18:58.833 --> 19:00.356
about Sergeant Odell Ikande.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.967
Uh... uh...

19:03.011 --> 19:04.491
Could you
give us a minute?

19:06.928 --> 19:08.669
Thanks.Mm-hmm.

19:08.712 --> 19:11.672
Sorry, it's a...
a sensitive subject.

19:11.715 --> 19:14.153
We went through
a lot over there.Sure.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.851
Uh, why-why do you want
to know about Sergeant Ikande?

19:16.894 --> 19:18.766
He may be connected to
a case we're working on.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.463
We were just hoping you could
fill in some of the blanks

19:20.507 --> 19:21.595
about your rescue.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.337
Well, it all happened fast.

19:24.380 --> 19:28.297
Um, one minute, we're repairing
the village's generator,

19:28.341 --> 19:30.517
the next we're...

19:30.560 --> 19:32.301
pinned down under heavy fire.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.999
I mean, i-if it wasn't for
Sergeant Ikande and his team,

19:35.043 --> 19:36.827
I wouldn't be here today.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.220
Did you stay in touch
with him afterwards?

19:38.264 --> 19:39.613
Not really.

19:39.656 --> 19:42.920
But then, this morning,
he calls out of the blue.

19:42.964 --> 19:45.227
Only, he's not making sense.
He's-he's rambling.

19:45.271 --> 19:48.230
You know,
something about a car crash.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.014
I was worried,
but he hung up

19:50.058 --> 19:51.494
before I could
get any more info.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.670
I was hoping it was just
an episode, you know,

19:53.714 --> 19:55.411
PTSD or something.

19:55.455 --> 19:56.586
Did he say
anything about

19:56.630 --> 19:57.979
where he was
or where he was going?

19:58.022 --> 20:00.416
No, he didn't.
I-I'm sorry.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.418
I wish I could help more.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.507
I owe the guy big-time.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.814
It's okay.
Thank you.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.952
Huh.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.348
If Beckett was really worried
about Sergeant Ikande,

20:19.392 --> 20:20.523
he would have called him back.

20:20.567 --> 20:22.525
Well, according
to the phone records,

20:22.569 --> 20:23.874
he didn't receive
any more calls.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.398
Would be hard to turn down
someone down

20:25.441 --> 20:27.008
who saved your life
if they asked for help.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.532
You think Beckett's
covering for him?

20:30.577 --> 20:31.578
Check it out.

20:34.929 --> 20:37.497
Let's see where he goes. He
might lead us right to Ikande.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.248
Hey.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.556
You know, when I said
you had to be present,

20:53.600 --> 20:56.037
I didn't mean
quite this present.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.387
Can I ask you a question?Of course.

20:58.431 --> 21:01.912
If you went to a wedding and
there was no mother-son dance,

21:01.956 --> 21:03.305
would that be weird?

21:03.349 --> 21:06.134
Depends. Do the mom and son
hate each other?

21:06.177 --> 21:08.267
They're starting to.That's not the point, Mom.

21:08.310 --> 21:10.965
It's gonna be weird
if we don't do it.Weirder than if we dance

21:11.008 --> 21:12.314
to an inappropriate song?

21:12.358 --> 21:14.316
There's plenty
of great songs.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.665
Jeffrey, help me out here.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.885
Somehow, I don't think

21:17.928 --> 21:20.104
this is really about
the music selection.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.937
Okay. All right.
Mama,

21:26.981 --> 21:28.461
talk to me.
What's going on?

21:31.246 --> 21:33.596
Kensi's a great dancer.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.946
Her mom's a great dancer.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.427
Me?
I got two left feet, honey.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.037
How am I gonna
compete with that?

21:40.081 --> 21:42.518
All right, first off,
it's not a competition.

21:42.562 --> 21:45.434
Of course it is. All weddings
are, especially in our family.

21:45.478 --> 21:48.611
Who looked the best,
who gave the best speech.

21:48.655 --> 21:52.441
I don't want them talking about
me behind my back, Marty.

21:52.485 --> 21:55.139
I don't want to look like a fool
in front of everybody.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.706
Wait, are you serious?
Is that what you think

21:56.750 --> 21:58.186
is gonna happen?

22:00.406 --> 22:01.537
Mama...

22:02.495 --> 22:03.800
I don't mean
to interrupt,

22:03.844 --> 22:05.324
but the supply closets
are where?

22:05.367 --> 22:06.629
Oh, yeah, sure.

22:06.673 --> 22:08.675
Let me just show you.
It's right here.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.548
CALLEN:
If, in your opinion,

22:12.592 --> 22:15.290
this high-scale drink
between two single people

22:15.334 --> 22:17.553
does not constitute a date,
what-what exactly does?

22:17.597 --> 22:20.208
You're not gonna
let this go, are you?Not any time soon.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.079
Going on dates is about more
than just where you go,

22:22.123 --> 22:24.821
or what you wear.
It's about intent.And what was your intent?

22:24.865 --> 22:27.215
To be a good friend to someone
who's been a good friend to me.Well, you know,

22:27.258 --> 22:29.348
sometimes good friendships
can evolve into more.

22:29.391 --> 22:32.568
That's right. You and I--
we're just gonna stay friends.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.353
Okay.

22:34.396 --> 22:36.355
I'll try not to take it
personally.

22:41.708 --> 22:42.752
Can I help you?Hope so.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.014
NCIS.

22:44.058 --> 22:45.842
Vamanos. Vamanos.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.106
Huh.

22:49.150 --> 22:50.760
Something we said?

22:50.804 --> 22:52.719
Let me ask you
a question.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.068
Recognize either of these guys?

22:54.111 --> 22:56.592
Tough to say.

22:57.941 --> 23:00.988
This is a busy place.
I-I see a lot of faces.

23:01.031 --> 23:02.598
What about those
guys who just left?

23:02.642 --> 23:05.384
Oh, they mostly just hang out
and drink our crappy coffee.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.776
You ever listen
to what they're talking about?

23:09.083 --> 23:10.606
Uh...

23:10.650 --> 23:12.260
Not good to be
eavesdropping, man.

23:14.828 --> 23:17.221
You need, like,
warrants and stuff for that.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.049
You know what you don't
need a warrant for?

23:19.093 --> 23:20.877
Health violations.

23:20.921 --> 23:22.226
Mm.And I see plenty of them.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.228
Improper use of gloves,
no hair restraints.

23:24.272 --> 23:26.143
You know, our colleague
is actually with the
inspector right now,

23:26.187 --> 23:28.450
so if you'd like, we
could just call him...A-All right, all right.

23:30.234 --> 23:31.584
They mostly speak Spanish,

23:31.627 --> 23:34.891
but I've picked up
on some things.

23:34.935 --> 23:37.938
They roll with a crew
called the Imperio Azteca.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.200
Mm-hmm.

23:39.243 --> 23:40.375
Write that down.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.421
Mental note.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.684
Between you and me,

23:44.727 --> 23:46.816
I think they're planning
a race war.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.341
Yeah. They're angry dudes.
And I've heard them

23:50.385 --> 23:52.300
say blancoa lot.

23:52.343 --> 23:55.912
I mean, my-my grade school
Español is a bit rusty,

23:55.956 --> 23:58.524
but I know that means white.Ooh.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.134
Whitey.

24:01.309 --> 24:02.963
The Man.

24:03.006 --> 24:05.574
But, uh,

24:05.618 --> 24:08.098
you didn't hear that from me.

24:08.142 --> 24:09.099
No. Definitely not.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.100
Mm-hmm.Uh-uh.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.712
Of course not.

24:13.756 --> 24:15.236
Wow.

24:15.279 --> 24:17.586
Got a future.Yeah.

24:17.630 --> 24:19.109
Well, should we get a donut?

24:19.153 --> 24:20.981
I wouldn't let Otis eat here.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.330
He loves donuts.

24:22.373 --> 24:23.984
You can't feed donuts
to a sea lion.

24:24.027 --> 24:26.073
I mean, let alone
the beer you give him.

24:26.116 --> 24:28.815
It's light beer.
Everyone deserves a cheat day.

24:44.570 --> 24:45.875
KENSI:
Looks like he's stopping.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.181
Let's wait here.

24:53.666 --> 24:55.276
Was it hard for you?

24:55.319 --> 24:56.538
What?

24:56.582 --> 24:58.018
Testifying?You kidding?

24:58.061 --> 24:59.498
Reliving all those decisions?
It was hard to feel

24:59.541 --> 25:00.934
like Iwas not on trial.

25:02.152 --> 25:04.111
I've felt on trial
since the day it happened.

25:05.852 --> 25:09.508
Protection's an assignment
of split seconds.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.510
Some agents go an entire career
without seeing

25:11.553 --> 25:14.077
a credible threat
in the field, but...

25:14.121 --> 25:15.992
if you do, the rest
of your life, you're judged

25:16.036 --> 25:18.734
by what you do in those
fractions of a second.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.083
If you get it wrong...

25:20.127 --> 25:21.432
You didn't get it wrong.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.611
You saved your protectee.

25:25.654 --> 25:27.830
At the cost of his son.

25:31.094 --> 25:34.576
Look, every good agent
makes mistakes.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.797
And you are a great agent.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.322
You got to forgive yourself.

25:42.889 --> 25:44.543
That's easier said than done.

25:46.414 --> 25:47.937
Beckett's on the move again.

25:47.981 --> 25:49.896
Okay.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.294
That's Ikande.

25:57.338 --> 25:59.166
Don't spook him.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.215
Knife!

26:07.696 --> 26:09.350
Hey!

26:10.394 --> 26:11.961
I got Ikande!

26:22.232 --> 26:24.887
Federal agent!
Don't make me do it!

26:30.632 --> 26:33.722
Eric, I'm gonna
need an ambulance.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.289
Out of the way.
Out of the way.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.421
Hey.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.206
Where's Beckett?

26:56.527 --> 26:58.747
So the man with the knife
died en route to the hospital,

26:58.791 --> 27:01.358
but we've ID'd him
as Juan Hernandez.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.622
He's a suspected assassin
with ties to...

27:03.665 --> 27:04.840
any guesses?

27:04.884 --> 27:06.973
What is Imperio Azteca?

27:07.016 --> 27:09.105
Ding, ding, ding.
That's the Daily Double.

27:09.149 --> 27:10.672
Or triple, in this case.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.675
But at the boardwalk, Hernandez
was going after Ikande.

27:13.719 --> 27:15.634
Which means if Sergeant Ikande
was working with Azteca,

27:15.677 --> 27:17.374
something may have gone south
between them.

27:17.418 --> 27:20.247
Or maybe they were never
working together at all.

27:20.290 --> 27:21.857
Well, either way,
there is one person

27:21.901 --> 27:23.293
who can set the
story straight.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.779
Sorry I ran.Hmm.

27:30.823 --> 27:32.476
I just didn't know who to trust.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.956
I swear, I want to help.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.305
CALLEN:
Why don't you
start by telling us

27:35.349 --> 27:36.785
your connection
to Imperio Azteca?

27:36.829 --> 27:39.353
I have no idea what that is.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.007
So you didn't hire them
to kill Rebecca Frazier?

27:42.051 --> 27:43.357
Kill her?

27:43.400 --> 27:45.359
I was working with her.

27:47.491 --> 27:48.884
I'm not a violent man.

27:48.928 --> 27:50.886
Since I left active duty

27:50.930 --> 27:54.803
my faith has been the most
important thing to me.

27:54.847 --> 27:57.588
That's why I took
the job at the mosque.

27:57.632 --> 28:00.504
But that wasn't always the case.

28:00.548 --> 28:03.812
Innocent blood
has been on my hands.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.509
The drone strike

28:05.553 --> 28:08.251
that allowed you to escape
with the contractors.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.603
Because of my team's
involvement,

28:12.647 --> 28:15.563
those villagers' stories
were never properly told.

28:15.606 --> 28:17.739
I was working with Rebecca
to change that.

28:17.783 --> 28:20.568
Mm-hmm.
So what happened?You tell me.

28:20.611 --> 28:23.876
All I know is someone tried
to abduct me from the mosque.

28:23.919 --> 28:25.878
I was able to escape,

28:25.921 --> 28:29.533
but then I saw what happened
to Rebecca on the news.

28:29.577 --> 28:31.361
It seemed like it couldn't
be a coincidence,

28:31.405 --> 28:34.190
so I contacted the only other
person I could think of

28:34.234 --> 28:36.236
who was connected to the story.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.586
Phillip Beckett.

28:38.629 --> 28:39.848
CALLEN:
Somebody's trying to keep

28:39.892 --> 28:41.284
the story from getting out.

28:41.328 --> 28:42.764
The only other people
with something to lose

28:42.808 --> 28:45.767
are the contractors.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.769
Beckett did bolt
from the boardwalk.

28:49.684 --> 28:51.642
Was there anything strange
about the rescue?

28:52.687 --> 28:54.558
It was a nightmare.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.343
Some tiny village in Farah,

28:56.386 --> 28:58.214
not even sure
it'd show up on any maps.

28:58.258 --> 28:59.563
Awful approach,

28:59.607 --> 29:01.217
no good cover.

29:01.261 --> 29:04.786
We reached the contractors, but
getting out was another problem.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.527
The enemy was much stronger

29:06.570 --> 29:09.704
than reported:
well-armed and well-trained.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.837
Certainly didn't seem
like the ill-equipped rebels

29:11.880 --> 29:13.403
we usually dealt with.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.405
Maybe they weren't.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.062
The main crop in Farah is opium.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.761
The poppy trade is
controlled by the warlords.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.720
But why would they have attacked
the contractors?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.417
CALLEN:
Our friend from the donut shop

29:27.461 --> 29:28.854
might be onto something.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.812
Blancois also
the nickname for heroin,

29:30.856 --> 29:32.074
which is made from...

29:32.118 --> 29:33.032
Opium.

29:33.075 --> 29:34.947
Yeah.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.954
So there might be
something to this, guys.

29:41.997 --> 29:45.131
Uh, Schenley lost their
contract in Afghanistan

29:45.174 --> 29:46.654
shortly after the rescue,

29:46.697 --> 29:48.830
but the company's
spending practices

29:48.874 --> 29:50.484
certainly did not reflect that.

29:50.527 --> 29:51.964
And from a glance
at social media,

29:52.007 --> 29:54.575
neither did the lifestyles
of their execs.

29:54.618 --> 29:56.969
Even more incriminating,
the generator that Schenley was

29:57.012 --> 29:59.232
supposedly repairing
during the attack

29:59.275 --> 30:00.842
had failed once a month
like clockwork

30:00.886 --> 30:02.278
over the past year.

30:02.322 --> 30:04.803
While the other 27 generators
Schenley installed

30:04.846 --> 30:06.979
over that same period of time

30:07.022 --> 30:09.633
had three collective failures.That's a start,

30:09.677 --> 30:11.505
but how would they get
the drugs back here?

30:11.548 --> 30:13.333
After every time that specific
generator was repaired,

30:13.376 --> 30:16.118
Schenley sent back equipment
listed as broken.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.685
It was mostly trucks.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.295
Empty the gas tanks,

30:19.339 --> 30:21.297
you could fit a hell of a lot
of opium in there.

30:21.341 --> 30:23.691
Do it once a month for a year,
you got a serious stockpile.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.954
But then their deal with the
local warlord goes south.

30:25.998 --> 30:27.956
He tries to take them out,
but Ikande's fireteam

30:28.000 --> 30:30.306
comes to the rescue
having no idea about the drugs.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.047
KENSI:
And no one's any the wiser

30:32.091 --> 30:34.658
until Rebecca starts
digging into Ikande's story.ROGERS: Okay.

30:34.702 --> 30:36.138
Now we're getting somewhere.Guys,

30:36.182 --> 30:38.314
it looks like all
of Schenley's broken equipment

30:38.358 --> 30:40.882
was routed to a warehouse
near their office in Inglewood.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.797
SAM: It would be risky
to move it again.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.625
It's a good chance they're
refining the heroin there.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.627
It still amazes me
how you people

30:46.670 --> 30:47.976
can pull something like that

30:48.020 --> 30:51.153
out of a hat
and yet still be so...

30:51.197 --> 30:53.112
you.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.635
I'll get
a warrant authorized.

31:07.561 --> 31:08.605
Armed guard out front.

31:10.738 --> 31:11.913
Got him.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.317
In position.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.275
On your mark.

31:26.319 --> 31:27.886
Go, go.Federal agent! Drop your weapon!

31:43.858 --> 31:45.338
Federal agents!

31:53.737 --> 31:55.739
DeChamps!No shot. You?

31:55.783 --> 31:57.480
No. Callen, Sam!

31:57.524 --> 31:59.918
Where are you guys?

31:59.961 --> 32:01.049
Never mind.

32:01.093 --> 32:02.746
Clear.

32:02.790 --> 32:04.661
Clear.

32:08.056 --> 32:09.753
DeCHAMPS:
Looks like we were right.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.233
They were processing it
right here.

32:11.277 --> 32:13.061
Something's off.

32:13.105 --> 32:14.671
Not enough protection.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.673
Yeah. So where's the
rest of the gang?

32:16.717 --> 32:17.674
ERIC:
Guys, you got to see this.

32:17.718 --> 32:18.849
Beckett must think

32:18.893 --> 32:20.590
Ikande escaped
at the boardwalk

32:20.634 --> 32:23.419
because he just sent
this video to his cell.

32:24.594 --> 32:27.249
Why'd you have
to start digging, Odell?

32:27.293 --> 32:30.731
Look what you made me do.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.865
SAM: Who's this?KENSI: That's Ikande's roommate,

32:34.909 --> 32:36.128
Ruya.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.959
Ruya's not just my roommate.

32:41.002 --> 32:44.266
She's a survivor
of the drone attack.

32:45.398 --> 32:48.401
She's the one who brought
Rebecca the story.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.638
Ruya came over from Tajikistan,

33:08.682 --> 33:12.164
but her family's originally
from Afghanistan.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.862
They were visiting her aunt
in the village

33:14.905 --> 33:18.779
when the contractors
came under attack.

33:18.822 --> 33:22.000
She lost both of her parents
and her brother

33:22.043 --> 33:24.176
in the drone strike.

33:24.219 --> 33:26.047
How did you find her?

33:26.091 --> 33:27.396
I didn't.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.268
She found me.

33:29.311 --> 33:31.052
Her family had
been trying

33:31.096 --> 33:33.011
to immigrate for years

33:33.054 --> 33:34.969
and was finally
was granted a spot.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.363
She arrived alone

33:37.406 --> 33:39.756
and contacted Rebecca,
who tracked me down.

33:40.801 --> 33:43.195
I avoided her
at first.

33:44.631 --> 33:48.374
But once I learned who Ruya was,
I knew I owed her something.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.376
Anything.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.595
So I agreed to take her in

33:52.639 --> 33:55.555
and give Rebecca
my side of the story.

33:57.122 --> 34:00.908
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you about her before.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.085
She's...

34:04.129 --> 34:06.348
she's already
been through so much.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.223
CALLEN:
Is that them?

34:11.266 --> 34:13.399
They want to meet
at the old zoo in an hour.

34:13.442 --> 34:15.575
Well, we better act fast.
If Beckett finds out that Ruya's

34:15.618 --> 34:17.577
a survivor of the drone strike,
he's gonna kill her.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.100
CALLEN:
It's risky

34:19.144 --> 34:20.319
putting Ikande in play.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.625
We could use a double, but...No.

34:22.669 --> 34:24.801
Use me.

34:24.845 --> 34:26.542
It's the best way
to keep her alive.

34:28.762 --> 34:30.372
We can't force you to do this.

34:30.416 --> 34:33.158
If you're willing, you'd be
operating of your own accord.

34:35.203 --> 34:37.118
If it is my time,

34:37.162 --> 34:38.946
then I leave my fate to Allah.

34:38.989 --> 34:42.645
I'll gladly give up my life if
that means Ruya gets hers back.

34:46.171 --> 34:48.086
Once a Marine...

34:51.001 --> 34:53.613
Always a Marine.

34:57.573 --> 35:01.447
NELL:
The REACT team's almost done
sealing the perimeter.

35:01.490 --> 35:02.796
Copy that.

35:02.839 --> 35:04.450
What do you got, Eric?Uh, only about half

35:04.493 --> 35:06.495
the zoo's security cameras
still work,

35:06.539 --> 35:07.714
but I'm seeing a few figures

35:07.757 --> 35:09.759
between you and Callen
in that clearing.

35:09.803 --> 35:10.934
KENSI:
I got Beckett

35:10.978 --> 35:11.979
and a few other gunmen.

35:12.022 --> 35:14.024
I count five.

35:15.504 --> 35:18.159
Any sign of Ruya?No, not yet.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.031
ERIC:
Uh, hold on,
there's a sixth guy.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.424
He's hanging out
by the old enclosures.

35:22.468 --> 35:23.860
DeChamps, there should be
an accessway to your left.

35:23.904 --> 35:25.645
DeCHAMPS:
Got it.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.520
CALLEN:
Moving closer.

35:45.708 --> 35:47.188
SAM:
Okay, we're in position.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.016
Ikande, try to get
Beckett talking.

35:49.059 --> 35:51.061
Get Ruya out
while he's distracted.

35:56.806 --> 35:58.634
Thanks for coming,
Odell.

36:00.245 --> 36:02.029
How could you?

36:02.072 --> 36:04.684
What-- decide to make
a little extra money

36:04.727 --> 36:07.252
from that godforsaken country?

36:07.295 --> 36:09.906
Everyone else was.

36:42.417 --> 36:45.072
I lost four good men
rescuing you.

36:45.115 --> 36:48.336
I thank you for that,
I-I really do.

36:48.380 --> 36:49.859
Have you thanked
the villagers who died?

36:51.600 --> 36:53.428
That was regrettable,

36:53.472 --> 36:55.822
but unnecessary if we could have
just negotiated

36:55.865 --> 36:57.867
a new deal.

37:12.404 --> 37:13.535
Ruya's secure.

37:13.579 --> 37:15.755
Let's go.

37:15.798 --> 37:18.192
Why couldn't you just let it go?

37:19.759 --> 37:21.761
Some things can't be let go.

37:24.459 --> 37:25.808
Ain't that the truth.

37:28.071 --> 37:29.247
Federal agents!Drop it!

37:40.649 --> 37:42.347
Go ahead.

37:42.390 --> 37:44.174
Ikande.

37:46.655 --> 37:48.962
Do it.

37:49.005 --> 37:52.008
You're not mine to judge.

38:05.195 --> 38:07.546
Semper Fi.

38:08.634 --> 38:09.939
RUYA:
Odell.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.349
DeCHAMPS:
Rogers says it looks
like Schenley Electric

38:28.393 --> 38:31.570
was the money and brains
behind Imperio Azteca all along.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.136
So they created
a Mexican street gang

38:33.180 --> 38:35.269
to hide where the drugs
were coming from.

38:36.618 --> 38:38.925
Shrewd.Not shrewd enough.

38:38.968 --> 38:41.057
Schenley's offices are being
raided and Rebecca's editor

38:41.101 --> 38:43.408
is gonna finish her story with
the help of Ikande and Ruya.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.671
That's a nice ending.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.067
Thanks for last night, Sam.

38:51.111 --> 38:52.982
I needed that.

38:54.593 --> 38:56.943
And if I can ever do the same
for you, let me know.

38:56.986 --> 38:59.641
Absolutely.

38:59.685 --> 39:02.340
Hopefully it won't take another
trial to get us together again.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.516
I have a feeling it won't.

39:04.559 --> 39:06.561
Good night, Sam.Good night.

39:09.129 --> 39:11.000
Good night, Callen.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.262
Night.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.439
Don't start.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.223
I'm not
in the mood.

39:16.266 --> 39:19.052
I know you said that

39:19.095 --> 39:20.880
whatever happened last
night wasn't a date...

39:20.923 --> 39:22.055
Because it wasn't.

39:22.098 --> 39:23.665
But if it was...

39:25.885 --> 39:27.147
...you know that's okay, right?

39:28.888 --> 39:30.672
I appreciate that, G.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.413
But I don't know what
I'm looking for right now,

39:32.457 --> 39:34.372
and I'm not in
any rush to find it.

39:34.415 --> 39:37.592
And there's nothing wrong
with that.

39:37.636 --> 39:38.941
I mean, even the big man's

39:38.985 --> 39:40.290
got to take baby steps
once in a while.

39:40.334 --> 39:41.509
See?

39:41.553 --> 39:43.337
And you were doing so well.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.425
One for two with
heartfelt moments?

39:44.469 --> 39:45.426
Come on, that's not half bad.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.601
That's exactly half bad.

39:46.645 --> 39:47.950
That's one for two.

39:47.994 --> 39:49.648
We can't all be
mathletes, all right?

39:49.691 --> 39:52.346
For the last time,
it's Junior Math Olympian.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.783
Never heard of it.

39:54.827 --> 39:56.611
Finally finished.

39:56.655 --> 39:59.527
Only one minor
violation,

39:59.571 --> 40:01.224
exceptional for new owners.

40:01.268 --> 40:03.096
Thanks, Mr. Kelly,
I'll tell Martin.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.188
On a personal note...

40:10.190 --> 40:13.672
...if given the chance to dance,

40:13.715 --> 40:15.238
always dance.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.390
What are you doing, Marty?

40:36.434 --> 40:39.698
You, me, dance floor,
right now.

40:39.741 --> 40:41.221
We're doing this.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.310
Everybody's looking.

40:43.353 --> 40:45.312
Don't worry about them,
don't worry about anybody,

40:45.355 --> 40:48.315
'cause the truth is that I will
look like a fool ten times over

40:48.358 --> 40:51.274
before I ever let you look
like a fool in front of anybody.

40:53.189 --> 40:56.149
Even if that means
I have to accidentally trip

40:56.192 --> 40:58.717
and huck my carcass into
the chocolate fountain

40:58.760 --> 40:59.935
at my own wedding.

40:59.979 --> 41:01.850
Nice and easy,
it's not so bad, right?

41:01.894 --> 41:03.896
Speak for yourself.

41:03.939 --> 41:05.375
Hey.

41:05.419 --> 41:08.988
It doesn't matter
who's watching.

41:09.031 --> 41:10.772
Doesn't matter what
dress you're wearing.

41:10.816 --> 41:13.383
It doesn't matter
what we're dancing to.

41:13.427 --> 41:15.124
'Cause the only thing
that matters

41:15.168 --> 41:16.996
is you did a great
job with me, Mama.

41:18.606 --> 41:21.043
And I want everybody
to know that.

41:22.088 --> 41:25.657
More importantly,
I want you to know that.

41:25.700 --> 41:27.702
You know that, right?

41:30.226 --> 41:32.533
Oh, thanks, Boo.

41:35.405 --> 41:37.712
Do you think you can manage
that at the wedding?

41:40.672 --> 41:42.804
I love you so much.

41:42.848 --> 41:45.415
I love you, too.

41:45.459 --> 41:47.417
You ready for
the big finish?

41:47.461 --> 41:50.029
What big finish?

41:50.072 --> 41:51.334
Trust me.

42:07.742 --> 42:09.222
Come here. Oh, wow.

42:09.265 --> 42:10.832
We're gonna dance
like we're in the '60s,

42:10.876 --> 42:12.442
like we're hippies?

42:14.532 --> 42:16.011
I was a good hippie.

42:16.055 --> 42:18.579
DEEKS: I bet you were
the best hippie.
