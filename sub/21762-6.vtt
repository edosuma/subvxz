My ex, Mary Ann, is a Foosa.

in the Jungle Games.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.000
One can only imagine

02:06.084 --> 02:09.003
what's going through King Julien's head
at a time like this.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.213
Probably a "What the!",

02:10.296 --> 02:11.339
"Oh, no, you didn't."

02:11.422 --> 02:13.174

I'm sorry but Uncle King Julien's right.

According to the bylaws,
any sovereign nation is permitted

02:41.578 --> 02:43.663
-the "worst person in the world!"

-It doesn't say that.
-Whoa.

Oh, you see, I already closed the book,
otherwise I would totally show you

02:50.879 --> 02:53.214
the very real thing that I just said
that's totally real.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.050
You know, I might be
the worst person in the world,

02:56.134 --> 02:59.053
but you are the worst liar in the world.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.179
Why, thank you.

Oh, hey! What! Fine!

Be in the Games, but,
I... I don't have to like it.

03:07.896 --> 03:08.730

-How could you be on his team?
-[Sage] Hm...

03:14.193 --> 03:16.237
Actually, I'm not surprised
you are on his team.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.156
Nephew, nephew, nephew.

03:18.239 --> 03:22.368
You can't blame Crimson and Sage
for wanting to be on the winning team.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.079
Pfft. Well, then, they should
have been on my team

03:25.163 --> 03:28.291
because there's no way
my kingdom won't win.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.542

-Yeah!

-Yeah!

-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!

03:31.878 --> 03:35.757
Well, if you're so confident,
how about making a little wager?

03:35.840 --> 03:39.510
Oh, I've got a better idea.
How about we make a bet? Mm-hmm.

And if, [coughs] when [coughs]
my kingdom wins the Games,

you will go away and never come back

03:52.607 --> 03:55.401

that I've got Hans on my team.

Oh, yeah. Wait. Who's Hans?

04:29.060 --> 04:31.688

04:31.771 --> 04:32.647
Why haven't I met him?

04:32.730 --> 04:35.817
Oh, he doesn't get out much.
Always in the gym training.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.610
You know, that's what makes him so good.

04:37.735 --> 04:40.196
True. Hans is pretty good,
but... [stammers]

04:40.280 --> 04:41.948
Pretty good? He's the best.

04:42.198 --> 04:47.245
Seriously, Hans, for us to lose,
would have to be, like, uh, dead.

04:47.328 --> 04:48.413
[shouting] Hans is dead!

04:49.122 --> 04:50.456
But he can't be dead!

No, he's definitely dead.

-No, Maurice.

05:04.220 --> 05:07.557
Why did Hans have to pick today to die?

05:07.640 --> 05:11.019
Actually, from the look of the decay,
I think he's been dead for a while.

05:11.102 --> 05:14.397
Probably years. Oh, the irony!

05:14.480 --> 05:15.815

-Reminds me of the time Mary Ann and I--

07:20.356 --> 07:21.274
You said it, Horst.

07:21.357 --> 07:24.569
But Uncle King Julien
shouldn't count his toucans just yet

07:24.652 --> 07:27.488
because here comes
reigning champion, Hans.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.116
[Xixi] If I didn't know any better,

07:30.199 --> 07:33.703
I'd say Hans is looking
a little under the weather.

07:33.995 --> 07:37.999
Well, maybe he had his heart broken
by a carnivorous she-devil.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.250
You're a kidder.

-Did his arm just fly off?
-That it did, Horst.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.768
But according to the rules,
the thrower must fully release the spear

07:57.852 --> 08:00.104
or the throw is disqualified
and since, technically...

08:00.188 --> 08:01.022
[whistles]

08:01.105 --> 08:04.650

to be in the Games.

08:35.806 --> 08:38.976
King Julien. I found Hans' arm for you.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.937
What am I supposed to do with that?

08:41.020 --> 08:43.731
No, Mort, if you want to help,
then please get Hans out of here

08:43.814 --> 08:45.024
so I can think.

08:45.441 --> 08:46.859
But, King Julien--

Now, Mort!

08:49.111 --> 08:50.613
Let's go, Fester.

Eh.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.533
Hans is out.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.618
We need a new champion, stat!

08:55.993 --> 08:58.079
I'll round up the usual suspects.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.044
Hm. This is the best we got?

09:05.920 --> 09:06.754
Yep.

Uh-uh.

09:08.422 --> 09:09.257
Here's an idea.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.259
Why don't you participate in the Games?

Uh... Your Majesty?

09:19.100 --> 09:21.769
For a very good reason
that I don't want to talk about now.

09:21.852 --> 09:22.937
I've made my decision.

09:23.020 --> 09:25.147
Clover, you will represent
the kingdom in the Games.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.359
[shrieks] I mean, ahem,
thank you, Sir. I won't let you down.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.820
I, uh, I better go and practice.
[laughs gleefully]

09:30.903 --> 09:31.737
[laughs sarcastically]

09:31.821 --> 09:34.657
There's no need for practice
because we're going to cheat.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.033
[gasps] Cheat?

09:36.117 --> 09:37.159
What, I... No.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.371
I'm gonna play by the rules,
and win fair and square.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.081
Yeesh. Ted, you're in.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.417
Oh, I'll cheat for you, King Julien.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.044
Like an Old West cardsharp
with an ace in his pocket

09:47.128 --> 09:48.254
and two pistols on his hip.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.672
Pew! Pew!

09:50.673 --> 09:52.592
[blows] I'll just put these away.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.806
Oh. I should be with my King Julien
in his time of need,

09:58.889 --> 10:01.017
instead of babysitting Hans.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.727
[groaning loudly]

10:03.769 --> 10:05.938
Would you like one of my flowers?

10:08.816 --> 10:10.359
Whoa! [screaming]

10:12.445 --> 10:14.030
[Hans shouting gibberish]

10:16.949 --> 10:18.993
[giggling] Again!

10:20.536 --> 10:21.454
Whee!

10:22.163 --> 10:23.372
Again! Again!

10:24.332 --> 10:25.333
Whee!

10:25.583 --> 10:27.335

10:27.752 --> 10:28.586
[laughing]

10:28.669 --> 10:29.962
[shouting unintelligibly]

10:30.046 --> 10:30.880
Huh?

10:31.255 --> 10:33.174
♪ La, la, la, la, la... ♪

10:33.257 --> 10:34.634
[talking gibberish]

10:36.135 --> 10:38.179
Oh, Hans. [giggling]

10:38.971 --> 10:42.350
[Xixi]  Welcome back to Day Two
of the Jungle Games.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.269
The champions are lining up
for the Speed-walking event.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.480
[whistles]

10:47.563 --> 10:48.606
And they're off!

10:53.527 --> 10:54.654
[voice shouting] Help!

10:55.112 --> 10:56.364
-[voice continues] Help!
-[panting]

10:56.447 --> 10:57.657
Help!

10:57.740 --> 11:02.286
Oh, no. An animal, or possibly a plant,
is calling for my help.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.663
Help!

11:03.746 --> 11:08.501
I am just an animal or possibly a plant
that needs assistance.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.044
[squawking like a bird]

11:13.089 --> 11:13.923
[bird screeching]

11:14.006 --> 11:15.758
Wait a minute! What is that oaf doing?

11:15.841 --> 11:17.218
[bird screeching]

11:17.301 --> 11:18.302
Snap!

11:19.387 --> 11:20.346

I... [groans] Mother...

11:24.600 --> 11:25.434
[cheering]

11:25.935 --> 11:27.895
[Xixi] And with a clean win of that event,

11:27.978 --> 11:29.814
Team Julien takes the lead.

11:30.606 --> 11:31.440
[Uncle Julien growling]

11:31.732 --> 11:32.775
[mockingly] Uh-hm.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.568
All right, Nephew.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.696
You want to play dirty, we'll play dirty.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.241
-You're in.
-With pleasure.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.743
This is a relatively new event called

-Competitive Packing.
-[horn toots]

11:44.745 --> 11:46.580
-[all straining]
-You can do this, Teddy.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.749
[Xixi] Everyone appears to be struggling.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.503
Real struggling is having to pry yourself

11:52.586 --> 11:56.048
out of your wife's jaws
on your wedding night.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.967
Okay, solids on the bottom.
Roll, don't fold.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.051
Wait.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.595
Oh, wow, looks like Ted is doing great.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.139
Make sure the underwear can breathe.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.849
[Xixi]  He's a shoe-in for victory.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.100
[exclaims in frustration]

12:06.308 --> 12:07.351
Mm-hmm.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.687
This is just so second nature to me.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.604
[scorpion screeching]

12:11.564 --> 12:13.190
[exclaiming and screaming in pain]

12:15.943 --> 12:17.111
I do'd it.

-Huh?
-Ha, ha!

12:18.529 --> 12:22.658
Next event,
Competitive Water Skiing and Shark Jump.

12:22.741 --> 12:25.953
Hey, babe, I got this one.
Heck, I invented it.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.372
[Xixi]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.584
They are literally "jumping the shark."

12:49.727 --> 12:54.148
Oh, Clo-Clo, your precious king
is going to lose his kingdom

12:54.231 --> 12:56.066
and you're going to be out of a job.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.235
-Aha! Yeah...
-[growling]

12:58.319 --> 12:59.195
Oh, hey, Clover.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.532

13:04.116 --> 13:05.034
You look great, buddy,

13:05.117 --> 13:06.911
-let's get back out there.
-[sobbing]

13:06.994 --> 13:10.331
Put me in, coach.
I'll lie, I'll cheat, I'll steal.

13:10.414 --> 13:12.666
Just put me in.

13:12.958 --> 13:13.792
He, he!

13:16.378 --> 13:17.922
[humming]

13:21.091 --> 13:22.301
[groans loudly]

13:23.886 --> 13:25.804
Nice weather we've been having.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.224
Wouldn't you agree, Hans?

13:28.307 --> 13:29.683
-[Hans groaning]
-[laughs]

13:29.767 --> 13:30.851
Oh, Hans.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.978
-You're a real  mensch.
-[knocking at door]

13:33.062 --> 13:34.230
Who could that be?

13:37.441 --> 13:39.485
I am looking for Hans.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.028
Why?

13:41.111 --> 13:43.739
I plan to take Hans' hands

13:43.822 --> 13:46.283
and do the first hand transplant

13:46.367 --> 13:49.286
[shouting] out of a cave!

13:51.121 --> 13:53.082
[thunderclaps]

13:53.165 --> 13:55.626
[gasps] You're going to take his hands?

13:55.709 --> 13:58.170
I might take his feet, too.

13:59.046 --> 14:02.591
And I've got a few friends
who need some other parts.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.636
So, do you know where I might find him?

14:05.719 --> 14:07.221
Uh, no. Haven't seen him.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.892
-[Dr. S] I'm still here.
-I told you, I don't know where he is.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.980
That mean snake doctor is after you, Hans.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.732
You have to hide.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.402
Hm... No, that's not gonna work.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.696
[Hans groaning]

14:23.779 --> 14:25.322
Scrunch, Hans, scrunch.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.324
Meet me halfway, Hans.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.534
Ugh!

14:29.118 --> 14:30.160
[Hans groaning]

14:30.244 --> 14:31.203
Eh...

14:31.829 --> 14:32.663
[sighing in relief]

14:33.789 --> 14:34.915
Hello, Mort!

14:34.999 --> 14:36.417
Any sign of Hans?

14:36.500 --> 14:37.710
No.

14:38.752 --> 14:41.380
[lemur shouting in terror] Toilet Zombie!

14:41.463 --> 14:42.715
There he is.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.844
[shouting in panic]

14:47.678 --> 14:49.346
[crowd cheering]

14:50.139 --> 14:51.390
[both grunting]

14:55.019 --> 14:56.729
Miss it, Clo-Clo. Miss it.

14:56.812 --> 14:57.730
Miss it!

14:58.647 --> 15:00.900
-Hey! You did that on purpose.
-[whistle blows]

15:00.983 --> 15:02.818
It's all about concentration,

15:02.902 --> 15:03.986
-sister girl.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.073
-[growls]
-[whistle blows]

15:08.991 --> 15:10.826
A fight's broken out on the field.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.870
And is that Hans?

15:12.953 --> 15:14.163
Ow!

15:15.623 --> 15:16.957
[shouting in panic]

15:17.499 --> 15:18.334
[gasps]

15:19.919 --> 15:20.794
[Dr. S] Stop.

15:21.879 --> 15:24.381
Stop that hand donor!

15:24.465 --> 15:25.716
The judges have ruled.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.217
-Mary Ann!
-Both Crimson and Clover

15:27.301 --> 15:29.929
are being disqualified from the Games.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.057
That means Clumsy Pete
wins this event by default.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.351
Which button is it again?

15:36.352 --> 15:38.312
[Clumsy Pete shouting in pain]

15:39.146 --> 15:42.107
[Mort panting] I think we lost him.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.944
[Hans groaning]

15:45.027 --> 15:46.403
You have to go, Hans.

15:46.695 --> 15:50.574
Far away so he can't find you
and take your hands or your feet

15:50.658 --> 15:52.034
or any of your other parts.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.370
[groaning loudly]

15:54.453 --> 15:55.871
Oh, go!

15:55.955 --> 15:58.916
Don't ya understand,
I'm not your friend anymore.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.877
You're just a big, undead, dead guy.

16:01.961 --> 16:02.920
[exclaims]

16:03.003 --> 16:04.755
You mean nothing to me.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.465
Nothing!

16:06.548 --> 16:08.550
[groaning loudly]

16:11.679 --> 16:14.139
I'm sorry, friend.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.476
[Hans shouting] Oh!

16:17.559 --> 16:19.895
[sobbing]

16:20.729 --> 16:21.605
[male voice snickering]

16:21.689 --> 16:23.649
What were you thinking, Clover?

16:23.732 --> 16:25.234
I'm so sorry, Your Majesty.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.027
How could you get kicked out of the Games?

16:27.111 --> 16:29.279
Who's going to compete in the final event?

16:29.363 --> 16:30.698
[male voice snickering]

16:30.781 --> 16:31.907
I mean, okay.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.201
Whoever's doing the evil laugh thing,
stop it right now.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.246
Hi. I was just reacquainting
my butt with your throne.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.957
You know, since I'll be sitting
in it real soon.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.167
Do whatever you want
with your butt, Uncle,

16:42.251 --> 16:46.338
just don't do it here
because my throne will never be yours.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.297
Never!

16:47.381 --> 16:49.466
Oh, come on,
it's time to face facts, Nephew.

16:49.550 --> 16:53.178
You've got to get a perfect score
in the final event just to tie my score.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.847
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.224
This scoring system makes no sense!

16:57.641 --> 16:59.268
Your throne is as good as mine.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.854
Isn't that wonderful? Toodles.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.731
[laughing]

17:03.814 --> 17:06.400
You'll have to compete
in the final event now, King Julien.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.319
It's Rhythmic Trampoline.
That's your event.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.947
There's no way you can lose.
Come on, let's go.

17:13.949 --> 17:14.783
[trembling]

17:14.867 --> 17:15.993
[Leonard screaming]

17:16.076 --> 17:18.996
[male lemur]
King Julien killed him, murderer!

17:19.079 --> 17:20.039
[spits]

17:21.457 --> 17:23.042
Oh, hey. He, he.

17:25.002 --> 17:25.836
Hi.

17:25.919 --> 17:29.089
Oh, the excitement is palpable.
Can you feel it, Horst?

17:29.173 --> 17:30.382
-[grunting]
-Horst?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.510
-Hor--
-[stammering]

17:33.719 --> 17:36.472
And I spilled it!

17:36.847 --> 17:40.392
Due to Clumsy Pete's injury,
King Joey is in for the Rats.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.685
He'll go first.

17:41.769 --> 17:42.686
[sniffs]

17:43.562 --> 17:44.521
-What?
-Huh?

17:44.980 --> 17:46.690
[laughing]

17:48.776 --> 17:52.154
[Xixi] Looked like he was really
having fun out there.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.322
[snickering]

17:54.156 --> 17:55.449
[crowd cheering]

17:56.575 --> 17:57.951
[grunting]

18:00.829 --> 18:03.207
Ha! Hey! Huh! Hyuh!

18:04.458 --> 18:07.795
Ooh! Clearly someone's been practicing.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.547
Huh, hyeh!

18:11.590 --> 18:12.591
[all cheering]

18:12.674 --> 18:13.884
[burps]

18:13.967 --> 18:15.385
Beat that, Nephew.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.638
No, I can't do it, Maurice.

18:17.721 --> 18:21.183
You've performed trampoline routines
a thousand times. What's wrong?

18:21.266 --> 18:23.602
There's something
I've never told you, Maurice.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.354
Something from my past.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.688
Before we met.

18:26.772 --> 18:30.442
As a young prince, I used to compete
in pair tramping tournaments.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.528
I had a partner named Leonard.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.487
We were good.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.697
No, we were better than good.
We were the best.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.575
'Til the accident.

18:38.992 --> 18:41.411
It was nationals. The final event.

18:41.495 --> 18:45.124
I went for our signature flip,
but I landed too hard and...

18:45.207 --> 18:46.333
[Leonard screaming]

18:46.416 --> 18:47.960
[Julien]  And Leonard was gone.

18:48.043 --> 18:52.047
It was that day I vowed
never to tramp competitively again.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.924
I didn't want anyone else to get hurt.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.802
Like Leonard. May he rest in peace.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.720
Leonard didn't die.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.722
Oh, Maurice-- Wait, he didn't die?

19:00.806 --> 19:02.599
No, he just retired.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.935
He's actually in the stands
watching you right now.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.562
Hi, King Julien.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.480
Hey, Leonard.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.399
Hey! Why didn't anyone tell me?

19:10.482 --> 19:13.694
I've been carrying all this guilt
around with me for years.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.237
You never seemed that guilty.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.197
Because I'm like an onion, Maurice.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.074
There's a lotta layers up in here.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.450
[sighs]

19:20.534 --> 19:22.077
It's time, King Julien.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.413
Time to put the past
and your fear of hurting people

19:24.496 --> 19:28.375
with your mad tramping skills behind you
and win this for your kingdom.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.043
Okay, let's do this.

19:30.127 --> 19:31.003
For Leonard.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.588
-Hi, Leonard.
-[Leonard] Hi!

19:36.800 --> 19:38.177
[classical music playing]

20:12.753 --> 20:14.171
[crowd cheering]

20:17.382 --> 20:18.550
[sobbing]

20:19.760 --> 20:22.179
Way to go, King Julien.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.305
Thanks, Leonard.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.474
Now, that I know you're alive,
let's get lunch.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.727
-You know, catch up and stuff.
-You got it, partner.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.063
The judges have made their decision.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.856
King Julien nailed it.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.400
He got a perfect score
in the Rhythmic Trampoline event.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.860
-I'll take that.
-[Xixi] He wins it!

20:36.944 --> 20:39.321
-[both straining]
-Gimme that, you used juice box.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.241
Bringing us to the final scores, they are,

20:42.324 --> 20:44.493
Team King Julien with ten,

20:44.576 --> 20:46.578
Team Feartopia with ten,

20:46.662 --> 20:48.163
and The Rat Kingdom with...

20:48.247 --> 20:51.625
-[gasps] 132!
-[crowd cheering]

20:51.708 --> 20:56.046
The winner of the 64th
Every-So-Often Jungle Games are,

20:56.129 --> 20:57.047
The Rats.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.131
Say what!

20:58.715 --> 21:00.384
I just heard our names.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.635
[cheering and laughing]

21:02.886 --> 21:04.596
Isn't this exciting, Horst?

21:04.680 --> 21:09.643
[crying loudly] Mary Ann! Come back to me!

21:09.726 --> 21:11.603
-Mary Ann!
-I have had it!

21:11.687 --> 21:13.438
You need to move on, Horst!

21:13.522 --> 21:15.816
King Julien, do you know what this means?

21:15.899 --> 21:17.276
I lost?

21:17.359 --> 21:19.903
This is what losing feels like?
I don't like it.

21:19.987 --> 21:23.907
And your kingdom, your kingdom,
your kingdom is mine!

21:23.991 --> 21:25.367
Let me say it one more time!

21:25.450 --> 21:26.827
-Ah! [crashes]
-Not so fast!

21:27.077 --> 21:30.497
[Maurice] Team Julien and Team Feartopia
are tied for second place.

21:30.580 --> 21:31.957
Neither one beat the other,

21:32.040 --> 21:34.835
so that means King Julien
keeps his kingdom.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.461
Uh, hm.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.214
Hey, Uncle.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.466
[shouts] In your face! [laughing]

21:44.845 --> 21:47.472
King Joey, you just won the Jungle Games.

21:47.556 --> 21:50.684
-We won?
-What are you going to do next?

21:50.767 --> 21:53.270
We're gonna build a maze!

21:53.353 --> 21:54.187
Hm?

21:54.938 --> 21:58.525
You know, Maurice, the Games
made me realize something important.

21:58.608 --> 22:01.069
That wagering the kingdom in a bet
isn't a good idea?

22:01.153 --> 22:02.612
No, don't be silly.

22:02.696 --> 22:07.826
[inhales deeply] Yup, I faced my fear
of competitive tramping in the face.

22:07.909 --> 22:08.744
True, but--

22:08.827 --> 22:11.997
But nothing, and even though I lost,

22:12.080 --> 22:15.042
I still kept my kingdom.
That's how good I am.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.045
Even when I lose, I win.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.254
[laughs]

22:19.338 --> 22:23.091
[sighing] I don't know
why I even got outta bed this morning.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.968
[continues laughing]

22:25.052 --> 22:25.886
Yes!

22:28.221 --> 22:29.056
[sighs]

22:29.139 --> 22:30.015
-[Hans moaning]
-[gasps]

22:32.726 --> 22:33.769
Oh!

22:34.227 --> 22:36.354
[Hans groaning loudly]

22:36.438 --> 22:38.065
[giggling]

22:38.774 --> 22:39.649
Hm?

22:40.984 --> 22:43.904
