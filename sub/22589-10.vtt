<i>Ma Parker come to town...</i>

01:24.335 --> 01:26.462
<i>Was the Batmobile blasted?</i>

<i>Boy Wonder bombed?</i>

02:46.376 --> 02:47.502
That's right, warden.

02:47.710 --> 02:52.840
When the Batmobile's speedometer hits 60,
that's the end of Batman and Robin.

02:55.176 --> 02:58.388
Gosh, I'm hungry.
I hope Aunt Harriet has a good meal waiting.

02:58.596 --> 03:00.515
Let's go faster.

03:01.057 --> 03:02.225
You see that sign, Robin?

03:02.433 --> 03:05.144
"Speed limit, 55 miles an hour."

03:05.353 --> 03:07.522
A good driver
always observes the speed laws.

03:07.730 --> 03:09.691
It's the best way to stay out of trouble.

03:09.899 --> 03:11.526
You're right.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.696
What worries me is what that trustee said.

03:14.904 --> 03:16.072
What was that?

03:16.280 --> 03:20.284
That Warden Crichton does 70 miles per hour
on this road.

03:20.493 --> 03:23.454
The warden wouldn't break the speed laws.

03:23.663 --> 03:27.834
Maybe he wanted us to drive faster.

03:28.042 --> 03:31.212
Maybe he wasn't just looking
at the Batmobile engine.

03:42.348 --> 03:44.684
Just as I thought, dynamite.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.855
There, that was it.

03:49.063 --> 03:51.983
We've just dynamited the dynamic duo.

03:53.860 --> 03:56.988
Now there won't be any interference
with my plans.

03:57.196 --> 04:00.575
We got everything here we need:
The personnel, the talent, the weapons...

04:00.783 --> 04:04.120
...and the perfect hideout.
-Hideout?

04:04.328 --> 04:06.164
Sure. When we start pulling our jobs...

04:06.372 --> 04:08.875
...who'll think of looking for the culprits
in the penitentiary?

04:11.419 --> 04:14.505
Heaven help us. It might work.

04:14.714 --> 04:17.675
Sure, it's gonna work.
And you know why, warden?

04:17.884 --> 04:20.678
Because the pen is mightier than the sword.

04:23.598 --> 04:24.891
Ma, you're a riot.

04:25.099 --> 04:26.726
Yeah, a prison riot.

04:28.186 --> 04:30.229
All right. Now let's get down to business.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.982
Legs, you go take down those curtains.

04:33.191 --> 04:36.486
Oh, Ma, why take them down?
They make the place look real nice.

04:36.694 --> 04:38.988
Whoever heard of a warden's office
looking nice?

04:39.197 --> 04:42.492
I want everything here
to look business-like and functional.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.702
- When did you learn them words?
-Never mind.

04:44.911 --> 04:47.538
We're gonna save the homey touches
for the cell block.

04:47.747 --> 04:50.082
Now, I wanna talk to that cook
about the chow.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.794
We serve the best food in the penal system.

04:53.002 --> 04:56.798
Maybe so, warden. But from now on,
every night is gonna be steak and potato night.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.925
- Oh, yeah!
-Yeah!

04:59.133 --> 05:01.636
When we've got this place
policed up real good...

05:01.844 --> 05:03.930
...we'll start getting down to real business.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.973
Yeah!

05:06.766 --> 05:09.685
Why would a trustee put dynamite
in the Batmobile, Robin?

05:09.894 --> 05:11.896
He certainly isn't someone you could trust.

05:12.104 --> 05:14.816
A prison is full of social outcasts, Robin.

05:15.024 --> 05:18.653
Some of them seeking revenge,
and one can hardly blame them.

05:18.861 --> 05:21.030
Maybe one of the prisoners
put him up to it.

05:21.239 --> 05:24.700
- Maybe even Ma Parker.
-Mm.

05:24.909 --> 05:27.370
- What next, Batman?
-We're heading back.

05:38.548 --> 05:40.967
Sorry to disturb you again, warden...

05:41.175 --> 05:43.719
...but I wanted to make sure
everything was all right.

05:43.928 --> 05:46.305
Why, of course everything is all right.

05:46.514 --> 05:47.640
Why shouldn't it be?

05:47.849 --> 05:50.685
I note some changes in your office decor.

05:50.893 --> 05:53.604
It seems a trifle drab.

05:53.813 --> 05:56.899
It's, uh, just being renovated.

05:57.108 --> 06:00.653
And someone almost renovated the Batmobile
with dynamite.

06:00.862 --> 06:02.405
That's why we're worried.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.574
Probably an unfortunate mistake.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.744
Still, I can't help thinking
that Ma Parker had something to do with it.

06:08.953 --> 06:10.162
Why,nonsense.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.874
I can show you
that Ma Parker is safely put away.

06:13.082 --> 06:14.458
Oh.

06:22.383 --> 06:24.260
You see, snug as a bug, Batman.

06:24.468 --> 06:28.723
You're keeping Ma Parker and her daughter
in the same cell block with the boys?

06:28.931 --> 06:34.478
Uh, yes, it--
it's what I call my family plan, Batman.

06:34.687 --> 06:40.985
It's my theory that the family
that dorms together, reforms together.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.158
Let's see the children.

06:54.790 --> 06:56.500
Mm-hm.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.406
There, you see'? Everything is fine, Batman.

07:27.615 --> 07:31.118
Thank you, warden.
Everything looks A-okay.

07:33.204 --> 07:35.206
All right, Robin. Let's go.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.794
Nice work, warden.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.629
One peep out of you...

07:41.837 --> 07:44.715
...and it would have been curtains
for Batman and Robin.

07:44.924 --> 07:48.970
This is certainly a black day
for Gotham City.

07:49.428 --> 07:52.848
All right, you, open these here doors now.

07:54.308 --> 07:56.060
Not that way, Knucklehead.

07:56.268 --> 08:00.940
These doors only open and close electrically.
Pull the master switch.

08:15.579 --> 08:18.749
Now, boys, you listen to me
and you listen to me good.

08:19.250 --> 08:22.503
It's taken me months
to organize this here little party...

08:22.712 --> 08:24.964
...and now we are in business.

08:28.509 --> 08:31.262
We got everything we need right here.

08:31.470 --> 08:36.017
But most of all, we got some
of the top talent in the country.

08:36.225 --> 08:39.645
Oh, it's true, boys.
Most of you were brought in by Batman...

08:39.854 --> 08:43.315
...and the Caped Crusader only deals
with top-echelon talent.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.446
What about The Penguin and the Joker?

08:48.654 --> 08:50.197
They're still in solitary.

08:50.406 --> 08:54.535
They can just cool off there until they find out
who's number one around here.

08:55.202 --> 08:58.247
How do we make sure
Batman won't spoil everything?

08:58.706 --> 09:01.834
Don't you worry about Batman, Catwoman.

09:02.043 --> 09:05.963
Batman and Robin can't hurt us now.
They can only help us.

09:06.172 --> 09:08.049
Help us? How?

09:08.257 --> 09:10.968
Because the dynamic duo
won't bother with us.

09:11.177 --> 09:14.680
- We're already in prison. Ha, ha.
-Ha, ha.

09:14.889 --> 09:16.015
That's right.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.934
All they'll be doing
is rounding up other criminals.

09:19.143 --> 09:22.188
More talent for the Gotham State Pen gang.

09:24.315 --> 09:27.943
Oh, that's beautiful. It's almost poetic.

09:28.152 --> 09:30.362
The harder they work,
the more they'll help us.

09:30.571 --> 09:34.116
So I say, long live Batman and Robin!

09:43.584 --> 09:46.962
Batman, you really think there's
something wrong with the crime computer?

09:47.171 --> 09:50.925
Something's wrong, but I don't know
whether it's the crime computer or me.

09:51.509 --> 09:53.928
But everything worked out swell. Wham!

09:54.136 --> 09:56.263
We got Pretty Boy,
Machine Gun, Mad Dog.

09:56.806 --> 09:58.432
Zap! We got Legs and Ma Parker.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.267
It was the easiest job we ever did.

10:00.476 --> 10:05.397
That's just it, Robin. It was too easy.
Commissioner Gordon said that Ma Parker...

10:05.606 --> 10:08.234
...was the most dangerous adversary
we've ever faced.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.694
Yet she played right into our hands.

10:10.903 --> 10:16.617
I have the strangest feeling
we've been duped.

10:33.592 --> 10:37.388
Big shipment today, Mickey.
Half a million dollars in cash.

10:45.396 --> 10:48.899
All right, you men, let's have that cash!

11:00.578 --> 11:04.832
Our aim's bad enough. Theirs is worse.
Four guns, they can't even hit this truck.

11:06.876 --> 11:10.212
All right, Tiger, give them a bomb.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.929
- What was that?
-The seismograph.

11:20.139 --> 11:21.223
The needle jumped.

11:21.432 --> 11:25.477
- There's an earthquake in Gotham City?
-It didn't register a blast of that intensity.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.730
But it does mean
there's been an explosion...

11:27.938 --> 11:30.733
...in the vicinity
of the Gotham City National Bank.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.153
Back! Get back! Back!

11:34.361 --> 11:36.197
- Back, back. Back.
-Get back. Get back.

11:39.241 --> 11:41.202
- Get back.
-Batman.

11:43.204 --> 11:46.373
- What are we gonna do now, Ma?
<i>- I'll</i> tell you what, let's buy them off.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.293
- Huh?
-Here!

11:49.501 --> 11:50.878
Come on, get out of the way!

11:58.719 --> 12:00.971
Move! Get out of my way!

12:01.805 --> 12:04.975
Citizens, citizens, please. Let us through.

12:08.812 --> 12:13.651
Let us through. This is official business.
Please, citizens, let me by.

12:22.201 --> 12:25.162
- They got away, Batman.
-Yes, thanks to all that interference.

12:25.371 --> 12:27.414
- I wonder who they were.
-I don't know.

12:27.623 --> 12:30.960
But the last one left us a souvenir.

12:33.087 --> 12:36.507
Mm. Just as I thought, Robin.
There's no doubt about it.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.884
Just looks like a piece
of ripped sleeve to me.

12:39.093 --> 12:40.344
Ripped prison cloth.

12:40.552 --> 12:45.182
One of the criminals must be an escaped
convict from the Gotham State Penitentiary.

12:45.391 --> 12:48.894
Holy jailbreak. We haven't heard
of an escaped prisoner, have we?

12:49.103 --> 12:53.524
I suspect there may be a number of things
we haven't heard about.

12:54.275 --> 12:57.861
Let's call Warden Crichton to see
if we can get some additional information.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.863
I wish you'd let me go with you, Ma.

13:00.072 --> 13:02.741
It's dull just being left behind in prison.

13:02.950 --> 13:06.078
Legs, I don't think
it's gonna be dull much longer.

13:07.621 --> 13:08.664
Don't answer it.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.208
Hand me that extension, Machine Gun.

13:11.417 --> 13:12.459
Hello?

13:12.793 --> 13:14.295
This is Batman, Warden Crichton.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.672
Do you know anything
about an escaped prisoner?

13:17.214 --> 13:18.382
Escaped prisoner?

13:18.716 --> 13:20.342
It's that meddling Caped Crusader.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.970
Go tell him to take a bat jump
in Gotham Lake.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.638
Warden Crichton...

13:24.847 --> 13:27.599
-...is <i>there</i> something wrong?
- Yes, there's plenty wrong.

13:27.808 --> 13:30.519
Ma Parker has taken over the prison.
She and her boys--

13:33.522 --> 13:35.274
Warden Crichton!

13:36.066 --> 13:39.611
There's trouble at the penitentiary, Robin,
and Ma Parker must be behind it.

13:39.820 --> 13:42.364
You think she's trying to break out of jail?

13:42.906 --> 13:44.199
I don't know.

13:44.408 --> 13:47.328
But this is time for us to try to break in.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.008
Stand clear.

14:14.355 --> 14:16.482
Hold it. Hold it.

14:16.690 --> 14:20.486
There's easier ways to getting in here,
like robbing a bank.

14:20.694 --> 14:24.573
- We'd hoped our arrival would go unnoticed.
-Yeah, well, I noticed it.

14:24.782 --> 14:27.785
I guess I'm gonna have to shoot you,
both of you.

14:28.327 --> 14:30.245
Instructions from Ma Parker?

14:30.454 --> 14:32.831
Yeah, she left orders.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.627
She said anyone can get out,
but no one can get in.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.754
Sorry.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.383
- What a shame, Left.
-What do you mean?

14:42.591 --> 14:45.386
- Jeopardizing your entire future?
-Jeopardizing?

14:45.594 --> 14:48.347
Only 48 more years before your parole.

14:51.975 --> 14:55.396
Gee, I never thought of that.

14:55.604 --> 15:00.317
Forty-eight more years and I'm a free man.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.027
<i>BOY-</i>

15:02.986 --> 15:05.114
A wise decision.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.574
You won't regret this, citizen.

15:12.079 --> 15:15.874
- We've gotten this far, now what?
-Try to cross the yard without being spotted.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.668
You've been spotted, Batman.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.795
Hello, Kelly. Nice to see you.

15:20.003 --> 15:22.506
Warden Crichton tells me
you're doing a fine job.

15:22.714 --> 15:23.882
He does?

15:24.091 --> 15:25.884
Well, welcome to the pen.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.095
Let's take them to Ma.

15:34.810 --> 15:37.062
Here you are, Ma, a present.

15:37.271 --> 15:39.440
Well, well, well.

15:39.648 --> 15:43.485
At last, Batman and Robin in my power.

15:43.694 --> 15:48.240
Boys, I think the dynamic duo
look hungry and tired.

15:48.449 --> 15:53.078
Let's give them a good supper
and then find them a comfortable chair.

16:04.882 --> 16:08.093
- You feeling nice and comfortable, Batman?
-Very.

16:08.302 --> 16:11.305
The dinner was excellent.
My compliments to the chef.

16:11.513 --> 16:14.349
And I do appreciate your not rushing us.

16:14.558 --> 16:17.811
Well, I also have some time to kill.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.901
Until midnight, you mean?

16:24.109 --> 16:26.320
You savvy, Batman.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.780
Why midnight, Ma? Why not right now?

16:28.989 --> 16:32.117
Mad Dog, Gotham City will be sound asleep
by midnight...

16:32.326 --> 16:35.370
...and nobody will notice
the extra drain on the power.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.083
Mama always knows best.

16:41.919 --> 16:43.837
Be careful of those straps, fellas.

16:44.171 --> 16:47.674
They're connected to the electrical circuit.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.052
Let's get going. boys-

16:50.260 --> 16:53.680
There's a couple of last-minute odds and ends
I gotta attend to.

16:53.889 --> 16:55.974
Legs, you stay here.

16:56.183 --> 16:59.102
Even a girl ought to be able
to watch those two now.

17:05.526 --> 17:07.277
Holy rheostat. Look at the time.

17:08.237 --> 17:09.279
I know, Robin.

17:09.820 --> 17:13.325
He who hath life hath time.

17:13.534 --> 17:15.285
A proverb worth remembering.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.961
Legs?

17:25.837 --> 17:29.424
What's a nice girl like you doing
in a situation like this?

17:29.758 --> 17:33.804
I'm as good as any boy,
even if Ma doesn't think so.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.515
It does seem a little unfair.

17:36.723 --> 17:41.645
Girls are more sensitive, have more brain.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.522
You can say that again.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.692
And you weren't fooled for a minute,
were you?

17:46.900 --> 17:50.612
When Ma left you here with us
even though we can't get away?

17:51.405 --> 17:52.906
Wasn't I?

17:53.115 --> 17:54.616
L-- I mean, did she?

17:54.825 --> 17:55.909
Well, why?

17:56.326 --> 17:59.037
I have a suspicion, Legs...

17:59.246 --> 18:05.586
...that Ma and the boys
have something else cooking.

18:05.794 --> 18:09.840
Something they maybe didn't want you
to know about.

18:10.048 --> 18:14.636
Well, they can't pull that one over on me.

18:16.638 --> 18:17.723
What's that all about?

18:17.931 --> 18:21.518
A psychological experiment, Robin,
and it worked.

18:21.727 --> 18:24.438
Now, if I can just break this wire...

18:24.646 --> 18:29.693
...and make contact with the Transistorized
Shortwave Bat-transmitter in my Utility Belt.

18:29.901 --> 18:32.487
But that only connects to the receiver
in the Batcave.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.156
That's right, Robin.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.700
If I can just send a signal to Alfred.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.119
We don't have any power source.

18:39.453 --> 18:42.497
The power is in this chair itself.

18:42.706 --> 18:46.376
If I can just break this wire loose.

18:56.470 --> 18:59.264
Now, to send a message in bat-code.

19:16.114 --> 19:19.117
Ahem. Yes, Madam?

19:19.326 --> 19:25.040
Alfred, I know Bruce's study
is his private domain, but those sounds...

19:25.248 --> 19:27.876
He's having some work done
on the wiring, madam.

19:28.085 --> 19:30.921
- A new television unit, I believe.
-Oh.

19:31.713 --> 19:37.177
Well, don't tell him I was curious,
will you, Alfred?

20:09.084 --> 20:11.378
You think you got through, Batman?

20:12.087 --> 20:13.588
I don't know, Robin.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.465
Oh, now look at the time.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.764
It's almost midnight, Ma.

20:22.973 --> 20:26.143
I know, Mad Dog.
You let your mother handle this.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.103
- Oh, no, Ma, I wanna do it.
-No, me.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.730
- No way.
-Quiet!

20:29.938 --> 20:31.356
Quiet, quiet!

20:31.565 --> 20:35.444
Ma Parker, I don't care about myself.

20:35.652 --> 20:38.697
But in the name of decency,
I ask you to spare the life of Robin.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.241
Very, very touching.

20:50.834 --> 20:53.128
Something must've gone wrong
with the electricity.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.672
- I guess the power failed.
-I can't see, Ma.

20:55.881 --> 20:58.717
All right. Why don't you light a match?

20:59.092 --> 21:02.596
- Here you are, Ma.
-Batman's loose!

21:16.860 --> 21:18.820
Get him, get him.

21:37.088 --> 21:39.841
- Are you all right, Robin?
-I've never felt better, Batman.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.761
I noticed
an emergency generator switch here--

21:42.969 --> 21:44.763
Yes, there it is.

21:47.766 --> 21:51.019
Wow, these infrared eyeglasses
really worked, Batman.

21:51.228 --> 21:54.940
- I could see perfectly in the dark.
-Yes, they came in handy.

21:55.148 --> 21:59.236
- I still don't understand what happened.
-Simple. The message I gave to Alfred...

21:59.444 --> 22:03.240
...was have Gotham City Electric Company
shut off the power at precisely midnight.

22:03.907 --> 22:08.662
Holy Edison. You're a wiz, Batman. But
what about all the loose convicts out there?

22:08.870 --> 22:12.582
Snug in their cells.
The doors open and close electrically.

22:12.791 --> 22:16.670
When the power was shut off,
they were locked in.

22:22.884 --> 22:26.513
Well, Ma,
I hope you've learned your lesson at last.

22:27.138 --> 22:29.975
Have pity, Batman, on a poor mother.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.519
I didn't mean any harm.

22:32.727 --> 22:35.730
I was just trying to make my children happy.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.858
Look out, Batman!

22:38.817 --> 22:40.360
Looking for this, Ma?

22:40.694 --> 22:44.573
I took the precaution of removing it
from your hair during the fight.

22:44.906 --> 22:47.534
You're very clever, Batman.

22:47.742 --> 22:51.997
It isn't easy
to foil the greatest mother of them all.

22:59.254 --> 23:02.007
Once again we're in your debt,
Caped Crusaders.

23:02.215 --> 23:06.511
Just doing our job, commissioner,
and with some reluctance.

23:06.720 --> 23:11.683
Committing a mother and her four children
to prison is not a pleasant assignment.

23:11.892 --> 23:13.268
Even Ma Parker.

23:13.476 --> 23:17.147
Anyway, you'd better make sure that she
and her progeny are safely tucked away.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.566
For some time to come, Batman.

23:22.694 --> 23:25.322
- What's that, warden?
-No need for alarm, Batman.

23:25.530 --> 23:27.407
That's merely the call
to Sunday chapel service.

23:27.616 --> 23:28.783
Oh.

23:31.286 --> 23:33.038
Excuse me, warden.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.497
Yes, what is it, Riley?

23:34.706 --> 23:38.543
This package just arrived for Ma Parker.
I thought you'd better see it first.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.755
Careful, warden, you know her tricks.

23:41.963 --> 23:45.300
Yes. It might be some more dynamite.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.594
Let me see that, warden.

23:50.513 --> 23:54.351
It was ordered on your telephone, warden,
by her four children...

23:54.559 --> 23:56.436
...when they had control of the prison.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.231
Easy, Batman.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.652
I don't think there's any danger, Robin.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.700
Flowers, gentlemen.

24:10.909 --> 24:12.661
Do you know what day this is?

24:12.869 --> 24:16.122
- What day?
-Mother's Day.
