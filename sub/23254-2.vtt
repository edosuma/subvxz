00:21.200 --> 00:24.960
<i> Things didn't always go entirely</i>
<i>to plan on my journey with Alyssa.</i>

00:25.160 --> 00:26.880
Do you think it's gonna explode?

00:27.200 --> 00:28.760
It's not a film.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.800
<i> If this was a film,</i>
<i>we'd probably be American.</i>

00:41.200 --> 00:42.760
Whoo!

00:43.360 --> 00:45.080
Yeah!

00:45.160 --> 00:48.280
<i> I kept wondering what sort</i>
<i>of sound she'd make when I killed her.</i>

00:54.920 --> 00:56.560
<i>I needed to find somewhere quiet.</i>

00:58.280 --> 01:00.440
Guess what freedom smells like?

01:00.920 --> 01:02.880
-Cow shit.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.400
-Seat belt.
-Fuck seat belts.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.040
So what do you wanna do?

01:12.560 --> 01:13.600
I dunno.

01:14.280 --> 01:18.040
Because we can literally do anything,
James.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.120
Anything we want.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.720
Gun! Gun! Gun!

01:29.760 --> 01:32.080
<i> Ironically,</i>
<i>I was not in my element.</i>

01:38.480 --> 01:39.800
Come on!

01:41.080 --> 01:42.560
This is shit!

01:44.440 --> 01:48.040
<i> Sometimes, I look at him</i>
<i>and I think, "Are you a bit dead?"</i>

01:49.400 --> 01:50.680
Put your tongue in my ear.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.600
-I like it.

02:01.880 --> 02:04.120
<i> Right, stop that now.</i>

02:07.400 --> 02:08.240
Sorry.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.919
<i> Alyssa was really good</i>
<i>at annoying people.</i>

02:12.720 --> 02:14.920
Thank God I smashed my phone.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.840
I bet my mum's been calling nonstop.
Stupid bitch.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.440
How long till your dad calls the police?

02:22.520 --> 02:23.600
What?

02:24.280 --> 02:25.120
About the car. He won't.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.200
-Yeah.

02:29.920 --> 02:31.560
He'll think I'm coming home soon.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.920
And he's a prick and everything,
but he's pretty optimistic.

02:41.120 --> 02:41.960
What?

02:43.280 --> 02:44.240
What?

02:45.800 --> 02:47.040
I like food.

02:47.720 --> 02:48.600
OK.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.240
<i> My mum says</i>
<i>that if food were her boyfriend,</i>

02:51.320 --> 02:53.160
<i>she'd be in an abusive relationship.</i>

02:54.040 --> 02:56.600
<i>She says it like it's a joke,</i>
<i>but it's not.</i>

02:59.040 --> 03:00.000
What?

03:10.280 --> 03:11.880
Did you bring money with you?

03:12.520 --> 03:13.360
Didn't you?

03:13.440 --> 03:15.680
Yeah. I just spent it at Laserkill.

03:16.680 --> 03:17.640
That was all your money.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.240
I didn't have to pay for you.
I was being fucking polite, actually.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.680
What are we going to do?

03:25.520 --> 03:27.520
Well, it's just food.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.440
And we haven't eaten all of it.
You haven't.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.600
The only rule with these things

03:34.680 --> 03:37.640
is that you never steal from a small
or independent business.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.440
-My dad's.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.880
He's basically Robin Hood.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.880
He breaks the law,
but he's really moral.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.360
"If it's a chain, it's free rein."

03:47.560 --> 03:50.080
-Say it.
-"If it's a chain, it's free rein."

03:50.160 --> 03:53.480
There you go. Otherwise,
you're basically funding terrorism.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.720
-Places like this are all run by the Man.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.040
"The Man" man.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.400
The Man who, you know, owns all the oil,

04:02.480 --> 04:05.960
forces Chinese children
to make smartphones and hates Palestine.

04:08.520 --> 04:09.920
Are you gonna be a pussy?

04:11.280 --> 04:13.960
<i> Showing willing was</i>
<i>the best approach with Alyssa.</i>

04:14.040 --> 04:14.960
No.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.200
<i> Shit.</i>

04:29.240 --> 04:30.840
Nice one.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.480
-Seat belt!
-Fuck seat belts.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.800
<i> I had her</i>
<i>right where I wanted her.</i>

04:39.040 --> 04:40.360
We should have sex.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.760
-Yeah.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.920
Take your top off.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.920
Erm, OK...

04:50.000 --> 04:51.600
<i> I had to go along with it.</i>

04:52.400 --> 04:53.280
Should...

04:53.360 --> 04:55.360
-No.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.840
Keep driving.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.200
<i> But I wasn't sure sex was</i>
<i>something you could just go along with,</i>

05:01.280 --> 05:03.240
<i>especially not as a man.</i>

05:03.320 --> 05:04.920
It's OK for women.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.400
They can just lie back,
think of England.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.680
Us men, we have to be England.

05:10.760 --> 05:12.680
Stop! I think I'm stuck.

05:20.680 --> 05:21.680
Shit.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.920
Why are you laughing?

05:26.720 --> 05:28.240
My dad loves this car.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.080
It's the most expensive thing
he's ever bought.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.880
<i> What the fuck</i>
<i>are we gonna do now?</i>

05:43.040 --> 05:44.760
Do you think it's gonna explode?

05:44.960 --> 05:46.320
It's not a film.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.160
Come on.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.600
I might be able to fix it.
We can't just leave it.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.280
Do you reckon you can still fix it?

06:09.280 --> 06:10.320
What should we do<i> Go home.</i>

06:12.400 --> 06:13.320
Do you wanna go home?

06:13.840 --> 06:16.560
<i> Hang on.</i>
<i>Does he want to go home?</i>

06:16.640 --> 06:17.800
You saying you wanna go home?

06:18.920 --> 06:20.760
'Cause that's fine, can if you want.

06:20.840 --> 06:24.400
-No, I don't want to. I was just asking...
-I don't wanna go home, James.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.320
-But...
-I don't want to go home.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.120
-I don't know!

06:34.200 --> 06:36.920
Why don't you fucking think
of something for once?

06:39.440 --> 06:40.920
<i> I couldn't have done it there.</i>

06:41.000 --> 06:42.920
<i>The car would've linked me to the crime.</i>

06:51.960 --> 06:54.320

07:26.960 --> 07:28.760
Why is no one stopping?

07:28.840 --> 07:31.480
Probably
because you've got your tits out.

07:32.040 --> 07:35.240
I'm serious. No one stops for weirdos
except other weirdos.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.880
And you look like a proper day release.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.160
You all right?

07:54.680 --> 07:55.680
Hi.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.120
I'm heading down south, son,
if it's any good to you.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.280
Do you want a lift or not?

08:07.600 --> 08:08.760
Yeah. Thanks.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.560
Come on, then.

08:11.960 --> 08:12.800
Come on.

08:14.520 --> 08:15.480
Come on!

08:21.120 --> 08:24.120
I am gonna be so fucked off
if we get murdered.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.920
<i> I can't believe</i>
<i>he got in the front.</i>

08:40.480 --> 08:44.040
Grab us that sweater in the back, there,
love. Chuck it down to your boyfriend.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.920
Who said he's my boyfriend?

08:48.160 --> 08:50.240
<i> Alyssa was starting</i>
<i>to test my patience.</i>

08:53.280 --> 08:54.240
Are you all right, love?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.520
Is she all right, son?

08:57.600 --> 08:58.560
She's fine.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.080
You're funny, you. I like you.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.840
-Nearly, I'm buying her.

09:08.560 --> 09:10.760
-Yeah.

09:11.280 --> 09:12.920
Not for long, mind.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.960
She's a cane corso.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.360
What's that?

09:17.440 --> 09:20.680
Number 23 on the Top 25
Most Dangerous Dog List.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.000
For fighting.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.560
-Just a bit.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.920
You know your car smells like feet.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.600
One of the lads had a couple,
in Fallujah.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.440
-They're lethal, I tell ya.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.720
Five year.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.040
Cool.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.960
So tell me, then,
what you two been up to, eh?

09:48.280 --> 09:51.000
Come on, I ain't gonna say anything.
What's the matter with ya?

09:51.080 --> 09:52.440
Well, we haven't done anything.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.520
Sure.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.920
I couldn't give a fuck either way, I'm...

09:57.520 --> 10:00.720
I'm just making conversation, you know?
I'm not a fucking copper.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.000
I just thought, you know, you...

10:05.160 --> 10:07.960
You might wanna make
a phone call to your mum or something.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.200
Let her know you're OK.

10:09.760 --> 10:10.840
My mum's dead, actually.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.640
I thought you said your mum was
in Japan?

10:25.920 --> 10:26.960
So?

10:27.040 --> 10:29.600
So it's a bit different
from being dead, isn't it?

10:33.520 --> 10:34.600
This guy's a prick.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.720
What?

10:35.800 --> 10:39.000
He's, like,
the worst kind of person.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.160
He's all right.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.880
Why are you defending him?
He's a murderer.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.920
-He was in the army.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.560
He's murdered people.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.240
And now he's buying a dog
to murder other dogs with.

10:52.160 --> 10:53.400
Here you go.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.520
Thanks.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.200
Yeah. Is that your family?

11:07.480 --> 11:08.960
That's the missus, Liz.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.320
Abi.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.800
That's Baby Jack.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.120
Jack looks like a potato.

11:16.640 --> 11:17.800
You what, love?

11:17.960 --> 11:19.160
Joke!

11:19.240 --> 11:20.360
Joking.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.400
He looks like a ham.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.360
He does, though, doesn't he?

11:30.560 --> 11:31.440
No.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.040
You guys are so fucking boring.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.240
Sorry.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.800
Don't be daft, son.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.520
She's a bit full The bird.

11:54.160 --> 11:57.280
Oh... Yeah, she can be.

11:57.960 --> 11:59.000
Well...

12:00.040 --> 12:01.040
That's women, eh? Yeah.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.400
Maybe.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.080
What was it like?

12:11.720 --> 12:12.800
In the army.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.400
Ah, it was all right, you know.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.560
Did you kill people?

12:18.680 --> 12:20.200
It's part of the job, son.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.080
How many?

12:23.760 --> 12:26.520
Well, be a bit sick
to keep count, wouldn't it?

12:27.040 --> 12:29.000
<i> I'd have definitely kept count.</i>

12:30.560 --> 12:32.440
-I'm gonna go to the...
-Oh, yeah, sure.

12:32.520 --> 12:33.800
-toilet.
-Sure, sure.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.360
I say, son.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.200
I might as well join you.
Put one in the bag, you know.

12:46.720 --> 12:49.080
<i> I'm bad</i>
<i>at apologizing to people,</i>

12:49.720 --> 12:51.520
<i>but sometimes I know I should.</i>

13:05.600 --> 13:07.080
What happened to your hand?

13:21.280 --> 13:22.720
<i> Sometimes, I just...</i>

13:22.800 --> 13:24.440
<i>let things happen.</i>

13:26.600 --> 13:28.440
<i>Even though I didn't want them to.</i>

13:32.040 --> 13:33.320
<i>I'm not sure why.</i>

13:41.440 --> 13:42.280
What's going on?

13:46.160 --> 13:47.080
Are you gay?

13:47.560 --> 13:48.400
No.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.520
-It's OK if you are.
-I'm not.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.080
-But you should tell me if you are.
-I'm not gay.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.440
So what are you doing?

13:55.440 --> 13:57.080
Where do you think you're going?

13:58.080 --> 14:00.040
Well, I... gotta go.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.400
The dog's not gonna collect herself,
now is she?

14:02.960 --> 14:03.840
Gimme your wallet.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.640
You what?

14:05.720 --> 14:06.880
Give me your wallet.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.720
No. No...

14:10.800 --> 14:13.200
Give me your wallet or I swear to fuck

14:13.280 --> 14:15.840
I'll go visit Liz and Abi
and your weird potato baby,

14:15.920 --> 14:19.240
and tell them what you like to do
with teenage boys in toilets.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.640
You wouldn't do that.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.800
I'll tell the police, too.

14:45.440 --> 14:46.920
He put my hand there.

14:49.560 --> 14:52.880
You know that if people wanna do stuff
to you, you don't have to let them.

14:52.960 --> 14:53.880
Yeah.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.200
Do you?

14:56.960 --> 14:57.800
Yeah.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.720
So why did you?

15:03.160 --> 15:05.440
Did something bad happen to you
when you were small?

15:10.760 --> 15:11.600
No.

15:16.600 --> 15:17.800
I'm tired.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.800
-Yup.

15:35.880 --> 15:39.000
A double room with a double bed
for double sex.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.560
<i> I really need to cry.</i>

16:02.200 --> 16:04.640
-OK.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.760
Find some porn.
