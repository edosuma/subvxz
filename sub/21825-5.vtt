WEBVTT

00:04.772 --> 00:07.875
(rhythmic beeping and whooshing)

00:07.908 --> 00:09.244
JERRY:
Where'd you get those?

00:09.277 --> 00:10.245
KRAMER: The machine.
You want one?

00:10.278 --> 00:12.079
No.
Here.

00:12.112 --> 00:13.748
KRAMER: Take one. JERRY:
I don't want one.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.316
No. They're good. Take one.
I don't want any.

00:15.350 --> 00:16.584
KRAMER: Just take one. No, stop.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.853
Kramer, stop it!

00:18.886 --> 00:21.121
(canned laughter on screen)

00:23.057 --> 00:25.760
(laughter)

00:25.793 --> 00:29.830
(snort, laughter)

00:29.864 --> 00:32.367
I do not understand
the source of your amusement.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.168
'Cause it's funny, man!

00:34.201 --> 00:37.037
It is my understanding
that such a surgical procedure

00:37.071 --> 00:40.207
was a delicate, high-risk
undertaking at the time.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.409
Yeah, that's
why it's funny!

00:41.442 --> 00:43.878
But could not the entry
of a confection

00:43.911 --> 00:46.247
into the exposed internal
biology potentially put

00:46.281 --> 00:48.115
the patient's life in danger?

00:48.148 --> 00:50.251
You know, when you asked us
to explain comedy to you,

00:50.285 --> 00:52.620
I didn't think you were gonna
try to ruin everything good.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.689
But to derive mirth
from the pain of another being

00:54.722 --> 00:56.257
is sadism, is it not?

00:56.291 --> 00:58.359
ED: I mean, it's
case by case.

00:58.393 --> 01:00.461
Like, if a guy
on a bike tries to do a trick,

01:00.495 --> 01:02.597
and he smashes his balls,
that's funny.

01:02.630 --> 01:06.100
I would agree. Okay, here's
a better example, Isaac.

01:06.133 --> 01:08.035
Have you ever heard
of a practical joke?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.904
I am unfamiliar with the term.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.106
Okay. Well, I'm
gonna show you.

01:12.139 --> 01:13.308
(alarm beeping) ALARA: Captain,

01:13.341 --> 01:15.209
we're receiving
a priority one distress signal

01:15.242 --> 01:17.278
from the Gatria star system.

01:17.312 --> 01:18.413
That's right
in our neighborhood.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.415
Set course
and engage quantum drive.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.082
Aye, sir.
(trilling)

01:44.204 --> 01:46.073
Looks like a
sun diver.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.141
A what?

01:47.174 --> 01:48.409
KELLY:
A comet that got caught

01:48.443 --> 01:49.744
in the gravitational
pull of a star.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.312
It basically makes
a kamikaze dive

01:51.346 --> 01:53.180
until it's vaporized
by the heat.

01:53.213 --> 01:54.482
ALARA:
Captain,

01:54.515 --> 01:55.916
the signal's coming

01:55.950 --> 01:57.251
from the surface of the comet.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.620
It's a crashed ship.
What?

01:59.654 --> 02:02.122
Isolate the frequency
and patch me in.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.991
You're on, sir.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.794
Unidentified vessel,
this is the U.S.S. Orville.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.162
Do you read me?
(static)

02:08.195 --> 02:09.697
This is Captain Pria Lavesque

02:09.730 --> 02:11.699
of the mining ship Horizon.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.168
(explosion)
I'm in trouble.

02:14.201 --> 02:17.872
(explosions)

02:21.642 --> 02:23.644
â™ª

03:29.644 --> 03:31.078
Captain Lavesque, stand by.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.179
We're gonna get you
out of there.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.514
How's your life support?

03:33.548 --> 03:34.882
It's functioning,

03:34.915 --> 03:36.216
but it's getting
pretty hot in here.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.252
Isaac,
what about a tractor beam?

03:38.285 --> 03:40.855
The vessel is partially embedded
in the surface of the comet.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.858
The tractor beam could
compromise its hull integrity.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.526
What if someone pilots a shuttle
to the surface?

03:45.560 --> 03:47.361
ISAAC: The rescue would
need to be completed

03:47.394 --> 03:49.764
before the comet gets
too close to the star,

03:49.797 --> 03:51.365
or the shuttle
will be unable

03:51.398 --> 03:53.067
to escape
its gravity.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.869
Captain, respectfully submit
that the attractiveness

03:54.902 --> 03:56.871
of the ship's occupant
makes the rescue imperative.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.906
I could do it. ISAAC:
The star's gravity

03:58.939 --> 04:00.641
will cause the comet
to break apart

04:00.675 --> 04:02.577
in seven minutes, 23 seconds.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.745
You could do it. All
right, let's move fast.

04:04.779 --> 04:08.716
Gordon, Alara, you're with me.
Ed.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.951
Be careful.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.439
Scans show the ship is near
the apex of the comet.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.642
Why do I have a bad
feeling about this?

04:34.675 --> 04:37.645
You got this, right?
Yeah.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.313
Why'd your voice just get
so high-pitched? Huh?

04:39.346 --> 04:42.116
Your voice just got really
high-pitched just then. No, it didn't.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.118
Yeah, it did. You were like
"Yeah." No, it's all good.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.586
Well, then what was
the high-pitch...

04:45.620 --> 04:48.489
(in deep voice):
It's fine. I got this.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.132
Damn, that thing took a beating.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.639
(mechanical chirping)

05:11.011 --> 05:13.180
We got two minutes. Let's go.

05:16.651 --> 05:19.554
(electrical hissing, rumbling)

05:19.587 --> 05:22.523
(groaning)

05:22.557 --> 05:24.992
Alara, you want to open
this jar of pickles?

05:33.267 --> 05:35.536
Hey! Easy with the merchandise!

05:35.570 --> 05:38.573
The merchandise is about
to be vaporized. Come on!

05:43.510 --> 05:45.646
Mercer to Orville!
How much time do we have?

05:45.680 --> 05:49.016
11 seconds.
Ed, hurry!

05:49.049 --> 05:50.250
Strap in, you guys.

05:50.284 --> 05:52.286
We're sealed.
Here we go.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.103
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.705
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no!

06:10.738 --> 06:11.939
Come on! Come on!

06:11.972 --> 06:13.440
What is it?

06:13.473 --> 06:15.275
It's the gravity from the star!
It's pulling us in!

06:16.644 --> 06:19.113
(yelling)

06:19.146 --> 06:21.849
Mercer to Orville. Lock onto
us with the tractor beam.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.751
Lamarr, lock onto them!
Locking on.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.097
Got 'em! Bringin' 'em back.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.344
Nice work, John.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.221
(trilling)

07:01.255 --> 07:04.324
What the hell were you doing
trying to land on a comet?

07:04.358 --> 07:06.160
Oh. I was returning
from a mining expedition

07:06.193 --> 07:07.494
in the Matar system,

07:07.527 --> 07:10.064
and I encountered a
Krill battle cruiser.

07:10.097 --> 07:13.267
I managed to outrun it,
but it drained my power.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.671
My sensors detected a dysonium
deposit inside the comet.

07:16.704 --> 07:19.239
So, it was either
try and land there

07:19.273 --> 07:22.910
and get the fuel that I needed,
or sit around and wait to die.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.245
Well, lucky for you, we happened
to be in your neck of the woods.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.815
Extremely lucky.
Thank you, Captain.

07:27.848 --> 07:30.350
Well, you're welcome, Captain.
Alara will assign you

07:30.384 --> 07:32.186
temporary quarters
until we can drop you off

07:32.219 --> 07:34.588
at the nearest Union base.
Perfect.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.624
Deck C quarters, unit three?
Yeah. Wait.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.126
Didn't the last guy in
there have a hamster?

07:39.159 --> 07:40.761
Lieutenant Phillips, yeah.

07:40.795 --> 07:42.296
Does it still
smell like hamster?

07:42.329 --> 07:45.165
I'll give her unit six.
Great.

07:45.199 --> 07:49.203
Well, insane day for you, huh?
Yeah. You know,

07:49.236 --> 07:51.806
I'm not ashamed to admit
I could use a drink.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.174
Well, you know,
I'm hosting a cocktail thing

07:54.208 --> 07:56.176
for the senior officers tonight
in my quarters.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.679
You're welcome to join.
I'd love to.

07:58.713 --> 08:00.815
Great.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.190
(sighs)

08:10.224 --> 08:12.226
Oh, it's almost 1800 hours.
I'm gonna go get ready.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.460
Okay, I'll
see you there.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.295
GORDON:
Oh, wait. Captain?

08:15.329 --> 08:18.298
You mind stickin' around for a few minutes?
Why? What for?

08:18.332 --> 08:20.835
I think everyone's
gonna want to see this.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.337
See what?
(stifles a laugh)

08:35.916 --> 08:39.186
(muffled laughter) Is there some
reason I am the central focus

08:39.219 --> 08:40.855
of everyone's attention?

08:40.888 --> 08:43.758
Well, you look happier
than usual.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.894
Happiness is not possible
for an artificial life form.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.428
You have a face.

08:48.462 --> 08:50.397
I do not understand.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.999
Isaac, are you aware

08:52.032 --> 08:53.567
that you have Mr. Potato Head
pieces all over you?

08:53.600 --> 08:56.070
(Gordon laughs)

08:56.103 --> 09:00.240
I got you, man!
I totally got you!

09:00.274 --> 09:01.876
See, that's a
practical joke!

09:01.909 --> 09:04.178
Wait. You put that stuff on him?
Yeah.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.679
While he was recharging.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.182
How the hell can you even see
with all of that stuff on?

09:08.215 --> 09:11.952
I detect environmental stimuli
with internal sensors.

09:11.986 --> 09:14.254
My eyes are
purely aesthetic.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.256
Evidently,
my sensors did not classify

09:16.290 --> 09:18.926
these "Mr. Potato Head pieces"
as a threat.

09:18.959 --> 09:22.229
Okay, okay, so, now
it's your turn, okay?

09:22.262 --> 09:23.297
You got to get me.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.865
And you got to be creative.

09:24.899 --> 09:26.100
You got to do it when
I least expect it.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.936
And this is... humor?
Yes!

09:28.969 --> 09:31.571
I must admit, it is
quite challenging.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.307
However, I will do my best.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.276
(laughs)

09:36.310 --> 09:38.312
("Penthouse Serenade"
by Erroll Garner playing)

09:49.123 --> 09:51.491
Oh, well, the mining company
keeps things from getting dull,

09:51.525 --> 09:53.293
I can tell you that.

09:53.327 --> 09:56.330
The Vega Consortium operates out
by the frontier, doesn't it?

09:56.363 --> 09:59.934
Yes. Oh, you meet some pretty
wild cultures out there.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.736
Last year, I was trying to
secure mining rights on a planet

10:02.769 --> 10:04.304
where it's customary
at the start

10:04.338 --> 10:05.739
of any business negotiation

10:05.772 --> 10:07.507
for all parties
to show their genitals.

10:07.541 --> 10:09.143
What's the point of that?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.144
It's a show of good faith,

10:10.177 --> 10:11.445
a promise that

10:11.478 --> 10:13.080
all negotiators
will be forthright

10:13.113 --> 10:14.514
and free from deception.

10:14.548 --> 10:16.316
Well, if you're a miner, I guess

10:16.350 --> 10:19.019
that's what you call
"finding a vein."

10:20.520 --> 10:22.923
(Pria clears
her throat)

10:22.957 --> 10:25.125
KELLY: So, Captain Lavesque,
where are you from originally?

10:25.159 --> 10:26.961
PRIA: Uh, I was
born on Earth.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.296
Massachusetts, actually.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.464
No kidding?
I'm from Massachusetts.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.132
Really? What part?

10:32.166 --> 10:33.868
Little town called Boxford.
I'm from Andover.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.302
Oh, my God,
we were neighbors.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.470
Did you ever go

10:36.503 --> 10:37.804
to the Salem Witch
Museum as a kid?

10:37.838 --> 10:39.306
My mother took me there
when I was ten.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.674
It scared
the crap out of me.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.142
That holographic
recreation

10:42.176 --> 10:43.878
of the Giles Corey
interrogation?

10:43.911 --> 10:45.779
Yes, where they kept putting the
rocks on top of him to get him

10:45.812 --> 10:48.682
to confess, and he was going,
"More weight!" "More weight!"

10:48.715 --> 10:51.718
I had nightmares for a month. I
don't think you ever told me that.

10:51.751 --> 10:54.054
It's, like, this weird, specific
thing. You kind of just had

10:54.088 --> 10:56.523
to be there, but, God, it's
so crazy that you would bring

10:56.556 --> 10:58.225
that up. PRIA: It's crazy.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.826
Man, I haven't thought
about that in years.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.196
(Ed and Pria laugh)

11:02.229 --> 11:04.231
â™ª

11:05.699 --> 11:07.001
(door chimes)

11:07.034 --> 11:09.269
Come in!

11:10.337 --> 11:11.638
Hi. Me again.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.973
Captain Lavesque.

11:13.007 --> 11:14.541
Hi.
Oh, please,

11:14.574 --> 11:16.143
you can call me Pria.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.213
Pria. Um, I hope
you had fun tonight.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.981
I did. I had
a lot of fun.

11:21.015 --> 11:22.816
Good, good,
good. Um...

11:22.849 --> 11:24.818
we still have some,
uh, orange...

11:24.851 --> 11:27.854
(stammers) fl-flooflers. I
don't know what they are, but...

11:27.888 --> 11:29.156
I'm vegetarian.
They're terrible.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.424
Forget it.
(chuckles)

11:30.457 --> 11:33.060
Listen, I realized
I never said a proper thank-you.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.662
You know, I would've
been cooked alive today

11:35.695 --> 11:37.431
if it hadn't been
for you and your crew.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.233
Well, that's our job.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.168
Uh, how are
your quarters?

11:41.201 --> 11:44.004
Doesn't smell like hamster.
That's great. That's gr...

11:44.038 --> 11:46.240
That's-that's a big
win around here. Um,

11:46.273 --> 11:48.242
well, please don't steal our
towels. We've had some problems.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.843
(laughs)

11:49.876 --> 11:51.578
Okay. I won't.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.948
Um...

11:53.981 --> 11:56.350
I'm gonna turn in.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.953
Okay.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.394
Thank you.

12:09.263 --> 12:11.465
(door whooshes shut)

12:24.078 --> 12:26.080
â™ª

12:41.095 --> 12:44.231
Search personnel database
for the Vega Mining Consortium.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.133
Name: Pria Lavesque.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.834
COMPUTER:
Search complete.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.669
No results.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.440
(door whooshes open)

12:54.441 --> 12:57.477
And this is our engine room.

12:57.511 --> 13:00.180
We have a dysonium-powered
quantum drive system

13:00.214 --> 13:03.017
capable of speeds exceeding
ten light-years per hour.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.184
That's impressive.
Yeah.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.419
Chief.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.187
This is Captain
Lavesque.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.622
And th some.

13:08.655 --> 13:09.756
(chuckles)

13:09.789 --> 13:12.426
Uh-oh. Callin' HR.
(chuckles)

13:12.459 --> 13:13.527
I'm just kidding.
Steve Newton.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.828
Glad to know you.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.330
Nice to meet you.
YAPHIT: Hey, Chief,

13:16.363 --> 13:17.597
the recalibration's gonna...

13:17.631 --> 13:19.333
Yowza!

13:19.366 --> 13:21.501
And this is Yaphit.
Hi, Yaphit.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.270
Hi right back at ya.
(chuckles)

13:23.303 --> 13:25.339
You know, this may sound
blunt, but you are

13:25.372 --> 13:27.441
the only white woman
I've ever found attractive.

13:27.474 --> 13:31.145
Well, you're the handsomest
pile of cat puke I've ever seen.

13:31.178 --> 13:31.711
(laughs)

13:31.745 --> 13:32.779
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

13:32.812 --> 13:35.115
I love this gal!

13:35.149 --> 13:37.184
Ed? Could I talk to you
for a second?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.319
Yeah, sure. Uh,
why don't you guys

13:39.353 --> 13:40.854
show Pria
the engine core?

13:43.557 --> 13:45.825
What's up?

13:45.859 --> 13:47.961
This is a current
personnel manifest

13:47.994 --> 13:49.696
of the Vega Mining Consortium.

13:49.729 --> 13:52.132
There's no record at all
of a Pria Lavesque.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.734
Well, mining consortiums
have employees coming and going

13:54.768 --> 13:56.636
all the time-- their records
are usually sloppy.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.238
It's probably
just an oversight.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.340
She said she's been there
at least a year.

14:00.374 --> 14:02.409
Why are you so worried about her?
I'm your first officer.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.843
It's my job to worry.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.879
And as your first officer,
I would advise you

14:05.912 --> 14:08.415
not to give her this kind
of access to our systems

14:08.448 --> 14:11.085
until we can confirm her identity.
My God, what are we,

14:11.118 --> 14:12.886
the Inquisition here?
She's done nothing wrong.

14:12.919 --> 14:15.655
I just... I want Alara
to assign someone to her.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.224
Just to be safe.
Oh, my God,

14:17.257 --> 14:18.225
Kelly, no, no.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.359
Listen, I will ask her

14:19.393 --> 14:20.860
about the personnel manifest.

14:20.894 --> 14:23.397
Okay? But that's
all I'm gonna do.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.199
Excuse me.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.239
(door whooshes open)

14:32.272 --> 14:35.109
Commander, what
can I do for you?

14:35.142 --> 14:38.078
This isn't really
a "commander" request.

14:38.112 --> 14:41.215
This is more
of a "Kelly" request.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.382
Okay. What is it?

14:42.416 --> 14:43.883
I need you to check

14:43.917 --> 14:45.619
Captain Lavesque's quarters.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.053
Check them for what?

14:47.087 --> 14:49.123
I don't know yet.

14:50.157 --> 14:51.525
Okay.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.393
That's a little awkward for me,
regulation-wise.

14:53.427 --> 14:55.429
I mean, I can't just
go snooping around

14:55.462 --> 14:57.464
someone's quarters
without a reason.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.266
Unless you order me to.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.734
No, it's not an order.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.236
Here, look at this.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.305
It's the personnel manifest
for the Vega Consortium.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.073
There's no Pria Lavesque.

15:07.107 --> 15:11.245
Well, mining consortiums
do keep crappy records.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.548
Yeah, that's what Ed said.
I don't buy it.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.384
And I'm guessing he doesn't know
about your "Kelly" request?

15:17.417 --> 15:20.120
Look, can't you just come up
with some bogus security reason

15:20.154 --> 15:22.289
for a search?
I'm telling you,

15:22.322 --> 15:24.158
I have a bad feeling about her.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.295
I can put it in my security log

15:28.328 --> 15:29.496
as a radiation check.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.498
It's a little shaky
if anyone takes a close look,

15:31.531 --> 15:34.301
but I'll do it--
if you promise me one thing.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.735
What's that?
That your concern

15:35.769 --> 15:37.271
is purely in the line of duty

15:37.304 --> 15:39.173
and it has nothing to do
with the goo-goo eyes

15:39.206 --> 15:41.475
that the captain was making
at Pria during drinks.

15:41.508 --> 15:44.478
Okay, first of all, I didn't
notice any goo-goo eyes.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.246
And second of all,
even if there were,

15:46.280 --> 15:47.581
I wouldn't give a damn.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.184
This is 100%
in the line of duty.

15:50.217 --> 15:51.918
I'm a professional.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.020
(door chimes)
Housekeeping.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.161
(whirring)

16:02.996 --> 16:05.632
You know, it would help
me if I had some idea

16:05.665 --> 16:07.301
of what we were
looking for.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.002
Anything out of the ordinary.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.253
Commander.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.155
I might have something.

16:31.691 --> 16:32.859
(whirring)

16:32.892 --> 16:34.561
This is really strange.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.162
The scan can't penetrate it.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.031
Can't tell what's inside.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.366
(door in hallway whooshes open)

16:42.702 --> 16:44.404
PRIA:
Oh.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.240
Hey. ALARA: Captain Lavesque.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.975
Hi. Uh, sorry...
for the intrusion.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.212
We were just investigating
a possible radiation leak.

16:52.246 --> 16:54.248
Oh. Everything okay?

16:54.281 --> 16:55.849
It's fine.
Great.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.252
We just wanted to make sure
that you didn't go to bed

16:58.285 --> 17:01.221
and wake up with a third eye
or an extra kidney

17:01.255 --> 17:02.822
or... something.

17:02.856 --> 17:05.225
Oh, I've been exposed to so much
radiation in the mines.

17:05.259 --> 17:07.594
If I was gonna turn mutant,
it would have happened by now.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.229
Right. Of course.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.032
Well, I think we're
all finished here.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.401
Yes. All set.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.371
ALARA:
Again, sorry for the intrusion.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.386
â™ª

17:37.924 --> 17:39.626
You gotta be kidding me.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.295
Ed, just hear me out on this.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.297
You went into her quarters
and did a search?

17:43.330 --> 17:45.198
This was my doing.
I ordered Alara to assist me.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.901
I appreciate that, Commander.
But it's not true, Captain.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.936
I falsified the
entry permit.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.938
You are the chief of security
on a Union starship.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.740
You don't go searching
guest quarters

17:53.773 --> 17:56.610
without reasonable cause. Yes,
sir, but we both felt that...

17:56.643 --> 17:58.378
And you are my first officer,
all right?

17:58.412 --> 18:00.246
You're supposed
to be setting an example,

18:00.280 --> 18:02.248
and here you are
ransacking a room?

18:02.282 --> 18:04.284
What, did you read her diary, too?
No, we couldn't find it.

18:04.318 --> 18:05.151
But, Ed,

18:05.184 --> 18:06.386
we discovered an object.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.054
Metallic, rectangular
in shape...

18:08.087 --> 18:09.255
Oh, my God,
you found a rectangle.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.324
Good Lord, well,
should I sound

18:10.357 --> 18:11.325
the red alert now?
Our scans

18:11.358 --> 18:12.292
couldn't penetrate it.

18:12.326 --> 18:14.260
We had no idea
what it was.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.129
So it could be a belt buckle,
for all you know.

18:16.162 --> 18:18.932
I suppose it could be.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.800
I'm putting a formal reprimand
on your record.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.303
Dismissed.

18:26.306 --> 18:27.807
(door whooshes open)

18:27.841 --> 18:29.776
Ed,

18:29.809 --> 18:32.312
can I be perfectly honest with you?
(door whooshes closed)

18:32.346 --> 18:34.348
I don't think you're being
objective regarding Pria.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.115
(scoffs)
Wait, I'm sorry.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.984
I'm not being objective?

18:38.017 --> 18:39.152
I'm not being...

18:39.185 --> 18:40.354
I-I'm sorry, which one of us

18:40.387 --> 18:41.488
just went tossin' cells?

18:41.521 --> 18:43.189
How am I not
being objective?

18:43.222 --> 18:44.157
I think you're letting

18:44.190 --> 18:45.425
her charisma cloud the fact

18:45.459 --> 18:47.193
that she may not be
what she seems.

18:47.226 --> 18:49.496
I have no idea what you're talking about.
You were making

18:49.529 --> 18:51.331
goo-goo eyes at her
all through drinks.

18:51.365 --> 18:52.198
I was not making goo-goo eye...

18:52.231 --> 18:53.700
By the way, even if I was,

18:53.733 --> 18:54.834
even if I was,

18:54.868 --> 18:56.002
what business is that of yours?

18:56.035 --> 18:57.036
We're not together anymore.

18:57.070 --> 18:58.338
You can date whoever you want.

18:58.372 --> 18:59.205
So can I.
And that's fine.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.807
I'm not saying otherwise.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.509
But if it affects
your judgment as an officer,

19:02.542 --> 19:04.711
it is my job
to point it out to you.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.046
Hey, I'm not the one
playing Nancy Drew here.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.350
Okay? Look, let's... let's do
a sanity check, shall we?

19:10.384 --> 19:12.552
We rescued
this woman.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.488
Wha... What do you think,
she crashed her own ship

19:14.521 --> 19:16.456
just so she could come here
and do free laundry?

19:16.490 --> 19:17.991
And by the way,
by the way, yes,

19:18.024 --> 19:19.459
you know what,
I find her attractive.

19:19.493 --> 19:21.027
So what?
My concern

19:21.060 --> 19:22.796
is completely
unemotional, trust me.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.465
You can bang that chick on your
kitchen sink for all I care.

19:25.499 --> 19:27.367
I don't ever do it
near the food, you know that.

19:27.401 --> 19:28.902
But as your XO,
I am telling you,

19:28.935 --> 19:30.136
there is something wrong here.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.838
(loud bang)

19:31.871 --> 19:34.908
BORTUS (over comm): Captain,
please report to the bridge.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.711
ED:
Report.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.513
We don't know where
the impacts are coming from.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.647
There's nothing out there.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.048
(loud bang, alarm blares)

19:42.081 --> 19:43.717
Well, there's got to be
something out there.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.151
We're getting pounded.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.886
Captain, I believe
we may have encountered

19:46.920 --> 19:49.489
a concentrated
dark matter storm.

19:49.523 --> 19:50.857
Is that a thing?

19:50.890 --> 19:52.258
They are extremely rare.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.694
How do we get out of it?
Captain, I can...

19:56.062 --> 19:57.897
I can help.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.265
What do you mean?
We encountered

19:59.298 --> 20:01.067
a dark matter storm
on a mining expedition

20:01.100 --> 20:02.502
to Pollux 5.

20:02.536 --> 20:04.771
Adjust your weapons array
to flood the area

20:04.804 --> 20:06.372
with neutralized
axion particles.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.375
ISAAC:
A fascinating theory.

20:09.409 --> 20:12.846
I do not believe anyone has
ever attempted such a solution.

20:12.879 --> 20:13.847
PRIA:
Do it.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.114
Trust me.

20:17.451 --> 20:20.086
â™ª

20:22.321 --> 20:23.723
(brief whirr)

20:32.231 --> 20:33.399
Gordon, get us out of here.

20:40.339 --> 20:41.441
Oh, my God.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.996
(loud crashing)

21:03.029 --> 21:05.599
Sir! The impacts have severely
weakened our deflectors.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.267
Structural damage is imminent.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.470
ED: Gordon, what are our options?
Captain, I've never

21:10.504 --> 21:13.439
even seen a dark matter storm,
let alone flown through one.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.108
I can do it.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.309
What?

21:17.110 --> 21:18.444
I've done it before.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.113
Just give me helm control.

21:20.146 --> 21:21.881
KELLY:
Ed.

21:23.016 --> 21:24.283
Gordon?

21:24.317 --> 21:25.151
Might as well, Captain.

21:25.184 --> 21:27.153
This is above my pay grade.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.125
BORTUS: Deflectors
are gone, sir.

21:32.158 --> 21:33.459
One more hit
could destroy the Orville.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.794
Do it.

21:38.231 --> 21:40.900
â™ª

22:12.566 --> 22:15.234
â™ª

22:15.268 --> 22:17.236
(alarm sounds)

22:21.675 --> 22:23.109
(crash)

22:32.919 --> 22:35.388
(exhaling)

22:35.421 --> 22:36.990
Pound it.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.992
(chuckles)

22:39.025 --> 22:40.526
What's the
damage?

22:40.560 --> 22:42.829
Communications arrays
have been destroyed, but,

22:42.862 --> 22:44.831
otherwise, we are intact.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.332
Are communications
completely down?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.267
Affirmative.
Total blackout.

22:48.301 --> 22:50.670
We'll have to make a stop
at outpost 49 for repairs.

22:50.704 --> 22:52.405
That's five days off course.

22:52.438 --> 22:53.439
Well you know,
there's a Consortium base

22:53.472 --> 22:55.408
only a day away from here.

22:55.441 --> 22:57.611
I have some friends there,
and I'm sure they'll be happy

22:57.644 --> 23:00.079
to refit your communications
array. Plus, you can

23:00.113 --> 23:01.514
drop me off,
I'll be out of your hair.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.116
It's the least I can do

23:03.149 --> 23:04.450
after everything
you've done for me.

23:04.483 --> 23:05.952
Well, you just
saved our ship.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.353
I think we're even.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.255
But that would save
us a lot of time.

23:09.288 --> 23:12.926
Great. I'll give your navigator
the coordinates.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.761
You're letting her dictate
our course now, too?

23:14.794 --> 23:16.295
If we needed any more proof

23:16.329 --> 23:18.331
that she can be trusted,
we just got it.

23:21.134 --> 23:23.670
I want to show
you something.

23:26.305 --> 23:28.307
(birds singing)

23:32.111 --> 23:33.479
It's breathtaking.

23:33.512 --> 23:35.649
What's the name of
the planet again?

23:35.682 --> 23:37.283
Unuk Four.

23:37.316 --> 23:39.886
Our environmental simulator
doesn't really do it justice,

23:39.919 --> 23:41.287
but you get the idea.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.256
Have you ever been there?

23:43.289 --> 23:46.459
No, it's off-limits because
the people are nightmarish.

23:46.492 --> 23:49.829
They capture outsiders and then
sacrifice them to a raccoon god

23:49.863 --> 23:51.464
by methodically
dismembering them.

23:51.497 --> 23:54.267
Wow.
Yeah.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.269
It's a stunning place, though.

23:56.302 --> 23:59.105
Gorgeous place,
yeah. Yeah.

23:59.138 --> 24:03.609
So, where'd you learn
all those piloting tricks?

24:05.979 --> 24:07.146
I'm out there every day,

24:07.180 --> 24:08.982
flying by the seat
of my pants.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.818
People like me have
to be creative.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.387
Well, I like creative.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.770
I, um...

24:30.804 --> 24:32.972
I actually got out
of a rough marriage

24:33.006 --> 24:34.207
not too long ago, so I...

24:34.240 --> 24:38.377
I think maybe we should
take this slow.

24:38.411 --> 24:41.414
Or... or that.
That works, too.

24:43.582 --> 24:45.351
Hey, I'm sorry if I
pushed you into something

24:45.384 --> 24:47.153
you weren't ready for.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.122
No, no, it's...
that's good.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.556
PRIA: Really?
ED: Yeah.

24:50.589 --> 24:52.025
I just figure
it's always easier

24:52.058 --> 24:53.626
to talk in bed.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.328
(sighs) You know,
if we're being honest here,

24:55.361 --> 24:57.230
I... should tell you

24:57.263 --> 24:58.497
you're actually
the first person I've been with

24:58.531 --> 24:59.632
since my divorce.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.868
Oh, wow.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.703
That's no pressure
for me there.

25:03.737 --> 25:05.138
No, no, no,
you were fine.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.472
Uh, better than fine.
Really.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.074
You were blue chip.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.642
"Blue chip"?
Yeah.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.045
Your pillow talk's
a little rusty, huh?

25:12.078 --> 25:13.246
It is, isn't it?
Yeah.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.914
Yeah, okay, it's been
a while, sorry.

25:14.948 --> 25:17.250
What happened with
your marriage?

25:17.283 --> 25:19.218
If you don't want
to talk about it,

25:19.252 --> 25:21.054
it's okay.
No, it's...

25:21.087 --> 25:22.756
It's fine. Um...

25:22.789 --> 25:25.058
She cheated on me

25:25.091 --> 25:26.860
with a Retepsian.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.194
You know what they are?
They got the blue skin,

25:28.227 --> 25:29.695
they got the scales...
Oh...

25:29.729 --> 25:31.097
...the stuff that comes out
of the forehead.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.866
It's, like, a whole
weird mess.

25:32.899 --> 25:35.268
I'm sorry.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.669
You must have
been devastated.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.271
I was.
(sighs)

25:38.304 --> 25:41.174
But... I don't know,
at the same time

25:41.207 --> 25:42.208
I knew it was coming.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.443
I was working too much,

25:44.477 --> 25:47.914
and I didn't give us
the time that we deserved.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.216
Still, she could have just
asked you for a divorce.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.250
To be cheated on,

25:51.284 --> 25:53.452
man, that's...

25:53.486 --> 25:55.288
There's nothing worse than that.

25:58.324 --> 26:01.627
I haven't really trusted
anyone since then.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.131
Until now.

26:17.811 --> 26:19.913
(chiming)

26:21.247 --> 26:22.648
Huh...

26:22.681 --> 26:24.117
(device continues chiming)

26:24.150 --> 26:26.119
All right.

26:26.152 --> 26:27.553
All right, I'm up, I'm up.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.255
(chiming stops)

26:29.288 --> 26:31.024
(exhales):
Oh...

26:41.267 --> 26:42.268
(thud)

26:44.170 --> 26:46.172
(screaming)

26:48.341 --> 26:50.944
How far are we from
the Consortium base?

26:50.977 --> 26:52.445
About two hours.

26:52.478 --> 26:54.447
Keep forward scanners
at maximum.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.083
Kelly, what are you looking for?
I don't know.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.751
Trouble.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.186
GORDON:
Isaac!

27:00.219 --> 27:02.621
(gasps)
What the hell?

27:02.655 --> 27:03.756
What happened
to your leg?

27:03.789 --> 27:05.258
He amputated it

27:05.291 --> 27:06.459
while I was sleeping!

27:06.492 --> 27:09.295
Ha ha. Got you.
What?!

27:09.328 --> 27:10.263
I have retaliated.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.265
That is my practical joke.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.133
This isn't a joke,
you psychopath!

27:14.167 --> 27:15.468
You dismembered me!

27:15.501 --> 27:17.003
ISAAC:
I am confused.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.772
You said to be creative,
and you said to do it

27:19.805 --> 27:21.140
when you least
expected it.

27:21.174 --> 27:23.276
I have adhered
to both directives.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.845
Isaac, did you anesthetize
him in his sleep?

27:25.879 --> 27:26.980
Of course, Commander.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.181
It would not do
to have him awaken

27:28.214 --> 27:29.448
during the procedure.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.350
Well, where the hell
is it?

27:31.384 --> 27:33.552
If you are referring
to your leg, I have hidden it.

27:33.586 --> 27:35.821
Given its importance
to you,

27:35.855 --> 27:37.857
it seemed the most
humorous course of action.

27:37.891 --> 27:39.859
Son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!

27:39.893 --> 27:42.228
ED: Oh, hey, hey, Gordon... I swear
to God, I'm gonna unplug you!

27:42.261 --> 27:44.163
ED: It'll be easier just to
have Dr. Finn regenerate it.

27:44.197 --> 27:45.965
Alara, take him to sick bay.
Come on.

27:45.999 --> 27:48.001
You're sick, dude.
I mean it.

27:48.034 --> 27:51.004
There is something really
friggin' wrong with you!

27:51.037 --> 27:53.973
It seems I have
much to learn about humor.

27:54.007 --> 27:55.141
What did I do wrong?

27:55.174 --> 27:57.310
Well, Isaac,
you can't just cut off...

27:57.343 --> 27:59.078
STEVE (over comm): Captain, I
think you and Commander Grayson

27:59.112 --> 28:00.679
had better come
to engineering.

28:00.713 --> 28:01.981
Chief, what's the matter?

28:02.015 --> 28:03.249
We found something strange

28:03.282 --> 28:04.517
in the navigational relays.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.152
We're on our way.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.553
(door whooshes open)

28:09.355 --> 28:10.589
What is it, Chief?

28:10.623 --> 28:12.258
Yaphit was in the
navigational conduits

28:12.291 --> 28:13.927
doing a maintenance check
when he found this.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.663
KELLY: That's the object
Alara and I found

28:17.696 --> 28:20.333
in Pria's quarters.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.735
(sighs)

28:22.768 --> 28:25.271
Can you, um...
Can you remove it?

28:25.304 --> 28:26.605
We tried.
It's in tight.

28:26.639 --> 28:28.174
We'd have to blast it out,

28:28.207 --> 28:29.575
which could damage
the main relay.

28:33.279 --> 28:36.315
Mercer to Alara.
Meet us at Pria's quarters.

28:43.756 --> 28:47.360
Hey.
What's going on?

28:47.393 --> 28:49.228
We found something
in engineering.

28:49.262 --> 28:51.164
We were hoping you could
tell us what it is.

28:54.500 --> 28:58.104
Well, I see the cat's out
of the bag.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.138
I think it's time
for you to tell us

28:59.172 --> 29:00.306
who the hell you really are.

29:03.009 --> 29:05.411
I'm from the 29th century,

29:05.444 --> 29:07.780
about 400 years
in your future.

29:07.813 --> 29:10.416
When your ship encountered
that dark matter storm,

29:10.449 --> 29:13.152
you were all supposed to die.

29:30.636 --> 29:33.806
You honestly expect us to
believe you're a time traveler?

29:33.839 --> 29:35.241
It's the truth.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.343
Oh, I almost forgot.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.816
What the hell?

29:47.153 --> 29:48.787
Lamarr to Captain.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.256
What is it?

29:50.289 --> 29:51.757
JOHN:
Sir, I've lost helm control.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.592
Something else is driving
the ship.

29:53.626 --> 29:57.163
Ooh, it's a handy
little device. (sighs)

29:57.196 --> 29:59.032
It's actually what
piloted your ship

29:59.065 --> 30:01.534
through that dark matter storm.
KELLY: You're telling us

30:01.567 --> 30:03.302
you came back in time
to save our lives?

30:03.336 --> 30:05.204
Why?

30:05.238 --> 30:07.373
I'm afraid it wasn't your lives
I wanted to save.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.642
It was your ship.

30:09.675 --> 30:11.510
Wait, if you really are from
the future, what possible use

30:11.544 --> 30:12.811
could the Orville be to you?

30:12.845 --> 30:15.148
I'm a dealer in artifacts.

30:15.181 --> 30:16.715
Mint condition.

30:16.749 --> 30:18.717
Mostly I sell
to private collectors.

30:18.751 --> 30:21.387
I, and others who do
what I do, travel back

30:21.420 --> 30:24.623
to a specific time and place
in which, say,

30:24.657 --> 30:26.292
a ship like yours
was destroyed.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.327
I prevent the destruction,

30:28.361 --> 30:29.695
then I take the ship
into the future

30:29.728 --> 30:31.330
and I sell it
to the highest bidder.

30:31.364 --> 30:33.032
What about the crews
of those ships?

30:33.066 --> 30:34.567
Well, they're free
to live out their lives

30:34.600 --> 30:37.503
as they see fit
in the 29th century.

30:37.536 --> 30:40.573
Wait, we rescued you.
All of us were in danger.

30:44.877 --> 30:47.546
Never... never mind
about that.

30:47.580 --> 30:49.715
What about the comet?
A set-up.

30:49.748 --> 30:52.051
A quick and easy way
to get you to trust me.

30:52.085 --> 30:54.587
Look, none of us were ever
in any real danger.

30:54.620 --> 30:59.325
We can do things
in my time that...

30:59.358 --> 31:01.994
Well, you're gonna
find out for yourself.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.263
Then why didn't you take control
of the ship right away?

31:04.297 --> 31:06.165
ALARA: You obviously
had the power.

31:06.199 --> 31:08.767
I'm a businesswoman,
not a soldier.

31:08.801 --> 31:11.337
I like comfort
and company,

31:11.370 --> 31:13.672
and you've provided both.

31:13.706 --> 31:16.142
I'm not just talking
about the food.

31:19.712 --> 31:22.115
How do you do it--

31:22.148 --> 31:23.616
travel through time?

31:23.649 --> 31:26.219
We found a stable wormhole
in the 29th century.

31:26.252 --> 31:27.786
Those of us who are
in the business

31:27.820 --> 31:29.054
learned to manipulate it.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.223
This wormhole--

31:30.256 --> 31:31.424
that's where we're headed.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.625
I'm sorry I had to knock out

31:32.658 --> 31:34.227
your communications array.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.595
I couldn't have you
chatting anyone up

31:36.629 --> 31:38.097
if you're supposed to be dead.

31:38.131 --> 31:39.698
How many times
have you done this?

31:39.732 --> 31:41.134
When we get to my century,

31:41.167 --> 31:43.836
I'll introduce you
to Amelia Earhart.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.274
Would the two of you give me
a moment alone

31:48.307 --> 31:49.575
with Captain Lavesque?

31:49.608 --> 31:50.876
Should we take the leg?

31:50.909 --> 31:52.178
Yes, take the leg.
Get the...

31:55.914 --> 31:57.583
And post a guard
on these quarters.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.152
Aye, sir.

32:00.819 --> 32:02.188
A guard won't matter.

32:09.195 --> 32:11.797
Was it all just a lie?

32:11.830 --> 32:14.667
Not all of it.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.902
I did feel
something for you.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.338
(scoffs)
You'll forgive me

32:19.372 --> 32:21.740
if I have a hard time
believing that.

32:21.774 --> 32:24.243
Ed, you were all going
to die anyway.

32:24.277 --> 32:27.180
Now you'll have a
second chance to live

32:27.213 --> 32:28.981
in a future full
of wonders

32:29.014 --> 32:31.917
you can't even imagine.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.321
I'd still like to see
where you and I could go.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.156
I know where you can go.

32:37.190 --> 32:39.124
Where?

32:39.158 --> 32:41.260
To hell.

32:41.294 --> 32:42.528
You-you can go to hell.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.297
Is that an expression?

32:44.330 --> 32:45.964
It is. In my century.

32:45.998 --> 32:47.333
I've never heard it.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.735
Well, it's... it's not good.

32:53.172 --> 32:56.141
I do care about you.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.076
Whether you believe me or not.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.452
Kelly!

33:06.485 --> 33:08.621
Kelly, wait.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.223
Hey, listen, I don't want to
play the blame game here...

33:10.256 --> 33:11.557
That's because you're
the one to blame.

33:11.590 --> 33:12.625
Look, we all made mistakes.

33:12.658 --> 33:13.959
Nobody made mistakes
but you.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.194
Let's not do the
"I told you so" thing.

33:15.228 --> 33:17.029
I told you so, numerous times.
Okay, look.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.631
Fine, you were right. Okay?

33:18.664 --> 33:21.200
I'm sorry.
She was a bad seed. And-And

33:21.234 --> 33:23.402
she caught me where I was
vulnerable, and I'm just,

33:23.436 --> 33:25.871
I'm really, genuinely sorry.

33:25.904 --> 33:28.207
Well, we're supposed
to be dead anyway,

33:28.241 --> 33:30.008
so I guess it doesn't matter.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.477
Hell, by temporal law,

33:31.510 --> 33:32.845
we should probably
commit suicide

33:32.878 --> 33:34.580
to keep the timeline intact.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.249
Well, the timeline's
already been changed,

33:36.282 --> 33:38.016
so slitting our wrists
wouldn't be any more correct

33:38.050 --> 33:39.252
than the way things are now.

33:41.787 --> 33:44.056
I'm glad we didn't die
while I was mad at you.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.691
Me, too.

33:46.959 --> 33:49.161
I might have an idea.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.430
(gun powers up)

33:51.464 --> 33:53.766
Ah! Damn it.
(gun clatters)

33:53.799 --> 33:55.268
All right,
so that's not gonna work.

33:56.134 --> 33:57.236
Could I make a suggestion?

33:57.270 --> 33:58.937
What is it?

33:58.971 --> 34:01.407
Old-style, antique
diamond-tipped drill.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.442
Was a graduation gift
from my uncle.

34:03.476 --> 34:04.877
No fancy energy beams,

34:04.910 --> 34:07.280
just good ole brute force.
Might work.

34:07.313 --> 34:09.515
Could be too arcane
for the device to register.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.384
Do it.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.226
Bingo.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.662
All right, Isaac,
it's all up to you.

34:25.163 --> 34:25.631
(beeping, whirring)

34:29.968 --> 34:33.439
I believe I have access
to the internal circuitry.

34:33.472 --> 34:34.607
It is

34:34.640 --> 34:36.241
quite sophisticated.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.843
I have never encountered
anything like...

34:39.645 --> 34:41.280
KELLY: Isaac!
ED: Isaac!

34:42.748 --> 34:45.150
(crackling)

34:45.183 --> 34:47.586
(powering down)

34:52.291 --> 34:54.360
There's no internal activity
at all.

34:55.528 --> 34:57.830
He's dead.

35:13.379 --> 35:15.414
Is there anything you
can do for him, Doc?

35:15.448 --> 35:17.015
Gordon, I'm a doctor.

35:17.049 --> 35:19.318
My expertise
is in biology.

35:19.352 --> 35:20.819
This is more like
fixing an engine.

35:20.853 --> 35:22.321
STEVE:
It's a lot more complicated

35:22.355 --> 35:24.122
than that, I'm afraid.

35:24.156 --> 35:25.424
Let's recheck the database.

35:25.458 --> 35:26.825
We don't know much about him,

35:26.859 --> 35:28.160
but maybe there's
something we missed.

35:34.567 --> 35:36.369
Hey, buddy.

35:36.402 --> 35:39.271
I don't know if you're in there,
or if you can hear me, but...

35:39.304 --> 35:43.175
I know the last time I saw you
I called you a son of a bitch.

35:43.208 --> 35:45.811
I was just angry
'cause you took my leg.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.981
But, when I really stopped
to think about it,

35:49.014 --> 35:53.218
that was honest to God
the best damn practical joke

35:53.251 --> 35:56.288
I've ever seen in my life.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.190
I just...

35:58.223 --> 36:00.225
I just wanted you to know that.
(comm beeps)

36:00.258 --> 36:02.795
ED (over comm):
Mercer to Malloy

36:02.828 --> 36:04.329
Malloy here.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.198
I need you on the bridge.

36:06.231 --> 36:08.066
Seriously?

36:09.402 --> 36:11.269
Captain, we're approaching
the coordinates.

36:13.271 --> 36:14.640
Reporting as ordered, sir.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.342
Gordon, take the helm.
CLAIRE: Captain,

36:17.376 --> 36:18.711
his limb regeneration
is incomplete.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.379
If I could just...
I need him here.

36:20.413 --> 36:21.914
Particularly with Isaac down.

36:21.947 --> 36:23.582
If we have any chance
of getting out this,

36:23.616 --> 36:26.018
I need everyone at their station.
JOHN: Captain?

36:26.051 --> 36:27.420
I think we've arrived.

36:37.262 --> 36:38.564
What the hell?

36:38.597 --> 36:40.399
Sorry to barge in like this,

36:40.433 --> 36:43.602
it's just... we're approaching
the rendezvous point.

36:43.636 --> 36:44.603
Captain, I can
put her to sleep

36:44.637 --> 36:46.772
real quick,
just say the word.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.074
Hold up on that.

36:49.107 --> 36:52.611
Well, it's good to know
teleportation is in our future.

36:52.645 --> 36:55.414
You can take a breath in
New York and exhale it in Paris.

36:55.448 --> 36:56.782
Pria, listen,

36:56.815 --> 36:58.584
give me back my ship.

36:58.617 --> 37:00.185
We'll give you a shuttle,
you can take it

37:00.218 --> 37:01.454
through the wormhole
to your own time.

37:01.487 --> 37:03.889
But there are 300 people
on board the Orville

37:03.922 --> 37:05.591
who have lives
in this century.

37:05.624 --> 37:07.359
They have families here.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.762
You still don't get it.

37:09.795 --> 37:12.197
You all died.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.566
If I were to let you go,

37:13.599 --> 37:16.101
I'd be the one altering
the timeline.

37:16.134 --> 37:16.969
GORDON:
Captain,

37:17.002 --> 37:18.170
we're heading through.

37:46.031 --> 37:48.033
â™ª

37:53.539 --> 37:55.774
What is that?

37:57.009 --> 37:59.277
Lavesque to Binzian ship.

37:59.311 --> 38:02.280
I have the merchandise,
as promised.

38:02.314 --> 38:05.851
Poz shivik, Zars Lavesque.
Shto kavak lo?

38:05.884 --> 38:07.653
PRIA:
Couple of scratches.

38:07.686 --> 38:10.188
Nothing that would affect the
value in any significant way.

38:10.222 --> 38:13.792
Regardless, I'll be happy
to negotiate the price.

38:13.826 --> 38:16.261
Shtak fehvor zemik,
dosh mook fillory vem.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.130
PRIA: Of course.

38:18.163 --> 38:19.598
Nobody's trying
to stiff you here.

38:19.632 --> 38:22.200
Pohzhy revost deck ferenos.

38:22.234 --> 38:25.437
Ofor feclis eez meseem.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.373
Always like to keep
the customer happy.

38:29.875 --> 38:30.776
No! What the hell are you...?

38:30.809 --> 38:31.877
(Pria grunts)

38:31.910 --> 38:33.178
Helm control
is back online.

38:33.211 --> 38:34.446
Gordon, get us
out of here.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.348
(grunting)

38:41.253 --> 38:43.421
Transfer all power
to the sublight drive.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.992
Sir, the alien ship
is powering up

38:47.025 --> 38:48.260
some kind of a tractor beam.

38:54.199 --> 38:57.335
John, modulate the deflector frequency
as fast as you can. Aye, sir.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.155
PRIA:
Nice sucker punch.

39:17.189 --> 39:19.658
I'd expect that from a woman
who cheats on her husband.

39:19.692 --> 39:21.627
You told her?

39:22.895 --> 39:24.329
No. No, I didn't tell her.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.598
She... she knows

39:25.631 --> 39:27.199
'cause she's from the future.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.901
But it's in the past.

39:30.235 --> 39:32.337
I told her.
Alara, take her to the brig.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.972
Come on.

39:36.274 --> 39:37.610
(door whooshes open)

39:37.643 --> 39:39.077
Isaac, you there?

39:39.111 --> 39:40.278
ISAAC (over comm):
Yes, sir.

39:40.312 --> 39:42.514
My algorithms were
successfully transferred

39:42.547 --> 39:43.849
to the ship's computer

39:43.882 --> 39:45.350
before the energy burst.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.886
I trust my physical body
is still intact.

39:47.920 --> 39:50.355
It's a little toasty,
but it's all in one piece.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.124
Nice touch with
the Junior Mints.

39:52.157 --> 39:54.693
I felt it prudent to alert you
of my success

39:54.727 --> 39:56.629
in a fashion that would not
appear obvious

39:56.662 --> 39:58.096
if Pria were to see it.

39:58.130 --> 40:00.065
Captain, can I go finish
my leg now?

40:00.098 --> 40:01.033
Yeah, go ahead.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.100
Thank you.

40:02.134 --> 40:03.268
Come on.

40:03.301 --> 40:05.470
Well, I'll tell you
one thing,

40:05.503 --> 40:07.239
never again will
I make the mistake

40:07.272 --> 40:08.841
of not trusting
my first officer.

40:10.308 --> 40:11.910
I'm sorry.

40:20.352 --> 40:22.187
(door chimes)
Come in.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.661
Thanks, Alara. You can go.

40:28.694 --> 40:31.229
I'll be outside
if there's any trouble.

40:31.263 --> 40:33.632
We'll be fine.

40:33.666 --> 40:35.333
(door whooshes closed)

40:37.102 --> 40:40.305
Isaac tells me this is
what you used to teleport.

40:40.338 --> 40:41.606
Congratulations,

40:41.640 --> 40:44.009
you have technology
from the future.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.645
I suppose you're gonna
crack it open and study it.

40:46.679 --> 40:49.281
No.

40:49.314 --> 40:52.150
Unlike you, we don't mess
with the timeline.

40:52.184 --> 40:53.251
Well,

40:53.285 --> 40:55.854
what happens now?

40:57.555 --> 40:59.992
You know what the most
depressing part about this is?

41:01.359 --> 41:04.262
I allowed myself
to care about you,

41:04.296 --> 41:06.131
and you used me.

41:06.164 --> 41:09.201
And despite all of your claims
that you still care about me,

41:09.234 --> 41:12.838
not once have you even said,
"I'm sorry."

41:12.871 --> 41:16.208
It's a good rule in life
never to apologize.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.711
The right kind of people
never want apologies,

41:18.744 --> 41:22.347
and the wrong kind
take advantage of them.

41:22.380 --> 41:24.316
Fair enough.

41:24.349 --> 41:25.918
It doesn't have to end.

41:27.519 --> 41:30.322
Just come with me.

41:30.355 --> 41:31.957
If the Orville continues
to exist,

41:31.990 --> 41:34.292
who knows how it will
affect the timeline?

41:34.326 --> 41:36.161
The Orvil was supposed
to be destroyed

41:36.194 --> 41:37.495
in that dark matter storm.

41:37.529 --> 41:39.698
You changed those events,
not us.

41:39.732 --> 41:42.134
And as far as how that
affects your future time,

41:42.167 --> 41:43.201
I don't give a damn.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.004
According to Isaac,

41:46.038 --> 41:48.841
as long as the wormhole exists,

41:48.874 --> 41:50.909
the quantum potentiality
is open.

41:50.943 --> 41:52.577
Many sets of future events
are possible.

41:52.610 --> 41:56.214
But, if we destroy it,
we choose a path.

41:56.248 --> 41:59.251
There's no chance of us
returning to your future,

41:59.284 --> 42:01.186
and the Orville goes on
to live its life.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.088
Which means

42:03.121 --> 42:05.590
that Pria Lavesque
will have no reason

42:05.623 --> 42:08.193
to come back into our past.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.428
And you and I will never
have met.

42:14.432 --> 42:16.201
You'd still be that
messed up guy

42:16.234 --> 42:18.203
who can't get over his ex-wife.

42:20.405 --> 42:24.109
Is that what you really want?

42:26.278 --> 42:27.612
(comm beeps)

42:29.647 --> 42:31.249
Mercer to bridge.

42:35.387 --> 42:36.454
Fire.

43:07.619 --> 43:11.623
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

43:54.199 --> 43:56.134
You've explored space
with The Orville.
