I'm afraid there's still
no sign of our Dr. Thomas.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.800
She knows this jungle very well.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.433
She can survive out there indefinitely.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.433
[ Man On Radio ]
That's a problem.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.933
[ Richard ] There may be a solution.
We have her nephew.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.900
[ Man On Radio ]
Oh, a hostage.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.400
We prefer to think of him
as our special guest.

19:41.900 --> 19:47.833
I suspect he may be the one thing that
can help us get through to the good doctor.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.333
[ Man On Radio ] Excellent.
Stay in touch then. Over.

19:50.833 --> 19:53.833
My pleasure. Over and out.

20:06.267 --> 20:09.767
[ Grunts, Panting ]
Hey, man.

20:09.767 --> 20:12.267
You've gotta help me.
Listen.

20:12.267 --> 20:14.267
I'm not sure, but Dr. Hawlings
is up to something.

20:14.267 --> 20:15.733
He might be lying about my aunt.

20:15.733 --> 20:19.200
Is there a phone around here I can use?
I have to call the police.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.600
Hey. Hey, are you
listening to me? Hey!

20:22.600 --> 20:25.600
[ Snarling ]

20:25.600 --> 20:29.100
[ Gasping, Screaming ]
Hey!

20:29.100 --> 20:32.600
Get your hands off me!
Let go! Let go of me!

20:32.600 --> 20:36.100
I'm sorry, Mark.
I'm afraid he can't do that.

20:36.100 --> 20:39.067
In fact, I'm afraid
you're not going anywhere.

20:39.067 --> 20:41.533
[ Yells ]

20:44.967 --> 20:47.367
