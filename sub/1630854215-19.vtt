00:01.602 --> 00:03.237
<i>Previously on</i> The Good Doctor <i>...</i>

00:03.237 --> 00:05.773
I want to do another
embryo transfer ASAP.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.275
You have some lettuce.

00:07.275 --> 00:08.542
- Oh.
- No, no, no. Here.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.151
Dr. Glassman, it would be
hard to lose my father

00:17.151 --> 00:19.019
just as I am about
to become one.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.889
Do the scan for me.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.297
Please hold still.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.632
I'm breathing.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.434
You moved your head.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.703
Shaun, go away and let
the technician do his job.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.471
I sent him out for coffee.

00:37.471 --> 00:40.674
I am now scanning the location
of your prior tumor.

00:43.043 --> 00:46.480
Did you decline
maintenance chemotherapy?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.482
It's hard to hold still
while I'm talking.

00:48.482 --> 00:51.952
Dr. Blaize recommended
six cycles of temozolomide.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.187
The slight benefit
of that stuff

00:53.187 --> 00:54.388
wasn't worth
the constant nausea.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.124
The benefit is
statistically--

00:56.124 --> 00:57.325
Shaun, I made my choice.

00:59.727 --> 01:00.828
You chose wrong.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.067
There's a spot on your brain.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.682
There's
the right ovary.
And that looks like the--

01:21.682 --> 01:23.417
Corpus luteum.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.920
The endometrium is smooth
and around 13 millimeters,

01:26.920 --> 01:29.056
which means my uterine
infection is cleared.

01:29.056 --> 01:32.726
Carrying the pregnancy
to term should be a lot
easier this time.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.662
Your transfer
is on my schedule
for tomorrow evening.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.264
Fantastic.

01:36.264 --> 01:39.367
And you have two
high-grade embryos available.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.237
Do you want a boy or a girl?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.779
You don't have to decide now.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.314
Just let me know
before the embryo transfer.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.289
Seven and a half hours.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.723
Uninterrupted?

02:02.723 --> 02:04.258
Didn't even have to wake up
to use the bathroom.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.494
So?

02:07.161 --> 02:08.596
Six hours, 45 minutes.

02:08.596 --> 02:11.699
Oh, winner, winner,
pancakes for dinner.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.534
I really thought
I had it in the bag.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.102
How'd you do, Danny?

02:15.102 --> 02:16.170
How much sleep you get?
Over or under?

02:16.670 --> 02:17.738
No clue.

02:24.778 --> 02:25.579
Hold up.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.918
- Morning, all.
- Morning.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.085
Dr. Allen.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.388
Good morning, Dr. Kalu.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.224
Park is doing
a hip arthroscopy today.

02:36.224 --> 02:37.558
I'd like to scrub in.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.793
Sorry, I'm already
assigned to Park.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.562
I'm thinking about
specializing in ortho,

02:41.562 --> 02:43.096
so how about a trade?

02:43.096 --> 02:44.164
How about no?

02:45.799 --> 02:47.201
Sorry I asked.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.304
Go, team.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.010
Brady Sullivan.
Oil rig worker.
Metal sheet hit him.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.779
Severe chest
and pelvic injuries.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.248
O2 sats are critical.

03:00.248 --> 03:02.082
Brady, I'm Dr. Andrews.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.451
He's non-responsive.
Sluggish pupils.

03:03.451 --> 03:04.585
There's
major hemorrhage.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.153
GCS six, no head trauma.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.656
Three-inch right-sided
sucking chest wound.
Collapsed lung.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.291
That's from the support hook.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.526
The metal sheet he was welding
caused another injury.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.129
How deep does this go?

03:16.129 --> 03:17.865
Down to the spinal column.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.032
He's nearly cut in half.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.050
It's scar tissue
from the radiation.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.652
Could be, but the FA value--

03:38.652 --> 03:41.221
Is more consistent with
a glioblastoma recurrence.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.456
That's right, and the path

03:42.456 --> 03:44.692
of the radiation
they blasted me with,

03:44.692 --> 03:46.860
that Swiss cheese look,
textbook necrosis.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.663
The irregular shape implies
a multifocal cancerous lesion.

03:49.663 --> 03:50.864
I've been looking
at brain scans

03:50.864 --> 03:52.232
since before electricity.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.567
I think I know what
scar tissue looks like.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.835
You are not objective here.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.003
Oh, right, and you are?

03:56.003 --> 03:56.837
Neither of you are.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.509
If that lesion is cancer,

04:01.509 --> 04:03.411
a DNA spinal fluid analysis
will confirm it.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.112
Yes.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.381
That is objective.

04:07.381 --> 04:10.050
I'll do a spinal tap
and send it to the lab.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.285
Should have results
in 24 hours.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.254
Fine.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.425
I'll set it up.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.230
O2 sat's 68.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.699
Chest tube's in,
draining a lot of blood.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.668
Every time I clamp a bleeder,
another one pops up.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.170
Dr. Lim?
Where do you want us?

04:30.170 --> 04:31.339
We're busy with
the chest trauma.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.373
I need you guys
on the pelvic injury.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.274
How do we remove it?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.176
You don't.
It's the only reason
he didn't bleed out.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.678
I need you four
to figure out a plan

04:37.678 --> 04:39.413
to reattach his lower half.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.682
Read every journal.
Study every case report.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.351
Check all the international
surgery registries.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.452
Look everywhere.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.719
PA ruptured. Gotta move him.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.087
OR one, now.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.298
Give me the baby.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.900
I'm here for Jazz.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.535
- Just hand her to me.
- I don't know you.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.771
I don't know you.
I don't know you.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.239
- Sir, please.
- Hold on, let me talk to him.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.642
I'm a doctor here.
I can help you.

05:08.642 --> 05:12.446
I don't need a doctor.
I need Jazz.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.315
Jazz. Is Jazz the mother?

05:15.315 --> 05:16.984
Yes.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.419
You're trying
to help the baby?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.489
Jazz... Jazz passed out

05:21.489 --> 05:23.924
and then the, uh...
the flashing lights took her.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.659
An ambulance?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.127
There's an encampment
over on Elm.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.195
Is that where you
and Jazz were?

05:30.297 --> 05:31.765
Then she's a patient here.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.605
They didn't see the baby
in her tent.

05:37.605 --> 05:40.340
She didn't sound good.
She... she needs her mama.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.378
You did the right thing
bringing her here.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.515
Can I examine her?

05:50.117 --> 05:51.184
Uh...

05:52.620 --> 05:55.523
and you'll... you'll find...
you'll find Jazz?

05:56.624 --> 05:57.958
I promise.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.170
We have a code pink.
The baby's in heart failure.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.405
You may have saved her life.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.944
Found another tear
in the pulmonary artery.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.512
A big one.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.147
Every
major artery in this lung
is damaged.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.950
His body needs to divert
every resource it has

06:22.950 --> 06:25.018
to his vital organs.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.455
We should amputate
his lower half.

06:27.455 --> 06:29.623
We're not there yet.
It's barely hanging on.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.792
But it is.
We're gonna try to save it.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.160
It's a big job
to hand the residents.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.361
Good thing
I hire the best.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.366
This vessel's too damaged
to repair.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.535
I need to clamp the trunk.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.774
Start the clock
on lung ischemia.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.315
I think
we should sack

06:55.315 --> 06:58.085
the upper segmental
pulmonary artery.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.053
That would
mean he'd lose
his upper lung lobe.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.655
He has a physical job.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.090
If we
end up amputating,

07:03.090 --> 07:04.858
he's not gonna be
working oil rigs.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.326
But he could be
playing wheelchair basketball.

07:06.326 --> 07:08.428
PTFE graft on his artery
could save his lung.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.632
Okay.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.675
Central line is in.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.511
Pushing milrinone
to increase cardiac output.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.212
Severely decreased
heart function,

07:25.212 --> 07:26.514
but her chambers look normal.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.215
Increasing high flow oxygen.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.250
BP
is improving a little.
- Found it.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.919
In her posterior chest,
there's a critical--

07:31.919 --> 07:33.120
Narrowing of her aorta.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.691
Her eye spacing
is approximately

07:37.691 --> 07:40.093
six millimeters wider
than the upper limit of normal.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.294
She also has
slightly low-set ears

07:41.294 --> 07:43.063
and her hands are swollen.

07:47.434 --> 07:48.836
She has Turner syndrome.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.443
If we don't get that narrowing
fixed in the next few days,

07:56.443 --> 07:57.477
she'll die.

07:59.346 --> 08:01.414
It won't be easy to access,
but I need an angio

08:01.414 --> 08:03.250
for a better view.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.118
I'll locate the mother
and get consent.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.594
Brady's pelvis is broken

08:13.594 --> 08:15.095
and separated
from the spinal column.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.064
So to reattach
his lower half,

08:17.064 --> 08:19.499
we need to repair the pelvis,
plus all the damaged organs,

08:19.499 --> 08:21.802
plus the major
vascular injuries,

08:21.802 --> 08:23.637
and then find a way
to ensure it all heals.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.909
Are we even doing
the right thing
by trying to fix this?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.510
You want to give up
before we even start?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.279
I've just never read anything

08:32.279 --> 08:33.847
supporting reattaching
this kind of injury.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.115
Could kill him.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.349
Amputation is
the safest thing to do.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.517
Lim already knows
about that option.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.519
- Our job is to find
a better one.
- No, our job--

08:39.519 --> 08:41.855
Danny's right.
We need to divide and conquer.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.324
I will work on organ damage.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.926
I'll focus
on public fractures.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.428
I need intraoperative imaging
to build a 3D model.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.830
Oh, well, I'll go with you.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.365
I need to see the full extent
of the vascular injuries.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.735
That leaves you to figure out
how these repairs heal.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.071
I'll see what I can find.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.345
- This is the baby's mom?
- We think so.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.546
She was brought in
a few hours ago

09:06.546 --> 09:07.948
from a homeless encampment

09:07.948 --> 09:09.549
with a delayed
postpartum infection.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.119
She's septic.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.422
They're optimistic
she'll pull through.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.026
Soon, let's hope.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.662
We've got some big decisions
to make for her baby.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.240
Her name's Jasmine West.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.009
She's homeless
and has bipolar disorder.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.646
County records show the baby
was born seven weeks ago.

09:38.646 --> 09:42.249
No dad in the picture,
no other family.

09:42.249 --> 09:46.353
And this was all she had on her
when EMS brought her in.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.554
We need your consent

09:47.554 --> 09:49.757
for the baby's
diagnostic angiogram.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.859
Sure.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.261
The baby's Turner syndrome
makes every procedure,

09:54.261 --> 09:56.396
even a diagnostic test,
a little riskier.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.599
Well, this is
your area of expertise.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.614
Her baby's name is Eden.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.788
Pretty close
to the upper lung bifurcation.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.622
I reinforced it
with sealant.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.524
With a synthetic wrap?

10:24.524 --> 10:26.259
Are you
questioning my
surgical skills?

10:26.259 --> 10:27.795
Are you
getting defensive?

10:31.264 --> 10:33.266
Okay. We're done.

10:33.266 --> 10:34.467
Let's test it.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.777
Good job.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.462
Cardiac function stable.
You're good to go.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.932
Inserting the catheter.

11:04.932 --> 11:08.668
What a cute little girl.
Little girls are cute.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.004
- Mine would be really cute.
- Yeah, she'd be adorable.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.205
A boy could be adorable too.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.708
Are you trying
to pick your embryo?

11:15.475 --> 11:16.844
I'm leaning towards a girl.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.746
I have a playbook to work from.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.347
My playbook
didn't help me much.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.915
A lot of my issues
with Kellan came

11:21.915 --> 11:23.516
from me trying to stop him

11:23.516 --> 11:25.352
from making
the mistakes I made.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.686
If I'd had a daughter,
maybe I wouldn't have

11:26.686 --> 11:27.955
dumped all my baggage on her.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.123
You should choose a girl.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.960
But you're having a boy.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.594
We didn't get to choose.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.096
In all long-term
health metrics,

11:36.096 --> 11:38.131
females are more likely
to outperform males,

11:38.131 --> 11:40.000
although they'll probably
make less money.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.568
The narrowing is longer
than it measured on echo.

11:45.672 --> 11:47.707
We should resect
the narrowed segment

11:47.707 --> 11:50.343
and do an aortic anastomosis.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.145
Huge surgery for a baby.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.147
It's the only
definitive treatment.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.983
Very definitive
if she dies on the table.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.484
Balloon dilation is safer.

11:57.484 --> 12:00.287
We can do a bigger procedure
in a few years when Eden
can tolerate it.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.823
Her heart failure could
relapse between surgeries.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.063
Your two-step approach
is safer,

12:10.063 --> 12:11.698
but only if the baby gets
daily medication

12:11.698 --> 12:13.500
and regular follow-up care.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.268
That's a lot to ask
of a homeless mom.

12:19.672 --> 12:22.509
I'll page CPS
and get consent.

12:22.509 --> 12:23.911
You two practice the surgery.

12:23.911 --> 12:24.778
A lot.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.751
His pelvis looks
like a jigsaw puzzle
with a 100 missing pieces.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.554
Jared may be right.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.025
You're taking his side.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.492
I'm not taking anyone's side.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.294
- Scans don't lie.
- Okay.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.833
I'm not sure
if you're mad at him or me,

12:45.833 --> 12:47.968
but we all need to get along.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.239
Well, you two seemed
to be getting along

12:52.239 --> 12:53.640
pretty well at the taco truck
the other night.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.010
That was nothing.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.178
Mm-hmm.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.646
You're spying on me?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.282
I was getting a taco.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.352
This green-eyed monster thing
is not a good look for you.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.854
I'm not jealous.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.956
But you're right.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.859
We're supposed to be a team.
He's just not a good fit.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.393
Let's just focus
on the patient.

13:15.062 --> 13:15.829
Fine.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.201
Can't see how
we're gonna repair

13:21.201 --> 13:22.970
all of that arterial damage.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.605
What if we don't?

13:27.774 --> 13:28.808
They could bypass it.

13:30.677 --> 13:31.912
All of it.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.251
This paper
by Dr. Alice Chen features

13:38.251 --> 13:39.452
interesting data
on tumor treating fields

13:39.452 --> 13:40.921
for GBM tumors.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.589
I'm trying to enjoy
my tuna melt.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.757
Dr. Chen is starting
a new study soon.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.293
You should call her.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.661
I'm not gonna spend the day
chasing down cancer treatments

13:48.661 --> 13:51.331
because I don't have cancer.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.167
Okay, there is a higher
probability of cancer relapse

13:54.167 --> 13:55.802
because you refused
maintenance chemotherapy.

13:55.802 --> 13:57.104
I'm not gonna talk
about this.

13:57.104 --> 13:58.471
Recurrent GBM causes
much worse symptoms

13:58.471 --> 13:59.839
than temozolomide.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.508
That's the decision I made.

14:01.508 --> 14:05.078
I'm going crazy.
There are three
crib sets I like.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.947
I just can't decide.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.449
Could you guys go to the store
after work tonight

14:09.449 --> 14:10.850
and pick your fave?

14:13.820 --> 14:14.988
Okay.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.726
I have to go practice
the baby's surgery.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.030
I will see you after work.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.466
Oh, my God!

14:29.136 --> 14:30.370
Should I be worried?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.704
About me? No.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.051
We're going to kill him

14:44.051 --> 14:45.852
trying to save
the lobe of his lung.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.688
Removing it still leaves him
with 4/5ths capacity.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.991
When there's a chance
you might lose half your body,

14:50.991 --> 14:52.559
everything you
have left matters.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.898
I need
lobectomy instruments.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.736
This is my OR,
my department.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.338
My hospital.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.507
And when a doctor's judgment
is compromised,

15:07.507 --> 15:11.311
it's my responsibility
to step in and protect
our patients.

15:11.311 --> 15:14.081
In what possible way
am I compromised?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.953
Are you implying
that my time in a wheelchair
is affecting my objectivity?

15:21.221 --> 15:22.455
How could it not?

15:25.725 --> 15:26.926
This is my patient.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.529
And I'm your boss.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.274
You can either do this with me,
or I'll find someone who will.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.148
Deaver retractor.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.032
After they fix
the colon, Lim can use

16:05.032 --> 16:07.300
some preserved bowel
to create a new bladder

16:07.300 --> 16:08.768
like these Korean surgeons did.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.138
That would work perfectly
with what I found.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.206
We can bypass
all of the artery injuries

16:13.206 --> 16:14.941
through two Dacron conduits

16:14.941 --> 16:16.409
directly to his
lower extremities.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.745
And the improved blood flow
would help with my idea

16:18.745 --> 16:20.313
with his pelvis.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.149
So skin flaps,

16:22.149 --> 16:24.451
Dacron artery bypass,
neo-bladder,

16:24.451 --> 16:26.986
bowel repair
with biomaterials, and...

16:29.156 --> 16:33.393
a badass, Wolverine-like
adamantium skeleton.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.395
It's experimental,
but it's pretty damn cool.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.364
Now, how do we make sure
all this heals?

16:38.998 --> 16:40.667
There's one study in Canada.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.269
A cocktail of
recumbent growth hormones

16:42.269 --> 16:44.137
and pentoxifylline showed
a threefold increase

16:44.137 --> 16:45.372
in traumatic wound
healing rates.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.007
That's great.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.443
There's only four patients,

16:50.443 --> 16:51.811
and none of them had
the same injuries as Brady.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.247
So no one got cut in half

16:54.247 --> 16:55.915
with a metal sheet
on an oil rig?

16:55.915 --> 16:58.251
Great, I guess we just
toss that study out.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.220
I'm just saying,
I wish we had something better.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.291
I'll happily take
a threefold increase.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.025
This is a workable plan.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.360
Good, because Lim wants
an update.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.205
Some promising ideas,

17:18.205 --> 17:20.039
but there's a lot
of frail tissue to heal.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.876
I found a study
using growth hormones

17:23.876 --> 17:25.612
to accelerate the healing.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.180
Interesting.
Would that work here?

17:29.249 --> 17:31.318
There was a threefold plan
that we had--

17:31.318 --> 17:33.386
Well, hang on,
I want to hear from the guy
who did the research.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.858
I'm not confident it would.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.860
You guys said you had
a workable plan.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.462
It can work.
Jared's being overly cautious.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.331
If you close the pelvis
without good vascular support,

17:44.331 --> 17:45.898
all these repairs
will get necrotic.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.301
We will have good support.
The Dacron conduit to
restore blood flow--

17:48.301 --> 17:49.669
Not normal flow
and not quick enough.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.903
Oh, dude, you've been
doom and gloom from the start.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.105
- I've been--
- Enough.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.374
Find a way to heal him.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.876
I don't care who it comes from,
but I need it soon.

18:14.561 --> 18:17.297
The nurse said she's
responding to the medication.

18:18.965 --> 18:21.901
How long will Eden be in
the hospital after the surgery?

18:21.901 --> 18:23.503
Two weeks.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.072
Jasmine's on the wait list
for long-term housing.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.240
She might have a place by then.

18:29.276 --> 18:31.077
Also, uh,

18:32.245 --> 18:34.581
is this safe
if she keeps breastfeeding?

18:34.581 --> 18:35.782
The police found this
in her tent.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.519
This is a bipolar
mood stabilizer.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.320
It's safe.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.190
How long has she been
taking this?

18:43.190 --> 18:44.857
She saw her psychiatrist
for the first time in years

18:44.857 --> 18:46.359
about five weeks ago.

18:46.359 --> 18:49.362
She responded to it
in the past.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.964
She had a follow-up
scheduled with him tomorrow.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.572
There's another
treatment option for Eden.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.375
I know, I know.
It's disgusting.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.143
You're gonna think,
"What are the percentages?"

19:04.143 --> 19:06.313
Trust me,
you change his diapers

19:06.313 --> 19:07.780
and you are gonna
bond with your son.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.382
Okay, here is
the Angelic Dream Set.

19:09.382 --> 19:12.919
And be attentive to Lea.
Be extra attentive.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.387
She's gonna be sleep-deprived.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.955
You are gonna be
sleep-deprived.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.390
You're both gonna
want to lose it. Don't.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.559
This mattress is
very comfortable.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.161
This dark wood is
a little bit funereal.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.597
The baby won't care
about the color.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.334
It's all about
first impressions.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.436
It's a newborn, you know?
Clean slate.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.471
You want to surround it
with beautiful things.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.172
A stuffed, soft-- No,
you don't want to do that.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.741
That's a hazard.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.243
But these spinny things--
what do you call these?

19:36.243 --> 19:37.744
Mobiles, mobiles.

19:37.744 --> 19:39.412
You know, everywhere he looks,

19:39.412 --> 19:41.147
you want him
to be interested, stimulated.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.982
Beautiful sounds.
Beautiful music.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.817
Mozart. Joni Mitchell.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.986
If you want to talk
about something

19:46.986 --> 19:48.255
other than selecting a crib,

19:48.255 --> 19:49.589
it should be
brain cancer treatments.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.990
Oh my God!
I don't want to
think about that.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.191
I can't not think about it.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.027
In 12 hours,
we will have results--

19:55.027 --> 19:56.529
- Exactly.
- We should be prepared.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.732
Okay, Shaun, stop.
Just... just stop
for a second

20:02.168 --> 20:03.202
Sit down.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.239
Okay.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.380
If I have cancer,

20:17.149 --> 20:19.486
I'd be at stage four, right?

20:19.486 --> 20:22.121
There's no
miracle cure for that.

20:22.121 --> 20:24.991
You still haven't called
Dr. Chen in Cleveland.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.192
I read her paper.

20:26.192 --> 20:27.827
It doesn't work
with recurrent GBM.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.407
How can you think
about teddy bears
when you might be dying?

20:42.342 --> 20:45.244
If you're right, Shaun,

20:45.244 --> 20:47.780
then I won't be here
when your son is born.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.917
I won't be here to help you.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.589
We'll know when we know.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.797
I like the lighter wood.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.267
So do I.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.308
What else should I know
about diapers?

21:28.287 --> 21:29.456
Lung lobe is out.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.362
These segmental vessels
are damaged.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.263
Running 7-0 sutures
should fix them.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.699
Why bother?
The upper lobe is out.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.934
If we can get
Perez's Dacron graft to work,

21:41.934 --> 21:43.235
we could use them
to save his lower half.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.604
Very unlikely.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.072
The residents
are working on it.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.574
And obviously
not succeeding.

21:50.910 --> 21:51.978
First,
I'm compromised,

21:51.978 --> 21:53.413
now you're slagging
on the residents?

21:53.413 --> 21:55.548
Two are on probation,
you let another one go,

21:55.548 --> 21:57.316
and her replacement
is someone I fired.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.118
He's also the world's
most experienced first-year,

21:59.118 --> 22:00.487
and he brings a new perspective
to the mix.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.422
And training these guys
is my job.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.624
Your job is to make
my job easier.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.325
I thought
it was to run a great
surgical department.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.327
If you were doing that,
I wouldn't have to think

22:08.327 --> 22:10.196
about that department
as much as I have recently.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.100
Vessel loops.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.580
You changed
the baby's surgery?

22:27.580 --> 22:29.816
We weren't giving Jasmine
enough credit.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.350
She's done a lot
to turn her life around

22:31.350 --> 22:32.619
since Eden was born.

22:32.619 --> 22:34.421
For seven weeks.

22:34.421 --> 22:35.354
And with this new
treatment plan,

22:35.354 --> 22:37.123
she has to keep it up
for seven years.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.692
A baby can change a person.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.431
<i>Code pink, NICU bed three.</i>

22:44.431 --> 22:46.098
That's Eden.

22:46.098 --> 22:48.234
<i>Code pink, NICU bed three.</i>

22:59.045 --> 23:01.247
Lim asked for my opinion.

23:07.887 --> 23:12.525
I met so many rich, entitled
guys like you in college,

23:12.525 --> 23:14.527
and I couldn't stand them--

23:14.527 --> 23:15.528
even the ones I slept with.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.832
If you can't handle
the hard work,

23:19.832 --> 23:22.368
just get in your Lamborghini
and go home.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.405
Sherry Lewis.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.412
One of my last patients
in Denver.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.415
Late-stage ovarian cancer.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.250
Treatment's
pelvic exenteration.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.020
You remove everything.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.190
The bladder, colon,
uterus, and vagina.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.093
Now, in success,

23:47.093 --> 23:49.696
the patient lives
with colostomy
and urostomy bags,

23:49.696 --> 23:51.798
severe menopause,
and absolutely no sex life.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.468
Well, it's brutal
but effective.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.204
Would have been.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.409
But I talked my attending
out of it,

24:03.409 --> 24:06.012
in favor of
an experimental surgery.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.547
A wide excision
of all the tumors,

24:07.547 --> 24:10.249
then you reconstruct the entire
pelvic floor with TRAM flaps.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.450
Incredibly advanced.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.622
The type of stuff you're
talking about doing to Brady.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.629
Sherry, um...

24:27.066 --> 24:28.835
Sherry died on the table.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.007
And I left Denver.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.959
We take risks and people die.

24:55.361 --> 24:56.963
But if we play it safe,

24:59.532 --> 25:00.533
they die too.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.773
I'd rather regret
fighting too hard for a patient

25:06.773 --> 25:08.675
than not hard enough.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.929
Why would
your daughter
shave your cat?

25:29.929 --> 25:34.133
Long story.
Point being, don't get a cat.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.268
Kids are gonna tell you
they're gonna clean
the litter box.

25:36.268 --> 25:39.005
They're not gonna
clean the litter box.
Don't fall for that trap.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.373
You made a lot of mistakes.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.508
Yeah.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.377
It all boils down to

25:45.377 --> 25:47.313
Maddy's mom
basically raised her

25:47.313 --> 25:49.616
while I focused on work.

25:49.616 --> 25:52.184
You were a surgeon.
She was a real estate agent.

25:52.184 --> 25:53.620
I love surgery.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.521
I love poking around
in people's brains.

25:55.521 --> 25:57.556
It's very exciting.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.192
And I get to save some lives
while I'm at it.

26:00.192 --> 26:03.195
Saving lives
is very exciting.

26:03.195 --> 26:05.397
So were Maddy's first steps,
her first words,

26:05.397 --> 26:09.235
her first piano recital,
or so I heard.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.203
Work over family,
and that's what you get.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.005
You're not gonna make
the same mistakes.

26:14.373 --> 26:15.975
I don't think I will.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.010
We are very different people.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.183
Are we?

26:29.922 --> 26:33.726
I have learned some
very useful things from you.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.695
Well, right back at you.

26:42.568 --> 26:45.204
The baby needs surgery.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.773
The crib needs to be assembled.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.174
Go.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.776
But you chose work
way too often.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.678
When should I
prioritize family?

26:51.678 --> 26:53.245
When you
have a sick baby

26:53.245 --> 26:56.816
and a piece of furniture,
the sick baby wins
every time. Go.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.651
I got this.

27:10.663 --> 27:11.864
Serial debridement.

27:11.864 --> 27:14.233
Helps healing a little, but...

27:14.233 --> 27:16.568
it increases
infection risk a lot.

27:16.568 --> 27:17.670
Well, then I'm tapped out.

27:18.738 --> 27:19.806
Me too.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.275
I guess we should tell Lim.

27:24.243 --> 27:25.644
Lamborghinis.

27:27.279 --> 27:28.614
Lamborghinis.

27:29.916 --> 27:32.051
Now, most sports cars use
pressurized combustion

27:32.051 --> 27:33.886
to achieve
that kind of performance,
but not Lambos.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.054
No, no, no, no.

27:35.054 --> 27:36.455
To reduce engine wear,
they use vacuums

27:36.455 --> 27:38.090
to pour gas into the pistons.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.892
Now, Brady's organs won't heal

27:39.892 --> 27:40.927
because we can't get
enough flow to them,

27:40.927 --> 27:42.995
but if you force
more blood

27:42.995 --> 27:44.831
into the area, well,
then we cause lethally high

27:44.831 --> 27:48.100
abdominal compartment
pressure. So...

27:48.100 --> 27:51.070
Let's pull in the blood
passively by creating
a vacuum

27:51.070 --> 27:52.839
using internal suction devices.

27:57.143 --> 28:00.046
A low pressure system
with low tissue stress
is better for healing.

28:00.646 --> 28:01.647
That's...

28:03.315 --> 28:04.350
That's a brilliant idea.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.819
But it won't work.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.687
Not without blood
coming into the right areas.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.023
I need your help with that.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.693
Where do you need the blood?

28:21.667 --> 28:23.602
It's what we
proposed earlier,

28:23.602 --> 28:25.471
plus a healing plan
that Jared--

28:25.471 --> 28:26.572
I can read.

28:29.675 --> 28:30.910
Good work.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.482
It's four
experimental techniques

28:36.482 --> 28:39.919
rolled into
an eight-hour surgery
with lousy odds of success.

28:49.595 --> 28:50.897
Let's give it a try.

29:03.943 --> 29:06.378
Dacron conduits
are connected to the aorta.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.981
Do the anastomosis sites
look secure enough?

29:08.981 --> 29:10.817
Any weak spots in there
will move that metal.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.351
He'll bleed out.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.552
They know.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.888
On three.

29:15.888 --> 29:19.025
One, two, three.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.446
We have hemostasis.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.614
And good blood flow
through the conduits.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.383
Tissue's perfusing.

29:48.354 --> 29:51.423
Yes! Yes!

29:58.364 --> 30:00.666
Time to move on
to the pelvic fractures.

30:03.102 --> 30:06.906
This is much more important
than assembling a crib.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.707
But patients will
always need surgery,

30:08.707 --> 30:10.977
and my family will
always need attention.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.279
If there's no clear choice
between a patient

30:13.279 --> 30:16.048
and your family, pick the one
that's related to you.

30:16.048 --> 30:16.849
Hmm.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.388
Obviously, choose family
when you can,

30:22.388 --> 30:25.224
but sacrifice is
part of the job.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.259
That's a good point.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.895
But you are divorced.

30:28.895 --> 30:30.462
That is more sacrifice
than I want.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.932
Fair.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.634
Eden's O2 sat
just dropped a bit.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.003
I'm nowhere near her lungs.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.490
Turner syndrome causes
leaky vessels.

30:58.490 --> 31:01.093
The stress on Eden's body
is causing lymph fluid
to build up.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.761
We can drain it
with a chest tube.

31:02.761 --> 31:05.664
Her chest is so small,
you'd risk a collapsed lung
and pleural infection.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.635
I could clear the lung
with diuretics.

31:09.635 --> 31:12.871
The risks and benefits
of both treatments
are nearly identical.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.342
But that also means
it doesn't matter
which one we choose,

31:16.342 --> 31:17.876
which makes the choice easy.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.279
I find inserting chest tubes
particularly satisfying,

31:20.279 --> 31:21.747
so I will do that.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.722
The risks and benefits
of a boy and a girl
are nearly identical too.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.226
But girls kick ass.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.671
This implant's
gonna be a tight fit
around the cauda equina.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.140
The bioengineer's
mapping algorithm

31:48.140 --> 31:50.676
was designed
to optimize stability.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.311
Well,
Brady's not an algorithm.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.712
His nerves are gonna run
where they run.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.383
I'll set it in position.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.487
Nerve impingement.

32:01.487 --> 32:02.955
I'll expand
the narrowing with a rod.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.731
Wait, there's an alternate
algorithm that can fix that.

32:12.731 --> 32:15.401
Settle down,
Dr. Allen. I got this.

32:15.401 --> 32:18.270
That's $100,000
worth of tech,
and she's using a rod.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.777
Nerve activity flattening.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.982
One more minute.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.766
The old
cantilever maneuver.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.601
Nice work.

32:49.601 --> 32:50.769
Can't beat
the classics.

32:56.675 --> 33:00.012
Eden's surgery went well,
so I was hoping Jasmine might--

33:12.624 --> 33:13.792
V-fib.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.464
Ran a code for an hour, but...

33:20.832 --> 33:22.468
she'd just been
through too much.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.410
Vacuum devices
are in position.

33:31.410 --> 33:33.612
Let's see if they work.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.347
Keep
a close eye on his
intra-abdominal pressure.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.551
We have vacuum.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.154
IA pressure's okay.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.190
Time for
the tissue flaps.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.192
Looking good, Lambo.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.429
There's
a small spike in IA pressure.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.831
Increasing
vacuum suction.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.833
Still climbing.

33:57.836 --> 33:59.037
Pressure's
compressing his organs.

34:00.839 --> 34:02.108
He's getting ischemic.

34:02.108 --> 34:03.175
I'm going up to 55.

34:10.482 --> 34:11.517
He's in shock.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.821
I did this.

34:15.821 --> 34:18.090
You didn't do anything.
We're in this together.

34:22.861 --> 34:23.862
We need to amputate.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.297
Not yet.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.132
Audrey,
pressure's too high.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.333
<i>We're killing his organs.</i>

34:27.333 --> 34:28.267
I think he's wrong.

34:30.269 --> 34:31.703
Then fight for your patient.

34:37.008 --> 34:38.744
We need to amputate.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.482
Okay.
All right.

34:43.482 --> 34:44.916
We need
a Liston amputation knife,

34:44.916 --> 34:46.885
a bone saw, and a set
of 5 1/2-inch hemostats.

34:46.885 --> 34:49.721
He can handle 75.

34:49.721 --> 34:52.023
With
that kind of pressure,
he'll bleed out.

34:52.023 --> 34:53.359
Normally, yes.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.194
But the Dacron conduits
Dr. Perez chose

34:55.194 --> 34:57.062
are more rigid
than typical vessels.

34:57.062 --> 34:58.530
They'll hold up.

34:59.365 --> 35:00.132
Let's do it.

35:02.401 --> 35:06.071
I trust my residents, Marcus,
and I need you to trust me.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.114
Let's go to 75.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.804
Brady's family are here.

35:42.341 --> 35:44.042
Is my husband--

35:44.042 --> 35:45.143
The surgery was a success.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.214
It will be
a long recovery, but--

35:48.214 --> 35:49.147
Oh.

35:53.118 --> 35:56.021
Thank you for saving my dad.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.360
I'll take you to him.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.267
I should be dead on my feet,
but I just feel--

36:08.967 --> 36:10.302
- Awesome?
- Yeah.

36:17.476 --> 36:19.211
It's been 24 hours.

36:21.813 --> 36:22.948
Yeah.

36:29.788 --> 36:32.023
I just need a minute.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.660
A minute won't change
the results.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.195
No, it won't.

36:50.709 --> 36:54.713
No cancerous DNA detected.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.214
I was wrong!

36:57.182 --> 36:58.484
Yes, you were.

38:35.113 --> 38:36.982
The new
surgical robot is operational,

38:36.982 --> 38:39.150
and I just landed
the perfect nephrectomy

38:39.150 --> 38:40.586
for its inaugural run.

38:40.586 --> 38:41.753
Dibs.

38:41.753 --> 38:43.321
Ah, you did
the last cool case.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.290
This one's going to Dr. Murphy.

38:46.925 --> 38:49.194
This is cool.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.599
Dr. Park should take it.

38:53.599 --> 38:55.501
I have to finish
setting up our nursery.

39:07.779 --> 39:08.814
Hey.

39:11.983 --> 39:12.818
Good job today.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.186
Thanks.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.791
I've been
under the microscope

39:19.791 --> 39:22.394
with the board lately,
and I am stressed.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.501
Things were said that
probably shouldn't have been.

39:33.505 --> 39:35.707
Things weren't said.
You said them.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.483
If you don't trust me, fire me.

39:46.251 --> 39:48.920
And if you do,
then stay out of my way.

40:07.673 --> 40:08.674
Hey.

40:09.841 --> 40:10.876
Dalisay?

40:11.577 --> 40:12.744
The baby's upset.

40:12.744 --> 40:13.879
Her heart?

40:13.879 --> 40:15.581
No, everything's fine there.

40:15.581 --> 40:17.983
I just...
I think she needs
some company.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.885
I'll get to her when I can,
but I'm slammed.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.278
I'm here, Eden.

41:06.331 --> 41:07.933
You can open your eyes now.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.103
It's so sweet.

41:13.138 --> 41:14.673
The crib.

41:16.107 --> 41:17.375
The dresser.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.044
It's the Angelic Dream Set.

41:19.044 --> 41:20.411
The dark walnut was funereal,

41:20.411 --> 41:23.481
but it also came
in natural pine.

41:23.481 --> 41:27.252
Oh, our little peanut
is gonna love it.

41:28.286 --> 41:30.088
Oh.

41:32.257 --> 41:33.525
Whatcha got there?

41:35.260 --> 41:36.461
There are

41:37.095 --> 41:39.297
two screws missing.

41:40.465 --> 41:42.400
That is not good.

41:42.400 --> 41:45.336
No Biggie, Shaun.
It's just a couple screws.

41:45.336 --> 41:48.840
No, that means
Dr. Glassman missed a step.

41:53.545 --> 41:55.981
Dr. Glassman doesn't have
brain cancer,

41:57.649 --> 41:59.718
but there is something wrong
with his brain.
