WEBVTT

00:11.059 --> 00:13.368
Good afternoon, Betsy.
I'm listening.

00:13.645 --> 00:17.684
<i>Hi, Dr Crane. My husband wants to
take me on a cruise for our anniversary.</i>

00:19.651 --> 00:21.084
That sounds enchanting.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.392
<i>Except I keep having this dream
where I'm in a cabin,</i>

00:24.698 --> 00:27.895
<i>and I see a few drops of water,
it's starting to leak in.</i>

00:28.201 --> 00:32.512
<i>At first it's just a trickle, then
it's gushing, pouring water everywhere</i>

00:32.873 --> 00:36.502
<i>and there's nothing in the world
that I can do to stop it.</i>

00:36.835 --> 00:41.067
That's a very powerful image,
wouldn't you say so, Roz?

00:41.423 --> 00:42.617
Roz agrees.

00:42.841 --> 00:45.753
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Frasier Crane.

00:46.053 --> 00:49.568
Lilith, it's me, Roz Doyle.

00:49.890 --> 00:51.881
Yes, Frasier's fun-loving producer.

00:52.142 --> 00:55.259
Who's apparently been having
a bit too much fun... loving.

00:57.397 --> 01:00.787
I'd love to send one back at you,
but I've got to pee.

01:02.569 --> 01:05.037
Well, that's all the time
we have for today.

01:05.322 --> 01:08.917
This is Dr Frasier Crane wishing you
a good day and good mental...

01:13.246 --> 01:17.398
I'm sorry. Someone just walked in
the room and frightened me. My ex-wife.

01:17.751 --> 01:21.460
If you're a regular listener,
you know what I'm talking about.

01:21.797 --> 01:23.788
We'll see you Monday.

01:24.883 --> 01:26.601
Hello, Lilith.

01:27.219 --> 01:30.052
- Surprise.
- We're a little past that now.

01:31.098 --> 01:33.089
What brings you to Seattle?

01:33.350 --> 01:37.309
The National Conference
on Self-Psychology.

01:37.646 --> 01:40.638
- How is Frederick?
- Fine. We have an amazing child.

01:40.941 --> 01:42.738
Yes, we have.

01:42.985 --> 01:47.297
- And Brian?
- Fine. I have an amazing husband.

01:48.156 --> 01:51.865
So, did you two get the gift basket
I sent you for the holidays?

01:52.202 --> 01:54.193
What did you do to her?

01:54.454 --> 01:57.924
Nothing. I sent her a gift basket.
Fruits and festive nuts.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.048
No, it's not the basket, you nit.

02:01.336 --> 02:04.931
It's Brian. He left me.

02:06.550 --> 02:08.541
Maybe I should go.

02:08.801 --> 02:12.317
No, everyone else knows it.
You might as well know it, too.

02:12.639 --> 02:16.871
Brian was looking for someone
a bit more... feminine.

02:18.603 --> 02:21.163
And he found him.

02:26.903 --> 02:29.781
Stan Jablonsky, that little hussy.

02:32.617 --> 02:34.972
Oh, Lilith...

02:35.704 --> 02:38.093
I am genuinely sorry.

02:38.373 --> 02:42.252
I didn't know where to turn but I knew
somehow you would be here for me.

02:43.879 --> 02:47.235
- So you didn't come for the conference?
- No.

02:47.549 --> 02:49.744
You shouldn't be alone tonight.

02:50.010 --> 02:53.639
Niles and I are going to the Union Club.
Would you like to join us?

02:56.600 --> 02:59.398
Thank you, Frasier. I'd love to.

02:59.686 --> 03:02.405
I don't know if I deserve
your compassion,

03:02.689 --> 03:07.080
but I feel better already just holding
your strong, comforting hands.

03:10.030 --> 03:12.590
You know, I'll always be here for you.

03:13.325 --> 03:15.919
I could stay in these arms all day.

03:22.751 --> 03:26.426
You'll have to excuse me.
I have an appointment.

03:26.755 --> 03:29.633
Station manager.
Very important. Can't be broken.

03:29.925 --> 03:33.315
I'll see you tonight. Bye-bye.

03:40.143 --> 03:42.941
That's rough,
leaving you for another man.

03:43.230 --> 03:45.949
- Did you have any idea?
- No, none at all.

03:46.233 --> 03:49.908
Stan was a contractor
we'd hired to expand our master bedroom.

03:50.237 --> 03:53.707
It's ironic, isn't it? No sooner
do I get the closet of my dreams

03:54.032 --> 03:56.421
than my husband comes out of it.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:05.585 --> 04:07.894
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier.

04:08.171 --> 04:11.720
- That bun looks good.
- Remember your diet.

04:12.050 --> 04:15.520
Speaking of buns I could do without,
Lilith is back.

04:17.264 --> 04:21.815
That explains why blood was pouring
from all my faucets this morning.

04:24.396 --> 04:27.706
Go easy on her.
Her husband has left her.

04:28.025 --> 04:30.823
And get this... for a man.

04:31.111 --> 04:33.227
Damn. I owe Dad five dollars.

04:40.329 --> 04:43.719
She's devastated.
Her world's been turned upside down.

04:44.041 --> 04:47.795
But you know better than anyone
how a messy divorce can leave one...

04:52.716 --> 04:54.866
...strangely relaxed.

04:55.135 --> 04:57.603
- Niles?
- Yes.

04:57.888 --> 05:02.040
- Am I boring you?
- Did I do it again? I'm sorry, Frasier.

05:02.392 --> 05:04.701
I'm suffering a bout of narcolepsy.

05:04.978 --> 05:08.334
Good Lord. When did this start?

05:08.649 --> 05:12.562
After we started divorce proceedings.
I checked with my doctor.

05:12.903 --> 05:17.294
It's a reaction to stress.
My way of escaping the whole ugly mess.

05:17.658 --> 05:19.649
Go on with what you were saying.

05:19.910 --> 05:22.549
Lilith is distraught
and she's come to me

05:22.829 --> 05:27.027
to help her make sense of it.
I find it just a bit disconcerting.

05:27.376 --> 05:29.810
- How so?
- We have a destructive pattern.

05:30.087 --> 05:33.841
Whenever she comes to me in need,
I find her vulnerability desirable.

05:34.174 --> 05:37.052
We end up in bed
and I'm left with feelings of regret.

05:37.344 --> 05:40.780
- And you felt this way about her today?
- Oh, baby!

05:43.517 --> 05:45.872
Well, do your best to avoid her.

05:46.144 --> 05:50.023
- She's coming to the Union Club.
- What? She's going to be there?

05:50.357 --> 05:55.033
It's a bunch of stuffed shirts talking
about their portfolios and prostates.

05:55.404 --> 05:58.396
Exactly, and you've ruined it.
Excuse me.

05:58.699 --> 06:02.738
Yes? Damn.
It's one of Maris' cadre of lawyers.

06:05.247 --> 06:08.284
We've been over that.
No, I can't.

06:08.583 --> 06:11.017
How dare you? She already has the house.

06:11.294 --> 06:13.683
I'm not even allowed
to visit the koi pond.

06:19.469 --> 06:20.458
Niles.

06:20.679 --> 06:22.829
I'm not even allowed
to visit the koi pond.

06:23.098 --> 06:24.611
Give me that!

06:24.850 --> 06:26.841
He will call you back.

06:27.686 --> 06:31.679
Aren't we a pair? A narcoleptic
and a weak-willed sexual obsessive.

06:32.024 --> 06:35.494
We look like a couple of brothers
out of an O'Neill play.

06:37.279 --> 06:41.158
Come on, boy. Daph, come down here.
I taught him a new trick.

06:41.491 --> 06:43.607
I was reading in a movie magazine

06:43.869 --> 06:47.305
there's a stunt dog
they taught to ride a motorcycle

06:47.622 --> 06:49.817
into a burning building, pick up a baby

06:50.083 --> 06:53.280
then jump out the window to safety.
What did you teach Eddie?

06:55.255 --> 06:57.485
To roll over.

06:57.758 --> 06:59.794
You must be very proud.

07:01.678 --> 07:03.828
Forget it, Eddie.

07:05.932 --> 07:07.923
- Hey, Niles.
- Evening, Dad. Daphne.

07:08.185 --> 07:11.461
Hello, Niles. Sherry?
We have time before Lilith arrives.

07:11.772 --> 07:17.051
- You never said she was coming here.
- You said you were going to dinner.

07:17.444 --> 07:20.277
It's just to rendezvous.
It's all of two minutes.

07:20.572 --> 07:24.042
You never told me.
Not a word. Did he say anything to you?

07:24.368 --> 07:27.440
No. We could
have made plans to be elsewhere.

07:27.746 --> 07:31.659
How come you didn't know about it?
You used to know these things.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.912
All right, she's coming.
Both of you, suck it up.

07:36.213 --> 07:39.922
Lilith has had a devastating week.
Her husband has left her.

07:40.258 --> 07:43.853
Show a little compassion,
unless you'd like to hide in your rooms

07:44.179 --> 07:48.536
if two minutes of polite conversation
with her is too much to ask.

07:48.892 --> 07:51.850
- Out of my way.
- Me, too.

07:52.145 --> 07:53.578
Leave it!

07:58.026 --> 08:01.860
Remember, I'm here for you
if you feel yourself starting to weaken.

08:02.197 --> 08:06.509
I'm fine. Believe me,
I am in complete control.

08:07.953 --> 08:09.671
Oh, baby.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.849
Thank you, Frasier. I needed that.

08:14.126 --> 08:18.165
I treated myself to a little shopping.
Probably just a pathetic attempt

08:18.505 --> 08:21.622
to compensate for the battering
my ego's taken recently.

08:21.925 --> 08:26.919
- It's pretty transparent, huh?
- No, but if you stand in the light...

08:29.933 --> 08:33.369
Niles, sorry to hear
your marriage ended in a shambles.

08:33.687 --> 08:36.042
Ditto.

08:39.025 --> 08:43.258
Now that we've got the pleasantries
out of the way, let me take your wrap.

08:44.865 --> 08:46.059
Yowsa!

08:46.283 --> 08:48.717
Lilith, that dress is stunning.

08:48.994 --> 08:52.066
- Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen?
- No.

08:53.707 --> 08:57.461
It's from a new couture line
called Encore.

08:57.794 --> 09:01.548
Bravo.
I can almost feel the curtain rising.

09:01.882 --> 09:05.397
Frasier. Excuse us, we'll be right back.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.710
Eddie will entertain you.

09:10.849 --> 09:12.487
Hello, Eddie.

09:15.312 --> 09:18.941
Damn her. She knows
what she's doing dressing like that.

09:19.274 --> 09:22.869
The woman plays me like a lute.
I guess you know about that.

09:23.195 --> 09:27.313
I've got all the resistance of a horny
stag. Niles, you've got to help me.

09:27.658 --> 09:28.773
Niles?

09:34.373 --> 09:38.491
- Did I do it again?
- With your cheek against the ice tray.

09:38.835 --> 09:41.907
That's so strange.
I dreamt I was tangoing with Maris.

09:44.508 --> 09:47.580
I need your help resisting Lilith.

09:47.886 --> 09:51.162
All right, let me think.
I think I have the answer.

09:51.890 --> 09:54.199
When you feel yourself yielding to her,

09:54.476 --> 09:59.266
summon an image so repellent you'll
be incapable of any sexual desire.

09:59.648 --> 10:03.880
Remember at Uncle Henry's farm we
found that dead horse lying in the sun,

10:04.236 --> 10:06.466
- crawling with maggots?
- Yes, of course.

10:06.738 --> 10:09.935
Hold on to that picture.
You can ride that horse to safety.

10:11.493 --> 10:14.132
Thank you, Niles.
That might just do the trick.

10:14.413 --> 10:17.610
When it comes to an ugly image,
you can't beat a dead horse.

10:21.962 --> 10:23.998
Feel up to facing her again?

10:24.256 --> 10:26.531
Yes. Let her bat her eyes
all she wants to.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.633
She can push her breasts up to Canada.
I won't budge.

10:39.980 --> 10:40.969
Morning.

10:43.066 --> 10:44.055
Morning.

11:03.128 --> 11:06.643
My God. What did we do?
What did we do?

11:07.924 --> 11:11.234
- First you put your...
- I know what we did. What do we do now?

11:12.846 --> 11:16.555
Let's try to stay calm. These things
happen. They happen every day.

11:17.976 --> 11:19.967
Every day in Arkansas.

11:25.776 --> 11:28.415
Frasier is going to kill us.

11:28.695 --> 11:31.255
Why did you
have to look so bewitching?

11:31.531 --> 11:34.125
Why did you have to drive me home?

11:34.409 --> 11:38.925
There's no point in pointing fingers.
We both know why this happened.

11:39.289 --> 11:44.727
Last night was two wounded people
overcome with loneliness and confusion

11:45.128 --> 11:47.562
- and...
- Tequila shooters.

11:50.342 --> 11:53.254
- Who's that?
- Don't panic. No one knows we're here.

11:53.553 --> 11:57.546
- I told Frasier I was driving you home.
- Why do a stupid thing like that?

11:57.891 --> 12:00.359
It wasn't stupid at the time.
How did I know

12:00.644 --> 12:04.080
when we got in this room you'd
be on me like a hawk on a titmouse?

12:06.858 --> 12:08.894
Just be quiet.

12:09.152 --> 12:11.268
- Who is it?
- Room service, ma'am.

12:11.530 --> 12:14.886
That's right.
We ordered breakfast last night.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.191
Good morning, ma'am.
Morning, sir.

12:17.452 --> 12:20.012
I have eggs Benedict
and eggs Florentine.

12:20.288 --> 12:23.086
- Did you bring ketchup?
- No. I'm sorry.

12:23.375 --> 12:26.890
- Let me get that for you right now.
- Ketchup on eggs Florentine?

12:27.212 --> 12:30.010
- Your first breakfast together?
- Just get it.

12:33.593 --> 12:35.709
Now I remember ordering this.

12:35.971 --> 12:39.202
It's the breakfast I always have
after a night of passion.

12:39.516 --> 12:43.634
- Eggs Benedict? That's very rich.
- I only have it once a year.

12:49.860 --> 12:52.135
- That was quick.
- Lilith, are you awake?

12:52.404 --> 12:55.282
It's Frasier. Just a second.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.008
- What do we do?
- Hide in the bathroom.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.529
No, not you.

13:03.790 --> 13:06.179
Wait a minute. Wait.
Take the cart with you.

13:06.460 --> 13:09.020
Wait. Food in the bathroom?

13:12.424 --> 13:13.413
Lilith?

13:16.178 --> 13:18.453
Hello, Frasier. What are you doing here?

13:18.722 --> 13:21.077
Surrendering, Lilith. I'm yours.

13:21.350 --> 13:23.466
- No, Frasier.
- Please don't punish me

13:23.727 --> 13:27.959
for playing hard-to-get last night.
It was everything I had to resist you.

13:28.315 --> 13:29.668
This isn't right.

13:29.900 --> 13:34.098
Can you say that in bed last night
you weren't thinking about me?

13:34.446 --> 13:35.435
Yes.

13:36.281 --> 13:39.398
Drop the mask, Lilith.
We both know why you came to Seattle.

13:39.701 --> 13:43.376
We both know why you dressed
so enticingly last night.

13:50.045 --> 13:53.242
- Is someone in your bathroom?
- No. It's a defective toilet.

13:53.548 --> 13:57.780
It's been doing that all night.
I think I'll just go check it right now.

14:01.223 --> 14:03.339
- Niles.
- Yes?

14:03.600 --> 14:05.875
You fell asleep and flushed the toilet.

14:06.144 --> 14:07.975
Damn. Is he still here?

14:08.230 --> 14:12.382
- Yes. He wants to make love to me.
- Does the man have no scruples?

14:15.028 --> 14:17.781
He asked me last night
to keep him away from you.

14:18.073 --> 14:22.146
The minute my back is turned, he sneaks
here, yes, I'm aware of the irony.

14:22.577 --> 14:24.568
I'll just ask him to leave.

14:28.709 --> 14:31.746
- My God.
- My goddess.

14:37.801 --> 14:40.190
- Room service.
- Go away.

14:40.470 --> 14:43.428
- I have your ketchup, ma'am.
- Not necessary.

14:43.724 --> 14:46.443
- OK, but I need the bill.
- Later.

14:46.727 --> 14:48.604
Let's just take care of this.

14:50.772 --> 14:53.969
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Here's the ketchup.

14:54.276 --> 14:56.346
Sorry it took so... long.

14:58.488 --> 15:01.002
I still need the bill.

15:01.283 --> 15:03.274
Where's the cart?

15:05.162 --> 15:08.552
- In the bathroom.
- Why is it in the bathroom?

15:08.874 --> 15:12.264
I was going to take a hot bath
while I ate.

15:12.586 --> 15:15.259
Still, food in the bathroom.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.562
Be right back.

15:22.304 --> 15:25.376
Well, this is a little embarrassing.

15:25.682 --> 15:29.072
My ex-wife. We're sort of reconnecting.

15:29.394 --> 15:32.466
Yes, sir, that's wonderful.

15:32.773 --> 15:34.923
It may just work out this time.

15:35.734 --> 15:36.723
OK.

15:39.863 --> 15:43.412
There you go. There's a generous,
generous tip in there for you.

15:43.742 --> 15:44.731
Thank you, ma'am.

15:44.951 --> 15:48.307
Why don't you
send up an order of eggs Benedict?

15:48.622 --> 15:51.420
No reason why she should eat alone.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.069
OK.

15:56.838 --> 15:58.317
Now, where were we?

15:58.548 --> 16:01.824
- This isn't a good time for this.
- Why not, Lilith?

16:02.135 --> 16:05.252
Please, we're alone. We're here.
You need your Frasier.

16:08.016 --> 16:10.849
- What the hell was that?
- Wait! No, don't go in there.

16:12.437 --> 16:14.667
- Niles.
- Yes?

16:15.524 --> 16:16.513
My God!

16:17.859 --> 16:21.738
- Frasier, I'm sorry.
- Frasier, it was a mistake.

16:22.072 --> 16:25.826
Stop it, Niles. Don't tell me how it
was. I've just got to get out of here.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.797
Frasier, you...

16:28.745 --> 16:31.703
- This is my worst nightmare.
- You have egg on your face.

16:31.999 --> 16:35.355
- That is an understatement.
- No, actual egg.

16:39.339 --> 16:41.409
It's in your hair, too.

16:41.675 --> 16:45.748
- I knew you couldn't stay mad at us.
- I'm in a bathrobe, you jackass.

16:48.598 --> 16:54.070
I can understand your shock and
if I could erase last night, I would.

16:54.479 --> 16:58.518
But if you could just look at this
rationally, just for a moment.

16:58.859 --> 17:01.612
We didn't technically do anything wrong.

17:01.903 --> 17:05.373
What? You didn't do anything wrong?

17:05.699 --> 17:10.011
I'm a little unclear on that myself,
but I'm willing to go along with it.

17:10.369 --> 17:13.167
You are I are no longer married.
Neither is Niles.

17:13.457 --> 17:15.448
I won't say this is my shining hour,

17:15.709 --> 17:19.145
but we are not responsible to you
or anyone else for our actions.

17:19.463 --> 17:22.772
- You're defending what you did?
- Just listen.

17:23.090 --> 17:26.446
The past few days
have been the worst of my life.

17:26.762 --> 17:30.516
I have never been less self-assured,
more in need of validation,

17:30.849 --> 17:33.079
both as a person
and especially as a woman.

17:33.352 --> 17:36.264
- Niles was feeling the same thing.
- Exactly.

17:36.563 --> 17:38.554
Wait a minute.

17:38.815 --> 17:41.010
Our physical reaction to each other

17:41.276 --> 17:46.908
was nothing more than a desperate
attempt to reaffirm our own worth.

17:49.284 --> 17:51.923
That is very impressive, Dr Sternin.

17:53.497 --> 17:55.692
But I, too, happen to be a psychiatrist.

17:55.957 --> 17:59.074
Let me tell you
what actually transpired.

17:59.378 --> 18:02.176
This was a passive-aggressive
manifestation

18:02.464 --> 18:04.694
of your deep resentments toward me.

18:04.967 --> 18:07.640
Niles, you were punishing me
for my notoriety.

18:07.928 --> 18:11.125
You, for my successful adjustment
after our divorce.

18:11.431 --> 18:14.070
It is this shared bond
that brought the two of you

18:14.351 --> 18:16.581
to your palace of sweet revenge.

18:16.853 --> 18:19.765
Allow me to rebut: What a crock.

18:20.065 --> 18:21.544
- It is not.
- It is so.

18:21.775 --> 18:26.610
It's an example of your self-absorption
which is why we could not stay together.

18:26.989 --> 18:30.186
I have a right to...
Why am I defending myself?

18:30.492 --> 18:32.608
If you ask me,
you are both off the mark.

18:32.869 --> 18:37.226
Last night was about two people
ruled by very powerful superegos,

18:37.582 --> 18:40.938
tortured by them,
who found a chance, however misguided,

18:41.253 --> 18:44.529
to break through and rediscover
their ids together.

18:44.840 --> 18:47.957
Call me an old softy,
but that's how I see it.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.854
OK, then.

18:54.224 --> 18:59.503
The three of us have certainly
analysed the crap out of this.

19:01.398 --> 19:04.390
Yes, where do we all go from here?

19:05.902 --> 19:07.494
I don't know.

19:10.824 --> 19:13.418
That's my cell phone.
It's in my jacket pocket.

19:17.956 --> 19:20.629
If you had given in to me last night

19:20.917 --> 19:25.229
instead of this morning, the
three of us would not be in this hell.

19:25.589 --> 19:28.467
No, it would be the two of us
in a whole different hell.

19:28.759 --> 19:33.355
I've been manipulated by you jackals
enough. I'll see you in court.

19:34.389 --> 19:37.620
The very idea that Maris
still thinks she can...

19:39.519 --> 19:43.592
I'm not sleeping. That conversation
should have put me out like a light.

19:43.940 --> 19:48.058
It's not surprising. Your experience
with Maris has been emasculating.

19:48.403 --> 19:52.919
Last night may have gone a long way
toward restoring your self-confidence.

19:53.283 --> 19:55.797
Of course. And by the same token,

19:56.078 --> 19:59.036
you can now give up the assumption
that Brian left you

19:59.331 --> 20:02.846
because you're unattractive.
You have evidence to the contrary.

20:03.168 --> 20:05.079
Yes, I have. To hell with Brian.

20:05.337 --> 20:08.170
If he wants a prissy little wife,
he can keep Stan.

20:09.716 --> 20:12.276
Isn't this peachy?

20:14.179 --> 20:18.013
Everything's turned out fine.
You two have solved your problems.

20:18.350 --> 20:22.662
The waiter received a handsome tip.
Niles and I have matching bathrobes.

20:23.021 --> 20:25.137
And it's not even 9.30 yet.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.844
Frasier, try to understand.

20:31.113 --> 20:35.584
- What happened last night was...
- Stop it, both of you. Enough.

20:35.951 --> 20:38.909
It happened and I'm just
going to have to deal with it.

20:39.204 --> 20:43.163
I suppose in a twisted way
there is one positive for me in this.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.617
You see, Lilith,
I have never stopped desiring you,

20:46.920 --> 20:49.832
even though I know
we are wrong for each other.

20:50.132 --> 20:54.364
But now, from this day forward,
whenever I look at your face,

20:54.720 --> 20:57.518
I will see the back
of my brother's head.

21:00.517 --> 21:04.112
And that is one bucket of ice water,
let me tell you.

21:06.023 --> 21:08.537
- You know, Frasier...
- Enough, Lilith.

21:13.488 --> 21:15.479
Maybe I'll just go...

21:17.075 --> 21:19.066
...have some breakfast.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.574
Are we OK?

21:27.419 --> 21:29.330
No, we're not.

21:31.715 --> 21:33.512
But we will be.

21:34.551 --> 21:37.145
Well, that's enough for now.

21:40.057 --> 21:42.366
We're an odd little family, aren't we?

21:46.647 --> 21:48.638
Room service.

21:51.860 --> 21:54.499
Here's your eggs Benedict.
If you could just...

22:01.703 --> 22:02.692
OK.
