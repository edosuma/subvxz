03:18.229 --> 03:19.308
Sir.

03:19.397 --> 03:20.891
General.

03:31.534 --> 03:32.649
Sir.

03:47.633 --> 03:49.258
Lean and hungry.

03:52.513 --> 03:55.218
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

03:55.308 --> 03:58.843
How long has he been gone?
Nearly two hours.

04:01.189 --> 04:02.980
Will they fight, sir?

04:03.066 --> 04:04.524
We shall know soon enough.

04:04.609 --> 04:07.278
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

04:07.361 --> 04:09.687
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

04:11.240 --> 04:14.656
- The danger to the cavalry...
- Is acceptable. Agreed?

04:24.337 --> 04:25.582
They say no.

04:51.364 --> 04:53.902
People should know
when they're conquered.

05:04.377 --> 05:06.168
Would you, Quintus?

05:07.088 --> 05:08.368
Would I?

05:25.106 --> 05:27.811
Strength and honor.

05:33.448 --> 05:36.567
At my signal, unleash hell.

05:59.307 --> 06:00.849
Load the catapults.

06:01.726 --> 06:03.683
Infantry form up for advance.

06:05.146 --> 06:07.554
Archers ready.
Archers!

06:07.648 --> 06:09.107
Nock!

06:32.924 --> 06:34.299
<i>Fratres!</i>

06:34.384 --> 06:36.341
Maximus!

06:37.428 --> 06:41.508
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

06:41.849 --> 06:46.310
Imagine where you will be, and it will be so.

06:47.021 --> 06:50.355
Hold the line! Stay with me!

06:50.441 --> 06:53.111
If you find yourself alone...

06:53.194 --> 06:56.195
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face...

06:57.448 --> 06:59.571
do not be troubled.

07:00.410 --> 07:04.075
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

07:06.207 --> 07:07.867
Brothers...

07:09.252 --> 07:11.079
what we do in life...

07:12.171 --> 07:14.128
echoes in eternity.

07:22.306 --> 07:23.587
Pull!

07:39.198 --> 07:41.238
Catapults ready, sir!

07:51.961 --> 07:54.286
Archers, ignite!

07:54.380 --> 07:57.002
Ignite!

08:03.014 --> 08:05.683
Archers, draw!

08:09.187 --> 08:10.515
Loose!

08:39.759 --> 08:41.917
All right, men, ready!

08:47.517 --> 08:49.426
Hold the line!

08:57.693 --> 08:59.816
Loose!

08:59.904 --> 09:01.363
Reload!

09:06.369 --> 09:08.361
Hold the line!

09:08.454 --> 09:10.826
- Draw!
- Loose!

09:13.376 --> 09:15.167
Stay with me!

09:20.508 --> 09:22.714
Stay with me!

09:50.705 --> 09:53.575
<i>Roma victor!</i>

12:26.611 --> 12:28.603
<i>Roma victor!</i>

13:10.905 --> 13:13.443
Do you think he's really dying?

13:14.325 --> 13:16.318
He's been dying for 10 years.

13:17.745 --> 13:20.746
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

13:20.832 --> 13:22.741
Maybe he just misses us.

13:22.834 --> 13:25.503
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if...

13:25.586 --> 13:26.749
Peace, Commodus.

13:26.838 --> 13:30.882
After two weeks on the road,
your incessant scheming is hurting my head.

13:38.307 --> 13:41.723
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

13:45.356 --> 13:47.265
He will name me.

13:50.153 --> 13:53.771
The first thing I shall do when...

13:56.576 --> 13:59.861
Is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

13:59.954 --> 14:04.782
For now, the first thing I shall do
is have a hot bath.

14:06.544 --> 14:08.287
Your Highness?

14:12.091 --> 14:14.582
We seem to be almost there, sire.

14:20.391 --> 14:22.467
Sire.
Where's the Emperor?

14:22.560 --> 14:25.727
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

14:26.272 --> 14:28.514
<i>The wounded are still coming in.</i>

14:28.608 --> 14:30.232
My horse.

14:30.318 --> 14:31.978
My lord.

14:35.531 --> 14:36.611
Kiss?

15:12.485 --> 15:15.984
You have proved your valor yet again,
Maximus.

15:18.241 --> 15:20.945
Let us hope, for the last time.

15:21.327 --> 15:23.652
There's no one left to fight, sire.

15:23.746 --> 15:26.237
There is always someone left to fight.

15:26.457 --> 15:29.375
How can I reward Rome's greatest general?

15:34.841 --> 15:36.335
Let me go home.

15:38.970 --> 15:40.168
Home.

15:58.948 --> 16:00.526
They honor you, Caesar.

16:00.616 --> 16:03.404
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

16:26.392 --> 16:29.097
Have I missed it? Have I missed the battle?

16:30.772 --> 16:32.563
You have missed the war.

16:32.648 --> 16:34.855
Father, congratulations.

16:35.318 --> 16:37.725
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.

16:37.820 --> 16:39.480
Save the bulls.

16:39.572 --> 16:42.028
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

16:42.450 --> 16:44.775
General.
Highness.

16:45.787 --> 16:49.405
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

16:49.499 --> 16:51.290
It has been too long, my old friend.

16:51.376 --> 16:52.751
Highness.

16:52.877 --> 16:55.450
Here, Father. Take my arm.

16:57.048 --> 17:00.251
I think it is time for me to leave.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.733
So much for the glory of Rome.

18:47.950 --> 18:49.575
Magnificent battle.

19:13.518 --> 19:15.226
General. Still alive?

19:15.311 --> 19:16.592
Still alive.

19:16.687 --> 19:18.312
The gods must have a sense of humor.

19:18.398 --> 19:21.067
The gods must love you.
Valerius.

19:21.150 --> 19:23.937
Back to barracks, General? Or to Rome?

19:24.070 --> 19:27.190
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

19:27.824 --> 19:31.157
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

19:31.244 --> 19:34.826
You know, dirt cleans off
a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

19:34.914 --> 19:37.037
- Here he is.
- Highness.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.283
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

19:39.377 --> 19:42.331
Beware of Gaius.
He'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear...

19:42.422 --> 19:45.921
and you'll wake up one day and all
you'll say is, Republic."

19:46.008 --> 19:48.678
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

19:48.761 --> 19:51.383
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

19:51.472 --> 19:53.963
But Senator Gaius
isn't influenced by that, of course.

19:54.058 --> 19:56.680
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?

19:56.769 --> 20:01.597
A soldier has the advantage of being able
to look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

20:02.024 --> 20:05.939
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

20:06.028 --> 20:09.113
I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.411
Maximus.

20:21.544 --> 20:24.000
I'm going to need good men like you.

20:26.132 --> 20:28.670
How may I be of service, Highness?

20:28.760 --> 20:31.381
You're a man who knows what it is
to command.

20:31.888 --> 20:35.173
You give your orders, the orders are obeyed,
and the battle is won.

20:35.266 --> 20:40.058
But these senators scheme, squabble
and flatter and deceive.

20:40.605 --> 20:43.559
We must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

20:43.649 --> 20:46.734
Can I count on you when the time comes?

20:52.575 --> 20:55.611
Highness, when your father releases me,
I intend to return home.

20:55.703 --> 20:58.906
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

21:00.416 --> 21:04.200
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

21:06.255 --> 21:08.829
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

21:09.384 --> 21:11.293
She's not forgotten you.

21:12.595 --> 21:14.718
And now, you're the great man.

21:27.235 --> 21:29.726
If only you had been born a man...

21:30.822 --> 21:33.063
what a Caesar you would have made.

21:34.742 --> 21:36.201
Father.

21:42.041 --> 21:44.034
You would have been strong.

21:44.127 --> 21:47.330
I wonder, would you have been just?

21:48.297 --> 21:50.919
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

21:52.885 --> 21:54.428
How was your journey?

21:54.512 --> 21:58.676
Long. Uncomfortable. Why have I come?

21:58.850 --> 22:01.471
I need your help. With your brother.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.597
Of course.

22:03.688 --> 22:05.846
He loves you. He always has.

22:06.858 --> 22:08.020
And...

22:09.944 --> 22:13.111
he will need you now, more than ever.

22:18.161 --> 22:20.034
Enough of politics.

22:20.371 --> 22:23.372
Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter...

22:23.791 --> 22:26.163
and I am a good father.

22:31.758 --> 22:34.509
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

22:47.398 --> 22:49.023
Good morning.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.535
I need three more horses.

23:14.842 --> 23:16.835
<i>Two! Three!</i>

23:17.512 --> 23:18.757
Four!

23:18.846 --> 23:21.516
One! Two!

23:37.323 --> 23:39.482
You sent for me, Caesar?

23:44.080 --> 23:46.915
- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.708
Why are we here?

23:51.003 --> 23:53.541
For the glory of the empire, sire.

23:54.006 --> 23:55.086
Yes.

23:57.093 --> 23:59.086
Yes, I remember.

24:02.140 --> 24:04.381
Do you see that map, Maximus?

24:05.184 --> 24:07.722
That is the world which I created.

24:08.604 --> 24:10.182
<i>For 25 years...</i>

24:10.773 --> 24:14.641
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

24:16.028 --> 24:19.860
Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.

24:19.949 --> 24:22.405
Four years of peace in 20.

24:22.702 --> 24:24.196
<i>And for what?</i>

24:31.627 --> 24:35.411
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

24:36.716 --> 24:37.996
Caesar, your life...

24:38.092 --> 24:40.666
Please. Please don't call me that.

24:40.928 --> 24:43.217
Come. Please.

24:44.015 --> 24:45.390
Come sit.

24:46.225 --> 24:48.930
<i>Let us talk together now...</i>

24:49.812 --> 24:51.935
<i>very simply, as men.</i>

24:52.607 --> 24:54.434
Well, Maximus...

24:56.819 --> 24:57.982
talk.

25:00.948 --> 25:03.819
5,000 of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.

25:04.035 --> 25:07.534
3,000 of them are bloodied and cleaved.
2,000 will never leave this place.

25:07.622 --> 25:10.658
I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.374
And what would you believe?

25:12.460 --> 25:16.292
They fought for you and for Rome.

25:16.381 --> 25:18.172
And what is Rome, Maximus?

25:20.343 --> 25:22.750
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

25:22.845 --> 25:26.843
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

25:26.933 --> 25:28.842
Yet you have never been there.

25:28.935 --> 25:31.342
You have not seen what it has become.

25:31.479 --> 25:34.515
I am dying, Maximus.

25:35.191 --> 25:36.851
<i>When a man sees his end...</i>

25:36.943 --> 25:40.027
<i>he wants to know there was some purpose
to his life.</i>

25:40.696 --> 25:43.816
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

25:43.950 --> 25:46.238
Will I be known as the philosopher?

25:46.327 --> 25:47.786
The warrior?

25:48.121 --> 25:49.531
The tyrant?

25:50.957 --> 25:55.583
Or will I be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?

25:56.671 --> 25:58.960
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

25:59.048 --> 26:01.883
You could only whisper it.

26:01.968 --> 26:05.134
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish...

26:05.221 --> 26:06.964
it was so fragile.

26:07.306 --> 26:11.007
And I fear that it will not survive the winter.

26:12.520 --> 26:13.979
Maximus...

26:14.897 --> 26:17.815
let us whisper now...

26:18.067 --> 26:19.811
together, you and I.

26:20.528 --> 26:22.022
You have a son.

26:23.573 --> 26:25.400
Tell me about your home.

26:31.622 --> 26:34.493
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

26:35.918 --> 26:37.662
A very simple place.

26:38.087 --> 26:41.041
<i>Pink stones that warm in the sun.</i>

26:41.132 --> 26:44.583
A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day...

26:45.344 --> 26:47.254
jasmine in the evening.

26:48.931 --> 26:51.505
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

26:51.809 --> 26:54.644
Figs, apples, pears.

26:54.729 --> 26:58.596
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

26:59.609 --> 27:01.767
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

27:01.861 --> 27:04.103
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

27:04.197 --> 27:05.821
He wants to be one of them.

27:05.907 --> 27:07.734
When was the last time you were home?

27:07.825 --> 27:10.910
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

27:12.538 --> 27:15.824
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

27:17.543 --> 27:19.251
Worth fighting for.

27:22.090 --> 27:24.213
There is one more duty...

27:24.759 --> 27:27.511
that I ask of you before you go home.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.553
What would you have me do, Caesar?

27:31.641 --> 27:35.259
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

27:36.437 --> 27:39.438
I will empower you to one end alone...

27:39.982 --> 27:43.482
to give power back to the people of Rome...

27:43.778 --> 27:46.862
and end the corruption that has crippled it.

27:53.121 --> 27:56.786
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

27:58.251 --> 28:00.160
With all my heart, no.

28:02.630 --> 28:04.374
Maximus...

28:04.966 --> 28:07.883
that is why it must be you.

28:07.969 --> 28:10.045
But surely a prefect, a senator...

28:10.138 --> 28:12.711
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

28:12.807 --> 28:16.010
But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.

28:20.940 --> 28:24.558
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

28:25.445 --> 28:27.983
You have known that since you were young.

28:28.197 --> 28:30.154
Commodus cannot rule.

28:30.241 --> 28:32.613
He must not rule.

28:34.162 --> 28:36.949
You are the son that I should have had.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.501
Commodus will accept my decision.

28:44.672 --> 28:49.464
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

28:54.432 --> 28:56.010
I need some time, sire.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.559
Yes.

28:57.643 --> 29:01.226
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

29:02.273 --> 29:04.431
Now embrace me as my son.

29:07.862 --> 29:10.567
And bring an old man another blanket.

29:26.839 --> 29:29.793
My father favors you now.
My lady.

29:29.884 --> 29:32.920
- It was not always so.
- Many things change.

29:33.179 --> 29:36.346
Many things. Not everything.

29:39.268 --> 29:40.928
Maximus, stop.

29:44.482 --> 29:46.391
Let me see your face.

29:48.986 --> 29:51.904
You seem upset.
I lost many men.

29:52.573 --> 29:54.899
What did my father want with you?

29:55.993 --> 29:58.947
To wish me well before I leave for home.

29:59.622 --> 30:01.116
You're lying.

30:01.207 --> 30:04.790
<i>I could always tell when you were lying
because you were never any good at it.</i>

30:04.877 --> 30:07.415
- I never acquired your comfort with it.
- True.

30:07.505 --> 30:09.628
But then you never had to.

30:10.133 --> 30:12.837
Life is more simple for a soldier.

30:14.637 --> 30:16.843
Or do you think me heartless?

30:17.849 --> 30:20.600
I think you have a talent for survival.

30:26.607 --> 30:28.150
Maximus, stop.

30:30.486 --> 30:32.977
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

30:33.322 --> 30:35.813
No. I'm tired from battle.

30:36.451 --> 30:39.368
It hurts you to see
my father so fragile.

30:42.373 --> 30:46.453
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

30:47.962 --> 30:51.378
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

30:53.509 --> 30:55.668
I will always serve Rome.

30:57.597 --> 30:59.424
Do you know...

30:59.515 --> 31:02.006
I still remember you in my prayers.

31:03.061 --> 31:05.931
Oh, yes. I pray.

31:10.526 --> 31:13.812
I was sad to hear of your husband's death.
I mourned him.

31:15.698 --> 31:18.533
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

31:20.203 --> 31:22.610
Yes. Lucius.

31:24.290 --> 31:26.199
He'll be nearly eight years old.

31:26.292 --> 31:28.534
My son is also nearly eight.

31:31.339 --> 31:33.711
I thank you for your prayers.

31:41.265 --> 31:43.887
Ancestors,
I ask for your guidance.

31:45.186 --> 31:48.721
<i>Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.</i>

31:50.316 --> 31:54.100
Blessed Father, watch over my wife and son
with a ready sword.

31:55.321 --> 31:58.607
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

31:59.325 --> 32:01.484
<i>Ancestors, I honor you...</i>

32:02.704 --> 32:05.989
and will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

32:28.896 --> 32:30.272
Cicero.

32:34.694 --> 32:35.808
Sir.

32:40.283 --> 32:42.821
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

32:45.580 --> 32:48.153
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

32:48.875 --> 32:51.662
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

32:54.422 --> 32:57.339
We may not be able to go home, after all.

33:48.434 --> 33:51.221
Are you ready to do your duty
for Rome?

33:54.399 --> 33:55.774
Yes, Father.

33:56.901 --> 33:58.977
You will not be emperor.

34:02.198 --> 34:04.654
Which wiser, older man is to take my place?

34:04.742 --> 34:07.280
My powers will pass to Maximus...

34:08.496 --> 34:10.239
to hold in trust...

34:10.331 --> 34:14.080
until the Senate is ready to rule once more.

34:15.628 --> 34:19.079
Rome is to be a republic again.

34:21.007 --> 34:23.581
Maximus.
Yes.

34:29.726 --> 34:31.931
My decision disappoints you?

34:35.481 --> 34:37.521
You wrote to me once...

34:39.402 --> 34:41.809
listing the four chief virtues:

34:43.572 --> 34:44.853
Wisdom...

34:45.033 --> 34:46.408
justice...

34:46.617 --> 34:48.076
fortitude...

34:48.453 --> 34:50.244
and temperance.

34:52.415 --> 34:55.534
As I read the list, I knew I had none of them.

34:56.502 --> 34:58.958
But I have other virtues, Father.

35:00.173 --> 35:01.501
Ambition.

35:02.717 --> 35:05.718
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

35:07.055 --> 35:10.139
Resourcefulness, courage.

35:11.225 --> 35:15.519
Perhaps not on the battlefield,
but there are many forms of courage.

35:17.148 --> 35:20.398
Devotion to my family...

35:21.527 --> 35:22.903
to you.

35:24.405 --> 35:27.192
But none of my virtues were on your list.

35:29.452 --> 35:32.619
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

35:32.872 --> 35:34.200
Commodus...

35:35.124 --> 35:36.784
you go too far.

35:37.585 --> 35:40.586
I searched the faces of the gods...

35:41.339 --> 35:45.716
for ways to please you, to make you proud.

35:46.594 --> 35:48.587
<i>One kind word...</i>

35:49.013 --> 35:50.887
one full hug...

35:51.099 --> 35:54.764
where you pressed me to your chest
and held me tight...

35:55.895 --> 35:59.430
would have been like the sun on my heart
for 1,000 years.

36:02.110 --> 36:04.731
What is it in me you hate
so much?

36:04.821 --> 36:05.983
Commodus.

36:07.073 --> 36:09.196
All I've ever wanted...

36:09.450 --> 36:13.697
was to live up to you, Caesar.

36:14.997 --> 36:17.571
Father.
Commodus...

36:22.046 --> 36:24.169
your faults as a son...

36:25.133 --> 36:28.418
is my failure as a father.

36:39.188 --> 36:40.647
Come.

36:44.235 --> 36:45.694
Father.

37:00.585 --> 37:03.290
I would butcher the whole world...

37:04.213 --> 37:06.669
if you would only have loved me!

37:44.170 --> 37:47.254
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

37:52.887 --> 37:54.714
Lament with me, brother.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.764
Our great father is dead.

38:24.502 --> 38:26.210
How did he die?

38:27.380 --> 38:30.049
The surgeons say
there was no pain.

38:30.174 --> 38:32.250
<i>His breath gave out as he slept.</i>

38:42.019 --> 38:43.395
Father.

38:45.940 --> 38:48.561
Your emperor asks for your loyalty,
Maximus.

38:49.944 --> 38:51.569
Take my hand.

38:54.282 --> 38:56.109
<i>I only offer it once.</i>

39:10.298 --> 39:11.709
Quintus.

40:01.849 --> 40:03.391
Hail, Caesar.

40:04.310 --> 40:06.931
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

40:07.021 --> 40:09.595
- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.

40:09.690 --> 40:11.932
Sword.

40:14.445 --> 40:17.316
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

40:17.407 --> 40:20.443
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

40:20.660 --> 40:23.281
The Emperor died
of natural causes.

40:24.914 --> 40:27.156
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

40:30.336 --> 40:32.578
Please don't fight, Maximus.

40:34.298 --> 40:36.587
<i>I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.</i>

40:37.051 --> 40:38.878
Ride until dawn...

40:40.096 --> 40:41.638
and then execute him.

40:41.723 --> 40:44.130
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

40:44.434 --> 40:47.304
Promise me
that you will look after my family.

40:48.438 --> 40:51.107
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

41:15.965 --> 41:17.163
Kneel.

41:20.762 --> 41:23.087
<i>Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.</i>

41:23.181 --> 41:26.265
<i>Whisper to them
that I live only to hold them again.</i>

41:28.936 --> 41:31.262
At least give me a clean death.

41:32.982 --> 41:34.773
A soldier's death.

41:56.130 --> 41:59.297
The frost,
sometimes it makes the blade stick.

42:19.904 --> 42:21.315
Praetorian!

43:40.985 --> 43:42.978
<i>When was the last time
you were home?</i>

43:43.071 --> 43:46.107
<i>Two years,
264 days and this morning.</i>

43:47.617 --> 43:49.574
<i>Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son...</i>

43:49.660 --> 43:51.986
<i>I will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.</i>

43:52.080 --> 43:54.487
<i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i>

43:54.582 --> 43:57.155
<i>... with a ready sword,
for all else is dust and air.</i>

43:57.251 --> 44:00.252
<i>Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.</i>

44:00.338 --> 44:02.627
<i>For all else is dust and air.</i>

45:02.900 --> 45:04.893
Papa!

47:48.983 --> 47:50.477
Don't die.

47:56.824 --> 47:58.900
<i>You'll meet them again.</i>

48:00.536 --> 48:01.817
<i>Not yet.</i>

48:10.421 --> 48:14.170
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

48:48.543 --> 48:49.918
Don't die.

48:50.712 --> 48:53.084
They'll feed you to the lions.

48:53.214 --> 48:55.456
They are worth more than we are.

49:05.476 --> 49:06.935
Better now?

49:08.062 --> 49:09.971
Clean. You see?

49:40.678 --> 49:43.513
Proximo! My old friend.

49:44.932 --> 49:47.969
<i>Every day is a great day when you are here...</i>

49:48.436 --> 49:52.599
but today is your most fortunate day.

49:55.276 --> 49:58.977
Those giraffes you sold me,
they won't mate.

49:59.614 --> 50:03.481
They just walk around eating
and not mating.

50:04.786 --> 50:07.703
You sold me queer giraffes.

50:08.623 --> 50:11.292
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

50:14.879 --> 50:18.248
I do special price for you.
On what?

50:19.801 --> 50:22.718
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

50:36.651 --> 50:39.486
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

50:39.570 --> 50:42.192
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

50:42.407 --> 50:44.732
You need both, I think.

50:44.826 --> 50:46.024
Get up.

50:54.043 --> 50:55.870
What's your trade?

50:56.337 --> 50:57.666
I was a hunter.

50:57.755 --> 51:01.420
No, I bought him from a salt mine
in Carthage.

51:02.218 --> 51:03.593
Sit down.

51:07.473 --> 51:08.718
Mark of the legion.

51:10.017 --> 51:13.137
Deserter.
Maybe so, but who cares?

51:13.229 --> 51:14.344
He's a Spaniard.

51:14.439 --> 51:16.348
I'll take six. For 1,000.

51:16.441 --> 51:20.023
One thousand?
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

51:20.111 --> 51:22.104
These slaves are rotten.

51:22.196 --> 51:25.363
It all adds to the flavor. No, wait!

51:25.908 --> 51:27.616
I can negotiate.

51:28.703 --> 51:32.783
I'll give you 2,000, and 4,000 for the beasts.

51:32.957 --> 51:35.116
<i>That's 5,000 for an old friend.</i>

51:52.727 --> 51:55.930
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

51:56.230 --> 51:58.140
I am Proximo.

51:58.733 --> 52:01.402
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days...

52:01.486 --> 52:03.727
which will be the last
of your miserable lives...

52:03.821 --> 52:07.819
than that bitch of a mother
that brought you screaming into this world.

52:08.451 --> 52:11.784
<i>I did not pay good money for you
for your company.</i>

52:12.955 --> 52:16.159
I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.

52:16.918 --> 52:20.666
<i>And as your mother was there
at your beginning...</i>

52:21.672 --> 52:24.294
so I shall be there at your end.

52:25.843 --> 52:28.797
And when you die, and die you shall...

52:29.764 --> 52:32.681
your transition shall be to the sound of...

52:37.355 --> 52:38.814
Gladiators...

52:39.982 --> 52:41.477
I salute you.

52:46.280 --> 52:47.525
Red.

52:50.952 --> 52:52.280
Yellow.

52:53.454 --> 52:54.699
Yellow.

53:05.466 --> 53:06.664
Good.

53:07.343 --> 53:08.506
Red.

53:13.641 --> 53:14.970
Spaniard.

53:48.342 --> 53:50.668
That's enough for the moment!

53:51.012 --> 53:52.589
His time will come.

53:55.600 --> 53:56.679
Next.

54:10.073 --> 54:11.353
Spaniard...

54:12.867 --> 54:14.694
why don't you fight?

54:15.036 --> 54:16.530
We all have to fight.

54:16.621 --> 54:18.530
Well, I don't fight.

54:18.956 --> 54:22.207
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe,
I write down words...

54:22.293 --> 54:24.202
and speak seven languages.

54:24.295 --> 54:25.493
Good.

54:26.214 --> 54:29.250
Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

54:37.558 --> 54:41.141
Perhaps the scribe will be the one
who wins his freedom.

54:41.896 --> 54:43.141
Freedom?

54:44.273 --> 54:46.065
What do I have to do?

54:46.484 --> 54:48.773
You go in the arena and you kill me.

54:48.903 --> 54:50.278
And him...

54:51.239 --> 54:52.781
and the Numidian...

54:53.074 --> 54:54.616
and the deserter.

54:56.244 --> 54:57.738
And 100 more.

54:57.829 --> 55:00.580
And when there's no more to fight,
you're free.

55:01.249 --> 55:02.992
I can't do that.

55:04.085 --> 55:05.248
No?

55:11.509 --> 55:12.920
But I can.

55:28.443 --> 55:30.649
Is that the sign of your gods?

55:35.867 --> 55:37.943
Will that not anger them?

55:59.307 --> 56:00.967
The gods favor you.

56:01.309 --> 56:03.467
Red is the gods' color.

56:04.854 --> 56:07.060
You will need their help today.

56:46.396 --> 56:48.020
Proximo!

56:53.361 --> 56:55.519
Still leading with the German?

56:55.613 --> 56:57.736
The crowd love a barbarian.

56:58.199 --> 57:00.108
Besides that, he's making me rich.

57:00.201 --> 57:02.774
Has that Numidian fought before?

57:03.621 --> 57:05.199
No, first time.

57:05.289 --> 57:08.243
And that one, laborer, soldier?

57:08.710 --> 57:13.039
He's a Spaniard. He might as well
be a eunuch, for what he brings to the ring.

57:14.048 --> 57:18.260
Five hundred sestertii, the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.

57:18.386 --> 57:22.051
<i>And 1,000,
that the Numidian makes it through alone.</i>

57:23.599 --> 57:26.719
Are you asking me
to bet against my own man?

57:28.563 --> 57:29.891
It's unethical.

57:30.106 --> 57:31.980
What if I make it 2,000?

57:46.330 --> 57:49.331
Some of you are thinking you won't fight...

57:50.626 --> 57:52.619
some that you can't fight.

57:53.421 --> 57:56.920
They all say that until they're out there.

57:59.594 --> 58:00.792
Listen.

58:01.596 --> 58:04.265
Kill!

58:10.855 --> 58:13.607
Thrust this into another man's flesh...

58:13.983 --> 58:16.652
and they will applaud and love you for that.

58:16.778 --> 58:18.153
And you...

58:20.156 --> 58:22.113
you may begin to love them...

58:22.950 --> 58:24.326
for that.

58:28.539 --> 58:32.039
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

58:34.504 --> 58:36.792
Sadly, we cannot choose how...

58:37.924 --> 58:40.675
but we can decide how we meet that end...

58:41.719 --> 58:44.210
in order that we are remembered...

58:46.182 --> 58:47.345
as men.

58:47.433 --> 58:48.512
Come on!

58:51.521 --> 58:53.893
On the left, draw your shields!

58:54.857 --> 58:57.229
<i>On the right, draw your swords!</i>

58:57.902 --> 58:59.978
Kill! Kill!

59:01.197 --> 59:03.569
<i>Pair them up: Red with yellow.</i>

59:08.663 --> 59:09.825
Next!

59:15.712 --> 59:16.910
Move!

01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:35.108
Usurper!

01:02:57.892 --> 01:03:01.012
Go away!
You'll never rule us, Commodus!

01:03:30.967 --> 01:03:35.676
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?

01:03:35.972 --> 01:03:38.261
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

01:03:38.474 --> 01:03:40.633
I think he could do very well.

01:03:41.144 --> 01:03:43.183
For Rome, or for you?

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.694
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

01:03:58.953 --> 01:04:00.946
Lucius!
Mother!

01:04:03.166 --> 01:04:04.660
Hail, Caesar.

01:04:04.876 --> 01:04:06.370
Senators.

01:04:10.048 --> 01:04:12.965
Rome greets her new emperor.

01:04:13.051 --> 01:04:16.550
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.

01:04:16.679 --> 01:04:18.506
Thank you, Falco.

01:04:18.639 --> 01:04:22.684
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they weren't too expensive.

01:04:22.769 --> 01:04:24.808
Caesar.
Gracchus.

01:04:24.896 --> 01:04:27.351
All Rome rejoices in your return, Caesar.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.643
There are many matters
that require your attention.

01:04:33.404 --> 01:04:36.239
To order, please. To order.

01:04:36.741 --> 01:04:41.367
For your guidance, Caesar, the Senate
has prepared a series of protocols...

01:04:41.496 --> 01:04:44.532
to begin addressing the many problems
in the city...

01:04:44.665 --> 01:04:48.710
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter...

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:52.539
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

01:04:52.924 --> 01:04:54.715
So, if Caesar...

01:04:56.886 --> 01:04:58.760
Don't you see, Gracchus?

01:05:00.181 --> 01:05:02.506
That's the very problem, isn't it?

01:05:02.892 --> 01:05:05.810
My father spent all his time
at study...

01:05:07.355 --> 01:05:10.724
at books of learning and philosophy.

01:05:11.734 --> 01:05:15.684
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

01:05:16.197 --> 01:05:19.364
And all the while, the people were forgotten.

01:05:20.034 --> 01:05:22.193
But the Senate is the people, sire...

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:25.786
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

01:05:26.416 --> 01:05:30.034
I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

01:05:30.878 --> 01:05:33.369
Or have such splendid mistresses, Gaius.

01:05:33.464 --> 01:05:35.587
I think I understand my own people.

01:05:35.675 --> 01:05:39.126
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us...

01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:42.092
out of his own extensive experience.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.602
I call it love.

01:05:48.104 --> 01:05:51.271
<i>I am their father.
The people are my children.</i>

01:05:51.566 --> 01:05:54.187
I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

01:05:54.277 --> 01:05:57.313
Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?

01:06:03.911 --> 01:06:06.485
No, but if you interrupt me again...

01:06:07.999 --> 01:06:09.374
I assure you that you shall.

01:06:09.459 --> 01:06:11.784
Senator, my brother is very tired.

01:06:12.795 --> 01:06:16.959
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

01:06:17.508 --> 01:06:22.466
My lady, as always,
your lightest touch commands obedience.

01:06:29.604 --> 01:06:31.929
Who are they to lecture me?

01:06:32.148 --> 01:06:34.639
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

01:06:34.776 --> 01:06:37.646
What uses? All they do is talk.

01:06:38.821 --> 01:06:43.448
It should be just you and me and Rome.

01:06:43.534 --> 01:06:46.820
Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.

01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:48.990
Rome has changed.

01:06:49.082 --> 01:06:52.118
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.334
Of course, but leave the people their...

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:55.962
Illusions?

01:06:57.548 --> 01:06:59.007
Traditions.

01:06:59.842 --> 01:07:02.677
My father's war against the barbarians...

01:07:03.221 --> 01:07:06.886
He said it himself: It achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

01:07:06.974 --> 01:07:08.884
The people always love victories.

01:07:08.976 --> 01:07:12.642
Why? They didn't see the battles.

01:07:13.981 --> 01:07:15.974
What do they care about Germania?

01:07:16.067 --> 01:07:18.356
They care about the greatness of Rome.

01:07:18.444 --> 01:07:20.353
"The greatness of Rome."

01:07:22.323 --> 01:07:24.067
Well, what is that?

01:07:26.828 --> 01:07:30.031
It's an idea. Greatness.

01:07:33.835 --> 01:07:37.286
Greatness is a vision.
Exactly. A vision.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.214
Do you not see, Lucilla?

01:07:42.593 --> 01:07:46.543
I will give the people a vision of Rome,
and they'll love me for it.

01:07:47.223 --> 01:07:51.600
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:06.364
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

01:08:57.585 --> 01:09:00.705
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

01:09:08.763 --> 01:09:09.926
Games.

01:09:12.265 --> 01:09:15.303
One hundred and fifty days of games.

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:17.430
He's cleverer than I thought.

01:09:17.522 --> 01:09:21.020
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him...

01:09:21.776 --> 01:09:24.018
if they weren't so afraid of his Praetorians.

01:09:24.112 --> 01:09:26.947
Fear and wonder. A powerful combination.

01:09:28.323 --> 01:09:31.444
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

01:09:31.536 --> 01:09:34.620
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

01:09:35.331 --> 01:09:38.451
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:42.292
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:47.292
The beating heart of Rome
is not the marble of the Senate.

01:09:47.385 --> 01:09:49.377
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

01:09:51.305 --> 01:09:53.345
He'll bring them death...

01:09:55.143 --> 01:09:57.468
and they will love him for it.

01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:22.249
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

01:10:22.336 --> 01:10:24.744
The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.

01:10:24.839 --> 01:10:26.915
We want them to keep coming back.

01:10:27.008 --> 01:10:31.171
So don't just hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.

01:10:33.765 --> 01:10:35.093
Spaniard.

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.435
So entertain!

01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:53.671
Are you not entertained?

01:11:56.013 --> 01:11:58.255
Is this not why you're here?

01:12:02.854 --> 01:12:05.261
Spaniard!

01:12:23.124 --> 01:12:24.867
What do you want?

01:12:27.462 --> 01:12:28.624
<i>Girl?</i>

01:12:29.672 --> 01:12:30.787
<i>Boy?</i>

01:12:31.716 --> 01:12:33.958
- You sent for me.
- Yes, I did.

01:12:35.053 --> 01:12:38.137
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

01:12:38.222 --> 01:12:39.633
You could be magnificent.

01:12:39.724 --> 01:12:42.974
I'm required to kill, so I kill. That is enough.

01:12:43.811 --> 01:12:46.896
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

01:12:50.318 --> 01:12:54.185
The young emperor
has arranged a series of spectacles...

01:12:54.322 --> 01:12:58.485
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

01:12:58.993 --> 01:13:00.986
<i>I find that amusing...</i>

01:13:01.329 --> 01:13:04.365
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise...

01:13:04.499 --> 01:13:07.915
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius,
that closed us down.

01:13:10.922 --> 01:13:15.050
So finally,
after five years of scratching a living...

01:13:15.176 --> 01:13:17.334
in flea-infested villages...

01:13:17.428 --> 01:13:20.513
we're finally going back to where we belong:

01:13:21.224 --> 01:13:22.766
The Colosseum.

01:13:25.019 --> 01:13:27.806
You should see the Colosseum, Spaniard.

01:13:29.148 --> 01:13:31.224
Fifty-thousand Romans...

01:13:32.151 --> 01:13:35.983
watching every movement of your sword...

01:13:37.407 --> 01:13:39.862
willing you to make that killer blow.

01:13:41.077 --> 01:13:44.742
The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.

01:13:45.707 --> 01:13:49.325
It rises. It rises up...

01:13:50.878 --> 01:13:52.503
like a storm.

01:13:52.964 --> 01:13:55.371
As if you were the thunder god himself.

01:13:55.675 --> 01:13:58.676
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

01:14:05.101 --> 01:14:07.177
You won your freedom?

01:14:07.353 --> 01:14:09.761
A long time ago, the Emperor...

01:14:11.399 --> 01:14:13.557
presented me with a rudius.

01:14:15.319 --> 01:14:17.146
It's just a wooden sword.

01:14:17.989 --> 01:14:20.231
<i>The symbol of your freedom.</i>

01:14:22.410 --> 01:14:25.446
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

01:14:26.789 --> 01:14:29.197
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:33.124
I did not say I knew him.
I said he touched me on the shoulder once.

01:14:34.172 --> 01:14:36.330
You asked me what I want.

01:14:37.592 --> 01:14:40.546
I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor...

01:14:41.804 --> 01:14:43.215
as you did.

01:14:43.306 --> 01:14:46.722
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

01:14:47.602 --> 01:14:50.686
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.

01:14:51.856 --> 01:14:54.525
I was the best because the crowd loved me.

01:14:55.651 --> 01:14:58.937
Win the crowd, and you'll win your freedom.

01:15:03.409 --> 01:15:05.283
I will win the crowd.

01:15:07.538 --> 01:15:10.575
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

01:15:12.001 --> 01:15:15.121
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together...

01:15:15.671 --> 01:15:17.463
and have bloody adventures.

01:15:17.548 --> 01:15:19.541
And the great whore
will suckle us...

01:15:19.634 --> 01:15:22.041
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

01:15:22.136 --> 01:15:23.547
And then...

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:26.803
when enough men have died...

01:15:28.976 --> 01:15:31.432
perhaps you will have your freedom.

01:15:35.858 --> 01:15:38.230
Here. Use this.

01:16:01.926 --> 01:16:05.093
It's somewhere out there, my country.

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:07.461
<i>My home.</i>

01:16:08.683 --> 01:16:10.806
My wife is preparing food.

01:16:11.811 --> 01:16:14.516
My daughters carry water from the river.

01:16:15.857 --> 01:16:17.896
Will I ever see them again?

01:16:19.152 --> 01:16:20.694
I think, no.

01:16:20.987 --> 01:16:23.442
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:24.942
I think so.

01:16:25.533 --> 01:16:28.617
But then, I will die soon.

01:16:30.246 --> 01:16:32.702
They will not die for many years.

01:16:33.499 --> 01:16:35.159
I'll have to wait.

01:16:35.251 --> 01:16:37.457
But you would? Wait?

01:16:38.087 --> 01:16:39.416
Of course.

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.716
You see...

01:16:43.885 --> 01:16:45.260
my wife...

01:16:46.763 --> 01:16:50.677
and my son are already waiting for me.

01:16:51.434 --> 01:16:55.052
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

01:16:59.150 --> 01:17:00.478
Not yet.

01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:03.528
- Unless...
- Not yet.

01:17:07.742 --> 01:17:08.821
Not yet.

01:17:22.215 --> 01:17:23.495
There he is.

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:13.755
Out.

01:18:14.976 --> 01:18:16.885
<i>Move, go, out!</i>

01:18:29.615 --> 01:18:32.189
Good to see you again,
old friend.

01:18:37.457 --> 01:18:39.165
Bring me fortune.

01:18:43.755 --> 01:18:46.625
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

01:18:47.717 --> 01:18:50.290
<i>I didn't know men could build such things.</i>

01:19:00.271 --> 01:19:01.813
Win the crowd.

01:19:02.065 --> 01:19:04.306
Get inside. Move.

01:19:04.484 --> 01:19:05.764
<i>Inside.</i>

01:19:54.992 --> 01:19:57.697
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

01:20:00.665 --> 01:20:02.741
Come, brother. It's late.

01:20:06.337 --> 01:20:09.255
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

01:20:11.968 --> 01:20:15.301
That is what Gracchus and his friends
don't understand.

01:20:15.722 --> 01:20:19.007
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

01:20:26.023 --> 01:20:28.728
Commodus, drink this tonic.

01:20:38.327 --> 01:20:40.949
I think the time is almost right.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.951
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate...

01:20:44.125 --> 01:20:46.201
at the celebration to honor our father.

01:20:46.294 --> 01:20:48.370
Do you think I should?

01:20:49.005 --> 01:20:51.044
Are the people ready?

01:20:53.051 --> 01:20:55.423
I think you need your rest now.

01:21:01.392 --> 01:21:03.184
Will you stay with me?

01:21:03.269 --> 01:21:05.677
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

01:21:12.445 --> 01:21:13.643
Still.

01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:16.770
Always.

01:21:18.493 --> 01:21:21.363
- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won't.

01:21:25.875 --> 01:21:27.369
Then kiss me.

01:21:36.177 --> 01:21:37.755
Sleep, brother.

01:22:30.523 --> 01:22:32.646
Having servants who are deaf and mute...

01:22:32.734 --> 01:22:35.485
at least ensures I live a little longer.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.605
They're arresting scholars now.

01:22:39.699 --> 01:22:43.531
Anyone who dare speak out.
Even satirists and chroniclers.

01:22:44.162 --> 01:22:46.071
And mathematicians.

01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:49.448
And all to feed the arena.

01:22:51.085 --> 01:22:53.623
The Senate did not approve martial law.

01:22:53.713 --> 01:22:56.916
This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians.

01:22:57.592 --> 01:22:59.715
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

01:22:59.802 --> 01:23:03.254
You should be more afraid
of your activities during the day.

01:23:03.473 --> 01:23:08.135
The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:13.898
But what is in his mind?
That's what I trouble myself with.

01:23:14.692 --> 01:23:17.610
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed...

01:23:17.695 --> 01:23:20.530
planning the festival to honor your father.

01:23:20.615 --> 01:23:24.197
He neglects even the most fundamental task
of government.

01:23:24.952 --> 01:23:27.159
So just what is he planning?

01:23:27.538 --> 01:23:29.163
And what pays for it?

01:23:29.248 --> 01:23:33.460
These daily games are costing a fortune,
yet we have no new taxes.

01:23:34.212 --> 01:23:35.622
The future.

01:23:37.048 --> 01:23:39.040
The future pays for it.

01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:43.048
He's started selling the grain reserves.

01:23:43.513 --> 01:23:45.339
This can't be true.

01:23:45.932 --> 01:23:48.683
He's selling
Rome's reserves of grain.

01:23:49.018 --> 01:23:51.936
The people will be starving in two years.

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:53.974
I hope they're enjoying the games...

01:23:54.065 --> 01:23:57.434
because soon enough
they'll be dead because of them.

01:23:57.777 --> 01:24:00.102
- Rome must know this.
- And how?

01:24:00.613 --> 01:24:02.985
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

01:24:03.574 --> 01:24:07.109
And who will tell them before it's too late?
You, Gracchus?

01:24:08.496 --> 01:24:09.990
You, Gaius.

01:24:10.081 --> 01:24:14.079
Will you make a speech on the floor
of the Senate, denouncing my brother?

01:24:14.168 --> 01:24:16.706
And then see your family in the Colosseum?

01:24:17.714 --> 01:24:19.042
Who'd dare?

01:24:28.224 --> 01:24:31.225
I have been living
in a prison of fear every day...

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:33.932
because my son is heir to the throne.

01:24:39.569 --> 01:24:41.027
He must die.

01:24:45.408 --> 01:24:49.156
Quintus and the Praetorians
would simply seize control for themselves.

01:24:49.245 --> 01:24:53.077
No. Cut off the head
and the snake cannot strike.

01:24:53.166 --> 01:24:55.242
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

01:24:55.334 --> 01:24:59.463
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians,
we can achieve nothing.

01:25:01.007 --> 01:25:02.501
So we do nothing?

01:25:02.592 --> 01:25:05.379
No, child. We keep our counsel.

01:25:06.345 --> 01:25:07.756
We prepare.

01:25:08.598 --> 01:25:13.343
As long as the people support him,
we are voices without steel.

01:25:14.145 --> 01:25:15.556
We are air.

01:25:18.608 --> 01:25:21.359
But with every day that passes,
he makes enemies.

01:25:21.444 --> 01:25:24.314
One day,
he'll have more enemies than friends.

01:25:24.739 --> 01:25:27.693
And on that day, we will act.

01:25:28.284 --> 01:25:30.158
<i>Then we will strike.</i>

01:25:31.079 --> 01:25:32.822
But until then...

01:25:33.998 --> 01:25:35.540
we are docile.

01:25:36.042 --> 01:25:38.200
We are obedient.

01:25:39.796 --> 01:25:41.788
And we are treacherous.

01:25:50.431 --> 01:25:51.676
Come on!

01:26:00.441 --> 01:26:02.481
All right, that's enough.

01:26:25.049 --> 01:26:28.798
The Emperor wants battles, and I don't want
to sacrifice my best fighters.

01:26:28.886 --> 01:26:32.053
The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.

01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:35.722
- You get the battle of Carthage.
- Massacre of Carthage.

01:26:37.311 --> 01:26:41.179
Well, why don't you go down to the prison,
round up all the beggars and thieves?

01:26:41.274 --> 01:26:42.436
We've done that.

01:26:42.525 --> 01:26:46.143
If you want to give away the best gladiators
in the whole of the empire...

01:26:46.237 --> 01:26:48.360
then I want double the rates.

01:26:48.448 --> 01:26:52.196
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract cancelled.

01:26:52.285 --> 01:26:53.744
You don't like it?

01:26:53.828 --> 01:26:57.778
Then you can crawl back
down that shit hole that you came from.

01:27:00.877 --> 01:27:03.249
Cassius, please. You can free us.

01:27:32.909 --> 01:27:35.910
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

01:27:36.079 --> 01:27:37.193
Yes.

01:27:37.997 --> 01:27:40.156
They said you were a giant.

01:27:40.291 --> 01:27:43.411
They said you could crush a man's skull
with one hand.

01:27:43.544 --> 01:27:45.288
A man's? No.

01:27:46.631 --> 01:27:47.911
A boy's.

01:27:49.967 --> 01:27:53.502
- Do they have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.

01:27:54.555 --> 01:27:57.640
This is Argento and this is Scarto.

01:27:59.018 --> 01:28:00.845
They were my horses.

01:28:01.771 --> 01:28:03.847
They were taken from me.

01:28:04.148 --> 01:28:07.434
I like you, Spaniard. I shall cheer for you.

01:28:07.985 --> 01:28:11.319
- They let you watch the games?
- My uncle says it makes me strong.

01:28:11.406 --> 01:28:14.691
- And what does your father say?
- My father is dead.

01:28:16.494 --> 01:28:18.534
Master Lucius, it is time.

01:28:19.831 --> 01:28:21.159
I have to go.

01:28:21.249 --> 01:28:22.826
Your name is Lucius?

01:28:24.961 --> 01:28:27.630
Lucius Verus, after my father.

01:28:58.244 --> 01:28:59.987
Lower!

01:29:05.126 --> 01:29:06.585
Claudius!

01:29:06.836 --> 01:29:09.244
Yes?
More shields!

01:29:09.338 --> 01:29:10.881
All right.

01:29:29.650 --> 01:29:34.396
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him...

01:29:34.489 --> 01:29:36.565
and then speak together.

01:29:37.325 --> 01:29:40.824
<i>Face the Emperor
and don't turn your back on him.</i>

01:29:41.913 --> 01:29:44.783
<i>Go, and die with honor.</i>

01:30:39.846 --> 01:30:41.922
Hail, mighty Caesar!

01:30:45.143 --> 01:30:49.390
Caesar!

01:30:52.442 --> 01:30:55.396
We who are about to die
salute you!

01:30:57.113 --> 01:30:58.821
On this day...

01:30:59.407 --> 01:31:02.443
we reach back to hallowed antiquity...

01:31:03.327 --> 01:31:06.946
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall...

01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:09.116
of mighty Carthage!

01:31:12.795 --> 01:31:17.173
On the barren plain of Zama...

01:31:17.842 --> 01:31:20.843
there stood the invincible armies...

01:31:21.304 --> 01:31:23.925
of the barbarian Hannibal.

01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:27.807
Ferocious mercenaries
and warriors...

01:31:27.894 --> 01:31:30.266
from all brute nations...

01:31:30.354 --> 01:31:34.648
bent on merciless destruction...

01:31:35.526 --> 01:31:36.855
conquest.

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:41.865
<i>Your emperor is pleased to give you...</i>

01:31:41.949 --> 01:31:45.034
the barbarian horde!

01:31:53.378 --> 01:31:55.335
Anyone here been in the army?

01:31:55.421 --> 01:31:58.375
Yes. I served with you
at Vindobona.

01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:00.842
You can help me.

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:04.508
Whatever comes out of these gates...

01:32:05.556 --> 01:32:08.890
we've got a better chance of survival
if we work together.

01:32:09.394 --> 01:32:11.137
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:32:13.231 --> 01:32:15.307
If we stay together, we survive.

01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:18.519
The Emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires...

01:32:18.611 --> 01:32:22.194
of Scipio Africanus!

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.708
To the death!

01:32:38.506 --> 01:32:41.079
Kill!

01:32:44.929 --> 01:32:46.554
Stay close.

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:54.394
Come together!

01:32:55.732 --> 01:32:59.776
Stay close. Staggered columns!

01:33:12.623 --> 01:33:14.533
You don't have a chance.

01:33:26.387 --> 01:33:28.925
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

01:33:30.433 --> 01:33:31.975
Hold!

01:33:34.145 --> 01:33:37.062
Hold! As one!

01:33:39.984 --> 01:33:41.313
Well done.

01:33:53.164 --> 01:33:56.996
Hold. Down low!

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.003
Yes!

01:34:16.145 --> 01:34:17.343
Hagen!

01:34:41.504 --> 01:34:45.039
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

01:34:48.678 --> 01:34:50.053
Quickly!

01:34:50.722 --> 01:34:53.473
- Get out there.
- Hurry!

01:35:34.682 --> 01:35:35.880
Maximus!

01:35:48.071 --> 01:35:50.443
Single column!

01:36:35.785 --> 01:36:37.160
We win!

01:36:42.583 --> 01:36:45.121
My history's a little hazy, Cassius...

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:48.838
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

01:36:48.923 --> 01:36:50.666
Yes, sire.

01:36:52.635 --> 01:36:53.964
Forgive me, sire.

01:36:54.053 --> 01:36:56.758
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

01:36:57.515 --> 01:36:58.678
Who is he?

01:36:58.766 --> 01:37:01.767
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

01:37:04.272 --> 01:37:06.099
I think I'll meet him.

01:37:06.274 --> 01:37:07.649
Yes, sire.

01:37:09.819 --> 01:37:11.693
Hail to the barbarians!

01:37:26.669 --> 01:37:30.038
Forward! Arms at ready!

01:37:43.644 --> 01:37:45.304
Drop your weapons.

01:37:49.317 --> 01:37:52.234
Gladiator, the Emperor has asked for you.

01:37:52.904 --> 01:37:55.027
I am at the Emperor's service.

01:38:21.766 --> 01:38:23.924
Rise.

01:38:33.444 --> 01:38:35.520
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

01:38:35.613 --> 01:38:38.282
I don't think there's ever been a gladiator
to match you.

01:38:38.366 --> 01:38:41.153
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

01:38:41.244 --> 01:38:42.786
Or was it Hercules?

01:38:44.205 --> 01:38:47.954
<i>Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?</i>

01:38:50.086 --> 01:38:51.710
You do have a name.

01:38:52.463 --> 01:38:54.372
My name is Gladiator.

01:38:57.635 --> 01:39:00.802
How dare you show your back to me? Slave!

01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:05.473
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

01:39:17.321 --> 01:39:19.812
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius...

01:39:20.158 --> 01:39:22.115
commander of the armies of the north...

01:39:22.201 --> 01:39:24.657
general of the Felix Legions...

01:39:24.746 --> 01:39:27.996
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius...

01:39:29.333 --> 01:39:31.492
father to a murdered son...

01:39:32.003 --> 01:39:34.292
husband to a murdered wife...

01:39:34.672 --> 01:39:38.337
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

01:39:45.349 --> 01:39:46.760
Arms!

01:39:59.864 --> 01:40:03.198
Live!

01:40:50.498 --> 01:40:53.203
Arms, at rest!

01:41:45.636 --> 01:41:50.133
Maximus!

01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:39.434
Father.

01:43:53.765 --> 01:43:55.722
Why is he still alive?

01:43:56.934 --> 01:43:58.429
I don't know.

01:43:58.936 --> 01:44:00.561
He shouldn't be alive.

01:44:01.355 --> 01:44:02.766
It vexes me.

01:44:04.525 --> 01:44:06.269
I'm terribly vexed.

01:44:17.455 --> 01:44:19.448
I did what I had to do.

01:44:20.208 --> 01:44:24.252
<i>If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.</i>

01:44:24.337 --> 01:44:25.961
<i>You do see that.</i>

01:44:26.381 --> 01:44:27.543
Yes.

01:44:32.303 --> 01:44:35.589
What did you feel when you saw him?

01:44:37.642 --> 01:44:39.302
I felt nothing.

01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:43.808
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

01:44:44.816 --> 01:44:47.057
No more than I wounded him.

01:44:51.614 --> 01:44:53.820
They lied to me in Germania.

01:44:55.493 --> 01:44:57.569
They told me he was dead.

01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:02.154
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

01:45:02.291 --> 01:45:05.577
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

01:45:06.921 --> 01:45:09.293
Then you must let the legions know...

01:45:09.382 --> 01:45:12.502
their treachery will not go unpunished.

01:45:13.344 --> 01:45:14.969
Poor sister.

01:45:15.179 --> 01:45:17.635
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

01:45:18.850 --> 01:45:20.593
What will you do?

01:45:33.531 --> 01:45:34.859
This way.

01:46:10.318 --> 01:46:13.734
Rich matrons pay well
to be pleasured by the bravest champions.

01:46:13.821 --> 01:46:16.312
I knew your brother would send assassins.

01:46:16.824 --> 01:46:19.446
I didn't realize he would send his best.

01:46:21.079 --> 01:46:23.155
Maximus, he doesn't know.

01:46:24.123 --> 01:46:27.326
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

01:46:27.418 --> 01:46:29.956
- I knew nothing...
- Don't lie to me!

01:46:36.344 --> 01:46:38.004
I wept for them.

01:46:38.179 --> 01:46:42.011
As you wept for your father?

01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:45.682
I have been living in a prison of fear
since that day.

01:46:46.187 --> 01:46:50.019
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

01:46:50.942 --> 01:46:54.108
To live in terror
every moment of every day...

01:46:54.195 --> 01:46:56.982
because your son is heir to the throne.

01:46:58.866 --> 01:47:00.325
I have wept.

01:47:01.661 --> 01:47:04.496
My son was innocent.

01:47:05.331 --> 01:47:07.371
So is mine.

01:47:09.377 --> 01:47:12.461
Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?

01:47:13.923 --> 01:47:16.877
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:20.797
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

01:47:20.888 --> 01:47:24.340
Today I saw a slave become more powerful
than the emperor of Rome.

01:47:24.434 --> 01:47:26.225
The gods have spared me?

01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:29.762
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob.

01:47:29.856 --> 01:47:31.564
That is power.

01:47:31.858 --> 01:47:33.020
The mob is Rome.

01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:36.857
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

01:47:37.071 --> 01:47:38.613
Listen to me.

01:47:39.157 --> 01:47:42.074
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

01:47:42.368 --> 01:47:44.610
But while the people follow him...

01:47:44.704 --> 01:47:47.705
no one would dare stand up to him
until you.

01:47:48.708 --> 01:47:51.115
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:54.829
There are some politicians
who have dedicated their lives to Rome.

01:47:54.922 --> 01:47:56.666
One man above all.

01:47:57.759 --> 01:48:00.843
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

01:48:01.179 --> 01:48:03.088
Do you not understand?

01:48:03.347 --> 01:48:07.594
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

01:48:07.685 --> 01:48:10.307
What possible difference can I make?

01:48:10.605 --> 01:48:12.847
This man wants what you want.

01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:15.182
Then have him kill Commodus!

01:48:17.737 --> 01:48:19.564
I knew a man once...

01:48:20.490 --> 01:48:21.818
a noble man.

01:48:22.742 --> 01:48:25.659
A man of principle who loved my father...

01:48:26.662 --> 01:48:28.702
and my father loved him.

01:48:30.666 --> 01:48:32.825
This man served Rome well.

01:48:37.173 --> 01:48:38.881
That man is gone.

01:48:40.051 --> 01:48:42.174
Your brother did his work well.

01:48:42.261 --> 01:48:43.921
Let me help you.

01:48:49.852 --> 01:48:52.937
Yes, you can help me.

01:48:56.275 --> 01:48:59.976
Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.

01:49:03.658 --> 01:49:06.410
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

01:49:34.856 --> 01:49:36.516
What's your name?

01:49:39.527 --> 01:49:40.938
Julian Crassus.

01:49:46.617 --> 01:49:47.815
Name?

01:49:49.162 --> 01:49:50.656
Marcus, sire.

01:49:51.581 --> 01:49:53.408
My father's name.

01:50:00.798 --> 01:50:05.507
They must have known of Maximus' escape
when they found the bodies of the four men.

01:50:06.345 --> 01:50:08.919
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

01:50:09.974 --> 01:50:13.141
These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.

01:50:20.401 --> 01:50:22.441
Load your arrows!

01:50:29.369 --> 01:50:31.278
Prepare to fire!

01:50:52.266 --> 01:50:55.552
Then perhaps it was you
who knew...

01:50:56.396 --> 01:50:57.854
and never told me.

01:50:58.356 --> 01:51:00.598
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

01:51:02.110 --> 01:51:04.945
But a general
is always in control.

01:51:06.322 --> 01:51:09.987
Always in command, isn't he?

01:51:11.536 --> 01:51:12.994
Yes, Caesar.

01:51:26.926 --> 01:51:29.595
Then give the command. Say it.

01:51:46.529 --> 01:51:47.692
Fire.

01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:24.221
Maximus.

01:52:24.984 --> 01:52:28.104
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

01:52:28.988 --> 01:52:31.230
- Yes.
- In Germania?

01:52:33.117 --> 01:52:34.861
In many countries.

01:52:36.454 --> 01:52:37.782
General.

01:53:26.879 --> 01:53:28.753
You have a great name.

01:53:30.299 --> 01:53:33.300
He must kill your name before he kills you.

01:53:42.270 --> 01:53:43.598
Yes, at the far end.

01:53:43.688 --> 01:53:46.013
Senator Gaius.
Hello.

01:53:46.107 --> 01:53:48.064
Senator Gracchus.

01:53:49.694 --> 01:53:53.063
Don't often see you enjoying the pleasures
of the vulgar crowd.

01:53:53.156 --> 01:53:56.322
I don't pretend to be a man of the people,
Senator...

01:53:56.409 --> 01:53:58.947
but I do try to be a man for the people.

01:54:15.136 --> 01:54:19.632
Caesar!

01:54:24.896 --> 01:54:26.604
People of Rome!

01:54:28.858 --> 01:54:31.266
On the fourth day of Antioch...

01:54:31.903 --> 01:54:36.280
we can celebrate the 64th day of the games.

01:54:36.908 --> 01:54:41.155
<i>And in his majestic charity...</i>

01:54:41.913 --> 01:54:46.124
<i>the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome...</i>

01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:50.125
<i>with an historical final match.</i>

01:54:50.922 --> 01:54:55.500
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement...

01:54:56.928 --> 01:55:00.379
Caesar is pleased to bring you...

01:55:00.473 --> 01:55:04.257
the only undefeated champion...

01:55:04.352 --> 01:55:06.344
in Roman history:

01:55:06.437 --> 01:55:11.313
The legendary Tigris of Gaul!

01:55:32.964 --> 01:55:36.130
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

01:55:36.217 --> 01:55:38.886
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

01:55:38.970 --> 01:55:41.721
This is not it.

01:55:41.806 --> 01:55:44.641
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

01:55:45.476 --> 01:55:48.098
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

01:55:48.771 --> 01:55:50.847
<i>Shadows and dust, Maximus!</i>

01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:54.807
Representing the training lyceum
of Antonius Proximo...

01:55:54.902 --> 01:55:58.567
Caesar is proud to give you...

01:55:58.656 --> 01:56:02.488
Aelius Maximus!

01:56:15.298 --> 01:56:17.670
They embrace him
like he's one of their own.

01:56:17.759 --> 01:56:21.673
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

01:56:24.432 --> 01:56:27.267
No, much sooner than that.

01:56:29.187 --> 01:56:30.978
It's been arranged.

01:56:49.499 --> 01:56:52.453
We who are about to die salute you.

01:56:55.755 --> 01:56:57.712
We're with you, Maximus!

01:57:40.174 --> 01:57:41.716
Fight on, finish it!

01:58:10.204 --> 01:58:11.864
Pull, pull!

01:58:44.238 --> 01:58:45.816
Loose! Loose!

01:59:13.893 --> 01:59:15.969
Gut him!
Kill!

01:59:17.438 --> 01:59:21.021
Kill!

02:00:21.377 --> 02:00:23.584
Maximus the Merciful!

02:00:32.764 --> 02:00:37.556
Maximus!

02:00:44.859 --> 02:00:47.694
Forward, arms at ready!

02:01:18.351 --> 02:01:20.842
What am I going to do
with you?

02:01:21.854 --> 02:01:25.354
You simply won't die.

02:01:30.154 --> 02:01:32.480
Are we so different, you and I?

02:01:33.616 --> 02:01:36.534
You take life when you have to, as I do.

02:01:37.912 --> 02:01:41.957
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

02:01:42.125 --> 02:01:43.868
Then take it now.

02:01:56.889 --> 02:01:58.929
<i>They tell me your son...</i>

02:01:59.726 --> 02:02:03.640
<i>squealed like a girl
when they nailed him to the cross.</i>

02:02:05.815 --> 02:02:07.475
And your wife...

02:02:08.693 --> 02:02:10.602
moaned like a whore...

02:02:11.738 --> 02:02:16.281
when they ravaged her again and again...

02:02:17.660 --> 02:02:19.035
and again.

02:02:24.292 --> 02:02:28.040
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end...

02:02:32.675 --> 02:02:34.004
Highness.

02:02:51.319 --> 02:02:53.146
Maximus!

02:03:01.537 --> 02:03:02.913
General!

02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:11.496
General!
Cicero!

02:03:19.222 --> 02:03:21.510
- Where are you camped?
- Ostia.

02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:30.934
We love you, Maximus!
Praise the victor!

02:03:31.025 --> 02:03:33.563
Tell the men their general lives. Find me.

02:03:33.653 --> 02:03:35.978
Move along!
Find me!

02:04:01.347 --> 02:04:03.304
Can they hear you?

02:04:06.894 --> 02:04:10.394
- Who?
- Your family, in the afterlife.

02:04:12.859 --> 02:04:15.480
Yes.
What do you say to them?

02:04:19.115 --> 02:04:20.574
To my boy...

02:04:22.410 --> 02:04:24.948
I tell him I will see him again soon...

02:04:25.038 --> 02:04:28.656
and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

02:04:29.917 --> 02:04:31.412
To my wife...

02:04:33.921 --> 02:04:36.044
that is not your business.

02:04:43.806 --> 02:04:46.677
And now they love Maximus for his mercy.

02:04:48.102 --> 02:04:51.637
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.

02:04:52.982 --> 02:04:57.229
The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.

02:04:58.362 --> 02:05:00.106
He is defying you.

02:05:00.281 --> 02:05:03.697
His every victory is an act of defiance.

02:05:03.826 --> 02:05:07.444
The mob sees this, and so do the Senate.

02:05:08.164 --> 02:05:11.081
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

02:05:12.543 --> 02:05:14.335
- Kill him.
- No.

02:05:16.214 --> 02:05:18.621
I will not make a martyr of him.

02:05:25.765 --> 02:05:28.303
When I went to the Senate today...

02:05:28.393 --> 02:05:33.268
I purposefully told them about using
the grain reserves to pay for the games.

02:05:34.690 --> 02:05:36.849
And did you note what happened?

02:05:36.943 --> 02:05:40.146
- Nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.

02:05:41.155 --> 02:05:43.527
Not a single word of protest.

02:05:43.616 --> 02:05:47.199
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus
was silent as a mouse.

02:05:47.286 --> 02:05:48.449
Why?

02:05:50.206 --> 02:05:53.871
I have been told of a certain sea snake...

02:05:53.960 --> 02:05:58.289
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

02:05:58.464 --> 02:06:02.213
It will lie at the bottom of the ocean
as if wounded.

02:06:02.635 --> 02:06:05.470
Then its enemies will approach...

02:06:05.555 --> 02:06:08.639
and yet it will lie quite still.

02:06:08.975 --> 02:06:12.807
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it...

02:06:12.895 --> 02:06:16.145
and yet it remains still.

02:06:19.402 --> 02:06:20.564
So...

02:06:21.904 --> 02:06:23.648
we will lie still...

02:06:24.490 --> 02:06:27.824
and let our enemies come to us and nibble.

02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:31.111
<i>Have every senator followed.</i>

02:06:48.806 --> 02:06:52.590
Cicero, my old friend. I thought perhaps
I'd seen you for the last time.

02:06:52.685 --> 02:06:55.093
I thought you were dead.
Close.

02:06:55.188 --> 02:06:58.307
- How long have the men been in Ostia?
- All winter.

02:06:58.608 --> 02:07:01.858
- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.

02:07:02.570 --> 02:07:05.737
Who's in command?
Some fool from Rome.

02:07:07.033 --> 02:07:09.275
How soon do you think
they could be ready to fight?

02:07:09.369 --> 02:07:11.160
For you, tomorrow.

02:07:12.413 --> 02:07:14.904
I need you to do something for me.

02:07:19.545 --> 02:07:20.956
Come, see, witness.

02:07:21.047 --> 02:07:24.083
<i>If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.</i>

02:07:24.175 --> 02:07:27.793
Giant Maximus
is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

02:07:27.887 --> 02:07:30.460
What are we to do?
He's just defying everyone...

02:07:30.556 --> 02:07:32.596
by doing this to him, they do...

02:07:33.518 --> 02:07:34.846
My goodness!

02:07:36.646 --> 02:07:40.229
He got him, he's defeated.
Give way!

02:07:46.364 --> 02:07:49.033
My lady? I served your father at Vindobona.

02:07:49.117 --> 02:07:50.527
Back.
My lady.

02:07:50.618 --> 02:07:52.776
<i>I served your father at Vindobona.</i>

02:07:53.121 --> 02:07:54.200
Back!

02:07:54.288 --> 02:07:57.492
And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.

02:07:59.001 --> 02:08:00.164
Stop.

02:08:03.214 --> 02:08:04.625
<i>Stand back.</i>

02:08:05.925 --> 02:08:08.961
The General sends word,
he will meet your politician.

02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:13.930
- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.

02:08:23.735 --> 02:08:25.193
Leave us.

02:08:30.783 --> 02:08:32.491
Senator Gracchus.

02:08:46.299 --> 02:08:47.579
General.

02:08:48.676 --> 02:08:51.381
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough...

02:08:51.471 --> 02:08:54.590
that you can trust me.

02:08:58.936 --> 02:09:01.392
- The Senate is with you?
- The Senate?

02:09:02.899 --> 02:09:05.603
Yes. I can speak for them.

02:09:06.194 --> 02:09:09.563
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

02:09:09.906 --> 02:09:11.530
To what end?

02:09:12.825 --> 02:09:15.151
Get me outside the city walls.

02:09:15.745 --> 02:09:19.659
Have fresh horses ready to take me to Ostia.
My army is encamped there.

02:09:19.749 --> 02:09:23.082
By nightfall of the second day,
I'll return at the head of 5,000 men.

02:09:23.169 --> 02:09:25.375
But the legions
all have new commanders...

02:09:25.463 --> 02:09:26.874
loyal to Commodus.

02:09:26.964 --> 02:09:30.215
Let my men see me alive,
and you shall see where their loyalties lie.

02:09:30.301 --> 02:09:31.961
This is madness.

02:09:32.553 --> 02:09:35.887
<i>No Roman army has entered the capital
in 100 years.</i>

02:09:35.973 --> 02:09:38.215
I will not trade one dictatorship for another!

02:09:38.309 --> 02:09:41.844
The time for half measures and talk is over,
Senator.

02:09:42.355 --> 02:09:45.475
And after your glorious coup, what then?

02:09:46.692 --> 02:09:50.358
You'll take your 5,000 warriors and leave?

02:09:50.446 --> 02:09:51.940
I will leave.

02:09:52.448 --> 02:09:56.280
The soldiers will stay for your protection
under the command of the Senate.

02:09:56.369 --> 02:09:57.531
So...

02:09:57.870 --> 02:10:02.117
once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?

02:10:03.668 --> 02:10:05.127
Tell me why.

02:10:10.633 --> 02:10:13.753
Because that was the last wish
of a dying man.

02:10:16.806 --> 02:10:18.680
I will kill Commodus.

02:10:20.643 --> 02:10:23.679
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

02:10:25.565 --> 02:10:27.807
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

02:10:29.569 --> 02:10:31.608
His daughter trusts you.

02:10:35.616 --> 02:10:37.324
I will trust you.

02:10:37.702 --> 02:10:39.741
But we have little time.

02:10:40.288 --> 02:10:42.031
Give me two days...

02:10:42.832 --> 02:10:45.074
and I will buy your freedom.

02:10:45.793 --> 02:10:47.371
And you...

02:10:48.671 --> 02:10:50.296
You stay alive...

02:10:51.799 --> 02:10:53.459
or I'll be dead.

02:10:55.303 --> 02:10:56.880
<i>Now we must go.</i>

02:11:23.956 --> 02:11:27.539
He'll be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.

02:11:27.627 --> 02:11:29.204
He'll find you.

02:12:13.339 --> 02:12:14.833
It won't work.

02:12:15.883 --> 02:12:18.042
The Emperor knows too much.

02:12:19.053 --> 02:12:20.002
And as for me...

02:12:22.014 --> 02:12:24.091
it's becoming dangerous.

02:12:25.351 --> 02:12:27.593
You'll be paid on my return.

02:12:29.689 --> 02:12:31.480
I give you my word.

02:12:31.649 --> 02:12:34.733
Your word? What if you don't return?

02:12:36.070 --> 02:12:39.071
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

02:12:39.157 --> 02:12:40.355
Trust?

02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:46.364
Who am I to trust?

02:12:46.956 --> 02:12:50.491
I will kill Commodus.
Why would I want that?

02:12:50.918 --> 02:12:52.626
He makes me rich.

02:12:57.759 --> 02:13:00.594
I know that you are a man of your word,
General.

02:13:02.346 --> 02:13:04.968
I know that you would die
for honor.

02:13:06.267 --> 02:13:08.224
You would die for Rome.

02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:12.437
You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.

02:13:12.523 --> 02:13:14.849
But I, on the other hand...

02:13:17.528 --> 02:13:19.320
I'm an entertainer.

02:13:22.825 --> 02:13:24.023
Guard!

02:13:28.873 --> 02:13:31.446
He killed the man who set you free.

02:13:40.635 --> 02:13:42.462
Praetorians, master.

02:13:48.643 --> 02:13:49.888
Halt!

02:14:54.959 --> 02:14:56.952
Where have you been?

02:14:57.211 --> 02:14:58.955
I sent for you.

02:15:00.381 --> 02:15:02.041
Please, brother.

02:15:07.805 --> 02:15:09.679
What's troubling you?

02:15:12.101 --> 02:15:14.473
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

02:15:16.272 --> 02:15:17.897
I don't know.

02:15:19.776 --> 02:15:21.852
I thought you'd seen him.

02:15:22.737 --> 02:15:25.607
He infects everyone
like a putrid fever.

02:15:27.075 --> 02:15:30.278
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

02:15:30.703 --> 02:15:32.696
<i>And he will bleed, too.</i>

02:15:33.623 --> 02:15:34.998
Very soon.

02:15:36.501 --> 02:15:38.161
<i>But not tonight.</i>

02:15:53.184 --> 02:15:56.220
Do you remember
what our father said once?

02:15:57.480 --> 02:15:59.140
"It's a dream...

02:16:01.025 --> 02:16:02.899
"a frightful dream...

02:16:05.446 --> 02:16:06.822
"life is."

02:16:09.492 --> 02:16:11.568
Do you think that's true?

02:16:12.328 --> 02:16:13.822
I don't know.

02:16:17.458 --> 02:16:18.952
I think it is.

02:16:21.713 --> 02:16:24.417
And I have only you to share it with.

02:17:02.045 --> 02:17:03.621
Open your mouth.

02:17:40.958 --> 02:17:42.785
You know I love you.

02:17:44.837 --> 02:17:46.415
And I love you.

02:18:23.084 --> 02:18:24.708
Out. Get out!

02:18:25.837 --> 02:18:27.035
<i>Move!</i>

02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:33.877
Congratulations, General.

02:18:33.969 --> 02:18:36.805
You've got very persuasive friends.

02:18:42.687 --> 02:18:45.178
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

02:18:45.272 --> 02:18:48.606
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

02:18:48.817 --> 02:18:52.436
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

02:18:53.114 --> 02:18:56.779
Your servant, Cicero, will be waiting there
with horses.

02:18:58.786 --> 02:19:01.491
You have done all this?
Yes.

02:19:02.290 --> 02:19:03.998
You risk too much.

02:19:04.959 --> 02:19:06.951
I have much to pay for.

02:19:09.379 --> 02:19:11.587
You have nothing to pay for.

02:19:11.674 --> 02:19:14.758
You love your son. You're strong for him.

02:19:17.930 --> 02:19:20.338
I am tired of being strong.

02:19:22.393 --> 02:19:26.605
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.

02:19:26.981 --> 02:19:30.101
Because your father chose me.
No.

02:19:31.402 --> 02:19:33.691
Because my father loved you.

02:19:37.575 --> 02:19:39.983
And because I loved you.

02:19:42.580 --> 02:19:44.240
A long time ago.

02:19:49.003 --> 02:19:51.126
Was I very different then?

02:19:57.720 --> 02:19:59.512
You laughed more.

02:20:03.518 --> 02:20:05.925
I have felt alone all my life...

02:20:07.230 --> 02:20:08.890
except with you.

02:20:11.984 --> 02:20:13.479
I must go.

02:20:14.028 --> 02:20:15.143
Yes.

02:20:43.641 --> 02:20:44.839
There.

02:20:56.404 --> 02:20:57.946
And I got you.

02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:03.156
Isn't it late
to be playing legionnaire?

02:21:03.244 --> 02:21:05.118
I'm not a legionnaire.

02:21:05.371 --> 02:21:07.993
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

02:21:09.250 --> 02:21:10.709
A gladiator?

02:21:11.419 --> 02:21:13.992
Gladiators only fight in the games.

02:21:14.172 --> 02:21:17.588
Wouldn't you rather be
a great Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

02:21:17.675 --> 02:21:20.249
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

02:21:23.097 --> 02:21:24.924
The savior of Rome?

02:21:32.940 --> 02:21:34.684
And who said that?

02:21:43.493 --> 02:21:45.070
Where's Lucius?

02:21:46.329 --> 02:21:48.701
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

02:21:51.584 --> 02:21:53.327
She couldn't.
She did.

02:21:53.419 --> 02:21:55.578
She took it from a basket...

02:21:56.881 --> 02:22:00.665
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

02:22:02.470 --> 02:22:05.720
It bit her in the breast?
Yes.

02:22:06.432 --> 02:22:10.382
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies...

02:22:10.770 --> 02:22:14.850
behave very strangely
and do very odd things in the name of love.

02:22:14.941 --> 02:22:17.646
I think it's silly.
So do I.

02:22:21.406 --> 02:22:23.445
Sister, join us.

02:22:24.075 --> 02:22:25.818
I've been reading
to dear Lucius.

02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:27.950
I've been reading, too.
Yes.

02:22:28.037 --> 02:22:32.284
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

02:22:33.918 --> 02:22:37.702
We've been reading about the great
Mark Antony and his adventures in Egypt.

02:22:37.797 --> 02:22:40.335
And the queen killed herself with a snake.

02:22:40.425 --> 02:22:44.043
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

02:22:44.137 --> 02:22:48.633
If you're very good, tomorrow night
I'll tell you the story of Emperor Claudius.

02:22:49.892 --> 02:22:51.636
He was betrayed...

02:22:52.562 --> 02:22:54.685
by those closest to him.

02:22:56.566 --> 02:22:58.309
By his own blood.

02:22:59.652 --> 02:23:02.143
<i>They whispered in dark corners...</i>

02:23:02.238 --> 02:23:04.527
<i>and went out late at night...</i>

02:23:04.782 --> 02:23:08.116
and conspired, and conspired.

02:23:10.663 --> 02:23:14.577
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

02:23:14.667 --> 02:23:17.241
<i>He knew they were busy little bees.</i>

02:23:19.172 --> 02:23:22.256
And one night he sat down
with one of them...

02:23:23.009 --> 02:23:25.001
and he looked at her...

02:23:25.928 --> 02:23:27.471
and he said:

02:23:28.556 --> 02:23:31.094
"Tell me what you've been doing...

02:23:31.768 --> 02:23:33.511
"busy little bee.

02:23:35.813 --> 02:23:38.933
"Or I shall strike down those dearest to you.

02:23:40.068 --> 02:23:43.152
<i>"You shall watch as I bathe in their blood."</i>

02:23:46.741 --> 02:23:49.148
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

02:23:51.287 --> 02:23:56.163
The little bee had wounded him more deeply
than anyone else could ever have done.

02:23:58.378 --> 02:24:01.248
<i>What do you think happened then, Lucius?</i>

02:24:01.881 --> 02:24:03.708
I don't know, Uncle.

02:24:10.223 --> 02:24:12.796
The little bee told him everything.

02:25:10.867 --> 02:25:13.951
Open,
in the name of the Emperor!

02:25:14.537 --> 02:25:15.817
<i>Proximo!</i>

02:25:16.706 --> 02:25:19.909
<i>Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!</i>

02:25:24.213 --> 02:25:25.672
Open the gates!

02:25:31.512 --> 02:25:33.801
<i>Open the gates, Proximo.</i>

02:25:34.265 --> 02:25:36.507
<i>Do you want to die, old man?</i>

02:25:37.727 --> 02:25:38.842
Here.

02:25:39.479 --> 02:25:41.555
Everything is prepared.

02:25:41.647 --> 02:25:44.138
It seems you have won your freedom.

02:25:44.233 --> 02:25:47.816
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

02:25:52.909 --> 02:25:56.741
- Juba.
- All enemies of the emperor die!

02:25:57.288 --> 02:25:59.446
<i>Open the gates!</i>

02:26:04.962 --> 02:26:06.920
Pull!

02:26:09.092 --> 02:26:11.927
Move!
Form a column on the left!

02:26:15.723 --> 02:26:18.760
I only need moments,
so do not be careless with your lives.

02:26:18.851 --> 02:26:21.603
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

02:26:21.687 --> 02:26:23.846
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

02:26:23.940 --> 02:26:26.810
Strength and honor.
Go.

02:26:27.693 --> 02:26:29.520
Strength and honor.

02:26:32.156 --> 02:26:34.991
Aim. Arch your bows!

02:27:42.101 --> 02:27:43.382
Shadows and dust.

02:28:25.311 --> 02:28:26.426
Maximus!

02:28:32.026 --> 02:28:33.437
I'm sorry.

02:28:59.846 --> 02:29:01.221
It's done.

02:29:08.187 --> 02:29:10.263
And what of my nephew?

02:29:11.149 --> 02:29:13.141
And what of his mother?

02:29:15.194 --> 02:29:17.768
Should they share her lover's fate?

02:29:19.490 --> 02:29:21.530
Or should I be merciful?

02:29:24.245 --> 02:29:26.154
Commodus the Merciful.

02:29:32.628 --> 02:29:34.917
Lucius will stay with me now.

02:29:36.049 --> 02:29:37.875
And if his mother...

02:29:39.302 --> 02:29:41.378
so much as looks at me...

02:29:42.555 --> 02:29:45.046
in a manner that displeases me...

02:29:47.018 --> 02:29:48.477
he will die.

02:29:51.898 --> 02:29:55.183
If she decides to be noble...

02:29:56.944 --> 02:29:59.020
and takes her own life...

02:30:00.615 --> 02:30:02.074
he will die.

02:30:05.703 --> 02:30:07.530
And as for you...

02:30:10.249 --> 02:30:12.041
you will love me...

02:30:12.752 --> 02:30:14.579
as I have loved you.

02:30:16.172 --> 02:30:19.837
You will provide me
with an heir of pure blood...

02:30:20.843 --> 02:30:22.635
so that Commodus...

02:30:23.221 --> 02:30:26.175
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

02:30:30.812 --> 02:30:32.555
Am I not merciful?

02:30:54.419 --> 02:30:57.040
Am I not merciful!

02:31:09.267 --> 02:31:12.470
Maximus!

02:31:40.715 --> 02:31:43.467
I'm a soldier. I obey.

02:31:46.179 --> 02:31:50.473
Nothing happens to anyone
that he is not fitted by nature to bear.

02:32:23.424 --> 02:32:24.705
Maximus!

02:32:31.099 --> 02:32:33.008
They call for you.

02:32:34.894 --> 02:32:38.144
The general
who became a slave.

02:32:39.399 --> 02:32:41.806
The slave who became a gladiator.

02:32:43.152 --> 02:32:45.987
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

02:32:47.907 --> 02:32:49.615
A striking story.

02:32:50.785 --> 02:32:54.070
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

02:32:56.374 --> 02:32:58.616
Only a famous death will do.

02:33:00.545 --> 02:33:03.083
And what could be more glorious...

02:33:03.464 --> 02:33:07.213
than to challenge the Emperor himself
in the great arena?

02:33:09.554 --> 02:33:12.590
You would fight me?
Why not?

02:33:13.808 --> 02:33:15.847
Do you think I'm afraid?

02:33:16.644 --> 02:33:19.645
I think you have been afraid all your life.

02:33:19.772 --> 02:33:23.473
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:32.276
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all.

02:33:33.536 --> 02:33:35.992
"All a man can do is smile back."

02:33:37.790 --> 02:33:39.201
I wonder...

02:33:39.834 --> 02:33:42.621
did your friend smile at his own death?

02:33:43.004 --> 02:33:44.546
You must know.

02:33:47.425 --> 02:33:49.216
He was your father.

02:33:53.097 --> 02:33:55.422
You loved my father, I know...

02:33:56.934 --> 02:33:58.429
but so did I.

02:34:00.063 --> 02:34:02.636
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

02:34:05.276 --> 02:34:07.399
Smile for me now, brother.

02:34:12.909 --> 02:34:15.696
Strap on his armor. Conceal the wound.

02:35:10.133 --> 02:35:12.090
Ring formation!

02:37:03.913 --> 02:37:05.491
Quintus, sword.

02:37:06.999 --> 02:37:08.791
Give me your sword.

02:37:12.213 --> 02:37:14.206
Sword! Give me a sword!

02:37:15.717 --> 02:37:17.543
Sheathe your swords.

02:39:34.731 --> 02:39:36.141
Maximus.

02:39:43.281 --> 02:39:44.609
Quintus.

02:39:46.284 --> 02:39:47.743
Free my men.

02:39:49.203 --> 02:39:51.908
Senator Gracchus
is to be reinstated.

02:39:53.124 --> 02:39:55.200
There was a dream that was Rome.

02:39:55.877 --> 02:39:57.750
<i>It shall be realized.</i>

02:39:58.504 --> 02:40:01.078
These are the wishes of Marcus Aurelius.

02:40:01.966 --> 02:40:04.042
Free the prisoners. Go!

02:40:28.743 --> 02:40:30.023
Maximus.

02:40:31.954 --> 02:40:33.532
Lucius is safe.

02:40:49.847 --> 02:40:51.258
Go to them.

02:41:41.065 --> 02:41:42.524
You're home.

02:42:09.135 --> 02:42:11.708
Is Rome worth one good man's life?

02:42:15.558 --> 02:42:17.385
We believed it once.

02:42:20.563 --> 02:42:22.639
Make us believe it again.

02:42:26.194 --> 02:42:28.270
He was a soldier of Rome.

02:42:32.116 --> 02:42:33.527
Honor him.

02:42:33.993 --> 02:42:36.152
Who will help me carry him?

02:43:20.915 --> 02:43:22.575
Now we are free.

02:43:28.965 --> 02:43:30.839
I will see you again.

02:43:33.720 --> 02:43:35.178
But not yet.

02:43:36.180 --> 02:43:37.509
Not yet.
