jealously.

>> Gumball: And acting on
impulse, you attacked him.

>> Aah!
>> Gumball: You frantically
plucked out all of his hair,

04:53.260 --> 04:56.695
dyed it the right color, and
used it to cover your balding
shame.

04:56.697 --> 05:01.099
Then, planning to mislead any
investigation, you painted
principal brown, wrapped him in

05:01.101 --> 05:06.938

into my locker -- the perfect
crime, save for<i> one</i> thing!

new hair on your body, there

sweaty.
