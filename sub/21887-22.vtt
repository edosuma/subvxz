WEBVTT

00:00.898 --> 00:02.602
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

00:02.664 --> 00:04.897
Hugo Strange can fix Butch.

00:04.932 --> 00:07.814
Strange might be my only hope, Tabby.

00:07.874 --> 00:10.175
Whatever happens
after I walk out that door,

00:10.246 --> 00:12.112
I care about you,

00:12.137 --> 00:13.636
and I always will.

00:13.672 --> 00:14.971
JEREMIAH: Jerome is dead.

00:15.006 --> 00:16.439
Long live me.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.541
(explosion)

00:18.577 --> 00:19.709
Oh, my God!

00:19.744 --> 00:21.911
I have bombs planted around the city.

00:21.947 --> 00:23.580
GORDON: These are the buildings
Jeremiah's planning

00:23.615 --> 00:24.948
to demolish with his bombs.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.616
Once those buildings are blown,

00:26.651 --> 00:28.918
they collapse and create the labyrinth
from the finished drawing.

00:29.262 --> 00:30.658
GORDON: I have the locations

00:30.683 --> 00:32.555
of every bomb Jeremiah planted.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.093
How did they beat you, huh?

00:37.128 --> 00:38.461
I'll have to start again.

00:38.497 --> 00:39.762
RA'S AL GHUL: I had a vision.

00:39.798 --> 00:42.232
Of Gotham in flames.

00:42.267 --> 00:43.233
Together,

00:43.268 --> 00:44.567
we can make that happen.

00:44.603 --> 00:45.735
Now listen closely

00:45.770 --> 00:47.003
to what you must do.

00:47.038 --> 00:48.771
(gunshot)

00:50.542 --> 00:51.508
Hold on, Selina.

00:51.543 --> 00:53.576
(Alfred grunting)

00:54.455 --> 00:57.213
(Bruce muttering) It's okay. It's okay.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.517
- Make way.
- We'll do everything we can,

01:00.552 --> 01:02.952
but the evacuation has us
dealing with a skeleton crew.

01:02.988 --> 01:04.953
- Bruce.
- Selina.

01:04.989 --> 01:06.456
I'm right here. You're at the hospital.

01:06.491 --> 01:07.757
You're gonna be okay.

01:07.792 --> 01:09.425
Are you gonna leave me?

01:09.461 --> 01:11.027
No.

01:11.062 --> 01:12.462
No, I'm gonna be right here.

01:12.497 --> 01:13.997
You promise?

01:14.929 --> 01:16.929
I promise.

01:23.671 --> 01:26.271
(metal clanging)

01:33.326 --> 01:35.490
You know, I don't know
why I brought him here.

01:36.050 --> 01:39.051
I should've killed him
when I had the chance.

01:39.312 --> 01:40.978
You did the right thing, Alfred.

01:41.053 --> 01:42.187
You say that.

01:42.222 --> 01:44.556
You didn't see what he did to Selina.

01:46.293 --> 01:47.759
Right. I better get to the hospital.

01:47.795 --> 01:49.695
I'll stop by when I can.

01:49.730 --> 01:51.695
Alfred.

01:52.232 --> 01:54.199
He couldn't have put
a cap in that psycho,

01:54.234 --> 01:56.335
- done the world a favor?
- Where are we?

01:56.370 --> 01:58.355
Bomb squad's at the
last site on the map.

01:58.402 --> 01:59.871
After they disarm the
bomb, they're gonna put it

01:59.907 --> 02:01.039
in a warehouse with all the others.

02:01.075 --> 02:02.708
Also, the mayor called.

02:02.743 --> 02:04.760
He wants to lift the evacuation order.

02:04.807 --> 02:06.244
Tell him we're not doing anything

02:06.280 --> 02:08.747
until we have all the bombs locked away.

02:10.306 --> 02:12.057
Pardon me, Jim.

02:17.658 --> 02:19.625
Don't you all have work to do?

02:20.995 --> 02:22.961
(indistinct muttering)

02:25.065 --> 02:26.632
What is it?

02:26.667 --> 02:29.502
I'd like to press charges
against Bruce Wayne's butler.

02:30.731 --> 02:33.065
I mean, just look at my face.

02:33.132 --> 02:34.388
I think you look great.

02:34.442 --> 02:37.709
And I'd like to speak to Bruce again.

02:37.745 --> 02:39.244
We couldn't really talk before,

02:39.279 --> 02:42.247
what with his girlfriend
bleeding out all over him.

02:44.351 --> 02:47.552
You tried to prove
you're better than your brother.

02:47.588 --> 02:49.554
But I'm still here.

02:49.590 --> 02:51.289
The city's still here.

02:51.325 --> 02:53.492
You're a failure, Jeremiah.

02:54.157 --> 02:55.460
Enjoy Arkham.

02:55.496 --> 02:57.629
Your brother did. Put him in the box.

02:57.665 --> 02:59.112
Get him ready for transport.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.776
Bring me Bruce Wayne, and I'll tell you
where the other bombs are.

03:03.137 --> 03:04.803
We have all your bombs.

03:04.838 --> 03:06.605
The maze bombs, yes.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.441
I mean the other ones.

03:10.644 --> 03:11.943
Jim...

03:12.464 --> 03:15.347
as an engineer, you expect systems

03:15.382 --> 03:16.682
to fail, so...

03:16.717 --> 03:18.782
you build in redundancies.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.790
And I am a very good engineer.

03:24.625 --> 03:26.925
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

03:27.553 --> 03:30.885
How many lives are you willing to bet?

03:31.498 --> 03:33.131
You're right, you know.

03:33.775 --> 03:35.634
I did fail.

03:35.669 --> 03:38.410
I didn't yet understand
the vision I was servicing,

03:38.435 --> 03:40.539
but I do now.

03:40.574 --> 03:44.122
My eyes are open, as will yours be.

03:48.549 --> 03:50.949
When you realize I'm not bluffing,

03:50.984 --> 03:53.122
bring me Bruce Wayne.

03:53.854 --> 03:55.721
And I'd like a coffee.

03:55.756 --> 03:59.057
Black. Two sugars.

03:59.093 --> 04:00.392
(sustained beeping)

04:00.427 --> 04:03.165
No heartbeat.

04:03.697 --> 04:06.531
Extraordinary.

04:07.215 --> 04:08.814
This better work.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.902
The chemicals
that turned him into this...

04:11.557 --> 04:13.872
beautiful specimen

04:13.907 --> 04:16.975
kept his organs surprisingly
well preserved.

04:17.010 --> 04:20.545
Once we flush his body with antitoxin,

04:20.581 --> 04:21.913
we'll top him off

04:21.949 --> 04:23.849
- with some fresh blood.
- (whimpering)

04:23.884 --> 04:26.752
And a quick jolt to the heart

04:26.787 --> 04:29.781
will see him good as new.

04:34.394 --> 04:36.528
You hear that?

04:36.563 --> 04:38.163
You're gonna be cured.

04:38.198 --> 04:40.122
- Yeah.
- (phone ringing)

04:43.251 --> 04:45.417
What?

04:45.500 --> 04:46.709
When?

04:46.807 --> 04:48.340
What is it?

04:49.211 --> 04:51.676
Selina's been shot
by that lunatic Jeremiah.

04:51.712 --> 04:52.911
She's at Gotham General.

04:52.946 --> 04:54.846
I have to go. I'll be back.

04:54.882 --> 04:56.081
Of course.

04:56.116 --> 04:57.682
You go check on the kid.

04:57.718 --> 04:59.684
What? No, she's in surgery.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.186
I'm gonna kill Jeremiah.

05:01.221 --> 05:02.728
I'll come with you.

05:02.813 --> 05:04.623
- I don't advise that. The procedure
- (groans)

05:04.649 --> 05:06.610
should not be interrupted.

05:06.727 --> 05:08.392
Stay.

05:08.495 --> 05:10.853
I'll be here...

05:11.098 --> 05:13.799
making sure everything goes as planned.

05:14.639 --> 05:18.509
I'm doing this for Butch, not for you.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.141
(softly): It's okay.

05:30.484 --> 05:32.450
(siren wailing in distance)

05:34.154 --> 05:35.754
Unfortunately, there's no telling

05:35.789 --> 05:38.223
just how many battery bombs
Jeremiah produced.

05:38.258 --> 05:40.692
He was fanatically secret
about his technology,

05:40.727 --> 05:41.827
and Bruce trusted him, so...

05:41.862 --> 05:43.829
He's gotta be bluffing.

05:43.864 --> 05:45.363
- (knock on door)
- Yeah?

05:45.399 --> 05:47.532
Cap, mayor's on the phone again.

05:47.568 --> 05:49.134
The evacuation stays in effect.

05:49.169 --> 05:50.815
I will tell him when it's lifted.

05:52.306 --> 05:53.638
LUCIUS: <i>You think there are more bombs?</i>

05:53.674 --> 05:56.341
Up till now, Jeremiah's actions sprang

05:56.376 --> 05:58.410
from the fear and hatred of his brother.

05:58.445 --> 05:59.678
Even his obsession with Bruce

05:59.713 --> 06:01.954
is just a reflection of Jerome's.

06:02.728 --> 06:04.249
What did he mean when he said

06:04.284 --> 06:06.918
he didn't understand
the vision he was serving?

06:06.954 --> 06:09.154
That his eyes had been opened?

06:10.891 --> 06:12.324
YORK: Perhaps the previous mayor

06:12.359 --> 06:14.025
took orders from a police captain.

06:14.061 --> 06:16.161
- Sir, Captain Gordon is...
- Jim Gordon is not

06:16.196 --> 06:18.597
the mayor of Gotham; I am.

06:18.632 --> 06:21.466
The people need to know
the city is safe.

06:21.501 --> 06:22.651
I'm lifting the order.

06:25.190 --> 06:26.605
What are you looking at?

06:26.640 --> 06:28.039
There's a man on the building

06:28.075 --> 06:29.841
across the street, staring at us.

06:29.877 --> 06:30.842
What?

06:59.172 --> 07:01.006
How many bombs are there?

07:01.041 --> 07:02.340
Where are they?

07:02.376 --> 07:04.576
I want to talk to Bruce Wayne.

07:04.611 --> 07:06.011
(grunts)

07:06.046 --> 07:08.449
Tell me where they are,
you son of a bitch.

07:08.512 --> 07:11.301
- Who's helping you?
- Bruce Wayne.

07:12.552 --> 07:16.021
You are never gonna talk
to Bruce Wayne, you hear me?!

07:16.056 --> 07:18.657
Then more people will die. (chuckles)

07:18.692 --> 07:21.259
But you never were good at holding on

07:21.295 --> 07:23.571
to what you care about, were you, James?

07:25.028 --> 07:26.264
BULLOCK: Jim!

07:26.760 --> 07:28.559
We need you out here now!

07:30.938 --> 07:32.904
(humming Beethoven's "Ode to Joy")

07:32.940 --> 07:34.906
♪ ♪

07:43.050 --> 07:44.182
Can I help you?

07:44.217 --> 07:45.784
Captain Gordon.

07:45.819 --> 07:48.720
Major Rodney Harlan,
Seventh Division, Fort Henry.

07:48.755 --> 07:51.723
Major, I assume you're here
to help with the evacuation.

07:51.758 --> 07:53.408
If so, Detective Bullock can coordinate.

07:53.439 --> 07:55.193
The governor has declared martial law.

07:55.228 --> 07:58.596
Until this crisis is resolved,
I'm in charge here.

07:59.887 --> 08:02.137
- Are you serious?
- Son, this is not a pissing match.

08:02.184 --> 08:04.235
I was sent here to restore order

08:04.271 --> 08:06.152
in a chaotic situation.

08:06.473 --> 08:08.406
Can I count on you?

08:10.143 --> 08:11.476
Yes, sir.

08:11.511 --> 08:14.112
- What do we got?
- Not much. (sighs)

08:14.147 --> 08:15.413
Valeska had a plan to knock down

08:15.449 --> 08:16.948
a number of buildings in Gotham.

08:16.984 --> 08:18.216
We recovered those bombs,

08:18.251 --> 08:19.584
but he stashed away more.

08:19.619 --> 08:21.586
Who's helping him? Somebody's got to be.

08:21.621 --> 08:22.587
It's unclear.

08:22.622 --> 08:24.289
We've heard reports that

08:24.324 --> 08:25.790
his followers have turned on him,

08:25.826 --> 08:28.112
which would indicate
he has someone else.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.104
He would like to talk to Bruce Wayne.

08:30.129 --> 08:31.663
That's clearly a trap.

08:31.698 --> 08:33.097
His brother pulled the same gag.

08:33.133 --> 08:34.566
There was a blimp, it was a whole thing.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.068
We'll make sure he's safe.
Get me Bruce Wayne.

08:37.104 --> 08:38.860
Major, you cannot bring
Bruce Wayne down here.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.772
This is not your call, Captain.

08:41.485 --> 08:43.767
- Now.
- SOLDIER: Yes, sir.

08:44.010 --> 08:45.243
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

08:45.278 --> 08:46.845
Arrest Captain Gordon.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.780
- That's not necessary.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

08:48.815 --> 08:50.815
- Are you out of your freakin' mind?!
- You listen to me!

08:50.851 --> 08:52.484
This city is holding on by a thread.

08:52.519 --> 08:55.120
I will not allow anything
to jeopardize it further,

08:55.155 --> 08:57.389
including insubordination.

08:57.424 --> 08:58.906
Escort Captain Gordon across the river.

08:58.945 --> 09:00.191
Hold him there until you hear from me.

09:00.227 --> 09:02.193
Get me Bruce Wayne.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.867
(soldiers grunt)

09:10.614 --> 09:13.838
I strike where you lie,
death's gentle cousin...

09:13.874 --> 09:15.473
The answer's sleep, Ed.

09:15.509 --> 09:17.542
(Gordon grunts)

09:19.146 --> 09:21.279
It's polite to let people finish.

09:32.674 --> 09:35.033
Rise and shine!

09:35.567 --> 09:37.333
Good morning, sweetheart.

09:37.478 --> 09:40.754
I know... waking up
in the Narrows, a prisoner.

09:40.838 --> 09:42.715
Must feel like history repeating itself.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.217
- Ed...
- Speaking of history,

09:44.252 --> 09:46.301
remember when you
punched me in the face?

09:46.372 --> 09:49.107
(groaning)

09:49.150 --> 09:51.207
Ah, that felt good.

09:54.122 --> 09:57.902
Listen to me, Jeremiah Valeska
has more bombs.

09:57.949 --> 10:00.083
- You have to...
- I have to what, Jim?

10:00.920 --> 10:03.696
Set you free? Help save the city?

10:03.731 --> 10:06.669
Well, we've been there,
done that, and guess what.

10:06.694 --> 10:09.935
Shocker! Lee and I are still fugitives.

10:09.971 --> 10:11.804
I offered her a way out.

10:11.839 --> 10:13.585
Oh, by returning the money?

10:13.617 --> 10:16.015
She's dispersed that among all
the deadbeats of the Narrows.

10:16.046 --> 10:17.468
Not exactly what I would've done,

10:17.499 --> 10:19.507
but point is, it's gone.

10:19.550 --> 10:22.647
Now, on with the show! We're a little...

10:22.682 --> 10:24.812
(clicks tongue) pressed for time.

10:24.899 --> 10:27.000
- (chuckling)
- (machine humming)

10:27.035 --> 10:29.002
Ed.

10:29.398 --> 10:33.213
Ed. Ed, wait. Ed...

10:33.642 --> 10:35.242
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Ed!

10:35.277 --> 10:38.378
- This is 50 pounds of pressure.
- Ed...

10:38.413 --> 10:40.647
What are you doing?

10:40.682 --> 10:43.116
(speaking French)
<i>Une peine forte et dure.</i>

10:43.407 --> 10:45.418
Well, it's my own version of it, anyway.

10:45.465 --> 10:47.965
You see, in the old days,
they used to pile weights

10:47.997 --> 10:50.063
on a prisoner's chest

10:50.092 --> 10:51.892
to try to get a confession.

10:51.927 --> 10:53.160
Usually, they just died.

10:53.195 --> 10:54.327
That's a hundred pounds.

10:54.363 --> 10:55.462
(Gordon groans)

10:57.329 --> 10:58.978
Why?

10:59.033 --> 11:02.302
To help Lee break free from her history.

11:02.337 --> 11:04.380
You see, she has this anchor,

11:04.732 --> 11:06.740
dead weight, holding her to her past,

11:07.013 --> 11:08.479
and that's you.

11:08.568 --> 11:09.693
Once you're gone,

11:09.772 --> 11:11.623
she'll finally be free to be the person

11:11.658 --> 11:15.240
she was meant to be,
the person I want her to be.

11:15.271 --> 11:16.429
(whirs)

11:16.454 --> 11:18.320
- (groaning)
- 150.

11:19.399 --> 11:21.233
You see, I saw you together.

11:21.701 --> 11:23.802
I saw the way she looked at you.

11:23.837 --> 11:26.138
So for her sake, you're gonna die.

11:26.173 --> 11:28.222
And for my sake,

11:28.745 --> 11:30.142
you're gonna suffer.

11:30.184 --> 11:31.950
(whirring)

11:31.979 --> 11:35.152
- (groans)
- Oh, this is gonna be so much fun.

11:35.191 --> 11:37.249
(laughs)

11:37.284 --> 11:39.951
(car horn honking, siren wailing)

11:40.347 --> 11:43.391
This evacuation's gonna leave
a lot of territory undefended.

11:43.519 --> 11:45.610
A shame not to capitalize.

11:47.661 --> 11:49.761
(grunting, blows landing)

11:52.551 --> 11:54.213
Hello, Barbara.

11:55.994 --> 11:57.727
- (panting)
- I was only hoping to talk.

11:57.752 --> 11:59.304
By attacking my people?

11:59.350 --> 12:02.251
- Call it a precaution.
- What do you want?

12:02.276 --> 12:06.311
I'm leaving Gotham,
and I want you to come with me.

12:06.346 --> 12:08.280
(scoffs) Try again.

12:08.315 --> 12:12.751
I had a vision when I took back
the Demon's Head...

12:12.786 --> 12:16.655
death, destruction, the city in flames.

12:17.215 --> 12:18.830
But it didn't come to be.

12:18.879 --> 12:21.159
- How disappointing for you.
- Indeed.

12:21.195 --> 12:24.019
For many reasons.
Not least is that for centuries,

12:24.082 --> 12:25.630
I have depended
on the Demon's Head to get ahead

12:25.666 --> 12:29.134
of my enemies, but without the
full measure of its power...

12:29.159 --> 12:30.712
Wait.

12:30.861 --> 12:33.641
Are you saying you think
some of it might still be in me?

12:35.209 --> 12:37.457
Interesting.

12:37.731 --> 12:39.886
So I guess you're here
to kill me for it?

12:39.970 --> 12:41.936
You misunderstand.

12:42.410 --> 12:43.949
Remember the woman from the tapestry?

12:43.984 --> 12:45.383
The one whose features you share?

12:45.419 --> 12:48.577
The whore you murdered?
How could I forget?

12:48.629 --> 12:52.231
I lied to get under your skin.

12:52.741 --> 12:54.459
I loved her.

12:54.494 --> 12:56.461
Very much.

12:57.220 --> 13:00.332
I offered her eternity,
but she turned it down.

13:01.462 --> 13:05.503
And now I make you the same offer.

13:05.689 --> 13:10.141
Join me, and we will rule
the League of Shadows together.

13:12.275 --> 13:14.213
Think about it.

13:17.204 --> 13:20.238
What about your vision?
The city on fire?

13:20.297 --> 13:23.054
I am making certain of it even now.

13:23.090 --> 13:26.224
Its destruction will give rise
to the one I foresaw long ago,

13:26.961 --> 13:28.827
the one who brought me here,

13:29.150 --> 13:30.896
my heir.

13:34.101 --> 13:36.501
(indistinct chatter, phones ringing)

13:36.536 --> 13:39.170
Oh, Bullock? Bullock,
can you tell these punks

13:39.206 --> 13:40.325
to let us go, please?

13:40.395 --> 13:42.864
Major, the men escorting
Gordon were attacked.

13:42.934 --> 13:44.075
Your guys didn't see who.

13:44.111 --> 13:45.629
I'm thinking it's either
Valeska's cultists or...

13:45.654 --> 13:48.079
Enough. Did you prepare
Valeska like I asked?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.077
Yeah.

13:50.217 --> 13:52.951
Mr. Wayne, you'll be perfectly safe.

13:52.986 --> 13:54.886
If you can help us learn
the location of the bombs...

13:54.922 --> 13:56.454
BRUCE: Major, you brought
me here against my will.

13:57.038 --> 14:01.159
I want to go back to the
hospital and back to my friend.

14:01.226 --> 14:02.826
Let's get this over with.

14:19.350 --> 14:20.946
<i>Hello, Bruce.</i>

14:22.182 --> 14:24.115
It's great to see you.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.945
Where are the bombs, Jeremiah?

14:29.058 --> 14:30.848
Closer, please.

14:35.362 --> 14:37.087
Closer.

14:38.498 --> 14:40.298
Tell me.

14:41.063 --> 14:42.957
How is the young lady doing?

14:45.205 --> 14:47.145
Well.

14:47.674 --> 14:49.294
Hmm.

14:50.911 --> 14:53.402
You know why we're destined
to be best friends?

14:54.409 --> 14:56.597
Because we're very much alike.

14:56.636 --> 14:58.472
You are as I used to be...

14:58.511 --> 15:00.800
at war with your true nature.

15:01.154 --> 15:04.452
You must truly embrace it
if you ever want to be free.

15:04.477 --> 15:06.045
I'm just trying to help you.

15:06.104 --> 15:08.084
Trying to help me.

15:10.366 --> 15:12.130
By torturing Alfred?

15:13.734 --> 15:16.835
Trying to destroy Gotham?
By shooting Selina?

15:16.870 --> 15:18.803
You think we're alike

15:18.839 --> 15:21.339
because there's a darkness
inside both of us.

15:21.375 --> 15:24.809
But the difference is,
I know how to control mine.

15:25.460 --> 15:28.851
I think you could be so strong.

15:29.351 --> 15:31.374
I see it.

15:33.257 --> 15:35.020
He sees it, too.

15:38.288 --> 15:40.325
What do you mean, "he"?

15:43.044 --> 15:45.373
Ask him about the bombs.

15:46.234 --> 15:48.310
Where are the other bombs?

15:50.903 --> 15:52.481
What bombs?

15:53.807 --> 15:56.007
BRUCE: <i>The bombs you've
planted around the city.</i>

15:56.043 --> 15:57.909
- You blew up the mayor.
- Ah.

15:57.944 --> 16:00.412
That bomb. Yes, that was the only one.

16:00.439 --> 16:02.739
But it did what it had to.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.150
It got you here.

16:06.558 --> 16:08.715
Well, that's enough.
I want my boy out, mate.

16:09.489 --> 16:11.423
You said "he."

16:13.355 --> 16:15.389
Who do you mean?

16:15.440 --> 16:17.095
The one who opened up my eyes,
who showed me

16:17.130 --> 16:19.608
that everything I was doing was not

16:19.633 --> 16:22.667
to create a Gotham of my own, but yours.

16:23.719 --> 16:25.158
The Gotham

16:25.272 --> 16:26.594
you need.

16:26.649 --> 16:28.373
Your dark island.

16:28.408 --> 16:31.063
And it will come to be, Bruce.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.111
Tonight.

16:35.082 --> 16:36.881
Tell me his name.

16:36.917 --> 16:38.283
What did the doctor say?

16:38.318 --> 16:40.946
Will the little bitch ever walk again?

16:41.001 --> 16:42.854
What vertebrae did I sever?

16:42.889 --> 16:44.355
I was hoping for the lumbar.

16:44.391 --> 16:46.540
Tell me his name!

16:48.095 --> 16:49.894
But you already know his name.

16:49.930 --> 16:51.891
You're his heir.

16:52.938 --> 16:54.689
Ra's al Ghul.

16:55.135 --> 16:57.869
- No, it can't be.
- Shh.

16:57.904 --> 16:59.471
(man screams)

16:59.506 --> 17:01.005
- Bullock.
- Yeah.

17:16.638 --> 17:20.646
350 pounds of pressure.

17:20.701 --> 17:22.800
- (grunts)
- Getting hard to breathe?

17:22.869 --> 17:24.837
- (grunts)
- I'll take that as a yes.

17:24.872 --> 17:26.305
You know, if we listen carefully,

17:26.339 --> 17:28.244
we can hear some ribs cracking soon.

17:28.291 --> 17:29.341
(laughs)

17:29.377 --> 17:31.280
450.

17:32.647 --> 17:34.042
Healthy male adult.

17:34.067 --> 17:35.466
His ribs should be able to take

17:35.491 --> 17:37.082
about 450 pounds before they crack.

17:37.118 --> 17:38.417
(groans)

17:40.321 --> 17:42.411
Did you think you could
hide this from me, Ed?

17:42.436 --> 17:45.153
I'm Queen of the Narrows,
people tell me things.

17:45.185 --> 17:46.365
I know how this looks.

17:46.394 --> 17:47.912
It looks like you're trying
to crush Jim to death

17:47.960 --> 17:49.904
because you think we still
have feelings for each other.

17:50.064 --> 17:54.033
Well, perhaps we should jump
to why this is a good thing.

17:54.068 --> 17:55.367
I can't wait.

17:55.403 --> 17:56.835
He's holding you back.

17:56.871 --> 17:58.404
From?

17:58.439 --> 18:02.708
From being the person
that you are meant to be.

18:03.911 --> 18:05.711
The woman that I love.

18:07.014 --> 18:09.882
You really think so little of me?

18:10.559 --> 18:12.318
- I don't follow that.
- How weak would

18:12.353 --> 18:15.321
that person need to be if
Jim Gordon could hold her back?

18:15.356 --> 18:16.889
It's actually insulting.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.258
That's not what I intended. I...

18:19.293 --> 18:20.492
Enough.

18:20.528 --> 18:22.388
Yesterday,

18:22.830 --> 18:25.464
you said a part of you
would always care for me.

18:25.499 --> 18:27.232
The woman you loved is gone.

18:27.268 --> 18:28.734
Understand?

18:30.636 --> 18:32.206
Yes.

18:34.275 --> 18:37.209
The Narrows is free
from landlords and gangs.

18:37.244 --> 18:40.079
Every family has money
to build their life.

18:40.114 --> 18:42.047
I'm done. I'm leaving.

18:42.703 --> 18:44.249
I want you to come with me,

18:44.285 --> 18:46.685
but if you kill Jim, don't bother.

18:47.328 --> 18:49.421
And I will decide who I'm going to be.

18:49.457 --> 18:52.658
Not you, not Jim Gordon. Me.

18:52.693 --> 18:54.259
I'm leaving tonight.

18:55.112 --> 18:56.925
It's your choice.

19:08.531 --> 19:10.508
She chose me, Jim.

19:12.079 --> 19:14.072
Did you hear that?

19:15.001 --> 19:16.869
That's all I wanted.

19:18.019 --> 19:19.885
You can have Gotham.

19:25.426 --> 19:27.393
Uh... (grunts)

19:27.428 --> 19:28.460
TABITHA: By the time I got there,

19:28.496 --> 19:29.795
Jeremiah had already escaped.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.764
Right. Where the hell is Ra's al Ghul?

19:31.799 --> 19:33.465
Alfred. Let me guess.

19:33.501 --> 19:35.934
Ra's helped Jeremiah kidnap Bruce,

19:35.970 --> 19:37.736
so you came to me to find Ra's.

19:37.772 --> 19:39.138
Would you care to tell me where he is?

19:39.173 --> 19:40.472
I don't know where he is.

19:40.508 --> 19:42.474
But I know where he's gonna be.

19:42.510 --> 19:43.942
Ra's is leaving Gotham tonight,

19:43.978 --> 19:45.978
after turning it to a pile of rubble.

19:46.013 --> 19:48.580
With, I assume, Jeremiah's
help, so here's the deal.

19:48.616 --> 19:50.009
You get to kill Jeremiah,

19:50.056 --> 19:51.717
you get to rescue Bruce

19:51.752 --> 19:53.819
and I get to kill Ra's.

19:53.854 --> 19:55.668
And how do you plan on doing that, then?

19:57.145 --> 19:59.091
I got a little surprise for him.

19:59.126 --> 20:00.692
OSWALD: One question.

20:02.613 --> 20:04.855
Who do I get to kill?

20:06.267 --> 20:08.097
The only way to keep Butch on the table

20:08.125 --> 20:10.214
was to promise I would come help.

20:10.246 --> 20:11.804
Well.

20:13.107 --> 20:15.427
Don't we make quite the little gang?

20:16.677 --> 20:18.644
Let's do this.

20:22.283 --> 20:24.249
(panting)

20:26.887 --> 20:28.610
Hey.

20:30.925 --> 20:32.691
My car's around the corner.

20:33.228 --> 20:35.194
You're gonna want to ice those ribs.

20:36.273 --> 20:38.330
Is it true, about you leaving Gotham?

20:38.365 --> 20:39.531
Yes.

20:39.567 --> 20:40.733
And taking Ed with you?

20:41.140 --> 20:42.968
That's none of your concern.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.720
Back in the GCPD, when I told
you there was so much

20:47.745 --> 20:49.908
I wished I could change,
you asked me what I meant.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.681
- Jim...
- I would change everything

20:51.706 --> 20:53.378
that brought us to this point.

20:54.362 --> 20:56.283
I would ask you to leave Gotham with me

20:56.351 --> 20:58.016
that first moment I saw you,

20:58.052 --> 20:59.685
and I would make sure
we had a life together.

21:01.255 --> 21:03.255
Then you wouldn't be you.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.724
Maybe that'd be a good thing.

21:06.502 --> 21:08.527
No, it wouldn't.

21:10.865 --> 21:13.652
I'm not going back to who I was.

21:13.868 --> 21:16.558
But what you said yesterday,
about a part of you

21:16.628 --> 21:20.089
always caring for me...
I feel the same way.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.388
Good-bye.

21:28.647 --> 21:30.382
Now go save Gotham.

21:36.824 --> 21:38.257
- (phone ringing)
- Ready at your command.

21:38.299 --> 21:39.580
Jim.

21:39.627 --> 21:41.392
- GORDON: <i>Harvey?</i>
- Thank God you're all right.

21:41.431 --> 21:43.289
- What the hell happened?
- <i>It's a long story.</i>

21:43.324 --> 21:45.956
<i>- Did Harlan get Bruce to the precinct?</i>
- Yeah. It's bad.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.567
<i>What? What are you talking about?</i>

21:47.622 --> 21:49.883
Jeremiah escaped. He's got Bruce.

21:49.930 --> 21:52.328
He took the bombs, all of them.

22:14.610 --> 22:16.248
BRUCE: It's true.

22:16.336 --> 22:19.140
- How did you two...
- Find each other?

22:20.351 --> 22:23.008
I like to think it was you, Bruce.

22:23.445 --> 22:26.504
You brought us together.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.480
I trust things went smoothly?

22:28.515 --> 22:30.248
Like clockwork.

22:32.590 --> 22:34.719
Did your men retrieve my bombs?

22:34.755 --> 22:38.954
They are en route to their
positions as we speak.

22:39.790 --> 22:41.595
From here,

22:42.390 --> 22:45.067
we can take in the full majesty

22:45.109 --> 22:47.304
of Gotham's destruction.

22:50.081 --> 22:52.214
You're both insane.

22:52.268 --> 22:53.672
I know

22:53.707 --> 22:55.924
it's difficult to fathom, Bruce,

22:56.409 --> 23:00.011
but Jeremiah and I
are doing this for your benefit.

23:00.047 --> 23:03.148
How is destroying Gotham
supposed to help me?

23:03.183 --> 23:04.616
Because I had a vision,

23:04.661 --> 23:07.963
that out of this crucible
of blood and fire

23:07.988 --> 23:10.622
will rise the dark knight
that your city needs.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.057
That I need.

23:13.035 --> 23:15.260
To be honest, Bruce,

23:15.793 --> 23:17.566
prophesies, visions...

23:17.645 --> 23:20.606
not really my cup of tea.

23:21.833 --> 23:24.701
But our friend revealed something to me:

23:25.599 --> 23:28.540
that my twin obsessions,
rebuilding Gotham

23:28.575 --> 23:32.010
and rebuilding you,
are one and the same.

23:32.045 --> 23:34.560
You're the brother I never had,

23:35.983 --> 23:38.662
the one Jerome never could be.

23:39.748 --> 23:42.787
We will create a legacy in this city.

23:42.910 --> 23:44.789
Gotham falls,

23:44.988 --> 23:47.058
we rise.

23:48.168 --> 23:49.995
Together.

23:55.379 --> 23:59.137
A dozen transport vans were
stolen from the GCPD motor pool.

23:59.172 --> 24:01.373
That's got to be how
they're carrying the bombs.

24:01.408 --> 24:04.342
There were sightings here,
here and here.

24:04.378 --> 24:06.077
They're moving towards
the outskirts of Gotham.

24:06.113 --> 24:08.079
Jeremiah must've changed targets.

24:08.115 --> 24:09.314
- Gordon.
- Perfect.

24:09.349 --> 24:10.982
You have some explaining to do.

24:11.018 --> 24:12.250
What happened to my men?

24:12.286 --> 24:13.718
Major, we got serious fish to fry.

24:13.754 --> 24:15.066
I didn't ask for your opinion,
Detective.

24:15.091 --> 24:16.187
Two more sightings.

24:16.223 --> 24:17.801
Bolyston and Third and then moving north

24:17.826 --> 24:19.934
- along the Van Hook Highway.
- What? That doesn't make any sense.

24:20.005 --> 24:22.227
What buildings would he
be targeting there?

24:22.262 --> 24:25.897
Told me Jeremiah promised to
turn Gotham into a dark island.

24:27.248 --> 24:29.138
We need to cancel the evacuation.

24:29.163 --> 24:31.569
- Get those people off the bridges.
- Absolutely not.

24:31.605 --> 24:33.171
They're filled with people
leaving the city.

24:33.206 --> 24:34.651
We'll bring them back into Gotham.

24:34.682 --> 24:36.932
- Buildings fall...
- The bridges are the targets.

24:36.987 --> 24:39.044
- Harper, spread the word.
- Don't move.

24:39.079 --> 24:40.987
Arrest Captain Gordon.

24:42.322 --> 24:44.375
I wouldn't do that.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.251
Arrest them both.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.177
Officer, your radio.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.632
This is Captain Gordon.

25:00.667 --> 25:03.201
I want all the bridges
cleared immediately.

25:03.236 --> 25:06.033
I repeat: clear all the bridges.

25:06.431 --> 25:10.108
Civilization is so fragile, Bruce.

25:10.478 --> 25:13.278
Gotham is soon to be each man
for himself,

25:13.313 --> 25:16.081
a more savage place.

25:16.116 --> 25:18.083
Sounds like fun.

25:18.773 --> 25:20.819
Sure you want to leave?

25:20.861 --> 25:22.661
Oh, hey, Bruce.

25:22.689 --> 25:23.822
Freak.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.658
RA'S AL GHUL: Hello, Barbara.

25:27.039 --> 25:28.737
I'm really glad you came.

25:29.313 --> 25:31.262
(sighs) Bad news, baby.

25:31.298 --> 25:32.564
I'm not leaving.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.466
Gotham's in my blood.

25:34.501 --> 25:38.737
And I don't think
I can let you leave, either.

25:39.806 --> 25:42.107
You reforged it. Well, now.

25:42.142 --> 25:44.943
You see, you say you're leaving,

25:44.978 --> 25:47.112
but I've got a feeling
you're gonna be back.

25:50.550 --> 25:53.199
And I don't like
looking over my shoulder.

25:53.238 --> 25:55.021
Need I remind you, Barbara,

25:55.099 --> 25:57.247
you've already tried using that knife.

25:57.591 --> 26:00.859
And also, you're outnumbered.

26:00.894 --> 26:05.163
Hmm. That Demon's Head's really
not working out for you, huh?

26:08.578 --> 26:10.470
(yelling)

26:13.473 --> 26:16.808
(siren wailing, horns honking)

26:16.843 --> 26:18.676
(urgent chatter)

26:19.591 --> 26:21.357
CHILD: Help! Help!

26:21.395 --> 26:22.714
Bullock, what the hell is going on?

26:22.749 --> 26:23.965
Why are we clearing the bridges?

26:23.997 --> 26:26.317
Because we said to do it.
Now just do it.

26:26.353 --> 26:28.720
Did a GCPD transport
van come through here?

26:28.755 --> 26:30.722
About 20 minutes ago.
Had to make way for it.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.111
What's your status?

26:32.136 --> 26:33.725
HARPER: <i>All the bridges
are being cleared.</i>

26:33.760 --> 26:35.026
But I just heard from our choppers

26:35.062 --> 26:37.028
and they spotted vans on every bridge.

26:39.099 --> 26:40.698
Vans are in position.

26:40.734 --> 26:42.500
Bombs could go off any minute.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.570
What the hell?

26:45.605 --> 26:47.072
BULLOCK: Jim!

26:47.107 --> 26:48.706
Out of the way!

26:52.212 --> 26:54.312
(grunts)

26:56.716 --> 26:58.249
When will you ever learn, Barbara?

26:58.285 --> 26:59.717
The knife has to be held by...

26:59.753 --> 27:01.352
Held by Bruce Wayne. I get it.

27:09.843 --> 27:11.996
So you know, this is for Selina.

27:13.033 --> 27:14.999
(grunts)

27:17.070 --> 27:21.539
In that case, it must be
very disappointing for you,

27:21.642 --> 27:24.157
dying like this.

27:24.244 --> 27:25.443
(gunshots)

27:33.220 --> 27:35.954
(grunting)

27:40.060 --> 27:41.893
What are you doing?

27:52.272 --> 27:54.572
Well done, Barbara.

27:54.608 --> 27:56.040
(explosions booming)

28:12.125 --> 28:13.725
(people screaming)

28:34.676 --> 28:36.981
The choice is now yours.

28:37.017 --> 28:41.742
Stay Bruce Wayne or accept your destiny.

28:42.016 --> 28:45.227
Become Gotham's dark knight.

28:58.038 --> 29:00.038
(alarm blaring, sirens wailing)

29:05.287 --> 29:08.123
(gunshots, sirens blaring outside)

29:12.337 --> 29:13.829
(sighs)

29:16.001 --> 29:18.554
NYGMA: Seems Jeremiah's
made good on his threat.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.758
And I take it that means
you're not leaving.

29:22.820 --> 29:24.695
How can I?

29:25.683 --> 29:27.884
They need me more than ever now.

29:27.919 --> 29:29.619
No one will help them but me.

29:32.490 --> 29:34.690
So what does that mean for us?

29:37.495 --> 29:40.803
Ed, this is the end of the road for us.

29:43.936 --> 29:46.991
All this time I've been
calling the other Ed stupid

29:47.055 --> 29:48.741
and I'm the idiot.

29:52.911 --> 29:55.304
You were never gonna leave with me.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.859
You just wanted to save Jim Gordon.

30:00.695 --> 30:03.453
You and Jim really
aren't that different.

30:03.796 --> 30:05.688
You both think you know me.

30:05.921 --> 30:08.357
You both want to change me.

30:08.892 --> 30:10.860
Neither one of you really sees me.

30:10.895 --> 30:14.228
(grunts)

30:15.200 --> 30:18.734
(groaning)

30:19.114 --> 30:21.037
For what it's worth, Ed,

30:21.162 --> 30:23.034
I was offering you something real.

30:23.107 --> 30:24.574
(pants)

30:25.417 --> 30:27.743
But I was never gonna be who you wanted.

30:28.537 --> 30:30.790
Sooner or later, you were
just gonna kill me.

30:30.815 --> 30:33.220
It's just what you do.

30:33.718 --> 30:35.017
That's quite possible.

30:35.053 --> 30:36.916
(grunts)

30:42.193 --> 30:44.738
But you're wrong, Lee.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.530
I do see you.

30:56.207 --> 30:58.508
(grunts)

30:58.543 --> 31:00.877
(both groaning)

31:18.229 --> 31:19.695
Calm.

31:19.731 --> 31:21.197
Where's Butch?

31:21.232 --> 31:22.998
What did you do with him?

31:24.591 --> 31:25.957
I'm right here.

31:38.059 --> 31:39.836
You're you.

31:40.002 --> 31:41.545
Yeah.

31:41.753 --> 31:42.919
I'm me again.

31:45.986 --> 31:48.224
- Yeah.
- I love you.

31:51.629 --> 31:54.430
I love you, too, baby.

32:00.038 --> 32:02.004
(chuckles)

32:04.042 --> 32:05.441
Oswald.

32:08.046 --> 32:10.346
I'll never forget this.

32:10.381 --> 32:13.349
Anything you need, I'm there.

32:13.384 --> 32:15.284
Thank you, Butch.

32:17.355 --> 32:21.023
I want you to know
I consider you a friend.

32:22.757 --> 32:25.361
And that I am truly sorry.

32:25.396 --> 32:26.829
What?

32:33.204 --> 32:35.605
(groans)

32:45.383 --> 32:48.484
Did you think I forgot
that you murdered my mother?

32:50.355 --> 32:53.333
That I just got over it?

32:54.778 --> 32:58.208
I have lived with that pain every day.

32:58.763 --> 33:01.964
I could have killed you
any time I wanted,

33:02.380 --> 33:05.101
but I believe in an eye for an eye.

33:05.964 --> 33:08.004
You took away the one person I love,

33:08.039 --> 33:10.628
so I took away the one person you love.

33:11.378 --> 33:13.902
And you get to live with that.

33:14.045 --> 33:16.145
(yells)

33:16.180 --> 33:18.147
(grunts)

33:23.567 --> 33:25.515
All of this...

33:26.125 --> 33:28.640
finding Strange, curing Butch,

33:29.093 --> 33:31.193
was all so you could kill him
in front of me?

33:33.078 --> 33:34.497
Exactly.

33:34.883 --> 33:36.761
But don't worry,

33:36.901 --> 33:38.734
in time, when I feel

33:38.770 --> 33:40.722
that you have suffered enough...

33:41.773 --> 33:44.073
I will kill you, too.

33:46.077 --> 33:48.177
Not if I kill you first.

33:50.615 --> 33:52.281
You're welcome to try.

33:52.984 --> 33:55.351
(grunts, groans)

33:57.553 --> 33:59.196
(Tabitha groans)

33:59.228 --> 34:01.228
I'll kill you!

34:03.327 --> 34:05.294
(indistinct shouting)

34:11.157 --> 34:12.962
BRUCE: Selina!

34:13.838 --> 34:15.304
How is she?

34:15.339 --> 34:16.605
She did well in surgery,

34:16.641 --> 34:18.793
but the bullet severed her spinal cord.

34:18.818 --> 34:20.943
And the damage is likely permanent.

34:22.409 --> 34:24.080
Mr. Wayne, the hospital
is shutting down.

34:24.114 --> 34:25.481
This is the last ambulance

34:25.516 --> 34:26.521
leaving for the boats.

34:26.552 --> 34:28.751
We have room for you, but we need to go.

34:31.889 --> 34:33.856
(indistinct chatter)

34:33.891 --> 34:35.858
(helicopter blades whirring)

34:37.628 --> 34:39.395
(distant explosion)

34:40.831 --> 34:43.032
(sirens wailing)

34:43.752 --> 34:45.447
Bruce.

34:47.952 --> 34:49.938
I can't leave, Alfred.

34:51.641 --> 34:52.942
Ra's was right.

34:53.538 --> 34:55.978
This is what I'm meant to do.

34:56.663 --> 34:58.748
The city's abandoned, Master Bruce.

34:58.783 --> 35:00.174
There's nothing more you can do here, mate.

35:00.198 --> 35:01.580
Jeremiah's still out there.

35:01.607 --> 35:04.018
He is not your responsibility.

35:05.494 --> 35:08.591
Gotham is not your responsibility.

35:12.029 --> 35:13.963
I'm making it mine.

35:17.793 --> 35:19.247
Um...

35:20.530 --> 35:21.997
Oh, sod it.

35:23.832 --> 35:26.075
All right, fine.

35:26.210 --> 35:28.299
- We'll both stay.
- No.

35:31.015 --> 35:33.949
I need to know Selina's gonna be okay.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.323
Please.

35:42.927 --> 35:44.860
All right, I'll see that she's safe...

35:46.697 --> 35:49.799
...and then I'll come back
and I will find you.

35:52.185 --> 35:53.790
I promise.

36:06.884 --> 36:08.851
(engine starts)

36:12.924 --> 36:14.890
(ambulance pulls away)

36:14.926 --> 36:16.892
♪ ♪

36:27.875 --> 36:29.224
BULLOCK: You just can't
throw in the towel

36:29.249 --> 36:30.365
on an entire city.

36:30.406 --> 36:32.781
There's no way to know how many
bombs are still out there.

36:32.835 --> 36:34.989
The power's out, water supply's damaged.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.695
You're giving up, plain and simple.

36:36.723 --> 36:38.656
We're proceeding with the evacuation.

36:38.692 --> 36:40.191
Boats will run all night.

36:40.545 --> 36:43.772
Everyone leaves, including the police.

36:43.803 --> 36:45.230
Now, the governor's
declared the city off-limits

36:45.265 --> 36:46.808
until the situation can be evaluated.

36:46.833 --> 36:49.234
Well, I'm not leaving,
so if you're gonna arrest me,

36:49.269 --> 36:50.834
do it now.

36:52.539 --> 36:54.505
(clears throat)

36:57.277 --> 36:58.776
He's right, Jim.

36:58.812 --> 37:00.211
The government's given
up on the place...

37:00.262 --> 37:01.435
there's gonna be nobody here.

37:01.482 --> 37:03.047
The gangs are carving up turf.

37:03.083 --> 37:05.216
In two hours, this city's
gonna be a battleground.

37:12.692 --> 37:15.393
Hey! What are you guys doing here?

37:15.428 --> 37:18.229
(gunshots)

37:19.799 --> 37:21.569
Yes.

37:21.928 --> 37:24.162
This will do nicely.

37:24.304 --> 37:27.295
This is our territory. You can't...

37:27.407 --> 37:29.607
(machine whirring)

37:33.647 --> 37:35.816
Now it's mine.

37:38.084 --> 37:41.353
I want a ring of fire ten blocks wide.

37:41.682 --> 37:46.283
If anyone stands in your way, burn them!

37:57.003 --> 37:58.661
The hell...

37:59.654 --> 38:02.855
No... not hell.

38:02.910 --> 38:05.278
(crying out)

38:15.655 --> 38:18.933
Hell is what's coming.

38:19.959 --> 38:22.308
Penguin says fix 'em.

38:37.344 --> 38:41.279
What should I do with you?

38:44.200 --> 38:46.091
Ra's al Ghul is gone.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.318
You defeated him.

38:49.349 --> 38:53.654
We have spoken and agree...
we will follow you.

38:58.565 --> 39:01.486
Wow. I am honored.

39:02.202 --> 39:03.968
(groaning)

39:05.707 --> 39:07.189
Tabitha?

39:07.275 --> 39:09.557
- What happened?
- Penguin.

39:09.809 --> 39:12.041
He shot me and killed Butch.

39:16.951 --> 39:20.350
Everything that is wrong with Gotham...

39:20.653 --> 39:23.944
all the greed, the pain,

39:24.057 --> 39:26.321
the corruption, the destruction...

39:26.393 --> 39:30.321
it can all be traced
back to one problem...

39:30.397 --> 39:32.305
men!

39:33.233 --> 39:37.481
Well, I think it is time
what we had a men-free zone,

39:37.598 --> 39:39.403
starting here.

39:40.907 --> 39:42.874
(stabbing, slashing, pained cries)

39:48.281 --> 39:50.248
♪ ♪

40:02.095 --> 40:03.761
(electricity switches clank on
in succession)

40:03.797 --> 40:05.029
LUCIUS: That's better.

40:05.064 --> 40:06.998
That's much better.

40:07.033 --> 40:08.833
Lucius?

40:09.860 --> 40:12.336
I'd requisitioned one
of Jeremiah's battery bombs

40:12.386 --> 40:13.922
before it went to the warehouse.

40:13.961 --> 40:16.340
Just restored it
to its original purpose.

40:16.376 --> 40:18.209
It is an ingenious mechanism.

40:18.962 --> 40:20.778
BULLOCK: I told him we were staying.

40:20.814 --> 40:22.595
Figured we could use some help with

40:22.629 --> 40:25.048
the, uh, science stuff.

40:25.718 --> 40:27.452
And there are others on their way.

40:27.487 --> 40:28.719
This is our city.

40:28.755 --> 40:30.254
You're going to need our help.

40:31.058 --> 40:32.831
Speaking of,

40:33.282 --> 40:35.636
there's something I need you to do.

40:36.029 --> 40:37.795
(grunting)

40:48.050 --> 40:50.792
- Where's Jeremiah?
- I don't know!

40:51.144 --> 40:54.545
If you see him, you tell him
I'm looking for him.

41:17.707 --> 41:19.340
Bruce...

41:21.508 --> 41:23.402
You're not supposed to be here.

41:23.476 --> 41:27.340
Neither are you, or the
dozen cops downstairs.

41:28.181 --> 41:29.814
But you stayed to fight for the city.

41:34.161 --> 41:36.345
The gangs are carving up territory.

41:36.436 --> 41:38.269
We're gonna have to go block by block.

41:39.041 --> 41:41.627
I have no idea what we're gonna find.

41:42.134 --> 41:43.861
A thing like this brings out

41:43.897 --> 41:45.994
whatever's lurking in the shadows.

41:46.065 --> 41:48.032
(distant gunfire)

41:58.912 --> 42:00.878
(chittering)

42:04.350 --> 42:05.716
(shrieking)

42:05.752 --> 42:07.718
(chopping)

42:28.261 --> 42:30.004
The light.

42:31.010 --> 42:32.877
You're basically daring
whatever's out there

42:32.912 --> 42:34.322
to come after you.

42:35.248 --> 42:37.166
Let them come.

42:38.558 --> 42:41.272
There are still good people out there.

42:42.956 --> 42:44.976
They need to know we're here...

42:46.218 --> 42:48.280
willing to fight.

42:51.698 --> 42:53.998
I remember the night we met.

42:57.996 --> 43:01.077
You told me the world may seem dark...

43:02.709 --> 43:04.542
But there is light.
