00:02.002 --> 00:03.351
I mean, I can't believe
I'm on the road
opening for Margaret Cho.

00:03.394 --> 00:04.917
It's like
a dream come true.

00:06.832 --> 00:08.791
Joaquin's mother:
We need to talk
about your sister, Jenna.

00:08.834 --> 00:11.924
She sent me a postcard
from someplace
called The Coterie.

00:11.968 --> 00:14.362
Joaquin: This whole time,
I thought no one's heard
from her in eight years.

00:14.405 --> 00:16.059
I think you're more upset
about your sister leaving

00:16.103 --> 00:17.191
than you're letting on.

00:17.234 --> 00:18.714
You should
call your sister back.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.498
Mariana:
How did you know
that my sister called?

00:22.544 --> 00:23.936
Don't want to grow apart.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.938
-I missed you.
-I missed you too.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.940
And how's things
with Angelica?

00:28.550 --> 00:29.986
Malika:
I'm falling for you.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.422
Matt dumped me.

00:31.466 --> 00:32.902
I needed to tell someone,

00:32.945 --> 00:35.078
but please don't tell Dennis.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.733
It was really hard
to get over you the first time.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.387
Sumi:
I'm still in love with you.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.780
I just think maybe
we're better off as friends.

00:43.130 --> 00:46.089
I'm sorry I had to bail
on the doctor.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.786
Isabella: It's okay.
Dennis went with me.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.006
You're the one who wanted
to be part of this pregnancy,

00:50.050 --> 00:51.921
and you're never even here!

00:51.964 --> 00:55.185
If it wasn't for Dennis,
I would feel totally alone.

00:55.751 --> 00:56.839
Why don't we get our own place?

00:56.882 --> 00:58.841
So'd we live together?

00:58.884 --> 01:00.060
Can we think about it?

01:01.496 --> 01:03.019
I thought
I might find you up here.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.369
Hey, Dennis.

01:05.413 --> 01:07.328
You-- you got a boy.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.372
Congratulations.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.113
Congratulations to you too.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.073

-Yes, I'm aware.

We should throw him
a Coterie party.

Dennis isn't really
into celebrating his birthday.

that's a great idea!

Okay, so I was thinking
it would be '90s theme

02:02.513 --> 02:03.862
since that's when he was
in high school.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.516
And there should
definitely be karaoke.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.475
Oh, and it should
definitely be a surprise.

02:07.518 --> 02:10.173
Okay, look, I think
I know Dennis better
than anyone,

What, is she supposed
to be a Playboy bunny?

03:05.707 --> 03:07.230
Were they even from the '90s?

03:07.274 --> 03:09.624
She's a fem-bot from
"Austin Powers."

03:09.667 --> 03:11.930
Fem-bot. Makes sense.
And you?

Aw, I used to love Brad Pitt

03:17.588 --> 03:19.286
until he cheated
on Jennifer Aniston.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.766
Oh. And, uh, you are?

03:22.637 --> 03:23.725
Ginger Spice?

-What?

03:33.691 --> 03:36.868
I just-- I didn't realize
you had a sense of humor.

03:36.912 --> 03:37.695
Oh.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.698
I didn't realize that you used
to work for Evan Speck.

03:40.742 --> 03:43.135
Was that him I saw
leaving your loft
the other morning?

03:48.184 --> 03:49.316
Hello.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.752
Hey.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.710
-Hi.
-Hmm.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.325
-Who's that?
-Evan Speck.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.762
-Mariana used to work
under him.
-Hmm.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.285
Sometimes on top of him.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.156
You know, former boss,

04:04.200 --> 04:06.507
former,
but maybe still, lover.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.729
What are you,
the hall monitor?

04:12.556 --> 04:13.514
I need a refill.

Love it.

04:24.699 --> 04:25.700
But who are you?

04:25.743 --> 04:27.310
Be careful with those!

04:27.354 --> 04:28.833
I'm Shelby Woo

04:28.877 --> 04:30.618
from "The Mystery Files
of Shelby Woo."

04:33.142 --> 04:35.753
Asian characters
were very underrepresented
in the '90s.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.146
Mm. Still are.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.713
So what's this I hear
about the two of you?

04:38.756 --> 04:40.454
Oh! Yeah!

04:41.498 --> 04:42.325
It's all true.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.329
[indistinct chatter]

04:46.373 --> 04:48.288
Oh, my God!
Alice, you're back!

04:48.331 --> 04:49.898
Uh, early!

04:50.377 --> 04:52.770
Yep! Uh, Margaret
had to cancel her tour

04:52.814 --> 04:53.989
'cause she booked a movie.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.164
You know, showbiz.

04:55.207 --> 04:56.818
Oh, well,
welcome home.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.863
Um, I'll move
out of your loft
right away.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.258
Don't worry about it.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.956
I mean, you can stay
for as long as you want
actually,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.132
because, um,
I'm moving in with Sumi.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.048
-Oh!
-We're back together.

05:11.659 --> 05:15.358
So, Sumice. Ugh.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.446
Alumi?

05:16.968 --> 05:18.666
Nope.
Not digging your ship names.

05:18.709 --> 05:21.321
Not to mention,
Sumi cheated on you
the last time

05:21.364 --> 05:22.452
and broke your heart.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.456
But though I've never seen
any evidence of this,

05:26.500 --> 05:27.805
I guess people can change.

05:29.024 --> 05:29.981
Mazel!

05:31.026 --> 05:31.853
-Get in.
-No. No, no, no.

05:31.896 --> 05:34.029
[indistinct chatter]

05:37.032 --> 05:39.339
Both paramours in one night.
How'd that happen?

05:42.864 --> 05:45.997
Mmm, how about Thursday night?

05:46.041 --> 05:47.825
Mmm, probably working late.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.697
-Again?
-Yeah.

05:49.740 --> 05:50.959
Is this the new normal?

05:52.526 --> 05:54.354
Lucia's got lots of notes
on my women's center proposal,

05:54.397 --> 05:56.530
and it's important
I get it right before
we take it to the floor.

05:56.965 --> 05:57.879
But how about Friday?

05:59.359 --> 06:00.403
I'm working.

06:01.099 --> 06:02.057
How about Saturday night?

06:03.450 --> 06:05.060
Ooh, um...

06:07.192 --> 06:09.194
I have plans with Dyonte.

06:10.761 --> 06:14.199
But... it's actually
a surprise party for Dennis.

06:14.243 --> 06:15.810
So why don't you come too?

06:16.376 --> 06:17.464
Won't Dyonte mind?

06:17.507 --> 06:20.075
I don't think so.
I'll invite Tanya.

06:20.118 --> 06:20.989
Who's Tanya?

06:21.685 --> 06:23.208
She's Dyonte's primary partner.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.514
What's a primary partner
mean?

06:24.558 --> 06:26.821
She's like, you know,
his closest relationship.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.345
The person
he's most committed to,
usually long-term.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.739
Sort of like his priority.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.394
And you don't mind
not being his priority?

06:34.872 --> 06:38.659
No. We're still new.
And it's less pressure.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.705
Well, if Dyonte doesn't mind,
I'll come.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.055
Great!

06:44.839 --> 06:47.972
So, um, are you in a rush
to get to work?

06:48.712 --> 06:49.887
I got a little time.

06:50.497 --> 06:51.323
Mm-hmm?

06:54.675 --> 06:55.893
Malika:
Busy schedules.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.808
Only way
to see them both
this weekend.

06:59.331 --> 07:00.811
Davia: Well,
it's good they get along.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.857
Angelica makes
a hot Britney.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.162
Girl, she makes
everything hot.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.165
Okay, I see you blushing!

07:07.949 --> 07:09.211
Are things getting serious?

07:10.342 --> 07:11.256
Maybe.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.084
I'll be right back.

07:14.346 --> 07:16.000
Look, I'm just sayin',
the princess of R&B

07:16.044 --> 07:18.612
and rap's
Hollywood crossover king
are a hard pair to beat.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.353
But Janet and Britney
are straight fire.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.965
I mean,
I can get jiggy with it

07:24.008 --> 07:25.662
and I can hit it
one more time.

07:25.706 --> 07:26.489
Oh!

07:29.013 --> 07:30.058
Is Tanya coming?

07:31.407 --> 07:33.714
What? What happened?

07:34.541 --> 07:36.630
Didn't wanna bring it up tonight
but Tanya and I split up.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.894
Dennis is coming! He's here.

07:39.937 --> 07:42.070
-Everyone hide!
-Oh, where do we go?

07:42.113 --> 07:43.680
Let's go! Let's go!

07:47.031 --> 07:48.424
Alice:
Run, Forrest, run!

07:58.303 --> 08:00.088
[whispers indistinctly]

08:00.654 --> 08:02.786
Dennis,
I'm not ordering
for you.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.179
Big boys
speak for themselves.

08:04.222 --> 08:05.528
If you want something to eat,

08:05.572 --> 08:08.096
just go to the window
and order for yourself.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.230
I'm too scared.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.494
Hey, man.

08:15.712 --> 08:18.149
Just had a hunch,
but do you like pizza?

08:19.890 --> 08:22.719
How would you like
to try my pizza toast?

08:23.851 --> 08:25.026
Answer him.

08:27.463 --> 08:28.290
Okay.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.248
Excellent choice.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.163
And I will have
your seasonal avocado toast.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.601
Thank you.

You're welcome.

You're going to love it.
Tastes so good.

08:43.348 --> 08:44.611
Isabella:
What was that about?

08:45.394 --> 08:48.136
Oh, just a kid struggling
to find his words.

08:48.179 --> 08:50.094
I was like that at his age.

08:50.138 --> 08:52.009
You? At a loss for words?

08:52.662 --> 08:55.447
I used to struggle
with social anxiety.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.668
Well, looks like
you got over that.

22:34.962 --> 22:37.051
Well, we can build
a fence around the pool.

22:37.094 --> 22:38.705
And child gates.

22:38.748 --> 22:41.316
Oh, and you can have my loft
if you want to live downstairs.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.014
Dennis: Also, for
the first nine months

22:44.058 --> 22:45.233
before the baby is walking,

22:45.276 --> 22:47.191
you don't have
to worry about all that.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.845
I can say from experience

22:48.889 --> 22:52.806
that having as many extra hands
around a newborn is a lifesaver.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.330
Plus the more love,
the better.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.680
Hmm. That's a great point.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.727
Actually, I mean,
there's no rush. Right?

23:00.770 --> 23:02.424
And I kind of
love the idea

23:02.468 --> 23:04.644
of lots of aunties
and uncles being around.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.560
Maybe we wait till the baby
gets a little older?

23:08.474 --> 23:09.953
Yeah.

23:09.997 --> 23:12.913
Well, as a future auntie,

23:12.956 --> 23:14.654
I'd like to make a toast
to the birthday boy.

23:14.697 --> 23:15.829
Malika:
Okay!

23:15.872 --> 23:17.483
Alice:
You're a wonderful friend,

23:17.526 --> 23:20.094
a skilled chef
with family dinners.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.575
-Yes! We appreciate that.
-We love you.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.664
-To Dennis.
-all: To Dennis!

23:24.707 --> 23:26.622
Thank you. Thank you.

23:27.275 --> 23:29.451
Hmm. If we're toasting,

23:29.495 --> 23:33.803
uh, you just got this bottle
of champagne today.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.762
I didn't have a chance
to read the card yet.

23:35.805 --> 23:38.634
So... can I do that now,
please?

23:38.678 --> 23:40.767
Sure, weirdo, go ahead.
Read my card.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.246
Yup. Okay.

23:42.290 --> 23:43.465
[clears throat]

23:43.509 --> 23:46.381
"Happy 40th birthday, Dennis."
That's you.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.557
"And congratulations
on your new baby.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.779
With love, Jennifer."

23:57.261 --> 23:58.480
Are you pregnant?

23:59.350 --> 24:02.092
Hmm? No. No.

24:04.355 --> 24:09.752
Um... Isabella and I
ran into my ex-wife,

24:09.796 --> 24:11.928
her husband, and, uh, new baby

24:11.972 --> 24:14.322
when we were at the hospital
the other day.

24:14.365 --> 24:18.239
Why is she congratulating you
on a new baby?

24:21.547 --> 24:24.637
Um... We were just
looking at babies
in the maternity ward,

24:24.680 --> 24:26.552
and she saw
that I was pregnant,

24:26.595 --> 24:30.469
and so she just assumed
that Dennis was the father.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.211
No. I mean,
I think it's a...

24:35.082 --> 24:37.563
It's a fair assumption
since, uh,

24:37.606 --> 24:40.957
Dennis is taking you
to doctors' appointments

24:41.001 --> 24:43.656
and deciding where
we should have the baby

24:43.699 --> 24:44.526
and where we should live.
You know what?

24:44.570 --> 24:46.354
In fact, why don't you guys

24:46.397 --> 24:48.356
just tell me
when the baby's coming

24:48.399 --> 24:49.836
and where I should show up?

24:50.880 --> 24:52.316
Gael.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.535
Excuse me.

24:53.579 --> 24:54.623
Gael?

24:59.933 --> 25:02.544
Gael! Hey, what
is going on with you?

25:02.588 --> 25:03.980
What is going on with you?

25:04.459 --> 25:05.895
Are you having the baby
with me or Dennis?

25:05.939 --> 25:07.506
Because you seem
way more interested

25:07.549 --> 25:08.637
in everything
that he has to say.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.771
Dennis is our friend,
and he's done this before.

25:11.814 --> 25:14.513
So, yes, his advice
means something to me.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.471
You wish that Dennis
was the father of the baby?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.864
-What?
-Because why?

25:19.692 --> 25:21.389
Why are you guys
looking at babies together
at the maternity ward?

25:21.432 --> 25:23.565
Why didn't you correct his ex

25:23.609 --> 25:25.611
when she just assumed
that he was the father?

25:27.351 --> 25:29.702
I should have. I'm sorry.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.573
It was just-- It was--

25:31.617 --> 25:33.009
It was
a very awkward moment,

25:33.053 --> 25:35.359
and I couldn't imagine
the pain he must have felt,

25:35.403 --> 25:37.318
seeing his wife
with a new baby boy.

25:39.625 --> 25:43.585
Gael, I am very, very clear
on who the father is

25:43.629 --> 25:45.631
and who I want to do this with.

25:47.589 --> 25:48.895
But I'm scared.

25:48.938 --> 25:52.072
What if I make a mistake
or I'm a terrible mom?

25:53.073 --> 25:54.640
You won't be.

25:56.772 --> 25:59.645
Isabella, I'm...
I'm sorry.

26:00.907 --> 26:03.431
I've just been feeling
a little insecure

26:03.474 --> 26:06.260
because we're not a couple.

26:09.002 --> 26:12.440
What happens when you find
someone and you fall in love,

26:12.483 --> 26:14.573
and then there's another man
in the baby's life?

26:15.443 --> 26:18.620
What happens
when you meet someone
and you fall in love

26:18.664 --> 26:21.188
and our daughter
has a really cool step-mom?

26:23.320 --> 26:25.714
Step-moms are all evil.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.803
You gotta brush up
on your bedtime stories.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.073
Okay. Um...

26:38.684 --> 26:40.294
Let's just make a promise

26:41.556 --> 26:43.558
that no matter
who comes in our lives,

26:43.602 --> 26:45.473
we will always
put each other first

26:45.516 --> 26:47.606
as the parents
of our child.

26:50.957 --> 26:51.958
Deal.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.410
So...

27:10.367 --> 27:11.673
does this mean
the party's over?

27:12.587 --> 27:14.023
Doubt it.

27:14.067 --> 27:17.113
There's usually a blowup,
but we always get past it.

27:17.157 --> 27:18.201
Hmm.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.249
[sighs] Sorry.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.554
Oh, no, it's okay.

27:23.598 --> 27:26.601
Trust me, I'm used
to my fair share of drama.

27:27.602 --> 27:28.908
It's not that.

27:29.952 --> 27:32.563
Everyone here
is like family to me.

27:32.607 --> 27:33.652
It's just...

27:34.609 --> 27:36.002
They're not your sister.

27:37.743 --> 27:41.747
It's my first Coterie party
without her.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.663
I didn't think
it would hit me this hard.

27:46.403 --> 27:47.753
Why don't you just call her?

27:49.319 --> 27:50.843
Man, I would...

27:52.192 --> 27:54.411
I would give anything
to talk to my sister again.

27:55.674 --> 27:56.631
What do you mean?

27:58.851 --> 27:59.765
She's, uh...

28:01.157 --> 28:03.682
She's not in Oklahoma
with her husband and kids.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.511
She left home
eight years ago.

28:07.555 --> 28:09.383
And I have...

28:10.123 --> 28:13.343
I have no idea where she's at
or how to get in touch with her.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.264
I've just learned
that there's some things

28:21.308 --> 28:22.918
you shouldn't take for granted.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.668
Sorry Gael ruined the party.

28:34.887 --> 28:36.149
That was intense.

28:38.368 --> 28:41.067
Isabella and I have spent
a lot of time together.

28:41.110 --> 28:43.156
I might have overstepped.

28:44.897 --> 28:46.550
Well, if anyone
was overstepping,

28:46.594 --> 28:48.074
I'd bet my money
on Isabella.

28:48.727 --> 28:49.989
Why do you say that?

28:50.032 --> 28:52.556
She just tends to get
between people is all.

28:53.819 --> 28:54.733
Like who?

28:55.995 --> 28:57.518
Raj and Mariana.

29:02.653 --> 29:03.872
You and me.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.793
I planned this entire party
with Isabella,

29:11.837 --> 29:13.752
and I fought her
every bit of the way.

29:14.970 --> 29:17.103
I was so sure that
you'd hate to be surprised.

29:17.146 --> 29:18.408
And karaoke?

29:20.454 --> 29:23.674
I... I guess
I don't know you anymore.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.720
-She's your person now.
-Come on.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.771
Well, I do have
a confession.

29:35.034 --> 29:38.428
I hate surprises
and I do not like karaoke.

29:39.168 --> 29:40.996
I have struggled
through this evening,

29:41.040 --> 29:44.739
and other than,
well, the lot of you
and your kindness,

29:44.783 --> 29:47.002
I find being
the center of attention

29:47.046 --> 29:48.787
truly exhausting.

29:50.179 --> 29:51.267
Really?

29:51.877 --> 29:53.313
I mean,
I'm sorry you're miserable.

29:53.356 --> 29:54.314
Are you?

29:54.357 --> 29:55.750
[both chuckle]

29:58.753 --> 30:00.059
Okay. Well, I have
a confession too.

30:01.887 --> 30:02.975
Matt and I are...

30:06.108 --> 30:07.240
He dumped me.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.417
Mm, what?

30:10.896 --> 30:13.550
Well, I waited too long
to make up my mind, I guess.

30:14.900 --> 30:17.772
He wanted someone
who didn't take weeks

30:17.816 --> 30:19.774
to figure out
that they wanted him.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.908
I'm so sorry to hear that.

30:22.951 --> 30:23.778
Are you?

30:25.824 --> 30:27.695
Just to clear something up
about being wanted.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.828
I... I did want you.

30:31.917 --> 30:34.615
It wasn't just need.

30:40.273 --> 30:41.752
And I need to learn
how to be happy

30:41.796 --> 30:43.798
before I can make
somebody else happy,

30:43.842 --> 30:46.235
which is why I'm trying
to enjoy tonight

30:46.279 --> 30:48.324
despite the karaoke.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.545
Fake it
till you make it, right?

30:52.720 --> 30:53.764
Yeah.

30:54.504 --> 30:55.766
Old and wise.

30:58.073 --> 31:00.119
And I'm still
a work in progress, but...

31:02.077 --> 31:04.819
I'm grateful that
I'm not turning 40

31:04.863 --> 31:06.342
as the man I was.

31:08.649 --> 31:12.958
I'm glad to be turning 40
as the man that I am here today.

31:14.481 --> 31:16.831
In The Coterie,
with all of you.

31:21.140 --> 31:22.837
Despite the occasional blow-up.

31:36.895 --> 31:37.852
Happy birthday.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.161
Thank you.

31:49.298 --> 31:51.822
Well, whistle
if you need any help.

31:56.784 --> 31:57.785
I'm so sorry.

31:59.395 --> 32:01.615
I wasn't even thinking about
how it must have been for you

32:01.658 --> 32:04.487
to run into Jennifer
with their baby.

32:06.141 --> 32:08.535
-It's okay.
-No, no, it's not.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.754
I mean, I was being
insecure and petty.

32:10.798 --> 32:11.973
I'm sorry
if I overstepped.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.932
I just want to be
supportive of you both,

32:13.975 --> 32:14.976
but mainly you.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.414
You're my best friend.

32:19.415 --> 32:21.243
And I'll always
be here for you, buddy.

32:26.118 --> 32:29.121
Davia:
Paging the birthday boy
to the karaoke stage.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.819
-Okay, well...
-That's you.

32:31.862 --> 32:33.734
Davia:
Come on, it would not be a party

32:33.777 --> 32:35.475
without
a Dennis and Davia duet.

32:35.518 --> 32:36.911
-Yes!
-Make me beg.
