00:45.467 --> 00:47.027
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

00:47.067 --> 00:48.297
Thank you.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.830
Language practice only, Doctor.

01:13.867 --> 01:17.527
An educated woman like you
obsessed with soap opera?

01:17.567 --> 01:20.727
She's cheating on him, right?
With the little brother.

01:20.767 --> 01:24.027
Wait. Or are they cheating
on each other?

01:24.067 --> 01:26.727
Do your homework,
you'll find out.

01:26.767 --> 01:29.097
Doctor, help!

01:30.833 --> 01:31.903
Hello?

01:31.933 --> 01:35.203
I was taking her to the airport
when she passed out.

01:35.233 --> 01:37.433
Can you hear me?
What's your name?

01:43.200 --> 01:45.330
Has anybody actually
seen Dr Walker?

01:45.367 --> 01:46.427
No.

01:46.467 --> 01:48.597
Well, I can't wait forever.
We're busy today.

01:48.633 --> 01:51.773
Let's start in OPD.
Dr Nair's surgical clinic...

01:51.800 --> 01:54.130
- Is cancelled.
- Impossible.

01:54.167 --> 01:56.627
I sent you a memo last week.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.827
AJ and I have
a wedding to attend.

01:58.867 --> 02:02.767
I assumed you'd just decided
to smarten up,

02:02.800 --> 02:05.370
simultaneously, but I knew
nothing about a wedding.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.270
Wait a minute.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.470
I guessed as much.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.600
Here we are.

02:11.633 --> 02:15.433
And before you ask, Varun
is my closest and oldest friend,

02:15.467 --> 02:17.697
so there's absolutely positively
no negotiation.

02:17.733 --> 02:19.803
Fine, I'll just have to cope.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.433
- Finally.
- Sorry.

02:21.467 --> 02:25.127
They just brought someone in -
English tourist, female.

02:25.167 --> 02:28.167
She's fine. I've sent her for an
ECG. She's complaining already.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.330
After she threw up on me.

02:30.367 --> 02:33.597
Then the pleasure of treating
your countrywoman is all yours.

02:33.633 --> 02:36.433
Dr Varma, thank you for deciding
not to abandon me,

02:36.467 --> 02:38.027
but the reward for your loyalty

02:38.067 --> 02:39.827
will be to cover
surgical outpatients,

02:39.867 --> 02:42.427
- alone.
- My pleasure.

02:42.467 --> 02:46.397
- And what will you be doing?
- Good question.

02:46.433 --> 02:50.433
Supervision, which is something
you all desperately need.

02:50.467 --> 02:54.067
I'm sorry, she wants
to see you again, Doctor.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.800
It seems my own advice
is insufficient.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.333
Sure. I won't be a second.

02:58.367 --> 03:00.527
Go. Go. Go.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.470
Come on.

03:05.267 --> 03:08.067
Also, the water's still not
working, in my cottage.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.200
I told them to see to it.
Are you sure?

03:10.233 --> 03:12.373
I showered in perfume again.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.770
Is that really perfume?
I thought it was vomit.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.300
Only it's been a week now.

03:16.333 --> 03:17.673
Fine, I'll discuss it with them.

03:17.700 --> 03:20.170
Although, to be honest,
it's like herding cats

03:20.200 --> 03:21.770
with attention deficit disorder.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.470
It seems like
a basic requirement.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.230
Fine. Complaint noted.
I'll see to it.

03:25.267 --> 03:27.227
You'll be expecting wages next.

03:27.267 --> 03:29.727
- Doctor.
- No, not in here!

03:29.767 --> 03:32.227
How many times?
This is a hospital!

04:08.533 --> 04:11.273
Your ECG is fine,
which is a good start.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.300
This heat
can take you by surprise.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.103
Maybe.

04:15.133 --> 04:17.333
It's more likely
to be the bloody food.

04:17.367 --> 04:19.327
I've been warned enough times.

04:19.367 --> 04:22.667
No salad, no ice.
I just don't understand

04:22.700 --> 04:26.070
why they can't follow
a bit of basic food hygiene.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.100
You're here on holiday?

04:28.133 --> 04:31.703
For my sins, yeah. Never
believe the brochure, Dr...?

04:31.733 --> 04:33.633
Walker. Ruby.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.567
Thank God you're English.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.170
Nottingham born and trained.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.530
I am sorry about...

04:39.567 --> 04:42.827
What on earth
are you doing here?

04:42.867 --> 04:45.367
Let's just say it seemed
like a good idea at the time.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.430
At least you understand
what I'm going through.

04:47.467 --> 04:49.067
Doctor, quick as you can,
please.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.000
Just give me a minute, OK?

04:55.100 --> 04:57.230
Suspected vehicle collision.
Hit and run.

04:57.267 --> 04:59.297
- They didn't deign to stop.
- Is that allowed?

04:59.333 --> 05:02.533
Of course not. Even in India
there are some rules, Doctor.

05:02.567 --> 05:06.127
Whether people choose to abide
by them is their business.

05:07.067 --> 05:08.567
Mr Davé?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.730
I'm Dr Walker.

05:18.367 --> 05:19.667
Does it hurt when I press here?

05:20.467 --> 05:21.627
No.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.500
And here?

05:25.700 --> 05:28.800
No. It's fine.

05:28.833 --> 05:31.273
Chest sounds clear, belly's
soft, no sign of a head injury.

05:31.300 --> 05:33.500
You're a very lucky man,
Mr Davé.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.473
Er, Doctor...

05:45.867 --> 05:48.497
- Look. Look at the size of it.
- What?

05:48.533 --> 05:51.033
That is the size
of a bloody blackbird.

05:51.067 --> 05:52.367
Do you think it's poisonous?

05:52.400 --> 05:54.370
What am I saying?
We're in India.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.670
Of course it's bloody poisonous.

05:56.700 --> 05:57.830
I'm going to kill it.

05:57.867 --> 06:00.467
Don't. Just shoo it
out the door.

06:01.533 --> 06:03.403
Damn!!

06:04.867 --> 06:06.697
Look what you've made me do.

06:06.733 --> 06:08.573
- Let's have a look.
- It's fine.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.570
That's deep.
It might need stitches.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.700
- It's nothing.
- You need to get it looked at.

06:12.733 --> 06:14.403
It could get infected
in this heat,

06:14.433 --> 06:16.233
especially
if you're not strong.

06:16.267 --> 06:19.067
- I'm fine.
- You need to get it looked at.

06:19.100 --> 06:21.170
I'm not going anywhere.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.300
If you're not prepared
to listen to a word I say,

06:25.333 --> 06:29.273
you can bloody well get out
of my... Go on, bugger off.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.330
Out.

06:44.267 --> 06:46.827
Fracture, dislocation,
open wound.

06:46.867 --> 06:49.797
Skin is looking ischaemic.
Needs reducing right away.

06:49.833 --> 06:51.003
So what are you waiting for?

06:51.033 --> 06:53.533
Or are you hoping it'll drop off
and save us all a job?

06:53.567 --> 06:55.027
You don't want to take over?

06:55.067 --> 06:56.727
Basic orthopaedic surgery.

06:56.767 --> 06:58.267
I believe the Chinese
are already

06:58.300 --> 07:00.370
training monkeys to do it.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.370
OK.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.670
We need 500mg of morphine
and 500mg of Midazolam.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.433
Lord Ganesh.

07:24.833 --> 07:26.333
I see you.

07:26.367 --> 07:28.627
Bless you, sir.

07:28.667 --> 07:29.897
Do you think he's ready?

07:29.933 --> 07:32.833
Give him any more, we'll have
to peel him off the ceiling.

07:32.867 --> 07:35.267
Ready?

07:35.300 --> 07:37.200
OK, on three.

07:37.233 --> 07:39.333
One, two,

07:40.333 --> 07:43.173
three.

07:51.700 --> 07:52.800
Thank you...

07:52.833 --> 07:54.803
very...

07:54.833 --> 07:56.473
much,

07:57.100 --> 07:58.400
Doctor.

08:04.867 --> 08:07.297
- Excuse me, Nurse?
- You shouldn't be here.

08:07.333 --> 08:10.373
If you're looking for
Admissions, you need...

08:10.400 --> 08:11.830
Bina Barros.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.567
My God.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.727
I've seen all your films.

08:20.467 --> 08:23.227
Well, maybe
you can help me, darling.

08:27.467 --> 08:30.297
Back pain is a terrible,
terrible curse,

08:30.333 --> 08:33.602
but don't worry, Mrs Barros,
we'll have you down the beach

08:33.633 --> 08:36.303
enjoying your holiday again.

08:37.533 --> 08:39.273
Diazepam. 10mg.

08:39.299 --> 08:41.669
That's it. Thank you, my hero.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.500
I just need to check
with the doctors.

08:50.833 --> 08:53.273
- Does that hurt?
- Of course.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.030
Good.

08:56.067 --> 08:58.597
- How about that?
- Yes.

08:58.633 --> 09:01.703
I never liked your singing,
but your acting's even worse.

09:01.733 --> 09:03.303
If you really need diazepam,

09:03.333 --> 09:05.433
you'd be complaining
a lot more than that.

09:05.467 --> 09:07.267
I suspect your back is fine.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.730
No, darling, it's not.
It really...

09:08.767 --> 09:11.067
You'll get nothing
without a prescription.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.100
Please leave.

09:21.367 --> 09:24.097
So you didn't catch
any registration?

09:24.133 --> 09:27.403
I was sweeping the sidewalk,
minding my business,

09:27.433 --> 09:30.073
when I felt this enormous force
lifting me...

09:31.600 --> 09:34.270
..and a flash of light,

09:34.300 --> 09:37.730
and then this beautiful silver
angel looking down at me.

09:37.767 --> 09:40.627
- A silver angel?
- Then nothing but black.

09:40.667 --> 09:44.127
So you saw an angel but not
a simple registration plate?

09:44.167 --> 09:49.167
The shock, no doubt. Perhaps
a near-death experience?

09:49.200 --> 09:52.830
You didn't see a registration,
but you saw God.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.527
Mr Davé, can you feel it
when I do this?

09:59.167 --> 10:00.467
Not a scratch.

10:01.833 --> 10:04.633
You've done a wonderful job,
Dr Walker.

10:04.667 --> 10:07.197
So what happens now?

10:07.233 --> 10:10.103
I just need to discuss something
with Dr Fonseca.

10:10.133 --> 10:11.573
Doctor?

10:16.800 --> 10:19.670
Wait. I'm so sorry.

10:19.700 --> 10:23.130
- Don't worry, darling.
- Could you, please?

10:23.167 --> 10:24.797
No need.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.797
My pleasure, darling.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.330
Thank you.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.127
Amputation?

10:48.167 --> 10:50.367
The foot is
critically ischaemic.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.300
The results confirm it.

10:53.333 --> 10:55.403
Probably
a popliteal laceration

10:55.433 --> 10:58.403
- at the time of the accident.
- So we just repair it?

10:58.433 --> 11:00.833
Dr Nair is good
but he's no vascular surgeon.

11:00.867 --> 11:04.227
Thank you for reminding me,
but it's true.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.567
This procedure
I cannot carry out.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.100
Only a specialist can do this.

11:09.133 --> 11:11.073
I'm sorry, but AJ and I...

11:11.100 --> 11:12.570
Yeah, go.
We can deal with this.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.770
Then I'll prepare
the transfer to Kochi.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.130
I'm sorry, Dr Walker,
it's not that simple.

11:17.167 --> 11:19.097
I understand Mr Davé
has no insurance.

11:19.133 --> 11:20.733
He sweeps streets for a living,

11:20.767 --> 11:23.397
so unless he found a policy
lying on the side of the road...

11:23.433 --> 11:25.733
A repair like this costs
thousands, so without funds

11:25.767 --> 11:28.667
or insurance, the best we can do
is a good, clean amputation.

11:28.700 --> 11:31.230
So he loses his leg
because he's poor?

11:31.267 --> 11:34.127
There must be something else
we can do.

11:34.167 --> 11:36.067
There's no choice.
Want me to talk to him?

11:40.067 --> 11:43.227
No. No, he's my patient.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.767
I should tell him.

12:07.767 --> 12:10.667
It'll be happy hour
in half an hour.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.700
I need a drink.

12:17.733 --> 12:19.773
Then, sir, you have come
to the right place.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.200
I'll be the judge of that.
I want a warm pint,

12:22.233 --> 12:23.733
a proper beer,
in a straight glass.

12:31.367 --> 12:32.727
Sadler's?

12:32.767 --> 12:35.227
- Bloody hell.
- Allow me.

12:42.400 --> 12:46.070
Allow it to settle first.
Savour it.

12:51.100 --> 12:54.430
- You're not from round here.
- Dudley, born and bred.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.700
Let me guess. Aston.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.703
Close enough.

12:59.733 --> 13:01.533
Christ, you travel halfway
around the world

13:01.567 --> 13:03.397
and still get served
by a bloody Yam Yam.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.397
Cheers.

13:07.667 --> 13:08.997
Cheers.

13:21.367 --> 13:24.027
- It's a bit early for that, no?
- Ha!

13:24.067 --> 13:27.467
It's for him. His daughter's
getting married.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.030
Trust me, he'll need a drink.

13:32.567 --> 13:35.367
Wow. Mumbai
has been good to him.

13:35.400 --> 13:39.070
Well, he is Mumbai's
premier vascular surgeon.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.700
- Rambo!
- Varun.

13:43.633 --> 13:46.833
My God. What's happened
to all your hair?

13:46.867 --> 13:49.397
You must be a worried man, no?

13:49.433 --> 13:51.603
Don't worry, I know someone
who can fix that.

13:51.633 --> 13:54.603
Come, come. So you still play
Ping-Pong?

13:54.633 --> 13:56.503
Er, I'm afraid not.

13:56.533 --> 13:59.203
AJ, your father and I were
on the school team,

13:59.233 --> 14:02.633
national champions,
but he could never beat me.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.767
- That's right.
- Here, come this way.

14:04.800 --> 14:07.600
Ping-Pong?

14:07.633 --> 14:10.503
So what do you think?

14:10.533 --> 14:12.403
Absolutely stunning, Varun.

14:12.433 --> 14:14.333
You see this, AJ?

14:14.367 --> 14:17.127
All this is possible
if you work hard.

14:17.167 --> 14:20.267
You know, money...cannot
buy you happiness,

14:20.300 --> 14:23.400
but it can buy you
a nice little summer house.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.433
It's so good to be back!

14:25.467 --> 14:27.427
AJ...

14:27.467 --> 14:29.367
Here's a little something
for you.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.700
I know you enjoy a good malt.

14:30.733 --> 14:33.333
- I'm afraid I've given up.
- Have you?

14:33.367 --> 14:36.597
Yes, but I'm sure someone else
will, er, enjoy that.

14:36.633 --> 14:40.033
And for the evening
entertainment,

14:40.067 --> 14:41.497
Bina Barros.

14:41.533 --> 14:43.433
The wife insisted.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.097
You have to make it happen, no?

14:46.133 --> 14:48.203
Now it's one down, one to go.

14:48.233 --> 14:50.273
My beautiful Aisha.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.670
I just need a brave man
to take on my Samira now.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.800
What the hell is happening?!

14:53.833 --> 14:57.703
AJ, you recognise
that racket? Come, come.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.133
Where are the pillows? Where
are the rest of the things?

15:03.167 --> 15:05.097
That's Samira?

15:09.767 --> 15:12.627
You should go and say hello, AJ.

15:12.667 --> 15:17.067
Girls, spark it up, finish your
rehearsal. What are you doing?

15:17.100 --> 15:19.100
What are these doing here?

15:22.367 --> 15:24.497
Thank God you're here.

15:24.533 --> 15:27.433
You were supposed to be here
two bloody hours ago.

15:27.467 --> 15:31.167
Anyway, tell your guys
to keep the food

15:31.200 --> 15:32.500
by the drinks table there

15:32.533 --> 15:35.233
and did you get the extra rice?

15:35.267 --> 15:38.267
Samira, it's me, AJ. Remember?

15:38.300 --> 15:40.500
When we were ten, you used
to have ponytails.

15:40.533 --> 15:43.103
I used to sneak up
behind you and...

15:43.133 --> 15:45.133
Yeah, I remember.

15:45.167 --> 15:47.267
What happened to the glasses?

15:47.300 --> 15:49.300
And the, er...

15:53.433 --> 15:56.203
I decided to change,

15:56.233 --> 15:59.403
but you, you look
exactly the same.

16:01.167 --> 16:02.597
Thanks.

16:04.267 --> 16:07.467
I told...I told you to finish
the rehearsals.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.630
Are you OK?

16:08.667 --> 16:11.467
No, it's just a sprain.
Nothing.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.500
Maybe I could take a look.
You know, I work at a hospital.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.503
- You're a doctor?
- A paramedic.

16:16.533 --> 16:18.573
Sort of.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.100
I drive the ambulance.

16:20.133 --> 16:22.803
At least you can drive.

16:22.833 --> 16:27.203
Jeez, you guys. I told you
to stop doing this.

16:27.233 --> 16:30.073
He just accepted the amputation,

16:30.100 --> 16:32.600
like I was suggesting removing
his wisdom teeth.

16:32.633 --> 16:34.233
You'll get used to it.

16:34.267 --> 16:38.727
There's a certain nobility
to fatalism.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.397
There's really nothing
we can do?

16:40.433 --> 16:42.203
Not unless we find the driver.

16:42.233 --> 16:45.133
- You can't come in.
- I've been waiting back there

16:45.167 --> 16:47.727
for over an hour.
What kind of hospital is this?

16:47.767 --> 16:49.327
Yours, I believe.

16:49.367 --> 16:53.197
I've tried to explain that
any patient refusing treatment

16:53.233 --> 16:56.673
- must sign a waiver.
- I am not signing anything.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.270
I'm sorry for the delay,
I was called away,

16:59.300 --> 17:02.700
but I can see you immediately if
you just go back to your room.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.069
Can you chase up
the blood results?

17:10.099 --> 17:11.500
- Yes, Doctor.
- Quickly.

17:11.532 --> 17:13.373
- Of course.
- Thank you.

17:19.867 --> 17:21.797
I don't think this is necessary.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.400
This scar - you've had
an operation recently?

17:37.433 --> 17:41.233
Yeah, about a month ago,
back in the UK. Just routine.

17:42.133 --> 17:43.633
Routine?

17:43.667 --> 17:45.427
This is a kidney transplant,
correct?

17:45.467 --> 17:48.767
It's fine. No complications.

17:48.800 --> 17:52.070
This trip was to help me try and
recuperate, a treat for myself.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.730
Dr Walker. I'm sorry.

17:53.767 --> 17:55.727
There's a delay on bloods.

17:55.767 --> 17:58.067
- Another hour at least.
- That's ridiculous.

17:58.100 --> 18:01.600
- I can't stay that long.
- I'm afraid you'll have to.

18:01.633 --> 18:04.073
Are you taking
anti-rejection drugs?

18:04.100 --> 18:05.530
Of course I am.

18:05.567 --> 18:08.127
Your immune system
may be weaker than normal.

18:08.167 --> 18:10.627
Any infection could quickly
become extremely serious.

18:10.667 --> 18:13.627
I need to check a few things,
keep you under observation.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.327
I'm OK.

18:15.367 --> 18:17.027
Really.

18:17.067 --> 18:19.327
I'm sorry, but under
the circumstances

18:19.367 --> 18:20.497
I absolutely insist.

18:25.533 --> 18:27.373
And how do you deal
with all of it?

18:27.400 --> 18:29.430
I have to admit, it is tough.

18:29.467 --> 18:32.327
Not this.
All the rest of it.

18:32.367 --> 18:34.497
The bloody chaos, heat,

18:34.533 --> 18:37.503
insects, people jabbering
in your ear the whole time.

18:37.533 --> 18:41.603
I find the secret is
just to go with the flow.

18:41.633 --> 18:44.433
The thing about India is
you have to be flexible,

18:44.467 --> 18:47.327
take what comes, don't try
and fight it all the time.

18:48.733 --> 18:50.533
It's what the locals do, anyway.

18:52.133 --> 18:54.373
Intrinsically flexible people.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.700
You know they have
a specific god for everything?

18:56.733 --> 19:00.033
- Is that right?
- Life, death,

19:00.067 --> 19:02.097
luck.

19:02.133 --> 19:04.373
You name it,
they've got a god for it.

19:05.433 --> 19:07.473
Except premature ejaculation.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.830
But he's coming any minute now.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.470
Are you quite sure
you're all right, love?

19:26.867 --> 19:29.097
I'm fine, my darling.

19:29.133 --> 19:31.503
It's just the sun.

19:31.533 --> 19:34.373
It's quite unbearable.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.430
I don't know
how you can stand it.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.267
You look very familiar.

19:40.867 --> 19:45.027
Fine. Show me your hand.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.730
Are you all right?

20:17.167 --> 20:19.097
I haven't a clue, mate.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.803
So that's what she told you?

20:23.833 --> 20:25.633
I admit it seems a bit strange.

20:25.667 --> 20:26.627
A procedure like that

20:26.667 --> 20:29.227
and then coming
all the way to India on her own.

20:29.267 --> 20:31.597
Strange is the word.

20:31.633 --> 20:35.473
But luckily, one of us
was not born yesterday.

20:39.833 --> 20:43.633
And so you were operated on
where exactly?

20:43.667 --> 20:45.627
My local hospital in Leeds.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.567
And the name of your surgeon?

20:49.300 --> 20:51.200
I can't recall.

20:51.233 --> 20:52.773
And this procedure
happened when?

20:52.800 --> 20:55.370
A few weeks ago, by the age
of this wound?

20:55.400 --> 20:57.570
- Yes, but...
- Yet you can't

20:57.600 --> 20:59.370
remember the man
who operated on you?

20:59.400 --> 21:01.070
Perhaps it was a woman.

21:03.067 --> 21:04.767
You know what?
I want to leave now.

21:04.800 --> 21:08.830
Of course you do,
because I think you're lying.

21:08.867 --> 21:12.167
This procedure was done
right here in India, wasn't it?

21:14.100 --> 21:15.730
That is
an outrageous suggestion.

21:15.767 --> 21:18.067
But still I believe it
to be the truth.

21:18.100 --> 21:19.630
How much did it cost you?

21:19.667 --> 21:22.267
A few thousand?
Or did you get a bargain?

21:22.300 --> 21:24.200
It's not true.

21:24.233 --> 21:27.233
You can't prove anything.

21:27.267 --> 21:29.567
I don't want this man
treating me any more.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.400
Listen, what you have done
is a crime, OK?

21:32.433 --> 21:35.103
So that's fine by me.
I'm very happy

21:35.133 --> 21:38.233
to leave you in Dr Walker's...
capable hands.

21:38.267 --> 21:41.197
Make sure she's fit enough
and then discharge her.

22:12.100 --> 22:13.370
Bina Barros.

22:13.400 --> 22:17.070
She's playing at Varun's wedding
and you almost killed her.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.730
I thought she was already dead.

22:18.767 --> 22:21.127
She nearly did,
the way you drive.

22:21.167 --> 22:22.527
Come on, now, help me lift her.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.103
Ma'am.

22:25.133 --> 22:27.003
Slowly.

22:29.067 --> 22:30.827
The blood reports
for your patient, Doctor.

22:30.867 --> 22:32.627
My apologies for the delay.

22:32.667 --> 22:34.667
The laboratory called them
through urgently.

22:34.700 --> 22:36.130
Thank you.

22:39.267 --> 22:41.527
That's impossible.

22:41.567 --> 22:43.367
The tests
we've done strongly suggest

22:43.400 --> 22:45.400
acute rejection
of the transplanted organ.

22:45.433 --> 22:49.803
No. No, they promised me
it would all be OK.

22:51.333 --> 22:53.203
We can help. Your immune system

22:53.233 --> 22:56.203
is trying to attack the
new organ. It's not too late.

22:56.233 --> 22:57.803
We can offer
basic treatment here.

22:57.833 --> 22:59.473
Liars.

22:59.500 --> 23:01.130
Liars and cheats.

23:01.167 --> 23:04.527
I mean, it was supposed to be
a perfect match, right?

23:04.567 --> 23:09.127
Because I signed a contract
and they assured me

23:09.167 --> 23:13.297
that it would all be OK.

23:13.333 --> 23:14.733
I know how distressing
this must be.

23:14.767 --> 23:18.227
Don't you dare put
your disgusting hands on me.

23:18.267 --> 23:20.067
I'm sorry.

23:20.100 --> 23:22.530
Don't either... No, don't either
of you touch me.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.467
I want you to
keep your voice down, madam.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.100
You're disturbing the patients.

23:27.133 --> 23:28.433
I can handle this.

23:31.067 --> 23:32.767
You've just had
very upsetting news.

23:34.533 --> 23:36.373
People say things
they don't mean.

23:37.367 --> 23:38.627
Yeah.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.667
Maybe some do,

23:40.700 --> 23:44.330
but me, I call it as I see it,

23:44.367 --> 23:46.627
and all I can see

23:46.667 --> 23:50.197
right now is a filthy country

23:50.233 --> 23:52.503
full of liars
and full of cheats.

23:52.533 --> 23:54.603
Let me tell you
what I'm looking at!

23:54.633 --> 23:56.403
A woman who has travelled
to my country

23:56.433 --> 23:58.403
to steal an organ
from another human being,

23:58.433 --> 24:01.633
someone they've never even met,
a human being so desperate

24:01.667 --> 24:04.667
they're prepared to sell a part
of themselves to pay their rent

24:04.700 --> 24:06.370
and put food on their table

24:06.400 --> 24:08.270
to allow their children
to have a future.

24:08.300 --> 24:10.200
And I'll tell you
what you should do.

24:10.233 --> 24:12.333
You should have the courage
to meet that person

24:12.367 --> 24:14.397
and look them in the eye
and then you should

24:14.433 --> 24:16.273
get down on your knees
and thank them,

24:16.300 --> 24:17.830
because let me tell you, madam,

24:17.867 --> 24:20.527
you are not fit
to lick their boots.

24:23.300 --> 24:26.070
Treat her and then get her
the hell out of here.

24:36.200 --> 24:40.100
What the hell was that about?
I told you I could handle it.

24:40.133 --> 24:42.573
Yes, I heard you.
You apologised to her.

24:42.600 --> 24:45.600
She told you not to touch her
and you apologise to her?

24:45.633 --> 24:49.733
No, not really. I just needed
her to calm down.

24:49.767 --> 24:51.827
- She was emotional.
- Yeah. She insulted you.

24:51.867 --> 24:55.027
And I said I could handle it.

24:55.067 --> 24:57.497
It's not the first time I've
dealt with someone like this.

24:57.533 --> 24:59.773
So you just accept it? That
how it works in England?

24:59.800 --> 25:02.330
A woman like you allows herself
to be treated like that?

25:02.367 --> 25:04.567
It happens
and you have to deal with it.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.230
You can't just react. You
maintain a professional manner.

25:08.267 --> 25:10.067
I see.
So I'm not professional?

25:10.100 --> 25:13.100
You screamed at a patient.
My patient.

25:13.133 --> 25:14.603
Not professional.

25:14.633 --> 25:17.173
Well, then, Dr Walker,
for that I apologise.

25:17.200 --> 25:20.470
Clearly I am mistaken, but I
remind you this is my country

25:20.500 --> 25:22.670
and here a brown person
doesn't have to apologise

25:22.700 --> 25:24.100
for the colour of their skin.

25:24.133 --> 25:26.103
- Enough.
- Maybe you should learn it.

25:26.133 --> 25:27.833
I said enough.

25:27.867 --> 25:29.567
I will not accept
members of my staff

25:29.600 --> 25:32.230
having slanging matches
in the corridors of my hospital,

25:32.267 --> 25:33.667
no matter what the provocation.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.700
You, go and consent Mr Davé.

25:35.733 --> 25:38.233
If you're going to cut his leg
off, get his permission.

25:39.467 --> 25:41.327
What are you waiting for?

26:05.433 --> 26:07.203
Everyone deserves a holiday.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.773
Holiday?
I'm here for the duration.

26:11.433 --> 26:13.303
Or at least...

26:14.200 --> 26:16.570
My wife's sick. Maggie.

26:19.733 --> 26:21.103
Cancer.

26:22.333 --> 26:24.373
- Terminal.
- I'm sorry.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.130
Really.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.497
Should've gone home weeks ago,

26:28.533 --> 26:31.473
but she's got it in her head
that she wants to stay here.

26:33.733 --> 26:36.073
You know the worst of it?

26:36.100 --> 26:37.800
There's nothing I can do.

26:37.833 --> 26:40.333
I'm a practical man, you know?

26:40.367 --> 26:42.197
The sort that takes care
of things.

26:42.233 --> 26:44.073
I can fix a boiler,

26:45.133 --> 26:46.673
but I can't fix this.

26:46.700 --> 26:49.370
Does she want you to, fix it?

26:49.400 --> 26:51.170
Who knows?

26:51.200 --> 26:53.000
She likes it here?

26:53.733 --> 26:56.033
Loves it.

26:56.067 --> 26:57.297
Mad for it.

26:57.333 --> 27:00.103
Well, then, maybe
that's the best you can do.

27:01.533 --> 27:03.333
Whisky?

27:04.300 --> 27:05.770
Yeah.

27:10.633 --> 27:15.203
It's so sad. Fame and fortune
takes a heavy toll sometimes.

27:15.233 --> 27:17.703
Get her a drip, a vitamin shot

27:17.733 --> 27:20.503
and some painkillers.
Nothing too strong.

27:20.533 --> 27:22.373
I need to make a phone call.

27:22.400 --> 27:25.230
Varun is going to be
a very worried man.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.170
They're about to consent
your husband for surgery.

27:32.200 --> 27:35.130
I understand. Thank you.

27:36.667 --> 27:39.167
My husband's a fool, Dr Walker,

27:39.200 --> 27:41.370
but he's a good man.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.270
We were about
to start something together...

27:46.400 --> 27:48.430
..and I know how this world is.

27:48.467 --> 27:51.427
If he cannot walk,
he cannot work,

27:54.067 --> 27:55.497
and we have nothing.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.230
I'm sorry.

27:58.267 --> 28:00.427
I wish there was something
I could do.

28:03.533 --> 28:06.403
- Rambo!
- I'm sorry I had to call you.

28:06.433 --> 28:09.573
- What happened?
- Your wedding singer is here.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.330
Bina Barros.

28:11.367 --> 28:14.067
- What's wrong with her?
- We found her at the roadside.

28:28.367 --> 28:30.797
He said when the car hit him
he saw a silver angel.

28:30.833 --> 28:33.273
It has to be him.
He's the one who hit Rasik.

28:33.300 --> 28:36.170
You've brought me gold. Now
I'll show you how to spend it.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.730
The whole idea is preposterous.

28:41.767 --> 28:44.397
I don't agree. I think the
evidence stacks up rather well,

28:44.433 --> 28:46.273
but heaven forbid
I should be accused

28:46.300 --> 28:47.600
of running a kangaroo court.

28:47.633 --> 28:49.303
We must ensure this is fair.

28:49.333 --> 28:51.533
Dr Walker, please inform
the police immediately.

28:51.567 --> 28:52.797
Yes, Dr Fonseca.

28:52.833 --> 28:55.533
I think they should assess the
evidence and let them decide.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.597
No, no, please.
Let's not be too hasty.

28:57.633 --> 29:00.473
Obviously, this is
a rather awkward situation.

29:00.500 --> 29:03.670
Perhaps I should go and see
the poor fellow first,

29:03.700 --> 29:05.270
talk to him?

29:05.833 --> 29:07.773
Follow me.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.130
Argh!

29:10.167 --> 29:14.067
I agree. Likely
popliteal laceration.

29:14.100 --> 29:17.770
- Argh!
- It's tricky, but...

29:17.800 --> 29:20.130
You have a theatre free?

29:20.167 --> 29:22.227
Prepped for a below-knee
amputation.

29:25.200 --> 29:29.300
Mr Davé, my name
is Dr Varun Kapoor.

29:29.333 --> 29:31.403
I'm an experienced
vascular surgeon

29:31.433 --> 29:33.473
and with your permission

29:33.500 --> 29:35.630
I would like
to try and save your leg.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.470
Go on, say it, Dr Walker.
I know you want to.

29:51.500 --> 29:55.770
He hit him and now we just
allow him to get away with it.

29:55.800 --> 29:58.370
Sometimes, the wise woman
sees a compromise

29:58.400 --> 30:00.330
and grabs it with both hands,

30:00.367 --> 30:03.597
and if someone does tell
the police, then I will fire you

30:03.633 --> 30:05.373
and that's a promise.

30:10.433 --> 30:12.633
I'm so sorry
it has come to this.

30:12.667 --> 30:15.767
For someone so talented
to end up like this...

30:15.800 --> 30:19.300
I suppose it is
a sickness of sorts.

30:19.333 --> 30:21.703
Darling, you think
I'm a drinker,

30:21.733 --> 30:24.573
- a common alcoholic.
- We can help,

30:24.600 --> 30:27.370
advise a support group.

30:28.833 --> 30:30.673
An alcoholic?

30:30.700 --> 30:34.200
You must believe me, I've never
touched a drop in my life

30:34.233 --> 30:36.433
until today,
but what else could I do?

30:36.467 --> 30:40.067
Your doctor just won't give me
what I need to perform.

30:40.100 --> 30:42.700
If only there was
something else I could take,

30:42.733 --> 30:44.773
or someone I could turn to.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.800
Varun assures me he had no
idea he clipped the gentleman.

30:51.833 --> 30:54.203
Clipped?
A compound spiral fracture

30:54.233 --> 30:56.333
is hardly the result
of a glancing blow.

30:56.367 --> 30:58.627
I had to stop Dr Walker
from calling the police.

30:58.667 --> 31:00.767
Of course, she now thinks
I'm a cynical harpy.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.770
Please, surely
that's not necessary.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.070
Most people
would consider it compulsory.

31:05.100 --> 31:07.030
It's his daughter's wedding,
Lydia.

31:07.067 --> 31:10.197
You should see up there -
the guests, the servants,

31:10.233 --> 31:12.733
the whole family.
And now he has Bina Barros

31:12.767 --> 31:14.497
lying comatosed in the ward.

31:14.533 --> 31:16.433
Surely the poor man
has things on his mind.

31:16.467 --> 31:19.327
- Pity it wasn't the road.
- His daughter, Lydia.

31:19.367 --> 31:21.427
The biggest week in his life.

31:21.467 --> 31:23.467
My God, Lydia, I tell you,
if you had children

31:23.500 --> 31:25.070
you would understand.

31:51.433 --> 31:53.573
Look what the cat dragged in.

31:54.500 --> 31:56.230
You're pissed.

31:56.267 --> 31:58.497
And you, my dear, are sober,

31:58.533 --> 32:01.473
but in the morning
I will be beautiful.

32:01.500 --> 32:03.400
Anyway, I thought
we were supposed

32:03.433 --> 32:04.733
to be enjoying ourselves.

32:04.767 --> 32:08.067
We are, just not usually
this early.

32:08.100 --> 32:11.200
I went for a walk.
I got you something.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.170
Hold on.

32:20.267 --> 32:22.027
You found me a shell.

32:22.067 --> 32:23.427
I thought you'd like it.

32:23.467 --> 32:25.267
I do like it.

32:26.533 --> 32:29.233
In fact, I'm going
to put it here,

32:29.267 --> 32:31.397
pride of place.

32:34.633 --> 32:37.033
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

32:38.867 --> 32:40.427
It's OK.

32:41.467 --> 32:43.727
Let's not fight any more.

32:44.733 --> 32:46.333
Not now.

32:46.367 --> 32:47.997
OK.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.330
I am pissed.

32:57.367 --> 32:59.827
I know.

33:05.767 --> 33:09.167
So, Varun, I believe you have
saved his leg.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.700
I'll stake my reputation on it.

33:11.733 --> 33:14.673
You know, if you really
want to get away from here

33:14.700 --> 33:17.630
and taste the bright lights,
you could come and join me.

33:17.667 --> 33:18.767
- In Mumbai?
- Why not?

33:18.800 --> 33:22.170
Now that the hospital has got
so big, my real problem

33:22.200 --> 33:24.100
is keeping control of my staff.

33:24.133 --> 33:27.803
I need someone I can trust,
someone to keep them in line,

33:27.833 --> 33:29.773
manage costs,
that sort of thing.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.330
- Like an administrator?
- Maybe.

33:32.367 --> 33:34.527
But, no, no, we'll give you
a proper title?

33:34.567 --> 33:39.097
How does
Deputy Chief Executive sound?

33:41.400 --> 33:43.670
Well, give it some thought?

33:53.100 --> 33:55.230
Careful, Ms Barros. Careful.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.227
OK, slowly, slowly.

33:57.267 --> 33:59.097
Slowly. OK.

33:59.133 --> 34:02.133
OK, OK.

34:02.167 --> 34:04.467
I shouldn't have said
what I did.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.300
It was unkind.

34:07.333 --> 34:10.632
There. All's well
that ends well?

34:10.667 --> 34:13.266
Please come to the party.
You're all invited.

34:13.300 --> 34:15.670
Thank you, but I have work
to do, as do my staff.

34:15.699 --> 34:18.800
I've just finished my shift.
If I could, I'd love

34:18.833 --> 34:20.503
to watch Ms Barros.

34:20.533 --> 34:23.373
Well, then you shall
come to the ball.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.570
Wonderful, wonderful.
Thank you. Thank you.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.830
Thank you, my old friend,
you really saved me.

34:27.867 --> 34:29.427
No problem, no problem.

34:29.467 --> 34:32.167
- And I'll see you later, OK?
- Yes, you will.

34:32.199 --> 34:34.330
And don't forget about my offer.

34:34.367 --> 34:36.067
OK?

34:41.699 --> 34:43.030
Doctor?

34:46.533 --> 34:49.402
Look, what I said
was unforgivable

34:49.433 --> 34:51.103
and I want to apologise.

34:53.067 --> 34:55.367
So my kidneys failed
ten years ago.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.130
They just stopped working.

34:59.167 --> 35:01.097
Acute glomerulonephritis.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.130
Still can't spell it.

35:04.167 --> 35:06.397
They told me it wasn't my fault,

35:06.433 --> 35:08.473
it was nothing I'd done.

35:08.500 --> 35:11.030
I didn't smoke, I didn't drink,

35:11.067 --> 35:13.197
but that was it - dialysis.

35:13.233 --> 35:16.403
Three times a week
back in that little room

35:16.433 --> 35:19.533
with that sodding machine
whirring away.

35:19.567 --> 35:23.497
They put me into a prison
and I'd done nothing,

35:23.533 --> 35:26.773
but that's what it felt like
for ten years.

35:26.800 --> 35:29.700
The steroids I gave you
should stop the rejection,

35:29.733 --> 35:32.203
at least long enough
for you to get home.

35:32.233 --> 35:33.503
With the right treatment,

35:33.533 --> 35:35.533
there's every chance
they can save it.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.597
- The police?
- They'll be informed

35:37.633 --> 35:39.573
in the morning.

35:42.133 --> 35:43.503
I think
there's a flight tonight.

36:53.433 --> 36:55.233
Him! Him!

36:57.200 --> 36:58.530
How are you?

37:02.100 --> 37:04.270
Drink, Dad?

37:05.667 --> 37:08.167
Can I get you a drink?

37:08.200 --> 37:10.470
I don't think anyone's
had your whisky.

37:13.700 --> 37:15.070
Yeah.

37:31.300 --> 37:32.830
Sorry.

37:32.867 --> 37:34.597
Excuse me.

37:36.767 --> 37:39.397
Thank God!
I was beginning to think...

37:39.433 --> 37:41.233
You can have them.

37:42.467 --> 37:44.297
But you don't need them.

37:44.333 --> 37:46.433
Please, listen to me first.

37:48.067 --> 37:51.227
When I was a child,
I heard your words

37:51.267 --> 37:53.197
more than my parents'.

37:53.233 --> 37:56.803
I knew your voice
better than theirs.

37:56.833 --> 38:01.403
When I was studying, I listened
to nothing but your songs.

38:02.733 --> 38:04.773
So many lonely nights.

38:04.800 --> 38:08.830
But they made the world
seem full of possibility,

38:08.867 --> 38:11.667
like I could do anything.

38:12.700 --> 38:14.470
So can you.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.130
Thank you.

38:31.567 --> 38:33.797
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:33.833 --> 38:35.673
Bina Barros!

39:01.267 --> 39:03.327
Come on, everybody!

39:29.167 --> 39:32.367
Bina, we love you!

39:36.433 --> 39:38.733
This is what she does.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.427
And then she turns up
and she does this and that.

39:41.467 --> 39:45.297
A-ha! Here come the party boys!

39:45.333 --> 39:48.203
I could tell you a few stories
about these two.

39:48.233 --> 39:50.603
If you think Samira's
a bully now,

39:50.633 --> 39:53.173
you should have seen
what she did to this boy

39:53.200 --> 39:54.700
when he was six.

39:54.733 --> 39:56.533
I remember...

39:56.567 --> 39:58.727
It's OK,
it's only a bit of water.

39:58.767 --> 40:01.597
- AJ.
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.433
It's OK, darling.

40:03.467 --> 40:05.397
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

40:08.767 --> 40:10.667
That's a seat-belt bruise.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.100
Is it?

40:18.700 --> 40:20.470
Tell me the truth.

40:20.500 --> 40:25.230
Samira likes to take
a little drive in the mornings.

40:25.267 --> 40:26.627
It clears her head.

40:28.533 --> 40:31.073
Come on, she's about
to finish college?

40:31.100 --> 40:32.500
No point in wrecking her future

40:32.533 --> 40:34.433
over a little thing like this,
is there?

40:35.833 --> 40:37.703
Little thing?

40:37.733 --> 40:40.303
Yes. You're a father.
You understand?

40:44.433 --> 40:46.633
- Rambo. Rambo!
- Come on, AJ.

40:46.667 --> 40:48.567
Leaving so soon, Rambo?

40:48.600 --> 40:50.770
Rambo! Rambo!

41:02.133 --> 41:03.833
She apologised.

41:03.867 --> 41:06.297
I told her to go home.

41:06.333 --> 41:08.333
She should be arrested.

41:08.367 --> 41:09.997
Maybe.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.770
Wait.

41:15.367 --> 41:17.167
I, erm,

41:17.200 --> 41:19.330
I thought about what you said

41:19.367 --> 41:21.727
and you were right
about...about me.

41:24.733 --> 41:26.803
All my life I've had
to listen to stuff like that,

41:26.833 --> 41:30.103
all the comments,
the little things.

41:30.133 --> 41:31.803
Sometimes just abuse,
to be honest.

41:33.533 --> 41:36.003
And I just take it,
turn the other cheek,

41:37.867 --> 41:41.597
maybe because I've always
wanted to fit in.

41:41.633 --> 41:44.733
When Marcus and I
were together,

41:44.767 --> 41:48.097
we'd walk into a pub
and I could almost hear

41:48.133 --> 41:50.233
what they were thinking.

41:50.267 --> 41:53.327
"What's he doing?
Why is he with her?

41:54.800 --> 41:57.400
Couldn't he find himself
a white girlfriend?"

42:00.367 --> 42:03.167
You shouldn't let it
get to you?

42:03.200 --> 42:06.630
Not then and...and not now.

42:06.667 --> 42:08.467
I know, you're right,

42:08.500 --> 42:10.630
and this is your country.

42:10.667 --> 42:14.127
I don't know,
maybe now it's mine, too.

42:19.233 --> 42:20.603
Maybe.

42:27.700 --> 42:29.500
You should try it, you know?

42:30.633 --> 42:33.033
Righteous anger.

42:33.067 --> 42:34.827
It clears the head.

42:34.867 --> 42:36.827
And the sinuses.

42:44.133 --> 42:46.473
So do you give lessons?

42:50.600 --> 42:53.130
You couldn't afford me,
you know.

43:09.833 --> 43:12.433
That looks
absolutely disgusting.

43:14.267 --> 43:16.367
Like so many things in life,

43:16.400 --> 43:19.530
it tastes better than it looks.

43:19.567 --> 43:22.127
Cheers.

43:23.500 --> 43:25.100
You know the drill.

43:25.133 --> 43:27.173
You really are ashamed of me,
aren't you?

43:27.200 --> 43:30.070
My fault for consorting with
a barely functioning alcoholic.

43:30.100 --> 43:33.330
One day I'll meet a woman who
appreciates me for who I am.

43:33.367 --> 43:36.527
