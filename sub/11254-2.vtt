about this at home.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.828
{\an3}- Whoa, Boyce,
this is very important.

15:12.911 --> 15:14.872
- Okay, look, Boyce,
I know you want to keep

15:14.955 --> 15:16.415
the campaign
in the family

15:16.498 --> 15:18.250
and stay true
to who you are,

15:18.334 --> 15:19.668
but the stakes
are too high.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.212
What you're fighting for
is too important.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.922
- This is gonna be
hard to hear, bro,

15:24.006 --> 15:25.799
but we've decided

15:25.883 --> 15:29.178
we're not the people
to run your campaign.

15:29.261 --> 15:34.099
- Wow. Wow.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.184
{\an1}- No, no, no.
No, no, no.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.896
Babe, don't try
to talk us out of it.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.649
- Oh, darn it.

15:41.732 --> 15:42.483
{\an3}Okay, I'll see
you guys at home.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.652
All right.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.695
{\an3}- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's it?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.072
{\an1}- Yeah, you said, "Don't try
to talk you out of it."

15:48.155 --> 15:50.824
{\an3}- Yeah, but don't you think
you should try

15:50.908 --> 15:53.202
{\an3}and talk us out of it
a little bit?

15:53.285 --> 15:55.245
- I'm sorry, Reverend,
but I have a 1:00,

15:55.329 --> 15:59.041
so if you're
going to be long.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.835
- Boyce, who is
this white woman?

16:01.919 --> 16:03.629
- She's--
- I'm Alicia Frizzell.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.215
- Look, Lolli, Stamps,

16:06.298 --> 16:09.510
{\an1}I decided to interview
a few campaign managers.

16:09.593 --> 16:12.846
- Wow. Wow.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.848
I can't believe this.
- You firing us?

16:14.932 --> 16:16.558
{\an3}- Yeah, what was all that talk
about "I want to do this with--"

16:16.642 --> 16:18.394
both: "My family."

16:18.477 --> 16:21.689
{\an1}- Really, do you guys really
think that you're up to the job?

16:21.772 --> 16:24.441
- No, we're terrible.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.026
{\an1}- Then what are we
arguing about?

16:26.110 --> 16:28.320
{\an1}- I don't know.
I'm mad.

16:30.322 --> 16:30.823
- Good news, Boyce.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.741
I called Fred.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.827
He's willing to give you
a second chance.

16:34.910 --> 16:38.372
You just got to prove to him
that you want it.

16:38.455 --> 16:39.373
- It's too late, Barton.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.959
{\an3}Boyce is about to hire
A-lee-sha.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.253
- Actually, it's A-lee-see-a.

16:44.336 --> 16:48.090
- Actually, I don't care.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.049
{\an3}- How could you do Fred
like this?

16:49.133 --> 16:52.094
{\an1}- Daddy, I was never
gonna hire Fred.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.345
- Anyway, Reverend,

16:53.429 --> 16:55.013
I think that
I'm going to scoot.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.473
- No, what? Why?

16:56.557 --> 16:57.933
{\an3}- Well, I just don't think
this is a situation

16:58.016 --> 16:59.810
{\an3}that makes sense for me,
professionally.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.229
{\an3}There is already a lot
of conflict,

17:02.312 --> 17:04.272
{\an3}and your family is
clearly dysfunctional.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.067
You're like the Jacksons.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.193
- Excuse me.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.194
{\an3}I--I thought Jermaine
was pretty cool.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.739
{\an3}- Was he?

17:11.821 --> 17:12.865
{\an3}Anyway,
before I go,

17:12.948 --> 17:16.410
let me give you
a little advice.

17:16.492 --> 17:17.953
{\an3}Running a campaign
with your family

17:18.037 --> 17:19.621
is a very dicey proposition.

17:19.704 --> 17:20.955
You need someone
who can give you

17:21.039 --> 17:22.207
an outside perspective.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.125
For instance,
you don't run

17:23.208 --> 17:25.711
{\an3}a political campaign
out of a church.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.045
It's a violation
of about 40 laws.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.132
- Is it?
- I didn't know that, no.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.508
{\an3}- Yes.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.595
{\an3}Also, you don't start riots
in rib joints.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.763
{\an3}You don't
do radio shows

17:35.846 --> 17:37.556
{\an3}with anyone
called "Shank,"

17:37.639 --> 17:41.143
{\an3}and you never pose for a photo
eating a corndog.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.978
{\an1}- Okay, I didn't do
that one, now.

17:43.061 --> 17:46.648
{\an3}- The way things are going,
you will.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.400
{\an3}Good luck
with your campaign.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.694
- Alicia, don't leave.

17:50.778 --> 17:51.695
You're hired.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.655
{\an3}- I haven't told you
my fee yet.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.533
{\an1}You're still hired.
What's your fee?

17:58.744 --> 17:59.745
- Good Lord.

17:59.828 --> 18:03.832
{\an1}- Are we hiring you
or sending you to college?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.709
{\an1}- Fred's only $40 a day
plus gas.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.212
- There he is, Joe.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.511
{\an3}- Here's your catfish.
Vote for Boyce.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.889
- Vote for Boyce.
Gizzards up.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.141
{\an3}- Alicia, I got to
hand it to you.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.976
This is a great event.

18:23.060 --> 18:23.894
{\an1}- Oh, please, announcements
are the easy part.

18:23.977 --> 18:25.896
Anyone who can't do that

18:25.979 --> 18:27.648
{\an1}has no business
going near a campaign.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.942
- Uh, you do know

18:30.025 --> 18:32.027
{\an1}that we were kind of
running the campaign before?

18:32.110 --> 18:33.195
- Yes.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.363
- Oh, all right.

18:34.446 --> 18:37.991
{\an1}- You see, Lolli, the key
to an event like this

18:38.075 --> 18:38.826
{\an1}is to stack the crowd
with friendlies

18:38.909 --> 18:39.993
and promise them free food,

18:40.077 --> 18:43.205
{\an1}but--and this is
the key part--

18:43.288 --> 18:46.166
{\an1}you don't feed them
till after the announcement.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.836
{\an3}- Well, I'm glad you
learned from my mistake.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.463
{\an1}- Well, you made
a lot of 'em.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.257
- You're welcome.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.925
- Hey, Lolli.
Tay Tay's busy.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.386
{\an1}Can you come help
get these ribs out?

18:57.469 --> 18:58.595
- Who waiting on red pop?

18:58.679 --> 19:00.681
- Wings up.
Brisket up!

19:00.764 --> 19:02.599
{\an3}- Come on,
Tay Tay's in the weeds.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.351
{\an1}- Oh, no, that's not
really my thing.

19:04.434 --> 19:07.312
- Oh, girl, you in it now.

19:07.396 --> 19:08.480
- I got wings.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.398
- I got pulled pork
and collards.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.484
- I've got some kind of meat.
