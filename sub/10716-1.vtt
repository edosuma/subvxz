WEBVTT

00:12.313 --> 00:14.248
Last season on "Bosch"...

00:14.248 --> 00:16.050
Freeze!

00:16.050 --> 00:17.786
Detective, how many
people have you killed?

00:17.786 --> 00:20.521
- I don't know.
- The department
exonerated you.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.090
It was a good shooting.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.695
Have you been to see her yet?

00:26.695 --> 00:28.496
Harry, Vegas is
a four-hour drive.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.398
Hey, Maddie.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.967
30 seconds in,
you're already accusing me
of being a bad parent.

00:32.967 --> 00:35.637
- That's a cold plate, partner.
- You put it in correctly?

00:35.637 --> 00:37.672
Yeah, man, light him up.

00:37.672 --> 00:40.474
This is my vehicle.
Those are my plates.

00:40.474 --> 00:45.479
- Shit! Hey!
- Let's start off
with an easy one.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.015
Who's the dead guy
in the van?

00:47.015 --> 00:49.117
When Officer Pierce
and Irving Junior

00:49.117 --> 00:50.652
pulled over
this Waits character,

00:50.652 --> 00:54.155
apparently, Irving
deliberately punched in

00:54.155 --> 00:55.489
the wrong plate number.

00:55.489 --> 00:57.325
Even if I don't use
my influence on your behalf,

00:57.325 --> 00:59.093
just the fact you're my son,
others will,

00:59.093 --> 01:00.428
and that can be tricky
for both of us.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.063
I hear you've tentatively

01:02.063 --> 01:03.832
identified
the Laurel Canyon victim.

01:03.832 --> 01:05.634
His name was Arthur Delacroix.
He was 12 years old.

01:05.634 --> 01:07.335
Waits confessed
to killing him.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.203
O'Shea's planning
to run for mayor.

01:09.203 --> 01:12.140
So this Waits case?
Pure political Viagra for him.

01:12.140 --> 01:15.009
Mr. Waits is gonna direct us
to the crime scenes,

01:15.009 --> 01:17.211
and we will be on top
of his every move.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.213
Maybe we should loosen
his shackles.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.782
- We don't need a lawsuit here.
- No fuckin' way.

01:20.782 --> 01:23.517
Bosch, just do it!

01:23.517 --> 01:25.854
Shit!

01:30.759 --> 01:33.494
- Harry, don't!
- Shots fired! Officer down!

01:33.494 --> 01:35.129
My partner
is in foot pursuit

01:35.129 --> 01:37.198
and his direction
of travel is unknown.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.333
We're in the L.A. river
at 6th street.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.873
- Tell me you got it.
- I got it, yeah,

01:44.873 --> 01:46.440
- but he took the card.
- Who took the card?

01:46.440 --> 01:49.077
- O'Shea.
- You keep the video
under wraps,

01:49.077 --> 01:51.112
I win the election,
you're the next chief of police.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.546
I'm the monument.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.716
Me! Me!

01:56.685 --> 01:58.987
- I'm tired of your bullshit.
- Why don't you do
something about it.

01:58.987 --> 02:01.089
Don't walk away from--

02:05.093 --> 02:06.995
How could you let him
get to you like that?

02:06.995 --> 02:09.063
He put his hands on me first.

02:52.306 --> 02:55.376
How did it go?
Did you talk to him yet?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.111
What did he say?
What's gonna happen?

02:57.111 --> 03:00.581
Gonna be okay, baby.
I talked to the man himself.

03:00.581 --> 03:01.816
So you talked to him
this morning?

03:01.816 --> 03:02.951
Last night.

03:02.951 --> 03:04.753
He's gonna talk to Lucky?

03:04.753 --> 03:06.154
He said he'd take care of it.

03:06.154 --> 03:08.122
How do you know?
Are you sure?

03:08.122 --> 03:10.191
He said he'd take care of it,
he'll take care of it--

03:10.191 --> 03:13.294
Can you make sure? Tony?

03:16.765 --> 03:18.666
Tony!

03:18.666 --> 03:21.335
Gotta go, baby.
I'll call you later.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.381
- Thank you for stopping.
- Need help?

03:33.381 --> 03:35.784
I don't have my phone.

03:35.784 --> 03:37.018
Do you think you
could call me a tow?

03:37.018 --> 03:40.955
- What happened?
- I don't know.

03:40.955 --> 03:44.993
It just quit.

03:44.993 --> 03:46.861
No problem.
I'll call Triple A.

03:46.861 --> 03:48.162
Thank you.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.816

Hey, Maddie.
I'm in the middle of shaving.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.068
Call you back in five?

06:07.068 --> 06:08.769
- Okay. Dad?
- Yeah?

06:08.769 --> 06:10.438
Lose the sideburns.
You look like a hobo.

06:10.438 --> 06:13.374
A hobo?
Where'd you hear that word?

06:13.374 --> 06:15.176
It's retro.
From the Great Recession.

06:15.176 --> 06:17.811
- And the mustache, too.
- And the mustache?

06:17.811 --> 06:19.313
I kind of like it.

06:19.313 --> 06:20.949
Seventies porn star?
Hello?

06:20.949 --> 06:24.152
Yeah. Okay.
Call you back.

06:24.152 --> 06:25.954
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.396
Better?

06:35.396 --> 06:36.965
Awesome.
You look way younger.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.202
Listen. I'm just on my way
out the door.

06:41.202 --> 06:43.204
I know.
I was calling to wish you luck.

06:43.204 --> 06:44.605
Thanks. That's really
thoughtful of you.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.874
- Have a good day, Dad.
- You, too.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.409
Bye.

06:53.014 --> 06:54.382
**

07:13.734 --> 07:15.336

07:51.139 --> 07:53.374
- Hey, Harry, how's it hanging?
- Hey, Barrel.

07:53.374 --> 07:56.477
- Seen Edgar?
- Just got here.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.612
- Lieutenant's looking for him.
- I'll let him know.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.881
- Coffee? I'm gonna grab one.
- No, thanks.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.851
- Hey, Harry.
- J. Edgar.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.819
- Billets is looking for you.
- So I hear.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.123
Listen, you're ever interested
in selling your place,

08:09.123 --> 08:11.125
- I got a buyer.
- Not interested.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.594
- Serious inquiry.
- Non-starter.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.529
I mean, I wouldn't live
up there, but some folks

08:15.529 --> 08:17.665
like sticking a finger
in Mother Nature's eye.

08:17.665 --> 08:21.402
Hi, Jerry Edgar,
I'm calling for Charisse.

08:21.402 --> 08:25.273
You'd think I went out for
a pack of fucking cigarettes.

08:34.382 --> 08:37.451
Oh, you assholes.
Fuck you guys.

08:37.451 --> 08:40.954
Boom!

08:40.954 --> 08:43.624
Welcome back, partner.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.494
- Had you going, didn't we.
- Yeah, you did.

08:46.494 --> 08:50.098
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.

08:50.098 --> 08:51.432
You couldn't do better
than that?

08:51.432 --> 08:54.102
Drugs clouded
my mental acuity.

08:54.102 --> 08:56.104
But, hey, I am back,
sharp as ever.

08:56.104 --> 08:58.272
- That's a low bar.
- Harry Bosch?

09:01.942 --> 09:04.212
Now I feel like I'm at home.

09:04.212 --> 09:07.615
Chilton Hardy,
career sex offender.

09:07.615 --> 09:10.584
Serial rapist,
graduated to serial rape murder.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.253
Jerry and Ig have been
working the case.

09:12.253 --> 09:13.887
We think he's good
for about a dozen more.

09:13.887 --> 09:16.624
- California, Nevada.
- We got a line on this guy?

09:16.624 --> 09:18.959
Ig's got a line
on Hardy's father.
Panorama City.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.362
We're headed out there
now to talk to him.
See what he knows.

09:21.362 --> 09:23.897
Panorama City.
Doesn't get any
better than that.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.367
I want you to go with them.

09:26.367 --> 09:30.138
- We can handle it, Lieutenant.
- They can handle it,
Lieutenant.

09:30.138 --> 09:31.605
Tag along, Bosch.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.174
First day back.
Get your feet wet.

09:37.745 --> 09:40.348
Oh, I am loving
the enthusiasm, guys.

09:40.348 --> 09:42.150
- Bosch?
- Yes?

09:42.150 --> 09:45.553
You're gonna need these.

09:56.464 --> 09:58.065
Try to hang onto them
this time.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.401
Thanks.

10:12.146 --> 10:14.382
I'm looking
for the panorama.

10:14.382 --> 10:15.816
I just don't see it.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.952
This was all orange trees.

10:18.952 --> 10:23.991
After the war,
tore out the groves,
put in tract homes for GI's.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.959
American Dream.

10:25.959 --> 10:30.298
Every man a house, a car,
and a garage to put it in.

10:30.298 --> 10:31.899
Edgar and I will handle
the interview.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.301
Counting on it.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.540
I haven't seen Chilton
in years.

10:39.540 --> 10:42.410
Don't know where he is,
don't give a shit.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.613
He in some kind
of trouble again?

10:45.613 --> 10:47.248
We just wanna talk
to your son.

10:47.248 --> 10:48.482
His name came up
in an investigation.

10:48.482 --> 10:49.983
I'm gonna
take a look around.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.821
Don't you need a warrant?
He ain't here.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.757
- Can he just do that?
- Apparently.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.659
When was the last time
you talked to your son?

10:58.659 --> 10:59.993
Last time he got
out of the joint.

10:59.993 --> 11:03.397
Must have been going
on eight years ago.

11:03.397 --> 11:04.698
What'd he want?

11:04.698 --> 11:07.268
Money.

11:07.268 --> 11:09.770
I told him to go suck
on somebody else's tit.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.972
Where'd he call from?

11:11.972 --> 11:13.907
Tucson, maybe.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.267
I don't know why he turned out
the way he did.

11:39.267 --> 11:40.568
I blame his mother.

11:43.337 --> 11:46.507
Find what
you were looking for?

11:46.507 --> 11:50.378
- I told you he wasn't here.
- You haven't told us
where he is.

11:50.378 --> 11:52.446
How many times I got to tell
you? I don't know.

11:52.446 --> 11:54.648
- I think you do.
- Harassing a sick old man.

11:54.648 --> 11:58.085
- How sick are you, Mr. Hardy?
- Excuse me?

11:58.085 --> 11:59.820
I say, how sick are you?

11:59.820 --> 12:02.356
Real sick, you dumb shit.
Look around!

12:02.356 --> 12:05.593
- Oxygen, wheelchair bound.
- That's right.

12:05.593 --> 12:07.060
- Shit!
- Damn it!

12:07.060 --> 12:09.730
Chilton Hardy.
Hook him up. He's all yours.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.365
Freeze, asshole.
You're under arrest.

12:13.301 --> 12:14.935
Shit! Damn it!

12:14.935 --> 12:16.770
Keys!

13:13.527 --> 13:14.695
Hold still, asshole.

13:14.695 --> 13:17.865
Cuffs.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.833
- Fuck you.
- Shut up, asshole.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.869
Damn, Harry.
You're pretty good
for an old man.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.572
You been taking PEDs?

13:24.572 --> 13:26.239
You gotta get in shape,
J. Edgar.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.175
Work on your cardio.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.877
You gotta get
some different shoes.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.412
Can't run in
those roach killers.

13:31.412 --> 13:33.213
How often do I have to run?

13:33.213 --> 13:34.415
- Get up.
- Serious.

13:34.415 --> 13:36.249
Stand up.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.586
Damn it.

13:56.604 --> 13:57.605
Ow!

14:00.674 --> 14:01.742
Ow.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.779
Think you can handle him now?

14:08.916 --> 14:11.084
Friendly fella,
your ex-partner.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.553
Ex?

14:15.423 --> 14:17.057
- Mank.
- Captain.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.194
- Detective Bosch.
- Captain.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.596
First day back,
Billets tells me

14:22.596 --> 14:23.864
you already bagged a bad guy.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.466
No. That was Edgar
and Ferras.

14:25.466 --> 14:27.701
I was just
along for the ride.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.774
Good man, Mank.
Friend of yours.

14:33.774 --> 14:35.776
Lucky he saw Captain Pounds
grab you first, huh?

14:35.776 --> 14:37.110
And wasn't afraid to say so.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.046
You think maybe you
over-reacted?

14:39.046 --> 14:41.348
No, sir. I don't.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.050
All right, Bosch.

14:43.050 --> 14:46.920
You do your job,
keep your cool.
We'll get along.

14:55.496 --> 14:57.465
- That seemed to go well.
- Oh, yeah.

14:57.465 --> 14:58.666
Officer Friendly.

14:58.666 --> 15:00.768
All right.
Not warm and fuzzy.

15:00.768 --> 15:03.704
But on the plus side,
not Pounds.

15:03.704 --> 15:05.138
Where'd Pounds land, anyway?

15:05.138 --> 15:07.608
You're not gonna
believe it, Harry.

15:07.608 --> 15:10.744
- Art Theft Detail.
- You're right.
I don't believe it.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.213
- Fuck does he know about art?
- He knows what he likes.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.615
You're the worst.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.821
- Harry.
- He give it up yet?

15:20.821 --> 15:22.656
Just letting him marinate.

15:22.656 --> 15:25.392
Probably find his old man
buried underneath
the floorboards.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.728
I expect so.
Grab some lunch?

15:27.728 --> 15:29.563
Something I got to do.

15:34.134 --> 15:38.506
- I'd like you both
to be there.
- Short notice.

15:38.506 --> 15:43.043
The optics would enhance
the value of your
endorsements enormously.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.713
I preach on Sunday.

15:45.713 --> 15:47.981
The perfect venue.
Right after morning services.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.017
And with your family ties
to Greater Page

15:50.017 --> 15:52.185
and the West Adams
neighborhood--

15:52.185 --> 15:56.524
I'll save a pew down front
for both of you.

15:56.524 --> 15:58.091
And your wives.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.528
I trust there will be
a full house.

16:00.528 --> 16:02.596
You don't have to worry
about that.

16:02.596 --> 16:07.067
When I preach,
standing room only.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.803
Thank you both so much.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.040
To the next mayor
of Los Angeles.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.943
Here, here.

16:18.779 --> 16:20.981
Who signed Raynard Waits out of
custody at the jail that day?

16:20.981 --> 16:22.415
I did.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.552
Who was the ranking
LAPD officer at the scene?

16:24.552 --> 16:26.219
I was.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.221
- By whose authority?
- Deputy Chief Irving.

16:28.221 --> 16:31.124
- Chief Irving
put you in charge.
- Yes.

16:31.124 --> 16:35.028
Made you responsible for
Waits' custody on this
so-called field trip?

16:35.028 --> 16:36.263
Yes.

16:36.263 --> 16:40.634
- And security.
- Yes.

16:40.634 --> 16:42.570
When you arrived
at the abandoned factory,

16:42.570 --> 16:45.706
- who loosened Waits' shackles?
- I did.

16:45.706 --> 16:47.174
Under protest.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.142
I was ordered to do so
by the District Attorney.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.979
Just answer the question
put to you, Detective.

16:53.881 --> 16:57.985
- Who ordered Detective Moore
to re-cuff Mr. Waits?
- I did.

16:57.985 --> 17:00.888
And when Detective Moore
did that, what happened?

17:00.888 --> 17:02.923
Waits seized his weapon
and shot him.

17:02.923 --> 17:05.225
- Shot and wounded
Detective Moore.
- Yes.

17:05.225 --> 17:09.362
And then shot and killed Deputy
District Attorney Lou Escobar.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.598
Yes.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.904
Ask you something, Wash?

17:16.904 --> 17:18.305
Chief?

17:18.305 --> 17:21.809
Who you gonna vote for
next election for Mayor?

17:25.212 --> 17:28.448
- You do vote.
- Yes, sir.
You still endorsing O'Shea?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.718
- Told him I was.
- I'm for him if you are.

17:30.718 --> 17:33.086
I want you to vote
your conscience.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.855
He still gonna make you Chief?

17:34.855 --> 17:36.757
- Says he is.
- Then I'm voting for him.

17:36.757 --> 17:40.628
- Doesn't mean he will.
- I'll just have to roll
the dice on that.

17:40.628 --> 17:43.631
Yeah. Me, too.

17:43.631 --> 17:45.933
What do you hear
from his Grand Jury?

17:45.933 --> 17:48.636
My friend got transferred.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.981
Officer Pierce?

18:39.987 --> 18:42.690
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey. How was your day?

18:42.690 --> 18:44.257
I helped catch a bad guy.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.458
You didn't shoot him,
did you?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.127
- No.
- Good.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.562
'Cause I did not want to
see you on the Internet.
"Killer Cop."

18:49.562 --> 18:51.799
Did you get those LPs
I sent you?

18:51.799 --> 18:53.600
Yeah. I really love
the Grace Kelly one.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.202
She's playing here next week.
I might go see her.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.270
I could come out
and go with you.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.139
Well, you could come out,
but you couldn't go with me.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.709
- You're not twenty one.
- Ugh. That sucks.

19:01.709 --> 19:03.744
Yeah, it does.
How are things?

19:03.744 --> 19:07.180
Okay.
A little weird actually.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.917
Reggie left all of a sudden
on a business trip to Hong Kong.

19:09.917 --> 19:11.251
- Everything all right?
- I guess.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.753
I asked Mom
when he'd be back,

19:12.753 --> 19:14.154
and she was like,
"I don't know."

19:14.154 --> 19:16.156
Is she there?
Can I talk to her?

19:16.156 --> 19:18.391
- She's at the casino.
- You're there all alone?

19:18.391 --> 19:21.094
- Dad, I'm fifteen.
- When's she coming home?

19:21.094 --> 19:23.964
She said by midnight.
Do you want her to call you?

19:23.964 --> 19:25.966
- Midnight?
- Dad, chillax.

19:25.966 --> 19:27.968
It's normal.
Like every night.

19:27.968 --> 19:29.536
Do you want her
to call you or not?

19:29.536 --> 19:31.638
No, I'm gonna crash.
It's been a long day.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.173
Just tell her I called.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.442
Okay, when're you coming
out to Vegas?

19:35.442 --> 19:37.878
Soon. Promise.

19:37.878 --> 19:39.212
When are you coming
to LA?

19:39.212 --> 19:41.381
Soon. Promise.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.817
And everything's okay
with your mom and Reggie?

19:43.817 --> 19:45.552
- As far as I know.
- 'Kay.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.788
Talk soon.
I love you.

19:47.788 --> 19:49.322
I love you, too.
Bye.

20:10.911 --> 20:12.045
Six-L-Thirty-Four.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.646
Six-L-Thirty-Four, go.

20:13.646 --> 20:16.784
I have a vehicle illegally
parked and cited two days ago.

20:16.784 --> 20:18.551
Requesting
OPG tow my location,

20:18.551 --> 20:20.387
16500 Mulholland,

20:20.387 --> 20:23.090
silver Bentley,
California license.

20:23.090 --> 20:25.325
Six-L-thirty-four,
copy that.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.367
Oh.

20:37.871 --> 20:40.140
- Six-L-Thirty-Four.
- Six-L-Thirty-Four, go.

20:40.140 --> 20:41.374
Yeah, I'm gonna need
a supervisor here.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.748
Bosch.

20:48.748 --> 20:52.519
Hey, you know
Fire Station 109,
up Mulholland?

20:52.519 --> 20:54.554
- Yeah. Off Laurel Canyon.
- Yeah, that's the one.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.957
A patrol just found a body
in the trunk of a car.

20:56.957 --> 20:58.625
Looks like it's been there
a couple days.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.928
So I'm thinking
it's nice and ripe by now.

21:00.928 --> 21:03.263
Billets is on her way.
She asked me to call you.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.165
It's all hands on deck, Harry.

21:05.165 --> 21:07.400
You want me to call
Edgar and Ferras?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.536
- No, I'll call Edgar.
- Ferras?

21:09.536 --> 21:11.204
Forget Ferras.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.706
You wrote the ticket Sunday.

21:13.706 --> 21:14.975
Somebody called in
a complaint.

21:14.975 --> 21:16.243
What brought you
back here today?

21:16.243 --> 21:18.111
Another complaint
the car was still here.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.113
I came to ticket and tow.
And I smelled it.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.049
Why didn't you glove up?
You knew what it was.

21:22.049 --> 21:23.583
I should have.
I know, I fucked up,
all right?

21:23.583 --> 21:26.887
Yeah, you did.
You also trampled
all over my crime scene.

21:26.887 --> 21:28.721
SID's gonna have to photo
and print your boots.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.858
I oughta make you take 'em off
and give 'em to me right now.

21:30.858 --> 21:33.160
You want me to unlace 'em?
You just say the word,
detective.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.727
Work the perimeter.
Take the crime scene log.

21:34.727 --> 21:39.232
- Think you can do that?
- Yeah, I think I can do that.

21:39.232 --> 21:40.533
Those six months really
mellowed you out, Harry.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.502
There's a limit to what
you can let slide.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.137
Even these days.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.106
The Neanderthal
who called it in?

21:46.106 --> 21:47.774
You mean Officer Powers?

21:47.774 --> 21:49.877
We're gonna have to print
his shoes to eliminate him.

21:49.877 --> 21:52.545
- Dipshit.
- I missed you, Harry.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.481
What I said.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.649
We have footprints
leading away from
the driver's side.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.119
We have tire tracks
from a second vehicle.

21:59.119 --> 22:01.121
No blood.
Dollars to doughnuts,

22:01.121 --> 22:03.756
killed somewhere else,
dumped in his trunk,
and driven here.

22:03.756 --> 22:07.360
Look at you. You're getting
a feel for this homicide
thing, Lieutenant.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.462
- Might just work out for you.
- Bosch.

22:09.462 --> 22:12.165
- Why didn't you call me?
- That's on the watch commander.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.501
Lieutenant?
Is this how it's gonna be?

22:14.501 --> 22:17.270
Detective Ferras?
Go find some uniforms

22:17.270 --> 22:19.907
and walk the shoulders
a mile in each direction.

22:19.907 --> 22:22.609
See if the bad guys tossed
anything on their way
outta Dodge.

22:22.609 --> 22:25.913
Take Officer Powers with you.

22:25.913 --> 22:27.547
You can make an effort,
you know.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.082
He's the one with the chip
on his shoulder.

22:29.082 --> 22:30.817
I'm gonna find him
a new partner.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.452
- You're back with Edgar.
- Hey.

22:32.452 --> 22:35.255
- Don't I get a say in this?
- Fuck you.

22:35.255 --> 22:37.824
Where's Kiz?
I haven't seen her.
Is she on vacation?

22:37.824 --> 22:39.659
She transferred
two months ago.

22:39.659 --> 22:42.495
Pacific Division.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.097
How long? Ballpark?

22:44.097 --> 22:47.067
Based on the condition
of the body?

22:47.067 --> 22:48.936
Three days, maybe.

22:48.936 --> 22:50.938
Sometime Saturday night?

22:50.938 --> 22:53.540
It's been warm,
so the decomp's intense.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.575
- Oh!
- What a pussy.

22:55.575 --> 22:58.345
Smell is particulate.
You know that, right,
Lieutenant?

22:58.345 --> 23:00.113
That's pure rotten
dead guy we're breathing.

23:00.113 --> 23:03.183
All yours, gentlemen.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.658
No obvious exit wounds.

23:11.658 --> 23:12.960
Small caliber, probably.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.461
His wallet.

23:22.202 --> 23:23.971
Hotel bill.
Anthony Allen.

23:23.971 --> 23:27.107
Spent the week in Vegas
at the Mirage,

23:27.107 --> 23:28.741
checked out
this past Saturday.

23:28.741 --> 23:31.411
They comped his room.
Hit the minibar pretty hard.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.813
- Valet parking.
- So he had a car.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.648
This one or a rental.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.822
Looks like five,
six hundred bucks here.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.457
That's a legit Rolex.

23:44.457 --> 23:45.993
Ain't no knock off, brother,
that's the real deal.

23:45.993 --> 23:50.863
Scares me you know that.

23:50.863 --> 23:54.067
Fancy address.
Hidden Highlands.

23:57.837 --> 24:01.574
Car's leased to Anthony Allen,
El Presidente, TNA Productions.

24:01.574 --> 24:04.211
- Cahuenga Boulevard.
- TNA Productions?

24:04.211 --> 24:06.113
- It's porn.
- We don't know that.

24:06.113 --> 24:08.015
Could be his initials.
Tony N. Allen?

24:08.015 --> 24:09.482
What's the N stand for?
Nookie?

24:09.482 --> 24:12.252
I'll call the dealer,

24:12.252 --> 24:14.187
see if it has
a GPS tracker on it.

24:14.187 --> 24:16.256
These high end leases,
they like to keep tabs.

24:16.256 --> 24:19.492
Classic mob hit, Harry.
Small caliber, no robbery,

24:19.492 --> 24:21.694
victim's body in the trunk
of his own car.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.230
Plus porno.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.567
Let's not jump
to conclusions.

24:27.567 --> 24:30.337
Bottle of Maker's Mark.
It's a double tap twenty-two.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.442
Young lady,
when you inventory the wallet,

24:35.442 --> 24:39.379
I'm gonna need copies
of that snap.

24:39.379 --> 24:40.413
Okay.

24:40.413 --> 24:43.250
- Did you find his phone?
- Nope.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.452
- Thanks.
- Smells like O.C. to me.

24:45.452 --> 24:47.787
- Trunk music.
- Trunk music, exactly.

24:47.787 --> 24:52.492
I'll reach out to Vice.
See if they got anything on him.

24:52.492 --> 24:56.063
Divide and conquer.
I'll call my guy
at Major Crimes.

24:58.065 --> 25:01.601
- Okay, thanks.
- Anything from O.C.?

25:01.601 --> 25:04.371
- They told me to call Vice.
- I'm on hold with Vice.

25:04.371 --> 25:06.073
- Detective?
- Hold up.

25:06.073 --> 25:07.507
Yeah?

25:07.507 --> 25:08.941
Anthony Allen
is a pornographer.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.310
TNA Productions.

25:10.310 --> 25:12.145
We thought he might be.
Mobbed up?

25:12.145 --> 25:13.546
We don't have anything
on that.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.082
Have you called Major Crimes?

25:15.082 --> 25:17.284
They said to call you.
Anything else?

25:17.284 --> 25:19.319
He shoots his movies
outside L.A.County

25:19.319 --> 25:21.154
so his performers don't have
to use condoms.

25:21.154 --> 25:22.689
Good to know.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.457
You might call
the Health Department.

25:24.457 --> 25:26.093
They might have
an extensive file on this guy.

25:26.093 --> 25:27.727
- Okay. Thanks.
- LAPD.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.529
One hand doesn't know what
the other hand's doing.

25:29.529 --> 25:32.232
Welcome to my world.
When you're finished here,

25:32.232 --> 25:33.766
go notify
the next of kin.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.302
- Do we know who that is, yet?
- Veronica Allen.

25:35.302 --> 25:37.270
- The widow.
- All right.

25:37.270 --> 25:39.706
I'll send Crate and Barrel
to get a search warrant
for the offices.

25:39.706 --> 25:42.775
They'll meet you there
once you've talked
to Mrs. Allen.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.744
Time to feed the beast.

26:12.572 --> 26:15.542
That is pretty.
What is it?

26:15.542 --> 26:19.579
Oh, I don't know.
Just musing.

26:21.013 --> 26:24.217
How'd your lunch go yesterday?

26:24.217 --> 26:26.319
Lunch was civil.
On the surface.

26:26.319 --> 26:28.555
- When do you go public?
- Sunday.

26:28.555 --> 26:30.857
- Greater Page Temple.
- Oh.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.459
You and Reverend Ott.

26:32.459 --> 26:34.227
Matching black bookends.

26:34.227 --> 26:35.528
Good optics,
so I'm told.

26:35.528 --> 26:37.730
- You're invited, too.
- Oh.

26:37.730 --> 26:40.066
Well, I was looking for an
excuse to get a new Sunday
go to meeting hat.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.403
Well, this would be it.

26:43.403 --> 26:45.705
And the Mayor
and Chief Tenzer?

26:45.705 --> 26:48.641
Publicly disappointed.
Privately pissed.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.178
- Will they retaliate?
- If they win.

26:51.178 --> 26:53.513
And if O'Shea wins?

26:53.513 --> 26:56.283
He'll either bury
the Grand Jury report,

26:56.283 --> 26:57.517
or use it to bury me.

26:57.517 --> 27:00.620
- You have the video.
- He'll be Mayor.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.323
And after his Grand Jury
lays the blame on the LAPD.

27:03.323 --> 27:06.092
What are you hearing
from the Courthouse?

27:06.092 --> 27:10.062
- Not a damn thing.
- I thought you had a source.

27:10.062 --> 27:13.366
It dried up.
I don't even know if
George has testified yet.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.112
What's that for?

27:26.112 --> 27:28.515
I've been meaning
to thank you.

27:28.515 --> 27:30.217
For getting our son
off the street.

27:30.217 --> 27:32.485
Command track
is where he belongs.

27:32.485 --> 27:36.789
Yeah, following in
his father's footsteps.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.226
I like that.

27:39.226 --> 27:42.362
And I sleep better
at night.

27:46.399 --> 27:47.834
**

27:51.037 --> 27:52.572
**

28:00.880 --> 28:03.950
- Happy hour.
- Happy happy hour.

28:05.252 --> 28:07.520
Extra happy hour.

28:08.955 --> 28:11.824
- You want another?
- No, I'm good.

28:11.824 --> 28:15.262
Well, I'm gonna have one.
Hey, sweetheart.

28:15.262 --> 28:17.096
One more of these?

28:17.096 --> 28:19.266
And the check.

28:41.321 --> 28:43.290
Oh, oh, that's good.

28:43.290 --> 28:45.592
Just like that.

28:45.592 --> 28:47.894
- Oh, yeah. Just like that.
- Makin' memories.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.696
Uh, huh. I think this one's
gonna be this year's
Christmas card.

28:49.696 --> 28:52.299
- What the fuck? Who are you?
- LAPD.

28:52.299 --> 28:54.334
Oh, God.
Oh, no.

28:54.334 --> 28:56.503
This is the part where
you can get dressed,
Yum-Yum.

28:56.503 --> 28:58.471
- Thank you very much.
- Anytime.

28:58.471 --> 28:59.939
- Oh, shit.
- Sorry, baby.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.174
Fuck.

29:02.174 --> 29:06.313
Oh, shit.
Timothy Jackson.

29:06.313 --> 29:08.415
Alta Avenue.
Santa Monica?

29:08.415 --> 29:10.750
- You gonna arrest me?
- We should.

29:10.750 --> 29:14.754
- How much do you want?
- That just upped the ante.

29:14.754 --> 29:18.157
With the Solicitation
and now the Bribery?

29:18.157 --> 29:20.493
We just went from
a misdemeanor to a felony
right there.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.695
Yeah, maybe
we call your wife.

29:22.695 --> 29:24.163
Get her email,
we can send her these.

29:24.163 --> 29:26.165
How much, God damn it?

29:26.165 --> 29:29.101
- How much has he got in there?
- Look like five brand-new
Benjamins.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.103
Take it.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.872
Oh, we will.
Thank you.

29:32.872 --> 29:36.476
I'm also thinking some sort
of like monthly storage fee.

29:36.476 --> 29:38.545
- Storage fee?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

29:38.545 --> 29:40.713
To protect these babies?
You know, up there
in the cloud.

29:40.713 --> 29:43.082
That is a smart move.
You always gotta back
up your pics.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.751
- See you soon, Sugar.
- Stay out of trouble.

29:44.751 --> 29:47.354
- Why do you need that?
- Insurance.

29:47.354 --> 29:49.789
Case you get to thinking
about filing a complaint.

29:49.789 --> 29:51.658
- I won't.
- We know.

29:51.658 --> 29:53.926
Have a nice day, sir.

30:01.768 --> 30:03.670
- Here.
- I'm gonna hit the head.

30:03.670 --> 30:04.837
All right.
I'm gonna pull the car around.

30:04.837 --> 30:06.773
All right.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.343
Yeah.

30:10.343 --> 30:12.379
No, he did good.

30:12.379 --> 30:14.381
Yeah. Didn't flinch.

30:41.508 --> 30:43.810
Spends the week in Vegas.

30:43.810 --> 30:46.746
Checks out of
his hotel Saturday.

30:46.746 --> 30:49.982
Drives
or flies back to L.A.

30:49.982 --> 30:52.251
Is killed Saturday night.

30:52.251 --> 30:53.720
Maybe he was killed in Vegas.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.522
They drove him back to L.A.?

30:55.522 --> 30:57.724
Yeah, the killers.
In the trunk of his own car.

30:57.724 --> 31:00.427
- Why would they do that?
- Keep the body out of Vegas.

31:00.427 --> 31:03.496
To have it investigated
by a couple of dumbass
LA homicide detectives

31:03.496 --> 31:07.233
instead of some
razor sharp Vegas dicks.

31:07.233 --> 31:09.969
Shit, I don't know, Harry,
I'm just running through
some permutations.

31:09.969 --> 31:13.139
Here's another.
Where's his luggage?

31:13.139 --> 31:16.809
- Week in Vegas.
Oughta have luggage.
- Killers stole it.

31:16.809 --> 31:19.178
So they stole his dirty laundry
and left his wallet and Rolex?

31:19.178 --> 31:21.814
Okay. He stopped by his house,

31:21.814 --> 31:24.116
dropped his bags,
and went out again.

31:24.116 --> 31:28.020
- Should've stayed home.
- Yeah.

31:43.335 --> 31:46.906
- Yes, sir.
- We're here
to see Veronica Allen.

31:46.906 --> 31:48.274
Everything okay?

31:48.274 --> 31:51.744
Just let her know we're here,
will you, Mr. Nash.

31:51.744 --> 31:54.881
Detective Nash.
I was on the job.

31:54.881 --> 31:57.784
I thought
you looked familiar.

31:57.784 --> 31:59.151
You, too.
Bosch, right?

31:59.151 --> 32:00.286
- Yeah.
- Carl Nash.

32:00.286 --> 32:02.121
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I remember you.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.923
This is my partner,
Jerry Edgar.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.726
- Van Nuys, mostly.
- I talked to you about a case.

32:06.726 --> 32:08.695
- That family from Sherman Oaks.
- Right.

32:08.695 --> 32:10.062
- Yeah.
- You in charge here?

32:10.062 --> 32:12.031
Yeah, I run security
for the property.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.133
I got a couple
LAPD guys on staff.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.868
- Retired?
- Some.

32:15.868 --> 32:17.970
Some moonlighters.
It's a state of the art set-up.

32:17.970 --> 32:21.173
Cameras everywhere,
total coverage.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.242
Remote control.
You can punch in on a pimple.

32:23.242 --> 32:26.078
- You know rich people.
- No, I don't.

32:26.078 --> 32:28.414
Hey, can you make that
call for me?

32:28.414 --> 32:30.683
Yeah, let me do that.

32:30.683 --> 32:32.151
I'm gonna have
to escort you up.

32:32.151 --> 32:35.988
Company policy.
You can follow me. Yeah?
All right.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.089
Hey.

32:37.089 --> 32:39.592
Have you seen
Tony Allen recently?

32:39.592 --> 32:44.096
Been awhile.
Week before last?

32:44.096 --> 32:46.098
- He's out of town a lot.
- How about last Saturday night?

32:46.098 --> 32:49.435
- I was off.
- Check the tapes?

32:49.435 --> 32:50.903
They're not tapes anymore.

32:50.903 --> 32:53.540
I could.
But if you had a warrant.

32:53.540 --> 32:54.807
Let me make that call.

32:56.776 --> 33:00.179
Whatever happened
to professional courtesy?

33:06.619 --> 33:08.254
Cameras everywhere.

33:08.254 --> 33:11.323
I'll bet they got cameras
on the damn birds.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.561
- What're they so afraid of?
- Beats me.

33:14.561 --> 33:16.395
Maybe losing what they got?

33:16.395 --> 33:19.999
So this guy was Homicide?
How'd he end up here?

33:19.999 --> 33:23.970
Got jammed up by IA,
on some petty bullshit.

33:23.970 --> 33:27.006
Had to resign.
Went from working murders

33:27.006 --> 33:28.941
to working the gate
for a bunch of rich people.

33:28.941 --> 33:30.910
Talk about
losing what you got.

33:44.023 --> 33:46.659
- Thanks, Carl.
- It's good to see you, Harry.

33:49.996 --> 33:53.900
Tony went to Las Vegas
frequently for business.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.670
Did he always drive?

33:57.670 --> 33:58.905
He didn't like to fly.

33:58.905 --> 34:01.874
Oh, who does these days?

34:01.874 --> 34:04.811
What kind of business
was your husband in?

34:04.811 --> 34:07.814
- Movie producer.
- TNA Productions?

34:07.814 --> 34:11.050
- Just like it sounds.
- Softcore?

34:11.050 --> 34:13.720
- Hard.
- Why Vegas? Why so often?

34:15.254 --> 34:16.623
Casting.

34:16.623 --> 34:18.290
He liked strippers
for his films.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.627
- Fresh faces.
- They got strippers in L.A.

34:20.627 --> 34:23.062
And he liked to gamble.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.097
Did you see him
on Saturday?

34:25.097 --> 34:26.633
I didn't even know
he was back.

34:26.633 --> 34:29.101
His plans were
always open-ended.

34:29.101 --> 34:31.370
Is it possible he might have
come by while you were out?

34:31.370 --> 34:34.473
- Dropped his bags.
- No, I was here all night. Why?

34:34.473 --> 34:36.643
I didn't find
any luggage.

34:36.643 --> 34:39.111
It must have been stolen.
He always packed a suitcase
for Vegas.

34:39.111 --> 34:42.214
- A black Tumi.
- We didn't find
his cell phone, either.

34:42.214 --> 34:43.950
- I assume he had one.
- Of course.

34:43.950 --> 34:45.785
We're gonna need that number,
pull his records.

34:45.785 --> 34:48.020
When's the last time
you spoke with him?

34:48.020 --> 34:52.058
He called mid-week to tell me
he was extending his stay.

34:52.058 --> 34:54.126
I assumed he was shacked up
with his new girlfriend.

34:54.126 --> 34:57.664
- Your husband had a girlfriend?
- Always.

34:57.664 --> 34:59.666
- One after the other.
- You have a name?

34:59.666 --> 35:01.668
Sorry. We didn't
really talk about it.

35:01.668 --> 35:03.402
How'd you know it was
a new one?

35:03.402 --> 35:06.172
He would always stay longer
when he had a new lollipop.

35:06.172 --> 35:09.075
- Until he got tired of her.
- It bother you?

35:11.443 --> 35:13.012
We've been married
a long time.

35:13.012 --> 35:14.847
The gambling.
He ever get in over his head?

35:14.847 --> 35:17.116
- Owe the wrong people money?
- No.

35:17.116 --> 35:20.119
Tony was a very cautious man.
He always knew when
to walk away.

35:20.119 --> 35:22.822
- Favorite casino?
- The Mirage.

35:22.822 --> 35:24.857
- He stay there, too?
- Mm-hmm.

35:24.857 --> 35:26.158
What about a favorite
strip club?

35:26.158 --> 35:28.160
All of them.

35:28.160 --> 35:31.397
So many strippers,
so little time.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.766
That was how we met.

35:33.766 --> 35:35.835
He was casting
his next film.

35:35.835 --> 35:37.704
I gave him a lap dance
and he fell in love.

35:39.005 --> 35:41.207
I did one porno for him.

35:41.207 --> 35:44.977
And then he married me
and took me away from all that.

35:44.977 --> 35:46.779
To this.

35:49.181 --> 35:51.050
Not exactly torn up about it.

35:51.050 --> 35:53.419
Maybe a bit too cool
about the girlfriends?

35:53.419 --> 35:54.721
Maybe a bit.

35:57.223 --> 36:00.159
- Hey, you guys done?
- For now.

36:00.159 --> 36:03.029
Still need to look at the
footage from Saturday night.

36:03.029 --> 36:05.898
- And the gate log.
- We'll make it all available.

36:05.898 --> 36:09.836
- Soon as you have the warrant.
- Can't just take a quick look
off the record?

36:09.836 --> 36:13.372
Sorry, Harry, no can do.
I'd lose my job.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.507
If I knew I'd tell you.
Like I said, I was off
that night.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.644
Understood.
We'll be back tomorrow
with a warrant.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.079
We'll have it
all ready for you.

36:20.079 --> 36:22.348
What's this
all about, anyway?

36:22.348 --> 36:25.317
Tony Allen's body was
found earlier today.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.453
He was murdered,
probably Saturday night.

36:27.453 --> 36:28.955
No shit.

36:28.955 --> 36:31.290
- And she's a suspect?
- You were a homicide detective.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.092
- You know the show.
- Right, right.

36:33.092 --> 36:36.963
Nearest and dearest,
until proven otherwise.

36:36.963 --> 36:39.766
Hey, uh, you want me
to keep an eye on her?

36:39.766 --> 36:43.435
- See who comes and goes?
- This whole state-of-the-art
setup you got,

36:43.435 --> 36:46.472
- hardly seems necessary --
- You and me, we're old school,
right?

36:46.472 --> 36:49.408
- Right.
- The camera may see more
than the naked eye,

36:49.408 --> 36:51.177
but the camera can't
interpret what it sees.

36:51.177 --> 36:53.612
- Takes a detective to do that.
- Right.

36:53.612 --> 36:56.648
Can't hurt. Thanks.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.150
Appreciate it.

36:58.150 --> 36:59.385
Nash.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.035
Have a good evening.

37:34.620 --> 37:37.256
- Maybe there isn't one.
- Maybe.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.291
Holy mackerel.
How'd you do that?

38:14.060 --> 38:17.196
I used to work in Narcotics.

38:17.196 --> 38:20.967
Call Asset Forfeiture.

38:24.937 --> 38:28.240
Right, thanks.
See you in a few.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.909
Crate and Barrel
got the warrant.

38:29.909 --> 38:31.643
They're waiting for us.

38:31.643 --> 38:35.081
Lieutenant?

38:36.448 --> 38:38.150
How much?

38:39.418 --> 38:40.419
Fuck.

38:42.421 --> 38:43.422
Counted it twice.

38:43.422 --> 38:47.293
- I'll tell him.
- What was that about?

38:47.293 --> 38:49.161
They found a shitload
of cash in Allen's car.

38:49.161 --> 38:51.297
- Secret compartment.
- What's a shitload?

38:51.297 --> 38:52.899
Two hundred and forty-five
thousand dollars.

38:52.899 --> 38:55.301
- That's a shitload.
- Yeah.

39:08.915 --> 39:10.416
Here we go.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.653
LAPD.
We're with them.

39:14.653 --> 39:17.089
There's a TNA guy standing by
if you need him.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.590
- Chechen fella.
- Chechen?

39:18.590 --> 39:21.393
- That's what he said.
- He was here, working late.

39:21.393 --> 39:24.196
- This shit is 24/7.
- Porn never sleeps.

39:24.196 --> 39:26.198
Speaking of sleep,
we'll take it from here.

39:26.198 --> 39:28.734
You are a gentleman
and a scholar.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.202
- Enjoy.
- Nu-huh.

39:48.454 --> 39:52.124
If we're lucky,
this thumb drive has the
encryption info we need.

39:52.124 --> 39:55.261
Yeah?
- CCU will be able
to access his computer.

39:55.261 --> 39:59.265
- And if we're not lucky?
- We're fucked. Harris.

40:08.407 --> 40:12.378
"Victim of the Night."
R rated.

40:12.378 --> 40:15.847
Mr. and Mrs. Allen did have
some mainstream dreams.

40:15.847 --> 40:16.983
Hard to leave
that porn money behind.

40:16.983 --> 40:18.951
For him.

40:20.619 --> 40:24.556
She just did this one
and quit.

40:24.556 --> 40:26.325
Yep, so she says.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.596
So she says.

40:41.307 --> 40:45.978
Well, look at there.

40:45.978 --> 40:47.313
That's a camera.

40:47.313 --> 40:49.348
You can see,
nothing all weekend

40:49.348 --> 40:51.450
but Mexican lady,
empties wastebasket.

40:51.450 --> 40:53.952
- Any other surveillance cameras?
- Besides the one in his office?

40:53.952 --> 40:55.954
Mr. A would not allow
other cameras.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.789
Worried about leakage.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.025
- Leakage?
- Internet.

40:59.025 --> 41:00.492
Unauthorized use material.
Piracy.

41:00.492 --> 41:02.794
Terrible.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.830
Nothing Monday.

41:04.830 --> 41:07.033
Now we are Tuesday.

41:07.033 --> 41:08.634
Now we are tonight.
This is you.

41:10.369 --> 41:12.304
Go to Saturday night.

41:12.304 --> 41:13.672
What time did you leave here
that night?

41:13.672 --> 41:16.075
Late. Eleven-thirty.
Was editing.

41:16.075 --> 41:18.044
You didn't see Mr. Allen?

41:18.044 --> 41:19.478
Told you, no.

41:19.478 --> 41:20.946
Got to Saturday night.
Eleven-thirty.

41:23.115 --> 41:25.051
Wait. Stop. Go back.

41:27.286 --> 41:29.221
Play it real time from there.

41:36.195 --> 41:40.466
Holy shit.
They're debugging the place.

41:40.466 --> 41:42.434
Okay, stop.

41:42.434 --> 41:44.803
Zoom in?

41:44.803 --> 41:47.073
- See the time stamp?
- Mm-hmm. Four-fifteen,
Sunday morning.

41:47.073 --> 41:49.275
- That's the wee hours.
- Let it play.

41:52.244 --> 41:55.314
Pros. In and out
in under a minute.

41:55.314 --> 41:57.783
Allen's murdered
sometime Saturday night.

41:57.783 --> 42:00.952
Four a.m. Sunday,
somebody sweeps his office?

42:00.952 --> 42:02.821
Maybe there's video
in other buildings.

42:02.821 --> 42:05.157
Let's check the streets.
