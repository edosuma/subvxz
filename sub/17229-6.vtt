WELL, SOME
HEARTLESS CORPORATIONS

19:46.602 --> 19:48.671
CUT THEIR EMPLOYEES'
SALARIES.

19:52.541 --> 19:53.976
ALBERTO...

19:53.976 --> 19:56.912
HMM?

19:56.912 --> 19:58.914
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOU BUSTED MY BUTT

19:58.914 --> 20:00.282
ABOUT DANIELA'S SALARY?

20:00.282 --> 20:01.417
AH, THE DAY
YOU BECAME A CHICK.

20:01.417 --> 20:02.451
[ CHUCKLES ]

20:02.451 --> 20:06.388
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CUT
YOUR SALARY BY $51 A WEEK.

20:06.388 --> 20:08.757
TO DO THE SAME JOB
I WAS DOING TWO DAYS AGO?

20:08.757 --> 20:11.860
[ CHUCKLES ]
WHO'S THE WOMAN NOW, ALBERTO?

20:17.232 --> 20:18.233
THAT WAS
VERY NICE OF YOU, CRIS.

20:18.233 --> 20:19.735
I'M A NICE PERSON.

20:21.270 --> 20:25.240
WHO IS SOMETIMES WRONG
AND HAS TO CLEAN THINGS UP.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.543
THE THING IS, I...

20:27.543 --> 20:31.280
I ACTUALLY MAKE MORE
THAN $50 A WEEK MORE THAN FELIX.

20:31.280 --> 20:32.848
I KNOW.

20:33.949 --> 20:35.818
I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE FELIX FEEL BETTER.

20:35.818 --> 20:40.823
OH, LYING TO A MAN
TO MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.559
YOU MIGHT BE GOOD
AT MARRIAGE ONE DAY.

20:43.559 --> 20:48.530
I'M GONNA WEAR A VEST
TO MY WEDDING.
