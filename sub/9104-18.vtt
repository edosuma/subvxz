00:37.800 --> 00:40.240
<i>&lrm;Let's give it up</i>
<i>&lrm;for our next contestant,</i>

00:40.360 --> 00:41.280
&lrm;Nino!

00:42.440 --> 00:43.760
&lrm;[chuckling]

00:44.920 --> 00:48.320
<i>&lrm;So, Nino, you're a student</i>
<i>&lrm;and a DJ, pretty awesome.</i>

00:48.480 --> 00:50.320
<i>&lrm;Check out the decks</i>
<i>&lrm;we've got for you.</i>

00:50.680 --> 00:51.920
&lrm;Grounded? For what?

00:52.400 --> 00:54.160
&lrm;Let's jog your memory.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.400
&lrm;Monday morning,

00:55.520 --> 00:56.560
&lrm;absent from PE.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.120
&lrm;[she giggles]

01:00.520 --> 01:01.800
&lrm;I was in study hall.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.680
&lrm;Friday evening,
&lrm;absent from study hall.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.120
&lrm;[worried sigh]

01:07.280 --> 01:08.520
&lrm;[meowing]

01:08.800 --> 01:10.360
&lrm;I was at PE.

01:10.520 --> 01:12.680
&lrm;You're never where
&lrm;you're supposed to be.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.000
&lrm;The only to keep track of you
&lrm;is by grounding you.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.960
&lrm;But I was invited.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.400
&lrm;Nino's my friend.
&lrm;He was counting on me.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.640
<i>&lrm;So the challenge</i>
<i>&lrm;our viewers have chosen is...</i>

01:23.760 --> 01:27.920
<i>&lrm;to get the mayor of Paris,</i>
<i>&lrm;Andre Bourgeois to dance!</i>

01:28.320 --> 01:30.440
<i>&lrm;Thank you for agreeing</i>
<i>&lrm;to play with us.</i>

01:30.600 --> 01:31.640
<i>&lrm;What are Nino's chances?</i>

01:32.200 --> 01:33.760
<i>&lrm;Zero, I despise dancing.</i>

01:33.920 --> 01:37.320
<i>&lrm;The last time I danced,</i>
<i>&lrm;Madonna was in kindergarten.</i>

01:37.440 --> 01:39.040
&lrm;I know Nino's your friend

01:39.200 --> 01:42.080
&lrm;but until your unexcused absences
&lrm;come to an end,

01:42.240 --> 01:43.720
&lrm;that's the way it is.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.920
&lrm;Awesome.

01:46.080 --> 01:51.480
&lrm;[mysterious music]

01:51.800 --> 01:52.960
&lrm;[frustrated groan]

01:53.120 --> 01:54.280
&lrm;Can you blame them?

01:54.440 --> 01:57.520
&lrm;How are they supposed to know
&lrm;you miss class to save the world?

01:58.040 --> 02:01.920
&lrm;I guess being grounded comes
&lrm;with being a top-secret superhero.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.320
&lrm;It doesn't seem fair.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.600
&lrm;It's not.
&lrm;But hey, if Nino wins,

02:05.760 --> 02:08.720
&lrm;you're not grounded next week,
&lrm;you can go then.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.160
&lrm;Yeah, but Adrien was there today.

02:15.440 --> 02:16.880
&lrm;A challenge...

02:17.000 --> 02:18.800
&lrm;What an interesting concept.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.320
&lrm;A TV show with such potential
&lrm;for negative emotion.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.200
&lrm;Oh, the destructive mayhem
&lrm;we could cause.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.960
&lrm;Seriously? How can you say that?

02:30.120 --> 02:32.040
<i>&lrm;Sorry, but I get your dad.</i>

02:32.160 --> 02:36.240
<i>&lrm;You're never where you say,</i>
<i>&lrm;being late, splitting mysteriously.</i>

02:36.400 --> 02:39.120
<i>&lrm;I'd expect you to be leading...</i>
<i>&lrm;a double life.</i>

02:40.320 --> 02:42.600
&lrm;Gimme a break,
&lrm;you're being ridiculous.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.320
&lrm;Just wait here.

02:44.440 --> 02:45.520
&lrm;Thanks.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.080
&lrm;[trendy music]

02:48.240 --> 02:49.560
&lrm;No, it's OK.

02:49.680 --> 02:53.400
&lrm;[trendy music]

02:53.560 --> 02:55.200
<i>&lrm;Victory!</i>

02:55.320 --> 02:56.760
<i>&lrm;Challenge conquered by Nino.</i>

02:56.920 --> 02:59.320
<i>&lrm;You moved to the beat Major,</i>
<i>&lrm;that counts as dancing.</i>

02:59.440 --> 03:02.040
<i>&lrm;What? That's not true.</i>

03:02.200 --> 03:04.320
<i>&lrm;My neck was itching, that's all.</i>

03:04.440 --> 03:06.960
<i>&lrm;Relieving an itch to the beat</i>
<i>&lrm;counts as dancing too.</i>

03:07.400 --> 03:09.160
<i>&lrm;Nino, congratulations.</i>

03:09.320 --> 03:12.280
<i>&lrm;You'll return in one week</i>
<i>&lrm;for your next challenge.</i>

03:12.440 --> 03:15.840
<i>&lrm;And now for our next contestant,</i>
<i>&lrm;welcome Simon Grimault.</i>

03:17.560 --> 03:18.560
&lrm;Awesome, dude.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.640
&lrm;[Alec] Mr. Grimault,

03:19.760 --> 03:20.960
<i>&lrm;You're a hypnotist,</i>

03:21.120 --> 03:24.120
<i>&lrm;You hypnotise people</i>
<i>&lrm;to get what you want.</i>

03:24.240 --> 03:26.360
<i>&lrm;Well... yes,</i>
<i>&lrm;I'm a hypnotist but</i>

03:26.520 --> 03:29.080
<i>&lrm;I don't use my skills</i>
<i>&lrm;to get anything.</i>

03:29.520 --> 03:32.280
<i>&lrm;So, your challenge</i>
<i>&lrm;is to use your talents</i>

03:32.440 --> 03:35.320
<i>&lrm;to bring a very elusive celebrity</i>
<i>&lrm;to our TV set.</i>

03:35.920 --> 03:39.000
<i>&lrm;Give it for the King of Fashion</i>
<i>&lrm;Gabriel Agreste.</i>

03:39.480 --> 03:42.640
<i>&lrm;What is this show?</i>
<i>&lrm;I was told this was an interview.</i>

03:42.760 --> 03:44.240
&lrm;Dude, your dad.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.360
&lrm;[Alec] Do your thing,

03:46.040 --> 03:49.600
<i>&lrm;Let's see if you can bring</i>
<i>&lrm;Mr. Agreste here with your powers.</i>

03:49.720 --> 03:51.640
<i>&lrm;I told you,</i>
<i>&lrm;I don't make p...</i>

03:51.760 --> 03:53.320
<i>&lrm;A shy hypnotist.</i>

03:53.480 --> 03:55.160
<i>&lrm;How funny is that, Gabriel?</i>

03:55.280 --> 03:57.600
<i>&lrm;Hilarious, your show is pathetic.</i>

03:57.760 --> 03:59.520
<i>&lrm;And so is your contestant.</i>

03:59.680 --> 04:01.040
<i>&lrm;Control me? Never.</i>

04:02.120 --> 04:03.640
&lrm;That's my dad alright.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.760
<i>&lrm;Looks like Mr. Agreste</i>
<i>&lrm;turned down your challenge.</i>

04:06.920 --> 04:08.040
<i>&lrm;Game over.</i>

04:08.160 --> 04:11.640
<i>&lrm;But... that's not fair.</i>
<i>&lrm;I didn't even get time to...</i>

04:13.440 --> 04:17.519
&lrm;[mysterious music]
&lrm;[sighing]

04:18.279 --> 04:19.399
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Yes...

04:19.519 --> 04:21.399
&lrm;humiliation and anger...

04:21.519 --> 04:24.560
&lrm;the perfect elements
&lrm;for transforming a loser

04:24.680 --> 04:26.000
&lrm;into a winner.

04:26.320 --> 04:28.800
&lrm;[mysterious music]

04:32.960 --> 04:35.840
&lrm;Fly away, my little Akuma,
&lrm;and evilise him!

&lrm;[dramatic music]

04:44.520 --> 04:46.280
&lrm;I am Hawk Moth,

04:47.000 --> 04:49.360
&lrm;you are now Simon Says.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.880
&lrm;I will help you to be
&lrm;the most powerful hypnotist ever.

04:53.040 --> 04:56.000
&lrm;You will help me in return
&lrm;when the time's right.

04:56.160 --> 04:58.560
&lrm;So, do we have a deal, Simon Says?

04:58.720 --> 05:01.400
&lrm;[evil voice] Simon Says "yes".

05:04.080 --> 05:05.160
&lrm;[gasping]

05:05.320 --> 05:07.840
&lrm;Simon Says the show is not over.

05:07.960 --> 05:08.720
&lrm;What the...?

05:09.160 --> 05:10.200
&lrm;Silence!

05:10.360 --> 05:12.320
&lrm;Simon Says you're lame,

05:12.480 --> 05:13.960
&lrm;as lame as a duck.

05:14.680 --> 05:16.160

05:19.640 --> 05:20.560
&lrm;[growling]

05:20.680 --> 05:22.640
&lrm;Simon Says stop!

05:24.040 --> 05:26.880
&lrm;Simon Says you are a gorilla.

&lrm;Marinette, look!

05:40.280 --> 05:41.920
&lrm;I've gotta go, Alya.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.880
<i>&lrm;Have a good one.</i>
<i>&lrm;I'll get back to babysitting.</i>

05:45.280 --> 05:47.520
&lrm;Tikki, what can I do? I'm grounded.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.160
&lrm;You have no choice,
&lrm;you must transform.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.960
&lrm;We have to be extra-careful.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.040
&lrm;Use that pillow

05:54.160 --> 05:55.280
&lrm;under your sheets.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.880
&lrm;[Tikki] Lookin' good.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.320
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

<i>&lrm;By midnight tonight,</i>
<i>&lrm;he will entertain us</i>

06:34.880 --> 06:36.440
<i>&lrm;in this very TV studio.</i>

06:36.600 --> 06:38.800
&lrm;Gabriel, I'm coming to get you!

06:39.080 --> 06:39.880
&lrm;Dad?

06:40.360 --> 06:42.880
&lrm;It's risky, but it's given me an idea.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.280
&lrm;Good luck, Simon Says.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.320
&lrm;[he gasps]

&lrm;My gorilla will take care of you.
&lrm;Simon Says

07:00.560 --> 07:01.480
&lrm;knock him out.

&lrm;[groaning]

07:07.840 --> 07:10.840
&lrm;I may not always land of my feet
&lrm;but I always bounce back.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.240
&lrm;I could use an army.

07:25.240 --> 07:28.400
&lrm;[screaming]

07:30.120 --> 07:35.480
&lrm;Simon Says search all over Paris
&lrm;and find Gabriel Agreste.

&lrm;Hey, you OK?

07:55.520 --> 07:57.800
&lrm;I'm fine but my boy Adrien
&lrm;is still here.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.680
&lrm;Don't worry, we'll find him.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.560
&lrm;I quit karate.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.440
&lrm;[lift beeps]

08:30.240 --> 08:32.120
&lrm;Nice seeing you too, Cat Noir.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.320
&lrm;Sorry. I thought
&lrm;you were Simon Says.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.559
&lrm;I saw him.
&lrm;He's got a whole army.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.799
&lrm;[Cat Noir] He's looking

08:37.919 --> 08:38.760
&lrm;for Gabriel Agreste.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.159
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;We'd better get to him fast.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.679
&lrm;You're about to change back.
&lrm;I'll have a look

08:43.799 --> 08:44.880
&lrm;[Ladybug] for Nino's friend.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.760
&lrm;Forget it. He's probably hypnotised.

08:46.880 --> 08:47.760
&lrm;But he's my buddy.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.360
&lrm;You're right. Maybe he's hiding.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.000
&lrm;I'll leave you to look for him.
&lrm;Let's meet

08:53.120 --> 08:54.640
&lrm;at Gabriel Agreste's place.

08:55.200 --> 08:56.080
&lrm;[confused sighs]

08:56.560 --> 08:58.720
&lrm;Finding Adrien will be a piece of cake.

&lrm;[whooshing]

09:01.360 --> 09:02.560

09:06.080 --> 09:06.800
&lrm;Nino.

&lrm;Adrien!

09:10.840 --> 09:11.960
&lrm;Dude, you OK?

09:12.120 --> 09:13.240
&lrm;I'm fine.

09:14.800 --> 09:15.880
&lrm;[nervously] Hello.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.520
&lrm;[nervous stuttering]
&lrm;H-H-Hello.

09:18.680 --> 09:19.840
&lrm;You sure you're OK.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.160
&lrm;I'm fine, really.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.640
&lrm;But we must get to my house
&lrm;my father's in danger.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.480
&lrm;Let's go.
&lrm;Cat Noir will meet us there.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.120
&lrm;Nathalie, where's father?
&lrm;He's in danger.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.440
&lrm;He knows already.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.160
&lrm;Good evening, Ladybug.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.080
&lrm;Father, you've gotta get out of here.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.720
&lrm;Simon Says is coming after you.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.880
&lrm;What? And be dictated
&lrm;by a madman? Certainly not.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.440
&lrm;But he's dangerous.
&lrm;Who knows what he'll do?

09:47.560 --> 09:48.720
&lrm;Go up to your room.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.920
&lrm;You've had enough excitement for today.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.160
&lrm;Nathalie, make sure they stay there.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.240
&lrm;I have to apologise for my son.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.320
&lrm;He's like his mother,
&lrm;too overly dramatic.

09:58.440 --> 09:59.880
&lrm;But he's right.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.680
&lrm;Simon Says is a real threat.
&lrm;You're in danger.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.840
&lrm;What could possibly happen to me

10:04.960 --> 10:06.200
&lrm;with you here to protect me?

10:06.720 --> 10:08.840
&lrm;You sure your old man isn't a robot?

10:08.960 --> 10:11.200
&lrm;Where my father is concerned
&lrm;I'm never sure.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.320
&lrm;[gasping]

10:15.480 --> 10:18.320
&lrm;Dude, I've seen stadiums
&lrm;tinier than your room.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.320
&lrm;Make yourself at home.
&lrm;I'll take a shower.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.240
&lrm;Now?

10:21.360 --> 10:23.640
&lrm;What can I say?
&lrm;It's the model in me.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.160
&lrm;Why doesn't my father listen to me?

10:28.280 --> 10:29.960
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

10:31.160 --> 10:35.040
&lrm;[lively music]

10:46.160 --> 10:48.200
&lrm;[panting]

10:49.240 --> 10:51.520
&lrm;[dreamy music]

10:51.640 --> 10:53.120
&lrm;Isn't he flawless?

10:53.240 --> 10:55.200
&lrm;[nervously] Wh-What? Flaw what?

10:55.320 --> 10:56.560
&lrm;Adrien, my son.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.760
&lrm;He's the image of perfection, isn't he?

10:59.480 --> 11:01.440
&lrm;[in admiration] Yes, he's perfect.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.320
&lrm;I mean... I don't know him but he seems...

11:04.440 --> 11:07.040
&lrm;I've never noticed your earrings before.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.680
&lrm;They are quite unique.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.400
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;May I?

11:10.560 --> 11:11.640
&lrm;Excuse me.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.200
&lrm;Cat Noir, where were you?

11:14.320 --> 11:17.080
&lrm;I was keeping Simon Says at bay.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.320
&lrm;[he gasps]
&lrm;And?

11:18.440 --> 11:19.160
&lrm;[groaning]

11:19.320 --> 11:20.120
<i>&lrm;Cat Noir,</i>

11:20.240 --> 11:23.480
&lrm;I couldn't keep him away.
&lrm;He's coming. He's got company.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.040
&lrm;[moaning]

11:26.600 --> 11:27.760
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;Close all exits.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.800
&lrm;They're coming from everywhere.

11:29.920 --> 11:32.720
&lrm;Engage the defence system,
&lrm;total lockdown.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.080
&lrm;[bleeping]

11:36.880 --> 11:38.320
&lrm;[bleeping]
<i>&lrm;Lockdown engaged.</i>

11:38.840 --> 11:41.760
&lrm;[whirring]

11:42.480 --> 11:44.160
&lrm;How do you know about the system?

11:44.320 --> 11:46.960
&lrm;In a house like this it's a given.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.000
&lrm;They won't get in.
&lrm;This house is a fortress.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.560
&lrm;[moaning]

11:54.160 --> 11:56.240
&lrm;Simon Says destroy.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.160
&lrm;[gasping]

11:59.320 --> 12:01.760
&lrm;[roaring]

12:03.720 --> 12:04.520
&lrm;[shouting]

12:04.640 --> 12:07.800
&lrm;[alarm rings]
<i>&lrm;Emergency power on.</i>

12:07.960 --> 12:10.480
&lrm;There are too many of them.
&lrm;Your defence system is failing.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.320
&lrm;Adrien and Nino...
&lrm;I'd better go get them

12:13.880 --> 12:15.080
&lrm;Nathalie, take the controls

12:15.200 --> 12:16.760
&lrm;to unlock any exits.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.440
&lrm;She's coming with you.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.400
&lrm;I'll reinforce the defences.

12:20.560 --> 12:22.480
&lrm;Hide in the atrium.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.840
&lrm;No-one tells me what to do,
&lrm;not even you.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.160
&lrm;You're in danger.

12:27.320 --> 12:29.640
&lrm;Just do as I tell you to.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.720
&lrm;[gasping]

12:32.960 --> 12:35.400
&lrm;Quite a temper,
&lrm;you remind me of someone.

12:35.520 --> 12:40.920
&lrm;[dramatic music]

12:43.920 --> 12:45.160
&lrm;[shouting]

12:45.280 --> 12:48.040
&lrm;[cackling]

12:49.160 --> 12:51.760
&lrm;I don't think
&lrm;that's a good idea, Simon Says.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.840
&lrm;Gabriel is here!

12:53.960 --> 12:55.920
&lrm;Yes but don't forget our deal.

12:56.080 --> 12:58.840
&lrm;I feel Ladybug and Cat Noir nearby.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.560
&lrm;Once they're in front of you,
&lrm;you can honour our agreement.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.240
&lrm;Just take their jewels, the Miraculouses.

13:05.520 --> 13:08.400
&lrm;It's as good as done.
&lrm;Simon Says we'll defeat them.

13:09.080 --> 13:09.960
&lrm;[gasping]

13:10.280 --> 13:11.840
&lrm;Ladybug, What's going on?

13:11.960 --> 13:14.160
&lrm;We need to get to safety.
&lrm;Where's Adrien?

13:14.280 --> 13:16.160
&lrm;-Taking a shower.
&lrm;-Now?

13:16.320 --> 13:17.680
&lrm;It's the model in him.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.920
&lrm;Go to the atrium. I'll get Adrien.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.080
&lrm;Leave the control with me.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.520
&lrm;Adrien?

13:27.880 --> 13:29.000
&lrm;[Ladybug] Adrien?

13:31.480 --> 13:33.360
&lrm;Adrien?

13:33.480 --> 13:34.520
&lrm;Yeah?

13:35.200 --> 13:38.000
&lrm;Must...to go...

13:38.160 --> 13:39.720
&lrm;too dangerous... to leave.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.480
&lrm;Can I get dressed?

13:41.600 --> 13:43.680
&lrm;Sure... if you must.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.280
&lrm;I mean... of course you can.

13:48.400 --> 13:49.240
&lrm;[sigh of relief]

13:49.360 --> 13:50.480
&lrm;[sigh of relief]

13:51.360 --> 13:52.680
&lrm;[whimpering]

13:52.800 --> 13:53.880
&lrm;Where is my son?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.320
&lrm;He'll be here.
&lrm;He's with Ladybug.

13:56.440 --> 13:57.800
&lrm;[questioning sigh]

13:58.200 --> 13:59.880
&lrm;[mysterious music]

14:02.440 --> 14:03.480
&lrm;[door opens]

14:03.600 --> 14:06.600
&lrm;My mother. She was pretty, no?

14:07.160 --> 14:08.640
&lrm;SHE'S GOT YOUR EYES.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.440
&lrm;[they gasp]
&lrm;[they chuckle]

14:10.880 --> 14:13.280
&lrm;[shouting]

14:13.400 --> 14:14.840
&lrm;[gasping]

14:15.840 --> 14:16.880
&lrm;Stay here!

14:17.320 --> 14:18.440
&lrm;Oh my.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.520
&lrm;What was that all about?
&lrm;Sweet love?

14:22.880 --> 14:24.240
&lrm;Gotta help her.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.960
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

14:27.000 --> 14:28.440
&lrm;[squealing] Not again.

&lrm;[screens hiss]

14:30.680 --> 14:31.760
&lrm;Are they coming?

<i>&lrm;Flap, flap, flutter, flutter...</i>

&lrm;We've gotta save Mr. Agreste.

15:26.920 --> 15:30.160
<i>&lrm;Tomorrow, butterfly,</i>
<i>&lrm;you will be no more.</i>

15:30.280 --> 15:32.600
&lrm;The Akuma's gotta be in one of the cards.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.560
&lrm;But which one? There are so many.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.680
&lrm;[dramatic music]

15:36.840 --> 15:38.200
&lrm;[she yells]

15:40.320 --> 15:41.800
&lrm;Ladybug, Cat Noir,

15:41.920 --> 15:44.000
&lrm;to save him, give me your Miraculouses.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.360
&lrm;Do the right thing.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.400
&lrm;In your dreams.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.400
&lrm;Lucky charm!

15:48.560 --> 15:52.520
&lrm;[lively music]

15:53.440 --> 15:55.920
&lrm;A regular yoyo?
&lrm;But you've got a magic one.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.760
&lrm;I'll figure it out later.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.360
&lrm;[whizzing]

15:59.520 --> 16:01.760
&lrm;Simon Says your yoyo is useless.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.200
&lrm;Simon Says your stick is...

16:15.160 --> 16:16.680
&lrm;Useless? I don't think so.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.960
&lrm;I'm not gonna let you
&lrm;get a word in.

16:19.120 --> 16:23.440
&lrm;[dramatic music]

16:24.680 --> 16:25.720
&lrm;Simon Says...

&lrm;[noisy chanting]

16:27.160 --> 16:29.240
&lrm;It doesn't matter if you can hear me.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.960
&lrm;All that's important is what Simon Says.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.240
&lrm;Simon Says give me you Miraculous.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.680

16:41.960 --> 16:44.800
&lrm;Simon Says take off, little airplane.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.000
&lrm;[rasping]

16:52.160 --> 16:54.400
&lrm;He's gone to the roof.
&lrm;We have to stop him.

16:56.160 --> 16:59.160
&lrm;This is the last chance
&lrm;and I can't do it alone.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.040
&lrm;If we free Simon Says,
&lrm;we free Mr. Agreste too.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.480
&lrm;Let's not waste a minute.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.079
&lrm;How will you defeat me
&lrm;without your yoyo?

17:07.880 --> 17:10.720
&lrm;[rasping]

17:11.280 --> 17:13.920
&lrm;Simon Says... it's over.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.640
&lrm;[dramatic music]

17:18.760 --> 17:19.800
&lrm;Follow my lead.

&lrm;[fluttering]

17:43.560 --> 17:46.440
&lrm;That's not possible.
&lrm;I made your yoyo useless.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.000
&lrm;This one yes, but not that one.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.160
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

18:03.920 --> 18:04.960
&lrm;My yoyo.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.480
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.120
&lrm;[lively music]

18:11.280 --> 18:13.320
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:13.480 --> 18:16.040
&lrm;[lively music]

18:16.680 --> 18:17.520
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:18.920 --> 18:20.440
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.480

18:24.640 --> 18:25.320
&lrm;POUND IT!

18:27.440 --> 18:29.360
&lrm;Your flight's been cancelled, sir.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.520
&lrm;-You?
&lrm;-Prefer Ladybug?

18:31.680 --> 18:33.360
&lrm;[bleeping] Can't say I blame you.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.840
&lrm;Cat Noir, your ring. You'd better go.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.400
&lrm;Like a cat on a hot tin roof.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.400
&lrm;See you again soon, Mr. Agreste.

18:41.520 --> 18:47.400
&lrm;[mysterious music]

18:47.520 --> 18:49.280
&lrm;And you, milady.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.600
&lrm;[endearing sigh]

19:15.560 --> 19:16.560
&lrm;[he gasps]

19:18.840 --> 19:20.640
&lrm;I've never noticed your ring before.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.800
&lrm;That's the only thing
&lrm;you've never noticed?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.640
&lrm;I'm glad everything worked out.

19:26.760 --> 19:32.720
&lrm;[slow music continues]

19:36.880 --> 19:41.200
&lrm;[pop music]

19:41.360 --> 19:44.760
<i>&lrm;Welcome back</i>
<i>&lrm;to the No 1 game show, The Challenge.</i>

19:44.920 --> 19:47.800
<i>&lrm;Last week,</i>
<i>&lrm;our cool DJ Nino won the challenge.</i>

19:47.960 --> 19:49.920
<i>&lrm;So let's welcome him back again.</i>

19:50.760 --> 19:51.600
&lrm;Come on out,

19:51.720 --> 19:54.360
&lrm;DJ... Nino!

19:55.640 --> 19:58.160
&lrm;[pop music]

19:58.320 --> 19:59.400
&lrm;[Tom]<i>&lrm; Looks like</i>

19:59.520 --> 20:01.520
&lrm;you weren't absent or late all week.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.400
&lrm;Excellent news, Marinette.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.960
&lrm;You can go join your friends on the set.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.440
&lrm;I think I'd rather watch it with you.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.440
&lrm;That's if you and mom would like that.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.080
&lrm;[chuckling]

20:13.480 --> 20:15.920
<i>&lrm;So we've upped</i>
<i>&lrm;the challenge tonight, Nino.</i>

20:16.080 --> 20:19.200
<i>&lrm;You have to get 2 celebrities</i>
<i>&lrm;dancing instead of one.</i>

20:19.360 --> 20:22.080
<i>&lrm;But this time,</i>
<i>&lrm;you can choose your opponents.</i>

20:22.200 --> 20:24.040
<i>&lrm;I got this one in the bag.</i>

20:24.200 --> 20:27.600
<i>&lrm;I'm gonna pick two buds</i>
<i>&lrm;I know won't let me down.</i>

20:27.760 --> 20:29.680
<i>&lrm;Ladybug... and Cat Noir.</i>

20:29.800 --> 20:30.800
&lrm;[she squeals]

20:31.320 --> 20:34.600
&lrm;On second thoughts,
&lrm;I'm gonna take a nap.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.840
&lrm;Don't want to be late for school,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.280
&lrm;and mess up that perfect school record.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.560
&lrm;Tell me what happens.

20:41.560 --> 20:42.880
&lrm;-Sure.
&lrm;-Of course, honey.

20:44.520 --> 20:47.840
&lrm;Sometimes,
&lrm;I just can't figure that girl out.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.480
&lrm;Give her a break.

20:49.640 --> 20:53.000
&lrm;You know there's nothing more demanding
&lrm;than going to school.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.080
&lrm;[she chuckles]
