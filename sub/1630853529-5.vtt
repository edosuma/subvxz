00:09.844 --> 00:12.513
<i>Mm, morning, Big Head.</i>

00:12.596 --> 00:14.932
Good morning, indeed.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.684
Ey, I got to say, Cerise,

00:16.767 --> 00:20.855
last night was the best collab
of all time.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.607
- Mm, you look so fire.

00:23.691 --> 00:24.900
Let me screenshot.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.110
<i>Ooh.</i>

00:26.193 --> 00:27.862
<i>Gram me like one</i>
<i>of your old moms.</i>

00:29.363 --> 00:32.658
Yo, did homeboy
fuck his phone last night?

00:32.742 --> 00:33.701
You know what, boo?

00:33.784 --> 00:35.161
I feel so good,

00:35.244 --> 00:37.580
I think it's time
for a little morning montage.

00:37.663 --> 00:38.581
- Skrrt!
"Neighborhood"]

00:40.958 --> 00:42.460
Whoo!

00:42.543 --> 00:44.462
<i>I went Hollywood...</i>

00:44.545 --> 00:47.131
Ain't y'all supposed to be
the athletes in the fam, fam?

00:49.133 --> 00:50.384
- Tart lyfe!

00:50.468 --> 00:53.137
<i>out the neighborhood...</i>

00:53.220 --> 00:55.139
Ey, Disco!

00:55.222 --> 00:56.432
Phyly Phyl,
how we livin'?

00:58.142 --> 00:59.059
Oh, yeah.

00:59.143 --> 01:01.312
Ey, Trumanji is back, baby...

01:01.395 --> 01:03.439
Oh, my fucking God!

01:03.522 --> 01:05.024
- Fire!

01:16.994 --> 01:19.038
Ey, yo, what the fuck
just happened?

01:19.121 --> 01:20.247
I know our school is lit,

01:20.331 --> 01:22.333
but this shit
is Michelle Obama level hot.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.544
Man, I can't believe
someone torched

01:25.628 --> 01:27.171
the gender-neutral
bathroom last night.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.339
Who do you think did it?

01:28.422 --> 01:30.049
Wait, yo, yo, yo!
Check it.

01:30.132 --> 01:33.302
Unfairfactz just posted a wild
blind item about it on Insta.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.180
Damn. For real?

01:36.263 --> 01:38.599
When did Fairfax
go straight up CW in this bitch?

01:38.682 --> 01:41.310
Dawg, Unfairfactz is the
hottest new blind gossip account

01:41.393 --> 01:43.562
- on the Gram.
- Nobody knows who runs it,

01:43.646 --> 01:44.897
- but it's already the most

01:44.980 --> 01:47.233
trustworthy source
of untrustworthy tea.

01:47.316 --> 01:51.278
- Oh!
- Yo,
I knew it was him.

01:54.365 --> 01:55.574
Derica Stratton-Torres,

01:55.658 --> 01:57.076
my office. Now.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.162
Whatever it is, I'm innocent!

02:00.246 --> 02:01.664
Get out your phones,
someone go live!

02:03.249 --> 02:04.834
Let's get it trending, people.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.001
Ey, yo, Truman.

02:06.085 --> 02:07.127
Let me holler
at you right quick.

02:07.211 --> 02:08.838
P-dubs, for the last time,

02:08.921 --> 02:10.673
I'm not following you
on Spotify.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.675
Oh, th-this ain't
about all that.

02:13.759 --> 02:14.718
Now, look,

02:14.802 --> 02:16.053
due to last night's incident,

02:16.136 --> 02:18.222
we'll be having an emergency
fire safety assembly

02:18.305 --> 02:19.348
at the end of the day.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.016
Unfortunately,
the fire safety video

02:21.100 --> 02:23.310
- hasn't aged
particularly well.
- Hold up.

02:23.394 --> 02:26.063
How does fire safety age poorly?

02:26.146 --> 02:28.274
<i>Hey, little kids,</i>
<i>I'm Kevin Spacey.</i>

02:28.357 --> 02:31.151
Okay,
what about the one before that?

02:31.235 --> 02:33.529
<i>Hi, little kids,</i>
<i>I'm Woody Allen.</i>

02:33.612 --> 02:35.197
Uh, say no more, fam. We good.

02:35.281 --> 02:39.076
That's why I need you to make me
a fire fire safety video.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.703
Ooh, I'm honored, Weston,

02:40.786 --> 02:43.289
but I'll need my gang gang,
full franchise rights

02:43.372 --> 02:45.124
and a red carpet premiere
before the assembly.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.876
- Deal.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.800
All right,
now one for Westy's feed.

02:54.884 --> 02:56.886
Everybody say "guilty."

02:56.969 --> 02:58.095
Guilty of what?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.930
That's the
million-dollar question.

03:00.014 --> 03:03.601
One of y'all is a murderer...

03:04.810 --> 03:06.395
...of my reputation.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.105
- Are you serious?
- Girl, please.
- This is slander.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.357
The rebel.

03:10.441 --> 03:11.442
Whoops.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.193
That's me and the missus
in Cabo.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.653
The rebel.

03:14.737 --> 03:16.864
The drama queen.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.407
Cody's girlfriend.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.659
And the new girl.

03:20.743 --> 03:22.912
Y'all were the last four kids
at the school yesterday,

03:22.995 --> 03:24.955
and Carl the janitor
placed y'all

03:25.039 --> 03:27.124
near or around
the gender-neutral bathroom

03:27.207 --> 03:30.920
at the approximate time
of the crime.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.129
- Is this a joke?
- What?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.714
I want my lawyer.

03:33.797 --> 03:37.801
I'm sorry, but I find fires
to be extremely homophobic.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.220
Stop calling things homophobic
just to confuse me,

03:40.304 --> 03:41.388
'cause it does.

03:41.472 --> 03:43.057
Damn kids giving me a headache.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.310
One of y'all

03:46.393 --> 03:47.645
lit a fire in the trash can

03:47.728 --> 03:49.438
of the gender-neutral
bathroom last night.

03:49.521 --> 03:53.275
And whoever it was used a Pussy
Hat Pink Girlbossier lipstick

03:53.359 --> 03:57.196
to write "Weston is a binch"
on the bathroom mirror!

03:58.906 --> 03:59.823
Are you serious?

03:59.907 --> 04:01.325
What? Is "binch" funny?

04:01.408 --> 04:02.701
Is it worse than a bitch?

04:02.785 --> 04:06.246
I said, is it worse than bitch?
Answer me!

04:07.998 --> 04:10.000
Fine, you want to do this
the hard way?

04:10.084 --> 04:11.669
Come with me.

04:11.752 --> 04:15.130
Gentlemen, this fire safety
video is gonna be my legacy.

04:15.214 --> 04:17.257
The hottest directors
cut their teeth

04:17.341 --> 04:18.968
making instructional films.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.719
Jordan Peele got his start

04:20.803 --> 04:23.222
making creepy-as-fuck
CPR videos.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.598
Facts. That's canon.

04:24.682 --> 04:26.350
Future Fairfax kings and queens

04:26.433 --> 04:28.227
are gonna watch our video
when they accidentally

04:28.310 --> 04:30.604
blow their hands off,
recharging their vape pens.

04:30.688 --> 04:31.605
- All right.
- Yes.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.023
Dale, my lil' clout scout,

04:33.107 --> 04:34.817
you're on stunts
and pyrotechnics.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.777
I need you to bring the heat.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.070
Shh. Kapow.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.155
Doesn't get hotter
than this guy right here.

04:40.239 --> 04:41.365
Benny, you're my composer.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.574
I need a blazing soundtrack

04:42.658 --> 04:44.368
to bring out
the unbridled danger

04:44.451 --> 04:46.245
- of these roaring flames.
- Dawg,

04:46.328 --> 04:49.164
I got horns, I got woodwinds,
I got percussion.

04:49.248 --> 04:51.375
I'm about to go Hans Zimmer
up in this bitch.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.668
While you guys
work on that shit,

04:52.751 --> 04:54.795
I'm gonna get us
the biggest names possible

04:54.878 --> 04:57.089
to make this
a guaranteed banger.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.425
I want people talking about
our video for the rest of time.

04:59.508 --> 05:00.801
Let's go.

05:00.884 --> 05:01.719
Hands in.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.637
Gang Gang Productions on three.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.389
One, two, three...

05:05.472 --> 05:07.516
Gang Gang Productions!

05:10.978 --> 05:11.895
The library?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.981
But the Wi-Fi is terrible here.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.650
I mean, how long are you gonna
keep us in this hellhole?

05:16.734 --> 05:18.986
Until I get some answers.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.572
And if no one comes forward
by the end of the school day,

05:21.655 --> 05:24.283
y'all are suspended...

05:24.366 --> 05:25.409
- Okay?
- Okay.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.910
...from using your phones
in school.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.078
What the fuck?!

05:28.162 --> 05:29.538
- Are you high?
- You fucking psycho.

05:29.621 --> 05:30.539
I will sue!

05:46.221 --> 05:48.640
Oh, come on already, Derica.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.017
Fess up,
so we can get out of here.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.477
What, me?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.645
What about you,
you spirit chair sociopath?

05:53.729 --> 05:55.564
Everyone knows I haven't used
a school bathroom in years.

05:55.647 --> 05:56.690
Oh.

05:56.774 --> 05:58.692
So you just hold it in,
like a camel?

05:58.776 --> 06:00.194
I'm sorry, who are you?

06:00.277 --> 06:01.779
Jennifer. New girl.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.198
Transferred from Our Lady
of Gaga Prep in Sacramento.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.657
Parents work for the government.

06:05.741 --> 06:06.825
I signed a thick NDA.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.577
Can't really talk about it.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.661
Mm.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.455
Lily's got a point, Derica.

06:11.538 --> 06:15.793
This type of activist vandalism
has your name spray-painted

06:15.876 --> 06:17.628
all over it!

06:17.711 --> 06:18.921
Really, Jules?

06:19.004 --> 06:21.799
Coming from the guy
who lives for drama?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.217
What's my motive? Hmm?

06:23.300 --> 06:25.844
All I know is that I need to
get out of here ASAP,

06:25.928 --> 06:27.721
because it's my second
Prankiversary with Cody,

06:27.805 --> 06:29.473
and I cannot miss it.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.599
Cute little white girl say what?

06:30.682 --> 06:32.434
Prankiversary, duh.

06:32.518 --> 06:35.104
It's a celebration of the first
time he pranked me.

06:36.814 --> 06:38.190
<i>We had just started dating,</i>

06:38.273 --> 06:39.149
<i>and he shaved my eyebrows off</i>

06:39.233 --> 06:40.317
<i>while I was sleeping.</i>

06:41.610 --> 06:42.653
Every year, he celebrates

06:42.736 --> 06:44.988
by pranking me
super, super hard.

06:45.072 --> 06:45.989
Ooh, check it.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.116
This Unfairfactz poll

06:47.199 --> 06:49.576
says 72% of people

06:49.660 --> 06:51.578
<i>think Derica is guilty.</i>

06:54.915 --> 06:57.000
That has got to count
for something.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.377
They were right about Tommy G

06:58.460 --> 07:00.212
when he was using imitation crab
in his hand rolls,

07:00.295 --> 07:01.713
and they're right about you.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.133
Oh, eat shit, spirit chair.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.551
At Our Lady of Gaga,

07:05.634 --> 07:07.386
when we needed
to settle a disagreement,

07:07.469 --> 07:09.596
we either had a dance-off
or a mock trial.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.932
Yes! I love mock trials!

07:12.015 --> 07:15.185
Oh, wait, no, I'm thinking
of mock turtlenecks.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.020
All right.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.438
Pyrotechnics, how we doing?

07:18.522 --> 07:19.731
Ready to rock, Tru.

07:19.815 --> 07:20.899
Got my flint, kindling,

07:20.983 --> 07:22.276
Duraflame Latrine log,

07:22.359 --> 07:23.485
and a little fire extingy,

07:23.569 --> 07:25.571
just in case this pup
gets out of control.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.781
There we go, D-Money.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.367
Benny, where we at
with my symphony, playboy?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.493
Yo, check it out.

07:31.577 --> 07:32.870
I got the best
12-year-old orchestra

07:32.953 --> 07:35.747
the Fairfax Middle Philharmonic.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.292
Beautiful.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.252
Now all I need is my star.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.253
Don't fret.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.796
'Manda's here

07:42.880 --> 07:44.715
and totally not losing it

07:44.798 --> 07:47.593
without her mean gay
to base her personality on.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.345
Yo, what happened to Jules?

07:50.429 --> 07:51.847
His agents said he's in
detention, so we had to pivot.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.640
Places, people.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.809
All right,
we are stopping, dropping

07:55.893 --> 07:57.603
and rolling.

07:57.686 --> 07:58.687
Action.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.815
This court is now in session.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.360
Ooh, I always wanted
to say that.

08:05.444 --> 08:10.365
Derica Stratton-Torres,
aka @tacoboutchange,

08:10.449 --> 08:13.577
is it true that the lipstick
used at the scene of the crime

08:13.660 --> 08:15.871
is from your discontinued line
of Girlbossier lipsticks?

08:15.954 --> 08:16.872
Yeah.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.999
So? I wouldn't be caught dead

08:19.082 --> 08:21.835
repping that virtue-signaling
faux-feminist brand now.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.337
Cut the lip-shtick.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.547
Why were you
at school so late last night?

08:25.631 --> 08:28.884
I was waiting for kayak traffic
to die down, obviously.

08:28.967 --> 08:32.262
Oh, really,
that's, uh, interesting,

08:32.346 --> 08:33.597
because according to
your sosh meed feed

08:33.680 --> 08:35.724
you posted that
you were planning to

08:38.143 --> 08:39.311
Ooh!

08:39.394 --> 08:41.980
This is so good,
I'm gonna grab me some SkinnyPop

08:42.064 --> 08:43.899
and cuddle up
with an Hermès blankie.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.860
No, I was literally
slaying my foundation.

08:46.944 --> 08:49.571
It's for my anti-makeup makeup
tutorials that I've been posting

08:49.655 --> 08:51.073
to raise awareness
for natural beauty.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.783
- Stay woke.
- Shit.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.952
"Dareeca's" telling the truth.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.579
<i>What's up, it's your girl</i>
<i>Derica.</i>

08:57.663 --> 08:58.747
<i>So today, we're gonna...</i>

08:58.830 --> 08:59.957
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Pause the video.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.041
<i>...slay your foundation.</i>

09:01.124 --> 09:02.918
That looks
like New Girl.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.128
Hey, w-what did you say
your name was?

09:05.212 --> 09:06.588
Jessica.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.006
Jennifer.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.424
Hmm?

09:09.508 --> 09:11.510
"JP plus HJC"?

09:11.593 --> 09:12.594
Hyung-Joon Cho...

09:12.678 --> 09:14.763
Oh, my God!

09:14.846 --> 09:16.556
You're Jennifer,
from Benny's church.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.685
Yo, this psycho lying binch
is from the Upside Down.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.311
She definitely did it.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.110
<i>Oh, no, I'm ablaze!</i>

09:28.193 --> 09:31.071
<i>What do I do?!</i>

09:33.573 --> 09:35.701
Gah, some of your
best work yet, Tru.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.869
The fire, the music,
it all pops.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.371
- Hmm.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.706
Damn it.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.083
This vid is all sizzle
and no steak.

09:43.166 --> 09:46.295
Yo, if this is gonna be
our legacy, we got to go bigger.

09:46.378 --> 09:47.546
Say no more, fam.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.631
We 'bout to turn
this lil' fire safety film

09:49.715 --> 09:51.508
into a four-quadrant tentpole.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.969
Ey, dawg, remember
that favor you owe me?

09:54.052 --> 09:57.723
Well, slap some rosin on
that bow, 'cause I'm cashing in.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.349
Jennifer Park,

09:59.433 --> 10:03.103
is it true you pretended
to be a Spectrum repairman

10:03.186 --> 10:04.521
so you could set up
hidden cameras

10:04.604 --> 10:06.398
in Benny's room last April?

10:06.481 --> 10:08.775
Yeah, and I'd do it again
in a heartbeat.

10:08.859 --> 10:10.277
Talk about peak TV.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.778
God, that's hot.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.614
I wish someone
would <i>Fatal Attraction</i> me.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.241
Why were you at school
last night?!

10:16.325 --> 10:17.159
You don't even go here!

10:17.242 --> 10:19.328
I transferred yesterday.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.746
I had orientation.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.331
I came to pick up
my class schedule.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.082
Okay, stalkerazzi.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.919
Then how do you explain this?

10:28.003 --> 10:29.755
Looks like somebody

10:29.838 --> 10:32.966
enjoys crafting
the occasional fire post.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.885
Maybe a little too much?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.136
That doesn't prove anything.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.264
you burned down
your last school, too?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.559
I'm sorry.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.311
Y'all know where
Principal Weston is?

10:44.394 --> 10:46.605
Boo wanted to have a drink
before Truman's premiere thingy.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.190
Try the theater!

10:49.191 --> 10:50.901
Why would I do this?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.987
I didn't even meet this sad,
bald man until yesterday.

10:54.071 --> 10:56.698
And I certainly didn't hate him
until he put me in detention.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.200
I just...

10:58.283 --> 11:00.786
Listen, I can't get in trouble
on my first day.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.371
My parents will ship me
to Palo Alto

11:02.454 --> 11:04.373
and force me
to get a coding job at Google.

11:04.456 --> 11:05.832
I think she's telling the truth.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.084
I-I would know.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.668
I'm a raging thespian.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.380
I lie professionally every day.

11:11.463 --> 11:14.007
All right, Judge Julesy,
if you love drama so much,

11:14.091 --> 11:15.634
why don't you take the hot seat?

11:15.717 --> 11:17.552
Unlike the skeletons
in your closet,

11:17.636 --> 11:19.388
I have nothing to hide.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.223
I was born without a closet.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.683
And then I built a new one
and redecorated it.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.936
Chic, bitch.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.271
Got to be honest, Jules,

11:28.355 --> 11:29.940
I'm a big fan of your podcast.

11:30.023 --> 11:34.111
Yeah, you and the other 53
<i>Talking Sondheim</i> subscribers.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.238
So, I was listening to one
of your riveting episodes,

11:36.321 --> 11:38.532
and I couldn't help but notice
that you said

11:38.615 --> 11:39.658
some pretty mean stuff

11:39.741 --> 11:40.992
about Principal Weston.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.912
Like "ready to torch
a bathroom" mean!

11:46.957 --> 11:50.502
It's not my fault he refused
to let me direct-slash-star

11:50.585 --> 11:52.754
in a genderbent version
of <i>Annie!</i>

11:52.838 --> 11:54.297
Wait, isn't that just <i>Oliver?</i>

11:54.381 --> 11:56.716
You bite your tongue.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.260
Genderblind casting
is the future.

11:58.343 --> 12:02.264
Besides, any real ones know
I only write in cursive.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.808
It's the only font
that openly identifies as queer.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.185
So, it couldn't have been me.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.687
See?

12:08.770 --> 12:11.106
The handwriting
doesn't match.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.108
By the way, bitch,
your shoe's untied.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.109
Oh.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.403
Hey!

12:16.486 --> 12:18.029
I know that ugly anklet.

12:20.282 --> 12:21.450
Missing something,

12:21.533 --> 12:22.659
Spirit Binch?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.120
<i>Le scandale.</i>

12:34.254 --> 12:35.964
There he is!

12:36.047 --> 12:38.216
Joaquin-Bean! Baby!

12:38.300 --> 12:40.343
Yo, thanks so much
for doing this.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.554
Hey, I'm humbled to be here,
Truman.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.556
I mean,
as soon as I read the script,

12:44.639 --> 12:48.894
was the role of a lifetime.

12:48.977 --> 12:50.645
'Manda, I hate to do this,

12:50.729 --> 12:51.897
but you been bumped, baby.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.315
I'm crushed.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.442
But also used to it.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.529
Truman, I want you to meet
Michael Babcock.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.156
He hangs around Oy Vape
sometimes

13:01.239 --> 13:03.366
and did the pyro stunts
for <i>Chicago Fire.</i>

13:03.450 --> 13:04.826
They call me Icarus,

13:04.910 --> 13:07.829
'cause I fly too close
to the sun.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.539
Welcome aboard, Icarus.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.875
'Ey, yo, yo, yo! We got Yo-Yo!

13:11.958 --> 13:13.293
And... wait for it...

13:17.839 --> 13:19.466
- What? Bro!
- No way!

13:19.549 --> 13:20.717
...Future!

13:20.800 --> 13:22.552
Yo-Yo, hit this shit,
you'll win a Grammy.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.597
- Trust.
- Bitch, I already have,
like, 20.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.059
"Fire safety
the next big franchise?"

13:29.142 --> 13:31.853
Now that's legacy.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.021
So, tell me,

13:33.104 --> 13:36.107
what was
your cringe-ass prank charm

13:36.191 --> 13:37.901
doing at the scene of the crime?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.361
Huh? Huh?!

13:39.444 --> 13:41.154
I don't know.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.740
I was
in a spirit chair meeting.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.367
And then I went over to Cody's

13:45.450 --> 13:47.035
to celebrate
our Prankiversary Eve.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.370
Like, what? Duh.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.746
Oh, that's funny.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.165
Because,
according to Cody's TikTok,

13:52.249 --> 13:53.833
he was alone last night.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.294
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:56.378 --> 13:58.213
I think we found our culprit!

13:58.296 --> 14:00.131
Stop being such a binch, Derica.

14:00.215 --> 14:01.424
You want the binch?

14:01.508 --> 14:03.301
You can't handle the binch!

14:03.385 --> 14:05.845
I was pooping, okay?!

14:05.929 --> 14:07.055
- W...

14:07.138 --> 14:08.306
I get really bad anxiety poos!

14:08.390 --> 14:10.100
I'm always stressing
because I don't know

14:10.183 --> 14:11.851
what stupid prank
Cody's gonna pull next.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.854
I live in a constant state
of fear, and I am sick of it!

14:14.938 --> 14:16.940
Yes, I was in the bathroom
pooping.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.526
But I swear I didn't do it.
I didn't!

14:19.609 --> 14:21.987
Damn! This is
some real-ass shit.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.488
Please don't tell anyone.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.073
This could ruin me.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.576
But if none of us did it,

14:27.659 --> 14:28.827
who did?

14:30.537 --> 14:33.373
I guess that means
we're all losing our phones.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.375
And we're
gonna have to, like...

14:35.458 --> 14:38.378
pay attention
in class now.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.673
Now how am I supposed to track
Benny's every single move?

14:41.756 --> 14:43.592
At least old Librarian Larsen

14:43.675 --> 14:45.427
isn't bugging us
in our final hours

14:45.510 --> 14:47.345
with her stank-ass
kombucha breath.

14:47.429 --> 14:49.431
Mm, binch thinks
she's being so sneaky

14:49.514 --> 14:51.099
with that mini fridge
under her desk.

14:51.182 --> 14:54.102
- We all know
you got a problem, girl!

14:55.604 --> 14:56.813
What do you think you're doing?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.024
If we're going down,
we might as well get down.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.951
"Is It Really Coming Round"]

15:35.977 --> 15:38.313
- You guys want to know
who killed Jeffrey Epstein?

15:38.396 --> 15:39.314
- Yeah!
- Oh!

15:56.247 --> 15:57.999
Help, help,
help, help, help, help!

16:11.137 --> 16:12.430
Did we just...

16:12.514 --> 16:15.308
Make a video promoting fire?

16:15.392 --> 16:18.061
Damn, bro!

16:19.396 --> 16:21.314
Soy...

16:21.398 --> 16:23.316
binch to binch,

16:23.400 --> 16:24.734
why'd you really switch schools?

16:24.818 --> 16:26.152
Cheating scandal? Drugs?

16:26.236 --> 16:29.364
Ooh, were you toxically
and systematically bullied?

16:29.447 --> 16:30.573
Actually,

16:30.657 --> 16:32.992
- I did the bullying.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.578
I was expelled for reverse
<i>Whiplashing</i> my music teacher.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.373
In my defense though, he
wasn't pushing me hard enough.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.792
That is the most bad binch thing
I've ever heard.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.293
AOC is shaking.

16:42.377 --> 16:45.380
Everyone at my old school
thought I was crazy. I just...

16:45.463 --> 16:47.924
I didn't want to come into
this school with the same rep.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.385
It's... it's hard enough
to make friends.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.303
Especially when you're better
than everyone.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.639
Then it's time
for a clean slate.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.975
- Oh, my God. She's gonna do it.
Do it, do it.
- Yes. Yes.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.936
- Do it, do it, do it, do it, do
it, do it, do it, do it, do it.
- I burn my Insta to the ground.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.981
A new Jennifer rises
from the ashes.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.070
'Kay, she is terrifying.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.489
In the best way. We stan.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.949
Honestly... I just...

17:13.032 --> 17:15.118
I can't believe I told y'all
that I shit like a goose.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.954
- Girl, you got to do
what's best for number one.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.123
Even if that means
going number two.

17:20.206 --> 17:22.125
Things with Cody
are just so complicated.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.962
A-And people only see me as
one half of this perfect couple

17:26.045 --> 17:28.381
that I don't even want
to be in anymore.

17:28.465 --> 17:31.551
Without Cody and the Triangle,
what's my brand?

17:31.634 --> 17:33.386
I'm nothing without him.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.472
Hey. That's not true.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.182
You're way more than that.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.851
I'm sorry I was such
an accusatory binch earlier.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.686
The truth is,

17:41.770 --> 17:43.813
I wasn't waiting
for kayak traffic to die down.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.899
I was crying in the chem lab.

17:45.982 --> 17:47.525
Oh, my gosh. Derica.

17:47.609 --> 17:50.069
Between Melody
and being a Derewolf

17:50.153 --> 17:52.030
and being coopted
by an evil corporation,

17:52.113 --> 17:54.032
I just needed a good cry.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.451
And, look,
I love my gang gang-- I do--

17:56.534 --> 17:59.204
but it's super hard
opening up to a bunch of boys.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.371
No offense, Jules.

18:00.455 --> 18:01.790
Don't you dare label me.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.751
I know my brand is strength
and kick-ass activism,

18:04.834 --> 18:06.711
but sometimes
I don't feel very strong.

18:06.795 --> 18:09.214
Sometimes I just want
to be vulnerable.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.049
Wait. Uh-uh,
why am I sharing this?

18:11.132 --> 18:13.134
Because we're friggin' friends.

18:13.218 --> 18:15.053
We're totally friends.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.680
I also have
a confession to make.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.349
I have a standing appointment

18:19.432 --> 18:20.975
with the school
guidance counselor.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.186
And it's not because he's hot.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.355
That's why I was at school.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.482
He helps me
work through the fact that...

18:28.650 --> 18:31.569
...I have no drama at home.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.530
- Aw!
- Aw!

18:33.613 --> 18:37.158
It's like my parents
are soy happy together

18:37.242 --> 18:40.578
and they're sor supportive.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.580
Uh, it's why I'm so hard
on 'Manda.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.500
She gives me
my daily dose of vitamin D

18:45.583 --> 18:48.920
that I need to stay
cah-linically quenched.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.840
I don't fully understand the
problem, but I'm here for you.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.675
My mom is
so freakin' perfect.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.093
It kills me.

18:55.176 --> 18:56.761
The worst thing I can say

18:56.845 --> 18:59.472
is that she's addicted to Advil.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.809
Yeah. It's like,
girl, at least use Ambien

19:02.892 --> 19:04.978
and hide it in an Advil bottle!

19:05.061 --> 19:06.020
That's it!

19:06.104 --> 19:08.022
O-M-G!

19:08.106 --> 19:09.357
You guys!

19:09.440 --> 19:11.150
I know who did it.

19:13.570 --> 19:16.948
Ugh, the premiere is
in 30 minutes and I got nothing.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.993
My legacy is up in flames,
and I was just getting started.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.619
Look, Truman, as a scout,

19:21.703 --> 19:23.997
you know how important
fire safety is to me.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.540
You can still do this.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.418
You just got to show people
fire's not lit.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.669
Dale's right, dawg.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.838
Fuck the press
and that legacy shit.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.923
Just go back
to making your movie.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.341
You're right, bro.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.886
I thought I was ready
for big budgets, but I'm not.

19:37.969 --> 19:39.971
Even Ryan Coogler had
to make <i>Fruitvale Station</i>

19:40.054 --> 19:41.723
before Marvel gave him
<i>Black Panther.</i>

19:41.806 --> 19:44.225
'Ey, you guys got
one more take in you?

19:45.894 --> 19:48.396
Oh! Oh. Oh, well, lookee here.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.399
which one of y'all did it?

19:51.482 --> 19:52.609
You did!

19:52.692 --> 19:53.860
Say wha?

19:53.943 --> 19:55.862
Break it down for him, binches.

19:55.945 --> 19:58.114
The Advil you
keep popping is actually Ambien.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.741
Your wife switched 'em out
because you prefer

19:59.824 --> 20:01.117
the blue bottle, but you forgot
you're actually taking Ambien,

20:01.200 --> 20:02.327
which explains why
you don't have any recollection

20:02.410 --> 20:03.411
of what happened last night.

20:03.494 --> 20:04.621
Oh, I actually still have
some breath left.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.040
Girl, that is the craziest

20:07.123 --> 20:08.458
- bunch of...
- Furthermore,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.460
when your wife came into
the library looking for you,

20:10.543 --> 20:11.961
<i>she was wearing Pussy Hat Pink</i>
<i>Girlbossier lipstick,</i>

20:12.045 --> 20:12.962
<i>the same shade</i>

20:13.046 --> 20:14.881
found on the bathroom mirror!

20:14.964 --> 20:17.508
Now,
hold on just a second...

20:17.592 --> 20:20.303
Also, the photo you posted
at approximately 7:49 p.m.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.429
of you on the hood

20:21.512 --> 20:23.765
<i>of your Chrysler Sebring</i>
<i>was geotagged</i>

20:23.848 --> 20:25.808
<i>from the gender-neutral bathroom</i>

20:25.892 --> 20:26.851
in question.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.354
- But-but-but...
- And, finally,

20:31.230 --> 20:32.732
the book on your desk.

20:32.815 --> 20:35.485
Looks like "binch" has

20:35.568 --> 20:37.862
"bitch," "friend"

20:37.946 --> 20:41.532
- and "Businessman In Charge"!
- Oh!

20:41.616 --> 20:44.494
<i>You got drunk</i>
<i>on Ambien last night,</i>

20:44.577 --> 20:47.038
<i>stumbled into</i>
<i>the gender-neutral bathroom,</i>

20:47.121 --> 20:49.207
<i>wrote on the mirror</i>
<i>with your wife's lipstick</i>

20:49.290 --> 20:52.085
<i>and torched the place.</i>

20:52.168 --> 20:53.294
Any questions?

20:58.466 --> 21:00.969
How much y'all want
to stay silent?

21:01.052 --> 21:02.428
- High five!

21:02.512 --> 21:05.348
Bye, binch! Yes!

21:09.185 --> 21:12.188
D! Our registered felon.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.607
'Ey, saved you a seat.
We missed you today.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.275
Aw, and I missed my gang gang.

21:16.359 --> 21:19.654
But I'm gonna sit with
some new friends I made today.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.698
Hold on, new friends? The fuck?

21:21.781 --> 21:24.367
Don't trip. I'll see you
in, like, three minutes.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.868
- Hey!

21:32.834 --> 21:34.794
Hi there!
I'm Hypy the Hypebeast,

21:34.877 --> 21:37.505
and I'm hyped
to teach you about fire.

21:37.588 --> 21:40.758
Grr, I'm Fire!

21:40.842 --> 21:42.385
Woo...!

21:42.468 --> 21:43.970
- Aah!
- You know what's not fire?

21:44.053 --> 21:45.596
An out of control fire.

21:45.680 --> 21:46.764
Careful there, flame,

21:46.848 --> 21:48.766
'cause I'm 'bout to 'stinguish
your ass.

21:48.850 --> 21:50.935
Hey, Fireman Benny,
hit me with a beat!

21:55.148 --> 21:56.983
Oh, no!

21:57.066 --> 21:59.277
I'm melting!

21:59.360 --> 22:00.820
<i>Goddamn you,</i>

22:00.903 --> 22:03.740
Hypy and your super safe ways.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.992
- Ha. And remember, kids,

22:06.075 --> 22:08.411
fire is not lit.

22:08.494 --> 22:11.497
No animals, minerals
or vegetables

22:11.581 --> 22:12.749
were harmed in the making

22:12.832 --> 22:14.584
<i>of this fire safety video.</i>

22:16.502 --> 22:18.588
It's your moment, dawg!
Get up there!

22:18.671 --> 22:21.466
Yeah! Give these
thirsty stans what they want!

22:21.549 --> 22:24.594
Oh, my God,
I-I want to thank all the people

22:24.677 --> 22:26.679
and all the fires everywhere.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.598
Major shout to the one
who inspired me

22:28.681 --> 22:30.349
to give directing another shot--

22:30.433 --> 22:32.018
my support system for life,

22:32.101 --> 22:33.770
my everything--

22:33.853 --> 22:35.855
my girlfriend, Cerise!

22:35.938 --> 22:38.399
- What the fuck?!
- What the heck?

22:38.483 --> 22:39.901
Oh, come on!

22:39.984 --> 22:41.402
Did you guys know
he was back with Cerise?

22:41.486 --> 22:42.612
I mean,

22:42.695 --> 22:44.947
it's definitely fucked-up
that he didn't thank us.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.949
But, hey, people be dating AIs.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.326
I don't know
what Siri looks like,

22:48.409 --> 22:50.078
but her voice
gives me butterflies.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.829
Hey, do you think
she's listening to us

22:51.913 --> 22:53.289
when we masturba...
Hey!

22:53.372 --> 22:55.416
- Truman! There he is!
- Hey!
- There's my man.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.502
- My boy!
- That was crazy!
- Hey, skank breath.

22:57.585 --> 23:00.588
- Look, I'm sorry
I'm so hard on you, but...
- Shut up!

23:00.671 --> 23:02.632
Just shut up.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.509
You had me at "skank breath."

23:04.592 --> 23:06.177
So then I say to Padma,

23:06.260 --> 23:08.763
"Thanks to me, you..."
Oh, babe! There you are!

23:08.846 --> 23:10.473
We need to talk, Cody.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.935
I am sick of the pranks, and I
am sick of the stupid Triangle.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.729
I don't need you
or your cringe clout anymore.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.898
I am gonna go find my own brand!

23:18.981 --> 23:21.192
- Huh?
- What don't you get?

23:21.275 --> 23:23.945
Dating you was
my charitable component.

23:24.028 --> 23:24.946
We're through!

23:25.029 --> 23:27.698
Happy Prankiversary, ya binch.

23:27.782 --> 23:29.700
Oh, my dick!

23:29.784 --> 23:32.662
Babe. Babe,
th-that was a prank, right?

23:32.745 --> 23:33.746
Right?

23:35.456 --> 23:37.041
Whoa. Lily dumped Cody?

23:39.752 --> 23:40.962
Hi, Hyung-Joon.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.380
- Ooh, guess what.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.090
I go here now.

23:44.173 --> 23:45.967
And I hacked
the school database, so...

23:46.050 --> 23:47.969
I'm in
all your classes.

23:48.052 --> 23:51.180
Jesus Christ!

24:51.657 --> 24:53.618
Chirp.
