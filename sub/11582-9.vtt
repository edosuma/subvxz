(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.137 --> 00:04.072
sexually based offenses

00:04.105 --> 00:06.774
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.242
In New York City,

00:08.276 --> 00:09.577
the dedicated detectives

00:09.610 --> 00:11.445
who investigate these
vicious felonies

00:11.479 --> 00:13.447
are members of
an elite squad known as

00:13.481 --> 00:15.049
the Special Victims Unit.

00:15.083 --> 00:16.184
These are their stories.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.271
[knock at door]

00:41.709 --> 00:45.113
[woman crying]

00:45.146 --> 00:47.648
(Benson)
Colleen?

00:47.681 --> 00:50.118
I'm Olivia Benson.
I'm a police officer.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.552
Can you open the door?

00:51.585 --> 00:54.488
[panicked breathing]

00:54.522 --> 00:55.789
Colleen.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.358
We're here to help you.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.659
Your landlord
gave me the key,

00:58.692 --> 01:01.329
but I'm not gonna use it
unless you say I can.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.134
Can you say something,
Colleen?

01:06.167 --> 01:07.101
Let us know
that you're all right?

01:07.135 --> 01:08.402
I'm here!

01:08.436 --> 01:09.770
Good.
Is anybody with you?

01:09.803 --> 01:12.206
No.
I'm alone.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.108
Okay.

01:14.142 --> 01:17.278
Can we open the door?

01:17.311 --> 01:18.312
Colleen?

01:22.516 --> 01:23.484
Are you hurt?

01:23.517 --> 01:24.485
No.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.753
I just need my chair.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.521
Okay, we're gonna
get it for you.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.423
Colleen, that's Detective
Stabler.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.225
And these are Officers
Tanner and Galloway.

01:31.259 --> 01:32.226
They're the ones who were

01:32.260 --> 01:33.227
knocking on your door.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.329
Can I--
Just get me in it.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.531
(female dispatch on radio)
2-0 Adam on the air.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.733
(Galloway)
On the air, Central.

01:39.767 --> 01:43.704
You okay?
Yes, yeah.

01:43.737 --> 01:46.274
Colleen, you told
the 911 operator

01:46.307 --> 01:47.475
that the man
who attacked you

01:47.508 --> 01:49.377
left two hours
before you called.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.878
He told me to wait

01:50.911 --> 01:53.481
or he would come back.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.716
And when I heard them knocking,
I thought it was him.

01:55.749 --> 01:56.850
Testing me.

01:56.884 --> 01:59.187
He might still be watching.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.554
He could still come back.

02:00.588 --> 02:01.555
(Stabler)
They always say

02:01.589 --> 02:02.623
they're gonna come back.

02:02.656 --> 02:03.791
They never do.

02:03.824 --> 02:04.925
[knock at door]
Detectives.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.627
Better listen to this:

02:06.660 --> 02:08.662
10-5 that, Central.

02:08.696 --> 02:09.930
(dispatch)
Be advised we're receiving

02:09.963 --> 02:12.233
a report of a second
sexual assault

02:12.266 --> 02:14.768
at 65 West 95th street
apartment six-David.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.370
Another rape?

02:16.404 --> 02:17.505
That's four flights up.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.791
(female)
The hallway was empty.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.227
(Stabler)
What time was this, Samantha?

03:13.261 --> 03:16.264
2:30.

03:16.297 --> 03:19.433
We had just gotten in
from the airport.

03:19.467 --> 03:22.536
I put my key
in the door, and...

03:22.570 --> 03:24.772
He grabbed me
from behind.

03:24.805 --> 03:25.973
What happened then?

03:26.006 --> 03:28.276
He pushed us inside and--

03:28.309 --> 03:30.378
[sighs]

03:30.411 --> 03:35.283
He wouldn't let me
turn on the lights.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.318
He was behind me
the whole time.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.986
I woke up and he was just
sitting there,

03:39.019 --> 03:40.721
right at the end
of my bed.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.457
I thought
that I was dreaming.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.326
But then he--

03:45.359 --> 03:47.395
he put his hand
over my mouth and--

03:47.428 --> 03:48.396
It's okay, Colleen.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.499
Just take your time, okay?

03:51.532 --> 03:53.634
I don't know how
he got in.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.902
That window's always locked.

03:54.935 --> 03:55.903
(Siper)
The lock was broken.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.571
Building cheaped out.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.640
These things break if you
blow on 'em too hard.

03:59.673 --> 04:00.708
She couldn't see
up this high

04:00.741 --> 04:02.610
from where she
was sitting, though.

04:02.643 --> 04:03.944
Fire escape ladder's
been pulled down.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.413
That made some noise.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.481
Downstairs neighbors
might've heard it.

04:07.515 --> 04:08.849
(Colleen)
He rolled me over
onto my stomach.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.784
I never saw his face.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.853
Okay.

04:12.886 --> 04:17.024
Did he seem particularly
short or tall?

04:17.057 --> 04:18.392
How 'bout, uh,

04:18.426 --> 04:20.428
Smell.
Do you remember a smell?

04:20.461 --> 04:22.363
An aftershave?
Some kind of soap?

04:22.396 --> 04:24.932
Cigarettes.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.535
Stale.
Like a bar.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.638
Did he say anything?

04:30.671 --> 04:31.805
[inhales]

04:31.839 --> 04:35.743
He wanted me
to tell him things.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.646
How good he was.

04:38.679 --> 04:42.816
How much I liked it.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.485
And I said it.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.755
It was like
he needed it.

04:47.788 --> 04:51.859
To get going.

04:51.892 --> 04:52.860
I don't know
and even then,

04:52.893 --> 04:55.863
he couldn't finish.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.398
He got so angry.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.066
And Benjamin started to cry,

04:59.099 --> 05:01.301
and I just shut my eyes.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.709
And then he was
just gone.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.544
(Fin)
That the escape route?

05:10.578 --> 05:12.513
(CSU Tech)
Down in the alley.
Six flights.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.582
You're gonna have to print
all these railings.

05:14.615 --> 05:15.816
What's that?

05:15.849 --> 05:16.850
Condom wrapper.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.419
Guy was taking out
the trash.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.521
This oughta give us
some nice prints.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.756
I don't think
you're gonna find anything.

05:22.790 --> 05:23.824
He wore gloves.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.460
When did he push the wheelchair
out of your bedroom?

05:26.494 --> 05:27.528
After.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.062
He had to do one more thing

05:29.096 --> 05:30.598
to show me how helpless I am.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.032
Colleen.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.134
We are gonna get
this guy

05:34.167 --> 05:37.037
because of the information
that you've given us.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.407
That's not helpless.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.709
Now, is there anything else
that you can remember?

05:41.742 --> 05:43.577
Anything else that was
familiar about him?

05:43.611 --> 05:44.745
I don't think

05:44.778 --> 05:45.846
I know him.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.516
But...

05:48.549 --> 05:49.883
He knows me.

05:49.917 --> 05:50.918
Why do you say that?

05:50.951 --> 05:54.087
He just kept saying that--

05:54.121 --> 05:55.889
I wasn't as good
as he imagined

05:55.923 --> 05:58.526
when he first saw me.

05:58.559 --> 06:02.996
He thought I was
gonna be "the one".

06:03.030 --> 06:03.997
Neighborhood canvas
is ongoing.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.065
CSU is still
pawing through

06:05.098 --> 06:06.434
the Dumpsters
in the alley.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.668
Two rapes in under an hour.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.169
This guy's not
wasting any time.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.738
I think he stalked
the first victim.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.139
Perp sounds like
he's seen her before.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.741
And Samantha
was opportunity.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.142
That guy's on a binge.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.877
The first rape didn't live up
to his fantasy...

06:16.910 --> 06:18.579
He sees Samantha
after he's left Colleen,

06:18.612 --> 06:19.847
figures he has
another chance

06:19.880 --> 06:20.914
at finding
the perfect girl.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.015
Only there never is
a perfect girl.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.984
He's gonna keep looking.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.619
I'll run the M.O.
through VICAP

06:25.653 --> 06:26.854
back at the house.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.422
Detectives.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.524
St. Catherine's ER
has a woman

06:30.558 --> 06:31.925
who was attacked
two blocks from here.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.026
Could be our guy.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.731
(woman)
He may have wanted to, but...

06:37.765 --> 06:38.899
he didn't rape me.

06:38.932 --> 06:39.933
Not that he wasn't trying.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.101
So what happened?

06:41.134 --> 06:42.636
He just grabbed me
right off the sidewalk,

06:42.670 --> 06:43.871
pulled me into an alley,

06:43.904 --> 06:44.938
threw me against
the wall.

06:44.972 --> 06:45.939
I screamed.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.608
But that hour--
no one's around.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.109
What time was that?
4:00-something.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.011
I had just gotten off of work.
Paulie's Tavern.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.046
He told me not to fight,
that he wasn't gonna hurt me.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.448
But I know that's crap,

06:54.482 --> 06:55.649
so I popped him
with my crutch.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.552
Why did you wait
before coming to the hospital?

06:58.586 --> 06:59.753
He got pissed
that I was fighting,

06:59.787 --> 07:01.188
so he bashed my head
against the wall

07:01.221 --> 07:02.456
I passed out.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.057
Next thing I know,
some guy in a suit

07:04.091 --> 07:05.092
is standing over me,

07:05.125 --> 07:06.860
saying an ambulance
is on the way.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.128
We got blood here.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.730
So, Gina,

07:09.763 --> 07:10.998
you were on these crutches
before the attack.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.033
Yeah.
Knee surgery.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.635
Woman in a wheelchair,

07:14.668 --> 07:15.769
one with a baby,

07:15.803 --> 07:17.037
another with a bum leg.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.706
You think you got
a good enough

07:18.739 --> 07:21.108
look at him to work
with a sketch artist?

07:21.141 --> 07:22.576
He was behind me
most of the time.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.044
White guy.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.846
Hood of his sweatshirt
pulled over his head.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.247
Big sunglasses.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.916
Smelled like an ashtray.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.918
Guess it's not gonna help you
for your sketch.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.954
Unless it's
a scratch-n-sniff, right?

07:33.987 --> 07:34.822
(Munch)
Oh, it's great.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.023
Our rapist is
the Unabomber.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.124
It's more to warn
the neighborhood

07:37.157 --> 07:38.792
than to identify the guy.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.528
And you're sure
it's the same perp?

07:40.561 --> 07:41.428
It's the same M.O.,
Captain.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.263
The only reason he beat up
the last victim

07:43.296 --> 07:44.832
is 'cause she
fought back.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.266
Well, why didn't
he rape her?
She was knocked out.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.668
Maybe he only likes 'em
when they're conscious.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.636
(Munch)
Or something scared him off.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.971
He chooses women who are
physically vulnerable.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.239
We're thinking that
he's new at the game.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.874
Three women in one night.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.043
And not a single one got a good
look at the guy.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.745
He's off to a hell
of a start.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.212
Something set him off.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.581
Forensics find anything?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.015
No prints,

08:02.049 --> 08:03.050
rape kit turned up
spermicide,

08:03.083 --> 08:04.585
no semen,

08:04.618 --> 08:06.053
DNA from the blood
on the crutch

08:06.086 --> 08:07.721
is still running through
the system--nothing yet.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.657
This third victim
who wasn't raped--

08:09.690 --> 08:11.158
if somebody scared him off,
they could've seen something.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.259
(Munch)
He attacked her in an alley.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.794
at 4:00 in the morning.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.162
Could've been trash collection
or a delivery man.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.830
I'll ask around.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.198
If Colleen was being
stalked by this guy,

08:18.231 --> 08:20.000
maybe somebody noticed
something.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.102
Find out where she's been
the last few days.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.174
(woman)
I'm so upset about this.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.676
We all love Colleen.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.277
Comes in for a manicure
and pedicure

08:30.310 --> 08:31.779
about once a week.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.213
She said just
because she can't walk

08:33.246 --> 08:34.648
don't mean her feet
can't be pretty.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.116
Mm.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.651
Did you notice anyone

08:37.685 --> 08:39.019
paying particular
attention to her

08:39.052 --> 08:40.688
the last time
she was in here?

08:40.721 --> 08:41.655
You know what's
kinda awful?

08:41.689 --> 08:44.091
Everybody stares at the girl
in the wheelchair.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.993
Any male clients
that day?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.194
Annie.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.195
You did a guy's nails

08:48.228 --> 08:48.996
the other day, didn't you?

08:49.029 --> 08:49.997
Yeah.

08:50.030 --> 08:50.998
What a mess.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.132
How so?

08:52.165 --> 08:53.266
They were filthy.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.668
And he chewed 'em half off.

08:54.702 --> 08:57.104
Not much I could do for him.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.806
Like you.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.040
I got some bitter nail polish
if you want.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.141
Uh, thanks, no.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.242
Can you describe him?

09:02.275 --> 09:04.945
Uh, white.
Average.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.213
Hair color?
Eye color?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.582
Sorry. I was looking at his
hands, not his face.

09:08.616 --> 09:09.917
Besides,
he was wearing shades.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.886
Kinda like that?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.354
Maybe.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.223
Isn't that the Unabomber?

09:18.191 --> 09:19.660
(Fin)
Find Colleen's stalker?

09:19.693 --> 09:22.362
Everybody saw him,
nobody remembers him.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.731
What about Gina's attacker?

09:23.764 --> 09:25.198
Any witnesses could've
scared him off?

09:25.232 --> 09:26.734
Delivery guy didn't see her,

09:26.767 --> 09:28.702
but he saw a guy come running
out of the alley

09:28.736 --> 09:30.037
get into a dark Ford Taurus,

09:30.070 --> 09:31.204
mid to late '80s.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.940
But he didn't get
a license plate number.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.675
Only 20,000 or so
Ford Tauruses

09:34.708 --> 09:36.109
in the five boroughs.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.645
Who wants to start
knocking on doors?

09:37.678 --> 09:39.246
Well, why don't we call Huang,
get him down here.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.714
At least get him started
on a profile.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.916
He's not available.
He's on assignment in D.C.

09:42.950 --> 09:45.285
(woman)
Three and four,
four of them are three.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.656
Three of them are right.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.291
Can I help you?

09:51.324 --> 09:52.860
Unit of measure

09:52.893 --> 09:54.895
for chloride and anhydride
and dicarboxylic acid

09:54.928 --> 09:56.730
and unit three and four,
four of them are--

09:56.764 --> 09:58.899
three--
three of them are right.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.201
It's the pattern
of the principle.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.236
They know the unit.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.838
The over-the-shoulder--

10:04.872 --> 10:07.841
Ma'am?
Do you know where you are?

10:07.875 --> 10:08.876
Ma'am.

10:08.909 --> 10:13.981
[panting]

10:14.014 --> 10:16.183
We're gonna take you
someplace safe, okay?

10:16.216 --> 10:19.386
If this is the principle,
the preamble,

10:19.419 --> 10:21.989
the perimeter
of 14 and 17 and 22.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.957
Or--or 36 and 30--

10:23.991 --> 10:25.325
Seven.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.962
The bonds, underscore...

10:28.996 --> 10:30.030
Four and six--

10:30.063 --> 10:31.765
Four units.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.734
But only three
in carbon.

10:33.767 --> 10:39.139
(Benson)
Elliot.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.374
Ma'am.

10:41.408 --> 10:43.343
Were you attacked?

10:43.376 --> 10:45.746
Yes, that was the reason

10:45.779 --> 10:48.048
they knew with the, uh,

10:48.081 --> 10:50.150
the signal and
the sarin gas

10:50.183 --> 10:51.118
to get over in time.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.853
Okay, why don't we go
someplace where we can--

10:52.886 --> 10:53.687
[woman gasps]

10:58.859 --> 10:59.827
(Stabler)
Hey, you're gonna--

10:59.860 --> 11:00.761
You're gonna hurt yourself.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.666
(Stabler)
Shh, shh, shh.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.711
What the hell is going on?

11:17.745 --> 11:20.180
Could be victim number four.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.950
Get a bus to Bellevue Psych
and go with her.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.390
Pressure 150 over 100.
Miss, do you know
your name?

11:30.423 --> 11:32.025
I found this ID
in her coat.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.026
Miranda Cole.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.127
Pupils reactive to light.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.929
Pulse 110.
Couldn't get her temp.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.064
Almost bit my finger off.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.766
Are you taking
any medications, Miranda?

11:38.799 --> 11:39.466
Get away.
I'm not going.

11:39.499 --> 11:40.467
Get Dr. Hendrix.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.468
Rebecca Hendrix?

11:41.501 --> 11:43.270
Yeah.
Miranda?

11:43.303 --> 11:44.271
Who's Rebecca Hendrix?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.272
She used to be a cop.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.339
Miranda, listen to me.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.507
Is there anyone
we can call for you?

11:47.540 --> 11:50.911
No no no no
no no no.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.379
Blood glucose,
tox screen,

11:52.412 --> 11:53.413
blood alcohol,

11:53.446 --> 11:55.082
pregnancy test.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.417
Give her two migs
of Ativan I-M,
Stop!

11:57.450 --> 11:59.820
Stop!
20 of Geodon,

11:59.853 --> 12:01.421
two of Cogentin.
Hey.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.990
Hey, Olivia.
Hi.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.124
She may have been
sexually assaulted.

12:08.461 --> 12:13.901
Miranda, are you hearing
voices right now?

12:13.934 --> 12:14.902
Mm-hmm.

12:14.935 --> 12:15.903
Yeah.

12:15.936 --> 12:16.970
What are they saying?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.275
It's my fault.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.078
I brought this on.

12:25.112 --> 12:28.515
What's your fault?

12:28.548 --> 12:30.050
Miranda,

12:30.083 --> 12:32.319
do you believe people
want to harm you?

12:32.352 --> 12:36.456
Terrorists.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.158
Why?

12:38.191 --> 12:40.961
Bin Laden wants to--

12:40.994 --> 12:42.362
hide it in plain sight,

12:42.395 --> 12:43.363
but I can see.

12:43.396 --> 12:46.333
Miranda,
when were you attacked?

12:46.366 --> 12:49.937
Yesterday.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.138
I have to leave now.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.373
Oh, Miranda, no.
It's okay.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.108
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.276
Won't you lie back?

12:56.309 --> 12:58.545
And we're gonna
examine you, okay?

12:58.578 --> 13:00.313
They wanna stop me.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.949
They can get into my mind.

13:01.982 --> 13:02.782
(Benson)
Miranda, can you

13:02.816 --> 13:05.052
describe the person
that attacked you?

13:05.085 --> 13:06.586
What are those?

13:06.619 --> 13:07.587
The nurse just wants
to make sure

13:07.620 --> 13:08.588
you're not injured,
Miranda.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.824
I know what they are.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.459
Don't put anything else
in me!

13:12.492 --> 13:14.327
Miranda, is that where
he touched you?

13:14.361 --> 13:15.863
No no no no
no no no!

13:15.896 --> 13:17.865
No more listening devices.
Okay.

13:17.898 --> 13:18.866
I know the procedure.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.167
It's the pattern.
Stop!

13:20.200 --> 13:21.835
Nurse.

13:21.869 --> 13:22.502
Start her on five migs

13:22.535 --> 13:24.137
of Zyprexa B-I-D.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.538
No no no no no no no.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.374
Let's talk outside.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.842
Stop stop stop stop.

13:32.445 --> 13:33.613
What'd she say?

13:33.646 --> 13:34.848
Well, as far
as I can figure,

13:34.882 --> 13:36.183
she was raped by terrorists.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.150
She's schizophrenic.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.486
She's probably been
off her meds for a while.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.354
We're gonna try some
anti-psychotics.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.924
Hopefully she'll be able
to tell you more later.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.293
It was great
to see you, Olivia.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.594
Well, what about
the rape kit?

13:47.627 --> 13:49.096
You saw her.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.031
It's too traumatic.
It'll have to wait.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.233
Well, do you think
she was raped?

13:53.266 --> 13:56.203
Schizophrenics rarely false
report sexual assaults.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.239
And stress often precipitates
a psychotic break.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.942
Rebecca, I'm sure
that you can appreciate

14:01.975 --> 14:03.110
the importance
of getting this done fast.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.344
Stabler.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.913
Our guy attacked three women
in one night,

14:05.946 --> 14:07.614
and if Miranda
is the fourth,

14:07.647 --> 14:08.581
then any forensic
evidence we have

14:08.615 --> 14:10.050
is degrading as we speak.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.551
I get it,
but my priority now

14:11.584 --> 14:12.552
isn't the case.

14:12.585 --> 14:13.553
It's the patient.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.554
Who thinks that you're

14:14.587 --> 14:16.089
implanting listening
devices

14:16.123 --> 14:17.290
into her body.

14:17.324 --> 14:19.026
That's not gonna change
in 24 hours.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.660
She's still gonna be
mentally ill,

14:20.693 --> 14:21.661
and by then,
we could have

14:21.694 --> 14:22.662
more victims on our hands.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.131
(Stabler)
We may not have

14:24.164 --> 14:24.965
to wait that long.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.170
(Uni)
Victim's Lori Switzer,

14:30.203 --> 14:32.505
24, closing up shop
by herself.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.541
Dad called us
when she didn't come home.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.243
Dispatch said this is
the same neighborhood

14:36.276 --> 14:37.544
as your other
three incidents?

14:37.577 --> 14:38.912
Yeah.
Same neighborhood.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.547
Different outcome.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.482
I was hoping your guy
would keep me out of this.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.550
(Benson)
We sure it's him?

14:43.583 --> 14:44.651
Best I can tell.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.086
She was raped from behind.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.087
Looks like
fingerprint bruising

14:47.120 --> 14:48.922
on the nape of the neck

14:48.956 --> 14:50.257
where he held her down.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.558
She struggled,
so he put his weight into it,

14:51.591 --> 14:54.995
snapped her neck.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.229
Defensive wounds

14:56.263 --> 14:57.230
and offensive wounds.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.631
She fought hard.

14:58.665 --> 15:01.034
Doesn't look like
we've got any fluids.

15:01.068 --> 15:01.801
I'm guessing
he used a condom.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.236
I'll try to get
something for you

15:03.270 --> 15:04.237
from under
the fingernails,

15:04.271 --> 15:05.672
but she kept 'em short.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.407
Does it appear that she has
any physical disability?

15:07.440 --> 15:08.308
Not that I can tell,

15:08.341 --> 15:10.210
but if I find anything,
I'll let you know.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.545
He's evolving.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.547
Getting more comfortable
and more violent.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.017
Doesn't need his victim
to be vulnerable anymore.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.651
Doesn't need her
to survive, either.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.187
This is ridiculous.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.055
We have a living victim
in the hospital

15:22.089 --> 15:24.457
who might've seen this guy,
and we can't talk to her.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.626
The doc says
it's too traumatic.
It's always traumatic.

15:26.659 --> 15:27.627
But we need access
to the victims

15:27.660 --> 15:29.262
to prevent future ones.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.064
So why don't you ask Hendrix
to cut us some slack?

15:31.098 --> 15:32.499
She's your friend.

15:32.532 --> 15:35.168
She's a cop.
She's a former cop.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.436
We went to
the academy together,

15:36.469 --> 15:37.971
and then two years later,
she decides

15:38.005 --> 15:38.671
that her time
is better spent

15:38.705 --> 15:40.107
shrinking heads.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.574
So, I seriously doubt

15:41.608 --> 15:42.976
that she remembers
what we're up against.

15:43.010 --> 15:43.710
Then we should remind her.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.548
(Benson)
Rebecca.

15:48.581 --> 15:49.716
We need to talk to Miranda

15:49.749 --> 15:51.251
and I need that rape kit now.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.552
Well, it's already done.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.121
It's at your crime lab.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.422
I was just
about to call you.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.523
Wow.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.291
Finally a shrink
who gets it.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.759
I wish all you guys
were cops.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.428
Look, I hope
they find something.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.064
I don't want to make
your jobs any harder.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.000
Miranda's responding well
to the anti-psychotics.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.301
You can interview her
whenever you like.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.469
Great.
Where is she?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.238
Um, she's--

16:11.271 --> 16:13.140
She's aware
of her illness.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.541
Um, she's self-conscious

16:14.574 --> 16:16.409
about how her delusions
sound to others,

16:16.443 --> 16:17.777
but she believes
they're real.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.246
She thinks
she can predict

16:19.279 --> 16:20.347
the next terror attack

16:20.380 --> 16:22.515
by analyzing
molecular diagrams.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.051
Did she say anything
about her rape?

16:24.084 --> 16:25.518
No, she's not gonna
talk about that.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.587
Look, I have to warn you

16:27.620 --> 16:29.089
about posttraumatic stress

16:29.122 --> 16:30.257
in schizophrenic patients.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.558
We understand PTSD.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.293
I know you do.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.262
But Miranda doesn't
just have flashbacks.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.430
She will relive
the experience

16:37.464 --> 16:38.431
when she talks
about it.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.267
The sounds,
the sensations

16:40.300 --> 16:41.701
all come back so vividly,

16:41.734 --> 16:43.603
they seem real.

16:43.636 --> 16:44.804
Look, if you want,

16:44.837 --> 16:46.173
I can sit in
to facilitate.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.640
I got time now.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.709
Sounds good to me.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.478
Fine.
Let's go.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.580
Miranda.

16:53.613 --> 16:54.614
Do you remember coming

16:54.647 --> 16:56.549
to the police station
last night?

16:56.583 --> 17:01.254
Sort of.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.423
Why did you come in?

17:07.460 --> 17:10.063
Something happened to me.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.302
I know you don't
believe me.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.837
Miranda, we believe
that somebody hurt you.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.207
What did he do
to you?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.179
He read my mind.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.815
I couldn't stop him.

17:28.848 --> 17:30.850
What does he look like?

17:30.883 --> 17:32.852
He controls

17:32.885 --> 17:35.655
my eyes, so I can't see.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.124
He teleports,

17:37.157 --> 17:39.726
so he's always
behind me.

17:39.759 --> 17:43.696
I can hear him.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.699
"Don't scream,

17:46.733 --> 17:49.102
or I'll kill you."

17:49.136 --> 17:51.671
He communicates through

17:51.704 --> 17:54.341
the lights.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.842
Someone in Pakistan

17:55.875 --> 17:58.211
tells him

17:58.245 --> 18:00.513
how to do it.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.282
Miranda.

18:02.315 --> 18:05.785
Miranda, is this the man
that raped you?

18:05.818 --> 18:08.321
[grunts and moans]

18:13.193 --> 18:14.627
Miranda, stop.

18:14.661 --> 18:17.464
It's okay.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.133
You don't have
to say any more.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.243
(Cragen)
So we don't know
if she was raped.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.145
She said something about
the man standing behind her.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.247
All the victims
were raped from behind.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.149
That a coincidence?
Cragen.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.251
Hendrix also said
that schizophrenics

18:38.285 --> 18:40.187
often incorporate details
that they've heard

18:40.220 --> 18:41.654
in the media
into their delusions.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.690
I mean, these attacks have been
all over the news.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.458
But she found her way
to our unit.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.459
Look, let's be honest.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.527
She's the only thing we got.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.661
She's on 24-hour hold.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.730
Let's try again
when she's more stable.

18:50.763 --> 18:51.898
Lab found semen

18:51.931 --> 18:52.932
in Miranda's rape kit.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.634
And they got a match.

18:57.870 --> 19:02.575
(Benson)
Raymond Ettinger.

19:02.609 --> 19:03.910
You've got spiders
in your eyes!

19:03.943 --> 19:05.612
Arachnids!

19:05.645 --> 19:08.348
You are not
a real person!

19:08.381 --> 19:09.816
You'll turn me into
a broken glass.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.418
Fireplug!
Don't be a werewolf.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.485
Don't be a werewolf.
Don't be a werewolf.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.953
Don't be a werewolf!

19:13.986 --> 19:15.388
You're under arrest

19:15.422 --> 19:17.290
for the rape
of Miranda Cole.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.391
Shut up.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.793
Don't hurt him.
He can't help it.

19:20.827 --> 19:21.961
Well, uh, there's a key.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.230
Actually,
it's not really a key.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.297
It's--it's made of hair.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.465
Of follicles, you know,
but I mean,

19:25.498 --> 19:27.900
I could look at a point on the
wall and crawl right inside.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.436
I mean, actually, that's the--
that's only sometimes.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.970
Sometimes, it's too sticky,
but, you know,

19:31.003 --> 19:32.339
he is not my friend.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.673
Oh, not at all.
No, sir.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.742
I mean, actually,
there's something over us,

19:35.775 --> 19:37.277
inside the air.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.512
It's, uh,
very funny, actually.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.980
I-I was talking, you know,
at "inappropriate" times.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.850
You know, my mom says,
"Oh, it's better to use the
pencil, not the crayon."

19:43.883 --> 19:46.286
But I actually think red isn't
the color of blood anymore.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.987
I mean,
everything is different.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.589
You guys

19:49.622 --> 19:51.658
have really changed.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.326
You should think
about that.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.299
Actually, you know, it's only
when I eat the crust.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.867
And the--the center
falls out

20:00.900 --> 20:02.435
right in the middle
of the world.

20:02.469 --> 20:05.405
And goats actually had
strings on their toes,

20:05.438 --> 20:09.276
but it was Julie Andrews
singing.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.544
No, Ray-Ray.

20:11.578 --> 20:12.745
Who's "Ray-Ray"?

20:12.779 --> 20:15.348
He's a frequent flier
at Bellevue.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.750
He and Miranda
must've had sex in the ward.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.352
He was discharged
this morning.

20:19.386 --> 20:20.953
You sure the sex
was consensual?

20:20.987 --> 20:23.022
Unfortunately,
it happens all the time

20:23.055 --> 20:24.257
at the hospital.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.958
And Ray-Ray is not
a rapist.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.495
His DNA is in the system
for filing

20:28.528 --> 20:30.530
hundreds of false reports
about his neighbor

20:30.563 --> 20:31.931
trying to murder
his cat.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.366
I don't believe this.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.601
Well, look,
as far as Miranda's concerned,

20:34.634 --> 20:35.602
this is good news.

20:35.635 --> 20:36.469
She wasn't raped.

20:36.503 --> 20:39.739
I talked to her, Olivia.
I think she was.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.808
The rape kit didn't find
any evidence of spermicide,

20:41.841 --> 20:43.710
which was present in the other
two victims that were raped,

20:43.743 --> 20:46.413
and the only semen
belonged to Ray-Ray.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.281
Which only means she wasn't
raped last night.

20:48.315 --> 20:51.351
Schizophrenics often lose
perception of time.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.485
Something that happened
a week ago

20:52.519 --> 20:53.753
they'll say
happened yesterday.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.921
And she does fit
the perp's criteria.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.389
You find a victim

20:56.423 --> 20:58.057
who has a disability
and exploit it.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.427
A schizo off her meds.

21:00.460 --> 21:01.561
Seems like the perfect target.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.762
Schizophrenics
are twice

21:02.795 --> 21:04.564
as likely
as the general population

21:04.597 --> 21:05.932
to be sexually assaulted.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.435
Statistics aren't gonna tell me
when she was raped.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.436
(Ray)
Hello!

21:09.469 --> 21:12.972
Uh, I can't find my head.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.777
Let's bring Ray-Ray
back to Bellevue

21:17.810 --> 21:18.711
and ask Miranda.

21:21.381 --> 21:24.384
Oh, Cathy,
is Miranda Cole awake?

21:24.417 --> 21:25.952
She checked herself out,
Dr. Hendrix.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.687
When?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.021
Couple hours ago.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.624
Soon as the 24-hour hold
expired.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.664
No luck?

21:37.697 --> 21:38.731
In the wind.

21:38.765 --> 21:39.832
Where does she live?

21:39.866 --> 21:41.000
She wouldn't tell me.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.535
I doubt she has
a permanent address.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.003
Then she should have been
kept in the hospital.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.338
We can't force her.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.739
She's allowed
to check herself out,

21:46.773 --> 21:48.408
unless a court
compels her to stay.

21:48.441 --> 21:49.809
This is exactly
the problem

21:49.842 --> 21:51.611
with the mental health
profession.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.414
You medicate them just enough
so you can cut them loose,

21:54.447 --> 21:55.848
and then
nobody monitors them.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.717
They go off their meds,
and the next thing you know,

21:57.750 --> 21:58.918
they either become
the victim of a crime

21:58.951 --> 22:00.119
or they commit one.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.622
Either way, we have
to clean up your mess.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.624
So, what, we lock them up
to make your life easier?

22:04.657 --> 22:05.625
Is that your solution?

22:05.658 --> 22:07.594
If it keeps them safe, yes.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.929
I left the job because
I got sick of locking them up.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.432
I'd rather treat the criminals
and help the victims.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.766
Do you think Miranda's
being helped right now

22:13.800 --> 22:14.767
on the street?

22:14.801 --> 22:16.469
I think we all can agree

22:16.503 --> 22:18.037
the answer to that
is no.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.606
So let's find her.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.073
Any relatives?

22:21.107 --> 22:22.675
She mentioned a sister.

22:22.709 --> 22:23.943
I'll check her old
medical records,

22:23.976 --> 22:25.111
see if I can find
a contact number.

22:25.144 --> 22:27.547
Check public records too.

22:27.580 --> 22:28.981
Where are you going?

22:29.015 --> 22:30.650
To work.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.685
We're gonna need a shrink
if we find Miranda.

22:32.719 --> 22:35.422
She trusts you.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.091
I already have a job.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.460
So what are you
doing here?

22:40.493 --> 22:42.495
You may not be
a cop anymore,

22:42.529 --> 22:43.730
but I know you want
to find this guy

22:43.763 --> 22:45.097
as badly as we do.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.971
Miranda got sick
not long after this was taken,

22:52.004 --> 22:56.809
but back then, I thought
she could do anything.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.778
Her junior year in college,
she got an internship

22:58.811 --> 23:00.880
with a senator in DC.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.048
That's when
she started telling us

23:02.081 --> 23:03.916
the Soviets were
bugging her phone.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.453
Now it's terrorists.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.020
When was the last time
you saw your sister?

23:08.054 --> 23:10.823
She called four days ago.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.892
She was pretty bad.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.595
She say anything about
somebody trying to attack her?

23:15.628 --> 23:18.465
She was rambling about
a man who tried to kill her.

23:18.498 --> 23:21.000
Someone's always
trying to kill her.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.703
He hurt her inside,
she said.

23:25.171 --> 23:27.073
God, if I had
known it was true--

23:27.106 --> 23:28.675
There's no way
you could have known.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.611
You can't help your sister
if she refuses to be helped.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.780
You have any idea
where she might go?

23:33.813 --> 23:36.115
I bought her an apartment
with the inheritance

23:36.148 --> 23:38.718
after our mother died,
but...

23:38.751 --> 23:40.920
she rarely stays there
anymore.

23:40.953 --> 23:41.988
Where is it?

23:42.021 --> 23:43.556
Upper West Side.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.891
Near the park.

23:44.924 --> 23:48.027
And near the other rapes.

23:52.565 --> 23:53.900
Miranda?

23:53.933 --> 23:56.002
It's Dr. Hendrix.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.970
She covered
all the windows.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.674
There's not a lamp
anywhere.

24:01.708 --> 24:04.477
She said they communicate
through the lights.

24:07.747 --> 24:10.216
Look at this...
soda can tops.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.551
There must be thousands
of them.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.786
(Hendrix)
She probably uses them
for protection.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.022
Protection
against what?

24:16.055 --> 24:18.157
Surveillance,
mind reading.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.026
Chemical weapons.

24:20.059 --> 24:23.029
The World Trade Center.
U.S.S. Cole.

24:23.062 --> 24:26.666
It looks like every plane crash
from the past decade.

24:26.699 --> 24:27.700
What does
all this mean?

24:27.734 --> 24:29.836
It only makes sense
to her.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.672
She fixates on molecules
and terrorism.

24:32.705 --> 24:36.509
Others fixate on the devil
or Jesus or aliens

24:36.543 --> 24:37.476
or the F.B.I.

24:37.510 --> 24:39.912
[pounding]
(Stabler)
God, what a way to live.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.556
Miranda?

24:49.589 --> 24:51.658
(mumbling)
I'm blocking you.
I'm blocking you.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.125
I'm blocking you.
I'm blocking you.

24:54.727 --> 24:58.264
Blocking! Blocking!
Blocking! Blocking!

24:58.297 --> 25:00.567
I'm blocking you!
I'm blocking you!

25:00.600 --> 25:02.635
Miranda.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.303
Blocking you!
Blocking you!

25:04.336 --> 25:06.739
Miranda, it's Dr. Hendrix.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.910
Remember how we talked
about you taking your meds

25:10.943 --> 25:12.745
so you wouldn't
be afraid?

25:12.779 --> 25:14.581
It's not safe.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.683
It is now.

25:16.716 --> 25:17.950
Can you come out?

25:17.984 --> 25:20.019
I've been blocking him,

25:20.052 --> 25:20.853
and he's come in anyway.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.021
It's not safe!

25:22.054 --> 25:23.856
Who came in?

25:23.890 --> 25:26.192
Three, and then four!

25:29.596 --> 25:31.030
Kitchen is wired.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.933
Three and then four.

25:33.966 --> 25:36.102
Four victims.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.870
It's not safe.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.148
Pants and underwear,
Miranda's.

25:49.181 --> 25:51.584
She was raped here.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.252
And she preserved
the crime scene.

25:57.890 --> 26:02.028
"Say it.
Say...you like it.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.896
Or I'll hit you!"

26:03.930 --> 26:05.698
"Tell me what's wrong.

26:05.732 --> 26:08.067
"Tell me I'm a man.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.368
The best man
you've ever had."

26:09.401 --> 26:11.303
Miranda,
what's happening?

26:11.337 --> 26:13.172
What is he
doing to you now?

26:13.205 --> 26:16.843
Something is inside.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.277
He is!

26:18.310 --> 26:23.750
He hears from the--
the inside out.

26:23.783 --> 26:27.153
He--he has, uh...

26:27.186 --> 26:29.221
a disguise
over his eyes.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.322
Sunglasses.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.124
His head
is made of bugs.

26:32.158 --> 26:33.760
He left one here...

26:33.793 --> 26:35.862
to spy on me.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.634
This is blood.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.936
"Say it feels good!"

26:43.970 --> 26:45.004
Say my name!

26:45.037 --> 26:46.873
Say Thomas!

26:51.711 --> 26:53.913
(Hendrix)
C-come on.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.382
We pulled every Ford Taurus
matching this description

26:56.415 --> 26:58.084
registered to a Thomas
in five boroughs,

26:58.117 --> 26:59.251
about 150 of them.

26:59.285 --> 27:02.021
Anybody got a rap sheet?

27:02.054 --> 27:03.422
Well, three
with violent priors.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.857
No sex offenses.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.225
But only one lives
in the middle

27:06.258 --> 27:07.126
of all the rape
activity.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.327
Thomas Mathers,

27:08.360 --> 27:09.929
a part-time
data entry clerk

27:09.962 --> 27:11.363
for an insurance company.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.899
No record.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.266
The blood
in Miranda's kitchen

27:14.300 --> 27:16.769
was a match to the blood
on Gina Kownacki's crutch.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.404
Then, assuming Miranda's
name recall is sound,

27:18.437 --> 27:19.906
we got a suspect.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.774
Olivia, run a background
check on Mathers.

27:21.808 --> 27:25.077
See if M.E. Warner's free
to make a house call.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.313
And use your powers
of persuasion

27:27.346 --> 27:29.849
to get Thomas
to volunteer a DNA sample.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.356
[pounds on door]

27:37.389 --> 27:39.759
Thomas Mathers, police!
Open up!

27:44.764 --> 27:46.098
You're not Thomas Mathers.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.835
No, Alan Richter.
What's wrong?

27:48.868 --> 27:50.469
Where is he?

27:50.502 --> 27:53.005
He's indisposed.
What--what's going on?

27:53.039 --> 27:54.273
Alan...

27:54.306 --> 27:56.108
You mind if we
talk inside?

27:56.142 --> 27:59.245
Yeah, all right.
Come in.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.281
Hi.

28:02.314 --> 28:03.850
Thomas is your roommate?

28:03.883 --> 28:07.419
Uh, yeah.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.388
Who's she?

28:09.421 --> 28:12.058
Dr. Melinda Warner.
I'm the medical examiner.

28:12.091 --> 28:14.293
Somebody die?

28:14.326 --> 28:15.862
You could say that.
Either one of you smoke?

28:15.895 --> 28:17.363
I quit a year ago.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.398
Thomas hates it.

28:19.431 --> 28:22.201
Hey, Al, do me a favor.
Get dressed.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.736
We'll wait
for Thomas out here.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.075
(Fin)
Hey, Elliot,
check this out.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.113
Roommates,
but one bedroom?

28:34.146 --> 28:35.081
This guy's gay?

28:35.114 --> 28:36.816
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.985
It's a damn shame.

28:39.018 --> 28:41.854
Can you tell me why
you want to talk to Thomas?

28:41.888 --> 28:44.156
We're investigating
a series of sexual assaults

28:44.190 --> 28:45.457
on women
in your neighborhood.

28:45.491 --> 28:49.862
And you think
that he did it?

28:49.896 --> 28:53.232
(Fin)
Not necessarily.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.167
W-what's going on?

28:55.201 --> 28:57.870
They think you
attacked some women.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.939
No, we just want to ask you
some questions, Thomas.

28:59.972 --> 29:01.808
You still drive
a Ford Taurus?

29:01.841 --> 29:05.812
Yeah. Um, I'm sorry.
Who was attacked?

29:05.845 --> 29:07.079
Can you account for your
whereabouts three nights ago?

29:09.081 --> 29:10.149
Thomas, come on.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.852
He was here.
We went to bed at 10:00.

29:12.885 --> 29:15.254
Alan, why don't
you broadcast it.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.256
They're
investigating crimes.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.158
You can't come out
of the closet for that?

29:19.191 --> 29:20.993
Hon, it's okay.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.962
Stop it.

29:22.995 --> 29:23.996
I told you.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.998
Hey, Thomas,

29:26.032 --> 29:28.300
I need you to answer
these questions yourself.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.535
Now, three nights ago,
where were you?

29:31.337 --> 29:33.072
I--I was here in bed.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.173
In bed alone?

29:34.206 --> 29:37.143
With Alan, okay?

29:37.176 --> 29:38.377
See? Easy.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.146
Now just give us
a DNA sample.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.114
We'll clear it all up.
We'll get out of your hair.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.053
No.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.220
No?

29:48.254 --> 29:49.889
I don't want to.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.390
They're not gonna
catalog it as homo blood.

29:51.423 --> 29:54.060
No blood.

29:54.093 --> 29:56.829
Just a swab in the mouth.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.034
I want to put a rush
on Mathers' DNA,

30:02.068 --> 30:03.469
but it's a good bet
he's not our guy.

30:03.502 --> 30:05.071
Women aren't exactly
his type.

30:05.104 --> 30:07.173
Still doesn't explain
what Olivia and John found.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.540
What's that?

30:08.574 --> 30:11.010
Trouble. Seems to follow Thomas
wherever he goes.

30:11.043 --> 30:14.180
During the 6 1/2 years
he attended Michigan State,

30:14.213 --> 30:16.282
there was a rash
of unsolved peeping incidents

30:16.315 --> 30:17.884
all over East Lansing.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.485
Don't tell me they stopped
when he graduated.

30:19.518 --> 30:20.887
Yeah, it also stopped

30:20.920 --> 30:22.288
when he took
three extended medical leaves.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.090
No peeping reported
during those times.

30:24.123 --> 30:25.858
Then he moved to Cleveland
for two years,

30:25.892 --> 30:27.493
where their P.D. reported
several unsolved

30:27.526 --> 30:29.095
breaking and entering
incidents.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.430
Female victims,
nothing missing.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.465
He was in training
for rape and murder.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.634
Boyfriend alibied him.
Home in bed all night.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.636
Then the boyfriend's either
a liar or a heavy sleeper,

30:37.669 --> 30:39.405
because the night
that Colleen,

30:39.438 --> 30:41.040
Samantha,
and Gina were attacked,

30:41.073 --> 30:43.009
Thomas' cell phone
received an incoming call

30:43.042 --> 30:45.244
at 10:00 p.m.
from his mother in Queens.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.579
Now, at midnight, there's
an outgoing call to Mom,

30:47.613 --> 30:50.249
but the cell site use
was in Queens, not Manhattan.

30:50.282 --> 30:51.550
That puts him
at Mom's house,

30:51.583 --> 30:54.020
not in the vicinity
of the rapes.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.654
Colleen wasn't raped
until 2:00 in the morning,

30:55.687 --> 30:58.124
depending on how long
he stayed in Queens.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.926
Plenty of time
to get back in the city.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.427
And visit with mom,
evening of rape.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.095
What would Freud say?

31:03.129 --> 31:04.163
I'd rather ask Mrs. Mathers.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.198
Find out how long
Tommy Boy visited.

31:09.035 --> 31:11.971
Tom didn't tell me
about a car accident.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.906
Witnesses are wrong
all the time, ma'am.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.374
We just want to confirm
his whereabouts

31:15.407 --> 31:16.542
three nights ago.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.344
Maybe it wasn't his car
after all.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.512
You're probably right.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.581
He would never
hit somebody and drive away.

31:22.614 --> 31:25.151
Let me just get off
this telephone call.

31:25.184 --> 31:26.352
[cough]

31:26.385 --> 31:27.353
Does the smoke
bother you?

31:27.386 --> 31:28.554
I can open a window.

31:28.587 --> 31:29.922
Don't worry
about it.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.323
Wouldn't do a damn thing,
anyway.

31:31.357 --> 31:32.925
I can taste it.

31:32.959 --> 31:34.426
We're gonna smell like
an ashtray when we leave.

31:34.460 --> 31:35.494
Just like our rapist.

31:35.527 --> 31:36.395
Three nights ago,
you say.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.430
Yeah, he was here.

31:38.464 --> 31:39.498
What time was that?

31:39.531 --> 31:40.632
Oh, a little
after midnight.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.135
My furnace
broke again.

31:43.169 --> 31:44.636
I don't know what I'm gonna do
with that darn thing.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.472
(Fin)
How long did he stay?

31:46.505 --> 31:48.407
Uh, about 20 minutes.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.176
Tom tried to fix it
that morning too.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.978
But it's still not right.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.379
Let me take a look
at it, Mrs. Mathers.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.380
My uncle
owned a repair shop.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.948
Aren't you sweet?

31:55.982 --> 31:58.217
The basement is right
down those stairs.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.252
It's nice to have your son
help you around the house.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.553
Oh, yeah.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.322
I have to twist his arm
to do it.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.191
He yelled
all the time he was here.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.458
He's got his own life.

32:06.492 --> 32:07.659
He can't drop everything
because of me.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.062
All that nonsense.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.298
Still,
he's a good boy.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.200
What are you doing here?

32:14.233 --> 32:15.667
Just getting some straight
answers out of your mom, Tommy.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.403
A lot more than we got
out of you.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.571
You can't come in
and harass people.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.540
We're just being helpful.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.609
That furnace is a lost cause,
by the way.

32:23.642 --> 32:24.876
Look how dirty
my nails are.

32:24.910 --> 32:27.213
(Fin)
Aw, man, you're gonna
need a manicure.

32:27.246 --> 32:28.314
You know where
you can go?

32:28.347 --> 32:31.350
He can make an appointment
for me down at our station.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.451
Thomas Mathers,
you're under arrest

32:32.484 --> 32:33.352
for the murder
of Lori Switzer.

32:33.385 --> 32:34.987
What are you...

32:35.021 --> 32:36.055
You have the right
to remain silent.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.626
So we're thinking
the gay thing is a cover?

32:40.659 --> 32:41.727
It's pretty elaborate.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.029
He's been living
with that guy

32:43.062 --> 32:44.396
for over a year.

32:44.430 --> 32:46.198
A homosexual rapist
is new to me,

32:46.232 --> 32:47.699
but it's not impossible.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.235
Rape isn't about
sexual attraction.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.137
It's about power.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.172
Most men would be too difficult
for him to control,

32:53.205 --> 32:55.374
so women
make better victims.
[door opens]

32:55.407 --> 32:57.643
Regretting
the career change, Doc?

32:57.676 --> 33:00.146
Elliot asked me
to stop by.

33:00.179 --> 33:02.248
Why would a homosexual man
rape women?

33:02.281 --> 33:04.583
Uh, well...

33:04.616 --> 33:08.420
I guess for the same reason
a heterosexual man does.

33:08.454 --> 33:10.689
Um, I'd have to know more
about his psychopathology.

33:10.722 --> 33:13.659
Why don't you sit in
on the interrogation.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.694
Wouldn't be a bad idea
to have a shrink in there,

33:15.727 --> 33:16.762
help us figure
this guy out.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.230
Since when are you
such a champion

33:18.264 --> 33:19.298
of the mental
health profession?

33:19.331 --> 33:20.166
You just said it
yourself, Liv.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.567
This is new to us.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.602
I agree.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.104
He's already rattled.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.173
Three of you should be able
to get in his head.

33:27.206 --> 33:30.109
This is Dr. Hendrix.

33:30.142 --> 33:31.777
Detective Benson.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.046
Me, you know.

33:35.447 --> 33:36.748
I didn't rape anybody.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.151
Thomas, we're gonna have
a hard time believing you,

33:39.185 --> 33:41.653
especially after
you lied to me.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.622
You were
at your mom's house

33:43.655 --> 33:45.557
when you said
you stayed home.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.194
So?
I forgot.

33:48.227 --> 33:49.661
You forgot?

33:49.695 --> 33:51.363
I got confused.
(Stabler)
And so was Alan.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.832
He said
you stayed home too.

33:53.865 --> 33:54.766
Or is he lying?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.568
No, uh,

33:56.602 --> 33:59.505
he had a few drinks,
and he didn't wake up.

33:59.538 --> 34:00.439
Why didn't you
tell your boyfriend

34:00.472 --> 34:01.607
you went
to your mother's?

34:01.640 --> 34:02.708
He's not my boyfriend.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.577
Oh...because
you live with him,

34:05.611 --> 34:07.246
you sleep with him,
you have sex with him.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.081
That is disgusting.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.382
What's disgusting?

34:10.416 --> 34:12.118
That--I don't want
to talk about that stuff.

34:12.151 --> 34:14.286
Now, Tom...

34:14.320 --> 34:16.155
The only person
in this room

34:16.188 --> 34:17.689
who's got a problem
with homosexuals is you.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.391
Get over it.

34:21.227 --> 34:22.628
You're bleeding.

34:24.563 --> 34:27.133
Uh, it's nothing.
I cut myself shaving.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.534
So, Thomas...

34:28.567 --> 34:31.137
Why are you so hung up
about being gay?

34:31.170 --> 34:32.471
From what I hear
from the M.E.,

34:32.504 --> 34:33.705
this Alan is quite a catch.

34:33.739 --> 34:35.541
I'm not gay,
all right?

34:35.574 --> 34:37.243
I'm just c--I'm...

34:37.276 --> 34:39.478
going through a thing.

34:39.511 --> 34:40.746
Have you ever
had a girlfriend?

34:40.779 --> 34:43.249
Lots of guys don't
find the right girl.

34:43.282 --> 34:44.383
That's true,
I mean...

34:44.416 --> 34:46.452
being single's not easy.

34:46.485 --> 34:49.588
You would not look at me
twice if I asked you out.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.657
You would not give me
the time of day,

34:51.690 --> 34:53.292
so don't pretend
you understand

34:53.325 --> 34:55.294
what I'm going through.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.662
I don't need
your pity.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.665
(Stabler)
You're just looking
for the right girl.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.501
And one day you'll rape her
and live happily ever after.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.540
There's no doubt
in my mind he did it.

35:08.574 --> 35:10.609
That guy is the worst liar
I have ever seen.

35:10.642 --> 35:11.877
He's got a built-in
defense--he's gay.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.579
No one disputes that.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.781
He's no different
from any other rapist.

35:15.814 --> 35:19.685
Men like him view all sexuality
as sick and depraved.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.154
Sex is equated
with degradation and violence.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.456
Probably blames women
for making him gay.

35:24.490 --> 35:25.657
Look how he instructed
the victims

35:25.691 --> 35:27.493
to tell him how much
they wanted him--

35:27.526 --> 35:29.328
like if they found him
attractive, he'd be fixed.

35:29.361 --> 35:30.929
Yeah, but ultimately,
his sexual preference

35:30.962 --> 35:32.531
is incidental.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.800
He feels helpless.
He wants control.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.169
He'd be a rapist,
gay or straight.

35:37.203 --> 35:38.237
All right, arrest him.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.271
Belay that.

35:39.305 --> 35:40.806
(Stabler)
Why?

35:40.839 --> 35:42.708
Because he didn't do it.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.276
Warner called.

35:44.310 --> 35:45.744
Thomas Mathers' DNA
didn't match the blood

35:45.777 --> 35:47.546
found at either
crime scene.

35:47.579 --> 35:48.914
Well, could it be
a lab mistake?

35:48.947 --> 35:51.217
She ran it three times.

35:51.250 --> 35:53.485
Cut him loose.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.290
I don't know
what to tell you,

35:58.324 --> 35:59.491
but this is wrong.

35:59.525 --> 36:00.826
Thomas Mathers
is your rapist.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.296
We just got proof
that he's not.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.797
Maybe he worked
with an accomplice.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.566
Elliot, every victim
told us the same story.

36:07.599 --> 36:09.201
One rapist.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.469
Everything else fits.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.571
The car, the smell
of cigarettes,

36:12.604 --> 36:14.406
the dirty nails,
Rebecca's profile.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.275
Which was wrong.
I don't believe it was.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.809
And I can't believe you're
taking a shrink's opinion

36:17.843 --> 36:19.778
over actual facts.

36:19.811 --> 36:20.779
Bye.

36:20.812 --> 36:21.947
We don't even know

36:21.980 --> 36:23.615
that the perp's name
is really Thomas.

36:23.649 --> 36:24.983
What's your problem?

36:25.016 --> 36:26.518
If Miranda is taking
her meds now,

36:26.552 --> 36:27.986
then she's gonna be
more lucid,

36:28.019 --> 36:29.655
and maybe
she remembers something.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.490
I want to talk to her
without Rebecca.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.424
What's your problem?
She's a cop.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.492
That's all
I need to know.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.493
No, Elliot,
she didn't think

36:34.526 --> 36:35.494
being a cop
was good enough,

36:35.527 --> 36:37.763
so she quit.

36:37.796 --> 36:38.830
Is that what this
is about?

36:38.864 --> 36:40.899
Some sort of inferiority
complex?

36:40.932 --> 36:43.001
You know, I get that you're
on the rebound and everything,

36:43.034 --> 36:46.272
but if you could keep it
out of work, that'd be great.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.514
Elliot...

36:55.547 --> 36:56.982
Look, the last thing
I wanna do

36:57.015 --> 36:58.750
is get between you
and your partner.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.018
Don't worry about that.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.521
But something has been
bugging me about Mathers.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.955
The shaving cut
on his neck.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.824
It looked like he hadn't
shaved in at least a day,

37:05.857 --> 37:07.459
so why didn't
the blood clot?

37:07.493 --> 37:10.296
I don't know, but what's that
got to do with the case?

37:10.329 --> 37:12.731
Let's find out.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.366
Both blood samples
from the crime scenes

37:14.400 --> 37:15.834
had a low platelet count.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.836
That would make the blood
take longer to clot.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.938
Yep.
What would cause
a low platelet count?

37:19.971 --> 37:21.340
Could be
any number of things.

37:21.373 --> 37:22.908
Disease, drugs.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.577
Do we have enough blood
to do a tox screen?

37:25.611 --> 37:27.679
Yeah, but we have to know
what drug we're looking for.

37:27.713 --> 37:29.781
Mathers took medical leaves
in college, right?

37:29.815 --> 37:31.517
Yeah.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.852
During my ER rotation,
patient came in,

37:33.885 --> 37:35.554
unconscious, some kind
of allergic reaction.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.489
All we had was his name

37:37.523 --> 37:39.758
and the college ring
he was wearing.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.693
I called the school
and got his medical history.

37:41.727 --> 37:43.629
Saved his life.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.364
You want to call
Michigan State

37:45.397 --> 37:46.865
and find out why
Thomas' blood isn't clotting?

37:46.898 --> 37:50.869
I can't.
I'd lose my license.

37:52.671 --> 37:53.972
But Dr. Elliot can.

37:54.005 --> 37:54.873
[chuckles]

37:57.643 --> 38:00.846
(Margo)
Miranda,
Detective Benson's here.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.514
How you doing?

38:02.548 --> 38:04.583
Van der Waals
forces.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.353
The weak,
non-covalent bond.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.621
Oh, the bug
is in the kitchen.

38:09.655 --> 38:11.590
But it's dead.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.425
Evaporating,
vapor and gas,

38:13.459 --> 38:14.760
But that's a lie.

38:14.793 --> 38:18.697
Miranda, remember
when you told me

38:18.730 --> 38:20.599
about what happened
in the kitchen?

38:20.632 --> 38:22.568
It's not
in the bonds.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.069
Was there only one man,
or were there two?

38:24.102 --> 38:26.672
But I know,
I know what to do.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.674
Do you want me
to call Dr. Hendrix?

38:28.707 --> 38:30.676
He can teleport
with cobalt

38:30.709 --> 38:33.011
and three atoms
plus one.

38:34.946 --> 38:37.716
He found them
in the library.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.951
He's made of books
in my hand.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.988
Miranda, did you
see him in the library?

38:43.021 --> 38:45.891
Is that where the terrorist
followed you from?

38:48.059 --> 38:50.596
He was changing
all the words.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.598
He burned it up
without fire.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.533
Can you show me
where you saw him?

39:06.111 --> 39:07.846
Miranda?

39:09.415 --> 39:11.983
Is this where
the terrorist was?

39:12.017 --> 39:15.521
Uh, he was pretending to...

39:15.554 --> 39:17.656
read,
but I knew that he

39:17.689 --> 39:19.791
was recording
my thoughts.

39:19.825 --> 39:23.529
And he sent them
to Afghanistan.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.363
Where was he standing?

39:29.635 --> 39:30.936
Here?

39:30.969 --> 39:32.838
Was he standing
right here?

39:35.206 --> 39:38.677
Principles
of Particle Physics.

39:55.126 --> 39:57.529
He was reading this book?

39:57.563 --> 39:59.531
They record you

39:59.565 --> 40:02.701
and steal the inside parts
of your brains.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.069
It's because of the,
um, waves.

40:04.102 --> 40:07.038
The oxygen
and the hydrogen.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.908
I, um, I'm blocking it now.
I'm blocking.

40:09.941 --> 40:13.011
Miranda...

40:13.044 --> 40:15.547
I need you to promise

40:15.581 --> 40:18.517
you'll take
your medication.

40:18.550 --> 40:21.920
It will make the terrorists
go away.

40:21.953 --> 40:23.989
Will you promise me that?

40:31.663 --> 40:33.899
They're recording you too.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.047
Hey...

40:49.080 --> 40:50.616
His blood
isn't his blood.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.818
What?
We know why
his DNA didn't match.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.152
Thomas had leukemia.

40:54.185 --> 40:56.154
In college,
his bone marrow
was ablated

40:56.187 --> 40:57.956
and replaced
with donor marrow.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.224
From that point on,
the blood he produced

40:59.257 --> 41:01.059
had different DNA
from the rest of his body.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.661
We only took
a cheek swab.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.596
He knew that the blood would
never match the crime scene.

41:04.630 --> 41:05.864
This is unbelievable.

41:05.897 --> 41:06.998
The problem is

41:07.032 --> 41:08.600
the information
wasn't exactly obtained

41:08.634 --> 41:09.868
on the up and up.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.170
Sure it was--
reasonable deception.

41:12.203 --> 41:13.872
It's thin,
and still not enough

41:13.905 --> 41:15.273
to get a blood warrant
to retest him.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.909
This is.

41:17.943 --> 41:20.145
Thomas stalked Miranda--

41:20.178 --> 41:22.514
and this time,
he forgot his shades.

41:25.884 --> 41:29.621
Counselor, I'm denying
the request for bail.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.623
Mr. Mathers,
you're hereby remanded

41:31.657 --> 41:32.791
to the custody
of the court

41:32.824 --> 41:34.526
pending disposition
of this case.

41:34.560 --> 41:35.661
We're adjourned.

41:49.575 --> 41:52.010
Hey.

41:52.043 --> 41:54.512
Miranda Cole is dead.

41:56.114 --> 41:57.983
What?

41:58.016 --> 42:00.218
She committed suicide,
Olivia.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.020
Margo found her
this morning.

42:02.053 --> 42:03.789
I wanted to tell you
so you didn't have to hear it

42:03.822 --> 42:05.591
from somebody else.

42:11.296 --> 42:14.800
What is this, some sort
of "I told you so" lecture?

42:16.301 --> 42:18.970
Her death had nothing
to do with you.

42:19.004 --> 42:22.007
The disease killed her--
the voices in her head

42:22.040 --> 42:24.142
that have been telling her
to do this for years.

42:24.175 --> 42:29.648
The voices that got louder
after she was raped.

42:29.681 --> 42:32.217
You can't save everyone,
Olivia.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.722
I'm sorry.

43:24.670 --> 43:26.905
[wolf howling]
