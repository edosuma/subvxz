08:17.414 --> 08:19.374
This is very important business.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.374
It's very critical.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.209
You cut against the grain,

08:19.416 --> 08:21.209
they pop a cowlick.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.961
Bad-a-bing.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.961
Alfalfa city.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.673
Fine, I-I'd love to see

08:24.796 --> 08:26.673
the master at work.

08:26.714 --> 08:30.260
Thank you very much.

08:26.714 --> 08:30.260
I'll require complete silence.

08:30.302 --> 08:31.303
And away we go.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.804
Okay, Nicky, come here.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.848
Daddy's gonna cut your hair

08:32.846 --> 08:34.848
just a little bit.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.267
Alright.

08:37.309 --> 08:38.935
I remember when I was a kid

08:38.977 --> 08:40.770
my dad once gave me

08:38.977 --> 08:40.770
such a bad haircut

08:40.812 --> 08:42.605
I had to tell all the kids

08:40.812 --> 08:42.605
in school that

08:42.647 --> 08:43.982
I'd stuck my head

08:42.647 --> 08:43.982
out of the car

08:44.024 --> 08:45.359
at Lion Country Safari.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.487
Would you please..

08:48.528 --> 08:49.654
Sorry.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.157
Thank you.

08:52.199 --> 08:55.118
Okay, Nick,

08:52.199 --> 08:55.118
here we go, my man.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.828
I remember that was

08:55.160 --> 08:56.828
the same exact summer

08:56.870 --> 09:00.540
that I had to wear

08:56.870 --> 09:00.540
Uncle Mort's toupee to camp.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.791
Alright, that's it.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.791
I can't do this.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.877
This is too much pressure.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.337
Jesse, you just

09:03.918 --> 09:05.337
gotta face it.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.088
You're too emotionally involved.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.631
Yeah, you're right.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.342
You know, doctors don't

09:08.673 --> 09:10.342
operate on their own kids

09:10.384 --> 09:11.718
and that's only surgery.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.137
This is haircutting.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.137
It's very important.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.014
Alright, I'm going to call

09:14.179 --> 09:16.014
Joey's Uncle Jasper.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.478
Hey, dad, can we go to

09:19.684 --> 09:21.478
the mall tonight?

09:21.520 --> 09:22.521
Sure.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.147
Can we get frozen yogurt?

09:24.189 --> 09:25.899
I'll even spring

09:24.189 --> 09:25.899
for a waffle cone.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.943
Great, so we'll get frozen

09:25.940 --> 09:28.943
yogurt, get my shoes fixed

09:28.985 --> 09:31.530
get my ears pierced,

09:28.985 --> 09:31.530
and get a new headband.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.908
Whoa, just back that up

09:31.571 --> 09:34.908
a little bit, please?

09:34.949 --> 09:36.159
Get my shoes fixed?

09:36.201 --> 09:37.411
After that.

09:37.452 --> 09:39.829
- Get a new headband?

09:37.452 --> 09:39.829
- Before that.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.706
Oh, you must mean

09:39.871 --> 09:41.706
get my ears pierced.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.624
[gasps]

09:41.748 --> 09:43.624
That's the one.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.211
So, we better get going.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.380
We wanna get

09:46.253 --> 09:48.380
a good parking spot.

09:48.422 --> 09:51.550
Steph, Steph,

09:48.422 --> 09:51.550
you're too young

09:51.591 --> 09:53.385
to get your ears pierced.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.178
But Jennifer

09:53.427 --> 09:55.178
got hers pierced.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.930
Yeah, well, I'm not

09:55.220 --> 09:56.930
Jennifer's father.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.266
But Jennifer

09:56.971 --> 09:59.266
got hers pierced.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.143
You already said that.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.811
No, there are

10:02.185 --> 10:03.811
two Jennifer's.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.231
Four ears,

10:03.853 --> 10:06.231
all pierced.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.525
Look, Steph,

10:06.273 --> 10:08.525
D.J. got her ears pierced

10:08.567 --> 10:09.901
when she got

10:08.567 --> 10:09.901
to Junior high.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.069
And you can get

10:09.943 --> 10:11.069
your ears pierced

10:11.111 --> 10:12.987
when you get

10:11.111 --> 10:12.987
to Junior high.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.697
But I'm not D.J.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.783
Hey, I'm sorry,

10:14.739 --> 10:16.783
but I don't make the rules.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.620
Actually, I do.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.872
Well, it just so happens

10:20.661 --> 10:22.872
I think this is a good one.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.874
You are so unfair.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.376
How am I ever

10:24.916 --> 10:26.376
gonna be cool?

10:26.418 --> 10:28.545
What are you

10:26.418 --> 10:28.545
talking about?

10:28.587 --> 10:31.172
I just bought you those

10:28.587 --> 10:31.172
neat new sunglasses, huh?

10:37.429 --> 10:41.057
Okay, Comet, would you

10:37.429 --> 10:41.057
like one lump or two?

10:41.099 --> 10:43.602
[barks]

10:43.643 --> 10:45.103
Watching your weight.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.868
- Out, Michelle.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.868
- But I have a guest.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.289
Your guest drinks

11:02.120 --> 11:04.289
out of the toilet.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.959
So does yours.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.924
Michelle, Kimmy and I have

11:12.547 --> 11:14.924
something important to do.

11:14.966 --> 11:18.094
Important, well, well, well.

11:19.262 --> 11:20.514
Michelle.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.974
You promised if it's

11:20.555 --> 11:22.974
something important

11:23.016 --> 11:24.892
I get to stay.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.394
Oh, let the runt watch.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.896
I work better

11:26.436 --> 11:28.896
with an audience.

11:28.938 --> 11:32.150
Okay, whatever goes on

11:28.938 --> 11:32.150
in this room is top secret.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.276
Pinkie swear.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.488
Wow, pinkie swear.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.488
This is big.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.868
Okay...park your

11:38.031 --> 11:41.868
lobes right here.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.205
Dad wouldn't take me

11:43.578 --> 11:45.205
to get my ears pierced

11:45.246 --> 11:47.332
so I'm letting Kimmy do it.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.001
Are you nuts?

11:50.043 --> 11:52.753
No, I'm desperate.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.465
Let's rock and roll.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.886
Are you sure you know how

11:58.051 --> 11:59.886
to work that thing?

11:59.927 --> 12:03.306
Hey, do I get

11:59.927 --> 12:03.306
D's in English?

12:03.348 --> 12:07.310
So, partner, I reckon

12:03.348 --> 12:07.310
it's time we put some holes

12:07.352 --> 12:09.396
in them pretty little ears.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.657
[instrumental music]

12:28.747 --> 12:30.833
[blows]

12:30.875 --> 12:32.085
You next, rug rat?

12:32.126 --> 12:34.671
How about a nice nose ring?

12:34.713 --> 12:36.423
I'm out of here.

12:38.341 --> 12:39.342
Good job, Kimmy.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.719
That hardly

12:39.384 --> 12:40.719
hurt at all.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.429
I'm a crack shot.

12:42.470 --> 12:45.181
Before I came over,

12:42.470 --> 12:45.181
I practiced on some cold cuts.

12:47.642 --> 12:50.103
Well, I better take these things

12:47.642 --> 12:50.103
out before dad sees them.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.271
But hold it.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.689
You've to leave

12:51.312 --> 12:52.689
those studs in for

12:52.731 --> 12:54.399
at least six weeks

12:52.731 --> 12:54.399
until your ears heal.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.569
"Six weeks?"

12:57.611 --> 12:59.237
What am I going to do?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.740
I was just gonna wear 'em to

12:59.279 --> 13:01.740
school to impress my friends.

13:01.780 --> 13:02.907
But if I wear them

13:01.780 --> 13:02.907
around here--

13:02.949 --> 13:04.409
[Danny]

13:02.949 --> 13:04.409
'Stephanie.'

13:04.451 --> 13:06.119
I'm dead.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.458
Steph, why is Michelle

13:08.204 --> 13:11.458
afraid to come upstairs?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.126
Oh, Kimmy's here.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.756
Honey, what are you doing?

13:17.796 --> 13:19.758
Sit-ups.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.428
Sweetheart,

13:21.426 --> 13:23.428
you're standing up.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.054
I thought they

13:23.470 --> 13:25.054
were too easy.

13:27.181 --> 13:30.310
One, two, three, four--

13:30.351 --> 13:33.062
- Is everything okay?

13:30.351 --> 13:33.062
- Great, fine.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.981
I'm feeling the burn now.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.317
You guys better

13:35.982 --> 13:37.317
open a window.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.901
I don't think you're

13:37.358 --> 13:38.901
getting enough oxygen.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.954
Whoa, Steph.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.165
Well, that's, that's

13:49.996 --> 13:52.165
an interesting hairdo.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.251
What is that,

13:52.206 --> 13:55.251
the Star Wars look?

13:55.293 --> 13:58.338
Ah, yeah,

13:55.293 --> 13:58.338
we're doing a hairstyles

13:58.379 --> 14:00.214
of the '70s thing

13:58.379 --> 14:00.214
at school today

14:00.256 --> 14:04.302
and, uh, I'm going

14:00.256 --> 14:04.302
as Princess Leia.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.221
I'd feel really bad for that

14:04.344 --> 14:07.221
poor kid who has to go as Kojak.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.101
What's the matter?

14:12.143 --> 14:14.437
My ear is hurting,

14:12.143 --> 14:14.437
they're really red.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.854
I think they're infected.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.274
Oh, no.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.274
Are they gonna fall off?

14:19.567 --> 14:20.901
Of course, not.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.321
Good, because your

14:20.943 --> 14:23.321
head would look funny.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.032
Just drop it, okay?

14:26.073 --> 14:28.326
How would you keep

14:26.073 --> 14:28.326
your glasses on?

14:29.994 --> 14:32.455
I'd glue them

14:29.994 --> 14:32.455
to my nose, okay?

14:34.582 --> 14:37.960
Now, remember, you pinkie swore

14:34.582 --> 14:37.960
that you wouldn't tell dad.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.797
Okay, but if your ears

14:38.002 --> 14:40.797
do fall off

14:40.839 --> 14:42.465
I get your Walkman.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.895
Oh, Jess,

14:52.642 --> 14:55.895
isn't this adorable?

14:59.399 --> 15:00.692
- Jess.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.692
- No, no, no.

15:00.734 --> 15:01.942
Don't let the cute

15:00.734 --> 15:01.942
stuff fool you.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.110
It's still a barber shop

15:01.984 --> 15:03.110
which means

15:03.152 --> 15:05.655
there's potential

15:03.152 --> 15:05.655
for danger.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.449
Oh, hello.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.412
Hi. Welcome to Jasper's

15:10.159 --> 15:12.412
Kiddie Kuts.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.538
I'm Jasper.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.122
Oh, hi, I'm Rebecca.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.332
This is my husband, Jesse.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.209
And these are our boys,

15:16.374 --> 15:18.209
Nicky and Alex.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.421
Yeah, I know. My nephew, Joey,

15:18.251 --> 15:21.421
told me you were coming in.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.840
Oh, look at this,

15:21.462 --> 15:23.840
a doubleheader.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.675
This calls for Big Bertha.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.597
That's it. We're out of here.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.597
Come on, Beck, let's go.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.306
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

15:30.638 --> 15:32.306
don't worry about it.

15:32.348 --> 15:34.141
It's just a toy.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.727
[metal clanks]

15:37.395 --> 15:41.232
This guy's about two grapes

15:37.395 --> 15:41.232
short of a fruit salad.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.901
Honey, it's Joey's uncle.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.236
My point, exactly.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.236
Let's get out of here.

15:47.154 --> 15:50.199
Okay, now, let's get some

15:47.154 --> 15:50.199
hair on the floor.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.534
Hey, hold on a second.

15:51.576 --> 15:52.869
Now before we get any

15:51.576 --> 15:52.869
hair on the floor

15:52.911 --> 15:54.579
I've got to ask you

15:52.911 --> 15:54.579
a few questions.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.832
Oh, honey, please.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.832
Just let the man do his job.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.751
Yeah, just let the man

15:57.874 --> 15:59.751
do his job, honey.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.669
No, no, you're not

15:59.793 --> 16:01.669
doing any job yet.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.421
Now, listen. I gotta ask

16:01.711 --> 16:03.421
you a few questions.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.423
Where did you get

16:03.463 --> 16:05.423
your training from?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.258
I went to Stanford.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.552
Stanford.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.552
That's very impressive.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.764
Yep. Al Stanford's

16:09.594 --> 16:12.764
Barber College.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.934
Graduated class of '37.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.352
They didn't even have

16:15.975 --> 16:18.352
blow-dryers in '37.

16:18.394 --> 16:22.857
Jess...they didn't

16:18.394 --> 16:22.857
need 'em back then.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.275
All you did was

16:22.899 --> 16:24.275
hang your head out

16:24.317 --> 16:27.153
the old Desoto

16:24.317 --> 16:27.153
and lean on the gas.

16:27.194 --> 16:28.195
Of course, you had

16:27.194 --> 16:28.195
to watch out for the

16:28.237 --> 16:30.406
other guy

16:28.237 --> 16:30.406
drying his hair.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.991
Boom!

16:32.032 --> 16:34.160
That's where the term

16:32.032 --> 16:34.160
"Head-on collision" came from.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.662
[chuckling]

16:35.703 --> 16:37.997
That's it, boys.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.997
Get in the car. Let's go.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.707
Jess, please.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.707
It's just a haircut.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.835
- Can we get on with this?

16:39.749 --> 16:41.835
- Alright, fine.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.002
But it's going to be

16:41.876 --> 16:43.002
your fault if they

16:43.043 --> 16:44.712
end up looking

16:43.043 --> 16:44.712
like melon-heads.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.341
Come on, sweetie.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.341
You wanna get in a rocket ship?

16:48.382 --> 16:51.636
Look at this.

16:48.382 --> 16:51.636
Mummy'll put you in here.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.305
Alright, strap 'em in tight.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.305
It's gonna be a long ride.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.098
Wow, can you try this?

16:56.140 --> 16:57.934
Alright, they're ready.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.477
Uh-oh.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.228
Uh-oh.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.106
Uh-oh.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.780
Will you just

17:08.528 --> 17:10.780
cut their hair?

17:10.822 --> 17:12.448
Alright, alright,

17:10.822 --> 17:12.448
alright, already.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.826
Ahem.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.826
Hey. Ahem.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.747
Jasper, wait!

17:19.789 --> 17:21.374
Jess, maybe you were right.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.668
Maybe the boys aren't

17:21.415 --> 17:23.668
ready for this.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.671
Boy, you two were really

17:23.710 --> 17:26.671
made for each other.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.381
Will you excuse us

17:26.713 --> 17:28.381
one second, Jasper?

17:28.422 --> 17:31.175
- Thanks.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.175
- Sure.

17:31.217 --> 17:35.054
I've really got to start

17:31.217 --> 17:35.054
charging by the hour.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.347
Becky, what's

17:35.095 --> 17:36.347
the matter with you?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.932
I'm the one who's

17:36.389 --> 17:37.932
the maniac here.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.308
Well, you are.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.435
I-It's just that,

17:39.350 --> 17:41.435
it just hit me.

17:41.477 --> 17:43.187
It all starts

17:41.477 --> 17:43.187
with the haircut.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.397
Pretty soon they're

17:43.229 --> 17:44.397
potty-trained.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.815
Then they're going off

17:44.438 --> 17:45.815
to kindergarten.

17:45.857 --> 17:47.775
Then they're shaving,

17:45.857 --> 17:47.775
then before you know it

17:47.817 --> 17:49.360
they're married and they have

17:47.817 --> 17:49.360
kids of their own.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.278
They'll never write,

17:49.402 --> 17:51.278
they'll never call.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.031
Jess, we're losing them.

17:55.366 --> 17:57.368
Becky, you're losing it.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.871
Now, come on, n-now one

17:57.410 --> 17:59.871
of us has to be rational.

17:59.913 --> 18:00.955
We're dealing with

17:59.913 --> 18:00.955
cutting their hair.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.415
So it's gotta be you.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.918
Jess, it's just that

18:02.456 --> 18:04.918
they're growing up so fast.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.420
I know, sweetheart,

18:04.959 --> 18:07.420
but we can't go crazy every time

18:07.461 --> 18:08.588
they go through

18:07.461 --> 18:08.588
a new stage.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.630
We're just gonna

18:08.629 --> 18:09.630
have to learn to

18:09.672 --> 18:11.007
live with it

18:09.672 --> 18:11.007
and go along.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.592
- That's all.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.592
- Yeah, you're right.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.219
I mean I guess we don't

18:12.633 --> 18:15.219
have any choice, do we?

18:17.263 --> 18:18.932
[sighs]

18:20.641 --> 18:23.352
Alright, Jasper.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.352
We're ready.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.813
Oh, good,

18:23.394 --> 18:25.813
'cause I'm finished.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.232
There you are.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.609
And there you are.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.947
A little

18:31.444 --> 18:33.947
finishing touch, huh?

18:35.073 --> 18:37.241
Oh, Nicky, Alex

18:37.283 --> 18:39.201
you look so handsome.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.203
Oh, boys..

18:41.245 --> 18:43.372
Very, very nice.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.249
Good lift, good flow.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.960
Hey, Beck, look at this,

18:45.291 --> 18:46.960
they got blue eyes.

18:49.545 --> 18:53.674
Hey, and here's a reward

18:49.545 --> 18:53.674
for being so doggone brave.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.510
Oh, look, boys,

18:53.716 --> 18:56.510
you get balloons.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.345
No, these are

18:56.552 --> 18:58.345
for you two.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.983
I told you. Her ears

19:06.646 --> 19:09.983
look like Franken berries.

19:12.610 --> 19:15.195
Stephanie, your ears

19:12.610 --> 19:15.195
are infected.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.614
Ow.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.492
Michelle, you promised

19:16.656 --> 19:19.492
you wouldn't tell.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.535
I promised

19:19.533 --> 19:21.535
I wouldn't tell dad.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.245
Does this look like dad?

19:24.872 --> 19:26.582
Stephanie, did you

19:24.872 --> 19:26.582
pierce them at the mall

19:26.624 --> 19:28.084
after dad told you "No?"

19:28.126 --> 19:31.170
Of course, not.

19:28.126 --> 19:31.170
Ouch. I'm not that stupid.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.213
She let Kimmy do it.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.883
What?

19:35.925 --> 19:38.302
You let Kimmy punch

19:35.925 --> 19:38.302
a hole in your body?

19:38.344 --> 19:41.889
Why didn't you just

19:38.344 --> 19:41.889
fall on a rusty nail?

19:41.931 --> 19:43.307
Stephanie, you have

19:41.931 --> 19:43.307
to tell dad.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.309
He needs to take

19:43.349 --> 19:45.309
you to a doctor.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.560
Oh, no.

19:46.602 --> 19:47.937
That's okay.

19:47.979 --> 19:51.482
If you don't yell,

19:47.979 --> 19:51.482
you get a lollipop.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.609
And if you yell a lot,

19:51.524 --> 19:53.609
you get two.

20:02.035 --> 20:05.955
[chuckles]

20:02.035 --> 20:05.955
Hey, girls, look at this.

20:02.035 --> 20:05.955
A rubber pencil.

20:05.997 --> 20:08.916
Sorry, dad. I see you're in the

20:05.997 --> 20:08.916
middle of something important.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.585
Okay, okay.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.589
Uh, dad, before

20:13.087 --> 20:15.589
you get angry--

20:15.631 --> 20:18.092
Oh, I hate conversations

20:15.631 --> 20:18.092
that start like that.

20:20.136 --> 20:24.098
Dad, I let Kimmy Gibbler

20:20.136 --> 20:24.098
pierce my ears.

20:25.432 --> 20:27.143
[chuckles]

20:30.771 --> 20:32.398
Yeah, right.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.484
Come on, what did

20:34.150 --> 20:35.484
you really do?

20:39.488 --> 20:43.659
My god. Steph,

20:39.488 --> 20:43.659
t-they're infected.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.619
Do you have any idea

20:43.701 --> 20:45.619
how dangerous this is?

20:45.661 --> 20:47.580
Now, dad, remember,

20:45.661 --> 20:47.580
she's only 10.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.457
I mean I did a lot of

20:47.621 --> 20:50.457
stupid things in my time.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.002
Things you wouldn't

20:50.499 --> 20:53.002
even believe.

20:53.044 --> 20:54.754
Like what?

20:54.795 --> 20:57.840
Uh...maybe you two

20:54.795 --> 20:57.840
should work this out.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.637
Steph, sit down.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.640
You lied to me and you

21:03.679 --> 21:06.640
deliberately disobeyed me.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.017
I told you you could get

21:06.682 --> 21:08.017
your ears pierced

21:08.059 --> 21:09.560
when you got to

21:08.059 --> 21:09.560
Junior high, like D.J.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.605
Why do I have to do

21:09.602 --> 21:12.605
everything like D.J.?

21:12.646 --> 21:16.025
When D.J. did it,

21:12.646 --> 21:16.025
how D.J. did it.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.694
I want to be treated

21:16.067 --> 21:18.694
like an individual.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.280
Okay, okay.

21:21.321 --> 21:23.074
T-That's a good point.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.533
It is?

21:24.575 --> 21:25.910
I mean, it is.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.789
Steph, let me ask

21:27.870 --> 21:29.789
you a question.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.540
Why did you want

21:29.830 --> 21:31.540
pierced ears?

21:31.582 --> 21:33.667
All my friends

21:31.582 --> 21:33.667
have them.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.377
So you wanted to be an

21:33.709 --> 21:35.377
individual so you could be

21:35.419 --> 21:37.964
exactly like your friends?

21:38.005 --> 21:40.507
Well...no.

21:40.549 --> 21:43.385
I guess...maybe.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.222
Honey, if your friends didn't

21:43.427 --> 21:46.222
have pierced ears

21:46.264 --> 21:47.389
would you still want them?

21:49.267 --> 21:50.643
I don't know.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.187
Is this a trick question?

21:53.229 --> 21:56.107
Stephanie, if you want

21:53.229 --> 21:56.107
to be an individual

21:56.149 --> 21:58.400
you have to know

21:56.149 --> 21:58.400
what you want.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.693
'As you get older,

21:58.442 --> 21:59.693
you're gonna have to make'

21:59.735 --> 22:01.612
more and more

21:59.735 --> 22:01.612
tough decisions.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.530
And you can't,

22:01.654 --> 22:03.530
you can't base your decisions

22:03.572 --> 22:05.449
on what your friends

22:03.572 --> 22:05.449
are doing or what's popular

22:05.491 --> 22:07.118
or what's on TV.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.329
You have to know

22:07.160 --> 22:10.329
what works for you.

22:10.370 --> 22:12.123
How will I know?

22:12.165 --> 22:14.708
Well, you have to think

22:12.165 --> 22:14.708
about what's right.

22:14.750 --> 22:17.211
And then if you

22:14.750 --> 22:17.211
ever have any doubts

22:17.253 --> 22:19.546
it's what I'm here for.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.091
I love you, Steph.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.550
I love you, too, dad.

22:23.592 --> 22:24.677
Come here.

22:27.554 --> 22:29.307
I'm so sorry.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.809
Listen, from now on..

22:31.851 --> 22:34.103
...we're gonna look at

22:31.851 --> 22:34.103
each situation individually

22:34.145 --> 22:37.439
and we're gonna base the rules

22:34.145 --> 22:37.439
on what works for you, okay?

22:37.481 --> 22:38.941
That sounds great.

22:38.983 --> 22:41.152
Okay, let's get you to the

22:38.983 --> 22:41.152
doctor and check those ears.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.236
Good idea.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.445
And then on the way back

22:43.487 --> 22:45.656
we'll stop for burgers

22:43.487 --> 22:45.656
and fries.

22:45.698 --> 22:46.907
You're on a roll.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.034
Because that's

22:46.949 --> 22:48.034
the last meal

22:48.075 --> 22:49.076
you're gonna be having out

22:49.118 --> 22:50.536
for a<i> long time.</i>

22:52.288 --> 22:54.957
- Grounded, huh?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.957
- Yep.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.043
I should have seen

22:54.999 --> 22:57.043
that one coming.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.961
I can't believe

22:57.084 --> 22:58.961
you let Kimmy Gibbler

22:59.003 --> 23:00.338
punch a hole

22:59.003 --> 23:00.338
through your head.
