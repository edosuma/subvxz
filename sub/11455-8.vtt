00:22.773 --> 00:25.232
Michael amended his will two months ago.

00:25.276 --> 00:28.110
I'm sure you understand
this sets off alarm bells.

00:28.154 --> 00:31.780
$500,000 was left in the
name of Chelsea Rayne.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.699
Are you Chelsea Rayne?

00:35.119 --> 00:36.618
Can I ask you something?

00:36.662 --> 00:39.288
- Will you tell me the truth?
- Sure.

00:39.331 --> 00:40.456
What's your real name?

00:41.125 --> 00:42.291
It's Annabel.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.917
I'm really happy we
finally get to meet you.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.753
Jack's been talking about you for weeks.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.131
- Hello?
- I miss you already.

00:49.175 --> 00:50.799
How did you get this number?

00:50.843 --> 00:52.259
What's the problem?

00:52.303 --> 00:53.802
Uh, someone sent you this.

00:53.846 --> 00:56.138
I do not want you in my life, Jack.

00:56.182 --> 00:58.223
Never call me again!

00:59.727 --> 01:00.934
Learn this guy's face.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.227
He's the devil.

01:02.271 --> 01:04.104
My client is suing the
shit out of his client.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.313
It's not going to trial.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.648
I got it.

01:06.692 --> 01:10.486
I will make sure it is
not going to trial.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.947
Tell me what my choices are.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.449
I wanna hear you say it.

01:16.077 --> 01:17.367
I'm gonna go.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.952
I'm leaving your money on the table.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.829
Christine?

01:20.873 --> 01:22.956
Who the fuck are you?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.792
Tomorrow you're gonna
call Peter Gramercy.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.168
And you're gonna tell him
that you're disclaiming

01:26.212 --> 01:28.212
any and all interests in
Michaels Cilic's estate.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.297
If you don't make this call,

01:30.341 --> 01:32.883
everyone will find out what
you really do for a living.

01:41.852 --> 01:45.687
My clients would literally
kill for your hair.

01:45.731 --> 01:48.816
I hope they wouldn't
literally kill anyone.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.779
- Sorry, I just...
- Okay.

01:53.823 --> 01:55.364
Yes?

01:55.407 --> 01:58.283
Peter Gramercy's office just
sent over a disclaimer request.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.535
I could probably get you the money...

01:59.578 --> 02:01.120
Okay, so do that.

02:01.163 --> 02:04.957
But they say they have enough
to prove prostitution.

02:07.086 --> 02:09.919
- Excuse me, I just...
- Oh.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.672
I insisted on a gag clause.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.675
The money will be held
in escrow for a year.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.260
If they breach it, try to out you,

02:16.303 --> 02:17.678
it'll render this
agreement null and void

02:17.721 --> 02:19.847
and they'll have to pay you the money.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.683
Fine. But what is their case against me?

02:22.726 --> 02:24.351
"Hi, we hired some asshole

02:24.395 --> 02:26.228
to solicit sex from a
top-notch law student

02:26.272 --> 02:28.772
with no record, who turned him down.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.524
Can you arrest her?"

02:30.568 --> 02:32.860
I mean, yes, they can. It doesn't
matter what the truth is.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.695
They have money. They're angry.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.865
- They will smear you, dear.
- Please don't call me "dear".

02:37.908 --> 02:39.408
I'd sign it.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.868
Fuck you, Martin!

02:40.911 --> 02:42.870
Hey, don't get mad at the messenger.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.204
He left the money for me!

02:44.248 --> 02:46.373
You know what we gotta do?
Find you a boyfriend.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.000
You're not funny.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.885
I'm just juggling a lot right now.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.469
So is every other student.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.472
But I'm particularly concerned
about your recent attendance,

03:02.516 --> 03:04.183
or lack thereof.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.434
I'm allowed three absences.

03:05.477 --> 03:07.269
I don't understand why
there's cause for alarm.

03:07.313 --> 03:09.021
You're up to three already.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.690
It's not like you, that's all. I'm
just making sure you're okay.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.358
I'm fine.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.194
Well, I'm glad to hear you're fine,

03:15.237 --> 03:17.946
but if you miss one more class,
you'll have to take the course over.

03:17.990 --> 03:21.033
I got it under control,
I know what I'm doing.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.075
Okay.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.411
Well, as long as you're aware.

03:24.455 --> 03:25.996
Now, soon after,

03:26.040 --> 03:27.414
frustrated with the process,

03:27.458 --> 03:30.209
he drafts a new summary, which then...

03:30.252 --> 03:33.045
Well, what does he do next, Christine?

03:33.964 --> 03:36.089
He needs someone to sign.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.257
Someone?

03:38.010 --> 03:40.052
Uh, a-a qualified...

03:40.095 --> 03:42.012
Well, there's a name for it...

03:42.056 --> 03:43.013
Justin.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.014
POSITA.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.515
And what does that mean, Christine?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.434
Person of Ordinary Skill in the Art.

03:47.478 --> 03:50.270
Correct. So, our client uses a POSITA,

03:50.314 --> 03:53.190
who, in this case, happens
to also be his buddy...

03:58.989 --> 04:00.030
Christine!

04:03.577 --> 04:05.410
Just wanna talk.

04:08.499 --> 04:10.582
Look-look, I miss... I miss you.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.087
This is weird for me, too.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.589
But you've given me
no other option here.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.882
This is not an option.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.135
Yeah, well, you-you're not
returning my phone calls,

04:22.179 --> 04:23.512
my-my emails,

04:24.265 --> 04:25.347
my-my text messages...

04:25.391 --> 04:27.307
I- I feel like you've...

04:27.351 --> 04:29.142
you've painted me into a corner here,

04:29.186 --> 04:32.646
you pushed me into a corner, and
that's-that's why I came here.

04:33.983 --> 04:36.191
I'm sorry, I don't know you.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.361
Christine, look...

04:39.405 --> 04:41.071
Don't go, don't...!

04:41.115 --> 04:44.116
Look, I just... I want to talk, okay?

04:45.119 --> 04:46.368
Turn the car off, I want to talk.

04:46.412 --> 04:47.369
I just want to talk!

04:47.413 --> 04:49.496
I want to talk!

04:53.127 --> 04:55.294
You fucking piece of shit!

04:55.337 --> 04:57.170
You fucking dick!

04:57.214 --> 04:58.672
Back me into a fucking corner!

04:58.716 --> 05:01.508
You wanna play victim, you fucking dick?

05:01.552 --> 05:03.635
I will fuck you up!

05:11.478 --> 05:13.145
Hi, you've reached Ana.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.188
Can't get to the phone,
so leave me a message.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.773
Thanks.

05:17.568 --> 05:18.567
Hey, Ana, it's Annabel!

05:18.610 --> 05:20.152
Finally calling about lunch.

05:20.195 --> 05:23.280
Um, I just wanted to know if
you're available tomorrow?

05:23.324 --> 05:26.366
Call me back on my cell phone, um...

05:26.410 --> 05:27.951
or text me, either way.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.494
Alright, thanks.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.664
I feel weird talking to you about Jack

05:32.708 --> 05:36.501
because, obviously, you and I
don't know each other very well.

05:36.545 --> 05:40.213
But I would not do this...

05:40.257 --> 05:42.549
if I didn't have to.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.259
I'm sure this is uncomfortable for you,

05:44.303 --> 05:48.472
because, obviously, you're very
close to Jack and I'm his...

05:48.515 --> 05:50.432
ex-girlfriend...

05:50.476 --> 05:51.850
Essentially.

05:53.062 --> 05:54.436
Sure, okay.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.521
But I...

05:57.483 --> 05:59.232
I just... I...

05:59.276 --> 06:03.320
I just want you to check on
him and see if he's okay.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.948
I would call him, but I-I honestly

06:06.992 --> 06:10.452
don't feel comfortable calling him.

06:10.496 --> 06:13.622
To be completely honest, I
feel scared to call him.

06:15.459 --> 06:19.544
I... I don't think he
would do anything to you.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.547
I wish I could agree with you.

06:22.591 --> 06:25.384
I still don't understand what
he did that was so alarming.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.429
You need to do what you
need to do, but...

06:29.473 --> 06:31.264
I don't want to put you
in the middle of this.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.891
I feel terrible.

06:33.394 --> 06:34.434
I just...

06:34.478 --> 06:37.145
I just would like you to talk to him

06:37.189 --> 06:38.980
because his behavior needs to stop.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.774
He's threatening me.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.735
And disrupting my life.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.113
And I don't want to have
to get legal about it.

06:50.536 --> 06:53.703
Because that would break my heart.

07:14.143 --> 07:15.475
Hi there.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.561
Umm... That'll be $55.26.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.605
- Was this in yesterday?
- Yeah, yesterday.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.638
How much it is? $55...?

07:53.682 --> 07:55.765
Uh, $55.20...

07:55.809 --> 07:57.350
Here's $60, keep the change.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.768
Oh, thank you.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.483
Hey!

09:29.236 --> 09:31.528
Who's your friend back there?

09:36.827 --> 09:37.909
Lick him.

09:39.663 --> 09:40.662
You're sick.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.543
You have excellent cheekbones.

09:46.587 --> 09:47.794
Thanks.

09:57.556 --> 09:58.597
Hi.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.932
What's your name?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.478
Okay.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.232
What are you doing?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.867
Don't talk.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.363
Shit!

12:12.607 --> 12:14.107
Christine?

12:14.151 --> 12:16.943
- I was just leaving.
- Yeah, I can see that.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.194
You look nice.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.779
Yeah, I was just meeting
some of my friends here,

12:19.823 --> 12:21.072
having a drink.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.782
Right.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.619
What are you actually doing here?

12:26.663 --> 12:28.204
I could ask you the same question.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.706
What?

12:29.750 --> 12:30.957
Are you following me?

12:31.001 --> 12:32.625
I was having lunch with my friends.

12:32.669 --> 12:33.668
Stop.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.128
I don't have time for this shit.

12:35.172 --> 12:37.046
I saw who you were sitting with.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.968
You need to think twice

12:42.012 --> 12:44.971
before entertaining childish
conspiracy theories.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.265
- Is that a threat?
- I'm just saying...

12:47.309 --> 12:49.309
it would be in your best interest

12:49.352 --> 12:51.102
not to mention

12:51.146 --> 12:54.230
a coincidental meeting
between two friends.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.149
Clear?

13:00.906 --> 13:03.323
Hope you had a nice brunch.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.754
I'm at the third table from
the entrance on the right,

13:17.798 --> 13:19.547
I'm wearing a pin stripe
suit and admittedly,

13:19.591 --> 13:20.673
- I'm in the loss of hair department...
- I'm so sorry, Simon,

13:20.717 --> 13:22.509
but I'm gonna have to cancel our date.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.511
- This is very unprofessional.
- I know, I'm so sorry.

13:24.554 --> 13:27.138
Something actually came up last minute.

13:30.644 --> 13:33.561
It's not going to trial. I got it.

13:33.605 --> 13:37.315
I will make sure it is
not going to trial.

13:39.194 --> 13:41.277
Our deal still stands.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.280
Checks go to QUORTA.

13:46.368 --> 13:49.577
It's not going to trial. I got it.

13:49.621 --> 13:53.456
I will make sure it is
not going to trial.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.001
Our deal still stands.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.004
Checks go to QUORTA.

14:00.048 --> 14:03.049
It's not going to trial. I got it.

14:03.093 --> 14:07.262
I will make sure it is
not going to trial.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.947
- Hey.
- Oh hey.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.324
Umm...

14:28.368 --> 14:30.743
So I just- I got a call from I.T.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.745
They noticed that my
password was being used

14:32.789 --> 14:35.290
on multiple computers
at the same time, so...

14:35.333 --> 14:36.499
Okay.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.336
Well, I need more time.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.338
I'm just trying to find the
files that you can't find.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.299
- Yeah, I...
- Kayla, I'm trying to help you.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.718
Well don't, okay? 'Cause I
don't want to lose my job.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.928
So... Don't use my password.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.263
Fine.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.598
Okay.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.905
Skip wants to see you. He's not happy.

15:10.452 --> 15:13.036
- You wanted to see me?
- Ahhh...

15:13.079 --> 15:17.498
Why did you change my language
in the Eisner application?

15:17.542 --> 15:19.292
You told me to err on
the side of caution.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.794
Our client's Claim 15
seemed dangerously close

15:21.838 --> 15:23.922
to CME's already existing patent.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.673
"Seemed"?

15:25.717 --> 15:29.719
I asked you to run a simple clearance
search, verifying facts...

15:29.763 --> 15:32.931
Not opinions. Our client isn't
paying us for your opinion.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.141
It was a suggestion. I
noted that in the margins.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.602
Next time, keep them to yourself.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.382
Christine Reade...

16:07.425 --> 16:09.509
- Do you have time?
- Okay.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.762
You can go in.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.025
Look, I know we're not friends.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.527
Of course, we're friends.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.362
Great, we're friends.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.447
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.573
About David?

16:33.243 --> 16:34.909
Is this personal?

16:34.953 --> 16:35.910
Yes...

16:35.954 --> 16:37.245
No, no.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.125
Um, I have-I haven't talked
to anyone about this

16:42.168 --> 16:45.920
because it could open Kirkland
up to a malpractice suit.

16:45.964 --> 16:49.090
Um, you're heading XHP now,
so I thought I'd tell you.

16:52.345 --> 16:56.222
David's intentionally
throwing the XHP case.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.267
That's a very serious accusation.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.227
It's not an accusation.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.066
What's this?

17:07.109 --> 17:08.151
Play it.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.330
It's not going to trial. I got it.

17:22.375 --> 17:26.085
I will make sure it is
not going to trial.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.381
Our deal still stands.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.383
Checks go to QUORTA.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.470
I have more.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.596
Like what?

17:37.974 --> 17:40.683
You should talk to the opposing counsel.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.519
To Ben Holgrem.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.558
Come in.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.450
Have a seat.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.884
She knows about QUORTA.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.815
- Hi, Mom.
- Christine, hi!

19:10.859 --> 19:12.525
Is this a good time?

19:12.569 --> 19:15.278
Uh, not really. What is it?

19:15.321 --> 19:17.697
A man just called the
house, asking for you.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.073
He wouldn't leave his name or number.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.533
He said it was urgent.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.034
Did he say what it's about?

19:22.078 --> 19:24.745
No, but he asked if I was your mother.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.289
Well, what did you say?

19:26.332 --> 19:28.374
Well... I didn't tell him anything.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.459
I don't know who this person is.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.045
- And he didn't he say who he was? - No.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.173
Did you ask?

19:35.216 --> 19:38.009
Of course. I'm not stupid, Christine!

19:44.601 --> 19:45.892
I'm sure it was fine.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.268
I don't think there's
anything to worry about it.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.854
It's probably just like a
sales call or something.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.189
Okay.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.024
Thought you'd want to know.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.781
I don't think there's
anything to worry about it.

20:00.825 --> 20:02.283
I'm gonna call you back.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.492
Okay.

21:09.852 --> 21:12.603
What are we going to do about her?

21:13.856 --> 21:15.648
I don't think she has much.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.818
If she did, she would've gone
straight to the police already.

21:18.861 --> 21:20.987
Not if she wants leverage.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.822
Leverage for what?

21:22.865 --> 21:24.448
I don't think she's that smart.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.326
Look, I don't have a dick.

21:27.370 --> 21:29.328
And Ben's not dumb enough to dip his

21:29.372 --> 21:31.872
into some crazy, bitch intern.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.332
I'm not going to prison.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.334
He's not going to prison.

21:35.378 --> 21:38.462
By all means, if you'd like to, David...

21:41.718 --> 21:43.968
Maybe it'll all just blow over.

21:44.554 --> 21:45.803
Shut up, Ben.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.727
Christine...

21:52.770 --> 21:55.438
Come by my office,
we'll finish our talk.

21:55.481 --> 21:56.564
Okay.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.783
I really don't think we
should shy away from Heron.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.536
They're offering 30% equity.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.039
The profit margins could be huge.

22:13.082 --> 22:16.375
And what if they're not profitable?

22:16.419 --> 22:19.128
How soon can we terminate
their contract?

22:19.172 --> 22:22.673
Six months after the
application's approved.

22:23.926 --> 22:25.885
Six months?

22:28.890 --> 22:30.848
Think about it.

22:39.984 --> 22:42.485
Skip Hadderly's office
this is Christine Reade.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.863
What did you tell Ana, you fucking cunt?

22:54.832 --> 22:56.540
Susan, will you set
up lunch this week...

22:56.584 --> 22:58.125
- with uh, in-house at Heron?
- Mm-hmm.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.919
- Include Tariq Barr.
- Okay.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.922
- Anything else?
- No, that's it, thank you.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.741
Take it in all the way.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.425
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

23:47.468 --> 23:49.760
It turns you on, getting paid.

23:52.056 --> 23:55.057
- Say it.
- It turns me on!

24:14.579 --> 24:17.121
Take it in all the way.

24:19.834 --> 24:22.168
You like getting paid
for sex, don't you?

24:22.211 --> 24:24.628
It turns you on, getting paid.

24:27.008 --> 24:28.090
Say it.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.216
It turns me on!
