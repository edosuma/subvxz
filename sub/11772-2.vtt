WEBVTT

00:06.367 --> 00:08.333
( theme music playing )

00:13.867 --> 00:15.967
SO THEN HE GOES
LIKE THIS...

00:16.000 --> 00:18.800
I GO, "WHAT IS IT, DAD?"
HE GOES...

00:18.833 --> 00:20.533
( raspy ) LIKE THIS.
HE CAN'T TALK.

00:20.567 --> 00:22.833
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL,
THE BED, YOU KNOW?

00:22.867 --> 00:24.267
( rasps )

00:24.300 --> 00:27.700
SO I LEAN IN,
AND HE WHISPERS IN MY EAR.

00:27.733 --> 00:29.533
HE SAYS TO ME,

00:29.567 --> 00:32.167
( slowly )
"YOU'RE ADOPTED."

00:33.700 --> 00:36.000
- HE SAID THAT?
- I THINK HE SAID THAT.

00:36.033 --> 00:38.967
MAYBE HE SAID,
"YOU'RE A DOCTOR."
I DON'T KNOW.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.533
BUT WHY WOULD HE SAY
I'M A DOCTOR? I WOULD KNOW
IF I'M A DOCTOR.

00:41.567 --> 00:43.733
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE WOULD WAIT UNTIL
NOW TO TELL YOU?

00:43.767 --> 00:45.300
MAYBE HE THOUGHT
HE WAS DYING.

00:45.333 --> 00:47.367
BUT I'M STILL NOT 100% SURE
THAT HE SAID IT.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.633
SO BASICALLY
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

00:49.667 --> 00:51.933
YOU WANT ME TO FIND OUT
IF YOU'RE ADOPTED OR NOT.

00:51.967 --> 00:53.600
YES.

00:53.633 --> 00:55.867
FIRST, HOW DID YOU
FIND ME?

00:55.900 --> 00:58.167
MY FRIEND SAID
HE READ THIS BIG ARTICLE

00:58.200 --> 01:00.400
ABOUT YOU
IN THE L.A. MAGAZINE.

01:00.433 --> 01:03.733
"BEST BEST PRIVATE
INVESTIGATOR IN LOS ANGELES."

01:03.767 --> 01:05.100
LOOK, MR. DAVID,

01:05.133 --> 01:07.767
I HAVE TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.567
MY BUSINESS
AND WHAT I DO--

01:09.600 --> 01:11.233
WHAT I DO IS
I SERVICE THE COMMUNITY.

01:11.267 --> 01:12.900
BASICALLYWHAT I'M SAYING IS,

01:12.933 --> 01:15.433
I DON'T SEE A WAY
THAT YOU WOULD, UH,

01:15.467 --> 01:17.200
BE HELPING MY COMMUNITY.

01:17.233 --> 01:19.433
WHAT ABOUT...

01:19.467 --> 01:21.400
CALLING SOME BINGO GAMES
OR SOMETHING?

01:21.433 --> 01:24.233
YOU GOT, LIKE,
A COMMUNITY CENTER
FOR BINGO?

01:24.267 --> 01:26.100
BINGO'S A DISTRACTION.

01:26.133 --> 01:28.233
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE BINGO.

01:29.900 --> 01:32.267
I'VE GOT EXTRA SNEAKERS
THAT I DON'T WEAR ANYMORE

01:32.300 --> 01:34.867
- IN PRETTY GOOD
CONDITION, I MUST SAY.
- EXTRA SNEAKERS?

01:34.900 --> 01:36.767
I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO DONATE 'EM.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.700
MR. DAVID, I DON'T THINK
THIS IS GONNA WORK.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.600
IT WOULD MEAN
AN AWFUL LOT TO ME.

01:41.633 --> 01:43.833
PLEASE PLEASE,
THINK ABOUT IT.

01:43.867 --> 01:46.133
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO CONVINCE YOU,

01:46.167 --> 01:48.600
- I WOULD.
- I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING.

01:48.633 --> 01:50.800
WHAT ABOUT A BIG BROTHER
KIND OF THING?

01:52.567 --> 01:54.400
LET ME TALK TO SOME
OF MY COMMUNITY LEADERS

01:54.433 --> 01:56.300
- AND SEE EXACTLY
WHAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS--
- YEAH, OKAY,

01:56.333 --> 01:58.167
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
FOR A LONG TIME.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.767
MAYBE FOR ONE AFTERNOON,

02:00.800 --> 02:02.600
TO A MOVIE OR SOMETHING.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.900
UM, IS THAT A KEY
TO THE MEN'S ROOM?

02:06.933 --> 02:09.133
WELL, IT SAYS "MEN"ON IT. YES.

02:09.167 --> 02:11.067
IT'S A NATURAL QUESTION
TO ASK.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.833
- YES.
- MAY I BORROW THE KEY?

02:13.867 --> 02:16.233
- YES, YOU MAY
BORROW THE KEY.
- THANK YOU.

02:16.267 --> 02:18.167
OKAY.
THANKS, MR. JONES.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.200
- AND YOU'LL THINK
ABOUT IT?
- I WILL.

02:20.233 --> 02:21.200
BY THE WAY...

02:21.233 --> 02:23.700
LOVE THE BOW-TIE.

02:23.733 --> 02:26.500
( whistling "Yankee Doodle,"
tapping )

02:27.600 --> 02:29.533
( toilet flushing )

02:32.767 --> 02:35.667
( stops whistling )

02:35.700 --> 02:38.767
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
- USING THE BATHROOM.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.400
THAT'S MY STALL!
DID YOU SEE THE PLAQUE
ON IT--

02:41.433 --> 02:43.900
YES, I KNOW,
BUT SOMEBODY WAS USING
THE OTHER ONE, SO I--

02:43.933 --> 02:45.567
WELL, THEN YOU WAIT!

02:45.600 --> 02:48.533
I COULDN'T WAIT.
IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.
I HAD TO GO!

02:48.567 --> 02:50.933
THERE'S ONE STALL FOR ME,
AND YOU'RE IN IT!

02:50.967 --> 02:53.067
IF YOU WERE HERE,
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU
FIRST DIBS.

02:53.100 --> 02:55.767
BUT HONESTLY, I HAVEN'T SEEN
A HANDICAPPED PERSON
IN THE BATHROOM,

02:55.800 --> 02:58.900
MAYBE EVER.
SO I THOUGHT I COULD
PERHAPS TAKE MY CHANCES.

02:58.933 --> 03:01.067
"A HANDICAPPED PERSON"?

03:01.100 --> 03:03.500
THAT'S NICE.
OH, THAT'S NICE!

03:03.533 --> 03:05.333
- IT'S CALLED DISABLED.
DISABLED.
- DISABLED?

03:05.367 --> 03:07.700
WELL, THAT DOESN'T
SOUND SO HOT.

03:07.733 --> 03:10.567
I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT IT
SOUNDS LIKE TO YOU, OKAY?
IT'S DISABLED.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.700
I THINK I WOULD PREFER
HANDICAPPED.

03:12.733 --> 03:15.767
GOD, YOU KNOW
HOW ARCHAIC THAT WORD IS?
"A HANDICAPPED PERSON"!

03:15.800 --> 03:17.200
THAT'S DEMEANING,
DON'T YOU KNOW?

03:17.233 --> 03:18.833
- I'M A DISABLED PERSON.
- OH, SORRY.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.667
- ( mocking )
YOU'RE SORRY.
- OH, SORRY.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.733
NOW YOU'VE
LEARNED A LESSON.
PLEASE, DON'T EVER GO

03:22.767 --> 03:24.833
- IN MY STALL AGAIN!
ALL RIGHT?
- FINE, OKAY.

03:24.867 --> 03:25.967
- THANKS SO MUCH!
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

03:26.067 --> 03:27.500
- I APPRECIATE IT.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

03:27.533 --> 03:29.333
DOUCHE-BAG.

03:34.833 --> 03:36.200
SO YOU THINK
HE'S A MUSLIM?

03:36.233 --> 03:38.733
- HE HAD THE BOW-TIE.
- HUH?

03:38.767 --> 03:41.300
DO BLACK MEN
WHO AREN'T MUSLIMS
EVER WEAR BOW-TIES?

03:41.333 --> 03:44.500
- I HAVEN'T SEEN IT.
- IT'D BE INTERESTING
TO FIND THAT OUT.

03:44.533 --> 03:46.867
- I'M SURPRISED
YOU DIDN'T ASK HIM.
- YEAH, ME TOO.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.100
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T CARE EITHER WAY,
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

03:49.133 --> 03:52.067
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING,
THAT I THINK HE'S A MUSLIM.

03:52.067 --> 03:54.067
( quietly )
HEY, THAT'S
A HANDICAPPED SPOT.

03:57.767 --> 03:59.667
WH-WH-WHAT?

03:59.700 --> 04:02.067
WHAT'S WITH THE WALKING?

04:02.067 --> 04:03.767
( stuttering )
FUCK YOU!

04:03.800 --> 04:06.700
I HAVE A STUTTER!

04:06.733 --> 04:08.367
YEAH, BUT YOU CAN WALK.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.200
( stuttering )
LOOK AT MY LICENSE PLATE!

04:11.233 --> 04:13.200
I HAVE PERMISSION,

04:13.233 --> 04:15.533
YOU FUCKING PRICK!

04:26.300 --> 04:28.433
OH HEY...

04:28.467 --> 04:30.067
WE GOT A DOG.

04:30.067 --> 04:32.333
REALLY? WHY?

04:32.367 --> 04:34.933
- SHE WANTED A DOG.
- YOU HAVE TO WALK IT
AND EVERYTHING?

04:34.967 --> 04:37.433
- I'M SURE I'LL WIND UP
DOING STUFF.
- OH, DEFINITELY.

04:37.467 --> 04:39.500
I KNOW, YEAH,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S KIND OF CUTE.

04:39.533 --> 04:40.833
- LARRY!
- I KIND OF LIKE IT. HI!

04:40.867 --> 04:43.200
- HI!
- JODI!

04:43.233 --> 04:45.067
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GREAT, GREAT.

04:45.067 --> 04:47.567
- SO GOOD TO SEE YOU!
- GREAT TO SEE YOU.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.167
- HI JODI.
- HI.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.200
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- HOW ARE YOU DOING,
MS. JODI FUNKHOUSER?

04:51.233 --> 04:52.567
( laughs )

04:52.600 --> 04:54.267
- SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
- NOTHING.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.133
- SEEKING ATTENTION,
GETTING REJECTED.
- ( laughs )

04:56.167 --> 04:58.733
- ARE THOSE NEW GLASSES?
- NO, BUT I CLEANED THEM.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.667
YOU'RE SO FUNNY!

05:00.700 --> 05:02.333
- I'M HERE WITH MY DAD.
- OH YEAH?

05:02.367 --> 05:06.067
ARE YOU COMING
TO MY PARENTS'
25th ANNIVERSARY PARTY?

05:06.067 --> 05:07.667
I AM.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.900
- OH. ARE YOU?
- EH...

05:09.933 --> 05:11.900
IT'LL BE FUN, REALLY.
THINK ABOUT IT.

05:11.933 --> 05:13.867
I'M NOT GONNA
THINK ABOUT IT,
BUT WHATEVER.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.633
- I REALLY HOPE YOU COME.
- WELL, THANKS.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.067
- IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.500
- WOW, GREAT TO SEE YOU.
- YEAH. BYE-BYE.

05:19.533 --> 05:21.233
BYE.

05:22.533 --> 05:25.067
ALL RIGHT,
IS IT MY IMAGINATION?

05:25.100 --> 05:27.500
DOES SHE LIKE YOU
THAT MUCH OR DOES SHE
DISLIKE ME THAT MUCH?

05:27.533 --> 05:31.167
OH, LESBIANS LOVE ME.
THEY LOVE ME.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.167
- HOW IS THAT?
- WELL, WHEN I FIRST
GOT TO L.A.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.200
YOU REMEMBER--
YOU KNOW PATTY,
MY FRIEND PATTY.

05:35.233 --> 05:36.733
- PATTY, YEAH.
- WELL, SHE'S A LESBIAN.

05:36.767 --> 05:38.067
- YES.
- YOU KNOW, SO, OBVIOUSLY,

05:38.067 --> 05:40.567
THEY TALK AMONGST THEMSELVES,
AND THE WORD GOT OUT

05:40.600 --> 05:42.700
THAT I'M A FRIEND
O' LESBIANS.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.767
- ( exclaims )
YOU'RE A FRIEND O' LESBIANS!
- YES, THEY KNOW THAT.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.967
SO THE COMMUNITY
HAS COMPLETELY EMBRACED YOU.

05:48.067 --> 05:51.133
TOTALLY EMBRACED ME.
COMPLETELY.

05:51.167 --> 05:53.100
MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER
COMMUNITY.

05:53.133 --> 05:55.067
INCLUDING JEWS.

05:55.067 --> 05:57.233
- READY? THIS WAY.
- HI, TWO. YEAH.

05:57.267 --> 05:59.733
( slow piano music
playing )

05:59.767 --> 06:02.267
OH, JEEZ.

06:03.867 --> 06:06.833
THE MEN'S ROOM KEY
FROM THE PRIVATE
INVESTIGATOR'S OFFICE.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.433
I FORGOT
TO BRING IT BACK.

06:08.467 --> 06:11.367
- I'M ALWAYS DOING THAT.
- HEY,

06:11.400 --> 06:13.633
CHECK OUT
THE BOW-TIE HERE.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.233
IT'S A SMART LOOK.

06:15.267 --> 06:17.500
I THINK I'M GONNA
GET ME ONE OF THOSE.

06:17.533 --> 06:19.567
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU OUGHTTA TRY
WEARING A BOW-TIE.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.900
- IT'D BE A GOOD LOOK
FOR YOU. HI!
- HI.

06:21.933 --> 06:23.300
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- GREAT!

06:23.333 --> 06:25.067
HEY, THANKS FOR SENDING
THE INVITE BACK.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.100
- OH, SURE. I'M EXCITED.
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BLAST.

06:27.133 --> 06:29.433
- IT'S GONNA BE--
ARE YOU COMING?
- EH...

06:29.467 --> 06:31.733
- TELL ME YOU'RE COMING.
PLEASE.
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.600
25 YEARS OF MARRIAGE!

06:33.633 --> 06:35.967
- ROSIE'S COMING.
- ROSIE O'DONNELL?

06:36.067 --> 06:38.967
AND I HAVE
LARRY DAVID'S PLACE CARD
RIGHT NEXT TO HERS.

06:39.067 --> 06:41.533
- REALLY? YOU'RE
SITTING ME NEXT TO HER?
- RIGHT NEXT TO HER.

06:41.567 --> 06:44.133
- YOU KNOW ROSIE O'DONNELL?
- I KNOW HER FROM NEW YORK.

06:44.167 --> 06:46.433
- WE USED TO HANG OUT
TOGETHER DOING COMEDY.
- YOU'LL HAVE A GREAT TIME.

06:46.467 --> 06:48.933
- JUST SEND
THE INVITATION BACK, OKAY?
- OH, THANK YOU.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.933
- I'LL SEE YOU GUYS THERE.
I'M EXCITED.
- BY THE WAY,

06:50.967 --> 06:53.433
- JODIE'S REALLY LOOKING GOOD.
- SHE DOES LOOK GREAT.

06:53.467 --> 06:55.533
- DOESN'T SHE LOOK GREAT?
- OH, THANKS A LOT, YEAH.

06:55.567 --> 06:57.567
SHE'S DATING A GUY.
I THINK IT'S SERIOUS.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.067
SHE'S DATING A GUY?!

06:59.067 --> 07:01.233
( chuckles )
YEAH, SHE'S NO LONGER GAY.

07:01.267 --> 07:04.500
( laughs )
WHAT? YOU'RE KIDDING!

07:04.533 --> 07:06.467
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

07:06.500 --> 07:08.667
CONGRATULATIONS!
GOOD FOR YOU.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.267
SHE'S NOT A LESBIAN
ANYMORE.

07:11.300 --> 07:14.133
OH MY GOD.
GOOD GOING.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.233
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU, UH, SOON.

07:16.267 --> 07:18.700
YEAH, I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE PARTY.

07:29.233 --> 07:32.500
LARRY, WE NEED TO TALK.

07:34.533 --> 07:36.300
IT'S OVER?

07:37.167 --> 07:39.567
WHAT'S OVER?

07:39.600 --> 07:41.067
THE MARRIAGE.

07:43.067 --> 07:45.067
WHY WOULD OUR MARRIAGE
BE OVER?

07:45.067 --> 07:46.333
YOU SAID,

07:46.367 --> 07:48.433
"WE NEED TO TALK."

07:48.467 --> 07:51.233
YEAH, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
MARTY FUNKHOUSER'S PARTY!

07:51.267 --> 07:54.300
( chuckles )
OH, OKAY. I THOUGHT--

07:54.333 --> 07:57.633
- EH, FORGET IT.
- NO NO NO, WHAT DID
YOU THINK?

07:58.967 --> 08:01.433
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU SAID,
"WE NEED TO TALK."

08:02.667 --> 08:04.200
GENERALLY,
WHEN COUPLES BREAK UP,

08:04.233 --> 08:06.433
THAT'S HOW THEY
INTRODUCE IT, YOU KNOW,
"WE NEED TO TALK."

08:06.467 --> 08:09.367
- SO I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS--
- WELL, WHY WOULD YOU--

08:09.400 --> 08:11.067
WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN THINK THAT?

08:11.100 --> 08:13.600
WELL, BECAUSE WOMEN
HAVE BROKEN UP WITH ME
MANY TIMES,

08:13.633 --> 08:15.800
AND THEY'VE ALWAYS
INTRODUCED IT WITH
"WE NEED TO TALK."

08:15.833 --> 08:18.800
SO I'M JUST
SORT OF CONDITIONED
FOR THAT RESPONSE.

08:18.833 --> 08:21.367
AND WHEN WOMEN
BROKE UP WITH YOU,

08:21.400 --> 08:23.833
DID YOU LIGHT UP
LIKE THAT?

08:23.867 --> 08:25.367
LIGHT UP?

08:25.400 --> 08:26.467
- YEAH.
- DID I LIGHT UP?

08:26.500 --> 08:28.967
( imitates )
"OH, IT'S OVER?"

08:29.067 --> 08:30.733
YOU KNOW,
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A DEFENSE MECHANISM.

08:30.767 --> 08:33.667
THAT'S HOW I REACT TO THINGS.
I GO THE OTHER WAY,

08:33.700 --> 08:37.400
SO I DON'T GET HURT.
I PROTECT MYSELF.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.300
YOU UNDERSTAND.
SO WHAT ABOUT THE PARTY?
MARTY FUNKHOUSER'S PARTY--

08:40.333 --> 08:42.200
HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE?

08:42.233 --> 08:45.167
NO! NOT AT ALL!
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.533
SO WHAT ABOUT
THE FUNKHOUSER PARTY?

08:48.567 --> 08:51.667
WELL, I WANTED TO KNOW
IF WE'RE GOING OR NOT.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.067
I NEED TO SEND IN
THE RSVP AND--

08:54.067 --> 08:56.600
I WASN'T GOING, AND NOW
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

08:56.633 --> 08:59.167
ROSIE O'DONNELL'S
GONNA BE THERE.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.367
OUR TABLE.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.967
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

09:03.067 --> 09:05.800
I MIGHT WEAR A BOW-TIE.

09:05.833 --> 09:08.467
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
- YOU'RE GONNA WEAR A BOW-TIE?

09:08.500 --> 09:11.467
- ARE YOU LOVING THAT?
IS THAT FANTASTIC?
- ( knocking )

09:11.500 --> 09:12.933
HOW ABOUT THAT
FOR AN IDEA, HUH?

09:12.967 --> 09:14.833
I, WELL--

09:14.867 --> 09:17.067
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

09:17.067 --> 09:19.100
- WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- WANDA!

09:19.133 --> 09:21.233
- LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

09:21.267 --> 09:22.800
WELCOME!
THIS IS OUR NEW HOUSE.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.833
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:24.867 --> 09:26.300
- OH, THE RENTAL HOUSE.
- THIS IS A RENTAL.

09:26.333 --> 09:30.100
IT'S JUST FOR A FEW MONTHS
UNTIL THE RENOVATION'S DONE.
YOU KNOW.

09:30.133 --> 09:32.633
SHIT, I MEAN,
YOU'RE RENTING,
SO I CAN BE HONEST.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.200
- Cheryl: YEAH, YEAH.
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

09:34.233 --> 09:36.133
- KINDA COLD, LIKE A HOTEL.
- YEAH.

09:36.167 --> 09:38.800
A HOTEL? HOTELS ARE GOOD.
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT
OF ACTIVITY

09:38.833 --> 09:40.600
IN THE HOTEL LOBBY.
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.

09:40.633 --> 09:42.800
WHY DON'T YOU PUT
A LITTLE BELLMAN'S CAP ON...

09:42.833 --> 09:44.833
- OKAY, I'LL PUT
A BELLMAN'S CAP ON.
- ...AND RUN AROUND.

09:44.867 --> 09:47.067
PUT A LITTLE CONCIERGE DESK
OVER THERE.

09:47.100 --> 09:50.067
- HEY, WANDA, LET ME
ASK YOU A QUESTION.
- WHAT?

09:50.067 --> 09:52.200
IS IT WRONG TO ASSUME

09:52.233 --> 09:55.967
THAT A BLACK MAN
WEARING A BOW-TIE
IS A MUSLIM?

09:56.067 --> 09:58.233
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
SOME BULLSHIT LIKE THAT?

09:58.267 --> 09:59.700
WHAT THE FUCK, LARRY?!

09:59.733 --> 10:02.267
I'M NOT YOUR LINK
INTO THE BLACK WORLD, OKAY?

10:02.300 --> 10:05.633
SO STOP ASKING ME
SHIT ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE
AND STUFF, ALL RIGHT?

10:05.667 --> 10:07.367
OKAY, BUT LET ME
ASK YOU THIS:

10:07.400 --> 10:09.767
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A BLACK MAN

10:09.800 --> 10:13.067
WEARING A BOW-TIE
WHO'S NOT A MUSLIM?

10:13.100 --> 10:15.567
- WHO GIVES A FUCK?
- IT'S JUST SOMETHING
YOU MAY HAVE OBSERVED.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.267
- HAVE YOU OBSERVED--
- LARRY, I DON'T--

10:17.300 --> 10:19.867
- HAVE YOU EVER OBSERVED
A BLACK MAN...
- LARRY, I DON'T--

10:19.900 --> 10:22.233
...WHO'S NOT A MUSLIM WEARING
A BOW-TIE? THAT'S ALL.

10:22.267 --> 10:24.767
YOU THINK FARRAKHAN
WENT OUT AND BOUGHT UP

10:24.800 --> 10:25.900
ALL THE BOW-TIES
OR SOMETHING?

10:25.933 --> 10:27.933
HE'S SITTING THERE
HOLDING ON TO BOW-TIES

10:27.967 --> 10:29.967
AND ONLY MUSLIMS GET 'EM?
WHAT THE FUCK, LARRY?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.067
YOU-- WHAT-- NO.
I DON'T KNOW.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.500
FAIR ENOUGH.
GOOD ANSWER.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.433
"I DON'T KNOW."
I TOTALLY ACCEPT IT.

10:35.467 --> 10:37.333
- I GOT THE DOG.
- THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE.

10:37.367 --> 10:40.367
- I KNOW, YOU'VE GOT
TO SEE HIM. SHERIFF!
- SHERIFF!

10:40.400 --> 10:42.900
- Larry: HELLO BOY!
- Wanda: HE'S A CUTIE!

10:42.933 --> 10:46.400
( growling, barking )

10:46.433 --> 10:49.733
- WHAT THE HELL--
- Larry: I THINK
IT'S YOU, WANDA.

10:49.767 --> 10:52.367
- ONE OF Y'ALL
WANNA GRAB CUJO?
- UM...

10:53.833 --> 10:56.167
COME ON, IT'S JUST WANDA.
IT'S JUST WANDA.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.733
I'M SORRY.
HE'S VERY FRIENDLY.

11:00.767 --> 11:02.133
WE'RE ALL DONE IN THERE.

11:02.167 --> 11:04.533
JUST, UH, YOU HAVE TO WAIT
OVERNIGHT FOR THE--

11:04.567 --> 11:06.867
HEY! HEY, LITTLE BUDDY.
COME HERE.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.067
Wanda:
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR DOG?

11:08.100 --> 11:10.067
I DON'T KNOW.
SEE HOW FRIENDLY HE IS?

11:10.067 --> 11:13.067
GOOD DOG!
HE PROBABLY SMELLS MY DOG.

11:13.067 --> 11:16.067
- ( growling, barking )
- Repairman #1: OH!

11:16.100 --> 11:17.900
- HEY! SHIT!
- Larry: OH MY GOD!

11:17.933 --> 11:19.600
- GOD!
- HEY, COME ON!

11:19.633 --> 11:21.333
- ( Repairman #1 laughs )
- GET OVER HERE.

11:21.367 --> 11:24.133
- WHAT'S WITH--
- I'M SO SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

11:24.167 --> 11:26.933
WHAT DID YOU DO?

11:26.967 --> 11:29.300
- I'M REALLY SORRY.
- IT'S OKAY.

11:29.333 --> 11:30.767
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

11:30.800 --> 11:34.133
- I'VE NEVER
SEEN HIM LIKE THIS.
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

11:34.167 --> 11:36.633
- YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.
- HUH?

11:36.667 --> 11:38.200
YOU HAVE A RACIST DOG!

11:38.233 --> 11:40.567
- THAT DOG HATES
BLACK PEOPLE.
- WANDA.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.200
LARRY, YOU TRAINED THE DOG
TO HATE BLACK PEOPLE?

11:42.233 --> 11:44.633
NO, I DIDN'T TRAIN IT
TO HATE BLACK PEOPLE.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.767
HAS IT BARKED
AT ANY WHITE PEOPLE?

11:46.800 --> 11:48.800
NO, HE'S-- HE'S--

11:48.833 --> 11:50.067
HE HASN'T BARKED
AT ANY WHITE PEOPLE.

11:50.067 --> 11:52.667
EXACTLY.
THE DOG IS RACIST.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.400
SHERIFF'S RACIST?

11:54.433 --> 11:56.067
SHERIFF?!

11:56.067 --> 11:58.300
THAT'S A PERFECT NAME
FOR A RACIST DOG.

11:58.333 --> 12:01.467
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS DOG,
THE KLAN MEETING OR SOMETHING?

12:01.500 --> 12:04.067
- LARRY PICKED HIM OUT
AT THE POUND.
- THE POUND.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.367
SHERIFF THE FUCKING DOG
THAT EATS BLACK PEOPLE.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.800
WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

12:08.833 --> 12:11.900
Y'ALL STAY HERE
AND PET YOUR CRAZY-ASS
RACIST DOG,

12:11.933 --> 12:13.867
BUT I AM NOT BRINGING
MY BLACK ASS

12:13.900 --> 12:16.333
BACK UP INTO THIS
FUCKING HOTEL

12:16.367 --> 12:19.667
UNTIL Y'ALL GET RID
OF THAT FUCKING KLAN DOG.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.800
GOT A KLAN DOG!

12:21.833 --> 12:24.500
LOOKING AT ME
LIKE I'M A DAMN T-BONE.

12:24.533 --> 12:26.933
- Cheryl: I'LL CALL YOU.
- AW, SHUT UP.

12:28.767 --> 12:31.300
- ( playing foxtrot music )
- ( people chatting )

12:36.833 --> 12:37.867
( people conversing
loudly )

12:37.900 --> 12:40.300
Waiter:
SO WE HAVE THREE CHOICES.

12:40.333 --> 12:42.900
I'M SORRY, THE FIRST
THAT WE HAVE IS

12:42.933 --> 12:44.900
A SKIRT STEAK...

12:44.933 --> 12:47.267
( talking loudly )

12:47.300 --> 12:49.333
LOOK, I CAN'T--
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

12:49.367 --> 12:51.367
I CAN'T HEAR.
COULD YOU REPEAT THAT?
WHAT'S THAT?

12:51.400 --> 12:53.367
IT'S A SKIRT STEAK, SIR,
OR STIR FRY,

12:53.400 --> 12:56.067
UH, AND THAT'S--
( voice drowned out )

12:59.467 --> 13:02.400
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

13:02.433 --> 13:05.067
EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU JUST
KEEP IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT?

13:05.100 --> 13:06.733
WE CAN'T HEAR THE WAITER.
WE'RE TRYING TO ORDER.

13:06.767 --> 13:08.767
- KEEP IT DOWN?
- WE'RE TRYING TO HEAR
THE WAITER.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.800
I'M TRYING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME
WITH MY FAMILY OVER HERE.
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

13:11.833 --> 13:13.700
I'M NOT KEEPING IT DOWN.
I'M SORRY,

13:13.733 --> 13:17.433
- WE NEED TO KEEP IT DOWN
FOR TUCKER CARLSON OVER HERE.
- ( laughing )

13:17.467 --> 13:19.567
"KEEP IT DOWN"!

13:21.933 --> 13:25.300
- TUCKER CARLSON?
- TUCKER CARLSON.

13:25.333 --> 13:28.133
Waiter:
THERE'S A CHICKEN ROTISSERIE

13:28.167 --> 13:31.267
AND A PORTOBELLO
MUSHROOM SALAD.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.300
- Susie: SALAD?
- YEAH, WELL THE PORTOBELLO

13:33.333 --> 13:36.567
IS CUT UP
ONTO MIXED GREENS.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.067
- Waiter:
ARE YOU A VEGETARIAN?
- Susie: YEAH, IT DEPENDS.

13:42.067 --> 13:43.733
- Jeff: SHE IS.
- Susie: YEAH.

13:43.767 --> 13:46.267
Waiter: SO THAT WOULD
SORT OF BE THE BEST CHOICE.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.467
I'M GONNA GET THE SKIRT STEAK.
WANT ME TO ORDER FOR YOU?

13:49.500 --> 13:51.233
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- GET ME THE CHICKEN.

13:51.267 --> 13:52.500
EXCUSE ME.

13:52.533 --> 13:55.900
UH, I'LL HAVE
THE PORTOBELLO, YEAH.

13:55.933 --> 13:59.833
- HEY, SUE.
- WHAT?

13:59.867 --> 14:01.433
WHAT'S WITH THE SNUB?

14:01.467 --> 14:03.267
OH, COME ON, LARRY.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.067
YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW?

14:05.067 --> 14:06.767
WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW WHY--

14:06.800 --> 14:08.400
WHAT?
WHAT DID I DO?

14:08.433 --> 14:10.433
ALL RIGHT, LET ME
GIVE YOU A CLUE, OKAY?

14:10.467 --> 14:13.233
STARTS WITH A "J"
AND IT ENDS WITH AN "I."

14:14.700 --> 14:16.367
JEDI?

14:16.400 --> 14:17.367
- YOU KNOW--
- WHAT?

14:17.400 --> 14:19.133
IT'S JODI, OKAY?

14:19.167 --> 14:21.067
WH-WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

14:21.067 --> 14:23.400
WELL, I HEARD THAT YOU
JUST GOT SO EXCITED,

14:23.433 --> 14:26.200
LIKE YOU WERE SO HAPPY
THAT SHE WASN'T WITH
WOMEN ANYMORE.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.067
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- IT'S NOT RIDICULOUS.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.633
- I WAS HAPPY FOR HIM.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO YOU.

14:30.667 --> 14:33.633
I WASN'T REALLY HAPPY
FOR HIM, I WAS PRETENDING
I WAS HAPPY FOR HIM.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.400
- OH REALLY?
- BUT THAT'S ALL.
I WAS JUST PRETENDING.

14:36.433 --> 14:39.133
- NO NO NO NO.
- NO, I WASN'T SINCERE.
I WASN'T SINCERELY EXCITED.

14:39.167 --> 14:42.067
- YOU'RE NOT
BEING SINCERE NOW.
- NO, NOW I'M BEING SINCERE.

14:42.100 --> 14:45.767
YOU KNOW,
THE LESBIAN COMMUNITY
USED TO REVERE YOU.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.300
- YOU USED TO BE SUCH
A LIBERAL GUY, LARRY.
- I'M LIBERAL.

14:48.333 --> 14:50.267
- NO, YOU'RE NOT LIBERAL.
- I AM LIBERAL.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.467
LOOK WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.
LOOK AT THE BOW-TIE.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.633
THE BOW-TIE--
I JUST TRIED OUT
A BOW-TIE, SO WHAT?

14:54.667 --> 14:57.400
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY.

14:57.433 --> 14:59.533
DON'T EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME
TALKING TO THIS MAN.

14:59.567 --> 15:01.867
THIS MAN IS A RACIST.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.867
HE HAS A RACIST DOG.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.333
HE HAS A DOG
THAT ATTACKS BLACK PEOPLE.

15:08.433 --> 15:10.367
OKAY, I DO--
THE DOG IS RACIST.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.067
- BUT I DIDN'T TRAIN
HIM TO BE RACIST.
- LARRY, FORGET ABOUT IT.

15:13.067 --> 15:14.900
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

15:14.933 --> 15:16.700
BECAUSE WE TALK, LARRY.

15:23.867 --> 15:26.333
ARE YOU HAVING FUN
OR WHAT?

15:26.367 --> 15:28.133
WHAT DID YOU TELL JODI?

15:28.167 --> 15:31.333
I TOLD HER
YOU WERE JUST MAYBE
A LITTLE OVERJOYOUS

15:31.367 --> 15:33.300
AT THE FACT THAT SHE
WAS DATING A BOY.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.633
- THAT'S ALL I SAID.
- ALL THE LESBIANS
HATE ME NOW.

15:35.667 --> 15:37.433
- OH, SO IT'S MY FAULT?
- YES IT IS!

15:37.467 --> 15:40.867
- YOU CELEBRATED!
- I WAS PRETENDING TO BE HAPPY
FOR YOUR BENEFIT.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.733
- I DON'T NEED BENEFIT!
- YOU NEED BENEFIT!

15:42.767 --> 15:44.500
- WHAT DO I
NEED BENEFIT FOR?
- YOU NEED BENEFIT.

15:44.533 --> 15:46.267
I'M HAPPY IF JODI'S HAPPY.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.567
- YOU'RE OVERBLOWING
THIS WHOLE THING.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.700
- WE'RE AT A PARTY.
- I DON'T LIKE BEING
SNUBBED BY LESBIANS.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.433
- IT'S THEIR PREROGATIVE.
- I'M THEIR BIGGEST SUPPORTER.

15:53.467 --> 15:55.300
- YOU'RE THEIR BIGGEST
SUPPORTER?
- YES I AM!

15:55.333 --> 15:57.367
WELL, THEY'RE IN TROUBLE THEN.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.500
BY THE WAY,
WHERE'S ROSIE O'DONNELL?

15:59.533 --> 16:01.967
SHE'S NOT HERE YET.

16:02.067 --> 16:03.567
SURE YOU INVITED HER?

16:03.600 --> 16:05.200
SHE'LL BE HERE.

16:05.233 --> 16:08.533
- WHEN?
- SOON.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.833
OKAY.

16:26.667 --> 16:29.967
DAN, DANNY,
COME OVER HERE.
I WANT YOU TO MEET SOMEBODY.

16:30.067 --> 16:32.200
THIS IS JODI'S NEW BOYFRIEND.
THIS IS LARRY DAVID.

16:32.233 --> 16:34.100
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

16:34.133 --> 16:36.533
- HAVE A GOOD TIME.
- ( chuckles ) OKAY.

16:36.567 --> 16:38.467
HEY, BY THE WAY,
YOU AND JODI--

16:38.500 --> 16:41.067
- FANTASTIC, GREAT NEWS.
- YEAH, YEAH.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.900
- PRETTY GOOD.
- YES IT IS INDEED.

16:42.933 --> 16:45.567
PRETTY, PRETTY,

16:45.600 --> 16:48.967
PRETTY, PRETTY GOOD.

16:49.067 --> 16:49.967
- YEAH.
- TERRIFIC.

16:50.067 --> 16:52.300
AND TO HAVE TO OVERCOME

16:52.333 --> 16:54.067
THE WHOLE SITUATION,

16:54.067 --> 16:55.833
THE WHOLE SEXUAL THING,
YOU KNOW?

16:55.867 --> 16:58.900
OH. OH, THERE'S NOTHING
TO OVERCOME, REALLY.

16:58.933 --> 17:02.067
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THE FACT THAT SHE'S BEEN
WITH WOMEN BEFORE YOU.

17:02.067 --> 17:04.867
- I KNOW--
- I'D BE REALLY
INTIMIDATED BY THAT,

17:04.900 --> 17:07.333
- BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
WE REALLY--
- INTIMIDATED?

17:07.367 --> 17:09.233
WELL, BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING

17:09.267 --> 17:11.400
AS MUCH AS THE WOMEN KNOW.
YOU KNOW, IT'S THEIR
EQUIPMENT.

17:11.433 --> 17:14.333
THEY OWN THE EQUIPMENT,
SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO
WITH IT.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.733
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON DOWN THERE?

17:15.767 --> 17:18.600
- I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA.
- I'D LIKE TO THINK I DO.

17:18.633 --> 17:23.067
THAT WHOLE AREA IS SO
MYSTERIOUS TO ME, YOU KNOW?

17:23.100 --> 17:25.500
- I'M JUST SAYING IT'S--
- WELL, I MEAN--

17:25.533 --> 17:28.400
( chuckles )
I'D BE INTIMIDATED,
I KNOW THAT.

17:32.067 --> 17:33.667
YEAH.

17:40.067 --> 17:42.933
I ALWAYS WONDERED,
DO YOU WALK AROUND IN
YOUR BIKINI AT HOME?

17:42.967 --> 17:46.233
- THE WAY HE TALKS,
YOU'D THINK THAT HE'S GOT--
- HEY.

17:46.267 --> 17:48.500
I THINK I WANT
TO GO HOME.

17:48.533 --> 17:49.800
LET'S GO HOME.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.900
NO, WE HAVEN'T EVEN
HAD DESSERT YET.

17:51.933 --> 17:54.067
SO WHAT?
WE DON'T NEED DESSERT.
COME ON.

17:54.067 --> 17:55.667
WELL, IT'S RUDE.
YOU STAY FOR DESSERT.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.233
- THEN YOU CAN GO.
- SO WHAT, DESSERT?
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

17:58.267 --> 18:01.800
- WE CAN JUST GO. COME ON.
- WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO HOME?

18:01.833 --> 18:05.467
I NEED TO USE
THE BATHROOM.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.200
- SO GO USE THE BATHROOM.
- I DON'T WANT TO USE
THIS BATHROOM.

18:08.233 --> 18:09.767
- I WANT MY OWN--
- WHY?

18:09.800 --> 18:12.100
THIS PROJECT DEMANDS
I GET BACK TO MY BASE.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.100
I NEED MY BASE.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.400
- WE'RE NOT GOING HOME--
- Jeff: WHAT'S THE MATTER?

18:16.433 --> 18:18.067
- LARRY WANTS TO GO HOME...
- WHAT--

18:18.067 --> 18:20.067
TO USE THE BATHROOM.
IT'S LIKE--

18:20.067 --> 18:22.133
CHERYL, YOU NEED TO TELL
THE WHOLE TABLE?

18:22.167 --> 18:23.667
- WHY DON'T YOU MAKE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT?
- HOLD ON HERE.

18:23.700 --> 18:27.067
YOU'VE NEVER DONE
THAT WITH ME AT LUNCH?
IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.900
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
HE CAN USE THIS BATHROOM.

18:29.933 --> 18:31.800
- THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY--
- YOU'RE A GENTILE.

18:31.833 --> 18:34.833
YOU'LL GO IN
THE MIDDLE OF FIFTH AVENUE.
IT'S DIFFERENT FOR JEWS.

18:34.867 --> 18:36.567
- NO, YOU'RE AT AN AFFAIR.
- WHAT?

18:36.600 --> 18:39.133
YOU CANNOT LEAVE
AN AFFAIR BEFORE
THE DESSERT IS SERVED.

18:39.167 --> 18:41.600
WHAT IS THIS DESSERT THING?
WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE AFTER.

18:41.633 --> 18:43.433
- WE CAN LEAVE BEFORE DESSERT.
- Jeff: BETTER TO LEAVE AFTER.

18:43.467 --> 18:45.467
NO, YOU DO NOT LEAVE
BEFORE DESSERT.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.300
WHO MADE THIS UP?
WHERE'S THIS RULE?

18:47.333 --> 18:49.967
EVERYBODY HERE SEEMS
TO KNOW, BUT THE RULES
DON'T APPLY TO YOU?

18:50.067 --> 18:52.500
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
SIT HERE FOR FOUR HOURS

18:52.533 --> 18:54.633
- AND BE UNCOMFORTABLE?
- SHOULD I GO CLEAN IT FOR YOU
BEFORE YOU GO IN THERE?

18:54.667 --> 18:57.200
- IT'S NOT EVEN
THE CLEANLINESS.
- OKAY, JUST GO.

18:57.233 --> 18:59.833
- IT'S NOT A CLEANLINESS ISSUE.
- WE DON'T NEED TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR BATHROOM--

18:59.867 --> 19:01.933
- SO JUST GO.
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S TELLING EVERYBODY

19:01.967 --> 19:03.900
- IN THE WHOLE PLACE!
- JUST GO!

19:22.200 --> 19:25.467
HEY, WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING, PAL?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:25.500 --> 19:29.067
( stuttering )
I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.400
- THAT'S A HANDICAPPED STALL.
- WE'RE WAITING IN LINE.

19:31.433 --> 19:34.100
( stuttering )
I HAVE A STUTTER,

19:34.133 --> 19:36.567
YOU PRICKS!

19:36.600 --> 19:39.267
STUTTER MY ASS!
THAT'S FOR PEOPLE
WHO CAN'T WALK.

19:39.300 --> 19:41.833
OH, ALL RIGHT, FINE, OKAY.

19:41.867 --> 19:44.433
OH, YOUR STUTTER'S GONE,
JACKASS!

19:44.467 --> 19:46.767
- GIVE ME A FUCKING
BREAK, ASSHOLE.
- STUPID ASS.

19:47.967 --> 19:49.767
Larry:
ALL RIGHT, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.433
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU
IN ABOUT 10-15 MINUTES.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.633
ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
HEY.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.967
- I'LL SEE YOU
IN A FEW HOURS.
- HUH? FEW HOURS?

19:57.067 --> 19:58.200
- YEAH.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

19:58.233 --> 20:00.067
- I'M MEETING JULIE.
- ( phone rings )

20:00.067 --> 20:03.067
- DON'T FORGET
TO TAKE THE DOG OUT.
- HELLO.

20:03.100 --> 20:06.267
OUT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
OUT FOR A WALK
OR OUT WITH ME?

20:06.300 --> 20:07.667
Jones:
Hello, Mr. David.

20:07.700 --> 20:10.600
- THIS IS OMAR JONES.
- OH, HI.

20:10.633 --> 20:13.800
I GOTTA TELL YOU, MR. DAVID,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
TAKING THE CASE,

20:13.833 --> 20:15.567
BUT I GOT A DISTRESSING
CALL TODAY

20:15.600 --> 20:17.667
ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR
LAST NIGHT AT THE BANQUET.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.533
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:19.567 --> 20:21.533
According to one
of the brothers, you said,

20:21.567 --> 20:23.267
"KEEP IT DOWN."

20:23.300 --> 20:25.867
NO NO, ALL THAT HAPPENED WAS
I WAS TRYING TO ORDER

20:25.900 --> 20:28.133
AND I COULDN'T HEAR
THE WAITER BECAUSE SOME
OF YOUR BROTHERS

20:28.167 --> 20:31.133
WERE MAKING TOO MUCH NOISE
AT THE NEXT TABLE, THAT'S ALL.

20:31.167 --> 20:33.133
How do you even know
about this?

20:33.167 --> 20:36.000
WE TALK, MR. DAVID.
WE TALK.

20:36.033 --> 20:38.800
- HUH.
- AND WHAT ABOUT
MY BATHROOM KEY?

20:38.833 --> 20:41.700
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I'M RETURNING IT TODAY,
I PROMISE.

20:41.733 --> 20:43.300
Well, like I said,
I'm gonna have to think
about it.

20:43.333 --> 20:45.133
THANK YOU.

20:48.533 --> 20:50.533
( barks )

20:52.667 --> 20:54.267
- ( barks )
- ( screams )

20:56.333 --> 20:58.133
HOW WAS EVERYTHING?

20:58.167 --> 20:59.300
- PRETTY GOOD.
- GREAT.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.700
DO YOU WANT COFFEE,
DESSERT, ON THE HOUSE?

21:01.733 --> 21:03.733
- ON THE HOUSE?
- YEAH.

21:03.767 --> 21:06.133
I'LL HAVE A CUPCAKE.

21:06.167 --> 21:08.467
- YEAH, I'LL TAKE
A DESSERT ON THE HOUSE.
- OKAY.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.267
- FABULOUS. THANK YOU.
- ARE THOSE NEW GLASSES?

21:11.300 --> 21:12.767
- NO, I JUST CLEANED THEM.
- ( laughs )

21:12.800 --> 21:15.467
IT'S NICE
TO HAVE YOU BACK, LARRY.

21:18.300 --> 21:21.500
YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE BACK
IN THE LESBIAN BOSOM.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.467
( waltz playing loudly )

21:40.933 --> 21:43.100
WOW.

21:43.133 --> 21:45.233
- I'M BACK.
- YOU ARE BACK.

21:45.267 --> 21:48.533
BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS,
BETTER THAN EVER.

21:48.567 --> 21:52.400
BUT WHAT-- I WONDER
WHAT TURNED IT AROUND.

21:55.100 --> 21:59.300
OH DEAR. UH-OH.

21:59.333 --> 22:00.567
WHAT?

22:00.600 --> 22:02.533
- WHAT DOES FUNKHOUSER WANT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

22:02.567 --> 22:05.800
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
HOW DID HE EVEN KNOW
I WAS HERE?

22:08.300 --> 22:10.633
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO DAN?

22:10.667 --> 22:13.067
WHAT DID I--
HELLO, BOY.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.633
- DID YOU MEET
SHERIFF, MY DOG?
- NO, I DIDN'T.

22:15.667 --> 22:19.200
I SAID, "DAN,
THIS IS LARRY DAVID."
THEN I LEFT YOU.

22:19.233 --> 22:20.800
- AND I SAID HI,
I SAID HELLO.
- YEAH, YEAH.

22:20.833 --> 22:23.900
- I SAID, "HI, DAN."
- YEAH, WHAT ELSE?

22:23.933 --> 22:27.067
YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE SMALL TALK,
"HI, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

22:27.067 --> 22:29.733
- WHERE ARE YOU FROM?"
AND ALL THAT.
- THAT'S IT?

22:29.767 --> 22:31.167
AND THEN, WHAT DID
I SAY? I SAID,

22:31.200 --> 22:35.367
"IT MUST BE HARD,
AS A GUY, TO FOLLOW--"

22:35.400 --> 22:37.767
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY,
"HELLO, I'M LARRY.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.800
- NICE TO MEET YOU"?
- I SAID THAT AFTER HI.
I SAID HI, THEN I SAID THAT.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.600
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
- PROBLEM?

22:43.633 --> 22:47.733
YEAH, PROBLEM.
NOW SHE'S BACK WITH A WOMAN.

22:47.767 --> 22:51.367
NO WONDER WHY
THEY'RE ALL BEING
SO NICE TO ME IN THERE.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.067
THEY'RE ALL SMILING AT ME.
OF COURSE, IT MAKES
PERFECT SENSE.

22:54.067 --> 22:56.200
- I WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING ELSE.
- UH-HUH.

22:56.233 --> 22:59.200
YOU LEFT MY PARTY
BEFORE DESSERT!

22:59.233 --> 23:00.633
HOW CAN YOU DO THAT?!

23:00.667 --> 23:02.600
IT'S NOT PROPER ETIQUETTE!

23:02.633 --> 23:06.600
I DON'T SUBSCRIBE
TO THE WAIT-FOR-DESSERT RULE

23:06.633 --> 23:07.900
BEFORE YOU CAN LEAVE A PARTY.

23:07.933 --> 23:11.133
YEAH, NO ONE CARES
WHAT YOU SUBSCRIBE TO, OKAY?

23:11.167 --> 23:14.633
WE WERE TRYING TO RECREATE
WHAT HAPPENED 25 YEARS AGO,

23:14.667 --> 23:17.600
AND I SAID,
"LARRY, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO MAKE A TOAST?"

23:17.633 --> 23:21.367
AND SOMEONE SAID,
"LARRY WENT HOME
TO TAKE A SHIT."

23:21.400 --> 23:23.067
AH.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.267
YOU STAY HERE.
OKAY, BOY?

23:31.300 --> 23:32.867
YOU STAY, SHERIFF.

23:40.700 --> 23:43.067
- HEY!
- HEY, LARRY.

23:43.067 --> 23:44.600
- HEY, HI!
- HOW ARE YOU?

23:44.633 --> 23:47.233
- GREAT.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

23:47.267 --> 23:48.967
HEY, BY THE WAY,
I DON'T KNOW

23:49.067 --> 23:52.533
IF YOU HEARD ANYTHING
ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN
GOING ON--

23:52.567 --> 23:55.600
- OH, COME ON, I HEARD.
RIGHT? I'M IN THE LOOP.
- YEAH, RIGHT. YEAH, YEAH.

23:55.633 --> 23:57.667
IT'S ALL RIGHT, THOUGH.
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD

23:57.700 --> 23:59.667
WORRY ABOUT IT. JUST--
IT'S ALL GOOD NOW.

23:59.700 --> 24:02.300
YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED
THAT DAY WAS

24:02.333 --> 24:03.933
I JUST GOT A
LITTLE EXCITED,
BUT NOT--

24:03.967 --> 24:06.567
HEY HEY HEY HEY, LARR.
I STOOD UP AT THE MEETING,

24:06.600 --> 24:08.467
I TOLD EVERYBODY,
"I KNOW THE GUY."

24:08.500 --> 24:10.333
I VOUCHED FOR YOU.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.733
- YOU'RE SOMETHING,
YOU KNOW THAT?
- COME ON, COME ON!

24:12.767 --> 24:14.767
- IT ALL WORKED OUT, RIGHT?
- IT'S GREAT.

24:14.800 --> 24:17.800
- LISTEN, SHE'S HAPPY,
WE'RE HAPPY, YOU KNOW?
- FANTASTIC.

24:17.833 --> 24:21.167
SHE'S BACK ON THE TEAM.
EVERYTHING'S GOOD.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.133
- FANTASTIC.
- ALL RIGHT.

24:23.167 --> 24:24.367
- HEY.
- YEAH.

24:24.400 --> 24:27.133
YOU KNOW, WE MISSED YOU
AT FUNKHOUSER'S PARTY.

24:27.167 --> 24:28.533
THE WHAT?

24:28.567 --> 24:31.667
MARTY FUNKHOUSER'S
25th ANNIVERSARY PARTY.

24:31.700 --> 24:33.633
- OH, JODI'S DAD?
- YEAH.

24:33.667 --> 24:36.067
YEAH, I DON'T REALLY
KNOW HIM. NO.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.733
- YOU WEREN'T INVITED TO THAT?
- NOPE, NO NO NO.

24:39.767 --> 24:42.367
WAS IT GOOD?
DID YOU GO?

24:42.400 --> 24:45.467
- YEAH, YEAH, I WENT.
- YEAH, IT WAS GOOD?

24:45.500 --> 24:47.567
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT OTHER THING.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.467
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,
GONE, LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.467
- OKAY? LIKE IT
NEVER HAPPENED.
- THANKS, SWEETHEART.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.400
- ALL THE LESBIANS LOVE YOU.
- OKAY, LOVE YOU.

24:54.433 --> 24:55.767
- I LOVE YOU BACK.
- LOVE YOU.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.800
I LOVE YOU.
EVERYONE LOVES YOU.
ALL OF US.

25:01.933 --> 25:04.067
( Eastern music playing )

25:05.067 --> 25:06.967
( knocks on door )

25:09.633 --> 25:11.300
YOU A A MUSLIM!

25:12.700 --> 25:14.833
GO, PRAY, PRAY.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.767
( sighs )

25:20.867 --> 25:22.400
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.633
ARE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
A LITTLE OVERLY SENSITIVE

25:24.667 --> 25:26.233
TO BEING TOLD
TO KEEP IT DOWN?

25:26.267 --> 25:28.867
BECAUSE I KNOW IN THE MOVIES
YOU GUYS TEND TO MAKE

25:28.900 --> 25:31.733
A LOT OF NOISE SOMETIMES.
AM I RIGHT?

25:31.767 --> 25:34.533
'CAUSE THAT'S KIND OF
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE PARTY.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.933
- ( sighs )
- WHAT, DID I--

25:36.967 --> 25:38.200
NO, GO BACK.

25:38.233 --> 25:41.533
DID I INTERRUPT
THE PRAYING?
I'M SORRY.

25:41.567 --> 25:43.367
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.300
- LISTEN, MR. DAVID--
- LOOK AT THE WAY YOU
FOLD THAT UP.

25:45.333 --> 25:47.067
IT'S LIKE A YOGA MAT, HUH?

25:47.067 --> 25:48.500
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

25:48.533 --> 25:51.600
THAT MUSLIMS ARE
A VERY FORGIVING PEOPLE.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.567
THEY ARE?

25:53.600 --> 25:56.533
- YES WE ARE.
WE'RE VERY FORGIVING.
- REALLY? HUH.

25:56.567 --> 25:58.433
- WELL, IT'S TRUE.
- THERE'S A LOT

25:58.467 --> 26:01.567
OF MESHUGANA MUSLIMS,
THOUGH, RUNNING AROUND,
ARE THERE NOT?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.733
BEING THAT WE ARE
A FORGIVING PEOPLE,
I HAVE DECIDED

26:03.767 --> 26:06.767
TO TAKE ON YOUR CASE.

26:06.800 --> 26:10.100
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE
TO CHARGE YOU

26:10.133 --> 26:12.167
A HIGHER RATE
THAN I CHARGE MOST PEOPLE.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.067
WELL, WHATEVER YOU HAVE
TO DO.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.600
- YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE CASE?
- I'M GONNA TAKE THE CASE.

26:17.633 --> 26:19.433
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

26:19.467 --> 26:21.300
DO MUSLIMS SHAKE?

26:21.333 --> 26:23.333
- YES, WE DO.
- YOU DO?

26:23.367 --> 26:24.833
- YES, WE DO.
- GREAT.

26:24.867 --> 26:26.933
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

26:26.967 --> 26:28.933
I'M VERY EXCITED
ABOUT THIS.

26:28.967 --> 26:31.067
THE WHOLE ADOPTION THING--

26:31.067 --> 26:33.233
I MEAN, THIS COULD BE
A HUGE THING FOR ME.

26:33.267 --> 26:34.933
ALL RIGHT, MR. DAVID.

26:34.967 --> 26:36.600
OH, GUESS WHAT.

26:36.633 --> 26:38.600
BATHROOM KEY.

26:38.633 --> 26:41.667
YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:41.700 --> 26:44.167
I GOTTA GO AGAIN.
I'M SO SORRY.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.567
- ALL RIGHT.
- ( door opens and closes )

27:11.400 --> 27:14.200
WELL, LOOKY HERE!

27:14.233 --> 27:16.533
LOOK WHAT'S DOING HERE!

27:17.567 --> 27:20.300
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE IN HERE?

27:20.333 --> 27:22.800
IT SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE
USING THE WRONG TOILET.

27:22.833 --> 27:24.633
SOMEBODY WAS IN THERE.
I HAD TO USE THE NORMAL ONE.

27:24.667 --> 27:26.733
REALLY?
FIRST OF ALL,

27:26.767 --> 27:30.267
WE DON'T LIKE
TO BE REFERRED TO
AS "NORMAL," OKAY?

27:30.300 --> 27:33.567
WE'RE "ABLE-BODIED."
"ABLE-BODIED," NOT "NORMAL."

27:33.600 --> 27:35.700
THAT'S LIKE FROM THE '80s.
WHO DOESN'T KNOW THAT?

27:35.733 --> 27:38.233
I HAD TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.
SOMEBODY WAS IN THERE.

27:38.267 --> 27:40.567
WELL, THEN YOU WAIT.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.067
YOU WAIT.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.167
ALL RIGHT, SHERIFF!

27:55.200 --> 27:57.867
OKAY, GOOD BOY!
GOOD BOY.

27:57.900 --> 27:59.733
MR. DAVID.

27:59.767 --> 28:01.933
MY BATHROOM KEY.

28:01.967 --> 28:04.467
( ominous music playing )

28:15.600 --> 28:16.667
HEY, NICE DOG.

28:16.700 --> 28:19.167
( screams )
NO, DON'T!

28:19.200 --> 28:22.800
I LOVE DOGS.
I HAVE A COUPLE OF MY OWN.

28:24.467 --> 28:26.067
ALL RIGHT,
JUST GIVE ME MY KEY.

28:26.067 --> 28:27.433
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I FORGOT.

28:27.467 --> 28:29.767
HOPEFULLY WE
WON'T HAVE TO KEEP GOING
THROUGH THE SAME THING.

28:29.800 --> 28:33.867
I'M SORRY.
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

28:33.900 --> 28:37.267
- NICE DOG.
- THANK YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.100
HEY!

28:39.133 --> 28:42.600
GOOD BOY, GOOD BOY!
YEAH!

28:42.633 --> 28:44.100
Rosie:
OH, LOOK!

28:44.133 --> 28:45.900
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A DOGGIE!

28:45.933 --> 28:48.067
( growls, barking )

28:50.167 --> 28:52.133
- SORRY.
