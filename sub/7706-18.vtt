WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:03.235
[humming]

00:07.375 --> 00:09.174
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.876
Why not?

00:10.878 --> 00:12.711
Because I might lose.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.214
I'm sorry.

00:15.716 --> 00:16.982
Check.

00:16.984 --> 00:18.384
[telephone ringing]

00:18.386 --> 00:21.286
Get that, Willie.
I wanna plan my next move.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.389
[ringing continues]

00:31.999 --> 00:33.966
Uh, hello.

00:33.968 --> 00:35.901
The who-meister?

00:36.904 --> 00:38.337
Oh. Yeah.

00:38.339 --> 00:40.472
Sure, just a minute.
Hang on.

00:40.474 --> 00:43.842
- It's for you.
- It must be Jody.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.177
Hello.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.346
Hey, Jod-meister.

00:47.348 --> 00:49.982
What's happening?

00:49.984 --> 00:51.750
I saw that, Willie.

00:52.987 --> 00:55.554
Your building's going where?

00:55.556 --> 00:58.257
Condo? Where's condo?

00:59.226 --> 01:01.393
Oh! Oh!

01:01.395 --> 01:03.762
Hey, it's no problem.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.832
Yeah, you could stay here
till you find a new place.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.669
Well, why would anybody mind?

01:10.671 --> 01:13.238
No, we have a slogan here,
"Welcome."

01:13.240 --> 01:15.607
It's on the mat outside.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.211
Uh, Willie sends his love.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.579
Okay, buh-bye.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.382
Hang that up,
will you, Willie?

01:23.384 --> 01:25.717
The mat outside says,
"Wipe your feet."

01:25.719 --> 01:29.421
Jody's blind. She'll never know.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.090
Don't you think you should
have checked with us

01:31.092 --> 01:33.725
before you invited her to stay?

01:33.727 --> 01:37.629
What for?
We banter back and forth.

01:37.631 --> 01:41.567
You'd do that frustrated
head rubbing thing

01:41.569 --> 01:43.235
and then you'd give in.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.904
This way we're spared,
all of that.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.539
[sighs]

01:55.316 --> 01:58.917
Hey, Lynn, you wanna
take over for Willie?

01:58.919 --> 02:00.552
Okay.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.825
- Your move.
- Okay.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.730
[laughing]

02:14.635 --> 02:16.535
Checkmate.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.043
[theme music]

03:24.238 --> 03:25.737
[instrumental music]

03:27.474 --> 03:29.007
It's not that
we don't want

03:29.009 --> 03:30.342
Jody to stay.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.877
It's just that
we have a rule

03:31.879 --> 03:33.078
and that rule is--

03:33.080 --> 03:36.381
No dating boys with vans.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.584
I don't think that rule applies.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.920
It is a good one, though.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.223
Look, you shouldn't
have invited a guest

03:44.225 --> 03:46.091
without asking us.

03:46.093 --> 03:48.794
Would you rather
I dated a boy with a van?

03:50.064 --> 03:51.997
Why can't Jody stay
for a few days?

03:51.999 --> 03:53.865
She needs a place.
What could happen?

03:53.867 --> 03:56.268
Well, for one thing she could
discover that--

03:56.270 --> 03:57.436
We know, we know..

03:57.438 --> 03:59.037
(all)
ALF's an alien.

03:59.039 --> 04:02.608
You know, I think it's time you
got that printed on T-shirts.

04:02.610 --> 04:06.178
- ALF, she could find out.
- But she won't.

04:06.180 --> 04:09.715
Look, I met her once
and she didn't find out then.

04:09.717 --> 04:13.185
As long as she doesn't get too
touchy-feely, we're okay.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.421
But she could find out.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.725
Look, you spent two or three
hours with her, we're talking

04:19.727 --> 04:22.060
about two or three days here.

04:22.062 --> 04:26.298
Two or three days? I told her
she could stay a month.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.799
Only a month.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.969
Well, actually I told her
she could stay forever.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.839
But I thought I'd break it to
you a month at a time.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.776
ALF..

04:37.778 --> 04:39.711
I think we should let Jody stay.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.447
Yeah, we put up
with your mother staying here.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.249
Well, that's true.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.884
Willie.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.387
Well, she does have that
nasal thing at night, Kate.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.988
Yeah, the he-e-e!

04:49.990 --> 04:51.423
[nasal]
He-e-e!

04:51.425 --> 04:52.791
[nasal]
He-e-e!

04:52.793 --> 04:55.093
Alright, alright.
We get the picture.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.829
Doesn't Jody have any other
friends she could stay with?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.998
Friends from this planet?

05:00.000 --> 05:04.936
No, she's very shy.
Just like me.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.072
You? Shy?

05:07.074 --> 05:09.808
You should have seen
Melmacians who were outgoing.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.544
It was a planet
of game show hosts.

05:14.114 --> 05:17.516
Look, I'm sorry, ALF,
we'd like her to stay..

05:17.518 --> 05:19.484
...but I'm afraid
it's just too risky.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.621
Well, how would you feel
if you were blind and homeless

05:22.623 --> 05:24.690
with no one to turn to?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.459
I think ALF has a point.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.361
You're darn right.

05:29.363 --> 05:30.996
What is it?

05:30.998 --> 05:33.765
That we can't turn our back
on someone who needs us.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.538
Well...alright.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.839
She can use the guest bedroom

05:40.841 --> 05:43.642
until she finds
a place of her own.

05:43.644 --> 05:47.846
Great! Great!
Thanks, Lynn. I owe you one.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.147
One?

05:49.149 --> 05:51.450
Well, one today.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.619
[instrumental music]

06:00.861 --> 06:01.893
Perfect.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.463
[lamp crashes]

06:04.465 --> 06:05.897
Almost perfect.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.667
What was that crash?

06:08.669 --> 06:10.802
A lamp fell off
the furniture.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.705
That leads to my
next two questions.

06:13.707 --> 06:17.008
A, what was the lamp doing
on a pile of furniture?

06:17.010 --> 06:18.677
And B..

06:18.679 --> 06:20.679
...why is the furniture
in a pile?

06:20.681 --> 06:22.414
Well, aren't you forgetting C?

06:22.416 --> 06:24.616
What are we having for lunch?

06:32.826 --> 06:34.993
Who piled up
all the furniture?

06:36.230 --> 06:39.197
ALF, why did you
pile up all the furniture?

06:39.199 --> 06:41.767
I stacked it to get it
out of Jody's way.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.902
She'll be safe as long as she

06:43.904 --> 06:45.937
stays out
of the falling-lamp zone.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.975
ALF, let's,
let's rethink this.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.512
Jody lived
in an apartment.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.881
Jody had furniture.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.784
Jody walked<i> around </i>
the furniture.

06:58.786 --> 07:02.287
See Jody.
See Jody run.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.122
Run, Jody, run.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.859
See the furniture.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.729
See the alien
move the furniture back.

07:10.731 --> 07:14.099
Move, alien...move.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.902
See the alien
throw out his back.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.604
See the alien blame the Tanners.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.973
Lawsuit, Tanners, lawsuit.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.411
I think the Jodster's here.

07:26.413 --> 07:29.080
Okay, everyone, stay calm.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.582
We are calm.

07:30.584 --> 07:33.118
Well, then,
show some enthusiasm.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.653
[knocking on door]

07:36.256 --> 07:39.558
Excuse me, I'm not sure
I have the right house.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.759
I'm looking for--

07:40.761 --> 07:42.894
Jod-meister!

07:42.896 --> 07:44.930
[chuckles]
This is the place.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.932
Uh, it's okay. Thanks.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.768
Come on in, Jody.
I'm Willie.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.437
Oh, the patriarch
of the Tanner clan.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.772
Sounds good to me.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.474
And-and this is my wife, Kate.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.575
- Hello.
- Kate, hi.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.510
And-and this is Lynn
and Brian.

07:58.512 --> 07:59.811
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- You too.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.113
- Hi.
- Jody, run around.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.049
You won't bump into anything.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.451
[chuckles]
Oh.

08:06.453 --> 08:08.119
Well, I-I hope you didn't
go to the trouble

08:08.121 --> 08:09.921
of rearranging the furniture.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.757
It was no trouble.
It was fun.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.760
It'll be even more fun
putting it back.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.896
Oh, well, then you could do it.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.833
Thanks for letting me
stay here.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.469
I hate to impose, but I-I
didn't know what else to do.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.504
Well, you're not imposing.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.606
No. We're glad you're here.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.641
And stay as long as you like.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.177
Yeah, ALF did.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.547
Well, thanks, but I'm sure I'll
be out of your hair in few days.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.883
That's what ALF said.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.219
[instrumental music]

08:46.660 --> 08:48.627
Five, four

08:48.629 --> 08:50.495
three, two..

08:50.497 --> 08:51.796
[imitating a buzzer]

08:51.798 --> 08:53.565
Time's up.
What's your guess?

08:53.567 --> 08:55.200
Uh, Swiss.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.902
Close, but no cigar.

08:56.904 --> 09:01.172
It's Monterey Jack,
Swiss' country cousin.

09:01.174 --> 09:04.509
Are you sure?
There are holes in this.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.378
I used a hole puncher.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.647
That's cheating.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.383
All's fair in love
and guess-the-cheese.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.818
[laughing]

09:13.820 --> 09:16.288
Let's play guess-the-belch.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.490
[belches]

09:18.492 --> 09:19.724
ALF.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.327
No, no.
You don't guess who belched.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.396
You guess what they ate.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.699
Oh, ALF..

09:27.701 --> 09:30.368
...why are there
little cheese<i> dots</i>

09:30.370 --> 09:32.203
in the living room?

09:32.205 --> 09:34.272
Well, I've never
heard that term before

09:34.274 --> 09:36.808
but I think
those are your children.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.379
ALF, did you do this
to the hole puncher?

09:41.381 --> 09:44.416
That explains
the little cheese<i> dots.</i>

09:44.418 --> 09:48.353
And why was today's newspaper
thrown into the trash?

09:48.355 --> 09:50.288
I don't know. Ask Kate.

09:51.525 --> 09:52.691
I am Kate.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.725
I know.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.460
I was hoping I'd confuse you

09:55.462 --> 09:57.329
and you'd forget the question.

10:00.133 --> 10:04.069
ALF, I thought you said
the paper didn't come today.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.038
Oh, what a tangled web we weave

10:07.040 --> 10:09.541
when we don't want
our guests to leave.

10:12.879 --> 10:15.413
Kate, Willie..

10:15.415 --> 10:17.816
...I'm sorry.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.584
Can someone please
read me the classifieds?

10:19.586 --> 10:20.619
Sure.

10:20.621 --> 10:21.920
Hey, you can't read those.

10:21.922 --> 10:25.757
They're classified. Ha! Ha! Ha!

10:25.759 --> 10:26.992
Oh, here's a good one.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.960
"Two bedroom, two bath."

10:28.962 --> 10:31.129
Give me that thing.
I'll find something.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.002
- Whoa! This looks good.
- What is it?

10:37.004 --> 10:39.838
Rib roast is a buck fifty nine
a pound.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.841
I can't live in a rib roast.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.977
Yeah, but would it be nice
if you could.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.247
Well, let me look here.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.116
Wait a minute, here's one, here.

10:51.118 --> 10:55.620
"Cozy one-bedroom, furnished,
wall-to-wall carpeting, view--"

10:55.622 --> 10:57.922
- Pass.
- Why?

10:57.924 --> 11:00.525
It says, "One month's security."

11:00.527 --> 11:03.328
After that you'd be in danger.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.797
I think I'll give him
a call anyway.

11:05.799 --> 11:06.865
What's the number?

11:06.867 --> 11:10.502
It's, uh, 5-5-5-7-3-3-9.

11:10.504 --> 11:13.171
Uh, 3-7-2-3-8-3-1.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.541
- ALF.
- Sorry. 5-6-9-2.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.980
If you keep acting like this

11:21.982 --> 11:23.648
Jody will move out.

11:23.650 --> 11:26.785
But Jody wants to move out.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.054
Well, this is all news to me.

11:29.056 --> 11:33.124
ALF, Jody is a grown woman.
She needs her independence.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.060
Oh, that's easy
for you to say.

11:35.062 --> 11:38.196
You know nothing
of the plight of blind people.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.365
- And you do.
- Yes!

11:40.367 --> 11:43.334
The other day,
I locked myself in the closet.

11:43.336 --> 11:49.340
Being blind is very dusty
and smells like boots.

11:49.342 --> 11:54.179
Jody survived for years without
us. She can do it again.

11:54.181 --> 11:57.215
I think she<i> wants </i>
to do it again.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.985
Fine. Think what thou wilst.

12:00.987 --> 12:02.921
Wilst?

12:02.923 --> 12:04.989
Jody's my pal.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.558
If she goes..

12:06.560 --> 12:08.093
...I go.

12:08.095 --> 12:11.362
[chuckles]
What are you saying?

12:11.364 --> 12:14.032
I'm saying if she goes, I go.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.901
Not a lot
of verbal clutter there.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.771
Well, now you're just
being ri-diculous, ALF.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.674
Jody could never take care
of you the way we have.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.243
Take care of me?

12:25.245 --> 12:26.678
Are you implying that I'm

12:26.680 --> 12:30.248
some sort
of house-bound<i> dilettante?</i>

12:30.250 --> 12:34.219
No, no, no..
Well, yes.

12:34.221 --> 12:38.356
For your information,
I'll be taking care of her.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.025
Jody needs me
like a hole in the head.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.963
Well, isn't that good
on your planet?

12:46.266 --> 12:49.734
Well, the apartment's available.

12:49.736 --> 12:53.238
What a coincidence! So am I!

12:53.240 --> 12:56.207
Hey, Lucky,
I'll be gone for a while.

12:57.711 --> 13:01.012
Gee, I've never seen
a cat smile before.

13:02.783 --> 13:04.716
[instrumental music]

13:04.718 --> 13:05.984
[lips smacking]

13:07.788 --> 13:09.354
[instrumental music]

13:12.225 --> 13:17.262
Well, at least ALF took the
time to leave us a note.

13:17.264 --> 13:22.600
[clears throat]
They say that breaking up is
hard to do.

13:22.602 --> 13:27.272
"Now I know,
I know that it's true.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.140
Don't say that this is the
end.."

13:29.142 --> 13:34.646
¶ Instead of breaking up I wish
that we were making up again ¶¶

13:37.450 --> 13:39.717
He didn't put as much effort
into this as I thought.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.523
[instrumental music]

13:51.998 --> 13:55.600
This book
doesn't have any words.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.368
It's got zits!

13:58.371 --> 14:00.772
Oh...must be one of those

14:00.774 --> 14:02.707
connect-the-dot books.

14:07.314 --> 14:10.415
Oh, great,
a picture of spaghetti.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.718
Hi, groceries.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.654
I mean, hi, Jody.

14:16.656 --> 14:19.157
Hi, ALF. Whatcha doin'?

14:19.159 --> 14:22.493
Oh, I'm playing with one of your
connect-the-dot books.

14:22.495 --> 14:26.564
I drew the spaghetti.
You could draw the meatballs.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.399
Or the red wine.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.069
Uh..

14:31.972 --> 14:34.505
ALF, this is a Braille book.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.741
You see, these dots,
they represent letters.

14:36.743 --> 14:39.244
You rub your fingers over them
and you can read the book.

14:40.680 --> 14:41.713
Uh, well, wouldn't that

14:41.715 --> 14:44.082
rub all the fur
off your fingers?

14:44.751 --> 14:46.050
What?

14:46.052 --> 14:49.587
Uh, well,
if you had furry fingers.

14:49.589 --> 14:50.889
[Jody laughing]

14:50.891 --> 14:53.858
You know, you say
some of the strangest things.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.560
Oh, well, it's no big deal.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.896
Uh, it doesn't mean
that I'm weird or anything.

14:57.898 --> 15:02.433
Uh, I'm just a regular, average
being from your planet.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.569
[laughing]

15:04.571 --> 15:07.505
I know that.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.775
But there is something I wanted
to talk to you about.

15:10.777 --> 15:12.277
Well, shoot.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.246
Well, um..

15:15.248 --> 15:20.752
[chuckles]
You're a man and I'm a woman..

15:20.754 --> 15:22.520
And..

15:22.522 --> 15:25.223
Well, I hope you're not gonna
try anything funny. Are you?

15:25.225 --> 15:28.192
Oh, you mean like putting
whipped cream in your shoes?

15:28.895 --> 15:31.796
Well, I might.

15:31.798 --> 15:36.301
[chuckles]
You know, ALF,
I really don't understand you.

15:36.303 --> 15:40.772
You don't have a job.
You never leave the house.

15:40.774 --> 15:44.809
Well...I guess I better
tell you the truth.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.110
Oh, please.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.478
I'm old.

15:48.882 --> 15:51.215
I'm real old.

15:51.217 --> 15:54.052
Older than the Gabor sisters.

15:54.054 --> 15:57.622
Well...maybe not Zsa Zsa.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.491
Oh...well,
you're-you're very spry.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.160
Well, that's 'cause
I've cut my fat intake

16:02.162 --> 16:04.796
down to 90% of my diet.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.265
[Jody laughing]

16:07.267 --> 16:09.267
That reminds me,
I'd better go start dinner.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.436
Oh, no, no, no.
I'll handle dinner.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.571
I'm supposed
to take care of you.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.246
Hello, Pizza Barge?

16:22.248 --> 16:24.849
Yeah, send over
a large pepperoni.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.919
- ALF, we're on a budget.
- Oh, right.

16:27.921 --> 16:30.855
Uh, charge it to the Tanners.

16:30.857 --> 16:33.291
We've imposed
on the Tanners enough.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.860
Again, you're right.

16:35.862 --> 16:37.695
Charge it to Donald Trump.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.199
Hello? Hello?

16:46.272 --> 16:48.272
What? Vegetables again?

16:48.274 --> 16:49.974
That's not food.

16:49.976 --> 16:52.377
That's the stuff food eats.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.513
It's what I eat.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.515
What about real food?

16:57.517 --> 17:00.685
Like the stuff
you hit with your car in Texas?

17:02.789 --> 17:05.857
Well, I'd like you
to try my spinach<i> lasagna.</i>

17:05.859 --> 17:08.393
And, uh, meanwhile,
you can make yourself useful

17:08.395 --> 17:10.395
by setting the table.

17:10.397 --> 17:14.532
Hey, no problem.
It's taken care of.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.468
I'm here
to make your life easier.

17:18.638 --> 17:19.704
[glass shatters]

17:20.840 --> 17:22.206
Uh..

17:22.208 --> 17:24.175
...first, I'll sweep up
that glass

17:24.177 --> 17:26.544
that spontaneously exploded.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.418
[instrumental music]

17:36.322 --> 17:38.389
(Jody)
'ALF!'

17:38.391 --> 17:41.259
'Why are there little hills
in the hallway?'

17:41.261 --> 17:43.194
They're speed bumps

17:43.196 --> 17:46.097
so you don't go too fast.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.066
Well, I tripped over one.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.001
You must have been speeding.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.338
ALF, what are you doing?

17:54.340 --> 17:57.208
I'm making this house safe
for the sightless.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.410
Well, it was safe.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.280
Now it's an obstacle course.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.383
[chuckles]
You know,
we've really gotta

18:05.385 --> 18:07.385
find a way
to keep you occupied.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.220
Well, I found one.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.723
I'm putting curb feelers
on your shoes.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.525
ALF, I have never
scraped my ankles

18:14.527 --> 18:15.927
against a curb.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.396
Pure luck.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.565
ALF, when you, uh,
first moved in here

18:20.567 --> 18:22.066
you said you were
only going to stay

18:22.068 --> 18:26.270
until I was settled.
I really think I'm settled.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.406
No, no, no.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.741
I'll tell you
when you're settled.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.945
Oh.
Of course, you would know best.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.218
Uh, listen, ALF, um..

18:40.220 --> 18:41.652
...I left my keys
in the bedroom.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.488
Could you go get them
for me, please?

18:43.490 --> 18:46.991
Hey, no problem,
my little Venetian blind.

18:53.933 --> 18:54.932
[thud]

18:54.934 --> 18:57.135
(ALF)
'Ow, you stupid speed bump!'

18:57.137 --> 18:58.970
'You're for her, not me!'

19:00.473 --> 19:03.875
Hello, Willie.
Oh, it's Jody.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.011
Yes.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.281
Yes!

19:10.283 --> 19:12.483
Yes. That's the problem exactly.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.652
[instrumental music]

19:14.654 --> 19:16.120
B.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.822
E.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.290
E.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.758
T.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.027
Hah hah!

19:23.029 --> 19:25.096
This Braille stuff is easy.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.033
ALF, I'm going down
to the laundry room.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.702
Okay. Just follow the rope.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.141
[clanking]

19:37.143 --> 19:39.477
Ow! Ow! Kate, Willie!

19:39.479 --> 19:41.712
I hurt my finger!

19:42.982 --> 19:45.082
What am I doing?
They're not here.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.386
I'll have to kiss it myself.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.021
[lips smack]

19:51.291 --> 19:53.357
It's not the same.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.026
[doorbell rings]

19:55.028 --> 19:56.327
Who is it?

19:56.329 --> 19:58.162
(Kate)
'It's us, ALF!'

19:58.164 --> 19:59.497
Kate!

19:59.499 --> 20:01.832
And here I just
kissed my own finger.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.134
Come on in.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.103
Hi, ALF.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.573
Hey, guys.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.008
What brings you
to this independent, carefree

20:11.010 --> 20:12.710
neck of the woods?

20:12.712 --> 20:15.179
Oh, we-we just,
we thought we'd drop by

20:15.181 --> 20:17.582
and see how
things were going.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.418
Well, come on in.
Get the full picture.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.853
It looks great.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.223
And...very..

20:25.225 --> 20:27.425
...self-explanatory.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.195
So what have you
been doing with yourself?

20:31.197 --> 20:33.264
Labeling vegetables.

20:33.266 --> 20:36.334
Boy, I'd hate to be the guy
who had to pound out

20:36.336 --> 20:38.636
"War And Peace" in Braille.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.372
ALF?

20:41.374 --> 20:43.374
Jody called us.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.409
Well, why would she do that?

20:45.411 --> 20:48.846
Jody wants to live
her own life, ALF.

20:48.848 --> 20:52.416
She thinks it's time
for you to come home.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.585
Well, that doesn't
sound like Jody.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.021
Maybe it was
another blind person

20:57.023 --> 20:58.990
who got a wrong number.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.226
Uh, I don't think so, ALF.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.262
Oh.

21:04.264 --> 21:08.132
Well...if that's the way
Jody wants it.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.102
I'm back, ALF.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.137
Hey, Jody,
don't take off your clothes.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.472
We have company.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.440
- ALF!
- Hi, Jody, it's us.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.541
- Hi, Jody.
- Oh, hi.

21:17.543 --> 21:18.909
It's-it's-it's the Tanners.

21:18.911 --> 21:19.910
[laughing]

21:19.912 --> 21:21.579
Hey, enough of the yakety-yak.

21:21.581 --> 21:24.382
Kate and Willie,
can you give us a minute alone?

21:24.384 --> 21:26.417
Oh, sure, uh..

21:26.419 --> 21:28.419
Where would you
like us to yakety-yak?

21:28.421 --> 21:30.655
- Um...in the bedroom.
- Okay.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.590
Just follow the signs.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.125
And make yourself useful.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.994
Label Jody's socks.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.996
(Willie)
'Oh, careful, honey,
speed bump.'

21:40.400 --> 21:41.799
Jodster..

21:41.801 --> 21:43.934
...I've been thinking.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.937
It's time for me
to go back to the Tanners.

21:46.939 --> 21:47.972
Really?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.840
Well, you knew
from the beginning

21:49.842 --> 21:52.910
that this was only
a temporary arrangement.

21:52.912 --> 21:54.912
I told you
as soon as you were settled

21:54.914 --> 21:56.781
I'd have to go.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.784
Well, I'm settled.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.987
- Well, I guess I'm going.
- ALF.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.157
Before you go..

22:07.293 --> 22:08.793
...I wanna thank you.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.127
I don't know
how I could have gotten

22:10.129 --> 22:12.863
through these past few weeks
without you.

22:12.865 --> 22:16.200
- Oh, hey. It was nothing.
- Nothing?

22:16.202 --> 22:18.202
Not everybody can label an egg.

22:19.138 --> 22:20.171
Well, it's easier

22:20.173 --> 22:22.206
when you hard-boil them.

22:22.208 --> 22:24.308
Took me a couple of dozen
to figure that out.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.444
[Jody laughing]

22:26.446 --> 22:28.612
Oh, um, before you go..

22:30.450 --> 22:32.717
...I want you to have this.

22:32.719 --> 22:33.718
Wow!

22:33.720 --> 22:35.886
My very own Braille book!

22:38.191 --> 22:40.991
And you drew in
the meatballs for me.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.226
[laughing]

22:42.228 --> 22:44.995
Well, I wanna go show this
to Kate and Willie.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.731
Kate! Willie!

22:53.172 --> 22:55.172
Pizza?

22:55.174 --> 22:56.741
(ALF)
'Where? Where?'

22:56.743 --> 22:58.509
[thud]
Oh!

22:58.511 --> 23:00.711
These speed bumps work great.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.681
Kate! Willie! I hurt my knee!

23:03.683 --> 23:05.349
Can you kiss it?

23:05.351 --> 23:07.585
[instrumental music]

23:09.555 --> 23:10.921
[instrumental music]

23:13.593 --> 23:15.359
Lucky..

23:15.361 --> 23:16.861
...I'm going to show you

23:16.863 --> 23:18.662
what it's like to be plunged

23:18.664 --> 23:20.931
into a world of darkness.

23:22.869 --> 23:25.736
- ALF!
- Oh, Kate, just in time!

23:25.738 --> 23:28.339
The cat almost got my tongue.

23:28.341 --> 23:30.207
Give me this cat!

23:30.209 --> 23:32.143
Bad, Lucky! Bad!

23:33.913 --> 23:36.247
Now I know
how Wile E. Coyote feels.
