WEBVTT

00:05.790 --> 00:07.190
Huh?

00:08.290 --> 00:09.590
What do you think?

00:09.630 --> 00:11.960
Am I gonna make a great Dinah the Determined Duck or what?

00:11.990 --> 00:13.960
Yeah, absolutely. But, uh...

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
...I'm just glad this movie's animated

00:16.000 --> 00:18.710
because Dinah's not wearing any pants.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.250
Wait a second.

00:21.870 --> 00:24.410
If she's not wearing pants, where am I gonna put my lipstick?

00:24.440 --> 00:26.750
Oh, girl, if she's going all "el buffo,"

00:26.750 --> 00:28.040
she is gonna have to have a purse.

00:28.080 --> 00:30.310
And maybe some heels.

00:30.350 --> 00:32.090
Might make those legs look longer

00:32.090 --> 00:33.650
and minimize the big fat duck butt.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.650
Do not go dissin' Diney's hiney.

00:35.690 --> 00:38.990
On page 86, she hip-checks the evil farmer out of the way

00:39.020 --> 00:41.790
with her bodacious ba-duck-a-donk!

00:41.820 --> 00:43.730
There she is, yes!

00:43.760 --> 00:46.230
Hannah, baby, absolute thrill to be directing you.

00:46.260 --> 00:48.930
Baz B. Berkley! But please, call me Triple B.

00:48.970 --> 00:50.970
Thank you for having me here, Triple B.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.800
Or should I say Buh-Buh-Buh.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.870
OK. I've heard that a million times,

00:55.870 --> 00:57.910
but because it's you, I'm gonna laugh. Ha!

00:57.940 --> 01:00.810
By the way, is the purple pixie really here

01:00.840 --> 01:02.180
or am I just over-tired?

01:03.280 --> 01:04.780
Oh, no, that's my best friend, Lola.

01:04.810 --> 01:06.850
Hi! I'm a big fan of your movies.

01:06.880 --> 01:10.390
<i>Over the Ledge,</i> <i>Jolt...</i> I just love you.

01:10.420 --> 01:13.190
Of course you do. Look at you, you're a walking cartoon.

01:14.490 --> 01:17.560
Don't frown, I'm saying that with love. OK? OK. So!

01:17.590 --> 01:19.090
- Wanna meet your co-stars? - Absolutely.

01:19.130 --> 01:20.700
Wonderful. Come on in!

01:20.730 --> 01:23.600
Hannah Montana, I'd like you to meet...

01:23.630 --> 01:25.760
...Granny Goat, Claude the Crabby Cow

01:25.760 --> 01:27.600
and Frankie the Frantic Field Mouse.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.110
Hello, Hannah.

01:30.140 --> 01:32.670
Not in the moooooood.

01:32.710 --> 01:35.180
I like cheeeeeeese!

01:36.380 --> 01:38.680
Hi, I'm Kyle McIntyre.

01:38.710 --> 01:40.340
Man, it must get ugly at your house

01:40.340 --> 01:42.050
when there's only one cookie left.

01:42.080 --> 01:45.790
Not really 'cause... Frankie likes cheeeeeese!

01:45.820 --> 01:47.420
Oy.

01:47.460 --> 01:49.520
OK, so we've all met. Wonderful.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.230
What do you say we get this rehearsal started,

01:51.260 --> 01:53.190
my little overly-paid barnyard beauties.

01:53.230 --> 01:55.260
Again, I say that with love.

01:55.970 --> 01:57.730
OK.

01:57.770 --> 01:59.830
OK, why don't you sit down? Wonderful.

01:59.870 --> 02:04.070
Dinah? Dinah? Where is that mmm-miserable duck?

02:04.110 --> 02:06.040
She's climbing to the top of the barn again.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.680
She's tryin' to learn to fly!

02:07.710 --> 02:09.610
She wants to earn some pie?

02:09.650 --> 02:12.210
Tell her to clean out my stall!

02:12.250 --> 02:16.790
You can do it, Dinah. You can fly, you can fly!

02:16.820 --> 02:18.200
Whoa, hold up, hold up.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.660
Hannah, honey, what's with the voice?

02:21.690 --> 02:23.430
Oh, I'm sorry, was that too emotional?

02:23.430 --> 02:24.360
I mean I don't wanna scare the kids.

02:24.390 --> 02:26.260
Exactly. None of us want to scare kids, OK?

02:26.300 --> 02:27.680
'Cause then they run out of the theater,

02:27.680 --> 02:28.660
I get angry letters from parents,

02:28.660 --> 02:30.630
they close my movie down... Next thing you know,

02:30.630 --> 02:32.290
I'm back to directing regional theater

02:32.290 --> 02:33.640
starring "he's still alive?"

02:33.670 --> 02:37.270
and "she looks horrible!" I don't need that.

02:37.310 --> 02:41.380
I think one of those three B's is for "boing!"

02:41.410 --> 02:44.510
OK. What I need, what I want, what the kids want

02:44.550 --> 02:47.680
is a duck that sounds somewhat duck-ish.

02:47.820 --> 02:50.730
Oh, I'm sorry. When the studio offered me the job,

02:50.760 --> 02:53.260
I thought they wanted a celebrity voice

02:53.260 --> 02:55.760
that sounded somewhat... me-ish.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.500
Hannah, sweetie, cookie,

02:57.500 --> 02:58.830
if I wanted to have someone sound like you,

02:58.870 --> 03:01.100
I'd have Kyle do it. Kyle, do Hannah.

03:01.140 --> 03:04.770
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:04.810 --> 03:09.080
- Whoa! That was cool! - Not really hearin' it.

03:09.110 --> 03:12.010
Anywho, look, if you want a duck, I'll give you a duck.

03:12.050 --> 03:13.850
- Lead me in, Kyle. - You got it.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.850
She wants to earn some pie?

03:15.880 --> 03:18.550
Tell her to clean out my stall.

03:18.590 --> 03:23.820
You can do it, Dinah. You can fly, you can fly.

03:23.860 --> 03:25.030
Quack!

03:26.660 --> 03:28.100
Quack!

03:30.000 --> 03:36.074

03:37.890 --> 03:40.500
You get the limo out front.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.380
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color.

03:45.730 --> 03:48.800
Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun.

03:49.600 --> 03:53.620
It's really you but no one ever discovers.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.220
Who would've thought that a girl like me

03:57.470 --> 04:02.900
Would double as a superstar?

04:03.640 --> 04:07.470
You get the best of both worlds.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.490
Chill it out, take it slow,

04:09.600 --> 04:11.370
then you rock out the show.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.380
You get the best of both worlds.

04:15.670 --> 04:18.250
Mix it all together and you know that

04:18.260 --> 04:21.070
It's the best of both worlds.

04:21.350 --> 04:24.840
Hannah Montana  S03E26  Come Fail Away

04:25.320 --> 04:27.590
You can do it, Dinah.

04:27.620 --> 04:33.160
You can fly, you can fly.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.330
How was that?

04:34.360 --> 04:37.530
Kinda like the garbage disposal with a salad fork in it.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.770
Dang, I stink at this.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.440
I mean, the director acted all nice,

04:43.470 --> 04:45.010
but I saw that look on his face.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.810
You know, the look of disappointment and total embarrassment.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.310
Kinda like the look I give Jackson...

04:51.350 --> 04:53.180
...well, pretty much 24-7.

04:56.350 --> 04:59.790
Uh, Mile, would you like your own slice of pizza?

04:59.820 --> 05:03.020
Dad, please, I'm way too upset to eat.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.490
I can see that.

05:04.530 --> 05:06.490
What am I gonna do?

05:06.530 --> 05:09.760
I would say if you keep working on it, you'll get it.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.300
Really?

05:12.330 --> 05:14.800
Like I said, you just keep working on it.

05:16.070 --> 05:18.770
I'm a duck.

05:18.810 --> 05:21.040
I'm a duck.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.410
I'm a dead duck.

05:25.010 --> 05:27.950
- Hello? - Hey, Hannah, it's Kyle.

05:27.980 --> 05:30.350
I was calling to see how it was going with the voice.

05:30.390 --> 05:35.090
Oh! My duck is great. My duck is awesome. My duck is...

05:35.120 --> 05:39.060
- Cooked, roasted, stuffed? - All of the above.

05:39.090 --> 05:40.780
I know exactly how you feel.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.660
I had to do the voice of a duck once,

05:42.700 --> 05:44.300
so I hired a duck coach.

05:44.330 --> 05:47.230
- A duck coach? - He's amazing.

05:47.270 --> 05:48.440
I'll make a call.

05:50.140 --> 05:53.070
Kyle says you're the best in the business, so do your stuff.

05:55.710 --> 05:57.040
OK, for what I'm paying you,

05:57.050 --> 05:58.510
you're gonna have to give me more than that.

05:58.550 --> 05:59.580
Go!

06:04.890 --> 06:07.490
I'm gonna be needing a discount.

06:19.940 --> 06:21.740
Jackson Rod Stewart,

06:21.740 --> 06:24.840
how many times do I have to tell you to replace the...

06:27.510 --> 06:31.700
Uh, Mile? If this is your way of asking for a puppy,

06:31.700 --> 06:33.050
you win.

06:33.080 --> 06:37.890
Dad, I'm just trying to find my inner duck...

06:38.820 --> 06:41.020
...and I'll take a beagle. Quack!

06:41.060 --> 06:42.820
You really think that'll work?

06:42.860 --> 06:44.530
It worked for Kyle.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.890
He said before you even think about doing the voice,

06:46.930 --> 06:48.600
you really gotta study the animal.

06:48.630 --> 06:50.000
And then, when you're in front of the mic,

06:50.030 --> 06:51.470
it'll just come right out of you.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.220
As long as you clean up anything that

06:53.220 --> 06:54.840
comes out of that duck, waddle away.

06:56.710 --> 06:58.060
Now, where's that barnyard

06:58.060 --> 06:59.540
animal I call my son?

06:59.570 --> 07:02.040
He's at the beach.

07:03.950 --> 07:06.780
One normal child, is that too much to ask?

07:13.990 --> 07:16.790
That's right, I'm a college man.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.460
- Really?  - Yep!

07:18.490 --> 07:22.160
Studying at the universi-tay.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.470
That's u-n...

07:26.230 --> 07:28.470
...iversi-tay.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.010
I'm independent, don't answer to anyone...

07:32.040 --> 07:36.480
Well, except that cute little diapered angel called Cupid.

07:43.050 --> 07:44.280
Aren't you gonna get that?

07:44.320 --> 07:47.860
No, it's just my... uh, roommate, Robby.

07:47.890 --> 07:51.930
Yeah. Musician. You know the type. A little flaky.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
First, he doesn't listen to me,

07:55.530 --> 07:57.260
now he won't even pick up the phone?

07:57.300 --> 07:59.070
I'm sick of that boy duckin' me!

07:59.980 --> 08:03.670
Oh, relax! He didn't mean anything by it.

08:05.070 --> 08:08.010
- Hey, Rico, I'll take a water.  - Take a number.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.180
Take a number? Since when?

08:11.210 --> 08:12.180
Just take one.

08:12.210 --> 08:14.420
Fine. Hey, Rico, I'm number six.

08:15.880 --> 08:21.120
Number six, your water is ready. Number six.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.890
OK, what was the point of that?

08:22.920 --> 08:25.030
I'm trying to class up the place.

08:26.260 --> 08:29.260
Number four, your veggie burger is ready.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.370
Number four.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.980
Number four,

08:33.980 --> 08:37.669
get your stinkin' veggie burger before I spit in it!

08:42.780 --> 08:44.580
Oh, yeah, much classier.

08:46.310 --> 08:49.150
I don't know what I'm gonna do this summer, I mean,

08:49.180 --> 08:54.420
bicycle through France, maybe surf Costa Rica.

08:54.460 --> 08:57.120
It's great being my own man. Because, as I said,

08:57.160 --> 08:59.490
I answer to no one.

08:59.530 --> 09:02.030
Jackson Rod Stewart!

09:02.060 --> 09:04.260
Cool sunglasses. Can I try 'em?

09:06.070 --> 09:09.440
- Jackson! - And maybe your hat.

09:09.470 --> 09:14.140
- What're you doing? - Having fun. Being my own man.

09:14.180 --> 09:16.580
Let's talk like girls. Come on!

09:16.610 --> 09:20.550
Those are nice shoes. Where'd you get 'em? They're so cuuuute!

09:20.580 --> 09:24.750
- Excuse me, ladies. - Not interested. Taken.

09:24.790 --> 09:28.160
Uh, Jacksina, can I have a word with you for a second, please?

09:29.520 --> 09:34.900
Hey, Robby, Rob-oh, Rob-bop-a-lu-bop-ba-bing-bang-boomo.

09:36.870 --> 09:40.570
That's my roommate. Probably needs to borrow some money.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.980
Why don't you wait over there?

09:41.980 --> 09:43.670
I don't want to embarrass him...

09:43.710 --> 09:47.310
- ...like he's embarrassing me! - Oh, yeah!

09:47.340 --> 09:49.770
Said the guy in the floppy sunflower hat

09:49.770 --> 09:52.150
with the girlie glasses.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.380
What do you want, Dad?

09:54.420 --> 09:57.280
I'm right in the middle of something important here.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.690
So was I! And now, thanks to you,

09:59.690 --> 10:02.490
we're out of cotton balls.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.860
And you gotta start answering your phone when I call you.

10:04.890 --> 10:07.160
Well, I'm sorry, Dad, but at my age,

10:07.200 --> 10:09.260
it's a little embarrassing when "daddy" keeps calling.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.800
Can't you just, like, text me?

10:10.830 --> 10:13.570
I don't know how to do all that textin' and tweetin'

10:13.600 --> 10:16.140
and your face and my face, and all that stuff.

10:17.170 --> 10:19.110
Could you please just learn?

10:19.140 --> 10:21.110
I don't need you calling me to rag on me

10:21.140 --> 10:23.110
whenever I forget to replace the toilet paper,

10:23.140 --> 10:25.550
or I don't make my bed or I...

10:25.580 --> 10:27.410
...don't take my dinosaur vitamin!

10:30.150 --> 10:31.950
Uh, they're chewable

10:31.950 --> 10:34.560
and have one percent real fruit juice, so...

10:36.120 --> 10:40.890
I'm sorry, I usually get paid for babysitting.

10:46.600 --> 10:50.870
"Replace the dang TP, smiley face, smiley face."

10:52.170 --> 10:54.310
I taught him how to do the smiley face.

10:59.810 --> 11:03.650
I may be an old goat, but I can still kick your...

11:08.790 --> 11:11.330
When you commit to something, you don't mess around.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.330
Yeah, well anything to get this voice right, it's... ugh.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.590
I didn't know this was gonna give me

11:15.590 --> 11:18.270
such a nasty feather wedgie.

11:19.030 --> 11:20.430
Sorry I'm late, everybody.

11:20.470 --> 11:22.600
The whole lobby's talking about some wacky girl dressed in a...

11:22.640 --> 11:25.840
Hey! There she is. Hannah!

11:25.870 --> 11:27.770
Yeah, well, this is the kind of commitment

11:27.770 --> 11:29.540
you get when you hire Hannah Montana.

11:29.580 --> 11:33.550
Just you wait 'til you hear that duck voice explode out of me!

11:33.580 --> 11:35.380
You know what? I love it, I'm excited, let's do it,

11:35.420 --> 11:37.480
let's quack'n'roll! Sweet. OK.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.950
Kyle, why don't you kick us off from the goat.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.820
And... go.

11:42.860 --> 11:45.130
She wants to earn some pie?

11:45.160 --> 11:48.130
Tell her to clean out my stall!

11:48.160 --> 11:52.430
You can do it, Dinah! You can... oh, boy.

11:53.530 --> 11:56.870
I'm sorry. Hmm. Isn't that the same voice?

11:58.270 --> 12:00.140
Well, yes. But see, uh,

12:00.170 --> 12:02.380
I just wanna show you how far I've come.

12:02.410 --> 12:03.090
So just wait,

12:03.090 --> 12:05.280
this voice is about to explode out of me right now.

12:05.310 --> 12:06.950
Here we go!

12:10.850 --> 12:13.050
You can do it, Dinah.

12:13.090 --> 12:15.090
You can fly!

12:15.990 --> 12:17.920
Oh, cheese and quackers!

12:19.490 --> 12:22.600
OK. I'm thinking, and this is just out loud,

12:22.630 --> 12:24.060
you need a little more practice.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.730
And I'm thinking that you need a different duck.

12:26.770 --> 12:28.940
I think it'd be better for everyone if I just quit.

12:28.970 --> 12:31.000
OK, whoa. Hannah, honey, hold on,

12:31.000 --> 12:32.070
let's think about this.

12:32.110 --> 12:34.680
There's nothing to think about. You obviously need someone

12:34.710 --> 12:38.550
who can walk the walk or, you know, waddle the waddle,

12:38.580 --> 12:40.250
and I'm just not your girl.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.880
So please let me leave here while I still have my dignity.

12:54.550 --> 12:57.580
Why couldn't I do it? I've never quit anything before.

12:57.620 --> 13:00.820
I can't believe this! I've never been this bad at anything.

13:00.850 --> 13:04.390
Aw, come on, of course you have.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.090
Remember soccer and volleyball,

13:07.130 --> 13:09.060
and... Oh, they're still talking about that time

13:09.090 --> 13:11.230
you got stuck climbing the rope in gym class.

13:11.260 --> 13:13.660
"Somebody call the fire department!

13:13.700 --> 13:17.600
Somebody call the fire department!"

13:17.640 --> 13:21.540
- It was scary. - You were this far off the ground!

13:21.570 --> 13:25.540
And you came to comfort me. Now please do your job.

13:25.580 --> 13:28.480
- Poor Miley. - Better.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.580
When did Dad learn how to text?

13:34.620 --> 13:37.550
"How go D Duck? Bet U gr8."

13:37.590 --> 13:40.490
Hey, did you get my text?

13:40.530 --> 13:44.160
Did ya see how I spelled great? G-R number eight!

13:45.460 --> 13:47.330
Did you know you could do that?

13:47.370 --> 13:48.710
It works with other words, too,

13:48.710 --> 13:52.600
like Fascin-8. Exfoli-8.

13:52.640 --> 13:57.010
- Irrit-8.- Well, W-Y-P-B.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.180
That's "What's your prob, Bob?"

14:00.210 --> 14:01.910
I added the Bob part.

14:01.950 --> 14:04.110
- Ooh, I like that. - Ooh! T-Y, Lilly.

14:04.150 --> 14:06.420
- Yeah! - That's "thank you."

14:06.450 --> 14:09.450
Daddy, I quit the movie.

14:10.820 --> 14:12.020
What?

14:16.160 --> 14:19.600
- You quit? - I had to. I was horrible.

14:19.630 --> 14:21.570
Well, at least you can look yourself in the mirror

14:21.600 --> 14:23.830
and know that you gave it your very best shot.

14:23.870 --> 14:25.170
Yes, I can.

14:25.200 --> 14:29.310
You must've worked on that thing for a whole 24 hours.

14:30.610 --> 14:33.880
Uh, minus the trip to the mall,

14:33.910 --> 14:38.680
meals, sleep, carry the one...

14:39.980 --> 14:43.520
You slaved over that voice for an hour and 28 minutes.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.820
I'm exhausted just adding it up.

14:45.860 --> 14:50.160
- You forgot the Saturday stache wax. - Oh, thank you.

14:51.530 --> 14:55.170
That takes it down to a good 55-56 minutes you put into it.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.230
Daddy, please. I don't need this right now.

14:57.270 --> 14:58.380
Hey, fine.

14:58.380 --> 15:02.170
I'm not gonna sit here and rattle off some big speech.

15:02.210 --> 15:06.580
Thank you.

15:06.610 --> 15:10.080
Oh, yeah. So much for not giving me a big speech.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.420
But, you're right,

15:14.450 --> 15:17.290
I didn't give it my best shot.

15:19.860 --> 15:23.630
And I really should ask for a second chance.

15:23.660 --> 15:29.000
Good... number four, letter U.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.670
- Dad, I'm right here. - Oh, but it's so dang much fun!

15:40.550 --> 15:42.210
What about this voice?

15:42.250 --> 15:46.080
You can do it, Dinah. You can fly, you can...

15:48.490 --> 15:50.050
Raisin.

15:50.090 --> 15:53.560
Why can't the principal ever stay home sick?

15:53.590 --> 15:56.760
Ugh, my head is more stuffed than the original Lassie.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.430
There were six of them, you know.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.670
Walk away, walk away!

16:07.140 --> 16:08.870
OK, what do you think about this?

16:12.180 --> 16:14.080
You can do it...

16:15.480 --> 16:18.050
Walk away, walk away!

16:22.290 --> 16:27.190
Oh no, I'm getting clammy. This can't be good.

16:29.030 --> 16:32.660
Why can't I do this? Please, help me. Send me a sign!

16:32.700 --> 16:36.930
How many times must I tell you no running in the halls?

16:39.670 --> 16:41.750
Thank you!

16:48.580 --> 16:50.380
- Are you making fun of me? - Are you making fun of me?

16:50.410 --> 16:53.520
- You are making fun of me! - You are making fun of me!

16:53.550 --> 16:55.880
She had the mystery meat for lunch and

16:55.880 --> 16:57.150
hasn't been quite right since.

16:57.190 --> 17:00.260
Walk away, walk away, walk away.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.829
That's right, I'm a college man.

17:06.859 --> 17:11.640
- Really? - Yep, studying at the universi-tay.

17:11.670 --> 17:14.900
That's u-n-i-v...

17:17.010 --> 17:19.440
...ersi-tay.

17:20.810 --> 17:28.180
"Jackson... when letter-R letter-U home?"

17:30.720 --> 17:35.030
Uh, excuse me, I'm getting another text.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.370
Perfect.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.870
"Pick up some eggs."

17:46.900 --> 17:51.470
Independent. Don't answer to...

17:51.510 --> 17:56.150
...anyone. Just hold that thought.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.150
"K."

18:01.620 --> 18:07.620
"Plus sign, some gr-8-ed cheese."

18:13.430 --> 18:17.700
"U hate gr-8-ed cheese."

18:19.070 --> 18:24.110
"But I like to type gr-8-ed cheese."

18:27.610 --> 18:31.780
- You are so not worth this. - No! No, come on, I just...

18:34.220 --> 18:36.790
Enough already!

18:40.680 --> 18:41.830
Yello?

18:41.860 --> 18:46.160
You are out of control, mister!

18:46.200 --> 18:49.130
Look, this morning you texted me "Going running."

18:49.170 --> 18:52.670
Then it was "I-M texting, plus sign, running."

18:52.700 --> 18:54.870
Then it was "I fell down."

18:54.910 --> 18:58.010
Then it was "Don't worry, I-M, smiley face."

18:58.040 --> 19:00.110
Well this is not a smiley face!

19:01.480 --> 19:03.550
I'm pointing at my face!

19:03.580 --> 19:06.780
Look, Dad, I promise from now on I'll answer your phone calls.

19:06.820 --> 19:10.520
Just stop texting me! I've learned my lesson!

19:10.550 --> 19:12.920
Why does that boy always think

19:12.920 --> 19:14.490
I'm trying to teach him a lesson?

19:14.530 --> 19:16.090
I just like texting.

19:17.500 --> 19:23.470
"Hey Mom, how R-U? I like gr-8-ed cheese!"

19:28.170 --> 19:29.740
You can do it, Dinah.

19:29.770 --> 19:33.010
You can fly, you can fly.

19:33.040 --> 19:36.450
Look at me! I'm flying! I'm flying!"

19:36.480 --> 19:39.050
And... scene.

19:39.080 --> 19:43.490
Wow, yes! Yes, yes, yes! A million times better.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.290
Thank you! I knew if I tried my best I could do it.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.050
And you did.

19:47.050 --> 19:49.530
Unfortunately, your best, still not good.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.830
Wait, what? You said I was a million times better.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.230
True, true, true.

19:54.270 --> 19:58.170
But, from where you started, a million times better is still,

19:58.200 --> 20:00.040
how do I say this... "eh."

20:00.970 --> 20:02.170
You liked it, right, Kyle?

20:02.210 --> 20:05.680
Well, I, um...

20:05.710 --> 20:08.580
Kyle, Mom wants you out here right now!

20:08.610 --> 20:09.950
Sorry, gotta go.

20:09.980 --> 20:11.750
Mom, I'm coming!

20:11.780 --> 20:15.350
OK, so, again, Hannah, a real joy working with you

20:15.390 --> 20:17.590
- and I say that with... - Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:17.620 --> 20:19.660
This is not the way that it's supposed to happen!

20:19.690 --> 20:21.400
See, first I think I'm good.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.090
Then I find out from you I'm bad.

20:23.130 --> 20:25.500
Then I try to give up, listen to my daddy's advice,

20:25.530 --> 20:27.560
then I work really hard, knock it out of the park

20:27.600 --> 20:29.870
and then thank you at the Academy Awards!

20:29.900 --> 20:32.040
- Did you park in the structure? - Yeah.

20:32.070 --> 20:34.600
OK. The girl's gonna validate you on the way out.

20:34.640 --> 20:35.310
You know what?

20:35.310 --> 20:38.480
You may think I'm walking out of here a loser,

20:38.510 --> 20:42.050
but I'm not. I am the winner because I tried my best.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.710
And that's all you can do in this crazy, mixed up world.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.540
And you know what? Maybe I didn't get this job,

20:46.540 --> 20:47.150
but I'll get the next one.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.680
And if I don't, I'll get the one after that,

20:48.680 --> 20:50.550
because Hannah Montana does not quit.

20:50.590 --> 20:52.090
Good day, Triple B!

20:57.560 --> 21:00.830
Aw, come on! Seriously,

21:00.830 --> 21:02.600
this is where you hear the heartfelt speech,

21:02.630 --> 21:04.610
give me another chance,

21:04.610 --> 21:06.370
and then I thank you at the Academy Awards.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.760
Wow, yes. You know what, that's great.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.910
And this is when I say: "They lock the structure at five."

21:13.080 --> 21:15.080
I just wanted to make kids laugh.

21:15.110 --> 21:17.950
- OK, can I get security? - I'm going, I'm sorry!

21:21.620 --> 21:23.450
hey Rico I'll take a fruit smoothie.

21:23.490 --> 21:27.220
All right. This'll buzz you when it's ready.

21:27.260 --> 21:29.460
Is this one of those pagers that vibrates?

21:29.490 --> 21:30.730
What happened to the microphone?

21:30.760 --> 21:33.600
Didn't work. I'd call people, they'd ignore me,

21:33.630 --> 21:36.400
I'd yell and it would ruin the peace and tranquility

21:36.430 --> 21:38.400
of the Rico's dining experience.

21:38.440 --> 21:43.570
- This is much more effective. - OK.

21:51.150 --> 21:54.220
That's a little strong, don't ya think?

21:54.250 --> 21:56.990
I'd like to see them ignore me now.

22:04.360 --> 22:08.570
Dance, monkeys, dance! Mwah-hah-hah-hah!
