01:20.081 --> 01:23.667
- Sunhi!
- Hi! How've you been?

01:23.834 --> 01:27.963
Hi! It's been so long
since we met.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.507
It has.

01:30.174 --> 01:33.344
I came to meet
Professor Choi Dong-hyun.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.471
Have you seen him?

01:35.638 --> 01:39.016
No, I haven't.

01:39.183 --> 01:42.186
He must've stepped out.
His phone's off, too.

01:42.353 --> 01:46.690
Oh! He went on
a business trip abroad.

01:46.816 --> 01:50.402
- I see.
- A few days ago.

01:51.237 --> 01:52.196
When's he coming back?

01:52.321 --> 01:56.951
I'm not sure.
Probably soon.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.704
Let's go. I'll buy you
a cup of coffee.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.123
No, thanks. I'll just go.

02:02.248 --> 02:05.876
I want to ask you something.
Have some coffee, then go.

02:06.043 --> 02:09.046
Ask me what?
I'd better go.

02:09.171 --> 02:13.551
- Don't leave like that.
- I have somewhere to go.

02:43.581 --> 02:44.748
Professor!

02:45.082 --> 02:49.545
- What brings you here?
- Didn't you go abroad?

02:49.670 --> 02:52.173
Me? Why would I?

02:52.298 --> 02:55.384
Sangwoo said you went
on a trip abroad.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.760
- He did?
- Yes.

02:56.927 --> 03:00.264
Why would he?
He was just with me.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.228
Have a seat.

03:06.604 --> 03:10.149
- Anyway, it's good we met.
- I guess.

03:10.274 --> 03:14.195
So, what brings you
out to school?

03:14.695 --> 03:18.741
I was just passing by.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.121
Have you been well?

03:25.206 --> 03:27.708
They said you
went into hiding.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.502
- Who?
- That's what the students say.

03:30.628 --> 03:32.087
Why would I go into hiding?

03:32.213 --> 03:35.424
Because you don't keep
in touch with anyone.

03:36.634 --> 03:40.638
Let's see... 2 years? 1 year?

03:41.305 --> 03:43.515
Has it been a year
since we met?

03:43.641 --> 03:48.187
I did many things.
I've been diligent.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.688
I see.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.112
Actually, I have
a favor to ask.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.867
Could you write me
a reference letter?

04:02.284 --> 04:05.663
- Planning to study abroad?
- Yes, I'm looking into it.

04:05.788 --> 04:08.165
- Where?
- The States.

04:11.001 --> 04:14.463
It'll take at least 3 years
to study abroad.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.466
- You want to go to grad school?
- Yes.

04:18.342 --> 04:21.428
When you come back,
you'll be 31 or 32.

04:22.846 --> 04:27.059
- You want to make films, right?
- Yes, I will eventually.

04:27.685 --> 04:30.688
But now I want to stay
in school more.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.399
I want to study.

04:34.608 --> 04:39.363
Isn't it better to learn from
actually making films?

04:43.158 --> 04:44.827
Though it's hard...

04:45.327 --> 04:50.749
I think you should try
to go all the way.

04:50.874 --> 04:54.128
You think you'll buy time

04:54.253 --> 04:55.963
by going to school and such.

04:56.088 --> 05:01.677
Then, you can make self excuses

05:01.802 --> 05:05.014
not to go all the way.

05:05.139 --> 05:11.061
You find it hard working

05:11.228 --> 05:13.480
with others in productions.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.566
So without results,

05:15.733 --> 05:19.278
you're bound to get weary.

05:20.571 --> 05:25.743
But you can't make films without
working with people, right?

05:25.909 --> 05:29.997
You should keep trying
to work with others.

05:30.122 --> 05:32.791
Come out and
mix with others.

05:32.916 --> 05:38.213
And learn to live along
with them, though it's hard.

05:38.756 --> 05:39.840
Right?

05:40.966 --> 05:43.886
Well, I guess.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.556
But Professor...

05:48.057 --> 05:50.934
It took me long
to decide this

05:51.060 --> 05:53.437
and I've taken
measures already.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.940
It's too late to give up now.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.152
- Really?
- Yes.

06:01.904 --> 06:05.449
Okay. When do
you need it by?

06:05.616 --> 06:08.577
The sooner the better.
Aren't you busy?

06:08.702 --> 06:13.540
No, I'm not busy.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow?

06:14.541 --> 06:18.295
- Come by tomorrow.
- Okay! I can come.

06:18.420 --> 06:22.591
1 o'clock? 2 o'clock?
How about 1 o'clock?

06:22.716 --> 06:25.302
Great. Thank you.

06:25.469 --> 06:29.390
No problem.
But I can't lie.

06:29.515 --> 06:33.769
If you don't like my reference,
you don't have to use it.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.105
I'll just write what I know.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.609
Okay. Thank you very much.

06:49.701 --> 06:53.831
- Hi, Sunhi.
- Why did you lie?

06:53.956 --> 06:56.959
- What?
- Professor Choi went abroad?

06:57.167 --> 07:00.003
Oh, that. Did you meet him?

07:00.129 --> 07:02.047
Why'd you say
he wasn't here?

07:02.172 --> 07:04.007
You're so weird!

07:04.174 --> 07:08.011
I was just joking.
It was for fun.

07:08.137 --> 07:09.346
Why're you yelling?

07:09.513 --> 07:12.182
You think that's funny?
You're weird!

07:12.307 --> 07:15.602
How can you
call that a joke!

07:15.727 --> 07:18.147
I just wanted to
play a joke on you.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.816
I wanted you to laugh.
It's nothing!

07:20.941 --> 07:22.484
How is that nothing!

07:22.609 --> 07:24.903
I was just kidding. Really.

07:25.028 --> 07:30.284
Sunhi, you're so innocent.
I shouldn't joke with you.

07:30.409 --> 07:33.370
I'm not innocent! Stop joking.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.539
No, you are innocent.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.167
The most innocent girl
I've ever seen.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.127
You really are weird.

07:40.252 --> 07:43.046
Just say, you're sorry.
Don't make excuses.

07:43.172 --> 07:47.217
Be honest.
just apologize to me now!

07:49.011 --> 07:54.975
Fine. I'm sorry.
I was wrong.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.083
May I take your order?

09:43.584 --> 09:46.795
- Just A bottle of beer, please.
- What would You like?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.715
- Anything would be fine.
- Okay.

10:01.018 --> 10:05.230
But we only serve
beer with chicken.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.940
Really?

10:07.274 --> 10:12.571
I'm so full. Can't I
just have the beer?

10:12.696 --> 10:16.074
I'm sorry. You'll have
to order chicken.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.373
Okay, then.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.695
- Taking the subway?
- Yes.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.322
I'm taking the bus.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.616
- Aren't You late for the train?
- Not yet.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.160
- When will You return from Busan?
- Tomorrow night.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.662
Really?

11:01.787 --> 11:04.456
Should I call
even if it's late?

11:04.581 --> 11:08.168
Sure. Let's have
dinner together.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.922
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
- No, I'm the thankful one.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.758
- Have A safe trip.
- Bye.

11:14.883 --> 11:15.634
- Take care.
- Bye.

11:15.759 --> 11:16.802
Bye.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.685
<i>Kim Munsu!</i>

11:26.395 --> 11:27.771
<i>Kim Munsu!</i>

11:29.773 --> 11:31.441
<i>Kim Munsu!</i>

11:33.443 --> 11:35.112
<i>Look! Over here!</i>

11:36.988 --> 11:39.866
Sunhi! What are
you doing there?

11:40.742 --> 11:42.119
Come here!

11:43.286 --> 11:44.663
Come up!

11:45.872 --> 11:48.417
Okay. Sure.

12:03.682 --> 12:05.016
What are you doing?

12:05.600 --> 12:08.895
I got mad over some
crazy guy, so I'm drinking.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.815
It's been so long.

12:13.608 --> 12:18.196
Why'd you come
by the school?

12:18.321 --> 12:21.992
I was just passing by.

12:23.702 --> 12:29.499
- I saw your film.
- You did?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.085
You shouldn't have.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.380
Didn't you use our
story a bit much?

12:36.840 --> 12:39.342
Is it our story?

12:43.180 --> 12:45.348
- Would You like to order?
- A bottle of Soju.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.350
I'll be right back.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.105
What's with her?

12:52.481 --> 12:54.900
She was really rude
to me before.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.944
What a crazy bitch.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.576
She goes to our school.

13:05.202 --> 13:06.495
Are you drunk?

13:06.995 --> 13:09.122
You didn't drink much.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.708
Are you still in grad school?

13:12.375 --> 13:14.669
Stop studying.
Why're you still there?

13:15.504 --> 13:21.718
I have 1 semester left.
I hate it, too. It seems useless.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.470
You're a director now.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.348
So, why go to school?

13:28.767 --> 13:32.896
Oh, right. With that degree,
you can become a professor.

13:34.064 --> 13:35.524
Maybe.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.403
That's a big maybe.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.868
Why'd you change so much?

13:49.621 --> 13:52.207
Acting so serious after
becoming a director?

13:52.332 --> 13:55.877
Seeing you coming in,
you looked so haughty.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.630
Stop it. It's gross.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.340
No, I'm not.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.260
I looked like that?

14:04.469 --> 14:07.556
It's not the beer talking?

14:08.598 --> 14:12.769
I've never seen a decent man
who changes with little success.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.105
Be yourself.

14:15.438 --> 14:19.860
Don't act so big. Relax.

14:21.903 --> 14:24.030
I didn't become anything.

14:24.406 --> 14:29.452
I made that film with
my money. I spent $10,000.

14:30.495 --> 14:33.039
And hardly anyone
saw my film.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.625
I know.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.087
So, don't change.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.091
People try to
change too much.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.970
What change? When you
don't even know yourself?

14:52.183 --> 14:56.980
So, I want to go somewhere
else after I finish school.

14:58.607 --> 15:03.778
People in film aren't normal.
They're all crazy.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.158
Stop making excuses
and focus on one thing.

15:08.283 --> 15:10.619
Going to school or running away,

15:10.744 --> 15:13.121
they're all excuses.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.789
Keep at it all the way.

15:14.915 --> 15:18.668
Then, you'll know your limits
and find out who you are.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.255
Here you are.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.811
Let's d rink together.

15:47.906 --> 15:50.033
Anyway, I'm glad to see you.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.203
When I see you,
I always drink.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.206
You make me want to drink.

15:56.831 --> 15:57.874
I do?

16:31.241 --> 16:33.576
I really missed you.

16:34.828 --> 16:38.540
- We drank too much.
- I really missed you.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.835
You're lucky to see me.

16:45.046 --> 16:49.759
- You saw my film, right?
- Yes. It was okay.

16:51.761 --> 16:52.971
You...

16:54.931 --> 16:56.808
You're the topic of my life.

16:58.184 --> 17:07.527
If I... make films till I die,
they'll all be about you.

17:08.445 --> 17:14.325
All my films are
about you. You know?

17:15.910 --> 17:18.788
Why am I a topic?

17:24.294 --> 17:26.379
Why did we break up?

17:26.546 --> 17:30.300
Tell me. Why did
we break up then?

17:31.885 --> 17:36.222
- Later. I'll tell you later.
- Later? Again?

17:36.723 --> 17:38.475
Why?

17:39.809 --> 17:42.187
You know how hard it's been?

17:43.104 --> 17:47.108
What are you waiting for?

17:47.817 --> 17:50.111
It's hard for me, too.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.031
I'll tell you later
when the time comes.

17:54.824 --> 17:55.909
Sunhi.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.078
Look at me.

18:00.955 --> 18:04.250
I really like you.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.049
Do you know that?

18:16.179 --> 18:17.388
Do you?

18:22.018 --> 18:24.062
Why don't you know that?

18:26.106 --> 18:27.357
Why?

18:42.705 --> 18:45.542
I can't explain my feelings.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.383
- I'm weird, right?
- No.

18:55.051 --> 18:56.803
You're so pretty.

18:58.054 --> 19:05.228
In all my life... you're
the one I like the most.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.605
Really!

19:14.654 --> 19:15.905
I'd better go.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.870
Don't go.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.290
Sorry, I have to go.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.666
Where?

19:29.752 --> 19:33.047
I have to go somewhere.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.553
Don't leave like that!

20:35.568 --> 20:44.619
<i>Oh, the old days of playing
merrily in my hometown</i>

20:44.744 --> 20:53.503
<i>How we whispered love
under the tranquil moonlight</i>

20:53.878 --> 21:02.804
<i>Where have you gone?
Were you only a dream?</i>

21:02.929 --> 21:11.813
<i>In my old hometown,
only the grass has grown green</i>

21:35.003 --> 21:43.928
<i>In the beloved hometown,
you and I were innocent and young</i>

21:44.053 --> 21:52.812
<i>We held hands and promised
to never change</i>

21:53.354 --> 22:02.238
<i>Where have you gone leaving
me unforgettable memories?</i>

22:02.363 --> 22:10.872
<i>In the beloved hometown,
now only the moonlight shines on me</i>

22:38.483 --> 22:40.026
Jaehak!

22:42.487 --> 22:43.988
Jaehak!

22:59.879 --> 23:01.339
Jaehak!

23:45.174 --> 23:46.592
<i>Jaehak!</i>

23:59.480 --> 24:02.191
- What are You doing there?
- Hi!

24:03.151 --> 24:05.611
<i>I just came to see you.</i>

24:06.404 --> 24:07.822
<i>What are you doing?</i>

24:09.449 --> 24:10.867
just something.

24:12.952 --> 24:17.039
<i>I wanted to see you.
Should I come up?</i>

24:17.206 --> 24:20.543
But I was in the
middle of something.

24:21.252 --> 24:24.130
- You Have to do something?
- Yes.

24:24.255 --> 24:27.425
<i>What? Will it take long?</i>

24:28.759 --> 24:30.470
I'm not sure.

24:31.512 --> 24:33.639
You really came to see me?

24:33.764 --> 24:37.894
<i>Yes, I have something
to ask you.</i>

24:40.980 --> 24:43.649
<i>Can you come out
for a second?</i>

24:43.774 --> 24:46.235
You're noisy.
There are people.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.445
<i>What?</i>

24:49.071 --> 24:50.448
Then...

24:52.283 --> 24:58.206
Wait around. It'll take
me an hour or two.

24:59.081 --> 25:01.751
You know, 'Arirang'?
Yes.

25:02.126 --> 25:05.546
- Wait for me there?
- Okay, then.

25:06.756 --> 25:08.758
<i>I'll wait for you!</i>

25:29.946 --> 25:32.532
Annoying fool.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.971
Why's he bothering me! Damn!

26:09.151 --> 26:15.825
<i>CAFE ARIRANG</i>

26:22.498 --> 26:25.251
- Here. Have some.
- Thanks.

26:26.961 --> 26:29.338
What's taking him so long?

26:29.463 --> 26:32.216
- His phone's turned off, too.
- I don't know.

26:33.676 --> 26:37.305
Are you hungry? I know
a great chicken place.

26:37.430 --> 26:40.600
- Really?
- It's very good.

26:40.725 --> 26:44.895
Well, if you want,
you can order it.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.105
- Should I?
- Yes.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.107
- Then, I'll order.
- Sure.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.711
- Hi!
- Waited long?

27:08.878 --> 27:13.633
It's okay. I just wanted
to have a few drinks.

27:13.924 --> 27:17.470
You drank a lot.
Something wrong?

27:18.888 --> 27:20.056
Jaehak!

27:21.557 --> 27:25.561
I really, really missed you!

27:28.105 --> 27:32.234
You know I really
like you, right?

27:33.235 --> 27:34.654
Thanks.

27:36.072 --> 27:37.448
You really know?

27:39.158 --> 27:40.743
Sure you're okay?

27:42.244 --> 27:45.414
Things are hard these days.

27:45.873 --> 27:48.084
What's so hard?

27:50.878 --> 27:56.092
I just have a lot on
my mind these days.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.761
- You came?
- Hi.

27:58.886 --> 28:02.056
- What'll it be? Soju?
- just A cup.

28:02.473 --> 28:04.558
- We ordered chicken.
- Good idea.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.352
- Wasn't it?
- Yes.

28:07.269 --> 28:10.064
The chicken must
be really good.

28:10.147 --> 28:14.110
It's very fresh.
And very crispy.

28:14.443 --> 28:17.780
And it's less oily.

28:21.951 --> 28:26.789
Are you sick these days?
You don't look well.

28:27.873 --> 28:32.169
Well, sort of. But I
just don't feel right.

28:38.259 --> 28:40.094
I saw Sunhi.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.639
She came to me.

28:44.974 --> 28:47.852
So, I drank today.

28:47.977 --> 28:49.979
Oh, really?

28:50.646 --> 28:56.152
I heard she disappeared
and couldn't be reached.

28:56.318 --> 28:57.987
She came to see you?

29:01.782 --> 29:04.034
She came to the school.

29:05.244 --> 29:09.957
She's still as pretty as ever.

29:12.168 --> 29:13.753
Really?

29:14.003 --> 29:17.047
To me...

29:18.632 --> 29:25.347
she is really,
really pretty.

29:25.848 --> 29:28.976
I can't help it.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.062
Here you are.

29:33.522 --> 29:34.857
SOju?

29:44.450 --> 29:47.912
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.632
- Munsu.
- Yes?

30:02.384 --> 30:04.553
Women shouldn't
be held back.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.515
You think I held her back?

30:08.766 --> 30:12.645
No, I didn't.
I just liked her.

30:12.770 --> 30:16.565
Women are more
realistic than men.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.901
We should respect
their judgment.

30:20.110 --> 30:24.156
Men just fall for anyone.

30:24.448 --> 30:27.326
And too emotional.
But women are different.

30:27.451 --> 30:32.581
Women are far better than men.
Don't try to hold her back.

30:32.706 --> 30:35.334
If she wants to go,
then let her.

30:37.086 --> 30:39.964
That's good for
both of you.

30:43.050 --> 30:46.846
But Sunhi came to me.

30:49.265 --> 30:53.853
That means she is still
thinking about us.

30:53.978 --> 30:58.274
So, just go with
what she decides.

30:58.440 --> 31:03.571
Don't try so hard.
Don't ever overdo it.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.242
But I should try
hard to know!

31:08.742 --> 31:13.372
If I don't do anything, I won't
know what's really good!

31:16.292 --> 31:19.169
I guess.

31:20.004 --> 31:26.343
I have to dig all the way...

31:27.761 --> 31:31.807
I have to dig all the
way to get there.

31:31.974 --> 31:37.229
I have to dig all the way and go
to find out about myself.

31:37.313 --> 31:39.148
- Right?
- Look.

31:39.356 --> 31:44.111
Digging all the
way and going...

31:46.655 --> 31:51.660
- Digging and going...
- I get it.

31:51.785 --> 31:53.370
- No!
- Okay, I get it.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.748
- Listen to me!
- I get it!

31:55.873 --> 31:58.000
- Just listen to me!
- I get it!

31:58.125 --> 32:01.670
You have to dig all
the way to know.

32:01.795 --> 32:07.718
Then, I can go and
know what's important.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.095
I'll realize what's good.

32:10.179 --> 32:16.810
Fine. Digging all the way is good,
but you won't find what you want.

32:16.936 --> 32:23.108
You'll just learn what you can't do.
You'll know your limits.

32:23.651 --> 32:26.528
Then, you'll know
who you are.

32:28.322 --> 32:29.698
Really?

32:30.407 --> 32:35.204
There are a million things
you want. Right?

32:35.329 --> 32:37.539
And it changes every day?

32:39.959 --> 32:44.380
Anyone can imagine
what they can be.

32:48.050 --> 32:56.016
Knowing what You can't do...
that's how you know who you are.

32:57.434 --> 32:59.228
Do you really think that?

32:59.353 --> 33:01.897
Of course I do...

33:04.900 --> 33:10.072
Didn't I tell you this before?

33:12.616 --> 33:14.076
I thought I did.

33:15.744 --> 33:16.912
Didn't I?

33:19.665 --> 33:21.709
I told you this before.

33:23.585 --> 33:26.046
What are you talking about?

33:37.099 --> 33:39.309
Trying to put me down?

33:41.020 --> 33:44.440
No, I'm not. I'm just saying.

33:44.940 --> 33:48.694
Forget it, then.
Don't stare at me.

33:50.863 --> 33:56.952
Yes, don't stare like that.
Don't get angry.

33:57.077 --> 33:59.830
He's trying to give
you advice. Right?

33:59.955 --> 34:01.331
Right.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.127
Be happy drinking.

34:09.339 --> 34:11.759
Are you avoiding
me these days?

34:13.635 --> 34:14.845
No.

34:23.812 --> 34:28.984
Well, you never answer
my calls these days.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.864
And come out late like this.

34:37.743 --> 34:40.370
Before, you used to...

34:42.664 --> 34:43.665
call me often.

34:43.832 --> 34:47.961
But you never call me now!

34:49.421 --> 34:50.714
Why?

34:52.633 --> 34:53.759
I didn't?

34:56.678 --> 34:59.014
You could've felt that way.

35:03.102 --> 35:04.686
I'll tell you later.

35:10.484 --> 35:12.528
See? Even now!

35:17.074 --> 35:23.288
You're saying crazy things
to me, now! To me!

35:24.581 --> 35:29.878
I'll think it over.
Then, I'll tell you later.

35:36.093 --> 35:39.263
Tell me what!

35:39.388 --> 35:41.348
You're making me curious.

35:42.015 --> 35:44.268
It's something important.

35:45.310 --> 35:49.022
I'll think it over more,
then tell you.

35:49.565 --> 35:52.901
Man, I'm so curious.

35:53.527 --> 35:54.736
Really...

35:56.446 --> 36:00.784
What are you
thinking about me?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.494
Later!

36:09.001 --> 36:10.669
I'll tell you.

36:22.723 --> 36:25.767
- How about some music?
- Sure.

36:26.310 --> 36:28.562
I waited 3 hours.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.573
Hey-

37:28.247 --> 37:33.293
I heard this song.
just before.

37:34.753 --> 37:36.046
Okay, pal.

37:38.215 --> 37:41.176
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

38:04.533 --> 38:07.452
- Hello.
- Hi, Sunhi.

38:08.537 --> 38:10.455
- Sit down.
- Okay.

38:12.624 --> 38:16.837
- I printed 3 reference letters.
- Thank you.

38:17.671 --> 38:22.092
See if it's okay. If you
don't like it, don't use it.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.428
No, I'll use it. Thank you.

38:27.139 --> 38:29.641
- You even signed it?
- Of course.

38:30.225 --> 38:34.021
- You can read English, right?
- Yes.

38:36.606 --> 38:39.401
This is wine.

38:40.610 --> 38:46.074
You didn't have to.
I'll enjoy it.

38:53.749 --> 38:58.920
- I'll try my best.
- That's good. Good luck.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.268
One copy is mine.

39:31.578 --> 39:35.707
<i>Wui Sunhi was a film
student in my courses.</i>

39:35.832 --> 39:41.463
<i>She is reserved and rarely
expresses herself.</i>

39:41.588 --> 39:44.007
<i>So, she had difficulty
getting others</i>

39:44.132 --> 39:48.637
<i>to cooperate in her works.</i>

39:48.804 --> 39:53.683
<i>She seems ambitious, but
lacks courage to take action.</i>

39:53.809 --> 39:57.646
<i>She is smart and has
a great grasp on films.</i>

39:57.771 --> 39:59.272
<i>She has artistic sense.</i>

39:59.356 --> 40:02.984
<i>With chance,
she'll get stronger</i>

40:03.151 --> 40:06.780
<i>and may show
her hidden talents.</i>

40:06.905 --> 40:11.493
<i>I suspect she has some talent,
but I couldn't verify it.</i>

40:11.660 --> 40:17.707
<i>I hope her experience at your
school will be that chance.</i>

40:17.833 --> 40:22.754
<i>She tries to be honest and
has an ideally innocent side.</i>

40:22.879 --> 40:25.298
<i>Thank you for reading this.</i>

40:42.149 --> 40:43.358
<i>Hello?</i>

40:44.401 --> 40:47.612
It's Sunhi.
Are you okay to talk?

40:48.155 --> 40:50.282
<i>Sure. It's fine.</i>

40:51.116 --> 40:53.368
I read your reference letter.

40:54.035 --> 40:56.246
<i>Is it okay to write it like this?</i>

40:57.038 --> 41:01.626
<i>Why? What's wrong?
You don't like it?</i>

41:02.711 --> 41:11.261
It says things like
I'm reserved. Is that okay?

41:12.179 --> 41:17.559
<i>That's better, silly. It seems
more honest and good.</i>

41:17.684 --> 41:20.812
<i>They regard it more
highly like that abroad.</i>

41:20.937 --> 41:23.398
<i>I've written many references.</i>

41:25.108 --> 41:29.446
But it makes me seem
like a weak person.

41:29.571 --> 41:33.366
It doesn't say
what I want to do.

41:33.492 --> 41:36.328
<i>I wrote what I
felt about you.</i>

41:37.662 --> 41:39.748
<i>What do you
want me to do?</i>

41:41.625 --> 41:47.422
Can you spare me a moment?
Can we discuss this in person?

41:47.589 --> 41:50.008
I'd like to ask you
something, too.

41:51.593 --> 41:52.677
<i>Really?</i>

41:54.095 --> 41:57.474
<i>Fine, then.
Come to my room.</i>

41:59.100 --> 42:03.438
I'd like to treat
you to lunch.

42:03.605 --> 42:07.150
How about your
favorite place? 'The Sun'?

42:09.611 --> 42:13.114
<i>Okay, I'll be right there.</i>

42:13.240 --> 42:15.283
Thank you.

42:29.297 --> 42:33.426
<i>KOREAN CUISINE</i>

42:34.302 --> 42:35.720
Professor.

42:36.972 --> 42:39.266
Am I really that reserved?

42:39.391 --> 42:41.309
Yes, You are.

42:41.518 --> 42:44.980
But sometimes you
seem odd, and sometimes brave.

42:45.146 --> 42:49.234
- I'm brave?
- Yes, because You are honest.

42:49.359 --> 42:51.778
Then, why'd you say
I can't express myself?

42:51.903 --> 42:53.905
What? Did I?

42:55.991 --> 42:59.244
I told you I wrote
it in 30 minutes.

42:59.911 --> 43:04.583
You said, I lack courage,
but now you say I'm brave!

43:04.708 --> 43:07.669
You remember
everything I wrote?

43:10.839 --> 43:12.340
And...

43:13.758 --> 43:16.177
I seem too ambitious?

43:16.303 --> 43:18.471
You have hidden ambitions.

43:19.139 --> 43:20.807
Doesn't everybody?

43:20.932 --> 43:24.728
That's true, but
aren't you different?

43:25.687 --> 43:30.317
I'm not different!
I'm just the same.

43:31.359 --> 43:35.280
Right. But I said
some good things.

43:35.405 --> 43:36.781
I guess.

43:38.700 --> 43:40.619
You said, I was good.

43:41.453 --> 43:43.371
I have artistic sense.

43:43.955 --> 43:45.206
And I'm idealistic.

43:45.373 --> 43:49.586
You do have artistic
sense and you're good.

43:51.671 --> 43:53.340
I'm not good.

43:54.174 --> 43:55.091
Really?

43:59.054 --> 44:01.931
You want me to give
it more thought, right?

44:02.057 --> 44:05.268
Yes. just 30 minutes
more, please?

44:05.393 --> 44:07.896
Fine. I'll think 1 more hour.

44:08.021 --> 44:14.194
But will that bring
out anything else?

44:15.570 --> 44:17.072
I don't know.

44:18.740 --> 44:20.784
Right. You don't.

44:25.497 --> 44:27.874
You used to like me.

44:28.416 --> 44:32.337
So, I came to you.
But why're you so cold?

44:33.171 --> 44:37.258
Right. You're my
favorite student.

44:38.218 --> 44:41.471
- That's right.
- But you were cold.

44:44.432 --> 44:48.645
Though I liked you,
you never called me.

44:49.729 --> 44:51.606
You never call, do you?

44:53.233 --> 44:57.487
Remember when
you held my hand?

44:57.612 --> 44:58.822
No.

45:00.657 --> 45:05.745
In the winter, we met
outside the library.

45:06.079 --> 45:10.959
You pretended to give me a High 5,
then grabbed my hand.

45:11.084 --> 45:12.794
You don't remember?

45:13.795 --> 45:16.715
You squeezed it
hard like this.

45:17.173 --> 45:25.390
- Don't you remember?
- Oh, right. I did.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.478
Because I liked you.

45:33.732 --> 45:35.608
Did you do that
to the other girls?

45:36.234 --> 45:39.320
No. just you.

45:40.280 --> 45:41.531
Why?

45:47.412 --> 45:49.497
Because I wanted
to be with you.

45:54.878 --> 45:56.337
Really?

45:59.758 --> 46:05.722
Because I wanted to be
on your side forever.

46:10.226 --> 46:12.061
What a comment.

46:16.858 --> 46:19.152
Want me to be on
your side for life?

46:21.112 --> 46:22.697
Should I?

46:24.532 --> 46:25.617
Yes.

46:27.202 --> 46:28.453
I'd like that.

46:31.372 --> 46:32.957
Thanks.

46:36.336 --> 46:40.423
I'm the thankful one.
Have a drink.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.651
When do you need
the reference letter?

46:59.776 --> 47:02.362
The sooner the better.

47:03.988 --> 47:05.615
Thank you.

48:01.379 --> 48:02.755
Jaehak!

48:05.174 --> 48:06.509
Jaehak!

48:14.642 --> 48:16.144
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

48:16.269 --> 48:20.023
just passing by.
Are you busy?

48:20.648 --> 48:21.524
<i>Not really.</i>

48:21.649 --> 48:25.987
Really? Then,
should I come up?

48:26.112 --> 48:27.780
No.

48:30.867 --> 48:35.163
<i>Wait for me at Cafe Gondry
down the street?</i>

48:35.330 --> 48:39.083
- Café Gondry?
- Yes.

48:39.208 --> 48:41.502
Okay, then.

49:06.486 --> 49:08.154
Why didn't you
call beforehand?

49:10.865 --> 49:14.369
Aren't you moving back in?
How long will you live there?

49:14.494 --> 49:19.874
I don't know. They raised the rent,
so I might move to West Village.

49:19.999 --> 49:21.542
- West Village?
- Yes.

49:21.709 --> 49:24.671
That place was really nice.

49:24.796 --> 49:27.632
Isn't the sunrise
beautiful from up there?

49:27.757 --> 49:33.054
Yes, but they want $200 more
from when you lived there.

49:36.599 --> 49:41.354
Why aren't you going home?
Doesn't your wife say anything?

49:43.982 --> 49:48.361
I feel bad, but...
I went there last month.

49:48.486 --> 49:49.988
You did?

49:55.910 --> 49:59.539
I'm sorry to keep asking.
But Why'd you leave home?

49:59.664 --> 50:02.625
Let's not talk about that.

50:02.750 --> 50:07.922
I'm curious. Why'd you leave
your lovely wife to live out alone?

50:08.047 --> 50:13.845
Let's just drop it. That's
my business to handle.

50:14.262 --> 50:17.682
Your wife is amazing.

50:19.350 --> 50:20.935
I feel sorry...

50:22.437 --> 50:24.605
But I can't help it.

50:26.649 --> 50:29.861
Still, sometimes I envy you.

50:31.362 --> 50:32.822
You?

50:33.656 --> 50:37.744
- Why would You envy me?
- You live so freely.

50:37.910 --> 50:41.122
I like how you live true
to your feelings.

50:44.250 --> 50:46.627
It's weird to hear you
say that to me.

50:46.753 --> 50:49.380
I'd love to live like you.

50:50.465 --> 50:53.134
Really? You think that?

50:53.301 --> 50:56.387
Of course! I'm a man, too.

50:56.512 --> 50:58.973
I'd love to live freely.

50:59.974 --> 51:02.685
I see.

51:02.810 --> 51:04.812
There's a famous quote...

51:04.979 --> 51:10.234
'Sooner strangle
an infant in its cradle

51:10.359 --> 51:12.653
than nurse unacted love'.

51:13.988 --> 51:22.038
I think it's great how you
live true to your emotions.

51:23.539 --> 51:25.291
You're great.

51:31.005 --> 51:33.841
What's with you today?

51:35.551 --> 51:38.137
I've never heard you
say things like that.

51:40.306 --> 51:41.516
Hey-

51:43.434 --> 51:45.269
Did something happen?

51:49.065 --> 51:50.274
Yes.

51:52.527 --> 51:59.325
I met up with a girl again.
I can't take my mind off her.

51:59.659 --> 52:02.370
Really? Who?

52:04.831 --> 52:06.415
Wow!

52:08.709 --> 52:11.921
This is really amusing.

52:12.713 --> 52:15.216
I don't want to say who it is.

52:16.050 --> 52:18.427
Who is she?

52:20.012 --> 52:22.390
Ordinary and a bit young.

52:22.557 --> 52:25.518
- How young?
- She's just A lot younger.

52:25.643 --> 52:29.730
This is so shocking!

52:29.856 --> 52:33.609
I can't believe I'm
hearing this from you!

52:33.734 --> 52:36.737
You like seeing me like this?

52:36.863 --> 52:38.906
It's amusing!

52:39.073 --> 52:43.286
It's great.
If you like her, it's great.

52:43.870 --> 52:46.581
I'm not dating her yet.

52:47.456 --> 52:53.045
She's just a young
woman I cherish.

52:54.172 --> 52:57.008
- Something like that.
- Really?

52:57.800 --> 53:05.391
Even now, she makes
my heart throb.

53:05.516 --> 53:10.271
As I thought of her this morning,
my heart started pounding.

53:10.438 --> 53:14.358
But I loved that feeling.

53:18.654 --> 53:23.159
I almost forgot how that felt.
It's been so long.

53:23.951 --> 53:26.454
It's a good thing.

53:26.621 --> 53:30.583
- Is it?
- Of course it is.

53:31.334 --> 53:33.753
Tell me more about her.

53:35.004 --> 53:41.594
She's good. She's reserved,
has artistic sense, and is smart.

53:41.719 --> 53:46.474
Sometimes she seems odd.
But she's great.

53:49.435 --> 53:51.020
Great.

53:53.481 --> 53:56.859
- You like someone like that?
- Yes.

53:56.984 --> 53:59.153
I've met a lot of people.

53:59.278 --> 54:02.740
I'm sick of girls who act
innocent and quiet.

54:02.865 --> 54:06.160
But she's brave.

54:07.995 --> 54:10.039
Do you want to get a beer?

54:10.414 --> 54:14.418
I do, but I have to meet
some professors.

54:15.920 --> 54:19.966
I'd love to drink.
Let's have some next time.

54:20.091 --> 54:23.678
Okay. But I need
a beer now.

54:28.849 --> 54:30.351
<i>Hello?</i>

54:33.229 --> 54:34.730
<i>Hello?</i>

54:49.370 --> 54:51.998
<i>Director!</i>

54:54.375 --> 54:58.254
- Sir!
- Sunhi!

55:03.509 --> 55:05.386
What are you doing there?

55:12.018 --> 55:15.896
- Hello.
- It's been A long time.

55:16.022 --> 55:17.982
Yes, it has.

55:18.107 --> 55:22.486
I stopped for some
good coffee here.

55:22.611 --> 55:24.030
But here you are.

55:24.155 --> 55:27.742
- Well, I live Here.
- Right.

55:28.826 --> 55:32.163
- You've lost weight.
- No, I'm the same.

55:33.331 --> 55:37.251
- You look skinnier.
- I'm the same, too.

55:38.127 --> 55:40.004
- Drinking coffee?
- Yes.

55:40.129 --> 55:42.006
I'll order one, too.

55:44.842 --> 55:46.719
Did you eat?

55:46.844 --> 55:51.098
Yes, I ate. Will You
buy me drinks?

55:51.432 --> 55:58.147
Really? Then, let's go now.
We don't need coffee.

55:58.272 --> 55:59.440
Okay.

56:05.112 --> 56:07.031
You lost so much weight.

56:07.907 --> 56:10.618
- Did You pay for the coffee?
- Yes.

56:14.622 --> 56:20.586
<i>CAFE ARIRANG</i>

56:20.753 --> 56:22.129
Cheers.

56:34.642 --> 56:38.396
Do you like chicken?
I know a good chicken place.

56:38.521 --> 56:41.357
- Want to try it?
- Sure. Thank you.

56:41.482 --> 56:47.321
Sunhi, you're so pretty.
You have a beautiful face.

56:50.324 --> 56:52.201
You look great, too.

56:52.326 --> 56:53.994
- Really?
- Yes.

56:54.662 --> 56:56.664
- I'll order the chicken.
- Okay.

57:00.876 --> 57:05.756
- We're ordering chicken.
- Great! Order it.

57:06.090 --> 57:08.926
- Then, I'll go order.
- Order it.

57:11.929 --> 57:14.974
She loves anything
with chicken in it.

57:15.099 --> 57:16.851
Really?

57:17.017 --> 57:21.230
When I met Munsu here
before, we had chicken, too.

57:22.898 --> 57:27.611
- You met Munsu?
- Yes, he said he met you.

57:27.820 --> 57:32.324
Really? We met by chance.

57:33.033 --> 57:37.580
Really? He said
you came to him.

57:37.705 --> 57:44.712
Crazy fool. That's nonsense.
We met by chance.

57:46.130 --> 57:47.631
Okay, then.

57:48.799 --> 57:54.597
Anyway, it looks like he
is still in love with you.

57:54.722 --> 58:00.186
He said his feelings for you
didn't change at all.

58:01.061 --> 58:04.732
Well, so what?

58:06.817 --> 58:13.574
He's a good guy.
He's manly. And nice.

58:17.328 --> 58:20.080
I'm not going to
date men anymore.

58:21.916 --> 58:24.960
- Really?
- Yes.

58:26.712 --> 58:31.467
I just want to study.
Or else...

58:32.593 --> 58:39.975
I'll give up everything and
just move to the country.

58:40.100 --> 58:42.478
- To your mother?
- Yes.

58:42.603 --> 58:45.439
Then, what?

58:48.442 --> 58:50.736
I just want to be alone.

58:52.571 --> 58:55.282
Should I try farming?

58:56.951 --> 58:59.203
You? Farming?

59:01.956 --> 59:04.917
That's funny.

59:10.798 --> 59:13.801
You can't farm.

59:14.677 --> 59:18.931
Then, what?
What should I do?

59:20.057 --> 59:25.521
Look. I think
they're all excuses.

59:26.397 --> 59:31.986
Studying? That's
all an excuse.

59:33.487 --> 59:35.573
- Really?
- Yes.

59:35.698 --> 59:39.368
- An excuse?
- That's what I think.

59:39.577 --> 59:45.583
Just do what you like doing.

59:46.709 --> 59:51.589
You want to make
films, right?

59:54.258 --> 59:57.136
So, you wrote
scripts and such.

59:57.845 --> 1:00:01.599
Then, just keep doing
what you like to do.

1:00:01.724 --> 1:00:03.517
Dig deep while you can.

1:00:03.642 --> 1:00:06.687
Before you get older.
When you have strength.

1:00:06.854 --> 1:00:10.357
Keep at it all the way.
To the end.

1:00:10.733 --> 1:00:14.737
Dig all the way
to see your limits.

1:00:15.237 --> 1:00:19.617
Then, it's comforting.

1:00:20.159 --> 1:00:23.954
And you'll find out who
you are. That's the best.

1:00:26.707 --> 1:00:28.751
I've heard that before.

1:00:30.336 --> 1:00:31.712
You have?

1:00:33.505 --> 1:00:38.844
Yes, I have. But I have no
luck when I really need it.

1:00:40.012 --> 1:00:42.931
You really know
what I'm saying?

1:00:43.057 --> 1:00:45.059
I know.

1:00:46.060 --> 1:00:49.938
I used to take in
every word you said.

1:00:50.064 --> 1:00:55.527
Now, it goes in one ear
and out the other.

1:00:58.072 --> 1:01:02.576
It's no use at all.

1:01:03.535 --> 1:01:06.163
People need luck.

1:01:08.123 --> 1:01:11.001
- Luck is the best.
- Right.

1:01:11.377 --> 1:01:13.087
But you're wrong.

1:01:14.922 --> 1:01:16.757
Don't say things like that.

1:01:19.551 --> 1:01:23.597
Why're you so cold to me?

1:01:24.890 --> 1:01:26.850
Because I met Munsu?

1:01:32.940 --> 1:01:36.068
Why would I be?

1:01:37.069 --> 1:01:39.279
You like me seeing Munsu?

1:01:43.784 --> 1:01:45.119
No.

1:01:49.832 --> 1:01:53.627
I'd rather you don't
meet him. But...

1:01:56.964 --> 1:02:00.884
I have no right to
say that. Right?

1:02:04.012 --> 1:02:08.851
I don't have to date men.

1:02:10.269 --> 1:02:12.813
I don't need them.

1:02:14.690 --> 1:02:16.900
The only thing
that's important...

1:02:16.984 --> 1:02:21.655
What's really important
is knowing who I am.

1:02:41.842 --> 1:02:43.385
You're good.

1:02:45.429 --> 1:02:47.973
You're a little reserved.

1:02:50.517 --> 1:02:52.186
But you're smart.

1:02:54.521 --> 1:02:57.441
You have great artistic sense.

1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:01.904
You're a little odd.

1:03:04.740 --> 1:03:09.244
But that also means
you're brave. Right?

1:03:10.579 --> 1:03:12.372
I'm brave?

1:03:13.624 --> 1:03:14.917
Yes.

1:03:18.712 --> 1:03:23.383
And you're the prettiest
girl I've ever met.

1:03:23.592 --> 1:03:25.385
Really?

1:03:26.386 --> 1:03:27.721
Yes.

1:03:30.891 --> 1:03:33.936
Believe me.

1:03:34.812 --> 1:03:37.231
I want to believe.

1:03:41.568 --> 1:03:43.195
You're lovely.

1:03:49.535 --> 1:03:51.912
It's good to see you again.

1:03:54.790 --> 1:03:56.750
Me, too.

1:04:01.213 --> 1:04:06.385
You scare me.
Sometimes you really do.

1:04:14.893 --> 1:04:20.274
Though it gets hard...

1:04:25.279 --> 1:04:30.784
just don't do anything
to stand in shame.

1:04:40.127 --> 1:04:42.087
You're so lovely.

1:04:44.923 --> 1:04:47.384
Sometimes you're very lovely.

1:04:54.141 --> 1:04:55.475
Lovely.

1:04:57.311 --> 1:04:59.271
I feel the same.

1:05:30.260 --> 1:05:31.845
So lovely.

1:05:39.353 --> 1:05:48.362
<i>Oh, the old days of playing
merrily in my hometown</i>

1:05:48.528 --> 1:05:56.745
<i>How we whispered love
under the tranquil moonlight</i>

1:05:57.621 --> 1:06:06.630
<i>Where have you gone?
Were you only a dream?</i>

1:06:06.755 --> 1:06:15.430
<i>In my old hometown,
only the grass has grown green</i>

1:06:40.914 --> 1:06:42.749
Chicken delivery.

1:06:54.511 --> 1:06:57.180
Hello. Here you are.

1:07:00.308 --> 1:07:02.728
- Thank you. Bye.
- Enjoy.

1:07:02.853 --> 1:07:05.439
Thanks. The chicken is here!

1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:21.788
Have some.
It looks so good.

1:07:24.666 --> 1:07:27.127
It looks delicious!

1:07:58.533 --> 1:08:00.077
You want to do it?

1:08:02.746 --> 1:08:03.830
Yes.

1:08:47.791 --> 1:08:49.876
I'm not really drunk.

1:08:51.503 --> 1:08:52.963
Go in.

1:08:54.714 --> 1:08:55.966
You sure?

1:09:01.721 --> 1:09:04.015
I'll see you go, then leave.

1:09:04.141 --> 1:09:08.895
- No, I'll see you off.
- No.

1:09:09.729 --> 1:09:11.481
You go in.

1:09:14.609 --> 1:09:19.072
Then, take this with you.

1:09:23.410 --> 1:09:26.413
I'm going in.

1:09:33.587 --> 1:09:35.881
We still have lots of time.

1:09:37.799 --> 1:09:39.050
Right.

1:10:27.807 --> 1:10:36.983
<i>CHANGGYEONG PALACE</i>

1:10:38.026 --> 1:10:40.946
<i>Wui Sunhi's works
in my workshops...</i>

1:10:41.029 --> 1:10:46.201
<i>were strong, experimental pieces
far from existing narratives.</i>

1:10:46.326 --> 1:10:50.997
<i>They were beautiful pieces
that overcame...</i>

1:10:51.122 --> 1:10:54.668
<i>The typical trap of</i>

1:10:54.834 --> 1:10:57.128
<i>self-absorbed expressions.</i>

1:10:57.254 --> 1:11:00.924
<i>Free from the constraints
of certainty...</i>

1:11:01.049 --> 1:11:06.054
<i>there were poetic messages
effectively expressed within.</i>

1:11:06.221 --> 1:11:10.976
<i>Seeing her amazing achievements
at a young age...</i>

1:11:11.101 --> 1:11:16.356
<i>she made me realize the joy
of teaching as her professor.</i>

1:11:16.523 --> 1:11:19.693
<i>She has a calm personality
and a meticulous mind.</i>

1:11:19.818 --> 1:11:24.072
<i>She is persistent yet not
fallen to self-assertion.</i>

1:11:24.197 --> 1:11:27.993
<i>Although a quiet way
of communicating...</i>

1:11:28.118 --> 1:11:33.206
<i>I've witnessed her success
in sharing opinions.</i>

1:11:33.331 --> 1:11:37.419
<i>She has innocence and
honesty of the ideal person.</i>

1:11:37.544 --> 1:11:42.507
<i>It's hard to imagine
a person of</i>

1:11:42.632 --> 1:11:47.387
<i>such integrity and
talents will fail.</i>

1:11:47.554 --> 1:11:49.806
<i>I hope the school's
excellent programs</i>

1:11:49.931 --> 1:11:53.685
<i>will have great effects on her.</i>

1:11:59.941 --> 1:12:02.610
- Hi.
- Busy?

1:12:03.486 --> 1:12:05.405
I'm just at a palace.

1:12:06.489 --> 1:12:09.784
- Which one?
- No need to know.

1:12:11.703 --> 1:12:16.082
- Are you with someone?
- Yes, someone.

1:12:17.292 --> 1:12:18.752
<i>Are you at Changgyeong Palace?</i>

1:12:20.587 --> 1:12:22.464
How did you know?

1:12:22.589 --> 1:12:26.468
<i>Well, I just thought
you'd go there.</i>

1:12:27.719 --> 1:12:29.346
Really? Why?

1:12:30.305 --> 1:12:32.432
<i>You don't like crowded places.</i>

1:12:34.017 --> 1:12:35.310
You're good.

1:12:36.269 --> 1:12:38.271
<i>Can we meet?</i>

1:12:38.646 --> 1:12:40.607
Sorry, I'm busy.

1:12:40.732 --> 1:12:43.234
<i>There's something
I have to tell you.</i>

1:12:43.735 --> 1:12:45.236
Tell me now.

1:12:46.112 --> 1:12:48.531
<i>Let's have drinks.
I'll tell you then.</i>

1:12:49.449 --> 1:12:51.785
I already drank too much.

1:12:52.243 --> 1:12:53.787
<i>Really?</i>

1:12:54.746 --> 1:12:59.250
- It's because of you.
- Me? Why?

1:12:59.876 --> 1:13:02.504
Anyway, I'm not
drinking anymore.

1:13:02.962 --> 1:13:04.798
<i>Let's just meet up.</i>

1:13:07.050 --> 1:13:10.637
I'll call you in the
evening if I can.

1:13:12.639 --> 1:13:14.808
Let's come to our senses.

1:13:15.475 --> 1:13:19.229
- Will you help me?
- Of course.

1:13:20.146 --> 1:13:22.023
Let's really do it.

1:13:22.565 --> 1:13:26.069
<i>I just need to see you.
I don't need anything else.</i>

1:13:26.403 --> 1:13:32.492
- Okay. I'd better go.
- Sunhi! I really want to see you.

1:13:33.284 --> 1:13:36.704
- Okay. I'm hanging up.
- Call me.

1:13:56.307 --> 1:13:59.727
- Jaehak?
- How've you been?

1:13:59.853 --> 1:14:03.731
Good. Why did you call?

1:14:04.232 --> 1:14:05.859
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1:14:06.776 --> 1:14:09.779
Enjoying a taste of autumn.

1:14:10.530 --> 1:14:14.826
- Really? Where are you?
- Changgyeong Palace.

1:14:15.201 --> 1:14:19.038
Really? What brings you
to a place like that?

1:14:20.081 --> 1:14:24.085
I wanted to feel autumn's breeze
before the seasons change.

1:14:24.711 --> 1:14:29.215
- Is it nice there?
- Yes. it's quiet and nice.

1:14:29.424 --> 1:14:31.050
Really?

1:14:32.093 --> 1:14:33.928
<i>Should I go, too?</i>

1:14:34.721 --> 1:14:41.686
Ah, no. I'm with
someone right now.

1:14:42.312 --> 1:14:44.105
<i>Really? Who?</i>

1:14:45.023 --> 1:14:48.693
I'd rather not say.

1:14:49.319 --> 1:14:53.448
<i>You really are with someone?</i>

1:14:53.990 --> 1:14:56.326
- Is it the girl?
- What?

1:14:58.870 --> 1:15:00.121
No need to know.

1:15:00.246 --> 1:15:04.167
<i>You're really up to
trouble, aren't you?</i>

1:15:04.292 --> 1:15:07.837
I'm not up to any trouble.
What are You up to?

1:15:07.962 --> 1:15:14.594
<i>Nothing. We promised to have
drinks. I feel like drinking today.</i>

1:15:15.762 --> 1:15:21.476
Really? So early in the day?
Did something bad happen?

1:15:22.769 --> 1:15:27.273
Just a little down today.
Let's have drinks.

1:15:27.398 --> 1:15:32.570
I'm sorry. I can't
today. I'm sorry.

1:15:33.404 --> 1:15:37.784
<i>You really are up to
trouble! Lucky you!</i>

1:15:37.909 --> 1:15:44.332
- I'm not up to trouble.
- Must be nice.

1:15:45.500 --> 1:15:50.296
<i>Okay, then. Have fun.
I'd better go drink.</i>

1:15:50.421 --> 1:15:56.636
Have a drink. I'll call
you later if I can.

1:15:57.262 --> 1:16:01.683
- Okay. Call me.
- Okay.

1:16:14.279 --> 1:16:17.657
- I feel like drinking.
- Really?

1:16:17.782 --> 1:16:19.325
How about a drink?

1:16:19.492 --> 1:16:23.454
- I need to pass.
- Really? Not feeling well?

1:16:23.580 --> 1:16:26.833
- I over drank.
- Okay, then.

1:16:27.875 --> 1:16:32.547
I read the reference letter.
You wrote about me so well.

1:16:32.672 --> 1:16:36.759
You complimented me so
much, I'm embarrassed.

1:16:36.884 --> 1:16:38.970
Don't use it if you
don't want to.

1:16:39.596 --> 1:16:41.973
I'm sorry you wrote it twice.

1:16:42.098 --> 1:16:45.560
No need. I wrote
that in 30 minutes.

1:16:45.685 --> 1:16:49.939
I could express you
better by rewriting it.

1:16:50.398 --> 1:16:52.984
I rushed the first one.

1:16:53.109 --> 1:16:58.114
So, is this similar
to who I really am?

1:16:58.239 --> 1:17:00.575
This is the real you.

1:17:00.700 --> 1:17:04.203
The more you think,
the more you see.

1:17:04.370 --> 1:17:06.039
Right.

1:17:06.873 --> 1:17:09.375
I wish I can be
like this forever.

1:17:10.376 --> 1:17:13.004
Like what you wrote here.

1:17:13.963 --> 1:17:15.548
This is you.

1:17:16.382 --> 1:17:17.967
Okay.

1:17:19.177 --> 1:17:24.140
I'll believe you, take
courage, and study hard.

1:17:24.265 --> 1:17:26.434
Good. Do your best.

1:17:27.769 --> 1:17:31.230
If I get to go abroad,
I'm going to dig deep.

1:17:31.397 --> 1:17:34.859
Great. Dig deep till
you see the end.

1:17:34.984 --> 1:17:36.235
I will.

1:17:36.402 --> 1:17:40.156
If I dig deeper,
I'll find out who I am.

1:17:40.281 --> 1:17:44.911
Then, I'll feel better no
matter what I find out.

1:17:45.787 --> 1:17:50.458
Good. I told you
before to dig deep.

1:17:51.209 --> 1:17:52.168
Did you?

1:17:52.293 --> 1:17:55.963
Of course, I did.
I said to dig deep.

1:17:57.548 --> 1:18:04.514
- Well, maybe you did.
- Silly. I said that to you.

1:18:04.639 --> 1:18:06.307
Right. You did.

1:18:10.269 --> 1:18:13.940
I know you'll do well.
I believe it.

1:18:14.065 --> 1:18:17.235
- I want to believe it.
- Good.

1:18:32.792 --> 1:18:35.962
Wow! Do it again.

1:18:42.093 --> 1:18:44.971
It bounced back.

1:18:45.388 --> 1:18:47.140
Let me try.

1:18:56.441 --> 1:18:58.401
- This isn't easy.
- Let me try again.

1:18:58.526 --> 1:19:00.486
No, I'll try again.

1:19:04.991 --> 1:19:08.494
You try. How can
you throw so well?

1:19:11.873 --> 1:19:13.249
One more time.

1:19:38.775 --> 1:19:42.653
- I need to use the restroom.
- Really? It's over there.

1:19:42.779 --> 1:19:44.572
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

1:20:00.505 --> 1:20:01.714
<i>Hi.</i>

1:20:05.593 --> 1:20:06.803
What?

1:20:08.221 --> 1:20:09.680
Why'd you come here?

1:20:09.806 --> 1:20:14.060
I came because
you said it's nice.

1:20:14.227 --> 1:20:16.562
I haven't been
here in a while.

1:20:16.729 --> 1:20:19.941
Why didn't you call
before you come?

1:20:20.066 --> 1:20:22.151
Are you alone? Why?

1:20:23.903 --> 1:20:28.783
You silly fool. You should've
called me before.

1:20:28.908 --> 1:20:34.705
I came for sightseeing. I'll go.

1:20:34.831 --> 1:20:40.294
- What are You so scared of?
- Why would I be scared?

1:20:41.045 --> 1:20:42.421
Jaehak!

1:20:42.630 --> 1:20:44.298
- Professor?
- Hi.

1:20:44.423 --> 1:20:47.218
- Hi, Munsu.
- What brings You here?

1:20:47.343 --> 1:20:50.429
What are you
two doing here?

1:20:50.596 --> 1:20:52.682
Why'd you come here?

1:20:52.807 --> 1:20:55.852
I just came to see Sunhi.

1:20:56.894 --> 1:21:00.857
- Sunhi?
- Yes. Sunhi said she's here.

1:21:01.190 --> 1:21:03.734
Sunhi's here? Really?

1:21:05.027 --> 1:21:10.449
- You came to see Sunhi?
- Yes. Did you see her by chance?

1:21:11.284 --> 1:21:13.119
We didn't see her.

1:21:15.788 --> 1:21:18.791
What are you doing
here, Professor?

1:21:18.916 --> 1:21:24.463
- You came for the autumn leaves?
- Yes. it seems so.

1:21:25.006 --> 1:21:29.135
It's really nice here. I haven't
been here in a while.

1:21:29.635 --> 1:21:32.430
- It's nice.
- Yes, it's really nice.

1:21:32.930 --> 1:21:35.600
I'm going to the bathroom.
You two stay here.

1:21:35.725 --> 1:21:38.394
- I need to go, too.
- I was going to go, too.

1:21:38.519 --> 1:21:39.979
- Let's go together.
- Okay.

1:21:41.230 --> 1:21:44.358
- Professor? Let's go.
- Sure.

1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:43.250
<i>Jaehak and Munsu came.</i>

1:22:43.376 --> 1:22:46.796
<i>You go ahead first.
I'll call you later.</i>

1:23:02.061 --> 1:23:04.230
- Let's go This way.
- Okay.

1:23:39.223 --> 1:23:40.933
I don't see Sunhi around.

1:23:43.436 --> 1:23:47.064
- Have you dated Sunhi long?
- Yes.

1:23:48.524 --> 1:23:51.485
But she's making
things hard.

1:23:52.028 --> 1:23:53.195
Why?

1:23:54.989 --> 1:23:59.493
She is kind of reserved,
so she doesn't open up.

1:24:00.453 --> 1:24:04.832
We've been together long, but
I don't know how she feels.

1:24:05.541 --> 1:24:08.753
- I see.
- Yes.

1:24:08.836 --> 1:24:11.672
Why date her
when it's so hard?

1:24:12.840 --> 1:24:15.634
But she's also really smart.

1:24:16.052 --> 1:24:18.429
I know. She is smart.

1:24:18.554 --> 1:24:21.140
She's smart and
has artistic sense.

1:24:22.266 --> 1:24:27.354
- You know, too?
- I know her. She's my junior.

1:24:28.647 --> 1:24:34.195
Right. She's cute
and a little odd.

1:24:34.653 --> 1:24:37.239
She's honest
and really brave.

1:24:38.657 --> 1:24:41.702
Right. I think so, too.

1:24:43.579 --> 1:24:46.290
I guess people see
things the same.

1:24:46.874 --> 1:24:48.250
Right.

1:24:50.669 --> 1:24:54.215
But I don't know
what she is thinking.

1:24:54.799 --> 1:24:55.966
Really?

1:24:57.927 --> 1:25:00.137
Where'd she go?

1:25:00.429 --> 1:25:02.098
Try calling her.

1:25:02.223 --> 1:25:05.309
I just did, but
her phone is off.

1:25:06.727 --> 1:25:08.938
I hope she won't hide again.

1:25:09.021 --> 1:25:11.732
- She just got back.
- Really?

1:25:11.857 --> 1:25:15.528
She tends to disappear.

1:25:16.529 --> 1:25:19.406
Sometimes she can't
be reached for years.

1:25:19.532 --> 1:25:23.119
- She can't do it again.
- I see.

1:25:23.869 --> 1:25:26.539
People live the
way they please.

1:25:26.664 --> 1:25:31.293
Right. There's nothing
much others can do.

1:25:31.418 --> 1:25:32.545
Right.
