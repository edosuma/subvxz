00:59.025 --> 01:00.626
My name is Michelle McNally

01:00.994 --> 01:04.396
The older child of an Anglo lndian
family based in Shimla

01:07.467 --> 01:10.636
This story is about me
and my teacher

01:11.371 --> 01:14.506
A story about two people
left incomplete by god...

01:15.275 --> 01:17.543
who have fought a battle
with fate...

01:17.677 --> 01:20.045
and made the impossible,
possible

01:20.914 --> 01:23.582
The world in my story
is different...

01:24.751 --> 01:28.120
where sound transcends
into silence...

01:30.924 --> 01:34.059
and light into darkness

01:35.995 --> 01:37.763
This is my world

01:37.764 --> 01:42.134
Where nothing can be
seen nor heard

01:43.002 --> 01:48.907
There is only one name
for my world...

02:00.086 --> 02:02.788
How long can you
live in this darkness?

02:03.156 --> 02:07.726
A few moments...
hours... days?

02:08.695 --> 02:12.498
For 40 years I've lived
in this darkness...

02:12.665 --> 02:16.468
for 4 years I've given
my final B.A. exam...

02:17.237 --> 02:20.439
and for twelve years, I've gone
to this church, every Sunday

02:21.941 --> 02:23.976
But that Sunday was special

02:24.110 --> 02:28.147
I felt God
would answer my prayers...

03:06.252 --> 03:09.421
my only prayer was...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

03:09.522 --> 03:13.392
that my teacher
would come back to me

03:16.296 --> 03:21.767
My prayers take long
to reach God...

03:22.535 --> 03:25.837
and he takes long
in granting them

03:27.440 --> 03:29.808
Even that Sunday I didn't
find my teacher

03:30.677 --> 03:33.145
That evening Sara
and I were returning home...

03:33.279 --> 03:34.479
when suddenly...

03:48.394 --> 03:49.461
Wait...

03:53.233 --> 03:55.500
Michelle, just wait for me, ok?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.200
Oh my God!

04:29.502 --> 04:33.538
MlCHELLE!
MlCHELLE! MlCHELLE!

04:36.376 --> 04:39.911
MlCHELLE!
Your prayers have been answered...

04:40.780 --> 04:43.215
it's Debraj... he's there
near the fountain.

04:45.151 --> 04:51.590
It's true, I promise, yes promise!
Come! Yes. Yes

05:16.783 --> 05:19.551
That day my teacher
came back to me...

05:20.119 --> 05:23.088
after 1 2 years I recognized him...

05:23.222 --> 05:27.693
but he had forgotten everything...

05:28.861 --> 05:33.165
even me

05:33.766 --> 05:37.336
I am writing this story for him...

05:37.503 --> 05:40.405
to my teacher - Debraj Sahai

06:06.866 --> 06:09.935
He doesn't remember anything?

06:10.069 --> 06:11.770
Surely there must be something
we can do.

06:12.271 --> 06:16.942
Sara, Mr.Sahai
has Alzheimer's disease.

06:17.076 --> 06:20.579
He has forgotten everything.
It's a very scary void.

06:20.713 --> 06:24.316
Mr. Sahai has
even forgotten his bed.

06:24.484 --> 06:31.823
He has forgotten words,
even forgotten how to speak.

06:31.991 --> 06:35.260
No doctor.
I refuse to believe this...

06:35.428 --> 06:37.562
he must remember something...

06:37.697 --> 06:41.833
otherwise, after all these years,
to find him at our house...

06:43.770 --> 06:47.172
and Mr. Sahai can
never forget Michelle.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.243
Like a duster wipes the words
of a blackboard...

06:51.878 --> 06:56.648
the disease has slowly
wiped out all his memories.

06:57.216 --> 07:02.421
A few words or instances
might spark some memory...

07:03.189 --> 07:05.023
but Alzheimer's has no cure.

07:06.526 --> 07:07.959
What is Michelle doing?

07:09.228 --> 07:13.365
She wants to read to him
her life story, in Braille.

07:14.634 --> 07:20.539
Maybe by touching those words
he might remember something...

07:21.240 --> 07:28.079
Michelle believes
that this miracle will happen.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.250
Science doesn't believe in miracles.

07:32.251 --> 07:34.753
It is impossible for him
to remember anything....

07:34.754 --> 07:40.058
Impossible is one word that
Mr. Sahai never taught Michelle

07:41.127 --> 07:44.229
And what you call impossible...

07:44.697 --> 07:47.265
she will make possible.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.269
You were written in my destiny...

07:51.471 --> 07:53.271
when I was 2 years old

07:53.439 --> 08:01.580
That night suddenly
all happiness left us....

08:02.114 --> 08:04.549
when my life
entered a black vaccuum

08:04.817 --> 08:09.788
Michelle.... my beautiful baby.

08:09.956 --> 08:14.493
You're not sick anymore...
now you can play in water.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.598
Look who has come! Papa!

08:19.732 --> 08:21.900
What has the doctor told papa?

08:22.034 --> 08:26.171
The doctor has said that
Michelle can't see or hear.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.744
What did you say?

08:34.145 --> 08:36.715
Our Michelle has gone
blind and deaf.

08:51.330 --> 08:56.501
Look at me! Michelle!

09:28.568 --> 09:31.036
I was like an animal

09:31.404 --> 09:33.838
Children loved playing
pranks on me.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.942
So did God.

09:37.543 --> 09:43.048
Mrs. Gomes! Who has tied
these cans on Michelle?

09:43.182 --> 09:46.484
Shh... calm down Michelle,
calm down, baby calm down.

10:02.468 --> 10:04.836
Fire! Fire! Mrs. McNally. Fire!

10:04.971 --> 10:09.374
Help Mrs.McNally
Help. Mrs.McNally

10:13.512 --> 10:17.282
For eight years... every day
a new accident

10:17.283 --> 10:20.685
Hurting someone with a knife,
or breaking her own head!

10:20.686 --> 10:22.454
She could have burnt
the whole house down.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.824
With Michelle,
We can never be happy.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.626
What are you trying to say?

10:27.627 --> 10:30.195
We will send her to an institution.

10:30.863 --> 10:34.065
You mean a mental asylum?

10:34.934 --> 10:37.736
How can you think that?

10:37.737 --> 10:41.039
Cathy, I love her just as much.

10:41.173 --> 10:42.974
But I still want to send her away.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.610
She could cause irreparable damage.

10:45.778 --> 10:48.613
No. I 'm sorry. I don't agree.

10:48.781 --> 10:51.516
There is no other solution.

10:51.517 --> 10:54.285
I have no more patience left.

10:55.454 --> 10:56.688
Sara! Oh my God!

10:59.892 --> 11:04.329
Enough of this...!
This child will be the death of us.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.597
Paul, leave her!

11:05.598 --> 11:09.601
She will not stay her another moment.
She almost... killed Sara.

11:13.005 --> 11:17.542
Let her go!

11:17.677 --> 11:20.445
It's not her fault.

11:20.646 --> 11:23.615
For God's sake!

11:24.283 --> 11:26.117
Try and understand her.

11:28.154 --> 11:31.022
You, l, everyone...
can see, listen and speak!

11:33.259 --> 11:37.162
She is suffocating
in her own darkness.

11:40.132 --> 11:41.966
My baby is suffering

11:49.475 --> 11:54.212
There's this school in Dehradun...

11:54.380 --> 11:57.882
where children like Michelle
are given special training.

11:58.317 --> 12:01.186
If you let me,
I can write for a teacher...

12:01.187 --> 12:03.455
We do not need a teacher...

12:03.889 --> 12:05.523
We need a magician.

12:06.192 --> 12:10.295
I don't want to hear anymore
that there is no cure for our Michelle.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.131
One Last time Paul.

12:13.165 --> 12:15.533
Maybe this is the teacher
who is the magician...

12:15.668 --> 12:19.070
who will bring light
into our Michelle's life.

12:30.683 --> 12:31.883
Debraj.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.087
Ah, Ms. Nair.

12:37.990 --> 12:41.092
Come into the light.

12:41.961 --> 12:45.964
What are you doing, Debraj?
You've just had your eyes operated.

12:46.132 --> 12:49.434
And now what are you doing
holding a dying bulb?

12:49.568 --> 12:51.803
This bulb is dying, Ms. Nair.

12:52.905 --> 12:54.539
I need to stand by it

12:55.708 --> 12:56.508
Am I right?

12:58.944 --> 13:02.881
It's.... it's dying.

13:06.385 --> 13:09.187
You've been drinking again all day.
Haven't you, Debraj?

13:09.188 --> 13:11.256
No, no...

13:12.224 --> 13:17.929
Trying to find a sign for light.
For my deaf and blind children...

13:18.998 --> 13:21.366
Whose light has been
taken away from them.

13:21.500 --> 13:31.476
Light... LlGHT!

13:31.610 --> 13:36.781
Just spell it, Debraj.
L.I.G.H.T. Light

13:36.782 --> 13:40.752
Ah! The difference between
a teacher... and a magician.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.755
You make me so angry
sometimes Debraj.

13:43.923 --> 13:46.291
Angry... Angry

13:46.425 --> 13:48.293
Stop this bullshit

13:48.294 --> 13:52.831
Bullshit Bullshit
Bull. Bull..Bull..shit Bull..shit

13:52.998 --> 13:55.466
I do not have time for your talks.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.003
I have some
very important news for you.

13:59.138 --> 14:00.939
Three guesses....

14:01.040 --> 14:05.076
If it's my termination letter,
put it in the third drawer.

14:05.211 --> 14:07.378
If it's my last salary,
then it goes here in my pocket...

14:07.513 --> 14:10.982
and if it's a notice to vacate this room
then throw it in the dustbin.

14:11.116 --> 14:13.751
And, on your way to any of
these Ms Nair...

14:13.886 --> 14:15.420
could you please fetch me my...

14:15.454 --> 14:17.822
Eye-drops...from that
table over there. Thank you.

14:17.823 --> 14:19.891
You may have three guesses Debraj...

14:20.025 --> 14:22.927
but you have only one choice.
This letter.

14:23.662 --> 14:27.699
An eight-year girl,
in Shimla, Michelle.

14:27.833 --> 14:31.970
She can't see, she can't hear and
her parents don't understand her.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.306
You are their last hope Debraj.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.076
Otherwise they will put her
in the asylum.

14:38.077 --> 14:43.548
You are the best teacher I know.
She needs a teacher, you need a job.

14:43.682 --> 14:44.916
Look up

14:47.519 --> 14:49.988
What do you see in this eye, Ms. Nair?

14:51.523 --> 14:52.857
A great love for me.

14:52.858 --> 14:54.993
You need to get your eyes checked.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.133
- And this one?
- Nothing

15:02.301 --> 15:06.204
Her name is Michelle, isn't it?

15:09.074 --> 15:11.309
I can see everything clearly.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.179
A beautiful morning...

15:16.782 --> 15:18.716
Snow covered streets...

15:19.785 --> 15:21.619
And that little girl...

15:22.388 --> 15:26.491
A lost soul, directionless.

15:27.626 --> 15:34.365
I will give her wings
made of words, Ms. Nair.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.535
I will teach her how to fly.

15:37.536 --> 15:44.042
You couldn't do anything for yourself
and you're out to change others' lives

15:44.810 --> 15:48.346
What happened, do your eyes hurt?

15:49.515 --> 15:51.549
No, not my eyes...

15:52.851 --> 15:57.522
My heart hurts...

16:03.429 --> 16:12.036
listening to your cruel words...

16:14.173 --> 16:22.146
It hurts... it hurts!

16:25.217 --> 16:28.920
that after spending thirty years
in this school...

16:29.054 --> 16:36.961
I 'm just an unseen unheard entity.

16:38.964 --> 16:44.702
When I saw the school
for the last time...

16:44.703 --> 16:51.342
my students were waving to me
in the wrong direction.

16:54.279 --> 16:59.250
Waving to me in the
wrong direction Ms. Nair.

17:02.154 --> 17:06.156
Oh! It... it...

17:07.291 --> 17:08.659
It... hurts...

17:11.663 --> 17:12.829
It hurts.

17:19.471 --> 17:22.339
Destiny had put together
two strange soul- mates.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.344
I was left incomplete by god...

17:27.311 --> 17:30.515
and you were
a battle-weary warrior.

17:34.086 --> 17:36.220
I was waiting in my darkness...

17:37.222 --> 17:39.957
and you were bringing
the flickering light.

17:50.436 --> 17:53.538
Right. Where's the girl?

17:53.672 --> 17:56.874
This is all we needed.
An alcoholic teacher.

18:01.447 --> 18:04.415
Mmmm... Interesting.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.854
Playful, bit of a brat.

18:14.326 --> 18:16.060
And very pretty....

18:35.948 --> 18:41.219
Yes. Yes... someone new...
a new buddy.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.195
You like my glasses, don't you?

18:51.363 --> 18:55.166
Well... you can have them...

18:55.334 --> 18:58.336
here... there you go.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

19:03.809 --> 19:04.942
Happy?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

19:07.779 --> 19:11.082
Teacher... Tea... cher
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

19:14.553 --> 19:17.321
Mr. Sahai, she understands?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

19:17.489 --> 19:22.126
No, she's just imitating me.

19:22.261 --> 19:24.795
Good... good girl

19:32.371 --> 19:33.171
What is she doing?

19:33.305 --> 19:37.041
That's her sign for me.
Her mother

19:37.709 --> 19:42.580
- Oh, she's strong.
- I 'm really sorry, Mr. Sahai

19:42.714 --> 19:44.015
It's alright.

19:46.151 --> 19:47.351
What's this!

19:48.120 --> 19:49.554
What is this bell for?

19:49.688 --> 19:51.856
This is her identity

19:51.990 --> 19:55.493
If she is lost.
we find her through its sound.

19:55.627 --> 19:56.861
Take it off!

20:01.266 --> 20:04.936
When you think, that
your child is an animal...

20:05.037 --> 20:12.109
- What do you expect of others?
- It's your job to make her human.

20:12.244 --> 20:14.078
How do you plan to do this?

20:15.380 --> 20:16.881
These Fingers, Mr. McNally.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.451
They're eyes of the blind...

20:20.586 --> 20:22.320
Voice of the mute...

20:23.088 --> 20:24.622
poetry of the deaf.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.293
Raise it to a sword...

20:29.461 --> 20:31.896
clench it for strength.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.965
They can feed you and slap you,

20:34.099 --> 20:37.602
They can point you towards God
and sometimes... even the door.

20:39.137 --> 20:43.074
It isn't as easy as you make it seem.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.977
My daughter is like me...

20:46.111 --> 20:48.379
- Stubborn...
- lnsolent.

20:49.681 --> 20:51.515
Not you. Your daughter

20:51.650 --> 20:54.652
Lunch... will be served
shortly, Mr. Sahai.

20:54.786 --> 20:57.455
Thank you. Mrs. McNally,
I 'm so hungry.

21:06.598 --> 21:10.067
Thank you Lord, for the bread
on our plate

21:10.202 --> 21:14.138
for the air we breathe,
so fresh and pure.

21:14.306 --> 21:18.409
For kindness and faith,
we are thankful to Thee.

21:18.577 --> 21:23.748
Life's treasures and loved ones,
we hold and cherish.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.326
No!

21:35.661 --> 21:37.628
Leave her, Mr. Sahai.

21:37.763 --> 21:40.865
No. She has to learn how to behave.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.734
Leave her hand Mr. Sahai!

21:43.869 --> 21:47.605
This is the only reason
she hasn't learnt anything.

21:48.707 --> 21:52.209
I will not tolerate this
in front of my guests.

21:52.344 --> 21:55.246
Michelle eats like this.

21:55.380 --> 21:59.317
Either she eats from her plate
or stays hungry.

21:59.451 --> 22:00.651
Am I understood?

22:00.919 --> 22:04.288
Let her eat, you will
get another plate.

22:04.289 --> 22:07.792
I... don't have a problem
with the plate, Mr. McNally.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.860
The plate... is fine.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.363
Let her go.
This is no way to teach.

22:12.497 --> 22:15.199
Don't you feel pity
for this handicapped child?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.902
Pity? And on this devil...?

22:18.003 --> 22:20.571
so she can do as she pleases?

22:20.739 --> 22:23.074
No Mr. McNally,
I have pity on you...

22:23.241 --> 22:25.643
and don't you dare
call her handicapped.

22:25.644 --> 22:28.813
That's enough!

22:28.980 --> 22:32.283
Do not forget that you
are a paid servant in this house.

22:32.417 --> 22:34.385
A Teacher! Mr. McNally...

22:34.519 --> 22:37.021
not a paid servant...
A paid teacher.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.190
Leave her, right now.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.658
No! You leave. All of you.

22:40.659 --> 22:42.526
Mr. Sahai,
handling Michelle like this...

22:42.527 --> 22:46.163
Mrs. McNally... you had said that
you'd cooperate.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.265
All right. there's no point in
going on like this.

22:48.266 --> 22:51.369
Let's give him a chance.
Let him do his job Paul.

22:51.503 --> 22:55.706
Leave!

23:10.622 --> 23:13.391
Martha, I 'm really sorry,
for today's lunch

23:13.525 --> 23:15.059
Don't worry Cathy.

23:15.193 --> 23:18.829
He's a new teacher, that's why.
Isn't it, Paul?

23:18.964 --> 23:21.732
Martha, I 'll drop you home.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.202
Paul, I will speak to Mr.Sahai...

23:30.842 --> 23:33.944
I am very hungry
I am going to eat...

23:34.613 --> 23:39.150
And if you behave
then you can eat too.

23:56.168 --> 23:57.401
Spoon!

24:00.338 --> 24:03.541
No. You will not use
your hands to eat your food.

24:03.675 --> 24:06.977
Open it, open it, open,
and open your hands.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.979
Leave, leave it. Leave it.

24:09.314 --> 24:13.684
Sit. sit. sit. Sit down.

24:18.557 --> 24:21.292
You will not touch the food
with your hands.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.093
Sit down... sit.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.067
Stop it... stop it.

24:30.202 --> 24:34.972
Just stop it, just stop it.
Stop it. Just stop it,

24:35.106 --> 24:38.776
Just just stop it.
STOP lT.

24:40.011 --> 24:42.346
Spoon. Spoon.

24:46.418 --> 24:49.286
There is going to be no mother.
Your mother's not here.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.489
Just your teacher.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.857
Your teacher... just me

24:54.759 --> 24:55.993
Where you going?

24:58.096 --> 25:00.264
Where do you think
you are going...

25:00.265 --> 25:03.734
you are not going to
go out... don't...

25:04.903 --> 25:07.071
Wait... where do you think
you are running from?

25:07.205 --> 25:08.639
You are not going out...

25:10.642 --> 25:14.245
come along... with me...
come on.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.047
Come here... Sit.

25:17.849 --> 25:22.586
You are going to eat your food
with a spoon. Come on.

25:23.054 --> 25:28.859
You are going to eat your food
with a spoon, come on,

25:28.994 --> 25:31.161
Open your mouth... Open it...

25:31.296 --> 25:32.630
Open your mouth...

25:32.764 --> 25:37.935
Open, Open it...
open it. Open it, open it.

25:38.069 --> 25:42.506
Yes. yes. yes... very good.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.046
You little brat....

25:54.452 --> 25:56.186
That should cool you down.

25:57.355 --> 25:59.723
This is no way to teach...

26:04.796 --> 26:06.730
We thank you Lord

26:09.401 --> 26:11.835
For the food on this plate...

26:15.240 --> 26:17.474
For the air we breathe.

26:17.943 --> 26:21.211
So pure and clear.

26:21.746 --> 26:27.384
For good health and peace.
For beauty and love.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.086
Please don't make
a hasty decision

26:29.087 --> 26:31.288
Paul I know that his way
of teaching is eccentric...

26:31.289 --> 26:33.857
He's rude, he's arrogant,
and he's an alcoholic.

26:33.992 --> 26:35.225
He's not fit to be a teacher.

26:35.226 --> 26:37.595
But, you didn't see
what he did today...

26:37.729 --> 26:42.099
- Michelle actually ate today with...
- What do you want Cathy?

26:42.100 --> 26:45.536
Get insulted in my own house?

26:48.373 --> 26:51.241
- No.
- Then he's got to go.

26:51.409 --> 26:53.344
I hope you understand.

27:00.251 --> 27:03.053
The woods are lovely...
dark and deep

27:03.054 --> 27:05.990
- But I have promises to keep...
- Mr. Sahai...

27:06.124 --> 27:09.226
And miles to go before I can
find the damn envelope. Ah, yes!

27:09.361 --> 27:12.463
I need to talk to you, Mr. Sahai.
Are you busy?

27:12.597 --> 27:16.834
No. Not at all. I was just writing
to my friend, about Michelle.

27:16.968 --> 27:21.939
She has learnt her first lesson
today... etiquette, behavior.

27:23.241 --> 27:24.775
That you do not possess.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.878
Anyway I 'll skip the pleasantries.

27:28.046 --> 27:31.915
I want you to leave this house.

27:32.050 --> 27:36.720
I will not leave without
completing my job.

27:37.422 --> 27:39.623
I 've only just started.
Still a long way to go. You know.

27:39.624 --> 27:43.327
I don't like the way you teach.

27:43.461 --> 27:46.764
And I don't like your interference.

27:46.898 --> 27:53.237
This is your train ticket... Cheque.
And your termination letter.

27:57.342 --> 28:02.379
We don't need you anymore.
You're taking the first train tomorrow.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.615
And Michelle takes the next
to the mental asylum?

28:05.884 --> 28:09.887
Now she's deaf blind and also
mentally retarded.

28:09.888 --> 28:12.389
My daughter... is my responsibility.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.224
And mine too, Mr. McNally.

28:15.293 --> 28:17.027
You do understand that this will...

28:17.162 --> 28:19.229
destroy her completely.

28:22.167 --> 28:26.103
Train will leave exactly at seven.

28:26.671 --> 28:32.676
And please... put this back
where it belongs. Good night.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.845
Goodnight.

28:41.119 --> 28:42.319
Goodnight!

28:44.689 --> 28:46.924
Mr. Sahai must have left by now.

28:47.826 --> 28:53.497
We'll talk about Michelle
after I return.

29:06.211 --> 29:09.813
What is happening in this house?
Mrs. Gomes!

29:11.649 --> 29:13.050
What is going on here?

29:13.418 --> 29:14.885
This is ridiculous.

29:15.053 --> 29:19.423
Mrs. Gomes, I don't understand what
is going on in this house today.

29:19.424 --> 29:22.326
Good morning, Mrs. McNally.
And how are you today?

29:22.327 --> 29:24.094
Mr Sahai...?

29:24.095 --> 29:26.196
We thought you would have left.

29:26.197 --> 29:29.399
Just shifting rooms Mrs. McNally.
I never leave my work incomplete.

29:29.534 --> 29:30.734
What do you want?

29:31.703 --> 29:34.905
Same thing you want... that
Michelle becomes independent.

29:35.039 --> 29:37.741
And for that, I need time.

29:37.876 --> 29:40.277
You know that Paul...

29:40.278 --> 29:41.378
Has gone out for twenty days.

29:41.379 --> 29:43.814
And those twenty days
belong to Michelle and me.

29:43.815 --> 29:45.983
Now, don't say No, Mrs. McNally.

29:45.984 --> 29:51.021
No! It's not possible. You won't
take advantage of Paul's absence.

29:55.059 --> 29:58.662
Oh my God! Oh my God!...
I don't believe this!

29:58.830 --> 30:00.264
This is ridiculous.

30:00.265 --> 30:01.965
I don't believe this!
What have you done?

30:01.966 --> 30:05.869
- This is Paul's study...
- Now this will be Michelle's study.

30:06.004 --> 30:09.106
- Mrs. Gomes! Put that back!
- No, Ma'am, he's right!

30:09.874 --> 30:12.342
Oh ho! So the servants also
listen to you now!

30:12.477 --> 30:15.245
Who are you to take over my house?

30:17.081 --> 30:18.182
Michelle's teacher.

30:18.316 --> 30:23.020
Were... were Mr. Sahai,
not anymore.

30:23.021 --> 30:27.658
I am your last hope.

30:28.326 --> 30:32.529
If I leave today
then after a few days...

30:33.331 --> 30:34.898
Michelle will reach the asylum.

30:34.899 --> 30:38.302
Mr Sahai... Mr Sahai!

30:38.436 --> 30:39.870
Mr Sahai!

30:40.004 --> 30:41.205
Yes?

30:42.407 --> 30:46.343
As long as I live, my daughter
will never enter the asylum.

30:46.778 --> 30:47.678
Do you understand?

30:50.949 --> 30:52.683
My mother always...

30:54.085 --> 30:55.519
said the same thing.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.857
That as long as I live...

31:01.326 --> 31:04.294
my daughter will never leave me.

31:06.331 --> 31:13.170
But one day, she herself...

31:17.976 --> 31:20.444
Dragged her to the asylum.

31:25.183 --> 31:36.793
And she got lost behind
the asylum's iron doors.

31:42.901 --> 31:46.770
Michelle is deaf and
blind, Mrs McNally!

31:46.771 --> 31:50.173
She is not mentally retarded!

31:54.579 --> 32:00.817
She need to recognize words...

32:02.287 --> 32:06.790
Every thing that she touches,
that she eats...

32:08.393 --> 32:11.762
Has a name, which has a meaning.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.498
I will teach her to speak...

32:14.632 --> 32:18.669
through signs.

32:19.971 --> 32:25.375
Till she is secure in her house,
this can't happen.

32:25.376 --> 32:29.212
That's why!

32:30.081 --> 32:31.381
Firstly...

32:32.483 --> 32:35.052
I will have to change
this part of the house.

32:35.186 --> 32:40.257
Everything should be new for her.

32:40.491 --> 32:44.161
No papers, no books...
Only empty walls.

32:44.195 --> 32:45.862
I 'll even change
the smell of this room.

32:45.863 --> 32:48.799
Secondly, only I will have
a right over Michelle.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.401
She will rely only on me!

32:51.402 --> 32:53.270
Third thing, no one including you
will be allowed here.

32:53.271 --> 32:56.406
No, no no... don't shake your head!
Look at me... look!

32:56.407 --> 33:01.478
It's difficult but it will
have to be done for Michelle.

33:01.612 --> 33:04.548
Fourth thing, all I want is
time and trust.

33:04.682 --> 33:10.187
No salary, no allowances,
nothing and... no alcohol

33:10.955 --> 33:13.924
And the fifth thing...

33:18.029 --> 33:23.900
So, when do I get
charge of my student?

33:28.973 --> 33:30.207
This evening.

33:40.551 --> 33:46.323
You know. Mrs. McNally,
I wish I could sing...

33:46.324 --> 33:50.327
but my singing is so... pathetic.

34:08.112 --> 34:15.052
Dear Ms. Nair,
I have good news.

34:16.754 --> 34:25.395
You will be unhappy to know that
the magician is at work

34:26.563 --> 34:30.766
Today is Michelle's first day...

34:30.768 --> 34:31.967
- Mr. Sahai...
- In school.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.007
Your student.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.811
You kept your promise, Mrs. McNally

34:44.081 --> 34:47.516
School has started,

34:47.518 --> 34:51.755
and parents are not allowed.
So you should leave.

34:57.428 --> 35:00.931
I have never left her alone.

35:01.065 --> 35:05.802
Please take care of her.
Don't be harsh on her

35:06.003 --> 35:07.003
No.

35:11.008 --> 35:13.910
- She is looking for me.
- Yes I know.

35:15.079 --> 35:18.181
She's going to come to you now.
Leave, Mrs. McNally.

35:18.316 --> 35:19.850
Please leave. Get back.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.659
- No, I can't take this...
- 20 days!

35:29.794 --> 35:31.795
- You cannot touch her for 20 days.
- But its time for her to eat.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.563
Yes I know Mrs. McNally.
You must leave now.

35:33.564 --> 35:35.832
- Please. Please. Can l...?
- I said leave.

35:51.082 --> 35:57.187
NO! No. No more mother.
No more father. Just me.

35:57.321 --> 36:00.423
Me, your friend. Your Friend.
Look see see ya ya, your teacher.

36:00.558 --> 36:06.396
Friend. Friend!

36:26.117 --> 36:33.523
The magic has begun, Ms. Nair!
The magic!

36:33.658 --> 36:36.526
I will change her life.

36:36.594 --> 36:40.964
The magic has begun!
Magic!

36:58.516 --> 37:05.689
Wake up, Miss... Michelle McNally.
We all pass through this darkness

37:05.823 --> 37:08.291
Once in which you are living.

37:09.493 --> 37:15.398
So don't remain in the dark.

37:15.933 --> 37:21.037
Come into the light!
Light. Light.

37:21.172 --> 37:25.875
Yes! Yes! Yes! Light!

37:27.845 --> 37:30.247
The alphabets for the world start
with A, B, C, D, E but yours...

37:30.248 --> 37:37.821
Start with B, L, A, C, K...

37:39.924 --> 37:43.226
Black, black, black

37:46.297 --> 37:49.499
Your alphabets, your world
are different Michelle.

37:49.634 --> 37:54.604
You are different, you are, you are,
and you are different...

37:55.239 --> 37:58.942
And are proud that you're different.

38:14.058 --> 38:20.897
Here. This is cake.
Yes cake, C.cake, C.A.K.E.

38:22.066 --> 38:29.239
Cake. C.A.K.E. Cake. Cake.

38:29.373 --> 38:35.245
C.A.K.E. spell it.
Spell it spell... cake

38:35.413 --> 38:37.914
cake on my hands.
Spell it. Spell it.

38:37.915 --> 38:41.851
Cake. Cake.

38:45.856 --> 38:51.227
Don't you dare touch the cake!

38:51.996 --> 38:55.732
Mrs. McNally, could you...

38:55.866 --> 39:02.605
Mrs, Mrs McNally,
could you get some light?

39:02.707 --> 39:04.507
I 'm coming! I 'm coming.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

39:05.276 --> 39:07.644
Oh God! Is Michelle all right?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

39:07.645 --> 39:09.746
Can you get some light? Oh. Oh!

39:11.549 --> 39:15.118
Mr. Sahai! Mr. Sahai
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

39:15.820 --> 39:18.822
- Good evening Mrs. McNally
- Do you need any help?

39:18.823 --> 39:21.725
Do I look... as though
I need some help?

39:22.293 --> 39:25.895
Well, that looked
like a knockout to me.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.498
Knockout, Knockout yes.

39:33.738 --> 39:39.976
Eyes are not important
as compared to light.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.911
I have learnt this,
while teaching Michelle.

39:43.814 --> 39:47.450
In darkness, even eyes are of no use.

39:51.889 --> 39:58.728
The first round was a knock out.
But the next round will be mine.

40:00.531 --> 40:02.365
Good luck to you, Mr. Sahai.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.567
Good luck.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

40:07.004 --> 40:10.407
Come along, yes,
come along... Here!

40:10.741 --> 40:15.478
This is water. No, no...
don't be afraid. don't be afraid.

40:15.613 --> 40:18.748
- Mr. Sahai..
- Yes?

40:18.883 --> 40:21.718
Michelle is scared of water.

40:21.719 --> 40:26.423
And I want to take this
fear out of her mind.

40:26.724 --> 40:29.325
In five days, she will be swimming.

40:29.326 --> 40:30.994
Round Two has begun.

40:30.995 --> 40:33.329
Hey! Where are you going?
Come here.

40:35.132 --> 40:38.168
Where are you going?
Come back...

40:38.169 --> 40:42.539
careful, careful.
Careful now. Watch it! Watch it!

40:42.540 --> 40:43.840
Watch out!
I told you to be careful.

40:43.841 --> 40:48.478
Calm down. Calm down, calm down.
This is a thorn.

40:56.153 --> 40:57.587
Balm,

41:06.096 --> 41:07.297
balm.

41:09.733 --> 41:11.367
To soothe the pain.

41:21.111 --> 41:23.546
Your first handshake, Mr. Sahai.

41:23.881 --> 41:27.016
Yes, we're friends now.

41:34.859 --> 41:38.695
And... my first flying kiss.

41:40.598 --> 41:47.871
She needs to learn that
she is destined to thorns.

41:51.141 --> 41:54.110
Those very thorns that adorned
Jesus's crown.

42:03.053 --> 42:05.622
Right Mrs. McNally?

42:07.124 --> 42:08.124
Yes!

42:24.642 --> 42:27.410
I was slowly understanding
relationships...

42:27.878 --> 42:33.016
Between a thorn and pain...
between water and thirst...

42:33.984 --> 42:35.318
Bird...

42:35.452 --> 42:37.887
But one relationship
was still strange to me...

42:39.390 --> 42:41.024
Of names and meanings.

42:41.025 --> 42:42.191
Bird...

42:47.264 --> 42:52.769
Ball. B.A.L.L.
ball. ball.. ball..

43:06.483 --> 43:16.225
W.A.T.E.R.

43:17.861 --> 43:21.264
Water. water... water

43:30.474 --> 43:34.177
This is... Napkin...

43:36.213 --> 43:40.950
- SPOON
- No. no. This is not spoon

43:41.085 --> 43:48.958
This is... napkin, Napkin..
Say ' Napkin' .

43:52.129 --> 43:53.796
Ah! I am fed up.

44:03.641 --> 44:07.276
No, Mrs. McNally, I will not
allow you to take Michelle yet

44:07.411 --> 44:08.845
She hasn't learnt anything yet.

44:08.979 --> 44:12.682
She knows words,
but not the meanings.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.917
She still calls napkin, spoon.

44:14.918 --> 44:15.952
It's still a long way to go, you know

44:15.953 --> 44:17.987
How much longer Mr. Sahai?

44:18.122 --> 44:19.455
Nineteen days have passed

44:19.456 --> 44:22.625
The promise was for 20 days,
I still have a few hours

44:22.626 --> 44:25.194
What can happen in a few hours?

44:26.363 --> 44:27.997
Knowledge can
come in a flash Mrs.McNally.

44:27.998 --> 44:30.400
It's like lighting a candle....

44:30.534 --> 44:33.736
Once this candle is lit, the whole
house will be filled with light.

44:33.871 --> 44:35.972
Believe me, this miracle
can happen any time...

44:35.973 --> 44:40.743
And Paul can come at any moment.
I 'm really very sorry.

44:41.812 --> 44:46.449
I will come to get Michelle tomorrow.
At sunrise

44:48.152 --> 44:52.889
And I shall pray there is
no sunrise tomorrow, Mrs McNally

44:53.023 --> 44:54.157
Good night

45:13.644 --> 45:14.644
What?

45:15.612 --> 45:19.849
You've made a fine young lady
out of my Michelle!

45:25.923 --> 45:48.311
Thank you.

46:00.157 --> 46:01.057
Spoon...

46:24.348 --> 46:30.753
Try and understand Michelle,
every word has a meaning.

46:30.888 --> 46:35.725
And without words, you will
never come out of darkness.

46:35.859 --> 46:39.595
You will never be able
to see the light!

46:40.297 --> 46:44.600
You will you will never be
able to see the light.

46:44.768 --> 46:47.236
They will put this bell around you
and call you a cow.

46:47.371 --> 46:50.373
C.O.W... cow.

46:50.507 --> 46:53.810
You will become an animal Michelle.
Just an animal

46:53.944 --> 46:56.112
Michelle...

46:56.246 --> 46:59.315
They will put you in an asylum.

46:59.483 --> 47:01.450
And this time
I won't let this happen.

47:01.585 --> 47:05.454
You will have to learn Michelle.
Are you listening?

47:05.455 --> 47:10.259
You are my last hope.
Michelle, Michelle...

47:10.260 --> 47:12.295
- Michelle, are you listening?
- You'll have to leave now Mr. Sahai.

47:12.296 --> 47:14.997
No, I am not going to
leave Mrs. McNally

47:15.699 --> 47:17.567
I will not give up so easily.

47:17.568 --> 47:19.535
I have kept my promise.
Now it's your turn.

47:19.536 --> 47:23.406
But it's not yet over Mrs. McNally.
There are still a few minutes left.

47:23.407 --> 47:26.442
Paul can come at any moment.
Mr. Sahai. I 'm helpless

47:26.443 --> 47:28.578
Yes. Mrs. McNally.
But she has to learn.

47:28.579 --> 47:30.580
- Mr. Sahai...
- She has to learn...

47:30.714 --> 47:34.517
that the hand she is holding has a name.
That you are mother,

47:34.651 --> 47:40.790
mother... M.O.T.H.E.R... mother.

47:45.896 --> 47:47.430
and that is FATHER.

47:51.702 --> 47:54.337
- Paul, I was just...
- Leave, Mr. Sahai.

48:20.964 --> 48:25.001
Dear Ms. Nair, you will be
delighted to know...

48:25.002 --> 48:29.772
that after having spent 20 days
with little Michelle, I have failed.

48:30.540 --> 48:35.344
However, if you're smiling
at the thought of looking into my eyes again...

48:35.812 --> 48:37.747
you are terribly mistaken.

48:48.125 --> 48:51.127
Mrs.Gomes, will you stop her?

48:51.128 --> 48:54.897
Let her be Mr. Sahai.
She's very happy today

48:58.635 --> 49:02.071
No! Stop it Michelle.
You little brat.

49:02.072 --> 49:05.308
I am not going to allow you
to do this to me.

49:06.076 --> 49:08.477
I might have been asked to leave...

49:08.478 --> 49:12.615
but I am not going to leave you
to behave like this.

49:17.220 --> 49:19.388
Stop it Michelle.
Stop it!

49:19.389 --> 49:23.259
You won't forget what I 've
taught you in 20 days... sit down

49:23.260 --> 49:25.761
- Please leave her Mr. Sahai...
- Sit... sit down.

49:25.762 --> 49:31.467
You will use this napkin on your
neck and use a spoon... to eat.

49:31.468 --> 49:34.070
No, you are not going to throw...

49:58.462 --> 50:00.029
Come on, Come here...

50:02.132 --> 50:04.700
You brat... you want to
throw water at me!

50:04.835 --> 50:10.106
Let me teach you what water is!
Come here! What water is, come on!

50:10.307 --> 50:16.212
This is water... water... water...

50:16.346 --> 50:20.583
Give me your hand.. This is woah...
Water... water...

50:20.717 --> 50:22.451
Understand? Water!

51:37.294 --> 51:47.369
Woah!

51:51.108 --> 51:55.044
Water... it's water...

51:55.212 --> 52:00.883
W.A.T.E.R.

52:24.107 --> 52:25.508
Mrs. McNally!

52:33.183 --> 52:40.656
Yes... this is 'Grass' .
G.R.A.S.S. spell it..

52:42.159 --> 52:45.161
Very good... Very good..
Mrs. McNally!

52:46.429 --> 52:54.003
That's 'FLOWER' flower...
flower... F.L.O.W.E.R... flower.

52:54.171 --> 53:00.442
Mrs. McNally! Mr. McNally!
Mr. McNally! Mr. McNally!

53:02.012 --> 53:05.614
What's wrong Mr. Sahai?
Is Michelle all right?

53:05.749 --> 53:08.751
Michelle. Michelle she...
Mrs. McNally. She knows.

53:09.186 --> 53:11.253
She knows, She knows
the meaning of words.

53:11.254 --> 53:14.490
She actually. actually
knows the meaning of words.

53:14.624 --> 53:16.058
Look. Look!

53:19.529 --> 53:22.398
Yes, Michelle...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

53:22.532 --> 53:25.100
Mother. Mother...

54:55.292 --> 55:02.064
This is 'Teacher' . 'Tea..cher'

55:06.069 --> 55:07.303
Tee...

55:08.371 --> 55:09.571
Yes...

55:19.683 --> 55:22.384
Yes, he's your Tee

55:41.204 --> 55:42.938
Dear Ms. Nair...

55:48.812 --> 55:50.779
You'll be happy to know....

55:53.783 --> 55:55.217
That I have...

56:00.390 --> 56:01.757
I have...

56:30.153 --> 56:34.189
That day you had won your
first battle over my darkness.

56:35.492 --> 56:37.526
But today you don't
remember anything.

56:38.828 --> 56:41.296
Now I will fight
against your darkness.

56:42.265 --> 56:47.136
I'll teach you everything
you taught me

57:42.792 --> 57:46.728
Water. The first word
that you taught me...

57:47.163 --> 57:49.965
and after that...

57:50.834 --> 57:56.872
You typed every little
detail on my hand....

57:57.340 --> 58:01.477
like a maestro playing a symphony

58:04.380 --> 58:05.380
Cathy!

58:06.049 --> 58:07.483
Martha...

58:07.617 --> 58:11.420
When did you return from London?
Oh! It's so good to see you.

58:11.621 --> 58:13.655
Merry Christmas.

58:15.792 --> 58:19.695
- Mr. McNally...
- Coming, Mr Sahai. Just a moment

58:20.263 --> 58:23.131
I 'd like you to meet Mr. Fernandez,

58:23.132 --> 58:25.634
principal of the
King Edward University.

58:25.635 --> 58:28.570
I want Michelle to study
in their college

58:28.705 --> 58:31.206
It's an honor to meet you,
Mr. Fernandez.

58:31.841 --> 58:33.709
I don't believe how time
has passed, Martha

58:33.710 --> 58:35.477
Let me prove it to you...

58:37.046 --> 58:37.846
Hello... Come

58:41.084 --> 58:42.384
Did you recognize her?

58:43.820 --> 58:47.155
- My younger daughter
- Sara

58:47.156 --> 58:49.558
Sara, this is aunt Martha,
an old friend of mine

58:49.559 --> 58:52.494
- Oh! Hello, aunt Martha...
- But where is my dear Michelle?

58:52.495 --> 58:54.463
- I can't wait to see her
- Ah Michelle.

58:54.464 --> 58:55.831
Have you seen Michelle?

58:58.034 --> 59:00.836
Yes... I think
she's inside, excuse me.

59:01.471 --> 59:06.542
Come... we'll go look for her.

59:37.006 --> 59:38.473
Ah! There she is

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.767
Mr. Sahai. Look at that girl.

01:00:38.768 --> 01:00:42.371
She can't hear or see, and still...

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:44.973
just look at her,
it's wonderful.

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:48.944
That's Michelle McNally...

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:55.417
- The girl I was talking about.
- That's impossible Mr. Sahai.

01:00:55.485 --> 01:01:00.022
Impossible is a word that I have
never taught her Mr. Fernandez.

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:02.691
There are special schools
for such children...

01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:05.627
where they are taught many things.

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:11.733
To make baskets, weave carpets...

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:18.140
Have you heard of a girl like Michelle
getting admission in a normal college?

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:19.441
No.

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:21.576
But I would love to.

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:24.179
How will she understand
the lectures?

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.448
I will sit with her
in the classroom.

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:29.685
She will learn everything
through signs

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.054
Every word, every letter.

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:40.562
Michelle... meet your Principal

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:50.205
Yes yes... I 've told him...

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:52.908
you want admission in arts,
not science

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:57.679
Mr. Sahai I will have to consult
the trustees on this.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:03.385
You get few chances
for good deeds.

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:07.222
And I hope that you will
not lose this opportunity.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:11.359
Cheers?

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:20.068
Mr. Sahai, you know this university
is for normal students.

01:02:20.203 --> 01:02:23.071
But because of your faith
in Michelle...

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:25.273
and because we believe
you are a good teacher...

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:28.610
- We will interview Michelle.
- Thank you.

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:31.747
But today, you cannot
interpret for Michelle.

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:37.152
We have called a special teacher,
who doesn't know either of you.

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:38.420
- She will interpret.
- They will interview you.

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:41.757
Another interpreter, not me, ok?

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:50.932
Ah, there she is.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:55.570
Mrs Nair...?

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:58.807
Welcome Ms.Nair, meet Mr. Sahai.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.176
- Hello, Ms. Nair.
- Hello.

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:02.477
Light

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:16.358
Are you ready for the interview?

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:19.594
We're ready, Sir.

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:25.367
Why does she want to study?

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:28.603
Why do you want to study?

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:32.574
I want to study...

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:37.179
and learn...
so that I may live with dignity,

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:40.615
with independence...
and to be alive.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:46.254
How many oceans are
there in the world?

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:54.596
For me every drop of water
is an ocean

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.665
She is not answering my question.

01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:59.634
How many oceans
are there in the world?

01:03:59.635 --> 01:04:03.839
They want a straight answer
to their question

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:14.816
If we are in lndia,
on which side will America be?

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:17.819
If you are in lndia,
which side is America?

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:45.547
The world is round.
So America can be on any side.

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:52.320
- What does knowledge mean to her?
- What does knowledge mean to you?

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:58.226
Knowledge... is everything

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:07.769
Knowledge is spirit, wisdom,
courage, light, sound.

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:12.674
Knowledge is my Bible, God...

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:15.310
Tee!

01:05:15.444 --> 01:05:17.512
knowledge is my teacher

01:05:17.647 --> 01:05:21.349
Bravo! Excellent.

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:29.324
Congratulations, Mr. Sahai.

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:33.261
Your student is now a
part of our university.

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:42.170
Thank you... Thank you

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:52.881
I answered
every question they asked.

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:57.052
Michelle looks so happy
today Paul.

01:05:57.153 --> 01:05:59.721
Can't stop talking about
the interview

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:03.291
She hasn't stopped smiling all day.

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:04.659
Why not?

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:08.296
A girl who couldn't
sit at the dining table...

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:13.969
has a seat in the university today.
Unbelievable.

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:15.971
Can you imagine?

01:06:16.105 --> 01:06:21.910
Can you imagine the day
when we see Michelle as a graduate?

01:06:22.211 --> 01:06:26.548
Ah, it's going to be such a
special day, isn't it Sara?

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:29.451
Yes, of course, mama.

01:06:29.585 --> 01:06:32.687
Whatever Michelle does
is always special. Isn't it?

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.758
Excuse me,
I need to finish my sketch.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.735
- Good evening Sara.
- Good evening.

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:49.471
Mr. Sahai, congratulations.

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:52.841
You have performed yet...
another miracle.

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.677
Still a long way to go, Mr. McNally

01:06:56.178 --> 01:07:00.148
The journey has just begun.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:03.485
Teacher!

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:11.359
She's been waiting for
her gift for so long.

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:25.407
What is this?

01:07:27.576 --> 01:07:31.780
Your friend, for... life.

01:07:31.947 --> 01:07:35.450
I don't need. I don't want
to be dependent on this.

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:46.928
This will not make you dependent.

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:51.933
It will make you independent.

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:54.002
Do you understand?

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.608
It was the beginning of a new life...

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:37.245
A new feeling, a new horizon...

01:08:37.846 --> 01:08:41.950
You had faith in me...
and I had faith in my wings.

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:45.720
Remember how happy I was
that day?

01:08:56.198 --> 01:09:00.033
Is it wise
to let Michelle live alone?

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:01.502
She is not alone,

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:05.540
Mrs. Gomes will also live here.
I will also live next door.

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:11.880
University is close by,
she will meet new people.

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:16.951
Besides, we can't protect
her all her life.

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:18.051
Don't worry. She'll be fine!

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.154
What's wrong with you, Sara?

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:22.290
We were all just laughing
now suddenly you're fighting.

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:25.093
It's very irritating, mama.
Anything that I put anywhere...

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:27.261
She picks it up and puts it
somewhere else.

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:30.198
Ma, I love her very much,
I really do.

01:09:30.198 --> 01:09:32.600
But... Please... leave me
out of this. Ok?

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.669
She's very excited, sweetie.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:36.938
- Please understand
- I understand everything.

01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:38.406
It's always about her, right?

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.241
Her excitement, her happiness,

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:42.443
She's the one
who means everything to you

01:09:42.444 --> 01:09:44.011
But what about me?

01:09:44.145 --> 01:09:46.413
Should I speak to you
in sign language?

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.283
Paul, I can't believe
what she's saying. Oh My God...

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:54.689
Michelle!

01:09:55.858 --> 01:09:59.460
- Michelle!
- No, Mrs. McNally. Leave her alone.

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:04.365
With every fall, she'll rise higher.

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:07.602
I fell.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.505
That's the spirit.

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:20.381
I want you to walk alone,
without any help.

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:27.188
50 steps. Straight, and
then right. Understood?

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:45.340
JoJo... go slow...
I 'm getting old.

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:48.042
Oh! I 'm so sorry.

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:02.890
Where is she going?

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:09.264
Where... are you going?

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:14.269
No no no... This is the
wrong way... it's this way.

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:19.574
No... it's... tch!
We're getting late...

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:21.242
Come on...

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:24.545
Hurry up

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:28.816
Yes, come on...

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:33.354
Run, run, run!
Yes!

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:43.464
- 38
- Present.

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:45.533
- 39
- Present

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.735
- 40
- Present

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:51.906
- 41
- Present

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:56.744
- 42
- Present.

01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:02.083
There was so much to learn
and there was such little time.

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:10.191
24 hours without tiring...
Your fingers would speak to me.

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:14.929
Whether life starts from
the womb or from the earth...

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:21.202
Its journey starts from darkness
and ends in darkness.

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:26.607
One day we will all have to pass
through this darkness...

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:29.210
and reach into the light.

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:41.322
New doors opened up for me...

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:46.928
new friends, new stories,
new poetry...

01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:49.330
a new way of looking at the world

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:54.235
'What you see is what you dream'

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:58.339
No. She, she... she disagrees
with the poet

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:03.778
Eyes don't see dreams
but the mind does.

01:13:03.912 --> 01:13:10.184
I can't see with my eyes,
yet I dream.

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:15.523
Our dream is that one-day
I would graduate.

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:33.574
- Are you ready?
- Ready...

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:37.845
- Tree...
- Tree...

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:40.882
- Burr...
- Butterfly...

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:43.551
- Bir...
- Bird...

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:46.687
- Fish...
- Fish...

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:49.290
- Bee..
- Bee..

01:13:57.199 --> 01:14:02.303
The best years of my life...

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:05.606
Memories of which
bring joy even today

01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:22.356
It's ok....
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:24.559
It's all right!
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:34.402
What...? Tickly...?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.515
It's not going to snow.

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:50.151
Please concentrate on your studies

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.623
No, no... you wont need the
umbrella at all, concentrate.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.705
Give me the umbrella.

01:15:11.473 --> 01:15:14.976
Hey stop it...
Give me the umbrella...

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:53.214
- Can't you see
- I 'm sorry sir

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:57.118
Hey... no... no. no.

01:15:57.452 --> 01:15:59.620
It's alright... it's alright.

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:03.224
No, no...

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:08.062
You are too slow!
How will you pass?

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:10.765
You'll try?

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.199
Let's watch it

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:19.407
This is ten words in one minute

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:25.046
You're going to try and do thirty.
Thirty words, my foot!

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:38.993
- Pass?
- No fail.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:49.837
No, not in one or two subjects,
you have failed in all of them.

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:57.612
Congratulations.

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:20.935
People celebrate success
but we celebrated failure

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:25.573
While eating ice cream
you told me the story of the spider

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:29.010
Who after a lot of tries
made her home.

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:33.080
After all, failure is
the first step towards success...

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:37.018
but for me these steps
were never-ending.

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:43.791
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:47.194
Mr. Sahai, how are you?
How is Michelle?

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:51.232
She's all right,
her results have come out.

01:17:51.733 --> 01:17:52.700
And what happened?

01:17:54.269 --> 01:17:56.303
She has failed again.

01:17:58.473 --> 01:18:02.176
But she said that
her papers were easy.

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:07.515
She lied, so she could
enjoy her holidays

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:16.323
But you said that only after falling
can a person rise higher.

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:22.463
Before I fall, I want her
to learn how to fly.

01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:28.569
I 'm getting old, you know?

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:29.837
Oh no...

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:34.442
What happened?
Michelle has failed again?

01:18:34.743 --> 01:18:37.912
Yes Paul. I 'm worried.

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:39.380
I think Mr Sahai...

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.751
Ma...

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.987
I want to come home.

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:57.298
Ma, I failed.

01:19:00.902 --> 01:19:03.137
Teacher...

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:11.812
shouted at me.

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:15.182
I love you, my baby, I love you.

01:19:40.108 --> 01:19:43.010
I was told you were looking
for me Mr. Fernandez

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:45.146
Ah Mr. Sahai, please come in.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:48.749
I have been waiting for you all day...

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:54.054
I want to share my biggest
achievement with you.

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:55.723
Please have a seat.

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:06.834
Mr. Sahai, Michelle has been studying
in the same class for 2 years.

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:10.604
So I thought I would do
something to... help her.

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:17.945
First year Arts, entirely in Braille.

01:20:19.414 --> 01:20:24.919
You had once said very few chances
are given for doing good deeds.

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:30.558
I 'm happy that you haven't
wasted this chance.

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:34.028
Now no one can stop Michelle
from going ahead. Thank you.

01:20:34.029 --> 01:20:38.365
Not at all... It's my duty,
my pleasure, my pride.

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:43.871
I trust that was all right?

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.581
Is anything the matter?

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:59.453
Then the books, Mr. Sahai.
Please take them to Michelle.

01:21:05.961 --> 01:21:08.929
How do I go out?

01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:15.369
How... how do I go out?

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:17.671
I beg your pardon?

01:21:17.806 --> 01:21:20.574
The way to go out?

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:24.445
The door, Mr. Sahai...
it's right behind you.

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:26.313
Exactly the way you came in.

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:31.785
Yes...

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:38.292
Mr. Sahai, is everything all right?

01:21:57.012 --> 01:21:59.146
Tee... cher...

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.378
New feelings
were arising with age...

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:06.914
something that
I couldn't understand

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:11.185
I knew no one besides you teacher

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:16.824
That's why I thought of another
relationship with you teacher

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:19.860
Was it wrong for me
to think this way?

01:23:21.363 --> 01:23:23.097
A lot was changing...

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:27.901
But my failure was constant

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.944
Time up, Michelle... time up.

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:40.748
Michelle, you've already
had extra time.

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:44.852
Michelle... I 'll take
the paper out then.

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:49.323
- No...no....
- Please....

01:23:49.491 --> 01:23:51.558
- Leave it...
- Please......

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:59.400
Knowing the answers is not enough...
You have let me down completely.

01:23:59.534 --> 01:24:02.336
I am angry... I am very angry....

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:06.607
No... knowing the
answers is not enough...

01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:09.376
you need to put them down
on paper too, understand?

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:17.851
Don't just stand there
like a failure!

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:25.459
- It's all right.
- No. It's not all right, Mrs. McNally.

01:24:25.593 --> 01:24:27.861
It's not only her failure,
it's mine too.

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:30.664
This is the third year in a row
that she's failed.

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:32.866
For three years we have been doing
those same lessons.

01:24:33.001 --> 01:24:35.803
She's just too slow at typing.
1 0 words in 2 minutes. I mean...

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:38.906
Hey, Michelle... Michelle...

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:42.576
Where do you think you are going?
Leave this bag...

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:45.145
Leave it, leave it...
Leave this bag!

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.948
Enough! I want to go home.

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:50.217
No. No...
you're not going anywhere.

01:24:50.218 --> 01:24:51.885
I don't want to stay.
I don't want to study.

01:24:51.886 --> 01:24:56.056
No... no... You will stay...
you will study. You understand?

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:59.226
You will study. In three years even
the Braille letters have worn out...

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:03.230
- But nothing has entered your brain.
- Let her be, Mr. Sahai!

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:06.567
Mrs. McNally, I haven't spent
1 8 years of my life for this!

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:08.669
I 'm not going to allow her
to be a failure.

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:11.071
Hey... come here... you...
come here...

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:16.009
Listen, you will... you will not...
you will not run away from failure.

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:18.445
Understand?
Not run away from failure!

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:20.981
Michelle... what is this?

01:25:20.982 --> 01:25:23.784
Don't you dare disrespect a book!

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.786
Pick it up... Come on.
Pick it up., pick up the book...

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:28.822
Pick up the book... Michelle..
Michelle....

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:32.126
Pick up the book...
Stop it

01:25:43.104 --> 01:25:46.106
As long as I am alive,
you will study.

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:49.243
I don't want to learn.

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:52.079
Yes! You will learn.
You will graduate.

01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:54.748
The black robe. Our dream...

01:25:54.749 --> 01:25:55.849
I don't want a robe.

01:25:58.319 --> 01:26:00.754
My world is black

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:04.625
No. Your world...
your world is not black.

01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:06.460
It is full of light!

01:26:10.965 --> 01:26:12.633
My world is black, black, black!

01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:15.002
Black... black...

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:49.303
62 words...

01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:51.905
in less than 2 minutes.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:59.046
She's not slow anymore Mrs McNally

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:03.684
Time for celebration.

01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:09.523
Time for... an icecream, my dear

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:14.995
- lce-cream?
- Yes...

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:19.800
Mrs. McNally.
Life is an ice-cream.

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:23.737
Enjoy it before it melts.

01:27:38.853 --> 01:27:40.487
Can I have two...?

01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:45.392
Ice creams, of course...

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:53.667
Sir... ice-cream...

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:57.537
Ice-cream sir.

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:06.647
- What happened?
- Tee...

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:08.715
What's wrong with you?

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:14.321
Your change, sir.

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:17.457
Sir, your change?

01:29:21.255 --> 01:29:24.825
- Are you alright...?
- Call for a doctor!

01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:37.070
Mr. Sahai?

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:41.108
You are here...
I 've been looking for you.

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:43.944
Yes...?

01:29:44.278 --> 01:29:47.914
Don't you recognize me?
It's me... Fernandez

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:52.185
Michelle's Principal.

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:57.758
Oh... yes. of course.
I 'll get Michelle for you.

01:29:57.925 --> 01:30:01.328
- Michelle!
- Michelle can't hear, Mr. Sahai.

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:11.004
I 'll just call her.

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:17.411
- Mrs. Gomes!
- Michelle is not at home.

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:25.018
She's here.

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:44.604
To forget my name, to forget
the door... all this is fine...

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:47.741
But to forget
Michelle like this...

01:30:48.609 --> 01:30:51.077
Something is seriously wrong,
Mr. Sahai.

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:54.514
I really think you should
get some help and see a doctor...

01:30:57.785 --> 01:30:59.052
Good night. Mr. Sahai.

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:44.464
I 'm... sorry.

01:31:48.503 --> 01:31:49.769
It's ok.

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:53.340
Don't ever forget me...

01:32:00.448 --> 01:32:01.882
I promise...

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:04.684
I will never forget... you

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:09.789
You worry about me?

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:17.264
No. Don't... worry about me...

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:24.337
Just... getting old.

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:31.077
No... Don't worry.

01:32:33.814 --> 01:32:37.117
Go to... sleep.

01:32:41.155 --> 01:32:44.124
Sing you... a lullaby...

01:32:46.093 --> 01:32:47.994
No, I can't sing...

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:10.250
# Hush, my baby.
On the treetop.

01:33:12.453 --> 01:33:15.755
# When the wind blows,

01:33:16.857 --> 01:33:19.426
# the cradle will rock...

01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:23.697
# hush my baby...

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:27.934
A storm had scattered my dreams

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:31.605
All those dreams those
were most dear to me

01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:36.943
That day was the first time
I felt fear...

01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:42.482
How would I live
if you forget me?

01:33:45.252 --> 01:33:47.721
- What happened now?
- She doesn't want to come downstairs.

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:50.523
She is feeling awkward to come
in front of your in-laws.

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:52.392
She thinks she'll spoil the evening.

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:54.394
Then why did she bother
coming till here?

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:56.162
Stop it Sara..!

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:59.699
She's worried about
Mr. Sahai's health, please...

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:04.170
It really hurts me to see
the two of you fight like this....

01:34:04.405 --> 01:34:06.239
Now you get her ready
and you bring her down.

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:07.707
I have a lot of work to finish...

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:18.084
Michelle, I 'm requesting you...

01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:21.921
till now whatever you did
was special.

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:26.426
But today is a very
special day for me.

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:31.331
I 'm in love and I am getting
engaged before you.

01:34:31.465 --> 01:34:33.099
I know this could upset you.

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:36.503
Maybe this evening will
never come in your life

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:39.839
And you may be feeling that
you will never fall in love.

01:34:41.275 --> 01:34:44.244
I hope you will.
I really do...

01:34:44.378 --> 01:34:46.846
But, until then...

01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:52.686
Please don't...
spoil.my.evening. Ok?

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:06.566
I am very happy today
Because all the people

01:35:06.567 --> 01:35:08.935
I care about in the world...
Are in this room.

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:12.472
On this occasion,
I 'd love to say a few words.

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:22.615
I 'm a very lucky girl that
I got parents like you.

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:24.918
And a sister like Michelle.

01:35:25.886 --> 01:35:28.855
I haven't been the best
daughter or the best sister.

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:31.791
But I want to tell you all
I that really love you very much.

01:35:33.594 --> 01:35:35.228
And I love this house.

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:37.731
There are so many memories here.

01:35:39.333 --> 01:35:42.202
I remember one time Michelle
and I were playing outside.

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:44.904
We were running through
the grass holding hands.

01:35:45.539 --> 01:35:50.210
And while running, both of us fell
down and both of us started crying.

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:53.480
Mama and Papa
came running outside

01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:57.350
and picked up Michelle
and left me outside...

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:02.422
and there I was...
with my arms stretched out.

01:36:02.423 --> 01:36:03.323
Waiting.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:07.026
I 'm still waiting.
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

01:36:09.864 --> 01:36:14.000
As a child, l...
I used to be so angry with her

01:36:15.836 --> 01:36:19.205
The amount I loved her the
same amount I was jealous of her...

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.008
Whatever food I didn't like,
I 'd feed her.

01:36:24.645 --> 01:36:28.314
I used to wake Michelle in the
middle of the night and ask her...

01:36:28.315 --> 01:36:29.783
Do you want to drink water?

01:36:30.017 --> 01:36:32.585
Michelle used to nod her head
and say yes...

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:36.189
and I used to turn my head
and go back to sleep.

01:36:38.659 --> 01:36:40.827
She would wait for me
all night long.

01:36:45.599 --> 01:36:47.534
I can't believe I did that.

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:52.872
Can you Marc?

01:36:57.778 --> 01:37:03.616
For all those things that I did,
and all the misplaced... anger...

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:05.885
I 'd like to say I 'm sorry.

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:09.589
Did I say something wrong?

01:37:10.257 --> 01:37:12.292
- Then please let me finish.
- I don't want to listen,

01:37:12.426 --> 01:37:13.860
It's important to me. Michelle.

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:32.812
- Michelle....
- Enough!

01:37:41.722 --> 01:37:42.956
Sit down.

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:47.827
SlT... DOWN.

01:38:03.844 --> 01:38:06.312
For this joyous and
eventful evening...

01:38:08.415 --> 01:38:11.818
Michelle had prepared
a speech for Sara,

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:18.524
I would read and Michelle
would sign...

01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:24.264
But I don't think that Michelle
is in any mood for signs.

01:38:25.966 --> 01:38:32.705
It's important however, that we
should all hear what she said.

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:41.214
I was eight years old, wild, violent
always angry at life.

01:38:44.852 --> 01:38:48.521
I felt that I would never experience
the beautiful moments of life.

01:38:50.057 --> 01:38:56.930
Then mother put Sara in my arms
for the first time...

01:38:58.198 --> 01:39:00.166
I touched little eyes...

01:39:00.834 --> 01:39:02.869
And then I knew that

01:39:03.871 --> 01:39:06.205
I 'd see the world
through Sara's eyes.

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:13.780
Ma says, that I couldn't
stop smiling all day.

01:39:20.321 --> 01:39:23.589
Sara shared all her happiness
with me...

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:28.428
She would hold my hand
and take me everywhere.

01:39:28.562 --> 01:39:31.230
When Ma wasn't around
she would feed me...

01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:36.035
She would wake me at night
and ask me if I wanted water.

01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:44.577
You were the voice
to my silent fingers.

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:49.749
I am so looking forward
to your wedding day.

01:39:51.452 --> 01:39:53.286
I 'll dress up beautifully that day.

01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:05.131
I may never be the bride,
but I will still be the bridesmaid.

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:17.643
Do teach Marc how to sign,
I have lots to complain about you.

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:23.116
Thank you for allowing me
to be your bridesmaid, Sara.

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:33.326
I promise I will not cry... as you
walk with Marc towards a new life.

01:40:51.645 --> 01:40:54.213
So on this happy note...

01:40:57.518 --> 01:40:58.618
A toast....

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:04.290
For Sara and Marc

01:42:05.719 --> 01:42:09.956
Do you, Marc Philip Bragger,
take Sara Maria McNally...

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:13.759
- To be you're lawfully wedded wife?
- I do.

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:16.829
Marc... says yes.

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:23.636
- Do you, Sara Maria McNally...
- Now the priest is asking Sara...

01:42:25.005 --> 01:42:26.005
I do.

01:42:26.140 --> 01:42:28.307
Sara says... 'Yes' .

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:32.044
I declare you to be man and wife

01:42:35.215 --> 01:42:38.818
Now they are exchanging rings.

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:40.586
You may now kiss the bride.

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:46.926
The priest has asked them
to kiss as man and wife.

01:42:50.764 --> 01:42:51.697
On the cheek?

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:54.534
No, no, not on the cheek.
On the lips.

01:43:46.353 --> 01:43:47.587
Tee...

01:44:08.242 --> 01:44:11.244
What are you doing here?

01:44:12.946 --> 01:44:15.514
Wanted... to talk.

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:36.135
Do you love... me?

01:44:46.613 --> 01:44:49.515
I 'm suffering...

01:44:54.855 --> 01:45:00.126
I understand
that you are suffering...

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:06.399
I may never know...

01:45:06.533 --> 01:45:10.970
What it is to... love... a man

01:45:15.542 --> 01:45:26.952
Maybe you will never
experience physical love

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:34.427
But...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

01:45:40.901 --> 01:45:45.871
Will you kiss me once...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

01:45:50.744 --> 01:45:51.944
Please?
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

01:47:29.943 --> 01:47:31.143
Tee...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

01:47:36.516 --> 01:47:37.750
Teee...
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>

01:47:38.618 --> 01:47:42.121
In giving me dignity
as a woman...

01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:46.292
You lost all dignity
as a teacher.

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:50.362
I realized that
I had asked too much.

01:47:50.697 --> 01:47:51.931
I made a mistake.

01:47:52.899 --> 01:47:55.634
You didn't even give me a chance
to ask for your forgiveness.

01:47:56.803 --> 01:47:58.237
I'm leaving

01:47:59.473 --> 01:48:04.643
Like your walking-stick,
never forget one thing

01:48:05.545 --> 01:48:11.350
Darkness is desperately trying
to engulf you

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:14.887
But you must always
walk towards light

01:48:15.856 --> 01:48:18.457
Every step of yours,
filled with hope,

01:48:18.458 --> 01:48:20.526
Will keep me alive, Michelle

01:48:34.708 --> 01:48:37.309
Once again light transcended
into darkness...

01:48:38.678 --> 01:48:41.247
and sound into silence.

01:48:41.781 --> 01:48:45.351
For twelve years

01:48:45.519 --> 01:48:47.486
I walked the path you showed me...

01:48:48.455 --> 01:48:50.923
Alone in the darkness.

01:48:52.726 --> 01:48:57.496
When after twelve years I had
found you near the same fountain...

01:48:57.831 --> 01:49:01.166
and today after 1 2 days
this mark sheet.

01:49:01.301 --> 01:49:04.169
I'm now a graduate in the arts.

01:49:05.038 --> 01:49:08.007
I want you to be the first one
to hear the good news

01:49:08.842 --> 01:49:12.378
Mr. Sahai this is your bed,
please lie down.

01:49:12.546 --> 01:49:15.714
Please... that's it

01:49:15.882 --> 01:49:20.085
Mr. Sahai...
This is your bed, Mr. Sahai!

01:49:20.253 --> 01:49:21.453
Nurse!

01:49:22.322 --> 01:49:23.556
Mr.Sahai...

01:49:24.958 --> 01:49:28.027
Please lie down... Mr. Sahai

01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:48.213
Tee...

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:08.167
Teee!

01:50:08.635 --> 01:50:09.835
Tee...

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:14.506
Tee...!

01:50:52.178 --> 01:50:54.980
Amidst us today there
is a student...

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:58.183
who has set an example
of grit and strength...

01:50:58.985 --> 01:51:04.056
And has proved that
nothing is impossible.

01:51:05.158 --> 01:51:08.193
She is the pride of our university.

01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:12.331
And on this rare achievement,
I would want her to say a few words.

01:51:12.465 --> 01:51:15.567
Ladies and Gentleman,
Michelle McNally

01:51:22.442 --> 01:51:24.376
That's my daughter.

01:51:41.461 --> 01:51:43.395
After many attempts...

01:51:43.963 --> 01:51:47.666
The spider, in spite of
falling several times...

01:51:48.134 --> 01:51:50.069
Has finally made her home.

01:51:51.571 --> 01:51:53.706
The ant has climbed her mountain.

01:51:54.708 --> 01:51:57.543
A tortoise has crossed the dessert...

01:51:58.411 --> 01:52:01.747
And today Michelle McNally,
has finally become a graduate.

01:52:07.253 --> 01:52:09.888
But there is a difference
between you and me.

01:52:10.056 --> 01:52:15.027
What took you 20 years
has taken me 40.

01:52:15.895 --> 01:52:17.529
But I finally did it!

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:31.043
As a child, I always
lagged behind others.

01:52:33.847 --> 01:52:38.417
My parents were
always ashamed of me.

01:52:39.719 --> 01:52:44.256
Every year I would call home
and say, 'Ma, I failed.'

01:52:47.026 --> 01:52:48.794
But today I can say...

01:52:48.795 --> 01:52:50.429
Ma, I passed.

01:52:59.005 --> 01:53:03.709
I know that my parents
are very proud of me.

01:53:04.577 --> 01:53:08.480
Telling the world proudly that
I am their daughter

01:53:09.015 --> 01:53:11.183
Thank you Mama, Papa...

01:53:20.326 --> 01:53:24.863
As a child, I was always
searching for something.

01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:33.105
But in the end,
I would only find darkness

01:53:34.607 --> 01:53:41.513
One day, my mother put me
in those unknown arms.

01:53:42.916 --> 01:53:46.518
He was different from every one.
He was a magician.

01:53:47.086 --> 01:53:53.926
For years he dragged me from
darkness into the light.

01:53:57.330 --> 01:54:00.165
When it comes to God,
we are all blind.

01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:04.336
None of you have ever
seen Him or heard Him.

01:54:05.405 --> 01:54:11.410
But I have touched God.
I have felt his presence.

01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:16.582
I call him 'Tee' .

01:54:24.791 --> 01:54:26.692
For me everything was BLACK

01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:35.133
But my teacher taught me
the new meaning of Black

01:54:39.672 --> 01:54:43.375
Black is not only darkness
and suffocation.

01:54:46.779 --> 01:54:51.483
It is the colour of achievement.
The colour of knowledge.

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:56.154
The colour of the graduation robe.

01:54:56.923 --> 01:54:59.191
The colour that we all share today.

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:03.462
But there is a difference
between you and me.

01:55:03.463 --> 01:55:07.332
Today you all wear this
to celebrate graduation.

01:55:07.333 --> 01:55:08.767
But not me.

01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:15.641
Because I want my teacher
to be the first one to see me...

01:55:15.775 --> 01:55:18.143
Wear this black robe.

01:55:25.952 --> 01:55:30.088
Every graduation day,
he brought me here.

01:55:30.757 --> 01:55:34.259
Every year, we would stand
near that door...

01:55:34.294 --> 01:55:37.496
and every year he would
write in my hand...

01:55:38.097 --> 01:55:42.301
One day I want to see you
on that stage Michelle

01:55:45.705 --> 01:55:49.741
It has taken me 40 years...
to fulfill his dream.

01:55:50.176 --> 01:55:55.347
And today, for the first time,
I feel my lack of sight.

01:55:55.481 --> 01:55:59.618
Because I want to see my teacher
standing at the door...

01:56:00.186 --> 01:56:06.191
Watching me fulfill our dream
with pride

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:32.818
Teacher...

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:34.039
Our dream

01:59:33.499 --> 01:59:49.347
Woah...

01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:00.825
- Woah...
- Woah...

02:00:23.649 --> 02:00:25.283
Dear Ms. Nair,

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:29.988
You'll be happy to know that
we have come into the light:

02:00:31.891 --> 02:00:36.528
Today my teacher has remembered
his first word - Water.

02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:42.434
He is the greatest teacher
in the world...

02:00:42.602 --> 02:00:44.736
Who has proved again that

02:00:45.404 --> 02:00:47.839
There is nothing impossible
in this world.

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:50.575
Who has taught me that there
is so much happiness in living for someone else

02:00:51.377 --> 02:00:54.779
Today is my teacher's
first day at school Miss Nair.

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:57.816
And his alphabets,
just like mine,

02:00:57.850 --> 02:01:00.151
will not start with
A, B, C, D, and E.

02:01:00.486 --> 02:01:06.291
But with B, L, A, C, K

02:01:07.059 --> 02:01:08.260
BLACK
<font face="Palatino Linotype" color="#00ff00"><b>Encoded By CharmeLeon</b></font>
