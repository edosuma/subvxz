00:06.548 --> 00:08.425
[television clicks on]

00:08.508 --> 00:10.719
[announcer]  The following is a paid
advertisement from Guy Bilzerian.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.554
It is not approved
by the New York Bar Association.

00:12.637 --> 00:16.016
I'm Guy Bilzerian,
attorney at law and family man.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.184
But I will happily abandon my family

00:18.268 --> 00:20.854
to get you the divorce settlement
you  deserve.

00:20.937 --> 00:24.274
You might know me from my bench ads,
my three delinquent sons,

00:24.357 --> 00:26.651
or my twice-institutionalized wife.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.404
But I want you to know me
as your first line of defense

00:29.487 --> 00:32.365
against bitch ex-wives
and asshole ex-husbands,

00:32.449 --> 00:34.659
'cause I play both sides of the coin.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.828
It's the law, not magic,

00:36.911 --> 00:41.082
and anyone who does magic
is a disappointment to his father.

00:41.166 --> 00:45.170
Call me today, because marriage is a sham
and love dies.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.796
Let's bury the body together.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.340
- Jay, keep rolling.
- [Jay] Dad-- oh, shit!

01:24.083 --> 01:27.337
We know you threw a party while we were
at your father's cardiology conference.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.506
We have half a mind
not to give you these T-shirts.

01:29.589 --> 01:30.799
It was just a few people.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.592
Jud, Leah, you're grounded
for three weeks.

01:32.675 --> 01:36.805
- Three weeks? That's ridiculous.
- Make it four. I'm writing my manifesto.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.557
- What a work ethic on this kid.
- Wait, do I not get punished?

01:39.641 --> 01:43.478
Aww. Nicky, you're
my sweet little pumpkin.

01:43.561 --> 01:46.064
- You're not responsible.
- Mom, I'm not a pumpkin.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.233
- Well, you're my baby--
- I'm not a baby.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.193
Besides, you can't be grounded.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.237
You need to dance with me
at Jessi's bat mitzvah.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.905
And save a dance for me, too.

01:53.988 --> 01:56.407
Did you know that if you raise the roof,
when they do that,

01:56.491 --> 01:58.868
then you can lower your arms
and it's hugging arms.

01:58.952 --> 01:59.786
[groans]

02:00.411 --> 02:02.705
Kids, I'm sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

02:02.789 --> 02:05.792
but we've all discussed it,
and the parents agree

02:05.875 --> 02:07.877
that neither of you are ready
to be in a relationship.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.838
- What?
- But we  are  ready!

02:09.921 --> 02:11.256
We just won't lie to you anymore.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.675
And what about the mons pushing?

02:13.758 --> 02:15.802
- What the hell's a mons?
- Oh, we don't need--

02:15.885 --> 02:19.472
A mons push is a preamble
to sexual intercourse.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.850
- Mom!
- Oh, God, our son is a deviant.

02:21.933 --> 02:25.145
What'd you do to her, you pervert?
Corrupting this little girl.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.605
Look at her, she's a child.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.357
But she's six months older than me.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.192
Know what they do to pedophiles
in the big house?

02:31.276 --> 02:33.194
- Okay...
- Shank 'em in the shower

02:33.278 --> 02:35.822
and turn their pee into wine.
That's what they do.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.408
We just think the kids
need to stop seeing each other.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.327
- Missy, let's go.
- I'm sorry.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.830
- Goodbye, Andrew.
- Goodbye, Missy.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.583
No! Missy!

02:46.666 --> 02:50.253
Why don't you go outside, push that mons
of yours against the lawnmower?

02:50.336 --> 02:53.590
- It's nighttime.
- Isn't that when you perverts go out?

02:54.173 --> 02:57.844
I finally agree to let your dumbass
friends play Jessi's bat mitzvah

02:57.927 --> 03:00.722
- and they back out at the last minute?
- Chill, Shannon.

03:00.805 --> 03:03.141
You know what makes a woman
not want to chill, Greg?

03:03.224 --> 03:05.059
Having a man tell her to chill.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.811
I can't believe my mom.

03:06.895 --> 03:10.481
She kisses some lady on the street,
now she's being mean to Dad?

03:10.565 --> 03:14.235
That is fucked up, but who is the lady?

03:14.319 --> 03:16.946
I don't know.
I never even thought about that.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.865
The party is tomorrow!

03:18.948 --> 03:20.450
We all know that, everyone knows that!

03:20.533 --> 03:23.786
- Guys, stop yelling.
- Honey, we're not yelling. [chuckles]

03:23.870 --> 03:27.665
We're discussing the logistics
for the best day of your life.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.667
Best day of your life? Hah!

03:29.751 --> 03:31.377
Your parents keep fighting,

03:31.461 --> 03:34.464
you got a big ol' pimple
percolatin' on your forehead,

03:34.547 --> 03:37.759
and crooked Shannon forced you
to buy that dress

03:37.842 --> 03:40.678
- that makes your torso look boxy.
- You don't like the dress?

03:40.762 --> 03:43.723
It doesn't work! It never worked!

03:43.806 --> 03:47.185
I hate my life, and I hate my dress!

03:47.268 --> 03:48.645
The dress looks great.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.606
Just take a deep breath and relax.

03:51.689 --> 03:54.776
You know what makes a person
not want to relax, Shannon?

03:54.859 --> 03:57.320
- Nice turn.
- Shut up, Dad!

03:57.403 --> 03:59.864
Burn the house to the ground!

03:59.948 --> 04:02.825
Use the boxy dress as kindling.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.828
It's so annoying.
She treats me like I'm a little kid.

04:05.912 --> 04:10.041
You  are  a little kid.
I saw your dick, remember? [laughs]

04:10.124 --> 04:14.087
- You guys could be prosecuted for that.
- Where, in ghost court?

04:14.170 --> 04:18.091
Hey!  Ghost Court,  that's a good idea
for a TV show!

04:18.174 --> 04:21.552
Nick, you got to contact my agent,
Jew Fishman.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.304
He'll work out the details.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.555
- [laughs]
- [knock on door]

04:25.515 --> 04:28.309
Hi, sweetie.
Just wanted to say good night.

04:28.935 --> 04:32.105
Actually, I don't really feel comfortable
kissing you on the lips anymore.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.356
Is that okay?

04:33.439 --> 04:36.025
Okay, sure. Yeah, of course.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.529
Um, how about I just tuck you in,
kiddo, okay, and I'll be on my way?

04:39.612 --> 04:42.824
You know, I actually think I got it.
Just gotta pull the blanket up a bit.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.659
Okay, great, fantastic.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.703
- So... good night, Nicky.
- Nick.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.205
I think I'd like you
to call me Nick from now on.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.123
Okay, Nick.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.457
- Good night, Diane.
- Watch it.

04:52.959 --> 04:53.876
[muffled sob]

04:53.960 --> 04:57.297
What the hell did you just do
to your mama?

04:57.380 --> 04:58.381
I'm setting some boundaries.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.800
That woman loves you unconditionally.

05:00.883 --> 05:04.804
When you were a baby, she made you
personalized tittie cocktails.

05:04.887 --> 05:06.264
Are you talking about breast feeding?

05:06.347 --> 05:08.850
Yecch! It's gross when you say it.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.936
I'm getting older,
and I don't want to be babied anymore.

05:12.020 --> 05:16.149
I drank my mommy's boobie juice
till I was 12 years old.

05:16.232 --> 05:21.487
♪ And no woman ever measured up
To the love of my life ♪

05:21.571 --> 05:23.614
♪ My mommy ♪

05:23.698 --> 05:25.158
Huge breasts!

- [sobbing]

05:26.701 --> 05:28.077
What's wrong, my love?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.413
I feel like Nicky just broke up with me.

05:30.496 --> 05:34.375
He doesn't want me to tuck him in anymore,
doesn't even want me to call him Nicky.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.962
[sighs] Diane, we have to let
our baby bird leave the nest.

05:38.046 --> 05:41.007
I know, but-- but when he's gone,

05:41.090 --> 05:43.801
there will be no more babies
to take care of.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.679
You can take care of me.
You want me to dress up like a baby?

05:46.763 --> 05:48.848
You're such a weird perv sometimes.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.601
Aww, you remember our vows, Mommy.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.978
[crying]

05:54.937 --> 05:55.855
[horn honks]

05:55.938 --> 05:59.233
Oh, please, if you're so handicapped
maybe you shouldn't be driving!

05:59.317 --> 06:00.485
[groans]

06:01.069 --> 06:04.572
We are so square. We look like
a couple of Fig Newtons.

06:04.655 --> 06:05.656
[knock on door]

06:05.740 --> 06:07.241
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey, Cantor Dina.

06:07.325 --> 06:10.953
Wow! Really good vibes in this room. Yes!

06:11.037 --> 06:13.956
FYI, we're gonna begin the journey
in five minutes.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.209
- Okay.
- Or as we say in the theater,

06:16.292 --> 06:18.836
- "Thank you, five."
- Okay.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.713
You have to say it back to me.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.341
- Thank you, five?
- Shalom.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.551
- Found you!
- [groans]

06:25.635 --> 06:26.886
No. Why?

06:26.969 --> 06:29.972
Listen, I know I'm not supposed to see
the bat before the mitzvah,

06:30.056 --> 06:31.933
but ta-da-- oww!

06:32.016 --> 06:33.851
Jesus, fuck!

06:33.935 --> 06:37.355
- [groans] Please don't give me flowers.
- What? I can't help it.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.856
I mean, look at you.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.276
You're like a square, sexy box.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.863
I just want to, like, take you to FedEx
and fill you full of packing peanuts.

06:45.947 --> 06:49.826
Stop! I hate this dress.
My stupid mother made me get it.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.702
Oh, yeah, moms are so stupid.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.538
They're always passing out drunk
in the bath

06:53.621 --> 06:55.915
instead of signing
your field trip permission slip.

06:55.998 --> 06:58.334
Oh, Jay, that is real bleak.

06:58.417 --> 07:01.420
Look, could we just cool it
with the romantic gestures, okay?

07:01.504 --> 07:04.757
As you wish, my boxy Jewess.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.469
Wha-- aah! Oh!

07:08.553 --> 07:11.931
- Andrew, what are you doing?
- I missed you, Missy.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.599
Yeah, I missed you, too.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.977
Our parents are being crazy, right?

07:16.060 --> 07:18.813
You want to be with me,
and I want to be with you.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.982
What if we... What if we dated in secret?

07:21.065 --> 07:24.235
Ohh. You mean like Fatima and Gustavo?

07:24.318 --> 07:26.529
Yes, except, of course,
I won't be a horse.

07:26.612 --> 07:29.323
Yeah, but you're hung like one.
Reveal your meat.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.118
Wowzie-wow, forbidden lovers?

07:32.201 --> 07:35.872
I can tell that I'm genuinely excited
because my back is really sweaty.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.375
- Oh. Shall I dab it with my tallit?
- [chuckles]

07:39.459 --> 07:40.960
Is that kosher?

07:41.043 --> 07:45.131
I don't know, but I feel like
we're breaking all the rules today.

07:45.214 --> 07:46.174
Ooh...

07:46.257 --> 07:50.052
[Marty] Andrew, where are you? I'm done
fighting over the handicapped spot.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.473
- I'll find you later, Fatima.
- [muffled scream]

Sorry, a lot of feelings. Ooh!

♪ We gather all together ♪

07:59.812 --> 08:04.400
♪ The mothers and the fathers ♪
Uh-huh.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.069
Hey, that singing rabbi up there,
does she look familiar?

08:07.153 --> 08:10.448
That's the cantor.
She just does the "music."

08:10.531 --> 08:13.826
- That's a whole job?
- Exactly. It's a scam!

08:13.910 --> 08:18.080
- Like soap. Soap is lard.
- Marty, be quiet!

08:18.164 --> 08:22.335
Ooh, I spoke to Greg. There will be
no scallops at this bat mitzvah.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.921
Thank goodness. Last time,
we had to throw away your suit.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.507
And my shoes. Don't forget my shoes.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.342
They were like the spill tray.

08:30.009 --> 08:33.054
Hey, does this church serve
those, uh, wafers?

08:33.137 --> 08:35.848
- I didn't eat breakfast.
- Oh, you poor starving thing.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.892
Let me see
what I've got in my purse here.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.561
- Aw, thanks, Mrs. Birch.
- Here. Call me Diane.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.605
Okay, Mommy.
[snarling and munching]

08:43.856 --> 08:46.275
Psst! Hey, let's sneak off with Missy

08:46.359 --> 08:49.529
while your dad is scratching
what appears to be a troll's foot.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.240
- Hmm...
- [gasps]

08:53.199 --> 08:54.825
So I'm Cantor Dina Reznick,

08:54.909 --> 08:59.580
and I have had the distinct honor
of being Jessi's guide.

08:59.664 --> 09:03.376
I don't know what it is,
but I do not like that woman.

09:03.459 --> 09:06.420
And it's been a real  simcha,
right, Jess?

09:06.504 --> 09:10.258
She's the worst.
I hate how she "huchs" her words.

09:10.341 --> 09:12.635
She should shut the fucch up.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.387
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:14.470 --> 09:17.682
- I can't believe we're alone.
- We can do whatever we want.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.684
Do you boys need a yarmulke?

09:19.767 --> 09:21.185
No, thank you, Mr. Fishman.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.729
Come on, it's too dangerous out here.
Come with me.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.982
Yeah, I'll take a yarmulke,
for my Jewish penis.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.025
Thank you!

09:28.109 --> 09:30.236
I use it to cover my bald spot.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.281
And now, for the first  aliyah,

09:33.364 --> 09:36.409
I'd like to invite up
Jessi's beautiful mother Shannon

09:36.492 --> 09:37.827
and her husband Greg.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.914
[kissing and moaning]

09:41.998 --> 09:45.293
Oh, uh... don't worry,
I won't mons push you this time.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.878
You can mons push me all you want.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.005
[chuckling]

09:49.088 --> 09:51.882
- Look at her pawing at your mama.
- Seriously.

09:51.966 --> 09:54.385
That's a very long hug.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.013
[kissing]

09:57.763 --> 09:59.974
Andrew, isn't that your jazz hat?

10:00.057 --> 10:00.975
Huh.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.936
[Nick]  That's Jessi's mom.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.563
Oh, God.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.523
Oh, my God.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.276
It's her.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.111
Jessi... Jessi...

10:12.194 --> 10:13.404
- Jessi.
- Huh?

10:13.487 --> 10:15.656
So it's time for you
to read your Torah portion.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.866
I... I...

10:16.949 --> 10:19.285
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

10:19.368 --> 10:23.456
You are a woman now,
and this is what women do.

10:23.539 --> 10:27.960
We suck up all the bullshit
that the world dumps up on us

10:28.044 --> 10:31.797
and keep smiling through it all
in our boxy-ass dresses!

10:31.881 --> 10:34.216
Amen.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.137
Jessi, I loved it.
A few small thoughts--

10:38.220 --> 10:41.474
You sang great.
The breath in here is-- it's terrible.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.976
Jessi, mazel tov.
I have to tell you something.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.770
That cantor lady, she--

10:45.853 --> 10:47.938
She's the woman you saw
kissing my mom, isn't she?

10:48.022 --> 10:49.732
Holy shit, she is!

10:49.815 --> 10:52.151
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

10:52.234 --> 10:55.196
Barbara, I lost a sock in the pews again.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.531
[airhorn sample blaring]

10:57.615 --> 11:00.284
DJ Pendejo coming at you!

11:00.368 --> 11:03.162
If you have any music requests,
come talk to me.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.747
Do not write them down.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.751
And make sure I can see your lips
because I am losing my hearing.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.420
This  is how you handled it, Greg?

11:11.504 --> 11:13.839
Give me a break.
He said he'd do it for free.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.716
Oh, I don't get paid by the school either.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.804
I'm what's known in the business world
as, uh, a volunteer person.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.139
Who the hell is Malala?

11:22.223 --> 11:24.350
She's just this girl
who got shot in the face

11:24.433 --> 11:26.352
'cause she read a book
and now she's super famous.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.979
- Lucky Malala.
- That's what they call her.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.900
Diane, I got you a glass of Pinot gris
with two ice cubes,

11:32.983 --> 11:35.778
- just the way you like it.
- Wow. Thank you, Jay.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.780
That is so sweet.

11:37.863 --> 11:39.615
Jay, why are you bringing my mom drinks?

11:39.698 --> 11:41.867
Because she rocks. Not that you care.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.870
I watch how you treat her with all
the cameras I hid all over your house.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.998
- It's fucked up, bro.
- Just stay away from her, okay?

11:48.082 --> 11:51.085
And for the last time, get rid
of the cameras in my house.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.546
Whatever, man.
At the end of the night,

11:53.629 --> 11:56.090
we'll see who's seeing who get tucked in.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.716
- Please.
- He's right.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.302
You don't appreciate your mama.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.304
Do you boys need a yarmulke?

12:02.388 --> 12:05.808
Well, I'll be! It's Jew Fishman, my agent.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.394
Jew, I want to pitch a show
to Merv Griffin.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.646
It's called  Ghost Court.
I could be the judge.

12:10.729 --> 12:14.400
- Do you boys need a yarmulke?
- Jew's gone senile.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.486
Jew, can you even remember the name
of my first single?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.655
Do you boys need a yarmulke?

12:19.738 --> 12:23.909
Oh, good, he still remembers
some things. [chuckles]

12:25.661 --> 12:26.996
Scallops, sir?

12:27.079 --> 12:28.998
Scallops, what are you doing here?

12:29.081 --> 12:32.668
- Would you like one?
- Oh. That's a very complicated question.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.421
Marty. It's us, Marty.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.090
- Have a taste.
- You know you love our texture.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.800
Stop that, please, all of you.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.803
I'm married, for chrissakes,
and these are new shoes.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.763
- Rockports...
- 9 1/2...

12:44.847 --> 12:48.017
- Extra wide.
- Ooh, that's right.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.604
Enough to keep eight packs of Rolaids in.
You know me so well.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.940
Hey, why don't you meet us
at the dumpster after cocktail hour?

12:55.024 --> 12:57.193
- You won't regret it.
- Ohh...

12:57.276 --> 13:01.947
All right, round up the Jews
and make 'em walk in a line.

13:02.031 --> 13:06.076
Choo-choo! Get on the train, Jews,
it's time to dance!

13:06.160 --> 13:08.662
- [ Hava Nagila  playing]
- You can't hide from the party police.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.707
That's right. I'm looking at you,
Anne Frank table.

13:11.790 --> 13:15.461
Why am I oddly offended
we're not being rounded up as well?

13:15.544 --> 13:16.962
I'm just here for the open bar.

13:17.922 --> 13:21.050
This is great. Everyone thinks
we're just holding hands

13:21.133 --> 13:23.719
when, really, we're holding hands.

13:23.802 --> 13:27.723
- I never wanna let go of you.
- Never's a really long time.

13:27.806 --> 13:30.976
- Not when I'm with you.
- Oh, I'm getting dizzy.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.645
It's moving really fast, right?

13:32.728 --> 13:35.648
It's a magical night.
Don't you agree, Connie?

13:35.731 --> 13:38.400
Not now, Maury. I've got my hands full.

13:39.151 --> 13:43.822
Look at her, flaunting her indiscretions
like a pair of diamond earrings.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.282
[laughing]

13:45.366 --> 13:47.451
Oh, I'm having so much fun!

13:47.535 --> 13:49.286
Oh. That's nice, sweetie.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.747
Everyone keeps saying
how much we look alike.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.582
Mom, stop it, you're embarrassing me.

13:53.666 --> 13:57.127
Nicky, it's the  horah.
Everybody's dancing.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.547
- You can join us if you like.
- I don't want to dance.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.299
Well, then you don't have to.
Come on, honey.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.554
Spoiler alert: it's time
to get Jessi on the chair

14:06.637 --> 14:08.472
for the Jewish push-'em-up.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.307
Wait, wait, no, please don't.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.143
Aah!

14:14.436 --> 14:15.479
Aaah!

14:16.188 --> 14:18.607
- Huh?
- Open up, jellybean.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.277
- Babe.
- Oh, come on.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.196
Jessi, your parents
are very much in love.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.781
You'll just have to get used to that.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.199
Aaah!

14:27.283 --> 14:30.202
Oh, babe, I was gonna watch
a Sublime documentary tonight.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.956
It's just one client dinner, two hours,
and can you not...?

14:34.039 --> 14:37.543
You got it. I'll just practice "Santeria"
some other time, then.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.506
- My dad was a lemon.
- My dad was a purple.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.216
Actually, your dad  is  a lemon.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.801
- Okay, Shannon.
- Okay, Greg.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.889
- [cheers and laughter]
- Put me down. Please put me down!

in the photo booth.

- I feel like I can't breathe.
- I know, me too.

15:02.484 --> 15:05.738
No, really, I feel like maybe
we should go back to the people.

15:05.821 --> 15:08.365
I'm seeing sparkles,
and my stomach is all swirly.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.742
It-- it's so exciting.

15:09.825 --> 15:12.995
I can already picture us
getting married and having children

15:13.078 --> 15:15.998
and then they'll get married--
well, not to each other, to other people.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.541
- Oh, life.
- Oh, Lordy.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.170
The thing I'm trying to say is I...
I love you.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.131
- What?
- [distorted] I love you...

[camera shutter whirring]

15:31.347 --> 15:34.558

with Jessi's bubbie on the dance floor.

in a five pound bag.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.563
- What'd I miss?
- I told her I loved her.

Jessi's bubbie?
'Cause get in line, Larry.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.610
No, I told Missy I loved her.

15:44.693 --> 15:46.528
- Why?
- Because I do.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.864
Who the fuck cares?
It's way too soon.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.700
You might be right. [sobs] She barfed.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.245
You idiot! She's a delicate orchid
who needs to be gently misted,

15:55.329 --> 15:58.749
and you unleashed a fire hose
of Monster Energy drink on her.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.960
Which is great for people
but not for orchids.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.503
Take it from  this  monster.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.047
Are you trying to get sponsored
by Monster Energy drink?

16:05.130 --> 16:07.800
- Stay focused, Andrew. You fucked up.
- I know that.

16:07.883 --> 16:11.387
Monster Energy,
brings out the monster in you.

16:11.470 --> 16:15.349
Brings  out  the monster... Uh...
Let me just try this one more time here.

16:15.432 --> 16:18.352
Brings out the monster in  you !
Yeah, nailed it.

16:18.435 --> 16:20.020
Get my agent. Where's Jew Fishman?

16:23.148 --> 16:24.483
Mmm...

16:24.566 --> 16:27.653
- What are you doing out here?
- Nothing. I'm doing nothing.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.363
You know I love you, right, Barbara?

16:29.446 --> 16:31.490
Love me? Ugh! Marty, don't be weird.

E is for everyone,
the people who love Jessi.

S is for slut.
It's what everyone says Jessi is.

- Lola!
- What?

16:46.880 --> 16:48.590
[chuckling]

16:49.383 --> 16:51.385
She's rubbing our faces in it,

16:51.468 --> 16:54.596
just like she rubbed her face
in Cantor Dina's--

16:54.680 --> 16:59.435
- Okay, okay.
- What? I was gonna say mons pubis.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.645
Mom, I need to talk to you.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.188
- What's wrong, Jessi Bear?
- Now.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.609
- I know everything!
- What? What do you mean?

17:07.693 --> 17:10.696
I know you're cheating on Daddy
with Cantor Dina.

17:10.779 --> 17:14.283
Okay, Jessi,
let's just take a deep breath.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.202
This whole time, you guys have been...?

17:17.828 --> 17:19.872
What are you? You're, like, a lesbian now?

17:21.206 --> 17:22.791
[stammers]

17:22.875 --> 17:25.669
I don't know.
I'm still figuring things out.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.463
But what about you and Daddy?

17:27.546 --> 17:30.674
Your father and I have been struggling
for a long time.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.343
Do you even... [sighs]
do you even love him anymore?

17:33.427 --> 17:34.803
I don't know.

17:34.887 --> 17:38.057
[coughing] Whoa.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.559
That's heavy.

17:40.642 --> 17:44.563
Now I can see the family's having
a particularly tense moment,

17:44.646 --> 17:49.151
so it's the perfect time
for a speech from Mom and Dad!

17:50.402 --> 17:51.820
- [clears throat]
- [mic feedback]

17:51.904 --> 17:54.656
Jessi, you were so amazing today.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.242
You really did Eleanor Roosevelt proud.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.410
She did, didn't she?

17:58.494 --> 18:00.412
Shannon, can I see the mic
for a second?

18:00.496 --> 18:04.333
- Greg, we agreed I would speak.
- Oh, we agreed on a lot of stuff.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.335
- Gimme, gimme! Just gimme.
- [soft feedback squeal]

18:06.418 --> 18:09.463
- Don't worry, Daddy, I got two mics.
- Oh, Jesus.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.841
Jesus? Not in this house of worship.
Am I right?

18:12.925 --> 18:16.595

I-- I don't know the different ones.

You've grown up so fast.

It's like one of those Internet videos
where they take a picture every day.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.191
A different picture every day,
you show them together real fast,

18:29.274 --> 18:31.777
it looks like the guy, like,
grows a beard right in front of you.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.196
- Greg.
- I remember when we brought you home.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.448
We were so happy.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.242
But things are so different now.

18:38.325 --> 18:40.994
I mean, not necessarily worse, but, uh...

18:41.078 --> 18:42.538
What are we talking about?
Yeah, they're worse.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.665
[nervous chuckle] Right, Shannon?
You made it worse.

18:44.748 --> 18:47.376
- Greg, please give me the mic.
- It's my turn to talk.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.837
- Chill, Greg.
- Don't tell my dad to chill.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.090
Yeah, shove it up your cantor ass,
Cantor Dina.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.050
Greg, that is uncalled for.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.678
Can everyone please
stop saying my name like that,

18:57.761 --> 19:01.306
- like-- like I'm some kind of maniac?
- Then stop acting like one, Greg!

- You only get one mother.
- Jew Fishman?

20:42.407 --> 20:45.786
The bad news is Jew passed away
during the  horah.

20:45.869 --> 20:48.580
The good news is
Ghost Court  is back on!

20:48.664 --> 20:50.916
We're gonna get Duke points
on the back end.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.668
I'm happy for you guys. I'm...

20:52.751 --> 20:54.419
I'm gonna go talk to my mom.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.005
Jay, I need a minute with my mom.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.841
- Is this guy bothering you, Diane?
- Not at all. This guy's my son.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.719
That's right, and she's my mom.
I'm really lucky to have her.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.972
She's a good mom. Take care of her, okay?

21:05.055 --> 21:07.182
Okay, Jay, just get lost.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.559
Mom, will you please dance with me?

21:09.643 --> 21:11.812
- I would love to, Nick.
- You can call me Nicky.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.855
- Okay, Nicky.
- All right, Diane.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.024
Seriously, cut that shit out.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.278
- What about me?
- Come here, son.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.863
- I'll be your mom.
- This is nice.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.033
You're wrong, Jay. It's dynamite.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.417
- Ooh!
- We knew you'd come.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.128
Why don't you slip us inside you?

21:37.754 --> 21:39.881
Oh, my God! What am I doing?

21:39.965 --> 21:41.550
I'm an angrily married man.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.635
- Marty.
- You know you want us.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.096
Damn it! There comes a time
in every man's life

21:46.179 --> 21:49.850
when he must choose between his wife
and guaranteed automatic diarrhea.

21:49.933 --> 21:53.061
- It'll be our secret.
- No one has to know.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.189
I  would know, and so would my wife.

21:56.273 --> 21:59.443
Because of the relentless fecal explosion.

21:59.526 --> 22:03.655
- [grunts]
- [sobbing] Marty, what are you doing?

22:03.739 --> 22:06.658
What? You've never seen
a hormone monster's Jewish penis

22:06.742 --> 22:08.285
eat dumpster scallops?

22:08.368 --> 22:09.578
Get a life.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.955
Give me Malala!

22:12.039 --> 22:15.000
I will kick you in the pussy,
you stupid shit.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.044
At least I still have a pussy.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.421
Maury, we need to talk.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.506
Oh, shit. This is bad.

22:21.590 --> 22:23.717
- Hi, Andrew.
- Hi, Missy.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.636
Listen, um, about what I said
in the photo booth,

22:26.720 --> 22:28.180
let's just pretend it didn't happen.

22:28.263 --> 22:31.183
Oh, but it did. We need to face it.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.351
Andrew, you're like sugar to me.

22:33.435 --> 22:36.354
I like you, but every time I have you,
I lose control,

22:36.438 --> 22:38.899
and I-- I hate to say it,
but I end up regretting it.

22:38.982 --> 22:41.068
- But, Missy--
- My parents were right.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.528
We need to break up. For real this time.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.197
No, don't say that. We can fix this.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.449
- Connie, please?
- I lost her, Maury.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.367
For, at least, the next few years.

22:49.451 --> 22:52.662
She came in hot, but burned out bright.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.582
Missy, come on, I don't need to be sugar.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.084
I can be raisins.

22:57.167 --> 23:01.588
Oh, Andrew. Raisins are chock-full
of natural sugar.

23:01.671 --> 23:04.007
I'm sorry, there's no way around it.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.093
You're just too sweet for me.

23:07.010 --> 23:10.555
With all due respect, Connie,
this girl's a little fucking cunt.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.808
And me and the boy
are gonna kill ourselves tonight.

23:12.891 --> 23:16.019
Yeah, I get it. You do you, Maury.
You gotta do you.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.230
Well, Steve, you did it.

23:18.313 --> 23:19.689
I really did, didn't I?

23:19.773 --> 23:23.151
You played the wrong music,
constantly referenced the Holocaust,

23:23.235 --> 23:25.529
and you appear to have killed an old man.

23:25.612 --> 23:26.655
Congratulations.

23:26.738 --> 23:29.407
Thanks, Matthew.
That really means the world.

23:29.491 --> 23:33.036
I truly envy your ability to bat away
every one of my insults.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.830
Right back at you, my dude.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.332
[sighs]

23:38.083 --> 23:40.585
- [clears throat]
- That's not really gonna keep me warm.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.505
Can't you let me do nice things?
[groans] God!

23:43.588 --> 23:46.633
- Today sucked.
- Your parents' speech was weird.

23:46.716 --> 23:48.969
- I know. You have no idea.
- I kinda do.

23:49.052 --> 23:52.180
I'm pretty sure my dad cheats
on my mom, like, all the time.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.391
He makes me wait in the car
while he does it.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.518
Oh, Jay, I'm-- I'm sorry.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.645
Eh, don't be. Love dies.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.939
Let's bury the body together.

24:01.022 --> 24:03.358
Stop quoting your dad's law commercials.

24:03.441 --> 24:06.027
Kiss him. Kiss him hard on the mouth.

24:08.905 --> 24:12.409
Oh, my God, I can't believe
this is happening again!

24:12.492 --> 24:14.202
Shut up and kiss me.

24:14.286 --> 24:18.248
Now stick your pinkie
in his little toffee-colored tushie.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.292
Okay, I learned my lesson.

24:20.375 --> 24:22.878
You just go at your own pace,  bubbale.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.009
- Good night, Nicky.
- Good night, Mom.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.972
- Good night, Jay.
- Good night, Mr. Birch.

24:34.055 --> 24:36.433
I mean, Mom.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.519
- Sour Patch Kid?
- Sure.

24:39.603 --> 24:43.356
- Hey, Dad, you're not a lemon.
- Thanks, jellybean.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.525
You're my best little girl.

24:50.488 --> 24:52.574
[sobbing]

24:54.075 --> 24:55.577
[crying]

24:55.660 --> 24:59.080
- [howls]
- Oh, I knew it was too good to be true.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.041
It's worse than I thought.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.710
- And I knew it was gonna end badly.
- [sniffles]

25:03.793 --> 25:07.172
- You did?
- Of course. You're such a fucking dork!

25:07.255 --> 25:10.008
- I know.
- Aww, come here.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.427
[both sobbing]

25:16.264 --> 25:20.185
["I Want To Know What Love Is" playing]
