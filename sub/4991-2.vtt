WEBVTT

00:04.221 --> 00:05.555
Dude,
sorry you got rejected.

00:05.555 --> 00:07.991
What? No, I-- Where--
How did you know that?

00:07.991 --> 00:10.227
'Cause I threw you
a going-away party
and you're here.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.461
Italy rejected you.

00:11.461 --> 00:13.363
Now I'm being told
I can't expense the bar tab.

00:13.363 --> 00:14.998
Italy. Right. Yeah.

00:14.998 --> 00:16.533
Yeah. Sorry about that.

00:16.533 --> 00:18.235
I can totally pitch in if you--

00:18.235 --> 00:19.269
Thanks.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.370
It was a real
body-shot type of night.

00:20.370 --> 00:22.873
-Hoo-hoo!
-Ooh.

00:22.873 --> 00:24.574
Did you bring us back
any souvenirs?

00:25.742 --> 00:27.744
I never actually went to Italy.

00:27.744 --> 00:29.579
What about a souvenir
from the airport?

00:29.579 --> 00:31.615
Didn't make it there either.

00:31.615 --> 00:32.682
Oh.

00:32.682 --> 00:34.384
The Superior Scoop
said you did.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.424
I know you work with him,

00:41.424 --> 00:42.726
but you don't mind
if I get really graphic

00:42.726 --> 00:44.361
about my night
with Kevin, do you?

00:44.361 --> 00:46.730
More graphic
than you just were?

00:46.730 --> 00:50.233
How? You described
the way his back smelled.

00:50.233 --> 00:52.736
When a body part smells
like lemons and turkey dogs,

00:52.736 --> 00:53.770
it's worth noting.

00:53.770 --> 00:56.473
Anyway,
I've called and texted

00:56.473 --> 00:58.608
and he hasn't called me back,
and I don't know what to do.

00:58.608 --> 01:00.744
Look, Patti, you are
a great roommate,

01:00.744 --> 01:03.980
but I don't think I like being
in the middle of this thing
you have with Kevin.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.516
Oh. Okay.

01:06.516 --> 01:08.318
That's cool.

01:09.519 --> 01:11.421
Just delete the videos
I sent you then.

01:14.357 --> 01:15.358
(gasps)

01:21.965 --> 01:23.900
Come on.

01:33.410 --> 01:34.411
(growls quietly)

01:39.015 --> 01:40.884
<i>♪ 'Cause it's all good ♪</i>

01:40.884 --> 01:43.553
<i>♪ It's all, all,</i>
<i>it's all good ♪</i>

01:45.255 --> 01:46.523
(tires screech)

01:46.523 --> 01:48.425
Hey, thanks for the lift, man.

01:48.425 --> 01:50.560
The tow yard should be
releasing my car tomorrow,

01:50.560 --> 01:51.962
so this shouldn't be
for much longer.

01:51.962 --> 01:53.563
That's no problem.
I'm down for the carpool,

01:53.563 --> 01:55.332
saving the Earth
and whatnot.

01:55.332 --> 01:56.900
I know. It just makes me feel
a little uncomfortable.

01:56.900 --> 01:58.568
What? Freeloading-wise
or because I haven't made

01:58.568 --> 02:00.003
a good left turn
since you've been in here?

02:00.003 --> 02:01.805
Well, mostly because of him.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.441
-Who? Don?
-Yeah.

02:04.441 --> 02:06.409
-Oh, you're going
to have to get used to Don.
-Mm-hmm.

02:06.409 --> 02:09.512
When you left me for Italy,
I had to look after myself.

02:09.512 --> 02:10.680
I never went to Italy.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.382
Brian's profile said you did.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.518
You made me turn
to the Internet
to find a friend, Kevin.

02:15.518 --> 02:18.588
Let me tell you something.
You search
"fit man seeking man,"

02:18.588 --> 02:21.224
gonna find some crazy stuff.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.693
A lot of men out there
not as fit as what they claim.

02:23.693 --> 02:26.329
97% match.

02:26.329 --> 02:27.964
Two percent body fat.

02:27.964 --> 02:29.933
What's your body fat
percentage, Kev?

02:29.933 --> 02:31.601
A hundred percent
don't care, Don.

02:31.601 --> 02:33.603
-Hmm...
-Whoa!

02:33.603 --> 02:35.438
Go around the back.
Go around the back.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.576
Thought I saw Audrey.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.611
Not sure how many more
close calls with her I can take.

02:41.611 --> 02:42.846
(elevator dings)

02:42.846 --> 02:45.015
-Ha. No, after you.
-You know what? No, you.

02:45.015 --> 02:47.350
-I'll just...
-No, it's okay. I go.

02:47.350 --> 02:49.352
-Oh, my.
-Oh!

02:49.352 --> 02:51.955
-Oh my.
-Okay, bye. Bye.

02:59.229 --> 03:01.531
(sighs)
It's just so awkward.

03:01.531 --> 03:03.300
Why did I ever
write her a love letter?

03:03.300 --> 03:05.568
I could have lived
a full and happy life

03:05.568 --> 03:06.903
getting a Post-it Note
from her every morning,

03:06.903 --> 03:08.672
sharing a candy bar
every afternoon.

03:08.672 --> 03:10.307
I ruined everything.

03:10.307 --> 03:11.841
Gah! Okay.

03:11.841 --> 03:12.943
I gotta hurry in there.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.378
Gotta sit down before she does

03:15.378 --> 03:16.646
and not move
till after she leaves.

03:20.650 --> 03:21.851
Kev, Kev, your bag.

03:21.851 --> 03:24.554
-Your bag. Your bag.
-Yeah. Thank you.

03:24.554 --> 03:27.724
(romantic funk music playing)

03:38.568 --> 03:39.636
Kev, is that Audrey?

03:39.636 --> 03:42.472
Brian:
Was that her right there?

03:42.472 --> 03:44.474
-She's inside now. It's al--
-Shut up, man.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.575
Okay.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.615
(humming)

03:55.418 --> 03:56.586
Who are you?

03:56.586 --> 03:58.521
Patti.

03:58.521 --> 04:00.357
I can't get Kevin
to call me back,

04:00.357 --> 04:02.659
so I showed up
uninvited and came in
through the unlocked door.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.494
Who are you?

04:04.494 --> 04:06.262
Roxie. I'm Kevin's sister.

04:06.262 --> 04:07.664
I'm the one
who left the door unlocked.

04:07.664 --> 04:08.999
I didn't know he had a stalker.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.568
I didn't know he had a sister.

04:11.568 --> 04:13.503
I like your hat.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.673
I'm loving your entire outfit.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.641
Thank you.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.515
-How are you?
-Oh. You're here.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.517
It was so quiet over there.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.818
Well, I'm a super
quiet breather.

04:28.818 --> 04:31.388
Which is not why
I called you here today.

04:31.388 --> 04:32.522
Which I did not...

04:32.522 --> 04:34.657
I... I wanted to...

04:34.657 --> 04:35.892
tell you that
I'm moving desks.

04:35.892 --> 04:38.628
I just-- I...
I put in the request.

04:38.628 --> 04:40.897
I think it's gonna be
just better for both of us.

04:40.897 --> 04:42.332
Yeah. I think
that's a great idea.

04:42.332 --> 04:43.900
It's a good call... man.

04:45.602 --> 04:46.870
Hey, I hope you don't mind

04:46.870 --> 04:48.705
my hopping in here
before the chair is even cold.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.540
HR said I could take
possession of your desk

04:50.540 --> 04:52.642
as long as
I waive the inspection.

04:52.642 --> 04:54.611
How did you even
know I was moving?

04:54.611 --> 04:56.613
There was a notice
in The Superior Scoop.

04:56.613 --> 05:00.016
Hey, you don't mind if I make
a few minor changes, do you?

05:00.016 --> 05:02.252
I just need something
that works for the way I live.

05:05.488 --> 05:07.557
Hey, neighbs.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.559
So Patti is stalking me?

05:09.559 --> 05:11.394
I know.
I was as surprised as you are.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.495
Oh. Cinnamon.

05:12.495 --> 05:14.264
No, no, no.
Wait, wait. Jalapeño.

05:14.264 --> 05:15.832
Oh, this is so hard.

05:15.832 --> 05:17.801
Oh, man.
What am I gonna tell her?

05:17.801 --> 05:19.669
Oh, nothing.
I already took care of it.

05:19.669 --> 05:21.604
Here's the thing, girl.

05:21.604 --> 05:22.872
Kevin has a fiancée.

05:22.872 --> 05:24.941
-He does?
-Yes.

05:24.941 --> 05:26.876
And at your apartment that day,
he was trying to get

05:26.876 --> 05:29.345
a wedding invitation back
that he sent to Audrey.

05:29.345 --> 05:30.747
His fiancée made him
uninvite work people

05:30.747 --> 05:33.316
'cause they're trying to save
money for their triplets.

05:34.851 --> 05:36.886
But I made him make love to me.

05:36.886 --> 05:39.522
I know.
He slipped up.

05:39.522 --> 05:41.224
But if it makes
you feel any better,

05:41.224 --> 05:43.626
he said it was a really,
really unusual experience.

05:43.626 --> 05:44.694
Oh.

05:44.694 --> 05:46.696
-He did?
-Yeah.

05:46.696 --> 05:49.933
And if I were you, I would just
forget about him and move on.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.735
You're too good
for him anyway.

05:52.735 --> 05:53.970
(slurps)

05:53.970 --> 05:56.673
I'm not sure lying
about a fiancée
was the best idea?

05:56.673 --> 05:57.874
Oh, no. Trust me, Kev.

05:57.874 --> 05:59.609
With a girl like Patti,
you want to make sure

05:59.609 --> 06:01.678
she knows
there is zero chance.

06:01.678 --> 06:03.680
It was either a fiancée
of faking your death,

06:03.680 --> 06:04.981
<i>which takes a lot of time.</i>

06:04.981 --> 06:07.750
Honestly, that's just not
time that I have right now.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.519
-(phone beeps)
-Okay, where was I?

06:11.621 --> 06:13.590
Hi. Welcome.

06:13.590 --> 06:16.292
I'm Simon,
this is Paul Garfunkel.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.461
Some people call us
the famous singing duo's names.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.929
Simon and Garfunkel.
I get it.

06:19.929 --> 06:21.598
No. Common mistake.

06:21.598 --> 06:25.001
It's Hall and Oates
because I like to pace
the hallway like an animal,

06:25.001 --> 06:26.636
and he eats dry oatmeal.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.607
It's nice to meet you guys.

06:32.509 --> 06:34.444
Simon would like
to apologize for his odor.

06:34.444 --> 06:36.412
It's just my shingles cream.

06:44.888 --> 06:46.923
Excuse me,
is there a shade for that?

06:49.225 --> 06:50.894
Never mind.

06:50.894 --> 06:52.362
(slurping)

06:53.997 --> 06:55.431
Whoa.

06:55.431 --> 06:57.534
Ricky, did you
just lose power?

06:57.534 --> 06:59.936
Yes, of my own body.
I have restless feet syndrome

06:59.936 --> 07:01.538
and kicked out the cords.
Don't worry.

07:01.538 --> 07:03.540
It only happens
a few times a day.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.476
-(clattering)
-Oh my...

07:06.476 --> 07:07.477
Sorry!

07:08.645 --> 07:10.713
Do you want me to put
my balls on your neck?

07:11.848 --> 07:12.849
What?

07:14.317 --> 07:15.718
(chuckles)

07:15.718 --> 07:16.953
Let me just confirm

07:16.953 --> 07:18.755
that you're talking
about the wooden things

07:18.755 --> 07:19.689
-in your hand.
-Yeah.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.457
That's the way
we take a break.

07:21.457 --> 07:23.426
Break is exactly what we need!

07:23.426 --> 07:25.395
Why don't we share
a candy bar, huh?

07:25.395 --> 07:26.462
Simon? Garfunkel?

07:26.462 --> 07:28.998
Simon! Candy break!

07:30.466 --> 07:32.569
Uh...

07:37.507 --> 07:40.310
Who did this?
Who-- Who has done this?

07:40.310 --> 07:41.778
Ricky, calm down.

07:41.778 --> 07:43.246
It was me.

07:44.847 --> 07:45.949
What's your game, sister?

07:45.949 --> 07:47.750
I was trying to be nice.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.553
By making fun of my round head.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.455
No. That is not you.

07:52.455 --> 07:53.690
It's a smiley face,

07:53.690 --> 07:55.959
the universal
sign of friendliness.

07:55.959 --> 07:59.796
I always did it for Kevin
and he never once yelled at me.

07:59.796 --> 08:01.464
Oh. That's sweet, but...

08:01.464 --> 08:03.700
I'm going to report you
for aggressive behavior.

08:03.700 --> 08:04.734
What?

08:04.734 --> 08:07.370
Yes, bitch.

08:19.882 --> 08:21.251
Kevin:
Hi. I'm sorry.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.219
You know, maybe moving
wasn't a solution.

08:23.219 --> 08:25.421
Kevin, I hate this
new desk arrangement.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.292
Look, I never should have
written you that letter.

08:29.292 --> 08:30.893
I...

08:30.893 --> 08:32.762
I was drunk
and I poured my heart out

08:32.762 --> 08:35.298
and I said some
stupid, stupid things

08:35.298 --> 08:36.666
-and--
-Kevin, please.

08:36.666 --> 08:39.302
-You don't need to
apologize for anything.
-No, yes I do.

08:39.302 --> 08:42.405
I really screwed up
when I mailed it to you,

08:42.405 --> 08:44.574
and now we're stuck
being awkward around each other.

08:44.574 --> 08:46.442
I'm getting massages
I don't even want.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.844
I-- I probably have shingles!

08:47.844 --> 08:50.446
God. I saw him hug you.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.748
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.916
I just don't want people
to find out about that letter.

08:53.916 --> 08:57.420
Look, Kevin,
I am really flattered

08:57.420 --> 09:00.390
and I really don't want
to hurt your feelings,

09:00.390 --> 09:05.561
-but I have a boyfriend
and I'm with him...
-I know.

09:05.561 --> 09:08.264
so I'm okay with everything
if you are.

09:08.264 --> 09:10.300
You know, we can just
keep working here

09:10.300 --> 09:13.636
and be normal and just go
back to the way it was before.

09:15.405 --> 09:16.706
Okay?

09:16.706 --> 09:17.874
Okay.

09:17.874 --> 09:19.876
-Great. That would be great.
-Yeah.

09:19.876 --> 09:21.277
Where's Don?

09:21.277 --> 09:22.645
Oh. Don's at his mom's.

09:22.645 --> 09:23.980
I'm supposed to pick him up
in about an hour.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.882
We're gonna go
to the driving range,
get our haircuts.

09:25.882 --> 09:28.851
He's going to take me
to his orthotics guy,
you know?

09:28.851 --> 09:30.620
But my feet don't hurt, man!

09:30.620 --> 09:34.257
Look, Kevin, he's suffocating
me and I need your help
to get rid of him.

09:35.558 --> 09:37.393
Look, I panicked
when you went to Italy.

09:37.393 --> 09:39.862
-I never actually...
-Now that you're back,
I don't need him.

09:39.862 --> 09:41.531
He wants to be
my best friend.

09:41.531 --> 09:42.932
I get it.
I'm the bomb.

09:42.932 --> 09:45.368
But I have you.

09:45.368 --> 09:48.604
And if I need orthotics...
I want you to take me.

09:48.604 --> 09:50.440
So get out of it.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.842
Don't overthink it.

09:52.842 --> 09:55.845
See that's-- that's why
you're my 100% match.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.780
Brian:
That's why
you're my 100%.

09:57.780 --> 10:00.483
<i>♪ Sit back</i>
<i>and watch me do it ♪</i>

10:00.483 --> 10:01.517

10:01.517 --> 10:04.620

10:04.620 --> 10:06.456
Smokin' Hot.

10:06.456 --> 10:08.558
-Sounds about right.
-I'll say!

10:08.558 --> 10:09.892
(laughing)

10:09.892 --> 10:10.927
Hi!

10:10.927 --> 10:12.695
Oh, my God!

10:12.695 --> 10:15.598
I was just next door
at the sunglasses place
when I read your Tweet!

10:15.598 --> 10:16.733
"At the Polish Bar.

10:16.733 --> 10:18.735
Help me decide
which color, bitches."

10:18.735 --> 10:21.804
Then I realized I could be
a bitch that votes in person!

10:21.804 --> 10:25.541
So... red!

10:25.541 --> 10:26.909
You just happened
to be right next door?

10:26.909 --> 10:28.010
Mm-hmm!

10:28.010 --> 10:31.714
Patti:
Oh, my God.
Oh, this is heaven.

10:31.714 --> 10:35.385
I'm so glad this gives us
an opportunity to talk.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.920
You know, about what happened
with me and your brother and...

10:37.920 --> 10:40.323
just how I'm feeling.

10:40.323 --> 10:41.357
Okay.

10:41.357 --> 10:42.925
It's just that when
I broke into your apartment

10:42.925 --> 10:44.660
and like, you told me
that if you were me,

10:44.660 --> 10:46.429
you would just forget
about him and move on,

10:46.429 --> 10:48.498
that I was like,
too good for him anyway,

10:48.498 --> 10:49.832
that really helped me.

10:51.467 --> 10:54.771
I was wondering if you had
any more advice for me, girl.

10:56.339 --> 10:57.874
She's following me, Kev.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.642
And not the good
kind of following.

10:59.642 --> 11:01.844
I think you're overreacting.

11:01.844 --> 11:03.246
<i>She hasn't left</i>
<i>me alone all day!</i>

11:03.246 --> 11:05.581
So thanks a lot.
You gave me your stalker.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.617
I don't think
she's stalking you.

11:07.617 --> 11:09.886
Oh, Kev, you are
so egotistical.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.821
What? You think you're
the only one who's stalkable?

11:11.821 --> 11:12.955
(sighs)

11:12.955 --> 11:17.627
(sing-songy)
Someone's got a secret crush
that's not so secret.

11:17.627 --> 11:19.529
Check The Scoop.

11:30.673 --> 11:32.875
Audrey.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.977
Can I speak to you
for a minute, please?

11:34.977 --> 11:36.746
All:
Ooh!

11:43.553 --> 11:44.854
I am so sorry, Kevin.

11:44.854 --> 11:46.589
I have no idea
how people found out.

11:46.589 --> 11:47.957
Look, can I just have
the letter back please?

11:47.957 --> 11:50.259
I don't want to run
the risk of it falling
into the wrong hands.

11:50.259 --> 11:52.295
I don't even
have the letter anymore.

11:53.930 --> 11:55.431
I threw it out.

11:55.431 --> 12:00.803
(distorted music slows, stops)

12:00.803 --> 12:02.472
-Oh. You did?
-Mm-hmm.

12:02.472 --> 12:05.708
So it is gone and forgotten.

12:05.708 --> 12:07.310
Good.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.745
-Good. That is good news.
-Yeah.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.487
What?

12:19.455 --> 12:21.924
Oh, no.

12:21.924 --> 12:22.925
No.

12:26.629 --> 12:29.398
You know what, Garfunkel?
The way things are going today,

12:29.398 --> 12:31.367
I don't even care
if those aren't the wooden ones.

12:33.236 --> 12:35.438
-You can take it. Take it.
<i>-Ah-ah-ah...</i>

12:35.438 --> 12:37.473
Julia, hi. Can we talk
to you for a second?

12:37.473 --> 12:38.474
(woman in video gasps)

12:42.645 --> 12:45.982
Do you have any idea
who writes the gossip section
in The Superior Scoop?

12:45.982 --> 12:47.316
(scoffs) Please.

12:47.316 --> 12:50.219
I don't have time
for that kind of trash.

12:50.219 --> 12:50.887
It's just...

12:50.887 --> 12:52.688
It's obvious
that somebody is

12:52.688 --> 12:55.258
listening to our conversations
and then writing about it,

12:55.258 --> 12:56.959
and we're just wondering
if there's any way that we could

12:56.959 --> 12:58.628
have a look
at the security camera footage.

12:58.628 --> 12:59.929
Security cameras?

12:59.929 --> 13:01.697
I don't even know
if I remember that link.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.666
I mean, they're probably
not even operating anymore.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.569
Oh! Yeah, I got it
up and running.

13:06.569 --> 13:08.971
-Right there!
The security camera.
-Oh.

13:08.971 --> 13:11.774
Is that the bathroom?

13:11.774 --> 13:14.010
Wait. What's Ricky doing?

13:14.010 --> 13:17.246
Mm. That is one
weird Mexican Sumo.

13:17.246 --> 13:18.748
He's not even moving.
He's just standing there.

13:18.748 --> 13:21.450
Julia:
He'll do that all day long.
Good stuff, right?

13:26.522 --> 13:31.360
I mean, why would
he be standing... here?

13:31.360 --> 13:33.496
What...

13:33.496 --> 13:35.498
(Brian's voice reverberating)
Look, you don't know how
to take no for an answer, Don.

13:35.498 --> 13:37.733
Who is that?

13:37.733 --> 13:40.336
It sounded like my buddy,
Brian, but it couldn't be.

13:40.336 --> 13:43.472
When I found you,
I was like Bobby Brown
leaving New Edition,

13:43.472 --> 13:45.341
but I found
my prerogative, okay?

13:45.341 --> 13:46.375
-Yeah.
-Don't be cruel!

13:46.375 --> 13:47.643
(inaudible)

13:49.378 --> 13:52.281
(Don's voice reverberating)
I would hate for you to
dump me and then find yourself

13:52.281 --> 13:55.384
abandoned down the line
when your perfect friend
decides to go back to Italy.

13:55.384 --> 13:56.652
Brian:
I know what you're doing, Don.

13:56.652 --> 13:58.287
I know what you're doing
and it's not gonna work!

13:58.287 --> 14:00.256
-The zombie movie, you know?
-Don't you talk about...

14:00.256 --> 14:04.293
Every time we talked,
we were in that exact spot.

14:04.293 --> 14:07.229
Ricky heard
everything from here.

14:07.229 --> 14:09.231
Here is my
seat reassignment long-form.

14:09.231 --> 14:11.667
You can give my old desk
to someone else.

14:13.970 --> 14:15.605
I don't even have
the letter anymore.

14:15.605 --> 14:18.307
(Audrey's voice reverberates)
I threw it out.

14:18.307 --> 14:20.409
Audrey:
<i>Our voices must have</i>
<i>traveled across the ceiling.</i>

14:20.409 --> 14:22.011
Trashed.

14:22.011 --> 14:24.013
He's the one
who is writing about us.

14:24.013 --> 14:27.583
Ricky! Unbelievable.
I feel so betrayed.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.619
I held his hand through
all of his feet spasms.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.786
We have to get back at him.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.555
-Vengeance will be mine!
-And mine!

14:32.555 --> 14:34.824
And-- and your...
both of ours.

14:34.824 --> 14:36.359
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

14:36.359 --> 14:38.527
(overlapping chatter)

14:38.527 --> 14:40.563
Kevin, remember Don?

14:40.563 --> 14:41.964
Oh hey, bro.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.433
Can you please explain to Don
that you and I are reunited

14:44.433 --> 14:46.268
and his friendship services
are no longer required?

14:46.268 --> 14:49.505
Brian, Audrey and I are
in the middle of something.
It's kind of an emergency.

14:49.505 --> 14:51.741
More of an emergency
than making it clear
that you and I got a bond

14:51.741 --> 14:53.809
stronger than any friend
matching website can calculate?

14:53.809 --> 14:57.380
Well, this seems
like guy talk, sort of.

14:57.380 --> 15:00.549
Come find me
when you're ready
for the vengeance.

15:00.549 --> 15:02.451
-Bye, guys.
-See you later.

15:02.451 --> 15:04.353
-Don.
-Huh?

15:04.353 --> 15:06.222
Brian doesn't want to be
your friend anymore, okay?

15:06.222 --> 15:08.557
Sometimes people make choices
and they second guess

15:08.557 --> 15:10.326
and they don't mean
to hurt your feelings,

15:10.326 --> 15:12.294
but it just happens.

15:12.294 --> 15:13.396
You mean it?

15:17.400 --> 15:18.834
'Cause it did hurt, you know.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.270
Just so you know,
when you-- when you left
me and you went to Italy--

15:21.270 --> 15:22.738
I never went to Italy.

15:22.738 --> 15:24.373
Okay, well, whatever you did,
you did it without telling me.

15:24.373 --> 15:26.275
-I would never do that.
-Don...

15:26.275 --> 15:28.310
you need to move on, man.

15:28.310 --> 15:31.781
You're gonna find
your fit man seeking man.

15:31.781 --> 15:33.416
This one is mine.

15:33.416 --> 15:34.784
(sighs)
Well, it's clear to me that

15:34.784 --> 15:37.319
I'm not going to be able
to break up what you guys have.

15:37.319 --> 15:38.621
So...

15:38.621 --> 15:40.589
Would you consider
adding a third?

15:41.657 --> 15:43.693
That's a totally
different website, Don.

15:46.228 --> 15:47.596
Roxie:
Hello, Patti.

15:47.596 --> 15:50.299
Ah! Roxie!
Oh, my God!

15:50.299 --> 15:51.467
What are you doing here?

15:51.467 --> 15:53.969
Same thing you've been
doing to me. Stalking.

15:53.969 --> 15:55.304
I wasn't stalking you.

15:55.304 --> 15:58.274
Okay, well, then explain
why you followed me around

15:58.274 --> 16:00.342
and you told me
all of your personal business

16:00.342 --> 16:02.278
and you like, expected me
to give you advice or something?

16:02.278 --> 16:03.979
I mean, I was terrified.

16:03.979 --> 16:05.781
If my nails weren't wet,
I would have maced you.

16:05.781 --> 16:07.316
I was just
trying to talk to you.

16:07.316 --> 16:09.919
Who talks about their feelings
in a nail salon?

16:09.919 --> 16:11.754
Like, every woman ever.

16:11.754 --> 16:13.355
Do you not have
any girlfriends?

16:13.355 --> 16:15.491
I mean, I had one
in like, tenth grade.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.827
Oh. You don't mean sexually.

16:17.827 --> 16:20.262
Well, I had one
in eighth grade,

16:20.262 --> 16:22.965
but she was mean to me
and then I was mean to her

16:22.965 --> 16:24.400
and then that was basically it.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.368
Well, maybe it's time
for a new one.

16:26.368 --> 16:28.471
You're lucky.
I'm a really good friend.

16:28.471 --> 16:29.672
Do you day drink?

16:29.672 --> 16:31.373
Well, it's the day
and I am drunk,

16:31.373 --> 16:32.742
so you tell me.

16:36.479 --> 16:38.514
I mean, Julia's our boss.

16:38.514 --> 16:42.518
I can't believe she wants
Ricky to do her in her office.

16:42.518 --> 16:43.786
But that's what she said.

16:43.786 --> 16:46.689
She said, "I want Ricky
to do me in my office."

16:46.689 --> 16:48.357
(Audrey's voice reverberates)
Lots of times.

16:48.357 --> 16:49.692
Didn't she also
say, "Lots of times?"

16:49.692 --> 16:50.960
Kevin:
Yes, she did.
She did say that.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.929
"I want Ricky to do me
all the ways that...

16:53.929 --> 16:57.299
I am to be done.
Plow me like the fields."

16:57.299 --> 16:58.567
(both snickering)

17:01.837 --> 17:04.406
Audrey:
"Are sparks flying
between a loyal leader

17:04.406 --> 17:07.376
"and a certain husky man
in plaid who craves

17:07.376 --> 17:10.713
"a strict hand
of a mature beauty?

17:10.713 --> 17:12.381
Stay tuned."

17:12.381 --> 17:14.483
I almost feel bad.

17:16.318 --> 17:17.520

17:34.336 --> 17:36.739
I don't know whether
to never talk about this again

17:36.739 --> 17:38.574
or to never stop
talking about this.

17:38.574 --> 17:40.309
Never stop talking about this.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.912
-Definitely never stop
talking about this.
-Okay.

17:42.912 --> 17:46.382
-Aww.
-And Kevin is
a total crier, of course.

17:46.382 --> 17:48.417
Of course! Idiot.

17:50.252 --> 17:51.921
Well, at least he was
when he was a kid.

17:51.921 --> 17:53.956
Oh... Idiot!

17:56.392 --> 17:57.526
Ooh! Pizza's here!

17:57.526 --> 17:59.361
Oh, shoot!
Do you have any cash?

17:59.361 --> 18:01.463
This place doesn't take
my dad's credit card.

18:01.463 --> 18:02.665
All I have is
my brother's credit card.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.466
Aww, I love how
entitled you are.

18:04.466 --> 18:05.868
I love how entitled you are!

18:05.868 --> 18:07.403
-No wonder we're friends!
-(giggles)

18:07.403 --> 18:08.637
Your roommate has a passport.

18:08.637 --> 18:09.872
I'm sure she has
money somewhere.

18:09.872 --> 18:11.240
Yes!

18:11.240 --> 18:14.710
You know, all this time
I've been imagining how great

18:14.710 --> 18:16.378
Audrey and I would be
if she would just give

18:16.378 --> 18:17.613
me the chance,
and then today at work,

18:17.613 --> 18:20.449
we actually
were great together, but...

18:20.449 --> 18:22.351
she threw out the letter.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.420
I'm sorry, man.

18:24.420 --> 18:26.655
No, it's okay.

18:26.655 --> 18:28.657

I can't find any!

18:58.487 --> 19:00.222
You're cute.

19:01.824 --> 19:05.427
Until then,
Kevin from work."

19:07.897 --> 19:09.265
My Kevin?

19:10.766 --> 19:11.967
What are you
doing this weekend?

19:11.967 --> 19:13.402
Do you want to drive
me to Coachella?

19:13.402 --> 19:14.570
Patti:
Why didn't you tell me?

19:14.570 --> 19:16.238
I thought you were my friend.

19:19.608 --> 19:21.477
I'm sorry I lied, Patti.

19:21.477 --> 19:22.745
But that's before
we were friends.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.546
I would never
ever lie to you now.

19:26.515 --> 19:27.850
Is this top too bright?

19:29.752 --> 19:31.887
(sighs)
A little.

19:33.355 --> 19:34.556
You really are my girl.

19:36.358 --> 19:37.893
But just so you know,
I'm about to do something

19:37.893 --> 19:39.428
to your brother
that might test
our friendship.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.530
It's understandable.

19:41.530 --> 19:42.531
Boop.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.468
-Boop.
-(laughs)

19:46.468 --> 19:48.370
Both:
Boop!

19:48.370 --> 19:49.616
Both:
Boop!

19:51.941 --> 19:53.676
Brian:
All right.

19:54.710 --> 19:56.512
Kevin:
Well, I appreciate it.

19:59.515 --> 20:01.617
-You good? Bye.
-Thanks for the ride.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.219
"Lie fell apart. Oops!"

20:04.219 --> 20:05.554
Hi, Kevin.

20:05.554 --> 20:07.323
Brian!

20:07.323 --> 20:10.559
I heard things didn't quite
work out with your fiancée.

20:10.559 --> 20:14.630
Patti, don't be upset.
I-- I can explain.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.931
Oh, really?

20:15.931 --> 20:17.499
You can explain this?

20:19.501 --> 20:21.904
(majestic music playing)

20:21.904 --> 20:23.706
She kept it!

20:25.341 --> 20:26.342
Ah!
