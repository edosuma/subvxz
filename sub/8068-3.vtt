Oh, you've got to be joking.

02:02.723 --> 02:06.394

serious, you're dead.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.728
What are you talking about?

02:07.828 --> 02:10.931
Does a candlelight dinner

No, Dan.

02:26.180 --> 02:26.980

Awe, you're tired, honey?

03:21.068 --> 03:24.071
Well, we're not going

03:24.171 --> 03:26.039
We're going to the Lanford Inn.

03:26.139 --> 03:26.907
Whoa, whoa.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.008
That's a little steep, honey.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.477
We can't afford that.

doing it all wrong.

03:46.794 --> 03:47.728
I know, honey.

03:47.828 --> 03:51.332
But that's the way
your daddy likes it.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.768
Now see, first, you apply
it to the apple of your cheek.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.237
Then you blend down
your cheekbone.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.940
Well, that's how the famous
models do it in Europe.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.074
Roseanne, where's Jackie?

04:01.174 --> 04:01.975
I give up, Dan.

04:02.075 --> 04:02.910
Where is Jackie?

04:03.010 --> 04:04.978

- Listen.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.449
I didn't put on no tie,

04:08.549 --> 04:09.783
I can babysit.

04:09.883 --> 04:10.984
Well, you won't have to.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.953
She'll show up.

04:13.053 --> 04:13.987
Well, what if she doesn't?

04:14.087 --> 04:14.888
She will.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.960
Honey, get away from here and
give me all that stuff would

You're too young.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.211
Darn, I hope Ant
Jackie gets here.

we'll have to stay home.

04:41.882 --> 04:45.085
You know, if Jackie doesn't
show up, you can go right ahead

04:45.185 --> 04:46.186
and babysit.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.089
Thanks, mom.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.157
Don't put my shoes on, honey.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.592

cute, except for one thing.

05:14.114 --> 05:17.718
Roseanne, you broke my tie.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.152

serves me correctly,

05:24.992 --> 05:27.194
I believe they have a dance
floor there at the Lanford Inn.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.095
Uh uh.

05:28.195 --> 05:28.996
No way, babe.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.163
You know I don't dance.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.064
Why?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.265
You used to dance all the time.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.635
Yeah, well, that's when
I knew all the steps.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.936

go dancing with my special girl

And what if somebody calls?

06:21.815 --> 06:23.316
Don't tell them
you're not home.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.317

Pretty nice place.

it's Patsy, if I don't look.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.071
Well, look.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.306
But don't look, look.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.113
That's her.
Isn't it?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.114
Yeah, but that ain't Bob.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.015
No kidding.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.717
[audience laughing]

09:09.817 --> 09:11.018
What are you supposed to do?

09:11.118 --> 09:14.988
Oh, come on-- it's so
obvious that's her lover.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.556
Can you believe she
brought him here?

09:16.657 --> 09:18.525
They probably got a coupon.

09:18.626 --> 09:21.528
[audience laughing]

09:21.629 --> 09:25.532
Well, when I have an affair, I
always go to the no tell motel.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.466
Me too.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.101
Well, I've never
seen you there.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.469
Oh, I'm there all the time.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.038
[audience laughing]

09:31.138 --> 09:31.939
Me too.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.373
Maybe we should carpool.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.375
[audience laughing]

09:35.475 --> 09:36.744
- Roseanne!
- Oh Dan, look.

09:36.844 --> 09:37.778
It's Patsy.
- Hi!

09:37.878 --> 09:38.679
Patsy!

09:38.779 --> 09:40.013
Hi, Patsy.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.482
Well, I haven't seen
you since the Paris'

09:42.582 --> 09:44.117
barbecue, last summer.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.352
That's right.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.519
Where's Bob?

09:46.620 --> 09:48.822
[audience laughing]

09:48.922 --> 09:51.058
Oh, I guess you don't know.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.026
Bob and I got divorced.
ROSEANNE: [gasps]

09:53.126 --> 09:54.094
Oh, sorry to hear that.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.429
Well, you know,
these things happen.

09:56.529 --> 09:57.931
Are you OK, Patsy?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.132
Oh, Yeah.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.500
I mean, I wish things
could have been different,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.971
but Bob just couldn't
handle my going to college.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.038
Get outta hear!

10:05.138 --> 10:06.439
You ain't going to college.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.307
Oh, sure.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.608
That was always the plan.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.144
Once the kids were gone,
I was going to school.

10:11.244 --> 10:15.248
But the time came and Bob said
I couldn't go, and I said, bye.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.917
Well, it's his loss.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.185
Oh, thanks.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.086
Oh, listen.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.120
I better get back to my date.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.454
It's been great seeing you.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.355
Take care.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.724
Yeah, take it easy, kid.

10:23.824 --> 10:24.624
Bye.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.062
Boy, that's a shame
about Bob and Patsy.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.530
Yeah, it really is.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.867
She seems to be handling
it pretty good though.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.304
Dan, she is a shattered woman.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.471
And why?

10:38.571 --> 10:41.108
I bet you Bob refused
to dance with her.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.210
[audience laughing]

10:43.310 --> 10:44.111
Humph.

10:53.586 --> 10:54.688
I just can't figure
it out they were

10:54.788 --> 10:56.023
always hugging and kissing.

10:56.123 --> 10:56.990
Yeah.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.491
You mean like at
that barbecue where

10:58.591 --> 11:00.093
she was sitting in
that lawn chair,

11:00.193 --> 11:04.231
and running her fingers through
what was left of his hair.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.199
Yeah, like that.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.935
Yeah well, get real.

11:08.035 --> 11:09.302
They were doomed.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.704
What are you talking about?

11:10.804 --> 11:13.874
Well, you know all that lovey,
dovey crap is a dead giveaway.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.010
It's fighting that keeps
a marriage together.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.713
Well, it that's true, you and
me will be together forever.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.648
[audience laughing]

11:21.749 --> 11:23.383
Don't count on it, lover boy.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.153
I got plenty
reasons to dump you.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.154
Name one.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.188
Your a compulsive list maker--

11:28.288 --> 11:29.089
Name two.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.491
Shut up.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.593
Well, if anybody's got
grounds for divorce, it's me.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.494
Oh, Yeah?

11:34.594 --> 11:35.628
Like what?

11:35.729 --> 11:37.998
Like you used my razor
to shave your legs.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.868
Well, let me pack up my
bags and leave in shame.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.737
[audience laughing]
- Go ahead and laugh.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.939
That'll hold up in any
court in the country.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.607
Not after I tell
that jury that you

11:47.707 --> 11:50.310
hang your dirty underwear
up on the door knob.

11:50.410 --> 11:51.611
[audience laughing]

11:51.711 --> 11:53.146
Oh, yeah?
ROSEANNE: Yeah.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.248
Wait till I tell them that
you've never once accompanied

11:55.348 --> 11:57.717
me to the annual
Lanford subcontractors

11:57.818 --> 12:00.087
beer bash and softball game.

12:00.187 --> 12:01.889
You wouldn't.

12:01.989 --> 12:06.293
So you're going
to divorce me, huh?

12:06.393 --> 12:08.461
Not on your luckiest day,
which you couldn't make

12:08.561 --> 12:10.263
it through without me anyways.

12:10.363 --> 12:13.466
Close your eyes,
and count to three.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.103
Well you know what, if you
ever even thought about it,

12:16.203 --> 12:17.938
I'd have you hung
up by your toes

12:18.038 --> 12:20.373
and tortured with bizarre
liquid household products.

12:20.473 --> 12:24.644
[audience laughing]

12:24.744 --> 12:25.712
Oh, yeah?

12:25.813 --> 12:26.613
Yeah.

12:26.713 --> 12:27.647
- Well I'd--
- You'd what?

12:27.747 --> 12:28.548
I'd--

12:28.648 --> 12:29.817
You'd what?

12:29.917 --> 12:31.118
I'd leave you the kids.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.787
[audience laughing]

12:33.887 --> 12:36.289
You wouldn't.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.025
DAN: All three of them.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.292
I wouldn't take them.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.293
Neither would I.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.762
I'd give them to Jackie.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.932
Hell, even I don't
hate her that much.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.868
[audience laughing]

12:58.812 --> 13:00.747
What are you doing?

13:00.848 --> 13:02.015
Making popcorn.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.550
Mom said we're not
allowed to use the stove.

13:03.650 --> 13:04.584
Remember?

13:04.684 --> 13:06.286
I'm not going
to use the stove.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.155
Well, what are you going
to do, eat it out of the pan?

13:08.255 --> 13:09.522
No.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.423
I'm going to take it outside
and wait for a bolt of lightning

13:10.523 --> 13:11.391
to hit it.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.392
[audience laughing]

13:12.492 --> 13:13.293
Here.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.464
Thanks, Deej.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.365
What's that for?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.800
We're gonna make popcorn.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.669
With a heating pad?

13:22.769 --> 13:25.438
- Darlene said it would work.
- Oh, yeah?

13:25.538 --> 13:28.241
Hey, Mom didn't say
anything against heating pads.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.176
Yeah.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.510
Go right ahead.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.046
But it won't work

13:33.146 --> 13:34.247
You sit right
here, and hold this

13:34.347 --> 13:36.449
here till it starts popping.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.185
I know that.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.153
[phone rings]

13:40.253 --> 13:41.788
Don't say Mom and
Dad aren't here.

13:41.889 --> 13:42.890
I know that.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.594
Hello.

13:47.694 --> 13:51.798
Um, they can't come to
the phone right now.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.066
Um, they're in the shower.

13:53.166 --> 13:53.967
Yeah.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.903
Yeah.

13:56.003 --> 13:59.039
Yeah, both of them.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.173
Oh, about two more hours.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.042
[audience laughing]

14:02.142 --> 14:03.410
Yeah, OK.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.377
Thanks.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.779
Bye.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.249
Who was that?

14:09.349 --> 14:10.183
I don't know.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.084
[audience laughing]

14:11.184 --> 14:12.886
[doorbell rings]
- Hold it!

14:12.986 --> 14:13.921
I'll get the door.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.024
Darlene, unplug that thing.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.725
Ask who it is.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.460
I know that, DJ.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.361
Who is it?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.496
JACKIE: It's me.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.831
Me who?

14:24.932 --> 14:27.434
JACKIE: Ant Jackie--
open the door.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.137
But how do we know
it's really you?

14:30.237 --> 14:31.939
Yeah.
[audience laughing]

14:32.039 --> 14:33.473
If you don't open
the door, you're going

14:33.573 --> 14:35.575
to find out it's really me.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.844
We're not supposed to
open the door for anybody.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.512
Becky, I mean it.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.981
You're late.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.482
[audience laughing]
Yeah.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.984
You were supposed
to be here at 7:00.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.152
Where have you been?

14:45.252 --> 14:47.654
I had to go to the
store and return a blouse.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.323
[interposing voices]

14:50.423 --> 14:52.525
Just open the door!

14:52.625 --> 14:55.328
Can't

14:55.428 --> 14:56.829
I know how to get
into this house.

14:56.930 --> 14:57.730
No, you don't

14:57.830 --> 14:59.099
- Oh, yeah right.
- OK.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.500
Fine.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.435
I got better things to do than
babysit the three little pigs.

15:02.535 --> 15:05.738
You're on your own.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.907
Ant Jackie?

15:08.008 --> 15:08.942
Back door--

15:09.042 --> 15:09.842
Yeah!

15:18.685 --> 15:19.552
Do you her?

15:19.652 --> 15:20.453
Shh.

15:20.553 --> 15:21.654
I think I hear her.
- Where?

15:21.754 --> 15:22.555
Shh.

15:29.196 --> 15:29.997
[screams]

15:30.097 --> 15:30.998
ALL: [screaming]

15:31.098 --> 15:37.470
[audience laughing]

15:37.570 --> 15:38.471
I called.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.772
Everything's fine.

15:39.872 --> 15:43.276
Dopey finally showed up.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.045
Now where's Chuck?

15:45.145 --> 15:45.945
Relax.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.780
He'll be back in a minute.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.449
I want some more coffee.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.084
I'm gonna go get it.
- Roseanne, sit down.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.919
Oh, it's OK.
I'll be right back.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.362
You want some coffee?

16:02.462 --> 16:09.369
[audience laughing]

16:09.469 --> 16:10.270
Coffee?

16:15.075 --> 16:17.677
Hey there, good looking,
what about a warm up, huh?

16:17.777 --> 16:18.845
Hit me, Trixie.

16:18.945 --> 16:19.746
Ooh.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.518
I'm a little behind.

16:25.618 --> 16:26.886
Oh, that's OK, Chuck.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.188
Hey, she wants a decaf.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.089
Thanks.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.391
[audience laughing]

16:31.491 --> 16:33.393
You know Rosie,
I've been thinking.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.761
Don't do that.

16:34.861 --> 16:37.164
[audience laughing]

16:37.264 --> 16:40.067
I been thinking about
all the couples we know.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.768
Almost all of them are divorced.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.903
Well, maybe we
should try it too.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.472
[audience laughing]

16:45.572 --> 16:46.706
Maybe we should.

16:46.806 --> 16:47.607
OK.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.679
There-- we're divorced, master.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.014
Thanks, Genie.

16:55.115 --> 16:55.915
Ah!

16:56.015 --> 16:57.317
Well, what are you going to do?

16:57.417 --> 16:59.486
The first thing I'm going to
do is, I'm going to go dancing.

16:59.586 --> 17:00.587
Ha, ha.
Yeah?

17:00.687 --> 17:01.821
Then what?

17:01.921 --> 17:04.491
Well, I guess with all
that big time child support

17:04.591 --> 17:06.025
I'm getting from you,
I'm going to enroll

17:06.126 --> 17:08.328
the kids in one of them
fancy Swiss boarding schools.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.963
And then with all that alimony--

17:11.064 --> 17:12.365
I guess I'll quit
my job and just

17:12.465 --> 17:15.468
lay around watching soap operas
on my brand new big screen TV.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.439
What you going to do?

17:19.539 --> 17:20.707
Oh hell, I guess,
the kids are gone,

17:20.807 --> 17:22.509
I'll come over to your
place and watch football.

17:22.609 --> 17:26.346
[audience laughing]

17:26.446 --> 17:27.247
Yeah?

17:27.347 --> 17:30.617
Over my pit bull's dead body.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.884
I just wanted
to say good night,

17:31.984 --> 17:32.819
and give you my new number.

17:32.919 --> 17:33.720
Oh great.

17:33.820 --> 17:34.721
I'll call you.

17:34.821 --> 17:35.655
Great.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.424
And I also wanted
to say, thanks.

17:37.524 --> 17:38.691
What for?

17:38.791 --> 17:40.627
Well, you probably
don't know it,

17:40.727 --> 17:43.363
but you're the one who
inspired me to go to college.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.198
- She did?
- Oh, yeah.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.967
Patsy, are you trying
to pin your divorce on me.

17:48.067 --> 17:48.868
No.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.937
I pin that on Bob.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.872
Anyway, do you
remember the barbecue?

17:52.972 --> 17:55.142
You told me how you were
going to be a writer.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.710
And you had all these
dreams and plans,

17:57.810 --> 17:58.845
and nothing was
going to stop you.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.980
Yeah.
I do remember that.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.815
Well, it got me to thinking.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.351
If nothing's going
to stop Roseanne,

18:04.451 --> 18:06.853
then nothing is
going to stop me.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.455
I just wanted to tell you that.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.523
Well, I'm glad I could help.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.724
Well, Phil's waiting.

18:11.824 --> 18:12.625
I got to go.

18:12.725 --> 18:13.560
It was great seeing you.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.727
Great seeing you too, Patsy.

18:14.827 --> 18:15.628
Take care, Patsy.

18:15.728 --> 18:16.496
Bye.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.036
Well, you and Patsy must've
had some talk at that barbecue.

18:24.137 --> 18:24.937
Yeah.

18:25.037 --> 18:26.273
You men missed it.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.241
You were all off talking about
the proper way of stacking

18:28.341 --> 18:29.609
charcoal briquettes.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.978
[audience laughing]

18:32.078 --> 18:34.614
Rosie, you never told me you
still thought about writing.

18:34.714 --> 18:35.748
Yeah.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.784
I think about that, and
I think about traveling.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.420
You know there's lots of
stuff I still want to do.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.255
Oh.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.490
Does that bother you?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.792
No.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.527
Well, you've
got a lot of stuff

18:47.627 --> 18:48.995
you want to still do too, right?

18:49.095 --> 18:49.996
Sure.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.699
Well?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.534
I mean-- you know--

18:54.634 --> 18:58.104
what if what you want to
do isn't what I want to do?

18:58.205 --> 19:02.242
Well, we would
work it out somehow.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.510
What if we can't?

19:03.610 --> 19:05.845
I mean, you wouldn't pull
no Patsy on me, would you?

19:05.945 --> 19:07.013
You mean, walk out?

19:07.113 --> 19:09.182
Yeah.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.917
Dan, I'm here because
I want to be here.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.852
I'm not going no place.

19:12.952 --> 19:13.753
I love you.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.559
What about down the line?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.060
Well, we don't know
what's going to happen.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.630
But whatever would happen,
we will work it out together.

19:23.730 --> 19:24.531
Yeah.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.333
I guess so.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.569
Oh face it, this marriage
is like a life sentence

19:29.669 --> 19:31.671
with no hope for parole.

19:31.771 --> 19:37.176
[audience laughing]

19:37.277 --> 19:38.077
Want to dance?

19:42.749 --> 19:44.617
I thought you'd never ask.

19:50.657 --> 19:53.526
[piano music playing]

20:31.764 --> 20:34.934
Aw, look at that.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.803
Aren't they cute?

20:36.903 --> 20:39.739
I wonder if we get hold
of an all night taxidermist.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.941
[audience laughing]

20:42.041 --> 20:43.142
Don't turn it off.

20:43.242 --> 20:46.446
You'll wake them up.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.848
Should we take
the kids upstairs?

20:48.948 --> 20:50.617
You want to carry
them up there?

20:50.717 --> 20:51.618
No.
Do you?

20:51.718 --> 20:52.519
No.

21:09.669 --> 21:10.470
Let's go to bed.

21:21.548 --> 21:22.649
I really had fun.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.317
Me too.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.253
Sure hope I can see you again.

21:27.354 --> 21:30.122
I can't because I'm happily
married and madly in love

21:30.222 --> 21:31.324
with my husband.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.526
Is he bigger than me?

21:33.626 --> 21:34.894
Must be a lucky guy.

21:34.994 --> 21:35.895
Yeah.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.765
He better not ever
forget it either.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.801
