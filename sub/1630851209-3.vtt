Nandor!

00:04.352 --> 00:05.622
Nandor! (groans)

00:05.655 --> 00:07.559
Where the fuck is Nandor?

00:09.462 --> 00:11.399
Nandor has taken to

00:11.432 --> 00:13.671
slipping away from the house
at odd times recently.

00:13.704 --> 00:15.340
Which is very annoying for me,

00:15.374 --> 00:16.810
'cause, unfortunately,

00:16.844 --> 00:19.482
I need his help with
an extremely crucial task:

00:19.516 --> 00:21.787
updating the Vampiric Council's
website.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.691
I don't even know
what a website is.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.327
I thought it was
something to do with spiders.

Nandor. Nandor...

00:33.310 --> 00:34.378
But I think I know why.

00:35.480 --> 00:36.449
He's been disappearing

00:36.482 --> 00:38.453
to the penny pornos.

00:38.486 --> 00:40.658
Penny porno is a room in town

00:40.692 --> 00:42.696
where men pay a cent
to sit next to each other

00:42.729 --> 00:45.133
and whack off.
Why would he lie about that?

00:45.167 --> 00:47.338
I wouldn't care; I'd tell
everyone that's where I go.

00:47.371 --> 00:49.509
In fact,
I've just come back from there.

00:49.543 --> 00:52.248
GUILLERMO:
I honestly have no idea
where he's been going.

00:52.281 --> 00:54.385
Knock, knock. Coming in.

00:54.418 --> 00:56.155
I should know where's he at
at all times. I'm his bodyguard.

where he's going.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.512
COLIN:
So we've decided to follow him.

01:07.545 --> 01:08.814
Me, personally,

01:08.848 --> 01:10.250
I couldn't give a shit
where he goes.

01:10.284 --> 01:12.154
But I don't want
the others to think

01:12.187 --> 01:15.695

Of course,
there were my 37 wives,

02:34.786 --> 02:36.322
but they mostly hated me.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.326
Anyway, I had a dry spell

02:38.360 --> 02:40.430
for about 200 years.

02:40.464 --> 02:42.736
And then I met Gail.

02:42.769 --> 02:45.207
We have been what
you might call off and on

02:45.240 --> 02:47.612
over the past 30, 40 years.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.916
But I simply cannot keep away.

of tropical fruits,

bearing the image of
musical poet Robert Seger.

02:59.836 --> 03:02.474

is strawberry vanilla crunch.

Guillermo! Have you still got

Yes, you do!

‐Great.
‐That's my fridge.

What's‐‐ What do you
need that for?

03:13.463 --> 03:14.833
‐What's all this shit?
‐That's medicine.

03:14.866 --> 03:16.870
I need to keep that
refrigerated‐‐ It's fine.

03:16.904 --> 03:18.974
The doctor said there might be
side effects if I don't.

03:19.008 --> 03:21.580
‐Don't be such a snowflake.

03:21.613 --> 03:22.849

‐It's for Gail.

03:28.527 --> 03:30.397
Gail.

03:30.430 --> 03:31.867
Of course I'm happy for my
master. Why wouldn't I be?

03:31.900 --> 03:33.771
But, as his bodyguard,
it is my job

03:33.804 --> 03:36.543
to personally vet anyone
that he spends time with.

03:36.577 --> 03:38.581
And that's exactly
what I'll do.

03:38.614 --> 03:40.785
Nandor, we really need to make
a decision on these fonts.

03:40.818 --> 03:42.454
I like Helvetica,

03:42.488 --> 03:44.225
'cause it's the name of
one of the prostitutes

03:44.258 --> 03:45.862
for the donkeys in my village
and they were friendly.

03:45.895 --> 03:48.299
‐What do you think?
‐About what?

03:48.333 --> 03:49.603
The fonts for
the Vampiric Council website.

03:49.636 --> 03:50.905
I mean, we could do
Franklin Gothic,

03:50.938 --> 03:52.374
but it's a bit on the nose.

03:52.408 --> 03:53.410
Not now, Nadja, please.

03:53.443 --> 03:54.913
Gail is coming over tonight.

03:54.946 --> 03:56.617
NADJA:
Yes, we are familiar

03:56.650 --> 03:58.954
‐with Gail.
‐Now you're taking a risk there,

03:58.988 --> 04:01.392
'cause my wife hates Gail
more than anyone in the world.

04:01.426 --> 04:03.396
I have no issue with Gail.

04:03.430 --> 04:04.866
What I have a problem with

04:04.900 --> 04:06.436
is every time her and Nandor
get back together,

04:06.469 --> 04:08.273
she gets his hopes up

04:08.306 --> 04:09.576
that he can turn her
into a vampire

04:09.609 --> 04:10.945
and they can be together
for eternity.

04:10.978 --> 04:12.381
And then she always says "no"

04:12.414 --> 04:13.751
and then he always
gets heartbroken.

04:13.784 --> 04:15.788
It's the same thing
over and over again

04:15.822 --> 04:17.458
for the past 40 years.

04:17.492 --> 04:19.996
It really breaks my heart
to see him like this.

04:20.030 --> 04:22.569
All right, all right,
my darling.

04:22.602 --> 04:24.038
I mean, we all know
you hate the woman.

04:24.071 --> 04:26.008
That much is clear.

04:26.042 --> 04:28.480
I like her!

04:28.514 --> 04:30.250
Ah, I may as well tell you.

04:32.655 --> 04:35.026
Oh... for fuck's sake.

04:35.060 --> 04:36.497
Is that what I think it is?

04:36.530 --> 04:38.501
No, it's not,
you little pervert.

04:38.534 --> 04:40.838
It's an engagement ring.

04:40.872 --> 04:43.443
I'm going to give it
to Gail this evening,

04:43.476 --> 04:45.915
then I'm going to turn her
into a vampire,

04:45.948 --> 04:47.919
then we are going to be
together for eternity.

He's been down there for hours,

04:51.025 --> 04:52.962
desperately trying
to find out what he can

04:52.996 --> 04:54.966
about the origin
of energy vampires.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.570
Between you and I, though,

04:56.603 --> 04:58.306
I wouldn't normally spend
this much time with him,

04:58.339 --> 04:59.776
but I figured the quicker
he gets on with it,

04:59.810 --> 05:01.312
the quicker
he'll shut his mouth.

05:01.345 --> 05:03.884
I mean, there's tons
of stuff down here

05:03.918 --> 05:05.788
about regular vampires,

05:05.822 --> 05:07.725
but almost nothing
about energy vampires.

it's been impounded.

miners across state lines.

I always wondered
where they hid it away

06:08.614 --> 06:11.385
and it's been right under
my nose the entire time.

06:11.419 --> 06:13.156
What else do you want to know?

06:13.189 --> 06:15.661
One Yoplait here
and then two up there.

06:15.695 --> 06:16.964
How did you get this ring?

06:16.997 --> 06:19.034
I killed some virgins
the other night,

06:19.068 --> 06:20.705
and one was wearing
a promise ring.

he's going to keep.

not while Gail's around.

06:41.813 --> 06:43.149

Agree with what?
I didn't say anything.

08:00.103 --> 08:02.240
‐you know, the one in marketing?
‐So talented.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.944
GAIL:
Oh, God.

08:03.977 --> 08:06.048
Well, her ex is just taking
her to the cleaners.

08:06.082 --> 08:08.887
And then this, on top of
the rain that we've been having,

08:08.921 --> 08:11.058
‐it's like, "Ah!" You know?
‐NADJA: Ah.

08:11.092 --> 08:12.829
Too much water.

08:12.862 --> 08:14.164
‐GAIL: Too much.
‐You need a yogurt.

08:14.198 --> 08:17.572
‐I got your favorite.
‐GAIL: Oh, boy.

08:17.605 --> 08:19.943
‐A yogurt!
‐(Nandor vocalizing)

08:22.147 --> 08:24.586
‐LASZLO: You like that?
‐COLIN: I do like that.

08:24.619 --> 08:26.623
Nice, hey? Feel her curves.
She's a beaut.

08:26.656 --> 08:28.560
Ah, yeah. What's it run on?

08:28.594 --> 08:30.531
Petrol and coal.

08:30.564 --> 08:32.234
‐Hybrid.
‐You might say.

08:32.267 --> 08:33.937
It's called a Stutz Laszlo.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.142
They only made four.
They gave one to Henry Ford

08:36.175 --> 08:39.114
and then he gave his one
to his hero, Mussolini.

08:39.148 --> 08:41.586
That... seems about right.

08:41.620 --> 08:42.889
‐Right.
‐(engine sputters)

08:42.922 --> 08:44.859
‐(revs)
‐Whoa‐ho!

08:44.893 --> 08:46.128
‐Did you hear that?
‐Yeah.

08:46.162 --> 08:47.732
Come on, man,
let's go for a ride.

08:47.765 --> 08:48.901
We can go wherever you want.

08:48.934 --> 08:51.005
Montenegro,
Cote d'Azur.

08:51.038 --> 08:52.675
‐You name it.
‐Buffalo?

08:52.709 --> 08:53.677
Let's do it.

08:53.711 --> 08:55.046
Yeah, all right.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.650
‐Yes! Now we're talking.
‐Sounds kind of fun.

08:56.683 --> 08:58.620
‐A little adventure.
‐Yeah.

08:58.654 --> 09:00.891
COLIN:
Energy vampires love
a good road trip.

09:00.925 --> 09:04.164
I, myself, always have
my mix ready to go.

09:04.198 --> 09:05.768
25 "Hey There Delilahs."

09:05.801 --> 09:08.139
Oh, and I have my trail mix.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.843
Not to eat, of course,

09:09.876 --> 09:12.749
but to shove into
the crevices of the seats.

09:12.782 --> 09:16.055
Shit. I'm gonna need you
to help me get it out of here.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.059
Okay, just come back,
just a little.

09:18.092 --> 09:19.829
What's the problem?

09:19.863 --> 09:22.067
Um, there's a block down here.
Let me get it.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.606
‐(screeching)
‐(Colin screaming)

09:24.639 --> 09:25.908
(Colin coughs)

09:25.941 --> 09:27.645
What the hell?

09:27.678 --> 09:29.582
‐Did I get you?
‐Did you get‐‐ Yeah.

09:29.616 --> 09:32.154
I have no reflection
in the rearview mirror.

09:32.187 --> 09:34.291
You don't, but I do. I reflect.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.761
Okay.

09:35.795 --> 09:37.364
Don't think the room
is big enough.

09:37.397 --> 09:39.602
‐I don't think
we can get it out.
‐I think they

09:39.636 --> 09:41.940
built this around the car.

09:41.973 --> 09:43.242
It was built around it?

09:43.276 --> 09:44.879
Around the car!

09:44.913 --> 09:47.083
‐I‐I have a crazy idea.
‐What?

09:47.117 --> 09:48.219
‐Are you in?
‐(engine banging)

09:48.252 --> 09:49.789
‐Right.
‐What?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.325
No! (grunts)

09:51.358 --> 09:53.329
Shit. Sorry, man.
Did I get you?

09:53.362 --> 09:54.632
‐(choking): Back up.
‐Do what?

09:54.666 --> 09:55.734
Back up.

09:55.768 --> 09:56.937
I don't know if it can do that.

09:56.970 --> 09:59.141
Reverse, you shithead.

09:59.174 --> 10:01.780
(quietly):
I wanted to ask Gail something,

10:01.813 --> 10:03.717
but I wanted to go
and get something

10:03.750 --> 10:05.921
that I want to give her
when I ask her that something,

10:05.955 --> 10:08.059
so maybe if you just stay here
and keep her company,

10:08.092 --> 10:09.729
I can go and do that

10:09.762 --> 10:11.833
and maybe towel off
my, uh, face and genitals.

10:11.867 --> 10:13.937
Uh... Fine.

10:13.971 --> 10:15.641
‐Yes? Thank you.
‐(chuckles) Yes.

10:15.674 --> 10:17.244
I'll leave you guys to it;
I'll be back in a sec.

10:17.277 --> 10:19.782
Thank you. Oh, Guillermo!

10:19.816 --> 10:22.053
Have you seen my genital towel?

10:22.087 --> 10:23.857
‐Guillermo.
‐Ah!

10:23.891 --> 10:25.093
We're just‐‐ we're just
watching Twilight, see?

10:25.126 --> 10:26.797
‐Where is the ring?
‐What?

10:26.830 --> 10:28.967
The ring in the box! For Gail.

10:29.001 --> 10:30.938
‐Is this it?
‐Give me that!

10:30.971 --> 10:32.875
And I am borrowing this towel.

10:32.909 --> 10:34.278
That's my favorite sweater.

10:35.246 --> 10:36.683
‐LASZLO: It's simple.
‐Mm? All right.

10:36.716 --> 10:38.052
We take the car apart here,

10:38.085 --> 10:40.356
move it outside,
then reassemble it there.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.229
How long did you own this car
before it was taken from you?

10:43.262 --> 10:45.768
‐About ten minutes.
‐Oh. Then‐‐ All right.

10:45.801 --> 10:48.139
LASZLO:
I haven't spent much time
with Colin Robinson

10:48.172 --> 10:50.043
in the past,
for the main, obvious reason

10:50.076 --> 10:52.047
that he's incredibly
fucking dull.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.884
If you buy a German car,

10:53.917 --> 10:55.888
you're basically
supporting the Nazi party.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.257
LASZLO:
I don't know. Maybe

10:57.290 --> 10:58.894
I've gone soft in my old age,

10:58.927 --> 11:01.131
but I've noticed that
he looks a bit lonely.

11:01.165 --> 11:03.069
I thought I'd spend
some time with him.

11:03.102 --> 11:04.873
I mean, you could call it
my good deed.

11:04.906 --> 11:06.275
You're not masturbating,
are you?

11:06.308 --> 11:07.879
COLIN:
You know, I've never really

11:07.912 --> 11:11.018
spent much time
with Laszlo before.

11:11.051 --> 11:14.726
With Nadja being away so much
with her Council duties,

11:14.759 --> 11:18.065
I've decided to take pity
on the poor guy.

11:18.099 --> 11:20.905
I‐I think
he just needs a friend.

11:20.938 --> 11:22.440
You've got to keep notes
as I'm talking,

11:22.474 --> 11:24.177
otherwise it'll all go to shit.

11:24.211 --> 11:25.446
Well, I'm trying to keep up

11:25.480 --> 11:26.983
with all these parts
you're making up.

11:27.017 --> 11:28.352
‐What is this?
‐I don't know.

11:28.386 --> 11:30.390
A wiggabuhbiggle is
what you called it.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.828
The man knows his cars.

11:34.231 --> 11:36.168
Yeah, actually, I used to think

11:36.202 --> 11:38.172
that my parents
were energy vampires,

11:38.206 --> 11:40.009
but I‐I don't know anymore.

11:40.043 --> 11:42.380
My dad was really dynamic
and outgoing,

11:42.414 --> 11:44.886
kind of a RuPaul type,

11:44.919 --> 11:46.188
but in the '20s.

11:46.222 --> 11:47.858
And my mom, I...

11:47.892 --> 11:49.896
I don't really remember
my mom anymore.

11:49.929 --> 11:52.000
(clangs)

11:52.033 --> 11:53.971
Did you mum die
when you were young?

11:54.004 --> 11:56.743
Nah, she was just boring.
Still is.

11:56.776 --> 11:58.747
Is this the bonus pile
or is that?

11:58.780 --> 12:00.751
I'll be honest.
At this point,

12:00.784 --> 12:02.487
I don't think it really matters.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.525
‐I had a mother once.
‐Oh?

12:04.559 --> 12:05.895
What‐what was she like?

12:05.928 --> 12:08.132
No idea.
I was raised by my nanny,

12:08.165 --> 12:10.871
who used to make me
learn Latin in the nude.

12:10.905 --> 12:12.909
‐Oh.
‐I quite liked it.

12:12.942 --> 12:15.480
♪ ♪

12:20.390 --> 12:22.060
(glass shatters)

12:22.093 --> 12:24.197
(cloth ripping)

12:32.047 --> 12:33.951
‐Oh. Are you leaving?
‐Yeah. It's getting late

12:33.984 --> 12:36.221
and I really want to get
back to my condo

12:36.255 --> 12:37.825
for Grey's Anatomy.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.929
I think Nandor is going
to ask you something

12:39.963 --> 12:44.071
stupid, pathetic, and, uh,
get rejected again, as usual.

12:44.104 --> 12:46.977
(laughs) Nandor knows
that Thursday nights

12:47.010 --> 12:48.947
are for the gals.

12:48.981 --> 12:51.218
Meaning me and Meredith Grey.

12:51.251 --> 12:53.222
But, uh, tonight is,
uh, Saturday.

12:53.255 --> 12:55.126
It's what?

12:55.159 --> 12:57.498
Tonight is not Thursday,
tonight is Saturday.

12:57.531 --> 12:59.836
Excuse me, sweetie,
you are on my slacks.

12:59.869 --> 13:01.506
Oh. I just think Nandor
will be down

13:01.539 --> 13:03.442
‐in just a little, tiny,
one little moment...
‐I gotta go.

13:03.476 --> 13:05.848
Gail! Wait! Oh, I want to talk
to you about Nandor.

13:05.881 --> 13:07.852
We can have a
girlie to girlie conversation.

13:07.885 --> 13:10.023
‐There's not a lot
to talk about, really.
‐Gail!

13:10.056 --> 13:13.362
Wait. Wait! There is a bloody
plunket of a man upstairs

13:13.396 --> 13:15.501
who has feelings, and those
feelings are going to get hurt

13:15.534 --> 13:17.370
and then we will never
choose a font!

13:17.404 --> 13:19.107
‐Gail!
‐(distorted voice):
Get away from me!

13:19.141 --> 13:20.310
‐(growls)
‐Gail?

13:20.343 --> 13:22.380
(howling)

13:22.414 --> 13:24.451
(growling, groaning)

13:24.484 --> 13:27.090
Fuckin' hell. Oh!

13:29.328 --> 13:30.864
So many nipples.

13:30.898 --> 13:32.233
(snarls)

13:33.202 --> 13:34.539
Shoo! Shoo!

13:34.572 --> 13:36.408
(roars)

13:36.442 --> 13:38.580
Oh, Nandor, what have you done?

13:40.584 --> 13:43.155
I'll be completely honest
with you,

13:43.189 --> 13:45.995
I've never done an actual
car reassembly before.

13:46.028 --> 13:48.165
‐Yeah, no shit, my beauty.
‐(horn honks)

13:48.199 --> 13:49.936
What the fuck, you two?

13:49.969 --> 13:52.207
Do you know what kind of
damage you've done

13:52.240 --> 13:54.144
to some of our
most priceless artifacts

13:54.177 --> 13:56.281
with this jackass stunt
of yours?

13:56.315 --> 13:58.052
A good evening to you, too.

13:58.085 --> 14:00.456
‐We may have bumped
into a few things.
‐(scoffs)

14:00.490 --> 14:02.962
You shattered
the crystal blood chalice

14:02.995 --> 14:05.033
of Vlad the Impaler himself!

14:05.066 --> 14:08.940
You left an enormous dent in
the sarcophagus of Amen‐Ra,

14:08.974 --> 14:12.313
‐and you tore
the Shroud of Urine!
‐COLIN: Wait, wait.

14:12.347 --> 14:14.919
There's a Shroud of Turin
in there?

14:14.952 --> 14:17.457
No. The Shroud of Urine.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.294
It is a completely
different thing

14:19.327 --> 14:21.065
and even more valuable.

14:21.098 --> 14:22.935
And it is ruined!

14:22.968 --> 14:24.639
What you're failing
to understand

14:24.672 --> 14:27.444
is the ball ache that
we both had trying to get this

14:27.477 --> 14:30.216
from inside there to out here.

14:30.249 --> 14:32.353
That would make
a lot of sense to me,

14:32.387 --> 14:35.627
if there wasn't
a giant red button.

14:35.661 --> 14:37.063
(alarm blares)

14:37.097 --> 14:41.004
Ah, the magic of
mechanical garage doors.

14:41.038 --> 14:44.010
COLIN:
Yeah, okay.
But how were we supposed to see

14:44.044 --> 14:47.217
the big red button
when we were inside?

14:47.250 --> 14:49.121
You're right.
A couple of idiots inside

14:49.154 --> 14:51.258
couldn't see
the other red button?

14:51.291 --> 14:53.362
That says "push to open"?

14:53.396 --> 14:55.133
‐Fuck it!
‐(alarm blares)

14:55.166 --> 14:58.540
Have fun! I've got to go call
the insurance people!

14:58.573 --> 15:00.944
They're gonna rip me apart.

15:04.251 --> 15:06.956
Well, I think I'm gonna
head home and do my research

15:06.990 --> 15:08.259
‐from there for a while.
‐No, hang on.

15:08.292 --> 15:09.962
I can give you a lift,
if you like.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.100
‐Yeah, sure, that sounds fun.
‐(chuckles)

15:12.133 --> 15:13.637
You'll have to top her up,
though.

15:13.670 --> 15:15.674
‐Can do.
‐(chuckles)

15:16.743 --> 15:18.045
LASZLO:
Right.

15:18.078 --> 15:19.247
‐You ready to roll?
‐Yeah.

15:19.281 --> 15:20.450
(horn honks)

15:20.483 --> 15:22.120
‐Let's do it.
‐(engine sputters)

15:22.153 --> 15:24.157
(sputtering)

15:24.191 --> 15:27.263
(screaming)

15:27.297 --> 15:28.265
Shit.

15:28.299 --> 15:29.635
(screaming)

15:29.669 --> 15:31.438
Just kidding. I'm fine.

15:31.472 --> 15:33.677
I'm fine.
It's just a little fire.

15:33.710 --> 15:35.279
(laughs)

15:35.313 --> 15:37.383
NADJA:
Honestly, of all the things!

15:37.417 --> 15:40.156
You have really pissed all over
our pips this time, Nandor.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.262
Okay, yes. My Gail happens
to be a werewolf.

15:43.295 --> 15:45.667
‐(hisses)
‐But when we met,
she was still a human.

15:45.701 --> 15:48.540
She's only recently been turned
in a werewoman.

15:48.573 --> 15:51.345
Which is the proper term
for a female werewolf.

15:51.378 --> 15:53.149
And you knew this,
and you didn't tell us.

15:53.182 --> 15:55.419
‐Well...
‐I defended that woman

15:55.453 --> 15:56.589
against my wife's jealousy.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.994
I don't dislike Gail!

15:59.027 --> 16:01.265
But this, me old chap,
is a bridge too far.

16:01.298 --> 16:03.068
Are you insinuating

16:03.102 --> 16:06.543
that I would do it with her
while she is in wolf form?

16:06.576 --> 16:09.281
Because I did,
but I was in bat form.

16:09.314 --> 16:11.553
And it was exclusively
hand stuff.

16:11.586 --> 16:13.557
We are the leaders
of the Vampiric Council.

16:13.590 --> 16:16.295
How do you think it looks
that one of our own

16:16.328 --> 16:18.165
is porking our mortal enemy!?

16:18.199 --> 16:20.436

Correct answer, Guillermo.

becoming a vampire

shows her his lipstick,
