WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:03.873
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,
we've reached our destination.</i>

00:03.916 --> 00:06.876
<i>Welcome to New York City.</i>

00:06.919 --> 00:09.313
- Taxi!

00:14.579 --> 00:17.234
- Legends, we made it!

00:33.076 --> 00:35.165
Legends, we made it!

00:35.209 --> 00:36.862
- Thanks, we heard
you the first time.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.125
- And every other time.

00:38.168 --> 00:39.735
- I appreciated
all your updates.

00:39.778 --> 00:40.997
- Thanks.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.956
Uh, Nate and Zari
aren't coming?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.480
What are they doing?
Did they say something?

00:45.523 --> 00:47.134
- Hoover-Bot's
still stonewalling us,

00:47.177 --> 00:48.526
so they're tinkering,

00:48.570 --> 00:50.093
trying to figure out
who sent him.

00:50.137 --> 00:52.052
Why are you so concerned?
- I'm not concerned.

00:52.095 --> 00:55.142
I'm just, you know, emotionally
invested in their love story.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.013
- I can't believe we're finally
in New York.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.189
We're so close to getting
a time machine and going home.

00:59.233 --> 01:00.930
- Okay, first, we got to find
Dr. Gwyn Davies.

01:00.973 --> 01:02.540
So let's get a city map,
yeah?

01:02.584 --> 01:04.542
- Can we also please find
some pizza or something

01:04.586 --> 01:06.153
that's not John's whiskey?

01:06.196 --> 01:08.894
- Ooh! I saw an ice-cream stand
near the park.

01:13.986 --> 01:16.380
- Oh, I miss classic
New York pizza.

01:16.424 --> 01:18.382
It's all squash blossoms
and cauliflower crust

01:18.426 --> 01:19.862
in 2044.
- Yeah.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.342
Why couldn't John's
manor dimension

01:21.385 --> 01:24.127
have had unlimited Pizza Shack?

01:24.171 --> 01:27.783
- Manor dimension? 2044?

01:27.826 --> 01:29.480
Pizza Shack?

01:29.524 --> 01:31.482
Where--where are you kids from?

01:31.526 --> 01:34.355
- Oh, um, we're just
tourists from--

01:34.398 --> 01:36.879
- Uh, Canada, eh?

01:36.922 --> 01:39.621
Sorry, how much
do we owe you?

01:39.664 --> 01:43.494
- You're not Canadians.
Canadians are good people.

01:43.538 --> 01:45.714
You're outlaws.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.672
And I'm gonna stop you.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.991
- Come here, come here.
-

02:02.034 --> 02:04.602
- Careful, careful.
-

02:04.646 --> 02:05.690
Okay.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.216
Okay, I'm fine.
I got the map.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.956
Let's just get to the manor.

02:19.487 --> 02:22.054
- Whatever you're doing
back there, you can't hurt me.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.883
I'm impervious to pain.
- Oh, I believe it.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.366
- Wow, You mastered
that Hoover tech real quick.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.325
- Yeah, well, the code is
the same as the Waverider's.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.588
In fact, you see
this blue chip?

02:33.631 --> 02:35.764
We have chips like this
all over the Waverider.

02:35.807 --> 02:38.201
- So, we can confirm
that the Waverider

02:38.245 --> 02:41.291
who shot our Waverider
is making the Hoover-Bots.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.206
But the question
is still who and why.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.860
- Yeah.
Well, if this computer

02:44.903 --> 02:47.036
I stole from John's attic
wasn't so retro,

02:47.079 --> 02:48.646
I would have
the answer to that.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.300
- I was sent by the
United States Government

02:50.344 --> 02:52.128
to uphold the law.
- Hmm.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.869
- He still thinks
he's the real Hoover?

02:53.912 --> 02:56.698
- Yeah, I even put up a mirror
to show him his tech.

02:56.741 --> 02:59.091
He accused me of subversion.

02:59.135 --> 03:02.399
- You deserve a break.
- Doughnuts?

03:02.443 --> 03:04.184
Where'd you get doughnuts?

03:04.227 --> 03:05.750
- John's attic.
Kidding.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.143
Gary stole them off the train.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.407
- Ah, genius!

03:10.451 --> 03:12.844
Oh, my God, Sara!
- I'm fine.

03:12.888 --> 03:14.759
We got too casual,
forgot the Bullet Blondes

03:14.803 --> 03:15.891
are still front-page news.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.109
Not gonna happen again.

03:17.153 --> 03:18.198
- Yes, you might be fine,

03:18.241 --> 03:19.503
but I'm finding it very hard

03:19.547 --> 03:20.852
to erase the image of my wife

03:20.896 --> 03:22.680
being shot
by a trigger-happy local.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.247
- Sounds more like a patriot
to me.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.944
- Can we mute him?

03:25.988 --> 03:27.859
I can't deal with his
negative energy right now.

03:27.903 --> 03:30.079
- Yeah, gladly.

03:30.122 --> 03:33.430
- Sounds like an American hero.
Sounds like some--

03:33.474 --> 03:35.476
- Okay, so...

03:35.519 --> 03:37.652
Have you and Zari
talked next steps?

03:37.695 --> 03:39.175
- No.
I don't know what to say.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.785
And I don't want
to ruin the vibe.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.309
- You're ruining the vibe
by not saying anything.

03:42.352 --> 03:43.962
This is last time
I sneak you train doughnuts.

03:44.006 --> 03:45.660
- The hell you will.
You're my doughnut dealer.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.401
- Hey.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.229
What are you two
whispering about?

03:49.272 --> 03:51.231
- Oh, uh...
The mission.

03:51.274 --> 03:53.015
The Bullet Blondes
are still front-page news,

03:53.058 --> 03:54.886
and we got to find this
Dr. Davies as fast as we can.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.714
- He's right.

03:56.758 --> 03:59.064
And we located Edison Labs,
which is where Davies worked

03:59.108 --> 04:01.066
when he came up with
the foundation for time travel.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.416
- Great.
Just get us his research,

04:02.459 --> 04:03.765
and we'll use
our future knowledge

04:03.808 --> 04:05.201
to build
what he's come up with.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.116
Then we can time travel
out of 1925.

04:07.159 --> 04:09.074
- Wonderful.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.207
While you regain your strength,
I'll go get Davies' research.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.383
- Actually, I'm going.
You're staying.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.646
- What? No way.
You just got shot.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.300
- Babe, our faces are literally

04:17.344 --> 04:19.650
on the front
of every single newspaper.

04:19.694 --> 04:22.174
If someone recognizes us again
and decides to take a shot,

04:22.218 --> 04:24.046
I'm the only one who's gonna
be able to survive that.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.831
- Fine.
But no footprints.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.703
Davies is the father
of time travel.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.835
If you mess up his timeline,
no amount of IOUs

04:30.879 --> 04:32.054
in the world can fix it.

04:32.097 --> 04:34.143
- You got it.
-

04:34.186 --> 04:36.885
- Which one's Davies?

04:36.928 --> 04:38.452
- No clue.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.497
Time Bureau Manual didn't have
a picture of him.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.978
- Oh.

04:43.021 --> 04:45.589
- But if I had to guess,
I'd say that guy.

04:45.633 --> 04:46.851
- Looks familiar.

04:46.895 --> 04:50.246
Kind of like Mick
but with hair?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.117
- I was thinking
more of a young Stein.

04:52.161 --> 04:54.598
But regardless, he's clutching
his briefcase to his chest

04:54.642 --> 04:56.557
like it has
something important in it.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.341
- Basis of time travel?
- Mm-hmm.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.343
Wait here.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.650
Um, excuse me, Dr. Gwyn Davies?

05:02.693 --> 05:05.174
- That's Dr. Gwyn Davis.
What is it you want?

05:05.217 --> 05:08.133

05:12.181 --> 05:13.791

some very important discoveries

05:13.835 --> 05:15.184
for Mr. Edison.

05:15.227 --> 05:17.142
Now excuse me. Thank you.
- Of course.

05:17.186 --> 05:20.276
Ooh!
Oh, I am so sorry.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.105
Oh, by the way, was that
an accent that I detected?

05:23.148 --> 05:24.846
- Good day to you.
- Oh, um...

05:24.889 --> 05:26.326
keep up the good work.

05:30.504 --> 05:33.420

Hello! I'm Gideon.

an interpretation

How can a spell generate that?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.855

anything?

All I know is it works.
Spooner.

07:11.648 --> 07:14.129

07:14.172 --> 07:16.174
- These blueprints
are incredible.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.350
It's like Da Vinci's
helicopter sketch.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.744
- Okay, how long to build
the time ship?

07:20.788 --> 07:22.833

are really thorough.

I'd say four--no, five.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.534

07:27.577 --> 07:30.624
- Uh, years.
- Five years?

a time machine

07:33.061 --> 07:35.019

07:35.063 --> 07:36.934

get back to 2021.

07:36.978 --> 07:39.328
- Look, it's not impossible.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.330
It's just gonna

And at least we have

We can't use it yet.

no offense.

a tiny footprint

all the information.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.507
For instance,
this is very interesting.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.988
The Manual says that Davies
laid the foundation

09:58.032 --> 09:59.076
for time travel.

09:59.120 --> 10:00.730
If he built a time machine,

10:00.774 --> 10:02.645
why doesn't it say
that he invented time travel?

10:02.689 --> 10:04.560
- All right, maybe
he time-traveled somewhere,

10:04.604 --> 10:06.344
couldn't recharge,
and got stuck there.

10:06.388 --> 10:07.519
- Oh, that makes sense.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.956
That's why he never got credit,

10:08.999 --> 10:10.871
because no one
ever knew he succeeded.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.786
- But if we time-travel to the
future, we can recharge it.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.266
Plus, we'll pick up some time
couriers, and we'll get back,

10:15.310 --> 10:18.661
and we'll return the machine,
and he'll be none the wiser.

10:18.705 --> 10:22.622
Babe, we would have
time travel again.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.841
And I know it's a footprint,
but it's a tiny footprint.

10:24.885 --> 10:26.495
It's like a baby footprint.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.497
And everyone loves
baby footprints.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.503
- The clutch is slipping.

10:34.546 --> 10:36.113
- I have no idea
what that means.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.854
But I assume it's bad.
Can you fix it?

10:37.898 --> 10:39.508
- No, there's no time,
and we won't be able

10:39.551 --> 10:41.336
to get out of first gear.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.381
So, like, the max we can go
is, like, 20 miles per hour.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.209
- How fast do we need to drive
to get to New York?

10:45.253 --> 10:46.950
- Well, to prevent the Legends
from blowing up

10:46.994 --> 10:48.909
in Davies' time machine
due to electrical overload,

10:48.952 --> 10:50.562
we should maintain
a conservative pace

10:50.606 --> 10:52.564
of no less than
55 miles per hour.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.958
- Maybe we can, I don't know,
find a mechanic.

10:56.351 --> 10:57.918
- There's no need.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.702
We got our lucky rock.
Remember?

10:59.746 --> 11:01.965
- I'm still not convinced
there's any such thing as luck,

11:02.009 --> 11:04.315
only the ability to cope
with the statistical universe.

11:04.359 --> 11:07.275
- Ah, you'll see.
Watch.

11:09.930 --> 11:13.629
Come on, rock,
bring us some more luck.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.472
- Good afternoon, ladies.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.213
Name's Erwin George Baker,

11:32.256 --> 11:34.128
but you can call me
Cannon Ball.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.651
- Cannon Ball?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.871
As in the cross-country
race-car driver?

11:37.914 --> 11:39.350
- You've heard of me?

11:39.394 --> 11:41.396
- I'm a big NASCAR--
I mean racing fan.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.661
Well, y'all wouldn't happen
to know the fastest route

11:45.705 --> 11:47.576
through Cleveland,
now, would you?

11:47.619 --> 11:49.273
I'm actually in the middle of
trying to break my own record

11:49.317 --> 11:51.623
driving from L.A.
to New York.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.583
And, well,
I think I made a wrong turn.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.237
- New York, did you say?

11:57.586 --> 11:59.066
We're actually
on our way there, too.

11:59.109 --> 12:00.850
- Well, the fastest route
to New York

12:00.894 --> 12:02.722
is south on Highway 15
till it merges with Highway 40,

12:02.765 --> 12:05.768
then cut through Columbus,
not Cleveland, on the 90.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.773
You sure know
your directions, miss.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.775
I'll tell you what--

12:12.819 --> 12:15.038
if y'all help me
get to the highway,

12:15.082 --> 12:18.955
I'll let you race with me
all the way to New York.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.740
- Shotgun.
- All right!

12:20.783 --> 12:22.611
- Let's go.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.179
- Oh, I love scavenger hunts.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.920
Are we playing teams
or head-to-head?

12:26.963 --> 12:29.183
- Neither. You're on your own
finding that part.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.750
- Well, what are you gonna do?

12:30.793 --> 12:32.403
- Make sure that the doc
stays here all night.

12:32.447 --> 12:33.796
We can't have him walking in

12:33.840 --> 12:35.232
on us building
his time machine, right?

12:35.276 --> 12:37.191
- How you gonna keep him here?

12:37.234 --> 12:38.845
- Uh...

12:42.022 --> 12:44.154
- Hmm.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.638
-
I told you,

12:49.681 --> 12:51.988
I am not here to socialize,
young lady.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.816
Thank you.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.600
I beg your pardon.

12:55.644 --> 12:56.601
What do you think
you are doing?

12:56.645 --> 12:57.689
You see, this is my desk.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.561
It is not a rubbish tip.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.432
- Oh, you didn't hear?

13:01.476 --> 13:03.043
They want your opinion

13:03.086 --> 13:06.829
on which of these projects
is best by tomorrow?

13:06.873 --> 13:09.310
- Yes.
Who wants it?

13:09.353 --> 13:10.920
Not Edison.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.617
- Oh, this...

13:12.661 --> 13:14.663
came straight
from Edison himself.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.884
Oh, and these.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.668
Tomorrow.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.458
- What do we have here?

13:33.769 --> 13:37.338
I truly am the world's
greatest scavenger hunter.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.822
- I should be out there.
- Sara's gonna be fine.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.171
She's a half-alien ninja

13:44.214 --> 13:45.607
in a building
full of scientists.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.261
- An illegal alien?

13:47.304 --> 13:48.958
You degenerates
are worse than I thought.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.394
- Would you just shut up?

13:50.438 --> 13:51.613
You're not even
the real Hoover.

13:51.656 --> 13:52.962
You are a robot.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.790
If you would just tell us
who sent you

13:54.834 --> 13:56.487
and who blew up our Waverider,
we could be rid of you.

13:56.531 --> 13:57.880
- You can't get rid of me.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.708
I'll hunt you
until my dying breath.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.666
- Shh!

14:01.710 --> 14:04.060
I still don't know who sent him
or who blew up the Waverider.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.976
But I did find a to-do list
in his programming.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.805
- Tax convention at 3:00 p.m.?
- I'm missing that?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.460
You'll pay for this.

14:12.503 --> 14:16.029
- Uh, there's an item that
supersedes everything else.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.643
Oh.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.734
- Wait, so, if he's here
to kill us

14:25.777 --> 14:27.997
but he's also here
to replace the old Hoover

14:28.041 --> 14:29.694
and do everything
that the old Hoover did,

14:29.738 --> 14:31.740
does that mean that the person
that wants us dead

14:31.783 --> 14:33.655
is trying to protect
the timeline?

14:33.698 --> 14:35.265
- Why would someone
who's trying to protect

14:35.309 --> 14:36.919
the timeline
want us dead?

14:36.963 --> 14:39.052
Protecting the timeline
is literally our job.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.358
- I don't know,
but any noticeable footprints,

14:41.402 --> 14:42.882
and they'll know
that it's us

14:42.925 --> 14:45.058
and they'll come back
to finish the job.

14:48.975 --> 14:53.980
- Have you seen Dr. Parker?
- Um, no?

14:54.023 --> 14:57.070
- You must be new.
I'm Mr. Edison.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.594
- Edison?
T-Thomas Edison?

14:59.637 --> 15:01.770
- What's your name?
- Gary Green.

15:01.813 --> 15:04.773
Dr. Gary Green.

15:04.816 --> 15:08.081
- Well, Dr. Green,
at Edison Labs,

15:08.124 --> 15:11.562
we log out parts
from the Parts Department.

15:11.606 --> 15:12.737
- Oh.

15:12.781 --> 15:15.175
Let me show you.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.568
Who's your supervisor?
- Uh, Dr. Gwyn Davies.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.309
- Davies?
- Mm-hmm.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.832
- What project is this for?

15:20.876 --> 15:23.661
- Oh, his time-travel project,
of course.

15:26.838 --> 15:29.580
- Have security meet me
at Davies' office.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.495
<i>- Yes, sir.
Right away.</i>

15:35.021 --> 15:36.283
- Uh...

15:38.198 --> 15:40.069
- What Edison's asking me
to do,

15:40.113 --> 15:41.810
it will keep me here all night.

15:41.853 --> 15:45.553
- I suggest
you get started, then.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.163
- Out of the night
that covers me,

15:47.207 --> 15:49.600
black as the pit from pole
to pole--

15:49.644 --> 15:50.906
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.907
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.737
- Hey.
Are you all right?

15:55.780 --> 15:58.827
- Yeah, please.
Just don't touch me.

15:58.870 --> 16:01.221
- Confiscate everything.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.005
- No, no, no.
No, not my work.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.093
No, you--

16:08.445 --> 16:10.056
- I've told you,

16:10.099 --> 16:13.624
this time travel
is a fool's errand.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.844
But you've been drafting
blueprints at work

16:15.887 --> 16:17.672
and stealing company parts.

16:17.715 --> 16:20.631
- Just let me complete it,
Mr. Edison, please.

16:20.675 --> 16:23.765
I beg of you.
- You're terminated, Davies.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.028
These men will escort you
off the premises.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.509

burning this.

16:28.552 --> 16:31.033

Time travel
is my divine mission.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.472
You can't take
that away from me!

16:35.516 --> 16:36.865
- Take him to Bellevue.

16:36.908 --> 16:39.737
It's apparent
he's lost his damn mind.

16:39.781 --> 16:41.217
- I'm perfectly sane.

16:41.261 --> 16:44.003
You get your hands off me,
you brutes!

16:44.046 --> 16:45.656
Get your hands off me!

17:01.716 --> 17:04.023

You are making a huge mistake.

Erwin's cross-country races
are all over the newspapers.

21:17.058 --> 21:20.017
Wait, they disappeared
when I put this in.

21:20.061 --> 21:23.238
So, if I take it out--

21:23.282 --> 21:25.153
Why aren't they back?
-

21:25.196 --> 21:26.894
Because we caused
too many footprints.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.199
God, this is all my fault.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.071
- Okay,
why are we still here?

21:30.114 --> 21:31.420
- I don't know.

21:31.464 --> 21:34.249
But look, if Ava and--
if they're gone,

21:34.293 --> 21:36.904
then that means that
the Time Bureau never existed.

21:36.947 --> 21:39.341
That means that...

21:39.385 --> 21:41.648
Which means
that I never meet Ava.

21:43.650 --> 21:44.955
We need to fix this.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.392
We need to cover
all of our footsteps

21:46.435 --> 21:47.871
and make sure that history

21:47.915 --> 21:49.786
happens exactly
how it's supposed to.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.527
Stay here and uninstall
that last part.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.355
- We're not gonna use
the time machine?

21:53.399 --> 21:55.531
- No, we will, but we need
Davies to install it

21:55.575 --> 21:58.621
and take his maiden voyage
like history intended.

21:58.665 --> 22:00.841
- Wait, you're gonna break him
out of a mental institution?

22:00.884 --> 22:02.277
- Yeah, I guess so.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.366
Oh, wait.
Edison took all of his files.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.715
- It's all good.
We made a copy.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.456
- No, no, no.
It's not all good.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.892
It was the originals that were
passed down from history,

22:08.936 --> 22:10.416
and it's the originals
that inspired

22:10.459 --> 22:11.808
the invention of time travel.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.375
We have to get those back
from Edison.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.377
- Okay, it's a lot to do,
but it's not impossible.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.813
- We have until 7:00 p.m.

22:16.857 --> 22:18.641
- That's a little
more impossible.

22:18.685 --> 22:22.297
- Then it's time
for all hands on deck...

22:22.341 --> 22:25.300
human and robot.

22:27.041 --> 22:29.130
Hey, you guys muted him.

22:29.173 --> 22:31.262
Can you get him to do
or say things?

22:31.306 --> 22:32.742
- I mean, he has a to-do list.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.614
In theory, I could replace
what's on it.

22:34.657 --> 22:37.399
- Replace it. We need him to
get Davies' plans from Edison.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.749
And Edison's gonna be
more likely to give the plans

22:39.793 --> 22:42.491
to Hoover than he would to us.
- Okay.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.711
Bye-bye, eliminate legends.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.321

22:49.237 --> 22:51.413
- You know, I don't know
why I keep unmuting you.

22:51.457 --> 22:53.415
- All right, I'm gonna
grab some clothes

22:53.459 --> 22:55.156
so we can accompany Hoover.

22:55.199 --> 22:57.027

John has in that attic.

22:57.071 --> 22:58.942
- Hey.

he has a lab coat?

23:15.437 --> 23:17.091

23:17.134 --> 23:18.484
No, no, no, no, no, no.

23:18.527 --> 23:19.702

23:19.746 --> 23:20.921
- Getting you
out of here.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.749
The fangirl stuff
was just an act.

23:22.792 --> 23:24.838

23:24.881 --> 23:26.317
-
"Time traveler"?

23:26.361 --> 23:28.276
Is this some kind
of sick joke?

23:28.319 --> 23:29.930
Edison put you up to it,
didn't he?

23:29.973 --> 23:31.845
The blasphemer!
- This isn't a joke, all right?

23:31.888 --> 23:33.281
I'm from 2021.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.196
And I know that
you invented time travel

23:35.239 --> 23:37.764

23:37.807 --> 23:39.505

23:39.548 --> 23:41.507

your time machine--let's go.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.378

to believe

23:43.422 --> 23:44.945
a word that's coming out
of your mouth?

23:44.988 --> 23:47.338
You lied to me!
This is all just more lies!

23:47.382 --> 23:49.210
- Shh! Come on.
You'll see when you get there.

23:49.253 --> 23:50.820

anywhere with you.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.256
- No.
Listen, you don't understand.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.867
- I don't think you understand.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.783
I built my time machine
for a sacred purpose.

23:56.826 --> 23:59.394
And I'll be damned if I'm
letting a two-bit liar use it.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.961
- We do not have time for this,
all right?

24:01.004 --> 24:02.789
If you don't come with me,
then history is--

24:02.832 --> 24:05.444

24:05.487 --> 24:09.360
You see, I am not going

Guard!

24:11.362 --> 24:13.234

24:14.627 --> 24:15.976
Shh!

24:17.717 --> 24:19.414
Be quiet.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.942
- Shh.
- Okay.

24:25.986 --> 24:29.511
- Now, I will let you go
if you stop screaming.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.991

24:31.034 --> 24:34.342

24:36.431 --> 24:38.128

All right, hey, hey.

24:38.172 --> 24:39.956
It's all right.
Hey, look--

24:40.000 --> 24:42.306
Calm down, you're
having a panic attack, okay?

24:42.350 --> 24:44.526
You just need to focus
on your breathing.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.920
- Okay, okay.

24:52.142 --> 24:53.404
- Okay, look.

24:53.448 --> 24:56.712
Hey, hey.
I'm sorry, okay?

24:56.756 --> 25:00.368
I've been treating you like
a pawn instead of a person,

25:00.411 --> 25:02.065
and it's not fair.

25:02.109 --> 25:05.242
You--you are a really big deal,
all right?

25:05.286 --> 25:08.071
Hey, you invented
freakin' time travel,

25:08.115 --> 25:11.074
and it's because of you that
so many things become possible,

25:11.118 --> 25:13.468
including me meeting my wife.

25:14.991 --> 25:17.124
- You married a woman?

25:17.167 --> 25:19.169
- Yeah.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.389
Still getting used
to saying that.

25:21.432 --> 25:22.912
We just got married.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.396
Look, I messed up, and...

25:28.439 --> 25:30.529
and she disappeared
from the timeline.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.661
And so now I have a sacred
purpose, too--

25:32.705 --> 25:34.402
to bring her back.

25:34.445 --> 25:36.622
And the only way
that that could happen

25:36.665 --> 25:38.624
is if you come with me,

25:38.667 --> 25:42.976
or otherwise
she could be gone forever.

25:43.019 --> 25:45.152
So, please,
believe me when I say

25:45.195 --> 25:47.154
that I am done lying to you.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.595
- I can understand
doing anything

25:53.639 --> 25:56.380
to save the person you love.

25:56.424 --> 25:59.862
It's actually why I was trying
to invent time travel.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.260
- So let's do it.
What do you say?

26:06.303 --> 26:07.870
Help me save my person?

26:11.657 --> 26:14.442
- If I help you save
your person,

26:14.485 --> 26:16.487
you'll help me save mine?

26:16.531 --> 26:19.229
- Uh, you're only gonna come
with me if I say yes, right?

26:19.273 --> 26:21.623
- Uh-huh.
We have a deal, then.

26:24.844 --> 26:26.759
Let's get the hell out of here.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.544

26:32.808 --> 26:34.288
- I don't know, Zari.

26:34.331 --> 26:36.246
He's still giving me
"Terminator" vibes.

26:36.290 --> 26:39.075
- Listen, I hear that,
but he's on our side now.

26:39.119 --> 26:40.642
I reprogrammed him

26:40.686 --> 26:42.949
to get Edison's plans,

to make that less toothy?

he was being pulled

29:01.478 --> 29:06.266

32:06.011 --> 32:09.318
our lucky rock,
and now Gideon.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.758
Unless you can swim faster
than a blue marlin,

32:14.802 --> 32:17.674
we're gonna lose the rest
of our friends, too.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.159
- Ooh, there are a lot more

32:24.203 --> 32:26.031
of you than I thought there
would be.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.468
- This is only half the crew.
Wait till you meet the rest.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.165
Hey, everybody.

32:30.209 --> 32:33.908
I'd like to introduce you
to Dr. Gwyn Davis.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.823
- Nice to meet
your acquaintance.

32:35.866 --> 32:39.392
Ah, there she is.
- Ah, yes.

32:39.435 --> 32:43.831
My divine mission is finally
coming to "fruititions."

32:43.874 --> 32:45.398
- Hey, man.
I'm Behrad.

32:45.441 --> 32:48.053
Oh, sorry.
I just feel like I know you.

32:48.096 --> 32:50.098
I mean, I've been studying
your life's work

32:50.142 --> 32:52.753
and chilling in your apartment
and using your glassware.

32:52.796 --> 32:55.974
I borrowed a glass, by the way.
Hope that's cool.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.541
- Uh, hey, is that--

32:58.585 --> 33:00.630
- Oh, yeah.

33:00.674 --> 33:03.155
Also, uh, Edison's dead.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.157
- What?

33:05.200 --> 33:07.855
- So there's another Hoover-Bot
and now an Edison-Bot deployed.

33:07.898 --> 33:11.032
But headline--there's a rogue
Waverider after us.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.556
- But we did get the plans.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.732
- Oh, my files.
Thank you so much.

33:15.776 --> 33:18.648
- You know, you really
do look familiar.

33:18.692 --> 33:21.651
- Oh, maybe I just have
one of those faces.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.436
- Ray.
He looks like Ray.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.090
- My Ray?
- I said a young Stein.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.092
But whatever, we got the plans,
we got the doc.

33:27.135 --> 33:28.615
B!

33:30.051 --> 33:31.357
- You got to assemble
the last part

33:31.400 --> 33:32.923
to get the timeline
back on track.

33:32.967 --> 33:34.447
- Ah, yes.

33:34.490 --> 33:37.537
The final piece of the puzzle.

33:41.106 --> 33:43.195
You ready?

33:43.238 --> 33:45.327
- Oh, come on, come on.

33:53.727 --> 33:55.555
Ava. Oh!
- Wha--

33:55.598 --> 33:57.078
what happened?

33:57.122 --> 33:59.254
Did I disappear?

33:59.298 --> 34:01.648
- It worked!
- I am so sorry.

34:01.691 --> 34:04.259
I never should have rushed.
I should have listened to you.

34:04.303 --> 34:06.087
- Oh, no, no.
It's okay.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.698
What matters is that
we're back together again.

34:08.742 --> 34:09.699
Oh.
Oh, oh.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.179
No, no.
No.

34:11.223 --> 34:12.615
- Is this not
a group-hug situation?

34:12.659 --> 34:14.443
- Right, well, uh,

34:14.487 --> 34:17.490
it'll be a bit of a squeeze,
but I'm sure we all can fit.

34:17.533 --> 34:20.710
- Oh, all right.
What do you say, guys?

34:20.754 --> 34:22.277
Ready to go home?

34:24.410 --> 34:27.587
- Here, do another luck spell.
Maybe we can still make it.

34:27.630 --> 34:29.502
- I can't.

34:29.545 --> 34:31.591
The spell was fake.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.027
- Come again.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.898
- There is no luck spell.
I made it up.

34:34.942 --> 34:36.813
I pretended to do it
to make you feel better

34:36.857 --> 34:38.119
and give you back some hope.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.555
You were
at a pretty low point.

34:39.599 --> 34:41.209
- Okay, well, then how
do you explain

34:41.253 --> 34:44.125
where all the luck came from?
- It came from us.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.735
Hey, no.
Think about it.

34:45.779 --> 34:48.260
You felt better
after I did the spell, right?

34:48.303 --> 34:50.305
Gideon convinced Erwin
to give us a ride.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.525
I sweet-talked the cop
into letting us go.

34:52.568 --> 34:55.528
We made our own luck,
and we can keep making it.

34:55.571 --> 34:57.138
But we have to do it fast

34:57.182 --> 35:01.142
because we only have
five minutes to stop them.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.971
- Or do we stop everything?

35:04.014 --> 35:05.668
Let's go.

35:18.377 --> 35:21.554
- Oh, hello.

35:21.597 --> 35:24.339
- Who the heck are you?
- I'm Gideon.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.341
- Well, Gideon, you got
to the count of three

35:26.385 --> 35:29.388
to get out of my new car,
or I'm gonna make you.

35:29.431 --> 35:31.390
One, two--

35:34.175 --> 35:37.091
- By my calculations,
there's still enough time

35:37.135 --> 35:40.573
to save my friends...
with luck.

35:44.838 --> 35:47.057
- Right, then, where to?

35:47.101 --> 35:48.755
- We need to go somewhere
we can get back

35:48.798 --> 35:50.800
to our time machine
and find the rest of our crew.

35:50.844 --> 35:52.498
- Tahiti, 2021.

35:52.541 --> 35:53.890
There's a Time Bureau
safehouse there.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.023
We can go pick up
some time couriers.

35:56.066 --> 35:59.940
- And sounds like
a great honeymoon. Hmm?

35:59.983 --> 36:02.203
- Tahiti would be
an amazing honeymoon.

36:02.247 --> 36:04.162

ladies, but...

36:04.205 --> 36:06.773
After you have
got the rest of your friends,

36:06.816 --> 36:08.818
you will hold up
your end of the deal.

36:08.862 --> 36:11.212
- I always keep my word.
- Deal? What are you--

36:11.256 --> 36:13.997
What--you know what?
Nope, I don't even care.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.956
It's been a crazy day.
I disappeared.

36:15.999 --> 36:18.828
I don't want to know anything.
Don't tell me anything.

36:18.872 --> 36:21.483
- Um, you should
know one thing.

36:21.527 --> 36:24.356
Um, we also killed Edison.
