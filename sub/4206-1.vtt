Unless we can catch one of them,
we may have no choice.

34:45.074 --> 34:49.786
We don't have much of a budget.
lt's not a high priority in Washington.

All I did was negotiate.

JACK: l cut us a deal.

35:43.212 --> 35:47.425

36:12.741 --> 36:15.869
You're still here, aren't you?
l'd say you're up to it.

36:25.169 --> 36:27.796
So, Mr. Gummer, what do you think?

36:33.970 --> 36:35.387
Fish or cut bait.

Of course, you could squander
the taxpayers' money...

...but l can get a graboid to swallow this...

37:10.337 --> 37:13.090
...with this, for $49.95.

37:13.674 --> 37:16.468

...or whatever fits
your plausible deniability.

37:23.183 --> 37:26.644
l don't understand what you just said,
but do we have a deal?

37:28.729 --> 37:30.731
Because we want to know
what we should do.
