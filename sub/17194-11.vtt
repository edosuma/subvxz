00:02.040 --> 00:02.917
<i>I'm sorry, Eva,</i>

00:02.920 --> 00:04.035
<i>you'll be prosecuted
for murder.</i>

00:04.280 --> 00:06.431
We'll start
organizing your defense.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.557
About my shop window.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.276
Relax.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.597
The only qualifying
bid that remains

00:16.600 --> 00:18.592
<i>is that of
General Brendan Donovan.</i>

00:18.600 --> 00:21.434
<i>General Donovan has
presented us with offers</i>

00:21.440 --> 00:24.638
for each of the properties
we own in Five Points.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.438
Donovan is going to level
his own ward?

00:26.440 --> 00:30.116
You're chasing two stale cases,
Bartlett and Ramsey?

00:30.120 --> 00:32.919
Are you coverin'
for him? For Donovan?

00:32.920 --> 00:34.877
<i>I got your one Teresa
Trembley in hiding,</i>

00:34.880 --> 00:37.190
<i>but tonight Donovan ordered me
to silence her.</i>

00:37.200 --> 00:39.192
Teresa!

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

01:43.280 --> 01:45.351
Hey!

01:45.360 --> 01:47.795
What the hell's the matter
with you two?!

01:50.920 --> 01:52.036
Agh!

01:52.040 --> 01:55.238
<i>Ungh! My god,
what are you doing?!</i>

01:55.240 --> 01:57.197
<i>Joe, you goddamn prick!</i>

01:57.200 --> 01:59.237
Don't leave me here alone
with these animals!

01:59.240 --> 02:01.391
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

02:01.400 --> 02:03.198
Take whatever you want!

02:03.200 --> 02:05.795
<i>You want money?
I got money!</i>

02:06.200 --> 02:08.715
Take it!
Leave me be, please!

02:08.720 --> 02:09.949
<i>One tiny crack on the head</i>

02:09.960 --> 02:12.077
and this bastard's
already quivering.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.390
A shame he don't got
five or six of his pals here

02:14.400 --> 02:16.676
to help him out, huh?

02:18.960 --> 02:21.794
The sixth precinct don't
take kindly to mobs

02:21.800 --> 02:24.952
dispensing whatever it is
they consider "justice."

02:24.960 --> 02:26.155
But--!

02:26.160 --> 02:28.834
I don't care
if you're a negro,

02:28.840 --> 02:30.354
a chinaman,
or an asshole like you,

02:30.360 --> 02:31.919
the only beatings allowed
in this neighborhood

02:31.920 --> 02:34.674
are comin' from our fists,
understand?

02:34.680 --> 02:36.160
Yeah.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.560
You better.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.631
Otherwise, we'll come back here
each and every week

02:44.640 --> 02:47.109
to remind you
of this little lesson.

02:51.240 --> 02:52.754
Matthew?

02:52.760 --> 02:53.910
Come to bed.
It's late.

02:53.920 --> 02:55.240
Ah, just a little
while longer.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.037
Matthew, you haven't been
getting near enough sleep

02:59.040 --> 03:00.554
these past few days.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.517
I know, and I can,
I will,

03:02.520 --> 03:06.116
but right now I'm close
to finding something

03:06.120 --> 03:09.158
that could treat
this unknown bacteria.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.719
Couldn't it wait
until morning?

03:10.720 --> 03:14.509
I said I'll come to bed
when I am finished!

03:17.520 --> 03:19.113
Goodnight!

03:42.960 --> 03:46.192
How can a man
take the life of a young girl,

03:46.200 --> 03:49.034
discard her body
like a piece of trash?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.119
I...

03:54.280 --> 03:56.875
I couldn't say,
Mister Trembley,

03:57.520 --> 04:00.797
but we're doin' everything
we can to find her killer.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.834
You said that
she came to you.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.275
You were supposed
to protect her.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.313
You're just as responsible
for her death

04:08.320 --> 04:11.119
as the monster
who did the deed.

04:11.120 --> 04:15.114
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't mean to--

04:15.120 --> 04:17.237
Leave us in peace!

04:18.760 --> 04:21.149
I'd tell you and the rest
of the godless savages

04:21.160 --> 04:24.358
inhabiting this city
to go to hell,

04:24.560 --> 04:25.994
but you're already there.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.035
She was a beautiful girl.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.517
I grieve for your loss.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.592
All right,
bring in the jury.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.109
<i>Sheisse.</i>

05:15.640 --> 05:16.994
Oh, excuse me.

05:18.240 --> 05:21.392
- Hey there.
- Oh, hello, uh, detective.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.390
Corcoran.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.392
It's Billy, ain't it?
Donovan's new clerk.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.073
Yes, sir,
I'm on my way in now.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.117
Oh! I'm headin'
there myself. I'll walk with ya.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.998
Love to hear how the general's
been treating you.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.753
I'm, uh, runnin' late, actually.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.672
It's a gorgeous day out, well...

05:33.680 --> 05:35.399
...a few extra minutes
won't kill ya.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.836
Is there any particular reason

06:14.840 --> 06:17.275
you're standing in the middle
of my office, Detective?

06:17.600 --> 06:20.035
Yeah, captain had a message
for ya.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.679
<i>Uh...</i>

06:21.920 --> 06:23.479
New kid wasn't here.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.472
Figured I'd just leave it
on your desk.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.071
I appreciate
your attentiveness.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.233
Mornin', General.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.952
<i>Your concerns are noted, father.</i>

06:51.960 --> 06:53.633
Yet here you persist.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.440
Thus the beauty of our
"business" relationship.

06:56.440 --> 06:57.840
You provide me with analysis,

06:57.840 --> 07:00.309
which I then choose
to ignore or heed.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.279
You have yet to heed
any of my suggestions.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.431
If you are dissatisfied,

07:05.560 --> 07:07.870
feel free to head off
and farm greener pastures.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.314
I've made my decision.

07:09.320 --> 07:11.198
You're a fool, Robert!

07:11.200 --> 07:12.350
Perhaps.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.272
But displacing thousands
of immigrants

07:14.280 --> 07:16.840
is no longer a business
I hold interest in.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.911
Our properties
will not be sold

07:18.920 --> 07:21.480
to aid Donovan
and his aqueduct.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.790
The city will then simply
take our properties

07:23.800 --> 07:24.995
through eminent domain,

07:27.360 --> 07:29.079
than our current offer!

07:29.080 --> 07:33.313
You have always lamented
my lack of principles, father.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.880
Take comfort knowing
that I finally found some.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.837
Not your lack of principles,
Robert,

07:37.840 --> 07:39.832
your lack of practicality.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.551
I need it set up
in the music room, James.

07:45.560 --> 07:47.756
Yes, ma'am, I'll see to it.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.672
You're not leaving already?!

07:50.040 --> 07:52.191
I've hardly seen you
all morning.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.715
Then you probably
shouldn't sleep the day away, dear.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.916
I have wonderful plans for us.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.192
<i>I'm to be your muse.</i>

07:59.280 --> 08:02.318
<i>As compelling as that
sounds, I have business to attend to.</i>

08:02.320 --> 08:04.516
<i>Oh business, business.
So much time for work,</i>

08:04.520 --> 08:06.637
so little time for play...

08:07.760 --> 08:09.831
...least of all your wife.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.799
Who knows,

08:11.800 --> 08:13.757
you may even be interested
in my work,

08:13.760 --> 08:16.150
crusading to aid
the downtrodden,

08:16.160 --> 08:18.629
a cause for which you used
to care a great deal.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.632
Fortunately, you've made it
quite clear in the past

08:20.640 --> 08:22.950
that my interest in your work
is not welcome.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.195
I'll be back later.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.396
Try and stay
conscious today.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.635
Brian, bloody
Christ Almighty, knock it off!

08:48.640 --> 08:49.960
<i>Detective!</i>

08:49.960 --> 08:52.953
So you think you can just
come and go as you please?

08:52.960 --> 08:54.872
Don't know what you mean,
Captain.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.315
Your attendance has been
sparse this past week.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.640
So you're either
shirking your duty

08:58.640 --> 09:00.791
or working a case
off-book.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.359
Neither, sir.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.636
I know what
you've been up to, Corcoran.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.040
Those yardsticks
who laid a beating

09:06.040 --> 09:08.157
on your doctor friend?

09:08.160 --> 09:11.471
I'm told that you decided
to send a message to them.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.470
Right.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.949
I just felt I should remind them
of their place,

09:14.960 --> 09:16.474
who's really in charge here.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.631
Yes, it's an important
lesson to remember.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.634
Corcoran.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.075
Double the weekly taxes
on their store

09:25.080 --> 09:26.070
while you're at it.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.471
I can't abide vigilantes
roaming my streets!

09:35.600 --> 09:37.398
Donovan's clerk Billy
doesn't know anything.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.232
You find something of interest
in the office?

09:39.240 --> 09:40.230
A wall safe.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.357
Donovan came in before I could
get a good look at it though.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.396
Did he make you?

09:43.400 --> 09:44.550
Nah, I don't think so.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.472
I was just tellin' Andrew
about the Trembleys.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.312
<i>Mother and father weren't
very keen on talkin'.</i>

09:48.320 --> 09:49.720
Pretty torn up.

09:49.720 --> 09:50.836
I suppose the doctors
didn't give you

09:50.840 --> 09:52.069
anythin' else to go by?

09:52.080 --> 09:53.070
Nah, just what we knew:

09:53.080 --> 09:55.072
Poor girl was strangled,
her body dumped.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.151
And at a renderin'
plant, for chrissake.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.679
<i>I can't believe
he just walks in here,</i>

10:09.680 --> 10:12.275
struttin' like he ain't got
a care in the world.

10:12.280 --> 10:13.316
And he'll keep struttin'

10:13.320 --> 10:15.437
unless we can find
physical evidence

10:15.440 --> 10:16.430
tying him to the crimes.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.035
Donovan ordered Lansing
and Teresa killed.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.430
I heard him give the order
with my own ears.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.352
Whose words
are gonna be believed?

10:23.360 --> 10:24.430
A murderous,
crooked cop,

10:24.440 --> 10:26.716
or a devoted public servant,
hero of the ward?

10:26.720 --> 10:28.154
<i>You come forward,
it won't be Donovan's ass</i>

10:28.160 --> 10:29.150
they throw in the tombs.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.913
You really wanna go back there?

10:31.960 --> 10:35.840
We need something
concrete to bring Donovan down.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.750
See if Freeman will take a look
at Teresa's body.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.797
Maybe he'll uncover
some evidence we missed.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.839
Us? What about you?

10:44.840 --> 10:46.877
I'm gonna swing down
to the courthouse.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.872
I ain't gonna lose another name
to Donovan's ledger.

10:58.880 --> 10:59.870
Alderman, please.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.109
The passion is appreciated,

11:01.120 --> 11:02.349
but we have delayed long enough!

11:02.360 --> 11:03.840
A few more days.
Give me until Friday.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.593
I'm sorry.
The vote will happen tonight.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.716
The public's health
is not something--

11:06.720 --> 11:09.918
If and when the project
is awarded to Mister Donovan,

11:09.920 --> 11:13.391
you can take your concerns
directly to him.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.793
This court is in recess.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.631
I missed you
in my cheering section.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.553
I'm working other
avenues outside the courtroom.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.914
How's the trial going?

11:42.920 --> 11:43.990
Oh, it's a gas.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.993
The judge is having me over
for tea this weekend.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.957
It's going like
I expected,

11:48.960 --> 11:50.155
a room full of stodgy men

11:50.160 --> 11:52.231
detailing what I did wrong
in my life.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.594
At least you have
a good lawyer.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.274
Pfft! I'd rather have
my business back.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.273
Christ himself
couldn't sway these people.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.235
Don't worry.
I'll figure this out.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.717
Sure you will.

12:06.440 --> 12:09.751
I'm not gonna
lose anyone else.

12:10.520 --> 12:11.510
One way or another,

12:11.520 --> 12:13.113
you and I are gonna walk
outta these doors,

12:13.120 --> 12:14.520
I swear.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.671
Lord help the man that gets
in your way, copper.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.273
Do me a favor...
send Richie over, will ya?

12:26.280 --> 12:28.158
I got an errand for him.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.278
<i>Grab your bag, Freeman,
time to work some magic.</i>

12:34.280 --> 12:35.270
Excuse me,
gentlemen?

12:35.280 --> 12:37.875
We got a dead body
needs lookin' at.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.759
Sorry, but I'm in the
middle of an experiment.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.037
Then ya can experiment later.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.795
No.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.150
What's that?

12:48.160 --> 12:49.196
I said no.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.873
You'll have to find
someone else!

12:50.880 --> 12:53.475
Corky said he needed ya
to look at a body for us.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.790
And I often help him
when I choose to do so.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.599
<i>But right now I'm in the middle
of something more important.</i>

13:00.720 --> 13:03.394
Ah, what then,
you want a coupla bucks?

13:06.120 --> 13:07.474
You'll leave me alone.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.756
How difficult is that
for you to understand?

13:09.760 --> 13:11.433
Jesus,
no need to be a prick.

13:11.440 --> 13:12.430
Say that again.

13:12.440 --> 13:15.035
Easy now.
Francis didn't mean nothin' by it.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.474
We just figured,

13:16.480 --> 13:18.437
after we went outta our way
to help with that shopkeeper--

13:18.440 --> 13:19.920
I didn't ask you to do that.

13:19.920 --> 13:20.910
No. Even so--

13:20.920 --> 13:21.910
And don't pretend
as if you did it

13:21.920 --> 13:24.355
outta the kindness
of your heart!

13:24.760 --> 13:26.752
When was the last time you,
any of you,

13:26.760 --> 13:29.434
helped a black man
who'd been attacked?!

13:29.440 --> 13:31.955
One who wasn't friends
with Kevin Corcoran?

13:32.360 --> 13:35.080
I don't owe either of you,
or Kevin for that matter,

13:35.080 --> 13:37.117
a goddamn thing!

13:37.600 --> 13:40.069
Solve your own case
for a change.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.277
You know,
you got some nerve.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.430
Hmm?

13:43.440 --> 13:44.794
Come on, Andrew.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.792
<i>Let's go.</i>

13:58.000 --> 13:58.990
Agghhhh!

14:15.160 --> 14:17.720
<i>Ten cents a quart!</i>

14:18.200 --> 14:21.671
<i>Oh, I didn't leave.
Uh, I...</i>

14:34.880 --> 14:37.156
<i>So why would a
wealthy fellow buy a business</i>

14:37.160 --> 14:38.992
<i>only to keep the place closed?</i>

14:39.000 --> 14:42.072
I don't know.
What do you want with me?!

14:42.080 --> 14:43.116
<i>I need you to tell me</i>

14:43.120 --> 14:45.316
<i>what you're really up to
with Donovan.</i>

14:45.320 --> 14:47.312
<i>Look, if I say anything,</i>

14:47.320 --> 14:49.630
<i>I am liable to end up
a dead man!</i>

14:49.640 --> 14:50.835
<i>If you don't say anything,</i>

14:50.840 --> 14:52.832
<i>death ain't likely,
but assured.</i>

14:52.840 --> 14:55.753
<i>All right, all right,
all right!</i>

14:59.000 --> 15:01.993
Look, I'm not some
big to-do.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.117
Yeah, I don't have
any real money.

15:05.520 --> 15:10.197
I'm just a face,
a name that they put on paper,

15:11.480 --> 15:13.199
a front for
the real property owners

15:13.200 --> 15:15.760
who need to keep their name
out of public record.

15:15.760 --> 15:18.320
Donovan pays you
for this service?

15:21.840 --> 15:24.400
Him and a few others.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.036
So Donovan bought
The Paradise?

15:27.040 --> 15:29.635
No, he arranged it
for someone else.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.236
Then who secretly
owns Eva's?

15:37.480 --> 15:40.951
Some uptown millionaires.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.552
The Morehouse family.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.596
Mmm... The light.

16:08.120 --> 16:11.750
You have the most exquisite
skin, dear,

16:11.760 --> 16:14.070
like mottled alabaster.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.198
<i>Thank you, ma'am.</i>

16:16.200 --> 16:18.237
<i>If possible,
could I get up now?</i>

16:18.240 --> 16:20.755
<i>No, no, no, no,
not quite yet.</i>

16:20.760 --> 16:22.752
Just a little bit longer.

16:24.680 --> 16:27.514
Inspiration hath no clock.

16:39.640 --> 16:40.915
Come over here
for a moment, Elizabeth,

16:40.920 --> 16:42.115
I wish to show you something.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.634
What is it?

16:43.840 --> 16:45.115
Quite the eye-opener.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.840
Hmm...Oops!

16:48.840 --> 16:50.638
You've piqued my interest.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.040
In here.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.796
I don't see anything.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.919
The time has come
to clean you up, dear!

17:00.920 --> 17:02.593
How dare--!

17:08.680 --> 17:11.992
No!

17:17.599 --> 17:20.115
How dare you?!

17:26.960 --> 17:28.952
You got a visitor.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.190
He say what he wants?

17:30.200 --> 17:32.032
Nah. Just that
it was important.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.674
Anything from Freeman?

17:33.880 --> 17:35.439
He turned us down.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.797
I think he's dealin'
with his own problems.

17:38.200 --> 17:38.917
Join the club.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.195
Yeah.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.633
I take it this ain't
a social visit?

17:47.640 --> 17:49.518
Serious matters,
I'm afraid.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.240
Involving Donovan?

17:51.240 --> 17:53.232
How prescient, Corky.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.229
Major, I ain't interested in anything

17:56.240 --> 17:57.959
you and Donovan have to say.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.792
I'm done being manipulated
by rich assholes

17:59.800 --> 18:01.712
who take what don't
belong to 'em.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.552
I'm afraid you've lost me.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.114
You ever gonna tell me
about your family

18:06.120 --> 18:08.476
purchasing buildings
in Five Points?

18:08.480 --> 18:10.711
It's true, we have,
for quite some time.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.554
And then you swept in
and snatched up Eva's

18:13.560 --> 18:14.676
<i>when she was vulnerable.</i>

18:14.680 --> 18:18.276
Technically, father bought it
at Donovan's suggestion.

18:18.280 --> 18:19.714
Then why didn't
you stop them?

18:19.720 --> 18:21.473
Because I didn't know
about Eva's myself

18:21.480 --> 18:23.790
until I went through
some of father's files.

18:23.800 --> 18:24.950
Truthfully, Corky,

18:24.960 --> 18:27.634
The Paradise is the least
of your worries.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.552
Donovan has grand plans
to build the new aqueduct

18:33.560 --> 18:34.550
for the city.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.756
You, your friends,
your neighbors,

18:36.760 --> 18:38.911
this building,
are in the way.

18:38.920 --> 18:39.956
If the plans go through,

18:39.960 --> 18:42.759
Eva's and half of Five Points
will be razed!

18:43.880 --> 18:46.111
So Donovan turns
on his own people.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.316
Power and money
are great motivators.

18:48.320 --> 18:52.234
The construction contract alone
is a windfall.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.880
Add to that,
any deals he's cut...

18:54.880 --> 18:56.917
Like deals with
property owners,

18:56.920 --> 18:58.673
hiding their purchases
with other names.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.070
Projects like these
take a lot of land,

19:01.080 --> 19:02.912
valuable land.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.435
I've done my best
to delay the process, Corky,

19:05.440 --> 19:08.751
but at this point,
Donovan has the votes.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.752
The board meets tonight.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.673
That's why
he's so desperate.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.112
Sorry I couldn't
do more.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.112
I've exhausted my options.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.073
I haven't.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.680
You think you could stop
by the city clerk,

19:26.680 --> 19:28.797
see if you can
pick anything up?

19:28.800 --> 19:29.950
Of course.

19:33.760 --> 19:39.040
This woman is
a simple business owner.

19:39.760 --> 19:44.630
<i>We do not deny that she stabbed
Mister Ramsey in the eye...</i>

19:45.640 --> 19:50.396
But like most women
in her condition,

19:50.840 --> 19:55.039
she was reacting
purely from instinct...

19:56.040 --> 19:59.272
<i>Defending not only
her business,</i>

19:59.680 --> 20:01.751
<i>but her womb!</i>

20:01.760 --> 20:03.433
Her child!

20:20.440 --> 20:23.672
- Are you hurt?
- No, just an accident.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.080
Matthew.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.558
You can't keep going
on like this.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.960
Like what?

20:30.440 --> 20:32.079
Like this.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.995
You're boiling
from within.

20:47.160 --> 20:48.958
- I'm tired.
- You haven't slept.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.952
No, I'm tired!

20:50.960 --> 20:53.270
Of the world,
the people in it,

20:53.800 --> 20:56.793
their existence,
their ignorance.

20:57.560 --> 21:01.031
It courses through my bones
like an electrical charge.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.796
Which you can
no longer control.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.076
I don't think I have
the strength to tolerate,

21:06.080 --> 21:09.471
to excuse,
to turn the other cheek.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.675
<i>Then don't!</i>

21:10.680 --> 21:12.751
Your grievances are real,
Matthew.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.080
You were attacked!

21:14.080 --> 21:15.434
I've been beaten before.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.272
<i>When you were a slave,</i>

21:17.280 --> 21:18.270
when you couldn't
fight back.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.590
But now you have the freedom
to confront your attacker

21:20.600 --> 21:23.434
and leaving it unresolved
is gnawing at you.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.635
Confront him...

21:24.640 --> 21:28.316
Beat him or embrace
him, that's up to you,

21:28.960 --> 21:32.954
but don't allow this pain
to fester in your chest.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.390
I never had the opportunity
to face the men

21:38.400 --> 21:40.596
who killed my brothers.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.952
Don't let this one act
poison you

21:45.960 --> 21:49.078
towards the rest of life.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.833
<i>Call on Mister Flouton
personally</i>

22:02.840 --> 22:03.990
<i>to obtain the papers.</i>

22:04.000 --> 22:06.117
That lazy welshman
has a penchant

22:06.120 --> 22:07.315
for hiding in his office
all day,

22:07.320 --> 22:08.834
avoiding actual work.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.638
Yes, sir.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.150
Kevin.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.674
Donovan.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.751
It's been a long while
since you've come by for a chat.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.274
Everything all right?

22:17.280 --> 22:20.193
Well, busy days.
Been to see Eva?

22:20.200 --> 22:21.190
Busy days as well.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.839
Not that I'd be
of much assistance

22:22.840 --> 22:24.877
with her fate
in the jury's hands.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.310
Can I help you
with anything?

22:28.640 --> 22:30.677
Teresa Trembley's
still alive.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.560
Well...

22:32.560 --> 22:35.792
Not in body,
but her secrets.

22:36.440 --> 22:37.920
Poor girl.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.230
Strangled by a man

22:39.240 --> 22:42.039
who was clearly
on the edge of sanity.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.869
I assume you haven't found
a culprit yet, though?

22:47.880 --> 22:50.679
No...
but I'm gettin' close,

22:51.040 --> 22:52.520
and I will not rest
until I catch

22:52.520 --> 22:55.035
the sick bastard
that killed her.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.840
Kevin Corcoran...
ever tenacious

22:58.840 --> 23:01.594
even in the face
of overwhelming odds.

23:02.720 --> 23:06.316
I'll be sure to let
you know if I make any progress, sir.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.596
<i>See that you do, detective,
see that you do.</i>

23:08.600 --> 23:10.592
Hee-ya!

23:26.440 --> 23:27.635
May I help you with something, sir?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.233
Yes, I need to see
the property records

23:29.240 --> 23:31.675
listed for a Mister John Sutton.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.433
Which ones
were you interested in?

23:33.440 --> 23:34.635
All of them.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.075
Ten dollars for each
one you find.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.753
Yes, sir. Right away.

23:54.440 --> 23:57.194
While Robert has
disappointed me in numerous ways,

23:57.200 --> 24:00.113
I must claim my own failures.

24:00.120 --> 24:03.272
I cannot stand by
while another woman my son loves

24:03.280 --> 24:06.193
addles herself
to an early grave.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.193
I am stronger than you think.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.715
His mother once said
much the same.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.473
Continue down this path,
Elizabeth,

24:13.480 --> 24:15.631
and he will,
much like I did,

24:15.640 --> 24:17.279
simply harden
his heart.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.954
I'm sure you've felt
the distance growing.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.155
Robert seems to forget
that he's the one

24:21.160 --> 24:22.389
that put me on this path.

24:22.400 --> 24:25.120
I do not believe that
any man has ever forced you

24:25.120 --> 24:27.077
to do anything
you chose not to.

24:27.080 --> 24:30.312
Do not shirk your responsibility
in this situation, Elizabeth.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.880
Surely your father
taught you better than that.

24:32.880 --> 24:33.916
You have no idea

24:33.920 --> 24:36.151
what kind of a man
my father was!

24:39.560 --> 24:43.679
I know the coal mines
of Lancashire are a world away

24:43.680 --> 24:46.195
<i>from the parlors
of Manhattan.</i>

24:47.320 --> 24:49.630
I know the cunning needed

24:49.640 --> 24:53.395
to erase the tragedies
of one's past

24:53.400 --> 24:56.074
and forge a new life
from the ashes.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.959
How long have you known?

24:59.960 --> 25:03.112
Long enough.
But understand me, Elizabeth,

25:03.120 --> 25:05.680
I do not care why you choose
to cloud yourself

25:05.680 --> 25:06.875
with these substances,

25:06.880 --> 25:07.950
be it from the past,

25:07.960 --> 25:09.758
a disillusionment
with the present,

25:09.760 --> 25:11.991
or a general weakness
of character.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.832
I simply want it
to stop.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.991
Robert will be touched
by your concern.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.878
Robert will never know
we've spoken.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.200
You will either
clean yourself up

25:19.200 --> 25:20.680
or you will leave.

25:20.680 --> 25:21.670
Leave?

25:21.680 --> 25:25.515
A life can be arranged
for you in California.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.239
Reinvent yourself
yet again.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.880
I'm told that strong-willed,
opiate-loving women

25:29.880 --> 25:32.270
are in great demand
out there.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.600
Norbert.

25:39.880 --> 25:42.031
Thank you.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.197
Donovan.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.551
It would appear that
we have a fly in the ointment.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.518
Seem to be
having quite a few of those lately.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.710
And you seem to forget

25:59.720 --> 26:01.552
that you are paid
to facilitate my desires,

26:01.560 --> 26:02.789
not comment on them.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.359
Of course, General.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.360
Come here.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.634
Off with ye.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.833
Excuse me.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.593
Are the rest running late?

26:25.600 --> 26:27.557
We're scheduled to hold a vote
here this evening, are we not?

26:27.560 --> 26:29.199
<i>The meeting's been cancelled, sir.</i>

26:29.200 --> 26:32.637
What? Why the hell
was I not informed?!

26:32.640 --> 26:33.835
Where's Alderman Stonington?!

26:33.840 --> 26:35.320
That's the reason
it was cancelled.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.551
Mister Stonington was picked up
by police detectives

26:37.560 --> 26:39.552
an hour ago.

26:42.440 --> 26:47.071
<i>And you are certain
it was Donovan who sent you?</i>

26:47.080 --> 26:49.470
Yes, sir, Mister Stonington.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.039
Like I said,

26:51.040 --> 26:54.112
somethin' about a possible,
uh, threat on yer life.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.799
- Uh-huh.
<i>- It's probably nothin',</i>

26:56.800 --> 26:59.315
but, uh, after what happened
with Alderman Bartlett,

26:59.320 --> 27:01.880
General Donovan figured
it'd be best you stay here,

27:01.880 --> 27:03.439
<i>under our protection.</i>

27:03.440 --> 27:04.430
Of course.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.474
You got somewhere
I could spit?

27:14.800 --> 27:17.156
It seems Mister Sutton
"owns" quite a bit of property

27:17.160 --> 27:19.675
along the aqueduct route.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.270
Donovan and his friends
have been busy.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.792
Are you certain
you don't want me involved

27:24.800 --> 27:26.200
in the rest
of the operation?

27:26.360 --> 27:27.794
Well, thanks, Major,
but...

27:27.800 --> 27:30.156
It'll be better
if I handle this my way.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.310
Agh!

28:23.360 --> 28:26.876
Guess ya didn't hear...
Corky don't live here no more.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.754
Lucky for you,
no one else has moved in,

28:29.840 --> 28:32.560
so we'll have plenty of privacy
to talk.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.198
Spring water.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.760
Never had a taste
for the stuff myself.

29:09.200 --> 29:12.272
Perhaps getting married
so quickly was a mistake.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.679
I know trust broken

29:16.680 --> 29:19.957
can sometimes take time
to repair, but...

29:21.680 --> 29:25.560
I felt embraced one moment
and abandoned the next.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.317
That was never
my intention.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.510
Will there ever be a time

29:31.520 --> 29:33.159
when both of us
will simply be happy

29:33.160 --> 29:34.992
with one another?

29:36.760 --> 29:40.037
I don't know why I excuse
the same behaviors in myself

29:40.040 --> 29:42.111
that I scold you for.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.600
I...

29:45.400 --> 29:49.952
I am the last person
who should be casting stones.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.350
If we're to continue,
Robert,

29:53.360 --> 29:57.070
I need you,
unconditionally,

29:58.360 --> 30:01.432
no matter how we choose
to move forth,

30:01.880 --> 30:03.712
sober or otherwise.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.558
Aggghhhhhh!

30:19.600 --> 30:21.637
Just tell us
what we wanna hear.

30:21.640 --> 30:25.919
Ah, tare an'ouns.
He's a tough wee thing.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.958
The Bartlett murders,
Lansing, Teresa Trembley.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.316
Probably had you finish off
Jack Ramsey, too.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.913
And you know this how?

30:32.920 --> 30:35.037
'Cause this lying,
sack-of-shit cyclops

30:35.040 --> 30:36.269
told you so?

30:37.280 --> 30:39.158
Aggghhhhhhh!

30:39.160 --> 30:40.594
Just give us Donovan

30:40.600 --> 30:42.990
and I'll make sure
you're taken care of.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.913
You really are as stupid as he says.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.912
The man's untouchable.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.913
You are nothing,
an inconvenience to Donovan.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.593
You're shit on his shoe.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.920
Yet he sent you here
to clean me off,

30:53.920 --> 30:55.070
so what does that make you?

30:55.080 --> 30:57.754
Charge me with
whatever you want, assholes.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.679
It wont matter. I'll be back
on the street in an hour.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.716
Who said anything
about charging you?

31:03.720 --> 31:06.189
I was just askin'
a few questions.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.120
The important thing to remember
is that your own actions

31:15.120 --> 31:18.318
led to the predicament
that you're in.

31:21.640 --> 31:24.599
I'll kill you,
I swear to God!

31:24.600 --> 31:27.354
Oh, better men than you
have tried, boyo.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.876
No!
Aggghhhhhhh!

31:49.840 --> 31:52.230
Well, if it ain't
the most popular negro

31:52.240 --> 31:54.675
in New York City.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.434
Unless that...
that's not the right term?

31:58.000 --> 32:00.151
It's hard to keep up with
whatever it is you zip coons

32:00.160 --> 32:01.674
<i>want to be called these days.</i>

32:01.680 --> 32:04.514
I have no interest in you
calling me at all.

32:04.520 --> 32:06.398
Did you come here
to gloat?

32:08.360 --> 32:11.751
I came to settle this business
between us.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.752
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

32:14.760 --> 32:16.672
After you sent
your police friends around

32:16.680 --> 32:18.000
to fight for ya first.

32:18.000 --> 32:22.199
I don't recall you showing
up on my doorstep by yourself.

32:22.200 --> 32:24.431
Well, ya win, boy.

32:24.840 --> 32:26.194
Got no interest
in goin' up against

32:26.200 --> 32:28.715
the entire Metropolitan Police.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.119
Is that all?

32:39.360 --> 32:41.955
Or have you come
for your pound of flesh as well?

32:41.960 --> 32:44.555
I've given that thought
consideration.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.992
Well, I'm here,
ripe for the pickin'.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.312
What's stoppin' ya?

32:50.600 --> 32:53.160
Seems like that's
the only way men like you learn,

32:53.360 --> 32:54.760
through bloodshed.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.877
Don't act like yer above me.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.470
You may hide underneath
that fancy talk

33:00.480 --> 33:02.517
and those...
those dandy clothes,

33:02.520 --> 33:07.072
but I seen it...
that savage look in your eye.

33:07.080 --> 33:08.878
<i>You ain't nothin'
but an animal.</i>

33:08.880 --> 33:12.430
You're right,
I am an animal.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.872
As are you.
We all are.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.109
Speak for yourself.

33:17.120 --> 33:21.114
And like most animals
we are filled with base desires:

33:21.120 --> 33:23.555
hunger, lust, aggression,
violence,

33:23.560 --> 33:24.914
dominance.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.196
I've wrestled with
the primal nature inside of me,

33:27.200 --> 33:29.590
not wanting to validate
others' fears.

33:29.600 --> 33:31.751
I ain't afraid of you, boy.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.672
Oh, you are...

33:35.840 --> 33:37.752
...and you should be.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.952
Because I've suffered
the ignominy of men like you

33:40.960 --> 33:43.031
every day of my life,

33:43.040 --> 33:45.430
<i>and I have accepted
insult and injury</i>

33:45.440 --> 33:48.751
all with the hope that one day
I would be seen as equal.

33:50.280 --> 33:53.239
But I've realized
that I am not your equal.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.193
You're goddamn right
you're not.

33:56.200 --> 34:00.399
I'm smarter than you,
and I am stronger than you,

34:00.400 --> 34:02.073
and I am through
concerning myself

34:02.080 --> 34:05.676
with the growls of simpleminded,
mangy little dogs.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.158
Goldenseal salve.

34:12.600 --> 34:15.991
Put it on your wound
to prevent infection.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.391
Or don't...

34:20.400 --> 34:21.993
and let it rot.

34:22.400 --> 34:24.710
I honestly couldn't
give a shit.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.312
<i>Billy,
I need your help locating my--</i>

35:12.720 --> 35:16.157
I know you love
tellin' stories, so...

35:16.360 --> 35:18.397
Let me share one,

35:19.040 --> 35:24.035
about a wise man
with grand plans for his city.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.472
Plans that,
as things progressed,

35:26.480 --> 35:28.756
<i>he chose to see through
at any cost:</i>

35:28.760 --> 35:32.197
theft, deception, murder.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.190
Murder, you say?

35:33.200 --> 35:34.919
Oh yes.

35:34.920 --> 35:37.310
An Alderman and his son,

35:37.320 --> 35:39.391
a competitor,
an innocent girl.

35:39.400 --> 35:44.395
The wise man justified
his actions...

35:44.400 --> 35:47.632
...both to himself and others,
as part of the greater good.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.271
Perhaps he had a point.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.350
The wise man was a hypocrite.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.079
He didn't care about
his fellow citizens.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.480
He just...
well, hell,

35:55.480 --> 35:57.551
he'd rather throw them out
into the street,

35:57.560 --> 35:59.074
take their homes,

35:59.080 --> 36:02.198
all for the promise of a...
a little money.

36:02.200 --> 36:06.752
Oh, it was more than just
a little money, Kevin,

36:06.760 --> 36:09.559
but I shouldn't expect you
to understand.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.234
It's not in your nature.

36:12.280 --> 36:14.272
It's my own fault,
really,

36:14.680 --> 36:17.149
choosing to overestimate,

36:17.160 --> 36:19.629
see my young self in you.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.315
But you,
Kevin Corcoran,

36:23.320 --> 36:26.791
refuse to see the world
as it really is.

36:31.760 --> 36:32.955
Maybe.

36:34.120 --> 36:35.793
Maybe not.

36:38.040 --> 36:39.440
So what?

36:39.680 --> 36:42.320
Is this the part
where you throw me in shackles?

36:42.800 --> 36:44.029
In my world, yes.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.394
In your world,

36:45.880 --> 36:48.076
without any real evidence,
reliable witnesses...

36:48.080 --> 36:51.118
This?
It's all circumstantial.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.032
I'd never be able
to keep you in jail.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.793
How fortunate for me.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.555
Which means this
is usually the point

36:56.560 --> 36:58.597
where I put a bullet
in your brain

36:58.600 --> 36:59.590
and be done with it.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.956
That would be decidedly
unfortunate.

37:03.840 --> 37:08.119
But you're always goin' on
about how I should use my brain.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.191
Think less with my fists.

37:10.200 --> 37:13.432
So...
I'm here to cut a deal.

37:13.440 --> 37:17.116
You, compromising?
I'm shocked.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.197
More of a wager, actually.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.554
Open it.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.679
Five pulls
of the trigger.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.474
One bullet.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.632
One of us lives.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.997
One of us dies.

37:45.400 --> 37:48.996
That's not exactly what I meant
by using your head.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.356
I'm willing to put my life
on the line...

37:51.680 --> 37:53.114
...for Five Points.

37:53.360 --> 37:56.717
Then you're a fool,
for I am not.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.633
Pick one.
Go on.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.834
You see...

38:12.440 --> 38:15.353
There are people in this city
worth saving,

38:15.360 --> 38:16.396
good people,

38:16.400 --> 38:20.394
and I'm tired of men
like you using 'em,

38:20.600 --> 38:22.671
discarding them without
a second thought.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.758
You're insane.

38:37.360 --> 38:38.874
Probably.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.432
I've been at war,
in riots...

38:42.760 --> 38:44.433
I'm not afraid to die.

38:44.440 --> 38:46.591
Question is...

38:47.600 --> 38:49.000
Are you?

38:49.400 --> 38:52.074
For what reason would I agree
to such madness?

38:52.080 --> 38:54.197
<i>Because if you don't
I'll kill you right now.</i>

38:54.200 --> 38:56.157
The only way you're gonna
leave this room alive

38:56.160 --> 38:58.914
is by picking up
one of these guns.

39:00.520 --> 39:03.991
Do you honestly believe
that you'll get away with this?

39:05.080 --> 39:06.799
Well, I have before.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.632
Even if I don't,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.071
what more do I have
left to lose?

39:13.000 --> 39:14.070
Your turn.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.958
Oh, come on, Donovan!

39:16.960 --> 39:18.110
<i>I'm giving you
a sportin' chance.</i>

39:18.120 --> 39:19.634
Three outta four.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.313
Surely you can use
your vaunted intellect

39:22.320 --> 39:24.198
<i>to outsmart me,</i>

39:24.200 --> 39:26.192
<i>A lowly copper.</i>

39:50.480 --> 39:51.357
Mmm...

39:51.520 --> 39:53.079
That wasn't so bad,
was it?

39:53.080 --> 39:54.992
You speak of doing right
for your fellow man,

39:55.000 --> 39:56.480
but it's not justice
that drives you,

39:56.480 --> 39:57.960
Kevin Corcoran.

39:57.960 --> 39:58.950
- Is that so?
- No.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.191
Justice is convicting me
in court,

40:01.200 --> 40:02.190
not through some sick game.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.318
Justice is having faith
in the system! The Law!

40:05.320 --> 40:08.358
You and your friends
have broken the system.

40:08.360 --> 40:12.070
So now we're forced to follow
your own personal code then?

40:12.080 --> 40:13.753
<i>Is that it?</i>

40:13.960 --> 40:15.792
It's better than
what we've been given.

40:15.800 --> 40:17.120
Oh, really?

40:17.120 --> 40:20.796
Who says your code is better
than mine or anyone else's?

40:20.800 --> 40:21.790
What gives you the right?

40:21.800 --> 40:22.870
The gun in my hand.

40:22.880 --> 40:23.870
Ah-ha!

40:23.880 --> 40:26.395
And now we arrive
at your true motivation...

40:26.400 --> 40:28.710
...pain and death!

40:29.000 --> 40:31.310
<i>You cloak your unquenchable
instinct for violence</i>

40:31.320 --> 40:32.549
in the trappings of duty,

40:32.560 --> 40:35.314
oh, but, Kevin Corcoran,

40:35.680 --> 40:38.149
misery befalls anyone
in your orbit.

40:39.600 --> 40:42.274
<i>No wonder your wife sought
any avenue</i>

40:42.280 --> 40:44.237
to escape your touch.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.276
Where's that code of honor now?

41:12.080 --> 41:14.549
<i>Two left.</i>

41:14.560 --> 41:15.835
Almost over.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.869
But it's already over,
isn't it?

41:22.320 --> 41:25.518
Really, hmm?
You've rigged the game.

41:27.240 --> 41:29.197
What makes you say that?

41:29.200 --> 41:32.989
Whichever gun is loaded...
if one of them is loaded,

41:33.360 --> 41:34.999
<i>I lose.</i>

41:35.560 --> 41:37.153
I pick up the one
with the bullet,

41:37.160 --> 41:38.674
I shoot myself in the head.

41:38.680 --> 41:41.991
I pick up the empty gun,
and you're left with the one,

41:42.000 --> 41:43.116
<i>and honor or no,</i>

41:43.120 --> 41:46.113
I do not believe you will
willingly take your own life.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.190
No?

41:48.200 --> 41:50.840
Mmm,
you'll shoot me instead.

41:53.160 --> 41:56.073
That doesn't leave you
with many options, does it?

41:57.320 --> 41:58.595
Just one.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.553
Or...

42:01.640 --> 42:03.472
We call it a draw,

42:03.480 --> 42:06.040
on the condition that
you confess for your crimes

42:06.040 --> 42:07.554
and plead guilty.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.995
Perhaps you're more clever
than I gave you credit for,

42:12.000 --> 42:13.673
but the day I kowtow

42:13.680 --> 42:16.752
to a righteous little shit
like you

42:16.760 --> 42:17.989
will be my last.

42:49.720 --> 42:51.632
You're more like me
than you know,

42:51.640 --> 42:53.074
Kevin Corcoran.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.512
<i>Mo chara...</i>

42:58.600 --> 43:00.557
<i>...mo namhaid.</i>

43:01.305 --> 43:07.198
