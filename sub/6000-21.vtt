(Carter) Previously on "Finding Carter"...

00:01.913 --> 00:03.397
My dad is up for parole.

00:03.422 --> 00:05.924
I'm going to testify, make
sure that they keep him in.

00:05.949 --> 00:07.917
(dinging)

00:07.942 --> 00:09.857
My dad's getting out.

00:09.882 --> 00:11.454
- You were good.
- Thanks.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.446
E-mail me?

00:14.425 --> 00:17.051
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

00:18.605 --> 00:21.595
One of these days, I'm gonna
call on you for a favor,

00:21.620 --> 00:24.015
and when I do, you're
gonna deliver, got it?

00:24.040 --> 00:26.592
- I'm taking Liv to rehab.
- How long do you think you're gonna be home?

00:26.617 --> 00:28.949
I've been thinking maybe I need
to get out of dodge myself.

00:28.974 --> 00:31.142
I just need some space.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.209
So I cleaned out a drawer for you.

00:33.234 --> 00:36.281
And tomorrow, I'm gonna
get you some closet space.

your sense of adventure.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.765
I've had plenty of adventure
in my life, thank you,

Okay.

01:12.191 --> 01:13.760
Judy.

01:15.733 --> 01:18.410
Whew, God, glad to finally be out of there.

01:18.435 --> 01:19.842
Oh, she's claustrophobic.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.682
You know, you really should tell the super

01:21.707 --> 01:22.973
that the elevator is acting up again.

01:22.998 --> 01:24.666
It's like, really unacceptable.

01:24.691 --> 01:26.958
- Yeah, I will.
- I will definitely do that. Yeah, it's really...

01:31.060 --> 01:32.980
- Do you think she bought it?
- No.

01:33.005 --> 01:35.522
That's Judy, she's kind
of like the floor Nazi.

01:35.547 --> 01:37.422
I would stay clear of her if I were you.

01:37.447 --> 01:38.613
Duly noted.

01:40.740 --> 01:43.575
Did we forget to shut
the door when we left?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.281
No, I shut it.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.486

02:27.489 --> 02:28.734
They went through everything.

02:28.759 --> 02:31.349
They took my computer,
my watches, my guitars,

02:31.374 --> 02:33.418
and all the money I made from our parties.

02:33.443 --> 02:35.003
I thought you said this
was a safe neighborhood.

02:35.028 --> 02:36.433
It is.

02:36.459 --> 02:38.825
Do you think maybe Sarah had
something to do with this?

02:38.850 --> 02:40.217
Yeah, who knows?

02:40.242 --> 02:41.953
I mean, I wouldn't put it past her.

02:41.978 --> 02:45.129
Well, for Christ's sake,
Jared, then you need to change

02:45.154 --> 02:47.544
the locks, get a security system installed.

02:47.569 --> 02:50.234
- Done.
- No, like a really good security system,

02:50.259 --> 02:52.616
one that alerts the cops
when there's a break-in.

02:52.641 --> 02:55.228
- Speaking of which.
- No. Hey, no cops.

02:55.253 --> 02:57.021
Jared, it was a break-in,
I have to call the cops.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.109
What am I gonna say? That
the four grand in cash

02:59.134 --> 03:01.268
I made from illegal parties was stolen?

03:01.293 --> 03:03.294
I mean, it's not like they're
ever gonna find it anyway.

03:03.319 --> 03:05.075
That money's gone.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.687
Okay, well, look.

03:09.712 --> 03:11.522
We'll just throw more parties, okay?

03:11.547 --> 03:13.047
We can make all of the money back.

03:13.072 --> 03:15.374
Yeah, how many more can we
realistically throw anyway?

03:15.399 --> 03:17.181
The last one almost got shut down.

03:17.206 --> 03:18.859
Yeah, and we talked our way out of it.

03:18.884 --> 03:20.951
Maybe next time we won't be so lucky.

03:22.507 --> 03:24.709
Okay, well, uh...

03:25.380 --> 03:27.408
What if the parties weren't illegal?

03:27.433 --> 03:28.611
- (scoffs)
- No, seriously.

03:28.636 --> 03:30.420
What if we went, like, fully legit?

03:30.445 --> 03:31.402
Yeah, how would that work?

03:31.427 --> 03:32.537
We could rent a space

03:32.562 --> 03:34.392
instead of sneaking into an illegal one.

03:34.417 --> 03:35.839
We could open up a business account,

03:35.864 --> 03:37.362
put all of our profits
in the bank rather than

03:37.387 --> 03:39.522
under some mattress for anyone to find.

03:39.547 --> 03:41.906
Well, first security guards and now this?

03:41.931 --> 03:44.132
I mean, how are we gonna turn a profit?

03:44.157 --> 03:46.352
Jared, we could triple the
amount of parties we throw

03:46.377 --> 03:49.131
and therefore, the amount of money we make.

03:49.156 --> 03:51.124
Look, I get that it would be a risk,

03:51.149 --> 03:53.383
but if this works,

03:53.408 --> 03:56.667
this could be the start of a
legitimate business for us.

03:57.221 --> 04:00.119
Come on, where's your sense of adventure?

04:07.278 --> 04:09.574
This is part one of a trilogy?

04:09.599 --> 04:11.934
I'm sorry I hijacked our movie night,

04:11.959 --> 04:13.626
but I need this extra
credit if I'm gonna beat

04:13.651 --> 04:15.346
Damon's GPA in French class.

04:15.371 --> 04:18.851
This... has a tenth of a point on me.

04:19.923 --> 04:23.235
I'm driving up to York
tomorrow to see my mom.

04:23.260 --> 04:25.550
She wants me to come for a visit.

04:25.764 --> 04:28.248
Well, how is she handling
your dad being out?

04:28.273 --> 04:30.674
She says she's fine,

04:30.829 --> 04:32.429
but I think it's been hard on her.

04:32.454 --> 04:34.321
Do you want me to come with you?

04:34.346 --> 04:36.280
Keep you company?

04:36.408 --> 04:39.893
That'd be great. It's a long drive.

04:41.023 --> 04:42.861
Would you ever want her to...

04:42.898 --> 04:46.552
- move closer, just so you guys aren't so far away?
- I'd love that.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.044
I don't think she would ever do it.

04:48.069 --> 04:50.203
Well, I'm sure that you could convince her.

04:50.228 --> 04:51.441
You think?

04:51.466 --> 04:53.793
Yeah, you can be very
persuasive when you want to.

04:53.818 --> 04:57.184
Persuasive enough to get you
to bail on this extra credit?

04:57.209 --> 04:58.577
No, not that persuasive.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.419
Will you at least admit
that you have no idea

05:02.444 --> 05:04.534
what's going on in this movie.

05:06.129 --> 05:08.747
- (speaking French)
- No!

05:08.772 --> 05:10.708
I know exactly what's going on.

05:10.733 --> 05:12.455
So you're saying that
you actually missed me

05:12.480 --> 05:13.672
these last couple weeks.

05:13.697 --> 05:16.389
I said I missed having you
around; there's a difference.

05:16.414 --> 05:18.130
Oh, okay, that sounds exactly the same.

05:18.162 --> 05:20.572
Well, you might want to get
your ears checked, then.

05:20.597 --> 05:22.744
Seriously, how's Olivia doing?

05:22.769 --> 05:25.613
Uh, pretty good, from what
her counselors have told me.

05:25.638 --> 05:27.214
- That's really good.
- Yeah.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.911
The problem is, what
happens when she gets out?

05:29.936 --> 05:32.171
Is she gonna go into another Foster family?

05:32.196 --> 05:33.797
Yeah, or a group home.

05:33.822 --> 05:36.057
And they're not actually
that bad, it's just...

05:36.082 --> 05:38.635
It's not the healthiest
environment coming out of rehab.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.261
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know, I thought about maybe

05:40.286 --> 05:42.655
getting her an apartment,
keeping her close by.

05:42.680 --> 05:43.922
You know, keeping tabs on her,

05:43.947 --> 05:45.192
making sure she doesn't backslide.

05:45.225 --> 05:47.199
Would they even let her
out of the system so young?

05:47.223 --> 05:48.978
Won't that be really expensive?

05:49.003 --> 05:50.191
Yes, it would be.

05:50.216 --> 05:51.561
What about Lori?

05:51.586 --> 05:52.383
What about her?

05:52.408 --> 05:54.216
Well, wouldn't she take Olivia in?

05:54.241 --> 05:57.109
No, I doubt that she would have
any interest in taking some

05:57.134 --> 05:59.855
teenager that she barely even
knows, let alone an addict.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.494
All right, firstly you're forgetting,

06:01.519 --> 06:03.420
that Lori would do just
about anything right now

06:03.445 --> 06:05.719
to keep you happy and keep you in town.

06:05.744 --> 06:08.814
Secondly, she actually
likes helping people.

06:08.839 --> 06:11.807
It's one of her more positive attributes.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.917
I don't know.

06:14.942 --> 06:18.192
I mean, that's like a big
thing to ask somebody.

06:19.774 --> 06:21.787
You really think she'd say yes?

06:21.812 --> 06:24.433
Yeah, I really think she might.

06:34.383 --> 06:35.837
Can I help you with something?

06:35.862 --> 06:38.021
Yeah. Vacation's over.

06:38.046 --> 06:39.746
Time to get back to work.

06:39.771 --> 06:41.673
Look, I told you before I left
town, I'm done selling to you.

06:41.698 --> 06:42.798
Whoa.

06:42.823 --> 06:44.725
What makes you think you have a choice?

06:44.750 --> 06:46.223
You owe me.

06:46.247 --> 06:48.804
Now, you told me a couple
of parties and I did that.

06:48.829 --> 06:50.663
As far as I'm concerned, my debt's paid.

06:50.726 --> 06:53.148
Well, then I guess I'm just
gonna have to call the cops

06:53.173 --> 06:54.718
and tell them about that
little credit card scam

06:54.743 --> 06:56.842
you tried to run on me and I'm pretty sure

06:56.867 --> 06:58.981
that you have going elsewhere.

06:59.006 --> 07:00.940
You know what, man? Do it.

07:01.038 --> 07:02.338
I don't care.

07:02.363 --> 07:04.483
I wasn't cool selling before
you forced me to do it

07:04.508 --> 07:06.950
and after watching my
sister these last few weeks?

07:06.975 --> 07:09.808
I'm even less cool with
it. In fact, use my phone.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.000
Here.

07:11.025 --> 07:13.581
Knock yourself out, call the cops.

07:15.896 --> 07:18.331
All right look, we got
a party tomorrow night.

07:18.356 --> 07:21.486
Whatever you make, I'll cut you in, 20%.

07:24.020 --> 07:25.538
Wow.

07:25.563 --> 07:28.199
You must be in a bad
way to float that offer.

07:28.326 --> 07:29.994
You in or out?

07:30.019 --> 07:31.982
I'm out.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.512
How much money am I holding?

07:40.537 --> 07:43.538
I don't know, like 4,000
maybe. How do you not know?

07:43.563 --> 07:45.141
Are you not keeping track?

07:45.166 --> 07:47.163
No, I haven't been, that's
why I'm giving it to a bank,

07:47.188 --> 07:48.555
so they can keep track for me.

07:48.580 --> 07:50.272
You really seem like
you've found your calling

07:50.297 --> 07:51.731
with these parties.

07:51.756 --> 07:53.108
Well, I don't know about that.

07:53.133 --> 07:55.568
It does feel good to actually
be good at something for once,

07:55.593 --> 07:58.063
so I like that part way
more than the money.

07:58.088 --> 07:59.385
Well, I'm sorry I'll miss your first night

07:59.410 --> 08:01.186
as a legitimate businesswoman.

08:01.211 --> 08:03.071
I told Max I would go see his mom with him.

08:03.096 --> 08:05.377
Oh, no, come on, you should
go. That's way more important.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.155
But we're still gonna stop
by Gabe's before we leave.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.749
Wouldn't want to miss
Bird's big announcement.

08:10.774 --> 08:12.019
Yeah.

08:12.044 --> 08:13.644
Do you have any idea what it could be?

08:13.669 --> 08:15.019
Eh, it's Bird.

08:15.044 --> 08:18.924
Who knows what's up her
custom-tailored sleeve?

08:21.351 --> 08:24.303
- You having a stroke?
- No, I'm making it rain.

08:24.328 --> 08:26.406
You know, like in the rap videos.

08:26.431 --> 08:27.298
Is it working?

08:27.323 --> 08:29.933
It looks more like a light drizzle

08:35.105 --> 08:38.357
You could knock. Well, when you're not
home for four days, knocking before

08:38.381 --> 08:40.714
entering privileges are typically revoked.

08:40.739 --> 08:42.947
I'm gonna...

08:45.381 --> 08:47.449
To what do we owe your presence?

08:47.474 --> 08:49.464
I just came by to get
some more of my stuff.

08:49.489 --> 08:52.662
- To bring back to Lori's.
- Jared's, actually.

08:52.789 --> 08:55.878
You're crashing at Jared's now?

08:55.903 --> 08:57.938
Well, I'd say it was a
little more than crashing,

08:57.963 --> 08:59.278
but yeah, I am.

08:59.303 --> 09:00.403
What is that supposed to mean?

09:00.428 --> 09:02.397
It means we're living together.

09:02.422 --> 09:04.355
This is a permanent move.

09:04.380 --> 09:06.798
You know, Carter, I've
made an effort to take

09:06.823 --> 09:08.690
a hands-off approach with you,

09:08.715 --> 09:12.213
give you space, let you do
whatever it is you're doing.

09:12.238 --> 09:14.418
Yes, and I appreciate that, thank you.

09:14.443 --> 09:15.910
But you don't even know this man.

09:15.935 --> 09:17.118
Mom, do you really think

09:17.143 --> 09:19.056
I would be moving in with
him if I didn't know him?

09:19.081 --> 09:21.843
Yes, actually, I think that you
would do pretty much anything

09:21.868 --> 09:23.761
to get away from me these days.

09:23.786 --> 09:25.319
This isn't about you, Mom.

09:25.344 --> 09:28.080
This is about me and Jared
and how I feel about him.

09:28.105 --> 09:30.243
He is a good guy. He really cares about me.

09:30.268 --> 09:32.536
You have nothing to worry
about. Would you please stop?

09:32.561 --> 09:34.928
I have everything to worry about, Carter.

09:34.953 --> 09:36.119
This is a huge deal.

09:36.144 --> 09:39.237
You are too young to be doing any of this.

09:39.262 --> 09:40.868
So Jared is the guy that
you're throwing these

09:40.893 --> 09:43.523
underground parties with?

09:44.853 --> 09:47.268
- Where did you hear that?
- Officer Lopez.

09:47.293 --> 09:48.902
Old cop friend of mine.

09:48.927 --> 09:50.519
He said that you two met.

09:50.544 --> 09:52.935
Yeah, we did. Nice guy.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.061
Didn't arrest anybody
or shut the place down,

09:55.086 --> 09:57.638
so I'm not really sure why
he felt the need to call you.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.763
So it's true about these
underground parties?

09:59.788 --> 10:02.790
Is this line of questioning part
of your new hands-off approach?

10:02.815 --> 10:05.946
I have a cop calling me saying
that you might be involved

10:05.971 --> 10:07.248
in illegal activity,

10:07.273 --> 10:09.809
you're stuffing handfuls
of cash in your bag

10:09.834 --> 10:11.421
and now you're telling
me that you're living

10:11.446 --> 10:13.046
with your 25-year-old boyfriend.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.776
Consider my hands officially back on.

10:15.801 --> 10:18.536
Do you think for once
you could just trust me?

10:18.561 --> 10:20.224
- Trust you?
- Yeah. Trust me.

10:20.249 --> 10:22.248
Trust is something that you earn,

10:22.273 --> 10:25.657
and the way that you've been
behaving lately, lying to me,

10:25.682 --> 10:28.009
I don't know if I'll ever
be able to trust you again.

10:28.034 --> 10:29.357
Okay, well, then you know what?

10:29.382 --> 10:32.766
- Maybe this came at just the right point.
- Just, stop.

10:32.791 --> 10:34.544
You can't move out.

10:34.569 --> 10:37.703
I understand you needed a few
days, you needed your space,

10:37.728 --> 10:40.609
but you live here, Carter.

10:40.634 --> 10:43.077
This is your home.

10:44.114 --> 10:46.058
Not anymore.

10:56.376 --> 10:58.666
The church was decommissioned back in 1987,

10:58.691 --> 11:00.145
our leasing company snatched it up

11:00.170 --> 11:02.145
and it's been available
for rent ever since.

11:02.170 --> 11:03.847
Great stage for a DJ.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.409
Lots of space for dancing.

11:05.434 --> 11:07.612
- How much?
- 1, 800.

11:07.637 --> 11:09.799
Carter, can I talk to you in private?

11:09.824 --> 11:11.820
Uh, yeah, just give us a sec.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.101
$1,800?

11:16.126 --> 11:17.260
Okay, I know it's a little steep,

11:17.285 --> 11:19.052
but look how cool this place is.

11:19.077 --> 11:21.999
- Yeah, that won't matter if nobody shows up.
- Why would nobody show up?

11:22.024 --> 11:23.466
Because the parties won't
be underground anymore,

11:23.491 --> 11:24.967
which makes them awesome.

11:24.992 --> 11:27.733
Nobody wants to go to a
party thrown by the man.

11:27.758 --> 11:29.796
Okay, firstly, the parties
aren't being thrown by

11:29.821 --> 11:32.716
"the man," they're being thrown by a woman.

11:33.018 --> 11:35.331
- Secondly... 
- (cell phone vibrating)

11:35.553 --> 11:37.955
_

11:37.980 --> 11:40.627
Secondly, parties being underground is not

11:40.652 --> 11:41.862
what makes the parties awesome,

11:41.887 --> 11:42.803
the parties being awesome

11:42.828 --> 11:44.520
is what makes the parties awesome.

11:44.545 --> 11:45.715
I'm telling you, you want
to make your money back?

11:45.740 --> 11:47.371
This is how we're gonna do it.

11:49.851 --> 11:51.952
- We'll take it.
- Fantastic.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.645
Now, you have to be 21 years
or over to rent this property.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.438
I assume that won't be a problem.

11:56.463 --> 11:58.130
Uh, no, it's no problem.

11:58.155 --> 12:00.451
Here you go.

12:00.841 --> 12:03.519
Okay. Thank you.

12:06.052 --> 12:10.207
I understand, but I have over
ten years of hospice experience.

12:11.205 --> 12:15.048
No, the press hasn't said the
most flattering things about me,

12:15.073 --> 12:17.247
but one mistake from my past should...

12:17.273 --> 12:20.297
If you'll just give me a chance, I can...

12:23.070 --> 12:25.155
Thank you for your time.

12:26.114 --> 12:27.744
Hey.

12:28.985 --> 12:30.587
Hey, how's it going?

12:30.612 --> 12:31.779
Fine.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.636
Can I help you with something?

12:34.661 --> 12:37.613
Uh...  Yeah.

12:37.638 --> 12:39.038
Um...

12:39.131 --> 12:42.266
Carter said I missed your
birthday when I was gone.

12:42.291 --> 12:44.038
Yeah, we had a fun time.

12:44.063 --> 12:46.174
Yeah, we should go out together sometime,

12:46.199 --> 12:48.403
the three of us, you know, hang out.

12:48.428 --> 12:50.062
I could get you a drink for
your birthday, you know,

12:50.087 --> 12:52.355
non-alcoholic, of course.

12:52.380 --> 12:53.717
Yeah, sure.

12:53.742 --> 12:55.476
Okay, cool.

12:55.501 --> 12:56.867
Cool.

13:00.193 --> 13:02.100
Look, I don't mean to
put you on blast here,

13:02.125 --> 13:04.525
but you're being such a
girl about all of this.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.731
Uh, excuse me. What is
that supposed to mean?

13:06.756 --> 13:08.228
The way you've been with Mom lately.

13:08.253 --> 13:09.840
<i>You know, so melodramatic.</i>

13:09.865 --> 13:12.132
"No one trusts me! I'm moving out!

13:12.157 --> 13:14.136
We mustn't speak."

13:14.161 --> 13:16.235
Grant, that is not how I sound.

13:16.260 --> 13:18.128
<i>I'm just saying, with Dad gone</i>

13:18.153 --> 13:20.349
<i>and Taylor always away at Max's,</i>

13:20.374 --> 13:22.905
it's lonely around here.

13:22.930 --> 13:25.497
This house feels empty without you in it.

13:26.678 --> 13:30.022
Look, I miss you too, Grant. <i>And Taylor.</i>

13:30.047 --> 13:32.944
You know, I never planned
on things being this way.

13:32.969 --> 13:35.120
Yeah.

13:35.145 --> 13:38.256
<i>Well, if you're not coming
home, can I turn your room</i>

13:38.281 --> 13:40.538
into my personal gaming suite?

13:41.514 --> 13:43.171
<i>I would personally be fine with that,</i>

13:43.196 --> 13:44.763
but I think you're gonna have

13:44.788 --> 13:47.098
to hash that one out with Taylor.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.677
Grant, I'm gonna have to call you back.

14:00.142 --> 14:02.914
- I got it right after the break-in - Why?

14:02.939 --> 14:04.538
Because you were really freaked out

14:04.563 --> 14:07.064
And I want to do everything
I can to make you feel safe.

14:07.089 --> 14:09.783
Well, I don't feel safe with
a gun in the house, Jared.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.675
Do you know how much safer
you are statistically,

14:11.700 --> 14:13.026
<i>not</i> having a gun around?

14:13.051 --> 14:14.118
That may be true, but there are a lot

14:14.143 --> 14:16.177
of people out there with them.

14:16.202 --> 14:19.290
- And I got it legally.
- That is not the point.

14:21.083 --> 14:23.050
Look, it just makes me
really uncomfortable.

14:23.075 --> 14:24.876
Could you please get rid of it?

14:24.901 --> 14:27.413
Say no more. It's gone.

14:27.438 --> 14:29.614
Thank you.

14:29.722 --> 14:30.856
You gotta love a girl who throws

14:30.881 --> 14:33.339
a celebratory party for herself.

14:33.364 --> 14:34.868
It's not even her birthday.

14:34.893 --> 14:37.161
Are there any guesses what
the big announcement is?

14:37.186 --> 14:39.954
I'll bet 50 bucks that she
and Seth are getting married.

14:39.979 --> 14:42.047
- No way.
- That's insane.

14:42.072 --> 14:44.318
Yeah, well, so is Bird.
I mean, in a good way.

14:44.343 --> 14:45.744
No, I'll take that action.

14:45.769 --> 14:47.002
50 bucks.

14:47.027 --> 14:49.194
- All right, you're on.
- (glasses clinking)

14:49.219 --> 14:51.258
Can I have your attention, please?

14:51.283 --> 14:54.752
I just wanted to, um,
thank you guys for coming.

14:54.777 --> 14:56.162
I wanted all my best friends here

14:56.187 --> 14:58.719
so I could share the good news.

14:58.744 --> 15:01.030
As Jackson Pollock once said...

15:01.055 --> 15:02.159
You're killing us, come on.

15:02.184 --> 15:03.513
Just spill it already.

15:03.538 --> 15:05.105
Okay, fine.

15:05.130 --> 15:08.132
Seth got a residency as a DJ in New York

15:08.199 --> 15:10.267
and we're gonna move there for the summer!

15:10.326 --> 15:12.690
- Woo, that's amazing.
- (Gabe) And congrats.

15:12.724 --> 15:14.817
(Seth) But that's only half the news.

15:14.842 --> 15:18.504
Bird got an internship at a
fancy art gallery in Chelsea.

15:18.529 --> 15:21.240
- Chelsea!
- Love it.

15:21.265 --> 15:23.706
And now we're both gonna
be living our dreams.

15:23.731 --> 15:25.503
Together.

15:25.528 --> 15:27.166
Okay, we're still here.

15:27.628 --> 15:30.463
So, pre-party on and we'll head over

15:30.488 --> 15:32.022
to Carter's popup in a few hours.

15:32.082 --> 15:34.417
(Bird) Well, how about some
tunes, Mr. Celebrity DJ?

15:34.442 --> 15:36.142
You got it, babe.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.363
I love that they can just
pick up and move to New York

15:38.388 --> 15:39.923
on a whim like that.

15:39.948 --> 15:42.685
No responsibilities,
nothing holding 'em back.

15:42.710 --> 15:44.911
I wish I could say the same for us.

15:45.035 --> 15:46.268
What are you talking about?

15:46.293 --> 15:48.896
Sarah not signing the divorce papers.

15:48.921 --> 15:51.156
I just hate that it's
hanging over our heads.

15:51.181 --> 15:54.404
I know. Not an ideal situation, but...

15:54.430 --> 15:56.373
I'm okay with it.

15:56.398 --> 15:58.857
- Honestly.
- But I'm not.

15:58.892 --> 16:01.953
I'm gonna hire the best
lawyer I can and get her

16:01.978 --> 16:03.684
out of my life once and for all.

16:03.709 --> 16:06.541
I don't care how much it costs.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.800
We're living together now.

16:08.825 --> 16:11.506
We deserve a clean slate.

Mom?

16:33.817 --> 16:35.579
Aww.

16:35.604 --> 16:37.371
Do you want to wear this for me tonight?

16:37.533 --> 16:38.723
Don't start.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.076
Max!

16:40.101 --> 16:42.075
Aww...

16:45.111 --> 16:48.614
- It is so good to see you.
- You too.

16:48.646 --> 16:51.496
- Remember Taylor?
- Of course.

16:51.660 --> 16:53.709
Oh. Well, hugs work, too.

16:53.734 --> 16:55.901
I didn't know you were
coming, what a nice surprise.

16:55.926 --> 16:57.574
Oh.

16:59.206 --> 17:01.574
So?

17:01.599 --> 17:03.167
How are you doing with everything?

17:03.192 --> 17:05.829
Oh, fine. I'm fine.

17:05.854 --> 17:10.525
You're not worried he's gonna
come by, try to contact you.

17:10.647 --> 17:13.869
Funny you should mention that.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.438
Hey, son.

17:23.878 --> 17:25.970
(Rock music)

17:25.994 --> 17:28.876
<i>Well, aren't we just a
picture of family bliss?</i>

17:28.901 --> 17:31.671
Mom hanging out with her
two underage kids, in a bar.

17:31.696 --> 17:33.145
One who works here illegally.

17:33.170 --> 17:34.784
Well, to each his own.

17:35.562 --> 17:37.771
Well, I'm sorry I'm pulling you
guys away from your friends.

17:37.796 --> 17:39.097
No, it's totally fine.

17:39.122 --> 17:40.419
We're just gonna catch up with them later.

17:40.444 --> 17:41.644
(cell phone vibrating)

17:42.758 --> 17:44.892
_

17:45.265 --> 17:48.799
So, what's going on with you?
How's the job search going?

17:48.824 --> 17:51.433
Um... really well.

17:51.458 --> 17:54.699
I actually spoke to someone today

17:54.724 --> 17:57.824
and I think they're gonna make me an offer.

17:57.848 --> 17:59.504
- Oh, that's so cool.
- Yeah.

17:59.529 --> 18:01.430
Yeah, it is... In fact,

18:01.454 --> 18:03.806
the next round is on me. Be right back.

18:03.831 --> 18:05.599
Thanks.

18:08.199 --> 18:09.665
- What?
- No, nothing.

18:09.690 --> 18:10.912
What? Just say it.

18:10.937 --> 18:12.469
I thought you invited me
here 'cause you were gonna

18:12.494 --> 18:14.095
ask Lori about Olivia.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.387
Well, maybe I just wanted to spend

18:15.412 --> 18:17.996
some quality time with my family.

18:19.795 --> 18:21.225
All right, look, I'm not good

18:21.250 --> 18:23.082
with asking people for help, all right?

18:23.107 --> 18:24.841
It's just not my thing, like, ever.

18:24.866 --> 18:26.367
I just figured it would be
easier to have you as backup.

18:26.392 --> 18:27.663
- That's it.
- Okay, well, look,

18:27.688 --> 18:28.871
do you want me to just ask her for you?

18:28.896 --> 18:30.608
No. No, I've got this I...

18:30.633 --> 18:32.033
I just need to find the right moment.

18:32.058 --> 18:33.626
Drinks are by the pool table.

18:33.651 --> 18:34.738
Who's up for a game?

18:34.763 --> 18:36.234
- Sure.
- Yeah.

18:36.259 --> 18:37.473
You're in for a world of hurt, though.

18:37.498 --> 18:39.235
Bring it, sonny.

18:41.201 --> 18:43.669
Please tell me that you two
are not getting back together.

18:43.694 --> 18:44.846
No, of course not.

18:44.871 --> 18:46.204
Okay, then what the hell is he doing here?

18:46.229 --> 18:47.940
He wanted to see you.

18:47.965 --> 18:51.735
- Why?
- To show you he's not the same guy anymore.

18:51.853 --> 18:54.087
That's why you had me come up here?

18:54.112 --> 18:56.299
I understand how you feel,
but he stayed out of trouble

18:56.324 --> 18:58.021
the whole time he was in prison.

18:58.046 --> 18:59.381
He got clean.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.708
I have seen a change in
him and I think if you just

I made it up.

20:40.801 --> 20:42.347
What? Why?

20:42.372 --> 20:44.124
Because it's humiliating
telling your daughter

world finds you unemployable.

20:47.702 --> 20:50.607

I screwed up my life so badly,

20:50.632 --> 20:53.901

20:53.926 --> 20:54.992
Okay, well, look.

helped out with Olivia?

20:58.752 --> 21:00.205
I can't ask you to do that.

21:00.230 --> 21:01.892
No, you're not asking, I'm offering.

When you came into my home

it was the right thing to do,

29:54.002 --> 29:56.060
You said some pretty rough stuff about me.

29:56.085 --> 29:57.568
I wasn't sure if you were
gonna stay for dinner,

29:57.593 --> 29:58.859
but I'm glad you did.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.252
I didn't stay for you.

30:00.277 --> 30:02.074
I know.

30:02.099 --> 30:05.218
But I'll take time with my
son any way I can get it.

30:05.243 --> 30:09.055
Look, if you never want to
see me again after tonight,

30:09.080 --> 30:10.948
I'll leave you alone.

30:11.016 --> 30:12.350
You have my word.

30:12.417 --> 30:16.168
Your word doesn't hold a
whole lot of water with me.

30:17.083 --> 30:19.765
- Found it!
- (strumming)

30:19.790 --> 30:22.225
Why did you keep that thing
around all these years?

30:22.250 --> 30:23.702
Well, you know, I was...

30:23.727 --> 30:25.094
You don't throw something away just 'cause

30:25.119 --> 30:28.077
it's a little old and busted up.

30:30.634 --> 30:32.168
Okay, look at the view from this roof.

30:32.193 --> 30:34.029
You can see over the whole city.

30:34.054 --> 30:35.788
Where am I gonna sleep
when I come to visit?

30:35.813 --> 30:38.281
Don't you worry, I got you.

30:38.306 --> 30:40.413
Guest bedroom, bam.

30:40.438 --> 30:42.989
Oh, that'll work, that's nice.

30:43.014 --> 30:45.557
- Can I get a refill?
- That's your third.

30:45.582 --> 30:48.737
I'm good for it. You're
not good for anything.

30:49.059 --> 30:51.595
I'm kidding!

30:55.714 --> 30:57.981
♪ Don't ♪

30:58.731 --> 31:01.567

Sometimes, I would refuse

31:26.801 --> 31:29.795
Oh.

31:31.768 --> 31:33.935
I thought you said you were done drinking.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.826
I am.

31:36.054 --> 31:37.378
I was sipping.

31:37.403 --> 31:39.674
There's a big difference.

31:46.470 --> 31:49.725
Okay. We're done.

31:50.460 --> 31:52.415
- Excuse me?
- You need to go.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.370
You can't be in this
house with her anymore.

31:54.916 --> 31:57.857
I don't think that's really up to you, son.

31:57.882 --> 32:00.626
Stop calling me son!

32:01.253 --> 32:02.620
All right, you need to calm down.

32:02.645 --> 32:03.812
You know what I think?

32:03.837 --> 32:05.432
I think that that parole board let you out

32:05.457 --> 32:07.482
because of overcrowding,
not because you're reformed.

32:07.507 --> 32:08.668
They just needed the space.

32:08.693 --> 32:10.060
Max, it's...  It's okay, don't.

32:10.085 --> 32:11.185
Listen to your mother.
I gotta hand it to you.

32:11.210 --> 32:13.606
You almost had me fooled, too.

32:13.631 --> 32:15.265
Just like you did when I was a kid.

32:15.290 --> 32:17.843
Every time you got clean
off of a bender and triee

32:17.868 --> 32:20.703
to convince me that everything
was gonna be different,

32:20.728 --> 32:21.828
but it wasn't then.

32:21.853 --> 32:23.621
And it isn't now, because you're still

32:23.646 --> 32:27.060
the same old goddamn loser!

32:31.775 --> 32:34.059
No! No, no, no!

32:34.084 --> 32:37.132
(grunting)

32:53.904 --> 32:56.134
Hey. You seen Jared?

32:56.159 --> 32:57.926
Yeah, I just saw him head to the back.

32:57.951 --> 32:59.519
Thanks.

33:04.459 --> 33:06.627
Okay, I'm gonna ask you a question

33:06.652 --> 33:09.358
and I want you to be 100% honest.

33:09.383 --> 33:12.253
Wouldn't dream of giving
you a lesser percentage.

33:12.278 --> 33:13.583
What's the question?

33:13.608 --> 33:17.378
I know Bird is going to New
York with Seth for the summer

33:17.403 --> 33:19.323
and they're in love

33:19.348 --> 33:22.536
and they're soul mates
and all that, but...

33:23.999 --> 33:26.734
Do you think I still have a shot with her?

33:26.759 --> 33:28.427
Make that a double, will yoo?

33:28.452 --> 33:30.178
You really didn't have
to show up here, Rick.

33:30.203 --> 33:31.503
I got everything under control.

33:31.528 --> 33:33.014
Now, would you call being
late on your last payment

33:33.039 --> 33:34.272
having things under control?

33:34.297 --> 33:35.993
Hey, it was three days, okay?

33:36.018 --> 33:37.866
You didn't have to break into my apartment.

33:37.891 --> 33:40.192
You think I enjoy spending my
Friday nights rifling through

33:40.217 --> 33:42.752
your underwear drawer looking
for the money that you owe me?

33:42.777 --> 33:43.609
I don't.

33:43.634 --> 33:45.383
But I received exactly eight grand.

33:45.408 --> 33:46.743
What was I supposed to do?

33:46.768 --> 33:48.769
I'll get you another two
by the end of the night.

33:48.794 --> 33:49.788
Fantastic.

33:49.813 --> 33:51.614
Only 40K to go and your debt's paid.

33:51.639 --> 33:53.192
You said you were gonna knock
off a couple thousand for

33:53.217 --> 33:56.388
- that... that other thing that I did for you.
- I did.

33:56.414 --> 33:58.615
That doesn't stop your
interest from going up.

33:58.640 --> 34:00.352
All right... Hey, listen,
man, I'm gonna need an

34:00.377 --> 34:01.711
extension this month, at least until we get

34:01.736 --> 34:03.467
a few more of these parties off the ground.

34:03.492 --> 34:05.861
Look, Jared, I like you. I like your bar.

34:05.886 --> 34:07.772
That's why when you came to me
and said you needed 50 grand

34:07.797 --> 34:10.297
or you'd lose the place,
I loaned it to you.

34:10.322 --> 34:11.422
I saved your ass.

34:11.447 --> 34:13.009
But we're coming up on six months here

34:13.034 --> 34:15.502
and your interest is reaching
an untenable tipping point.

34:15.534 --> 34:17.402
- Rick, I am trying.
- I know.

34:17.427 --> 34:18.982
But now it's starting to hurt my business.

34:19.007 --> 34:21.998
So I'm gonna need you to be
paid up, in full, by the first.

34:22.023 --> 34:23.025
Or what?

34:23.050 --> 34:25.786
Or you're not gonna like what comes next.

34:28.585 --> 34:30.301
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:30.326 --> 34:31.561
Who was that?

34:31.585 --> 34:33.353
Oh, he was just looking for the restroom.

34:33.378 --> 34:34.679
- What's up?
- Um...

34:34.704 --> 34:36.871
I just caught Ben dealing.

34:36.897 --> 34:38.163
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

34:38.188 --> 34:39.889
- Yeah, I kicked him out.
- Good.

34:39.914 --> 34:42.036
Yeah, I mean...  That's good.

34:42.062 --> 34:44.717
We can't have people dealing
out in the open like that.

34:44.742 --> 34:47.965
It's such a crazy night.
Would you kiss me already?

34:52.638 --> 34:55.204
- Seriously?
- What?

34:55.228 --> 34:56.996
- Hey!
- You said you'd get rid of it.

34:57.022 --> 34:59.553
I am going to, I just figured we'd need

34:59.578 --> 35:00.879
a little extra security for tonight.

35:00.947 --> 35:02.880
What, in case you needed to shoot somebody?

35:02.905 --> 35:05.159
All right, it's not loaded, okay?

35:05.184 --> 35:07.542
It's just for show.

35:07.567 --> 35:10.230
I didn't tell you because I
know how you feel about guns.

35:10.255 --> 35:11.722
And yet you brought it anyway.

35:11.747 --> 35:14.862
Are we gonna have this fight
in the middle of our party?

35:16.585 --> 35:18.265
What?

35:18.290 --> 35:19.557
No, I'm just wondering where the hell

35:19.582 --> 35:21.382
the guy I moved in with went.

35:21.407 --> 35:23.935
I have absolutely no idea who this guy is.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.276
Look, I...

35:27.301 --> 35:30.286
I'm still the same guy, okay?

35:30.311 --> 35:32.245
Carter, something's wrong with Seth!

35:32.270 --> 35:34.146
He came up here, like, ten
minutes ago to lay down,

35:34.171 --> 35:35.487
he said he felt sick!

35:35.512 --> 35:37.424
Seth, Seth!

35:39.344 --> 35:41.278
Oh, my God, what's happening?

35:41.303 --> 35:42.646
Hey, hey!

35:42.671 --> 35:44.716
Call 9-1-1, okay? Meet them out front!

35:44.741 --> 35:47.637
Go, come on! Hey, hey, Seth, Seth.

35:48.427 --> 35:50.223
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Seth!

35:50.248 --> 35:51.648
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy, wake up!

35:51.673 --> 35:53.737
No!

36:05.187 --> 36:06.614
Come on!

36:06.639 --> 36:08.189
Come on!

36:18.029 --> 36:20.947
He's dead.

36:24.863 --> 36:26.696
What do we do?

36:26.721 --> 36:28.435
Let me think.

36:35.143 --> 36:36.265
We gotta get him out of here.

36:36.290 --> 36:38.103
- Grab his legs.
- What? Why?

36:38.128 --> 36:41.067
- Jared, stop!
- Carter, he obviously OD'd, okay?

36:41.092 --> 36:42.459
If the paramedics find him in here,

36:42.484 --> 36:43.584
the cops are gonna be all over us.

36:43.609 --> 36:44.996
Why? We didn't do anything wrong.

36:45.021 --> 36:47.408
- He obviously took something.
- Carter, we could get sued.

36:47.433 --> 36:48.796
We could go to jail,
or God knows what else.

36:48.821 --> 36:50.589
Is that what you're
thinking about right now?

36:50.614 --> 36:52.282
If we get him off the property,
at least we're protected.

36:52.307 --> 36:53.848
- I'm not doing that, Jared.
- Come on,

36:53.873 --> 36:55.984
- We don't have a lot of time, okay?
- What are you talking about?

36:56.009 --> 36:57.936
Help me with this!

36:58.668 --> 37:01.262
He's our friend, Jared.

37:01.287 --> 37:04.270
I did everything I could
to try and save him, okay?

37:04.295 --> 37:07.262
Now I'm trying to save us.

37:07.287 --> 37:09.741
I don't care, I'm not doing it.

37:09.766 --> 37:11.918
Fine. I'll do it myself.

37:22.479 --> 37:24.887
- I'm such an idiot.
- Hey, don't say that.

37:24.921 --> 37:26.679
I let him through the door.

37:26.704 --> 37:28.599
I put you in harm's way.

37:28.624 --> 37:31.892
Yeah, but it's okay. It's over, I'm fine.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.595
Do you really have to go?

37:34.680 --> 37:36.873
Can't you just stay for one more night?

37:36.898 --> 37:38.432
We gotta get back.

37:38.457 --> 37:41.228
You should think about
what we talked about.

37:41.253 --> 37:43.321
You moving near me.

37:43.346 --> 37:46.181
I will.

37:46.566 --> 37:48.489
I... I want to write down

37:48.514 --> 37:51.643
that recipe for my spaghetti
sauce you like so much.

37:51.675 --> 37:53.917
- Okay.
- Don't move.

38:00.066 --> 38:02.234
When you said that he...

38:02.259 --> 38:05.393
had you fooled, was that true?

38:05.606 --> 38:07.422
Did you really believe he'd changed?

38:07.447 --> 38:09.381
I wanted to.

38:09.826 --> 38:11.854
But I had to find out for sure.

38:11.879 --> 38:14.314
So you provoked him on purpose.

38:14.339 --> 38:17.438
She doesn't need to know that.

38:17.862 --> 38:20.183
She feels guilty enough.

38:20.208 --> 38:22.798
Kinda the greatest son ever.

38:22.823 --> 38:25.958
You know I would do the same thing for you.

38:25.983 --> 38:27.384
I do know.

38:27.409 --> 38:29.344
I mean that.

38:29.743 --> 38:32.356
If there was ever a chance
of you getting hurt,

38:32.381 --> 38:36.787
there is nothing I would
not do to protect you.

No, it's blast, Mom, blast.
