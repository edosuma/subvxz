WEBVTT

01:42.953 --> 01:45.623
Here it is, trying to buy
the pot. Here he goes.

01:45.655 --> 01:46.757
Buying the pot.

01:46.791 --> 01:49.459
-He doesn't have enough to buy it.
-Buying the pot.

01:49.492 --> 01:51.762
What do you got?

01:51.795 --> 01:54.565
Let's see 'em.

01:54.598 --> 01:57.301
-That's lucky.
-No he has.

01:57.302 --> 01:58.902
That's a flush.

01:58.934 --> 02:00.702
-He had a flush...
-You're lucky.

02:00.735 --> 02:02.238
-It's called being The Champ.
-That's what it's called.

02:02.271 --> 02:07.342
I'll give you "The Champ". Take your
God damned money there, fuckin' punk.

02:07.375 --> 02:11.312
Thank you very much! Fuck yeah.

02:11.347 --> 02:15.584
Fuckin' stripper girls on me
tonight, boys.

02:15.617 --> 02:16.853
It's gettin' cold, boys.

02:16.884 --> 02:21.323
I could share some of this with
you gentlemen, if you'd like.

02:21.355 --> 02:24.525
It is the first of November.

02:24.558 --> 02:27.329
Well, look at this.

02:27.361 --> 02:31.733
One month from today, I'll be sippin'
margaritas with the lady in Florida.

02:31.764 --> 02:36.436
-Florida?
-Every year, baby. Christmas in Florida.

02:36.470 --> 02:39.607
Margaritas?

02:39.639 --> 02:42.241
Is that, Disney World or
Disney Land in Florida?

02:42.242 --> 02:43.543
What was that, excuse me?

02:43.577 --> 02:46.280
Is it Disney World or
Disney Land in Florida?

02:46.312 --> 02:48.381
PPAh, fuck Disney World.

02:48.414 --> 02:50.984
I'm there for the women, dude.
I'm a grown man.

02:51.018 --> 02:52.852
The women and your girl?

02:52.885 --> 02:54.753
Well...

02:54.787 --> 02:59.659
That's what this money will
help me get, right?

02:59.691 --> 03:00.759
Well

03:00.792 --> 03:03.395
I like a white winter.

03:04.564 --> 03:06.631
So what's the deal, you staying
here again this year?

03:06.666 --> 03:08.467
Yeah. Fuck.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.401
I love it up here, you know.

03:09.435 --> 03:12.004
You poor son of a bitch.

03:12.037 --> 03:13.439
Stupid.

03:13.471 --> 03:16.674
-Alright.
-I like the double pay, man.

03:16.708 --> 03:19.478
I'll need it after this poker
game.

03:19.511 --> 03:21.313
Double pay, right...

03:21.345 --> 03:23.448
I wanna see this. C'mon, give
me something good here.

03:23.482 --> 03:24.817
Let's see what we got here.

03:24.850 --> 03:27.820
Here we go. Game on, bud.

03:49.307 --> 03:50.475
<i>Jensen!</i>

03:50.506 --> 03:53.909
<i>-Jensen, come in!
-Fuck me!</i>

03:53.943 --> 03:58.315
<i>Chopper's comin' in.
We got company.</i>

03:58.347 --> 04:01.517
<i>Outpost NTC-291,
this is DBA Transport.</i>

04:01.551 --> 04:07.290
<i>Stand by for landing...</i>

05:19.923 --> 05:24.096
Check. Check.

05:28.466 --> 05:29.735
Fold.

05:29.767 --> 05:31.135
Alright, everyone.
This is Professor Olsen.

05:31.169 --> 05:35.407
Head of archaeology for U of T.
Head of field research for the SAA.

05:35.440 --> 05:39.777
Professor, Francis Månro, project
director. Pleasure to meet you.

05:39.810 --> 05:42.813
Likewise. I did a paper
on you in University.

05:42.845 --> 05:48.052
That's Drew McNaughton, he's
our equipment technician.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.954
And Robert Michael Giles,
field supervisor.

05:49.987 --> 05:52.689
What he's doing here and not
on site is beyond me.

05:52.723 --> 05:54.191
I'm on my break.

05:54.225 --> 05:57.460
And that's, Dr. Richard Andervs,
site assigned medical supervisor.

05:57.494 --> 05:58.496
-Pleasure to meet ya.
-Likewise.

05:58.527 --> 06:00.429
Let me know if
you need anything,

06:00.462 --> 06:04.167
It would be nice to do something
around here for a change.

06:04.200 --> 06:08.737
Let me show you the lab.

06:08.770 --> 06:09.806
-You want in here?
-Yeah.

06:09.838 --> 06:14.643
Alrighty.

06:14.676 --> 06:15.810
Do it up.

06:17.512 --> 06:20.516
And this is Steven Welles, he's
here on a corporate internship

06:20.548 --> 06:22.617
with a company in Calgary.

06:22.651 --> 06:24.853
He's been my assistant for the
past few months.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.888
-How's it going?
-Well, thank you.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.423
You've got a very
impressive resume.

06:29.457 --> 06:30.859
Thank you.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.827
Professor Olsen is here to write a
report to hopefully get us a grant

06:32.859 --> 06:34.294
from the SSHRC to get us more
funding and more hands.

06:34.329 --> 06:38.499
Hey, that would be great. I really
look forward to working with you.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.901
Likewise.

06:39.934 --> 06:41.835
So, how was the trip in?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.470
Long.

06:43.504 --> 06:46.040
Yeah, it's a long ride on that chopper.
You're lucky, it's three times as long

06:46.072 --> 06:48.175
if you were to ride
up during a storm.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.609
Is it usually this cold out?

06:49.642 --> 06:53.046
It's not usually this warm.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.180
-Really?
-Yeah.

06:54.214 --> 06:56.149
So I...

06:56.181 --> 06:58.851
Bet you're wondering why they
sent you up to

06:58.885 --> 07:02.522
a Northern Paleo Indian outpost.
Something like that, yeah.

07:02.554 --> 07:04.557
I'm curious what they told you.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.659
Unusual Clovis findings.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.094
That's all?

07:08.126 --> 07:09.929
They were pretty
vague with the details.

07:09.961 --> 07:14.666
Yeah, we were pretty stingy
with the details ourselves.

07:14.699 --> 07:16.468
It's pretty standard, right?

07:16.502 --> 07:19.472
Yeah, I'd say. Standard Clovis
culture. Yeah.

07:19.504 --> 07:22.975
The past three years we've stationed
here, that's all we've dug up.

07:23.006 --> 07:26.144
11,000 B.C.E. Clovis.

07:26.177 --> 07:30.249
It's pretty interesting stuff.
Nothing too exciting though.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.048
Right.

07:31.082 --> 07:35.954
Two weeks ago,
we found this pot.

07:35.986 --> 07:38.922
11,000 B.C.E. Clovis pottery.

07:38.955 --> 07:40.890
It's interesting, but not
impossible.

07:40.924 --> 07:42.892
Yeah, that's not what's
interesting, though.

07:42.926 --> 07:47.197
We found it under sediment
dated to 14,000 B.P.

07:47.231 --> 07:49.665
14,000 B.P. Clovis pottery.

07:49.699 --> 07:52.069
Nope, not Clovis.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.569
Pre-Clovis pottery?

07:53.603 --> 07:56.272
Mesoamerican.

07:56.305 --> 07:58.174
I mean, it looks Mesoamerican.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.076
It's got similar
symbols and markings.

08:00.110 --> 08:04.982
We're over 4,000 miles from the
nearest Mesoamerican site.

08:05.013 --> 08:08.150
There's one hundred different
reasons for this being here.

08:08.184 --> 08:10.953
Early trade activity in this
area,

08:10.986 --> 08:14.090
ceremonial burial of a more recent
culture. Something like that.

08:14.123 --> 08:17.158
Right, but 14,000 B.P.?

08:17.191 --> 08:20.862
Well, you know that radio-carbon
dating's not always accurate.

08:20.895 --> 08:22.765
Right...

08:22.796 --> 08:26.700
We've also started unearthing a
structure.

08:26.733 --> 08:27.935
A structure?

08:27.969 --> 08:31.906
A week ago, we began unearthing
a large object that we think

08:31.940 --> 08:34.542
is the roof of a structure that
goes down...

08:34.575 --> 08:36.844
Well, really far.

08:36.876 --> 08:37.845
How far?

08:37.876 --> 08:39.412
Maybe a meter. Maybe ten meters.
We don't know.

08:39.446 --> 08:43.650
We don't want to jump to any conclusions
here. I mean, it could be nothing.

08:43.683 --> 08:45.819
It could be planted...
We don't know.

08:45.852 --> 08:47.353
Right. But...

08:47.386 --> 08:50.623
If this is the real deal, then we're
looking at one of the biggest finds

08:50.656 --> 08:54.727
in the past century. We are right in
the middle of the ice-free corridor

08:54.760 --> 08:59.533
and this could confirm that
theory.

09:04.770 --> 09:09.808
Over the past three years we've covered
over two square kilometers of ground.

09:09.842 --> 09:15.582
Going as deep as
12,000 B.P. of sediment.

09:15.614 --> 09:18.284
Have a good night.

09:18.316 --> 09:20.118
Any of them speak English?

09:20.150 --> 09:21.585
All of 'em.

09:21.619 --> 09:24.354
They speak Dogrib with one another,
but they're all fluent in English.

09:24.389 --> 09:27.359
Any of them have experience
with Archaeology?

09:27.392 --> 09:28.794
Not one of 'em.

09:28.825 --> 09:31.027
No, they're all from a reserve about
a hundred miles south of here.

09:31.062 --> 09:35.934
We just pay the, band council
and they give us workers.

09:39.202 --> 09:41.271
Usually finish this early?

09:41.305 --> 09:43.174
We don't get much sunlight up
here.

09:43.206 --> 09:46.076
And when the sun isn't
up, it hits fifty below.

09:46.108 --> 09:47.310
Sun goes down real fast.

09:47.344 --> 09:49.813
Yeah, get stuck out here for
long and your blood will freeze.

09:49.846 --> 09:54.183
I wouldn't want to be the poor son of
a bitch to have to experience that.

09:54.218 --> 09:58.154
Okay, gentlemen. Thank you
again.

09:58.186 --> 09:59.922
How many hours of sunlight do
you get?

09:59.955 --> 10:01.957
What, this time of year?
I don't no.

10:01.990 --> 10:03.326
Like five... Five and a half.

10:03.358 --> 10:07.329
You know, we try to use as we can
but come December and January

10:07.362 --> 10:11.666
we barely get any at all.

10:11.700 --> 10:14.969
So, what do you do with the
other nineteen hours?

10:15.002 --> 10:19.342
Drink, mostly.

10:26.081 --> 10:31.319
Welles and Månro sleep there.

10:31.351 --> 10:33.920
That's my office, and

10:33.953 --> 10:36.189
there's the communication cabin.

10:36.222 --> 10:37.724
That's where Jensen is.

10:37.758 --> 10:42.129
And McNaughton and Giles, they have
their own cabins; They're over there.

10:42.163 --> 10:46.700
And, this is us.

10:46.734 --> 10:51.338
Home, sweet home.

10:59.144 --> 11:00.278
That's me.

11:00.311 --> 11:04.082
Ramis, the site chef; He sleeps
in there.

11:04.116 --> 11:06.351
It's pretty small.

11:06.384 --> 11:08.086
Cozy.

11:08.119 --> 11:09.921
It's a shit hole.

11:09.955 --> 11:12.157
You're upstairs, c'mon. I'll
show ya.

11:20.398 --> 11:22.132
And, finally, your room.

11:22.165 --> 11:24.736
Bed's kind of shitty, but it'll
do the trick.

11:24.768 --> 11:27.372
That heater takes about an hour
to start to work, so...

11:27.405 --> 11:30.074
Sometimes you gotta smack it
around a little.

11:30.108 --> 11:31.510
You're gonna need blankets,
pillows...

11:31.542 --> 11:35.179
There's a stack of that stuff in
laundry room; It's the next room over.

11:35.213 --> 11:37.382
By the way, it gets kind of
loud.

11:37.414 --> 11:39.851
-Wonderful.
-Yeah, it sounds shitty, but

11:39.883 --> 11:43.353
there's a little vent there that siphons
hot air from the machines into this room

11:43.386 --> 11:47.790
so it's actually not that shitty.
Believe me, in a couple of days

11:47.823 --> 11:53.764
you're gonna be thankful we
gave you this room.

11:53.795 --> 11:57.466
Enjoy.

12:18.353 --> 12:22.124
Hey, puss.

12:24.091 --> 12:29.331
Gibson, get off the table.

12:29.363 --> 12:30.297
Gibson!

12:33.401 --> 12:34.502
Okay.

12:34.535 --> 12:35.203
Beat it.

12:35.235 --> 12:38.404
-Bye, puss.
-We're out of eggs.

12:38.437 --> 12:42.475
Alright... Anything else?

12:42.508 --> 12:46.781
Yeah, we'll be out of milk soon.

12:46.814 --> 12:51.384
Okay, I'll radio it in tomorrow.

13:21.378 --> 13:24.116
How many more sites like this
are there?

13:24.149 --> 13:28.152
There's a site like this, one
every hundred miles or so.

13:28.184 --> 13:31.521
Two dozen spread across
the whole area.

13:31.554 --> 13:35.058
Any of the other ones have
anything like this?

13:35.091 --> 13:40.530
Not that we've heard of.
We're out of radio range.

13:40.562 --> 13:44.302
I was reviewing some of the
photos last night.

13:44.334 --> 13:46.571
If you look here, these

13:46.603 --> 13:50.306
kind of look like
symbols of a Trecena.

13:50.340 --> 13:53.509
It's a Mesoamerican
period of time.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.846
It's similar, but it's faded

13:56.879 --> 13:58.613
so it's hard to tell.

13:58.648 --> 14:01.884
Maybe a simplified version.

14:01.916 --> 14:04.354
Now, if you look over here,

14:04.386 --> 14:07.924
that's nothing. It's just an
image. Maybe a hunting ritual?

14:07.955 --> 14:14.162
Something like that.

14:14.195 --> 14:16.598
How far down do
you think it goes?

14:16.632 --> 14:17.733
No clue.

14:17.767 --> 14:21.136
Based on the depth of
the bedrock in the area, I'd say

14:21.168 --> 14:25.573
-three feet.
-Maybe as many as ten feet.

14:34.915 --> 14:38.319
Outpost NTC-291 calling
Station-9, over.

14:45.592 --> 14:51.465
Outpost NTC-291, calling
Station-9, over.

14:51.497 --> 14:55.001
<i>This is Station-9, what can we
do for you, 291? Over.</i>

14:55.033 --> 14:57.035
Hey, how ya doin', Station-9?

14:57.069 --> 15:01.908
When's the next supply
drop at this location? Over.

15:01.942 --> 15:08.180
<i>Hold on a minute. Let me check
that for you, 291,</i>

15:08.212 --> 15:10.283
<i>Sunday, November 10th.</i>

15:10.315 --> 15:14.954
<i>In three days, 291. Over.</i>

15:14.985 --> 15:17.288
Okay great.

15:17.322 --> 15:19.524
Can you add...

15:19.556 --> 15:22.226
Let's see. Hang on one
second here.

15:22.259 --> 15:28.298
Milk, cigarettes, and eggs to
the list, please? Over.

15:28.332 --> 15:33.404
<i>Sure can do, 291. Eggs,
milk and cigarettes. Over.</i>

15:33.437 --> 15:39.310
Great, thanks a lot.
Over and out.

15:41.143 --> 15:43.647
Hunker down with a
bottle of Whiskey and a

15:43.679 --> 15:49.552
box of porn. Yeah, well
it's much deserved, anyway.

15:49.585 --> 15:53.367
-To whiskey and porn.
-To whiskey and porn!

15:53.403 --> 15:55.257
There it is. Cheers for that.

15:55.290 --> 15:58.627
You know what,
while on the subject,

15:58.661 --> 16:01.229
how about a toast,

16:01.262 --> 16:03.498
-to the crew...
-Yep.

16:03.531 --> 16:05.534
Who will be remembered...

16:05.568 --> 16:08.236
For the greatest
archaeological find.

16:08.270 --> 16:09.303
Yeah.

16:09.337 --> 16:10.505
-Possibly ever.
-Alright.

16:10.506 --> 16:11.673
I like the sound of that.

16:11.706 --> 16:13.051
-Cheers!
-Gentlemen.

16:13.052 --> 16:16.211
Cheers.

16:16.244 --> 16:20.248
And you'll be remembered as the guy
who sat on his ass the whole time

16:20.280 --> 16:22.483
it was happening.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.051
I,

16:24.084 --> 16:27.122
I'm okay with that.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.358
So, what do you think, Doc?

16:31.392 --> 16:33.294
What do I think about what?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.495
About that temple out there?

16:35.528 --> 16:36.896
What do I think?

16:36.931 --> 16:40.735
Who gives a damn what I think? I'm
a doctor, not an archaeologist.

16:43.437 --> 16:44.404
It doesn't get old, does it?

16:44.437 --> 16:47.573
No.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.641
Jesus Christ...

16:49.675 --> 16:51.644
Olsen!

16:51.676 --> 16:54.546
What do you think?

16:54.580 --> 16:56.449
About the temple?

16:56.481 --> 16:59.018
-It's probably not a temple.
-Whatever, you know... How,

16:59.050 --> 17:00.651
how far do you
think it goes down?

17:00.686 --> 17:04.790
Just based on experience...
If I was looking at a

17:04.823 --> 17:08.393
similar structure, in the
Amazon, based on

17:08.426 --> 17:12.464
shape, size, some of the
defining characteristics

17:12.497 --> 17:16.167
I would put it about...
20,000 B.C.E.,

17:16.200 --> 17:20.439
which is, well, not possible.

17:20.471 --> 17:21.506
Well.

17:21.539 --> 17:28.211
-You know what I think?
-Yeah, what do you think?

17:28.244 --> 17:30.281
Aliens.

17:32.349 --> 17:33.550
That's just...

17:33.583 --> 17:36.754
Hey, hey. You laugh now, but
wait until we start pulling up

17:36.785 --> 17:39.222
little green bodies.

17:39.255 --> 17:42.760
You're a God damned idiot.

17:50.365 --> 17:52.067
Where's the file on Alpha-226?

17:52.101 --> 17:56.806
Alpha 200 to Alpha 250 is
listed under fifty-nine.

17:57.774 --> 18:00.476
Well this one is labeled one
hundred.

18:00.508 --> 18:04.780
Red files are one hundred, blue
files are two-hundred.

18:09.850 --> 18:11.252
Fuck.

18:11.285 --> 18:14.321
This is giving me a headache.

18:14.356 --> 18:18.661
Why don't you
just call it a day?

18:18.693 --> 18:23.665
Yeah, maybe I will.

18:37.344 --> 18:40.081
<i>Come in, Jensen. Over.</i>

18:44.783 --> 18:47.720
What's up, Giles?

18:47.753 --> 18:50.388
<i>Can you come down to the site?</i>

18:50.423 --> 18:53.227
<i>I think you better see this.</i>

18:53.259 --> 18:55.728
Yeah, I'll, be right down.

18:55.761 --> 18:56.463
Over.

19:03.536 --> 19:05.605
What the hell?

19:05.637 --> 19:06.738
What is that?

19:06.770 --> 19:08.575
It's Ramis' cat.

19:10.408 --> 19:13.712
Jesus Christ, who did this?

19:13.744 --> 19:16.680
I don't no.

19:16.713 --> 19:18.215
One of the workers?

19:18.249 --> 19:21.685
Why would they do it?

19:21.719 --> 19:25.390
This is fucked up.

19:32.461 --> 19:34.498
McNaughton?

19:34.531 --> 19:35.765
Yes.

19:35.798 --> 19:37.600
Why would McNaughton
kill the cat?

19:37.634 --> 19:41.372
I don't know.

19:41.403 --> 19:45.674
-You saw this happen?
-Yeah.

19:48.744 --> 19:49.846
Okay.

19:49.879 --> 19:51.915
Okay.

19:51.948 --> 19:56.319
I'll look into it.
You can go back to work.

20:02.490 --> 20:06.428
This makes no sense.

20:09.898 --> 20:14.336
Hey McNaughton, come in.

20:14.369 --> 20:16.305
Yeah?

20:16.337 --> 20:20.408
Did you kill Ramis' cat?

20:20.440 --> 20:21.409
No.

20:21.441 --> 20:23.544
Well then, who did?

20:23.577 --> 20:26.580
I don't no.

20:26.613 --> 20:31.552
Navaron just came into my office,
he said he saw you doin' it.

20:31.584 --> 20:32.886
He saw me do it?

20:32.919 --> 20:37.291
That's what he says.

20:38.925 --> 20:40.594
Nope, I didn't do it.

20:40.628 --> 20:44.464
You'll figure it out.
I believe in you, buddy.

20:44.496 --> 20:47.466
Copy.

20:47.499 --> 20:48.201
Okay...

20:58.511 --> 21:03.549
Would someone please tell me
what the fuck is going on?

21:03.581 --> 21:09.854
Just get up here, McNaughton, I'll tell
you everything when you get here, okay?

21:10.956 --> 21:16.594
Hey Doc, wake up. I need you
out here right now.

21:16.627 --> 21:19.731
What the fuck is going on?

21:19.763 --> 21:21.531
Jesus Christ.

21:21.564 --> 21:22.799
What's going on?

21:22.832 --> 21:25.402
Three of our guys are gone. The
other two went lookin' for 'em.

21:25.435 --> 21:27.738
Three of the workers? Yeah.

21:27.772 --> 21:32.608
Giles still here? Yeah.

21:32.642 --> 21:33.809
What do you mean, gone?

21:33.842 --> 21:35.911
I mean they're gone, what the
fuck do you think I mean?

21:35.944 --> 21:38.448
Well, why, man? I have
no idea why! Guys, guys!

21:38.481 --> 21:40.850
The workers are all gone.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.653
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

21:42.685 --> 21:45.289
-All but two.
-What about Giles?

21:45.320 --> 21:46.222
Not Giles.

21:46.257 --> 21:51.294
-You didn't hear 'em leave?
-No, I didn't.

21:51.328 --> 21:54.931
There's some tracks from the
cabin, going to the reserve.

21:54.962 --> 21:57.700
-There going back to the rez?
-I don't no, I guess so.

21:57.732 --> 22:00.368
What? Walking? Apparently.

22:01.970 --> 22:04.539
This is fucking great.

22:06.841 --> 22:11.645
Three weeks before wrap, you
think they'll send more guys?

22:11.679 --> 22:13.147
I doubt it.

22:13.181 --> 22:16.951
Why would they leave in the middle
of the night when it's fifty below?

22:16.984 --> 22:19.687
Maybe they got spooked.

22:19.721 --> 22:20.756
Spooked?

22:20.788 --> 22:23.892
I don't no. They believe in all
sorts of wacky shit.

22:23.924 --> 22:25.693
Maybe something spooked 'em.

22:25.727 --> 22:28.797
Yeah? Like what?

22:28.828 --> 22:30.597
The cat?

22:30.630 --> 22:33.567
Yeah. Maybe the cat.

22:33.599 --> 22:35.368
You know, it's possible.

22:35.402 --> 22:38.471
They are a pretty superstitious
people.

22:38.505 --> 22:41.440
So, they see the dead cat,
freak out, and leave?

22:41.474 --> 22:43.608
And then wait until the middle
of the night?

22:43.643 --> 22:47.412
I don't no. Maybe it was the cat in
combination with something else.

22:47.447 --> 22:52.051
You know, an animal sighting or something.
What do you mean, an animal sighting?

22:52.084 --> 22:56.889
Animals have a lot of
significance in Dogrib mythology.

22:56.920 --> 23:00.991
They can come in the form of
demons, gods, or whatever.

23:01.026 --> 23:06.733
So these guys see a moose in
the camp and run for the hills?

23:06.765 --> 23:09.935
Well, regardless, we can't
work without more guys.

23:09.968 --> 23:12.070
I'm going to call it in.

23:21.712 --> 23:23.881
Well, I wouldn't say no
to an early winter break.

23:23.914 --> 23:28.085
Five months alone here is
more than enough.

23:28.118 --> 23:30.388
What happened to
"can't say no..."

23:30.420 --> 23:32.823
Jesus Christ!

23:32.855 --> 23:34.691
What the hell is wrong with him?

23:37.427 --> 23:39.928
-He's got no fever.
-What did you eat?

23:39.963 --> 23:41.665
I don't no, the same
shit you guys ate.

23:41.697 --> 23:47.437
Alright, let's get to my
office. Let's go look at ya.

23:51.640 --> 23:55.144
Jesus Christ.

24:03.017 --> 24:07.922
Come in Station-9. Over.

24:15.663 --> 24:20.135
Station-9, come in. Over.

24:32.045 --> 24:36.584
Station-9, come in. Over.

24:43.722 --> 24:48.895
Station-9, are you there?
Come in, please. Over.

24:58.769 --> 25:00.472
So, what's the word?
We goin' home? Or...

25:00.506 --> 25:03.976
No, I couldn't get
a hold of anyone.

25:04.009 --> 25:05.978
What the hell's all this?

25:06.009 --> 25:08.947
Welles threw up.

25:08.980 --> 25:10.548
Is he okay?

25:10.580 --> 25:13.851
I think so.

25:13.884 --> 25:16.721
So what do we do?

25:16.753 --> 25:22.626
Go back to work until we can
get a hold of someone.

25:37.641 --> 25:40.677
Alright. Keep those walkies
tuned to the worker's channel,

25:40.710 --> 25:43.514
that's channel 3. And keep an
ear by the two-way.

25:43.545 --> 25:47.784
If anyone calls, we'll be back
before dark, alright?

25:47.815 --> 25:49.619
Yeah, yeah. If it's Station-9,
tell them to send an E-Vac.

25:49.651 --> 25:51.120
Yeah, yeah. Look, I know
it sounds trivial, but

25:51.152 --> 25:52.688
it's important. I don't
care if you have to

25:52.720 --> 25:57.593
take those radios with you when you take
a shit. Just stay by them, alright?

25:57.625 --> 26:00.528
Okay.

26:25.719 --> 26:27.755
Still feel like shit?

26:27.787 --> 26:29.756
Yeah.

26:29.790 --> 26:33.093
And you've been feeling progressively
worse throughout the week?

26:33.126 --> 26:36.162
Yeah.

26:36.196 --> 26:38.599
Any conditions? Anything?

26:38.631 --> 26:42.634
Not that I know about.

26:42.667 --> 26:46.805
Alright. How've
you been sleeping?

26:46.839 --> 26:47.274
I'm not.

26:52.911 --> 26:55.147
Open your mouth.

27:01.386 --> 27:04.089
Okay.

27:04.121 --> 27:06.090
My best bet is

27:06.124 --> 27:08.660
you got a real bad flu.

27:08.693 --> 27:10.027
How'd I get it?

27:10.061 --> 27:14.265
Well, sometimes, someone has a
virus, but they have the antibodies

27:14.298 --> 27:17.135
so they don't even realize
they're contagious. Right.

27:17.167 --> 27:18.436
Then, they give it to someone
else

27:18.469 --> 27:21.639
and they don't have the antibodies,
and then they get sick.

27:21.672 --> 27:27.044
I'm going to give you some new pain killers,
and some Triazolam; It'll help you sleep.

27:27.077 --> 27:27.712
Alright?

27:48.397 --> 27:52.266
Think they went home?

27:53.703 --> 27:55.136
Just doesn't make any sense.

27:55.171 --> 27:58.907
I mean, they don't have any of their
stuff. They've got no supplies.

27:58.940 --> 28:02.044
They're not gonna make it very
far. Not in this weather.

28:02.077 --> 28:04.413
Fuck, it's cold.

28:04.444 --> 28:05.145
Yeah.

28:09.916 --> 28:12.220
What's wrong?

28:12.253 --> 28:15.722
Has anyone else been up here?

28:15.757 --> 28:16.958
Why?

28:23.264 --> 28:25.066
What? We lost?

28:29.268 --> 28:31.338
We're not.

28:32.338 --> 28:34.740
But these tracks aren't
going to the reservation.

28:34.774 --> 28:37.010
They're going in the
complete opposite direction.

28:37.043 --> 28:40.280
No one's been out here as far
as I can tell.

28:40.313 --> 28:44.818
These tracks are headed north.
Reservation's south.

28:44.851 --> 28:49.890
Well if they're headed north,
they're definitely dead.

29:10.874 --> 29:15.946
It's not in bad condition
considering it's 11,000 years old.

29:15.979 --> 29:17.247
Yeah, well nothing comes up
here.

29:17.282 --> 29:20.452
On top of that, it's all untouched;
Buried beneath snow and ice.

29:20.485 --> 29:23.486
The reserve where the workers are
from, they don't come up here ever?

29:23.520 --> 29:28.426
No, the town they all took off to is the
northern most town for hundreds of miles.

29:28.457 --> 29:30.360
Really?
Yep.

29:30.392 --> 29:32.862
We're the northern most outpost.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.865
291 out of 291.

29:36.998 --> 29:39.201
Stop that.

29:42.071 --> 29:46.042
Most northern outpost by about
ninety miles.

29:46.074 --> 29:47.876
So what comes up here, then?

29:47.910 --> 29:49.311
Nothing.

29:49.344 --> 29:50.812
So, why are we here?

29:50.846 --> 29:55.284
Same reason 290 is there. And
250...

29:55.317 --> 29:57.452
226, 215...

29:57.485 --> 30:00.089
Some surveyor found some
scribble on a rock

30:00.121 --> 30:02.924
and figured it was important
enough to waste years of

30:02.956 --> 30:04.792
people's time and government
money.

30:04.826 --> 30:07.163
Yeah, nothing comes up
this far north through

30:07.195 --> 30:09.964
these mountains except for
the odd charter plane.

30:09.997 --> 30:14.468
Even those stopped coming up here after
that one went down, fifty miles from here.

30:14.502 --> 30:18.338
Engine failure, from the cold.

30:18.372 --> 30:21.508
So what motivated them to build
a camp here?

30:21.542 --> 30:23.810
Rock pile formations, the usual
stuff.

30:23.845 --> 30:28.048
You can see the initial reports.
Jensen's got 'em in his office...

30:28.080 --> 30:29.550
Stop that!

30:32.386 --> 30:36.388
Same old stupid shit.

31:04.115 --> 31:08.319
-You wanna pass me that can?
-This one? I guess it's

31:08.352 --> 31:12.191
empty. We've got...
Three more cans back in

31:12.222 --> 31:16.961
storage. How long can we go for?
I say we got supplies

31:16.993 --> 31:20.564
for, two weeks. At the most.

31:20.597 --> 31:25.502
Supply drop was supposed to
be three days ago? Yeah.

31:25.535 --> 31:29.406
Fuck.

31:41.985 --> 31:45.622
Okay.

31:45.654 --> 31:50.226
We're on for now.

32:07.208 --> 32:11.980
Just put it down there.

32:12.013 --> 32:13.114
Is it on?

32:13.148 --> 32:14.582
Yeah, okay? I told you,
this thing works fine.

32:14.614 --> 32:17.150
I just wanna see.

32:17.184 --> 32:19.187
Test, test.

32:24.190 --> 32:27.994
Turn the dial.

32:28.027 --> 32:32.331
The dial?

32:32.364 --> 32:35.434
Test, test.

32:40.572 --> 32:43.643
Try ninety-eight.

32:47.346 --> 32:50.117
Test, test.

32:50.148 --> 32:52.051
See, it works.

32:53.718 --> 32:56.487
They must have theirs turned
off.

32:56.522 --> 32:58.089
Or they aren't there.

32:58.122 --> 33:03.295
Maybe there's a storm on the
other side. Who knows?

33:03.328 --> 33:06.499
Well, just rig a loop to
ninety-eight.

33:06.531 --> 33:08.399
Okay?

33:30.721 --> 33:36.160
Yeah, there are, stone piles like this,
one every couple of miles or so.

33:36.193 --> 33:39.295
They're all about a mile from
my initial dig spot,

33:39.327 --> 33:43.233
where we found most of the
Clovis points.

33:43.665 --> 33:46.135
This means the Dogrib
knew about the temple?

33:46.167 --> 33:48.236
Nope. That's likely
just a coincidence.

33:48.269 --> 33:51.974
Stone piles like these are really
common among native cultures.

33:52.007 --> 33:55.677
They're used to mark important
spots like,

33:55.710 --> 33:59.015
ceremonial burial grounds
or recurring settlements.

33:59.047 --> 34:02.384
Our theory is, that these were
used to mark a

34:02.416 --> 34:04.752
hunting spot, for,

34:04.786 --> 34:06.988
deer, or maybe bear.

34:07.021 --> 34:08.022
A lot of bear in this area?

34:08.056 --> 34:09.456
Yeah, but you don't have to
worry about that.

34:09.489 --> 34:11.592
This place is covered in bear
traps,

34:11.626 --> 34:13.695
and those will really fuck you
up.

34:13.728 --> 34:15.297
Bear traps?

34:15.328 --> 34:21.234
Yeah, put down in the thirties
by the Dogrib.

34:22.402 --> 34:24.705
These stones were put down
maybe, five,

34:24.737 --> 34:26.706
six hundred years ago.

34:26.739 --> 34:28.440
You see, the natives, they kept
a close eye on this spot

34:28.475 --> 34:32.078
for a few thousand years,
along with some other

34:32.110 --> 34:36.081
spots, that we haven't
started to excavate yet.

34:36.114 --> 34:38.318
No markings... Nothing?

34:38.351 --> 34:42.121
Just boring old stones.

34:42.155 --> 34:46.324
Your specialty's Clovis.

34:46.358 --> 34:50.462
Yeah, since grad school.

34:50.495 --> 34:54.699
Graduation year? '02.

34:54.733 --> 34:59.037
You ever seen
anything like this?

34:59.071 --> 35:03.342
I've never even heard
about anything like this.

35:03.375 --> 35:04.075
Yeah.

35:07.745 --> 35:10.347
You don't think we're,
we're trying to pull some sort

35:10.381 --> 35:12.683
of elaborate hoax, do you?

35:12.716 --> 35:14.117
Nah.

35:14.151 --> 35:16.620
The radio-carbon dating
you had done on the

35:16.653 --> 35:19.623
structure places it near
the end of the ice age.

35:19.657 --> 35:20.591
Yep.

35:20.624 --> 35:22.359
And it's a solid structure?

35:22.392 --> 35:23.460
Right.

35:23.494 --> 35:26.197
People didn't stay in one place
during the ice age.

35:26.228 --> 35:28.464
Carbon dating of the artifacts
suggests that

35:28.499 --> 35:31.601
these people were here for a
span of a few hundred years.

35:31.634 --> 35:33.402
That's what doesn't make sense.

35:33.435 --> 35:36.705
Maybe they found ways to adapt
to the cold.

35:36.739 --> 35:38.108
Then why did they leave?

35:38.140 --> 35:39.209
Where did they go?

35:39.240 --> 35:42.210
South, to form early
Mesoamerica.

35:42.243 --> 35:47.451
If they were going south, they
would have gone south.

36:19.379 --> 36:24.151
For Christ sakes, would you cut
it out?

36:24.183 --> 36:25.319
I'm bored.

36:25.352 --> 36:28.754
Go to work. You're still on the
clock.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.723
What clock? There's nothing to
do.

36:30.756 --> 36:32.825
Why don't you try fixing that
radio?

36:32.858 --> 36:35.628
You are the equipment
technician, aren't you?

36:35.661 --> 36:39.499
That fucking radio is fine.
Everything on it works.

36:39.532 --> 36:41.901
Except the part that lets us
talk to other people.

36:41.934 --> 36:44.604
It's the ranger's station's
radio that's fucked, alright?

36:44.637 --> 36:46.405
Nothing I can do here can fix
that.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.307
Well if you aren't going to go
to work,

36:48.339 --> 36:53.847
knock it off with that God
damned ball!

37:19.604 --> 37:21.905
We're out of cream.
That's fine.

37:21.938 --> 37:23.940
Look at this.

37:23.974 --> 37:25.342
You see here?

37:25.375 --> 37:30.179
That looks like a simplified version
of something you'd see on a.

37:30.213 --> 37:32.247
Mayan or Aztec wall.

37:32.281 --> 37:33.750
Really simplified.

37:33.784 --> 37:35.186
Right.

37:35.218 --> 37:36.920
What's strange is that, all of
these symbols

37:36.953 --> 37:41.524
mean nothing in any Mesoamerican
system of writing.

37:41.556 --> 37:46.260
Aesthetically, they look Mesoamerican,
but there's nothing here to suggest

37:46.294 --> 37:48.297
that that is what this is.

37:48.329 --> 37:50.666
I think that the similar
aestheric is

37:50.699 --> 37:52.669
likely just coincidence.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.336
So, what does it stem from?

37:54.370 --> 37:56.505
Well, it doesn't look like
anything from South America,

37:56.537 --> 37:58.306
so it's out of my expertise.

37:58.341 --> 38:02.544
I do believe, however, that
what we're looking at is not a

38:02.577 --> 38:06.582
writing system, but a
systematic series of drawings.

38:06.614 --> 38:10.518
A lot of them are animals.
Maybe a hunting ritual?

38:10.552 --> 38:13.987
Cave wall kind of stuff, but just
with more of a coherent style.

38:14.020 --> 38:17.225
So, maybe a culture that was
here before the ice age.

38:17.257 --> 38:19.960
They built the structure
to survive in the cold,

38:19.992 --> 38:23.230
but they didn't make it
to the end of the ice age

38:23.263 --> 38:28.734
because of the cold.

39:40.603 --> 39:43.571
McNaughton, you in there?

39:44.939 --> 39:47.475
McNaughton?

39:47.508 --> 39:52.480
I'm coming in, okay?

39:57.518 --> 39:59.587
Hey.

39:59.619 --> 40:04.458
Why didn't you answer the door?

40:04.492 --> 40:06.528
Sorry...

40:06.561 --> 40:08.363
I was just...

40:08.396 --> 40:10.765
Reading.

40:10.798 --> 40:13.334
Right.

40:13.367 --> 40:20.873
We saved you some lunch. You missed
breakfast, too. Are you okay?

40:20.906 --> 40:22.074
I'm fine.

40:22.107 --> 40:26.979
You... Need me to get you
anything? Something to drink?

40:27.012 --> 40:29.350
I'm fine.

40:29.381 --> 40:32.485
Okay.

40:32.518 --> 40:35.454
Your lunch is in the kitchen.

40:48.601 --> 40:51.969
<i>-Jensen, come in. Jensen.
-Yeah.</i>

40:52.003 --> 40:55.140
<i>Meet me at my office,
I heard screaming.</i>

40:55.172 --> 40:56.365
<i>-I think it's Welles.
-What?</i>

40:56.366 --> 40:57.708
<i>Alright, yeah.
I'll be right there.</i>

40:57.741 --> 41:01.513
<i>What? Alright, yeah.
I'll be right there.</i>

41:11.622 --> 41:13.658
What's going on?

41:13.689 --> 41:14.992
Doc heard screaming.

41:15.024 --> 41:18.561
He went to go check on Welles.

41:18.595 --> 41:20.464
And? Is he alright?

41:20.497 --> 41:24.969
I don't no, it's fucked up.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.772
Help me find it! Just look!

41:28.804 --> 41:29.973
It's okay, Welles, it's okay.

41:30.005 --> 41:33.143
Help me hold him down! What the
fuck are you waiting for?

41:33.176 --> 41:36.545
Jesus! It's right here!

41:36.578 --> 41:39.981
-What the hell!?
-Hold him down!

41:40.016 --> 41:44.721
It's moving up his God damned arm!
What the fuck are you waiting for!?

41:44.752 --> 41:46.455
Hold him down! Hold him down!
Shit.

41:46.488 --> 41:47.856
Holy fuck!

41:47.888 --> 41:50.825
-What do you... What do you want me to do?!
-Do something!

41:50.859 --> 41:52.828
-The fuck is that!?
-Cut it off!

41:52.861 --> 41:54.654
-Cut it off!
-Yeah.

41:54.655 --> 41:57.164
The fuck is going on here!?

41:57.198 --> 41:57.681
No! No!

41:57.682 --> 41:59.133
-Hold him down!
-No!

41:59.166 --> 42:01.502
-Giles, hold him down!
-Take it easy, kid.

42:01.534 --> 42:03.504
-Hold him. Hold him!
-Easy kid.

42:03.536 --> 42:05.739
Olsen! Olsen what
the fuck are you...

42:05.774 --> 42:09.143
Clear!

42:09.176 --> 42:13.681
-What the fuck is that, man!?
-Okay, deep breaths.

42:13.713 --> 42:15.583
Deep breaths.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.716
-Hold on, kid. Hold on.
-What are you doing?

42:17.749 --> 42:21.555
-Get the fucking morphine.
-Deep breaths.

42:21.587 --> 42:24.223
Hang on kid. Almost there.

42:24.257 --> 42:26.125
Almost there.

42:26.158 --> 42:30.763
Almost there. Almost there.

42:33.699 --> 42:38.538
Fuck!

42:42.874 --> 42:43.576
Fuck.

43:53.874 --> 43:56.812
Anyone ever been sick like this
before?

43:56.843 --> 43:59.713
Yeah, all the time. I'm serious.

43:59.747 --> 44:01.181
You puttin' this in your report?

44:01.215 --> 44:03.017
I'm putting everything in the
report.

44:03.050 --> 44:04.919
Woah. This has nothing to do
with the site.

44:04.952 --> 44:08.555
The report's not just about the
site. It's about the entire camp.

44:08.590 --> 44:10.091
Look. Professor.

44:10.123 --> 44:11.958
We brought you up here to check on
that structure, and get us more money.

44:11.992 --> 44:14.094
You want more money, you have
to address the issues.

44:14.127 --> 44:16.063
Issues? What issues? The guy's sick. It
has nothing to do with the operation.

44:16.096 --> 44:18.964
You weren't properly equipped
to deal with the situation.

44:18.998 --> 44:20.833
That's bull shit.

44:20.866 --> 44:22.869
We cauterized his arm with a
fucking shovel.

44:22.902 --> 44:25.572
Yeah, well we weren't exactly
anticipating a God damned amputation.

44:25.605 --> 44:27.206
You're ill-equipped.
You know what, fine.

44:27.240 --> 44:32.812
Do your report. Maybe we can use the grant
money to buy a fucking Cat-Scan machine.

45:08.111 --> 45:13.584
Francis...

45:30.266 --> 45:33.769
Do you see it?

47:18.401 --> 47:21.739
Woah. Jesus fucking Christ.

47:21.770 --> 47:23.872
What... Jesus Christ.

47:23.907 --> 47:25.273
McNaughton...

47:28.143 --> 47:30.946
Anyone, come in, come in,
anyone!

47:30.981 --> 47:32.849
-Is anyone there?
-Is anyone there?

47:32.883 --> 47:33.916
-Is anyone there?
-Is anyone there?

47:33.949 --> 47:36.152
-McNaughton's lost it!
-McNaughton's lost it!

47:36.185 --> 47:40.790
Come in, we're in the lodging cabin,
he cut off his fucking hand, get Doc!

47:40.822 --> 47:42.891
He cut off his fucking hand,
get Doc!

47:42.923 --> 47:47.062
I'm on my way, over. Okay, bud. Just
calm down. What's up? What's happening?

47:47.095 --> 47:51.366
It's going to be okay, Doc's on his
way, okay? Just relax, McNaughton.

47:51.399 --> 47:55.804
Dude,
what the fuck is...

47:55.835 --> 47:59.906
Grab him! Hold him down. Holy
shit!

47:59.941 --> 48:02.444
Hold him down! What happened?
He cut his arm off!

48:02.477 --> 48:04.278
What's wrong with him?!

48:04.311 --> 48:06.847
Help me hold him still.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.883
Hold him still.

48:10.983 --> 48:12.819
Tie it up!

48:12.853 --> 48:17.525
Hurry!

48:17.558 --> 48:21.295
C'mon, hold on, McNaughton.

48:31.571 --> 48:37.142
It's probably safe to assume you've
never heard of anything like this.

48:40.445 --> 48:41.947
Is he gonna make it?

48:41.980 --> 48:44.983
I don't want to sound
pessimistic, but I doubt it.

48:45.016 --> 48:48.220
Not as long as he stays here.

48:48.254 --> 48:49.321
And McNaughton?

48:49.352 --> 48:53.291
I've got him on an
anti-psychotic.

48:53.323 --> 48:54.859
Did it work?

48:54.892 --> 48:58.864
We'll see. I'll keep a close eye on him
until we can get him out of here, but...

48:58.895 --> 49:00.965
He's probably going to lose the
rest of that arm.

49:00.998 --> 49:05.036
He made a real gnarly mess out
of it.

49:05.069 --> 49:05.570
Christ.

50:14.035 --> 50:15.136
Good.

50:21.707 --> 50:22.409
This way.

50:32.251 --> 50:35.622
Follow my voice.

50:40.191 --> 50:43.962
Open your eyes.

50:47.065 --> 50:49.268
Good.

50:49.301 --> 50:53.238
I can see you, Jensen.

51:13.689 --> 51:15.992
Any symptoms? Feeling sick?

51:16.025 --> 51:16.859
Dizziness, headaches?

51:16.894 --> 51:21.365
No, no, I feel fine, I'm
just... Tired.

51:21.396 --> 51:23.433
Have you been sleeping?

51:23.465 --> 51:25.601
Yeah, some. I,

51:25.634 --> 51:29.106
I wake up and then I can't get
back to sleep.

51:29.137 --> 51:31.273
How long's that been going on
for?

51:31.307 --> 51:34.277
A few weeks.

51:34.309 --> 51:37.112
It's probably stress.

51:37.146 --> 51:41.483
You, have any heart palpitations?
Shortness of breath?

51:41.516 --> 51:43.084
No.

51:43.119 --> 51:45.387
Just waking up for no reason?

51:45.419 --> 51:49.190
Yeah, pretty much.

51:49.223 --> 51:53.627
I have been... Having this,
dream,

51:53.659 --> 51:54.362
though.

52:00.501 --> 52:01.670
Well,

52:01.702 --> 52:05.473
sometimes when you dream. The
body releases adrenaline.

52:05.505 --> 52:07.141
Wakes you up. Is it a nightmare?

52:07.175 --> 52:12.412
No, it's not a nightmare, I mean, it's not
like I'm afraid, or anything like that.

52:17.083 --> 52:19.185
What's the dream?

52:24.290 --> 52:27.494
I see this... Person.

52:27.527 --> 52:30.362
These people, I guess.

52:30.394 --> 52:34.633
They're like us, but
they're not.

52:34.666 --> 52:38.137
It's very strange...

52:38.169 --> 52:44.443
I just feel like they're
watching me.

52:44.476 --> 52:46.044
I don't know.

52:46.076 --> 52:50.815
Alright, well. I'll get you some sleeping
pills. They'll help reduce REM sleep.

52:50.848 --> 52:55.652
You got any allergies? Heart
condition?

52:55.686 --> 52:56.389
Okay.

53:02.726 --> 53:05.663
All the artifacts were found within
thirty feet of the structure.

53:05.696 --> 53:08.731
They all have animals on
them being portrayed as

53:08.766 --> 53:12.170
god-like creatures. That
much is fairly evident.

53:12.202 --> 53:13.704
Right.

53:13.736 --> 53:15.238
Based on the sheer amount of effort that
went into making all these artifacts,

53:15.271 --> 53:19.342
and the structure, and the consistent
use of animal imagery on all of it,

53:19.374 --> 53:22.778
there's no question that this site
was extremely important to them.

53:22.812 --> 53:24.713
Probably a place of worship.
Right, like a shrine.

53:24.747 --> 53:28.584
Right. Now, one recurring theme in
a lot of these pieces is the deer.

53:28.616 --> 53:30.118
This deer god is very important
to them.

53:30.153 --> 53:37.126
Maybe a creator god, like a Kukulkan in
Mayan, or Ehecatl in Aztec religion.

53:37.159 --> 53:38.594
You alright?

53:38.626 --> 53:39.829
Yeah, just thinking...

53:39.862 --> 53:44.433
Yeah, as for where they went
to... Look here.

53:44.465 --> 53:48.269
A lot of early tribes and civilizations
were wiped out by disease.

53:48.302 --> 53:52.573
Obviously, they had no medicine back
then, and they had no understanding

53:52.607 --> 53:56.177
of the concept of
germs and bacteria.

53:56.209 --> 53:59.580
Now, this piece. This is our
youngest piece by...

53:59.613 --> 54:02.382
about a hundred years, so far.

54:02.415 --> 54:03.849
Now, if you look here,

54:03.883 --> 54:08.221
these resemble people but, what's
strange is that they're disfigured.

54:08.255 --> 54:11.892
In all the other pieces, their portrayal
of people is fairly accurate.

54:11.925 --> 54:14.894
Standing up... Arms, legs,
heads...

54:14.927 --> 54:17.297
But that's not the case in this
piece.

54:17.329 --> 54:20.500
People are missing appendages.
They're slouched over.

54:20.533 --> 54:23.769
I believe this
depicts an illness...

54:23.801 --> 54:24.971
A plague.

54:25.002 --> 54:29.508
As the ice melted, the bacteria
could have been unfrozen.

54:29.543 --> 54:35.248
I mean, the time line of our pieces
ends near the end of the ice age.

54:35.281 --> 54:37.415
It's just a theory.

54:37.448 --> 54:39.783
So it wasn't the cold that
killed them,

54:39.816 --> 54:42.220
it was the cold
protecting them, in a way.

54:42.254 --> 54:43.922
Exactly.

54:43.954 --> 54:44.989
So everyone dies,

54:45.024 --> 54:48.593
then no one comes through
for thousands of years,

54:48.626 --> 54:52.531
letting the thing get buried
beneath sediment and ice.

54:53.398 --> 54:57.802
Interesting. Well, it's interesting,
but it's not what I'm worried about.

54:57.834 --> 55:01.371
What are you worried about?
I'm worried about Welles.

55:01.405 --> 55:06.277
Welles. You think what he has is
what this artifact is showing?

55:06.310 --> 55:09.612
It's happened before.
The Curse of the Pharaohs.

55:09.645 --> 55:12.948
So, we're looking at a bacteria that's
ten to eleven thousand years old.

55:12.982 --> 55:19.523
Yeah, frozen, deep in the ice along with
that structure and these artifacts.

55:43.777 --> 55:47.348
Someone was sneaking around
the outpost last night.

55:47.382 --> 55:48.550
Who?

55:48.583 --> 55:49.918
You tell me.

55:49.951 --> 55:51.253
I don't no, maybe it was an animal.

55:51.285 --> 55:53.621
For Christ sake, that was no
animal.

55:53.654 --> 55:55.823
It was speaking words, I heard
it outside my room!

55:55.856 --> 55:58.859
Look! I'm hearing things, we're
all hearing things. Okay?

55:58.892 --> 55:59.960
But there's no one out there.

55:59.992 --> 56:02.596
We're in the middle of nowhere.
This is just stress.

56:02.629 --> 56:04.265
It's not stress!

56:04.298 --> 56:06.506
There was someone
outside my fucking window,

56:06.507 --> 56:08.467
speaking fucking
words to someone else!

56:08.501 --> 56:10.169
What are you suggesting?
It's one of the crew?

56:10.204 --> 56:12.639
I'm suggesting,
someone in our crew is

56:12.640 --> 56:15.575
sneaking around, snatching
up all our supplies

56:15.607 --> 56:18.711
and is going to leave us with
nothing, and then we're fucked!

56:18.744 --> 56:19.846
-That's insane.
-Is it?

56:19.878 --> 56:21.146
-Yes.
-Is it insane?

56:21.147 --> 56:21.781
Yes!

56:21.813 --> 56:23.916
Is McNaughton slicing up his
arm insane?

56:23.948 --> 56:27.619
Is all our workers waking up
one day and deciding to walk

56:27.654 --> 56:30.556
one hundred miles in the arctic
winter insane?

56:30.590 --> 56:33.360
Just look into it!

57:00.650 --> 57:03.586
<i>Look.</i>

57:03.621 --> 57:07.925
<i>As hard as you can.</i>

57:10.459 --> 57:13.296
<i>Don't look at the trees,</i>

57:13.330 --> 57:15.966
<i>or the mountains...</i>

57:15.999 --> 57:17.801
<i>Look past them.</i>

57:29.478 --> 57:29.979
<i>Look.</i>

57:54.000 --> 57:58.706
I just found him
here like this...

58:04.611 --> 58:08.915
He must have untied himself
and taken my rifle.

58:10.816 --> 58:14.486
Well, that's just wonderful.

58:14.521 --> 58:17.624
Did he have a family?

58:17.656 --> 58:19.759
Ex-wife and a kid.

58:19.793 --> 58:21.527
Yeah, divorced though.

58:21.560 --> 58:23.029
Still...

58:25.931 --> 58:27.433
Do an autopsy.

58:27.465 --> 58:31.371
See if you can find out what
was wrong with him.

58:39.443 --> 58:44.882
Any word on a rescue?

58:44.916 --> 58:47.686
Not yet...

59:03.933 --> 59:06.569
Wash your hands.

59:06.602 --> 59:12.075
I think I'll take a shower.

59:16.012 --> 59:20.649
Are you gonna watch me cut him
open?

59:20.682 --> 59:22.851
No, thanks.

59:22.884 --> 59:23.587
Fuck...

59:45.738 --> 59:49.509
I ran some tests on the tumors
that were forming under his skin.

59:49.542 --> 59:51.746
The cells aren't human.

59:51.779 --> 59:52.848
What are they?

59:52.879 --> 59:58.919
They bare similarity to the
cells of a cephalopod.

59:58.953 --> 01:00:00.555
An octopus.

01:00:00.587 --> 01:00:03.524
There were traces of human cells, but they
were weird in the sense that they were

01:00:03.557 --> 01:00:05.691
in the process of changing...

01:00:05.725 --> 01:00:06.827
Into what?

01:00:06.861 --> 01:00:08.260
Into the octopus like cells...
Or squid or whatever.

01:00:08.293 --> 01:00:12.998
You're trying to tell us that Welles
was turning into an octopus...

01:00:13.032 --> 01:00:14.968
Well, sort of.

01:00:15.001 --> 01:00:16.469
The cell formations that were building
on his muscle tissue, they would...

01:00:16.503 --> 01:00:21.240
detach once they reached a certain
size. I ran some blood tests earlier,

01:00:21.272 --> 01:00:25.110
and the invader cells were
present in his blood stream.

01:00:25.143 --> 01:00:27.614
And more than likely in his
spine, too.

01:00:27.645 --> 01:00:29.747
Welles is turning into an
octopus...

01:00:29.781 --> 01:00:31.650
More like, thousands of tiny
little ones.

01:00:31.684 --> 01:00:34.652
What the fuck does that mean? It means
that he's really God damned sick.

01:00:34.685 --> 01:00:37.522
Okay? I can't dumb it down for
you more than that.

01:00:37.555 --> 01:00:38.824
Jesus.

01:00:38.856 --> 01:00:40.158
Yeah.

01:00:40.192 --> 01:00:41.526
It's not possible.

01:00:41.559 --> 01:00:42.560
Really?

01:00:42.593 --> 01:00:44.828
-Tell me more, professor.
-Guys!

01:00:44.863 --> 01:00:46.997
Guys!

01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:49.766
What are we gonna do?

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.870
Well, I've got him on
every antibiotic I have.

01:00:51.903 --> 01:00:55.106
Hopefully, it can stop
the invader cells...

01:00:55.138 --> 01:00:55.907
Otherwise...

01:00:55.938 --> 01:00:58.976
We have to get a fucking
aquarium.

01:00:59.009 --> 01:01:02.679
What about McNaughton?

01:01:02.712 --> 01:01:06.016
I found the same bacteria in
McNaughton's blood stream and his spine.

01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:09.753
Which leads me to believe that
this bacteria, it spreads like

01:01:09.786 --> 01:01:13.924
tertiary syphilis. Okay? It starts
in the spine; It moves to the bones,

01:01:13.957 --> 01:01:16.726
the muscle tissue, the skin
and then eventually,

01:01:16.759 --> 01:01:18.860
as in this case, the brain.

01:01:18.894 --> 01:01:21.130
So, the bacteria drove him
insane?

01:01:21.162 --> 01:01:23.565
Well, it's a bit of a stretch
to make that kind of diagnosis,

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.235
based on the fact that I've never
seen anything like this before.

01:01:26.267 --> 01:01:30.772
I mean, he could have had a mental
breakdown due to isolation sickness, or

01:01:30.805 --> 01:01:34.576
a schizophrenic episode brought
on by stress, or the bacteria.

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:38.881
I mean, he was exhibiting signs of
schizophrenia. Sudden temper, depression...

01:01:38.914 --> 01:01:44.585
But I'd have to see his family's medical
history, and I can't access that from here.

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:45.986
All right, so what do we do?

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:49.090
We need to get Welles to a
hospital or he will die.

01:01:49.123 --> 01:01:51.225
I can keep him pumped up with,
antibiotics.

01:01:51.259 --> 01:01:57.731
But, hopefully he can fight off
the side effects.

01:01:57.764 --> 01:02:00.568
Is it... Contagious?

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.736
Probably.

01:02:01.769 --> 01:02:04.604
First thing tomorrow, I want
that structure re-buried,

01:02:04.637 --> 01:02:08.175
I want the artifacts quarantined,
I want the whole site sterilized.

01:02:08.207 --> 01:02:09.343
What?

01:02:09.376 --> 01:02:11.610
You can't re-open this site
until you've quarantined,

01:02:11.644 --> 01:02:14.347
tested, and surveyed all
the wildlife in the area.

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:15.782
That'll take years.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:18.718
You're already responsible for the
death of one, maybe two crew members.

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:21.286
You started excavating before
the site was deemed safe,

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.055
and now you're dealing
with the consequences.

01:02:23.088 --> 01:02:24.662
-To re-bury the site...
-We are dealing a

01:02:24.663 --> 01:02:27.025
dangerous bacteria that
we know nothing about.

01:02:27.058 --> 01:02:29.794
What I saw come out of Welles's
arm...

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:31.798
I won't have you, or anyone
else subjected to.

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:33.832
I'm not going to throw away
three years of work! Look, he's

01:02:33.865 --> 01:02:36.068
right, okay? This is foreign to
anything I've ever seen before.

01:02:36.101 --> 01:02:40.004
We don't know what it can do.
We shouldn't fuck with it.

01:02:40.037 --> 01:02:45.977
This is fucking bull shit.

01:03:11.135 --> 01:03:14.338
<i>Francis...</i>

01:03:19.207 --> 01:03:22.612
<i>Come here...</i>

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:16.027
<i>Did you see it?</i>

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:18.964
I saw you.

01:04:18.996 --> 01:04:23.201
<i>What else did you see?</i>

01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:27.038
Nothing.

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:29.141
There was nothing there.

01:04:29.174 --> 01:04:32.410
<i>They're talking about you.</i>

01:04:32.444 --> 01:04:35.280
Who?

01:04:35.313 --> 01:04:37.917
<i>The others.</i>

01:04:37.949 --> 01:04:39.983
Why?

01:04:40.018 --> 01:04:46.191
<i>They think you're going mad.</i>

01:04:46.224 --> 01:04:47.392
Am I?

01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:51.997
<i>They think you've got it.</i>

01:04:54.965 --> 01:04:55.466
Do I?

01:05:03.373 --> 01:05:08.278
<i>That's right...</i>

01:05:08.311 --> 01:05:12.315
<i>Good.</i>

01:05:35.103 --> 01:05:38.405
Hey. You're up late.

01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:43.377
First thing tomorrow, we're going
to quarantine these artifacts,

01:05:43.411 --> 01:05:48.517
start a report so we can get the ball
rolling on re-opening this site.

01:05:50.850 --> 01:05:53.486
Okay.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.922
You okay?

01:05:55.955 --> 01:05:58.191
Yeah.

01:05:58.225 --> 01:06:00.361
I mean, I've seen some
shit before, but...

01:06:00.393 --> 01:06:01.895
Nothing like that...

01:06:01.928 --> 01:06:05.799
This thing goes sour, I'm the one that
has to explain it to his parents.

01:06:13.306 --> 01:06:17.543
<i>Kill him.</i>

01:06:18.978 --> 01:06:21.814
If a rescue doesn't come
in the next few days, I

01:06:21.846 --> 01:06:24.917
think a few of us should
go hike up to the reserve.

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:28.554
<i>-Do it.
-Sure.</i>

01:06:28.587 --> 01:06:30.156
<i>Kill him.</i>

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:34.325
Weather's going to break
in the next few days.

01:06:34.359 --> 01:06:39.064
I think it might be smart to
take advantage of that

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:42.999
while we can.

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:43.535
Okay.

01:06:48.006 --> 01:06:52.476
You need anything?

01:06:52.508 --> 01:06:55.246
No.

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:55.978
You sure?

01:07:00.949 --> 01:07:02.519
Yeah.

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:06.823
Alright.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:27.721
Stop!

01:09:28.721 --> 01:09:36.131
I... Just stop!

01:09:36.162 --> 01:09:38.031
Why?

01:09:38.064 --> 01:09:39.332
He was in pain.

01:09:39.367 --> 01:09:41.403
I put him out of his pain.

01:09:41.434 --> 01:09:42.670
He was in pain.

01:09:42.702 --> 01:09:45.406
His face, I've never
seen anything like it.

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:49.176
-It was horrible.
-Just step back.

01:09:49.207 --> 01:09:54.714
All the way to the wall.

01:09:54.747 --> 01:09:58.685
Step back! Just
stay the fuck back.

01:09:58.719 --> 01:10:02.556
What did you do?
What the fuck did you do?

01:10:02.588 --> 01:10:04.456
He was in pain. He couldn't die.

01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:08.394
He wanted me to kill him. I didn't
want to. But he wanted me to...

01:10:08.428 --> 01:10:12.665
He made me do it. He made me do
it. So I cut his wrist,

01:10:12.696 --> 01:10:16.102
but he didn't die, so I... I cut
his throat, but he kept screaming

01:10:16.134 --> 01:10:18.303
so I thought if I take off his
head, and I kept hitting him...

01:10:18.336 --> 01:10:21.539
-Step back! He didn't die, man!
-He didn't die!

01:10:21.572 --> 01:10:23.108
-And I didn't know what to do!
-Stop!

01:10:23.141 --> 01:10:25.344
I kept trying and I tried to
stop his heart

01:10:25.378 --> 01:10:29.447
but it didn't stop. It didn't
stop! And it was horrible!

01:10:29.481 --> 01:10:33.151
I didn't know, it was why...
It was so horrible.

01:10:33.185 --> 01:10:34.386
It was...

01:10:34.419 --> 01:10:37.821
It was... He made me
do it. I swear to God.

01:10:37.856 --> 01:10:42.161
I swear to God, he made me...
He...

01:10:42.193 --> 01:10:46.329
Jesus...

01:10:46.363 --> 01:10:50.435
What the fuck is going on!?

01:10:50.467 --> 01:10:52.569
I... I didn't... He...

01:10:52.602 --> 01:10:56.605
I want to go home.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.176
I would like to go home.

01:11:07.417 --> 01:11:08.652
No, I told you, I want to go...

01:11:08.685 --> 01:11:12.856
No, don't, no!

01:11:12.888 --> 01:11:13.889
He made me do it.

01:11:13.924 --> 01:11:16.791
Don't try anything, or
I'll fucking shoot you.

01:11:16.826 --> 01:11:18.827
Please.

01:11:18.861 --> 01:11:20.662
I had no choice.

01:11:20.697 --> 01:11:24.533
I'm going to be out in the room,
right here, so don't try anything!

01:11:24.566 --> 01:11:26.734
We'll let you out when the
rescue comes.

01:11:26.767 --> 01:11:30.238
<i>No! Listen to me! I had no
choice!</i>

01:11:30.271 --> 01:11:33.709
<i>Giles! He made me do it!</i>

01:11:33.741 --> 01:11:35.510
<i>Giles!</i>

01:11:35.543 --> 01:11:39.681
<i>Giles! Listen!</i>

01:11:39.714 --> 01:11:43.550
<i>Giles!</i>

01:11:52.259 --> 01:11:56.262
<i>You did a good thing.</i>

01:12:28.327 --> 01:12:31.497
Your blood pressure's good.
Liver checks out,

01:12:31.528 --> 01:12:34.632
kidneys are fine... Thyroid,
it's all fine.

01:12:35.265 --> 01:12:38.736
<i>Hey Doc, come in.</i>

01:12:38.768 --> 01:12:40.004
Go ahead.

01:12:40.037 --> 01:12:41.505
<i>Yeah. Look, I'm down at the
supply shed, I just need a hand.</i>

01:12:41.539 --> 01:12:47.411
<i>I gotta get a bunch of these boxes
inside. Can you, can you come down?</i>

01:12:47.443 --> 01:12:51.381
Copy.

01:12:51.415 --> 01:12:53.918
I'll be right back.

01:13:24.479 --> 01:13:28.417
Who's there?

01:13:28.449 --> 01:13:29.952
Hello?

01:13:38.994 --> 01:13:42.463
Olsen...

01:13:45.832 --> 01:13:46.466
Olsen...

01:13:51.037 --> 01:13:54.407
McNaughton?

01:13:59.579 --> 01:14:04.483
Onchocerca

01:14:04.517 --> 01:14:06.519
volvulus...

01:14:06.551 --> 01:14:12.626
It lays it's maggots,
in human skin,

01:14:12.658 --> 01:14:15.294
which survive in the eyeball.

01:14:15.327 --> 01:14:16.894
Shut up!

01:14:16.929 --> 01:14:18.632
It only lays

01:14:18.664 --> 01:14:22.334
it's eggs in humans.

01:14:22.366 --> 01:14:26.838
Why are you telling me this?

01:14:26.871 --> 01:14:31.475
Five million people a year

01:14:33.977 --> 01:14:37.948
to propagate it's species...
Shut up!

01:14:37.981 --> 01:14:40.517
Such tiny,

01:14:40.551 --> 01:14:43.053
insignificant creatures...

01:14:59.368 --> 01:15:03.538
It was... Speaking to me... I...

01:15:03.573 --> 01:15:06.742
I swear, it was speaking...

01:15:06.775 --> 01:15:11.781
It was saying something about maggots,
and it wouldn't stop, and I...

01:15:11.813 --> 01:15:15.984
I had to stop it. I...

01:15:20.855 --> 01:15:24.793
I stopped it.

01:15:24.827 --> 01:15:28.631
When was the last time you
slept?

01:15:28.662 --> 01:15:32.567
I'm not sure...

01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:40.842
You're hallucinating. No.

01:15:40.874 --> 01:15:44.112
Maybe... I...

01:15:44.144 --> 01:15:48.115
I don't know. It's... It's...

01:15:48.147 --> 01:15:51.785
It seemed real.

01:15:51.817 --> 01:15:54.722
I'm going to give you some sleeping
pills so you can get some rest.

01:15:54.754 --> 01:15:56.589
Lack of sleep, it triggers
hallucinations.

01:15:56.623 --> 01:16:00.727
It seemed so real. I'm going
to give you some Xanax, too.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:06.431
I want you to take these and
get some sleep.

01:16:06.466 --> 01:16:09.435
I'll take care of this...

01:16:25.082 --> 01:16:29.654
It seemed real...

01:16:51.073 --> 01:16:54.044
I brought you some soup.

01:16:59.115 --> 01:17:05.155
We're gonna hike up, to the
reserve tomorrow, if...

01:17:06.556 --> 01:17:08.491
What the hell happened to you?

01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:10.458
Do you not see him?

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:15.431
There's not much of that left,
so you just make it last.

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.432
Please tell me you see him.

01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:19.133
You see him, right?

01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:22.171
I don't. I don't see anything.
What should I see?

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:24.840
He's here. Now.

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:25.973
Listening.

01:17:26.007 --> 01:17:29.977
Watching. He's watching me,
Jensen.

01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:33.449
I can't move without him
watching me. I can't move!

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.715
Just calm down!

01:17:34.749 --> 01:17:40.487
-Okay? It's alright.
-I can't do it anymore. He wants me to...

01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:42.956
He made me do it.

01:17:42.989 --> 01:17:47.862
Okay, just tell me what you see.

01:17:47.894 --> 01:17:50.932
He's behind you.

01:18:02.908 --> 01:18:05.111
What's he doing?

01:18:05.144 --> 01:18:07.181
Watching you.

01:18:10.683 --> 01:18:15.456
Touching you.

01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:19.925
Watching me.

01:18:19.958 --> 01:18:22.227
He's angry with me. He's going
to do something. I don't...

01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.495
Who is he? A deer.

01:18:23.527 --> 01:18:27.030
He's a deer. It's...
I don't know!

01:18:27.064 --> 01:18:29.835
Don't leave me.

01:18:29.867 --> 01:18:32.537
This is all in your head.

01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:35.273
I don't want it anymore.

01:18:35.306 --> 01:18:37.402
I'm going to see if Doc
has something for you, okay?

01:18:37.403 --> 01:18:39.244
No.

01:18:39.276 --> 01:18:43.547
Jensen, please.

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:46.217
Stay. Please. No.

01:18:46.249 --> 01:18:48.885
Jensen!

01:19:00.129 --> 01:19:03.633
Come back!

01:19:03.666 --> 01:19:08.171
Jen, come back!

01:19:45.705 --> 01:19:48.041
Where are you going?

01:19:48.075 --> 01:19:49.742
I think we should
hike up to the rez.

01:19:49.776 --> 01:19:51.912
The weather's gonna be
nice in the next few days.

01:19:51.945 --> 01:19:55.049
Yeah, it looks like you already
thought about that.

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.950
I was going to tell you guys.

01:19:56.982 --> 01:19:58.318
Really?

01:19:58.351 --> 01:20:01.054
Because it looks like you were
about to leave us here.

01:20:01.087 --> 01:20:02.522
I was not going to leave you
guys.

01:20:02.555 --> 01:20:06.159
What? Were you just going to take
the rest of our food with you, too?

01:20:06.192 --> 01:20:08.360
I'm not ditching you guys.

01:20:08.394 --> 01:20:10.997
Just making sure you got the
map and the flashlights?

01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:12.332
You got the batteries there,
too? Hey!

01:20:12.363 --> 01:20:15.100
There's other maps and
there's other flashlights,

01:20:15.133 --> 01:20:17.234
and I'm not fucking
ditching you guys.

01:20:17.268 --> 01:20:19.637
I know your type, Jensen.

01:20:19.672 --> 01:20:21.074
Fucking sociopaths.

01:20:21.105 --> 01:20:24.710
Acting all respectable and altruistic
until your opportunity pops up,

01:20:24.743 --> 01:20:30.115
to get ahead, and bam, there you are,
pushing the rest of us out of the way!

01:20:30.147 --> 01:20:32.116
Well guess what? What?

01:20:32.148 --> 01:20:34.987
If I see you touching
any of our shit,

01:20:35.019 --> 01:20:36.355
I'm going to shoot you.

01:20:36.386 --> 01:20:37.456
And then I'm going to kill you.

01:20:37.487 --> 01:20:41.157
And I won't hesitate, and I
won't have no sympathy.

01:20:41.190 --> 01:20:43.760
Because people like
you got it coming.

01:20:43.794 --> 01:20:46.330
People like you
have it long coming.

01:20:46.362 --> 01:20:50.968
Don't think I don't
have my eyes on you.

01:21:25.466 --> 01:21:27.770
Scared me.

01:21:27.802 --> 01:21:31.938
When was the last time you
slept?

01:21:31.972 --> 01:21:33.940
I don't no.

01:21:33.975 --> 01:21:36.177
Yesterday?

01:21:36.209 --> 01:21:37.944
The day before?

01:21:37.977 --> 01:21:39.279
Okay, I'm taking over.

01:21:39.312 --> 01:21:39.779
Why?

01:21:39.814 --> 01:21:41.849
So you can sleep.

01:21:41.882 --> 01:21:45.318
No, I'm fine.

01:21:45.351 --> 01:21:46.953
Worry about yourself.

01:21:46.986 --> 01:21:49.422
What, you don't trust me?

01:21:49.457 --> 01:21:50.857
Why should I?

01:21:50.890 --> 01:21:52.026
What did I do?

01:21:52.058 --> 01:21:55.429
What did McNaughton do?

01:21:55.461 --> 01:21:57.096
What'd he do?

01:21:57.131 --> 01:21:59.332
You know it's going to be a long winter if
you're gonna spend it up here by yourself

01:21:59.364 --> 01:22:00.733
not trusting anyone.

01:22:00.766 --> 01:22:04.170
Well, if that's what I have to do,
then that's what I have to do.

01:22:08.005 --> 01:22:12.277
I brought you this.

01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:15.014
I don't want it.

01:22:15.046 --> 01:22:18.017
When was the last time you ate?

01:22:18.049 --> 01:22:21.486
I don't no.

01:22:21.519 --> 01:22:23.421
Eat it.

01:22:23.454 --> 01:22:24.655
No.

01:22:24.689 --> 01:22:27.858
I can make my
own food, thank you.

01:22:27.893 --> 01:22:30.128
It's not poison. Leave me alone.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.695
Fucking hell, man.
It's freezing cold.

01:22:31.728 --> 01:22:35.499
You're not going to eat, you're not going
to sleep? You're going to die in here.

01:22:35.532 --> 01:22:36.433
Then let me die!

01:22:36.468 --> 01:22:41.773
Worry about your fucking
selves, I'm fine.

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:16.395
Giles!

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:26.939
Yeah.

01:24:55.964 --> 01:24:58.233
Fuck!

01:24:58.268 --> 01:25:01.972
Mother fucker!

01:25:37.238 --> 01:25:43.578
Jesus fucking Christ...

01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:45.545
He's dead.

01:25:49.649 --> 01:25:53.987
Doc's dead.

01:25:59.492 --> 01:26:01.261
This is bad.

01:26:01.292 --> 01:26:05.130
It's not that bad. No, you're
losing a lot of blood.

01:26:05.163 --> 01:26:07.700
There's probably some
internal bleeding.

01:26:07.733 --> 01:26:09.468
Fuck. Fuck...

01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:12.104
We need a doctor, I don't
know what I'm doing.

01:26:12.136 --> 01:26:13.471
We've got to get to the reserve.

01:26:13.504 --> 01:26:20.446
You can't go anywhere like this.

01:26:20.477 --> 01:26:22.446
You gotta go.

01:26:22.479 --> 01:26:24.716
I'll stay here.

01:26:24.749 --> 01:26:26.418
You'll die.

01:26:26.451 --> 01:26:29.554
I'll be fine.

01:26:29.586 --> 01:26:33.557
There's a... a trail, behind the
site.

01:26:33.589 --> 01:26:38.195
It goes all the way to the reserve.
It's about... Ninety miles.

01:26:38.228 --> 01:26:44.400
If you, hurry, you can get
there in a day and a half, so...

01:26:44.433 --> 01:26:46.069
Okay.

01:26:46.102 --> 01:26:48.104
Sun's coming up in
an hour and a half.

01:26:48.105 --> 01:26:51.107
You'll be down the
mountain in, I don't know...

01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:52.576
Five. And,

01:26:52.609 --> 01:26:57.512
it's going to be a
lot warmer then, so...

01:26:57.546 --> 01:27:01.184
There's a map... in my room.

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:03.451
I'll be sure to send help.

01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:04.186
Okay.

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:34.582
<i>Stop him.</i>

01:27:34.616 --> 01:27:38.052
<i>Stop him.</i>

01:27:38.085 --> 01:27:42.489
<i>Go. Stop him, Jensen.</i>

01:29:14.542 --> 01:29:18.512
Fuck!

01:30:50.565 --> 01:30:52.836
You're not real!

01:30:55.606 --> 01:30:57.941
What do you want from me?

01:30:57.974 --> 01:31:02.311
<i>When an animal looks
up at the night sky,</i>

01:31:02.345 --> 01:31:05.279
<i>what does it see?</i>

01:31:05.314 --> 01:31:10.752
<i>Thousands and thousands
of tiny points.</i>

01:31:10.785 --> 01:31:14.590
<i>Then a man looks up at the same
points</i>

01:31:14.622 --> 01:31:18.726
<i>and sees millions of stars.</i>

01:31:18.759 --> 01:31:21.863
<i>Galaxies, within which</i>

01:31:21.895 --> 01:31:26.433
<i>are billions of planets.</i>

01:31:26.467 --> 01:31:29.536
<i>Do you want to know what I see?</i>

01:31:32.372 --> 01:31:37.544
<i>Were you there,
when I created the stars?</i>

01:31:37.577 --> 01:31:39.512
No.

01:31:39.545 --> 01:31:42.481
<i>Space?</i>

01:31:42.514 --> 01:31:43.983
<i>Time?</i>

01:31:44.017 --> 01:31:44.985
No!

01:31:45.017 --> 01:31:49.655
<i>But still, you think you
deserve understanding.</i>

01:31:49.688 --> 01:31:53.659
I've done nothing to you.
I'm leaving your home.

01:31:53.692 --> 01:31:58.530
<i>You don't really think I'm
bound to that structure,</i>

01:31:58.563 --> 01:31:59.833
<i>do you?</i>

01:32:01.065 --> 01:32:06.437
<i>Artificial carvings on a stone?</i>

01:32:06.471 --> 01:32:11.876
<i>Certainly, you don't believe
that I can be omnipotent,</i>

01:32:11.909 --> 01:32:13.912
<i>omniscient</i>

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:16.382
<i>but not omnipresent.</i>

01:32:16.414 --> 01:32:17.783
You're not God!

01:32:17.815 --> 01:32:22.452
God isn't cruel. He doesn't
kill men like this!

01:32:22.486 --> 01:32:24.422
<i>-No?
-No!</i>

01:32:24.423 --> 01:32:25.958
<i>Do you believe that?</i>

01:32:25.989 --> 01:32:30.494
If you are God, tell me why!

01:32:30.528 --> 01:32:32.429
Tell me!

01:32:32.462 --> 01:32:34.531
<i>I have to go.</i>

01:32:34.564 --> 01:32:37.768
Why don't you stop me?

01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:41.504
Because you're in my fucking
mind, that's why!

01:32:41.537 --> 01:32:43.940
<i>Why don't you think I'm real?</i>

01:32:43.973 --> 01:32:46.576
Because you're a
fucking parasite!

01:32:46.608 --> 01:32:49.979
<i>I'm not here to teach you,</i>

01:32:50.012 --> 01:32:52.514
<i>or to make you believe in me.</i>

01:32:52.549 --> 01:32:54.718
Then shut the fuck up.

01:33:00.589 --> 01:33:03.559
I don't give a shit
what you want,

01:33:03.592 --> 01:33:04.893
where you came from,

01:33:04.927 --> 01:33:07.995
or what you're fucking doing
here.

01:33:12.634 --> 01:33:15.370
You can go fuck yourself,
asshole.

01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:27.514
Where are you!?

01:33:32.452 --> 01:33:35.894
Tell me, God dammit!
