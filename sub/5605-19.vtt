Yeah.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.037
When I have a bad day,
I read it,

17:19.039 --> 17:21.472
and it makes me feel better.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.574
I read it a lot.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.011
Wow.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.413
I already had
beautiful handwriting.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.182
[ Sighs ]

17:31.184 --> 17:32.917
Hey, thanks.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.887
Means a lot
that you kept it.

17:35.889 --> 17:37.522
[ Breathes heavily ]

17:37.524 --> 17:40.224
You know, when I gave you that,
it -- it had eyes.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.527
Oh, yeah.
Uh, Boyd pulled them off.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.529
He -- He went through
a phase where he thought

17:44.531 --> 17:46.164
his animals
were staring at him.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.698
Mm.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.033
He's a weird kid.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.169
Yeah.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.237
You're not gonna get 50 cents
for a blind bear.

17:53.239 --> 17:56.441
Uh...no, but this bear
isn't for sale.

17:56.443 --> 17:59.377
Some parts of the past
are worth holding on to.

17:59.379 --> 18:00.378
Aww.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.113
Yeah.

18:02.115 --> 18:02.947
Just...

18:02.949 --> 18:05.416
Just nothing you wear.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.456
Oh, hey.
He's back.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.957
Before I say anything else,
I'm gonna tell you,

18:12.959 --> 18:14.092
I'm not going
on that trip with you.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.526
What?

18:15.528 --> 18:17.361
If this means you're gonna
sign with Climber's World,

18:17.363 --> 18:18.796
so be it,
but I don't think it's fair

18:18.798 --> 18:19.964
to go on a trip
with you alone

18:19.966 --> 18:20.998
when you're clearly
in love with me.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.303
Male voice: Sweetheart,
who are you talking to?

18:28.541 --> 18:29.941
W-Who's that?

18:29.943 --> 18:32.276
That's Gordon, my fiancé.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.478
Oh.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.113
Gordon, say hi to Mike.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.881
Gordon: Uh, hi, Mike.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.916
H-Hey...

18:38.918 --> 18:40.418
Gordon.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.652
Nice to meet you.

18:41.654 --> 18:45.223
I wish I'd met you
yesterday!

18:45.225 --> 18:46.557
Honey,
I'll call you later.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.092
Love you.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.327
That was to him,
not to you.

18:49.329 --> 18:51.162
Mm-hmm.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.130
So, that's cool.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.664
Fiancé, yeah.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.465
How big is the dude?

18:54.467 --> 18:55.633
Oh...

18:55.635 --> 18:56.567
about average.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.836
Great.
For a Navy S.E.A.L.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.006
I feel like an idiot.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.174
Let's get back
to this itinerary

19:03.176 --> 19:04.308
and just put all this
behind us, okay?

19:04.310 --> 19:07.778
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

19:07.780 --> 19:12.150
Let's roll around in it
for a little while.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.752
You know, I'm really flattered
that you thought

19:14.754 --> 19:16.521
what we had was so special.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.256
Was it really
that good for you?

19:18.258 --> 19:20.525
Well, I just know how hard it is
to get over a guy like me.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.126
[ Laughs ]

19:22.128 --> 19:23.494
How about we start
with Mount Temple?

19:23.496 --> 19:24.929
Mike...

19:24.931 --> 19:27.999
I hope I didn't do anything
to lead you on.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.834
You know,
it's that accent of yours.

19:29.836 --> 19:33.271
Everything you say
sounds like flirting.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.506
Oh, I don't know
about that.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.375
There you go again.
Damn, we're on a hayride!

19:37.377 --> 19:40.678
Look at that!
[ Laughs ]

19:40.680 --> 19:43.447
And you were willing
to bust this whole thing

19:43.449 --> 19:45.816
because you were worried
about my feelings?

19:45.818 --> 19:47.318
Well, just 'cause
we're in the past

19:47.320 --> 19:48.886
doesn't mean
I don't care about you.

19:48.888 --> 19:51.022
Well, that's good to know.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.490
And, also, I didn't want
to have

19:52.492 --> 19:54.025
any bad feelings between us
when I'm hanging on a rope

19:54.027 --> 19:54.992
that you'd be able to cut.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.527
[ Laughs ]

19:58.798 --> 20:01.299
You know, I didn't go with
Climber's World because...

20:01.301 --> 20:03.467
they've forgotten
that the business

20:03.469 --> 20:04.969
is all about the people.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.637
Yeah, we don't forget that
around here.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.239
I can tell.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.575
That's why this kind of place
is where I want to call home.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.710
Great.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.978
And sorry about this.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.213
No hard feelings?

Welcome aboard!
Thanks.

Don't worry, Vanessa.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.401
I'll take it real slow
to keep Mike safe.

Oh, you know,
I think I'll be all right.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.072

to keep up with you.

Yeah, he hurt himself
picking up the paper yesterday.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.710
That's 'cause it was
stuck in a hedge.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.345
That was
a very dangerous hedge.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.747
There are no dangerous hedges
in the mountains.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.382
You know, Eve was
a good rock climber, too.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.416
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, is that right?

20:52.418 --> 20:53.851
Oh, well, yeah.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.119
I spend more time
on my music now.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.454
Well, it shows.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.689
That song that you played us
before dinner was beautiful.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.358
Oh, thank you.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.626
I'm just trying to let her know
how difficult it is

21:01.628 --> 21:02.893
to get in the music business.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.962
Well, some people
pull it off.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.801
And with a voice like Eve's,
I think she's got

21:10.803 --> 21:12.103
a pretty good shot at it.

21:12.105 --> 21:16.073
But what do I know about
the music business?

21:16.075 --> 21:19.076
Vanessa, I loved dinner!

21:19.078 --> 21:20.244
You're beautiful.

21:20.246 --> 21:21.545
You can cook.

Oh, you are so sweet.
Thank you.

Honey, she's not hitting on you.
It's just her accent.
