00:15.166 --> 00:16.548
<i> To find him,</i>

Can it be done?

00:48.315 --> 00:50.816
There are far easier toxins
to weaponize.

00:50.868 --> 00:52.484
No, it must be
this toxin,

00:52.536 --> 00:54.453
and you must work faster.

00:54.505 --> 00:56.839
FAROUK:
<i> Hardwick is a nobody.</i>

01:02.096 --> 01:04.012
Just tell us where Cleopatra is.

01:04.098 --> 01:06.548
Ask Everado Sanchez.
He has her and good riddance!

01:06.634 --> 01:07.549
The narco.

01:07.635 --> 01:08.600
FABI:
I know this man.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.269
He killed my partner!

01:10.337 --> 01:11.270
My partner was

your mother!

ENZO:
<i> They have found Captain Fabi.</i>

01:18.345 --> 01:21.447
Where?
He was shot.
In North America.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.565
Quebec.
Can I see the report?

01:23.651 --> 01:25.684
The death of Captain Fabi
is carabinieri business.

01:25.736 --> 01:26.985
<i> We will take care of it.</i>

01:32.743 --> 01:34.076
I took this off Fabi.

01:34.161 --> 01:36.194
Thought you might want to bring
it back to the Brotherhood.

01:36.247 --> 01:38.464
Thank you.

02:08.412 --> 02:11.747
And "X" marks the spot.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.418
Well, let's go.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.927
I think I should
go alone from here.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.345
No, my
shoulder's fine.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.013
Darling, you got stabbed
by an ice pick.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.632
But more importantly,
my mother was in Serapis,

02:30.718 --> 02:32.801
which might grant me
some leniency for sneaking in.

02:32.887 --> 02:36.688
But I'm just an outsider, huh?

02:36.757 --> 02:37.940
Meet you at
the cafe.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.392
All right, but if you're
not back in half an hour,

02:40.444 --> 02:41.393
I'm coming to get you.

02:41.445 --> 02:42.861
Just...

02:42.930 --> 02:44.530
Be careful.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.148
Hey... it's me.

Huh-- Whoa.
Uh, what, uh--

What are you-- The heck
is happen-- Why...

03:14.929 --> 03:17.229
Danny McNamara.
Where is he?

03:17.297 --> 03:19.898
Uh, he's out of town.
You're...
Mm-hmm.

03:19.967 --> 03:20.983
You're Gwen.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.517
From Interpol,
Danny's friend.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.152
Nope. Not anymore.
Well, look, I know

03:24.238 --> 03:26.405
I'm no lawyer, but you can't
just barge in here

03:26.473 --> 03:28.023
without a warrant,
even in Italy.

03:29.493 --> 03:30.909
Whoa, whoa!
I will read it to you

03:30.978 --> 03:33.144
on the way to the
carabinieri headquarters.

03:33.197 --> 03:35.313
You are being taken in

03:35.366 --> 03:37.366

03:41.755 --> 03:43.205
What-what are you-- Ow!
These are--

03:43.290 --> 03:44.656
You know I'm a priest, right?

03:44.708 --> 03:46.842
I can-- Hey, will you grab
my comfy shoes?

03:46.927 --> 03:48.927
And don't tell me
who wins the game!

03:54.768 --> 03:56.268
It's all right.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.723
I've come with a peace offering.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.725
Fabi's medallion.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.311
Thank you for returning it.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.781
You want Cleopatra.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.617
I want Farouk.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.019
We should be
working together.

04:14.071 --> 04:15.287
You shouldn't have come here.

04:15.355 --> 04:17.789
Fabi told me about my mother.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.124
That she was one of you.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.792
ALESSANDRO:
A promise was made

04:20.861 --> 04:22.411
to never recruit you.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.413
I thought she wanted this
for me.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.747
I understand you have

04:25.833 --> 04:26.865
many questions.

04:26.917 --> 04:29.668
Perhaps one day
I will answer them,

04:29.720 --> 04:31.369
but today is not
that day.

04:31.422 --> 04:33.038
It's time
for you to go.

04:33.090 --> 04:35.874
Is that Fabi?

04:35.926 --> 04:39.177
You are not the only one who has
lost someone they care about.

04:40.547 --> 04:43.649
Fabi taught me
as your mother taught him.

04:48.188 --> 04:50.605
Is...

04:50.691 --> 04:52.858
Is my mother here?

04:58.499 --> 05:02.200
I've been visiting
an empty grave for 20 years.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.621
I'm very sorry.
Both for your loss

05:06.707 --> 05:09.741
and for our deception.

05:09.793 --> 05:11.510
I know it is
no consolation,

05:11.578 --> 05:15.180
but your mother was a warrior
in a much longer struggle.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.768
What did she tell you
of Antony and Cleopatra?

05:19.853 --> 05:23.271
They fell in love,
they went to war, they lost.

05:23.357 --> 05:26.191
They also had three children.

05:26.259 --> 05:31.262
They hid the body
of Antony and Cleopatra,

05:31.315 --> 05:34.116
protecting their
parents' resting place,

05:34.201 --> 05:36.401
so that they could be
together for eternity.

05:36.453 --> 05:38.987
LEXI:
Three children,
three snakes.

05:39.073 --> 05:40.822
And from those three,
the Brotherhood grew,

05:40.908 --> 05:45.327
and evolved, spreading
across the Roman Empire.

05:45.412 --> 05:48.547
We took in people from all
lands and every religion.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.216
Preserving the sacred

05:51.284 --> 05:53.301
At the cost of
people's lives.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.220
It is the Brotherhood

through the Dark Ages,

05:57.808 --> 06:00.008
preserving Christian
and Islamic relics

06:00.094 --> 06:01.226
from the Crusades,

06:01.294 --> 06:03.228
helping give birth
to the Renaissance

06:03.296 --> 06:04.229
and the Enlightenment...

06:04.297 --> 06:06.648
If you were so good
at what you did,

06:06.734 --> 06:08.967
how come the Nazis
took Cleopatra?

06:09.019 --> 06:11.970
The Brotherhood was nearly
destroyed because of the war.

06:12.022 --> 06:13.905
And their numbers
never fully recovered,

06:13.974 --> 06:16.691
but our mission continues.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.745

Although she's a bit rogue
at the moment.

07:47.220 --> 07:48.553
I told her anything
she can say to me,

07:48.638 --> 07:49.721
she can say to you.

07:49.806 --> 07:51.139
How is your shoulder?

07:51.207 --> 07:52.390
Ah, it's been better.

07:52.475 --> 07:54.392
How-how did you know?

07:54.477 --> 07:57.145
We've been monitoring
you two for weeks.

07:57.213 --> 07:59.547
Oh, and FYI, your friend
Chuck has been taken in

07:59.599 --> 08:01.900
by the carabinieri and
Interpol for questioning.

08:01.985 --> 08:04.269
Oh. Oh, my God. We need

Chuck can handle himself.

08:05.888 --> 08:07.488
Gwen doesn't have
anything on him.

08:07.557 --> 08:09.941
Besides, we have more important
matters to attend to.

08:10.026 --> 08:11.225
(exhales)

08:11.278 --> 08:13.244
The Brotherhood had an agent
in the CIA

08:13.330 --> 08:14.913
at the end
of the second Iraq war.

08:14.998 --> 08:16.564
Okay...?

08:16.616 --> 08:19.334
The CIA had a
special task force

08:19.402 --> 08:22.203
training local contractors,
gathering intelligence.

08:22.255 --> 08:24.339
One of those
contractors

08:24.407 --> 08:25.790
barely escaped
a coalition airstrike

08:25.875 --> 08:28.293
that mistook a shelter
for a military bunker.

08:28.378 --> 08:30.962
His entire family
was wiped out.

08:31.047 --> 08:34.048
After that, he
became radicalized.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.133
Karim Farouk.

08:36.252 --> 08:37.602
That is the name

08:37.687 --> 08:39.270

08:41.474 --> 08:43.441
Rasheed Hegazi.

08:44.927 --> 08:47.595
You-- You've known
this information

08:47.647 --> 08:49.981
all this time, why haven't you
done anything with it?

08:50.066 --> 08:52.367
We've been monitoring the name
since we made the connection,

08:52.435 --> 08:54.602
but it hasn't given us anything.

08:54.654 --> 08:57.938
Look, you've been saying all
along we need to work together

08:57.991 --> 08:59.824
to connect
the dots, right?

08:59.909 --> 09:02.961
Well, this is our first new dot
in a long time, so...

09:03.046 --> 09:04.629
let's connect it.

09:04.714 --> 09:06.497
Do you know exactly
when and where

09:06.583 --> 09:08.449
this bombing raid took place?
Yes.

09:08.501 --> 09:10.301
I have a friend
in Iraqi intelligence

09:10.387 --> 09:12.170
who owes me a favor...

09:12.255 --> 09:14.622
but I need to contact him from
someplace it can't be tracked.

09:14.674 --> 09:15.923
Who is your contact?

09:15.976 --> 09:18.593
<i> Wa enta Malak.</i>

09:19.679 --> 09:21.729
That means
"none of your business."

09:21.798 --> 09:23.681
Oh. Does it? (clicks tongue)

09:23.767 --> 09:26.567
That's my bit. (chuckles)

09:26.636 --> 09:29.937
He... he just stole my bit.

09:31.491 --> 09:33.408
DANNY:
<i> My contact sent us the logs</i>

09:33.476 --> 09:36.327
from the investigation
into the bombing.

09:36.413 --> 09:38.946
Looks like there was
one other survivor.

09:40.450 --> 09:43.651
LEXI:
Nadia Bishara.
She was five years old.

09:43.703 --> 09:46.254
"Flown to a U.S. medical unit
for uranium poisoning

09:46.322 --> 09:49.207
from exposure to spent shells,"

09:49.292 --> 09:51.426
but disappeared during
a firefight at the base.

09:51.494 --> 09:54.829
Farouk's entire family
is wiped out,

09:54.881 --> 09:56.848
but this one survivor
from the bombing

09:56.933 --> 09:58.332
just happens to go missing?

09:58.385 --> 10:00.968
You think she's Farouk's
last living relative?

10:01.021 --> 10:03.003
Could be.
Different name.

10:03.056 --> 10:04.505
Easy to miss
the connection.

10:04.557 --> 10:06.891
Especially when Farouk wasn't
on anyone's radar yet.

10:06.976 --> 10:09.560
May I use the computer?

10:13.116 --> 10:17.068
Farouk would have had to take
her to a different hospital.

10:17.153 --> 10:19.019
But for the doctors
to make sure

10:19.072 --> 10:21.355
they had the right
medical records...

10:21.408 --> 10:23.074
She'd need to keep
her real name.

10:23.159 --> 10:25.960
And I can't imagine there's more
than a handful of hospitals

10:26.028 --> 10:27.912
in the region that could
give her the care she needed.

10:27.997 --> 10:30.197
Luckily, medical records are
one of the easiest

10:30.250 --> 10:31.532
databases to hack.

10:31.584 --> 10:33.167
We'll find her.

10:33.219 --> 10:35.136
We find Nadia,

10:35.204 --> 10:37.889
we draw Farouk out
on our terms.

10:37.974 --> 10:40.725
It feels different this time.

10:40.810 --> 10:42.760
We're finally gonna get Farouk.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.050
Where's Danny and Lexi?
I have no idea.

10:48.119 --> 10:50.886
Captain Fabi, my carabinieri
liaison was murdered.

10:50.955 --> 10:52.371
If you know Danny at all,

10:52.457 --> 10:54.123
you know he'd never
murder anybody.

10:54.191 --> 10:56.542
I know Danny's not
a murderer.

10:56.627 --> 10:59.411
I don't know
if I can trust him anymore.

10:59.497 --> 11:01.464
Not since Lexi came back
into his life.

11:01.532 --> 11:02.965
(chuckles)
Yeah.

11:03.033 --> 11:04.633
You're telling me.

11:04.702 --> 11:06.368

11:06.420 --> 11:08.971
Yeah, yeah.
You're right, she is.

11:09.039 --> 11:10.806
No, no, no, no, no.
No, she's not.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.975
She-- She's complicated.

11:13.043 --> 11:15.094
But I think she has
a good heart.

11:15.179 --> 11:17.096
And I know that Danny does.

11:17.181 --> 11:18.814
And I suspect you do, too.

11:18.883 --> 11:23.435
So, what is this
about, really?

11:23.521 --> 11:26.655
Why are you running around
looking for answers,

11:26.724 --> 11:28.824
and the carabinieri isn't?

11:28.893 --> 11:32.912
Fabi was a double agent
of the Brotherhood of Serapis.

11:32.997 --> 11:36.231
And the carabinieri is trying to

11:36.284 --> 11:37.783
sweep the whole thing
under the rug.

11:37.869 --> 11:41.570
That must be tough.
Particularly for you.

11:41.622 --> 11:43.238
Why particularly for me?

11:43.291 --> 11:45.624
Well, you seem like
the type who

11:45.710 --> 11:47.343
keeps your closet
very organized,

11:47.411 --> 11:49.428
and your clothes are all
color-coordinated,

11:49.514 --> 11:52.765
and your socks are all in
perfect little military rolls.

11:52.850 --> 11:54.800
If you ball them up,
you stretch them.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.755
So, the revelation
of secret societies,

11:59.807 --> 12:02.391
and your friend
going around the law--

12:02.443 --> 12:03.776
the law, which, by the way,

12:03.861 --> 12:06.312
is looking the other direction
during this whole thing--

12:06.397 --> 12:09.648
might make you... question
everything you believe

12:09.734 --> 12:11.033
about the world.

12:13.154 --> 12:15.604
I'm fourth-generation police.

12:15.656 --> 12:18.374
I-I was taught
to follow the rules.

12:18.442 --> 12:21.961
Danny and Lexi aren't what's
keeping you up at night.

12:24.048 --> 12:26.966
Uh, just one more thing.

12:28.669 --> 12:29.802
If you're looking
for answers,

12:29.887 --> 12:31.286
why not go right
to the source?

12:31.339 --> 12:34.473
The Italian police have shut me
out of the investigation.

12:34.559 --> 12:37.927
Even though I think Fabi
was getting close to Farouk.

12:37.979 --> 12:40.295
I can't even get access
to his apartment to search it.

12:40.348 --> 12:44.850
Mm. Can't get access...
officially.

12:44.936 --> 12:46.819
You're a priest,
and you're telling me

12:46.904 --> 12:48.153
to-to break the law?

12:48.239 --> 12:51.490
I'm telling you that
there are the laws of God,

12:51.576 --> 12:53.158
which are about
what is just,

12:53.244 --> 12:54.643
and there are
the laws of man,

12:54.695 --> 12:57.312
which are about
what is legal.

12:57.365 --> 12:59.648
Now, the first
you don't break,

12:59.717 --> 13:02.685
but the second...

13:05.656 --> 13:08.841
I found Nadia Bishara.

13:08.926 --> 13:10.175
LEXI:
She's in Moldova?

13:10.261 --> 13:11.493
DANNY:
Porous borders.

13:11.545 --> 13:15.264
Easy for Farouk to get
in and out of unseen.

13:15.332 --> 13:17.349
So, you coming with us?

13:17.435 --> 13:21.003
I think my absence
would be noticed.

13:21.055 --> 13:23.222
In the meantime,
I'll be advocating for you.

13:23.307 --> 13:25.557
I thought you guys
made some promise

13:25.643 --> 13:26.892
not to recruit me.

13:26.978 --> 13:28.777
You walked in on your own.

13:28.846 --> 13:30.362
Now the choice is yours.

13:30.448 --> 13:33.365
Well, I'm not so sure
I want to be a part of

13:33.451 --> 13:35.067
your secret society.

13:35.152 --> 13:37.736
You remind me of myself
before I joined.

13:37.822 --> 13:39.371
You're looking for
a larger purpose.

13:39.457 --> 13:41.356
No, I'm really not.

13:41.409 --> 13:45.711
When the time is right,
I believe you'll know it.

13:50.668 --> 13:52.384
DOCTOR: It's been a while
since he's visited,

13:52.470 --> 13:54.169
but yes, that's
Nadia's uncle.

13:54.221 --> 13:56.972
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but this man is a terrorist

13:57.041 --> 13:58.974
known as Karim Farouk.

14:03.014 --> 14:04.713
I've seen that picture before,

14:04.765 --> 14:06.548
but I never put it together.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.601
He seemed like
such a nice man.

14:09.687 --> 14:13.221
He pays for her care,
showers her with gifts.

14:13.274 --> 14:14.940
Leaves money for the nurses.

14:15.026 --> 14:18.577
What matters is that you now
have the chance to stop him.

14:18.663 --> 14:20.612
And all it takes is
one phone call.

14:20.698 --> 14:22.998
Just tell him
she's taken a bad turn,

14:23.067 --> 14:26.401
and he needs to come
see her immediately.

14:26.454 --> 14:28.403
You want to use Nadia
as bait?

14:28.456 --> 14:31.256
(sighs)
We're asking you to help us

14:31.342 --> 14:33.926
catch a terrorist who has
killed thousands of people.

14:34.011 --> 14:35.511
Women and children.

14:35.579 --> 14:38.213
We can assure you Nadia
won't be harmed.

14:41.135 --> 14:43.469
I understand.

14:43.554 --> 14:46.355
I'll be there.

14:48.142 --> 14:51.193
What's going on?

14:51.261 --> 14:53.612
Get the helicopter ready.
I need to travel.

14:53.698 --> 14:54.613
I'll make security
arrangements.

14:54.699 --> 14:55.814
No, no, not this time.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.483
This is personal.

14:57.568 --> 14:58.767
It's Nadia.

14:58.819 --> 15:00.786
We are this close
to our goal.

15:00.871 --> 15:02.437
You are willing
to risk it all?

15:02.490 --> 15:05.457
What if this is a trap?

15:05.543 --> 15:09.294
Every trap they've laid
for me I have escaped,

15:09.380 --> 15:10.629
and left their bodies behind.

15:10.715 --> 15:13.549
Even if something
does happen to me,

15:13.617 --> 15:16.969
my orders are clear:
finish the job.

15:26.130 --> 15:28.981
I'm starting to regret that
we didn't call Interpol.

15:29.066 --> 15:32.568
Gwen arrested Chuck,
a priest, in<i> Rome.</i>

15:32.636 --> 15:34.153
She's officially gone mental

15:34.238 --> 15:35.738
and is as likely to shoot us
as Farouk.

15:35.806 --> 15:36.939
We can handle this.

15:42.780 --> 15:43.912
DANNY:
That's Farouk's niece.

15:46.867 --> 15:48.150
LEXI:
That's the doctor's cue.

15:48.202 --> 15:49.451
Farouk's on the grounds.

16:12.843 --> 16:14.059
Uncle.

16:14.145 --> 16:15.177
He came alone.

16:15.229 --> 16:16.945
You're here!

16:17.014 --> 16:18.113
FAROUK:
I'm so happy to see you.

16:18.182 --> 16:19.681
NADIA: Me, too.
FAROUK: I brought you...

16:19.733 --> 16:20.983
(Nadia chuckles)

16:22.953 --> 16:24.620
Let's go!

16:28.959 --> 16:31.493
(cries out)
(grunts)

16:36.584 --> 16:38.467
To the left!

16:42.923 --> 16:44.256
(gunshot)

16:44.341 --> 16:46.391
DANNY:
Farouk!

16:47.761 --> 16:48.677
It's over.

16:51.265 --> 16:52.598
(machine gun fire)

16:54.935 --> 16:56.318
(man shouts)

17:00.191 --> 17:01.590
Damn it!

17:01.659 --> 17:03.942
I told you not to follow me.

17:06.247 --> 17:07.362
You can thank me later.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.682
She's upset,
understandably.

17:15.767 --> 17:20.503
As far as she knows,
her uncle is a good man.

17:20.555 --> 17:22.806
And the only family she has.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.060
I have patients to check on.

17:27.145 --> 17:28.194
Please excuse me.

17:30.849 --> 17:33.199
I can't believe
I didn't take the shot.

17:33.285 --> 17:35.035
I had him.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.788
Maybe it's because I didn't
want her to see the only person

17:38.857 --> 17:42.242
she has in the world killed
right there in front of her.

17:42.327 --> 17:44.294
Do you see what
you've done to me?

17:44.362 --> 17:47.213
I'm all soft and weak now.
I'm useless.

17:47.299 --> 17:49.866
Soft isn't weak,
and you're not useless.

17:49.918 --> 17:51.885
We had one shot
to finally get him.

17:51.970 --> 17:53.303
One shot.
Everything worked.

17:53.371 --> 17:55.922
And I let him get away.
It's okay.

17:56.008 --> 17:59.726
An hour ago, Farouk had no idea
we knew his real name.

17:59.811 --> 18:01.878
That he had family left.

18:01.930 --> 18:04.981
He might panic, start
changing his routines.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.599
We have a window
to catch him.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.651
Except we have
no way to find him.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.273
Maybe we do.

18:13.358 --> 18:14.274
He dropped his bag.

18:17.395 --> 18:20.113
(tinkling melody playing)

18:20.198 --> 18:21.748
Okay, yeah, not exactly
something you find

18:21.833 --> 18:23.450
at an airport gift shop.

18:23.535 --> 18:24.918
Look at this.

18:25.003 --> 18:28.404
The Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque in
the city of Famagusta, Cyprus.

18:28.457 --> 18:29.906
That region of Cyprus
has been a haven

18:29.958 --> 18:32.459
for illegal activity
since the ancient Silk Road.

18:32.544 --> 18:33.960
Sounds like a place where
someone might pick up

18:34.046 --> 18:35.962
a special gift for their niece
at the last minute.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.797
We called Farouk
with an emergency,

18:37.883 --> 18:41.084
and he rushed here
from Cyprus.

18:41.136 --> 18:43.436
He's got to head back there
to move his operation.

18:43.522 --> 18:45.588
That's our chance.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.924
We just need to find out
who sold him this music box.

18:47.976 --> 18:49.859
Lucky for us
we happen to know

18:49.928 --> 18:51.828
a shady antiquities trader.

19:01.106 --> 19:03.456
LEXI: Simon.
Hi.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.709
Thanks for meeting us.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.995
Us?

19:11.166 --> 19:12.665
Ah, yes. Of course.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.717
You thought this was
a long-distance booty call?

19:14.786 --> 19:18.955
No. No, of course not...
really.

19:19.007 --> 19:21.057
Just, your message
was rather vague.

19:21.126 --> 19:23.292
We're here about Karim Farouk.

19:23.345 --> 19:25.061
Go on.

19:25.130 --> 19:28.131
We have reason to believe
he's in Famagusta, Cyprus.

19:28.183 --> 19:29.732
LEXI:
We're close, Simon.

19:29.801 --> 19:31.351
This time,
we can stop him for good.

19:31.436 --> 19:34.137
We just need your help
to narrow down where he is.

19:34.189 --> 19:35.989
Look, I know
you're not too excited

19:36.074 --> 19:38.658
about going after
Farouk again...
What, you think?

19:38.743 --> 19:41.077
The man who kept me in
a container for a year

19:41.146 --> 19:43.079
and tortured me at will?
Boys...

19:43.148 --> 19:44.414
We all want a piece of Farouk.

19:44.482 --> 19:46.166
This is our best chance
to stop him.

19:46.251 --> 19:49.819
Look, if I, uh...

19:49.871 --> 19:51.821
if I help you, I want
something in return.

19:51.873 --> 19:54.207
No, you know what? It's not...
Yes.

19:54.292 --> 19:56.993
If I agree to help
you find Farouk,

19:57.045 --> 19:58.761
then I want some legitimacy.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.213
And here I thought
you wanted money.

20:00.298 --> 20:02.098
Well, I want that
as well, obviously.

20:02.167 --> 20:06.186
When Antony and Cleopatra
are presented to the world,

20:06.271 --> 20:09.005
I want to be right there
on the dais with you.

20:09.057 --> 20:11.191
Honestly, I couldn't
care less where you stand,

20:11.276 --> 20:12.942
as long as you help us now.

20:13.011 --> 20:15.895
All right, twist my arm,
why don't you? (clears throat)

20:15.981 --> 20:18.731
In the past, I have had
certain business dealings

20:18.817 --> 20:22.068
with a former band
of Arabian sea pirates.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.737
Actually great guys, you--
when you get to know them.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.689
Family men, really.

20:26.741 --> 20:28.875
They realized that it was
far easier and more profitable

20:28.960 --> 20:31.294
(chuckles):
to smuggle the stolen goods

20:31.362 --> 20:32.412
than to steal them

20:32.497 --> 20:33.830
in-in the first place--

20:33.882 --> 20:35.531
Anyway, their port of call
is Famagusta.

20:35.584 --> 20:37.366
If Farouk's there, then
he's working with them.

20:37.419 --> 20:38.968
What's the name of the ship?

20:39.037 --> 20:40.753
You know, like,
it's a smuggling operation,

20:40.839 --> 20:42.639
so the name changes all the time

20:42.707 --> 20:44.474
so that they can
continue to smuggle.

20:44.542 --> 20:46.309
Okay, tell us how
to find it, then.

20:46.377 --> 20:50.346
Famagusta is to pirates what
the Loire Valley is to wine.

20:51.983 --> 20:53.900
To find the right ship,

20:53.985 --> 20:56.603
you'll need the sommelier
of smugglers.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.238
(laughs)

20:58.323 --> 21:00.389
There's no way
we're bringing you with us.

21:00.442 --> 21:01.724
Fine. Go by yourself.

21:01.776 --> 21:03.826
(clears throat)
You won't get close.

21:03.895 --> 21:06.229
They won't hesitate to shoot
someone that looks out of place,

21:06.281 --> 21:10.233
and you, my clean-cut friend,
are highly suspect.

21:10.285 --> 21:12.252
He's right. You are.
You trust this guy?

21:12.337 --> 21:14.287
Of course not.
You know, it's rude to
talk about somebody

21:14.372 --> 21:16.422
when they're right next to you.
What I do trust

21:16.508 --> 21:18.925
is his hatred for Farouk,
and that he wants him stopped

21:19.010 --> 21:21.344
as much as we do.

21:21.412 --> 21:23.463
Arabian sea pirates?

21:23.548 --> 21:25.748
It doesn't look good
on paper, but...

21:25.800 --> 21:28.084
Yeah, I'm gonna call Gwen.

21:28.136 --> 21:29.886
(laughs)

21:32.307 --> 21:34.224
(phone buzzing)

21:36.027 --> 21:37.360
(sighs)

21:37.428 --> 21:39.862
Danny, this isn't a good time.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.281
Chuck has been
released from custody,

21:41.366 --> 21:43.266
if that's why you're calling.

21:43.318 --> 21:46.069
DANNY:
No, actually, it's about
something more important.

21:46.121 --> 21:47.704
(door opens)

21:47.772 --> 21:50.039
(speaking Italian)

21:50.108 --> 21:51.607
DANNY:
Gwen.

21:51.660 --> 21:53.543
You there?

21:53.611 --> 21:55.545
Uh, Danny,
I can't talk right now.

21:55.613 --> 21:57.797
Okay, we're following
a lead to Cyprus.

21:57.882 --> 21:59.799
