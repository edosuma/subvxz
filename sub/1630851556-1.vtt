00:30.280 --> 00:32.282
<i>You know there's a few things
that we do as astronauts</i>

00:32.490 --> 00:34.159
<i>that really make you feel
like an astronaut...</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:38.872
<i>and spacewalking
is one of those things.</i>

00:40.582 --> 00:45.378
<i>I really just enjoy those days.
I enjoy everything about a spacewalk.</i>

00:46.004 --> 00:49.466
<i>This is the small area
that actually goes to the vacuum</i>

00:49.549 --> 00:54.804
<i>and the hatch that Luca
and I will egress out of is right here.</i>

00:56.765 --> 01:01.019
<i>In space, it's Christmas Day
over and over again</i>

01:01.102 --> 01:05.982
<i>for the kid that's been waiting
for Christmas for 364 days.</i>

01:06.691 --> 01:09.527
<i>We astronauts crave that moment.</i>

01:10.236 --> 01:11.905
<i>Here inside
of the flight control room</i>

01:11.988 --> 01:15.533
<i>at the Johnson Space Center in Houston,
Texas, preparations are continuing</i>

01:15.617 --> 01:19.662
<i>to prepare these two astronauts
for their venture out of station airlocks</i>

01:19.746 --> 01:21.372
<i>into the vacuum of space.</i>

01:21.623 --> 01:25.710
<i>On this spacewalk,
Chris Cassidy will be designated EV1</i>

01:26.169 --> 01:29.631
<i>and then Luca Parmitano
will be designated EV2.</i>

01:32.550 --> 01:33.676
<i>Thanks.</i>

01:37.305 --> 01:39.933
<i>Houston station,
the hatch is closed.</i>

01:40.308 --> 01:42.727
<i>Karen, we copy.
You guys have a good time out there, okay?</i>

01:42.811 --> 01:45.313
<i>Thanks a lot, Karen. Nice work.
Thanks, Karen.</i>

01:49.234 --> 01:51.986
We're ready.
Let's go do a spacewalk.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.075
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

02:20.807 --> 02:23.643
<i>Shane, good morning to everybody
in Houston. Great to be with you.</i>

02:24.060 --> 02:25.353
<i>Good morning, Chris and Luca.</i>

02:26.312 --> 02:29.315
<i>We are ready for you to head out
over to the Z1 site</i>

02:29.482 --> 02:31.818
<i>and we'll get you set up
and ready to go.</i>

02:33.862 --> 02:35.196
<i>Copy that, Shane.</i>

02:39.659 --> 02:40.952
<i>It can be a little frightening,</i>

02:41.035 --> 02:42.579
<i>the first hour
or so when you're out there.</i>

02:42.662 --> 02:44.914
<i>And every now and then,
even when you're experienced,</i>

02:45.915 --> 02:48.126
<i>you stop and take a look.</i>

02:53.464 --> 02:54.841
<i>It's a beautiful sight.</i>

02:56.092 --> 02:58.553
<i>When you see the Earth
out on a spacewalk,</i>

02:58.636 --> 03:03.016
<i>it's usually between your toes
and you're seeing the Earth go by</i>

03:03.266 --> 03:07.937
<i>at five miles a second,
and you know how far it is between cities</i>

03:08.021 --> 03:13.193
<i>and coasts, and you're seeing
that distance happen within minutes.</i>

03:13.818 --> 03:15.445
<i>It really blows your mind.</i>

03:16.321 --> 03:19.490
<i>You have to actually tell yourself,
"Hey, you're here to do a job</i>

03:19.616 --> 03:21.159
<i>"and focus on it."</i>

03:22.660 --> 03:24.954
<i>Getting our first views now
from the helmet cams.</i>

03:25.038 --> 03:28.082
<i>This one, Luca Parmitano,
currently translating over.</i>

03:29.959 --> 03:31.544
<i>It's a very dynamic environment.</i>

03:31.628 --> 03:33.922
<i>Everything changes constantly,
all the time.</i>

03:35.215 --> 03:37.717
<i>You can think about stuff
that will happen,</i>

03:37.800 --> 03:40.178
<i>and then you'll have a procedure,
and then you can follow steps</i>

03:40.261 --> 03:41.429
<i>and make it better.</i>

03:42.972 --> 03:44.390
<i>And then you have those things</i>

03:44.474 --> 03:49.270
<i>that just by human nature
we have never thought about.</i>

03:53.650 --> 03:55.360
<i>All right.
Nice work, Chris.</i>

03:55.902 --> 03:57.654
<i>All right. That's completed, Shane.</i>

03:58.571 --> 04:00.073
<i>Copy, Luca. Nice job.</i>

04:01.115 --> 04:02.533
<i>And just for Chris and Luca,</i>

04:02.617 --> 04:06.663
<i>big picture, you guys are about 15 minutes
ahead of the timeline, looking great.</i>

04:07.121 --> 04:09.040
<i>Thank you.
Copy.</i>

04:11.042 --> 04:12.168
<i>Um...</i>

04:12.961 --> 04:14.879
<i>Yeah, Chris and Shane, FYI.</i>

04:15.421 --> 04:18.049
<i>I feel a lot of water
on the back of my head.</i>

04:18.716 --> 04:21.636
Look, Chris, look.
Just look at me right now.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.350
<i>Oh, I see, yeah.</i>

04:28.893 --> 04:32.897
<i>I see it now. Can you see?
It’s over here, right?</i>

04:33.189 --> 04:35.149
<i>Yeah, I think this is sweat.</i>

04:35.900 --> 04:37.151
<i>No, it’s not sweat.</i>

04:38.403 --> 04:41.114
<i>But where is it coming from then?
It's too much.</i>

04:41.281 --> 04:43.074
<i>I don't know. It's a lot.</i>

04:43.616 --> 04:45.994
<i>Now it's in my eyes.</i>

04:46.995 --> 04:48.621
<i>Shane you back with us?</i>

04:48.705 --> 04:50.748
<i>All right, Chris and Luca.
Just for you guys,</i>

04:50.873 --> 04:52.709
<i>based on what we heard,
what Luca is saying,</i>

04:52.792 --> 04:56.296
<i>that water's in his eyes now
and it seems to be increasing,</i>

04:56.379 --> 04:58.464
<i>we think we're going to terminate.
So, Luca,</i>

04:58.548 --> 05:00.883
<i>-we'll have you head back to the airlock.
Copy.</i>

05:01.509 --> 05:04.554
<i>Hey, Chris. For you, if you can get
that MLM ethernet cable</i>

05:04.637 --> 05:06.848
<i>and put it in the bag,
clean things up here</i>

05:06.931 --> 05:09.517
<i>-and then join him here in a minute.
Okay.</i>

05:09.851 --> 05:11.436
<i>Do you wanna just
head on back to the airlock?</i>

05:11.519 --> 05:13.354
<i>Why don't you just
make your own way back to the airlock</i>

05:13.479 --> 05:14.814
<i>-and I'll clean up this.
Alright.</i>

05:24.240 --> 05:25.867
<i>Sun's about to set, Luca.</i>

05:26.701 --> 05:27.952
<i>Okay.</i>

05:41.924 --> 05:46.596
<i>Now, it's pitch dark
and I remember seeing Luca,</i>

05:46.679 --> 05:50.308
<i>his silhouette disappearing
and I remember thinking to myself,</i>

05:51.017 --> 05:52.894
<i>"This is a really crappy feeling."</i>

05:54.270 --> 05:57.398
<i>Hey, Chris.
I hear you, Luca. Go ahead.</i>

05:59.525 --> 06:00.985
<i>Luca, I hear you.</i>

06:01.819 --> 06:05.073
<i>The momentum of his motion starts making
the water move around.</i>

06:05.156 --> 06:06.074
<i>Copy.</i>

06:08.242 --> 06:12.288
<i>It then sloshed over his eyes
and covered his nose,</i>

06:13.039 --> 06:16.125
<i>and because of the helmet,
he can't wipe the water off of his face.</i>

06:18.169 --> 06:20.380
<i>His sound was intermittent.
A little bit, you could hear...</i>

06:23.466 --> 06:25.593
<i>This is not good.
There is more of that water.</i>

06:26.135 --> 06:28.471
<i>Okay, we're back with you, Luca.
Can you give us a status?</i>

06:29.764 --> 06:31.682
<i>I can barely speak to you.</i>

06:32.642 --> 06:33.684
<i>It's my visor...</i>

06:41.651 --> 06:43.027
<i>Chris, can you help me?</i>

06:43.611 --> 06:45.446
<i>I hear you weak, Luca.</i>

06:46.489 --> 06:47.949
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

06:51.369 --> 06:53.037
<i>I'm opening the airlock cover.</i>

06:53.538 --> 06:54.539
<i>Get on in.</i>

06:55.039 --> 06:56.249
<i>Coming home, Luca.</i>

06:57.041 --> 06:59.752
<i>Chris, you will come in second
and do the hatch ops.</i>

07:01.003 --> 07:03.005
<i>Okay, Shane,
the hatch is closed and locked</i>

07:03.089 --> 07:05.049
<i>and I'm... with you.</i>

07:05.258 --> 07:08.344
<i>Copy. Okay,
here comes the equalization.</i>

07:08.636 --> 07:10.680
<i>We cannot do anything for Luca.</i>

07:10.763 --> 07:13.850
<i>The only thing that matters here
is getting air pressure</i>

07:13.933 --> 07:16.436
<i>back into the airlock
where we can get his helmet off.</i>

07:16.936 --> 07:19.981
<i>Removing Luca's helmet before that
would be fatal.</i>

07:21.315 --> 07:23.860
<i>Hey, Luca, from Houston,
how are you doing? Give us the status.</i>

07:26.070 --> 07:27.280
<i>Luca, do you hear that?</i>

07:30.032 --> 07:32.118
<i>Squeeze my hand if you're fine, Luc--</i>

07:35.913 --> 07:37.582
<i>Shane, I don't think he can...</i>

07:38.499 --> 07:40.084
<i>I'm trying to see him.</i>

07:42.753 --> 07:45.214
<i>-Here, squeeze my hand.
- Everything okay?</i>

07:46.883 --> 07:49.343
<i>Karen, you're go to press.
- Okay.</i>

07:50.636 --> 07:51.679
<i>Hatch coming open.</i>

07:52.430 --> 07:54.599
<i>Are you okay?</i>

08:03.941 --> 08:06.903
<i>This is a Special Report from ABC News.</i>

08:07.278 --> 08:09.906
A close call
at the International Space Station.

08:10.239 --> 08:16.162
<i>An astronaut, Italy's Luca Parmitano,
risked drowning inside his own helmet.</i>

08:16.787 --> 08:19.499
<i>They're all complete. We'll get these guys
changed and finished up.</i>

08:19.582 --> 08:22.543
<i>Great job, great team effort,
getting those guys out of the suit</i>

08:22.627 --> 08:24.295
<i>in a timely manner...</i>

08:24.378 --> 08:27.798
<i>Any given mission can end
in a catastrophic way.</i>

08:29.592 --> 08:31.636
<i>And pushing the boundaries of knowledge,</i>

08:32.720 --> 08:36.641
<i>pushing the boundaries of exploring
is what humans do.</i>

08:38.601 --> 08:39.852
<i>And we get to do that...</i>

08:41.437 --> 08:43.189
<i>we get to do that in space.</i>

09:12.468 --> 09:15.805
<i>If you can hear me
clap one time. Very good!</i>

09:15.888 --> 09:19.642
<i>We are so excited to have a special guest
here straight from NASA.</i>

09:19.767 --> 09:22.812
You're gonna be really amazed
by this presenter today.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.399
This is Chris Cassidy.
He's a NASA astronaut.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.485
What?

09:29.986 --> 09:35.199
Thank you. I love hearing your questions,
so please fire away with your questions.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.160
How many times have I been to space?
Two times.

09:38.244 --> 09:41.622
Once on a Space Shuttle
and once on a Russian Soyuz rocket,

09:41.706 --> 09:45.668
so I'll be going again
in probably early next year,

09:45.751 --> 09:49.422
a little bit about a year from right now,
I'll be launching again. Yes, sir?

09:49.505 --> 09:51.799
What do you do up there?

09:52.216 --> 09:55.636
We spend most of our day
doing science experiments.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.888
Cool.
- The space station is big.

09:58.139 --> 10:00.808
The space station is like the size
of a football field,

10:01.350 --> 10:03.936
and that's where we're gonna live
for six whole months.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.523
How do you pee and poop
in space?

10:07.648 --> 10:10.526
- How do you pee and poop in space?

10:11.193 --> 10:15.531
Our pee is collected, and a machine turns
it into drinking water.

10:15.615 --> 10:19.118
Ew!
- As thanks, we took care of your school,

10:19.201 --> 10:21.537
so your water system has the same thing,

10:21.621 --> 10:26.125
and tomorrow you'll be drinking
the coffee from today.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.716
<i>Luca and I are finally getting
a chance to go back up to space.</i>

10:36.218 --> 10:40.097
<i>I've been an astronaut
for coming up on 16 years now.</i>

10:41.432 --> 10:44.477
<i>Being an astronaut I've realized
over the years is a true privilege</i>

10:45.186 --> 10:49.190
<i>because I'm no one that's any different,
no one special.</i>

10:51.025 --> 10:53.194
<i>It's just that I'm doing a special job.</i>

11:12.713 --> 11:13.798
Hey, there.

11:14.590 --> 11:19.845
<i>At the beginning, you're in awe
that you're now inside the club.</i>

11:20.304 --> 11:21.847
<i>All right, Houston, we've had a problem.</i>

11:22.014 --> 11:23.974
<i>Standby, they're saying
we're looking at it.</i>

11:25.267 --> 11:30.147
<i>Three, two, one, zero,
ignition.</i>

11:33.442 --> 11:35.194
<i>First, you walk in and you think,</i>

11:35.319 --> 11:38.406
<i>"Man, it's just
a nondescript government building."</i>

11:40.825 --> 11:44.286
<i>But what makes them special is the history
and the people</i>

11:44.370 --> 11:47.915
<i>and the cool stories that have emanated
from those buildings.</i>

11:48.207 --> 11:50.835
<i>Okay, I'm out.
It looks beautiful.</i>

11:51.001 --> 11:52.461
<i>I feel like
a million dollars.</i>

11:52.586 --> 11:54.463
<i>Lift off,
we have a lift off!</i>

11:54.547 --> 11:58.217
<i>In this same office were original
astronauts.</i>

11:58.759 --> 12:04.724
<i>That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.</i>

12:06.767 --> 12:10.354
<i>It's just such a cool place to work
and the history that's there.</i>

12:11.689 --> 12:14.233
<i>-And now we're a part of it.</i>

12:18.404 --> 12:20.906
<i>Welcome to
the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory,</i>

12:21.365 --> 12:25.411
<i>our training classroom
for doing spacewalks,</i>

12:25.578 --> 12:27.830
and as you can see it's a giant pool...

12:29.165 --> 12:33.169
and we try to mimic as best we can
a real spacewalk,

12:33.252 --> 12:36.422
down to every last detail,
and this is where it all happens.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.015
<i>Luca and I have started
the training for an entirely new mission.</i>

12:47.641 --> 12:51.520
<i>It'll be my third trip to space
and could well be my last.</i>

12:53.439 --> 12:58.569
Chris and I finished our last spacewalk
in a way that cemented our friendship.

13:00.154 --> 13:03.407
<i>When they told me
that I would be participating,</i>

13:03.741 --> 13:05.534
<i>I thought, "This is perfect."</i>

13:06.619 --> 13:08.996
<i>I would be the best assistant...</i>

13:09.121 --> 13:12.208
<i>...I would be the best EV2
that Chris could ever ask for,</i>

13:12.291 --> 13:16.837
<i>and we'll go out and we'll be
this dream team going out again.</i>

13:18.672 --> 13:20.966
EV1, copy.
Copy on one.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.470
Crane operator, hoist the subjects
into the water, just below the surface.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.807
Crane hoisting subjects
into the water.

13:30.559 --> 13:34.980
<i>ECS, EV2, if you could play
"Don't Stop Believing" for Chris,</i>

13:35.064 --> 13:36.232
<i>that'd be great.</i>

13:36.315 --> 13:38.067
<i>Chris, I know how much
you love that song.</i>

13:39.068 --> 13:39.985
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:45.699 --> 13:46.826
<i>You're welcome.</i>

13:50.329 --> 13:52.122
EV1 and EV2,
how's the volume?

13:52.289 --> 13:53.707
<i>EV2, loud and clear.</i>

13:54.291 --> 13:56.377
And I copy you loud
and clear. EV1, how do you copy?

13:56.460 --> 13:57.878
<i>Likewise, loud and clear.</i>

13:58.337 --> 14:01.090
<i>A singer in a smokey room...</i>

14:01.507 --> 14:03.884
<i>And TC are you on the line?</i>
- Copy.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.095
<i>That's our comms check.
Y'all have a great run.</i>

14:06.178 --> 14:08.180
<i>Thank you.
EV1, how's your way out?</i>

14:08.389 --> 14:09.390
<i>Great.</i>

14:09.515 --> 14:12.268
<i>Copy that. You can go
and take EV1 to worksite, good job divers.</i>

14:13.561 --> 14:18.440
<i>Strangers, waitin'
In the night...</i>

14:18.524 --> 14:22.319
<i>As astronauts, Luca and I
are sitting at the tip of the iceberg,</i>

14:23.112 --> 14:25.406
<i>but there's a huge team of people
that work day and night</i>

14:25.573 --> 14:29.702
<i>to allow an expedition to happen,
including scientists, engineers</i>

14:29.785 --> 14:34.081
<i>and technicians, flight controllers
and the spacewalk office.</i>

14:36.792 --> 14:38.377
<i>My name is Brian Mader.</i>

14:38.460 --> 14:42.756
I train astronauts and I train them
to do spacewalks, specifically.

14:42.882 --> 14:46.802
And then during the spacewalks,
I'm sitting in the Mission Control Center

14:46.886 --> 14:49.305
<i>helping them walk through all
of that process.</i>

14:49.805 --> 14:52.391
I'm a space geek like everybody at NASA,
right?

14:53.642 --> 14:56.645
<i>Mostly working
in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, the big pool.</i>

14:57.104 --> 15:00.691
<i>We've got mockups of the space station we
can work with underwater.</i>

15:01.859 --> 15:05.613
<i>We put astronauts in spacesuits
and it's like floating in space.</i>

15:06.864 --> 15:10.284
<i>You watch a spacewalk on TV
and it looks so graceful,</i>

15:10.367 --> 15:13.329
<i>they're just floating around.
It looks easy, right?</i>

15:13.746 --> 15:16.582
<i>But the suit is very difficult to work in.</i>

15:17.708 --> 15:20.878
<i>You don't have much dexterity
because you're wearing big gloves.</i>

15:21.086 --> 15:23.130
<i>So, every time you're squeezing your hand,</i>

15:23.255 --> 15:26.175
<i>you're fighting that four pounds
of pressure in the glove</i>

15:26.383 --> 15:27.676
<i>which doesn't sound like much,</i>

15:27.760 --> 15:30.846
but, you know, if you were to take
a tennis ball and sit there and squeeze it

15:30.930 --> 15:34.850
for six or seven hours,
you'd probably get a little bit tired.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.478
Chris, what you got for me?

15:38.187 --> 15:43.067
<i>All right, I am doing
my thing here. And Luca, you good?</i>

15:43.400 --> 15:45.152
<i>Um...
What do you need?</i>

15:45.235 --> 15:46.987
<i>I'm gonna be a little slower,
sorry about that.</i>

15:47.112 --> 15:48.364
<i>No, it's no problem, man.</i>

15:48.447 --> 15:50.824
<i>All right. It's gonna be
something different in space,</i>

15:50.908 --> 15:52.534
<i>but you know, you and I both know that.</i>

15:52.618 --> 15:54.995
<i>Yeah, there's always something.
There's always something.</i>

15:58.290 --> 16:01.752
<i>On my next mission, Luca
and I will be involved with the repair</i>

16:01.835 --> 16:05.673
<i>of a very expensive, large experiment
on the outside of the space station,</i>

16:05.839 --> 16:07.007
<i>called AMS.</i>

16:08.092 --> 16:11.136
<i>AMS stands
for Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.</i>

16:14.348 --> 16:16.266
<i>It's a two billion-dollar
science experiment</i>

16:16.350 --> 16:18.936
<i>built to determine the origins
of the universe.</i>

16:31.448 --> 16:34.910
<i>If you ask a scientist
or a physicist or an engineer</i>

16:34.994 --> 16:38.205
<i>how to go about repairing a spectrometer,</i>

16:38.414 --> 16:42.459
<i>they would probably cringe a little bit
because it's such a delicate machine.</i>

16:43.168 --> 16:45.629
<i>It's easier to break than to fix.</i>

16:46.422 --> 16:50.050
<i>To do that in space,
it's so much more complex.</i>

16:51.844 --> 16:55.514
<i>Brian, I think that's it, right?
Like that would be the final thing?</i>

16:55.848 --> 16:57.933
<i>You got it.
And safety divers,</i>

16:58.017 --> 17:00.269
<i>you're good to take your subjects back
to the dawning stand.</i>

17:01.478 --> 17:03.147
<i>So, thank you guys
for all your work today,</i>

17:03.230 --> 17:04.273
<i>both Chris and Luca.</i>

17:04.356 --> 17:07.317
Thank you to the dive team too,
we really appreciate all your hard work.

17:09.653 --> 17:12.740
<i>Chris has always been a friend
and a mentor to me,</i>

17:13.073 --> 17:19.079
<i>but on this trip back, I will help mentor
another friend and astronaut, Drew Morgan.</i>

17:21.415 --> 17:22.833
Looking good there, Drew.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.334
Good to see you.
You doing all right?

17:24.460 --> 17:25.544
Good to see you.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.465
<i>Drew is a first time flyer</i>

17:29.673 --> 17:33.385
<i>and he and I will launch together
with Chris joining us at a later date.</i>

17:34.845 --> 17:39.433
I consider myself someone
who was inspired early on by astronauts

17:39.641 --> 17:44.063
growing up in the 1980s, seeing
the Space Shuttle, watching it on TV,

17:44.480 --> 17:47.608
<i>so I always looked at astronauts
as something to aspire to be</i>

17:47.733 --> 17:51.487
<i>and I was drawn to the idea
of space exploration.</i>

17:54.073 --> 17:55.616
<i>Chris is an experienced astronaut.</i>

17:55.949 --> 17:58.952
<i>He flew twice before, including once
on the Shuttle</i>

17:59.328 --> 18:00.996
<i>and Luca has flown before too.</i>

18:01.371 --> 18:02.915
<i>It's pretty awesome to be learning
from the best</i>

18:02.998 --> 18:04.833
<i>as I train for my first spaceflight.</i>

18:06.335 --> 18:08.378
<i>-I feel pretty fortunate.</i>

18:22.559 --> 18:25.521
<i>This time I'm really excited
about sharing my return to space</i>

18:25.646 --> 18:26.855
<i>with my friends and family.</i>

18:28.690 --> 18:31.235
<i>And most of my extended family
is in the New England area.</i>

18:34.071 --> 18:35.906
Doesn't it feel good
when you come home?

18:36.031 --> 18:37.199
Yeah.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.827
Maine, it was a great place to grow up.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.500
<i>Oh, I'm so proud of him, really.</i>

18:48.252 --> 18:51.004
Never in a million years thought
that he would become an astronaut.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.340
Yeah. I don't think he did either.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.300
- You should do a documentary!
We're live.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.385
Yep.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.178
Are you really?
- You're on it.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.809
<i>First of all, he wanted
to be a SEAL</i>

19:04.017 --> 19:07.271
<i>and he's excelled in the SEAL teams</i>

19:07.437 --> 19:10.649
<i>and he was the top of his class
and that takes a lot.</i>

19:12.067 --> 19:18.240
<i>He can fix anything, so he's a perfect fit
for being up in the space station.</i>

19:18.407 --> 19:22.828
You know, if the toilet breaks, you need
to be able to fix the toilet!

19:24.413 --> 19:25.831
You worked at this place?
I worked here.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.499
He was a bouncer here.
I was a bouncer...

19:27.624 --> 19:30.627
He was like 16 years old.
...and a dish boy,

19:30.711 --> 19:31.670
I did everything.

19:32.087 --> 19:36.175
<i>-My brother and I have always been close.</i>
- We never went anywhere,

19:36.258 --> 19:38.177
Chris and I, without a football.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.346
<i>He played quarterback.
Accurate passer, good arm.</i>

19:41.471 --> 19:45.726
<i>I think playing quarterback gave him
good practice as a leader.</i>

19:48.604 --> 19:51.690
<i>Chris and I have been together
about five years.</i>

19:52.691 --> 19:56.820
<i>Even though I work at NASA,
this will be a new experience for me.</i>

19:57.905 --> 20:02.242
<i>It's gonna be tough when he goes
for six months up in space</i>

20:02.701 --> 20:05.287
<i>because that's my best friend.</i>

20:05.621 --> 20:10.459
He makes my coffee every morning,
so that to me is going to be something

20:10.542 --> 20:13.212
that'll be like, "Hey, where's that guy
that makes my coffee every day?"

20:14.838 --> 20:17.049
- Hey!

20:22.554 --> 20:24.097
Aww.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.767
Yours is more like a pear.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.325
<i>This is Shuttle launch control.</i>

20:43.408 --> 20:44.993
<i>Space Shuttle Endeavour is poised</i>

20:45.077 --> 20:48.413
<i>awaiting the beginning
of the STS-127 mission.</i>

20:50.040 --> 20:53.961
<i>Christopher Cassidy, who will become
the 500th human in space</i>

20:54.086 --> 20:55.379
<i>when Endeavour launches.</i>

20:57.005 --> 20:58.423
<i>Two thumbs up today.</i>

20:59.007 --> 21:01.593
<i>I have flown
in space two previous times.</i>

21:02.261 --> 21:05.973
<i>My first mission
on the space shuttle was 2009.</i>

21:09.601 --> 21:11.812
<i>Have an excellent mission
and Godspeed.</i>

21:14.231 --> 21:17.442
<i>Chris Cassidy is fired up,
handshakes all the way around.</i>

21:17.609 --> 21:18.986
<i>He is ready to fly.</i>

21:19.611 --> 21:24.366
<i>For me, as a new guy,
it gave me chills thinking about it like,</i>

21:24.449 --> 21:26.952
<i>"Okay, it is game on."</i>

21:28.954 --> 21:32.207
<i>And the clock kept ticking down
and finally the shuttle</i>

21:32.374 --> 21:35.294
at T-minus six seconds,
the main engines light.

21:35.919 --> 21:37.546
<i>Okay, now,
the main engines start.</i>

21:38.922 --> 21:41.967
And then finally at T-zero, the solid
rocket motors light.

21:47.764 --> 21:50.225
<i>It's going. It's leaving the pad.</i>

21:56.231 --> 22:00.277
And it's very bumpy and violent.
I didn't know anything what to experience.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.281
<i>And I think, "Okay, everything's fine."</i>

22:04.781 --> 22:07.409
<i>I just remember taking a mirror
and looking up</i>

22:07.492 --> 22:09.703
<i>and seeing the flames and the smoke.</i>

22:15.959 --> 22:19.379
Um, and I remember thinking, "Wow."

22:24.426 --> 22:27.179
<i>But NASA retired
the space shuttle in 2011.</i>

22:29.056 --> 22:31.308
<i>And with NASA's partners,
SpaceX and Boeing,</i>

22:31.391 --> 22:33.685
<i>behind schedule
on their commercial rockets...</i>

22:34.770 --> 22:36.938
<i>We have had
a launch vehicle failure.</i>

22:37.022 --> 22:38.774
<i>...the only way to get
to the space station</i>

22:38.857 --> 22:40.442
<i>is on a Russian Soyuz rocket.</i>

22:41.318 --> 22:43.779
<i>The Soyuz launches four times a year
from Kazakhstan</i>

22:43.945 --> 22:47.574
<i>taking astronauts and cosmonauts
to the International Space Station</i>

22:47.824 --> 22:49.701
<i>for missions that usually last six months.</i>

22:51.161 --> 22:53.830
<i>Each space agency has to buy a seat
on the rocket</i>

22:53.914 --> 22:55.665
<i>to send their astronauts to space.</i>

22:56.500 --> 22:59.169
<i>The European Space Agency has confirmed</i>

22:59.252 --> 23:02.464
<i>a seat for Luca to launch in July of 2019
and he'll fly</i>

23:02.547 --> 23:04.591
<i>with our NASA rookie astronaut,
Drew Morgan.</i>

23:04.925 --> 23:07.469
<i>While NASA is still in negotiations
for me to launch</i>

23:07.844 --> 23:10.430
<i>and join them in October 2019</i>

23:10.514 --> 23:12.057
<i>which will give us
about a three-month window</i>

23:12.182 --> 23:14.059
<i>to conduct the AMS spacewalks.</i>

23:14.518 --> 23:18.397
<i>But first, NASA astronaut Nick Hague
and cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin</i>

23:18.522 --> 23:22.484
<i>launch for their six-month expedition
to the International Space Station.</i>

23:27.697 --> 23:30.200
<i>Nick Hague
and now Aleksey Ovchinin</i>

23:30.283 --> 23:33.245
<i>making their way up to the elevator
that will take them</i>

23:33.328 --> 23:35.163
<i>to the top of the Soyuz to board.</i>

23:37.749 --> 23:40.627
<i>Final goodbyes from the stairs
of the launchpad.</i>

23:43.964 --> 23:46.258
<i>Command for ignition.
Oxygen.</i>

23:46.716 --> 23:48.301
<i>Launch command
has been issued.</i>

23:48.510 --> 23:54.433
<i>Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.</i>

23:58.770 --> 24:03.817
<i>And there is liftoff of the Soyuz MS10
to the International Space Station</i>

24:03.942 --> 24:06.695
<i>carrying Nick Hague and Aleksey Ovchinin.</i>

24:10.157 --> 24:13.034
<i>Everything proceeding as intended
for today's flight</i>

24:13.118 --> 24:14.744
<i>now just a little over a minute into it.</i>

24:21.334 --> 24:22.752
<i>Following procedure.</i>

24:27.299 --> 24:29.134
<i>There has been an issue
with the booster</i>

24:29.217 --> 24:31.178
<i>and we're standing by for information.</i>

24:57.579 --> 24:59.915
<i>I knew that the launch
was about to happen,</i>

25:00.332 --> 25:01.875
<i>then I looked round the corner</i>

25:02.000 --> 25:06.171
<i>and looked at the TV and, sure enough,
"Wow, they just aborted. Unbelievable."</i>

25:06.338 --> 25:08.673
Breaking news. An emergency
for rookie American astronaut

25:08.882 --> 25:11.176
and a veteran cosmonaut today.

25:11.259 --> 25:15.055
They were on a Russian rocket
that failed two minutes after launch.

25:15.305 --> 25:18.808
<i>There's no word about what caused
the booster rocket to fail.</i>

25:18.975 --> 25:21.978
Russia has now grounded
all manned rocket launches

25:22.103 --> 25:24.272
while it looks into what went wrong here.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.693
<i>And then a couple of days later,
starting to think about,</i>

25:28.777 --> 25:30.278
<i>"Okay, what's the impact now?"</i>

25:30.362 --> 25:33.031
<i>Okay, they're safe. They're home.
Everything's fine.</i>

25:33.698 --> 25:37.327
<i>But moving forward, how's it gonna impact
all these other crews?</i>

25:37.410 --> 25:40.330
And therefore, what's the impact to me?

26:07.774 --> 26:10.527
<i>Your call
has been forwarded to an automatic...</i>

26:43.476 --> 26:45.020
<i>I've just got some bad news.</i>

26:45.812 --> 26:49.399
<i>With the recent Soyuz abort,
the launch schedule has been changed.</i>

26:50.984 --> 26:52.861
<i>Because my seat was never confirmed,</i>

26:53.695 --> 26:56.281
<i>it means I won't be up
there in time to do the AMS.</i>

26:59.701 --> 27:01.244
It's just, um...

27:02.412 --> 27:05.040
a lot of moving parts and...

27:06.374 --> 27:07.417
Yeah, I don't know.

27:08.209 --> 27:09.544
I don't know what I want to say.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.172
That's good.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.799
<i>It means that Drew,
who is confirmed</i>

27:14.883 --> 27:16.760
<i>to fly on the next rocket with Luca,</i>

27:17.385 --> 27:20.055
<i>will be up there and the two of them
will do the repairs.</i>

27:21.973 --> 27:24.726
<i>I'll do everything in my control
to not give up on it.</i>

27:26.895 --> 27:29.356
<i>I want to be part of that team.</i>

27:31.191 --> 27:35.153
It... I don't know. I don't know
how to go from here,

27:35.236 --> 27:38.698
but do I want to be part of
AMS Repairs? Yes.

27:58.927 --> 28:03.098
<i>The Flight Director is responsible
for the planning, the training</i>

28:03.223 --> 28:05.850
<i>and the actual execution
of spaceflight missions.</i>

28:06.810 --> 28:09.354
If you've seen Apollo 13, the guy
in the vest. That's our job.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.357
<i>Hey, let's make sure
we don't blow the whole mission.</i>

28:13.149 --> 28:16.236
<i>-Okay, Aquarius, you're looking good.</i>

28:16.736 --> 28:18.530
From then till the next one.

28:19.155 --> 28:21.408
<i>I was working
with our crew office to determine</i>

28:22.117 --> 28:24.494
who do we think is gonna be
on board at the right time

28:24.619 --> 28:26.579
<i>to execute the AMS EVAs.</i>

28:31.835 --> 28:35.714
<i>We figured out that Luca
and Drew are in space at the right time</i>

28:35.797 --> 28:37.966
<i>and so it makes sense for them
to repair it.</i>

28:38.425 --> 28:41.261
<i>So we decided to focus on the two of them</i>

28:42.011 --> 28:43.930
<i>and making sure that we had a couple
of runs</i>

28:44.013 --> 28:45.515
<i>with the two of them together.</i>

28:46.182 --> 28:49.394
<i>Loader two.
I remember where it goes.</i>

28:49.769 --> 28:51.187
<i>And then I can get back here...</i>

28:51.271 --> 28:54.232
<i>My path led me
to attending West Point,</i>

28:54.315 --> 28:57.277
<i>becoming an army officer
and then a physician.</i>

28:58.278 --> 29:01.072
<i>I think that might have been something
that really stood out about me,</i>

29:01.156 --> 29:05.452
<i>a physician who had taken care
of specially trained soldiers.</i>

29:05.869 --> 29:08.329
<i>Operating in combat,
under austere conditions.</i>

29:08.705 --> 29:11.291
<i>You can see that the parallels
of then being part</i>

29:11.374 --> 29:13.710
<i>of an expedition in space, very similar.</i>

29:14.169 --> 29:18.006
And maybe it didn't really set in until
after I was selected as an astronaut.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.809
<i>We have just
a really short period of time</i>

29:30.059 --> 29:33.438
<i>to fill Drew and Luca's brains
with everything AMS.</i>

29:33.938 --> 29:36.524
<i>That's where all my attention is going.</i>

29:36.608 --> 29:41.946
Anything I can do to help them
be successful is what I want to do.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.533
Can you feel the taper?
There's a taper in there.

29:45.658 --> 29:47.410
Yeah. No, it's really obvious.

29:48.745 --> 29:54.167
<i>I was training with Chris
to be his support.</i>

29:54.876 --> 29:59.547
I was really counting on his presence,
I was counting on his leadership in orbit.

30:00.256 --> 30:04.219
<i>His knowledge of everything
that he's been doing so far</i>

30:04.302 --> 30:05.553
<i>to get ready for this.</i>

30:07.013 --> 30:09.265
But then I go in between
or completely around?

30:09.349 --> 30:12.352
I think the best way is to go down
and around.

30:12.435 --> 30:14.687
- That's what you're saying.
- Yeah, we'll figure it out.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.982
<i>And then Drew jumped in
and in very little time</i>

30:18.066 --> 30:20.109
<i>he had to learn everything from scratch.</i>

30:20.318 --> 30:23.488
There's a lot of risk in taking a guy like
me, a rookie,

30:23.738 --> 30:26.115
and putting me into this position

30:26.282 --> 30:29.619
<i>where Luca and I are getting
ready to do these spacewalks together</i>

30:29.702 --> 30:31.788
<i>and all the preparation that has gone
into it.</i>

30:32.705 --> 30:35.875
So many times, where, like, we dig down
into the procedure, and I'm like,

30:35.959 --> 30:37.669
"I have no idea
what we're doing right now."

30:37.752 --> 30:40.213
I can't believe
that I'm gonna get to do this

30:40.338 --> 30:42.632
and that I'm getting
all this dedicated training

30:42.715 --> 30:44.634
for this special set of spacewalks.

30:44.884 --> 30:47.929
It's pretty rigid. I mean,
this is a flight light here. It does...

30:48.763 --> 30:50.014
Yeah, once that's folded.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.475
Oh, no, no, no, not that. This.

30:54.894 --> 30:59.440
I'm Heather Bergman.
I am a Project Manager for EVA Tools.

30:59.816 --> 31:02.151
<i>So, we design the tools
that the astronauts use</i>

31:02.235 --> 31:03.111
<i>on their spacewalks.</i>

31:04.571 --> 31:10.618
So, the astronauts have so many tools.
This is a tool board for this set of EVAs.

31:11.452 --> 31:13.913
So, one of the things that Drew
will be doing is,

31:13.997 --> 31:16.249
as Luca's working inside AMS,

31:16.332 --> 31:19.252
Drew will pull this tool out
and hand that over to Luca

31:19.377 --> 31:22.422
and bring it back.
And then swap this one for the next one.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.550
<i>Okay, I think I'm ready
for the ratchet wrench.</i>

31:25.675 --> 31:28.052
<i>Okay, here we go. Got it.</i>

31:28.261 --> 31:31.097
<i>He's got a full-time job
making sure he doesn't lose track</i>

31:31.180 --> 31:34.517
of what tool is where
because if he can't find something,

31:34.726 --> 31:36.895
- everything has to stop.

31:42.692 --> 31:43.693
Okay.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.946
So, to put your tape on,
you've got to put it on there

31:47.030 --> 31:48.239
and clamp it down.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.200
<i>Trying to manage all of these tools</i>

31:51.451 --> 31:53.995
<i>is gonna be a big challenge
for any astronaut.</i>

31:57.540 --> 32:00.251
Luca's going out and taking care
of the debris shield,

32:00.460 --> 32:02.670
while Drew is taking bags
out to the worksite.

32:03.129 --> 32:05.006
<i>Most of the team didn't even know
who I was.</i>

32:05.131 --> 32:07.634
<i>I mean, I was like, "Hey, guys, looks like
I'm gonna be the guy."</i>

32:07.884 --> 32:10.011
<i>I never could have imagined
that on my first flight</i>

32:10.094 --> 32:13.932
that I was gonna participate
in an EVA series of this magnitude.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.018
<i>It's just beyond my wildest imagination.</i>

32:17.352 --> 32:18.853
I've been looking forward
to this six hours

32:18.937 --> 32:21.064
- underwater together.
- Yeah, it will be fun.

32:21.397 --> 32:23.942
And seven months in space.
- And seven months in space!

32:31.407 --> 32:34.994
-"Luca and Drew. On your final NBL run."
- Awesome! Let's cut.

32:35.703 --> 32:38.289
<i>And this is it. We've done all the
training we can.</i>

32:38.373 --> 32:42.335
We're off to Russia, then Kazakhstan,
then launch to the ISS.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.881
<i>The next time that we see the team,
or we talk to them, we'll be in space</i>

32:47.256 --> 32:50.927
<i>before we go out the door
for the actual EVA.</i>

32:55.515 --> 32:58.518
Thank you guys.
- See you Friday.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.384
Okay.

33:31.884 --> 33:33.261
All right. You got it!

33:34.095 --> 33:37.223
<i>All right. Talk to you later.</i>
- All right, thanks. See ya. Bye-bye.

33:39.851 --> 33:43.646
<i>I'm Ken Bollweg,
and I'm the Project Manager for NASA</i>

33:43.896 --> 33:46.024
<i>on the Alpha Magnetic
Spectrometer project.</i>

33:47.984 --> 33:50.194
<i>I say it's a project,
it's become a career.</i>

33:52.363 --> 33:56.200
<i>I've been working on it since 1994.
So, it's been 25 years.</i>

33:57.910 --> 34:02.331
<i>And I can remember the first time
we met with Professor Ting back in 1994,</i>

34:02.415 --> 34:05.877
<i>he got up there and explained
the experiment that he wanted to fly</i>

34:06.294 --> 34:08.588
and every bit of it just went...

34:08.838 --> 34:10.840
...over everyone's heads.
It's like we're all looking

34:10.923 --> 34:13.509
at each other going, "Where...
What planet is this guy from?"

34:13.593 --> 34:16.304
"What is he talking about? Um, no idea."

34:18.806 --> 34:21.017
<i>We're always looking
for where we came from, okay.</i>

34:21.100 --> 34:23.186
<i>We're always looking for the origins
of the universe.</i>

34:24.103 --> 34:27.815
<i>We can detect this many planets,
this many galaxies, this many stars,</i>

34:28.357 --> 34:29.817
<i>but from the math,</i>

34:30.234 --> 34:34.405
<i>we're only seeing maybe three
to ten percent of what we should see.</i>

34:35.198 --> 34:38.618
<i>So, the rest of it we call dark matter
because we don't understand it.</i>

34:38.701 --> 34:39.911
<i>We can't detect it.</i>

34:41.370 --> 34:44.791
<i>And that's the purpose of AMS,
is to look for antimatter.</i>

34:46.709 --> 34:49.337
<i>AMS has been up there for eight
and a half years so far</i>

34:49.420 --> 34:52.840
<i>and it's been rewriting the physics books
almost since the beginning.</i>

34:56.719 --> 35:01.599
<i>The AMS gets great results
because of Professor Ting.</i>

35:02.308 --> 35:04.143
<i>Without him, it wouldn't exist.</i>

35:07.605 --> 35:09.273
<i>The Nobel Prize in physics,</i>

35:09.524 --> 35:13.778
<i>the scientific discoveries. I mean,
he's one of a kind. He really is.</i>

35:14.737 --> 35:18.199
For ten years, I've led experiment

35:18.616 --> 35:22.578
to put a magnetic device
on the space station.

35:23.621 --> 35:26.374
<i>Professor Ting ended up talking
to various science advisors</i>

35:26.457 --> 35:28.209
<i>and various members of Congress,</i>

35:28.292 --> 35:30.336
<i>explained the story,
what he was trying to do,</i>

35:30.419 --> 35:32.880
<i>the international corroboration
that he had formed</i>

35:33.047 --> 35:34.674
to do this incredible detector.

35:34.757 --> 35:38.052
<i>The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.</i>

35:38.261 --> 35:42.515
It is looked upon
as a scientific experiment

35:42.974 --> 35:47.895
that possibly several Nobel Prizes
will come as a result.

35:48.729 --> 35:50.815
But, Mr. President, we've got to get
it up there!

35:51.774 --> 35:55.361
They took his mission forward.
And eventually, it was written into law.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.406
<i>NASA, you'll fly
the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer,</i>

35:58.531 --> 35:59.866
<i>and here's the money to do so.</i>

36:00.324 --> 36:02.577
<i>We were just flabbergasted to think,
"Oh, my gosh,</i>

36:02.869 --> 36:05.413
<i>"this guy just got a Space Shuttle flight
added for him."</i>

36:05.955 --> 36:09.167
<i>And this was years after his original ride
to the space station was cancelled.</i>

36:09.458 --> 36:10.626
<i>Who does that?</i>

36:22.722 --> 36:27.101
<i>Professor Ting is so intimidating.</i>

36:31.147 --> 36:36.402
When he desires something to happen,
it's gonna happen.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.239
<i>It's his baby, and his team of people</i>

36:40.323 --> 36:42.783
<i>that designed it, built it,
and operate it.</i>

36:47.246 --> 36:49.832
<i>NASA has only one shot to fix AMS.</i>

36:51.792 --> 36:53.711
<i>So, he wants to meet with us today</i>

36:53.794 --> 36:55.796
<i>to learn what the plans are
for the spacewalks.</i>

36:59.050 --> 37:02.970
<i>AMS being a very expensive,
very high-profile experiment,</i>

37:03.638 --> 37:06.682
<i>there's so many things that can go wrong
with it. It's so complex.</i>

37:08.017 --> 37:10.144
All right, we'll get things
rolling here.

37:10.311 --> 37:13.397
We're really looking forward to seeing
a successful mission

37:13.481 --> 37:17.818
be completed here later this year.
This is a great opportunity to really talk

37:17.902 --> 37:21.072
to what operations has laid out as a plan.

37:21.322 --> 37:24.992
If we have an issue or a failure on orbit,
what is our next step?

37:25.326 --> 37:28.955
So, for the EVA timelines,
I've got those up here again.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.207
This is the four EVAs.

37:31.457 --> 37:35.586
Please bear with us. This is very much
a document that is in work.

37:35.753 --> 37:40.424
So, it is not a final, polished product
so...

37:43.678 --> 37:45.263
Can you please go back

37:46.055 --> 37:48.057
to the debris shield removal?

37:57.733 --> 38:00.236
Those are the possible problems?

38:01.529 --> 38:03.030
That we've thought of so far.

38:03.531 --> 38:07.868
Alright then. In your judgement,
which one is most likely?

38:11.330 --> 38:14.000
I'm not the right person to answer
that question.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.752
Ken Bollweg should be
able to answer.

38:16.836 --> 38:19.755
I can't tell you which one
is the most likely. It's just that...

38:20.506 --> 38:22.091
even on the ground,
some of these are difficult

38:22.174 --> 38:23.175
- to get to...
- Ground?

38:23.509 --> 38:27.388
With the situation we're putting the crew
in here it's even more so.

38:27.888 --> 38:30.391
Has all this been tried on the ground

38:30.599 --> 38:33.269
or are these theoretical solutions?

38:33.602 --> 38:36.939
Um, I mean, not everything
in this document has been tried

38:37.023 --> 38:39.400
on the ground. Yeah, some
of it is theoretical.

38:43.904 --> 38:47.658
Kind of tricky to try it in space.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.876
I'm trying to think of which of these
has not happened on the ground?

38:56.959 --> 39:00.713
Like, we are trying to assume failures
that we've never seen before

39:00.838 --> 39:04.467
to make sure that we're as prepared
as we can be when these EVAs show up.

39:04.550 --> 39:06.469
So, some of them
aren't that we can't go do it,

39:06.635 --> 39:09.805
it's that we've never seen the failure
on the ground to go try to fix it.

39:10.056 --> 39:11.807
When you get far enough
down the crib sheet,

39:11.891 --> 39:15.561
it's worth taking a shot at it versus say,
because the other option,

39:15.644 --> 39:18.356
if it doesn't work, is just to say,
"Well, I'm out of ideas."

39:18.439 --> 39:21.776
You might as well give it a shot and see
if it's what fixes the solution that day.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.528
Well, when this happens,
you better get my permission.

39:25.696 --> 39:30.326
Because I'm responsible for the experiment
which I want to make very clear.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.038
You do not do things

39:35.122 --> 39:37.083
that we have not tried on the ground.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.835
Are you certain
that you would not want us

39:39.919 --> 39:41.670
to try something that we haven't tried
on the ground?

39:41.754 --> 39:43.589
No, no, no.
I have to give permission.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.718
Do you understand that the reason why we
can't try everything on the ground is

39:47.843 --> 39:50.596
- because we can't simulate every problem?
Of course, of course. No.

39:50.679 --> 39:55.101
And stopping to have lengthy discussions
in the moment can delay the EVAs

39:55.267 --> 39:56.977
to the point that we cannot be successful.

39:57.061 --> 40:00.398
Before you try something new
that you have not tried on the ground

40:00.981 --> 40:04.318
we need to discuss
and I have to tell you "go" or "no go"

40:04.443 --> 40:06.112
because it's my experiment.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.863
Okay, I need you to understand that
that...

40:08.030 --> 40:10.157
No, I understand.
-...could delay completion to the point

40:10.241 --> 40:11.534
that we cannot complete the series.

40:11.784 --> 40:15.913
This is non-negotiable because you
could easily ruin the experiment.

40:16.122 --> 40:17.289
I hope not.

40:23.337 --> 40:25.965
I want to talk to everyone first.

40:29.510 --> 40:33.431
AMS is the only detector of its kind.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.936
If something goes wrong
then it will not be good.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.815
It's a life and death issue.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.280
Thank you.

40:58.372 --> 41:01.917
<i>When dealing with Professor Ting,
there are three paths you can take.</i>

41:02.710 --> 41:05.588
You can stand on the side and watch
that train go by.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.758
<i>You can get on the train.</i>

41:11.927 --> 41:15.264
Or you can be run over by the train.
Those are your options.

42:02.228 --> 42:06.690
<i>You know, five years of preparation,
training, engineering,</i>

42:07.024 --> 42:11.070
<i>all comes down to this moment
when Drew and I will do our job.</i>

42:12.696 --> 42:16.408
<i>We give our contribution to something
that's going to matter.</i>

42:52.695 --> 42:56.115
Drew, Sasha, Luca, you guys look great.

42:56.198 --> 42:58.117
We're looking forward
to having you up in orbit

42:58.325 --> 43:00.494
and accomplishing a great mission.

43:00.786 --> 43:04.582
Have some fun and we'll see you back here
for a soft landing

43:04.665 --> 43:07.167
in the not-too-distant future.
All the best.

43:07.334 --> 43:10.129
Thank you, Mr. Shireman.
Thank you, sir.

43:10.254 --> 43:11.547
I'm ready to go.

43:12.339 --> 43:14.216
You've worked hard for this,
you're gonna do great.

43:14.341 --> 43:15.884
I'm very proud of you.

43:16.051 --> 43:20.055
There are so many people right now
celebrating this mission.

43:20.222 --> 43:22.433
Godspeed baby, I love you.

43:22.516 --> 43:25.060
- I love you, too. We're ready.
The suit suits you.

43:25.311 --> 43:26.437
Thanks.
