<i>Georgie: Oh no, Amy, look!
They're scaring them.</i>

10:18.652 --> 10:21.921
<i>Amy: Those stupid sheep,</i> they're
gonna ruin everything. Come on.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.022
Okay, come on, sheep, get out!

10:23.056 --> 10:25.124
Georgie: Shoo! Shoo!

10:26.927 --> 10:28.260
Oh good, grandpa.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.761
You know I am trying to wean
a foal out there, right,

10:29.796 --> 10:31.596
and these sheep are really
getting in the way.

10:31.631 --> 10:35.367
Don't talk to me. You talk to your father,
he's the one who brought 'em here.

10:35.401 --> 10:36.567
I thought you two
were partners?

10:36.601 --> 10:39.337
Well, that depends on
how you define partners.

10:39.371 --> 10:42.073
According to him,
we're fifty-fifty.

10:42.107 --> 10:44.575
He bought the sheep, but I've
been paying for everything else

10:44.609 --> 10:46.277
in more ways than one.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.779
Okay, so let's just get rid
of them, right now!

10:48.814 --> 10:50.681
Here's the situation.

10:50.716 --> 10:54.617
The longer those sheep are
here, the more money I spend.

10:54.652 --> 10:58.222
Now the more money I spend,
the bigger my share is.

10:58.256 --> 11:02.525
Now, when I add labour,
vet bills, and aggravation

11:02.560 --> 11:06.196
to a carefully calculated
grazing fee,

11:06.231 --> 11:08.965
your dad's fifty percent
will have shrunk so small

11:08.999 --> 11:11.100
I'll practically own
the whole flock myself.

11:11.134 --> 11:12.601
Grandpa, you hate sheep!

11:12.635 --> 11:16.973
I sure do, and when they're mine
I'm gonna sell them so fast

11:17.007 --> 11:19.175
it'll make your head spin.

11:19.209 --> 11:22.478
That'll teach him to dump
those sheep on my land.

11:24.380 --> 11:28.416
You should have seen the look on Lou's
face when I told her about the coffee.

11:28.450 --> 11:30.451
I thought you wanted
to be manager?

11:30.519 --> 11:32.153
Yeah, but according to Lou,

11:32.221 --> 11:35.823
I don't have the maturity
or the experience to do so.

11:35.858 --> 11:37.525
So what are you gonna do?

11:37.559 --> 11:40.194
Well, from now on,
it's work to rule.

11:40.228 --> 11:44.731
If she wants a manager, she can hire
me to do it, or pay someone else.

11:44.766 --> 11:46.566
You sure you really
want this job?

11:46.634 --> 11:50.104
I mean, most people would try to
show their boss they can handle it.

11:51.039 --> 11:55.376
You mean, act like a manager and
she'll see me as a manager.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.476
Yeah, but you're basically
doing the exact opposite,

11:57.511 --> 12:01.414
so it's like
you don't want the job, right?

12:01.481 --> 12:04.717
Oh my gosh,
you are absolutely right!

12:04.751 --> 12:06.519
When did you get so smart?

12:07.487 --> 12:10.423
I've always been smart,
you just never noticed it.

12:13.592 --> 12:15.627
Maybe too smart.

12:18.197 --> 12:19.331
Hey, dad.

12:19.399 --> 12:23.802
Hi, Amy. What can I do for ya?

12:23.869 --> 12:25.503
If you really want to do
something for me,

12:25.571 --> 12:28.505
you could move those sheep that
are at heartland out here.

12:30.008 --> 12:33.377
I'm keeping things going while your
grandfather's waltzing around Arizona.

12:33.445 --> 12:34.912
He was not waltzing, okay?

12:34.980 --> 12:37.081
He was recovering
from a heart attack.

12:37.149 --> 12:40.151
Yeah, well, that's why
I let him in on the deal.

12:40.218 --> 12:43.421
High profits, low maintenance,
perfect for the golden ager.

12:43.488 --> 12:45.521
And I threw in a dog.

12:45.589 --> 12:47.723
And what thanks do I get?
I get nothing but grief.

12:47.791 --> 12:50.060
You know, I am sure
that you meant well, okay?

12:50.127 --> 12:53.129
But I cannot work with those sheep
around, so just load them in a trailer

12:53.197 --> 12:55.265
and bring them up here.

12:55.299 --> 12:58.034
Take a look around.
This is prime cattle country.

12:58.102 --> 13:01.770
You think I'm gonna let a
bunch of sheep eat my grass?

13:04.907 --> 13:08.910
Nicole: Wow! It's so great
you bought this place, Lou!

13:08.945 --> 13:11.347
You know, my grandmother used
to have a cafe just like it.

13:11.381 --> 13:13.015
Lou: Really? You never told me.

13:13.049 --> 13:14.416
Yeah, in high school.

13:14.484 --> 13:18.552
I spent every summer there just
working in the kitchen, waitressing.

13:18.587 --> 13:22.623
Mallory: Enjoy. Hi, guys, how're
the first few bites tasting?

13:22.657 --> 13:23.724
Great.

13:23.792 --> 13:25.293
Lou: Whoa!

13:25.327 --> 13:26.894
Mallory: Bye.

13:26.928 --> 13:28.229
[Phone rings]

13:29.431 --> 13:31.499
Hello, Maggie's.

13:31.533 --> 13:33.867
Yes, I need you guys
to double our order.

13:33.901 --> 13:35.902
Okay, just one second.

13:37.372 --> 13:39.139
Hi, Lou, I'm so happy
you could drop by.

13:39.173 --> 13:42.442
I placed in these orders, I got the
new menus, next week's special,

13:42.510 --> 13:44.277
and the resumes
for the waitress job.

13:44.312 --> 13:45.979
Okay.

13:46.014 --> 13:47.414
Hi, sorry about that.

13:48.515 --> 13:50.649
Okay, thank you. Bye.

13:50.683 --> 13:53.785
Um, mallory,
you remember Nicole?

13:53.820 --> 13:55.388
Nicole, of course.

13:55.422 --> 13:58.590
Let me guess,
two non-fat lattes?

13:58.625 --> 14:00.692
Uh, that sounds great.

14:00.727 --> 14:02.428
I'll get those right away.

14:02.462 --> 14:06.498
Lou, I wanted to apologize
about this morning.

14:06.532 --> 14:10.268
I just remembered why I pushed you into
getting Maggie's in the first place.

14:10.302 --> 14:13.405
Because you lost your job and
you were hoping to get it back?

14:13.439 --> 14:17.675
No, because Maggie's is more
than a cafe and a tack shop.

14:17.709 --> 14:23.380
It's a place to go, to meet with
old friends, to make new friends.

14:23.415 --> 14:28.118
It's a place where you can feel
a part of something.

14:28.153 --> 14:32.056
Anyway, I'm just happy that I
could help make it all possible.

14:33.791 --> 14:37.326
Oh, wow, you really lucked
out with your manager.

14:37.361 --> 14:40.063
Mallory?
She's not the manager.

14:40.997 --> 14:43.332
She wants the job,
but I told her she wasn't ready,

14:43.367 --> 14:46.169
so she's just trying
to impress me.

14:46.236 --> 14:49.838
Well, I was managing my
grandmother's cafe at her age.

14:49.873 --> 14:52.240
Yeah, but mallory is not you.

14:53.209 --> 14:59.747
Here we go, two of Maggie's special
non-fat lattes, voted best in Hudson.

14:59.782 --> 15:02.484
Anything else I can get
for you two?

15:02.552 --> 15:03.985
[Lou sighs]

15:04.053 --> 15:06.388
Okay, mallory, you win.

15:06.456 --> 15:08.189
You want the job, you got it.

15:08.223 --> 15:10.624
Yes! You won't regret this.

Amy: All right, I'm just
gonna hang on to her.

15:22.028 --> 15:22.994
Georgie: What do I do?

15:23.062 --> 15:26.631
I want you to back away and show
shiloh that that grain in the bucket

15:26.699 --> 15:28.433
is way more important
than his mom.

15:28.467 --> 15:30.368
Okay. Here, shiloh!

15:30.436 --> 15:31.536
Come get it!

15:31.570 --> 15:33.871
Come on,
I've got something tasty.

15:33.939 --> 15:34.905

with them, please?

16:08.104 --> 16:10.305

One coffee, no milk, no
sugar, nothing on the side.

16:28.023 --> 16:30.258
So no more working to rule?

16:30.292 --> 16:33.527
Yeah,
I realized you were right.

16:34.529 --> 16:38.464
The only thing I was proving is
that I wasn't manager material.

16:38.532 --> 16:40.400
And besides, who wants to spend
their whole gap year

16:40.434 --> 16:45.238
being a waitress at Maggie's
when they can be manager?

16:45.306 --> 16:46.873
You got the job?

16:46.941 --> 16:49.009
Mallory: Yeah!
Man: Bye, mallory.

16:50.544 --> 16:52.011
What's wrong?

16:52.045 --> 16:54.280
I mean it was your idea.
Aren't you happy for me?

16:54.314 --> 16:55.948
Yeah, of course,

16:57.984 --> 17:00.352
but there are other options.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.054
Such as?

17:02.122 --> 17:06.625
Travel, see the world,
stuff like that.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.727
But if you're happy,
I'm happy.

Can't they do it?

17:34.986 --> 17:37.554
Oh, they can do it -
next Wednesday.

17:37.588 --> 17:39.456
I've only got until tomorrow.

17:39.490 --> 17:41.390
Hmm. You know what?

17:41.891 --> 17:44.827
Yeah, we're gonna herd them
out of here ourselves.

17:44.861 --> 17:47.563
We can take them up across big
river, up to dad's lease land.

17:47.597 --> 17:49.631
That should only take
a couple hours, right?

17:49.666 --> 17:51.100
When do we start?

17:51.168 --> 17:53.102

to go on a trail ride right now.

it's not gonna happen.

to move them, or dad.

20:23.046 --> 20:25.381
Heavy lifting? Oh, come on.

20:25.416 --> 20:29.351
I'm not the bad guy, Jack, those
sheep are worth money in the bank.

20:31.821 --> 20:33.955
Mallory: [Gasps] Oh my gosh!
She swallowed it!

20:33.989 --> 20:35.324
Tim: Just, just...
Mallory: She swallowed a penny!

20:35.358 --> 20:37.593
Okay, come here, honey,
come here, come here.

20:37.627 --> 20:38.727
W-what are you doing?

20:38.761 --> 20:39.994
Tim: I'm gonna do
some first aid.

20:40.062 --> 20:41.896
Don't even think about it.
Mallory, call 9-1-1.

20:41.931 --> 20:45.066
Tim: No we don't have time for 9-1-1,
Jack, let's get her to the hospital.

20:45.101 --> 20:46.300
Let me see now.

20:46.302 --> 20:48.068
Mallory: Hello? Hello?
Emergency services.

20:48.103 --> 20:49.069
Ty: Hey guys, what's up?

20:49.104 --> 20:50.438
Well, Katie swallowed a penny.

20:50.505 --> 20:51.772
Tim: So make a hole, we
gotta get to the hospital.

20:51.806 --> 20:53.005
Whoa, whoa. Is she breathing?

20:53.040 --> 20:54.241
She looks fine.

20:54.275 --> 20:55.875
Tim:
She swallowed a penny, Jack.

20:55.909 --> 20:57.210
Jack:
Mallory, tell them to hurry.

20:57.245 --> 20:58.678
Ty: This happened to a
beagle at the clinic once.

20:58.713 --> 21:01.648
If she's not choking, then the
best thing to do is just wait.

21:01.682 --> 21:05.184
Well, thank you, Dr. borden,
except wait, you're not a doctor.

21:05.219 --> 21:08.054
You're not even a med student,
you're a vet student.

21:08.088 --> 21:09.588
<i>So move, we're leaving!</i>

21:09.623 --> 21:10.889
Tim!

21:10.957 --> 21:13.125
She swallowed a penny;
There's only one way out.

21:13.159 --> 21:14.926
Wait, stop! Ty's right.

21:14.961 --> 21:16.629
Emergency services concurs.

21:16.663 --> 21:19.398
If there's no obstruction,
let nature take its course.

21:19.432 --> 21:20.733
Jack: Well, that's a relief.
Ty: Thank you.

21:20.800 --> 21:21.634
Thank you.

21:21.668 --> 21:22.668
Hmm.

21:22.736 --> 21:23.669
<i>Tim: It's okay, we'll wait.</i>

21:23.737 --> 21:25.737
Lou: Good dog. Move 'em up!

21:25.771 --> 21:26.704
Amy: Keep on movin'!

21:26.739 --> 21:29.307
<i>Georgie: Move up, sheep!</i>

21:30.309 --> 21:32.577
<i>Come on! This way!</i>

21:32.645 --> 21:34.245
<i>Amy: Good goin', Georgie!</i>

21:34.313 --> 21:36.614
[Dog barks, sheep bleat]

21:36.682 --> 21:39.016
Nicole: Whoa! Easy, easy.

21:39.084 --> 21:40.251
[Bleating]

21:40.318 --> 21:41.685
Lou: Are you okay there?

21:41.753 --> 21:45.054
Nicole: Uh, I don't know.
Georgie: This way!

21:45.122 --> 21:46.690
Nicole: Whoa, stop.

21:46.758 --> 21:49.192
Lou: All right, loosen up on the
reins and stop kicking him.

21:49.260 --> 21:50.761
Well, he's not stopping.

21:50.828 --> 21:52.462
Hey, whoa! What's he doing?

21:52.497 --> 21:54.798
Lou: You know what? Amy and Georgie
have the sheep under control...

21:54.832 --> 21:56.499
<i>Nicole: Okay, whoa! Whoa!</i>

21:56.533 --> 21:58.867
Lou: Why don't we just take
a breather, lean back,

21:58.902 --> 21:59.935
and let the horses
calm down a little.

22:00.003 --> 22:03.272
Nicole:
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

22:03.340 --> 22:05.408
Easy! Whoa.

22:05.475 --> 22:07.576
Lou: I got him, I got him.

22:07.644 --> 22:09.779
All right, you good? Hop off.

22:09.846 --> 22:12.047
Nicole: Oh! Thank God.

22:12.115 --> 22:13.448
Lou: Are you okay?

22:13.482 --> 22:16.083
Yeah, I'm going to be
walking funny for about a week.

22:16.151 --> 22:18.453
You're doing great.

22:18.521 --> 22:20.254
You know, at least you can
tell everyone at work

22:20.323 --> 22:22.757
that you went on
a real sheep drive.

22:22.825 --> 22:24.426
Maybe you could even
mention it to your boss,

22:24.493 --> 22:25.627
you know, tell her
how great it would be

22:25.661 --> 22:26.894
for all your coworkers
to come out here.

22:26.962 --> 22:30.230
Yeah, Lou, it's great, except
I'm not going back to work.

22:30.298 --> 22:31.432
What?

22:31.499 --> 22:34.301
I don't have a job
to go back to.

22:37.806 --> 22:39.640
That's it, honey, concentrate.

22:39.708 --> 22:40.674
[Katie moans]

22:40.742 --> 22:42.909
Come on, honey, you can do it.

22:42.944 --> 22:45.211
You know, I'm surprised you two aren't
out with Amy and Lou, right now.

22:45.278 --> 22:47.780
What are you talkin' about?

22:47.848 --> 22:49.014
You don't know?

22:49.082 --> 22:50.383
They're moving the sheep
out to the lease land.

22:50.451 --> 22:52.485
They're probably in the
foothills right about now.

22:52.519 --> 22:54.487
I knew they were up
to something.

22:54.555 --> 22:56.456
Mallory: Wow, that sounds
pretty bad, you guys,

22:56.523 --> 22:59.191
just leaving the girls
to do all the work?

22:59.226 --> 23:01.926
Yeah, I thought
they were your sheep?

23:01.961 --> 23:05.330
Well, if I'd have known, I'd
have done something about it.

23:05.365 --> 23:07.399
Well, you might still
have a chance.

23:07.433 --> 23:09.300
Amy's great with horses,
but I don't know about sheep.

23:09.335 --> 23:11.069
She might not even make it
there with them.

23:11.103 --> 23:12.537
So where are you going now?

23:12.605 --> 23:16.674
It's okay, Jack, you just rest
easy and I'll handle this.

23:22.146 --> 23:24.314
Can you handle Katie
for a couple hours?

23:24.349 --> 23:25.282
Yeah, I can watch her.

23:25.350 --> 23:26.950
Good.

23:26.985 --> 23:28.586
Okay.

23:30.154 --> 23:32.489
<i>Lou: So you lost your license?</i>

23:32.523 --> 23:34.257
Well, it's been
temporarily revoked,

23:34.291 --> 23:38.795
and I've been suspended pending the
results of an investigation by the sec.

23:38.829 --> 23:40.663
And what exactly
are they investigating?

23:40.698 --> 23:42.766
You know, the usual,
cooking the books,

23:42.800 --> 23:44.901
insider trading,
pump and dump schemes.

23:44.935 --> 23:47.804
But you weren't involved with
any of that, I mean, were you?

23:47.838 --> 23:50.972
Of course not,
but I heard rumours,

23:51.007 --> 23:53.675
enough so that I probably should
have known that they were true.

23:53.710 --> 23:55.611
And just knowing about it
makes you a criminal?

23:55.645 --> 23:58.313
No. Knowing about it and not
doing anything to stop it

23:58.347 --> 24:00.649
makes me guilty by omission.

24:00.683 --> 24:05.486
And that's kinda why I'm here, Lou, to
just sort of prep me for my appearance

24:05.554 --> 24:08.222
before the commission.

24:08.256 --> 24:11.191
The problem is,
if I tell the truth,

24:11.226 --> 24:15.430
I'll never work in
the financial industry again.

24:16.665 --> 24:17.998
[Trunk rumbles]

24:18.867 --> 24:20.434
Where do you think
you're going?

24:20.468 --> 24:22.335
Amy and Lou need help.

24:22.369 --> 24:25.138
I figure I'm the best man
for the job.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.205
Yeah? [Slams door]

24:26.240 --> 24:28.508
Well, we'll see about that.

24:28.543 --> 24:30.610
What do you mean,
"maybe next week"?

24:30.645 --> 24:33.980
Man: Excuse me, miss!
Mallory: I need it today!

24:34.014 --> 24:36.982
It's the same order as always.

24:37.050 --> 24:40.619
Okay. Okay, Thursday.
Wonderful.

24:40.654 --> 24:42.688
See you then.
[Phone beeps off]

24:42.756 --> 24:44.156
Bad news?

24:44.223 --> 24:46.792
I don't know
what I'm doing here, Ty.

24:46.860 --> 24:50.596
I had all these options, but
I couldn't make up my mind

24:50.630 --> 24:52.397
so I picked the safe route.

24:52.465 --> 24:57.635
Now I'm stuck here doing the same
thing I've been doing for years.

24:57.703 --> 24:59.771
Well, if you don't want the job,
why don't you just talk to Lou?

24:59.839 --> 25:01.172
And say what?

25:01.239 --> 25:04.642
Thanks for promoting me,
I quit.

25:04.710 --> 25:06.845
No, those aren't the words
that I would use.

25:06.912 --> 25:08.379
It's all Jake's fault.

25:08.447 --> 25:15.285
I mean him going to Paris to work
at a wild west show is amazing

25:15.319 --> 25:18.689
in comparison
to working at Maggie's.

25:18.723 --> 25:22.693
So you and Jake,
after all these years.

25:22.760 --> 25:24.760
You think I like Jake?

25:25.696 --> 25:28.430
Are you kidding?
That's ridiculous.

25:28.499 --> 25:29.665
Yeah, sure.

25:31.568 --> 25:33.335
Everybody used to think
it was the cutest thing -

25:33.403 --> 25:36.038
the little cowboy
with the big crush on mallory

25:36.106 --> 25:38.841
and the way you'd pretend
like you weren't interested.

25:38.909 --> 25:40.976
You guys aren't kids anymore.

25:41.043 --> 25:45.013
Maybe it's time you tell him how you
really feel, one way or the other.

25:46.115 --> 25:49.150
That would be easier
if I knew how I felt.

25:51.020 --> 25:52.654
Amy: Come on! Let's go!

25:52.722 --> 25:53.655
Georgie: Come on!

25:53.723 --> 25:55.089
Amy: [Whistles] Come on!

25:55.157 --> 25:56.224
Georgie: Move it!

25:56.258 --> 25:58.526
Come on, sheep! Go!

25:59.494 --> 26:01.261
[Bleating]

26:01.329 --> 26:03.330
Good job, Georgie.

26:03.398 --> 26:05.298
Just keep 'em from heading off
in the trees.

26:05.333 --> 26:08.002
Georgie: Okay. [Clicks
tongue] Come on, copper.

26:08.036 --> 26:10.004
Lou: Amy! Amy: Hey, Lou!

26:10.071 --> 26:11.138
Lou:
What do you want us to do?

26:11.205 --> 26:12.605
Amy:
Just help keep drivin' 'em.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.440
Lou: All right. Come on, sheep!

26:14.474 --> 26:15.942
Let's move them up here,

Whoa! What's...
What's going on?

26:32.759 --> 26:34.993
It's dad. Dad, no!

27:05.489 --> 27:07.824
I'm so sorry. Oh...

27:07.858 --> 27:09.325
Amy: Dad, what did you
think you were doing?

27:09.359 --> 27:11.895
Well, I don't know about Jack, but I'm
here to help you with these sheep.

27:11.929 --> 27:13.930
Well, you guys are doing
a great job so far.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.966
Jack: Well, maybe if you'd asked
before setting out like this.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.635
I did ask, and you guys didn't
seem too concerned about it.

27:19.669 --> 27:21.937
Tim: All right, all right,
everybody just calm down.

27:21.972 --> 27:25.040
We'll work together and we'll get
the sheep up to the lease land.

27:25.075 --> 27:26.308
Lou: You know what? I
have a better idea.

27:26.342 --> 27:29.979
How about you two
deal with it yourselves.

27:30.013 --> 27:31.814
[Bleating]

27:31.848 --> 27:33.681
Are you okay
to get back on your horse?

27:33.749 --> 27:35.583
Nicole: I don't know.

27:35.651 --> 27:37.184
Come on, it's all right.

27:37.219 --> 27:38.686
We'll be there the whole time.

on, sheep, let's go!</i>

27:41.657 --> 27:42.690
Okay.

27:43.692 --> 27:46.060
Yeah, okay, I can do it.
All right.

27:47.496 --> 27:48.629
Lou: I'll give you a
leg up, if you want.

27:48.663 --> 27:51.798
You know what?
I think I got it.

27:51.833 --> 27:53.166
All right.

Okay, next stop, a hot bath
and a cold Pinot grigio.

28:04.311 --> 28:05.645
[Chuckles] Yeah.

28:09.349 --> 28:10.716
Where's Katie?

<i>You were supposed to be</i>
<i>looking after her.</i>

28:12.519 --> 28:13.919
Everything's fine.

28:13.954 --> 28:16.989
Katie's with Ty, at Maggie's.

28:17.057 --> 28:20.992
Yeah, and it turns out it's
perfectly fine to swallow a penny.

28:21.060 --> 28:22.961
She swallowed a penny?

28:23.029 --> 28:24.495
Yeah, Tim's penny.

28:25.464 --> 28:26.765
I don't believe you guys.

<i>Okay, you know what?</i>
<i>I need to get out of here</i>

to kill somebody.

Hey, Jake,
I'm just closing up.

28:54.424 --> 28:57.026
Yeah, I was wondering
if you'd like a ride home?

28:57.094 --> 28:58.661
You know I have a car, right?

28:58.729 --> 29:02.464
The one parked
right across the street?

29:02.532 --> 29:06.069
Oh yeah, of course.
So... never mind.

29:08.405 --> 29:14.836
- Come on, Jake, what's going on?
- I guess I was hoping that

29:14.944 --> 29:17.112
even if Lou gave you
the job at Maggie's,

29:17.180 --> 29:21.883
you would consider maybe
going to France.

You mean, with you?

29:24.920 --> 29:26.386
Well...

Maybe, yeah..

29:29.992 --> 29:30.925
Meet in Paris,

29:30.992 --> 29:32.927
go visit soraya in London...

29:32.994 --> 29:34.294
Whatever.

29:35.630 --> 29:38.365
I really wish
you would've asked earlier.

29:38.399 --> 29:40.667
I know, I should have.
