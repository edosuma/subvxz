<i>December 20th
is the worst day of the year</i>

00:33.616 --> 00:36.494
<i>to travel through
John F. Kennedy International Airport.</i>

00:36.578 --> 00:40.415
<i>Over 193,000 passengers
arrive and depart that day...</i>

00:41.458 --> 00:43.626
<i>...causing, on average,
23-minute delays at check-in</i>

00:43.710 --> 00:46.921
<i>and a peak wait time
of 117 minutes at security.</i>

00:47.964 --> 00:50.842

on this inconvenient day...</i>

00:50.925 --> 00:51.965
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.471
<i>...it is the story of only one that matters.</i>

00:54.554 --> 00:57.223
<i>Because today, that passenger is late.</i>

00:57.307 --> 00:58.516
Excuse me.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.269
- Whoa, whoa.
- Oh. Sorry. Sorry!

Wait! Please, I'm here.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.402
Uh, sorry, miss. You're too late.

01:35.553 --> 01:38.306
<i>Or you might prefer to think
that everything happens for a reason.</i>

01:38.389 --> 01:41.434

won't be unlucky at all.</i>

01:41.518 --> 01:44.813

a girl and a boy will meet,

01:45.355 --> 01:47.482

01:50.235 --> 01:53.738
But just to be clear,
this isn't a story about love.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.616
This is a story about fate.

01:57.992 --> 01:58.993
Or statistics.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.955
Really just depends
on who you're talking to.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.668
<i>The girl
is Hadley Ella Sullivan.</i>

02:06.751 --> 02:08.794

02:08.877 --> 02:11.840
<i>She's late 21% of the time,

02:11.923 --> 02:13.800
<i>the average battery life

02:13.883 --> 02:15.552
<i>She's afraid of three things,</i>

02:20.890 --> 02:23.685
<i>There was one thing, however,
she never thought to be afraid of.</i>

02:23.768 --> 02:24.811
It's just for a term.

02:24.894 --> 02:28.815
Dad, you're literally gonna be teaching
poetry in the country Shakespeare's from.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.901
- How are you not freaking out right now?
- Oh, I'm freakin' out.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.362
This is awesome.
I've always wanted to study abroad...

02:34.445 --> 02:38.491
Actually, honey,
you and I are staying here.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.285
Why?

02:40.869 --> 02:44.122
<i>She wasn't ready to admit it,
but on her list of fears,</i>

02:44.205 --> 02:47.667
<i>divorce suddenly ranked
much higher than mayonnaise.</i>

02:48.710 --> 02:51.880
The best thing we can do
is get you on the next flight.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.507
There are two seats left,
both in business.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.926
- When does that leave?
- Hour and a half.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.095
Arrives in London at 9:55 a.m.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.056
- My dad's wedding's at noon.
- Do you need to think about it?

03:03.391 --> 03:05.768
You know, can you give me one second?
I'll just be...

03:05.852 --> 03:07.103
Sorry, just one second.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.564
Just, uh...

03:15.486 --> 03:17.280
Hey, sweetie. What's up?

03:17.363 --> 03:19.699
- Hey, I, uh, missed my flight.
- What?

03:19.782 --> 03:22.493
Yeah, I can get on the next one,
but there's only business.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.737
It doesn't get in till 10:00.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.121
Tomorrow?

03:25.705 --> 03:28.458
- No, tonight. I'll be traveling by comet.
<i>- Hadley.</i>

03:28.541 --> 03:29.584
<i>Sorry.</i>

03:29.667 --> 03:33.087
All right, well, buy the ticket,
and... and I'll reimburse you.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.882
- Uh, no, I can pay for it.
- Don't be ridiculous.

03:35.965 --> 03:38.301
- You can't afford that.
<i>- Okay. Thank you.</i>

03:38.885 --> 03:40.220
I really have to go.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.346
<i>All right.</i>

03:41.429 --> 03:43.723
Well, text me right when you land, okay?

03:43.806 --> 03:44.891
Yeah, okay.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.601
- Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

03:49.395 --> 03:50.271
Okay, yeah.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.523
One business-class ticket
to London, please.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.944
Thank you. Thanks.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.445
Sorry.

<i>If you see something, say something.</i>

04:08.164 --> 04:09.874
Oh. It's dead.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.125
So that's why it's open.

04:12.710 --> 04:13.795
Course it is.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.422
- What?
- Um...

04:16.505 --> 04:18.382
Never mind. Nothing. Thank you.

04:33.398 --> 04:37.235

<i>on</i> his <i>mobile phone.</i>

04:43.283 --> 04:45.743

04:45.827 --> 04:47.704
<i>germs, the dark...</i>

04:48.705 --> 04:49.705
<i>...and surprises.</i>

04:51.874 --> 04:53.042
Here is the scroll...

04:53.126 --> 04:54.002
The scroll?

04:54.085 --> 05:00.133
...on which is writ
every man's name that is thought fit

05:00.216 --> 05:01.216
in all...

05:04.304 --> 05:06.064
At the moment,
it's still localized.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.534
With the right course of treatment,
her chances are very good.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.643
These things aren't always predictable.

05:10.727 --> 05:15.023
<i>It was then that Oliver decided
he'd never be surprised like that again.</i>

05:15.106 --> 05:17.734
Everything in our lives
is now measured by big data.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.112
Our social connections,
our buying habits, even our daily steps.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.364
That means that eventually, one day,

05:23.448 --> 05:25.325
everything in our lives
will be predictable.

05:25.408 --> 05:28.369
I think there's always some things
that will catch us by surprise.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.997
Not if we have enough data.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.970
<i>When you're afraid
of surprises,</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:36.294
<i>it can seem better
to leave nothing to chance.</i>

05:37.462 --> 05:38.463
Borrow mine, if you want.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.424

<i>with a dead phone battery.</i>

05:49.599 --> 05:51.851
Okay. No, I...
I suppose it <i>is</i> quite intimate.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.688
Mm-hmm.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.983
Yeah, I'm done, if you wanna use it.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.235
Oh, uh... thanks. I...

06:02.111 --> 06:03.029
Battery keeps dying.

06:03.112 --> 06:05.031
It probably just needs a service.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.784
Phone batteries, they have
a finite number of charging cycles.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.869
You, like, a tech bro, or...

06:09.952 --> 06:11.412
A maths geek.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.748
I'm studying statistics at Yale.

06:14.707 --> 06:15.707
Wow.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.836
Subtle status drop there.

06:20.296 --> 06:23.049
British, you know? Can't help myself.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.428
I'm Oliver, by the way.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.721
As in Twist?

06:30.431 --> 06:32.517
And they say Americans are uncultured.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.187
Oh. We definitely are.
I'm just a Dickens fan.

06:36.938 --> 06:37.772
I'm Hadley.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.273
Well, it's nice to meet you.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.067
Nice to meet you.

06:43.152 --> 06:45.279
What are you studying, Dickens fan Hadley?

06:46.030 --> 06:49.450
- English lit?
- I'm...  ...undecided.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.494
It's not like I woke up one morning
and was like,

06:51.577 --> 06:53.704
"Oh, I'm gonna be
a tax law attorney."

06:53.788 --> 06:55.665
Does that happen to anyone?

06:55.748 --> 06:57.625
Tax attorneys, probably.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.046
Where are you headed?

07:02.964 --> 07:04.298
Uh, London. You?

07:05.049 --> 07:06.676
Same. Yeah, I'm actually, uh...

07:06.759 --> 07:09.303
...I'm supposed to be
in the air currently.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.639
- But I missed my flight by four minutes.
- Ooh.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.600
I... I'd say it was fate,

07:14.684 --> 07:16.936
but you probably <i>chose</i>
to be four minutes late.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.105
Hmm.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.403
I was gonna go get some food.

07:25.486 --> 07:26.654
Do you wanna come with?

07:27.321 --> 07:30.616
Is that, like,
a... third date thing for you?

07:32.493 --> 07:34.829
No, food would be great.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.958
<i>Ordinarily, Hadley's
perpetual tardiness and uncharged phone</i>

07:39.041 --> 07:40.334
<i>led her to get into trouble.</i>

07:40.835 --> 07:43.379
<i>Today, it led her to Oliver.</i>

07:43.463 --> 07:45.590
Are you heading home
for the holidays?

07:45.673 --> 07:47.550
I assume that London is your home.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.899
Yeah. To be honest, I'd rather stay here.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.637
Don't wanna get behind on my research.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.014
What are you researching?

07:53.097 --> 07:55.391
The percentage of Americans
who miss their flights.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.351
Hmm.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.978
Hilarious. Very funny.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.105
Oh. Ew.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.149
- That's nasty.
- Ah.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.568
I've got a Lysol wipe for you.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.862
For your dirty, dying phone.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.406
Thank you.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.783
I've always, uh, hated airports.

08:12.867 --> 08:13.701
Really?

08:13.784 --> 08:14.994
I love 'em.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.078
Why?

08:16.162 --> 08:18.831
I like how you're neither here
nor there, you're just

08:20.249 --> 08:21.334
in no-man's-land.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.877
No, it sounds lovely.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.961
Just like purgatory.

08:27.632 --> 08:28.632
Not a carbs guy?

08:29.050 --> 08:30.968
No, I just... I just hate mayonnaise.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.053
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.722
- It's a disgusting condiment...
- I hate it too, actually.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.140
Um, it's, uh,

08:37.850 --> 08:39.644
number two of my top three fears.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.270
- What are the others?
- Dentists and small spaces.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.022
- You've thought about this.
- Not really.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.901
Like, if I were to ask
what you're afraid of,

08:46.984 --> 08:48.736
you wouldn't have to think.
You would know.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.446
Well, how do you know I'm not fearless?

08:50.530 --> 08:53.491
'Cause you are eating deli meat
with a fork and knife.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.789
Sorry, I gotta take this.

08:59.872 --> 09:00.915
Oh yeah. Go for it.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.002
<i>You did say 11:00
you were getting in?</i>

09:05.086 --> 09:07.213
No, it's 10:00. I emailed you.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.464
You did?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.716
I blame the gym's Wi-Fi. It's a bit dodgy.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.261
<i>You've got one job tomorrow.
Pick me up at 10:00.</i>

09:13.344 --> 09:14.424
Don't worry. I'll be there.

09:14.470 --> 09:18.266
And by the way, I've got a little surprise
planned for you, so... be ready for that.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.142
What? No, I don't like surprises.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.978
It's a good one. You can't be annoyed.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.063
I've warned you,
so you can't be as pissed.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.226
What kind of logic is that?

09:25.815 --> 09:26.732
<i>Luther, no.</i>

09:26.816 --> 09:29.652
<i>I don't want a surprise.
You think they're all good. None are good.</i>

09:29.735 --> 09:32.071
No, sorry, Wi-Fi's breaking up.
No, I can't hear you.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.906
Luth. Luther!

09:42.957 --> 09:44.917
- Sorry about that.
- Okay.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.754
So if claustrophobia
is one of your biggest fears,

09:48.838 --> 09:51.299
then why are you about
to embark on a seven-hour flight?

09:51.382 --> 09:52.902
That <i>is</i> a very good question.

09:52.967 --> 09:53.967
A wedding.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.262
Same as you?

09:57.096 --> 09:58.139
Right.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.017
That is actually my loungewear.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.185
So I like to relax
in a finely pressed suit.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.353
Hey, I get it.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.105
Wrinkles are stressful.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.608
<i>...to London Heathrow...</i>

10:08.691 --> 10:10.151
Did he just call our flight?

10:10.735 --> 10:12.528
- Already?
- Um, uh...

10:12.612 --> 10:15.698
Shoot, I can't miss another one. So...

10:15.781 --> 10:17.821
Oh. This way.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.970
- Backpack. Thank you!
- I'll get it.

Oh!

11:14.840 --> 11:15.840
Very nice.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.510
I'm further back, so...

11:17.593 --> 11:19.845
Hello, madam.
May I help you find your seat?

11:19.929 --> 11:21.972
- I'm right here. I'm good, thanks.
- Okay.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.349
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

11:23.432 --> 11:24.433
Thank you.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.811
- Let me get that for you.
- Oh. Thank you.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.189
Sorry.

11:31.899 --> 11:34.235
Back to the gym.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.569
Um, sorry. One sec.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.447
Um, it's, uh, lovely to meet you, Hadley.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.531
Yeah.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.534
- Good luck.
- You too.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.871
"Good luck"?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.289
What a knob.

12:08.519 --> 12:09.854
- Evening.
- All right, mate.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.501
Uh, excuse me, miss.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.464
- Yes, sir?
- I think my seat belt is broken.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.007
Oh. May I?

12:38.632 --> 12:39.467
Oh. Nope.

12:39.550 --> 12:40.550
Stay.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.347
You're right. Oh dear.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.432
What?

12:46.515 --> 12:48.392
You can't fly without a working seat belt.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.643
I have to be on this flight.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.414
- It's a safety issue.
- Is there somewhere else I can sit?

12:52.438 --> 12:54.118
I'll strap myself into cargo if I have to.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.734
Sit tight, lovely.
I'll see if we can move you.

12:56.817 --> 12:57.817
Thank you.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.238
Mom, hi. I missed my flight.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.365
But I got on the next one,
so everything's fine.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.118
Um, I'll call you when I land.
Okay? I love you. Bye.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.580
- Thank you for this.
- It's nothing.

13:09.663 --> 13:12.958
Look, technically we're not supposed
to move from economy to business,

13:13.042 --> 13:14.042
but, um,

13:14.835 --> 13:16.504
today just happens to be your lucky day.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.089
Hadley.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.173
Oliver.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.552
- What are you...
- My seat belt's broken.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.476
- They have to move me.
- I'm sorry.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.223
Do you two know each other?

13:27.306 --> 13:29.016
- Yeah...
- Sort of, um...

13:30.267 --> 13:32.394
Then I guess
this really <i>is</i> your lucky day.

13:34.522 --> 13:35.981
Well, this is unexpected.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.527
I would've thought you'd seen it coming,
Mr. Predictive Analytics.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.988
All right, okay. Very good.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.990
Well done.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.826
- Hmm.
- Do you always get pj's?

13:46.909 --> 13:49.495
I've actually
never flown business either.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.123
Do you mind if I...

13:53.624 --> 13:54.984
- Oh, thank you.
- Wipe you down...

13:55.042 --> 13:57.169
Uh, not, uh, like that.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.755
29% of airplanes
are not cleaned thoroughly.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.675
I... I made that one up.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.434
Over the next 6 hours and 47 minutes,

14:12.518 --> 14:15.271
Hadley Sullivan
and Oliver Jones will fall in love.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.485
But then, 18 minutes after they land,

14:21.569 --> 14:24.697
they'll be separated in a crowd
and never see each other again.

14:25.823 --> 14:30.411
Well, that's unless they get each other's
name or number or email,

14:30.494 --> 14:32.663
Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.708
There's loads of options, really.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.044
Great.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.319
{\an8}<i>In case of an emergency landing in water,</i>

14:46.343 --> 14:48.762

14:48.846 --> 14:50.514
<i>and will inflate automatically.</i>

14:50.598 --> 14:53.225
<i>It has a whistle
for you to use for attention</i>

14:53.309 --> 14:55.477
<i>and a light

14:56.270 --> 14:57.270
What?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.370
I've never seen anyone read those before.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.609
Well, then you're very lucky
to be sitting next to me.

15:01.692 --> 15:02.735
Oh. You mean in general?

15:03.611 --> 15:05.029
And in case of an emergency.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.406
Right, 'cause if we crash-land
into the pond,

15:07.489 --> 15:10.034
then all five-foot-nothing of you

15:10.117 --> 15:12.328
is gonna pick me up
and carry me out of there.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.538
You know the chances
of this plane crashing are, like,

15:14.622 --> 15:16.165
one in five and a half million.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.465
You're more likely to die
on your ride home...

15:18.542 --> 15:20.127
Can we not talk about dying right now?

15:21.712 --> 15:23.005
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.384
<i>Cabin crew, prepare for takeoff.</i>

15:57.414 --> 15:58.414
You okay?

15:59.208 --> 16:00.250
Mm-hmm.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.256
Um, what's your... favorite color?

16:07.758 --> 16:08.758
Food?

16:09.093 --> 16:10.386
Animal?

16:11.595 --> 16:13.389
Seriously?

16:13.472 --> 16:14.472
Come on.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.852
Yellow, Mexican, dogs. You?

16:19.603 --> 16:21.647
Blue, curry, and birds.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.107
Birds.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.191
Ew.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.652
What do you mean, "Ew"?
They're the symbol of freedom.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.861
They shit everywhere.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.571
So do dogs.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.823
Dogs aren't creepy.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.575
Okay. What's your favorite number?

16:33.659 --> 16:35.661
Um... two.

16:35.744 --> 16:36.578
You?

16:36.662 --> 16:37.662
<i>i.</i>

16:39.581 --> 16:40.916
It's the imaginary unit.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.168
It's the square root of negative one.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.338
- Wow. You're such a nerd.
- I know.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.924
Maybe. But I think it's working.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.552
What, you being charming?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.263
No. Me distracting you.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.019
It's good to know
that you think I'm charming, though.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.502
<i>The captain
has switched off the seat belt light,</i>

17:07.526 --> 17:09.778
<i>so please feel free
to move around the cabin.</i>

17:09.862 --> 17:10.945
<i>In a few moments,</i>

17:11.030 --> 17:12.869
<i>the flight attendants
will be passing around...</i>

17:12.906 --> 17:13.906
Thank you for that.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.367
No worries.

17:16.743 --> 17:17.994
I'll get that for you.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.372
- Oh, thank you, young man.
- That's okay.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.376
- You got a good one there.
- Thanks.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.752
How'd you two meet?

17:25.836 --> 17:29.214
- Actually, we...
- It was at an airport, believe it or not.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.424
Really?

17:30.507 --> 17:32.718
Yeah. See, um, her phone was dead,

17:32.801 --> 17:35.596
so I gallantly offered her my charger.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.598
We started chatting.

17:37.681 --> 17:38.849
One thing led to another...

17:38.932 --> 17:41.310
And he's been charging
my batteries ever since.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.728
Oh, good for you two.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.523
Anyway, have a nice flight.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.608
You too.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.736
So, tell me more about this wedding.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.489
Oh, yeah, uh...

17:54.031 --> 17:55.031
Yeah, um...

17:55.741 --> 17:59.536
It's my dad's second marriage

17:59.620 --> 18:01.205
to a woman I've never met before.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.539
So...

18:03.582 --> 18:05.542
- So you're going to your dad's wedding.
- Yep.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.753
And you've never met his fiancée.

18:07.836 --> 18:09.171
- Nope.
- How does that work?

18:11.381 --> 18:12.382
Well...

18:12.466 --> 18:18.305
Um, it starts when he gets
a job teaching poetry at Oxford.

18:18.388 --> 18:21.100
Then after promising
that that will only last for a semester,

18:21.183 --> 18:24.436
he files for divorce from your mom

18:24.520 --> 18:27.523
and falls in love
with a woman named Charlotte

18:27.606 --> 18:30.109
and proceeds to ask her to marry him.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.570
And then he makes you,
who he hasn't seen for over a year,

18:33.654 --> 18:36.490
fly across the ocean in a tin can

18:36.573 --> 18:39.868
so you can stand next to him
wearing a dress the color of a bruise.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.286
That's awful.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.539
Yeah.

18:43.622 --> 18:48.168
If it's, uh, any consolation,
50% of marriages do end in divorce.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.129
That means 50% don't.

18:50.212 --> 18:54.591
Yeah, but I mean, the chances
of this happening were incredibly high.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.395
Is that supposed
to make me feel any better?

18:56.468 --> 18:57.886
- Doesn't it?
- No.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.471
I think it just sucks.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.974
You know, the worst part is that

19:02.975 --> 19:04.643
he's gonna get up tomorrow,

19:04.726 --> 19:06.406
and he's gonna make
the exact same promises

19:06.478 --> 19:07.479
that he just broke.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.023
I get that people can fall in love again.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.347
I just feel like, if it's real,

19:11.400 --> 19:13.152
why do you have to try
so hard to prove it?

19:13.235 --> 19:18.615
Why do you have to throw this big,
grand party to rub it in everyone's face?

19:19.449 --> 19:22.244
I think that real love isn't about that.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.414
Real love is about finding someone

19:26.206 --> 19:28.625
that will hold your hand
when life gets rough.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.501
And that's it?

19:31.420 --> 19:36.008
No wedding, no marriage, just...
someone to hold your hand through life?

19:37.759 --> 19:38.759
Yeah, pretty much.

19:42.681 --> 19:46.018
I like that...
weddings are a promise, I guess.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.189
Not everyone keeps their promises.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.067
Anyways,

19:55.027 --> 19:56.820
that's my wedding.

19:56.904 --> 19:57.904
What's yours?

19:57.946 --> 20:01.283
Please say something dramatic,
like your stepmom's marrying your uncle

20:01.366 --> 20:02.618
or something like that.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.037
- Um...
- So what'll it be?

20:05.120 --> 20:09.041
Some delicious chicken and vegetables,
or some... very dry fish?

20:09.625 --> 20:10.709
- Chicken.
- Mm.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.127
- Right.
- Um...

20:12.211 --> 20:14.379
I'm gonna go for the fish...

20:16.173 --> 20:17.007
Chicken.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.425
Excellent choice, madam.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.929
- Wow, our second dinner date.
- Hmm.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.805
Things are moving fast.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.149
For you.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.086
All right?

20:54.169 --> 20:55.420
Yeah. Sorry, I...

20:56.296 --> 20:57.339
Oh my God.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.300
- I mean...
- Sexy, I know.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.636
- Perfect fit.
- I thought so.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.012
Look cute.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.182
Oh, you weren't lying about Dickens.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.267
Oh, um...

21:08.892 --> 21:11.228
...I actually haven't read this one.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.081
- Hmm. Looks like someone has.
- Yeah.

21:13.105 --> 21:17.150
Um, it was my dad's.
He gave it to me after the divorce.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.278
It was a thing that we would do.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.281
He would give me books he loved,
and then I would love them too.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.326
It's one of his best ones.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.328
I've read it... at least a dozen times.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.915
You know, I don't get to recommend books
as often to you now.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.752
But certain ones are too important
to get lost in all this.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.796
Thanks.

21:39.214 --> 21:41.008
So, should we hit the slopes?

21:44.011 --> 21:46.888
Yeah. Um, just gotta pee first.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.860
"'Is it better
to have had a good thing and lost it,

22:00.360 --> 22:01.737
or never to have had it?'"

22:07.784 --> 22:09.369
<i>That's why I'm giving it back.</i>

22:09.911 --> 22:11.621
Without having read it.

22:11.705 --> 22:12.873
Without having read it.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.417
Right.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.840
Do you wanna join me
at the cinema?

22:21.923 --> 22:25.177
Make our first date dinner
and a nice, cheesy rom-com?

22:26.595 --> 22:28.096
I'm down for a cheesy rom-com.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.350
As long as there's a happy ending.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.434
You know what I meant.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.062
Okay.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.646
- I meant like...
- No. No, it's fine.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.374
- In the movie with the characters...
- Hey.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.442
I like happy endings.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.643
<i>Oh, let us come to the gate.</i>

23:14.726 --> 23:16.520
- Let us come with you.
- Mom, I'm 21.

23:16.603 --> 23:17.896
- Just come to the...
- No!

23:17.979 --> 23:19.147
Okay, well, work hard,

23:19.231 --> 23:21.358
but... don't forget to play.

23:21.441 --> 23:22.275
I will.

23:22.359 --> 23:24.712
- And make sure you eat... properly.
- Same to you.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.488
I'm so proud of you.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.407
Okay. Go.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.490
Go on then.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.200
Live your life.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.370
Have a grand adventure!

23:33.870 --> 23:35.372
Farewell!

23:35.455 --> 23:36.498
Toodle-oo.

23:36.581 --> 23:38.083
Bye!

23:56.226 --> 23:57.602
Are you preparing a speech?

23:59.062 --> 24:00.062
Yeah.

24:00.897 --> 24:01.940
Best man?

24:03.233 --> 24:05.444
That's what they tell me.

24:06.403 --> 24:07.612
You get some rest?

24:07.696 --> 24:08.696
Little bit.

24:11.158 --> 24:14.661
I was thinking about it, and...
I don't think you should give it back.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.287
The book.

24:16.705 --> 24:17.705
Why not?

24:18.832 --> 24:21.877
Well, historically,
you and your dad were very close,

24:21.960 --> 24:25.839
which means the odds are
you will eventually forgive him.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.925
So you might as well just do it now.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.678
You and the math thing.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.180
Mm.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.974
Yeah, drives my brother nuts too.

24:36.057 --> 24:37.392
You have siblings?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.144
Uh, yeah, one.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.313
He's two years younger. Luther.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.190
Does he live in London?

24:43.273 --> 24:44.774
Yeah, with our mum and dad.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.276
Well, until a few months ago

24:46.359 --> 24:49.696
when he decided to buy
a garish green Sprinter van.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.698
Hmm. Those are cool.

24:51.781 --> 24:52.781
Mm.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.202
That's what he tells me.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.829
Are you guys close, historically?

25:01.041 --> 25:03.543
- You ask a lot of questions, don't you?
- Are you?

25:05.921 --> 25:07.506
Our mum got sick when we were kids.

25:08.256 --> 25:10.634
So, yeah. But we're both very different.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.803
It's fine, though. I'm used to it now.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.265
She okay now, your mom?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.936
Uh, she was in remission
for 14 years, but it came back.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.146
I'm sorry.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.775
Oh no...

25:36.576 --> 25:38.703
You're sort of dangerous.
Do you know that?

25:39.663 --> 25:40.663
Me?

25:44.376 --> 25:45.376
Yeah.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.629
I'm way too honest with you.

25:53.885 --> 25:58.557
Anyway, I should nip to the loo
and then get some sleep, I think.

Morning.

28:07.769 --> 28:08.769
Morning.

28:10.730 --> 28:11.916
- I was going...
- I feel like...

28:11.940 --> 28:13.066
- Sorry, you...
- No.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.484
No, you.

28:15.402 --> 28:18.530
Uh, I was just gonna ask if, um...

28:20.115 --> 28:22.409
This wedding of yours, where is it?

28:23.034 --> 28:24.285
Oh, um...

28:25.120 --> 28:26.246
Um...

28:26.913 --> 28:28.707
Shoreditch, I think?

28:28.790 --> 28:31.459
Shoreditch, yeah.
That's very cool. Very hipster.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.461
What about you? Where do you go for yours?

28:34.879 --> 28:36.256
I have to be in Peckham at 1:00.

28:36.339 --> 28:39.300
It's at an old chapel where my parents
used to do amateur dramatics.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.344
Well, at least you have till 1:00.

28:41.428 --> 28:44.013
- My ceremony starts at noon, so...
- Noon?

28:44.848 --> 28:46.599
Not the reaction I needed.

28:46.683 --> 28:47.683
You should be fine.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.269
If you hurry.

28:49.352 --> 28:51.062
And customs goes smoothly.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.939
Oh man.

28:54.899 --> 28:57.444
Cumulus clouds. Best clouds ever.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.449
They're the only thing on this earth
that looks like how you drew it as a kid.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.033
Hmm.

29:04.117 --> 29:06.828
So, your family's
not a collection of stick figures?

29:06.911 --> 29:09.038
- Mine definitely is.
- Okay, that I wanna see.

29:09.122 --> 29:12.667
Sorry, no meeting the family
till the fifth date.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.961
Says the girl
who slept with me on the first.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.549
I'm breaking all my rules for you.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.492
I need you to keep moving.

29:45.575 --> 29:47.118
- Give me your phone.
- Okay.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.042
- Sir, can't have you holding up the line.
- Sorry. I'll be two seconds.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.433
- This is my number.
- UK passports to the left.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.310

- Text me so I've got yours.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.334
Sir, now.

29:55.376 --> 29:56.628
- Cool.
- Yeah, I'm going.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.255
Yep. I'll see you on the other side.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.339
Wait. What?

30:00.381 --> 30:01.925
See you on the other side.

30:02.008 --> 30:03.051
Okay.

30:03.134 --> 30:05.345
It's not like the lines
lead to separate countries.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.598
Oh shit.

Next, please.

Next!

- Um, morning.

30:40.713 --> 30:41.798
Hi. Sorry.

30:42.632 --> 30:43.632
Um...

30:44.008 --> 30:46.010
- There.
- What brings you to London?

30:46.094 --> 30:47.262
Uh, a wedding.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.847
And how long will you be staying?

30:48.930 --> 30:50.348
Uh, just the weekend.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.059
And did you get his name or number?

30:55.270 --> 30:56.271
What?

30:56.354 --> 30:58.606
Of the person you're staying with.

31:00.275 --> 31:01.985
Oh, yeah, um...

31:02.068 --> 31:02.986
Andrew Sullivan.

31:03.069 --> 31:03.903
He's my dad.

31:03.987 --> 31:07.615
We're gonna be at the, uh, Spits...
Spitalfield Hotel for the wedding.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.760
That's where we're staying.
My dad's getting married.

36:57.924 --> 36:58.924
Hadley?

37:00.843 --> 37:01.761
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:01.844 --> 37:03.554
Oh God, it's good to see you.

37:06.432 --> 37:08.351
Look at you. You look different.

37:08.976 --> 37:10.978
- More, uh, grown up.
- Yep.

37:11.812 --> 37:13.564
Weird how that happens.

37:14.857 --> 37:17.360
Anyways, congrats.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.028
- Big day.
- Well, thank you.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.113
Um, that means a lot,

37:21.197 --> 37:23.407
and we're really glad that you're here.

37:23.491 --> 37:26.911
Well, you know,
tried my hardest to miss it.

37:26.994 --> 37:28.621
Yeah. Yep.

37:28.704 --> 37:30.039
That was a joke.

37:30.122 --> 37:32.500
Yeah. It's a funny joke. Um...

37:32.583 --> 37:35.086
Hey, listen,
there's something I want to ask you,

37:35.169 --> 37:38.798
which didn't feel right
to bring up over text or mobile...

37:38.881 --> 37:40.967
- Cell phone.
- Yep. Um...

37:42.093 --> 37:44.553
Charlotte and I were wondering if...

37:45.805 --> 37:48.432
...you would do a father-daughter dance
with me at the reception.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.350
Oh.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.811
I told her you would think
it was stupid. I know, it's...

37:51.894 --> 37:52.937
Fine.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.064
Real... It's fine?

37:55.147 --> 37:56.232
Yeah. It's fine.

37:56.315 --> 37:58.734
- Uh, was that it, or...?
- Yeah.

37:58.818 --> 38:00.736
- Yeah. That's great. Okay.
- Great.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.405
Hadley!

38:02.488 --> 38:04.490
So great to finally meet you.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.036
Your dad was in a state when he thought
you weren't going to make it.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.372
- He wanted to call the whole thing off.
- Really?

38:11.455 --> 38:13.666
Yeah. Are you kidding?
I'm not gonna do it without you.

38:13.749 --> 38:14.959
I mean, you're my daughter.

38:15.793 --> 38:19.755
Hey, the photographer told me to tell you
that he needs you ready in five minutes.

38:19.839 --> 38:22.383
Well, tell him to bugger off.
I'm with our guest of honor.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.593
- Okay.
- No, don't you dare.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.721
Oh.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.099
All right then. Photos it is.

38:30.182 --> 38:31.462
You only get one big day, right?

38:31.517 --> 38:33.352
Well, you know, not statistically.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.796
- Char, some guests want to say goodbye.
- Okay.

38:37.898 --> 38:41.068
Oh, Tom! Karen!
You made it! Oh, you all look so lovely!

38:41.152 --> 38:43.529
Uh, look.
We'll be back for the reception.

38:43.612 --> 38:47.491
We've just got to pop
to a memorial at Peckham House.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.660
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

38:49.744 --> 38:50.578
Who?

38:50.661 --> 38:52.413
A friend of Tom's
from the theater.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.498
It's a tragic story, really.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.668
Uh, married, two sons,
beat cancer 12 years ago,

38:57.752 --> 38:59.670
only for it to come back out of the blue.

38:59.754 --> 39:03.007
One of her boys had to fly home
from uni in the States.

39:03.507 --> 39:08.346
Gosh. Can you imagine making that trip
all alone for your mum's memorial?

39:09.555 --> 39:11.223
I'm going to a wedding.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.308
Same as you, right?

39:13.225 --> 39:14.810
Actually, that's my loungewear.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.897
Yeah, I just like to relax
in a finely pressed suit.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.901
<i>There is only a 0.2% chance</i>

39:21.984 --> 39:24.987
<i>that Oliver and Hadley's families
have mutual friends.</i>

39:25.988 --> 39:28.574
Hadley, honey, um,
we're gonna do some photos now.

39:29.867 --> 39:32.995
In 13 minutes,
a London bus will depart Shoreditch,

39:33.079 --> 39:34.538
headed towards Peckham,

39:34.622 --> 39:36.499
which means Hadley Sullivan

39:36.582 --> 39:39.460
only has two minutes
to decide if she's going to be on it.

39:40.461 --> 39:43.506
If she isn't,
there's less than a 6% chance

39:43.589 --> 39:45.674
she will ever see Oliver Jones again.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.235
Yeah, um...

39:47.259 --> 39:50.137
You see, fate can only be fate

39:50.846 --> 39:53.265
if we <i>decide</i> that we want it to be.

39:56.477 --> 39:57.520
Um...

39:57.603 --> 40:00.106
- Hadley, what are you doing?
- Sorry, I...

40:00.189 --> 40:02.149
- I have to go.
- What?

40:02.233 --> 40:05.027
Yeah, there's something
I... I have to go just do,

40:05.111 --> 40:07.488
but I'll, uh, come back.

40:07.571 --> 40:08.572
Right now, in London?

40:08.656 --> 40:11.492
Yeah. How long
till the reception and the drinks and the...

40:11.575 --> 40:12.701
Four hours.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.870
Great. I'll... I'll see you then. I promise.

40:15.746 --> 40:17.015
What are... Where are you going?

40:17.039 --> 40:18.290
It's fine. I'll be fine.

40:50.739 --> 40:53.075
<i>Hadley wasn't sure
this was the right decision,</i>

40:53.159 --> 40:55.953
<i>but something inside her
kept saying she needed to be there.</i>

40:56.036 --> 40:58.414
Uh, does this bus go to Peckham?

40:58.497 --> 40:59.790
It does if you pay today.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.000
Uh, how do I do that?

41:01.083 --> 41:02.710
By touching your Oyster.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.587
Touching my...

41:05.588 --> 41:08.674
- Just use a credit card.
- Right. Obviously. Makes sense.

41:09.592 --> 41:10.592
Mm.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.054
- Off you go.
- Cool. Sorry.

41:17.308 --> 41:19.560
Kids these days.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.312
Wait.

41:22.938 --> 41:25.232
<i>Didn't think
that was the whole story, did you?</i>

41:45.377 --> 41:46.545
Next, please.

42:22.623 --> 42:24.708
Whoo!

42:24.792 --> 42:26.585
Ollie!

42:26.669 --> 42:30.464
Yo, yo, yo! My bro!
This is your welcome back track!

42:30.548 --> 42:31.924
Sorry about this.

42:32.007 --> 42:33.634
- Luther.
- DJ Jonesy.

42:33.717 --> 42:34.717
Find me on Insta.

42:35.261 --> 42:36.095
Hmm?

42:36.178 --> 42:37.972
- Surprise.
- You're gonna get us arrested.

42:38.055 --> 42:38.931
Uh, for what?

42:39.014 --> 42:40.724
The crime of my sick beats?

42:40.808 --> 42:42.434
DJ Jonesy. Find me on Insta.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.647
Okay, yeah. Maybe we should go.

42:49.483 --> 42:51.986
Right. Before you say anything,
I wasn't busking.

42:52.069 --> 42:53.829
I was welcoming
my brother back from America.

42:53.904 --> 42:55.656
You better go and do it somewhere else.

42:55.739 --> 42:56.824
Yes, sir. Understood.

42:56.907 --> 42:58.507
We were just leaving, weren't we, Ollie?

42:58.534 --> 43:00.828
Actually, I was just sort of waiting
for someone.

43:00.911 --> 43:02.538
Well, I sort of don't care.

43:03.330 --> 43:04.957
Okay. Let's go.

43:08.711 --> 43:10.431

44:04.016 --> 44:05.225
Surprising.

<i>Finally in Peckham,</i>

44:20.240 --> 44:23.118
<i>Oliver Jones prepared himself
for the day's event.</i>

44:23.202 --> 44:26.747
<i>This, naturally, involved putting on
a Shakespearean costume.</i>

44:26.830 --> 44:28.540
How you doing in there, Romeo?

44:28.624 --> 44:30.876
I'm not Romeo. I'm Macbeth.

44:30.959 --> 44:32.544
Well...

44:33.462 --> 44:35.005
You look smashing.

44:35.506 --> 44:38.050
Yeah. All right, Bugs Bunny.
Let's do this, shall we?

44:38.842 --> 44:40.386
- I'm Bottom.
- Bottom?

44:40.886 --> 44:43.889
- Of course. Yeah, bottom of the barrel.
- Shakespeare character.

44:43.972 --> 44:48.977
<i>In spite of there being
one Puck, two Hamlets, and five Juliets,</i>

44:49.061 --> 44:51.605
<i>this wasn't your typical
Shakespeare-themed party.</i>

44:52.106 --> 44:55.234
<i>In fact, it wasn't a party at all.</i>

45:01.824 --> 45:03.992
Oi. Oi.

45:04.076 --> 45:05.261
Hey, Dad.

45:06.286 --> 45:08.122
- Good to see ya.
- Oh! Hey.

45:08.205 --> 45:09.998
Good to see you. How was your flight?

45:10.082 --> 45:13.127
- Surprising. Though he wouldn't say why.
- You okay?

45:13.210 --> 45:14.753
- Uh, where's Mum?
- Here.

45:16.922 --> 45:17.922
Hey, Mum.

45:19.466 --> 45:20.592
Oliver.

45:24.096 --> 45:26.640
Good day to thee, fair friends!

45:26.724 --> 45:27.933
Thank you all for coming

45:28.016 --> 45:30.394
to what can only be described

45:30.477 --> 45:33.814
as Tess Jones's living memorial.

45:34.815 --> 45:38.110
Or as our son Luther
likes to call it, her farewell party.

45:38.193 --> 45:39.753
But he's a little bit simple like that.

45:39.778 --> 45:41.098
We do love him.

45:41.155 --> 45:44.450
So, yes, thank you for...
for helping her

45:44.533 --> 45:46.869
realize her dream
of having all her friends

45:46.952 --> 45:48.203
and some of her enemies

45:48.287 --> 45:49.788
perform for her.

45:50.289 --> 45:53.625
Acceptable eulogies
will be musical numbers,

45:54.209 --> 45:55.419
interpretive dance...

45:55.502 --> 45:57.230
Thank you very much, Gloria. Yes.

45:57.254 --> 46:00.215
And iambic pentameter
from yours truly.

46:00.299 --> 46:01.884
Um, and without further ado,

46:01.967 --> 46:05.387
the... the star of the evening,
and the center of attention,

46:05.888 --> 46:07.431
would like to say a few words.

46:07.514 --> 46:08.514
So here she is.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.351
The love of my life.

46:12.436 --> 46:13.479
My summer's day.

46:19.234 --> 46:21.737
Tess.

46:26.700 --> 46:29.995
Thank you, all of you, for...

46:32.664 --> 46:35.042
being here, uh, today.

46:36.126 --> 46:40.714
Well, yes, so what happened was
that Val and I were planning my funeral,

46:40.798 --> 46:44.009
and it was just turning into
such a brilliant show

46:44.092 --> 46:47.221
that I realized
I... I wanted to be alive to see it, so...

46:47.304 --> 46:48.722
And you <i>are</i> right.

46:49.515 --> 46:53.894
I <i>do</i> hate it when people say
nice things about me behind my back.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.979
I think it's a... it's a tragic waste.

46:58.774 --> 47:03.153
You only really know
what kind of story yours is

47:03.237 --> 47:04.613
when you know the ending.

47:05.239 --> 47:07.699
And, um...

47:08.992 --> 47:13.247
...I now know that mine is a love story.

47:15.082 --> 47:18.836
I feel like my life really began
the first day that I met Val

47:19.503 --> 47:20.879
in a Shakespeare class.

47:21.630 --> 47:22.506
Uh, at uni.

47:22.589 --> 47:25.092
He was giving
his Richard III.

47:25.175 --> 47:26.426
- Brilliantly.
- Terrible.

47:28.387 --> 47:30.556
But as the Bard says,

47:30.639 --> 47:34.643
"Whoever loved,
that loved not at first sight?"

47:34.726 --> 47:37.145
What can I say? I have eccentric tastes.

47:37.729 --> 47:41.358
And since then we have written

47:41.441 --> 47:46.196
the most beautiful story together
with our two darling, dashing,

47:47.114 --> 47:49.575
daring sons.

47:49.658 --> 47:53.704
And I am so grateful
to each one of you for being a part of it.

47:57.207 --> 47:58.333
It's been glorious.

47:59.668 --> 48:01.295
So, let's be merry.

48:02.004 --> 48:05.424
Let's eat as much as we possibly can

48:05.507 --> 48:07.092
and get really drunk.

48:07.175 --> 48:11.221
And the only rule of the day is...

48:17.060 --> 48:18.896
...don't forget to say goodbye.

48:19.438 --> 48:21.064
Okay. Ta-da!

48:21.815 --> 48:22.649
The end.

48:22.733 --> 48:25.527
Ah! Thank you, thank you!

48:25.611 --> 48:27.738
We should be here
for at least one night only.

48:29.823 --> 48:32.284
Get this old hand off the stage.

48:36.413 --> 48:40.834
Now, I'm happy to announce that I shall
be performing my Shakespeare medley...

48:40.918 --> 48:44.755
<i>Tessa Jones's living memorial
lasted one hour and 32 minutes.</i>

48:45.756 --> 48:49.676
<i>Twenty-six eulogies were performed,
including nine monologues...</i>

48:50.302 --> 48:52.596
...honesty or...

48:52.679 --> 48:53.722
Fuck, I've gone and dried.

48:53.805 --> 48:55.432
It's completely gone.

48:55.515 --> 48:57.100
I've had a nightmare learning this.

48:57.184 --> 48:58.352
<i>...five poems...</i>

48:58.435 --> 48:59.645
Ooh!

48:59.728 --> 49:02.439
She <i>loves</i> me!

49:03.565 --> 49:05.025
<i>...eight songs,</i>

49:06.151 --> 49:07.527
<i>three dances,</i>

49:09.029 --> 49:10.280
<i>one freestyle rap,</i>

49:12.032 --> 49:14.034
<i>and a bizarre DJ set.</i>

49:16.828 --> 49:19.039
When I say "DJ," you say "Jonesy."

49:19.122 --> 49:19.957
DJ!

49:20.040 --> 49:21.583
- What? Who?
- What?

49:21.667 --> 49:22.960
Oh, better than that.

49:23.043 --> 49:25.003
- DJ!
- Jonesy!

49:25.087 --> 49:26.797
- DJ!
- Jonesy!

49:26.880 --> 49:28.131
- DJ!
- Jonesy!

49:28.215 --> 49:29.591
Whoo!

49:30.592 --> 49:33.178
<i>87% of the guests
were moved to tears.</i>

49:34.388 --> 49:36.890
<i>The word "love" was used 39 times.</i>

49:37.808 --> 49:39.017
<i>And one son</i>

49:39.559 --> 49:42.688
<i>wished he was still holding hands
with the girl from the plane.</i>

50:03.208 --> 50:06.378
<i>As Oliver Jones took time away
from his mother's memorial,</i>

50:06.878 --> 50:10.632
<i>Hadley Sullivan averaged
19 kilometers per hour towards it.</i>

50:20.642 --> 50:21.802
<i>Peckham House.</i>

50:44.708 --> 50:45.959
Oh. Excuse me.

50:46.043 --> 50:47.294
- Yes?
- Hi.

50:47.377 --> 50:50.756
Um, could you help me? My phone's dead.
I'm trying to get to Peckham House.

50:50.839 --> 50:52.299
Oh, okay. Yes.

50:52.382 --> 50:56.094
So, right on Queen's Road,
left on King's Grove.

50:56.178 --> 50:58.305
It's on the left through the gate.

50:58.388 --> 50:59.723
Great. Cool. Thank you.

50:59.806 --> 51:03.143
- You have no idea how much I needed that.
- Well, I hope you find him.

51:05.979 --> 51:07.731
Wait.

51:16.740 --> 51:17.740
There you are.

51:18.450 --> 51:19.451
What's the matter?

51:20.160 --> 51:21.453
I'm fine, Mum.

51:22.829 --> 51:25.082
- Talk to me.
- Hey, go... go sit down.

51:26.374 --> 51:27.834
Go on. You're gonna miss your party.

51:27.918 --> 51:28.918
Oliver...

51:32.923 --> 51:33.923
Talk to me.

51:35.717 --> 51:36.717
I just...

51:37.094 --> 51:39.971
I just don't understand
why you're not getting treatment.

51:41.223 --> 51:42.224
I've read the data.

51:43.767 --> 51:44.976
I know that...

51:45.060 --> 51:48.146
I know that if you started with the chemo
with an anti-inflammatory diet,

51:48.230 --> 51:51.149
you could have another 6 months,
12 months, maybe even 18 months.

51:51.233 --> 51:52.233
Why?

51:55.153 --> 51:56.153
Serious question.

51:57.656 --> 51:59.991
So, I can... be sick

52:00.992 --> 52:01.827
all the time?

52:04.412 --> 52:05.412
You'd be here.

52:09.543 --> 52:12.087
I know. I'm sorry.

52:12.712 --> 52:17.008
But three months, six, 12 months,
it doesn't really make any difference.

52:17.092 --> 52:18.969
I <i>am</i> still going to die.

52:23.098 --> 52:25.142
I want to still be me.

52:27.394 --> 52:29.354
I'd like to do some living before I go.

52:32.691 --> 52:34.025
- Please.
- Yeah.

52:34.109 --> 52:35.109
Come here.

52:38.488 --> 52:41.741
I love you so, so much.

52:43.660 --> 52:44.660
Okay.

52:44.995 --> 52:46.995
Come and live with me.
C'mon. You know you want to.

52:47.038 --> 52:51.084
Let's make a massive, great,
unforgettable spectacle of ourselves.

52:51.168 --> 52:52.502
Mom, I just need a second.

52:53.587 --> 52:54.880
Okay.

52:59.217 --> 53:00.385
- Love you.
- I love you.

53:32.459 --> 53:33.293
Excuse me.

53:33.376 --> 53:35.128
Uh, is this the memorial?

53:35.212 --> 53:36.880
Oh, for Tessa? Yeah.

53:37.505 --> 53:39.966
Uh, do you know if there's an Oliver here?

53:40.050 --> 53:42.844
Haven't seen him in a while.
Maybe Luther'll know.

53:43.470 --> 53:44.721
Okay. Thank you.

53:56.733 --> 53:58.568
Uh, Luther?

53:59.569 --> 54:01.863
- Yeah?
- You're, uh, Oliver's brother?

54:01.947 --> 54:03.365
Oh. Right?

54:04.532 --> 54:05.617
You're American.

54:06.409 --> 54:07.244
Yeah.

54:07.327 --> 54:10.288
Uh, is Oliver here? I'm a friend.

54:10.789 --> 54:11.831
Yeah.

54:11.915 --> 54:14.542
- Excellent teeth. Excellent teeth.
- Uh, thank you.

54:14.626 --> 54:15.627
Uh, nice van.

54:15.710 --> 54:18.046
Oh yeah, that's a Sprinter.

54:18.129 --> 54:19.839
I can see that.

54:19.923 --> 54:21.633
Let's find Ollie. This way.

54:27.555 --> 54:29.408
- Hi, Mum. Hi, Dad.
- Here he is.

54:29.432 --> 54:30.809
Have you guys seen Ollie?

54:30.892 --> 54:32.102
Not since he left. Why?

54:32.686 --> 54:36.189
Someone is trying to find him.
I present... Oliver's <i>friend.</i>

54:36.273 --> 54:37.565
Oliver's friend?

54:37.649 --> 54:40.819
Hi, yeah. Uh, Hadley.
Nice to meet you guys.

54:40.902 --> 54:42.153
Uh, Val.

54:42.654 --> 54:43.571
Tessa.

54:43.655 --> 54:45.991
Hadley.

54:46.074 --> 54:47.951
Are you... all right, lovely?

54:48.451 --> 54:50.120
You look like you've seen a ghost.

54:50.203 --> 54:52.706
Um, sorry. I just...

54:52.789 --> 54:54.541
I was told... I thought...

54:54.624 --> 54:56.835
Uh, this was a memorial. So I'm...

54:56.918 --> 54:59.212
Oh. You thought I was dead.

54:59.963 --> 55:01.631
I'm very glad that you're not.

55:01.715 --> 55:04.092
Me too.

55:04.175 --> 55:05.468
Um, I brought...

55:05.552 --> 55:08.847
I don't know if it's weird,
but, I, uh... I have these, so...

55:08.930 --> 55:11.516
- You should have them, I guess.
- I think it's less weird now.

55:11.599 --> 55:14.311
- Thank you so... much.
- You're welcome.

55:14.978 --> 55:17.105
And don't worry about the, uh, confusion.

55:17.188 --> 55:21.359
It is pretty unusual for somebody
to have their memorial <i>before</i> they die.

55:21.443 --> 55:23.486
It's kind of a genius idea, though.

55:23.570 --> 55:26.156
I mean, what's the point
of having all these people

55:26.239 --> 55:29.242
say really nice things about you
if you're not around to hear it?

55:29.326 --> 55:31.328
My thoughts exactly.

55:31.411 --> 55:33.246
Uh, let's have a little dance.

55:33.330 --> 55:34.414
Oh, go on, Mum.

55:35.248 --> 55:36.916
- Come on then.
- Hoick me up.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.210
- There we go.
- Lovely to meet you.

55:39.294 --> 55:40.795
- Uh, me too.
- Nice to meet you.

57:02.001 --> 57:03.545
It's horrible.

57:03.628 --> 57:04.963
- I like it.
- No, you don't.

57:05.046 --> 57:06.256
- I do.
- No, you don't.

57:06.339 --> 57:07.339
It's pretty.

57:08.299 --> 57:09.299
For a bruise.

57:12.303 --> 57:13.303
So, how was it?

57:13.930 --> 57:15.181
- The wedding?
- Yeah.

57:15.807 --> 57:17.976
Oh, it doesn't matter.

57:18.059 --> 57:19.059
Come on.

57:20.478 --> 57:21.478
It was

57:22.939 --> 57:24.190
annoyingly nice.

57:24.274 --> 57:28.486
And Charlotte's totally unhateable,
and my dad's genuinely happy, so...

57:28.570 --> 57:30.488
Oh God, that sounds awful.

57:30.572 --> 57:31.573
It was the worst.

57:37.745 --> 57:41.624
I feel pretty shit that I just complained
about my dad that entire flight.

57:42.417 --> 57:43.417
Why?

57:46.212 --> 57:48.548
Because he's... not dying.

57:53.636 --> 57:54.971
Why didn't you tell me?

57:56.181 --> 57:59.476
It's a bit complicated.
Don't you think?

58:00.685 --> 58:02.103
"Hey, nice to meet you."

58:02.187 --> 58:04.981
"Um, by the way,
my mum's dying of lung cancer,

58:05.064 --> 58:09.027
so I'm flying back to London
for her memorial, but, plot twist,

58:09.110 --> 58:10.487
she's not actually dead yet."

58:10.570 --> 58:13.740
"She's just throwing herself
a Shakespeare-themed going-away party,

58:13.823 --> 58:17.035
which is a completely normal thing to do
when you should be getting treatment."

58:23.416 --> 58:24.417
Are you okay?

58:27.462 --> 58:28.505
Yeah, I'm fine.

58:31.883 --> 58:32.883
Really.

58:34.344 --> 58:37.263
You know, only 9% of lung cancer patients
make it past 10 years.

58:38.973 --> 58:40.558
Why do you always do that?

58:41.768 --> 58:42.936
What?

58:43.019 --> 58:47.357
Explain things away
with numbers and stuff, instead of just

58:48.691 --> 58:49.984
saying something honest.

58:52.654 --> 58:54.113
Like...?

58:56.115 --> 58:57.176
Like...

58:57.200 --> 58:58.576
I don't know. Like, anything.

58:58.660 --> 58:59.661
Something that you

59:00.828 --> 59:01.828
really feel.

59:11.673 --> 59:12.674
Um...

59:13.174 --> 59:14.175
Sorry, I...

59:15.760 --> 59:19.055
I... I want to.
I just... feel like this isn't...

59:19.138 --> 59:20.682
- You said to be honest.
- I know.

59:20.765 --> 59:22.767
That's the most honest thing
I've done all day.

59:25.228 --> 59:26.229
Sorry.

59:33.778 --> 59:35.655
I feel like you have a lot
going on right now

59:35.738 --> 59:38.783
and you're pretending
like none of it bothers you.

59:40.660 --> 59:41.911
What would you want me to say?

59:42.787 --> 59:45.456
Do you want me to tell you
that I'm completely gutted?

59:45.957 --> 59:47.792
That I already miss her?

59:47.875 --> 59:49.836
That this is the worst day of my life

59:49.919 --> 59:51.629
apart from the one I know is coming?

59:52.672 --> 59:54.432
I'm trying to be there for you.
I don't know.

59:54.465 --> 59:58.344
Maybe I don't want to spill my guts out
to some girl I just met on a plane.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:03.932
Oi, Ollie.

01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:07.770
People are leaving, so if you want
to do that speech, now's the time.

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.022
Oh yeah. Okay.

01:00:10.231 --> 01:00:11.316
You should go.

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:16.362
It was stupid of me to come.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.446
I didn't mean that.

01:00:18.656 --> 01:00:19.824
Uh, no, it's fine.

01:00:19.907 --> 01:00:23.286
Um, I gotta get back too. So... Uh...

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.625
Tell your family
I really enjoyed meeting them.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:30.209
Come on, Ollie.

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:35.048
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.595
- You all right, Romeo?
- Yeah.

01:00:41.512 --> 01:00:45.475
<i>Approximately 17.6%
of people will walk away</i>

01:00:45.558 --> 01:00:46.976
<i>from the love of their life.</i>

01:00:47.685 --> 01:00:49.979
<i>Oliver was about to be one of them.</i>

01:00:59.113 --> 01:01:02.450
Excuse me.
Sorry, I... think you left your bag.

01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:04.702
Oh, that's not...

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:07.746
Thank you.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.981
Right, um...

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:37.902
Uh, I didn't get a chance to speak
during the eulogies, so...

01:01:39.195 --> 01:01:40.071
...here we go.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.826
Thirty-seven.

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:48.228
That's how many plays
William Shakespeare wrote in his life.

01:01:48.287 --> 01:01:50.998
It's also how many
my mum read or performed

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:53.042
for me and my brother when we were little.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:58.464
Nineteen hundred is how many days
she, uh, she took us to school,

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.216
before I started driving, and...

01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:03.845
Twice is...

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:08.224
...is how many times
she made me strawberry jam roly-polies

01:02:08.307 --> 01:02:09.726
when a girl broke my heart.

01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:17.274
The thing is, is...

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:21.737
I, uh...

01:02:24.532 --> 01:02:27.952
I tried to measure my mum's life
in... in numbers.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.582
It's, uh... It's what I do.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.418
Mum, you know this about me.

01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:38.004
It's what I do with everything.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:40.756
It helps me...

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:44.844
make sense of the world, I guess.

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:53.102
The thing is, is that, well...

01:02:56.814 --> 01:03:00.318
Tessa Jones is not a number.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:07.074
She's not the plays she acted
or the... meals she made

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:09.452
or the advice she gave.

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:20.588
She's my mum.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:27.845
I'm gonna miss you so much.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:38.773
Excuse me.

01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:41.137
- Is this the way to the station?
- Dunno. Sorry.

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:51.452
Ah, shit.

Sorry I ruined your big day.

01:06:12.843 --> 01:06:14.220
I was just worried.

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:20.141
What happened?

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:23.562
Promise you won't freak out?

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:27.817
No, but I still wanna know what happened.

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:31.069
I, um...

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:35.992
I went to find this guy
that I met on the plane.

01:06:37.868 --> 01:06:38.868
A guy.

01:06:40.287 --> 01:06:41.580
- And how old is he?
- Dad.

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:43.749
Sorry.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.042
His name's Oliver.

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:49.714
He's, um, a math nerd.

01:06:50.214 --> 01:06:51.214
And he's

01:06:52.633 --> 01:06:53.633
kind and...

01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:56.679
surprising and...

01:06:57.888 --> 01:07:00.850
Um, I thought he was coming out here
for a wedding, like me,

01:07:00.933 --> 01:07:03.561
but turns out it was
for a memorial for his mom,

01:07:03.644 --> 01:07:04.770
who's actually not dead.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.022
She's just really sick.

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:08.273
And, uh...

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:13.571
I don't know. I just felt like
I needed to be there for him.

01:07:15.656 --> 01:07:17.491
I know that sounds
really stupid.

01:07:17.575 --> 01:07:19.410
Well, why would that sound stupid?

01:07:19.493 --> 01:07:23.748
Because I've known him
for, like, eight hours and...

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:25.511
I dunno.
I sat next to this guy on a plane,

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:27.960
and now I'm bailing on your wedding
to go out and find him,

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.629
and... that's insane and makes no sense.

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.798
It's not supposed to.

01:07:34.008 --> 01:07:35.676
Sounds like you were being brave.

01:07:46.812 --> 01:07:48.314
Why didn't you fight for Mom?

01:07:50.566 --> 01:07:52.068
Why didn't you fight for us?

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.111
Oh, Hadley.

01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:58.407
Why? Why didn't you?

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:05.581
I don't know
that I have a good answer for you.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:08.041
It's hard.

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:13.047
Somewhere along the way, we just

01:08:14.673 --> 01:08:16.926
both stopped puttin' in the work.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:19.345
When I came here,

01:08:21.138 --> 01:08:22.223
we knew.

01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:26.143
Love is a lot of work.

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:30.648
Is that why you picked Charlotte, then?
Because it's easy or...

01:08:31.148 --> 01:08:32.148
No.

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:35.653
No, I... I learned my lesson.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.363
And I don't wanna lose you too.

01:08:43.327 --> 01:08:44.578
I liked our old life.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:51.210
I didn't want it to change.

01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:54.879
I'm sorry.

01:08:57.841 --> 01:08:59.385
I never meant to hurt you.

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:02.303
I know.

01:09:11.897 --> 01:09:12.897
It's okay.

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:17.527
Really. It's okay.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:24.160
I'm glad you're happy, Dad.

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:26.493
You <i>are?</i>

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:30.666
Yeah, I know.
It's a shocker for me too, but...

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:33.501
Yeah, I am.

01:09:37.046 --> 01:09:38.046
Thank you.

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:41.926
You're welcome.

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:44.638
It's so good to talk.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:47.515
I missed you.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:53.856
Should we finally get to the party now?

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:58.527
Oh, hey, cool trainers.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.154
<i>Sneakers,</i> Dad.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:03.449
Charlotte.

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:05.659
I know. I think if you give her a chance...

01:10:05.743 --> 01:10:06.911
No, <i>Charlotte.</i>

01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:08.287
Hey, honey!

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:09.580
Hello, babe.

01:10:09.663 --> 01:10:11.543
I'm absolutely starved.
I haven't eaten all day.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:14.001
Or all month, if I'm being honest.

01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:16.587
- Would you like some?
- Oh no. Thank you. I'm good.

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:20.299
- Is everything all right?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. We were just... talking.

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:21.383
Mm.

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:24.720
I'm sorry I just ran off like that.

01:10:24.803 --> 01:10:27.514
Oh, it's fine. All of the pressure
that I've been putting on you

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:30.226
with the bridesmaid thing
and the dance thing,

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:31.560
I would have run away too.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:32.728
It's not that actually.

01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:35.522
No, it's just I know how important
you are to your dad.

01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:37.566
And I just really want you to like me.

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:40.736
Sorry. I'm being intense again.

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:41.737
It's okay.

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:44.823
Sure you don't want some sandwich?

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.387
- I'm good. I don't do mayonnaise.
- She doesn't do mayonnaise.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:48.910
Yeah.

01:10:57.378 --> 01:11:00.172
Do you know what? I really like her.

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.923
- Can't have been easy walking in here.
- Mm.

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:07.346
- Plus, she fancies you!
- Mom, shut up.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:11.183
- Are we going to talk about her?
- No, we're not.

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:14.751
You know how bad the odds are
on long-distance relationships?

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:17.147
It's like 56%. I'm not gonna do it.

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:19.400
Hold on. Hadley Ella Sullivan.

01:11:19.483 --> 01:11:21.151
- Born January the 16th.
- Give me that.

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:22.319
- Very nice.
- Come on!

01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:24.446
You honestly have to get this to her.

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:26.240
I can't. I don't know where she is, do I?

01:11:26.323 --> 01:11:27.908
Well, that's what the Internet's for.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:30.160
I can't believe you. Wait. Oi!

01:11:30.244 --> 01:11:31.287
That's not for you.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:32.970
Don't fight.

01:11:33.038 --> 01:11:34.290
I'm dying. Don't fight.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:36.583
- Stop it. Leave him alone!
- Give it here!

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:40.628
Sweeties?

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:42.589
It's a very good book.

01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:43.757
Mm.

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:45.175
And what's this?

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:46.969
At Saint Luke's Church!

01:11:47.052 --> 01:11:50.639
Reception afterwards
at the Naval College at 6:00 p.m.

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:52.808
There you are. That's great.

01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:54.911
- So you want me to crash a wedding?
- Ugh!

01:11:54.935 --> 01:11:56.312
Just go.

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:57.980
Who cares what the odds are?

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:00.649
Come on, Mum.

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:02.502
- Let's get you home.
- Yeah. It's a good idea.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:05.487
Okay? Up. Up.

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.281
I'll bring the... I'll bring the oxygen.

01:12:07.364 --> 01:12:08.764
- Okay. Go, go, go.
- You better go.

01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:12.328
Um...

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:15.539
You know...

01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:18.625
if I knew the odds

01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:21.211
that your mother was gonna get cancer and...

01:12:21.795 --> 01:12:24.340
and die when I fell in love with her,

01:12:26.091 --> 01:12:28.385
do you know
what I would have done differently?

I've been late all day.

01:13:57.057 --> 01:13:58.809
Sounds like there's a story there.

01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:01.270

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:04.106

Yeah.

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.290
Yeah, I guess it does.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.835
