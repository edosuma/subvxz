That was just my...
‐ Boyfriend?

19:24.748 --> 19:26.959
It's okay if it was.
It's just, like I said...

19:27.876 --> 19:29.127
you texted me.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.213
‐ No, no, no. Um,

19:31.213 --> 19:33.507
I do not have a boyfriend. I mean,

19:33.507 --> 19:35.509
really. I don't know what we are.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.679
This is just my friend I came here with,

19:38.679 --> 19:41.723
telling me she left to go to some
after‐party with another girl.

19:42.683 --> 19:44.309
But,

19:44.309 --> 19:46.937
in the spirit of being honest,
I guess I...

19:46.937 --> 19:50.482
did ask you out to try to
make him jealous. I'm sorry.

20:12.087 --> 20:15.007
I can't stop asking you out.
What is happening?

20:15.007 --> 20:18.302

early to be on a plane, but, um,

20:18.302 --> 20:20.012
let's hang out when I get back.

20:21.305 --> 20:22.598

this fucking milestone
