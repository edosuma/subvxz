00:26.850 --> 00:30.729
I hate scary movies. I should
be studying. You know I got a bio due.

00:30.812 --> 00:32.939
Baby, did I mention that
these tickets were free?

00:33.023 --> 00:36.902
Sandra Bullock is playing
right down the street.

00:36.985 --> 00:40.697
Nobody wanna pay $7.50 see some Sandra
Bullock shit... unless she's naked.

00:40.739 --> 00:44.826
Oh, but you will sit through
a movie called Stab?

00:44.910 --> 00:47.996
It's adrenaline, Maureen.
It's good to be scared.

00:48.079 --> 00:49.998
It's primal.
You know what I'm sayin'?

00:50.081 --> 00:52.000
No, I'm gonna tell you
what it is, okay?

00:52.083 --> 00:54.753
It's a dumb-ass white movie
about some dumb-ass white girls...

00:54.836 --> 00:58.882
gettin' their white asses
cut the fuck up, okay?

00:58.965 --> 01:01.635
Yeah. I suppose Sandra Bullock
is Miss Ethnicity, right?

01:01.718 --> 01:04.804
Well, no, all I'm saying is that
the horror genre is historical...

01:04.888 --> 01:06.848
for excluding
the African-American element.

01:06.932 --> 01:10.393
When the hell you get your Ph. D.
In Black Cinema, Sister Souljah?

01:10.477 --> 01:14.397
Listen, I read my Entertainment Weekly,
okay? I know my shit.

01:14.439 --> 01:17.067
Yeah, Maureen. I read my
Black Beat, too, homey.

01:17.108 --> 01:20.862
Tonight we're going to have an all-black movie,
all-black cast, all-black wardrobe, black eyes-

01:20.946 --> 01:23.782
Everything.
Black-eyed peas. Black cats-

01:23.865 --> 01:26.409
- Crazy.
- Thank you.

01:26.493 --> 01:28.787
- Hi. Here you go.
- What's this?

01:28.870 --> 01:30.789
Stab souvenirs.
The studio send them.

01:30.872 --> 01:33.333
Hah!
And it's white.

01:33.416 --> 01:36.002
- Thanks.

01:36.086 --> 01:38.213
Thank you.

01:45.387 --> 01:48.390
Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:48.473 --> 01:50.684
Very romantic.

01:57.232 --> 01:59.150
Whoa!

03:03.673 --> 03:05.717
Whoo! Take it off!

03:09.804 --> 03:11.723
Now, why has she got
to be naked?

03:11.806 --> 03:14.976
What does that have to do with the plot
of the story, her being butt-ass naked?

03:15.060 --> 03:17.395
I don't know about the plot,
but I got a stiff one.

03:17.479 --> 03:19.731
You better loosen up
that wrist.

03:39.918 --> 03:42.170
Hello?

03:42.254 --> 03:44.214
Hello.

03:44.256 --> 03:47.759
- Who is this?
- Guess.

03:47.842 --> 03:51.763
- No, really. Who is this?
- Were you expecting somebody?

03:52.806 --> 03:55.642
- No.

03:55.725 --> 03:58.853
Bitch, hang the phone up
and Star-69 his ass! Damn!

03:58.937 --> 04:01.064
- Shh!

04:01.147 --> 04:02.774
- Who is this?
- Who would you like it to be?

04:02.857 --> 04:06.903
I don't like games.
Who is this?

04:06.987 --> 04:09.197
Look out back.

04:09.281 --> 04:14.953
You see your boyfriend
anywhere?

04:15.036 --> 04:17.539
I don't even have
a boyfriend right now.

04:17.622 --> 04:20.041
Would you like one?

04:20.125 --> 04:23.378
Damn it all. Can I- Give me some money.
I need to get some popcorn.

04:23.461 --> 04:27.674
- You got money.
- I asked for your money.

04:27.757 --> 04:30.051
What do you say?

04:30.135 --> 04:32.387
Cheap ass.

04:32.470 --> 04:35.974
- Thank you.
- Come on.

04:36.057 --> 04:38.101
Cat got your tongue?

04:38.184 --> 04:41.479
You know, I don't even know you,
and I dislike you already.

04:52.282 --> 04:54.201
Come on!

04:56.453 --> 04:58.371
- Hey, we're sold out.
- Oh, cool!

05:01.124 --> 05:03.043
Hello.

05:03.126 --> 05:08.882
Hi. Um, can I have a medium popcorn,
no butter, and a small diet Pepsi?

05:08.965 --> 05:10.884
- You got it.
- Thanks.

05:10.967 --> 05:12.886
That's it. I am not
going back in there.

05:12.969 --> 05:15.138
Come on, you chickenshit.
It's just a movie.

05:15.180 --> 05:17.390
No, it's not just a movie.
It's a true story.

05:17.474 --> 05:19.643
All these kids got killed
a couple years ago in California.

05:19.684 --> 05:22.312
- Here's the popcorn.
- Thanks.

05:22.354 --> 05:25.899
I was so scared,
I almost had a heart attack.

05:25.982 --> 05:28.777
Hah!
Stab you, man!

05:38.328 --> 05:40.247
- Whoa!

05:43.833 --> 05:46.836
- You ass!
- I'm sorry. I had to, baby.

05:46.878 --> 05:50.090
- What are you playing?
- Would you relax?

05:50.173 --> 05:52.092
God! What's wrong with you?

05:52.175 --> 05:54.844
I don't like being scared.
I don't like that.

05:54.928 --> 05:57.722
Baby, it's just
a movie.

05:57.764 --> 06:00.684
Besides, scary movies
are great foreplay.

06:00.725 --> 06:03.436
Excuse me?

06:03.520 --> 06:05.480
Let's go see
Sandra Bullock.

06:05.564 --> 06:10.402
Oh, no. Sandra started already.
We can stay.

06:10.485 --> 06:12.571
Just stop playin' so much.

06:16.116 --> 06:18.994
All right. I gotta go
to the bathroom.

06:20.453 --> 06:22.414
See ya inside.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.359
Sorry.

07:35.153 --> 07:37.113
Hello?

08:50.604 --> 08:53.732
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't do that!

09:00.113 --> 09:02.908
Move! Move!
Go!

09:02.991 --> 09:04.910
All right, go!

09:10.040 --> 09:12.209
Baby, give it up.

09:14.544 --> 09:16.838
You came back just in time.
It looks like she's about to get it.

09:16.922 --> 09:18.840
Want some popcorn?

09:23.595 --> 09:25.931
Uh-uh. See, if that was me,
I would be out of there.

09:32.312 --> 09:35.065
Oh!
Here it comes!

09:35.106 --> 09:38.235
- Here it comes!

09:38.318 --> 09:40.403
Here it comes!
Oh, my God!

11:44.694 --> 11:47.572
Whoa, oh, oh

11:47.656 --> 11:52.118
This could be
your lucky day

11:52.202 --> 11:56.957
In hell

11:57.040 --> 12:01.044
- Never know who it might be

12:01.127 --> 12:03.296
At your doorbell

12:06.466 --> 12:10.929
This could be
your lucky day

12:10.971 --> 12:15.559
In hell

12:17.978 --> 12:19.938
Hello?

12:21.273 --> 12:24.401
- Hello?
- Hello, Sidney.

12:24.484 --> 12:28.321
- Yes?
- What's your favorite scary movie?

12:28.405 --> 12:32.242
- Who is this?
- You tell me.

12:33.994 --> 12:38.665
Cory Gillis,
555-0176.

12:38.748 --> 12:40.792
- Oh, shit!
- Hot flash, Cory-

12:40.876 --> 12:42.794
- Shit!
- Crank calls are a criminal offense...

12:42.878 --> 12:45.171
prosecuted under
penal code 653-M.

12:47.257 --> 12:49.175
Hope you enjoyed
the movie.

12:49.259 --> 12:51.344
Time to change
numbers again?

12:51.428 --> 12:53.346
No. It'll die off.

12:53.430 --> 12:55.473
It's opening weekend.
We'll see how it goes.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.475
Okay.

12:58.977 --> 13:00.937
You know, Ron, uh,

13:00.979 --> 13:03.940
it's not an easy thing to be accused
of a crime you didn't commit,

13:03.982 --> 13:07.444
particularly one
as heinous as murder.

13:07.485 --> 13:09.446
But how do people treat you
now that they know the truth...

13:09.487 --> 13:11.448
- about your innocence?
- Most people are cool.

13:11.489 --> 13:14.451
There's some who still keep
a safe distance, which is odd for me,

13:14.492 --> 13:16.703
'cause I've always been
sort of a people person.

13:16.786 --> 13:19.206
But you were
wrongly accused!

13:19.289 --> 13:21.208
You were fully exonerated.

13:21.291 --> 13:22.959
Yeah, well, that and a nickel
will get you a cup of coffee.

13:23.043 --> 13:25.629
- Even that's not true anymore.

13:25.712 --> 13:27.714
Well, certainly, with Gale Weathers'
book- and now the movie-

13:27.797 --> 13:31.551
- it's set the record straight for Cotton Weary.
- One would think.

13:31.635 --> 13:33.386
But, uh, Gale's-
Gale's been terrific.

13:33.470 --> 13:35.972
Hey! Move your ass, okay?
You're late.

13:36.014 --> 13:40.352
Don't forget about the martini mixer
tonight at the Delta Lambda Zetas.

13:40.435 --> 13:43.813
- I don't think I'm going to be able to make it, Hal.
- What?

13:43.855 --> 13:46.858
Don't even try to bag, okay?
'Cause you promised me.

13:46.942 --> 13:50.237
- A vague promise at best.
- Nobody's asking you to join, okay?

13:50.320 --> 13:52.405
It's a party.
Free beer, meet the girls.

13:52.489 --> 13:54.407
Hallie, you know me
and organized religion.

13:54.491 --> 13:56.826
- It's a sorority.
- Worse.

13:56.868 --> 14:00.205
Look, Sid, just lower the walls
for the next few days.

14:00.247 --> 14:03.542
This self-induced isolation
you got goin' is not healthy.

14:03.583 --> 14:06.086
- I'm fine.
- "I'm fine."

14:06.169 --> 14:10.215
Yes, I know. "I'm fine" is stretched
tightly across your face.

14:10.298 --> 14:12.217
Check out the news.

14:17.222 --> 14:19.432
The two Windsor College
students were murdered...

14:19.516 --> 14:23.186
last night during a sneak preview
of the new movie Stab.

14:23.270 --> 14:26.773
Police haven't released any information
except for the victims' names,

14:26.856 --> 14:29.818
but a press conference is scheduled
for later today.

14:29.901 --> 14:32.821
The victims, Maureen Evans
and Phil Stevens,

14:32.904 --> 14:34.823
were both Windsor seniors.

14:34.906 --> 14:38.368
- Where's Randy?
- He's got Film Theory this morning.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.453
...ended with the brutal murders
of two promising-

14:50.046 --> 14:52.132
Sidney! Sidney!

14:52.215 --> 14:54.134
Sidney, did you know
the victims?

14:54.217 --> 14:56.136
- Do you feel threatened by the murders?
- No comment.

14:56.219 --> 14:58.138
- Do you think there'll be more murders?
- Sidney! Sidney!

14:58.221 --> 15:00.432
- What can you tell us about the victims?
- How about the police?

15:00.515 --> 15:03.351
- We just need one statement.
- Please talk to us!

15:03.435 --> 15:06.813
You could say what happened in that
theater is a result of the movie itself.

15:06.897 --> 15:10.984
That is so Moral Majority. You can't
blame real violence on entertainment.

15:11.067 --> 15:14.446
What? Wait a second. Yes, you can.
Don't you even watch the news?

15:14.487 --> 15:16.948
Yeah. Hello! The murderer was wearing
a ghost mask, okay?

15:16.990 --> 15:19.326
Just like in the movie.
It's directly responsible.

15:19.409 --> 15:22.120
No, it's not. Movies are not responsible
for our actions.

15:22.204 --> 15:26.249
It's a classic case of life
imitating art imitating life.

15:26.291 --> 15:28.710
This is not a hypothetical.
It's not about art.

15:28.793 --> 15:31.421
I had Biology with that girl.
This is reality.

15:31.463 --> 15:35.258
Thank you. I agree with you.
Let me tell you about reality, Mickey.

15:35.300 --> 15:37.260
I lived through this.
Okay?

15:37.302 --> 15:39.429
Life is life.
It doesn't imitate anything.

15:39.512 --> 15:41.806
Come on, Randy,
with all due respect,

15:41.890 --> 15:44.517
the killer obviously patterned himself
after two serial killers...

15:44.601 --> 15:47.729
- who have been immortalized on film.
- Thank you.

15:47.812 --> 15:50.232
Are you suggesting that someone's trying
to make a real-life sequel?

15:50.315 --> 15:54.069
Stab 2? Who'd want to do that?
Sequels suck.

15:54.152 --> 15:56.071
- Oh, please. Please!

15:56.154 --> 15:59.282
- By definition alone, they're inferior films.
- Bullshit generalization.

15:59.324 --> 16:01.451
Many sequels have
surpassed their original.

16:01.535 --> 16:03.995
- Oh, yeah?
- Name one.

16:04.037 --> 16:05.580
Aliens. Far better
than the first.

16:05.664 --> 16:07.541
Yeah, well, there's
no accounting for taste.

16:07.624 --> 16:09.793
Thank you. Ridley Scott rules.
Name another.

16:09.834 --> 16:14.214
No. Aliens is a classic, okay?
"Get away from her, you bitch!"

16:14.297 --> 16:16.967
Believe the line is "Stay away from her,
you bitch. " It's film class, right?

16:19.052 --> 16:21.137
- Whatever. You know what I mean.
- Another.

16:21.179 --> 16:22.722
- T2.
- Mmm.

16:22.806 --> 16:24.516
You've got a hard-on
for Cameron.

16:24.599 --> 16:26.643
- Big one.
- Wait a second.

16:26.685 --> 16:29.563
- The first Terminator is historical.
- Yeah.

16:29.646 --> 16:32.566
"Sarah Connor?"
"Yes."

16:32.649 --> 16:34.568
- All right. All right, okay.

16:34.651 --> 16:36.945
House Il:
The Second Story.

16:37.028 --> 16:42.576
- What?
- The entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels.

16:42.659 --> 16:44.953
Hey, I got it, by the way.
I got it.

16:45.036 --> 16:47.122
The Godfather, Part II.

16:51.042 --> 16:53.712
Very good.
That's the Oscar-winning exception.

16:53.795 --> 16:56.840
- All right, that's enough.

16:56.923 --> 17:02.387
That'll be a wrap. The sequel discussion
to be continued.

17:04.890 --> 17:08.059
So, Mr. Originality, how would
you make it different?

17:08.143 --> 17:10.561
I'd let the geek
get the girl.

17:16.151 --> 17:18.069
Three hundred people watched.
Nobody did anything.

17:18.153 --> 17:20.405
They thought it was a publicity stunt,
for Christ's sakes.

17:20.488 --> 17:22.449
And it would have been a good one too.

17:22.531 --> 17:24.451
- It's starting again, Randy.
- It's not.

17:24.534 --> 17:27.746
Shit happens at the movies. People
get robbed, shot, maimed, murdered.

17:27.829 --> 17:30.749
Multiplex is just a very dangerous place
to be these days.

17:30.790 --> 17:32.959
Yeah, and you are
in extreme denial.

17:33.043 --> 17:35.629
And you should be too.
This has nothing to do with us.

17:35.712 --> 17:37.631
Randy, a guy in a ghost mask
hacked up two people...

17:37.714 --> 17:40.342
in a movie theater
telling our life story.

17:40.425 --> 17:44.179
- Coincidence?
- You know what happened at Woodsboro.

17:44.262 --> 17:47.682
- You can't ignore it.
- I know, Sid, but I don't want to go back there again.

17:47.766 --> 17:50.227
Can't we just go back to our
pseudo-quasi-happy existence?

17:50.268 --> 17:53.855
- Hello, Derek. How ya doin'?
- Hey, Sid.

17:53.939 --> 17:56.274
- I heard. You weren't in class.
- Yeah, I know.

17:56.316 --> 17:58.985
I skipped. I couldn't take all
the "that's her" looks.

17:59.069 --> 18:00.987
Is there anything
I can do?

18:01.071 --> 18:02.989
Well, you got any tricks
for getting me back...

18:03.073 --> 18:05.867
to a pseudo-quasi-
happy existence?

18:05.951 --> 18:08.954
- I might just have one for that.
- Yeah?

18:09.037 --> 18:10.956
Oh, yeah?
What is it?

18:16.628 --> 18:18.588
That was pretty good.

18:20.382 --> 18:22.300
Get a room.

18:32.310 --> 18:35.188
They're threatening to what?
Are you kidding me?

18:35.272 --> 18:38.066
They'd be stupid
to pull this movie.

18:38.149 --> 18:41.278
With all this free press, they're
gonna have huge numbers this weekend.

18:41.361 --> 18:43.488
It'll break
box office records.

18:43.572 --> 18:46.908
- Consider it done.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.910
Uh, Miss Weathers?
Hi. I'm Joel.

18:48.994 --> 18:51.121
The affiliate sent me.
I'm your new cameraman.

18:51.204 --> 18:53.164
- Yeah. You got experience?
- Huh? Uh, yeah.

18:53.206 --> 18:55.542
I mean, I'm local,
but I shot the bingo finals.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.544
- Great. Great.
- I almost got an award for that.

18:57.627 --> 18:59.546
All right, listen, Joel.
This is how it works.

18:59.629 --> 19:01.548
I point, you shoot.

19:01.631 --> 19:03.884
You stay focussed and fast on your feet,
and we'll get along fine.

19:03.967 --> 19:05.886
You're playing with the big boys now,
you got it?

19:05.969 --> 19:07.888
Got it! Got you covered.
I'm all over it.

19:07.971 --> 19:09.890
Don't worry about a thing.
How hard can it be?

19:09.973 --> 19:11.892
You point and I shoot.
I'm there!

19:11.975 --> 19:13.977
Excuse me, Miss Weathers?
Uh, could I have a minute?

19:14.060 --> 19:16.146
- No.
- Just one second.

19:16.229 --> 19:18.148
I- I know you probably
get this all the time,

19:18.190 --> 19:20.150
but I just wanted to say
I am such a big fan of your work.

19:20.192 --> 19:22.569
I just finished you book.
I- I couldn't put it down.

19:22.652 --> 19:25.906
Insightful, probing-
I just really, really loved your book.

19:25.989 --> 19:28.867
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Sure.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.869
I'm a writer myself.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.871
I write for the local paper,
for the Post Telegram.

19:32.954 --> 19:36.875
I'm Debbie Salt. I took your seminar
in Chicago last year.

19:36.917 --> 19:40.086
I was the one in the front row asking
all the questions.

19:40.170 --> 19:42.839
- Right. I thought you looked familiar.
- Oh, thank you.

19:42.923 --> 19:44.925
Um, can't wait
to see the movie.

19:45.008 --> 19:47.052
You know, you must be getting
quite a lot of flak on that, right?

19:47.135 --> 19:49.679
I mean, with all the
violence-in-cinema issues.

19:49.763 --> 19:51.932
What is your position
going to be?

19:52.015 --> 19:53.934
- No comment.
- Miss Weathers, please- I would-

19:54.017 --> 19:56.770
It would be an honor for me if I could
just get a quote from you for my story.

19:56.853 --> 19:58.772
Okay. Begin quote:

19:58.855 --> 20:01.566
- Great.
- "Your flattering remarks are both desperate and obvious."

20:01.650 --> 20:03.568
- Ouch!
- End quote.

20:03.652 --> 20:06.571
Gale, what are you doing here? Do you think
these murders are connected to Sidney Prescott?

20:06.655 --> 20:08.573
Miss Weathers, what's your theory
on these murders?

20:08.657 --> 20:10.575
What's your feeling
about this?

20:10.659 --> 20:12.619
May I have your attention.

20:12.702 --> 20:15.705
- My name is Chief Louis Hartley-
- Chief Hartley.

20:15.789 --> 20:19.584
Hi. Gale Weathers,
author of The Woodsboro Murders.

20:19.668 --> 20:21.711
Do you think the killer
will strike again?

20:21.753 --> 20:25.173
We have no evidence
that this is a serial killer.

20:25.257 --> 20:27.175
- I'd like to read from a prepared-
- Can you tell us of any...

20:27.259 --> 20:29.344
precautions
that you're taking?

20:29.427 --> 20:32.847
Well, first of all, we think it's just
an isolated incident,

20:32.931 --> 20:36.476
- and we will be-
- Ladies.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.478
Oh, my God.
This is huge.

20:38.562 --> 20:40.647
Do you have
any suspects?

20:40.730 --> 20:43.316
- Sidney, look. It's Gale Weathers.
- What?

20:43.400 --> 20:45.360
Star of the Gale Weathers
press conference,

20:45.443 --> 20:47.362
based on the book
by Gale Weathers.

20:47.445 --> 20:50.490
Soon to be a major motion picture
starring Gale Weathers.

20:50.574 --> 20:54.119
- Be kind. She saved our lives.
- She had calf implants.

20:54.202 --> 20:57.122
Chief Hartley, do you plan
on giving the town a curfew?

20:57.163 --> 20:59.124
I'm gonna get closer.

21:00.792 --> 21:04.671
- So that's her?
- Yeah.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.968
Hello, girls.
Enjoying yourselves?

21:10.051 --> 21:12.971
- Hello, Sister Lois, Sister Murphy.
- Hello, pledge. Hi, Sidney.

21:13.013 --> 21:17.350
- Hey.
- This must be flat-out hell for you.

21:17.434 --> 21:20.687
- How are you holding up?
- I manage.

21:20.770 --> 21:24.149
It's really weird, isn't it? To think
this fuss is all because of you!

21:24.191 --> 21:28.445
I mean, not directly, but in some
six-degrees-of-Kevin Bacon way.

21:28.486 --> 21:33.742
Hallie, are you gonna bring your friend
to our little martini mixer tonight?

21:33.825 --> 21:37.245
- I have a lot of work to do.
- We'll be there.

21:37.329 --> 21:40.248
Oh, good. Because Sid,
we have our eyes on you.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.667
You hang in there, and if there's
anything we can do-

21:42.751 --> 21:46.254
The Delta Lambdas are very sensitive
to your plight.

21:46.338 --> 21:48.548
- Yeah. Bye!
- Bye!

21:50.467 --> 21:54.387
- You gonna start to dress like that once you get in?
- That's not gonna happen.

21:54.471 --> 21:57.474
The Delta Lambdas are the biggest
bunch of fuckin'-

21:57.557 --> 22:00.310
Hey! I'm pledging
Delta Lambda, thank you.

22:02.354 --> 22:04.731
Oh, my God.

22:07.359 --> 22:09.319
Who's that?

22:11.363 --> 22:13.281
Dewey?

22:13.365 --> 22:16.826
Hey!

22:16.910 --> 22:20.205
- What are you doing here?
- Ah!

22:20.247 --> 22:23.083
- Oh, I was worried about you.
- Yeah?

22:23.166 --> 22:25.252
I heard about what happened
and I was on the next plane.

22:25.335 --> 22:27.254
- Oh.
- Can we talk?

22:27.337 --> 22:29.256
Yeah. Yeah.

22:30.340 --> 22:32.259
Are you okay?

22:32.342 --> 22:36.096
I'm fine, Dewey,
or I was.

22:36.179 --> 22:39.933
I mean, things were okay
until now.

22:40.016 --> 22:43.061
But, uh,
theater's going great.

22:43.144 --> 22:46.356
I got my first starring role.
We open in two days.

22:46.398 --> 22:48.650
- That is great.
- Yeah. I'm loving it.

22:48.733 --> 22:50.652
You know, and I've got
some great friends,

22:50.735 --> 22:54.239
and, uh,
I'm seeing someone.

22:54.322 --> 22:58.368
Nice guy. Premed,
no apparent psychotic tendencies.

23:00.245 --> 23:02.205
I was just worried.

23:02.247 --> 23:08.128
Look, Sid, if there is some
freaked-out psycho trying to follow...

23:08.211 --> 23:11.715
in Billy Loomis's footsteps,
you probably already know him.

23:11.756 --> 23:15.218
Or her, or them.

23:15.302 --> 23:18.179
They're probably
already in your life.

23:18.263 --> 23:21.808
They get off on that.

23:21.892 --> 23:24.728
I just want you
to be careful, Sid.

23:28.440 --> 23:33.278
Oh, you- You think I don't
know that, Dewey?

23:33.361 --> 23:36.489
But what am I
supposed to do?

23:36.573 --> 23:40.869
Just cut everybody off?
Crawl under a rock? What?

23:44.122 --> 23:48.585
Just watch out.
Keep an eye out.

23:48.668 --> 23:51.922
I'm gonna talk to Chief Hartley
and the local police.

23:52.005 --> 23:55.091
I'm gonna
just hang around.

23:55.133 --> 23:59.012
I wanna make sure you're safe,
if that's all right with you.

23:59.095 --> 24:01.014
Yeah.
I'd be honored.

24:04.017 --> 24:06.353
All right, Sid.

24:14.945 --> 24:19.199
Hey.

24:19.282 --> 24:21.201
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

24:21.284 --> 24:23.203
- Who was that guy?
- An old friend.

24:23.286 --> 24:25.580
Deputy Dewey, Woodsboro's finest.
What's he doing here?

24:25.664 --> 24:28.583
He's worried.
Our surrogate big brother.

24:28.667 --> 24:31.419
Nothing like a funeral to bring
the family together.

24:31.503 --> 24:34.005
I'm gonna go say hi.

24:34.089 --> 24:38.051
- Chief Hartley said the girl
was stabbed seven- - Drop it.

24:38.134 --> 24:40.053
Hello, Sidney.

24:40.136 --> 24:43.807
- How are you?
- Hi. What do you want, Gale?

24:43.848 --> 24:47.394
Well, I was hoping I might get
just a few words with you.

24:49.896 --> 24:53.149
- Cotton.
- Hi, Sidney.

24:53.191 --> 24:55.485
Here we are at Windsor College,
where Sidney Prescott...

24:55.527 --> 24:58.238
has just been reunited with Cotton Weary
for the first time...

24:58.321 --> 25:00.824
since she wrongly accused
him of murdering her mother.

25:00.866 --> 25:03.743
- What the hell are you doing?
- We want to know how you feel.

25:03.827 --> 25:06.454
Tell us everything that's happened,
looking back on the last two years.

25:06.538 --> 25:09.916
Sidney, I'd just like to say
that I forgive and forget,

25:10.000 --> 25:13.086
and just like you, I'd like to get
back on with my own life.

25:13.169 --> 25:15.714
- Do you have any comments?
- You bitch!

25:15.797 --> 25:17.924
- Ah-ah.
- Deep breaths. Lot of deep breaths.

25:18.008 --> 25:20.677
Oh, Sidney,
share with us, please!

25:20.760 --> 25:23.013
- I'll share with you!
- Okay, okay, okay.

25:23.096 --> 25:25.056
Did you get that
on film?

25:25.098 --> 25:26.892
Yes, I got that
on film.

25:26.975 --> 25:29.227
Sid? Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

25:29.311 --> 25:31.855
Where's she going, Gale?
Sidney?

25:31.897 --> 25:34.024
Where's she going?

25:34.065 --> 25:36.026
Gale, I-I thought we had
an official interview.

25:36.067 --> 25:38.278
What's going on?
She didn't know?

25:38.361 --> 25:42.407
- Man, that was cold.
- Hey, you need to check your conscience at the door, sweetie.

25:42.490 --> 25:44.409
I'm not here
to be loved.

25:44.492 --> 25:46.411
Gale, you promised me ten minutes
of national coverage.

25:46.494 --> 25:48.413
You'll get
your ten minutes...

25:48.496 --> 25:51.541
when I get
my goddamn interview.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.960
Don't walk away from me, Gale.
I'm still-

25:54.044 --> 25:56.504
Gale, I did my part!

25:56.588 --> 25:58.506
Joel!

26:03.553 --> 26:06.097
Dewey.

26:06.181 --> 26:08.099
What are you
doing here?

26:08.183 --> 26:10.310
Why don't you just
leave her alone?

26:10.393 --> 26:12.521
Hasn't she been
through enough?

26:12.604 --> 26:16.066
And my name is Dwight.

26:16.149 --> 26:19.486
I was just doing my job,
Dwight.

26:19.569 --> 26:23.240
- No matter who gets hurt in the process?
- Hey!

26:23.281 --> 26:25.492
Who got punched here-
again?

26:25.575 --> 26:29.246
Well, I don't condone violence,
but maybe you deserved it.

26:29.287 --> 26:33.208
Page 32: "Deputy Dewey
filled the room...

26:33.291 --> 26:35.460
with his Barney Fife-ish
presence."

26:35.544 --> 26:37.879
You read my book.

26:37.963 --> 26:40.048
Oh, yes, I do read,
Miss Weathers.

26:40.131 --> 26:43.093
Oh, Dewey, don't take it so seriously.
It's a character in a book.

26:43.134 --> 26:46.846
Page 41:

26:46.930 --> 26:50.976
"Deputy Dewey oozed
with inexperience."

26:52.811 --> 26:55.313
Don't you think you're overreacting
just a little bit?

26:55.355 --> 27:00.986
No. What I think is that you're a money-hungry,
fame-seeking- and forgive me for saying-

27:01.069 --> 27:05.240
mediocre writer who's got a cold storage
shed where her heart should be.

27:05.323 --> 27:07.450
No offense intended.

27:07.492 --> 27:09.452
Dewey, I never meant
to imply-

27:09.494 --> 27:11.580
How do you know that my
dimwitted inexperience isn't...

27:11.663 --> 27:15.375
merely a subtle form of manipulation
used to lower people's expectations,

27:15.458 --> 27:20.672
enhancing my ability to effectively
maneuver within any given situation?

27:28.972 --> 27:31.808
I'm sorry.

27:33.894 --> 27:36.229
I don't know
what else to say...

27:36.313 --> 27:39.482
except I'm sorry.

27:39.566 --> 27:43.153
No. I'm the one
that's sorry.

27:43.195 --> 27:45.322
I misjudged you.

27:45.405 --> 27:48.074
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

27:48.158 --> 27:50.744
I have some oozing to do.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.915
One more thing.

27:54.998 --> 27:56.917
Nice streaks.

27:59.169 --> 28:01.087
Well.

28:12.891 --> 28:14.851
Hey, I am not
a sorority pusher.

28:14.893 --> 28:16.853
I just think,
despite its trivialities,

28:16.895 --> 28:21.274
it is a life-affirming, mentally stable,
healthy environment for you.

28:21.358 --> 28:24.277
I mean,
look at this place.

28:24.361 --> 28:27.239
I think you're taking your psych major
a little too seriously, Hallie.

28:27.322 --> 28:29.533
I'm fine.

28:29.574 --> 28:32.160
Yeah? That's beginning
to become your theme song.

28:32.244 --> 28:35.622
"I'm fine." Yeah- Fucked up,
insecure, neurotic and emotional.

28:35.705 --> 28:37.749
Sidney, you made it!

28:37.832 --> 28:40.794
Hi!
No, I really mean that.

28:40.877 --> 28:42.796
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:42.879 --> 28:44.881
Do you girls
want a drink?

28:44.923 --> 28:49.761
Uh, well, actually, yeah, but
you know what? We'll get it ourselves.

28:57.727 --> 29:01.439
I love those guys.
Are they still together?

29:01.523 --> 29:03.441
I haven't seen it
in, like, three weeks.

29:03.525 --> 29:05.443
- No, they broke up again.
- Really?

29:05.527 --> 29:07.445
Mm-hmm. Sarah found out
that Bailey slept with Gwen.

29:07.529 --> 29:09.489
She dumped him, like,
two episodes ago.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.491
I wish she'd get
her shit together.

29:11.575 --> 29:14.536
- Hold on. Someone's calling.

29:14.619 --> 29:16.538
Omega Beta Zeta.

29:16.621 --> 29:18.540
Hello?

29:18.623 --> 29:21.251
- Yes?
- Who is this?

29:21.293 --> 29:24.296
- Cici. Who's this?
- Who do you think?

29:24.337 --> 29:26.798
Ted?
Where are you?

29:26.840 --> 29:29.593
Are you drinking?
Hold on.

29:29.676 --> 29:33.346
Ted's on the other line.
He sounds drunk. I'll call you back.

29:33.430 --> 29:35.515
That shit only calls you
when he's drunk.

29:35.599 --> 29:38.518
- Don't go over there, Cici.
- All right. I'll call you back.

29:41.897 --> 29:44.441
Okay, Ted. You sound loaded.
What's up?

29:44.524 --> 29:46.484
Who's Ted?

29:46.526 --> 29:49.029
Oh, I'm sorry.
My bad.

29:49.112 --> 29:51.031
I thought you were
someone else.

29:51.114 --> 29:53.033
That's okay.
I am.

29:53.116 --> 29:55.577
Who are you calling for?
Nobody's here.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.579
Where is everybody?

29:57.662 --> 30:00.916
We're cosponsoring the acid rain mixer
at Phi Gamma Alpha tonight.

30:00.999 --> 30:03.835
- Why aren't you there?
- I'm "sober sister."

30:03.919 --> 30:06.588
I need to be here in case
a drunk sister calls and needs a ride.

30:06.671 --> 30:10.008
- That's too bad.
- "Drink with your brain." That's our motto.

30:10.050 --> 30:13.011
- Who are you calling for?
- What if I said you?

30:13.094 --> 30:16.306
What if I said good-bye?

30:16.348 --> 30:18.475
Why would you
want to do that?

30:20.185 --> 30:24.147
- Why do you always answer a question with a question?
- I'm inquisitive.

30:24.189 --> 30:29.069
Yeah, and I'm impatient. Do you want
to leave a message for someone?

30:29.152 --> 30:32.239
Do you want to die
tonight, Cici?

30:38.703 --> 30:40.747
Omega Beta Zeta.

30:40.830 --> 30:42.749
So, was it Teddy?

30:42.832 --> 30:45.544
No. It was some creep asshole
trying to scare me.

30:45.627 --> 30:47.921
That movie Stab is
bringing out the crazies.

30:50.590 --> 30:53.260
- Shit.
- What is it?

30:53.343 --> 30:55.303
- I heard a noise.
- Where?

30:55.387 --> 30:57.347
Upstairs.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.600
- Shit!

31:02.978 --> 31:07.190
- Hello? Hello?
- Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

31:07.274 --> 31:09.317
- Die, die, die, die, die. - Stop it!

31:09.401 --> 31:11.862
I can't believe you're alone
in that house.

31:11.903 --> 31:13.864
- I don't think I'm alone.

31:15.282 --> 31:17.242
I'm out of here.

31:23.748 --> 31:26.084
You're breaking up.
Where are you?

31:26.126 --> 31:28.879
- Outside.
- Don't panic, Cici.

31:28.962 --> 31:31.882
- Call campus security.
- Okay.

31:37.262 --> 31:39.848
Campus Security.

31:39.931 --> 31:42.767
- Hi. I'm calling from the Omega Beta-
- I can't hear you. Hello?

31:42.851 --> 31:45.061
Hello?

31:45.103 --> 31:47.731
- Can you hear me now?
- Hello?

31:47.772 --> 31:49.983
- Hello? Shit!

31:54.821 --> 31:56.781
- Campus Security.
- Yes. I'm calling from-

31:56.823 --> 31:58.909
I can't hear you.
Hello?

31:58.950 --> 32:02.162
- I'm calling from Omega Beta Zeta house.

32:02.245 --> 32:04.164
Look, someone
is harassing me.

32:04.247 --> 32:06.166
- Hello? Shit!

32:06.249 --> 32:08.168
- Hey!

32:08.251 --> 32:10.420
- Jesus, Dawnie, you scared me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:10.503 --> 32:12.464
Did anyone call for me?

32:12.505 --> 32:16.092
- What are you doing here?
- I live here, remember?

32:16.134 --> 32:18.428
I just thought you were
going to the mixer.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.389
Yeah, I am. I had to change,
so I'll be out of here now.

32:24.809 --> 32:26.853
Omega Beta Zeta.

32:26.937 --> 32:29.439
- Is Cici there?
- Mm-hmm. Who's calling?

32:29.523 --> 32:33.401
- It's Ted.
- It's your ill-conceived boyfriend.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.570
Okay, so, I'll
see you later.

32:35.654 --> 32:39.032
And don't forget
to set the alarm.

32:39.115 --> 32:41.034
Bye.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.667
Hello, Ted.

32:48.750 --> 32:53.421
Wish it was Ted. Don't forget
to set the alarm.

34:20.717 --> 34:22.636
Hello?

35:00.882 --> 35:02.842
No! Please, no!

35:02.926 --> 35:07.806
- No!

35:09.516 --> 35:12.519
Never said I was innocent

35:12.602 --> 35:15.897
I will burn in hell
for the things I've done to you

35:15.981 --> 35:18.942
Never said
I was anything good

35:23.405 --> 35:25.824
Everyone thinks that sororities
are just about blow jobs,

35:25.907 --> 35:29.995
- but it's not true.
- We only promote safe, condomed sex.

35:30.078 --> 35:32.789
See, we're about love,
respect and responsibility.

35:32.873 --> 35:35.083
Harmonica style
is okay, right?

35:35.166 --> 35:37.085
- Oh, yeah.
- Cocktail?

35:37.168 --> 35:39.254
What took you so long?

35:39.337 --> 35:41.673
And you know, Derek is
a Delta Lambda big brother.

35:41.756 --> 35:44.551
And we like to keep it
all in the family.

35:44.634 --> 35:48.054
Wow. You know, you girls have
really given me a lot to think about.

35:48.138 --> 35:50.056
Thanks.

35:50.140 --> 35:52.309
It's working.
It's working.

35:52.350 --> 35:55.103
- Hey, babe. You wanna dance?
- Oh, I'd love to...

35:55.187 --> 35:58.815
with that tall, wide-shouldered
fraternity boy.

35:58.899 --> 36:01.860
- Think you can arrange that?
- That hurts.

36:01.902 --> 36:06.156
The Empire Strikes Back. It
was a better story, improved effects.

36:06.198 --> 36:08.658
Not a sequel. It was part of a trilogy.
Completely planned.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.660
I like those
little furry things.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.662
They're Ewoks.
They blow.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.664
Hey.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.666
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.669
- Twits being nice to you?
- Painfully nice.

36:19.711 --> 36:22.672
I take it you will not be pledging
Delta Lambda Zeta.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.217
I think not.

36:25.258 --> 36:27.844
- I'm crushed.
- Hey, guys.

36:27.928 --> 36:29.888
Something is up
at Omega Beta Zeta.

36:29.930 --> 36:32.682
- Police are everywhere.
- Hurry!

36:32.766 --> 36:36.019
Come on, let's go!

36:52.786 --> 36:54.746
- Way to break up the party!
- Shit!

36:54.788 --> 36:56.748
I should have brought
my drink.

37:04.214 --> 37:06.925
Death by blunt trauma,
and there's a double stabbing.

37:07.008 --> 37:09.678
So it's definitely
not suicide.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.721
Okay.
Thank you.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.895
Gale, hi. You're just getting here.
It's not good.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.064
It's a single victim:
Sorority girl.

37:21.147 --> 37:24.234
So- I gotta go.
I've got a deadline.

37:27.445 --> 37:31.283
- Joel, let's go.
- In-In a minute.

37:31.324 --> 37:33.827
It's happening again,
isn't it?

37:33.910 --> 37:35.829
You'd love that,
wouldn't you?

37:35.912 --> 37:38.874
- Please, stay back.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.335
Better hurry, Gale.
Might get scooped.

37:42.419 --> 37:44.337
Come on, I'm just trying
to get close enough...

37:44.421 --> 37:46.715
- to get a shot.
- Move it, Joel.

37:48.216 --> 37:52.429
Gale, I have to be honest with you.
I'm not cut out for this.

37:52.512 --> 37:56.516
I mean, I was brought here to do
an interview, not Faces of Death 14.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.685
Do not fuck with me.

38:11.156 --> 38:13.116
Come on.
Get your jacket.

38:13.158 --> 38:15.118
Let's get you home.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.120
Yeah.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.946
- You about ready?

38:56.034 --> 38:57.953
Almost.

39:02.165 --> 39:05.168
- Hello?
- Hello, Sidney.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.420
Remember me?

39:07.504 --> 39:12.509
- What do you want?
- I want you. It's show time.

39:12.551 --> 39:15.428
Then why don't you show your face,
you fucking coward.

39:15.512 --> 39:17.430
- My pleasure.

39:17.514 --> 39:19.266
Derek!

39:20.809 --> 39:23.728
- Sid? Sid?

39:24.813 --> 39:26.565
Derek!

39:26.648 --> 39:29.067
- Sid?

39:31.736 --> 39:33.321
Sid!

39:46.585 --> 39:48.545
- It's me. It's me.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.590
- You okay? You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:51.631 --> 39:53.717
No, Derek!
Don't!

39:53.800 --> 39:55.760
Sid!

39:55.802 --> 39:57.762
Dewey!

39:57.804 --> 39:59.764
- The killer's in there. And Derek.

40:15.071 --> 40:17.866
- You all right?
- He went that way.

40:17.949 --> 40:20.076
Sidney, he's in here!

40:24.789 --> 40:26.708
Is everything okay?

40:29.377 --> 40:33.298
He got me. He got me.

40:36.801 --> 40:38.762
- Now, apply pressure to it.
- Don't do that-

40:42.974 --> 40:45.393
The police are on their way.

40:54.903 --> 40:57.030
Thanks for your cooperation.

40:57.113 --> 40:59.282
Hallie, I'll be with you
in a few minutes, okay?

40:59.366 --> 41:01.701
Uh, no problem.

41:01.785 --> 41:05.914
That's the easiest interrogation
of my crime-filled life.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.959
I'm gonna go get a quick cup of coffee.
You want?

41:09.042 --> 41:11.419
No.

41:11.503 --> 41:13.421
You want some, Sid?

41:16.967 --> 41:19.177
How you doin'?
You all right?

41:19.261 --> 41:21.179
Not at all.

41:22.764 --> 41:25.183
You know, I knew
this was coming.

41:25.267 --> 41:29.604
- I knew this wasn't over.
- You are not alone, Sid.

41:29.688 --> 41:32.357
Okay?
We are all here for you.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.526
All right?
Whatever you need.

41:36.027 --> 41:39.197
- That poor girl.
- I know.

41:39.281 --> 41:41.366
It's crazy, but-

41:41.449 --> 41:45.287
- Derek could've been killed, you know.
- But he wasn't.

41:45.370 --> 41:50.250
He's fine.
He just needs to realize...

41:50.333 --> 41:52.711
the '90s is no time
to play hero.

41:52.794 --> 41:54.713
Why would anyone go back
in that house anyway?

41:59.259 --> 42:02.262
I went around to the back of the house
and ran into Sid there.

42:02.345 --> 42:05.390
That's when she told me the killer
was inside, so I went in to see.

42:05.473 --> 42:08.560
- You're lucky there's no nerve damage.

42:08.643 --> 42:11.188
You're gonna have
to take it easy though.

42:11.229 --> 42:15.317
- So then you went back inside the house?
- Yeah.

42:15.400 --> 42:18.236
No struggle? He just cut you
and ran away?

42:18.320 --> 42:22.657
- You're lucky he didn't kill you.
- Yeah, it's awfully convenient.

42:22.741 --> 42:26.703
- Say what?
- Nothing.

42:26.745 --> 42:28.788
It's just a shame
he got away so easily.

42:28.872 --> 42:31.541
It's just a shame
you got there too late,

42:31.583 --> 42:33.835
right after he disappeared.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.759
Yeah, it is.

43:00.278 --> 43:02.197
We got three victims.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.825
Maureen Evans,
Phil Stevens...

43:05.909 --> 43:08.703
and Cici Cooper.

43:08.787 --> 43:12.290
- Is Cici the girl's real name?
- Oh, uh, no.

43:12.374 --> 43:15.210
It's, uh, Casey.
Casey Cooper.

43:17.754 --> 43:20.423
As in Casey Becker?

43:20.465 --> 43:24.594
- Excuse me?
- She was a young victim in Woodsboro.

43:24.678 --> 43:28.640
As well as her boyfriend,
Steven Orth.

43:28.682 --> 43:30.767
As in Phil Stevens.

43:30.851 --> 43:34.646
Maureen Evans- Maureen Prescott.
That's Sidney's mother.

43:34.729 --> 43:37.691
Do you think someone's
trying to duplicate Woodsboro?

43:37.774 --> 43:40.151
It looks like it.

43:42.821 --> 43:44.990
I think you have a copycat
on your hands, Chief.

43:45.073 --> 43:47.534
Jesus Christ!

43:47.617 --> 43:49.578
What are you doing
to keep Sidney safe?

43:49.661 --> 43:52.873
I got my two best
detectives guarding her.

43:52.956 --> 43:56.334
Do these guys have to follow
you around everywhere?

43:56.418 --> 43:58.920
Oh. We're attached
at the hip.

43:59.004 --> 44:01.673
- How am I ever gonna get you alone?

44:01.756 --> 44:05.677
- You know, to be honest, Derek,

44:05.760 --> 44:09.139
I think it would probably be
in your best interest to...

44:09.181 --> 44:12.017
stay as far away
from me as possible.

44:13.852 --> 44:15.854
I hope that was an
off-the-cuff remark...

44:15.937 --> 44:19.191
that holds no
subtext whatsoever.

44:19.274 --> 44:23.195
No, actually.
I mean it.

44:26.364 --> 44:30.243
I mean, look at you.
You already got hurt.

44:30.327 --> 44:33.121
I don't want to see
that happen again.

44:33.205 --> 44:35.123
I'll take my chances.

44:35.207 --> 44:38.168
Derek, I'm serious.

44:38.251 --> 44:40.545
This is serious.

44:42.923 --> 44:46.885
You are concerned with my
personal well-being and...

44:48.595 --> 44:53.099
not with trusting me
or anything, right?

44:57.145 --> 44:59.064
Like I said, I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

44:59.147 --> 45:02.734
And I don't want
to see you get hurt.

45:02.817 --> 45:04.736
Okay, Sid?

45:16.623 --> 45:18.792
- Take care, Miss Weathers.
- All right.

45:21.586 --> 45:24.130
- Dewey.
- Chief.

45:25.382 --> 45:27.300
Hi.

45:27.384 --> 45:30.846
So, I'm heading over to admissions
to do some leg work. You game?

45:30.929 --> 45:33.515
I'm not here to write
a book, Miss Weathers.

45:33.598 --> 45:35.517
I'm here to help Sid.

45:37.561 --> 45:40.272
I want to help her, too.

45:40.355 --> 45:43.316
And help myself,
of course.

45:45.318 --> 45:49.573
Come on, Dewey. Smile just once.
Please?

45:51.408 --> 45:53.326
I'll smile when
I catch the killer.

45:56.913 --> 45:58.832
Gale, hi. So who
do you think did it?

45:58.915 --> 46:01.334
What about Sidney's father?
Has he been ruled out as a suspect?

46:01.418 --> 46:03.336
Well, he's supposedly out of the country
on business,

46:03.420 --> 46:05.338
but that sounds a little fishy,
don't you think?

46:05.422 --> 46:08.550
- I'm not here to do your job, Miss Salt.
- What about this ex-cop, Dewey?

46:08.633 --> 46:10.969
- It's kind of strange that he showed up.
- Yeah, what's he doing here?

46:11.052 --> 46:14.264
Dewey's a good guy,
unlike some of us.

46:16.349 --> 46:18.810
Really?

46:18.852 --> 46:21.438
Well, it just seems to me that
if the killer is repeating...

46:21.479 --> 46:23.523
what happened in Woodsboro,
it's quite possible that the killer...

46:23.607 --> 46:25.525
could be from Woodsboro.

46:25.609 --> 46:27.527
That's all.

46:29.404 --> 46:33.450
Derek, you think Sid will let me
interview her for my documentary?

46:33.491 --> 46:37.954
Oh, yeah. You know, she turned down
Primetime Live, 20/20 and Dateline.

46:38.038 --> 46:40.582
- But for you, yeah.
- Drop it.

46:40.665 --> 46:43.084
I've been thinking about
this whole murder thing.

46:43.168 --> 46:45.337
- Have they checked out Randy?
- What?

46:45.420 --> 46:48.632
I know he's an innocent victim the first
time around, but he's a little off.

46:48.715 --> 46:52.469
- You know what I'm saying?
- Come on. Randy? The guy's harmless.

46:52.511 --> 46:55.013
- That's what they said about Dahmer.
- Guys, keep it down.

46:55.096 --> 46:57.140
Come on.
What's up, Sid?

46:57.224 --> 47:00.101
- Hey, Sid.
- How's it goin'?

47:00.185 --> 47:02.187
Where are
the Secret Service guys?

47:02.270 --> 47:04.189
Uh, over there.

47:05.815 --> 47:07.776
And which one
is Kevin Costner?

47:07.859 --> 47:10.737
The one on the right
is Officer Richards.

47:10.820 --> 47:13.949
He is a Capricorn.
Divorced. Father of two.

47:14.032 --> 47:18.578
And the one on the left
is Officer Andrews. He is a Gemini.

47:18.662 --> 47:20.872
He's single,
but I think he's gay.

47:20.956 --> 47:23.416
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

47:23.500 --> 47:25.544
Derek?
Penny for your thoughts.

47:28.672 --> 47:32.676
"This morning, I woke up
with this feeling...

47:32.759 --> 47:35.720
I didn't know
how to deal with."

47:35.804 --> 47:39.432
And so I just
decided to myself

47:39.516 --> 47:42.018
I'd hide it to myself

47:42.102 --> 47:44.062
- What is he doing?

47:44.104 --> 47:47.190
Uh, Tom Cruise,
Top Gun, 1986.

47:47.232 --> 47:50.235
- Derek, don't.
- When you walked into the room

47:50.277 --> 47:52.571
- I think I love you
- Don't do this.

47:52.654 --> 47:56.825
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

47:56.908 --> 48:00.412
And though
it worries me to say

48:00.495 --> 48:03.415
- I've never felt this way, hey

48:03.456 --> 48:07.836
I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

48:07.919 --> 48:11.756
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for

48:13.633 --> 48:16.970
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

48:17.053 --> 48:19.264
- And though it worries me to say

48:19.347 --> 48:22.434
- I've never felt this way

48:22.517 --> 48:25.937
Believe me
You really don't have to worry

48:25.979 --> 48:28.231
I only wanna
make you happy

48:28.273 --> 48:30.483
And if you say
"Hey, go away"

48:30.567 --> 48:33.445
I will
But I think better still

48:33.528 --> 48:35.947
I better stick around
and love you

48:35.989 --> 48:39.367
Do you think I have a case
Let me ask you to your face

48:39.451 --> 48:42.621
Do you really love me
'Cause I think

48:42.704 --> 48:46.625
I love you

48:59.054 --> 49:01.890
Let's show
a little love, huh?

49:08.772 --> 49:10.690
Come on.
Come here, come here.

49:12.567 --> 49:16.947
Don't worry, Sid.
I know things are a little crazy.

49:18.657 --> 49:21.701
Isn't that a big
frat faux pas?

49:21.785 --> 49:23.745
Oh, yeah.
That is a big no-no.

49:23.828 --> 49:26.289
See, you're not supposed to give
your Greek letters to your girl...

49:26.373 --> 49:28.333
no shape, way or form.

49:28.375 --> 49:30.335
The brothers are gonna kick his ass,
but it's tradition.

49:30.377 --> 49:33.880
- It's tradition.
- It's good luck.

49:33.964 --> 49:36.007
It'll protect you.

49:50.647 --> 49:53.733
So, tell us about this part
you're getting rave reviews for.

49:53.817 --> 49:56.278
Well, I play this young girl,
Sidney Prescott,

49:56.361 --> 49:59.823
who discovers that her boyfriend
is this crazy serial killer...

49:59.906 --> 50:01.950
who also killed her mother
the year before that.

50:02.033 --> 50:04.119
So what kind of research
did you do for the part?

50:04.202 --> 50:07.330
I don't get it. They get
Tori Spelling to play Sid,

50:07.414 --> 50:09.875
and they cast Joe Blow Nobody
to play me.

50:09.958 --> 50:12.669
- At least you get David Schwimmer.

50:12.752 --> 50:14.838
I get the guy who drove
Jane Seymore's stagecoach...

50:14.880 --> 50:17.632
for one episode
of Doctor Quinn.

50:17.716 --> 50:20.927
This is Tori Spelling
starring in the new film Stab.

50:26.391 --> 50:29.477
Billy, you scared me.

50:29.561 --> 50:32.647
- What are you doing here?
- They let me go, Sid. I didn't do it.

50:32.731 --> 50:34.983
- I'm innocent.
- I know.

50:35.066 --> 50:37.736
- Please.
- Why won't you let me touch you?

50:39.779 --> 50:44.326
Look, I've been going through a lot
lately, Billy. And with my mom-

50:44.409 --> 50:48.371
Sid, I think you need
to just deal with that and move on.

50:48.455 --> 50:50.999
I mean, when my mom
left my dad, I accepted it.

50:51.082 --> 50:54.669
That's the way
the cookie crumbles. Moms leave.

50:54.753 --> 50:59.382
Yeah, your mom left town. She's not
buried in the cemetery somewhere.

50:59.466 --> 51:02.552
My mom's dead, and she's
never coming back. Ever.

51:05.931 --> 51:09.142
- Stupid.
- Ooh, I love scary movies.

51:09.226 --> 51:12.020
I'll wait for video. Okay,
let's get down to business.

51:12.103 --> 51:14.147
The way I see it,
someone's out to make a sequel.

51:14.231 --> 51:16.316
You know, cash in on all
the movie murder hoopla.

51:16.399 --> 51:19.194
So it's our job to observe
the rules of the sequel.

51:19.277 --> 51:21.863
Number one: The body count
is always bigger.

51:21.947 --> 51:26.409
Two: The death scenes are always much
more elaborate; more blood, more gore.

51:26.451 --> 51:29.371
Carnage candy. Your core audience
just expects it.

51:29.454 --> 51:33.458
And three: If you want your sequel
to become a franchise, never ever-

51:33.542 --> 51:35.794
How do we find the killer, Randy?
That's what I wanna know.

51:35.877 --> 51:38.421
Oh. Let's look
at the suspects.

51:38.505 --> 51:41.758
There's Derek, the obvious boyfriend.
Hello, Billy Loomis.

51:41.800 --> 51:44.177
The guy's premed, and his
pity-me surface wound...

51:44.261 --> 51:46.972
conveniently missed every major vein
and artery.

51:47.055 --> 51:50.392
- So you think it's Derek?
- Not so fast.

51:50.475 --> 51:52.811
Let's assume the killer,
or 'ers, has a half a brain.

51:52.894 --> 51:55.146
He's not a Nick At Night
rerun type of guy.

51:55.230 --> 51:57.148
He wants to break
some new ground.

51:57.232 --> 51:59.401
- Right? So forget the boyfriend.
- Right.

51:59.484 --> 52:01.903
- It's tired. Who else do we got?
- There's-

52:01.987 --> 52:04.823
Mickey, the freaky
Tarantino film student.

52:06.741 --> 52:10.203
But if he's a suspect, so am I.
So, let's move on.

52:10.287 --> 52:12.205
Whoa, wait a-
Let's not move on.

52:12.289 --> 52:14.833
Maybe you are a suspect.

52:14.916 --> 52:17.627
Well, if I'm a suspect,
you're a suspect.

52:19.629 --> 52:22.716
You have a point.

52:22.799 --> 52:25.343
Okay, let's move on to-

52:25.427 --> 52:27.554
- Hallie.
- Sid's roommate?

52:27.637 --> 52:30.682
- Uh-huh. - Serial killers
are typically white males.

52:30.765 --> 52:34.394
That's why it's perfect. It's sort of
against the rules, but not really.

52:34.477 --> 52:37.397
Mrs. Voorhees was
a terrific serial killer.

52:37.480 --> 52:39.733
And there's always room
for Candyman's daughter.

52:39.816 --> 52:42.569
She's sweet. She's deadly.
She's bad for your teeth.

52:45.697 --> 52:48.366
Come on, Randy.
These kids are your friends.

52:48.450 --> 52:50.785
Who do you think's
the killer?

52:50.869 --> 52:54.164
- How about Gale Weathers?
- Gale? A killer?

52:54.247 --> 52:58.293
- Why not?
- Well, she is vicious enough.

52:58.376 --> 53:00.754
- She's an opportunist.
- Yeah.

53:00.837 --> 53:03.173
Isn't it conceivable
she's planning her next book?

53:03.215 --> 53:06.760
That's what reporters do, Dewey.
They stage the news.

53:06.843 --> 53:09.763
No. Gale's a lot of things,
but Gale's not a killer.

53:09.846 --> 53:12.599
- Just because you're sweet on her-
- No, I'm not.

53:12.682 --> 53:14.684
Please, this is me talking.
Randy,

53:14.768 --> 53:17.145
the unrequited love-slave
of Sidney Prescott.

53:17.229 --> 53:19.814
I know all
about obsession...

53:19.898 --> 53:21.816
and pain.

53:21.900 --> 53:25.278
- You've got your love scar to prove it.
- And so do you.

53:25.362 --> 53:28.323
And what's with that limp anyway,
'cause you were stabbed in the back.

53:28.406 --> 53:31.952
Severed nerve.
Look, Gale's no killer.

53:33.078 --> 53:35.705
Okay, okay.
Whatever you say.

53:35.747 --> 53:38.959
But if she's not a killer,
she's a target.

53:41.086 --> 53:43.129
Joel, let's get
some establishing shots.

53:43.213 --> 53:45.215
Um, Gale,
can we talk for a sec?

53:45.257 --> 53:47.634
- What is it?
- Look, I'm a little confused here.

53:47.717 --> 53:49.761
I mean, with your
given track record,

53:49.845 --> 53:51.972
why would you wanna be here
when the killer strikes again?

53:52.055 --> 53:55.433
I mean, granted, I should've read
your book before I took this job.

53:55.475 --> 53:57.644
But I'm reading it now,
and- Whoo!

53:57.727 --> 53:59.688
I read what happened
to your last cameraman.

53:59.771 --> 54:02.440
The guy got gutted.
Now, me,

54:02.524 --> 54:04.568
I'm gonna do what any
rational human being would do,

54:04.651 --> 54:06.611
which is get the fuck
out of here.

54:06.653 --> 54:08.905
First of all, he wasn't gutted.
I made that up.

54:08.989 --> 54:10.949
His throat was slashed.

54:10.991 --> 54:13.076
What are you-
Gale, gutted, slashed,

54:13.159 --> 54:15.120
the guy ain't in
the union no more.

54:15.161 --> 54:17.122
It's a job, Joel.

54:17.163 --> 54:19.416
And like every job,
there's a few drawbacks.

54:19.499 --> 54:23.044
But you're a professional cameraman.
You've got to act like one.

54:23.128 --> 54:25.547
Yeah, but I wanna report the news.
I don't wanna be the news.

54:25.630 --> 54:28.383
Besides, brothers don't last long
in situations like this.

54:28.466 --> 54:32.304
This is national television.
Think about it.

54:32.387 --> 54:34.306
This is a big chance
for you.

54:34.389 --> 54:37.184
The story is monumental.
Don't you wanna be a part of that?

54:38.268 --> 54:40.020
Come on.

54:40.103 --> 54:43.565
I need you.
I cannot do this without you.

54:46.526 --> 54:48.486
Good.
Come on.

54:48.528 --> 54:51.865
- Let's get some work done.
- Yeah, let's go get killed.

54:55.035 --> 54:58.830
We've been through this before. You know what
I think about your potential as an actress.

54:58.997 --> 55:00.790
I know.
I know.

55:00.957 --> 55:03.960
It-It's just that with,
um, the murders...

55:04.002 --> 55:07.422
and the movie
and my life-

55:07.464 --> 55:10.217
I do know how difficult
it is for you.

55:11.885 --> 55:14.638
Gus, I-I just-
I don't think I can do it.

55:14.763 --> 55:18.600
The battle for the soul is
fought in the forum of art.

55:18.683 --> 55:22.020
You're a fighter, Sid. That's why you're
here. That's why this is your major.

55:22.103 --> 55:24.439
- Yeah, I'm a fighter.
- I didn't hear that.

55:26.149 --> 55:29.027
- I'm a fighter.
- I don't believe you.

55:31.571 --> 55:33.532
I don't.

55:35.367 --> 55:38.036
I'm a fighter.

55:38.119 --> 55:40.038
Okay.

55:42.123 --> 55:45.335
So, at the risk of sounding
like a college drama teacher,

55:45.377 --> 55:48.380
if you've got pain around
this kind of material, use it.

55:48.421 --> 55:51.049
This is your role, Sid.

55:51.132 --> 55:54.553
Cassandra is one of the great tragic
visionaries of literature.

55:54.636 --> 55:58.223
She saw it all coming.
The wars,

55:58.306 --> 56:01.393
the murder,
the madness.

56:03.144 --> 56:05.856
She knew
she was cursed.

56:05.939 --> 56:08.984
It was her fate,
and she embraced it.

56:09.067 --> 56:13.822
None of us can avoid our fate,
but as an artist...

56:13.905 --> 56:16.533
you can honestly face it...

56:16.575 --> 56:18.535
and fight it.

56:22.414 --> 56:25.375
- You're good.
- There's no understudy. I'm desperate.

56:29.671 --> 56:31.673
You can do this.

56:36.928 --> 56:40.098
Okay, everybody. Gather around.
Third Act, one last time.

56:40.182 --> 56:43.018
Cue the music.

56:55.488 --> 56:59.701
All behold the dreaded
fate of Troy...

56:59.784 --> 57:04.789
that once stood proud and light
upon the hills of Sparta!

57:04.873 --> 57:09.544
Now shrouded in
the deathly smoke of ruin,

57:09.628 --> 57:13.632
her royal children
pitched from her walls,

57:13.715 --> 57:18.470
her people driven
through her ruins.

57:18.553 --> 57:23.975
And now alone in
fate's cruel isolation...

57:24.017 --> 57:26.478
stands Cassandra,

57:26.561 --> 57:30.774
her kingdom,
family and friends...

57:30.815 --> 57:33.693
driven to the wind.

57:35.195 --> 57:39.950
- No crime against gods or man...

57:39.991 --> 57:41.910
have I committed,

57:41.993 --> 57:45.163
saith to speak
the truth.

57:45.247 --> 57:49.626
And each hideous vision
born from my mind...

57:49.668 --> 57:52.629
has come to pass.

57:52.671 --> 57:55.674
Troy has fallen,

57:55.715 --> 57:59.469
not by my hand
or wish,

58:00.637 --> 58:02.556
but as I foresaw.

58:06.935 --> 58:10.397
So now,
fate's vengeful eye...

58:10.480 --> 58:12.440
is fixed...

58:14.359 --> 58:17.779
on me.

58:17.863 --> 58:21.324
Tell us, O Cassandra,
where has the sweetness...

58:21.366 --> 58:23.493
of life gone?

58:23.535 --> 58:27.289
What stays fate's hand
from striking now at thee?

58:27.372 --> 58:29.708
What stays fate's hand
from thee?

58:29.791 --> 58:32.377
What stays fate's hand
from thee?

58:32.460 --> 58:34.379
What stays fate's hand
from thee?

58:34.462 --> 58:37.007
What stays fate's hand
from thee?

58:57.736 --> 59:02.157
All right, hold it.
Hold it!

59:04.326 --> 59:07.162
Everyone, take five.

59:21.551 --> 59:24.429
Sidney?

59:36.024 --> 59:39.778
Sid.
Your escort has arrived.

59:39.861 --> 59:42.531
- Derek, how long have you been here?
- I just got here.

59:42.614 --> 59:45.450
- Is everything okay? What's goin' on?
- What happened to Mickey?

59:45.534 --> 59:48.453
We swapped. He had to edit.
You get me instead. What happened?

59:48.537 --> 59:51.414
Derek, don't.

59:53.500 --> 59:57.212
Don't. I-I just need to be alone
right now, okay?

59:59.631 --> 01:00:02.133
Being alone is not
the answer, Sid.

01:00:02.217 --> 01:00:06.346
Yeah, well,
I think it is.

01:00:06.429 --> 01:00:09.224
I need some distance.

01:00:12.811 --> 01:00:14.729
Well, do I
get a say in this?

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:19.150
No.

01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:28.118
I guess I'm supposed
to be... understanding.

01:00:29.411 --> 01:00:32.747
Yeah.

01:00:37.669 --> 01:00:39.588
You got it.

01:00:47.512 --> 01:00:50.640
All right. Let's just assume the killer
is repeating Woodsboro-

01:00:50.724 --> 01:00:52.809
- Yes?

01:00:52.851 --> 01:00:55.103
- I have Bob calling.
- I'll have to call you back.

01:00:55.187 --> 01:00:57.898
That doesn't
explain Sidney's attack.

01:00:57.981 --> 01:01:00.483
Sidney wasn't killed
in Woodsboro.

01:01:00.567 --> 01:01:02.652
Wasn't for
a lack of trying.

01:01:02.736 --> 01:01:05.071
The killer's trying
to finish what was started.

01:01:05.155 --> 01:01:07.282
- Sid's under protection, right?
- Yeah.

01:01:07.365 --> 01:01:09.618
- What?

01:01:09.701 --> 01:01:12.204
- Bob really needs to talk to you-
- Tell Bob I'll call him back.

01:01:12.287 --> 01:01:15.707
- When'd she start smoking?
- Ever since those nude pictures on the internet.

01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:17.959
It was just my head.
It was Jennifer Aniston's body.

01:01:18.043 --> 01:01:20.045
Anyway, you're
forgetting something.

01:01:20.128 --> 01:01:22.839
In Woodsboro, there were more victims
before the homestretch-

01:01:22.881 --> 01:01:25.217
Tatum, my cameraman,
Himbry-

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:29.721
Time out! I don't need to be hearing
about no dead cameramen, all right?

01:01:29.804 --> 01:01:32.474
Now, I'm warning you guys. I am a verb
away from vacatin' these premises.

01:01:32.557 --> 01:01:36.186
I'm gonna get me some coffee,
donuts, Prozac,

01:01:36.269 --> 01:01:38.772
see if I can find some crack,
Special K- "X," not Malcolm-

01:01:38.855 --> 01:01:41.983
and I'll be back when you guys
start talking about something...

01:01:42.067 --> 01:01:44.528
a little more Saved By The Bell-ish,
all right?

01:01:44.611 --> 01:01:48.323
- He seems a little shaky.
- Don't worry about him.

01:01:48.406 --> 01:01:51.326
If the killer is following a pattern,
maybe we can figure out who's next.

01:01:51.409 --> 01:01:53.411
I wouldn't follow
a killer's pattern.

01:01:53.495 --> 01:01:56.748
We were all involved in Woodsboro.
Could be any one of us.

01:01:56.831 --> 01:02:01.211
So what do you wanna do, bonehead? Sit
here and wait and see who drops next?

01:02:01.253 --> 01:02:03.797
- Well, I don't know. "Phonehead."

01:02:06.258 --> 01:02:09.094
- Gale's not here!

01:02:09.177 --> 01:02:11.429
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

01:02:11.513 --> 01:02:14.558
You three
look deep in thought.

01:02:14.599 --> 01:02:17.602
Have you ever felt a knife
cut through human flesh...

01:02:17.686 --> 01:02:22.399
- and scrape the bone beneath?
- It's him.

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.943
- Who?
- The killer.

01:02:24.985 --> 01:02:27.487
He can see us.

01:02:33.076 --> 01:02:36.329
- Just keep him on the phone.
- What do you want me to say?

01:02:36.413 --> 01:02:40.083
I- I don't know. Just keep him talking.
Come on, Gale.

01:02:40.166 --> 01:02:42.210
- Uh- Hi.
- What are we doing?

01:02:42.294 --> 01:02:44.212
Look for somebody
with a cell phone.

01:02:44.296 --> 01:02:47.591
- So what's your favorite scary movie?
- You'll never find me.

01:02:47.632 --> 01:02:50.427
What do you care?
Let 'em have their fun.

01:02:50.468 --> 01:02:53.805
So, uh-
What's up?

01:02:53.889 --> 01:02:56.474
What's your
favorite scary movie?

01:02:56.558 --> 01:03:01.438
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening.
What's yours?

01:03:01.479 --> 01:03:03.773
- What's your problem?
- Sorry.

01:03:03.857 --> 01:03:07.485
Wait. Let me guess.
The House On Sorority Row?

01:03:07.569 --> 01:03:10.739
Dorm That Dripped Blood?
Splatter University?

01:03:10.822 --> 01:03:13.241
Graduation Day?
Final Exam?

01:03:13.325 --> 01:03:15.327
- Am I close?
- Closer than you think.

01:03:16.995 --> 01:03:21.333
Too slow, geek.
Do you want to die?

01:03:21.416 --> 01:03:25.128
Is that the best you can do? Because
Billy and Stu were much more original.

01:03:25.212 --> 01:03:27.506
Hey!

01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:29.508
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

01:03:29.591 --> 01:03:31.635
- Gale Weathers, author of The Woodsboro Murders.
- Who?

01:03:31.676 --> 01:03:33.637
Come on.

01:03:33.678 --> 01:03:35.847
Okay.

01:03:35.931 --> 01:03:38.350
He's gotta be
around here someplace.

01:03:38.433 --> 01:03:40.685
He's just playing with us.

01:03:42.854 --> 01:03:44.981
White male suspect-
nine o'clock.

01:03:45.023 --> 01:03:48.985
- My clock or your clock?
- Your clock.

01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:51.279
I'll go
around the back.

01:03:52.614 --> 01:03:55.200
Why are you even here,
Randy?

01:03:55.283 --> 01:03:58.078
You'll never be
the leading man.

01:03:58.161 --> 01:04:00.080
Fuck you!

01:04:00.163 --> 01:04:03.625
No matter how hard you try,
you'll never be the hero,

01:04:03.708 --> 01:04:06.461
and you'll never, ever
get the girl.

01:04:06.545 --> 01:04:09.089
- Shit!
- Shit! Sorry.

01:04:09.172 --> 01:04:12.968
- Hey, man-
- Wrong guy, dead boy.

01:04:13.051 --> 01:04:17.264
Oh, yeah? Well, let's redirect
a moment, Mr. I'm-So-Original.

01:04:19.266 --> 01:04:21.726
- What's she doing?
- I don't know.

01:04:21.768 --> 01:04:23.728
Hey! Ah!

01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:25.730
- What just happened?
- What the hell are you doing?

01:04:25.772 --> 01:04:29.150
- A citizen's arrest-
- Can I help you?

01:04:29.234 --> 01:04:32.529
- Hello? Hello?
- Sorry. Beg your pardon.

01:04:32.571 --> 01:04:37.200
Where's your innovation? Why copycat
two high school loser-ass dickheads?

01:04:37.242 --> 01:04:39.870
Stu was a pussy-ass
wet rag.

01:04:39.953 --> 01:04:43.164
And Billy Loomis- Billy Loomis!
What the fuck!

01:04:43.248 --> 01:04:47.878
Jesus! What a rat-lookin',
homo-repressed mama's boy!

01:04:47.919 --> 01:04:49.880
Why not set
your goals higher, huh?

01:04:49.921 --> 01:04:52.883
You wanna be one
of the big boys? Huh?

01:04:52.924 --> 01:04:56.970
Manson, Bundy, O.J.,
Son-

01:05:34.132 --> 01:05:37.344
- Where's Randy?
- I don't know. This guy just grabbed me.

01:05:37.427 --> 01:05:39.846
- I'm okay, Mom.
- I don't see him.

01:05:42.724 --> 01:05:44.684
Randy!

01:05:44.768 --> 01:05:46.686
Ah!

01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:48.688
What's goin' on?

01:05:50.398 --> 01:05:52.317
Yo, man.
Who broke my window?

01:06:26.685 --> 01:06:29.437
Did your computer
just freeze?

01:06:29.521 --> 01:06:32.899
You have an instant message,
that's all. Just hit "alt-M."

01:06:32.983 --> 01:06:34.901
Yeah, but I'm
not signed on.

01:06:34.985 --> 01:06:38.321
Someone here in the library.
All the terminals are connected.

01:06:56.298 --> 01:06:59.342
- He's here.
- Shit.

01:06:59.426 --> 01:07:02.137
Get here away from the computer.
Sid, it's probably just a sick joke.

01:07:06.099 --> 01:07:08.185
- May I see your screen, please.
- Wait right here.

01:07:08.268 --> 01:07:10.228
Yeah.

01:07:19.112 --> 01:07:21.156
- Psst! Sid, you okay?

01:07:21.239 --> 01:07:23.158
- Cotton.
- Can we talk for a sec?

01:07:23.241 --> 01:07:25.619
Um, this, this isn't
a good time.

01:07:25.702 --> 01:07:27.913
Come on, Sid.
You sent me to prison.

01:07:27.996 --> 01:07:30.916
I did over a year for you.
You can give me two minutes.

01:07:30.999 --> 01:07:34.211
Cotton, I'm sorry. Every day I'm sorry.
I don't know how to apologize anymore.

01:07:34.294 --> 01:07:38.048
Sorry-schmarry, Sid. I have the solution
to all of our problems.

01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:39.841
What are you
talking about?

01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:42.552
First of all,
forget Gale Weathers.

01:07:42.594 --> 01:07:45.222
She doesn't get it. She doesn't
see the story. Between you and me,

01:07:45.263 --> 01:07:47.849
she wouldn't see the story if
it smacked her in the side of the head.

01:07:47.933 --> 01:07:50.977
I mean, have you read that book?
Which brings me to my point.

01:07:51.061 --> 01:07:53.939
Who calls me out of the blue,
but Diane Sawyer.

01:07:54.022 --> 01:07:55.941
Believe me, I was
as shocked as you are.

01:07:56.024 --> 01:07:58.527
She tells me that if you and I
go on the air together,

01:07:58.610 --> 01:08:01.112
- she will give us the entire hour.
- What?

01:08:01.196 --> 01:08:05.450
We're talking prime time, Sid.
You, me and Diane Sawyer.

01:08:05.534 --> 01:08:07.869
- Cotton, I can't.
- No, no. Look, Sidney.

01:08:07.953 --> 01:08:09.996
If this is about money,
it's not like we're not getting paid.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.792
There's $10,000 each, not to mention what
I've got going on the side with the 900 number.

01:08:13.875 --> 01:08:17.087
- Cotton-
- I know. You don't like the press.

01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:19.421
I know that,
and I respect it.

01:08:19.506 --> 01:08:22.216
But-But, Sidney-

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:25.970
It's Diane Sawyer. Hello?

01:08:26.054 --> 01:08:31.434
She's a class act. Sidney, this could
be some very, very heavy exposure.

01:08:31.475 --> 01:08:34.145
I'm sorry.

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:37.649
Look, between the movie
and the book...

01:08:37.732 --> 01:08:40.277
people know the truth.

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:44.573
Let's get on with our lives. There's been
enough exposure. Why would you want any more?

01:08:44.656 --> 01:08:47.408
Why? I don't know,
Sidney. I don't know.

01:08:47.492 --> 01:08:50.328
Uh, maybe because I fucking
deserve a little exposure?

01:08:50.412 --> 01:08:52.330
I mean, come on, Sidney.
You dragged my name through the mud,

01:08:52.413 --> 01:08:54.666
everybody thinks I'm
some kind of psycho killer,

01:08:54.749 --> 01:08:58.086
and all I'm asking for is one fucking
Diane Sawyer interview...

01:08:58.170 --> 01:09:00.255
to maybe get my side
of the story straight.

01:09:00.337 --> 01:09:03.633
Now, I don't think I'm being
unreasonable in that request.

01:09:03.716 --> 01:09:06.051
Do you?
Honestly?

01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:10.307
I'm... sorry, Cotton,
but no.

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:15.812
You're sorry.

01:09:15.854 --> 01:09:18.773
Yeah, I bet you're
real sorry, Sidney.

01:09:18.857 --> 01:09:23.194
Such a good angle, Sidney.
Loveable and fucked up Sidney Prescott!

01:09:23.278 --> 01:09:26.488
Everybody's favorite
little victim!

01:09:26.573 --> 01:09:28.533
- Ow! What are you doing?
- Relax!

01:09:28.575 --> 01:09:30.577
- Put your hands on top of your head!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:35.332
Jesus! I'm not Billy Loomis!
You killed him! He's dead! Remember?

01:09:35.415 --> 01:09:38.167
Run it by me one more time,
will ya?

01:09:38.251 --> 01:09:42.296
- Why did you attack Sidney Prescott?
- I didn't- There was no attack.

01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:44.508
We were talking
very heatedly.

01:09:44.549 --> 01:09:46.551
Miss Prescott and I...

01:09:46.635 --> 01:09:50.055
have a very
complicated past.

01:09:50.095 --> 01:09:52.182
I didn't think
that was a crime.

01:09:52.224 --> 01:09:56.353
- No, but homicide is.
- Okay then, book me. Book me.

01:09:56.394 --> 01:09:58.647
Okay? Look.

01:09:58.730 --> 01:10:00.899
I don't know about homicide,
but you've definitely...

01:10:00.982 --> 01:10:04.361
got me for raising my voice
in a public library.

01:10:04.402 --> 01:10:08.823
We're dealing with four murders
here. You watch your mouth.

01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:14.454
That shouldn't have been Randy.

01:10:14.538 --> 01:10:17.749
- It should have been me.
- No.

01:10:17.832 --> 01:10:20.210
I should call his mother.

01:10:20.293 --> 01:10:23.088
Sid, I already made
that phone call.

01:10:27.801 --> 01:10:29.803
Are you okay?

01:10:29.886 --> 01:10:32.889
Stop treating me like glass,
Dewey, I'm not gonna break.

01:10:32.973 --> 01:10:36.017
It's okay to break.

01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:38.019
It's not gonna happen.

01:10:38.103 --> 01:10:40.730
You better hope
your alibi's airtight.

01:10:40.814 --> 01:10:44.568
Could I please remind everyone here
that I'm an innocent man.

01:10:44.609 --> 01:10:48.738
Don't you watch TV? Current Edition?
That was a very insightful program...

01:10:48.822 --> 01:10:52.492
on which it was made abundantly clear
that I'm an innocent man.

01:10:52.576 --> 01:10:56.246
So until you find me standing over
a dead body with a knife in my hand,

01:10:56.329 --> 01:10:58.498
I think you better treat me
with the rights and privileges...

01:10:58.582 --> 01:11:01.793
accorded to every innocent citizen
in this country.

01:11:06.047 --> 01:11:09.676
I don't- Is there- Is there
some problem with the word "innocent"?

01:11:09.759 --> 01:11:11.803
I know. It's a big one.
Chief?

01:11:22.981 --> 01:11:25.609
- What's going on?
- I have to let him go.

01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:27.861
- Why?
- We don't have anything on him.

01:11:32.574 --> 01:11:34.743
Sign here.

01:11:38.663 --> 01:11:42.501
Gale.
Enjoying the show?

01:11:42.584 --> 01:11:44.669
- Cops are funny.
- What do you think you're doing?

01:11:44.753 --> 01:11:47.380
Waiting for
my 15 minutes of fame.

01:11:47.464 --> 01:11:50.175
You can understand that,
can't you, Gale?

01:11:52.177 --> 01:11:54.513
Don't do anything stupid,
Cotton.

01:11:54.596 --> 01:11:59.100
Gale, you were so
instrumental in my freedom.

01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:02.229
You're not having
character doubts now, are you?

01:12:08.068 --> 01:12:11.154
- Sidney, if you change your mind-
- Come on. Take a hike.

01:12:13.698 --> 01:12:15.659
Sorry about that.

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:17.994
What a creep.

01:12:18.036 --> 01:12:20.038
They're gonna take you
somewhere safe, Sid.

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.791
Yeah?
Where's that.

01:12:22.874 --> 01:12:25.836
I don't know, but I'll
be there with you.

01:12:29.214 --> 01:12:31.633
We should get going.

01:12:31.716 --> 01:12:34.511
We'll take you by the dorm,
and you can pack some things.

01:12:34.553 --> 01:12:37.305
We've issued
a campus lock-in this evening.

01:12:37.389 --> 01:12:41.184
- No one's allowed out after dark, okay?
- Yeah.

01:12:41.268 --> 01:12:43.854
Who's doing this, Dewey?
I mean,

01:12:43.895 --> 01:12:46.439
if not Cotton,
then who?

01:12:46.523 --> 01:12:48.859
I don't know, Sid,
but I'll find him.

01:12:54.698 --> 01:12:58.076
Any leads, Gale? Do you think
the killer will come after you?

01:12:58.159 --> 01:13:00.203
How does it feel to be
on the other side of the news?

01:13:00.287 --> 01:13:02.330
There's Cotton.
Cotton! Hey!

01:13:02.414 --> 01:13:05.000
- Are you still a suspect?
- It's all been a huge misunderstanding.

01:13:05.083 --> 01:13:07.002
- Have you been officially released?
- Gale! Hang on one second.

01:13:07.085 --> 01:13:10.422
How about a photo?
No? You look great.

01:13:10.505 --> 01:13:12.424
How're you
holding up, Gale?

01:13:12.507 --> 01:13:16.052
Must be scary knowing somebody's out
there waiting, watching, enjoying all this.

01:13:16.136 --> 01:13:18.096
- How does that make you feel?
- Look, local woman!

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.765
I know that you hold me up
as your career template...

01:13:20.849 --> 01:13:24.853
and it gives you some sort of...
charge to challenge me.

01:13:24.936 --> 01:13:27.397
But give it a rest!

01:13:28.815 --> 01:13:30.817
You're right. I'm sorry.
It's my-

01:13:30.901 --> 01:13:32.819
It was the wrong time.
I'm sorry.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.995
- What's going on?
- Whoo, let's see. For starters, they impounded my van.

01:13:42.078 --> 01:13:44.831
It's now an official
crime scene, thanks to you.

01:13:44.915 --> 01:13:47.375
Here's your footage.
Enjoy.

01:13:47.459 --> 01:13:49.419
See ya.
Wouldn't wanna be ya.

01:13:49.461 --> 01:13:51.421
Joel, I need you!

01:13:51.463 --> 01:13:55.091
No. No, you need to
have your head examined.

01:14:08.146 --> 01:14:11.900
- I feel bad, Dewey.

01:14:11.983 --> 01:14:13.902
I feel really bad.

01:14:15.529 --> 01:14:17.489
I never say that
because...

01:14:17.531 --> 01:14:20.283
I never feel bad
about anything.

01:14:20.367 --> 01:14:23.161
But I feel bad now.

01:14:26.873 --> 01:14:30.126
Is this
just another...

01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:33.088
brilliant Gale Weathers
performance?

01:14:33.171 --> 01:14:36.466
There are no cameras here.
I just wanna find this fucker!

01:14:38.927 --> 01:14:43.139
I- I really do.

01:14:45.642 --> 01:14:47.894
Me too.

01:14:57.821 --> 01:14:59.739
Could I
give you a hand?

01:15:03.952 --> 01:15:06.663
What's in here?

01:15:06.746 --> 01:15:09.457
Just some crowd footage
that Joel shot.

01:15:12.794 --> 01:15:15.213
Hey, wait a minute.

01:15:19.134 --> 01:15:22.804
If the killer really is
watching and relishing every minute,

01:15:22.888 --> 01:15:25.182
then he'd be here
on these tapes, right?

01:15:25.223 --> 01:15:28.226
- At each crime scene.
- It's worth a look.

01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:34.441
It's definitely
worth a look.

01:15:52.209 --> 01:15:54.127
This way.

01:15:55.170 --> 01:15:58.673
Dubbing room.
Editorial.

01:15:58.757 --> 01:16:00.717
Video archive.

01:16:05.347 --> 01:16:07.557
- It's locked.
- Can you pick it?

01:16:07.641 --> 01:16:11.061
- That would be breaking and entering.
- No shit.

01:16:11.102 --> 01:16:13.647
There's gotta be a VCR
around here somewhere.

01:16:13.730 --> 01:16:15.649
What's in there?

01:16:17.776 --> 01:16:20.278
- Now we're gettin' somewhere.
- Perfect!

01:16:35.126 --> 01:16:37.420
- Let's start with this one.

01:16:37.504 --> 01:16:40.715
- Sorry. Oh!
- Oh!

01:16:40.799 --> 01:16:43.260
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

01:16:43.301 --> 01:16:46.054
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:13.081
You're a money-hungry,
fame-seeking-

01:17:13.165 --> 01:17:17.085
forgive me for saying-
mediocre writer...

01:17:17.169 --> 01:17:20.589
who's got a cold storage shed
where her heart should be.

01:17:20.672 --> 01:17:23.175
- I didn't mean to imply-
- Listen.

01:17:23.258 --> 01:17:27.929
- You're cute when you're angry.
- I was rude.

01:17:28.013 --> 01:17:30.348
I was being rude.

01:17:34.019 --> 01:17:36.813
Dewey, I'm sorry.

01:17:36.897 --> 01:17:41.109
I never meant
to hurt you. Hey.

01:17:43.195 --> 01:17:46.448
Really.

01:18:07.302 --> 01:18:09.888
I should be studying.
You know I got a Bio-

01:18:09.971 --> 01:18:12.474
Dewey.

01:18:12.557 --> 01:18:14.976
Dewey!

01:18:16.645 --> 01:18:20.190
- Sorry.
- That's not my footage.

01:18:20.232 --> 01:18:21.816
Outside.

01:18:26.279 --> 01:18:30.033
- Fuck you!
- No matter how hard you try, you'll never be the hero,

01:18:30.075 --> 01:18:32.953
and you'll never, ever
get the girl.

01:18:34.037 --> 01:18:35.956
- Sorry.
- Wrong guy, dead boy.

01:18:41.127 --> 01:18:44.256
- Stay here.
- Dewey, don't!

01:19:01.106 --> 01:19:03.108
Dewey!

01:19:05.986 --> 01:19:08.238
There's no one there.

01:21:07.232 --> 01:21:09.150
Fuck!

01:21:30.088 --> 01:21:32.173
Gale!

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:34.259
Gale?

01:21:52.527 --> 01:21:54.613
Gale!

01:22:41.826 --> 01:22:43.745
No!

01:23:28.589 --> 01:23:32.552
So.

01:23:32.593 --> 01:23:34.929
Listen, Sid.

01:23:36.514 --> 01:23:38.766
Hey, wait up!

01:23:38.808 --> 01:23:41.519
- She's- She's fine.
- I'm her therapist.

01:23:43.604 --> 01:23:45.565
Bye, Derek.

01:23:45.690 --> 01:23:47.859
Bye.

01:23:47.942 --> 01:23:49.944
We better get going.

01:23:54.782 --> 01:23:57.368
When this is all over,

01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:00.788
I'll still be here.

01:24:36.491 --> 01:24:39.243
You! Prepare to die.

01:24:40.828 --> 01:24:43.581
- You gave up your letters.
- Oh, man.

01:24:45.333 --> 01:24:48.002
I'm not-
Uh, guys-

01:24:48.086 --> 01:24:50.838
- To Troy! We march!
- Whoo!

01:24:53.341 --> 01:24:55.426
This is so romantic.

01:24:55.468 --> 01:24:57.595
- And so Greek!

01:25:03.434 --> 01:25:08.106
I was in the wrong place
But it must have been the right time

01:25:08.189 --> 01:25:12.276
I was in the right place
But it must have been the wrong song

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:17.115
I was in the right vein
But it seemed like the wrong arm

01:25:17.198 --> 01:25:20.993
I was in the right world
But it seemed like wrong, wrong, wrong

01:25:21.119 --> 01:25:24.789
- Wrong song
- Who do you love, baby?

01:25:24.872 --> 01:25:28.793
- Sidney.
- Did you say

01:25:28.835 --> 01:25:31.045
No, I said Sidney!

01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:55.386
So, where are you
taking us, anyway?

01:25:55.469 --> 01:25:58.305
If we tell you,
we'll have to kill you.

01:25:59.557 --> 01:26:01.517
Don't ask; don't tell.

01:26:32.089 --> 01:26:33.841
Help me!

01:26:35.009 --> 01:26:37.761
Oh, my God!

01:26:38.355 --> 01:26:40.774
Outta the car,
you fucker!

01:26:48.031 --> 01:26:50.951
Get down back there!
Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

01:26:50.992 --> 01:26:52.953
I'll blow your
fuckin' head-

01:27:32.242 --> 01:27:36.746
- Is he dead?
- I don't think so.

01:27:38.707 --> 01:27:41.793
- He's still breathing.
- Oh!

01:27:45.422 --> 01:27:47.465
Oh, is he dead?

01:27:47.507 --> 01:27:50.260
Oh, God.
I think so.

01:27:57.267 --> 01:28:01.354
- How are you
supposed to get outta here?

01:28:09.946 --> 01:28:13.950
Hallie, it's the only way out.
Help me out.

01:28:17.537 --> 01:28:19.456
Come on.

01:28:46.316 --> 01:28:49.069
We're jammed up against
a pole.

01:28:52.113 --> 01:28:53.990
Oh, my God.

01:29:08.838 --> 01:29:10.966
Oh. Oh, my God.

01:29:13.176 --> 01:29:15.762
Come on, Sid.
Don't! Sid!

01:29:21.017 --> 01:29:23.770
God, I hate this shit.

01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:30.026
Oh, my God.
Don't do that again.

01:29:41.538 --> 01:29:43.623
Try the window.

01:29:58.388 --> 01:30:00.307
- Shit!
- Get me the fuck outta here, Sid.

01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:03.893
I can't. The door's jammed.
You have to go through the front.

01:30:03.977 --> 01:30:05.979
- Oh, no fuckin' way.
- Hallie, do it.

01:30:06.062 --> 01:30:09.816
Go on.
Hallie, go.

01:30:17.907 --> 01:30:19.826
Okay.

01:30:19.909 --> 01:30:23.663
Okay, that's right.
Shh.

01:30:24.998 --> 01:30:28.084
Okay.
Okay, that's good.

01:30:31.004 --> 01:30:33.506
Oh, right
through his eye.

01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:35.592
Come on.

01:30:35.675 --> 01:30:37.677
That's good. Easy. Easy.

01:30:37.761 --> 01:30:40.430
He's not gonna hurt you.

01:30:50.774 --> 01:30:53.068
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

01:30:55.862 --> 01:30:59.616
- Hallie.
- What?

01:30:59.699 --> 01:31:01.785
I wanna know
who it is.

01:31:01.868 --> 01:31:04.037
- Oh, no. Come on, Sid.
Please? Let's just go.

01:31:04.079 --> 01:31:06.539
Look, look.
Stupid people go back.

01:31:06.623 --> 01:31:09.793
Smart people run. We're smart people, so
we should just get the fuck outta here.

01:31:09.876 --> 01:31:12.212
Hallie, I'm sick
of running.

01:31:12.462 --> 01:31:15.381
- If we know who it is, then it's over.
- No, we can just get the police.

01:31:15.464 --> 01:31:18.550
And when we come back, he'll be gone.
It'll only take a minute.

01:31:18.633 --> 01:31:22.969
- I have to do this.
- Sid. No, Sid. Come back!

01:31:23.052 --> 01:31:27.055
Sid, come back.
Shit.

01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:40.897
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:31:42.148 --> 01:31:45.567
- He's gone!
- What?

01:31:45.650 --> 01:31:47.985
- No!

01:32:14.232 --> 01:32:15.108
- Gale.

01:32:17.194 --> 01:32:18.000
Get away from me.

01:32:18.001 --> 01:32:20.673
This isn't what it looks like.

01:32:20.756 --> 01:32:24.341
I found Dewey. I tried to help him.
I- No, no. Gale, wait.

01:32:24.425 --> 01:32:26.594
Gale! Gale, wait!
Gale!

01:32:29.289 --> 01:32:30.165
Shit.

01:32:36.433 --> 01:32:38.054
- You can't miss the street-
- Help me!

01:32:38.089 --> 01:32:41.603
...curfew in full effect.
- Give me the goddamn phone!

01:32:41.686 --> 01:32:45.604
- Gale. I was right
in the middle of a story.

01:32:45.639 --> 01:32:48.691
- What's the matter?
- Operator, this is an emergency!

01:32:48.726 --> 01:32:50.936
- What's happening?
- The killer!

01:32:51.436 --> 01:32:53.021
Cotton Weary?

01:33:41.736 --> 01:33:42.612
Hello?

01:33:47.075 --> 01:33:47.951
Gus?

01:33:53.748 --> 01:33:54.583
Hello?

01:34:00.881 --> 01:34:01.840
Hello?

01:34:13.143 --> 01:34:14.060
Hello?

01:35:12.294 --> 01:35:14.297
Derek?

01:35:14.379 --> 01:35:17.718
Derek!
Oh, God.

01:35:17.801 --> 01:35:21.638
Thank you. Thank God, Sid. Thought I was
gonna be up there till opening night.

01:35:21.722 --> 01:35:24.558
- Shit! Who tied these?
We gotta get outta here.

01:35:24.641 --> 01:35:28.481
- He's out there. He killed Hallie.
- What are you talking about?

01:35:28.564 --> 01:35:31.151
- The killer! He's here.
- Where?

01:35:31.233 --> 01:35:34.487
Right here.

01:35:34.570 --> 01:35:37.406
- You're fast, Sid.
- Get me down. Hurry!

01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:41.997
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You really wanna trust your boyfriend?

01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:45.833
Don't you know history repeats itself?

01:35:45.917 --> 01:35:47.836
Hmm, Sid?

01:35:55.094 --> 01:35:57.597
Mickey.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:00.936
Surprise, Sidney.

01:36:01.019 --> 01:36:05.774
- What the fuck?
- Since Derek, here,

01:36:05.857 --> 01:36:09.361
I been on my own
all fuckin' night.

01:36:09.444 --> 01:36:12.115
- Thanks a lot, partner.
- You motherfucker!

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:14.701
Sid, he's crazy.
You know me better than that.

01:36:14.785 --> 01:36:19.373
Come on, Sid.
I gotta have a partner.

01:36:19.456 --> 01:36:22.211
I couldn't have possibly
done this alone.

01:36:22.294 --> 01:36:24.630
- God, Derek.
- Sid.

01:36:24.713 --> 01:36:28.217
Oh, no, Sid. Sid.
No, no, no, no.

01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:30.803
It's okay, Derek.
We got her.

01:36:30.888 --> 01:36:33.307
You-
Sid, he's lying!

01:36:33.391 --> 01:36:36.727
Sid! Sid!
Untie me.

01:36:36.811 --> 01:36:39.564
- Sid, untie me.
- Hmm?

01:36:39.647 --> 01:36:41.568
Boyfriend. Killer.
Boyfriend. Killer.

01:36:41.651 --> 01:36:44.821
Sid, the man is lying!
Untie me. Sid.

01:36:44.904 --> 01:36:47.824
Untie me.
Untie me.

01:36:47.907 --> 01:36:51.913
What do you think, Derek?
Sidney experiencing some deja vu?

01:36:51.998 --> 01:36:55.084
No. No. I am gonna
fuckin' kill you!

01:36:55.168 --> 01:36:58.587
Fuckin' kill you!
You are dead! Dead!

01:36:58.670 --> 01:37:01.673
- Derek.

01:37:01.756 --> 01:37:03.927
- Sid. - Derek.

01:37:08.515 --> 01:37:10.434
I'm sorry.

01:37:11.853 --> 01:37:14.608
I never...

01:37:14.691 --> 01:37:18.110
would've...
hurt you.

01:37:18.194 --> 01:37:20.530
Never.

01:37:32.627 --> 01:37:35.381
You should really deal with
your trust issues, Sid.

01:37:35.465 --> 01:37:39.135
I mean, poor Derek. He's completely
innocent. And such a nice boy too.

01:37:39.219 --> 01:37:43.473
He's bright and funny and
handsome. Decent singing voice.

01:37:43.556 --> 01:37:46.811
This was just the kind of boy
you'd like to take home to Mom.

01:37:46.895 --> 01:37:49.314
- If you had a mom.
- Fuck you!

01:37:49.397 --> 01:37:52.400
Oh! So vulgar. Did Billy
let you talk to him this way?

01:37:52.484 --> 01:37:55.155
Billy was a sick fuck,
just like you.

01:37:55.239 --> 01:37:58.075
No. Billy was a sick fuck
who tried to get away with it.

01:37:58.158 --> 01:38:00.911
Mickey is a sick fuck
who wants to get caught. Yeah!

01:38:00.994 --> 01:38:04.331
See, I've got my whole defense
planned out.

01:38:04.414 --> 01:38:07.002
I'm gonna blame
the movies.

01:38:07.086 --> 01:38:09.755
Pretty cool, huh?
It hasn't been done before.

01:38:09.839 --> 01:38:13.343
You see, this is just the beginning,
a prelude to the trial.

01:38:13.426 --> 01:38:16.848
That's where the real fun is 'cause
these days it's all about the trial.

01:38:16.931 --> 01:38:20.351
Can't you see it? The effects
of cinema violence on society.

01:38:20.434 --> 01:38:23.187
I'll get Dershovitz
or Cochran to represent me.

01:38:23.271 --> 01:38:25.606
Bob Dole on the witness stand
in my defense.

01:38:25.690 --> 01:38:28.027
Hell, the Christian Coalition'll
pay my legal fees.

01:38:28.111 --> 01:38:31.364
It's airtight, Sid.

01:38:31.447 --> 01:38:34.200
I'm an innocent victim.

01:38:34.284 --> 01:38:37.372
- You're a psychotic.
- Yeah, well. Shh.

01:38:37.455 --> 01:38:39.374
That'll be our little secret.

01:38:39.457 --> 01:38:43.545
'Cause people love a good trial.
It's like theater. They're dyin' for it.

01:38:43.628 --> 01:38:47.051
And I've worked hard
to give the audience what they want.

01:38:47.135 --> 01:38:50.637
That's what Billy was good at.
He knew... it's all about...

01:38:50.672 --> 01:38:52.472
- execution.
- Yeah?

01:38:52.556 --> 01:38:56.560
Well, you're forgetting
one thing about Billy Loomis.

01:38:56.643 --> 01:38:59.315
What's that?

01:38:59.398 --> 01:39:01.318
I fucking killed him.

01:39:01.401 --> 01:39:03.819
You piece of shit!

01:39:29.684 --> 01:39:31.603
Sid.

01:39:33.522 --> 01:39:36.107
You got a Linda Hamilton
thing going.

01:39:36.191 --> 01:39:39.110
No, no. It's nice.
I like it.

01:39:39.194 --> 01:39:42.699
Now, who's doin' that?

01:39:42.783 --> 01:39:47.204
Could that be... the mystery guest
waiting in the wings?

01:39:47.287 --> 01:39:49.875
Told ya I had a partner.

01:39:49.959 --> 01:39:51.962
Surprise cameo
just for you.

01:39:56.382 --> 01:39:58.801
Gale.

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:11.569
Mrs. Loomis?

01:40:11.652 --> 01:40:15.989
- What?
- Billy's mother!

01:40:16.072 --> 01:40:19.492
Nice twist, huh?
Didn't see it comin', did ya?

01:40:20.493 --> 01:40:22.463
Jesus.

01:40:22.498 --> 01:40:25.501
It can't be. I've-
I've seen pictures of you.

01:40:25.585 --> 01:40:27.836
This is 60 pounds
and a lot of work later.

01:40:27.919 --> 01:40:30.672
It's called a make-over.
You should try it.

01:40:30.755 --> 01:40:34.177
Look a little tired
yourself there, Gale.

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:37.180
- So you two are in this together?
- Yeah, well.

01:40:37.264 --> 01:40:42.019
Had to have financing.
Tuition's expensive.

01:40:42.105 --> 01:40:46.859
Deb, there- my backer. We met on the
Internet. Psycho Web site. Classifieds.

01:40:46.942 --> 01:40:51.280
There's only an estimated
97 active serial killers in the country.

01:40:51.363 --> 01:40:55.036
So Mickey, here, was quite a find.
Definitely one on the way up.

01:40:55.119 --> 01:40:59.041
- All he needed was a little
guidance and nurturing.

01:40:59.124 --> 01:41:01.877
Told you it was gonna work.
Wait till the trial!

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.880
It is gonna rock!

01:41:03.963 --> 01:41:07.384
Oh, Mickey.
There's not gonna be a trial.

01:41:14.309 --> 01:41:16.561
- Gale!

01:41:29.576 --> 01:41:31.411
Two birds, one stone.

01:41:33.247 --> 01:41:37.586
Oh, Mickey was a good boy, but, my God,
that whole blame the movies motive.

01:41:37.670 --> 01:41:39.755
Did you buy that
for one second?

01:41:39.838 --> 01:41:42.925
Poor boy was completely
out of his mind.

01:41:43.008 --> 01:41:46.347
- And you're not?
- No. I'm very sane.

01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:49.934
My motive isn't
as '90s as Mickey's.

01:41:50.017 --> 01:41:53.354
Mine is just
good old fashioned revenge.

01:41:53.437 --> 01:41:56.276
You killed my son!

01:41:56.359 --> 01:42:00.113
And now I kill you. And I can't think
of anything more rational.

01:42:00.196 --> 01:42:02.949
You're never gonna
get away with this.

01:42:03.032 --> 01:42:05.368
Of course I will.

01:42:05.451 --> 01:42:07.706
Everything's traceable
back to Mickey.

01:42:07.789 --> 01:42:10.792
Including the cop gun he used
to kill everybody.

01:42:10.876 --> 01:42:12.961
But let's just suppose
that you...

01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:15.630
had gotten hold
of the other cop's gun.

01:42:15.714 --> 01:42:19.136
And you chased Mickey. And there was
a big shoot-out and a big scuffle.

01:42:19.219 --> 01:42:23.141
And you shot Mickey,
killed Mickey dead.

01:42:24.975 --> 01:42:29.481
But not before he got off
one shot at you.

01:42:29.565 --> 01:42:33.152
Okay. So, have I
covered everything?

01:42:33.235 --> 01:42:35.821
Are there any questions, any comments?
You know what, though?

01:42:35.905 --> 01:42:38.826
Who give a flyin' fuck
anyway?

01:42:38.910 --> 01:42:43.664
Let 'em try and track down
the second possible killer.

01:42:43.699 --> 01:42:47.001
You're as crazy
as your son was.

01:42:47.084 --> 01:42:50.340
What did you just say?

01:42:50.423 --> 01:42:55.178
Was that a negative, disparaging
remark about my son? About my Billy?

01:42:55.261 --> 01:42:57.347
No, Billy was a good boy.

01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:59.852
Billy was perfect.
You did a bang up job, Mrs. Loomis.

01:42:59.936 --> 01:43:03.104
It's not wise to patronize
a woman with a gun, Sidney.

01:43:03.188 --> 01:43:06.858
Randy spoke poorly of Billy,
and I got a little knife happy.

01:43:06.942 --> 01:43:09.363
I was a good mother.

01:43:09.446 --> 01:43:13.116
You know what
makes me sick?

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.953
I'm sick to death of people saying
that it's all the parent's fault.

01:43:16.036 --> 01:43:18.622
That it all starts with the family.
You wanna blame someone?

01:43:18.705 --> 01:43:20.793
Why don't you blame
your mother?

01:43:20.876 --> 01:43:24.380
She's the one who stole my husband
and broke up my family.

01:43:24.463 --> 01:43:28.050
And then you took my son!

01:43:29.637 --> 01:43:32.557
You don't know what it is
to be a mother.

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:37.061
To raise a child and teach him...
and guide him-

01:43:37.144 --> 01:43:39.695
And abandon him.

01:43:39.730 --> 01:43:41.986
Isn't Mickey
supposed to be dead?

01:46:20.173 --> 01:46:22.675
Don't you fuckin' move!

01:46:22.759 --> 01:46:25.511
- Goddammit!
- Cotton.

01:46:25.595 --> 01:46:28.934
Okay, okay, okay.
Everybody slow down.

01:46:29.017 --> 01:46:32.437
I have had
a very, very bad day,

01:46:32.520 --> 01:46:37.108
and I would like to know exactly
what the fuck is going on here?

01:46:37.192 --> 01:46:39.780
- Sidney?
- Cotton, meet Billy Loomis' mother.

01:46:39.863 --> 01:46:41.782
She's the killer.

01:46:41.865 --> 01:46:43.784
What?

01:46:46.955 --> 01:46:49.375
- Then who's that?
- The other killer.

01:46:49.458 --> 01:46:53.796
- Mickey.
- Okay.

01:46:53.879 --> 01:46:56.382
- Look, Cotton-
- Shut up.

01:46:56.465 --> 01:46:59.470
So. Hi.

01:47:01.139 --> 01:47:03.809
You're, uh,
not Debbie Salt, are you?

01:47:03.892 --> 01:47:06.645
You're not with
the Post Telegraph.

01:47:06.728 --> 01:47:09.483
No, but I can still
help you, Cotton.

01:47:09.566 --> 01:47:11.901
Ah-ah-ah!

01:47:11.985 --> 01:47:14.118
You don't need her.
Let me kill her!

01:47:14.153 --> 01:47:18.324
As long as she's alive,
you're never gonna be the lead story.

01:47:18.359 --> 01:47:20.663
That's what you really want,
isn't it, Cotton?

01:47:20.746 --> 01:47:23.081
If you really wanna be
in the spotlight,

01:47:23.164 --> 01:47:26.501
just let me kill her...
right now.

01:47:26.584 --> 01:47:29.921
Then you're the only survivor.
You're the star!

01:47:32.342 --> 01:47:36.144
She sent you to prison
for a year!

01:47:36.179 --> 01:47:39.516
Personally, I think
it's rather poetic.

01:47:46.609 --> 01:47:50.362
No. No, Cotton,
don't you listen to her.

01:47:50.446 --> 01:47:53.284
Well- Well-

01:47:53.367 --> 01:47:55.870
It's, uh, quite a predicament
you're in, Sid.

01:47:55.953 --> 01:47:59.540
- Cotton-
- I mean, she makes a good point.

01:47:59.624 --> 01:48:01.709
Let me think about this.

01:48:01.794 --> 01:48:03.880
Maybe you should too.

01:48:03.963 --> 01:48:07.133
Betcha that Diane Sawyer interview's
lookin' real good right about now.

01:48:10.970 --> 01:48:13.391
Huh?

01:48:23.570 --> 01:48:25.906
Consider it done.

01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:48.099
Wow.

01:48:48.182 --> 01:48:51.102
That... was intense.

01:49:03.116 --> 01:49:05.120
Hey, Sidney, uh-

01:49:05.203 --> 01:49:09.124
Look, I want you to know that I would
never, ever do anything to hurt you.

01:49:09.159 --> 01:49:12.043
Cotton, give me the gun.

01:49:15.132 --> 01:49:19.219
Yeah. Okay. Sure.
Take it.

01:49:19.303 --> 01:49:22.604
Hey, Sid, we should talk about
exactly what happened here.

01:49:22.639 --> 01:49:26.145
You know- I mean, get our stories
straight for the press statement.

01:49:26.228 --> 01:49:28.314
- Oh, shit!

01:49:28.397 --> 01:49:31.483
- Cotton.
- Could somebody get me outta here?

01:49:31.567 --> 01:49:33.986
Gale!
Are you all right?

01:49:34.069 --> 01:49:35.990
I been shot.
Of course not.

01:49:36.073 --> 01:49:38.624
- Help!
- Give me your hand, Gale.

01:49:38.659 --> 01:49:41.329
Jesus, Gale,
you scared the crap outta me.

01:49:41.412 --> 01:49:43.831
- Isn't anybody else
down there, is there?

01:49:43.914 --> 01:49:47.003
So much for reporting
from the trenches, huh?

01:49:47.086 --> 01:49:50.840
- Shut up, Cotton.
- How bad is it?

01:49:50.875 --> 01:49:53.259
Just bounced off my ribs.

01:49:53.343 --> 01:49:55.678
Geez, Gale, you got
more lives than a cat.

01:50:03.021 --> 01:50:06.441
Give me one of those.

01:50:06.524 --> 01:50:08.612
Is she dead?

01:50:08.695 --> 01:50:11.783
I don't know.
They always come back.

01:50:23.879 --> 01:50:25.798
Whoa!

01:50:41.317 --> 01:50:43.486
Just in case.

01:50:52.998 --> 01:50:55.291
- That about wraps it up, Chief.
- Okay, Frank.

01:50:55.326 --> 01:50:57.585
Take it easy.
You got a couple broken ribs.

01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:59.756
- Greg, I'm okay.
- Sure.

01:51:02.343 --> 01:51:04.428
Hey, Gale.
Are you all right?

01:51:04.511 --> 01:51:07.264
- Joel.
- I'm- I'm back.

01:51:07.347 --> 01:51:11.687
You know, I was thinking maybe we could
get the scoop like in the old days.

01:51:11.770 --> 01:51:15.274
You're Gale Weathers...
at Windsor College.

01:51:15.357 --> 01:51:17.359
We got a live one here!

01:51:17.443 --> 01:51:19.361
- Move it!

01:51:19.445 --> 01:51:22.950
- Where's Gale?
- There room in that one over there?

01:51:23.034 --> 01:51:25.369
- Yeah! Watch your back!
- Dewey!

01:51:26.287 --> 01:51:28.956
- Let's go!
- Oh, God.

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:31.461
I can't believe
you're alive.

01:51:31.496 --> 01:51:34.213
- Are you okay?
- Gale.

01:51:34.297 --> 01:51:36.764
You hang in there.

01:51:36.799 --> 01:51:40.470
- Knife went into some old scar tissue.

01:51:40.553 --> 01:51:42.474
Saved his life.

01:51:44.225 --> 01:51:46.478
Bye-bye.

01:51:47.646 --> 01:51:50.482
- I'm coming with you.

01:51:55.822 --> 01:51:58.241
- Can you tell us what you saw?
- What happened in there?

01:51:58.325 --> 01:52:00.911
Can you tell us how it feels
to be a hero?

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:09.338
Talk to Cotton. He's the man
you want to interview.

01:52:09.421 --> 01:52:13.468
He's the hero.

01:52:13.503 --> 01:52:17.515
- Cotton!

01:52:17.598 --> 01:52:20.101
- What went on in there?
- Is it true you're a hero?

01:52:24.691 --> 01:52:26.658
- Details, please!
- Look, guys,

01:52:26.693 --> 01:52:28.695
no one wants to give you
the story more than I do.

01:52:28.730 --> 01:52:31.030
Unfortunately, there is
a time and a place,

01:52:31.114 --> 01:52:34.035
and indeed, a price for everything,
so feel free to call me.

01:52:34.119 --> 01:52:36.287
Come on, Cotton.
Tell us something.

01:52:36.371 --> 01:52:39.040
Well, uh,
I'll tell you one thing.

01:52:39.124 --> 01:52:42.377
It'll make a hell of a movie.
Thank you.

01:53:04.957 --> 01:53:08.544
Life's river shall rise

01:53:08.628 --> 01:53:10.546
She said

01:53:10.630 --> 01:53:15.885
And only the strong
shall survive, she said

01:53:15.968 --> 01:53:21.390
But I'm feeling quite weak
she said

01:53:21.474 --> 01:53:26.145
Will you comfort
and forgive me, she said

01:53:35.821 --> 01:53:38.574
She said
she's still searching

01:53:38.658 --> 01:53:41.410
For salvation's light

01:53:41.494 --> 01:53:44.163
Yet she wishes all day

01:53:44.247 --> 01:53:47.083
And then she prays all night

01:53:49.001 --> 01:53:51.837
She said she won't
speak of love

01:53:51.837 --> 01:53:54.340
'Cause love
she's never known

01:54:00.096 --> 01:54:02.765
Well, it's
moments like these

01:54:02.848 --> 01:54:06.435
When she hates to be alone

01:54:06.519 --> 01:54:09.105
Forgive me

01:54:09.188 --> 01:54:12.108
She said

01:54:27.456 --> 01:54:30.042
I'm sleepin' and right in
the middle of a good dream

01:54:30.126 --> 01:54:34.297
When all at once I wake up
from something that keeps

01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:37.717
Before I go insane I hold
my pillow to my head

01:54:37.717 --> 01:54:40.469
And spring up in my bed screaming out
the words I dread

01:54:40.553 --> 01:54:43.890
I think I love you

01:54:43.973 --> 01:54:46.642
I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

01:54:46.726 --> 01:54:51.981
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for

01:54:52.064 --> 01:54:55.484
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

01:54:55.568 --> 01:54:59.322
Though it worries me to say
that I never felt this way, yeah

01:54:59.405 --> 01:55:01.574
Believe me, you really
don't have to worry

01:55:01.657 --> 01:55:05.745
I only wanna make you happy
And if you say hey, go away, I will

01:55:05.828 --> 01:55:09.165
But I think better still
I'd better stay around and love you

01:55:09.248 --> 01:55:12.084
Do you think I have a case
Let me ask you to your face

01:55:12.168 --> 01:55:15.421
I think I love you

01:55:15.421 --> 01:55:18.174
Yeah, I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

01:55:18.257 --> 01:55:23.429
Afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for

01:55:23.512 --> 01:55:26.933
I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of

01:55:27.016 --> 01:55:30.770
Though it worries me to say
that I never felt this way, yeah

01:55:37.443 --> 01:55:40.613
I don't know what I'm up against,
I don't know what it's all about

01:55:40.613 --> 01:55:43.282
I got so much to think about
Yeah

01:55:43.282 --> 01:55:46.202
Yeah, I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of

01:55:46.285 --> 01:55:51.624
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
A love there is no cure for

01:55:51.624 --> 01:55:54.877
Do you think you love me

01:55:54.961 --> 01:55:58.130
I think I love you

01:55:58.214 --> 01:56:02.301
I think I love you

01:56:03.386 --> 01:56:08.057
Pain goes away
I dig a hole

01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:12.728
Pain goes away
I dig a hole

01:56:12.812 --> 01:56:17.567
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

01:56:17.650 --> 01:56:22.655
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

01:56:22.655 --> 01:56:27.076
Runnin', goin' out at night

01:56:27.159 --> 01:56:31.664
Friends they
push and pull you

01:56:31.747 --> 01:56:34.834
Burned out ground
Poor flowers

01:56:34.917 --> 01:56:40.339
Spinning, falling outta time

01:56:40.339 --> 01:56:44.927
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

01:56:45.011 --> 01:56:49.599
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

01:56:49.682 --> 01:56:54.186
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:59.275
When it goes away
I'll dig a hole

01:56:59.358 --> 01:57:01.527
La-la-la-la, ooh

01:57:01.611 --> 01:57:03.613
I'll dig a hole

01:57:03.696 --> 01:57:05.781
La-la-la-la, ooh

01:57:05.865 --> 01:57:10.536
When it goes away

01:57:32.058 --> 01:57:33.976
I'm reminded

01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:36.896
Someone thought they knew me

01:57:36.979 --> 01:57:41.901
That I hadn't changed at all

01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:52.745
Wrapped up in a
picture perfect package

01:57:52.745 --> 01:57:57.083
That just stands up
way too tall

01:58:02.338 --> 01:58:06.676
Because they see my world

01:58:09.512 --> 01:58:13.015
Ooh, through
the eyes of sand

01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:24.944
You walk in desert,
Baby, you're a polished stone

01:58:24.944 --> 01:58:28.698
You walk in desert,
Baby, you're a polished stone

01:58:30.116 --> 01:58:32.034
Ooh, oh

01:58:32.118 --> 01:58:36.205
You don't know my world

01:58:36.289 --> 01:58:40.126
You don't know my world

01:58:40.209 --> 01:58:44.130
You don't know my world

01:58:44.213 --> 01:58:47.550
Ah-ah

01:58:47.633 --> 01:58:50.970
You walk in the desert

01:58:51.053 --> 01:58:55.141
And I walk in the desert

01:58:55.224 --> 01:58:57.476
Yeah, I walk in the desert

01:58:57.476 --> 01:59:02.398
Scream !

01:59:02.481 --> 01:59:06.319
Could be your best friend.
Could be your enemy.

01:59:09.989 --> 01:59:12.491
Scream
I hear him coming

01:59:12.575 --> 01:59:15.578
Scream
I hear him coming

01:59:15.661 --> 01:59:17.997
I see him coming
I hear him coming, Peace

01:59:17.997 --> 01:59:20.750
Y'all be trippin'
Man, the ghetto got me I know it

01:59:20.833 --> 01:59:23.669
I be like eyes open, turnin'
With both of my toys on him

01:59:23.753 --> 01:59:26.005
These daydreams sometimes
turn to nightmares

01:59:26.005 --> 01:59:28.674
I be trying to shake it
but it seem to be like right there

01:59:28.758 --> 01:59:31.844
I know some homies who made
deals for a short time to live good

01:59:31.928 --> 01:59:34.680
But when its all over you should see
the data that'll put 'em out the hood

01:59:34.764 --> 01:59:37.516
One, two
I'm comin' for you

01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:40.353
Three, four
I'm kickin' up in your door

01:59:40.436 --> 01:59:43.105
This whole life
it seem to be a bad dream

01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:46.108
Scream as loud as you want but
ain't nobody gonna hear your scream

01:59:46.192 --> 01:59:48.861
Scream
I hear him coming

01:59:48.861 --> 01:59:51.530
Scream
I hear him coming

01:59:51.530 --> 01:59:54.367
Scream
I hear him coming

01:59:54.450 --> 01:59:57.036
Scream
I hear him coming

01:59:57.119 --> 02:00:00.122
Scream
I hear him coming

02:00:00.206 --> 02:00:02.708
I see him coming
I hear him coming

02:00:03.305 --> 02:00:09.747
