-Hey, Mum.
-I was worried. It's almost six.

I took a detour after Luss
to show Pia the pretty way.

Uh, "ditto."

01:44.280 --> 01:45.320
Oh! [laughs]

01:46.120 --> 01:49.080
So, did you grow up in America?
Or are you originally from--

01:49.160 --> 01:50.280
Jesus, Mum!

01:51.360 --> 01:53.600

-Okay.

[both chuckle]

02:42.080 --> 02:43.760
Uh, about the rare egg guy.

02:43.840 --> 02:48.280
So, that's what your documentary's about?
This egg collector from Rùm?

02:48.360 --> 02:49.840
He's not a collector. He…

02:50.720 --> 02:53.920
he guards rare eggs
against collectors who want to steal them.

It's, uh, it's a big trade.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.400
The way I see it,
this is going to be a story

about one of the last remaining holdouts
against the commodification of nature.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.880
Not about a man who watches eggs?

03:09.960 --> 03:12.360
Well, yeah, but it--

03:12.440 --> 03:13.760
He's like a vigilante.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.560
A guardian angel.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.640
Egg theft is illegal,

03:18.720 --> 03:24.240
but the local cops aren't interested,
or they're too lazy.

03:24.320 --> 03:25.440
I mean… [chuckles]

03:25.520 --> 03:28.800
Maybe if someone who looked like me
were stealing the eggs--

03:28.880 --> 03:32.600
They're probably just overstretched.
Policing's a very demanding job.

Sort of do.

04:19.200 --> 04:20.360
I was eight when he died,

04:20.440 --> 04:23.000

he's just been a few photographs.

but he's, uh…

-See, he's not even introducing you to me.
-Oh, sorry.

-Oh, your course, was it?
-No.

He thinks they're gonna name it
after him someday.

Well, I thought they were gonna name it
after me, so…

the smart move, eh?

and jack it fucking in.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.880
Is he… is he depressed, or--

09:33.960 --> 09:35.440
[Stuart] Of course he's depressed.

Okay, okay, fine. So…

10:05.880 --> 10:09.680
[exhales] Iain Adair was a guy who lived
up at Five Acres Farm on the hill there

10:09.760 --> 10:10.840
with his mum and dad.

10:11.560 --> 10:15.600
People said he was quiet, easily led,
not too bright. All of that, you know?

10:15.680 --> 10:17.800
But really, he was just some local guy.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.280
-Anyway--
-Turned out he tortured and killed people.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.280
I was building up to that.

I haven't got your storytelling instincts.
You tell it.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.760
-No, you spoiled it now.
-No, not the end bit with your dad.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.640
-What end bit with your dad?
-Can I just start from the beginning?

10:32.360 --> 10:34.560
Yeah, just pretend
you don't know the murder stuff yet.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.720
-Sure.

-Creepy.
-Very creepy.

11:35.040 --> 11:37.880
-So, of course, Dad gets called in.
-His dad was a local policeman.

It's a frenzy.

-Always sat right there.
-[tense music playing]

12:25.840 --> 12:26.960
[Davis] Anyway, this night,

12:27.920 --> 12:29.480
he's had way more than usual.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.360
People say he's talking weird.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.960
He's making a nuisance of himself.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.560
There's a poster of the missing couple
on the wall.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.560
He even makes comments about the girl.
And your dad--

12:41.640 --> 12:44.480
Yeah, the auld pissheid,
he tells Iain he's barred.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.360
Iain tells him to fuck off.

12:46.440 --> 12:49.560
Says he's got half a mind
to come back and shoot the place up.

12:49.640 --> 12:50.480
[Pia] Nice.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.720
Dad's worried now 'cause Iain's a farmer.
He's got a shotgun.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.360
So, Dad asks Kenneth, his dad,

13:01.440 --> 13:03.640
to go and check in on Iain,
have a word with him.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.200
-So then Dad--
-His dad, Kenneth.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.520
-Of course it's my dad.
-Sorry.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.480
[Davis] Dad drives up to Five Acres.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.600
[tense music continues]

13:17.560 --> 13:18.680
Knocks on the door.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.440
Says, "I just wanna talk to you," etc.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.840
Iain doesn't answer.

13:26.080 --> 13:30.440
Dad's walking back to his car
when Iain opens the upstairs window and…

13:32.520 --> 13:33.400
shoots him.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.240
Sorry. He shot your dad?

13:37.320 --> 13:38.640
-Yeah.
-[Stuart] Mm-hmm.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.720
-Not fatally, in the shoulder. Bad though.
-Holy shit.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.760
So Dad, crawling back to his car,
calls for backup,

13:45.840 --> 13:47.440
when, from inside the house…

13:48.560 --> 13:49.400
Bang! Bang! Bang!

13:50.920 --> 13:52.000
Then nothing.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.080
Backup arrives.

13:55.960 --> 13:56.800
They go in.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.880
Iain Adair shot his mum and dad,
then himself.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.720
Total wipeout.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.360
-Farmicide.
-[Davis] Mm.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.160
While they're looking around the farm,

14:11.920 --> 14:13.240
they check out the cellar.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.000
Oh God.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.880
[suspenseful music playing]

14:19.040 --> 14:22.520
[Davis] Behind a wardrobe,
there's a hidden door leading to a bunker.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.880
-Old WWII, or '60s, or something.
-Here we go.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.920
[Davis] And inside,
it's like a torture room.

14:42.920 --> 14:44.840
This guy had been abducting people.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.320
Keeping them down there and doing
God knows what for weeks at a time.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.880
And then burying the bodies
out in the fields.

14:51.960 --> 14:53.800
[helicopter whirring]

14:53.880 --> 14:55.560
-The honeymoon couple?
-[chuckles]

14:55.640 --> 14:58.080
-Fuck me, and the rest of them.
-The rest?

14:59.840 --> 15:02.960
[Davis] Around here, the countryside
can be pretty dangerous.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.880
There's deep water and all that, you know?

15:06.400 --> 15:08.240
Sometimes, people went missing.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.920
Walker takes a wrong turn, you know?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.160
Someone rents a kayak
and doesn't come back.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.880
Over the years,
nobody was really totting it all up.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.760
-How many we talking about?
-Eight.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.080
[Pia] Oh.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.000
All been tortured.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.480
And the rest of it.
Dark sex things. Really extreme stuff.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.360
-[Davis] Yeah. Okay.
-It'd give you nightmares.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.600
So… [chuckles nervously]

15:32.440 --> 15:33.800
Yeah, that was Iain Adair.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.640
That is a lot.

15:36.720 --> 15:37.840
-[Davis] Mm-hmm.
-[Stuart] Mm.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.760
And as you can imagine,
it doesn't look great on TripAdvisor.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.760
End result?

15:43.280 --> 15:44.600
Fuck-all visitors.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.360
-Didn't just shit in his victims' mouths.
-Don't know he did that.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.840
He shat on the tourist trade too.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.080
But your dad, he recovered.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.080
-I mean…
-Well, his injuries weren't that bad.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.280
-He was in hospital a couple of weeks.
-[Pia] Right.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.680
But while he was in there, he got MRSA.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.880
And that killed him over time.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.480
So, far as Mum's concerned,
Iain Adair killed Dad too.

16:09.560 --> 16:10.440
[Stuart] Well…

16:11.560 --> 16:13.000
-She's not wrong.
-Aye.

16:13.080 --> 16:13.920
[sighs]

16:14.000 --> 16:15.960
-[Stuart] Another pint?
-Aye. [laughs]

16:18.120 --> 16:19.000
Magda!

16:19.600 --> 16:20.440
Three pints.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.680
[liquid pouring]

16:25.760 --> 16:27.080
Can we go see where it happened?

16:29.920 --> 16:30.960
[glasses clatter]

16:42.600 --> 16:43.680
[Pia] It's perfect.

16:47.280 --> 16:48.280
You don't see it?

16:50.240 --> 16:51.920
-See what?
-Can we get in there?

16:52.000 --> 16:55.720
No. It's boarded up. There's planks.
Why would we wanna get in there?

16:56.360 --> 16:59.880
Because. This is what our film
should be about.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.600
All of this.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.320
What? This?

17:05.120 --> 17:06.120
Wha--

17:06.200 --> 17:07.280
Quaint little village,

17:07.360 --> 17:11.680
but for years, this Hannibal Lecter dude
has been operating a death den?

17:11.760 --> 17:14.280
At the heart of it? I mean, it's a story.

17:14.360 --> 17:16.680
-It's an actual story.
-Are you serious?

17:17.640 --> 17:19.120
-Well, yeah.
-But…

17:19.200 --> 17:23.120
-We're meeting the egg guy on Wednesday.
-Fuck the egg guy. I'm sorry. Come on.

17:23.840 --> 17:25.160
Come on! [scoffs]

17:26.360 --> 17:27.920
You said you liked the egg idea.

17:28.880 --> 17:29.760
Oh, babe.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.280
I kinda liked it.

17:32.920 --> 17:36.920
Just like I kinda like plain pasta
in a pinch. But I love this.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.080
I love it!

17:39.000 --> 17:41.080
So, um…

17:42.000 --> 17:44.360
A… a true crime film about Iain Adair?

17:44.440 --> 17:47.440
[Pia] We can pitch
to production companies, who will fund it.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.920
I had a meeting with Kate Cezar
at Historik. She might go for this.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.440
-People know the story.
-I didn't.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.560
I mean, it's not a whodunit.
There's no mystery.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.880
Are you nuts? [scoffs]

17:56.440 --> 17:59.760
The mystery is,
"How could someone do that shit?"

17:59.840 --> 18:02.120
It's "What the fuck?"
It's "Give me the details."

18:02.200 --> 18:05.320
And the details are so awful,
it is irresistible.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.440
-Sounds tacky.
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

18:07.520 --> 18:08.680
We won't let it be.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.440
It'll be a… a solid piece.

18:10.520 --> 18:12.040
Well-made, high-end.

18:12.120 --> 18:15.960
And it's exploring
the biggest topic, life and death.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.120
It's just not the kind of thing
I want us to make. Okay?

18:22.840 --> 18:24.720
Well, then, what do you want to make?

18:24.800 --> 18:27.960
A meditation on the Egg Man of Rùm

18:28.040 --> 18:29.760
that will maybe play at a festival

18:29.840 --> 18:33.080
and maybe be admired
by a couple dozen documentary nerds?

18:33.160 --> 18:35.360
Or something that people will watch?

18:35.440 --> 18:37.720
Something they actually want to see!

18:41.360 --> 18:43.320
If you don't wanna make it, I will.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.720
Iain Adair shot my dad.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.720
He died, Pia. [scoffs]

18:56.800 --> 18:57.640
He fucking died.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.880
-That's real. That's not fucking content.
-Of course. That's not what I meant.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.360
It'd dredge up so much shit for Mum.
She lost her husband.

19:03.440 --> 19:07.160
Okay, okay, and we can make that point.
Her point.

19:08.040 --> 19:09.280
He was a victim too.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.240
You said that he's been forgotten
in all of this.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.360
[Pia] It was so good. Thank you.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.880
Did you not like the dauphinoise?

19:25.520 --> 19:28.680
Uh, I just try to limit my carbs.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.520
But what I had was delicious.

19:32.160 --> 19:33.360
Oh.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.280
Good.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.280
[Pia] We would do it justice.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.680
It would feel and look professional.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.120
Babe.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.920
It's a brilliant idea.

19:58.120 --> 20:01.520
Visual showcase. Bring the tourists back.

20:03.840 --> 20:07.440
What was the name of that Netflix thing?
About the guy that killed women?

20:07.520 --> 20:09.400
Maybe narrow that down.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.480
One of them,
he ate her own eye in front of her.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.360
The Waltonville Claw.

20:14.440 --> 20:18.880
So, half this show
was just amazing, constant footage

20:18.960 --> 20:21.920
of Waltonville, forests and mountains,

20:22.000 --> 20:23.600
fucking waterfalls!

20:24.440 --> 20:25.520
Looked like a brochure.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.240
Yeah, my cousin actually booked a holiday
just off how it looked.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.200
[Pia] Hm.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.280
He said the place was fucking heaving
when he got there.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.440
Cunts get a load of this place
on their 4K fucking flat screens

20:37.520 --> 20:41.320
and they will be crawling all over us
like flies on dog shite,

20:42.000 --> 20:42.840
but with money.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.320
I've even got a drone you can use.

20:47.160 --> 20:50.080
-Opening shot.
-Moody piano chord. I love it.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.720
-Of course you've got a drone.
-Of course you're a cunt about it.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.320
Ah!

20:55.480 --> 20:57.040
I've got something even better.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.480
Wait there.

21:00.280 --> 21:01.120
Hang on.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.920
[footsteps thumping]

21:09.080 --> 21:10.320
-Okay.
-Yes!

21:12.000 --> 21:15.720
[Stuart] This is my mum's curiosity box.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.760
She was fucking obsessed
with the whole thing. Obsessed.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.880
My dad fucking hated it.

21:22.800 --> 21:23.920
This is a whole archive.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.480
[Stuart] I'd call it
a morbidly obsessive collection.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.240
[Pia] Man, he looks creepy.

21:29.320 --> 21:33.840
It's not every day one of your regulars
turns out to be Vlad the fucking Impaler.

21:33.920 --> 21:37.040
-She was bound to want a souvenir.
-Will she mind if we borrow it?

21:37.120 --> 21:39.640
She won't give a fuck.
She's been dead for four years.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.840
[Davis] We can hook this up.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.640
Mum's Stone Age VCR.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.160
Yeah. Ooh!

21:49.760 --> 21:51.040
It's got a tape in it.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.920
[VCR whirring]

21:55.280 --> 21:57.280

21:58.480 --> 21:59.320

21:59.400 --> 22:01.120
Of course. [chuckles]

22:02.440 --> 22:04.240
Hey, that's your mom's boyfriend.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.560
-Show us his butt.
-[Davis] I think that's enough of that.

22:07.640 --> 22:08.600
[tape stops playing]

22:08.680 --> 22:10.000
Pass us one of Stu's tapes.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.000
Should we dive in?

22:13.080 --> 22:15.840
[reporter 1 on video] It's four days
since Dawn and Simon Challis

22:15.920 --> 22:17.440
were last seen alive

22:17.520 --> 22:20.120
in the tourist hotspot of Loch Henry,

22:20.200 --> 22:23.840
the holiday cottage they'd rented
left eerily abandoned.

22:23.920 --> 22:28.000
Yet, despite extensive searches
of the local area…

22:28.080 --> 22:28.920
That's Dad!

22:29.000 --> 22:31.160
…still no sign of the missing couple.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.360
Locals are mystified.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.560
-It all seems quite odd.
-[Davis] That's Stuart's dad.

22:35.640 --> 22:36.840
Everybody's worried.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.840
I mean, Dawn, the missing girl,
is very attractive, so…

22:40.920 --> 22:42.320
Objectified much?

22:42.400 --> 22:44.600
-Everybody's hoping they'll be okay.
-Jeez.

22:47.360 --> 22:48.720
[Stuart's dad] You should've asked.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.280
About what?

22:53.520 --> 22:54.400
All that

22:55.520 --> 22:59.800
stuff of your mum's that you gave
to Janet's boy for his film or whatever.

22:59.880 --> 23:02.720
Ah, keep your blouse on.
You'll get it back.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.880
-Shouldn't be making movies about it.
-Fuck me, movies.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.160
Iain Adair, I mean, I'd heard of him.

29:08.240 --> 29:12.560
But he's not as well-known
as a Ted Bundy or a Fred West.

29:13.880 --> 29:16.520
So… [exhales] …if we take this anywhere,

29:16.600 --> 29:21.440
the first question any platform,

29:21.520 --> 29:22.640
"What's the hook?"

29:23.760 --> 29:24.800
What's the context?

29:24.880 --> 29:29.200
There is a personal angle.
I mean, his dad was one of the victims.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.200
Uh, yeah. He… he was a policeman.
He was shot at the farm.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.080
So, he was murdered?

29:37.160 --> 29:38.320
He died later.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.160
Of his injuries or…

29:40.800 --> 29:44.000
Not directly,
but… but… but basically, yeah.

29:44.640 --> 29:46.280
[Pia] But he was one of the victims.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.960
-[Davis] Mm.
-This gives him a voice.

29:49.720 --> 29:52.920

the personal angle,

29:57.480 --> 29:58.760

29:58.840 --> 30:02.760
But, um, can you get hold of
any new material?

30:03.480 --> 30:05.640
Police interviews, diaries,
that kind of thing.

30:05.720 --> 30:06.800
We can look into those.
