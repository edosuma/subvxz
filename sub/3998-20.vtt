00:01.815 --> 00:03.131
We're all adults.

00:03.319 --> 00:06.005
What's the harm?
We can do this with dignity,

00:06.182 --> 00:08.980
self-restraint, and dare I say...

00:09.171 --> 00:11.520
- honour.
- The game is True American.

Sorry.

00:24.420 --> 00:26.087
Welcome to Ellis Island, folks.

00:26.122 --> 00:27.222
- You're a Bill,
- Ah!

00:27.256 --> 00:29.190
you're a George,

00:29.225 --> 00:30.959
- you're a Bill.
- Ah.

00:30.993 --> 00:32.761
You're Greek. Get out of here!

00:32.795 --> 00:33.928
What? Why am I Greek?

00:33.963 --> 00:35.029
You're a Greek.
Get out of here!

00:35.064 --> 00:36.231
- Get out of here.
- And you...

00:36.265 --> 00:39.467
- (moans)
- He's got the plague! Scatter!

00:39.502 --> 00:40.902
Hello!

00:40.936 --> 00:44.606
(all shouting)

00:44.640 --> 00:46.574
Taft just sat on you!

00:49.645 --> 00:52.080
My name is Eli Whitney,
and I created the cotton gin.

00:52.114 --> 00:55.417
Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin!
Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin! Gin!

00:55.451 --> 00:57.352

Jessica, did we die?

01:19.508 --> 01:22.343
No. Alive.

01:22.378 --> 01:23.144
Shh...

01:23.179 --> 01:25.180
Turkey bacon.

01:25.214 --> 01:27.615

01:35.991 --> 01:37.759
(smacking lips)
Help me up.

01:37.793 --> 01:40.595
I'm trying.

01:40.629 --> 01:44.299
You're...
(mumbling)

01:44.333 --> 01:46.368
You drink some water.

01:46.402 --> 01:50.004
Aw, son of a bitch,
the water fell on the ground.

01:50.039 --> 01:52.107
(groans)
Here. Here you go.

01:52.141 --> 01:55.377
Drink the water. That's good.

01:55.411 --> 01:56.978
(sucking)

01:57.012 --> 01:58.313
(phone ringing)
Oh, no.

01:58.347 --> 01:59.481
- No.
- Oh, make it stop.

01:59.515 --> 02:01.683
- Jessica, make it stop.
- No!

02:01.717 --> 02:03.551
(groans)

02:03.586 --> 02:05.387
Oh.
(moans)

02:05.421 --> 02:07.789
Hello.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.025
Jess, where are you?
It's Jacob's first birthday.

02:10.059 --> 02:11.526
You're his godmother,
I need you here.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.962
Sir, hi. Who are you?

02:13.996 --> 02:16.264
This is a private residence.

02:16.298 --> 02:18.199
I'll be right there.

02:18.234 --> 02:20.835
(groans, exhales)

02:20.870 --> 02:23.738
(hoarsely):
Hey, Nick. It's me, Jess.

02:23.773 --> 02:25.306
I have really bad news.

02:25.341 --> 02:28.309
We have to go to
a one-year-old's birthday party.

02:28.344 --> 02:30.378
I'm not interested
in that birthday party.

02:30.413 --> 02:32.047
Thank you for the invitation.

02:32.081 --> 02:33.715
Good night.
(groans)

02:33.749 --> 02:35.717
(groans)
I'm so hungover.

02:35.751 --> 02:37.886
- Why today?
- What?

02:37.920 --> 02:39.320
You think it went bad?

02:39.355 --> 02:41.823
We're your new neighbors.

02:43.859 --> 02:48.663
Um, I think y-your bagel
fell out of your mouth.

02:48.698 --> 02:51.199
I'm Jewish.

02:51.233 --> 02:54.269
Why didn't you guys tell me I was
still wearing ladies' sunglasses?

02:54.303 --> 02:57.272
I look like
Magic Johnson's son, EJ.

02:57.306 --> 02:58.640
Hey, you guys, I got a problem.

02:58.674 --> 03:00.875
You know that guy that I'm dating?

03:00.910 --> 03:02.544
Buster, your child bride?

03:02.578 --> 03:04.112
He's 20, okay?
Not that it matters.

03:04.146 --> 03:06.281
Is he smooth all over?
Does he take baths in the sink?

03:06.315 --> 03:08.917
I sent him a bunch
of drunk texts last night.

03:08.951 --> 03:10.852
- What?
- Mmm.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.220
(sighs)
Oh, dear Lord.

03:12.254 --> 03:15.056
- I know.
- "I miss the way that your hands smell"?

03:15.091 --> 03:17.025
Did you write an entire
Jewel song in here?

03:17.059 --> 03:18.093
Is it from <i>Pieces of You?</i>

03:18.127 --> 03:19.894
You want to buy a rabbit with him?

03:19.929 --> 03:20.962
This isn't a text message,

03:20.997 --> 03:22.564
it's a freaking Russian novel.

03:22.598 --> 03:24.132
Okay, well, you know what,
what do I do?

03:24.501 --> 03:27.102
Text him one of the little yellow men.
The-the emoticons.

03:27.136 --> 03:30.238
You know, with the...
with the fa... with the faces.

03:30.272 --> 03:32.207
I hate all of you.

03:32.241 --> 03:34.476
Okay, so we really
tanked it with those babes.

03:34.510 --> 03:35.310
Look, we need to orchestrate

03:35.344 --> 03:36.745
a situation which allows us

03:36.779 --> 03:38.380
to put our best foot forward.

03:38.414 --> 03:39.547
- That's easy. We help 'em move.
- Winston,

03:39.582 --> 03:41.883
Winston... shh.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.752
Why? It makes perfect sense.

03:43.786 --> 03:46.154
Helping a girl move makes you come off
as a doormat, you know what I mean?

03:46.188 --> 03:47.555
Honey, honey, honey, just...

03:47.590 --> 03:49.157
listen to Coach.

03:49.191 --> 03:50.458
Baby, look,

03:50.493 --> 03:52.327
let us handle this,
okay? You go help Cece

03:52.361 --> 03:53.495
with the text messages.

03:53.529 --> 03:54.896
- You know, maybe I will.
- Okay.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.332
But only because I really do
enjoy helping people.

03:57.366 --> 03:59.334
You're gonna be great, buddy.

03:59.368 --> 04:01.670
You're gonna do good things, man.

04:01.704 --> 04:03.104
You think we were too harsh on him?

04:03.139 --> 04:04.172
He makes you. He does.

04:04.206 --> 04:06.041
Don't blame yourself.

04:06.075 --> 04:08.176
(groans)

04:09.612 --> 04:12.414
How the hell did this happen?
(Jess groans)

04:12.448 --> 04:14.482
I found some things
and I put them on.

04:14.517 --> 04:17.452
- (groans) Throw this on.
- Mm.

04:17.486 --> 04:19.654
- Okay. That'll do it.
- Cover up the tops.

04:21.190 --> 04:22.190
You look great.

04:22.224 --> 04:24.926
- (crying)
- No.

04:24.961 --> 04:27.929
- I couldn't have done it without you.
- No, you're...

04:27.964 --> 04:29.931
you're getting emotional. You do
this when you're hungover,

04:29.966 --> 04:31.399
but I'm gonna need you
to stay focused

04:31.434 --> 04:32.834
so we can get to that party.

04:32.868 --> 04:35.170
- Yeah. We just need the gift.
- Yeah.

04:35.204 --> 04:36.104
I got the gift.

04:36.138 --> 04:37.205
All right.

04:39.308 --> 04:40.709
Why is it in the box?
It's supposed to be out

04:40.743 --> 04:42.477
of the box, assembled.

04:42.511 --> 04:44.112
I said I would put it together
before the party,

04:44.146 --> 04:45.680
and it's before the party.
So what's the problem?

04:45.715 --> 04:47.148
Just give me

04:47.183 --> 04:48.550
five minutes.

04:48.584 --> 04:50.251
(pieces clatter)

04:50.286 --> 04:53.154
Ten minutes, tops.

04:53.189 --> 04:56.157
But I got this thing.

04:56.192 --> 04:57.692
This is it.

04:57.727 --> 05:00.695
Christmas morning.

05:00.730 --> 05:04.466
Our little guy waiting
by the fireplace,

05:04.500 --> 05:06.234
but there's no gift.

05:06.269 --> 05:08.737
'Cause Daddy's in the other room
putting it together.

05:08.771 --> 05:11.206
Did you say "our" kid?

05:11.240 --> 05:13.642
Yeah, sometimes I think about
what our kid would be like.

05:13.676 --> 05:15.410
(sniffles) Don't you?

05:15.444 --> 05:17.142
Yeah.

05:17.146 --> 05:18.210
You don't think about the future?

05:18.310 --> 05:20.715
Can we not talk about this
right now? Six hours ago,

05:20.750 --> 05:23.151
I was lapping cognac out
of Winston's hands.

05:23.185 --> 05:25.120
Drink it up, Checkers.
Forget what you saw.

05:25.154 --> 05:28.189
Never talk about anything serious
when you're hungover, Jess.

05:28.224 --> 05:29.824
I don't even really think
about it that much.

05:29.859 --> 05:32.160
I just think about, you know,
passing things. Just...

05:32.194 --> 05:35.397
Nothing specific.
We live in a house by a lake.

05:35.431 --> 05:36.765
- That sounds pretty specific.
- We live in a town

05:36.799 --> 05:38.600
with a sense of history
but not so much history

05:38.634 --> 05:40.902
that the locals are suspicious
of new people.

05:40.937 --> 05:42.737
Two small children

05:42.772 --> 05:45.874
who are so incredibly creative
they named themselves.

05:45.908 --> 05:47.876
We don't need to discipline the
kids 'cause they're so afraid

05:47.910 --> 05:49.411
of disappointing us.

05:49.445 --> 05:51.346
Our house smells like cider.

05:51.380 --> 05:52.681
And if there's a horse out back,

05:52.715 --> 05:55.216
you're not gonna get
any guff from me.

05:55.251 --> 05:58.620
Anyway, that's where I'm at.
(scoffs)

05:58.654 --> 06:00.455
What are you...
what are you thinking?

06:00.489 --> 06:02.223
What, um...

06:02.258 --> 06:04.559
Where do you picture us?

06:04.594 --> 06:06.962
Where do you...
Nick.

06:06.996 --> 06:09.497
Nick.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.443
Mmm, mmm. Oh, God.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.345
I still feel like crap.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.846
Guys, will you, um,
look at this follow-up text

06:19.881 --> 06:21.381
that I'm sending to Buster?

06:21.416 --> 06:23.850
- It's for the little boy?
- Try to be helpful, okay?

06:23.885 --> 06:26.486
- What are we looking at here?
- Are those nursing cats?

06:26.521 --> 06:27.955
Winston said it was funny.

06:27.989 --> 06:29.323
- It's not. It's incoherent.
- No.

06:29.357 --> 06:31.124
It's borderline pornographic.
(sighs)

06:31.159 --> 06:33.293
Wait, those are not cats.
That's a human man!

06:33.328 --> 06:35.028
What is he suck...
What is he sucking on?

06:35.063 --> 06:37.965
- What Web sites are you going to?
- What are you guys doing out here?

06:37.999 --> 06:39.700
Obviously we're creating
an accidental bump-in

06:39.734 --> 06:42.035
with our hot new neighbors.
Elevator's on the move.

06:42.070 --> 06:43.904
You got to go. You're too hot.
You'll confuse them.

06:43.938 --> 06:44.905
(groans)

06:44.939 --> 06:46.406
(elevator dings)

06:46.441 --> 06:48.408
Yes, well, of course.
It's my garden party,

06:48.443 --> 06:50.644
and Zachary Quinto
is not on the list.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.013
Um, you sure
you can handle that, Winston?

06:53.047 --> 06:54.681
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Ooh. Are you sure?

06:54.716 --> 06:56.049
Winston: I'm fine. I'm fine.

06:56.084 --> 06:58.318
To the right a little bit.
Up right.

06:58.353 --> 07:00.254
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay. Thank you so much.

07:00.288 --> 07:03.257
We'll get you some nice cold
lemonade after this, okay?

07:03.291 --> 07:04.291
Ooh, be careful.

07:04.325 --> 07:06.226
Oh! Good Lord.

07:06.261 --> 07:08.262
You know what, we don't have
to talk about the future.

07:08.296 --> 07:10.898
- Let's just put this toy together.
- I want to talk about the future.

07:10.932 --> 07:13.267
- Okay. Great. All right.
- I would love to talk about it. Yes, great.

07:13.301 --> 07:15.669
I always thought it would be
cool to be a long-haul trucker.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.105
You want to be a long-haul
trucker with a family?

07:18.139 --> 07:20.941
No, the family would be
in Montana. Or-or Mars Landing,

07:20.975 --> 07:23.143
you know, if the government
finally steps up.

07:23.177 --> 07:25.579
Where is Mars Landing?

07:25.613 --> 07:27.281
Where is Mars Landing?
It's on M... It's on Mars.

07:27.315 --> 07:29.516
It's the American capital of Mars.

07:29.551 --> 07:32.085
And if you don't think
there's gonna be space travel

07:32.120 --> 07:34.021
in the next 20 years,
then you've got your head

07:34.055 --> 07:35.889
buried in sand, girlie.

07:35.924 --> 07:37.624
It's already basically happening.

07:37.659 --> 07:39.726
I always thought
I'd move back to Portland.

07:39.761 --> 07:41.195
Oh. Portland, Earth?

07:41.229 --> 07:42.930
It's like friendly San Francisco.

07:42.964 --> 07:45.065
Slow food, fast bicycles,

07:45.099 --> 07:46.300
great schools...

07:46.334 --> 07:47.701
Education is very important to me.

07:47.735 --> 07:48.936
That makes me happy.

07:48.970 --> 07:50.270
It's something we agree on.

07:50.305 --> 07:52.873
- I really want my kids to beg for it.
- What?

07:52.907 --> 07:54.374
'Cause if you force a kid into
school, he's gonna hate it.

07:54.409 --> 07:55.175
Oh, no.

07:55.210 --> 07:56.610
If you make a kid work

07:56.644 --> 07:58.478
and sit in the yard
and grind and grind

07:58.513 --> 07:59.313
- and grind...
- What?

07:59.347 --> 08:01.982
eventually, that little kid
is gonna beg for education.

08:02.016 --> 08:03.250
Then you hand it to them

08:03.284 --> 08:05.419
- like the gift that it should be.
- No!

08:05.453 --> 08:06.954
That's why public school's a joke.

08:06.988 --> 08:08.488
I'm so hungover

08:08.523 --> 08:10.224
and my body's shutting down

08:10.258 --> 08:13.093
and nothing you're saying
makes any sense.

08:13.127 --> 08:14.094
There is something serious
I have to tell you

08:14.128 --> 08:15.195
about the future.

08:16.264 --> 08:18.966
The name of my firstborn child

08:19.000 --> 08:21.001
has to be Reginald VelJohnson.

08:21.035 --> 08:22.603
I lost a bet to Schmidt.

08:22.637 --> 08:24.104
Reginald VelJohnson?

08:24.138 --> 08:26.306
That is non-negotiable.
Unfortunately.

08:26.341 --> 08:27.841
The dad from <i>Family Matters?</i>

08:27.876 --> 08:29.176
Well, the actor who plays the dad.

08:29.210 --> 08:30.444
The dad is Carl Winslow.

08:30.478 --> 08:31.845
What was the bet on?

08:31.880 --> 08:33.280
I said I could flip a big pancake...

08:33.313 --> 08:34.982
(laughing):
...and I couldn't.

08:37.986 --> 08:40.120
(muffled):
How is this going to work?!

08:40.154 --> 08:41.554
The only upside is

08:41.589 --> 08:44.958
the original name
was gonna be Ass Baby,

08:44.993 --> 08:47.661
and I kind of talked my way
out of that one.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.530
All of the guys in this building
are so sweet.

08:49.564 --> 08:50.831
- It's no problem, yeah.
- Couldn't be easier, really.

08:50.865 --> 08:52.199
Just a p...
piece of cake.

08:52.233 --> 08:54.635
Coach: We love it.

08:54.669 --> 08:55.783
You know, it was my idea
to help move.

08:55.943 --> 08:58.005
The only reason we're doing this
is because you forced us to.

08:58.039 --> 08:59.306
If we don't help now, we'll look bad.

08:59.340 --> 09:00.807
Yeah, now they're gonna think of us

09:00.842 --> 09:02.643
as "nice" and "helpful."
Nightmare.

09:03.478 --> 09:04.311
Hey.

09:04.345 --> 09:05.379
Hey.

09:05.413 --> 09:06.346
Coach: Oh, cool!

09:06.381 --> 09:08.248
Uh... your brother?

09:08.283 --> 09:09.349
Actually, it's my boyfriend.

09:09.384 --> 09:12.319
Yet he's not here to help you move.

09:12.353 --> 09:14.188
- He's out of the country.
- Oh!

09:14.222 --> 09:15.656
Afghanistan.
Second tour.

09:15.690 --> 09:17.224
- Ah...
- Oh...

09:17.258 --> 09:18.392
Please thank him for,

09:18.426 --> 09:19.893
- uh, for his service.
- Yeah.

09:19.928 --> 09:21.528
Are you and your boyfriend

09:21.563 --> 09:23.564
and Michelle and her boyfriend
gonna go on a, like,

09:23.598 --> 09:24.898
double date kind of thing

09:24.933 --> 09:26.300
whenever he gets back
from Afghanistan?

09:26.334 --> 09:27.801
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

09:27.836 --> 09:29.536
She's not really
the relationship type.

09:29.571 --> 09:30.671
- Oh.
- Okay.

09:30.705 --> 09:32.372
I'm just having fun right now.

09:32.407 --> 09:34.274
I feel you. No, I feel you.
(laughs)

09:34.309 --> 09:35.809
Girl, I want to feel you...

09:35.844 --> 09:37.044
And then there was one.

09:37.078 --> 09:38.912
May the best man win.

09:38.947 --> 09:40.180
- I am also involved in this.
- Winston, get out of here.

09:40.215 --> 09:41.748
What is your problem?

09:41.783 --> 09:43.383
And then there were three guys...

09:43.418 --> 09:44.751
Jess: Here's what I'm saying:

09:44.786 --> 09:48.755
Reginald is way too shy
to beg for an education.

09:48.790 --> 09:51.191
He's very sensitive,
and when he's out on the horse,

09:51.226 --> 09:52.893
all he's doing is staring at leaves

09:52.927 --> 09:54.328
and writing poems about them.

09:54.362 --> 09:56.029
Why do I have a horse?
You know how many

09:56.064 --> 09:57.898
people are killed on
a horse every year?

09:57.932 --> 09:59.766
Hey! You're not listening
to what I'm saying.

09:59.801 --> 10:01.401
What I'm saying is,

10:01.436 --> 10:04.938
I'm not gonna take Reginald
out on the damn lake

10:04.973 --> 10:07.407
when you're out on
your space truck...

10:07.442 --> 10:09.343
- We're not living by the lake.
- (exasperated sigh)

10:09.377 --> 10:11.011
Why would I spend my hard-earned

10:11.045 --> 10:12.713
truck driver money
on an Earth house?

10:12.747 --> 10:14.515
- You make up so much science fiction...
- Science...

10:14.549 --> 10:16.750
...but you know
nothing about science.

10:16.785 --> 10:18.252
- Do you know what science is?
- Okay, science is more of a belief

10:18.286 --> 10:20.354
- than anything else.
- No. Do you know what science is?

10:20.388 --> 10:21.955
- Yes. What you believe in.
- Have you ever taken a science class?

10:21.990 --> 10:23.557
I've taught two at a community college.

10:23.591 --> 10:25.959
When did you teach science
at a community college?

10:25.994 --> 10:28.228
I made that up. I didn't think
you were gonna fact-check me.

10:28.263 --> 10:29.563
My kids are not gonna

10:29.597 --> 10:31.131
beg for an education, okay?

10:31.166 --> 10:32.633
They're gonna be forced
to go to school

10:32.667 --> 10:34.067
just like everybody else

10:34.102 --> 10:35.702
and they're gonna hate it!

10:35.737 --> 10:38.138
Can I actually be very real
with you for a second?

10:38.173 --> 10:39.807
- Yes.
- Here's what I really believe:

10:39.841 --> 10:42.876
You can create
a plan for your life,

10:42.911 --> 10:45.445
and then crazy things
get thrown at you,

10:45.480 --> 10:48.348
and that, by the way,
is the closest thing

10:48.383 --> 10:50.150
that I have to a plan.

10:50.185 --> 10:52.085
So maybe it's crazy
to talk about being

10:52.120 --> 10:53.954
an intergalactic truck driver.

10:53.988 --> 10:55.189
But what I think is crazier

10:55.223 --> 10:56.757
is trying to plan

10:56.791 --> 10:58.459
every single detail of our future.

10:58.493 --> 11:00.661
I think it's crazy not to.
I just can't

11:00.695 --> 11:02.663
- live that way.
- I guess we just disagree.

11:02.697 --> 11:05.065
Well, we never agree
on anything, ever, Nick.

11:05.100 --> 11:07.233
Why are we doing this
right now, Jess? We're hungover.

11:07.385 --> 11:09.937
Just because I want to know
we're going in the same direction,

11:09.971 --> 11:11.438
- that we're on the same page.
- Yes, we are.

11:11.473 --> 11:13.807
Well, we live on different planets!

11:13.842 --> 11:15.709
Oh... You're talking
about the fake future!

11:18.713 --> 11:20.047
I just...

11:21.149 --> 11:22.950
I guess we want
different things.

11:22.984 --> 11:24.118
Clearly, we do.

11:24.152 --> 11:25.152
- Clearly, we do.
- All right,

11:25.186 --> 11:26.153
so what are you saying?

11:26.187 --> 11:27.187
Should we just break up?

11:29.000 --> 11:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:37.812 --> 11:39.580
(both laughing)

11:41.183 --> 11:42.417
Yeah, right.
Like we're just

11:42.451 --> 11:43.885
- gonna break up!
- Just break up!

11:43.919 --> 11:45.086
Over what?

11:45.120 --> 11:46.654
You don't like lakes,

11:46.689 --> 11:47.822
I don't like space.
That's okay!

11:47.856 --> 11:49.457
This is not why people break up!

11:49.491 --> 11:51.459
I break up with thee, sir!

11:51.493 --> 11:52.694
(bad Australian accent):
I break up...

11:52.728 --> 11:53.861
I don't do voices.

11:53.896 --> 11:55.697
- I think I'm still drunk.
- (laughs)

11:55.731 --> 11:56.864
Let's just get to the party.

11:56.899 --> 11:58.099
- Build this toy and go.
- Yeah.

11:58.133 --> 11:59.334
Let's do it.
We are

11:59.368 --> 12:00.635
an unstoppable toy-building team!

12:00.669 --> 12:02.236
Yes, we are.

12:02.271 --> 12:03.871
Yeah.

12:03.906 --> 12:05.173
All right, well, first hurdle:

12:05.207 --> 12:06.641
the instructions
are written upside-down.

12:06.675 --> 12:09.143
Ah, it's a false alarm.

12:09.178 --> 12:10.645
Okay, hit me.
What do you got?

12:10.679 --> 12:12.380
Okay, take the thing

12:12.414 --> 12:14.215
- that looks like a meth lab
- This thing?

12:14.250 --> 12:15.650
...and put it in the thing

12:15.684 --> 12:16.884
that looks like a pipe bomb.

12:16.919 --> 12:18.820
- Oh, hey!
- Hey!

12:18.854 --> 12:20.822
Now we're cooking with gas.

12:20.856 --> 12:22.490
- We're a good team.
- I agree.

12:22.524 --> 12:23.491
You know what, Jess...
and if you want to move

12:23.525 --> 12:24.759
to Portland in the future,

12:24.793 --> 12:26.094
then we're gonna move to Portland.

12:26.128 --> 12:27.562
You know, we'll live by the lake.

12:27.596 --> 12:28.897
I'll learn to fish,

12:28.931 --> 12:29.998
and me and Reginald will start

12:30.032 --> 12:31.933
a newsletter, you know...

12:31.967 --> 12:33.401
"Lake Father, Lake Son."

12:33.435 --> 12:34.669
And you know what?

12:34.703 --> 12:36.070
If you want to be
a long-haul trucker,

12:36.105 --> 12:37.939
I can deal with that
for six months, tops.

12:37.973 --> 12:39.707
- Yes!
- Um, this piece is a little sticky,

12:39.742 --> 12:41.509
- but I think I can just jam it.
- Ah!

12:41.543 --> 12:43.278
- What did you just do, Jess?
- Oh. Well, I put

12:43.312 --> 12:45.079
the swastika in the guillotine.

12:45.114 --> 12:47.081
How is this a children's toy?

12:47.116 --> 12:49.450
Why is it so brittle?

12:49.485 --> 12:50.852
What is that?

12:50.886 --> 12:52.720
I'm not sure what I've been doing.

12:52.755 --> 12:54.389
(sighs)
Hey, Michelle.

12:54.423 --> 12:55.623
Hey.

12:55.658 --> 12:57.692
You guys are lifesavers.

12:57.726 --> 12:58.927
You have beautiful taste, by the way.

12:58.961 --> 13:00.194
Really. Is this early Californian?

13:00.229 --> 13:01.930
You know, this color, actually,

13:01.964 --> 13:03.398
it symbolizes a woman's fertility.

13:03.432 --> 13:05.767
Huh. I was pregnant once.

13:05.801 --> 13:07.402
Cool.

13:07.436 --> 13:08.703
- What-what do you know?
- Yeah.

13:08.737 --> 13:09.771
- Thank you, guys.
- No, thank you.

13:09.805 --> 13:11.372
- So much.
- You bet.

13:11.407 --> 13:13.641
- All right. Talk to you la...
- You see her blink at me?

13:13.676 --> 13:14.642
Wait, you think that was a sex blink?

13:14.677 --> 13:15.877
That wasn't a sex blink.

13:15.911 --> 13:17.212
That was definitely a sex blink, dude.

13:17.246 --> 13:19.147
You would not know a sex blink
if it blinked you in the sex.

13:19.181 --> 13:20.882
- What?
- It's over already, man.

13:20.916 --> 13:22.383
You don't have a shot.

13:22.418 --> 13:25.053
'Cause the chicks you pull are gremlins.

13:25.087 --> 13:26.621
You did not just talk about my chicks.

13:26.655 --> 13:28.122
My chicks look great.

13:28.157 --> 13:30.024
Just like me.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.726
I'm saying my chicks

13:31.760 --> 13:33.595
- literally look just like me.
- All of 'em.

13:33.629 --> 13:34.829
In varying color,

13:34.864 --> 13:36.097
but they look like me.

13:36.131 --> 13:37.365
That is super awkward,

13:37.399 --> 13:38.900
and I don't feel like you know what

13:38.934 --> 13:40.902
- you're saying right now.
- Whoops!

13:40.936 --> 13:42.403
Oh...
Coach!

13:42.438 --> 13:43.638
Oh, man, I can't believe

13:43.672 --> 13:44.973
you just did that to her vase.

13:45.941 --> 13:47.675
Whoa! Dude!

13:47.710 --> 13:48.943
I will knock you out
where you stand,

13:48.978 --> 13:50.144
and you...
in the ground.

13:50.179 --> 13:51.646
I will pound you from the side!

13:51.680 --> 13:53.348
I will pound you from the back!
That sounded weird.

13:53.382 --> 13:54.983
Once again, Schmidt has found himself

13:55.017 --> 13:57.085
in a position where he is infuriated!

13:57.119 --> 13:58.486
I will fight your face!

13:58.521 --> 14:00.321
I will freak out so hard

14:00.356 --> 14:01.923
on you right now, you don't
even know, on your face.

14:01.957 --> 14:03.124
Winston: What are you two...

14:03.158 --> 14:04.859
Oh, my goodness. Guys!

14:04.894 --> 14:07.295
Her study-abroad mirror?

14:07.329 --> 14:08.763
Her dream vase?

14:08.797 --> 14:10.198
Come on, guys.

14:10.232 --> 14:11.833
(huffs)

14:11.867 --> 14:13.768
Have some self-respect.

14:13.802 --> 14:15.537
We're...

14:15.571 --> 14:17.005
Nick: Hey, Jess?

14:17.039 --> 14:18.673
I don't think that belongs there.

14:18.707 --> 14:20.508
That's why it doesn't fit in.

14:20.543 --> 14:23.344
Well, I don't think this
water bottle goes here, either.

14:23.379 --> 14:24.812
But you put it there.

14:24.847 --> 14:26.447
Well, why did we take
the toy out of the box?

14:26.482 --> 14:28.049
We could have just given
the box to the kid.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.051
What does he know?
He's one.

14:30.085 --> 14:31.706
He eats pennies.
And he poos in his pants.

14:31.806 --> 14:34.052
Because not putting
the toy together is lazy.

14:34.087 --> 14:36.524
- So, if we can't put the toy together...
- I-I know, but it's not gonna fit.

14:36.559 --> 14:37.553
You can't just keep
pushing it because it...

14:37.723 --> 14:38.988
Oh, God.

14:39.023 --> 14:41.629
- Okay, where's the tape?
- Oh, we used all the tape.

14:41.664 --> 14:44.165
- Oh, you used all the tape.
- Yeah, to fix the things that you broke.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.534
- You used a lot of duct tape.
- Actually you broke a lot of pieces.

14:46.569 --> 14:47.902
(laughs)

14:47.937 --> 14:49.737
All right, give it to me.
I'm gonna use a lighter.

14:49.772 --> 14:52.340
And I'm gonna melt the plastic.
I'm gonna weld it together.

14:52.374 --> 14:53.741
What? You don't think
that's a good idea?

14:53.776 --> 14:56.211
No, you should, I think
you should try it.

14:56.245 --> 14:58.413
I also like doing Zippo tricks.

15:02.251 --> 15:05.030
- Ow! Aah, I burned my finger!
- What happened?! Are you okay?

15:05.065 --> 15:06.988
Yeah, it's fine.
My skin's a little bubbly.

15:07.022 --> 15:08.656
Well, I knew that was a bad idea.

15:08.691 --> 15:09.657
Then why didn't you say anything?

15:09.692 --> 15:10.992
Why didn't you put the toy together

15:11.026 --> 15:13.328
when I gave it to you two weeks ago?

15:13.362 --> 15:14.896
Because I'm not Santa Claus!

15:14.930 --> 15:16.731
I don't just put toys together

15:16.765 --> 15:18.700
two weeks in advance!
And also,

15:18.734 --> 15:21.503
it's none of my business what
they want to do with the toy.

15:21.537 --> 15:22.871
Maybe they want to return it.

15:22.905 --> 15:24.005
Maybe they want to put it

15:24.039 --> 15:25.273
together as a family.

15:25.307 --> 15:27.942
That is not my business.

15:27.977 --> 15:29.644
What do you want from me, Jess?

15:29.678 --> 15:31.513
I just want you to take
a little more responsibility.

15:31.547 --> 15:32.847
Just a little bit more.

15:32.882 --> 15:34.682
And I want you to have
a little faith in me!

15:34.717 --> 15:37.018
I've gotten this far in my life.

15:37.052 --> 15:38.553
And I'm doing just fine.

15:40.122 --> 15:41.756
I mean, for the most part.

15:41.790 --> 15:43.057
There's definitely a few
blunders here and there

15:43.092 --> 15:44.859
that we could look past.

15:44.894 --> 15:45.960
Whatever...

15:45.995 --> 15:47.729
The blanket's on fire!

15:47.763 --> 15:49.631
I can see that, Jess.
Go get a bucket.

15:49.665 --> 15:50.732
Where is it? In the kitchen?

15:50.766 --> 15:51.733
No, that's for meat.

15:51.767 --> 15:52.867
We need a different bucket.

15:52.902 --> 15:53.868
Oh, right!

15:53.903 --> 15:55.136
The famous meat bucket!

15:55.171 --> 15:56.871
You said the meat bucket
was a brilliant idea!

15:56.906 --> 15:58.206
Why would I think an unrefrigerated

15:58.240 --> 16:01.309
bucket of meat was a good idea?!

16:01.343 --> 16:04.712
To taste what meat tasted like
before electricity!

16:04.747 --> 16:06.214
Why would you want that?!

16:06.248 --> 16:07.615
Why did you say it was brilliant!?

16:07.650 --> 16:09.651
Because, Nick...

16:09.685 --> 16:12.520
if I was always honest with you...

16:13.656 --> 16:16.491
then we would never stop fighting.

16:17.660 --> 16:19.427
(smoke alarm beeping)

16:19.462 --> 16:20.728
- Let's go!
- We have to go!

16:20.763 --> 16:22.230
Wait, my hat!

16:22.264 --> 16:24.766
What?
My hat.

16:28.313 --> 16:29.880
So sorry. I'm sorry.
So sorry. Sorry.

16:29.914 --> 16:31.648
It was uncool.

16:31.683 --> 16:32.883
I'm so sorry!
Do you need...?

16:32.917 --> 16:34.384
Here, do you want...? Oh.

16:34.419 --> 16:36.787
- How did this happen?
- It was Winston's fault.

16:36.821 --> 16:37.955
He just ca... he carries
things wrong.

16:37.989 --> 16:39.890
What?!

16:39.924 --> 16:42.626
I have heard just
about enough from you two.

16:42.660 --> 16:43.660
What? Ow!

16:43.695 --> 16:45.329
Schmidt: Winston!

16:45.363 --> 16:47.731
Girls, I know you're
both smart enough

16:47.765 --> 16:49.433
to know exactly
who broke your things.

16:49.467 --> 16:50.767
It's the same two clowns

16:50.802 --> 16:52.236
who've been trying
to sex Michelle

16:52.270 --> 16:54.171
every which way from Tuesday.

16:54.205 --> 16:55.539
I mean, I ain't gonna lie.
I've been trying

16:55.573 --> 16:57.841
to sex you every which way
from Tuesday myself.

16:57.876 --> 16:59.076
I'd be crazy not to, Michelle.

16:59.110 --> 17:01.011
You're a very beautiful woman.

17:01.045 --> 17:02.646
You have crazy witch eyes,
and I dig it.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.948
You're like a witch!
(laughs) You know.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.717
But I'm a good guy.

17:08.887 --> 17:10.319
Now, if you'll excuse me,

17:10.355 --> 17:11.922
I have a job to do.

17:11.955 --> 17:14.324
My name is Winston Bishop.

17:14.358 --> 17:16.326
Welcome to the building.

17:16.361 --> 17:18.795
Whoa, Winston, I would
not... that's a...

17:18.829 --> 17:19.630
- Winston, what are you doing?
- That's a big...

17:19.664 --> 17:20.830
(roars)

17:20.865 --> 17:22.699
- Okay.
- Aah!

17:22.733 --> 17:25.536
- Oh! Whoa!
- Son of a...

17:25.569 --> 17:27.271
Winston, you do know that the
building's on fire, right?

17:27.305 --> 17:29.540
I got this! Move, move!

17:29.574 --> 17:30.807
Buster: Cece, hey.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.309
Oh, hey, um,

17:32.343 --> 17:33.977
I didn't think you would
pick up the phone.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.512
I'll-I'll make this quick.

17:35.547 --> 17:36.947
'Cause I'm sure you hate
talking on the phone.

17:36.981 --> 17:38.715
Oh, I actually do.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.317
'Cause I'd much rather,

17:40.351 --> 17:41.952
um, talk in person.

17:41.986 --> 17:43.887
You know? Face to face?

17:43.922 --> 17:46.356
(laughs)
What are you doing here?

17:46.391 --> 17:49.059
I just, I was, uh, walking
over here to see you.

17:49.093 --> 17:52.029
Mm-hmm.
And then you called me.

17:52.063 --> 17:54.398
Didn't all those texts
really freak you out?

17:54.432 --> 17:55.866
Oh, no, no, no, no.
They freaked me out.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.467
I thought you were gonna murder me.

17:57.502 --> 18:00.337
You know, I called my mother,
changed my locks.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.339
Then I kind of, you know,
had a change of heart,

18:02.373 --> 18:04.341
and I thought, "Well, you
know, I like this girl."

18:04.375 --> 18:05.976
I'd much rather just come

18:06.010 --> 18:07.477
and look at you with my eyes.

18:07.512 --> 18:08.812
And talk to you with my face.

18:08.847 --> 18:11.481
If you ever got off the damn phone.

18:13.218 --> 18:14.885
- Yeah.
- Right?

18:14.919 --> 18:16.920
- I, mm-hmm. I understand.
- Hi, Cece. How are you?

18:16.955 --> 18:18.455
- Hungover?
- Yes.

18:18.489 --> 18:20.557
Would you like to come
and get some pancakes?

18:20.592 --> 18:21.725
Yeah, I could, I could
use some pancakes.

18:21.759 --> 18:22.726
It's gonna be a bouncy ride.

18:22.760 --> 18:23.760
My kangaroo's around the corner.

18:23.795 --> 18:24.995
(laughs)

18:25.029 --> 18:27.097
But I did bring an extra
helmet. You're lucky.

18:27.131 --> 18:28.665
(grunts)

18:28.700 --> 18:31.401
All right.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.072
Nick, why is this so hard?

18:35.106 --> 18:37.341
I don't want to fight all the time.

18:37.375 --> 18:39.776
I don't know, and it's awful.

18:41.546 --> 18:44.181
Do you ever miss when
we were just friends, Jess?

18:44.215 --> 18:46.083
And there wasn't this pressure

18:46.117 --> 18:47.084
to be together and to be...

18:47.118 --> 18:48.452
- Be different people?
- Yes.

18:48.486 --> 18:50.854
Be different people.

18:50.889 --> 18:52.389
I'm sorry, but I'm not
that guy who's gonna

18:52.423 --> 18:54.558
put the toy together.
That's just not me.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.160
I'm the kind of guy who's
gonna leave it in the box.

18:56.194 --> 18:57.427
I don't want you to be that guy.

18:57.462 --> 18:58.962
I-I want you to be yourself.

18:58.997 --> 19:00.964
I want you to be yourself.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.536
Are we...?

19:05.570 --> 19:07.971
(laughs): No! I love you!

19:08.006 --> 19:10.307
- Well, I love you, too.
- More than I've ever loved anybody.

19:10.341 --> 19:12.809
But what if that's the only thing
we have in common?

19:22.187 --> 19:23.954
(sniffs)

19:25.757 --> 19:28.926
I miss my friend.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.094
I really miss my friend, too.

19:33.264 --> 19:35.766
So, what does that mean?

19:35.800 --> 19:37.701
Are we...?

19:37.735 --> 19:40.003
Yeah.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.774
(quiet laugh)

19:58.456 --> 20:00.691
(quietly): Earn this.

20:00.725 --> 20:02.459
Was that <i>Saving Private Ryan?</i>

20:02.494 --> 20:05.095
It was. It was a hu-huge moment
in that movie.

20:05.129 --> 20:07.297
And I just, I know this is a moment.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.466
(both laugh)

20:09.501 --> 20:12.536
So, um, I'll walk you
to your room then, I guess.

20:28.553 --> 20:30.921
(sniffs)

20:38.763 --> 20:40.030
(sniffs)

20:58.416 --> 21:00.584
- Schmidt is living in my room.
- Schmidt's in your room, yeah.

21:00.618 --> 21:01.585
Yeah.

21:01.619 --> 21:03.687
Do you think I could...?

21:03.721 --> 21:05.522
- Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's cool.

21:10.795 --> 21:11.862
(door shuts)

21:13.565 --> 21:15.699
Jess?

21:15.733 --> 21:18.402
Jess, you didn't have to run away.

21:18.436 --> 21:20.237
I don't know
what you're so afraid of.

21:20.271 --> 21:23.340
It's just a man doing full
downward facing dog in the nude.

21:23.374 --> 21:26.910
It's a couple of testicles
just hanging upside down.

21:26.945 --> 21:28.679
(quiet laugh)

21:28.713 --> 21:31.381
I can hear you laughing in there.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.987
Yeah, you liked it.

21:34.329 --> 21:35.379
You telling Nick about it?

21:36.961 --> 21:37.983
What's he saying?
