00:00.083 --> 00:02.001
[Mac] Previously on
Commander in Chief:

00:02.085 --> 00:05.464
I'm sorry, Mr. Templeton, but you'll
need to deplane to the rear door.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.341
What? He's the speaker of the house.

00:07.424 --> 00:10.802
This is standard protocol.
I apologize for any inconvenience.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.596
- Let me speak to Jim.
- Jayne.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.933
Whatever your gal wants.
It's not the time.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.146
- Mike.
- It's OK. I got some right here.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.981
- Mike, no, I...
- It's OK.

00:23.065 --> 00:25.025
- Mike, you know what?
- It's OK, it's OK.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.277
No, Mike. [sighs]

00:27.945 --> 00:30.030
I don't know. I just...

00:30.113 --> 00:32.824
I... [sighs] I'm sorry, I just can't.

00:32.908 --> 00:35.869
I'm gonna come back positive.
From the drug screening.

00:35.953 --> 00:36.954
Pardon me?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.498
When the tests come back,
I'm gonna come up...

00:39.581 --> 00:42.125
Vince, stop.
Now you need to get a lawyer.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.378
It's not for coke or meth
or anything.

00:44.461 --> 00:48.215
- Vince...
- It's... I'm HIV-positive.

00:50.342 --> 00:51.677
My God, Vince.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.887
I don't want you to go to New York.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.139
I don't want you to be
baseball commissioner.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.225
I want you to stay here, with me.

00:58.308 --> 00:59.810
I'd like that.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.479
What's my title?

01:04.022 --> 01:06.149
I haven't given it any thought.

01:07.818 --> 01:10.028
[Mac] The people elected me
to this position,

01:10.112 --> 01:12.489
and only the people
and their representatives

01:12.573 --> 01:13.949
can ask me to step down.

01:14.032 --> 01:17.578
I will never apologize for doing my job.

01:17.661 --> 01:21.957
If anything, I only promise
to do it better.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.709
The question is, can she?

01:23.792 --> 01:26.628
The president,
largely perceived as a lame duck,

01:26.712 --> 01:30.716
did get a four-point bump after that
impromptu sit-down with the press.

01:30.799 --> 01:33.260
But she's got no friends on the Hill.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.179
How will Mackenzie Allen
get her agenda passed?

01:36.263 --> 01:38.307
[groans] Shut it off.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.101
- [man] ...what is this president...?
- [TV turns off]

01:41.184 --> 01:43.186
How'd it go with
Senate Leadership today?

01:43.270 --> 01:46.773
- Not part of the four-point bump.
- Did you veto the gun control bill?

01:46.857 --> 01:50.402
I have reservations about the liability
shields. What do you think?

01:51.403 --> 01:55.240
Are you asking my opinion
on the record or off the record?

01:56.074 --> 01:58.410
What does that mean?

01:58.493 --> 02:00.454
It means you said you
were gonna offer me

02:00.537 --> 02:02.539
a legitimate role
in your administration,

02:02.623 --> 02:05.667
and instead you're asking me
to be secretary of pillow talk.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.336
Rod, I am way too tired for this, OK?

02:08.419 --> 02:10.672
I just asked what you think.

02:10.756 --> 02:13.091
OK, you wanna know what I think?

02:13.759 --> 02:16.303
Because I'm gonna be honest with you,

02:16.386 --> 02:18.764
which no one else
in the West Wing is gonna be.

02:20.057 --> 02:23.018
You have no focus.
No forward motion. No game plan.

02:23.101 --> 02:26.647
The guy who could help you make one,
who wants to help you make one,

02:26.730 --> 02:29.566
he's too busy picking out drapes
for the Vermeil Room.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.027
- When we talked...
- Is that what it was? Talk?

02:32.110 --> 02:34.738
- No, I'm just saying...
- You asked me to stay. I stayed.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.824
- I'm not firing Jim Gardner.
- I'm not asking for his job.

02:37.908 --> 02:41.787
Look, call it whatever you want.
Political director, senior advisor,

02:41.870 --> 02:43.664
deputy chief of "got your back"

02:43.747 --> 02:47.584
but make me a part
of this administration, Mac.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.378
Officially.

02:49.461 --> 02:52.839
Or this isn't gonna work,
professionally...

02:52.923 --> 02:54.508
...or personally.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.892
[water splashing]

03:17.989 --> 03:21.159
- Are you coming with me to school?
- Not today. Here you go.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.746
- Why?
- Well, I've got things to do, honey.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.415
Like what?

03:26.498 --> 03:28.792
- 'Morning.
- Yeah, good morning.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.088
- Get up!
- Huh?

03:33.171 --> 03:34.798
- Come on.
- Yeah.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.801
- Mommy!
- Hi, baby.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.303
- Did you eat breakfast yet?
- Uh-uh.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.889
Um, why don't you go on ahead
and get started.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.975
- I need to talk to Daddy first.
- OK.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.772
OK, look, uh, I've been thinking.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.649
And not just overnight.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.985
For weeks now, really.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.987
You're right.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.656
I... I have always looked to you,

03:59.740 --> 04:03.326
counted on you, needed you.
We are in this together.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.872
And if other people can't handle that,

04:06.955 --> 04:08.206
the hell with 'em.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.752
So...

04:12.753 --> 04:14.212
So yes.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.048
And I report directly to you.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.593
I will make sure that's understood.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.849
[Vince] I can't believe
we work in the White House.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.268
- Yeah. Pretty awesome.
- It never gets old.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.771
Are you and Josh coming over
to the house tonight?

04:30.854 --> 04:32.564
- Kelly! Sure.
- It's me, OK?

04:32.647 --> 04:35.150
Contrary to popular belief,
the walls are not bugged.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.902
- [Jim] Vince.
- Yes, sir.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.278
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.738
And bring red wine tonight.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.657
- Something with "reserve" on the label.
- [Vince] OK.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.076
So how can I help you, Mr. Gardner?

04:46.244 --> 04:48.663
I got the results
of your drug test back.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.458
- You're clear.
- [sighs]

04:52.459 --> 04:53.794
That's a relief. Thank you.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.505
That said, there may be issues
with the Secret Service.

04:56.588 --> 04:59.674
Do they have to be told?
Being that I came back clean.

04:59.758 --> 05:03.386
The government has no right to ask
about my orientation or HIV status.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.723
- You really wanna walk this tightrope?
- I don't have much choice.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.768
- I don't think that's true anymore.
- It is in my world.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.063
Where I come from,

05:13.146 --> 05:16.817
it would be easier to be you than me.

05:18.819 --> 05:23.406
I'll have an off-the-record talk with
the Service. I'll take it from there.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.866
Thank you.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.415
We aren't going on record
so you can create a nice food fight

05:32.499 --> 05:34.626
between the speaker and the president.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.254
She seems quite good
at generating her own negatives.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.340
Look, we'll talk tomorrow at lunch.
Hawk 'n' Dove.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.509
Get The Post to buy.

05:42.592 --> 05:46.388
They want conflict, tension,
palace intrigue.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.681
Who are we to disappoint?

05:47.764 --> 05:51.268
Harrington's trying to come up
with opp research on the president.

05:51.351 --> 05:54.312
- Using the utmost discretion.
- Always. He's crazy.

05:54.396 --> 05:57.649
All those opposition research guys
are, but he's discreet.

05:57.732 --> 06:01.236
You know, she was
never really properly vetted,

06:01.319 --> 06:03.655
not like a real president.

06:03.738 --> 06:07.701
The press kept blowing her kisses
on the campaign trail.

06:07.784 --> 06:11.663
We're not having much luck finding
anything on her press secretary,

06:11.746 --> 06:15.876
other than that she was her speechwriter
before, which speaks volumes.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.545
- [chuckles]
- We found a little nugget on her aide.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.423
Vince Taylor. He's been
with her campaign from the start.

06:21.506 --> 06:25.260
- The airplane guy?
- Mmm. Gay guy.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.679
Apparently had a bad relationship
when he was 19.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.932
- His parents filed a restraining order.
- Oh, bloody hell.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.560
I think half the people here
are homosexual.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.730
Staff and members.
It's no big deal, Jayne.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.901
We got his pharmaceutical company to do
a little digging with local drugstores.

06:40.984 --> 06:45.155
Seems that the aide to the president
pays cash for his antiretrovirals.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.574
He's HIV-positive.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.910
Yeah. Sad.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.996
Very.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.165
Hmm.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.208
Hm, hm, hm, hm.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.337
Hm, hm, hm.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.313
[chattering]

07:18.396 --> 07:19.981
Mike.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.027
- So...
- So?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.280
Um...

07:27.364 --> 07:30.408
...is everything... is everything OK?

07:30.492 --> 07:32.786
Yeah, sure.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.871
You don't sound OK.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.083
Don't like being led on, I guess.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.835
I didn't. I mean...

07:41.419 --> 07:42.629
I mean, you said it was OK.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.423
Yeah, well, didn't want you
freaking out on me.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.093
Later, OK?

07:48.176 --> 07:49.761
Wait. That's it?

07:49.844 --> 07:51.930
Pretty much, yeah.

07:52.013 --> 07:56.226
Mike, I'm sorry. It's just...
I wasn't ready.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.979
I... Come on, we were at a party.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.400
Let me know if you change your mind.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.071
Mike?

08:10.907 --> 08:12.826
You're a real jerk, you know that?

08:14.911 --> 08:17.247
[bell ringing]

08:18.748 --> 08:20.333
Got a call from Governor Strama.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.836
The people of the Granite State
think it's time...

08:22.919 --> 08:24.254
[knocking]

08:25.296 --> 08:26.923
[both] Madam President.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.134
Relax, it's just the leader
of the free world.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.346
We were just talking about putting
some travel on your schedule.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.140
- Carlos, can you give us a minute?
- Oh, of course, ma'am.

08:39.059 --> 08:40.020
[door closes]

08:40.102 --> 08:42.480
- Is there a problem?
- [Mac] I don't think so.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.692
Jim, I'm moving Rod
into the West Wing.

08:47.569 --> 08:50.321
I see. In what role?

08:50.405 --> 08:51.656
Strategic planning.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.493
Would it be petty if I said
that seemed like a big part

08:55.577 --> 08:57.412
of the chief of staff's job?

08:57.495 --> 09:00.957
Jim, you have the hardest job
in Washington,

09:01.041 --> 09:03.626
working for a president with no allies.

09:03.710 --> 09:07.714
You have to, every day, build
a coalition just to get anything done.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.174
You're chief of staff,

09:09.257 --> 09:13.094
you're de facto
Independent Party head, magician.

09:13.178 --> 09:16.264
This is gonna help you.
It'll help all of us.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.100
Completely your call, ma'am.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.226
Thank you.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.396
- Good morning, everyone.
- Madam President.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.273
Please, be seated.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.484
We have lots to discuss.

09:28.860 --> 09:29.861
Thank you.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.700
We all came to the White House
two years ago

09:35.784 --> 09:38.369
with Teddy Bridges, myself included,

09:38.453 --> 09:39.871
my staff included.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.998
It took time for all of us to heal,

09:42.082 --> 09:44.209
to work through the tragedy
of his death,

09:44.292 --> 09:47.253
all while keeping the business
of the country running.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.547
We've done extraordinarily well.

09:49.631 --> 09:53.718
What we haven't been able to do,
to move beyond, is reacting.

09:53.802 --> 09:56.679
The time has come
to transition this administration

09:56.763 --> 09:59.557
from one of mourning to one of action.

09:59.641 --> 10:03.603
With that in mind, I would like
to welcome Rod Calloway to our staff.

10:03.686 --> 10:07.232
Effective today, Rod is in charge
of strategic planning.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.114
Thank you.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.826
All right. Let's get started. Jim.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.954
Got cornered by Don Hamilton
at the Corcoran last night.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.207
He wants the president to have
the first Ed Board meeting at The Post.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.544
[Kelly] The Times might be a smarter
way to go. Paper of record and all.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.463
The president feels
a more effective use of time

10:30.547 --> 10:32.966
- might be in weekly press conferences.
- Weekly?

10:33.049 --> 10:35.593
- Mm-hm.
- Last president to do that was Truman.

10:35.677 --> 10:39.430
Look, we've got to take advantage
of the uniqueness of this situation...

10:39.514 --> 10:42.809
Fine, but if you go out there every
week taking unfiltered questions...

10:42.892 --> 10:47.355
- Which I am more than capable of doing.
- My concern is we risk overexposure,

10:47.438 --> 10:49.899
watering down a real moment
of presidential power.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.818
Go out there every week, it's a waste.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.529
Well, with someone else, maybe.
With Mac, it's a win.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.489
People appreciate candor.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.199
Now that's what they got last week,

10:58.283 --> 11:01.494
and that's what they're gonna get
every week of her presidency.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.581
All I need now is something
to be candid about.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.876
- Kelly, you'll set it up?
- Yes, ma'am.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.085
OK, great.

11:09.169 --> 11:13.339
Carlos, walk me through your
assessment of re-authorizing Head Start.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.550
- Congratulations, sir.
- Thank you, Vince.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.178
- Between us, welcome back.
- Thank you.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.889
- Jim...
- Rod.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.765
[Kelly] OK, thanks. Bye.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.852
I just talked to the nets about
these weekly press conferences.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.979
No one's committing yet,
at least not live.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.690
- Not surprised. Lot of air time.
- They'll come around.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.734
Mac at the podium
will be a ratings spike.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.152
From your lips.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.030
Uh, Jim, listen, I know that this
must be kind of awkward...

11:37.113 --> 11:40.366
I just want to make sure that
our chain of command here is clear.

11:40.450 --> 11:43.703
If you worried less about your own turf
and more about what's right

11:43.786 --> 11:46.331
- for the president...
- I learned a long time ago,

11:46.414 --> 11:48.541
never cross anyone
who sleeps with the boss.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.545
Jim, I'm focused
on her new agenda here.

11:52.629 --> 11:56.633
You have a White House to run.
Run it. We'll get along just fine.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.135
You know where my office is.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.641
And get me a copy
of last night's Nightline.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.018
- I missed the segment on South Africa.
- Mm-hm.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.395
- Ma'am, sorry to interrupt.
- [Mac] Hey, Kelly.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.564
I have some friends...
friends of my parents

12:11.648 --> 12:13.900
are in town and asked
for a tour of the White House.

12:13.983 --> 12:18.529
- I'd be happy to meet them.
- Oh, thanks, they'd like that, but...

12:19.489 --> 12:22.158
Vince, give us a second?

12:22.242 --> 12:23.910
Of course.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.667
They brought this with them.
They thought you should see it.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.045
In the '60s, the woman's father
was a political fundraiser in Florida.

12:34.128 --> 12:37.215
He died a couple of months ago.
They were cleaning out his attic,

12:37.298 --> 12:40.468
they found these 16mm films
they had transferred to tape.

12:40.551 --> 12:45.181
This one has footage of Nathan Templeton
at a private fundraiser in 1965.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.810
You may want senior staff to see this.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.902
[Templeton] They're trying
to make segregation a dirty word.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.280
But segregation is the word of God.

13:00.363 --> 13:04.284
If the Lord Almighty wanted
colored people to mix with whites,

13:04.367 --> 13:07.412
to live with whites, to marry whites,

13:07.495 --> 13:10.123
He wouldn't have placed them
on separate continents.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.459
Nine men in Washington
can't change natural law.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.129
They can't change God's truth.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.549
I say black robes
are worse than white robes.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.302
[laughter]

13:28.224 --> 13:29.892
Oh, my God.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.898
Don't try to excuse him, Mac.
We can use this.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.443
Templeton was a kid.
Kids say stupid things.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.778
That wasn't stupid.
That was racist.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.405
I may not agree with his politics,

13:42.488 --> 13:45.158
but I have never heard a racist word
come out of his mouth.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.869
Honey, you just did.
Now we can shut him down.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.620
That's not who he is now.

13:49.704 --> 13:51.914
[sighs] Stop turning
the other cheek, Mac.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.709
I'm not gonna destroy a man's life
over something he said

13:54.792 --> 13:57.462
nearly half a century ago,
no matter how hateful it is.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.465
Look, if he had this on you,
he wouldn't hesitate to use it.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.425
I won't make Templeton
my role model.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.428
- He's a politician.
- I'm not gonna turn into that.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.932
[laughs] You're hopeless.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.606
I'm the president of the United States.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.818
- Do we still have that date tonight?
- We'd better.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.163
[police siren]

14:36.376 --> 14:38.211
Did we have to meet
in a parking garage?

14:38.294 --> 14:41.464
I know. Very Deep Throat, isn't it?

14:43.132 --> 14:45.802
There's a guy on your staff. Vince?

14:45.885 --> 14:47.428
Taylor. Yeah.

14:47.512 --> 14:48.888
Templeton knows about him.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.557
His... status.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.061
He's gonna out him.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.439
[sighs] He's a kid.
I mean, for God's sake,

14:58.523 --> 15:01.067
he's the guy that holds
the president's coat.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.320
- Why ruin his life?
- To chip away at her.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.863
Keep her on her heels.

15:05.947 --> 15:09.659
- And you're telling me this why?
- He doesn't own me, Jim.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.786
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I respect the man,

15:11.869 --> 15:15.081
but sometimes he goes farther
than even I'm comfortable with.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.764
[school bell rings]

15:41.190 --> 15:43.818
- Horace, stay with me.
- Uh, I can't, Mrs. Burke.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.404
- I'll be late for swim practice.
- Then you'll be late.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.448
Then I should tell the Secret Service.

15:48.531 --> 15:50.408
They'll figure it out. Sit down.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.872
You cheated on your essay, Horace.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.332
Mr. Cummisky said
you bought it online.

15:58.416 --> 16:02.128
- I wouldn't even know how to do that.
- I'm the assistant principal, Horace.

16:02.211 --> 16:05.798
I only sub in English once in a while.
Even I've read that same essay 30 times.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.176
I guess there aren't
a lot of new things to say.

16:08.259 --> 16:12.180
Word for word.
ExcellentEssay.com.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.389
C'mon, Mrs. Burke,

16:13.473 --> 16:16.559
like I can borrow the president's
credit card and order an essay?

16:16.642 --> 16:20.188
Wow, you really had to stretch to
work your mom into this discussion.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.024
- I wouldn't be sittin' here.
- Explain.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.902
OK. No offense, but I kinda feel
like you wanna prove

16:25.985 --> 16:27.487
you're not doing me any favors.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.655
So in your world view
I decided to pick on you

16:29.739 --> 16:31.824
because you live in
the White House, right?

16:31.908 --> 16:34.452
Your mom is the most
important woman in the world?

16:34.535 --> 16:36.162
That's a hell of a way to get ahead.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.832
Puts me on the fast track for principal.
Are you kidding?

16:40.500 --> 16:44.504
Don't play the blame game, Horace.
You plagiarized an essay.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.631
Maybe I forgot a couple of footnotes.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.342
Mr. Cummisky's giving you
an F on this assignment.

16:49.425 --> 16:53.346
If you rewrite it in your own words, I
won't report you to the Honor Committee,

16:53.429 --> 16:55.890
and that's out of respect
for the president.

16:55.973 --> 17:00.311
Also known as the only favor
I'm ever going to do for you.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.357
- Can I go now?
- Get out of here.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.866
[hip-hop music playing]

17:15.076 --> 17:17.537
[whistle blowing]

17:27.128 --> 17:28.923
- [gasping]
- Relax, turbo.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.676
Coach is still in the bathroom.
You didn't miss anything.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.390
What's up with him?

17:37.473 --> 17:39.267
Don't let Flemming bug you, man.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.686
OK. Why?

17:44.689 --> 17:46.023
About your sister.

17:47.108 --> 17:50.319
Did he say something?
What'd he say?

17:50.403 --> 17:53.406
That him and her, you knowâ€¦

17:53.489 --> 17:56.492
...had sex.
Big deal. Who cares?

17:57.493 --> 17:58.494
Dude, don't.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.871
- Hey, Flemming!
- Horace!

18:00.955 --> 18:03.749
- Horace, stop!
- Flemming, I want to talk to you.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.088
Hey, Mike!

18:09.171 --> 18:10.423
Horace!

18:13.050 --> 18:14.510
We don't have a problem, man.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.180
Look, if you're pissed off about the
other night, go kick your sister's ass.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.267
It was her idea. She picked me
for the honor. End of story.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.729
- This is a bad plan, Horace. Come down.
- Was I supposed to send her home?

18:24.812 --> 18:27.023
- I like her.
- Why don't you keep your mouth shut?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.649
- How hard is that?
- Dude, I tried.

18:28.733 --> 18:32.903
But, you know, sometimes
guys just gotta share.

18:32.987 --> 18:36.032
I mean, damn,
she's the president's daughter.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.285
I did the president's daughter!

18:43.706 --> 18:45.625
Let's go, Horace.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.096
[grunts]

19:05.770 --> 19:08.022
Now is not the time for us
to talk about the tape.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.399
No, ma'am. A different subject.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.030
At ease, Jim. You're making me
nervous. Sit down.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.532
A staff issue has come up.

19:18.616 --> 19:20.868
You're the chief of staff.
Can you handle it?

19:20.951 --> 19:24.038
Vince wasn't entirely honest
on his security app, ma'am.

19:25.456 --> 19:26.707
OK, I'm listening.

19:26.791 --> 19:29.418
- He's HIV-positive.
- What?

19:30.211 --> 19:32.213
Since when? Is he OK?

19:32.296 --> 19:35.383
He's fine. He's been taking
antiretrovirals for almost ten years.

19:35.466 --> 19:38.427
- Are you certain?
- One hundred percent. There's more.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.554
You mean his orientation?

19:40.638 --> 19:43.140
Don't you think his private life
is his own business?

19:43.224 --> 19:45.601
Not anymore. Templeton knows.

19:47.770 --> 19:50.064
How? From us? A leak?

19:50.147 --> 19:52.108
No. He's got his own outside sources.

19:53.484 --> 19:56.445
He's gonna try to embarrass you,
Madam President.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.534
Now is it time to talk about the tape?

20:10.126 --> 20:12.294
But why didn't you tell me
yourself, Vince?

20:12.378 --> 20:14.213
I wanted the job.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.966
Would you have hired me
if you knew I had HIV?

20:17.967 --> 20:20.302
You would have hired somebody
nice and healthy,

20:20.386 --> 20:23.264
who wasn't gonna embarrass you,
who wasn't gonna die on you.

20:23.347 --> 20:27.268
I heard about your roaches,
your rusty pipes, your parking tickets.

20:27.351 --> 20:31.147
But you couldn't trust me
to tell me something really important.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.357
Well, the roaches were the center
of my world.

20:33.441 --> 20:36.652
Don't dance with me, Vince.
A lie of omission is still a lie.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.071
There's a right to privacy, ma'am.

20:39.155 --> 20:42.825
I'm not required to reveal
my medical history or my...

20:43.743 --> 20:45.870
My personal choices.

20:46.662 --> 20:51.542
Gay is a little, three-letter word,
Vince. You can't even say it?

20:51.625 --> 20:53.961
I am not particularly
comfortable with labels.

20:54.044 --> 20:57.214
- Like "security risk"?
- I would never allow that to happen.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.258
I'd resign first.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.885
I accept.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.890
I'm sorry, Vince.

21:08.851 --> 21:11.645
No. I understand.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.901
The last thing I need right now
is public embarrassment.

21:19.195 --> 21:21.697
It has been an honor
to serve you, ma'am.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.922
Don't ever call yourself
anyone's friend.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.423
I confided in you.

21:39.507 --> 21:41.509
- I didn't have a choice.
- Oh, please.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.427
People say that, but it's never true.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.929
You're not a private citizen.

21:45.012 --> 21:48.224
You are the special assistant
to the president of the United States.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.768
You're gay, you're infected,
you're news.

21:50.851 --> 21:53.312
Nathan Templeton plans
to drag you out of the closet

21:53.395 --> 21:56.315
and use the omission on your security
app to burn the president.

21:56.398 --> 21:59.652
I didn't work on policy, Jim.
I'm a nobody, an ex-nobody.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.905
You've spent more time with
the president than anyone else has.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.032
You're important to her.
She relied on you.

22:05.115 --> 22:09.036
That put you in his cross hairs,
you and everybody else on her team.

22:09.119 --> 22:11.455
Now he wants to hurt her
any way he can.

22:15.042 --> 22:17.044
You'd better call your parents, Vince.

- Sorry. What's up?

22:40.276 --> 22:43.279
- How's school?
- It's OK.

22:44.405 --> 22:47.199
Why do you guys always make that
sound like a trick question?

22:47.283 --> 22:49.869
It's just a question, Horace.
Same old question.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.538
You might as well stop asking.
If there was something

22:52.621 --> 22:55.583
I want to tell you about,
I would just straight-out tell you.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.543
- When?
- What?

22:57.626 --> 22:58.794
When would you tell us?

22:59.962 --> 23:03.507
For instance, when were you gonna
tell us about that F you got in English?

23:03.591 --> 23:06.969
- I can't believe she called you.
- You've gotten away with so much crap.

23:07.052 --> 23:10.097
You think you can always yak
your way out of trouble?

23:10.180 --> 23:11.974
Don't be proud of that!

23:13.017 --> 23:15.644
- You wanna hear my side?
- You have no side, Horace.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.856
You cheated. You lied.
There's no defense.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.567
I'd rather have you fail a class
than con your way into an A.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.611
Oh, my God, you're such a hypocrite!

23:23.694 --> 23:25.404
You and Mom are always on my case...

Oh, come on! You're coasting!

I'm not as smart as you think I am.
Becca's the brain.

23:32.703 --> 23:35.623
No. The only difference is that
she is busy, and you're lazy.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.374
Oh, yeah, she's just perfect.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.794
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's not exactly a secret.

23:40.878 --> 23:43.172
The whole grade's heard
about her and Mike.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.090

I accepted it.

24:22.628 --> 24:27.007
That... that does not mean
I'm homophobic or discriminatory.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.093
I... I resent the suggestion.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.303
I'm only talking
about perceptions, ma'am.

With all due respect,
then you're in the wrong town, ma'am.

Never turn your back on a bear.

Mmm. I think I know
what that means.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.659
Getting rid of Vince
won't stop Templeton.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.202
It'll only make things worse.

24:55.285 --> 24:58.330
It'll prove the accusation,
and you lose your best aide.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.833
You want me to refuse
his resignation.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.002
He's still cleaning out his office.

25:05.087 --> 25:08.090
I like your loyalty.
You make a good friend.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.552
I hope that you're one of mine.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.195
[Kelly] Madam President,

25:30.279 --> 25:32.489
- I spoke with the Dubidouxs...
- Dubidouxs?

25:32.573 --> 25:35.034
Rubie and Frank,
my parents' friends with the tape.

25:35.117 --> 25:37.036
There's someone named
Rubie Dubidoux?

25:37.119 --> 25:39.163
- It's French. This is the original.
- Wow.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.331
Almost ready for you
in the Roosevelt Room.

25:41.415 --> 25:44.376
- I don't have anything.
- Photo op. Doctors Without Borders.

25:44.460 --> 25:47.546
That's the old schedule.
It's changed three times since then.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.841
We'll be 15 late to the photo op.
Have Jim join us in the Oval.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.093
I want to keep him in the loop
on the Dubidouxs.

25:53.177 --> 25:55.220
- Dubidouxs?
- It's French.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.266
You're sure they don't have
any copies of this?

25:59.349 --> 26:01.769
- I trust them.
- Trust them not to talk to the press?

26:01.852 --> 26:05.105
- They could use a little convincing.
- [Rod] What kind of convincing?

26:05.189 --> 26:07.524
They have a daughter.
She's a high school senior.

26:07.608 --> 26:10.069
Not the greatest student
but a really good kid.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.361
You've gotta be joking.

26:11.445 --> 26:14.448
- Help get her into college.
- Any Ivy League school.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.575
- Harvard. Yale. Brown.
- How original.

26:16.658 --> 26:20.579
So I do this, you're sure they're
gonna stay away from the press?

26:20.662 --> 26:23.499
I think they'd be grateful
the rest of their lives.

26:27.503 --> 26:28.837
- [woman] Yes, ma'am.
- Hey.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.548
Can you please get me
Leonard Billings on the line?

26:31.632 --> 26:32.841
Right away, ma'am.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.933
[door opens]

26:41.016 --> 26:42.351
Vince.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.521
Madam President.
Is something wrong?

26:46.688 --> 26:48.899
Well, Kelly, Jim and Rod

26:48.982 --> 26:51.819
have all been working off
different schedules all day.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.112
Nan'll get up to speed.

26:53.195 --> 26:55.823
I don't have time to get
someone else up to speed.

26:55.906 --> 26:59.034
If you want, I would like you to stay.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.665
Of course I want.

27:05.666 --> 27:06.959
I don't know what to say.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.503
Say that you'll be more honest
with me in the future.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.881
- I cannot abide being kept in the dark.
- Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.759
Keeping a secret like this
puts the administration at risk.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.053
I felt it was a private thing.

27:18.137 --> 27:22.724
Hard to have a private life when you
answer to over 295 million employers.

27:23.267 --> 27:26.562
- Madam President, the speaker's here.
- Be right there.

27:27.354 --> 27:30.023
It's the White House, Vince.
Think about it.

27:37.906 --> 27:41.285
Mr. Speaker. Thank you
for coming on short notice.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.579
Oh, always available for my president.

27:44.955 --> 27:46.623
To what do I owe the pleasure?

27:46.707 --> 27:48.959
Well, a little office politics.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.753
Um, I heard a rumor

27:51.837 --> 27:55.757
that someone plans to leak a story
on my special assistant, Vince Taylor.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.261
Ah, that he's HIV-positive.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.680
- Sad.
- Yeah.

28:01.763 --> 28:03.849
His health is fine, thank you.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.226
But this is a private matter for him,

28:06.310 --> 28:09.354
and I would hate for it
to become public.

28:09.438 --> 28:13.066
And you don't want any more bad press
about your staffing situation, do you?

28:13.150 --> 28:15.569
- I understand that.
- Right. I'm sure you do.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.573
Um, I also hear rumors that
this information was obtained

28:19.656 --> 28:21.867
by an insurance lobbyist

28:21.950 --> 28:24.786
illegally accessing
private medical records.

28:24.870 --> 28:27.664
Well, the way I hear it,
when he was younger,

28:27.748 --> 28:30.834
his parents took out
a restraining order on his gay lover.

28:30.918 --> 28:34.129
I mean, anyone can dig that up,
follow the clues.

28:35.881 --> 28:38.467
People make mistakes
when they're young.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.887
But if they go into politics,

28:41.970 --> 28:44.640
those mistakes can come back
to haunt them.

28:45.474 --> 28:49.228
You know what they say,
"It's a contact sport. Wear a cup."

28:49.311 --> 28:52.356
I don't know, whatever you'd wear.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.650
[stammers] Chest protector, whatever.

28:57.778 --> 29:00.489
You may want to put on a cup for this.

29:02.699 --> 29:03.700
[clicks TV on]

29:03.784 --> 29:07.704
[Templeton] They're trying
to make segregation a dirty word.

29:07.788 --> 29:10.082
But segregation is the word of God.

29:10.165 --> 29:14.419
If the Lord Almighty wanted
colored people to mix with whites,

29:14.503 --> 29:16.964
to live with whites, to marry whites,

29:17.047 --> 29:19.549
He wouldn't have placed them
on separate continents.

29:19.633 --> 29:22.761
- Nine men in Washington...
- Turn it off! Turn it off!

29:23.887 --> 29:25.639
[TV turns off]

29:30.852 --> 29:35.857
If it was your intention
to humiliate me...

29:36.817 --> 29:38.485
...you have succeeded.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.741
I don't believe that tape
represents who you are today.

29:44.825 --> 29:47.536
It doesn't represent who I ever was.

29:49.371 --> 29:52.874
I was a young Southern Democrat

29:52.958 --> 29:56.837
saying whatever I had
to say to get elected.

29:59.256 --> 30:03.093
I think that my voting record
since those days

30:03.176 --> 30:04.845
speaks for itself.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.766
But if that were to get out,

30:09.850 --> 30:12.144
it would represent who I am.

30:12.227 --> 30:15.689
It would... be who I am.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.400
But you know that.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.486
It doesn't have to get out.

30:24.906 --> 30:30.287
Nor does the information
about your special assistant.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.955
[laughs]

30:32.039 --> 30:36.793
In the old days we used to call this
mutual assured destruction.

30:36.877 --> 30:39.880
Mmm. If memory serves,

30:39.963 --> 30:42.507
you were a big proponent
of that policy.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.593
McNamara's policy, as it was.

30:44.676 --> 30:48.722
You know this tape could cause
a hell of a lot more damage to me

30:48.805 --> 30:51.433
than a staffing scandal
could cause to you.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.685
Why hold it back?

30:53.769 --> 30:57.147
Maybe I think the country
doesn't need another scandal right now.

30:57.230 --> 31:01.276
Maybe you want to have something
to hold over my head.

31:02.444 --> 31:04.029
Mr. Speaker,

31:04.112 --> 31:07.866
after all that we've been
through now,

31:07.949 --> 31:11.119
I was hoping we could put aside
some of our differences,

31:11.203 --> 31:12.788
become friends.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.206
[chuckles]

31:14.289 --> 31:17.125
This is Washington, D.C.,
Madam President.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.252
There are no friends here.

31:19.336 --> 31:24.174
There are only enemies... and allies.

31:29.471 --> 31:32.933
This will not put me in your pocket.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.271
But...

31:39.856 --> 31:42.234
...it will put me in your debt.

31:42.317 --> 31:45.070
- [door opens]
- I'll call it in sometime.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.408
I don't doubt it.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.661
[door closing]

31:56.873 --> 32:00.085
So I was thinking if the president
was willing to put out a statement

32:00.168 --> 32:03.088
about her administration's
HIV/AIDS policy,

32:03.171 --> 32:05.799
maybe we could slip something
in there about my status,

32:05.882 --> 32:07.259
not make it a big thing.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.344
If you're going public, do it right.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.347
Don't... don't try to sneak
the announcement past people.

32:12.431 --> 32:15.350
People hear you have HIV,
and they think you're weak, sick.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.561
I don't want anyone
to think that about me.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.272
They'll only think that if you quit.

32:23.900 --> 32:28.238
I never told anyone about my HIV
because I was afraid.

32:30.115 --> 32:33.285
Maybe if I make this public,

32:33.368 --> 32:35.036
keep working here,

32:35.996 --> 32:40.000
maybe it helps someone
somewhere feel less afraid.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.879
Maybe that's how
I can make a difference.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.383
There's your statement right there.

32:49.593 --> 32:52.137
[reporters clamoring]

32:52.220 --> 32:54.639
Does the presence
of an HIV-positive staff member

32:54.723 --> 32:57.893
working in close proximity
pose any threat to the president?

32:57.976 --> 33:00.145
The White House physician,
the Secret Service

33:00.228 --> 33:02.314
and common sense
tell me there's no problem.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.065
[reporters clamoring]

33:04.149 --> 33:07.944
A recent study indicates the AIDS virus
thins out parts of the human brain,

33:08.028 --> 33:10.197
even in patients
who are otherwise healthy.

33:10.280 --> 33:13.241
The study you're referring to
dealt with 26 HIV patients...

33:15.076 --> 33:17.078
- Madam President.
- I'll answer that.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.832
The president of the United States.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.835
Thank you, Kelly. Please.

33:25.754 --> 33:29.090
Regarding Vince Taylor,
his hair may be thinning,

33:29.174 --> 33:31.676
but I assure you,
his brain is in great shape.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.261
[reporters laughing]

33:33.345 --> 33:35.305
[Mac] We're lucky to have him.

33:35.388 --> 33:39.976
HIV is an issue that affects
40 million people around the world,

33:40.060 --> 33:42.437
along with their friends and family.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.899
Vince has courageously made
his condition public

33:45.982 --> 33:48.193
and by doing so helps to make it clear

33:48.276 --> 33:50.445
that people living with HIV

33:50.529 --> 33:53.448
can be as vital and productive
as anyone.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.784
- [reporters clamoring]
- Uh, you know,

33:55.867 --> 33:58.995
as much as I appreciate Vince,

33:59.079 --> 34:00.664
I'm not here to talk about him.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.541
I have an announcement.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.461
As president,
I work for the American people,

34:06.545 --> 34:09.630
and I believe the people
deserve accountability.

34:09.714 --> 34:13.677
And so, in the tradition
of President Roosevelt,

34:13.760 --> 34:16.972
I am instituting
a weekly press conference.

34:19.266 --> 34:20.684
[reporters clamoring]

34:20.766 --> 34:24.437
Madam President, how are you
finding your first months in office?

34:24.521 --> 34:27.690
Challenging. It's, uh, exciting.

34:27.774 --> 34:30.150
My daughter would say it's awesome.

34:30.985 --> 34:32.737
And it is awesome.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.824
It has a very real sense of awe.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.494
And sometimes it's just, "Ohh!"

34:39.578 --> 34:41.746
[reporters laughing, clamoring]

34:41.830 --> 34:44.833
- [woman] Madam President!
- [man] Madam President.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.585
What do you think?

34:48.837 --> 34:50.880
I think she's digging her own grave.

34:50.964 --> 34:52.299
You do?

34:53.257 --> 34:56.594
The press will kiss up to her for
a few weeks, the novelty will wear off,

34:56.678 --> 34:59.514
then they'll use these
press conferences to tear her up.

35:00.223 --> 35:03.893
- Makes better TV.
- I'm a little sick of TV tonight.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.233
Are you OK?

35:11.401 --> 35:13.737
I mean, she just handed
herself to us on a plate.

35:16.615 --> 35:19.659
She just ambushed me
in the Oval Office.

35:19.743 --> 35:22.787
She knew I had the story
of her gay assistant,

35:22.871 --> 35:24.080
and she knew how I got it.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.544
- We'll have other opportunities...
- We?

35:30.712 --> 35:32.339
I trusted you, Jayne.

35:32.422 --> 35:36.176
Trusted you to keep my confidences.
I trusted your priorities.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.720
I gave you information
from him whenever I could.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.722
This time you gave
my information to him.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.266
- Mr. Speaker...
- I don't want to hear your excuses!

35:43.350 --> 35:46.394
Just get out of here.
I don't want to see you again.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.654
- I'll get my things.
- Not to worry. I'll have them sent.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.330
[sighs]

36:12.087 --> 36:13.755
[door opens]

36:18.259 --> 36:20.261
[Templeton] Sweetheart?

36:21.930 --> 36:23.431
Honey?

36:26.142 --> 36:27.268
You OK?

36:35.110 --> 36:36.778
You OK?

36:42.909 --> 36:44.911
[sighs]

36:46.454 --> 36:48.081
I just... I just got tired.

36:48.164 --> 36:50.208
Did you test yourself? Are you low?

36:50.291 --> 36:52.293
When did you come home?

36:55.714 --> 36:57.716
Your blood sugar's 55.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.969
We gotta get some juice
into you, OK?

37:03.722 --> 37:05.724
Here. Drink that.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.852
Come on. [chuckles]

37:11.396 --> 37:12.814
Feel better?

37:17.152 --> 37:19.320
Thank you, darling.

37:19.404 --> 37:20.739
Keep sipping.

37:21.614 --> 37:25.285
You gotta remember, better high
than low with the blood sugar, OK?

37:25.368 --> 37:27.036
Mm-hm.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.500
How was your day?

37:35.295 --> 37:37.630
[sighing]

37:41.426 --> 37:42.719
Fast-poll numbers are up.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.929
- Got positive e-mail spikes.
- People love

37:45.013 --> 37:48.475
- the press conference announcement.
- Hope it holds over the long haul.

37:48.558 --> 37:51.770
Presidents should be responsible
to the people.

37:51.853 --> 37:55.482
It kills me how we have to think about
how doing that affects our numbers.

37:55.565 --> 37:57.108
But we do.

37:59.235 --> 38:01.196
Thank you for today, Jim.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.364
Go home. It's been a long one.

38:07.660 --> 38:09.370
Once you knew Vince
was going public,

38:09.454 --> 38:11.915
why didn't you use what you had
against Templeton?

38:11.998 --> 38:16.169
"Revenge is the weak pleasure
of a narrow mind."

38:16.252 --> 38:17.337
Juvenal.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.380
We can't afford to be soft on this guy.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.548
Good night, Jim.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.428
Good night, Madam President.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.809
[chatter over TV]

38:34.979 --> 38:37.816
- [rock music playing]
- [knock on door]

38:39.359 --> 38:40.985
- Hey there.
- Hey, Mom.

38:41.069 --> 38:43.029
- Good press conference.
- You think?

38:43.112 --> 38:45.782
Yeah. Except I don't say "awesome."

38:45.865 --> 38:46.950
What do you mean?

38:47.033 --> 38:50.286
"My daughter would say
being president's awesome."

38:50.370 --> 38:51.496
I meant Amy.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.749
- Oh, well, everyone's gonna ask.
- Sorry.

38:55.625 --> 38:58.002
I know I'm really busy.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.213
This is an important time
in your life,

39:00.296 --> 39:02.841
and I want to be here for you.

39:02.924 --> 39:06.135
You are here for me, Mom.
You're in my room.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.932
I know there are some rumors
floating around your school.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.685
- Look, Mom, they're just rumors.
- OK.

39:14.435 --> 39:17.438
I just want you to know I'm...

39:18.064 --> 39:19.732
I'm not a prude.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.901
I wasn't a virgin when I got married.

39:21.985 --> 39:24.028
Mom.

39:24.112 --> 39:25.321
Look,

39:25.405 --> 39:28.157
I didn't do anything, OK?

39:28.241 --> 39:30.118
Nothing happened with that guy.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.537
He just...

39:32.620 --> 39:34.581
He just turned out to be a total jerk

39:34.664 --> 39:37.125
who's telling lies
about me to everyone.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.044
And please don't tell me
it doesn't matter what people say,

39:40.128 --> 39:42.839
because... because it does.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.883
It does, I know.
I know it matters, baby.

39:44.966 --> 39:47.218
People say things, and it hurts.

39:47.302 --> 39:50.972
Part of growing up
is learning to deal with that

39:51.055 --> 39:54.058
and still do the right thing,
which it seems like you are.

39:54.142 --> 39:55.643
I'm really proud of that.

39:58.021 --> 40:00.732
- Doesn't stop it from sucking.
- Yeah.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.359
Do you want me to talk
to the boy's parents?

40:03.443 --> 40:05.904
Oh, no, Mom.
That would just make it worse.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.947
OK. [chuckles]

40:08.031 --> 40:10.700
Do you want me to have him
arrested under the Patriot Act

40:10.783 --> 40:13.369
- and ship him off to prison in Syria?
- That sounds good.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.163
I'll get into it in the morning.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.540
- All right.
- Go to bed.

40:17.624 --> 40:19.959
- 'Night, Mom.
- 'Night, baby.

40:24.172 --> 40:26.090
I got the memo from Scheduling.

40:26.174 --> 40:28.843
So you're giving the commencement
address at Brown, huh?

40:28.927 --> 40:30.762
Everything comes at a cost,

40:30.845 --> 40:34.432
but Rubie Dubidoux's daughter
is Brown-bound.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.267
With a major in alliteration.

40:36.351 --> 40:38.436
- [laughing]
- [Mac groans]

40:38.519 --> 40:40.313
I'm so wiped. Are you?

40:40.396 --> 40:43.399
Yeah, but... kind of energized.

40:44.525 --> 40:47.070
- I really like my job.
- Mmm.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.617
Mmm, you are energized. I like that.

40:57.163 --> 40:58.915
- [door opens]
- [Amy] Mommy?

41:01.042 --> 41:03.461
Baby? Potus interruptus.

41:04.712 --> 41:07.215
- I had a bad dream.
- You want some warm milk?

41:07.298 --> 41:10.385
- Yes, please.
- OK. I'll go get it.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.096
[Rod] No, I'll get it.
Let me get it.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.723
Wake me when you get back.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.768
Sleep. You have a country to run.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.730
Come on.

41:23.564 --> 41:24.899
Come on.

41:30.446 --> 41:32.365
Mmm.
