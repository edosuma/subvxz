WEBVTT

00:07.425 --> 00:11.384
We remember you now.
And we need you back.

00:11.596 --> 00:16.181
So please, my
darling Granddaughter...

00:16.392 --> 00:20.761
just tell us, where are you?

00:37.121 --> 00:38.782
Tamsin, what are you doing?

00:38.998 --> 00:40.784
We all gotta die some day.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.456
Stop the car.

00:43.294 --> 00:44.409
Tamsin!

00:45.880 --> 00:47.245
Nnnnoooo!

01:03.606 --> 01:05.722
Someone's in
there, come on out.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.692
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.485
Ow.

01:15.493 --> 01:19.361
I'm still not gonna
hurt you... much.

01:21.666 --> 01:24.373
Take it easy,. Take it easy.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.826
Shh. Hey, I'm
not gonna hurt you.

01:30.258 --> 01:32.874
Life is hard when you
don ’t know who you are.

01:33.094 --> 01:35.801
It’s harder when you
don ’t know what you are.

01:36.013 --> 01:38.755
My love carries
a death sentence.

01:38.975 --> 01:44.015
I was lost for years,
searching while hiding.

01:44.230 --> 01:48.018
Only to find I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

01:48.234 --> 01:49.690
I won 't hide anymore.

01:49.902 --> 01:52.769
I will live
the life I choose.

01:59.245 --> 02:01.452
You got champagne, chocolate;

02:01.664 --> 02:05.532
both lube and
actual chocolate.

02:05.751 --> 02:09.369
And I got a lead on
some Victoria Secret models.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.546
And I'm not talking
catalogue, hon.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.754
l'm takinI runway.

02:15.970 --> 02:18.757
Angel quality.

02:18.973 --> 02:20.554
Kenz.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.970
What are you doing?

02:23.185 --> 02:26.052
Ta da! I got
her favourite stuff.

02:26.272 --> 02:29.764
I got uh... I got silk
rope, blindfolds, corndogs.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.520
We haven't found her yet.

02:31.736 --> 02:34.523
Well, just a matter
of time. You know that.

02:35.406 --> 02:37.271
What about, uh,
Taft's observatory?

02:37.491 --> 02:40.198
There's nothin'. No scent.
It's completely gone.

02:40.411 --> 02:41.400
Trick? Hale?

02:41.620 --> 02:43.235
Hale is monitoring
her cards and phone

02:43.456 --> 02:44.741
and Trick's got feelers
in the underground,

02:44.957 --> 02:46.538
but so far nothing.

02:46.751 --> 02:49.709
Well it's not like she just
disappeared into nothing, right?

02:49.920 --> 02:53.788
I'm sure she's just super
pumped from super-sucking

02:54.008 --> 02:56.545
to death whatever
ass-fart took her.

02:56.761 --> 02:58.046
You're probably right.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.843
'Course lam.

03:02.141 --> 03:03.972
'Course lam.

03:06.354 --> 03:09.346
D, please tell
me we have a lead.

03:09.565 --> 03:12.181
Why don't you
come downstairs.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.102
Oh my god, it's mini-me.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.028
Who is that?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.366
I found her at the site.

03:19.575 --> 03:20.906
You think she saw the crash?

03:21.118 --> 03:22.983
I think she was in the crash.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.661
You've got to be shitting me.

03:25.873 --> 03:28.364
Valkyries have many lives.

03:28.584 --> 03:32.202
|just... I dunno, figured
she'd be more like clone-y.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.332
Tamsin was the
last person to see Bo.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.039
And in the truck, she said
something about Bo's father.

03:37.259 --> 03:39.045
Bo doesn't even know
anything about Bo's father.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.001
Well maybe she does.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.258
Okay, well then we got to
go all interrogation on her.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.055
Find out who she is for real.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.053
We don't wanna frighten
her. She might lash out.

03:47.269 --> 03:49.646
And if she is Tamsin,
she did try to kill you.

03:49.855 --> 03:50.139
There is that.

03:50.356 --> 03:50.970
Yeah.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.976
But she might not be Tamsin.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.808
Peace out, losers.
lmma go play.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.146
Later.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.446
lt's Tamsin.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.213
Oh, dammit.

04:19.635 --> 04:20.875
(gasp) Oh.

04:21.929 --> 04:22.554
You okay?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.970
Yeah.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.173
If you ever need anything.

04:27.393 --> 04:30.351
Thanks. I don't.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.730
So she can't give
us any information.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.026
When Valkyries are reborn,

04:40.239 --> 04:41.979
their memories come
back slow and scattered.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.611
And apparently their
hair full and lustrous.

04:44.827 --> 04:47.569
At this age they're
vulnerable and valuable.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.904
But her memories, Trick, they
will come back eventually right?

04:50.124 --> 04:52.160
Valkyries deal in
the souls of the dead.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.287
They see so much
carnage in one lifetime

04:54.503 --> 04:58.371
that sometimes they repress
those memories in the next.

04:58.591 --> 04:59.501
Shit.

04:59.717 --> 05:00.581
Language.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.587
Again.

05:02.803 --> 05:07.513
But yes, c'est tres poopy, she
was the last one who saw Bo.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.257
This place is a death trap.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.514
Remind me to embroider
that on a pillow.

05:12.730 --> 05:13.970
Again.

05:14.190 --> 05:16.021
I've seen duck ponds
with better security.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.189
How are you still alive?

05:21.655 --> 05:25.022
Trick. ls Tamsin really our
last chance of finding Bo?

05:25.242 --> 05:26.652
There is one other way.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.825
What happened to your arm?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.450
We need a certain
directional device.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.373
The compass you left
behind at Engelram's.

05:35.586 --> 05:36.496
Oh...

05:37.505 --> 05:39.041
This bad boy?

05:41.759 --> 05:43.624
Kenzi. You little thief.

05:43.844 --> 05:44.924
Again.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.752
Have either of you
seen my Armillary Sphere?

05:46.972 --> 05:48.758
Okay, well while you
guys are working on that,

05:48.974 --> 05:52.432
I'm gonna go
do a couple things.

05:53.646 --> 05:55.386
You are not going anywhere.

05:55.606 --> 05:57.517
This, does not babysit.

05:57.733 --> 05:58.438
Again.

05:58.651 --> 05:59.606
Could have fooled me.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.683
It's about yay big.
Encrusted in rubies?

06:01.904 --> 06:03.019
Hard to miss.

06:03.239 --> 06:04.524
Okay, I'm just merely
educating the child

06:04.740 --> 06:06.651
in the ways of
internet hilarity.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.823
Watching an animated bear
dance to "Gangnam Style"

06:09.036 --> 06:10.492
is just a basic
life necessity. So--

06:10.704 --> 06:13.821
Well you can continue educating
her in the basic necessities

06:14.041 --> 06:16.498
and keep her safe.
Hale and I will find Bo.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.870
Hells no.

06:18.087 --> 06:18.496
Language.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.794
Again.

06:22.174 --> 06:22.924
Dyson .

06:23.133 --> 06:25.169
Kenzi. This is
not a discussion.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.250
You have to let me go.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.710
Kenzi, you're not going out there.

06:27.930 --> 06:28.715
Again, again, again, again!

06:28.931 --> 06:30.546
Quiet!

06:32.309 --> 06:33.640
Do you know where Bo is?

06:33.852 --> 06:35.888
I know where she's not.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.185
Because according
to this compass

06:37.398 --> 06:40.014
she's no longer on
this physical plane.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.816
Again.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.322
Hello?

06:57.001 --> 07:00.960
Oh... Everything's spinning.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.668
Not spinning, moving.

07:06.719 --> 07:08.255
Moving?

07:14.935 --> 07:18.553
Oh... shit.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.444
Trick, are you gonna tell
me what really happened?

07:34.663 --> 07:37.405
I can smell
Aife's blood on you.

07:37.625 --> 07:41.209
She was wounded... at my hand.

07:42.504 --> 07:46.372
When the spell was broken and
we remembered Bo, there was joy.

07:46.592 --> 07:50.005
But for Aife there was only
the memory of losing her child.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.632
And she was driven
back to insanity.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.722
I'm sorry.

07:55.934 --> 07:59.062
Bo must never find out.

07:59.271 --> 08:02.229
There's a lot of things
Bo must never find out.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.978
So, trackers.
Helios is retired.

08:05.194 --> 08:08.527
Moldavia's in prison. There's
Ebisu, but he's an idiot.

08:08.739 --> 08:12.197
No. There's only
one person who can

08:12.409 --> 08:16.448
transverse the intersecting
planes of existence.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.989
Endymion? He's legendary.

08:20.209 --> 08:23.747
And, for the last eight
hundred years, elusive.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.874
There's only one Fae who might
be able to tell us where he is.

08:27.091 --> 08:28.877
Selene.

08:29.093 --> 08:32.301
His ex. She owns a salon.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.260
The Una Mens.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.718
I thought they set up
base in the Ash's compound.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.179
They're pulling in
people for "interviews."

08:43.399 --> 08:45.355
Restoring order
is a messy business.

08:45.567 --> 08:51.528
Torture, death,
man-hunts, pain. The usze.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.542
Is this what pain looks like?

09:09.758 --> 09:12.966
No, this is a spa
weekend in St. Lucia.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.759
Look, please, no more!

09:14.972 --> 09:17.839
Tell us what you have
done with The Morrigan's body.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.550
She was behind the
portrait above my desk.

09:21.770 --> 09:26.184
But she escaped. That wicked
wench is toying with me.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.732
She's not dead. She's missing.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.902
She is dead. She is missing.

09:32.114 --> 09:34.605
One of those
things is a lie. Or both.

09:34.825 --> 09:38.784
That evil little tart
is very irritatingly alive.

09:38.996 --> 09:41.408
I swear on the
graves of my family.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.535
It was our mistake to not
count you amongst those graves.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.619
This life gives too much
power to the last Mesmer.

09:47.838 --> 09:49.874
You are but waste.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.545
Please. Please no!

09:53.761 --> 09:58.801
No, please,
please! No, no wait!

09:59.016 --> 10:00.426
I'll give you what you want.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.382
Interested.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.683
Not Evony.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.011
Not interested.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.814
Something
infinitely more valuable.

10:09.777 --> 10:13.395
Why would I give
you a crazy bitch,

10:13.614 --> 10:16.276
when I could give you her.

10:21.747 --> 10:24.830
Accepted. You are released.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.374
With one minor adjustment.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.221
Aaaahhhhh!

10:46.104 --> 10:49.096
Welcome to Selene's, gentlemen.
What can I help you with?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.602
Mani-pedi? Chest wax?

10:51.819 --> 10:53.229
Polish your badges?

10:53.445 --> 10:54.605
We're looking for someone.

10:54.822 --> 10:55.982
Aren't we all, darling.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.359
A blast from
the past. Endymion.

10:58.575 --> 11:02.363
Eddy? Oh my Rod Stewart,
it's been years.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.695
If you know where he is, we
need to find him immediately.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.906
Pleasure before business.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.831
Something tells
me those unruly curls

11:09.044 --> 11:12.582
aren't going to
manage themselves.

11:23.892 --> 11:27.180
We don't usually let customers
make their own appointments.

11:27.396 --> 11:28.602
Actually I was just--

11:28.814 --> 11:31.351
You were looking for Eddy.
What do you want with him?

11:31.567 --> 11:33.023
|t's police business.

11:33.235 --> 11:36.693
You know Selene's gonna
string you along for a kick,

11:36.905 --> 11:38.691
but she's not
gonna tell you shit.

11:38.907 --> 11:44.652
So what you need to
do is go and see Astrid.

11:44.872 --> 11:51.710
And you need to go and
give her this message.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.876
This is Hindi.

11:57.092 --> 11:59.754
Wait, look, you know
I didn't get your...

11:59.970 --> 12:01.961
name.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.349
Did you get anything?

12:12.566 --> 12:14.352
Yeah don't worry,
I got a lead.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.559
Good, all I got
was a head massage.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.148
|s Dyson your boyfriend?

12:23.368 --> 12:24.118
Nyet.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.284
Do you have a boyfriend?

12:26.496 --> 12:27.997
Negative. Men are stupid.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.491
Did you ever have a boyfriend?

12:29.708 --> 12:32.415
With this bod?
Hel... Heck yeah.

12:32.628 --> 12:34.289
Why'd you break up?

12:34.504 --> 12:35.710
|t's complicated.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.163
Didn't you love him anymore?

12:37.382 --> 12:40.840
I know, right? You think that
love is gonna be the ultimate,

12:41.053 --> 12:42.008
and then you
realize that it means

12:42.220 --> 12:43.426
giving up more than you knew.

12:43.639 --> 12:44.503
And you make this decision

12:44.723 --> 12:46.509
and it kicks you
in the friggin' box

12:46.725 --> 12:50.183
and leaves you wondering if
it's ever worth loving again.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.181
Or whatever.

12:52.898 --> 12:53.978
Who's Hale?

12:54.191 --> 12:55.226
Is he cute?

12:55.442 --> 12:58.525
He's uh, a friend.
A cop. A cop friend.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.068
What's a condom?

13:00.948 --> 13:04.736
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
You just got, you gotta--

13:04.952 --> 13:06.283
Hey.

13:08.205 --> 13:11.163
Hey, hey, hey, sharp
objects. Not for you.

13:11.375 --> 13:15.209
Look, this is
Bo's room. Bo only.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.126
I do not want you
touching her stuff.

13:17.339 --> 13:21.127
I don't even want you
looking at her stuff, okay?

13:21.843 --> 13:22.878
What are you,
what are you doing?

13:23.095 --> 13:24.960
Why are you vibrating.
Is it a Valkyrie thing?

13:25.180 --> 13:27.216
l have to pee.

13:27.432 --> 13:31.345
Oh, I don't need to, like,
be there for that, do |?

13:31.561 --> 13:33.222
No.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.554
Well okay, go on then.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.014
Thank you.

13:37.234 --> 13:37.723
Ugh.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.353
TAMSIN: Ugh.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.988
No, no, no, no, no,
what are you doing?

13:53.208 --> 13:56.450
What are you doing?! I need that
to be Fae. It's my only hope!

13:56.670 --> 13:57.750
(crying)

13:57.963 --> 14:00.875
Oh Tam-Tam honey. Honey
I'm sorry please don't cry.

14:01.091 --> 14:02.706
Please don't cry.
It's all my fault.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.292
Stupid Kenzi. |t'sjust...
it's the cream...

14:05.512 --> 14:08.424
|t's-- It's my disguise.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.598
|t's magic. |t's magic.
Do you want to see it?

14:11.810 --> 14:15.928
Okay, okay. Here.

14:18.275 --> 14:20.106
Okay.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.856
Little girls and Valkyries,

14:24.072 --> 14:30.238
I present to you, the
Russian magic of Kenzlana.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.080
(chuckle)

14:40.922 --> 14:42.503
(clapping)

14:42.716 --> 14:43.421
Again.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.090
Sorry kid. Can't do
it. No cream, no gleam.

14:46.303 --> 14:47.668
Oh...

14:47.888 --> 14:50.846
But um...
we can make cookies.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.428
No. This I cannot do.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.181
The woman who wrote that
doesn't want you to find him.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.513
She wants your
memories erased.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.349
Well there's a lot
of that goin' around.

15:03.653 --> 15:07.521
The blonde one is frustrated.
The other one too.

15:07.741 --> 15:12.280
You seek a hunter. And
you seek the courage to hunt.

15:13.497 --> 15:14.657
I don't know what
you're talking about.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.489
I don't talk. I cannot talk.

15:22.214 --> 15:25.672
An Astomi. It's a pleasure.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.920
Mine too. For one
who gets her sustenance

15:28.136 --> 15:32.425
from the scents around her,
you two are a tasty treat.

15:32.641 --> 15:34.472
Why didn't you
erase our memory?

15:34.684 --> 15:36.140
I've been
perfuming the creams

15:36.353 --> 15:38.685
and shampoos at
Selene's for years.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.513
The women who work
there are evil incarnate.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.724
Twelve years later and
the perm they gave me

15:43.944 --> 15:45.855
still hasn't grown out.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.106
Will you help us?

15:47.322 --> 15:49.654
It would be my pleasure.

15:50.617 --> 15:55.737
This is one kiss. Only one
moment will be its match.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.366
Excuse me?

15:57.582 --> 15:59.197
You will get what you need.

16:04.089 --> 16:09.880
And for your frustrations,
go to the one you love.

16:19.729 --> 16:23.517
I had several fantasies
that started just like this.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.903
You really
shouldn't've come back.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.730
You lied to me.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.949
I think it's time you
answered some questions.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.700
Girls, it's feeding time.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.372
And guess who's
coming to dinner?

16:45.088 --> 16:46.453
Whoa.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.538
So this fantasy of yours, all
the girls carrying pokey things?

16:48.758 --> 16:52.421
Nope. There was
only one pokey thing.

16:52.637 --> 16:54.093
And it was mine.

17:02.731 --> 17:03.686
What's your name?

17:03.899 --> 17:06.641
Who cares? He's snackilicious.

17:06.860 --> 17:07.940
He smells like cupcakes--

17:08.153 --> 17:09.108
And fresh laundry--

17:09.321 --> 17:10.356
And Jon Hamm.

17:10.572 --> 17:11.903
What did the Astrid do to us?

17:12.115 --> 17:13.696
Not us. You.

17:13.909 --> 17:16.776
lam hungry.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.110
Hale, |, I gotta--

17:18.330 --> 17:21.037
Yeah go find Selene, find
Eddy. Do what you got to do.

17:21.249 --> 17:22.204
I owe you one.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.373
Yeah you,
you owe me like fifty.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.253
So, if you and
Bo live together,

17:28.465 --> 17:30.126
does that mean
you love each other?

17:30.342 --> 17:32.298
Totally. But
it's strictly BFF's.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.216
Here, wanna lick?

17:34.429 --> 17:36.010
What's BFF?

17:36.223 --> 17:40.341
Well, it's when two people
would do anything for each other

17:40.560 --> 17:42.221
and have always
got each others backs.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.600
Like, if one's in trouble,
the other gets them out.

17:45.815 --> 17:48.101
lf one's sad, the other
puts on sparkly eye make-up

17:48.318 --> 17:49.933
and takes them out dancing.

17:51.529 --> 17:55.863
|f one's missing, the other
has even the tiniest inkling

17:56.076 --> 17:57.191
of where they are.

17:57.410 --> 18:01.904
But Bo's missing and
you don't know where she is.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.624
I know. I suck.

18:08.672 --> 18:09.582
Ow!

18:09.798 --> 18:12.164
Tamsin, I told you
not to.. touch anything!

18:13.885 --> 18:17.423
Holy dildos. Is that Bo?

18:17.639 --> 18:19.595
Ow, ow, ow. Okay.

18:19.808 --> 18:21.514
Oh it's... it's
burning, it's burning!

18:21.726 --> 18:22.761
Oh crapity crap.

18:22.978 --> 18:24.843
Oh, it's getting worse.
It's getting worse!

18:25.063 --> 18:26.849
Okay, Play-By-Play, | get it.

18:33.405 --> 18:37.489
M. M. X. V.
What does that mean?

18:37.701 --> 18:42.115
I dunno, probably some crazy
Fae word. D-Man will know.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.031
Do you think Bo's
stuck in the card?

18:51.923 --> 18:53.879
Subtle.

19:01.141 --> 19:05.851
I haven't seen one of these
since my time in France.

19:06.062 --> 19:09.145
|f memory serves, it takes
a great deal of finesse

19:09.357 --> 19:12.064
to unlock a 1879 Joseph Loch.

19:12.277 --> 19:14.017
(knuckles cracking)

19:23.788 --> 19:29.408
Eddy. Eddy!

19:29.627 --> 19:33.415
Eddy! You better not be dead.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.498
Not dead, darling.

19:36.718 --> 19:39.460
Just fast, fast asleep.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.133
Bo?!

19:48.229 --> 19:49.605
Not Bo.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.973
Hey butter fingers!

19:54.194 --> 19:55.604
What do you think
you're doing over here?

19:55.820 --> 19:56.935
Redeco rating?

19:57.155 --> 19:59.897
Well next time put some flowers
on the table or something.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.947
I don't know what
happened. I just uh--

20:02.160 --> 20:03.946
What happened is you've
never waited a table

20:04.162 --> 20:05.527
a day in your life.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.703
Despite what your resume says.

20:08.583 --> 20:13.418
I think um, I think
I lost my name tag.

20:13.630 --> 20:19.000
It's okay. We're all running
from something, "Amber."

20:20.678 --> 20:22.509
| always make such a mess.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.839
You are kind of a huge klutz.

20:26.059 --> 20:30.473
But you're
also cute. And funny.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.556
And... sexy.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.730
You think I'm funny?

20:38.947 --> 20:44.112
I think you need a drink.
Tonight, after closing.

20:44.327 --> 20:47.819
I can't. I'm sorry,
|just can't.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.202
He's just so beautiful.

20:55.422 --> 20:58.539
Eddy, wake up man. Wake up!

20:58.758 --> 21:00.714
Only I can do
that, sweetheart,

21:00.927 --> 21:03.543
and I'm not
about to do it for you.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.220
(growl)

21:06.933 --> 21:08.719
You will wake him.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.095
Or...?

21:10.311 --> 21:13.519
|'|| tear you to
pieces with my teeth.

21:13.731 --> 21:16.598
Promise to spank me first?

21:16.818 --> 21:19.025
If that's what it takes.

21:19.237 --> 21:23.025
Two words. Nuh, uh.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.151
Wake him.

21:24.367 --> 21:25.823
(giggles)

21:26.035 --> 21:30.745
Forget Eddy.
He's out, the wolf is in.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.697
At least he will be.

21:32.917 --> 21:37.832
And all it will
take is just one kiss.

21:38.047 --> 21:42.666
One kiss... and |
end up your prisoner?

21:42.886 --> 21:44.672
Only when you're asleep.

21:44.888 --> 21:50.053
Then one kiss more and
I'm all yours to punish.

21:50.268 --> 21:52.805
That's all I needed to hear.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.136
(growl)

21:57.901 --> 21:59.107
(ga5p)

22:03.948 --> 22:07.691
Now kiss, him.

22:21.925 --> 22:22.630
Eddy?

22:22.842 --> 22:23.752
(grunt)

22:23.968 --> 22:25.344
Harlot.

22:25.553 --> 22:28.010
Eddy? I need your help.

22:28.223 --> 22:32.512
Of course. But first,
help me bind this trollop.

22:32.727 --> 22:36.015
Then we can talk of the great
debt that I owe you, kind sir.

22:38.358 --> 22:42.852
Perhaps mead on me.
Or a Turkish bath.

22:43.071 --> 22:45.187
I need you to help
me find the woman I love.

22:45.406 --> 22:48.990
And what is the name of
this magnificent creature?

22:49.202 --> 22:50.191
Bo.

22:51.746 --> 22:52.781
You're right, Kenz,

22:52.997 --> 22:55.534
lock-picking is skill
every woman should know.

22:57.835 --> 23:02.670
Kenz? I know
that name. It's--

23:02.882 --> 23:04.964
Oh no.

23:07.136 --> 23:10.344
Hey! Is anybody out there?

23:15.812 --> 23:17.348
(bang)

23:17.564 --> 23:18.770
(door opening)

23:19.482 --> 23:20.062
Finally, please--

23:20.275 --> 23:22.015
Shhhh. You'll awaken Him.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.520
Him?

23:23.736 --> 23:26.148
|-| don't think I can say.

23:36.499 --> 23:41.209
Beautiful eyes.
Both brown and blue.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.252
You are the one.

23:43.464 --> 23:46.877
What is this place?
Who is "He?"

23:48.886 --> 23:51.628
You made him angry.

23:51.848 --> 23:53.304
This is all your fault.

23:53.516 --> 23:56.508
(roar)

24:00.523 --> 24:04.357
She's about 5'6, brown eyes,
caucasian. Long brown hair.

24:04.569 --> 24:05.433
Sir this is merely
a description of Bo.

24:05.653 --> 24:08.360
I need you to
tell me about Bo.

24:08.573 --> 24:09.733
Right, is she a suspect?

24:09.949 --> 24:11.905
What, you mean like, "She
dances like no one's watching."

24:12.118 --> 24:13.358
That what you're talking about?

24:13.578 --> 24:15.614
No, I need to know where your
heart lies, and hers as well.

24:15.830 --> 24:16.865
Her heart is her own.

24:17.081 --> 24:17.911
But not entirely yours?

24:18.124 --> 24:18.988
She has a girlfriend.

24:19.208 --> 24:22.621
Ah, the betrayal of a strumpet.

24:22.837 --> 24:25.123
You say that again and
I will rip out your tongue.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.455
My apologies.

24:26.674 --> 24:30.633
But do you have renderings
of these transgressions?

24:33.139 --> 24:34.754
Hey.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.223
Where did you get this?

24:37.435 --> 24:38.390
Kenzi.

24:38.603 --> 24:40.468
Another lover?

24:40.688 --> 24:40.801
She's--

24:41.022 --> 24:42.853
You are Kenzi's
and Kenzi is yours?

24:43.066 --> 24:44.727
No, she's mine!

24:44.942 --> 24:48.685
Mine friend. My friend.

24:48.905 --> 24:50.816
A friend.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.940
Listen, if that is
your Bo on that card,

24:54.160 --> 24:56.902
she's in a heap of trouble.

24:57.997 --> 25:01.285
Eddy, you have to help me.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.958
Apologies, but no.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.583
Are you hungry? I've a
sudden craving for mutton.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.926
She has the
most beautiful heart!

25:14.138 --> 25:16.925
And it breaks every time
someone she loves is hurting.

25:17.141 --> 25:20.929
She's brave, stubborn,
she's passionate.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.848
True.

25:26.734 --> 25:30.022
She loves with
all of her being.

25:30.238 --> 25:32.479
And I can't do
any of this without her.

25:32.699 --> 25:36.112
Now, was that so difficult?

25:36.911 --> 25:37.661
No.

25:37.870 --> 25:38.655
Yeah.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.283
What you just did, that's...

25:41.499 --> 25:43.410
sayin' it out loud
like that, that's hard.

25:43.626 --> 25:46.117
Yes. To delve into
the innermost sanctum

25:46.337 --> 25:48.248
of the heart's desires
is oft deemed one of

25:48.464 --> 25:50.671
life's most arduous journeys.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.795
Hale. You gotta tell her man.

25:54.011 --> 25:54.966
Who?

25:55.179 --> 25:56.589
Don't do that.

25:56.806 --> 25:59.513
Kenzi, you gotta
tell her how you feel.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.341
Kenzi's yours.

26:01.561 --> 26:03.142
Hey, it's not that easy.

26:03.354 --> 26:05.970
All right, I mean just
because you're sure...

26:06.190 --> 26:08.681
Bo is in love with Lauren.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.859
But I still fight for her
because I know how I feel.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.107
Yeah you know, we
need to find Bo, so--

26:14.323 --> 26:16.484
No, no. The Garuda is coming,
your family won't approve,

26:16.701 --> 26:21.240
your pants are too tight.
It has been three years Hale.

26:21.456 --> 26:21.911
You've been longing for her

26:22.123 --> 26:24.455
and she's right
in front of you.

26:31.174 --> 26:32.254
Okay.

26:33.468 --> 26:37.052
That was wonderful.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.673
I say it calls for
a celebratory drink

26:38.890 --> 26:41.427
at your most
unsavoury watering hole.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.598
You and l have work to do.

26:43.811 --> 26:44.800
Yes.

26:47.231 --> 26:48.311
One liver and onions.

26:48.524 --> 26:49.775
Thank you, darling.

26:49.984 --> 26:53.852
Now don't go too far.
I do like that view.

26:56.574 --> 26:59.316
I think that guy just
slapped my butt with his eyes.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.947
How do you put up with
some of these customers?

27:02.163 --> 27:05.121
Same as I put up
with some of the staff.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.620
I'm sorry if I
was rude earlier but--

27:08.836 --> 27:14.376
No good apology ever included
the words "if" and "but."

27:16.427 --> 27:19.214
Um, I'm a jerk. Better?

27:20.765 --> 27:22.926
I'm an egocentric jerk?

27:24.519 --> 27:26.885
Don't be too hard
on yourself, Princess.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.685
And don't be
hard on them either.

27:28.898 --> 27:30.354
Especially about
the butt thing.

27:30.566 --> 27:31.942
l'd slap that.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.437
Yeah, well better
you than bonehead--

27:34.654 --> 27:35.439
Oh my god. He's choking.

27:35.655 --> 27:36.565
What?

27:37.281 --> 27:38.782
Oh my god.

27:39.659 --> 27:42.275
(choking and coughing)

27:42.495 --> 27:45.111
Okay, um. Just help me get
him down, help me get him down.

27:54.382 --> 27:55.792
Oh my god.

27:56.008 --> 28:08.853
(gurgling and gasping)

28:09.063 --> 28:11.600
You're a Ghanian
Diversity Fae, right?

28:11.816 --> 28:20.940
(gurgling and gasping)

28:26.831 --> 28:28.947
Thank you. Phew.

28:31.961 --> 28:34.327
Do you know how much
we can make for this?

28:34.547 --> 28:37.084
I've recorded the
whole alien thing.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.045
EDDY: Otto and I were
great allies, but it was I

28:40.261 --> 28:41.671
who won the
battle of Lechfield.

28:41.888 --> 28:42.627
That's great, how--

28:42.847 --> 28:44.929
How did I do it? Why, by
diverting attention using a

28:45.141 --> 28:47.177
very clever technique
involving smoke, a total of

28:47.393 --> 28:51.306
five dimensional shifts, and
the loud braying of cattle.

28:51.522 --> 28:53.513
Okay so these
dimensional shifts.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.520
We have to move between
them right? How do we do that?

28:56.736 --> 28:58.101
It's complicated.

28:58.321 --> 28:59.106
The woman that
I love is out there

28:59.322 --> 29:01.938
and she's in danger. Please.

29:02.158 --> 29:06.527
If I couldn't find your
Bo, would I have these?

29:12.543 --> 29:13.783
We're being followed.

29:14.003 --> 29:17.245
You see, Dyson, we need
to find an inconsistency.

29:17.465 --> 29:18.625
A shift?

29:18.841 --> 29:21.548
A stutter. Of either the
temporal or physical realms.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.376
Eddy, I think we have both.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.962
Look, the same man appears
in two places at once.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.343
Both move out of time.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.470
Good work.

29:30.686 --> 29:34.554
And the student becomes
the teacher. I jest of course.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.436
Of course.
So now, what do we do?

29:37.652 --> 29:39.643
We go say hello.

29:42.281 --> 29:50.199
Kenzi, you're a man,
I'm a woman. (muttering)

29:50.414 --> 29:55.784
Kenzi, you're a woman. I'm
a man, so it only makes sense.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.165
Wow that is stupid.

29:58.381 --> 30:00.167
Shhhh.

30:01.676 --> 30:04.839
It took like five Avril Lavigne
songs to get Baby Tam-Tam

30:05.054 --> 30:07.670
a ticket to Play-time Land.
You wake her Sk8er Boi,

30:07.890 --> 30:09.801
you are dealing with her.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.633
You know the words to
five Avril Lavigne songs?

30:14.939 --> 30:20.525
Hale? That is so sweet.

30:22.238 --> 30:25.651
These are gonna add that little
boom-boom-pow Bo's room needs.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.026
So wassup, Siren?

30:31.247 --> 30:32.657
I need to tell you something.

30:32.873 --> 30:35.580
Did you guys find Eddy? Is he
like a total tracking genius?

30:35.793 --> 30:36.703
Kind of. But--

30:36.919 --> 30:38.875
But what? Do you guys
have a lead on Bo or not?

30:39.088 --> 30:41.454
Can you stand
still for a second?

30:41.674 --> 30:46.464
Why are you so
twitchy? Is it Bo?

30:46.679 --> 30:48.340
Is she blonde?

30:48.556 --> 30:50.092
Ugh, why am I joking?

30:50.307 --> 30:52.013
What is happening?
Hale, talk to me.

30:52.226 --> 30:53.841
I like you.

30:54.061 --> 30:59.021
Every time I walk into a room,
you are all I can look at.

30:59.233 --> 31:04.478
You have so much style and
strength no human should have.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.109
I want to be a part of that.

31:08.325 --> 31:11.158
I want to be
a part of you too.

31:16.167 --> 31:18.283
Ugh, this is weird.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.163
Good weird?

31:28.512 --> 31:34.098
This is-- This is
all right, right? Right.

31:40.316 --> 31:41.601
Wait, wait!

31:41.817 --> 31:43.648
Less talking,
more everything else.

31:43.861 --> 31:46.728
Oh god, I love
you in purple.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.687
Wait, Little Mama, it's the perfume.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.990
Oh it smells like
a good time to me.

31:51.202 --> 31:52.112
It's a spell.

31:52.328 --> 31:53.317
Aaaahhhhh!

31:53.537 --> 31:54.947
Tamsin.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.450
Oh.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.952
Holy Porita DeGeneres,
Shakira, David Lee Roth.

32:00.169 --> 32:01.500
I woke up and this happened.

32:01.712 --> 32:03.998
Shit, all I've ever
woken up with is a zit.

32:04.215 --> 32:04.704
I'm hideous.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.334
Yeah, you're really not.

32:06.550 --> 32:07.881
Is this some kind of spurt?

32:08.094 --> 32:10.585
Who do I look like? Dr. Spock's
Guide to Growing Valkyries?

32:10.805 --> 32:12.591
Well I don't know,
if she keeps this up,

32:12.807 --> 32:14.843
she's gonna be
Betty White by Tuesday.

32:15.059 --> 32:17.266
Here honey, it's okay,
It's gonna be okay.

32:17.478 --> 32:18.263
Okay.

32:18.479 --> 32:19.434
Hale, tell her
it's gonna be okay.

32:19.647 --> 32:23.185
Everything's gonna
be okay 'cause...

32:23.400 --> 32:24.776
Oh my god, the hair.

32:24.985 --> 32:27.727
...as we grow
our bodies change.

32:27.947 --> 32:30.814
Stuff happens.
Mostly normal.

32:31.033 --> 32:31.317
This is normal?

32:31.534 --> 32:32.569
Ah...

32:32.785 --> 32:34.992
But these things are so big.

32:35.204 --> 32:38.788
Are they stupid?
Can I still jump rope?

32:38.999 --> 32:39.374
No.

32:39.583 --> 32:40.834
Okay yeah, maybe
you should just go.

32:41.043 --> 32:41.998
Hale, jump with me!

32:42.211 --> 32:44.372
No, no, no. Bad Valkyrie.
I mean, bad Hale.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.375
Hale has to go now. But Kenzi?
We are not done talking.

32:47.591 --> 32:48.797
Uh huh.

32:54.598 --> 32:57.055
I feel super bizzaro.

32:57.268 --> 32:58.132
Well I'm sorry
to tell you, kid,

32:58.352 --> 33:01.014
but that's never goin' away.

33:01.230 --> 33:03.437
It's just part of growin' up.

33:12.116 --> 33:14.778
"Smog dog." I've never
had anything so equal parts

33:14.994 --> 33:17.326
disgusting and delicious.

33:17.538 --> 33:19.244
Eddy what is this?

33:20.166 --> 33:24.785
Well... looks like some
sort of condiment dispenser?

33:26.463 --> 33:27.543
What?

33:27.756 --> 33:31.795
Eddy, this is Fae, I can't
read the dialect but...

33:32.011 --> 33:33.842
How long were you
asleep at Selene's?

33:34.054 --> 33:35.669
A few years.
Perhaps a few hundred.

33:35.890 --> 33:37.505
But I am right as gold.

33:37.725 --> 33:39.090
You're obsolete man.
You can't track,

33:39.310 --> 33:41.722
you don't even know
what this thing is.

33:42.563 --> 33:47.557
Of course I do. It is a
simple sequence of buttons.

33:50.738 --> 33:54.071
If you open the gate to another
dimension without a ticket

33:54.283 --> 33:57.366
then we all go kaboom.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.336
Oh no, ow.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.504
Are you okay?

34:11.717 --> 34:15.426
Oh, you hurt me.

34:15.638 --> 34:17.594
I'm sorry.
Eddy are you okay?

34:20.351 --> 34:22.763
Why are you following us?
Why are you so hellbent

34:22.978 --> 34:25.185
on stopping me
from working with Eddy?

34:25.397 --> 34:28.685
He is not Eddy.

34:35.741 --> 34:36.856
I'm Eddy.

34:42.539 --> 34:46.327
This woman's name is Clio and
she is a thief of identities.

34:46.543 --> 34:49.330
What was I supposed to do while
you were under Selene's spell

34:49.546 --> 34:50.205
and between her legs?

34:50.422 --> 34:53.164
Requests for your
services were coming in.

34:53.968 --> 34:55.378
So you took his gigs.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.176
The last one I recall put
you in a hell of a dress.

34:58.389 --> 35:00.971
All he was doing
was making babies.

35:01.183 --> 35:02.138
Wait is Eddy your--?

35:02.351 --> 35:07.311
No. No. His spawn are
giggling, dimwitted Elementals.

35:07.523 --> 35:08.353
But you're an Elemental.

35:08.565 --> 35:09.475
With a twist.

35:09.692 --> 35:12.274
Those elementals
only have command of

35:12.486 --> 35:14.101
one of the four elements.

35:14.321 --> 35:15.822
I commune with all of them.

35:16.031 --> 35:19.148
Which makes me very special
and so much better than you.

35:19.368 --> 35:19.777
Lies!

35:19.994 --> 35:23.111
See, for example, from the
earth that a man was killed

35:23.330 --> 35:26.367
exactly in that
spot 65 years ago.

35:26.583 --> 35:28.539
And I can tell from the water
that the humidity in the air

35:28.752 --> 35:33.496
is exactly 32 or 33%.
And Endymion...

35:33.716 --> 35:37.254
I know that a
train is coming.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.845
(laughing)

35:39.054 --> 35:41.761
You have made a grave
error in crossing me.

35:41.974 --> 35:44.306
I mounted Everest
in four strides,

35:44.518 --> 35:46.474
and mounted the twenty
virgins that live atop.

35:46.687 --> 35:50.225
There have been
songs celebrating me.

35:50.441 --> 35:54.901
Yeah in 1295. Dude
you're all washed up.

35:55.112 --> 35:58.320
J‘ O'er the sea
and across the glen, J‘

35:58.532 --> 36:01.239
J‘ comes the great
and noble Endymion. J‘

36:01.452 --> 36:05.411
J‘ Death and darkness
he doth defy, J‘

36:05.622 --> 36:09.535
J‘Try to kill him,
and he will not die. J‘

36:12.171 --> 36:16.335
Okay so, the next train
comes at quarter after eight.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.415
So we're gonna need a ticket.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.045
Do you have one?

36:21.638 --> 36:22.764
You know, I might.

36:22.973 --> 36:28.218
It's a train ticket?
So what's MMXV?

36:28.437 --> 36:30.644
Whatever unpronounceable
thing that is.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.017
They're Roman
numerals, 2015.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.064
I'm guessing it's a
time... 8:15 p.m.

36:35.277 --> 36:36.858
If we hurry, we can make it.

36:37.071 --> 36:39.357
Yeah but no one can touch
the card without being burned.

36:39.573 --> 36:41.188
|can.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.523
She's an elemental.

36:42.743 --> 36:44.404
Fire can't touch me.

36:44.620 --> 36:46.326
We should talk about my price.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.870
You'll get
whatever you're owed.

36:49.083 --> 36:52.541
Can we umm... can we
have a second? Thank you.

36:55.172 --> 36:58.539
Okay, A: Chickie-poo Elemental
seems a little ele-mental.

36:58.759 --> 37:01.045
B: She can take the
card and bone us big.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.717
And C: Her skin is
suspiciously flawless

37:02.930 --> 37:03.919
and I hate her so much.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.720
Kenz, you have to stay here.

37:05.933 --> 37:07.093
Dyson, please.

37:07.309 --> 37:09.300
Tamsin might
remember something.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.306
All right?

37:11.522 --> 37:16.733
And besides... Hale wants to
talk to you about something.

37:16.944 --> 37:21.734
And when he does, please
try and listen to him, okay?

37:21.949 --> 37:24.156
Right.

37:24.368 --> 37:26.279
Time's-a-ticking.

37:29.331 --> 37:30.912
Bye.

37:40.551 --> 37:42.633
Once we do this,
there is no going back.

37:42.845 --> 37:43.550
And I can't promise
you that I'm going to

37:43.762 --> 37:45.138
be able to protect you.

37:46.098 --> 37:48.885
Who are you? Why did you
try to save me at Engelram's?

37:49.101 --> 37:51.513
Hey! I saw a guy at a
party who was in trouble

37:51.728 --> 37:54.185
and the chance
to make a buck. Okay?

37:54.398 --> 37:55.558
I don't buy that.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.856
You're a cop.
Okay, and your, your,

37:58.068 --> 37:59.729
sleuth friend, what's her--

37:59.945 --> 38:00.058
Ken--

38:00.279 --> 38:02.816
Kenzi. I saw you as
potential competition,

38:03.031 --> 38:04.441
who was busting
in on my territory

38:04.658 --> 38:06.273
and I decided
to check you out.

38:06.493 --> 38:07.949
And it turns out I
have absolutely nothing

38:08.162 --> 38:11.245
to worry about, so
can I please do this?

38:11.457 --> 38:12.071
Time's-a-ticking.

38:12.291 --> 38:13.656
Okay.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.298
Oh man, that worked.

38:23.510 --> 38:24.545
You're surprised?

38:24.761 --> 38:26.422
No, I mean... maybe.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.926
Because, y'know this,
this multidimensional stuff

38:30.142 --> 38:32.178
is quite unpredictable.

38:32.394 --> 38:35.101
(phone ring)

38:36.398 --> 38:37.478
Dyson .

38:37.691 --> 38:40.558
So how's your incision,
did the stitches heal?

38:42.571 --> 38:43.060
Lauren.

38:43.280 --> 38:44.395
Dyson, I want to come home.

38:44.615 --> 38:46.651
They're still looking
for you. It's not safe.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.778
What about the others?
What about Bo?

38:48.994 --> 38:50.074
Dyson I'm scared.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.278
Lauren I don't know if you're
the best rival or the worst

38:52.498 --> 38:55.456
but I know this- you are smart
and you are resourceful.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.373
So whatever needs
to get done, you do it.

38:57.586 --> 38:59.497
Cuz right now
you're on your own.

39:00.380 --> 39:05.716
Thanks. And-- And Dyson...
Take care of her please.

39:13.477 --> 39:15.889
I'll give you triple
what they're paying ya.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.969
Of course I can
afford it, darling.

39:18.190 --> 39:20.431
The only positive of having
your entire race obliterated

39:20.651 --> 39:24.314
is that you inherit one
big bloody bank account.

39:27.157 --> 39:29.273
But we must be
clear about one thing.

39:29.493 --> 39:32.451
Bo must be alive
and in one piece.

39:32.663 --> 39:34.324
Now do we have a deal?

39:34.540 --> 39:36.155
Absolutely.

39:36.375 --> 39:40.243
Well, erect my nipples, you
are a naughty little minx.

39:41.338 --> 39:45.001
Tell me again. Slowly.

39:46.885 --> 39:51.219
Uh, we have a deal.

39:51.431 --> 39:52.716
What deal?

39:52.933 --> 39:58.644
I cannot reveal that, that's
privileged client information.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.436
But...

40:02.317 --> 40:07.653
you have my blood oath that
I will find your Succubus.

40:08.532 --> 40:12.070
(choo-choo of train)

40:21.044 --> 40:23.330
Shit's about
to get interesting.

40:23.547 --> 40:25.913
That's a Death Train.

40:26.717 --> 40:30.710
Ah, ah, ah. Don't
even think about it.

40:39.187 --> 40:42.850
Hold onto your knickers.
Tonight's gonna be a wild ride.

40:50.907 --> 40:54.274
Yes, gone. No more.
Sayonara magic twinkle powers.

40:54.494 --> 40:56.450
Can you meet tonight?

41:00.083 --> 41:02.039
Duh, I can pay.

41:03.462 --> 41:05.123
Yeah I'll see you there.

41:23.940 --> 41:24.804
Feel better?

41:25.025 --> 41:27.107
I barely feel anything.

41:27.319 --> 41:30.106
I'm ah-- Gonna go pee.

41:40.165 --> 41:44.659
Password. Shit.
Maybe it's "shit."

41:46.338 --> 41:47.293
Toad.

41:48.632 --> 41:50.918
It was my dog's
name when I was a kid.

41:51.134 --> 41:54.126
T. O. A. D.
It's ironical, huh?

41:54.346 --> 41:56.132
I was just looking
for your weather app.

41:56.348 --> 41:59.306
8623. You can go ahead.

42:01.353 --> 42:03.719
Oh look it's sunny,
with a side of

42:03.939 --> 42:06.021
you're not buying
any of this are you?

42:06.233 --> 42:08.519
This is about
that alien video.

42:08.735 --> 42:11.727
Do you know how much people
will pay for shit like this?

42:11.947 --> 42:16.031
Look it wasn't an alien, but
listen, this video cannot exist.

42:16.243 --> 42:18.029
There are some
very bad people after me

42:18.245 --> 42:20.327
and if they see this
they'll come for me.

42:20.539 --> 42:24.157
I wish that I could tell
you more, but it's just--

42:24.376 --> 42:25.832
It's complicated.

42:45.021 --> 42:46.602
Wow.

42:46.815 --> 42:47.850
If this is what I
get for letting you

42:48.066 --> 42:49.351
delete things on my phone

42:49.568 --> 42:51.684
I should let you know,
I have over thirty Instagrams

42:51.903 --> 42:54.610
of gas station
sandwiches on here.

42:54.823 --> 42:56.233
I'm Lauren.

42:56.450 --> 42:58.486
It's nice to meet you Lauren.

42:58.702 --> 43:00.192
Thank you.

43:10.338 --> 43:12.294
Just enough.

43:12.507 --> 43:14.759
Just enough to get out.

43:24.728 --> 43:26.559
(door kicked open)

43:32.360 --> 43:34.100
It's time to go.
