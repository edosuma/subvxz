03:20.534 --> 03:21.819

03:21.910 --> 03:24.138
My mom just moved in over there,
so we're doing Thanksgiving.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.368
Oh, nice, man. Nice.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.933
Well, say hi to your mom

03:26.957 --> 03:28.893

03:28.917 --> 03:31.499
Little bit, here and there.

03:31.586 --> 03:33.622
So, you know,

03:33.714 --> 03:35.295

Well, happy Thanksgiving.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.984
Happy Thanksgiving, Jackie.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.319

03:38.343 --> 03:39.570

03:39.594 --> 03:40.655
- Sure.
- Thank you.

04:05.537 --> 04:06.447
Don't fill up on bread.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.904
You gotta eat
the rest of your beans. Okay?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.239
Hey! Happy Thanksgiving.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.895
- Look who's here.
- Hey, uncle Jack's here!

04:12.919 --> 04:15.148
- Hey. Happy Thanksgiving to you.
- How you doing, man?

04:15.172 --> 04:18.039
- Glad you could make it.
- No problem. How's the car business?

04:18.132 --> 04:19.986
- It is going good. Thank you for asking.
- Good.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.089
Would you like some wine?

04:21.178 --> 04:23.009
No. I have some.
Thank you very much.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.381
Hi, uncle fart-poop.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.634
Uncle fart-poop!

04:28.310 --> 04:29.720
Don't tickle me! No, no, no.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.038
- Uncle Jack's getting tickled.
- Hi, sweetheart.

04:31.062 --> 04:31.972
- Hi, mom.
- Mmm.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.583
- Hello, sweetheart.
- All right. Good.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.722
Hey. Happy Thanksgiving.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.772
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi. Really?

04:36.860 --> 04:38.896
- Yeah.
- Some people call when they're late.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.227
I didn't have my phone with me.

04:40.322 --> 04:43.564
Oh. Well, then why have a phone
if you're not gonna use it?

04:43.658 --> 04:45.148
I don't know. That's a good question.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.779
- How you doing, buddy?
- I'm good.

04:46.870 --> 04:47.870
Good to see you.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.474
I don't understand why
somebody has a phone

04:49.498 --> 04:50.829
if they don't ever answer it.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.101
Can I have
some of those potatoes, mom?

04:52.125 --> 04:54.605
- Do you want some potatoes?
- Thank you so much.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.856
Did your mom ever tell you
about our fish tank when we were kids?

04:56.880 --> 04:57.880
No.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.664
Well, your grandmother
took us to the pet store

05:00.759 --> 05:03.171
and we got a fish tank, you know,
a bunch of cool fish.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.217
And I came from school the next day,

05:05.305 --> 05:07.421
and the fish tank
was filled with shampoo.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.724
And all the fish were dead.
And your mom was there crying.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.131
And grandma said, "why'd you put shampoo
in the fish tank?"

05:13.188 --> 05:15.588
And your mom said, "I wanted to give
the fish a bubble bath."

05:16.691 --> 05:18.977
Why'd she give the fish a bubble bath?

05:19.069 --> 05:21.526
You're gonna have to ask your mom.
I don't know.

05:21.613 --> 05:23.653
I guess she always wanted
to take care of everybody.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.357
Mwah. I love you.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.316
Don't let your mom near those fish.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.820
- Good night, uncle Jack.
- Good night, chief.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.711
How's mom, uh, settling in?

05:44.719 --> 05:48.337
Uh, good. Yeah, really good.
She seems to be.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.547
Can't believe you got her outta seaside.

05:50.642 --> 05:54.226
Right? It's different now.
It's just all young kids

05:54.312 --> 05:56.803
- and little couples...
- Yeah.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.685
Running around, families.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.062
I think she was feeling
like a castaway out there.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.236
Yeah, you did good.
I'm glad she's here.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.614
What's going on with you?
What's new?

06:09.494 --> 06:10.700
Not much.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.407
Are you seeing anybody?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.203
No.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.909
I wish you would.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.004
I really do.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.337
I would feel much better.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.694
I hate the idea of you down there
by yourself all the time.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.299
What do you hate about it so much?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.594
That you're, you know, just alone.

06:29.681 --> 06:33.014
Just drinking all the time and not...

06:33.101 --> 06:34.341
I'm fine.

06:34.436 --> 06:37.052
I appreciate it. But it's... I'm fine.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.690
I know that ang worries about you, so...

06:48.241 --> 06:49.572
What does ang have to do with it?

06:50.452 --> 06:52.443
Why do you know
what ang would worry about?

06:53.038 --> 06:55.996
Because she called and she wanted to see
how you were doing.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.288
- She called you?
- Yeah.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.912
- Why?
- Is that okay?

07:01.004 --> 07:03.541
I don't know. I mean, what,
she called you to talk about me?

07:03.632 --> 07:04.859
Why didn't she just call me directly?

07:04.883 --> 07:07.044
She just wanted to see how you're doing.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.210
Well...

07:10.764 --> 07:11.764
I'm fine.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.302
Look, I know Kathy Collins

07:18.396 --> 07:21.479
says she sees your car
outside Harold's bar every night.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.812
Well, if Kathy Collins says it,

07:24.903 --> 07:26.188
- must be true.
- Mmm-hmm.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.815
You know that something must be wrong.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.607
So, I go to work, and then after work
sometimes I go have a beer.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.554
- I'm just saying...
- You better start calling people.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.864
- Okay.
- Better get on this fucking case.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.099
- Okay.
- She has other things

07:37.123 --> 07:38.434
maybe she ought to be worrying about,

07:38.458 --> 07:39.936
instead of worrying
about how much I drink.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.229
I mean, she needs to worry about
staying out of her fucking refrigerator.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.414
- Nice.
- She's losing a huge war

07:44.506 --> 07:46.067
- against the refrigerator.
- What are you talking about? Jack...

07:46.091 --> 07:47.526
- She needs to find a fucking treadmill.
- Stop it.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.586
That is so mean. She's my friend.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.293
Well, she should mind her business.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.490
- Okay.
- That's why I don't come here.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.051
'Cause it always turns to...

07:56.810 --> 07:59.176
Which one of the 20 bedrooms
am I supposed to be staying in?

08:01.356 --> 08:02.937
Take the second one on the left.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.685
Hey, ang, it's Jack.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.027
I'm just, uh...
Happy Thanksgiving.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.906
I wanted to call you,
see how you're doing.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.740
And also because my sister told me

08:21.876 --> 08:25.789
that you had called her
and wanted to know how I was doing.

08:27.757 --> 08:32.251
I'm just saying,
if you want to know in the future

08:33.013 --> 08:34.344
how I'm doing...

08:35.849 --> 08:37.679
You can call me,

08:37.767 --> 08:41.476
as I still have the same phone number

08:42.688 --> 08:43.849
that I had...

08:46.192 --> 08:47.648
When we were married.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.289
Hey, Jack, it's Miguel.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.336
Haven't heard from you
for a while, so...

09:09.424 --> 09:10.630
Sofia was asking about you.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.003
Thought I'd give you a call
and see how you're doing.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.254
Thought maybe we'd have you over...

09:16.431 --> 09:19.093
Hello, Jack,
this is father Edward devine

09:19.184 --> 09:21.049
calling from bishop Hayes high school.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.136
Will you give me a call back here
at the rectory when you get a chance?

09:24.230 --> 09:28.769
1-424-145-3233

09:29.444 --> 09:32.060
and I'll be up until about 10:00
this evening.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.237
If that doesn't work,
we can chat in the morning.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.939
Thanks, Jack. God bless.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.550
- Hello, Jack.
- Hi.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.424
How are you? Come on in.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.925
Thanks so much.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.390
So, did you have
a nice Thanksgiving?

10:03.478 --> 10:06.094
- I did. How about you?
- Oh, it was very nice.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.271
All the kids and the grandkids were in.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.644
- I was in my glory.
- I bet.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.771
- Good for you.
- Oh.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.402
You can go right in here.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.985
Father devine
is just finishing up a call.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.944
So, he will be out
in just a couple of minutes,

10:22.038 --> 10:23.778
so just make yourself comfortable.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.113
Thanks. Yeah.

10:26.584 --> 10:31.169
We are all so excited at the idea
of you possibly coming back

10:31.256 --> 10:34.589
to be with us at Hayes.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.337
It's nice to see you again, Jack.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.252
Hello, Jack.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.761
Hey, father.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.761
It's good to see you.
Thanks for making the drive.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.093
- Sure. No problem.
- Sit down, please.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.311
So, been a while, hasn't it?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.767
Yeah. Since, uh...

11:36.946 --> 11:38.231
My father's funeral.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.688
- That long?
- Mmm_

11:39.782 --> 11:42.649
My goodness.
Where does the time go?

11:42.744 --> 11:44.985
If I knew, I would tell ya.

11:45.079 --> 11:48.196
- Married?
- I'm separated now. For a while.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.539
- Any children?
- No kids.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.038
Okay.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.336
Well, Jack, it is really good
to see you again.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.631
And I suppose you're wondering
why I called you over here.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.083
I'm a little curious. Yeanh.

12:01.304 --> 12:04.262
Our basketball coach, Tom mcgarity,
had a heart attack the other night.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.589
Oh, no.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.219
He's expected to make a full recovery,

12:07.310 --> 12:09.221
but his wife doesn't think
it's a very good idea

12:09.312 --> 12:11.519
for him to return to the team.

12:11.606 --> 12:12.846
And I tend to agree.

12:13.608 --> 12:17.271
We need a new coach, Jack.
You're the first person I thought of.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.231
Try to suppress your enthusiasm.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.026
No, I appreciate it.
I just... it's, um...

12:26.120 --> 12:28.720
You know, it's just, I've been away
from the game for a long time.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.158
I understand. I understand.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.241
You know,
I've never even coached before.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.166
I just played, so I don't...

12:34.254 --> 12:36.336
Is the, uh... I mean...

12:36.422 --> 12:37.753
Is the team any good?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.455
No. No.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.132
We haven't been competitive
for quite a while, actually.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.510
In fact, the last time
they made the playoffs?

12:44.973 --> 12:46.179
Back when you were playing.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.260
Wow.

12:49.060 --> 12:52.018
Well, I really appreciate you
thinking of me, father.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.145
- It's just, I...
- Go home and think it over, Jack.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.709
Well, I got a lot going on
in my life right now.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.190
- It's very busy.
- Go home, think it over.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.525
Call me with your decision
in the morning.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.654
- Tomorrow morning?
- Our next game is Monday night, Jack.

13:03.741 --> 13:04.947
I don't have a lot of time.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.956
Hey, father, listen, I...

13:14.043 --> 13:14.953
Mmm...

13:15.044 --> 13:18.832
Thank you so much
for thinking of me. Um...

13:19.549 --> 13:24.464
It's just not the right time for me
to take this on. Um...

13:25.555 --> 13:29.924
You know, my life's very full right now.
Very full.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.185
I just, um...

13:34.647 --> 13:37.559
I've just been away from the game
for so long, you know?

13:38.109 --> 13:39.940
I've just been away from the game
for so long.

13:45.825 --> 13:46.985
Father...

13:47.076 --> 13:50.364
Listen, I've given it a lot of thought,
and I appreciate it.

13:50.455 --> 13:54.368
It's just not the right time for me
right now.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.616
I've been away from the game
for so long.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.997
I don't think I can help you.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.002
I don't think...

14:02.008 --> 14:03.464
I don't think I can help you.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.711
I don't think I can help you.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.589
Father. Jack.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.683
Not gonna happen.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.668
What the fuck am I supposed to do?

14:19.692 --> 14:21.712
The team can't play. They're no good.
They're no good.

14:21.736 --> 14:24.398
I can't wave a magic wand,
turn them into fucking Michael Jordan.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.604
I mean, just...

14:30.453 --> 14:31.453
I don't know.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.905
Maybe.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.240
I don't know.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.047
I can't help you with this.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.837
I can't help you with this team.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.951
Father, I've given it a lot of thought.

15:16.124 --> 15:19.036
I just have no interest in coaching
your fucking basketball team.

15:22.713 --> 15:23.753
That's all there is to it.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.647
Oh, fuck.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.180
Get back on d!

15:55.204 --> 15:56.849
Make up for it.

15:56.873 --> 15:57.953
What the fuck?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.040
Hey, g. G!

16:01.461 --> 16:04.919
D up! Hey, get back!
Let's go! Let's go!

16:05.506 --> 16:08.213
Move! Go quick!
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.883
Stop him up top.
Chubbs, go to the wing.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.381
Watch it.
Screen, screen, screen.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.993
Yo, get through, get through.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.433
Get through that.

16:16.726 --> 16:17.726
Hey, freeze.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.095
Go!

16:19.187 --> 16:20.456
- Good pass.
- Come on!

16:20.480 --> 16:22.200
- Hey, nice job, d-boy.
- What's up, chubbs?

16:23.149 --> 16:24.355
Hey, coach.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.482
Dan Espinosa. Nice to meet ya.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.935
- You're the assistant?
- I am.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.941
Uh, I also teach algebra
here at the school.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.690
Uh, I really appreciate you
stepping up like this.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.069
It means a lot to the boys.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.526
Um, do you want me to call everybody in,

16:37.622 --> 16:38.849
- do some intros?
- No, that's okay.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.684
- Take the layup, Marcus!
- Money!

16:40.708 --> 16:42.811
Just, uh, get a feel for
what I'm working with here.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.871
- Yeah.
- This the whole team? Ten kids?

16:45.755 --> 16:46.755
That's all we've got.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.484
A lot different than
when you played here, huh?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.588
Yeah. No shit.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.290
We got 100 kids just try out.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.921
104 my senior year.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.716
- Play ball here?
- Well, I mean, not like you.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.758
Spent most of my time on the bench,
holding a clipboard like I am now.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.893
I was a couple of years behind you.
Uh, class of '98.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.938
Enroliment's really taken a dive
since then.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.357
Freeze, freeze, freeze!

17:08.444 --> 17:10.480
I can run down the starting five,
if you like.

17:10.570 --> 17:11.570
- Box out!
- Sure.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.776
So, uh, the kid with the ball,
that's Brandon durrett.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.396
Relation to Russ durrett?

17:15.701 --> 17:16.941
Yeah, that's his son.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.285
He's a great player.
Really has a good feel for the game.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.162
Easily our most talented guy.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.874
And then, um, playing besides him
in the backcourt,

17:25.962 --> 17:27.247
that's chubbs Hendricks.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.042
His, uh, real name's Ronald.

17:30.508 --> 17:31.735
- Oh, yeah.
- Right here, this man.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.296
And, um,
Kenny dawes out on the wing.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.633
Bit of a showboat, but, uh...

17:37.723 --> 17:38.838
Yeah, he's a solid shooter.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.673
- Whoo!
- Good long-range stroke.

17:40.768 --> 17:41.632
Get back! Get back!

17:41.727 --> 17:44.013
Sam Garcia,
he's our senior captain.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.937
Not much of a scoring threat,
but he's a solid defender.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.024
Good kid.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.765
And then Marcus Parrish.

17:50.111 --> 17:51.111
Money!

17:51.153 --> 17:51.983
That is our center.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.090
What the fuck
are you doing, bro?

17:53.114 --> 17:54.466
- That kid's the center?
- Yeah.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.650
What is he, 6'4"?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.402
- Shut the fuck up, man.
- 6'3"

17:58.160 --> 17:59.760
you guys must get murdered
on the boards.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.743
Yeah, it's not been good at all.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.934
You're giving 'em
open buckets, Marcus.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.269
This is practice, man.
I don't care.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.812
Who's that kid there?
The white shadow.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.418
Oh, yeah, that's, uh, Bobby freeze.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.915
He's our sixth man.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.840
He's actually a starting strong safety
for the football team.

18:15.094 --> 18:19.713
Then the rest of the guys, uh,
dearborn, daly, Carter, and amato.

18:19.807 --> 18:23.095
I had to bring those guys up from jv
just so we could hold a practice.

18:23.394 --> 18:24.413
- Take the layup!
- Money!

18:24.437 --> 18:25.477
Come on, box out!

18:26.272 --> 18:27.374
All right. Blow the whistle for me.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.001
- Freeze. Chill out, man.
- Yo, take it easy, man.

18:29.025 --> 18:29.935
Stop grabbing me.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.211
That's clean. That's clean d.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.601
Bring it in. Let's go.
Hustle, hustle.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.404
All right, guys. As discussed,

18:36.741 --> 18:39.824
I am honored to turn things over
to your new head coach,

18:40.202 --> 18:41.282
Jack Cunningham.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.389
What's up, coach?

18:42.413 --> 18:44.349
- How you doing, guys?
- Good. Good.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.413
What's up, coach?

18:46.167 --> 18:47.287
You're Marcus, right?

18:47.877 --> 18:50.539
That's right.
Get used to calling my name, too.

18:51.881 --> 18:55.465
All right. All right.
Marcus, tell me what you see out there.

18:56.677 --> 18:57.677
Um...

18:58.429 --> 19:01.592
I see Nikki's
fine ass keep looking at me.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.305
Saw she was bending over.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.078
- She tryin' to get my attention.
- Marcus, just be respectful, please.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.039
He asked me what I saw.
What, do you want me to lie to him?

19:07.063 --> 19:08.503
You know what I see, Marcus?
âWhat?

19:08.814 --> 19:10.930
- You're the tallest player on the team.
- Oh.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.836
Makes me wonder why you're putting
three-pointers up

19:12.860 --> 19:13.920
every time you come down the court.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.900
Oh, that's 'cause
I got a candy-stroke, coach.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.564
Ask coach Dan. I made the most threes
on the team last year.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.158
Coach Dan, how many threes
did Marcus make last year?

19:22.662 --> 19:23.947
Um, Marcus...

19:25.331 --> 19:26.195
Made 34.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.530
Outta how many attempts?

19:27.625 --> 19:30.082
Out of 130.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.563
What's that a percentage of?

19:31.587 --> 19:33.452
For a percentage of 26.

19:33.547 --> 19:34.377
Damn!

19:34.465 --> 19:36.080
26%, Marcus.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.819
You wanna know
why they're leaving you open?

19:37.843 --> 19:40.523
It's 'cause they don't think
you could hit the ocean from the beach.

19:40.596 --> 19:42.032
Oh, shit.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.047
Yo, he just spit facts at your ass, bro.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.619
- Man, shut up.
- Look it, come on, man.

19:45.643 --> 19:48.080
Don't get all butt-hurt just 'cause
he droppin' some knowledge on you.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.539
You wanna see butt-hurt?
Keep talking shit,

19:49.563 --> 19:51.375
- watch me beat your fat ass.
- Shut the fuck up, yo.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.959
- You ain't gonna do shit.
- Hey.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.439
I don't need any help.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.941
Who is second in threes on the team?

20:00.032 --> 20:03.650
Number two would be Kenny with 25.

20:03.828 --> 20:04.828
Outta how many attempts?

20:05.246 --> 20:06.827
- Sixty-one.
- Percentage of?

20:07.081 --> 20:09.117
Forty-one.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.072
Snap. You hear that?

20:10.167 --> 20:11.603
Give me the rock,
let me go ham on some bitches.

20:11.627 --> 20:13.367
Yeah, more like ham and cheese, man.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.357
Nah, actually, ham and cheese
is what your sister

20:15.381 --> 20:17.167
fries me up after I'm done
fiddling her bean.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.568
Yo, show some respect.
Coach is here, man.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.404
- Watch your mouth, man.
- Kenny, get in line.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.446
All right, run it back.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.461
Marcus, this time your feet
don't leave the paint.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.825
- Brandon.
- All right. Let's go. Come on.

20:24.849 --> 20:25.713
Let's go, y'all.

20:25.808 --> 20:29.300
You're the point guard, right?
Put 'em in a motion offense.

20:33.482 --> 20:34.751
- Chubbs.
- Call it out, Brandon.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.265
Don't just wave your hand in the air.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.942
Doesn't talk much, does he?

20:38.028 --> 20:40.314
Well, I have been coaching
that kid for three years

20:40.406 --> 20:43.273
and I can count on one hand
how many times our conversations

20:43.367 --> 20:45.779
have gone past,
"yes, coach" and "no, coach."

20:45.870 --> 20:47.806
- Good shot, baby.
- And that's money!

20:47.830 --> 20:48.865
Here you go.

20:49.707 --> 20:54.542
Keys, game balls,
and then I put together a flash drive

20:54.628 --> 20:57.461
just in case you want to get familiar
with the sets we've been running.

20:57.631 --> 21:01.465
I'm also gonna give you my phone number
if you have any questions.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.261
Okay.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.302
Hey, why didn't you take the job?

21:05.389 --> 21:06.720
Huh? âWould've made sense.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.763
The assistant coach,
step in, take the job.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.806
My mom has ms, so...

21:12.897 --> 21:14.577
My sister takes care of her
during the day,

21:14.607 --> 21:16.222
but she's got three kids of her own.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.478
So I take nights.

21:18.569 --> 21:19.979
- Sure.
- Then with practices,

21:20.070 --> 21:21.230
and then you have scouting...

21:21.280 --> 21:22.382
Yeah, no. Of course. It makes sense.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.925
There just aren't enough hours
in the day.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.094
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
- No, no, no. It's cool.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.904
We all have
our own cross to bear, right?

21:29.079 --> 21:31.320
Um... so you should be good.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.951
Great. Thank you very much.

21:33.042 --> 21:34.042
No problem.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.164
Oh, coach. Yeah?

21:38.422 --> 21:39.958
What's the dress code like these days?

21:40.591 --> 21:42.422
Oh. Coat and tie for the head coach.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.702
- Great. Thanks.
- Sure. No problem.

22:58.752 --> 22:59.752
Yeah!

23:01.422 --> 23:03.083
Right here, right here. Yeah!

23:03.549 --> 23:04.549
Here we go!

23:05.926 --> 23:07.086
Yeah!

23:07.469 --> 23:08.469
Take the shot.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.011
That's you, Marcus.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.888
Hey, Jack.
Nice to see you in the gym again.

23:13.976 --> 23:14.976
Thanks.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.478
That's you.

23:17.521 --> 23:21.389
Jack, this is father Mark whelan.
He is our team chaplain.

23:21.483 --> 23:22.768
Pleasure to meet you, Jack.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.067
- You too.
- Any first game jitters?

23:25.154 --> 23:26.564
Fuck. I'm nervous as shit.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.488
Yeah. âWhat's this?

23:29.575 --> 23:33.067
Oh. They do it before every game.
Gets them psyched up, I guess.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.618
Let's go!

23:34.955 --> 23:36.286
All right, let's go. Bring it in.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.370
- Ready?
- No.

23:40.461 --> 23:41.496
Let's go.

23:41.962 --> 23:44.082
All right, guys.
I et's see what we're made of.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.239
And the big burly inmate says,
"don't worry about it.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.743
Everything's gonna be fine.
I just want to play a little game."

23:53.849 --> 23:54.884
He goes, "okay."

23:54.975 --> 23:56.535
And he says,
"in this game, you can pick

23:56.602 --> 23:58.934
whether or not you want
to be the husband or the wife."

23:59.021 --> 24:00.761
And he says, "all right."
"Well?"

24:01.106 --> 24:02.687
"Well, guess I'll be the husband."

24:02.775 --> 24:03.775
He goes, "okay.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.648
Come on over here
and suck your wife's dick."

24:05.736 --> 24:07.522
That's a good one.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.341
"Suck your wife's dick."
I fucking love that.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.151
- Hey, doc.
- Hey.

24:11.575 --> 24:12.815
How'd opening night go, Ace?

24:13.077 --> 24:15.033
Yeah, our boy got sent to the woodshed.

24:15.329 --> 24:18.321
Hey, get doc a drink, will ya?
And hit me with another one.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.870
Doc, did I ever tell you the one
about the nerdy accountant

24:21.961 --> 24:23.576
who does 15 years for embezzlement?

24:23.837 --> 24:26.874
- Don't worry about me.
- I'm not. I know.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.708
Just let me do... do my thing.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.509
- Do your thing.
- All right. I appreciate it.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.336
- Okay.
- I'm just gonna...

24:35.182 --> 24:37.468
- All right. Good night, doc.
- Good night.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.149
Get your man! Get your man!

25:37.244 --> 25:38.244
Come on!

25:39.413 --> 25:40.413
Watch him.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.050
Jackie! It's Miguel again.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.427
Just checking in to see
if you got my call

26:01.518 --> 26:03.008
about David's birthday party.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.593
Give me a call when you get a chance.

26:05.773 --> 26:08.389
Hey, it's me.
I know it's late notice,

26:08.484 --> 26:11.442
but I'm gonna be down by you
for a client visit tomorrow

26:11.779 --> 26:14.646
and wanted to see
if you wanted to meet for lunch.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.696
Anyway, call me when you get this.

26:30.464 --> 26:32.295
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:32.883 --> 26:33.883
Sorry I'm late.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.626
Damn bus broke down on the 710.
It was a nightmare.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.882
- I just got here.
- Okay.

26:40.849 --> 26:41.849
You look good.

26:42.559 --> 26:43.969
Thanks. You too.

26:44.478 --> 26:45.678
How's the new job working out?

26:46.146 --> 26:50.355
It's insurance.
It's boring, but it pays the bills.

26:50.651 --> 26:51.651
Good.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.560
Heard you're coaching basketball.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.395
Beth tell you that? Yeah.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.316
So, you having fun?

27:00.410 --> 27:01.410
Yeanh.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.615
I'd be having more fun
if we won a game...

27:05.541 --> 27:09.033
But keeps me occupied.
Keeps my mind off other things.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.627
Good. I was worried about you.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.042
What were you worried about me for?

27:17.970 --> 27:20.712
You weren't moving on with your life.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.764
You were seeing the world
in some dark ways.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.394
Why? Are you?

27:27.855 --> 27:29.220
Seeing the world in dark ways?

27:29.940 --> 27:31.225
Moving on with your life.

27:40.742 --> 27:41.742
Uh-oh.

27:49.710 --> 27:50.710
What's his name?

27:56.508 --> 27:57.508
Nick.

28:01.847 --> 28:02.882
How'd you guys meet?

28:04.349 --> 28:05.509
Through mutual friends.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.343
How long has it been going on for?

28:12.065 --> 28:13.065
Few months.

28:15.027 --> 28:18.360
Few months? What, like, six months?
Eight months?

28:18.447 --> 28:20.233
Okay. All right. Come on.

28:20.324 --> 28:22.004
You know what we want for lunch?

28:23.535 --> 28:24.535
Um...

28:25.871 --> 28:27.657
Just give us a second, actually.
Thank you.

28:27.748 --> 28:28.748
Sure.

28:40.302 --> 28:41.462
I wanted to tell you myself

28:41.553 --> 28:43.509
before you found out
through one of our friends.

28:52.689 --> 28:53.849
Say something, Jack.

28:56.318 --> 28:59.526
What do you want me to say?
"Congratulations"?

28:59.613 --> 29:00.523
No.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.550
- Completely fucking blindsided by this.
- Not "congratulations."

29:02.574 --> 29:05.782
Blindsided?
We've been separated for over a year.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.246
Will I see you at the birthday party?

29:21.677 --> 29:22.677
What?

29:23.679 --> 29:24.543
Miguel and Sofia.

29:24.638 --> 29:26.299
They're having
a birthday party for David.

29:27.557 --> 29:29.388
Said he called you a few times.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.221
Let me know if you want to go together.

29:44.700 --> 29:45.700
Bye.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.224
Jackie hits his second free throw

30:16.315 --> 30:19.478
and he just holds his hand like this
in the air for like 30 seconds.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.689
Purcell says, "Jackie, you keep holding
your hand like that

30:22.779 --> 30:24.064
and Eric's gonna ask you out."

30:26.074 --> 30:27.780
Fifty-five points, man.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.927
- To the legend.
- Yeah.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.347
You gotta dim the lights
for the man.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.251
- To the legend.
- To the legend.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.035
Get the fuck outta here.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.745
Why the fuck do I need a sausage?

30:41.840 --> 30:44.422
He was like,
"it's a pk. It's a Polish kielbasa."

30:46.261 --> 30:48.502
Ah. Yeah.

30:49.139 --> 30:51.255
Fellas. Evening, boys.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.787
We're talking old times here.

30:54.811 --> 30:55.955
I know what you're talking,

30:55.979 --> 30:58.095
and I'm telling you it's time for him
to get going.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.476
Come on, let's go now.
Come on. Let's go.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.228
- I'm up.
- No, you're not.

31:02.319 --> 31:03.729
Now you are!

31:05.739 --> 31:06.899
I'm up.

31:08.158 --> 31:09.193
Whoa!

31:09.284 --> 31:11.275
- Shit.
- There you go. That's it.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.432
Where are you taking my friend?
Where are you taking my friend?

31:27.302 --> 31:30.465
Okay, okay. Uh, where's Kenny?

31:31.390 --> 31:33.230
Kenny is the only one missing.
Kenny and coach.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.246
I just want you to know
that I respect you, a'ight?

31:37.270 --> 31:38.635
- And I love you.
- Hmm.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.166
Every time that ball
goes through the hoop,

31:40.190 --> 31:41.584
- I'm gonna be thinking about you.
- Kenny.

31:41.608 --> 31:42.877
Okay? And that goes
through the hoop a lot.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.981
- Kenny, let's go! The bus is waiting.
- Okay.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.445
Hey, what up, coach?

31:48.448 --> 31:51.168
- Bye. Yeah, I'll text you after. Okay.
- You'll text me? Okay. Cool.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.241
Hey, what's going on, man?

31:53.161 --> 31:54.697
- Good luck!
- Thanks.

31:55.372 --> 31:56.782
You better watch out.

31:56.873 --> 31:57.892
Priests catch you doing that

31:57.916 --> 31:59.352
and you're gonna be spending
your weekends here.

31:59.376 --> 32:01.537
Nah, but it makes
my game better though, coach.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.624
Memorial!

32:05.507 --> 32:09.750
Memorial! Memorial!

32:10.470 --> 32:12.426
Memorial!

32:12.889 --> 32:14.971
Memorial!

32:15.308 --> 32:17.515
Memorial!

32:17.894 --> 32:20.135
Memorial!

32:20.814 --> 32:22.805
Memorial!

32:23.442 --> 32:25.182
Memorial!

32:25.277 --> 32:26.392
Let's go.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.064
Hold on, hold on.

32:29.156 --> 32:30.191
I want to talk to you.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.648
These scrubs ain't worthy of being
on the same court as us.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.362
- Hey, coach.
- Hey, coach.

32:51.386 --> 32:52.922
- How are ya?
- Good, good.

32:53.013 --> 32:54.407
I heard you got a new general in charge.

32:54.431 --> 32:55.716
Yeah. Jack Cunningham.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.889
Yeah. I'm surprised you could keep him
out of the bar

32:57.976 --> 32:59.466
long enough to hold practice.

33:06.902 --> 33:08.187
Coach lombardo.

33:08.278 --> 33:09.484
Jack Cunningham.

33:09.571 --> 33:11.436
He says that
like I don't know who he is.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.863
He's the best high school
basketball player I've ever seen.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.654
Listen, I was front row when he hung 47

33:16.745 --> 33:18.736
against Trinity
at the catholic league semis.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.947
Got quite a team there, coach.
21's a hell of a ball player.

33:22.042 --> 33:24.499
Yeah. So, how ya liking coaching so far?

33:24.586 --> 33:26.355
Great.
Just getting used to the players.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.619
What players?

33:28.173 --> 33:29.879
Ah, I'm just breaking your stones, Jack.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.112
- Good luck.
- You can have the luck.

33:33.136 --> 33:34.592
I'll take the thoroughbreds.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.551
What an asshole this guy is.

33:37.641 --> 33:38.721
Yeah, big time.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.438
Let's go. Bring it in.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.590
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

33:52.614 --> 33:53.444
Holy shit.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.132
Here we go,
here we go, here we go.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.781
Chubbs. Hey!

33:57.536 --> 33:58.696
No more dancing.

33:59.621 --> 34:00.827
Coach, are you serious?

34:00.914 --> 34:02.870
Yeah. I'm serious.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.118
We're one in nine.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.541
You're out there jumping around
like you hit the powerball.

34:06.628 --> 34:07.959
You're embarrassing yourself.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.899
Win a few games,
we can talk about bringing it back.

34:09.922 --> 34:11.833
But for now, that act's retired.
Got it?

34:12.342 --> 34:13.342
Yeanh.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.344
One, two, three.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.396
Hey. Help, help.

34:34.364 --> 34:35.649
Let's go!

34:38.076 --> 34:39.156
Motion, motion.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.389
Let's go! Bring him through.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.277
Hey, hey.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.703
Back up, back up.

34:49.504 --> 34:50.504
Oh, yeah!

34:52.047 --> 34:53.408
Show hands. Let's go, guys.

34:54.384 --> 34:55.384
You guys gotta move.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.000
Oh, yeah!

34:57.094 --> 34:58.775
Let's go. Lock him up.
Lock him up.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.119
- Fuck.
- Come on.

35:05.729 --> 35:06.593
Time-out!

35:06.688 --> 35:08.528
Get over here.
All right. Listen up.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.564
- Come on.
- Fuck.

35:12.402 --> 35:13.642
Get back. Get back!

35:25.665 --> 35:30.159
Defense, defense, defense!

35:30.253 --> 35:33.336
- Back screen, back screen.
- You guys gotta move! Set picks!

35:33.757 --> 35:34.837
Then squeeze!

35:36.968 --> 35:39.209
Go.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

35:40.680 --> 35:41.680
Shoot!

35:42.557 --> 35:43.637
Watch the clock!

35:43.725 --> 35:47.764
Five, four, three, two, one!

35:52.108 --> 35:53.108
Time-out!

35:54.527 --> 35:55.437
Full time-out.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.438
Let's go. Bring it in.

35:56.529 --> 35:57.393
Come on. Let's go.

35:57.489 --> 35:58.489
Nobody sits down.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.188
Stand up. Stand up.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.198
I thought I said to force him left.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.866
- Coach, I'm trying.
- Try harder.

36:04.204 --> 36:05.865
What did I say
about fading off your man?

36:06.081 --> 36:07.446
Why's shit always my fault?

36:07.749 --> 36:09.080
Freeze, sub in for Marcus.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.561
- You taking me out?
- That's right.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.585
Sit the fuck down.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.626
This is some bullshit, man.

36:13.713 --> 36:14.793
Listen to me.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.422
I want every one of you to reach
in your shorts right now

36:17.509 --> 36:18.919
and tell me if you find a pair.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.676
'Cause right now, you're playing
like a bunch of fucking pussies.

36:21.805 --> 36:22.840
And that's the truth.

36:23.223 --> 36:25.009
Next time 32 goes
over your back like that,

36:25.100 --> 36:26.494
put a fucking elbow in his stomach.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.348
Yes, coach.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.580
And if childress tries to put you
on a poster like that,

36:29.604 --> 36:30.468
you hit him so fucking hard

36:30.563 --> 36:32.394
he never comes down the Lane
like that again.

36:32.482 --> 36:33.312
I got you.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.502
Have a little fucking pride.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.983
I don't give a shit if we lose
every fucking game this year.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.777
I will not coach a team
that has been out-toughed.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.355
All right? Let's go!

36:41.449 --> 36:42.529
Fuck yeah, man. Here we go.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.053
"Team" on three.
One, two, three.

36:44.077 --> 36:45.077
Team!

36:50.834 --> 36:51.994
I'm in for 50.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.739
Come on. Switch up, switch up!

37:03.054 --> 37:04.054
Chubbs.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.014
Let's go, 3.

37:07.892 --> 37:08.892
Come on!

37:15.525 --> 37:16.725
Hey, hey, hey. Chill.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.062
Get back here. Get back here.

37:19.154 --> 37:22.021
Get the fuck off, bro.
Hey, get the fuck off, bro.

37:22.490 --> 37:25.482
Bro, I'll beat your ass.
I'll fuck you up, bitch.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.495
That is a flagrant foul.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.060
Hey, that's enough.
That's enough.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.937
I didn't do fucking anything, man.
Watch yourself.

37:34.961 --> 37:36.063
- Get back there.
- Get over there!

37:36.087 --> 37:38.294
What the hell is that?
That guy should be out.

37:38.381 --> 37:40.667
Control your players, Cunningham.

37:40.759 --> 37:42.236
That is bullshit, man.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.125
What the hell? Come on!

37:47.015 --> 37:48.630
Right. All right.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.465
I'm feeling a comeback.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.403
Jack? Yeah.

38:12.207 --> 38:13.492
Uh...

38:14.250 --> 38:16.115
Just wanted to have a little chat
with you

38:16.211 --> 38:17.701
about something that was on my mind.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.706
Um, I don't know if you recall
from your days as a student,

38:22.801 --> 38:26.043
but we have a code of conduct at Hayes.

38:26.679 --> 38:30.046
Part of that code includes
the use of appropriate language.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.716
I understand you're trying to
motivate the team,

38:32.811 --> 38:35.268
I just wonder if maybe
there's a different approach.

38:36.731 --> 38:37.766
So, you would, uh...

38:39.275 --> 38:40.995
You would like me to be
a little more, uh...

38:42.612 --> 38:43.818
Christlike on the bench?

38:44.989 --> 38:46.695
I'd like you to keep in mind

38:46.783 --> 38:49.695
that our mission at Hayes
isn't to win basketball games.

38:49.786 --> 38:52.118
It's to develop men
of integrity and faith.

38:52.914 --> 38:55.621
Just give it some thought for me.
Will you do that?

38:56.209 --> 38:57.699
- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.539
Father, let me ask you something.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.502
With all the terrible stuff
going on in the world,

39:05.009 --> 39:06.111
you think who's ever up there

39:06.135 --> 39:08.091
really gives a shit
what I say to these kids?

39:09.514 --> 39:11.505
As christians, we are called by god

39:11.599 --> 39:13.715
to integrate our faith
into our daily lives.

39:13.810 --> 39:15.926
So, yes, Jack. I do think
he really gives a shit

39:16.020 --> 39:18.102
about the example you set
for these young men.

39:19.607 --> 39:21.973
Don't underestimate the impact
you can have on them.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.809
All right.
I'll take a look at the game tape.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.824
We can talk about if we wanna use
that 1-3-1 zone.

39:38.918 --> 39:40.249
Got it. Sounds good.

39:40.461 --> 39:41.461
Have a good night.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.130
Hey, Jack. Yeah?

39:51.514 --> 39:54.176
I noticed some empty beer cans
in the office earlier.

39:55.977 --> 39:58.057
- Do you...
- You've been sneaking around the office?

39:58.271 --> 40:01.058
Well, Garcia lost a contact lens,
so the solution...

40:01.149 --> 40:02.668
A friend came by.
He wanted to look at some...

40:02.692 --> 40:03.692
And we were hanging out.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.357
I mean, you're not gonna break my balls
about a couple of beer cans, are ya?

40:08.907 --> 40:10.568
Just don't let it happen again, okay?

40:11.326 --> 40:12.326
Yeah, no problem.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.555
Hey, hey, Jackie!

40:42.649 --> 40:44.139
I'll set you up inside, all right?

41:54.595 --> 41:56.961
All right. We're gonna
change things up a little bit.

41:57.890 --> 42:00.411
We're the smallest team in the league
and our half-court offense sucks.

42:00.435 --> 42:02.767
We're gonna score some points
with defense. We gotta press.

42:03.354 --> 42:06.687
1-2-1-1.
Call it the diamond press.

42:06.774 --> 42:07.876
Requires two things,

42:07.900 --> 42:10.016
toughness and quickness.

42:10.611 --> 42:12.977
We're gonna be picking up
after every dead ball.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.858
Full court, all game.

42:16.909 --> 42:18.319
Keep your clothes on, Marcus.

42:19.412 --> 42:20.322
Talking to me?

42:20.413 --> 42:21.903
Come late to the game,
you don't play.

42:21.998 --> 42:23.517
We'll talk about it
at practice tomorrow.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.782
What are you talking about?
I'm, like, four minutes late.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.708
You know what? Forget about tomorrow.
Go home. You're off the team.

42:31.883 --> 42:34.295
Coach Dan, what the hell is his problem?
I'm barely late.

42:34.594 --> 42:36.801
You heard coach, Marcus.
Go home.

42:36.888 --> 42:39.300
Are you
fucking serious right now?

42:39.599 --> 42:41.055
I'm barely fucking late.

42:43.936 --> 42:47.053
Y'all fucking stupid, man.
This dumb-ass team.

42:50.985 --> 42:52.270
Freeze, you're starting tonight.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.653
Means you're gonna be guarding
the inbounder, okay?

42:54.947 --> 42:55.947
Got it, coach.

43:00.620 --> 43:01.780
Ah, this should be fun.

43:01.871 --> 43:03.271
- Evening, sal.
- What's up, Jackie?

43:03.414 --> 43:04.975
Give us some friendly whistles tonight,
will you?

43:04.999 --> 43:07.519
Yeah, right. That's funny.
They ain't paying me enough for that.

43:07.543 --> 43:09.454
Let's go. Here we go.

43:10.963 --> 43:12.123
Freeze, freeze, freeze!

43:12.173 --> 43:13.984
- Hands up. Hands up!
- Freeze, help! Help out.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.088
Freeze, help!

43:16.427 --> 43:17.712
That's it!

43:18.221 --> 43:20.803
- What? Come on, ref.
- What's the call, ref?

43:20.890 --> 43:23.006
White 23 blocked. Two shots.

43:23.101 --> 43:24.637
Oh, bullshit!

43:24.977 --> 43:25.977
Come on!

43:26.104 --> 43:27.414
That's a fucking horseshit call, sal.

43:27.438 --> 43:28.540
Jack, settle down
or it's gonna cost you.

43:28.564 --> 43:29.394
It's bullshit.

43:29.482 --> 43:32.642
- And you know it's fucking horseshit.
- That's why I didn't make it. All right?

43:32.693 --> 43:35.130
- Tell him to go fuck himself.
- I'll tell him after the game.

43:35.154 --> 43:36.154
Bullshit!

43:36.739 --> 43:37.854
God damn it!

43:38.533 --> 43:39.818
Box out. Box out.

43:40.034 --> 43:40.944
Let's go, y'all.

43:41.035 --> 43:43.447
Box out.

43:46.999 --> 43:48.894
Come on, fellas.
Hey, let's box this out.

43:48.918 --> 43:49.918
Rebound!

43:50.753 --> 43:51.788
Come on, Hayes!

43:52.130 --> 43:53.586
Time-out! Time-out!

43:54.048 --> 43:55.818
Sal, time-out. God damn it.

43:55.842 --> 43:56.842
Time-out.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.424
Full time-out here.
Full time-out here.

44:00.054 --> 44:01.339
God damn, man.

44:03.766 --> 44:04.926
Bring it in. Sit down.

44:06.352 --> 44:09.264
All right. Come on, guys.
Let's go. Let's win this fucking game.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.937
We've got 15 seconds left.
We're gonna go on 8.

44:12.024 --> 44:13.980
Gives us time for a rebound or a tip-in.

44:14.068 --> 44:16.901
Brandon, 20's gonna pick you up
full court. All right?

44:16.988 --> 44:19.133
Freeze, you're gonna come up
and set a ball screen for Brandon.

44:19.157 --> 44:20.634
Brandon, you roll around to the right.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.819
Garcia, come up,
set a back screen for Kenny.

44:23.244 --> 44:24.950
Kenny, come out to the wing
for the three.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.277
That way we got three options.

44:26.372 --> 44:29.830
Brandon attacking right will look
for freeze coming off the screen.

44:30.001 --> 44:31.562
- Watch the clock! Watch the clock!
- If neither of those are there,

44:31.586 --> 44:32.980
go to Kenny for the three in the corner.

44:33.004 --> 44:33.868
You got this, okay?

44:33.963 --> 44:36.170
No, don't just nod.
I wanna hear your voice. Yes or no?

44:36.257 --> 44:37.359
Yes, coach.

44:37.383 --> 44:38.919
Set it, set it, set it!

44:40.303 --> 44:41.338
That's you, b!

44:41.679 --> 44:43.044
Go, Brandon!

44:43.139 --> 44:44.979
Watch the clock!
Watch the clock!

44:51.022 --> 44:52.102
We won!

45:10.124 --> 45:11.239
Brandon, you need a ride?

45:12.418 --> 45:13.624
No, I'm good, coach.

45:13.711 --> 45:14.711
Where do you live?

45:15.755 --> 45:16.995
Uh, los codona ave.

45:17.340 --> 45:18.375
Come on, get in the car.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.096
You walk home alone every night?

45:28.851 --> 45:29.851
Mmm-hmm.

45:30.686 --> 45:31.892
Where's mom or dad?

45:33.147 --> 45:34.603
My mom died three years ago

45:34.690 --> 45:36.521
and my dad's at home
with my little brothers.

45:37.902 --> 45:39.733
That's why he didn't come
to any of the games?

45:40.947 --> 45:41.947
Yeanh.

45:42.531 --> 45:44.112
You played a hell of a game tonight.

45:45.534 --> 45:46.899
Next time, shoot the ball.

45:49.664 --> 45:50.779
On the last play?

45:50.957 --> 45:52.913
That's your shot, not Kenny's.

45:54.919 --> 45:57.831
Yeah, the defense collapsed on me,
so Kenny was open in the corner.

45:58.381 --> 45:59.381
Right.

46:00.049 --> 46:01.585
So that was a smart play.

46:02.551 --> 46:05.042
Sometimes a smart play
is not the right play.

46:06.097 --> 46:07.553
You're the best player on the team.

46:08.307 --> 46:10.298
The game's on the line,
100 times out of 100

46:10.393 --> 46:11.513
I want you taking that shot.

46:13.938 --> 46:15.519
Why is that so hard for you to believe?

46:16.482 --> 46:17.312
What?

46:17.400 --> 46:19.015
That you're the best player on the team.

46:19.735 --> 46:21.771
You understand this game in a way
these guys don't.

46:23.197 --> 46:24.858
I saw you get frustrated at chubbs

46:24.949 --> 46:26.814
when he didn't go backdoor
on the ball reverse.

46:26.909 --> 46:29.616
Or freeze, when he didn't duck under
on the Atlanta set.

46:31.747 --> 46:34.113
Why didn't you call him out
for not making the right play?

46:36.502 --> 46:38.538
Uh, it's not really my thing
to call someone out.

46:39.672 --> 46:41.708
I'm not, like,
the team captain or nothing, so...

46:42.341 --> 46:43.706
So, if I make you the captain,

46:43.801 --> 46:46.087
are you gonna chew chubbs out
when he doesn't go backdoor?

46:50.391 --> 46:51.391
Yes or no?

46:56.439 --> 46:57.999
I'm just up here on the left.

47:06.407 --> 47:07.407
Night, coach.

47:16.876 --> 47:17.876
Hey, son.

47:18.377 --> 47:19.377
Who that?

47:19.545 --> 47:20.751
That's my new coach.

47:20.880 --> 47:22.566
All right.
Go on, get with that homework.

47:22.590 --> 47:23.590
Yes, sir.

47:39.190 --> 47:40.250
Atlanta high, Atlanta high.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.265
Stop, stop, stop. Reset.

47:42.360 --> 47:44.521
- What set are we in, Brandon?
- Atlanta high.

47:44.612 --> 47:46.398
- Did you call it out?
- Yeah.

47:46.489 --> 47:47.758
- Did you guys hear him?
- Nah.

47:47.782 --> 47:49.343
We're in an empty gym,
and nobody heard you.

47:49.367 --> 47:50.367
Do it again.

47:50.534 --> 47:52.262
Atlanta high. Atlanta high.

47:52.286 --> 47:53.286
Reset.

47:54.580 --> 47:56.616
Brandon, I still can't hear you.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.072
You're gonna be our point guard,

47:58.167 --> 48:00.658
people need to be able to hear
what you say on the floor.

48:00.753 --> 48:02.313
You hear how loud I'm talking
right now?

48:02.380 --> 48:03.380
Yeanh.

48:03.589 --> 48:05.545
- That's how loud you need to be.
- All right.

48:05.633 --> 48:07.235
You can do it, b.
Come on, Brandon.

48:07.259 --> 48:08.795
I can't hear you, Brandon.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.673
Come on, break that press.
B, break that press.

48:11.764 --> 48:12.764
Call it out.

48:14.934 --> 48:16.720
Brandon, I can't hear you.

48:16.811 --> 48:18.288
Yo, are you fucking serious?
Get off me!

48:18.312 --> 48:20.803
There's 3,000 people at memorial
screaming their heads off,

48:20.898 --> 48:22.479
and I don't know what set we're in!

48:22.566 --> 48:23.566
Fuck you!

48:24.902 --> 48:26.062
Can you hear me now?

48:27.780 --> 48:28.780
Can you?

48:30.616 --> 48:32.277
Yeah, I can hear you now.

48:56.767 --> 48:57.807
What's up, coach?

48:57.893 --> 48:59.008
How'd you find my house?

48:59.437 --> 49:00.597
I looked you up on my phone.

49:00.729 --> 49:01.729
Oh.

49:03.941 --> 49:04.941
What do you want?

49:05.025 --> 49:08.517
Uh... so my momma,
she works till 7:00 every night.

49:09.196 --> 49:10.590
And she was like,
she doesn't want me really

49:10.614 --> 49:12.024
being out on my own after school.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.653
So she was wondering maybe
if you'll let me back on the team.

49:15.870 --> 49:18.110
I already told you, Marcus.
I don't want you on the team.

49:19.290 --> 49:21.601
If it's about finding something to do
after school, I'll talk to coach Dan.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.865
We can set you up with study hall
or something like that.

49:24.253 --> 49:25.743
All right? Sorry.

49:51.155 --> 49:53.020
I thought that was a pretty fair offer,
Marcus.

49:56.535 --> 49:57.991
My momma ain't sent me here, coach.

49:59.246 --> 50:00.736
I'm here 'cause I wanna play ball.

50:03.125 --> 50:04.125
I miss it.

50:05.461 --> 50:07.292
I don't fucking like
nothing else, coach.

50:08.506 --> 50:09.506
Don't swear.

50:10.216 --> 50:12.027
There's a code of conduct policy
at the school.

50:12.051 --> 50:13.837
- You know that?
- My bad.

50:13.928 --> 50:16.670
There's a big section in there
about swearing.

50:18.933 --> 50:20.173
I'm sorry. I won't swear.

50:31.320 --> 50:32.685
Be at practice tomorrow at 4:00.

50:33.280 --> 50:34.986
- You serious?
- Don't be late.

50:35.241 --> 50:36.401
Ah, fuck no... l mean heck.

50:36.492 --> 50:38.733
I'm sorry.
Heck no, I'm not gonna be late.

50:39.537 --> 50:41.118
I'm sorry about cursing, coach.

50:47.378 --> 50:48.538
Let's go. Bring it in.

50:50.130 --> 50:51.890
- Oh, my gosh.
- It wasn't me.

50:55.302 --> 50:56.963
A few things before we get started.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.296
As you can see,
Marcus is rejoining the team.

51:01.767 --> 51:02.973
Judging by that reaction,

51:03.310 --> 51:05.642
I expect it'll be some time
before he regains your respect.

51:06.605 --> 51:07.605
Second thing is...

51:08.440 --> 51:09.555
Sam and I discussed...

51:10.234 --> 51:12.065
We're gonna make a change
to the captain spot.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.903
Brandon, you're gonna be our captain
going forward.

51:16.865 --> 51:18.025
That's it. Get to work.

51:18.534 --> 51:20.053
All right, fellas.
Let's go. Let's work.

51:20.077 --> 51:21.477
Let's hustle up. Let's do it.

51:21.579 --> 51:24.070
Good shit, b.
I'll follow your lead. Come on.

51:27.751 --> 51:29.145
Every time that ball goes
through the hoop,

51:29.169 --> 51:30.438
I'm gonna be thinking about you.

51:30.462 --> 51:31.872
- You know that?
- Yeah.

51:31.964 --> 51:32.964
Yo, let's go.

51:34.758 --> 51:36.294
A'ight. I'll see you after.
Okay?

51:36.594 --> 51:37.594
Bye, Kenny.

51:41.807 --> 51:44.093
All right, let's go. Move.

51:45.102 --> 51:46.933
What did we discover last night
at baptist?

51:47.021 --> 51:48.511
That defense creates offense.

51:48.606 --> 51:49.958
We have to maintain pressure
for all four quarters.

51:49.982 --> 51:50.846
- That's right.
- All right.

51:50.941 --> 51:52.294
Discovered that
we're a pressing team.

51:52.318 --> 51:54.438
We don't take any plays off,
we don't let 'em breathe.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.856
As soon as they get over half-court,
we trap.

51:56.947 --> 51:58.812
Even if the ball's
in the middle of the court?

51:58.907 --> 52:00.022
Anywhere and everywhere.

52:00.117 --> 52:01.928
You can't trap if the ball's
in the middle of the floor.

52:01.952 --> 52:02.782
You need the sideline.

52:02.870 --> 52:04.451
Who says?
We can do whatever we want.

52:04.538 --> 52:05.368
Get up!

52:05.456 --> 52:07.225
There you go. There you go.
Stay with him!

52:07.249 --> 52:09.240
Pressure, pressure.
Don't let him breathe.

52:09.335 --> 52:10.854
- There you go.
- Trap, trap, trap!

52:10.878 --> 52:12.368
Bring it around. Stay on him.

52:12.755 --> 52:14.916
No! Bullshit!

52:15.257 --> 52:17.122
That's a chickenshit fucking call.

52:17.217 --> 52:18.217
God damn it!

52:20.763 --> 52:22.628
I'm working on it. âWork harder.

52:23.515 --> 52:24.515
Come on!

52:30.522 --> 52:32.122
If we're gonna
keep winning games,

52:32.191 --> 52:34.307
we gotta make our lack of size
an advantage.

52:34.818 --> 52:35.682
We gotta speed the game up.

52:35.778 --> 52:37.618
We gotta play every possession
like it's a war.

52:37.696 --> 52:40.904
Come on! You've gotta be fucking blind!
That's a horseshit call!

52:43.786 --> 52:44.992
We done yet, coach?

52:45.079 --> 52:47.240
We're a pressing team.
It's not even the third quarter.

52:47.331 --> 52:48.161
We're just getting warmed up.

52:48.248 --> 52:49.613
Motion, motion.

52:51.585 --> 52:53.505
What did we discover last night
at downey?

52:53.545 --> 52:54.375
We gotta take charges.

52:54.463 --> 52:55.774
We gotta play with chips
on our shoulders.

52:55.798 --> 52:58.460
Play with a chip
on your fucking shoulder. Goddamn right.

52:58.550 --> 53:00.916
Marcus.
Come on, you're going in for chubbs.

53:01.345 --> 53:03.210
Marcus, I want you
to cover the inbound, okay?

53:03.305 --> 53:05.091
Big arms.
Force him to pass into the corner.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.012
That's it!

53:06.100 --> 53:06.930
The little things add up.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.803
Let's do all the little things right.

53:08.894 --> 53:12.557
Loose ball gets us two points.
Tip pass gets us to four.

53:12.648 --> 53:14.513
Steal gets us another two.
Now we're at six.

53:14.608 --> 53:16.769
Turnover out of our press gets us
to eight.

53:16.860 --> 53:18.020
All this shit adds up.

53:18.696 --> 53:22.359
Every box-out, every hustle,
every loose ball, every trap.

53:22.449 --> 53:23.529
Put all that shit together,

53:23.575 --> 53:25.053
all of a sudden
we're pretty fucking tough to beat.

53:25.077 --> 53:26.077
Hit that!

53:31.250 --> 53:33.616
- That's how we do it.
- Got that candy-stroke.

53:33.711 --> 53:35.167
What quarter are we in, coach?

53:35.713 --> 53:36.753
The fourth quarter.

53:37.005 --> 53:39.747
The other team's gassed.
Let's see what we got left in the tank.

53:40.968 --> 53:43.880
Hayes, let's go!
Bishop Hayes, let's go!

53:44.972 --> 53:46.928
Hayes, let's go!

53:47.015 --> 53:48.926
Bishop Hayes, let's go!

53:49.017 --> 53:50.017
Kenny.

53:52.396 --> 53:54.637
Coach, why you gotta do me
like that, man?

53:55.691 --> 53:56.806
Good luck tonight, Kenny.

54:03.449 --> 54:04.939
What quarter are we in, coach?

54:05.033 --> 54:07.649
Holy shit, look at that.
We just went into overtime.

54:15.836 --> 54:17.876
What did we learn
about ourselves last night?

54:17.921 --> 54:19.601
That we have
to respect the game.

54:20.299 --> 54:21.299
That's right.

54:22.009 --> 54:23.009
Respect.

54:27.222 --> 54:29.713
Yo, coach, how many more I got?

54:30.934 --> 54:32.674
Well, Kenny, it's not up to me.

54:33.353 --> 54:35.039
- Let's keep him moving.
- Come on.

54:35.063 --> 54:37.103
Hey, y'all.
How y'all gonna do me like that?

54:37.191 --> 54:38.897
I loved each and every one of you girls.

54:38.984 --> 54:40.628
Bye, Kenny.

54:40.652 --> 54:42.255
- Hayley, you know I...
- No, keep going.

54:42.279 --> 54:43.423
Girls, you're all in my heart.

54:43.447 --> 54:45.341
- You each have your own little section.
- Hurry up!

54:45.365 --> 54:46.980
I'm going!

54:48.452 --> 54:50.033
Bye, Kenny.

55:18.398 --> 55:19.228
Hey.

55:19.316 --> 55:20.351
Hey.

55:22.903 --> 55:23.903
Ready?

55:36.500 --> 55:38.411
- Hi.
- Angela!

55:38.502 --> 55:40.242
- Hi.
- Oh, my goodness.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.953
So, the doctors are optimistic?

55:43.924 --> 55:44.959
So far, so good.

55:45.592 --> 55:46.592
Great.

55:48.971 --> 55:52.463
They told us, "let him do all the things
any normal kid would do."

55:55.143 --> 55:57.008
- But you know what remission's like.
- Yeah.

55:57.104 --> 56:00.221
Living life waiting on pins and needles
for the other shoe to drop.

56:02.109 --> 56:03.920
Spoke to Ethan lately?

56:03.944 --> 56:06.624
He called me a couple of times.
I haven't gotten back to him.

56:08.198 --> 56:09.529
Andrew's not looking so good.

56:10.075 --> 56:12.612
And now they're, uh,
talking about hospice.

56:14.788 --> 56:15.788
Jesus.

56:16.039 --> 56:17.620
Can I use a different bat, dad?

56:17.958 --> 56:20.918
Pick any bat you want, son.
But first say hello to Mr. Cunningham.

56:21.086 --> 56:23.022
- Hi, Mr. Cunningham.
- Hey, how you doing, pal?

56:23.046 --> 56:24.536
Michael's dad.

56:25.632 --> 56:26.632
You remember Michael.

56:27.384 --> 56:28.653
Remember, we were in the hospital.

56:28.677 --> 56:29.904
- It's all right.
- Halloween, we...

56:29.928 --> 56:31.634
No, no, no.
We put you two in a wheelchair

56:31.722 --> 56:33.366
and then we pushed you all
around the hospital

56:33.390 --> 56:34.971
- collecting candy.
- Mmm-hmm

56:35.142 --> 56:36.828
- doctor was gonna kill you for that.
- Yeah.

56:36.852 --> 56:37.762
That was your idea.

56:37.853 --> 56:40.344
- Michael was Dracula.
- That's right. He was Dracula.

56:40.439 --> 56:41.541
Who's ready
to sing happy birthday?

56:41.565 --> 56:44.432
- All right, buddy. Let's do this.
- Who wants cake? Whoo!

56:44.526 --> 56:46.766
- Cake, cake, cake.
- It's cake time.

56:47.613 --> 56:48.944
Come on, son, let's go.

56:50.157 --> 56:52.739
Cake, cake, cake.

56:52.826 --> 56:54.862
Cake, cake, cake.

56:54.953 --> 56:57.239
Cake, cake, cake.

57:00.667 --> 57:04.831
Happy birthday to you

57:05.380 --> 57:10.044
happy birthday, dear David

57:11.178 --> 57:14.796
happy birthday to you

57:41.667 --> 57:43.282
Hi, Michael.

57:44.753 --> 57:46.618
Please, lord, look after my son.

57:48.173 --> 57:49.288
Please let him be happy.

58:16.952 --> 58:17.952
I miss you, pal.

58:59.911 --> 59:01.511
Thanks for coming to the party.

59:05.500 --> 59:08.287
I know Miguel and Sofia invite us
'cause they don't want us to feel...

59:09.463 --> 59:10.669
Excluded,

59:11.048 --> 59:12.834
but I just end up feeling like...

59:14.342 --> 59:15.752
Even more of an outcast.

59:17.220 --> 59:19.051
It's like I just get angry
all over again.

59:20.766 --> 59:23.599
Look around at all the boys,
and wish it was one of them...

59:24.770 --> 59:25.885
Not Michael.

59:28.356 --> 59:29.892
Does that make me an awful person?

59:33.028 --> 59:34.518
I never stop being angry.

59:44.414 --> 59:45.779
I know you're suffering.

59:48.335 --> 59:51.498
Yeah, I'm suffering.

59:54.216 --> 59:55.376
And I miss my son.

59:58.637 --> 01:00:00.548
And I don't believe
he's in a better place.

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:06.016
I believe the best place for him
was right here with you and me.

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:11.232
Yeanh.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:12.942
Home.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.312
We're both suffering.

01:00:16.488 --> 01:00:18.528
I don't know, ang,
you seem to be doing pretty good.

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:20.407
A new job...

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:24.034
Fucking some rich guy
while we're still married.

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:36.966
Sorry.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.311
You could go to the library.

01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:10.989
- The library? Really?
- Yep.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.244
Would you go with me?

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.480
- Well...
- Well, it's for senior women.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:16.335
For heaven's sakes, Kurt.

01:01:16.423 --> 01:01:18.505
I don't have a problem making friends.

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:20.833
I don't.
But it's just, it's a whole new place.

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.009
I've only been there a little while.
Give me...

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:24.407
Well, it's called
a two-way street, though.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:25.261
You gotta get out a little.

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.428
Uh...

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:30.508
You think maybe it's time
for a new shower curtain, Jack?

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:32.560
No, I hadn't thought about it.

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:34.763
Well, you should,
'cause that thing smells.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.515
Anybody want a drink?

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:37.920
- No. No.
- I'm good.

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:40.777
So, what does the scout report
look like for the team today, Jack?

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.651
Uh, well,
they're struggling a little bit.

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:45.733
Trinity has lost six in a row.

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:50.116
They have one good shooter, tj edmonds,
but uncle Jack's team should win.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:51.617
And they kinda have to win.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:53.289
'Cause if they don't win tonight,

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:57.165
their next chance at getting
into the playoffs is against memorial.

01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:59.796
And memorial's the number one
ranked team in the state.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.110
You should see him, Jack.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:02.695
Every morning,
the night after your game,

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:05.489
he wakes up early, he goes downstairs,
checks the stats on the computer.

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:07.313
Maybe I should be
the assistant coach tonight.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:12.093
Number 41.
Get your head in the fucking game.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:13.302
Come on, Brandon. Let's go!

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.016
Push up!

01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:17.107
Defense!

01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:19.399
All right.
Motion, motion, motion.

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:21.143
Don't stop.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:24.066
41's the shooter.
Watch the drop screen.

01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:32.032
Push it up. Let's go!

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:34.917
Look out.

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:36.453
Kenny!

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.940
Playing with their heads up
their fucking ass.

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:40.704
They're just really nervous right now.

01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:43.665
These guys have never played a game
that's ever mattered.

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:45.671
One stop. No threes.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.424
Shit.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:54.872
- Switch up, switch up.
- Defense!

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:56.852
- Move! Move!
- Defense!

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.101
Here we go, here we go! Go!

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:02.647
Come on, Kenny! That's stupid.
It's the back court!

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:04.728
- I know.
- Yo, commit to the top.

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:07.051
- We had an open player. Let's go!
- All right, all right. I know.

01:03:07.075 --> 01:03:07.939
221221

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:09.914
- watch the screen!
- No threes!

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:14.078
- Any time-outs?
- None.

01:03:14.165 --> 01:03:15.280
Push it, push it!

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:17.376
Hayes, look up.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.337
Oh, that's bullshit.

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:24.756
What's the call, sal?

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:27.504
Offensive foul, number 23.

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:29.195
That's bullshit. He was moving his feet!

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:30.741
- Offensive, number 23.
- He was moving his feet.

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:31.675
He was already set, Jack.

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:34.098
You don't make that fucking call
at the end of the game!

01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:35.997
- It's the end of the game!
- His feet were set, Jack!

01:03:36.021 --> 01:03:37.761
It's a chickenshit call.

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:39.959
- Come on. That's a pussy call.
- Listen, that's a warning.

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.252
And you're a fucking pussy
for making it.

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:42.140
All right, you know what?
That's it.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.065
Fuck you.

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:45.273
- Hey, Jack. Jack!
- Technical foul, right here.

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:47.779
You don't fucking decide the game! Okay?

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:49.527
The players decide the fucking game.

01:03:49.617 --> 01:03:51.699
- That's bullshit.
- Jack, Jack, Jack.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:53.222
You don't fucking do that now!

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.141
The players decide the goddamn game!

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:57.281
- Hey!
- You've gotta calm down.

01:03:57.375 --> 01:03:59.206
Technical foul. You're outta here.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:02.039
Na na na na

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.917
na na na na hey hey, goodbye

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.123
take a breath.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:11.170
Na na na na na na na na

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:14.597
hey hey, goodbye

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.527
Sorry for losing my temper tonight.

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:35.451
I shouldn't have done that.

01:04:40.085 --> 01:04:41.700
You know what my dad told me last night?

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:44.581
He said that you got a full ride
to Kansas...

01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:47.873
And that you just quit.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.052
No reason.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:55.891
Why?

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:07.483
My father didn't like me very much.

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:12.278
And then someone told him
I was good at basketball...

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:15.154
And he paid a lot more attention to me.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:19.993
And the better I got,
the more love he showed me.

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:24.292
Then I realized it wasn't me
that he loved...

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:27.746
It was what I could do.

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:33.760
So, you just quit playing
as a "fuck you" to your dad?

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:38.180
Yeah, I guess so.

01:05:39.811 --> 01:05:41.517
I made a lot of bad decisions, Brandon.

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:43.063
I got a lot of regret.

01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:45.726
Went away from basketball,

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:47.978
got into a different life,
got into drugs.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:53.397
Spent a lot of time hurting myself,
trying to hurt my father.

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:03.948
It was my wife who got me outta that.

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:13.458
I never picked up a basketball again.

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:28.473
Yeah, go ahead and lower it in.

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:31.730
Russ! Yo, Russ!

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:33.405
You got a visitor.

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.484
Yo! Dump that. Dump it!

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.530
- Let's go! All right. Back.
- Excuse me, are you Russ durrett?

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:40.610
Yeah, can I help you?

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:43.184
Yeah, I'm Jack Cunningham.
I coach your son over at bishop Hayes.

01:06:43.208 --> 01:06:44.914
Get this tuna on the scale now.

01:06:45.293 --> 01:06:47.249
Yeah, man, I know who you are.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.286
Yeah, I used to come watch you play
down at cheviot hills.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.914
You and Benny green and yaya Davis.

01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:56.255
Yeah, man. Yaya and Benny, man,
we used to do our thing.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:57.679
So, how can I help you?

01:06:58.306 --> 01:07:00.159
Well, I want to talk to you
about Brandon.

01:07:00.183 --> 01:07:02.845
Has he shown you any of the
recruiting letters he's been getting?

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.176
Brandon ain't shown me nothing.

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:07.391
Well, he's getting a lot of attention
from good schools

01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:09.097
that want him to come play ball for 'em.

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:11.103
Thanks for coming by here
and letting me know...

01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:12.569
Coach.

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:16.300
How come we don't see you
down at any of the games?

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:17.939
'Cause I got responsibilities at home.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:21.026
I got two boys that need to be bathed,
fed, and helped with their homework.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.781
Well, we got a big game
this week.

01:07:23.122 --> 01:07:24.612
If we win it, we go to the playoffs.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.033
Listen, I don't come to any games

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:31.164
'cause I don't support my son's ideas
about the game, okay?

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:34.167
I don't want him relying on basketball
to make a life.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:36.966
That was my mistake
and it ain't gonna be his.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.615
These schools are offering him
full scholarships.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.175
Oh, come on, man. It don't matter.

01:07:41.849 --> 01:07:43.089
They offered me the same.

01:07:43.685 --> 01:07:45.971
Putting your faith in basketball,
it don't work out.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:48.102
And if anybody ought to know that,
it oughta be you.

01:07:50.984 --> 01:07:51.984
Yeanh.

01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:56.736
Your son loves the game.
He's gonna keep playing it.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:09.700
Let's do this!

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.538
Let's go, bishop! Whoo! Let's go!

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:17.214
It's the tigers, baby!
Let's do this, Hayes!

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:42.319
Um... so, are we gonna stay in the press
the whole game or...

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.024
Yep, right from the tip.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:47.991
Okay. I'd better get the lineup out
to the scores table.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
And, uh...

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:53.417
I know nobody expected us to be here,

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:55.665
and we got no business winning
this game,

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:58.464
but I really want to beat
these fucking guys.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:24.194
Come on, coach Cunningham!

01:09:25.536 --> 01:09:27.242
We love you, coach!

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:36.453
- All right.
- Let's fly.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:41.593
Coach.

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:47.008
Let's go. Bring it in.

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:55.438
All right. We're on diamond press
right from the tip.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:58.688
Keep that pressure up.
They break it, fall back into 22.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.400
Look, you're nervous.

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:05.325
I get that.

01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:08.610
The truth is, they got more talent
over there than we do.

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:10.867
Probably got a better coach.

01:10:11.582 --> 01:10:12.446
Nah.

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.579
But I promise you,
they are not a better team.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.961
I would take anyone on this bench
right now,

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.754
for any one of those players.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.712
You worked hard to be here,
you earned this.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.543
Have some fun out there.

01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:27.157
Now go out there and earn the playoffs.

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:28.181
All right, do it!

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:31.428
Win on three. One, two, three...

01:10:31.519 --> 01:10:32.519
Win!

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:45.609
Up! Up!

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:47.782
- Get your man.
- Hands up, hands up!

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:52.533
Gonna eat us alive, if we give
that shot. Push him to his left.

01:10:52.623 --> 01:10:53.851
Atlanta high, Atlanta high.

01:10:53.875 --> 01:10:55.477
Quick, quick!
Switch, switch, switch!

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:57.746
Get back, get back!

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.415
That's it.

01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:04.582
Box out! Watch it! Watch it!

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:06.511
Rebound!

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:09.545
Switch up.
Come down, come down, come down!

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.410
- Corner, corner, corner.
- Hey!

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:12.549
Go, go, go!

01:11:20.485 --> 01:11:21.485
Help out!

01:11:26.073 --> 01:11:27.468
Time-out, time-out.

01:11:27.492 --> 01:11:29.653
Get up and yell "bishop!"

01:11:29.744 --> 01:11:30.574
We need stops.

01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:33.778
So let's double-team childress
every time he comes across half-court.

01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:35.704
Make somebody else fucking score.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:38.249
Stay on him! Press!
Pressure! Don't give up!

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:39.336
Watch the pick.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.482
Pick left.
Switch off to the side.

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:42.586
Go! Let's go.

01:11:42.673 --> 01:11:43.673
Throw it in!

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:47.588
That's it! That's it!
Here we go, here we go.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:52.468
- Put it in there.
- Go on, go on!

01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:54.924
You guys gotta move.
You can't stand around.

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:56.939
Switch, switch,
switch, switch, switch.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.460
Let's go. Bring it through.

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:03.644
- Here we go!
- Pick him up. Pick him up.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:06.482
Look, we're not gonna make it all back
in one possession.

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:08.984
You gotta just keep chipping away,
and chipping away at it.

01:12:09.075 --> 01:12:10.177
Watch him, watch him.
Down the rail.

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:11.762
- Up!
- Come on. Come on.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:13.447
Little things, do the little things.

01:12:13.538 --> 01:12:14.778
Take it to the rack.

01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:15.933
That's you.

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:17.618
Let's go, baby. Let's go, huh!

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:19.039
Let's go, son.

01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:20.161
Yeah!

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:24.750
There you go.
All right. Up, up, up!

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.276
- D-up, d-up.
- Let's go.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.402
Get your man, get your man.

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:29.238
Get up in their faces.
Get in their face.

01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:30.948
Bobby, Bobby, watch this guy.
Watch this...

01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:31.802
Let's get a trap!

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:32.889
Pass it.

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:35.970
Yeah! There you go!

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.302
Too easy. That's too easy.

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:40.978
Switch, switch. Get through it.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:43.688
Motion, motion.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:44.920
Here you go,
here you go, here you go.

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:46.171
Hey, coming through,
coming through.

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:48.257
Pick left, pick left.
Go through, go through.

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:50.647
Nice pass.

01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:52.094
Time-out! Time-out.

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:54.484
Keep pressing, trapping, taking charges.

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:56.410
Make our lack of size an advantage.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:58.892
Play like we've got a fucking chip
on our shoulders. Let's go!

01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:00.372
Go, go, go. Lock up.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:02.437
Offensive!

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:03.541
- Offensive.
- Yeah!

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:04.789
Come on!

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.543
Jesus, you guys.
We're playing right into their hands.

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:10.466
Move the ball. Move the ball.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:11.553
Let's go!

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:15.551
Diamond, diamond, diamond!

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:19.429
Zach, he's six inches shorter than you.
How does he make that shot?

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.556
Chips on our fucking shoulders.
Let's go!

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:22.686
That!

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:25.105
- Defense!
- Stay on your man.

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.024
That's it. Beautiful.

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:29.773
I don't even know who I'm looking at.

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:30.864
Go, go, go.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:33.802
Out!

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:36.146
- Ran out. You ran out.
- Get him, get him.

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:39.182
- Hey, diamond! Diamond!
- D-up!

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:41.413
- Pressure!
- Come on, break through.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.060
- Pressure!
- Reach. Shoot.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.412
Attack this. Attack their pressure!

01:13:48.883 --> 01:13:52.592
Switch, switch, switch.
Come on! Box out.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:54.815
Twenty-two.
Plot it out! Plot it out!

01:13:58.225 --> 01:14:01.388
That's it, that's it,
that's it. That's it!

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:03.094
Yeah, that's a great call.

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:05.417
- That is a bullshit call.
- How many time-outs do we have?

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.477
- One time-out left.
- His hands were all over 'em.

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.168
- It's a home job.
- All right. Time-out!

01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:11.196
Time-out.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:13.377
All right.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.471
- What's up? Say something.
- Hey, hey, hey. Chill. Chill.

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:18.722
- Bring it in.
- Chill, man. Come on.

01:14:18.746 --> 01:14:21.308
- What're you gonna do?
- I'm gonna run Atlanta for Brandon.

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:24.495
But childress is on him.
You gotta expect a double-team.

01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:26.121
So, is he gonna get an open look?

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:27.545
Yeah.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:32.335
All right. 12 seconds, no time-outs.

01:14:33.594 --> 01:14:35.084
We're gonna run the hawk for Kenny.

01:14:35.846 --> 01:14:37.256
Marcus, set the high pick.

01:14:37.348 --> 01:14:39.304
Freeze, Garcia, come round,
set a double screen.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:41.383
Brandon, go right,
look for Kenny on the wing.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:42.967
Three, we're stopping three.

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:44.973
He gets the ball,
he doesn't go five feet.

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:46.395
We lock him up. One stop.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:48.210
Stay focused, run our set.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:49.519
Get out there and win this.

01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:53.632
- Team on three.
- Win on three.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:54.566
One, two, three...

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.989
- Win!
- Let's go, man! Let's do this.

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:01.746
Brandon...

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:03.908
Forget that. Take the shot.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.199
Don't nod your head at me.

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:07.502
I got this.

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:22.697
Hello?

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:24.113
Hey, it's me.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:25.950
Hey.

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:29.194
I just got off the phone
with Miguel, and...

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:31.706
What?

01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:58.851
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:04.320
What happened? A few weeks ago,
he was hitting baseballs.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:07.068
Yeah, he, um...
He had a fever at school.

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:10.363
Sofia picked him up,
and then he just started seizing.

01:19:12.957 --> 01:19:13.957
Is he conscious?

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:15.833
He's sedated.

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:24.175
Is he, uh...

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:26.042
Gonna be okay, or...

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:27.136
They don't know.

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:31.338
They did a scan this morning,
they're just waiting on results now.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:46.687
No!

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:50.032
No! Nol

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:53.326
what do you mean? No!

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:07.921
I can't. I... I gotta go.

01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:10.612
- Just wait. Where are you going?
- I gotta go. I gotta go.

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.116
Come on. Come on.

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:01.911
Just a few more.

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:05.326
You should see my moves.
They're better than my old man.

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:08.037
Your old man didn't have moves.

01:22:08.465 --> 01:22:10.126
I used to carry him up the stairs.

01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:12.500
Got the key? Huh?

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:14.092
Let's go.

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:15.885
No. No, no, no.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:17.932
Give it here.

01:22:19.810 --> 01:22:20.810
There you go.

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:44.394
- Look at Marcus!
- Come on, man, I'm right here!

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:46.079
Let's see the ball move, okay?

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:49.003
- Double back to me.
- Go, go, go!

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:50.538
Snap it back through!

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:52.884
Nice, Sam.

01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:56.865
Call 'em out! Call 'em out!

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.200
Get through, get through.

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:38.501
- Come on, get through, get through.
- Nice, Kenny.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.537
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:23:44.978 --> 01:23:46.343
- Hey, Jack.
- Coach.

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.832
Are you all right?
Where you been?

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:50.598
Yeah. Had a power outage in my, uh...

01:23:51.527 --> 01:23:52.527
Neighborhood.

01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:54.397
Alarm didn't go off so...

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:57.025
I overslept. I apologize.

01:23:57.491 --> 01:23:58.491
Bring it in.

01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:03.986
I had a power situation at my place.

01:24:04.081 --> 01:24:06.572
I overslept. That's on me, okay?

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:09.207
Let's get into a hawk set.

01:24:09.795 --> 01:24:12.958
Brandon, take the ball.
Kenny and Garcia on the wing.

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:14.629
Marcus and freeze, start in the box.

01:24:59.595 --> 01:25:00.595
Yeah.

01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:05.590
Hey, padre. How's it going?

01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:07.018
How are you, Jack?

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:09.806
I'm all right. What can I do for ya?

01:25:12.316 --> 01:25:14.002
Jack, I'm afraid
we're gonna have to ask you

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:15.937
to step down from coaching the team.

01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:21.699
Why?

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:25.283
It's come to my attention

01:25:25.370 --> 01:25:27.702
that you've brought alcohol
around the players.

01:25:28.624 --> 01:25:29.909
We're gonna have to let you go.

01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:33.408
And I'm gonna need your office key.

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:37.709
I'm worried that this might be
part of a larger problem, Jack.

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.005
Would that be true?

01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:40.957
You didn't want to just come talk to me?

01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:42.697
I did come talk to you
about it, Jack,

01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:44.032
- and then you lied to me.
- I never lied to you.

01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:44.886
I didn't lie to you about anything.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.214
You lied to me today
about your alarm clock.

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:49.721
I had a power outage
at my house.

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:51.414
- You were drunk at practice.
- Oh, bullshit!

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:53.082
- I could smell it on you.
- Bullshit.

01:25:53.106 --> 01:25:54.767
The boys could smell it on you.

01:26:06.787 --> 01:26:07.787
Uh...

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:13.286
All right, look...

01:26:14.961 --> 01:26:17.703
Let's just get to the playoffs,
all right?

01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:22.632
Guys, please. Just don't do this.
Okay?

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:26.970
I just... you know, I had a bad night.
And, uh, I got it under control now

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:28.137
and I can take care of it.

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:31.217
Let's just, please...
I'm asking you, please, okay?

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:33.677
I'm sorry.
Please, don't do it, do this.

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:37.890
Jack, you've made this decision for me.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.106
I can't accept responsibility

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:44.859
for allowing you to be
around the boys anymore.

01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:05.010
You know...

01:27:05.262 --> 01:27:06.593
Fine.

01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:10.589
Look, please, just...

01:27:12.602 --> 01:27:13.842
Please, don't do this.

01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:15.802
Our decision is final, Jack.

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.762
We have a zero-tolerance policy

01:27:17.858 --> 01:27:19.578
- when it comes to alcohol.
- Fine. Fuck it.

01:27:19.943 --> 01:27:21.729
I tried to do something good
with these kids.

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:24.812
You know...

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:25.986
It's your choice.

01:27:27.117 --> 01:27:30.951
Who's gonna coach the team?
You? You're a fucking math teacher.

01:27:31.288 --> 01:27:33.370
I came to help you out.
Look what we did.

01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:37.158
Tried to come in here and help you.
You asked for my help.

01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:41.128
And I tried to help you.
This is such bullshit.

01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:43.622
I can't get this fucking...
I don't need this job.

01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:45.069
We are trying to help, Jack.

01:27:45.093 --> 01:27:46.733
You know what? Stick...

01:29:01.378 --> 01:29:02.378
What's this?

01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:05.086
From the blonde in the corner.

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:07.130
Says she knows you.

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:36.151
Another one from the blonde
in the corner.

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:38.911
Only this time
it comes with a message,

01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:43.208
"stop being a jerk-off
and come over and talk to me."

01:29:46.089 --> 01:29:48.421
I think it's one of the Pearson girls
from Saint Dorothy's.

01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:51.841
Yeah, I think it's Diane.

01:30:00.937 --> 01:30:01.847
I paid for you.

01:30:01.938 --> 01:30:03.978
- I paid for the whole bar.
- You didn't pay for me.

01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:06.101
I mean, if everybody...

01:30:06.443 --> 01:30:08.650
Here, give me...
Can I have a drag of that?

01:30:08.737 --> 01:30:10.398
- Mmm.
- Please?

01:30:11.489 --> 01:30:12.489
God.

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:18.118
Thank you.
You know, I'll tell you a secret.

01:30:18.204 --> 01:30:19.284
- What?
- Give me a kiss.

01:30:19.372 --> 01:30:21.851
- No. You're driving. No. Fuck off.
- Yes, I am driving. Give me a kiss.

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:24.355
- Okay, just one. Just one. Just one.
- It's one kiss. My, god.

01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:32.632
Shit.

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:34.004
Oh, god!

01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:36.837
Oh, shit. Shit!

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:38.052
This is my neighbor's house.

01:30:38.141 --> 01:30:39.741
- What?
- You've gotta go round the back.

01:30:40.226 --> 01:30:41.495
- Hurry up! Just go round the back...
- All right.

01:30:41.519 --> 01:30:43.999
I'll meet you there.
It's the third house on the right.

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:25.476
Hello?

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:29.685
Forget to pay the electricity bill?

01:31:40.912 --> 01:31:41.947
Well...

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:48.868
I think we made it.
Think we're safe.

01:31:50.463 --> 01:31:53.330
Somebody's gonna come out
for a fucking surprise,

01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:55.840
check their mailbox in the morning,

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.005
find out their boat's fucking...

01:31:59.305 --> 01:32:00.886
Sunk.

01:32:15.113 --> 01:32:16.728
Pull your fucking pants up.

01:32:17.073 --> 01:32:18.984
My wife's calling the cops right now,
asshole.

01:32:19.075 --> 01:32:20.469
Yes, my husband's speaking
with him now.

01:32:20.493 --> 01:32:21.699
Diane's your wife?

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:23.323
Who the fuck is Diane?

01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:25.330
I don't know.

01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:27.958
Who's...

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.496
I'm in the wrong house, man.

01:32:30.587 --> 01:32:32.565
Oh, you're goddamn right,
you're in the wrong house.

01:32:32.589 --> 01:32:33.624
Look, I'm sorry.

01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:37.541
I'm real sorry.
I'm just gonna go home.

01:32:38.136 --> 01:32:40.593
Nah, you're not going anywhere.
Sit down. Wait for the cops.

01:32:41.347 --> 01:32:43.178
Come on, sit down. Sit down!

01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:45.142
Hey!

01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:47.538
Okay?

01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:55.921
Can I get you anything?

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:06.888
Did they tell you that they found you
unconscious in the street?

01:34:09.978 --> 01:34:12.594
And that you broke into someone's house?

01:34:16.192 --> 01:34:17.192
Yeanh.

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:32.288
You're gonna kill yourself
if you keep going like this.

01:34:36.296 --> 01:34:38.082
That's why I'm gonna get you
some help, okay?

01:34:42.135 --> 01:34:45.423
It has been decided that he will
no longer be with the team

01:34:46.347 --> 01:34:48.508
due to personal issues
that we'd rather not go into.

01:34:48.975 --> 01:34:52.308
I will step in as the interim coach.

01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:54.139
And I don't see why...

01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:56.250
- During our family session...
- Anything has to change.

01:34:56.274 --> 01:34:58.961
Your sister and mother said
that you've isolated yourself

01:34:58.985 --> 01:34:59.985
since Michael died.

01:35:01.696 --> 01:35:02.736
Would you agree with them?

01:35:04.449 --> 01:35:07.782
Yeah. I mean, I certainly don't see them
as much as I used to.

01:35:10.079 --> 01:35:12.070
They also said you never talk
about your son.

01:35:24.886 --> 01:35:26.422
I don't know what they want me to say.

01:35:29.849 --> 01:35:31.464
I could talk about the, uh...

01:35:32.936 --> 01:35:35.598
Tumors in his brain and his spine.

01:35:38.441 --> 01:35:40.807
Thirty rounds of radiation.

01:35:44.072 --> 01:35:46.108
He used to scream when he had seizures.

01:35:51.204 --> 01:35:52.444
Nobody wants to hear that.

01:35:59.254 --> 01:36:01.119
We can't change the past, Jack.

01:36:04.968 --> 01:36:07.425
What we can do is choose
how we move forward.

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:12.634
Think about Michael.

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:17.386
What would he want for you?

01:36:53.266 --> 01:36:54.266
Hi

01:36:55.018 --> 01:36:56.018
Hey.

01:36:58.813 --> 01:36:59.848
Thanks for coming.

01:37:01.024 --> 01:37:02.059
Can I take your coat?

01:37:06.988 --> 01:37:08.944
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

01:37:14.412 --> 01:37:15.412
How's it going?

01:37:16.205 --> 01:37:17.786
Good. Good.

01:37:18.791 --> 01:37:21.157
Good.
I'm really glad you're here, Jack.

01:37:21.878 --> 01:37:23.869
Yeah. Me too.

01:37:26.215 --> 01:37:28.297
I shoulda come here
a long time ago.

01:37:31.304 --> 01:37:33.465
I just want you to know that, uh...

01:37:35.224 --> 01:37:36.805
I know that I failed you.

01:37:38.978 --> 01:37:40.809
And I know that I failed our marriage.

01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:47.228
I failed our son...

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:53.356
'Cause I didn't take care of his mom.

01:37:59.374 --> 01:38:01.080
And I hope that, uh,

01:38:02.043 --> 01:38:04.284
one day you can see in me...

01:38:06.047 --> 01:38:07.787
The man that, uh...

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:12.963
That you once hoped I would be.

01:38:21.354 --> 01:38:22.764
I'm so sorry.

01:39:39.348 --> 01:39:40.348
Hello?

01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:43.683
Hey, Dan. How you doing?

01:39:44.228 --> 01:39:46.685
It's, uh... it's Jack.

01:39:49.942 --> 01:39:51.142
Heavenly father,

01:39:51.486 --> 01:39:54.728
we welcome your presence here
among us and your spirit of love

01:39:54.822 --> 01:39:57.279
alive in the community of bishop Hayes.

01:39:57.366 --> 01:39:59.448
Please help us to be the best we can be.

01:39:59.869 --> 01:40:03.657
To strive not so much to win,
but to play fairly and well.

01:40:04.332 --> 01:40:07.699
We ask this in your name,
lord Jesus. Amen.

01:40:07.793 --> 01:40:08.793
Amen!

01:40:09.212 --> 01:40:12.830
Hey, fellas, let's win this fucking game
for coach Cunningham, baby.

01:40:18.554 --> 01:40:19.554
I'll talk to him.

01:40:22.558 --> 01:40:24.286
Let's go.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:25.140
Bring it home.

01:40:25.228 --> 01:40:27.765
All right, we stay
in press all game, okay?

01:40:27.855 --> 01:40:28.685
All right.

01:40:28.773 --> 01:40:30.626
Nobody gets past you.
You stay in their faces, all right?

01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:33.733
Play with that chip on your shoulder,
stay hungry. Who are we?

01:40:33.819 --> 01:40:34.729
- Hayes!
- Who are we?

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.673
- Hayes!
- Right! Win on three. Let's go.

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.233
One, two, three...

01:40:38.324 --> 01:40:39.324
Win!

01:41:04.809 --> 01:41:06.745
To the sharpshooter dawes in the corner.

01:41:06.769 --> 01:41:07.804
He fires up a three...

01:41:08.354 --> 01:41:09.560
And it's good!

01:41:09.647 --> 01:41:12.138
Hayes is hitting
on all cylinders tonight.

01:41:12.233 --> 01:41:15.600
For a team that
hasn't made the playoffs in 25 years,

01:41:15.695 --> 01:41:17.560
they seem to be awfully comfortable
out there.

01:41:17.655 --> 01:41:19.550
Full-court pressure again
from Hayes.

01:41:19.574 --> 01:41:21.009
Dougherty has just not been able

01:41:21.033 --> 01:41:22.052
to figure out the Hayes pressure.

01:41:22.076 --> 01:41:24.783
The defense has been
absolutely suffocating.

01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:26.656
Sanders trapped in the corner.

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:28.658
He fires across the court to Jenkins.

01:41:28.749 --> 01:41:30.159
Pass intercepted by durrett!

01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:32.617
Brandon durrett
is gonna take it by himself.

01:41:32.712 --> 01:41:34.919
Reverse layup and... it's good!

01:41:35.006 --> 01:41:36.837
- And he's fouled!
- Wow!

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:40.087
He has been really special today,
hasn't he, Tom?

01:41:40.177 --> 01:41:41.883
He has been magnificent.

01:41:41.971 --> 01:41:45.213
And now Hayes is out
to its biggest lead of the game.

01:41:45.308 --> 01:41:47.799
We said earlier
that coach Jack Cunningham,

01:41:47.893 --> 01:41:50.805
the man responsible
for this amazing turnaround,

01:41:50.896 --> 01:41:53.012
wasn't able to be on the bench today.

01:41:53.107 --> 01:41:55.940
But you have to imagine
he'd be very proud

01:41:56.027 --> 01:41:57.129
of the way these boys are playing.

01:41:57.153 --> 01:41:59.735
You know, I can remember
watching Jack as a player.

01:41:59.822 --> 01:42:04.236
He was tough, intense, competitive,
and he has instilled in these boys

01:42:04.327 --> 01:42:07.034
all those qualities
that made him such a winner.

01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:10.284
And you can see
Jack's imprint all over this team.

01:42:10.374 --> 01:42:12.254
Clearly a reflection of their coach.

01:42:12.293 --> 01:42:15.285
I have never seen a high school team
with this much composure.
