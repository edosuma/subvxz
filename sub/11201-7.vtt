00:01.634 --> 00:04.330
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:08.975 --> 00:11.341
Wasn't Daniel telling me about
a very powerful weapon

00:11.444 --> 00:13.503
in the hands of the Jaffa on Dakara?

00:13.613 --> 00:17.640
It's not a weapon, technically. But we
did adapt it to destroy the Replicators.

00:19.552 --> 00:22.020
Wait. Where are you going? I want to see.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.386
Can I hold her? She's my baby. Why...

00:25.125 --> 00:28.151
She will be the beacon of light
in the darkness

00:28.395 --> 00:30.363
to the warriors of the Ori.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.624
She will lead us to glorious victory.

00:33.066 --> 00:35.000
Wait, wait, wait,
we're talking about a baby here, right?

00:35.101 --> 00:36.261
She's been genetically altered.

00:36.369 --> 00:39.429
<i>She'll be a fully-grown figurehead</i>
<i>in a day or so.</i>

00:39.939 --> 00:41.133
Leave me. Grab her.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.241
Oh, yeah, like that's going to happen.

00:46.513 --> 00:49.107
Six more worlds have fallen to the Ori.

00:49.416 --> 00:51.577
According to those
who witnessed the battle,

00:51.718 --> 00:55.484
the enemy is led by a young woman
of extraordinary powers.

01:05.665 --> 01:07.428
Mark this day,

01:08.401 --> 01:10.494
for the darkness of your world
has been lifted

01:10.603 --> 01:13.231
so the light of Origin may shine upon it.

01:13.373 --> 01:14.840
(ALL CHEERING)

01:22.582 --> 01:27.042
You have cast aside the shackles of
the past to welcome a brighter future.

01:28.621 --> 01:33.456
Now, hear the words of the Orici.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.034
It's Adria.

01:42.902 --> 01:46.429
The unbelievers amongst you
sought to hinder our message.

01:46.906 --> 01:50.501
They took up arms
in an attempt to suppress the truth,

01:50.610 --> 01:53.204
but they failed and were vanquished.

01:54.547 --> 01:58.210
A reminder to all that
Origin cannot be extinguished.

01:58.651 --> 02:02.712
It will flourish throughout this world
and countless others.

02:08.761 --> 02:12.197
The believers amongst you
have been richly rewarded

02:12.966 --> 02:15.992
with truth, with Origin.

02:20.874 --> 02:25.743
It is now up to you to help others see
as you have seen,

02:26.946 --> 02:30.143
to spread the message
by joining the armies of the Ori.

02:41.427 --> 02:45.124
Sir, I'm picking up an energy reading
coming from the surface of the planet.

02:45.398 --> 02:46.729
What is it?

02:49.068 --> 02:52.333
It's a wave of radiation, sir,
emanating from the gate, spreading fast.

02:52.438 --> 02:54.030
Get them out of there.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.032
(ALL MURMURING)

03:13.726 --> 03:14.693
MAN: They're back on deck.

03:14.827 --> 03:17.421
- What happened?
- That's what we're trying to figure out.

03:17.630 --> 03:20.258
Sir I'm not picking up
any life signs on the planet.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.265
That's impossible.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.165
What is it, a sensor malfunction?

03:24.437 --> 03:26.905
All systems are operating normally.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.839
There are thousands of people
on that planet.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.076
CARTER: He's right.

03:33.179 --> 03:34.806
We're not picking up anything.

05:06.939 --> 05:08.531
Vala, wait.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.910
Look, we've still don't know
what happened down there.

05:13.112 --> 05:16.013
They're all dead, Daniel.
That's what happened.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.241
I'm sorry.

05:17.717 --> 05:18.741
What for?

05:18.851 --> 05:20.216
Well, believe it or not,
I know how you feel.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.753
Adria was your daughter,

05:21.854 --> 05:24.379
- and even though she was...
- Relief.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.582
That's what I feel. Relief.

05:29.128 --> 05:31.358
What, you don't think I'd want to be
responsible for the enslavement

05:31.464 --> 05:32.761
of an entire galaxy, do you?

05:32.865 --> 05:34.355
It was hardly your fault.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.799
I knew she was the will of the Ori
even before she was born.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.734
I could have done something about it,
but I didn't.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.533
She was your child.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.131
Maternal instinct
can only excuse so much.

05:43.609 --> 05:46.203
Of course, I did tell myself that
my relationship with her might prove

05:46.312 --> 05:49.145
to be an advantage,
that at some point, some critical moment,

05:49.248 --> 05:51.409
I might be able to reach her
in a way that no one else could.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.485
And you might have been right.

05:53.586 --> 05:56.316
I'm just relieved I'll never
have to find out for sure.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.623
<i>HARRIMAN: Unscheduled</i>

06:10.903 --> 06:13.337

Open the iris.

06:20.246 --> 06:21.372
Bra'tac.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.812
What brings you by?

06:25.952 --> 06:28.113
A matter that threatens millions of lives.

06:45.304 --> 06:46.999
<i>EMERSON ON RADIO:</i>
<i>Lieutenant Evans, report.</i>

06:47.106 --> 06:49.973
There's no sign of residual radiation, sir.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.271
<i>No chemical or biological agents</i>
<i>in the atmosphere.</i>

06:53.746 --> 06:55.475
<i>The place is clean.</i>

06:56.883 --> 07:01.547
The weird thing is, whatever it was,
it only seems to have targeted

07:01.654 --> 07:06.023
living tissue, 'cause everything else
was left behind.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.690
You said the wave emanated
from the stargate.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.789
That's right.

07:14.901 --> 07:18.462
From there it spread over the entire
surface of the planet before dissipating.

07:23.142 --> 07:24.268
What?

07:24.911 --> 07:28.781
We know of only one device
that would operate in such a manner.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.952
The council is convinced our only hope
for survival against the armies

07:36.055 --> 07:40.219
of the Ori is to attack them
using the ancient device on Dakara.

07:40.526 --> 07:42.926
The same device we used
to wipe out the Replicators.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.862
Except that now
it strikes with new purpose.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.058
To unmake living beings.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.528
Hours ago, the first target was struck,
a planet...

07:51.637 --> 07:53.104
We already know about it.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.868
SG-1 was there, doing recon.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.001
They were beamed out
before your weapon could hit them.

07:59.345 --> 08:01.609
The villagers weren't so lucky.

08:03.382 --> 08:06.317
- That is tragic.
- It's mass murder.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.683
Why the hell didn't you do
something about it?

08:08.821 --> 08:10.948
Our new leader, Se'tak, has convinced
the council

08:11.057 --> 08:13.525
that this is our only hope for survival.

08:13.626 --> 08:17.062
The more I spoke out against it,
the more isolated I became.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.894
I need to contact the <i>Odyssey,</i>
let them know what's happening,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.366
and then I need to meet this man myself.

08:39.919 --> 08:43.013
I am ashamed that my brothers
have utilized these methods.

08:43.923 --> 08:46.483
- They're desperate.
- There is no honor.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.194
Freedom without honor is meaningless.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.491
What's done is done,

08:53.666 --> 08:56.066
and there's still an opportunity here.

08:56.335 --> 08:59.862
We've got an Ori ship sitting
on the ground, unmanned and unguarded.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.545
We must act quickly.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.481
You know your way around this tub?

09:20.593 --> 09:23.790
All the corridors look the same.
I haven't got my bearings yet.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.622
There has to be some sort of control room.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.199
I'm guessing it'll be
in one of the forward sections.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.494
We've got a lot of ground to cover.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.537
Time to split up.

09:41.547 --> 09:43.515
Can I ask you a question?

09:44.016 --> 09:48.476
Just the fact you have to ask me
to ask me makes me think I should say no.

09:50.056 --> 09:52.889
Back on the <i>Odyssey,</i>
you said you knew how I felt.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.254
- What did you mean?
- What?

09:54.360 --> 09:56.260
Well, with Adria.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.262
You said, "Believe it or not,
I know how you feel."

09:58.364 --> 09:59.991
What did you mean?

10:01.434 --> 10:02.696
JACKSON: Yeah.

10:06.505 --> 10:09.941
Ten years ago,
my wife was taken as host by a Goa'uld.

10:13.012 --> 10:16.914
The framed picture on the wall
in your office, is that her?

10:17.083 --> 10:19.051
Yeah. Her name was Sha're.

10:19.251 --> 10:22.687
We were married for just over a year
when she was taken.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.015
I swore I would get her back.

10:25.858 --> 10:27.519
What happened?

10:28.594 --> 10:32.291
I joined SG-1 and searched for her
for over two years, but in the end,

10:32.398 --> 10:34.366
I couldn't save her.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.331
For a long time,
I felt guilty that I'd failed her.

10:39.338 --> 10:40.669
And now?

10:42.541 --> 10:44.805
Now, I can at least draw comfort
from the fact that she's no longer

10:44.910 --> 10:47.504
suffering at the hands of the Goa'uld.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.808
I guess in a small way,
I feel relieved as well.

11:15.574 --> 11:18.407
Wow, check this out.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.482
I'm no expert, but this looks important.

11:26.919 --> 11:28.887
It appears to be
a power generation chamber.

11:28.988 --> 11:32.446
Exactly, which has me thinking

11:32.558 --> 11:35.356
it could be a good place to drop a little C4.

11:35.995 --> 11:39.726
It would be our best opportunity to disable
the vessel, should it be necessary.

11:39.832 --> 11:43.893
Just in case we can't get this thing
flying before the Ori come back,

11:45.271 --> 11:49.537
we win one for the home team
while we're hauling ass for the gate.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.610
A great Jaffa once said,
"Exalted is the warrior

11:51.711 --> 11:53.201
"who achieves victory without battle."

11:53.312 --> 11:54.643
Winning shows strength.

11:54.747 --> 11:57.841
Winning without fighting shows true skill.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.151
You are a student of Ancient strategies.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.311
No, Landry said it to me.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.486
I think he was quoting Sun Tzu.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.581
Or it could have been Dr. Phil.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.358
LANDRY: I've already advised the Pentagon
that I'm heading offworld.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.729
I may be a while.

12:15.835 --> 12:18.269
With all due respect, sir, you think
you might consider taking along

12:18.370 --> 12:19.860
a few Marines?

12:19.972 --> 12:21.769
This is a diplomatic mission, Chief.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.638
The last time I checked,
the Jaffa were our allies.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.372
I can't go disrespecting them
in their own house.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.744
- Lf you say so, sir.
- Sometimes you make the right decision.

12:29.849 --> 12:32.443
Sometimes you make the decision right.

12:32.585 --> 12:35.145
- Patton?
- That one's Dr. Phil.

12:36.122 --> 12:39.216
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Bra'tac is waiting.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.304
Guys, I think I've found something.

12:55.407 --> 12:56.965
<i>JACKSON ON RADIO: What do you got?</i>

12:58.744 --> 13:01.008
<i>CARTER: I think it might be the bridge.</i>

13:02.114 --> 13:04.548
And it looks like
the main command interface is a chair,

13:04.650 --> 13:07.483
similar to the weapons platform
in Antarctica.

13:08.020 --> 13:11.012
It would make sense that the technology
would be similar to the Ancients.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.090
Vala, you said most of the people
on board the ship

13:13.192 --> 13:15.251
were simple villagers, right?

13:15.361 --> 13:16.623
Yes, why?

13:17.463 --> 13:20.694
I think it's likely the Priors
who are flying the ships.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.791
<i>Unfortunately, that probably means</i>

13:22.902 --> 13:25.700
<i>the chair is keyed</i>
<i>to their unique brain physiology.</i>

13:26.739 --> 13:29.037
MITCHELL: Don't sweat it.
Plan B is in place.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.901
Okay, let's not jump the gun just yet.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.706
At the very least, I'd like to
try to get some information

13:33.813 --> 13:36.873
out of this database
before we start blowing things up.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.440
I hear you, Sam, but it won't be long

13:39.552 --> 13:42.919
before the Ori come back for this ship,
and we're not going to let them...

13:45.791 --> 13:47.622

13:56.368 --> 13:58.063

13:58.170 --> 13:59.432
Not much,

14:01.040 --> 14:03.600
but we've got ourselves some company.

14:09.381 --> 14:14.011
I am Bo'rel of the free Jaffa, and
we have come to lay claim to this vessel.

14:14.119 --> 14:16.644
Slow down, brother. We were here first.

<i>CARTER: Cam, report.</i>

14:19.258 --> 14:21.089
It's all right, Sam.
Just a little misunderstanding

14:21.193 --> 14:23.559
with some of our Jaffa friends.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.631
- Go back to work.
- There is no misunderstanding.

14:26.732 --> 14:29.792
We achieved this victory,
therefore we claim the spoils.

14:29.902 --> 14:33.338
What you have done is sacrificed
the lives of thousands of innocents.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.600
No one is innocent who joins
with my enemy.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.269
They were invaded by an army
with massively superior firepower.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.743
They should have resisted.

14:40.846 --> 14:44.577
So die at the hands of the Ori
or die at the hands of the Jaffa.

14:45.451 --> 14:46.782
Some choice.

14:53.359 --> 14:54.792
What was that?

14:57.796 --> 15:00.993
Enough of this. The ship is ours.
Now, lower your weapons.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.462
- Get us out of here.
- Copy that.

16:49.808 --> 16:52.868
The Ori, it turns out, are not invincible.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.604
This first strike against them
must be considered nothing less

16:56.715 --> 16:58.478
than a complete success.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.176
BRA'TAC: But at what cost?

17:02.187 --> 17:03.415
Leave us.

17:12.664 --> 17:16.327
Unable to gather support from
your fellow Jaffa, you dishonor yourself

17:16.435 --> 17:18.369
by seeking it elsewhere.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.569
I'm honored.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.702
General Hank Landry.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.801
- The Tau'ri, your people...
- Are pissed.

17:27.312 --> 17:31.078
Your use of this Ancient device
violates our prior agreement.

17:32.484 --> 17:36.853
An agreement made with the former
leadership that I no longer feel bound to.

17:36.989 --> 17:40.152
So you're going to have your people
go back on their word?

17:41.560 --> 17:45.656
Much has changed since my predecessors
consented to that agreement.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.528
We now face an enemy powerful enough

17:48.634 --> 17:51.364
to have rendered
our conventional weapons useless.

17:52.037 --> 17:54.904
Your forces have proven
equally ineffective.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.339
This device is our only means
of striking back at them.

17:58.444 --> 18:01.311
Which includes
slaughtering innocent people.

18:02.915 --> 18:06.214
If future attacks against armies
of the Ori allow us to recover

18:06.318 --> 18:07.842
enough of their ships,

18:08.253 --> 18:12.417
we will then have a powerful fleet
with which to strike back against them.

18:12.958 --> 18:17.452
But until then,
this device is our only option.

18:18.564 --> 18:21.590
Incidental genocide is not an option.

18:22.634 --> 18:25.467
Granted, the cost of victory is great.

18:27.206 --> 18:30.835
But the cost of defeat
would be even greater.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.115
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

19:08.313 --> 19:10.804
All right, all right.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.822
(GROANS)

19:22.494 --> 19:25.554
Where is the rest of your team,
Colonel Mitchell?

19:29.835 --> 19:32.326
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:33.038 --> 19:35.734
You were speaking with a female.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.236
Right.

19:39.178 --> 19:43.171
She's back at the village,
probably gone through the gate by now.

19:43.782 --> 19:45.716
You are lying.

19:47.219 --> 19:50.188
This is a message
to all Tau'ri on board this vessel.

19:50.889 --> 19:52.754
<i>My name is Bo'rel.</i>

19:53.258 --> 19:56.819
<i>My brothers and I have taken this ship</i>
<i>in the name of all free Jaffa.</i>

19:57.696 --> 20:00.529
<i>We have Teal'c and Colonel Mitchell</i>
<i>in custody.</i>

20:00.632 --> 20:03.624
<i>Surrender now</i>
<i>and no harm will come to them.</i>

20:06.305 --> 20:09.638
If you do not identify yourselves
immediately, we will have no choice

20:09.741 --> 20:12.209
but to assume your intentions are hostile,

20:12.311 --> 20:15.712
in which case we will
deal with the prisoners harshly.

20:21.987 --> 20:23.386
So be it.

20:32.197 --> 20:35.428
Bo'rel, this is Daniel Jackson
of Stargate Command.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.198
Listen, there's no reason
we should be fighting each other.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.498
We should be working together.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.731
I'm afraid that would not be possible.

20:44.109 --> 20:45.974
Look, we're dealing
with some very advanced technology,

20:46.078 --> 20:48.546
and we have some experience
that might be useful.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.478
You doubt our ability to fly this ship?

20:55.821 --> 20:57.288
I'm just saying there's not a lot of time,

20:57.389 --> 21:00.984
and it would be in everyone's
best interests if we pool our resources.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.688
My orders are to take this ship
and all on board.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.395
You will reveal your location to me now.

21:07.532 --> 21:09.227
(ELECTRIC BUZZING)

21:21.747 --> 21:23.681
That won't be necessary.

21:25.450 --> 21:28.317
<i>- JAFFA: Bo'rel, we have them.</i>
<i>- Well done.</i>

21:28.420 --> 21:31.651
<i>Hold them until our patrols</i>
<i>find the control room.</i>

21:35.694 --> 21:37.719
You're making a big mistake.

21:37.829 --> 21:40.195
More Ori ships will be here soon.

21:40.932 --> 21:43.400
Then they will suffer the same fate.

21:43.502 --> 21:43.669
ADRIA: I think not.

21:43.669 --> 21:44.863
ADRIA: I think not.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.232
(CHOCKING)

22:04.656 --> 22:05.623
Adria.

22:08.126 --> 22:09.423
Hello, Mother.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.472
Okay.

22:21.606 --> 22:23.938
We all know, darling,
that you have telekinetic powers.

22:24.042 --> 22:26.203
You can stop showing off now.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.218
I've missed you, Mother.

22:34.486 --> 22:37.717
They said I should forget about you,
that you'd abandoned me

22:37.823 --> 22:40.519
- because you didn't care.
- No.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.354
I knew you'd come back for me.

22:42.461 --> 22:43.758
How is it that you're even alive?

22:43.862 --> 22:45.295
Everyone else on the planet was killed.

22:45.397 --> 22:47.092
I was saved by this.

22:47.232 --> 22:49.666
It holds a piece of the holy city of Celestis.

22:49.768 --> 22:51.963
It protects me, keeps me safe.

22:54.072 --> 22:56.199
Soon, the other ships will come for us,

22:56.308 --> 22:59.709
and once we're back with the fleet,
I promise you, Mother,

22:59.811 --> 23:02.006
we'll never be separated again.

23:14.159 --> 23:17.492
There are some who hold the Tau'ri
in great esteem for the assistance

23:17.596 --> 23:20.463
they provided us against the Goa'uld.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.056
I'm guessing you're not one of them?

23:24.669 --> 23:28.605
While I recognize the contributions
made, I question the motive.

23:29.708 --> 23:33.804
I suspect it had more to do
with self-preservation than generosity.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.477
We had a common enemy,

23:36.581 --> 23:39.607
and as much as the Tau'ri would have us
believe that we could not have defeated

23:39.718 --> 23:43.381
the Goa'uld without them, I know better.

23:45.190 --> 23:47.181
What is this device?

23:51.263 --> 23:53.026
Haven't got a clue.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.702
I will not ask you again.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.483
Nope. Still nothing.

24:20.325 --> 24:21.451
Yes.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.988
Find out what's happening.

24:41.913 --> 24:44.473
Listen, we're not rejoining the fleet.

24:44.583 --> 24:47.950
- You're coming with me.
- No, I can't abandon my army.

24:48.053 --> 24:51.955
- It's not your army.
- Of course it is.

24:52.057 --> 24:53.581
Well, as your mother,
I'm putting my foot down.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.557
You're too young to have your own army.

24:55.660 --> 24:59.289
They look to me for guidance,
for protection and for answers.

24:59.397 --> 25:02.833
Tell me what happened to my people
here on this planet.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.503
No, don't.

25:06.938 --> 25:08.906
He doesn't know anything.

25:15.947 --> 25:17.039
Adria!

25:17.148 --> 25:18.410
(PANTING)

25:20.318 --> 25:22.183
You have a strong mind.

25:25.790 --> 25:27.485
Wake up, Jaffa.

25:33.598 --> 25:35.031
Welcome back.

25:44.309 --> 25:45.469
Now, tell me,

25:46.478 --> 25:48.912
what happened to the believers
who came to spread Origin

25:49.014 --> 25:50.481
to this world?

25:53.451 --> 25:55.146
Yours is a backward people,

25:55.253 --> 25:58.051
too primitive to have created
such an effective weapon.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.723
So tell me,
how did it come into your hands?

26:04.229 --> 26:05.594
Where is it?

26:06.831 --> 26:09.061
- Stop.
- Don't interfere, Mother.

26:11.836 --> 26:13.269
Where, Jaffa?

26:38.897 --> 26:40.956
I didn't know you knew
how to use one of those things.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.795
Well, piece of cake.

26:47.005 --> 26:48.734
Where is the weapon?

26:54.079 --> 26:55.603
Dakara.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.079
(BONE CRACKING)

27:06.191 --> 27:07.488
Dakara.

27:12.764 --> 27:16.666
If you continue to use this weapon
in violation of our previous agreement,

27:16.768 --> 27:18.827
our alliance is in jeopardy.

27:18.937 --> 27:21.963
And what does this alliance do
to benefit the Jaffa?

27:22.140 --> 27:26.236
If it were not for the Tau'ri,
we would still be slaves to the Goa'uld.

27:26.344 --> 27:28.107
That was in the past.

27:29.014 --> 27:31.676
Now we face
a much more dangerous enemy,

27:31.816 --> 27:34.148
and every day,
while we lose ground to the Ori,

27:34.252 --> 27:37.380
the Tau'ri homeworld
remains curiously untouched.

27:40.592 --> 27:43.117
We are the ones fighting this battle.

27:43.228 --> 27:46.095
We are the ones dying by the thousands.

27:46.564 --> 27:50.523
And yet you choose to test
your new toy on a human world,

27:51.736 --> 27:55.672
not on one of a dozen Jaffa planets
that have fallen to the Ori.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.172
Why is that, exactly?

28:00.445 --> 28:02.777
This discussion is over.

28:11.222 --> 28:12.689
CARTER: The <i>Odyssey</i>
tried to beam us out of here,

28:12.791 --> 28:14.884
but somehow
the shields have been activated.

28:14.993 --> 28:16.722
At first, I thought it was
something I'd done,

28:16.828 --> 28:19.695
but after checking the controls,
I realized it wasn't me.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.132
MITCHELL: There's someone else on board.

28:22.233 --> 28:24.326
Three mother ships are in orbit
over the planet.

28:24.436 --> 28:27.496
The <i>Odyssey</i> had to retreat
in order to avoid being detected.

28:27.605 --> 28:30.631
TEAL'C: Then the stargate
is our only means of escape.

28:32.911 --> 28:34.845
Jackson. Vala. Come in.

28:37.348 --> 28:40.840
<i>MITCHELL: If you can hear me,</i>
<i>we're getting the hell out of Dodge.</i>

28:42.220 --> 28:43.482
Too late.

28:56.634 --> 28:57.760
Sam?

28:58.002 --> 28:59.299
I don't know.

29:07.412 --> 29:10.472
I need you to rally your supporters,
find out who's on side

29:10.582 --> 29:12.174
and who you can trust.

29:12.283 --> 29:14.012
In the meantime, I'm...

29:15.887 --> 29:17.980
What is the meaning of this?

29:18.456 --> 29:20.287
We just received word.

29:20.658 --> 29:23.388
The Ori ship has taken flight.

29:28.099 --> 29:31.830
I might be able to override
primary systems from the control room.

29:50.822 --> 29:55.259
Scans are detecting no transmitter signals
on the surface of the planet.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.855
Is it possible SG-1 escaped
through the gate?

29:59.964 --> 30:03.866
Well, if they had, Stargate Command
would have given us the heads-up by now.

30:03.968 --> 30:06.664
No, it's more likely
they're still on that ship.

30:07.605 --> 30:09.664
Sir, if that's the case,

30:09.774 --> 30:13.437
and it's on its way to rendezvous
with the rest of the Ori fleet,

30:13.545 --> 30:15.672
- we've lost them.
- Maybe not.

30:16.848 --> 30:18.748
We still may have a shot at rescuing SG-1

30:18.850 --> 30:21.478
provided that ship is headed
where I think it is.

30:23.421 --> 30:25.685
Major, set a course for Dakara.

30:29.260 --> 30:34.391
The Ori ship destroyed three Hatak vessels
before jumping into hyperspace.

30:34.699 --> 30:36.326
I'm sorry to hear that.

30:36.434 --> 30:38.868
The Jaffa on the planet
reported no gate activity,

30:38.970 --> 30:40.870
no other ships in the vicinity,

30:41.139 --> 30:43.767
nor were there any survivors
after the initial attack.

30:43.875 --> 30:47.538
Not a single soldier of the Ori
was left alive.

30:47.912 --> 30:49.470
What's your point?

30:49.581 --> 30:53.210
The only other people on board that ship
are from Stargate Command.

30:53.318 --> 30:56.287
You cannot possibly think
the Tau'ri are responsible for this.

30:56.387 --> 30:58.218
What other explanation is there?

30:58.323 --> 31:01.850
We're not in the habit
of conducting sneak attacks on our allies,

31:01.960 --> 31:04.224
however much we may disagree
with their tactics.

31:04.329 --> 31:07.492
You were jealous of the power
we command through the Ancient device.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.625
You sought to redress that balance
by taking the Ori ship.

31:10.735 --> 31:14.227
When the Hatak stood in your way,
they were swept aside.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.240
- Se'tak, this is madness.
- We shall see.

31:20.144 --> 31:21.441
Guard them.

31:50.174 --> 31:51.664
MITCHELL: Here's a question.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.776
Who's flying this boat?

31:56.414 --> 31:58.974
I know Tomin will be happy
to see you again.

31:59.717 --> 32:01.184
Tomin's alive?

32:02.186 --> 32:04.484
He wasn't on the planet with you?

32:04.589 --> 32:06.921
No. I've been traveling with various ships.

32:07.025 --> 32:09.118
As the leader of this great enlightenment,
it's important that

32:09.227 --> 32:10.353
I make my presence known,

32:10.461 --> 32:13.225
especially now when
the first inroads are being made.

32:13.331 --> 32:16.630
Once the rest of the fleet arrives,
I'll have a much harder time of it.

32:17.168 --> 32:19.068
How many other ships are coming?

32:19.170 --> 32:20.159
Many, many more.

32:20.271 --> 32:23.798
By my estimation, the galaxy
will be converted within the year.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.370
Jackson, come in.

32:31.015 --> 32:33.279
Jackson, Vala. Can you hear me?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.517
We're gonna have to go out there
and look for them.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.750
- Sam...
- I'll keep at it.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.837
Well, at least it's not raining.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.971
I don't know why you're complaining.

33:04.082 --> 33:06.073
You should be delighted.
As the mother of the Orici,

33:06.184 --> 33:08.846
you will be revered by
all the followers of Origin.

33:08.953 --> 33:12.787
While I appreciate the celebrity status,
I have to admit it would get

33:12.890 --> 33:17.452
very tiresome very quickly, especially if
I had to perform for the masses.

33:17.562 --> 33:19.530
I'm not very good with crowds.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.564
There will be no demands made on you.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.567
All you have to do
is accept Origin into your heart.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.504
That could be a problem.

33:27.638 --> 33:32.098
Perhaps at first, but eventually
you will embrace the truth.

33:33.244 --> 33:34.836
I don't think so.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.977
You're my mother.

33:37.081 --> 33:39.276
If I'm unable to convince you,

33:39.384 --> 33:43.115
how can I be expected to sway
the countless worlds in this galaxy?

33:43.888 --> 33:48.086
Until I have brought you into the fold,
my mission here is a failure.

33:48.926 --> 33:50.791
I can be very stubborn.

33:52.363 --> 33:56.800
Then I'll be patient and very determined.

33:57.735 --> 34:00.966
What about all the other people that
refuse to bow down to the will of the Ori?

34:01.072 --> 34:03.302
Are you gonna
show them the same courtesy?

34:03.608 --> 34:05.405
There is a limit to my patience.

34:05.510 --> 34:08.673
And there's a difference between
devotion and blind submission.

34:08.946 --> 34:11.141
You can't expect to win
the faith of your followers through fear

34:11.249 --> 34:12.841
and intimidation.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.042
What would you have me do?

34:16.654 --> 34:18.349
Give people a choice.

34:18.790 --> 34:22.590
I'm trying to bring an entire galaxy
from darkness into light.

34:22.827 --> 34:24.852
In order to do that,
all doubt must be removed

34:24.962 --> 34:27.294
or it will spread like a cancer.

34:27.932 --> 34:29.524
It's that simple.

34:34.138 --> 34:35.901
This is getting a little old, don't you think?

34:36.007 --> 34:38.441
You will turn this ship back immediately.

34:38.543 --> 34:41.068
Love to.
Unfortunately, we're not the ones flying it.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.373
You lie.

34:45.483 --> 34:47.917
Would you accuse me of lying as well?

34:50.254 --> 34:52.688
We are unaware of
who is in control of this vessel

34:52.790 --> 34:55.588
but suspect they may be on board with us.

34:55.893 --> 34:58.293
We, in fact, share a common enemy.

35:00.098 --> 35:03.158
Whatever's between us,
we can finish that later.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.130
Right now, we have to re-take this ship.

35:17.715 --> 35:19.444
That's more like it.

35:22.386 --> 35:23.580
- Adria, listen to me...
- I'm sorry, Mother.

35:23.688 --> 35:25.849
The time for talking is over.

35:27.692 --> 35:29.159
We've arrived.

35:42.673 --> 35:43.641
Is that what I think it is?

35:43.641 --> 35:44.369
Is that what I think it is?

35:45.276 --> 35:46.436
Dakara.

35:48.513 --> 35:50.879
My suspicions have been confirmed.

35:51.015 --> 35:53.074
What are you talking about?

35:53.584 --> 35:56.178
The Ori ship has arrived.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.812
You would try to force us
to give up the Ancient device

35:59.924 --> 36:02.222
rather than have us wield its power.

36:02.326 --> 36:05.818
I'm telling you,
my people are not responsible for this.

36:07.131 --> 36:11.067
We will gather our fleet
and lay siege to your world.

36:12.236 --> 36:16.673
We will take back the Ori ship
and avenge our fallen brothers.

36:23.414 --> 36:28.351
You don't think that whoever is flying
this boat is on a friendly trip, do you?

36:30.721 --> 36:32.416
No. Me neither.

36:33.157 --> 36:37.821
With the engines activated, there may be
a significantly greater reaction to the C4.

36:39.063 --> 36:40.860
The ship may well be destroyed.

36:40.965 --> 36:43.229
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

36:44.869 --> 36:47.929
We must not allow this ship
to launch an attack.

36:51.475 --> 36:52.601
Right.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.214
Colonel Mitchell...

37:08.326 --> 37:11.318
Just trying to think
of some appropriate last words.

37:25.243 --> 37:26.710
What happened?

37:27.111 --> 37:28.305
Nothing.

37:31.449 --> 37:32.882
Yeah, I know.

37:33.684 --> 37:34.878
Why not?

37:38.089 --> 37:39.249
You should thank me.

37:39.357 --> 37:40.551
I just saved your lives.

37:40.658 --> 37:42.717
What are you talking about?

37:43.094 --> 37:44.425
(GRUNTING)

37:53.504 --> 37:55.563
<i>EMERSON ON RADIO:</i>
<i>SG-1, this is Odyssey. Do you read?</i>

37:55.673 --> 37:57.641
<i>Odyssey,</i> this is Colonel Carter.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.140
<i>We're gonna try</i>
<i>and beam you out of there.</i>

37:59.243 --> 38:01.040
It won't work. The shield is still active.

38:01.145 --> 38:03.477
I'm trying to shut it down.
Please stand ready.

38:07.251 --> 38:11.085
The weapon is capable of firing
through a gate but it is also capable

38:11.188 --> 38:14.214
of releasing a wave that will
encompass this world and beyond,

38:14.325 --> 38:18.989
wiping out all life forms on any ships
that happen to be in planetary orbit.

38:20.931 --> 38:24.128
We will be perfectly safe here
within this shielded chamber.

38:24.869 --> 38:28.862
You will survive to bear witness.

38:29.006 --> 38:34.672
The Jaffa have finally taken their rightful
place as a true power in this galaxy.

38:39.450 --> 38:41.281
JACKSON: It won't be that easy.

38:42.286 --> 38:45.551
Why wouldn't it be? I'm about to destroy
the only real threat against us.

38:45.656 --> 38:48.147
You're forgetting about someone.
What about the Ancients?

38:48.359 --> 38:51.328
You know as well as I do
they'll never get involved.

38:51.429 --> 38:53.920
We have free rein in this galaxy.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.292
Adria, listen to me.

38:56.767 --> 38:59.736
I promise to stay with you.
I'll hear you out on the whole Origin thing.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.328
I'll even try and keep an open mind.

39:03.307 --> 39:05.207
Just let everyone else go.

39:05.309 --> 39:08.073
It's too late for them, but don't worry.

39:09.980 --> 39:12.380
I'll be keeping him alive.

39:14.618 --> 39:16.449
We have plans for you.

39:25.396 --> 39:26.658
We are ready.

39:27.732 --> 39:30.223
My people may be on board that ship.

39:30.601 --> 39:32.330
Not for much longer.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.094
Fire the weapon.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.622
<i>Odyssey,</i> we're good to go.

39:56.727 --> 39:58.752
- Get them the hell out of there.
- Yes, sir.

40:13.811 --> 40:14.778
Now.

40:38.402 --> 40:39.369
What happened?

40:39.470 --> 40:41.768
The weapon appears to have had no effect.

40:41.872 --> 40:43.203
(EXPLOSION)

40:44.008 --> 40:45.339
Come! Come!

40:49.380 --> 40:50.813
The area was evacuated.

40:50.915 --> 40:52.439
The gate is unguarded!

40:55.286 --> 40:56.617
Fire again.

40:58.222 --> 40:59.780
Fire the weapon!

41:19.043 --> 41:20.510
There is news.

41:24.882 --> 41:29.251
A cargo ship dispatched to the area has
reported complete and utter devastation.

41:30.721 --> 41:32.348
Dakara is no more.

41:34.792 --> 41:37.886
Meanwhile, we received word that
five more planets have fallen to the Ori,

41:37.995 --> 41:39.986
including Hebridan and Langara.

41:40.097 --> 41:43.726
So far, we haven't heard anything
from our allies on either world.

41:43.834 --> 41:48.703
We are getting our asses whooped,
and it looks like that Merlin device

41:48.806 --> 41:51.070
is the only shot we have at stopping them.

41:51.175 --> 41:54.008
Then find it. Dismissed.

41:59.283 --> 42:01.046
The council is in disarray.

42:01.151 --> 42:03.142
The Jaffa nation is fractured,

42:03.821 --> 42:05.755
and without Dakara
to bring us all together,

42:05.856 --> 42:09.792
I fear everything we have fought for
all these years will be lost.

42:10.294 --> 42:12.592
The war is not over, old friend.

42:12.730 --> 42:15.790
If only I could have done more
to oppose Se'tak.

42:16.267 --> 42:19.794
There's nothing to be gained
by second-guessing yourself.

42:20.437 --> 42:22.268
Can't remake the past,

42:24.275 --> 42:25.742
so look ahead.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.537
Or risk being left behind.

42:38.756 --> 42:42.214
She displays the wisdom
of a battle-seasoned warrior.

42:44.428 --> 42:45.918
JACKSON: She's a mother.

42:47.698 --> 42:49.131
Close enough.
