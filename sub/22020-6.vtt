WEBVTT

00:00.828 --> 00:05.631
And Community Play is about
more than just providing gyms.

00:06.700 --> 00:09.702
It's about building bridges
between law enforcement

00:09.727 --> 00:11.261
and at-risk kids.

00:11.286 --> 00:12.587
It's a place where kids get to know

00:12.621 --> 00:14.488
the person behind the badge.

00:14.523 --> 00:17.692
And police aren't making
arrests and asking questions.

00:17.726 --> 00:21.406
Instead they're giving their
perspectives on leadership,

00:22.197 --> 00:24.985
conflict resolution, empathy,

00:25.243 --> 00:27.511
and most importantly, trust.

00:27.536 --> 00:31.539
Community Play thrives
on good folks like you.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.174
And when I say good folks,

00:33.208 --> 00:35.710
I mean caring, compassionate people

00:35.744 --> 00:37.845
who are also willing
to open those wallets.

00:42.491 --> 00:45.026
You know, earlier tonight
I was taking a little walk

00:45.053 --> 00:48.689
on beautiful streets
here on the North Side.

00:48.724 --> 00:50.891
This is the Chicago we all want.

00:50.926 --> 00:54.462
Family friendly. A safe
haven from gun violence.

00:54.496 --> 01:00.034
And with your help, we've made
this little organization

01:00.068 --> 01:02.737
a safe haven as well.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.272
So thank you for coming
tonight, and God bless.

01:07.009 --> 01:08.643
Thank you.

01:08.677 --> 01:10.544
Yo, let's get out of here
and get a real drink.

01:10.579 --> 01:12.747
Hey, how are Vinessa and Jordan doing?

01:12.781 --> 01:14.482
They're actually doing pretty good.

01:14.516 --> 01:16.917
I told 'em though, if
they become Cowboys fans,

01:16.952 --> 01:18.452
they can't come back.

01:18.487 --> 01:20.788
- Is that a possibility?
- You wanna roll?

01:20.822 --> 01:22.657
We're off the clock in ten minutes.

01:22.691 --> 01:24.091
Unless you know another place

01:24.126 --> 01:26.093
serving free Chantal de Laroque?

01:26.128 --> 01:29.630
Wow. You're really um...
Oh what's the word?

01:29.665 --> 01:31.499
Le snob.

01:31.533 --> 01:33.401
The Lake Forest in me escaping.

01:33.435 --> 01:35.136
What? I thought you were from Greektown.

01:35.170 --> 01:37.238
That's just a story I tell in bars.

01:37.272 --> 01:38.506
- Hmm.
- Just kidding.

01:38.540 --> 01:41.275
We moved there when I was 11.

01:45.347 --> 01:46.814
You know that guy?

01:46.848 --> 01:49.984
Yeah. Sean McGrady.
Sergeant out of narcotics.

01:50.018 --> 01:51.419
Couple years back

01:51.453 --> 01:53.254
I was assigned to
his joint investigation.

01:53.288 --> 01:54.455
Good police.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.824
She says with hesitation.

01:56.858 --> 01:58.526
No, he is. He's just...

01:58.560 --> 02:03.097
Competitive. Always looking
for an angle. Drove me nuts.

02:03.131 --> 02:05.833
Hank! Glad you came.

02:05.867 --> 02:07.468
I appreciate all the time and effort

02:07.502 --> 02:09.470
your team has put in around here.

02:09.503 --> 02:12.106
It's a good cause. Happy to help.

02:12.140 --> 02:13.774
It's a hell of a shindig.

02:13.809 --> 02:15.976
Well, you got to
spend money to make money.

02:16.011 --> 02:16.977
Mm.

02:18.647 --> 02:20.514
Sean, we need to talk about this!

02:20.549 --> 02:21.949
- Oh you want to talk?
- Yeah. Tonight!

02:21.983 --> 02:23.718
You want to talk about this now?

02:23.752 --> 02:26.387
- What, are you out of your mind?
- Hey! Hey! Whoa!

02:26.421 --> 02:28.289
- What's going on?
- No, we're good.

02:28.323 --> 02:31.459
Right? We're good.

02:31.493 --> 02:34.462
It's good to see you, Hailey.

02:34.496 --> 02:35.963
You okay?

02:35.997 --> 02:38.632
Yeah. It was just a misunderstanding.

02:40.669 --> 02:42.303
We got shots fired nearby.

02:42.337 --> 02:44.371
- Active shooter.
- Okay.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:59.454 --> 03:01.822
- I've got it.
- Stairs.

03:06.027 --> 03:07.762
I got two down!

03:07.796 --> 03:09.130
Cover me.

03:14.603 --> 03:17.171
- Anything?
- They're both gone.

03:28.550 --> 03:31.118
He got a pulse. Call an ambo.

03:31.153 --> 03:33.788
This is 5021 Charlie.
Roll an ambo to our location.

03:33.822 --> 03:36.056
3 GSWs, one still breathing.

03:36.091 --> 03:39.693
Nine mil casings. Male takes
one to the back of the head.

03:39.728 --> 03:41.228
Female takes two to the chest.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.897
Dad gets beat, then popped.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.632
Wife walks in. Goodbye witness.

03:44.666 --> 03:46.200
Son Ryan, he's hiding out
in the bathroom.

03:46.234 --> 03:48.202
Killer finds him.
He takes two to the chest.

03:48.236 --> 03:49.637
Anything on the victims yet?

03:49.671 --> 03:52.706
Yeah. Grant Hammond,
wife Margaret, son Ryan.

03:52.741 --> 03:54.809
Grant was a corporate attorney.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.443
Looks like he spent a lot of
time at his church.

03:56.478 --> 03:58.546
Hey. I think we found what the killers

03:58.580 --> 04:00.681
were looking for upstairs.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.887
Praise the Lord.

04:06.922 --> 04:09.557
Two keys. That's about
200 grand street value.

04:09.591 --> 04:11.559
I've seen guys kill over a lot less.

04:11.593 --> 04:13.704
So much for the safe haven
of the North Side.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.441
Oh, Mia, huh? You got a new honey, dawg?

04:27.475 --> 04:30.411
It was more like a
one night acquaintance.

04:30.445 --> 04:32.413
Good evening, ma'am. I'm Officer Ruzek,

04:32.447 --> 04:35.482
- this is Officer Atwater, we...
- I was about to call you.

04:35.517 --> 04:37.952
Oh. We don't get that a lot.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.921
- Did you see something?
- I was in the kitchen.

04:40.956 --> 04:45.092
At first I heard shouting,
then three loud pops.

04:45.126 --> 04:47.595
I went to the window, and a few
seconds later, a man ran out.

04:47.629 --> 04:49.430
Okay. What does this man look like?

04:49.464 --> 04:53.930
He was tall. Um... dark skinned.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.837
- Black?
- Yes.

04:56.872 --> 04:59.840
He had a hat on.
I couldn't really see his face.

04:59.875 --> 05:02.943
He got into a black SUV. Drove away.

05:02.978 --> 05:04.678
- It happened so fast.
- Okay.

05:04.713 --> 05:06.447
Were you friends with the Hammonds?

05:06.481 --> 05:09.283
- Did you know them well?
- Yeah. Yeah, we were friends.

05:09.317 --> 05:12.353
He and Margaret were over
two weeks ago for dinner.

05:12.387 --> 05:13.621
Okay. Did they mention anything?

05:13.655 --> 05:15.122
Have any problems with anyone?

05:15.156 --> 05:18.626
No. No, they were on top of the world.

05:18.660 --> 05:21.195
They were so proud of Ryan, their son.

05:21.229 --> 05:24.531
How well he was doing at Yale.

05:24.566 --> 05:27.534
I saw Ryan taken out on a stretcher.

05:27.569 --> 05:30.371
Is he okay?

05:30.405 --> 05:31.972
As far as we know he's alive.

05:32.007 --> 05:33.974
He's in surgery right now
at Chicago Med.

05:34.009 --> 05:36.510
Have a good night. Thank you.

05:37.846 --> 05:39.480
So far no surveillance or PODS

05:39.514 --> 05:40.681
caught sight of the shooter.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.316
Anything on Grant Hammond?

05:42.350 --> 05:44.585
Asset Forfeiture, they ran
the round robin on him.

05:44.619 --> 05:47.221
He was broke, he was
juggling five credit cards.

05:47.255 --> 05:48.689
Hasn't received a check

05:48.723 --> 05:50.491
from his last employer in over a year.

05:50.525 --> 05:52.493
That would be his law firm.
They let him go last year.

05:52.527 --> 05:54.028
Okay. Any cash deposits
to his bank account?

05:54.062 --> 05:55.663
No, he was a little smarter than that.

05:55.697 --> 05:57.431
He was using a safety deposit box,

05:57.465 --> 05:59.700
but the bank filled out an SAR
on him for frequent visits.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.835
Okay, so he is dealing on the side

06:01.870 --> 06:03.570
- to make ends meet.
- Mm-hm.

06:03.605 --> 06:04.905
Or to keep up his perfect lifestyle.

06:04.940 --> 06:07.107
Fancy brownstone. Kid in college.

06:07.142 --> 06:09.176
Guys, I think I have
a lead on the supplier.

06:09.210 --> 06:10.444
Good place to start.

06:10.478 --> 06:11.912
Techs ran GPS on Hammond's car.

06:11.947 --> 06:13.681
He'd been making multiple
trips to Englewood.

06:13.715 --> 06:15.950
- Got an address?
- 6241 South Racine.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.785
Stash house is linked to a Quinton Kane.

06:17.819 --> 06:19.253
Apparently he's a pretty serious player.

06:19.287 --> 06:20.888
Moves a lot of product
through the Gold Coast.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.523
All right. Get the details on Kane,

06:22.557 --> 06:24.258
then get some eyes on him.

06:24.292 --> 06:27.361
Oh, you should probably
contact McGrady in Narcotics.

06:27.395 --> 06:28.862
His team covers that area.

06:28.897 --> 06:30.764
- Sarge?
- Huh?

06:30.799 --> 06:33.300
Makes for a crowded van.

06:33.335 --> 06:36.537
You saying you got a
problem with McGrady?

06:36.571 --> 06:37.972
Yeah.

06:38.006 --> 06:41.241
Well, work it out. You got a job to do.

06:47.582 --> 06:50.017
Oh, this seems like old times.

06:51.252 --> 06:53.087
Look I know we've had our differences,

06:53.121 --> 06:54.788
but let's just focus on the job.

06:54.823 --> 06:56.724
Keep it professional, okay?

06:56.758 --> 06:59.326
So what do we know about Quinton Kane?

06:59.361 --> 07:01.395
Well, he's a main suspect
in three homicides

07:01.429 --> 07:02.896
that I've been chasing.

07:02.931 --> 07:04.498
We get close,
but you know, no indictment

07:04.532 --> 07:06.400
thanks to the brave ASAs.

07:06.434 --> 07:09.069
- You know what flag he flies?
- Yeah. It's the 100 Syndicate.

07:09.104 --> 07:10.904
He has a couple of legit businesses too.

07:10.939 --> 07:12.906
- Any priors?
- Mm-hmm. Two.

07:12.941 --> 07:15.181
Five years ago agg battery.
And then three months ago DUI.

07:15.212 --> 07:16.510
Case still pending.

07:16.544 --> 07:18.412
Listen this is how I want
to run it, all right?

07:18.446 --> 07:20.080
I'm gonna take the main eye.
Hailey, you handle the log.

07:20.115 --> 07:21.949
Jay, I want to do stills and video,

07:21.983 --> 07:23.650
'cause we want to prove
that it's an open-air market

07:23.685 --> 07:25.719
that Kane's running,
all right? Let's go.

07:34.629 --> 07:37.264
We're so sorry for your loss, Ryan.

07:37.298 --> 07:40.667
Yeah. The doctor says
you're doing great.

07:40.702 --> 07:45.205
Do you remember anything
about last night?

07:45.240 --> 07:47.975
A few things.

07:48.009 --> 07:51.211
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Take it slow.

07:51.246 --> 07:53.180
All right, you had dinner
with your parents?

07:53.214 --> 07:55.449
Yeah.

07:55.483 --> 07:58.352
I went to my bedroom.

07:58.386 --> 08:01.455
I was tired from my flight.

08:01.489 --> 08:04.358
I was FaceTiming with a friend.

08:05.727 --> 08:07.795
Then I heard the door buzz.

08:07.829 --> 08:12.499
My dad let someone in.

08:12.534 --> 08:15.636
I heard arguing.

08:15.670 --> 08:18.205
Was your dad expecting anyone?

08:18.239 --> 08:22.509
- No.
- Did you recognize the voice?

08:22.544 --> 08:24.244
No.

08:24.279 --> 08:27.414
He kept yelling,

08:27.449 --> 08:31.318
"This ain't how it works."

08:31.352 --> 08:35.389
- What happened next?
- I heard gunshots.

08:38.860 --> 08:42.162
- I didn't know what to do.
- It's okay.

08:42.197 --> 08:47.267
I ran towards my bathroom... to hide.

08:47.302 --> 08:49.169
I got hit.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.040
Ryan...

08:53.074 --> 08:55.809
did you see the man who shot you?

09:09.924 --> 09:13.026
- There he is.
- Hm.

09:13.061 --> 09:15.028
Can I... Can I see it?

09:16.631 --> 09:18.031
Oh, hell, yeah. Yeah

09:18.066 --> 09:19.700
The guy on the left,
that's Quinton Kane.

09:19.734 --> 09:21.201
He's a stone cold killer.

09:21.236 --> 09:25.205
The guy with him
is Bernard Ward, AKA "Bay Bay."

09:25.240 --> 09:27.608
That's the black SUV.
Just like the neighbor said.

09:27.642 --> 09:29.276
Great. Well I think it's time

09:29.310 --> 09:31.378
that we should have a little
chat with Citizen Kane.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.281
Halsted.

09:36.918 --> 09:38.418
Okay. Got it.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.254
The son Ryan Hammond,
he just ID'd the shooter

09:40.288 --> 09:42.489
as a tall black man
with some sort of dog tattoo

09:42.524 --> 09:43.724
on his right forearm.

09:43.758 --> 09:46.426
- Oh.
- Check the file.

09:46.461 --> 09:49.396
That's Kane. Dog claw.

09:49.430 --> 09:51.565
That's the 100 Syndicate
initiation tattoo.

09:51.599 --> 09:53.667
That's good enough for me.
Let's grab him up.

10:05.847 --> 10:07.481
Thanks for coming in, Quinton.

10:07.515 --> 10:09.449
So how well do you know Grant Hammond?

10:09.484 --> 10:10.984
Grant who?

10:11.019 --> 10:13.537
Don't disrespect me like that, Quinton.

10:13.562 --> 10:15.656
He had you on speed dial.
He was your Gold Coast connect,

10:15.690 --> 10:17.257
and we got a lot of people
whispering around here

10:17.292 --> 10:19.126
saying he's running dope for you.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.161
Oh, that Grant Hammond.

10:21.196 --> 10:24.364
No. He just gives me legal advice.

10:24.399 --> 10:28.101
- See I'm incorporated now.
- Well good for you.

10:28.136 --> 10:31.271
So where were you last night?

10:31.306 --> 10:33.540
You gonna tell me what this is about?

10:33.575 --> 10:37.311
- I got places to be.
- Well not anymore.

10:41.049 --> 10:44.618
What? You don't recognize
him? Ryan Hammond? 19?

10:44.652 --> 10:48.655
Come on. You shot him
in the chest last night.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.291
Right there.

10:51.326 --> 10:53.994
Guess what?

10:54.028 --> 10:58.165
It turns out that this kid is a fighter.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.100
He survived.

11:02.103 --> 11:05.005
And he just ID'd you as the shooter.

11:05.039 --> 11:09.243
- I didn't shoot no one.
- Quinton. Come on.

11:09.277 --> 11:11.211
I'm throwing you a lifeline here.

11:11.246 --> 11:14.181
I'm giving you a chance to tell
your side of the story.

11:14.215 --> 11:18.585
Come on. All right. I'll help you out.

11:18.620 --> 11:21.688
He owed you money. No, I got it. Right.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.992
He shot at you, and you were
just defending yourself.

11:25.026 --> 11:27.361
- That's a really good one.
- Mm.

11:29.097 --> 11:31.198
Am I under arrest?

11:36.738 --> 11:38.572
You're free to go.

11:46.047 --> 11:48.015
Two dead bodies, a dying college kid,

11:48.049 --> 11:49.349
and we got to kick Kane free

11:49.384 --> 11:51.351
because Ryan Hammond's ID is too vague.

11:51.386 --> 11:54.021
Yeah, well, we're lucky we
got what we got when we got it.

11:54.055 --> 11:57.090
What do you mean?

11:57.125 --> 12:00.060
I just talked to Med. Ryan
Hammond died 10 minutes ago.

12:01.963 --> 12:04.298
He's 19 years old. He's just
back home from college.

12:04.332 --> 12:06.233
Without Ryan's testimony, we
don't have a case against Kane.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.435
So that son of a bitch might
actually get away with it.

12:08.469 --> 12:11.938
We just gotta get back out
there, find new evidence.

12:11.973 --> 12:14.875
- Hey, did you talk to McGrady?
- Yeah. I just talked to him.

12:14.909 --> 12:17.711
He said he wants to meet up
and go over the case tonight.

12:17.745 --> 12:19.046
Meet up and go over the case?

12:19.080 --> 12:20.547
Did he bring up new leads, new evidence?

12:20.581 --> 12:23.917
No. He didn't mention anything.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.787
Is this really about the case?

12:26.821 --> 12:29.323
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.825
Okay.

12:43.538 --> 12:47.407
<i>Ten one! 6245 squad.
Shot fired at the police.</i>

12:47.442 --> 12:51.244
<i>I'm at 5392 South Hoyne.
I've been hit! Oh God.</i>

12:51.279 --> 12:54.281
<i>Officer down! Oh, my God. Agh.</i>

12:54.315 --> 12:56.316
This is 5021 Charlie. I'm en route

12:56.351 --> 12:57.984
to the officer calling the ten one.

12:58.019 --> 13:00.120
I will respond. I'm five blocks away.

13:00.154 --> 13:03.156
<i>Copy that. Copy that.
6245 hang in there.</i>

13:20.808 --> 13:24.277
5021 Charlie. I'm at the
scene of the ten one.

13:24.312 --> 13:27.447
<i>Copy that, 5021 Charlie.</i>

13:39.994 --> 13:43.029
Mac? Mac.

13:43.064 --> 13:46.700
Oh God. Mac! Mac!

13:46.734 --> 13:49.636
I got an officer down!
I repeat, officer down!

13:49.670 --> 13:52.305
- Send me some help now!
<i>- Copy that.</i>

13:52.340 --> 13:53.707
Stay with me, Mac. Stay with me.

13:53.741 --> 13:57.878
Come on. Come on.
No, no, no, no. Mac! Mac!

14:02.583 --> 14:05.352
Mac. Mac!

14:09.204 --> 14:10.821
Yeah, so what's the latest?

14:10.867 --> 14:12.637
I got Area South, tact, gang,

14:12.653 --> 14:14.429
and patrol officers out in full force,

14:14.464 --> 14:18.032
going door to door searching
every gangway and garage.

14:18.154 --> 14:20.456
So far no sign of the
offender, no witnesses.

14:20.481 --> 14:22.382
Well, you tell me what you
need, I'll make it happen.

14:22.407 --> 14:24.008
I know you will, Denny. We're good.

14:24.042 --> 14:26.944
Okay, look. I know everyone is hot.

14:26.978 --> 14:29.613
One of our very own was just killed.

14:29.648 --> 14:32.502
But keep it on the up and up.

14:33.151 --> 14:34.952
Hey, Ray. Thanks for coming.

14:34.986 --> 14:37.087
Any way I can help, just let me know.

14:37.122 --> 14:38.756
I have the church down the block.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.558
It's open for your officers.
Coffee and bottled water.

14:40.592 --> 14:42.726
Hey, thanks.
I appreciate that. Excuse me.

14:42.761 --> 14:44.395
Any leads?

14:44.429 --> 14:45.796
Nothing solid.

14:45.831 --> 14:48.365
Maybe connected
to the Gold Coast murders.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.402
Listen. The slain officer's
name was McGrady.

14:51.436 --> 14:54.138
He was working a lead on Quinton Kane.

14:54.172 --> 14:56.040
Runs in your ward. You heard of him?

14:56.074 --> 14:57.708
I know the name.

14:57.742 --> 15:00.611
That mean he helped finance
your redevelopment projects?

15:00.645 --> 15:02.046
It means I know the name.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.315
If this bastard killed a police officer,

15:04.349 --> 15:08.552
a guy I worked with, a guy I respected,

15:08.587 --> 15:11.121
I expect your full cooperation.

15:11.156 --> 15:13.224
Goes without saying.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.263
Talk to me.

15:19.297 --> 15:21.765
Yeah, so apparently what
happened, Sarge,

15:21.800 --> 15:24.068
McGrady got jumped in the
front seat of the vehicle,

15:24.102 --> 15:25.669
and then from there it was
just a fight for his weapon.

15:25.704 --> 15:29.006
Offender shot him twice.
One in the vest point blank,

15:29.040 --> 15:30.674
one in the neck, through and through.

15:30.709 --> 15:32.343
That's what shattered the glass.

15:32.377 --> 15:34.078
The only prints we could find
on the gun were McGrady's.

15:34.112 --> 15:36.013
There was blood on the grip of the gun.

15:36.047 --> 15:37.915
We sent the gun
to the crime lab already.

15:37.949 --> 15:40.150
This might have just been
a random robbery.

15:40.185 --> 15:42.152
Or maybe he got into it with a CI?

15:42.187 --> 15:44.355
All right, so dump
McGrady's phone right away.

15:44.389 --> 15:48.325
Identify everyone he was in
contact with the last 24 hours.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.594
- Witnesses?
- I talked to one witness.

15:50.629 --> 15:53.197
Saw a black SUV around the
building about 20 minutes

15:53.231 --> 15:55.299
before McGrady was shot.
Black male behind the wheel.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.034
- Kane?
- It's possible.

15:57.068 --> 15:58.636
All right. So start digging.

15:58.670 --> 16:01.205
Find out where he was when this
whole thing went down.

16:01.239 --> 16:03.374
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

16:03.408 --> 16:05.342
Hey, Jake, give me
a second alone with her.

16:05.377 --> 16:07.044
Yeah. Sure, Sarge. Let me
know if you need anything.

16:07.078 --> 16:09.847
Thanks. Hey.

16:09.881 --> 16:14.485
Tough thing to go through. I'm sorry.

16:14.519 --> 16:16.053
But I gotta ask.

16:16.087 --> 16:19.723
Why did you let McGrady drive in alone?

16:19.758 --> 16:21.191
Excuse me?

16:21.226 --> 16:23.727
You were supposed to be
working with him.

16:23.762 --> 16:26.063
I was working with him.

16:26.097 --> 16:27.898
He knew I was coming.
We just got off the phone.

16:27.933 --> 16:30.634
- I told him to wait for me.
- While you stopped for coffee?

16:30.669 --> 16:33.037
He was supposed to wait for me!

16:33.071 --> 16:35.906
But you were late!

16:35.941 --> 16:37.408
That's not fair.

16:37.442 --> 16:40.511
And I wasn't late.
I was ten minutes early.

16:40.545 --> 16:42.813
He's dead, Hailey.

16:42.847 --> 16:45.082
I don't really care about fair.

17:07.571 --> 17:09.506
I'm so sorry.

17:09.540 --> 17:13.077
If there's anything you need,
anything I can do...

17:13.111 --> 17:14.678
Thank you.

17:18.817 --> 17:21.050
Ladies.

17:21.086 --> 17:23.354
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:24.422 --> 17:27.458
Why don't you go sit down?
Have something to eat?

17:27.492 --> 17:29.693
Maybe a glass of wine, all right?

17:38.303 --> 17:42.640
Nice of you to come by, Hailey,
but I think we're good.

17:42.674 --> 17:45.042
I was on my way to meet him, Arnold.

17:45.076 --> 17:46.543
He decided to go in early.

17:46.578 --> 17:49.713
I'd rather not discuss that now.

17:49.748 --> 17:52.416
Not here. Not in front of Anne.

17:52.450 --> 17:55.285
Look, I know you guys were
partners for a long time.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.622
You ever known him to go
in solo like that?

17:58.657 --> 18:00.090
No.

18:01.259 --> 18:02.760
He told me he was meeting a snitch

18:02.794 --> 18:04.161
about the Gold Coast murders...

18:04.195 --> 18:07.431
I don't want to discuss any of this now.

18:07.465 --> 18:09.566
Just get the hell out of here.

18:10.835 --> 18:12.169
Go.

18:21.312 --> 18:22.680
- That's it?
- Uh-huh.

18:22.714 --> 18:24.348
Hey, Sarge, you want to hear this.

18:24.382 --> 18:25.849
- Okay.
- We dumped McGrady's phone.

18:25.884 --> 18:27.918
And this is the only cat that popped up.

18:27.952 --> 18:29.920
An informant named Damon Briggs
that wasn't on the books yet.

18:29.954 --> 18:31.455
I spoke to McGrady's partner.

18:31.489 --> 18:33.757
Briggs is a catch and
release on a gun charge.

18:33.792 --> 18:35.359
Slinging a lot of attitude.

18:35.393 --> 18:37.361
McGrady was about to toss
him back into prison.

18:37.395 --> 18:39.463
This man called McGrady
three times over the last week,

18:39.497 --> 18:41.532
and was on the phone with him
two hours before he got popped.

18:41.566 --> 18:44.334
All right. Grab Halsted,
find this Briggs, bring him in.

18:44.369 --> 18:47.137
Let's not back off Kane though.
Do some digging.

18:47.172 --> 18:50.307
- Check his alibi.
- All right.

18:50.341 --> 18:53.210
You're a hard man to find, Damon.

18:53.244 --> 18:54.878
Why you hiding?

18:54.913 --> 18:57.781
G, I'm just trying to see
Sunday morning.

18:57.816 --> 19:00.150
White cop killed in my hood.

19:00.185 --> 19:02.052
I'm the brother beefin' with him.

19:02.087 --> 19:04.054
Yeah, I did the math.

19:04.089 --> 19:05.689
Where were you last night, 10:00 p.m.?

19:05.724 --> 19:09.393
I drove to Wisconsin.
Good for the tires.

19:09.427 --> 19:12.196
Got gas. Came right back.

19:12.230 --> 19:13.731
Great alibi.

19:13.765 --> 19:17.334
When was the last time
you spoke with McGrady?

19:17.368 --> 19:20.504
A month. Two. Been a minute.

19:22.707 --> 19:24.408
What about when you called him yesterday

19:24.442 --> 19:25.909
on his undercover phone?

19:25.944 --> 19:27.377
Oh. That was personal.

19:27.412 --> 19:29.413
I thought y'all was talkin' business.

19:29.447 --> 19:32.249
I lent him a grand.
Hadn't paid me back yet.

19:32.283 --> 19:34.918
You know that's why we was conflictin'.

19:34.953 --> 19:37.354
I think dude was in
with some serious people.

19:37.388 --> 19:38.756
Know what I'm saying?

19:38.790 --> 19:40.090
Did he say why he needed the money?

19:40.125 --> 19:41.725
He didn't have to.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.594
We spent most of our time
talking Vegas odds.

19:43.628 --> 19:46.764
Far as I can tell, he wouldn't
pass up a sports bet.

19:46.798 --> 19:49.533
Dude was betting on little league games.

19:51.369 --> 19:53.237
Stay in town, Damon. We'll be in touch.

19:53.271 --> 19:55.339
I ain't going nowhere.

19:59.410 --> 20:00.911
You believe this guy?

20:00.945 --> 20:03.280
- I do.
- Why?

20:03.314 --> 20:05.415
The money thing. Makes sense.

20:07.418 --> 20:10.354
McGrady asked me to borrow
a few grand last month.

20:10.388 --> 20:11.889
You lent him money?

20:11.923 --> 20:14.792
I didn't say I lent him
money. I said he asked.

20:14.826 --> 20:17.628
He sounded like he was
in a really bad place.

20:17.662 --> 20:18.962
How bad?

20:18.997 --> 20:23.133
Well, he likes to gamble.
And he loses a lot.

20:23.168 --> 20:25.135
There's a lot of potential
suspects here.

20:25.170 --> 20:26.603
All right. Let's follow up

20:26.638 --> 20:28.872
on Briggs' alleged trip to Wisconsin.

20:30.341 --> 20:33.076
That's Kane. End of the bar.

20:33.111 --> 20:34.945
This could be another night.

20:34.979 --> 20:37.781
Right. I mean, my grandma
can click a mouse

20:37.816 --> 20:39.483
and change the date on this thing.

20:39.517 --> 20:41.051
I didn't change nothing.

20:41.085 --> 20:43.487
That's the 10:00 news running
behind him on the TV.

20:43.521 --> 20:45.823
Do yourself a favor and find
another black man to arrest.

20:45.857 --> 20:47.457
Kane was here.

20:47.492 --> 20:49.493
Right. In the bar he owns.
Did you work that night?

20:49.527 --> 20:51.261
Yeah I did. I saw him.

20:51.296 --> 20:52.996
And I'd testify to any judge you name.

20:53.031 --> 20:57.334
I'm sure you'd be paid
handsomely for it too.

20:57.368 --> 20:59.736
Have a good night, handsome.

21:03.808 --> 21:06.109
All right. What do we got
on our snitch Briggs?

21:06.144 --> 21:08.812
He totally was on a joy ride
going to scenic Wisconsin.

21:08.847 --> 21:10.647
Credit card receipts,
gas station surveillance

21:10.682 --> 21:12.683
puts him at a Kenosha gas
station at the same time

21:12.717 --> 21:13.984
McGrady was shot.

21:14.018 --> 21:15.419
All right, so cross Briggs off the list.

21:15.453 --> 21:16.820
Where are we at with Kane?

21:16.855 --> 21:18.856
Sarge, Kane's alibi checks out.

21:18.890 --> 21:21.358
Yeah, we got Kane on surveillance video

21:21.392 --> 21:23.160
at 10:21 entering the dive bar.

21:23.194 --> 21:25.195
He owns that place.
You sure that video's legit?

21:25.230 --> 21:27.030
Looks credible.

21:27.065 --> 21:29.433
They got the 10:00 news on in
the background. It checks out.

21:29.467 --> 21:31.468
All right, we know McGrady's 911 call

21:31.502 --> 21:33.203
came in at 10:11, right?

21:33.238 --> 21:35.339
So how far is the dive bar
from where McGrady got hit?

21:35.373 --> 21:38.208
We basically just drove that
route. It was about 4.8 miles.

21:38.243 --> 21:40.644
We were driving fast.
It took us about 27 minutes.

21:40.678 --> 21:42.546
There's no way in hell
he made that in ten.

21:42.580 --> 21:45.215
All right. Just talked to the techs.

21:45.250 --> 21:47.017
Blood on the gun that killed McGrady

21:47.051 --> 21:50.554
is a match for Quinton Kane.

21:50.588 --> 21:54.825
Well blood is blood.
Let's arrest this prick.

22:07.294 --> 22:10.150
Quinton Kane! Chicago PD! Open up!

22:10.184 --> 22:11.752
Quinton ain't here.

22:11.786 --> 22:14.201
We'll see about that. Wait there.

22:14.226 --> 22:15.842
- I got two kids!
- Now hold up!

22:15.877 --> 22:17.301
Y'all can't just come
up in here like this.

22:17.326 --> 22:19.419
- Clear!
- Don't need to take all y'all.

22:19.447 --> 22:22.249
- Kitchen's clear!
- Clear.

22:22.283 --> 22:23.783
Clear.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.520
No sign of Kane, but I found something.

22:27.568 --> 22:30.770
Oh. That's a parole violation.

22:30.812 --> 22:32.713
Straight to the pokey, no hearing.

22:32.748 --> 22:34.782
It ain't mine. I don't do drugs.

22:34.816 --> 22:36.317
Okay. Look at me. We can help you out,

22:36.351 --> 22:38.052
but we need to know where Quinton is.

22:38.086 --> 22:39.553
Oh so you want me to rat out
the father of my children?

22:39.588 --> 22:40.821
No we want you to rat out the guy

22:40.856 --> 22:42.490
who just killed a police officer.

22:42.524 --> 22:46.227
He had kids too.
Four and six. Real cute.

22:46.261 --> 22:47.561
Come on.

22:47.596 --> 22:49.130
Quinton was here last night.

22:49.164 --> 22:51.799
- He came to get his guns.
- Was he with anyone?

22:51.833 --> 22:53.401
He left with his friend Bay Bay.

22:53.435 --> 22:56.003
- Where did they go?
- He didn't say.

22:57.873 --> 23:00.241
But I never seen Quinton
act like that before.

23:00.275 --> 23:02.076
- Act like what?
- Scared.

23:02.110 --> 23:05.479
He knows y'all are looking to
kill him over that white cop.

23:09.718 --> 23:11.552
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:11.586 --> 23:14.822
I've got the 21st district tact
team sitting on every location

23:14.856 --> 23:18.159
Kane's known to frequent.
Aunties, cousins, grandmas.

23:18.193 --> 23:19.760
So far, nothing.

23:19.795 --> 23:21.929
Yeah, us too. Dumped his
phone, ran his credit cards.

23:21.964 --> 23:24.432
He's off the grid, unless
he's using a new burner.

23:24.466 --> 23:28.336
How you holding up? I hear
Voight came down pretty hard.

23:28.370 --> 23:30.404
If you ask me, he was out of line.

23:30.439 --> 23:31.906
I did everything by the book.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.674
It's not my fault McGrady
wanted to play cowboy.

23:33.709 --> 23:35.443
If I were you, I'd keep that to myself.

23:35.477 --> 23:37.845
Everyone's a little raw to hear
your side of the story.

23:37.879 --> 23:40.014
Hey, we got a lead
on Kane's boy Bay Bay.

23:40.048 --> 23:42.350
He was spotted in a stash house
on South Wolcott.

23:42.384 --> 23:43.784
Let's go.

23:43.819 --> 23:47.188
Chicago PD! Don't move!
Get your hands up!

23:47.222 --> 23:50.024
Everybody hands up! Everybody hands up!

23:50.058 --> 23:52.193
- Move through, move through.
- Hands up! Get up!

23:52.227 --> 23:53.761
Let me see 'em up.

23:53.795 --> 23:56.030
Put your hands in the air
now! Do it now!

23:56.064 --> 23:58.799
Hey! Where you going? Drop
the bag, get the hands high.

23:58.834 --> 24:01.202
Come on. Drop the damn bag,
baby. Don't make me do it.

24:01.236 --> 24:03.437
Drop the bag! Turn around!

24:03.472 --> 24:05.473
Don't look at me. Here you go.

24:05.507 --> 24:07.141
Come on. Come on back, Bay Bay.

24:07.175 --> 24:09.210
This your house, you know where to go.

24:09.244 --> 24:12.079
Hands up. Face on the fridge.
Come on! Let's do it, Bay Bay!

24:12.114 --> 24:14.582
Hands high! There you go!

24:14.616 --> 24:16.650
Hey, where'd you get this?
Playing checkers?

24:16.685 --> 24:18.953
Huh? If you tell us
where Quinton Kane is,

24:18.987 --> 24:20.788
we can forget all about that cash, bro.

24:20.822 --> 24:22.156
Hey, man. I ain't seen him in days.

24:22.190 --> 24:24.125
We know you helped him get away.

24:24.159 --> 24:26.727
Yeah, sounds like you were
harboring a cop killer to me.

24:26.762 --> 24:29.230
- We taking you in.
- Get your hands off me, boy!

24:29.264 --> 24:30.898
- Hey!
- The hell's wrong with you?

24:30.932 --> 24:32.333
- We good?
- Yeah, we good. I got him.

24:32.367 --> 24:33.801
Hands behind your back.

24:33.835 --> 24:35.503
See we ain't playing with you, bro.

24:35.537 --> 24:37.772
All right? Talk to me about
Quinton Kane right now.

24:37.806 --> 24:39.507
Man, I dropped him off
around 65th and Loomis.

24:39.541 --> 24:41.142
- When was that?
- Like two hours ago.

24:41.176 --> 24:43.010
You sure about that?
You ain't seen him since?

24:43.045 --> 24:45.166
- Kane called, like, 15 minutes ago.
- Yeah.

24:45.191 --> 24:47.815
He told me to gather
as much cash as possible,

24:47.849 --> 24:49.917
and that he would call me back
later with the meeting spot.

24:49.951 --> 24:51.519
- He called you?
- Yeah.

24:51.553 --> 24:52.787
- You got phone?
- It's in my pocket, bro.

24:52.821 --> 24:54.522
- In your jacket?
- Yeah.

24:54.556 --> 24:58.325
Man, get on your knees.
Get down on your knees, baby.

24:58.360 --> 25:00.161
Okay.

25:00.195 --> 25:03.030
These look like government
extensions to me, bro.

25:03.065 --> 25:05.666
Kane probably has somebody
on the inside.

25:11.573 --> 25:13.374
What the hell is going on?

25:13.408 --> 25:15.543
Hank, come on in. I was just
about to call you.

25:15.577 --> 25:17.778
Why are you talking to Quinton Kane?

25:17.813 --> 25:21.015
Because I'm trying to save his life.

25:21.049 --> 25:23.717
Okay, I reached out to some
of Kane's associates

25:23.752 --> 25:26.620
and told them that he needed
to surrender peacefully.

25:26.655 --> 25:28.722
And I said that
I would help so he called me.

25:28.757 --> 25:30.391
Where is he?

25:30.425 --> 25:33.561
Before I share that with you,
we need to discuss process.

25:33.595 --> 25:36.464
Listen to me.

25:36.498 --> 25:38.232
This is a police operation.

25:38.266 --> 25:40.334
We will take him down our own way.

25:40.368 --> 25:42.736
He won't come in your way.
I promise you that.

25:42.771 --> 25:46.373
The best approach is for you
and me to go in together.

25:46.408 --> 25:48.476
Ray, that is not a good idea.

25:48.510 --> 25:51.245
He claims he's innocent,
and he wants a fair trial.

25:51.279 --> 25:53.180
Quinton's no dummy.

25:53.215 --> 25:54.982
He knows that if he
blinks the wrong way,

25:55.016 --> 25:56.750
the men in blue are gonna light
his ass up

25:56.785 --> 25:58.819
like a Christmas tree,
which as we just discussed,

25:58.854 --> 26:00.654
is no good for anyone.

26:21.476 --> 26:24.678
- You all right?
- Yeah.

26:26.248 --> 26:28.349
Don't worry, Ray. I got your back.

26:28.383 --> 26:31.185
Yeah. I appreciate it.

26:31.219 --> 26:33.187
Those country boys
up there with the guns,

26:33.221 --> 26:36.524
they know the suspect is tall
and thin, right?

26:36.558 --> 26:38.225
I believe they do.

26:41.396 --> 26:43.097
It's cool.

26:54.676 --> 26:56.310
Should be down at the end of the hall.

26:56.344 --> 26:58.546
All right. I'll go in first,
you stay behind me.

26:58.580 --> 26:59.914
Let me see those hands up high.

26:59.948 --> 27:02.116
No! Quinton!

27:02.150 --> 27:04.385
- I'm not carrying.
- Raise your hands!

27:04.419 --> 27:06.820
Quinton, you have my word.
Calm down now.

27:06.855 --> 27:08.322
Come on now, Quinton.

27:08.356 --> 27:10.724
- You have my word. Calm down.
- Turn around.

27:11.993 --> 27:13.460
I didn't shoot that cop.

27:13.495 --> 27:15.896
Yeah, well, I'm not here
to discuss the case.

27:15.931 --> 27:17.298
You know why I'm here?

27:17.332 --> 27:19.099
To make sure you get out of here alive,

27:19.134 --> 27:20.901
get a chance to tell
your side of the story.

27:20.936 --> 27:22.503
Are you saying you don't believe me?

27:22.537 --> 27:24.271
I'm saying it doesn't matter
what I believe.

27:24.306 --> 27:26.006
If you're innocent, Quinton,
put down the gun,

27:26.041 --> 27:28.175
walk out with us, and
no one's gonna hurt you.

27:28.210 --> 27:29.577
Nah.

27:29.611 --> 27:30.811
Nah, not yet. Not yet.

27:30.845 --> 27:32.179
I'm gonna wait 'til I'm outside.

27:32.214 --> 27:34.081
So everybody can see
that I'm cooperating.

27:34.115 --> 27:36.283
You're cooperating?

27:40.322 --> 27:41.422
Let's go.

27:46.127 --> 27:48.862
Are you ready? Here you go.

27:48.897 --> 27:50.331
We're coming out. Don't shoot.

27:50.365 --> 27:53.167
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

27:53.201 --> 27:55.469
Hey, stand down! Stand down!

27:55.503 --> 27:58.839
Put your guns... Put your guns down!

27:58.873 --> 28:02.476
Hey! We are all gonna walk
out of here alive.

28:02.510 --> 28:04.378
Every one of us.

28:04.412 --> 28:05.879
Put your weapon down.

28:05.914 --> 28:08.282
All right, Quinton. You too.

28:08.316 --> 28:09.950
Calm down, Quinton. I got it.

28:09.985 --> 28:11.385
- Come on.
- You got my word, Quinton.

28:11.419 --> 28:12.886
You want to walk out of here
in one piece?

28:12.921 --> 28:14.355
Come on. Look at this.

28:14.389 --> 28:15.856
- You got my word.
- Come on. Be smart.

28:15.890 --> 28:17.625
Come on, man.

28:17.659 --> 28:18.993
There you go.

28:19.027 --> 28:21.662
There you go! Come on in.

28:21.696 --> 28:23.497
All right, turn around. Turn around.

28:23.531 --> 28:27.234
- Put your hands up.
- You got my word.

28:27.269 --> 28:30.871
Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on.

28:50.175 --> 28:52.109
- Thanks, Ray.
- Thank you.

29:00.344 --> 29:02.421
Tonight, Chicago sleeps safer.

29:03.124 --> 29:05.123
Quinton Kane is in custody
for the murder

29:05.148 --> 29:07.398
of a Chicago police officer.

29:07.850 --> 29:11.027
I was very close with
Sergeant Sean McGrady.

29:11.059 --> 29:15.402
He was everything that
we as police strive to be.

29:16.707 --> 29:19.204
He was honest. He was dedicated.

29:20.327 --> 29:21.828
He was courageous.

29:23.397 --> 29:28.639
We must never forget
Sergeant McGrady's sacrifice.

29:29.346 --> 29:30.413
Thank you.

29:32.303 --> 29:33.655
Hey.

29:35.225 --> 29:38.092
You sent in a tactical
team without telling me?

29:38.212 --> 29:41.381
- We got our man.
- We already had our man.

29:41.773 --> 29:43.507
You just needed to get the credit.

29:43.545 --> 29:44.678
Well, I needed to make sure

29:44.712 --> 29:46.180
we apprehended a cop killer,

29:46.214 --> 29:48.582
and that we got you
and Ray out of there alive.

29:48.616 --> 29:50.350
That was my only agenda.

29:50.385 --> 29:53.481
Well, that's good to know,
'cause for a minute there,

29:54.015 --> 29:56.066
it felt personal.

30:04.399 --> 30:07.034
Pick up your feet, please.

30:07.068 --> 30:09.369
Thank you.

30:09.404 --> 30:12.439
All right. You first.

30:12.474 --> 30:13.974
Anne.

30:16.411 --> 30:18.078
I'll be just a minute.

30:26.421 --> 30:31.391
If there's anything that
you need, you, the kids,

30:31.426 --> 30:33.227
please call me.

30:34.262 --> 30:36.864
Thanks. I appreciate that.

30:36.898 --> 30:40.467
And I'm... I'm sorry
about the other day.

30:40.502 --> 30:42.536
I didn't mean to be so abrupt.

30:42.570 --> 30:45.239
- It's all right.
- I just...

30:45.273 --> 30:47.941
Mac really liked you.

30:47.976 --> 30:50.244
He always said how smart you were.

30:52.313 --> 30:54.882
That's nice to know.

30:54.916 --> 30:57.718
Anything you need, let me know.

30:58.319 --> 31:03.257
Actually there is something
I would like to address.

31:03.291 --> 31:05.459
Yeah. Name it.

31:05.493 --> 31:11.265
It seems so meaningless now,
but I can't let it go.

31:11.299 --> 31:14.601
Mac came home from
Community Play one night...

31:14.636 --> 31:17.337
really upset.

31:17.372 --> 31:21.475
The treasurer accused Mac
of stealing money.

31:21.509 --> 31:24.077
That's terrible.

31:25.880 --> 31:29.116
Do you remember the guy's name?

31:29.150 --> 31:30.651
Mike Adams.

31:32.353 --> 31:34.788
There were some checks made out to cash.

31:34.822 --> 31:36.924
It looked like Sergeant McGrady
was responsible.

31:36.958 --> 31:39.626
Hm. You thought he was stealing money?

31:39.661 --> 31:43.530
- Yes.
- How much money was missing?

31:43.565 --> 31:45.866
Close to $10,000.

31:45.900 --> 31:49.036
I told him we were going
to file a police report.

31:49.070 --> 31:50.437
Is that what you were fighting about

31:50.471 --> 31:51.471
the night of the party?

31:51.506 --> 31:52.906
Mm-hmm.

31:55.677 --> 31:57.177
I assume after everything
that's happened

31:57.212 --> 32:00.180
that you're gonna let this go now?

32:00.215 --> 32:02.349
Of course.

32:02.383 --> 32:07.554
Especially now,
after the case is closed.

32:07.589 --> 32:09.856
Killer's in custody.

32:11.092 --> 32:15.128
You know I read they found
his blood on McGrady's gun?

32:15.163 --> 32:17.030
Sounds like a no-brainer.

32:18.700 --> 32:21.101
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

32:25.206 --> 32:27.507
Hey. Detective Upton, Intelligence.

32:27.542 --> 32:29.676
I have two cases on the docket today.

32:39.587 --> 32:44.858
I found something important.
We need to talk about it now.

32:56.437 --> 32:58.105
Got your message.

32:58.139 --> 33:00.340
You'll wanna check this out.

33:01.743 --> 33:03.710
Okay, an ISP sign-in sheet.

33:03.745 --> 33:06.213
That's McGrady's signature.

33:06.247 --> 33:07.714
So?

33:07.749 --> 33:10.217
Quinton Kane was popped
for a DUI two months ago.

33:10.251 --> 33:13.086
His blood's been sitting
in an evidence cooler.

33:13.121 --> 33:15.789
One of the vials is missing.

33:15.823 --> 33:18.592
You're saying McGrady
stole Kane's blood?

33:18.626 --> 33:20.894
- Yep.
- Why?

33:20.928 --> 33:23.563
So he could frame him.

33:23.598 --> 33:24.898
Frame him for his own murder?

33:24.932 --> 33:28.068
No. Frame him for his own suicide.

33:34.714 --> 33:36.681
I hear the funeral is today.

33:36.715 --> 33:39.331
Yep. Starts in an hour.

33:39.425 --> 33:42.761
I'm sure McGrady is gonna
get a hell of a send-off.

33:42.995 --> 33:47.241
Those bagpipes always make me tremble.

33:47.399 --> 33:49.434
"Coming Home."

33:49.468 --> 33:51.135
Everyone thinks it's Scottish.

33:51.170 --> 33:53.538
It's actually an
African-American spiritual.

33:53.572 --> 33:55.907
I didn't know that.

33:55.941 --> 33:58.309
Things are never what they seem.

33:58.344 --> 34:00.078
Huh.

34:00.112 --> 34:02.246
You know, I heard a rumor
that McGrady was stealing cash

34:02.281 --> 34:04.115
from Community Play.

34:04.149 --> 34:06.884
That's news to me.

34:06.919 --> 34:09.304
I'm just thinking aloud here. Musing.

34:09.375 --> 34:11.876
- Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong.
- Okay.

34:11.909 --> 34:15.713
McGrady's circling the drain,
knows he's about to be exposed.

34:15.748 --> 34:19.684
So he frames a black drug
dealer for his own suicide.

34:19.717 --> 34:23.721
He goes out a hero,
and his wife and kids,

34:23.755 --> 34:26.690
they get to collect a healthy pension.

34:26.725 --> 34:28.192
That sounds far-fetched.

34:28.226 --> 34:32.397
I also heard
there's a surveillance video

34:32.431 --> 34:35.400
of Kane drinking whiskey at
a bar damn near the same time

34:35.434 --> 34:37.268
McGrady got shot.

34:37.303 --> 34:38.503
Hmm.

34:38.536 --> 34:40.905
Until last night, that is.

34:40.938 --> 34:44.342
When someone broke into the bar,

34:44.376 --> 34:46.610
and the video disappears.

34:46.645 --> 34:51.382
Yeah, well, now it's my turn to muse.

34:51.417 --> 34:54.851
You don't care about Kane.
I mean, not even a little.

34:54.887 --> 34:56.554
He's an old-fashioned criminal.

34:56.588 --> 34:58.289
Doesn't believe in paying tribute

34:58.324 --> 35:00.358
to enlightened aldermen.

35:00.392 --> 35:02.360
No.

35:02.394 --> 35:05.229
And with Kane gone,

35:05.264 --> 35:07.932
another banger's going to
take over that territory,

35:07.966 --> 35:13.771
and I think with
the correct help, guidance,

35:13.806 --> 35:15.873
he'll come to understand the wisdom

35:15.908 --> 35:18.843
of investing in his ward.

35:22.781 --> 35:25.783
Maybe you're right.

35:25.818 --> 35:28.920
But that doesn't mean
my silence is free.

35:30.622 --> 35:35.159
Ray, Ray. What is it that you want?

35:35.194 --> 35:37.662
What do I want? What do I want?

35:37.696 --> 35:41.699
I want you to remember.

35:43.669 --> 35:45.069
I'm doing you a favor.

35:45.104 --> 35:47.605
That's it. That's all I'm asking.

35:51.610 --> 35:53.778
I'm gonna talk to you soon, Hank.

35:53.812 --> 35:56.614
No doubt.

36:04.156 --> 36:06.424
There should be more cops like Mac.

36:06.458 --> 36:09.260
Yeah. We used to play horse
over at Community Play.

36:09.294 --> 36:10.461
I always kicked his ass.

36:10.496 --> 36:12.263
Well, you know he let you win.

36:12.297 --> 36:14.832
Exactly what I wanted him to think.

36:14.867 --> 36:17.068
All right.

36:18.003 --> 36:20.304
How's Upton dealing with all of this?

36:20.339 --> 36:23.007
I'm not sure. She keeps a lot in.

36:24.643 --> 36:28.312
We all do, right? It's part of the job.

36:30.482 --> 36:31.949
Call from Mia, huh?

36:31.984 --> 36:35.620
- She ain't playing with you.
- Hello?

36:35.654 --> 36:37.288
When?

36:41.527 --> 36:43.528
Yeah, I can be there in an hour.

36:43.562 --> 36:45.496
Not easy raising kids on your own.

36:45.531 --> 36:48.966
Hey, guys. Can you go upstairs, please?

36:49.001 --> 36:50.835
She's a strong woman.

36:50.869 --> 36:53.171
She's got lots of friends.

36:53.205 --> 36:56.140
If anyone can pull it off, she can.

36:56.175 --> 36:57.942
Mm.

37:04.583 --> 37:07.485
Hailey. Hailey, hold up.

37:08.887 --> 37:11.055
So I know I came down
kind of hard on you

37:11.089 --> 37:15.092
about this coffee thing,
letting McGrady go in alone.

37:15.127 --> 37:18.996
- Well, I get it now, so.
- It's not really

37:19.031 --> 37:21.332
what you want to talk to me
about though, is it?

37:23.235 --> 37:25.870
You and me gotta get on the same page.

37:27.139 --> 37:29.006
Either we disclose this evidence,

37:29.041 --> 37:31.142
or we take it to the grave.

37:33.078 --> 37:36.280
Wait. Doesn't it bother you
that everyone looks at him

37:36.315 --> 37:37.515
like he's a hero?

37:39.885 --> 37:42.053
Yeah. It bothers me.

37:44.223 --> 37:47.458
- McGrady was a good man.
- Mm.

37:47.493 --> 37:49.861
Good cop? Sure.

37:49.895 --> 37:53.731
Good man? No. Not so much.

37:53.765 --> 37:55.633
He gambled away his savings,

37:55.667 --> 37:57.568
he cheated on Anne,

37:57.603 --> 37:59.370
tried to sabotage my career.

37:59.404 --> 38:01.873
Every time I was up for a promotion,

38:01.907 --> 38:04.275
son of a bitch did his best
to jam me up.

38:04.309 --> 38:06.244
I know.

38:06.278 --> 38:08.980
He wasn't perfect.

38:09.014 --> 38:11.082
But he was a good cop.
I know that for sure,

38:11.116 --> 38:13.584
'cause I saw him in action.

38:13.619 --> 38:16.387
I watched what he did
when the bullets were flying,

38:16.421 --> 38:19.156
and believe me...

38:19.191 --> 38:24.862
Hailey, he's got two little kids.

38:27.366 --> 38:31.168
Think about what happens
to them if this comes out.

38:31.203 --> 38:34.472
All they have is his legacy.

38:34.506 --> 38:37.975
And his pension.

38:38.010 --> 38:43.114
I mean, you want to blow
all of that over some jackass

38:43.148 --> 38:44.949
who mowed down a family of three

38:44.983 --> 38:47.084
over a couple kilos of coke?

38:51.156 --> 38:52.590
Hey.

38:56.161 --> 39:00.798
This city could use a hero
in blue right now.

39:00.832 --> 39:03.801
Someone the people could admire.

39:03.835 --> 39:06.437
Even if he's a fraud?

39:17.182 --> 39:19.483
Okay.

39:19.518 --> 39:21.319
To the grave.

39:33.031 --> 39:35.800
Thanks for finally taking my call.

39:35.834 --> 39:37.368
I've been a bit busy.

39:37.402 --> 39:39.337
Yeah, well, you don't get to be busy.

39:39.371 --> 39:44.141
Or unavailable. You understand?

39:44.176 --> 39:46.310
Like I told you last week,

39:46.345 --> 39:48.112
I own you.

39:49.514 --> 39:52.350
The second your sister got
popped for that DUI

39:52.384 --> 39:54.685
with your little nephew in the backseat,

39:54.720 --> 39:57.154
you tried to make it all go away,

39:57.189 --> 40:01.559
your right to being
agitated or inconvenienced

40:01.593 --> 40:03.260
came to an abrupt end.

40:03.295 --> 40:05.763
You falsified official reports.

40:05.797 --> 40:08.099
Buried evidence.

40:08.133 --> 40:13.337
Hell, if I weren't so open-minded,

40:13.372 --> 40:15.673
you could go to jail over this.

40:21.747 --> 40:23.848
What do you want?

40:23.882 --> 40:26.884
Your eyes. Your ears.

40:26.918 --> 40:29.854
No. Uh-uh. No.

40:29.888 --> 40:31.889
I'm not a rat, man.

40:31.923 --> 40:34.558
No? You don't think so?

40:34.593 --> 40:35.993
No.

40:39.264 --> 40:42.199
That's my dear friend from IAD.

40:43.402 --> 40:45.369
But if you don't want to play...

40:52.244 --> 40:55.279
I just call his cranky ass right now.

41:04.790 --> 41:06.691
Hang it up.

41:09.661 --> 41:12.643
There you go, son.
That's a good decision.

41:13.598 --> 41:16.067
Now let's talk details.
