WEBVTT

01:56.115 --> 01:57.356
- Long day ahead.

03:11.828 --> 03:12.860
Aileen?

03:14.336 --> 03:15.368
Thanks, love.

03:18.230 --> 03:21.275
- More like
donkeys broken in, Mary.

03:21.277 --> 03:24.542
Fuck's sake, like,
we could have been anything.

03:24.544 --> 03:29.481
Teachers, nurses, hairdressers.

03:29.483 --> 03:34.244
Hairdressers?
Don't be so ambitious, Sarah.

03:34.246 --> 03:37.885
Did you not just hear her
calling us donkeys?
Actual asses, like.

03:37.887 --> 03:40.426
-But what an arse, Sheila, girl.

03:57.269 --> 04:00.413
- My son!

04:00.910 --> 04:02.415
No!

04:04.276 --> 04:05.616
No!

04:05.618 --> 04:08.784
Mark!

05:52.054 --> 05:55.462
If I do nothing else,
I'm teaching this little fecker
how to swim.

05:55.464 --> 05:56.694
- Erin.

05:56.696 --> 05:58.355
Jesus Christ, girl.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.225
Yera...

06:00.227 --> 06:02.161
for fuck's sake.
They literally live on the water

06:02.163 --> 06:03.470
and none of them learn how.

06:03.472 --> 06:05.395
You know
it's the tradition, Erin.

06:05.397 --> 06:08.068
What, it's bad luck to know?

06:08.070 --> 06:12.072
If they can't swim,
they won't jump in
and help anyone else.

06:12.074 --> 06:14.976
Pack of selfish wankers,
too worried
about their own skins.

06:14.978 --> 06:17.242
-What's wrong, Oscar, love?

06:19.081 --> 06:21.114
Wakes up crying three,
four times a night.

06:21.116 --> 06:24.084
-Disaster, like.
-Jesus Christ,
I remember nights with you.

06:24.086 --> 06:25.789
Could never sleep.

06:25.791 --> 06:28.253
Con telling me
I just had to let you cry.

06:28.255 --> 06:29.419
How could I do that?

06:29.421 --> 06:32.499
-Hearing every noise.

06:32.501 --> 06:34.633
You were the easier child,
to be fair.

07:11.034 --> 07:13.232
- How's it going?
I haven't see you in a while.

07:13.234 --> 07:14.266
How's things?

07:15.269 --> 07:16.840
Good to see you.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.678
Hi, Dan.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.339
Brian O'Hara? What the hell
are you doing here?

07:21.341 --> 07:22.813
Jesus Christ, the size of you.

07:22.815 --> 07:24.243
The stronger you get...
Come here.

07:24.245 --> 07:26.179
- We're all wider
and wiser by the look Dan boy.

07:26.181 --> 07:28.489
-After a while.
-Well boy, how's things?

07:32.561 --> 07:33.725
Brian.

07:34.794 --> 07:37.256
-Christ, Brian...

07:42.736 --> 07:44.901
Mom, look at you, huh.

07:44.903 --> 07:47.838
-Your hair.
You haven't changed a bit.

07:51.613 --> 07:52.876
- Who's this, huh?

07:54.473 --> 07:55.714
It's my baby brother, is it?

07:55.716 --> 07:57.881
What! No, no, no.
Jesus Christ.

07:57.883 --> 07:59.245
Oh, come here to me.

07:59.247 --> 08:01.654
Oh.

08:01.656 --> 08:03.150
Well, Paddy, how's things?

08:03.152 --> 08:05.185
- You son of a bitch.

08:05.187 --> 08:07.319
-Brian!
-- Erin!

08:07.321 --> 08:09.519
What the fuck!
What are you doing here?

08:09.521 --> 08:11.290
It's 'bout time
I came back, isn't it?

08:13.294 --> 08:15.833
-- Sarah.
-Brian.

08:15.835 --> 08:18.638
- It takes Mark Fitz dying
for you to come back
to us, does it?

08:19.201 --> 08:20.332
What?

08:22.237 --> 08:23.577
That's who this is for?

08:24.811 --> 08:26.437
Ah, fuck me, it is.

08:28.848 --> 08:29.946
I'm so sorry.

08:34.018 --> 08:35.556
Just give me one second.

08:37.923 --> 08:39.087
Mary, um...

08:40.629 --> 08:42.695
I'm so sorry, Mary.

08:42.697 --> 08:44.697
-I'm so sorry.
-- Thank you.

08:59.340 --> 09:00.944
How long has Paddy
been like this?

09:03.080 --> 09:05.014
A good few years now
at this stage.

09:06.886 --> 09:09.249
-Must be weird being back.
-Hmm.

09:09.251 --> 09:11.020
Probably the exact fuckin' same,
though, is it?

09:13.222 --> 09:15.189
- Does she ever stop going?

09:15.191 --> 09:17.895
- Oh, not a second
all the time you were gone.

09:20.669 --> 09:21.932
- One minute, love.

09:29.271 --> 09:31.601
- That dad, is it?

09:31.603 --> 09:34.472
You should go out and meet him.
He'd like that.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.441
Go on.

09:51.161 --> 09:53.227
-You good?
-Oh yeah, yeah.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.674
- Strange seeing them
shake hands.

10:00.676 --> 10:04.172
He's different,
isn't he? Grown into himself.

10:04.845 --> 10:05.976
Do you reckon?

10:07.540 --> 10:09.408
- A mother knows.

10:18.254 --> 10:19.616
The look on your face.

10:21.092 --> 10:23.125
-Don't be so shocked, mate.
-What?

10:24.964 --> 10:27.459
-- Has she fed you?
-- Uh, no. Not yet.

10:30.266 --> 10:31.771
- Hard to believe
he's home, huh?

10:33.632 --> 10:35.368
Good to be home now, all right.

10:38.175 --> 10:41.308
So, you're in Australia.

10:41.310 --> 10:44.509
Not been in touch
with us in how long?

10:44.511 --> 10:48.150
And you get a notion,
all of a sudden, to come home.

10:48.152 --> 10:52.858
Shit weather, fuck all work,
and not tell anyone?

10:54.125 --> 10:56.763
Yeah. That's about
the size of it, yeah.

10:56.765 --> 10:59.062
Come on, why are you back, like?

11:01.330 --> 11:02.362
Uh...

11:03.332 --> 11:04.364
Paddy's oysters.

11:07.039 --> 11:11.371
Christ. Oh, you be starting
from nothing again.
Have you money saved?

11:12.473 --> 11:15.012
Oysters take work.
They aren't cheap.

11:16.818 --> 11:18.543
But we still have
the license for it.

11:19.854 --> 11:21.249
I kept up the payments.

11:23.154 --> 11:25.319
Every year
since Con gave up on it.

11:27.422 --> 11:28.586
Just in case.

11:57.023 --> 12:00.453
-Tilt it forward.
-Okay.

12:00.455 --> 12:04.160
-- Is it that way?
-Yes.

12:04.162 --> 12:05.722
-- That all right?
-Yeah.

13:13.594 --> 13:15.165
- I see
you looked after it.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.663
- My father
wasn't able for it anymore,

13:20.238 --> 13:23.107
and you were gone
and stayed gone.

13:23.109 --> 13:25.175
That was that. No other option.

13:26.981 --> 13:28.915
Didn't want to work it
with anyone else.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.887
Jesus Christ, it's unreal.

13:33.889 --> 13:36.021
- Ground's
a bit soft in parts.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.188
You'll have to replace
some of your trestles.

13:38.190 --> 13:40.388
Find a supplier
for your oysters and bags.

13:41.490 --> 13:43.853
Start with seeds
or half-growns, then.

13:43.855 --> 13:47.329
Be a year at least
before they mature, turn profit.

13:47.331 --> 13:48.968
You'll have to find
another income.

13:50.466 --> 13:53.236
But you know that yourself.

13:53.238 --> 13:56.107
That's nothing
you can't manage,
though, Brian. Is it?

13:56.109 --> 13:58.538
Not a bother.
For fuck's sake.

14:50.922 --> 14:54.066
Oh, sorry, Aileen.
Forgot to clock out.

14:54.068 --> 14:57.036
-Just give me a minute.
-No rush, love.

15:12.614 --> 15:16.055
- Fine looking oysters.
Thanks, Francie.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.552
Be some craic if they caught us.

15:18.554 --> 15:20.521
-- Oh,
don't say that to me.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.063
Hurry up will you. Come on.

15:24.065 --> 15:25.427
I'm waiting on you, Mom.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.864
-See you for dinner, yeah?
-Go on, aye, go away.

15:43.018 --> 15:44.050
Be safe.

16:43.001 --> 16:44.704
-- Hup!

17:09.236 --> 17:10.631
- Thank you, guys.

17:16.342 --> 17:17.902
Hi, boy, how're things?

17:21.611 --> 17:22.775
- There you are.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.582
Here, take some of this. Go on.

17:27.584 --> 17:29.386
- C'mon. Give us a song.

17:29.388 --> 17:31.080
-Go on.
-Thanks, Mom.

17:31.082 --> 17:32.983
-There you go, Dan.
-- Okay, all right.
I'll do one for you.

17:36.131 --> 17:40.232
<i>♪ We go walking in the dark</i>

17:41.092 --> 17:45.028

What about Australia?

18:11.397 --> 18:13.958

18:13.960 --> 18:17.467

-Hmm.

18:17.469 --> 18:20.470
<i>♪ We can hear each other pass</i>

18:20.472 --> 18:22.307
You'd be surprised
how little I saw of it, Aileen.

18:25.070 --> 18:28.005
If I'd known where you were,
I'd have gone and visited you.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.316
<i>♪ We go walking out at night</i>

18:31.318 --> 18:33.186
That would have
been nice all right, but...

18:34.453 --> 18:36.112
you didn't miss much.

18:36.114 --> 18:38.048
<i>♪ Grass so dark and tall</i>

18:39.656 --> 18:43.592
Besides, it's the

19:20.400 --> 19:22.125
-Where you off to?
-- Could I get another, Dan?

19:22.127 --> 19:24.633
-I'm going for a smoke.
-No, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.

19:24.635 --> 19:26.437
-We've gotta go home.
-No. I don't want to go home.

19:26.439 --> 19:28.406
-I don't care.
-I don't want to go home yet.

19:36.449 --> 19:38.174
Mary, huh?

19:38.176 --> 19:39.252
-- No.
-Come on.

19:49.187 --> 19:50.857
- I'm telling you
the count is low.

19:50.859 --> 19:52.331
- Count them again.

19:52.333 --> 19:54.190
- I counted them twice.
There aren't enough bags.

19:54.192 --> 19:55.631
- You telling me
how to do my job, Francie?

19:55.633 --> 19:56.896
- Someone's
trying to cheat me.

19:56.898 --> 19:58.370
Is it going to come out
of your fucking wages?

19:58.372 --> 20:00.130
- Listen, I'm only
giving you what you asked for.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.868
- Oh, hold on.
You're saying
it has to do with me!

20:01.870 --> 20:04.541
-It's my fault now, is it?
-Hey, hey, what's
the story here, lads?

20:04.543 --> 20:06.004
This little bitch
is trying to cheat me.

20:06.006 --> 20:07.676
Fuck off, Francie.

20:07.678 --> 20:09.513
There isn't
near enough bags there.

20:09.515 --> 20:11.207
Where's the rest
of my fuckin' half-growns?

20:11.209 --> 20:13.880
I'm sure they're all there.
You filled them right,
didn't you?

20:13.882 --> 20:15.420
Can't imagine
how I couldn't have.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.686
I split them the exact same way
as I did last time, like.

20:17.688 --> 20:21.052
Cause you're a moron,
that's why. Is Dennis here?

20:21.054 --> 20:22.724
- I haven't
seen him yet, no.

20:29.601 --> 20:32.272
It's an easy mistake to make,
girl. Go on away quick.

20:52.393 --> 20:54.118
It's crazy inside there,
isn't it?

21:04.130 --> 21:07.164
Shame you and Francie
had to go home early on us
the other night.

21:10.642 --> 21:13.445
I've been taking space,
and he's not been happy
about it.

21:16.846 --> 21:20.353
Wiped my hands of him
after the last night.

21:20.355 --> 21:23.818
But here I am crying my eyes out
as if he's the one
who broke my heart.

21:26.394 --> 21:27.492
Can't help it, though.

21:32.400 --> 21:33.762
Take your time with it.

21:42.938 --> 21:45.301
I've been back
in my parents' house
a couple of nights.

21:51.617 --> 21:54.211
Time puts it all
into perspective very quickly.

21:58.690 --> 22:00.360
He was brutal with his words.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.062
Still, though, he's just
like anyone else really.

22:12.671 --> 22:14.671
We're all God's creatures
in the dark.

23:47.293 --> 23:48.831
- That's four salmon.

23:58.579 --> 23:59.776
Two hundred to you.

24:00.647 --> 24:01.679
- Good man.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.720
-- Thanks.
-Cheers.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.077
- How's work going, Con?

24:41.248 --> 24:43.655
Ah, coining it, I suppose.

24:44.856 --> 24:46.350
Where's this come from?

24:54.459 --> 24:58.604
You think you're
a hard man, do you?
Fighting the system.

24:58.606 --> 25:00.672
Poaching alone,
as if you didn't know better.

25:00.674 --> 25:02.971
It's nothing you didn't do
back in the day, Con.

25:02.973 --> 25:05.468
I never went out
on spring tides.

25:05.470 --> 25:07.107
Sure Mark died
doing the same thing.

25:09.045 --> 25:12.343
And that's either
what will happen to you
eventually, or you'll be caught.

25:12.345 --> 25:15.654
All points to the same end,
like. Stupidity.

25:15.656 --> 25:18.085
Jesus Christ, lighten up, mate.

25:18.087 --> 25:21.726
The bags she stole for you
weren't enough, no?

25:21.728 --> 25:25.323
You lasted all of about how long
making an honest go
of the oysters?

25:25.325 --> 25:27.556
Longer than I reckoned anyway.
Fair play to you.

25:27.558 --> 25:29.635
You keep telling me
what I can and can't do,

25:29.637 --> 25:32.132
but I'm keeping
Paddy's farm going.

25:32.134 --> 25:35.036
Your father's only trying to say
that you don't have to take
such a risk.

25:42.210 --> 25:43.242
Thanks for that, Mom.

26:50.916 --> 26:53.411
What's the story here, lad?

26:53.413 --> 26:55.787
Checking if there isn't anything
I can make use of.

26:58.957 --> 27:00.693
Christ, things are
that bad, are they?

27:02.158 --> 27:03.322
You're like a rat.

27:04.963 --> 27:06.699
Most of this is my old shite.

27:07.768 --> 27:10.329
It's long past being any use.

27:10.331 --> 27:12.936
Invest in a few new things
for yourself.

27:12.938 --> 27:14.773
Give yourself
a chance anyway, boy.

27:17.602 --> 27:19.173
Tell us, what...
what are you doing tomorrow?

27:19.175 --> 27:21.637
Uh...

27:21.639 --> 27:23.573
head out in the evening
after the tide, I'd say.

27:25.313 --> 27:26.752
So, you're free
in the morning, I take it?

27:29.614 --> 27:32.186
Could have a job for you.

27:32.188 --> 27:35.387
I mean, use these away sure
and I could pay you
a bit extra on top.

27:39.624 --> 27:40.733
It's tough, isn't it...

27:42.330 --> 27:43.461
doin' it by yourself?

27:45.971 --> 27:47.432
It's too much, really,
for one man.

27:51.174 --> 27:52.536
It's the lesson
your father learned.

28:31.544 --> 28:33.214
These would fit Brian,
would they?

29:15.225 --> 29:16.587
Are you all right, Mary?

29:20.197 --> 29:24.199
I keep thinking I hear Mark
when I'm here alone.

29:26.940 --> 29:28.467
A sound at night...

29:29.910 --> 29:32.108
and it might be him
moving around the place.

29:35.850 --> 29:37.311
Strange comfort.

29:57.432 --> 29:58.530
Thanks, love.

31:01.661 --> 31:03.760
- Brian,
come out the fuck.
Can you hurry up?

31:25.322 --> 31:26.453
Oh.

31:27.962 --> 31:29.962
-Oh.

31:35.431 --> 31:36.969
Got to keep an eye
on the tide, mate.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.710
- Some morning out there,
Paddy Boy.

32:32.587 --> 32:34.521
Everything supposedly shifts,
but...

32:36.591 --> 32:39.493
it's exactly like it was
when you, me,
and Con were workin' it.

32:48.504 --> 32:50.834
Drinking cold tea
out of a 7UP bottle

32:50.836 --> 32:52.506
on a clear day,
there's nothing like it.

33:00.285 --> 33:01.548
Are you there at all?

33:10.361 --> 33:11.591
Shit...

33:14.827 --> 33:15.859
Fuck...

33:18.732 --> 33:20.369
Dick, bollocks, arse.

33:32.218 --> 33:34.009
You didn't say anything?

33:34.011 --> 33:35.879
I didn't tell him nothing, no.

33:36.981 --> 33:38.816
Nine months later, this fella.

33:41.458 --> 33:43.524
He's a needy little fecker.

33:43.526 --> 33:47.660
The usual family traits.
Boys being boys.

33:47.662 --> 33:49.398
Stuck to their mother's tit.

33:54.339 --> 33:55.866
Lookin' very smart.

33:56.902 --> 33:59.034
Do you want
to come down with us?

33:59.036 --> 34:00.871
- I should head home.

34:00.873 --> 34:03.181
We've an early one
in the morning.

34:03.183 --> 34:05.975
Heading up the country
for a few days.

34:05.977 --> 34:08.582
Show the small man
there's more to the world.

34:08.584 --> 34:10.815
- Come on.
Let's go show you off.

34:15.294 --> 34:16.359
Oh.

34:27.273 --> 34:29.174
I... I don't know.

34:29.176 --> 34:31.770
-Christmas jumper.
-Christmas jumper,
that's the one.

34:32.278 --> 34:34.938
Okay, um...

34:36.216 --> 34:38.678
you could go
anywhere in the world.

34:38.680 --> 34:40.350
No conditions.
Where would you go?

34:42.387 --> 34:43.584
Do you know what...

34:44.884 --> 34:49.051
I'd rather just...
reel the years back in...

34:49.053 --> 34:51.790
and sit you
and your father down
and make ye act like adults.

34:57.468 --> 35:01.701
It's nice
imagining you getting along,
living under the one roof.

35:08.105 --> 35:11.282
But I'm proud the way
you are now, though.

35:11.284 --> 35:13.779
It's as if the work itself
was the beginning
and the end of it.

35:15.486 --> 35:16.914
- Hey, Dan.

35:16.916 --> 35:19.455
-- Hey, Sarah.
-Can I get a whiskey, please?

35:19.457 --> 35:20.786
You can, of course. Yeah.

35:24.154 --> 35:25.461
Did you want another drink?

35:26.992 --> 35:29.465
No. No, stay there.
I'll get it, all right.

35:36.100 --> 35:37.473
Let me get you this.

35:37.475 --> 35:40.410
Oh, you're grand.
Thanks, though.

35:47.518 --> 35:49.452
You out for the night?

35:49.454 --> 35:51.179
We'll see now after this one.

35:51.181 --> 35:52.224
Mmm-hmm.

35:56.824 --> 35:58.824
I can't believe
you're still here, to be honest.

36:00.960 --> 36:03.367
I thought you would have
long abandoned this place.

36:05.536 --> 36:06.898
I don't know
why you'd think that.

36:08.572 --> 36:10.473
Everything I ever needed
was here.

36:11.839 --> 36:13.278
Didn't have to go
looking for it.

36:14.644 --> 36:15.676
Hmm.

36:19.484 --> 36:20.549
Like what?

36:24.654 --> 36:27.688
Nah. We used to have
a good craic together
when we were younger, didn't we?

36:28.724 --> 36:30.394
-Us?
-Mmm-hmm.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.925
It was so long ago.

36:35.533 --> 36:37.434
I wouldn't get hung up on it
if I were you.

36:41.539 --> 36:42.670
What are you drinking?

36:45.136 --> 36:47.741
Go on sure, surprise me.

36:52.616 --> 36:55.551
I, um... two of the same again.

36:55.553 --> 36:57.520
-Uh, she's having
whiskey, is she?
-- Mmm-hmm.

37:01.251 --> 37:02.294
- There you go.

37:04.595 --> 37:05.627
There's...

37:12.900 --> 37:14.867
What time is low tide due?

37:15.573 --> 37:16.704
Go on, will you?

37:18.169 --> 37:19.839
All right. Night, pet.

37:20.941 --> 37:22.039
Good night.

37:38.189 --> 37:40.662
- I might borrow
that top off you
one of the nights, Aileen.

37:42.336 --> 37:43.797
- I'll see you
tomorrow, girl.

39:25.395 --> 39:26.702
- Sorry, lads.

39:32.039 --> 39:33.841
-Good morning.
-- Good morning.

39:52.598 --> 39:53.960
Were you out last night?

39:53.962 --> 39:56.765
- No, no.
I was not. Were you out?

40:32.363 --> 40:33.736
Good night so, was it?

41:08.267 --> 41:10.674
- Mary, look.

41:10.676 --> 41:14.469
-Look at that.
-Stop the belt. Aileen.

41:18.552 --> 41:21.080
-Fungus.
-Shit.

41:24.822 --> 41:26.184
- We've got fungus, too.

41:27.187 --> 41:28.483
- Let me see that!

41:31.290 --> 41:33.697
-Check the rest of the stock.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.028
- Throw these ones out.

41:36.031 --> 41:38.537
Fuck's sake!
What a disaster.

41:47.141 --> 41:48.206
- Jesus!

41:51.541 --> 41:53.211
-Sarah?
-Don't touch me.

42:14.399 --> 42:15.739
You are hereby warned

42:15.741 --> 42:18.236
to cease cultivation
of all oyster holdings

42:18.238 --> 42:20.073
until further notice,

42:20.075 --> 42:24.077
punishable by loss of license
if caught in breach
of the moratorium.

42:24.079 --> 42:27.685
Any oysters you harvested today
must be destroyed.

42:38.863 --> 42:40.390
- Do you have
any work for me?

42:40.392 --> 42:42.964
- No, I'm not gonna
need you again
for a while, no.

42:42.966 --> 42:45.197
Keep your head down
like the rest of 'em,
you'll be grand.

42:45.199 --> 42:46.803
I'll take what you owe me, so.

42:51.304 --> 42:55.108
- All right, lads,
let's throw them all out. Yeah.

44:00.978 --> 44:03.176
-- What are we
supposed to do now, like?
-- Oh.

44:03.178 --> 44:05.541
- Same thing happened,
about seven or eight years ago,
didn't it?

44:05.543 --> 44:07.345
Nearly destroyed
the oyster farmers.

44:07.347 --> 44:09.754
- The idea of them
at home doing nothing.
No good for anyone.

44:09.756 --> 44:12.581
- It seems to be gotten
worse and worse for her,
doesn't it?

44:13.023 --> 44:14.319
Poor cratur.

44:16.928 --> 44:18.697
She didn't mean to bite at you.

44:20.294 --> 44:23.735
If Francie's done something,
she needs to speak up about it.

44:51.930 --> 44:53.490
-- Hey, love.
-Hiya.

44:55.494 --> 44:57.626
Are you busy?

44:57.628 --> 45:02.334
Not a great time, no.
I'm just doing
a few jobs on the house.

45:02.336 --> 45:05.172
Mom says they haven't seen you
in the factory in a few days.

45:06.846 --> 45:08.571
The smell's finally
getting to you, is it?

45:09.673 --> 45:10.705
No.

45:15.888 --> 45:17.382
What's after happening, girl?

45:20.651 --> 45:23.421
I'm here, you know.

45:25.722 --> 45:28.800
If you need anything. Yeah?

45:32.168 --> 45:33.200
Yeah.

45:38.845 --> 45:40.141
I'll let you get back to it.

45:43.179 --> 45:44.178
Thanks.

47:58.875 --> 47:59.951
- Hello?

48:02.483 --> 48:03.515
Aileen.

48:20.765 --> 48:23.865
Aileen. How are things?
Hey, you might follow me
through here now.

48:27.079 --> 48:28.771
We're just in here now, look.

48:41.093 --> 48:42.455
How's Con gettin' on?

48:44.690 --> 48:46.888
Where's Brian, Mike?

48:46.890 --> 48:49.231
Sorry to drag you
all the way into town.

48:51.268 --> 48:54.698
You must be delighted
to have Brian
back in the house with you.

48:54.700 --> 48:56.403
Sure, you know yourself.

48:56.405 --> 48:57.734
Do you reckon?

48:57.736 --> 48:59.571
God knows if my girls
moved back into the house,

48:59.573 --> 49:01.276
we'd be tearing strips
off each other.

49:02.246 --> 49:03.971
Australia he was, was it?

49:03.973 --> 49:05.445
Australia, yeah.

49:05.447 --> 49:08.646
Isn't that always the way?
Breaking his mother's heart.

49:10.452 --> 49:11.583
Exactly.

49:12.652 --> 49:15.323
Look, there's been a claim made

49:15.325 --> 49:18.821
about an assault in the village
a couple of weeks back

49:18.823 --> 49:21.626
by a young woman
who was in Dan Nell's pub

49:21.628 --> 49:24.662
on the night
of the 18th of April.

49:24.664 --> 49:27.698
Brian says he was at home
with you that night.

49:28.437 --> 49:29.535
Is that right?

49:31.176 --> 49:33.572
He was, yeah.

49:33.574 --> 49:37.048
-He didn't go out
or anything at any stage...
-No. No.

49:37.050 --> 49:40.183
And you'd say that again
in court?

49:40.185 --> 49:41.448
I would. Yeah.

49:43.650 --> 49:48.422
All right. Look, I know,
well, Brian's
a hard-workin' fella.

49:48.424 --> 49:49.819
Is that it?

49:49.821 --> 49:52.393
I'll give him a shout
for you there now. One minute.

49:53.495 --> 49:55.363
It's a bit much, Mike, isn't it,

49:55.365 --> 49:58.201
to drag me out
in the middle of the night
just to ask a simple question?

49:58.203 --> 50:00.236
We've to be seen to be
doing our job, Aileen.

50:49.386 --> 50:50.583
Are you all right?

50:52.587 --> 50:56.457
Huh. Need to go for a few pints.

50:56.459 --> 50:58.723
My van is on the way back.
We might pick it up.

51:07.305 --> 51:09.734
Was there anyone else out,
do you remember?

51:12.871 --> 51:14.068
I couldn't tell you.

51:26.819 --> 51:28.819
What happened after I left you?

51:29.954 --> 51:31.327
We had a few drinks.

51:33.463 --> 51:35.430
Nothing we didn't do
back in the day.

51:39.370 --> 51:40.567
What does that mean?

51:44.309 --> 51:45.638
Jesus Christ...

51:49.446 --> 51:51.974
Am I better off going back
to fucking Australia?

51:53.648 --> 51:56.451
Is that it? Getting dragged
into this shit.

51:58.884 --> 52:00.884
You're not going
anywhere, all right?

52:02.426 --> 52:03.524
Do you hear me?

52:31.653 --> 52:32.685
Thanks, Mom.

52:49.902 --> 52:52.837
- The moratorium
won't last, is the point.

52:52.839 --> 52:54.839
In a couple of weeks,
the water will cool,

52:54.841 --> 52:57.380
all will magically reset.

52:57.382 --> 53:00.944
Oyster farmers coining it again,
like nothing ever happened.

53:01.716 --> 53:03.221
That's what time does.

53:04.081 --> 53:06.180
Lesson wasted on the young.

53:06.182 --> 53:08.523
- Aileen? Aileen.

53:10.054 --> 53:12.824
Are there any extra hours
I can pick up next week?

53:12.826 --> 53:14.727
You might cover Sarah's shifts.

53:16.335 --> 53:17.763
You haven't heard from her?

53:21.571 --> 53:23.241
I have. Yeah.

53:42.922 --> 53:44.592
We've had Guards into us.

53:46.431 --> 53:48.530
Yera, no...

53:48.532 --> 53:50.257
they were just looking
to talk to customers

53:50.259 --> 53:51.797
who were in a few weeks back.

53:54.164 --> 53:55.471
It was a quiet night...

53:56.606 --> 53:58.133
That's what I told them.

54:02.876 --> 54:04.447
It'd be more in their line now

54:04.449 --> 54:06.449
to be looking into
foreign trawlers raping
our oceans, huh?

54:08.585 --> 54:11.982
Their hands are tied,
that's what
they'll tell you anyway.

54:18.254 --> 54:20.298
Why wasn't Jesus
born in Australia?

54:20.597 --> 54:21.860
Oye.

54:21.862 --> 54:22.894
-Ah, 'cause he was...

54:22.896 --> 54:23.928
- Night, lads.

54:24.700 --> 54:26.601
-- All right.
-Yeah.

54:26.603 --> 54:28.097
Are you in with us
tomorrow again, girl?

54:28.099 --> 54:30.198
I am, yeah. Thanks.

54:30.200 --> 54:31.738
-Night to you.
-- Night.

54:31.740 --> 54:32.805
- Night.

54:34.743 --> 54:36.479
Because there was no wise men...

54:40.276 --> 54:41.616
No virgins either.

54:43.246 --> 54:44.454
-All right.
-Hmm.

54:44.951 --> 54:45.983
- Good man.

54:48.086 --> 54:50.988
-Come on...

54:55.599 --> 54:57.830
-- Night.
-- Night to you. Night.

55:14.618 --> 55:15.716
Is Brian in?

55:17.786 --> 55:19.852
A charge is gonna be
brought against him.

55:19.854 --> 55:23.185
He needs to present himself
in front of the district court
today week,

55:23.187 --> 55:26.122
and an initial remand
will be made
in front of a judge.

55:26.124 --> 55:27.860
For fuck sake, Mike.

55:27.862 --> 55:30.093
Look, just make sure
he's there, will you?

55:46.485 --> 55:48.386
- You told them
you weren't out that night.

55:51.985 --> 55:54.282
But we both know
that's a lie, though.

55:54.284 --> 55:56.020
What do you know about it, Erin?

55:58.321 --> 56:01.498
There's Francie mistreating her
for how many years,

56:01.500 --> 56:04.897
and nobody
thinks anything of it.

56:04.899 --> 56:07.867
And suddenly everyone reckons
that Brian's the problem.

56:07.869 --> 56:12.366
Who never put a hand
on a woman in his life.

56:12.368 --> 56:15.237
You said yourself something
was after happening to Sarah.

56:16.878 --> 56:19.076
Maybe it was Francie, yeah.

56:20.948 --> 56:22.981
But you don't want
to hear her side?

56:48.206 --> 56:49.238
Are you all right?

56:52.111 --> 56:53.583
- Sarah's
not in again today?

57:41.666 --> 57:43.028
What time will you be back?

57:44.163 --> 57:45.195
I don't know.

57:53.678 --> 57:55.711
What happens
if he's returned for trial?

57:57.583 --> 58:03.345
<i>♪ At waking time and sleeping</i>

58:04.788 --> 58:09.252

58:10.794 --> 58:14.389
<i>♪ To walk again</i>

58:14.391 --> 58:18.602
<i>♪ Those kindly streets</i>

58:18.604 --> 58:24.234

58:27.041 --> 58:28.073
Come on.

58:30.341 --> 58:31.681
How does it finish?

58:33.344 --> 58:34.442
Hmm?

58:35.852 --> 58:41.020

<i>♪ For the wren... ♪</i>

58:57.302 --> 58:59.500
There's nothing
wrong with you, Paddy, mate.

59:00.503 --> 59:01.975
Hmm.

59:01.977 --> 59:04.406
You're only playing a trick
on the rest of us.

59:08.577 --> 59:10.181
What other songs do you have?

59:12.889 --> 59:15.285
A verse of<i> McAlpines?</i> Hmm?

59:17.322 --> 59:19.388
A blast of<i> The Wild Rover</i> maybe?

59:25.902 --> 59:26.934
Good man.

59:29.202 --> 59:30.234
Hm.

59:32.073 --> 59:35.745
- The complainant
waited a week
before making her report

59:35.747 --> 59:40.013
and claims she was
followed down to the local pier
on the night of the assault

59:40.015 --> 59:43.951
and that the defendant
subsequently raped her
down there.

59:43.953 --> 59:48.351
The defendant's mother
has provided him
with an alibi, Judge.

59:48.353 --> 59:51.728
And she reaffirms the statement
that she and the defendant
were in the house

59:51.730 --> 59:53.455
during the hours
of the night in question,

59:53.457 --> 59:56.392
that the defendant remained
in the house with her

59:56.394 --> 59:58.097
during the hours
of the claimed assault?

59:59.496 --> 1:00:01.133
I do, Your Honor. Yes.

1:00:01.630 --> 1:00:02.805
- Hmm.

1:00:04.633 --> 1:00:07.304
This is a serious accusation.

1:00:07.306 --> 1:00:10.780
It's also the first time
the defendant
has been before the court.

1:00:13.147 --> 1:00:15.180
Now it's my opinion
that there's not enough...

1:00:15.182 --> 1:00:18.480
in the Book of Evidence
for the State to prosecute.

1:00:18.482 --> 1:00:21.989
Charges will be remanded
back to the DPP
for further instructions.

1:00:21.991 --> 1:00:26.125
I also believe that this charge
should not have been
brought before the court.

1:00:27.326 --> 1:00:29.029
Uh, the defendant
is free to leave.

1:00:33.332 --> 1:00:34.397
What's next?

1:00:35.664 --> 1:00:37.499
- File 15, Judge.

1:00:38.634 --> 1:00:40.007
Drunk and disorderly.

1:03:02.646 --> 1:03:05.251
- Aileen.
Come here a minute, will you?

1:03:11.930 --> 1:03:13.457
What's her attendance lately?

1:03:17.496 --> 1:03:20.266
Fourteen of 16 shifts missed.

1:03:20.268 --> 1:03:23.797
- I can make
the days up. Please.

1:03:23.799 --> 1:03:25.975
- Has anyone else
missed a shift in the same time?

1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:30.672
You could have let us know
at least, you know,
called in sick.

1:03:32.181 --> 1:03:33.708
But I have to let you go, girl.

1:03:39.419 --> 1:03:40.550
You're right, Dennis.

1:03:43.093 --> 1:03:45.687
I should've let you know
what's been happening with me.

1:03:47.328 --> 1:03:49.196
That was the mistake, yeah?

1:03:51.167 --> 1:03:53.530
It's all very convenient
for you, though, isn't it?

1:03:55.006 --> 1:03:58.007
Between Francie's oyster bags
and everything else,

1:03:58.009 --> 1:03:59.701
everyone's got their
fucking eyes closed.

1:04:03.278 --> 1:04:04.882
- Wait, hang on a second.

1:04:07.645 --> 1:04:08.677
Sarah?

1:04:10.549 --> 1:04:12.582
What about
the oyster bags, Sarah?

1:04:19.690 --> 1:04:21.624
Come on lads, focus,
back on the work.

1:04:27.632 --> 1:04:29.797
What does she mean
about Francie's oysters, Aileen?

1:04:32.208 --> 1:04:33.240
Go home.

1:04:34.309 --> 1:04:36.012
-What?
-Go home for the day.

1:04:56.166 --> 1:04:57.528
Oscar, love.

1:04:59.433 --> 1:05:02.731
You can't just take him
out of daycare
without telling me.

1:05:02.733 --> 1:05:04.007
He's not your son.

1:05:05.472 --> 1:05:07.406
I don't want you
looking after him anymore.

1:05:07.408 --> 1:05:09.408
Fuck's sake, Erin.
She's still his grandmother.

1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:13.379
If you'd actually sit with her,

1:05:13.381 --> 1:05:15.645
you wouldn't be able to deny
what happened so easily, Aileen.

1:05:15.647 --> 1:05:18.582
-- Go easy on her.
-- No.

1:05:18.584 --> 1:05:20.584
For fuck's sake,
she needs to hear it.

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:30.968
- I'll talk to her.

1:05:57.623 --> 1:05:59.260
You have to be careful with him.

1:06:22.516 --> 1:06:26.452
And all the time
that Sarah was in here,
when it was Erin's room.

1:06:36.629 --> 1:06:39.531
I used to joke with her mother
about the two of you,

1:06:39.533 --> 1:06:40.829
that we'd be in-laws.

1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:18.273
- Was she lying
about the oyster bags, Aileen?

1:07:21.443 --> 1:07:24.642
I'm gonna have to put you
on the line until I figure out
what the story is.

1:07:28.384 --> 1:07:29.812
Moratorium's been lifted.

1:07:30.980 --> 1:07:32.848
Be a mad few weeks.

1:07:32.850 --> 1:07:35.422
Might have to hire
a few more hands.

1:07:48.437 --> 1:07:49.964
- So the story went round,

1:07:49.966 --> 1:07:51.768
and for months,
people thought the wife died

1:07:51.770 --> 1:07:55.068
'cause she'd fallen down
the well tryin' to save
the turkey.

1:07:55.070 --> 1:07:56.938
It was some clever prick,
the guard.

1:07:56.940 --> 1:07:59.776
- It'd be great
to have you all over
next Sunday after mass.

1:08:00.713 --> 1:08:02.449
Give you a rest for once.

1:08:04.882 --> 1:08:06.519
Be a break for you.

1:08:06.521 --> 1:08:08.587
- As if he'd been
waiting for that question
the entire time.

1:08:08.589 --> 1:08:09.885
-- I'll do
my apple crumble.

1:08:09.887 --> 1:08:11.986
"Because she was
an annoying bitch, that's why."

1:08:22.768 --> 1:08:24.867
- Two gins
and a tonic, please?

1:08:24.869 --> 1:08:25.934
- Not tonight, no.

1:08:27.135 --> 1:08:29.245
- What?

1:08:29.247 --> 1:08:31.511
- We retain the right
to refuse service here, love.

1:08:33.141 --> 1:08:34.514
Do yourself a favor
and go quietly.

1:08:35.583 --> 1:08:36.615
Hmm?

1:08:43.151 --> 1:08:44.689
You can all go to fuckin' hell.

1:08:48.156 --> 1:08:50.200
- You stay
where you are now, lad.

1:08:50.202 --> 1:08:52.433
-Hold on to him there, boys.

1:08:52.435 --> 1:08:53.995
Don't you go
following her now, eh?

1:09:43.145 --> 1:09:44.617
- I hate
these traditional things.

1:09:51.527 --> 1:09:53.296
Showing face
just for the sake of it.

1:09:56.697 --> 1:09:58.059
I might not bother going.

1:10:02.571 --> 1:10:03.735

1:13:15.566 --> 1:13:17.093
Aileen, would you come in here?

1:13:35.278 --> 1:13:36.310

-Don't fuckin' touch her.

1:16:26.053 --> 1:16:28.449
-- Condolences
for your loss, Brian.
-Thanks.

1:16:41.233 --> 1:16:43.596
Seems like the whole world
has turned upside down.

1:16:47.404 --> 1:16:50.812
It's just as fucked
as it's ever been, Mom.

1:16:50.814 --> 1:16:52.913
It might look different
if you're the one turning.
But...

1:16:55.643 --> 1:16:56.818
nothing's changed.

1:17:01.121 --> 1:17:02.153
Trust me.

1:17:10.834 --> 1:17:13.461
You were right stepping in
like that, though.

1:17:23.638 --> 1:17:24.846
We're going to head home.

1:17:25.816 --> 1:17:26.881
Get some rest.

1:17:29.611 --> 1:17:30.687
You should, too.

1:17:44.461 --> 1:17:45.526
Huh?

1:17:45.528 --> 1:17:46.934
- What do you want?

1:17:46.936 --> 1:17:49.530
Um, whiskey, I guess.

1:17:49.532 --> 1:17:50.740
-You want whiskey?
-Yeah.

1:17:50.742 --> 1:17:52.203
- Here,
two whiskeys, please.

1:17:52.205 --> 1:17:53.369
- Two whiskeys, huh?

1:17:53.371 --> 1:17:54.744
-- Yeah.
-- You look great.

1:17:54.746 --> 1:17:56.372
-- Thanks.
-- How're ye, lads?

1:17:58.343 --> 1:18:00.310
-Do you like whiskey, you do?
-Hmm.

1:18:00.312 --> 1:18:01.344
- Oh, yeah?

1:18:02.611 --> 1:18:04.820
-That one's for you.
-Thanks.

1:18:04.822 --> 1:18:05.854
Brian?

1:18:08.188 --> 1:18:10.826
-Aileen, you know Emma, you do?
-Hi.

1:18:12.324 --> 1:18:14.896
You're better off
going home, girl.
He's a bit old for you.

1:18:14.898 --> 1:18:16.029
- What are you doing?

1:18:17.626 --> 1:18:20.627
In what world did you ever think
that this would be appropriate?

1:18:20.629 --> 1:18:22.904
What're you talking about?

1:18:22.906 --> 1:18:24.873
For fuck's sake,
who do you think
I am at all, Mom?

1:18:24.875 --> 1:18:26.875
Hey, hey. Don't put your hands
on your mother.

1:18:29.341 --> 1:18:33.442
-Con, what the... Con!
-You're a fucking disgrace.

1:18:36.414 --> 1:18:38.986
- Get off me!

1:18:38.988 --> 1:18:40.020
Get off!

1:20:22.751 --> 1:20:25.059
If you're here to shout,
don't fuckin' bother.
I'm going out.

1:20:49.118 --> 1:20:51.250
- Imagine
what it'll be like
out here in a year?

1:20:55.058 --> 1:20:57.058
This is the investment
round us, like.

1:21:05.365 --> 1:21:08.168
Do you not feel anything
about what's happened, no?

1:21:11.338 --> 1:21:12.568
About Sarah...

1:21:16.244 --> 1:21:17.914
about what you did to her?

1:21:19.841 --> 1:21:21.742
Don't look at me
like that, will you?

1:21:25.187 --> 1:21:28.320
Does it mean
absolutely nothing to you?

1:21:28.322 --> 1:21:30.355
Is there no heart
or feeling in you?

1:21:30.357 --> 1:21:31.620
Jesus Christ!

1:21:34.922 --> 1:21:38.726
You have this
impossible image of me, Aileen.

1:21:42.468 --> 1:21:44.336
Let's just move forward,
all right?

1:21:48.309 --> 1:21:49.979
I want you out of our lives.

1:24:00.969 --> 1:24:02.034
- Mom!

1:24:03.510 --> 1:24:04.674
Mom!

1:24:09.219 --> 1:24:10.383
Mom!

1:26:28.457 --> 1:26:31.590
- Sarah,
love, can I step in?

1:26:54.516 --> 1:26:57.781
I'm ashamed, girl.
Sitting in your house.

1:27:02.183 --> 1:27:04.216
I'm sorry to be
bothering you, I...

1:27:05.186 --> 1:27:06.724
I don't know why I had to. I...

1:27:08.695 --> 1:27:10.365
I'm not explaining myself.

1:27:16.373 --> 1:27:17.537
You shouldn't be leaving.

1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:47.435
The wind the past few weeks...

1:27:49.406 --> 1:27:51.538
These houses are
so fuckin' bad for it.

1:27:54.774 --> 1:27:56.807
I suppose that's what
Mary was hearing.

1:27:58.745 --> 1:28:00.514
Sound of Mark in all the rooms.

1:28:03.585 --> 1:28:05.277
Just the wind getting through.

1:28:11.494 --> 1:28:14.825
The way I used to listen
to my mother at nights,

1:28:14.827 --> 1:28:17.366
carrying Dad down to bed
when he'd be pissed.

1:28:20.261 --> 1:28:22.635
Hearing her moving around
the rest of the night then,

1:28:23.473 --> 1:28:24.967
crying away to herself.

1:28:26.641 --> 1:28:28.806
Me just lying there
in my own room.

1:28:33.340 --> 1:28:36.385
Twenty years ago,
and I can still hear their echo.

1:28:48.355 --> 1:28:51.290
I suppose every house
around here has the same ghosts.

1:28:56.869 --> 1:29:00.937
Mom was so proud of the fact
that she was able
to leave me this house.

1:29:06.340 --> 1:29:08.483
I'd live here after she did,

1:29:10.212 --> 1:29:14.148
and so on...
until the tide takes it.

1:29:23.390 --> 1:29:26.666
All the times I used to wake up
in your house, Aileen...

1:29:29.572 --> 1:29:31.407
Brian in the bed beside me.

1:29:36.403 --> 1:29:39.140
That same wind
keeping me awake every night.

1:29:45.786 --> 1:29:48.149
Is it the sound of him
that's haunting me...

1:29:49.383 --> 1:29:51.185
with all these other ghosts?

1:29:54.256 --> 1:29:56.322
The thunder of pasts getting in.

1:29:56.324 --> 1:29:59.226
Because
all of a sudden, I...

1:30:01.538 --> 1:30:02.900
I don't know where I am.

1:30:06.741 --> 1:30:09.973
As if this house
and all its history wasn't mine.
