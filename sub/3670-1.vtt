01:06.650 --> 01:07.651
Good.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.576
Why don't you take it?

01:16.577 --> 01:20.456
Bastards...

01:21.332 --> 01:22.750
Okay then!

01:23.417 --> 01:28.714
Hero of the Goboi plains!
Stand up, Kim Jin-pyong!

01:36.680 --> 01:41.643
Bottoms up!
Pass it down.

01:41.644 --> 01:44.939
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

01:46.357 --> 01:49.193
Commander,
I'm abstaining from alcohol.

01:49.276 --> 01:52.863
Abstaining? You fool!

01:56.617 --> 02:03.790
The late chief exchanged drinks with
every one of his men in this! Drink up!

02:03.791 --> 02:09.630
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

02:10.798 --> 02:12.299
Good!

02:13.342 --> 02:14.426
There you go!

02:14.635 --> 02:15.635
Good, good!

02:17.471 --> 02:20.141

Producer KIM Dae-woo, PARK Dae-hee

03:09.315 --> 03:14.861
Fuck, I'm sick
and tired of Goboi Plains.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.988
What again?

03:17.031 --> 03:20.284
Always sticking up
for his son-in-law.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.497
Shit, everybody's brave
when you're about to fuckin' die.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.543
But you've never
even been in battle.

03:30.294 --> 03:34.506
He's at the top of the line
and he's the best.

03:36.175 --> 03:37.967
Well, yeah...

03:37.968 --> 03:39.637
Hey! What are you doing out?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.388
- What?
- Get back in.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.266
- Okay, we're going.
- Hurry back in!

03:44.558 --> 03:45.851
We're going.

03:50.356 --> 03:56.695
By the way, I heard something
about Kim Jin-pyong...

03:57.696 --> 03:59.406
You can't tell this to anyone.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.867
I won't. Just spill it.

04:02.868 --> 04:07.915
- No, you're a big mouth.
- Hey, that's not true.

05:19.445 --> 05:22.323
We were in Vietnam
during the same period.

05:22.364 --> 05:25.826
That's right.
Colonel, you're my idol.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.077
We must've met at least once.

05:28.078 --> 05:32.708
That's impossible
'cause he had the easy assignments.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.586
Do you know Captain Kyung?

05:36.420 --> 05:39.840
I've heard of him,
he was very famous.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.551
Weren't you Commodore Park's galloper?

05:44.511 --> 05:45.554
Yes, sir.

05:46.847 --> 05:50.975
One day,
Commodore Park complained,

05:50.976 --> 05:58.650
"I hate sticky weather!"
So Captain Kyung brought in a heater.

05:59.777 --> 06:02.571
A heater?
In Vietnam?

06:06.533 --> 06:11.872
Imagine how many air conditioners
they must've needed.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.209
- Three large ones, right?
- Yes, sir.

06:16.377 --> 06:19.713
Commodore Park spoke highly of
this friend wherever he went.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.801
You sure are clever.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.095
Not really...

06:26.804 --> 06:29.138
You're from Busan, but have no accent.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.517
I've never had one since childhood.

06:34.645 --> 06:38.899
Your wife's name is unique.
Jong Ga-heun...

06:39.191 --> 06:43.403
- I've never heard of the surname Jong.
- She's Chinese.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.531
Both of her parents are.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.411
There's also something interesting.
Haven't you noticed it yet?

06:57.668 --> 07:03.424
My wife's birthday and yours
are on the same date September 20.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.801
Isn't that interesting?

07:12.182 --> 07:17.813
We shouldn't just gather for gossip.
We're not living in the old days.

07:17.938 --> 07:25.529
We should do something meaningful.
Be more helpful to our husbands, right?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.448
Dinner's ready.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.782
Hurry UP-

07:34.830 --> 07:38.583
Lieutenant Colonel Choi's wife came up
with the group's name.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.711
She's brilliant.

07:41.587 --> 07:44.965
- Yeah?
- Don't you want to know?

07:46.675 --> 07:47.718
What is it?

07:49.052 --> 07:52.306
The Nightingales!
Isn't it just grand?

07:52.890 --> 07:57.686
Give us a speech for the inauguration
at the hospital 2 days later.

08:00.522 --> 08:01.607
Do I have to go?

08:01.648 --> 08:07.488
You must.
Your support gives us authority.

08:08.363 --> 08:11.574
The Korea Defense Daily
is doing a report

08:11.575 --> 08:13.327
so you have to be in the photo.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.996
I'm doing this for you.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.718
What are the circles for?

08:31.053 --> 08:32.053
Oh, that?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.682
The doctor told me
When I will ovulate.

08:36.642 --> 08:40.604
Oh my, what day is it today?

08:43.106 --> 08:45.526
Oh my...

08:47.361 --> 08:49.321
Wow...

08:55.244 --> 08:56.244
Good...

08:57.746 --> 08:58.746
I love it...

09:06.296 --> 09:11.426
You were great!

09:12.219 --> 09:15.472
You get better and better.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.893
I was so feeling it today.

09:28.235 --> 09:32.155
- How long do you have to stay like that?
- About an hour.

09:33.699 --> 09:37.953
The new sergeant couple
moved into our front house.

09:38.870 --> 09:43.584
The captain seemed so happy
to be near us.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.461
He really seems to admire you.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.088
Really?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.967
The wife is Chinese.

09:53.468 --> 09:57.598
- They're also childless.
- I noticed from his papers.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.644
We were the only childless couple
in this residence.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.772
Maybe that's why I like her.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.277
You like her?

10:13.405 --> 10:18.118
She seems shy and
a bit uneasy around people.

10:19.786 --> 10:23.999
But she must love birds,
having so many bird cages.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.169
Chinese people like birds.

10:27.711 --> 10:31.214
Oh no... This is all wrong.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.160
The bird doesn't like that.

12:32.502 --> 12:33.502
I apologize.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.346
Do birds annoy you?

12:44.973 --> 12:48.643
No, it was just for fun.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.147
I'm sorry.

12:54.941 --> 12:58.653
It's okay,
if you don't hate them.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.834
Do you live in the residence?

13:15.253 --> 13:16.253
Yes.

13:34.940 --> 13:40.403
Tinnitus, insomnia,
panic disorder...

13:42.572 --> 13:47.285
Panic disorder is serious,
but with some effort it's curable.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.331
However delirium...

13:54.501 --> 13:56.378
Seeing the Vietcong is
a symptom of delirium

13:58.338 --> 13:59.923
and this is even more serious.

14:01.550 --> 14:05.220
It happens only once in a while.

14:05.971 --> 14:06.971
Still...

14:11.393 --> 14:13.311
What kind of dreams
do you dream?

14:14.521 --> 14:15.522
My dreams?

14:27.492 --> 14:32.497
<i>In my dreams, I'm always
at that jungle.</i>

14:39.296 --> 14:43.508
<i>So strange
since I don't feel any guilt.</i>

15:06.907 --> 15:07.908
What about alcohol?

15:10.911 --> 15:13.162
With all of your nagging I stopped.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.915
When I do drink, I throw it all up.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.423
Alcohol is strictly prohibited.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.637
- Got it? I said never.
- Okay, got it.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.139
- See ya.
- I said never.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.397
Did you tell anyone...

15:41.274 --> 15:42.442
about me?

15:46.029 --> 15:47.029
No.

15:48.865 --> 15:49.865
I'm sorry.

15:57.624 --> 16:02.796
<i>Diagnosis - Influenza</i>

16:06.299 --> 16:08.927
You darling, stay there
and you love, move down.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.889
You two...
Yes, switch places.

16:15.600 --> 16:22.524
- Can I stand behind the colonel?
- Stop talking and just move.

16:23.817 --> 16:24.484
Let's see.

16:24.776 --> 16:29.489
- I think we're good now.
- No, the first line has to be presentable.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.157
Now we're done.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.914
Who's that?

16:38.957 --> 16:43.294
I thought you couldn't come.
Come on over!

16:45.296 --> 16:47.841
The wife of the new sergeant
Captain Kyung Woo-jin.

16:48.550 --> 16:49.843
Your name was Ga-heun, right?

16:51.177 --> 16:52.511
This is...

16:52.512 --> 16:54.180
the wife of Lieutenant Colonel Choi.

16:54.723 --> 16:59.394
Jacqueline Kennedy is here.
- It was tailored in a hurry.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.313
She's even humble.

17:02.939 --> 17:06.901
After a month of preparations,
we still look like country-girls.

17:08.403 --> 17:10.695
Excessive humility is arrogance.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.696
Enough.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.035
My husband,

17:15.535 --> 17:18.288
Colonel Kim Jin-pyong

17:21.875 --> 17:24.460
- Darling, you go up.
- Me?

17:24.461 --> 17:25.462
And Ga-heun...

17:27.422 --> 17:28.422
Let's see.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.008
Good!

17:34.304 --> 17:35.304
Tilt it 15 degrees.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.028
It's like we're nurses.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.323
Madam, you're like the head nurse.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.247
Settle down.

18:02.499 --> 18:04.059
Don't make a fuss.
It's just a hospital.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.544
Please do something.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.135
Stop crying.
Did somebody die?

18:16.721 --> 18:18.139
Kimchi?

18:20.600 --> 18:25.230
I thought he was fasting.
Great going...

18:25.605 --> 18:28.274
Let's take a picture!

18:31.194 --> 18:33.780
My husband is upset.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.200
Nobody paid attention to his advice.

18:38.535 --> 18:40.995
His voice was too small.

18:41.621 --> 18:45.750
Can I ask a personal question?

18:47.293 --> 18:50.380
Why I don't have a child?

18:51.840 --> 18:56.094
I also hate that question,
but I'm curious.

18:56.803 --> 19:00.181
Well, I'm just...
still not pregnant.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.310
I thought you weren't
having one on purpose.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.009
Following the American-style...

19:08.523 --> 19:09.816
Let's be friends.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.655
You're just
too gentle and kind.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.161
The wives here
are a bit aggressive.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.914
Yes?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.457
I'm sorry...

19:26.791 --> 19:31.546
I just wanted to say
how encouraging your visit is.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.506
It's my pleasure.

19:34.007 --> 19:38.011
Such a handsome man...
It's a pity that your leg is...

19:38.303 --> 19:40.013
Well, I can't do anything about it.

19:40.805 --> 19:46.852
What's amazing is it still itches
like I have a leg.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.189
That's called phantom pain, right?

19:50.190 --> 19:52.692
Wow, you're well-informed.

19:53.067 --> 19:56.654
Could you help me up?

19:56.946 --> 19:58.615
Of course.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.745
Slowly... slowly...

20:07.665 --> 20:11.461
Fucking Vietcong!
I'll kill you all!

20:16.841 --> 20:18.718
What are you doing?

20:19.219 --> 20:21.012
Put the knife down, now!

20:21.971 --> 20:24.264
Put it down and
talk with me.

20:24.265 --> 20:28.394
Fuck!
Send me to Korea.

20:28.478 --> 20:32.397
This is Korea.
Let her go.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.276
Vietcong's there...
Vietcong...

20:37.487 --> 20:40.740
There aren't any Vietcong here.
We're in Korea.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.575
Vietcong, Vietcong!

20:44.035 --> 20:45.118
You son of a bitch.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.119
Let her go.

20:46.537 --> 20:49.165
Send me to Korea,
you son of a bitch!

20:49.249 --> 20:51.918
This is my last warning.
Let her go.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.671
Vietcong! Vietcong!

20:56.297 --> 20:57.507
I'm okay.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.218
Don't shoot.

21:01.886 --> 21:05.640
Vietcong's over there.
Shit, you're lying!

21:08.643 --> 21:11.520
We're in Korea.
There are no Vietcong.

21:11.521 --> 21:14.732
See, I'm putting my gun down.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.778
The Vietcong are
here again to beat me.

21:20.863 --> 21:21.863
Don't worry.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.618
I'll take you to Korea.
Don't worry.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.291
Madame!

21:31.833 --> 21:34.168
It's no use.
I don't have a leg.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.005
- Calm down...
- You abandoned me.

21:37.255 --> 21:39.465
- Calm down...
- You left me there.

21:39.590 --> 21:40.590
Calm down...

22:08.328 --> 22:09.328
What are you doing!

22:12.332 --> 22:13.833
Vietcong! Vietcong!

22:15.376 --> 22:16.376
Are you okay?

22:17.128 --> 22:18.838
Doctor! Doctor!

22:20.506 --> 22:21.506
Are you okay?

22:26.846 --> 22:30.516
I think I lost my earring.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.019
Where did it go?

22:44.530 --> 22:47.617
<i>She sure is something.</i>

22:48.076 --> 22:51.328
<i>She didn't seem to care about
the blood on her neck.</i>

22:51.329 --> 22:55.375
<i>I know!
I felt the same way.</i>

22:55.625 --> 23:00.171
'Don't shoot, I'm okay.'
Did you hear that bullshit?

23:01.005 --> 23:03.925
Really?
Who does she think she is?

23:04.050 --> 23:07.345
- Putting the Colonel in trouble...
- Goddamnit!

23:07.387 --> 23:11.641
Acting calm and all...

23:12.308 --> 23:15.727
Did you see how she just
nodded to greet me?

23:15.728 --> 23:19.106
I was shocked
but I didn't say a word

23:19.107 --> 23:20.358
because of the occasion.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.528
- I'm not going to do her hair.
- Don't!

23:23.903 --> 23:25.947
I think it's because
she's a Chinese bitch.

23:26.572 --> 23:31.411
You know the rude waiters
in Chinese restaurants...

23:31.452 --> 23:35.623
You're right!
You're so sharp!

23:36.082 --> 23:38.584
Anyway, she's in trouble now.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.088
I'll be watching her.

23:42.630 --> 23:48.886
'I think I lost my earring?'
I can't believe it.

23:50.346 --> 23:51.346
How dare you.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.224
You bastard.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.943
Crazy asshole.

24:04.569 --> 24:05.569
Alright, alright.

24:10.616 --> 24:11.951
What is all this?

24:18.040 --> 24:19.040
Sir!

24:22.712 --> 24:23.880
Are you aware that

24:24.922 --> 24:26.591
he's a patient?

24:28.718 --> 24:31.345
Just making sure he's real.

24:34.098 --> 24:37.852
You know you can tell things
if you beat someone up good.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.021
So?

24:41.898 --> 24:43.232
Is he a fake?

24:44.150 --> 24:45.443
I'm not sure.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.489
But more importantly,

24:50.490 --> 24:54.285
I was mad about troubling you.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.996
It'll never happen again, sir!

25:02.001 --> 25:03.419
Well, anyway...

25:05.922 --> 25:07.381
It was my fault too,

25:09.509 --> 25:12.553
So I'd like to apologize
To your wife in person...

25:14.096 --> 25:16.849
As you wish, sir.

25:19.185 --> 25:22.480
<i>I don't need medicine.
Why are you here?</i>

25:22.730 --> 25:27.568
<i>Can't a mother visit
a daughter shot by a gun?</i>

25:28.069 --> 25:31.822
<i>Who's my mother?
I hate hearing you say that.</i>

25:45.586 --> 25:49.215
- Who could this be?
- What do you care?

25:49.590 --> 25:53.594
<i>I don't want to see you again.</i>

25:53.886 --> 25:54.971
<i>Got it?</i>

25:56.681 --> 25:57.681
<i>Okay.</i>

26:01.394 --> 26:04.897
<i>But eat the medicine.
I'm going.</i>

26:09.569 --> 26:14.031
See you again, dandy officer.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.805
You were wounded because of me.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.475
I came to apologize
and see how you were.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.273
The flowers are very pretty.

26:50.693 --> 26:52.445
I'm not familiar with flowers...

26:54.572 --> 26:55.615
If they're left like that

26:57.950 --> 26:59.869
the flowers will wither.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.039
<i>Hospital Administration</i>

27:07.043 --> 27:09.962
Do you...

27:10.463 --> 27:12.840
have a vase or something?

27:30.650 --> 27:31.650
Colonel Kim.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.360
What's that?

27:34.028 --> 27:35.029
Nothing.

27:39.825 --> 27:40.825
Colonel Kim!

27:45.706 --> 27:48.668
How did you know
I wanted to eat some cake?

28:06.894 --> 28:08.020
By the way...

28:10.523 --> 28:17.071
When you snatched away his knife,
he said something in Vietnamese.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.200
What was it?

28:22.785 --> 28:24.370
Oh, that?

28:28.457 --> 28:30.251
He asked me to save him.

28:30.876 --> 28:34.797
He must have been tortured
by the Vietcong.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.512
What did you say to him?

28:42.221 --> 28:43.681
I said it was all over

28:44.890 --> 28:46.892
and not to worry.

28:51.397 --> 28:55.985
Here...

28:56.485 --> 29:00.698
- What is it?
- What you lost then...

29:03.159 --> 29:04.744
I thought
I would never find it.

29:11.876 --> 29:13.210
Can you put it on for me?

29:14.795 --> 29:15.795
What?

29:21.677 --> 29:22.762
Okay.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.267
I'm bossing you around
too much today.

29:46.285 --> 29:51.749
When you pointed your gun
and told him to let go

29:53.501 --> 29:55.294
you were so amazing.

30:26.909 --> 30:27.909
Oh...

30:28.077 --> 30:30.913
Do you still go to
that music room in town?

30:31.956 --> 30:32.956
What?

30:33.791 --> 30:35.501
What's on your mind?

30:36.210 --> 30:37.670
Any worries?

30:38.045 --> 30:39.630
It's nothing.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.423
What were you saying?

30:42.424 --> 30:47.720
The owner of the music room
was caught by the military police.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.181
You know him, right?

30:50.099 --> 30:52.852
<i>Turns out he's a sly man.</i>

30:53.143 --> 30:57.106
<i>Giving dance lessons
to housewives on Monday mornings.</i>

30:58.899 --> 31:01.610
Informed by intelligence,
we raided the place

31:02.862 --> 31:05.072
and found over ten women.

31:06.156 --> 31:09.076
They ran away screaming like shit.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.704
This guy is as strong as Hercules.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.831
He blocked three of us.

31:14.832 --> 31:17.542
We fuckin' lost all of them.
Son of a bitch!

31:17.543 --> 31:18.878
Officer Kim.

31:21.046 --> 31:24.049
Let's ask a favor.

31:25.301 --> 31:30.889
As a regular, I know him
and it's his first time.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.057
Let him off the hook.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.268
What? No.

31:34.935 --> 31:37.646
There were officer wives
in the group.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.108
But this son of a bitch
won't say a word.

31:43.861 --> 31:47.823
Not beaten enough?

31:47.865 --> 31:49.408
He fought in Vietnam

31:50.409 --> 31:52.244
and served as a master sergeant.

31:57.583 --> 31:58.584
Really?

31:59.668 --> 32:01.921
You're just saying that
to get him out.

32:07.885 --> 32:09.136
You were a noncom?

32:12.222 --> 32:13.807
You must be my senior.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.898
You should be ashamed.

32:21.732 --> 32:25.861
A search troop sergeant
dancing with housewives...

32:27.446 --> 32:29.366
There's the colonel's plea,
and you're my senior.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.956
Let's not meet again
for the same reason.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.625
You're free to go.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.882
As a regular customer,

32:46.966 --> 32:49.301
you must have had
a few dances, Colonel.

33:03.565 --> 33:06.986
- Watch your tongue.
- Yes, sir.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.003
Beer tastes best in the summer.

33:27.381 --> 33:28.382
Were you beaten a lot?

33:28.924 --> 33:31.677
A man is bound to get beaten
outside his home.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.263
What's with the vocal music?

33:37.683 --> 33:39.768
It's just I'm into such music
these clays.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.939
By the way,
the housewives...

33:45.232 --> 33:47.860
Why dance on
a Monday morning?

33:49.695 --> 33:50.779
Monday...

33:51.780 --> 33:53.531
Because it's a Monday morning.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.993
Monday is a new beginning
for everybody.

33:56.326 --> 34:00.371
Husbands go to work,
children to school.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.875
But think of the housewives.

34:04.043 --> 34:05.836
Monday is just another day for them.

34:06.879 --> 34:10.215
They feel lonely
and abandoned.

34:10.674 --> 34:13.886
That's when they go
to the beauty salon.

34:15.304 --> 34:18.806
They do their hair,
dress up

34:19.725 --> 34:21.060
and gather here.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.437
And...

34:29.234 --> 34:30.485
They dance.

34:31.779 --> 34:33.197
It's the waltz.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.826
They forget everything.

34:40.454 --> 34:42.371
They submit themselves
to the men's lead.

34:45.292 --> 34:46.710
And flow to the music.

34:50.339 --> 34:54.301
Their body will sweat
and become hot.

34:56.844 --> 35:00.224
Alcohol and
a touch from a stranger

35:02.392 --> 35:04.228
make them go crazy.

35:05.187 --> 35:07.064
On a lonely Monday morning,

35:07.439 --> 35:12.611
she comes here for herself.
Only for herself!

35:17.324 --> 35:19.618
What am I doing
in front of you...

35:24.123 --> 35:27.626
I didn't know
you had such talent.

35:30.796 --> 35:34.091
I've just started learning.
Why don't you drink?

35:44.143 --> 35:47.146
Captain Kyung is amazing.

35:47.729 --> 35:49.523
He knows exactly what we like.

35:50.274 --> 35:56.613
He gave make-up to the other wives.
Lancome, Chanel... so generous...

36:23.974 --> 36:25.684
What are you thinking about?

36:29.521 --> 36:31.440
Nothing.

36:32.191 --> 36:33.551
You don't want to
go to the picnic?

36:35.861 --> 36:38.530
I was thinking about
something else.

36:43.702 --> 36:44.828
How do I look?

36:49.917 --> 36:53.045
Good, you look like
a French woman.

36:55.672 --> 36:56.840
Hurry up and get ready.

36:58.175 --> 37:00.135
Smoking again...

37:01.303 --> 37:02.721
Goodness...

37:10.812 --> 37:14.608
When did you prepare
all of this?

37:14.900 --> 37:18.237
Even sandwiches!
Let's try.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.365
Yummy spam...

37:22.866 --> 37:27.079
- Honey, try this sandwich.
- I ate too much fruit.

37:29.456 --> 37:32.584
What did you do in Vietnam,
Captain Kyung?

37:32.793 --> 37:34.503
I'm a sham.

37:35.170 --> 37:40.050
I kissed up to senior officers
and had it easy.

37:40.467 --> 37:45.180
I see...
You had it easy.

37:45.430 --> 37:52.020
Colonel Kim was a legend
back then.

37:53.605 --> 37:57.025
All we talked about
was Colonel Kim.

37:57.985 --> 37:59.069
Like what?

37:59.778 --> 38:04.449
Like when his battalion
was besieged.

38:04.491 --> 38:08.704
He was the last one to escape
on a helicopter.

38:09.371 --> 38:15.668
A Vietcong division
shot the helicopter.

38:15.669 --> 38:16.378
Have some...

38:16.379 --> 38:19.839
It didn't go down but
most of the soldiers were killed.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.384
- That's enough. Have a drink.
- Yes, sir.

38:30.017 --> 38:33.395
His search battalion
was really famous.

38:33.812 --> 38:37.816
Even their tattoos made
the Vietcong shake with fear.

38:38.525 --> 38:44.155
They pulled out the guts of the
Vietcong and hung them on trees...

38:44.156 --> 38:45.282
Enough!

38:53.165 --> 38:56.209
The Vietcong did those things first.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.588
We didn't start it.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.005
We just...

39:03.925 --> 39:05.093
returned what they did to us.

39:08.305 --> 39:10.182
I'll get more beer from the car.

39:11.058 --> 39:15.896
I need to go to the toilet.
Honey, excuse me.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.860
- My legs hurt.
- Want a piggyback?

39:22.361 --> 39:23.945
You are so naughty.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.084
I guess it was a bit gross.

39:37.959 --> 39:39.378
I hope you weren't offended.

39:41.171 --> 39:43.256
They started it.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.682
Have some more.

39:53.558 --> 39:57.854
Peaches are good for smokers.

40:01.691 --> 40:02.691
Okay.

40:18.125 --> 40:19.876
I was wondering...

40:21.795 --> 40:24.965
- if you could dance the waltz?
- What?

40:27.843 --> 40:29.761
I learned it in school once.

40:30.887 --> 40:31.887
Why?

40:34.391 --> 40:38.603
Just curious...
It was a stupid question.

40:41.773 --> 40:45.819
I also have a stupid thing
to tell you.

40:51.700 --> 40:56.955
You came to visit me
at the hospital with flowers.

41:00.125 --> 41:07.299
I keep thinking of it.
I guess I enjoyed your visit.

41:08.633 --> 41:11.178
I enjoyed the canned cake.

41:12.137 --> 41:17.559
Even the silly flower arrangement
was nice.

41:20.187 --> 41:24.149
I keep smiling
thinking about it.

41:25.942 --> 41:27.819
I must sound quite silly.

41:39.039 --> 41:41.166
All day long...

41:43.793 --> 41:45.754
I think about you all clay long.

41:46.963 --> 41:48.340
All day...

41:55.096 --> 41:57.849
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be saying this...

42:08.777 --> 42:12.572
- Is this the tattoo he mentioned?
- Yes.

42:15.659 --> 42:17.035
It's very pretty.

42:21.248 --> 42:22.958
- Do you want it?
- What?

44:21.368 --> 44:23.453
It's not that I know it well.

44:25.664 --> 44:27.707
In Vietnam,

44:29.584 --> 44:31.878
the American soldiers had
small radios.

44:33.213 --> 44:37.926
The music coming out of them
sounded good.

44:39.344 --> 44:41.763
I didn't understand
why people listened to it before.

44:43.807 --> 44:48.561
Appreciating classical music
is your hobby then.

44:51.648 --> 44:53.358
I wouldn't say I appreciate it.

44:55.151 --> 45:02.659
Why listen to music from
a record player that isn't even hi-fi?

45:03.034 --> 45:08.289
A music hall should at least have
Tannoy and Mcln.

45:11.793 --> 45:13.253
What's McIn?

45:15.547 --> 45:17.257
I mean, McIntosh.

45:25.849 --> 45:27.892
What's your hobby?

45:29.853 --> 45:31.479
Not having one is my hobby.

45:35.775 --> 45:36.776
What about your wife?

45:38.903 --> 45:40.530
My wife's hobby...

45:42.198 --> 45:46.286
She tends after birds.
I hate birds.

45:50.832 --> 45:52.667
The sound quality is terrible.

45:54.085 --> 45:59.591
Captain Kyung, I didn't know
you listened to music here.

45:59.632 --> 46:06.431
I'm with my training sergeant
at his favorite place.

46:08.516 --> 46:09.893
Commander...

46:10.393 --> 46:12.020
Don't you remember me?

46:18.610 --> 46:20.487
- Haksu!
- Commander!

46:22.155 --> 46:23.197
I missed you.

46:23.198 --> 46:27.201
It's been a long time.
What have you been up to?

46:27.202 --> 46:29.913
Just the same old stuff.

46:31.247 --> 46:33.124
Didn't he mention me?

46:34.751 --> 46:35.751
No.

46:37.295 --> 46:41.382
I was about to visit you tonight.
But here you are.

46:44.302 --> 46:47.806
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

46:51.267 --> 46:54.354
- Why didn't you tell me about Haksu?
- That's strange.

46:55.271 --> 46:58.858
You didn't know he was back?
I thought I told you.

46:59.943 --> 47:01.319
You didn't...

47:05.573 --> 47:08.618
You have the body of
a Western actress.

47:09.661 --> 47:11.454
Slender

47:12.288 --> 47:15.041
with a tiny waist

47:15.583 --> 47:18.086
and plump buttocks.

47:19.420 --> 47:25.176
Who is he trying
to show you off to?

47:27.011 --> 47:28.429
I guess he needs it.

47:29.597 --> 47:31.850
He's one strange husband.

47:32.767 --> 47:35.061
This is something
that would piss them off.

47:35.436 --> 47:38.982
But your husband asks
to have it worn.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.948
Does he want to
brag about you?

47:49.033 --> 47:52.078
Everyone will look at you.

47:52.203 --> 47:55.874
So what if they look?
They're strangers.

47:57.750 --> 48:00.003
If he needs it,
I'll do it for him.

48:00.420 --> 48:02.297
It's the least I can do.

48:04.340 --> 48:06.050
Please finish it on time.

48:07.176 --> 48:11.389
I warned you!
All the women will hate you!

48:19.898 --> 48:20.898
Sir!

48:20.899 --> 48:22.775
- Good evening.
- Welcome.

48:26.946 --> 48:29.824
The backswing is important
at first.

48:30.992 --> 48:35.663
Push it into the mitt
of the catcher behind you.

48:35.747 --> 48:38.582
Then bring it right up

48:38.583 --> 48:43.086
and stretch out your left arm.

48:43.087 --> 48:45.006
See?

48:45.214 --> 48:47.634
And swing...

48:50.053 --> 48:53.306
It's the swing of an athlete.

48:53.431 --> 48:59.771
It's not only great but beautiful,
isn't it honey?

49:01.147 --> 49:04.317
Yes, you're really
an all-around athlete.

49:04.776 --> 49:08.780
When I learn golf
in the future

49:08.988 --> 49:11.074
please give me lessons.

49:14.953 --> 49:19.540
Who's that lady in red?

49:25.797 --> 49:26.798
Who is it?

49:27.256 --> 49:32.135
Isn't that a crazy bitch?

49:32.136 --> 49:34.722
Bitch doesn't even come to my salon.

49:35.807 --> 49:40.227
At such an important event,
with even the chief of staff present.

49:40.228 --> 49:43.272
How dare she come
dressed like a call girl!

49:43.648 --> 49:45.108
What was she wearing?

49:47.610 --> 49:48.820
A bareback dress.

49:58.496 --> 50:03.167
From afar I thought
you were an actress.

50:03.459 --> 50:04.626
Thank you.

50:04.627 --> 50:07.629
Isn't she pretty?
Your dress paid off.

50:07.630 --> 50:08.964
You know what?

50:08.965 --> 50:13.093
My heart still flutters
when I see such a beauty.

50:13.094 --> 50:15.470
You're still young.

50:15.471 --> 50:18.474
- You think so? And not silly?
- Not at all.

50:20.685 --> 50:23.396
According to Colonel Kim,
your husband is an elite

50:23.438 --> 50:25.314
who studied in the U.S.

50:29.652 --> 50:31.029
Captain Kyung Woo-jin.

50:31.070 --> 50:35.742
Your husband is also dashing.
I can see he's very ambitious.

50:35.992 --> 50:39.411
It's an honor to meet you.
I have great respect for you.

50:39.412 --> 50:40.579
Is that so?

50:40.580 --> 50:46.210
Then can I make a request,
Captain Kang?

50:46.377 --> 50:48.378
It's Kyung, Captain Kyung.

50:48.379 --> 50:54.802
Captain Kyung,
can I have a dance with your wife?

50:55.053 --> 50:57.888
Of course.
I'll have my eyes closed tight.

50:57.889 --> 51:02.101
Look at this chap!
Joking with the chief of staff?

51:02.894 --> 51:04.645
I'll have you sent
to the guardhouse.

51:09.942 --> 51:14.405
With your husband's consent,
shall we dance?

51:15.281 --> 51:17.033
I don't know how to dance.

51:17.116 --> 51:20.286
I'm sorry,
I'll make sure I learn.

51:21.579 --> 51:23.372
She's so shy.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.333
Go out and try.

51:26.084 --> 51:27.960
Let's go!

51:28.795 --> 51:33.216
Colonel Kim, go change
the music for dancing.

51:52.026 --> 51:54.112
When did he get so drunk?

51:55.279 --> 51:58.241
Sound check, sound check.

51:58.533 --> 52:00.243
Attention!

52:01.077 --> 52:03.454
Colonel Kim Jin-pyong.

52:05.123 --> 52:10.461
I will present a song
to the chief of staff.

52:12.046 --> 52:15.716
Who asked for your song?

52:15.967 --> 52:18.136
It's dancing time.
Sing it later.

52:18.469 --> 52:22.306
I would like to dedicate
this song to the chief.

52:23.141 --> 52:24.225
For the chief!

52:25.393 --> 52:29.646
- Could you teach me how to dance?
- Play anything from Elvis.

52:29.647 --> 52:31.524
Of course.

52:40.074 --> 52:42.160
Everybody come out!

53:37.465 --> 53:39.383
I looked for you.

53:42.094 --> 53:46.015
You did that
on purpose for me?

53:49.810 --> 53:52.396
I was a bit drunk.
I'm sorry.

53:57.401 --> 53:59.070
I'm slow-witted and...

54:05.243 --> 54:06.369
Thank you.

54:59.297 --> 55:02.717
What a fox.

55:03.301 --> 55:06.262
She was throwing herself
to the chief for her husband,

55:06.470 --> 55:07.971
wasn't she?

55:07.972 --> 55:14.770
I was grateful for
stopping my drunk husband.

55:14.812 --> 55:17.356
You are so generous.

55:18.649 --> 55:24.530
I met a person
who knows the couple.

55:26.365 --> 55:30.828
That woman is
as good as a war orphan.

55:30.911 --> 55:33.873
Really? No wonder...

55:33.998 --> 55:39.669
<i>During the war,
her family fled to the mountains</i>

55:39.670 --> 55:43.841
<i>being suspected as collaborators
with the Chinese army.</i>

55:46.093 --> 55:51.724
<i>Soon her father got dysentery.</i>

55:52.475 --> 55:55.853
<i>With nothing to eat
and an ill husband,</i>

55:56.228 --> 55:59.190
<i>her mother ran away.</i>

56:00.024 --> 56:02.360
<i>Not long after,
her father died</i>

56:04.695 --> 56:07.990
<i>and the body began to rot.</i>

56:09.784 --> 56:13.621
<i>But that dreadful little child</i>

56:14.997 --> 56:17.248
<i>stayed next to the corpse
for a week</i>

56:17.249 --> 56:20.127
<i>before she came down
from the mountains.</i>

56:20.628 --> 56:24.882
That poor little thing...

56:24.924 --> 56:26.425
Some more milk?

56:27.218 --> 56:32.932
What is there to pity?
She gives me the goosebumps.

56:32.973 --> 56:37.061
Captain Kyung's mother found
the wandering girl and took her in.

56:37.645 --> 56:42.024
She grew up as their maid.

56:42.233 --> 56:46.529
- Then she grew up with her husband?
- Isn't that devious, too?

56:46.904 --> 56:50.991
Hitting on her step-brother
and later marrying him,

56:51.742 --> 56:54.078
<i>she's no ordinary person.</i>

56:54.912 --> 56:57.415
<i>Nobody was against the marriage?</i>

56:58.082 --> 57:01.252
<i>Her mother-in-law backed the marriage.</i>

57:02.086 --> 57:04.171
<i>Didn't you say
she was their maid?</i>

57:06.215 --> 57:09.593
<i>Well, I guess her mother-in-law
really likes her.</i>

57:09.844 --> 57:11.512
<i>She raised the girl
like her own.</i>

57:12.805 --> 57:13.805
<i>Later...</i>

57:14.432 --> 57:15.933
I like her, too.

57:17.268 --> 57:20.563
I guess you have something in common.
Misery loves company.

57:33.742 --> 57:39.790
Could you come to my place
and make some kimchi?

57:40.708 --> 57:41.750
What?

57:42.960 --> 57:43.878
Kimchi?

57:43.879 --> 57:46.797
I don't feel like
making it myself.

57:47.631 --> 57:48.966
I must be getting old.

57:52.470 --> 57:55.139
You can make it with me.
Let's do it together.

57:56.432 --> 58:00.311
The whole residence isn't needed
to make a little kimchi.

58:03.481 --> 58:04.607
I guess you don't want to.

58:07.109 --> 58:09.028
- Then I'll do it myself.
- No.

58:13.824 --> 58:17.828
I was wondering about
what kind of salted fish to use.

58:18.496 --> 58:20.956
Should I also make white kimchi?

58:21.749 --> 58:23.501
Just get it done.

58:25.252 --> 58:29.215
Don't bother me
about the details.

58:31.842 --> 58:33.636
I'll also make white kimchi.

58:35.304 --> 58:38.640
Un, deux, trois...

58:38.641 --> 58:41.519
Un, deux, trios...

58:42.561 --> 58:43.687
Not again!

58:44.355 --> 58:46.523
Relax the shoulders.

58:46.524 --> 58:49.400
And the most important thing
is love.

58:49.401 --> 58:55.324
Without it, it's not a dance.
You're not giving me love.

58:58.077 --> 59:03.164
- But what's un, deux, trois?
- It's French for one, two, three.

59:03.165 --> 59:07.086
We use French for cultural things.
Now, along with the rhythm...

59:08.837 --> 59:12.215
It would be better with music.

59:12.216 --> 59:15.843
You're not
at that stage yet.

59:15.844 --> 59:19.390
I have to be strict at first.
Now hold me.

59:23.435 --> 59:27.146
Un, deux, trois,

59:27.147 --> 59:31.360
un, deux, trois...
Good! That's right, you can do it!

59:31.986 --> 59:34.655
Wait, nature calls.

59:36.865 --> 59:38.074
What do I always say?

59:38.075 --> 59:42.245
You improve most
when practicing by yourself.

59:42.246 --> 59:48.002
Try to feel it.
You've gotten better, good!

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:45.392
Can you feel it?
I'm half a beat later than you.

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:51.190
This is the key.
The man leads the woman.

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:54.109
You have talent, Commander.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:57.821
Feels good to be complimented.

01:00:59.198 --> 01:01:02.618
I think you like someone.

01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:07.998
I can see it as a dance teacher.
If not, I apologize.

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:16.507
Does it show?

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:21.095
How can it not show?
Your body is full of life.

01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:23.721
Again...

01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:27.225
Yes, sir.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:30.354
Un, deux, trios.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:57.338
So you boil it like this?

01:01:57.339 --> 01:02:02.803
No, later you'll see
the water going up.

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:06.557
And the coffee will brew.

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:09.518
The aroma is so good.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:13.897
This is so amazing!
I just love this atmosphere!

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:17.443
It's like
I'm in an American coffee shop.

01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:20.362
- So this glass...
- It's hot.

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.242
Wow, it's really going up!

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:30.998
My uncle in the U.S.
sends me coffee.

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:32.708
I'm so picky.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:37.421
<i>I want to see you,
outside.</i>

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.681
My husband is smoking again.

01:02:47.723 --> 01:02:50.808
This house is clean and nice
'cause nobody smokes.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:54.020
Isn't that right, Ga-heun?
He needs to quit.

01:02:54.021 --> 01:02:56.939
- The coffee...
- Is it brewing?

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.233
Can you see it dripping?

01:03:01.487 --> 01:03:03.488
This is really wonderful!

01:03:03.489 --> 01:03:08.367
Oh my goodness, it's amazing!
So can we drink it now?

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:11.078
It's still too light so wait.

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:17.960
Then I'll prepare the cookies.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:21.006
<i>Tomorrow at two,
Chinese Cathedral</i>

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:28.180
- We can drink it now.
- Really?

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:33.685
Isn't the aroma really nice?

01:03:35.771 --> 01:03:37.773
Where are the napkins?

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:50.053
My heart won't stop beating.

01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:52.806
Is it because
you're holding my hand?

01:05:02.316 --> 01:05:04.318
I like your hand.

01:05:06.987 --> 01:05:12.075
I wanted to touch it
while we were dining.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.377
Commander,
this is Jin-pyong.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:55.465
The branch in your left hand.

01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:58.844
And hold the scissors.

01:08:59.553 --> 01:09:04.015
Hold it and
make a diagonal cut.

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:07.227
Put it in the front.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:13.733
After placing it...

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:20.740
The U.S. advisory group
is comin' to Seoul.

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:26.955
And I'll be their
translator and guide.

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:29.916
- Isn't that somethin'?
- That is something.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.169
At the party before...

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:36.131
The corps commander
must've been smitten by me.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:41.553
And the colonel
recommended me, too.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:43.846
The colonel?

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:48.935
Yep, I reckon he likes me.

01:09:50.187 --> 01:09:52.522
I have go on up
for preparations.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:58.486
I'll be gone
for a few days or more.

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:02.365
Okie dokie?
I'm off.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:18.757
Who is it?

01:10:20.634 --> 01:10:21.551
It's me.

01:10:21.552 --> 01:10:24.721
I'm not going to open the door.

01:10:26.765 --> 01:10:27.765
What?

01:10:28.642 --> 01:10:31.811
I don't think I should open.

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:40.153
Is something wrong?
Open up for a minute.

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:51.706
Why, all of a sudden?

01:10:55.085 --> 01:10:59.422
You did it on purpose.

01:11:00.674 --> 01:11:02.259
Sending my husband away...

01:11:09.808 --> 01:11:11.768
I wanted to be alone with you.

01:11:17.274 --> 01:11:24.239
I'm so confused,
my head is about to burst.

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:28.451
This is wrong.

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:30.287
What we're doing...

01:11:36.084 --> 01:11:37.210
And this...

01:11:38.962 --> 01:11:43.049
I shouldn't keep it.
I'll give it back.

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:46.469
I'm sorry.

01:12:04.237 --> 01:12:08.825
The Yankees are really something.
They're actually going to the moon.

01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:17.166
Going to the moon, yet losing
to the Vietcong in flip-flops...

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:19.085
That's a mystery.

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:21.004
Why are you drinking so much?

01:12:22.881 --> 01:12:25.175
Are you mad at me?

01:12:26.051 --> 01:12:27.051
Why?

01:12:27.344 --> 01:12:31.222
I didn't tell you about Haksu
and the dance lessons...

01:12:32.432 --> 01:12:39.396
Actually, Haksu arranges
stereo imports for me

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:44.319
but it seems like
he's smuggling things in.

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:51.743
That's why I didn't mention him
to you before.

01:12:56.831 --> 01:13:01.378
What's wrong with this?

01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:02.462
Better.

01:13:13.515 --> 01:13:15.141
I like someone.

01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:20.188
Now you're joking with me.

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:29.030
Who is she?

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:35.578
The wife of a subordinate.

01:13:38.957 --> 01:13:41.292
But she won't meet me anymore.

01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:45.713
I know I shouldn't,

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:49.008
but I miss her like crazy.

01:14:01.396 --> 01:14:02.397
Did you?

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:10.405
I can't say.

01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:12.907
I see you did.

01:14:14.242 --> 01:14:16.911
Make that your last.
You're not that kind of a person.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.125
They're landing.

01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:27.630
Shit, there's nothing.

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:31.551
Using all that money
to go to such a place...

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.514
This is fuckin' vain.

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:54.449
That was fast.

01:14:54.782 --> 01:14:56.742
What brings you here?

01:14:56.743 --> 01:14:59.953
Your wife asked me to check on you.

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:06.836
I brought seaweed soup
for your birthday tomorrow.

01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:12.133
If you didn't have dinner,
we can warm it up for you now.

01:15:13.343 --> 01:15:15.929
No, I'll eat it
in the morning.

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:19.556
Thank you.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:21.437
- We'll warm it up for you.
- We can warm it up.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.378
It's also your birthday today.

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:40.555
It's seaweed soup.
Have some.

01:17:00.867 --> 01:17:02.994
I can't sleep or even breathe.

01:17:08.333 --> 01:17:10.126
It's so painful.

01:17:15.632 --> 01:17:16.632
It feels as though...

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:20.762
as though my life
has been a waste.

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:26.643
I didn't know
I was such a fool.

01:17:42.784 --> 01:17:45.119
I had the same thought.

01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:50.041
What kind of thought?

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:56.297
Wish my husband is away.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:59.342
Wish I can be with you.

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:01.511
That kind.

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:10.353
But since you made it real,

01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:14.649
I got scared.

01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:18.403
And confused.

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:26.619
I apologize.

01:18:28.413 --> 01:18:29.539
Even I...

01:18:32.542 --> 01:18:34.127
don't feel like myself.

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.344
You really...

01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:47.098
couldn't breathe?

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:58.568
What you said...
made me very happy.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:02.739
That you couldn't breathe.

01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:08.411
I thought it was just me.

01:19:27.472 --> 01:19:29.766
I shouldn't be in this room.

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:37.607
I imagined this.

01:19:40.026 --> 01:19:41.569
Being with you.

01:19:43.112 --> 01:19:45.031
In this room.

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:04.884
Is this where you were shot?

01:20:05.176 --> 01:20:06.176
Yes.

01:20:07.094 --> 01:20:09.138
How did it feel?

01:20:10.097 --> 01:20:11.265
It hurt.

01:20:17.939 --> 01:20:19.106
What about you?

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:23.194
It hurt, too.

01:23:28.796 --> 01:23:30.589
- Frag out!
- Frag out!

01:24:00.202 --> 01:24:03.038
<i>Closed for Today</i>

01:24:03.039 --> 01:24:06.042
<i>I don't agree with you,
but have a good time...</i>

01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:08.878
<i>Polaroid instructions.</i>

01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:39.575
I forgot everything.

01:24:40.076 --> 01:24:41.660
I've just started learning.

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:56.759
Un, deux, trios...

01:24:58.844 --> 01:25:02.723
- What's un, deux, trois?
- It's French.

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.940
You're really good.

01:27:44.635 --> 01:27:50.140
You asked me what's it's like
with my husband?

01:27:53.811 --> 01:27:55.938
When I was about 13...

01:27:58.190 --> 01:28:01.110
He dragged me up to the attic.

01:28:04.530 --> 01:28:08.826
It was so bright there.

01:28:12.121 --> 01:28:14.206
He stripped me,

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:17.209
and touched me.

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:20.129
Too painfully.

01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:25.134
Must have been bad.

01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:30.097
I didn't feel anything.

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:31.974
But...

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:35.227
he was rather shocked.

01:28:37.604 --> 01:28:39.648
But now that we're married,

01:28:40.691 --> 01:28:42.985
I hate being touched.

01:28:51.994 --> 01:28:53.162
So I actually

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:57.666
can't compare.

01:28:59.376 --> 01:29:01.128
You're the one,

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:03.172
and only.

01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:06.842
My universe.

01:29:26.612 --> 01:29:28.197
It's me. How are things?

01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:32.617
<i>Everybody's taking it easy.
How is your cold?</i>

01:29:32.618 --> 01:29:36.120
Ah, much better now.

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:39.624
<i>Captain Kyung's mother-in-law
is in the hospital.</i>

01:29:39.625 --> 01:29:40.917
What?

01:29:40.918 --> 01:29:44.170
<i>I went to tell his wife
but she wasn't home.</i>

01:29:44.171 --> 01:29:47.049
<i>It seemed serious.</i>

01:29:58.602 --> 01:29:59.686
Mother...

01:30:00.729 --> 01:30:06.735
You're here early.
I called her.

01:30:07.069 --> 01:30:10.656
I was shaking all over

01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:15.368
but I couldn't get to you.
So I called everyone.

01:30:15.369 --> 01:30:17.954
She had a stomach cramp.

01:30:17.955 --> 01:30:20.749
But it's not serious.

01:30:23.877 --> 01:30:25.462
But who is...?

01:30:27.381 --> 01:30:29.258
He's the training commander.

01:30:29.425 --> 01:30:30.509
Isn't he...

01:30:31.969 --> 01:30:33.345
so handsome?

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:38.434
We must have something
with hospitals.

01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:40.269
Always meeting in hospitals.

01:30:41.979 --> 01:30:48.609
It hurt so much here...

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.612
How did you come together?

01:30:51.447 --> 01:30:57.161
It was an emergency
so I asked him to drive me here.

01:30:59.913 --> 01:31:01.707
I apologize for the trouble.

01:31:03.584 --> 01:31:07.795
Not at all.
Then I'll leave you...

01:31:07.796 --> 01:31:12.967
No, I don't have anything to do.
So I can stay here.

01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:19.141
Could you wait for a moment
and drive her back?

01:31:45.501 --> 01:31:46.668
Is he the one?

01:31:47.836 --> 01:31:48.712
What?

01:31:48.754 --> 01:31:51.507
The one you like.
Is it him?

01:31:54.551 --> 01:31:56.637
I felt it last time.

01:31:58.013 --> 01:32:00.516
That you are into someone.

01:32:04.770 --> 01:32:06.355
I'm sorry.

01:32:06.438 --> 01:32:07.940
Don't say such thing.

01:32:09.107 --> 01:32:11.360
It's not a sin to like someone.

01:32:15.364 --> 01:32:19.326
You know what I'm really
sorry about?

01:32:21.036 --> 01:32:23.539
Marrying you to an evil man.

01:32:24.623 --> 01:32:26.124
Mother...

01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:29.253
My son is evil.

01:32:29.545 --> 01:32:33.090
Looks fine, but he is bad.

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:36.009
That's why I relied on you.

01:32:39.137 --> 01:32:40.806
When you're a daughter to me.

01:32:42.933 --> 01:32:45.102
Aren't I evil too?

01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:56.321
Your mother-in-law
must have thought it strange

01:32:58.407 --> 01:32:59.783
that I drove you there.

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:05.038
She knew the moment she saw you

01:33:07.541 --> 01:33:09.668
that I love you.

01:33:13.589 --> 01:33:15.090
I couldn't...

01:33:17.593 --> 01:33:19.261
hide my feelings.

01:33:31.064 --> 01:33:33.567
There's no use lying.

01:33:35.444 --> 01:33:38.113
It's the first time
I'm in love.

01:33:39.906 --> 01:33:41.908
How can she not know?

01:33:44.995 --> 01:33:46.121
So...

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:50.000
what did she say?

01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:59.676
To do as I please
if I really love you.

01:34:02.471 --> 01:34:04.222
She said
she was on my side.

01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:13.774
What do I do?

01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:17.235
I love you so much.

01:34:18.862 --> 01:34:21.198
But what she said...

01:34:24.034 --> 01:34:25.786
It tears me apart.

01:34:30.666 --> 01:34:32.042
What should I do?

01:34:33.877 --> 01:34:35.962
I love you so much, but...

01:35:00.904 --> 01:35:03.115
I won't see you anymore.

01:35:04.157 --> 01:35:05.283
I mean it.

01:35:06.201 --> 01:35:07.661
I'll try.

01:35:09.413 --> 01:35:11.707
Can you also try?

01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:14.876
For me?

01:36:22.235 --> 01:36:24.111
Are you looking for something?

01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:27.699
No, it's messy so I cleaned up.

01:36:40.796 --> 01:36:45.759
I visited the Commissioner
and found her there!

01:36:46.092 --> 01:36:50.054
When I talk with the Mrs.,
she'd cut in.

01:36:50.055 --> 01:36:52.057
Each and every time.

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:09.156
What's wrong?

01:37:09.324 --> 01:37:11.493
I need to listen to music.

01:37:12.869 --> 01:37:14.203
I'll be out downtown.

01:37:14.204 --> 01:37:15.454
At this hour?

01:37:15.455 --> 01:37:18.082
Have some fruit.
You barely ate at dinner.

01:37:18.083 --> 01:37:19.459
I feel too stuffy.

01:37:20.752 --> 01:37:21.837
I'll be back.

01:37:22.128 --> 01:37:25.465
So, when do we go?

01:37:26.508 --> 01:37:27.175
Where?

01:37:27.176 --> 01:37:29.134
The Commissioner's!

01:37:29.135 --> 01:37:30.679
Did you listen at all?

01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:36.059
I don't pay visits like that.

01:37:37.686 --> 01:37:38.770
You know me.

01:37:52.325 --> 01:37:55.703
Your bosoms have changed.

01:37:55.704 --> 01:37:58.873
- No, they haven't.
- Yes, they've changed.

01:37:58.874 --> 01:38:00.416
That's strange.

01:38:00.417 --> 01:38:04.796
My hands are really sensitive.

01:38:05.797 --> 01:38:09.968
- I think I'll have to check.
- Haksu...

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:13.346
Commander.

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:17.434
Help me.

01:38:26.568 --> 01:38:27.568
What is it?

01:38:28.653 --> 01:38:29.653
Tell me.

01:38:51.551 --> 01:38:53.553
Hello, pretty!

01:38:56.556 --> 01:38:58.808
I love Yankee stuff.

01:39:03.313 --> 01:39:05.523
Who's there?

01:39:05.607 --> 01:39:09.486
- Good evening, sir.
- Put out the lights!

01:39:09.694 --> 01:39:13.072
We heard you smuggled
military goods in that container.

01:39:13.073 --> 01:39:17.786
This went through customs.
Turn off the lights!

01:39:18.828 --> 01:39:20.914
We'll just check it.

01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:24.626
Come and check it then.

01:39:26.628 --> 01:39:29.005
I can't believe this!

01:39:31.633 --> 01:39:32.633
Stop right there!

01:39:34.636 --> 01:39:36.221
Stop, you son of a bitch!

01:39:36.846 --> 01:39:40.141
- I said it really ain't me!
- How can I believe you?

01:39:40.642 --> 01:39:45.312
Your father's smuggling
caused me grief all my life.

01:39:45.313 --> 01:39:47.899
It really ain't me, ma...

01:39:48.274 --> 01:39:56.274
I've asked for lil' stuff
like cosmetics and cigarettes for gifts.

01:39:56.574 --> 01:39:59.703
How can I smuggle in
a whole container?

01:39:59.995 --> 01:40:02.496
I ain't got the money!

01:40:02.497 --> 01:40:06.668
- You must've borrowed it.
- Borrow money? Me?

01:40:08.837 --> 01:40:09.837
Hey.

01:40:10.839 --> 01:40:13.174
Say something!

01:40:15.301 --> 01:40:19.681
Then what about your name
and the list of items?

01:40:19.764 --> 01:40:21.224
I ain't got a clue.

01:40:23.601 --> 01:40:28.481
I never heard of the fuckin'
Myeongil trading company.

01:40:30.692 --> 01:40:32.235
This is...

01:40:33.194 --> 01:40:34.821
Strange.

01:40:36.156 --> 01:40:37.365
Somethin's fishy.

01:40:41.161 --> 01:40:44.122
So are you going to jail?

01:40:44.664 --> 01:40:46.583
I dunno, fuck!

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:54.924
They'll let me off
if I volunteer for Vietnam.

01:40:55.216 --> 01:40:57.385
But I just came back...

01:41:05.727 --> 01:41:10.398
Ma... you know I was
just about to get it going.

01:41:13.443 --> 01:41:18.031
This ain't right.
This is a setup!

01:41:35.006 --> 01:41:38.927
It wasn't him, was it?

01:41:40.762 --> 01:41:41.805
No...

01:41:41.846 --> 01:41:47.268
He's lied to me many times,
just like his dad

01:41:47.769 --> 01:41:50.480
so I know when he's lying.

01:41:51.147 --> 01:41:54.192
But this time he's not.

01:41:55.652 --> 01:41:57.529
It's a setup.

01:41:59.781 --> 01:42:03.493
I think somehow
this is linked to you.

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:06.996
- Mother, I...
- Don't say a word.

01:42:07.914 --> 01:42:10.667
Get him out.

01:43:46.554 --> 01:43:49.682
How gorgeous!

01:43:49.766 --> 01:43:53.144
Madam, you look just like
Sophia Loren!

01:43:53.394 --> 01:43:56.188
With that body anything will fit.

01:43:56.189 --> 01:43:58.775
It looks so good on you.

01:43:59.025 --> 01:44:04.655
What's with calling me Madam?
Just be comfortable as before.

01:44:04.656 --> 01:44:08.242
What do you mean? To the new
training commander's wife?

01:44:08.243 --> 01:44:11.788
- One, two, three...
- Madam!

01:44:12.497 --> 01:44:14.748
Please!

01:44:14.749 --> 01:44:19.170
What happens to
Colonel Kim now?

01:44:22.298 --> 01:44:24.050
He's waiting to be assigned.

01:44:24.592 --> 01:44:27.262
It actually means
they want him to quit.

01:44:27.512 --> 01:44:30.223
What's the reason? Wasn't he
at the top of the line?

01:44:31.224 --> 01:44:35.770
Being so tight-lipped
I never told you,

01:44:35.979 --> 01:44:39.107
but every high-ranking official knows.

01:44:40.650 --> 01:44:44.320
He's on medication.

01:44:45.446 --> 01:44:48.366
A mentally ill person
can't command a troop.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.203
He treated
his subordinates well.

01:44:52.287 --> 01:44:56.541
He saved Captain Kyung.
Captain Kyung must be really sad.

01:44:57.834 --> 01:45:01.087
Captain Kyung?
He didn't look sad.

01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:03.589
He does all of my housework
these clays.

01:45:04.382 --> 01:45:06.467
He's even ready
to do my laundry.

01:45:07.885 --> 01:45:09.137
My my.

01:45:10.388 --> 01:45:12.390
What use is a war hero?

01:45:13.975 --> 01:45:15.476
And that

01:45:16.394 --> 01:45:18.146
Colonel Kim fellow...

01:45:19.314 --> 01:45:21.566
is weak at human relations.

01:45:26.571 --> 01:45:28.406
Do you need to call him that?

01:45:32.368 --> 01:45:34.495
You look pathetic right now.

01:45:51.179 --> 01:45:52.179
What?

01:45:52.805 --> 01:45:56.517
Should have sent a better present
to the Commissioner.

01:45:57.602 --> 01:46:02.690
You stupid fool.

01:46:03.024 --> 01:46:05.568
Anyway, Colonel fellow.

01:46:06.194 --> 01:46:08.821
He's over.

01:46:16.079 --> 01:46:17.288
Is it your stuff?

01:46:18.539 --> 01:46:19.539
Yes.

01:46:22.043 --> 01:46:24.295
- I'm sorry.
- There's nothing to be sorry for.

01:46:27.548 --> 01:46:29.509
My father told me as a child

01:46:31.344 --> 01:46:34.764
never to bring
your work stuff home

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:37.517
because it made you look
very shabby.

01:46:39.185 --> 01:46:42.397
- But I broke that promise.
- You don't look a bit shabby.

01:46:43.815 --> 01:46:46.109
- I'll wash up.
- Wait...

01:46:51.572 --> 01:46:58.829
Happy promotion to you!
Happy promotion to you!

01:46:58.830 --> 01:47:04.000
Dear Commodore!

01:47:04.001 --> 01:47:10.258
Happy promotion to you!

01:47:13.428 --> 01:47:14.428
What is this?

01:47:17.265 --> 01:47:20.434
You've been promoted to
a general.

01:47:20.435 --> 01:47:21.685
Congratulations!

01:47:21.686 --> 01:47:24.020
Congratulation, General!

01:47:24.021 --> 01:47:27.107
General! General!

01:47:27.108 --> 01:47:30.403
The president gave special orders
for this promotion.

01:47:31.654 --> 01:47:32.654
What?

01:47:33.114 --> 01:47:36.492
The president, himself?

01:47:37.118 --> 01:47:40.288
The president visited Vietnam
and the front line.

01:47:40.496 --> 01:47:46.835
My husband briefed him
but it was too noisy.

01:47:46.836 --> 01:47:49.505
And as you all know,
Colonel Kim has a small voice.

01:47:51.048 --> 01:47:52.967
I like that voice.

01:47:54.093 --> 01:47:59.640
The president said
â€œSpeak up, I can't hear you.â€

01:48:00.141 --> 01:48:03.394
My husband said
â€œMy voice cracks if I speak louder.

01:48:03.728 --> 01:48:07.356
And I'll look like a fool
to my subordinates.â€

01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:12.235
How about a drink?

01:48:12.236 --> 01:48:16.157
He talked back to the president.

01:48:16.449 --> 01:48:21.329
But the president
brought up his chair nearer.

01:48:22.705 --> 01:48:24.248
So nobody could say anything.

01:48:27.919 --> 01:48:32.256
The president
must have remembered my husband.

01:48:32.924 --> 01:48:36.135
So he gave special orders.

01:48:36.344 --> 01:48:37.386
Right, honey?

01:48:38.596 --> 01:48:46.312
Truth indeed wins out in the long run.
Everything is set right in the end.

01:48:48.022 --> 01:48:53.735
We felt so bad
being the only ones promoted.

01:48:53.736 --> 01:48:56.280
That's okay.

01:48:58.449 --> 01:49:02.745
The Assistant Chief of Staff
is a key post,

01:49:03.037 --> 01:49:05.081
mostly for two-star officers.

01:49:06.082 --> 01:49:07.583
This is incredible!

01:49:08.042 --> 01:49:11.546
- Let's have a toast!
- Wait...

01:49:12.463 --> 01:49:17.051
- I prepared some barbecue.
- Captain Kyung!

01:49:17.718 --> 01:49:21.097
Congratulations, Commodore Kim!
You're the best.

01:49:22.431 --> 01:49:23.683
So impressive!

01:49:24.725 --> 01:49:25.935
Why don't you make a toast.

01:49:31.065 --> 01:49:35.778
I have another announcement.
It's nothing big,

01:49:35.945 --> 01:49:38.781
but I'm pregnant.

01:49:47.290 --> 01:49:50.585
My husband didn't know.
I wanted to be careful.

01:49:51.168 --> 01:49:56.090
You can congratulate me.
I'm finally becoming a mother.

01:49:57.300 --> 01:49:58.300
Congratulations!

01:50:02.805 --> 01:50:04.432
Congratulations!

01:50:08.144 --> 01:50:10.479
It's a double celebration.
She's pregnant!

01:50:21.782 --> 01:50:25.994
Rumors had it you'd lost your lead,

01:50:25.995 --> 01:50:28.664
but I believed in you.

01:50:28.956 --> 01:50:30.206
So did I!

01:50:30.207 --> 01:50:32.125
Me, too!

01:50:32.126 --> 01:50:39.299
He's a Vietnam War hero
and the military academy's top student!

01:50:39.300 --> 01:50:44.305
Nobody can win over the Commodore.
I guarantee!

01:50:46.474 --> 01:50:48.559
Nobody!

01:50:51.979 --> 01:50:56.817
Commodore, don't forget me
even if you leave!

01:51:43.531 --> 01:51:44.824
Why are you outside?

01:51:47.451 --> 01:51:49.870
It's more comfortable here.

01:51:51.956 --> 01:51:55.334
Why are you drinking so much?

01:52:02.299 --> 01:52:03.884
I told Captain Kyung.

01:52:05.094 --> 01:52:06.094
What?

01:52:06.303 --> 01:52:11.142
To come with me to Seoul,
as my aide-de-camp.

01:52:13.352 --> 01:52:15.187
I'm going to treat him well

01:52:19.316 --> 01:52:21.652
because I've committed a great sin.

01:52:32.496 --> 01:52:33.748
But...

01:52:38.461 --> 01:52:39.879
I'm not going.

01:52:44.258 --> 01:52:45.384
Why not...

01:52:45.885 --> 01:52:47.052
Because then...

01:52:49.597 --> 01:52:51.474
I'll meet you.

01:52:53.684 --> 01:52:54.935
Why can't we meet?

01:52:57.813 --> 01:53:00.775
I told you,
I'm not seeing you anymore.

01:53:00.858 --> 01:53:02.318
Then what about me?

01:53:03.277 --> 01:53:04.987
I have no choice.

01:53:06.489 --> 01:53:08.240
They need more barbecue.

01:53:13.287 --> 01:53:15.456
- Stop, he sees us.
- Talk to me!

01:53:17.166 --> 01:53:18.459
What about me?

01:53:18.501 --> 01:53:23.005
You've clone well,
and will continue to do so.

01:53:33.891 --> 01:53:37.520
Thanks a lot, darling.

01:53:39.563 --> 01:53:40.815
Then why?

01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:45.151
If you were going to
dump me like this

01:53:45.152 --> 01:53:47.195
why did you make me want you?

01:53:47.196 --> 01:53:48.655
Are you drunk?

01:53:48.656 --> 01:53:49.490
Answer me!

01:53:49.491 --> 01:53:51.158
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:53:51.408 --> 01:53:52.451
You don't know?

01:53:53.202 --> 01:53:54.328
Don't know?

01:53:55.496 --> 01:53:57.623
Why are you dumping me?

01:53:57.665 --> 01:53:59.667
You're drunk, it hurts.
Let me go.

01:54:00.042 --> 01:54:02.253
Answer me,
why did you...

01:54:02.628 --> 01:54:03.962
- Stop it, sir.
- Let go.

01:54:03.963 --> 01:54:05.713
Why don't you stop it.

01:54:05.714 --> 01:54:06.714
What?

01:54:08.133 --> 01:54:11.345
You little weasel!
Shitty son of a bitch!

01:54:13.264 --> 01:54:14.806
- Come here!
- Colonel!

01:54:14.807 --> 01:54:17.851
- Come here!
- Hold him!

01:54:17.852 --> 01:54:20.312
Let go!

01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:23.774
Bring her here!

01:54:25.359 --> 01:54:28.529
- Let go, you shit heads!
- Take him to his room.

01:54:29.154 --> 01:54:33.617
Let go, come back!
Let go, you assholes!

01:54:38.289 --> 01:54:41.876
I knew it
from the beginning.

01:54:53.971 --> 01:54:54.972
Bottoms up.

01:55:06.609 --> 01:55:10.195
Go to Vietnam for a year.

01:55:11.363 --> 01:55:16.911
They'll know,
but it'll be better than here.

01:55:18.078 --> 01:55:19.204
I'm sorry.

01:55:19.914 --> 01:55:21.540
Don't be sorry.

01:55:22.333 --> 01:55:24.125
There's a Japanese saying

01:55:24.126 --> 01:55:25.961
that you can find no fault
below the belt.

01:55:27.630 --> 01:55:30.507
A man can make mistakes.

01:55:31.425 --> 01:55:34.094
Do some reflection in Vietnam.

01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:40.851
Don't you like Vietnam?

01:55:41.769 --> 01:55:45.606
You were a hero.
So it must fit you.

01:55:50.444 --> 01:55:53.113
You humiliated my daughter,
son of a bitch!

01:56:04.083 --> 01:56:05.793
She's even pregnant.

01:56:06.877 --> 01:56:10.172
You jerk,
you were almost there!

01:56:13.425 --> 01:56:15.010
Stupid son of a bitch.

01:56:16.929 --> 01:56:21.892
Sook-jin says she'll see you
when you're back. Just pack and leave.

01:56:22.810 --> 01:56:25.479
I'll take care of the rest.

01:56:27.982 --> 01:56:29.608
Pathetic bastard.

01:57:34.757 --> 01:57:37.134
I have something to say
to Captain Kyung.

01:57:40.387 --> 01:57:42.848
He left for Seoul.

01:57:50.564 --> 01:57:52.649
I need to
apologize to you, too.

01:57:56.904 --> 01:57:58.072
I'm sorry.

01:58:03.619 --> 01:58:05.037
I heard...

01:58:07.414 --> 01:58:09.249
you were going to Vietnam.

01:58:15.255 --> 01:58:17.049
Be safe.

01:58:21.178 --> 01:58:22.429
Good-bye.

01:58:25.099 --> 01:58:26.099
Wait...

01:58:27.351 --> 01:58:30.687
I just want to ask you
one thing.

01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:33.148
Don't worry.

01:58:35.275 --> 01:58:36.275
Okay.

01:58:42.783 --> 01:58:43.951
Did you...

01:58:48.664 --> 01:58:49.832
love me?

01:58:58.715 --> 01:58:59.716
Do you still...

01:59:01.802 --> 01:59:03.637
love me now?

01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:09.268
I...

01:59:12.563 --> 01:59:14.106
I love you.

01:59:24.741 --> 01:59:28.829
In fact,
I'm not leaving for Vietnam.

01:59:30.497 --> 01:59:32.666
I can't stay in the military
like this.

01:59:32.791 --> 01:59:33.959
Then what?

01:59:35.544 --> 01:59:39.506
While serving in Vietnam,
I visited Thailand.

01:59:42.134 --> 01:59:43.844
There was this beach...

01:59:45.679 --> 01:59:49.391
It was so peaceful and nice
I vowed I'd come again.

01:59:50.392 --> 01:59:52.019
I'm going there.

01:59:52.477 --> 01:59:53.687
Don't.

01:59:54.396 --> 01:59:57.858
Nobody will remember this
after a year.

01:59:59.359 --> 02:00:00.359
No...

02:00:01.361 --> 02:00:02.988
This is the right decision.

02:00:04.531 --> 02:00:05.824
So I was wondering...

02:00:07.701 --> 02:00:10.037
if you could go with me?

02:00:11.872 --> 02:00:17.044
You don't have to answer now.
You can join me later.

02:00:18.545 --> 02:00:20.631
I'll write you.

02:00:23.217 --> 02:00:25.969
So join me later?

02:00:30.432 --> 02:00:33.560
I won't ruin you again.

02:00:34.853 --> 02:00:36.146
And...

02:00:36.563 --> 02:00:41.109
I can't give up everything.

02:00:44.112 --> 02:00:45.405
I don't love you enough.

02:00:55.123 --> 02:00:56.291
I see...

02:01:00.212 --> 02:01:03.423
I didn't know.
You should've told me sooner.

02:01:04.758 --> 02:01:07.761
- I'm sorry. Bye.
- Wait!

02:01:09.930 --> 02:01:11.306
Wait...

02:01:13.267 --> 02:01:14.601
You know what...

02:01:18.647 --> 02:01:19.815
Actually...

02:01:23.735 --> 02:01:25.696
I can't live without you.

02:01:29.324 --> 02:01:30.701
I can't sleep.

02:01:32.244 --> 02:01:34.454
I can't eat and...

02:01:37.082 --> 02:01:38.625
I can't breathe.

02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:48.385
It's so suffocating
I can't live.

02:03:10.926 --> 02:03:14.346
Then there's no pension?

02:03:15.222 --> 02:03:19.017
Of course,
he was dishonorably discharged.

02:03:19.768 --> 02:03:22.646
Divorced and
dishonorably discharged...

02:03:24.189 --> 02:03:26.441
The poor Colonel...

02:03:26.566 --> 02:03:30.570
What's to pity?
It's a miracle he didn't die.

02:03:31.238 --> 02:03:34.241
He missed his heart
by a centimeter.

02:03:34.324 --> 02:03:37.035
She surely lived life
to the fullest.

02:03:37.744 --> 02:03:45.502
I can't imagine
having a man die for me.

02:03:46.628 --> 02:03:51.341
Do you think you would
follow a man like that?

02:03:52.926 --> 02:03:55.679
Are you crazy?
That's nonsense...

02:04:04.938 --> 02:04:06.231
What about you?

02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:20.954
<i>Two years later - Winter of 1971</i>

02:04:34.468 --> 02:04:36.678
Someone is here for you.

02:05:16.676 --> 02:05:17.676
Ma'am...

02:05:22.766 --> 02:05:25.227
Are you the wife of
Major Kyung Woo-jin?

02:05:26.353 --> 02:05:28.188
I'm Jong Ga-heun.

02:05:29.147 --> 02:05:30.524
What's the matter?

02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:35.529
The woman in this photo...

02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:38.865
Is it you?

02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:42.202
<i>September 26, 1969
Renaissance Music Hall</i>

02:05:46.039 --> 02:05:47.123
This photo...

02:05:48.959 --> 02:05:51.211
We're from Vietnam.

02:05:52.546 --> 02:05:58.552
That man guided the special forces
across the Laos border.

02:06:00.387 --> 02:06:04.391
He was neither a soldier
nor a civilian.

02:06:05.225 --> 02:06:06.545
During an infiltration operation,

02:06:07.978 --> 02:06:11.022
he was shot and died.

02:06:17.279 --> 02:06:18.446
But...

02:06:19.072 --> 02:06:21.408
nobody knew his identity.

02:06:24.077 --> 02:06:25.579
He had no belongings.

02:06:26.204 --> 02:06:29.040
All he had was this photo
in his pocket.

02:06:32.085 --> 02:06:37.465
I asked around everywhere
to return this to you.

02:06:39.634 --> 02:06:40.760
Ma'am...

02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:43.888
Look behind it.

02:06:53.648 --> 02:06:57.152
<i>My Love</i>

02:07:06.369 --> 02:07:12.333
Right before he died,
he kept on pulling at his pocket.

02:07:12.334 --> 02:07:14.214
So we took out this photo...
wrapped in plastic.

02:07:16.296 --> 02:07:18.256
He died looking at this.

02:07:19.507 --> 02:07:20.592
He even smiled.

02:07:26.973 --> 02:07:32.812
<i>Jong Ga-heun</i>

02:08:20.235 --> 02:08:22.362
Let me write my name here.

02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.658
Don't forget me 'til you die.

02:08:28.827 --> 02:08:30.036
Promise?

02:08:43.091 --> 02:08:44.217
I'll never forget.

02:09:31.848 --> 02:09:38.938
OBSESSED

02:09:42.776 --> 02:09:43.902
You look scared.

02:09:44.903 --> 02:09:46.321
Take it easy.
