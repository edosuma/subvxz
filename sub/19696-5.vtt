WEBVTT

00:00.031 --> 00:02.515
- All right, gotta go to work.
- Oh.

00:03.025 --> 00:06.145
- Got any plans for today?
- Oh, many.

00:06.170 --> 00:08.015
I am going to look for a second stick

00:08.039 --> 00:10.741
to match the main
stick I found yesterday.

00:11.519 --> 00:13.675
Hey, you're not so bored

00:13.700 --> 00:15.042
being left home alone all day

00:15.066 --> 00:16.599
that you're going insane, right?

00:16.668 --> 00:18.067
No. Of course not.

00:18.136 --> 00:20.490
Though I guess I'd be the last to know.

00:25.744 --> 00:27.243
- Ah...
- Yeah.

00:27.312 --> 00:29.725
So, we need to get you
into the outside world.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.118
You think you're ready for that?

00:31.143 --> 00:33.321
Yes. I would like to take a walk to town

00:33.346 --> 00:34.875
and maybe get an ice cream.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.352
That sounds great.

00:37.541 --> 00:40.290
Lucille, get out your best hat.

00:40.358 --> 00:41.874
We're going to market!

00:41.899 --> 00:44.391
Uh, what? What's that, Lucille?

00:44.508 --> 00:47.030
Oh, no. Lucille.

00:47.098 --> 00:48.465
Lucille's saying that she's tired

00:48.500 --> 00:50.661
and she wants to stay
home and take a nap.

00:52.270 --> 00:54.637
She's a stick; she can't talk.

00:55.674 --> 00:57.073
Right, but...

00:57.142 --> 00:58.374
but you... but...

01:00.468 --> 01:04.068

01:04.683 --> 01:06.392
Oh, man! Is that sushi?

01:06.417 --> 01:07.749
Yep.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.751
Oh, I've been meaning to try that.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.276
You want some?

01:11.301 --> 01:13.667
Dude, that's so nice of you.
I wasn't even thinking that.

01:13.692 --> 01:14.837
Daniel.

01:14.862 --> 01:17.826
I need to borrow $200,000, please.

01:17.861 --> 01:18.909
Okay. Why?

01:18.934 --> 01:20.112
The ice cream shop is for sale,

01:20.137 --> 01:21.706
and I'd like to buy it.

01:21.731 --> 01:23.265
Deb, that's a great idea.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.145
Chris, I need to
borrow $300,000, please.

01:26.170 --> 01:27.769
I don't have that kind of money.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.997
What are you talking about?
Yes, you do. You're rich.

01:30.022 --> 01:32.413
- I'm not rich.
- Yes, you are.

01:32.438 --> 01:34.538
You have things on your wall
that aren't movie posters.

01:34.563 --> 01:36.405
You mean art? I'm not rich.

01:36.476 --> 01:37.909
I'm actually in a lot of debt.

01:37.978 --> 01:40.418
Up until a month ago, I was
definitely gonna get tenure,

01:40.443 --> 01:42.871
so I was spending pretty irresponsibly.

01:42.916 --> 01:44.082
What happened a month ago?

01:44.150 --> 01:45.450
I met Dan.

01:45.519 --> 01:47.752
You would think a history professor

01:47.777 --> 01:49.454
with access to a time machine

01:49.523 --> 01:50.787
would be a positive thing,

01:50.812 --> 01:53.458
but instead my career's
been totally derailed.

01:53.527 --> 01:56.574
Wait. You're a history professor.

01:56.599 --> 01:58.833
You have a time machine.

01:58.974 --> 02:01.766
There's no way to turn that into money?

02:01.835 --> 02:03.668
- Hmm.
- Hey, what's this green stuff?

02:03.693 --> 02:06.271
- It's guacamole.
- Oh-ho, I love guacamole!

02:06.339 --> 02:08.133
Guac 'n' roll, baby!

02:08.158 --> 02:09.565
Yeah.

02:10.518 --> 02:12.010
Uh, Dan?

02:14.014 --> 02:16.848
Okay, guys, let's time-travel
to make some money.

02:16.917 --> 02:20.795
We are gonna bet on the
World Series of baseball.

02:21.498 --> 02:23.288
Like Back to the Future II.

02:24.092 --> 02:25.887
- What do you mean?
- Your plan.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.825
It's the same plan from the
second Back to the Future movie.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.152
I never saw those movies.

02:29.229 --> 02:30.997
- What?!
- They're quite good.

02:31.022 --> 02:33.677
Chris, you must see them. And
stealing their plan is a great idea.

02:33.702 --> 02:35.101
Nice work, Chris!

02:35.126 --> 02:37.422
Okay, except it's not stealing...

02:37.454 --> 02:39.230
because this is my own separate plan

02:39.255 --> 02:40.556
that I came up with.

02:40.581 --> 02:42.736
Oh, I see... so it's an original plan

02:42.761 --> 02:44.640
even though it's exactly the same.

02:45.394 --> 02:48.038
Yes. Now, the 1919 Series

02:48.063 --> 02:50.464
between the Chicago White
Sox and the Cincinnati Reds

02:50.489 --> 02:53.870
was already fixed, so we
won't be disturbing history

02:53.895 --> 02:55.308
by placing a bet on it.

02:55.333 --> 02:56.917
I get it, and I like it.

02:56.949 --> 02:58.282
And what's even better is,

02:58.351 --> 02:59.776
the people we'll be taking money from

02:59.801 --> 03:01.026
are bad people.

03:01.051 --> 03:02.897
Now I get it, and I like it.

03:02.922 --> 03:04.154
We're basically Robin Hood.

03:04.223 --> 03:05.816
You know, the sports
gambling world in those days

03:05.841 --> 03:07.691
was run by scumbag mobsters.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.441
- Oh, the Mafia?
- Yeah.

03:09.466 --> 03:12.292
Sweet! I love the Mafia. I
know everything about them.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.042
They're basically the best.

03:14.067 --> 03:15.566
Uh, they're violent sociopaths.

03:15.635 --> 03:17.001
Don't be such a wet blanket, Chris.

03:17.069 --> 03:19.370
They're classy and they say cool stuff.

03:19.405 --> 03:21.672
I've seen every Mafia TV show and movie.

03:21.707 --> 03:22.918
Uh, that won't be helpful.

03:22.943 --> 03:25.073
- I will make it helpful.
- It won't be.

03:25.098 --> 03:27.238
So, Chris, I've been
doing some research,

03:27.263 --> 03:29.575
and what you think is guacamole...

03:29.600 --> 03:32.090
- is actually wasabi.
- What?!

03:32.115 --> 03:34.015
It's a Japanese spice mustard.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.051
And you got to be careful
with that stuff, my friend.

03:36.076 --> 03:37.723
Yikes. Thank you for the heads-up.

03:37.748 --> 03:39.637
- Seriously.
- Hey...

03:40.226 --> 03:41.707
check it out.

03:42.107 --> 03:44.457
I got this for Deb.

03:47.933 --> 03:50.473
- It's Chicago.
- Cool.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.948
Yeah. It is cool. I don't
know if you can tell,

03:52.973 --> 03:55.372
but I haven't always had
the best luck with women.

03:55.397 --> 03:57.668
You went 200 years in the
past to get a girlfriend.

03:57.693 --> 03:59.152
Right. You know, I
think where I went wrong

03:59.177 --> 04:00.635
in my previous relationships...

04:00.680 --> 04:02.394
was that I wasn't romantic enough.

04:02.419 --> 04:04.223
And a snow globe is gonna solve that?

04:04.248 --> 04:06.533
It's not just a snow globe, Chris.

04:06.558 --> 04:07.682
Traveling through time

04:07.707 --> 04:09.481
on a romantic weekend to Chicago

04:09.506 --> 04:12.261
so I can win money and
buy that ice cream parlor

04:12.286 --> 04:14.520
and Deb can have the job of her dreams.

04:15.661 --> 04:18.153
This is a symbol of
our new life together.

04:18.582 --> 04:19.887
That's really sweet, Dan.

04:19.911 --> 04:21.690
Oh, hey, I got you something, too.

04:21.716 --> 04:24.301
Turn it upside down,
her clothes come off.

04:24.504 --> 04:26.208
Wait, why would you
think I'd be into this?

04:26.233 --> 04:27.809
Oh, well, I bought a white woman

04:27.834 --> 04:30.309
'cause I just didn't want to assume...

04:31.340 --> 04:32.585
Assume what?

04:33.901 --> 04:35.575
This feels like a minefield for me,

04:35.600 --> 04:37.825
so... you're welcome.

04:54.030 --> 04:57.532
Oh! 1919 Chicago!

04:57.600 --> 04:59.512
Ah, this is incredible!

04:59.537 --> 05:02.538
Oh, right, the past is still
kind of the future for you.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.893
You can almost feel the jazz in the air.

05:04.918 --> 05:06.215
I'm sorry, what?

05:06.240 --> 05:07.278
I never told you this,

05:07.303 --> 05:10.321
but I blow a pretty
tasty licorice stick.

05:10.346 --> 05:11.778
I'm sorry, what?

05:11.803 --> 05:13.347
Jazz clarinet, amigo.

05:13.415 --> 05:14.614
What?

05:14.639 --> 05:16.013
Okay, I've done a lot of research,

05:16.038 --> 05:18.221
and I've prepared cover
stories for each of us.

05:18.246 --> 05:20.956
I'm gonna be Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson,

05:20.981 --> 05:23.643
the notorious black mobster from Harlem.

05:23.668 --> 05:25.684
Bumpy Johnson? That's the
name you're going with?

05:25.709 --> 05:28.799
Yes. And you're gonna be
Bugsy Siegel from Murder, Inc.

05:28.824 --> 05:30.870
They should let us
place a pretty big bet

05:30.895 --> 05:32.864
based on our names and reputations.

05:32.889 --> 05:36.309
Deb, you will be Bugsy's
girlfriend, Virginia Hill.

05:36.334 --> 05:37.832
No.

05:37.864 --> 05:40.246
- What do you mean, no?
- I don't want to be just a girlfriend.

05:40.271 --> 05:42.746
- I want to be my own gangster.
- Fine.

05:42.771 --> 05:44.981
There was a stickup artist
by the name of Rose Durante...

05:45.006 --> 05:46.907
they called her the Pretty Pants Bandit.

05:46.975 --> 05:48.528
Okay. I like it.

05:48.553 --> 05:51.588
Nyeh. And I'm Bugsy Siegel! See?

05:51.613 --> 05:53.714
And I'm Rose Durante.

05:53.749 --> 05:55.848
Stick 'em up! See?

05:56.176 --> 05:58.206
Please promise me you won't
talk like that the whole trip.

05:58.231 --> 05:59.737
Not the whole trip. See?

05:59.762 --> 06:01.098
Just most of it, Jack!

06:05.729 --> 06:08.770
Do these people not
recognize Bumpy Johnson?

06:08.797 --> 06:10.356
You know, there's still
time to change the name.

06:10.381 --> 06:12.465
I like the name. I'm keeping the name.

06:12.490 --> 06:15.424
Did I, uh, hear you say
you're Bumpy Johnson?

06:15.465 --> 06:17.938
Yeah. Yeah, you heard that.

06:18.006 --> 06:20.573
And I'm looking to lay
down a big wager, too.

06:20.598 --> 06:23.557
Ah. I heard you don't
leave Harlem for nothin'.

06:23.582 --> 06:25.645
Why didn't you just
place your bet there?

06:25.681 --> 06:27.514
Yeah, why didn't I do that?

06:28.145 --> 06:31.051
Well, uh... I'm friends...

06:31.137 --> 06:32.957
with, uh, Bugsy Siegel.

06:32.982 --> 06:35.645
Everybody knows Bugsy
don't have no friends.

06:35.670 --> 06:37.575
Really?

06:37.600 --> 06:38.825
They say that, huh?

06:38.850 --> 06:40.606
I'm the Pretty Pants Bandit.

06:40.631 --> 06:43.207
I've literally never
heard those words before.

06:44.126 --> 06:45.926
Get the hell out of here.

06:47.334 --> 06:50.872
I guess my ice cream
dreams are melting away.

06:53.076 --> 06:55.009
I know Al Capone!

06:55.343 --> 06:56.876
Dan, what are you doing?

06:56.901 --> 06:58.302
That's right.

06:58.450 --> 07:00.271
I work with Al Capone.

07:00.794 --> 07:02.777
And I'm looking to put 100 large

07:02.802 --> 07:05.544
on the Reds to win the World Series.

07:05.748 --> 07:06.997
See?

07:07.382 --> 07:08.607
Yeah, I see.

07:08.632 --> 07:11.318
I mean, throwing that name around
without being able to back it up...

07:11.387 --> 07:13.551
that'd be suicide.

07:14.519 --> 07:16.770
I'll get you boys a marker.

07:16.795 --> 07:18.481
Daniel, that was amazing.

07:18.506 --> 07:19.512
Pretty smart, right?

07:19.537 --> 07:20.932
See, what I realized was

07:20.957 --> 07:22.787
we were using all the
names of New York gangsters,

07:22.812 --> 07:24.129
but, duh, we're in Chicago...

07:24.154 --> 07:25.848
we need to just use the
names of Chicago gangsters,

07:25.873 --> 07:26.973
so that's what I did.

07:26.998 --> 07:29.135
The reason I wanted to be from New York

07:29.160 --> 07:30.749
and, very specifically, not Chicago,

07:30.774 --> 07:33.209
was so that we could
avoid the homicidal maniacs

07:33.234 --> 07:34.460
we are lying about.

07:34.485 --> 07:35.632
Don't be salty, Chris,

07:35.657 --> 07:38.231
just because your PhD
means nothing here,

07:38.256 --> 07:39.788
and I know everything about
this place and these people,

07:39.813 --> 07:41.773
'cause I've seen The
Untouchables once on cable.

07:41.841 --> 07:43.007
This is really dangerous.

07:43.076 --> 07:44.758
Chris, if anything bad happens,

07:44.783 --> 07:46.377
we have a time machine.

07:46.402 --> 07:48.235
We'll be like, "Bye..."

07:48.260 --> 07:49.424
She's right.

07:49.449 --> 07:52.450
Until then, this is
basically Mafia fantasy camp.

07:53.593 --> 07:55.658
Thank you, Sweet Lou.

07:57.533 --> 07:58.856
Drink up.

07:58.925 --> 08:00.491
Oh, n-no. We didn't, um...

08:00.560 --> 08:01.993
You're with Capone.

08:02.018 --> 08:03.985
You don't have to pay for anything.

08:04.510 --> 08:06.658
I... think we're gonna like it here.

08:29.289 --> 08:30.390
Hi.

09:00.271 --> 09:01.821
How's everybody doing?

09:02.524 --> 09:04.188
Watch me for the changes.

09:04.224 --> 09:05.910
And try to keep up, okay?

09:05.935 --> 09:07.335
Oh, God.

09:20.049 --> 09:21.982
Is this "Ants Marching"?

09:22.442 --> 09:24.275
I guess you wouldn't know.

09:30.469 --> 09:32.688
Hey, Brian. It's your cousin Troy.

09:33.386 --> 09:34.719
What?

09:34.787 --> 09:37.399
Troy! Troy!

09:37.868 --> 09:39.243
Nah! Troy!

09:39.268 --> 09:40.469
Hey, never mind! Forget it!

09:40.494 --> 09:42.188
I was gonna tell you
about this new sound...

09:42.235 --> 09:43.701
No, I'm Troy!

09:45.434 --> 09:47.243
Yeah! Huh?

09:47.268 --> 09:48.839
Huh? What, now?

09:52.779 --> 09:54.922
All right.

09:56.215 --> 09:57.715
Big slam!

09:59.786 --> 10:02.228
Are you serious you've never
seen Back to the Future?

10:02.253 --> 10:04.021
Nope. Stop asking me.

10:04.329 --> 10:06.314
Here's to being debt-free.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.837
Do something exciting with
your toast opportunity...

10:08.862 --> 10:10.133
we're traveling in time.

10:10.158 --> 10:11.509
To winning!

10:11.534 --> 10:12.867
To #winning.

10:13.194 --> 10:14.493
To tiger blood.

10:14.518 --> 10:16.417
Which I guess we found
out is just AIDS blood.

10:16.442 --> 10:17.892
So, to winning!

10:17.931 --> 10:18.986
To winning.

10:19.011 --> 10:22.468
To winning money to
buy an ice cream parlor.

10:22.493 --> 10:25.463
With our bet on a crooked World Series.

10:25.488 --> 10:27.639
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Clink.

10:27.708 --> 10:29.140
Mmm.

10:30.220 --> 10:31.843
- Deb, I, uh...
- Mmm.

10:33.142 --> 10:34.779
... I got you this.

10:36.316 --> 10:38.306
It's just a little memento from...

10:38.331 --> 10:40.275
me to you to remember the trip.

10:40.300 --> 10:43.431
Oh, Daniel, it's wonderful.

10:43.939 --> 10:48.167
Daniel... no one's ever
given me something before.

10:48.902 --> 10:50.061
Oh...

10:50.097 --> 10:52.430
What did I do to deserve this?

10:52.712 --> 10:54.041
You're you.

10:55.761 --> 10:57.402
Look at the snow.

10:57.550 --> 10:59.058
Interesting fact...

10:59.091 --> 11:00.839
that's not snow, it's glitter.

11:00.907 --> 11:04.300
And they add glycerin to the
water to increase viscosity.

11:04.854 --> 11:06.197
Thanks.

11:06.222 --> 11:08.019
Thank you for keeping us all safe.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.464
I think we all would have freaked out

11:09.489 --> 11:11.621
if we thought that that
was real snow in there.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.980
Sorry to interrupt.

11:14.005 --> 11:16.298
Is it true you guys work for Al Capone?

11:16.323 --> 11:18.019
Less like work for Al Capone;

11:18.044 --> 11:19.831
more like work with Al Capone.

11:19.856 --> 11:22.422
Yeah, yeah, it's like
an equal partnership.

11:22.491 --> 11:24.624
See, buster?

11:24.649 --> 11:26.082
Eh, scram, you crumbug!

11:26.107 --> 11:27.300
Get out of here! Heh-heh.

11:27.331 --> 11:29.418
Uh, my apologies. I should've known.

11:29.443 --> 11:32.244
After all, I am Al Capone.

11:38.953 --> 11:40.285
Ugh...

11:41.695 --> 11:43.031
Mr. Capone, let me start by saying

11:43.056 --> 11:44.359
we are really, really sorry.

11:44.384 --> 11:45.756
I hope we didn't offend you at all.

11:45.781 --> 11:47.195
We'll just leave.

11:47.406 --> 11:49.898
- Would you like this snow globe?
- Oh, really?

11:49.923 --> 11:51.773
Interesting fact... if you think
that's regular water in there,

11:51.798 --> 11:53.156
no, they pumped it full of glycerin.

11:53.181 --> 11:54.437
Shut up.

11:54.462 --> 11:55.850
You're not going anywhere,

11:55.896 --> 11:57.875
until somebody tells me...

11:57.900 --> 12:00.532
why a New York crew
I've never seen before...

12:00.601 --> 12:02.513
is running around my town

12:02.538 --> 12:04.445
using... my name.

12:04.470 --> 12:06.328
There is a good explanation for it.

12:07.195 --> 12:09.062
And that explanation is that, uh,

12:09.087 --> 12:11.187
we-we-we-we do know you.

12:11.633 --> 12:14.547
You-you don't remember us,
'cause we met ten years ago,

12:14.572 --> 12:16.242
and we all look different now.

12:16.267 --> 12:18.039
I-I got fat.

12:18.064 --> 12:20.297
I gained a lot of weight,
'cause I'm a stress eater,

12:20.322 --> 12:22.422
and I've had a lot on my plate.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.024
You know, I'm picturing you skinny.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.140
Yeah. Yeah, I can see it.

12:28.165 --> 12:30.095
That would really slim down your face.

12:30.163 --> 12:31.797
Yes, I have fat face features.

12:31.822 --> 12:33.588
- Yeah, you have fat face features.
- All right.

12:33.719 --> 12:34.930
- What about them?!
- Aah!

12:34.955 --> 12:37.936
I... I changed my hair.

12:38.077 --> 12:40.703
- Hair really does make a difference.
- Yes, it does.

12:40.728 --> 12:43.631
It acts as, like, a
frame for the whole head.

12:43.656 --> 12:45.133
It does make a difference.

12:45.158 --> 12:46.282
- What did he change?!
- Oh.

12:46.307 --> 12:47.736
He actually didn't change anything.

12:47.781 --> 12:49.086
He's not memorable.

12:49.111 --> 12:51.734
I'm memorable. I play the clarinet.

12:51.818 --> 12:52.846
Wow.

12:52.871 --> 12:54.994
Even as he was saying that,
I was, like, tuning him out.

12:55.019 --> 12:56.454
Right? Right?

12:56.523 --> 12:57.555
- Right?
- Yeah.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.127
I don't know, guys.

13:02.541 --> 13:05.025
This all sounds a
little hard to believe.

13:05.129 --> 13:07.534
But you were just
believing it seconds ago.

13:07.559 --> 13:08.604
Think about it.

13:08.629 --> 13:11.594
A crew of legit gangsters,

13:11.619 --> 13:13.916
who I haven't seen in a long time,

13:13.941 --> 13:18.250
comes to town on the very
same day my normal crew...

13:18.275 --> 13:20.995
is all sick with scarlet fever?

13:21.020 --> 13:22.752
Your whole crew came down with
scarlet fever on the same day?

13:22.777 --> 13:24.502
You know what that means?!

13:24.527 --> 13:26.194
It means I don't have

13:26.219 --> 13:28.286
to cancel the stickup I planned!

13:28.322 --> 13:29.369
- Oh!
- Yay!

13:29.394 --> 13:30.580
- Whoo! Yay!
- Am I the luckiest...

13:30.605 --> 13:31.905
damn guy in the world?!

13:31.930 --> 13:33.058
Yeah!

13:33.126 --> 13:34.125
Yay!

13:39.023 --> 13:40.989
Some wiseguys have been
running a poker game

13:41.050 --> 13:42.983
without giving me a piece of the action.

13:43.008 --> 13:44.102
Those fiends.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.204
So we're gonna go in
there and take our cut...

13:46.229 --> 13:49.272
that'll teach them not to invite me.

13:49.297 --> 13:50.571
Now, Al,

13:50.596 --> 13:52.524
could you maybe, possibly...

13:52.549 --> 13:54.335
not really be mad about the money

13:54.360 --> 13:57.071
and be upset that you didn't
get invited to the poker game?

13:57.096 --> 13:58.496
Yeah.

13:58.688 --> 14:00.638
Forgettable, you're on crowd control.

14:00.663 --> 14:02.718
You go in there, and
someone tries to be a hero,

14:02.743 --> 14:03.922
you waste 'em!

14:03.947 --> 14:05.161
- What?
- Fatface!

14:05.186 --> 14:07.461
- Fatf... uh, yes, Fatface.
- Yeah, you, Fatface! Fatface.

14:07.486 --> 14:09.821
When we get in there,
you take out the bodyguard

14:09.846 --> 14:11.102
just inside the door!

14:11.127 --> 14:12.454
- Take him out, like, with a gun?
- Yeah.

14:12.479 --> 14:13.832
Shoot him in the face!

14:13.900 --> 14:15.039
Shoot him in the face?

14:15.064 --> 14:17.702
Long-hair, you are our getaway driver.

14:17.727 --> 14:20.517
Oh, then I will drive the car with my...

14:20.542 --> 14:22.141
hands and feet. I know how.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.875
Okay, well, the shifter
is a little tricky,

14:23.944 --> 14:26.511
so let me take a moment
to show you how to work it.

14:27.848 --> 14:29.848
Dude, check it out.

14:29.916 --> 14:31.274
The time machine.

14:31.299 --> 14:32.450
Put that away.

14:32.519 --> 14:33.782
What are you...

14:35.047 --> 14:36.594
Smart.

14:36.619 --> 14:38.690
A bag to carry the money.

14:38.759 --> 14:40.821
I'm always running out
with it in my hands,

14:40.846 --> 14:43.728
dropping wads everywhere
like a big galoot!

14:43.797 --> 14:46.219
Oh! That is great.

14:46.244 --> 14:47.305
- Give me this.
- Nope.

14:47.330 --> 14:48.430
- Give me this.
- No.

14:48.485 --> 14:50.194
- It's a bag for the money!
- Right.

14:50.219 --> 14:52.016
You know what? I like you guys.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.094
I really do.

14:53.119 --> 14:55.157
Okay! Keep the car running!

14:55.182 --> 14:58.533
Let's... do it!

14:58.558 --> 15:00.204
Whoo-hoo! Man!

15:00.235 --> 15:02.035
- Oops.
- Oh, yeah!

15:02.104 --> 15:05.789
So, Al Capone has our time machine.

15:05.814 --> 15:07.593
Good job, everybody.

15:07.618 --> 15:09.543
He said "oops," Chris.

15:14.946 --> 15:16.683
Well, hopefully, he's done shooting.

15:16.752 --> 15:18.391
He isn't.

15:18.415 --> 15:20.649
You think he's gonna be mad
we didn't go in there with him?

15:20.674 --> 15:22.764
Wah-hoo!

15:24.047 --> 15:25.704
Let's go!

15:25.729 --> 15:28.534
Let's move. Let's move,
move, move, move, move!

15:32.189 --> 15:34.229
Oh! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:34.254 --> 15:35.297
- It's okay.
- Oh!

15:35.322 --> 15:36.719
I'm sorry.

15:37.930 --> 15:41.125
So, I guess you guys aren't,
like, real gangsters, huh?

15:41.150 --> 15:42.438
Nope.

15:42.688 --> 15:45.071
Let's go. Come on.

15:47.453 --> 15:50.164
Come on, boys, let's
go have a little talk.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.073
Why don't you, uh, stay up here

15:52.098 --> 15:55.039
and, uh, help my dinner
lady make-a the pasta.

15:55.064 --> 15:56.305
Come on.

15:58.310 --> 16:00.172
Arms up, boys.

16:00.197 --> 16:01.766
I got to check for weapons.

16:01.829 --> 16:04.133
Come on. Turn around.

16:08.209 --> 16:09.475
Uh-oh.

16:10.738 --> 16:12.037
Oh.

16:12.477 --> 16:14.807
Hachi machi!

16:14.875 --> 16:16.375
Who's the dame?

16:16.633 --> 16:17.938
Boy, what I wouldn't give to see

16:17.963 --> 16:20.000
what's underneath
that bathing suit, huh?

16:20.025 --> 16:21.824
Turn her upside down.

16:25.157 --> 16:27.820
Hachi machi!

16:28.172 --> 16:29.855
And there's more where that came from.

16:29.924 --> 16:31.123
Really?

16:31.158 --> 16:32.499
- No.
- Why would you tell him that?

16:32.524 --> 16:33.924
No, I don't know why I said that.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.225
All right, boys,

16:35.294 --> 16:37.390
why don't you give me one good reason

16:37.415 --> 16:40.450
why I don't blow both
your brains out right now.

16:40.808 --> 16:42.089
And before you do,

16:42.114 --> 16:44.839
let me give you a list of
reasons I've heard in the past

16:44.864 --> 16:46.558
that I would prefer not to hear again.

16:46.583 --> 16:47.644
- Good?
- Yes, sir.

16:47.669 --> 16:49.714
One... "I'm getting married."

16:49.739 --> 16:53.058
Did my invitation get lost in the mail?

16:53.083 --> 16:55.729
If I'm just now hearing
about your wedding,

16:55.754 --> 16:57.628
- how do you think that makes me feel?
- Bad.

16:57.653 --> 17:01.026
Two... "I'm going to
the follies tomorrow"!

17:01.051 --> 17:03.565
All right, um... are you going alone?

17:03.605 --> 17:06.041
Do you only have one ticket?

17:07.075 --> 17:08.540
Or do you in fact...

17:08.609 --> 17:10.707
have several tickets,

17:10.732 --> 17:14.066
I just didn't even get
a courtesy phone call?

17:14.354 --> 17:17.170
They're taking an awfully long time.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.740
Al kind of tells me to keep
my nose out of his business.

17:20.809 --> 17:22.798
He called you his "dinner lady."

17:22.823 --> 17:24.377
Is that a fun job?

17:24.420 --> 17:26.166
Uh, I'm his wife.

17:26.192 --> 17:28.144
That's just what he calls me.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.082
That's terrible.

17:30.151 --> 17:31.511
All the time?

17:31.536 --> 17:34.720
Um, ever since we were
married when I was 16.

17:34.745 --> 17:35.769
What?

17:35.794 --> 17:38.378
That hasn't changed
since I was growing up?

17:39.543 --> 17:41.176
When did you grow up?

17:41.776 --> 17:43.808
The same time that you did, of course.

17:43.833 --> 17:45.448
Then why would you say it like that?

17:45.473 --> 17:47.269
Because... I thought that...

17:47.294 --> 17:49.230
when I was younger that it would change,

17:49.255 --> 17:52.371
because I am now an
adult, and that's all.

17:52.407 --> 17:55.644
Ah. I guess that is kind of strange.

17:56.979 --> 17:58.377
Tell me...

17:58.542 --> 18:00.105
what else do we both dislike

18:00.130 --> 18:02.136
about our place in modern times?

18:02.161 --> 18:03.694
Um, well...

18:03.924 --> 18:06.440
I... I guess I wish I was allowed to go

18:06.465 --> 18:08.855
to the end of my driveway
without permission.

18:08.923 --> 18:12.308
And, um, sometimes I
wish I were allowed...

18:13.042 --> 18:14.183
You know what, I shouldn't say it.

18:14.208 --> 18:16.308
What? What? Say it.

18:16.784 --> 18:17.972
To talk in church.

18:17.997 --> 18:20.089
Yes, I know, I'm bad, I'm bad.

18:20.114 --> 18:21.654
You're so bad!

18:21.679 --> 18:23.412
What would you say?

18:23.738 --> 18:25.050
"Nice hat."

18:27.012 --> 18:28.534
I know.

18:29.347 --> 18:30.710
We should stop this.

18:30.778 --> 18:32.292
Al wouldn't like it.

18:32.317 --> 18:34.551
But we were just getting
to know each other.

18:34.576 --> 18:36.182
You're very nice.

18:36.217 --> 18:38.371
But you seem like trouble, and, um,

18:38.396 --> 18:41.003
I need to focus when
I make-a the pasta.

18:46.496 --> 18:48.194
Anyway, Al,

18:48.604 --> 18:50.348
uh...

18:50.934 --> 18:53.035
"I have band practice tomorrow."

18:53.060 --> 18:54.726
One guy said that to me.

18:55.136 --> 18:57.270
I... play...

18:57.338 --> 18:59.705
the... drums.

18:59.774 --> 19:02.262
Everybody knows that about me.

19:02.287 --> 19:06.332
I-I'm not saying I got to
be the drummer in every band,

19:06.357 --> 19:09.035
but how about an audition, at least?

19:10.189 --> 19:11.956
As a fellow musician, I have to say

19:11.981 --> 19:13.897
I find that to be quite rude.

19:13.922 --> 19:15.528
God, please don't let
the last thing I hear

19:15.553 --> 19:17.695
be you blabbering about your clarinet.

19:18.398 --> 19:19.795
Time's up, boys!

19:19.820 --> 19:21.187
What are your reasons?!

19:21.212 --> 19:23.696
Um, I-I'm, um, waiting for a package.

19:23.765 --> 19:26.465
And it's supposed to be delivered,
and I've missed it twice.

19:26.534 --> 19:28.110
Because my day's so busy.

19:28.135 --> 19:30.055
And-and-and if I miss it a third time,

19:30.080 --> 19:31.172
I'm gonna have to go
down to the post office,

19:31.197 --> 19:32.694
it's gonna be a whole thing.

19:32.719 --> 19:35.007
Wh-what's in the package?

19:37.199 --> 19:39.527
- Body wash.
- Nope!

19:39.552 --> 19:42.558
A package was almost an
acceptable reason, but...

19:42.583 --> 19:43.902
But there's other things!

19:43.927 --> 19:45.699
There's other things in that package,

19:45.724 --> 19:47.901
Dan... tell him the other
things that are in the package!

19:47.926 --> 19:49.105
Paper towels and socks!

19:49.130 --> 19:50.763
Let's just get this over with. Good-bye.

19:50.788 --> 19:53.025
No! No! No! The World Series is fixed!

19:53.050 --> 19:54.979
The Chicago White Sox
are gonna throw it.

19:55.004 --> 19:56.856
And we're making a big
bet... we can cut you in,

19:56.881 --> 19:58.542
and we could all make a lot of money!

20:15.444 --> 20:16.876
Was that the kiss of death?

20:16.901 --> 20:18.440
What is that?

20:19.284 --> 20:23.135
It's when you kiss someone
before you kill them.

20:23.160 --> 20:26.096
Kiss 'em and then kill 'em?

20:26.500 --> 20:28.588
That is sick.

20:29.364 --> 20:33.002
Boy, what a sick, cute
sweetie you turned out to be.

20:33.027 --> 20:35.194
Could we just have our bag back, please?

20:35.846 --> 20:37.065
Why don't we just wait and see

20:37.090 --> 20:40.987
how our little bet turns out
first, gentlemen, shall we?

20:45.229 --> 20:48.280
So we're stuck in 1919?

20:48.664 --> 20:51.684
You know, I feel like that all the time.
