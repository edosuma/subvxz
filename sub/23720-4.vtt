So, where's
the after party?

01:00.159 --> 01:01.693
This is the after party.

01:01.727 --> 01:04.596
Hands down,
the best breakfast
in town.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.666
Oh, man,
I could just keep going.

01:06.699 --> 01:08.501
Everybody in that
party was so in sync.

01:08.534 --> 01:10.369
-You don't even need words.
-Mm-hmm.

01:10.402 --> 01:11.671
That break dance crew,
who were they?

01:11.704 --> 01:13.573
You know it's 7:00 am, right?

01:13.606 --> 01:16.142
Yes, I know.

01:16.175 --> 01:18.411
It's just I haven't had
that much fun dancing
in a long time.

01:18.444 --> 01:21.647
Really? You didn't have fun
dancing up in High Water
with Sage Odom?

01:21.680 --> 01:23.716
No, it was fun.
It was fun.

01:23.749 --> 01:25.417
It was just stressful
because, you know, everybody

01:25.451 --> 01:26.886
-was judging me all the time.
-Mm.

01:26.919 --> 01:29.521
Even at my old school everything
had to be perfect, you know?

01:29.555 --> 01:31.224
I could never just
live in the moment.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.592
I was always thinking
about what's next.

01:33.659 --> 01:35.161
I never think
about what's next.

01:35.194 --> 01:37.163
-Never?
-Never.

01:37.196 --> 01:39.198
You have to be
planning your next party.

01:39.231 --> 01:41.800
-I guess it'll be tomorrow.
-You guess it'll be tomorrow?

01:41.834 --> 01:44.504
-You are so loud,
you know that?
-[both laughing]

01:44.537 --> 01:48.241
Can you look in the glove box
and give me some hot sauce?

01:48.274 --> 01:53.913
-Uh, what is all this?
-Thank you, last night's door.

01:53.946 --> 01:55.780
You don't want to put it
in the bank or something?

01:55.814 --> 01:57.350
Right now, it's burrito time,

01:57.383 --> 01:59.752
then sleep time,
then bank time.

02:01.921 --> 02:03.123
[both laughing]

02:09.961 --> 02:10.829
[items clattering]

02:10.863 --> 02:13.533
Oh, shit.

02:13.566 --> 02:15.234
Are you seriously
just getting in?1

02:15.267 --> 02:16.802
J, tell me you
weren't out all night.

02:16.835 --> 02:19.272
Shh. Okay, here comes
the curfew police.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.875
-And, you're drunk? Great.
-First of all, I am not drunk.

02:22.908 --> 02:26.212
I was drunk and high,
but now I'm just exhausted.

02:26.245 --> 02:28.214
-Wait, wait,
you're high?
-Shh.

02:28.247 --> 02:30.383
J, what the fuck is going on?
Suddenly you're the girl

02:30.416 --> 02:31.284
who runs out in the
middle of the night

02:31.317 --> 02:32.785
with a boy, with Dondre?

02:32.818 --> 02:35.321
Here we go again
with this Dondre drama, okay.

02:35.354 --> 02:36.589
I already told you
we're just friends,

02:36.622 --> 02:38.324
so can you please hold it down?

02:38.357 --> 02:39.559
I just-- I just need to sleep.

02:39.592 --> 02:41.761
Yeah, well not
that you care,

02:41.794 --> 02:43.462
but I covered for you again.

02:43.495 --> 02:45.465
Uncle Al already left for work.

02:46.732 --> 02:47.934
[sighing]

02:50.970 --> 02:53.239
Wait, our-- our boxes
from Ohio came?

02:53.272 --> 02:56.209
That's all your stuff.
I already unpacked my box.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.411
Yeah, one box.
Singular.

02:59.945 --> 03:01.614
[sighing]

03:21.367 --> 03:22.734
Oh, my God, I got in?

03:24.903 --> 03:26.506
I got in!

03:28.307 --> 03:29.909
New plan.

03:29.942 --> 03:32.612
Ohio State University
in the fall.

03:34.613 --> 03:36.449
-You got the cheer scholarship?
-Yep!

03:36.482 --> 03:37.917
[laughing]

03:37.950 --> 03:39.952
But, whoa this--
this is just a partial.

03:39.985 --> 03:41.120
How are you gonna come up
with the rest of the money?

03:41.153 --> 03:43.322
I don't know.
I'm gonna
figure it out, though.

03:43.355 --> 03:44.624
I thought you didn't
want to go to college.

03:44.657 --> 03:46.459
Well, I didn't
get into High Water,

03:46.492 --> 03:47.959
so what else am I gonna do?

03:47.993 --> 03:49.561
You know you'll have to
finish high school, so--

03:49.595 --> 03:51.330
Yeah, I'll get my GED.
Tal, hello?

03:51.363 --> 03:52.465
This is a good thing.

03:54.733 --> 03:56.669
Do you want to live
that far apart?

04:00.039 --> 04:01.840
Well, no, Tal.

04:01.874 --> 04:04.810
But, look, you have
a lot of good things

04:04.843 --> 04:06.646
going for you at
High Water, okay?

04:06.679 --> 04:08.814
Maybe even a shot
at Sage's tour.

04:08.847 --> 04:10.016
Yeah, right. I'm hanging
onto to High Water

04:10.049 --> 04:11.751
with tricks and screens.

04:11.784 --> 04:12.952
I can't dance like
the other guys,

04:12.985 --> 04:14.320
but sure,
I'll make the world tour.

04:14.353 --> 04:15.721
Yes, you can, okay?

04:15.754 --> 04:17.390
You can learn hip-hop,
I know it,

04:17.423 --> 04:18.491
and once you do that,
I know you'll get a shot

04:18.524 --> 04:19.858
on Sage's tour.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.394
You just can't let those
assholes intimidate you.

04:24.563 --> 04:26.699
[sighing]

04:32.771 --> 04:34.907
Yo, we need to
round out our crew

04:34.940 --> 04:37.977
with the best of
the new blood,
and she's it.

04:38.010 --> 04:40.746
Oh, fuck no, and why
do you get to decide?

04:40.779 --> 04:42.648
I'm not deciding,
I'm just stating facts.

04:42.681 --> 04:44.349
Look, we've all seen
how dope she is.

04:44.383 --> 04:45.950
[scoffs]
Whatever.

04:45.984 --> 04:48.054
-You gonna dance in that shit?
-I'm not staying.

04:48.087 --> 04:49.789
Sage hooked me up with
one of his producers,

04:49.822 --> 04:51.791
and I'm gonna work
on some new music.

04:51.824 --> 04:53.726
Hell yeah, man.
That's the kind of
one-up that we need.

04:53.759 --> 04:55.461
So when we getting
in the studio?

04:55.494 --> 04:57.997
Ah, he didn't say anything
about bringing anyone else,

04:58.030 --> 05:00.066
so I just don't want to
piss him off, you know?

05:00.099 --> 05:01.700
Nah, man, I get it.
It's all good.

05:01.734 --> 05:04.337
Aight, cool. But, hey,
come by later, though.

05:04.370 --> 05:05.538
Yeah, I'll see
what I can do.

05:05.571 --> 05:06.739
And try not to fuck it up.

05:17.549 --> 05:18.784
-Hey.
-What?

05:20.853 --> 05:23.022
-I'm Tal, by the way.
-I know who you are.

05:23.055 --> 05:25.725
What do you want?
You need something?

05:25.758 --> 05:28.394
Yeah, yeah.
Um, I need your help.

05:28.427 --> 05:29.628
You're like--
You're arguably, like,

05:29.661 --> 05:31.097
the best dancer
in the whole school.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.466
Yeah, well, that's something
that we already know.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.735
Right, and I'm the only one
who can't dance hip-hop.

05:35.768 --> 05:38.470
Dance hip-hop?
Okay, I can't.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.440
Look, whatever it is,
I just need some help.

05:41.473 --> 05:43.642
Look, you need help,
but not with your moves.

05:43.675 --> 05:46.679
I saw that crazy-ass audition,
that crazy-ass greyhound thing.

05:46.712 --> 05:48.546
It's all dope,
so why you playing?

05:48.580 --> 05:50.616
How about you hit up my
Insta if want some of my moves.

05:50.649 --> 05:54.120
Look, I'm not dope,
and I don't have Instagram.

05:54.153 --> 05:57.089
Boy, bye. If you gonna be
in this school,
you need to stay current.

05:57.122 --> 05:59.492
Instagram, Twitter,
it's all part of the game.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.060
Sage sees that,
and is gonna for sure

06:01.093 --> 06:02.695
take that into account
when he's doing the tour.

06:02.728 --> 06:04.563
Yeah, but social media
gives me hives.

06:04.596 --> 06:06.065
-I just don't see the point.
-Okay, I can't do this.

06:06.098 --> 06:09.135
Either you in or you ain't,
and clearly you ain't,

06:09.168 --> 06:10.870
so you can go back to
being in the '90s now.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.942
Hey, where's
your boy, Davis?

06:16.975 --> 06:20.079
I don't know.
Haven't seen him
since yesterday.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.422
But no, you killed at
that show at the Public.

06:29.455 --> 06:31.824
You know, I remember your
audition for it, as well.

06:31.857 --> 06:33.692
You did a pretty
good job yourself.

06:33.725 --> 06:34.894
Well, thank you,
thank you.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.630
Too bad nobody believed
I was 18, though.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.598
The consolation prize
wasn't that bad

06:39.631 --> 06:40.900
because you took me
to dinner.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.602
Uh, I think
you followed me
to Papaya King,

06:43.635 --> 06:45.704
ate your hot dog,
ate my hot dog.

06:45.737 --> 06:47.773
-Maybe you had been
Snoop Dogging a little bit.
-Shh, shh.

06:47.806 --> 06:50.042
Good morning, guys.
Good morning.

06:50.075 --> 06:53.878
Okay, okay. I am so excited
because I have been trying

06:53.912 --> 06:56.882
to get this man here
for a year to teach you

06:56.915 --> 06:59.051
the thing that he does
better than anyone

06:59.084 --> 07:01.987
in the entire world.
So please, please make it

07:02.020 --> 07:05.591
worth his time, and give
it up for the legendary
Quincy Hobbs.

07:06.658 --> 07:09.094
Thank you for that.

07:09.127 --> 07:11.464
Thank you.
Good to see you all.

07:16.134 --> 07:18.504
I want you
to find your sizes.

07:21.740 --> 07:25.011
[taps clattering]

07:31.049 --> 07:35.854
So, uh, I would like to
continue just talking to you

07:35.888 --> 07:38.157
about, you know, some of
the history of the dance.

07:38.190 --> 07:42.594
As far as I'm concerned,
this style of dancing...

07:42.628 --> 07:45.598
when you're communicating,
it comes from a native place,
all right?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.032
So, let's start with the
rudiments that we were doing.

07:47.065 --> 07:48.901
One, two, ready, hey.

07:48.934 --> 07:51.904
[taps clattering]

07:56.241 --> 07:58.711
I would like to
congratulate you all

07:58.744 --> 08:01.680
on your exciting
journey of finishing

08:01.713 --> 08:03.816
your high school education.

08:03.849 --> 08:07.786
Now, who would like to
introduce themselves?

08:07.819 --> 08:09.221
Hey, y'all,
I'm Rachel.

08:09.254 --> 08:11.757
I'm a dancer, but I'm
thinking after this GED,

08:11.790 --> 08:13.959
maybe being a
forensic attorney.

08:13.992 --> 08:15.528
I love all that
Forensic Files shit.

08:15.561 --> 08:17.229
Hey, I'm a dancer, too.

08:17.262 --> 08:18.564
Really, where do you work?

08:18.597 --> 08:19.732
Oh, more like an
aspiring dancer.

08:19.765 --> 08:21.099
Gotcha, I'm at Velvet City.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.203
Oh, you're a stripper?

08:24.236 --> 08:27.006
Oh, I thought you meant
a real dancer.

08:27.039 --> 08:29.875
[scoffs]
For your information, hon,
in Atlanta,

08:29.908 --> 08:31.710
the best dancers
are in strip clubs,

08:31.743 --> 08:35.080
and the best of the best
strip Velvet fucking City.

08:35.113 --> 08:36.081
If you've got a problem
with that, then--

08:36.114 --> 08:37.950
[teacher clearing throat]

08:37.982 --> 08:41.785
You have something
more important to say?

08:41.820 --> 08:43.956
-Hmm?
-Nope.

08:50.762 --> 08:52.964
[taps clattering]

08:59.838 --> 09:01.107
[Quincy] Yeah.

09:04.309 --> 09:07.813
Keep these famous, uh,
contributors in mind also.

09:07.846 --> 09:10.015
Cats like Gregory Hines,
the Nicholas Brothers,

09:10.048 --> 09:12.251
um, and everything they
had to go through

09:12.284 --> 09:17.089
in order to get this dance
to a place of recognition,

09:17.122 --> 09:18.723
you know what I mean?

09:18.757 --> 09:20.825
[taps clattering]

09:20.859 --> 09:23.596
An expression,
like, how do you feel?

09:23.629 --> 09:25.798
Uh, I feel-- I feel good.

09:25.831 --> 09:27.032
-You feel good?
-Yeah.

09:27.065 --> 09:28.734
All right, let me hear how
&quot;I feel good&quot;

09:28.767 --> 09:31.003
sounds through the dance.

09:33.672 --> 09:35.140
Now, you gotta have
the conversation.

09:35.173 --> 09:38.210
[taps clattering]

09:38.243 --> 09:40.212
Yeah, you do your own thing.
You don't do my thing.

09:40.245 --> 09:41.947
You express yourself,
you know what I mean?

09:41.980 --> 09:44.717
We're gonna do
a little trade.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.252
Yeah, so this was something
that the cats were doing,

09:47.285 --> 09:49.655
and when I mention the cats,
I'm talking about some

09:49.688 --> 09:52.223
very important men
and women of the dance.

09:52.257 --> 09:54.325
Yeah, they would challenge
each other to be better.

09:54.359 --> 09:55.895
[taps clattering]

09:58.196 --> 09:59.665
Unh, unh, hey, oh, hey.

10:02.334 --> 10:04.203
And how about you?
You all right?

10:04.236 --> 10:06.170
I see you got the
personality thing
going on,

10:06.204 --> 10:09.375
but I need you to, you know,
execute the steps, yes?

10:09.408 --> 10:12.144
-Yeah.
-Yeah, okay, maybe.

10:12.177 --> 10:13.212
Let me see.

10:13.245 --> 10:14.313
[taps clattering]

10:17.215 --> 10:18.751
If you're not
speaking to the dance,

10:18.784 --> 10:20.920
you ain't saying nothing.

10:25.924 --> 10:27.192
And how about you?
You all right?

10:27.225 --> 10:29.828
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-All right, are you sure?

10:29.861 --> 10:31.764
Uh, let's go over
a little bit
of the routine

10:31.797 --> 10:33.298
that we were doing
earlier, yeah?

10:33.331 --> 10:34.934
Here we go.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.839
Don't forget
about the music!

10:47.879 --> 10:49.715
[Tal] Hey J, everything okay?

10:49.748 --> 10:52.217
Tal, I'm stressing.
I called OSU,

10:52.250 --> 10:54.920
and now that I'm out of state,
it's fucking expensive.

10:54.953 --> 10:56.055
It's 11 grand for housing alone.

10:57.289 --> 11:00.059
Hey, look, no worries.
After what?

11:00.092 --> 11:02.361

you'll be all set.

Tal, come on, I already
told you I'm stressing.

11:05.330 --> 11:07.433
You know me. I need to
have something to focus on.

11:07.466 --> 11:09.301
I have to get to college.

11:09.334 --> 11:11.369
All right, all right,
all right. I'm sorry,

11:11.403 --> 11:14.973
but you have some time to figure
this out, okay, you do.

And listen, if there's one thing
I know about you is
you can make miracles happen.

All right?
Look, I got to go.

11:21.346 --> 11:23.749
I got to get to class,
but we can talk later, yeah?

11:25.016 --> 11:27.086
Okay, all right, fine.
I'll see you at home.

mean to judge you earlier.

you can make from last night,

out here.

maybe even get my dad
out the streets.

get back in, huh?

Business is business,
and I runs mine.

withhold on the payment

21:16.874 --> 21:18.010
'til the shit is done.

21:19.811 --> 21:21.413
I can do that?

21:21.446 --> 21:23.648
If you look at the costs,

21:23.681 --> 21:26.518
I got a guy
that can handle it.

21:26.551 --> 21:28.852
How much will that save?

you leave.

-I come and go as I please.

was reckless and stupid,

reckless and stupid
is what gets you going.

put together are no joke.

This the big leagues.
