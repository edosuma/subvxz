00:33.804 --> 00:35.804
Ok, guys.
All right, talent is moving. Here we go.

00:42.816 --> 00:44.016
How you doing man?

00:45.535 --> 00:47.920
You feel good?

00:49.244 --> 00:52.244
A little nervous.

00:54.796 --> 00:55.996
Aw, come on. Come on.

00:56.907 --> 00:58.997
Here's the brush.
Just a little bit. Ok.

00:58.998 --> 01:00.998
All right guys. Love you.

01:01.567 --> 01:02.999
All right. take it easy. Packed.

01:04.061 --> 01:06.061
Is it?
Yeah.

01:08.388 --> 01:09.588
Don't worry. You're gonna be great. You're gonna be great.

01:10.595 --> 01:11.795
Oh, my God.

01:13.951 --> 01:15.951
Here we go.

01:50.407 --> 01:51.607
Let's do it.

05:14.228 --> 05:17.652
To say I know JD McQueen is both an understatement and an overstatement.

05:18.312 --> 05:22.703
I know everything about him. Born december 7. Favorite color red.

05:23.338 --> 05:26.359
youngest solo artist to have sixtten top forty hits.

05:27.097 --> 05:28.888
I could go on and on.

05:31.744 --> 05:34.456
But I don't actually know him.
I've never even seen him.

05:35.083 --> 05:37.969
To me, he's a poster, an autograph, a CD.

05:38.600 --> 05:43.313
It's like he's not a real person cause he's too...perfect.

05:44.394 --> 05:46.051
Real people have real problems.

05:51.694 --> 05:53.966
My biggest problem is smart kids aren't cool.

05:54.433 --> 05:55.767
It's a universal truth.

05:57.535 --> 05:59.400
They're the geeks of the high school class system.

06:34.361 --> 06:38.405
What' up, London?
Arigato,Tokyo!

06:38.867 --> 06:43.883
Frankfurt, let me hear you scream as loud as you can!

06:50.170 --> 06:52.748
Honney, lose the gum.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.453
Hey, J.D.?
Wake up, man.

07:09.454 --> 07:12.845
Oh, what's up?
The tour is done.

07:12.846 --> 07:15.608
The album's a hit.
The single's top ten.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.609
That should make the record company happy, right?

07:18.610 --> 07:19.910
We're home.

07:24.706 --> 07:26.547
But this is where I spend most of my time.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.565
And this is where I work.

07:33.316 --> 07:36.577
The  Commence.
Hey, Harv.

07:36.578 --> 07:39.400
Hey  Henrietta.
Hi, kiddo. What's the good word?

07:39.401 --> 07:42.852
Uh, school, I guess.

07:43.924 --> 07:46.790
Huh. School. Ha ha ha.
When I was your age that would've been the last thing I said.

07:46.791 --> 07:48.091
That's for sure.

07:52.654 --> 07:54.527
And this is my best friend Abby.

07:54.993 --> 07:57.042
What's up, Jane?
She sees the good in everything.

07:57.043 --> 08:01.371
So, how's the "Abby wants a car fund"?

08:01.372 --> 08:04.425
Not too good. What'd your parents say?

08:04.426 --> 08:08.955
My dad says that if I can get a car he'll pay for the insurance which means that I need to find a car for $ 411,77.

08:16.286 --> 08:19.582
You hear that some super freak got a perfect score on their S.A.T?

08:23.461 --> 08:26.320
Yeah. What a geek.
Probably some total loser with no life.

08:28.742 --> 08:31.958
Sounds pretty accurate.
You're not a loser and you have a life.

08:33.238 --> 08:36.558
I know-- a boring one.

08:48.808 --> 08:50.008
Yo, Joe Cool, we need to talk

08:50.875 --> 08:52.109
Now.

08:53.175 --> 08:57.911
Timmy, go do your homework.
You have no idea how much that school for gifted geeks sucks.

08:57.912 --> 09:02.767
Homework, now.
J.D,tell her to let me go to a regular school.

09:06.117 --> 09:10.811
Speaking of regular school I've decided to revoke your privilege of being home schooled for one teeny, tiny reason.
You're failing.

09:11.411 --> 09:12.812
So what? I'm a pop star!!

09:14.394 --> 09:17.154
No more special treatment.

09:17.155 --> 09:22.920
You are gonna be a normal kid at a normal high school.

09:22.921 --> 09:25.799
You can't send me to a public school, mom! I'm a celebrity!

09:25.800 --> 09:30.042
Ooh! Wll, it's done... and if you don't pass, it means summer school.

09:30.043 --> 09:32.562
And that means no summer tour.

09:33.732 --> 09:36.285
No. No way. I'm just gonna go live with Dad in New York.

09:36.286 --> 09:39.134
Oh, really? Well, for once he and I actually agree on something.

09:39.999 --> 09:43.960
Look, we're both worried  about how things could turn out for you, Joey.

09:44.379 --> 09:48.986
You guys are watching way too much "Behind the music."
Oh, you don't even want to know how bad it can get.

09:48.987 --> 09:52.786
Grant, what are you doing here?
Well, your mom called and asked me to stop by.

09:52.787 --> 09:57.290
Will you tell her not to do this to me, please?
Hey, I'm your manager, not your parent.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.460
Besides, I think she's doing the right thing.
Think about your fans.

10:01.262 --> 10:05.237
You're a role model to thousands of kids.

10:05.238 --> 10:09.268
Yeah, and for once, try to think about your future.
Think about the great publicity.

10:16.319 --> 10:19.756
How you expect to write a whole novel if you can't finish page one?

10:20.394 --> 10:23.200
I wonder if Jane Austen had this much trouble.

10:23.850 --> 10:28.020
Write about yourself.
Who would want to read about me?

10:29.465 --> 10:33.691
Who would want to be me?
Well, then write a scary story.

10:34.199 --> 10:37.692
You're still afraid of the dark.
I'm not.
Are, too.

10:37.693 --> 10:41.725
Besides, I like romantic stories.
Well, you've never even had a boyfriend.

10:42.171 --> 10:47.788
I'm waiting for the perfect match.
I am so tired of that perfect match stuff.

10:48.321 --> 10:54.108
A relationship with anyone other than your perfect match is bound to end in heartche. I mean, look at my sister.

10:54.508 --> 10:57.213
Ever since Tommy broke up with her she hasn't come out of her room.

10:57.214 --> 11:01.731
She was stood up at the altar on her wedding day in front of everybody she knows.

11:02.805 --> 11:09.315
She should've waited for her perfect match.

11:09.316 --> 11:13.606
Mr. Perfect could walt through that door right now and you'd start quizzing him on the Pythagorean theorem or whatever.

11:17.454 --> 11:19.454
Jane,you need to lighten up.

11:26.571 --> 11:28.571
I think he's cute.

11:41.204 --> 11:44.437
Well, oops, I guess.
Haha! Brain freak.

12:59.236 --> 13:01.529
Whatever! Come on.
Ha Ha! Oh, my God. Oh.

13:17.271 --> 13:18.471
Welcome to calculus, Mr. McQueen.

13:58.242 --> 13:59.834
This is a testing  so please choose a seat, and you can study quietly.

14:01.286 --> 14:03.873
Are you all right?
No. I just hate tests.

14:14.769 --> 14:18.221
All right, pencils down. Please leave your tests face down on your desks as you leave.
Kevin, would you see me after class?

14:26.452 --> 14:29.145
You know my rule-- cheaters don't get second chances.
J.D, will you relax?

14:42.592 --> 14:45.707
You just need some help with your school work.
Come on.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.888
You don't understand. I've had tutors. They don't help me.

14:50.434 --> 14:53.489
No,no, no. I'm not talking about a tutor -- like, an assistant.

14:54.131 --> 14:57.389
Find the smartest girl in school and ask her to help you out.

14:58.193 --> 15:00.956
You're saying I should hook up with a smart girl and cheat off her?

15:01.981 --> 15:05.702
No, I'm saying it takes someone in high school to help you with high school.

15:06.648 --> 15:11.049
Now, I gotta go and meet this new genius at the record label and you gotta get back to school, all right?

15:11.623 --> 15:13.967
All right, man. I'll catch you later.
All right, man.

15:25.887 --> 15:27.087
Do your job.
Take care.
See you.

15:32.188 --> 15:34.461
He's even cuter in person.
I hope he doesn't run for student body president.

15:38.291 --> 15:39.491
Pop rock wuss.

15:43.463 --> 15:44.663
Oh, he's totally dateble.

15:50.016 --> 15:52.035
If he hits on my girlfriend, she'll dump me.

16:09.277 --> 16:11.588
I have finally found what I've been looking for.

16:11.589 --> 16:16.872
Oh my God. That is exactly hat my dad said when he met his fouth wife.

16:16.873 --> 16:19.311
I'm talking about me and J.D. McQueen.

16:20.611 --> 16:23.645
Now, that would be a tight fit.
Whitney, you may rule in this school,

16:23.646 --> 16:28.403
but J.D...
Being with J.D. will make me legendary, beyond this stupied little high school.

16:28.404 --> 16:33.403
I guarantee it.
Hi, Bobett. Uh, you want to go yo prom?

16:35.275 --> 16:36.475
With me?
Ha ha ha ha!

16:38.398 --> 16:43.261
Ok, I now that must've taken a lot of guts given that I'm one of prettiest girls in school

16:43.262 --> 16:50.109
and you're... wll, you.
ASo, uh, let me think about it, ok?

16:50.110 --> 16:51.310
Ok, yeah.

16:52.689 --> 16:55.529
Ok, so I just thought about ir, and, yeah, no. Ew.

16:59.836 --> 17:02.882
Why do you have to be so nice to everyone?
I'm not.

17:05.624 --> 17:09.819
Judge not those who try and fail but those that fail to try.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.794
Is that J.D. McQueen?
Oh, it's him.Does that kid go to our high school?
I can't believe he's here.

17:30.882 --> 17:33.610
Talk to him!
He's so sexy.

17:42.488 --> 17:44.402
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Do it.

17:47.708 --> 17:49.882
How do I look?
You are so hot. Oh, my God. I'm so glad you're my friend.

17:49.883 --> 17:52.375
Wish me luck.

18:10.315 --> 18:13.890
Hi  J.D.
My name is  Whitney Alison.

18:20.431 --> 18:21.731
Know what double-A stands for?

18:24.303 --> 18:28.364
Small battery?
Heh Heh. No. It means you can call me anytime, anywhere.

18:29.260 --> 18:31.532
Oricand si oriunde.

19:00.174 --> 19:01.374
Hey, where'd my soda go?

19:09.835 --> 19:11.135
Did I eat already? What--

19:16.615 --> 19:17.915
You should talk to him.

19:18.897 --> 19:21.355
He doesn't want to talk to me.

19:21.356 --> 19:23.701
You're right, and you'd better stay away from him because he's mine.

19:23.702 --> 19:27.432
Whitney, shouldn't you be in some teacher's office begging for a passing grade?

19:27.921 --> 19:33.056
Well, I wouldn't have to if it wasn't for Miss Brain Freak.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.998
Dar ea mi-a stricat tot planul.
Ai vrut sa copiezi tot de la mine.

19:36.999 --> 19:42.853
My 68 would be a "C" instead of a "D" but she ruined the curve.

19:44.568 --> 19:47.511
A grading curve ensures fairness. If your 68 had been the highest grade  it would've been an "A".
Well, if everyone would cooperate  and get a 68, then we'd all get "A"s.

19:48.207 --> 19:54.568
So, if everyone got a "D", everyone would get an "A"?

19:54.569 --> 19:55.869
That' not a curve.

20:05.287 --> 20:09.955
Brain freak, you woul not know a curve  if you had two rolls of toilet paper and a water bra.
Brace face.

20:10.813 --> 20:12.895
Excuse me, sir. Could you help me for a second?
They gave me a key to my locker but I can't find it. Being a pop star it's kind of hard to keep track of this kind os stuff.

20:12.896 --> 20:14.096
It's that one.

20:20.664 --> 20:24.186
This is your locker?
Heh. I'm a huge fan of me.

20:26.079 --> 20:28.364
To whom much is given, much is expected.

20:54.334 --> 20:55.534
Want to quench your thist?
Be like J.D. McQueen. Drink Crystal Geyser.
He's so cute.

21:04.377 --> 21:08.151
I'm starting a lemonade stand.
Mmm. Tanks.

21:12.903 --> 21:17.079
That'll be $1,00.
Uh, let me give you a tip. Get the money first.

21:17.909 --> 21:22.468
I'll get it. maybe it's someone who's thirsty.

21:29.642 --> 21:31.387
Hey, cutie. Got a date for the prom?

21:35.544 --> 21:36.747
Oh, I hate when that happens.

21:43.534 --> 21:46.650
She fainted. Don't worry. Happens all the time.

21:48.787 --> 21:51.220
We should keep her feet elevated. That'd probably be best.

21:56.469 --> 21:59.631
Uh..uh... My-- my name is--is--is--

22:00.125 --> 22:01.695
Take your time. It'll come to you.

22:04.887 --> 22:10.566
Oh, um, I found this at school and it had your address in it  so I thought I'd bring it back to you.

22:11.140 --> 22:13.951
Where was it?
Um, it was over by the lockers.

22:24.295 --> 22:30.052
I like this room. It looks just like mine, but, uh... it doesn't have all the pictures of me on the wall.

22:31.965 --> 22:34.714
I like it. It's nice.
It's cool-- my kind of room.

22:41.836 --> 22:45.136
You ok?

22:45.137 --> 22:46.537
Hey, slleping princess, are you awake?

22:54.836 --> 23:00.665
Definitely my kind of room.
My-my dad and my psycho step-mom are due back soon.

23:02.902 --> 23:06.467
Is that her?
Oh, that's my real mom.

23:07.828 --> 23:10.426
Oh. Divorce?
Mine, too.

23:13.749 --> 23:17.850
Does Abby want to stay for dinner?
Hey, that is weird. I thought I paid that.

23:18.552 --> 23:19.851
We're gonna have pizza and...

23:27.011 --> 23:29.414
Holy cow.
Pizza and holy cow? Sounds yummy.

23:30.942 --> 23:32.242
Mmm, that  smells good.

23:34.322 --> 23:35.522
Oh, hey, honey.

23:37.156 --> 23:40.922
Wow. I thought tonight was pizza night.

23:44.001 --> 23:47.487
Jane has a boy over for dinner -- J.D. McQueen.

23:48.822 --> 23:52.233
J.D McQeen?
Sounds sketchy.

23:53.638 --> 23:57.703
So, Shady, tell me a little about yourself.
Actually, it's, uh, J.D.

23:58.317 --> 24:02.261
Um, that's "J" period "D" period.
Oh, I see.

24:03.110 --> 24:07.329
Well, not "I" period "C" period, but I see... period.

24:08.508 --> 24:11.431
What does J.D. stand for?
I don't like my real name.

24:13.186 --> 24:19.656
J.B., have you made your plans for college yet?
Sunshine here got a perfect score on her S.A.T.'s a lot of early acceptances--

24:19.657 --> 24:22.242
Stanford, Harvard, Yale, U.C Berkley.
Um, no, actually, I haven't seen it.

24:23.142 --> 24:29.501
I meant "U" period "C" period Berkeley.

24:30.212 --> 24:31.502
Jane here got a full scholarship.

24:35.353 --> 24:37.653
I'm not sure college is for me. I'm gonna be working, so--

24:38.688 --> 24:43.338
Ah, money's a little tight, huh, son?

24:43.339 --> 24:46.339
Well, if you want to make your mark on this world you must get a college degree.

24:46.340 --> 24:52.567
Heh. Dad's just saying that because he's been teaching at "S" period "C" cperiod "U" period for a very long period.

24:53.069 --> 24:55.765
Mari Havercorn got her period.

24:57.657 --> 24:59.657
So, can I call you?
Sure.

24:59.658 --> 25:05.514
I'm at my dad's on Thursdays and Fridays and alternating weekends and Wednesdays, and I'm at my mom's...

25:05.515 --> 25:07.198
Here, take this.

25:09.439 --> 25:11.439
Now we're connected.

25:12.972 --> 25:14.172
Jane?

25:16.326 --> 25:17.890
Hell?Jane?

25:21.294 --> 25:23.362
Don't stay up too late tonight, all right?

25:23.931 --> 25:27.215
I know.
I know you know.

25:27.216 --> 25:30.620
I just... want to remind you.

25:32.103 --> 25:33.884
What are you working on?

25:34.723 --> 25:37.141
Can I help?
I don't need your help.

25:38.183 --> 25:39.801
You don't need my help. Ok.

25:41.359 --> 25:43.711
You know, just once, I wish that you did.

25:46.788 --> 25:48.788
Good night.

26:11.612 --> 26:16.379
Ah,Sunshine. You know  I've never interfered in your love life.

26:17.578 --> 26:20.700
I've never had a love life.
Yes, but you're going places.

26:20.701 --> 26:24.860
This kid, he's headed nowhere.
He's only the hottest pop star.

26:25.253 --> 26:29.146
Oh, I'm sure he's made tons of money playing in all the finest garages over the city.

26:30.156 --> 26:35.817
Between song royalties, product endorsements, and concert revenues, he makes over $10 milion a year.

26:36.246 --> 26:39.803
In the words of your generation, "Yeah, right."

26:43.777 --> 26:45.370
"I wish my boobs were bigger"?
No, no,no.

26:45.371 --> 26:46.934
Not that one. The other one.

26:50.690 --> 26:57.189
"J.D McQueen adds Australia to summer world tour."

27:00.364 --> 27:01.664
"J" period "D" period?

27:08.076 --> 27:11.946
Did I ever tell you I hate walking to school?
It's better than the idiots on the bus.

27:15.955 --> 27:20.104
Don't enter a wet T-shirt contest. You'll never win.
Guys!

27:21.688 --> 27:22.888
Geeks!

27:26.864 --> 27:29.635
I really hate walking to school.

27:30.418 --> 27:31.636
Now what?

27:34.358 --> 27:38.093
Hey, you girls want a ride?
My name is--is--

27:38.749 --> 27:40.330
Take your time. It'll come to you.

27:40.772 --> 27:42.031
Let's go.

27:49.414 --> 27:51.761
Jane. did I leave my shades at your house?
Cause I can't find them.

28:02.272 --> 28:04.920
Is it OK if I walk you to class? I don't want to piss your boyfriend off.

28:05.483 --> 28:07.546
I don't have a boyfriend.
I was just checking.

28:08.599 --> 28:11.605
You want to hook up Saturday?
I need to study.

28:12.193 --> 28:14.286
I'll tell you what. All the good cartoons are over by 11:00.

28:14.287 --> 28:18.504
At noon I'll pick you up, we'll get some lunch and after that, we'll crack a book together.

28:18.505 --> 28:21.272
What you say?
Whay me?

28:22.341 --> 28:24.689
Because I think you're special.
After you.

28:27.595 --> 28:31.226
It doesn't make any sense. Why me?
Jane, he thinks you're special.

28:31.674 --> 28:34.995
Hello? Go for it.
Yeah, but J.D. could have any girl he wants.

28:35.691 --> 28:36.896
Go for it.

28:43.746 --> 28:45.828
A four- leaf clover.
It's a sign, Jane.

28:45.829 --> 28:48.150
It means something wonderful is right in front of you.
Kick it! Over here! Got it!
Pass the ball!

29:02.912 --> 29:07.436
Your dad gave me three great girls so I say he was a perfect match.

29:09.166 --> 29:11.071
Was it psycho Diane?

29:13.071 --> 29:15.935
It wasn't Diane. And wasn't your father.

29:17.198 --> 29:19.866
It was me. I thought you both knew that.

29:21.465 --> 29:22.865
Oh, Chrismas day?

29:24.274 --> 29:31.914
Yep. Your dad said, "Honey, the turkey seems a bit dry this year."

29:33.331 --> 29:36.920
Well, he had a point.
Thank you, Heh.

29:39.778 --> 29:43.798
Anyway, I, uh... I went crazy.

29:44.677 --> 29:45.999
I remember.

29:47.905 --> 29:55.675
It's just..I had these fantasies about what my life was supposed tobe like.

29:56.813 --> 30:02.515
And when my destiny and my fantasy turned out to be two different things,

30:03.863 --> 30:08.134
it was easy to blame your father.
I'm afraid of making a mistake and messing up my destiny.

30:08.578 --> 30:11.351
The definition od destiny prevents that from happening.

30:11.771 --> 30:17.083
What about a twist of fate?
Like when you miss a bus, and it changes your whole life.

30:17.422 --> 30:21.205
Fate loves the fearless.
What's that supposed to mean?

30:21.206 --> 30:25.054
You have to be out there trying to catch the bus in the first place.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.607
Do you have a special place?
My earlobes.

30:31.099 --> 30:33.339
A girl nibbles on them, and it's, like, wow.

30:33.340 --> 30:37.600
No! A special place, like Mount Olympus.

30:37.601 --> 30:42.900
Mount what?
Greek mythology.

30:44.733 --> 30:51.265
Mount Olympus is where Zeus, the king of gods held court.
This is my special place. I come here to study, write, dream.

30:51.266 --> 30:54.768
What do you dream about?
Stupid stuff.

30:54.769 --> 30:56.269
I highly doubt that.

30:57.637 --> 31:00.349
But this-- this is stupid stuff.

31:00.805 --> 31:07.443
O mean, have you ever heard anybody say "If I could find the derivative of 2x-squared plus 5 I could make my house payments?"

31:07.444 --> 31:10.778
I love math.
Everyting is right or wrong.

31:11.584 --> 31:14.295
It's black or white.
It's precise, pure. It's perfect.

31:15.684 --> 31:19.441
All right. I'm fired up. Let's do some cool math stuff. You ready?

31:20.256 --> 31:23.758
Now, so think of a fuction as a box.

31:23.759 --> 31:27.379
You plug in different values for "X" and you get different values for "Y".

31:27.725 --> 31:31.080
Oh. So, then you graph the "X" and then "Y" axis.

31:31.081 --> 31:36.637
Exactly.
So, on problem number twelve as "X" increases,"Y"...

31:36.638 --> 31:38.462
Decreases.
Good. Ha ha.

31:40.695 --> 31:43.787
All right, um, let's do problem number four.
Ok, let's try four.

32:08.012 --> 32:10.012
I got it!
Hold on one seceond.

32:12.225 --> 32:14.993
All right, let me see this.
They're a perfect match.

32:32.364 --> 32:36.228
Oh, this is a beautiful car.
And it's your favorite color.

32:37.464 --> 32:38.764
How'd you know that?

32:39.378 --> 32:40.765
I know a lot about you.

32:41.950 --> 32:46.758
Wanna drive it?
Oh, I'm not a very good driver.

32:46.759 --> 32:52.533
I hit a deer last Deember, and I haven't driven since.
That's not your fault.

32:54.081 --> 32:56.539
They jump in front of cars all the time.
Not when they're attached to Santa Claus and sevem plastic reindeer.

32:57.080 --> 33:00.514
You had an accident. Practice makes perfect.
I've never driven a Porsche before.

33:02.049 --> 33:03.249
It's time to learn.

33:10.265 --> 33:12.559
OK.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.925
I don't know what I'm doing. I've never done this before.
Driving's like a math equation. There's a formula to it.

33:16.764 --> 33:18.746
All right, step on the brake. Start it up.

33:22.326 --> 33:23.570
Put it in drive. Let's go.

33:27.213 --> 33:29.293
Oh, no. I broke your car.
No, you haven't. Press the brake.

33:29.294 --> 33:31.256
I'll put it in gear for you.

33:34.472 --> 33:35.772
Hit it.

33:39.300 --> 34:37.425
Wow, this is so much better than math.

35:31.628 --> 35:34.577
Cool. It's my first text message.

35:35.169 --> 35:39.957
"What's your favorite color?"
Red. Heh.

35:54.622 --> 35:55.765
"Good night,Jane."

35:59.116 --> 36:03.493
"Sleep...tight... J.D."

36:07.617 --> 36:12.519
Why did I write "Sleep tight?"
That's just stupid. what does that mean?

36:13.589 --> 36:18.244
He must-- he must think I'm an idiot.
Who knew text messaging would be so stressful?

36:26.278 --> 36:27.478
Hey, Abby. What?
Heh.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.446
"Jane, I tought this would look good on you. J.D."

36:41.524 --> 36:47.137
He bought me a car?
He's J.D. McQueen. To him, buying a car is like buying a pair of sneakers.

36:48.505 --> 36:51.465
He bought me a car?
Not  just any car. a Porsche.
Come on!

36:56.441 --> 36:59.543
Hey, Jane. Nice car.

36:59.544 --> 37:02.544
Hi, Jane.
Hey, Jane. Nice car.

37:02.545 --> 37:05.067
Did I ever tell you-- I love driving to school.

37:26.973 --> 37:29.986
J.D, is this for real?
Unless you want a different color.

37:29.987 --> 37:33.892
I don't understand. Why?
You needed a car. I wanted to help you out.

37:33.892 --> 37:50.055
Maybe someday you could help me out, too.

37:33.893 --> 37:38.031
I gotta go to work.
All right. Me too. I'll see you later. Bye.

37:45.629 --> 37:49.156
Hey, come on.

37:52.784 --> 37:57.291
Let's do this.

38:00.186 --> 38:01.386
OK.

38:04.373 --> 38:06.439
Hello. What's your name?

38:06.993 --> 38:08.240
Anna.

38:19.497 --> 38:21.497
Hey.

38:24.082 --> 38:27.874
I called your insurance agent and told him about my new car.
Um, dad, you remember you said if I got a car you'd pay for my insurance?

38:39.805 --> 38:41.804
Oh, good. You remember.

38:58.497 --> 39:00.497
Ok, come right here.

39:39.838 --> 39:41.038
Whoo!!

39:49.061 --> 39:50.261
Are you ok?

39:55.262 --> 39:56.462
Hi,Jane.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.220
What's up,Jane?

40:01.925 --> 40:03.125
What's going on, Jane?

40:11.413 --> 40:13.980
Do you remember me?
Hey, Jane.

40:26.941 --> 40:30.700
She still has braces.She's still a geek.
Say, was that your high school helper I saw today at the autograph thing?

40:31.607 --> 40:35.178
Heh heh. Yeah. Her name is Jane Brighton.
She showed me her special place.

40:35.437 --> 40:38.842
Behind the earlobes?
She call it her Mount Olympus.

40:39.468 --> 40:42.060
I've never heard it called that before.
It's a park bench down by the beach.

40:43.180 --> 40:46.242
We go there. We just hang out.

40:47.001 --> 40:50.645
We talk. We do math.
Great, see?

40:51.202 --> 40:53.615
I told you this high school thing was gonna be a breeze.

40:54.146 --> 40:59.338
Not exactly, Grant.
I have a math test tomorrow. Tere's just something I hate about taking tests.
Yeah, the questions.

42:00.621 --> 42:02.287
What happened? Are you sick?

42:02.288 --> 42:05.606
I've been puking all morning. Hey, how was the test? Was it hard?

42:06.138 --> 42:09.034
Um, nah, we just had to graph a non-linear function-- "S" times cosine "Y".

42:09.035 --> 42:13.407
Did you use the mean value theorem to solve that one?

42:13.408 --> 42:17.285
Exactly.
Oh,uh, I almost forgot.

42:17.286 --> 42:22.036
Mr. Thomas has a policy about no make-up exams so the final will be 100% of your grade.

42:23.342 --> 42:25.463
J.D?
I'm starting to feel sick again.

42:39.227 --> 42:45.133
And you've been listening to the very hot J.D. McQueen.
He's actually gonna be in the studio joining us shortly, and I'm tell--

42:45.747 --> 42:49.148
Oh, hey, there he is.
What's going on?

42:49.149 --> 42:52.333
Speak of the good-looking devil, and in he walks.
Look at you. Give me some of this.
What's going on?

42:52.836 --> 42:56.258
Have a little of this. Mwah.Mwah.
Don't be jealous, girls.

42:56.259 --> 42:59.591
You were just voted by Teen People as one of the fifty most beautiful people in the world.

42:59.592 --> 43:01.592
I know. It was an honor, you know?
Were you excited?

43:02.206 --> 43:05.784
It was a little weird. Ha ha. You Know?
Yeah. Everybody has been calling all day.

43:05.785 --> 43:08.188
All the girls want to know about you and your personal life.

43:08.649 --> 43:11.877
And I heard a few rumors lately that you might have a girlfriend. Is that true?

43:12.550 --> 43:16.090
Uh, it's been really good.
I have a really good relationship  with a girl-a friend and, you know, we're having a good time and she's helping me out a lot, so...

43:16.091 --> 43:20.479
Oh, I don't want to drop a bomb here...

43:21.061 --> 43:26.067
but I think that certain someone  could be a certain London Sheridan.

43:27.282 --> 43:31.334
Ring any bells?

43:32.126 --> 43:34.335
My relationship with London is special.

43:34.336 --> 43:35.430
Really special?Come on, our listeners want to know. How special is it?
They want to know that they have a chance.

43:35.431 --> 43:39.400
We get along. We do get along.
Aha. So, you're friends, but, like, kissing friends.

43:40.092 --> 43:45.875
London and I have a special relationship.
Ah. Well, you know what, listeners? We're gonna find out all about that relationship.

43:45.876 --> 43:48.212
We'ew gonna take a break, and then we're gonna dump...

43:48.939 --> 43:50.880
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Why did you ditch me yesterday?

43:54.116 --> 43:56.337
Let me call you right back, all right?
Who was that, London?

43:57.263 --> 44:01.797
No. She has a high squeaky voice.
What makes your relationship with her so special?

44:02.843 --> 44:08.357
I don't know. I mean, we come from the same kind of world ans he's not same loser user.

44:09.353 --> 44:11.874
Well, I'm not a loser, and I'm not a user.

44:13.421 --> 44:16.101
Why don't you go back to your famous world where everyone's so special?

44:18.441 --> 44:20.362
I didn't mean it that way!

44:25.298 --> 44:26.498
J.D! J.D.!

44:29.271 --> 44:30.471
J.D, we love you!

44:36.402 --> 44:37.602
J.D!I love you!

44:43.401 --> 44:44.601
J.D, wait!

44:49.027 --> 44:51.027
I'm just a normal guy.

44:51.483 --> 44:54.853
Well, almost, but not quite.
Now, listen, I got the press here.

44:54.854 --> 44:57.287
I want lots of smiles, lots of smiles.
Come on, come on, come on. Let's go. Lot's of smiles. Positive.

44:58.386 --> 45:00.515
J.D, what's it like to be in public school again?

45:01.404 --> 45:05.004
Well, I've  actually never been to public school before but I'm excited to be here.

45:05.420 --> 45:08.734
You know, I want to make some new friends and do really good in my school work and maybe even find a date for the prom.

45:09.918 --> 45:11.391
You'll have no trouble doing that.

45:11.392 --> 45:14.278
But howis this affcting your songwriting?

45:15.419 --> 45:18.247
It's kind os hard to deal with right now, you know? Because, you know, I'm back in school, and... but it will be dealt with soon.

45:18.869 --> 45:22.172
So, is mom happy now that you're back in school?

45:22.657 --> 45:25.244
She is now.
Thanks very much, fellas. Thank you, guys.
Tanks, J.D.

45:26.349 --> 45:29.147
Are you interested?
Oh, I am more than interested.

45:29.148 --> 45:32.239
I'm not talking some tabloid puff story about my date with J.D. McQueen.

45:32.818 --> 45:36.225
I'm talking about the stuff that goes on after and I'll provite photos.

45:36.226 --> 45:40.854
Of what?
Of me.

45:41.745 --> 45:47.151
I want the article to feature photos of me. And I want to be on the cover.
Well, if you want a cover story, you have to uncover a story.

45:48.591 --> 45:49.791
Heh. Done.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.096
This isn't a home. It's a hotel.

46:03.664 --> 46:04.864
"Do not disturb"

46:19.537 --> 46:20.837
Scumbag.

46:22.532 --> 46:24.532
I think that's one word.

46:35.570 --> 46:38.752
So.. how long you been singing?

46:39.527 --> 46:40.727
About three weeks.

46:53.536 --> 46:58.140
Diamonds are forever.
Keep in touch.

47:09.211 --> 47:12.115
So.. how's it going?

47:13.395 --> 47:14.595
A little writer's block.

47:18.180 --> 47:21.451
This high school thing isn't gonna be a problem, is it?

47:22.590 --> 47:26.326
I sure hope not.
Great, cause it just wouldn't be the same

47:27.031 --> 47:30.139
managing someone else.
Someone else?

47:30.985 --> 47:35.208
Grant, it'll just be the summer tour I'll miss.
Not according to your record label.

47:36.441 --> 47:39.182
If you're not out on tour this summer you're out--

47:40.178 --> 47:41.383
period.

47:41.384 --> 47:42.784
What do you mean, period?

47:44.827 --> 47:48.767
J.D, the music industry is a factory.

47:48.768 --> 47:52.395
You and every other artist are on their conveyor belt.

47:52.842 --> 47:56.747
It's a business, and avery business is about making money.

47:57.497 --> 48:00.388
As far as they're concerned, it's record, tour, and sell...

48:02.643 --> 48:04.778
or else you're finished.

48:08.248 --> 48:12.573
Are you serious?
I promised I would never lie to you.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.260
Tanks.

48:18.393 --> 48:19.593
Yeah.

48:25.034 --> 48:30.380
Asa ca, gandeste-te la asta.

48:35.894 --> 48:37.194
So, just...just think about, ok?
See you later, partner.

48:46.145 --> 48:48.608
You gave him back the car?
Are you serious?

48:49.139 --> 48:52.592
He's not my perfect match.
He's one of Teen People's fifty hottest.

48:53.289 --> 48:56.825
His news album is climbing the charts.
What's wrong with you?

48:58.832 --> 49:00.032
Come here.

49:01.496 --> 49:05.502
Tell the story again.
Oh, we've told you a hundred times.

49:05.503 --> 49:07.098
No,no. come on, one more time for Abby.

49:08.712 --> 49:10.712
Ok. Well, it was  New York City

49:12.626 --> 49:17.087
and was May

49:17.746 --> 49:21.035
Just thinking of that day makes me thirsty.

49:22.240 --> 49:28.588
My friend Sally called me and her new beau had this friend I should come over and meet.

49:29.049 --> 49:33.597
I dind't rven want to go out that day but I made a promise to my pal Ray.

49:34.377 --> 49:37.559
Your friend was totally psychic. She knews you two were destined to be together.

49:37.560 --> 49:43.915
Friend? No. On our way to the subway Henrietta popped into the five and dime to get a soda.

49:43.916 --> 49:49.340
And there was this handsome man behind the counter.
I promised Ray I would cover his shift at the soda fountain.

49:49.341 --> 49:55.216
That soda was the best drink I ever had.
Aw.

49:59.196 --> 50:00.396
Tanks. See?

50:03.112 --> 50:05.552
Speaking of which, would you like to get a soda?

50:05.829 --> 50:07.997
I'd love to.
Want to share one?

50:08.348 --> 50:10.329
No, I want one of my own.

50:19.227 --> 50:22.476
See? That's how it happens.
A perfect match.

50:23.313 --> 50:27.870
No heartbreak, no divorse, no lonely nights at home watching sappy romance movies.

50:28.777 --> 50:32.434
You came uo with this whole perfect match stuff because you're afraid of failing at relationships.

50:32.435 --> 50:34.802
You're boyfriend-aphobic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

50:50.810 --> 50:54.534
Keep the change.
I've never even seen a $ 100-bill before.

50:59.980 --> 51:04.526
Gee, you can free refills for life.
Oh, that's great. Tanks.

51:06.517 --> 51:11.902
Hey, Jane. You know, most people just want to be friends with me  cause I'm famous.

51:12.651 --> 51:16.319
Lucky you.
Not really.

51:17.253 --> 51:19.116
I'm a pop star, which means that at any time, pop, it's all over.

51:20.157 --> 51:23.583
Then someone else is popular  and anyone who likes J.D. McQueen is a total geek.

51:24.128 --> 51:29.351
I'm already a geek.

51:30.541 --> 51:33.423
The truth is, you're from a completely different world.
Imean, everybody recognizes you.

51:35.095 --> 51:37.657
Everybody likes you.
Everyone knows you.

51:38.833 --> 51:41.424
But I don't know enyone. I mean, think about it.
The only person I really know is you.

51:51.790 --> 51:55.538
So, when did your parents get divorced?
Six years ago, Christmas day.

51:55.539 --> 52:00.866
Heh. So, they wanted to ruin every Christmas for the rest your life?

52:00.867 --> 52:05.463
I don't think they planned it.
Mom got mad.

52:05.464 --> 52:07.255
Dad got a turkey on his lap and everything else on his head.

52:08.363 --> 52:11.377
You know, two years ago, my parents asked me what I wanted for my birthday.

52:13.327 --> 52:16.681
And I just told them I wanted them to stop fighting, and my dad moved out later that night.

52:18.262 --> 52:19.462
I did not need this today.

52:24.816 --> 52:27.587
Dad, what's the matter?

52:28.336 --> 52:32.216
Oh, God.
Diane's not home yet I got a lecture in ten minutes, and the car won't start.

52:32.796 --> 52:34.217
Take Jane's car.

52:36.631 --> 52:37.831
You sure?
Yeah, sure.

52:40.900 --> 52:42.100
Oh, thanks.

52:42.455 --> 52:44.789
Carry on.
Bye, Dad.

53:02.003 --> 53:06.031
So, what are you doing Saturday night?
Oh, PBS is running this series on the American presidents.

53:06.930 --> 53:11.267
Dang. I was kind of hoping I could take you out.
I'll tape it.

53:20.502 --> 53:21.702
OK.
Men can't resist a flat tummy. Isometric hold for ten seconds.

53:21.703 --> 53:25.114
1,2...3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.
Now lay flat on your back.

53:29.178 --> 53:30.378
You got that part down.

53:32.390 --> 53:36.350
Did you hear Mr. Thomas gave kevin an "F"?

53:37.137 --> 53:39.351
I heard. That totally sucks he got caught cheating.

53:40.180 --> 53:43.505
No, it sucls that he cheated, not that he got caught.
Ask anyone who cheats. Is it the cheating

53:44.215 --> 53:45.506
or getting caught that sucks?

53:59.367 --> 54:00.567
Cheaters suck.
And ten more seconds.

54:03.021 --> 54:04.986
I hate my smile.
Oh, no, a zit!

54:26.162 --> 54:27.362
I do it the old-fashioned way.

54:29.392 --> 54:30.592
Ow!
Sorry. Ha ha ha.
God.

54:32.932 --> 54:37.653
Jane, you need to be careful.
At some point, this fairy tale is gonna end.

54:38.313 --> 54:44.452
It' not like you're gonna marry him and tou're not prepared for heartbreak.

54:45.758 --> 54:48.346
What are you talking about?
J.D. and I are just friends and that's all we're gonna be-- just friends.

54:50.880 --> 54:53.251
Honey, I'm home.
How was your show, dear?

54:53.841 --> 54:58.811
Exhausting.
We did three encores  and Grant needs all the new songs by Monday so I'll be busy this weekened.

54:58.812 --> 55:04.533
Well, this will make you feel better. I made your favorite -- cream pie.
You are just perfect.

55:06.052 --> 55:08.150
I hope there's enough for everyone.
I brought some freinds over.

55:08.151 --> 55:09.351
Come on in, girls.

55:20.575 --> 55:23.540
You're Jane, right?
I'm Grant Powers, J.D.'s manager and trust me, taking care of things is what I do best.

55:24.571 --> 55:27.571
J.D. sent you?

55:27.572 --> 55:32.460
It's time for you to get off work and for us to go do a little shopping.

55:49.586 --> 55:52.878
This must be wrong.
Jane, come here.

55:56.680 --> 55:59.590
How about that?
No way. I'd be totally afraid to wear that.

56:00.208 --> 56:05.836
It looks really expensive.
Jane, it's time to be fearless.

56:06.926 --> 56:14.988
I don't think J.D. would like that.
Heh. Trust me.

56:17.755 --> 56:20.536
And as far as the price goes... I told you I'm here t otake care of things, right?

56:21.225 --> 56:24.204
You are gonna blow J.D.'s mind when he sees you in this dress.
I feel like Im in a fairy tale.

56:25.220 --> 56:27.193
Yeah? How about lunch?
Oh, no. I'm late for an appointment. I got to go.

56:27.194 --> 56:29.447
Wait, Jane, your stuff.

56:30.029 --> 56:31.759
Oh. I'm sorry. I got to go. I'm really late.

56:32.288 --> 56:35.299
Jane, have a great time.

56:41.131 --> 56:42.331
Poor kid.

57:02.328 --> 57:03.528
Thanks.

57:19.514 --> 57:23.314
Oh, this is so exciting.
Samantha, qill you get your sister, please?
Jane!

57:23.515 --> 57:24.715
Thank you, Sam. Thank you.

57:26.588 --> 57:28.970
Hi J.D.
Hi.
Jane's almost ready. Come on in.

57:29.868 --> 57:32.810
Hey, will you take Jane to her dad's tonight after your date?
Yeah, no problem.

57:32.811 --> 57:34.011
Thank you.

57:50.850 --> 57:54.938
You look, uh, uh..

57:55.524 --> 57:56.823
Take your time. It'll come to you!

57:59.847 --> 58:02.847
Ok, you kids be safe.
Behave.

58:03.727 --> 58:05.048
Bye, Jane.
See you guys later. Bye.

58:27.203 --> 58:29.928
I've never been in a limo before.

58:30.777 --> 58:33.887
This is so cool.
It's no big deal. You get used to it after a while.

58:36.571 --> 58:40.156
So, where are we going?
We are going to the music awards.

58:40.739 --> 58:42.714
The what?
The music awards. It's cool.

58:45.147 --> 58:46.447
This isn't really happening.

59:25.820 --> 59:30.136
Guys, come on, come on.
J.D., J.D., can I have you for a minute? Hey, man, love the new album.

59:30.137 --> 59:34.968
Thank you very much. I appreciate that.
I notice you briught a girl here to the awards. What's the relationship?

59:36.707 --> 59:39.789
Well, she's a good friend.
Any comment on your relatinship with London?

59:40.478 --> 59:43.396
Another good friend.Hey, man, variety-- it'd the spice of life.

59:43.397 --> 59:45.397
Well, it's good to be J.D. McQueen.

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:02.064
Jane?

01:00:29.055 --> 01:00:31.909
So, did you have a good time tonight?
Are you kidding me? It was incredible.

01:00:32.908 --> 01:00:36.520
Hey, I'm sorry I had to keep leaving you to do those interviews.

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:41.959
It's just all part of the business.
Well, I'm sorry that you didn't win.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:43.960
Next year, it'll be you.Yeah. Maybe, maybe not.

01:00:50.543 --> 01:00:52.809
Oh, my toe.
Dad, you're an idiot.

01:00:54.744 --> 01:00:59.312
I never noticed, but you have a great smile.

01:00:59.313 --> 01:01:02.019
Imi place e foart dragut.
No, I hate it.

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.820
No, I like it. It's cute.
You have this thing.
In my teeth?

01:01:10.821 --> 01:01:12.256
No. This thing that breaks me down.

01:01:12.926 --> 01:01:21.262
Jane, I'm two different people.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:26.575
J.D. is this amazing, super cool, supert confident kid.
He's the guy all the girls want.

01:01:27.986 --> 01:01:32.221
But when I'm with you  I'm just plain old Joe McQueen.
I like Joe.

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:37.609
Well, I don't. There's nothing special about Joe right down to the name.
What's wrong with the name Joe?
Average Joe, Joe Schmoe, Joe Blow.

01:01:38.637 --> 01:01:44.348
Ok, Ok, ook, You don't like my smile.
That's my point. Joe loves your smile.

01:01:46.233 --> 01:01:48.233
I love your smile. Really, I do.

01:02:02.988 --> 01:02:08.626
Jane, do me a favor. Please don't tell anybody about this.
I want to keep it our secret.

01:02:23.084 --> 01:02:26.084
I can't believe it!
You're in Teen People!

01:02:27.653 --> 01:02:30.653
Ha ha ha! Let's read it. Whoo!

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.180
"Variety is the spice of life?"

01:02:36.909 --> 01:02:42.333
So, what's going on with you and the super freak?
She's telling everyone you guys are soul mates.

01:02:43.374 --> 01:02:45.700
I think I heard something about a wedding as soon as you turn eighteen.

01:02:46.258 --> 01:02:48.635
What?
You're mad. I can tell.

01:02:48.636 --> 01:02:51.106
I'm not mad.
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:55.156
J.D, dif you gave me a chance I would treat you like a king.

01:02:56.656 --> 01:03:02.820
Come on, I already told everybody you're taking me to the prom.
No, thanks.

01:03:03.539 --> 01:03:06.821
I put my entire high school reputation on the line.
I'm sorry, Whitney.

01:03:07.344 --> 01:03:13.153
Fine. You leave me no choice. If you don't ask me out I'll tell everyone you're a lip syncer.

01:03:13.675 --> 01:03:17.453
You know that's not true.
Tell it t othe tabloids bacause that's gonna be quite a story.

01:03:19.237 --> 01:03:21.237
Look, all I'm asking for is one night  with the J.D McQueen.

01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:38.001
In my twenty-three years as a janitor  I've seen spray paint  krazy glue, graffiti, gum.

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:45.123
I've never serrn anything like this.

01:03:45.124 --> 01:03:49.209
Now, here's an item that no J.D. fan should be without.

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:54.030
That's right, J.D.'s locker.
Does anyone want it? $ 100.
I take 100.
$100.

01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:56.031
J.D. is diciding who he's gonna ask to prom at this very moment.
And who's he gonna pick? Me.

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:05.272
What about Jane Brighton?
When school's finished...she is finished

01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:10.830
You're right. She won't be here next year like you.

01:04:18.282 --> 01:04:20.282
Whitney, will go to prom with me?

01:04:21.938 --> 01:04:26.766
Hi. Uh, Justin. I realize you're, like, the hottest girl in school.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:35.836
I probably shouldn't even try asking you...

01:04:36.626 --> 01:04:41.426
but a wise man once told me that the... um... the true losers in life

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:44.331
are not who, uh, try ahn fail but those who fail to try.

01:04:46.742 --> 01:04:50.070
So, uh, you--you want t ogo to the prom with me, Whitney?

01:04:52.543 --> 01:04:54.378
Yes.
You will?

01:04:56.411 --> 01:05:00.106
If you do three things.
OK.
Lose thirty pounds, grow six inches, then win the lottery ahd give all the money.

01:05:01.013 --> 01:05:04.775
What was that first thing?

01:05:05.858 --> 01:05:07.718
Get lost.

01:05:07.719 --> 01:05:09.719
Seriously.
Let's go.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.766
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so I had it twice.

01:05:24.037 --> 01:05:25.246
I trew up.
Are you all right?

01:05:25.981 --> 01:05:29.686
It's the grades that aren't all right.
A-B-C-D...F.

01:05:31.742 --> 01:05:34.454
Why'd they skip "E"?
Because failure starts with "F".

01:05:35.003 --> 01:05:42.762
Yeah, but "C" is for average, which starts with an "A".
And "A" is for excellent, which starts with an "E". And "D" is for below average, which atarts with a "B".

01:05:43.686 --> 01:05:47.101
And "B" is for above average, which starts with an "A".

01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:51.000
Think about it. "F" is the only one that makes sense.
You're burning up.

01:05:52.539 --> 01:06:02.347
My point is, grades are just so stupid. They don't make sence.
Jane, if I don't get an answer to a question, is it OK--

01:06:03.768 --> 01:06:07.189
It's ok. Just skip it and then go back to it. You'll do fine.

01:06:11.098 --> 01:06:12.298
You right, you right.

01:06:15.006 --> 01:06:16.206
I can do this.

01:06:48.625 --> 01:06:50.625
Turn your tests over and begin.

01:09:01.747 --> 01:09:04.743
What was that?
Wat?

01:09:04.745 --> 01:09:07.290
I saw you. You cheated off me.
Jane! Shh! Keep quiet!

01:09:07.733 --> 01:09:10.862
This was your plan all along.
Everything was a lie.

01:09:11.323 --> 01:09:16.421
I shouldn't seen this a mile away.
"Here's the car. How about a date? Even a kiss?" All I have to do is let you copy off of me and not say anything.

01:09:17.066 --> 01:09:23.201
What if you had gotten caught?
Mr. Thomas would've thought that I was helping you. I would've gotten suspended. I would've lost my scholarships.

01:09:25.176 --> 01:09:28.707
But you don't care, do you?
Listen, I get nervous when I take tests.

01:09:25.582 --> 01:09:33.064
Next thing, you're gonna tell me that you have stage fright.
No, it only happens when I take tests.

01:09:33.064 --> 01:09:35.694
My whole body freezes up.

01:09:35.696 --> 01:09:41.560
I'm so stupied.
You're not stupied. I cheated because I have to pass my classes--

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:44.854
I don't care why. You cheated.
Who cheated?

01:09:52.993 --> 01:09:58.600
He cheated on me with another girl.
But now I know of person he is...

01:09:59.776 --> 01:10:01.776
I don't ever want to see him again.

01:10:15.843 --> 01:10:20.742
You know what makes a diamond?
Is this one of those stories where I'm a lump pf coal?

01:10:21.515 --> 01:10:28.270
Tha flaws, Jane. It's the flaws that make life precious.
I understand. You're saying J.D. was a mistake.

01:10:28.271 --> 01:10:36.176
No. No. I'm saying don't be afraid of mistakes.

01:10:36.177 --> 01:10:42.804
Listen, if it weren't for the bad times the good times wouldn't seem so good.
Now, as for me, I'm gonna go to the salon.

01:10:44.867 --> 01:10:46.067
It's a good idea.
OK.

01:11:27.623 --> 01:11:32.980
And now for tody's showcase special. That's right.
For $ 100, I've got J.D.'s gym--
Hey! You little--
Run, everybody.

01:11:35.298 --> 01:11:40.764
What do you think you're doing?
Where do you think you're going?

01:11:45.864 --> 01:11:51.380
Don't you think it's messed up tp sell my shorts for $ 100?
Yeah, I do. I could get 200, easy.

01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:57.120
I hate this stupid school.
If you can't change the wind, adjust your sail

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.220
What's that supposed to mean?
You can't change the influences of those around you but you can change the way you respond.

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:06.150
Heh. So, you're saying I should take control.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:26.605
Mr. Thomas?
There's something I have to tell you.

01:14:38.029 --> 01:14:41.450
J.D told Mr. Thomas he cheated off you and Mr. Thomas flunked him.

01:14:41.451 --> 01:14:43.833
I don't believe it.
Why would he do that?

01:14:44.315 --> 01:14:47.707
Why do you care? You once said "It's the cheating not the getting caught that sucks."
Remember?

01:14:48.416 --> 01:14:52.633
Do you really think there's such a thing as fear of tests?
Yeah, right. Testophobia?

01:15:11.996 --> 01:15:15.598
Testophobia is for real.
Just because is on internet doesn't mean it's real.

01:15:20.631 --> 01:15:23.581
Hey, Sam. Is Jane home?
She's not here.

01:15:24.571 --> 01:15:26.590
I really messed up, huh?
I have to go to school.

01:15:27.258 --> 01:15:29.591
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

01:15:33.136 --> 01:15:35.136
I think I love her, Sam.

01:15:35.137 --> 01:15:38.724
For show and tell, I was gonna bring some owl puke I found...

01:15:40.209 --> 01:15:43.917
but I think this is one better.

01:15:44.839 --> 01:15:49.866
Please welcome J.D McQueen.
singer, dancer, songwriter and my friend.

01:15:50.957 --> 01:15:52.957
Hi, J.D.!
Hi, J.D.!

01:15:55.097 --> 01:15:58.212
What's it like when every girl wants to kiss you?

01:15:59.316 --> 01:16:03.058
That's not true. Is it?
What's it like being J.D McQueen?

01:16:04.076 --> 01:16:06.076
Well, being an atertainer is a lot like any job.

01:16:08.447 --> 01:16:11.133
There's deadlines, bosses, and a lot of pressure.

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:20.070
You gotta remember, it is a business.
But being J.D. McQueen is a lot easier than being Joe McQueen.

01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:27.384
You see, J.D.-- he's just an act. But Joe-- he's the guy who has to pick up all the pieces when the screaming stops.

01:16:29.702 --> 01:16:31.718
Who's Joe?
I am.

01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:37.838
A.J., do you have a question?
J.D., can I have your autograph?

01:16:38.513 --> 01:16:43.476
Autographs are $ 3,00, a picture with J.D. is 10 and kisses are 20.

01:16:44.182 --> 01:16:47.352
Kisses?
This is way better than my lemonade stand.

01:16:48.131 --> 01:16:58.773
Simply put, it's the fear of tanking tests.
It's what therapists call a social phobia or anxiety disorder.

01:16:58.774 --> 01:17:04.049
So, someone can perform in front of thousands of people ans still have fear of tests?

01:17:04.604 --> 01:17:07.848
Yes, is happens. A lot of people get performance anxiety. It just takes on different forms.
Dr. Brighton, your 4:00 appointment is here.

01:17:09.226 --> 01:17:14.826
Have him wait. This is important.

01:17:14.827 --> 01:17:19.514
So, some entertainers get chronic panic attacks so severe that the become physically ill with headaches, fever, even vomiting.

01:17:19.515 --> 01:17:23.158
That sounds like J.D. right before the test.

01:17:24.087 --> 01:17:28.410
Thanks, Diane. I really appreciate it.
You're welcome. I'm glad I could help.

01:17:35.241 --> 01:17:37.241
Yeah, that's great, Stevie. We'll, uh, we'll get back to you, ok?
Mr. Powers, the next audition's here. I'm sending him in.

01:17:49.299 --> 01:17:53.079
Mr Thomas?
I know why J.D. cheated.

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:57.724
No sob stories, Miss Brighton.
He knows the material. He just freezes up on the tests.

01:17:58.194 --> 01:18:03.862
This matter has nothing to do with you.
This matter has everything to do with me.

01:18:03.863 --> 01:18:07.761
I know exactly what it's like to stress out about a test.
I mean, to be afraid that you're gonna do your best and that you're gonna get the right answer?

01:18:08.234 --> 01:18:11.319
But, Jane, those feelings are perfectly normal.
Perfectly normal. Heh. Thanks.

01:18:12.661 --> 01:18:20.743
Because God knows if I wanted t obe normal I'd to be perfectly normal.
I'm obsessed with perfection with finding the perfect boyfriend, with picking the perfect school.

01:18:21.425 --> 01:18:27.590
Mr. Thomas, I got a perfect 1600 on my S.A.T.'s.
People don't call me perfectly normal. Thay call me a freak.

01:18:29.126 --> 01:18:33.217
J.D is the opposite side of that coin.
I fire up for tests, he freezes.

01:18:35.899 --> 01:18:39.923
Give J.D. a second chance.
You know my rule.

01:18:41.021 --> 01:18:44.850
You taught. He learned.
I can prove that.

01:18:45.227 --> 01:18:49.386
J.D just needs to be in his special place.

01:18:52.139 --> 01:18:57.785
Grades have to be in by final bell today.
Any proving has to be done before then.

01:19:17.171 --> 01:19:21.231
Yes?
Mrs. McQueen, J.D. needs to be at Mr. Thomas' office by 2:00.

01:19:22.233 --> 01:19:25.156
Joe is at the airport. He's gone to New York to see his dad.

01:19:26.221 --> 01:19:27.421
The airport?

01:19:34.794 --> 01:19:35.994
Come on, come on, come on!

01:19:37.467 --> 01:19:39.467
Come on, people, move!

01:19:48.039 --> 01:19:52.774
All I know is, your mom said to pick you up at the executive terminal and to get your butt back to school.

01:20:03.490 --> 01:20:08.317
Up there is a pretty scary place for most o us.
But Jane seems to think it's your special place.

01:22:10.341 --> 01:22:13.896
So, what'd you think?
Pretty difficult.

01:22:16.255 --> 01:22:20.815
Ought to be. It's a test to weigh first-year college calculus.

01:22:53.497 --> 01:22:55.497
Well, Jane's not gonna like this very much.

01:22:59.365 --> 01:23:01.365
You did better than she did.
I did?

01:23:13.465 --> 01:23:14.665
Yes!

01:23:16.757 --> 01:23:17.957
Here.

01:23:18.842 --> 01:23:20.058
It's from Grant.

01:23:24.549 --> 01:23:25.749
"J.D McQueen interview".?

01:23:36.772 --> 01:23:39.746
Another good friend. Hey, man-- variety. It's the spice of life.

01:23:39.747 --> 01:23:44.821
Well, it's good to be J.D. McQueen.
Now, a lot of girls want to know what would it take to be your perfect girl?

01:23:45.876 --> 01:23:49.982
Well, she'd have to be realy smart and a good friend but there's algo this--this thing.
This thing?

01:23:50.757 --> 01:23:54.717
This thing, I love this one girl's smile. I really do.
I mean, she's amazing.

01:23:55.668 --> 01:24:03.192
Listen, I gotta go. It was nice talking to you.
Whoa, sounds pretty heavy.

01:24:04.649 --> 01:24:08.311
It wasn't all a lie.
How come that wasn't in the article?

01:24:08.312 --> 01:24:12.758
Cause that's not J.D. talking. Tha's Joe.

01:24:16.716 --> 01:24:17.916
I want you to wear this.

01:24:20.502 --> 01:24:26.256
Oh. Mom. I can't wear that. That's yours.

01:24:26.257 --> 01:24:29.257
Every princess needs a necklace.
And a lady in waiting.

01:24:30.155 --> 01:24:36.316
And...a chaperon.
Oh, Mary! You look so gorgeous!

01:24:39.272 --> 01:24:42.551
Ladies and gentlemen,
J.D McQueen.

01:24:54.751 --> 01:24:56.751
What's up, everybody? How y'all doing out there?
You feel good?

01:25:03.708 --> 01:25:04.908
Jane, uh, are you out there?

01:25:08.156 --> 01:25:09.822
You picked her over me?

01:25:10.457 --> 01:25:12.823
How can you do that?? Ohh! Stop it!

01:25:16.531 --> 01:25:18.031
Whitney Addison wears a water bra!

01:25:31.326 --> 01:25:36.406
Listen, everyone, I'm kicking off summer tour right here, right now, in my hometown.

01:25:37.009 --> 01:25:42.661
But if it weren't for some very special people the only thing I'd be kicking off this summer is my shoes.

01:25:43.084 --> 01:25:46.227
First off, I'd like to thank my parents...

01:25:46.228 --> 01:25:49.089
for always making sure I did my best and not letting me cheat myself out of my full potencial.

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:53.718
Most importantly, I'd like to thank Jane Brightman.

01:25:53.719 --> 01:25:56.976
You taught me everything.
Thank you.

01:26:06.595 --> 01:26:09.377
Is this seat taken?
Uh,no, please. Ha ha. It's all yours.

01:26:22.276 --> 01:26:26.578
The kid's pretty good, isn't he?
Excellent. And he's cute, too.

01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:30.909
That kid's got talent.

01:26:35.799 --> 01:26:39.725
Justin. My names's Justin.
I used t odate a guy named Justin. My name's London.

01:26:56.462 --> 01:27:02.843
Dating many girls makes the heart feel old.
Finding the right woman makes it feel young again.

01:27:06.084 --> 01:27:11.657
Uh, did you hear that there's prom coming up?
I never got to go to my prom. I was actually really bummed.

01:27:13.009 --> 01:27:18.371
Really? Wll,uh... would you--Idon't know--would you like to go with me?

01:27:19.202 --> 01:27:21.372
Sure, that sounds great.
Ohh! Heh!

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:30.159
Hi, I'm Grant-- J.D.'s manager.
I'm Faith--Jane's mom.

01:27:32.288 --> 01:27:35.098
I was just gonna go get a soda.
You want one?

01:27:37.028 --> 01:27:42.368
I'd live one.
That could be the best soda she ever had.

01:28:07.337 --> 01:28:09.604
Where have you been? We haven't seen you since the wedding.

01:28:12.925 --> 01:28:15.883
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's OK.

01:28:16.667 --> 01:28:22.785
It's not your fault. Um, I'm just not ready to be out yet.
I,uh, I need to go home.

01:28:51.814 --> 01:28:56.086
Yesterday's history. Tomorrow's a mystery. Today's a gift.

01:28:58.650 --> 01:28:59.850
That's why it's called the present.

01:29:46.726 --> 01:29:51.183
I always knew you'd do well on the test.
You just needed to be in your own special place.

01:29:52.045 --> 01:29:58.393
Actually onstage in front of a whole bunch of empty seats that's my biggest fear.

01:29:59.736 --> 01:30:02.736
If I can ace the test there, I can ace the test anywhere.

01:30:03.916 --> 01:30:09.306
It's because of you I passed.
Heh. And I finished writing my first story because of you.

01:30:10.264 --> 01:30:14.314
Really?
What's it about?

01:30:14.315 --> 01:30:16.811
It's a fairy tale about a high school girl who falls in love with a prince.

01:30:17.463 --> 01:30:23.214
Don't tell me. They get married, they fell in love, and they live happily--
No, I dont know about that.

01:30:23.978 --> 01:30:26.726
Well, how does it end?
With a kiss.

01:30:35.094 --> 01:30:37.411
A kiss that could last a lifetime.

01:30:38.305 --> 01:30:44.670
