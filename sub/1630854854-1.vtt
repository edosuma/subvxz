00:22.313 --> 00:23.732
Thank you.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.609
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.361
I don't want
to be negative, but...

00:28.445 --> 00:29.696
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:29.779 --> 00:32.615
...I don't think anything's ever
gonna get better ever again.

00:32.699 --> 00:37.203
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:37.287 --> 00:39.456
I don't wanna bum anybody out,
but I think this is pretty much

00:39.539 --> 00:42.083
the way it's gonna be
for however long it takes us

00:42.167 --> 00:46.379
- to polish this planet off.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:46.463 --> 00:48.548
And don't misunderstand me,
I have no hope.

00:48.631 --> 00:51.050
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:51.134 --> 00:53.803
I think if you have hope,
what are you, fucking seven?

00:53.887 --> 00:56.806
- So...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:56.890 --> 00:59.017
...again, I don't want
to be negative,

00:59.100 --> 01:01.019
but you kinda know
it's true, right?

01:01.102 --> 01:03.897
In your heart, you know
that it's fucking over, right?

01:03.980 --> 01:06.775
- I know it's hard to handle...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:06.858 --> 01:09.027
...culturally, politically,
climate-wise.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.863
What are you gonna do
about the climate? Nothing.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.823
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:13.907 --> 01:15.617
I think in the back
of our heads we're like,

01:15.700 --> 01:17.452
"Well, you know,
I don't wanna get in the way

01:17.535 --> 01:20.663
of anything that Swedish
teenager's doing, you know?"

01:20.747 --> 01:22.791
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:22.874 --> 01:24.793
Like, "Greta's got focus,
she's young,

01:24.876 --> 01:28.880
- I think she's gonna nail it."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:28.963 --> 01:30.507
And, look, I don't know.
I... You know,

01:30.590 --> 01:32.467
I have moments where I'm like,

01:32.550 --> 01:34.677
"What can I do?"
And then you're like,

01:34.761 --> 01:37.388
"What? Is that gnocchi?"
You know, so, like it's...

01:37.472 --> 01:42.852
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:45.063 --> 01:48.066
Look, I'm doing a thing,
that, uh, occasionally I'll--

01:48.149 --> 01:49.275
Well, yeah, I'll do it now.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.153
Just like, a lot of these ideas
that I'm playing with,

01:52.237 --> 01:53.780
they're hard to do, comedically.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.490
So I've been working
on a one-man show,

01:55.573 --> 01:58.117
sort of a serious one-man show,
and I workshop it

01:58.201 --> 01:59.994
during the comedy act
occasionally.

02:00.703 --> 02:01.746
I'll do it for you now.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.123
It's called
<i>Voices From the Future.</i>

02:04.207 --> 02:06.000
This is a multi-character
one-person show

02:06.084 --> 02:07.544
where I play all the characters.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.546
If you ever are like,
you know, "Where's Marc?"

02:09.629 --> 02:13.341
- It's still me, I'm here.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

02:14.968 --> 02:17.512
So this is a one-person show,

02:17.595 --> 02:18.763
it's called
<i>Voices From the Future.</i>

02:18.847 --> 02:21.307
It's just random people
saying random things

02:21.391 --> 02:22.517
in the very near future.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.728
The show right now is running
about a minute and 30.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.689
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

02:27.772 --> 02:29.524
I picture that,
when I produce it,

02:29.607 --> 02:31.693
it'll be
in a small black box theater.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.778
You know, it'll be dark
and the lights will like,

02:33.862 --> 02:36.531
come up on each character,
but I'll just kinda mime that.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.867
- But you'll get it.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

02:38.950 --> 02:40.702
Some references
are to the West Coast,

02:40.785 --> 02:43.246
but I think you'll get them
and maybe I'll throw one

02:43.329 --> 02:46.291
that's-- in that's
more appropriate to this coast.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.917
Yeah, I'll have to do
a whole new character,

02:48.001 --> 02:49.836
but I think I can do it.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.630
Right, so this is the first guy,
<i>Voices From the Future.</i>

02:52.714 --> 02:56.426
Okay, first guy, lights come up.
"How close are the fires?"

02:56.509 --> 02:59.095
- Lights down.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

03:03.308 --> 03:04.350
All right, this... (CHUCKLES)

03:04.434 --> 03:06.769
...this is the second guy,
lights up.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.355
"Will the fifth booster
work on the Zephyr strain?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.649
'Cause I can't see
out of this eye, doc.

03:11.733 --> 03:16.070
- I can't see." Lights down.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

03:16.154 --> 03:18.740
All right, this is--
This guy. All right, this is--

03:18.823 --> 03:22.035
Hold on, this guy's sad.
(BREATHES DEEPLY) Okay.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.245
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- Lights up.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.873
"What, do you mean--
You mean there's no more water?"

03:26.956 --> 03:31.502
- Bring the lights down.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

03:31.586 --> 03:34.964
Wait. All right, wait, there's--
Okay. So a East Coast one.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.341
All right,
this guy's a-- All right.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.885
All right. Okay, okay,
here we go. (GROANS) Lights up.

03:38.968 --> 03:40.511
"Do they have
the floatable seating

03:40.595 --> 03:43.973
- at the restaurant downtown?"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

03:44.057 --> 03:48.311
Okay. Now, this last guy--

03:48.394 --> 03:50.480
So, if you're doing this
at your community theater

03:50.563 --> 03:52.941
- or, uh, your high school...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

03:53.024 --> 03:54.108
...uh, you'd want to cast, like,

03:54.192 --> 03:56.444
a working-class guy
for this last guy

03:56.527 --> 03:58.112
'cause he's kind of
the comic relief at the end.

03:58.196 --> 04:02.784
Okay. (GROANS) Lights up.
"You know, 130 is not that hot."

04:02.867 --> 04:04.535
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

04:04.619 --> 04:06.621
"Once you get out in it,
it's not that bad.

04:06.704 --> 04:08.706
Don't be a pussy and hydrate!"

04:09.958 --> 04:11.125
Thank you,
<i>Voices From the Future.</i>

04:11.209 --> 04:16.214
- Appreciate it.
- (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING, CHEERING)

04:19.592 --> 04:22.136
So, like, I'm trying to cover
a lot of territory,

04:22.220 --> 04:24.430
or a lot of things
in this first chunk

04:24.514 --> 04:26.641
of this show,
and it gets a little heavy,

04:26.724 --> 04:27.684
but you'll be all right.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.560
- Um...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

04:29.644 --> 04:31.688
There's-- I think we have
a stupid people problem

04:31.771 --> 04:34.232
and I'm not saying that
as a condescending person

04:34.315 --> 04:36.109
or a-- I'm not a genius,

04:36.192 --> 04:38.319
but I kinda miss
old-timey stupid.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.697
You know,
I miss back-in-the-day stupid.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.949
I miss, like,
ten-years-ago stupid.

04:43.032 --> 04:45.076
You know, stupid that
had a little humility,

04:45.159 --> 04:47.370
where you could say things
like, "You're kinda dumb,"

04:47.453 --> 04:48.913
and they'd be like,
"Yeah, I know."

04:48.997 --> 04:51.416
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

04:53.293 --> 04:54.377
"Well, it's good you know that."

04:54.460 --> 04:56.879
"Well, I'm not that dumb.
I mean, come on!"

04:56.963 --> 04:58.881
"Well, good talk.
Good luck with everything."

04:58.965 --> 05:01.551
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
- But now, there's a new stupid,

05:01.634 --> 05:05.013
a brazen, sort of shameless,
confident stupid.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.014
They're just loaded up

05:06.097 --> 05:07.473
with all kinds
of bullshit information.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.975
It has a tone to it.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.686
I'll try to do a little
of it for ya, the tone.

05:11.769 --> 05:13.521
"Oh, so, you're a scientist?"

05:13.604 --> 05:17.650
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

05:17.734 --> 05:19.027
And you can't pull
that same thing

05:19.110 --> 05:20.820
you used to be able to pull
with the old stupid.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.613
You can't be like,
"You're kind of dumb."

05:22.697 --> 05:24.907
'Cause they go,
"What's your source?"

05:24.991 --> 05:27.285
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- "What are you talking about?"

05:27.368 --> 05:28.995
"Where are you getting
your information?"

05:29.078 --> 05:30.747
"Just talking to you right now."

05:30.830 --> 05:31.956
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

05:32.040 --> 05:33.416
"You gotta do
your own research, bro."

05:33.499 --> 05:36.252
- "I'm doing it in real time..."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

05:36.335 --> 05:38.880
"...and I think
my study's almost concluded.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.799
And I'm stepping away slowly."

05:43.092 --> 05:44.385
So now,
we're just kinda half-waiting

05:44.469 --> 05:47.263
for the stupids
to choose a uniform. Um...

05:47.346 --> 05:54.437
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

05:54.520 --> 05:56.481
I don't know. Are you nervous?

05:58.232 --> 05:59.442
Isn't it weird
that, like, you know,

05:59.525 --> 06:01.110
you get your information
one place

06:01.194 --> 06:03.196
and they get
there's another place.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.447
Everyone gets it
at different places,

06:04.530 --> 06:07.909
but there's definitely
a strain of stupid

06:07.992 --> 06:09.410
where you hear guys do, like,

06:09.494 --> 06:11.954
"You know, you don't have to get
any vaccines ever.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.248
I was listening
to this podcast."

06:14.332 --> 06:16.584
Most of the time
that's not going a good place.

06:16.667 --> 06:19.545
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- "I was with this podcast.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.339
You know,
I was kinda in and out."

06:21.422 --> 06:23.883
- "But..."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

06:23.966 --> 06:25.760
"...I'm pretty sure the guy said
that if you take

06:25.843 --> 06:28.262
a human growth hormone
suppository

06:28.346 --> 06:31.057
and stick it up your ass hard
until you get a boner,

06:31.140 --> 06:32.975
but it's not a gay boner
'cause it's your finger,

06:33.059 --> 06:34.727
- so why would it be gay?"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

06:34.811 --> 06:35.978
"And I don't know
if you know this,

06:36.062 --> 06:38.272
but there's a man clit
in your asshole that I found

06:38.356 --> 06:39.690
when I was watching UFC once.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.235
I was just poking around
up there.

06:42.318 --> 06:43.694
And I told my bros about it,
I'm like,

06:43.778 --> 06:45.238
'Do you know about the man clit
in your ass?'

06:45.321 --> 06:46.447
So, they were like,
'What the fuck, dude?'

06:46.531 --> 06:48.282
I'm like, 'All right,
you live your life.'

06:48.366 --> 06:50.409
- Anyway..."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

06:50.493 --> 06:51.744
"...so when you get the boner,

06:51.828 --> 06:53.538
you stick it
into a warm elk's heart,

06:53.621 --> 06:55.873
which you can order
from the guy's website.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.918
Comes three in a package,
frozen, and you just fuck it

06:59.001 --> 07:01.420
like a pocket pussy
or a fleshlight.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.880
It's not gay,
it's an elk's heart.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.842
- How would that be gay?"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

07:05.925 --> 07:07.051
"And then you cum in it,

07:07.135 --> 07:08.636
and then you just throw it
on a Traeger

07:08.719 --> 07:11.139
or whatever kinda grill
you have.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.849
I have a Weber,
but it doesn't matter

07:12.932 --> 07:14.308
and you cook it up
and you, like,

07:14.392 --> 07:15.685
eat it on a sandwich or--

07:15.768 --> 07:17.854
It's not gay to eat your own cum
if it's cooked.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.231
- Anyway..."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

07:20.314 --> 07:21.774
"...if you do that
and you eat it,

07:21.858 --> 07:24.360
you don't have to get vaccinated
for anything.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.821
Pretty sure
that's what the guy said.

07:26.904 --> 07:29.615
I was kinda in and out,
was ordering supplements

07:29.699 --> 07:34.871
and, a new fleshlight and,
you know, the uniforms are in,

07:34.954 --> 07:36.706
so I wanted to get
a jump on that."

07:36.789 --> 07:38.207
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

07:38.291 --> 07:40.585
"And then I think the guy
interviewed a professor

07:40.668 --> 07:44.046
- of misogyny from Canada."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

07:44.130 --> 07:45.631
"That was really smart, man.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.258
He really knew
what he was talking about.

07:47.341 --> 07:51.053
Someday when I have a woman,
I'm gonna use some of it."

07:51.137 --> 07:54.182
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

07:54.265 --> 07:55.725
And now, there's all these
comedians, like,

07:55.808 --> 07:57.393
"I'm an anti-woke comic, man.

07:57.476 --> 08:00.813
I'm anti-woke and that's why
I don't get work."

08:00.897 --> 08:03.649
- "Really?"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

08:03.733 --> 08:05.943
"You think that's the reason?"
(CHUCKLES)

08:06.027 --> 08:08.154
"Yeah, man.
We can't say anything anymore.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.615
Like, me and all the other
anti-woke comedians,

08:10.698 --> 08:13.326
we all wanna say our version
of the same three things.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.995
- And you just can't--"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

08:16.078 --> 08:18.456
"You can't say anything
anymore."

08:18.539 --> 08:20.541
"No, I'm pretty sure you can say
whatever you want, really."

08:20.625 --> 08:22.418
He's like, "No, you can't, man."

08:22.501 --> 08:26.172
"You can.
There just may be consequences."

08:26.255 --> 08:27.632
"See, that's
the fucked up thing,

08:27.715 --> 08:29.634
- the consequences."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

08:29.717 --> 08:31.052
"Well, maybe when you get
your uniform,

08:31.135 --> 08:33.554
you can make that
the first order of business,

08:33.638 --> 08:35.473
is getting rid
of the consequences."

08:35.556 --> 08:37.600
- (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
- (CHUCKLES)

08:37.683 --> 08:41.437
- "No, man. I'm anti-woke."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

08:41.520 --> 08:46.275
Look, there's problems.
You know, I don't wanna--

08:46.359 --> 08:48.319
But I don't wanna say
there's a problem

08:48.402 --> 08:52.073
- with Christian fascism, but...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

08:55.243 --> 08:56.535
...there might be a problem.

08:57.745 --> 09:00.665
And I'm not saying
you're all in on it,

09:00.748 --> 09:03.167
if you're Christians,
but, you know, you kinda are.

09:05.711 --> 09:08.714
- Right?
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

09:08.798 --> 09:10.633
Like, if you really think
a flying Jew

09:10.716 --> 09:14.470
- is gonna come back...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

09:14.553 --> 09:16.889
...and make everything okay,

09:16.973 --> 09:18.641
isn't that, like,
mental illness?

09:18.724 --> 09:21.894
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

09:24.438 --> 09:26.107
I don't wanna make anyone
uncomfortable

09:26.190 --> 09:28.776
'cause I know, a lot of you know
that we have--

09:28.859 --> 09:31.112
You know, as I'm speaking,

09:31.195 --> 09:32.780
and I guess I should
make it clear

09:32.863 --> 09:35.950
that we have found recently
that there is actually something

09:36.033 --> 09:37.535
that brings
most people together,

09:37.618 --> 09:38.786
it's antisemitism.

09:38.869 --> 09:42.707
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- And... (CLICKS TONGUE) ...yeah.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.376
I'm saying that as a Jew,

09:45.459 --> 09:49.839
and as a Jew, I'm saying
that we will replace you.

09:49.922 --> 09:53.426
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

09:53.509 --> 09:54.510
It's...

09:57.847 --> 09:59.390
it's happening,
we're all part of it.

09:59.473 --> 10:02.184
We're doing it,
we're all doing our bit.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.770
You-- There's an app now
we can replace you with.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.063
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

10:06.147 --> 10:09.984
And it's a commission thing.
How-- We get a certain kickback

10:10.067 --> 10:12.445
for the number of you replaced.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.821
I talked to my brother
last week,

10:13.904 --> 10:16.574
he replaced, like, 76 last week.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.409
And every quarter,
we get a check

10:18.492 --> 10:22.038
- from Global Control HQ.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

10:22.121 --> 10:24.165
It's got the cool logo
with the planet

10:24.248 --> 10:27.835
and the Star of David
and gold leaf around it,

10:27.918 --> 10:31.756
- signed by George Soros.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

10:31.839 --> 10:33.257
It's kinda cool,
it's almost frameable,

10:33.341 --> 10:36.886
- but we cash them. So...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

10:38.262 --> 10:40.097
And I don't know, like,
I'm not religious,

10:40.181 --> 10:41.891
I'm a Jew, so...

10:41.974 --> 10:46.103
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

10:47.313 --> 10:48.814
And there's a difference
between Jews and Christians,

10:48.898 --> 10:49.899
obviously, I mean, I think

10:49.982 --> 10:51.192
if the relationship with God
is different,

10:51.275 --> 10:54.070
if you look at the testaments,
the Old Testament.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.530
It seemed like the relationship
with Jews and God

10:56.614 --> 11:00.701
- was basically, "What?"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

11:00.785 --> 11:02.244
"What do you want me to do?

11:03.704 --> 11:05.539
Now?

11:05.623 --> 11:08.042
All right, all right.
Don't yell, don't yell."

11:08.125 --> 11:11.754
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

11:13.381 --> 11:15.049
Whereas I think
the Christian relationship

11:15.132 --> 11:17.551
is more like... (WHIMPERS)

11:17.635 --> 11:22.431
- So...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

11:23.849 --> 11:24.767
But there's not a racket.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.228
I don't see the Jew thing
as a racket.

11:27.311 --> 11:28.729
The Christian thing
I see as a racket.

11:28.813 --> 11:29.772
It's almost like, you know,

11:29.855 --> 11:31.690
"Here's the New Testament,
make it your own

11:31.774 --> 11:35.528
- and grift as you will."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

11:35.611 --> 11:38.864
Right? I mean,
and there's a pitch to it.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.074
that's kinda genius.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.701
And if you really break it down,
the pitch is basically,

11:42.785 --> 11:45.329
"Everything will be amazing

11:45.413 --> 11:48.707
- when you're dead."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

11:48.791 --> 11:52.753
- "Put some money in the jar."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

11:55.673 --> 11:59.343
But, look, the real problem
right now with, uh, you know...

12:00.386 --> 12:03.973
- Christian fascism...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12:04.056 --> 12:07.685
...is that, you know,
Roe v. Wade was taken down.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.645
Women, all women
in this country have lost

12:09.728 --> 12:11.188
their physical autonomy
and their rights

12:11.272 --> 12:12.648
and the weird thing is,

12:12.731 --> 12:13.941
I don't hear men
talking about it.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.943
I hear no men talking about it.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.987
Which is unusual to me
because if you're a guy

12:18.070 --> 12:19.155
with any game at all,

12:19.238 --> 12:20.948
you've paid
for at least two of those.

12:21.031 --> 12:25.494
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

12:25.578 --> 12:29.206
So you had something to say
at some point in time.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.126
I think most men are pro-choice,
usually desperately.

12:32.209 --> 12:33.586
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12:33.669 --> 12:35.337
"Baby, it's up to you.
It's your choice,

12:35.421 --> 12:38.382
- but not a great time, right?"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12:38.466 --> 12:40.885
"I mean, for either of us,
it's just not a good time.

12:40.968 --> 12:44.430
I mean, fuck, right? Fuck!

12:44.513 --> 12:47.475
No, I'm not mad at you,
it's just my whole fucking life!

12:47.558 --> 12:49.852
I'm not crying,
just do what you want!

12:53.981 --> 12:55.608
I'll pay for it.
I'll drive you down there.

12:55.691 --> 12:56.734
I'll take you to the place.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.195
We can get pancakes
at that place you like."

12:59.278 --> 13:02.656
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

13:02.740 --> 13:04.033
Or the entertainer's version,

13:04.116 --> 13:06.494
"I'll fly back into town,
just tell me the day!"

13:06.577 --> 13:08.913
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

13:12.166 --> 13:16.337
It's hard to talk to people
of faith about abortion

13:16.420 --> 13:18.589
if they have
the whole murder frame in place.

13:18.672 --> 13:21.133
If it's murder to somebody,
there's really no conversation.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.469
There's no way to bridge it.
You can't do the, like,

13:23.552 --> 13:27.139
"No, it's just cluster of cells,
not unlike a tumor. It's just...

13:27.223 --> 13:28.599
going a different direction,
you know?"

13:28.682 --> 13:30.976
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

13:33.354 --> 13:35.689
(CHUCKLES)
"With the same result sometimes,

13:35.773 --> 13:37.483
it's just a longer game,
really."

13:37.566 --> 13:39.985
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

13:43.447 --> 13:45.866
But a lot of it has to do
with the language of choice

13:45.950 --> 13:49.161
which is...
it's practical, it's medical.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.121
You know,
abortion, abortion clinic.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.499
Easy to demonize, scary.

13:53.582 --> 13:54.917
Like, if we shifted
some of the language,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.796
we might be able to bridge
a gap and have a conversation

13:58.879 --> 14:00.130
with people of faith.
Maybe just--

14:00.214 --> 14:02.383
Maybe we call them
angel factories.

14:02.466 --> 14:08.514
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

14:10.474 --> 14:13.811
I mean, that would be at least
a conversation starter, right?

14:13.894 --> 14:15.646
I didn't-- I don't--
I didn't say abortion clinic.

14:15.729 --> 14:17.731
I said an angel factory.

14:17.815 --> 14:20.359
And how if the concern
is getting souls to heaven,

14:20.442 --> 14:22.444
we need more of them,
we need more.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.029
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

14:24.947 --> 14:25.948
Now...

14:27.074 --> 14:28.367
Christians have corrected me
on this.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.577
One guy who wrote me an email.

14:29.660 --> 14:33.163
It was a fairly heady email.
It had two levels to it.

14:33.247 --> 14:37.459
The first level was, "The number
of angels is finite."

14:37.543 --> 14:40.963
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

14:41.046 --> 14:44.633
"Dead children do not become
angels, they're separate things.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.970
There's only a given number
of angels, good and bad.

14:48.053 --> 14:51.807
- So you were wrong there."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

14:56.729 --> 14:57.730
And the other thing was,

14:57.813 --> 14:59.732
"If a soul needs--
is gonna go to heaven,

14:59.815 --> 15:01.567
it needs to be baptized."
So, I'm like,

15:01.650 --> 15:03.402
"All right,
well there's-- That's--

15:03.485 --> 15:04.945
We can troubleshoot
around that."

15:05.029 --> 15:07.865
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- Right?

15:07.948 --> 15:11.577
I mean, there's a lot of priests
around with a lot of free time,

15:11.660 --> 15:13.787
and historically,
that's not a great thing.

15:13.871 --> 15:17.833
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

15:17.916 --> 15:20.836
But I say get the priests out
in front of the angel factories

15:20.919 --> 15:24.506
with the water and the,
whatever the kind of Latin hokum

15:24.590 --> 15:27.301
they need to do
the little dance around.

15:27.384 --> 15:30.846
And just do it for each woman
coming in and then, boom!

15:30.929 --> 15:35.017
Guaranteed soul
right up to heaven, every time.

15:35.100 --> 15:39.188
And I think that the vibe
outside an angel factory

15:39.271 --> 15:42.691
with the Christians hanging out
will be different than those

15:42.775 --> 15:45.152
at the abortion clinic.
I think it'd be more festive.

15:45.235 --> 15:48.739
- Just like...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

15:52.910 --> 15:54.912
Just standing around
watching the counter

15:54.995 --> 15:56.163
on the side of the building.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.168
Maybe there's a bell
on top of it.

16:01.251 --> 16:05.297
Bing! "Hallelujah! Praise Jesus.

16:05.381 --> 16:09.593
When the bell rings,
an angel gets its wings.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.096
We are blessed today.
We are blessed.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.430
Thank you, lady.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.641
Put a little money in the jar.
You're not off the hook."

16:15.724 --> 16:17.810
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

16:20.187 --> 16:22.398
(CLICKS TONGUE) So, okay.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.858
I know it's a lot
to get through,

16:24.942 --> 16:28.028
- especially from a Jew.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

16:28.112 --> 16:30.531
(CHUCKLES)
I don't know why I do this.

16:30.614 --> 16:34.201
I don't know why every show,
there's part of me,

16:34.284 --> 16:37.454
that just wants to keep poking
the Jew thing...

16:37.538 --> 16:38.789
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

16:38.872 --> 16:41.542
...just so people who think
they don't have anything

16:41.625 --> 16:44.461
against Jews,
under their breath says,

16:44.545 --> 16:49.216
- "We fucking get it, man."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

16:51.427 --> 16:56.598
(CHUCKLES) I just want you
to find that part of you.

16:59.601 --> 17:03.230
(SIGHS) All right.
So... (CHUCKLES)

17:05.149 --> 17:07.735
...I'm getting old.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.654
I'm 59. It's not really old,
but it's ol-- I'm in a--

17:10.738 --> 17:13.407
- (AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
- Yeah, whatever. I'm in a...

17:13.490 --> 17:19.288
It's no victory.
(CHUCKLES) Just luck.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.832
So-- But it's weird,
you get to a certain age

17:21.915 --> 17:23.751
where like,
like almost every night,

17:23.834 --> 17:26.420
right before I go to sleep,
I'm like, "Is this it?"

17:26.503 --> 17:28.922
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

17:29.006 --> 17:30.507
Right? And then the next thought
is always like,

17:30.591 --> 17:34.970
"I gotta get rid of some shit."
(CHUCKLES)

17:35.888 --> 17:37.639
"I got too much shit, man."

17:38.974 --> 17:40.559
But I don't always know
that I'm getting older.

17:40.642 --> 17:41.977
I don't always feel it
because I think

17:42.060 --> 17:44.188
it's a few reasons,
'cause I don't have kids.

17:44.271 --> 17:45.272
I think if you have kids,

17:45.355 --> 17:47.733
you can kinda see
you're dying in your kids.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.985
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

17:50.068 --> 17:51.737
I mean, maybe that's cynical
and I don't really know,

17:51.820 --> 17:52.946
but I have to imagine

17:53.030 --> 17:55.073
at some point you're like,
"Happy birthday, son.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.825
How old are you today?
Seventeen?

17:56.909 --> 17:59.578
- Fuck, I'm dying."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

17:59.661 --> 18:01.121
"I'm sorry. I meant
to say have fun today.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.999
I don't know. I guess
I was thinking out loud

18:04.082 --> 18:05.209
a little bit."

18:08.295 --> 18:09.338
Mirrors don't really help.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.465
I mean, they do,
but that you can't trust them.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.133
You have a relationship
with your mirror.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.885
It's the same thing
you look at every day.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.845
You have a codependent
relationship with the mirror

18:16.929 --> 18:19.473
that you look in every day
where you gaslight yourself

18:19.556 --> 18:22.935
into believing
that you're hanging in there.

18:23.018 --> 18:26.271
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

18:26.355 --> 18:27.523
I don't know
what your ritual is,

18:27.606 --> 18:29.691
but it's probably something
along the lines of...

18:35.405 --> 18:41.620
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

18:42.955 --> 18:44.581
And then you walk out
into the world

18:44.665 --> 18:46.792
totally deluded...

18:46.875 --> 18:49.336
that you look
the age you think you look.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.297
The only time I know
how I'm getting old,

18:52.381 --> 18:53.257
or that I am getting old,

18:53.340 --> 18:54.508
is when I look
at pictures of myself.

18:54.591 --> 18:55.592
Then it's-- It's somehow,

18:55.676 --> 18:57.553
it's clearer to me
'cause it's separate.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.846
And I look at pictures
and I'm like,

18:58.929 --> 19:01.598
"Oh, my God,
look at my old head!

19:01.682 --> 19:03.225
Look at my old, big head!

19:03.308 --> 19:06.061
When did my head
get big and old?"

19:06.144 --> 19:07.896
And it did,
and there's nothing you can do

19:07.980 --> 19:09.231
under your head

19:09.314 --> 19:11.775
that's gonna diminish
from your old head.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.027
No matter how you dress.
Everyone--

19:14.111 --> 19:15.696
People are gonna be like,
"Cool boots,

19:15.779 --> 19:18.866
- old head though, right?"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

19:18.949 --> 19:22.244
"Yes, it is an old head.
It's an old, honest head.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.454
I do nothing to it."

19:24.538 --> 19:25.873
I can't dye my hair.
Who the hell--

19:25.956 --> 19:28.041
How can you dye
your hair in your mid fifties

19:28.125 --> 19:30.502
as a dude and just--
What, you just expect everyone

19:30.586 --> 19:33.046
in your life to play along
with that decision, like...

19:33.130 --> 19:36.842
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

19:36.925 --> 19:39.136
You just show up one day
and everyone's like, "Oh, fuck,

19:39.219 --> 19:42.180
- I guess that's who he is now."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

19:42.264 --> 19:44.099
"What do you think, man?
You think-- Does it look good?"

19:44.182 --> 19:45.726
I'm like, "What are you
going for, Dracula?

19:45.809 --> 19:48.312
If you're going for Dracula,
you nailed it."

19:48.395 --> 19:49.479
"I did it myself."
"I can tell,

19:49.563 --> 19:52.774
- you dyed your scalp."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

19:52.858 --> 19:54.818
Think it's a little late
to go through a goth period,

19:54.902 --> 19:56.236
don't you? Am I wrong?

20:01.241 --> 20:02.993
And I think about what kind
of old guy I'm gonna be.

20:03.076 --> 20:05.412
I don't know, like,
you know, I'm approaching it,

20:05.495 --> 20:07.581
but, like, I know guys
in their eighties.

20:07.664 --> 20:08.832
Like, and I've decided that

20:08.916 --> 20:11.877
there's like two kinds
of old guys in their eighties.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.086
Like, there's the kinda guy

20:13.170 --> 20:14.838
that no matter
what kinda life he had,

20:14.922 --> 20:16.089
you know,
he's got some humility,

20:16.173 --> 20:17.799
he knows where he's at
in his life.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.010
You know, he's got
a certain amount of acceptance,

20:20.093 --> 20:21.470
you know, the kinda guy
that's like,

20:21.553 --> 20:22.512
"Yeah, you know, life was hard,

20:22.596 --> 20:24.139
but, you know,
it was up and down.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.016
But I'm just happy
to have another day.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.268
I'm grateful,
and I'm just gonna sit here

20:28.352 --> 20:30.562
and watch the water."

20:30.646 --> 20:34.316
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

20:34.399 --> 20:36.568
Right? That guy.

20:36.652 --> 20:37.986
And then there's
the other guy in his eighties

20:38.070 --> 20:39.529
that no matter
what kind of life he had,

20:39.613 --> 20:41.406
in his mind,
he got fucked somehow.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.616
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

20:42.699 --> 20:45.327
"The whole thing was bullshit.
It was all bullshit.

20:45.410 --> 20:49.247
No money left. No fucking money.
Two ex-wives. No money.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.624
One of my kids
doesn't talk to me.

20:50.707 --> 20:54.336
- The one that does is a moron."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

20:54.419 --> 20:56.380
"Fuck the whole thing,
it was bullshit.

20:56.463 --> 20:58.465
Just gonna sit here
and watch this asshole,

20:58.548 --> 20:59.675
watch the water."

20:59.758 --> 21:02.094
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

21:02.177 --> 21:04.846
"My best friend here,
the water watcher.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.390
Not mad at this guy."

21:06.473 --> 21:07.975
"Not today, you're not,
but yesterday--"

21:08.058 --> 21:11.603
- "Shut up. Don't talk."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

21:13.814 --> 21:15.440
MARC MARON:
I have old guys in my life.

21:15.524 --> 21:19.236
My dad's still alive.
My dad is 84 years old.

21:19.319 --> 21:20.612
- Don't. No. Don't.
- (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

21:20.696 --> 21:22.572
I get-- Don't.
Hold your applause...

21:22.656 --> 21:24.324
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

21:24.408 --> 21:26.159
...'cause I have to preface
this material by...

21:26.243 --> 21:28.203
with some honesty.
My-- For most of my life,

21:28.286 --> 21:30.664
my father
was very self-centered.

21:30.747 --> 21:31.665
He had bipolar,

21:31.748 --> 21:33.709
emotionally abusive,
narcissistic fuck.

21:33.792 --> 21:37.379
Now, the only reason
I'm telling you that

21:37.462 --> 21:38.714
is because
I don't want you to have

21:38.797 --> 21:43.468
- the wrong amount of empathy...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

21:43.552 --> 21:45.137
...when I do
these next few jokes.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.555
I don't want you,

21:46.638 --> 21:48.765
I don't want you rooting
for the wrong guy.

21:48.849 --> 21:54.312
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

21:54.396 --> 21:55.272
My father's 84,

21:55.355 --> 21:56.523
recently diagnosed
with dementia.

21:56.606 --> 21:59.526
- We're all pretty excited.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

22:03.196 --> 22:06.616
Everyone's dealing with this,
everyone's dealing with this.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.327
And I gotta be honest with you,
he's right at the beginning,

22:09.411 --> 22:11.371
so he's still got
almost all his old memories.

22:11.455 --> 22:15.333
Day of stuff's a little tricky.
But to be honest,

22:15.417 --> 22:17.294
he's very pleasant
to be around right now.

22:17.377 --> 22:20.964
He's open,
he's kinda funny. He's warm.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.466
Look, I guess
what I'm saying is,

22:22.549 --> 22:25.927
I know it's a terrible disease,
but don't miss the sweet spot.

22:26.011 --> 22:29.473
- It's...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

22:29.556 --> 22:30.766
...I think it's right
at the beginning.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.435
It's just lovely.
It really is just lovely.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.731
I'll just walk up to him
and be like,

22:37.814 --> 22:39.483
"How you doing, Dad?
How you doing?"

22:39.566 --> 22:40.942
I rub his little head.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.652
People get uncomfortable

22:42.736 --> 22:44.237
when they think of me
rubbing my dad's head.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.697
What am I supposed to be doing?

22:45.781 --> 22:49.076
- "What's my name?"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

22:49.159 --> 22:51.870
"Where do you live?
Do you know where you live?

22:53.288 --> 22:55.123
What day is today?"

22:58.668 --> 23:01.963
That's what they've earned at 84
is for you to selfishly

23:02.047 --> 23:04.758
yell at them thinking it helps

23:04.841 --> 23:07.469
as they look at you
confused and crying.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.433
But I'm showing up for him,
which is interesting, you know,

23:13.517 --> 23:15.268
because we did
have a difficult relationship

23:15.352 --> 23:21.108
and it's kinda nice
to live to be my age

23:21.191 --> 23:22.567
and have your parents alive,

23:22.651 --> 23:24.236
because, look, I'm one
of those people.

23:24.319 --> 23:27.948
I have a hard time
when people my age say,

23:28.031 --> 23:29.449
"Aren't you a little old

23:29.533 --> 23:31.743
to still be mad
at your parents?"

23:33.703 --> 23:37.040
- "No."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

23:39.126 --> 23:42.295
- "They did it."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

23:42.379 --> 23:48.343
(APPLAUDING, CHEERING)

23:48.426 --> 23:50.178
(CHUCKLES) I love my audience

23:50.262 --> 23:51.847
because I just know
there's a room full of people

23:51.930 --> 23:54.724
that were-- They only
had maybe one good parent.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.351
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

23:56.434 --> 24:00.772
Maybe. So it's a big room
full of broken toys in here.

24:00.856 --> 24:04.025
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
- (CHUCKLES)

24:04.109 --> 24:07.779
Every day is a fucking challenge
and you're overly sensitive

24:07.863 --> 24:10.699
and just... (CHUCKLES)
...battling dread all the time

24:10.782 --> 24:12.826
and wondering
if you're talented.

24:12.909 --> 24:14.578
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- So...

24:16.913 --> 24:19.207
So, my dad, so, he's like--
Okay, so, here's the thing.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.002
I'm like, I'm showing up
for the guy, like I said before.

24:22.085 --> 24:25.505
And it is weird,
but something gives way,

24:25.589 --> 24:26.882
no matter how difficult

24:26.965 --> 24:30.343
the relationship was between you
and that parent or both of them.

24:30.427 --> 24:32.304
Like, you get old enough,
and, you know, in your mind,

24:32.387 --> 24:34.514
you're sort of like,
"I kind of won."

24:34.598 --> 24:38.852
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

24:38.935 --> 24:41.146
So, I'm gonna go out there,
you know?

24:41.229 --> 24:42.647
But I go out there
to hang out with him.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.858
You know, the dementia
is new to him, it's new to me.

24:44.941 --> 24:47.360
I don't know his life that well.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.820
And I'll take him out
to this Chinese place.

24:48.904 --> 24:50.030
The last time I was there,

24:50.113 --> 24:53.283
we go to the Chinese place
and I order, you know,

24:53.366 --> 24:55.118
soup and some entrées.

24:55.202 --> 24:56.620
And we're just sitting there,
me and my dad,

24:56.703 --> 24:57.621
just sitting there,

24:57.704 --> 24:59.539
and he just picks up
his soup spoon

24:59.623 --> 25:03.084
- and he fills it with soy sauce.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

25:03.168 --> 25:08.757
And he's looking right at me,
right in my face. (SLURPS)

25:08.840 --> 25:11.760
And he just sucks the spoonful
of soy sauce down.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.595
And my only thought
in that moment was,

25:13.678 --> 25:15.222
"I didn't know my dad did that."

25:15.305 --> 25:20.352
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

25:20.435 --> 25:21.519
"I really haven't gone out
to Chinese

25:21.603 --> 25:22.771
with him
in a long time, I guess."

25:22.854 --> 25:25.649
You know. That's wild.
Right out of the spoon.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.986
Yeah, I watched him fill it
up again. He filled it up again.

25:30.904 --> 25:34.950
He's looking right at me.
(SLURPS)

25:35.033 --> 25:37.994
And I said, "Is that good?"
And he said, "I like it."

25:38.078 --> 25:42.540
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

25:42.624 --> 25:45.126
He did it three times...

25:45.210 --> 25:47.879
before my brain was like,
"He has dementia.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.757
Take the spoon away from him,

25:50.840 --> 25:54.219
or he'll drink all the soy sauce
one spoonful at a time."

25:58.473 --> 25:59.391
So I put the spoon down.

25:59.474 --> 26:00.600
"Dad, we're gonna
have food coming."

26:00.684 --> 26:02.435
And he's like, "All right.
Now, there he is."

26:02.519 --> 26:04.271
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

26:04.354 --> 26:05.563
Every time I do that
to his head,

26:05.647 --> 26:07.399
he's like... (CHUCKLES)

26:07.482 --> 26:10.235
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

26:15.365 --> 26:16.700
And, look, I know. (SIGHS)

26:16.783 --> 26:19.244
I know it's a terrible disease
and...

26:20.412 --> 26:22.122
you know, and at some point,
he's--

26:22.205 --> 26:24.249
he's not going to know
who I am anymore. I know that.

26:24.332 --> 26:28.545
(CLICKS TONGUE) And I also know,
on that day,

26:28.628 --> 26:32.590
- I will be truly free.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

26:35.427 --> 26:38.054
"Hey, Dad, how you feeling?"
"Who the fuck are you?"

26:38.138 --> 26:41.349
- "Yes! It's over."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

26:41.433 --> 26:42.684
"The most toxic relationship

26:42.767 --> 26:45.687
of my life just ended, buddy,
just ended."

26:45.770 --> 26:47.439
"Who the fuck are you?"
"Doesn't matter.

26:47.522 --> 26:51.318
Doesn't matter. I thought
I knew you. My bad. My bad."

26:52.360 --> 26:54.779
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- (CHUCKLES)

26:56.323 --> 26:58.825
So I have this other old man
in my life.

26:58.908 --> 27:00.327
My mother is still alive.
But I can't--

27:00.410 --> 27:02.078
I'm going to go easy on her
because she's still,

27:02.162 --> 27:06.666
- you know, cognizant.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

27:06.750 --> 27:08.001
It's not great.

27:09.085 --> 27:10.211
But she's got this boyfriend.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.547
Do you still call him
a boyfriend when they're 85?

27:12.630 --> 27:14.549
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

27:14.632 --> 27:18.428
The guy who's fucking my mother
is 85 years old and...

27:20.597 --> 27:22.891
I should be nothing but grateful
that he's fucking my mother.

27:22.974 --> 27:27.020
I should thank God every day
that John is fucking my mother.

27:27.103 --> 27:30.023
Right. It's great.
Takes a load off of me.

27:30.106 --> 27:33.568
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

27:33.651 --> 27:38.323
- In a metaphorical way.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

27:41.284 --> 27:42.327
But John's difficult.

27:42.410 --> 27:43.870
And it's not
'cause he's fucking my mother.

27:43.953 --> 27:47.999
I mean, like, I'm 59. He's 85.
Is there a point

27:48.083 --> 27:49.667
where you grow past
that sort of like,

27:49.751 --> 27:51.461
"Why are you
fucking this guy, Ma?"

27:51.544 --> 27:54.672
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

27:56.549 --> 27:57.842
But they've been together
a long time.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.053
He's just annoying, you know?
And I try to be tolerant.

28:00.136 --> 28:02.555
But he's one of these old guys
that, you know... (CHUCKLES)

28:02.639 --> 28:04.849
He just talks. He talks a lot.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.477
He thinks he's telling stories,
but he's not really.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.646
They don't go anywhere.
They don't land.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.356
You don't even know
they're over,

28:11.439 --> 28:14.067
you know,
until he wistfully says,

28:14.150 --> 28:15.902
"It was a different time."
You know?

28:15.985 --> 28:18.947
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- And it's annoying, you know?

28:19.030 --> 28:20.615
Like, I'll go over there
and he'll be like,

28:20.698 --> 28:22.867
"Marc. Marc, come here.
Let me tell you something."

28:22.951 --> 28:26.830
"What?" "Listen." "Okay?"
"When I was younger,

28:26.913 --> 28:28.248
we used to go
to the delicatessen,

28:28.331 --> 28:32.919
maybe have a sandwich,
some coffee, talk a little bit.

28:33.002 --> 28:36.673
- It was a different time."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

28:36.756 --> 28:39.467
"Is that the whole thing?
That's the whole story?"

28:39.551 --> 28:41.594
"Why you got to be a wiseass?"
"It's just not a story.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.763
I mean, there was probably
a story in there.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.348
You know, what deli?
Who were you talking to?

28:45.432 --> 28:47.809
What kind of sandwich?
A lot of options.

28:47.892 --> 28:51.020
- You chose none of them. Zero."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

28:52.397 --> 28:54.899
"I can't talk to you." "Good.
Don't fucking talk to me or..."

"What? What is it?"

29:09.497 --> 29:12.792
"Listen." "Okay?"
"When I was younger."

29:13.168 --> 29:14.169
"Yeah?"

"We used to go out
maybe on a Saturday night

29:16.421 --> 29:19.132
with the ladies, to a show.

there was a story in there?

What show? What ladies?
What year?

29:37.025 --> 29:39.986
The type of shoe
would be a nice detail."

29:40.069 --> 29:41.821
"Maybe that's just me."
"I can't talk to you."

29:41.905 --> 29:45.658
"Good. Don't fucking talk to me.
Do me a favor."

You're kind of an amazing poet.

I was trying to make

30:50.014 --> 30:51.099
is that the mortality thing,

the idea of impending death,
which is, you know,

30:54.644 --> 30:59.023
pretty much going to happen.
To everyone.

30:59.816 --> 31:02.110
It's right there.

31:02.193 --> 31:05.780
And I know a lot of you know me
and you know my life

31:05.863 --> 31:07.156
'cause you listen to me
all the time.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.617
And you know that during COVID,
my partner, my girlfriend,

31:09.701 --> 31:12.829
Lynn Shelton, the director,
the genius passed away.

31:12.912 --> 31:13.830

31:16.374 --> 31:20.295

So... (SHUSHES) Take it easy.

31:29.095 --> 31:31.306
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- It'll be okay.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.516
I can get right back
into the sad tone.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.104
But she did. She passed away.

31:38.187 --> 31:39.314
And it was the most
horrible thing

31:39.397 --> 31:41.899
that's ever happened to me.
And I'm sure to her.

31:41.983 --> 31:45.028
- And...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

31:50.116 --> 31:51.367
It was right there.

31:53.786 --> 31:57.123
But let me get serious.
You know, she did die

31:57.206 --> 32:01.002
and it was a terrible tragedy.
And the truth is, like,

32:01.085 --> 32:02.587
I'm a guy
who talks about his life.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.964
So I wasn't clear
how that was gonna go.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.466
How am I going
to talk about that?

32:06.549 --> 32:07.842
You know, "Is that ever
going to happen?

32:07.925 --> 32:10.678
Is there a way to bring
humor to that?"

32:10.762 --> 32:12.680
Because I'm not really
the kind of guy

32:12.764 --> 32:14.557
that's like, "She's dead,
what are the bits?

32:14.641 --> 32:16.684
- Let's get going." You know?
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

32:16.768 --> 32:19.103
But there was also moments
where I'm like,

32:19.187 --> 32:20.188
"Well, maybe I can't do it.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.981
Maybe I have to do something
more serious.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.942
Maybe I have to do maybe
a Jewish themed one-man show,

32:25.026 --> 32:27.403
you know, maybe, like,
<i>Marc Maron's Kaddish:</i>

32:27.487 --> 32:30.490
<i>A Prayer for the Dead,"</i>
you know,

32:30.573 --> 32:33.660
sort of a black box theater.
You know, before the show,

32:33.743 --> 32:39.207
there's like Israeli music
playing, you know. (VOCALIZES)

32:39.290 --> 32:41.292
And then the lights come up
and I just lean into it.

32:44.837 --> 32:48.800

32:48.883 --> 32:50.218
People would walk out
of that show going,

32:50.301 --> 32:53.221
"Definitely wasn't funny,
wasn't funny at all.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.598
And I like him. He's funny.
But this was very sad.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.058
But I'm glad he did it.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.976
He seemed to, like, really work
through some stuff.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.062
But not one laugh.
Not one laugh.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.063
And I'm not Jewish,

33:02.146 --> 33:04.023

the references."

33:04.107 --> 33:08.653
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

33:08.736 --> 33:10.530
But then I thought, "Well,
maybe how about a TED talk?

33:10.613 --> 33:12.115
People do TED talks.
I could do a TED talk.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.200
How hard is a fucking TED talk?
I just have to get one

33:14.283 --> 33:17.203
of those weird, you know,
earphone, microphones.

33:17.286 --> 33:19.372

33:32.969 --> 33:38.766
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

33:38.850 --> 33:40.309
But then, ultimately,
what happens is I realize,

33:40.393 --> 33:41.602
well, you're just going
to talk about it.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.937
You know, somehow or another,
you figured out

33:43.020 --> 33:44.647
you're gonna talk about it
and if, you know,

33:44.731 --> 33:46.524
you need to talk about it
in a funny way,

33:46.607 --> 33:47.525
it will happen at some point

33:47.608 --> 33:50.027
if it's necessary,
which it always is.

33:50.111 --> 33:52.405
But, like, I realize, you know,
and thinking about it that,

33:52.488 --> 33:54.449
you know, no one really talks
about grief.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.700
No one talks about PTSD.

33:55.783 --> 33:57.201
No one knows
how to process this stuff.

33:57.285 --> 34:00.747
Everybody has it. It's just,
you know, locked into us.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.165
And there's not a conversation.

34:02.248 --> 34:03.583
There's not really
a cultural conversation

34:03.666 --> 34:06.794
around it. And it's difficult.
You know, when she died,

34:06.878 --> 34:08.796
the only things that really
kind of stuck in my head

34:08.880 --> 34:11.257
was that I'm not the victim,
you know, she is.

34:11.340 --> 34:12.383
And it's horrible.

34:12.467 --> 34:15.052
And, you know,
this is not unusual.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.305
People die in people's lives.
Tragedy happens.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.556
You hope
it doesn't happen to you,

34:18.639 --> 34:20.767
but it happens
to probably most people.

34:20.850 --> 34:21.934
And then the Jewish thing,
you know,

34:22.018 --> 34:23.269
"May her memory be a blessing."

34:23.352 --> 34:25.313
These sort of,
you know, kept me going.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.815
And it was a difficult time
to grieve because it was COVID,

34:27.899 --> 34:29.942
so, you know,
no one could really come by.

34:30.026 --> 34:32.653
People reached out,
but there was not a lot of,

34:32.737 --> 34:34.322
you know, human contact,
and I guess--

34:34.405 --> 34:38.076
I'd be honest with you,
I got very tired of crying

34:38.159 --> 34:40.286
in front of strangers,
my neighbors.

34:40.369 --> 34:42.038
'Cause I didn't know them.
And it was in the paper.

34:42.121 --> 34:44.081
And this is how I met
my neighbors.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.208
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

34:45.291 --> 34:47.335
You know, and grief
is a fucked up thing.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.754
You know, I remember, like,
a week after she died,

34:49.837 --> 34:51.380
I was just taking
my garbage out

34:51.464 --> 34:54.342
and from across the street,
I hear, "Hey, Marc, I'm Troy.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.010
I live across the street.
How are you doing, man?"

34:56.094 --> 34:59.806
I'm like, "Not good, dude!
It's not good."

34:59.889 --> 35:01.682
He's like, "Yeah, I bet, buddy.
I bet."

35:01.766 --> 35:03.851
"It's fucking terrible."
"I bet, man.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.269
Well, I'm just
across the street."

35:05.353 --> 35:07.647
"I know, man. I see you.
You're right there."

35:07.730 --> 35:11.108
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

35:11.192 --> 35:13.986
And he just stood there
until I stopped crying.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.571
And I was like, "Thanks, man."

35:15.655 --> 35:18.074
That's-- I feel better, buddy.
I feel better."

35:18.157 --> 35:19.575
"Nice meeting you, dude."

35:21.118 --> 35:22.370
It was that moment
where I realized, like,

35:22.453 --> 35:24.664
it doesn't take much to show up
for somebody in grief.

35:24.747 --> 35:26.415
And a lot of us,
when it happens in our lives,

35:26.499 --> 35:28.084
you're like, "What do I do?
What do I say?"

35:28.167 --> 35:32.004
You don't have to say anything.
You barely have to show up.

35:32.088 --> 35:34.382
You don't even
have to invest emotionally.

35:34.465 --> 35:37.051
You just have to be like,
"How you doing?"

35:37.134 --> 35:39.846
Wait till they stop crying
and go like, "Okay."

35:39.929 --> 35:41.681

35:41.764 --> 35:43.057
you're the greatest person
in the world.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.309
Like, "You really showed up
for me when I was grieving."

35:45.393 --> 35:47.395
I'm like, "Really?
Oh, yeah. Okay."

35:47.478 --> 35:49.647
- So...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

35:51.023 --> 35:53.401
But it was just weird because,
you know, it was COVID.

35:53.484 --> 35:55.528
And, you know,
I just sit on my porch

35:55.611 --> 35:57.071
and people I knew
would come over

35:57.154 --> 35:59.490
and they stand in the yard,
you know, with their mask on.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.617
I felt like a zoo exhibit.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.870
There should've just been a sign
that said, "Grieving Man."

36:03.953 --> 36:06.873
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- And I would just sit there

36:06.956 --> 36:08.249
and people would show up,
they'd be like,

36:08.332 --> 36:10.418
"How are you doing?"
I'm like, "Not great."

36:10.501 --> 36:11.586
"We brought food."

36:11.669 --> 36:15.590
- "Slide it into the cage."

36:26.350 --> 36:29.604

You want to be helped.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.856
You want to feel better.
You want it to go away.

36:31.939 --> 36:34.358
But it doesn't,
because it happened.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.611
And you realize over time
that it'll never go away.

36:36.694 --> 36:40.197
But people want to help
and you want to feel better.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.407
If you have smart friends,

36:41.490 --> 36:44.201
you'll get, like, six copies
of the Joan Didion book.

36:44.285 --> 36:48.080
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

36:48.164 --> 36:49.457
It seems like there's a group
of people

36:49.540 --> 36:51.042
that as soon
as someone dies, man,

And you're like, "All right.
So her husband died, too.

37:00.801 --> 37:03.679
- Didn't really help me."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

37:03.763 --> 37:06.515
But if you're a creative person,
it adds another level of despair

37:06.599 --> 37:09.310
'cause you're like, "Fuck,
do I need to start writing now?"

they think
will make you feel better.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.110
like, I remember someone
told me,

37:18.194 --> 37:19.779
I can't remember who it was.

37:19.862 --> 37:22.073
They said, "Hey, man, you know,

37:22.156 --> 37:24.700
when people die,
they don't really leave.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.994
You know, their energy
is still here."

"How is that helpful?"

37:32.166 --> 37:34.377
"I got used to her
in a human form."

37:36.003 --> 37:37.797
And this person was like, "Yeah,
but just think about it, man,

37:37.880 --> 37:41.092
everyone who's ever died,
their energy is still here."

37:41.175 --> 37:45.012
- And I'm like, "Okay."

you'll go mystical.

after that guy told me that,

I'm just sitting on my porch

and a hummingbird came

Of course, you are.
That makes so much sense."

38:04.240 --> 38:08.911
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

38:08.995 --> 38:10.371
"I miss you, baby.
I can't believe

38:10.454 --> 38:13.749
you're a hummingbird.
What's that like? That's crazy."

38:17.962 --> 38:18.879
And then the next day

38:18.963 --> 38:20.047
there were, like,
four hummingbirds

38:20.131 --> 38:21.507
and I'm like,
"What the fuck is happening?"

38:21.590 --> 38:24.218
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

38:24.301 --> 38:26.887
"Which one is Lynn? Who's Lynn?

38:26.971 --> 38:28.806
Is this, like, Lynn
and her new dead friends?

38:28.889 --> 38:31.350
This is what happens
when people die.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.185
They just become birds
of one kind or another.

38:33.269 --> 38:35.271
That's going to disappoint
some Christians."

38:35.354 --> 38:39.692
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- (MARC CLICKS TONGUE, CHUCKLES)

38:39.775 --> 38:44.739
"Everything will be amazing
when you're a bird."

38:46.198 --> 38:48.200
(CHUCKLES)

38:48.284 --> 38:52.788
- "Put the money in the jar."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

38:52.872 --> 38:55.458
But the bird thing kind of stuck
because, like, at some point,

38:55.541 --> 38:58.085
like, a bird, you know,
built a nest right above

38:58.169 --> 39:01.088
where I walk into my house
and they just shit so much.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.673
It's, like, astounding.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.467
If you really just take a minute
to think, like,

39:04.550 --> 39:07.428
"How much do birds shit?"
It's a lot.

39:07.511 --> 39:10.264
And I have to be careful
walking into my house

39:10.347 --> 39:12.558
because the bird was shitting,
and at some point I said,

39:12.641 --> 39:14.351
"Hey, baby,
I'm not going to forget you.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.812
- Is there a different way..."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

39:18.522 --> 39:19.565
"...that we can do this?
You know,

39:19.648 --> 39:22.068
I still have the hat and stuff,
and...

39:22.151 --> 39:24.445
the shit thing's kind of tired,
I think."

39:24.528 --> 39:28.574
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

39:28.657 --> 39:31.410
But, look, I miss her
and it's weird

39:31.494 --> 39:33.788
when you lose somebody
because it really, you know,

39:33.871 --> 39:36.123
it wakes you up to some...

39:36.207 --> 39:41.420
To who you are really,
and also how fragile life is.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.340
You know, maybe love
will happen again.

39:44.423 --> 39:45.966
I don't know.
I'm not that great at it.

39:46.050 --> 39:49.720
I just... (CHUCKLES) I come
from very selfish stock,

39:49.804 --> 39:52.681
and I don't have the tools
necessary

39:52.765 --> 39:55.267
to really be as open
as I'd like.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.144
But who knows? It might happen.
I might find love again.

39:57.228 --> 40:00.773
And maybe I'll be sleeping
with a person I love,

40:00.856 --> 40:03.442
having love sex as opposed
to the other kind.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.028
- Equally as good.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

40:06.821 --> 40:07.947
But maybe I'm having love sex

40:08.030 --> 40:10.324
and, you know, it's beautiful
and the woman

40:10.407 --> 40:12.201
I'm having sex with

40:12.284 --> 40:13.953
kind of looks over my shoulder
and she says,

40:14.036 --> 40:16.122
"Why is that hummingbird
just hovering out there?"

40:16.205 --> 40:19.208
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

40:19.291 --> 40:20.543
I'm like, "Yeah,
that's my old girlfriend.

40:20.626 --> 40:22.461
She just-- I don't know.

40:22.545 --> 40:24.171
She just likes
to be part of it sometimes."

40:24.255 --> 40:26.507
"You cool with that?"
"Is she with her friends?"

40:26.590 --> 40:28.134
"Usually there's
four of them and...

40:29.260 --> 40:30.845
it's fucking out of control."

40:34.807 --> 40:36.684
I did wonder, like,

40:36.767 --> 40:39.812
would I ever be able
to be funny about things?

40:39.895 --> 40:41.355
But I find that, like, you know,

40:41.438 --> 40:42.982
humor that comes
from real darkness

40:43.065 --> 40:44.817
is really the best
because it disarms it.

40:44.900 --> 40:47.403
It's elevating to the spirit.
It's why I got into comedy,

40:47.486 --> 40:49.822
because I would watch comics
and they would take things

40:49.905 --> 40:53.159
that were complicated
or horrifying and simplify them

40:53.242 --> 40:55.369
and sort of make you see them
in a different way

40:55.452 --> 40:57.204
and have a laugh.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.040
And I think
it's a beautiful thing.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.085
And necessary, like,
I believe there was probably,

41:03.169 --> 41:05.629
some hilarious people
in Auschwitz.

41:05.713 --> 41:09.884
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

41:09.967 --> 41:11.469
I mean, come on.
It was, like, all Jews.

41:11.552 --> 41:14.221
- Are you going to tell me...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

41:14.305 --> 41:16.182
...are you going to tell me
there wasn't one guy

41:16.265 --> 41:17.308
where the other Jews are like,

41:17.391 --> 41:18.726
"Are you going
to watch Murray tonight?

41:18.809 --> 41:21.228
It's crazy. He's hilarious.
He does all the Nazis.

41:21.312 --> 41:24.315
- It's hilarious."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

41:26.233 --> 41:28.152
Of course, there was.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.238
I'm sure there's, like,
an Auschwitz joke book

41:31.322 --> 41:35.117
written by Jews that no one
knows how to publish.

41:35.201 --> 41:38.120
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

41:39.121 --> 41:40.289
"What are we going to call it?

41:40.372 --> 41:41.957
<i>The Auschwitz Joke Book</i>
<i>by Jews."</i>

41:42.041 --> 41:45.211
- "It's not happening. We can't."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

41:45.294 --> 41:47.129
"It'll be misunderstood.
We can't."

41:51.258 --> 41:54.595
But I do remember the first,
you know, joke that came to me

41:54.678 --> 41:57.890
about Lynn's passing
that made me feel better.

41:59.183 --> 42:02.269
And I'll share it with you.
The setup is heavy.

42:02.353 --> 42:05.940
And if you're-- if...

42:06.023 --> 42:08.192
The fact that you're going
to die is triggering to you,

42:08.275 --> 42:09.985
you might want to leave
for a few minutes.

42:10.069 --> 42:13.697
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- All right. So...

42:15.282 --> 42:16.909
this is a day that a lot
of people have had.

42:16.992 --> 42:18.077
It's when you have a loved one

42:18.160 --> 42:19.411
in the hospital
who's fighting for their life.

42:19.495 --> 42:21.747
It's a horrible day.
Don't wish it on anybody.

42:21.830 --> 42:23.582
It's the worst day of your life.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.417
You're on the phone
with doctors, with friends,

42:25.501 --> 42:27.711
with family members,
trying to hold on to hope,

42:27.795 --> 42:29.129
trying to get information,

42:29.213 --> 42:33.634
trying to figure out a way
to stay positive.

42:33.717 --> 42:37.263
You know, and at some point,
you know,

42:37.346 --> 42:39.014
it turns and it's not going
to work out

42:39.098 --> 42:41.517
the way that you want it
to work out.

42:42.685 --> 42:46.313
And about 5:30,
6:30 in the afternoon,

42:46.397 --> 42:47.856
you know, the doctor says to me,
he says,

42:47.940 --> 42:51.277
"Look, you can come down here
and see her if you want."

42:51.360 --> 42:53.779
This is peak COVID,
no one's in hospitals.

42:53.862 --> 42:56.073
"She's probably going
to be gone.

42:56.156 --> 42:57.658
We're taking her off
the machines,

42:57.741 --> 43:00.786
but you can come down here
and see her."

43:00.869 --> 43:02.079
And I was like... (EXHALES)

43:02.162 --> 43:05.791
"What? Do-- What do you mean?
Do people even do that?"

43:05.874 --> 43:07.251
And he's like,
"I don't know what people do.

43:07.334 --> 43:08.669
I'm just telling you
I can make that happen."

43:08.752 --> 43:10.045
I'm like, "I don't know.
I don't know.

43:10.129 --> 43:11.463
I don't know what to do.
I gotta, you know,

43:11.547 --> 43:14.717
I gotta call, like, 12 people
to figure out what to do."

43:14.800 --> 43:16.677
So I start calling people
and I'm like,

43:16.760 --> 43:19.179
"Dude, the doctor just said
that I can go see her

43:19.263 --> 43:20.222
and she's going to be dead."

43:20.306 --> 43:21.348
And they're like,
"That's fucked up."

43:21.432 --> 43:22.683
And I'm like,
"That's not helpful."

43:22.766 --> 43:24.184
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

43:24.268 --> 43:26.395
So I went through about nine
of those.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.440
And finally,
I called Michaela Watkins,

43:29.523 --> 43:32.067
who's a friend of both of ours,
great actress.

43:32.151 --> 43:33.319
And I go, "Michaela,
the doctor says

43:33.402 --> 43:35.029
I can come see her,
but she's going to be dead."

43:35.112 --> 43:37.072
And Michaela just goes,
"Oh, you have to do that."

43:37.156 --> 43:40.659
And I'm like, "I don't.
It sounds terrible."

43:40.743 --> 43:42.286
She goes, "You would regret
not doing that."

43:42.369 --> 43:43.871
And I thought, like,
"You don't really know me,

43:43.954 --> 43:47.124
apparently, because it sounds
like the worst thing

43:47.207 --> 43:49.710
I could ever do in my life."
And she said,

43:49.793 --> 43:51.545
"Well, it's never going
to happen again,

43:51.628 --> 43:54.048
and it might be good to do it

43:54.131 --> 43:55.382
because there's going
to be closure there

43:55.466 --> 43:57.051
and you don't really know
how it will feel.

43:57.134 --> 44:00.220
And it's an important thing
to do. It's an opportunity."

44:00.304 --> 44:05.392
And I'm like, "Oh, okay. Fuck."

44:05.476 --> 44:06.935
So I call the doctor back
and I'm like,

44:07.019 --> 44:08.937
"All right, I'm in,
I'm coming down."

44:09.021 --> 44:11.148
And he's like, "All right, well,
I gotta give you a heads up.

44:11.231 --> 44:12.483
We can't really clean up

44:12.566 --> 44:14.026
because the coroner
has to sign off on her."

44:14.109 --> 44:15.361
And I'm like,
"You're not really selling this.

44:15.444 --> 44:19.114
- I gotta be honest with you."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

44:20.115 --> 44:21.533
"I don't know
if I can handle it, man."

44:21.617 --> 44:23.202
He's like, "You can handle it.

44:23.285 --> 44:25.120
Just come down here
and we'll take care of you."

44:25.204 --> 44:28.207
And I'm like, "Oh, all right."
So, now, it's 12:30 at night,

44:28.290 --> 44:31.335
I'm driving down to the hospital
and I'm in shock.

44:31.418 --> 44:33.087
My girlfriend died.

44:33.170 --> 44:35.422
You know,
out of body experience.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.841
I'm shattered
and totally traumatized.

44:37.925 --> 44:39.426
And I'm driving alone

44:39.510 --> 44:41.470
to this hospital
in the middle of the night.

44:41.553 --> 44:43.847
And I get to the hospital
and there's no one in it,

44:43.931 --> 44:45.724
just a security guard. I'm like,
"I'm here."

44:45.808 --> 44:48.060
He says, "Yeah, I know."

44:48.143 --> 44:51.897
And he takes me up
to intensive care.

44:51.980 --> 44:53.023
Now, like, thank God for nurses.

44:53.107 --> 44:55.984
They're real heroes
and they're at this shit.

44:56.068 --> 44:58.737
- Yeah.
- (AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

44:58.821 --> 44:59.905
Every day.

45:01.156 --> 45:03.492
Every day, nurses are dealing
with this stuff.

45:03.575 --> 45:06.203
And I'm saying that to preface
the fact that the nurses

45:06.286 --> 45:07.871
up in the ICU
were a little chipper.

45:07.955 --> 45:10.999
- I don't know why. But...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

45:13.460 --> 45:14.628
Maybe it was helpful.
I don't know.

45:14.711 --> 45:16.463
But I got up there
and I'm like, "Hi."

45:16.547 --> 45:18.924
And they're like, "Hi!"
And I'm like, "Re-- Okay."

45:19.007 --> 45:23.512
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

45:23.595 --> 45:25.973
And I'm like, "You know,
I'm here to see Lynn Shelton."

45:26.056 --> 45:28.016
They're like, "We know,
she's just in there."

45:28.100 --> 45:30.102
And there's no rooms
in an ICU. Not at this one.

45:30.185 --> 45:32.104
It was dark
and there was just curtains.

45:32.187 --> 45:33.272
And they said, "She's in there.

45:33.355 --> 45:34.606
You know, you go in there
and, you know,

45:34.690 --> 45:37.943
take as much time as you want."
And I'm like, "Okay."

45:38.026 --> 45:40.737
So I walk in there
and Lynn's there and she's gone.

45:40.821 --> 45:43.157
And I was able to, you know,
touch her forehead

45:43.240 --> 45:45.409
and, you know, tell her
I loved her and cry,

45:45.492 --> 45:46.535
you know, for a few minutes.

45:46.618 --> 45:49.496
And I stayed with her
for a good five minutes,

45:49.580 --> 45:52.166
and I was like,
you know, I felt like,

45:52.249 --> 45:57.337
"Okay, I'm going to go,"
you know, and I said goodbye

45:57.421 --> 46:00.424
and I'm walking out
and I'm thinking,

46:00.507 --> 46:02.009
"Selfie? No. Right?"

46:02.092 --> 46:07.514
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

46:07.598 --> 46:08.891
(MARC MUMBLES)

46:13.103 --> 46:14.146
Now...

46:14.229 --> 46:18.108
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

46:20.068 --> 46:22.196
...when I wrote that joke

46:22.279 --> 46:24.823
or when I came up with it,
it made me feel so happy.

46:24.907 --> 46:27.367
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

46:27.451 --> 46:28.869
But I didn't know
what to do with it, you know,

46:28.952 --> 46:30.496
so I call the darkest comic
I know,

46:30.579 --> 46:32.164
Dan Vitale, who's since passed.

46:32.247 --> 46:34.958
And I said-- I told the joke.
And he's like,

46:35.042 --> 46:40.297
"Oh, my God, that's amazing.
But you can never tell that."

46:40.380 --> 46:42.382
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

46:42.466 --> 46:45.344
And I'm like,
"I don't know, man. We'll see."

46:45.427 --> 46:47.429
I think-- And I think Lynn
would like it,

46:47.513 --> 46:49.515
you know, and I held on
to that,

46:49.598 --> 46:51.767
you know, until I got
to Ireland recently.

46:51.850 --> 46:55.229
- And now, it's become unclear.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

46:55.312 --> 46:56.772
I was doing that bit in Ireland,

46:56.855 --> 46:59.733
and her and I
had a vacation there.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.193
It was the only vacation
we had taken

47:01.276 --> 47:04.363
and we had an amazing time.
We both had a deep sort of love

47:04.446 --> 47:07.366
for Ireland for whatever reason,
because it's amazing. But--

47:07.449 --> 47:09.743
So I'm in Dublin doing
a show recently

47:09.826 --> 47:10.994
and I do that bit

47:11.078 --> 47:13.914
and the lights in the venue
started going on and off.

47:13.997 --> 47:18.502
The lights on me
started wavering.

47:18.585 --> 47:21.171
And everyone in the room
was like, "Oh, my God."

47:21.255 --> 47:25.634
And I'm like, "Take it easy.
Hi, Lynn.

47:25.717 --> 47:29.763
I'm glad you're in Ireland
and you love it here. You good?"

47:29.846 --> 47:32.099
And then it was like, "Okay."
And I did--

47:32.182 --> 47:35.936
And I took it as a sign that,
"Okay, she likes the jokes."

47:36.019 --> 47:40.774
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
- Wait. But wait.

47:41.733 --> 47:43.986
So then I get back
to my hotel room

47:44.069 --> 47:46.613
and the venue manager said,
"That's never happened before."

47:46.697 --> 47:48.240
"No, it was Lynn,
she's hanging out."

47:48.323 --> 47:50.742
So-- "Usually she's a bird."

47:50.826 --> 47:54.371
- So...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

47:58.750 --> 48:01.211
But I get back to my hotel room
in Ireland and I go to turn

48:01.295 --> 48:03.547
the lamp on and the bulb goes...
(IMITATES CRACKLING)

48:03.630 --> 48:06.758
It just doesn't-- It goes out.
And I'm like,

48:06.842 --> 48:10.387
- "Shit. What's up, baby?"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

48:10.470 --> 48:11.972
But I'm still holding on
to the idea that,

48:12.055 --> 48:15.767
"No, she likes the jokes.
Right?"

48:15.851 --> 48:17.769
When you're sad,
you'll go mystical.

48:18.812 --> 48:22.691
So I do them in Texas
a few months later

48:22.774 --> 48:26.111
and during that bit
the mic starts going in and out

48:26.194 --> 48:28.655
and I'm like, "Oh, shit,
she came to Texas."

48:28.739 --> 48:32.117
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

48:32.200 --> 48:34.620
(CHUCKLES) "Maybe
she doesn't like the jokes."

48:34.703 --> 48:37.372
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

48:39.708 --> 48:41.835
But I thought if it happens
at the HBO taping,

48:41.918 --> 48:43.962
I'm definitely
never doing them again.

48:44.046 --> 48:50.677
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)

48:52.304 --> 48:53.305
But...

48:55.098 --> 48:58.143
Look. I-- She was, you know,
a big supporter of mine,

48:58.226 --> 49:01.688
and I loved her and I miss her.
So, rest in peace, Lynn Shelton.

49:01.772 --> 49:05.150
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

49:10.739 --> 49:12.240
You know, I'm--

49:12.324 --> 49:15.827
You know, I do try to focus
on gratitude to some degree

49:15.911 --> 49:19.206
when I can, and I have no kids.
And it's amazing.

49:19.289 --> 49:21.833
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

49:21.917 --> 49:24.586
It really is. It's--
I can't even begin to tell you,

49:24.670 --> 49:25.921
if you have them what--

49:26.004 --> 49:28.048
well, how amazing it would
have been if you didn't.

49:28.131 --> 49:32.177
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

49:33.261 --> 49:35.305
(CLICKS TONGUE)
And I think even ten years ago,

49:35.389 --> 49:37.516
a 59-year-old man on stage
saying he didn't have kids,

49:37.599 --> 49:38.809
a lot of people
would be like, "Aw,"

49:38.892 --> 49:41.103
but I think that paradigm
is shifting a little bit.

49:41.186 --> 49:42.354
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

49:42.437 --> 49:43.647
I think there are people
that are like,

49:43.730 --> 49:47.734
"Oh, God, good for you.
Jesus, what a mistake."

49:49.277 --> 49:50.612
I don't know
why people have them.

49:50.696 --> 49:52.698
I have nothing against them.
But it really seems that people

49:52.781 --> 49:54.491
don't know that
they don't have to have them.

49:54.574 --> 49:55.701
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

49:55.784 --> 49:57.035
Like, something just clicks on
and they're like,

49:57.119 --> 49:59.413
"I guess it's time." It's like,
It doesn't have to be.

49:59.496 --> 50:01.957
You're human. You can decide.
You're not a dog.

50:02.040 --> 50:04.292
It's not based on a smell.
Think about it.

50:04.376 --> 50:06.294
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

50:09.506 --> 50:10.966
But I just-- I never thought
about having them.

50:11.049 --> 50:12.426
I never really wanted
to have them.

50:12.509 --> 50:14.928
And people, you know, say to me,
you know, like,

50:15.011 --> 50:16.430
"Well, don't you get lonely?"
I'm like, "I do.

50:16.513 --> 50:18.807
I get very lonely.
But I never think, like, a kid

50:18.890 --> 50:20.100
would make this better,
you know?"

50:20.183 --> 50:23.854
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

50:23.937 --> 50:26.314
I've had two wives
and I got no kids.

50:26.398 --> 50:28.692
It takes a special kind
of asshole...

50:28.775 --> 50:31.361
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

50:31.445 --> 50:33.071
...to have two wives
and no kids.

50:33.155 --> 50:35.782
I think my second wife
put it like this,

50:35.866 --> 50:37.826
"You think I'm bringing
children into this?"

50:37.909 --> 50:40.495
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

50:42.038 --> 50:43.373
"It was a different time."

50:43.457 --> 50:49.296
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

50:52.591 --> 50:54.801
Look, if you have love
in your heart

50:54.885 --> 50:56.303
and you want to bring
a kid in the world

50:56.386 --> 50:57.763
'cause you want to spread
that love

50:57.846 --> 50:59.306
or whatever the way is.

51:00.891 --> 51:02.642
And that's your impulse,
that's your reason.

51:02.726 --> 51:03.935
Good. Do it, you know.

51:04.019 --> 51:06.146
You know, I think
it's a beautiful thing.

51:06.229 --> 51:07.481
But if you have nothing but like

51:07.564 --> 51:10.400
a weird void where your heart
should be

51:10.484 --> 51:12.694
and you think like,
"A kid will fill this."

51:14.738 --> 51:17.699
- Maybe don't do it. Maybe don't.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

51:17.783 --> 51:19.785
Because that void
will be passed along

51:19.868 --> 51:20.786
for generations.

51:20.869 --> 51:23.038
You can't stop the void
from moving.

51:25.916 --> 51:28.168
You can now track your void
on 23andMe.

51:28.251 --> 51:33.715
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

51:33.799 --> 51:37.719
My void started in the chest
of a tailor's wife in Belarus...

51:39.221 --> 51:42.682
in the 1850s,
in the Pale of Settlement,

51:42.766 --> 51:47.813
it was a-- It's a 99.9 percent
Ashkenazi void.

51:49.606 --> 51:52.484
And you've all been sitting
in it for an hour now.

51:52.567 --> 51:57.405
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

52:04.162 --> 52:08.708
People had children
during the pandemic.

52:08.792 --> 52:13.046
- What kind of...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

52:13.129 --> 52:16.424
...cynical, selfish weirdos...

52:17.551 --> 52:21.346
saw that as an opportunity
to start a family?

52:21.429 --> 52:24.516
Like, there's no cure,
there's no vaccine.

52:24.599 --> 52:26.518
And people are like,
"Let's have a baby."

52:27.936 --> 52:29.896
"What if we all die?"
"Then we'll die as a family."

52:29.980 --> 52:31.565
"I think we should do it."

52:36.319 --> 52:37.737
At some point,
those plague babies

52:37.821 --> 52:39.281
are going to want answers.
They're gonna...

52:39.364 --> 52:42.450
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- ...they're gonna want to know

52:42.534 --> 52:45.161
what it was like
before they were born.

52:45.245 --> 52:48.540
And some dad is going
to have to step up and be like,

52:48.623 --> 52:50.041
"All right, son, I think
you're ready to hear this,

52:50.125 --> 52:53.461
- you're five."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

52:54.838 --> 52:56.756
"Before you were born,
there was a horrible disease

52:56.840 --> 52:57.924
that was spreading
around the world

52:58.008 --> 52:59.050
that killed millions of people.

52:59.134 --> 53:01.595
And there was no cure
and no medicine for it.

53:01.678 --> 53:02.888
And we couldn't leave the house.

53:02.971 --> 53:04.556
Your mother and I
were stuck in the house,

53:04.639 --> 53:07.142
- for a long time!"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

53:07.225 --> 53:10.145
"We had to have food delivered.
It was dark and scary.

53:10.228 --> 53:11.313
You just couldn't leave
the house.

53:11.396 --> 53:13.523
And then eventually,
you had to.

53:13.607 --> 53:14.733
You just had to get out.

53:14.816 --> 53:17.569
And you had to wear gloves
and a mask and a visor.

53:17.652 --> 53:19.029
Yeah, kind of like a superhero.

53:19.112 --> 53:22.490
Like an angry superhero
that just needed some space."

53:22.574 --> 53:25.493
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

53:26.786 --> 53:28.288
"And then your mom
started making bread.

53:28.371 --> 53:29.497
I don't know why.

53:31.666 --> 53:32.667
So a lot of bread being made.

53:32.751 --> 53:34.002
It was like a bakery
at the house,

53:34.085 --> 53:36.254
sometimes two,
three loaves a day.

53:36.338 --> 53:37.756
Sometimes she'd walk
into the living room

53:37.839 --> 53:38.757
with a loaf and say,

53:38.840 --> 53:39.966
'I don't think
this one turned out,

53:40.050 --> 53:41.968
but we can still eat it.'

53:42.052 --> 53:43.219
And I ate it
because I didn't want

53:43.303 --> 53:45.639
to hurt her feelings.
It was a dark time!

53:46.473 --> 53:47.641
Then puzzles started coming.

53:47.724 --> 53:50.852
There were puzzles coming.
Yeah, I don't like puzzles.

53:50.936 --> 53:53.480
You don't like puzzles, do you?
They're terrible, right?

53:53.563 --> 53:54.773
I know, right?

53:54.856 --> 53:56.358
Hundreds of puzzles
it seemed like.

53:56.441 --> 53:57.776
We're doing puzzles
all the time.

53:57.859 --> 54:00.570
We're watching movies
we've seen, like, five times.

54:00.654 --> 54:03.031
We're eating bread.
It's the worst.

54:03.114 --> 54:04.699
It was terrible.
And then, you know,

54:04.783 --> 54:07.535
she starts drinking wine
and I'm like,

54:07.619 --> 54:09.704
'All right, if she's going
to do it, I'll drink scotch.'

54:09.788 --> 54:11.039
And at some point,
I just think

54:11.122 --> 54:12.624
we stopped
loving each other and..."

I don't know
what she was doing.

54:20.799 --> 54:22.676
It was just bad.
And, you know,

54:22.759 --> 54:24.844
we were fighting and drinking
and eating bread.

54:24.928 --> 54:26.554
And one time we were just
yelling at each other,

54:26.638 --> 54:28.807
we're crying,
and it was very sad

54:28.890 --> 54:29.975
and we didn't know what to do.

54:30.058 --> 54:31.810
And, you know,
I kicked over a puzzle

54:31.893 --> 54:34.229
because I was mad
and I don't know,

54:34.312 --> 54:36.147
we just ended up
having sex on the floor,

54:36.231 --> 54:37.232
right on the puzzle pieces.

54:37.315 --> 54:41.486
And puzzle pieces
were sticking to us.

that's when we made you."

She's coming. Just go.
I don't want to talk.

Just go out there. Go.

from the Samuel French

55:33.455 --> 55:35.290
The other reason I'm happy
I don't have kids is,

55:35.373 --> 55:38.418
I have friends my age
who have grown kids.

55:38.501 --> 55:40.295
Grown-ups.
And if I haven't seen

55:40.378 --> 55:42.881
that friend in a while
and ask him how his kids are,

55:42.964 --> 55:43.965
it's never a great story.

55:44.049 --> 55:46.926
- I mean, it's like...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

55:47.010 --> 55:50.013
...70 percent of the time,
it's not a good story. So...

55:50.096 --> 55:52.057
"Hey, man, long time.
How you been?"

55:52.140 --> 55:54.726
"I'm dealing,
you know how it is."

How are the kids?"

I don't know
what the fuck happened.

looking for him again.

It's just bullshit.
It's killing his mother.

I can't fucking take it.
Fuck that kid.

the same thing

56:28.551 --> 56:29.636
if they know me,
and I can't help

56:29.719 --> 56:31.554
but hear it as condescending,
where they're like,

56:31.638 --> 56:33.932
"Oh, that's right,
you still got cats.

"Go fuck yourself.

56:42.148 --> 56:44.609

than me

A better human?
Go fuck yourself."

56:55.870 --> 56:59.749
I have three cats that I love
and in the best case scenario,

56:59.833 --> 57:01.584
I'm going to have to have them
all killed.

57:01.668 --> 57:04.546
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

57:07.966 --> 57:10.343
I'm going to have to kill
my friends.

57:10.426 --> 57:12.971
And I knew it going in.
That's how big my heart is.

57:13.054 --> 57:16.391
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

57:19.227 --> 57:22.272
You can't have your drug-addled
son put down, can you?

57:22.355 --> 57:26.651
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

57:26.734 --> 57:29.404
No matter how much you want to,

57:29.487 --> 57:31.573
you can't walk
into a veterinarian's office

57:31.656 --> 57:34.450
and just say,
"I think it's time.

57:37.370 --> 57:40.540
He's not grooming himself.
He's barely eating.

57:40.623 --> 57:43.668
Can't keep his head up.
There we go. There we go."

57:46.462 --> 57:48.381
"This is
a veterinarian's office.

57:48.464 --> 57:51.259
We don't do people."
I'm like, "Doc, I got cash.

57:51.342 --> 57:53.887
How much would it take?
Just help me out.

57:53.970 --> 57:55.513
Do me a-- His mother thinks
he's dead already.

57:55.597 --> 57:57.891
Can't you just
bring him in back?

57:57.974 --> 58:00.268
Knock him out, burn him up,
put him in a box.

58:00.351 --> 58:03.897
And if you want, you give me
the handprint on the paper."

58:03.980 --> 58:08.109
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

58:08.193 --> 58:10.153
(CHUCKLES)
You kind of got to go

58:10.236 --> 58:11.863
all the way with that one.
I'm sorry, I...

58:11.946 --> 58:16.326
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

58:18.119 --> 58:21.080
"Yeah, man, it's 'cause
I'm an anti-woke comedian."

58:21.164 --> 58:24.125
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

58:28.338 --> 58:30.256
So... (EXHALES DEEPLY)

58:30.340 --> 58:32.383
...I almost bought
a gun recently.

58:35.261 --> 58:36.721
My friends are like, "What,
just for home protection?"

58:36.804 --> 58:39.098
I'm like, "I don't know.
It just feels like it's time."

58:39.182 --> 58:42.977
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- (CHUCKLES)

58:43.061 --> 58:45.730
"What do you mean?"
"When they come around

58:45.813 --> 58:48.399
looking for Jews
who have had HBO specials..."

58:48.483 --> 58:55.573
(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)

58:55.657 --> 58:58.159
"...I just want to go
down shooting, that's all.

58:58.243 --> 58:59.202
I don't think I'll win.

58:59.285 --> 59:00.286
I just want
to go down shooting.

59:00.370 --> 59:01.913
That's my right
as an American.

59:01.996 --> 59:04.040
That's what
the Second Amendment
is all about.

59:04.123 --> 59:05.750
It's like--
It's not about gun ownership.

59:05.833 --> 59:07.752
It's about going down shooting!"

59:07.835 --> 59:12.382
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

59:12.465 --> 59:14.384
I currently have a bat.

59:17.553 --> 59:19.138
I'm a grown man
with my own house

59:19.222 --> 59:20.974
on the second floor,
in his own bedroom,

59:21.057 --> 59:24.978
with a bat next to his bed.
That you can see.

59:25.061 --> 59:27.981
- Like I live in a dorm room.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

59:31.234 --> 59:33.695
And I'll be honest with you,
I don't think I could hit

59:33.778 --> 59:35.113
a guy with a bat...

59:36.531 --> 59:38.533
let alone shoot a guy
with a gun. I mean...

59:39.534 --> 59:41.077
if you're going
to hit a guy with a bat,

59:41.160 --> 59:43.204
you better have hit a guy
with a bat before.

59:43.288 --> 59:46.624
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

59:46.708 --> 59:48.876
Or you're just going to end up
getting hit with your own bat.

59:48.960 --> 59:51.129
That's how that's going to go.
And it's...

59:51.212 --> 59:53.423
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

59:53.506 --> 59:56.050
...and it's going
to happen very quickly.

59:56.134 --> 59:58.344
And you're not even
going to understand how.

59:58.428 --> 1:00:01.639
You'll just be like,
"Get the fuck out of my head!

1:00:01.723 --> 1:00:03.224
What's happening?

1:00:03.308 --> 1:00:05.852
Why am I running in my house?
Ow!"

1:00:10.398 --> 1:00:11.441
And I have an alarm system.

1:00:11.524 --> 1:00:13.651
I have a very expensive,
multi-laser alarm system

1:00:13.735 --> 1:00:16.821
that protects the gemstone
I have in my foyer.

1:00:16.904 --> 1:00:19.782
- It's a...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1:00:19.866 --> 1:00:21.826
Yeah, it's a gift
from George Soros.

1:00:21.909 --> 1:00:25.330
- It's the bonus level.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1:00:25.413 --> 1:00:28.499
You know, when you replace
a certain number.

1:00:28.583 --> 1:00:32.337
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1:00:32.420 --> 1:00:35.965
But even with the alarm,
if I hear something in my house,

1:00:36.049 --> 1:00:39.552
I'll pick up that bat,
upstairs, in my boxers.

1:00:39.635 --> 1:00:42.764
And I'll pick it up
and walk around.

1:00:43.473 --> 1:00:44.557
And a voice comes out of me

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:46.934
that only comes out of me
when I'm holding a bat.

1:00:47.018 --> 1:00:48.436
And I'll do it for you.
But brace yourself.

1:00:48.519 --> 1:00:51.689
- It's intense.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1:00:51.773 --> 1:00:53.358
"What's going on down there?"

1:00:53.441 --> 1:00:57.904
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1:00:57.987 --> 1:01:00.073
"Who's down there?
What's going on?"

1:01:02.950 --> 1:01:05.286
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)

1:01:05.370 --> 1:01:08.206
MARC: Yeah. Right.

1:01:08.289 --> 1:01:11.000
If you're breaking
into my house, you take pause.

1:01:11.084 --> 1:01:14.879
"Holy shit. You hear that, man?
That guy means business.

1:01:16.089 --> 1:01:18.216
Sounds like he's got
a bat up there.

1:01:19.300 --> 1:01:20.593
I've been doing this
a long time.

1:01:20.676 --> 1:01:22.428
That's definitely bat voice."

1:01:23.888 --> 1:01:25.681
"I'm coming down there!"

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:26.891
"He won't.

1:01:27.809 --> 1:01:29.394
- Not that guy."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1:01:29.477 --> 1:01:31.437
(CHUCKLES)
"Let's just take the Jew stone

1:01:31.521 --> 1:01:34.023
- and get out of here."
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1:01:37.819 --> 1:01:40.780
But I'll be honest with you,
I like having a bat because...

1:01:42.365 --> 1:01:44.242
it's good. A bat is good.

1:01:44.325 --> 1:01:48.079
Beca-- Look, I'm a-- You know,
I'm a moody person.

1:01:48.162 --> 1:01:50.415
I have good days,
I have bad days, you know.

1:01:51.833 --> 1:01:52.750
But in my heart,

1:01:52.834 --> 1:01:56.629
I know, that no matter
how bad my day is,

1:01:56.712 --> 1:01:59.006
I'm never going to look
at a bat and think,

1:01:59.841 --> 1:02:01.300
"I'm going to kill myself."

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1:02:16.357 --> 1:02:19.318

I don't think I have.

I got to remember that.
