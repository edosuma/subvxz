38:26.471 --> 38:29.138
Not answering.
(keys clack)

38:29.174 --> 38:32.141
- You know,
that was really something,

38:32.177 --> 38:34.411
What you did out there today.

38:34.413 --> 38:36.946
- (chuckles)
thank you.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.649
- You must have some part
of a rancher's chip

38:39.718 --> 38:41.650
In your dna.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.620
- Cheers.
(glasses clink)

38:49.961 --> 38:51.694
- So, were you serious?

38:53.065 --> 38:54.730
- About what?

38:54.766 --> 38:57.800
- Would you wanna be part of
our cattle business one day?

38:57.836 --> 39:00.770
- Oh, well I don't know
if I'm qualified.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.339
- Lou.

39:02.474 --> 39:05.508
- Look, do you wanna know
what hurt the most?

39:05.544 --> 39:07.977
You assumed amy could do it,

39:08.046 --> 39:09.779
But I was overlooked.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.183
That hurt.

39:14.219 --> 39:15.985
- And I'm sorry about that.

39:17.155 --> 39:18.721
But the truth is,

39:18.757 --> 39:21.591
I never wanna make you or amy
feel that you're obligated

39:21.726 --> 39:24.327
To take over this ranch.

39:24.462 --> 39:26.529
That's what my father did
with me,

39:26.531 --> 39:28.731
And there's no way I would
expect that

39:28.734 --> 39:30.666
From either of you girls.

39:30.736 --> 39:34.470
I'd rather you just
think about it.

39:34.539 --> 39:37.474
Make the decision on your own
when the time comes.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.410
- Grandpa.

39:41.412 --> 39:42.412
- But hey...

39:43.949 --> 39:46.182
What you did today,

39:46.218 --> 39:49.018
I couldn't be more proud.

Hey!

39:59.831 --> 40:02.231
- Jess. Look, I um...

40:03.402 --> 40:05.367
I'm sorry about how
I behaved earlier.

40:05.404 --> 40:07.036
- No, no, there's no need.
I get it.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.305
I wasn't respecting your space.

40:09.374 --> 40:10.840
- You know what?
It's really,

40:10.842 --> 40:14.310
It was really more about me,
than anything.

40:14.379 --> 40:16.045
I was pretty thrown
when you and my dad

40:16.181 --> 40:17.546
Came back from that trip...

40:18.717 --> 40:20.417
Married. I mean...

40:21.787 --> 40:23.720
Talk about world's colliding,
right?

40:23.855 --> 40:25.989
- I can see how that would be
a shock. (chuckles)

40:26.124 --> 40:28.591
- But um, I really am happy
for you both.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.460
- Thank you.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.462
(car rumbling, remi barks)

40:33.598 --> 40:36.466
- Um...Will you excuse me?
- Yeah, of course.

40:38.336 --> 40:39.869
- (readying exhale)

40:40.004 --> 40:41.804
Peter! Uh...

40:45.010 --> 40:46.942
What are you doing here?

40:48.013 --> 40:50.480
- I think we should
probably talk, right?

40:52.584 --> 40:54.950
- Yeah.
(breathes shakily)

40:56.454 --> 40:58.688
Lisa: Oh, well he's looking
much more comfortable.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.957
- Yeah, luckily the puncture
didn't hit anything major,

41:01.026 --> 41:04.260
So, after a little time off,
he should make a full recovery.

41:04.329 --> 41:06.029
I have to say,

41:06.164 --> 41:07.964
I was worried about him
at the start of the ride.

41:08.033 --> 41:11.166
I'm so used to having spartan,
who is just so easy.

41:11.203 --> 41:13.970
Working with a colt,
in a new situation,

41:13.972 --> 41:16.672
Doesn't always go
as smoothly as you'd hope.

41:16.708 --> 41:19.308
But, all things considered,
I think he did really well.

41:19.377 --> 41:21.711
- Good horsey.
All: (chuckle)

41:21.846 --> 41:24.581
- He is.
I think this whole thing

41:24.716 --> 41:26.516
Really brought us
closer together, too.

41:26.651 --> 41:29.118
- Aw.
- How were things here, huh?

41:29.120 --> 41:30.920
- Oh, well, um,

41:30.989 --> 41:32.989
I ended up having
a business lunch, so...

41:33.058 --> 41:35.325
Katie and parker
looked after lyndy.

- It was!

41:37.595 --> 41:39.461
- It was awesome!

41:39.498 --> 41:42.131
We even played hide-and-seek,
and I won!

41:42.200 --> 41:43.600
- Did you?

41:43.602 --> 41:45.735
- Yes! She certainly did.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.870
- Well, it sounds like things
went off without a hitch, huh?

41:47.873 --> 41:50.073
- Yeah, pretty much.
Pretty much.
