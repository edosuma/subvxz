WEBVTT

00:09.509 --> 00:10.927
Aw.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.930
The day every mother dreams of,

00:14.014 --> 00:16.349
when her daughter grows a vampire head.

00:17.725 --> 00:19.352
Hi, Ms. Alvarez.

00:19.436 --> 00:22.439
We were working really hard
on our immigration project for school,

00:22.522 --> 00:23.565
so we took a little power nap.

00:23.648 --> 00:26.318
Oh, 9:00 to 3:00 workday
getting you down?

00:26.401 --> 00:29.862
Yeah. I take power naps, too.
It's called blinking.

00:29.946 --> 00:31.281
[snores and gasps] I'm so refreshed.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.368
-Oh, can Carmen stay for dinner?
-Of course.

00:35.452 --> 00:36.869
Thanks, Ms. Alvarez.

00:38.330 --> 00:39.831
Carmen's staying for dinner.

00:39.914 --> 00:42.500
[Lydia] It's okay.
Schneider is staying, too.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.585
See? We take in all strays.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.337
Except for cats.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.798
They steal your breath
and turn you into a  cucuy.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.970
Let's be happy Elena
finally has a real friend,

00:54.054 --> 00:55.513
you know,
and not someone from the Internet

00:55.597 --> 00:57.640
who'd probably end up
being a 35-year-old man.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.309
Under all that makeup, who knows?

01:00.560 --> 01:02.479
Mami,  I am serious, okay?

01:02.562 --> 01:04.814
Carmen gets straight A's.
All they do is study.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.566
Pero  still, that friendship

01:06.649 --> 01:09.902
is a little bit, eh,  cómo se dice?
Intense.

01:11.113 --> 01:13.115
They're teenage girls.

01:13.198 --> 01:16.993
Yeah, but no, no, no. I think
there's something a little bit, uh, queer.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.830
[laughs] What? I don't even think
you know what that word means.

01:20.913 --> 01:21.914
Oh, I know.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.126
You said the same thing
about me and Kathy Trecker,

01:24.209 --> 01:27.420
because we started sharing clothes
and we both wanted to marry Ricky Martin?

01:27.504 --> 01:28.755
See? Queer.

01:30.798 --> 01:34.427
You know what? You got us.
Kathy, come out of the bedroom!

01:35.637 --> 01:36.763
[laughs sarcastically]

01:36.846 --> 01:40.142
-[chuckles]
-Look at you. In a good mood, huh?

01:40.225 --> 01:42.394
[chuckles] It's the drugs, isn't it?

01:44.896 --> 01:46.148
Definitely.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.984
But also, Dr. Berkowitz's birthday party.
I got it all planned out.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.363
Apparently, last year,
he ended up at Medieval Times by himself.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.656
Oh.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.658
He went to pet a horse and got bit.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.538
[both laughing]

02:04.207 --> 02:05.291
Pobrecito.

02:06.709 --> 02:09.504
So I got Scott and Lori
to get balloons and a cake.

02:09.587 --> 02:10.797
So, I got everything covered.

02:12.048 --> 02:15.051
Glad you're here.
It's baseball fundraiser time again.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.554
Abuelita,  these are for you
to sell at church.

02:17.637 --> 02:21.015
And, Mom, I guess at work,
or wherever you go?

02:22.099 --> 02:25.395
Deadline is Friday.
Most sales gets a PlayStation.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.522
So let's really get after it, people.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.233
Ooh, got a great idea.

02:30.817 --> 02:31.860
Sell them yourself.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.821
Go! Go out in the neighborhood.
Sell them out there.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.407
Aren't you worried about predators?
I'm very cute.

02:39.826 --> 02:40.910
I'm not worried.

02:40.993 --> 02:43.621
Your  abuelita  will be three feet
behind you at all times.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.998
Come on.
Work up a good sales pitch.

02:46.082 --> 02:49.377
It'll be so much more gratifying
if you earn that PlayStation yourself.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.296
[groans] This is the worst.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.131
There's my little go-getter!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.133
Hey, Mom, can Carmen stay overnight?

02:55.633 --> 02:57.219
We're having so much fun.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.639
Why doesn't she sleep out here
on  el   sofá ?

03:01.723 --> 03:03.600
It will be more comfortable
than the floor.

03:03.683 --> 03:05.227
Oh, she just sleeps in bed with me.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.777
I'm not saying anything.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.865
Good. 'Cause everyone
should feel at home here.

03:19.907 --> 03:21.033
[sighs]

03:23.536 --> 03:26.205
Hey, guys.
I fixed the water pressure and tested it.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.124
Hey, let's push dinner a smidge, okay?

03:28.207 --> 03:29.626
Ooh, rice again?

03:29.709 --> 03:32.379
Can we not?
I'm doin' a little Paleo thing right now.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.714
Also, I borrowed your nail clippers.
See you in 20.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.761
I think peoples feel at home.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.639
[theme song playing]

04:33.606 --> 04:35.442
[laughing] Hey.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.360
Hey. Where have you two been?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.737
Where's the cake?
Where are the balloons?

04:40.572 --> 04:42.324
[both] Oh...

04:44.241 --> 04:46.453
Sorry, I forgot to get
the balloons last night.

04:47.036 --> 04:48.955
So why didn't you get them on your way in?

04:49.038 --> 04:50.081
I didn't wanna be late.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.750
-But you are late!
-But I didn't want to be.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.587
You know what's weird?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.171
The bakery where you told me
to pick up the cake?

04:57.254 --> 05:00.091
[laughing] I was there
getting coffee this morning.

05:02.427 --> 05:06.055
Okay, this? This right here
is why we have two stars on Yelp.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.810
Are you guys getting any service?

05:10.893 --> 05:14.939
I haven't gotten a birthday call
or e-mail or text.

05:15.022 --> 05:17.942
-Well, the office is kind of a dead spot.
-I've got four bars!

05:19.861 --> 05:22.196
-My daughter did call.
-There you go.

05:22.279 --> 05:24.407
She wanted my Netflix password.

05:26.659 --> 05:30.580
My birthday didn't come up,
and my password is my birthday!

05:32.415 --> 05:34.584
But at least you guys remembered.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.420
Uh, I believe I said...

05:38.129 --> 05:40.006
grocery store sheet cake?

05:46.596 --> 05:48.305
You guys forgot, too?

05:48.389 --> 05:50.808
No, we... we didn't forget.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.608
"Y birthday"?

06:01.903 --> 06:05.239
Well said, banner. Well said.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.411
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[stammers] I have, um... [snaps fingers]

06:10.953 --> 06:12.955
You got me.
I was trying to keep it a surprise.

06:13.831 --> 06:16.876
I am having you over
for a birthday dinner.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.545
-Tonight?
-Tonight?

06:19.879 --> 06:22.381
-I'm free!
-Great! Tonight! It's happening!

06:22.465 --> 06:24.175
So it's a party?
I can invite all my friends?

06:24.258 --> 06:25.342
Uh, sure.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.261
Great! Lori, Scott,
want to come to my birthday party?

06:27.344 --> 06:29.806
No, no, not them.
I mean, I'm sure they're busy.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.892
Nope. My husband has couples counseling
with the dog, so I'm free.

06:34.436 --> 06:36.896
I got kicked off Tinder, so... so am I.

06:40.357 --> 06:41.526
So, it's gonna be this.

06:42.735 --> 06:43.945
But in my home?

06:45.363 --> 06:46.239
Great!

06:48.575 --> 06:50.367
All right, I got the party box.

06:52.161 --> 06:54.831
I got some, uh,
birthday candles, party hats.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.917
This cowboy stuff is no good to me.
Oh, look, look.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.628
Decorative plates left over
from Lisette's baby shower.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.797
They say, "It's a boy,"
so, technically, it works.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.383
Okay. Give me a status report.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.011
Rice is on the stove,
costillas  in the marinade,

07:09.095 --> 07:10.513
and I look fantastic!

07:11.806 --> 07:14.517
Schneider! Where's that centerpiece
you promised me?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.603
The gourd is drying, as is the glitter.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.646
Got away from me a little bit,
I'm not gonna lie.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.441
Sounds like a train wreck. Go get it.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.069
Oh, no, no, Alex, you gotta put that away.

07:25.152 --> 07:26.362
You said I have to sell them.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.615
We're about to have a house
full of customers.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.325
Oh, you know what? They got money.
Clean 'em out,  papito.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.705
-I made my sangria.
-Two pitchers?

07:36.664 --> 07:39.667
Last time I drank that, I woke up naked
in the tub with a French braid.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.753
And I don't know how to French braid.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.175
Don't worry.
It's going to be a very classy night.

07:47.675 --> 07:51.596
Papito,  crawl onto the fire escape
and put this on the grill.

07:51.679 --> 07:55.391
Oh, oh, and take this stick
in case of the raccoon.

07:58.519 --> 07:59.479
Oh, Carmen.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.189
We're taking a little break
from our immigration project.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.567
We're really hitting a wall. [chuckles]

08:07.445 --> 08:09.197
You're not as funny as your mom.

08:13.409 --> 08:16.496
Guys, guys, oh, my...
I'm sorry.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.998
I'm throwing a sad man
a stupid party. [chuckles]

08:19.081 --> 08:20.500
It's gonna make him really happy,

08:20.583 --> 08:22.627
but I don't think Carmen
needs to be around for it.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.211
-What?
-Hey!

08:24.295 --> 08:26.798
Elena, it's fine.
I'll go get my stuff.

08:26.881 --> 08:30.301
No, no, no. It's not fine.
She has to stay. This isn't fair!

08:30.384 --> 08:31.761
She's been here most of the week.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.722
Can she only survive
in this apartment's atmosphere?

08:36.432 --> 08:38.851
-You guys can take the night off.
-No!

08:39.727 --> 08:41.228
You better watch that attitude.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.272
This is not a big deal,
so why are you making it one?

08:44.941 --> 08:47.234
And during the party,
you can't just hide in your room.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.236
-You have to participate.
-Why?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.906
Because I am raising
a polite human person.

08:51.989 --> 08:54.659
And if I don't get to hide in my room,
no one does.

08:56.243 --> 08:57.494
It's cool.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.371
Sorry, I didn't mean to be any trouble.

08:59.455 --> 09:03.042
No, honey, no. You're not trouble.
The trouble's arriving in ten minutes.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.502
I'm sparing you, trust me.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.880
[sighs] Text me later, okay?

09:08.464 --> 09:09.382
You know I will.

09:19.391 --> 09:21.644
I feel like I'm watching
the end of  Titanic.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.940
Queer.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.152
Ugh. That's the centerpiece?

09:30.236 --> 09:31.862
It's not his memorial service.

09:32.363 --> 09:35.282
You only gave me five hours and no theme.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.243
-[knock on door]
-Oh, God damn it. Okay.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.120
-You know what? Just... put it down.
-[grunts]

09:40.329 --> 09:41.289
Okay.

09:41.789 --> 09:44.584
Okay. Now listen.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.336
This is a very sweet and lonely guy.

09:47.419 --> 09:50.214
I've seen him riding
a tandem bicycle by himself.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.011
Are we ready? Are we ready?

09:55.094 --> 09:56.262
Espérate, espérate.

09:56.846 --> 09:57.888
Ay, ay!

09:58.806 --> 09:59.932
Dale.

10:02.351 --> 10:03.561
[inhales sharply]

10:04.353 --> 10:05.562
Hey, welcome!

10:05.647 --> 10:06.689
-Hey!
-How are you?

10:06.773 --> 10:09.025
I picked everybody up
to make sure they'd come.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.276
Great. That's great.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.360
Hi.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.489
Happy birthday, Dr. Berkowitz.

10:15.572 --> 10:17.408
Oh, please, call me Leslie.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.827
Why would I do that?
That is a woman's name.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.081
It is also my name.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.958
Uh, that's too bad.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.921
Brought you a bottle of wine
somebody left at my house.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.672
I don't do Zin.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.092
Oh, hi, Alex!

10:35.176 --> 10:37.469
Hi, I'm Alex Alvarez.

10:39.555 --> 10:42.058
Youth sports is one of the most
important activities--

10:42.141 --> 10:45.394
Okay, okay, okay. Not yet, Willy Wonka.
Let them sit down.

10:48.564 --> 10:52.026
And, uh, where is that
delightful daughter of yours?

10:52.109 --> 10:53.778
Oh, yeah. Elena!

10:58.449 --> 11:00.785
She is so excited about your party.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.664
[all laughing]

11:06.374 --> 11:07.458
And then this one says,

11:07.541 --> 11:10.086
"Doc, that's not apple juice!"

11:10.169 --> 11:11.295
[all laughing]

11:14.757 --> 11:18.052
That is the last time
I misplaced my glasses.

11:19.428 --> 11:23.933
And just to be safe, I bought him a cup
that says "not urine" on it.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.684
-[all laughing]
-Yeah, yeah.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.980
So you don't drink  el  pee-pee.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.231
[all laughing]

11:33.192 --> 11:35.527
I don't know if it's the sangria,
but I am havin' a great time.

11:35.611 --> 11:39.073
-[chuckles] It's the sangria.
-[laughing]

11:39.156 --> 11:40.532
Good thing you drove.

11:41.492 --> 11:45.204
Unless somebody else wants
to give me a ride? [laughs]

11:45.287 --> 11:49.000
Oh, I am flattered, married lady.

11:54.546 --> 11:57.466
Always interesting to be
the sober one at a dinner party.

11:58.467 --> 12:02.054
Now if memory serves,
next stage is dancing.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.515
[gasps] That's a great idea!
Whoo-hoo!

12:09.937 --> 12:12.774
We should probably put some music on
to make this less weird.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.485
No, let this ride a while.

12:16.568 --> 12:18.154
[sighs]

12:18.237 --> 12:21.615
It makes me sad to see  Americanos  dance.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.495
♪ I've got the looks ♪

12:26.578 --> 12:29.623
♪ I've got the body, yeah... ♪

12:29.706 --> 12:30.749
Mom, I got this.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.545
Hi, I'm Alex Alvarez.

12:34.628 --> 12:38.132
Youth sports is one of the most important
activities in building character--

12:38.215 --> 12:40.342
I'll buy five. [chuckles]

12:41.677 --> 12:43.012
[whispers] We can share.

12:43.095 --> 12:46.307
Oh, that's really sweet, but I'm kinda
doing a little Paleo thing right now.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.475
-Ooh. It's working. [chuckles]
-Okay.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.646
This is so much fun, Penelope.

12:52.729 --> 12:55.524
Well, I'm glad you're having a good time.
But it's not over yet.

especially Penelope, for this day.

14:00.965 --> 14:04.385
And thank you for making me feel
like I belong. [chuckles]

14:04.468 --> 14:07.054
Ah,  y?  Are you going
to blow out the candles?

14:07.554 --> 14:10.641
If I don't,
maybe this moment will last forever.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.685
Aw.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.728
But it won't.
Blow them out.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.985
-[blows]
-Bravo!

14:21.068 --> 14:22.904
[all cheering]

14:24.113 --> 14:26.323
All right. Is it over?
Can I go to my room now?

14:26.407 --> 14:29.535
Please, Elena, lighten up.
We did a good thing here.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.996
Have some cake.
Forget about Carmen for one second.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.747
[Elena sighs]

14:33.830 --> 14:36.208
-Oh,  Mami,  you forgot the knife.
-Ah.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.255
-[Lori gasps]
-[Penelope] Where's that cake knife?

14:41.338 --> 14:43.590
Remember the fancy one we borrowed
from Marie Callender's?

14:43.674 --> 14:45.885
There's a  Walking Dead
on your fire escape!

14:48.721 --> 14:52.933
Is this part of my birthday,
like a singing Grim Reaper?

14:54.435 --> 14:56.270
You guys are the best!

14:57.229 --> 14:59.731
No, Dr. Berkowitz,
that's actually Elena's friend.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.861
I don't get it. Why was Carmen trying
to come in through the window?

15:03.945 --> 15:05.529
Yeah, that was a little, uh...

15:05.613 --> 15:07.531
Queer?

15:10.659 --> 15:11.785
You come here.

15:13.870 --> 15:15.497
Is... is everything all right?

15:15.581 --> 15:17.583
Yeah, everything is great.
Mami,  cut the cake, please.

15:17.666 --> 15:19.627
And, uh, you guys go ahead and eat.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.297
-What are you two trying to pull?
-Nothing.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.882
[sighs] You don't understand.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.219
Text her.
Make sure she gets home okay.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.637
And after the party, we're gonna talk
about you and Carmen.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.766
Oh, now that I've bought all this candy,

15:34.850 --> 15:37.103
I'd love to come see
some of your ballgames.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.229
Uh, that'd be weird.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.400
He sounds just like my kids.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.776
[Penelope chuckles]

15:46.236 --> 15:48.614
I'm sorry, everyone.
It's, uh, teenage girls, you know.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.032
Everything is very dramatic.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.450
It must be about a boy.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.078
[sing-song] I don't think so.

15:57.581 --> 15:59.124
No, I think they're both stressed

15:59.208 --> 16:01.168
about their big immigration project
for school.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.712
Immigration project?
Why haven't they come to me?

16:03.795 --> 16:04.880
Why would they go to you?

16:05.923 --> 16:06.799
Oh, boy.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.013
[sighs] Well, there's no stoppin' now.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.811
-[exhales]
-What's happening?

16:21.981 --> 16:23.941
I immigrated here illegally.
I'm a Canadian.

16:24.025 --> 16:26.818
[mocks gasping] Shocking! I know.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.409
Oh, I thought you were all gonna do that.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.787
So, you're an illegal alien?

16:37.371 --> 16:39.123
Well, we prefer "undocumented."

16:41.083 --> 16:45.045
But yeah, born in the 'Couve,
overstayed my student visa,

16:45.546 --> 16:48.882
forced to live in the shadows
of Pepperdine University.

16:51.343 --> 16:54.180
Took me a while to get rid of the accent,
but now I can say

16:54.263 --> 16:58.684
[in exaggerated American accent]
I am sorry about that.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.858
Wow. You must have been
very brave, Schneider,

17:06.942 --> 17:09.361
coming here with everything.

17:10.862 --> 17:13.490
Knowing only the entire language

17:13.574 --> 17:16.285
and struggling to unlearn
the metric system.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.499
I sense a liter of sarcasm.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.797
Anyway, it's fine now.
My lawyers made it all okay.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.091
-Well, that's good.
-[Schneider] Yeah.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.967
But if you wanna hear
a real immigration story--

17:32.051 --> 17:34.136
Havana, 1962.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.976
I came here as a child,
fleeing an oppressive regime,

17:41.060 --> 17:44.688
with only my natural charm
and perfect legs.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.734
Here she goes.

17:48.817 --> 17:52.113
And you know, it was written
that I was Cuba's greatest dancer.

17:52.696 --> 17:53.739
Whoa. Who wrote that?

17:57.534 --> 17:59.745
Just because I wrote it,
doesn't mean it wasn't true.

18:01.788 --> 18:03.790
I bet you were fabulous.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.542
Oh,  completamente.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.295
And then... [sighs] Castro.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.005
-Mmm.
-La Revolución.

18:10.589 --> 18:14.426
The Catholic Church
had a program called Pedro Pan

18:14.510 --> 18:16.803
that invited the Cuban children
to come over.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.597
And they gave us our papers.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.682
And I RSVP'd "Yes."

18:24.060 --> 18:26.605
It's my little joke. There was no RSVP.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.774
[all laughing]

18:28.857 --> 18:32.111
Oh, that's great.
At least you did it the right way.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.904
Oh, Scott. [chuckles]

18:33.987 --> 18:36.072
Don't ruin the night by being you.

18:36.157 --> 18:39.368
I'm just being honest.
There's a right way and a wrong way,

18:39.451 --> 18:40.952
and a lot of people
are doing it the wrong way.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.789
How come when people say,
"I'm just being honest,"

18:43.872 --> 18:45.832
something terrible always comes next?

18:45.916 --> 18:46.958
You know, it's never like,

18:47.042 --> 18:49.336
"Hey, I'm just being honest.
You look hot."

18:51.130 --> 18:53.299
I said that to you once.
You got mad at me.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.512
Because it was in the workplace.
Do you understand anything?

18:58.595 --> 19:00.806
-So I can say it now?
-Technically, but don't.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.270
Such stimulating dinner party repartee.

19:07.103 --> 19:10.524
Anyway, what's so wrong about saying
people should follow the rules?

19:10.607 --> 19:13.319
You wanna come to America, get in line.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.780
Oh, the one that's ten years long,
full of hard-working people

19:16.864 --> 19:20.492
that'll do jobs that some Americans
won't do? Like picking fruit?

19:20.576 --> 19:23.829
Or remembering to buy balloons and a cake
for a birthday party?

19:23.912 --> 19:25.831
[crying] I'm so sorry.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.003
-Oh, yeah, we're at this stage now.
-[continues crying]

19:33.172 --> 19:35.424
The next stage can't happen!

19:37.968 --> 19:40.262
It's just the country's full up.

19:40.346 --> 19:44.558
Like a bar. It was free before 8:00 p.m.,
but now you gotta pay a cover.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.561
Sorry, but we can't just take everybody.

19:47.644 --> 19:50.189
-[scoffs]
-El   bobo  is right.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.817
-What?
-Everyone should follow the rules.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.902
I did, Schneider did.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.654
I did not, actually.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.159
Lot of lawyers, lot of fines.

20:02.909 --> 20:04.160
Mami,  seriously?

20:05.120 --> 20:07.581
What you went through was terrible.

20:07.664 --> 20:11.001
But at least, you had a place to go,
and you were welcomed with open arms.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.795
There are persecuted people
all around the world

20:13.879 --> 20:16.548
who would love the opportunity
to come here, but they can't.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.467
Because the rules are different
for different people.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.929
So some of them break the law
and they do what they have to do to fight

20:22.012 --> 20:24.806
for better lives
for themselves and their families.

20:24.890 --> 20:25.807
And you know what?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.060
I get it.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.605
Mom?

20:32.481 --> 20:33.732
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:33.815 --> 20:34.650
Yeah.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.860
Uh, excuse me, I'll be right back.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.238
[Elena sighs]

20:40.697 --> 20:42.074
Carmen's in my room right now.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.784
What? Elena!

20:43.867 --> 20:46.453
-She has nowhere else to go.
-What are you talking about?

20:47.371 --> 20:48.455
Where are her parents?

20:49.539 --> 20:52.042
Mexico. They were deported.

20:55.796 --> 20:56.880
[sighs]

20:58.465 --> 20:59.466
All right, stay here.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.095
Hey, everyone. [chuckles]

21:04.680 --> 21:06.723
We had a lot of fun,
but it is a school night.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.059
And it's way past the kids' bedtime.

21:09.142 --> 21:10.185
Okay, okay.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.397
There's nothing worse
than a guest who overstays his welcome.

21:14.022 --> 21:17.317
But I did notice a  Monopoly  board.
[chuckles]

21:19.528 --> 21:21.822
You know what?
Let's just wrap this up.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.658
We really should.

21:30.246 --> 21:31.707
Okay, they're gone.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.083
Lori threw up, but the good news is

21:33.166 --> 21:35.210
she made it to the hall,
so it's a Schneider problem.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.340
[sighs] What do I do?

21:40.257 --> 21:42.843
Do I drive you somewhere?
Is there a detention center?

21:43.343 --> 21:45.053
Pero,  uh,  qué pasó?

21:46.471 --> 21:47.597
My dad got sick,

21:47.681 --> 21:51.810
and they heard about this doctor
that helps undocumented people.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.980
But he was south of the checkpoint.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.399
Her parents got picked up coming back.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.735
-[gasps]
-Ay, niña.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.362
[Lydia]  Dios mío.

22:02.863 --> 22:05.741
So, the immigration project?

22:06.408 --> 22:08.369
I am the immigration project.

22:10.412 --> 22:13.039
I was too scared to tell you.
I... I'm sorry I lied.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.333
[clicks tongue]

22:16.460 --> 22:20.005
You gotta tell me stuff,
even if it's not great.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.965
Especially if it's not great.

22:22.674 --> 22:25.927
We take care of people.
That's what our family does, right?

22:26.928 --> 22:27.929
Right.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.560
-When did this happen?
-Two weeks ago.

22:34.394 --> 22:35.437
Two weeks?

22:37.355 --> 22:39.149
So have you been staying here
this whole time?

22:39.232 --> 22:41.192
Yeah. Most nights after dinner,

22:41.276 --> 22:44.071
I leave and I sneak back up
through the fire escape.

22:44.154 --> 22:44.988
[Lydia] Oh.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.991
Are you the raccoon?

22:53.080 --> 22:53.914
Yeah.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.626
But I felt really bad
that we didn't tell you guys.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.836
So I've been trying
to help out around here.

23:00.921 --> 23:04.340
That's why I did the laundry
and reorganized the pantry.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.718
Oh, was that you? [gasps]

23:07.636 --> 23:09.387
Alphabetical order.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.557
I love it.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.189
That was very sweet of you, Carmen.
But I wish you would've come to me.

23:20.273 --> 23:22.317
How long did you think
you could keep this up?

23:23.902 --> 23:24.778
A year.

23:24.861 --> 23:25.987
What? [scoffs]

23:27.989 --> 23:29.533
We're gonna need more rice.

23:33.203 --> 23:37.165
She wants to graduate with her class.
And she was born here.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.709
She's never even been to Mexico,
not even Cabo.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.714
My parents didn't do anything wrong.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.174
They both work two jobs.

23:46.257 --> 23:49.052
I'm on scholarship at St. B's,
and I get good grades.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.430
We're a normal American family.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.850
We had tickets to see  Frozen   on Ice .

23:56.685 --> 23:57.894
You like  Frozen?

23:58.770 --> 24:00.480
Sometimes the skaters fall.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.816
[chuckles]

24:04.985 --> 24:06.945
Have you been able
to speak to your parents?

24:08.446 --> 24:09.781
Yeah. [sniffles]

24:10.740 --> 24:11.992
What do they say you should do?

24:12.493 --> 24:15.453
They said I'm supposed to go
to my brother's in Texas.

24:16.913 --> 24:19.374
Well, then I think
that's what you need to do, Carmen.

24:19.457 --> 24:23.169
No... Mom! Texas?
The worst place on the planet?

24:25.672 --> 24:28.299
-He lives in Austin.
-Austin!

24:29.968 --> 24:31.970
Actually, I hear Austin's pretty chill.

24:35.515 --> 24:38.768
You can stay with us until we figure out
how to get you to Austin, okay?

24:39.477 --> 24:40.937
But you need to be with your family.

24:47.360 --> 24:50.113
[sniffles] I can't believe they sent
your parents back home.

24:51.114 --> 24:52.533
They didn't send them home.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.243
They sent them away.

24:55.326 --> 24:56.620
[both crying]

25:07.130 --> 25:09.132
Okay, guys.
I think it's time to leave.

25:11.801 --> 25:12.636
Carmen.

25:13.762 --> 25:14.971
This is my favorite duffel.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.767
It got me through war, and I'm pretty sure
it'll get you through Austin.

25:20.769 --> 25:24.522
Inside are some shirts and jeans,
and I'm guessing you might be interested

25:24.606 --> 25:26.191
in my old combat boots.

25:26.274 --> 25:29.485
The ones I shined last week?
Shut your face hole!

25:32.363 --> 25:35.701
Yeah. And, um, it's not much,

25:35.784 --> 25:38.244
but it'll buy you a cauldron and a wand.

25:40.747 --> 25:42.082
I'm gonna miss this.

25:42.165 --> 25:43.709
I'm gonna miss this, too.

25:45.961 --> 25:50.006
Mmm. But know that you'll always have
a place to park your broom.

25:54.302 --> 25:56.262
-You know...
-[sniffling and crying]

25:57.430 --> 25:58.682
This is like...

25:59.391 --> 26:02.269
when I had to say goodbye
to my friends in Cuba.

26:03.812 --> 26:08.024
And my  papi  said,
"Keep it together for your  mami,

26:08.108 --> 26:09.735
or she will be so upset."

26:10.902 --> 26:14.906
And then my  mami  said,
"Keep it together for your  papi."

26:16.199 --> 26:19.535
So... be a good friend, mmm?

26:20.453 --> 26:23.206
Think how difficult this must be for her.

26:25.750 --> 26:26.876
Sé fuerte.

26:28.336 --> 26:29.546
[knock on door]

26:32.423 --> 26:34.801
-Hey, Schneider.
-Hi.

26:34.885 --> 26:38.471
Thanks for taking me to the airport...
and for buying the ticket.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.682
God bless white guilt.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.479
Or is it Canadian goodness?

26:46.562 --> 26:48.314
[in heavy Canadian accent]
Well, a little of both, eh?

26:48.398 --> 26:49.650
[in American accent] Damn it!

26:51.651 --> 26:53.403
Here you go. On me.

26:54.404 --> 26:57.532
Well, on the weird blonde lady
who forgot to take them home.

26:59.826 --> 27:00.702
Thanks, Alex.

27:07.542 --> 27:08.543
Thank you,  señora.

27:14.674 --> 27:16.176
I'll text you from the airport.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.219
Text me from Schneider's car.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.388
You know I will.

27:20.471 --> 27:21.597
[both crying]

27:34.485 --> 27:35.946
[sniffles]

27:37.322 --> 27:39.574
I thought you said I was supposed
to keep it together!

27:39.657 --> 27:41.576
[both crying]

27:41.659 --> 27:43.494
Well, that's you.

27:45.955 --> 27:47.457
[crying] We can do whatever we want.
