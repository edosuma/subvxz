00:09.943 --> 00:12.434
Mmm.

00:14.314 --> 00:17.181
Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Ha!

00:22.622 --> 00:24.852
Hmm.

00:59.459 --> 01:03.452
Hey, who cut out <i>Beetle Bailey?</i>
I need my Miss Buxley fix.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.622
I don't like you ogling her.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.996
Why don't you read <i>Cathy?</i>
She's hilarious.

01:08.101 --> 01:10.001
Eh, too much baggage.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.003
Whoo, my horoscope!

01:12.105 --> 01:15.097
- Today you will die."
- What?

01:15.208 --> 01:19.235
" And you may get a compliment
from an attractive coworker"!

01:19.345 --> 01:21.973
- Lenny?
- It really says "die"?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.710
That sounds unusually specific
for a horoscope.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.378
Maybe I better check mine.

01:27.487 --> 01:30.115
"Today your husband will die"!

01:30.223 --> 01:32.350
Homer, I'm scared.

01:32.459 --> 01:36.225
Ooh! Scary newspaper.
Don't hurt me, horoscope. I'm afraid-

01:36.329 --> 01:39.196
Ow! Oh! Paper cut!
Paper cut!

01:42.635 --> 01:44.796
Missed me!

01:44.904 --> 01:47.065
Stupid horoscope.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.812
Stupid horoscope!

01:57.016 --> 02:00.645
"Cloopid blorapope."

02:03.790 --> 02:07.351
- Homer, if I may compliment you-
- Yes. Go on.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.691
That is one handsome rattlesnake
you got bitin' your arm there.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.994
Yeah, it's quite fetching. But, uh,
aren't you worried about the deadliness?

02:14.100 --> 02:16.967
Nah, he'll get tired of bitin' in an hour or so.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.265
Snakes- nature's quitters.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.434
That horoscope was baloney.
Nothing happened except for...

02:23.543 --> 02:26.512
the pickax in my head, the rattlesnake bite
and the testicle thing.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.946
- What's for dessert?
- No dessert until you eat your broccoli.

02:30.049 --> 02:33.348
Oh, fine.

02:39.359 --> 02:41.987
Mmm. Another broccoli-related death.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.063
- But I thought broccoli was-
- Oh, yes.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.064
One of the deadliest plants on earth.

02:46.166 --> 02:50.034
Why, it tries to warn you itself
with its terrible taste.

02:50.136 --> 02:52.502
Sure is easy when
they're stiff like this.

02:53.540 --> 02:56.008
And very sad.

03:03.149 --> 03:04.844
Saint Peter! Whoo-hoo!

03:04.951 --> 03:07.977
Got to heaven before you, Flanders!

03:08.087 --> 03:09.987
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

03:10.089 --> 03:12.683
I wouldn't celebrate
so soon, Mr. Simpson.

03:12.792 --> 03:16.023
I don't see a single
good deed next to your name.

03:16.129 --> 03:20.190
Well, the thing about that is, um-

03:20.300 --> 03:22.564
Ow! Oh!

03:22.669 --> 03:26.469
Homer, settle down. I'll give you
a chance to get into heaven.

03:26.573 --> 03:30.566
You have 24 hours to go back
and do one good deed.

03:30.677 --> 03:33.145
I'm sorry. I didn't get the number
of hours or good deeds.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.187
Oh, Homie. I still can't believe
a piece of broccoli killed you.

03:43.289 --> 03:46.053
What the hell was I thinking?

03:52.498 --> 03:54.125
I tried the broccoli again.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.964
You have 23 hours left.

04:01.140 --> 04:05.133
Marge Simpson.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.976
Homer, it's you! I thought
I'd never see you again.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.313
You were wrong.
Dead wrong.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.319
- Do you have to talk like that?
- No, not really.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.652
Marge, you gotta help me. I have to do
one good deed to get into heaven.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.022
Well, I've got
a whole list of chores-

04:21.127 --> 04:23.493
Clean the garage, paint the house,
grout the ti-

04:23.596 --> 04:26.724
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm just trying to get in.
I'm not running forJesus.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.994
Okay, good deed, good deed.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.195
Hello!

04:32.605 --> 04:35.130
<i>Hey, a chance for a good deed!</i>

04:35.241 --> 04:37.334
Huh?

04:38.578 --> 04:39.875
No! She's mine!

04:39.979 --> 04:41.469
- Oh, my Lord!
- Hey!

04:41.581 --> 04:44.106
Wha-Wha-Wha-
What's happening to me?

04:44.217 --> 04:46.276
People can see up my bustle!

04:46.386 --> 04:48.684
Hey, stop squirming.

04:50.423 --> 04:54.757
Uh-oh. I'm pretty sure
she was gonna be the next Hitler.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.829
Hello? Good deed done.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.024
Let's see. Good deed.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.370
Gotta find a good deed.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.905
Ha-ha!

05:08.007 --> 05:10.601
- Bingo!
- #Your dad is dead #

05:10.710 --> 05:12.769
# Mine's just in jail ##

05:12.879 --> 05:15.905
Nelson!

05:16.015 --> 05:19.451
- Huh? Who said that?
- I am the ghost-

05:19.552 --> 05:22.988
- Gotcha! Ha-ha!
- Bart, help!

05:28.628 --> 05:32.621
Just one minute left to get into heaven.
There's gotta be some good deed I can do.

05:32.732 --> 05:35.223
Come on. Think, think!

05:37.603 --> 05:39.628
My baby!

05:39.739 --> 05:42.230
Stop that crying!

05:42.342 --> 05:45.106
Man, you're annoying!

05:49.982 --> 05:52.917
Oh, it's a miracle!
Thank heavens!

05:53.019 --> 05:54.486
Whoo-hoo!

05:56.155 --> 05:58.680
Did you see that?
I did the deed. Open up!

05:58.791 --> 06:01.282
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I wasn't looking.

06:01.394 --> 06:03.692
Hey, I thought you guys
could see everything.

06:03.796 --> 06:07.197
- No. You're thinking of Santa Claus.
- Well, I'll be damned.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.064
I'm afraid so, yes.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.131
Ooh.

06:16.242 --> 06:19.439
I am Homer Simpson-

06:19.545 --> 06:24.778
Silence, sinner!
Prepare for an eternity of horrible pain!

06:24.884 --> 06:26.909
Oh, no! Oh!

06:27.019 --> 06:30.648
Ha-ha!

06:30.757 --> 06:33.590
Oh, be quiet!
You'll wake upJohn Wayne.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.661
I'm already up.

06:44.404 --> 06:48.101
Son, I don't like you watching that fire.
It's too violent.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.611
You're missing the best part, Sister.
Forget that stupid book.

06:54.714 --> 06:58.150
But these fairy tales take me away
from the harsh reality of peasant life.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.878
Aw, it's not so bad.

06:59.986 --> 07:02.079
Ow!

07:02.188 --> 07:04.554
Oh! I just got over the plague.

07:04.657 --> 07:07.751
Hello, Wife.
Hello, children.

07:08.961 --> 07:12.761
Who's up for a merry jig?

07:12.865 --> 07:16.028
Uh- Uh- Ow!
Oh! Who am I kidding?

07:16.135 --> 07:18.160
I'm not merry.

07:19.238 --> 07:21.934
- I lost my job as an oaf today.
- What?

07:22.041 --> 07:23.474
Oh! Why are the oafs
always the first to go?

07:30.516 --> 07:32.143
- Maybe you could be a dunce, Father.
- Really?

07:32.251 --> 07:32.979
Hey!

07:33.085 --> 07:34.484
What do you think?
Do you love it?

07:37.156 --> 07:41.058
Oh, I'm no dunce! I was born an oaf
and I'll die an oaf.

07:41.160 --> 07:44.960
But, Husband, without your weekly pittance,
how shall we feed our children?

07:45.064 --> 07:48.761
Don't worry. No child
will ever starve in my home.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.234
<i>So long, kids!</i>

07:51.337 --> 07:54.238
Enjoy your new home!

07:54.340 --> 07:56.331
Say "hi" to your other brother and sister.

07:57.743 --> 08:01.144
"Other brother and sister"?

08:01.247 --> 08:03.477
Face it. They're not great parents.

08:05.852 --> 08:09.219
No! That bridge has a troll under it!

08:09.322 --> 08:11.415
Everything in this forest
is from a fairy tale...

08:11.524 --> 08:14.584
and this book can keep us
one step ahead.

08:15.962 --> 08:18.487
Aw, geez. I came on
too strong again.

08:18.598 --> 08:21.066
Oh, I'm so desperately lonely.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.267
Hello!
Lost lovable orphans!

08:34.113 --> 08:37.014
Hmm. Bowls of porridge.

08:37.116 --> 08:40.517
Oh, this seems somehow familiar.
Let's see.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.087
Hmm.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.450
Oh! Whoa! Too hot.

08:43.556 --> 08:46.491
Mmm, hmm. Oh. Too cold.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.526
Well, this doesn't take a genius.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.025
- Mmm.
- We're in the three bears' house!

09:03.643 --> 09:06.441
That was close.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.446
I wonder where Goldilocks was.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.914
Oh!

09:11.017 --> 09:13.747
That bed was <i>just</i> right!

09:15.621 --> 09:17.851
Oh, no!

09:27.033 --> 09:30.799
Boy, dumping your kids in the forest
sure gets your hands dusty.

09:30.903 --> 09:34.168
What? You threw our precious babies
into the woods?

09:34.273 --> 09:36.605
We could've sold them!

09:36.709 --> 09:39.439
- Go back and get them!
- Here's a better idea.

09:39.545 --> 09:42.810
I know how we can replace those children.

09:42.915 --> 09:47.011
Son! Daughter!
I'm ever so sorry!

09:47.119 --> 09:52.853
<i># La, la, la-la, la</i>
<i>la-la, la #</i>

09:52.959 --> 09:56.861
Brave sir knight! I pray you,
climb up and rescue me!

09:59.966 --> 10:02.901
- Hmm. Hmm.
- Ow! No! Wait!

10:03.002 --> 10:06.233
<i>Wait!</i>

10:09.575 --> 10:11.543
Hmm.

10:11.644 --> 10:14.738
Wow! A house made of gingerbread.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.749
Come on in, my darlings.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.943
The best candies are inside.

10:20.052 --> 10:23.818
Wait! Let me check the book.

10:23.923 --> 10:27.882
- Ah, she seems nice.
I'm gonna go with my gut and trust her.
- You're probably right.

10:32.732 --> 10:35.963
Sweep faster! It's almost
time for your beating!

10:36.068 --> 10:38.332
Oh, this is horrible!

10:38.437 --> 10:40.871
Horribly delicious.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.806
You know, she's only fattening
you up so she can eat you.

10:43.909 --> 10:45.877
Eh. What are you gonna do?

10:47.213 --> 10:49.738
- Well, at least stop basting yourself.
- Mmm.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.545
Stop your chattering and sweep!
This house is filthy!

10:52.652 --> 10:56.281
- So what do you care? It's not like you have friends.
- I have a boyfriend.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.856
- Sure.
- Yeah, right.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.482
- What? I do!
- Oh, yeah? What's his name?

11:00.593 --> 11:03.994
Uh, George... Cauldron.

11:04.096 --> 11:08.294
George Cauldron? Maybe he
can fix me up with Ed Ladle.

11:10.469 --> 11:13.529
That's it! Into the oven with you!

11:15.941 --> 11:17.841
- Ah!
- What?

11:19.145 --> 11:21.579
Mmm. Sugar walls.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.979
Father, I knew you'd rescue us!

11:24.083 --> 11:26.847
Oh, rescue you, stuff myself with candy-
It's all good.

11:28.921 --> 11:30.582
Oh, that's a load-bearing candy cane,
you clumsy oaf!

11:36.929 --> 11:37.657
Ha!

11:42.234 --> 11:45.203
Ooh. Huh?

11:45.304 --> 11:47.135
Yah!
Aw.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.208
Ah, is that all you got?
Huh? Huh?

11:53.379 --> 11:55.506
Mmm, fish.

11:55.614 --> 12:00.108
Oh, no! That's me!
Get me out of here! Get- Get- Get out-

12:00.219 --> 12:02.653
Just a minute!

12:04.657 --> 12:08.457
Oh, God, no!

12:08.561 --> 12:13.157
<i>Let me out! I couldn't be in more pain!</i>

12:13.265 --> 12:15.563
Ah! Ah!

12:15.668 --> 12:17.693
Oh!

12:18.738 --> 12:20.638
Uh, hello.
I'm George Cauldron.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.971
- Is Suzanne ready yet?
- Almost. Just give her another 20 minutes.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.610
Yeah, but the concert's at 8:00.

12:28.714 --> 12:31.182
Mmm. Mmm.

12:31.283 --> 12:35.481
Well, we're still poor. But thanks to
your father, we'll never go hungry.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.419
Speaking of which,
how about seconds?

12:37.523 --> 12:40.083
Comin' up!

13:00.780 --> 13:03.271
Let's give Snorky a big hand!

13:03.382 --> 13:05.247
<i>Whoo! Yea, Snorky!</i>

13:05.351 --> 13:09.685
Now we're gonna need a volunteer to frolic
with Snorky. So raise your hand if you wanna be-

13:18.964 --> 13:19.862
Oh, Snorky.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.865
Folks, we're heating up the lobster tank...

13:21.967 --> 13:24.231
<i>so hurry on over if you want to pet 'em</i>
<i>before you eat 'em.</i>

13:26.438 --> 13:28.338
It's okay.
They're gone now.

13:28.440 --> 13:30.533
You could- Hey, where you going?

13:36.849 --> 13:40.683
Oh. You want to be with your friends.

13:42.888 --> 13:45.618
Uh-

13:45.724 --> 13:47.419
Oh.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.432
It's getting away.
Kill it!

13:55.534 --> 13:58.697
Go on! Swim to freedom! Go!

14:05.211 --> 14:09.079
Ahh!

14:12.418 --> 14:15.649
Ew, yech!

14:45.517 --> 14:47.417
Ah! Mmm.

14:47.519 --> 14:51.148
Alcohol and night swimming.
It's a winning combination.

14:56.061 --> 14:59.622
Ooh. Uh-oh. Sharks-
the assassins of the sea!

14:59.732 --> 15:01.859
Ooh. Hey, you're not sharks.

15:01.967 --> 15:05.232
You're dolphins-
the clowns of the sea.

15:05.337 --> 15:08.465
Ow! Ow!
Hey, what's the gag?

15:11.076 --> 15:14.637
Ooh! Ooh!

15:19.451 --> 15:23.820
Hmm. Bottlenose bruises,
blowhole burns, flipper-prints.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.290
This looks like the work of rowdy teens.
Lou, cancel the prom.

15:30.429 --> 15:34.365
Arr! It begins.
The dolphins are upon us.

15:34.466 --> 15:39.403
And only this old sea dog
knows how to stop the-Arr!

15:42.141 --> 15:44.837
Rarr!

16:30.155 --> 16:33.386
Two Krusty shakes,
a doughnut burger with cheese...

16:33.492 --> 16:35.653
and a party-size bucket of flan.

16:38.197 --> 16:40.597
Yes, I will have fries with that.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.200
Anything to get out of work.

16:48.607 --> 16:51.041
Killer dolphins.

16:51.143 --> 16:54.203
- Killer dolphins?
- The recent "wave" of murders-

16:58.283 --> 17:01.218
Um, di-did I say killer dolphins?

17:01.320 --> 17:03.447
I meant killer Italians.

17:03.555 --> 17:06.887
Gray, bottlenosed,
intelligent Italians.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.893
Intelligent Italians?
Something's wrong.

17:09.994 --> 17:12.292
It's dolphins. We have to stop them.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.458
If we speak in low-frequency voices,
I don't think they can-

17:15.567 --> 17:17.467
Ow!

17:18.737 --> 17:21.762
Those dolphins seem bent on mayhem.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.569
We've gotta warn Grampa!

17:25.978 --> 17:27.877
Hmm.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.278
Phone's off the hook.
Everything must be okay.

17:34.586 --> 17:37.555
Aw, I'm gonna give your liver
such a punchin'!

17:40.359 --> 17:43.658
People, please!
We're all frightened and horny.

17:43.762 --> 17:48.290
But we can't let some killer dolphins
keep us from living and scoring!

17:51.437 --> 17:54.668
Willie, must you do that now?

17:54.773 --> 17:58.436
Ach! You want streaks? 'Cause if you
interrupt me, that's what you'll get!

17:58.544 --> 18:00.774
Oh.

18:13.525 --> 18:16.961
- It's approaching the podium!
- <i>Surely it cannot speak!</i>

18:18.097 --> 18:22.193
Snorky... talk... man.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.203
I'm sorry. Let me start over.

18:26.305 --> 18:29.240
Eons ago, dolphins
lived on the land.

18:29.341 --> 18:31.241
What did he say?

18:31.343 --> 18:34.005
- He said dolphins used to live on the land.
- Whaaa-

18:34.113 --> 18:37.674
Then your ancestors drove us
into the sea...

18:37.783 --> 18:39.808
where we've suffered
for millions of years.

18:39.918 --> 18:43.752
But you seemed so happy in the ocean.
All that playful leaping-

18:43.856 --> 18:48.520
We were trying to get out. It's cold,
it's wet. Every morning I wake up phlegmy.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.528
- Plus all that sewage we keep dumping.
- That was you?

18:51.630 --> 18:54.394
It was her, all right!
Take the one who wronged you.

18:54.500 --> 18:59.301
I, King Snorky, hereby banish
all humans to the sea!

19:01.273 --> 19:03.036
Yeah!

19:03.142 --> 19:06.043
<i>Pushy dolphins.</i>

19:06.145 --> 19:09.171
- L-l-I tuned out. Where-Where we going?
- <i>Wait! Stop!</i>

19:09.281 --> 19:13.115
We can outsmart those dolphins!
Don't forget we invented computers...

19:13.218 --> 19:15.686
leg warmers, bendy straws,
peel-and-eat shrimp...

19:15.787 --> 19:18.255
the glory hole and the pudding cup.

19:18.357 --> 19:23.590
I'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping
tuna-munchers push me around!

19:23.695 --> 19:26.664
Uh-oh.

19:36.642 --> 19:40.601
Geez. So many dolphins.

19:52.257 --> 19:56.387
Oh, no. You poor thing.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.725
Here. Ow! Son of a-

19:58.830 --> 20:02.163
Hey, leave my daughter alone!
Come on, humans!

20:02.267 --> 20:05.725
We've wiped out entire species before!
We can do it again!

20:15.147 --> 20:17.513
Oh, help!

20:17.616 --> 20:19.106
Ooh! If I could just- Ooh!

20:19.218 --> 20:20.378
This is really not- Ooh!
You're hurting my- Ooh!

20:32.898 --> 20:37.028
Come on, lads! Let's drive 'em
back to the ocean!

20:46.511 --> 20:49.810
Well, you gotta hand it to those dolphins.
They just wanted it more.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.748
I kinda wish I hadn't freed
their leader and, you know-

20:52.851 --> 20:55.479
Doomed mankind.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.078
Oh, honey, I wouldn't say "doomed."

20:58.190 --> 21:01.682
It's gonna be an adjustment,
no question. But- Ugh!

21:09.635 --> 21:14.334
Can you believe it, Kodos?
They left us out of the Halloween show!

21:14.439 --> 21:17.931
Are you sure the space-phone
is working?

21:18.043 --> 21:21.774
Hang up. They could be trying to call right now!

21:21.880 --> 21:24.041
I knew we should've
sent them a muffin basket.

21:26.151 --> 21:28.711
Kang and Kodos Productions.

21:28.820 --> 21:32.950
Uh-huh. Yes.
Just a second.

21:33.058 --> 21:36.960
Do we want to do a commercial
for something called "Old Navy"?

21:37.062 --> 21:39.030
Eh, work is work.
