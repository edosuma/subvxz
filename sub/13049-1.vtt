ALLYSON:<i> The rumors have been</i>
<i>out of control</i>

00:08.520 --> 00:10.400
<i>ever since the night</i>
<i>of the final competition.</i>

00:10.840 --> 00:14.840
<i>Some people think Danny ran away,</i>
<i>that he's in hiding.</i>

00:14.920 --> 00:18.080
<i>Others think he never</i>
<i>existed in the first place.</i>

00:18.360 --> 00:20.440
<i>But believe me, he is real.</i>

00:20.680 --> 00:23.280
I know.
I was there.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.520
(SIGHS)

00:26.280 --> 00:31.040
Some of what I witnessed
was pretty terrifying.

00:33.760 --> 00:39.760
I saw things that were so strange,
so unexpected.

00:41.640 --> 00:45.760
Well, as much as I like to think
I'm a champion puzzle solver,

00:47.680 --> 00:52.480
even I still haven't figured out
exactly how it all went down.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.200
But one thing I am sure of,

00:58.320 --> 01:01.680
Danny Sinclair is definitely real,

01:02.360 --> 01:05.160
and unlike anybody you've ever met.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.680
Oh, and also,
what I'm about to show you

01:11.760 --> 01:14.120
was never, ever meant to be seen.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.240
ALLYSON:<i> I was hired to be a segment</i>
<i>producer of a new reality TV show,</i>

01:26.480 --> 01:29.960
<i>assigned to make sure</i>
<i>every bit of action got caught on tape.</i>

01:30.040 --> 01:34.360
MS. McALLISTER: Everybody take a seat,
please. Thank you.

01:35.560 --> 01:40.560
As thrilled as we are that this
is the first show in television history

01:40.640 --> 01:43.280
to be produced entirely by kids,

01:43.360 --> 01:45.400
not all of you will remain.

01:45.520 --> 01:49.680
Only those who discover
one of the three final magicians

01:50.280 --> 01:52.560
will stay with us
through the grand finale.

01:52.720 --> 01:53.760
Think you're all up for it?

01:53.880 --> 01:55.560
Oh, definitely!

01:56.000 --> 01:58.080
-Good.
-(AMUSED MURMURING)

01:58.200 --> 01:59.200
What's she doin', man?

02:02.560 --> 02:04.000
Thank you. (CHUCKLES)

02:04.400 --> 02:08.560
Before we proceed,
what is the single most important rule

02:08.640 --> 02:09.760
for making good television?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.040
Oh!

02:11.240 --> 02:13.360
Make sure they spell your name right
in the credits.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.400
Yeah. Yes.
And you are?

02:15.520 --> 02:18.680
Allyson Miller. I think the most important
rule of good television

02:18.880 --> 02:20.840
is to always keep your camera rolling.

02:20.920 --> 02:21.920
Excellent.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.440
I couldn't have said it better myself.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.200
Actually, you did.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.400
I remembered it from a quote

02:26.480 --> 02:30.200
you gave in an interview
with <i>TV Weekly.</i> October of 2002.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.720
Well, it's nice to know
one of you came prepared.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.560
And now it is my pleasure
to introduce you

02:37.640 --> 02:40.120
to someone
I'm sure you are all familiar with.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.520
He is both
a world-renowned magician

02:42.640 --> 02:46.080
and the host of our new
reality television show.

02:46.160 --> 02:50.280
Please welcome the amazing Mystic Max.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.280
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

02:56.240 --> 02:59.560
Thank you.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

02:59.640 --> 03:04.360
One hundred talented magicians
between the ages of 10 and 16

03:04.440 --> 03:06.600
became eligible for our show

03:06.680 --> 03:09.880
by figuring out the hidden message
in this poster.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.520
It appeared on billboards,
in magazines,

03:13.600 --> 03:16.280
in newspapers and on the Internet.

03:16.880 --> 03:21.760
Hidden somewhere in this ad
is a secret message.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.960
Just out of curiosity, did any one of you
find the hidden message?

03:26.800 --> 03:28.840
-Allyson?
-Big surprise.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.080
Would you care to show us?

03:30.800 --> 03:31.840
Aw.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.560
Well, as we all know,

03:36.640 --> 03:40.800
magicians say the secret
to any good trick is misdirection.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.040
That means they're trying
to get you to focus over here

03:43.120 --> 03:45.840
while they do some
hocus pocus over there.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.200
So, most people probably thought
the clues would be found

03:49.280 --> 03:50.720
in the magician and his trick,

03:50.800 --> 03:52.320
because that's what first draws your eye.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.960
But truth is, it's the background things
you need to focus on.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.080
See, the spider web made me realize

03:59.160 --> 04:01.520
it was probably there
to direct us to a website.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.880
Then, on looking closer
at the book the statue is holding,

04:04.960 --> 04:07.240
I saw that it was<i> A Farewell to Arms,</i>

04:07.320 --> 04:09.520
and then, bam, it hit me!

04:09.720 --> 04:12.080
I mean, everybody knows
that the <i>Venus de Milo</i>

04:12.160 --> 04:13.440
is a statue with no arms.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.440
-Sure.
-And that made me think

04:15.520 --> 04:17.680
of the famous founder
of the Magic Mansion,

04:17.760 --> 04:20.320
a magician named Antonio DeMilo.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.120
I mean, how obvious could it be?

04:25.240 --> 04:26.600
This is a joke, right?

04:26.680 --> 04:28.760
I went online, typed in "demilo.net"

04:28.840 --> 04:31.360
and got linked directly
to the contest entry form.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.080
Simple, right?

04:33.240 --> 04:34.320
(ALL GIGGLE)

04:34.480 --> 04:35.720
Well done, Allyson.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.360
Oh...

04:39.080 --> 04:40.080
Thanks.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.280
Know-it-all.

04:45.320 --> 04:48.480
ALLYSON: <i>Okay, so I'm not the best</i>
<i>at making friends.</i>

04:48.960 --> 04:51.040
I know I can seem like
a bit of a know-it-all,

04:51.120 --> 04:52.760
but I really don't mean to.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.440
It's not my fault people ask me questions
and I have answers.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.000
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

04:57.080 --> 05:00.040
Hey, I'd love it if kids my own age
could actually relate to me.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.520
I mean, I've tried pretending
I'm into lip gloss

05:02.600 --> 05:04.480
and text messaging
and hanging out at the mall.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.520
I just can't ever seem
to pull it off.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.480
Okay, sorry.
What got me off on that rant?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.120
I have no idea.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.840
Seriously, I'm not the story here.
Danny is.

05:18.320 --> 05:20.560
ALLYSON:<i> Ms. McAllister divided us</i>
<i>into teams.</i>

05:20.640 --> 05:23.960
<i>Each team had a kid producer,</i>
<i>a kid cameraperson,</i>

05:24.040 --> 05:25.960
<i>and an adult mentor.</i>

05:26.120 --> 05:27.680

-Peace.

<i>...and our mentor,</i>
<i>whose name was Paul.</i>

05:31.720 --> 05:33.200
<i>We were sent to</i>
<i>find the one kid</i>

05:33.280 --> 05:35.280
<i>who could best represent</i>
<i>his region on the show.</i>

05:35.360 --> 05:36.720
That's good work, people, good work.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.400
<i>We had no idea</i>
<i>what we were in for.</i>

05:38.520 --> 05:41.120
Okay, good luck, everybody.
Let's do this.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.640
Come on. Hey!

05:48.360 --> 05:49.760
-Hi. Are you Blake?
-Yes, I am.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.400
Hi, I'm Allyson.
Nice to meet you.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.560
Nice to meet you.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.120
We're with
the <i>World's Greatest</i> audition.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.280
-Sweet!
-Yeah! You ready to show us what you got?

05:56.360 --> 05:58.200
-Yeah, let's go.
-Okay, let's do it.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.840
<i>World's Greatest Magician,</i>
contestant number one.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.720
Action!

06:04.080 --> 06:06.720
Don't take it easy on me.
Get it super tight.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.040
Good luck, buddy.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.040
I present

06:14.440 --> 06:18.280
Siegfried as dog gone!

06:18.680 --> 06:21.040
Okay, now be prepared to be astounded

06:21.120 --> 06:23.800
as I show you the card you just picked.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.320
Ta-da!

06:27.600 --> 06:29.680
Well, um... No.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.400
The astonishing linking rings.

ALLYSON: Um...

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
Ryan?

06:53.680 --> 06:56.480
Okay, I'm positive that this is your card.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.760
No.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.320
-This your card?
-No.

-(DOG BARKING)

07:18.240 --> 07:19.520
This one. This one!

07:19.600 --> 07:20.600
This one?

07:23.640 --> 07:25.960
First, I take an egg,

07:26.440 --> 07:29.480
crack it into the hat,
add some flour

07:29.560 --> 07:31.160
and a little milk.

07:31.480 --> 07:36.080
After I stir it all up
and place it on your head,

07:36.800 --> 07:37.960
a cake will magically...

07:38.040 --> 07:39.320
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

07:39.840 --> 07:44.400
-...appear.
-You forgot the rubber cake.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.520
Oops.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.920
Okay. So, basically,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.800
I could describe
my contestants in two words.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.880
Impressively pathetic.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.080
Bummer, right?

08:05.160 --> 08:08.560
If I didn't find someone
who was cool enough to put on the show,

08:08.720 --> 08:10.960
my first chance
at a career was gonna be over

08:11.040 --> 08:12.920
before it ever started.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.440
Cedric and I were down to our last hope.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.440
(GROANS)

08:27.120 --> 08:28.120
Hey!

08:31.480 --> 08:33.200
Okay, this better be good.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.720
-Hi. Nice to meet you people.
-Hi.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.800
-Hi, we're the Sinclairs.
-Nice to meet you.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.680
We're so glad you're here.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.520
Yeah. This is all Danny's
been talking about for weeks.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.720
-Great, good, awesome, perfect, yeah.
-That's cool.

08:52.880 --> 08:56.080
He's been very,
very anxious to meet you people.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.920
Please come in. Yeah.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.400
Oh, okay.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.040
(DANNY BLOWING AIR)

09:31.000 --> 09:32.240
Hello.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.080
Uh...

09:39.720 --> 09:41.320
Hi. Uh, Danny.

Hi. Um, Allyson.
Nice to meet you.

-I'm Danny. Welcome.

09:47.800 --> 09:49.000
Ready to show us what you got?

09:50.920 --> 09:52.080
Only one way to find out.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.360
Contestant number 10, Danny Sinclair.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.920
And action.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.920
One, two,

10:06.200 --> 10:07.440
three!

10:09.800 --> 10:12.240
Let me guess.
The incredible popping balloon?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.160
No, no.
See, what's supposed to happen

10:14.240 --> 10:17.080
is I pop the balloon and a dove flies out.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.560
I've done it a million times.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.240
-Okay.
-Just let me try it again, okay?

10:21.480 --> 10:23.040
Be my guest.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.160
Okay. One, two,

10:27.240 --> 10:28.360
three!

10:30.240 --> 10:33.760
All right, one more time.
One more time.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.120
All right. One, two,

10:37.040 --> 10:38.160
three!

10:41.320 --> 10:44.200
All right, next time...
Next time for sure. Next time for sure.

10:44.280 --> 10:45.680
You know,
maybe you want to try a different trick.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.760
No, I can do this, all right?
I can do this.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.240
You need any help?
You want an assistant?

10:49.320 --> 10:50.640
I mean, we could always
try a different camera...

10:50.720 --> 10:53.120
I'm gonna do it, all right?
You just gotta back off

10:55.000 --> 10:57.040
and give me another chance.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.080
This really matters to you, huh?

11:02.560 --> 11:04.800
More than you can possibly know.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.480
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

11:11.440 --> 11:13.280
I seriously need for it to happen, too.

11:15.840 --> 11:16.960
You're my last chance.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.360
Yeah, and you're mine, so...

11:21.320 --> 11:23.960
Let's just do this. Okay? This time...

11:25.200 --> 11:27.920
This time it's definitely,
definitely going to work.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.120

-No, no, no, wait a minute,

11:57.840 --> 11:59.040
please, I can do this.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.640
I bet the only reason
we did a bajillion takes

12:15.720 --> 12:17.680
was because
Allyson thinks the guy's cute.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.920
The only reason I did
a bajillion takes

12:20.000 --> 12:22.160
was because our
other nine magicians really stunk.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.720
I can't believe
I'm gonna be off the show.

Hey, now you don't know that.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.440
One of our magicians
could still get picked.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.880
You seriously think so?

12:30.960 --> 12:32.120
(CHUCKLING) No!

12:32.280 --> 12:34.920
But as your mentor
I'm supposed to be encouraging.

Whoa!

12:44.240 --> 12:45.280
Tell me you're rolling!

Wow, man! This kid is good!

Of course he did. Who else?

But the expression I saw on his face

13:15.040 --> 13:17.440
seemed a whole lot more like

13:18.280 --> 13:19.280
fear.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.960
You're right, Allyson.
Very impressive.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.520
Very impressive indeed.

13:28.520 --> 13:29.920
-Yes!
-Yes!

13:30.800 --> 13:32.760
I told you it was unbelievable.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.400
Yeah, a little too unbelievable.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.840
What are you saying, Hunter?

13:35.920 --> 13:37.840
Isn't it obvious?
Her and that Danny kid

13:37.920 --> 13:39.680
must've worked
the whole thing out ahead of time.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.120
They've been scamming us from the start.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.800
-We were not.
-Oh, get real!

13:42.920 --> 13:45.000
There's no way
he pulled that off unless you helped.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.680
Hunter, Allyson
wouldn't do something like that, okay?

13:47.760 --> 13:49.080
She knows the rules.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.000
Colluding with a contestant
is strictly forbidden.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.800
Well, we all know how much she likes
to be the best at everything.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.800
I was there.
I mean, I saw the whole thing.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.640
So what?
He's on her team.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.720
Maybe he's just
as big a cheater as she is.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.080
We didn't cheat, okay?

14:02.160 --> 14:03.640
Yeah, honest. I mean...

14:05.520 --> 14:07.720
Paul, you were there.
What's your assessment?

14:09.400 --> 14:12.440
Honestly?
I think this kid's the real deal.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.800
I guess we found
our last contestant, Max.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.480
Yes! Justice prevailed.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.400
Danny made it onto the show,
which meant that I did, too.

14:24.480 --> 14:29.120
I was going to be a part of the coolest
reality program ever filmed.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.880
I've been thinking a lot about it,

14:30.960 --> 14:33.120
and you know the way you set us up
back at your house with the whole,

14:33.200 --> 14:35.720
"I'm incompetent,
it's all a big disaster" thing

14:35.800 --> 14:37.800
before you completely
blew our mind with the doves,

14:37.880 --> 14:40.640
that would be the perfect approach
to use in the show, too.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.280
It'll catch everybody off guard
and they will love you.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.560
You could come up with
something like that again, right?

14:45.640 --> 14:47.200
Yeah, yeah, sure. Whatever.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.840
Great! And the other thing
we need to talk about is costumes.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.200
I want something
eye-catching but not too flashy,

14:53.280 --> 14:57.200
classy but not
some all-black funeral-guy look.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.840
Ooh! What we really need is
some kind of...

14:58.960 --> 15:00.120
A gimmick!

15:00.200 --> 15:03.200
An exploding wand, a parrot sidekick...

15:03.280 --> 15:05.760
Allyson. All right, pick any card.

15:05.880 --> 15:07.080
Um, okay.

15:07.160 --> 15:08.400
Any card.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.480
-You got it?
-Yeah.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.440
All right, place it right there.

15:11.680 --> 15:12.840
All right, here's what I'm gonna do.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.560
All I want you to do is say, "Jump."

15:14.920 --> 15:16.200
Jump.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.040
Right there.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.800
-Pretty good. I think it's pretty good.
-That's awesome.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.960
Here, here, here.
Why don't you do this? Pick a card.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.040
You want me to pick a card?

15:25.120 --> 15:26.840
Pick a card.
I want you to pick a card.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.080
-All right, memorize it.
-I got it.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.880
Put it back anywhere in the deck.

15:30.560 --> 15:31.560
All right, you got it?

15:31.640 --> 15:32.960
-I got it.
-All right.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.520
Is that your card?

15:38.400 --> 15:39.680
CEDRIC: Awesome, dude!

15:40.320 --> 15:41.440
-That's my card.
-CEDRIC: How'd you do that?

15:41.520 --> 15:42.640
Magic.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.920
That was awesome!

15:44.800 --> 15:46.880
But this whole mopey, brooding thing
you've got going on,

15:46.960 --> 15:49.600
it's seriously not gonna work for TV.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.800
Too boring.

15:58.680 --> 15:59.720
(TRAM BELL DINGS)

16:12.560 --> 16:13.640
Wow.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.400
Yes!

16:31.600 --> 16:33.840
Welcome to the Magic Mansion,

16:33.920 --> 16:37.120
and congratulations
to our three finalists.

16:39.160 --> 16:40.640
It's a real honor to meet you.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.720
I'm Zoe
and I'm from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.000
The honor is mine, Zoe.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.920
I am Brandon.
I'm from San Francisco, CA.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.120
Good to meet you, Brandon.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.800
I'm Danny from Pensacola.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.760
Yes. I've been looking forward
to meeting you, Danny.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.160
I'd like you all to think of this
as your home.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.240
Follow me.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.000
Wow.

17:10.920 --> 17:13.360
In its illustrious history,

17:13.440 --> 17:17.880
a very few select people have ever been
allowed inside this mansion.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.720
That's because every magic secret
known to man,

17:20.800 --> 17:23.000
and a few not yet revealed,

17:23.080 --> 17:25.560
are hidden within these walls.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.280
While here during this competition,

17:27.360 --> 17:31.960
you may use every prop, every book,
every illusion we have,

17:32.040 --> 17:35.040
and I suggest you take advantage of it.

17:35.120 --> 17:39.120
Remember, you never know
how strong your magic is

17:39.200 --> 17:41.120
until you test it.
Good night.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.600
Oh, by the way,

17:45.680 --> 17:48.880
you might want to search your pockets
for your room keys.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.080
ALL: (CONFUSED) What?

17:50.920 --> 17:52.040
Whoa!

17:58.640 --> 18:00.000
Danny?

18:16.480 --> 18:19.520
ALLYSON: Okay, look, Danny, this is how
it's going to be for the next seven days.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.560
You and I are gonna be like this!

18:21.640 --> 18:22.760
I want to know everything about you.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.240
I want to know what you're doing
and what you're thinking

18:24.320 --> 18:25.680
24 hours a day, every day.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.560
Right now I'm thinking
that this is my room.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.040
So?

18:29.120 --> 18:31.080
So I'll see you tomorrow.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.200
Wait a minute.
We're not done talking here.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.720
One of us is.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.440
-You're blocking my door.
-So?

18:37.520 --> 18:40.280
So, can we continue this tomorrow, please?
I have things I need to take care of.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.600
What kind of things?

18:41.720 --> 18:42.960
None of your business!

18:44.200 --> 18:46.480
Danny, I don't think you're getting it.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.600
Everything about you here is my business.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.520
My business is to follow your every move.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.720
Who is this girl?

18:54.160 --> 18:56.600
Look, I've watched, like,
a gazillion hours of these shows,

18:56.680 --> 18:57.800
even the really gross ones,

18:57.880 --> 19:00.000
you know, where they have to dive into
a vat of cockroach larvae...

19:00.080 --> 19:01.600
What's your point?

19:01.680 --> 19:03.200
The contestants who get
the most screen time

19:03.280 --> 19:06.320
are the ones who are wildly charismatic,
extremely competitive

19:06.400 --> 19:09.320
and have usually overcome
some heartbreaking obstacle to get here.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.120
Well, right now the only heartbreaking
obstacle in my life is you.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.080
Oh, come on! Please?
We're a team.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.480
Oh, yeah?
Then how about a team cheer?

19:17.560 --> 19:19.760
Like, "Go, team, go!"

19:21.280 --> 19:22.640
(LAUGHS)

19:26.480 --> 19:28.320
Danny, you're not funny! Open up!

19:31.440 --> 19:34.080
Look, there's things
about me you're not gonna understand

19:34.160 --> 19:35.400
no matter how much we talk.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.760
So how about we make a deal?

19:37.840 --> 19:40.400
I promise I will do whatever
I can to win this thing for you,

19:40.480 --> 19:44.160
as long as the rest of the time
you leave me alone. All right?

19:44.280 --> 19:45.280
Well, I...

19:45.840 --> 19:50.680
Excuse me, did he seriously think
a bargain like that would stop me?

19:50.960 --> 19:53.080
Ugh! I mean, what was he up to?

19:53.160 --> 19:55.640
And why was he being so mysterious?

19:55.720 --> 19:57.400
As far as I was concerned,

19:57.480 --> 20:00.720
Danny Sinclair was my
favorite kind of challenge,

20:00.800 --> 20:03.200
just one more puzzle
begging to be solved.

20:03.720 --> 20:08.680
My mentor and the founder
of the Magic Mansion, Antonio DeMilo,

20:08.760 --> 20:13.320
was once asked,
"What is a magician's greatest asset?"

20:13.720 --> 20:14.800
And he replied...

20:14.880 --> 20:19.200
"A magician's greatest asset
is the ability to think in unusual ways."

20:19.280 --> 20:21.800
Well, that's very impressive,
Mr. Sinclair.

20:21.960 --> 20:26.480
Yes, the ability to think in unusual ways.

20:26.560 --> 20:30.760
And that is exactly what the nature
of your first challenge entails.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.040
Watch carefully.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.280
A basketball.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.480
-Oh!
-Oh, wow!

20:41.160 --> 20:42.520
A rope.

20:45.240 --> 20:48.680
A broom, a 10-gallon aquarium,

20:49.120 --> 20:51.200
and a bedsheet.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.640
That is cool!

20:56.960 --> 20:59.800
Five very different yet common
household items

20:59.880 --> 21:03.800
and you have exactly 30 minutes
to create an illusion

21:03.880 --> 21:06.920
using any or all of these five objects.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.600
Just those things and nothing else?

21:09.680 --> 21:12.160
Just those things, nothing else.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.480
And the clock is ticking.

21:16.120 --> 21:18.680
I know. It's gonna be dope.
Totally perfect. I'm gonna take the rope.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.480
Where are my cameramen?

21:20.560 --> 21:22.120
There's Cedric.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.920
So, Danny, now that you've done
all this intense

21:26.000 --> 21:28.120
but not very interesting
to watch thinking,

21:28.200 --> 21:30.120
anything you'd like to hop up and show us?

21:30.200 --> 21:32.040
Anything you want to try?

21:32.120 --> 21:35.360
Any probably futile but charming
first attempt you'd care to perform?

21:36.200 --> 21:38.720
Have I mentioned you're making it hard
for me to concentrate?

21:38.800 --> 21:41.520
Okay, maybe you've never watched much TV,

21:41.600 --> 21:44.640
but as I said before it has to be active,
it has to be captivating...

21:44.840 --> 21:47.200
-Where are you going?
-I can't do this.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.480
What do you mean?
No, no, no, you have to do this.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.120
Listen, I shouldn't have came here
in the first place,

21:51.200 --> 21:53.040
especially not if I knew
I'd end up with you.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.120
It might help if you tried
clueing me in, you know.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.240
What's this really about?
Is it stage fright?

21:57.320 --> 21:58.880
Are you freaked out
about having to perform

21:58.960 --> 22:00.360
in front of a bunch of cameras?

22:00.440 --> 22:01.920
If you are, I totally understand.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
Just tell me and we can figure out
how to work on it.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.240
-It's not stage fright.
-Then what?

22:06.320 --> 22:08.640
-I'm only trying to help.
-Yeah, well, you can't.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.240
I'm not the enemy, you know.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.560
Cedric and I are your friends.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.080
Right, Cedric?

22:17.880 --> 22:20.840
Cedric! Attention, please!
Yeah, thanks.

22:20.960 --> 22:21.960
Huh?

22:22.720 --> 22:25.880
I was trying to assure Danny
that he's got whatever support he needs

22:25.960 --> 22:28.680
because you and I are here for him.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.200
Yeah, for sure.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.280
-See?
-Great.

22:32.360 --> 22:33.440
Well, now that we have that established,

22:33.520 --> 22:36.320
let's just cut the chitter-chatter
so I can focus on my trick.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.000
Uh...

22:40.560 --> 22:41.640
Good.

22:46.800 --> 22:50.560
One hundred have tried,
but only three have survived.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.960
<i>And now the stakes get even higher.</i>

22:54.040 --> 22:56.120
<i>Three kids, seven days,</i>

22:56.200 --> 22:58.000
only one winner.

22:58.760 --> 23:02.200
Who will be the world's
greatest kid magician?

23:03.360 --> 23:04.920
The challenge begins.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.560
First up, Zoe from Philadelphia.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.120
She looks great.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.320
Anybody can bounce a basketball,

23:17.400 --> 23:19.400
but how many can do this?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.920
ALLYSON: <i>Zoe's trick was pretty cool.</i>

23:48.000 --> 23:49.120
<i>Max must've thought so, too,</i>

23:49.200 --> 23:52.480
<i>because he gave her</i>
<i>a seven out of a possible 10 points.</i>

23:52.720 --> 23:54.520
<i>Not bad for starters.</i>

23:57.440 --> 24:00.160
<i>And then, it was Danny's turn.</i>

24:01.160 --> 24:02.880
So what are you gonna do?

24:03.120 --> 24:04.680
(EXHALES) Not a clue.

24:04.760 --> 24:06.200
-I'm not laughing.
-Good.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.400
Because neither am I.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.440
A fish tank.

24:23.040 --> 24:24.320
-A basketball.
-Yeah.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.840
A rope, a broom.
Yeah, we know.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.840
Please let him do his trick.

24:30.160 --> 24:31.280
A rope.

24:32.320 --> 24:33.480
Broom.

24:36.920 --> 24:41.240
Don't blink, because all the objects
you see here,

24:41.320 --> 24:43.040
they're...

24:45.520 --> 24:47.280
-They're gonna disappear.
-HUNTER: Right!

24:47.360 --> 24:49.160
You don't stand a snowball's chance
in you-know-where

24:49.240 --> 24:50.280
of pulling that off.

24:50.360 --> 24:53.920
Oh, yeah?
Watch and be amazed.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.400
One,

24:57.320 --> 24:58.560
two,

24:58.960 --> 25:00.040
three.

25:00.880 --> 25:04.360

25:33.800 --> 25:35.600
Wait. You said the contestants

25:35.680 --> 25:38.360
can only use the five original objects,
but he used this.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.840
Yeah! Snow isn't one of the props.

25:40.960 --> 25:42.160
That's ridiculous!

That's what you said.

25:50.720 --> 25:53.600
Yes, the challenge was to think
in unusual ways, Danny,

25:53.680 --> 25:55.720
-and you certainly accomplished that.
-Yes!

25:55.800 --> 25:57.960
But technically speaking, Hunter is right.

25:58.520 --> 26:01.280
You were meant to use five objects only.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.600
So I'm gonna give you a three.

26:05.440 --> 26:06.520
Yes!

26:08.960 --> 26:12.640
Okay, let's clean up the stage.
Brandon, you're next.

I'd like to use an assistant for this.

raise the sheet a bit higher.

I'm not one of your five approved items.

ALLYSON: Now that we're here,
what are we looking for?

38:35.720 --> 38:38.600
Hey, guys, I wonder what this does.

38:38.680 --> 38:39.920
-Cedric, wait!
-No, don't!

38:40.040 --> 38:41.720
(ALL SCREAM)

38:47.480 --> 38:49.040
That was awesome!

38:49.120 --> 38:51.160
Can someone please explain to me
what just happened?

38:51.240 --> 38:53.880
I don't know, but things
just keep getting stranger by the second.

38:53.960 --> 38:55.280
ALLYSON: No kidding.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.040
Let's get out of here.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.200
I hope you're ready
for your next challenge.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.240
(APPLAUSE)

39:09.080 --> 39:11.360
I proudly present to you a classic trick

39:11.440 --> 39:13.440
-invented by Alexander Herrmann...
-Oh, cool.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.480
...but performed by countless
renowned magicians over the years.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.200
They're so cute.

39:31.520 --> 39:32.920
Maybe that one's stuck.

39:46.800 --> 39:50.920
BRANDON: For generations,
Harry Blackstone amazed people

39:51.000 --> 39:53.280
with his levitation of a light bulb.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.680
I will now attempt the same illusion.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.160
Whoa.

40:32.040 --> 40:33.760
-He got an eight.
-That's great.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.480
All right, you're up.

40:41.680 --> 40:44.880
Although Houdini was world-famous
for his incredible escapes,

40:45.000 --> 40:48.800
what you're about to witness was the most
mystifying stage illusion ever.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.480
To this day,
very few people know

40:50.560 --> 40:54.960
how Houdini made a 10,000-pound elephant
vanish in a flash.

40:55.480 --> 40:56.760
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

40:56.880 --> 40:59.200
as I attempt to recreate
this stunning feat,

40:59.280 --> 41:02.560
may I present to you my very own
highly-trained,

41:02.640 --> 41:05.640
yet deadly, dangerous,
wild elephant.

41:08.440 --> 41:09.760
(LAUGHTER)

41:18.160 --> 41:20.320
You know, I might be dressed
like an elephant,

41:20.400 --> 41:22.080
but I feel like a horse's behind.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.120
Get over it. All right?

41:30.040 --> 41:31.360
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

41:31.440 --> 41:34.200
for the first time in over 80 years,

41:34.280 --> 41:37.160
may I present to you Houdini's original...

41:37.240 --> 41:38.560
(BRANDON LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY)

41:38.680 --> 41:40.600
vanishing...

41:41.840 --> 41:43.440
Vanishing elephant.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.160
Hey, hey, Brandon?

42:02.400 --> 42:03.600
You okay?

42:04.120 --> 42:05.240
What...

42:05.840 --> 42:07.440
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

42:07.960 --> 42:11.760
Okay, people! Everybody keep quiet!

42:11.840 --> 42:14.280
Everybody calm down!
One at a time!

42:14.360 --> 42:15.440
He has to be kicked off the show.

42:15.520 --> 42:16.560
You're just jealous!

42:16.640 --> 42:19.040
Your guy levitated
a 60-watt light bulb.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.520
I mean, my guy made
a mechanical bull appear.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.000
That's exactly my point.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.240
There's no way he could do that.

42:24.320 --> 42:27.200
-But he did.
-Okay, how? How did you do it?

42:27.280 --> 42:30.400
A good magician never
reveals the secrets of his tricks.

42:32.560 --> 42:33.920
Or maybe it's because he can't,

42:34.120 --> 42:35.560
because it wasn't a trick.

42:35.960 --> 42:37.360
Then what was it, Hunter?

42:40.080 --> 42:41.280
I...

42:42.560 --> 42:44.800
I think maybe it was real.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.520
(STIFLED GIGGLES)

42:47.160 --> 42:49.040
-Real?
-Yeah. Yeah, you know, like,

42:49.120 --> 42:50.960
what if he actually
has magical powers?

42:52.280 --> 42:56.720
Yeah! Right! Do you have any idea
how crazy you sound?

42:57.160 --> 42:58.400
Look, it's possible, okay?

42:58.480 --> 43:01.800
I mean, there's a lot
of bizarre things we can't explain,

43:01.880 --> 43:03.520
like ESP, mind readers...

43:03.640 --> 43:05.040
And Donald Trump's hair.

43:05.360 --> 43:08.840
Yeah, and people who make
mechanical bulls appear out of thin air.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.640
Exactly! And while we're at it,
I think it was Danny here

43:12.720 --> 43:14.920
who made Brandon disappear
during the first challenge.

43:17.720 --> 43:22.160
Look, as much as I believe it's a total
violation of the magician's code,

43:23.280 --> 43:25.440
why don't you just tell them
how you did your trick

43:25.520 --> 43:27.600
so we can move on?

43:28.400 --> 43:30.000
You heard her, man.
Give it up.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.000
Yeah, come on.
Just tell us all how you did it, okay?

43:32.080 --> 43:33.160
We really want to know.

43:33.240 --> 43:35.920
Okay, fine!
All right, Hunter's right.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.240
I don't know how I did it.

43:38.320 --> 43:40.800
I don't understand
anything about any of this.

43:40.880 --> 43:43.200
These things just happen to me!

43:44.080 --> 43:45.120
Okay, there.
You happy?

43:46.240 --> 43:48.960
Very good, Danny.
That's the ideal answer.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.360
You're really learning
how to play this game, aren't you?

43:52.560 --> 43:53.640
What's that supposed to mean?

43:53.800 --> 43:58.000
Danny just evoked one of the oldest tricks
in the magician's black bag.

43:58.720 --> 44:01.080
I have no idea what you're talking about.

44:01.240 --> 44:03.840
Do you realize how many
classic illusionists

44:03.920 --> 44:06.280
have garnered endless reams of publicity

44:06.360 --> 44:08.640
by claiming to have
actual paranormal powers?

44:08.720 --> 44:10.200
But I'm serious, all right?

44:10.280 --> 44:12.520
I don't know how that
mechanical contraption got there.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.800
Brandon said he felt
like a horse's rear end,

44:14.880 --> 44:16.000
and there it was.

44:16.080 --> 44:17.320
Well, that's very interesting.

44:18.720 --> 44:20.600
So, I suppose you'll have no objection

44:20.720 --> 44:23.880
to my getting together
a group of distinguished experts

44:23.960 --> 44:25.200
to test your claim?

44:25.280 --> 44:27.880
MS. McALLISTER: Well, what sort of experts
are we talking about, Max?

44:28.160 --> 44:31.560
Well, as president
of the Worldwide Skeptics Society,

44:31.720 --> 44:33.240
you might want to start with me.

44:33.720 --> 44:36.000
Worldwide Skeptics?

44:37.280 --> 44:38.360
You?

44:38.440 --> 44:40.280
Surprised? Don't be.

44:40.360 --> 44:42.640
No one knows better than
a professional magician

44:42.720 --> 44:45.120
what nonsense real powers are.

44:45.960 --> 44:48.400
In fact, there's a long,
illustrious history

44:48.480 --> 44:52.200
of true magicians debunking
paranormal pretenders.

44:52.280 --> 44:53.480
Because what we do is,

44:53.560 --> 44:56.480
we provide precisely
practiced entertainment,

44:56.800 --> 45:01.040
and every fraud who comes along
only serves to devalue our skills.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.600
So what do you say, young man?

45:03.720 --> 45:06.720
Would you like to settle this nonsense
once and for all?

45:14.800 --> 45:15.960
Danny!

45:17.200 --> 45:18.880
Are you in there?

45:21.760 --> 45:23.440
ALLYSON:<i> The panel of experts was waiting,</i>

45:23.520 --> 45:25.920

<i>to be found.</i>

45:33.200 --> 45:35.160
<i>Call it my own ESP or whatever,</i>

45:35.600 --> 45:37.720
but after checking every place
I could think of,

45:37.840 --> 45:39.600
I finally found him.

45:40.320 --> 45:41.560
(PAGES RUSTLING)

What are you doing in here?

45:50.800 --> 45:52.280
The panel's waiting.

45:54.480 --> 45:55.640
Danny?

45:57.480 --> 45:58.720
It's no use.
I can't do this.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.200
What? Why not?

46:00.480 --> 46:01.560
'Cause whatever way it ends up,

46:01.640 --> 46:03.520
it's just gonna be
a complete disaster for me.

46:03.680 --> 46:06.160
Why? So far, you've played it perfectly.

46:07.120 --> 46:10.320
Seriously, do you have any idea
what great TV you've been creating?

46:14.200 --> 46:15.840
Wait, you don't...

46:16.520 --> 46:18.560
You don't honestly think
you have real powers, do you?

46:20.080 --> 46:23.360
Look, I need to explain something to you,

46:23.440 --> 46:26.280
but you got to promise me
that you will just sit there quietly

46:26.360 --> 46:28.760
and just let me get through it.

46:28.840 --> 46:30.960
I'll be as silent as a monk.

46:31.320 --> 46:33.120
So, what's the deal?

46:35.640 --> 46:37.680
Come on, you're a smart girl.
Think logically.

46:38.040 --> 46:40.640
How did those doves
appear in your van?

46:40.720 --> 46:42.440
How did Brandon
disappear from a stage

46:42.520 --> 46:43.600
that has no trapdoor?

46:43.680 --> 46:45.280
Nobody's missing
a mechanical bull anywhere,

46:45.360 --> 46:47.880
but yet one totally
appears on our stage?

46:49.040 --> 46:52.560
I mean, do you honestly think
it's because I'm such a great magician?

46:52.760 --> 46:54.640
What are you saying?

46:55.760 --> 46:58.680
Listen, I was serious before, all right?
I'm a freak.

47:00.600 --> 47:01.640
I'm a freak.

47:02.400 --> 47:03.560
Your powers?

47:03.640 --> 47:05.200
Look...

47:06.400 --> 47:09.840
About three years ago,
I was walking to school

47:09.920 --> 47:12.920
and I saw this really cool skateboard
in the store window.

47:13.280 --> 47:16.920
And I was thinking to myself
how much I wanted that thing.

47:18.200 --> 47:21.360
Two seconds later,
it's under my feet and I'm riding it.

47:21.640 --> 47:22.640
It just appeared?

47:22.720 --> 47:24.840
No, no.
It didn't just appear.

47:24.920 --> 47:26.080
Okay? I made it appear.

47:26.560 --> 47:29.000
A couple months later,
this jerk at school was picking on me,

47:29.080 --> 47:31.120
making fun of my hair
or my pants or whatever,

47:31.200 --> 47:33.200
and I was wishing that
he would just get lost.

47:34.520 --> 47:36.240
And then he was gone!

47:36.320 --> 47:38.720
Then they found him,
like, 10 feet up in an old oak tree

47:38.880 --> 47:40.440
hanging by a belt loop.

47:40.800 --> 47:42.400
But how is any of that possible?

47:42.480 --> 47:44.720
That's the point.
I don't know.

47:45.360 --> 47:46.600
Ever since that first incident,

47:46.720 --> 47:50.520
I have been driving myself crazy
trying to figure out what's wrong with me.

47:51.840 --> 47:53.760
I can't control my magic, Allyson.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.200
I don't know how or when
things are gonna happen,

47:56.280 --> 47:57.800
they just do.

47:58.680 --> 48:00.800
That must be so scary for you.

48:01.560 --> 48:03.160
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

48:05.280 --> 48:06.480
It's, um...

48:09.200 --> 48:10.800
It's terrifying.

48:12.400 --> 48:14.280
That's why I don't have any friends.

48:14.360 --> 48:16.320
And that's why I can't get up there
in front of those experts.

48:16.400 --> 48:19.160
Either nothing will happen
and I'll look like a total fraud,

48:19.240 --> 48:20.960
or my powers will get out of control

48:21.040 --> 48:23.720
and they'll recognize
this great gift of mine

48:24.360 --> 48:26.680
and I'll end up on some
government operating table

48:26.800 --> 48:29.600
being poked and probed
like an alien lab rat.

48:31.760 --> 48:32.800
Look...

48:33.400 --> 48:34.400
(SIGHS)

48:34.680 --> 48:37.120
I can't even come close to saying
I'm grasping all this,

48:38.200 --> 48:41.720
but I certainly do know
how it feels to be the outcast,

48:43.840 --> 48:45.200
the weirdo,

48:46.880 --> 48:48.720
the one nobody else can ever relate to.

48:51.680 --> 48:52.760
Not much fun, right?

48:54.840 --> 48:56.720
No, not so much.

48:57.680 --> 49:00.480
Well, see, that's why this is so perfect.

49:00.760 --> 49:03.480
Maybe what you need
more than anything is just...

49:04.600 --> 49:06.720
Just one person who's really
gonna believe in you.

49:07.640 --> 49:09.280
And that person's you?

49:09.640 --> 49:11.440
If you want me to be.

49:13.480 --> 49:14.560
Isn't that what friends are for?

49:14.840 --> 49:16.320
Yeah, I guess.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.240
You know what else?

49:18.480 --> 49:21.240
I think you should go
face Max's experts.

49:21.680 --> 49:24.480
Maybe they can help you.
Maybe they can explain all this.

49:27.680 --> 49:29.560
You've got nothing to lose, Danny.

49:30.040 --> 49:31.640
I mean, isn't this why
you were so desperate

49:31.720 --> 49:34.000
to get here in the first place?

49:34.720 --> 49:36.000
To find the truth?

49:38.240 --> 49:41.240
These guys might finally
give you the answers you need.

49:43.160 --> 49:44.560
ALLYSON:<i> Everything was set.</i>

49:44.640 --> 49:47.240
<i>Max's panel of experts</i>
<i>included two scientists</i>

49:47.320 --> 49:50.160

<i>And just so it wouldn't be</i>
<i>a stacked deck of techno-geeks,</i>

<i>Max also invited</i>
<i>a self-proclaimed psychic,</i>

<i>Madam Susette.</i>

50:05.920 --> 50:08.240
<i>And boy, does she look the part.</i>

50:10.560 --> 50:13.640
At what age did you
begin to notice this (CHUCKLES)

50:13.720 --> 50:15.200
ability?

50:15.280 --> 50:17.040
Around 13 or so.

50:17.120 --> 50:20.240
It's common for the powers to first appear
around the time of puberty.

50:20.360 --> 50:24.960
Tell me, Danny, is it possible
that these claims of paranormal powers

50:25.040 --> 50:28.560
are just a ploy to get
some extra attention around here?

50:28.640 --> 50:29.760
No, no. No.

50:29.840 --> 50:32.320
My colleague is merely
making a reasonable assumption.

50:32.400 --> 50:35.360
Anybody interested
in being in a reality TV show

50:35.440 --> 50:37.920
is obviously someone who craves
a lot of attention.

50:38.680 --> 50:42.360
Danny, do you have a family history
of paranormal abilities?

50:42.880 --> 50:45.200
-Your mother? Your father?
-No.

50:46.080 --> 50:47.160
An aunt, possibly?

50:47.240 --> 50:48.280
Not that I know of.

50:48.400 --> 50:52.200
Maybe a long-lost second cousin
twice removed on your father's side?

50:52.320 --> 50:54.640
Look, I'm sure we could
go on with this all day,

50:54.720 --> 50:59.480
but either this boy can demonstrate
his supposed powers or he cannot.

50:59.560 --> 51:01.520
I, for one, am ready to find out.

51:01.600 --> 51:02.680
What will you be attempting?

51:02.760 --> 51:05.840
Yes, Danny, tell us.
What's it going to be?

51:05.920 --> 51:08.280
A little localized snow storm, perhaps?

51:08.520 --> 51:11.360
Maybe a mechanical bull
appearing out of thin air?

51:11.960 --> 51:13.760
I honestly have no idea.

51:13.840 --> 51:16.080
Don't force it, Danny.
Just relax.

51:16.840 --> 51:19.600
Clear your mind of all thoughts.

51:20.640 --> 51:22.960
Let the powers come to you.

51:25.440 --> 51:28.680
Are you up to it, Danny?
Tell us. Are you up to it or not?

51:36.440 --> 51:37.480
(ALL GASP)

51:37.560 --> 51:38.760
Look!

51:38.960 --> 51:40.080
What?

51:40.440 --> 51:41.880
Do you see this?

51:43.520 --> 51:45.160
Remarkable!

51:46.320 --> 51:47.480
Okay, I'm... I'm losing it.

51:47.560 --> 51:49.720
Relax. Stay focused.
Breathe.

51:51.120 --> 51:52.600
Focus, focus.

51:58.360 --> 51:59.400
What are you doing?

51:59.480 --> 52:01.000
Get your hands off of him.

52:01.080 --> 52:04.320
Why? Are you afraid
I'm affecting his flight pattern?

52:04.400 --> 52:06.360
You weren't actually levitating,
were you, Danny?

52:06.480 --> 52:07.920
I thought I was.

52:08.000 --> 52:09.000
Of course he was!

52:09.160 --> 52:10.400
Oh, really?
Well, all right.

52:10.520 --> 52:11.800
I suppose it's possible.

52:11.880 --> 52:14.760
But instead of going
for far-fetched answers,

52:14.840 --> 52:18.560
why don't we look at a more logical
explanation right in front of us?

52:18.640 --> 52:19.760
Stand up, will you, Danny?

52:24.000 --> 52:26.840
You see, my friends,
the secret is not in the boy,

52:26.920 --> 52:28.000
it's in the chair.

52:28.520 --> 52:29.600
Please, explain.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.800
This is a very clever device

52:31.920 --> 52:35.880
invented by a Scandinavian illusionist
named Lars Holmstrom.

52:36.360 --> 52:37.440
He made two of them.

52:37.520 --> 52:41.200
One he kept for himself
and one I have here at the mansion.

52:41.280 --> 52:42.800
I keep it locked away in storage,

52:42.880 --> 52:45.920
although that could explain
why I received reports

52:46.000 --> 52:48.560
of you nosing around downstairs.

52:49.880 --> 52:51.680
I've never seen this chair before.

52:51.880 --> 52:55.080
Oh, I see. I guess it walked up here
all by itself, didn't it?

52:56.520 --> 52:59.160
I'd like to demonstrate for you,
ladies and gentlemen.

52:59.520 --> 53:02.080
There's a trigger device right here
behind the left leg.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.880
It's a hydraulic system.

53:04.640 --> 53:07.160
A thin plate recessed
into the chair seat...

53:07.240 --> 53:09.040
-What?
-...is attached to a rod

53:09.120 --> 53:11.920
which runs right up the middle spine
of the back of the chair.

53:12.120 --> 53:15.000
It is able to lift 200 pounds.

53:16.080 --> 53:20.920
It's a very ingenious device,
but a device nonetheless.

53:25.600 --> 53:29.120
Danny's a performer
like all performers.

53:29.720 --> 53:32.480
But a mighty clever one,
don't you think?

53:33.080 --> 53:34.080
Ah!

53:34.520 --> 53:36.600
Well, well. Interesting.

53:39.880 --> 53:41.320
Danny, wait.

53:41.640 --> 53:42.760
You can't run away from me.

53:42.840 --> 53:44.960
Listen, whatever you have to say,
I don't want to hear it, all right?

53:45.040 --> 53:46.800
Why?
Because you know you lied to me?

53:46.880 --> 53:48.520
I'm not a liar.

53:48.680 --> 53:50.680
"Nobody can relate to me.
My powers make me such a freak.

53:50.760 --> 53:52.440
"I'm so alone." Blah, blah, blah.

53:52.520 --> 53:54.040
Every single bit of that was true.

53:54.160 --> 53:57.320
Oh, really? Because it's feeling to me
like Professor French was right.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.880
You're only using me to make yourself
the star of the stupid show.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.960
Come on, Allyson, that is so not it!

54:02.040 --> 54:03.280
All right, don't you get it?

54:03.360 --> 54:05.520
Max is the one who doesn't
want my abilities revealed.

54:05.600 --> 54:06.800
He's the one who rigged the chair.

54:06.960 --> 54:08.240
-Care to tell me why?
-I don't know!

54:08.360 --> 54:10.760
Maybe there's some reason
why he's out to get me.

54:11.960 --> 54:13.360
You are...

54:13.560 --> 54:15.160
You are truly unbelievable.

54:15.640 --> 54:16.680
You never quit, do you?

54:17.560 --> 54:20.000
You actually had me fooled
for a minute there.

54:20.080 --> 54:21.840
Except suddenly,
it couldn't be clearer.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.960
You're exactly like everybody else
I've ever known.

54:24.120 --> 54:25.880
Setting me up to make me
look like a fool,

54:25.960 --> 54:27.760
just so you can prove
I'm not as smart as I think I am!

54:27.840 --> 54:29.480
Will you get over yourself?

54:29.720 --> 54:30.840
All right, did you ever stop to think

54:30.920 --> 54:32.480
that maybe this has
nothing to do with you?

54:34.120 --> 54:36.760
You know what?
Tell it to someone who cares.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.560
Sorry I was ever lame enough
to imagine we were friends.

54:47.440 --> 54:49.800
So, where did that leave us?

54:50.200 --> 54:52.800
As far as the expert panel
was concerned,

54:52.880 --> 54:55.040
Danny was just
an ordinary kid magician

54:55.120 --> 54:58.640
who also happened to be
a truly impressive trickster.

55:00.040 --> 55:02.800
Well, much to Hunter's dismay,

55:03.160 --> 55:05.600
that meant Danny was
not only still eligible

55:05.680 --> 55:07.760
to compete in the grand finale,

55:07.880 --> 55:11.240
but it also meant that he was
probably a shoo-in to win.

55:12.200 --> 55:15.160
And as for me, well,

55:15.320 --> 55:19.240
losing a friend did not mean
I was willing to lose my job.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.840
The big difference was that,
from here on out,

55:21.920 --> 55:24.840
Danny and I were gonna be
all about the show

55:25.160 --> 55:26.440
and nothing else.

55:38.280 --> 55:40.520
Hey, shouldn't we be out
getting new footage

55:40.600 --> 55:42.840
of Danny practicing
his new trick or something?

55:43.600 --> 55:45.480
I'd love to, Cedric, but I'm busy.

55:47.280 --> 55:48.440
Oh, still ticked, huh?

55:49.200 --> 55:50.200
Don't I have a right to be?

55:50.560 --> 55:53.520
I don't know if Danny lied to you
about the levitation chair or what,

55:53.600 --> 55:55.040
but he's still a great magician.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.640
I mean, if nothing else.

55:56.720 --> 56:00.720
And we both know he totally pulled off
getting those doves into Paul's van.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.440
No, he didn't.

56:02.520 --> 56:04.400
I'm sure it's just one more lousy trick.

56:05.120 --> 56:06.440
I'll bet you I can show you
how he did it.

56:06.520 --> 56:07.600
Sure.

56:09.840 --> 56:14.560
Okay, somewhere in here we're gonna
see his parents or somebody show up

56:14.640 --> 56:16.120
to start loading those doves into the van.

56:16.200 --> 56:17.840
How? Paul locked it when we left.

56:17.920 --> 56:19.640
It was still locked when we got back.

56:20.720 --> 56:23.880
Maybe we left a window
cracked or something. I don't know.

56:25.120 --> 56:28.240
Hate to tell you, but here we come,
and nobody's messed with the van.

56:31.640 --> 56:32.800
You're opening the door.

56:32.880 --> 56:34.920
I still haven't seen any dove wrangler.

56:37.080 --> 56:38.320
Did you see that?

56:38.480 --> 56:40.240
Back it up! Back it up!

56:45.640 --> 56:47.880
ALLYSON: Those doves came out of nothing.

56:48.600 --> 56:50.840
CEDRIC: Now you see it, now you don't.

56:51.680 --> 56:53.120
It's a miracle.

56:54.840 --> 56:55.840
Absolutely.

56:56.040 --> 56:57.080
(CHUCKLES)

56:57.280 --> 56:58.280
Without a doubt.

57:04.240 --> 57:05.880
ALLYSON: Danny's not a magician.

57:06.920 --> 57:08.240
He's a wizard.

57:22.520 --> 57:23.680
Danny?

57:24.400 --> 57:25.520
(KNOCKS)

57:25.840 --> 57:27.040
Danny?

57:29.320 --> 57:30.480
Danny?

57:35.760 --> 57:37.000
Come on.

57:40.640 --> 57:43.440
Cedric, you check outside.
I'll check the vault.

57:54.800 --> 57:56.160
Danny?

58:08.320 --> 58:10.120
(MUFFLED CHATTER)

58:11.960 --> 58:14.040
MAX: Come on, Danny.
Sit down, relax.

58:14.120 --> 58:16.240
It's nothing to concern yourself with.

58:16.440 --> 58:17.600
DANNY: You're sure?

58:21.080 --> 58:22.760
MAX: You came here looking
for answers, didn't you?

58:22.840 --> 58:25.000
Isn't that why you entered the contest?

58:25.080 --> 58:26.840
Well, yeah. I guess.

58:29.280 --> 58:31.400
MAX: I have exactly what it is
you're looking for.

58:31.480 --> 58:32.720
Sit down.

58:37.360 --> 58:39.440
Danny, I know all about you.

58:39.720 --> 58:42.360
I know about your struggles,
I know about your confusion,

58:42.440 --> 58:44.720
and I know about your powers.

58:45.080 --> 58:48.440
But aren't you the one
who said I was faking it to get attention?

58:48.520 --> 58:52.440
I mean, aren't you the president
of the Worldwide Skeptics Society?

58:52.800 --> 58:54.160
It's a perfect cover, isn't it?

58:55.120 --> 58:56.480
You see, every generation,

58:56.560 --> 59:00.560
one or two truly powerful
sorcerers are born, with magical abilities

59:00.640 --> 59:03.760
that would boggle
the imagination of ordinary men.

59:04.080 --> 59:06.280
I'm one of those true wizards.

59:06.680 --> 59:08.040
And, Danny,

59:10.080 --> 59:11.080
so are you.

59:13.760 --> 59:15.520
But how did you know?

59:15.600 --> 59:17.520
I mean, how did you find me?

59:17.600 --> 59:19.440
I didn't find you.
You found me.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.040
I created this show,
hoping it would act as a lure

59:23.160 --> 59:25.400
to bring out one more great sorcerer,

59:25.560 --> 59:26.640
and it worked.

59:27.040 --> 59:29.200
But if I'm so great and magical,

59:29.280 --> 59:31.960
then how come my powers
are always totally out of my control?

59:32.040 --> 59:35.400
Well, you're young yet,
you're untrained,

59:35.480 --> 59:36.880
but all that's about to change.

59:39.240 --> 59:42.200
-What do you mean?
-Harnessing your power

59:42.280 --> 59:45.560
is about focus and concentration.

59:45.640 --> 59:47.040
It's about learning to believe

59:47.120 --> 59:49.520
that you are entitled
to this great gift you've been given.

59:49.600 --> 59:51.520
-Oh, my gosh.
-It's nothing to be ashamed of.

59:51.600 --> 59:53.040
It's nothing to be afraid of.

59:53.160 --> 59:56.600
Danny, I have felt every single thing
that you've been feeling.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.640
I was exactly like you,

59:59.320 --> 1:00:01.120
alone and afraid.

1:00:01.640 --> 1:00:05.360
And then one day,
I met my mentor,

1:00:06.360 --> 1:00:07.520
Antonio DeMilo,

1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:11.440
and I began to feel what I know
you're going to begin to feel.

1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:14.200
I felt safe. I felt home.

1:00:14.920 --> 1:00:17.840
And that's where you are, Danny.
You're home.

1:00:17.920 --> 1:00:19.320
Watch this.

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:27.640
Now, you try.

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:40.800
You need to be more centered.

1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:42.840
It's all about concentration.

1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:44.800
It's all about focus.

1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:48.360
What you need to do is,
you need to believe.

1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:01.920
There. You see how simple that is?

1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:04.680
All right now,

1:01:05.800 --> 1:01:08.480
let's see what you've got.

1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:22.520
Come on! Hit him!

1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:24.360
Come on, come on! Yeah!

1:01:26.560 --> 1:01:27.600
Get back!

1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:29.640
Oh!

1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:32.000
Get him!
Come on! Yeah!

1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:34.000
Come on!

1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:39.400
Yeah! I'm gonna get you, Max!

1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:44.000
Max, I'm so sorry.
That thing could've killed you.

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:47.160
It's fine, Danny.
It's perfectly fine. We'll work on it.

1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:49.960
We'll work on it together.
That's what mentors are for.

1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:52.400
Meanwhile, I have a gift for you.

1:01:58.400 --> 1:01:59.600
Here.

1:02:00.360 --> 1:02:02.000
Slip this ring on your finger

1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:04.440
and while your tutelage proceeds,

1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:07.560
your powers will remain totally in check.

1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:09.440
There'll be no more unexpected spells,

1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:11.200
no more vanishing friends,

1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:13.440
no more having to worry
about your every thought.

1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:15.800
Well, how... I mean, how is that possible?

1:02:15.920 --> 1:02:17.080
Magic.

1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:20.200
Here. Go ahead.

1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:26.080
Feels good, doesn't it?

1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:29.120
Yeah, you...
You don't even know.

1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:31.880
But are you sure it's gonna work?

1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:34.080
Yes, I'm sure.

1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:36.560
Look, I know this is overwhelming for you.

1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:39.160
It's an awful lot to digest,
an awful lot to grasp,

1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:43.320
so I think you should go back to your room
and have a good night's sleep.

1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:46.720
I want you to have the best sleep
you've ever had in your life tonight.

1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:48.600
Thank you, Max.

1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:51.280
Good night.

1:02:56.160 --> 1:02:57.160
ALLYSON: Paul.

1:02:58.880 --> 1:03:01.200
Sounded to me like that went pretty well.

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:04.600
He clearly has the potential
to be more powerful than I'll ever be.

1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:08.840
That's why it's imperative
we keep a close eye on him.

1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:10.840
Not that it's a problem.

1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:15.000
As long as no one removes
that ring from his finger, he's no threat,

1:03:15.160 --> 1:03:17.240
because as you know,
he can't remove it himself.

1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:20.560
And by this time tomorrow,

1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:22.920
his powers will be mine,

1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:26.400
just like DeMilo before him.

1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:44.120
Danny, please wake up.
Are you in there?

1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:45.360
We need to talk. Please.

1:03:45.440 --> 1:03:47.080
-Open up, please.
-PAUL: Allyson.

1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:52.680
It's late. Shouldn't you be in bed?

1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:55.120
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:06.240
After a completely horrible
sleepless night,

1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:10.360
I realized it didn't matter
how mad I'd been at Danny.

1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:14.200
Max was up to something,
something terrible,

1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.720
and if I didn't warn Danny, who would?

1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:25.040
-We need to talk.
-Nice catch!

1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:26.840
Will you listen to me?
This is serious!

1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:29.680
Max is not who you think he is.

1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:31.880
Yeah, I know.
It turns out that he's the only one

1:04:31.960 --> 1:04:33.120
that truly understands me.

1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:35.120
No, Danny, you're wrong!

1:04:39.800 --> 1:04:40.960
Look,

1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:43.000
it would be better
if we could talk alone, okay?

1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:44.840
Why? These guys are my friends.

1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:47.400
I'm actually making real friends, Allyson.

1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:49.520
For the first time in forever
I'm feeling like...

1:04:51.360 --> 1:04:52.600
Like a normal kid!

1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:54.400
Yeah?

1:04:54.480 --> 1:04:55.480
Well, I hate to break it to you,

1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:57.840
but maybe that isn't
who you were born to be.

1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:00.480
CEDRIC: Hey! What the...

1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:03.240
Wait. You followed me?

1:05:03.320 --> 1:05:04.600
No!

1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:06.320
I... I was looking for you,

1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:08.440
and I heard voices
through the grate in the wall. I...

1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:10.560
I went to investigate,
saw you there with Max...

1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:12.120
All right, great!
Then you heard.

1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:14.120
All right. This ring's on me
to keep my powers in check

1:05:14.200 --> 1:05:15.440
until I'm able to handle them.

1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:16.640
But that's just it!

1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:19.920
After you left the chamber,
I was still there when Paul came back,

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.080
and Max told him...

1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:24.960
He said your magic's too powerful,

1:05:25.040 --> 1:05:26.720
that you need to be watched.

1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:29.560
And he also said that...

1:05:30.320 --> 1:05:32.800
That as long as that ring
stays on your finger,

1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:35.760
your powers are totally in his control.

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:38.520
Oh, come on, Allyson!

1:05:38.600 --> 1:05:40.160
All right, that doesn't
even make any sense!

1:05:40.240 --> 1:05:41.720
But it's true!

1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:45.400
You know what?
I have proof.

1:05:53.400 --> 1:05:54.640
Come on!

1:05:57.440 --> 1:05:58.480
Okay...

1:05:58.600 --> 1:06:01.080
Allyson! Good.
I'm glad you're here. Hello, Danny.

1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:03.240
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for tonight's finale?

1:06:04.040 --> 1:06:05.040
Sure.

1:06:05.160 --> 1:06:06.720
Ms. McAllister?

1:06:08.320 --> 1:06:11.520
Danny and Max are both real sorcerers,
and Max is out to suppress Danny's powers.

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:12.880
-Allyson.
-I'm not kidding!

1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:14.240
I have it all here on this tape!

1:06:14.320 --> 1:06:15.640
She has no idea
what she's talking about.

1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:17.640
Yes, I do!
It's all right here!

1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:19.400
Then perhaps what we ought to do

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:21.600
is watch this tape of yours, huh?

1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:26.640
MS. McALLISTER: What is this about, Max?

1:06:26.760 --> 1:06:28.480
I can assure you, I have no idea.

1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:41.000
Go ahead. Show them.

1:06:41.760 --> 1:06:44.640
Show them what you're
really all about, huh?

1:06:51.480 --> 1:06:53.000
Now you'll see.

1:06:55.120 --> 1:06:56.960
<i>He clearly has the...</i>

1:07:04.480 --> 1:07:07.520
Well, now, what do we call this, Allyson?

1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:09.720
Polar bear in a snowstorm?

1:07:09.920 --> 1:07:11.760
This... This can't be.

1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:14.640
It was here! I know it was!

1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:18.400
I shot it myself.
You guys...

1:07:19.480 --> 1:07:22.040
Please, you have to believe me.

1:07:22.920 --> 1:07:25.520
Don't you get it?
He messed with it. He did something!

1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:27.440
Please, you have to believe me.

1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:29.560
They're sorcerers, both of them!

1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:32.160
Only Danny's basically good
and Max might be evil!

1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:33.840
Oh, yes, yes,

1:07:33.920 --> 1:07:38.040
and the big bad wolf
is coming to blow our house down?

1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:39.840
Please, you have to believe me.

1:07:39.920 --> 1:07:41.000
I know what I saw and heard.

1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:44.600
The problem is, you're confusing
fact with fantasy, Allyson,

1:07:44.680 --> 1:07:46.440
and I don't think that's
a very good quality

1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:48.400
for a reality producer,
don't you agree?

1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:51.840
You're probably just overwrought
and overworked.

1:07:51.920 --> 1:07:54.480
We've been asking
an awful lot of you teen producers.

1:07:54.560 --> 1:07:57.160
The pressure was bound
to get to one of you.

1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:59.120
Danny, please, tell her.

1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:02.640
-Danny, please.
-Tell them what, Allyson?

1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:04.080
I'm just a normal kid magician

1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:06.920
who happens to be
a truly impressive trickster, that's all.

1:08:07.080 --> 1:08:10.000
Allyson, I'm so sorry that you're upset,

1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:13.400
and I'm sorry that you're misinformed,

1:08:13.480 --> 1:08:16.760
but I do think that
the very best thing for our show,

1:08:16.840 --> 1:08:19.280
and for your own
personal health and well-being,

1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:23.040
is that we send you home at once, hmm?

1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:26.760
Well, it's just to get a little rest.

1:08:26.840 --> 1:08:28.280
No, you can't do this to me!

1:08:30.880 --> 1:08:32.000
Ms. McAllister, please, I...

1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:33.640
Allyson, Max is right.

1:08:33.720 --> 1:08:36.880
It's painfully clear
that you need to go, okay?

1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:38.280
I'm sorry.

1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:40.480
Wait, she...

1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:00.680
Allyson.

1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:03.840
-Allyson, listen...
-Save it, okay?

1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:05.760
You had your chance
to speak up, and you didn't.

1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:07.360
Speak up about what?

1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:09.280
All right, you said
you had proof, but you didn't.

1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:12.560
You claim that Max is out to get me,
but you don't know how or why.

1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:14.360
I mean, how was I
supposed to believe you, huh?

1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:18.280
Besides, you have no idea

1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:21.000
how happy I've been lately,
feeling like...

1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:25.360
Like a normal kid
for the first time in years.

1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:27.880
I mean,

1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:29.880
it's the only thing I've ever wanted.

1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:31.520
That's interesting,

1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:32.680
'cause if you want my opinion,

1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:34.680
I think what you really
came here searching for

1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:37.800
was to find somebody
who could accept you as you are

1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:39.680
and be your friend.

1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:44.840
Allyson, look...

1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:48.720
(TRAM BELL DINGS)

1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:50.080
Allyson!

1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:51.440
Allyson!

1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:52.760
Allyson!

1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:56.600
Wow, look at this, your last great trick.

1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:00.200
Managing to make
your only ally disappear, huh?

1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:24.600
ALLYSON: <i>I so stupidly thought</i>
<i>Danny and I were friends.</i>

1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:28.080
<i>But there was one little thing</i>
<i>that wouldn't quit nagging at me.</i>

1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:30.680
<i>If Antonio DeMilo had founded</i>
<i>the Magic Mansion</i>

1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:32.800
<i>and served as Max's mentor,</i>

1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:34.880
<i>what had happened to him?</i>

1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:39.400
<i>There was something in my gut</i>
<i>telling me this was one last puzzle</i>

1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:41.960
<i>crying out to be solved.</i>

1:10:56.760 --> 1:10:59.200
<i>DeMilo's power seemed</i>
<i>to have deserted him.</i>

1:10:59.280 --> 1:11:01.840
<i>A prop that he had worked with</i>
<i>a thousand times</i>

1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:05.040
<i>fell on him during a live performance</i>
<i>and crushed his skull.</i>

1:11:06.840 --> 1:11:08.080
<i>And then I saw it,</i>

1:11:08.200 --> 1:11:10.320
<i>the ring that DeMilo was wearing,</i>

1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:12.480
<i>the ring that drains</i>
<i>a magician's power,</i>

1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:15.560
<i>the ring that my friend</i>
<i>Danny was now wearing,</i>

1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:17.640
<i>and I knew what was</i>
<i>going to happen.</i>

1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:22.320
<i>His powers would fail him, too,</i>
<i>if I didn't get that ring off his finger.</i>

1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:31.320
I had to tell him everything I suspected,
everything I found.

1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:34.000
I wasn't sure exactly
what he was up to,

1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:36.760
but if Max was now
planning to rob Danny of his powers

1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:39.000
or perhaps
something even worse,

1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:42.760
he'd have the perfect opportunity
during the finale that night,

1:11:42.840 --> 1:11:44.920
the finale that was
just about to start.

1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:47.480
I was out of time.

1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:50.520
I had to get back
into the Magic Mansion to warn my friend.

1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:53.520
Sure. Okay.

1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:55.800
But how?

1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:14.480
-MS. McALLISTER: Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair.
-Hey.

1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:16.120
-Welcome. How are you?
-Hi.

1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:17.640
-It's very nice to see you.
-Nice seeing you.

1:12:17.720 --> 1:12:19.680
-This is a big day for Danny.
-He's excited.

1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:21.200
We have a table
right up front for you.

1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:22.880
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:26.080
HUNTER: Hey, you!
Put that trunk over here!

1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:29.360
Hey, I need that camera
out here now, okay? Just now!

1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:32.400
You! You!
I need you covering arrivals in the lobby.

1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:33.640
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yes.
-Signature.

1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:35.600
Don't worry. I'm on it.

1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:38.480
I got a delivery for Danny Sinclair!

1:12:40.200 --> 1:12:42.080
Let's move, people!
We're live in 10 minutes!

1:12:42.160 --> 1:12:43.640
A little more hustle
would be appreciated!

1:12:43.720 --> 1:12:45.120
Let's go!

1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:46.960
Hi! Looking good, huh?

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.160
My headset, please.

1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:51.320
I just figured
with Allyson booted off the show,

1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:53.680
you probably needed somebody
to pick up the slack.

1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:55.760
All I need from you is to find Max

1:12:55.840 --> 1:12:57.440
and make sure Brandon
is ready to go on.

1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:00.520
I hear he's freaking out
over some sequin crisis or something.

1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:01.920
-No problem!
-Okay.

1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:04.440
I'm going on in, like, five minutes
and nothing's ready!

1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:06.880
Wardrobe malfunction, all the way!

1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:08.840
I don't get it, Max.
How am I gonna do my final trick

1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:10.480
if this ring keeps my powers in check?

1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:13.200
Don't worry about it.
We're in this together now, Danny.

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:14.520
I'll be right there with you.

1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:17.600
Just go out on that stage,
and I'll make sure the magic happens.

1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:18.960
Isn't that kind of like cheating?

1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:22.160
I mean, maybe I should just take it off
until the contest is over.

1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:23.320
No.

1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:26.880
Do you remember how you felt
before you put that ring on?

1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:28.600
Do you wanna feel that way again?

1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:30.400
Danny, I want you to trust me.

1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:31.600
All you have to do

1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:35.240
is go out on that stage tonight,
relax, and have fun.

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:36.800
Ms. McAllister needs you on stage, Max.

1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:39.320
Yes. I'll be there shortly. Look,

1:13:39.640 --> 1:13:41.560
we can do great things
together, Danny.

1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:43.520
Don't let me down.
I'm counting on you.

1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:48.160
BRANDON: This jacket's not even
buttoned up right, to the light!

1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:50.440
Nothing's ready,
and I'm going on in, like, five minutes!

1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:52.680
Nothing's ready! Wardrobe malfunction!

1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:26.760
Tonight, our search will come to an end.

1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:31.320
Three incredible contestants,
one final challenge.

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:35.320
Who will be the world's
greatest kid magician?

1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:37.360
Currently in first place,

1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:40.760
please help me welcome
the brilliant Brandon Ross!

1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:05.480
-Keep your eye on him.
-Okay.

1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:35.800
Hey. What are you doing back here?

1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:37.240
I thought Max banned you
from this place.

1:15:37.320 --> 1:15:38.760
He did.

1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:41.080
But I just couldn't stay away, you know?

1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:44.360
-Me and magic, we're like this.
-Yeah?

1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:46.640
Well, too bad, 'cause I think
security's gonna wanna talk to you.

1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:48.280
Oh, come on, Hunter.
Don't be a jerk.

1:15:48.400 --> 1:15:49.840
I mean, if you're gonna rat me out,

1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:52.080
at least let me show you
a new little trick I learned first.

1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:53.480
Well, what kind of trick?

1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:54.840
Oh, it's simple, really.

1:15:54.920 --> 1:15:57.520
All I do is make
my problem disappear!

1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:00.920
Allyson, get back here! Allyson!

1:16:05.160 --> 1:16:07.440
(CLOWN VOICES LAUGHING)

1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:14.040
(APPLAUSE)

1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:23.640
And now, please help me in welcoming
our second contestant,

1:16:23.720 --> 1:16:26.560
Philadelphia's own Zoe Cunningham!

1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:33.520
Camera one, get ready.

1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:35.000
This should be fun. She's real cute.

1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:41.680
Allyson's here. She's here.
Over there. Okay?

1:16:49.800 --> 1:16:52.000
Hey, man, have some fun
out there, all right?

1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:53.720
Thank you. Thanks.

1:16:58.520 --> 1:16:59.600
Psst!

1:16:59.680 --> 1:17:01.000
Danny!

1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:05.920
Allyson, what are you doing here?

1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:07.440
I've got something I need to show you.

1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:09.440
It's about Max's mentor,
Antonio DeMilo.

1:17:11.160 --> 1:17:12.280
-So?
-So,

1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:14.920
he died in an onstage accident
during a live performance

1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:18.120
and happened to be wearing
the exact same ring Max gave to you,

1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:20.400
and you're seriously telling me
that doesn't mean anything?

1:17:20.480 --> 1:17:21.680
-Yeah!
-Danny,

1:17:21.760 --> 1:17:23.560
you didn't hear Max
down in his chamber with Paul.

1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:26.080
I did, and you're in real danger here!

1:17:26.280 --> 1:17:27.560
Allyson, that's ridiculous.

1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:30.480
Max is controlling your powers
with that ring,

1:17:30.840 --> 1:17:32.880
and I heard him say
you can't take it off by yourself.

1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:34.520
If you still don't believe me,
then just take it off

1:17:34.600 --> 1:17:35.600
and see how different you feel!

1:17:35.680 --> 1:17:36.880
I don't want to take it off!

1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:38.400
All right? I know how different I'll feel.

1:17:38.480 --> 1:17:42.840
I'll feel scared and isolated
and petrified of my own thoughts.

1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:44.560
All right? I've been there!

1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:46.200
And I'm not interested in going back.

1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:48.400
But you can learn to master all that.

1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:49.760
MS. McALLISTER: Danny!

1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:52.320
You're on in one minute.

1:17:52.400 --> 1:17:54.920
I'll be right there, Ms. McAllister.

1:17:57.680 --> 1:17:59.640
Please, listen to me.

1:17:59.720 --> 1:18:01.520
I really don't wanna see you get hurt.

1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:04.360
Look, I might not have
concrete proof about Max,

1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:05.960
but I know I'm right!

1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:08.680
He doesn't honestly care
about you, and I do!

1:18:10.200 --> 1:18:11.400
Please, Danny,

1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:13.640
I'm begging you to take a leap of faith.

1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:17.760
I gotta go, all right?

1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:20.480
Wait! At least you could
let me take your ring off.

1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:22.320
You might be able
to fight back if you need to.

1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:24.920
I'm sorry, Allyson.

1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:26.400
All right?

1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:27.920
I won't do it.

1:18:40.920 --> 1:18:42.960
And now, drum roll, please.

1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:47.200
Help me give a warm welcome
to our final contestant,

1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:49.280
the one and only Danny Sinclair!

1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:51.840
Go, Danny!

1:18:52.360 --> 1:18:53.520
Yeah!

1:18:53.640 --> 1:18:55.400
Come on, Danny!

1:18:56.200 --> 1:18:57.680
Well, Danny, here it is.

1:18:58.360 --> 1:19:01.520
One last feat of legerdemain.

1:19:02.560 --> 1:19:03.680
How are you feeling?

1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:06.720
To be perfectly honest,
way too ready to get this over with.

1:19:06.800 --> 1:19:09.120
Oh, now, wait a minute, my friend,

1:19:09.880 --> 1:19:13.800
you mean to tell me
that a young, skinny fellow like you

1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:16.480
is claiming that he's able
to lift that weight

1:19:16.560 --> 1:19:18.080
all on his own?

1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:21.160
That's 1,000 pounds of pure lead.

1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:25.800
You mean to say
that you dare to try to lift that

1:19:25.880 --> 1:19:27.440
and raise it over your head?

1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:29.720
That's the plan, yeah.

1:19:29.800 --> 1:19:31.880
What do you think, folks?
Is it possible?

1:19:32.280 --> 1:19:33.560
(AUDIENCE MIXED REACTIONS)

1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:36.720
-Are you ready, Danny?
-Absolutely.

1:19:36.800 --> 1:19:38.120
Well, let's get on with the show.

1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:40.480
That's what we came for,
ladies and gentlemen.

1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:00.560
(BOOING)

1:20:01.280 --> 1:20:03.720
Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

1:20:07.400 --> 1:20:08.640
Give it up!

1:20:15.880 --> 1:20:17.320
-Give it up!
-Just settle down, okay?

1:20:20.240 --> 1:20:21.760
Go home!

1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:40.200
Come on, Danny!

1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:55.400
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:02.000
Yeah!

1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:20.600
See that?

1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:31.640
Danny, look out!

1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:34.280
Look out!

1:21:45.840 --> 1:21:47.480
I can't get the ring off!

1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:48.640
It's stuck!

1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:50.400
Please come over here!
I'll take it off for you!

1:21:50.920 --> 1:21:51.920
Come on. Please!

1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:53.120
Come on!

1:21:56.360 --> 1:21:57.720
Well, well, well!

1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:05.040
It looks like we're going to need
a much stronger stage, eh?

1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:06.440
(LAUGHTER)

1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:09.640
I can't imagine what it is
Danny intends to do next,

1:22:09.720 --> 1:22:12.280
but I hope he's not planning
on using that weight again.

1:22:12.360 --> 1:22:13.600
What do you say, folks?

1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:16.520
Why don't we give
this young man another chance, eh?

1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:19.720
(ALL CHEERING)

1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:24.120
Is there a problem, Danny?

1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:27.200
Listen, I know about
DeMilo and the ring, Max. You tricked me!

1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:29.000
Yes. It's a pretty clever trick,
don't you think?

1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:30.200
Yeah, well, it's not gonna work, Max.

1:22:30.280 --> 1:22:31.920
-Well, we'll see.
-Yeah, we'll see.

1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:35.360
Ladies and gentlemen,
this young man is ready to work again.

1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:37.800
Why don't we give him
a nice round of applause

1:22:37.880 --> 1:22:40.080
so he can finish his act, eh?

1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:50.880
It's your move, Danny.

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.960
Special delivery for Danny Sinclair?

1:22:57.320 --> 1:22:59.320
Well, what could this be?

1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:03.160
A new wrinkle has been added, eh?

1:23:04.520 --> 1:23:05.520
What is it?

1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:15.240
(LAUGHTER)

1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:19.400
Well, every great magician

1:23:19.480 --> 1:23:23.040
deserves a beautiful assistant,
don't you...

1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:24.400
Don't you think, Max?

1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:26.160
Oh, I don't know.

1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:27.560
It seems to me

1:23:28.560 --> 1:23:32.000
that whenever a new element
has been added belatedly,

1:23:32.080 --> 1:23:34.280
it can be quite a sticking point.

1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:42.760
And it has been my experience

1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:46.400
that not every assistant
is quite as

1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:48.760
sharp as she might be.

1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:50.800
-(ALLYSON SCREAMS)
-Allyson!

1:23:58.560 --> 1:23:59.840
Well,

1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:02.160
they do say

1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:04.760
that good help is hard
to find these days.

1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:07.640
Well, as amusing as all of this has been,
ladies and gentlemen,

1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:08.960
particularly for me,

1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:12.920
why don't we give Danny a chance
to focus on his trick?

1:24:14.320 --> 1:24:16.480
-Right, right.
-Ladies and gentlemen...

1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:17.680
(KNOCKING)

1:24:18.680 --> 1:24:20.080
(WHISPERED CHATTER)

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:23.400
Allyson!

1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:24.960
(LOUD CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:29.560
Ah-ha!

1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:32.320
Better late than never.
That's my motto.

1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:36.280
Allyson, what are you doing here?

1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:38.160
I told you.
You can't remove the ring yourself.

1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:40.400
-Someone else has to.
-You don't give up, do you?

1:24:40.480 --> 1:24:41.680
Not when it's something I care about.

1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:43.400
Well, be my guest.

1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:56.640
What do you think you're doing?

1:24:57.200 --> 1:24:58.400
Oh, my final trick, Max.

1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:00.720
Isn't that what you've been
urging me to do?

1:25:01.880 --> 1:25:06.360
Ladies and gentlemen,
Max has so graciously agreed to join me

1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:08.560
as I perform my final act.

1:25:10.760 --> 1:25:13.240
You're no match for me, Danny.

1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:17.600
With or without the ring,
your powers will soon be mine.

1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:19.280
-No. Never.
-As you wish.

1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:21.240
Your move, Max.

1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:25.400
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's get on with this show.

1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:29.320
Whoa!

1:25:48.760 --> 1:25:50.360
Whoa!

1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:00.720
Danny, the ring!

1:26:02.120 --> 1:26:03.880
It's the last piece of the puzzle!

1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:05.440
You've gotta use it against Max!

1:26:07.680 --> 1:26:08.920
Now it's my move, Max!

1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:10.480
(SCREAMING)

1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:20.400
(AUDIENCE GASPING)

1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:22.920
What is this? What?

1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:33.760
(LOUD CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:38.680
That was awesome!

1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:42.240
Yeah, Danny!

1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:54.800
So, that was it,

1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:58.200
the most incredible experience
anyone could've ever imagined,

1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:00.240
and I was there to witness it all.

1:27:00.920 --> 1:27:03.680
Of course, Max must've gotten Paul
to take the ring off for him,

1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:06.280
because by the time
we returned to the production office,

1:27:06.360 --> 1:27:10.440
every single show tape
had mysteriously disappeared.

1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:12.520
But then,

1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:16.440
someone managed to make them mysteriously
reappear right here in my room.

1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:19.000
I cut together everything you just saw

1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:21.200
because I felt like
it was really important

1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:22.720
for everyone to know the truth.

1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:24.960
And Danny?

1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:28.280
Well, once he realized
that Max was still out there somewhere,

1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:29.600
he went into hiding,

1:27:29.680 --> 1:27:32.480
hoping to hone his skills
and get real control of his powers

1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:34.640
before they meet again.

1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:38.160
I hear he's definitely
getting stronger every single day.

1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:40.760
Unfortunately,

1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:43.200
even I'm not allowed
to know where he's hiding.

1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:48.080
Okay, so maybe
I do know where he is.

1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:49.720
(SCREAMING)

1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:52.960
How'd I get here?

1:27:53.080 --> 1:27:54.640
Magic.

1:27:54.800 --> 1:27:56.160
You know, I still don't know
how you do that!

1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:59.640
Oh, a good magician never reveals
the secrets of his tricks.

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:02.560
ALLYSON: Show-off!
