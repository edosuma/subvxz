00:02.170 --> 00:03.671
Lady Luck
is on your side
from LA to Vegas.

00:03.704 --> 00:06.907
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?
Don't cockpit-block me.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.342
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.046
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:12.080 --> 00:13.247
and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

00:13.281 --> 00:14.582
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.621
Cheers!

00:22.923 --> 00:24.758
ARTEM:
Hey, Ronnie.

00:24.792 --> 00:25.859
Ronnie!

00:25.893 --> 00:27.728
Oh, hey, what is it, Artem?

00:27.761 --> 00:30.064
I'm not very happy right now.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.666
If I were an emoji,
I would be frown face.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.735
Oh, if this is about your
cologne, I already told you,

00:34.768 --> 00:36.170
you can't bring
that stuff on board,

00:36.204 --> 00:37.571
they use it in explosives.

00:37.605 --> 00:40.040
No, that's a separate
infuriating issue.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.409
This is about luggage.

00:41.442 --> 00:45.379
Now Jackpot charge ten dollars
for carry-on.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.781
This fee is no good
for gambling profit.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.283
I know, it sucks.

00:49.317 --> 00:51.385
It's just Jackpot following
the other airlines' lead.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.387
They're squeezing out
every dollar they can.

00:53.421 --> 00:56.056
It's better than when they tried
charging for overhead bassinets.

01:00.761 --> 01:04.765
-I still have nightmares about
the babies I didn't catch. -Oh.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.567
Well, I'm outraged.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.903
-I'm gonna give this flight
zero stars on Airbnb. -Okay.

01:09.937 --> 01:13.974
Wait, um, how about I let you
use the beverage cart,

01:14.007 --> 01:16.210
so you can make that weird
tomato juice iced tea thing

01:16.244 --> 01:17.478
you're always talking about?

01:17.511 --> 01:20.148
I can finally make
an Artem Palmer?

01:20.181 --> 01:21.249
You have deal, Ronnie.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.750
Oh. If I were emoji now,

01:22.783 --> 01:26.387
I would be smiley face
or lady in the bathtub.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.157
Because I pamper myself.

01:29.190 --> 01:32.426
Have to admit, pretty impressive
how you handled that.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.762
I was expecting cologne
to start exploding any minute.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.331
I know how to manage
my passengers.

01:37.365 --> 01:40.334
It's my job to know what
they need. They're my people.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.769
Like, uh, like that guy.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.104
That's James. He always
shows up for his flight

01:44.138 --> 01:46.274
so drunk, he forgets
the name of his hotel.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.676
So, I write it down for him.
Hey, James.

01:48.709 --> 01:49.977
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.513
Ooh, the Wynn.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.082
Sober me must be
doing pretty good.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.651
And that's Ben.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.119
He says he's here
visiting family,

01:59.153 --> 02:00.854
but I'm pretty sure
he's just stalking Nichole.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.524
-Oh, he's harmless.

02:03.557 --> 02:07.661
It's her other stalker, Kristen,
we really have to worry about.

02:07.695 --> 02:08.929
And that's Dean.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.798
He's always one
of the first to board,

02:10.831 --> 02:12.366
orders his coffee black,

02:12.400 --> 02:14.101
two sugars, and every week,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.003
flies with his lovely,
lovely wife...

02:17.838 --> 02:21.175
...who is suddenly blonde
and 20 years younger.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.180
PILOT :
Jackpot Airlines.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.115
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.118
*

02:35.088 --> 02:37.057
-WOMAN: I got it, I got it.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.196
Oh.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.631
You have to pay to open it now.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.066
Oh, I see.
So they're holding my biography

02:46.099 --> 02:47.901
of Patty Hearst
hostage up there.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.370
Well, it could be worse.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.071
I heard VegasAir
has a staircase fee

02:51.104 --> 02:52.373
just to get off the plane.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.309
DAVE:
This is your captain here

02:55.343 --> 02:56.710
with a little reminder.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.712
Now that marijuana's legal
in Vegas,

02:58.746 --> 03:01.382
you deserve to treat
yourself to a little puff,

03:01.415 --> 03:04.385
a Korean massage and a sandwich.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.488
So head on down to
Kim Bong Dill's Dispensary,

03:07.521 --> 03:09.690
Spa and Deli.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.560
Supreme leader says,
"It's the bomb."

03:12.593 --> 03:15.429
GWEN :
Jackpot 529, winds 280 at ten.

03:15.463 --> 03:16.997
Should be a smooth flight.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.167
It is, now that I'm
talking to you, Gwen.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.002
GWEN: Always the charmer,
Captain Dave.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.404
Once you get to Vegas,
feel free

03:23.437 --> 03:24.872
to buzz my tower and say hi.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.574
Will do.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.209
I'll be the handsome brunette
flying a plane.

03:31.279 --> 03:33.714
I think ATC Gwen likes you.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.549
Nah, she's just
a flirt, that one.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.719
I don't know, she doesn't talk
to other pilots like that.

03:38.752 --> 03:39.887
You should ask her out.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.555
: Yeah, right.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.057
A pilot dating an
air traffic controller?

03:45.092 --> 03:46.727
Can you imagine?

03:46.760 --> 03:50.130
Yeah. It wasn't that hard.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.036
Hey, as a frequent flyer,
I'm used to this plane

03:56.069 --> 03:58.406
being a capitalist hell state,

03:58.439 --> 04:01.709
but I'm swiping my credit card
and my seat won't recline.

04:01.742 --> 04:05.245
Oh, it looks like the guy
behind you paid double

04:05.279 --> 04:06.880
to keep yours
in the upright position.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.316
Well, in that case,
how much would it cost

04:08.349 --> 04:09.750
to scream into a pillow?

04:09.783 --> 04:14.422
Um... Nothing to scream,
but a pillow is ten dollars.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.089
Oh! I take it back,
screaming is five.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.959
I'll pay $50 for a drinks cart
to block my view of those two.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.596
You want to know the most
disgusting part about them?

04:22.630 --> 04:25.333
I saw it. He touched his
armrest, then touched her face.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.468
Best she can hope for now
is debilitating pinkeye.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.438
No. That guy's cheating
on his wife, and that poor girl

04:30.471 --> 04:31.439
probably has no idea.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.573
He's not wearing
his wedding ring.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.141
Wedding rings
don't mean anything.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.109
Rock Hudson had one,
and I had Rock Hudson.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.144
How old are you?

04:37.177 --> 04:39.179
Nichole, you're a woman.
Back me up here.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.782
Your generation
is so obsessed with labels.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.283
But, yes, as a cis female

04:43.317 --> 04:46.787
polyamory-tolerant monogamist,
I find cheating repulsive.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.657
But, as a stripper, cheating
is the backbone of my industry,

04:49.690 --> 04:52.326
-and mama can recline her chair
all she wants.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.628
This whole thing
is disgusting. -Thank you.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.464
They make you pay now
just to recline your seat.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.499
Back in the old days, we'd carve
our complimentary roast beef

04:58.532 --> 04:59.800
right in the aisle.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.602
I'm losing track
of this conversation.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.804
Let's everybody go around
and say what we're angry about.

05:03.837 --> 05:08.376
So far, I've got cheating,
gender labels and roast beef.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.210
-OTHER: Yes.
-Okay, good to know.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.147
Hey, Ronovan.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.352
-Mm-hmm.

05:18.386 --> 05:21.389
Let's say there's a woman
I know, professionally,

05:21.422 --> 05:24.558
and... wanted to ask her out.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.226
-No.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.161
Let's say it was okay.

05:28.195 --> 05:31.164
How would I, you know, do that?

05:31.198 --> 05:33.033
-Ask her out.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.136
I'm about to be brave

05:36.169 --> 05:38.539
and tell you something
personal here.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.041
You see, I haven't asked
a woman out on a date

05:41.074 --> 05:42.410
since my last divorce.

05:42.443 --> 05:45.178
Oh, you're a good person
to ask about this.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.080
Didn't all your ex-wives
cheat on you?

05:47.114 --> 05:49.082
Yes, that's right.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.552
So, if there had been someone
to expose the situation,

05:51.585 --> 05:53.421
that would've been
a good thing, right?

05:53.454 --> 05:56.890
Well, yeah, that's why
for number three, I hired a P.I.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.826
But he just got himself
in on the action.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.060
This is helpful. Thanks, Dave.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.895
Wait, we never talked about me.

06:01.929 --> 06:06.033
Oh, you having trouble
tricking woman into love.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.034
Listen.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.402
Here's what you say:

06:08.436 --> 06:11.705
"I spend most of my time in the
clouds, but you are real angel."

06:11.739 --> 06:13.441
I'm not taking love advice

06:13.474 --> 06:16.410
from someone who mixes
tomato juice and iced tea.

06:16.444 --> 06:20.347
I don't mix.
I stir with a tiny sword.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.882
So you're just gonna
walk right up

06:21.915 --> 06:23.451
to that girl and tell her
he's married?

06:23.484 --> 06:25.352
Have you considered she might
already know and doesn't care?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.386
Oh, now you're being rational?

06:26.420 --> 06:27.755
Last week,
you tried to get someone

06:27.788 --> 06:29.623
kicked off the plane
for watching La La Land.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.359
I don't need Ryan Gosling
to whitesplain jazz to me.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.294
I'm overhearing all this.
I'm not eavesdropping.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.730
You're both screaming,
and it all sounds terrible.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.131
Okay, intervening
in other people's lives

06:38.165 --> 06:41.635
is such a poor idea, I'm
actually ignoring my own advice

06:41.669 --> 06:43.303
to intervene and tell you that.

06:43.336 --> 06:46.206
How come when I butt into
other people's lives, I'm nosy,

06:46.239 --> 06:47.708
but when Bernard does it,
he's charming?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.209
Well, it's just
a likability issue.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.211
Look, I know you think
you're being helpful,

06:51.244 --> 06:53.313
but it's not your place
to tell this woman anything.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.783
-You're her flight attendant,
not her friend. -Up here,

06:55.816 --> 06:59.453
I'm friend, bartender,
human rights champion.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.755
That African-American man
wanted to sit in the back row.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.491
He was with his friends.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.793
Look, this girl deserves to know
what she's getting involved in.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.327
I'm trying to help her.

07:07.360 --> 07:11.064
Just watch, I'm gonna save her
20s without her even noticing.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.299
No, Ro...

07:13.667 --> 07:16.303
Hi, let me know if
you guys need anything.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.872
Oh, that's a nice shirt.
Did your wife get that for you?

07:20.641 --> 07:22.342
Did you see that?

07:22.375 --> 07:24.444
I just lit the fuse
on a ticking time bomb.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.013
If it's a time bomb,
it wouldn't have a fuse.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.314
Yeah, I believe
it would have a timer.

07:27.347 --> 07:28.482
Okay, then I lit the timer.
Who cares?

07:28.516 --> 07:30.150
Just watch.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.789
Looks like the fuse went out.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.324
We just agreed
it didn't have a fuse.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.827
Perhaps we should all stop
talking about bombs?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.662
-BERNARD: Yeah.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.337
-Okay, that's enough
screen time for you.

07:50.370 --> 07:53.006
GWEN:
Hey there, JP 529.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.374
Hey, Gwen.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.442
Where you been?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.811
Cheating on me
with other planes?

07:57.845 --> 07:59.312
No way.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.714
You know I'm a Jackpot girl.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.783
I bet you say that
to all the airlines.

08:04.317 --> 08:08.455
GWEN: I'm gonna need you to turn
right heading 060.

08:08.488 --> 08:11.124
As you wish.

08:11.158 --> 08:14.461
Anyway, I was thinking,
and call me a relief pitcher,

08:14.494 --> 08:16.997
because this is coming
out of left field...

08:17.998 --> 08:19.567
...I spend all my time

08:19.600 --> 08:22.870
with angels in the clouds--

08:22.903 --> 08:24.137
anyway, nothing.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.575
Did you just have a stroke?

08:29.209 --> 08:30.644
DAVE: You're not supposed
to be in here,

08:30.678 --> 08:32.345
so let's make this quick.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.381
I just need you
to help me ask out Gwen.

08:34.414 --> 08:37.017
Okay. You do like this:

08:37.050 --> 08:41.488
"Gwen, I'm not a man
who easily says feelings.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.858
"But when that flying
love baby hits you,

08:44.892 --> 08:46.426
"you have to answer the call.

08:46.459 --> 08:51.264
"I believe the airplane gods
connected us for a purpose,

08:51.298 --> 08:54.735
and that purpose is for
the making of love."

08:56.770 --> 08:58.606
Hey, Gwen.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.841
This is Jackpot Five-Two-Niner,

09:00.874 --> 09:03.877
just letting you know that I'm
not a guy who opens up easily,

09:03.911 --> 09:07.915
but when you're shot by
Cupid's arrow, you have to act.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.717
"Cupid." That is name.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.352
I think this universe put us
on this radio for a reason.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.088
And that reason
is to take you out

09:15.122 --> 09:16.924
for a steak dinner tonight.

09:16.957 --> 09:21.094
You don't have to answer
right now, just think about it.

09:22.763 --> 09:23.731
How does it feel?

09:23.764 --> 09:26.099
Feels good.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.868
In fact, it feels real good.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.939
Okay, because you just said that
to the whole plane.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.206
DAVE :
...is to take you out

09:33.240 --> 09:35.475
for a steak dinner tonight.

09:35.508 --> 09:38.445
You don't have to answer
right now, just think about it.

09:38.478 --> 09:41.114
You can get out now.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.618
Please, can I stay until a bird
explodes on the windshield?

09:44.652 --> 09:47.120
-Get out.
-Come on, Dave.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.757
We talked about this.
No passengers in the cockpit.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.660
I guess I'm wrong.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.795
Maybe she does already know
he's married.

09:56.296 --> 09:59.099
Or maybe she had earbuds in
and didn't even hear me.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.134
-I have another chance.
-Oh, please don't.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.971
Secondhand embarrassment
kills 13 Englishmen a year.

10:04.004 --> 10:07.074
So what? I'm just supposed
to sit back and do nothing,

10:07.107 --> 10:09.910
while that poor, naive girl
falls deeper into love?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.578
With no idea that the reason

10:11.611 --> 10:14.247
her name is "IKEA" in that guy's
phone is not a cute reference

10:14.281 --> 10:15.649
to where they first had sex,

10:15.683 --> 10:17.651
but to hide her
from his chiropractor wife,

10:17.685 --> 10:19.820
and by the way,
if he ever thinks

10:19.853 --> 10:21.354
he's getting
his Jethro Tull T-shirt back,

10:21.388 --> 10:22.823
he's out of his mind.

10:22.856 --> 10:23.824
Excuse me.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.793
Oddly specific.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.127
Who was he?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.996
His name was Eric.

10:29.029 --> 10:31.264
I met him in junior college
in Bakersfield.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.266
He was older.
Swept me off my feet.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.935
Vacations, fancy dinners.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.370
Those movies where the actors
are, like, right there.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.939
You know they're called plays.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.340
Anyway, I dropped out of school,

10:40.373 --> 10:41.942
and moved to L.A.
to be with him,

10:41.975 --> 10:45.312
only he was a little
too busy... with his wife.

10:46.680 --> 10:47.981
Do you know
what I would've given

10:48.015 --> 10:49.950
to have someone
who could've warned me?

10:49.983 --> 10:53.553
I feel terrible
that that happened to you,

10:53.586 --> 10:55.455
but even if this were
any of our business--

10:55.488 --> 10:57.791
which again, to be clear,
it's absolutely not--

10:57.825 --> 10:59.459
this is hardly the time
or the place

10:59.492 --> 11:01.795
to be delivering
such delicate news.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.663
I mean, for God's sake,
we're three feet away

11:03.697 --> 11:06.199
from a Captain Jack Sparrow
impersonator.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.501
For legal purposes,

11:08.535 --> 11:10.738
I'm just
a "gender-fluid rum pirate."

11:10.771 --> 11:12.806
Fine. God, I liked you better
when you kept

11:12.840 --> 11:14.708
your rational ideas to yourself.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.011
Okay, so from my experience,

11:18.045 --> 11:19.479
the way to get
a woman's attention

11:19.512 --> 11:21.148
is to completely ignore her.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.349
Or buy her an island.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.650
Like a kitchen island?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.152
No, like an island island.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.821
Like, "Treasure" or "Long."

11:27.855 --> 11:30.824
GWEN: Vegas approach,
Jackpot 529, level 15,000.

11:30.858 --> 11:34.594
Wait, no, this is your chance.
Just play it cool, don't answer.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.663
GWEN:
Jackpot 529?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.766
529, can you hear me?

11:38.799 --> 11:42.770
529, are you there?

11:42.803 --> 11:45.739
Dave? Dave.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.508
Oh, my God. We've lost comm
with Jackpot 529.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.344
No, we're here.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.679
We're fine.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.082
JK, JK.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.683
GWEN: What the hell
is going on there?

11:56.716 --> 11:57.885
Why did you answer?

11:57.918 --> 12:00.687
You totally had her.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.956
You know we're charging
to lower tray tables now?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.792
They've taken all the dignity
out of flying.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.226
Judy Garland once said

12:06.259 --> 12:08.095
she had the best bowel movement
of her life

12:08.128 --> 12:11.264
after eating a salmon mousse
on a TWA flight to Paris.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.632
Now look what we've become.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.969
DYANA:
Excuse me.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.437
Oh, hi.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.439
This is embarrassing
to ask, but...

12:19.472 --> 12:21.608
am I doing something wrong?

12:21.641 --> 12:23.410
Wow. Okay.

12:23.443 --> 12:27.380
I-I mean, I know that it's not
really my place to say anything,

12:27.414 --> 12:30.450
but I know when it happened
to me, I blamed myself

12:30.483 --> 12:31.718
for a really long time.

12:31.751 --> 12:36.323
So I guess my question is,
how much do you know?

12:37.791 --> 12:40.293
I know that the little slide
says "vacant,"

12:40.327 --> 12:41.895
but I can't get the door open.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.596
Am I, am I doing
something wrong?

12:43.630 --> 12:45.132
: Oh. No, yeah.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.900
I mean-- well, I mean, no,
you're not, you're not.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.601
It's-- we, um, we're just...
we're charging 50 cents

12:48.635 --> 12:49.769
to use the bathroom now.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.439
Or you could get a potty pass
for $9.99.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.440
But you know what?

12:53.473 --> 12:54.942
This one, um...

12:54.975 --> 12:56.176
-This is on me.
-Thank you.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.146
-Yeah.
-Wait. I'm sorry.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.181
What did you think
I was talking about?

13:01.214 --> 13:03.016
What's that?

13:04.517 --> 13:06.486
-Sure.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.322
Before you judge me,
I'm gonna start at the end.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.491
She is so happy
I said something.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.026
Something to who about what?

13:13.060 --> 13:14.995
Dyana, the mistress.
I told her Dean is married.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.297
And then, we planned a lunch,
but I'm probably gonna cancel.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.531
You told her?

13:18.565 --> 13:20.033
Didn't we agree
that was a bad idea?

13:20.067 --> 13:21.201
It just happened.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.203
We had this delightful bathroom
misunderstanding,

13:23.236 --> 13:25.005
and we started talking,
and then we were hugging,

13:25.038 --> 13:26.606
and then she got mascara
on my shoulder,

13:26.639 --> 13:28.976
which I said don't worry about,
but it does kind of bother me.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.610
"Mascara on my Shoulder."

13:30.643 --> 13:32.980
Isn't that the title
of a Joan Collins memoir?

13:33.013 --> 13:34.982
Now, is that a real question,
or a burn?

13:35.015 --> 13:36.984
I honestly have
no idea with him.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.719
She was upset, yes,
but she was also so sweet,

13:39.752 --> 13:41.188
and so grateful
to know the truth,

13:41.221 --> 13:42.990
and maybe I will
do that lunch with her.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.058
And you're okay being trapped
with these people

13:45.092 --> 13:47.560
in an enclosed space
20,000 feet up?

13:47.594 --> 13:49.562
She promised that she wouldn't
say anything until we landed,

13:49.596 --> 13:51.464
and that she'd totally
leave me out of it.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.300
You're married?
You son of a bitch!

13:53.333 --> 13:54.467
What?

13:54.501 --> 13:56.203
-Her.

13:58.071 --> 14:02.175
Well, that lunch is totally off.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.147
I have no idea
what she's talking about.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.481
Oh, really?
Why would she lie to me?

14:08.515 --> 14:09.883
DEAN:
I have no-- I don't know.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.920
Hey, Kelly. Gary.
Anything to drink?

14:13.887 --> 14:14.988
Okay.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.489
Artem. You want some pretzels?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.558
Hey, I'm sorry, Ronald, but
I would prefer you stay out

14:18.591 --> 14:20.227
of my personal business, okay?

14:20.260 --> 14:21.895
Are pretzels that personal?

14:21.929 --> 14:24.932
Yeah, the way I eat them,
they are. Oh, yes.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.901
Hey, what's going on?

14:27.935 --> 14:29.669
All the passengers
are acting so weird.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.371
Can you blame them?
They just saw what happens

14:31.404 --> 14:33.106
when you let Hurricane Ronnie
into your life.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.109
No, I was trying to help.
Nichole, you get that, right?

14:36.143 --> 14:38.445
Please don't tell my dad
I strip at Grapefruits.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.280
Also, don't tell Grapefruits
I love my dad.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.949
It's a real bummer
for customers.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.617
No, I... I thought
I was doing something good.

14:44.651 --> 14:47.120
I love my passengers.
They're my people.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.189
I mean... look.
James, hey,

14:49.222 --> 14:51.191
I-I wrote down the name
of your hotel again

14:51.224 --> 14:52.592
in case you lost the first one.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.262
I don't want it.
Take this.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.464
It's a note for you to give
to sober me,

14:57.497 --> 15:00.767
telling drunk me not to let you
give me notes anymore.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.038
GWEN:
Hey there, Jackpot,

15:05.072 --> 15:06.873
you're cleared I-L-S
two-eight right for landing.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.709
Copy that, and can I just
add congratulations

15:09.742 --> 15:11.945
on being a strong woman
in the workplace?

15:11.979 --> 15:14.214
Aw, thanks.

15:14.247 --> 15:17.317
So, I guess it's time
to sign off?

15:17.350 --> 15:20.687
Come on, Captain, ask her out.
She's your sky-mate.

15:24.491 --> 15:27.760
Captain Dave likes you and
he wants to ask you out. Bye.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.263
Sorry, Jackpot,
could you repeat?

15:30.297 --> 15:33.600
Uh, yeah, Gwen.

15:33.633 --> 15:37.270
There's a bar in terminal "C"
next to the noodle place

15:37.304 --> 15:39.072
with the great...

15:39.106 --> 15:41.108
-...noodles.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.244
-DAVE: Would you want to go

15:44.277 --> 15:46.779
and grab a drink with me
when we land?

15:46.813 --> 15:49.616
It's about time you asked.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.785
Copy that.
And prepare for landing.

15:52.819 --> 15:56.756
Hey! Captain Dave!

15:56.789 --> 15:58.491
I knew you had it in you.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.527
Hey, I've been out of the game
for a minute.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.197
How far do people go
on first dates these days?

16:04.231 --> 16:06.466
I've heard butts
are very popular right now.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.668
Still here, Jackpot.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.306
Thank you.
Thank you for flying Jackpot.

16:13.340 --> 16:17.577
I'm still your friend-- you can
trust me with your secrets.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.549
Hey. Black coffee,
two sugars to go?

16:22.582 --> 16:24.184
I don't know who the hell
you think you are,

16:24.217 --> 16:26.519
but what I do is
none of your business.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.488
What, you think just because
we fly on the same plane,

16:28.521 --> 16:31.524
that you have this unique
insight into our lives?

16:31.558 --> 16:33.326
That's pathetic.
You are a nobody

16:33.360 --> 16:35.128
to the people on this plane.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.864
And when we want something from
you, we'll hit the call button.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.499
I'm sorry, is there a problem?

16:39.532 --> 16:40.667
Stay out of it, Frenchie.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.535
:
Frenchie?

16:42.569 --> 16:45.972
Hey. Hey, hey.
Um, you all right?

16:46.005 --> 16:48.908
Mm-hmm. Yeah, oh,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.210
I just...

16:50.243 --> 16:52.011
You were right,
I was really stupid

16:52.045 --> 16:54.547
to get involved is all, I...

16:54.581 --> 16:56.083
Excuse me.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.688
Oh, my God.

17:08.561 --> 17:11.931
Um, hi. Excuse me.
Uh, yeah, you.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.033
Um, I don't know exactly
what it is you said

17:14.067 --> 17:15.902
to that flight attendant
back there,

17:15.935 --> 17:17.904
but she's pretty shaken up,
so I think...

17:17.937 --> 17:19.572
What is it with all you people?

17:19.606 --> 17:22.075
Why can't anybody on that plane
mind their own business?

17:22.109 --> 17:24.010
Hey, buddy,
I'm the lord chancellor

17:24.043 --> 17:26.579
of "mind your own business,"
but that woman you accosted,

17:26.613 --> 17:28.281
she is my business.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.583
So, if you were any kind of man,
you would go back in there

17:30.617 --> 17:32.185
and you'd apologize.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.221
Oh, I will show you exactly
what kind of man I am

17:34.254 --> 17:37.357
if you don't get out of my face,
Gérard Depardieu.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.026
Gérard Depar...
I'm clearly English.

17:40.059 --> 17:44.097
You, on the other hand, you're
a bully and a philanderer.

17:44.131 --> 17:46.133
I really wish you didn't
just poke me.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.434
What are you gonna do?

17:47.467 --> 17:48.601
You gonna hit me?

17:48.635 --> 17:50.637
No, I'm gonna detain you.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.574
DEAN: You have no idea who
you're dealing with, buddy.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.376
Whoa, what's going on?

17:56.409 --> 17:58.445
Did Frenchie do something wrong?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.447
COLIN: What? I'm the one
being assaulted.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.081
Yeah, by an air marshal.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.583
Wait, you're an air marshal?

18:03.616 --> 18:06.819
Yes. And that woman I've been
flying out with every week

18:06.853 --> 18:08.721
was my trainee.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.923
Dyana is my girlfriend.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.392
Huh.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.227
Oh, my God,
that is the first time

18:14.261 --> 18:16.095
you called me your girlfriend.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.331
Well, that's what you are, baby.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.434
COLIN:
Aw, that's nice.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.005
I have a date tonight, too.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.913
So, the good news is
they're letting you go

18:33.946 --> 18:35.848
with a stern warning.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.484
Bad news is we have definitely

18:37.517 --> 18:39.519
ruined the start
of Dean's vacation.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.121
You know, as I sit here, rapidly
losing feeling in my hands,

18:42.155 --> 18:43.623
it does occur to me:

18:43.656 --> 18:45.758
shouldn't you know
the air marshals on board?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.694
They stopped telling me
and Bernard a while ago

18:47.727 --> 18:49.596
because we were abusing
the system.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.998
Can I have a coffee and a water?

18:52.031 --> 18:54.834
Hey, Air Marshal,
you need to tase this bitch.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.870
For what it's worth, thank you

18:57.904 --> 18:59.872
for sticking up for me
like that.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.108
It was kind of badass
hearing you be all like,

19:02.141 --> 19:03.643
:
"She is my business."

19:03.676 --> 19:05.678
-French.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.113
Clearly.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.816
But really, I appreciate it.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.619
Especially since I alienated
everyone else on the plane.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.521
So much for saying
they're my people.

19:14.554 --> 19:18.358
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm still your people.

19:20.159 --> 19:24.030
Anyway, consider confronting
that air marshal as my apology

19:24.063 --> 19:26.966
on behalf of men everywhere
for Eric,

19:26.999 --> 19:29.068
the chiropractor's husband.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.238
Well, in a way,
Eric did me a favor.

19:31.271 --> 19:34.241
If I hadn't followed him to
L.A., I probably would have just

19:34.274 --> 19:37.344
stayed in Bakersfield, married
a guy with a neck tattoo,

19:37.377 --> 19:39.812
who eventually gets pinched
for driving the getaway car

19:39.846 --> 19:41.381
in an avocado heist.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.882
Again, oddly specific.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.484
His name was Randall.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.752
Yes.

19:51.458 --> 19:52.892
Is she here yet?

19:52.925 --> 19:55.562
I don't know. I have no idea
what she looks like.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.397
Hey, wait, are you allowed
to be back there?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.966
Jill loves it when I sling.
Don't you, Jill?

20:02.402 --> 20:05.838
Excuse me,
are you Captain Dave Pratman?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.440
What?!
You've been catfished.

20:07.474 --> 20:11.911
Listen, I've been on both sides
catfish many times.

20:11.944 --> 20:15.715
But... remember, this man
is hurting more than you.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.918
No. I'm Gwen's supervisor
from air traffic control.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.853
Gwen's not gonna
make it tonight.

20:20.887 --> 20:24.090
Oh, my God, was she on her way
here, but then got hit by a car

20:24.123 --> 20:25.358
and was horribly disfigured,

20:25.392 --> 20:27.026
and is now too embarrassed
to see him?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.929
That's so romantic. Tell her
to come, he'll love her anyway.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.198
Whoa, not so fast.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.033
Just how broken
is her face, Doc?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.568
What is wrong with you people?

20:35.602 --> 20:36.803
She was not in an accident.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.738
Gwen's filling out
citation paperwork.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.973
Your conduct today was
thoroughly unprofessional.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.375
A lot of people
were on that channel.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.410
What were you thinking?

20:43.443 --> 20:45.077
We were thinking
this is still a world

20:45.111 --> 20:46.946
where true love exists,
you bastard.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.715
It's okay.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.283
She's getting off
with a warning.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.151
But from now on, that radio
is just for ATC guidance only.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.453
Understand?

20:53.486 --> 20:58.291
I do. That's the end
for Gwen and Captain Dave.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.560
It was beautiful
while it lasted.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.763
Turns out we were just two
planes crossing in the night.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.766
Or just call her on the phone
like a normal person.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.101
Here's her number.
Stop being a weirdo.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.971
See you tonight, Nichole.

21:12.004 --> 21:14.674
Bye, Lewis.
Remember to eat a light dinner!

21:14.707 --> 21:17.310
Well, look at that.

21:17.344 --> 21:21.147
Turns out old Captain Dave's
still got it.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.515
So, when do I call?

21:22.549 --> 21:25.051
-Right now. -20 days.
-Never. I still think catfish.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.290
What's going on?

21:31.324 --> 21:32.659
Oh, you got your wish.

21:32.692 --> 21:34.193
Jackpot had so many complaints,
they're getting rid of

21:34.226 --> 21:35.628
all the credit card swipers.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.597
Plus, everyone's identities
were stolen.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.367
Well, at least they brought some
of the dignity back to flying.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.168
Yeah, they found another way
to make money.

21:42.201 --> 21:45.438
For a small fee, Jackpot
passengers can now purchase

21:45.472 --> 21:46.706
in-flight flu shots.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.351
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

22:00.587 --> 22:02.689
You've hit the jackpot
with LA to Vegas.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.091
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:07.594 --> 22:09.161
It's time we fly
this old bird.

22:09.195 --> 22:12.131
* It feels good *

22:12.164 --> 22:15.034
MULDER: I want to believe.
I would just like to see.

22:15.067 --> 22:15.868
I can help you.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.837
* It feels good *

22:17.870 --> 22:19.472
-You want to do
the honors, Alan?
-Yeah!

22:19.506 --> 22:20.840
No, you never
touch this.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.642
* You know it feels good *

22:22.675 --> 22:24.243
-* It feels good *

22:24.276 --> 22:26.212
* Oh, you know it feels good *

22:26.245 --> 22:28.314
Let's do it.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.617
Everything you thought
you knew about medicine
is wrong.

22:33.753 --> 22:34.687
Unbelievable.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.288
* It feels good *
