WEBVTT

00:14.180 --> 00:15.974
Did you get it yet?

00:16.056 --> 00:17.434
No.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.728
{\an3}Now I'm six and
a half days late.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.604
That's not that bad;
I've been later than that.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.732
Yeah, but you're
a virgin, Donna.

00:23.815 --> 00:24.983
There's a big difference.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.110
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.570
Look, stop driving
yourself crazy.

00:28.653 --> 00:30.155
{\an1}It may not mean
anything.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.531
What if it does?

00:31.614 --> 00:33.825
Just give it aWhy?tle more time.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.660
{\an6}You're acting like
I should pretend like
this isn't happening,

00:35.744 --> 00:37.203
{\an3}but what if I am
pregnant? What then?

00:37.287 --> 00:39.164
I just think you should relax.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.499
It's practically
impossible anyway.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.793
{\an1}You use a condom
every time.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.044
Right?

00:46.546 --> 00:47.964
Oh, great.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.507
Now do you see
why I'm so scared?

00:49.591 --> 00:51.468
How could you take that risk?

00:51.551 --> 00:53.219
No, especially
after Jimmy.ow.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.679
Kelly, he died of AIDS.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.556
Didn't that teach you anything?

00:56.639 --> 00:58.558
Donna, don't lecture me, okay?

00:58.641 --> 01:00.810
I was tested.
Brandon was tested.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.687
We were both negative.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.147
I know there's still a risk,
but I was just sure

01:05.230 --> 01:07.317
{\an1}it was the wrong time
of the month, you know?

01:07.400 --> 01:09.152
I don't know,
I don't know.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.279
It was just
that one time though.

01:13.072 --> 01:15.158
Why is this happening?

01:19.078 --> 01:21.539
It's gonna be okay.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.463
♪ ♪

01:54.948 --> 01:56.950
♪ ♪

02:20.890 --> 02:22.725
♪ ♪

02:54.132 --> 02:57.302
♪ ♪

03:22.243 --> 03:23.912
Stress relief, huh?

03:23.995 --> 03:26.205
Yeah, I think so.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.959
{\an3}Hey, bud, what're
you doing?

03:30.043 --> 03:32.086
Just packing some stuff up.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.922
I hope my mom likes
her Mother's Day present.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.465
It doesn't look cheap,
does it?

03:35.548 --> 03:37.091
I don't know.
Was it cheap?

03:37.175 --> 03:38.468
Hell no.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.970
This aromatherapy garbage
cost a fortune.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.305
{\an3}Well, then she'll
love it.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.140
No, she won't.

03:44.223 --> 03:46.809
{\an3}My mother never
loves my presents.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.938
{\an3}She'll pretend she does,
but she's an actress.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.105
And a professional one, no less.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.024
The thing I always liked
about my mother

03:53.107 --> 03:55.068
was that she always liked my
Mother's Day presents--

03:55.151 --> 03:56.027
no matter how stupid they were.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.321
When I was five,
I gave her a dead centipede.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.156
She kept it in the fridge
for weeks.

04:00.239 --> 04:01.658
(sighs)

04:01.741 --> 04:03.618
{\an3}Oh, that's the key to
your high self-esteem--

04:03.701 --> 04:04.994
unconditional motherly love.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.996
Your mother loves you.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.790
{\an3}Yeah, in kind of a
critical way though.

04:08.873 --> 04:11.167
I always feel she thinks
I could do things better.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.293
Maybe you could do
things better.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.170
She's not the only one

04:14.253 --> 04:15.755
who thinks there's room
for improvement.

04:15.838 --> 04:17.464
Let me guess-- Clare?

04:17.548 --> 04:18.757
{\an3}Yeah.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.135
Everything I do is wrong.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.138
I buy her roses,
it's the wrong color.

04:24.222 --> 04:24.973
{\an3}Did you know
that pink roses

04:25.056 --> 04:27.058
aren't as passionate
as red roses?

04:27.141 --> 04:29.060
Oh, yeah. Everybody knows that.

04:29.143 --> 04:30.561
{\an3}Since when?

04:30.645 --> 04:31.980
Since forever.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.064
Bro, what's with
the two of you?

04:33.147 --> 04:35.233
All you do is fight.

04:35.316 --> 04:38.903
Ever since my mom broke up
with her dad, oh, it's bad.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.572
She blames my mom,
I'm forced to defend her.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.574
It's getting ugly.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.244
Well, maybe it's time for the
two of you to break up.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.287
What's the big
attraction anyway?

04:48.371 --> 04:51.374
The make-up sex,
it's pretty righteous.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.090
{\an3}Please tell Kelly that
her father sends his love

04:59.173 --> 05:00.758
{\an3}and I cannot
wait to meet her.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.093
Sure.

05:02.176 --> 05:05.054
Bottom line--

05:05.138 --> 05:07.098
I'm more concerned about
your bottom line

05:07.181 --> 05:08.433
than I am about your friend's

05:08.516 --> 05:10.268
or my boss' daughter.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.896
Well, uh, so how
is my bottom line?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.898
Not as healthy
as it could be.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.400
Well, the club's doing great.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.901
Oh, don't get me wrong.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.236
You have a great place,

05:20.319 --> 05:21.404
you seem to have
great headliners,

05:21.487 --> 05:23.072
{\an3}but you're tying up
your cash here.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.032
For the amount invested

05:24.115 --> 05:25.742
you could be getting a much
bigger return.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.243
So you're saying
I should sell the club?

05:27.326 --> 05:29.704
We'll talk about it over dinner.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.080
No, no, no. Tell me now.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.584
Valerie, from what I can tell,

05:34.667 --> 05:37.587
you've only got about
ten grand liquid.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.214
Now, even if you are his
daughter's best friend,

05:40.298 --> 05:41.758
{\an3}Bill will not talk
to you unless

05:41.841 --> 05:43.426
you're sitting on
at least 100 G's.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.762
Well, the club is worth
much more than that.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.097
Cash. In escrow
with the company.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.266
Valerie, I'm not
pressuring you.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.934
You called us.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.061
No, I know.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.604
And I want to do this, I do.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.273
It's just... I don't know who'd
want to buy the club.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.733
It could take a long time.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.068
{\an3}Well, maybe your
other partner.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.152
David Silver?

06:01.235 --> 06:03.237
Maybe, but I don't know why

06:03.321 --> 06:06.115
he'd want to buy me out.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.950
You have to make him want to.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.285
Well, how?

06:09.368 --> 06:11.579
There's always a way.

06:11.662 --> 06:15.249
{\an3}Think about it
for a while.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.335
I'll see you tonight.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.101
{\an1}Hi..

06:33.184 --> 06:34.310
Glad I caught you.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.479
I was looking all over
for you at the library.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.106
Yeah, I'm sorry.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.067
{\an1}I thought you were gonna help
me out at the club today.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.276
Oh, God, I totally forgot.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.028
I can't. I told, Kelly...

06:44.112 --> 06:46.280
{\an3}that actually, I have
to study for this final

06:46.364 --> 06:48.282
in Langely's class.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.952
I mean, you know she
You know, Donna, it's Saturday.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.204
{\an4}You might want to give
yourself a little bit
of a break.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.666
Hey. You ready to go home?

06:56.749 --> 06:59.127
Yeah.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.504
Ah. I thought you had to study.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.630
DONNA:
I do. That's why

07:02.713 --> 07:03.631
we're going home.

07:03.714 --> 07:05.007
{\an1}Oh.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.342
But I'll see you tonight.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.219
Okay. Am I gonna
see you tonight?

07:08.302 --> 07:09.220
Yeah, Val, mentioned it,

07:09.303 --> 07:11.556
but I think the less I see
of her the better.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.683
{\an1}Kel, come on,
this is a huge act.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.810
I mean, this isn't just
Val's club, it's my club, too.

07:15.893 --> 07:18.688
Okay. But can you tell Val
to stay home?

07:18.771 --> 07:21.023
No, but I'll make sure

07:21.107 --> 07:22.900
{\an1}she's on her
Thanks.havior.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.069
{\an1}Bye.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.029
Did you get it?

07:27.113 --> 07:28.739
{\an3}Yeah.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.576
I can't believe that they
sell home pregnancy tests

07:31.659 --> 07:34.203
{\an3}right here in
the student store.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.247
I can't do this here.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.624
Well, come on,
let's go Okay.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.920
(knocking)

07:43.004 --> 07:45.047
{\an1}Clare, hey, I'm just
on my way out. What's up?

07:45.131 --> 07:46.257
Is Steve home?

07:46.340 --> 07:48.217
{\an1}Yeah, he's upstairs
taking a shower. Go on up.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.595
{\an3}Actually could you, could
you grab him for me?

07:50.678 --> 07:52.305
Thanks.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.431
You okay?

07:53.514 --> 07:54.765
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.185
I'm just gonna wait
in the living room.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.195
(Steve humming tune)

08:08.654 --> 08:10.531
{\an1}(chuckles)

08:10.615 --> 08:13.034
{\an3}Hey, Steve,
Clare's downstairs.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.702
Tell her to come up.

08:14.785 --> 08:15.912
{\an3}I did. She
doesn't want to.

08:15.995 --> 08:18.206
This is gonna be
a bad day, isn't it?

08:18.289 --> 08:19.790
(phone ringing)

08:19.874 --> 08:21.125
That's me.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.420
BRANDON:
Hello.

08:24.503 --> 08:25.713
Hi.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.715
Hey, babe.
What's going on with Clare?

08:27.798 --> 08:29.217
I don't know. I left
before she got up. Why?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.301
I don't know.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.428
She just looks kind of sad,
that's all. What's up?

08:32.510 --> 08:35.222
Brandon, can you skip
the library today?

08:35.306 --> 08:37.808
You dWhat's going on?t...

08:37.892 --> 08:38.726
You don't sound so good.

08:38.808 --> 08:40.770
Just come over.

08:40.852 --> 08:41.979
Is this about Valerie?

08:42.063 --> 08:43.731
For once, no.

08:43.813 --> 08:44.774
All right.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.442
Are you okay?

08:46.525 --> 08:47.777
Yeah. Just hurry.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.278
I'm on my way.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.451
(sighs)

08:55.534 --> 08:57.745
What am I going to tell him?

08:57.828 --> 08:59.789
Well, hopefully, you won't
have to tell him anything,

08:59.872 --> 09:01.499
{\an3}except that it was
a false alarm.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.668
I know I said I wanted to know,

09:03.751 --> 09:07.797
{\an1}but now that I have this in my
hand, it's like a time bomb.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.298
{\an1}Up until the moment
I take the test,

09:09.382 --> 09:11.467
{\an1}I can just pretend like none
of this is happening,

09:11.550 --> 09:18.933
but if this comes back positive,
there's no turning back.

09:21.602 --> 09:24.313
{\an3}I wish I could
say I understand.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.773
But how can I?

09:25.856 --> 09:27.608
You're my best friend.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.651
You're helping me.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.279
Okay.

09:31.362 --> 09:35.199
{\an3}Well, it, uh, it almost
happened last week.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.701
{\an1}What did?

09:36.784 --> 09:39.662
I almost had sex with
David in New Orleans.

09:39.745 --> 09:40.830
But I didn't.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.873
You're lucky.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.042
You're never gonna have
to deal with any of this.

09:45.126 --> 09:46.252
You'll get married,

09:46.335 --> 09:48.963
and if you get pregnant, it will
be because you want to be.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.132
I guess.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.134
Sometimes, I just feel like

09:53.217 --> 09:55.052
the oldest virgin
in the whole world.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.179
Don't say that.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.640
You're doing the right thing.

09:59.724 --> 10:03.311
Sometimes I wish I had a code
to live by, you know.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.062
No, that just seems
the easy way out.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.689
You know, do as you're told

10:06.772 --> 10:09.025
and then you don't ever have
to make a brave decision

10:09.108 --> 10:10.276
your whole life.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.570
I think you're the bravest
person I know.

10:12.653 --> 10:14.280
Thank you.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.823
Hey, I have an idea.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.576
Why don't you put in a few
good words for me upstairs.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.536
I'll make him a deal.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.040
I'm not pregnant, and I will
become a practicing Catholic.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.333
Nope, won't work.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.709
God doesn't make deals.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.878
Mm. Too bad.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.546
But he does listen to prayers.

10:30.629 --> 10:33.549
Well, I sure hope
he's listening to mine.

10:40.723 --> 10:41.932
Hey, sexy.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.559
What's going on?

10:43.642 --> 10:45.561
{\an1}Nothing.

10:45.644 --> 10:48.230
You know what
tomorrow is?

10:48.314 --> 10:49.732
{\an3}Sunday.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.568
Mm. It's Mother's Day.

10:52.651 --> 10:56.238
Ever since my mom died,
it's the worst day of the year.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.240
{\an3}Oh, honey.

10:58.324 --> 11:01.577
I keep thinking that things
will get easier, you know?

11:01.660 --> 11:04.205
{\an1}That time will heal,
but it doesn't.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.040
{\an3}(sighs)

11:06.123 --> 11:08.709
I'll tell you what.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.754
Sunday we'll...
go for a drive,

11:11.837 --> 11:13.714
take your mind off things,
just you and me.

11:13.798 --> 11:14.924
We'll drive up the coast.

11:15.007 --> 11:16.884
A drive?

11:18.344 --> 11:20.763
I'm talking to you...
about death...

11:20.846 --> 11:22.598
I'm talking to you
about death here,

11:22.681 --> 11:25.434
and you think taking a drive
is gonna get rid of that?

11:25.518 --> 11:29.271
You know, I'm trying here,
Clare, I'm really trying.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.981
It's kind of frustrating for me.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.110
Whatever I say or whatever I do,
it's not good enough.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.569
I can't believe

11:35.653 --> 11:36.654
you're making this about you.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.614
Why are you being so selfish?

11:38.697 --> 11:40.116
You're the one who's
making this about me.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.411
I'm trying to love you here,

11:43.494 --> 11:44.787
but all you do

11:44.870 --> 11:45.746
is criticize me.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.289
Honey, I'm sorry you're in pain,

11:47.373 --> 11:50.292
but if you didn't want my help,
why did you come here?

11:50.376 --> 11:52.795
I don't know.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.672
Listen to us.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.674
All we do is fight.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.136
{\an3}When times are good,
times are bad.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.805
It's not good.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.974
We got to work through this.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.810
You know, it's funny...

12:07.893 --> 12:09.437
I come here to tell you

12:09.520 --> 12:12.022
that I'm coming up
on the worst day of the year,

12:12.106 --> 12:13.607
and you decide that it's time

12:13.691 --> 12:15.860
to deal with the cracks
in our relationship.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.655
You know what?
You deal with it, okay?

12:19.738 --> 12:21.490
I don't have
the heart for it today.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.701
Happy Mother's Day.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.162
{\an1}No. I'm not giving you
the last word.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.204
Not today.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.623
{\an3}You might be the smartest
girl I know, Clare,

12:29.707 --> 12:31.459
{\an3}but right now you
don't sound too bright.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.627
{\an3}If we're gonna make
it through this,

12:33.711 --> 12:35.629
you need to lean on me.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.298
Lean.

12:37.381 --> 12:38.924
Don't push.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.969
I'm sorry.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.888
You're right.

12:43.971 --> 12:47.683
Maybe a drive up the coast would
be a nice way to spend Sunday.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.393
Maybe.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.480
But let's not wait till Sunday.

12:52.563 --> 12:55.524
Let's get some fresh air,
get a fresh start.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.027
{\an3}Okay?

12:58.110 --> 13:01.030
Okay.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.243
{\an3}I ordered extra
security for tonight,

13:06.327 --> 13:07.745
just in case.

13:07.828 --> 13:11.081
{\an1}Well, you've got everything
under control, don't you?

13:11.165 --> 13:13.792
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.753
Why? You got

13:15.836 --> 13:17.046
a problem with something?

13:17.129 --> 13:18.714
No, not at all--
I'm just saying

13:18.797 --> 13:20.257
{\an1}that you're doing
a fabulous job.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.092
{\an1}Booking the talent
and working

13:22.176 --> 13:24.220
with the managers
and making deals.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.763
(laughs)

13:25.846 --> 13:27.765
All right, Val,
what do you want?

13:27.848 --> 13:29.225
I hear it coming.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.769
{\an1}Nothing. Can't I
give you a compliment?

13:31.852 --> 13:33.270
Sure. Yeah.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.940
I'm just looking
for the strings, that's all.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.900
David there's no strings.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.277
{\an1}It's just, you're doing
such a good job,

13:40.361 --> 13:42.738
you hardly need me anymore.

13:42.821 --> 13:43.906
What's that supposed to mean?

13:43.989 --> 13:46.909
David, relax, okay?

13:46.992 --> 13:50.037
I'm just saying I'm glad
that you're my partner.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.206
That's all.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.298
Donna, where's Kelly?

14:01.382 --> 14:03.717
SWh-What's going on?m.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.594
Just talk to her, okay?

14:05.678 --> 14:06.929
Kel?

14:07.012 --> 14:08.764
KELLY:
I'll be out in a minute.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.057
What's going on?

14:10.140 --> 14:12.685
{\an3}Brandon, please
talk to her.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.313
{\an3}Kel...

14:18.857 --> 14:20.442
Oh, God.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.778
What's going on?

14:22.861 --> 14:24.446
What do you want me to do?

14:24.530 --> 14:25.781
Nothing.

14:25.864 --> 14:26.949
Um, I'm fine.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.450
Just go meet...

14:28.534 --> 14:29.618
{\an1}David.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.287
I need to talk to Brandon alone.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.580
{\an3}DONNA:
Okay.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.873
{\an3}Um, I'll call
you later.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.751
Are you all right?

14:37.835 --> 14:40.296
That depends
on how you look at it.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.304
I'm pregnant.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.639
What?

14:50.723 --> 14:53.517
I took a home pregnancy test,

14:53.601 --> 14:55.102
and it came out positive.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.104
But you're okay?

14:57.187 --> 14:59.273
Yeah, but did you hear me?

14:59.356 --> 15:00.774
I'm pregnant.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.027
Yeah, yeah, I heard you,
and I understand, but...

15:03.110 --> 15:05.321
{\an1}when I heard your
voice on the phone,

15:05.404 --> 15:07.323
{\an1}I thought that something
was really wrong.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.991
I thought you were
sick or something.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.909
{\an3}Brandon, what
are we gonna do?

15:10.993 --> 15:15.122
Well, we're gonna get you an
appointment with a real doctor.

15:15.205 --> 15:18.792
We're not going to rely
on a drugstore pregnancy test.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.962
And if a real doctor says that
you're really pregnant, then...

15:22.046 --> 15:23.797
we'll deal with it then.

15:23.881 --> 15:25.549
It's gonna be okay.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.802
How can you say that?

15:28.886 --> 15:31.889
{\an1}What'd you
expect me to say?

15:33.057 --> 15:34.475
I-I...

15:34.558 --> 15:37.186
{\an3}called the doctor-- she
can't see me till Monday.

15:37.269 --> 15:38.479
That's all rigNo,

15:38.562 --> 15:40.731
we need to talk
abouKelly...ow.

15:40.814 --> 15:42.399
I love you.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.694
I love you, too.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.237
Then trust me.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.073
There's nothing we can do

15:49.156 --> 15:50.908
until we know what's what.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.326
Okay?

15:52.409 --> 15:53.786
Okay.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.704
Okay.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.851
Well, I'm glad you came by.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.812
Me, too.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.147
{\an1}Here we go-- two
megaburgers, medium.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.774
{\an1}Haven't seen
you around much

16:23.857 --> 16:25.442
late(groans)

16:25.526 --> 16:28.070
I'm just trying to pass
my courses and graduate.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.572
{\an1}I haven't had any time
to breath, let alone eat.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.074
{\an6}DAVID:
Well, you
got to eat.

16:32.157 --> 16:32.950
{\an3}Especially if
you're studying.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.993
{\an1}You're starting to sound
like me, Silver.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.745
Or better yet, my mother. Ha-ha!

16:38.539 --> 16:41.291
So why the sudden
change of heart?

16:41.375 --> 16:43.460
{\an3}I mean, I'm-I'm
glad you came by.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.130
I just thought
you couldn't make it today.

16:46.213 --> 16:49.717
I know I said that, but...
I just needed to see you.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.428
Uh-oh. What'd I do?

16:52.511 --> 16:55.472
Nothing! I just needed
to see you and to kiss you

16:55.556 --> 16:58.100
and to tell you in person
how grateful I am

16:58.183 --> 17:00.102
you've had the patience
to wait for me.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.479
(chuckles):
To wait for what?

17:02.563 --> 17:04.356
You know.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.443
Donna...

17:07.526 --> 17:10.279
I'm not waiting for you,
I'm waiting with you.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.071
There's a big difference.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.366
You really get it, don't you?

17:15.867 --> 17:18.454
Yeah. Yeah,
I think I finally do.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.580
Mm.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.462
{\an3}Your burgers are
getting cold.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.628
Thanks, Nat.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.214
(chuckles)

17:33.552 --> 17:35.929
{\an1}Taking a study break,
Miss Martin?

17:36.013 --> 17:37.973
Hi. Professor Langely,

17:38.057 --> 17:41.143
{\an1}I, uh, I-I didn't know
that you came here.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.436
Teachers do eat.

17:42.519 --> 17:44.646
Nat's been Oh. Yeah,e for years.

17:44.730 --> 17:45.981
{\an1}I meant I-I've
never see...

17:46.064 --> 17:47.983
{\an1}Must I
remind you,t.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.651
your final is in one week,

17:49.735 --> 17:51.987
and your course grade
lies in the balance.

17:52.070 --> 17:53.614
You might want to reconsider

17:53.697 --> 17:55.115
your priorities.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.283
But...

17:56.366 --> 17:57.659
Good luck on the exam.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.246
Or on the romance--
whichever is more important.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.667
{\an3}(exhales):
She's cold.

18:05.751 --> 18:06.960
(exhales)

18:07.044 --> 18:08.337
I got to go.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.671
I can't fail this exam.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.799
Well, I'll-I'll see
you tonight, right?

18:11.882 --> 18:13.592
Yeah. Okay, yeah, I'll try.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.552
Donna... relax.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.845
I can't relax.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.472
Didn't you hear her?

18:18.555 --> 18:20.432
I'll call you later.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.898
(clears throat)

18:30.067 --> 18:31.985
Are you scared?

18:32.069 --> 18:33.987
Sure I am.

18:34.071 --> 18:37.366
{\an1}Jesse and Andrea
made it-- so could we.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.827
Yeah.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.287
But do you want to?

18:43.705 --> 18:45.666
I don't know.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.335
{\an3}Think about it, Brandon,
this is the time in our life

18:48.418 --> 18:49.837
{\an3}when we're supposed
to be having fun.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.713
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.508
{\an1}But maybe it's time
to put something

18:54.591 --> 18:56.760
or... somebody
ahead of that.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.555
Your mother did.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.431
With Erin, you mean?

19:01.515 --> 19:02.808
Yeah.

19:04.101 --> 19:07.521
Well, she had an abortion once,
too, Brandon.

19:07.604 --> 19:09.439
She said it was hard, but...

19:09.523 --> 19:11.567
it was the right choice for her.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.443
Well, what if we
don't make that choice?

19:13.527 --> 19:17.072
I just don't think
it's the right time.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.574
Is there ever a right time?

19:18.657 --> 19:19.950
{\an1}We could survive
a baby, Kelly.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.911
People do it all the time.

19:24.496 --> 19:27.249
What if I decided
to end this pregnancy?

19:29.042 --> 19:31.044
Could we survive that?

19:50.355 --> 19:52.566
It's a wonderful room, huh?

19:52.649 --> 19:54.276
Yeah.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.069
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.156
David, what went wrong with us?

20:00.657 --> 20:02.784
{\an3}(laughs)

20:02.868 --> 20:04.786
{\an3}I don't think
this is exactly

20:04.870 --> 20:07.289
the right time to
explore our past.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.082
I mean, we have

20:09.166 --> 20:11.251
a big night to get ready for.

20:12.544 --> 20:16.965
You know, my mom
used to say that, um...

20:17.049 --> 20:18.967
the past is history,

20:19.051 --> 20:21.470
{\an1}and the future
is a mystery

20:21.553 --> 20:23.430
and the present is a gift.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.309
A gift.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.644
Take it.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.437
Val, don't.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.314
{\an1}What, don't you ever
think about me?

20:32.397 --> 20:33.482
About us?

20:33.565 --> 20:36.443
What's on your mind?

20:36.526 --> 20:39.154
I think you know.

20:39.237 --> 20:41.531
{\an1}David, I think
about you

20:41.615 --> 20:43.784
all the time.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.662
I can't help it.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.246
Come on.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.332
Stop it!

20:50.415 --> 20:53.460
Fine. I just thought
you might want to feel

20:53.543 --> 20:54.920
a woman's skin again.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.880
It's not like you're

Hi, Derek, it's Valerie Malone.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.501
I think David Silver may want
to buy me out after all.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.420
So why don't you come by
the club tonight,

21:36.503 --> 21:38.547
and we can celebrate.

21:49.057 --> 21:49.933

21:50.017 --> 21:51.560
I'm so glad we did this.

21:51.643 --> 21:53.270

{\an3}See, I'm not
a total idiot.

21:54.813 --> 21:55.939
I'm the idiot.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.441
{\an3}Well, now that we've
established that,

21:57.524 --> 21:58.775
{\an3}I've got some more
advice for you.

21:58.859 --> 22:01.111
What?

22:01.194 --> 22:03.238
{\an3}Well, Clare, your dad's
really the only one

22:03.321 --> 22:05.240
{\an3}who can relate to how
much you missed your mom

22:05.323 --> 22:07.117
this time of year, so...

22:07.200 --> 22:08.952
why don't you spend
Mother's Day with him?

22:09.036 --> 22:10.579
No, I can't.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.289
{\an3}Why not?

22:12.372 --> 22:14.916
'Cause he won't
talk about it.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.795
When she died, he put all her
pictures away, and that was it.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.088
Maybe you can
get through to him.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.089
I've tried.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.091
(sighs)

22:23.175 --> 22:24.634

you should just

22:24.718 --> 22:25.927
stick to one good idea a day.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.180
{\an3}No, Clare you've
got to keep trying.

22:28.263 --> 22:29.514
It'll be good
for him, too.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.099
{\an3}He's still not over
your mom at all.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.476
Why does he have to be?

22:32.559 --> 22:34.478
{\an3}Because he needs to
get on with his life.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.104

talking about, Clare.

You know what?

I can't change you,
but I could change me.

22:56.666 --> 22:57.959

with you anymore.

stay together,

29:41.946 --> 29:42.780
Your decision?

29:42.864 --> 29:44.365
Our decision.

29:44.449 --> 29:45.200
No, you were right

29:45.283 --> 29:47.368
the first time;
it is your decision.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.538
Can we just not
talk about this for awhile

29:50.622 --> 29:51.539
and just listen to the music?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.666
This afternoon,
you wanted to talk about it.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.460
You wanted to get everything
settled in ten minutes.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.419
{\an3}Yeah, well,
this isn't

29:56.503 --> 29:57.462
this afternoon anymore, okay?

29:57.545 --> 29:58.671
I'm tired of thinking about it.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.048
I just want to forget
about everything

30:00.131 --> 30:02.008
for a couple of hours,
and then I want to...

30:02.091 --> 30:04.135
crawl into bed and go to sleep.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.639
Whose bed?

30:09.641 --> 30:10.683
Mine.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.355
I understand.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.366
What do you mean
she came on to you?

30:26.449 --> 30:28.409
How?

30:28.493 --> 30:29.994
(sighs softly)

30:30.078 --> 30:32.038
Donna, you really don't want
to hear the details.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.498
Yeah, I do.

30:33.581 --> 30:34.457
I want to know everything.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.127
All right, fine.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.255
(sighs softly)

30:42.840 --> 30:43.758
She kissed me.

30:43.841 --> 30:45.426
{\an3}That what you
wanted to hear?

30:45.510 --> 30:47.011
No.

30:47.095 --> 30:50.390
I want to know,
did you kiss her back?

30:50.473 --> 30:52.600
No.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.977
Donna, that's why
I'm telling you this.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.104
What(chuckles softly)edal?

31:00.024 --> 31:00.900
I thought you should know.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.860
I mean, this is very
uncomfortable for me.

31:02.944 --> 31:07.490
I didn't know what to do, and I
thought maybe you could help me.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.158
But you know what,
I'm sorry for asking.

31:09.242 --> 31:10.159
Never mind.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.160
No.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.287
No, I'm sorry.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.413
Look, I can't tell you
not to sleep with someone else

31:13.496 --> 31:16.165
when I won't give you the option
of sleeping with me.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.001
I don't want to sleep
with anybody but you.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.586
This isn't about sex.

31:19.669 --> 31:20.628
This is about Valerie.

31:20.712 --> 31:23.131
And you know how she works
as well as anybody.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.759
What do I do?

31:26.843 --> 31:29.637
You can't work together anymore.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.390
We don't just work together.

31:32.473 --> 31:35.643
I own this place.
Half of it, anyway.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.769
Then sell.

31:36.853 --> 31:37.937
There's other clubs.

31:38.021 --> 31:39.439
It's not that easy.

31:39.522 --> 31:41.482
(sighs)

31:41.566 --> 31:43.484
I knew this wasn't over.

31:43.568 --> 31:47.572
{\an1}You know, I tried
not to worry about it,

31:47.655 --> 31:50.199
but deep down, I knew that
Valerie wouldn't give up.

31:50.283 --> 31:53.161
It just kills her to see you
with somebody else.

31:53.244 --> 31:57.498
David, she's gonna try again,
and what if next time...

31:58.625 --> 32:01.669
...what if next time,
you're not that strong?

32:01.753 --> 32:03.796
This is very simple.

32:03.880 --> 32:07.675
Our entire relationship is
on the line here.

32:07.759 --> 32:13.640
And if you don't get that,
I just can't explain it to you.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.854
(doorbell rings)

32:21.230 --> 32:22.523
{\an1}Silver, what are you
doing here?

32:22.607 --> 32:23.524
Hey. Is Valerie home?

32:23.608 --> 32:24.525
Yeah, she's upstairs.

32:24.609 --> 32:25.610
{\an1}Thanks.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.659
Val?

32:34.952 --> 32:36.037
Well, hi.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.747
So, does this mean

32:37.830 --> 32:39.707
that you've had
a change of heart?

32:39.791 --> 32:42.377
You amaze me.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.170
{\an1}You have
absolutely no respect

32:44.253 --> 32:46.005
for my relationship with Donna
whatsoever.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.550
I can't take it.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.386
Well, excuse me.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.888
How am I supposed to respect
something that isn't there?

32:53.971 --> 32:55.390
It's ridiculous.

32:55.473 --> 32:56.724
{\an3}What kind
of relationship

32:56.808 --> 32:58.059
is that?

32:58.142 --> 33:00.561
David, I know you.
I've slept with you.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.230
And maybe for a week

33:02.313 --> 33:03.314
I could kind of see the appeal,

33:03.398 --> 33:06.192
but how long are you gonna live
like a monk, huh?

33:06.275 --> 33:07.777
It's really none
of your business.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.073
I'm selling, Val.

33:13.658 --> 33:14.742
Selling?

33:14.826 --> 33:16.369
Just name the price, okay?

33:16.452 --> 33:18.579
I can't work with you anymore.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.623
Has no sex addled your brain?

33:20.707 --> 33:23.209
Or are you just too angry
to admit the truth?

33:23.292 --> 33:24.752
The truth is, David,

33:24.836 --> 33:27.922
that the club means more to you
than it ever did to me.

33:28.005 --> 33:29.048
You love it.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.092
{\an1}You love everything
about it.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.927
The crowds, the music,

33:33.010 --> 33:34.512
late nights.

33:34.595 --> 33:38.015
Maybe that's why you've gone
with no sex for so long.

33:38.099 --> 33:40.435
You get the same charge
every night.

33:40.518 --> 33:44.063
Well, I'll find it
somewhere else.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.941
David, listen to me.

33:47.024 --> 33:49.736
Let me sell the club to you.

33:49.819 --> 33:51.571
The truth is,

33:51.654 --> 33:57.160
it's way too hard
to be around you.

33:57.243 --> 33:58.244
I think about you,

33:58.327 --> 34:02.248
{\an1}way too much
to see you everyday.

34:02.331 --> 34:04.667
Especially you with Donna.

34:04.751 --> 34:07.086
All right, fine.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.755
Fine, draw up the contracts.

34:09.839 --> 34:11.674
You're out of business.

34:11.757 --> 34:14.177
(door opens, shuts)

34:29.067 --> 34:31.860
{\an1}I stopped to see your father
this morning.

34:31.944 --> 34:33.029
{\an3}You did?

34:33.112 --> 34:34.155
Yup, bright and early.

34:34.237 --> 34:36.824
{\an1}You know he likes
poppyseed bagels, too?

34:36.908 --> 34:38.367
Yeah, I know.

34:38.451 --> 34:42.830
Yeah, well, um, we sat
and we had a nice long talk.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.081
Two hours.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.666
(both chuckle)

34:45.750 --> 34:46.542
He showed me some pictures.

34:46.626 --> 34:50.838
{\an1}He thought maybe
you'd like to see them.

34:52.965 --> 34:55.009
{\an3}Oh, my...

34:55.092 --> 34:57.053
{\an1}You were

34:57.136 --> 34:58.513
a very pretty little girl,
Clare.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.473
You think so?

35:00.556 --> 35:03.851
Yeah. Your mom was
absolutely beautiful.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.728
Yeah.

35:05.812 --> 35:08.189
Come on.
There's some great ones in here.

35:08.272 --> 35:09.315
He looked at these?

35:10.274 --> 35:14.153
He hasn't opened that book
since she died.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.530
That's not true.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.198
{\an1}Your dad told me
he looks

35:17.281 --> 35:19.033
at a picture of your mom
every night.

35:19.116 --> 35:20.326
He even talks to her.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.370
He's never told me that.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.205
You never asked him.

35:24.288 --> 35:27.375
{\an4}He thought you
just didn't want
to talk about her.

35:27.458 --> 35:28.709
But he did.

35:28.793 --> 35:32.213
You know I was wrong
about your father, Clare.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.382
He is over your mom.

35:34.465 --> 35:39.220
{\an4}As much as anybody
can be over somebody
they really loved.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.556
It's you, Clare.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.058
You're the one
who's still not over her.

35:44.141 --> 35:48.229
She was my mom, you know.

35:48.312 --> 35:49.730
I miss her.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.232
Well, then look at her.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.192
Talk to her.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.069
If you let her back
into your life,

35:55.152 --> 35:56.153
she'll help you heal.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.824
You ready?

36:12.670 --> 36:14.255
(voice breaking):
I thought she was

36:14.338 --> 36:16.966
the most beautiful
woman in the world.

36:19.468 --> 36:21.345
{\an1}I think you look
just like her.

36:31.063 --> 36:32.231
FELICE:
<i>I do love this restaurant.</i>

36:32.315 --> 36:34.066
What a perfect choice.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.860
{\an1}I hope Kelly
and Erin get here soon.

36:35.943 --> 36:36.903
{\an1}The traffic was
terrible.

36:36.986 --> 36:38.112
Oh, tell me about it.

36:38.195 --> 36:39.822
I was thinking
about walking here.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.157
Oh,

36:41.240 --> 36:43.159
{\an5}there's David.
I didn't know
he was coming.

36:43.242 --> 36:47.246
Well, neither did I. I thought
this was a "ladies only" brunch.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.248
{\an3}Uh, me, too.
Just hang on a second.

36:50.833 --> 36:53.252
Hi, sorry to interrupt.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.921
This will just
take a second.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.464
{\an4}FELICE:
Well, I wonder
what that's all about.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.508
{\an1}Oh, I'm sure
everything's fine.

36:59.592 --> 37:03.429
{\an3}(chuckles) With David,
you can't always be sure.

37:03.512 --> 37:04.847
What's going on?

37:04.931 --> 37:09.769
{\an1}Well, (clears throat)
I was up all night

37:09.852 --> 37:11.187
{\an1}and I came
to a decision.

37:11.270 --> 37:14.815
I told Val
I'm buying her out.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.026
Oh, good!

37:17.109 --> 37:19.320
Well, I guess you like
that idea.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.155
Oh, yes, that is a great idea.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.199
Uh, well, where are you going
to get the money?

37:23.282 --> 37:27.161
Well, first I'll try the bank
and then my dad.

37:27.244 --> 37:28.829
And if all else fails,

37:28.913 --> 37:30.873
I was actually thinking
of asking your mom.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.208
(chuckles)

37:32.291 --> 37:33.084
That doesn't matter.

37:33.167 --> 37:36.337
All I know is how much
you mean to me

37:36.420 --> 37:38.339
and how much
the club means to me.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.216
And I don't plan

37:40.299 --> 37:41.384
on losing either of them.

37:41.467 --> 37:43.302
Good.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.524
{\an3}He really does love
my daughter, doesn't he?

37:56.607 --> 37:59.443
{\an1}That's something
I'm sure of.

38:07.284 --> 38:09.370
{\an3}So I should have
the money very soon.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.038
That's great.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.873
{\an1}Mr. Silver is
a perfect buyer.

38:12.957 --> 38:14.208
{\an1}Let him have
the headaches.

38:14.291 --> 38:15.334
You'll have the cash.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.293
(both laugh)

38:16.377 --> 38:18.379
So, Bill Taylor's that good
with money, huh?

38:18.462 --> 38:19.380
He's better than good.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.715
And he cannot wait to meet you.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.550
When exactly is that gonna be?

38:22.633 --> 38:24.552
{\an1}As soon as he gets back
from Manila.

38:24.635 --> 38:26.679
And until then,
what do I have to do?

38:26.762 --> 38:27.972
It's simple, really.

38:28.055 --> 38:30.850
As soon as you close the deal on
the club, we take the proceeds,

38:30.933 --> 38:31.726
put 'em into an interest-bearing

38:31.809 --> 38:34.061
{\an1}money-market account
until you and Bill can

38:34.145 --> 38:36.397
plan out
a complete investment strategy.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.898
That sounds great.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.525
This is a smart move.

38:39.608 --> 38:41.569
You're going to make
a lot of money.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.571
{\an1}But more important,
you're gonna

38:43.654 --> 38:44.780
feel taken care of

38:44.864 --> 38:46.365
by someone who really knows
what he's doing.

38:46.449 --> 38:48.367
Well, I'm grateful.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.536
I was definitely not meant
to be a club owner.

38:50.619 --> 38:51.537
{\an1}Maybe not.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.414
But you were meant to be rich.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.583
And I'm gonna see to that.

38:55.666 --> 38:59.587
All right, so, uh,
to new beginnings?

38:59.670 --> 39:01.338
And future success.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.805
I'm glad you decided
to stay here tonight.

39:12.183 --> 39:14.769
{\an3}My bed felt
awfully lonely.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.563
{\an3}I just need you
to hold me.

39:22.985 --> 39:26.072
You know, Kel,

39:26.155 --> 39:29.700
whatever you decide,

39:29.784 --> 39:34.622
{\an1}I'll be here to love
and support you.

39:34.705 --> 39:38.584
{\an3}That's what
you keep saying.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.628
{\an3}That's what
everyone's saying,

39:40.711 --> 39:43.631
{\an3}that they'll support me
no matter what.

39:43.714 --> 39:47.426
{\an3}But I don't know
what to do, Brandon.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.054
I don't want to make this
decision alone.

39:51.680 --> 39:55.101
But it's your decision to make.

39:55.184 --> 39:56.811
It's your body.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.646
But it's our baby.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.022
I need to know

40:00.106 --> 40:01.941
how you feel about this,
Brandon.

40:02.024 --> 40:03.150
How you really feel.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.780
Okay.

40:09.782 --> 40:14.662
At 22...

40:14.745 --> 40:20.417
I don't know if I'm ready
to be a father,

40:20.501 --> 40:24.880
but at 42...

40:24.964 --> 40:27.383
I don't want to look back
and realize that we made

40:27.466 --> 40:29.009
the biggest mistake
of our lives.

40:29.093 --> 40:34.723
Neither do I.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.725
But we're so young, you know?

40:38.811 --> 40:40.729
We can have a house full
of children someday.

40:40.813 --> 40:44.525
Yeah.

40:44.608 --> 40:47.278
But one will always be missing.

40:55.119 --> 40:59.290
{\an3}This would be so much easier
if I didn't love you.

41:00.916 --> 41:03.669
You're gonna do it, aren't you?

41:03.752 --> 41:07.965
I don't know how I'm gonna live
with myself.

41:11.051 --> 41:14.263
But I can't have
the baby right now.

41:16.765 --> 41:18.434
I know.
