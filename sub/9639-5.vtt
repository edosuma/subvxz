WEBVTT

00:05.430 --> 00:06.530
Okay.

00:06.670 --> 00:10.730
- Whole wheat, no crust, $5 in a bag.
- Yeah.

00:11.410 --> 00:14.310
You might wanna put a jacket on
because it's very chilly outside.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.640
Fine.
Stop all the racket, l'll wear a jacket

00:18.280 --> 00:20.940
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:22.420 --> 00:23.940
No, not, ''Hey.''

00:24.090 --> 00:25.280
l meant, hey.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.120
And when your mom said
to put on a jacket,

00:27.260 --> 00:29.720
she meant go get one, not pop one on.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.620
What's the big deal? lt's just a jacket.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.230
The big deal is today it's just a jacket.

00:34.360 --> 00:37.800
How long is it gonna be before you're
popping a calculator into your math test?

00:37.930 --> 00:40.730
First it's cheating on math,
then it's cheating on everything.

00:40.870 --> 00:42.600
Then this happens, then that happens.

00:42.740 --> 00:44.040
Then you're in jail.

00:46.040 --> 00:49.770
This happens and that happens?
l just didn't wanna walk upstairs.

00:50.210 --> 00:55.580
Well, walk upstairs, take that jacket off,
then come back down and put it back on.

00:56.550 --> 00:58.110
Anything to keep me out of jail.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.520
Hey, Maxy. What's in the box?

01:01.660 --> 01:03.750
Oh, it's my Mars diorama for school.

01:03.890 --> 01:07.590
Where's the Mars part?
lt's just a bunch of beach sand.

01:07.730 --> 01:11.190
Well, it's a pretty barren planet.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.460
What's ''barren'' mean?

01:15.500 --> 01:16.840
Sandy?

01:18.640 --> 01:19.940
We'll discuss this later.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.600
You need to work harder, young man.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.540
Come on. Let's get your sandbox to school
before a cat finds it.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.780
You see? Now l'm late.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.980
- Can you at least write me a note?
- Sure.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.140
Okay.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.950
Dear principal, Alex is late
because her dad is a meanie

01:35.090 --> 01:37.750
for not letting her use magic
to zap a jacket on.

01:38.430 --> 01:39.660
Okay, l'll run to school.

01:43.730 --> 01:45.760
Hey, there's T.J.

01:47.870 --> 01:49.500
Hey?

01:55.480 --> 02:00.070
Are you a--? Would--? You just--
Wha--? Feel-- Wizard!

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.670 --> 02:59.700
Excuse you.

03:00.410 --> 03:02.310
Hey, guys, that kid's face reminded me.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.500
Wanna get some pizza?

03:04.110 --> 03:06.140
l'll show you a pizza.

03:06.680 --> 03:07.880
What did you say, kid?

03:08.020 --> 03:11.320
l said, l'll show you a pizza.

03:12.050 --> 03:14.390
You're always doing that.
That doesn't even make sense.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.010
l'll show you what doesn't make sense.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.890
Dude, get a new insult book.

03:20.460 --> 03:21.490
l'll show you a new--

03:51.060 --> 03:52.460
Hey. Nice shirt.

03:53.060 --> 03:54.760
- l'll show you a--
- Save it.

03:54.900 --> 04:00.490
So your shirt appeared on your body
as if by magic.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.500
Yeah, l change fast.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.200
You know, l'm a quick-change artist.

04:05.340 --> 04:07.830
l was thinking of doing it
for the talent show.

04:08.410 --> 04:09.470
You're a wizard.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.380
You mean with tools.

04:11.510 --> 04:13.380
Like the ones l used
to build the clothes rack?

04:13.520 --> 04:14.950
Yeah, l'm kind of a wizard.

04:15.080 --> 04:19.850
No, a wizard as in potions
and brooms and spells.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.790
Come on. A wizard?

04:23.690 --> 04:25.890
Okay, l guess l was wrong.
See you around.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.290
Sorry, l'm a klutz.

04:31.130 --> 04:34.160
- l saw that.
- Okay, okay.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.700
l'm a wizard.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.300
Don't tell anybody.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.100
lt's okay. Because guess what?
l'm a wizard too.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.770
You are?

04:41.910 --> 04:44.110
- Prove it.
- Okay.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.340
How many fingers am l holding
behind my back?

04:46.480 --> 04:48.710
- How is this gonna prove anything?
- Just guess.

04:48.850 --> 04:51.750
- Four.
- None. lt's my foot.

04:52.350 --> 04:54.720
Oh, nice. The Feet for Hands spell.

04:54.860 --> 04:57.620
l totally forgot about that one.
Show me how it works.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.230
l can't. My parents are really strict
about magic.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.390
l could get in so much trouble
for just doing that.

05:02.530 --> 05:03.790
Oh, that's lame.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.420
As long as nobody knows l'm a wizard,

05:05.570 --> 05:08.130
my parents let me use magic
whenever l want.

05:08.270 --> 05:10.800
You're so lucky.
l can't even magically switch my jackets

05:10.940 --> 05:13.870
without my dad threatening
to send me to jail.

05:14.010 --> 05:15.940
l don't know how you survive
in this world.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.480
lt's so hard being me.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.350
- Are you hungry?
- Starved.

05:27.490 --> 05:30.320
- l'll show you starved.
- Okay, dude, you've gotta stop doing that.

05:38.770 --> 05:40.230
Mustard or ketchup?

05:40.370 --> 05:42.100
The works.

05:54.350 --> 05:57.510
- Aren't you gonna pay for those?
- Oh, right.

06:01.660 --> 06:04.390
Wow, your life is so much easier
than mine.

06:04.530 --> 06:08.160
l'd have to walk all the way over there,
ask the guy to make me a hot dog.

06:08.300 --> 06:10.160
l would've been exhausted.

06:15.170 --> 06:16.760
Hey.

06:17.370 --> 06:20.360
- l said ''hey.''
- Will you get in here?

06:22.240 --> 06:24.740
Okay. So l met an interesting guy
at school today.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.780
For the last time,
l will make my own friends. Thank you.

06:28.950 --> 06:31.350
You're making it so hard
to be excited about something.

06:31.490 --> 06:32.980
This guy is a wizard like us.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.110
Really? A kid from our school?

06:35.260 --> 06:37.490
Oh, that is so cool. What's his name?
Does he seem nice?

06:37.630 --> 06:38.680
We should have him over.

06:38.830 --> 06:41.300
See, this is how you're gonna ruin it.
Just listen.

06:41.430 --> 06:42.690
lt's T.J. Taylor.

06:42.830 --> 06:45.300
T.J. Taylor's a wizard?

06:45.430 --> 06:48.840
Then that magic act he did
at the school talent show was fake.

06:48.970 --> 06:52.800
l mean real.
Which is what made it fake.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.880
He needs to return that first-place ribbon,
l'm making a call.

06:56.010 --> 06:57.880
Wait, Ju-- Justin.

06:58.010 --> 06:59.340
Forget about the ribbon.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.040
Do you know his parents
let him use magic whenever he wants?

07:02.180 --> 07:03.810
Just think about how our lives would be.

07:03.950 --> 07:07.290
l could read books in the dark.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.260
Magic is a waste with you.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.700
Besides using magic
for what electricity can do,

07:14.830 --> 07:17.460
we need to get Dad to let us use
magic whenever we want.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.230
Don't you already do that?

07:19.370 --> 07:21.340
Yes, but l'm tired
of getting in trouble for it.

07:21.470 --> 07:23.100
So l'm gonna tell Dad about T.J.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.210
Maybe that will get him
to loosen up on the rules.

07:25.340 --> 07:26.570
But l love the rules.

07:26.710 --> 07:30.080
Remember that summer when he said
l could go to bed whenever l wanted?

07:30.210 --> 07:31.980
l was a mess.

07:32.850 --> 07:34.210
Well, rules bore me.

07:34.350 --> 07:36.750
l'm gonna go talk to Dad
when he's his happiest.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.790
After dinner and before pro wrestling,
when he's rubbing his belly. Yeah.

07:48.130 --> 07:51.070
Magic whenever you want.

07:52.230 --> 07:53.900
No.

07:54.770 --> 07:57.200
But, Daddy,
T.J.'s parents let him use magic

07:57.340 --> 07:59.310
all the time to do whatever.
lt's not fair.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.810
Well, T.J. Taylor's parents
aren't your parents.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.930
My house, my rules.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.100
Get your own house,
you can make your own rules.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.180
Fine.

08:08.320 --> 08:12.050
And that's not me giving you permission
to conjure up your own house.

08:14.290 --> 08:16.120
Shoot.

08:16.260 --> 08:21.890
Dad, do most Martians wear tin foil
or catcher's equipment?

08:23.670 --> 08:27.330
And you want me to add
freewheeling magic to this chaos?

08:28.370 --> 08:32.240
Hey, you guys. We're five minutes away
from pro wrestling.

08:32.370 --> 08:34.710
Oh, gosh. l've turned into my mother.

08:36.110 --> 08:37.140
Okay.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.080
Honey, Alex ran
into another wizard at school

08:39.210 --> 08:41.770
and now she's talking all kinds
of nonsense like,

08:41.919 --> 08:45.580
''Oh, l wanna do magic
whenever l feel like.''

08:46.150 --> 08:48.280
l don't talk like that.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.610
There's another wizard family?

08:50.760 --> 08:53.690
Because, you know, l would love
to meet the parents and compare notes.

08:54.430 --> 08:57.730
When you guys come over, l wanna make
sure your parents convince my parents

08:57.870 --> 09:00.560
that everyday magic is okay
rather than the other way around.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.570
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.970
Oh, you don't know our dad.
He'll throw a tantrum.

09:05.110 --> 09:07.570
And you'll know
because it sounds like this:

09:08.780 --> 09:10.140
Alex.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.310
Who cares? All right, okay.

09:12.450 --> 09:14.940
A couple of years ago,
l got into trouble for using magic.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.110
My parents tried to send me off
to military school,

09:17.250 --> 09:20.550
so l put a charm on them so no matter
what l do, they go along with it.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.920
l mean, they're not even like parents,
they're more like my little robots.

09:24.930 --> 09:26.890
You charmed your parents?

09:28.060 --> 09:31.590
You're kind of scaring me a little,
but l'm feeling a lot of respect.

09:31.730 --> 09:33.100
Okay, so it is set.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.200
l will clear my parents' schedule,
and we can come over for dinner tonight.

09:36.340 --> 09:37.600
Great.

09:37.740 --> 09:39.330
There. They're free.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.140
- You didn't even use a spell.
- Oh, right.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.140
See, spells are like training wheels.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.040
When you're really good,
you don't need them.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.750
This is your Mars project?

09:52.890 --> 09:54.010
Yep.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.420
That's not a Martian.
That's you in a Martian mask.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.790
How do you know that's me?
That could be a real Martian,

09:59.930 --> 10:03.730
and l just happened to catch a photo of
him conducting Earth gravity experiments.

10:03.870 --> 10:07.100
On a ride called Trip to Mars.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.500
Yep.

10:10.470 --> 10:13.840
Hey, look what l found
in a plastic bag upstairs.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.000
My old bowling shirt.

10:15.710 --> 10:16.970
l thought you threw this out.

10:17.110 --> 10:20.080
Jerry, when you find something
in a bag with used floss

10:20.220 --> 10:22.980
and empty shampoo bottles,
it was thrown out.

10:24.520 --> 10:27.150
Honey, l want you
to put something nice on for the Taylors.

10:27.290 --> 10:30.660
lt doesn't matter what l wear to tell them
what they're doing wrong with their kid.

10:33.860 --> 10:37.760
Oh, so the freewheeling magic
starts now.

10:37.900 --> 10:42.300
- Look, they popped in.
- That's right. No one had to get the door.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.530
What's more courteous than magic?
Nothing.

10:45.670 --> 10:48.340
l'm Theresa,
and this is my husband Jerry.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.880
- This is my wife, Lori.
- l brought you this noodle kugel.

10:51.010 --> 10:52.040
Oh, thank you.

10:52.180 --> 10:55.340
Two of my favorite things,
noodles and funny words.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.510
Though l'm also a fan
of the chocolate-chip babka.

11:01.460 --> 11:02.750
Hey.

11:02.890 --> 11:04.980
T.J., Justin and l would love
to show you the lair.

11:05.130 --> 11:06.150
- Okay.
- No, l wouldn't.

11:06.290 --> 11:09.700
l'm staying here to watch your plan
blow up and pop. Metaphor.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.130
Well, l'll be the one laughing
like a hyena.

11:12.270 --> 11:14.260
- Simile.
- No. Animal joke.

11:17.540 --> 11:21.370
Oh, no. lt's kind of chilly down there
and you don't have a jacket.

11:21.510 --> 11:24.970
lf only you could zap yourself a jacket.

11:25.110 --> 11:27.450
Don't be silly. He's a wizard.

11:27.580 --> 11:29.680
And l don't want my little boy
to be cold.

11:29.820 --> 11:32.150
l can take care of this, no problem.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.690
Toasty. Wherever l go.

11:39.430 --> 11:42.950
Oh, look, honey. There's a wood-burning
stove in the middle of our loft.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.090
There's nothing strange about that.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.900
Oh, look, it's moving.

11:52.370 --> 11:54.930
Nothing strange.

11:55.110 --> 11:57.140
Not too close to the shelves.
We need those books

11:57.280 --> 11:59.540
so we don't look like
we watch too much TV.

12:08.320 --> 12:11.490
- Here's our lair.
- l'll show you a lair.

12:11.630 --> 12:14.290
You weren't kidding.
He really does do that.

12:15.630 --> 12:17.690
My whole house is filled
with magic stuff.

12:17.830 --> 12:21.360
l mean, there's this one room,
you open the door, it's a black hole.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.940
l know. Cool, right?

12:24.570 --> 12:26.100
Your life is so great.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.970
l just hope your parents convince
my parents

12:28.110 --> 12:31.080
- we can use magic with no rules.
- You don't have to worry about that.

12:35.820 --> 12:37.750
Well, my dad can be pretty stubborn.

12:37.890 --> 12:41.190
Not after he eats the kugel, he won't be.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.150
Well, what does that have to do
with my dad?

12:43.290 --> 12:46.260
Oh, the charm l put on my mom and dad,
it's in the kugel.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.020
lt's what gives it the cinnamony flavor.

12:48.160 --> 12:51.500
So wait. When our parents eat it,
they're gonna be under the spell too?

12:51.970 --> 12:52.990
You're welcome.

12:55.440 --> 12:58.030
This is great. The only thing
that could possibly make this better

12:58.170 --> 12:59.730
is if Justin were here to hate it.

13:02.310 --> 13:06.910
Don't you think it's a little irresponsible
to let T.J. use magic whenever he wants?

13:09.550 --> 13:10.980
Cinnamony.

13:11.820 --> 13:14.910
Yes, it is completely irresponsible.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.790
What? l thought it was okay
for him to use magic.

13:17.930 --> 13:21.590
lt is absolutely okay
for T.J. to use magic.

13:22.700 --> 13:26.720
That is so right. You know,
l like your parenting style, Taylor.

13:26.870 --> 13:27.930
What do you think, honey?

13:28.770 --> 13:32.170
The only thing l like better
than freewheeling magic is this kugel.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.640
What?

13:35.780 --> 13:39.740
- Dad, you hate magic without rules.
- Relax. Have some kugel.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.780
l'm allergic to cinnamon. That's why
l get my own pie at Thanksgiving.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.980
Oh, yeah. The bland pie.

13:48.860 --> 13:50.720
Oh, so l see you enjoyed the kugel.

13:50.860 --> 13:53.490
- Oh, kugel.
- Max.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.090
Alex.

13:56.230 --> 13:58.560
l don't believe it.
Your misguided plan actually worked.

13:58.700 --> 14:01.760
The Taylors convinced Mom and Dad
to let us use magic whenever we want.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.840
And now you can read in the dark
all you want.

14:03.970 --> 14:06.300
l'm happy about that,
but a little bit guilty.

14:06.440 --> 14:09.310
And also suspicious,
and a little bit hungry.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.180
Hey, Mom, l don't know what to wear.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.620
Oh, well. What are you thinking?

14:21.760 --> 14:24.990
Well, l'm thinking instead of trying
a bunch of stuff on and showing you,

14:25.130 --> 14:26.390
it'd just be easier to do this.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.930
- ls that okay?
- lf it's okay with you, it's okay with me.

14:33.570 --> 14:34.900
Just making sure.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.130
- Thank you, kugel.
- l love that kugel.

14:39.570 --> 14:41.240
Okay.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.170
So l like the shoes on this one,
but the shirt's too light,

14:44.310 --> 14:46.210
and the hat's cute on this one.

14:46.350 --> 14:47.910
- Well, l think--
- Oh, that's the one.

14:48.050 --> 14:51.140
- Thank you, Mom.
- You're welcome, sweetie.

14:55.420 --> 14:56.690
A catwalk.

15:05.270 --> 15:07.530
Oh, this is awkward.

15:13.340 --> 15:17.280
Oh, shoot. l'm hungry.
l forgot to eat breakfast.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.100
Comemakeus Pancakeus

15:26.320 --> 15:28.520
l made it. l missed the subway.

15:28.660 --> 15:31.720
Well, why didn't you use magic
to transport yourself here?

15:31.860 --> 15:34.090
Have you used any magic
since the rules were lifted?

15:34.230 --> 15:38.060
- Yes.
- Besides reading in the dark?

15:38.570 --> 15:40.190
Then, no.

15:40.670 --> 15:42.930
l haven't had time.
l overslept so l was late.

15:43.070 --> 15:44.730
That's the perfect time to use it.

15:44.870 --> 15:46.340
You're afraid, aren't you?

15:46.470 --> 15:49.770
- No.
- Prove it. Use magic right now.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.050
That's not magic.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.310
How do you know
l didn't forget my locker combination

15:59.450 --> 16:00.980
and then use magic to remember it?

16:01.120 --> 16:02.990
Because you made up
a locker combination song.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.750
Right to clear it
Come on, let's hear it

16:04.890 --> 16:07.120
Twenty-three
Left eight digits but don't fidget

16:07.260 --> 16:09.530
Thirty-one
Now for the last, don't go too fast

16:09.660 --> 16:11.690
Six, and you're off to class

16:13.230 --> 16:16.830
Miss Weston didn't like my
Aliens on a Rollercoaster project.

16:16.970 --> 16:19.340
She is so obsessed
with this Mars thing.

16:19.470 --> 16:23.140
Well, if she loves Mars so much,
why doesn't she marry it?

16:25.580 --> 16:27.550
Perfect. Justin.

16:27.680 --> 16:31.020
l'm gonna show you how to enjoy
using magic in a way you'll understand.

16:31.150 --> 16:33.020
You're gonna help Max
with his Mars project.

16:33.150 --> 16:34.250
- Transportium--
- Oh, no.

16:34.390 --> 16:36.150
There is no way
l'm going to the surface of--

16:36.290 --> 16:37.310
--nextorbitorium,

16:38.060 --> 16:39.860
Mars.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.000
lt's all sand.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.690
My shoebox looked just like this.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.600
This is dangerous, Alex.

16:50.740 --> 16:51.760
We shouldn't be here.

16:51.910 --> 16:53.500
Hey, get a picture of me by this rock.

16:53.640 --> 16:56.130
Would you stop it?
There are no Martians.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.010
Cool. Hey, look, the Mars Rover.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.380
No, not cool. Don't break it.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.910
This doesn't look right.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.349
lt's back online.

17:13.660 --> 17:15.720
These rocks will be great for my report.

17:15.859 --> 17:17.300
No, no. Max, come on. We're going.

17:17.430 --> 17:19.490
You can't upset
the natural order of things.

17:19.630 --> 17:20.930
What are you talking about?

17:21.069 --> 17:25.270
lf we can't take rocks from Yosemite, l'm
pretty sure we can't take them from Mars.

17:25.910 --> 17:27.170
What is your problem?

17:27.310 --> 17:29.370
l can hardly believe
Mom and Dad would be okay with this.

17:29.510 --> 17:32.210
Of course they're okay with it.
Just like T.J.'s parents are.

17:32.710 --> 17:34.410
That's what charming
your parents means.

17:35.920 --> 17:36.940
Mom and Dad are charmed?

17:38.150 --> 17:39.810
What? How? When? Who?

17:39.950 --> 17:41.650
- Mom and Dad.
- What? How? When?

17:41.790 --> 17:43.280
- At dinner.
- What? How?

17:43.420 --> 17:45.650
- lt was in the kugel. l think you know what.
- What?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.220
- We have to fix this.
- lt's already fixed.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.800
- We can use magic whenever.
- That's what l'm trying to fix.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.560
That's not fixing anything.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.400
Transportium nextorbitorium

18:11.050 --> 18:12.820
Guys?

18:13.790 --> 18:15.590
Guys?

18:15.760 --> 18:17.780
Guys?

18:18.890 --> 18:20.950
They ditched me.

18:21.660 --> 18:24.060
This is just like the mall.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.890
What's that spell again?

18:27.030 --> 18:29.970
Comemakeus Pancakeus

18:31.640 --> 18:34.160
l remembered.

18:37.580 --> 18:39.140
Mom.

18:39.950 --> 18:40.970
You're charmed.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.780
Yes, l am.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.510
Thank you, honey.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.810
- You don't mind?
- Of course she doesn't mind.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.120
l don't mind anything.

18:50.260 --> 18:53.560
Not even that there's a big piece
of space junk in my living room.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.560
ls that the solar-powered toaster
l've always dreamt of?

19:00.540 --> 19:02.770
No, it's the Mars Rover.
And guess what it's not doing.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.240
Roving Mars.

19:04.370 --> 19:05.810
Oh, the Mars Rover.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.970
That would be great for Max's project.

19:10.310 --> 19:11.780
- Max!
- Max!

19:12.350 --> 19:14.540
Oh, my goodness.
We left Max on Mars.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.270
Oh, isn't that nice.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.640
No, you don't understand.
l left Max on Mars.

19:19.790 --> 19:22.450
l should be in big trouble right now,
and Dad should be fixing it.

19:22.590 --> 19:25.080
What's to fix? Max will be fine.

19:25.230 --> 19:28.090
Just use the spell you used
to go to Mars to get him back.

19:28.230 --> 19:30.890
You mean you don't even care
that we left our brother on Mars?

19:31.030 --> 19:33.630
We're just happy
you're all having fun with magic.

19:33.770 --> 19:35.030
lt's not about that.

19:35.170 --> 19:38.610
lt's about you not caring and l'm disrupting
a million-dollar space program.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.140
- Billion dollar.
- Billion dollar?

19:40.270 --> 19:41.760
Billion-dollar space program.

19:41.910 --> 19:43.170
And l'm scared.

19:43.310 --> 19:45.780
- Scared's good.
- No, it's not. lt's dangerous.

19:45.910 --> 19:48.580
- Dangerous is good.
- No, it's not. That's why we have rules.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.950
So we don't do anything
that's scary or dangerous.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.850
Are you saying that you want rules?

19:52.990 --> 19:55.390
Yes, l want rules. More importantly,
l want my parents back.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.050
Snap out of it. You're under a spell.

19:57.190 --> 20:01.180
Oh, isn't that nice.
She put a spell on us.

20:03.560 --> 20:06.060
Okay, you take the rover back to Mars
and get Max.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.630
l'm gonna figure out
how to reverse the spell on Mom and Dad.

20:08.770 --> 20:11.000
To the thinking chamber.

20:11.740 --> 20:13.540
You mean your bedroom?

20:13.980 --> 20:17.410
- Do you want me to help you or not?
- Sorry. To your thinking chamber.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.880
Whatever you did. Okay, go.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.910
Transportium nextorbitorium

20:23.920 --> 20:25.480
You guys like the brownies?

20:26.390 --> 20:28.620
Delicious. ls there any more kugel left?

20:28.760 --> 20:30.090
No.

20:32.060 --> 20:33.490
Oh, it's good to be home.

20:33.630 --> 20:36.720
You were there a long time.
You probably have to go to the bathroom.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.420
No.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.660
Did that in Yosemite too.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.840
Brownies? This is what your thinking
chamber came up with?

20:47.980 --> 20:50.970
lt turns out the cocoa powder
in the brownies reverses the spell.

20:51.110 --> 20:53.670
That's ridiculous.

20:54.250 --> 20:57.180
Why is there red dust
all over my living room?

20:57.320 --> 21:00.480
lt's-- There-- Mars. Who--? Alex.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.060
Maybe it's not that ridiculous.

21:03.190 --> 21:05.280
Not to mention she left me on Mars.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.560
He's right. lt's all my fault.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.860
You are in so much trouble, young lady.

21:12.670 --> 21:13.690
l know.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.000
Here you go.

21:22.140 --> 21:25.370
Alex and Justin were happy
to make you these brownies.

21:25.510 --> 21:28.680
T.J. says eating brownies
is against the law.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.650
That law was overturned yesterday.

21:34.790 --> 21:38.050
lt was in the--
l mean, don't you read the papers?

21:38.190 --> 21:39.720
Yeah.

21:43.230 --> 21:45.290
Delightful.

21:45.830 --> 21:48.100
Delicious.

21:49.300 --> 21:51.740
Where is T.J.?

21:51.870 --> 21:56.310
He's busy riding up the side of the
Empire State Building on a skateboard.

22:00.180 --> 22:02.910
l made it. l made it all the way to the--

22:05.990 --> 22:07.610
Brownies.

22:09.290 --> 22:10.880
You're in trouble, young man.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.630
l'll show you trouble.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.590
That was never funny.
