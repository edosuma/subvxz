01:38.120 --> 01:41.500
Go away!

01:57.800 --> 01:59.020
Good evening.

03:14.250 --> 03:17.250
Thanks for coming,
I'm glad to meet you.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.060
How was the trip?

03:19.060 --> 03:22.500
Last part wasn't good... too much waiting.

03:22.900 --> 03:26.460
You have to forgive me...
the usual precautions.

03:27.260 --> 03:28.860
Who's your partner?

03:28.860 --> 03:33.100
He's Nicola, a friend.
-Welcome, Nicola.

03:34.820 --> 03:39.660
Roberto told me a lot about you.
-What did he tell you?

03:40.380 --> 03:43.100
That you speak a very good Spanish.

03:46.820 --> 03:51.780
Our conditions are 50% now
and the rest after delivery.

03:51.780 --> 03:55.700
It's a lot...
wasn't like this with Felipe.

03:56.420 --> 03:59.180
Felipe is no more... now I'm here.

04:03.290 --> 04:05.660
Tell him we can arrange.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.180
What did your friend say?

04:09.540 --> 04:14.040
Alright... but I don't wanna
wait too much.

04:14.860 --> 04:17.140
You won't have to wait.

04:17.579 --> 04:21.579
The shipment is in Marbella,
in two days will be in Milano.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.780
Genti will explain all the details.

04:25.760 --> 04:26.980
Please, stay...

04:29.820 --> 04:33.140
What flight back are you taking?
-Tomorrow night...

04:33.140 --> 04:36.820
Good... you get to see
this beautiful city then.

04:38.300 --> 04:42.740
I hope this is the beginning
of a good friendship.
-It might be.

04:52.260 --> 04:54.660
C-H-6-3...

04:54.760 --> 04:56.300
0-9...

04:56.820 --> 04:58.780
six times 0...

04:59.300 --> 05:00.780
25...

05:00.880 --> 05:02.300
0-0...

05:02.350 --> 05:06.020
9-7-7-9-8

05:07.180 --> 05:11.420
The transfer will be today, right?
-Immediately, don't worry.

05:11.520 --> 05:15.660
About the cash?
-30,000 mixed bills, as planned.

05:16.700 --> 05:17.760
Honey...

05:18.060 --> 05:19.760
Righ away.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.340
Good morning.
-Morning...

05:53.100 --> 05:54.500
Morning...

06:07.880 --> 06:09.300
Come in!

06:09.300 --> 06:11.300
1,100

06:14.330 --> 06:15.140
Here.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.900
Thanks.
-Bye Azim, say hello to your family.

06:23.430 --> 06:25.820
Come in, don't be shy.

06:27.700 --> 06:31.300
What's your name?
-Ismail.

06:31.740 --> 06:35.020
Here.  -Thanks...
-You're welcome... next one.

06:35.860 --> 06:37.620
You are...
-Jafar.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.820
Jafar... you can go.

06:39.820 --> 06:42.260
Cut it out...

06:44.060 --> 06:46.780
Here.
-Thanks... bye.

06:47.030 --> 06:48.780
Who's next?

06:51.600 --> 06:56.600
BLACK SOULS

07:07.020 --> 07:09.300
What's wrong, Rocco?

07:10.380 --> 07:12.900
Nothing... why?

07:16.740 --> 07:21.740
About the guy from Naples?
-He came begging forgiveness...

07:21.740 --> 07:25.740
Says he's sorry, won't happen again...
same old story.

07:25.740 --> 07:31.540
It's best for him or next time
I'll beat him good.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.420
I'm hungry.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.260
I wanna eat something.

07:41.700 --> 07:44.620
Let's go to Mimmo's.

07:46.660 --> 07:49.860
I say I'm hungry and you wanna
take me to Mimmo's?

07:49.860 --> 07:51.860
Why? Isn't he good anymore?

07:51.860 --> 07:55.020
Have you gone insane?

07:55.600 --> 07:58.100
You want me to stop the car
and leave you here?

07:58.100 --> 07:59.800
Even the threats now!

07:59.800 --> 08:03.220
Take the next right, to Lecco.

08:04.180 --> 08:09.100
What for?
-Come on, turn this fucking car
and let's go to Lecco!

08:09.100 --> 08:10.980
Alright! To Lecco!

08:10.980 --> 08:16.540
I read your mind, Lui...
-If not for you I'd shot myself...

08:45.460 --> 08:49.620
We're over 40 and still
doing this kind of bullshit?

08:49.620 --> 08:52.860
What have you become?
A little prince?

08:53.620 --> 08:58.660
There's gonna be dogs...
-Dogs? You're scared of dogs now...

08:58.660 --> 09:01.780
Where's the jack?
-What for?

09:01.780 --> 09:03.780
You never know...

09:42.110 --> 09:44.240
Come on!  Run!

09:45.780 --> 09:50.740
You took two??
You'll ruin the car!

10:14.400 --> 10:16.500
Are you staying for a while?

10:16.500 --> 10:19.140
We leave for Monaco
as soon as the stuff arrives.

10:19.140 --> 10:23.460
Have a drink.  -Why not...
-Cheers.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.860
Cheers, Pasquale.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.700
Cheers, buddy.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.220
That girl on the couch,
all by herself...

10:49.400 --> 10:52.980
Bring her up,
I wanna talk to her...

10:59.440 --> 11:00.600
Come here!

11:00.600 --> 11:03.540
What you're doing here
all alone?

11:05.300 --> 11:07.020
What's wrong?

11:07.340 --> 11:09.780
Nothing...

11:15.060 --> 11:19.860
Yesterday Peppe came to me,
Carrozza's son.

11:21.980 --> 11:25.380
Said that Barreca
wants to talk to you.

11:26.020 --> 11:31.740
He says we work with anyone else
but treat them like dirt.

11:32.520 --> 11:36.860
What did you tell him?
-What was I supposed to tell?

11:37.500 --> 11:40.140
That I had to talk to you first.

11:40.420 --> 11:43.120
Can't you come up with
an answer by yourself?

11:43.120 --> 11:48.260
Our folks still live up there...
I try to be reasonable...

11:48.360 --> 11:51.740
What the fuck you wanna
reason about?

11:53.460 --> 11:57.540
Let's go have some wine
with the others... come on.

11:57.820 --> 11:59.540
I'm coming...

15:02.640 --> 15:08.420
Is this all family stuff?
-Get the bullets, into that hole.

15:38.680 --> 15:41.300
Is this your grandpa?

15:41.920 --> 15:47.590
Grandpa Bastiano... they killed him
like a dog, on the Ferruzzano road.

15:47.590 --> 15:53.780
This was my uncle Luigi,
he was with him that day... only 12.

16:03.860 --> 16:10.820
You really wanna do this?
-What are you afraid?  You'll see
that piece of shit will change attitude.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.900
Want a shot?

16:23.240 --> 16:26.620
Where did you take it?
From Peppe?

16:26.620 --> 16:29.460
Nevermind where I took it.

16:32.640 --> 16:39.060
Your uncle handles tons of this
and you buy from that sucker?
-Don't worry about that.

16:39.160 --> 16:44.460
My uncle will send me plenty of this.
-You've said it before...

16:54.500 --> 16:57.700
Is it good?
-It is good.

17:04.180 --> 17:06.220
Let's go.

17:50.660 --> 17:54.780
Hide the gun, we'll meet in 10 minutes.
-Alright.

18:43.660 --> 18:47.620
Here you are...
where have you been all night?

18:47.620 --> 18:50.100
I'm leaving for Milano.

18:50.580 --> 18:54.660
Milano?
-Yes, Milano... move over.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.740
Did something happen?

19:10.740 --> 19:16.180
Nothing... uncle Luigi is back
and I'll go see him.

19:17.020 --> 19:21.780
Come with me... you haven't seen
your brother in a long time...

19:21.790 --> 19:24.900
with all he has done for you...

19:25.000 --> 19:27.290
What did he ever do for me?

19:27.300 --> 19:29.740
Nevermind...

19:33.710 --> 19:38.260
You won't tell me what to do, understand?
-Cut it out...

19:39.300 --> 19:41.260
Talk to him, mom.

19:41.260 --> 19:45.700
Take care... and call
when you get there.

20:23.980 --> 20:26.900
She cried all night...

20:26.990 --> 20:30.220
You should have called me earlier.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.420
Tonight she'll be better.

20:50.960 --> 20:55.620
I'm taking away some cheese.
-I'll get it.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.200
-SHEPARD MURDERED-
-Fight Over A Ransom-

24:03.900 --> 24:06.660
You grew up so tall!

24:10.900 --> 24:12.500
And handsome.

24:14.140 --> 24:17.740
How's your father?
Haven't heard from him in 6 months.

24:17.740 --> 24:22.800
Always on the mountains with animals...
doesn't even talk to us anymore.

24:22.800 --> 24:27.020
I think he's going insane.
-How dare you talk like that of your father?

24:27.020 --> 24:32.660
I'm sick of living down there...
I wanna stay here in Milano with you.

24:33.140 --> 24:35.900
Doing what?
-You know it...

24:35.900 --> 24:39.140
I don't want arguments in the family.

24:40.720 --> 24:44.860
I'm grown... it's my life...

24:46.920 --> 24:51.980
Think about it...
-You've just come and already pissing me off...

24:52.080 --> 24:53.660
We'll see.

24:55.220 --> 25:01.340
Gotta fix you up first...
you dress like a goat farmer.

25:09.180 --> 25:14.140
Don't make it too spicy.
-It's alright.

25:15.380 --> 25:18.580
What times the "criminals" are coming?

25:18.620 --> 25:23.820
Don't joke about such things...
you know they love you.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.500
Good job, sweetie.

25:37.340 --> 25:41.940
Now let's put these here...see...

25:42.940 --> 25:45.820
Here they are!
-Go get the door.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.580
<i>Here's my little Sofia...</i>

25:53.100 --> 25:54.580
<i>How are you?</i>

25:55.340 --> 26:01.640
Uncle Rocco!
-You should have come straight to me
instead of going around with this sucker.

26:01.940 --> 26:05.620
How you're doing?  -Fine.
-How was the trip?

26:07.870 --> 26:10.500
How's your father?
-Good.

26:17.740 --> 26:23.940
Leo, how long are you staying in Milano?
-As long as you want me.

26:24.260 --> 26:27.020
Don't worry... he's staying with me.

26:27.020 --> 26:31.700
No worries... in this house
there's room for everyone.
-I know.

26:32.540 --> 26:36.660
Did your father plant the vine?
-Of course he did.

26:36.900 --> 26:39.860
I asked him, not you.

26:42.020 --> 26:48.720
I don't know, I don't like the country.
-Really? And what do you like?

26:48.720 --> 26:52.620
He didn't come to Milano
to be harassed by you.

26:52.620 --> 27:00.060
Could you speak Italian with me?
-Forgive them, Italian is yet
to arrive down there.

27:00.090 --> 27:05.360
Thank God for that.... Garibaldi ended bad
down our parts.

27:05.360 --> 27:10.560
What does a donkey like you know about Garibaldi?
-Cut it out...

27:10.560 --> 27:13.580
So... you don't like the country...

27:14.300 --> 27:20.400
plus you left school...
you gonna have to do something
with your life in the end...

27:20.500 --> 27:24.490
apart from shooting at
some bar's shutter, I mean.

27:29.560 --> 27:33.340
What bar?
-Don't you try to fool me!

27:34.780 --> 27:39.060
Ok... I'll leave you alone...
I'll check on Sofia.

27:41.720 --> 27:45.340
What's this story?
-Come on, tell your uncle.

27:45.340 --> 27:47.240
Don't you speak?

27:47.260 --> 27:52.240
The kid argued with Ferraro,
from the station's bar...

27:52.240 --> 27:56.940
and the next day someone shot
the bar's windows... am I right?

27:59.340 --> 28:01.860
Who told you?
-Don't you mind who told me!

28:01.860 --> 28:04.540
Is your uncle speaking the truth?

28:04.920 --> 28:08.180
That piece of shit said that
we're a bunch of idiots!

28:08.180 --> 28:11.620
And you go around shooting?
Who gave you permission?

28:11.620 --> 28:15.700
So that's what Ferraro
says about us...

28:15.900 --> 28:20.700
You did good instead...
next time shoot him in the legs.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.820
Yea encourage him too...

28:24.140 --> 28:27.740
Be careful what you put
into this kid's head...

28:28.060 --> 28:29.480
he's a trouble maker...

28:29.480 --> 28:33.540
Come on, Rocco...
just eat and cut this out.

28:34.820 --> 28:37.620
I don't like how you two think.

28:38.060 --> 28:40.180
I already told you that.

29:19.990 --> 29:21.020
Hi.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.900
What do they want?

29:47.580 --> 29:50.740
"The worm" wants to see me.

30:49.860 --> 30:54.020
Hi Luciano.  -Evening, Don Nino.
-Come in.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.460
Have a seat.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.620
What happened, Don Nino?

31:08.340 --> 31:11.900
Your son is not behaving good...

31:13.020 --> 31:15.100
What did he do?

31:16.140 --> 31:22.900
He destroyed poor Ferraro's bar...
shot it full of holes.

31:24.990 --> 31:30.100
Leo doesn't do such things...
are you sure it was him?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.980
Am I sure?

31:39.320 --> 31:44.100
You give him a "spanking"
and we'll forget this time.

31:44.100 --> 31:48.180
It was a kid's act...
I understand that.

31:49.100 --> 31:50.180
But...

31:50.940 --> 31:53.780
even from your part...

31:53.780 --> 31:56.460
it takes an effort.

31:56.780 --> 32:03.140
I sent a message to your brothers
but I got no answer... how come?

32:05.480 --> 32:10.620
I don't know about their business.
-You never know a thing, do you?

32:10.660 --> 32:15.340
You're the older brother and
still you don't know anything?

32:15.980 --> 32:18.820
Do what you have to do...

32:19.150 --> 32:23.860
and be quick... do you get it?

32:53.880 --> 32:55.060
Hello.

32:56.220 --> 32:59.340
Hey, Luciano!
My good man!

33:01.140 --> 33:02.420
How are you?

33:05.620 --> 33:07.740
Yes, he's here.

33:09.260 --> 33:11.900
Why?  What happened?

33:25.560 --> 33:30.540
What time does Cosimo leaves?
-Tonight, soon as the truck's here.

33:30.850 --> 33:36.460
We go with him... it's best if
we're all seen at the village.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.060
Sit right.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.740
You made a big mess.

34:25.090 --> 34:27.699
Get off, come on.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.020
Cosimo...

34:48.800 --> 34:52.380
Did you count them?
-320.

34:53.420 --> 34:56.780
Start loading.
-Right away.

34:57.100 --> 35:01.300
How much we're sending to the Talluras?
-15 as usual.

35:01.300 --> 35:05.780
Let's make it 30...
tell them I'll bring it myself.

35:06.340 --> 35:10.740
Alright.
-I wanna leave in 30 minutes.

35:14.540 --> 35:17.380
Go help Cosimo.

35:29.300 --> 35:32.700
Hi Leo.
-Hi Cosimo.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.060
Take that bag.

38:29.020 --> 38:30.660
Good evening.

38:30.660 --> 38:32.660
Come with me.

38:50.740 --> 38:56.100
It's 30 packs...
you'll pay when you can.

38:56.940 --> 38:59.700
I also got you these.

39:00.540 --> 39:03.820
Thank you.
-Don't mention it... we're friends.

39:03.820 --> 39:11.460
All this generosity...
I'd like to know why.

39:11.460 --> 39:14.900
That scum is getting more arrogant...

39:14.900 --> 39:18.500
I want you close to us, Don Beppe.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.300
You know we are on your side.

39:21.400 --> 39:25.020
Come up to the mountain next Sunday...

39:25.020 --> 39:28.780
and bring the families...
we'll have dinner together...

39:28.780 --> 39:33.060
We thank you but
dad is better stay here.

39:33.160 --> 39:39.300
It's dangerous for him to travel...
-Take the Natile road,
there's no cops there...

39:39.300 --> 39:41.780
We'll think about that, Luigi.

39:42.560 --> 39:46.580
Is that Luciano's son?
-Come here, Leo.

39:47.300 --> 39:50.420
I hear he don't like
to be disrespected.

39:50.420 --> 39:54.540
He's staying with you?
-He's staying with me.

39:54.940 --> 39:57.540
Your uncle is a good man.

39:57.540 --> 39:59.540
He's the No. 1.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.460
Go to your room.

40:38.340 --> 40:43.140
Open the door!  <i>-One second...</i>
Open the door, Leo!

40:47.260 --> 40:48.580
Open it!

40:50.740 --> 40:52.700
What do you want?

40:57.060 --> 41:01.300
Tomorrow you're coming with me
to Ferraro's and apologize to him.

41:01.300 --> 41:06.660
Apologize what?  Thank God
your brother's here to get us some respect.

41:28.220 --> 41:30.220
How lovely...

41:32.500 --> 41:34.260
You don't like it?

41:35.000 --> 41:38.020
What do I do with this?

41:39.420 --> 41:42.900
You wear it... for some occasion.

41:46.040 --> 41:48.060
I see... you don't like it.

41:48.060 --> 41:53.020
It's not that I don't like it...
I have no use for it... I'm too old.

41:53.020 --> 41:58.700
Old what?  You never give him satisfaction... you're awful.

41:58.700 --> 42:01.940
Don't mind mom... you brought
beautiful gifts.

42:01.970 --> 42:05.540
How does it look?
It's beautiful.

42:05.540 --> 42:10.840
You're being a suck up...
-I just say what I think...

42:10.840 --> 42:16.020
I was missing this.
-I know you collect them... with my money.

42:16.460 --> 42:20.620
And for me you brought nothing, uncle?

42:20.620 --> 42:25.540
You're right... I'll let you buy
whatever you want tomorrow.

42:25.540 --> 42:26.460
Thanks.

42:30.100 --> 42:34.460
Good aiming, Pinuccio!
-Wanna shoot?

42:34.460 --> 42:37.260
I don't need that...

42:41.220 --> 42:47.720
Rosario!  Have you gone insane?
Put down that thing... don't act like a kid!

42:48.000 --> 42:51.060
You're always nagging...
-Move!

42:55.360 --> 42:57.300
Go fuck yourself!

42:58.340 --> 43:00.200
Nice shot.

43:00.700 --> 43:03.380
One day I'm gonna gut him...

43:32.320 --> 43:35.220
Have some ricotta.
-I'm not hungry.

43:35.220 --> 43:39.060
Stop acting like this...
your brother is doing all he can...

43:39.080 --> 43:42.580
My brother has got only
confusion in his head.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.220
They're here.

45:18.620 --> 45:20.780
I'm coming.

45:56.940 --> 46:03.340
How you doing, Don Peppe?  -Good enough.
I'm glad you came.  -My pleasure.

46:03.340 --> 46:08.740
Antonio!  How's a going?
-All good.

46:08.740 --> 46:09.500
Pasquale!

46:09.600 --> 46:12.340
Just smile and all will be good.

46:12.620 --> 46:15.140
I don't even know him...

46:15.140 --> 46:20.420
Do it for your grandpa...
it's alright, don't worry.

46:21.240 --> 46:23.540
You're beautiful.

46:26.500 --> 46:31.220
What you're doing still here?
Get off... show yourself.

46:32.380 --> 46:33.220
Come on.

46:37.580 --> 46:39.580
Good morning.
-Morning...

46:44.120 --> 46:46.860
Here... this is Lucia.

46:49.180 --> 46:51.180
And there is Leo.

46:56.080 --> 46:59.780
This is Lucia...
maybe you already know her.

47:02.840 --> 47:05.300
Let's go over there.

47:06.460 --> 47:08.620
Leo.
-Lucia.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.600
What's this sham?

47:17.600 --> 47:22.100
Come to say hello... please, Luciano...
-I'm coming...

48:13.400 --> 48:15.160
Excuse me...

48:16.660 --> 48:18.260
Excuse me!

48:19.580 --> 48:24.140
I'd like to make a toast
to the memory of your father, Bastiano.

48:24.140 --> 48:29.380
We grew up together... he was working
in Africo and me in Bruzzano.

48:29.380 --> 48:32.420
Only the river was between us.

48:32.490 --> 48:35.620
We had a troubled life...

48:37.140 --> 48:42.780
but I guarantee we were
the best of friends... cheers!

48:47.780 --> 48:53.100
Also a toast to those two kids
at the end of the table.

48:53.400 --> 48:56.660
To Leo and to Lucia...

48:56.660 --> 49:02.900
if some sympathy would grow
that will be very good to me.

49:02.900 --> 49:08.580
Let's not be hasty...
the kids are still so young...

49:08.580 --> 49:13.140
Luciano... it's me who is old.

49:13.140 --> 49:17.140
What you're saying?
You gonna live till 100.

49:24.180 --> 49:28.980
Luciano... you always want the last word...

49:36.500 --> 49:41.660
I'll make a toast now...
to fight off the bad thoughts... cheers!

49:51.200 --> 49:53.780
Why don't you loosen up?
-I can't.

49:53.780 --> 49:55.180
Why?

49:57.000 --> 49:59.940
Cause the old man is telling
too much bullshit.

50:00.820 --> 50:02.860
Just let him talk.

50:04.500 --> 50:09.200
I been told the Macrìs are
selling their land.

50:09.200 --> 50:14.100
Let's buy it... you can use it
for the animals and the vine...

50:14.100 --> 50:16.860
and that way we'll own
half the mountain.

50:17.860 --> 50:20.500
What would I do with half a mountain?

50:27.380 --> 50:32.020
So you no longer need me, Luciano?

50:36.580 --> 50:39.100
Wine has finished.

50:54.100 --> 50:59.860
You're pissing me off!
-Get me those bottles.

51:07.980 --> 51:16.040
Dad never trusted the old Tallura
and you brought him into my house...

51:16.060 --> 51:20.220
You think Barreca will get scared
this way?

51:20.220 --> 51:24.740
How come you're all shaking
in front of this rat?

51:24.740 --> 51:29.060
He is done...
-Who do you think you are? God?

51:29.060 --> 51:36.660
Give him what he wants but
don't endanger us all.

51:37.140 --> 51:41.100
I won't give anything to
the man who killed our father.

51:42.490 --> 51:45.220
Then go shoot him.

52:32.580 --> 52:36.540
I wanna talk to Galluzzo tomorrow...
bring him to the house.

52:36.540 --> 52:39.060
Are you serious?

52:42.990 --> 52:45.460
Do as I tell you.

52:53.920 --> 52:56.060
I'm going now.

53:45.100 --> 53:47.780
Don't you recognize me?

53:47.780 --> 53:51.220
Of course I do... compare Mico.

53:51.220 --> 53:55.380
I'm glad you came.
-I appreciate that.

53:57.340 --> 54:02.260
Pardon me but I need a favor...
-Tell me.

54:02.360 --> 54:06.420
Mottura is bothering me...

54:06.780 --> 54:10.100
He leaves his truck under my window...

54:10.460 --> 54:12.940
and all the smoke gets into the house.

54:15.100 --> 54:18.900
If you could help me...
-Don't worry...

54:18.900 --> 54:23.020
I'll talk to him.
-Thank you very much.

56:30.680 --> 56:34.660
Go to the murderers
not to us victims!

56:34.660 --> 56:38.780
You know who those bastards are!
Go get them!

56:39.300 --> 56:42.420
Why don't you say the names then?

56:48.900 --> 56:52.660
And you, ma'am...
have nothing to say?

57:58.990 --> 58:02.140
Rocco, the marshal wants to talk to you.
-Which one?

58:02.140 --> 58:05.300
That puppet from Florence.
-He mustn't bother me.

58:05.300 --> 58:11.620
He wanna call the DA of Reggio...
-Let him call whoever he wants.

58:16.280 --> 58:19.100
They shot him in the face.

58:22.700 --> 58:24.860
You stay calm.

58:26.180 --> 58:28.500
Keep your back straight.

58:28.820 --> 58:30.500
Understand?

59:36.240 --> 59:39.500
What have they done to you, Luigi...

59:49.580 --> 59:52.300
Where did it happen?

59:53.100 --> 59:55.820
The alley behind the church.

59:57.290 --> 59:59.380
They gonna pay.

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:03.740
They gonna pay for this, I swear!

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:06.340
<i>Out!</i>

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:19.100
Let him go!
Stop it, Leo!

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:23.980
They came to mock us!
-Let me handle this!

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:25.460
I said calm down!

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:37.660
Good evening.
-Good evening... these are from Nino Barreca.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.500
You can leave 'em here.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:49.020
Do you have some message for him?

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.620
Tell him thank you.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.380
Goodbye.

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.260
Did you leave him alone?

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:22.220
No, mom... he's not alone...
Rosario is there with him.

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:51.740
What can I do, uncle?
-Nothing.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:56.980
Go upstairs now...
we'll talk tomorrow.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.220
Since when you're so religious?

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.380
Let's bury him...

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.740
and live this grief.

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.180
And then what?

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:46.220
Are we shaking his hands?
Saying "thank you very much"?

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:01.020
Did the Talluras come?
-Yes, at the hospital.

01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:04.620
Tomorrow I wanna talk to them...
bring 'em here.

01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:08.900
The mayor?
-That piece of shit didn't show up...

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:13.700
We've put that asshole where he is
and now he doesn't even show up.

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:15.980
The cops?

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:20.260
The prefect wants the funeral to be
in the cemetery chapel... for safety reasons.

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:23.980
Fuck the prefect!
We'll do it in church...

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:27.900
in the village center...
in front of everybody.

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:31.380
We'll count everyone...

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:35.260
who's there... and who's not.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.060
I know what you're thinking.

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:05.220
He was my brother, you know?

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.820
Now we have to stand united...

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:15.060
without doing stupid things, Leo.

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.820
My blood...

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:20.180
About that debt... be a little patient
and soon we'll pay you.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:25.100
Attilio... do you think
it's the right time to talk about that?

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.580
You're right... I'm sorry...

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:36.100
You remember my father?
-Condolences... I'm so sorry...

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:42.420
You're Stetirò, right?
I'm glad you came.

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.620
Hi, Leo.

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:54.060
I'm sorry...

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.819
Why haven't you come earlier?
-Didn't wanna disturb...

01:08:57.819 --> 01:09:00.740
Now stay here and don't leave.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:11.420
They're coming... shall I bring 'em here?
-Take 'em downstairs.

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:54.140
Not you.

01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:59.780
I thank you for being here.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:05.420
It's time for us to end it
with that snake.

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.940
We want Barreca.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.500
Are you serious?

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:23.080
Do I look like I'm joking?

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.420
You know what this means?
-Means war...

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:32.180
No war... we get rid of Ciccio "The Turk"
and then Barreca... and it's over.

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:38.660
What makes you so confident?
-Trust him... Nicola knows 'em all,
they're all puppets.

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.940
What do you say, Antonio?

01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:50.720
What can I say...
we don't know who killed him...
are we sure it was him?

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:56.860
What you mean sure?
-Antonio... I don't like this kind of talk...

01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:02.820
It's not only us... think of your nephew...
how bad he ended...

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:07.500
We don't know about that...
-What you mean?  That we're
talking bullshit?

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:09.980
Let's stay calm.

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.940
Let's give 'em some time.

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:21.180
Luciano is right...

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:28.260
Let us talk with our father and
in 2 days we'll give you an answer.

01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.140
Cosimo...

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.940
show them out.

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:52.500
Pieces of shit... Luigi made 'em rich
and they just flee...

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:56.540
Let's wait and see...
-They're backing off!

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:58.140
Don't you see?

01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:05.060
Nicola is right... we gotta do it ourselves...
without asking any permission.

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.140
Who told you to come down here?

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.700
You have no saying about this...

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:26.620
Shall we bow our head to this shit?  Rocco!
-I'm thinking, alright?

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:32.620
Think about what? Falling one
by one like pins?

01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:36.140
They've taken Luigi...

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.060
Now it's over...

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:43.940
Why are you talking like that?
He was your brother.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:46.400
Get out.
-Why?

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.820
Luciano... let him...
-You stay out of this!

01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:51.940
I told you they need you upstairs.

01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:56.140
I'm staying here... you go upstairs.

01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:01.700
You don't talk to me like that!
Do you get it?

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.900
End of the show...
-You wanna beat me?  Come on...

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:17.700
Go get some fresh air!

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:22.220
Get him out of here!
-I'll talk to him.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.420
What were you thinking about?

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:34.100
Let me kill that piece of shit...
-Shut up!

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:38.460
Rocco... he's good with the gun...
-I don't care!

01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.860
Whatever...

01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:46.540
We're going to wait...
end of discussion.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.540
Got it?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.660
They wanna kill Barreca.

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:19.540
Luigi should have killed him when
he was powerful... now Barreca has got
the power... let's wait.

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.060
You mean we're backing off?

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:24.060
Let's wait and see.

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:29.940
Antonio is right...
Rocco is good with business
and Nicola is quite capable...

01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:38.460
but war is a whole different thing...
and Luciano is a goat farmer.
-It's over for them.

01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:48.460
Why aren't you speaking?

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.660
You tell me if you're a friend.

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:58.340
What you mean?
-Do you know the abandoned school?

01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:00.100
What about it?

01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:03.660
Barreca's house is right in front.

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:09.500
That's where we gonna get the bastard...
we'll shoot him through the window.

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:12.380
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.390
What are you shitting your pants?

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.940
I knew I couldn't trust you.

01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.940
Cut it out, Leo...

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:38.220
But you want that stuff, don't you?

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:44.180
Don't worry... you'll just have
to watch my back.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.060
Hi, dad.

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.740
Sit down to eat.

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:03.740
I'm coming.

01:16:25.620 --> 01:16:27.500
Everything OK?

01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:59.700
You came.

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:06.060
Come... I'll let you inside.

01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:25.780
I should scold you... last time
you came it was Christmas.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.380
You're right... but you
live so far away...

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.020
Far Away?

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:34.420
The truth is you turned away
from us.

01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:36.420
Come in.

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:50.580
Sheets are clean...
here's the towels...

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:53.780
in case you wanna freshen up.

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:58.220
I'll get you a stove...
-Antonia...

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:01.700
Tell me, dear.
-Won't you tell me what's happening?

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.060
Don't you talk with your husband?

01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:15.580
If you need me I'll be
in the living room with mom.

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:21.540
Change your clothes and come down...
she's waiting for you.

01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:16.500
Mom...

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:21.060
Valeria...

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.260
Hi...

01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:24.660
Hi.

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:30.860
When did you get here?
-Why don't you answer the phone?

01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:33.780
What about the kid?

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.780
She's with my sister.

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.540
What did you tell her?

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.900
That her uncle is sick.

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:55.500
I don't like her to be alone.

01:20:55.500 --> 01:21:00.580
I'm going back to Milano
right after the funeral... and you as well.

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:03.540
I can't come...
-Why?

01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:07.600
I got things to arrange...
-Arrange what?

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.540
Valeria, please...
stay out of this.

01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.340
Try to stay calm...

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:31.340
Your brother has just been killed,
nobody tells me anything and 
I should stay calm?

01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:33.340
Yes, calm...

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:36.980
Go downstairs with my sisters...

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:44.740
I'm not going back there...
listening to half phrases, litanies...
I'm different from you all!

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:47.460
Then what are you like?

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:38.060
That's gotta be the living room...

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:40.900
There's the toilet...

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:46.700
I might get him
while he's shitting.

01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:13.660
What.
-Nothing...

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:25.100
I'll blow that pig's head off.

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:05.340
Pè!

01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:14.500
Where are you going?
-Outside to pee.

01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:29.660
Pè?

01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:45.740
Oh, Pè!

01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.780
Where's Leo?

01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:57.660
Don't know... why?

01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.060
He didn't sleep in his bed.

01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:07.500
He'll come directly to the Mass,
you'll see.

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:27.660
They sent only the women.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:30.260
They're too scared.

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.740
What shall we do?

01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:42.100
Tell the priest to get started.

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.820
Luciano... let's go inside.

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:09.900
"My sin is always in front of me...
only against you I sinned..."

01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:17.740
"What's evil to your eyes, I did it...
your sentence is right, your will is good..."

01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:23.540
"I was born in fault...
conceived in sin..."

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:31.580
Brothers... out life in this village
is not life anymore...

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:34.140
It's a dead men life.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.900
We dedicate these words
to our brother Luigi...

01:28:38.300 --> 01:28:40.820
but mostly to who's still here...

01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:47.820
We gotta offer our heart to the ones
living in the darkness of evil...

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:51.100
with no peace in their hearts.

01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:53.100
Now stand.

01:28:55.980 --> 01:29:01.140
The Lord be with you...
from the Gospel according to Mark...

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:06.140
"Having Jesus crossed
to the other side of the river..."

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:11.220
"A big crowd gathered while
he was on the sea shore..."

01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:15.180
"One of the synagogue heads came, Jairo..."

01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:19.940
"He threw himself at his feet
and started begging..."

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:26.420
"My daughter is dying,
come and save her."

01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:31.260
"He went, while the crowd
followed him..."

01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:37.420
"A woman who was long bleeding
and had suffered so much..."

01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:44.740
"And whom no doctor could heal,
came through the crowd..."

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:47.580
"And touched his cape from behind..."

01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:52.940
"Forgive us Lord for we have sinned...."

01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:45.420
You don't respect anything...

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:49.140
You should be ashamed...

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:57.260
You want something to drink maybe?
Amaro, limoncino, grappa...

01:31:57.700 --> 01:31:59.260
Cut it out.

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:35.740
<i>It's been a tragedy for everyone...</i>

01:36:40.420 --> 01:36:41.780
Luciano!

01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:45.300
Rocco!

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:17.260
Put down that gun.

01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:10.580
