WEBVTT

00:07.560 --> 00:13.080
In the name of Sevis Lwa, I command the spirit Bondye.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.720
Speak to me!

00:17.480 --> 00:20.560
There's truth in the bones!

00:21.760 --> 00:22.840
Evil

00:23.880 --> 00:25.600
is coming.

00:25.640 --> 00:29.120
A scarred man.

00:29.160 --> 00:32.560
Look, he's a killer.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.680
He's killed before.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.160
He will silence me.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.840
Assassin!

00:47.360 --> 00:49.920
I am to be murdered.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.200
I am to be murdered. Murdered.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.600
CAMILLE: I understand.

01:17.640 --> 01:19.680
Okay, no one is to touch anything.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.360
I want the room locked until we get there.

01:21.400 --> 01:22.960
Have we got any ice cubes?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.640
-To go in front of the fans.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.840
Basically, they're just pushing

01:24.680 --> 01:26.840
warm air around.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.200
Coming.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.040
-We should go. -Oh, yep.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.800
Good, good.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.000
What's going on?

01:36.040 --> 01:38.120
A body has been found.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.200
-Notre Dame School.

01:50.480 --> 01:53.240
The school's closed, but I've left

01:50.480 --> 01:53.240
a message for the Headmaster.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.800
-I don't know.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.800
He must have gone out.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.280
Signs of rictus.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.560
Blood around the lips.

02:04.440 --> 02:06.200
She's been poisoned.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.000
WOMAN:<i> I am to be murdered.</i>

02:10.400 --> 02:12.960
I am to be murdered.

02:50.760 --> 02:54.120
Ah, Dr Hudson. My old school science teacher.

02:54.160 --> 02:56.520
The years have improved him, if anything.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.160
So what was she drinking?

02:58.200 --> 02:59.720
Rum.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.760
So what's an old lady doing drinking rum

02:59.760 --> 03:02.760
in a school classroom?

03:02.800 --> 03:05.640
Who was she drinking with, and where's the bottle?

03:05.680 --> 03:08.320
Well, sir, if Mr Dunham hasn't changed,

03:05.680 --> 03:08.320
there might be one here.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.800
-The school headmaster.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.040
And he used to take a quick shot while we were

03:10.840 --> 03:13.040
writing up notes.

03:13.080 --> 03:16.200
He thought we didn't see him. Here it is.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.280
-Yes, sir.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.760
And if you want to commit the perfect murder,

03:19.800 --> 03:21.920
you can't do better than a school science lab.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.720
The poison's in that cupboard there.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.400
And reference books and equipment here

03:23.760 --> 03:26.400
for mixing up recipes.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.480
So that's how you spend your time

03:26.440 --> 03:28.480
in school, is it, Fidel?

03:28.520 --> 03:30.680
Planning the perfect murder?

03:31.440 --> 03:33.120
Quite right, too.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.600
So, what happened here?

03:35.640 --> 03:37.280
She was murdered.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.840
You can have a point for stating the blindingly

03:37.320 --> 03:39.840
obvious, Dwayne,

03:39.880 --> 03:41.400
but I think in order to bring someone to justice,

03:41.440 --> 03:42.600
we may need a little more.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.240
She was murdered by a scarred man,

03:45.280 --> 03:48.320
who's killed before and wanted to silence her.

03:52.040 --> 03:53.240
Voodoo?

03:53.280 --> 03:54.760
She said it, Chief, I swear.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.040
And this was last night?

03:56.080 --> 03:57.280
After you'd been drinking?

03:57.320 --> 03:59.040
I wasn't the only one there.

03:59.080 --> 04:01.880
She said she'd be murdered, and that she saw

03:59.080 --> 04:01.880
it in the bones.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.520
Well, that'll be a first. A victim that actually

04:01.920 --> 04:05.520
predicted her own murder.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.600
Well, you know, there's more to

04:05.560 --> 04:08.600
life than life.

04:10.680 --> 04:12.640
That doesn't even mean anything.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.280
-Just what I told you.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.440
That she'd be killed by a scarred man?

04:17.480 --> 04:19.520
MAN: Would someone tell me what's going on?

04:19.560 --> 04:22.320
I'm Nicholas Dunham, the headmaster here.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.200
Good morning, Fidel.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.920
Good morning, sir.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.440
Angelique Morel.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.880
She was...is my mother-in-law.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.440
I'm widowed now but...

04:42.480 --> 04:43.920
Do we know how she died?

04:43.960 --> 04:45.800
-Well, we're really just beginning...

04:43.960 --> 04:45.800
-She's been poisoned.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.280
What?

04:47.320 --> 04:48.520
Is this your rum?

04:48.560 --> 04:50.720
It's usually in my desk drawer.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.800
Did you drink any of it with Angelique this morning?

04:52.840 --> 04:54.400
Don't be absurd.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.840
Well, it seems she was drinking

04:54.440 --> 04:56.840
with someone.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.920
Well, she came to see me earlier.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.680
We talked briefly and then I left.

05:00.720 --> 05:03.520
And when I did, that bottle was most definitely

05:00.720 --> 05:03.520
still in my desk.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.840
No, sorry, sir. Not you, sir, but that sir,

05:09.800 --> 05:13.200
This glass, I can smell almonds.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.960
Do you keep cyanide in your poisons cupboard?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.040
Yes.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.840
But all dangerous chemicals and poisons

05:19.880 --> 05:23.160
are kept under lock and key, here,

05:19.880 --> 05:23.160
away from the children.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.560
RICHARD: How many keys are there?

05:23.200 --> 05:25.560
NICHOLAS: Just the one.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.600
Mine. So, um...

05:28.080 --> 05:29.760
as you'll see,

05:29.800 --> 05:33.280
all the chemicals are here.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.200
And yes, here's the cyanide.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.680
Don't touch, if you don't mind.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.680
Dwayne, bag this bottle of cyanide,

05:38.720 --> 05:40.680
will you?

05:40.720 --> 05:42.400
Sir.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.520
There's no way that Angelique could've been poisoned

05:42.440 --> 05:44.520
with that cyanide.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.240
Well, let's find out, shall we?

05:46.280 --> 05:49.760
After all, this is a school science lab,

05:46.280 --> 05:49.760
you're a scientist.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.800
I'm sure you've heard of the Prussian blue Test.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.480
Of course.

05:55.520 --> 05:59.480
Then perhaps you can find me the necessary chemicals.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.720
Prussian blue is a colour discovered in the 18th century

06:02.760 --> 06:04.680
and you only get it when you mix three...

06:04.720 --> 06:06.240
So who else has been in the school today?

06:06.280 --> 06:08.600
Uh, Molly Kerr, my secretary.

06:08.640 --> 06:13.320
Tom Hilton, the school handyman,

06:08.640 --> 06:13.320
and Father Charles Dean.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.600
We first add iron sulphate...

06:15.640 --> 06:18.680
-Father Charles.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.720
-We need to talk to them all. -Of course.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.400
Because if there's any cyanide present...

06:23.440 --> 06:24.560
Mmm-hmm.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.760
...once we add the nitric acid,

06:29.120 --> 06:30.880
the liquid will turn...

06:36.000 --> 06:37.160
Prussian blue.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.320
There was cyanide in this glass,

06:39.320 --> 06:41.320
Headmaster.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.000
Any idea how that might have happened?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.920
Angelique just wanted to borrow some books from me.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.040
Something to do with herbal remedies.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.880
CAMILLE: Did you know she practised voodoo?

06:52.920 --> 06:55.200
Yes, well, we rarely discussed it,

06:55.240 --> 06:57.480
this is a Roman Catholic school,

06:55.240 --> 06:57.480
after all.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.360
CAMILLE: How long did you talk to her for?

06:59.400 --> 07:02.000
Ten minutes, no longer.

07:02.040 --> 07:05.080
Then I left her to it and went off to

07:02.040 --> 07:05.080
run some errands.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.640
You left her alone in your classroom?

07:06.680 --> 07:09.320
Well, I didn't know she was about to be murdered, did I?

07:09.360 --> 07:11.160
And these errands, what were they?

07:11.880 --> 07:13.440
Well...

07:13.480 --> 07:16.200
I went to buy some fruit from the market.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.720
-Well, I'd just arrived there

07:18.760 --> 07:20.800
when I got Molly's message to come back.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.120
-Yes, Headmaster.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.720
-Oh, Molly Kerr. -Sorry...

07:25.760 --> 07:28.600
I've been the Headmaster's secretary

07:25.760 --> 07:28.600
for 20 years.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.000
Did you see Angelique at all today,

07:28.640 --> 07:31.000
Miss Kerr?

07:31.040 --> 07:32.240
Oh, yes, I let her in.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.000
<i>I took her straight</i> <i>to the Headmaster's classroom,</i>

07:37.040 --> 07:38.720
<i>just as she requested.</i>

07:42.840 --> 07:44.600
<i>Then I went</i> <i>back to the office.</i>

07:44.640 --> 07:46.240
Which is where I was 20 minutes later

07:46.280 --> 07:49.320
when Father Charles came to tell me

07:46.280 --> 07:49.320
he found her body.

07:49.360 --> 07:53.160
So that's when I rang for an ambulance

07:49.360 --> 07:53.160
and called the police.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.760
I hope I did the right thing.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.120
No, it's a very thorough account.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.160
Thank you.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.440
So Angelique arrived just after 10:30.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.240
The Headmaster said he'd left her by 10:45

08:08.280 --> 08:10.000
and she was found dead by 11:00.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.880
It has to be the Headmaster.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.120
-He's got a scar. -Oh, don't do this.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.120
-But the prophecy... -All right, that's enough.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.920
No one's to mention this prophecy again,

08:16.160 --> 08:17.920
do you hear me?

08:17.960 --> 08:19.360
We're detectives.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.640
We deal in physical evidence and forensic science.

08:21.680 --> 08:25.560
We do not stick pins into dolls and dance naked

08:21.680 --> 08:25.560
around a campfire.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.000
-Now, that I'd like to see. -Yeah, well,

08:25.600 --> 08:28.000
it's not going to happen.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.240
-But it came true. -No, it didn't!

08:31.440 --> 08:33.200
The reason Angelique Morel is dead

08:33.240 --> 08:35.120
will contain means, motive and opportunity,

08:35.160 --> 08:36.720
will have a killer who wanted her dead

08:36.760 --> 08:38.960
and it will contain scientific fact and evidence

08:39.000 --> 08:40.240
that will conform to known precedence.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.000
It will not, I repeat,

08:42.040 --> 08:44.800
not have anything to do with spirits or crystal balls.

08:44.840 --> 08:46.520
Is that perfectly understood?

08:46.560 --> 08:50.400
Nobody, and I mean nobody, is to mention that word again.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.960
-Voodoo.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.080
Oh.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.280
You can't come here and dismiss a whole religion.

08:56.320 --> 08:59.440
Creole beliefs have been part of the island for

08:56.320 --> 08:59.440
hundreds of years.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.720
So were cholera and TB. And the French.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.520
But you managed to get rid of them in the end.

09:03.560 --> 09:07.040
-I'm half-French. -There's no such

09:03.560 --> 09:07.040
thing as half-French.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.720
I want full statements detailing

09:07.080 --> 09:09.720
where everybody was

09:09.760 --> 09:12.160
between 10:30 and 11:30 this morning.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.160
And the Headmaster told us he went to the market,

09:14.200 --> 09:16.480
so find out if anybody saw him there.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.080
What about Father Charles? He found the body.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.720
No.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.880
First, I want to see what kind of woman

09:20.760 --> 09:23.880
predicts her own murder.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.800
That's not strictly correct procedure.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.400
Never had you down as a stickler, Camille.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.080
Definitely the Headmaster.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.160
-Hell yes. -Hmm.

09:57.760 --> 10:02.080
The Headmaster has a link to the victim, he has access to

09:57.760 --> 10:02.080
the poison cupboard,

10:02.120 --> 10:05.040
it was his room and he seems to be the only one with

10:02.120 --> 10:05.040
the opportunity.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.000
Exactly. It's too easy.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.000
Oh! Oh, that's what this is about,

10:07.040 --> 10:10.000
isn't it?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.280
You don't like things to be easy,

10:10.040 --> 10:12.280
do you?

10:12.320 --> 10:15.400
You want them to be difficult so we can all see

10:12.320 --> 10:15.400
how brilliant you are.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.160
I'm sorry, but when even

10:15.440 --> 10:17.160
the murder victim

10:17.200 --> 10:19.080
gives me a description of the killer,

10:19.120 --> 10:22.360
and all the evidence also points at him, I feel like I'm

10:19.120 --> 10:22.360
being manipulated.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.040
So, you ignore the truth?

10:24.080 --> 10:25.440
I don't know what the truth is yet.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.080
Nicholas Dunham is a killer.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.120
You can't possibly know that.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.960
-Intuition. -Oh, great.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.760
Why don't we just go the whole hog,

10:33.000 --> 10:34.760
you know?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.600
I'll take my clothes off, you light the fire.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.560
He's English. -Good grief.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.000
-Yeah.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.200
Is that a lizard? Don't get any ideas.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.560
Was that your stomach?

11:28.320 --> 11:31.800
RICHARD:  Hmm.

11:31.840 --> 11:35.280
Why would Angelique go to the school

11:31.840 --> 11:35.280
for a book on herbal remedies

11:35.320 --> 11:37.600
when she's got her own library?

11:40.880 --> 11:43.760
This must be Angelique's daughter,

11:40.880 --> 11:43.760
Delilah.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.600
Nicholas's dead wife.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.000
These are pretty hardcore.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.160
CAMILLE: It's so sad.

12:00.280 --> 12:01.280
Camille?

12:08.840 --> 12:11.800
She hated Nicholas Dunham enough

12:08.840 --> 12:11.800
to burn his photograph.

12:11.840 --> 12:14.320
-Exactly.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.840
-Then we need to talk to him again.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.840
-Nope.

12:16.880 --> 12:18.720
Now we talk to Father Charles.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.360
He found the body, Camille. It's correct procedure.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.240
You'll appreciate that.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.040
FIDEL: I'll come with you.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.720
DWAYNE: No, you stay here and process the evidence.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.160
And make a start lifting the fingerprints.

12:35.200 --> 12:39.680
I'll go down to the market and see if anyone remembers

12:35.200 --> 12:39.680
seeing the Headmaster.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.880
Then I suppose I better get after Tom Hilton.

12:41.920 --> 12:45.240
Why do I always have to stay here while you run

12:41.920 --> 12:45.240
around having fun?

12:45.280 --> 12:49.720
Because I'm the only person around here that looks this

12:45.280 --> 12:49.720
cool on a bike.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.040
Father Charles?

13:09.640 --> 13:11.800
Yes.

13:11.840 --> 13:15.360
I presume you want to ask me about Angelique.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.960
Detective Inspector Richard Poole.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.920
We understand you found the body

13:17.000 --> 13:18.920
of Angelique Morel.

13:18.960 --> 13:20.280
Yes, poor woman,

13:20.320 --> 13:22.080
but she was old and I think it's no secret

13:22.120 --> 13:24.120
to say her health was deteriorating.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.600
You believe she died of natural causes?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.280
-She was poisoned.

13:28.320 --> 13:31.960
Well, we're still trying to establish the...

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Can you tell us your movements today?

13:34.040 --> 13:36.480
Well, I was in my office this morning

13:34.040 --> 13:36.480
writing a sermon

13:36.520 --> 13:39.280
and I sometimes join the Headmaster for coffee,

13:39.320 --> 13:41.880
so just before 11:00 I headed

13:39.320 --> 13:41.880
towards his classroom.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.760
Did you see anyone else?

13:46.800 --> 13:49.840
I passed Tom Hilton, the caretaker,

13:46.800 --> 13:49.840
in the top corridor.

13:49.880 --> 13:51.360
Morning, Father.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.440
<i>But when I got to</i> <i>the Headmaster's classroom...</i>

13:54.960 --> 13:56.600
Yes?

13:56.640 --> 13:59.360
Well, that's when I saw the body

13:56.640 --> 13:59.360
just lying there.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.520
<i>I didn't know what to do,</i>

14:05.560 --> 14:08.120
<i>so I went and</i> <i>told Molly at once</i>

14:05.560 --> 14:08.120
<i>that I'd found the body.</i>

14:08.160 --> 14:09.960
If you passed the caretaker in the corridor,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.280
did you see where he was coming from?

14:11.640 --> 14:13.080
No.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.480
Could he have been coming from the science room?

14:15.520 --> 14:16.760
I suppose so.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.920
How well did you know Angelique, Father?

14:20.960 --> 14:24.080
I think you can say we moved in different circles.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.000
But you knew she was Mr Dunham's mother

14:26.040 --> 14:27.520
Yes.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.520
-Yes.

14:29.560 --> 14:31.920
His wife passed some while ago.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.240
Do you know how she died?

14:33.280 --> 14:35.520
Yes, I believe it was suicide.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.400
Very sad.

14:39.680 --> 14:42.520
Is there anything else I can help you with?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.440
FIDEL:<i> Sure.</i>

14:45.480 --> 14:47.440
And we're going to need a preliminary autopsy report

14:47.480 --> 14:49.760
as soon as you've got it, okay?

14:49.800 --> 14:51.280
Thank you.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.040
Well, if I'm not arrested, then this is kidnapping.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.080
Tom, how are you doing?

14:56.120 --> 14:57.600
Fidel!

14:57.640 --> 14:59.480
-Boy, you've done some growing.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.480
-Yes, sir.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.920
You hear that? "Sir." That's respect.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.520
Which you might have had, if you'd gone to school.

15:05.560 --> 15:09.520
I went to school. Sometimes.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.920
-They've gone

15:09.560 --> 15:11.920
back to Notre Dame.

15:11.960 --> 15:16.120
Fidel, he dragged me out of Juliana's.

15:11.960 --> 15:16.120
Still half a drink on the bar.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.880
Well, you shouldn't go running off,

15:16.160 --> 15:17.880
should you?

15:20.120 --> 15:22.600
That I'm allowed a phone call.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.640
And a beer.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.000
-No.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.720
How can you say that?

15:32.760 --> 15:35.440
Because I have never at any time

15:32.760 --> 15:35.440
while I've been with you

15:38.680 --> 15:41.320
Okay, first, Angelique must have known her killer.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.680
-Agreed. -Secondly,

15:41.360 --> 15:44.680
to predict her own murder,

15:44.720 --> 15:47.640
she either managed to be in contact with

15:44.720 --> 15:47.640
the spirit world...

15:47.680 --> 15:48.880
Or?

15:48.920 --> 15:51.280
Or she feared her life was in danger somehow

15:51.320 --> 15:52.800
and this was her way of telling us.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.760
Thank you, finally a sensible explanation. Yep, of course.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.240
And thirdly, we should speak to my mother.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.240
Okay, now you've lost me.

16:01.280 --> 16:02.680
I'm pretty sure she knew Angelique.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.560
CATHERINE: You must have heard the story?

16:15.600 --> 16:18.360
-It was a huge scandal.

16:18.400 --> 16:22.640
Nicholas Dunham found out his wife

16:18.400 --> 16:22.640
Delilah was having an affair.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.920
I think you need to hear this.

16:29.440 --> 16:32.200
Must be 15 years ago now.

16:32.240 --> 16:35.320
Nicholas discovered the affair and confronted her.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.040
He begged her not to leave.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.000
And did she?

16:39.040 --> 16:44.360
No one knows what really happened, but Delilah was

16:39.040 --> 16:44.360
such a sweet girl.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.880
People say she was torn between

16:44.400 --> 16:47.880
Nicholas and her lover,

16:47.920 --> 16:49.840
both pulling her in different directions,

16:49.880 --> 16:51.440
until she couldn't cope any more.

16:52.760 --> 16:57.280
Then one night, she went for

16:52.760 --> 16:57.280
a walk across the cliffs

16:57.320 --> 16:58.840
and threw herself into the sea.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.960
-No.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.200
-Sorry.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.920
Was that your stomach again?

17:05.960 --> 17:09.160
Well, there's only so much mango and sweet

17:05.960 --> 17:09.160
potato a man can eat.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.640
Can I cook you something?

17:13.280 --> 17:15.160
Squid

17:16.200 --> 17:17.760
I'm fine, thanks.

17:17.800 --> 17:21.560
-CATHERINE: Poor Angelique. -Dwayne saw her last night.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.440
He said she predicted her own murder.

17:24.360 --> 17:25.920
-RICHARD: Please.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.640
CATHERINE: You don't believe?

17:27.680 --> 17:29.960
What, in people foretelling the future

17:27.680 --> 17:29.960
using chicken bones?

17:30.000 --> 17:31.360
I'm more Church of England, really.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.640
-Mmm.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.080
Almost certainly.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.080
Do you know anything about voodoo?

17:37.120 --> 17:38.120
Yes.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.680
It's all witch doctors and wild hair. You know,

17:42.000 --> 17:46.680
sort of staring eyes.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.200
It was born from slavery and colonisation,

17:50.240 --> 17:53.320
but based on Christianity.

17:53.360 --> 17:57.960
In voodoo, the prayers are Catholic. They even worship

17:53.360 --> 17:57.960
the Catholic saints.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.680
Papa Legba holding the keys to the afterlife,

18:00.720 --> 18:02.520
only because St Peter does.

18:02.560 --> 18:05.040
Well, there you are. You learn

18:02.560 --> 18:05.040
something new every day.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.320
Thanks for your help.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.000
Come on, Camille, lots to do.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.880
-Bye, Mama. -Bye.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.720
RICHARD: Oh!

18:13.760 --> 18:15.960
Delilah Dunham's lover, did you know who he was?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.280
Yes, his name was Charlie Dean.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.800
RICHARD: So Father Charles was having

18:22.200 --> 18:25.800
an affair with Delilah.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.000
I wonder why he didn't tell us that?

18:28.040 --> 18:30.080
So, if her body was never found,

18:30.120 --> 18:31.680
wouldn't it be natural for Angelique to think

18:31.720 --> 18:33.800
that her daughter was maybe murdered?

18:33.840 --> 18:36.760
You mean by Nicholas? Hmm. Well, that would explain why

18:36.800 --> 18:39.720
she was burning photographs of him.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.000
And what if she could prove it, finally?

18:42.040 --> 18:44.760
And she went to see him today to accuse him of murder?

18:44.800 --> 18:46.840
-Oh, that's why she made the prophecy.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.840
-Go on.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.680
It was her insurance policy.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.680
If he killed her next, we were to look

18:48.720 --> 18:50.680
for a scarred man

18:50.720 --> 18:53.360
who might have tried to silence her.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.000
It's Nicholas. He's our killer.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.640
Camille,

18:59.680 --> 19:02.720
see if you can find the file on the disappearance

18:59.680 --> 19:02.720
of Delilah Dunham.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.120
Who are you?

19:04.160 --> 19:07.240
Uh, that's Tom Hilton, Chief. The school caretaker.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.520
-Afternoon. -He's sitting in my chair.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.680
It's hot.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.520
Oh, really? Take him to an interview room.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.440
Thanks. Oh, any news on the autopsy?

19:20.480 --> 19:23.640
It's scheduled for 5:00 this afternoon. They'll send

19:20.480 --> 19:23.640
a preliminary report.

19:23.680 --> 19:24.880
Background checks on the staff?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.280
All clean, except Tom in there.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.000
He's been arrested for almost everything.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.600
-No, sir.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.360
Just theft, drunken behaviour,

19:33.400 --> 19:37.120
receiving stolen goods, driving without a licence

19:33.400 --> 19:37.120
and goat rustling.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.840
Go and take his statement, would you?

19:39.880 --> 19:41.720
Concentrate on who he saw at the school this morning,

19:41.760 --> 19:45.120
-particularly around the science lab.

19:41.760 --> 19:45.120
-Yes, sir.

19:45.160 --> 19:47.800
Chief, I asked around the market

19:47.840 --> 19:51.840
and no one remembers Mr Dunham being there at any

19:47.840 --> 19:51.840
time this morning.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.600
He's a well-known figure.

19:53.640 --> 19:56.400
If he was there like he said he was,

19:53.640 --> 19:56.400
someone should have seen him.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.160
So he lied about his movements.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.680
Oh, and look, my mother was right.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.360
Delilah's body was never found.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.920
Print it out, would you? Fidel.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.680
-Very strict, sir.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.200
When he passed you in the corridor,

20:12.240 --> 20:13.800
it was stand up straight, hands behind your back.

20:13.840 --> 20:16.720
Pompous, stickler. Always had to

20:13.840 --> 20:16.720
have the last word.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.240
He loved putting people in detention.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.720
He is a killer.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.560
Let's bring him in.

20:30.400 --> 20:34.000
Mr Dunham

20:34.040 --> 20:35.680
We've got a few questions we'd like to ask you.

20:35.720 --> 20:37.720
No, I wouldn't.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.320
Well, we're asking politely, but we can do

20:37.760 --> 20:40.320
this the hard way.

20:40.360 --> 20:41.600
NICHOLAS: Oh, don't be so melodramatic.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.600
If you'll excuse me, I have things to do.

20:43.640 --> 20:47.360
In that case, I'm arresting you for the murder of

20:43.640 --> 20:47.360
Angelique Morel.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.240
-You do not have

20:47.400 --> 20:49.240
to say anything,

20:49.280 --> 20:52.360
but it may harm your defence if you do not

20:49.280 --> 20:52.360
mention when questioned

20:52.400 --> 20:54.240
something you later rely on in court.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.480
NICHOLAS: You're making a serious mistake, young lady.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.680
I'm innocent. Now, take these things off.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.280
Don't you know who I am?

21:03.360 --> 21:04.480
What?

21:04.520 --> 21:06.640
I was hoping to make it a bit less official.

21:06.680 --> 21:07.880
He wasn't cooperating.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.920
It's a good job you're not armed.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.680
You'll regret this, young lady.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.840
I believe I'm allowed a phone call.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.000
FIDEL: Okay, well, thank you.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.920
That was the pathologist.

21:43.960 --> 21:46.120
The preliminary report's in

21:46.160 --> 21:49.160
and Angelique definitely died of cyanide poisoning.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.720
We've got the right man.

21:50.760 --> 21:53.360
Can you prove to me that Nicholas

21:50.760 --> 21:53.360
killed Angelique Morel

21:53.400 --> 21:56.720
without using the words "scarred man" or "voodoo"?

21:56.760 --> 21:59.480
Okay, what evidence did you recover

21:56.760 --> 21:59.480
from the scene?

21:59.520 --> 22:00.560
Cyanide.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.080
What are these?

22:03.120 --> 22:05.600
DWAYNE: Fidel found them in the bin by

22:03.120 --> 22:05.600
the door of the lab.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.480
Shard of glass from the sink in the lab.

22:09.520 --> 22:13.120
If you wanted to kill someone, would you really do it in

22:09.520 --> 22:13.120
your place of work?

22:13.160 --> 22:15.240
The thought's crossed my mind.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.720
Nicholas may well not have been

22:17.560 --> 22:19.720
honest with us,

22:19.760 --> 22:21.120
which is why I was happy to bring him in.

22:21.160 --> 22:23.120
But is he really stupid enough to carry out a murder

22:23.160 --> 22:27.360
in his own classroom using poison from a cupboard

22:23.160 --> 22:27.360
only he has a key to?

22:27.400 --> 22:29.680
No, he isn't.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.840
I've just got a phone call from Nicholas Dunham

22:34.880 --> 22:38.200
saying that you've just arrested him for murder.

22:38.240 --> 22:40.400
Please tell me that isn't true.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.600
He carries a lot of influence on this island.

22:46.640 --> 22:51.320
I hope any case you have against him

22:46.640 --> 22:51.320
is completely watertight?

22:51.360 --> 22:53.760
The investigation's ongoing, sir.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.600
You weren't at the market.

22:57.640 --> 23:00.000
We've asked. No one remembers seeing you.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.760
That's because I wasn't there.

23:07.800 --> 23:09.480
-Yes.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.080
And I'll show the Commissioner where I was.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.480
Thank you. RICHARD:<i> If you were here,</i>

23:25.520 --> 23:27.000
<i>why did you lie?</i>

23:27.040 --> 23:28.920
What I was doing here was illegal.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.560
And if you want you can re-arrest me for theft,

23:31.600 --> 23:35.320
but my duty's to my community.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.480
And I'll help them in whatever way I can.

23:37.520 --> 23:41.120
What on earth were you doing in a nunnery that

23:37.520 --> 23:41.120
could count as theft?

23:41.160 --> 23:43.200
It's not a nunnery.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.720
NICHOLAS: <i>Continuez, mes enfants.</i>

23:45.320 --> 23:47.480
It's an orphanage.

23:47.520 --> 23:50.480
Now, the school board paid for some new computers.

23:50.520 --> 23:53.640
But the old ones work perfectly well,

23:50.520 --> 23:53.640
it's an over-indulgence.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.080
So you brought the new ones here instead?

23:56.120 --> 23:59.480
Yes, though Tom did most of the donkey work.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.560
What time was Angelique killed, Camille?

24:01.600 --> 24:04.040
Just before 11:00, sir.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.880
I'm sure the sisters will confirm that I was here

24:06.920 --> 24:09.440
at least 10 minutes before that.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.320
In time for morning tea.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.680
So to be clear, you weren't about

24:11.360 --> 24:13.680
at the time of the murder

24:13.720 --> 24:17.800
because you were doing charity work in an orphanage,

24:13.720 --> 24:17.800
surrounded by nuns.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.000
Yes.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.440
That was humiliating.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.280
CAMILLE: I'm sorry, sir. Arresting

24:26.480 --> 24:29.280
Nicholas was my idea.

24:29.320 --> 24:32.640
He brought it on himself by lying about where he was.

24:32.680 --> 24:36.560
He's a very difficult man. He likes to play games.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.680
I suggest you try not to get on

24:36.600 --> 24:39.680
the wrong side of him.

24:39.720 --> 24:41.440
I was the investigating officer

24:41.480 --> 24:43.720
for his wife's disappearance many years ago.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.200
You concluded it was suicide?

24:45.240 --> 24:48.040
We had little choice, the body was never found.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.760
You knew about the affair with Charles Dean?

24:52.720 --> 24:55.040
She vanished into thin air.

24:55.080 --> 24:58.000
I even dug up Nicholas Dunham's patio.

24:58.040 --> 25:01.320
He was building it just after his wife disappeared.

25:01.360 --> 25:02.960
It's all in the file.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.680
In the end, the only thing that made sense

25:04.720 --> 25:08.400
was that she carried out a threat and threw

25:04.720 --> 25:08.400
herself into the sea.

25:18.720 --> 25:21.120
DWAYNE: So what was this headmaster like

25:18.720 --> 25:21.120
when you was there?

25:21.160 --> 25:22.600
FIDEL: Mr Dunham?

25:22.640 --> 25:26.360
He was okay one minute, but then he

25:22.640 --> 25:26.360
could turn, you know?

25:26.400 --> 25:29.000
I remember I got a new pair of football boots.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.680
It was my birthday, 14, I think.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.760
I shined those boots.

25:33.800 --> 25:37.560
I don't think I've ever been so proud of

25:33.800 --> 25:37.560
anything in my entire life.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.640
When we had our first school match,

25:40.680 --> 25:43.200
Mr Dunham came into the dressing room

25:40.680 --> 25:43.200
and he saw

25:43.240 --> 25:46.480
everyone gathered around admiring my new boots.

25:46.520 --> 25:49.160
Mr Dunham told me that I was being boastful

25:49.200 --> 25:50.560
and that was a bad thing.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.600
And so he took my boots away from me.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.200
-No. -Yeah.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.200
It's a shame we won't be locking him up

25:55.240 --> 25:58.200
any time soon.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.960
Seems his alibi checked out.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.360
And get this, he was with a bunch of nuns.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.920
-I know.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.000
Don't ask.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.680
Why didn't you tell us about your relationship

26:14.720 --> 26:16.880
with Delilah Dunham, Father?

26:18.680 --> 26:21.320
That was 15 years ago now.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.320
Delilah was a keen cyclist.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.240
I was a younger member of the staff.

26:26.280 --> 26:30.480
One day I was at a junction in my car and she slammed

26:26.280 --> 26:30.480
into me and she...

26:30.520 --> 26:32.920
and she broke her arm in two places.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.960
I visited her in hospital as often as I could

26:36.000 --> 26:38.080
and we started having an affair.

26:38.120 --> 26:40.400
When did her husband find out?

26:40.440 --> 26:42.480
Oh, she couldn't bear the deception.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.320
So one night she told him

26:44.360 --> 26:46.040
that she was leaving him and he was heartbroken.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.200
Well, of course, I mean, he had every right to be.

26:48.240 --> 26:52.640
He begged her to stay and I am ashamed to say

26:52.680 --> 26:56.760
that I put so much pressure on her, I told her she

26:52.680 --> 26:56.760
had to leave him.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.400
I gave her no way out.

26:59.320 --> 27:01.760
Before she disappeared,

27:01.800 --> 27:04.320
-No.

27:04.360 --> 27:07.400
She did say at one point that she felt

27:04.360 --> 27:07.400
like ending it all.

27:07.440 --> 27:08.720
You believe she committed suicide?

27:10.920 --> 27:13.000
The day after she vanished,

27:13.040 --> 27:15.520
I resigned my post and joined the seminary.

27:19.040 --> 27:20.640
Now my life is my penance.

27:26.360 --> 27:31.160
Mmm. Your friendship with Nicholas Dunham.

27:32.920 --> 27:35.200
Isn't that a bit odd?

27:35.240 --> 27:38.400
We made our peace a long time ago.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.320
He was destroyed by losing her.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.280
We both were.

27:43.760 --> 27:47.600
Did Angelique believe that Nicholas killed her daughter?

27:47.640 --> 27:50.760
-Yes. Yes, she made no secret about it.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.080
Can I ask why?

27:54.080 --> 27:55.920
Nicholas is no killer.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.000
Ah, yes, of course.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.480
The school priest, you hear the Headmaster's confession,

28:00.040 --> 28:03.480
don't you?

28:04.160 --> 28:05.760
I couldn't possibly say.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.560
-What a sad story. -I know.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.440
You know, I'm surprised they had to

28:15.600 --> 28:18.440
dig up Nicholas's patio.

28:18.480 --> 28:21.000
-It would have fallen apart anyway.

28:21.040 --> 28:24.600
Got a copy of his building supplies

28:21.040 --> 28:24.600
in the original file.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.320
He's got the ratio wrong, see?

28:26.360 --> 28:29.160
Too much lime, not enough sand and cement.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.360
-Thank you.

28:32.400 --> 28:34.160
I know. He may be a scientist,

28:34.200 --> 28:37.080
but he knows next to nothing about grouting.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.560
-What's that got

28:39.040 --> 28:41.560
to do with this?

28:41.600 --> 28:43.800
Well, he could have just taken us

28:41.600 --> 28:43.800
to the orphanage, couldn't he?

28:43.840 --> 28:47.760
Or phoned a solicitor or a lawyer

28:43.840 --> 28:47.760
like a normal person, but no.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.280
Nicholas wanted us humiliated.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.440
Why

28:52.480 --> 28:55.760
But he's got an alibi for the time of the murder.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.840
What's he frightened of?

28:58.880 --> 29:00.720
What if he really is the murderer?

29:00.760 --> 29:03.720
Oh, great. So when I think Nicholas

29:00.760 --> 29:03.720
is guilty and arrest him,

29:03.760 --> 29:05.680
you're not interested.

29:05.720 --> 29:10.640
But the moment he proves he's innocent, suddenly you're

29:05.720 --> 29:10.640
convinced he's guilty?

29:10.680 --> 29:12.720
-Yes.

29:12.760 --> 29:16.400
You are the most annoying man I've ever met.

29:16.440 --> 29:19.040
-Well, it's a very small island.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.480
Right.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.440
I need a hardware store with a pet section,

29:20.520 --> 29:23.440
if possible.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.040
Excuse me?

29:25.080 --> 29:27.400
Our headmaster's not the only one

29:25.080 --> 29:27.400
who can play games.

29:34.240 --> 29:37.000
CAMILLE: Okay, Fidel, I'll pass it on.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.920
What about Tom Hilton's statement?

29:40.960 --> 29:42.480
Okay.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.880
Okay, thanks.

29:44.920 --> 29:48.160
You know, of all the things I thought we might need to

29:44.920 --> 29:48.160
solve this case,

29:48.200 --> 29:50.360
a fish tank was not one of them.

29:50.400 --> 29:52.280
Who was that?

29:52.320 --> 29:54.280
Fidel has finished dusting the available

29:52.320 --> 29:54.280
evidence for prints...

29:54.320 --> 29:56.080
Hang on, don't tell me.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.320
The cyanide bottle from Nicholas's cupboard was

29:56.120 --> 29:58.320
covered in fingerprints

29:58.360 --> 30:01.000
but only Nicholas's, the same is true

29:58.360 --> 30:01.000
of the rum bottle

30:01.040 --> 30:02.880
and one of the shot glasses,

30:02.920 --> 30:06.080
the other had both his and Angelique's

30:02.920 --> 30:06.080
fingerprints on. Step back.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.600
-Yeah, of course.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.800
There's no surprise in everything pointing towards

30:08.640 --> 30:10.800
Nicholas Dunham

30:10.840 --> 30:12.920
being the killer, it's been that

30:10.840 --> 30:12.920
way from the start.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.960
What about Tom Hilton, what did he say

30:12.960 --> 30:14.960
in his interview?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.600
That he heard and saw nothing.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.040
But he reckons he saw Angelique alive in

30:16.640 --> 30:19.040
Nicholas's classroom

30:19.080 --> 30:20.920
after Nicholas left for the orphanage.

30:20.960 --> 30:23.840
How very convenient for Nicholas.

30:23.880 --> 30:27.360
-I'm hoping this

30:23.880 --> 30:27.360
fish tank will tell us.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.600
-Gin and tonic. -Thank you.

31:31.560 --> 31:34.480
I'm trying to work here, so you can stop

31:31.560 --> 31:34.480
looking at me like that.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.320
You look like

31:37.360 --> 31:38.520
my mother.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.560
That is exactly how my mother looks at me.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.160
Yes, I'm taking my vitamins.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.320
Yes, I'm wrapping up warm.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.720
Look, Mum, I'm fine.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.960
It's not as if I'm on the other side

31:50.760 --> 31:52.960
of the...

31:53.000 --> 31:55.520
Oh, God, I'm on the other

31:53.000 --> 31:55.520
side of the world.

31:55.560 --> 31:58.440
Oh, there's my car. Yeah, I'm late for work.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.640
What if there's been a murder or...

32:01.280 --> 32:03.440
Yeah, got to go.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.040
Yep, sure, yep, yep, till next time.

32:08.280 --> 32:09.600
Bye.

32:17.720 --> 32:19.160
I heard voices. You're early.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.520
Don't you get hot at night, wearing all that?

32:26.560 --> 32:28.200
Yes.

32:28.240 --> 32:29.520
Then you should sleep naked.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.480
I do.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.040
Oh.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.840
Shouldn't your lizard be on the inside?

32:43.200 --> 32:46.520
-Oh.

32:46.560 --> 32:48.960
It's a cyanoacrylate fumigation tank.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.760
Oh, funny. Because it looks like

32:50.800 --> 32:52.560
a light bulb in a fish tank to me.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.240
That's where you're wrong. Because it's a light bulb

32:54.280 --> 32:56.640
in a fish tank with super glue,

32:56.680 --> 33:00.320
or cyanoacrylate, to give it its proper name.

33:00.360 --> 33:03.800
Still looks like a light bulb in a fish tank.

33:03.840 --> 33:07.240
The light bulb heats the foil, which heats the super glue,

33:07.280 --> 33:09.680
which evaporates. And here's the clever bit,

33:09.720 --> 33:12.480
once it becomes a gas, the fumes will only stick

33:12.520 --> 33:15.320
to the fatty acids, amino acids

33:12.520 --> 33:15.320
and proteins

33:15.360 --> 33:18.080
that you find in fingerprints.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.200
-Allowing you to

33:18.120 --> 33:20.200
reveal fingerprints

33:20.240 --> 33:24.240
on difficult surfaces such as

33:20.240 --> 33:24.240
the inside of latex gloves.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.920
Fidel,

33:39.960 --> 33:45.240
there are prints on the fingertips

33:39.960 --> 33:45.240
of these gloves.

33:45.280 --> 33:48.480
-Yes, sir.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.040
Okay.

34:02.080 --> 34:06.360
So our headmaster has an alibi that includes

34:02.080 --> 34:06.360
orphans and nuns.

34:08.200 --> 34:10.840
We have a heartbroken priest,

34:12.040 --> 34:14.400
a caretaker with criminal tendencies

34:14.440 --> 34:17.680
and a school secretary whose loyalty knows no bounds.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.600
Yes, and don't forget the voodoo...

34:22.720 --> 34:24.720
And then there's Delilah.

34:27.280 --> 34:30.680
The daughter, wife and lover who vanished into thin air.

34:30.720 --> 34:33.720
And everything always leads back to our headmaster.

34:33.760 --> 34:35.640
Do we arrest him again?

34:35.680 --> 34:39.960
His call to the Commissioner was to intimidate us,

34:35.680 --> 34:39.960
to get us to back off.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.520
So...

34:46.240 --> 34:48.720
So let's show him it hasn't worked.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.720
RICHARD: Ah, yes, the patio.

35:15.920 --> 35:16.920
Hello?

35:21.960 --> 35:23.000
NICHOLAS: What are you doing here?

35:24.280 --> 35:26.160
RICHARD: We have some more questions.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.960
You dare to come here after yesterday?

35:29.000 --> 35:31.560
I'm intrigued you never felt the need to mention your

35:29.000 --> 35:31.560
wife's disappearance.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.120
That was 15 years ago, I don't see how it's relevant.

35:34.160 --> 35:37.520
Surely we should be the judge of that?

35:37.560 --> 35:40.960
We spoke to Father Charles yesterday.

35:37.560 --> 35:40.960
He told us what happened.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.920
Oh, but you already knew that, didn't you?

35:44.880 --> 35:46.640
It's very hot, isn't it?

35:46.680 --> 35:49.480
Perhaps Miss Kerr could bring us

35:46.680 --> 35:49.480
some refreshments.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.360
Lemonade would be fine.

35:55.360 --> 35:58.240
-Uh, Molly and I... -No need to explain.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.000
Really.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.880
You have a beautiful view here.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.040
Yes, I have.

36:05.080 --> 36:06.800
-No.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.400
Oh.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.400
-But it says in your file... -No, the patio I built

36:10.440 --> 36:12.880
when my wife disappeared was, as you know,

36:12.920 --> 36:15.640
dug up by the police shortly afterwards

36:12.920 --> 36:15.640
and they found nothing.

36:15.680 --> 36:17.520
So tell me, when you were ordering

36:15.680 --> 36:17.520
the building supplies...

36:17.560 --> 36:19.880
Don't play games with me, Inspector.

36:19.920 --> 36:23.320
I think you'll find I'm slightly

36:19.920 --> 36:23.320
better at them than you are.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.800
-Lemonade. -Thank you, Miss Kerr.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.160
Thank you.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.360
Why did Angelique come and see you yesterday?

36:31.400 --> 36:33.200
I told you, to borrow some books.

36:33.240 --> 36:36.400
We didn't find any reference books

36:33.240 --> 36:36.400
out in the classroom.

36:36.440 --> 36:37.960
Then she must have put them away.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.640
Or any evidence to suggest you're telling the truth.

36:40.680 --> 36:42.440
I beg your pardon?

36:42.480 --> 36:45.040
Angelique believed you murdered her daughter,

36:42.480 --> 36:45.040
didn't she?

36:45.080 --> 36:48.200
Yes, the ramblings of a mad old woman,

36:45.080 --> 36:48.200
no one took her seriously.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.000
You believe your wife committed suicide?

36:50.040 --> 36:53.800
Obvious to anyone with half a brain,

36:50.040 --> 36:53.800
I would have thought.

36:53.840 --> 36:57.000
We've been to Angelique Morel's

36:53.840 --> 36:57.000
house now.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.920
We know exactly what she thought of you.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.600
Yes, somehow her popping by to borrow a book

37:01.640 --> 37:04.160
and share a glass of rum just doesn't ring true.

37:04.200 --> 37:08.920
So we're going to be asking you the same questions

37:04.200 --> 37:08.920
over and over again

37:08.960 --> 37:11.120
until you tell us the truth.

37:16.760 --> 37:18.480
Very well.

37:18.520 --> 37:21.520
She visited me yesterday to accuse me of murder,

37:21.560 --> 37:22.680
of killing my wife.

37:25.200 --> 37:28.520
The spirits have spoken! Murderer! Murderer!

37:28.560 --> 37:31.360
NICHOLAS: She said I had to confess

37:31.400 --> 37:35.040
or I'd have a voodoo curse put on me that I'd never

37:31.400 --> 37:35.040
be able to break.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.960
NICHOLAS: Enough! I will not let you speak to me like this.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.200
-Confess! <i>-Vieille folle!</i>

37:42.760 --> 37:44.400
You lost your temper with her?

37:44.440 --> 37:46.280
I'm a headmaster, it was in my own school.

37:46.320 --> 37:48.680
I think that should afford me some respect, don't you?

37:48.720 --> 37:51.520
-Mmm-hmm.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.360
-I've no idea.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.280
Then what about evidence?

37:55.320 --> 37:57.120
Did she have any proof to back up her claims?

37:57.160 --> 38:00.080
Of course she didn't.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.000
My Nicholas couldn't hurt anyone.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.000
He's not a killer.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.440
RICHARD: What are we missing?

38:07.480 --> 38:09.880
CATHERINE: He doesn't look very happy. CAMILLE: The case

38:07.480 --> 38:09.880
isn't going very well.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.680
I'm not invisible, you know.

38:11.720 --> 38:14.320
I can hear you. Actually, maybe that's the problem.

38:11.720 --> 38:14.320
I'm invisible.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.320
Why can't we find a motive? It shouldn't be hard.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.600
An old woman's killed. Who benefits?

38:18.640 --> 38:20.440
There's got to be...

38:20.480 --> 38:23.520
There's something we're not getting,

38:20.480 --> 38:23.520
you know? There's some key,

38:23.560 --> 38:25.560
which if we could only identify, it would unlock

38:23.560 --> 38:25.560
the whole case,

38:25.600 --> 38:27.440
I'm sure of it. You know what my

38:27.480 --> 38:29.320
father used to say?

38:29.360 --> 38:32.080
Oh, please let it not be homespun in any way.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.760
If you can't find the right answer,

38:33.800 --> 38:36.440
you've probably been asking the wrong question.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.960
It's as if all the wonders of the universe

38:36.480 --> 38:39.960
were suddenly revealed.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.720
Is he really not eating?

38:43.760 --> 38:45.840
I haven't seen him eat since he got here.

38:45.880 --> 38:49.880
Of course I eat, it's just there's a lot of Caribbean

38:45.880 --> 38:49.880
food in the Caribbean.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.680
You can't solve crime on an empty stomach.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.280
Fine, then I'll, you know...

39:00.920 --> 39:03.680
-Rum, lime and ice.

39:03.720 --> 39:06.400
I hate lime!

39:09.760 --> 39:12.680
Oh, oh. Nobody move.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.320
But how can we...

39:22.600 --> 39:23.920
Of course.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.280
Sir, I have...

39:34.760 --> 39:37.560
I have the results on the latex gloves

39:34.760 --> 39:37.560
I found in the bin.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.120
I already know who was wearing them.

39:39.160 --> 39:41.600
-But I haven't told you yet. -I know, you don't need to.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.600
Oh, you know who the murderer is?

39:43.640 --> 39:45.880
Gather everyone in Nicholas's classroom.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.880
Oh, and the Commissioner.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.640
He's going to want to see this.

39:47.680 --> 39:49.280
Good work, team!

39:50.640 --> 39:52.520
And thanks, Catherine, your father was

39:50.640 --> 39:52.520
right after all.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.400
The rum cocktail was the answer.

39:54.440 --> 39:57.200
I've just been asking the wrong question.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.600
RICHARD: This case has been

40:05.560 --> 40:07.600
impossible from the start.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.320
A voodoo prediction that couldn't be true,

40:09.360 --> 40:11.080
evidence that pointed at only one man

40:11.120 --> 40:15.480
and all this time, this nagging sense

40:11.120 --> 40:15.480
that I was missing something.

40:15.520 --> 40:18.480
Tom, my team have never believed you were

40:15.520 --> 40:18.480
a credible murder suspect

40:18.520 --> 40:19.880
and they were right.

40:19.920 --> 40:23.160
You may have stolen a few computers for charity,

40:23.200 --> 40:25.480
-No.

40:25.520 --> 40:29.040
Any more than you did, Father Charles. I mean,

40:25.520 --> 40:29.040
you discovered the body.

40:29.080 --> 40:30.680
But you're not a murderer, either.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.680
But you did give us one crucial

40:30.720 --> 40:33.680
piece of information.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.240
It's no secret to say her health was deteriorating.

40:36.280 --> 40:39.800
Because you talked about Angelique as though she

40:36.280 --> 40:39.800
were already dying,

40:39.840 --> 40:42.040
plenty of evidence of which can be found at her house.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.160
RICHARD: <i>These are pretty hardcore.</i>

40:45.200 --> 40:46.560
Isn't that right, Father?

40:46.600 --> 40:48.360
I can't break the seal of the confessional.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.040
She came to confession?

40:50.080 --> 40:53.120
She's dead, Father. You'll be helping

40:50.080 --> 40:53.120
catch her killer.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.440
She had severe heart disease and the way she put it,

40:56.480 --> 40:59.360
she said she was dying of a broken heart.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.800
So when I found the body, I just thought

40:59.400 --> 41:02.800
she'd had a coronary.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.440
But when you told me

41:04.480 --> 41:07.040
-that she was murdered... -This was no coronary.

41:07.080 --> 41:09.720
The pathologist's report is clear.

41:09.760 --> 41:13.080
Angelique died from a fatal dose of cyanide.

41:14.160 --> 41:17.720
Which leaves us only two suspects.

41:17.760 --> 41:20.200
Let's take a moment to consider

41:17.760 --> 41:20.200
Angelique's voodoo prophecy.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.120
Oh, you don't believe that claptrap,

41:20.240 --> 41:22.120
do you?

41:22.160 --> 41:24.760
The warning clearly pointed the finger

41:22.160 --> 41:24.760
of suspicion at you, Nicholas,

41:24.800 --> 41:26.160
the scarred man.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.840
And it's obvious, isn't it, when you think about it.

41:27.880 --> 41:29.920
I mean, this is your classroom,

41:27.880 --> 41:29.920
your poisons,

41:29.960 --> 41:31.280
only you could have killed her.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.800
But you know where I was.

41:33.840 --> 41:37.400
The dream alibi? Orphans and nuns, no less.

41:37.440 --> 41:39.520
You could have killed her before you left,

41:37.440 --> 41:39.520
then begged Tom

41:39.560 --> 41:41.280
to lie about seeing her alone.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.840
'Cause that's what you do, isn't it,

41:41.320 --> 41:42.840
Headmaster?

41:42.880 --> 41:45.000
You demand the loyalty and the respect of others.

41:45.040 --> 41:47.200
-Just a minute... -RICHARD: Then it struck me.

41:47.240 --> 41:49.920
Everything about Angelique's death

41:47.240 --> 41:49.920
was carefully constructed

41:49.960 --> 41:51.600
to frame you for her murder.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.600
You've been set up, Mr Dunham, from the start.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.320
You didn't kill Angelique Morel.

41:56.360 --> 41:58.120
And seeing as we know Tom didn't kill her

41:58.160 --> 42:02.080
and Father Charles didn't kill her

41:58.160 --> 42:02.080
and now you didn't kill her,

42:02.120 --> 42:05.560
that only leaves you, Miss Kerr,

42:02.120 --> 42:05.560
the perfect secretary.

42:05.600 --> 42:08.200
The person who's always there to pick up the pieces.

42:08.240 --> 42:09.560
I'm pretty sure you could have acquired

42:09.600 --> 42:11.560
the key to the poison cupboard any time you wanted.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.600
And you knew where he kept his stash of rum.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.680
But why

42:15.720 --> 42:18.120
And there we have it again. Why?

42:18.160 --> 42:19.800
Don't worry, Miss Kerr.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.680
You didn't kill Angelique any more

42:19.840 --> 42:21.680
than the other three did.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.120
Then who?

42:23.160 --> 42:25.880
RICHARD: The voodoo prophecy was the key after all.

42:25.920 --> 42:29.200
There's only one way that Angelique

42:25.920 --> 42:29.200
could have known

42:29.240 --> 42:31.280
she'd be murdered within 24 hours

42:29.240 --> 42:31.280
of her prophecy

42:31.320 --> 42:34.600
and that all the evidence would point to Mr Dunham.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.720
Clever, isn't it

42:43.320 --> 42:44.560
Camille?

42:49.040 --> 42:50.400
She killed herself

42:50.440 --> 42:52.800
to frame Nicholas for her murder

42:50.440 --> 42:52.800
from beyond the grave.

42:54.520 --> 42:57.720
It's like Father Charles said, Angelique knew she was dying.

42:57.760 --> 43:01.400
At least this way, her death would

42:57.760 --> 43:01.400
have some meaning.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.320
<i>She knew Dwayne</i> <i>was a police officer</i>

43:03.360 --> 43:05.880
<i>and she knew</i> <i>that when she made</i>

43:03.360 --> 43:05.880
<i>a prediction...</i>

43:05.920 --> 43:07.240
A scarred man.

43:07.280 --> 43:10.520
<i>...she was telling the police</i> <i>who to suspect.</i>

43:10.560 --> 43:13.320
Yes, but luckily I didn't fall for it.

43:16.680 --> 43:19.320
But seeing as she couldn't get into the poisons cupboard,

43:19.360 --> 43:22.120
how did she get hold of the cyanide

43:19.360 --> 43:22.120
that killed her?

43:22.160 --> 43:23.640
Oh, and you were right, Headmaster,

43:23.680 --> 43:26.120
about there being no poisons missing from the cupboard.

43:26.160 --> 43:27.280
You see, she brought her own.

43:29.560 --> 43:32.680
Angelique studied herbal remedies. There wasn't

43:29.560 --> 43:32.680
a plant on the island

43:32.720 --> 43:34.280
she didn't know and understand the properties of,

43:34.320 --> 43:37.360
including one specific variety found at her house.

43:45.680 --> 43:48.880
Cassava. Which if you boil and drain off the liquid...

43:48.920 --> 43:50.040
Gives you cyanide.

43:54.800 --> 43:58.240
Her plan was simple. She laced her own

43:54.800 --> 43:58.240
rum with cyanide,

43:58.280 --> 43:59.960
then replaced the bottle back in the drawer,

44:00.000 --> 44:02.360
knowing that Nicholas's fingerprints

44:00.000 --> 44:02.360
would be on everything.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.880
That's why we found a shard of glass in the sink,

44:04.920 --> 44:06.680
because that's how she disposed

44:04.920 --> 44:06.680
of the vial.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.760
Can you prove any of this?

44:10.800 --> 44:13.200
Fidel found some latex gloves in the waste bin there

44:13.240 --> 44:16.040
with only Angelique's fingerprints inside them,

44:13.240 --> 44:16.040
isn't that right, Fidel?

44:16.080 --> 44:17.080
Yes, sir.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.640
RICHARD:<i> So, with the scene</i> <i>set to look like murder,</i>

44:22.680 --> 44:24.160
<i>all she had to do now</i> <i>was provide a corpse.</i>

44:26.120 --> 44:27.120
Her own.

44:59.600 --> 45:02.080
Then Angelique wasn't murdered.

45:02.120 --> 45:05.680
No, her death was tragic. Criminal intent.

45:05.720 --> 45:07.240
It was suicide, that's all.

45:07.280 --> 45:08.640
Poor woman.

45:08.680 --> 45:10.760
So, that's it, is that what you're saying?

45:10.800 --> 45:13.120
-Absolutely.

45:13.160 --> 45:14.960
You're free to go, thank you for

45:13.160 --> 45:14.960
your cooperation.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.480
No, thank you, Detective Inspector,

45:15.000 --> 45:18.480
thank you for your discretion.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.880
Apart from you, Headmaster, I'm arresting you for murder.

45:20.920 --> 45:22.280
You just said that she committed suicide.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.360
Not of Angelique. Of your wife, Delilah.

45:25.400 --> 45:27.000
But you can't possibly...

45:27.040 --> 45:28.520
Angelique believed you'd murdered her daughter.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.080
Angelique was mad, raving.

45:30.120 --> 45:31.920
Driven mad, perhaps, 'cause she knew you'd

45:30.120 --> 45:31.920
killed her daughter

45:31.960 --> 45:33.120
but could never prove it.

45:33.160 --> 45:35.000
But I'm innocent. Take these damn things off!

45:35.040 --> 45:37.320
Leave the poor man alone. He went through

45:35.040 --> 45:37.320
this 15 years ago.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.720
You'll never be able to prove anybody killed

45:37.360 --> 45:39.720
that stupid woman.

45:39.760 --> 45:41.960
Ah, but that's just the thing. I can.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.760
You see, anybody can commit murder.

45:42.000 --> 45:45.760
Murder's the easy part.

45:45.800 --> 45:48.680
It's how to dispose of the body.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.960
That's where most murderers fail,

45:48.720 --> 45:50.960
how they get caught.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.560
The breakthrough came when I was

45:51.000 --> 45:53.560
drinking a local cocktail,

45:53.600 --> 45:57.840
it was just rum, lime and ice but it tasted

45:53.600 --> 45:57.840
like paint stripper.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.200
Maybe the recipe was wrong,

45:59.240 --> 46:02.280
but how can it be? The ingredients are so simple.

46:02.320 --> 46:04.040
Just as they were

46:04.080 --> 46:05.640
of that patio you built all those years ago.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.600
You see, sand and cement, they were fine,

46:07.640 --> 46:10.480
but there was something you'd ordered much too much of,

46:07.640 --> 46:10.480
wasn't there?

46:10.520 --> 46:12.240
Lime.

46:12.280 --> 46:15.440
So what did you do with all those kilograms of

46:12.280 --> 46:15.440
lime you had spare?

46:15.480 --> 46:17.880
It's a powdered alkaline metal,

46:15.480 --> 46:17.880
isn't it?

46:17.920 --> 46:20.600
If you add water to it, you get calcium hydroxide,

46:20.640 --> 46:23.800
better known as slaked lime or quick lime.

46:23.840 --> 46:27.680
And quick lime is capable of dissolving

46:23.840 --> 46:27.680
the flesh off human bones

46:27.720 --> 46:29.720
in a matter of days.

46:29.760 --> 46:33.440
No, I return to my original question. How do you

46:29.760 --> 46:33.440
dispose of a human body?

46:33.480 --> 46:35.080
Well, if you're a science teacher,

46:35.120 --> 46:38.640
a headmaster who demands loyalty,

46:35.120 --> 46:38.640
demands respect,

46:38.680 --> 46:41.160
someone who likes humiliating police officers

46:41.200 --> 46:44.560
in front of their superiors, then maybe you

46:41.200 --> 46:44.560
don't dispose of it.

46:44.600 --> 46:48.120
Maybe you display it, pride of place,

46:49.000 --> 46:50.480
in your classroom.

46:52.520 --> 46:56.680
You've been teaching in this room, gloating over her

46:52.520 --> 46:56.680
for the last 15 years.

46:56.720 --> 46:58.800
-But I didn't kill her. -Lies!

46:58.840 --> 47:01.680
Molly... Molly, believe me.

47:01.720 --> 47:06.520
I'm going to make a prophecy now, like poor,

47:01.720 --> 47:06.520
sweet, deluded Angelique.

47:06.560 --> 47:09.520
But mine will come true, because it's not

47:06.560 --> 47:09.520
based on faith,

47:09.560 --> 47:12.560
it's based on your subject, science.

47:12.600 --> 47:14.840
Look, Father, I'm sorry to do this to you,

47:12.600 --> 47:14.840
but all those years ago,

47:14.880 --> 47:18.080
when Delilah had her bicycle accident,

47:18.120 --> 47:22.560
she broke her arm in two places.

47:18.120 --> 47:22.560
Do you remember which bones?

47:22.600 --> 47:25.480
It was the humerus and the radius.

47:34.720 --> 47:36.120
RICHARD: Angelique hoped

47:36.160 --> 47:38.720
that her death would put her daughter's

47:36.160 --> 47:38.720
killer behind bars

47:38.760 --> 47:41.760
and here's my prediction, it will.

47:41.800 --> 47:44.000
Because we'll be able to use Angelique's DNA

47:41.800 --> 47:44.000
to prove that these

47:44.040 --> 47:47.080
are the mortal remains of her daughter Delilah.

47:47.120 --> 47:49.680
I told you she'd never leave me for you.

47:51.160 --> 47:53.200
All right, that's enough!

47:53.240 --> 47:56.400
Fidel, perhaps you'd like to take

47:53.240 --> 47:56.400
Mr Dunham into detention.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.560
-Yes, sir.

48:08.560 --> 48:11.480
Well, the prophecy was right in one respect.

48:11.520 --> 48:14.160
The truth was in the bones after all.

48:19.960 --> 48:21.920
So, seeing as you're now into prophecies,

48:21.960 --> 48:23.840
how about I make one I know will come true?

48:23.880 --> 48:25.360
RICHARD: Go on.

48:25.400 --> 48:27.240
If I ask you out for a drink with me and the team tonight,

48:27.280 --> 48:29.280
you'll refuse to come.

48:29.320 --> 48:32.160
Well, you're wrong, I'd love to do that.

48:32.200 --> 48:35.040
Unfortunately, I've got an errand

48:32.200 --> 48:35.040
to run, you know.

48:35.080 --> 48:36.920
Sorry, and dinner to prepare,

48:36.960 --> 48:41.160
so maybe we could all do something

48:36.960 --> 48:41.160
together some other time.

48:52.680 --> 48:54.600
DWAYNE: Hey, what's up?

48:55.720 --> 48:57.680
Poor Angelique.

48:57.720 --> 48:59.800
That she'd do that.

48:59.840 --> 49:02.320
She got her man in the end, though.

49:02.360 --> 49:04.120
Yeah.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.240
I suppose we should be grateful we got to

49:04.160 --> 49:07.240
the bottom of her prophecy.

49:07.280 --> 49:09.080
It just wasn't true.

49:09.120 --> 49:11.160
But she couldn't have known the truth

49:09.120 --> 49:11.160
was in the bones, could she?

49:11.200 --> 49:13.200
So where did that bit come from?

49:13.240 --> 49:15.280
It's just a phrase.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.720
What's that?

49:17.920 --> 49:19.880
Here, go ahead, open it.

49:20.760 --> 49:21.760
Go on.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.280
When you have your baby,

49:33.320 --> 49:35.040
he's going to need a pair of football boots.

49:35.080 --> 49:37.320
Thank you, Dwayne.

49:37.360 --> 49:41.000
Or little girl, whatever you're going to have.

49:41.040 --> 49:42.680
Point being,

49:42.720 --> 49:45.480
whenever they need some boots, they've got some.

49:45.520 --> 49:47.320
And they're brand new.

49:56.760 --> 50:01.080
Then how about this one?

50:02.640 --> 50:06.680
If eight out of 10 cats have a preference,

50:02.640 --> 50:06.680
can't one lizard?

50:06.720 --> 50:07.800
CAMILLE: Ah.

50:11.920 --> 50:16.400
So that's what you meant when you said you

50:11.920 --> 50:16.400
had dinner to prepare?

50:16.440 --> 50:18.440
You know I said I never know what you're thinking?

50:18.480 --> 50:21.080
-Yeah. -I know what you're thinking.

50:21.120 --> 50:23.720
You haven't the first idea.

50:23.760 --> 50:27.040
-Yes.

50:27.080 --> 50:29.880
My mother's cooking you dinner tonight,

50:29.920 --> 50:31.960
to celebrate catching Delilah's killer,

50:32.000 --> 50:35.240
for which there's a lot of people on this island

50:32.000 --> 50:35.240
who are grateful.

50:35.280 --> 50:39.840
So she says you can't refuse, as she's preparing

50:35.280 --> 50:39.840
you an English feast

50:39.880 --> 50:41.480
of roast beef...

50:42.880 --> 50:45.160
Hang on, I wrote it down, um...

50:45.200 --> 50:47.560
Yorkshire pudding,

50:47.600 --> 50:51.480
roast potatoes and horseradish sauce?

50:53.240 --> 50:55.240
You had me at roast beef.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.560
Oh!

51:25.840 --> 51:28.040
CHARLES: So lucky. RICHARD: That's amazing, look.
