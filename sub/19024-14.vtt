Did you ask her?

to think about it,

it to you before you left,

03:57.166 --> 03:58.750
No, Kevin.
That's not gonna work.

Well, I'm a businessman.
We can work something out.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.583
Let me see. I sent you
to college and med school,

04:03.667 --> 04:05.417
and you have
done nothing for me,

04:05.500 --> 04:07.500
so, I tell you what,
I'll sleep on the couch,

04:07.583 --> 04:08.917
and you cut me a check
for 80 grand.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.333
-I'll go get my pillow.
-Yeah.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.542

That was good, Kev.

04:12.625 --> 04:14.959
We should make him like,
make dinner for us tonight.

04:15.041 --> 04:16.583

own personal slave.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.458

04:19.250 --> 04:21.667
Oh, no, I don't mean
like that kind of slave.

04:21.750 --> 04:24.208
Well, how 'bout this?
How 'bout he be the house slave,

04:24.291 --> 04:25.542
and I be the field slave?

04:25.625 --> 04:27.041
That sound like fun to you?

04:27.125 --> 04:28.834
Nah, that wouldn't be fun.

04:36.917 --> 04:38.583
No, honey,
the reason we're late

04:38.667 --> 04:40.166
is that you took forever

04:57.166 --> 04:58.500
flitting about
these halls anymore

04:58.583 --> 05:00.583

and I'm going to be holding her
claw the entire time,

05:09.333 --> 05:10.917
so, what you've just done

05:11.000 --> 05:13.250
is essentially volunteer
to do all of your work

05:13.333 --> 05:14.667
and all of mine.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.166
And if you'll step
right this way,

05:16.250 --> 05:19.125

you more about what you've won.

-Split pea soup today.

05:21.875 --> 05:22.875

You know, sir,
Dr. Townshend here

05:24.458 --> 05:26.250

some great old stories

05:26.333 --> 05:27.333
about the hospital.

05:27.417 --> 05:28.917
I'd love to hear one sometime.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.083
Well, what the hell.

05:31.625 --> 05:34.166

I don't like you.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.333

05:36.834 --> 05:39.166
-He tells that one a lot.
-I know.

05:39.834 --> 05:42.000
Look, I know you're laboring
over this whole proposal thing,

05:42.083 --> 05:43.458
so I thought
I'd sweeten the pot

05:43.542 --> 05:45.625
by letting you know I have
a killer best man's toast.

05:45.709 --> 05:46.875
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.709
I'm gonna rush the biggest
decision of my life

05:48.792 --> 05:51.291
so I can hear you say,
"when I first met Chris Turk,

05:51.375 --> 05:54.750
I knew this was a guy I could
party with forever. Yeah."

05:54.834 --> 05:55.834

(J.D.)
<i>What Carla didn't know</i>

-Say what?
-I couldn't take it anymore.

06:19.917 --> 06:21.333
I had to get the hell outta
there.

06:21.417 --> 06:23.208

06:44.667 --> 06:47.166
So, are we finding out
the sex of the baby today?

06:47.250 --> 06:48.834
-Yes, we are.
-No, we're not.

06:48.917 --> 06:50.291
Jordan, be reasonable.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.625
If you're incubating
some kind of man-bat in there,

06:52.709 --> 06:54.375
we should find out about it
as soon as possible.

06:54.458 --> 06:56.500
There are vaccinations
to consider.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.542
Tell you what. We'll compromise.

06:58.875 --> 07:01.875
I'll decide this,
and you get to decide...

07:01.959 --> 07:04.083
Um...
Sorry. I got nothing.

07:04.166 --> 07:07.041
Look, it's common for each
parent to feel differently.

07:07.125 --> 07:10.458
Actually, I'm not the father,
he's a bellboy in Greece.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.333

We think.

07:12.417 --> 07:13.500
(disgusted) Neat.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.375

07:40.458 --> 07:42.583
Why you keep
doing these things to me.

07:42.667 --> 07:43.959
I don't know, either.

07:44.417 --> 07:47.208
Well, if it isn't my favorite
custodial engineer.

07:47.291 --> 07:49.208
-Listen, do me a favor, will ya?
-Yeah?

07:49.667 --> 07:51.083

07:51.500 --> 07:52.917

07:58.083 --> 07:59.083
So, look, Chris,

07:59.166 --> 08:01.250

but what do you say

08:01.333 --> 08:03.625

08:03.709 --> 08:05.000

08:05.083 --> 08:07.250
Well, get somebody

08:07.333 --> 08:08.750
Man, I'm only here
for the weekend.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.250
Look, I just asked
Carla to marry me,

08:11.333 --> 08:12.917
and you were in there
actin' like a jerk.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.917
Oh, man, you're engaged?
Congratulations.

08:18.458 --> 08:20.333
She hasn't exactly
said yes yet.

08:20.417 --> 08:21.709
Oh, that's all right.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.667
Sometimes the ladies
just need to sleep on it.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.000
I asked her a week ago.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.417
-Damn.
-Yeah.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.583
Well, on the bright side,

08:27.667 --> 08:29.667
you are definitely
flyin' solo tonight, huh?

08:29.750 --> 08:30.834
(laughing)

08:30.917 --> 08:32.166
I'm out.

08:33.083 --> 08:35.250
Hey, Chris, come on, now.
I was just playin'.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.250
(fake sob)
Chris!

08:40.667 --> 08:42.000
If you really don't
wanna know the sex,

08:42.083 --> 08:43.834
it's time to look away.

08:43.917 --> 08:44.917
(knock at door)

08:45.000 --> 08:47.458
(Elliot) Dr. Cox,
I excuse me, um...

08:47.542 --> 08:49.458
-I gotta just-- need your--
-Abababa.

08:50.792 --> 08:52.291
You know, Jordan,
this is ridiculous,

08:52.375 --> 08:53.625
I'm gonna find out
the sex of the baby.

08:53.709 --> 08:56.125
(Jordan) Yeah, Dr. Gerson's not
gonna tell you.

08:56.875 --> 08:59.208
-Oh, look.
-Oh, gosh,

08:59.291 --> 09:02.250
I guess I'm stuck, then.
Alrighty.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.500
(whistles) (snaps, whistles)

09:04.583 --> 09:07.083
(mouthing)

09:07.166 --> 09:08.166
Go.

09:10.291 --> 09:11.458
Out.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.750
Sir, can I
call you "Townsie"?

09:14.834 --> 09:15.834
-No.
-Oh.

09:15.917 --> 09:18.333
(J.D.) <i>I was having a great</i>
<i>time working with Townsie.</i>

09:18.959 --> 09:20.375
Now...

09:20.458 --> 09:21.959
Mr. Singer here needs a swan,

09:22.041 --> 09:23.875
so why don't you go ahead
and do an I.J. cutdown.

09:23.959 --> 09:25.291
(J.D.) <i>A cutdown?</i>

09:25.750 --> 09:27.250
<i>No one does those anymore.</i>

09:27.375 --> 09:29.125
Uh, sir, shouldn't I just do
a modified Seldinger?

09:29.208 --> 09:30.291
I mean, it's so much safer.

09:30.375 --> 09:32.959
Nah. Come on,
let's do old school<i>.</i>

09:33.625 --> 09:35.041
-But, sir, I don't--
-Grab a scalpel.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.458
I'll get the
kit.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.458
Somebody?

09:38.542 --> 09:39.709
(J.D.) <i>So often in a hospital,</i>

09:39.792 --> 09:41.792
<i>you feel like you're</i>
<i>alone on an island.</i>

09:44.291 --> 09:48.875
<i>Whether it's because you just can't bring</i>
<i>yourself to make a really important decision...</i>

09:50.500 --> 09:53.250
<i>or because you're</i>
<i>waiting for an answer...</i>

09:57.583 --> 10:00.000
<i>or simply because you know</i>
<i>a secret you wish you didn't.</i>

10:03.166 --> 10:04.542
<i>For me, I was stuck</i>
<i>on that island</i>

10:04.625 --> 10:05.959
because somebody else
put me there.

10:06.041 --> 10:08.500
Okay, come on now.
Just cut through.

10:09.458 --> 10:10.625
Good.

10:10.709 --> 10:12.500
Now, open up the vein,

10:12.542 --> 10:15.041
but be careful not to nick
the carotid artery.

10:17.208 --> 10:18.667
Oh, boy.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.333
(J.D.) <i>Oh, no.</i>

10:23.959 --> 10:26.083
The vascular surgeon on call
said to say you could pick up

10:26.166 --> 10:27.250
your patient this evening.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.917
He also said to say he could
give you a loaner patient

10:30.000 --> 10:31.792
if you needed someone
to butcher until then...

10:32.500 --> 10:33.709
but I didn't really get it.

10:33.792 --> 10:37.083
-No one expects you to, son.
-Okay. Thanks.

10:38.166 --> 10:40.000
(J.D.) <i>All right, this sucks,</i>
<i>but as bad as I feel,</i>

10:40.083 --> 10:41.834
<i>I'm sure Dr. Townshend</i>
<i>feels even worse</i>

10:41.917 --> 10:43.291
<i>for making me do the procedure.</i>

10:43.375 --> 10:45.792
Don't worry about it.
I'll take the blame. Okay?

10:49.667 --> 10:50.750
(J.D.) <i>He hides it well.</i>

10:51.458 --> 10:53.208
Do you really think he wants
to get married?

10:53.625 --> 10:55.166
Listen, any guy
who would be willing

10:55.250 --> 10:56.583
to scour the face of the Earth

10:56.667 --> 10:58.583
to find the world's
smallest diamond ring

10:58.667 --> 11:01.083
clearly knows just
exactly what he wants.

11:01.166 --> 11:03.166
I just don't know
if he's mature enough.

11:03.250 --> 11:04.583
I mean, he couldn't
stop giggling

11:04.667 --> 11:06.667
when he found out
he had to operate on Mr. Weiner.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.625
(laughing)

11:08.709 --> 11:10.250
It's a funny name.

11:10.333 --> 11:11.917
-Stop it.
-Look...

11:12.500 --> 11:14.000
The guy's 27 years old.

11:14.083 --> 11:15.083
He's a surgeon

11:15.166 --> 11:18.166
currently involved in a long
term monogamous relationship,

11:18.250 --> 11:19.583
and as much as I'd love
to trash him,

11:19.667 --> 11:21.834
I'm afraid I'm not down
with the whole maturity thing.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.250
Barbie--

11:24.125 --> 11:25.875
Barbie, look, I need you to go
down to the lab

11:25.959 --> 11:27.291
and get Mrs. Miller's bloodwork.

11:27.375 --> 11:29.875
I also need you to disimpact
Mr. Burnett in 317,

11:29.959 --> 11:31.959
and what did you say the sex
of the child was?

11:32.875 --> 11:34.041
I've got a better idea.

11:34.125 --> 11:36.125
You do those things,
and when you're done,

11:36.208 --> 11:37.709
I'll think about
telling you the sex.

11:37.792 --> 11:40.208
Huh, that's weird. It seems like
you just went to a swap meet

11:40.291 --> 11:41.542
and got yourself a big-boy
spine.

11:41.625 --> 11:44.041
-Now, listen, you tell or else--
-Or else what?

11:44.125 --> 11:46.959
You'll treat me...
worse than you usually do?

11:47.041 --> 11:48.750
Here's the inside scoop, Perry.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.792
For the first time,
I have leverage.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.375
You're familiar with leverage,
right?

11:52.458 --> 11:55.083
It's what you're going to need
when you disimpact Mr. Burnett,

11:55.166 --> 11:56.333
who, by the way,
is so locked up,

11:56.417 --> 11:57.834
I'm guessin' he's been
eatin' either gum,

11:57.917 --> 11:59.125
rubber cement or cork.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.291
Look, Barbie--

12:00.375 --> 12:02.333
Yeah, that's not my name.

12:02.417 --> 12:06.458
Fine, Dr. Reid. Really?

12:07.125 --> 12:08.375
What?

12:08.458 --> 12:09.583
Nothing.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.333
Elliot Reid
in the house.

12:16.625 --> 12:17.709
Sit.

12:18.333 --> 12:19.834
Uh, no, thanks. I'll just, uh--

12:19.917 --> 12:21.083
I'm not askin'.

12:22.583 --> 12:24.792
All right, guys, this is the kid
I was telling you about.

12:24.875 --> 12:25.875
We're gonna look out for him.

12:25.959 --> 12:27.625
This is Brent
from parking.

12:28.041 --> 12:29.458
He's gonna set you up
with a sweet spot

12:29.542 --> 12:32.041
right at the main entrance
so you'll never be late again.

12:33.125 --> 12:35.041
This is crazy-eyes Margo
from housekeeping.

12:35.125 --> 12:37.458
She's gonna make sure that
you got freshly pressed scrubs

12:37.542 --> 12:38.917
in your locker every morning.

12:39.709 --> 12:40.875
Course, this is Troy.

12:40.959 --> 12:42.625
You know him
from the cafeteria line.

12:42.709 --> 12:44.542
He's gonna stop spittin'
in your food.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.041
Thank you for that.

12:47.125 --> 12:48.792
I still don't understand

12:48.875 --> 12:50.291
why we've gotta
be nice to this punk.

12:50.375 --> 12:51.959
-'Cause I said so.
-Yeah, but--

12:52.041 --> 12:54.583
Troy... no more warnings.

12:55.417 --> 12:56.500
Ho!

12:56.583 --> 12:57.667
Bring the hands in.

13:00.166 --> 13:01.041
Bless us, o Lord,

13:01.125 --> 13:02.667
in these thy gifts which we are
about to receive,

13:02.750 --> 13:04.417
from thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord, amen.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.125
Look out for each
and every one of us

13:06.208 --> 13:07.208
including our new member.

13:07.834 --> 13:10.291
Also... help Margo to find
her way home tonight.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.166
(J.D.) <i>Still, something</i>
<i>was bothering me.</i>

13:13.750 --> 13:14.750
Bob, come on.

13:14.834 --> 13:16.834
How many more times are
you gonna make me apologize

13:16.917 --> 13:18.291
for introducing you to your
wife?

13:18.375 --> 13:20.709
Once a month
until she's dead.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.625
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a second?

13:22.709 --> 13:26.375
Sport, what did I tell you
about my open-door policy?

13:26.792 --> 13:28.000
I don't have one.

13:28.083 --> 13:31.208
Dr. Kelso, I was the one who
nicked the artery on Mr. Singer.

13:31.291 --> 13:34.083
Oh, cheese and rice, son.
I just said it was me!

13:34.959 --> 13:36.250
You need to shape up, son.

13:36.333 --> 13:38.917
Lord knows you're never gonna
get by on your looks.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.208
All right, first of all,
at the very least,

13:41.291 --> 13:42.500
I'm interesting-looking.

13:42.583 --> 13:44.917
All right? And secondly, I...

13:45.750 --> 13:47.166
feel I made that mistake

13:47.250 --> 13:49.583
because Dr. Townshend
forced me to perform a procedure

13:49.667 --> 13:52.834
that is unsafe and outdated.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.417
(J.D.) <i>Sorry, Townsie.</i>

13:56.959 --> 13:58.291
Now, let me get this straight.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.458
You screwed up doing something

14:00.542 --> 14:01.875
you should've been able
to handle,

14:01.959 --> 14:03.625
and now you're
in here to tattle

14:03.709 --> 14:05.875
on the very guy who's
taking the bullet for you.

14:06.542 --> 14:07.542
Is that right?

14:09.333 --> 14:11.667
Do me a favor, will ya, son?
Grab that for me?

14:12.417 --> 14:14.333
Ugh.
Thanks.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.375
I'm sorry, sir.

14:26.375 --> 14:27.709
(Dr. Wen)
Kelly clamp.

14:27.792 --> 14:29.792
(Turk) One Kelly clamp
comin' right up.

14:29.875 --> 14:30.875
Hey, Rowdy.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.333
(Dr. Wen) You seem distracted.
Is something wrong?

14:34.917 --> 14:38.417
No, sir.
I call everyone... Rowdy.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.792
Well, what did you want me to
do, leave him in the car?

14:40.875 --> 14:42.792
It's bad enough you freaked out
my girlfriend,

14:42.875 --> 14:43.875
but now you wanna
get me fired.

14:43.959 --> 14:45.250
Why don't you just
smack me in my face?

14:45.333 --> 14:46.625
Fine.

14:46.709 --> 14:47.792
Hey, check this out.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.625
I can't believe that
you're givin' me attitude.

14:50.709 --> 14:52.458
I've taken care of you
your entire life,

14:52.542 --> 14:54.542
and I come in, and I tell you
that I'm getting divorced,

14:54.625 --> 14:55.959
and you make it all about you.

14:56.041 --> 14:57.875
Well, you didn't seem too broken
up about it, Kevin.

14:57.959 --> 14:59.083
Why should I care?

15:02.625 --> 15:04.250
She left me, okay?

15:07.417 --> 15:09.000
Alrighty there, Dr. Leverage.

15:09.083 --> 15:12.375
Listen up, because here's
the real inside scoop.

15:12.458 --> 15:15.375
I could literally sculpt
a gigantic Mr. Burnett

15:15.458 --> 15:18.417
out of what I just removed
from Mr. Burnett,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.834
so I really think
it's in your best interest

15:20.917 --> 15:21.917
for you to start talking.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.458
Should I get the child
a baseball glove or a tutu?

15:24.917 --> 15:27.083
Yeah, well, girls can play
baseball too.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.083
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What girls can do.

15:29.166 --> 15:31.583
You've come a long way, baby.
Spill, doll.

15:32.208 --> 15:34.041
Look, I really think that you
should think about this,

15:34.125 --> 15:35.208
so I wrote it down,

15:35.291 --> 15:36.875
and I put it in an envelope,

15:36.959 --> 15:38.959
and then I gave it to her.

15:40.542 --> 15:41.542
Hi, honey.

15:43.166 --> 15:45.417
Oh, you are just
so gonna pay for this.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.375
Yeah, well, uh,
so are you.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.792
-Bend over, baby. (laughing)
-Oh.

15:53.250 --> 15:56.208
(heart monitor beeping)

15:57.625 --> 16:00.083
I think Mr. Singer's
gonna be just fine.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.667
Oh, jeez, Bob,

16:01.750 --> 16:03.333
don't creep up on me like that,

16:03.417 --> 16:05.375
I almost dropped some fruit
in my looms.

16:05.458 --> 16:06.542
(laughing)

16:06.625 --> 16:07.959
I'm sorry, buddy.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.709
Say, listen, uh,

16:09.792 --> 16:12.792
nowadays it has become
kinda hospital protocol

16:12.875 --> 16:14.917
to do a modified Seldinger
in a case like this.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.333
You do know how to do
one of those, don't ya?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.458
-Course.
-Good.

16:19.542 --> 16:21.875
Because the patient
in bed number two needs one.

16:22.709 --> 16:24.125
You mind doing it for me?

16:25.667 --> 16:27.250
What the hell's this all about?

16:27.333 --> 16:28.291
Nothing.

16:28.667 --> 16:32.417
I was, uh, just looking over
your files, and, um,

16:32.959 --> 16:34.125
well...

16:34.208 --> 16:37.500
Your osteoporotic patients
aren't on bisphosphonate,

16:37.583 --> 16:40.166
your diabetics aren't on ace
inhibitors.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.792
Doug, a lot of your treatments
are pretty out of date.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.291
Come on, Bob. I mean...

16:46.667 --> 16:48.917
guys like us,
we're set in our ways.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.417
Well, this is not
an age thing, Doug.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.000
Hell, these days, if you
been out of med school five years,

16:54.083 --> 16:56.250
half of what you learned
is obsolete.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.709
Why do you think
I spend every other weekend

16:58.750 --> 17:01.166
at a seminar in some
two-star hotel ballroom

17:01.250 --> 17:03.959
that still stinks
of last night's prom vomit?

17:04.417 --> 17:07.166
I do it because
I have to keep up.

17:07.250 --> 17:10.250
Also, it give you two days away
from the missus, right?

17:10.625 --> 17:11.792
Once again, I am sorry

17:11.875 --> 17:13.875
I was the one who introduced ya
in the first place.

17:13.959 --> 17:17.542
(laughing)

17:19.583 --> 17:21.000
Look, Bob, I just--

17:22.125 --> 17:24.583
I don't have the energy
for all that stuff.

17:25.417 --> 17:26.417
Well...

17:28.250 --> 17:29.709
Then we got a problem.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.667
So, you wanna talk
about what happened?

17:36.709 --> 17:39.083
Nah, man, look,
it's just too depressing.

17:39.166 --> 17:40.750
Kevin, you're in
a bad place right now,

17:40.834 --> 17:42.917
but you're gonna get through it.
You just gotta give it time.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.583
Yeah, well, what am I supposed
to do until then?

17:46.250 --> 17:48.709
Barkeep, I'm gonna
need these two glasses

17:48.792 --> 17:50.500
and that bottle of whiskey.

17:50.583 --> 17:51.750
Excuse me, miss,

17:51.834 --> 17:54.083
my brother definitely
needs to borrow your hat,

17:54.166 --> 17:56.667
and for the love
of all that is holy,

17:56.750 --> 17:59.041
will somebody please
put on some country?!

18:05.417 --> 18:07.000
We are a horrible couple.

18:07.083 --> 18:08.542
You couldn't be more wrong...

18:09.250 --> 18:11.667
because even though
that isn't my kid in there,

18:11.750 --> 18:14.458
I still wanna feel connected,

18:14.542 --> 18:17.417
and I just thought I'd be more
hooked in if I knew.

18:18.208 --> 18:19.208
It's funny.

18:19.291 --> 18:21.458
Every time I think
you're the same old,

18:21.542 --> 18:23.750
sharp-edged... jackass,

18:23.834 --> 18:25.917
you turn around and do something
to remind me

18:25.959 --> 18:28.375
that you're such a pansy.

18:28.458 --> 18:29.792
Oh.

18:29.875 --> 18:30.917
Listen...

18:31.750 --> 18:34.500
I was really hoping
that the two of us

18:34.583 --> 18:36.750
could find out
when the baby comes...

18:37.375 --> 18:39.458
but if you really
need to know now,

18:39.542 --> 18:41.208
just keep it to yourself.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.041
Yeah, run away there, missy,

18:44.125 --> 18:46.625
'cause guilt trips don't work
on old Pareno.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.000
Huh?

18:48.583 --> 18:49.667
(light whimper)

18:56.875 --> 18:59.375
Sport, if you're still standing
there when I turn around,

18:59.458 --> 19:01.458
I'm gonna have them erase
your name too.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.500
Good night, sir.

19:05.792 --> 19:07.625
(J.D.) <i>It's not always easy to</i>

19:09.667 --> 19:12.959

My brother!

19:32.208 --> 19:34.709

19:34.792 --> 19:37.041
You think it's my fault
he got fired, don't you?

19:37.667 --> 19:38.834
Why would you say that?

19:38.917 --> 19:40.333
No reason.

19:40.417 --> 19:44.542
(Troy) Let's see ya drive home
now, Mr. Doctor-man.

19:44.625 --> 19:47.000
(insane laughter)

19:47.083 --> 19:48.166
Troy...

19:48.834 --> 19:51.458
I said just stand there.
Didn't I?

19:52.375 --> 19:53.500
Yeah.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.417
I may have to get rid
of the guy.

20:09.250 --> 20:12.250
Oh, oh, she, uh--
she not with him...

20:12.333 --> 20:15.166
and she ain't with me,
she's with Rowdy.

20:15.250 --> 20:16.583
