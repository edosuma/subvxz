WEBVTT

00:16.900 --> 00:19.200
( <i>bell ringing )</i>

00:23.740 --> 00:26.010
( <i>whistle blowing )</i>

00:39.220 --> 00:43.590
( <i>playing the blues )</i>

00:59.540 --> 01:04.450
( <i>honking horn )</i>

01:04.510 --> 01:05.710
D-ohh!

01:05.780 --> 01:06.710
Ahh!!

01:21.660 --> 01:23.230
Uh... Chief Wiggum,
Archbishop McGee

01:23.300 --> 01:24.270
distinguished guests

01:24.330 --> 01:25.570
I am pleased to dedicate

01:25.630 --> 01:27.570
this emergency warning system.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.860
In the off-chance
of a nuclear disaster

01:30.940 --> 01:33.780
this sign will tell you,
the good citizens of Springfield

01:33.840 --> 01:35.310
what to do.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.560
Homer:
The joke's on them.

01:48.620 --> 01:49.760
If the core explodes

01:49.820 --> 01:55.200
there won't be any power
to light that sign.

01:55.260 --> 01:59.330
And now, I would like
to present the man who made
this sign possible

01:59.400 --> 02:02.870
by dropping the last of his
obstructionist legal challenges.

02:02.940 --> 02:04.610
Montgomery Burns.

02:07.370 --> 02:09.300
Mr. Burns is never late.

02:09.380 --> 02:10.810
Something must be
terribly wrong.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.110
There better be.

02:12.180 --> 02:14.820
Nobody leaves Diamond Joe
Quimby holding the bag.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.990
( <i>gasping: )
Must... turn... over.</i>

02:18.050 --> 02:19.350
Got... to...

02:19.420 --> 02:20.790
greet... dignitaries.

02:20.850 --> 02:21.980
Oh, no!

02:22.050 --> 02:25.080
Mr. Burns! We've got
to get a doctor.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.160
Absolutely not.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.430
No quack sawbones

02:27.490 --> 02:30.620
is going to apply
his leeches to me

02:30.700 --> 02:33.770
as long as there's
an ounce of strength

02:33.830 --> 02:35.590
left in me....

02:35.670 --> 02:37.370
Mmm.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.240
Mr. Burns is suffering

02:39.300 --> 02:42.700
from what we medical men
call hypohemia.

02:42.780 --> 02:44.550
In laymen's terms,
it's quite simply
a lack of blood.

02:44.610 --> 02:47.220
Damn it, doctor, I'm no idiot.
I know what hypohemia is.

02:47.280 --> 02:48.820
What I want to know is
what can we do about it?

02:48.880 --> 02:52.050
At this point,
our only hope is
a transfusion.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.590
How long does it take
to sterilize a needle?

02:53.650 --> 02:55.050
A few seconds.
Oh, skip it!

02:55.120 --> 02:56.860
Just leave me enough
to get home.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.780
( <i>chuckling: )
I'm afraid it's not that simple.</i>

02:59.860 --> 03:02.760
His blood type
is double-o-negative.

03:02.830 --> 03:03.930
It's quite rare.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.230
But I'm b-positive.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.000
Damn my common gutter-blood
in my veins.

03:07.070 --> 03:09.270
Smithers, don't feel so bad.

03:09.330 --> 03:12.600
After all, the kidney
you donated to me

03:12.670 --> 03:14.480
really hit the spot.

03:14.540 --> 03:18.310
Smithers:
Attention all employees!

03:18.380 --> 03:20.720
Our boss and inspiration,
Mr. Burns

03:20.780 --> 03:23.350
( <i>choking: )
is at death's... death's door.</i>

03:23.420 --> 03:26.550
If you have type
double-o-negative blood

03:26.620 --> 03:29.490
I implore you to report
to the Bloodmobile outside.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.790
That is all.

03:30.860 --> 03:32.460
I'd give him my blood
except for one thing.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.480
What's that?

03:33.560 --> 03:35.930
I don't want to.

03:35.990 --> 03:37.790
I can't believe you guys.

03:37.860 --> 03:40.960
There's a human being out there
with millions of dollars

03:41.030 --> 03:42.360
who needs our help

03:42.430 --> 03:44.100
and you don't want
to cash in?

03:44.170 --> 03:48.080
That's why you losers are stuck
in this crummy dead-end job.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.440
You know Homer,
I <i>am your supervisor.</i>

03:49.510 --> 03:50.450
Sorry, sir.

03:50.510 --> 03:51.550
Maggie, look.

03:51.610 --> 03:52.610
What's that?

03:52.680 --> 03:55.120
Lee-mur. Lee-mur.

03:55.180 --> 03:56.520
Zebu.

03:56.580 --> 03:58.450
Zeee-booo.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.460
What are you doing, honey?

04:00.520 --> 04:03.730
I'm trying to teach Maggie
that nature doesn't end
with the barnyard.

04:03.790 --> 04:05.890
I want her to have all the
advantages that I didn't have.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.330
Lisa, we did the best we could.

04:08.390 --> 04:09.620
What's a zebu?

04:09.700 --> 04:12.270
It's like an ox, only it has
a hump and a dewlap.

04:12.330 --> 04:14.100
Hump and dewlap.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.770
Hump and dewlap.

04:15.830 --> 04:16.760
Marge!

04:16.839 --> 04:17.769
What's my blood type?

04:17.839 --> 04:19.110
A-positive.

04:19.170 --> 04:21.610
Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood,
and I don't have it.

04:21.670 --> 04:23.470
You know his blood type?
How romantic.

04:23.540 --> 04:26.280
A mother knows everything
about her family.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.220
Oh yeah?
What's my shoe size?

04:27.280 --> 04:28.220
Four-b.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.220
How many teeth do I have?

04:29.280 --> 04:30.220
16 permanent, eight baby.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.290
Earmuffs?

04:31.350 --> 04:32.450
- XL.
- Ring?

04:32.520 --> 04:33.520
I don't want you wearing rings,

04:33.590 --> 04:34.960
it looks cheap, but three.

04:35.020 --> 04:36.120
Allergies?

04:36.190 --> 04:37.330
Butterscotch and
imitation butterscotch...

04:37.390 --> 04:38.430
And..?

04:38.490 --> 04:39.590
Glow-in-the-dark
monster makeup.

04:39.660 --> 04:40.760
Ooh, impressive.

04:40.830 --> 04:42.900
How many hairs on my head?
Without looking.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.930
Oh Homey, you have
lots of hair.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.040
Why did you want to know
your blood type?

04:47.100 --> 04:49.740
Old man Burns is gonna
kick off if he doesn't get some

04:49.800 --> 04:50.710
double-o-negative blood,

04:50.770 --> 04:52.570
but nobody at the plant has it.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.610
Bart does.

04:53.670 --> 04:55.340
Whoa! Yes! All right! Whoo!

04:55.410 --> 04:56.840
Congratulations, boy!

04:56.910 --> 04:58.950
You've got a date
with a needle.

04:59.010 --> 05:00.010
Hey, wait a minute.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.750
I don't have
to give blood.

05:01.810 --> 05:02.910
I have rights, you know.

05:02.980 --> 05:04.950
Yeah, you have the right
to remain silent.

05:05.020 --> 05:07.020
Bart, you have to
help someone in need.

05:07.090 --> 05:09.120
It's the only
decent thing to do.

05:09.190 --> 05:10.190
D-ohhh!

05:10.260 --> 05:11.690
Homer:
Bart, it's not like

05:11.760 --> 05:14.630
I'm asking you
to give blood for free.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.450
That would be crazy.
You're a little young

05:16.530 --> 05:17.600
to understand this

05:17.660 --> 05:19.920
but when you save
a rich man's life

05:20.000 --> 05:21.770
he showers you with riches!

05:21.830 --> 05:24.060
Don't you know the story
of Hercules and the lion?

05:24.140 --> 05:25.070
Is it a Bible story?

05:25.140 --> 05:26.110
Yeah probably.

05:26.170 --> 05:28.080
Anyway, once upon a time

05:28.140 --> 05:32.710
there was a big, mean lion
who got a thorn in his paw

05:32.780 --> 05:35.850
and all the village people
tried to pull it out

05:35.910 --> 05:37.940
but nobody was strong enough.

05:38.020 --> 05:39.520
So, they got Hercules

05:39.590 --> 05:41.920
and Hercules used
his mighty strength

05:41.990 --> 05:43.190
and bingo!

05:43.260 --> 05:46.560
Anyway, the moral is
the lion was so happy

05:46.630 --> 05:49.830
he gave Hercules
this big thing of riches.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.630
How did a lion get rich?

05:51.700 --> 05:52.800
It was the olden days.

05:52.860 --> 05:53.720
Oh.

05:55.830 --> 05:57.300
Hey! Let's go!

05:57.370 --> 05:59.840
Emergency! Life or death here!

05:59.910 --> 06:01.140
Just a sec, man.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.380
Whoa, Otto, man.

06:02.440 --> 06:03.780
You work here?

06:03.840 --> 06:05.800
Oh Yeah. During the day,
all my friends are in school

06:05.880 --> 06:08.650
so I got a job as a certified
bloodletting tech dude.

06:08.710 --> 06:10.110
Now let's get this
show on the road.

06:10.180 --> 06:11.150
Okay.

06:11.220 --> 06:12.850
Let me wash up.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.790
( <i>humming "Iron Man"
by Black Sabbath )</i>

06:15.850 --> 06:18.250
Homer, brave young Bart...

06:18.320 --> 06:20.850
I don't know
which one to hug first.

06:20.930 --> 06:21.960
Uh, the boy.

06:22.030 --> 06:23.130
Eww.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.000
( <i>tires screeching )</i>

06:28.500 --> 06:30.300
( <i>humming )</i>

06:33.240 --> 06:34.280
Oop!

06:36.780 --> 06:39.050
We're ready with
the transfusion.

06:39.110 --> 06:41.720
Smithers, I'm not going
to make it.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.220
I want to dictate...

06:43.280 --> 06:44.790
my epitaph.

06:44.850 --> 06:45.990
Go ahead.

06:46.050 --> 06:48.290
Charles Montgomery Burns...

06:48.350 --> 06:49.280
Mm-hmm.

06:49.350 --> 06:50.620
American...

06:50.690 --> 06:51.930
Mm-hmm.

06:51.990 --> 06:54.060
And patriot American...

06:54.130 --> 06:55.230
Patriot...

06:57.600 --> 06:59.170
Master of the atom...

07:01.130 --> 07:02.790
Scourge of a despot.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.670
Oh, tyrant, hear his mighty name

07:07.740 --> 07:08.680
and quake!

07:08.740 --> 07:09.680
Smithers!

07:09.740 --> 07:11.080
I'm back!

07:11.140 --> 07:13.100
Burns:
Top of the morning to you.

07:13.180 --> 07:14.850
Why, look who's here.

07:14.910 --> 07:17.240
It's... good old... you.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.750
Hi, Mr. Burns.

07:18.820 --> 07:21.490
Oh! Hey, there, mister...

07:21.550 --> 07:22.880
brownshoes.

07:22.950 --> 07:25.180
How about
that local sports team?

07:25.260 --> 07:27.430
Mr. Burns-- he's okay.

07:27.490 --> 07:28.450
Jackpot!

07:28.530 --> 07:29.330
( <i>glass breaking )</i>

07:32.530 --> 07:34.500
<i>Ay caramba!</i>

07:34.570 --> 07:36.470
Well, that's game.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.810
<i>Hasta mañana, Oswaldo.</i>

07:38.870 --> 07:41.080
Smithers, I'm back in the pink--

07:41.140 --> 07:42.940
full of pith and vinegar.

07:43.010 --> 07:44.480
Just remarkable, sir.

07:44.540 --> 07:46.770
You know, it's funny, Smithers.

07:46.850 --> 07:50.050
I tried every tincture
and poultice and tonic

07:50.120 --> 07:52.190
and patent medicine there is

07:52.250 --> 07:53.990
and all I really needed was

07:54.050 --> 07:56.010
the blood of a young boy.

07:56.090 --> 07:57.790
What was the lad's name?

07:57.860 --> 07:58.860
Bart Simpson, sir.

07:58.920 --> 07:59.950
Who?

08:00.030 --> 08:01.560
He's the son of
Homer Simpson--

08:01.630 --> 08:02.630
one of your stiff's
in sector 7-G.

08:02.690 --> 08:05.090
Well, the Simpsons
will be getting

08:05.160 --> 08:07.830
a very nice surprise
in the mail.

08:07.900 --> 08:10.610
Very nice, indeed.
( <i>fiendish laugh )</i>

08:10.670 --> 08:12.470
Bill, bill...

08:12.540 --> 08:14.310
summons, bill...

08:14.370 --> 08:15.230
( <i>gasps )</i>

08:15.310 --> 08:16.280
Wait a minute.

08:16.340 --> 08:17.410
From C.M. Burns.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.450
This is it.

08:18.510 --> 08:20.150
Yes, this is it!

08:20.210 --> 08:21.350
Woo-hoo! Whoo!

08:21.410 --> 08:22.770
Bart, Lisa, Maggie!

08:22.850 --> 08:25.920
Let's do this out in the yard
where the neighbors can see.

08:25.980 --> 08:27.350
Lisa, dim the lights.

08:27.420 --> 08:28.220
No!
turn on more lights.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.260
Do something.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.660
Yes, Dad.

08:32.490 --> 08:34.600
It's a little thin
but that's okay.

08:34.659 --> 08:36.100
It could be a check.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.400
Alright, there's no check.

08:38.460 --> 08:39.490
Just a card,
but don't panic.

08:39.559 --> 08:42.289
I'm sure it tells us
what we're getting

08:42.370 --> 08:44.410
and where we can pick it up.

08:44.470 --> 08:47.440
"Dear Bart,
Thank you kindly for the blood.

08:47.510 --> 08:50.280
Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."

08:50.340 --> 08:51.280
D-ohhh!

08:51.340 --> 08:52.870
It's just a card!

08:55.880 --> 08:58.950
Is that some way
to show your gratitude?

08:59.020 --> 09:01.490
No gold, no diamonds,
no jewelry...

09:01.550 --> 09:03.250
not even a lousy card.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.060
Wait. There was a card.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.050
That's what got me so mad
in the first place!

09:07.130 --> 09:09.760
You don't do things like that
to be rewarded.

09:09.830 --> 09:12.600
You do them because
a fellow human being
needs a helping hand.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.890
Marge, you're my wife
and I love you very much

09:14.970 --> 09:17.740
but you're living
in a world of make-believe

09:17.800 --> 09:20.230
with flowers and bells
and leprechauns

09:20.310 --> 09:22.440
and magic frogs
with funny little hats.

09:22.510 --> 09:23.440
Yeah, Mom, we got hosed.

09:23.510 --> 09:24.450
Bart!

09:24.510 --> 09:25.550
We got exactly

09:25.610 --> 09:27.180
what we wanted
out of this!

09:27.250 --> 09:29.850
We gave an old man
a second chance.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.320
I promised my boy
one simple thing:

09:32.380 --> 09:34.150
lots of riches

09:34.220 --> 09:36.560
and that man broke my promise.

09:36.620 --> 09:37.560
Well I've had it!

09:37.620 --> 09:38.950
Bart, take a letter!

09:39.020 --> 09:41.120
Dear Mr. Burns

09:41.190 --> 09:45.660
I'm so glad
you enjoyed my son's blood

09:45.730 --> 09:49.070
and your card was just great.

09:49.130 --> 09:52.660
In case you can't tell,
I'm being sarcastic.

09:52.740 --> 09:54.410
You stink!

09:54.470 --> 09:56.670
Could you read that
last part back to me?

09:56.740 --> 09:58.350
"You stink!"

09:58.410 --> 09:59.750
Good.

09:59.810 --> 10:03.350
You are a senile,
buck-toothed old mummy

10:03.420 --> 10:06.720
with bony girl arms
and you smell like...

10:06.790 --> 10:08.260
An elephant's butt?

10:08.320 --> 10:09.360
( <i>laughs )</i>

10:09.420 --> 10:11.360
An elephant's butt.

10:11.420 --> 10:13.880
But he's your boss.
Do you have to mail it
right this minute?

10:13.960 --> 10:15.500
Yup.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.670
You're still angry, Homer.
Why don't you sleep on it?

10:17.730 --> 10:19.070
Forget it, Marge.

10:19.130 --> 10:21.300
Please, Homey?

10:21.370 --> 10:23.000
For me?

10:25.440 --> 10:27.510
Oh, all right.

10:27.570 --> 10:30.100
You always do
that hand thing

10:30.180 --> 10:32.750
and it usually works.

10:32.810 --> 10:34.720
Cheap son of a...

10:34.780 --> 10:36.250
( <i>snoring )</i>

10:43.660 --> 10:46.430
<i>Ooh, pancakes.</i>

10:46.490 --> 10:48.860
<i>Ooh.</i>

10:48.930 --> 10:51.670
Homer, breakfast is ready.

10:51.730 --> 10:52.930
Hmm?

10:53.000 --> 10:53.970
( <i>gags )</i>

10:54.030 --> 10:55.300
Marge, you saved me

10:55.370 --> 10:57.100
from making a big mistake.

10:57.170 --> 10:58.540
I finally understand

10:58.600 --> 11:00.100
the meaning of...

11:00.170 --> 11:01.510
( <i>unintelligible )</i>

11:01.570 --> 11:02.630
Meaning of what?

11:02.710 --> 11:03.840
Better half, Marge.
Better half.

11:03.910 --> 11:04.850
Oh, thank you.

11:04.910 --> 11:06.180
Where's the letter?

11:06.240 --> 11:07.710
( <i>whistling )</i>

11:13.770 --> 11:15.010
Where is it?!

11:15.070 --> 11:16.470
Oh...

11:16.540 --> 11:20.110
Homer, I don't think it's
in the cornstarch canister.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.650
Well, it's somewhere.

11:21.710 --> 11:24.080
It didn't just get up
and walk away.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.020
Bart, have you
seen the letter?

11:26.080 --> 11:27.420
Yep.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.680
All right,
think very carefully.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.020
Where did you see it last?

11:32.090 --> 11:34.020
The last place I saw it...

11:34.090 --> 11:35.060
Uh-huh?

11:35.120 --> 11:36.520
Was in my hand...

11:36.590 --> 11:37.560
Yeah?

11:37.630 --> 11:39.800
As I was shoving it

11:39.860 --> 11:41.730
into the mailbox.

11:41.800 --> 11:42.900
Homer:
<i>Oh!</i>

11:42.960 --> 11:45.290
Why did you do that?

11:45.370 --> 11:48.870
Dad, there were things
in the letter that had
to be said

11:48.940 --> 11:52.140
and I know you.
You're an emotional guy.

11:52.210 --> 11:54.080
Just because you were mad
last night

11:54.140 --> 11:55.640
is no guarantee
you'd be mad in the morning.

11:55.710 --> 11:58.320
I'll show you mad
in the morning!

11:58.380 --> 12:00.380
Homer, you encouraged him.

12:00.450 --> 12:02.520
You should be strangling
yourself.

12:02.580 --> 12:06.510
She's right.

12:06.590 --> 12:07.490
Okay, think, Homer.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.590
Don't panic.

12:08.660 --> 12:09.930
They don't pick up the mail
till noon.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.230
There's still time!

12:11.290 --> 12:12.750
Ow, ow.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.100
Ow, ow.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.190
Ow, ow.

12:15.260 --> 12:16.490
Give it up, Homer.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.830
It's locked up tight.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.240
Locked, eh?

12:19.300 --> 12:22.070
Well, I just might
have a little surprise

12:22.140 --> 12:24.610
up my sleeve
for old Mr. Lock.

12:24.670 --> 12:27.030
Step aside, boy.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.320
Hey!

12:32.380 --> 12:34.020
I'm with you, Homer.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.820
Fight the power!

12:38.820 --> 12:40.560
Why the hose, Homer?

12:40.620 --> 12:43.460
What does it look like?
I'll get our letter so wet,
the ink will run

12:43.530 --> 12:46.200
and no one will be
able to read it.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.630
Yeah, but don't other people
have mail in there?

12:47.700 --> 12:50.330
So a few people
won't get a few letters.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.570
Boo-hoo.

12:51.630 --> 12:54.200
You know the kind of letters
people write:

12:54.270 --> 12:55.440
"Dear somebody
you never heard of--

12:55.500 --> 12:57.100
"How is so and so?

12:57.170 --> 12:58.140
"Blah, blah, blah.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.240
Yours truly, some bozo."

12:59.310 --> 13:00.480
Big loss.

13:00.540 --> 13:03.880
Now Bart, you keep an eye out
for the mailman.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.280
Just give me some kinda signal.

13:05.350 --> 13:06.250
Dad, the mailman's here.

13:06.310 --> 13:07.780
That's a good one.

13:07.850 --> 13:09.450
No, I mean
the mailman's here!

13:09.520 --> 13:10.490
( <i>screams )</i>

13:10.550 --> 13:11.590
Dear God!
Are you planning

13:11.650 --> 13:12.980
to water the mail?

13:13.050 --> 13:16.050
I guess it wouldn't do
any good to run

13:16.120 --> 13:18.190
'cause you're a mail lady and
you know my name and address
and everything, huh?

13:18.260 --> 13:19.260
That's right.

13:19.330 --> 13:20.460
Well, I'm still
going to run!

13:22.260 --> 13:24.930
I want the whole world
to hear the story

13:25.000 --> 13:27.670
of my harrowing struggle
with hypohemia.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.840
Mr. Roman is one of the finest
ghostwriters in the business.

13:30.910 --> 13:34.010
He's written <i>Like Hell I Can't,
Up From the Muck</i>

13:34.080 --> 13:35.780
<i>The Unsinkable
Sadruodin Mahbaradad.</i>

13:35.840 --> 13:37.170
Excellent.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.250
All right,
first question:

13:39.310 --> 13:41.740
have you slept
with anyone famous?

13:41.820 --> 13:43.790
Well, Countess Von Zeppelin
and I...

13:43.850 --> 13:45.220
What in blaze..!

13:45.290 --> 13:48.490
Now you listen to me,
you bargain-basement Baudelaire

13:48.560 --> 13:50.390
I'm not some dizzy starlet

13:50.460 --> 13:52.630
who can't string
two words together.

13:52.690 --> 13:54.320
I can write this myself!

13:54.400 --> 13:55.830
You're fired!

14:00.870 --> 14:02.670
( <i>imitating Mr. Burns: )
Hello.</i>

14:02.740 --> 14:04.740
My name is Mr. Burns.

14:04.810 --> 14:06.940
I believe you
have a letter for me.

14:07.010 --> 14:10.350
Okay, Mr. Burns,
what's your first name?

14:10.410 --> 14:11.580
I don't know.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.750
Great plan, Bart.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.350
Ooh, look, Maggie.

14:16.420 --> 14:17.990
What is that?

14:18.050 --> 14:22.080
Dodecahedron. Dodecahedron.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.230
Lisa, I don't know
what you're doing

14:24.290 --> 14:25.420
but it's very strange

14:25.490 --> 14:26.950
and your father's
trying to worry.

14:27.030 --> 14:28.870
Burns:
<i>Chapter the fifth--</i>

14:28.930 --> 14:33.300
<i>the trip to the infirmary
with most unexpected results.</i>

14:36.400 --> 14:40.430
Homer:
<i>Oops. 28 minutes
till Burns comes in.</i>

14:40.510 --> 14:42.910
<i>Time for operation "Mail Take."</i>

14:48.550 --> 14:49.920
Can I help you?
( <i>shrieks )</i>

14:49.980 --> 14:51.610
Oh don't be frightened
of this.

14:51.690 --> 14:52.860
It's nothing
but a letter opener.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.120
Who are you?

14:54.190 --> 14:55.330
<i>Don't tell him.
Give him a fake name.</i>

14:55.390 --> 14:56.390
Homer Simpson.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.330
<i>D-ohhh!</i>

14:57.390 --> 14:58.730
Simpson, huh?

14:58.790 --> 15:01.020
Simpson, why there's
a letter here from you.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.230
I'll just read it right now.

15:03.300 --> 15:07.170
"Dear Mr. Burns, I'm so glad
you enjoyed my son's blood

15:07.240 --> 15:09.910
and your card was just great."

15:09.970 --> 15:14.550
Why, Simpson,
you've made my day.

15:14.610 --> 15:16.580
You're a true gentleman.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.340
Well, I'll be on my...

15:18.410 --> 15:19.740
Hello, there's more.

15:19.810 --> 15:24.010
"In case you can't tell,
I'm being sarcastic.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.520
"You stink.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.160
"You are a senile

15:27.220 --> 15:28.790
"buck-toothed old mummy

15:28.860 --> 15:30.230
"with bony girl arms

15:30.290 --> 15:32.700
and you smell
like an elephant's butt"!

15:34.100 --> 15:37.300
Come on, Joey,
you have to twist my arm?

15:37.370 --> 15:38.270
Homer, I don't tell you how

15:38.330 --> 15:39.760
to do your job, okay?

15:39.830 --> 15:44.430
I could crush him like an ant,
but it would be too easy.

15:44.510 --> 15:47.640
No, revenge is a dish
best served cold.

15:47.710 --> 15:49.980
I'll bide my time until...

15:50.040 --> 15:51.640
Oh, what the hell.

15:51.710 --> 15:53.940
I'll just crush him like an ant.

15:58.440 --> 15:59.370
Senile, eh?

15:59.440 --> 16:00.840
Buck-toothed, am I?

16:00.910 --> 16:04.110
Bony arms, are they?
Liver spots, did I?

16:04.180 --> 16:05.350
Send this, will you?

16:05.410 --> 16:07.010
This pink slip
awaits your signature, sir.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.080
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

16:09.150 --> 16:11.020
Now that's odd.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.010
I've just robbed a man
of his livelihood

16:14.090 --> 16:16.260
and yet I feel
strangely empty.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.530
Tell you what, Smithers,
have him beaten to a pulp.

16:18.590 --> 16:19.530
But, sir...

16:19.590 --> 16:20.530
But what?!

16:20.590 --> 16:21.860
Nothing, sir.

16:21.930 --> 16:24.360
I've never seen Mr. Burns
this mad

16:24.430 --> 16:25.700
and he's always

16:25.760 --> 16:26.890
kind of mad.

16:26.970 --> 16:29.900
Me and my big
letter-writing pen.

16:29.970 --> 16:31.540
Honey, what's done is done.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.830
No matter what happens

16:32.900 --> 16:33.930
we'll pull through.

16:34.010 --> 16:35.110
We always do.

16:35.170 --> 16:36.200
Okay, here's the plan.

16:36.270 --> 16:37.630
You can move in
with your sisters

16:37.710 --> 16:38.710
and raise the kids,

16:38.780 --> 16:40.780
and I'll die in a gutter.

16:40.850 --> 16:43.380
It's practical
and within our means.

16:43.450 --> 16:45.220
They always told me

16:45.280 --> 16:47.340
I was going to destroy
the family

16:47.420 --> 16:49.060
but I never believed it.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.390
That's okay, Bart.

16:50.460 --> 16:51.790
Nobody really believed it.

16:51.860 --> 16:53.560
We were just trying
to scare you.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.390
You know Homer Simpson?

16:57.460 --> 16:58.570
Yeah, nice guy.

16:58.630 --> 17:00.030
Play poker with him
once in awhile.

17:00.100 --> 17:03.000
Mm-hmm.
We need him beaten up.

17:03.070 --> 17:04.540
You got it.
Wait.

17:04.599 --> 17:07.060
- What is it?
- Uh... nothing.

17:07.140 --> 17:08.079
Wait.

17:08.140 --> 17:09.140
What?

17:09.210 --> 17:11.280
Beat, but.. don't kick.

17:11.339 --> 17:12.599
Hold the kicks.

17:12.680 --> 17:13.609
Wait.

17:13.680 --> 17:14.619
What?!

17:14.680 --> 17:17.079
Um...

17:17.150 --> 17:18.420
What did Homey do,
anyway?

17:18.480 --> 17:23.810
( <i>sobbing: )
He saved Mr. Burns's life.</i>

17:23.890 --> 17:25.589
( <i>thunder rumbling )</i>

17:25.660 --> 17:28.730
In closing, gentle reader,
I'd like to thank you.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.490
What's that you say?

17:30.560 --> 17:31.830
Me thanking you?

17:31.900 --> 17:33.970
No, it's not a misprint.

17:34.030 --> 17:37.170
For you see,
I enjoyed writing this book

17:37.240 --> 17:39.670
as much as you
enjoyed reading it.

17:39.740 --> 17:41.110
The End.

17:42.340 --> 17:44.950
Ah, Smithers,
how did the beating go?

17:45.010 --> 17:46.750
Sir, there was no beating.

17:46.810 --> 17:48.950
What?
Well that's a hell
of a thing.

17:49.010 --> 17:50.910
- Why?
- Because I... I called it off.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.450
Judas!

17:52.520 --> 17:55.290
I'm sorry, sir but I just
couldn't hurt Homer Simpson.

17:55.350 --> 17:56.250
He saved your life.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.290
I see.

17:57.360 --> 17:58.890
I know you're mad at me

17:58.960 --> 18:00.290
but I think it's only fair to
warn you

18:00.360 --> 18:02.560
I'm going to stand outside
the gate until you forgive me.

18:02.630 --> 18:03.960
No need, Smithers.

18:04.030 --> 18:06.900
As usual, you've been
the sober ying

18:06.960 --> 18:09.760
to my raging yang.

18:09.830 --> 18:11.160
Put her there, old pal.

18:14.340 --> 18:17.950
( <i>sniffling: )
Sir, while I wish
this handshake would never end</i>

18:18.010 --> 18:21.380
I'm afraid we still have
the Simpson matter to attend to.

18:21.450 --> 18:23.320
We do indeed,
old friend.

18:23.380 --> 18:26.250
We do indeed.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.420
Moe's Tavern,
where the elite meet to drink.

18:29.490 --> 18:30.660
Bart:
Hello, is Mike there?

18:30.720 --> 18:31.860
Last name Rotch.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.020
Hold on, I'll check.

18:33.090 --> 18:34.290
Mike Rotch!

18:34.360 --> 18:35.600
Mike Rotch?!

18:35.660 --> 18:37.630
Has anybody seen
Mike Rotch lately?

18:37.700 --> 18:39.030
( <i>laughing )</i>

18:39.100 --> 18:41.370
Listen to me, you little puke.

18:41.430 --> 18:43.560
One of these days
I'm going to catch you

18:43.630 --> 18:45.630
and carve my name on your back
with an ice pick!

18:48.570 --> 18:50.270
What's the matter, Homer?

18:50.340 --> 18:52.110
You're not
your normal effervescent self.

18:52.180 --> 18:53.350
I've got my problems, Moe.

18:53.410 --> 18:54.650
Give me another one.

18:54.710 --> 18:57.640
You should not drink
to forget your problems.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.590
Yeah, you should always drink
to enhance your social skills.

19:00.650 --> 19:02.090
( <i>burping )</i>

19:02.150 --> 19:04.050
Burns:
<i>We'll get the Simpsons
a present--</i>

19:04.120 --> 19:05.860
an extravagant present.

19:05.920 --> 19:09.320
A mad, unthinkable,
utterly impossible present.

19:09.390 --> 19:12.960
A frabulous, grabulous,
zip-zoop zabulous present.

19:13.030 --> 19:15.040
Too practical.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.470
Too cutesie-poo.

19:20.740 --> 19:23.680
Too cornball.

19:23.740 --> 19:26.450
<i>A pool table?
Are you mad?</i>

19:26.510 --> 19:28.720
I'm not going to turn
his home into a saloon.

19:28.780 --> 19:30.350
Eureka!

19:30.420 --> 19:31.490
We've found it.

19:31.550 --> 19:33.350
But, sir, it's $32,000.

19:33.420 --> 19:37.590
Don't you dare sully this moment
with your price taggery.

19:37.660 --> 19:38.930
It's perfect.

19:38.990 --> 19:41.190
Oh, woe is me.

19:41.260 --> 19:44.600
Oh, my, it's Mr. Burns.

19:44.660 --> 19:46.020
( <i>yelps )</i>

19:46.100 --> 19:47.830
<i>Heave-ho,
heave-ho.</i>

19:47.900 --> 19:48.870
Heave-ho.

19:48.930 --> 19:50.530
Wait Dad, he's smiling.

19:51.670 --> 19:55.110
Mr. Burns,
you brought us a present.

19:55.170 --> 19:57.370
What did you think
I was going to do--

19:57.440 --> 19:58.380
have you beaten

19:58.440 --> 20:01.040
to a bloody pulp?

20:01.110 --> 20:02.880
To show there's no
hard feelings,

20:02.950 --> 20:04.450
Please take an
advance copy of my book.

20:07.420 --> 20:09.120
And now young fellow,
I haven't forgotten you.

20:09.190 --> 20:10.420
Here.

20:10.490 --> 20:11.860
Wow! A crowbar.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.890
It's to open the crate, stupid.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.400
What did I tell you?

20:16.460 --> 20:19.770
I bet it's filled with diamonds,
rubies, sapphires, pearls.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.000
Bart:
Wow!

20:24.070 --> 20:25.270
A big, ugly head.
D-oh!

20:25.340 --> 20:26.670
Actually, son

20:26.740 --> 20:29.480
it's a big, ugly,
Olmec Indian head.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.710
It was carved
by Mesoamerican Indians

20:31.780 --> 20:32.710
over 3,000 years ago.

20:32.780 --> 20:34.410
This gruesome customer

20:34.480 --> 20:36.980
is Ixtapolapoquetl--
the God of war.

20:37.050 --> 20:38.690
Awesome!

20:38.750 --> 20:40.620
No, Maggie, not Aztec.

20:40.690 --> 20:43.260
Olmec. Olmec.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.460
Marge, what does it do?

20:44.520 --> 20:45.960
It doesn't do anything.

20:46.020 --> 20:47.850
Really, what does it do?

20:47.930 --> 20:50.200
Whatever it does,
it's doing it now.

20:50.260 --> 20:55.340
I'll let you get acquainted
with Señor Ixtapolapoquetl.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.500
Did you see their faces,
Smithers?

20:57.570 --> 20:59.610
Sir, you're my God
of generosity.

20:59.670 --> 21:01.110
Homer:
<i>Save a guy's life</i>

21:01.170 --> 21:02.810
and what do you get?

21:02.870 --> 21:04.100
Nothing.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.450
Worse than nothing--

21:05.510 --> 21:06.910
Just a big, scary rock.

21:06.980 --> 21:08.980
Hey man, don't badmouth
the head.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.820
It's the thought that counts.

21:10.880 --> 21:11.990
The moral is:

21:12.050 --> 21:14.420
a good deed is
its own reward.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.120
Hey, we got a reward.

21:16.190 --> 21:17.960
The head is cool.

21:18.020 --> 21:21.620
Then I guess the moral is:
no good deed goes unrewarded.

21:21.690 --> 21:24.720
Wait a minute..
If I hadn't written
that nasty letter

21:24.800 --> 21:27.400
we wouldn't have
gotten anything.

21:27.470 --> 21:29.670
Well, then I guess the moral is:

21:29.730 --> 21:32.660
the squeaky wheel
gets the grease.

21:32.740 --> 21:34.780
Perhaps there is no
moral to this story.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.040
Exactly.

21:36.110 --> 21:38.280
It's just a bunch of stuff
that happened.

21:38.340 --> 21:41.170
But it certainly was
a memorable few days.

21:41.250 --> 21:42.580
Homer:
<i>Amen to that.</i>

21:42.650 --> 21:44.420
( <i>all laughing )</i>
