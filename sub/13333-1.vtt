WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:08.575 --> 00:12.112
Australia was one of the best times
of me entire life.

00:16.950 --> 00:20.487
I got stuck right in the bush
and I spent half me time down under.

00:22.088 --> 00:24.324
Australia was amazing.

00:24.391 --> 00:28.428
There was drinking.
There was everything. Watch out!

00:31.765 --> 00:36.836
More drunkenness, more vodka,
just more everything. Cheers.

00:36.903 --> 00:39.506
There was fights after fights
after arguments.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.044
You're a stupid prick.

00:45.111 --> 00:47.814
Vicky was tashing on
with everyone in sight.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.417
In a word, incredible. Come on!

00:50.483 --> 00:55.088
There was make-ups, break-ups, tears
What's gonna happen this time?

00:57.157 --> 00:59.526
Geordie Shore is back in Newcastle.

01:00.326 --> 01:01.995
Home sweet fucking home.

01:03.196 --> 01:04.730
We're back with a boom.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.637
We're gonna go fucking berserk.

01:12.071 --> 01:13.506
Get in.
(vomits)

01:16.409 --> 01:17.877
Game on.

01:17.944 --> 01:19.612
Then bang.

01:19.679 --> 01:21.948
She's a slut.
(shouting)

01:22.015 --> 01:25.418
We need a new bird who's single
and ready to mingle.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.921
I wouldn't want to be a new girl.

01:27.987 --> 01:31.291
She's younger, good crack
and she's got a wicked arse.

01:33.359 --> 01:37.530
More fights.
You stupid little scumbag!

01:39.265 --> 01:40.767
More banter...

01:45.572 --> 01:47.006
...more sex...

01:49.175 --> 01:51.110
...bring it on.
You shit yourself.

01:52.879 --> 01:55.482
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:55.548 --> 01:57.617
I'm a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:57.684 --> 01:59.919
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:59.986 --> 02:01.821
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:01.888 --> 02:03.957
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

02:04.023 --> 02:06.659
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.695
Hardest graft is doing me hair.

02:08.761 --> 02:10.964
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:12.599 --> 02:16.703
I'm back in Newcastle,
back in my home town and I'm single.

02:16.769 --> 02:18.538
How do you think it'll be?

02:18.605 --> 02:21.908
This is the first time
I've been single here for years.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.643
Geordie boys, watch out.

02:25.245 --> 02:28.748
Do you think you might meet
nice boys? I don't want any boy.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.817
I've got cock fright anyway.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.786
I've still got a slight touch
of cock fright.

02:33.853 --> 02:35.922
Have you had cock fright before?

02:35.989 --> 02:38.091
I brought it back from Australia.

02:38.157 --> 02:42.295
I don't believe you're asking
me this question. Scott's lovely.

02:42.362 --> 02:46.633
He's a lovely boy and great for one
night only. He irons, Holly.

02:48.334 --> 02:51.170
Off back in the fucking warzone.
Keep the house tidy.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.907
Wave then, you arsehole.

02:54.807 --> 02:59.012
Me and Gaz cleaned up in Australia
but the Geordies are in for a treat

02:59.078 --> 03:00.813
cos we're back in Newcastle.

03:00.880 --> 03:05.251
Everything is mint between me and
Kate. She's still the luckiest girl.

03:05.585 --> 03:07.520
I love you.
I love you too.

03:07.587 --> 03:10.823
There's only one scrawny
little problem and that's Gaz.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.726
We're not friends,
I don't wanna speak to him.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.528
Back in the mad house.

03:17.430 --> 03:20.333
Here we go son, see you again.
My granddad

03:20.400 --> 03:23.703
is a legend,
he always gives the best advice.

03:23.770 --> 03:27.040
He said don't leave it too late
to get into a relationship.

03:27.106 --> 03:30.209
Don't go looking for a girlfriend
with a walking stick!

03:30.276 --> 03:32.278
How you doing? Nice to see you.

03:32.345 --> 03:36.149
I hope Charlotte will be in a good
mood. She's got a boyfriend.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.718
(gasps) Oh, my God.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.019
Quick, Charlotte.

03:40.086 --> 03:43.056
Scrambled, Egg and Toast
were pissed off

03:43.122 --> 03:45.425
that I left them for so long
in Australia.

03:45.491 --> 03:49.262
Careful with the fish in me new car.
Ready to go.

03:49.329 --> 03:51.364
Me and Charlotte
have got boyfriends.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.667
I said once you get home,
you'll be in a relationship.

03:54.734 --> 03:59.205
And I'm not gonna let the Geordie
Shore house or Gary fuck it up.

04:00.473 --> 04:02.842
Are you OK?
Yep. You look amazing.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.345
Bye!
Bye, Dad!

04:07.513 --> 04:11.451
(squealing)
Let's just relax,

04:11.517 --> 04:15.154
have a laugh and if we get
a tash on, we get a tash on.

04:19.524 --> 04:21.226
Are you ready?
No.

04:24.731 --> 04:28.468
Hello! We're the first ones here.
We're home.

04:28.534 --> 04:31.771
This is the first time
I'm going into the house

04:31.838 --> 04:34.974
and I'm looking forward
to seeing everyone, even James.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.943
Shall we get a drink?
Yeah.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.879
You can have wine. No.
Vodka.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.748
Drinking before everyone else.

04:41.814 --> 04:44.183
You made that really strong.
No, it's not.

04:44.250 --> 04:48.187
Only problem is the only thing
to drink out of are mugs.

04:48.254 --> 04:51.891
What the fuck? Looks like we're
having a mother's meeting!

04:51.958 --> 04:55.928
Me and Holly go to the garden,
the shag pad's had a remodel.

04:55.995 --> 04:59.065
It's got little fairy lights on it.
In two days,

04:59.132 --> 05:01.167
that room is going to have
chlamydia.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.503
And it's just gonna get full of come.

05:03.569 --> 05:08.307
Massage in a bottle, state of ecstasy
or rapture, what's rapture?

05:08.374 --> 05:11.678
Rapture is when you're really
into something. Not rupture?

05:11.744 --> 05:12.812
No, that hurts.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.549
Oh, God, can you hear a car?
Yeah.

05:17.684 --> 05:21.554
Who do you think it is? Gary?
Could be someone new.

05:24.223 --> 05:25.892
Go on.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.627
Two voices.
Girl?

05:28.561 --> 05:31.664
Hello!
(laughter)

05:31.731 --> 05:33.700
What's going on?

05:33.766 --> 05:37.036
Gary and Scott walk in.
I'm looking at Scott thinking,

05:37.103 --> 05:40.673
"Would I go there again?
Is he giving me fizzy knickers?"

05:42.909 --> 05:47.547
I walk in, see Vicky and Holly.
Both half cut, drinks waiting.

05:47.613 --> 05:49.215
That's right, I'm home.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.084
Has anything changed?
Yeah.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.785
(laughs)
Executive shag pad.

05:52.852 --> 05:56.289
This the boys room?
Yeah, that's the boys' room now.

05:56.355 --> 06:00.059
There's actually eight beds.
There's one new person.

06:00.126 --> 06:02.929
We've worked out
there's four beds in the girls' room

06:02.995 --> 06:04.163
and four in the boys'.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.766
Even I know that four time four
equals eight.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.401
Who the fuck's the plus one?

06:08.468 --> 06:13.573
What will you do if it's a girl
and they come in and fancy James?

06:13.639 --> 06:18.544
(laughs) That's mint. He wouldn't
know how to handle it, so funny.

06:18.611 --> 06:21.681
Would you be more bothered
if she fancied James or Scott?

06:21.748 --> 06:25.818
It wouldn't be funny for her
if she fancied Scott.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.655
You've kinda got dibs.
Yeah, I've got dibs on him.

06:30.423 --> 06:35.628
I was in my house, me mam's talking
about me finding a boy and that.

06:35.695 --> 06:40.533
She was like, "I think Scott's dead
nice." I was like, "Mother." What?

06:40.600 --> 06:45.338
I thought I'd tell you, blow your
trumpet. You've already done that.

06:45.404 --> 06:49.942
This house holds so many memories,
it's time to make some new ones.

06:50.009 --> 06:54.447
I'm independent, strong and on me
own. Right, good. Join my crew.

06:54.514 --> 06:57.483
Not quite on your level.

06:57.550 --> 07:01.254
I'm an independent man.
No, you're not, you're a slag.

07:05.525 --> 07:09.862
I'm buzzing. I can't wait to see
everyone and get absolutely mortal.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.999
Hello. Oi-oi.
Hello, babe. Hello.

07:13.065 --> 07:15.268
Hi.
Hello, you all right?

07:15.334 --> 07:17.637
I thought it was gonna be awkward

07:17.703 --> 07:21.240
but shock, Gary's acting
like nothing's even happened.

07:22.241 --> 07:25.178
(horn sounds)
Woo-hoo, yeah!

07:25.244 --> 07:27.580
(shouting)

07:27.647 --> 07:29.582
Sophie and Charlotte.

07:29.649 --> 07:33.319
Suddenly we hear a load of noise
outside. It's Sophie and Charlotte.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.088
Where can we hide?
We decide to hide.

07:37.523 --> 07:41.360
(shouting)

07:41.427 --> 07:43.496
Charlotte's walking in with fish.

07:43.563 --> 07:47.967
I don't know which box smells worst,
the fish's or hers. (squeals)

07:48.034 --> 07:53.439
Cheers, everyone.
(cheering)

07:54.307 --> 07:56.609
We've got the whole squad
in Newcastle

07:56.676 --> 08:00.613
and we're gonna do what Geordies
do best, that's get fucking loose.

08:00.680 --> 08:01.881
Fuck.

08:03.416 --> 08:07.186
Aww. This is so cute.

08:07.253 --> 08:11.657
I'm really worried that I'm gonna
start to miss Mitch too much

08:11.724 --> 08:14.627
so I've brought something
to remind us of him.

08:14.694 --> 08:20.099
Close your eyes. Oh, my God.
This is sounds so interesting.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.101
Surprise!

08:22.168 --> 08:23.936
(laughs)

08:24.003 --> 08:27.540
What type of bunny boiler bell-end
gets a get a picture

08:27.607 --> 08:29.942
of their boyfriend
on their pillow case?

08:30.009 --> 08:33.846
He's in the bed! Hope Mitch knows
what he's let himself in for.

08:33.913 --> 08:37.283
Poor kid's probably chained
and gagged waiting for her.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.253
Oh, my God.
I live with a psychopath.

08:41.053 --> 08:43.688
Which little fucker is sleeping here?

08:43.756 --> 08:46.292
I reckon it might be a girl.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.428
Do you reckon?
Do you reckon or are you hoping?

08:49.495 --> 08:54.533
I'm thinking if a girl walks through
that door and she's skinny, pretty,

08:54.600 --> 08:56.702
what the fuck am I gonna do?

08:56.769 --> 08:59.639
Let's put bets on.
Boy. Girl. Boy. Boy.

08:59.705 --> 09:03.876
It's gotta be a boy. There's only
three boys and four girls.

09:03.943 --> 09:07.013
I think a boy. I reckon two birds.
No, never, never.

09:07.079 --> 09:11.517
There's eight beds, someone new has
got to walk through that door.

09:11.584 --> 09:14.687
(chanting)
One last shot, one last shot.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.856
And that could ruin all of this.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.191
(cheering)

09:24.130 --> 09:27.166
I'm Marnie, I'm 20,
I'm a natural beauty.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.903
Real boobs, real hair
and a really good arse.

09:30.970 --> 09:35.041
My motto is have no regrets and
live every day like it's your last.

09:35.107 --> 09:40.146
How do you feel? I'm a bit nervous
about Sophie but she's me cousin.

09:40.212 --> 09:43.983
I don't know how she'll feel coming
into her Geordie Shore family.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.018
How will everyone else react?

09:46.085 --> 09:49.689
I'm part of her real family.
We'll have to see her reaction.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.091
You're beautiful,
beautiful fresh meat.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.933
(doorbell rings)
Because I'm Sophie's cousin,

10:01.000 --> 10:06.505
everyone knows us. I hope they're
pleased to see us. It's Marnie.

10:06.572 --> 10:07.773
What the fuck?

10:07.840 --> 10:10.242
What the fuck's she doing here?
(laughter)

10:10.309 --> 10:12.278
This is gonna stir things up a lot.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.314
What the hell?
She just fell over.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.718
(squeals)

10:18.784 --> 10:21.821
Her arse is hanging out.
That's absolutely insane.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.490
Oh, my God.
Classy.

10:24.557 --> 10:28.894
It's me baby cousin Marnie, what
the fuck is she even doing here?

10:29.829 --> 10:32.631
Marnie is already flirting
with the lads.

10:33.933 --> 10:37.903
I am intimidated, she's fucking
gorgeous and I can't compete.

10:38.838 --> 10:41.407
Gaz's all over Charlotte,
she's got a lad.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.809
They're mortal.
They need to be careful.

10:43.876 --> 10:46.078
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:48.447 --> 10:48.647
.

10:51.150 --> 10:51.350
.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.096
Hello.
It's Marnie.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.266
(shouting)

11:07.333 --> 11:10.770
My baby cousin is here,
am I suppose to protect her?

11:10.836 --> 11:13.039
What happens if people slag her off,

11:13.105 --> 11:16.542
if she has an argument?
Am I gonna split from the girls?

11:16.609 --> 11:19.278
So many things
are running through me mind.

11:19.345 --> 11:24.016
I can't believe me little cousin's
here. Are you happy? I'm so buzzing.

11:24.083 --> 11:28.621
If it was me I'd feel like,
"This is my house." I'm in shock.

11:28.687 --> 11:32.525
I'm buzzing to have Marnie here.
She's good crack and she's nuts.

11:32.591 --> 11:34.827
A perfect addition to the house.

11:34.894 --> 11:39.065
Marnie's getting close to Scott.
She looks like she's flirty with him.

11:39.131 --> 11:43.135
I'll swap to the middle bed, you can
have the bed nearest the girls.

11:43.202 --> 11:46.305
Sandwiched between me and Gaz.
Can I swap with them?

11:48.107 --> 11:52.144
By coming in here and flirting with
the boys in front of the girls,

11:52.211 --> 11:54.380
this is a recipe
for fucking disaster.

11:54.447 --> 11:58.451
I don't know which way to turn.
Gary to me left, Scott at me right.

11:58.517 --> 12:01.487
I'm loving it.
Marnie's good at pulling.

12:08.594 --> 12:13.466
Yes, I am intimidated, she's
fucking gorgeous and I can't compete.

12:13.532 --> 12:17.269
Oi-oi!
To Marnie. Whoo!

12:17.336 --> 12:20.840
I don't know how the girls are gonna
take to Marnie being here.

12:20.906 --> 12:25.578
They'll get jealous. She's younger,
good crack and got a wicked arse.

12:25.644 --> 12:29.215
I'm a nice lass. I thought you'd be
happy to see us. I'm buzzing.

12:29.281 --> 12:33.586
(whispers) Marnie's nice. She's a
lovely girl. No disputing that.

12:39.091 --> 12:43.963
Fact is, she's Sophie's cousin,
she's a new girl coming in here.

12:44.029 --> 12:47.266
This makes things awkward
and difficult and different, OK?

12:47.333 --> 12:51.904
It's practically me sister and I'm
just gonna have to stick up for her.

12:51.971 --> 12:56.775
You've got me that's fine, but the
thing is they're gonna be bitchy.

12:56.842 --> 12:59.278
Everything's gonna change,
be stranger,

12:59.345 --> 13:02.248
everything's gonna be
a different dynamic.

13:02.314 --> 13:05.985
Marnie's arrival definitely puts
Sophie in an awkward position.

13:06.051 --> 13:08.320
Marnie is already flirting
with the lads.

13:08.387 --> 13:12.024
I've got the nicest arse, I've
been doing squats. Mine's better.

13:12.091 --> 13:16.228
Turn around, give us a look.
Oh, shit.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.533
You need to look after her.

13:23.169 --> 13:26.138
Marnie will fit in here
like hand to a glove.

13:26.205 --> 13:29.608
I'd love to get with Marnie
but it's a mate's ex,

13:29.675 --> 13:34.346
Sophie's cousin and the shit I'd get
in with Charlotte, it isn't worth it.

13:42.555 --> 13:47.359
Don't get us wrong, Gary is really
good-looking. I'm looking at Scott,

13:47.426 --> 13:49.128
he's got these amazing eyes.

13:49.195 --> 13:52.731
And it's making us get
fanny flutter already.

13:52.798 --> 13:56.869
Marnie's looking close to Scott and
I'm thinking, "This is awkward."

13:56.936 --> 14:01.974
Me and him used to flirt sometimes.
Looks like he's got another girl now.

14:02.041 --> 14:06.645
At the end of the day you can do
what you want. Gis a cuddle.

14:06.712 --> 14:08.948
Me and you bank is over.

14:09.014 --> 14:13.018
No more banking. No more scratchies.

14:13.085 --> 14:16.922
If Scott sleeps with Marnie that'd be
like her having my sloppy seconds

14:16.989 --> 14:18.958
and I wouldn't be having it back.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.960
You can do want you want.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.597
I'm not saying I'm not gonna be
jealous cos I would.

14:24.663 --> 14:27.866
If Marnie gets with Scott,
it's all gonna kick off.

14:27.933 --> 14:32.238
It's dangerous for Marnie to come in
and get with any of the lads.

14:32.304 --> 14:36.108
One, two, three!
To our first night!

14:36.175 --> 14:39.144
(cheering)

14:39.211 --> 14:42.047
First night in Newcastle,
we're hitting Floritas.

14:42.114 --> 14:46.085
(singing)

14:46.151 --> 14:48.954
We're gonna smash it
and hopefully Marnie as well.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.164
So far, so good.

14:59.231 --> 15:04.503
No bitchiness. If it's like this for
the rest of the time, I'm buzzing.

15:12.444 --> 15:15.247
Marnie's getting
sexually attracted to Scott.

15:15.314 --> 15:18.017
She's putting her bum
where his willy is.

15:18.083 --> 15:22.388
And she's grinding on him. That is
not gonna happen under my nose.

15:33.465 --> 15:36.402
Sophie's trying to warn us off Scott

15:36.468 --> 15:38.837
but I'm ultimately
gonna do what I want.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.380
Me and Charlotte are having a laugh,
flirting.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.816
Shit, she's got a boyfriend.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.926
Gaz is all over Charlotte,
she's got a lad.

16:00.993 --> 16:04.096
They're both mortal
and they need to be careful.

16:19.845 --> 16:23.082
Vicky's having a go,
telling me not to pull Marnie.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.250
She must be after me chod as well.

16:30.589 --> 16:34.326
I don't want anything to happen
cos it is stepping on my toes.

16:35.594 --> 16:39.298
I thought Scott would be
a little bit more respectful

16:39.365 --> 16:41.066
about one of his good friends.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.336
Why is everyone kicking off at me?
She came on to me.

16:44.403 --> 16:46.772
It's not my fault she fancies us.

16:46.839 --> 16:51.076
Charlotte is so pissed she's forgot
that she's got a boyfriend.

16:52.444 --> 16:54.246
I've got to take her home.

16:56.648 --> 17:01.620
I've got to intervene. I don't want
her to fuck stuff up with Mitch.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.288
Charlotte. Charlotte.

17:04.957 --> 17:09.528
I'm absolutely smashed and, shock,
I have to go home first again.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.169
Let's get out.

17:18.237 --> 17:20.739
Come on baby, jump.

17:20.806 --> 17:22.040
I've got you.

17:24.309 --> 17:29.014
You need to be strong, otherwise
you're gonna break Mitch's heart.

17:29.081 --> 17:33.685
Vicky thinks that Gary now knows
that I'm in love with Mitch

17:33.752 --> 17:35.687
and wants to change that.

17:35.754 --> 17:38.991
I'm still too drunk
to even know what's going on.

17:46.465 --> 17:50.536
So we get back and we're
absolutely fucking hammered.

17:50.602 --> 17:53.505
It's been a decent first night.
We're back.

17:53.572 --> 17:58.076
Charlotte, Charlotte, just let him
have it. Let him have it.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.812
It's less calories for you.

17:59.878 --> 18:02.881
Me and Charlotte
are having a laugh as friends.

18:02.948 --> 18:06.051
Everyone panics, thinks
we're flirting and breaks it up.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.720
That's yours,
that a nice little bit there.

18:08.787 --> 18:11.323
Charlotte,
I want a word with you mind.

18:11.390 --> 18:14.526
Charlotte and Gary are flirting.
He's a false bastard.

18:14.593 --> 18:19.031
Gary is me friend. Sophie and Vicky
need to take a chill pill.

18:24.036 --> 18:26.839
We're finally in a good place
where we're friends,

18:26.905 --> 18:30.309
like anyone else in the house
we're having a laugh.

18:33.912 --> 18:35.347
Get over it.

18:35.414 --> 18:38.584
You all right with us?
I'm fine, are you? Yeah.

18:38.650 --> 18:41.820
Back at the house, there's tension
between me and Holly.

18:41.887 --> 18:44.189
I just want to clear the air.

18:44.256 --> 18:46.692
What's the crack with you and Scott?

18:46.758 --> 18:50.929
Er... nothing, there's no crack.

18:50.996 --> 18:55.400
Obviously when there's no-one else
we get with each other sometimes.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.902
That's it really.

18:56.969 --> 19:00.372
Holly's clearly bothered.
She's trying to put on a front,

19:00.439 --> 19:02.808
but her face is saying it all.

19:02.875 --> 19:08.180
I'm not saying if you got with him I
wouldn't be jealous because I would.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.883
It's a girl thing, you know?
Yeah.

19:10.949 --> 19:15.120
So, the ball's in Marnie's court now,
I've told her how I feel.

19:15.187 --> 19:18.557
You know how I feel about it,
you act upon that.

19:18.624 --> 19:23.462
If she did get with Scott it would be
completely disrespectful towards me.

19:23.529 --> 19:28.367
I did actually think she liked Scott
more - In the kitchen earlier...

19:32.204 --> 19:34.806
I can hear everyone
outside talking about us.

19:37.376 --> 19:40.078
Marn? I can see you looking.

19:40.145 --> 19:45.617
Me and Scott both fancy each other,
it's just gonna happen.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.287
Yo, yo, yo. You OK?

19:48.353 --> 19:52.324
I go into Marnie's room and give her
a cheeky kiss good night.

19:52.391 --> 19:54.993
It's a shame I'm not
dusting her though.

19:58.130 --> 20:02.601
Scott is a really good kisser.
It's made us fancy him even more.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.038
Now I'm embarrassed.

20:06.104 --> 20:07.773
We're all in the garden

20:07.839 --> 20:12.444
and all the while the only two
people missing is Scott and Marnie.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.283
Lift up, this isn't right.

20:23.188 --> 20:26.058
I'm trying to help you
and your shit. Get out here!

20:26.124 --> 20:30.162
I might look like a cock-block
but I couldn't give a fuck because

20:30.228 --> 20:34.566
it'll be me picking up the pieces
when Marnie fucks with everything.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.535
I don't care what they think.

20:36.602 --> 20:39.371
I've got what I wanted and now
I'm going to bed happy.

20:39.438 --> 20:42.307
I told you how I felt
at the right moment.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.810
I didn't wait for it,
I didn't wait till after

20:44.876 --> 20:46.812
and then come be like, "Wah, Scott."

20:46.878 --> 20:49.214
Right now, I'm really angry about it.

20:49.281 --> 20:52.417
I told you at exactly
the right fucking time.

20:52.484 --> 20:55.320
You told me something,
which wasn't even relevant.

20:55.387 --> 21:00.258
I know Marnie's skinnier and prettier
and that's why he's gonna go for her.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.828
You're having a go
for something I haven't...

21:02.894 --> 21:05.764
OK, that's just fucking childish.
I know.

21:05.831 --> 21:07.332
I'm absolutely knackered.

21:07.399 --> 21:11.169
Good job he doesn't stay the night
cos I start spewing me ring up.

21:12.504 --> 21:16.375
Eventually I put meself to bed
and in comes Charlotte,

21:16.441 --> 21:19.845
stops at the bottom of me bed.
Ow!

21:19.911 --> 21:23.115
Falls off. Drops her pants.

21:24.282 --> 21:29.287
Everyone knows me, I pull
me pants down on the odd occasion.

21:29.354 --> 21:32.524
I was probably gonna have
a wee on the floor.

21:32.591 --> 21:34.660
Lift up.
No.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.828
Just anything.
Mitch.

21:36.895 --> 21:42.067
I'm Gary but your boyfriend's Mitch.
He's a nice lad and you're in bed now

21:42.134 --> 21:45.704
You're still good.
You can have some.

21:45.771 --> 21:50.409
Charlotte called me Mitch and said,
"It's OK, Gary, you can have some."

21:50.475 --> 21:54.279
I'm not entirely sure what that means
but Charlotte go to bed.

21:56.415 --> 21:58.283
I've got one! I've got one!

21:59.951 --> 22:01.186
Fucking weirdos.

22:01.253 --> 22:03.321
Where's the new bird?
I want to neck on.

22:03.388 --> 22:06.191
Why is Vicky trying to tash on
with me cousin Marnie?

22:07.092 --> 22:09.728
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:11.630 --> 22:11.830
.

22:14.366 --> 22:14.566
.

22:30.882 --> 22:31.883
Tongues.

22:34.386 --> 22:38.356
What the hell? The first night she's
here and she's already tashing on.

22:38.423 --> 22:39.858
It's the morning after

22:39.925 --> 22:43.929
and all me and the girls want to do
is bitch about Marnie.

22:43.995 --> 22:46.598
Fuck knows what's going on,
fuck knows man.

22:46.665 --> 22:50.902
Obviously she was asking about Scott
and everything, like what's going on?

22:50.969 --> 22:55.407
Nothing's going on but if you did
get with him I would be jealous.

22:55.474 --> 22:58.343
She said she fancies Scott
more than Gary.

22:58.410 --> 23:01.680
I obviously can't say anything.
You can, though.

23:01.747 --> 23:03.582
I just don't get it.

23:03.648 --> 23:06.651
Marnie's gone about this
the complete wrong way.

23:06.718 --> 23:10.188
She should have been trying
to get in with the girls.

23:10.255 --> 23:13.024
Not going for boys who have history.

23:13.091 --> 23:16.962
Pick something they've always wanted
to do. I wanna ride a motorbike.

23:17.028 --> 23:20.065
I wanna do something new
and different and interesting,

23:20.132 --> 23:25.036
get everyone together and make a
bucket list. It's gonna be amazing.

23:25.103 --> 23:27.172
I wanna learn how to fly a plane.

23:27.239 --> 23:31.309
I wanna be fired out a cannon
into a lake. Can you do that?

23:31.376 --> 23:33.278
There's loads on my bucket list,

23:33.345 --> 23:36.615
find the Loch Ness monster
and fucking chin it.

23:36.681 --> 23:42.687
I've decided that I want to expand
me mind and be involved in Mensa.

23:44.055 --> 23:48.860
I would like to have chickens.
Live ones? To lay eggs.

23:48.927 --> 23:52.931
Charlotte wants to get chickens.
She has things in common with them

23:52.998 --> 23:55.200
like pissing and shitting
everywhere.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.935
Was that everything?
Yeah.

23:57.002 --> 24:01.106
Don't know who's got more chance of
doing what. Holly getting into Mensa

24:01.173 --> 24:03.975
or Scott meeting
the Loch Ness fucking monster.

24:04.042 --> 24:09.181
Hiya, is this the chicken line?
My bucket list suggestion's first.

24:09.247 --> 24:13.451
It's up there with the best, it's
a main priority, it's underway now.

24:13.518 --> 24:17.823
I was wondering if you had any hens
that we could come and see.

24:17.889 --> 24:20.492
So I'm ringing the chicken line.

24:20.559 --> 24:25.397
We're gonna come soon and have a
look at them, so we'll see you soon.

24:25.463 --> 24:28.867
I'm so buzzing. We get to pick up
the chickens today,

24:28.934 --> 24:31.937
that means first thing
ticked off our bucket list.

24:32.003 --> 24:36.608
So we get to the chicken farm
and there's chickens everywhere.

24:36.675 --> 24:39.277
Chicken to the left, right,
to the front,

24:39.344 --> 24:43.048
it's making us want a Sunday dinner.
I'm in Nandos.

24:43.114 --> 24:46.718
Have they got big brains?
They're not as daft as people think.

24:46.785 --> 24:49.087
(shouts)
Don't scare it.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.756
(clucks)

24:51.823 --> 24:53.758
I've got one! I've got one!

24:53.825 --> 24:56.461
Charlotte's got a chicken,
we need to name it.

24:56.528 --> 25:00.732
What do you want to call her then?
Rachel. Vicky, it's your turn.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.801
I can do this. Fucking chicken time.

25:02.868 --> 25:06.605
I am absolutely atrocious
at catching chickens.

25:06.671 --> 25:07.906
(laughs)

25:07.973 --> 25:11.042
Charlotte on the other hand...
Leave it to the experts.

25:11.109 --> 25:15.180
..is exceptional at catching
chickens. Oh, my God.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.482
Quick. Chicken time.

25:17.549 --> 25:21.219
It's going in me fanny.
I feel like I've given birth.

25:21.286 --> 25:23.855
I'll let you call this one.
Elizabeth?

25:23.922 --> 25:28.460
We decide to name the chickens
Rachel and Elizabeth.

25:28.526 --> 25:30.028
I don't know why.

25:30.095 --> 25:31.930
I can smell chicken shit.

25:31.997 --> 25:36.301
What the fuck's it gonna smell like
in the house? That's what I thought.

25:36.368 --> 25:41.172
It's disgusting. I'm never going
into the garden, it's gonna stink.

25:41.239 --> 25:42.974
Oh, my God. (coughs)

25:43.041 --> 25:46.444
You get the odd whiff, don't you?
I'm going to be sick.

25:46.511 --> 25:50.348
(gags) Like I've got the gaps
going in me face.

25:50.415 --> 25:52.918
It smells like pure diarrhoea.
I feel sick.

25:52.984 --> 25:55.020
Shh, we've gotta sneak in.

25:55.086 --> 25:59.658
So we get home and introduce Rachel
and Elizabeth the rest of the house.

25:59.724 --> 26:02.727
The boys are buzzing
to see the chickens

26:02.794 --> 26:05.597
because they know
it's full of protein.

26:05.664 --> 26:09.100
(chattering)
Oh, my God, that one's got legs.

26:09.167 --> 26:13.204
Charlotte's got carried away. She
seems to think to know the chicken,

26:13.271 --> 26:17.776
she has to be a chicken
so she's eating worms. Two, one.

26:17.842 --> 26:21.813
I cannot believe Charlotte just put
one of those worms in her mouth.

26:23.448 --> 26:26.985
But she's sucked Gary's cock
and that's riddled with worms.

26:33.124 --> 26:35.927
Gather round people, gather round.

26:35.994 --> 26:37.329
(cheering)

26:37.395 --> 26:40.598
Anna's about to tell us
what the job's gonna be.

26:40.665 --> 26:43.001
Guys, Geordie Tours is back.

26:43.068 --> 26:44.903
(cheering)

26:44.970 --> 26:47.639
And sure enough
we've got work tonight.

26:47.706 --> 26:52.077
Girls Sophie, Vicky, Marnie,
there's a bar crawl,

26:52.143 --> 26:53.578
theme is tashing on.

26:53.645 --> 26:55.613
Wha-hey!

26:55.680 --> 26:58.516
I'm not bothered about working.
I like bar crawls

26:58.583 --> 27:02.554
and I fucking love tashing on
so this is right up my street.

27:08.727 --> 27:12.564
Get your tashes. You've gotta have
the curtains matching the carpet.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.499
It's not going on down there.

27:14.566 --> 27:17.102
(cheering)

27:17.168 --> 27:19.504
I think you'll find we won that.

27:19.571 --> 27:22.107
(chanting) Next bar, next bar!

27:23.475 --> 27:25.210
Everyone's getting drunk

27:25.276 --> 27:28.480
and we're gonna feed them
with more alcohol. Argh!

27:28.546 --> 27:30.648
Sophie is the worst hostess.

27:30.715 --> 27:34.419
Not only has she knocked the drinks
absolutely everywhere,

27:34.486 --> 27:38.723
she's then following that up by
trying to wipe it off the table

27:38.790 --> 27:41.593
into glasses to give to our clients.

27:43.795 --> 27:46.798
Anna would fucking kick off
if she could see her now.

27:52.303 --> 27:55.306
Why is Vicky trying to tash on
with Marnie?

27:55.373 --> 27:57.375
Now Vicky even fancies her too.

27:57.442 --> 27:59.377
I'm really getting on with Marnie.

27:59.444 --> 28:02.480
I think she's fun, lovely.
She's a nice girl.

28:06.284 --> 28:10.455
I feel like it's me duty
to warn her to stay away from Scott.

28:23.234 --> 28:27.372
I don't know what Vicky's problem
is, she needs to butt out.

28:27.439 --> 28:32.177
Tash on bar crawl, next Destination.
We're moving on to the next bar

28:32.243 --> 28:36.648
and it's starting to look like
we've done too much of a good job.

28:36.714 --> 28:39.451
Oh!
You all right?

28:39.517 --> 28:42.253
(chanting) Tash on, tash on!
(cheering)

28:44.956 --> 28:48.626
We're in the last bar
and decide it's the perfect time

28:48.693 --> 28:51.763
to draw moustaches on each other,
excellent idea.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.270
Where's those baby wipes?

29:01.272 --> 29:03.842
If a girl is living in our room,
suitcase open,

29:03.908 --> 29:06.945
me and Scott are obviously
gonna check her thongs

29:07.011 --> 29:08.947
and give them a sniff.

29:09.013 --> 29:10.448
Fucking weirdoes.

29:10.515 --> 29:13.318
Oh! Fucking hell.

29:13.384 --> 29:16.921
Charlotte leaves her pissy shitty
knickers lying around,

29:16.988 --> 29:18.756
they never sniff them.

29:18.823 --> 29:22.160
To be honest
I don't massively know Marnie.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.162
But after me telling Scott that,

29:24.229 --> 29:28.366
I felt like he should have had
a bit more respect for me.

29:28.433 --> 29:32.370
All we can talk about is how Marnie
kissed Scott last night.

29:32.437 --> 29:35.106
After everything was said
she still kissed him.

29:35.173 --> 29:37.142
Why wouldn't I be jealous?

29:37.208 --> 29:39.944
Marnie doesn't want
to be friends with us.

29:40.011 --> 29:42.013
He was arguing with me about it.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.083
"Nothing's happened
and you're putting it in me head."

29:45.150 --> 29:48.386
"Scott, I'm telling you how I feel."

29:48.453 --> 29:52.257
Marnie's upset my friend,
who does she think she is?

29:52.323 --> 29:56.361
She's not gonna get by easy
if that's the way she's gonna go on.

29:56.427 --> 29:59.931
At the end of the day,
he was my banker.

29:59.998 --> 30:02.100
Banker.
Banker.

30:02.167 --> 30:04.936
There's no fucking way
I'd go back there again.

30:05.003 --> 30:07.472
Just hope she gives a good sucky.

30:08.373 --> 30:10.008
Cheers, son, all the best.

30:10.074 --> 30:12.277
Tonight we're smashing
House of Smith.

30:12.343 --> 30:15.380
I might neck on with Marnie
or another bird.

30:15.446 --> 30:17.582
I'm a single lad, who fucking knows?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.384
Yeah!

30:31.563 --> 30:36.034
I'm getting smashed. Where's the new
bird cos I wanna neck on with her?

30:38.169 --> 30:42.240
Everyone loves sex so if she's not
gonna give me it, I'll go elsewhere.

30:44.042 --> 30:48.947
If they wanna do the dance with no
pants, they won't get my blessing.

30:49.013 --> 30:51.249
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

30:53.551 --> 30:53.751
.

30:56.287 --> 30:56.487
.

31:06.331 --> 31:10.768
I'm getting smashed. Where's the new
bird cos I wanna neck on with her?

31:10.835 --> 31:14.505
He pulled with me every night
in Australia, even pipped me,

31:14.572 --> 31:19.010
and banged more birds and now
he's saving himself for Marnie?

31:19.077 --> 31:22.413
I'm so hung-over,
Charlotte looks like a twat,

31:22.480 --> 31:25.717
I hope it gets better
when the girls get here.

31:26.784 --> 31:31.389
So Sophie, Marnie and Vicky rock up,
they've had a mint time at work.

31:34.192 --> 31:38.129
Instead of Marnie making an effort
with us, she's over to Scott.

31:38.196 --> 31:41.299
Marnie turns up with a moustache
drawn on her face,

31:41.366 --> 31:43.401
I'll still neck on with her.

31:43.468 --> 31:48.973
Marnie hasn't got anything against
Holly. She literally fancies Scott.

31:58.516 --> 32:01.919
I care more about Holly's feelings
than Scott's cock.

32:04.756 --> 32:09.694
If they wanna do the dance with no
pants, they won't get my blessing.

32:20.438 --> 32:24.609
I don't know why Vicky's giving
Scott advice, he doesn't listen.

32:31.215 --> 32:32.417
I'm talking to Scott

32:32.483 --> 32:36.454
and I can feel Holly's eyes
burning a hole in the me neck.

32:42.293 --> 32:46.197
Oh, God, cuz, please stop it.
Everything's starting already.

32:46.264 --> 32:50.234
I can't be bothered
for this confrontational drama.

32:51.836 --> 32:53.771
I tell Marnie how I'm feeling.

32:56.007 --> 33:00.011
Sophie's telling me she wants
to leave because of me and Scott.

33:00.078 --> 33:03.147
I think she's being
a bit of a drama queen.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.754
I've had enough.
I wanna go home and stuff me face.

33:16.327 --> 33:19.997
Sophie, Charlotte and Holly decide
to go home. I can't blame them.

33:23.334 --> 33:26.704
Now they've gone we can have
a good night without boring faces

33:26.771 --> 33:28.673
staring the shit out of us.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.884
Marnie's asked me out for a chat
and by chat she means

33:39.951 --> 33:41.986
neck on, I knaa your game.

33:45.723 --> 33:48.526
I just hope that no-one's seen us
kiss Scott.

33:50.328 --> 33:52.930
Just before we leave,
Scott's talking to Marnie,

33:52.997 --> 33:56.234
Vicky's with James
and I've managed to get some friend.

34:05.543 --> 34:09.914
When you're single it gets lonely
and you want girls back to cuddle.

34:13.851 --> 34:15.987
I've never been Gary's biggest fan

34:16.053 --> 34:18.989
but I don't wanna hear anyone
say they're lonely or sad.

34:37.108 --> 34:39.177
Vicky offers to cuddle us.

34:39.243 --> 34:42.847
But why would I cuddle you
when I've got this beauty?

34:47.284 --> 34:49.654
Do it, girl. Just do it.

34:49.719 --> 34:53.123
Look, I appreciate it.
I'll talk to you tomorrow. Yeah.

34:53.190 --> 34:55.626
I'll leave you.

34:55.693 --> 34:58.329
No, no, no.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

34:59.664 --> 35:02.767
I was chatting to Gaz
cos he's a nice lad.

35:02.834 --> 35:06.938
And I'm trying to just say to him,
"Ah, no bother."

35:07.004 --> 35:09.907
She come over
and shoved tequila in my face.

35:09.974 --> 35:13.811
Vicky will learn that sometimes
you've gotta pull to get a cuddle.

35:15.546 --> 35:19.851
It always ends up banging but it's
still someone giving you affection.

35:28.392 --> 35:30.962
I end up getting in bed with Scott.

35:32.864 --> 35:37.768
We have a little kiss and a cuddle
and I have to admit I like it.

35:39.203 --> 35:43.107
I'm in bed with Marnie, thinking,
"I could be in for a good night."

35:52.183 --> 35:54.919
My number one rule
when you pull a girl

35:54.986 --> 35:57.321
is get them up and out early.

35:57.388 --> 36:01.459
Gary's kicked his critter out.
I wanna talk to him about our chat.

36:01.526 --> 36:04.829
Is he really lonely?
Is that the reason he pulls?

36:15.907 --> 36:19.544
You only have sex with girls
so you can get a cuddle?

36:19.610 --> 36:21.779
That sounds wicked, doesn't it?

36:21.846 --> 36:24.348
You had, like, all the...

36:31.889 --> 36:35.126
As part of me bucket list
I'm learning how to fly.

36:35.192 --> 36:38.129
It shouldn't be hard
I'm used to having wings.

36:38.195 --> 36:41.499
We're on our way to our first proper
bucket list idea.

36:41.566 --> 36:43.768
Fuck the chickens, I'm going flying.

36:45.236 --> 36:48.005
Will we get parachutes?
Like just in case.

36:48.072 --> 36:50.608
Do you have an ejector seat?

36:50.675 --> 36:52.476
I'm a little bit apprehensive.

36:52.543 --> 36:56.814
The most powerful thing I've ever
been in charge of is a lawnmower.

36:56.881 --> 36:57.982
Whoo! Argh!

36:58.049 --> 37:01.319
Calm, collected. All right,
you can be supportive. I will.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.654
Am I driving this now or you?

37:03.721 --> 37:06.958
I was gonna say I'm quite good
at this. (laughs)

37:07.024 --> 37:10.294
Whee!
Oh, my God we're in the air.

37:10.361 --> 37:12.563
(squeals)

37:12.630 --> 37:17.301
Oh, my God, is that you or me?
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

37:17.368 --> 37:19.036
I'm flying!

37:19.103 --> 37:22.540
Look, there's the Tyne Bridge.
That is unbelievable that, man.

37:22.607 --> 37:26.744
Holly's telling us that when Marnie
came in she warned her off Scott.

37:26.811 --> 37:31.983
He's who I flirt with, who I do
things with when there's nobody else.

37:32.049 --> 37:34.285
They've only banged
a couple of times,

37:34.352 --> 37:36.921
she hasn't got the right to do that.

37:36.988 --> 37:40.925
I just hope there isn't a big divide
and kick-off with the girls.

37:40.992 --> 37:45.963
There's no toilet. How the fuck
do I join the mile-high club?

37:46.030 --> 37:49.800
Get off and let us fucking land
this plane. I've done it.

37:49.867 --> 37:52.436
That's better than sex.
Michael, boom.

37:52.503 --> 37:54.572
So avoid the flaps.
That's it.

37:55.640 --> 37:59.577
The plane's fucking tiny, I'm gonna
struggle to fit a pec in there.

37:59.644 --> 38:02.446
I should have rang,
told them Hercules was coming.

38:07.084 --> 38:09.186
Me and James are in this plane.

38:09.253 --> 38:13.591
I'm sharing his lifelong dream
to fly a plane so I go to sleep.

38:17.828 --> 38:21.932
It's comfy falling asleep on the
plane, better than the beds at home.

38:23.267 --> 38:25.636
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

38:28.606 --> 38:33.344
How Holly can sleep through this?
I'm screaming when the plane moves.

38:33.411 --> 38:35.413
Shit! Fuck!

38:35.479 --> 38:37.748
Shit!

38:37.815 --> 38:40.151
I'm shitting meself.

38:42.286 --> 38:47.291
I'm far too young and good-looking
to die. (chatters)

38:56.333 --> 38:59.603
Yay! We're safe,
we're not gonna die, Holly.

38:59.670 --> 39:03.107
Did you enjoy that then?
Aye, it was scary, did you?

39:03.174 --> 39:04.175
Yeah.

39:05.476 --> 39:08.212
Mint. There's one to tick off
the bucket list.

39:08.279 --> 39:12.717
I think I'll stick to waxing me
eyebrows and doing me hair.

39:20.891 --> 39:24.495
Third night out, I've decided to
leave the things with me and Scott

39:24.562 --> 39:27.832
cos it's causing too many problems
with the girls.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.971
Sophie's being better with us,

39:34.038 --> 39:37.641
only because I said I was gonna
stay away from Scott.

39:46.350 --> 39:50.688
She doesn't have to run after Scott,
there's plenty of other men around.

39:55.292 --> 39:58.629
If she's not gonna give me sex,
I'll go elsewhere.

39:58.696 --> 40:01.866
It's been an exciting day,
we've got the chickens.

40:01.932 --> 40:04.668
Let's go to Bijoux, celebrate,
and get mortal.

40:07.638 --> 40:10.207
(all) Cheers!

40:29.126 --> 40:32.229
It's hard for us to stay away
from each other,

40:32.296 --> 40:34.198
there's so much sexual chemistry.

40:42.072 --> 40:47.311
Scott's telling us he wants to pull
and get back to doing what we do best

41:12.369 --> 41:16.307
Me and Vicky are talking about
finding some good-looking boys.

41:16.373 --> 41:20.044
Straight away I notice Scott is
definitely the best out of anyone.

41:20.110 --> 41:23.781
Scott's talking to a girl,
I'm trying to act like I don't care

41:23.848 --> 41:28.953
but I do. I'm gonna go over and try
and cock-block him as much as I can.

41:36.427 --> 41:40.865
Me cock-blocking worked
and now me Scott are flirting again.

41:47.504 --> 41:52.610
Everyone was in good spirits,
however Scott was not a good wingman.

41:55.512 --> 42:00.284
All this Geordie girl wants right
now is a big greasy dirty fat kebab.

42:01.752 --> 42:05.055
Oh, my God,
I have missed kebabs so much.

42:05.122 --> 42:09.660
I don't know if I want to wee
or have the kebab. Have the kebab.

42:09.727 --> 42:13.597
They're like animals. They've got
kebab meat hanging from their face.

42:13.664 --> 42:16.467
Lady and the Tramp, ready?

42:16.533 --> 42:20.371
I used to find it weird,
now that's just normal.

42:20.437 --> 42:23.440
I've never seen her so happy
in her life.

42:23.507 --> 42:26.477
It's made of pig's cock.
I still love it.

42:26.543 --> 42:28.379
Me and Scott haven't pulled.

42:28.445 --> 42:32.549
I can see this going one way,
we're gonna end up necking on.

42:38.155 --> 42:42.159
Marnie and Scott have decided
to stay away from each other.

42:42.226 --> 42:45.329
I didn't pull tonight
cos Marnie proper cock-blocked us

42:45.396 --> 42:48.299
so I get into her bed.

42:48.365 --> 42:52.403
Me plan to stay away from Scott
has failed miserably.

42:52.469 --> 42:56.840
I'm in his bed and we're having
a kiss underneath the covers.

43:01.612 --> 43:04.682
Shit, I'm starting to get
really close to Scott

43:04.748 --> 43:07.685
and I realise that I do like him
and I can't fight it.

43:12.556 --> 43:16.293
The size of these willies.
It would come out me mouth.

43:17.928 --> 43:21.665
Is he not speaking to us?
I've gotta sort this out.

43:24.468 --> 43:27.171
Gary's got his wingman back.

43:28.706 --> 43:31.241
Why is there a chicken in the room?

43:31.308 --> 43:34.411
He's gutted
he's fucked his chances up with me.

44:00.104 --> 44:00.304
.
