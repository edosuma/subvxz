00:03.115 --> 00:04.767
Peace Corps
is incredibly selective.

00:04.792 --> 00:05.692
Eritrea?

00:05.717 --> 00:07.061
Can't you just
be happy for me?

00:07.710 --> 00:08.972
What's going on, Jay?

00:08.997 --> 00:10.094
Come with me...

00:13.388 --> 00:14.631
You're being reassigned.

00:14.962 --> 00:17.083
- Okay, that's enough.
- Who are you?

00:17.084 --> 00:18.317
Lena Smith.
I'm your new boss.

00:18.385 --> 00:20.753
I think you were being
underutilized at the D.P.D.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.089
I want you to do
high security clearance

00:23.156 --> 00:26.058

This way, please.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.208
Annie.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.743
You look like
you got some color.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.044
I was able to make the sweep.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.346
Whatever's on
Simon Fisher's tablet

01:53.413 --> 01:54.814
is now on that.
Nice work.

01:54.881 --> 01:56.082
I knew you'd be
great at this job.

01:56.149 --> 01:57.383
I do have some concerns about

01:57.451 --> 01:59.652
the value of what's on there.
Meaning?

01:59.720 --> 02:02.355
Meaning...it all
came a bit too easily.

02:02.422 --> 02:05.124
- Maybe you're just that good.
- I don't know.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.393
The passports
of those German spies?

02:07.461 --> 02:08.494
Keep talking, I'm listening.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.895
He left them right
out in the open.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.666
Like he wanted me to find them.
Think he's on to you?

02:13.734 --> 02:14.800
I don't know,
he's hard to read.

02:14.868 --> 02:16.369
As are you.

02:16.436 --> 02:18.904
Decompress these files,
tell me what you find.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.374
Did you spend the night with
Simon in Marrakech?

02:21.441 --> 02:23.376
Uh...yeah.

02:23.443 --> 02:26.011
Do you have
someone in your life?

02:26.079 --> 02:27.413
A boyfriend?

02:27.481 --> 02:29.448
No, I don't have a boyfriend.

02:29.516 --> 02:30.549
Someone you care about?

02:30.617 --> 02:32.651
Someone who would
be compromised by this?

02:32.719 --> 02:36.122
No, I'm completely free
and unencumbered.

02:36.189 --> 02:37.256
Now I'm just looking
forward to getting

02:37.324 --> 02:39.458
a good night's sleep
in my own bed.

02:39.526 --> 02:41.127
Go then.

02:41.194 --> 02:43.829
I'll let you know what we find.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.498
Great.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.466
Excuse me, Lena, but the
D.C.S. would like to see you

02:47.534 --> 02:51.904
in his office and he asked that
Miss Walker come along as well.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.846
Lena, sorry to pull you away.
Annie, could you wait outside?

03:00.914 --> 03:05.885
Of course.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.823
This doesn't look good.

03:10.891 --> 03:14.059
Your two moms getting called
to the principal's office.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.195
Did you do something wrong?

03:16.263 --> 03:19.331
Probably.

03:19.399 --> 03:22.435
I didn't know Lena
reported to Arthur.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.737
I didn't know Lena
reported to anybody.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.639
You know what this is about?

03:26.706 --> 03:27.973
My guess is it
has something to do

03:28.041 --> 03:31.043
with what happened in Barcelona
this morning.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.044
This morning,
Spanish intelligence detained

03:32.112 --> 03:33.512
a Canadian couple
who were trying

03:33.580 --> 03:35.247
to enter Barcelona from Livorno.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.216
A Mr. and Mrs. Ken
and Andrea Quinn.

03:37.284 --> 03:39.685
They came to Barcelona
to purchase a hand-crafted

03:39.753 --> 03:42.154
computer virus from
a hacker known as Red Rover.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.890
- Red Rover?
- His handle's all we've got.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.192
He's been on our radar
for three years,

03:46.259 --> 03:47.860
but he's been able
to maintain his anonymity.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.763
- And the Canadians' angle?
- Fronts for the Chinese.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.032
It's China's new M.O.
on the continent.

03:53.099 --> 03:55.634
Europeans prefer to do business
with other white faces.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.670
Canadians seem harmless.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.138
Is that what we're looking
at here, Joan?

03:59.206 --> 04:01.674
Yes, it is.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.042
MSS is backing them.

04:03.109 --> 04:04.343
But they don't know
their fronts have been

04:04.411 --> 04:05.544
taken off the game board yet.

04:05.612 --> 04:07.546
This gives us
a rare opportunity.

04:07.614 --> 04:10.082
If we can send a team out
to pose as the Quinns,

04:10.150 --> 04:11.817
we can make the buy
and bring the malware

04:11.885 --> 04:13.819
back to reverse engineer.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.988
So even if the Chinese
obtain another copy,

04:16.055 --> 04:17.656
we can inoculate its target.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.625
So what does this have
to do with me?

04:19.692 --> 04:21.293
Annie and Auggie have been

04:21.361 --> 04:22.728
spearheading the
D.P.D.'s attempt

04:22.796 --> 04:24.797
to locate and neutralize
Red Rover,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.365
but due to the recent...

04:26.433 --> 04:28.100
reorganization--
Neither of them

04:28.168 --> 04:29.568
report to you anymore.
Right.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.370
Now I see what this
is all about.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.838
Um

04:32.906 --> 04:34.573
is it bigger than a bread box?
No.

04:34.641 --> 04:36.809
No? You just said yes
a few questions ago.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.210
I don't get why everything
always has to be compared

04:38.278 --> 04:40.746
to a bread box.
Oh, I don't know.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.281
I think this game
was more fun in theory.

04:42.349 --> 04:43.282
Yeah.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.950
The Stuxnet virus dismantled

04:45.018 --> 04:46.752
Iran's nuclear
enrichment program.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.387
If this one's aimed at us,

04:48.455 --> 04:49.822
who knows what damage
it could do?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.557
You're telling me why
it's something we need to do.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.961
You're not telling me why it's
something Annie needs to do.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.663
Eh, how long are
we talking here?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.732
We put them on
the next flight out,

04:59.799 --> 05:03.602
they're back tomorrow evening.
36 hours, max.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.437
What do you think, Lena?

05:05.505 --> 05:07.106
Ts hasn't already
been decided?

05:07.173 --> 05:09.642
This is the first
I'm hearing about it.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.644
I'm hoping we can talk this out.

05:11.711 --> 05:13.379
Well, I can't afford
to lose Annie at this stage.

05:13.446 --> 05:14.847
She just started working
for you.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.215
And she's just beginning
to learn.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.950
She got her foot in the door,

05:18.018 --> 05:19.952
I need to make sure she's able
to keep it there.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.787
Annie's game and enthusiastic,

05:21.855 --> 05:26.926
but she's picked up some
bad habits along the way.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.228
I'm not sure how
we resolve this.

05:29.296 --> 05:32.665
Well, Arthur, you've been put
in an awkward situation here.

05:32.732 --> 05:36.201
Someone's gonna need
to be the bigger person.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.941
There goes
your good night's sleep.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.909
You two have always campaigned
to go out in the field together.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.345
Well, here's your chance.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.881
Congratulations, Mrs. Quinn.
Mr. Quinn.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.884
For the next 36 hours, I now
pronounce you husband and wife.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.669

Wait, I thought you came here
to unpack.

I did.
And now I'm packing back up

06:54.732 --> 06:56.032

Today?

06:56.100 --> 06:59.969
Yeah, today.

07:00.037 --> 07:01.938
Are you going
for the Smithsonian,

07:02.006 --> 07:05.708
or are you going for--

07:05.776 --> 07:08.211
Hey, normally I wouldn't
ask those kinds of questions,

07:08.279 --> 07:10.480
you know I wouldn't.
It's just that I'm a little

07:10.547 --> 07:12.949
shaken with
what happened yesterday.

07:13.017 --> 07:17.387
What happened yesterday?

07:17.454 --> 07:19.155
Jai Wilcox died in
a rock climbing accident

07:19.223 --> 07:21.658
in West Virginia.

07:21.725 --> 07:25.895
It was in all the papers.

07:25.963 --> 07:29.565
I did...
I did hear that actually.

07:29.633 --> 07:34.037
It's awful. I'm so sorry.

07:34.104 --> 07:35.705
I know I only met him that one
time he came over for dinner,

07:35.773 --> 07:36.906
but I really liked him.

07:36.974 --> 07:40.643
I did too.
He was a good friend.

07:40.711 --> 07:43.212
Well, how, um--

07:43.280 --> 07:44.447
how good a friend was he?

07:44.515 --> 07:46.883
Um, what do you mean?

07:46.950 --> 07:48.685
Well, they're saying that
he was Henry Wilcox's son.

07:48.752 --> 07:50.687
So did he work
for the State Department,

07:50.754 --> 07:54.857
or did he also--

07:54.925 --> 08:00.163
I'm doing it again, aren't I?

08:00.230 --> 08:05.068
Did Jai really die in
a rock climbing accident?

08:05.135 --> 08:07.236
I gotta get to the airport.

08:07.304 --> 08:08.371
I understand.

08:08.439 --> 08:12.709
Come back soon, okay?

08:19.616 --> 08:21.818
Bad news.

08:21.885 --> 08:23.920
One of us has a middle seat.
Oh.

08:23.987 --> 08:25.221
I'd say
I'd flip you for it,

08:25.289 --> 08:27.357
but do you really need a window?

08:28.726 --> 08:30.493
I'll take the middle.
You sure?

08:30.561 --> 08:32.595
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going
back out into the field,

08:32.663 --> 08:35.365
I'd sit in baggage
if I had to.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.566
Can I ask you a question?

08:36.633 --> 08:40.035
Since when did you start
asking permission?

08:40.104 --> 08:41.571
What are we doing here?

08:41.638 --> 08:43.373
Are you having some sort
of metaphysical dilemma?

08:43.440 --> 08:44.774
Because if you are--

08:44.842 --> 08:46.342
You're the one who's
been tracking Red Rover.

08:46.410 --> 08:49.145
You know the world,
you know the players.

08:49.213 --> 08:51.447
What did I do, help you with
a few hours of research?

08:51.515 --> 08:52.715
This isn't the first time

08:52.783 --> 08:55.184
you've been underqualified,
you know?

08:55.252 --> 08:56.753
Come on, Auggie.
I'm serious.

08:56.820 --> 08:59.122
All right, look.

08:59.189 --> 09:01.124
Joan's fiefdom is under attack.

09:01.191 --> 09:03.326
She's not the type
to walk away from a fight,

09:03.394 --> 09:05.995
so pulling us back,
even for just a day,

09:06.063 --> 09:09.365
sends the message that
she won't just roll over.

09:09.433 --> 09:10.666
Do you think it's permanent?

09:10.734 --> 09:12.702
Us being reassigned?

09:12.770 --> 09:16.339
Nothing is ever permanent
in the Agency.

09:16.407 --> 09:18.775
But it's best if you carry
yourself as if it were.

09:18.842 --> 09:21.310
Flight 9219--

09:21.378 --> 09:23.279
That's us, darling.

09:23.347 --> 09:26.783
So, what's it like working
for Lena?

09:26.850 --> 09:29.485
I don't know.
I'm not sure yet.

09:29.553 --> 09:31.087
Tell you one thing--

09:31.155 --> 09:33.523
she's really different
than Joan.

09:33.590 --> 09:36.759
- Yeah, how so?
- Mm, she's more approachable.

09:36.827 --> 09:37.994
You know?

09:38.061 --> 09:40.496
Like we're all
in it together, as equals.

09:40.564 --> 09:42.632
She's given me plenty
of autonomy so far.

09:42.699 --> 09:44.667
Really? Where'd she send
you first?

09:44.735 --> 09:46.602
Nowhere, just
a local fact-finding mission

09:46.670 --> 09:47.804
to get my feet under me.

09:47.871 --> 09:50.039
Local? Huh.

09:50.107 --> 09:55.111
Since when did Marrakech
become local?

09:55.179 --> 09:56.446
I'm sorry.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.614
How'd you know?

09:58.682 --> 10:01.584
I could tell from
your tan lines.

10:01.652 --> 10:03.152
Look, don't worry about it.

10:03.220 --> 10:05.955
I know how hard it is
to serve a new master.

10:06.023 --> 10:09.292
But, you will need to pay
for that little indiscretion.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.794
Mm, I know.
I'll take the middle seat.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.030
Oh, it's like
you can read my mind.

10:19.136 --> 10:21.704
- Lena.
- Joan.

10:21.772 --> 10:23.473
Thank you...

10:23.540 --> 10:25.308
for your understanding earlier.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.576
I hope Annie's absence

10:26.643 --> 10:28.478
hasn't jeopardized anything
too critical.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.079
Is this you gloating, Joan?

10:30.147 --> 10:31.380
You've always been so remote.

10:31.448 --> 10:32.715
It's hard to read you sometimes.

10:32.783 --> 10:36.886
Oh, I think you
read me just fine.

10:36.954 --> 10:38.321
I don't get how
you run your department.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.856
You're willing to jeopardize

10:39.923 --> 10:41.257
the big picture just
to chalk up a win.

10:41.325 --> 10:43.860
I might have picked up some
bad habits along the way.

10:43.927 --> 10:46.229
Like dragging me without
warning in front of the D.C.S.?

10:46.296 --> 10:48.064
I was just following protocol.

10:49.533 --> 10:52.235
So that's what that was.

10:52.302 --> 10:54.237
We're not the new girls
in Nairobi anymore,

10:54.304 --> 10:55.705
trying to make our stripes.

10:55.772 --> 10:57.773
It diminishes the both of us
when you run to a man

10:57.841 --> 10:58.975
to help solve our problems,

10:59.042 --> 11:00.376
even if that man
is your husband.

11:00.444 --> 11:02.712
That man also outranks you,

11:02.779 --> 11:04.514
so I'd watch how
you refer to him.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.717
The next time you want some
consideration regarding

11:07.784 --> 11:09.252
one of my operatives,

11:09.319 --> 11:14.657
just come to me directly.

11:21.899 --> 11:23.165
It's 12:08.

11:23.233 --> 11:24.634
The meeting was set for noon.

11:24.701 --> 11:27.036
Well, we are
on Barcelona time.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.704
I'm just saying, if you were
back at your desk right now,

11:28.772 --> 11:31.307
this would be the time you'd
tell me to pull the ripcord.

11:31.375 --> 11:32.575
Yeah, and then
you wouldn't listen to me,

11:32.643 --> 11:34.710
and you'd do whatever you want.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.178
Mm.

11:36.246 --> 11:37.813
Why are you sitting
so far away?

11:37.881 --> 11:39.081
We're married.

11:39.149 --> 11:40.683
This is supposed to be romantic.

11:40.751 --> 11:45.788
Give me your hand.

11:45.856 --> 11:48.791
That's better.

11:48.859 --> 11:50.826
You're enjoying this
way too much.

11:50.894 --> 11:52.061
Aw, I'm enjoying this

11:52.129 --> 11:54.864
just the right amount.

11:54.932 --> 11:55.865
Oh.

12:14.518 --> 12:16.686
- What's going on?
- Change of plans.

12:16.753 --> 12:18.354
How many different ways
can this go wrong?

12:18.422 --> 12:21.290
Besides the obvious red flag
of changing the meeting spot,

12:21.358 --> 12:22.825
there's a few.

12:22.893 --> 12:24.527
Like, we can't be sure
the Chinese don't know

12:24.595 --> 12:26.228
their fronts have been detained.

12:26.296 --> 12:28.931
Or the fronts themselves
may be feeding us bad intel.

12:35.372 --> 12:37.073
The prudent move would
be to not

12:37.140 --> 12:39.442
answer this, right?
Yup.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.612
We're not gonna make
that move, are we?

12:42.679 --> 12:43.713
Hello.

12:43.780 --> 12:46.782
Is this Red Rover?

12:46.850 --> 12:48.784
- Do you have the money?
- Do you have the package?

12:48.852 --> 12:52.021
A motorcycle will pull up
to the curb in 15 seconds.

12:52.089 --> 12:53.522
Throw the money in its sidecar.

12:53.590 --> 12:55.825
If it's all there, you will
receive further instructions.

12:55.892 --> 12:57.593
That wasn't the deal.
We need to see the package.

12:57.661 --> 12:59.128
5...4...

12:59.196 --> 13:00.796
We're doing this, right?

13:00.864 --> 13:04.533
3...2...1...

13:07.170 --> 13:08.604
All right,
the drop's been made.

13:08.672 --> 13:09.805
Now what?

13:12.442 --> 13:13.643
I think
we just got played.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.445
What about the bike?

13:16.513 --> 13:20.983
The license plate
was blacked out.

13:22.953 --> 13:24.887
Congratulations.
We have a deal.

13:24.955 --> 13:26.088
Where's the package?

13:26.156 --> 13:27.256
Check under the phone.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.130
Nice doing business with you.

13:34.197 --> 13:35.831
Tell me we got it.

13:35.899 --> 13:40.236
I. It looks like we do.

13:40.303 --> 13:44.340
All's well that ends well.

13:51.688 --> 13:52.888
I gotta tell you,

13:52.956 --> 13:55.691
I imagined a more romantic
honeymoon, Mr. Quinn.

13:55.759 --> 13:57.927
You turned our bed into
a work station.

13:57.995 --> 13:59.362
Uhhuh.

13:59.429 --> 14:01.931
You could have at least
carried me across the threshold.

14:01.999 --> 14:03.566
Our flight doesn't leave
for four hours.

14:03.633 --> 14:06.202
I need some privacy
to run these diagnostics.

14:06.269 --> 14:08.104
Are you even listening to me?

14:08.171 --> 14:10.072
Well, you asked why we're here
in the safe house, didn't you?

14:10.140 --> 14:13.175
No, I didn't.

14:13.243 --> 14:15.177
Oh.

14:15.245 --> 14:18.547
First thing a guy does
as soon as he gets married?

14:18.615 --> 14:19.782
Stop listening.

14:19.850 --> 14:21.684
Or so I'm told.

14:21.752 --> 14:23.085
How much more time do you need?

14:23.153 --> 14:25.988
Um, 10, 15 more minutes--
come here.

14:26.056 --> 14:28.524
You gotta check this out.

14:28.592 --> 14:29.725
What am I looking at?

14:29.793 --> 14:30.893
Poetry.

14:30.961 --> 14:32.528
No, actually, I take that back.

14:32.596 --> 14:33.929
It's more like sheet music.

14:33.997 --> 14:35.131
Red Rover is using
the basic building blocks

14:35.198 --> 14:36.332
of the Stuxnet virus,

14:36.400 --> 14:38.000
but this thing's got
so much more soul.

14:38.068 --> 14:40.069
It's got melody.

14:40.137 --> 14:42.171
I have to take
your word for it.

14:42.239 --> 14:44.306
Zeroday attacks.
Man-in-the-middle attacks.

14:44.374 --> 14:45.941
Modular, sophisticated--

14:46.009 --> 14:49.078
it's like Miles in his
<i>Kind of Blue</i> period.

14:49.146 --> 14:53.282
You should've told me you were
such a dork when you proposed.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.619
I might've said no.

14:56.686 --> 14:58.954
Whatever you say, dear.

15:04.027 --> 15:05.661
I think the Chinese
know what we did.

15:05.729 --> 15:06.862
That's impossible.

15:06.930 --> 15:08.064
The Spanish separated
the Quinns,

15:08.131 --> 15:09.532
denied them access
to communication.

15:09.599 --> 15:11.700
This just came in from Spain.
Three MSS operatives

15:11.768 --> 15:14.203
were just spotted at El Prat
an hour ago.

15:14.271 --> 15:17.440
Rebecca.

15:17.507 --> 15:21.544
Get me Nestor Campos
at the C.N.I.

15:21.611 --> 15:23.179
Annie and Auggie,
what's their status?

15:23.246 --> 15:26.082
They've secured the package.
They're on the next flight home.

15:26.149 --> 15:27.483
I don't understand
why you were so eager

15:27.551 --> 15:28.951
to give Auggie the ball
on this one.

15:29.019 --> 15:30.986
Why, you think
he's not qualified?

15:31.054 --> 15:32.922
Is this about me taking Auggie
away from you

15:32.989 --> 15:34.123
and moving him to the O.S.P.?

15:34.191 --> 15:35.858
Because I have
got bigger fish to fry

15:35.926 --> 15:38.994
at the moment than to be playing
these passive-aggressive games.

15:39.062 --> 15:41.997
How did you get
these photos so fast?

15:42.065 --> 15:43.732
I was in the middle of a
drill-down on the Iberian desk.

15:43.800 --> 15:44.867
It came up.

15:44.935 --> 15:48.037
So, just, good timing?

15:48.105 --> 15:51.540
You are micromanaging this op,
Arthur.

15:51.608 --> 15:52.808
Auggie's out of pocket
for a couple of days

15:52.876 --> 15:54.643
and you're climbing the walls?

15:54.711 --> 15:57.179
What else have
you tasked him with?

15:57.247 --> 16:01.383
Campos, line three.

16:07.858 --> 16:10.045
Nestor, what have you got?

16:13.864 --> 16:15.431
- You done?
- Yeah.

16:15.499 --> 16:18.100
Almost, just running
one last test.

16:18.168 --> 16:19.935
Hey, listen--

16:20.003 --> 16:22.238
that dork comment that
you made about me earlier.

16:22.305 --> 16:24.373
Did you mean that?

16:24.441 --> 16:29.311
Come on, we both know you have
certain dork-like qualities.

16:29.379 --> 16:32.014
No, that's not--

16:32.082 --> 16:33.315
I meant the part
about where you said

16:33.383 --> 16:35.417
you wouldn't marry me
because of it.

16:35.485 --> 16:37.953
Did you mean that?

16:38.021 --> 16:39.755
- I'm confused.
- About what?

16:39.823 --> 16:43.359
Is this you, Auggie Anderson,
asking me,

16:43.426 --> 16:45.728
or are you Mr. Kenneth Quinn?

16:45.795 --> 16:46.862
Does it matter?

16:46.930 --> 16:47.997
Well, I'm just trying
to figure out

16:48.064 --> 16:49.131
where this is coming from.

16:49.199 --> 16:55.137
I'm gonna ask Parker
to marry me.

16:59.009 --> 17:01.410
When?

17:01.478 --> 17:04.680
As soon as possible.

17:04.748 --> 17:06.781
I was gonna go
to Eritrea last night,

17:06.849 --> 17:09.785
but this mission kind of...

17:09.853 --> 17:13.756
changed my plans.

17:13.823 --> 17:16.525
I bought the ring four days ago.

17:16.593 --> 17:19.361
Been carrying
it around ever since.

17:19.429 --> 17:24.066
Haven't shown it to anybody yet.

17:24.134 --> 17:25.768
How long have
you been dating her?

17:25.835 --> 17:28.170
What do you mean?

17:28.238 --> 17:31.674
Oh, yeah, I guess we haven't
talked about this much, have we?

17:31.741 --> 17:33.008
Um, about three--four months.

17:33.076 --> 17:35.544
Mm, and most of that's
been long-distance, right?

17:35.612 --> 17:37.713
Yeah.

17:37.781 --> 17:40.216
What did she say when you read
her in on who you work for?

17:40.283 --> 17:42.284
Well, she didn't say anything.
I haven't read her in yet.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.319
Auggie!

17:43.386 --> 17:46.922
Annie, I know what I'm doing.

17:46.990 --> 17:48.924
Don't roll your eyes at me.

17:48.992 --> 17:52.628
I can hear them spinning
from here.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.964
You think this is a reaction
to what happened to Jai?

17:55.031 --> 17:58.234
Maybe it is.

17:58.301 --> 18:01.770
And if it is, I'm okay with it.

18:01.838 --> 18:04.006
One of our own got blown up
by a bomb.

18:04.074 --> 18:06.942
Life is too short not to react
to something like that.

18:15.151 --> 18:16.685
It's Joan.

18:16.753 --> 18:18.153
Hello?
What's your 20?

18:18.221 --> 18:19.588
We're about to leave
for the airport, why?

18:19.656 --> 18:21.490
There's a new development
on the ground over there.

18:21.558 --> 18:22.958
The Canadians that
were rounded up?

18:23.026 --> 18:25.261
They've just been
found murdered.

18:25.328 --> 18:27.029
They were supposed
to be in custody.

18:27.097 --> 18:29.064
They were, in different
facilities, even.

18:29.132 --> 18:32.134
There were two separate security
breaches coordinated perfectly.

18:32.202 --> 18:33.969
It's no longer safe
for you in Barcelona.

18:34.037 --> 18:35.170
Understood.

18:35.238 --> 18:37.439
What's going on?

18:37.507 --> 18:42.278
We gotta get out of here.

19:57.554 --> 19:58.487
Gun!

20:01.358 --> 20:03.025
- Unh!
- Ugh!

20:06.963 --> 20:07.996
On your left!

20:08.064 --> 20:10.099
Ooh!

20:10.166 --> 20:12.000
Oh! Unh!

20:12.068 --> 20:14.002
Ow!

20:14.070 --> 20:16.138
Oh! Ow!

20:32.756 --> 20:34.757
Stairs.
Uh, take my arm.

20:34.824 --> 20:36.024
No, I can do this faster
on my own.

20:36.092 --> 20:37.793
What? I'm not leaving
you behind.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.328
Run point,
clear the floors below.

20:39.396 --> 20:40.429
Go.

20:44.768 --> 20:46.802
Clear.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.607
Clear!

20:55.678 --> 20:56.879
Clear!

21:08.124 --> 21:09.758
Oh!

21:19.903 --> 21:22.337
Got it!

21:43.793 --> 21:46.562
Damn it!

21:50.900 --> 21:52.167
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

21:52.235 --> 21:53.168
Yeah.

21:53.236 --> 21:54.436
I dropped the case.

21:54.504 --> 21:55.637
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay.

21:55.705 --> 21:58.707
It's okay.

22:04.030 --> 22:06.776
The virus is based
off of the tilded platform.

22:06.924 --> 22:09.725
I couldn't tell what it was
designed to target specifically,

22:09.793 --> 22:12.194
but I'm guessing
a SCADA system of some sort,

22:12.262 --> 22:13.829
probably U.S.-based.

22:13.897 --> 22:15.965
So what kind of damage
are we talking about here?

22:16.033 --> 22:17.633
It depends on the target.
It could off-line

22:17.701 --> 22:20.102
whole manufacturing runs,
weapons programs.

22:20.170 --> 22:21.904
Maybe tap into
our network backbone.

22:21.972 --> 22:24.206
Joan, it's gonna cause
a lot of hurt.

22:24.274 --> 22:25.641
We have to intercept this thing

22:25.709 --> 22:27.343
before the Chinese
put it into play.

22:27.411 --> 22:28.878
There's no getting
the package back now.

22:28.946 --> 22:30.146
Not without an army.

22:30.213 --> 22:32.581
It's probably on a plane
to Beijing as we speak.

22:32.649 --> 22:34.050
I'm not suggesting
we go after the package.

22:34.117 --> 22:37.486
What I'm saying is we need
to find Red Rover and turn him.

22:37.554 --> 22:39.989
He's the only one who'll know
how to counter this virus.

22:40.057 --> 22:40.990
You've I.D.'d Red Rover?

22:41.058 --> 22:42.191
- No.
- Yes.

22:42.259 --> 22:43.859
I'm sorry?

22:43.927 --> 22:45.861
Is that a yes or a no?

22:45.929 --> 22:47.830
No, we haven't
positively I.D.'d him.

22:47.898 --> 22:50.833
I worked up a profile.
Based on what?

22:50.901 --> 22:51.968
Hello.

22:52.035 --> 22:55.071
Based on what?

22:55.138 --> 22:56.372
Joan, we got a bargain
with this virus.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.307
Red Rover could have
sold it for a lot more.

22:58.375 --> 23:00.843
So, you're saying he's
not motivated by money.

23:00.911 --> 23:02.111
Perhaps.

23:02.179 --> 23:03.479
Maybe he doesn't know
how talented he is.

23:03.547 --> 23:05.881
But he's held on
to his anonymity,

23:05.949 --> 23:07.216
so maybe he's the sort of person

23:07.284 --> 23:08.918
who will respond
to being recognized.

23:08.986 --> 23:11.787
Annie, do you think we have
the bandwidth to pull this off?

23:11.855 --> 23:13.255
On the ground? Now?

23:13.323 --> 23:14.690
We still have to find Red Rover.

23:14.758 --> 23:16.225
We can question the waitress.

23:16.293 --> 23:17.994
- What waitress?
- At the cafe.

23:18.061 --> 23:19.595
She might have
a description of the guy

23:19.663 --> 23:22.064
who passed her the note.
It's worth a shot.

23:22.132 --> 23:24.233
No, that's not a shot, Auggie.
That's a shot in the dark.

23:24.301 --> 23:27.103
- But, Joan, I--
- Look, guys, this is on me.

23:27.170 --> 23:29.205
I sent you in there
with faulty intel,

23:29.272 --> 23:30.873
and without adequate support.

23:30.941 --> 23:33.009
Let's not compound
the error, okay?

23:33.076 --> 23:34.443
I want you to get on a plane,

23:34.511 --> 23:38.447
and come back home.

23:51.995 --> 23:53.796
They said the food was
the worst the thing about prison,

23:53.864 --> 23:54.930
but they were wrong.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.135
It's the golf.

23:59.202 --> 24:01.237
They don't take care
of their greens at all.

24:05.575 --> 24:08.244
I wanted to extend
my condolences on your loss.

24:08.311 --> 24:10.646
You came all the way
out here just to tell me that?

24:10.714 --> 24:11.714
I know we've had
our differences,

24:11.782 --> 24:13.916
but Jai was still part
of our family.

24:13.984 --> 24:17.286
A mountain climbing accident,
huh?

24:17.354 --> 24:19.422
What did you tell everyone
happened with his car?

24:19.489 --> 24:21.524
Fuel line defect.

24:21.591 --> 24:26.762
And people bought that?

24:26.830 --> 24:28.464
I don't know why I'm surprised.

24:28.532 --> 24:32.868
Perhaps because
I'm still in shock.

24:32.936 --> 24:34.270
I wanted to attend the service,

24:34.337 --> 24:38.074
but somebody must have
considered me a flight risk.

24:38.141 --> 24:39.375
I suppose I should be flattered.

24:39.443 --> 24:43.145
Oh, I'm sorry
you couldn't attend, Henry.

24:43.213 --> 24:47.083
It was a fine service.
Very dignified.

24:47.150 --> 24:52.154
I can still see him walking
into work the first day.

24:54.424 --> 24:56.292
Chalk-striped suit, red tie.

24:56.359 --> 24:58.527
And those shoes.

24:58.595 --> 25:00.896
He must have stayed up
all night polishing them.

25:00.964 --> 25:03.399
He will be remembered.

25:03.467 --> 25:05.067
I understand you've
had some visitors recently.

25:05.135 --> 25:07.203
Investigators from
the task force.

25:07.270 --> 25:08.504
You mean the buzzards.

25:08.572 --> 25:10.973
I heard you weren't
cooperating.

25:11.041 --> 25:13.909
- Now it is revealed.
- What?

25:13.977 --> 25:15.644
Why you came.
You have an agenda.

25:15.712 --> 25:17.012
Oh, I didn't have an agenda.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.015
Please! The decision
to stick you behind a desk,

25:20.083 --> 25:23.819
reclassify you as overt,

25:23.887 --> 25:26.422
that was mine.

25:26.490 --> 25:27.923
You made a horrible spy.

25:27.991 --> 25:30.092
Your eyes give too much away.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.661
I'm imploring you, Henry.

25:32.729 --> 25:33.929
Please sit down with--

25:33.997 --> 25:39.301
I wasn't allowed out
for the funeral.

25:39.369 --> 25:43.672
My own son.

25:43.740 --> 25:45.508
After 30 years of service.

25:45.575 --> 25:47.309
So you're not cooperating.
Why?

25:47.377 --> 25:49.345
To get payback?

25:49.412 --> 25:52.548
You know how opinion
is shaped, Henry.

25:52.616 --> 25:55.217
Your intransigence is fueling
speculation that you might have

25:55.285 --> 25:57.753
been involved somehow
in the bombing.

25:57.821 --> 26:01.090
People think I murdered
my own son?

26:01.158 --> 26:06.228
What motive? Revenge?

26:06.296 --> 26:11.167
Do people think I'm capable
of something so horrific?

26:11.234 --> 26:12.635
And what do you think?

26:12.702 --> 26:15.204
Oh, I'd like to believe
you had nothing to do with it.

26:15.272 --> 26:16.805
But every time I thought

26:16.873 --> 26:19.508
you couldn't possibly
sink any lower,

26:19.576 --> 26:23.379
you proved me wrong.

26:23.446 --> 26:26.048
I brought you into the Agency.

26:26.116 --> 26:27.316
I made you.

26:27.384 --> 26:29.585
You were supposed to be
my trusted Lieutenant.

26:29.653 --> 26:31.320
My protege.

26:31.388 --> 26:34.290
And the whole time you were
stabbing me in the back.

26:34.357 --> 26:37.426
That's not an accurate record
of what transpired.

26:37.494 --> 26:39.628
My son was assassinated.

26:39.696 --> 26:43.666
Right here, in our own backyard.

26:43.733 --> 26:48.837
You shouldn't have held yourself
up as a--a--a mentor,

26:48.905 --> 26:50.873
or a guardian,

26:50.941 --> 26:55.277
if you couldn't follow through
and protect your charges.

26:55.345 --> 27:00.182
You want to search someone's
hand for Jai's blood?

27:00.250 --> 27:02.885
Search yours.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.660
I see a cabstand ahead.

27:11.728 --> 27:13.495
I can't believe you're pulling
the ripcord.

27:13.563 --> 27:15.164
That was Joan's call,
not mine.

27:15.232 --> 27:16.265
Because you put it
in her head.

27:16.333 --> 27:17.333
We don't have the bandwidth?

27:17.400 --> 27:18.434
We don't!

27:18.501 --> 27:20.269
We are outnumbered
and outflanked.

27:20.337 --> 27:22.738
Since day one you have been
bucking Joan's authority

27:22.806 --> 27:25.908
like it is a source of pride,
and now all of a sudden

27:25.976 --> 27:29.011
you salute and fall in lockstep.

27:29.079 --> 27:30.346
It's because of me, isn't it?

27:30.413 --> 27:31.780
You think I'm some sort
of a burden.

27:31.848 --> 27:33.148
I do not think that,
of course not.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.384
Then why did you come back
up the stairs to help me?

27:35.452 --> 27:36.819
'Cause you were down.

27:36.886 --> 27:39.021
You should have gone
for the package.

27:39.089 --> 27:40.923
'Cause that was our mission.

27:40.991 --> 27:44.793
To get the package home,
not to help me.

27:44.861 --> 27:47.129
I don't want to go back
to the way things were.

27:47.197 --> 27:48.864
I don't want to get
stuck behind my desk.

27:48.932 --> 27:51.267
I want to move forward
with my life,

27:51.334 --> 27:55.437
across the board, but I don't
have a Lena in my corner.

27:55.505 --> 27:57.506
My only champion is Joan.

27:57.574 --> 27:59.008
If I disappoint her--

27:59.075 --> 28:01.043
You won't disappoint her.
She wants us to follow orders.

28:01.111 --> 28:02.211
She wants us to come home.

28:02.279 --> 28:04.280
Come on, Annie,
she wants a win.

28:04.347 --> 28:05.481
And so do I.

28:09.152 --> 28:13.989
Aah, I have to take this.

28:14.057 --> 28:15.324
Hello, yes?

28:15.392 --> 28:16.692
Question for you.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.395
Have you boarded your flight
back stateside yet?

28:19.462 --> 28:20.829
- No, not yet.
- Good.

28:20.897 --> 28:22.631
I might have a change
of itinerary for you.

28:22.699 --> 28:25.301
We traced Simon to Munich.
He's staying at the Konigshof.

28:25.368 --> 28:26.902
You want me to stop by?

28:26.970 --> 28:28.671
Why not? Spur of the moment,

28:28.738 --> 28:29.838
throw caution to the wind.

28:29.906 --> 28:32.174
You've got that gear.

28:32.242 --> 28:34.376
How did you trace Simon?
Fro--from the sweep drive?

28:34.444 --> 28:36.245
No, the sweep drive
was a cropper.

28:36.313 --> 28:37.780
Nothing of real value on it.

28:37.847 --> 28:38.914
But we have other sources.

28:38.982 --> 28:41.183
Wait, the drive
came up with nothing?

28:41.251 --> 28:42.217
Well, you said it yourself.

28:42.285 --> 28:43.319
Anything you could
get that easily

28:43.386 --> 28:45.254
was probably not worth getting.

28:45.322 --> 28:46.622
Yeah, uh--

28:46.690 --> 28:48.457
Besides, do you really need
a sweep drive?

28:48.525 --> 28:51.694
Get intimate enough with a man
and he'll tell you everything.

28:51.761 --> 28:53.462
So, can I book you a flight?

28:53.530 --> 28:55.764
Actually, I'm not sure
when I can wrap this up.

28:55.832 --> 28:58.133
Joan promised me you'd be done
by the end of the day.

28:58.201 --> 28:59.401
Just hop over to Munich then.

28:59.469 --> 29:02.571
I will do my best.
Lena, um...

29:02.639 --> 29:08.010
Let me get back to you.

29:14.084 --> 29:18.020
Auggie!

29:34.108 --> 29:35.441
- Hola.
- Hola.

29:35.509 --> 29:36.743
I don't know
if you remember me.

29:36.810 --> 29:39.045
I was her earlier, and
I forgot to tip my waitress.

29:39.113 --> 29:40.780
She's, like, um, 20-something,

29:40.848 --> 29:42.382
dark hair,
kind of spectacular looking.

29:42.449 --> 29:44.784
- Pilar.
- Pilar, yes. Is she here?

29:44.852 --> 29:46.986
- No.
- Oh.

29:47.054 --> 29:49.289
Um, could I leave her some cash,
'cause I feel kind of horrible.

29:49.356 --> 29:51.291
Yeah, of course.

29:53.861 --> 29:55.862
You Americans love to tip.

29:55.930 --> 29:58.831
Another one was here ten minutes
ago for the same thing.

29:58.899 --> 30:01.267
- That's a coincidence.
- Yeah.

30:01.335 --> 30:03.236
Um, what did you say
her name was again?

30:03.304 --> 30:04.370
Pilar. Pilar Sastre.

30:04.438 --> 30:05.438
Sastre?

30:12.580 --> 30:14.647
Ten minutes behind.

30:14.715 --> 30:17.817
Thought I taught you
better than that.

30:17.885 --> 30:20.587
You thought wrong.

30:20.654 --> 30:24.424
Well, it's not the first thing
I got wrong today.

30:24.491 --> 30:27.126
Listen, I, uh...

30:27.194 --> 30:28.261
I feel like I should--

30:28.329 --> 30:29.762
You don't need to.
You were right.

30:29.830 --> 30:34.300
I was being overly cautious
and overly protective.

30:34.368 --> 30:35.835
I already lost
one friend this week,

30:35.903 --> 30:40.106
I didn't want to lose
my best one on top of that.

30:40.174 --> 30:43.274
So we're besties.

30:50.751 --> 30:53.686
Well, we had our first fight..

30:53.754 --> 30:58.458
Now we're like
a real married couple.

31:00.628 --> 31:03.963
- Did you check the apartment?
- I knocked, nobody answered.

31:04.031 --> 31:05.765
The manager didn't give you
the actual address, did he?

31:05.833 --> 31:06.766
No.

31:06.834 --> 31:08.868
I called in a favor.

31:08.936 --> 31:10.203
I cross-checked
her D.N.I. number

31:10.271 --> 31:11.471
with the Spanish
tax authorities.

31:11.538 --> 31:13.439
You?
Phone book.

31:13.507 --> 31:16.309
Oh. Well, I didn't
have that option.

31:16.377 --> 31:17.377
Come on.

31:17.444 --> 31:19.579
- What is it?
- Here she comes.

31:19.647 --> 31:22.682
I hope you're right.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.217
Excuse me.
I don't know if you remember us

31:24.285 --> 31:25.752
from the restaurant
earlier today?

31:25.819 --> 31:27.620
No, sorry, I don't.

31:30.324 --> 31:31.624
We sat in your section.

31:31.692 --> 31:33.459
You passed us a note.
I'm not interested.

31:33.527 --> 31:35.094
Listen, uh--

31:35.162 --> 31:36.496
<i>Gilipollas!</i> What do you think
you're doing, huh?

31:36.563 --> 31:39.732
Pilar, we just want to ask you
a couple of questions.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.335
Oh, so you know, I have
1 million volts at my disposal,

31:42.403 --> 31:46.939
and I have no fear
to use all of them.

31:47.007 --> 31:48.207
We're not here to hurt you.

31:48.275 --> 31:49.409
You don't say.

32:10.431 --> 32:12.098
Look, we just want to know
if you remember anything about

32:12.166 --> 32:14.200
the guy at the restaurant
who gave you the note.

32:14.268 --> 32:15.835
Nope.

32:17.705 --> 32:21.274
Look, I'm letting you in,
but don't mess with my shit.

32:21.342 --> 32:23.876
What's that humming sound?

32:23.944 --> 32:27.213
I don't know how to describe
exactly what I'm seeing.

32:27.281 --> 32:29.015
No need.

32:29.083 --> 32:31.217
I'm already there.

32:31.285 --> 32:32.752
If you came
to get your money back,

32:32.820 --> 32:34.020
too bad, no refunds.

32:34.088 --> 32:36.789
No, no, we didn't come
for your money...

32:36.857 --> 32:38.791
Red Rover.

32:38.859 --> 32:40.626
We came for you.

32:42.896 --> 32:45.264
They're still not picking up.

32:45.332 --> 32:47.900
Okay, well, um,
just keep trying.

32:47.968 --> 32:50.503
Both of them.

32:50.571 --> 32:52.605
Hey. Got a minute?

32:52.673 --> 32:54.574
For you, Paul, I've got two.

32:54.641 --> 32:56.676
Well, I'll only need the one.
I don't have much time.

32:56.744 --> 32:58.444
I just slipped away from
a J.S.E.C. meeting.

32:58.512 --> 33:00.580
Oh, so it's gonna be
one of those kind of minutes.

33:00.647 --> 33:01.714
Yeah, I'm afraid so.!

33:01.782 --> 33:03.216
I feel like every time
I see you,

33:03.283 --> 33:04.984
it's because I've been
eavesdropping on your husband.

33:05.052 --> 33:06.419
Why would you
be eavesdropping on Arthur?

33:06.487 --> 33:08.154
Well, you know the N.S.A.
is part of the task force

33:08.222 --> 33:09.422
investigating Jai's murder,
right?

33:09.490 --> 33:11.224
- I assumed it would be.
- Yeah, well, I've been

33:11.291 --> 33:12.492
running point.

33:12.559 --> 33:14.894
Combing through hours of
recorded phone conversations

33:14.962 --> 33:17.597
and emails, all signed off
on by F.I.S.A., of course.

33:17.664 --> 33:18.731
Of course.

33:18.799 --> 33:20.466
Yeah, well,
the upshot's this.

33:20.534 --> 33:22.168
In the weeks
leading up to his death,

33:22.236 --> 33:24.137
a private security firm had
been hired to tail Jai,

33:24.204 --> 33:25.772
and Arthur was the one
doing the hiring,

33:25.839 --> 33:27.807
from a private account.

33:27.875 --> 33:32.412
Now, did you know
anything about this?

33:32.479 --> 33:34.313
I came to you as a friend, Joan.

33:34.381 --> 33:39.519
I can't have any
of this coming back to me.

33:39.586 --> 33:40.753
Who else knows about this?

33:40.821 --> 33:43.122
Today? Just me and you.

33:43.190 --> 33:44.957
But next week?

33:45.025 --> 33:49.929
I don't know how wide
it's gonna get.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.435
♪

33:55.502 --> 33:58.638
Not exactly
a jazz aficionado.

33:58.705 --> 33:59.705
In case you haven't figured
it out by now,

33:59.773 --> 34:02.408
your profile was
about 100% wrong.

34:02.476 --> 34:03.943
I'm gonna turn this girl.
Watch me.

34:04.011 --> 34:05.211
Sorry.

34:05.279 --> 34:07.447
The music helps chill me out
when I get stressed.

34:07.514 --> 34:09.614
No, that's okay.

34:09.683 --> 34:11.284
It's catchy.

34:11.351 --> 34:12.819
You guys want a beer?

34:12.886 --> 34:16.789
Uh, no, thank you.
We're okay.

34:19.493 --> 34:20.760
What are you doing?

34:20.828 --> 34:22.495
I wanted to see
if he really was blind.

34:22.563 --> 34:24.764
I really am blind.

34:24.831 --> 34:27.132
So, how much trouble I am in?

34:27.201 --> 34:30.069
Well, you just sold a virus
on the black market.

34:30.137 --> 34:32.938
Add to that you taking down
Telecom-Orange last Christmas--

34:33.005 --> 34:34.306
You guys know about that?

34:34.373 --> 34:36.309
I thought you weren't involved
in law enforcement.

34:36.376 --> 34:37.777
We're not.

34:37.844 --> 34:40.580
But I'm sure Interpol would be
happy to finally I.D. you.

34:40.647 --> 34:42.681
<i>Hostia.</i>

34:42.748 --> 34:44.851
I knew something wasn't
right about you two.

34:44.918 --> 34:46.686
You were supposed
to be Canadian.

34:46.753 --> 34:48.855
Why did you target the U.S.
with your virus, Pilar?

34:48.922 --> 34:50.489
It's what they asked me to do.

34:50.556 --> 34:52.859
I was just happy
someone noticed me.

34:52.926 --> 34:56.862
Look, I'm not out to upend
the world or anything.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.364
It's not why I got into this.

34:58.432 --> 35:00.366
Why did you get into it?

35:00.434 --> 35:02.568
Because my boyfriend
was into it.

35:02.636 --> 35:05.505
I thought he'd be happy,
but nope.

35:05.572 --> 35:08.007
He got jealous and hooked up
with some gamer girl

35:08.075 --> 35:09.375
he met online.

35:09.443 --> 35:12.211
I guess I wanted to show him
he made a mistake.

35:15.415 --> 35:19.619
Excuse my reach.

35:19.686 --> 35:21.153
What's going on?

35:21.221 --> 35:22.388
Nothing.

35:22.456 --> 35:27.159
Listen, I don't know
if you know this or not,

35:27.227 --> 35:29.262
but you're an extremely
talented programmer.

35:29.329 --> 35:30.763
Leet, even.

35:30.831 --> 35:33.332
Leet? I don't know about that.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.201
No, you are.

35:35.269 --> 35:36.602
You're one of the best
I've seen.

35:38.005 --> 35:41.874
Now, I'm assuming
you can disarm that malware.

35:41.942 --> 35:44.076
Well, I designed it, so--yeah.

35:44.144 --> 35:45.411
Good.

35:45.479 --> 35:48.014
Then come with us.
Design the antivirus.

35:48.081 --> 35:49.348
- And then?
- Who knows?

35:49.416 --> 35:53.085
We could certainly use someone
of your talents.

35:53.153 --> 35:54.353
I don't know.
I never thought of myself

35:54.421 --> 35:56.222
as someone who would work
for the CIA.

35:56.290 --> 35:57.557
You're a natural.

35:57.624 --> 35:59.191
That exchange that
you orchestrated?

35:59.259 --> 36:01.727
It seemed like
a professional did it.

36:01.795 --> 36:03.996
How did you insert yourself
into the cafe?

36:04.064 --> 36:06.098
I used to work there.

36:06.166 --> 36:08.267
I have the manager wrapped
around my finger.

36:08.335 --> 36:10.336
He lets me pick up shifts
whenever I want.

36:10.404 --> 36:12.138
It's a good cover.

36:12.205 --> 36:13.839
"Good cover," you already
have the lingo.

36:13.907 --> 36:16.409
Look, I used to be
a lot like you.

36:16.476 --> 36:19.745
Angry, lost, and looking
to tear things down.

36:19.813 --> 36:23.583
But trust me, it is more
rewarding to build things up.

36:23.650 --> 36:25.885
Come with us. Help us.

36:25.953 --> 36:30.523
It'll change your life.

36:30.591 --> 36:34.994
This is a lot to process.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.696
Can I ask you a question first?

36:36.763 --> 36:39.298
Anything.

36:39.366 --> 36:41.867
Why do you guys suck
so much, huh?

36:44.004 --> 36:46.439
Does this "build things up"
speech actually

36:46.506 --> 36:48.608
work with anyone?

36:54.214 --> 36:55.982
We'll double the money
we already paid you

36:56.049 --> 36:57.617
if you come and design
the antivirus.

36:57.684 --> 36:59.285
Triple it,
and I'm all yours.

36:59.353 --> 37:01.220
Done.
You've got five minutes.

37:01.288 --> 37:03.889
Pack a bag, anything you need.

37:03.957 --> 37:07.727
Passport, computer, whatever.

37:07.794 --> 37:09.462
Assume you're not coming back.

37:09.529 --> 37:12.665
I'm ready to go.

37:12.733 --> 37:15.668
Now, how about you tell
your goons to stand down, huh?

37:15.736 --> 37:17.269
What goons?

37:20.774 --> 37:23.175
Is there another way
out of this place?

37:28.059 --> 37:30.059
Come on.

37:32.957 --> 37:36.493
Go. Go!

37:56.014 --> 38:00.417
He's coming back
for another pass.

38:06.691 --> 38:09.393
Where's Pilar?

38:09.461 --> 38:13.697
- I don't know.
- Annie, we can't lose her.

38:13.765 --> 38:15.466
Here she comes.

38:18.103 --> 38:21.272
- Get in.
- Let's go!

38:24.676 --> 38:26.443
Hang on!

38:46.331 --> 38:47.731
It's one thing
to breach protocol

38:47.799 --> 38:49.166
when you're reporting
to me directly,

38:49.234 --> 38:51.468
but it's another thing entirely
under these circumstances.

38:51.536 --> 38:55.339
I still cannot believe
you people fly commercial.

38:55.407 --> 38:56.640
- Who's this?
- Pilar.

38:56.708 --> 38:59.109
This is your new handler,
Joan Campbell.

38:59.177 --> 39:01.578
Joan, this is Pilar Sastre,

39:01.646 --> 39:04.281
also known as Red Rover.

39:04.349 --> 39:06.083
You're my handler?

39:06.151 --> 39:08.018
I slept on the flight over,

39:08.086 --> 39:10.621
so don't worry about me
needing any rest.

39:10.689 --> 39:13.924
Now let me tell you what
I'm gonna need from you, okay?

39:13.992 --> 39:15.359
A quad-core laptop

39:15.427 --> 39:17.928
as much ram as will fit...

39:17.996 --> 39:20.064
They make an interesting pair.

39:20.131 --> 39:21.832
I'm not sure who
I'm more afraid for.

39:21.900 --> 39:24.668
- Joan.
- Yeah, definitely, Joan.

39:24.736 --> 39:26.070
All right, listen.

39:26.137 --> 39:29.640
I have to admit, my radar was
a little off on this one.

39:29.708 --> 39:30.974
You know what
I like about you?

39:31.042 --> 39:33.410
Just one thing?

39:33.478 --> 39:34.912
Your positivity.

39:34.979 --> 39:38.182
You see the best in people
until they prove you wrong.

39:38.249 --> 39:39.883
That makes me a chump.

39:39.951 --> 39:43.053
That makes you a romantic.

39:43.121 --> 39:45.556
And a little bit of a chump.

39:45.623 --> 39:46.957
You want a ride home?

39:47.025 --> 39:48.092
Uh, no, thank you.

39:48.159 --> 39:49.093
But you can point me
in the direction

39:49.160 --> 39:50.361
of the ticket counter.

39:50.428 --> 39:54.331
I'm catching the first flight
back to Eritrea.

39:58.336 --> 40:01.905
So you can propose?

40:01.973 --> 40:04.475
Yeah.

40:04.542 --> 40:06.143
It was good practice being
married to you for a day.

40:06.211 --> 40:11.014
I promise I won't
contest the divorce.

40:11.082 --> 40:12.316
This is crazy.
It's crazy, right?

40:12.384 --> 40:14.351
To buy an engagement ring
literally blind.

40:14.419 --> 40:16.653
It could be horrendous.

40:16.721 --> 40:18.956
You want me to take a look,
just to make sure?

40:19.023 --> 40:21.792
Please.

40:27.432 --> 40:28.699
I couldn't go
the traditional route,

40:28.767 --> 40:29.867
'cause of
the blood diamond trade,

40:29.934 --> 40:34.204
so I thought she'd like this.

40:34.272 --> 40:37.341
It's beautiful.

40:37.409 --> 40:40.577
If she doesn't like it...

40:40.645 --> 40:46.316
she's not the right girl.

40:46.384 --> 40:49.153
Thank you.

40:49.220 --> 40:52.823
For everything.

40:52.891 --> 40:55.726
Yeah.
