01:44.440 --> 01:46.727
"Booby Traps"?

02:09.639 --> 02:12.644
There you are, my lovely.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.361
What's that?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.086
Take the book?

02:28.320 --> 02:29.560
I don't mind if I do.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.688
At last, it is mine.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.406
Finally, you are mine.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.405
All right. Let's do this. Bare knuckles.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.722
Bring it on, skinny. You don't scare me.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.500
You got any sevens?

02:59.600 --> 03:01.090
Go fish.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.285
Is that all you got?

03:35.360 --> 03:37.806
Man, this is way overdue.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.540
"Once upon a time, under the sea,

03:43.640 --> 03:46.820
"there was a little town
called Bikini Bottom.

03:46.920 --> 03:50.540
"In this town, there was a place
called The Krusty Krab,

03:50.640 --> 03:54.645
"where folks would come to eat a thing
called the Krabby Patty.

03:55.280 --> 03:58.727
"Every greasy spoon has a fry cook,
and the one who worked here

03:58.840 --> 04:02.049
"was named SpongeBob SquarePants."

04:03.560 --> 04:05.700
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?

04:05.800 --> 04:07.484
SpongeBob SquarePants!

04:07.600 --> 04:08.660
Absorbent and yellow and porous is he

04:08.760 --> 04:09.740
Just hold it. Hold it.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.540
SpongeBob SquarePants!

04:11.640 --> 04:13.620
If nautical nonsense
be something you wish

04:13.720 --> 04:15.740
SpongeBob SquarePants!

04:15.840 --> 04:17.740
Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish

04:17.839 --> 04:19.841
SpongeBob SquarePants!

04:20.160 --> 04:21.161
Stop!

04:25.200 --> 04:28.363
There's only one thing worse
than talking birds, and that would be...

04:28.520 --> 04:29.620
Singing birds!

04:29.720 --> 04:33.611
Okay, I promise not to si-i-i-ng.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.300
Take it from us.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.926
He really does hate singing birds.

04:40.040 --> 04:42.691
Just keep weading.
Pwease, Mr. Piwate, sir.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.121
Come closer while I tell you the tale.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.807
- Okay, start reading.
- No. Not that close!

04:49.160 --> 04:50.241
Yeah.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.051
All right, here we go.

04:55.200 --> 04:59.046
Now, SpongeBob loved his job
as a fry cook

05:00.080 --> 05:01.809
more than anything.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.281
And that is saying a lot

05:04.560 --> 05:06.881
because he loved everything!

05:07.080 --> 05:09.460
He loved his pet snail, Gary.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.244
He loved his best friend, Patrick.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.328
He loved blowing bubbles

05:16.280 --> 05:18.328
and jellyfishing.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.580
He loved making Krabby Patties
for the folks of Bikini Bottom

05:22.680 --> 05:25.300
just as much as they loved eating them.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.820
Why, you may ask,

05:26.920 --> 05:29.940
do they love this
greasy little sandwich so much?

05:30.040 --> 05:32.361
Why did they eat them for breakfast,

05:32.800 --> 05:33.926
lunch,

05:34.800 --> 05:35.940
and dinner,

05:36.040 --> 05:38.660
despite their doctor's warnings?

05:38.760 --> 05:40.285
He'll be gone in a week.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.721
Oh, Harold!

05:45.560 --> 05:47.130
It was a secret.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.980
No one was sure what was

05:49.080 --> 05:51.660
in these patties
that made them so delicious.

05:51.760 --> 05:53.380
And, frankly, no one cared,

05:53.480 --> 05:55.500
except for Plankton.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.980
Plankton owned a restaurant
right across the street

05:58.080 --> 05:59.220
from The Krusty Krab,

05:59.320 --> 06:02.460
where no one ate
because the food was really bad.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.289
Now, is that really necessary?

06:06.040 --> 06:09.408
Plankton had made it his life's work
to steal the recipe.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.700
SpongeBob, please,
let's talk about this!

06:12.800 --> 06:15.963
And SpongeBob was
always there to protect it.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.807
But today, things

06:20.600 --> 06:22.011
would be different.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.580
Good morning, SpongeBob!

06:25.680 --> 06:26.780
Morning, Patrick!

06:26.880 --> 06:28.660
You here for
your pre-lunch Krabby Patty?

06:28.760 --> 06:30.420
I'm getting two today.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.700
One for me and one for my friend.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.620
Have I met this friend?

06:35.720 --> 06:37.643
"You know me, SpongeBob."

06:40.400 --> 06:42.129
Enjoy, Patrick's tummy.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.766
Thirteen,

06:54.000 --> 06:55.940
fourteen, fifteen...

06:56.040 --> 06:59.408
Hey, Mr. Krabs, I thought we got
our tartar sauce delivery on Thursday.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.726
Tartar...

07:01.840 --> 07:02.900
Sauce?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.411
Bull's-eye!

07:07.920 --> 07:09.001
Plankton!

07:09.120 --> 07:11.691
So it's a food fight he wants, eh?

07:11.920 --> 07:13.460
Welcome to Air Plankton.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.900
Please put your seat backs
and tray tables up

07:16.000 --> 07:18.606
as we're now approaching
our final destination.

07:21.920 --> 07:24.571
Okay, Patrick, load the potatoes!

07:25.080 --> 07:26.540
Mashed or scalloped, sir?

07:26.640 --> 07:28.420
No, Patrick. Raw.

07:28.520 --> 07:29.681
Sir, yes, sir!

07:30.520 --> 07:32.682
Locked and loaded!

07:33.520 --> 07:36.780
Don't worry, little formuler,
you'll be safe in this

07:36.880 --> 07:38.166
safe.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.006
Fire!

07:44.720 --> 07:45.960
Potatoes?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.540
He's closing in!

07:49.640 --> 07:52.723
I think we have a few minutes
before he gets here.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.924
He's right on top of us!

08:00.080 --> 08:02.765
Hey, it's raining fries!

08:03.000 --> 08:06.083
It's gonna take a lot more than
potatoes to bring this baby down.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.281
Or maybe not.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.483
Wait a minute, Patrick, look!
He's got a tank!

08:24.800 --> 08:28.566
Well, Krabs, you're certainly
in a pickle now!

08:39.159 --> 08:41.481
Hey, it's raining pickles!

08:42.799 --> 08:44.164
Now it's raining...

08:45.640 --> 08:47.005
Tanks.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.400
You're welcome!

08:51.960 --> 08:53.291
Finland.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.340
Your orders, sir!

08:59.440 --> 09:02.020
I'll have two
Krabby Patties-extra ketchup,

09:02.120 --> 09:04.327
extra mustard, and hold the mayo.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.726
Wrong channel!

09:05.960 --> 09:07.140
Your orders, sir!

09:07.240 --> 09:10.926
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!
Hold the mayo!

09:11.080 --> 09:12.161
Yes, sir!

09:12.320 --> 09:15.005
Extra ketchup! Extra mustard!

09:15.800 --> 09:18.246
Hold the mayo!

09:19.280 --> 09:20.860
Unleash the condiments!

09:20.960 --> 09:22.610
With relish.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.449
Excuse me.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.161
Hello?

09:42.640 --> 09:43.687
Hello?

09:43.840 --> 09:45.922
- Guess y'all don't want my money.
- Money?

09:46.080 --> 09:47.684
Thank you! Come again!

09:53.840 --> 09:57.208
I can't hold the mayo any longer!

10:02.280 --> 10:06.205
Mayo? Well, it's going to
take a lot more than mayo to stop...

10:11.080 --> 10:12.366
Now what?

10:23.360 --> 10:26.045
I just remembered,
I don't work for Mr. Krabs!

10:27.240 --> 10:28.844
Robot! Robot!

10:29.040 --> 10:31.281
Robot! Giant robot!

10:31.520 --> 10:33.363
Robot! Robot!

10:33.560 --> 10:36.940
Mr. Krabs, Plankton's here
and he's got a giant robot!

10:37.040 --> 10:38.485
Quick, boy, bar the door!

10:38.880 --> 10:40.006
Got it!

10:49.760 --> 10:52.240
I'll take one secret formula

10:53.120 --> 10:54.326
to go.

11:05.600 --> 11:08.251
Oh, barnacles. I'm out of gas?

11:10.920 --> 11:12.820
I'm not through yet.

11:12.920 --> 11:16.740
I've got something that will make
you hand over that formula.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.286
Something you can't resist.

11:21.240 --> 11:22.340
Money!

11:22.440 --> 11:24.010
Yes!

11:24.120 --> 11:27.124
That's... That's... That's impossible!

11:28.160 --> 11:30.527
Well, it was full of money
just last week.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.860
And then I bought that airplane
and built that tank.

11:33.960 --> 11:39.126
Sounds to me like
someone's just a wee bit broke!

11:40.120 --> 11:42.940
Well, Krabs, I guess you've won.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.806
I've spent every penny I've ever made
trying to put you out of business.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.620
Except this one. My last penny.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.610
Besides, what can I do
with one measly cent anyway?

11:54.800 --> 11:56.860
You could give it to me.
Just a suggestion.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.564
Here, take it.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.485
You've taken everything else. Why not?

12:07.800 --> 12:11.220
Well, Plankton,
like a reheated Krabby Patty,

12:11.320 --> 12:13.527
you've been foiled again.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.420
I guess this means the secret formula
is safe forever, right, Mr. Krabs?

12:19.520 --> 12:21.045
It sure does, boy.

12:21.760 --> 12:23.683
Why don't you scurry along?

12:25.680 --> 12:28.411
Thanks for coming! Have a nice day!

12:31.960 --> 12:34.531
He's been out there
crying for 20 minutes.

12:34.760 --> 12:35.900
Pathetic.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.890
I'm just going to
go out there and gloat a little.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.780
Cyclops to Laptop. Come in, Laptop.

12:53.880 --> 12:57.180
"Laptop." You do realize
that nickname is demeaning?

12:57.280 --> 13:00.204
I have twice
the processing power of a laptop.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.125
Never mind. Maintain radio silence.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.686
Finally!

13:11.800 --> 13:14.500
A pressure plate, eh, Krabs?

13:14.600 --> 13:16.090
Amateur hour.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.801
Perfect!

13:25.880 --> 13:27.325
Not a bad likeness.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.220
Good enough to fool that idiot Krabs.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.402
Easy, easy.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.300
Plankton's broke!

13:37.400 --> 13:39.140
Look at Mr. Krabs go.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.242
I've never seen him
gloat this hard before.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.420
Hey, well, Plankton,

13:44.520 --> 13:47.091
me bunions are telling me
it's time to stop gloating.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.687
Looks like you're
falling apart at the seams.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.180
Poor me.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.931
- Sob, sob.
- A robot?

14:00.480 --> 14:01.606
Plankton?

14:05.520 --> 14:06.851
That ain't good.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.443
Initiating lockdown sequence.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.965
Me formuler!

14:20.040 --> 14:22.220
No, no, no! No!

14:22.320 --> 14:23.970
Squidward! Open up!

14:24.120 --> 14:26.930
Victory dance. Boo-ya.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.500
Give me that!

14:28.600 --> 14:31.524
Come on, SpongeBob, join me!

14:31.640 --> 14:35.440
And we'll be rich and powerful,
until I eventually betray you.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.940
- Join me!
- No! Never!

14:39.040 --> 14:41.122
I'm on Team Krabs for life!

14:44.360 --> 14:47.125
Plankton!

14:56.800 --> 14:58.740
What? Where'd it go?

14:58.840 --> 15:01.220
Wait a minute. Molecular deconstruction?

15:01.320 --> 15:04.500
I proved that to be
a scientific impossibility seven times!

15:04.600 --> 15:06.380
Wait a minute.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.086
I think I forgot to empty
Gary's litter box today.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.220
Where's me formuler, Plankton?

15:14.320 --> 15:16.940
I... I don't know! It just disappeared!

15:17.040 --> 15:19.140
Why should I believe you,
you lying liar?

15:19.240 --> 15:20.900
Normally, I'd agree with you, Mr. Krabs,

15:21.000 --> 15:23.580
but this time he's telling the truth.
It just vanished!

15:23.680 --> 15:25.250
It's true!

15:28.800 --> 15:31.500
Mr. Krabs, I'm telling you
he's innocent!

15:31.600 --> 15:33.170
What are you going to do, Krabs?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.580
Pour hot oil on me?

15:34.680 --> 15:36.762
Or put bamboo shoots under my nails?

15:37.040 --> 15:39.691
No. Knock, knock.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.321
Knock-knock jokes?
I can do this all day, Krabs.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.726
Knock, knock.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.008
Oh, boy. Who's there?

15:48.200 --> 15:49.201
Jimmy.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.521
Jimmy who?

15:50.760 --> 15:53.730
Jimmy back my formuler, Plankton!

15:55.040 --> 15:57.771
Well, that's stupid,
but how is it torture?

15:59.040 --> 16:00.860
You'll see.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.203
"Jimmy back my formula"?

16:08.480 --> 16:10.050
I get it!

16:18.600 --> 16:21.490
Make it stop, Krabs! Make it stop!

16:31.560 --> 16:33.927
Mr. Krabs? SpongeBob, zip it!

16:35.800 --> 16:37.900
Thank you, Squidward.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.940
The customers are getting restless!

16:40.040 --> 16:43.408
They're asking for refunds.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.127
Refunds.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.780
Refunds?

16:48.880 --> 16:50.769
Refund! Refund!

16:51.000 --> 16:53.020
Listen up, boy. Get in there

16:53.120 --> 16:55.487
and make me customers
some Krabby Patties!

16:55.720 --> 16:57.688
All right, Plankton...

17:01.920 --> 17:04.002
SpongeBob! What's wrong, boy?

17:07.240 --> 17:09.481
We're out of Krabby Patties?

17:09.680 --> 17:13.780
How can we make more Krabby Patties
without the secret formula?

17:13.880 --> 17:16.260
You've got to have
that formuler memorized by now!

17:16.359 --> 17:17.660
But as you are aware, sir,

17:17.760 --> 17:20.060
the employee handbook clearly states,
and I quote,

17:20.160 --> 17:21.445
"No employee may, in part or in whole,

17:21.560 --> 17:24.371
"commit the Krabby Patty secret formula
to any recorded written or visual form,

17:24.480 --> 17:26.164
"including memories, dreams,
and/or needlepoint."

17:27.079 --> 17:29.740
Curse you, fine print!

17:29.840 --> 17:32.500
Refund! Refund! Refund!

17:32.600 --> 17:34.045
Stop!

17:36.000 --> 17:37.740
I'm not your enemy!

17:37.840 --> 17:39.860
Plankton is your enemy!

17:39.960 --> 17:42.201
So is he an anemone or a plankton?

17:43.480 --> 17:45.801
Well, someone had to do it.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.100
But Mr. Krabs...

17:47.200 --> 17:49.441
He took this from you!

17:49.600 --> 17:52.540
- Krabby Patty...
- I can almost taste it.

17:52.640 --> 17:55.180
Mr. Krabs, Plankton didn't take
the secret formula.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.964
Not now, SpongeBob!

17:57.480 --> 18:00.370
Hey! I ordered a double Krabby Patty!

18:00.600 --> 18:03.570
So join me! Help get the formuler back,

18:03.800 --> 18:07.885
and I'll give each and every one of
you a free Krabby Patty!

18:09.720 --> 18:11.060
No! Wait!

18:11.160 --> 18:13.845
Even better, a slight discount!

18:16.880 --> 18:19.420
To The Chum Bucket!

18:19.520 --> 18:21.010
But he didn't do it.

18:22.160 --> 18:26.290
I had it right in my greedy little mitts,
and then... Poof!

18:26.600 --> 18:29.340
And now it's gone. Gone forever.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.683
I was so close to
gaining the people's respect-slash-fear.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.100
Plankton?

18:34.200 --> 18:38.020
When will my
frustration-slash-humiliation end?

18:38.120 --> 18:40.100
- Plankton?
- Not now, hon!

18:40.200 --> 18:41.884
I'm ranting-slash-raving.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.340
All right, what is it?

18:44.440 --> 18:48.001
Well, I was trying to tell you
there's an angry mob outside.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.681
But now they're inside.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.050
I just work here.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.891
We'd like to have a word with you!

18:59.720 --> 19:01.722
You all look very hungry.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.860
Can I get anybody a Chum Burger?

19:03.960 --> 19:05.564
Enough with the niceties, Plankton!

19:05.880 --> 19:08.724
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.900
Where is me formuler?

19:11.000 --> 19:14.641
I told you, Krabs, I don't have it.

19:14.760 --> 19:16.842
Wrong answer.

19:17.360 --> 19:18.580
Stop!

19:18.680 --> 19:21.047
All right, Mr. Krabs,
let me get in on this.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.843
What's going on around here?

19:26.160 --> 19:28.220
You may want to
step back a little, Mr. Krabs.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.367
This could get messy.

19:29.480 --> 19:30.606
Let's hope so.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.380
So you won't talk, eh, Plankton?

19:33.480 --> 19:35.620
I didn't want to have to do this.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.485
Plankton, here comes the pain.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.843
Soap in the eye, eh? Diabolical!

19:43.400 --> 19:45.607
No! Stop! Don't!

19:46.200 --> 19:48.123
Wait. That didn't look painful.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.642
Mr. Krabs, you may not understand
what I'm about to do today,

19:52.240 --> 19:56.290
but someday we'll look back
and have a good laugh.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.020
Wait a minute.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.963
Hey, they're getting away!

20:00.400 --> 20:01.970
Sorry, Mr. Krabs!

20:02.240 --> 20:06.131
So, you've been running
a long con on me, eh?

20:06.760 --> 20:09.889
All these years you've been
working for Plankton!

20:10.000 --> 20:11.365
They're in cahoots!

20:11.480 --> 20:13.460
Yeah, I guess
that's a short way of saying it.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.289
Stop that bubble!

20:26.320 --> 20:28.721
Please tell me
there's something soft below me.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.481
- Nope.
- Nope.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.648
SpongeBob!

20:34.640 --> 20:37.860
You were like an underpaid son to me.

20:37.960 --> 20:41.089
I would've expected Squidward
to stab me in the back.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.220
What?

20:42.320 --> 20:43.540
But SpongeBob?

20:43.640 --> 20:47.580
Me most trusted employee?
Working with me sworn enemy?

20:47.680 --> 20:50.490
You know what this means, Mr. Squidward.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.900
We get the rest of the day off?

20:52.000 --> 20:52.980
No!

20:53.080 --> 20:56.687
This be but a harbinger
of what I fear lies ahead.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.370
For you. For me.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.170
For all of Bikini Bottom!

21:00.400 --> 21:02.820
The Krabby Patty
is what ties us all together!

21:02.920 --> 21:07.562
Without it, there will be
a complete breakdown of social order.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.320
A war of all against all!

21:10.560 --> 21:13.211
Dark times are ahead.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.325
Dark times indeed!

21:17.720 --> 21:18.881
Seriously?

21:19.760 --> 21:21.888
Aren't you overreacting a bit?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.401
Welcome to the apocalypse,
Mr. Squidward.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.042
I hope you like leather.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.850
I prefer suede.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.962
And so Bikini Bottom became

21:39.280 --> 21:43.046
an apocalyptic cesspool forevermore.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.760
The end.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.244
Wait a minute. That's a terrible ending.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.620
- This is bad. Really bad.
- What? What?

21:52.720 --> 21:54.927
SpongeBob's in trouble
and the story's over?

21:55.080 --> 21:56.889
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.570
Hey, call a therapist!

21:58.920 --> 22:00.331
I have anxiety!

22:02.080 --> 22:05.402
There is no way that
that's the end of this story.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.340
Of course it is. I'll show you.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.521
Just turn around.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.241
All right.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.060
Hey!

22:13.160 --> 22:15.128
I need that to fly, you jerk.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.040
"The

22:19.320 --> 22:20.446
"End"!

22:23.080 --> 22:24.286
That's not the end!

22:24.640 --> 22:25.820
Of course it is!

22:25.920 --> 22:27.940
- Unhand that book!
- You let go of that!

22:28.040 --> 22:29.485
Let go, you numbskull!

22:31.680 --> 22:34.081
You better keep reading, Mr. Pirate,

22:34.760 --> 22:35.921
or else!

22:37.160 --> 22:41.290
I know I shouldn't be littering,
but that ending was rubbish!

22:44.040 --> 22:45.849
Rubbish!

22:55.320 --> 22:57.721
Good morning, Squidward.
I'll have the usual.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.580
With cheese.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.580
We're out of Krabby Patties right now!

23:04.680 --> 23:07.206
No Krabby Patties?

23:07.800 --> 23:10.007
No!

23:11.320 --> 23:14.164
Look what's become of Bikini Bottom.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.841
We've really gotta get
that formula back.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.540
Get the secret formula, you say?

23:20.640 --> 23:23.610
Excuse me, I need a moment.

23:23.800 --> 23:27.407
With that formula,
I could rule the world!

23:31.480 --> 23:33.020
You know I can hear you, right?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.100
Well, what do we do now?

23:35.200 --> 23:38.220
Now we work together.
You know, teamwork.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.540
What's "tee-am work"?

23:40.640 --> 23:42.165
No, Plankton, teamwork.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.620
Tee-am work.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.051
- Teamwork.
- Tie-'em work.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.140
- Teamwork.
- Tie 'em up!

23:46.240 --> 23:48.561
- Say "team," like a sports...
- Team.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.404
- Team. Now say "work."
- Work.

23:50.520 --> 23:51.567
Put them together. What do you got?

23:51.680 --> 23:53.330
Time bomb work.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.527
Getting better!

23:57.480 --> 24:00.563
Now, Bikini Bottom Action News!

24:03.760 --> 24:05.220
Hey, Patrick!

24:05.320 --> 24:08.881
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty,
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty!

24:10.440 --> 24:13.284
Krabby Patty, Krabby Patty, Krabby...

24:13.880 --> 24:15.980
Krabby Patty, Krabby...

24:16.080 --> 24:17.540
Krabby Patty...

24:17.640 --> 24:18.980
Krabby...

24:19.080 --> 24:21.162
Krabby!

24:22.800 --> 24:26.441
Come on, tummy,
it's gonna be a long day.

24:26.760 --> 24:30.540
We interrupt your regular program
for an important news bulletin.

24:30.640 --> 24:34.740
Perch Perkins reporting live
from downtown Bikini Bottom.

24:34.840 --> 24:38.003
Complete chaos here today
as our town attempts to deal with

24:38.120 --> 24:42.380
a sudden and complete shortage
of Krabby Patties.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.500
Events here have
this reporter wondering,

24:44.600 --> 24:48.220
what is the secret ingredient
in Krabby Patties anyway?

24:48.320 --> 24:52.564
It's love!
The secret ingredient is love!

24:54.560 --> 24:55.900
No more Krabby Patties?

24:56.000 --> 24:59.288
If I'd have known that,
I'd have chewed it slower.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.682
What the corndog is that?

25:08.040 --> 25:10.122
Come on, Plankton, it's easy!

25:10.440 --> 25:13.860
It means, I help you, you help me,
and when we accomplish our goal,

25:13.960 --> 25:15.246
then we do hands in the middle.

25:15.360 --> 25:18.364
Hands in the middle?
No, no. Sounds idiotic.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.809
Besides, the two of us
are no match for that cranky mob!

25:25.600 --> 25:29.380
We could probably
use a few more tee-am works.

25:29.480 --> 25:30.860
That's exactly what I was thinking!

25:30.960 --> 25:32.325
Wait, what are you doing?

25:36.000 --> 25:38.970
I need Krabby Patties!

25:40.080 --> 25:41.570
Patrick, what are you doing?

25:41.680 --> 25:42.860
Krabby Patties!

25:42.960 --> 25:44.405
Vandalizing stuff.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.260
Isn't that your house?

25:46.360 --> 25:48.020
Hey, what's with all the questions?

25:48.120 --> 25:49.485
Who are you guys?

25:49.640 --> 25:51.980
It's me, your best friend! SpongeBob?

25:52.080 --> 25:53.206
Yeah?

25:53.320 --> 25:57.564
Well, if you're SpongeBob,
then what's the secret password?

25:58.160 --> 25:59.161
Uh...

25:59.280 --> 26:01.260
Correct! It is you!

26:01.360 --> 26:03.380
SpongeBob!

26:03.480 --> 26:05.260
- SpongeBob.
- Patrick!

26:05.360 --> 26:07.060
SpongeBob!

26:07.160 --> 26:11.220
Why aren't you at The Krusty Krab
making Krabby Patties?

26:11.320 --> 26:13.380
Well, I'd love to,
but the formula's gone.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.540
Yeah, Mr. Krabs says
you and Plankton took it.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.180
No, that's not what happened.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.660
It just disappeared.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.740
We're putting a team together
to find it.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.251
A team?

26:23.120 --> 26:24.724
Pick me! Pick me! Pick me!

26:24.840 --> 26:26.060
Okay, Patrick, you're in.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.650
I don't know, SpongeBob.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.168
What exactly does this clown
bring to the tee-am?

26:31.360 --> 26:33.522
He brings loyalty, Plankton.

26:33.880 --> 26:36.060
Loyalty. Isn't that right, Patrick?

26:36.160 --> 26:37.525
Yeah, yeah, loyalty.

26:38.080 --> 26:40.082
I've got SpongeBob!

26:40.200 --> 26:42.680
He's over here!

26:45.920 --> 26:48.207
Let's go get him!

26:49.400 --> 26:52.020
Come on, SpongeBob,
let's get out of here!

26:52.120 --> 26:53.360
Patrick!

26:54.960 --> 26:56.803
Patrick, why are you doing this?

26:56.960 --> 26:59.167
Because I need

26:59.520 --> 27:01.140
Krabby Patties!

27:01.240 --> 27:03.242
Hurry up! I'm hungry!

27:03.920 --> 27:05.490
Over here!

27:12.160 --> 27:15.209
Guys, am I still on the team?

27:15.680 --> 27:17.603
Hey, what are you looking at?

27:23.480 --> 27:24.720
Sandy!

27:27.720 --> 27:29.085
Sandy!

27:34.720 --> 27:35.926
Sandy?

27:37.040 --> 27:39.008
Sandy, are you home?

27:39.360 --> 27:41.283
Gee, Plankton, I wonder where she is.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.968
What is all this stuff?

27:45.160 --> 27:46.161
Sandy?

27:48.280 --> 27:49.725
Don't touch that!

27:50.240 --> 27:51.924
Incoherent muttering.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.140
Sandy? Are you okay?

27:55.240 --> 27:56.446
Okay?

27:56.880 --> 28:01.380
Have you looked outside?
Does that seem "okay" to you?

28:01.480 --> 28:04.370
I'm trying to figure out
what happened to society.

28:04.760 --> 28:08.048
If we don't fix it soon,
there won't be anything left to fix!

28:08.880 --> 28:10.060
Sandy?

28:10.160 --> 28:12.340
The lack of Krabby Patties
has driven her mad.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.100
And I think I figgered it out.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.281
Look.

28:18.520 --> 28:21.285
When this came down from above,

28:21.880 --> 28:24.929
I knew it could only mean one thing.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.531
And that would be?

28:27.640 --> 28:30.803
It means it's the end!

28:31.000 --> 28:34.641
The sandwich gods are angry with us!

28:34.840 --> 28:36.180
- Sandwich gods?
- Sandwich gods?

28:36.280 --> 28:39.966
I just don't know
how we're going to appease them!

28:47.160 --> 28:50.260
You got any other friends
who aren't dim bulbs or nut jobs?

28:50.360 --> 28:54.285
Well, I have one friend
who's loyal to the very end.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.685
Gary, I'm home.

29:03.640 --> 29:04.766
Gare-bear?

29:06.800 --> 29:07.881
Gary?

29:08.280 --> 29:09.361
Gary?

29:12.200 --> 29:13.220
Revolting!

29:13.320 --> 29:15.180
But it means Gary is close by!

29:15.280 --> 29:17.248
Gary, I'm back!

29:22.800 --> 29:25.900
Hey, Gary, Plankton and I need you
to help us find the Krabby Patty formula

29:26.000 --> 29:27.411
and fix Bikini Bottom.

29:28.360 --> 29:31.091
What do you mean,
you don't have to do as I say anymore?

29:31.880 --> 29:34.121
What do you mean, "King of Snails"?

29:34.320 --> 29:37.529
Gary The Snail, you get down here
right now and join this team!

29:39.160 --> 29:40.844
What do you mean, "Seize them"?

29:45.600 --> 29:46.700
Why are you running?

29:46.800 --> 29:48.882
Because they're right on our tail.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.660
Right, snails.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.660
Well, so much for your tee-am.

29:57.760 --> 30:01.500
Putting together a team is a lot harder
than I thought it would be!

30:01.600 --> 30:02.931
This way!

30:03.040 --> 30:05.805
We better get out of here
until things cool off.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.163
Everything we know and love
has been destroyed.

30:20.600 --> 30:21.940
Yeah, looks like they're gonna have to

30:22.040 --> 30:25.010
change the name of Bikini Bottom
to Dirty Bottom.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.980
Right, SpongeBob?

30:28.080 --> 30:29.980
That's kind of gross, Plankton.

30:30.080 --> 30:32.401
Yeah. Yeah, too soon, huh?

30:33.400 --> 30:36.324
This feels like it really is the end.

30:37.280 --> 30:39.328
Don't worry, SpongeBob,

30:39.480 --> 30:41.100
we'll find the secret formula

30:41.200 --> 30:43.380
and everything will go back
to the way it was,

30:43.480 --> 30:45.721
you know, all happy and junk.

30:47.800 --> 30:51.247
Now let's try and get some sleep.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.560
Yeah, I guess you're right.

31:01.640 --> 31:04.723
Here you are. Feel comfy?

31:04.840 --> 31:06.220
You know, Plankton,

31:06.320 --> 31:11.121
I think you might know a little bit more
about teamwork than you let on.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.810
Good night, SpongeBob.

31:13.440 --> 31:14.965
Good night, Plankton.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.846
"Good night," indeed.

31:21.600 --> 31:24.080
That's right, SpongeBob, sleep.

31:24.280 --> 31:27.329
You're hiding that formula
in there somewhere.

31:31.960 --> 31:34.486
Well, here goes nothing.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.009
What is this place?

31:48.560 --> 31:50.060
Fudge fight!

31:50.160 --> 31:52.481
It's all over me!

31:53.360 --> 31:55.100
It's so sweet in here!

31:55.200 --> 31:57.580
I think my eyeball
is getting a toothache!

31:57.680 --> 31:59.284
Hello, Plankton.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.806
Come and play with us.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.005
Hurry

32:03.120 --> 32:05.361
before we melt.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.300
So much sweetness.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.482
I think I'm going to be sick!

32:42.600 --> 32:43.806
Daddy!

32:48.400 --> 32:50.540
Plankton? Plankton!

32:50.640 --> 32:53.340
I just had the craziest dream!
And you were in it!

32:53.440 --> 32:54.771
I'm sure it was nothing.

32:56.520 --> 32:57.806
Now go back to sleep.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.405
Were you in my brain?

32:59.560 --> 33:02.404
What? No! That's crazy talk!

33:02.680 --> 33:05.900
Then why is there
cotton candy on your antenna?

33:06.000 --> 33:08.765
Because, because...

33:08.880 --> 33:10.848
Okay, fine, I was in your brain.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.020
What were you doing in there?

33:13.120 --> 33:14.780
What do you think I was doing?

33:14.880 --> 33:16.460
Looking for the secret formula.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.608
- What?
- Don't act so innocent.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.250
You knew what I was up to.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.780
That's why you're pretending
not to know the formula.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.140
I'm not pretending!

33:24.240 --> 33:26.020
I can't believe you thought I was lying.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.780
Hey, don't take it personally.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.620
I just assume everyone is lying.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.340
That is a horrible way

33:31.440 --> 33:33.124
- to live your life.
- Whatever.

33:33.240 --> 33:36.050
It is! And if we're going
to be on the same team...

33:36.240 --> 33:40.643
Maybe I don't want to be on the tee-am!
You think of that?

33:40.760 --> 33:43.764
But, Plankton, everything's better
when you're part of a team.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.300
You're not going
to start singing, are you?

33:47.400 --> 33:48.380
Teamwork!

33:48.480 --> 33:49.460
Oh, brother.

33:49.560 --> 33:51.460
We can do anything when we have teamwork

33:51.560 --> 33:53.540
Don't you think so, my friend?

33:53.640 --> 33:55.165
No, tee-am work

33:55.320 --> 33:57.891
Is getting in the way
of my schee-am work

33:58.040 --> 34:00.380
What don't you comprehend?

34:00.480 --> 34:02.482
But working together is the key

34:02.600 --> 34:06.730
Nothing's impossible
when it's you and me

34:06.920 --> 34:08.922
I'm doing just fine on my own

34:09.120 --> 34:10.929
Work is no fun when you do it alone

34:11.040 --> 34:13.380
If I want it done right,
I'll do it by myself

34:13.480 --> 34:15.420
But what if you need
something on a higher shelf?

34:15.520 --> 34:16.580
But I'm the target

34:16.679 --> 34:19.179
Of a very scary,
crazy post-apocalyptic mob!

34:19.280 --> 34:21.100
Well, that's exactly
why you need a partner

34:21.199 --> 34:24.362
Helping you with this important job

34:24.520 --> 34:26.522
I'll be the hammer, you'll be the nail

34:26.639 --> 34:28.483
I'll be the boat and you'll be the sail

34:28.639 --> 34:30.699
I'm the flower, you're the aroma

34:30.800 --> 34:34.900
Right now I wish I was in a coma

34:35.000 --> 34:36.060
Come on.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.139
I'm here for you and you're here for me

34:38.239 --> 34:40.686
It's better when you plus me equals we

34:40.840 --> 34:44.003
Working together in harmony

34:44.159 --> 34:46.367
Side by side, we can reach our dreams

34:46.480 --> 34:48.020
'Cause nothing's impossible

34:48.120 --> 34:50.540
When we're a team!

34:50.639 --> 34:53.100
All right, you can put me down.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.540
Well...

34:54.639 --> 34:56.860
That's one minute of my life
I'll never get back.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.371
Not without a time machine.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.482
Wait a minute. Hold that thought.

35:02.320 --> 35:03.321
Now back up.

35:05.720 --> 35:06.926
Slow down.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.520
Not without a time machine.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.521
Yes!

35:13.680 --> 35:16.684
- SpongeBob, you're a genius!
- I am?

35:16.880 --> 35:18.940
If we build a time machine,

35:19.040 --> 35:21.700
we can go back to before
the formula disappeared.

35:21.800 --> 35:25.441
Before society broke down.
Before we became the hunted!

35:25.560 --> 35:29.690
That sounds great, Plankton,
but how do we build a time machine?

35:30.600 --> 35:32.820
Well, first we'll need
a computer powerful enough

35:32.920 --> 35:35.020
to calculate the intricacies
of time travel.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.043
Where would we get one of those?

35:38.600 --> 35:41.331
There she is. My computer wife.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.562
They've got her tied up
in the back room.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.900
I've never seen
this many people at The Chum Bucket.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.140
I've never seen anyone there.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.460
Now was that really necessary?

35:48.560 --> 35:49.740
Cause the food's really bad.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.420
Come on! Really?

35:51.520 --> 35:53.761
How are we gonna
sneak past those guards?

36:03.800 --> 36:06.451
Well, what do we have here?

36:10.240 --> 36:13.449
We better hurry.
Those guys really hate tires.

36:18.680 --> 36:21.445
We'll never get in. The door's locked.

36:23.440 --> 36:26.011
Wait. The window is open.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.100
Come on, Plankton,

36:27.200 --> 36:29.060
it's time for some teamwork.
Give me a boost.

36:29.160 --> 36:31.128
Okay. Wait a minute, no!

36:33.640 --> 36:35.802
Just a little higher, Plankton.

36:36.440 --> 36:37.601
Plankton?

36:39.120 --> 36:43.091
Why don't you boost me up instead?

36:43.240 --> 36:44.571
Yeah, good thinking.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.887
Come on, SpongeBob, come on!

36:57.720 --> 36:59.051
We're in!

37:01.560 --> 37:03.164
There's a guard over there.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.520
Let's take the key from around his neck.

37:06.640 --> 37:08.740
We're gonna have to be very quiet.

37:08.840 --> 37:11.320
Let's walk on the tips of our toes.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.180
Will you stop playing that tiny piano?

37:25.280 --> 37:26.805
You're gonna get us caught.

37:26.920 --> 37:27.921
Sorry.

37:30.360 --> 37:33.364
Now just reach over and grab it.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.642
Halt! Who goes there?

37:48.920 --> 37:51.685
Stop! Pull it over his head!

37:54.040 --> 37:55.121
Stop, stop, stop!

37:58.480 --> 38:00.403
Let me get up there.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.570
Help me.

38:35.360 --> 38:36.805
What?

38:37.760 --> 38:38.921
No!

38:39.080 --> 38:40.570
Plankton, help!

38:42.640 --> 38:44.563
I'll rock him,
you tell him a bedtime story.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.460
Once upon a time

38:46.560 --> 38:49.882
there was a big fat pink idiot
who went to sleep. The end!

38:50.080 --> 38:52.924
Nice try, but it's
gonna take more than that to...

38:59.080 --> 39:03.244
I told you, I don't have the formula,
you monsters!

39:03.520 --> 39:05.807
- Hey, baby, how are you?
- Plankton!

39:06.000 --> 39:08.260
My hero! You must need something,

39:08.360 --> 39:10.089
otherwise you wouldn't have come back.

39:10.240 --> 39:12.925
Plankton has a plan
to save Bikini Bottom.

39:16.840 --> 39:20.731
It doesn't matter, Plankton.
Krabs knows all your plans.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.844
He's been through my hard drive
looking for the secret formula.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.940
I never had it.
But we're going to get it.

39:27.040 --> 39:28.610
We're gonna go back in time

39:28.720 --> 39:30.961
to steal the formula
before it disappeared.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.201
Time travel!

39:32.320 --> 39:34.580
Where are you gonna find
a computer that can do that?

39:34.680 --> 39:35.920
Wait a minute!

39:40.280 --> 39:41.780
I've never carried a head before.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.291
You'll get used to it.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.050
It's still warm.

39:46.080 --> 39:47.940
So you won't talk, huh?

39:48.040 --> 39:49.804
Let some air out of him.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.687
Is this where
we're gonna build our time machine?

39:56.800 --> 39:59.167
Sure. It's got everything we need.

39:59.320 --> 40:00.321
A photo booth.

40:00.480 --> 40:01.925
A cuckoo clock.

40:03.600 --> 40:04.761
Some day-old chips.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.002
Now all we have to do is build it.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.980
- Oh, no, you don't!
- Hey, my pitch pipe!

40:11.080 --> 40:13.620
I need it. For the time machine.

40:13.720 --> 40:14.960
Okay.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.411
Installed!

40:41.680 --> 40:43.260
I did it!

40:43.360 --> 40:45.460
No, we did it!

40:45.560 --> 40:47.403
Wait. We did do it.

40:47.520 --> 40:48.780
As a tee-am.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.580
- A team.
- Whatever.

40:50.680 --> 40:53.843
Working together in harmony

40:54.000 --> 40:56.241
Side by side, we can reach our dreams

40:56.400 --> 41:00.246
'Cause nothing's impossible
When we're a team

41:00.440 --> 41:02.727
Okay, now for the brains!

41:04.200 --> 41:06.460
Okay, Plankton, this is it.

41:06.560 --> 41:10.201
It's gonna take all my processors
and energy to power this time machine.

41:10.320 --> 41:12.340
So if you have anything
you wanna tell me,

41:12.440 --> 41:13.851
you better tell me now.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.260
Well, Karen...

41:16.360 --> 41:19.762
I know I've taken you for granted
all these years,

41:20.440 --> 41:23.420
and I, I just wanted to say,

41:23.520 --> 41:25.807
I'm glad you're on my tee-am.

41:25.920 --> 41:28.730
Oh, Sheldon, that's the sweetest thing
you've ever...

41:33.560 --> 41:35.460
Plankton, are you crying?

41:35.560 --> 41:37.324
No, no, no!

41:37.560 --> 41:40.700
It's just one of the hazards
of having a giant eyeball.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.740
There's always stuff getting in there.

41:42.840 --> 41:44.569
Anyway, where were we?

41:44.760 --> 41:46.285
Say "cheese."

41:47.760 --> 41:49.125
Cheese!

42:12.520 --> 42:14.682
According to my calculations,

42:14.800 --> 42:17.780
The Krusty Krab should be right here!

42:17.880 --> 42:19.723
What's that over there?

42:21.040 --> 42:23.281
- SpongeBob?
- Patrick?

42:23.440 --> 42:24.805
Is it really you?

42:24.920 --> 42:26.843
- Yes, Patrick, it's...
- Finally!

42:27.080 --> 42:30.846
The Great Krabby Patty Famine is over!

42:31.000 --> 42:34.288
Great Krabby Patty Famine?
What year is this?

42:34.520 --> 42:35.646
It's Thursday.

42:35.840 --> 42:37.860
According to my calculations,

42:37.960 --> 42:40.440
we've only gone
four days into the future.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.170
Where is everybody?

42:42.360 --> 42:46.100
They all gave up on you. But not me!

42:46.200 --> 42:48.362
Cause I'm not very smart.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.928
Where is The Krusty Krab?

42:51.120 --> 42:53.282
Right where it's always been!

43:20.680 --> 43:23.820
I think we may be
lost in time, Plankton.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.207
Maybe we should ask
this guy for directions.

43:27.400 --> 43:30.609
Excuse me, sir?
Can you tell us when we are?

43:31.200 --> 43:36.260
Who dares disturb
The One Who Watches?

43:36.360 --> 43:37.646
The One Who Watches?

43:37.800 --> 43:39.700
Your name is The One Who Watches?

43:39.800 --> 43:43.300
No, my true name is

43:43.400 --> 43:45.084
Bubbles.

43:45.960 --> 43:47.700
Bubbles?

43:47.800 --> 43:50.565
What kind of a name is Bubbles?

43:50.760 --> 43:53.331
It is my ancient dolphin name.

43:53.560 --> 43:56.450
So what's a dolphin doing out here
in the middle of space?

43:56.600 --> 44:00.300
My kind have been
watching and protecting

44:00.400 --> 44:02.687
the galaxy for...

44:04.560 --> 44:06.722
10,000 years!

44:07.560 --> 44:11.020
So you're the one
keeping the meteors from hitting us.

44:11.120 --> 44:12.246
Yes, I am.

44:12.440 --> 44:15.340
And I could really do
with a potty break.

44:15.440 --> 44:18.171
Would you mind keeping an eye on things?

44:18.760 --> 44:22.321
Sure thing.
But what am I keeping my eye on?

44:31.960 --> 44:33.086
What are you doing?

44:33.240 --> 44:34.605
I'm watching.

44:34.800 --> 44:36.245
We don't even know
what we're watching for.

44:36.480 --> 44:38.580
Maybe we should split up the workload.

44:38.680 --> 44:40.340
You watch the one with the big red eye,

44:40.440 --> 44:42.283
I'll watch the one
with the ringy thingies.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.084
Like a team.

44:44.200 --> 44:45.531
Okay, mine's moving.

44:45.760 --> 44:47.125
Mine, too.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.565
No, this doesn't seem right.

44:49.720 --> 44:50.740
Should we call Bubbles?

44:50.840 --> 44:53.446
Let's give him a minute.
He's been holding it for 10,000 years.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.300
I'm pretty sure
that wasn't supposed to happen.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.060
Come on, Plankton,
we got to clean this up

45:02.160 --> 45:04.288
before Bubbles gets back!

45:09.280 --> 45:11.851
Much better. Yes.

45:12.080 --> 45:14.686
You two are free to go.

45:19.040 --> 45:21.771
What happened to Saturn and Jupiter?

45:24.560 --> 45:26.722
You were supposed to...

45:33.480 --> 45:35.620
Keep them from smashing into each other!

45:35.720 --> 45:36.801
Sorry.

45:36.920 --> 45:39.207
Now I am going to lose my job!

45:39.360 --> 45:42.887
And you will lose your lives.

45:50.480 --> 45:51.845
Quarter me!

46:17.200 --> 46:18.440
Plankton?

46:18.960 --> 46:20.200
SpongeBob!

46:22.040 --> 46:23.804
Plankton?

46:23.960 --> 46:25.260
SpongeBob?

46:25.360 --> 46:27.044
Who are you two supposed to be?

46:27.240 --> 46:29.020
I'm you, from the future.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.849
And I'm him from the future.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.500
So you traveled back through time
to help me? Great thinking.

46:34.600 --> 46:35.940
Nope. He's helping me.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.460
But he's the enemy!

46:37.560 --> 46:39.820
Was the enemy. Now we're a team.

46:39.920 --> 46:41.888
What? A tee-am?

46:42.080 --> 46:43.730
A team!

46:43.880 --> 46:46.042
All right, go get the formula.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.125
What have I become?

46:48.280 --> 46:49.566
All right, Plankton.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.780
Do you have
flying boatmobiles in the future?

46:53.880 --> 46:57.340
We only came back
from the day after tomorrow, dimwit.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.010
Are there rocket packs?

47:00.800 --> 47:03.300
- Did they outlaw clothes in the future?
- No!

47:03.400 --> 47:04.460
Then why are you naked?

47:04.560 --> 47:06.927
Because they don't make
clothes in my size.

47:07.040 --> 47:08.087
Hold still, you!

47:09.720 --> 47:13.180
If you're from the future,
what am I gonna say next?

47:13.280 --> 47:15.408
- Something moronic?
- Wow.

47:15.520 --> 47:17.284
Hey, hurry up over there!

47:18.760 --> 47:20.364
That ain't good.

47:20.600 --> 47:22.380
Initiating lockdown sequence.

47:22.480 --> 47:24.847
Come on, SpongeBob,
we gotta get out of here!

47:26.120 --> 47:28.487
- Got it!
- Come on!

47:38.040 --> 47:40.060
That was crazy!

47:40.160 --> 47:42.540
So that's what teamwork is.

47:42.640 --> 47:45.300
All those years I tried
to make you mine,

47:45.400 --> 47:47.260
and I finally did it.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.761
I mean, we did it!

47:49.960 --> 47:52.930
And so it would seem that

47:53.080 --> 47:57.881
our heroes have accomplished
all they had set out to do.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.740
Now that's an ending.

48:00.840 --> 48:02.410
Andy, cue the music.

48:07.200 --> 48:08.531
Oh, no.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.700
That's not the end.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.849
So you mean the ending
might be even happier?

48:16.960 --> 48:18.291
Here we go!

48:19.360 --> 48:22.682
Land ho!

48:25.520 --> 48:27.409
Mom, where's my towel?

48:29.360 --> 48:30.441
What?

48:34.160 --> 48:36.208
- Dude, look at that.
- What?

48:41.000 --> 48:43.526
I'm coming! Come on, you lazy people!

48:43.720 --> 48:46.883
Out of my way! I'm coming!

48:47.600 --> 48:48.806
Out of there!

48:49.880 --> 48:51.006
Sorry!

48:51.160 --> 48:53.242
- Too fast!
- Slow down!

48:53.520 --> 48:55.682
- I'm coming!
- No, no!

49:11.320 --> 49:12.860
Yeah!

49:12.960 --> 49:16.726
All right, you feathered rats,
time to shove off!

49:16.880 --> 49:19.008
What? Why?

49:19.240 --> 49:24.724
Well, I can't have you pooping
all over my restaurant, can I?

49:24.920 --> 49:27.127
Restaurant? I thought
this was a pirate ship.

49:28.040 --> 49:30.100
It is.

49:30.200 --> 49:31.725
But it is also...

49:44.880 --> 49:48.805
My very own food truck!

49:48.920 --> 49:50.001
A what?

49:50.560 --> 49:52.608
You know, a restaurant on wheels.

49:52.840 --> 49:54.763
- Like a garbage truck.
- No!

49:54.920 --> 49:57.082
Are you trying to
scare away my customers?

49:57.280 --> 50:00.124
Well, we're not leaving
till we see how the story ends.

50:00.760 --> 50:02.091
No problem.

50:02.280 --> 50:06.604
You guys like
a little snack while you wait?

50:06.800 --> 50:08.500
- Sure, I'll take a curdled milk.
- How about a fish head?

50:08.600 --> 50:10.045
And a French fry covered in sand.

50:10.280 --> 50:12.660
Who wants some

50:12.760 --> 50:15.001
hot wings?

50:15.240 --> 50:17.083
Wait a minute. Where's Kyle?

50:17.880 --> 50:20.770
Which one of you is next?

50:22.120 --> 50:23.451
He's a madman!

50:23.600 --> 50:24.620
Let's get out of here!

50:24.720 --> 50:26.609
You crazy, man! You crazy!

50:29.920 --> 50:31.140
Bye-bye, Mr. Poop.

50:31.240 --> 50:32.526
Now I can get my gold sticker.

50:34.600 --> 50:36.300
Hey, Mr. Piwate.

50:36.400 --> 50:38.482
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

50:42.120 --> 50:44.805
I can't fly without my feathers.

50:47.160 --> 50:48.660
Where to, Mac?

50:48.760 --> 50:50.330
Just dwive.

50:59.960 --> 51:01.007
Squidward!

51:01.120 --> 51:03.168
Still out of Krabby Patties.

51:05.520 --> 51:08.410
Does anyone have a picture of ketchup?

51:09.240 --> 51:10.685
I done figgered it out!

51:12.760 --> 51:19.484
We have angered the sandwich gods
and only a sacrifice will appease them!

51:19.720 --> 51:21.290
Well, that sounds reasonable.

51:21.480 --> 51:24.882
Soon our post-apoca-whatchamacallit
will be over,

51:25.080 --> 51:28.940
and Krabby Patties
will rain down from above!

51:29.040 --> 51:31.500
Rain down? Well, that's no good.

51:31.600 --> 51:33.364
How will I get me money?

51:33.520 --> 51:36.603
You don't like that idea?
Then we'll sacrifice you!

51:36.840 --> 51:39.525
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

51:45.080 --> 51:47.620
It's not a good idea to have a sacrifice

51:47.720 --> 51:49.740
on an empty stomach.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.922
Who wants a Krabby Patty?

51:54.240 --> 51:56.940
SpongeBob, is that me formuler?

51:57.040 --> 51:58.644
Oh, happy day!

51:59.960 --> 52:01.371
I missed you so much.

52:01.600 --> 52:03.740
Where was it? Where did you find it?

52:03.840 --> 52:05.780
Well, Plankton and I
built a time machine

52:05.880 --> 52:07.740
out of an old photo booth
and then we added...

52:07.840 --> 52:09.285
- Cheese!
- Patrick, wait!

52:10.680 --> 52:12.364
It's okay, everyone.

52:12.520 --> 52:15.285
The post-apocalypse is almost over!

52:18.720 --> 52:20.722
Ain't that right, SpongeBob?

52:21.720 --> 52:23.688
"Eugene, eat my

52:23.880 --> 52:27.566
"subaquatic air bubbles.
Love, Plankton"?

52:29.160 --> 52:30.700
You grabbed the wrong bottle!

52:30.800 --> 52:32.460
I'm sorry, Mr. Krabs!

52:32.560 --> 52:34.420
That's okay, SpongeBob.

52:34.520 --> 52:37.540
We'll just have to sacrifice
the two of you then.

52:37.640 --> 52:40.769
Prepare them for the sacrifice!

52:42.320 --> 52:45.802
I bring a message from the dawn of time!

52:46.000 --> 52:47.001
What is it, Patrick?

52:47.200 --> 52:48.611
Run!

52:51.840 --> 52:54.002
Squidosaurus rex!

53:04.360 --> 53:05.500
Well, Plankton,

53:05.600 --> 53:07.900
I guess we failed
to accomplish our goals.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.500
"We"?

53:09.600 --> 53:13.940
But even failure hurts a little less
when you do it as a team, right?

53:14.040 --> 53:15.610
This is all your fault!

53:17.880 --> 53:19.020
My fault?

53:19.120 --> 53:21.860
You're the one who stole
the wrong secret formula.

53:21.960 --> 53:23.540
I didn't know there were two bottles.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.740
Of course you didn't!

53:25.840 --> 53:28.366
Because you got cotton candy for brains!

53:29.960 --> 53:31.962
No, seriously, he really does.

53:32.120 --> 53:34.220
Well, we wouldn't even be in this mess
in the first place,

53:34.320 --> 53:36.060
if you weren't so selfish and evil.

53:36.160 --> 53:37.940
I was selfish and evil,

53:38.040 --> 53:40.964
until you ruined everything
with your "teamwork"!

53:41.320 --> 53:43.049
You take that back!

53:43.320 --> 53:46.403
You are the worst teammate ever!

53:46.520 --> 53:47.521
No!

53:58.160 --> 54:01.482
Oh, my Neptune, he's mixing
garbage and recycling!

54:12.000 --> 54:13.684
Look at me.

54:14.480 --> 54:16.323
Why, I've become like all of you.

54:17.200 --> 54:18.690
Savage.

54:18.840 --> 54:20.126
Fear-ridden.

54:20.360 --> 54:21.771
Selfish.

54:21.920 --> 54:25.003
An entire town of formerly good citizens

54:25.240 --> 54:27.660
turned into heartless freaks,

54:27.760 --> 54:29.620
bent on their own self-prever...

54:29.720 --> 54:31.260
Self-preter...

54:31.360 --> 54:33.700
- "Preservation?"
- Yes!

54:33.800 --> 54:36.580
We've become alienated from each other.

54:36.680 --> 54:39.020
Each one an island unto himself,

54:39.120 --> 54:41.180
concerned only with ourselves.

54:41.280 --> 54:43.044
And in the name of all fishhood,

54:43.280 --> 54:45.521
I am not about to let that happen!

54:49.960 --> 54:51.100
And so,

54:51.200 --> 54:55.762
if a sacrifice is needed to restore
Bikini Bottom to its former glory...

54:57.760 --> 55:01.242
Then I am willing
to take one for the team!

55:12.320 --> 55:13.401
You heard him!

55:14.880 --> 55:16.245
Sacrifice!

55:16.560 --> 55:19.643
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

55:19.760 --> 55:21.140
Sacrifice!

55:21.240 --> 55:24.244
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

55:28.400 --> 55:32.371
Let the sacrifice begin!

55:32.560 --> 55:34.608
Patties! Patties!

55:35.680 --> 55:38.365
And I thought my friends were primitive.

55:40.080 --> 55:41.660
Don't cry, me boy.

55:41.760 --> 55:44.860
Everything's going to be fine, for us.

55:44.960 --> 55:47.540
I'm not crying, Mr. Krabs.

55:47.640 --> 55:49.085
I smell Krabby Patties!

55:49.280 --> 55:52.540
That's right.
Keep thinking happy thoughts.

55:52.640 --> 55:53.801
Now!

55:53.960 --> 55:55.689
Sacrifice! Sacrifice!

56:07.840 --> 56:09.330
The boy's right.

56:09.960 --> 56:11.020
My leg!

56:11.120 --> 56:12.420
I smell 'em, too!

56:12.520 --> 56:14.807
Okay, SpongeBob, go get it!

56:14.920 --> 56:18.527
Wait. You mean we can
just take this stuff off?

56:18.640 --> 56:20.290
Go find that Krabby Patty!

56:24.000 --> 56:25.240
Come on, everybody!

56:25.360 --> 56:28.489
I've got some Krabby Patty
orders to fill!

56:36.320 --> 56:38.482
It's coming from over there!

57:00.520 --> 57:03.842
Come on, guys,
I think it's just over this hill.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.980
How do you expect us
to go up to the surface?

57:10.080 --> 57:11.300
We won't be able to breathe!

57:11.400 --> 57:14.290
All right, all secondary characters
come with me.

57:14.680 --> 57:17.740
- Yeah, I'm with you guys.
- No way, Squidward.

57:17.840 --> 57:20.060
You're going up there with us.

57:20.160 --> 57:21.580
My feet hurt.

57:21.680 --> 57:23.250
Patrick, you don't have feet.

57:24.440 --> 57:26.980
It's not fair! You have feet.

57:27.080 --> 57:30.880
Sandy has feet. Squidward has feet.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.644
Actually, I have four feet.

57:36.880 --> 57:38.100
It's not about feet.

57:38.200 --> 57:39.620
What is it about, then?

57:39.720 --> 57:43.566
It's about being a team
and sticking together, no matter what!

57:43.720 --> 57:45.980
The only way
we're going up there is if some

57:46.080 --> 57:49.482
fairy godmother shows up
and helps us breathe air.

57:54.760 --> 57:57.580
- Bubbles!
- SpongeBob, you know this guy?

57:57.680 --> 57:59.780
Don't hurt us!
We're sorry we got you fired.

57:59.880 --> 58:02.100
Hurt you?

58:02.200 --> 58:05.170
Why, I traveled back
through time to thank you.

58:05.400 --> 58:08.210
I've been stuck in that job for eons.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.620
I needed a change,

58:10.720 --> 58:13.610
but I was too afraid to go for it.

58:13.880 --> 58:16.660
Well, Bubbles, I'm glad we could help.

58:16.760 --> 58:19.380
Now it is my turn to help.

58:19.480 --> 58:22.245
I can get you safely to the surface.

58:22.440 --> 58:23.980
Now!

58:24.080 --> 58:27.460
Quick, all of you, get in my mouth.

58:27.560 --> 58:28.940
Come on, guys, let's go!

58:29.040 --> 58:32.249
There's no way I'm climbing
into some dolphin's mouth.

58:32.360 --> 58:34.840
Yeah. This guy just wants a free lunch.

58:35.040 --> 58:39.140
Guys, if Bubbles has the courage
to quit his dead-end, nowhere job

58:39.240 --> 58:41.180
and travel back through time to help us,

58:41.280 --> 58:43.248
then we need to have the courage to...

58:47.960 --> 58:50.122
Well, I never thought
I'd be eaten by a dolphin.

58:50.240 --> 58:51.340
No, if he was eating us,

58:51.440 --> 58:53.727
he'd be chewing us up
and we'd be going down there.

58:53.840 --> 58:56.180
This is what you call riding in style.

58:56.280 --> 58:58.601
Not a lot of legroom in here.

58:58.720 --> 59:01.485
Well, maybe if you didn't
have four feet!

59:02.800 --> 59:06.168
Note to self:
Never stow away in a gym sock.

59:17.480 --> 59:20.165
What's happening? I feel tingly!

59:28.880 --> 59:29.961
My neck!

59:32.160 --> 59:34.180
I've done all I can.

59:34.280 --> 59:36.420
The rest is up to you.

59:36.520 --> 59:38.045
Thank you, Bubbles!

59:38.240 --> 59:40.208
Farewell, SpongeBob.

59:40.320 --> 59:41.820
Farewell, Bubbles.

59:41.920 --> 59:44.082
Now to update my...

59:46.280 --> 59:47.520
Resume!

59:52.880 --> 59:55.724
Fresh air! How I've missed you.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.444
This place smells awful!

59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.091
Come on, guys.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.931
Let's get the Krabby Patty formula
and save Bikini Bottom.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.180
What is this place?

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.284
I have a bad feeling about this.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.768
Maybe this guy knows where we are.
He looks smart.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.780
He's got five heads.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.860
Sir? Could you tell us
where to find a Krabby Patty?

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:22.611
Hey, my friend's talking to you!

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.447
What?

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:28.928
A giant, hairy porpoise!

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.931
It's beached!

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.329
It's suffering. Poor thing.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.620
Y'all, those aren't porpoises.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.722
- All hands on deck!
- Oh, brother.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.608
We need to get these guys
back in the water.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.131
Come on! Push!

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.368
- Heave!
- Ho!

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:50.844
- Heave!
- Ho!

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.460
Put your back into it!

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:54.164
Come on, push!

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.246
Well, I guess this is where that
horrible smell was coming from.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.970
Excuse me, do you know where we can get
a Krabby Patty around here?

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.690
Invaders!

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.660
You get out of my sister's sand castle!

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.841
Mom!

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:41.651
Where have you been all my life?

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.820
Oh, Frank.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.763
That feels so good.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:57.121
Gross!

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.370
Oh, hey, Squidward.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.860
Sandy!

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.371
The Krabby Patty!

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:06.845
I think I see where it's coming from!

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.740
SpongeBob, you will not believe the size
of the ice creams here.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.060
I wonder what
other giant snacks they have.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.208
Cotton candy?

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.900
If you ate all that,
you'd have enough energy

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.684
to run around the whole world!

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.771
When is the sugar gonna wear off?

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.766
Hey, guys, I smell Krabby Patties!

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.803
I think it's this way!

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.805
Don't leave me, Squidward!

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.210
- Now what?
- We're never going to make it!

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:37.207
- Heave!
- Ho!

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.926
We're doing it, guys!

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.566
Dude, watch out!

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.925
Hold on!

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.967
SpongeBob!

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.445
- Lean!
- Starboard!

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.447
- What the...
- What?

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.450
"Home of the Krabby Patty"?

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.980
But The Krusty Krab
is the home of the Krabby Patty!

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.780
Mr. Krabs, what are we gonna do?

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.060
$8.99 for a Krabby Patty?

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.209
Why didn't I think of that?

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.406
You!

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:37.285
Cease and desist
that unauthorized patty flipping!

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.020
Yeah, that's my job!

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.326
How did you get here?

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.770
You cannot breathe air.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.660
Well, there was this magical dolphin

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.700
from the future who shot us
out of his blowhole, and...

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.928
Wait! Wait.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.490
That's not in the book.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.641
Book?

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.161
There is no magical dolphin
in this story.

01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.810
What story?

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:06.020
The story of how Bikini Bottom
was brought to its knees

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.780
when its beloved Krabby Patty formula

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.340
was stolen by me,

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.010
Burger Beard.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.964
How does it end?

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.340
Well, let me see.

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.761
It looks like

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:24.700
Burger Beard becomes the richest

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.441
food truck proprietor in all the land.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.900
But how did you steal the formula?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.047
That was easy.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:36.049
I simply rewrote the story, and...

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.207
Poof!

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:39.060
Me formuler!

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.242
What do you mean, rewrote the story?

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.566
Watch this.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.371
"The brave

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.220
"and handsome

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.220
"Burger Beard

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.460
"banished our poor heroes

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.608
"to be stranded on

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:57.002
"Pelican Island!"

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.328
"The End"!

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.940
This looks bad.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.849
And these guys look hungry!

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.166
Look out!

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.300
Nice. So this is what teamwork gets you.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.165
Here! Take Squidward, you vile beasts!

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.460
I want to be on a new team.
This one's broken.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.483
Sandy, you're smart. You have any ideas?

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.768
I ain't been too smart
since I found this old piece of paper!

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.083
- What?
- Incoming!

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.250
Wait a minute!

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.404
Now all we need is some ink!

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.326
Which Squidward has helpfully provided.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.763
It happens when I'm nervous.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.002
Whatever you're going to do,
make it quick!

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.660
They're closing in on us!

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.250
I'm gonna write us an ending.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.020
Will it be a happy ending?

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.600
It's going to be superpowered!

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.644
I'll show you a happy ending.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.891
Patrick!

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.085
Hey, I got feet!

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.970
What is in these things?

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.881
We'll take one secret formula to go!

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.340
Clear the area, citizens.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.330
There's going to be
some serious aft-kicking here.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.529
But I banished you.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:11.085
Sour Note?

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:21.323
My tiny little eardrums!

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.090
Hey, hey, wait! Hold on! Hold on!

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:28.930
Wait! Wait! Customers!

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.202
Wait, please!

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:33.444
Mr. Superawesomeness,

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.404
take him down.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.042
Maybe we should have picked
a better superpower for you, Patrick.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:00.880
Let's see you get out of this one!

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.890
Get ready for the Invinci-Bubble!

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.371
No!

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.970
My book!

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.020
All right, team,
time for hands in the middle!

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.460
Yes!

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.210
Oh, yeah.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.002
Great job, guys. We did it!

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:38.540
What?

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.926
Sandy? Is that you?

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.004
You can call me The Rodent!

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.926
Hey, where'd the pirate go?

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.610
It looks like Burger Beard

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:03.121
forgot the first rule
of mobile fry cooking.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.280
Always batten down your grease traps.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.761
Follow that grease, team!

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.685
There she blows.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.764
Oh, no, you don't.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.611
He's after the book!

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.740
Sandy, use your squirrel powers!

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.921
Roger that!

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.405
She's never gonna make it!

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.820
Everyone...

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.604
Lean!

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.011
That's what you get.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:34.404
Come here.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:36.220
The book!

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.890
Sour Note!

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.611
All right, Burger Beard,
prepare to be teamworked!

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:00.282
I'm going to scrub my armpits with you.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.420
I don't get it.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.931
Because you're a sponge.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.121
Duh.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.210
Get him, The Rodent!

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.970
Consider him roasted!

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.727
Aw, nuts! I'm all out of nuts!

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.846
Justice is best soft served.

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:50.963
Patrick, I should have
never doubted your powers!

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.565
I can't think of a sweeter way to go.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.408
It's all mine!

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.570
Not so fast, Booger Beard!

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.324
Me formuler.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.927
This will make you feel a little butter.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.051
Not melted butter!

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:44.525
Mr. Krabs!

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.608
Oh, yeah!

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.125
They're beautiful!

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.087
Patrick!

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.885
I gotcha!

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.161
SpongeBob!

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.966
- Patrick?
- Talk to me, buddy.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.771
I'm... I'm seeing a bright light.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.644
Is this better?

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.460
Much. Thank you.

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.580
But the discomfort I feel
in my eyes is nothing

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:09.420
compared to the shame I feel
for letting down the Patty.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.568
For letting down Bikini Bottom.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.291
Yeah, SpongeBob, you really blew it.

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:17.649
No, Patrick, we blew it, as a team.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:20.161
Nope. This one's on you.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.851
Where do you think you're going?

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:34.245
Why don't you get going, little fella,
before you hurt yourself?

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.406
Plankton?

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.042
It's Plank-Ton!

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.731
Come on down from there, little fella.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.847
You wouldn't want to get hurt.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.689
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.251
My eye!

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:41.651
He's getting away!

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:47.445
Ready for a Plank-Ton of bubbles?

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.603
The formula, please.

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:15.845
Come on. Team up with me.
We'll be rich and powerful!

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.121
No, thanks.

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:19.288
I'm already part of a teamwork.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.220
Can we do hands in the middle again?

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.540
Yes, we can, Patrick.

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.610
But this time, there's one more
hand to go in the middle.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.761
Plankton?

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.765
Oh, no.

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.325
Here you go, Krabs.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.020
She's all yours.

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.442
This doesn't have
another insulting note in it, does it?

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:12.900
No, that's the old me.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.401
The one who turned his back
on everything important

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.180
just to have that formula
all to himself.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:22.365
But I realize now that keeping
something to myself is...

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.260
Selfish.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:27.523
Especially when that something
is the Krabby Patty.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.140
Okay, everybody, let's get back
to Bikini Bottom and...

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:33.766
Oh, no! I don't have the page!

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.927
Oh, no!

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.530
It must be back on Pelican Island!

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:40.042
Don't worry. I thought of everything.

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:42.891
All right, SpongeBob, take us home.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.087
Thanks.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.500
- Squidward!
- Oh, yeah.

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:50.207
Come on, it's time to go back
and open up The Krusty Krab!

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.780
Are you out of your patty-flipping mind?

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.060
I'll never leave this place!

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:57.460
I mean, look at me. I'm a god!

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:00.086
No, Squidward, you're a cashier.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:04.763
Wait a minute! What? No!

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.970
Well, it was fun while it lasted.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.491
Don't be sad, Squidward.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:16.291
I left you a little surprise
under your shirt!

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.248
Rock-hard abs!

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.260
Aw, SpongeBob, you're okay in my book.

01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:25.300
Aw, shucks.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:29.325
Excuse us! We'd like
3,000 Krabby Patties, please!

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.963
That sound must mean
things are back to normal.

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.651
Who wants 3,000 Krabby Patties?

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.580
First one's for you, Gary.

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.648
Extra mayo, just the way you like it.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.564
Caught you red-handed!

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.420
Gary hates mayo.

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:57.220
Plankton!
Up to your old tricks again already, eh?

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:59.820
Hey, I'm just putting things
back the way they were.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.729
What do you have
to say about this, Gary?

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:03.761
Oh, shrimp.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.571
See you later, tee-am-mate!

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.807
- Now can we sing it?
- Yeah!

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.007
Pwease, Mr. Piwate?

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:27.288
Oh, Kyle...

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:31.484
How can I say no to you?

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.220
Are you ready, kids?

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:36.900
- Aye-aye, Captain!
- Aye-aye, Captain!

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.180
What did you say?

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:42.580
There's sand in my ears
and I can't hear you!

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.047
- Aye-aye, Captain!
- Aye-aye, Captain!

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.540
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.404
SpongeBob SquarePants!

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.688
Absorbent and yellow and porous is he!

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.529
SpongeBob SquarePants!

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.603
If nautical nonsense
be something you wish

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:00.484
SpongeBob SquarePants!

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:02.700
Then drop on the deck
and flop like a fish!

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.689
- SpongeBob SquarePants!
- Ready?

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:08.521
SpongeBob SquarePants!

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.140
SpongeBob SquarePants!

01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.730
Silence!

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.740
Oh, man. I like that song.
What happened?

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:18.100
I don't like that song
and I put an end to it.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.540
Well, this music is terrible.

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.971
I suppose you're entitled to your...

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.366
Wait. Why am I talking to you?

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:23.846
You're an inferior species

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.460
What could you know about taste?

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:28.340
You get excited by
a pile of trash on a plate

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.683
While I'm a spacetime traveler
Fabric unraveler

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.740
Saving the Patty's in the past
But now I'm rapping ya

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.460
That song's so bad
That I can't even stand it

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:39.180
Dispense with this nonsense at once

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.486
I demand it!

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.100
You all stand no chance

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.620
Against my power
Don't try it

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.140
Just sit there
with your flappy beak shut

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.220
And be quiet!

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.481
Hold up, fish guts

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:49.540
- You can't insult us
- The Seagull crew

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.820
We're in no mood to hear... from you!

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:54.844
We're floating on the breeze
Party in seven seas

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.380
You got your nose on your head

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.244
You blow up when you sneeze

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.460
Why's this guy so mean?

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.210
'Cause he's older than a fossil

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.500
All alone up in space

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.090
Yeah, that must be awful

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.771
Here, knock it off!
Yer making the movie too long!

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.100
Why don't you take us back in time

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:10.089
So we can finish our song?

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.525
Fine.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:22.482
SpongeBob SquarePants!

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.606
That was pretty good, actually.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.290
Yeah, sorry!

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.768
This dance is so last year.

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.084
You know what this needs?

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:38.243
A little interpretive dance!
