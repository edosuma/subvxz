00:02.540 --> 00:04.230
<i>Previously, on
"Tyrant"</i>

00:04.270 --> 00:05.220
<i>You raped me,</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:07.590
<i>and then you killed my father
for defending my honor</i>

00:07.620 --> 00:09.520
and I'll never say a word
of any of it

00:09.560 --> 00:11.220
or speak against the family
because of this.

00:11.260 --> 00:13.860
My baby is your heir
after Ahmed.

00:13.890 --> 00:15.330
That's the deal,
isn't it?

00:15.360 --> 00:18.200
I am appointing you Minister
of Energy Development.

00:18.230 --> 00:19.970
I don't know anything
about the oil business.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.430
You will learn.

00:21.470 --> 00:23.200
Uh, Sammy,
this is James Timmons.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.540
He's an attorney.

00:24.570 --> 00:25.840
He's helping me
with Dad's estate.

00:25.840 --> 00:27.370
Well, the terms
of the trust specify

00:27.370 --> 00:28.740
that the money passes

00:28.770 --> 00:30.010
along the male line.

00:30.040 --> 00:32.580
Samuel has inherited
$100 million.

00:32.610 --> 00:34.800
You didn't tell
us your name.

00:34.840 --> 00:35.880
Khalil.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.050
What if the government
find out

00:37.080 --> 00:38.350
that we are harboring
a fugitive?

00:38.380 --> 00:39.780
They won't,
because no one

00:39.820 --> 00:41.850
in this room
will say anything.

00:41.890 --> 00:43.050
Ahmos is my husband.

00:43.090 --> 00:44.520
This is our son,
Ghani.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.890
I'm his second wife.

00:45.890 --> 00:47.660

<i>Al Fayeed is denying it,
of course,</i>

00:52.600 --> 00:54.060
blaming Ihab Rashid,

00:54.100 --> 00:56.230
but everyone knows the truth.

00:56.270 --> 00:58.100
- Jamal Al Fayeed did this.
- Because of Ihab.

00:58.140 --> 01:00.940
Because we were foolish
enough to support you.

01:00.970 --> 01:03.730
It's over, so pack
your things and leave.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.600

How long will you stay
with us?

01:49.850 --> 01:51.820
I'm not sure.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.390
You like living here?

01:57.990 --> 01:59.190
Yeah, I do.

01:59.230 --> 02:02.200
So maybe you should stay.

02:04.330 --> 02:05.600
[Daliyah] Ghani?

02:07.670 --> 02:09.970
I've been waiting for you
in the dairy shed.

02:10.009 --> 02:11.910
You were supposed
to help me make yogurt.

02:11.940 --> 02:14.710
I'm helping Khalil.

02:14.740 --> 02:16.740
<i>Ghani, please.</i>

02:19.710 --> 02:21.580
Ghani, please.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.430
I've been looking
forward to it.

02:24.950 --> 02:26.190
Go on.

02:40.450 --> 02:43.370
He has been distancing himself
lately from his mother,

02:43.400 --> 02:45.270
I think because
she's leaving.

02:47.470 --> 02:48.740
Daliyah's leaving?

02:48.780 --> 02:50.040
For Germany.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.040
She's been accepted
at a program

02:52.080 --> 02:55.450
to bring solar power
to our village.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.480
We have too much sunshine
and not enough electricity.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.400
Khalil, sit with me.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.400
[animals making noise in background]

03:05.560 --> 03:07.560
[Khalis sighs deeply]

03:07.560 --> 03:09.660
Khalil...

03:10.900 --> 03:12.700
The people coming
for Daliyah,

03:12.730 --> 03:14.270
they are from
the government.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.800
You should keep your head down
until they leave.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.400
[door closes]

03:28.100 --> 03:30.100
[envelope rustling]

03:30.100 --> 03:31.850
[Taj] I'm sorry.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.280
It's... It's stale.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.290
Amazing how quickly

03:35.320 --> 03:37.620
we've learned
to live like rats. [sighs]

03:40.150 --> 03:43.160
It's, uh...
It's not for long.

03:47.030 --> 03:48.630
Listen, uh...

03:48.670 --> 03:52.370
I need you to go
to the leather shop

03:52.400 --> 03:54.370
on El-Shaikh Zayed.

03:54.410 --> 03:58.640
I want you to ask for
Salim Tawfeek.

03:58.680 --> 04:01.080
And give him this.

04:03.870 --> 04:05.220
And say what?

04:05.250 --> 04:06.450
"Here is a photo
of the most wanted man

04:06.480 --> 04:07.550
in the whole of Abuddin"?

04:07.550 --> 04:08.920
Salim is a forger

04:08.950 --> 04:10.420
I've been talking to.

04:10.460 --> 04:13.560
You give this to him,

04:13.590 --> 04:17.290
and you wait for him to
finish with my documents.

04:17.290 --> 04:18.630
[coughs]

04:18.630 --> 04:20.459
When you have... [clears throat]

04:20.500 --> 04:22.470
...my visa and my
passport in your hand,

04:22.500 --> 04:24.130
you come straight
back here.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.770
You don't stop.
You don't talk to anyone.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.970
Do you know what to do?

04:28.010 --> 04:29.770
Easy.

04:29.810 --> 04:31.940
Good.
[envelope rustles, thuds]

05:10.810 --> 05:13.080
I'm so sorry
about your mother.

05:13.120 --> 05:16.280
She was a
wonderful woman.

05:18.330 --> 05:21.560
Dr. El-Hashem
gave her the best care.

05:21.590 --> 05:23.120
You were talking to
her doctor?

05:23.160 --> 05:26.360
Of course.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.330
I tried to make it
back in time,

05:28.360 --> 05:29.800
but I was a day
too late.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.800
You were a wonderful son.

05:32.830 --> 05:34.470
You were the best son.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.400
She was so proud of you.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.180
Before you leave again...

05:43.210 --> 05:45.980
and I've given this
a great deal of thought...

05:46.010 --> 05:49.180
I want you
to meet your father.

05:52.390 --> 05:55.290
I've been lucky
to have you in my life.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.360
But I've been fine
without him.

05:57.390 --> 05:59.330
And he's been fine
without me.

05:59.330 --> 06:02.080
Only because
he didn't know you existed.

06:03.100 --> 06:06.000
It's time for him
to learn he has

06:06.030 --> 06:08.440
another son.

06:09.170 --> 06:10.570
<i>[doctor] See that?</i>

06:10.570 --> 06:12.670
That's the baby's spine.
[heart beating sound]

06:12.710 --> 06:14.470
Those are the ribs,
[heart beating sound]

06:14.510 --> 06:16.310
those tiny little things there.

06:16.340 --> 06:20.010
And that's the
baby's hand.

06:20.050 --> 06:21.590
Is that the heart?

06:23.320 --> 06:24.650
Normal rhythm.

06:24.680 --> 06:25.920
Fetal heart rate:

06:25.950 --> 06:28.250
158 beats per minute.

06:28.290 --> 06:30.360
Can you tell us
the child's sex?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.070
If it's all right
with the parents.

06:33.130 --> 06:35.260
Of course it's all right
with the parents.

06:37.260 --> 06:39.630
[inhales and exhales deeply]

06:39.630 --> 06:42.170
It's a boy.

06:42.170 --> 06:44.170
[laughing] We're gonna have
a son.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.770
A son.

06:46.770 --> 06:50.080
[door opens]
[hinges squeak]

06:50.080 --> 06:51.680
Oh. Mother.

06:51.710 --> 06:55.210
What a surprise.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.350
I'm sure you understand.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.720
It's... It's going
to take me

07:00.750 --> 07:02.620
some...
some time.

07:02.660 --> 07:07.830
So you came to forgive me
or to berate me?

07:09.270 --> 07:11.130
This morning,
I went to see

07:11.160 --> 07:13.830
the son of a friend.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.870
He won the
Sword of Honor

07:18.900 --> 07:20.240
when he graduated
from Sandhurst

07:20.270 --> 07:21.710
and now he's
a commander,

07:21.740 --> 07:24.040
on the United Nations
Peacekeeping Force.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.880
Mm.

07:26.910 --> 07:30.650
He sounds like
a remarkable young man.

07:32.780 --> 07:35.950
I was at his
mother's funeral.

07:35.990 --> 07:37.870
Okay.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.820
I'm very sorry.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.730
What?

07:44.760 --> 07:47.500
She was Safaa Said.

07:49.170 --> 07:51.770
Safaa...

07:51.770 --> 07:55.970
she died?

07:56.010 --> 07:58.610
Uh...

07:58.640 --> 07:59.840
You were

07:59.880 --> 08:02.040
at her funeral?

08:02.080 --> 08:03.750
I've kept in touch
with her

08:03.780 --> 08:05.880
for the last 25 years.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.880
While forbidding me
from seeing her?

08:08.920 --> 08:10.600
That was your father.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.600
[leafs thud]

08:16.660 --> 08:20.000
I did it to take care of her
and her child.

08:20.030 --> 08:23.500
Doesn't he have a father
to look after him?

08:23.530 --> 08:26.270
His father never knew
he existed.

08:29.210 --> 08:31.510
He walked away
before the boy was born.

08:31.540 --> 08:34.240
Not because
he wanted to...

08:34.280 --> 08:36.950
No, no,
no, no. [nervous laugh]

08:36.950 --> 08:38.549
You are lying.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.419
He is lying,
someone is lying here...

08:40.450 --> 08:42.419
He's your son.

08:48.260 --> 08:50.830
If I had known
she was pregnant...

08:50.860 --> 08:52.290
Nothing would
have changed.

08:52.330 --> 08:54.730
Your father wouldn't have
allowed it.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.570
A poor girl from Ma'an.
A Rashid cousin.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.340
It would have been
my choice.

09:02.370 --> 09:04.140
I'm sorry.

09:05.780 --> 09:09.240
I did the only thing
that was in my power to do.

09:09.280 --> 09:11.150
I took care of him for you.

09:13.180 --> 09:15.820
Why now?

09:15.850 --> 09:20.390
Why are you turning my life
upside down?

09:20.420 --> 09:23.320
Because your father
is dead.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.260
Because your brother
is dead.

09:25.290 --> 09:30.140
Because our lives have
suddenly become so very tenuous.

09:32.630 --> 09:35.400
It's time
you met him, Jamal.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.870
And he met you.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.840
Just go away.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.560
- Jamal...
- Go away.

09:48.360 --> 09:51.360
[footsteps departing]

09:55.300 --> 09:57.120
Oh, it's... [sighs]

09:57.160 --> 09:59.460
it's useless.

09:59.490 --> 10:01.030
I can't sleep.

10:01.530 --> 10:03.530
[shivering]

10:03.530 --> 10:05.530
[exhales deeply]

10:05.530 --> 10:07.930
All those faces,
staring at me...

10:11.670 --> 10:13.210
I just can't stop thinking

10:13.240 --> 10:15.710
- that we're abandoning them.
- We fought

10:15.740 --> 10:17.210
as hard as we could.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.210
There is nothing left
for us to do.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.380
Except run away.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.050
[pounding at door]

10:24.050 --> 10:25.980
Ihab, it's Taj.
Open up.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.290
[envelope rustling]

10:30.290 --> 10:32.290
[dog barks in distance]

10:32.960 --> 10:35.090
Where are
the documents?

10:35.130 --> 10:36.690
- Where are the documents?
- What's wrong?

10:36.730 --> 10:39.100
They threatened
to kill my family.

10:39.130 --> 10:41.700
No! No!
Samira! [screams]

10:41.730 --> 10:42.930
- No!
- Samira!

10:42.930 --> 10:44.670
[Samira screms]

10:44.670 --> 10:47.070
- I'm sorry.
- No!

known it was you.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.150
You know him?

12:41.190 --> 12:42.890
Ihab and I are old friends

12:42.920 --> 12:44.890
from our university days
in Cairo.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.760
Friends?

12:46.790 --> 12:48.160
No.

12:48.190 --> 12:50.230
I think of you as my friend.

12:50.260 --> 12:52.530
Of course,
we've taken different paths.

12:52.560 --> 12:55.000
I have all this, and you've

12:55.030 --> 12:56.560
lost everything.

[indistinct conversation in background]

12:58.240 --> 12:59.440

you some food.

13:02.070 --> 13:03.340
This way.

Please.

13:05.990 --> 13:08.580
It's... It's okay,
it's okay.

13:08.580 --> 13:12.580
[chirping continues]

13:15.550 --> 13:18.360
Sorry for the
rough treatment.

13:18.390 --> 13:20.020
I wasn't sure
you'd accept

13:20.020 --> 13:21.860
a more formal
invitation.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.630
[sighs and breaths]

13:23.630 --> 13:25.160
What do you want?

13:25.200 --> 13:27.260
I want to help you
liberate Abuddin

13:27.300 --> 13:29.700
from the apostate
Al Fayeeds.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.000
Finish the job
your father started

13:32.040 --> 13:33.540
30 years ago.

13:33.570 --> 13:35.870
- I'm done fighting.
- Done?

13:35.910 --> 13:39.110
No.

13:39.140 --> 13:41.280
From where I'm standing,

13:41.310 --> 13:43.680
you haven't even begun.

13:45.820 --> 13:48.220
Ahmed, the Chinese
 ambassador mentioned

13:48.250 --> 13:50.220
they are waiting
for you to sign off

13:50.250 --> 13:51.890
on their proposal.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.660
I'm still working through it.

13:53.690 --> 13:56.460
They sent it to you
last week.

13:56.490 --> 13:58.590
It's nearly 300 pages.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.600
Then wake up earlier

14:01.630 --> 14:03.810
and go to bed later.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.870
[sighs]
[folder thuds]

14:06.870 --> 14:10.570
If you want,
I can go over it with you.

14:10.610 --> 14:12.470
No.

14:12.510 --> 14:13.940
I'll take care of it.

14:15.950 --> 14:17.610
Good.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.830
I also wanted to
give you something.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.790
Oh.

14:28.820 --> 14:31.960
Yes, your mother
told me.

14:31.990 --> 14:34.230
It's wonderful news.

14:34.260 --> 14:35.900
It's a boy.

14:35.930 --> 14:39.100
I never knew I'd be so happy
to have a son.

14:45.470 --> 14:47.140
Congratulations.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.140
[footsteps departing]

14:55.180 --> 14:57.150
[door opens]
[hinges squeak]

14:57.150 --> 14:59.150
[door closes]

15:03.850 --> 15:05.850
[blows out air]

15:08.850 --> 15:10.850
[clears throat]

15:10.850 --> 15:12.850
[clicking phone keypad]

15:12.850 --> 15:14.850
[line ringing]

15:16.710 --> 15:17.650
<i>[Amira] Hello.</i>

15:17.690 --> 15:18.940
Mother.

15:18.970 --> 15:21.040
I...

15:21.080 --> 15:24.140
I want to see him.

15:24.180 --> 15:26.110
Will you bring him to me?

15:26.110 --> 15:28.110
[door bell rings]

15:29.080 --> 15:30.320
Hey.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.390
Did I mess up the date?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.010
I thought we were having
dinner tomorrow night.

15:33.010 --> 15:34.720
We are.
Can I come in?

15:34.760 --> 15:36.560
Yeah, of course.
Sorry.

15:36.590 --> 15:38.890
We just had dinner,
but I can reheat

15:38.930 --> 15:40.270
something up for you
if you're hungry.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.100
Oh, no,
thank you, I ate.

15:43.600 --> 15:46.250
- Hey!
- Good evening.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.840
So, what's going on?

15:47.870 --> 15:49.770
Did you find
my Lady Al Fayeed trust?

15:49.800 --> 15:51.900
- I'm still working on that.
- Excuse her, she's still mad

15:51.940 --> 15:55.270
that I'm getting that
$100 million for having

15:55.310 --> 15:57.580
- a Y chromosome. Sorry. [laughs]
- [Molly chuckles]

15:57.610 --> 15:59.510
So, uh, there's
been a development

15:59.550 --> 16:02.990
in Sammy's case, and we
need to discuss next steps.

16:03.020 --> 16:04.000
Next steps?

16:04.030 --> 16:06.050
Uh, I'm not sure yet
who initiated this,

16:06.090 --> 16:08.470
but the legal team
representing the Al Fayeed trust

16:08.500 --> 16:09.990
is contesting the will.

16:10.020 --> 16:11.790
Uh, what does
 that mean?

16:11.820 --> 16:14.530
Well, the issue lies in the
question of whether the money

16:14.560 --> 16:15.990
ever passed to your father

16:16.030 --> 16:19.130
after the death
of Khaled Al Fayeed.

16:19.160 --> 16:20.900
Okay, so how
do I get it?

16:20.930 --> 16:22.930
You need to
appear in court.

16:22.970 --> 16:24.740
In Abuddin.

16:24.770 --> 16:28.010
Their law requires a
personal court appearance.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.610
Well, the last time
I checked,

16:29.640 --> 16:31.280
we weren't allowed
back in that country.

16:31.310 --> 16:32.940
We can apply for
an exemption...

16:32.980 --> 16:35.450
Sammy's not
going back to Abuddin.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.120
- Um... [scoffs]
- Look, I know you're disappointed,

16:40.150 --> 16:41.890
but there's no way
you're going back there.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.950
Okay, but this is my inheritance
from my father, s...

16:43.990 --> 16:46.690
And I'm your mother and it's
my job to keep you safe.

16:46.730 --> 16:48.260
I'm not gonna put you
at risk for $100 million

16:48.290 --> 16:49.760
- or $100 billion.
- [Sammy] O... Okay,

16:49.790 --> 16:51.960
- can we at least talk about it?
- We just did.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.430
You're not going
back to Abuddin.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.170
Wow.

16:56.270 --> 16:57.940
Okay.

16:57.970 --> 17:01.070
Since when are you the dictator
of this family, Mom?

17:01.110 --> 17:02.210
Sammy...

17:05.079 --> 17:08.000
I'm just... I'm gonna go
finish my homework in my room.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
[moves chair]

17:12.380 --> 17:14.480
I'm sorry about that.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.589
[sighs]

17:15.589 --> 17:17.050
No,
it's... [pats on her leg]

17:17.089 --> 17:21.010
I figured it was
a sensitive subject,

17:21.040 --> 17:22.790
that's why I wanted
to do it in person.

17:22.829 --> 17:24.790
I didn't realize
how sensitive.

17:24.829 --> 17:28.000
We got on a plane
a year ago

17:28.030 --> 17:30.170
to go to a wedding.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.870
We can't go back.

17:33.870 --> 17:35.870
[engine shuts off]

17:39.870 --> 17:41.870
[indistinct conversation]

17:41.870 --> 17:44.480
- [woman speaks with German accent]
- [Daliyah] Hello...

17:44.480 --> 17:46.520
They're here for Daliyah.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.790
Your father is a fool.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.250
A beautiful wife and
he's sending her away?

17:52.290 --> 17:54.660
I think Daliyah's beauty
is crowding our mother's nest.

17:54.690 --> 17:56.120
Shut up, Kasim.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.760
What do you
think, Khalil?

17:58.800 --> 18:01.800
It's not my place.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.580
But you have an opinion.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.270
[sheep bleats in distance]

18:05.270 --> 18:06.630
Well, I think
 it's a good idea.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.640
I think it'll bring
jobs to the village.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.810
Your meat won't go bad
and you'll stop getting sick.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.940
I'd rather be sick
than lose my wife.

18:12.980 --> 18:16.010
Let a curious woman like
her out into the world

18:16.050 --> 18:17.510
and she may
never come back.

18:17.550 --> 18:20.150
Once she leaves here,
forget about her.

18:20.150 --> 18:22.080
[bucket clangs]
[milk splashing]

18:22.080 --> 18:23.790
What the hell?

18:23.820 --> 18:25.230
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

18:25.270 --> 18:25.990
That's good milk.

18:26.030 --> 18:29.660
[pouncing]
Oh!

18:29.690 --> 18:30.930
Hey, wait, wait, wait,

18:30.960 --> 18:32.260
- wait, wait, wait.
- Let go of me!

18:32.290 --> 18:33.430
Ghani, wait.
Ghani!

18:33.460 --> 18:35.300
That kid's a freak.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.100
[gasps]

18:45.100 --> 18:47.100
[door bangs open]

18:56.900 --> 18:58.900
[door opens, hinges squeak]

18:58.900 --> 19:01.640
[door closes]
Mr. President.

19:02.640 --> 19:05.640
[clears throat]

19:07.940 --> 19:10.350
I'm sure this is
awkward for you.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.880
It is for me.

19:14.080 --> 19:17.120
But I'm happy
to meet you.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.120
[Jamal inhales and exhales]

19:21.090 --> 19:23.490
I thought you
might start by...

19:23.520 --> 19:25.590
by giving Rami
a tour of the palace.

19:25.620 --> 19:27.730
Mm. Good idea.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.100
<i>[Jamal] Every one</i>

19:29.130 --> 19:33.070
of these tiles
was hand-laid.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.400
This room, specifically,

19:35.440 --> 19:38.440
took over a year
to complete.

19:38.470 --> 19:42.260
You would think growing up
in a place like this

19:42.300 --> 19:45.080
would be amazing, but...

19:45.110 --> 19:47.110
not really. [sighs]

19:50.110 --> 19:53.110
[blows out air]

19:55.190 --> 19:58.070
Uh... you probably

19:58.100 --> 20:01.530
don't like me
very much. [clicks lips]

20:01.560 --> 20:05.150
My mother always said
nice things about you.

20:07.570 --> 20:09.970
I never understood
why she wasn't angry.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.270
She would have had
every right to be.

20:13.310 --> 20:16.880
But she wasn't.

20:16.910 --> 20:19.610
She loved you.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.180
She was a Rashid

20:24.220 --> 20:26.520
and I was an Al Fayeed.

20:26.550 --> 20:29.030
Even before it started,

20:29.070 --> 20:32.060
our relationship
was impossible.

20:32.090 --> 20:35.800
We tried to run
away together,

20:35.840 --> 20:37.430
like in the movies.

20:37.460 --> 20:40.570
To leave Abuddin
for good.

20:40.600 --> 20:44.640
I bribed a merchant
marine from Mumbai

20:44.680 --> 20:46.800
to let us stow away.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.550
We were supposed
to meet him at a café,

20:49.580 --> 20:51.580
but he never showed up.

20:51.610 --> 20:53.910
My father did, though.

20:53.950 --> 20:56.160
He beat me,

20:56.200 --> 20:58.620
knocked out
three of my teeth.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.050
He said

21:00.090 --> 21:01.600
it would be worse

21:01.630 --> 21:04.590
if we ever
saw each other again.

21:06.860 --> 21:10.940
I never knew about you.
But you were there.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.130
You must have been.

21:15.770 --> 21:18.770
You look like her.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.710
She always said
I look like you.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.740
No, you have her eyes.

21:23.780 --> 21:27.440
She had...

21:27.470 --> 21:29.950
very kind eyes.

21:34.020 --> 21:35.590
Do you shoot?

21:35.620 --> 21:39.290
Of course you do. [chuckles]
You're a soldier.

21:39.320 --> 21:40.790
Well,

21:40.820 --> 21:43.560
let's see if you
inherited my skills.

21:43.560 --> 21:46.560
[gunshots]
[shell casings clang on ground]

21:49.170 --> 21:52.070
You didn't say
you had perfect aim.

21:52.100 --> 21:54.100
You didn't ask.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.510
Where did
that happen?

21:59.540 --> 22:02.310
Um, Darfur.

22:02.350 --> 22:04.780
Tell me.

22:04.820 --> 22:08.150
[gun clicks]
[scoffs] I prefer not to talk about it.

22:08.150 --> 22:10.150
[footsteps approaching]

22:10.950 --> 22:14.020
[Leila] Jamal, I've been
looking for you.

22:15.430 --> 22:19.000
Ahmed's been waiting for you
to review the job reports.

22:19.660 --> 22:21.220
Whew.

22:21.260 --> 22:23.040
Hello.

22:23.070 --> 22:24.280
Meet Rami Said.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.960
Rami, this is
my wife, Leila.

22:25.990 --> 22:27.170
Of course.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.770
It's a... a pleasure.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.170
My pleasure.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.660
Rami is originally
from Abuddin.

22:33.690 --> 22:38.720
Now he's the commander of the UN
peacekeeping force in Mogadishu.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.950
Actually, Mogadishu
was my last deployment.

22:40.980 --> 22:42.920
Right now I'm recruiting
member nations to form

22:42.920 --> 22:44.720
a rapid reaction force
in Burundi.

22:44.750 --> 22:47.390
- Wow. Impressive.
- [Jamal] Yes.

22:47.420 --> 22:49.390
He's like a superhero.

22:49.420 --> 22:51.190
I doubt that.

22:51.230 --> 22:53.560
How do you two
know each other?

22:54.760 --> 22:56.990
Well, I make it
my business

22:57.030 --> 22:59.390
to know Abuddin's finest.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.010
[crunching sound]

23:07.010 --> 23:10.180
It must have been very difficult
for you...

23:10.210 --> 23:12.610
hiding in your
own homeland,

23:12.650 --> 23:16.180
being hunted
like an animal.

23:17.180 --> 23:19.180
[sighs deeply]

23:20.320 --> 23:22.790
Every day...

23:22.820 --> 23:26.960
you're afraid that someone
will break through your door

23:26.990 --> 23:30.300
and shoot you
in the head

23:30.330 --> 23:33.330
or drag you
off to prison.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.740
So where will you go?

23:37.770 --> 23:40.740
Amsterdam.

23:40.770 --> 23:42.340
Where my father is.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.810
Where your father
ran away.

23:47.250 --> 23:50.170
The Europeans,
they all talk about tolerance

23:50.210 --> 23:51.680
and free speech,

23:51.710 --> 23:53.400
but it doesn't include us.

23:54.620 --> 23:58.060
You're running to the very life
I ran away from.

23:58.090 --> 23:59.550
So don't fool yourself
into believing

23:59.590 --> 24:02.630
that Amsterdam will ever be
a home to you.

24:02.660 --> 24:04.630
But...

24:04.660 --> 24:07.670
you don't need me
to tell you that.

24:07.700 --> 24:10.630
<i>[Ihab] Abu Omar.</i>

24:10.660 --> 24:12.070
You have changed.

24:12.100 --> 24:14.770
Two years in Mubarak's prison
changed me.

24:14.810 --> 24:17.380
Still, I would never do
what you do.

24:17.410 --> 24:20.990
What, give the people
a government?

24:21.030 --> 24:23.070
One that actually works?

24:23.110 --> 24:24.530
We give them jobs

24:24.570 --> 24:26.750
and require
only that they follow God's law.

24:26.790 --> 24:29.550
You behead photographers,
journalists, teachers...

24:29.590 --> 24:32.840
Infidels on the wrong side
of history.

24:32.880 --> 24:35.420
And it's been working.

24:35.460 --> 24:37.560
Just like it will work
in Abuddin.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.930
Oh...

24:39.970 --> 24:43.170
It's barbaric.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.430
Barbaric.

24:44.470 --> 24:46.100
It's war.

24:46.140 --> 24:48.440
Between the House of Islam

24:48.470 --> 24:51.240
and the House
of the Unbeliever.

24:51.280 --> 24:53.240
You need
to pick a side.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.890
<i>[Jamal] Did I tell you</i>

24:55.920 --> 24:57.810
he was shot?

24:57.840 --> 25:01.250
An inch further to the left
and he'd be a dead man.

25:01.290 --> 25:02.390
Yes, you told me.

25:02.420 --> 25:04.290
Mmm.

25:04.320 --> 25:07.560
Leila, he's the kind of man
we need around.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.540
I had an idea
today.

25:10.580 --> 25:13.640
I'm thinking
maybe I should offer him

25:13.670 --> 25:15.830
a position
in the Army.

25:15.870 --> 25:18.980
Well, you told me
he was a war hero,

25:19.010 --> 25:21.100
but you didn't tell me
he was a Rashid.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.510
Maybe you forgot.

25:23.540 --> 25:25.860
You seemed so taken
with him, I had Tariq

25:25.890 --> 25:28.480
run a background check.

25:28.510 --> 25:32.600
Um, I'm not
taken with him. [zips his pants]

25:32.640 --> 25:34.420
He's a Rashid.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.950
A distant cousin
by marriage.

25:36.990 --> 25:39.290
He doesn't identify
with them.

25:39.320 --> 25:42.630
He's lived his entire life
abroad.

25:42.660 --> 25:45.460
What's going on, Jamal?

25:45.490 --> 25:50.300
[belt buckle clangs]    Clearly, there's
something you're not telling me.

25:50.330 --> 25:53.300
You think you
know everything.

25:53.340 --> 25:55.870
You can't just walk away from me
like that.

25:55.870 --> 25:57.140
I know you're hiding
something.

25:57.170 --> 25:59.770
I know when you're lying.
I know you too well.

26:00.840 --> 26:03.950
He's my son.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.980
He is my son.

26:10.320 --> 26:12.290
Your son.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.260
Yes.

26:15.290 --> 26:18.260
I'm sorry. Uh...

26:18.260 --> 26:20.730
[scoffs] What does that
even mean?

26:20.760 --> 26:24.070
It was before us,
before...

26:24.100 --> 26:26.670
before you and me.

26:26.700 --> 26:28.740
So you've been lying to me
all these years?

26:28.740 --> 26:31.740
No. I didn't know about him
until earlier today.

26:31.770 --> 26:34.840
My mother kept
him from me.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.740
She is the liar.

26:36.780 --> 26:39.350
One of...
Probably a...

26:39.380 --> 26:41.900
a dozen bastard
children show up

26:41.930 --> 26:43.850
with your meddling mother,
and you...

26:43.890 --> 26:46.520
you want to make him
a member of our family.

26:46.550 --> 26:48.890
He is an
extraordinary man.

26:48.920 --> 26:52.190
He's an extraordinary man
without you, Jamal.

26:52.230 --> 26:54.490
Without you.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.400
I know you've been
unfaithful.

27:01.440 --> 27:04.370
But we had
an agreement,

27:04.410 --> 27:07.640
an understanding.

27:07.670 --> 27:10.640
But to bring him home

27:10.680 --> 27:14.380
- and rub it in my face...
- You are overreacting.

27:14.380 --> 27:15.950
And you are being naive.

27:21.920 --> 27:25.920
I have given you...
[voice breaking] everything.

27:25.960 --> 27:30.600
[sobbing] I have given you
 everything, Jamal.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.200
But all you ever do
is think about yourself.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.050
Jamal wants
and Jamal needs...

27:39.090 --> 27:41.440
- He's my son.
- You have

27:41.470 --> 27:44.140
one son. One.

27:45.480 --> 27:49.650
Your bastard child
is not welcome in my home.

27:54.190 --> 27:57.590
I will make my decision.

27:57.620 --> 28:00.630
I will make
the right decision,

28:00.670 --> 28:03.840
and the world will live with it.
[watchband clicks]

28:04.840 --> 28:06.840
[sighs deeply]

28:07.340 --> 28:09.340
[footsteps departing]

28:14.100 --> 28:16.700
[crickets chirping]
[dog barks in distance]

28:16.700 --> 28:19.700
[water splashing]

28:19.700 --> 28:23.550
[squashing sound]

28:23.550 --> 28:25.100
<i>- [Sammy] Come on!
- [Emma] What are you</i>

28:25.140 --> 28:27.270
- video-ing me for? Stop it.
- [Sammy] "Video-ing."

28:27.300 --> 28:29.190
- [Sammy] That's a word, right?
- [Sammy and Emma] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:29.230 --> 28:31.000
- All right, let's go.
- How does this feel?

28:32.980 --> 28:35.810
[Emma] Look, Mom's actually
doing the dishes.

28:35.810 --> 28:38.810
[laughs from the video]

28:42.320 --> 28:43.990
[Bassam] I'm driving
Grandma home.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.220
[Molly] Okay.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.620
[Daliyah] Ghani!

28:49.660 --> 28:50.930
[Daliyah] Ghani!

28:53.000 --> 28:56.030
Have you seen Ghani?
He's been gone all afternoon.

28:56.070 --> 28:57.970
Munir told me
what happened at the shed.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.800
No, I haven't
seen him since.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.170
I need
to find my son,

29:01.200 --> 29:02.900
so I can tell him
I'm not going anywhere.

29:02.940 --> 29:04.770
I was crazy
to think this would ever work.

29:04.770 --> 29:05.870
I don't think
it was crazy. To...

29:05.910 --> 29:07.440
Who are you
to give me advice?

29:07.480 --> 29:08.540
Daliyah.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.910
He tells me to leave

29:09.950 --> 29:11.650
when his own family
doesn't know he's alive,

29:11.680 --> 29:13.350
hiding in a place

29:13.380 --> 29:15.350
that isn't even his home.

29:15.380 --> 29:18.490
- Ghani!
- I'm sorry.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.920
She shouldn't
have spoken to you

29:19.960 --> 29:22.590
like that.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.990
<i>[Sammy] Hey, Emma?</i>

29:27.030 --> 29:29.660
- Hmm?
- Some dude's been creeping on my profile.

29:29.700 --> 29:32.700
He's checked it, like,
three times in the last hour.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.950
Well, maybe it's
your BF Abdul.

29:34.990 --> 29:35.490
- [Emma chuckles]
- [Sammy] Mm...

29:35.530 --> 29:38.420
Is that why you want to go
back to Abuddin so bad?

29:38.460 --> 29:41.250
No, it's not him. And that's
not why I want to go back.

29:41.290 --> 29:42.630
Mm-hmm.

29:46.970 --> 29:48.150
Okay. You actually do have

29:48.150 --> 29:50.480
- a stalker from Abuddin.
- [Molly] Hey.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.150
Uh, can I talk to you

29:53.190 --> 29:54.590
for a second?

29:54.620 --> 29:57.180
Yeah. I'll give
you guys a minute.

29:58.160 --> 30:02.360
Listen, I'm sorry
I got so upset before.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.700
I know you've been through
a lot, but I... I have, too.

30:06.730 --> 30:08.000
I know that.

30:08.030 --> 30:09.770
We're just starting to get

30:09.800 --> 30:12.800
our lives back, figuring out
how to be a family again.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.640
I know.
But you're not hearing me.

30:14.670 --> 30:16.970
They've already taken so much
away from us.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.670
- I'm not letting them take this.
- [Molly sighs]

30:19.700 --> 30:22.470
They can take so much more
from you than that.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.720
Anyway,
it's blood money.

30:25.750 --> 30:28.150
Yeah, but it's mine.

30:28.190 --> 30:31.390
And I'm still
an... an Al Fayeed.

30:31.420 --> 30:34.690
Half of me, anyway.

30:34.730 --> 30:37.800
And you may not like that,
but it's true.

30:40.870 --> 30:44.870
Anyway,
I... I... I have homework.

31:04.020 --> 31:06.320
<i>[Bassam] Your mother's got the whole
village looking for you.</i>

31:06.360 --> 31:08.060
She's worried about you.

31:08.090 --> 31:09.890
No, she isn't.

31:09.930 --> 31:12.730
What do you mean?
Of course she is.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.560
She loves you.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.930
Why is she leaving me?

31:16.970 --> 31:19.740
Because she loves you.

31:19.770 --> 31:22.670
Because she wants you
to have a future here.

31:22.700 --> 31:25.110
You and everyone
in the village.

31:26.110 --> 31:28.080
Ghani,

31:28.110 --> 31:31.030
- I promise you
- [Ghani inhales]

31:31.030 --> 31:33.480
- she's gonna come back to you.
- [Ghani exhales]

31:35.060 --> 31:39.090
- [Daliyah] How did you know where to find him?
- We had a whole

31:39.120 --> 31:41.420
conversation
about hiding places.

31:41.420 --> 31:43.190
[grunts in strength]

31:43.190 --> 31:45.100
Your son

31:45.100 --> 31:46.830
asks a lot of questions.

31:46.860 --> 31:51.200
That's because you're
the only one who answers them.

31:54.240 --> 31:57.640
You're the only one who doesn't
get mad at him for asking.

31:57.670 --> 32:00.280
He's a good kid.

32:00.310 --> 32:03.210
You're good with him.

32:03.250 --> 32:06.780
Your children, they were lucky
to have you as a father.

32:06.820 --> 32:11.620
I was not always there for them
when they were Ghani's age.

32:13.160 --> 32:17.060
I was a different person
than I am now.

32:17.090 --> 32:19.760
I'm sorry

32:19.800 --> 32:21.730
for what I said before.

32:21.760 --> 32:24.600
I had no right
to speak to you that way.

32:24.630 --> 32:26.130
You were upset.

32:26.170 --> 32:27.540
Still.

32:27.570 --> 32:30.040
I am sorry.

32:31.310 --> 32:34.680
[clicks tongue] Well,
I am not sorry for what I said

32:34.710 --> 32:37.390
about the
solar program.

32:37.420 --> 32:40.350
You could make a real difference
to people's lives here.

32:40.380 --> 32:44.190
If you change
your mind...

32:44.220 --> 32:47.550
I'll watch over Ghani
while you're gone.

32:48.830 --> 32:50.830
[gasps]

32:50.830 --> 32:53.580
I can't ask you to do that.

32:53.620 --> 32:55.960
You're not asking me.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.030
Six months
is a long time,

32:59.070 --> 33:00.830
and life here
isn't perfect.

33:00.870 --> 33:04.770
Life isn't perfect
anywhere.

33:04.810 --> 33:07.010
But I will stay here

33:07.040 --> 33:09.980
until you come back.

33:15.180 --> 33:18.080
My son won't
replace yours.

33:19.680 --> 33:22.080
[laughs]

33:22.920 --> 33:26.230
No, of course not.
That's, um...

33:26.260 --> 33:28.690
That's way too big.

33:30.730 --> 33:33.500
But this is...
this is small.

33:34.740 --> 33:37.900
This is something
I can do.

33:46.250 --> 33:49.250
So, they just clear out cafes
for you?

33:50.550 --> 33:52.780
Ask all the paying customers
to leave

33:52.780 --> 33:55.290
just so you can have
a cup of coffee?

33:56.690 --> 33:58.690
[laughs]

34:01.790 --> 34:05.000
We could have had coffee
anywhere.

34:05.030 --> 34:07.330
This cafe...

34:07.370 --> 34:10.440
was the last place
I saw your mother.

34:11.940 --> 34:13.940
[Jamal sighs deeply]

34:13.940 --> 34:17.159
I've been thinking, Rami,

34:17.199 --> 34:18.739
about you,

34:18.780 --> 34:22.250
your future.

34:22.280 --> 34:25.719
Maybe you should consider
staying here.

34:25.750 --> 34:27.590
In Abuddin?

34:27.620 --> 34:30.020
If you stay,

34:30.060 --> 34:32.389
I'll make you...

34:32.420 --> 34:35.260
a very powerful man
in the army...

34:35.290 --> 34:36.790
second-in-command.

34:39.199 --> 34:42.429
This isn't why my grandmother
introduced me to you, is it?

34:48.440 --> 34:51.670
I had no intention
of asking you for a job.

34:51.710 --> 34:54.710
You're not asking.
I'm offering.

34:57.710 --> 35:00.680
[exhales deeply]

35:00.680 --> 35:04.050
I'm your father.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.450
This is your home.

35:05.490 --> 35:07.920
My home?

35:09.760 --> 35:12.160
I have no home.

35:14.030 --> 35:16.800
Both sides of my family...
the Al Fayeeds and the Rashids...

35:16.800 --> 35:19.240
have been fighting
since before I was born,

35:19.270 --> 35:22.650
and you are asking
me to choose a side.

35:24.940 --> 35:27.780
There are no
sides anymore.

35:27.810 --> 35:30.180
The fighting is over.

35:30.210 --> 35:32.050
Because
you gassed Ma'an.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.250
It's complicated.

35:39.060 --> 35:41.060
[shivering]

35:44.060 --> 35:47.200
I can't reconcile
being two people at once.

35:47.230 --> 35:50.100
That's why I left.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.330
It's, uh,
why I need to leave now,

35:55.370 --> 35:57.110
but thank you
for the offer.

36:00.110 --> 36:02.110
[sighs]

36:03.180 --> 36:06.670
It was a pleasure
to finally meet you.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.520
You are...

36:11.550 --> 36:14.120
not the man
I expected.

36:17.620 --> 36:21.120
[footsteps departing]

36:23.830 --> 36:26.170
Can't sleep?

36:26.340 --> 36:28.340
[takes a deep breath]

36:28.340 --> 36:31.870
[exhaling]

36:33.110 --> 36:35.240
You're thinking
about Abu Omar?

36:35.280 --> 36:36.980
Hmm.

36:37.010 --> 36:40.580
Mm.
[cigarette sizzling]

36:40.580 --> 36:42.580
Me, too.

36:44.550 --> 36:48.150
What kind of... person

36:48.190 --> 36:53.690
drives people out
of their homes, and...

36:53.730 --> 36:56.100
tortures...

36:56.130 --> 36:58.730
slaughters
innocent people?

36:58.770 --> 37:02.900
Oh, these... these things
that he does.

37:02.940 --> 37:05.700
What kind of person
does these things?

37:05.740 --> 37:08.870
I could.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.910
If Abu Omar...

37:13.950 --> 37:17.320
can open
the palace gates

37:17.350 --> 37:21.550
so I can slit the throat
of Jamal Al Fayeed,

37:21.590 --> 37:25.340
then I will go with him.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.630
Why wouldn't I?

37:29.660 --> 37:32.690
- [Ihab sighs deeply]
- After all the blood he's spilled.

37:36.340 --> 37:38.970
Abuddin is our home.

37:40.510 --> 37:42.610
And this...

37:42.640 --> 37:45.740
is our last chance
to make a stand.

37:47.350 --> 37:49.940
So I could do
those things.

37:50.980 --> 37:53.420
And so could you.

38:00.530 --> 38:03.210
- I'm on your side.
- It sure doesn't feel like it.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.690
It's the law that's
on Sammy's side.

38:05.720 --> 38:06.900
Can I make him stay?

38:06.940 --> 38:08.570
Yes, you can
kidnap him.

38:08.570 --> 38:10.110
[Molly scoffs]

38:10.110 --> 38:13.070
He's gonna be 18,
and as soon as he is,

38:13.100 --> 38:16.220
he can pretty much do
whatever he wants.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.480
At least for now,
you got the wolf by the ear.

38:18.520 --> 38:21.190
So there's no way
I can keep my son safe?

38:21.220 --> 38:22.800
You can go with him.

38:22.830 --> 38:25.520
I promised Barry
we would never go back there.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.730
Sammy didn't make
that promise,

38:27.760 --> 38:31.060
and from what I'm getting,
sooner or later, he's going,

38:31.100 --> 38:32.890
with or without you.

38:32.890 --> 38:34.890
[cup clinks as set down]

38:35.470 --> 38:39.040
If it makes a difference,
I'll be there with you.

38:39.070 --> 38:43.370
I mean, technically,
Sammy's my client, but...

38:43.410 --> 38:45.380
You would do that?

38:45.410 --> 38:47.880
Yeah. One of the
advantages of being

38:47.910 --> 38:50.610
a widowed, self-employed
empty-nester.

38:50.650 --> 38:54.220
Look, when he goes,

38:54.250 --> 38:57.890
you don't want him resenting you
for not being with him.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.320
He's already
lost one parent.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.320
[scoffs]

39:02.630 --> 39:05.300
[Ahmos] I am so proud
of you, Daliyah.

39:05.330 --> 39:08.030
You'll send me reports.

39:08.070 --> 39:09.970
- I want to know how it's going.
- Yes.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.100
Yes. Ahmos, stop.

39:22.650 --> 39:26.150
When I come back,
I will be a solar engineer,

39:26.180 --> 39:29.380
and I'm going to build you
a house with your own bedroom.

39:29.420 --> 39:32.890
Will we be able to switch
the lights whenever we want?

39:32.920 --> 39:35.620
We'll have light
all the time.

39:35.660 --> 39:37.460
Lots of light.

39:37.490 --> 39:39.130
Come...

39:39.160 --> 39:41.190
or you'll miss
your plane.

39:48.190 --> 39:50.190
[sniffles]

40:03.190 --> 40:06.190
[low indistinct conversation]

40:07.190 --> 40:09.190
[car door opens]

40:14.190 --> 40:17.190
[woman with German accent
speaks indistinctly]

40:22.190 --> 40:25.190
[engine starts]

40:25.190 --> 40:28.190
[engine revving]

40:39.320 --> 40:41.710
I decided you were right.

40:43.460 --> 40:45.760
Rami should go.

40:45.790 --> 40:47.960
It's the best thing for me,

40:48.000 --> 40:50.200
the best thing for all of us.

40:50.240 --> 40:54.000
So, good luck to him,
wherever he goes next.

40:56.470 --> 40:59.640
Did you love her?

41:04.040 --> 41:06.580
Rami's mother.

41:06.610 --> 41:09.220
Did you love her?

41:09.250 --> 41:13.660
Yes, um, I did,
very much.

41:14.720 --> 41:17.620
The world
could have ended around us,

41:17.660 --> 41:20.230
and we wouldn't
have noticed.

41:20.260 --> 41:23.500
But
 we were young. [sighs]

41:23.530 --> 41:27.070
Children playing
a fairytale romance.

41:27.100 --> 41:30.670
Yes, I remember
that feeling.

41:30.700 --> 41:33.100
Really?

41:33.140 --> 41:35.570
We never talk
about these things.

41:35.610 --> 41:39.140
Who was he?

41:42.150 --> 41:44.520
No one.

41:44.550 --> 41:46.950
You don't know him.

41:51.950 --> 41:55.950
[shower cabin closes, clatters]

41:59.830 --> 42:02.150
[door opens]
- [Ahmed] The numbers don't add up.

42:02.190 --> 42:05.170
One month, the Chinese plan
on employing 13,000 people.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.940
The next month, those
numbers drop by half that.

42:07.940 --> 42:11.940
[leafs flapping]

42:12.940 --> 42:14.940
[sighs heavily]

42:14.980 --> 42:17.810
They are
construction jobs, Ahmed.

42:17.850 --> 42:19.650
That's the month we plan

42:19.680 --> 42:23.200
to have the local
housing project completed.

42:23.230 --> 42:23.990
Those jobs

42:24.020 --> 42:26.590
were always temporary.

42:27.860 --> 42:30.390
Oh.

42:32.940 --> 42:34.940
[clicks lips]

42:35.400 --> 42:38.740
It's... It's confusing.

42:43.230 --> 42:47.180
Well, let's go through this
together, me and you.

42:52.180 --> 42:54.180
[glass clinks as set down]

42:58.600 --> 43:00.990
[line ringing]

43:00.990 --> 43:03.360
Lea Exley.

43:03.390 --> 43:06.400
Remember when you and the entire
State Department assured me

43:06.430 --> 43:10.630
you'd do anything within your
power to guarantee my safety?

43:10.670 --> 43:13.070
I need you
to facilitate travel.

43:14.270 --> 43:16.810
I'm going back
to Abuddin.

43:16.810 --> 43:18.810
[engine roaring]

43:19.180 --> 43:21.710
[woman with German accent] You will be
studying with women

43:21.740 --> 43:23.350
from all over the world...

43:23.380 --> 43:26.480
Pakistan, India,
Africa, Malaysia...

43:26.520 --> 43:30.990
but you will be the first
solar engineer from Abuddin.

43:31.020 --> 43:33.720
[driver] This is Sergeant Aziz.
I have the minister with me.

43:33.760 --> 43:36.450
Please come in, base seven.
This is Sergeant Aziz.

43:36.490 --> 43:37.690
Please come in.

43:37.730 --> 43:40.190
[German woman] Who's that? What's happening?
[tires screeching]

43:40.190 --> 43:43.190
[car making clanging sound]

43:44.750 --> 43:46.150
[man over radio] This is
base seven. Go ahead.

43:47.430 --> 43:49.910
[man over radio] I repeat,
this is base seven. Come in.

43:49.940 --> 43:53.480
- [over radio] This is base seven...
- [men speak local language]

43:53.480 --> 43:54.340
[gunshots]

43:54.340 --> 43:55.980
[German woman] No!

43:55.980 --> 43:57.980
[shooting continues]

43:57.980 --> 44:01.580
- [man gives order, speaks local language]
- [German woman shrieking]

44:01.580 --> 44:05.580
- [woman whimpering]
- [local men talking continue]

44:05.580 --> 44:08.580
- [man shouting]
- [Daliyah grunting]

44:08.580 --> 44:11.580
[panting]
