WEBVTT

00:06.880 --> 00:08.359
All done. Can we go skating now?

00:08.384 --> 00:10.438
Soon, honey.
Your dad has to finish eating.

00:10.439 --> 00:12.172
Dad eats so slow.

00:13.002 --> 00:14.334
He does, doesn't he?

00:16.438 --> 00:18.941
That's me. I got to go.

00:18.942 --> 00:20.864
I wish you were coming skating with us.

00:20.889 --> 00:22.622
Yeah, well, heaven forbid

00:22.624 --> 00:25.358
your mom has to miss her spa appointment.

00:26.176 --> 00:29.228
Look, I won't be long,
and when I get back,

00:29.230 --> 00:32.598
we'll-we'll do something
really, really fun.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.567
Pinky swear?

00:33.569 --> 00:35.561
Pinky promise.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:53.755 --> 00:55.955
After you.

00:57.826 --> 00:59.225
Got to stay hydrated.

00:59.227 --> 01:02.128
Very kind. Thank you.

01:03.984 --> 01:05.233
Have a good one.

01:50.745 --> 01:52.578
I'm choosing the TV show we watch!

01:56.551 --> 01:58.718
Stay here girls, okay?

02:00.555 --> 02:02.189
Jasmine?

02:16.805 --> 02:20.602
Wow. That was amazing.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.412
And my hunch is.

02:22.414 --> 02:25.020
Extreme Risk Management
brings all of the employees

02:25.022 --> 02:27.411
they're trying to poach here, right?

02:27.413 --> 02:29.786
Very perceptive, Mr. Yates.

02:29.788 --> 02:33.786
Listen, I... I've heard
nothing but great things

02:33.787 --> 02:37.172
about your company, and living
in London would be a trip.

02:37.174 --> 02:38.514
I sense a "but" coming.

02:38.515 --> 02:39.814
No. No "but."

02:39.816 --> 02:41.603
Definitely intrigued.

02:43.586 --> 02:47.454
It would take a lot for me
to actually leave Cri/Res.

02:47.783 --> 02:50.984
You sound like an ace negotiator already.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.447
Beaumont must be rubbing off on you.

02:55.031 --> 02:57.598
Oliver, we are prepared
to make a very large

02:57.600 --> 02:59.700
- financial commitment to you.
- That's a good start.

02:59.702 --> 03:01.381
We also hope that when you come aboard,

03:01.383 --> 03:03.538
you'd be interested in forming

03:03.540 --> 03:06.420
your own team, and then leading it.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.211
Lead my own team?

03:10.924 --> 03:13.552
Have you been given
that opportunity at Cri/Res yet?

03:15.218 --> 03:18.152
No, actually, I...

03:18.682 --> 03:20.121
I haven't.

03:20.123 --> 03:21.589
Well, then, I can count on you

03:21.591 --> 03:24.392
to give our offer
some serious consideration.

03:36.372 --> 03:38.339
Hey, Eric. What's up?

03:38.341 --> 03:39.907
You're still in London?

03:39.909 --> 03:41.709
Listen, Maxine's working out

03:41.711 --> 03:43.611
at Cri/Res, and Zara's dealing
with morning sickness,

03:43.613 --> 03:46.616
so I need you to jump on a plane
and get to Vienna right away.

03:46.618 --> 03:47.763
Vienna? What's going on?

03:47.765 --> 03:49.476
I'll brief you when you get there.

03:49.478 --> 03:51.419
All right. Bye, Ollie.

03:52.655 --> 03:54.722
Oui, monsieur.

04:19.514 --> 04:21.880
This must all be
very upsetting, Mr. Bradshaw.

04:21.882 --> 04:23.549
As consular affairs agent

04:23.551 --> 04:25.536
for the U.S. Embassy, I can connect you

04:25.538 --> 04:26.996
with the Viennese police.

04:26.997 --> 04:28.597
It's not that I don't want to.

04:28.599 --> 04:30.565
I just don't have a choice.

04:33.504 --> 04:36.071
Okay, well, if-if you don't
want me to do that,

04:36.073 --> 04:38.106
there isn't a lot I can do.

04:38.108 --> 04:39.148
Which is why he called us.

04:39.945 --> 04:41.677
Actually, I called you guys

04:41.679 --> 04:44.146
because it's my company protocol
for international emergencies.

04:44.148 --> 04:46.615
What exactly do you do
at Surge-Core Energy?

04:46.617 --> 04:49.484
I'm an accountant. I...
We all get the handbook.

04:50.941 --> 04:52.227
I'm sorry, Mr. Smith.

04:52.229 --> 04:53.579
Was there something more

04:53.581 --> 04:55.101
you wanted to add before we take over?

04:55.987 --> 04:57.726
No. I'm-I'm done.

04:58.796 --> 05:00.696
I'll be in touch, Mr. Bradshaw.

05:05.035 --> 05:07.002
Okay, the message on the mirror...

05:07.004 --> 05:09.271
any idea what the word "it" refers to?

05:09.273 --> 05:11.416
No. None. Trashed room,

05:11.418 --> 05:13.542
the specific yet oblique use
of the word "it" as a ransom,

05:13.544 --> 05:15.377
along with the fact that
you and your family

05:15.379 --> 05:19.014
are 4,800 miles from home
suggests you really should.

05:20.317 --> 05:23.218
I mean, I-I... work
for a small oil company.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.720
I-I don't see the connection.

05:24.722 --> 05:25.787
How about your wife?

05:25.789 --> 05:27.089
She's a diamond broker.

05:27.091 --> 05:29.658
But she was gonna leave
the job after this trip.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.193
All the traveling,
being away from the kids...

05:31.195 --> 05:32.394
it was too much for her.

05:32.396 --> 05:33.795
Diamonds make sense as ransom.

05:33.797 --> 05:35.464
But Jas sells industrial diamonds.

05:35.466 --> 05:36.798
They're not worth much.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.289
She only brought a few samples
and left them in the hotel safe.

05:39.291 --> 05:40.802
So, this trip to Vienna was for work?

05:40.804 --> 05:42.838
For Jasmine, yeah. The girls and I...

05:42.840 --> 05:44.406
we showed up yesterday
morning to surprise her.

05:44.408 --> 05:46.908
She must have been pretty
excited to see you guys, then.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.947
Yeah. Yeah, she was.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.282
First, you really need

05:50.284 --> 05:51.717
to be more honest with us

05:51.719 --> 05:53.418
and stop withholding information.

05:53.420 --> 05:56.221
What? Look, I've told you everything.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.741
Jasmine went to the baths, the
girls and I... we went skating.

05:58.742 --> 06:01.166
You hesitated when asked if
your wife was excited to see you

06:01.168 --> 06:02.637
in Vienna.

06:05.515 --> 06:06.573
Jasmine and I...

06:06.575 --> 06:08.083
we had a fight last night.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.319
You fight a lot?

06:13.157 --> 06:15.025
For the last couple years, yeah.

06:15.893 --> 06:18.527
All her traveling the world,

06:18.529 --> 06:21.430
me not knowing where she was,
her being secretive...

06:21.432 --> 06:22.531
Thought maybe she was having an affair?

06:22.533 --> 06:24.075
For a while, yeah.

06:24.568 --> 06:27.569
But when she said
she was gonna quit her job,

06:27.571 --> 06:29.605
I let it go.

06:29.607 --> 06:31.940
But when we showed up yesterday,
she wasn't excited.

06:31.942 --> 06:33.709
She was... she was angry.

06:33.711 --> 06:34.877
She thought you were checking up on her.

06:34.879 --> 06:36.545
Maybe I should have been.

06:36.547 --> 06:37.846
I made reservations

06:37.848 --> 06:39.982
to kick off the vacation with a dinner.

06:40.508 --> 06:43.252
Last minute, she got a work
call, said she had to bail.

06:43.254 --> 06:44.920
Bringing back your suspicions.

06:47.265 --> 06:48.490
May I?

06:52.796 --> 06:54.496
Hello?

06:54.498 --> 06:57.041
Downstairs. Backdoor. Now.

06:58.369 --> 07:01.036
Okay, sit tight. We've got this, okay?

07:02.155 --> 07:03.772
Neil definitely fits the profile

07:03.774 --> 07:06.174
of the jealous, untrusting spouse.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.766
That said, it actually could
be someone after diamonds.

07:08.768 --> 07:10.412
Maybe, but then
the ransom note would've read,

07:10.414 --> 07:12.781
"Hand them over," not "Hand it over."

07:12.783 --> 07:14.876
I'm not sure that's what they're after.

07:22.927 --> 07:25.594
I take it you're
who we spoke with on the phone.

07:25.596 --> 07:28.163
- My name is Eric...
- Do you have it?

07:28.165 --> 07:30.619
First, I need proof that Jasmine's alive.

07:30.621 --> 07:32.444
Believe me, she will be fine,

07:32.469 --> 07:34.770
as long as you give us what we ask.

07:34.772 --> 07:36.405
Yeah, that's not how this works.

07:38.709 --> 07:39.942
That's a nice gun.

07:39.944 --> 07:42.678
Unfortunately, using it
will not get you what you want.

07:45.249 --> 07:47.049
Put it on.

07:49.687 --> 07:51.501
- Hey, hey, if you think...
- I'm fine, Oliver.

07:51.503 --> 07:53.288
Relax, treat yourself
to a massage or something.

07:53.290 --> 07:55.123
I don't know, check out the spa maybe.

08:10.674 --> 08:12.574
Please.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.243
Please, I don't know what you want.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.812
I have a family.

08:16.814 --> 08:18.680
Look, you have the wrong person.

08:18.682 --> 08:20.315
Please, just let me go.

08:20.317 --> 08:21.985
Please.

08:26.457 --> 08:28.390
I'm sorry, I-I don't recall.

08:28.392 --> 08:31.259
She could have been here,
but with all the commotion

08:31.261 --> 08:33.260
this morning, it's hard to remember.

08:33.263 --> 08:34.462
What commotion?

08:34.465 --> 08:36.030
Um, some lady passed out.

08:36.033 --> 08:38.299
Probably overdid it in the baths.

08:38.302 --> 08:40.302
You know the type.

08:40.304 --> 08:41.703
The ones who don't like to exercise,

08:41.705 --> 08:44.973
so they try and sweat off
the last burger they ate.

08:44.975 --> 08:46.375
Right. Burger sweaters.

08:46.377 --> 08:47.927
Of course.

08:48.846 --> 08:50.912
You see those security cameras?

08:50.914 --> 08:52.614
- Yeah.
- Can you access

08:52.616 --> 08:54.683
the footage to the-the hallways
and the baths?

08:55.682 --> 08:57.716
You want security footage from our baths?

08:57.718 --> 09:00.476
Our clients expect to come
here without worrying about...

09:00.478 --> 09:03.759
Okay, how's, 500 euros?

09:03.761 --> 09:05.293
Um...

09:05.295 --> 09:09.664
Make it a thousand, and I will
throw in a facial scrub.

09:14.358 --> 09:15.504
What do you need, Yates?

09:15.506 --> 09:16.738
A thousand euros would be nice.

09:16.740 --> 09:17.739
What?

09:17.741 --> 09:18.740
Never mind.

09:18.742 --> 09:20.876
I just scored footage from the spa.

09:20.878 --> 09:22.711
Can you check it for anything suspicious?

09:22.713 --> 09:25.013
Also, I need CCTV footage

09:25.015 --> 09:26.948
from the outside location,
if you can grab it.

09:26.950 --> 09:28.850
"If" I can grab it.
I'll call you back as soon

09:28.852 --> 09:31.053
- as I have something.
- Okay, cool.

09:31.055 --> 09:32.087
Are we gonna say good-bye

09:32.089 --> 09:33.255
like civilized people, or just hang up

09:33.257 --> 09:35.090
like they do in the movies?

09:35.092 --> 09:40.162
Listen, Max, I'm, thinking
about leaving Cri/Res.

09:40.164 --> 09:42.464
I've been headhunted by another firm.

09:42.466 --> 09:44.150
Wow...

09:44.935 --> 09:46.301
What does Eric think?

09:46.303 --> 09:47.936
Well...

09:47.938 --> 09:50.572
You haven't told him. I get that.

09:50.574 --> 09:53.075
Eric knows you're the most
valuable member of his team.

09:53.077 --> 09:55.777
Sure, that's what he says. You know Eric.

09:55.779 --> 09:58.647
He's a master at telling people
what they need to hear.

09:58.649 --> 10:00.982
You mean like you are, Mr. Profiler.

10:00.984 --> 10:02.117
Come on, I'm not like that.

10:02.119 --> 10:03.118
Neither is Eric.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.486
Yeah?

10:04.488 --> 10:06.388
Then how come I can read anyone,
but I can't read him?

10:06.390 --> 10:07.689
It's 'cause Eric is always on,

10:07.691 --> 10:09.553
saying and doing what's best for the job,

10:09.555 --> 10:11.471
and what's best for the job
is best for Eric,

10:11.473 --> 10:14.596
which has not included
letting me run my own team.

10:14.598 --> 10:15.831
Fair enough.

10:15.833 --> 10:19.134
Just don't go making any rash decisions.

10:19.136 --> 10:21.937
I'd hate to see you leave
for the wrong reasons.

10:21.939 --> 10:24.641
It almost sounds like
you care about me or something.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.318
Or something.

10:26.343 --> 10:28.610
Bye, Max.

11:05.048 --> 11:06.691
Eric Beaumont.

11:07.558 --> 11:09.084
Call me Gottfried.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.020
I understand you want to see your woman.

11:12.022 --> 11:13.698
I appreciate that.

11:24.935 --> 11:28.203
You have the wrong person. Let me go.

11:31.216 --> 11:33.408
Now you give me what I want.

11:33.410 --> 11:35.510
That woman, her name is Jasmine Bradshaw.

11:35.512 --> 11:37.014
She has a husband and two children.

11:37.039 --> 11:38.662
- Let me talk to her.
- I can't let you do that.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.016
The ransacked hotel room
and quick follow-up calls

11:41.018 --> 11:42.929
suggest you're in
a time-sensitive situation.

11:42.931 --> 11:45.053
Now, the best way
for this to move quickly

11:45.055 --> 11:46.855
is to let me talk to Jasmine.

11:57.334 --> 11:59.434
Hey, Jasmine. My name is Eric Beaumont.

11:59.436 --> 12:01.503
Your husband hired me to help you.

12:01.505 --> 12:04.439
I want to go home.
I want to see my family.

12:04.441 --> 12:06.341
They keep asking me for something.

12:06.343 --> 12:08.410
I don't know what they're talking about.

12:08.412 --> 12:10.078
- The diamonds?
- They can have them.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.580
- Th-Th...
- Enough!

12:12.994 --> 12:14.759
Eric.

12:14.761 --> 12:16.751
Tell him that I really did love him.

12:22.058 --> 12:23.725
All right, look, I know
you're not gonna let us

12:23.727 --> 12:26.461
just walk out of here,
so I want to make you an offer.

12:26.463 --> 12:28.964
Jasmine is a diamond broker.
We're in a...

12:30.767 --> 12:32.569
Walk.

12:34.771 --> 12:36.239
Sure.

12:50.254 --> 12:52.320
She, too, has people who need her,

12:52.322 --> 12:53.755
and she's going to die in 12 hours

12:53.757 --> 12:55.257
without the antidote for the poison

12:55.259 --> 12:58.261
your diamond broker
slipped her at the spa.

13:00.805 --> 13:02.565
Maybe there isn't one.

13:02.567 --> 13:05.400
CIA always has an antidote
in case innocent victims

13:05.402 --> 13:07.068
come into contact with the poison.

13:07.070 --> 13:09.466
You will give it to me.

13:09.491 --> 13:13.475
If you don't, diamond broker
dies, and so do you.

13:14.569 --> 13:16.077
I don't have it.

13:19.116 --> 13:21.549
As a businessman, I don't like
my time being wasted.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.719
But I can get it.

13:27.357 --> 13:29.357
We both want the same thing.

13:29.359 --> 13:30.997
You want the woman
in front of us to live.

13:30.999 --> 13:34.797
I want the one you have
chained to a wall to live.

13:35.999 --> 13:37.732
I'm willing to help if it means

13:37.734 --> 13:39.367
everyone walks out of here alive,

13:39.369 --> 13:42.370
even though I truly believe
that you have the wrong woman.

13:48.512 --> 13:50.412
I don't know many diamond brokers

13:50.414 --> 13:54.683
with cyanide capsules in their teeth.

14:03.826 --> 14:05.427
Her doctor says

14:05.429 --> 14:07.580
my friend here will die in 12 hours.

14:08.398 --> 14:10.065
You have eight.

14:10.067 --> 14:13.134
Call me when you have the antidote.

14:20.769 --> 14:22.135
What do we have?

14:22.137 --> 14:23.919
Maxine analyzed the footage

14:23.921 --> 14:27.074
from the bath and said the
action that we're looking for

14:27.076 --> 14:31.945
is time-stamped 9:07 a.m.

14:31.947 --> 14:35.983
Okay, that's Jasmine and the
woman from the safe house.

14:35.985 --> 14:37.484
There.

14:37.486 --> 14:38.719
You see that?

14:38.721 --> 14:40.687
She could've slipped
something in her drink.

14:40.689 --> 14:43.156
And I'm betting it's not vitamin D.

14:43.158 --> 14:46.293
This is two minutes later.
Poison's taken effect.

14:48.464 --> 14:49.863
I know this guy.

14:49.865 --> 14:52.232
He was at the safe house
where Jasmine's being held.

14:52.234 --> 14:53.852
Do we have an I.D. on the woman
that she poisoned?

14:53.854 --> 14:56.903
Yeah. Maxine identified her as

14:56.905 --> 14:58.972
Marina Lechner, Austrian.

14:58.974 --> 15:01.637
Waitress at a local pub, der Kluge Hans.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.910
All spies have handlers,

15:03.912 --> 15:05.888
someone who manages their missions.

15:06.482 --> 15:08.582
I'm betting Jasmine's handler
has the antidote.

15:08.584 --> 15:09.697
Maybe her husband?

15:09.699 --> 15:11.084
If he's not her handler,

15:11.086 --> 15:13.271
maybe he can lead us to whoever is.

15:13.722 --> 15:14.888
Hey, hold on.

15:15.898 --> 15:18.058
Are you sure we should be
involved in this?

15:18.060 --> 15:19.226
Negotiating the release of a hostage?

15:19.228 --> 15:21.228
Look, Jasmine's an American spy.

15:21.230 --> 15:23.330
We really don't know
what's going on here.

15:23.332 --> 15:26.199
You don't want to end up
on the wrong side of the CIA.

15:26.201 --> 15:29.136
There are two lives at risk
with a ransom connecting them.

15:29.138 --> 15:31.004
In my world, that means we're involved.

15:31.006 --> 15:34.207
If the CIA wants Marina dead,
I'm guessing they have a reason.

15:34.209 --> 15:35.575
Now, I don't know what that reason...

15:35.577 --> 15:36.610
Right. We don't know.

15:36.612 --> 15:38.178
Right.

15:38.180 --> 15:40.113
So, say we get the antidote

15:40.115 --> 15:42.749
and we save Marina and free Jasmine.

15:42.751 --> 15:45.986
What if... what if whatever Marina has

15:45.988 --> 15:48.389
ends up hurting the United States?

15:49.265 --> 15:50.891
We'll be committing treason.

15:50.893 --> 15:52.192
We don't have that information yet.

15:52.194 --> 15:53.293
Exactly, so until...

15:53.295 --> 15:54.979
So until we do,

15:55.004 --> 15:57.206
we're only successful
if we save these women's lives.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.607
This is the track we're on, Oliver.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.742
If you want to get off, get off.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.414
Like a spy?

16:07.042 --> 16:08.955
For the CIA.

16:09.090 --> 16:11.012
A spy?

16:12.013 --> 16:13.922
A-Are they hurting her? Is she okay?

16:13.924 --> 16:17.919
Right now she's fine, and our
plan is to keep it that way.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.329
It was all a lie, all of it...

16:21.331 --> 16:23.398
me, the kids, our life.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.101
How could she keep
something like this from me?

16:26.103 --> 16:28.036
'Cause she had to, for your safety,

16:28.038 --> 16:30.472
for your children's and for her own.

16:30.474 --> 16:33.552
The things Jasmine's involved
in suggests she's deep cover.

16:33.554 --> 16:35.481
There's no way you could've known.

16:35.483 --> 16:39.044
So, if her career was a cover,
w-was everything else?

16:39.069 --> 16:40.267
When I spoke to your wife,

16:40.268 --> 16:41.347
all she could talk about is getting back

16:41.349 --> 16:43.100
to you and the girls.
Right before I left,

16:43.101 --> 16:44.968
she asked me to give you a message:

16:45.446 --> 16:47.740
"Tell him I really did love him."

16:50.866 --> 16:52.310
So, she wasn't having an affair.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.877
Listen, I know this is a lot,
but time is of the essence.

16:54.879 --> 16:57.046
Every spy has a handler,

16:57.048 --> 17:00.917
and finding Jasmine's could be
the key to saving her.

17:01.671 --> 17:03.052
Who did you think your wife

17:03.054 --> 17:05.054
was having an affair with?

17:05.675 --> 17:07.290
I don't know.
I never had a name or a face.

17:07.291 --> 17:08.825
It was just a feeling.

17:08.827 --> 17:11.050
Did Jasmine go anywhere by
herself after you and the girls

17:11.053 --> 17:12.897
- arrived in Vienna?
- We had a fight last night.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.630
It kept her from going to work, so she...

17:19.037 --> 17:22.739
Girls. Girls, listen.

17:22.741 --> 17:24.307
After Daddy left last night...

17:24.309 --> 17:26.309
When you and Mommy were fighting?

17:26.310 --> 17:28.644
Yes, yes.

17:28.646 --> 17:30.546
Did Mommy take you anywhere?

17:30.548 --> 17:33.683
She took us to a-a coffee shop.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.518
Do you remember the name of it?

17:36.289 --> 17:38.154
No. We walked to it.

17:38.156 --> 17:40.821
It had a ice sculpture out front.

17:40.823 --> 17:44.206
We ate cake pops

17:44.208 --> 17:46.799
while Mommy talked to a man.

17:46.801 --> 17:47.830
What did he look like?

17:47.832 --> 17:49.665
A man.

17:55.850 --> 17:57.774
Hey, what you got for me?

17:57.776 --> 17:59.642
Access to the CCTV footage
from outside the spa.

17:59.644 --> 18:01.695
- I'm sending it now.
- Okay, great.

18:01.697 --> 18:04.213
Any more thoughts on jumping ship?

18:04.215 --> 18:06.840
I don't know, man.

18:06.842 --> 18:09.052
You think I could lead my own team

18:09.054 --> 18:10.476
as well as Eric leads this one?

18:10.478 --> 18:12.455
Well, let me ask you this.

18:12.457 --> 18:14.946
- What makes Eric so good?
- He's fearless,

18:14.948 --> 18:18.027
smart, calculating, manipulative,

18:18.029 --> 18:20.963
intuitive, pretty good dresser,

18:20.965 --> 18:23.332
though his suits could stand
a little variety,

18:23.334 --> 18:25.068
if you know what I'm saying.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.770
You're all those things, too.

18:27.772 --> 18:29.605
Yeah? You like those qualities?

18:29.607 --> 18:31.407
In some people more than others.

18:31.409 --> 18:34.177
Okay. Good to know.

18:36.581 --> 18:38.681
You really think whoever Jasmine met here

18:38.683 --> 18:40.316
is gonna show up again?

18:40.318 --> 18:43.419
I'm betting
they have unfinished business.

18:43.421 --> 18:45.888
No one looks suspicious.

18:46.740 --> 18:48.658
Although, after a while,

18:48.660 --> 18:51.561
everyone kind of starts
to look suspicious.

18:51.563 --> 18:53.162
Including the two guys
talking to themselves

18:53.164 --> 18:55.576
and drinking cold espressos.

19:07.679 --> 19:09.879
Check out your two o'clock.

19:15.262 --> 19:16.752
He's looking for something

19:16.754 --> 19:20.656
without looking, feigning
casualness to mask agitation.

19:22.186 --> 19:23.826
That's our guy.

19:28.666 --> 19:29.999
Is this seat taken?

19:30.001 --> 19:31.801
Yeah, actually, it is.

19:31.803 --> 19:34.904
- I'm waiting for, um...
- Your diamond broker?

19:35.282 --> 19:37.240
I think we know the same woman.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.785
Do I look like I know a diamond broker?

19:39.787 --> 19:41.653
No. No, I guess you don't.

19:41.655 --> 19:44.947
Gosh, I wish I could remember her name.

19:44.949 --> 19:46.782
See, I'm worried about her and,

19:46.784 --> 19:48.417
I thought maybe you could help.

19:48.419 --> 19:52.088
Well, if I knew her, maybe
I could, but I don't so I can't.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.719
That's right. Her name was Jasmine.

19:57.262 --> 19:58.294
Rise in body temp.

19:58.296 --> 20:01.030
Tooth made him anxious.

20:10.901 --> 20:14.110
You and Jasmine do
business together, right?

20:14.112 --> 20:17.513
Though you obviously don't
work for the same company.

20:18.325 --> 20:20.321
What can I do for you, Mr...?

20:20.323 --> 20:22.652
Beaumont. After Jasmine's
sales call this morning,

20:22.654 --> 20:24.420
she was supposed to check in with you

20:24.422 --> 20:26.289
and say how it went. Right?

20:26.291 --> 20:28.357
She got busy. Couldn't make the call.

20:28.359 --> 20:30.760
But we made a plan to meet here, anyway,

20:30.762 --> 20:32.481
so I'm hoping she'll show.

20:32.483 --> 20:34.967
Well, I'm sorry, but I've
discovered that Jasmine can't.

20:35.384 --> 20:37.244
She got pulled into another meeting.

20:37.246 --> 20:39.335
Her husband was worried, called me, so...

20:39.337 --> 20:40.570
I'm trying to get her out.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.238
I didn't know she had another meeting.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.673
It was last minute.

20:45.144 --> 20:46.175
The Austrian gentleman

20:46.177 --> 20:48.644
that she's meeting with
needs a pretty specific medicine

20:48.646 --> 20:51.047
for his sick friend
if we want the meeting to end.

20:51.049 --> 20:52.582
I mean, you could almost call it

20:52.584 --> 20:53.749
an antidote.

20:53.751 --> 20:55.918
I thought you might have
something like that.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.201
If I don't get it,

20:57.203 --> 20:58.734
things are going to get

20:58.736 --> 21:00.196
a lot worse for her.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.658
I'm sorry to hear that.

21:03.412 --> 21:06.215
Okay, you're talking
to Keith Taylor from London.

21:06.217 --> 21:07.480
42 years old.

21:07.482 --> 21:09.468
Works at an international mining company.

21:09.470 --> 21:10.601
Keith.

21:12.296 --> 21:14.336
Jasmine's just another coworker to you?

21:15.205 --> 21:16.904
An expendable employee?

21:18.761 --> 21:21.644
Sacrifices are a necessary
part of Jasmine's job.

21:21.646 --> 21:24.146
It's not always pretty,
but it's mission first.

21:24.148 --> 21:25.381
By sacrifices, you mean Jasmine.

21:25.383 --> 21:27.383
I mean any agent.

21:28.813 --> 21:30.326
And the antidote?

21:31.148 --> 21:33.663
Look, this is a "one life
saves ten lives" situation.

21:33.665 --> 21:36.049
In our line of work,
that's a pretty good deal.

21:36.051 --> 21:37.142
And in mine, it's unacceptable.

21:37.144 --> 21:39.152
Well, then I suggest you walk away

21:39.154 --> 21:42.602
and thank God that you decided
on a career in your profession

21:42.604 --> 21:44.133
and not ours.

21:53.671 --> 21:56.612
I need to go to the bathroom.

21:56.614 --> 21:58.801
I need to go to the bathroom.

22:00.351 --> 22:02.151
Look, I'll start screaming
and I won't stop

22:02.153 --> 22:06.255
until you either kill me
or let me go to the bathroom!

22:26.530 --> 22:28.164
I-I need your help.

22:29.247 --> 22:30.780
I can't.

23:43.354 --> 23:45.321
That was a bad choice.

23:55.417 --> 23:57.293
Okay, so,

23:57.295 --> 23:58.853
that guy Keith was CIA?

23:58.855 --> 23:59.995
No.

23:59.997 --> 24:01.270
I suggested he and Jasmine didn't work

24:01.272 --> 24:04.573
for the same company;
His reaction confirmed it.

24:05.048 --> 24:06.139
He's MI6.

24:06.141 --> 24:08.411
British intelligence
working with the CIA.

24:08.413 --> 24:11.680
Did you notice a change
in his speech acceleration

24:11.682 --> 24:13.883
when you called Jasmine expendable?

24:13.885 --> 24:17.753
There was emotion there.
Sadness, maybe guilt.

24:17.755 --> 24:19.155
Agreed.

24:19.157 --> 24:22.158
More than a simple loyalty to the job.

24:23.112 --> 24:24.887
Getting the antidote from him, though,

24:24.889 --> 24:26.529
is the only way we're gonna save Jasmine.

24:27.116 --> 24:28.395
Maxine.

24:28.397 --> 24:30.166
Did you get the exterior spa
footage I sent?

24:30.168 --> 24:31.734
Taking a look at it now.

24:31.736 --> 24:34.399
This is just after Jasmine left the spa.

24:34.401 --> 24:35.711
So that's her car.

24:35.713 --> 24:37.873
Is... is that a tire boot?

24:37.875 --> 24:41.080
Yeah. Can't get far with one of those.

24:41.082 --> 24:43.343
Your car only gets booted
if you have a bunch

24:43.345 --> 24:44.880
of unpaid parking tickets.

24:44.882 --> 24:46.627
Hers was a rental.

24:46.629 --> 24:49.585
Someone knew the car that
Jasmine drove and booted it.

24:50.264 --> 24:51.925
Which suggests she wasn't just kidnapped.

24:51.927 --> 24:54.155
Someone sabotaged her mission
so she'd get caught.

24:54.157 --> 24:55.220
Keith?

24:55.222 --> 24:56.328
Maybe.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.147
Okay, well, keep me posted.

24:59.523 --> 25:01.797
But I also find it weird
that the U.S. would send

25:01.799 --> 25:03.732
a consular affairs agent

25:04.737 --> 25:07.036
to deal with the kidnapping of a CIA spy.

25:07.038 --> 25:09.158
So what are you thinking?

25:09.740 --> 25:12.975
We're gonna pay
the embassy a little visit.

25:15.372 --> 25:16.612
Mr. Beaumont,

25:16.614 --> 25:18.380
Mr. Yates.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.183
Thank you.

25:21.185 --> 25:24.050
- Any news?
- Well, I was hoping

25:24.052 --> 25:25.824
we could talk about Jasmine Bradshaw.

25:25.826 --> 25:28.210
We have information
the CIA may be interested in.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.400
The CIA?

25:29.402 --> 25:32.270
We all know Jasmine is no diamond broker.

25:32.272 --> 25:33.438
She's a spy.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.839
We believe MI6

25:34.841 --> 25:37.197
may have set her up to be kidnapped.

25:37.199 --> 25:38.734
That's a pretty big theory, Mr. Yates.

25:38.736 --> 25:40.020
Yeah, about that. We looked you up.

25:40.022 --> 25:41.713
You have a pretty stellar résumé

25:41.715 --> 25:43.181
for a consular affairs officer.

25:43.183 --> 25:46.996
Graduated high school at 16.
Top of your class at university.

25:46.998 --> 25:48.519
Followed by "two years"

25:48.521 --> 25:50.088
of backpacking across Europe,".

25:50.090 --> 25:51.903
A.K.A. training in Virginia.

25:51.905 --> 25:54.227
You're not a consular
affairs agent, Mr. Smith.

25:54.229 --> 25:58.229
You're CIA, and you can
help us save Jasmine Bradshaw.

25:58.231 --> 25:59.897
Gentlemen, I...

25:59.899 --> 26:04.035
I don't know what to say, other
than... you're misinformed.

26:06.499 --> 26:08.175
Okay.

26:14.814 --> 26:16.981
Would you sign these
documents for me, please,

26:16.983 --> 26:18.783
make sure that they are all registered?

26:18.785 --> 26:20.985
Each page. Thank you.

26:22.183 --> 26:23.630
What was your read on him?

26:23.632 --> 26:26.991
He's confident, driven, self-assured.

26:26.993 --> 26:28.326
Hiding something?

26:28.328 --> 26:29.894
That's hard to say.

26:29.896 --> 26:32.864
If he's CIA, he'd definitely
have the skills to.

26:32.866 --> 26:35.455
You said Keith's cover job
was with a mining company?

26:35.457 --> 26:37.037
Do you have the number?

26:39.339 --> 26:41.939
- Right here.
- Thanks, man.

26:43.677 --> 26:45.810
This is for Keith Taylor.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.680
You should know that
your diamond broker was set up.

26:48.682 --> 26:52.016
For more information,
meet me at the cafe. Now.

26:52.018 --> 26:54.852
So you don't think it was Keith
who set up Jasmine?

26:54.854 --> 26:57.322
I'm not saying that;
It still might've been.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.990
But it might go deeper.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.959
Let's talk to Keith and find out
how much he knows.

27:01.961 --> 27:04.295
Gottfried.

27:08.635 --> 27:09.647
Hello?

27:09.649 --> 27:12.970
I'm moving up the deadline.
You have two hours.

27:14.824 --> 27:16.368
Great.

27:25.936 --> 27:27.419
Mr. Beaumont.

27:27.421 --> 27:29.673
You told me you had some information.

27:34.775 --> 27:36.942
Hey, Keith.

27:39.543 --> 27:41.510
This is Neil.

27:41.512 --> 27:43.228
Jasmine's husband.

27:45.105 --> 27:46.548
What is this?

27:46.550 --> 27:48.016
I know the truth about Jasmine.

27:48.018 --> 27:51.186
That she's a spy and she's been captured.

27:51.188 --> 27:52.654
Mr. Beaumont says you can help.

27:52.656 --> 27:55.023
Sorry, you're mistaken.

27:55.025 --> 27:56.820
Do you know what it's
like to feel helpless

27:56.822 --> 27:58.293
when someone you love needs you?

27:58.295 --> 28:00.462
She sent you a message, right, Neil?

28:00.464 --> 28:01.797
"Tell him I really did love him."

28:01.799 --> 28:05.200
For years, I thought my
wife was having an affair.

28:05.202 --> 28:07.436
I was wrong. I'm asking you,

28:07.438 --> 28:09.538
just give us the information that we need

28:09.540 --> 28:11.006
to save my wife.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.008
Sorry.

28:13.411 --> 28:15.377
You're destroying my family!

28:18.931 --> 28:21.450
Keith. Keith.

28:21.452 --> 28:23.151
You tell me you know Jasmine was set up,

28:23.153 --> 28:24.519
and then you ambush me with her husband?

28:24.521 --> 28:26.254
I needed to rule you out
as the one who did it.

28:26.256 --> 28:28.657
Now I know you couldn't have,

28:28.659 --> 28:29.625
because you love her.

28:29.627 --> 28:30.892
What?

28:30.894 --> 28:32.394
You were having an affair.

28:33.497 --> 28:34.663
Neil's suspicions about his wife,

28:34.665 --> 28:36.698
along with the way
you reacted when I showed you.

28:36.700 --> 28:38.567
Jasmine's tooth, made that pretty clear.

28:38.569 --> 28:41.536
And the affair ended, didn't it?

28:42.573 --> 28:45.674
When Jasmine decided to stop
being a diamond broker,

28:45.676 --> 28:49.077
it meant she was quitting
the CIA and leaving you.

29:00.658 --> 29:02.724
I'm not even part of this mission.

29:03.433 --> 29:05.693
When she got the call to come to Vienna,

29:05.695 --> 29:06.764
she asked me to meet her.

29:06.766 --> 29:09.431
I thought it was a... lover's rendezvous,

29:09.433 --> 29:11.667
but when we had coffee last night...

29:11.669 --> 29:12.934
She confirmed it was over.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.836
She was supposed to let me know

29:14.838 --> 29:16.505
that everything went fine
with her mission.

29:16.507 --> 29:17.773
But that call never came.

29:17.775 --> 29:21.109
Look, if you love her, why not help her?

29:21.111 --> 29:25.013
The woman Jasmine poisoned
stole a NOC list from the CIA.

29:25.015 --> 29:26.915
- Non-official cover agents.
- That's right.

29:26.917 --> 29:30.018
Spies. Ten of them. Memorized.

29:30.020 --> 29:32.954
She survives, she's gonna
sell it to Austrian brokers,

29:32.956 --> 29:35.557
who will sell it to
Russian Foreign Intelligence.

29:35.559 --> 29:38.894
This is moments after
Jasmine poisoned Marina.

29:38.896 --> 29:41.096
The man rushing to her aid is
working with the Austrians,

29:41.098 --> 29:44.066
and this is Courtney Kaplan.

29:44.068 --> 29:46.101
She works at the U.S. embassy

29:46.103 --> 29:48.745
for consular affairs officer Brian Smith.

29:48.747 --> 29:51.039
I know Brian's CIA. See, I'm imagining

29:51.041 --> 29:54.576
Brian tire-booted Jasmine's car
while she was poisoning Marina,

29:54.578 --> 29:56.044
forcing her to flee on foot,

29:56.046 --> 29:58.280
so when Courtney helpfully
points her out,

29:58.282 --> 30:00.115
the Austrians were able to follow her.

30:00.117 --> 30:03.085
I don't know why yet, but
Brian wanted her eliminated.

30:03.087 --> 30:05.290
Jasmine thinks you set
her up. That message,

30:05.292 --> 30:08.023
"Tell him I really did
love him," that wasn't for Neil.

30:08.025 --> 30:09.257
It was for you.

30:11.862 --> 30:14.996
Look, if I could help, I would,
but the NOC list...

30:14.998 --> 30:17.232
Okay, I think I can neutralize
that. Let me ask you this.

30:17.234 --> 30:19.301
Does the CIA have their own list
of Russian agents?

30:19.303 --> 30:21.436
Of course it doesn't matter
whether they do or not

30:21.438 --> 30:23.138
if I can't get the antidote for Jasmine.

30:23.140 --> 30:24.606
There's only one person who'd have

30:24.608 --> 30:27.309
both the list and the antidote.

30:27.850 --> 30:29.549
Brian.

30:31.381 --> 30:33.065
Yeah.

30:55.072 --> 30:56.371
Hi, Courtney.

30:56.373 --> 30:57.706
It's all right.

30:57.708 --> 31:00.342
We're not gonna hurt you.

31:00.344 --> 31:02.410
Do you know her?

31:02.412 --> 31:04.246
- No, I-I don't.
- Well, your microexpressions

31:04.248 --> 31:06.648
and vocal inflections
suggest you're lying.

31:06.650 --> 31:08.850
What were you doing
at the spa this morning?

31:08.852 --> 31:10.118
What, I can't have a spa day?

31:10.120 --> 31:11.453
I'm all about a spa day,

31:11.455 --> 31:13.388
but if you were just
getting a chemical peel,

31:13.390 --> 31:15.074
you wouldn't be acting
so defensive right now.

31:15.076 --> 31:17.425
We know your boss, Brian Smith,

31:17.427 --> 31:18.894
- sent you to the spa.
- Yes.

31:18.896 --> 31:20.395
You agreed because
you're a good employee.

31:20.397 --> 31:21.630
You had no way of knowing

31:21.632 --> 31:23.698
the events you'd be setting in motion.

31:23.700 --> 31:25.233
When you pointed at this woman,

31:25.235 --> 31:28.003
you were telling foreign
adversaries who to kidnap.

31:28.005 --> 31:30.806
Now this wife and mother
is being held for ransom.

31:30.808 --> 31:33.076
This is Marina Lechner.

31:33.078 --> 31:34.309
She look familiar?

31:34.311 --> 31:36.978
She was a waitress
at the pub der Kluge Hans.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.243
If we don't help her,
she will die within the hour.

31:39.245 --> 31:41.341
They both will, okay?

31:44.988 --> 31:47.989
I do Brian's expense reports.

31:47.991 --> 31:50.592
For the last couple of months,
he's been at the bar

31:50.594 --> 31:53.562
where Marina worked almost every night.

31:53.564 --> 31:55.130
Course he has.

31:57.993 --> 31:59.024
Hello?

31:59.026 --> 32:00.235
I am seriously

32:00.237 --> 32:01.203
freaking out right now.

32:01.205 --> 32:02.370
I can't handle this.

32:02.372 --> 32:03.839
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is happening?

32:03.841 --> 32:04.906
Nothing, I just...

32:04.908 --> 32:06.908
I need to talk to someone and come clean.

32:06.910 --> 32:08.877
Maybe if I go to the ambassador, I can...

32:08.879 --> 32:12.180
Hold on. Nobody is going to anyone.

32:12.182 --> 32:13.648
Talk to me. I'll-I'll...

32:13.650 --> 32:15.050
You never told me

32:15.052 --> 32:16.818
what I was doing at the spa, Brian.

32:16.820 --> 32:19.387
The woman that you made me point out,

32:19.389 --> 32:22.057
she has a husband and kids.

32:22.059 --> 32:23.225
I can't deal.

32:23.227 --> 32:24.259
Courtney?

32:24.261 --> 32:25.635
Breathe.

32:26.964 --> 32:28.597
Meet me at Burggarten.

32:29.166 --> 32:31.016
I'll talk you through it.

32:31.969 --> 32:34.469
Everything's gonna be fine.

33:16.158 --> 33:17.725
Drop it.

33:17.727 --> 33:19.159
Whoever you're working for,

33:19.161 --> 33:21.028
I suggest you stand down immediately.

33:21.030 --> 33:23.964
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
Drop the gun.

33:24.527 --> 33:26.767
Drop the gun out the window.

33:33.976 --> 33:36.276
Step out the car.

33:40.082 --> 33:41.949
Mr. Smith.

33:41.951 --> 33:44.118
May I ask why a consular affairs agent

33:44.120 --> 33:45.819
would want to assassinate
his own assistant

33:45.821 --> 33:49.969
in a park on a night
as beautiful as this?

34:00.403 --> 34:03.203
We need the antidote now, Gottfried.

34:10.391 --> 34:12.091
Time is up.

34:17.753 --> 34:20.154
Jasmine Bradshaw,

34:20.156 --> 34:23.174
your agent, was captured
trying to stop a NOC list

34:23.176 --> 34:24.658
from falling into the wrong hands.

34:24.659 --> 34:28.757
How did the NOC
list get out in the first place?

34:29.965 --> 34:33.034
Did you have a favorite
meal at der Kluge Hans?

34:33.036 --> 34:36.132
Or did you just order
whatever Marina recommended?

34:36.134 --> 34:39.418
I didn't know it was
a honey trap. I thought...

34:39.420 --> 34:41.408
That the relationship was real.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.311
Marina really just played you

34:44.313 --> 34:47.614
to steal the NOC list, and
you had to fix your mistake.

34:48.168 --> 34:50.083
I mean, it makes perfect sense.

34:50.085 --> 34:52.652
Kill Marina and then the agent
tasked with doing so,

34:52.655 --> 34:56.356
so there could be no chance
anyone could ever find out.

35:21.723 --> 35:23.053
None of this matters.

35:23.055 --> 35:25.219
Marina still has
the NOC list in her head.

35:25.221 --> 35:27.321
She needs to die.

35:27.323 --> 35:29.205
This is about keeping America safe.

35:29.207 --> 35:30.824
Don't you dare try to act righteous

35:30.826 --> 35:32.426
by wrapping yourself in the flag.

35:32.428 --> 35:34.528
This is about you
covering up your mistake.

35:34.530 --> 35:38.119
Give us the antidote for Marina, please.

35:39.568 --> 35:41.535
- I can't do that.
- Sure you can.

35:41.537 --> 35:43.904
The CIA have their own NOC list
of Russian agents

35:43.906 --> 35:46.234
working in the West, agents they track,

35:46.236 --> 35:48.775
follow, feed misinformation to.

35:48.777 --> 35:51.011
You're gonna show the Russians that list.

35:51.013 --> 35:53.380
You will explain to them

35:53.382 --> 35:56.350
that if they harm
anyone on Marina's list,

35:56.352 --> 35:59.186
the CIA will do the same
to the Russian agents.

35:59.188 --> 36:00.621
And then both sides

36:00.623 --> 36:02.723
will quietly pull their agents
out of the field.

36:02.725 --> 36:05.692
Do you know long it takes
to cultivate those agents?

36:05.694 --> 36:08.395
You're trying to save
your career. We're beyond that.

36:08.397 --> 36:10.197
We have four witnesses
to this conversation

36:10.199 --> 36:11.865
and footage of Courtney at the spa.

36:11.867 --> 36:14.043
I'm pretty sure she'll testify if asked.

36:14.614 --> 36:16.103
We don't need to say anything

36:16.105 --> 36:18.076
about what you tried to do to Jasmine.

36:18.707 --> 36:20.507
But if you don't, you will spend

36:20.509 --> 36:24.332
the rest of your life in prison
for murdering your own agent.

36:26.182 --> 36:28.815
It's your only way out, Brian.

36:51.207 --> 36:53.006
Hello?

37:18.428 --> 37:20.005
- What is he doing?
- Jasmine, Jasmine.

37:20.469 --> 37:22.056
It's okay.

37:51.861 --> 37:53.066
All right.

38:08.150 --> 38:09.850
Don't worry.

38:09.852 --> 38:12.019
The NOC list has been neutralized.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.824
He's telling the truth, I promise.

38:18.237 --> 38:20.060
I'm sorry I thought you set me up.

38:20.062 --> 38:21.595
Jas, it's all right. I understand.

38:21.597 --> 38:23.797
But you've got to know
I'd never betray you.

38:23.799 --> 38:26.120
I really did love you.

38:46.322 --> 38:48.822
"The unicorn soon came towards him,

38:48.824 --> 38:51.792
"and rushed directly on the tailor

38:51.794 --> 38:53.827
"as if it would spit him in its horn

38:53.829 --> 38:55.896
"without more ceremony.

38:55.898 --> 38:57.764
"'Softly, softly,

38:57.766 --> 39:00.638
it can be done as quickly
as that.' said he."

39:24.066 --> 39:25.332
Thank God.

39:27.703 --> 39:30.603
I'm so sorry.

39:30.605 --> 39:33.773
I'm so sorry I haven't
been honest with you.

39:33.775 --> 39:36.441
We have lots to talk about,

39:36.926 --> 39:39.326
but I'm happy you're safe.

39:39.351 --> 39:40.850
I love you.

39:41.249 --> 39:43.616
Mommy!

39:43.618 --> 39:45.118
Mommy, Mommy!

39:46.989 --> 39:50.824
Thank you. Thank you.

39:57.532 --> 39:59.311
Something on your mind, Yates?

39:59.313 --> 40:02.383
Me? Nah, I'm good.

40:03.271 --> 40:05.472
Good, good, good.

40:07.563 --> 40:09.599
Okay, here's the thing.

40:10.399 --> 40:13.934
I was offered a job by
Extreme Risk Management

40:13.959 --> 40:15.396
in London.

40:16.144 --> 40:21.114
It was a good offer,
and I'd have my own team.

40:22.931 --> 40:25.798
I've been struggling
a little bit with...

40:29.619 --> 40:31.431
You already knew this, didn't you?

40:32.580 --> 40:34.630
How?

40:34.632 --> 40:36.469
You've been kind of standoffish all day.

40:36.471 --> 40:39.826
It was either a job offer
or you met someone.

40:39.828 --> 40:43.299
No, definitely job offer.

40:44.012 --> 40:46.246
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?

40:46.248 --> 40:48.137
I guess I didn't want to influence you.

40:48.850 --> 40:52.225
I don't want to see you go,
but you deserve the opportunity.

40:52.788 --> 40:54.268
I appreciate that.

40:55.457 --> 40:58.458
But I don't know if I could've
done what you did today.

40:59.106 --> 41:00.860
I was questioning whether
we should be involved

41:00.862 --> 41:02.044
in the case at all.

41:02.046 --> 41:03.730
You're just seeing things
from all angles.

41:03.732 --> 41:05.198
I think you conducted yourself
exceptionally well.

41:05.200 --> 41:07.460
Still, if you listened to me,

41:07.462 --> 41:10.409
those girls wouldn't have been
reunited their mother.

41:11.666 --> 41:14.867
Plus, Cri/Res is like my family.

41:15.581 --> 41:17.243
I'm not taking the job.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.955
You already knew that, too, didn't you?

41:22.957 --> 41:25.018
I know everything.

41:25.020 --> 41:26.208
I hate you.

41:26.210 --> 41:27.301
I know.
