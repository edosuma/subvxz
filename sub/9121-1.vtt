05:38.151 --> 05:41.484
Do you have kids? Because they should
come over and meet Mick and Jenn.

05:41.554 --> 05:43.852
Actually, we don't. I was, uh...

05:43.923 --> 05:45.322
- I wasn't able... - Oh. What?

05:45.392 --> 05:48.589
- I know that with a big
move in "conduction"...

05:48.662 --> 05:50.926
with a woman's naturally
fluctuating hormones...

05:50.997 --> 05:52.726
it can leave your skin a wreck...

05:52.799 --> 05:54.767
but you'll find that the Aphrodite line...

05:54.834 --> 05:57.667

Well, thank you.

06:02.275 --> 06:04.175
You're welcome.

06:04.244 --> 06:06.735
Larry, wanna grab a cold one?

06:06.813 --> 06:07.837

06:12.252 --> 06:15.744

06:15.822 --> 06:19.121
These rooms are divine. - Thank you.

06:19.192 --> 06:23.253
You should come over to our house,
and we can talk decor.

06:23.329 --> 06:25.854
Oh, I would love that.

06:25.932 --> 06:30.460
Boy. I'm very "impassionate"
about interiors myself.

06:31.938 --> 06:33.838
So what line of work is your husband in?

06:33.907 --> 06:37.399
Well, you know,
he does a little of this and a little of that...

06:37.477 --> 06:40.708
and mostly he works on keeping me happy.

06:40.780 --> 06:43.442
- Ahh.
- Oh, you're right. This is really a good beer.

06:43.516 --> 06:45.279

06:50.523 --> 06:52.457
Hey, that was a, uh, nice visit...

06:52.525 --> 06:56.256
- with the Symondses today, wasn't it?
- Yeah. It was.

06:56.329 --> 06:59.423
I think that you may
have overdone it a little.

07:00.633 --> 07:03.295
What do you mean?

07:04.738 --> 07:07.070
Uh, "a vision of beauty"?

07:07.140 --> 07:09.199
Aw, come on. I was just having fun.

- Well, I love your enthusiasm.
- Thank you.

07:15.849 --> 07:18.977

07:19.052 --> 07:22.021
Oh, this is a soft, soft bed.

07:22.088 --> 07:26.525

I am,
uh... I'm gonna try to scare up a golf game.

08:32.991 --> 08:36.018
- What are you gonna do?
- Oh, you know, a little mani-pedi...

08:36.095 --> 08:38.893
maybe a facial, get my hair done.

08:38.965 --> 08:41.331
I think we're gonna do really,
really well here.

Good morning.
We should talk about...

16:26.065 --> 16:27.464
- Good morning. What happened...
- Morning.

16:27.533 --> 16:29.467
Good morning.
What happened last night.

16:29.535 --> 16:31.469
Jenn, do you have something to say?

16:31.537 --> 16:33.164
Oh, yeah. I'm so sorry.

16:33.239 --> 16:36.402
You know, you're new and I totally
took advantage of the situation.

16:36.475 --> 16:38.807
I shouldn't do that. I'm so sorry.

16:38.878 --> 16:41.472
This really wasn't covered in my orientation.

16:41.547 --> 16:44.038
- Well, we may not be a normal family...
- You think?

16:44.116 --> 16:45.981
But we do have to operate as a team.

16:46.052 --> 16:47.815
We have a huge opportunity here.

16:47.887 --> 16:50.185
I'd like to see us keep our focus.

16:50.256 --> 16:53.589
- Our first review is in 30 days.
- Gotta sell, sell, sell.

16:53.659 --> 16:57.356
All right. Can I get a ride with you?
- Bite me.

16:57.430 --> 16:59.796
- Kate, this is why I need a car.
- I don't wanna hear it.

16:59.865 --> 17:01.355
Mick, wait.

17:01.434 --> 17:03.368
I'm gonna be late for my hot yoga class.

17:03.436 --> 17:06.496
- Oh, you know, sure. That's really...
- Have a nice day.

17:06.571 --> 17:09.769
You have a nice day too. -

17:27.926 --> 17:31.055

20:10.956 --> 20:12.617
All right, then.

20:12.691 --> 20:15.888
I'm sure you're all eager
to hear your results...

20:15.961 --> 20:18.225
from our first month of sales.

20:19.665 --> 20:21.895
Let's start with Steve.

20:21.967 --> 20:24.435
Total sales in this first month...

20:24.503 --> 20:26.698
up three and a half percent.

20:26.772 --> 20:28.706
Boo-yah!

20:28.774 --> 20:31.436
- All right.
- Here are a few highlights.

20:31.510 --> 20:35.071
Sporting goods,
four percent increase.

20:35.147 --> 20:38.275
Watches, up two percent.

20:38.350 --> 20:42.252
Golf-related merchandise,
three percent.

20:42.321 --> 20:45.916
- Nice.
- Okay, Mick... Overall sales up 16 %.

20:45.991 --> 20:47.151
Yes.

20:47.226 --> 20:49.592
Video games, up 13.

20:49.662 --> 20:51.459
Whoa.

20:51.530 --> 20:54.829
- Sportswear is up 21. - Cool.

20:54.900 --> 20:56.891
Excellent.
Way to open up the market, Mick.

20:56.969 --> 20:58.596
Good work.

20:58.671 --> 21:02.004
And Jenn... Up 14 % overall.

21:02.074 --> 21:05.009
Solid work, my dear. - You did good.

21:05.077 --> 21:07.841
Hey, you're still two down. - Kate...

21:07.913 --> 21:12.680
- Congratulations on being our top producer.
- Thank you.

21:12.751 --> 21:14.981
Up 20 %.

21:15.054 --> 21:16.783
Wow. Okay.

21:18.424 --> 21:20.790
Wow. Thank you. Thank you.

21:20.859 --> 21:22.588
Cosmetics, up 24.

21:27.333 --> 21:29.267
Great form.

21:29.335 --> 21:31.530
- Thank you.

21:35.007 --> 21:37.032
Are you focused?

21:37.109 --> 21:38.940
Am I focused? Yeah, I'm focused.

21:39.011 --> 21:40.876
You know,
you were a great car salesman.

21:40.946 --> 21:43.710
People trusted you and they liked you...

21:43.782 --> 21:45.773
so they bought what you were selling.

21:45.851 --> 21:48.285
But you're not selling things anymore.

21:48.354 --> 21:51.517
To succeed here,
you can't just sell things.

21:51.590 --> 21:55.993
You're here to sell a lifestyle,
an attitude.

21:56.061 --> 21:58.256
- Right. - If people want you...

21:59.431 --> 22:01.695
they'll want what you've got.

22:09.108 --> 22:12.566
Um, do the clients know how this works?

22:12.645 --> 22:16.137
Of course not.
That's why it's called "stealth marketing."

22:16.215 --> 22:17.842
The fact is, we get results.

22:17.916 --> 22:20.214
How we go about that is our business.

22:21.353 --> 22:23.480
The question you have to ask yourself is...

22:23.555 --> 22:27.855
How far are you willing to
go to get what you want?

22:27.926 --> 22:29.917
It's called killer instinct.

22:29.995 --> 22:31.986
If you can find it...

22:32.064 --> 22:34.589
you could have anything you want.

22:34.667 --> 22:36.066
Anything.

22:43.842 --> 22:45.332
Thanks.

22:46.879 --> 22:50.280
I don't think he's got it.
I think we may have to bag him.

22:50.349 --> 22:51.873
No, no. I...

22:51.950 --> 22:54.919
I know he's green.
He just needs some time.

22:54.987 --> 22:57.751
And-And I-I can deal with this.

22:57.823 --> 23:00.087
I warned you not to pick a rookie...

23:00.159 --> 23:02.127
in your first "head of household."

23:02.194 --> 23:05.391
You've known me a long time.
I can handle this.

23:07.566 --> 23:09.761
I'll give you 60 days.

23:09.835 --> 23:12.929
But this is your ass on the line,
not mine.

23:13.005 --> 23:15.371
Thank you.

23:15.441 --> 23:17.636
Thank you. You won't regret it.

23:17.710 --> 23:20.144
We'll see, won't we?

23:24.950 --> 23:26.975
We're in a terrible situation right now.

23:27.052 --> 23:28.246
Why are you talking about spending?

23:28.320 --> 23:29.947
Have you read my new book?

23:30.022 --> 23:32.513
- I have, and I disagree with you completely.
- Oh, okay.

23:32.591 --> 23:35.389
Looks like sales for luxury items have
been up for the last two months.

23:35.461 --> 23:36.894
You think we're in a bull market?

23:36.962 --> 23:38.554
That's what I said.
Spend, spend, spend.

23:38.630 --> 23:39.892
Bull market's around the corner.

23:39.965 --> 23:41.592
I understand that bulls are bad.

23:41.667 --> 23:44.067
Anyone can see how upside-down
the entire market is.

23:44.136 --> 23:45.660
Foreclosures at an all-time high...

23:45.738 --> 23:47.797
That's true. About four million
foreclosed homes this year.

23:47.873 --> 23:49.932
The dollar is on its way up.
I'm telling you.

23:50.008 --> 23:51.942
If you want to spend your way out...

23:52.010 --> 23:54.137
the dollar will end up the
same way as the peso.

23:59.885 --> 24:02.820
- Hey. - Hey.

24:04.523 --> 24:09.961
So we need to step it up, so I've
decided that we're gonna throw a party.

24:10.028 --> 24:13.589
Jesus. Look at Larry.
He is a miserable bastard.

24:13.665 --> 24:16.259
My guess is they sleep
in separate bedrooms.

24:16.335 --> 24:17.825
Yeah, I know how that feels.

24:17.903 --> 24:21.304
This is serious,
and I'd really like you to focus.

24:21.373 --> 24:23.364
- Okay? - Hmm?

24:23.442 --> 24:26.275
I mean,
we really need to pull out all the stops.

24:26.345 --> 24:28.575
I'd like to put our contact list to good use...

24:28.647 --> 24:30.638
and start to showcase all we've got.

24:30.716 --> 24:33.310
It's a good time for me
to wear the YSL dress.

24:33.385 --> 24:35.683
I'd really like to roll out
the Van Cleef earrings.

24:35.754 --> 24:37.881
I think you have some of
those Costume National that...

24:37.956 --> 24:39.821
- Oh, ho, ho, ho.
- Have a chance to...

24:39.892 --> 24:41.621
Thank you.

24:43.595 --> 24:45.620
I really have some things that I'd like...

24:45.697 --> 24:48.029
to-to talk to you...

24:49.334 --> 24:51.598
S-So I...
There's some things that I want...

24:54.406 --> 24:56.431
- Hey, Larry. - Come on. Come on.

24:56.508 --> 24:57.998
- Hey. - Hey.

24:58.076 --> 25:01.068
- I'm on poop patrol here.
- Nice. Mind if I ask you a question?

25:01.146 --> 25:03.080
Hmm?

25:03.148 --> 25:05.639
Think Kate'll like these?

25:07.786 --> 25:10.983
Cha-cha, bling.
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

25:11.056 --> 25:13.820
- What's the occasion?
- No occasion.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.924
- Oh, geez. Summer would love those.
- Yeah.

25:17.996 --> 25:20.692
- Well, business is good, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

25:20.766 --> 25:24.065
- Terrific. Absolutely.
- This is what it's all about.

25:24.136 --> 25:26.195
Yeah. Yeah.

25:26.271 --> 25:29.206
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. You, uh...
Are you gonna play today?

25:29.274 --> 25:31.105
Oh, uh, no.

25:31.176 --> 25:33.667
You know, I pulled...
I kinda pulled a muscle.

25:33.745 --> 25:35.269
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

25:35.347 --> 25:37.713
Kate and I are into this
new tantric sex thing.

25:37.783 --> 25:40.115
I don't know how I got in the...

25:40.185 --> 25:41.812
But it, you know...

25:41.887 --> 25:43.377
- It went too far. - Yeah.

25:45.457 --> 25:47.550
Well, I, uh...

25:47.626 --> 25:50.527
- I sure haven't pulled any muscles lately.
- No?

25:50.596 --> 25:53.360
You know how I keep it fresh
between Kate and me?

25:53.432 --> 25:56.060
Uh, good listening?

25:56.134 --> 25:58.227
No. No, no.

25:58.303 --> 26:00.464
It's about me never really
believing that I have her.

26:00.539 --> 26:03.804
Being full of surprises...
and a steady stream of gifts.

26:20.592 --> 26:22.856
- It's great to see you.
- Hi. How are you?

26:24.730 --> 26:26.391
- Have you tried this yet?
- Yes, and...

26:26.465 --> 26:28.456
I think you're gonna love it.

26:28.533 --> 26:31.195
How are you ladies?
Are you enjoying that Pomtini?

26:31.270 --> 26:33.500
It's good, yeah?

26:33.572 --> 26:36.769
Well, we'll just, uh,
make sure we'll keep 'em coming.

26:38.810 --> 26:42.974
This vodka is either...
It's either from Mexico or Antarctica.

26:43.048 --> 26:45.812
- How are you guys doing?
- Hi. - Hey.

26:45.884 --> 26:48.079
Oh, those earrings are gorgeous.

26:48.153 --> 26:49.984
Thank you. Steve surprised me.

26:50.055 --> 26:52.615
- What was the occasion?
- It was a Tuesday gift.

26:52.691 --> 26:55.023
- Tuesday? - What's a Tuesday gift?

26:56.094 --> 26:58.426
Just for being Tuesday.

26:58.497 --> 27:00.522
- Oh, my. - That's so romantic.

27:00.599 --> 27:03.295
Makes me want a cannelloni. -

27:04.736 --> 27:06.499
- These are delicious. - You like 'em?

27:06.571 --> 27:08.505
- Mm-hmm.
- Who does your catering?

27:08.573 --> 27:10.473
Chef Robert. -

27:10.542 --> 27:11.941
- No. - Really?

27:13.078 --> 27:15.706
Excuse me. Will you show that?

27:18.050 --> 27:20.541
- I didn't know he was doing frozen food.
- Can you believe it?

27:20.619 --> 27:24.487
- Ooh. - You know, we had the most
incredible chicken "fricazini"...

27:24.556 --> 27:26.387
homemade, at the Robustion spring gala...

27:26.458 --> 27:28.255
Oh, I've got to try the sushi.

27:28.327 --> 27:32.024
Ohh! Now, this is one thing
you won't find in your freezer.

27:32.097 --> 27:34.497
Oh, yes, it is.

27:36.902 --> 27:41.464
Wataru flash-frozen sushi.

27:41.540 --> 27:45.704
This is the view from base camp.

27:45.777 --> 27:47.870
I can't believe you actually climbed Everest.

27:47.946 --> 27:49.641
The Sherpas are the key, you know.

27:49.715 --> 27:52.582
You don't wanna do it without the Sherpas.

27:52.651 --> 27:54.084
Man, this system's great.

27:54.152 --> 27:55.676
Yeah, with the bundle of services...

27:55.754 --> 27:57.244
you get the clearest HD picture.

27:57.322 --> 27:59.313
All your personal media Is just a click away.

27:59.391 --> 28:01.154
- You can see it...
- What are you boys up to?

28:01.226 --> 28:03.160
...best HD picture.

28:03.228 --> 28:05.321
Are you showing off your new toy?

28:05.397 --> 28:07.490
Guilty. Yeah.

28:12.270 --> 28:15.330
And... who's your favorite toy?

28:17.009 --> 28:18.601
You are.

28:19.611 --> 28:21.602
Mm-hmm.

28:26.251 --> 28:28.242
All right,
can I get you guys another...

28:28.320 --> 28:30.515
No, no. I'm good.
It's a little hot in here.

28:30.589 --> 28:32.250
Thank you.

28:32.324 --> 28:34.417
- Maybe a big boy drink?
- No, I'm good, thank you.

28:34.493 --> 28:37.428
Do you want something?
- Um, I'm-I'm...

28:37.496 --> 28:39.191
Nice.

28:43.135 --> 28:44.432
Where were we? -

28:44.503 --> 28:46.528
Watch for the guy on the top right now.

28:46.605 --> 28:48.129
- All right.
- Shoot him. Shoot him now.

28:49.341 --> 28:51.070
Oh, awesome!
- Told you this was easy.

28:56.982 --> 29:00.247
What kind of shit did your
parents do to get you that thing?

29:00.318 --> 29:03.549
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, I know a guilt gift when I see one...

29:03.622 --> 29:05.886
and that one's got "I'm sorry
for being a fucked-up parent"...

29:05.957 --> 29:07.891
written all over it.

29:07.959 --> 29:10.860
Yeah, I guess so.

29:10.929 --> 29:12.487
- I'm Naomi. - Mick.

29:12.564 --> 29:13.963
- I know. - Hmm?

29:14.032 --> 29:15.795
You have this whole cult following at school.

29:15.867 --> 29:18.097
- I do? - Yeah.
You've been there, what, two months?

29:18.170 --> 29:19.899
Everyone's drinking your Kool-Aid.

29:22.407 --> 29:24.967
So, why are you here?
You a friend of Jenn's?

29:25.043 --> 29:27.671
Yeah, right. Yeah.
Can't you see me with that crowd?

29:27.746 --> 29:29.976
Mmm.

29:30.048 --> 29:32.107
- Nah. - No, not really.

29:32.184 --> 29:34.277
- I'm here with my parents. - Mmm.

29:36.488 --> 29:38.979
Wanna get high?

29:40.525 --> 29:42.516
Sure. Yeah.

29:46.865 --> 29:48.833
- Wow. - Oh, yeah.

29:48.900 --> 29:51.835
Well, it must be really big
to be called "the hammer."

29:51.903 --> 29:54.770
Well, yeah. I'd love to show it to you.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.637
Really?

29:56.708 --> 30:00.269
Yeah.
You'll have to stop by the marina one day...

30:00.345 --> 30:03.371
- soon. - I would love to.

30:03.448 --> 30:05.382
That'd be great.

30:05.450 --> 30:08.851
Yeah. You know what?
I'm gonna have to go.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.684
Well, it was nice meeting you,
Mr. Bayner.

30:11.756 --> 30:13.690
You too. Bye, now.

30:15.260 --> 30:18.627
Oh, there you are, sweetheart.
How's it going? You have a good time?

30:18.697 --> 30:20.062
And her hair was not...

30:22.200 --> 30:24.498
Yeah.

30:27.372 --> 30:30.739
- What are you doing? - Mingling.

30:32.110 --> 30:35.637
Maybe you might wanna go
and show the girls your room.

30:35.714 --> 30:37.204
Yay.

30:38.783 --> 30:41.013
How are you guys doing? -

30:41.086 --> 30:42.917
This sushi is incredible.

30:42.988 --> 30:45.422
- You guys are so wonderful.
- Nobody throws a party like you do.

30:45.490 --> 30:48.084
Well, we'll have to do it again. -

30:48.160 --> 30:50.856
Troublemaker.
- Hey, look who's here.

30:50.929 --> 30:53.591
You know who this is.
The lady of the evening.

30:53.665 --> 30:55.656
- Hey, Naomi? - Mm-hmm.

30:55.734 --> 30:58.726
Do you wanna know why all those
people are in my house right now?

30:58.803 --> 31:02.261
It's a party. Duh. - Yeah.

31:02.340 --> 31:06.106
No, it's so my so-called "family"...

31:06.178 --> 31:08.703
can show off all their shit.

31:08.780 --> 31:11.772
And you know all those people...

31:11.850 --> 31:14.978
are fucking blown away by it all.

31:15.053 --> 31:16.987
Yeah.

31:17.055 --> 31:19.888
That sounds like something
my parents would do.

31:22.494 --> 31:25.759
- Aren't you two the sexy couple?
- Oh.

31:25.830 --> 31:28.390
Don't forget about lunch next week.

31:28.466 --> 31:30.900
Good night.

31:32.003 --> 31:33.937
- Um... - I, uh...

31:34.005 --> 31:36.974
- I think it went-went great... tonight.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

31:37.042 --> 31:40.603
I mean, I personally didn't feel like I, uh,
connected with Melanie.

31:40.679 --> 31:43.113
I don't know if you...
Did you speak with her husband, Alex?

31:43.181 --> 31:46.014
Don't-Don't... Slow down. Slow down.
It was fine. It was perfect.

31:46.084 --> 31:51.750
You were perfect. You... You know, you
don't realize the effect you have on people.

31:52.991 --> 31:55.016
Thank you.

31:55.093 --> 31:59.086
- Um, just, uh, doing my job. - Yeah.

32:00.765 --> 32:03.290
You might want to lay off the
Robert hors d'oeuvres though.

32:03.368 --> 32:07.805
- Why? What do you mean?
- Oh, God. Loaded in garlic.

32:07.872 --> 32:10.636
- Are you kidding? Really?
- No, not kidding. No, no, no.

32:10.709 --> 32:12.973
- Oh, my God. - Good night.

32:18.850 --> 32:20.818
Some party tonight, huh?

32:20.885 --> 32:22.819
Oh, my God.

32:22.887 --> 32:26.516
That house.
I could die for that dining set.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.694
Think she'll buy any of your products?

32:30.762 --> 32:32.696
They seem to buy everything else.

32:32.764 --> 32:37.030
I think I can make her if I...
concentrate on it hard enough.

32:42.641 --> 32:45.269
You look really beautiful tonight.

32:45.343 --> 32:47.277
Honey...

32:47.345 --> 32:51.042
you know that my inspirations need to
be my last thoughts before I go to sleep.

32:51.116 --> 32:53.209
This is how I get what I want.

32:59.157 --> 33:01.557
You should really try it sometime.

33:09.601 --> 33:13.367
I think it could really help you, Larry.

33:32.991 --> 33:34.652
Shh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

34:00.518 --> 34:02.452
- Hey. - Mind if I join you?

34:02.520 --> 34:04.454
Sure, come on.

34:05.457 --> 34:07.391
- Want some burrito? - Ah.

34:07.459 --> 34:10.121
- Chef Robert.
- No, thank you. I... I ate something earlier.

34:10.195 --> 34:12.561
- Yeah? What did you have?
- A protein bar.

34:12.630 --> 34:13.960
- A protein bar? - Yeah.

34:14.032 --> 34:15.465
Mmm, tasty.

34:15.533 --> 34:18.024
So I was just looking at the
numbers since the party.

34:18.103 --> 34:19.967
- And you're-you're really improving.
- Great.

34:20.038 --> 34:24.031
I thought maybe we could talk about
ways that you could do even better.

34:24.109 --> 34:26.077
Mmm. Kate, come on.
It's our day off.

34:26.143 --> 34:27.873
I thought maybe we wouldn't talk shop.

34:27.946 --> 34:29.846
But this is really important.

34:29.914 --> 34:32.815
I mean, you're still selling to individuals
and what you want to create...

34:32.884 --> 34:36.284
- is a ripple effect where you
get other people selling for
you. - You should maybe relax.

34:36.353 --> 34:38.288
Is there anything you like to do to relax?

34:38.356 --> 34:41.917
- Like go shopping or watch some football or
get a massage? - There's always people...

34:41.993 --> 34:44.257
- who others look to for advice...
- You like massages, don't you?

34:44.329 --> 34:46.263
Or the inside scoop.

34:46.331 --> 34:49.891
And then they become the connectors
that reach the consumer on your behalf.

34:49.967 --> 34:52.458
Do you know what I mean?

34:52.536 --> 34:54.801
- What?

34:54.873 --> 34:58.365
I just thought we'd have a normal
conversation like normal people today.

34:58.443 --> 35:00.434
I don't know if you understand the pressure.

35:00.512 --> 35:04.004
I mean, you know,
this isn't about me selling my products.

35:04.082 --> 35:07.017
I have to ensure that my
unit is selling their products.

35:07.085 --> 35:09.747
You have a unit?

35:13.391 --> 35:16.918
- That explains why we're in
separate bedrooms perhaps.

35:19.764 --> 35:24.701
You're not a great salesman.
You're a charismatic guy and that's great.

35:24.769 --> 35:28.762
But if you don't apply yourself,
then that's all you're gonna be.

35:28.840 --> 35:32.173
- So this is just business, huh?
- Yeah, this is business.

35:32.243 --> 35:35.144
And I'm your boss. I don't...
I don't need to be friends.

35:35.213 --> 35:37.443
Oh. Okay. Boss.

35:37.515 --> 35:42.680
Ripple effect.
Connectors. Unit. I got it.

35:42.754 --> 35:44.984
- Glad we could talk. - Great.

35:59.737 --> 36:02.934
Yeah, Bill Johnson said you
turned him on to these.

36:03.007 --> 36:05.567
Can't stop talking about how
great the polarized lenses are.

36:05.643 --> 36:07.907
- Yeah, those are sweet.
- I know you'll love 'em.

36:07.979 --> 36:10.504
- Thanks. Put them on my account.
- Great. No problem, gentlemen.

36:12.617 --> 36:14.642
I think I'm gonna get some too.

36:18.590 --> 36:21.423
- Anything I can help you with, Mr. Jones?
- I'd like to book a lesson.

36:21.493 --> 36:23.859
Sure. No problem.

36:23.928 --> 36:27.261
Let's see. I can get you in on
Thursday with Bob Senior.

36:27.332 --> 36:30.495
No, no, no.
I would like to book a lesson with you, Will.

36:30.568 --> 36:32.593
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. You teach, don't you?

36:32.670 --> 36:34.262
Well, yeah, mostly to kids.

36:34.339 --> 36:36.899
I saw you out there the other day.
You got a sweet swing.

36:39.544 --> 36:41.205
- Oh, hey. - Hey.

36:41.279 --> 36:43.213
Sorry.

36:43.281 --> 36:45.340
- How was your day today? - Fine.

36:45.416 --> 36:47.350
- How was yours? - Good.

36:47.418 --> 36:51.184
You know, I wanted to talk to you, uh,
about our conversation.

36:51.256 --> 36:53.850
Oh, forget about it.
Business is business.

37:02.901 --> 37:06.268
Okay, nice.
A little more weight on your back foot there.

37:06.337 --> 37:08.271
- Back foot? - Yeah.

37:10.942 --> 37:13.240
- Nice.

37:13.311 --> 37:18.146
Will, I do believe you just
added 40 yards to my drive.

37:18.216 --> 37:20.411
- You're a magician.
- Let me see that driver.

37:21.920 --> 37:25.378
Will, thanks for pairing me
up with those guys today.

37:25.456 --> 37:28.152
- Hey, no problem, Mr. Jones.
- Who am I playing with tomorrow?

37:28.226 --> 37:31.218
- Don't worry. I got a great threesome
lined up for you. - You the man.

37:31.296 --> 37:35.096
- Cool shirt, by the way.
- Oh, thank you. Under Armour.

37:35.166 --> 37:37.100
If you're looking for drivers,
these are the best.

37:37.168 --> 37:40.626
I was on the course today,
and Mr. Jones drove a 320. It was awesome.

37:44.943 --> 37:48.743
- Whoa, nice shot, Charlie.
- I wish I could take credit.

37:48.813 --> 37:51.304
The kid in the clubhouse turned
me on to those new Mizunos.

37:51.382 --> 37:53.407
That kid's got the scoop on everything.

38:05.363 --> 38:08.924
- Tennis, huh?
- Yeah, doubles with Melanie and the girls.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.492
- Cute outfit.
- Your numbers are looking good.

38:12.570 --> 38:13.764
Thanks, boss.

38:16.774 --> 38:19.334
- Great, Steve. Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

38:19.410 --> 38:21.571
Hand rolled from Cuban seeds.

38:21.646 --> 38:23.637
Hey, you want to join us for drinks later?

38:23.715 --> 38:26.912
Uh, what, are you kidding?
First round's on me, boys.

38:26.985 --> 38:28.976
Nice watch.

38:29.053 --> 38:31.988
Hey, whoever dies with the most toys wins.

38:34.559 --> 38:34.626
No, don't be silly. Let me...
Let me help you with this.

38:34.626 --> 38:39.222
No, don't be silly. Let me...
Let me help you with this.

38:39.297 --> 38:41.424
Well, I'll invite some friends over...

38:41.499 --> 38:44.730
and then you can bring whatever
mask over that you'd like to try.

38:44.802 --> 38:48.704
We're gonna absolutely help you get some
new customers, and we'll have a nice time.

38:48.773 --> 38:52.072
All right, Summer. No problem.

38:52.143 --> 38:54.373
- Yes.

38:54.445 --> 38:56.777
Doesn't it feel wonderful?

38:56.848 --> 38:59.009
It's the Robustion "Replenishingister"Mask...

38:59.083 --> 39:01.745
and it's got ginkgo and wasabi extract.

39:01.819 --> 39:04.982
This house is gorgeous.
Can you get over the furniture?

39:05.056 --> 39:07.923
More champagne, ladies?
- It's all the latest Ethan Allen.

39:07.992 --> 39:09.983
He's got fabulous things.

39:10.061 --> 39:13.861
I know because I was just
at the design center myself
yesterday looking at new things.

39:13.931 --> 39:17.025
Ladies, I just came from the washroom...

39:17.101 --> 39:19.729
and the toilet seat raised
up and waved to me.

39:19.804 --> 39:21.431
Well! - Whoo!

39:21.506 --> 39:23.770
Well, I hope that you introduced yourself.

39:23.841 --> 39:25.570
Huh?

39:25.643 --> 39:29.340
- To Toto, my Tokyo toilet. - Toto?

39:29.414 --> 39:32.076
Well, if that's Toto,
then just call me the Wizard.

39:32.150 --> 39:35.950
'Cause it gave me a power wash to my
undercarriage, and a happy-ending blow-dry.

39:36.020 --> 39:40.218
- Whoo-hoo!

39:40.291 --> 39:43.590
And let me just say,
with a friend like Toto...

39:43.661 --> 39:46.323
that you are never lonely.

39:46.397 --> 39:49.298
Where is that fabulous husband of yours?

39:49.367 --> 39:52.302
Ah, golfing, where else?

39:52.370 --> 39:54.304
- A man's work is never done, huh?
- Never.

39:54.372 --> 39:56.567
Honey, I am home.

39:56.641 --> 39:59.109
- Speak of the devil.
- I missed you today.

40:02.146 --> 40:04.273
Well, hello.

40:06.851 --> 40:09.684
Oh. - Hmm.

40:18.696 --> 40:20.823
Good afternoon, ladies.

40:25.503 --> 40:28.631
My, my.
- That's what I'm talking about.

40:32.610 --> 40:35.101
So, what was that?

40:36.647 --> 40:39.309
Just applying myself.

40:39.383 --> 40:41.544
Don't tell me the ladies weren't impressed.

40:41.619 --> 40:43.553
Wh...

41:28.533 --> 41:31.366
Hey, Jones.
Terry was totally checking you out.

41:31.435 --> 41:33.096
Him? Please.

41:33.171 --> 41:35.264
- What's wrong with him?
- Yeah, he's hot.

41:35.339 --> 41:37.330
- I date men. - Excuse me?

41:41.879 --> 41:44.712
- Who's "the Hammer"? - What?

41:44.782 --> 41:47.273
You guys are gonna have
to go on without me.

41:47.351 --> 41:50.809
- No way. What are you doing?
- I'm gonna go see a friend.

41:51.889 --> 41:53.754
Is he cute?

41:54.826 --> 41:56.987
Don't get kidnapped.

41:57.061 --> 42:00.155

more of those diet pills?

Yep. My brother's really into them.

42:10.842 --> 42:12.776
You'll meet him when he comes home.

42:12.844 --> 42:14.778
Cool.

42:15.847 --> 42:17.781
I gotta go.

42:17.849 --> 42:20.010

lame posers around here.

43:14.639 --> 43:17.199
Well, I mean, there are gonna be
kids from other schools there...

43:17.275 --> 43:19.505

think they'd be interested in?

days are totally wearing upscale brands.

43:31.555 --> 43:34.023
Good luck.

43:40.431 --> 43:43.491
And where are the Joneses
taking the kids for break?

43:43.567 --> 43:46.400
Oh, well, we're so excited.
We're going on safari in Kenya.

43:46.470 --> 43:48.802
Yeah, yeah. It's this amazing outfit.

43:48.873 --> 43:51.364
Spaulding and Kent Tours.
They do everything for you.

43:51.442 --> 43:53.603
They've done all of our family trips.
They're the best.

43:53.678 --> 43:55.612
Really?
- Oh, yes. I mean, every time.

43:55.680 --> 43:57.944
- You should give them the contact.
- Oh, I will.

43:58.015 --> 44:00.176
- I'm going to the ladies' room.
- Okay.

44:00.251 --> 44:04.381
Steve? Steve Cerrilla.

44:04.455 --> 44:07.151
It is you. I couldn't believe it.
I just saw you from over there.

44:07.224 --> 44:09.749
How are you doing?
Where you been, man?

44:09.827 --> 44:12.057
I'm an old friend of Steve's.
My name is Henry.

44:12.129 --> 44:14.029
- Cerrilla?
- Where you been? I'm sorry to interrupt.

44:14.098 --> 44:16.896
Excuse me,
but I-I think you're sitting in my wife's seat.

44:16.968 --> 44:19.937
Wife? This guy was the biggest
stud in Scottsdale, Arizona.

44:20.004 --> 44:23.201
- Excuse me, this is my seat.
- Oh, you're serious?

44:23.274 --> 44:25.435
Oh, my goodness. I-I... This is...

44:25.509 --> 44:27.568
You finally tamed the savage beast, huh?
Unbelievable. Come here.

44:27.645 --> 44:29.579
- I'm sorry. - I am so happy for you.

44:29.647 --> 44:32.514
- You know, I, uh...
- I'm Henry. I'm an old friend of Steve's.

44:32.583 --> 44:35.916
I wish that I knew you, but I think you've
got me mistaken with somebody else.

44:35.987 --> 44:38.512
- I think you've made a mistake.
- I don't think... Are you...

44:38.589 --> 44:40.352
I'm not that guy. - What?

44:40.424 --> 44:42.585
Could you please come with me, sir?
A breath of fresh air.

44:42.660 --> 44:44.594
I don't need air. - Walk this way.

44:44.662 --> 44:46.721
What are you talking about?

44:46.797 --> 44:50.096
I don't get it. That's not cool, dude.

44:50.167 --> 44:52.431
I am terribly, terribly sorry.

44:52.503 --> 44:56.439
- Please enjoy your dinner. - Whoa.

44:56.507 --> 44:58.873
- That was odd. - That was weird.

44:58.943 --> 45:01.878
That is like the third time
since we've been here...

45:01.946 --> 45:04.915
that somebody's mistaken
you for this Steve Cer...

45:04.982 --> 45:07.450
- Has it been three times? - Yes.

45:07.518 --> 45:10.351
- I get mistaken for someone a lot, but...
- Really?

45:10.421 --> 45:13.515
It's usually Tiger Woods. -

45:13.591 --> 45:16.890
Anyway... - Do you have some
kind of secret life going on?

45:16.961 --> 45:19.691
Baby, you bet I do. -

45:19.764 --> 45:23.427
- To secret lives. - To secret lives.

45:23.501 --> 45:25.765
Cheers.

45:36.781 --> 45:40.376
- You look like you could use a drink.
- Thank you.

45:43.054 --> 45:46.785
I think the kids must be working late.

45:48.292 --> 45:52.592
You know, Jenn,
I... I don't know if she's taking my advice...

45:52.663 --> 45:56.599
but I...
I actually think that she's starting to get it.

46:00.971 --> 46:02.905
Oh, you smell great.

46:02.973 --> 46:04.907
It's L 'Artisan.

46:04.975 --> 46:06.636
- Oh, yes. - You like that, baby?

46:08.579 --> 46:12.071
Here you go,
super-stud of Scottsdale.

46:12.149 --> 46:15.641
Well, it's not as big of an
achievement as it sounds.

46:15.719 --> 46:19.246
It was more of a retirement community.

46:24.195 --> 46:26.356
You know the great thing about this job?

46:26.430 --> 46:28.364
What?

46:28.432 --> 46:31.367
You get to be whoever you want to be.

46:31.435 --> 46:36.702
Yeah? But I'm not Steve Jones,
you know.

46:36.774 --> 46:40.608
I'm a single, 45-year-old...

46:40.678 --> 46:43.340
failed golf pro, car salesman...

46:43.414 --> 46:46.247
pretending to be someone I'm not.

46:49.620 --> 46:52.350
I know who you are.

46:58.462 --> 47:00.862
Stop.

47:00.931 --> 47:03.627
- What? - We can't.

47:03.701 --> 47:06.033
Why not?

47:06.103 --> 47:08.628
This part is pretend.

47:09.740 --> 47:12.641
- Is it? - It has to be.

47:18.916 --> 47:20.178
Good night.

47:21.919 --> 47:24.012
Good night.

47:53.617 --> 47:56.051
What? Larry, what?

47:56.120 --> 47:58.111
Hey, hey, Steve.

47:59.290 --> 48:01.224
Look at you. -

48:01.292 --> 48:04.193
- You're kidding. That is awesome.
- I thought I'd go with the red.

48:04.261 --> 48:06.786
Just a little bit hotter than the gray,
what do you think?

48:06.864 --> 48:08.798
I'm jealous. -

48:08.866 --> 48:12.393
You look different. -

48:12.469 --> 48:14.835
- You dog. - Oh, yes.

48:14.905 --> 48:17.396
- Holler at a player, yo.
- Steady stream of gifts.

48:17.474 --> 48:20.272
- Sweet.
- I'm taking care of the luxuries.

48:20.344 --> 48:24.110
- Okay, that's great.
- I got something for you too.

48:24.181 --> 48:27.173
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's top of the line. Laser guide.

48:27.251 --> 48:29.742
No, I can't... I can't take that.

48:29.820 --> 48:34.154
No, seriously, Steve. I insist. I really
want to thank you for helping me out.

48:34.225 --> 48:36.921
What are friends for, right?

48:36.994 --> 48:39.758
- Enjoy it. - Well, thank you.

48:39.830 --> 48:42.321
You bet. Take care.

48:42.399 --> 48:45.891
- Say hi to that wife of yours.
- All right.

48:47.705 --> 48:50.697
Do you mind just looking into the
camera and stating your name?

48:50.774 --> 48:52.969
Steve Cerrilla.

48:53.043 --> 48:56.103
So let me ask you.
Tell me about yourself.

48:56.180 --> 48:59.445
I... You really came very, uh,
highly recommended...

48:59.516 --> 49:02.952
- and your resume is very impressive.
- Thank you.

49:03.020 --> 49:05.181
So you would be the...

49:05.256 --> 49:09.090
the one who was, uh,
playing the role with me.

49:09.159 --> 49:12.094
Um, yes, I would.

49:12.162 --> 49:14.494
Have you ever worked for a woman?

49:14.565 --> 49:17.625
Well, it's something I've
thought about a lot recently.

49:17.701 --> 49:20.636
Because I have never been married...
- I saw that.

49:20.704 --> 49:24.196
Either real or imaginary.

49:24.275 --> 49:26.971
In all seriousness, I've-I've thought...

49:28.345 --> 49:31.508
what it might be like to meet a woman...

49:31.582 --> 49:34.608
who I would be a better person for.

49:34.685 --> 49:36.744
That just hasn't happened, so...

50:02.379 --> 50:04.210
Hey, you know, I got an idea.

50:06.483 --> 50:08.644
Why don't we see a movie today?

50:08.719 --> 50:11.381
I don't get it.
What would we sell there?

50:11.455 --> 50:13.252
Nothing, it's just, you know, for fun.

50:13.324 --> 50:16.054
- Movie. Fun. - Oh.

50:17.961 --> 50:21.488
- Yeah, well, I'm busy. - Sorry, dude.

50:23.334 --> 50:25.268
It's their day off.

50:27.971 --> 50:30.303
- Can I ask you a question? - Sure.

50:33.077 --> 50:35.011
What were your other 12 husbands like?

50:35.079 --> 50:37.673
There weren't 12.

50:37.748 --> 50:39.773
Okay, 10. Whatever.

50:39.850 --> 50:41.750
Please, there were six.

50:41.819 --> 50:45.380
Six? Okay, Henry Vill.
What were they like?

50:45.456 --> 50:48.050
- I don't know. - You don't know?
You spend a year with a guy...

50:48.125 --> 50:50.753
pretending to be husband and wife
and you don't get to know him at all?

50:50.828 --> 50:53.763
Well, you know, you've seen one Mr. Jones,
you've seen 'em all.

50:56.133 --> 50:58.863
- All right. - You can laugh.

50:58.936 --> 51:03.600
All right, well, I'm gonna... take my
coffee down to the basement, all right?

51:03.674 --> 51:06.302
See you later.

51:06.377 --> 51:09.813
Bye. Have a nice day off, okay? -

51:13.617 --> 51:16.950
Merry Christmas, everybody.
- Merry Christmas.

51:17.020 --> 51:21.787
As you can see, these are the products
our clients are pushing for the holidays.

51:21.859 --> 51:24.453
And it's up to you to make sure...

51:24.528 --> 51:28.726
they're under every tree in town... Nice.

51:28.799 --> 51:32.326
Well, I can't,
uh... I can't say that I'm hating this.

51:32.403 --> 51:35.497
- I'm glad that you like it.
- You have excellent taste.

51:35.572 --> 51:37.506
- Thank you. - Is this for me?

51:37.574 --> 51:40.475
- No.
They're for your girlfriend, Naoml.

51:40.544 --> 51:43.513
She'll be selling to her little counter-culture
friends without even knowing it.

51:43.580 --> 51:45.980
If she's gonna be with you,
she's gonna need some style.

51:46.049 --> 51:48.483
- Do I look like Elton John? - Jenn.

51:48.552 --> 51:53.387
Kate tells me you don't have a boyfriend
yet, which is unusual for you, no?

51:53.457 --> 51:56.824
- It would be nice if you could have...

51:56.894 --> 51:58.953
a romantic interest by Christmas, huh?

51:59.029 --> 52:01.122
Working on it.

52:01.198 --> 52:03.860
This has been in the stores 10 days.

52:03.934 --> 52:09.099
"Rudy's Rum Punch."Mmm,
17 % alcohol. Ow!

52:10.541 --> 52:13.305
Not for you.

52:13.377 --> 52:17.541
- A bit lowbrow, don't you think?
- It's up to you to change that.

52:17.614 --> 52:21.641
Uh, there's one other thing I almost forgot.
Steve, wanna come outside?

52:22.786 --> 52:24.777
Enjoy.

52:28.058 --> 52:32.119
The all new Audi R8. - Yeah?

52:32.196 --> 52:36.064
It's for you.
I thought you deserve a little bonus.

52:36.133 --> 52:39.830
Your numbers have shown
tremendous improvement.

52:39.903 --> 52:43.236
Keep it up and this cell
could make icon status.

52:43.307 --> 52:45.537
Go on. I'll bet you look great in it.

52:57.287 --> 52:59.517
Whoo.

52:59.590 --> 53:01.751
Hey, Mick. Check it out.

53:02.993 --> 53:05.484
- Get in.

53:10.234 --> 53:12.532
Is something bothering you?

53:13.871 --> 53:16.396
- I don't know. - You know, if, uh...

53:16.473 --> 53:19.408
if you want to talk about something...

53:19.476 --> 53:23.344
anything, you know,
you can always just...

53:23.413 --> 53:25.813
you know,
talk to your fake mother...

53:25.883 --> 53:27.407
or you can talk to me.

53:29.052 --> 53:31.043
This whole act,
it just... it gets to me.

53:31.121 --> 53:34.522
Who's acting? I love this car. -

53:37.528 --> 53:40.520
That's not what I meant.

53:40.597 --> 53:42.963
Just think of it this way.
We're making a match...

53:43.033 --> 53:44.967
between great products and
the people that want them.

53:45.035 --> 53:46.969
- It's a service.

53:48.205 --> 53:50.139
Hey, Larry.

53:52.209 --> 53:54.643
♪ We at it again Everybody

I think you just ruined his day.

54:13.664 --> 54:16.064
Oh, sweet.

54:16.133 --> 54:18.101
- Sweet, indeed.

54:18.168 --> 54:20.898
I just wanted to remind you that we
have dinner reservations at 8:00.

54:20.971 --> 54:23.303
Oh, good. That sounds good.
Want to hit a few?

54:23.373 --> 54:26.137
- Golf? No.
- Yeah, come on. I'll teach you.

54:26.209 --> 54:28.939
That's what I did before the job
at the dealership... I taught golf.

54:29.012 --> 54:30.946
Hang on to that.

54:31.014 --> 54:33.812
You're gonna hit some golf balls.
Have you ever done it before?

54:33.884 --> 54:35.818
- No. Uh... - Okay. Perfect.

54:35.886 --> 54:39.947
Your knees bend in a little bit.
Weight on the inside of your feet.

54:40.023 --> 54:42.082
- Straight back with the butt out a little bit.
- Butt out?

54:42.159 --> 54:44.150
- Very nice. - Okay.

54:44.227 --> 54:46.991
- Well, the hair. I'm just... Okay, go ahead.
- I-I got it.

54:47.064 --> 54:48.998
Go.

54:52.869 --> 54:54.803
What does icon mean? Oh! Whoa! -

54:56.607 --> 54:59.132
That's a no-no.
I spoke on your backswing.

54:59.209 --> 55:02.201
- Where did you hear that?
- KC said something about it.

55:02.279 --> 55:03.746
Exactly what did she say?

55:03.814 --> 55:06.715
She said something about making
icon status or something like that.

55:07.784 --> 55:09.809
- Do you know what that means?
- No.

55:09.886 --> 55:13.117
It's the top tier of the family cells.

55:13.190 --> 55:16.523
I mean, we'll be bringing
high-end goods to market first.

55:16.593 --> 55:20.188
Lifeimage is gonna be looking for our input...

55:20.263 --> 55:23.357
before proceeding with any products.

55:23.433 --> 55:27.961
You and me. Do you know how long
that I have been working towards this?

55:28.038 --> 55:31.633
- Oh, my God. - Oh, wow. That's...

55:31.708 --> 55:34.176
- Oh. I'm sorry. - That's okay.

55:38.882 --> 55:41.510
Geez. I should say "icon" more often.

55:42.686 --> 55:44.916
I love boats. I just wanna...

55:44.988 --> 55:48.355
go away with you forever.

55:48.425 --> 55:50.791
We could sail the Mediterranean.

55:53.730 --> 55:56.221
- You wouldn't believe how beautiful it is.
- Mmm.

55:57.467 --> 55:59.526
I can imagine.

56:05.509 --> 56:07.909
Where are the Bayners?

56:07.978 --> 56:10.538
Are they... habitually late?

56:11.848 --> 56:13.782
I have a confession to make.

56:13.850 --> 56:15.579
Um...

56:15.652 --> 56:17.984
I don't think they're gonna make it tonight.

56:18.055 --> 56:20.250
Alex is actually working late and...

56:20.323 --> 56:22.416
- Really? - Yeah.

56:22.492 --> 56:24.756
- So it's just me and you? - Yep.

56:25.762 --> 56:29.061
I mean, I was thinking that, uh...

56:30.333 --> 56:33.564
I really wanted to treat you
and just say thank you...

56:33.637 --> 56:37.801
for all your hard work and
your improvement and...

56:37.874 --> 56:39.899
- But I am okay if you want to...
- No, no.

56:39.976 --> 56:43.605
I will suffer through it.

56:43.680 --> 56:45.580
I appreciate that.

56:45.649 --> 56:48.880
Is-Is this technically a date?

56:48.952 --> 56:53.082
Well, you could say that. I mean,
we are out in public, and people can see us.

56:53.156 --> 56:55.886
So would it be inappropriate
if I were to reach over...

56:56.993 --> 57:00.588
and tuck your hair behind your ear like that?

57:00.664 --> 57:03.428
Would that be something that was
acceptable on a night like this?

57:03.500 --> 57:06.435
I suppose that would be okay.

57:06.503 --> 57:08.562
And what about if I told you...

57:08.638 --> 57:10.230
that you look beautiful this evening?

57:10.307 --> 57:11.501
Would that be...

57:11.575 --> 57:13.440
- I-I... - Would that be...

57:13.510 --> 57:15.910
No. I-I would be, um...

57:17.013 --> 57:18.674
I'd be okay with that tonight.

57:18.749 --> 57:19.841
Okay.

57:19.916 --> 57:22.646
And I might even...

57:22.719 --> 57:25.517
go so far as to tell you that...

57:26.690 --> 57:30.319
when you want to,
you can be quite handsome...

57:30.393 --> 57:33.294
and extremely charming.

57:34.564 --> 57:38.295
- Well, I want to. - Okay.

57:46.710 --> 57:48.678
Something to drink!

57:51.815 --> 57:54.045
- Nice. Hey, hey! - Hey!

57:54.117 --> 57:56.051
- Another round? - Another round.

57:56.119 --> 57:58.383
Oh, my goodness.
We are out of control.

57:58.455 --> 58:00.389
This shit is good.

58:00.457 --> 58:02.357
- It's delicious. - I told you.

58:02.425 --> 58:04.825
I gotta pee.

58:04.895 --> 58:07.489
- You go pee. You'll be all right.
- Okay, I'll be back.

58:07.564 --> 58:09.998
We'll save your place.
We'll save your spot.

58:10.066 --> 58:12.694
- Hey, you want one?
- No, I'm good, man. I don't drink.

58:12.769 --> 58:15.067
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks though.

58:15.138 --> 58:18.073
Hey, is that...
is that your TT outside?

58:18.141 --> 58:21.633
It is.
- Man, I gotta check that thing out, dude.

58:21.711 --> 58:24.077
- Let's go. - Let's go.

58:24.147 --> 58:26.081
- Open her up. Let's go.

58:26.149 --> 58:28.276
Go, go, go! -

58:28.351 --> 58:29.375
Whoo!

58:31.688 --> 58:34.521
Are you serious?

58:45.735 --> 58:48.169
You ever get tired of the imaginary stuff?

58:48.238 --> 58:50.672
You want a real...

58:50.740 --> 58:54.733
- house and kids and... husband?
- I'll have that someday.

58:54.811 --> 58:56.438
- Yeah? - Sure.

58:56.513 --> 58:58.413
- When?
- Well, I think when I'm... when I'm ready.

58:58.481 --> 59:02.508
As a matter of fact,
I actually think that I am a lot like you.

59:03.687 --> 59:05.348
How's that?

59:05.422 --> 59:08.914
I think there's a life I was
living that I didn't want.

59:08.992 --> 59:12.621
And until I can figure out
exactly what I want...

59:12.696 --> 59:16.894
I think this substitute life is, um,
is not so bad.

59:16.967 --> 59:19.435
I get it.

59:21.805 --> 59:23.534
To icon.

59:23.607 --> 59:25.404
To icon.

59:26.576 --> 59:28.043
Icon.

59:29.212 --> 59:33.376
I just like saying it. Icon. Icon.

59:33.450 --> 59:36.078
Icon, icon, icon.

59:37.754 --> 59:40.245
Does it have an effect on you in any way?

59:44.561 --> 59:47.962
Yeah! Whoo! That's it. Open it up.

59:50.300 --> 59:51.961
Here we go.

59:52.035 --> 59:54.333
What'd I tell you...
This thing's awesome!

59:55.839 --> 59:57.739
Go, go, go. Make this light.
Make this light.

01:00:11.588 --> 01:00:14.580
- My baby.
- I could get used to this, man.

01:00:14.658 --> 01:00:16.853
- Absolutely. - Appreciate it.

01:00:16.927 --> 01:00:19.794
- Yeah, no problem.
- That was great. You're pretty cool, Mick.

01:00:19.863 --> 01:00:21.854
- Thanks. - Yeah.

01:00:21.932 --> 01:00:24.958
So, uh, anyone home?

01:00:25.035 --> 01:00:28.994
- No, my parents are out of town.
- Yeah.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.571
What a night, man.

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:35.608
- What the hell, man?
- I'm sorry. I just thought...

01:00:35.679 --> 01:00:38.443
Get the fuck away from me!
You son of a fucking bitch!

01:00:38.515 --> 01:00:40.005
- Bitch. - Fuck!

01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:42.017
- Listen, man. I didn't... - Fuck you!

01:00:42.085 --> 01:00:44.212
Shut the fuck up, you faggot!

01:00:44.287 --> 01:00:45.777
I thought you were down for it.

01:00:46.856 --> 01:00:49.051
Fucking...

01:01:03.907 --> 01:01:05.568
Maybe we should stay in tonight.

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:08.372
This doesn't make sense.

01:01:08.445 --> 01:01:10.879
It just keeps saying that all
of our cards are unbalanced.

01:01:10.947 --> 01:01:12.505
You did make the payments,
didn't you?

01:01:12.582 --> 01:01:14.846
I'm sure it's just a mistake.
I'll straighten it out.

01:01:14.918 --> 01:01:17.409
These cards are my foundation, Larry.
I need them for the gala.

01:01:17.487 --> 01:01:19.819
I've got stuff to pay for.
How am I supposed to do that?

01:01:19.889 --> 01:01:22.551
- The linens, the bartenders, the gazebo.
- All right. I'll take care of it.

01:01:22.625 --> 01:01:25.389
- Don't worry. Don't worry.
- Don't worry?

01:01:25.462 --> 01:01:28.431
Larry, you did not make the
house payment last month.

01:01:28.498 --> 01:01:30.762
Why would you tell me
that I don't need to worry?

01:01:32.769 --> 01:01:35.329
Seriously, you gotta fix this today.

01:01:35.405 --> 01:01:37.430
Do you understand me?

01:02:04.034 --> 01:02:07.197
- Mr. Jones? - Yes.

01:02:08.304 --> 01:02:10.636
I'm Detective Gardner,
Third Precinct.

01:02:10.707 --> 01:02:13.642
- I'd like to have a word with you.
- Oh. Well, okay.

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:16.440
It seems like there was a
party near here last night...

01:02:16.513 --> 01:02:19.778
where some alcohol was
being served to minors.

01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:23.751
Now, some of the kids said that
your son Mick brought the alcohol.

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:25.754
Oh, no, no.
That's... That's impossible.

01:02:25.822 --> 01:02:27.949
Is everything all right?

01:02:28.024 --> 01:02:31.482
You know a young lady by
the name of Naomi Madsen?

01:02:31.561 --> 01:02:33.961
Yeah, she's a friend of our son's.

01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:36.464
She left the party drunk
and got in a car accident.

01:02:36.533 --> 01:02:38.626
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit. Is she okay?

01:02:38.701 --> 01:02:41.295
She'll be all right.
Could have been worse.

01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:44.807
Right now, I'm concerned about
where that alcohol came from.

01:02:44.874 --> 01:02:46.307
Is your son home?

01:02:46.376 --> 01:02:49.004
Uh, no.
He left about half an hour ago.

01:02:49.079 --> 01:02:51.775
But I-I could try him on his cell.

01:02:51.848 --> 01:02:54.510
Please. - Thank you, honey.

01:02:57.153 --> 01:02:59.087
Is that a cop?

01:02:59.155 --> 01:03:01.089
Yes, it is.

01:03:01.157 --> 01:03:03.648
- What happened to your face?
- It's nothing.

01:03:03.726 --> 01:03:07.162
- What's going on out there?
- We're trying to save your ass.

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:09.596
So why don't you just get
upstairs and stay out of sight?

01:03:09.666 --> 01:03:11.190
What?

01:03:13.736 --> 01:03:15.670
From father to father...

01:03:15.738 --> 01:03:18.104
I trust you're gonna deal with
your son appropriately, right?

01:03:18.174 --> 01:03:20.938
Ooh, I'm gonna deal with him appropriately.
- Okay.

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:23.570
I just got his voice mail.

01:03:23.646 --> 01:03:27.776
But, um, he's very good about checking in,
so I'm sure we'll hear from him.

01:03:27.851 --> 01:03:30.115
Just to let you know,
these cases often result...

01:03:30.186 --> 01:03:32.882
in some sort of civil liability.

01:03:32.956 --> 01:03:35.424
- You may want to be prepared.
- Thank you for the tip.

01:03:35.492 --> 01:03:36.516
- Yeah. - Sir.

01:03:36.593 --> 01:03:38.424
- Appreciate that.
- Yeah. Nice meeting you.

01:03:38.495 --> 01:03:40.326
Detective. Thank you.

01:03:47.537 --> 01:03:50.529
What are we supposed to do now? Has
anything like this ever happened before?

01:03:50.607 --> 01:03:52.575
So what's going on?

01:03:52.642 --> 01:03:54.974
Naomi Madsen's in the hospital.

01:03:55.044 --> 01:03:57.569
- She got drunk and got into an accident.
- Is she okay?

01:03:57.647 --> 01:03:59.740
It sounds like she's gonna be okay.

01:03:59.816 --> 01:04:02.580
- I want all of that punch out of here
immediately. - Don't worry. It's gone.

01:04:02.652 --> 01:04:04.313
I can't believe you gave it to minors.

01:04:04.387 --> 01:04:08.847
- It's my job. Who do you think drinks
that stuff? - That's not the point.

01:04:08.925 --> 01:04:10.654
Weren't you with her at the party?

01:04:10.727 --> 01:04:14.322
You must have seen she couldn't drive.
Why didn't you take her home?

01:04:14.397 --> 01:04:17.025
- I didn't know she was that drunk.
- Some friend you are.

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:18.658
Shut up, Jenn. I wasn't even there.

01:04:18.735 --> 01:04:21.329
- Then where were you?
- I took a ride.

01:04:21.404 --> 01:04:23.235
Oh, so you were driving drunk as well.

01:04:23.306 --> 01:04:24.898
- No. Tim drove. - Who's Tim?

01:04:24.974 --> 01:04:28.501
- Tim. - Isn't that Naomi's brother?

01:04:28.578 --> 01:04:30.910
So you both left her?
Why would you do something like that?

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:33.039
No, no, no.

01:04:33.116 --> 01:04:34.674
I got it.

01:04:34.751 --> 01:04:37.515
- You were hitting on the wrong guy...
- Fuck you!

01:04:37.587 --> 01:04:39.782
Oh, my God. I knew it.

01:04:39.856 --> 01:04:41.949
- Thank you for that.

01:04:43.626 --> 01:04:46.857
You know what? Screw it.
I shouldn't have to hide this shit anymore.

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:48.591
I'm gay. -

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.400
At least I'm not a slut.

01:04:53.636 --> 01:04:56.628
So-So, what? -

01:04:56.706 --> 01:04:58.731
I'm sorry to spoil the
coming-out party here, guys.

01:04:58.808 --> 01:05:01.436
- I've got someplace to be.
- Where are you going?

01:05:01.511 --> 01:05:04.002
No, no, no.
We all need to get on the same page here.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.878
I don't care what page you guys are on.

01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:08.542
I'm gonna go see my boyfriend.

01:05:08.618 --> 01:05:10.483
And while we're all sharing here...

01:05:10.553 --> 01:05:12.384
it's Alex Bayner.

01:05:12.455 --> 01:05:15.891
- Melanie's husband? - Yeah.

01:05:17.961 --> 01:05:19.656
- Alex Bayner.
- This family's fucked up.

01:05:19.729 --> 01:05:22.823
- Where did we go wrong?
- We're finished.

01:05:22.899 --> 01:05:25.333
It's gonna get around
that Jenn's out of control.

01:05:25.401 --> 01:05:27.892
- We've got the police asking about Mick.
- But there's...

01:05:27.971 --> 01:05:29.598
The company doesn't
tolerate this kind of thing.

01:05:29.672 --> 01:05:32.106
- Hey, come on.
- And I am responsible for this unit.

01:05:32.175 --> 01:05:33.733
No, we will figure this out together.

01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:36.506
There is no "we," Steve.

01:05:41.084 --> 01:05:43.450
I have to go now and file a report.

01:05:47.023 --> 01:05:48.957
Me.

01:05:49.025 --> 01:05:51.493
- It's natural that a family has problems.
- We're not a family.

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:56.221
A unit?

01:06:25.161 --> 01:06:27.095
Knock, knock.

01:06:29.132 --> 01:06:30.997
Hey, sexy.

01:06:31.067 --> 01:06:34.332
You hiding from me down there?

01:06:34.404 --> 01:06:36.395
I'm waiting.

01:06:39.142 --> 01:06:40.632
Looking for someone?

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:43.406
What are you doing here?

01:06:43.479 --> 01:06:45.379
It is my boat.

01:06:52.722 --> 01:06:55.316
He doesn't love you. - Oh.

01:06:55.391 --> 01:06:59.225
Well, aren't you something?
You poor girl.

01:06:59.295 --> 01:07:02.059
You actually think you're special.

01:07:02.131 --> 01:07:04.998
He's met dozens of girls like you.

01:07:05.068 --> 01:07:06.831
You're a plaything.

01:07:06.903 --> 01:07:10.498
He's had his fun, and now it's over.

01:07:10.573 --> 01:07:12.541
Please.

01:07:12.608 --> 01:07:14.667
Stay away from my husband.

01:07:14.744 --> 01:07:17.406
He doesn't want anything to do with you.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.040
You wish.

01:07:38.935 --> 01:07:40.926

KC. That's a surprise.

01:11:48.784 --> 01:11:50.911
Kate didn't mention you coming by today.

Your numbers have gone through the roof.

We're aware of some of
the issues in this cell...

01:12:09.238 --> 01:12:12.036
and we think you could do
better in a different cell...

01:12:12.108 --> 01:12:14.042
an icon cell.

01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:17.910
Well, uh, look,
I appreciate the offer...

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:20.244
but I think this family can
make icon status together.

01:12:20.316 --> 01:12:21.578
They're holding you back.

01:12:21.651 --> 01:12:24.381

01:12:26.255 --> 01:12:29.224
It's her job to make you like her.

01:12:29.291 --> 01:12:33.091
She's a businesswoman,
and she's ambitious.

01:12:33.162 --> 01:12:35.494
Don't think for a minute...

01:12:35.564 --> 01:12:40.467
she wouldn't leap at this
opportunity and leave you.

01:12:40.536 --> 01:12:44.438
What do you think happened
to the last husband...

01:12:44.507 --> 01:12:48.068

01:12:52.782 --> 01:12:54.477
I appreciate it. I do.

good team around me...

- "Zero payments for six months."
- No, that's not it.

Help yourself to some more wine.

01:26:08.610 --> 01:26:10.373
Kate. -

01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:14.972
Is... Is everything okay
in there, sweetheart?

01:26:16.785 --> 01:26:19.049
What are you doing here?

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.350
Well, I wanted to see you.

01:26:21.423 --> 01:26:23.721
Sorry.

01:26:26.161 --> 01:26:28.561
Kate? You all right?

01:26:31.066 --> 01:26:32.897
I've got, uh, guests here.

01:26:32.968 --> 01:26:35.493
We belong together.

01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:38.596
You should have thought of that
before you opened your mouth.

01:26:38.673 --> 01:26:42.939
That's why I opened my mouth.
- Honey...

01:26:43.011 --> 01:26:44.945
Well, uh, who's this?

01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:50.345
It's, uh, a friend.

01:26:50.418 --> 01:26:53.410
Oh. Well, hey, I'm Bob, Bob Jones.

01:26:53.488 --> 01:26:56.321
Drop the act, Bob.
I'm her last husband.

01:26:56.391 --> 01:26:59.758
- What? What's going on? - Nothing.

01:26:59.828 --> 01:27:02.490
- Am I getting fired?
- You don't have to do this anymore.

01:27:02.564 --> 01:27:05.965
- But my numbers are good.
- I think you should leave.

01:27:06.034 --> 01:27:07.160
Right now? No.

01:27:07.235 --> 01:27:08.600
- Bob. - Yes?

01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:10.638
Just calm down and go back to our guests.

01:27:12.007 --> 01:27:14.100
- Go on, Bob. - Go!

01:27:14.175 --> 01:27:16.837
Um... - Everything's fine.

01:27:16.912 --> 01:27:18.709
- You certain? - Yeah. Wine.

01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:20.509
Oh, sure.

01:27:21.716 --> 01:27:23.650
I'm sorry. You were saying?

01:27:23.718 --> 01:27:27.711
I want you to come join
me in the real world.

01:27:30.292 --> 01:27:32.817
This is my real world.

01:27:32.894 --> 01:27:36.330
What are you gonna do when you're too
old to be a mother to these teenagers?

01:27:36.398 --> 01:27:39.629
Are they gonna find a
grandparent cell for you?

01:27:39.701 --> 01:27:42.602
What kind of life is that?

01:27:42.671 --> 01:27:44.764
What kind of joy are you gonna have?

01:27:44.839 --> 01:27:47.774
Whose photos are you
gonna hang on your wall?

01:27:47.842 --> 01:27:50.003
Who's gonna be there at the end for you?

01:27:51.279 --> 01:27:53.213
We had something, Kate.

01:27:55.450 --> 01:27:57.247
It was just a beginning, but it...

01:27:57.319 --> 01:27:59.310
It was real.

01:28:00.989 --> 01:28:03.457
I felt that.

01:28:03.525 --> 01:28:05.652
I'm hoping you felt it too.

01:28:05.727 --> 01:28:08.423
I think you did.

01:28:08.496 --> 01:28:11.624
You deserve to be happy, Kate.

01:28:11.700 --> 01:28:13.691
You deserve to be loved.

01:28:33.922 --> 01:28:35.913
I'm sorry.

01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:58.242
Hey, Steve.

01:28:58.313 --> 01:29:00.747
- Hold up. - Hey, Mick.

01:29:00.815 --> 01:29:03.477
Hey.

01:29:03.551 --> 01:29:05.849
How are things?

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.184
Things are good. Yeah.

01:29:08.256 --> 01:29:10.554
I get to be a college student now. -

01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:12.957
Yeah. And I'm out, which...

01:29:13.028 --> 01:29:15.087
Well, it makes life a lot easier.

01:29:15.163 --> 01:29:17.529
- That's great. - Yeah.

01:29:17.599 --> 01:29:19.658
I don't have to lie anymore.

01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:24.061
I'm happy for you.

01:29:24.139 --> 01:29:27.336
Thanks, Steve. It's been real.

01:29:35.684 --> 01:29:39.518
Hey, uh,
they've been looking for that.

01:29:41.356 --> 01:29:42.687
Ah.

01:29:42.757 --> 01:29:45.021
I'm gonna miss that car.

01:30:23.431 --> 01:30:25.422
He came back for you.

01:31:39.374 --> 01:31:42.605
Where to? - Arizona.

01:31:42.677 --> 01:31:44.736

01:31:44.813 --> 01:31:48.078
