9
How do I explain?
10
What if I told you that Demons were real?
That they were among us?
11
Some are...
12
ethereal monsters that feed off our souls
and push us to do evil.
13
Others are beasts from Hell
that could slice you in half
14
with a single swipe of their claw.

your head and say you understand,
16

21
You would think that either
I was a madman or a prophet.
22
And these days,
it's very hard to believe in prophets.
