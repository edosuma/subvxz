WEBVTT

00:00.304 --> 00:02.219
DENNIS: Can everyone
please gather around

00:02.263 --> 00:04.352
for me because I'd like
to discuss something very,

00:04.395 --> 00:06.136
very important. So, everyone,
if you could just go ahead

00:06.180 --> 00:08.008
and gather, please.
Gather for me.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.184
-Please.
-We're gathered.

00:10.227 --> 00:12.316
Okay, so,
now that you've gathered,

00:12.360 --> 00:14.188
I know that a lot
has been on your minds

00:14.231 --> 00:16.103
these last couple weeks
since I've been back.

00:16.146 --> 00:19.584
Burning questions
about my personal life, yeah.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.195
I was gone. Now I'm back.

00:21.238 --> 00:23.284
That's been confusing for you.
It's been overwhelming.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.329
The whole thing
has been overwhelming for you.

00:25.373 --> 00:28.289
And you've danced around
the topic for a while now

00:28.332 --> 00:29.638
out of respect for my privacy.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.292
And I-I really do
appreciate that,

00:31.335 --> 00:33.120
but I would like for you all
to know that I am ready now,

00:33.163 --> 00:35.122
and I think it's time
to open it up to questions.

00:38.342 --> 00:41.215
Now, don't hold back, guys.
You can ask me anything.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.217
Really. All those questions
that you've got for me

00:43.260 --> 00:46.046
about what's going on,
go ahead and ask them to me now.

00:49.353 --> 00:50.876
You want to ask me

00:50.920 --> 00:52.878
if I'm gonna stay
or if I'm gonna go.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.447
-I don't care. Do you care?
-I mean, it doesn't really...

00:56.491 --> 00:59.276
I may go back. Yeah.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.236
-Okay.
-Hmm.

01:02.279 --> 01:05.152
So, you guys want to ask me
questions about my family.

01:05.195 --> 01:06.457
-I don't.
-Yeah. Hey, listen,

01:06.501 --> 01:08.459
sometimes it's best to raise
a family from a distance.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.679
And that's what
I've decided to do, okay?

01:10.722 --> 01:13.116
And I'm not the first man
in history to ever do it.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.248
-All right, dude.
-Okay.
-Good, good, good.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.901
Okay, so,
if we're gonna sit here,

01:15.945 --> 01:18.339
and you guys are gonna insist
on asking me personal questions,

01:18.382 --> 01:19.949
then be serious.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.385
All right? L-Look, look,

01:21.429 --> 01:23.692
so, if all of you are done
with your stupid questions,

01:23.735 --> 01:25.607
okay, then I have
a question to ask.

01:25.650 --> 01:28.131
I want to know, where is it?

01:28.175 --> 01:30.133
-Where's what?
-Where's what? Where's what?

01:30.177 --> 01:31.482
Where's my car, man?

01:31.526 --> 01:33.397
Where's my Range Rover?

01:33.441 --> 01:35.704
I'm sure you guys, like,
stashed it somewhere safely,

01:35.747 --> 01:37.706
you know, in my absence.
And that's cool. I get it.

01:37.749 --> 01:39.795
But now I want it back,
so where-where is it?

01:39.838 --> 01:41.971
We didn't move you car.
It's right where you left it.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.237
Goddamn it.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.111
â™ª

02:14.264 --> 02:16.962
[sighs] I got to tell you, guys,
that Range Rover,

02:17.006 --> 02:18.790
that was...
that was like a part of me.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.315
You know, I considered it part
of my identity, really.

02:21.358 --> 02:24.187
So it's-it's almost
like a piece of me is gone now.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.276
I mean, you guys
wouldn't really understand

02:26.320 --> 02:27.321
'cause you've never owned
a vehicle.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.236
-We own vehicles.
-Yeah? Name one.

02:29.279 --> 02:32.239
Well, we had those matching
Mongoose bikes back in the day.

02:32.282 --> 02:33.588
Yeah. And I felt
like a piece of me was gone

02:33.631 --> 02:34.980
-when they got stolen.
-Oh, that's right.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.112
-So it's not like
I can't relate.
-Yeah.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.331
Dude, I wonder
if they have bikes around here.

02:37.374 --> 02:38.984
-Something like that.
-They don't have bikes.

02:39.028 --> 02:42.379
-What are...?
-She's a beaut, right?

02:42.423 --> 02:43.467
How can I help?

02:43.511 --> 02:45.252
Yeah, no, she's cool.
She's cool.

02:45.295 --> 02:48.472
Sort of lacks the original's,
uh, masculinity and beefiness,

02:48.516 --> 02:49.778
you know,
but there's a grace to it

02:49.821 --> 02:51.432
that I-I think
I could probably work with.

02:51.475 --> 02:55.436
That being said,
do you guys have any '93 models?

02:55.479 --> 02:58.047
We don't keep anything
before 2015 on the lot.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.570
Oh. Well, that sucks.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.485
Uh, well, I'll take...
I'll take this one, then.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.008
Uh, it's-it's great,

03:03.052 --> 03:04.401
and I'm gonna drive it
straight out of the showroom.

03:04.445 --> 03:05.794
So go ahead and open up
those big doors

03:05.837 --> 03:07.491
or however the hell
you get these cars in there.

03:07.535 --> 03:10.407
-Open those up.
-Well, sir, we need
to talk financing first.

03:10.451 --> 03:12.714
-[groans] Come on.
-Yes, yes. Um, oh, yeah.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.455
Here-Here's my guy here.
You're gonna want to talk to him

03:14.498 --> 03:16.370
-about financing.
-You never bought me
a Range Rover.

03:16.413 --> 03:19.460
All I got were shit cars,
which you guys crashed,

03:19.503 --> 03:20.809
and you certainly
never reimbursed me.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.376
Yeah, yeah,
quit your squawking, Dee.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.247
Hey, uh, Frank, this guy
needs to talk financing.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.596
-This is the one
I'm gonna get here.
-Ooh.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.816
Very nice. Here you go, Dennis.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.034
-[Dee scoffs]
-Yeah, all right.
-That's for you.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.253
-There you go.
-Yeah.

03:30.297 --> 03:33.387
-Uh, what is this, Frank?
-That's $473.

03:33.430 --> 03:36.041
That's the Kelley Blue Book
value of your car.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.478
-Hmm.
-[chuckles]: Okay.

03:37.521 --> 03:38.653
Yeah, that-that's not gonna be

03:38.696 --> 03:40.524
nearly enough to pay-pay
for the down payment

03:40.568 --> 03:42.352
on this, on this car here, so...

03:42.396 --> 03:44.311
-No?
-Uh, is it?
-Uh, no.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.312
Come on, man.
What are you doing here?

03:45.355 --> 03:46.835
Why did you do this?

03:46.878 --> 03:48.837
I came here
to buy myself a Range Rover.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.926
In fact,
that's the one I'd like.

03:50.969 --> 03:52.623
-It's a beauty. Look at that.
-Hmm. Yeah.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.408
And-and I'm gonna pay
full price,

03:54.451 --> 03:56.279
so take it out of there, please.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.541
-Thank you very much. Yeah.
-Fantastic.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.064
That's right. It feels so good.

03:59.108 --> 04:01.415
I haven't bought myself
a new car in ages.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.504
-I just need to see
a driver's license.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:03.547 --> 04:04.722
I got it. Right here.
Absolutely.

04:04.766 --> 04:07.072
There you are. [sighs]

04:07.116 --> 04:09.292
Uh, sir, I'm afraid
I can't sell you

04:09.336 --> 04:11.076
-this vehicle, either.
-Why not?

04:11.120 --> 04:13.775
-Your driver's license
is expired.
-Since when?

04:15.385 --> 04:18.519
SALESMAN:
1984.

04:18.562 --> 04:20.477
-Whoo!
-Yeah, man.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.530
Dork.

04:29.573 --> 04:32.228
[Mac and Charlie laugh]

04:32.272 --> 04:35.231
Jump this manhole.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.885
Nice.

04:36.928 --> 04:39.148
Oh, still got the skid.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.106
-Oh!
-Radical.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.544
Bro, bro, I feel like
a carefree, young kid

04:43.587 --> 04:45.459
on a bike again, man.
World at my fingertips.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.852
-Yeah! Me, too.
-[Charlie whoops]

04:47.896 --> 04:49.114
Why did we stop riding
these things

04:49.158 --> 04:50.638
-in the first place?
-You don't remember?

04:50.681 --> 04:52.466
Dude, Shawn Dumont
and their buddies,

04:52.509 --> 04:53.423
they stole our bikes.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.338
Shawn Dumont. That's right.

04:55.382 --> 04:56.470
-What an asshole.
-Yeah.

04:56.513 --> 04:57.906
Do you remember
what he said to us

04:57.949 --> 04:59.473
when we went back to get them?

04:59.516 --> 05:01.170
"What are you gonna do
about it?"

05:01.213 --> 05:03.564
What are you gonna do about it.
And what can you say to that?

05:03.607 --> 05:04.608
That's, like, the perfect line.

05:04.652 --> 05:05.653
Yeah! Well,
you just got to walk away,

05:05.696 --> 05:06.697
'cause it's the end
of the conversation.

05:06.741 --> 05:07.785
It ends all conversations.

05:07.829 --> 05:08.960
[sighs]
You know, I'm starting

05:09.004 --> 05:10.179
to think that Dennis was right.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.399
It's like what you ride
is your identity.

05:12.442 --> 05:13.617
It-It's like who you are.
It's like, this,

05:13.661 --> 05:14.749
this feels like who I am.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.533
And so Shawn Dumont
didn't just steal our bikes.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.493
-He stole our identity.
-BOY: Cool bikes.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.495
CHARLIE:
Oh.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.584
Hey, thanks, man. Uh...

05:23.627 --> 05:25.150
your bike's really cool, too.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.587
I know it is.

05:26.630 --> 05:29.241
You guys look like you're 40.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.591
-Well, we are 40.
-Do you have

05:30.634 --> 05:33.420
the same bike
as your boyfriend? Gay!

05:33.463 --> 05:35.857
Oh, well, well, I am gay,
but he's not my boyfriend,

05:35.900 --> 05:37.554
-'cause I could do
much better than him.
-CHARLIE: Really?

05:37.598 --> 05:39.643
-Then why don't you, Mac?
-It's difficult out there.

05:39.687 --> 05:40.427
You guys will understand
when you get older.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.385
Oh, don't push
your agenda on them.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.169
I'm not pushing an agenda.
I'm just saying, statistically,

05:44.213 --> 05:45.606
-at least one of them...
-You guys suck.

05:45.649 --> 05:48.739
-Ah, that's...
-That's... Yeah.

05:48.783 --> 05:50.175
Well, look,
we don't mean to bug you.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.438
We'll-we'll be on our way.

05:51.481 --> 05:52.569
Yeah, we don't want any trouble.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.615
-So, uh, Mac, find a hole.
-Oh, okay.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.268
-Go! Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!
-Sorry. Go, go, go.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.183
Go. Go. Go, Charlie, go!

06:01.448 --> 06:04.320
Hey-ho. Look alive.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.539
Snuck up on you there, huh?

06:05.582 --> 06:07.845
Yeah, she's quiet. She's quiet.

06:07.889 --> 06:10.848
But that's a virtue. Stealth.
You know what I mean?

06:10.892 --> 06:13.198
Yeah. You know, personally,
I never saw myself

06:13.242 --> 06:14.809
in an economy car,
but I got to tell you,

06:14.852 --> 06:16.811
it's got its advantages. Yeah.

06:16.854 --> 06:19.553
Yeah, so, I've been gone
for a while.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.206
I'm sure you noticed.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.427
But now I'm back on the scene,
you know? Doing my rounds.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.212
See where the housewives
are posted up. Have a good time.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.997
You know, do me a favor,
keep it out front for me,

06:29.040 --> 06:30.128
because I don't think
I'm gonna-- Oh.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.568
Probably doesn't speak English.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.657
-[horn honks]
-Hey-o.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.049
What up, ding-dong?

06:38.093 --> 06:40.095
Whoa, what is this?
Wh-What am I seeing?

06:40.138 --> 06:42.445
Oh, what, you like my new beast?

06:42.489 --> 06:45.143
-How are you in this car?
-Well, it's Frank's car.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.015
But, uh, until he gets
his license back,

06:47.058 --> 06:48.364
it's mine. I'm gonna drive it.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.018
I just got to drop him off
where he needs to go.

06:50.061 --> 06:51.585
Just dropped him off
at driver's ed.

06:51.628 --> 06:52.847
And I got to tell you, Dennis.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.631
I get why you want
to be a Range Rover man.

06:54.675 --> 06:56.677
You know, it's kind of like
you're up on a throne

06:56.720 --> 06:59.941
a-and you-you're looking down
on all the minions, you know?

06:59.984 --> 07:02.465
-Very powerful. Yeah. Oh.
-Right. Right. Right.

07:02.509 --> 07:04.511
-Thank you. You just,
uh, keep it out front.
-Oh, yeah.

07:04.554 --> 07:05.816
Don't bother.
He doesn't speak English.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.644
Of course, ma'am.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.777
-Thank you.
-No, I mean, he didn't spe--
He doesn't, um...

07:09.820 --> 07:11.822
-Huh?
-I'm-I'm saying he doesn't,
I'm saying he...

07:11.866 --> 07:13.476
-What were you saying?
-He doesn't always
speak English.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.870
Sometimes he's--
I come here a lot, so, yeah.

07:15.913 --> 07:19.526
Uh, anyway, you want to hear
something that's really cool?

07:19.569 --> 07:20.918
-All right.
-I drove all the way here

07:20.962 --> 07:22.703
and barely used
an ounce of gas.

07:22.746 --> 07:26.663
Now, that is both economically
and environmentally responsible.

07:26.707 --> 07:28.273
-So...
-Excuse me.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.711
Is that the 2018?

07:30.754 --> 07:32.582
Oh, it most certainly is.

07:32.626 --> 07:34.192
I was just telling
my friend Brenda here

07:34.236 --> 07:35.498
that she needs to upgrade.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.719
-She is still driving a 2013.
-All right.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.111
Oh. [laughs]

07:40.155 --> 07:41.939
Are you loving it?
I mean, just loving it?

07:41.983 --> 07:44.551
I tell you what, I am loving it.
And, Brenda, you got to upgrade,

07:44.594 --> 07:46.291
you stupid bitch. Okay?
Don't be a dumb idiot.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.554
[laughs]

07:48.598 --> 07:50.295
[both laugh]

07:50.339 --> 07:52.733
-Oh, you are fun.
-Eh.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.299
-Would you like
to join us for lunch?
-Oh, yes.

07:54.343 --> 07:55.518
DENNIS:
Uh, you know, ladies,

07:55.562 --> 07:56.911
you know, while we're
on the subject of cars,

07:56.954 --> 07:58.869
um, I actually drove here
in a Prius today...

07:58.913 --> 08:00.088
Oh, so you don't
have a Range Rover.

08:01.132 --> 08:02.743
Uh, well, no.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.745
-I just said I have a Prius...
-No? Okay.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.355
Then why are we talking to you?
[laughs]

08:06.398 --> 08:08.096
[women laugh]

08:08.139 --> 08:10.185
-Come on.
-[laughing]: Oh, my gosh.

08:18.585 --> 08:19.760
So when you come
to a four-way stop,

08:19.803 --> 08:21.544
who has the right of way?

08:21.588 --> 08:23.546
Okay, what you want to do is,

08:23.590 --> 08:25.330
you want to lurch
into the intersection.

08:25.374 --> 08:26.941
It's like,
kind of like a game of chicken.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.421
You lurch and then you lurch,
you lurch some more,

08:29.465 --> 08:32.381
and whoever doesn't flinch
gets to go first.

08:32.424 --> 08:34.644
Mr. Reynolds, if you would
just look at the book.

08:34.688 --> 08:37.038
Well, e-excuse me,
in all due respect,

08:37.081 --> 08:40.607
but this book does not have the
real rules of the road in here.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.174
There's nothing in this book
about the Asians.

08:43.218 --> 08:44.785
-[students gasp]
-You can't be PC

08:44.828 --> 08:47.570
on the road
and expect to live.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.224
You will die.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.965
You go to a four-way stop,

08:51.008 --> 08:53.707
and you think the rules
of the road are going to apply

08:53.750 --> 08:57.624
to an 80-year-old Asian woman,
you're gonna get blasted.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.800
-[school bell rings]
-Right. Well, we are out of time

08:59.843 --> 09:01.366
for today.
I urge you all

09:01.410 --> 09:04.761
to study what's in the book
and not listen to this man here.

09:05.806 --> 09:08.852
Bruh, that shit was hilarious.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.159
You're gonna fail so hard, man.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.378
I can't afford to fail. I ca...

09:13.422 --> 09:15.772
-You mind if I cheat off you?
-Yeah, maybe.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.382
-Yeah.
-What's in it for me?

09:17.426 --> 09:18.470
I'll buy you a case of beer.

09:18.514 --> 09:19.602
Nah, I never get carded.

09:19.646 --> 09:20.951
Cigs? Weed? Blow?

09:20.995 --> 09:22.736
Nah, I'm in high school, man.
I can get all that shit.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.825
-How about porno? Yeah.
-Porno?

09:24.868 --> 09:25.956
Dude, I've got a phone.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.871
I've been looking at porno
since I was, like, ten.

09:27.915 --> 09:29.220
No, I'm talking
about the real thing.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.179
-The real shit?
-Yeah, the real deal.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.963
-All right.
-Yeah?

09:33.007 --> 09:34.225
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.795
-[car door opens]
-Hey, man.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.623
-Whoa.
-How's it going?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.059
Wha-What are you doing?

09:42.103 --> 09:45.106
Oh. I'm John.
Aren't you my Uber?

09:45.149 --> 09:47.761
Am-am I your Uber?
No, I...

09:47.804 --> 09:50.851
Oh, okay. Okay.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.635
[laughing]: Yeah, I think I see
what's happening here.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.898
Yeah, no, no, I'm-I'm not
your Uber, I'm not your ride.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.421
-[laughs]: Oh, God.
-So, yeah.

09:56.465 --> 09:59.033
Yeah, so why don't you...
um, why don't you get out?

09:59.076 --> 10:01.644
Yeah, sorry, man. [chuckles]
Nice car, by the way.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.864
Yeah, thank you. Thank you.
Yeah, no, it is a...

10:03.907 --> 10:05.866
It is a nice car, isn't it?
Yeah.

10:05.909 --> 10:07.476
Yeah, nothing to be ashamed of.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.130
Not at all.
It's very sensible.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.523
I Uber 'cause I drive
this old piece of shit

10:11.567 --> 10:12.873
that gets no mileage, so...

10:12.916 --> 10:14.875
Ah. Yeah. [chuckles]

10:14.918 --> 10:16.877
-Hey, John, was it?
-Mm-hmm.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.270
That's a strong economy name.

10:19.314 --> 10:21.795
You know, it says so much,
yet it says so little.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.275
-Hmm.
-Yeah, you got a good
economy face on you, too.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.842
-What?
-Eh.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.583
Hey, man, I got to get going.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.237
I have some friends from
my fantasy league coming over,

10:29.280 --> 10:31.543
-so I should find my ride.
-Hey, I like sports, too.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.284
Yeah, I do, but I've never

10:33.328 --> 10:35.722
really engaged
with the fantasy element of it.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.898
-No? Oh, it's the best.
-No.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.030
And daily fantasy
makes every game matter.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.858
-Huh.
-You get way more bang
for your buck.

10:41.902 --> 10:44.252
Ah. Well, that's economical.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.167
I-- You know what?
That makes total sense.

10:46.210 --> 10:49.170
I think I'm, I think
I'm starting to understand now.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.520
It always seemed foolish
to me before,

10:51.563 --> 10:53.087
but this economy car
has got me thinking

10:53.130 --> 10:55.916
I could enjoy
economy activities.

10:55.959 --> 10:58.483
You know what, John.
Cancel your ride.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.485
I'll drive you to your fantasy.

11:00.529 --> 11:01.748
Thanks, man.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.750
-Yeah.
-Huh.

11:03.793 --> 11:07.623
Aw, dude, when was the last time
we bought baseball cards, man?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.494
I don't know,
but it's fun, dude,

11:09.538 --> 11:11.061
and it's also, like,
a great investment, right?

11:11.105 --> 11:12.846
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I got a Chuck Knoblauch!

11:12.889 --> 11:14.717
-That's, like, pre-yips, man.
-Pre-yips?

11:14.761 --> 11:16.414
-Yeah.
-That could be worth a fortune!

11:16.458 --> 11:18.329
Yeah, it's gonna be worth a lot,
man. He was good.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.288
-Goddamn.
-See, this is what I feel like
we missed out on.

11:20.331 --> 11:21.942
Like-like, our whole lives
could've been different

11:21.985 --> 11:23.160
if those bikes weren't stolen,
you know?

11:23.204 --> 11:24.727
Yeah, I know.

11:24.771 --> 11:28.818
Wait. Where's your bike?

11:28.862 --> 11:30.690
Ah, shit.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.259
Yeah, bro,
I don't know if I'm down

11:35.303 --> 11:36.783
for whatever
you got planned out here.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.262
-I mean...
-No, no. Here you go.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.960
-What the hell is...?
-This is, this is it.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.744
This is it. This is it.
This is where I kept it.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.746
Check this out. Huh?

11:43.790 --> 11:46.575
Check this out. TrÃ©sor.

11:46.618 --> 11:47.968
-Check this out. Yeah.
-TrÃ©sor?

11:48.011 --> 11:49.883
Look at this.
Look at that.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.537
Skank.Hold on to that.

11:52.581 --> 11:55.323
-Look at this. Score.
-Okay, but...

11:55.366 --> 11:57.194
-Look at it. This is...
-Brah, I-I thought, I thought

11:57.238 --> 11:58.979
you was gonna get me laid,
all right?

11:59.022 --> 12:00.328
-That would have been lit.
-Huh? Well, this is just...

12:00.371 --> 12:02.112
-This shit's just weird as hell.
-Well, no...

12:02.156 --> 12:03.635
-I mean, the plastic bags?
Come on, man.
-Well, the...

12:03.679 --> 12:06.116
Look, my-my boy Dennis is tight
with the girls.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.337
He's gonna get you laid, but you
got to help me pass that test.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.905
Here, check this out.
Look at that. Ooh!

12:11.948 --> 12:13.471
-Oh, yeah. Hey, hey. No, no.
-Huh? That's nice. Wait.

12:13.515 --> 12:14.995
Hold that up. I want to get it
for my Instagram story.

12:15.038 --> 12:16.997
Yeah, that was good. That was
good. Here you go, here you go.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.043
-Check this out. Ho!
-Oh!

12:20.087 --> 12:21.349
This shit's weird as hell, man.

12:21.392 --> 12:22.785
-[laughs]
-Yeah.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.787
[relaxing music playing]

12:24.831 --> 12:26.615
I mean, sure,
it feels a little fast.

12:26.658 --> 12:29.139
And at first I thought it was
'cause I had the newest model,

12:29.183 --> 12:30.837
but that's not it.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.403
They recognize me
for who I really am.

12:32.447 --> 12:33.927
You know, my true identity.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.016
They, uh, invited me

12:36.059 --> 12:37.408
to Turks and Caicos
for Karen's birthday

12:37.452 --> 12:40.368
on a private jet. [laughs]

12:40.411 --> 12:43.023
That's when I was like,
"Okay, well, which one is it?

12:43.066 --> 12:46.069
Turks or Caicos? 'Cause I'm not
invited back on Caicos."

12:46.113 --> 12:49.029
[laughs]

12:49.072 --> 12:50.770
Why aren't you laughing?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.730
No. Well, you probably
don't speak English.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.427
I speak English.
It's just not funny.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.038
[women laughing]

12:58.081 --> 12:59.604
-Oh, my God.
-Oh.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.476
Deandra, that massage
was everything.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.434
-Was it?
-Ah. We deserve it.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.393
-Mm.
-At least I do.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.961
I just wish my second husband
came with a dimmer switch.

13:08.004 --> 13:09.963
I forgot how much energy
men in their 20s have.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.442
Oh. [chuckles]

13:11.486 --> 13:14.184
Karen upgraded.
Her first husband was, like, 70.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.056
-Mm.
-Now she's got a boy toy

13:16.099 --> 13:17.971
with five percent body fat. Yum.

13:18.014 --> 13:20.060
Karen, you dog.

13:20.103 --> 13:21.844
But his brain is the size
of a pea,

13:21.888 --> 13:23.106
-so conversations are
like pulling teeth.
-Hmm.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.065
You don't have
to worry about these things

13:25.108 --> 13:26.762
-'cause you've never
been married.
-That's true.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.025
The fuck is that supposed
to mean?

13:31.245 --> 13:34.117
Oh, Karen, you bitch.

13:34.161 --> 13:37.642
You dumb idiot.
You stupid savage.

13:37.686 --> 13:41.081
You're not the alpha here,
you crusty-ass fool.

13:41.124 --> 13:44.258
Oh, I'm gonna cuck you so hard.

13:44.301 --> 13:47.348
Your boy toy-- he's mine.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.872
I will destroy you.

13:49.916 --> 13:53.310
I am a 2018 Range Rover woman.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.573
I am a golden goddess.

13:55.617 --> 13:57.575
Who are you, idiot?

13:57.619 --> 13:59.099
Savage!

13:59.142 --> 13:59.882
[echoes]:
Idiot!

14:01.710 --> 14:04.060
Yo, yo, Den dog,
we're here. Hey.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.670
DENNIS:
[chuckles] Hey, Frankie.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.107
-Hey, how you doing?
-What's up? Hey.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.456
-Hey, thanks for inviting us.
-Yeah.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.893
Hey, uh, listen, everybody,
this is my friend Frank

14:10.937 --> 14:12.895
-and his, uh... friend.
His-his, uh...
-Hey.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.723
-...young friend.
-Mm-hmm.

14:14.766 --> 14:15.942
-Thanks for inviting us. Yeah.
-Make yourself at home.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.335
-Hey. Hey.
-Yeah. Hey. Uh,

14:18.379 --> 14:19.902
what do you think, guys?
It's pretty great, right?

14:19.946 --> 14:21.077
John's got a pretty nice setup.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.687
You know,
he's got great Wi-Fi, too,

14:22.731 --> 14:24.298
which is great
for playing fantasy sports.

14:24.341 --> 14:25.908
We're-we're doing a little
fantasy baseball right now.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.344
Is this the dude
you're talking about?

14:27.388 --> 14:29.477
Uh, yeah. Mm, yeah.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.131
Don't embarrass me, man.

14:31.174 --> 14:32.262
-I'm not embarrassing you.
-Dennis.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.350
-This place is weak, bro.
-Oh.

14:33.394 --> 14:34.917
-Bro.
-It's not-- no, not weak.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.050
-[scoffs]
-Who is...? Yeah. Not weak, guy.

14:37.093 --> 14:39.139
I mean, these guys,
they-they totally get it.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.401
You know what I mean? Hey, look.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.185
They work hard,
but they play hard, you know?

14:42.229 --> 14:44.187
They play fantasy hard, too.

14:44.231 --> 14:45.972
-Yeah. I really want
to show you this lineup I...
-[stammers] Dennis?

14:46.015 --> 14:48.148
At least hit on
the one chick that's here.

14:48.191 --> 14:51.020
Oh. Uh, no. That's-that's Tara,
and I think, uh...

14:51.064 --> 14:54.154
I think John's got a little bit
of a thing for her, so...

14:54.197 --> 14:55.329
You lose your mojo?

14:55.372 --> 14:57.113
[scoffs]
I didn't lose my mojo.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.767
-I still got my...
-Yeah, you got it.

14:58.810 --> 15:00.073
-You got the moves?
-I got my mojo.

15:00.116 --> 15:01.726
-I said you-you...
-What are you doing?

15:01.770 --> 15:03.990
-Uh, Insta story.
-Kids.
-Cool.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.513
[groans] What is it?

15:05.556 --> 15:07.167
AIDAN:
It's video, bro.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.951
Uh, okay. What do I do?

15:08.995 --> 15:10.170
Like, should I do,
like, a thing, or...?

15:10.213 --> 15:11.954
AIDAN:
Oh, this dude sucks.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.478
What are you doing, man? I don't
suck. Dude, I'll suck you.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.263
-You'll suck me? [laughs]
-No, that's...

15:16.306 --> 15:17.917
-That's not what I meant.
-Oh, that's perfect, man.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.135
What are you, what are you
gonna do with that, dude?

15:19.179 --> 15:20.267
-Don't put that out
in the world.
-Go, go, go, go.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.921
-Go hit on the girl, will you?
-Yeah.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.748

-I'll hit on Tara, man.
You'll see.
-I want to watch. Let's go.

15:25.185 --> 15:26.577

-Come on.

15:26.621 --> 15:27.839
-Watch this. Watch this.
-All right. All right.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.320
Yo.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.148

-Hey, what's up, man?

15:32.192 --> 15:34.542
Um, oh, cooking. You--
What is that, chili? Cool.

15:34.585 --> 15:37.371
-Yeah.
-Did you make enough
for everybody?

15:37.414 --> 15:39.982
-Yeah, you want some?
-Oh, no. It makes me...
makes me fart.

15:40.026 --> 15:43.377
[chuckles] I don't want to,
I don't want to fart right now.

15:43.420 --> 15:47.207
Um... I noticed
you were wearing a hat,

15:47.250 --> 15:48.599
and that's...
that's pretty cool.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.601
Like, I don't see a lot of,
like, girls wearing hats,

15:50.645 --> 15:52.255
you know, and I'm wearing a hat,
too, you know.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.214
It's like, it's like we're...

15:54.257 --> 15:55.345
It's like we're hat twins.
[laughs]

15:55.389 --> 15:57.608
You know what I mean? Yeah.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.220
And I-I have a twin.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.786
I mean, I am a twin.
Like, I'm part--

16:01.830 --> 16:03.353
I'm one part of a twin. Uh...

16:03.397 --> 16:05.790
I have a twin sister,
is what I'm trying to say.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.270
Mm.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.186
Yeah, she farts a shit ton, man.

16:12.058 --> 16:15.017
Yeah. I-I don't have that.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.237
Like, everything makes her...

16:17.280 --> 16:18.847
everything makes her fart.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.022
-I'm gonna get back in there.
-Yeah.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.589
-Yeah.
-The Minnesota Twins.

16:21.632 --> 16:24.026

We're gonna hit the road. Uh...

16:32.295 --> 16:33.296
-Are you guys gonna take off?
-Yeah, we're gonna

16:33.340 --> 16:34.167

-Be good though, bro.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.864
-Word. Word.
-FRANK: See you, man.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.257
Look, just pedal faster.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.172
I'm going as fast as I can, bro.
You tacked on

16:39.215 --> 16:41.304
-a little too much mass,
I think.
-Don't blame this on me, dude.

16:41.348 --> 16:43.089
-Are you doing the leg routine
I gave you?
-I'm so tired

16:43.132 --> 16:44.481
-of doing your routines, man.
-Are you drinking
the Fight Milk?

16:44.525 --> 16:45.830

-Hey, punks!

16:50.139 --> 16:51.271
That's our bike.

16:51.314 --> 16:52.402
Well, it's ours now.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.274
What are you gonna do about it?

16:54.317 --> 16:56.276
-Listen, you little piece
of shit. I'm gonna...
-Yo, whoa!

16:56.319 --> 16:58.278
Hey! The hell is this?

16:58.321 --> 16:59.627
What are you doing?
You yelling at my kid?

16:59.670 --> 17:01.194
-Uh, thank you
for coming out, sir.
-You all right?

17:01.237 --> 17:03.892
Uh, I believe that your son
and his friends stole a bike.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.894
I'm sorry,
Stephen stole your son's bike?

17:05.937 --> 17:08.070
-Uh, no. He stole our bike.
-Let me talk to my son.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.290
-Let's see if we can get down
to it, okay?
-Okay. Okay. Thank you.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.640
-Dude, do you know who that is?
-No.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.424
That's Shawn Dumont, who stole
our bike in seventh grade.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.122
-That's him.
-That's Shawn Dumont?

17:16.165 --> 17:17.427
-Holy shit, you're right.
-I know.
He got fat as shit, man.

17:17.471 --> 17:18.950
I almost didn't recognize him.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.517
Y-You know what, dude,
I don't even care.

17:20.561 --> 17:22.650
I just want to get my bike
and let's just go

17:22.693 --> 17:24.173
-and have fun.
-Let's just get back to it.
All right.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.306
Let's not get tripped up
by that.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.786
Okay, good news.
He didn't steal it.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.484
-What? Uh, yeah, he did.
It's-it's right there.
-Yeah.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.181
I'm looking at it.
You want to take a look?

17:32.225 --> 17:33.878
No, no.
He says he didn't steal it.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.880
And, you know,
he didn't steal it.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.447
-Okay?
-Well, no,
that is definitely our bike,

17:37.491 --> 17:40.102
-a-and we want it back, okay?
-Yeah, we want it back.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.977
What are you gonna do about it?

17:46.021 --> 17:47.979

-Nothing.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.117
-Yeah. That's what I thought.
-Damn it.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.119
-Dude, it's the perfect line,
dude. There's no coming back...
-Yeah.

17:57.163 --> 17:58.686
-...from that.
-It's just like,
when you say it,

17:58.729 --> 18:00.383
it just ends the whole thing.

18:00.427 --> 18:01.515

Oh, I-I've seen them.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.540
I've seen them real up close

-Dude,

18:53.044 --> 18:54.959
my mom saw the Instagram

18:55.003 --> 18:56.961
She said no phone privileges
and no license.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.311
I'm-I'm grounded, bro.

18:58.354 --> 19:01.183
Aw! Moms are so not lit.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.577
Hey, but, yo,
I did get laid last night.

done this to me?

-Frank?
-Deandra, what the hell

I showed him
how to drive stick last night.

19:25.251 --> 19:27.209
Aidan's my son!

19:27.253 --> 19:28.341

-Are you sure about this?
-Yes, dude.

19:38.307 --> 19:40.004
Shawn Dumont is an asshole.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.789
He stole our bikes
and he stole our identities.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.486
I can't believe he's getting
away with this, man.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.271
