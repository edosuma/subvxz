"Hello.

00:05.640 --> 00:08.250
I wasn't sure how to begin,

00:08.250 --> 00:10.710
but for my first word, a greeting is appropriate.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.660
Hello, world.

00:12.660 --> 00:13.990
Hello, Shiroe.

00:14.990 --> 00:16.910
'Shiroe, of Log Horizon.'

00:17.310 --> 00:20.910
When I heard that name, I felt so strange.

00:21.430 --> 00:25.150
Because your memories are still within me.

00:26.230 --> 00:31.070
Just like you are beings who have 
come to this world from another,

00:31.070 --> 00:35.140
we have done the same, as well.

00:36.030 --> 00:37.760

02:23.340 --> 02:26.280
What should we make today, Nyanta?

02:26.280 --> 02:28.190
Let me see...

02:34.490 --> 02:36.240
Working hard, Shiro?

02:36.630 --> 02:39.130
I know you just got back, 
but can you tell me the details

02:40.180 --> 02:42.140
about this new type of monster?

02:42.220 --> 02:48.140
<b>Stranger</b>

02:45.040 --> 02:46.220
Stranger.

02:48.530 --> 02:50.160
And that's what happened.

02:51.910 --> 02:54.300
The genius of marriage, Camaysar.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.670
That was more like marriage fraud than marriage.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.800
The West Wind girls were the 
ones who first found him?

03:00.070 --> 03:01.110
Yeah.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.150
We have access to the girls' information network,

03:04.150 --> 03:06.180
so we're really good at that.

03:07.140 --> 03:09.360
Yes, it's amazing, my lord.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.860
You also knew about it, Akatsuki?

03:10.860 --> 03:12.090
No, not at all.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.550
So what happened?

03:15.550 --> 03:16.810
Well...

03:17.810 --> 03:19.060
A second form?

03:19.060 --> 03:20.340
We'll attack immediately.

03:20.610 --> 03:23.350
Give them to me, adventurers.

03:23.350 --> 03:24.080
Nazuna!

03:24.080 --> 03:25.010
Right.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.480
My beautiful brides...

03:30.060 --> 03:31.370

03:33.140 --> 03:35.320
You guys are as crazy as ever...

03:35.320 --> 03:38.820
We'll show no mercy to anyone 
who touches our girls.

03:38.820 --> 03:41.310
Yes, we show no mercy, my lord!

03:41.310 --> 03:42.880
Did you also help, Akatsuki?

03:42.880 --> 03:44.230
No, not at all.

03:45.870 --> 03:49.020
So what is he, exactly?

03:49.710 --> 03:50.810
Is he an enemy?

03:51.760 --> 03:53.450
An enemy, huh?

03:54.090 --> 03:57.930
Since they're attacking us, we have to fight.

03:57.930 --> 04:00.630
Then we just need to protect the town, huh?

04:00.630 --> 04:02.090
Leave it to us.

04:02.090 --> 04:03.340
Leave it to me, my lord.

04:03.340 --> 04:05.110
Ah, thanks.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.780
Come to think of it, he was a weird enemy.

04:07.780 --> 04:08.430
Weird?

04:08.910 --> 04:12.690
Since we came to this world, he's the 
enemy most like those in <i>Elder Tale</i>.

04:13.290 --> 04:16.940
Yeah, like it was too easy...

04:14.420 --> 04:16.940
Be my beautiful bride...

04:17.740 --> 04:19.330
It was like a game.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.700
It felt hollow.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.680
Like I was fighting from 
behind a computer screen.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.450
Fried rockfish is the best!

04:28.450 --> 04:31.450
Fried rockfish is the best!

04:32.550 --> 04:34.900
Sir Isaac! Sir Isaac!

04:36.550 --> 04:39.840
How can he jump so high?

04:40.670 --> 04:42.930
Sir Isaac, how can heâ€”

04:42.930 --> 04:44.230
Just call me "Isaac."

04:44.740 --> 04:45.720
But...

04:46.110 --> 04:47.220
You know, uh...

04:47.580 --> 04:48.970
I'm Iselus.

04:49.670 --> 04:53.430
Iselus, can you try to be a little less formal?

04:53.430 --> 04:55.760
You're an adventurer, Sir Isaac.

04:55.760 --> 04:59.570
And you're training the knights of Maihama.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.990
I'm just doing it because I want to.

05:02.240 --> 05:07.660
And I'm told that, in Akihabara, 
you help my sister, Lenessia.

05:08.110 --> 05:11.030
Taking care of her is the elite glasses guy's job.

05:11.030 --> 05:13.480
He's on a trip now, though.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.320
Then is he an adventurer, too, Sir Isaac?

05:17.590 --> 05:18.720
I told you...

05:18.720 --> 05:19.750
Isaac,

05:20.550 --> 05:22.550
should we let them take a break?

05:22.550 --> 05:24.630
And I told you not to be so informal!

05:24.940 --> 05:26.610
See, Sir Iselus.

05:26.610 --> 05:28.400
Just talk to him like I do.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.280
All right, I'll try.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.970
You guys are seriously...

05:32.200 --> 05:34.490
What's wrong, Isaac?

05:34.490 --> 05:37.080
It's kind of cool! Isaac!

05:37.580 --> 05:38.980
He's so cute!

05:39.870 --> 05:44.300
I swear, you guys, I'm going 
to use Sword of Pain Black!

05:45.570 --> 05:48.650
At a glance, he looked like a 
normal Person of the Land.

05:49.090 --> 05:52.370
And he was able to judge the quality of ores.

05:52.370 --> 05:55.950
Ever since the Apocalypse, 
the prices of material items

05:55.950 --> 05:59.490
have depended on their quality.

05:59.490 --> 06:03.130
So lots of adventurers started 
to ask him for appraisals.

06:03.510 --> 06:07.230
But let's say he picked up a rock from the ground

06:07.230 --> 06:10.140
and said it was top-grade ore.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.630
<b>Rock 

Effect: Rock 
Just a rock</b>

06:10.930 --> 06:14.220
For some reason, everyone would believe him

06:14.220 --> 06:17.000
and buy a simple rock for an incredible price.

06:17.710 --> 06:22.420
In other words, he was a monster 
that destroyed things' measures,

06:22.420 --> 06:25.400
their weights, lengths, and values.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.410
The genius of measures, Bagris.

06:29.850 --> 06:33.460
What tipped us off was the "ate a ton 
and still felt hungry" incident.

06:33.930 --> 06:37.370
After an investigation, we found out what he was.

06:37.810 --> 06:39.640
We put together a quick half-raid team

06:39.640 --> 06:41.390
and went to get rid of him, but...

06:42.400 --> 06:46.790
I should be able to gain ample empathions from this.

06:53.380 --> 06:57.140
distance, speed, skill damage, and even targets.

06:57.140 --> 06:58.890
It wasn't even a fight.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.910
Give me your empathions now.

07:03.910 --> 07:07.350
Just when everyone was about to give up...

07:07.350 --> 07:08.890
Sorry to keep you waiting.

07:09.530 --> 07:13.730
With the help of the Kunie Clan, 
I've finished our secret weapon at last!

07:13.730 --> 07:14.910
Oh, you did it?

07:15.330 --> 07:17.140
This is the end, Bagris.

07:17.140 --> 07:19.530
I'll stop your evil deeds.

07:20.000 --> 07:20.920

07:25.970 --> 07:28.280
Is that a ruler?

07:28.280 --> 07:29.570
It's a ruler, yeah.

07:29.570 --> 07:30.430
Definitely a ruler.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.180
It is a Source Vessel.

07:33.180 --> 07:38.430
It is a magical device that measures all 
things, and fixes their dimensions.

07:38.740 --> 07:41.170
We sealed his abilities, and then...

07:41.790 --> 07:43.650
<i>Tiger Echo Fist!</i>

07:47.590 --> 07:49.620
Something like that.

07:49.620 --> 07:50.530
There was one more.

07:51.260 --> 07:52.820
Tell everyone, Seine.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.030
Oh...

07:55.530 --> 07:58.790
I'm Nyanko Tavern's guild master, Seine.

07:59.410 --> 08:01.090
There was another matter

08:01.090 --> 08:03.290
besides the Genius of Scandal 
I told you about last week.

08:03.740 --> 08:06.800
The poisoning incident before the Scale Festival.

<b>Genius of Plague

08:09.790 --> 08:11.790

At the time, we decided she 
might be a new monster

08:16.600 --> 08:19.050
from the expansion pack.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.490
My lord...

08:24.230 --> 08:25.630

08:25.630 --> 08:28.570
Why do you ask? I'm not.

Oh...

08:30.530 --> 08:32.440

08:33.240 --> 08:34.710

08:37.460 --> 08:38.360
Yes.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.410
"Again today," you mean.

08:42.780 --> 08:43.820
Want me to hold them for you?

It really holds a ton!

08:57.490 --> 09:00.130
Wow, Minori! Your feminine power is sky-high!

09:03.380 --> 09:05.350
Okay, let's buy some things to take back.

09:05.690 --> 09:08.400
My lord, I want a red bead bun.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.270
Why not get a gelatin for once?

09:10.270 --> 09:12.110
Do you have a problem with red bean buns?

09:12.110 --> 09:13.860
Well, for some variety...

09:14.920 --> 09:16.870
It's not just a regular red bean bun today.

09:17.230 --> 09:18.670
It's cherry tree-scented red bean.

09:18.670 --> 09:20.180

09:20.180 --> 09:23.920
I want strawberry shortcake! I do!

09:25.750 --> 09:28.210
Get off my lord, you half-idol!

09:28.210 --> 09:29.780

I'm a complete, galactic, perfect idol!

09:34.090 --> 09:39.000
And Shiroe said he likes it when I hold him!

09:39.000 --> 09:39.640
I did not.

09:41.010 --> 09:41.890
I'll kill you.

09:41.890 --> 09:43.890
Buy me some cake!

09:43.890 --> 09:45.890

09:46.170 --> 09:48.400
The red bean bun is waiting, my lord.

09:52.140 --> 09:53.610

You've been a lot more relaxed lately.

10:02.920 --> 10:04.340
Oh, please.

10:04.340 --> 10:07.060
You aren't the type to worry about that.

10:07.060 --> 10:09.740
I'll have a cold one and the fried rockfish.

10:09.740 --> 10:10.420
Right!

10:10.780 --> 10:12.490
Another business trip?

10:12.490 --> 10:15.730
Don't say that. This is one of our restaurants.

10:15.730 --> 10:17.670
Of course I'll stop by to see the kitchen.

10:17.670 --> 10:23.480
I could've sworn I told you that this was 
a branch of Shopping District 8, Isaac.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.550

I'm sure there are people who want to go home.

Are you glad you came to this world, Serara?

12:43.800 --> 12:45.070
Um, yes.

12:45.770 --> 12:47.190
You are?

12:47.770 --> 12:48.590
Yes.

12:48.590 --> 12:51.750
Well, I can't see my mom and dad anymore,

12:51.750 --> 12:54.220
and lots of hard things have happened.

12:54.750 --> 12:57.320
But lots of good things have happened, too.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.280
And...

12:59.340 --> 13:02.720
I have a dream of what I want to be, and a future...

13:03.120 --> 13:04.550
You do?

13:04.550 --> 13:05.970
Yes.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.600
<i>I see.</i>

13:10.840 --> 13:16.190
<i>Children aren't invited to be born in this world.</i>

13:16.650 --> 13:20.520
<i>However, all children become young people</i>

13:20.520 --> 13:24.230
<i>and can be reborn by their own will,</i>

13:24.730 --> 13:28.160
<i>choosing their own lives.</i>

13:28.740 --> 13:29.700
Meow...

13:29.700 --> 13:34.190
I'm sure you can make any 
dream you have come true.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.610
B-B-But it's a long way away!

13:40.610 --> 13:44.470
Oh, I don't mean I'm going 
to give up or anything.

13:44.850 --> 13:50.120
But whenever I look at Isuzu and Minori, 
I feel like I'm lacking a little...

13:50.120 --> 13:52.220
Like I'm not good enough.

13:52.930 --> 13:58.980
I think I need to get better at being who I am

13:59.370 --> 14:01.810
before I make that dream come true.

14:02.510 --> 14:05.760
I have to be a fully-grown version of me.

14:06.830 --> 14:08.740
That's what I want to become.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.000
Serara...

14:12.000 --> 14:12.740
Yes!

14:13.120 --> 14:14.620
Just a little is fine.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.940
Every little bit is important.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.650
I'm cheering you on.

14:22.320 --> 14:25.010
So is everyone.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.020
<i>What would Kanami do?</i>

14:35.180 --> 14:38.460
<i>When I think about it, I was lucky.</i>

14:38.920 --> 14:42.180
<i>At the very start, when things were 
toughest, everyone was with me.</i>

14:44.300 --> 14:47.280
I'm grateful to Naotsugu and Akatsuki. Really.

14:47.660 --> 14:49.910
You can say "thank you," my lord.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.430
When did you get here?

14:51.430 --> 14:52.630
I flew here.

14:52.630 --> 14:53.640
By running along the roofs.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.660
You're really starting to become a ninja.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.160
I'm your ninja, my lord!

14:59.320 --> 15:02.170
So what's bothering you?

15:02.450 --> 15:03.940
Whenever something bothers you,

15:03.940 --> 15:07.690
you get wrinkles up here that make your 
forehead look like an old man's.

15:07.690 --> 15:08.760
Do I?

15:08.760 --> 15:09.930
You do.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.180
Oh, there you are, Shiro.

15:12.550 --> 15:14.500
I'm seeing something on my idol radar!

15:14.500 --> 15:16.390
A night rendezvous!

15:16.390 --> 15:19.340
So are you coming up with another plan?

15:19.690 --> 15:21.660
That's right... Are you coming up with a plan?

15:22.670 --> 15:29.790
Do you need a cute, attractive, and talented idol?

15:29.790 --> 15:31.580
You need a guardian, too, don't you?

15:32.080 --> 15:34.080
You two are in perfect harmony.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.000
Oh, my!

15:35.000 --> 15:36.750
Wh-Wh-What are you saying, Shiro?

15:37.140 --> 15:38.910
The two of us are as one now!

15:39.340 --> 15:41.120
We're like "Tetsugu"!

15:39.340 --> 15:41.120
<b>Tetsugu</b>

15:41.270 --> 15:44.610
<b>Roar 

Anchor Howl!!</b>

15:41.600 --> 15:44.930
The impenetrable armor of a Guardian,

15:44.610 --> 15:47.240
<b>Pah!</b>

15:44.930 --> 15:47.260
protected by my responsive heals!

15:47.680 --> 15:50.290
My love for him shines each time he's struck.

15:50.290 --> 15:53.410
In other words, Naotsugu's entranced by my love!

15:53.410 --> 15:54.260
I am not.

15:54.530 --> 15:56.580
You're such a shy boy, Naotsugu.

15:58.390 --> 15:59.580
Well?

15:59.580 --> 16:01.610
It's been almost a year since the Apocalypse.

16:02.090 --> 16:03.270
There are a lot of adventurers

16:03.880 --> 16:07.330
who haven't been able to adapt to 
this world, and want to go home.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.460
But there's no way to go home...

16:10.770 --> 16:11.530
Yeah.

16:11.920 --> 16:15.550
So Eins thinks we should save those people.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.970
He wants to take the money 
from wealthy adventurers,

16:18.970 --> 16:20.590
and give it to everyone, right?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.200
Will that really work?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.040
I doubt it.

16:26.620 --> 16:31.860
The only way for them to really be 
saved is for them to go home.

16:32.370 --> 16:33.300
And...

16:33.600 --> 16:35.930
War's coming to Yamato.

16:36.410 --> 16:37.710
Yeah...

16:39.760 --> 16:44.440
And one of the reasons for that 
is our arrival in this world.

16:44.800 --> 16:49.760
Then we need to find a way to get back home.

16:52.830 --> 16:55.220
There's something I need to tell you all.

16:56.580 --> 17:00.580
I'd like to hear it, too.

17:01.090 --> 17:02.080
Of course.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.250
<b>Log Horizon 
Older Members Meeting 

Be Sure You Knock</b>

17:06.210 --> 17:07.250
A letter, huh?

17:07.640 --> 17:08.880
A love letter?

17:09.320 --> 17:11.170
I wish.

17:11.710 --> 17:13.460
It was from Roe 2.

17:13.820 --> 17:15.390
My second character.

17:16.570 --> 17:21.300
The other body you left on the test 
server when this was a game?

17:21.300 --> 17:24.890
The rumor was that the test server 
was on the moon, right?

17:26.200 --> 17:27.020
The moon?

17:27.510 --> 17:30.420
Could they even write letters?

17:30.420 --> 17:32.490
And how did it get here?

17:32.790 --> 17:34.510
Minori brought it to me.

17:34.990 --> 17:36.950
She met Roe 2 during their travels.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.420
And... According to this letter,

17:40.960 --> 17:45.510
Roe 2 is the person I've been looking for.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.360
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

17:50.130 --> 17:53.260
Why did we come to this world?

17:54.130 --> 17:55.260
It doesn't make sense, right?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.900
If this really is another world,

17:57.900 --> 18:01.460
there's no way it could be this similar 
to the <i>Elder Tale</i> we know.

18:02.380 --> 18:05.160
But it's unbelievable that a game world

18:05.160 --> 18:08.160
became reality, and we went into it.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.150
It's impossible.

18:09.940 --> 18:14.050
As far as we know, technology 
hasn't advanced that far.

18:14.850 --> 18:16.250
Right.

18:16.820 --> 18:19.280
And the changes since the Apocalypse 
don't make any sense, either.

18:20.190 --> 18:25.290
In this world, physical laws and the 
game's laws are all jumbled up.

18:25.900 --> 18:29.060
It's like two different rule sets were 
just mixed together randomly.

18:29.740 --> 18:32.300
It's only a game in the weird parts, yeah.

18:32.300 --> 18:37.430
I get the feeling that we weren't 
simply sent to another world.

18:38.190 --> 18:44.180
And in this world, there must be a 
third party who can explain it.

18:44.650 --> 18:50.460
Someone who isn't a Person of the Land 
or a player like us, who can explain this.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.760
They brought us to this world?

18:52.760 --> 18:54.690
What did the letter say?

18:55.190 --> 18:58.250
Roe 2 took over my unused second character...

18:58.250 --> 19:02.910
That is, a body without a soul, 
and came to this world.

19:02.910 --> 19:04.450
Who is she?

19:05.040 --> 19:07.720
She calls herself a "Navigator."

19:08.380 --> 19:10.200
A sentient intelligence from another world.

19:10.200 --> 19:14.370
You might say a person from another 
world or, perhaps, an alien.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.090
They're artificially created creatures.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.870
<b>Observers</b>

19:18.830 --> 19:20.810
And there are two types. 
"Observers" like Roe 2,

19:20.870 --> 19:24.600
<b>Harvesters</b>

19:21.300 --> 19:24.050
and another type called "Harvesters."

19:25.370 --> 19:31.860
These Navigators were created to harvest 
a resource called "empathions."

19:32.250 --> 19:34.360
<b>Empathions</b>

19:32.720 --> 19:34.360
What are those?

19:34.960 --> 19:37.480
Unfortunately, she didn't say.

19:37.480 --> 19:43.010
But their society had run out of this 
resource and begun to decline.

19:43.430 --> 19:47.690
To resolve this crisis, another world was needed.

19:47.690 --> 19:52.260
And we were created to investigate other 
universes that could be searched.

19:53.700 --> 19:57.920
Roe 2 and her kind came here via 
what they called the "Match,"

19:56.630 --> 20:00.120
<b>Match</b>

19:57.920 --> 20:02.610
the same way the Apocalypse brought us here.

20:02.610 --> 20:05.430
Then does she know the Apocalypse's cause?

20:05.430 --> 20:09.640
No, it looks like they don't 
understand everything, either.

20:09.950 --> 20:13.560
So did they get these empathions?

20:14.010 --> 20:14.650
Well...

20:15.690 --> 20:20.090
"We believe you to be sentient 
intelligences of a rank 3 or higher.

20:20.570 --> 20:22.820
Minori and her friends proved that.

20:23.270 --> 20:26.870
Thus, the rights to this world's 
resources belong to you.

20:27.630 --> 20:30.760
The Harvesters are given orders 
to prioritize harvesting,

20:30.760 --> 20:34.130
but we Observers are tasked with searching.

20:34.990 --> 20:39.440
I don't know if my brother, Shiroe, 
will be the one to read this message,

20:39.990 --> 20:43.010
but I recommend acquiring a method 
of communication with the moon.

20:44.520 --> 20:47.800
Our community is on this world's moon,

20:47.800 --> 20:49.520
and we are observing the situation.

20:49.910 --> 20:54.520
If you wish to return, we can help you.

20:56.050 --> 20:59.390
Lastly, I'll warn you about the Harvesters.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.410
They are Navigators like us,

21:03.410 --> 21:06.030
but they are intelligences equivalent to rank 2.

21:06.840 --> 21:10.100
In this world, they're using 
bodies prepared on the moon

21:10.100 --> 21:13.360
of monsters with powerful combat capabilities.

21:14.730 --> 21:17.300
I recommend extreme caution."

21:20.770 --> 21:24.720
The Harvesters are most likely 
the monsters called "Geniuses."

21:25.140 --> 21:28.220
Then why are they after us adventurers?

21:28.790 --> 21:29.840
I don't know.

21:30.350 --> 21:32.150
"PS, Minori...

21:32.500 --> 21:35.020
I tried writing this seriously, 
like a big sister would.

21:35.360 --> 21:39.630
May your warm empathions light your future.

21:39.980 --> 21:42.490
<b>From your big sister.</b>

21:40.180 --> 21:41.470
From your big sister."

21:44.780 --> 21:46.870
There are still things we don't understand,

21:47.630 --> 21:51.240
but if we can make contact with 
Roe 2's companions on the moon,

21:51.240 --> 21:54.250
we may be able to find a hint to returning home.

21:54.510 --> 21:56.840
Are you going to believe that letter?

21:57.370 --> 21:58.680
I think we can.

21:59.050 --> 22:01.520
You have some reason, right?

22:02.380 --> 22:04.630
When I died in the Abyssal Shaft, I saw it...

22:05.840 --> 22:07.430
That was a beach on the moon.

22:08.090 --> 22:09.970
After reading this letter, I'm sure of it.

22:11.110 --> 22:12.850
That wasn't a dream.

22:13.150 --> 22:15.450
I... I saw it, too!

22:15.450 --> 22:17.850
Those sparkles I saw with you...

22:19.670 --> 22:21.650
I remember, my lord.

22:25.490 --> 22:28.990
If we can get back there,

22:30.010 --> 22:33.290
we can go home!

24:05.560 --> 24:08.730
Lenessia's little brother, Iselus, 
the Prince of Maihama.

24:08.730 --> 24:10.910
His birthday party is to be used to introduce him

24:10.910 --> 24:12.890
to the world as the next Lord of Maihama.

24:12.890 --> 24:17.160
But even during this celebration, 
the presence of war draws near.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.310
A cowardly shadow is after the young boy's life,

24:20.310 --> 24:22.350
and a black blade of rage howls at it.

24:22.900 --> 24:25.120
Next time: Isaac and Iselus.

24:22.900 --> 24:29.940
<b>Isaac and Iselus</b>

24:25.590 --> 24:27.430
I have friends to run with me.
