19:34.131 --> 19:36.967
<i>and everybody will come here
to dump their garbage on ya.</i>

19:37.050 --> 19:39.970
Which is what you did to <i>me!</i>
And that's the end!

19:40.053 --> 19:43.640
- No, <i>this </i> is the end...
- Of our tribute to Horatio Dump!

19:43.724 --> 19:46.602
[gasps] Wait, this is <i>your </i> tribute?

19:46.810 --> 19:50.480

19:51.982 --> 19:53.525
[coughs] Yay!

19:53.609 --> 19:55.235
Are you guys watching
the <i>Drool </i> movie?

19:55.319 --> 19:57.529
[coughing, belching]

19:57.613 --> 20:00.616
- I taste metal.
- Congratulations, boys!

20:00.699 --> 20:04.411
You won the Golden Dumpy <i>and </i> extra credit!

20:04.494 --> 20:06.288
And a couple of byahs!

20:06.371 --> 20:07.915
Byah! Byah-hh!

20:07.998 --> 20:11.210
Thanks! We'll take the extra credit,
but we can't accept this award.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.045
Because it belongs to Tubbadump!

20:13.128 --> 20:15.088
[gasps] Me? Really?

20:16.173 --> 20:17.216
An award?

20:18.008 --> 20:22.596
Oh, no, no, no, I... I couldn't.
I don't have anything prepared.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.096
Ahem.

20:24.598 --> 20:27.893
First, I would like to thank my family,
the Goobergs.

20:27.976 --> 20:30.020
Mom, Dad...

20:31.230 --> 20:32.773
[sobs] this is for you.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.193
My brother Goobert, my sister Goolia,
the Gooey twins,

- I...

20:37.194 --> 20:39.029
No, wait.
No, no, no, no not with the music.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.697
Not yet. No, I'm not... I'm not done.

20:40.781 --> 20:43.101
Please, I got more.
No, come on, you're not playing me off!

20:43.158 --> 20:45.786
Hey, expired club soda!

20:45.953 --> 20:47.621
I wonder if it's still got fizz!

20:50.832 --> 20:51.667
[Krupp groans] Oh-hh!

20:51.750 --> 20:53.377
I missed Dump Day!

20:53.460 --> 20:54.544
Must've been a good one,

20:54.628 --> 20:57.756
because my pants are gone
and a rat is biting me!

20:57.839 --> 20:59.883
[narrator reading]

20:59.967 --> 21:01.635
[faint squeaking]

21:01.927 --> 21:05.055
There. Now everyone can see
my Golden Dumpy.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.599
[sighs] This dump's way nicer
than Gooville.

21:07.683 --> 21:09.142
- I'm staying.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.857

You have a laser eye?
Why am I picking up this <i>trash?</i>

21:41.341 --> 21:42.426
Great question.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.803
When I have a laser eye,
I'm going to use it.

21:44.886 --> 21:48.098
Yeah, you think you will,
but then you have one and you never do.

21:48.181 --> 21:51.601
- Kind of like a treadmill.

is that the extra credit scored us
