<i>Previously on</i> Californication...

00:02.079 --> 00:04.446
I was talking to Dani
about our sexual problem.

00:04.705 --> 00:05.864
She's totally in.

00:07.709 --> 00:10.943
- I've got to get my camera. This is...
- Motherfucker!

00:11.213 --> 00:15.319
Most recently, I gave man birth
to a tome called "God hates us all."

00:15.459 --> 00:19.545
Which was turned into a movie called
"A crazy little thing called love."

00:19.805 --> 00:23.248
You drink too much, write too little,
and only take exercise in the bedroom.

00:23.558 --> 00:27.000
Some folks have compared
the wait for your new novel

00:27.140 --> 00:30.389
to the decade-plus wait
for the new <i>Guns n' Roses</i> album.

00:31.132 --> 00:34.017
- How's the new book coming?
- Now, that's a hostile question.

00:34.277 --> 00:35.602
I got you a ticket.

00:35.862 --> 00:38.188
I hope that's fully refundable
because I ain't going.

00:38.448 --> 00:40.419
You're not going to your dad's funeral?

00:40.579 --> 00:42.288
He was a fucking asshole.

00:42.571 --> 00:43.933
You're not your father.

<i>The white zone is for the immediate
loading and unloading of passengers.</i>

00:59.529 --> 01:00.479
Holy shit!

01:02.795 --> 01:05.292
I was just about
to call the super shuttle.

01:05.964 --> 01:08.308
How are you? How was it?

01:10.982 --> 01:12.612
Too much, right? With the pelvis?

01:12.923 --> 01:16.518
I thought maybe I could get a little
half a grind there, but maybe not.

01:16.771 --> 01:18.855
I'm not here to pick you up,
but Bill.

01:19.028 --> 01:21.537
You don't think I saw
Bilbo Baggins in 1st class?

01:21.677 --> 01:23.592
He doesn't travel very light...

01:24.219 --> 01:27.468
Give the guy a break.
He's been away for a month.

01:27.748 --> 01:32.121
- A lot can happen in a month. A lot <i>did.</i>
- You shut up. Don't say a word.

01:40.399 --> 01:42.481
Don't hold back on my account, guys.

01:42.781 --> 01:44.486
- I'm not.
- Really?

01:45.095 --> 01:49.377
'cause if it was me, I would grab that
ass. I would grab it like I owned it.

01:49.649 --> 01:51.562
Especially after
such a prolonged absence.

01:51.770 --> 01:56.074
Would now be the appropriate time, Hank,
to say how sorry I am for your loss?

01:56.561 --> 02:00.830
It would have been more appropriate
3 h ago with a free drink and a sundae.

02:01.039 --> 02:02.965
What were you doing
with those hot towels?

02:03.153 --> 02:06.527
- You got a bad case of swamp ass?
- It must have been a very long flight.

02:06.787 --> 02:08.987
I think this is where
we should part company.

02:09.247 --> 02:12.029
- I see a cab with my name on it.
- Don't be ridiculous.

02:12.256 --> 02:15.948
- Bill, it's just a figure of speech.
- We'll give you a ride home.

02:16.141 --> 02:18.517
Really? That's mighty white of you.

02:18.799 --> 02:21.667
No, he loves cabs.
It reminds him of the big apple.

02:21.926 --> 02:25.119
There's no need to punish
the environment unnecessarily.

02:25.259 --> 02:29.109
- That, you will put out, of course.
- This, yeah. Of course, yeah.

02:29.768 --> 02:31.150
And... here.

02:33.732 --> 02:35.041
I got shotgun.

03:21.106 --> 03:22.345
No way, man.

03:22.924 --> 03:26.023
What the fuck is so great
about that $30 salad, anyway?

03:28.395 --> 03:31.053
Yeah, shit. Okay, yeah. Fine, whatever.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.921
That's fine. 8:00.

03:33.982 --> 03:35.536
You weren't cooking tonight?

03:35.756 --> 03:38.452
I've got to go to Koi
for the 400th fucking time.

03:39.723 --> 03:43.009
Sometimes, I'm surprised
I don't shit crispy rice with spicy tuna.

03:44.330 --> 03:47.696
I bring you something home?
Maybe some baked crab roll?

03:47.865 --> 03:51.256
We could eat it in bed while we watch
all those <i>CSI Miamis</i> I saved up.

03:51.516 --> 03:54.755
A little late-night snack
with your snack daddy?

03:55.192 --> 03:56.192
I'm good.

03:56.426 --> 03:59.585
I actually think
I might have a thing tonight.

04:02.094 --> 04:03.099
A thing?

04:03.499 --> 04:05.646
I'm thinking about going to book club.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.794
Well, you'll be home early, then.

04:09.338 --> 04:11.038
Earlyish, I guess.

04:11.892 --> 04:14.947
Why so curious all of a sudden?
You said you were going out tonight.

04:15.207 --> 04:17.286
I'm not. I'm not curious
all of a sudden.

04:17.426 --> 04:19.863
I happen to know
you fucking hate book club.

04:20.060 --> 04:23.038
When you commit to something,
you're supposed to stick with it.

04:24.698 --> 04:25.806
Sure.

04:29.439 --> 04:32.475
I guess I'll leave you to it, then.
See you later.

04:34.265 --> 04:35.336
Later.

05:32.376 --> 05:35.103
- Dad!
- That's my name. Don't wear it out.

05:37.753 --> 05:40.343
You guys. My God.
That was incredible.

05:40.605 --> 05:42.565
I want you to play that song
at the wedding.

05:42.772 --> 05:45.983
- Let's not get carried away.
- What? What do you mean?

05:46.255 --> 05:47.623
You're very, very good.

05:48.393 --> 05:52.461
I think if you give them some time,
they could bone up on some Supertramp.

05:52.721 --> 05:55.213
I don't get it.
You don't want them to play that song?

05:57.065 --> 06:00.260
No, I don't mean anything. I thought
we decided on the string quartet.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.470
Bill, what?

06:01.739 --> 06:02.981
Dan Fogelberg.

06:03.326 --> 06:05.287
And I think, perhaps...

06:05.693 --> 06:07.143
- Hey, Bec.
- Yes, posh.

06:07.777 --> 06:09.311
Our guests could use a beverage.

06:09.571 --> 06:10.395
Agreed.

06:11.906 --> 06:14.149
I don't want to get your hopes up, guys.

06:14.409 --> 06:16.419
But you keep rolling
with the marital discord,

06:16.559 --> 06:19.186
and I see you across from Oprah
on a big yellow couch.

06:19.326 --> 06:20.576
Fingers crossed.

06:25.322 --> 06:28.038
Okay, great.
Thank you. Are you coming up?

06:28.326 --> 06:29.655
No. Why?

06:29.992 --> 06:33.460
- For make up the sex.
- Are you fucking insane, Hank?

06:33.726 --> 06:36.016
Do the seats on this recline?

06:36.984 --> 06:39.773
Whatever sex we're gonna have,
we've had, okay?

06:40.125 --> 06:42.177
It's little late to play hard to get.

06:42.437 --> 06:44.921
We need to start acting
like we split up already.

06:45.110 --> 06:46.541
Let's just forget about it.

06:46.768 --> 06:49.219
Who could forget
such a knee-rattling orgasm?

06:49.359 --> 06:52.312
You were grieving.
I was co-grieving. It was a slip.

06:52.572 --> 06:55.190
I think you knocked something
loose down there, tiger.

06:56.140 --> 06:57.558
I wrote something.

06:59.726 --> 07:01.176
That's great, Hank.

07:02.076 --> 07:04.367
I don't think you heard me.
I wrote something.

07:04.531 --> 07:07.786
Not that blog shit. That's why
I was in New York for so long.

07:07.926 --> 07:10.267
I just sat down
at my mother's Old Smith Corona.

07:10.456 --> 07:14.793
I didn't get up for two weeks.
I got pages here, honey. Many pages.

07:15.053 --> 07:18.672
- It's rough, but it's something.
- Great. I wish you a lot of luck.

07:18.932 --> 07:21.925
You fucked it out of me, and now
you don't want to take responsibility?

07:22.185 --> 07:25.353
You know, fuck you.
I'm not that person anymore, okay.

07:25.493 --> 07:28.932
I'm not your fucking
sounding-board-Cum-security blanket.

07:29.192 --> 07:31.251
You're not in the least bit interested?

07:31.420 --> 07:34.354
- Yes, of course.
- Fine, then it's settled. There it is.

07:34.626 --> 07:36.806
I'm not taking no for an answer.

07:37.379 --> 07:39.651
I'm sure it's very good.
I'm sure it's excellent.

07:39.911 --> 07:43.296
Most likely, it's a piece of crap.
I won't know until you tell me.

07:43.465 --> 07:46.585
'cause that's the way it goes.
I give it to you, and you tell me.

07:46.754 --> 07:49.456
I don't see the difference between
the ridiculous and the sublime

07:49.663 --> 07:52.075
until <i>you</i> tell <i>me.</i>
Now, be careful with that.

07:52.424 --> 07:54.040
You've got my life there in your hands.

07:54.300 --> 07:57.460
This is just words, you know.
It's words, okay. Take it.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.255
Well, words is all I have left
to play with.

08:00.526 --> 08:02.106
So be gentle.

08:02.392 --> 08:05.329
Please tell Becca
to expect a gentleman caller.

08:05.603 --> 08:07.220
Hank, please, take this.

08:07.485 --> 08:10.261
Honestly, thank you. Smell you later.

08:11.514 --> 08:12.519
Fuck.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.937
Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it!

08:44.183 --> 08:47.260
- Okay, you're a good agent.
- That's right, motherfucker!

08:47.520 --> 08:50.985
If it hadn't been for me putting
that little clause in your contract,

08:51.125 --> 08:53.516
then you wouldn't be holding
that big, fat wad of cash.

08:53.776 --> 08:56.074
Yeah, fucking blood money is what it is.

08:56.214 --> 08:58.021
Who the fuck cares what it is?

08:58.281 --> 09:00.245
Thanks to
the aggressively mediocre taste

09:00.385 --> 09:03.526
of the American movie going public,
you now get to reap the benefits.

09:03.860 --> 09:06.081
Bonus time, baby. Treat yourself.

09:06.426 --> 09:07.893
Treat myself?

09:08.368 --> 09:10.825
- Get yourself a new car.
- I don't want a new car.

09:11.085 --> 09:12.827
I like my old one. It's got character.

09:13.087 --> 09:17.086
If by that, you mean lady juice in every
nook and cranny of the upholstery,

09:17.226 --> 09:18.917
then, yes, you're totally right.

09:19.177 --> 09:21.586
- That explains a lot, actually.
- Get it washed then.

09:21.846 --> 09:23.885
Now you could probably
even get yourself

09:24.025 --> 09:26.299
one of those little
prepaid coupon booklets.

09:26.559 --> 09:29.005
You put it in the glove compartment.
That's how I roll.

09:29.262 --> 09:31.753
- That's how you roll?
- That's how I roll, baby.

09:31.893 --> 09:34.321
I did purchase
what is commonly referred to

09:34.528 --> 09:37.214
by the kids as a big-ticket item.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.411
What'd be that?

09:43.008 --> 09:45.661
OK. I'm getting a bad feeling here.

09:45.954 --> 09:48.655
- Why is that?
- I'm thinking you intend to give that

09:48.915 --> 09:51.241
to someone who might already be engaged.

09:51.501 --> 09:54.524
- That's the plan, motherfucker.
- Don't do this to yourself, Hank.

09:55.064 --> 09:57.247
Come on, Charlie.
Don't do what to myself?

09:57.507 --> 09:59.541
Give up what I want?
I've done the research.

09:59.801 --> 10:02.034
Karen and I belong together.
And I feel good.

10:02.204 --> 10:05.619
Lately... just the past little while,
things are looking up for me.

10:05.759 --> 10:07.590
I feel a change. I wrote something.

10:07.926 --> 10:08.932
Wait.

10:09.497 --> 10:10.504
You what?

10:13.098 --> 10:14.949
You wrote something? Okay.

10:16.490 --> 10:18.807
I've dreamed
about this moment, alright,

10:19.033 --> 10:21.350
the one where you come to me,
pages in hand.

10:21.557 --> 10:24.316
You say, "please read this."
I do, and it's fucking genius.

10:24.606 --> 10:29.033
I sell it, we both get back on track,
and we live happily ever fucking after.

10:29.459 --> 10:31.309
Fuck me. No pressure there.

10:31.449 --> 10:33.908
What is it? A screenplay?
A short story? What?

10:34.168 --> 10:36.369
No more screenplays for me.
It's a novel.

10:37.526 --> 10:41.328
It's a short novel. It's a modern-day
answer to "Lolita," really.

10:41.535 --> 10:45.096
You know, an older man
unwittingly beds an underage girl.

10:45.388 --> 10:48.186
It unravels his life completely.
High jinks ensue.

10:48.326 --> 10:50.963
Broner. You gave me a broner.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.209
Where is it? Let me read it!

10:53.479 --> 10:55.180
Dani, cancel my lunch!

10:55.440 --> 10:57.891
I gave it to Karen.
She reads all my stuff first.

10:58.151 --> 11:01.914
So? Slip me a copy. I promise
I won't read it till after she's done.

11:02.102 --> 11:04.753
That's the only one.
I went old-school this time.

11:04.893 --> 11:06.816
I hunted and pecked
like a motherfucker.

11:07.076 --> 11:09.020
Whatever.
This is great fucking news!

11:09.189 --> 11:12.981
I'm not so sure, Charlie.
I mean, you know, most likely, it sucks.

11:13.131 --> 11:16.352
Well, that's where I come in.
I'll sell the shit out of it.

11:16.662 --> 11:19.338
By the time I get through spinning,
nobody will be able to tell

11:19.756 --> 11:22.665
if it's a piece of shit or the work
of staggering genius.

11:22.992 --> 11:24.542
There's a difference?

11:54.163 --> 11:55.163
Hi.

11:56.151 --> 11:57.635
Leave me alone.

11:58.405 --> 12:00.421
- A hostile...
- No, I'm browsing.

12:00.647 --> 12:04.247
If I have any questions, I'll ask you.
Now, shoo, you little parasite, you.

12:06.217 --> 12:08.251
- She's still coming...
- What do you do?

12:08.979 --> 12:11.683
- I'm a writer.
- Oh, yeah? Movies? TV?

12:12.415 --> 12:15.467
Books. Novels. The occasional <i>haiku</i>.

12:16.700 --> 12:19.334
Alright, well, let me know
if you have any questions.

12:19.606 --> 12:20.972
What the fuck was that?

12:21.726 --> 12:24.024
- What?
- You think I can't afford

12:24.231 --> 12:26.811
this penile implant on wheels,
so you're done with me.

12:27.085 --> 12:29.157
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

12:29.345 --> 12:30.607
Guy's got feelings.

12:33.438 --> 12:35.487
This one. I want to drive this one.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.797
- Let me get the keys.
- Please.

12:43.410 --> 12:45.580
- I love L.A.
- So, what do you think?

12:46.278 --> 12:48.506
- It's really clean.
- That's it?

12:49.052 --> 12:51.993
This is one of the finest automobiles
the world has to offer.

12:52.133 --> 12:53.421
I'm not a big car guy.

12:53.681 --> 12:56.951
I think if I got to open it up
past, like, 7 mph,

12:57.133 --> 12:59.117
I might really fall in love with it.

12:59.386 --> 13:02.426
Will you get off that fucking phone
before I stuff it up your ass?

13:02.566 --> 13:05.840
- Hey, buddy!
- What, are you kidding me?

13:06.466 --> 13:08.436
I kid you not, sir. Shame on you.

13:08.715 --> 13:10.765
Mind your own fucking business.

13:10.993 --> 13:12.914
You don't wanna be that guy.
Look at her!

13:13.122 --> 13:16.277
She's perfect. She's drop-dead.
She's firecrackers on the 4th!

13:16.584 --> 13:18.905
You'll never do better, but she can.
You see?

13:23.380 --> 13:24.868
So, tell me something.

13:26.155 --> 13:29.396
What do I have to do
to get you into this car?

13:31.212 --> 13:33.303
Well, let's talk about the extras.

13:49.174 --> 13:52.397
I like the BMW, too, though.
No, I like it. It's roomy.

13:52.996 --> 13:55.181
It's leather! Leather!

14:03.733 --> 14:05.583
Hey, honey, your dad's here!

14:08.499 --> 14:11.340
- What the fuck is that?
- Just ignore that.

14:11.649 --> 14:13.499
It's hard. It's very shiny.

14:13.886 --> 14:15.259
- What about that?
- What?

14:15.446 --> 14:18.715
Any thoughts? Notes?
Did the kool-aid still taste as sweet?

14:18.975 --> 14:22.524
Shall I turn around so you can
blow smoke up my ass more easily?

14:22.718 --> 14:26.268
- You wanna fuck me 'cause I'm a genius?
- I didn't have time, sorry.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.360
- I really am.
- No, don't be sorry. I mean...

14:31.028 --> 14:33.229
I just thought you'd be more intrigued.

14:33.542 --> 14:35.306
No, I am intrigued.

14:35.476 --> 14:37.649
- I'm also kind of...
- Horny?

14:39.938 --> 14:44.233
No, what? Like you? Like 23 hours a day?
Like some rutting moose, no.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.660
The Billdo is back in black,
and you're not warm for his form.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.788
That shit tells me something.

14:50.048 --> 14:53.131
I'll just grab the Becca.
You have things to read.

14:53.450 --> 14:55.544
It's even more phallic
than the last one.

14:55.845 --> 14:58.337
- You like?
- I liked the old one better.

14:58.855 --> 15:02.081
It had character...
And a funky smell.

15:02.868 --> 15:05.295
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

15:06.256 --> 15:08.618
I suggest you brew
one of your special teas,

15:08.825 --> 15:11.709
settle into a backbreaking piece
of modern furniture,

15:11.849 --> 15:14.097
and curl up with your favorite author.

15:14.363 --> 15:17.106
A Martin Amis, or a Virginia Woolf
or a Charles Bukowksi?

15:17.377 --> 15:18.715
Imposters, all.

15:30.461 --> 15:31.771
Whatever I want?

15:32.687 --> 15:34.100
Whatever you want.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.668
The possibilities are endless.

15:36.838 --> 15:39.637
Go with something classic and timeless,

15:39.900 --> 15:43.656
something that looks like Keith Richards
might have throw up on it at some point,

15:44.338 --> 15:48.671
something that would make Jon Bon Jovi
quake in his acid-washed jeans.

15:49.816 --> 15:50.984
Like that one?

15:51.398 --> 15:52.886
This blue one? Yeah.

15:53.576 --> 15:57.626
- Hey, man. Is Dave around, man?
- No, he's on vacation.

15:59.617 --> 16:02.619
- You need some help?
- No, he's an old friend of mine.

16:02.826 --> 16:05.488
I just figured he could help me
with some cash.

16:06.878 --> 16:07.740
Bummer.

16:11.295 --> 16:12.787
Come on, pretty girl.

16:15.133 --> 16:16.097
Father?

16:16.872 --> 16:17.872
Offspring?

16:18.953 --> 16:20.648
That was a nice guitar.

16:20.854 --> 16:24.604
Yes. Sometimes, it's best not to get
involved in the affairs of others.

16:25.072 --> 16:26.522
That's interesting,

16:26.736 --> 16:29.053
coming from
the most intrusive man I know.

16:32.768 --> 16:34.012
Hey, excuse me!

16:35.695 --> 16:38.103
That's a beautiful fiddle
you've got there.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.482
- Yeah?
- Yeah, how much you want for it?

16:40.702 --> 16:42.974
- It's worth a lot, man.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

16:43.232 --> 16:45.612
I can put it on EBay
and get over 10 grand, easy.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.034
Yeah, how much you want for it?

16:48.633 --> 16:51.866
- I'd take a grand.
- You said it's worth 10 at least, no?

16:52.086 --> 16:55.204
Yeah, well... you gotta do
what you gotta do, man.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.831
Yeah, I hear that.

17:00.878 --> 17:02.128
How about 13.5?

17:02.388 --> 17:05.973
- Come on, man. Don't fuck with me.
- I'm a couple hundred short.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.101
If you give me your address,
I can send you a check.

17:15.516 --> 17:17.621
Don't worry about it.
Just play it in good health.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.089
Thank you.

17:21.324 --> 17:23.453
My lady, your ax awaits.

17:24.453 --> 17:26.284
- You're a good daughter.
- My hair.

17:26.526 --> 17:27.883
Sorry. Come on.

17:36.525 --> 17:38.081
I have a confession to make.

17:39.220 --> 17:41.583
- Yes?
- You know what you said earlier

17:41.855 --> 17:44.796
about not wanting Becca
to play at the wedding?

17:46.099 --> 17:48.115
Bill, that really bothered me.

17:48.407 --> 17:50.615
Sorry. I didn't mean anything by it.

17:50.823 --> 17:53.513
I just don't want our wedding
to be some big joke.

17:53.777 --> 17:56.983
I don't want it to be
some kind of adults-only affair,

17:57.171 --> 18:00.355
you know, all stuffy.
I want it to be fun and whimsical

18:00.562 --> 18:03.275
and something
we're gonna remember forever.

18:03.574 --> 18:07.914
Alright, I hear you.
Maybe Becca can learn some...

18:09.012 --> 18:11.961
Van Morrison.
There's nothing that makes this man cry

18:12.250 --> 18:14.075
like a little "Brown eyed girl."

18:14.382 --> 18:16.285
That's definitely a compromise.

18:19.312 --> 18:21.124
There's something else
I want to tell...

18:21.527 --> 18:23.648
One second! One second...

18:26.492 --> 18:28.960
- Hi, Bill.
- "Dad" or "daddy," please.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.065
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:31.232 --> 18:34.547
- What's this?
- It's Hank's new book.

18:34.970 --> 18:37.991
Hank wrote a new book?
Well, fuck me running!

18:38.958 --> 18:40.790
Sorry. Can I read it?

18:42.406 --> 18:44.600
I don't think that's appropriate.

18:44.903 --> 18:45.969
Well, is it good?

18:47.042 --> 18:49.319
- I haven't read it yet.
- Why not?

18:51.122 --> 18:52.280
What is this?

18:59.257 --> 19:02.415
- Oh, my god. How did you even
- Well, I remembered you saying

19:02.675 --> 19:05.147
how much you liked
the view from your dorm room so...

19:05.693 --> 19:08.395
I convinced these
lovely little N.Y.U co-eds

19:08.535 --> 19:10.529
to let me take
a picture from their dorm room,

19:10.669 --> 19:13.134
which, once upon a time,
was your dorm room.

19:14.502 --> 19:15.609
You're just adorable.

19:15.896 --> 19:17.138
Well, I try.

19:20.281 --> 19:22.631
Now, what was it you wanted to tell me?

19:24.349 --> 19:25.501
Oh, nothing.

19:26.056 --> 19:28.119
No, nothing.
Come here. Come here.

19:35.731 --> 19:38.539
Get that sweet, little hairless
ass of yours downstairs!

19:38.721 --> 19:43.158
- We've got some celebrating to do!
- Hey, I thought you had a dinner.

19:43.298 --> 19:45.514
I did. I bailed at the last second.

19:45.972 --> 19:48.022
I wanted to see <i>you.</i>

19:48.654 --> 19:49.544
Why?

19:50.348 --> 19:52.340
I need an excuse to see my wife
all of a sudden?

19:52.612 --> 19:55.592
No, it's just --
What is there to celebrate?

19:55.908 --> 19:57.749
Hank wrote something.

19:59.142 --> 20:01.479
Well, kudos to Hank. He's a writer.

20:01.859 --> 20:03.168
This is a big deal, sweetie.

20:03.308 --> 20:05.693
This is like the return of old Hank.

20:05.849 --> 20:08.189
Or I don't know.
Maybe it's the new Hank.

20:08.852 --> 20:11.975
But the guy,
he came into my office today

20:12.169 --> 20:15.805
with a giant engagement ring
he bought for Karen.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.949
What? What are you talking about?

20:18.209 --> 20:20.518
The only thing I could think
when I saw it was, "hope".

20:20.759 --> 20:21.762
Baby, hope.

20:22.468 --> 20:26.501
Things have been just really fucked-up
around here. You know it, too, right?

20:26.679 --> 20:28.709
Ever since, well, the nipple incident.

20:29.544 --> 20:31.184
Or, actually, before then.

20:31.430 --> 20:33.670
But the thing I realize now is

20:33.902 --> 20:36.777
that I was
just really depressed, you know.

20:36.975 --> 20:39.167
If Hank can get his shit together,
so can I.

20:39.356 --> 20:42.516
- and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
- Good for you, Charlie.

20:43.845 --> 20:46.237
And I want you to know, baby,
that I'm sorry.

20:47.932 --> 20:48.985
For what?

20:49.820 --> 20:51.911
For letting us get
to a place in our lives

20:52.119 --> 20:55.486
where we thought we needed a threesome
to get ourselves back on track.

20:55.826 --> 20:57.570
You don't have to apologize for that.

20:57.712 --> 20:59.857
Yes, I do, because it is just not right.

21:00.057 --> 21:01.626
I want you to know...

21:02.067 --> 21:03.803
That you are all I need, baby.

21:05.087 --> 21:06.620
You're right, Charlie.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.271
Things have changed since nipple-gate.

21:09.828 --> 21:12.587
Yes, and I want to go right back
where we were before.

21:14.019 --> 21:16.315
Yeah, I don't think that's possible.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.713
Good. Me, too.

21:18.533 --> 21:20.678
Or -- wait. What?
You -- what? You don't?

21:22.656 --> 21:24.200
The thing with your teat

21:24.455 --> 21:26.246
made things very clear to me.

21:26.527 --> 21:28.769
The morning after
our ill-fated threesome,

21:29.035 --> 21:30.036
I woke up,

21:30.204 --> 21:33.191
and the only thing
I wanted to do was call Dani.

21:33.451 --> 21:36.235
Now, I don't know if that
makes me a fucking rug-muncher.

21:37.949 --> 21:40.040
But that sweet, little Goth nutjob

21:40.232 --> 21:43.263
makes this girl want to
put her finger in the dike.

21:44.747 --> 21:45.936
What are you saying?

21:50.426 --> 21:52.084
What the fuck?

21:52.816 --> 21:55.030
Oh, we were watching <i>Bound</i> just now.

21:55.242 --> 21:57.131
You're right. That shit is hot.

21:57.391 --> 21:59.300
You do have quite a movie collection.

21:59.564 --> 22:00.671
And quite a wife.

22:04.234 --> 22:05.560
You're fired, missy.

22:05.802 --> 22:07.114
Too late, boss.

22:07.332 --> 22:09.612
I think it's time I moved on
to a new desk.

22:11.096 --> 22:14.148
- Maybe I'll even be an agent someday.
- I know about everything.

22:14.408 --> 22:17.443
I know about the "s" and "m"
and the light "b" and "d".

22:17.860 --> 22:20.238
And I'm not mad. I'm just kind of sad.

22:20.667 --> 22:23.599
And sexually awakened.
I think we should go out there

22:23.739 --> 22:25.826
and fuck all the people we never fucked.

22:26.291 --> 22:28.883
Let's just rock out with our cocks out!

22:29.242 --> 22:32.162
Carpe motherfucking diem, baby!

22:35.504 --> 22:37.274
What if I don't want to...

22:38.224 --> 22:40.000
rock out with my cock out?

22:50.919 --> 22:52.121
What is that?

22:52.862 --> 22:54.939
What about the guitar Bill got you?

22:55.255 --> 22:56.744
This one's special.

22:57.524 --> 22:59.313
Timeless. Classic.

23:00.274 --> 23:03.267
It looks like Keith Richards
threw up on it back in the '70s.

23:03.454 --> 23:04.835
"Back in the '70s."

23:05.125 --> 23:06.367
Thanks, dad.

23:06.627 --> 23:08.493
You're welcome. Now go practice.

23:08.633 --> 23:11.460
Extra loud so you
annoy the neighbors and Bill.

23:11.652 --> 23:13.457
I've got to talk to your mom.

23:20.627 --> 23:22.510
A chill just ran up my sack.

23:22.879 --> 23:25.691
Hold on a second.
I've got to prepare myself.

23:26.409 --> 23:27.447
Yeah, me too.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.695
Okay, just like old times.

23:32.987 --> 23:35.404
Give it to me straight. I want it all.

23:35.650 --> 23:36.664
Here we go.

23:38.756 --> 23:39.835
Lay it on me.

23:40.066 --> 23:41.228
Brutal truth.

23:42.915 --> 23:43.921
I can't.

23:44.221 --> 23:45.933
You love ripping me to shreds.

23:46.140 --> 23:48.947
It's not as much fun
when I give you permission?

23:50.323 --> 23:51.657
Look at me.

23:55.795 --> 23:57.339
You didn't read it.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.129
You didn't fucking read it.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.214
I can't read it, Hank.

24:07.119 --> 24:08.119
Why not?

24:08.700 --> 24:11.619
Because... I can't go back.

24:12.890 --> 24:15.118
That part of my life is over now.

24:17.657 --> 24:21.684
There are a number of things going
through my mind to say to you right now,

24:21.910 --> 24:23.955
but only one is coming to the forefront.

24:24.106 --> 24:25.322
And that is...

24:27.010 --> 24:29.742
- Fuck, we had the sex, Karen.
- Shut the fuck up!

24:30.002 --> 24:32.306
Shutting me up is not
gonna make it any less true.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.192
You know what?
That was a onetime thing, okay?

24:35.468 --> 24:37.764
It's done. I mean, I don't regret it.

24:38.194 --> 24:40.669
Why would you?
You came, like, three times?

24:41.494 --> 24:43.275
Hank, now I regret it, okay?

24:43.562 --> 24:45.066
Now I do regret it.

24:54.176 --> 24:56.527
Hank, the fact that you wrote this
is fucking incredible

24:56.678 --> 24:58.216
I'm so proud of you.

24:58.549 --> 25:02.607
And I'm so glad that you have finally
opened a new chapter in your life.

25:02.750 --> 25:06.675
And it's here, and it's great.
You have to do it on your own, okay?

25:11.843 --> 25:13.428
What if I don't want to?

25:17.235 --> 25:20.679
What if I want to go back
and do it all over again?

25:22.425 --> 25:23.614
Only this time...

25:25.138 --> 25:27.280
Not make the same mistakes.
This time...

25:27.483 --> 25:28.384
do it better.

25:30.898 --> 25:32.545
This time, do it right.

25:34.097 --> 25:34.985
With...

25:35.624 --> 25:36.469
jewelry.

25:39.011 --> 25:41.396
I don't love you anymore.

25:42.840 --> 25:43.967
I love Bill.

25:44.989 --> 25:46.560
I'm gonna marry Bill.

25:46.897 --> 25:49.020
And I really need you
to respect that.

25:54.294 --> 25:55.879
I'm a fucking asshole.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.750
I'm a motherfucking asshole.

26:24.199 --> 26:26.942
Do you know how
to get to the 45 from here?

26:27.202 --> 26:28.247
On foot?

26:30.947 --> 26:32.737
You could walk over to Lincoln.

26:32.934 --> 26:36.682
Get the fuck out of the car,
motherfucker! Get out of the car!

26:38.637 --> 26:41.482
- Get out of the car!
- Get the fuck out now!

26:42.904 --> 26:44.863
Come on! Get in, let's go!

26:45.895 --> 26:46.906
Shut the fuck up!
