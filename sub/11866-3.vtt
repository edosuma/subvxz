00:20.020 --> 00:21.180
You good?

00:21.230 --> 00:22.515
I'm good.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.001
You need to come with me.

00:53.136 --> 00:56.378
Carter! What did you do?

00:58.642 --> 01:00.507
Why did you shoot Henry?

01:02.980 --> 01:05.517
(STAMMERING)
I don't remember.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.727
I don't remember anything.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.412
Be reasonable, Carter.

01:22.499 --> 01:26.492
I went back to check some
of my own personnel files,
and they'd been classified.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.043
(LAUGHING)
I mean, they're my files.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.919
It's not my fault that
there are things
about yourself

01:30.007 --> 01:31.463
that you're just
not cleared to know.

01:31.550 --> 01:34.963
Yeah, I'd hate to stumble
across something that if I
told me, I'd have to kill me.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.133
Right? What's next?

01:36.221 --> 01:39.884
They going to classify the
contents of my fridge,
my undenNear drawer?

01:39.933 --> 01:44.472
You think agents of a
foreign government would
be after your unden/vear?

01:44.563 --> 01:47.521
Maybe. I can pretty up
when I want to.

01:55.616 --> 01:59.655
Jack, come here.
I want you to meet two
of my oldest friends.

01:59.745 --> 02:00.860
(CHUCKLING)

02:00.954 --> 02:02.615
Kim, this is the new
Sheriff, Jack Carter.

02:02.706 --> 02:03.786
Good to meet you.
Good to meet you.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.118
And the man himself,
Jason Anderson.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.908
Hey.
A pleasure, Sheriff.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.292
Good to meet you.

02:46.625 --> 02:47.831

Decaffeinated tea for Zoe.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.750
Oh, come on.
l was up all night
reading Shakespeare.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.882
Uh-huh. You're really into
that school play, huh?

03:03.517 --> 03:05.098
Yeah. You know...

03:05.185 --> 03:09.053
I think drama club
is really helping me
find myself emotionally.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.684
| feel like I'm really
starting to fit in.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.686
How many classes
you get to skip
for rehearsal?

03:13.735 --> 03:16.898
Last period every day.
lncluding geometry.
Love drama.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.853
That's what I thought.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.358
Do you remember
my school plays
when l was a kid?

03:22.411 --> 03:23.617
Mmm-hmm.

03:23.995 --> 03:26.657
Remember third grade,
Parade of Nutrition?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.698
You remember
my cucumber outfit?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.251
Mmm-hmm.
Do you?

03:32.337 --> 03:33.372
Yes.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.546
Zoe, you were the cutest
cucumber in the garden.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.210
l was a tomato, actually.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.559
Oh, yeah.

03:46.601 --> 03:47.886
You weren't at
Parade of Nutrition.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.346
I knew you were a vegetable.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.603
In fact, you weren't
at anything I ever did.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.396
Come on, it's not like
you did anything
in those plays.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.932
You just sort of sat there
looking...

03:55.026 --> 03:57.108
| sat there looking...

03:58.405 --> 04:00.896
Come on, Zoe.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.774
Work was crazy back then.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.367
But it's different here.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.495
SARAH: There ’s a visitor
at the door.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.581
It is different.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.078
Mmm-hmm.
It is.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.702
Mmm-hmm.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.212
SARAH: Alert.
There ’s a visitor at the door.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.043
Nobody there, SARAH.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.090
All right, don't tune me out
with the newspaper.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.294

with the newspaper.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.468
Forget I said anything.

04:24.556 --> 04:27.172

a visitor at the door.
Hey.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.058
SARAH, there's nobody
at the door!

04:31.772 --> 04:33.262
Hello, Sheriff.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.185
l'm Putnam.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.695

What are you, like, 11?

04:42.532 --> 04:44.614
He's a senior.
Twelve, actually.

04:45.285 --> 04:49.619
Put it in gear, lamb chop,
I wanna run through Act One
before first period.

04:49.664 --> 04:53.031
Space is time,
time is relative,
and all of it's money.

04:53.210 --> 04:57.579
I gotta grab my costume from
Vincent after school and then
I have rehearsal until 6:00.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.799
You asked Vincent
to make your costume?

04:59.841 --> 05:03.629
Sir, you should know,
your daughter's an
incredible talent.

05:04.179 --> 05:07.296
Her audition, she was
blackbody radiation in 1901.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.309
Changed the paradigm.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.645
Let's roll.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.402
Oh, yeah,
and a tomato is a fruit.

05:35.627 --> 05:39.165
HENRY: Hey.
Table food has always
been community property.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.547

06:09.077 --> 06:11.033
Well, don't get
used to it.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.365
We finish this
project for Stark,
we're off to Geneva.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.451
Oh, no.
I know. I know. I know.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.750
But Jason doesn't like
staying anyplace
for too long.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.452
And he does his
best work on the road.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.038
Well, you can't
argue with results.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.754
Hey, listen,
Jason would never ask,

06:28.680 --> 06:31.046
but we could use
your help on this one.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.179
What?
The Wonder Twins
do not need my help.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.513
We do.

06:37.856 --> 06:41.724
We're stuck, and Stark's
already scheduled
a D.O.D. field test.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.061
Come on, it'll be fun.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.236
Like those all-nighters
we used to pull at JPL.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.981

picking this up.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.387
Yeah, I'm saving her
the trip.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.597
Be careful with
the tentacles.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.889
I thought they were
doing Shakespeare.
Putnam's re-imagining it.
He's...

07:21.942 --> 07:25.025
He's a visionary.
And I thought
he was just annoying.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.527
None of the white stuff,
right?

07:27.614 --> 07:29.570
Hey, hands off the wife.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.279
l was just recruiting him
to help us out
on the body armor.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.444
Ah, just like old times.
Yeah.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.789
Speaking of which...
Yeah.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.534
See you there?
Yes.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.162
Henry, I gotta fly before
Stark has an aneurysm

07:42.253 --> 07:44.915
because we're
being way overpaid to
pinch-hit on this project.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.798
But listen, if you can
help us crack it,

07:47.842 --> 07:50.504
there's a very expensive
bottle of Scotch
in it for you.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.711
A very expensive
bottle of Scotch.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.886
Done.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.298
Excuse me. I don't
mean to be a hardass,

07:56.393 --> 07:59.806
but blocking
a police vehicle,
not a very good idea.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.312

I'll get right on it.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.564

Jason has more patents than
the Fortune 500 combined.

at him just to rub up
against their blackboards.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.164
What about his wife?
Amazing.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.878
Amazing scientist.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.295
No, I meant, what about
his wife and you?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.676

There's a breakdown
when the protective field

tries to cross-convert
thermal and kinetic energy.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.625
That's exactly right.

this still could save
thousands of lives.

Police, firemen...

on insurgent strongholds
right now.

produce results.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.354
I get paid regardless.

let me down.

the feedback loop.

I'm not going to start now.

who's gonna make
the coffee?

All right, insert tab epsilon
into slot gamma.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.688
Okay.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.897

make my costumes.

I didn't have childhood dreams
of becoming a commando.

being told to break a leg,
to actually breaking them.

you think, Sheriff.

is that you're doing 60

You saved us again.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.073
You and Henry
laid it all out.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.584
You solved the

I took my ticket book
out of the car for a reason.

Was this on the way
to or from Zoe's school?

Oh, no. She's gonna kill me.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.489
She's right to kill me.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.703
Hey, Jack...
Henry, I wanted to ask
you about losing time.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.956
...have you gotten
any reports on anybody
who's lost time?

18:10.214 --> 18:11.750
So 10 minutes?

18:11.799 --> 18:15.417
Maybe more.
l was at Global Dynamics,
so it could be Section Five.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.676
No. No, lwas out
by the farm.

with a new costume.

ever do it again.

a meal for Jason today.

are you gonna go?

suspended the Sheriff.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.209

or did I?

25:55.304 --> 25:57.044
Look, if we were
meant to be together,

25:57.139 --> 25:58.299
you wouldn't have
wound up with Jason.

that went on too long,

26:03.353 --> 26:04.604

26:05.481 --> 26:11.727
I'm just grateful
that we were able to
salvage our friendship.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.562
Did we ever even kiss?

26:16.909 --> 26:20.367
Couldn't have been
that great a kiss
if you have to ask.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.916
I thought you
were suspended.
You worried to see me?

26:24.958 --> 26:26.823
You shot my friend,
so yes.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.659
I figured it all out.
I know what you're up to.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.415
In regards to?
I know you have a device

26:30.506 --> 26:35.045
that can create a
wormhole, or bend time
or make you invisible.

26:35.094 --> 26:39.838
A wormholing, time-bending,
invisibling device that
shields you from the mind.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.678
Yes. He said invisibling.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.431
No!
ALLISON: Carter!

26:47.523 --> 26:48.763
You're already
under suspension.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.688
Carter! Stop it!
Why are you doing this?

26:50.776 --> 26:52.437
There. That's the device
that invades your mind.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.393
It also starts my car.

Okay, just let go of him.
Get out of here while you can.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.027
Go!

do to get fired, shoot
another innocent person?

27:04.373 --> 27:05.783
Good question. Allison?

27:05.833 --> 27:07.994
Okay, you guys do yourjob.
I'll do mine.

It's a little unorthodox,
but I've dealt with worse.

l'm small, but I'm scrappy.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.343
I don't need therapy.

Maybe not, but
if it keeps you away
from Jason Anderson

27:30.107 --> 27:34.476
until after the DOD.
test this afternoon,
consider it time well spent.

Carter.

if you need anything.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.753
Well, I've had resistant
patients, but you've set
a new benchmark.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.922
I don't have time for this.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.168
I understand
Henry's doing well?

28:00.262 --> 28:03.595
Well, yeah, aside from
the bullet hole, yeah,
he's doing great.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.468
How do you feel
about what happened?

28:05.517 --> 28:07.053
I don't know what happened.

28:07.144 --> 28:10.227
I mean, I was trying
to find out, but I can't
do that from in here.

28:10.314 --> 28:11.895
Sheriff...
Beverly,

28:12.649 --> 28:16.642
no offense, I really, really
don't want to do this.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.519
| get that.
Okay.

28:18.697 --> 28:22.030
But since we're both here,
we might as well talk
about something.

28:22.075 --> 28:26.660
I mean, who knows,
I might even be helpful
if you let me.

28:28.790 --> 28:29.870
Okay.

28:30.667 --> 28:31.998
All right.

28:33.462 --> 28:38.172
Do you know any way
that someone could make
people forget things?

28:39.718 --> 28:43.552
Hypnotherapy could
potentially be used
to trigger memory loss.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.338
No. Nobody could
hypnotize me that fast.

28:46.391 --> 28:49.383
And it wasn'tjust me,
it was everybody at Cafe Diem.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.973
You'd be surprised
what the true masters can do.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.896
Do you know Jason Anderson?

28:56.860 --> 28:58.566
I've met him in passing.

28:58.612 --> 28:59.727
Yeah.

29:01.031 --> 29:03.022
He and Henry go way back.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.905
I don't trust him.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.497
Do you trust Henry?
Of course.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.994
Then shouldn't you
trust Henry's opinion
of Dr. Anderson?

29:13.085 --> 29:15.747
I don't even know
his opinion of Dr. Anderson.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.588
I should ask him.
That's not exactly
where l was driving.

29:20.634 --> 29:23.091
Well, but we all
get different things
from therapy, right?

29:23.136 --> 29:25.752
I mean, I need to see Henry,
that would help me
in my processing.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.303
That's what you'd recommend,
right?

29:27.391 --> 29:30.474
Under normal circumstances,
yes,but”
Great.

29:30.560 --> 29:32.016
So, I can go?

29:32.396 --> 29:33.806
Absolutely.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.817
In 46 minutes.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.316
Oh.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.403
JASON: Don't wander off
too far. The test is in
a couple of hours.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.197
Not to mention,
that crazy sheriff
is still out there.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.248
He does seem fixated on you.

29:55.294 --> 29:59.287
Yeah, well, he's just trying
to deflect his guilt
over shooting Henry.

29:59.381 --> 30:01.997
Do you think he
intentionally
shot Henry?

30:02.384 --> 30:03.965
Doesn't everyone?

30:04.052 --> 30:06.429
I mean, Kim, come on,
they found this nutjob

30:06.471 --> 30:09.133
standing over our friend
with a smoking gun.

30:09.182 --> 30:11.309
How else do you explain that?

30:11.351 --> 30:12.852
I don't know.

30:14.855 --> 30:19.189
There seem to be an awful lot
of things around here lately
that require an explanation.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.743
Solve it again.
What?

30:35.959 --> 30:38.826
Looking at it,
I know I can do it.
I can solve it.

30:38.879 --> 30:40.915
But I want to watch you
do it again.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.006
What did you do?

30:45.385 --> 30:46.966
Come in here,
bring in some coffee,

30:47.012 --> 30:49.469
see that Henry and I
already solved the problem?

30:49.514 --> 30:54.178
Erase the board, erase us,
and stroll back in here
like it was the first time?

31:00.567 --> 31:02.068
Looking for this?

31:07.157 --> 31:09.022
Something is going on.

31:09.159 --> 31:10.899
There's just too many
weird coincidences

31:10.994 --> 31:13.326
for this to be just
about you losing it.

31:13.372 --> 31:16.956
Last night I had a theory
about your buddy, Jason.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.828
Jason?
Yeah,er”.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.416
That he had a device
of some kind.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.540
Oh, that at least
narrows it down.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.713
Oh, don't you start up.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.089
You know,
a device that could, like,

31:27.177 --> 31:30.715
erase short bursts of time,
or how we perceive them.

31:30.764 --> 31:33.722
Almost like he can make us
forget all about him.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.718
CARTER: What?

31:38.688 --> 31:40.064
Not just about him.

31:40.107 --> 31:43.065
He can make us forget
about whatever he wants.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.684
And that's not crazy?
Not at all.

31:45.737 --> 31:46.977
Jason...

31:48.365 --> 31:51.323
Jason Anderson has a machine
that can wipe out
short-term memory.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.525
How can you be so sure?

31:52.577 --> 31:54.829
Because I built it
20 years ago.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.029
I had a theory that a
properly modulated EM burst

31:57.082 --> 31:59.994
could change the
electrical properties
of your brain cells.

32:00.085 --> 32:03.794
Unbind short-term memory
before they can imprint
as long-term memory.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.256
So you have one, too?
No.

32:05.298 --> 32:09.416
While I was developing it,
with Jason, I could never
get a single test to work.

32:09.469 --> 32:10.925
Not one that you
remember, anyway.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.752
Now I know what
the son of a bitch
has been up to.

32:12.806 --> 32:15.092
Jo, this is Carter.
Look, I may need that
backup we talked about.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.299
Meet me in the
Global Dynamics lobby.

32:17.394 --> 32:20.761
You're not storming into
a test session with one
of the Joint Chiefs.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.892
Jason Anderson has a...
A device.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.023
A device.
Oh, great. You, too?

32:25.110 --> 32:27.066
He can erase
short-term memory.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.272
Why would he do that?

32:28.321 --> 32:30.107
Pull Kim's personnel files,
and Jason's.

32:30.157 --> 32:32.694
All the records
back to college.
That'll show us why.

32:41.793 --> 32:45.536
Make sure those are
armored piercing rounds.
I want the works.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.792
You sure about this?

32:47.841 --> 32:50.048
We tested the force field
six times.

32:50.135 --> 32:53.218
Pentagon sees this,
they're gonna jam us
into production right away.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.967
Good for us,
good for Global Dynamics.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.139
And whose
insane idea was this?

32:59.311 --> 33:01.893
I don't remember.
We were talking...

33:03.773 --> 33:05.149
I think it was mine.

33:05.192 --> 33:06.477
Must be.

33:07.068 --> 33:10.105
Kim is far too sensible
to try something like this.

33:10.655 --> 33:11.986
Good luck.

33:25.295 --> 33:26.375
Here.

33:26.463 --> 33:27.543
(LAUGHS)

33:27.631 --> 33:28.711
Here.

33:31.218 --> 33:32.333
Here.

33:32.719 --> 33:35.256
Oh, and look, here.

33:35.597 --> 33:39.010
All of Jason's breakthroughs
were fields Kim pioneered.

33:39.059 --> 33:41.050
This is Jason Anderson
we're talking about here.

33:41.144 --> 33:43.135
This is your friend, Henry.
I thought he was.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.678
But Kim's the real genius.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.684
He's been stealing
her work for decades.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.016
What about
all the other research
projects he's helped on?

33:49.110 --> 33:52.102
Wait for the team to
make the breakthrough
and then wipe them out.

33:52.197 --> 33:55.439
Cover your tracks
and then ride in
and save the day.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.195
This is monstrous.

33:57.494 --> 33:59.359
Twenty minutes at a time.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.158
How many times do you think?

34:03.208 --> 34:05.039
Kim...
Add it up, Henry.

34:06.002 --> 34:08.869
He took a lot more than
20 minutes of my memory.

34:09.631 --> 34:11.212
He took my life.

34:11.758 --> 34:12.793
I know.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.260
We'll make this right, Kim.

34:14.344 --> 34:15.880
I already have.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.551
No.

34:28.733 --> 34:32.646
Carter,
what are you doing here?
You're under suspension.

34:38.535 --> 34:39.900
We had a...

34:40.662 --> 34:41.947
It was...

34:46.918 --> 34:48.533
It was important.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.415
(SCOFFS)

34:54.467 --> 34:56.924
You might want to
put these on, sir.

34:58.305 --> 35:00.967
MAN: Clear the area
for live ammo test.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.593
(ALARM BLARING)

35:05.770 --> 35:10.434
Okay, would love to stay here
and play with you two all day,
but I have work to do.

35:11.985 --> 35:13.020
Jo?

35:13.695 --> 35:15.777
You have no idea
why I'm here, do you?

35:18.283 --> 35:19.318
Wow.

35:22.329 --> 35:23.569
What...

35:28.793 --> 35:30.329
Hidden camera.

35:32.339 --> 35:34.125
Saw the whole thing.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.806
lnitiate test on my mark.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.684
Three, two, one.

35:55.779 --> 35:56.894
Stop!

35:57.822 --> 35:59.153
CARTER: Don't.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.448
Kim, wait.

36:07.374 --> 36:08.910
Don't. Please.

36:09.209 --> 36:10.665
I am leaving.

36:11.127 --> 36:14.290
I can run and you won't even
know why you should chase me.

36:14.339 --> 36:17.081
You haven't run away
from anything in your life.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.756
How do you know?

36:19.761 --> 36:23.174
I don't... I don't know
anything anymore.

36:25.058 --> 36:26.639
Maybe I cheated on him.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.973
How many times did I
catch Jason cheating on me
and he made it all better?

36:30.021 --> 36:31.056
No.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.346
Maybe I left him.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.683
How many times
did I tell Jason

36:36.778 --> 36:40.111
I'm leaving,
and I walk out that door
and boom, none of it happened?

36:40.198 --> 36:42.564
Whatever he took from you,

36:42.659 --> 36:45.696
from everybody,
is unforgivable.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.906
But you cannot
kill him for it.

36:49.165 --> 36:51.372
Henry, what did he
take from you?

36:54.337 --> 36:59.001
Why can't we remember
if we ever even kissed?

37:00.427 --> 37:02.543
Remember our biggest fight?

37:02.637 --> 37:07.427
Remember when you told Jason
it was okay to ask me out?

37:07.517 --> 37:08.597
Do you?

37:08.685 --> 37:10.801
More than 20 years ago.
I...

37:11.980 --> 37:14.096
We had to move on. I had to.

37:15.108 --> 37:18.976
Henry, if he stole us...

37:28.538 --> 37:30.779
Stark, what's going on?

37:30.874 --> 37:32.614
Someone's about
to lose theirjob.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.415
Nathan, there's something
you should know.

37:34.461 --> 37:36.577
Sheriff, you’re standing
in the way of science.

37:36.671 --> 37:39.788
Jason,
the camera never lies.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.582
My daughter taught me that.

37:42.635 --> 37:45.172
I had Jo rig me up
with this digital video,

37:45.263 --> 37:48.221
and we just
finished watching
the surveillance feed.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.552
We know about your
memory wiper,

37:50.602 --> 37:54.265
which is a device
that Henry built
and you stole.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.308
A memory wiper. Stark,
are you listening to this?

37:56.399 --> 37:58.060
Can you have
this maniac hauled off?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.770
l outsmarted you.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.605
Now I know you're
hallucinating.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.232
Activate the damn test.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.272
I'll get that.
Okay, fair enough.

38:05.325 --> 38:08.613
I mean, you're 100% certain
that you're smarter than me.

38:09.579 --> 38:11.115
Are you smarter than Kim?

38:11.915 --> 38:15.453
I mean, she's the one
that programmed your
very fancy little vest.

38:15.502 --> 38:16.992
I double-checked
the algorithms.

38:17.086 --> 38:20.624
Sure, and if Jason Anderson
is the genius everybody says
he is,

38:20.673 --> 38:24.040
then there's no way
you're in any danger.
But, if Kim's the real genius,

38:24.135 --> 38:26.751
then you have no way
of knowing if she
sabotaged that vest.

38:26.805 --> 38:31.299
But, if you're smarter than
her, then there's no way she
could have figured it out.

38:32.727 --> 38:35.969
If she had a problem,
she would have said something.

38:36.022 --> 38:39.310
Maybe she did, and you
just don't remember it.

38:41.486 --> 38:44.102
There's no way
she'd play you, right?

38:44.155 --> 38:45.895
I mean, you're Jason Anderson.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.823
You're the genius, not her.
So let's fire this puppy up.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.070
No! No!

38:55.041 --> 38:57.157
I think it's time
for you to go, Jason.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.575
Stark, come on.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.661
Cash that check quick.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.999
It's the last one
you're gonna see.

39:04.425 --> 39:06.040
General.
Yes, sir.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.005
How could you do this?

39:20.108 --> 39:22.315
I just wanted what you had.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.185
You and Henry.

39:26.656 --> 39:28.897
Look, I did what I had to do
but I gave you a good life.

39:28.992 --> 39:30.573
No. You took it.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.874
What can I say, Henry?
I'm sorry.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.371
lfl hadn't come when I did...

39:40.420 --> 39:42.376
He would have been fine.

39:44.340 --> 39:48.424
Even though
you stole my life,
I couldn't take yours.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.674
The vest works.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.974
| just turned down the power
so you'd get banged up a bit.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.266
Is that right?

39:57.353 --> 39:58.889
(GRUNTING)

40:12.952 --> 40:14.908
Even I saw that one coming.

40:30.219 --> 40:31.299
KlM: Henry.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.673
Hey. I thought maybe
you'd changed your mind.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.630
No, I had some
thinking to do.

40:35.725 --> 40:37.807
Sure. You know,
a lots happened.

40:37.894 --> 40:39.259
If you don't wanna do this,
I understand.

40:39.354 --> 40:41.561
Stark offered me
a position at CD.

40:41.606 --> 40:42.812
Oh.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.099
Oh.
Yeah.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.276
So I'd stay here in...
Are you...

40:48.321 --> 40:49.561
Considering it?

40:49.614 --> 40:51.479
Yeah.
Well, that's good.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.527
Ah, well, for the town.
I mean, you know,

40:53.618 --> 40:55.950
no question
you'd be an asset.

41:15.431 --> 41:16.762
I remember that.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.799
GIRL: Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.758
A Midsummer Night's Invasion
is about to begin.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.177
(LAUGHING)

41:22.563 --> 41:25.691
Where are my
cybernetic faeries?
Faeries, assemble.

41:25.775 --> 41:26.855
Excuse me.
CARTER: Yeah.

41:26.943 --> 41:28.649
The backstage is for...
Two seconds, two seconds.

41:28.695 --> 41:30.731
Hey. These are for you.
Dad?

41:31.406 --> 41:32.816
l'm psyching up.
I know.

41:32.865 --> 41:36.153
| just wanted you to know
that I'm here, this time.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.406
You're gonna be great.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.999
Break a leg.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.867
Thanks, Dad.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.177
If we shadows have offended,

41:56.264 --> 41:57.845
think but this,
and all is mended,

41:57.890 --> 42:00.552
that you have
but slumbered here

42:00.643 --> 42:02.599
and these visions
did appear.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.561
And, as I am an honest Puck,

42:05.648 --> 42:07.684
if we have unearned luck,

42:08.026 --> 42:10.608
now to escape
the serpent's tongue,

42:10.695 --> 42:12.731
we will make amends ere long.

42:12.822 --> 42:17.236
Else the Puck a liar call,
so, good night unto you all.

42:18.286 --> 42:20.368
Give me your hands,
if we be friends,

42:20.455 --> 42:22.616
and Robin shall
restore amends!

42:27.295 --> 42:28.535
(WHOOPS)

42:30.673 --> 42:34.040
Oh, she was amazing.
And her costume is terrific.

42:36.512 --> 42:39.128
Oh, my God,
all the drama they put
us through as parents,

42:39.223 --> 42:41.430
and these are the moments
we're gonna remember the most.

42:41.517 --> 42:42.893
If we're lucky.

42:43.770 --> 42:46.352
(WHOOPING)
