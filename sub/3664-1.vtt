00:49.817 --> 00:52.024
Name Gan-nan.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.380
Wanted on charged of kidnapping,

00:57.425 --> 00:59.132
blackmail and murder.

01:02.530 --> 01:06.155
Bounty expiration in ten days.
Bounty amount...

01:06.200 --> 01:07.611
500 nyang!

01:22.817 --> 01:25.474
Easy money! What do you
win for a correct guess?

01:25.519 --> 01:27.154
How much... Double...

01:27.200 --> 01:31.981
Get this one right and you
won't need to plow next year.

01:32.026 --> 01:34.734
Here we go. Place your bets!

01:37.300 --> 01:39.000
Aren't you going to bet?

01:39.100 --> 01:40.356
I should, shouldn't I?

01:40.401 --> 01:43.959
Which one should I go for?

01:44.004 --> 01:46.962
What do you think?
I can't tell you that!

01:47.007 --> 01:49.665
What do you think?

01:49.710 --> 01:52.868
Quit stalling and make your bets.

01:52.913 --> 01:56.872
No, I shouldn't...

01:56.917 --> 01:58.419
Right, Gan-nan?

02:00.421 --> 02:01.977
Surprised?

02:02.022 --> 02:04.935
You idiot, witch!

02:08.128 --> 02:09.631
Let's not create a scene.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.202
Hold it.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.661
Long time no see, Jin-OK.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.263
Don't bother with hello's.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.366
How you been, darling?

02:24.411 --> 02:27.069
You've got to be kidding me.

02:27.114 --> 02:30.573
I don't want any trouble.
Just go your way.

02:30.618 --> 02:33.976
You got to share good things

02:34.021 --> 02:36.779
or none of us can have it.

02:36.824 --> 02:41.484
Think it over. 1,000
nyang is a lot of money.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.185
What?

02:43.230 --> 02:45.488
It's not 500 nyang?

02:45.533 --> 02:48.457
Do I look like a 500 to you?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.960
Your beloved master
must have kept some for himself.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.863
And not only 100
nyang or 200 nyang,

02:53.908 --> 02:56.013
<i>but a whole 500 nyang?</i>

02:57.912 --> 02:59.869
He's getting away.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.621
Get him...

03:08.022 --> 03:10.525
Hey, Gan-nan. Get him!

03:17.800 --> 03:18.906
Hop on. What?

03:18.952 --> 03:21.845
If you want to live, hop on.

03:21.902 --> 03:22.958
What did you say?

03:23.003 --> 03:25.415
What are you, a deaf?

03:38.118 --> 03:39.825
What the heck is that?

03:46.227 --> 03:48.184
Shall we start? That's cute.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.485
<i>What the...</i>

03:49.530 --> 03:50.736
Get that witch...

04:04.311 --> 04:06.120
All attack!

04:22.930 --> 04:24.987
<i>Idiots...</i>

04:25.032 --> 04:26.511
Surround her!

04:28.702 --> 04:31.060
Ga-bi!

04:31.105 --> 04:33.162
Over here.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.311
Wave!

05:15.416 --> 05:17.919
Get her...

05:30.931 --> 05:32.855
Don't panic.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.902
Everybody, stay calm.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.818
Get ready.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.620
Here she comes.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.472
Adios for now.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.075
Have a good day.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.531
What?

05:57.424 --> 06:01.429
Don't miss this one
for the sake of Jin-OK.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.820
"THE HUNTRESSES"

06:54.900 --> 06:55.900
Come here, you.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.500
I said I was sorry.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.406
It won't happen
again, all right?

06:59.452 --> 07:01.877
Well, it's happened
too many time already.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.347
Where's the other 500 nyang?

07:03.393 --> 07:05.180
Ga-bi, will you calm her down?

07:05.225 --> 07:06.682
She has the crazy eyes again.

07:06.727 --> 07:10.085
It's not her eyes. She's
just plain psychotic.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.087
Give her the money
before she kills you.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.057
Hey, you're not helping.
Give me the money, now!

07:15.102 --> 07:17.412
Gather up, everyone...

07:19.006 --> 07:20.562
This is something
serious, isn't it?

07:20.607 --> 07:22.264
Definitely something dangerous.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.966
I'd better be going then.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.321
It's nothing like that.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.875
That's just a bearing ball.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.920
A bearing ball?

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
Only that it isn't an
any old bearing ball.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.282
It's an any old bearing ball...

07:40.327 --> 07:41.635
Oh, come on!

07:59.813 --> 08:02.070
It's just a waterwheel.

08:02.115 --> 08:04.220
Or is it?

08:08.900 --> 08:12.900
Are you in trouble again?
Let go of this and tell me.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.028
Where are you?
Turn the light back on.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.787
Anyone tries to infiltrate,

08:18.832 --> 08:21.056
and these walls will come down.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.758
That can withstand arrows,

08:22.803 --> 08:25.461
matchlocks and most artilleries.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.863
That's my girl. Well done!

08:27.908 --> 08:30.966
I feel so much safer now.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.067
Stop it.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.186
Okay... let's go out for lunch.

08:34.232 --> 08:36.624
It feels quite
claustrophobic in here.

08:36.669 --> 08:37.972
Put them back up.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.913
I need to go about
an urgent matter.

08:40.958 --> 08:42.477
To hit the can?

08:42.523 --> 08:46.782
Come on.
The girl says she has to go.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.784
I haven't installed an
opening mechanism yet.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.239
Does that mean we can't get out?

08:51.285 --> 08:53.730
We could open it manually.

08:53.776 --> 08:55.202
This will keep us safe?

08:55.248 --> 08:57.559
You're the biggest hazard to us.

08:57.604 --> 08:59.761
Come on, let's get us out of here.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.406
One, two, three!

09:02.500 --> 09:04.000
Can you make some effort?

09:04.100 --> 09:05.300
Was it 'on' three?

09:05.400 --> 09:06.400
No, it's after three.

09:06.532 --> 09:08.532
But he says it's on three.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.100
Nobody lifts on three!

09:10.146 --> 09:12.289
Whether it's 'on'
three or 'after'...

09:12.334 --> 09:14.645
you got to put in
some muscle power.

09:14.700 --> 09:17.200
It doesn't matter if
you count till 100.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.981
Come on, everyone!
After three, then.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.782
All right.

09:20.827 --> 09:23.085
<i>One, two...</i>

09:23.130 --> 09:24.632
Three!

09:25.100 --> 09:27.100
Darn it! Get out of the way.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.958
This darn hole of a house!

09:30.003 --> 09:31.159
Easy! You'll hurt yourself.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.411
Yeah, just tear it all
down this old house.

09:57.831 --> 10:02.803
You must get to His Majesty...

10:36.103 --> 10:38.060
There is another one.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.105
Find him!

10:39.200 --> 10:40.201
Yes, sir...

10:48.215 --> 10:50.772
Did you retrieve the stauroscope?

10:50.817 --> 10:54.276
It had already left him by
the time we got to him.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.579
There was another secret envoy?

10:57.624 --> 10:59.934
We chased the other one but...

11:01.628 --> 11:03.585
Apologies, my lord.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.487
I won't hear of it.

11:05.532 --> 11:10.158
Bring me the
stauroscope at all cost.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.862
You must repay my kindness.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.820
Isn't that right, SA-hyeon?

11:18.100 --> 11:21.588
The number of secret envoys
assassinated to date is seven.

11:21.634 --> 11:24.020
They were all killed
just a day before...

11:24.065 --> 11:26.245
they were due to
meet His Majesty.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.778
The only one surviving is Gong-GU.

11:29.823 --> 11:33.582
I'm afraid the stauroscope
will be lost forever.

11:33.627 --> 11:38.627
We can't just sit around
and wait for him to show.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.756
We mush look for him ourselves.

11:40.801 --> 11:44.806
But since we cannot ascertain
who's colluding with the enemies,

11:45.005 --> 11:50.005
the risk is far too
great to use our men.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.868
I have a proposition.

11:52.913 --> 11:56.918
Have you heard of a
man called Mu Myeong?

12:00.120 --> 12:05.080
I hear that you are responsible
for 60% of all successful bounties.

12:05.125 --> 12:09.584
You heard wrong, sir. It's 70%.

12:09.629 --> 12:13.509
His name is Gong-GU.
A bandit leader.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.159
What are you doing?

12:17.204 --> 12:20.262
Having fun eavesdropping?

12:20.307 --> 12:22.913
This is how you do it.

12:23.500 --> 12:27.200
He has tattooed 'Number 9'
in Chinese character of the neck.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.771
So, you want me to find this man?

12:29.816 --> 12:33.075
He also has an article
in his possession,

12:33.120 --> 12:35.477
a thing called stauroscope.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.679
I want the stauroscope, too.

12:37.724 --> 12:41.183
I expect utmost discretion.

12:41.228 --> 12:44.141
The bounty at stake
is 10,000 nyang.

12:47.601 --> 12:48.957
I won't take the job.

12:49.002 --> 12:52.006
Why not?

12:54.908 --> 12:57.218
Sorry about that.

13:03.717 --> 13:08.717
Come out, Constable Song...

13:11.224 --> 13:12.380
Sir!

13:12.425 --> 13:14.234
What the heck?

13:16.129 --> 13:19.354
They'll soon be out
looking for Gong-GU.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.157
Follow their every move.

13:22.202 --> 13:27.162
Sir, I shall fulfill my duties
as a honorable constable.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.563
Good.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.610
Now, return to your post.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.223
Yes, sir.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.186
Great! I'm out for some air,

13:51.231 --> 13:53.955
and it starts to rain.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.659
I think it's quite lovely.

13:57.704 --> 14:00.462
Lovely?

14:00.507 --> 14:05.167
You obviously never had
your washing soaked in rain before.

14:05.212 --> 14:09.070
You brought it upon yourself
when you got married early.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.572
I know!

14:10.617 --> 14:15.076
You girls stick it out as
long as you can. You hear?

14:15.121 --> 14:18.180
By the way, hasn't your husband
enter into the society yet?

14:18.225 --> 14:20.782
Thanks to his incompetence,

14:20.827 --> 14:24.486
I'm getting all the scolding
from my mother-in-law.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.155
Why don't you make sure
she doesn't say another word?

14:27.200 --> 14:30.659
I could beat her up for
you, if you'd like.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.261
My goodness, the way you talk...

14:33.306 --> 14:34.542
Reminds you of her?

14:34.588 --> 14:36.364
Makes me want to puke.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.320
Oh, Lord!

14:43.917 --> 14:47.576
What? Book of Secret Recipes?

14:47.621 --> 14:52.080
So, you'll restore the family
fortune with lowly cooking skills?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.682
You wicked witch!

14:53.727 --> 14:55.483
How can you drag your husband

14:55.528 --> 14:59.454
into doing lowly women's job?

14:59.499 --> 15:02.757
Mother, I never did such a thing.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.060
And, whether lowly or not,

15:05.105 --> 15:06.862
it's what he chooses to do.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.464
Isn't that what matters?

15:09.509 --> 15:10.966
Stop, madam.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.868
You mustn't talk like that.

15:12.913 --> 15:16.872
How dare you talk back to me,

15:16.917 --> 15:19.374
you silly lowly girl!

15:19.419 --> 15:21.376
A lowly girl?

15:21.421 --> 15:23.678
Aren't you a woman yourself?

15:23.723 --> 15:27.728
What about your
mother and her mother?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.184
And guess what?

15:29.229 --> 15:31.887
Your dearly treasured son,

15:31.932 --> 15:34.055
was given birth by you, a woman!

15:34.100 --> 15:35.357
Good heavens...

15:35.402 --> 15:37.459
Mother!

15:37.504 --> 15:41.263
This is why they say you must

15:41.308 --> 15:44.414
find a wife from good roots.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.700
Get out of my house now!

15:48.800 --> 15:49.800
Mother!

15:49.900 --> 15:53.600
Who are you calling a mother?
Leave this house at once!

15:53.700 --> 15:55.200
Hong-Dan!

15:56.723 --> 15:58.480
Good afternoon, madam.

15:58.525 --> 16:02.029
<i>I'm a friend Hong-dan's.</i>

16:04.230 --> 16:07.255
This mirror is from Qing China.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.057
And this hairpin...

16:09.102 --> 16:10.959
Let me guess. From Vietnam?

16:11.004 --> 16:12.060
Or Samra?

16:12.105 --> 16:16.110
Samra is the correct answer.

16:16.209 --> 16:19.868
What did you want to see
my daughter-in-law for?

16:19.913 --> 16:22.871
You haven't told your mother yet?

16:22.916 --> 16:25.073
Tell her what?

16:25.118 --> 16:28.877
First of all,
show her the hairpins.

16:28.922 --> 16:29.922
My hairpins?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.400
What are you trying to do?

16:32.500 --> 16:36.915
It's okay. Just show her.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.011
Oh, dear...

16:48.008 --> 16:50.614
What in God's name are you doing?

17:07.926 --> 17:09.784
Here. Have a drink.

17:09.829 --> 17:13.402
Now, this is your
daughter-in-law's specialty.

17:25.712 --> 17:30.572
Isn't it delightful to see
what she is capable of?

17:30.617 --> 17:32.874
Sure... I ask of you

17:32.919 --> 17:36.378
to give her good guidance.

17:36.423 --> 17:42.135
Please don't...

17:45.331 --> 17:47.155
One poster per person

17:47.200 --> 17:49.858
and one bundle of coins each.

17:49.903 --> 17:53.661
Now listen carefully.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.663
<i>Okay...</i>

17:55.708 --> 17:57.665
As you see in the poster,

17:57.710 --> 17:59.768
the wanted man's name is Gong-GU.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.669
Gong-GU... That's right.

18:01.714 --> 18:05.373
He has a tattoo on
the back of the neck.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.075
Listen.

18:07.120 --> 18:12.120
'Gu' like number 9, not like mouth.

18:12.225 --> 18:15.035
Gu like number 9.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.803
Number 9 in the back of the
neck, it is.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.962
Did you really find out
where Gong-gu is hiding out?

18:28.007 --> 18:29.364
That's right.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.766
Way to go, girl!

18:31.811 --> 18:35.816
You're better off
without the master who rips us off.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.683
Where did they go?

18:48.728 --> 18:49.776
You! Who are you?

18:49.822 --> 18:51.686
Why are you following us?

18:51.731 --> 18:53.755
You could see me? Who are you?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.457
Who the heck? Your identity.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.358
I can't be visible.

18:57.403 --> 18:58.695
You've been following us.

18:58.741 --> 19:00.762
Why did you follow us?
The reason!

19:00.807 --> 19:03.364
Do you practice that?

19:03.409 --> 19:08.415
Taking turns to talk like that?

19:10.116 --> 19:14.075
Fine! I'll tell you.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.377
Where do I start...

19:16.422 --> 19:18.756
Have you heard of the
Department of Seoul?

19:18.802 --> 19:20.982
In that department,
my duty is to...

19:21.027 --> 19:23.084
Take care of him, will ya?

19:23.129 --> 19:24.886
We got to move on.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.055
Just bury him somewhere.
I'm hungry.

19:27.100 --> 19:31.059
All right.
Order a beef stew for me.

19:31.104 --> 19:32.961
Who do you think you are?

19:33.006 --> 19:34.815
You asked me a question...

19:37.810 --> 19:42.810
Why are you looking
at me like that?

19:43.416 --> 19:46.774
What a curious joker!

19:46.819 --> 19:48.276
You clueless witches!

19:48.321 --> 19:50.631
How dare you,
in presence of a man...

19:59.799 --> 20:02.957
You know how to punch for a girl.

20:03.002 --> 20:06.609
Hey, come back here.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.818
Hey! Slow down.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.919
<i>You... What?</i>

20:20.820 --> 20:25.530
I knew it. You're not a woman.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.675
Go home.

20:38.721 --> 20:42.245
If you follow us again,
I'll kill you for real.

20:42.300 --> 20:45.110
<i>Okay...</i>

20:48.414 --> 20:53.414
It feels different to hit this one.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.822
How curious!

21:12.805 --> 21:15.217
There you are.
Who are you people?

21:19.912 --> 21:22.470
Where are the girls?

21:22.515 --> 21:25.273
What you doing in my house
without my permission?

21:25.318 --> 21:27.175
I hear you're looking for this man.

21:27.220 --> 21:29.077
Where is the girls now?

21:29.122 --> 21:31.124
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:33.326 --> 21:34.572
Where did the girls go?

21:34.618 --> 21:36.684
What...
what if I don't tell you?

21:36.729 --> 21:38.586
Are you going to kill me?

21:38.631 --> 21:41.305
Not until you tell me.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.682
Who are you to
talk to me this way?

21:43.728 --> 21:45.545
You see the wick burning?

21:45.605 --> 21:48.263
It never goes off once it's lit.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.375
So, unless you want to
meet your fate here...

21:51.421 --> 21:53.753
That's not supposed to happen.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.273
God...

21:58.318 --> 22:00.675
I ask for the last time.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.478
Where are the girls?

22:03.523 --> 22:06.481
They went to the market
because it's a market day.

22:06.526 --> 22:09.439
Girls like markets, don't they all?

22:16.002 --> 22:17.759
So? Is he there?

22:17.804 --> 22:21.362
They all look alike. It's
hard to tell from a poster.

22:21.407 --> 22:24.265
It's not easy to single out

22:24.310 --> 22:26.868
someone you've never met.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.771
What do we do now?
What do you mean, what?

22:29.816 --> 22:31.523
Gather around.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.530
Attention, please!

22:42.328 --> 22:43.885
His name is Gong-gu.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.186
Gu, not like 'mouth'

22:45.231 --> 22:48.656
but like 'number 9' tattooed
in the back of the neck.

22:48.701 --> 22:52.360
Raise your hand, if you think
you're the man I'm looking for.

22:52.405 --> 22:57.411
Come on, a little cooperation here?

22:59.312 --> 23:00.968
Gong-gu!

23:01.013 --> 23:03.220
You're Mr. Gong-gu, right?

23:05.118 --> 23:07.175
Follow us quietly.

23:07.220 --> 23:09.577
Who sent you?

23:09.622 --> 23:11.079
Was it Kim Ja-heon?

23:11.124 --> 23:12.180
Who?

23:12.225 --> 23:15.683
It doesn't matter who.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.685
If you want to take me away,

23:17.730 --> 23:18.953
you'll have to kill me.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.356
Hello, you sneaky rat!

23:21.401 --> 23:26.612
You were lucky to get away
last time but not today.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.065
Who the heck are you?

23:31.110 --> 23:32.667
Hello, pretty-face!

23:32.712 --> 23:34.969
Which house you from?

23:35.014 --> 23:36.070
What?

23:36.115 --> 23:39.273
Which whorehouse you work for?

23:39.318 --> 23:41.075
<i>What the...</i>

23:41.120 --> 23:42.777
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.222
Walk away.

23:44.300 --> 23:45.300
What the heck?

23:45.425 --> 23:47.281
What's wrong with that one-eye?

23:47.326 --> 23:49.684
What did you call me,

23:49.729 --> 23:52.335
you clueless little witch?

23:54.100 --> 23:56.257
Hey, we can always talk things out.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.359
You weren't sent by Kim Ja-heon?

23:58.404 --> 24:01.562
We're here at the request
of the Chief of Police.

24:01.607 --> 24:04.465
The Chief of Police?

24:04.510 --> 24:07.218
Why didn't you say so?

24:09.415 --> 24:10.471
<i>What the...</i>

24:10.516 --> 24:12.774
Gosh, I'm missing a tooth.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.675
Ready?

24:14.720 --> 24:16.377
Why are you doing?

24:16.422 --> 24:18.333
Get that man!

24:31.003 --> 24:33.161
Get those witches!

24:33.206 --> 24:35.015
You heard him.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.100
This is going to be a mess.

24:39.212 --> 24:42.069
Mr. Gong-gu,
you must stay close to me.

24:42.114 --> 24:43.271
Okay.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.227
Don't stand behind me.

24:48.921 --> 24:51.379
This isn't going to work.

24:51.424 --> 24:52.780
Let's split and meet back.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.982
Meet back where?

24:55.027 --> 24:56.938
Just split first!

25:22.522 --> 25:24.627
Bring it on, scumbags!

25:37.603 --> 25:40.015
Stay behind me! Behind me!

25:46.913 --> 25:49.270
Back off! Didn't you hear me?

25:49.315 --> 25:50.972
What are you doing there?

25:51.017 --> 25:52.073
Do something.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.075
What could I do? Jump!

25:54.120 --> 25:55.724
What?

26:03.829 --> 26:04.933
Jump?

26:07.800 --> 26:09.757
I can make it.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.959
I can make the jump.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.006
I made it...

26:18.210 --> 26:20.210
Darn it, I broke it.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.960
Jin-OK!

26:46.005 --> 26:49.418
Ga-bi! Hong-Dan...

27:05.324 --> 27:07.133
Search for them.

27:53.906 --> 27:55.817
Freeze.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.067
Don't make a move

28:00.112 --> 28:04.672
or I'll blow your head off.

28:04.717 --> 28:07.375
I said not a move.

28:07.420 --> 28:09.276
Tell me.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.427
Why did you kill Gong-gu?

28:17.329 --> 28:19.954
Turn around and face me.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.206
Look at me.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.812
Let me go!

28:37.316 --> 28:39.523
Go, miss! Hurry!

29:30.202 --> 29:34.061
The King is such a reckless man.

29:34.106 --> 29:38.365
He tried to build the military map

29:38.410 --> 29:42.415
of the Great Qing Emperor's army?

29:43.916 --> 29:47.875
All I have to do is to hand over
this stauroscope to the Qing envoy

29:47.920 --> 29:51.925
and this kingdom will be mine.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.459
Has it been 10 years?

30:38.504 --> 30:42.863
No, it's been more.

30:42.908 --> 30:50.622
Stay alive a little longer.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.378
Nothing can go happen

30:57.423 --> 31:00.080
until the Qing envoys arrive.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.282
Yes, my lord.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.284
The only worry is

31:03.329 --> 31:05.753
that he might try to
kill himself again.

31:05.798 --> 31:11.111
Keep reminding him that
we're holding his daughter hostage.

31:13.005 --> 31:18.005
That's the only way
to keep him alive.

31:18.611 --> 31:23.822
You can never let him die.

31:29.922 --> 31:33.581
It all happened because of
me, master.

31:33.626 --> 31:34.782
Please punish me.

31:34.827 --> 31:38.185
She's right.
If it wasn't for her...

31:38.230 --> 31:39.753
But it's true.

31:39.798 --> 31:44.258
I'll take any
punishment you give me.

31:44.303 --> 31:48.308
But before that,
tell me who Gong-gu was.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.664
How am I supposed to know that?

31:50.709 --> 31:52.366
I don't know him.

31:52.411 --> 31:56.070
You've been tracking his trail.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.715
I was there that day.

31:58.800 --> 31:59.800
You were?

31:59.879 --> 32:02.576
How I come I never saw you?

32:02.621 --> 32:05.179
You weren't trying to keep
whole 10,000 nyang to yourself?

32:05.224 --> 32:07.581
I don't think so.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.383
It's not like that at all.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.986
It really doesn't concern you.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.631
You got to believe me.

32:13.700 --> 32:14.700
Liar. Crook.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.200
It's a habit.
Like he always has done.

32:17.286 --> 32:19.560
How dare you rebel
against your honored master?

32:19.605 --> 32:23.610
We tried to do good
and ended up losing all the money.

32:23.709 --> 32:27.170
I know nothing about it.

32:27.216 --> 32:32.072
He leaves me with no choice.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.376
Get me my sword. Your sword?

32:35.421 --> 32:40.281
I really wasn't going to tell you
but I will just once.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.883
So, listen carefully.
And no questions.

32:42.928 --> 32:43.984
Okay.

32:44.029 --> 32:46.353
You remember about

32:46.398 --> 32:51.398
the war between this country
and the Qing Dynasty.

32:51.503 --> 32:52.960
As the result of defeat,

32:53.005 --> 32:56.163
our Crown Prince was
taken hostage by Qing.

32:56.208 --> 32:59.967
This country! The humiliation!

33:00.012 --> 33:02.670
And 10 years on...

33:02.715 --> 33:05.072
The Prince! The King!

33:05.117 --> 33:06.774
The expedition to
conquer the north!

33:06.819 --> 33:09.576
Sir Gong-gu was at
the center of it all.

33:09.621 --> 33:12.579
And that stauroscope
was the vital basis.

33:12.624 --> 33:15.482
So, the King tried... but failed.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.585
And it all ended up like this.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.610
Do you understand?

33:23.002 --> 33:26.160
You don't understand?
Should I explain again?

33:26.205 --> 33:27.361
Long time ago...

33:27.406 --> 33:30.731
So, Gong-gu was
King's secret envoy

33:30.777 --> 33:35.841
and his mission was to pass
the stauroscope to the King.

33:35.887 --> 33:38.619
But we had no idea
what was going on.

33:38.665 --> 33:41.709
We just had to find
the man and get...

33:41.754 --> 33:43.948
the reward from the
Chief of Police.

33:43.994 --> 33:46.259
Then, the one-eye's
men attacked us and...

33:46.304 --> 33:48.555
the man from the
reeds field showed...

33:48.600 --> 33:50.919
up from out of nowhere
and Gong-gu was...

33:50.964 --> 33:53.023
killed in the
middle of all that.

33:53.069 --> 33:55.756
They took the
stauroscope from me.

33:55.801 --> 33:59.159
So, we can't get our reward
and ended up in this situation.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.115
That's it?

34:12.100 --> 34:15.199
Murderers, surrender now.
Come out to be bound.

34:15.300 --> 34:16.300
Murderers? Us?

34:16.400 --> 34:18.600
They're accusing us
of killing Sir Gong-gu.

34:18.699 --> 34:19.900
But it wasn't us!

34:20.023 --> 34:22.501
It was the man that
fought with Jin-OK.

34:22.547 --> 34:23.884
Who would believe that?

34:23.929 --> 34:26.728
Looks like we're going down for it.

34:33.405 --> 34:34.713
<i>Shoot!</i>

34:42.614 --> 34:43.614
What's that?

34:44.817 --> 34:47.574
This tunnel connects to the river.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.676
That's wonderful!

34:49.721 --> 34:50.721
Wait.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.800
Please stay behind for us.

34:52.900 --> 34:54.300
Let us get away first.

34:54.382 --> 34:56.784
What are you talking about?
We should stick together.

34:56.829 --> 34:58.585
Think about it.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.354
If we run away together,

35:00.399 --> 35:03.457
the troops will
come right after us.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.859
If we get caught by chance,

35:05.904 --> 35:08.562
then, we'll be hanged without
a chance to clear our names.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.712
We can't let that happen...

35:19.218 --> 35:21.175
Master. Yes, Ga-bi.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.325
I think I should go.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.982
Hong-Dan!

35:29.027 --> 35:30.184
Hey, Jin-OK...

35:30.229 --> 35:31.833
Yes?

35:34.399 --> 35:37.447
It doesn't feel right to
let you go by yourselves...

35:37.493 --> 35:39.460
Why don't we just go together?

35:39.505 --> 35:40.761
Don't even think about it.

35:40.806 --> 35:44.164
Come on! How can you do this to me?

35:44.209 --> 35:46.366
Wait for us.

35:46.411 --> 35:48.168
I'll do right, I promise.

35:48.213 --> 35:50.170
You're sure?

35:50.215 --> 35:52.072
Long and happy life, master.

35:52.117 --> 35:55.326
Long and happy life...

35:57.823 --> 35:59.928
You ungrateful witches!

36:06.798 --> 36:11.758
Here comes Mu Myeong,
the fearless warrior!

36:11.803 --> 36:14.215
Bring it on if you dare.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.208
<i>Shoot!</i>

36:17.300 --> 36:20.300
Keep shooting at me.
I won't blink an eye.

36:20.412 --> 36:23.570
Keep shooting.
Bring it on, jerks.

36:23.615 --> 36:26.221
Aim for the head!
With arrows like these?

36:43.902 --> 36:47.161
I told you!
It wasn't me but the girls.

36:47.206 --> 36:50.464
Who do you report to?

36:50.509 --> 36:53.667
I'll make you pay
when I get out of here, scumbags!

36:53.712 --> 36:56.318
Is that you, Master Mu Myeong?

36:59.718 --> 37:01.129
Do I know you?

37:02.921 --> 37:05.379
What's wrong with you?

37:05.424 --> 37:06.680
You're asking us?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.582
I'll skin you alive.

37:08.627 --> 37:11.335
Ask Jin-OK. She'll tell you.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.158
Jin-OK! Hong-Dan!

37:18.203 --> 37:20.205
Ga-bi!

37:28.413 --> 37:31.872
Keep an eye on Jo Yu-sik.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.875
He'll come useful very soon.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.579
Yes, my lord.

37:38.624 --> 37:40.581
<i>But...</i>

37:40.626 --> 37:42.983
Why are you keeping him alive

37:43.028 --> 37:46.999
when all the other
envoys are taken out?

37:48.700 --> 37:52.659
The stauroscope the King
had the secret envoys made

37:52.704 --> 37:56.663
contains the military map of Qing.

37:56.708 --> 38:01.708
Even if we take the stauroscope
to the Qing Emperor,

38:01.813 --> 38:05.072
there is nothing the Emperor can do

38:05.117 --> 38:09.122
if we can't prove that our
King commissioned it.

38:09.321 --> 38:14.321
That's why I'm keeping
Jo Yu-sik alive because he lead

38:14.826 --> 38:19.353
and executed the
King's secret mission.

38:19.398 --> 38:24.398
What made you curious about it?

38:26.004 --> 38:29.463
He's been kept in custody
for over 10 years.

38:29.508 --> 38:33.166
I wondered if he is worth all
that trouble, that's all.

38:33.211 --> 38:36.420
Just out of curiosity?

39:12.818 --> 39:14.422
Who's there?

39:31.603 --> 39:33.360
Secret warehouse.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.612
I think we found it.

39:52.524 --> 39:55.182
You can't have imagined
that I would follow you here.

39:55.227 --> 39:58.231
Wherever you go, you're
on the palm of my hand.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.616
Where are they hiding it?

40:18.717 --> 40:22.976
Ga-bi, I found it.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.879
It looks as precious as it's worth.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.232
Let's get out of here.

40:31.329 --> 40:33.900
Hong-Dan, we got it.

40:38.603 --> 40:41.661
What are you doing? Let's go.

40:41.706 --> 40:44.164
Put it back.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.211
Where it was.

40:57.222 --> 40:59.980
Who the heck is that?
Who are you?

41:00.025 --> 41:01.936
Where do you think you're going?

41:04.400 --> 41:05.400
Well... You?

41:05.500 --> 41:06.500
What happened was...

41:06.598 --> 41:08.955
You're really begging to
have your life taken away.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.913
If that's what you want...

41:16.007 --> 41:18.665
I'll take off. Don't be too long.

41:18.710 --> 41:19.966
Sure.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.067
Excuse me...

41:21.112 --> 41:23.114
What the heck?

41:38.600 --> 41:39.600
Jin-OK!

41:39.698 --> 41:40.998
Tell me.

41:41.100 --> 41:42.100
Where is it?

41:42.200 --> 41:44.111
Father!

41:45.704 --> 41:49.463
How dare you?

41:49.508 --> 41:51.064
Get her!

41:51.109 --> 41:52.918
Yes, sir...

41:58.617 --> 42:00.273
What's wrong with you?

42:00.318 --> 42:02.127
Let's get out of here.

42:08.126 --> 42:09.583
Get them!

42:09.628 --> 42:11.785
You can never let them get away.

42:11.830 --> 42:15.107
<i>Get them...</i>

42:23.808 --> 42:26.666
They're coming straight this way.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.268
What are you going to do?

42:28.313 --> 42:31.071
What choice do we have?

42:31.116 --> 42:32.720
Over there.

42:36.922 --> 42:40.680
I know I'll die
early because of her.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.433
Get going. We'll meet back at home.

42:46.197 --> 42:47.554
I'm sorry.

42:47.599 --> 42:49.956
Cut the crap and go.

42:50.001 --> 42:52.208
Be careful, okay?

42:55.807 --> 42:57.364
Hey, you jerks!

42:57.409 --> 42:59.218
Here I am.

43:03.114 --> 43:04.170
You didn't take off?

43:04.215 --> 43:05.772
That's curious.

43:05.817 --> 43:08.875
I don't take off just any time.

43:08.920 --> 43:12.099
Now might be a good time.

43:12.145 --> 43:13.880
Darn it.

43:13.925 --> 43:15.632
Get them.

44:14.519 --> 44:17.777
Tell me the truth
if you wish to live.

44:17.822 --> 44:21.827
Was it Kim Ja-heon that
ordered Gong-gu killed?

44:24.429 --> 44:26.953
Was it Kim Ja-heon?

44:26.998 --> 44:28.955
Answer me.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.658
Master knows nothing of it.

44:31.703 --> 44:33.910
I killed Gong-gu
out of my free will.

44:36.107 --> 44:39.766
Since when was he your master?

44:39.811 --> 44:42.369
SA-hyeon.

44:42.414 --> 44:45.071
Do you know me?

44:45.116 --> 44:46.925
Don't move!

44:49.421 --> 44:52.379
For 10 years,

44:52.424 --> 44:56.429
not a day went by
without remembering that night.

44:58.430 --> 45:03.056
How you stabbed my
father over and over...

45:03.101 --> 45:05.513
I remember clearly.

45:07.505 --> 45:12.511
But I never held
grudge against you.

45:14.713 --> 45:19.924
Because I know that's
how you saved my life.

45:33.998 --> 45:37.002
I appreciate your forgiveness.

45:39.604 --> 45:40.604
<i>But...</i>

45:43.608 --> 45:47.021
I don't know what
you're forgiving me for.

46:53.912 --> 46:56.518
<i>Jin-OK...</i>

46:59.217 --> 47:03.176
Jin-OK, wake up!

47:03.221 --> 47:05.724
What happened to her?

47:16.401 --> 47:18.658
How does it look?

47:18.703 --> 47:20.660
It's a deep cut.

47:20.705 --> 47:22.309
How deep?

47:24.709 --> 47:27.967
How deep?

47:28.012 --> 47:32.017
Very... very deep.

47:32.100 --> 47:34.887
Boil some water and grind
some salt to fine grains.

47:34.933 --> 47:37.459
Light up some charcoal.
Get plenty pine nuts.

47:37.505 --> 47:39.872
Before that,
mix some red lay with water.

47:39.918 --> 47:41.845
You need the clear water on top.

47:41.926 --> 47:43.508
So, don't shake the bowl.

47:43.554 --> 47:46.166
Also,
look for some dandelion and...

47:46.212 --> 47:48.354
Slow down, will you?

47:48.399 --> 47:52.358
Especially at a time like this.

47:52.403 --> 47:54.360
What was it again?

47:54.405 --> 47:56.715
Grind some salt, pine nuts...

48:52.497 --> 48:57.497
I solemnly pledge
under these clouds,

48:57.902 --> 49:01.907
that we shall die
together on the same day.

49:03.308 --> 49:05.164
No, this isn't right.

49:05.209 --> 49:09.214
It has to be more soppy and sweet.

49:12.617 --> 49:14.619
Hey, $a-hyeon!

49:19.424 --> 49:22.282
He's getting more perfect by day.

49:22.327 --> 49:24.484
Gorgeous!

49:24.529 --> 49:28.500
Let's die on the same day.

49:28.599 --> 49:30.010
No, this isn't it.

49:31.002 --> 49:35.762
I solemnly pledge
under these clouds

49:35.807 --> 49:40.366
that my heart for you
will never change.

49:40.411 --> 49:45.371
Even after the clouds drift
away and rocks roll,

49:45.416 --> 49:50.316
I will never forget this promise.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.200
Did you write it all down?

49:52.300 --> 49:53.300
Yes, miss.

49:53.424 --> 49:56.082
Write your name at the bottom.

49:56.127 --> 50:00.701
"SA-hyeon."

50:01.399 --> 50:02.855
And this is for you.

50:02.900 --> 50:05.458
It's a dagger.

50:05.503 --> 50:07.460
I asked my father to have it

50:07.505 --> 50:10.964
made by the top sword maker.

50:11.009 --> 50:13.066
From now, you must use
this beautiful dagger

50:13.111 --> 50:15.268
to protect this beautiful
girl that is me.

50:15.313 --> 50:17.770
Understood?

50:17.815 --> 50:19.272
Pardon? What?

50:19.317 --> 50:21.319
You don't want to?

50:25.823 --> 50:29.482
Give me the names of the envoys
dispatched to Qing.

50:29.527 --> 50:32.285
Will you really have me cut off

50:32.330 --> 50:34.003
your little girl's fingers?

50:36.901 --> 50:38.358
Jin-OK!

50:38.403 --> 50:39.759
Father...

50:39.804 --> 50:43.013
Tell me! Where's the list?

50:52.016 --> 50:54.519
Father!

50:57.922 --> 51:00.980
Run, miss!

51:01.025 --> 51:02.629
Hurry!

51:03.728 --> 51:06.106
You sneaky little rat!

51:13.104 --> 51:15.209
SA-hyeon!

51:41.299 --> 51:45.258
The sworn enemy that
killed my father

51:45.303 --> 51:49.262
and took everything from me

51:49.307 --> 51:51.617
was Kim Ja-heon.

51:53.911 --> 51:58.911
I swore to myself everyday
to have my revenge one day

52:01.719 --> 52:05.678
but when I saw him again,

52:05.723 --> 52:07.532
I froze.

52:10.828 --> 52:14.554
I wasn't able to draw my sword.

52:14.599 --> 52:15.599
Let's go.

52:15.700 --> 52:18.495
And I wondered just
when you would say that.

52:18.541 --> 52:20.359
I can't stand it anymore.

52:20.404 --> 52:23.763
Let's go crush that jerk to pieces.

52:23.808 --> 52:27.517
Crushing or ripping him
apart, go by yourself.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.370
What are you saying?

52:31.415 --> 52:34.521
It's late. Enough for now.

52:53.404 --> 52:55.461
You're the youngest of us.

52:55.506 --> 52:57.432
Yet, you have grown so much.

52:57.478 --> 53:01.767
There must have been times
that you wanted to lean on us.

53:01.812 --> 53:05.817
But we never gave you the
chance to be the baby.

53:07.418 --> 53:09.275
After we finish this job,

53:09.320 --> 53:14.320
I'll be a good big sister.

53:14.525 --> 53:16.630
I'm sorry, Ga-bi.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.357
My poor baby...

53:24.402 --> 53:29.408
Your feet are swollen so badly.

53:33.110 --> 53:35.868
What are you mumbling about?

53:35.913 --> 53:38.671
Who are you? It's Ga-bi.

53:38.716 --> 53:40.873
Then who the heck is this?

53:40.918 --> 53:43.376
Can I get some water?

53:43.421 --> 53:46.747
What's this jerk
doing lying next to me?

53:46.793 --> 53:48.694
You son of a witch!

53:48.740 --> 53:50.383
Have you lost your mind?

53:50.428 --> 53:52.652
Who are you throwing rocks at?

53:52.697 --> 53:54.404
Just go back to sleep.

53:57.301 --> 53:59.358
Are you all right?

53:59.403 --> 54:03.362
That must've hurt.

54:03.407 --> 54:06.465
No biggie. That's just life.

54:06.510 --> 54:11.823
What a sight!

54:13.718 --> 54:15.374
Gosh!

54:15.419 --> 54:17.276
It's my husband's exam day.

54:17.321 --> 54:20.479
I can't believe I totally
forgot about that.

54:20.524 --> 54:24.028
Ga-bi, tell Jin-OK
that I had to go home.

54:26.197 --> 54:28.854
She is really something, isn't she?

54:28.899 --> 54:32.558
Weird witch...

54:32.603 --> 54:34.160
What about me?

54:34.205 --> 54:36.062
What about you?

54:36.107 --> 54:37.663
What do you think of me?

54:37.708 --> 54:41.713
What do you mean what?
You're just pretty.

54:46.517 --> 54:48.174
This isn't...

54:48.219 --> 54:50.876
You know...

54:50.921 --> 54:53.026
You've never done it before?

54:57.628 --> 55:00.905
Come on, do you know how old I am?

55:04.101 --> 55:06.559
No, I've never done it.

55:06.604 --> 55:08.015
What about you?

55:28.326 --> 55:30.283
That felt awesome.

55:30.328 --> 55:32.551
Then, I'll do it again.

55:32.596 --> 55:35.202
Isn't this little too fast?

55:42.807 --> 55:45.765
Who killed Gong-gu, then?

55:45.810 --> 55:48.067
It was Kim Ja-heon.

55:48.112 --> 55:51.971
It was Kim's men that
chased Sir Gong-gu

55:52.016 --> 55:55.474
and assassinated him.

55:55.519 --> 55:59.478
I know because I suffered
under their swords, too.

55:59.523 --> 56:01.881
It's merely a statement,
not an evidence.

56:01.926 --> 56:04.784
If I offer you Gong-gu's
stauroscope as evidence,

56:04.829 --> 56:06.452
will you believe me?

56:06.497 --> 56:08.154
Did you find it?

56:08.199 --> 56:09.199
Without a doubt.

56:09.300 --> 56:12.300
It's not something that should be
kept in anyone's possession.

56:12.400 --> 56:14.100
Hand it over to me.

56:14.200 --> 56:19.700
I will, under one condition.

56:22.813 --> 56:27.819
Is he practicing levitation?

56:29.220 --> 56:31.377
You! Come out.

56:31.422 --> 56:36.182
Mama, I didn't eat it, I swear.

56:36.227 --> 56:38.184
What a character!

56:38.229 --> 56:40.505
Wipe the saliva off your face.

56:45.202 --> 56:47.860
Is this the day that my
head drops to the ground?

56:47.905 --> 56:50.162
How meaningless life is!

56:50.207 --> 56:51.964
Come on! I'm busy.

56:52.009 --> 56:56.802
How can you be so heartless to
someone who is about to die?

56:56.900 --> 56:57.900
What?

56:58.000 --> 57:00.300
Still, I hold no grudge for you.

57:00.418 --> 57:03.275
I have forgiven everyone.

57:03.320 --> 57:04.877
Eventually, it all comes down

57:04.922 --> 57:06.879
to forgiveness and love.

57:06.924 --> 57:10.929
Sure. Be a good man and hurry up.

57:16.100 --> 57:17.563
What's the time anyway?

57:17.609 --> 57:21.060
I'm feeling peckish.
It must be almost meal time.

57:21.105 --> 57:22.661
Get out of there. Come on.

57:22.706 --> 57:25.264
My girls should be
visiting me soon.

57:25.309 --> 57:29.209
I'm sorry but can we
postpone for tomorrow?

57:29.300 --> 57:30.300
It's freezing.

57:30.414 --> 57:33.973
Are you kidding me?
Come on, we haven't got all day.

57:34.018 --> 57:35.929
What's that over there? What?

57:36.700 --> 57:39.671
It wasn't me, okay?
I didn't kill that man.

57:39.717 --> 57:41.900
My girls will clear my name.

57:41.956 --> 57:44.583
Are you trying to get
yourself in a big trouble?

57:44.628 --> 57:45.828
Open this up now.

57:45.900 --> 57:48.470
You'll kill me if I open
it, won't you?

57:48.516 --> 57:49.755
<i>I'm going to...</i>

57:49.800 --> 57:53.058
A royal decree was issued
ordering your release.

57:53.103 --> 57:54.174
Royal decree?

57:54.220 --> 57:56.562
You mean from the King?

57:56.607 --> 57:58.664
Of course,
royal decree is from King.

57:58.709 --> 58:02.668
Who else could issue
a royal decree?

58:02.713 --> 58:05.421
Open this up, now...

58:12.523 --> 58:15.129
Get moving.

58:24.602 --> 58:29.415
It won't be a breeze, this one.

58:31.108 --> 58:33.520
What shall I take this time?

58:38.015 --> 58:40.573
What will you do when
you meet Kim Ja-heon?

58:40.618 --> 58:42.775
I don't know.

58:42.820 --> 58:44.577
I'm thinking.

58:44.622 --> 58:45.778
Still thinking?

58:45.823 --> 58:49.482
Jin-OK, what's this?

58:49.527 --> 58:52.651
What is it? It's soft.

58:52.696 --> 58:54.300
And mushy.

59:16.420 --> 59:19.278
Byeokrando, Joseon's
only international port.

59:19.323 --> 59:21.834
It's an international trade
capital where Chinese,

59:21.879 --> 59:23.983
Japanese,
Westerners even the Moors come.

59:24.028 --> 59:27.999
It's the only territory
outside of Joseon's jurisdiction.

59:55.526 --> 59:58.384
Master, we'll soon be
arriving in Byeokrando.

59:58.429 --> 01:00:00.352
Please ready yourself.

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:02.104
Good.

01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:07.398
Can you stop fidgeting
for crying out loud?

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:12.513
You see that? That's my girls!

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.800
What's that on your back?

01:01:15.906 --> 01:01:18.263
Aren't you a curious, old chap?

01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:20.966
It's a messenger pigeon.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:24.169
I thought they used
falcons for messengers.

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:27.373
Falcons are used by the army.

01:01:27.418 --> 01:01:30.175
We, the police force use
pigeons, okay?

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:31.824
Next!

01:01:32.923 --> 01:01:35.381
What's your business here?

01:01:35.426 --> 01:01:38.784
We are here to fight in the game.

01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:40.152
You're a contender?

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:42.655
What do you mean by that?

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:45.112
What's talking about?

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:50.062
Something doesn't
feel right with you.

01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:52.064
I'm the warrior.

01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:54.214
I'm a fighter of...

01:01:57.114 --> 01:01:58.370
Taekkyeon? That's right!

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:00.572
I'm a Taekkeyon player.

01:02:00.617 --> 01:02:03.075
You see?

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.827
All right.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.455
Name, Maeong Gyo-gak.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:20.505
He is the architect who
designed Kim Ja-heon's pavilion.

01:02:20.704 --> 01:02:24.663
We must find out if he had the
blue print of the pavilion.

01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:26.119
<i>What the...</i>

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:31.870
Look where you're going.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.019
"Blueprint."

01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:36.975
Once Jin-OK confirms the blueprint,

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:39.330
Ga-bi, you got to distract his men.

01:02:40.524 --> 01:02:42.781
Excuse me...

01:02:42.826 --> 01:02:44.983
What about the blueprint?

01:02:45.028 --> 01:02:46.852
I will take care of that!

01:02:46.897 --> 01:02:49.054
You concentrate on your job.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:51.705
I feel dizzy...

01:02:53.103 --> 01:02:56.862
on, I'm dizzy...

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:58.818
There he comes.

01:03:06.717 --> 01:03:09.630
Dizzy... darn it!

01:03:15.726 --> 01:03:18.036
Ga-bi? Ga-bi!

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:11.864
Here.

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:15.167
There are two secret rooms.

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:17.439
One is located on
7th floor of the...

01:05:17.484 --> 01:05:20.272
pavilion and the other
is in the basement.

01:05:20.317 --> 01:05:21.573
Wait... where and where again?

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:23.976
Focus, please?

01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:26.126
It's because I have
water in my ears.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.213
There are two ways to get
to the secret room on the 7th.

01:05:31.259 --> 01:05:33.652
Through the central stairway

01:05:33.697 --> 01:05:36.054
and the ventilation shaft.

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.510
Ventilation shaft?

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:43.212
Ga-bi, you should take
the vent to the top.

01:05:46.009 --> 01:05:47.666
I'll infiltrate
through the iron mill

01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:50.769
to the secret room in the basement.

01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:52.070
What about me?

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:56.120
You take the stairs
up to the 7th floor.

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:18.263
Hey, you!

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.465
Good heavens! You scared me.

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:22.012
Come here.

01:06:27.718 --> 01:06:32.718
Are you the only boys here?

01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:35.080
Yes. Who are you?

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:36.682
I'm Hong-Dan.

01:06:36.727 --> 01:06:39.051
Hong-Dan?

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:40.852
Enemy alert!

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:42.354
Shut up...

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:43.755
I said shut up.

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.805
How many times did I tell you?

01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:15.399
Meeting you made this
journey worthwhile.

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:20.959
Is it true that you have in custody

01:07:21.004 --> 01:07:23.962
the man who stole our military map?

01:07:24.007 --> 01:07:25.063
That's right.

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:27.165
If you can prove.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:31.215
Joseon King's treacherous
plans to the Emperor,

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:35.420
I'll give you Joseon as I promised.

01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:43.782
The gunpowder and
weaponry I brought

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:46.351
will be the gift of proof.

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.754
I shall be looking forward to it.

01:07:48.799 --> 01:07:51.507
So, where is the man?

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:59.513
Qing's envoy has
finally come for you.

01:08:08.819 --> 01:08:12.323
Don't you wish to live?

01:08:20.897 --> 01:08:24.401
Stauroscope, where are you?

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.107
How do you open this?

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:48.380
Good heavens!

01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:53.100
This is how my life
takes a new turn.

01:09:05.207 --> 01:09:09.212
Are you going to throw that at me?

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:14.318
You scared me.

01:09:14.518 --> 01:09:19.524
Ga-bi, I'm rich now.

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:25.649
Look at all these.

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:30.804
I've really become rich.

01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:34.960
Okay, pass...

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:37.462
Who the heck are you?

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.714
Where did the fatty go?

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:47.572
You must win this round.

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:49.426
Sure...

01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:53.733
Because of the darn fatty!

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:58.283
What are you doing?

01:09:58.328 --> 01:09:59.651
I scattered the gunpowder.

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:02.108
So, I'm going to
light up the place.

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:07.808
Who are you trying to fry?

01:10:09.506 --> 01:10:14.506
Stop it!
Don't do it until I've evacuated.

01:10:16.513 --> 01:10:18.515
Send it up in flames.

01:10:20.116 --> 01:10:22.528
Let's light it up and go together.

01:10:25.121 --> 01:10:28.180
Won't you listen to me?

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:31.183
This is my expertise.

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:33.504
Don't you trust me?

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:40.458
I don't.

01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:43.416
Then, that's the end of the story.

01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:53.821
Next is the Joseon's
best Taekkyeon artist.

01:10:55.518 --> 01:10:57.576
What did you say your name was?

01:10:57.621 --> 01:10:58.977
It's Dawn Song.

01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:02.080
Dawn? As in morning,
afternoon and evening?

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:06.444
Show some respect. It's my name!

01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:08.452
Dawn Song!

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:13.959
Place your bets.

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:18.009
They recognize me?
I can't blow my cover.

01:11:22.412 --> 01:11:26.417
You got to be kidding me!

01:11:28.718 --> 01:11:29.983
How old are you?

01:11:30.029 --> 01:11:33.778
This is no place for
a pretty girl like you.

01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:38.283
Do you know how
dangerous this place is?

01:11:38.328 --> 01:11:41.253
Where are your parents?

01:11:41.298 --> 01:11:43.403
Over there. Where?

01:11:51.007 --> 01:11:52.864
Don't be a pussy.

01:11:52.909 --> 01:11:55.321
Get back on your feet.

01:11:57.213 --> 01:11:59.523
Oh, man!

01:12:01.318 --> 01:12:04.822
What's he doing there?

01:12:07.524 --> 01:12:11.283
Are you enjoying the game?

01:12:11.328 --> 01:12:14.052
Yes, it's entertaining.

01:12:14.097 --> 01:12:18.102
But I would rather be meeting
that man right now.

01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:20.859
There's no rush.

01:12:20.904 --> 01:12:23.111
Just sit back and relax.

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:28.667
I said bring him to me.

01:12:28.712 --> 01:12:30.714
Right now!

01:12:34.718 --> 01:12:36.975
Why isn't Jo Yu-sik here yet?

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:39.432
I'll find out, my lord.

01:12:44.327 --> 01:12:47.652
Just do as you're told, okay?

01:12:47.697 --> 01:12:52.557
Tell the Qing envoy
everything you know.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:56.607
And I'll take you to your daughter.

01:12:58.508 --> 01:13:01.466
Let me see my daughter.

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:05.170
Let me see her first.

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:09.174
Damned stubborn man!

01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:12.777
Do you want me to bring her here
and have her head chopped off?

01:13:12.822 --> 01:13:14.779
Is that what you want?

01:13:14.824 --> 01:13:17.532
You'll have your wish
then, Jo Yu-sik!

01:13:19.295 --> 01:13:20.752
Jo Yu-sik.

01:13:20.797 --> 01:13:22.253
What's it going to be?

01:13:22.298 --> 01:13:26.257
Will you confess to the Qing envoy?

01:13:26.302 --> 01:13:29.661
<i>Jin-OK...</i>

01:13:29.706 --> 01:13:34.706
I'll do anything you say.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:38.370
Please don't hurt my daughter.

01:13:38.415 --> 01:13:40.472
Father...

01:13:40.517 --> 01:13:43.375
I beg of you, please.

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:45.923
Father...

01:13:53.897 --> 01:13:55.899
Who are you?

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.906
I asked you a question.

01:14:10.413 --> 01:14:12.620
<i>What the...</i>

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:45.725
Jin-OK, is that really you?

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:50.475
Yes, father.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:56.334
It's your daughter, Jin-OK.

01:15:17.413 --> 01:15:18.413
<i>Jin-OK...</i>

01:15:30.026 --> 01:15:32.597
Yes, father.

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:47.165
You filthy monster!

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:51.169
How can you do this to a man?

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:56.027
I'll do exactly the same to you.

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:07.151
I see that you're not dead.

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:09.254
I had no reason to be.

01:16:09.299 --> 01:16:11.556
You don't need a
particular reason to die.

01:16:11.601 --> 01:16:16.601
I need to know why
you changed like this

01:16:17.407 --> 01:16:19.910
and what happened to my father.

01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:24.168
That man is your father?

01:16:24.213 --> 01:16:29.073
I don't understand and
neither does my father.

01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:30.675
What happened to you?

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:35.720
I said I didn't know
because I don't know you.

01:16:36.526 --> 01:16:41.526
You deny me and
yourself to the end.

01:16:42.799 --> 01:16:49.114
Even so, how is that a
reason that you can't die.

01:17:02.018 --> 01:17:05.329
Why aren't you attacking me?

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.726
Man, this is hard.

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.477
Did you light up the wick?

01:17:39.522 --> 01:17:41.229
Yes.

01:17:42.225 --> 01:17:45.325
It'll give us some time?

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.400
Nope.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.500
Then, when does it blow?

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.600
Now.

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.907
I swear I'll kill you.

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:07.221
My girls caused trouble again.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:15.079
Didn't I tell you be careful?

01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:17.682
Do you want us get killed?

01:18:17.727 --> 01:18:21.698
Well, we're alive.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.805
I swear I'll kill
you with these hands.

01:18:29.505 --> 01:18:31.162
What's going on?

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.563
It's probably nothing.

01:18:32.608 --> 01:18:35.020
Please don't be alarmed.

01:18:38.915 --> 01:18:42.328
Where is SA-hyeon?

01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:11.709
She says she is Jo
Yu-sik's daughter.

01:19:12.615 --> 01:19:17.375
So, that little girl survived.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:21.679
Yes, after enduring
all these years,

01:19:21.724 --> 01:19:24.432
I finally get to see you again.

01:19:28.297 --> 01:19:33.297
This truly is an
ill-fated relationship.

01:19:33.503 --> 01:19:36.461
Don't be so sure.

01:19:36.506 --> 01:19:41.506
Because I'll show what
ill-fated really means.

01:19:45.014 --> 01:19:48.573
You really are the
child of Jo Yu-sik.

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:52.623
But I just don't have time for you.

01:19:52.822 --> 01:19:54.779
Come over here.

01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:59.550
I offer a reward of 1,000
gold coins on her head.

01:19:59.595 --> 01:20:01.052
Kill her!

01:20:01.097 --> 01:20:03.304
Kill her...

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:21.272
Why did you keep her alive?

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:23.674
You did it on purpose?

01:20:23.719 --> 01:20:28.079
I don't understand what you
mean, sir.

01:20:28.124 --> 01:20:33.124
Did the old memories come back?

01:20:34.797 --> 01:20:38.156
I'll keep a eye on you

01:20:38.201 --> 01:20:41.808
see whose dog you really are.

01:20:46.409 --> 01:20:52.121
I almost forgot.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:02.835
I've been meaning
to give this to you.

01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:33.177
Stolen dogs will
bite its new owner,

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:36.280
when it's reunited
with its old master.

01:21:36.325 --> 01:21:38.950
I've had a good use of you

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:41.999
now go back you old master.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.204
Did you get the dagger?

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:26.364
Should Jin-OK ever be in
danger because of me,

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:29.066
you shall stab me with that dagger.

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:34.527
I remember you stabbing
my father over and over.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.778
That will be the
only way to save her.

01:22:40.823 --> 01:22:42.580
Understood?

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:46.004
I don't understand
neither does my father.

01:22:47.396 --> 01:22:48.500
Come on, miss. Hurry!

01:22:52.601 --> 01:22:54.759
SA-hyeon!

01:22:54.804 --> 01:22:58.616
I'm sorry I wasn't
able to protect you.

01:23:17.426 --> 01:23:18.683
Father.

01:23:18.728 --> 01:23:21.552
Look up at the front.

01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:23.804
That's only way you save yourself.

01:24:52.021 --> 01:24:53.523
Father!

01:24:56.525 --> 01:24:58.282
Don't try anything.

01:24:58.327 --> 01:25:00.102
Stand back.

01:25:01.797 --> 01:25:03.504
I said stand back!

01:25:15.711 --> 01:25:19.215
If the walls collapse,
we'll all die.

01:25:20.516 --> 01:25:21.972
We must leave at once.

01:25:22.017 --> 01:25:23.774
What happened to you?

01:25:23.819 --> 01:25:26.077
Are you going to kill your father?

01:25:26.122 --> 01:25:28.124
We got to go now!

01:26:23.913 --> 01:26:26.018
Come on out.

01:27:02.518 --> 01:27:04.429
Stop trying. Get out now.

01:27:06.622 --> 01:27:08.932
I said that's enough.

01:27:12.995 --> 01:27:14.351
Get out of here.

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:17.054
Do you want us both to die here?

01:27:17.099 --> 01:27:19.356
We can both live.

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:21.312
We'll make it out together.

01:27:23.005 --> 01:27:25.663
Listen to me carefully.

01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:28.866
I don't know you.

01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:31.969
I don't know how you
know me from the past

01:27:32.014 --> 01:27:34.471
but I don't know you.

01:27:34.516 --> 01:27:37.725
I remember clearly.

01:27:39.922 --> 01:27:44.922
I can tell when I
look into your eyes.

01:27:46.295 --> 01:27:50.854
So, don't you give up.

01:27:50.899 --> 01:27:52.503
Pull yourself up.

01:27:56.105 --> 01:27:57.962
Get up here.

01:27:58.007 --> 01:28:00.009
Now!

01:28:07.216 --> 01:28:08.820
Hold my hand.

01:28:10.219 --> 01:28:12.426
Hold my hand!

01:28:17.126 --> 01:28:19.606
Come on!

01:28:29.405 --> 01:28:33.410
You must protect me with
this pretty dagger, okay?

01:28:33.609 --> 01:28:35.366
Understand?

01:28:35.411 --> 01:28:39.416
You must keep this promise.

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.329
Hurry LIP-

01:28:48.724 --> 01:28:50.180
What are you doing?

01:28:50.225 --> 01:28:52.449
No!

01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:54.852
You promised me.

01:28:54.897 --> 01:28:58.455
You promised that you'd protect me.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.760
Please, SA-hyeon. Hold my hand.

01:29:02.805 --> 01:29:06.664
Please! Hold my hand.

01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:11.709
It's not in my memories
but that promise I made you...

01:29:11.814 --> 01:29:14.920
I may be able to keep it.

01:29:24.526 --> 01:29:27.507
SA-hyeon!

01:29:33.802 --> 01:29:36.408
SA-hyeon!

01:29:38.407 --> 01:29:40.819
SA-hyeon!

01:30:09.505 --> 01:30:12.816
You're one persistent witch!

01:30:19.515 --> 01:30:21.171
He's getting away.

01:30:21.216 --> 01:30:24.575
Come back here!
Stop right there, you jerk!

01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:26.377
Come back here.

01:30:26.422 --> 01:30:29.631
Catch me if you can.

01:30:34.696 --> 01:30:37.554
What are you going to do?

01:30:37.599 --> 01:30:40.512
What are they trying to do?

01:30:53.215 --> 01:30:56.273
<i>What the...</i>

01:30:56.318 --> 01:30:58.675
Come on, girls! Turn the wheel.

01:30:58.720 --> 01:30:59.720
Turn it...

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.408
What are you doing?

01:31:01.454 --> 01:31:04.245
Shut up and give us a hand.

01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:05.904
This?

01:31:13.101 --> 01:31:14.705
<i>Shoot!</i>

01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:32.976
<i>Shoot!</i>

01:31:33.021 --> 01:31:36.180
Do something or she'll get killed.

01:31:36.225 --> 01:31:38.535
I know that, too.

01:31:39.595 --> 01:31:43.202
Move, fatty!
Is there anything you can do?

01:31:52.708 --> 01:31:54.813
Shoot her.

01:32:12.227 --> 01:32:15.208
What are you doing? Shoot them.

01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:22.159
Come on, turn it.

01:32:22.204 --> 01:32:24.309
It's this way!

01:32:52.601 --> 01:32:56.159
Hong-Dan, hurry...

01:32:56.204 --> 01:32:58.562
All right...

01:32:58.607 --> 01:33:00.814
Come on. Do something.

01:33:10.419 --> 01:33:11.875
Stop...

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.524
Slop?

01:34:16.818 --> 01:34:18.525
Get her!

01:34:24.026 --> 01:34:26.006
I said get her.

01:34:42.411 --> 01:34:44.721
Ga-bi! You did great.

01:34:46.715 --> 01:34:48.972
What did I tell you?

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:51.375
I said I'd never let you get away.

01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:53.577
A lowly stupid girl

01:34:53.622 --> 01:34:55.579
acting fearless
relying on her sword.

01:34:55.624 --> 01:34:59.549
Relying on my sword, did you say?

01:34:59.594 --> 01:35:01.596
All right then.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:09.259
How dare you trying to toy with me?

01:35:09.304 --> 01:35:11.561
You're begging to be killed.

01:35:11.606 --> 01:35:14.364
Should I crush you under my feet

01:35:14.409 --> 01:35:16.821
or shred you to pieces...

01:35:20.916 --> 01:35:23.123
Witch!

01:35:27.022 --> 01:35:29.579
Keep babbling away.

01:35:29.624 --> 01:35:33.595
Suddenly,
you're out of things to say?

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:39.656
Conniving lying wretch like you
doesn't need a mouth.

01:35:39.701 --> 01:35:45.312
From this day, you shall shut that
filthy mouth and live quietly.

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:57.474
You who liaised with the enemies

01:35:57.519 --> 01:35:59.976
and harmed King's
faithful servants.

01:36:00.021 --> 01:36:05.021
Threatened a father with
the life of his child,

01:36:05.694 --> 01:36:09.953
tainted precious memories!

01:36:09.998 --> 01:36:12.308
Lower than lowest of beasts!

01:36:14.002 --> 01:36:16.312
I shall break the hand
that committed terrible deeds.

01:36:18.907 --> 01:36:21.911
I shall crush the leg
that sold out your own country.

01:36:25.113 --> 01:36:30.113
The eyes that look down
on people like animals...

01:36:30.519 --> 01:36:32.521
Save me!

01:36:37.726 --> 01:36:40.206
Show mercy!

01:36:41.997 --> 01:36:49.997
Save me, please...

01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:57.114
Please, I beg you.

01:36:59.314 --> 01:37:02.973
How dare you do this to me?

01:37:03.018 --> 01:37:08.832
I shall do exactly the same to you.

01:37:17.199 --> 01:37:20.657
How does it feel to
hold an empty gun?

01:37:20.702 --> 01:37:22.959
Futile, isn't it?

01:37:23.004 --> 01:37:28.004
That's what the power you
thought you had was like.

01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:32.065
You'd calculate and calculate
again, kill or save people...

01:37:32.110 --> 01:37:36.109
as you see fit but it all
comes down to an empty barrel.

01:37:36.718 --> 01:37:40.723
I'll return the stauroscope
to its rightful owner.

01:38:20.695 --> 01:38:23.107
What is this?

01:38:51.026 --> 01:38:54.599
Where did it go?
I must make report.

01:39:06.908 --> 01:39:08.348
Hey...

01:39:08.394 --> 01:39:12.669
The chief will kill me
if he doesn't hear from me.

01:39:12.714 --> 01:39:13.970
What do I do now?

01:39:14.015 --> 01:39:15.472
Hey, wake up!

01:39:15.517 --> 01:39:17.374
Wakey, pigeon!

01:39:17.419 --> 01:39:19.476
Come on, open your eyes.

01:39:19.521 --> 01:39:22.024
Please! My life depends on you.

01:39:28.496 --> 01:39:30.703
Wake up, please!

01:39:42.711 --> 01:39:46.469
I hear that you performed
a brilliant exploit in Byeokrando.

01:39:46.514 --> 01:39:50.519
I only did what my
duties commanded.

01:39:53.621 --> 01:39:58.621
Faithful servants, you have
saved this country from harm.

01:39:59.794 --> 01:40:04.794
His Majesty wishes to recognize you
for your service.

01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:10.700
Jo Yu-sik, is hereby appointed to
Minister of Defense

01:40:12.307 --> 01:40:15.465
to be in charge of defending
this kingdom from enemies.

01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:20.425
I will fulfill my duties
with honor, Your Majesty.

01:40:23.518 --> 01:40:25.775
As for Mu Myeong...

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:29.825
Please have my master reinstated
upon completion of this mission.

01:40:30.025 --> 01:40:33.996
I hereby restore you to
Chief of Investigation.

01:40:36.498 --> 01:40:37.854
Next is Ahn Hong-Dan...

01:40:37.899 --> 01:40:39.956
Write off her family's debt

01:40:40.001 --> 01:40:44.006
and gift her with a shop for
the family's livelihood.

01:40:45.807 --> 01:40:47.163
Thank you!

01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:49.366
I mean, Your grace is
immeasurable, Your Majesty.

01:40:49.411 --> 01:40:51.368
As for Park Ga-bi...

01:40:51.413 --> 01:40:54.871
She has an exceptional talent in
martial arts and military strategy.

01:40:54.916 --> 01:40:56.973
If you train her academically, too,

01:40:57.018 --> 01:40:59.931
she'll be a great
service to this kingdom.

01:41:08.997 --> 01:41:10.453
That was so uncomfortable.

01:41:10.498 --> 01:41:13.156
His Majesty is such a
handsome man, isn't he?

01:41:13.201 --> 01:41:14.557
How dare you!

01:41:14.602 --> 01:41:15.759
What?

01:41:15.804 --> 01:41:18.069
Who's the leader here?

01:41:18.115 --> 01:41:19.717
Take this.

01:41:19.763 --> 01:41:21.264
What is it?

01:41:21.309 --> 01:41:23.414
Do you know a man called 'Chick'?

01:41:26.915 --> 01:41:28.471
Name, Chick.

01:41:28.516 --> 01:41:32.075
Reward 1,000 nyang.

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:34.477
If you get 1,000
nyang, 500 is mine.

01:41:34.522 --> 01:41:35.678
What?

01:41:35.723 --> 01:41:37.781
You became greedy ever
since you started dating.

01:41:37.826 --> 01:41:40.350
Dating who? Tell me.

01:41:40.395 --> 01:41:43.205
It's not Constable Song, is it?

01:41:44.999 --> 01:41:47.957
Of all the men out there,
you had to pick him?

01:41:48.002 --> 01:41:49.290
What's wrong with that?

01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:51.711
It's between a man and a woman.

01:41:51.757 --> 01:41:53.863
How did you get in here?

01:41:53.908 --> 01:41:56.466
Are you crazy? Don't hit him!

01:41:56.511 --> 01:41:58.616
Whose side are you on?

01:42:00.615 --> 01:42:02.925
What's the matter with you two?

01:42:21.102 --> 01:42:22.158
Sir.

01:42:22.203 --> 01:42:23.460
What? I found Chick.

01:42:23.505 --> 01:42:26.062
Here we go on three. One, two...

01:42:26.107 --> 01:42:27.814
Three!

01:42:30.812 --> 01:42:34.571
I knew you'd come.

01:42:34.616 --> 01:42:37.273
You're looking to get
your life cut short.

01:42:37.318 --> 01:42:39.423
We'll have to see about that.

01:42:50.798 --> 01:42:53.156
You scumbags!

01:42:53.201 --> 01:42:54.757
I, Mu Myeong is here!

01:42:54.802 --> 01:42:57.560
Bring it on if you dare.

01:42:57.605 --> 01:43:02.165
I'll crush you with
the fist of justice.

01:43:02.210 --> 01:43:04.767
Bring it on! Come on...

01:43:04.812 --> 01:43:05.969
What's he doing?

01:43:06.014 --> 01:43:08.271
Come on, get him!

01:43:08.316 --> 01:43:10.523
Show me what you got...

01:43:18.026 --> 01:43:21.851
Whoever catches him
gets the reward.

01:43:21.896 --> 01:43:25.355
No complaints about your
shares, okay?

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:26.856
Fine by me.

01:43:26.901 --> 01:43:28.958
Ready!

01:43:29.003 --> 01:43:30.160
Just follow me.

01:43:30.205 --> 01:43:31.761
You follow me.

01:43:31.806 --> 01:43:33.513
Go!

01:43:57.999 --> 01:44:02.505
"THE HUNTRESSES"
