00:58.797 --> 00:59.624
Madeleine?

01:09.982 --> 01:11.332
Madeleine!

01:15.292 --> 01:16.641
Madeleine!

01:48.586 --> 01:50.284
Oh. No, no.

02:28.452 --> 02:32.500
Mama.
Mama. Mama. Mama!

02:35.067 --> 02:36.504
Mama!

02:40.421 --> 02:43.772
-

02:43.815 --> 02:45.861
-

02:48.385 --> 02:50.866
-

02:53.477 --> 02:55.262
-

03:01.572 --> 03:04.009
Mama!

03:08.275 --> 03:09.450
-

03:34.953 --> 03:39.654
Is Mr. White home?
- No. He's gone.

03:39.697 --> 03:43.397
My name
is Lyutsifer Safin.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.921
Your husband killed my family.

03:45.964 --> 03:48.445
I told you, he's gone.

03:48.489 --> 03:51.970
I know.
This will hurt him more.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.407
-

04:11.163 --> 04:14.428
-

04:33.534 --> 04:35.449
-

07:13.781 --> 07:14.695
You okay?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.133
Yes.

07:20.222 --> 07:21.484
Let's go.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.239
How's the view?

07:39.154 --> 07:39.850
It's growing on me.

07:44.028 --> 07:44.681
Can you go faster?

07:46.422 --> 07:47.597
We don't need to go faster.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.645
We have all the time
in the world.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.547
-

08:31.815 --> 08:34.252
-

08:34.296 --> 08:36.777
You can't help
looking over your shoulder.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.475
-What?
-No one is coming.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.956
I wasn't looking
over my shoulder.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.348
-Yes, you were.
-No.

08:43.392 --> 08:44.524
Are we gonna
have a row about this?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.396
What are they burning?

08:47.439 --> 08:50.747
Secrets. Wishes.
Letting go of the past.

08:50.791 --> 08:53.228
Getting rid of old things,
in come the new.

09:27.088 --> 09:28.045
Where did you go to?

09:29.873 --> 09:32.093
Today, by the water. Hmm?

09:32.136 --> 09:33.573
Tell me.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.012
I'll tell you
if you tell me about Vesper.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.539
Is that why we're here?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.062
She's buried at the acropolis.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.150
I know where she's buried.

09:48.326 --> 09:51.591
Can you forgive her? For us?

09:54.245 --> 09:55.943
I left her behind
a long time ago.

10:01.862 --> 10:04.386
As long as we're looking
over our shoulder,

10:04.429 --> 10:05.517
the past is not dead.

10:11.611 --> 10:15.353
You have to let her go,
even if it's hard.

10:15.397 --> 10:18.269
You mean, um,
if we're to have a future?

10:18.313 --> 10:19.401
Mm-hmm.

10:21.359 --> 10:23.840
So, I do this, and then...

10:23.884 --> 10:25.842
I'll tell you all my secrets.

10:28.976 --> 10:29.890
Okay.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.386
-

11:40.003 --> 11:42.963
I'm going to go
and do this,

11:43.006 --> 11:44.355
and then I'm going
to come back for breakfast.

11:47.097 --> 11:49.665
Thank you.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.102
And then
you're going to tell me
where we're going next.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.499
Home.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.006
I miss you.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.458
What...

14:24.472 --> 14:24.994
Madeleine?

14:27.083 --> 14:27.867
Madeleine?

15:00.421 --> 15:02.118
-

16:21.284 --> 16:22.416
Blofeld sends his regards.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.289
You know...

16:26.333 --> 16:29.162
Madeleine,
she is a daughter of Spectre.

16:30.337 --> 16:33.470
She's a daughter of Spectre.

17:18.254 --> 17:20.256
Your baggage
is already down, Mr. Bond.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.866
As your wife requested.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.049
You were right.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.097
Letting go is hard.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.533
James.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.100
What happened?

17:39.928 --> 17:42.800
-What happened?
-How did they know I was here?

17:42.844 --> 17:44.237
-What are you talking about?
-Madeleine,

17:44.280 --> 17:46.717
how did they know I was here?

17:46.761 --> 17:48.893
-I have no idea what you're--
-Spectre. How did they know?

17:48.937 --> 17:50.504
What are you talking about?
James!

17:53.594 --> 17:54.334
I didn't do anything.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.859
-I didn't do anything.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.736
We're leaving.

18:20.882 --> 18:21.796
There is something
I need to tell you.

18:22.405 --> 18:23.624
I bet there is.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.109
James!

18:44.427 --> 18:46.125
-

18:52.131 --> 18:53.741
Pick it up. Pick it up!

19:06.884 --> 19:08.190
It's Blofeld, my love.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.974
Your father
would be so proud of you.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.674
Your sacrifice
will be our glory.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.632
-I don't understand.
-Bravo.

19:15.676 --> 19:18.200
-

19:28.645 --> 19:32.693
James, why?
Why would I betray you?

19:32.736 --> 19:36.305
We all have our secrets,
we just didn't
get to yours yet.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.440
-

20:08.076 --> 20:10.426
James. James, listen to me.

20:10.470 --> 20:11.906
I'd rather die
than you think I'm--

20:13.255 --> 20:16.215
-

20:58.257 --> 21:00.824
-

21:05.742 --> 21:08.049
-

21:12.314 --> 21:13.446
James!

21:15.186 --> 21:16.492
James!

21:16.536 --> 21:17.493
Do something. James!

21:20.540 --> 21:22.063
Say something, James!

21:23.673 --> 21:24.935
Please.

21:35.642 --> 21:36.556
Okay.

22:33.090 --> 22:33.961
Come on.

22:48.976 --> 22:52.414
So, this is it?

22:54.460 --> 22:55.417
This is it.

23:04.513 --> 23:05.949
How will I know
that you're okay?

23:07.429 --> 23:08.517
You won't.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.762
Please
remember to back up

27:56.805 --> 27:58.372
all data by 10:00 p.m.
this evening

27:58.415 --> 27:59.895
due to planned
server maintenance.

28:02.463 --> 28:04.378
You okay?

28:04.421 --> 28:06.032
You know the, uh, SL5,

28:06.075 --> 28:08.295
the weaponized smallpox
I was using this morning?

28:08.338 --> 28:12.212
Have you seen it?
I... I put it in the bloody...

28:12.255 --> 28:14.170
Valdo, you haven't seen a tub
of smallpox, have you?

28:16.651 --> 28:19.306
This was a good soup.

28:19.349 --> 28:22.788
Now it is waste,
even if it is joke.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.224
-

28:24.267 --> 28:26.661
There is more complexity
in my tomato soup

28:26.705 --> 28:29.142
than in both
of your brains combined.

28:29.185 --> 28:31.971
Valdo, that is so unkind.
It's so...

28:32.014 --> 28:35.061
One day
I will put Ebola in your tea.

28:35.104 --> 28:38.412
And then I will watch
as your faces sweat blood...

28:38.455 --> 28:40.457
-...and I will be laughing.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.808
-Nice. Keep your hair on.
-Wow.

28:42.851 --> 28:45.158
He's got a terrifying
imagination, hasn't he?

28:45.201 --> 28:46.942
Dr. Obruchev.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.422
They are coming.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.989
-Who?
-Spectre.

28:55.603 --> 28:58.171
-Safin.
-Do not try to stop them.

28:58.214 --> 28:59.912
This is what
we've been waiting for.

29:03.350 --> 29:06.483
They will ask you to enter
Bio Security Level Four fridge

29:06.527 --> 29:08.485
and remove the weapon.

29:08.529 --> 29:11.924
No one must see
what you are doing.

29:11.967 --> 29:15.144
They will not kill you.
They think they need you.

29:15.188 --> 29:18.800
-They will not kill me?
-

29:18.844 --> 29:22.021
Transferring the files
as we speak.

29:22.064 --> 29:25.459
Now... Now it's done.
What do I do with it?

29:25.502 --> 29:27.026
Swallow it. Goodbye.

29:27.069 --> 29:28.549
-Swallow the...
-

29:28.592 --> 29:32.988
Yes, I like animals!

29:33.032 --> 29:33.989
Bye-bye.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.048
Danger,
illegal access detected.

29:49.091 --> 29:51.485
Secure all biohazardous
materials immediately.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.447
Move! Follow!

29:59.667 --> 30:02.191
No! No!
- Caution.

30:02.235 --> 30:04.715
Unauthorized personnel
located in this sector.

30:15.161 --> 30:17.032
Please,
we're scientists,
we're unarmed.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.207
We're unarmed.
What do you want?

30:21.036 --> 30:22.821
Valdo Obruchev.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.866
Hello.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.042
Open the Bio Security
Level Four fridge.

30:28.783 --> 30:30.872
-And, uh...
-Give me the weapon.

30:30.916 --> 30:34.484
The weap-- What weapon?
We have, uh...

30:35.224 --> 30:36.791
Heracles.

30:36.835 --> 30:39.011
It requires
double authentication.

30:39.054 --> 30:40.012
Which one?

30:42.579 --> 30:44.277
Him.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.453
Hardy. Hardy! Don't let them.

30:46.496 --> 30:48.716
Don't let them.
Don't let them, please.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.761
-

31:32.586 --> 31:35.067
-Oh.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.851
Warning,

31:36.895 --> 31:39.201
facility lockdown in progress.

31:39.245 --> 31:42.639
-All exits are now sealed.
-

31:42.683 --> 31:44.903
Warning,
facility lockdown in progress.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.818
All exits are now sealed.

31:50.169 --> 31:53.302
Oh, what is, uh...
It's a safety belt? This?

31:57.176 --> 31:58.133
Wow.

32:14.410 --> 32:16.412
I... I cannot!

32:16.456 --> 32:18.327
There is no elevator!

32:28.598 --> 32:32.515
-

32:45.311 --> 32:47.182
Sir, I've just received
the most unusual--

32:47.226 --> 32:48.096
I've seen it.

32:55.016 --> 32:56.539
Oh, Jesus Christ.

33:00.848 --> 33:04.939
Sir, what's
the Heracles project?

33:04.983 --> 33:07.463
-This lab isn't on the books.

33:07.507 --> 33:08.203
No, it's not.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.165
-There were casualties.
-It was a gas leak.

33:14.296 --> 33:15.732
Shall I alert the PM?

33:15.776 --> 33:17.212
It was a gas leak.
I'll handle it.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.213
Moneypenny.

33:20.650 --> 33:21.695
Where's 007?

35:41.313 --> 35:43.358
-

35:50.409 --> 35:51.888
Well,
isn't this a surprise, Felix?

35:51.932 --> 35:52.933
James.

35:54.413 --> 35:55.153
Who's the blond?

35:56.719 --> 35:59.505
Logan Ash, State Department.
It's really nice to meet you.

35:59.548 --> 36:03.770
I've heard a lot about you.
I mean, I'm a huge fan.

36:03.813 --> 36:05.337
Babylon.
- Police boy.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.425
I need a favor, brother.

36:06.468 --> 36:08.296
You didn't get the memo?
I'm retired.

36:08.340 --> 36:09.602
I wouldn't ask
if you were still

36:09.645 --> 36:11.343
in Her Majesty's Service.

36:11.386 --> 36:12.605
And what does that mean?

36:14.476 --> 36:16.826
Our elected leaders aren't
playing nice in the sandbox.

36:18.611 --> 36:21.135
James.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.399
Is there somewhere quiet
where we can talk in private?

36:26.184 --> 36:28.882
Quiet? Yeah.

36:28.925 --> 36:31.537
-

36:31.580 --> 36:33.234
I was hoping
you could pick up
a package.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.279
Five.
- Four.

36:36.672 --> 36:37.847
Where's the package?

36:37.891 --> 36:39.719
Short trip. Cuba.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.244
Oh, I love it there?

36:43.288 --> 36:45.638
Hey. Valdo Obruchev.

36:45.681 --> 36:47.292
You're gonna say
you never heard of him.

36:47.335 --> 36:50.033
-Never heard of him. Two.
-Three.

36:50.077 --> 36:53.123
Ah... It's a good life.

36:53.167 --> 36:55.474
You never heard of him?

36:55.517 --> 36:57.519
Didn't he defect
during your tenure at MI6?

36:57.563 --> 36:59.652
Obruchev was kidnapped
three days ago

36:59.695 --> 37:01.915
from a secret MI6 lab
in London.

37:01.958 --> 37:04.657
Two days ago, his mug pinged
on a facial-recognition sweep

37:04.700 --> 37:07.181
in Santiago de Cuba.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.661
He's leaving out
the best part.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.489
Spectre.

37:10.532 --> 37:13.143
I have a contact there,
says they're gathering.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.321
Coincidence?

37:17.974 --> 37:20.412
Come on.
It'll be like old times.

37:21.978 --> 37:22.675
-Three.
-Two.

37:27.157 --> 37:28.898
You're really
the only guy for the job.

37:30.160 --> 37:32.902
-You're the guy.
-It's my round.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.434
Hi.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.092
-Scotch.
-Yeah, man.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.533
Where'd you find
the Book of Mormon?

37:54.576 --> 37:57.536
Political appointee.
Not my choice.

37:57.579 --> 37:59.668
Seems intelligence
isn't central anymore.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.323
He smiles too much.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.282
Help us get this
into the right hands.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.718
Oh, what,
and you're the right hands?

38:05.761 --> 38:07.415
I'm not just a pretty face.

38:07.459 --> 38:10.026
I stopped trusting
pretty faces
a long time ago, Felix.

38:10.070 --> 38:12.028
Yeah, I heard. Bad luck.

38:12.072 --> 38:14.596
-Bad judgment.
-Yeah.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.250
Harder to tell
the good from bad,

38:16.294 --> 38:17.773
villains from heroes
these days.

38:19.340 --> 38:21.386
I need you, James.

38:21.429 --> 38:22.343
You're the only one
I trust with this.

38:22.387 --> 38:23.910
I'm not screwing around.

38:23.953 --> 38:25.303
I wanna get back to my family,

38:25.346 --> 38:27.087
tell them
I saved the world again.

38:27.740 --> 38:28.741
Don't you?

38:32.353 --> 38:33.441
Nice to see you again, Felix.

38:35.661 --> 38:37.532
-At least take my number.
-I've got your number.

39:03.993 --> 39:05.560
In trouble?

39:08.389 --> 39:09.521
Constantly.

39:09.564 --> 39:10.739
Need a ride?

39:12.567 --> 39:13.481
Sure. Why not?

39:17.746 --> 39:18.486
Hold on.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.057
What's your name?
-Nomi.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.581
-Yours?
-James. Call me James.

39:26.625 --> 39:29.236
-What do you do, Nomi?
-I'm a diver.

39:29.279 --> 39:33.022
-What do you dive for?
-I have a thing for old wrecks.

39:33.066 --> 39:35.938
Well, then you've
come to the right place.
-

39:42.162 --> 39:43.555
After you.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.612
Hmm...

39:57.656 --> 39:58.874
Nice house.

39:58.918 --> 40:01.094
Thank you.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.051
Is that the bedroom?

40:06.708 --> 40:07.579
Yes, it is.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.425
Well,
that's not the first thing

40:27.468 --> 40:29.078
I thought you'd take off,
but, uh...

40:29.122 --> 40:30.950
Yeah.

40:30.993 --> 40:33.996
You seem like a man
who's gagging

40:34.040 --> 40:38.131
-for some action, Mr. Bond.
-Shall we cut to the chase?

40:38.174 --> 40:40.133
I'm here
as a professional courtesy.

40:40.176 --> 40:41.221
Well, you're not very
courteous, are you?

40:41.264 --> 40:43.397
You've broken my car...

40:43.441 --> 40:45.312
It's Commander Bond,
but you know that.

40:47.270 --> 40:49.272
-Double-0?
-Two years.

40:49.316 --> 40:50.752
-Very young.
-High achiever.

40:50.796 --> 40:53.538
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-The world's moved on

40:53.581 --> 40:55.714
since you retired,
Commander Bond.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.455
-Perhaps you didn't notice.
-No, can't say I had.

40:58.368 --> 41:00.370
And in my humble opinion,

41:00.414 --> 41:01.894
the world
doesn't change very much.

41:01.937 --> 41:04.070
You would say that.

41:04.113 --> 41:05.767
Look,
this all seems like heaven,

41:05.811 --> 41:07.421
this little bubble,
or whatever.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.988
-But it's so obvious

41:09.031 --> 41:11.251
you're a man
who only has time to kill,

41:11.294 --> 41:13.166
nothing to live for.

41:13.209 --> 41:16.822
So Valdo Obruchev
is off-limits.

41:16.865 --> 41:19.085
You get in my way, I will put
a bullet in your knee.

41:21.130 --> 41:22.044
The one that works.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.614
You need to ask yourself
a few more questions.

41:29.530 --> 41:32.011
MI6, CIA
chasing after the same man,

41:32.054 --> 41:34.796
not communicating
with each other, that...

41:34.840 --> 41:37.625
-That's not good.
-Hmm.

41:37.669 --> 41:40.976
You know what?
Tell M hello, but...

41:41.020 --> 41:41.847
I don't work for him anymore.

41:43.849 --> 41:45.328
Tell him yourself.

41:47.809 --> 41:49.768
By the way,

41:49.811 --> 41:51.726
I'm not just any old double-0.

41:52.814 --> 41:54.337
I'm 007.

41:57.036 --> 41:58.603
You probably
thought they'd retire it.

42:01.301 --> 42:04.043
-It's just a number.
-

42:04.086 --> 42:05.174
Yeah.

42:07.002 --> 42:07.655
See you in Cuba?

42:10.615 --> 42:12.355
How's it going, Q?

42:12.399 --> 42:14.444
Several large files seem
to have been wiped

42:14.488 --> 42:16.011
from Obruchev's hard drive.

42:16.055 --> 42:18.623
He was working on some
pretty advanced algorithm...

42:18.666 --> 42:21.408
-Can you retrieve the files?
-Trying.

42:21.451 --> 42:23.758
Get me everything you can
and then destroy the drive.

42:23.802 --> 42:25.499
If I knew more about
what this was, I could...

42:25.543 --> 42:28.154
-Thank you, Q. That's all.
-

42:28.197 --> 42:29.851
Yes. One minute.
The PM is calling again.

42:29.895 --> 42:31.723
007.
Tell them something. Anything.

42:34.639 --> 42:36.771
-007.
- M, darling.

42:36.815 --> 42:37.685
Couple of things.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.603
-Bond.
-I met your new 007.

42:42.647 --> 42:44.170
She's a disarming young woman.

42:45.084 --> 42:47.608
So, Obruchev.

42:47.652 --> 42:49.523
You kept him
on the payroll, didn't you?

42:49.567 --> 42:52.091
Stay out of it.
This has nothing
to do with you.

42:52.134 --> 42:54.397
It does. It's Spectre.

42:54.441 --> 42:58.053
Mallory, what have you done?

43:08.107 --> 43:09.804
-Double-0 trouble?
-The CIA have the advantage.

43:10.892 --> 43:12.415
Get me Blofeld.

43:12.459 --> 43:14.113
Sir, he only speaks
to his psychiatrist.

43:14.156 --> 43:15.810
I know.
The live feed's what I want.

43:22.121 --> 43:24.427
They stay
straight in the middle.

43:24.471 --> 43:26.429
And then they bring him up.

43:26.473 --> 43:29.041
He's like this every day,
mad as a bag of bees.

43:29.084 --> 43:31.521
It's crowning day.
-Good.

43:31.565 --> 43:35.264
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

43:35.308 --> 43:38.833
It's clean as can be.
Everyone just wants a party.

43:38.877 --> 43:40.095
Yeah, I want them both
to hear me.

43:41.662 --> 43:42.707
Be a surprise.

44:08.733 --> 44:11.126
Felix, I'm in.

44:11.170 --> 44:13.172
He's in.

44:13.215 --> 44:15.261
There's a young lady
in Santiago I want you to meet.

44:49.425 --> 44:54.169
-

45:04.789 --> 45:05.615
Paloma?

45:08.618 --> 45:11.926
-You're late. Vamos.
-I...

45:11.970 --> 45:14.450
Uh, something about a hat?
Paris, uh...

45:14.494 --> 45:15.887
Huh? What hat?

45:19.020 --> 45:21.849
I forget things
when I get nervous.

45:21.893 --> 45:23.155
This is the biggest job
I've ever had.

45:37.256 --> 45:37.865
This your room?

45:39.301 --> 45:40.128
It's a wine cellar.

45:42.522 --> 45:43.958
Okay, come here.

45:47.962 --> 45:49.703
Don't you think we ought
to get to know each other

45:49.747 --> 45:51.749
just a little bit
before we, um...

45:51.792 --> 45:54.273
No, no, no, no.

45:54.316 --> 45:58.059
Um, no, I'm sorry.
Um...

45:58.103 --> 45:59.800
-All right.
-You do it.

45:59.844 --> 46:01.236
Thank you.

46:04.979 --> 46:05.980
Do you mind, uh...

46:11.507 --> 46:14.815
-This is gonna go brilliantly.
-I know.

46:14.859 --> 46:15.773
I've done
three weeks' training.

46:39.144 --> 46:40.362
-Let's get a drink.

46:41.581 --> 46:43.235
Good idea.

46:47.935 --> 46:50.459
Two vodka martinis,
shaken, not stirred.

46:50.503 --> 46:51.243
Si, senor.

47:03.255 --> 47:04.822
-So I can hear you.

47:11.741 --> 47:12.742
What shall we drink to?

47:14.527 --> 47:16.007
-Felix?
-To Felix.

47:18.618 --> 47:19.837
Remind me to get him a cigar.

47:30.325 --> 47:31.544
Vamos?

47:31.587 --> 47:32.675
-Sure.
-Okay.

47:34.764 --> 47:40.031
-

47:41.597 --> 47:43.643
Will this sample
be enough for you?

47:43.686 --> 47:46.298
If he has used it, yes.

47:46.341 --> 47:47.473
It is now progressing.

47:54.697 --> 47:56.351
Oops. Sorry.

47:58.005 --> 48:01.052
Terrible, terrible gloves.
So slippery.

48:02.227 --> 48:03.097
Forgive me.

48:03.793 --> 48:04.882
How much longer?

48:09.669 --> 48:11.105
A-ha.

48:13.238 --> 48:15.109
To happy new future
for Spectre.

48:18.243 --> 48:19.070
Now, it is ready.

48:46.010 --> 48:49.143
-

48:50.188 --> 48:51.580
You go that way.

48:51.624 --> 48:53.017
I'll go this way.

49:00.763 --> 49:03.114
What is this?
Spectre bunga-bunga?

49:05.246 --> 49:07.466
You ever been
to a party like this?

49:07.509 --> 49:08.989
How do you think
I got this job?

49:09.033 --> 49:11.035
Don't get distracted, now.

49:11.078 --> 49:13.211
Remember, we're looking
for our Russian scientist.

49:13.254 --> 49:14.734
I'm seeing
a lot of Spectre agents.

49:14.777 --> 49:16.954
Yes.

49:16.997 --> 49:17.955
And it looks like all of them.

49:22.655 --> 49:23.743
Wow.

49:34.884 --> 49:36.234
Friend of yours?

49:36.277 --> 49:39.498
Cyclops. We ran
into each other in Italy.

49:39.541 --> 49:42.718
That was
an eye-opening experience.

49:44.894 --> 49:46.592
They're wearing earpieces.

49:46.635 --> 49:48.289
Scanning.

49:56.689 --> 49:59.605
It'll be clean.
It's good.
It's as good as can be.

49:59.648 --> 50:01.433
It's my party.
-Ah. Found it.

50:01.476 --> 50:03.435
Celebrate me,
my birthday,

50:03.478 --> 50:04.653
my crowning day.

50:07.047 --> 50:08.440
Who's the birthday boy?

50:08.483 --> 50:10.224
Um...

50:10.268 --> 50:13.575
-Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
-Is he here?

50:13.619 --> 50:14.881
No, he's...

50:14.924 --> 50:16.535
Make your way.
Follow the music.

50:16.578 --> 50:18.493
He's in London in prison.

50:18.537 --> 50:20.756
How do you know for sure?

50:20.800 --> 50:22.976
Because I put him there.

50:23.020 --> 50:25.065
...feel my warm embrace.

50:25.109 --> 50:28.025
Experience
a delicious surprise.

50:29.765 --> 50:31.898
Let us shepherd humanity

50:31.941 --> 50:33.247
with our new power.

50:33.291 --> 50:34.553
I've spotted him,

50:34.596 --> 50:37.295
our little Russian scientist.

50:37.338 --> 50:38.774
Have you got him?
- I'm here.

50:38.818 --> 50:41.299
-I got him.
- Stay with him.

50:41.342 --> 50:44.215
But I see you
from my little eye,

50:44.258 --> 50:46.695
and my little eye says hi.

50:46.739 --> 50:50.438
Now, see, now,

50:50.482 --> 50:53.528
we emerge from the shadows
as gods on Mount Olympus.

50:55.356 --> 50:58.272
Here's to the end
of our pariah.

50:58.316 --> 51:01.232
Oh, my burden, my brother...

51:03.408 --> 51:04.539
James Bond.

51:06.150 --> 51:07.890
Goodbye, James.

51:07.934 --> 51:10.806
-

51:10.850 --> 51:13.070
You're popular tonight.

51:14.419 --> 51:16.116
You can't run.

51:16.160 --> 51:18.075
-It's too late.
-

51:21.295 --> 51:25.125
It's already crawling
under your skin.

51:25.169 --> 51:27.606
Don't be alarmed,
it's harmless to us.

51:27.649 --> 51:30.783
-Just to him. So delicious.
-

51:38.312 --> 51:39.357
Sir!

51:42.795 --> 51:44.318
It is working.

51:44.362 --> 51:46.103
It is working.
Only Spectre are dying.

51:58.202 --> 51:59.899
Hello.

51:59.942 --> 52:02.989
Are you for my, uh, esco...

52:03.032 --> 52:05.600
Hmm?
-No? Oh.

52:11.780 --> 52:13.304
Go!

52:24.924 --> 52:26.882
-Thank you. I'll take this.
- No!

52:26.926 --> 52:27.666
-What was that?
- Get him!

52:37.415 --> 52:38.372
Time to go. Let's go!

52:50.776 --> 52:52.604
It's clear.

52:56.869 --> 52:58.349
May I cut in?

53:02.396 --> 53:04.659
Go get him.
I'll hold them off.

53:04.703 --> 53:06.618
Cover the exits!

53:06.661 --> 53:07.358
Paloma.

53:11.405 --> 53:12.363
Don't let them
get away!

53:18.020 --> 53:19.718
Have you got them?

53:19.761 --> 53:21.415
Nearly.

53:21.459 --> 53:22.460
No!

53:39.651 --> 53:40.695
Down!

53:44.133 --> 53:45.657
Get them!
Don't let them get away!

53:45.700 --> 53:47.311
Paloma,
I know you're busy,

53:47.354 --> 53:49.487
but the curtain's about
to come down on this one.

53:49.530 --> 53:50.966
I can get a car.
Where do you need it?

53:51.010 --> 53:52.794
I'll be right there.

53:58.931 --> 54:00.019
Stay down!

54:03.152 --> 54:04.241
Move!

54:33.357 --> 54:34.271
Huh?

54:44.019 --> 54:44.542
Come on!

54:52.941 --> 54:54.508
Three weeks' training,
really?

54:54.552 --> 54:55.596
More or less.

54:55.640 --> 54:56.989
We're still gonna
need that car.

54:57.032 --> 54:58.469
-Salud!
-Salud!

55:23.624 --> 55:25.583
Where are you taking me?

55:25.626 --> 55:26.801
I'm taking you back
to Mother, darling.

55:26.845 --> 55:28.325
Mother? Oh, no, no, no.

55:33.112 --> 55:34.026
Huh. There you are.

55:39.553 --> 55:41.512
-

55:42.643 --> 55:43.514
No!

55:50.651 --> 55:52.131
-Stay there!

55:52.174 --> 55:54.176
-You okay?
-I'm great.

56:02.271 --> 56:04.622
I'm gonna borrow
your plane. Sorry.

56:26.426 --> 56:27.209
It's a shortcut.

56:41.659 --> 56:43.617
This is my stop. Goodbye.

56:46.490 --> 56:48.405
-You were excellent.
-You too.

56:48.448 --> 56:51.364
-Next time, stay longer.
-I will.

56:51.408 --> 56:53.192
-Hey, a cigar for Felix.
-Thank you. Come on.

56:53.235 --> 56:54.454
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

57:02.288 --> 57:03.942
Come on, let's go.

57:03.985 --> 57:06.901
No, no, no, sir,
I am not getting on that.

57:06.945 --> 57:10.165
Well, that's a shame
because we don't have a choice.

57:10.209 --> 57:11.950
Let's go. Come on.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.911
Okay, okay,
what have we got here?

57:32.144 --> 57:36.322
Sir, I just saved
your life, okay?
Please remember that.

57:36.365 --> 57:39.891
So, could you please tell me
what the hell is going on?

57:39.934 --> 57:40.935
Where are you taking me?

57:42.502 --> 57:43.677
Somewhere safe.

58:09.486 --> 58:12.314
At least make it look hard.

58:12.358 --> 58:13.707
Thanks, Felix,
you walked me into a trap.
Get in.

58:16.580 --> 58:19.147
-What trap?
- Spectre's dead. Sit.

58:19.191 --> 58:20.540
Who's dead?
-All of them.

58:20.584 --> 58:21.541
Good.

58:24.065 --> 58:27.112
What is this?
Explain it to me.

58:27.155 --> 58:29.767
I don't have the words
to describe
to someone like you.

58:29.810 --> 58:30.681
Try one.

58:32.204 --> 58:34.989
It's perfect.

58:35.033 --> 58:36.295
A perfect what?

58:36.338 --> 58:37.992
What? Assassin.

58:38.036 --> 58:39.951
Thank you, Bond,
your mission's done.

58:39.994 --> 58:41.343
Why didn't it kill me?
-You don't have to answer

58:41.387 --> 58:43.389
-those questions. Bond!
-Why Spectre?

58:43.432 --> 58:44.956
-Bond, please stop
asking these questions.
-Quiet!

58:44.999 --> 58:46.827
Speak up.

58:46.871 --> 58:50.265
Because you were never
the intended target.

58:50.309 --> 58:52.267
He was a target? Why?

58:52.311 --> 58:54.531
I changed the DNA
like we decided.

58:54.574 --> 58:56.228
Now the plan is complete

58:56.271 --> 58:57.751
-and I'm confused.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

58:57.795 --> 58:59.753
Who is "we"?
Did M make you build this?

58:59.797 --> 59:01.233
He is out of line here, Felix.

59:01.276 --> 59:03.148
Did M order you
to kill Spectre?

59:03.191 --> 59:04.758
-Don't answer that!
-Is M behind this?

59:04.802 --> 59:06.238
-He is out of line!
-Felix!

59:06.281 --> 59:07.979
Ash, shut your mouth!

59:08.022 --> 59:10.024
M.
M helped me build it.

59:10.068 --> 59:12.070
But please,
he does not have the vision

59:12.113 --> 59:14.594
-for how to use it.
-Well, who does? Who does?

59:14.638 --> 59:17.728
Blofeld? How did he know
I was going to be there?

59:25.605 --> 59:27.041
Oh!

1:00:15.394 --> 1:00:16.700
I'm with Safin.
You understand?

1:00:16.743 --> 1:00:19.137
Yes. I am Dr. Obruchev.

1:00:19.180 --> 1:00:20.834
I know who you are.

1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:26.361
I don't know about you,

1:00:26.405 --> 1:00:28.625
but I got a feeling in my gut
Ash might not be on our side.

1:00:30.670 --> 1:00:32.106
We need to have a conversation

1:00:32.150 --> 1:00:33.499
about the company you keep.

1:00:33.542 --> 1:00:34.805
I'm with you.

1:00:37.982 --> 1:00:38.678
That's a lot of blood.

1:00:42.856 --> 1:00:45.119
So,
where are we going?

1:00:46.730 --> 1:00:48.079
Get in the plane, Doctor.

1:00:48.122 --> 1:00:50.124
This might be my last mission.

1:00:50.168 --> 1:00:51.865
-What do you think?
-I think you're just looking

1:00:51.909 --> 1:00:53.432
for an excuse
not to help me.

1:00:53.475 --> 1:00:55.521
-There you go.

1:00:55.564 --> 1:00:57.436
Paloma, she gave me a cigar
for you to smoke,

1:00:57.479 --> 1:00:59.177
and you are gonna smoke it.

1:00:59.220 --> 1:01:01.919
Nice, but maybe you should
hold on to that for now.

1:01:01.962 --> 1:01:04.530
You just stay put.
Keep the pressure on that.

1:01:04.573 --> 1:01:05.879
I'm gonna find us a way out.

1:01:07.925 --> 1:01:10.014
I'll be over here.

1:01:10.057 --> 1:01:11.189
You know, Felix, we really
need to stop meeting--

1:01:17.804 --> 1:01:20.677
Ooh.
-Okay.

1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:22.679
I was such
a big fan of his.

1:01:29.250 --> 1:01:30.687
Felix!

1:01:43.743 --> 1:01:44.831
This doesn't look good.

1:01:46.485 --> 1:01:51.142
Come on, Felix,
we've been in worse
than this. Let's go.

1:01:51.185 --> 1:01:54.188
It's like back when I was
a kid on that shrimp boat.

1:01:54.232 --> 1:01:56.190
You're from Milwaukee.

1:01:56.234 --> 1:01:57.931
Am I?
I thought I made that up.

1:02:04.546 --> 1:02:07.027
-He got me.
-

1:02:07.071 --> 1:02:09.334
Just let me go.
Let me go.

1:02:16.558 --> 1:02:17.734
You got this?

1:02:20.824 --> 1:02:21.955
Yeah. Yeah.

1:02:24.436 --> 1:02:25.742
Make it worth it.

1:02:28.527 --> 1:02:30.572
James,

1:02:30.616 --> 1:02:32.879
it's a good life, isn't it?

1:02:35.229 --> 1:02:36.753
The best.

1:02:41.192 --> 1:02:42.193
Felix.

1:02:45.326 --> 1:02:46.980
Felix. Felix.

1:05:16.347 --> 1:05:17.522
-Name?
-Bond.

1:05:21.178 --> 1:05:22.831
James Bond.

1:05:27.575 --> 1:05:28.881
How's retirement?

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:29.969
Quiet.

1:05:32.624 --> 1:05:35.932
Hi. Where's Obruchev?

1:05:35.975 --> 1:05:37.846
I thought you two
would get along.

1:05:37.890 --> 1:05:40.110
-Report, 007.
-Thank you.

1:05:41.502 --> 1:05:42.721
00... 7.

1:05:44.636 --> 1:05:45.942
That must bother you.

1:05:49.554 --> 1:05:50.772
Where is he?

1:05:50.816 --> 1:05:52.470
He left me for somebody else.

1:05:52.513 --> 1:05:53.950
It's, uh...

1:05:53.993 --> 1:05:55.864
-So, you lost him?
-You can go in.

1:05:55.908 --> 1:05:58.128
-Thank you.
-Thank y...

1:05:58.171 --> 1:05:59.216
Alone, I'm afraid.

1:06:01.174 --> 1:06:02.132
Oh, does that bother you?

1:06:09.617 --> 1:06:10.792
I get why you shot him.

1:06:10.836 --> 1:06:11.750
Yeah, well,

1:06:11.793 --> 1:06:14.057
everyone tries at least once.

1:06:18.626 --> 1:06:21.064
Has this desk got bigger?

1:06:23.631 --> 1:06:24.632
Or have you got smaller?

1:06:27.548 --> 1:06:29.768
I can't pretend there
weren't some sorry faces

1:06:29.811 --> 1:06:31.030
when you left us, Bond,

1:06:31.074 --> 1:06:33.990
but you fell
so far off the grid

1:06:34.033 --> 1:06:34.991
that we thought
you must be dead.

1:06:36.993 --> 1:06:38.211
Now, learning that you

1:06:39.865 --> 1:06:41.998
were, in fact,
alive and well, and...

1:06:43.912 --> 1:06:46.176
working for the CIA, well...

1:06:50.049 --> 1:06:51.268
Well, that really was a blow.

1:06:51.311 --> 1:06:54.227
Well,
they just asked so nicely.

1:06:56.273 --> 1:06:58.449
It's a shame that you
haven't lost your touch.

1:07:00.146 --> 1:07:01.408
We wouldn't be in this mess.

1:07:03.019 --> 1:07:04.194
This is your mess.

1:07:06.370 --> 1:07:08.067
Blofeld tried to kill me
in Cuba,

1:07:08.111 --> 1:07:09.938
but someone hijacked his plan.

1:07:11.114 --> 1:07:13.029
And whoever stole your weapon

1:07:13.072 --> 1:07:15.901
used it
to wipe out Spectre instead.

1:07:15.944 --> 1:07:18.991
Now your weapon is on the run

1:07:19.035 --> 1:07:21.776
and nobody seems
to know who has it.

1:07:21.820 --> 1:07:23.648
So you can imagine
why I've come back to play.

1:07:23.691 --> 1:07:25.345
We're looking into it.

1:07:25.389 --> 1:07:27.478
I can identify
the man that took Obruchev.

1:07:27.521 --> 1:07:28.827
And what do you want
in return, Bond?

1:07:30.263 --> 1:07:31.351
Blofeld.

1:07:31.395 --> 1:07:33.788
Impossible. He's in Belmarsh.

1:07:33.832 --> 1:07:36.269
Yes. He ran a Spectre meeting

1:07:36.313 --> 1:07:38.489
in Cuba from Belmarsh.

1:07:38.532 --> 1:07:40.143
-How?
-No.

1:07:40.186 --> 1:07:42.971
How?
No one has access. No one.

1:07:43.015 --> 1:07:46.758
Why didn't you shut it down?

1:07:46.801 --> 1:07:48.542
Why didn't you
shut Heracles down?

1:07:48.586 --> 1:07:51.763
I answer to the interests
of my country, not you.

1:07:51.806 --> 1:07:55.027
-And to Felix Leiter?
-I certainly don't answer
to Felix Leiter.

1:07:55.071 --> 1:07:56.942
Perhaps because he's dead.

1:08:03.775 --> 1:08:05.081
I'm sorry.

1:08:07.257 --> 1:08:08.562
I had a lot of respect
for Leiter.

1:08:14.786 --> 1:08:17.571
Look, if you have information,
I'd be happy to receive it.

1:08:17.615 --> 1:08:19.617
-Get me into Belmarsh.
-No.

1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:22.185
Blofeld's the only member
of Spectre still breathing,

1:08:22.228 --> 1:08:23.621
-I can't risk that.
-Oh, but you will

1:08:23.664 --> 1:08:26.145
risk developing
a DNA-targeting weapon

1:08:26.189 --> 1:08:29.148
with a corrupt scientist
for ten years?

1:08:29.192 --> 1:08:31.324
There was nothing
to suggest that Obruchev

1:08:31.368 --> 1:08:33.326
was working for anyone else.
I had him--

1:08:33.370 --> 1:08:35.285
My God,
you're thirsty at the moment.

1:08:37.243 --> 1:08:40.159
You have no right
to speak to me that way.

1:08:40.203 --> 1:08:43.815
You have no right to make
insinuations about my judgment.

1:08:43.858 --> 1:08:48.167
If you've nothing left
to give, you are irrelevant.

1:08:48.211 --> 1:08:49.647
You've done your bit
and we thank you
for your service,

1:08:49.690 --> 1:08:52.128
again. Goodbye.

1:08:54.173 --> 1:08:56.610
-Moneypenny, send in 007.

1:08:56.654 --> 1:08:57.481
You can go, Bond.

1:09:05.141 --> 1:09:06.533
It's definitely the same desk.

1:09:11.495 --> 1:09:12.539
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:19.372
-Go to Belmarsh.

1:09:19.416 --> 1:09:21.983
I want everything
that Blofeld listens to,

1:09:22.027 --> 1:09:24.160
looks at and touches scanned.

1:09:24.203 --> 1:09:25.813
Scan every corner
of that cell.

1:09:25.857 --> 1:09:27.902
Scan the whole prison.

1:09:27.946 --> 1:09:30.688
In fact,
scan the whole damn man.

1:09:30.731 --> 1:09:33.169
Sir. I'll bring my gloves.

1:09:37.216 --> 1:09:39.175
James...
Uh...

1:09:41.699 --> 1:09:43.004
What are you doing for dinner?

1:10:05.026 --> 1:10:06.419
-

1:10:13.121 --> 1:10:14.993
-So, you're not dead?
-Hello, Q. I've missed you.

1:10:16.516 --> 1:10:18.518
Mm!
That smells great.

1:10:18.562 --> 1:10:20.259
-Were you expecting somebody?
-

1:10:20.303 --> 1:10:22.783
Um... No. What...
Excuse me.

1:10:24.045 --> 1:10:26.091
Oh.

1:10:26.134 --> 1:10:29.747
This is the first time I've...
He'll be here in 20 minutes,

1:10:29.790 --> 1:10:31.270
I can't take my focus off...

1:10:31.314 --> 1:10:33.011
I need you to tell me
what's on that.

1:10:33.054 --> 1:10:34.665
No, I need to lay the table.

1:10:38.799 --> 1:10:41.367
You know,
they come with fur these days.

1:10:41.411 --> 1:10:44.762
I want to be very clear
that I am not authorized
to help you.

1:10:44.805 --> 1:10:46.677
-And I have sworn...
-It's to do with Heracles.

1:10:49.897 --> 1:10:51.986
I presume M doesn't know
that this is happening.

1:10:52.030 --> 1:10:54.685
No, but there's something
going on, Q.

1:10:54.728 --> 1:10:55.642
We need to find out
what it is.

1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:03.302
Well, it's never
9:00 to 5:00, is it?

1:11:04.825 --> 1:11:06.436
Thank you.

1:11:11.745 --> 1:11:13.791
-Um, Bond?
- Yes?

1:11:13.834 --> 1:11:15.053
Do you know
where this has been?

1:11:15.096 --> 1:11:16.489
Everywhere, I should imagine.

1:11:18.099 --> 1:11:18.926
Into the sandbox.

1:11:23.931 --> 1:11:25.106
Oh. Thank you.

1:11:27.544 --> 1:11:29.589
- Um, it's a database.

1:11:29.633 --> 1:11:32.113
Don't touch that, please.

1:11:32.157 --> 1:11:33.506
What's the data?

1:11:33.550 --> 1:11:35.726
It's DNA.
Multiple individuals.

1:11:35.769 --> 1:11:37.510
What was M working on?

1:11:37.554 --> 1:11:39.251
Something he should have
shut down years ago.

1:11:39.295 --> 1:11:41.209
Oh, hello.
- What?

1:11:41.253 --> 1:11:43.386
There's more.
Hidden files.

1:11:43.429 --> 1:11:46.606
I was asked to recover
what I could

1:11:46.650 --> 1:11:49.261
from Obruchev's hard drive
just after the explosion,

1:11:49.305 --> 1:11:51.002
and I have
a pretty good feeling that...

1:11:51.045 --> 1:11:54.875
this is what was missing.
Yeah. A complete disk.

1:11:59.880 --> 1:12:02.405
So, Obruchev is working
for someone

1:12:02.448 --> 1:12:03.928
who managed
to kill all of Spectre?

1:12:03.971 --> 1:12:05.321
Not all of them.

1:12:07.061 --> 1:12:08.193
Blofeld.

1:12:08.236 --> 1:12:09.934
Can you show me
the other files?

1:12:09.977 --> 1:12:11.239
Mm-hmm.

1:12:16.810 --> 1:12:19.030
Wait,
this can't just be Spectre.

1:12:20.423 --> 1:12:23.991
Oh, my God.
There are thousands.

1:12:25.819 --> 1:12:26.559
Who are they?

1:12:28.039 --> 1:12:29.606
They're in categories.

1:12:29.649 --> 1:12:31.651
I'm gonna need
more time to organize...

1:12:31.695 --> 1:12:33.697
There have been, uh, breaches

1:12:33.740 --> 1:12:36.134
round the world of databases
holding DNA information.

1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:39.659
-We've been tracking them.
-Ours?

1:12:39.703 --> 1:12:41.008
I can't imagine
they're leaving us out,

1:12:41.052 --> 1:12:43.054
whoever they are.

1:12:43.097 --> 1:12:45.317
Well, Blofeld
will know who they are.

1:12:45.361 --> 1:12:46.405
Q, you need to get me
into Belmarsh.

1:12:49.234 --> 1:12:52.106
Well, there's only one person
he'll speak to.

1:12:52.150 --> 1:12:54.935
Who? M says no one has access.

1:12:54.979 --> 1:12:56.807
-Really?
-Did he?

1:12:56.850 --> 1:12:58.548
What's that?

1:13:00.463 --> 1:13:02.203
Can I just have
one nice evening, please,

1:13:02.247 --> 1:13:03.335
before the world explodes?

1:13:03.379 --> 1:13:05.555
Who has access? Who?

1:13:12.866 --> 1:13:14.520
Morning.
- Morning.

1:13:14.564 --> 1:13:17.349
New patient.
He's weird.

1:13:17.393 --> 1:13:18.959
You can't say that.

1:13:25.052 --> 1:13:26.010
I'm sorry I'm late.

1:13:28.882 --> 1:13:30.406
I wasn't expecting
a new patient.

1:13:35.498 --> 1:13:38.065
Sorry if I surprised you.

1:13:38.979 --> 1:13:40.851
No. I like surprises.

1:13:44.942 --> 1:13:47.901
You're very attractive
for a psychotherapist.

1:13:47.945 --> 1:13:49.816
Must be dangerous
for your clients.

1:13:54.734 --> 1:13:56.432
They are usually more
of a danger to themselves.

1:14:01.262 --> 1:14:02.438
Foxgloves.

1:14:03.090 --> 1:14:04.222
Beautiful.

1:14:05.789 --> 1:14:07.399
-Did you choose them?
-Yes.

1:14:07.443 --> 1:14:09.096
I found them friendly.

1:14:09.140 --> 1:14:10.968
You know if you eat them

1:14:11.011 --> 1:14:13.057
they can cause your heart
to just...

1:14:16.103 --> 1:14:17.061
stop.

1:14:18.366 --> 1:14:20.151
Then I'll make sure not to.

1:14:28.202 --> 1:14:29.247
Do you know a lot
about flowers?

1:14:29.290 --> 1:14:32.119
My father had a garden.

1:14:32.163 --> 1:14:33.512
He taught me.

1:14:33.556 --> 1:14:38.648
He died when I was young,
but my interest remained.

1:14:39.779 --> 1:14:41.041
It's difficult
to lose a parent.

1:14:43.566 --> 1:14:44.610
Especially at a young age.

1:14:45.742 --> 1:14:47.439
Yes,

1:14:47.483 --> 1:14:50.877
death has
a particular effect
on children,

1:14:52.488 --> 1:14:53.271
doesn't it?

1:14:56.492 --> 1:14:57.928
What effect
did it have on you?

1:14:58.798 --> 1:15:00.191
Profound.

1:15:00.234 --> 1:15:02.715
But I saved a life once.

1:15:04.587 --> 1:15:06.066
I think that had
more of an effect.

1:15:07.981 --> 1:15:09.200
Why is that?

1:15:09.243 --> 1:15:11.985
Saving someone's life

1:15:12.029 --> 1:15:15.772
connects you
to them forever,
the same as taking it.

1:15:17.861 --> 1:15:18.905
They belong to you.

1:15:24.041 --> 1:15:26.347
I'm not very good
at talking about myself,

1:15:26.391 --> 1:15:28.524
so I brought a memory box.

1:15:32.005 --> 1:15:34.704
I thought
it might interest you.

1:15:34.747 --> 1:15:37.750
Sometimes objects
can be more evocative
than memories.

1:15:49.762 --> 1:15:52.548
I never forgot your eyes
under the ice.

1:15:55.072 --> 1:15:56.247
They needed me.

1:15:58.945 --> 1:16:01.687
It is a shock to see them
so many years later.

1:16:04.385 --> 1:16:05.343
They still need me.

1:16:06.605 --> 1:16:09.173
I am rather taken by them.

1:16:09.216 --> 1:16:11.131
-What do you want?
-Just a favor.

1:16:12.568 --> 1:16:13.438
You owe me.

1:16:14.787 --> 1:16:16.615
You murdered my mother.

1:16:16.659 --> 1:16:19.400
And your father
killed my entire family.

1:16:22.142 --> 1:16:24.188
Parents.

1:16:24.231 --> 1:16:27.408
I need you to visit
someone for me,
wearing this.

1:16:29.236 --> 1:16:30.760
It's harmless to you.

1:16:35.678 --> 1:16:37.593
You are the only one
who can do it.

1:16:38.855 --> 1:16:39.769
No.

1:16:41.074 --> 1:16:43.163
Why would I do
anything for you?

1:16:43.207 --> 1:16:49.561
Because I am a man
willing to kill
the person you love most.

1:16:49.605 --> 1:16:51.650
I've already lost everyone
I've ever loved.

1:16:53.521 --> 1:16:54.871
There is nothing
you can threaten me with.

1:16:57.700 --> 1:16:59.832
That is very sad to hear,
Madeleine.

1:17:05.708 --> 1:17:06.970
But it is not true...

1:17:12.628 --> 1:17:13.672
is it?

1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:24.335
Madeleine Swann, really?

1:17:24.378 --> 1:17:26.946
Well, yes. We took
your information seriously,

1:17:26.990 --> 1:17:30.123
but that was five years ago.
Nothing came up.

1:17:30.167 --> 1:17:32.082
Well, she's very smart
and very good
at hiding things.

1:17:32.125 --> 1:17:33.474
She's a useful asset.

1:17:33.518 --> 1:17:36.477
She's the only psychiatrist
he agreed to speak to.

1:17:36.521 --> 1:17:37.957
I had to exercise
my judgment...

1:17:38.001 --> 1:17:39.045
Your judgment is the problem.

1:17:41.178 --> 1:17:43.571
That weapon was designed
to save lives

1:17:43.615 --> 1:17:45.878
and to eradicate
collateral damage
for our agents.

1:17:47.706 --> 1:17:49.708
A clean,
accurate shot every time.

1:17:51.101 --> 1:17:52.668
But it had to be off the books.

1:17:54.060 --> 1:17:56.236
There are enough holes
in our national security.

1:17:58.151 --> 1:17:59.979
If the world knows
what this can do...

1:18:00.023 --> 1:18:01.807
-They'd kill for it.
-Mm.

1:18:02.939 --> 1:18:03.853
Look...

1:18:06.246 --> 1:18:10.598
If it's an error,
it's on my shoulders,
fair and square.

1:18:12.992 --> 1:18:14.820
I've dedicated my life
to defending this country.

1:18:16.779 --> 1:18:19.085
I believe in defending
the principles of this...

1:18:19.129 --> 1:18:20.521
Of this.

1:18:22.872 --> 1:18:25.004
But we used to be able to get
into a room with the enemy,

1:18:25.048 --> 1:18:25.918
we could look him in the eye.

1:18:27.180 --> 1:18:28.094
And now the...

1:18:30.706 --> 1:18:33.970
The enemy
is just floating in the ether.

1:18:34.013 --> 1:18:34.927
We don't even know
what they're after.

1:18:36.189 --> 1:18:37.408
Blofeld.

1:18:39.236 --> 1:18:41.586
We managed to access
a database of their targets.

1:18:41.629 --> 1:18:42.718
"We"?

1:18:45.024 --> 1:18:46.112
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1:18:47.723 --> 1:18:48.767
I see.

1:18:50.421 --> 1:18:51.770
And after Blofeld,
what do they want?

1:18:53.511 --> 1:18:54.991
Well, it's hard to say.

1:18:55.034 --> 1:18:56.601
I mean,
I would imagine world leaders,

1:18:56.644 --> 1:18:59.778
innocent civilians, freedom,
you know, that sort of thing.

1:18:59.822 --> 1:19:02.476
Oh, good,
well, just the usual.

1:19:02.520 --> 1:19:04.217
Just the usual.

1:19:08.091 --> 1:19:11.007
Blofeld was communicating
with his agents in Cuba

1:19:11.050 --> 1:19:14.619
through a bionic eye
which we've now retrieved.

1:19:14.662 --> 1:19:17.187
You're welcome.

1:19:17.230 --> 1:19:21.278
Spectre's destruction's going
to have huge consequences.

1:19:21.321 --> 1:19:24.194
Whoever did this is going
to be very dangerous
and very powerful.

1:19:26.936 --> 1:19:29.416
We need all the information
that we can gather.

1:19:29.460 --> 1:19:30.678
Sir.

1:19:31.984 --> 1:19:32.768
Sir.

1:19:34.813 --> 1:19:36.859
Bond.

1:19:36.902 --> 1:19:39.644
So the rumors are true.
You look well.

1:19:39.687 --> 1:19:40.776
Tanner.

1:19:41.951 --> 1:19:43.474
Sir,
there's been a development.

1:19:45.998 --> 1:19:47.608
They were
just dropping,

1:19:47.652 --> 1:19:48.740
one right after the other.

1:19:48.784 --> 1:19:52.048
It was disturbing,
to say the least.

1:19:52.091 --> 1:19:54.528
Wait till you see
what it looks like up close.

1:19:54.572 --> 1:19:57.444
-Uh, Bond's in the office.
- What?

1:20:01.231 --> 1:20:04.756
Oh, Bond. My God,
I haven't seen you in,
in, uh...

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:06.584
-How is your retirement?
-Shut up, Q.

1:20:06.627 --> 1:20:08.455
I know he's staying with you.

1:20:08.499 --> 1:20:10.240
And you're not
in the clear either.

1:20:10.283 --> 1:20:12.242
-What happened?
-He's been reinstated
as a double-0.

1:20:14.940 --> 1:20:16.855
-Double-0 what?
-What have you got?

1:20:19.945 --> 1:20:21.686
Q has studied
the blood samples I gathered

1:20:21.729 --> 1:20:23.470
from the victims
of the funeral.

1:20:23.514 --> 1:20:25.559
Just look at this.

1:20:25.603 --> 1:20:27.605
- What are we looking at?

1:20:27.648 --> 1:20:28.954
This is the funeral

1:20:28.998 --> 1:20:31.565
of one of the dead
Spectre agents from Cuba.

1:20:31.609 --> 1:20:33.437
And here are
the members of their family

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:36.570
who made physical contact
with the corpse.

1:20:36.614 --> 1:20:39.008
We found Heracles
in the blood samples
of all of them.

1:20:41.401 --> 1:20:43.273
Now,
that's some good work, Nomi.

1:20:43.316 --> 1:20:45.275
Thank you, sir. Double-0 what?

1:20:45.318 --> 1:20:48.626
-What are they?
-They're... They're nanobots.

1:20:50.193 --> 1:20:51.629
Right.

1:20:51.672 --> 1:20:53.979
Microscopic bio-robots
that can enter your system

1:20:54.023 --> 1:20:55.415
by the slightest contact
with your skin.

1:21:01.334 --> 1:21:05.121
Programmed with DNA
to target specific individuals.

1:21:06.426 --> 1:21:07.863
Heracles was...

1:21:09.777 --> 1:21:13.738
It was designed to be
the most efficient weapon
in our arsenal.

1:21:13.781 --> 1:21:15.740
Passing through
people harmlessly

1:21:15.783 --> 1:21:18.090
before reaching
its intended target.

1:21:18.134 --> 1:21:20.397
But Obruchev
modified the nanobots

1:21:20.440 --> 1:21:22.573
so that they can kill anyone
related to the target.

1:21:22.616 --> 1:21:24.488
-Anyone?
-Well, since it's DNA-based,

1:21:24.531 --> 1:21:25.924
with further modifications,
yes.

1:21:26.925 --> 1:21:30.102
Families,
certain genetic traits.

1:21:30.146 --> 1:21:32.844
Single-nucleotide variants
and polymorphisms

1:21:32.888 --> 1:21:35.542
that could target a range
from individuals to...

1:21:35.586 --> 1:21:36.892
whole ethnicities.

1:21:37.762 --> 1:21:39.329
You infect enough people...

1:21:39.372 --> 1:21:41.418
And the people
become the weapon.

1:21:41.461 --> 1:21:44.029
It was never intended to be
a weapon of mass destruction.

1:21:46.162 --> 1:21:46.945
It was...

1:21:49.905 --> 1:21:51.297
I need to call
the Prime Minister.

1:21:52.690 --> 1:21:55.127
Tanner, quarantine
the families from the funeral.

1:21:55.171 --> 1:21:56.737
-Yes, sir.
- And, Q,

1:21:56.781 --> 1:21:58.739
hack into Blofeld's bionic eye,

1:21:58.783 --> 1:21:59.915
see what you can find.

1:22:01.568 --> 1:22:03.266
-You've got your wish.

1:22:03.309 --> 1:22:06.095
Go to Blofeld and see
what you can get out of him.

1:22:06.138 --> 1:22:08.097
And find
that cockroach Obruchev.

1:22:09.011 --> 1:22:10.055
Sir.

1:22:13.754 --> 1:22:16.235
We don't have a trail.

1:22:16.279 --> 1:22:19.673
Logan Ash. State Department.
Ex-State Department.

1:22:19.717 --> 1:22:21.545
Find him,
you'll find Obruchev.

1:22:21.588 --> 1:22:22.807
Um...

1:22:23.982 --> 1:22:25.462
Good luck.

1:22:25.505 --> 1:22:27.768
Thanks.

1:22:53.881 --> 1:22:55.057
I'll be outside
when you're done

1:22:55.100 --> 1:22:56.623
with your important
preparation.

1:22:59.626 --> 1:23:00.627
I'll be just a moment.

1:23:02.064 --> 1:23:03.065
It's fine.

1:23:22.736 --> 1:23:24.347
Blofeld's eyeball unlocked.

1:23:29.134 --> 1:23:31.919
Accessing
received media stream.

1:23:33.051 --> 1:23:35.271
I know you
and she have a history,

1:23:35.314 --> 1:23:38.491
but we've kept a close eye
on her over the years.

1:23:38.535 --> 1:23:40.015
She's been very compliant.

1:23:40.058 --> 1:23:41.538
If Bond does
anything weird in there,

1:23:41.581 --> 1:23:43.105
you'll be doing me
a huge favor,

1:23:43.148 --> 1:23:45.194
so don't make it too easy
for him, okay?

1:23:45.237 --> 1:23:46.717
Okay.

1:23:46.760 --> 1:23:49.850
He's the most valuable asset
this country has.

1:23:49.894 --> 1:23:51.635
I know you and he
have a history,

1:23:51.678 --> 1:23:54.725
but don't let him get
in your head.

1:23:54.768 --> 1:23:56.335
If you feel yourself
losing control...

1:23:56.379 --> 1:23:59.469
Oh, Tanner, relax.

1:23:59.512 --> 1:24:00.818
I'm not gonna lose...

1:24:05.823 --> 1:24:07.085
control.

1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:14.788
Dr. Swann, good afternoon.

1:24:20.533 --> 1:24:21.839
Mr. Bond.

1:24:26.322 --> 1:24:27.627
007.

1:24:32.676 --> 1:24:35.766
Six-seven.
Special cell two
now locked off.

1:24:40.988 --> 1:24:43.339
Segregation unit secure.

1:24:43.382 --> 1:24:45.776
This is where we leave you.
Good luck.

1:24:45.819 --> 1:24:47.125
Just get us a name.

1:24:54.654 --> 1:24:58.136
Must be nice to catch up
with an old friend
so regularly.

1:25:00.138 --> 1:25:02.401
-We're closer than ever.
-

1:25:02.445 --> 1:25:04.316
Oh, that was awkward.

1:25:04.360 --> 1:25:05.752
Does he have that effect
on all women?

1:25:05.796 --> 1:25:08.103
Fifty-fifty.

1:25:08.146 --> 1:25:09.104
-It's unpredictable.
-Huh.

1:25:12.455 --> 1:25:14.109
Isolated in HSU.

1:25:23.205 --> 1:25:24.206
You're shaking.

1:25:25.946 --> 1:25:27.513
It's not an ideal situation.

1:25:57.717 --> 1:25:59.154
Open the door.

1:26:00.459 --> 1:26:01.373
Open the door!

1:26:02.896 --> 1:26:04.724
-Don't.
-What is it?

1:26:06.248 --> 1:26:09.207
James,
you don't know what this is.

1:26:10.469 --> 1:26:11.775
Don't make me do this.

1:26:11.818 --> 1:26:13.690
Please.

1:26:13.733 --> 1:26:14.908
Right. Open the doors.

1:26:14.952 --> 1:26:16.649
-Open the door.
-Open it.

1:26:16.693 --> 1:26:17.824
What...

1:26:21.219 --> 1:26:22.220
Where are you going?

1:26:23.569 --> 1:26:24.614
Home.

1:26:28.705 --> 1:26:30.402
I'll get her.
- Wait.

1:26:30.446 --> 1:26:32.404
-He won't talk without her.
-Just wait.

1:26:34.928 --> 1:26:35.668
Special delivery.

1:26:52.729 --> 1:26:53.251
James.

1:26:54.557 --> 1:26:55.210
Hello, Blofeld.

1:26:57.995 --> 1:27:00.432
Perhaps you can help me.

1:27:02.913 --> 1:27:04.697
Cuba was quite the party.

1:27:04.741 --> 1:27:07.483
-Happy birthday, by the way.
-Thank you.

1:27:07.526 --> 1:27:09.398
I'm trying to piece together
what happened.

1:27:11.095 --> 1:27:13.228
I mean, there you were,
or here you were,

1:27:13.271 --> 1:27:15.665
with the world's
most powerful people,

1:27:15.708 --> 1:27:19.669
your friends, all in one room,
a noose around my neck,

1:27:19.712 --> 1:27:22.237
and your hands on the most
valuable weapon in existence.

1:27:23.890 --> 1:27:26.110
It's like a...

1:27:26.153 --> 1:27:29.766
It was like a testimony
to your greatness.

1:27:29.809 --> 1:27:34.205
A celebration of all
that is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

1:27:34.249 --> 1:27:36.076
Yeah, James.
-

1:27:37.687 --> 1:27:39.776
Yeah.

1:27:39.819 --> 1:27:42.257
But then it all went wrong,
didn't it?

1:27:44.302 --> 1:27:47.523
My sweet James,
what do you want?

1:27:47.566 --> 1:27:48.959
Your enemies
are closing in, Blofeld.

1:27:50.830 --> 1:27:52.484
And the biggest twist here

1:27:52.528 --> 1:27:54.530
is that if you tell me
who they are,

1:27:55.966 --> 1:27:57.576
I could save your life.

1:27:57.620 --> 1:28:00.753
Mm, my avenging angel.

1:28:00.797 --> 1:28:03.278
My chaser of lost causes.

1:28:03.321 --> 1:28:06.281
Now you even chase mine.

1:28:06.324 --> 1:28:08.108
But you're asking
the wrong question.

1:28:08.152 --> 1:28:10.720
Yeah,
Cuba was a disappointment,

1:28:10.763 --> 1:28:13.505
but we all cry on our birthday.

1:28:13.549 --> 1:28:15.333
You need to ask yourself,

1:28:15.377 --> 1:28:17.814
why are we here?

1:28:17.857 --> 1:28:20.295
Accessing media file 472.

1:28:22.209 --> 1:28:24.299
Hmm. Looking sharp, Bond.

1:28:24.342 --> 1:28:25.561
473.

1:28:26.953 --> 1:28:28.303
474.

1:28:29.739 --> 1:28:31.523
475.

1:28:33.351 --> 1:28:36.528
476, 477, 478.

1:28:40.793 --> 1:28:42.317
479.

1:28:50.368 --> 1:28:52.762
Logan Ash.
A pleasure to meet you.

1:28:52.805 --> 1:28:54.024
Oh, my God, that's him.

1:28:54.067 --> 1:28:55.765
I am sorry
for your loss.

1:28:55.808 --> 1:28:58.550
I believe you know
who I represent and work for?

1:28:58.594 --> 1:29:00.813
We have an opportunity for you.

1:29:02.032 --> 1:29:03.120
You keep
coming back to me.

1:29:03.163 --> 1:29:04.774
I thought
I'd never see you again,

1:29:04.817 --> 1:29:06.297
but fate draws
us back together.

1:29:06.341 --> 1:29:08.560
Yes. Q's got eyes on Logan Ash.

1:29:09.692 --> 1:29:10.954
-Go.
-Yep.

1:29:10.997 --> 1:29:12.434
Let me know what happens.

1:29:12.477 --> 1:29:13.913
Now your enemy
is my enemy.

1:29:13.957 --> 1:29:15.393
How did that happen?

1:29:15.437 --> 1:29:17.656
Well, you live long enough...

1:29:17.700 --> 1:29:20.311
Yeah. Look at us.
-

1:29:20.355 --> 1:29:21.791
Two old men in a hole

1:29:21.834 --> 1:29:23.836
trying to work out
who's playing tricks on us.

1:29:27.666 --> 1:29:30.452
She still loves you.
Did you know that?

1:29:30.495 --> 1:29:32.410
And you broke her heart.
And she betrayed you.

1:29:32.454 --> 1:29:34.194
She is irrelevant.

1:29:34.238 --> 1:29:37.720
Mm, I wouldn't be
so quick to dismiss.

1:29:37.763 --> 1:29:40.810
You said it yourself,
she's very good
at hiding things.

1:29:40.853 --> 1:29:45.205
And when her secret
finds its way out,
and it will,

1:29:45.249 --> 1:29:46.642
it'll be the death of you.

1:29:46.685 --> 1:29:48.818
Just give me a name.

1:29:48.861 --> 1:29:50.646
-Madeleine.
-

1:29:50.689 --> 1:29:53.518
Please, just...
Please, no games.

1:29:55.172 --> 1:29:56.216
Madeleine.

1:29:58.567 --> 1:30:01.134
Oh, do you know what?
The two of you
should come see me.

1:30:01.178 --> 1:30:03.485
A little couples therapy.

1:30:03.528 --> 1:30:06.357
I simply have to see your face
when she tells you the truth.

1:30:06.401 --> 1:30:09.578
Just tell me
who they are, Blofeld...

1:30:11.928 --> 1:30:14.278
and then I'll leave.
I'll leave you on your own.

1:30:14.321 --> 1:30:16.411
No, I don't want you to leave.

1:30:16.454 --> 1:30:17.629
We're just getting
reacquainted.

1:30:24.114 --> 1:30:25.811
Hmm. All right. Come.

1:30:27.596 --> 1:30:31.077
You were unusually patient.
I need to give you something

1:30:31.121 --> 1:30:33.428
so that you didn't have to make
all this way for nothing. Come.

1:30:39.956 --> 1:30:40.696
Careful, Bond.

1:30:41.914 --> 1:30:42.480
It was me.

1:30:44.700 --> 1:30:47.180
-You destroyed Spectre?
- No.

1:30:47.224 --> 1:30:49.487
Vesper's grave.

1:30:49.531 --> 1:30:51.315
Madeleine didn't do a thing.
It was all me.

1:30:51.358 --> 1:30:53.578
I knew you'd come visit it,

1:30:53.622 --> 1:30:56.363
I just needed to wait
for the bon moment.

1:30:56.407 --> 1:30:57.756
She led you straight there

1:30:57.800 --> 1:30:59.932
from the goodness
of her heart.

1:30:59.976 --> 1:31:02.935
And then you left her, for me.

1:31:02.979 --> 1:31:05.285
-It doesn't matter.
-Oh, but it does.

1:31:05.329 --> 1:31:07.070
She still does, doesn't she?

1:31:07.113 --> 1:31:09.289
My poor little cuckoo.

1:31:10.769 --> 1:31:13.642
You were always so very,
very sensitive.

1:31:17.123 --> 1:31:18.081
This isn't working.

1:31:18.124 --> 1:31:19.474
Keep going.

1:31:19.517 --> 1:31:21.301
All this wasted time,

1:31:21.345 --> 1:31:23.434
the life you could have had.

1:31:23.478 --> 1:31:26.132
And the reason all of this
is so beautiful,

1:31:26.176 --> 1:31:28.221
so exquisitely beautiful,

1:31:28.265 --> 1:31:30.746
is that you're coming
to me looking for answers,

1:31:30.789 --> 1:31:33.792
whereas the one person
who knows it all is she.

1:31:33.836 --> 1:31:37.361
It's Madeleine. She holds
the secrets you need.

1:31:37.404 --> 1:31:40.016
All of them.
I didn't need to kill you.

1:31:40.059 --> 1:31:41.670
I'd already broken you.

1:31:41.713 --> 1:31:43.759
I wanted to give you
an empty world...

1:31:45.325 --> 1:31:47.589
like the one you gave me.

1:31:47.632 --> 1:31:49.373
It's enough
to almost make me regret it.

1:31:50.766 --> 1:31:51.680
Eh, almost.

1:32:00.297 --> 1:32:01.080
Die.

1:32:03.039 --> 1:32:03.648
Hmm?

1:32:06.564 --> 1:32:08.697
Die, Blofeld. Die.
-

1:32:08.740 --> 1:32:10.089
Jesus. Open the door.

1:32:12.048 --> 1:32:14.659
-Bond! Bond! Bond!

1:32:14.703 --> 1:32:18.533
-Open the door. Bond!

1:32:18.576 --> 1:32:20.230
-Cuckoo.
-

1:32:20.273 --> 1:32:21.536
What the hell
are you thinking?

1:32:21.579 --> 1:32:23.146
Yes, yes, yes, I know how
to interrogate an asset.

1:32:23.189 --> 1:32:26.018
-This interrogation is over.
-Tanner, don't lecture me!

1:32:26.062 --> 1:32:28.412
Bond, you have violated
the most important rule

1:32:28.455 --> 1:32:29.935
in the whole bloody playbook.

1:32:36.638 --> 1:32:37.639
Don't move.

1:32:47.997 --> 1:32:49.781
I'm... I'm gonna need those,
I'm afraid.

1:33:01.837 --> 1:33:02.577
He's dead.

1:33:05.231 --> 1:33:07.451
It's a good thing
you're not actually related,

1:33:07.494 --> 1:33:08.583
or you'd be dead too.

1:33:10.236 --> 1:33:12.369
-How do I get this off?
- Oh, you don't. You can't.

1:33:14.501 --> 1:33:17.548
Nanobots aren't just
for Christmas.

1:33:17.592 --> 1:33:21.508
Once Heracles
is in your system,
it's there forever.

1:33:27.297 --> 1:33:28.777
Did they find the car?

1:33:28.820 --> 1:33:30.822
We traced it,
but she abandoned it.

1:33:30.866 --> 1:33:32.737
They searched her flat,
she hasn't been home.

1:33:34.391 --> 1:33:36.567
-Is she one of them?
-I don't know.

1:33:36.611 --> 1:33:40.397
James, do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

1:33:42.268 --> 1:33:44.270
No. I don't know her at all.

1:34:31.187 --> 1:34:32.579
Is that for me?

1:34:34.930 --> 1:34:35.931
No.

1:34:38.977 --> 1:34:40.326
Then why did you come?

1:34:41.588 --> 1:34:42.894
Because you told me to.

1:34:44.766 --> 1:34:47.333
I didn't think you
would remember.

1:34:47.377 --> 1:34:49.292
I remember everything.

1:34:49.335 --> 1:34:51.686
You need to tell me
who gave you
the poison, Madeleine.

1:34:53.905 --> 1:34:54.906
Is he dead?

1:34:56.299 --> 1:34:57.343
Yes, he's dead.

1:34:58.475 --> 1:34:59.694
Good.

1:35:02.697 --> 1:35:03.872
He told me
you didn't betray me.

1:35:06.439 --> 1:35:07.876
I understand you're not built
to trust people.

1:35:10.269 --> 1:35:13.185
-Neither are you.
-Then we were fools
for trying.

1:35:14.360 --> 1:35:15.710
I wanted to.

1:35:22.934 --> 1:35:24.849
I don't know if you wanted me
to come here,

1:35:26.721 --> 1:35:28.331
or why you tried
to kill Blofeld,

1:35:28.374 --> 1:35:29.811
or who gave you
the poison to do it,

1:35:29.854 --> 1:35:30.986
or how long you've been
working for them,

1:35:31.029 --> 1:35:32.378
but I do know...

1:35:35.251 --> 1:35:39.690
that for what felt
like five minutes of my life

1:35:39.734 --> 1:35:41.823
I wanted everything with you.

1:35:44.651 --> 1:35:46.741
And it's not
because I didn't trust.

1:35:49.744 --> 1:35:51.441
It was just that feeling.

1:35:56.315 --> 1:35:58.753
I know I've come here
to find out who gave you
the poison.

1:36:00.842 --> 1:36:02.757
But I'm not going to leave here
without you knowing

1:36:04.323 --> 1:36:05.977
that I have loved you,

1:36:07.587 --> 1:36:09.589
and I will love you,

1:36:09.633 --> 1:36:13.419
and I do not regret
a single moment of my life

1:36:13.463 --> 1:36:14.551
that led me to you.

1:36:17.815 --> 1:36:19.251
Except when I put you
on that train.

1:36:24.561 --> 1:36:25.780
Do you know
the worst thing about you?

1:36:28.130 --> 1:36:29.218
My timing?

1:36:31.829 --> 1:36:32.787
Don't.

1:36:41.534 --> 1:36:43.580
My sense of humor?

1:36:45.103 --> 1:36:45.974
Don't.

1:36:50.326 --> 1:36:52.763
-What?
-You look...

1:36:52.807 --> 1:36:54.025
You look incredible.

1:37:06.733 --> 1:37:08.474
This is Mathilde.

1:37:10.302 --> 1:37:11.651
Um...

1:37:12.522 --> 1:37:14.219
Hello. I'm James.

1:37:31.976 --> 1:37:35.850
Sir, we've located Logan Ash.
007 wants a word.

1:37:35.893 --> 1:37:37.852
-Well done, 007.
-Thank you, sir.

1:37:37.895 --> 1:37:39.810
Permission
for a capture or kill.

1:37:39.854 --> 1:37:41.072
Have we cleared this
with the Americans?

1:37:42.769 --> 1:37:44.902
Granted.
And thank you for asking.

1:37:44.946 --> 1:37:47.122
By the book, sir.

1:37:47.165 --> 1:37:48.863
Well, your predecessor
was less deferential.

1:37:50.125 --> 1:37:53.911
To be fair,
Commander Bond
gave me the lead.

1:37:53.955 --> 1:37:56.348
Well, I'm glad to see you two
getting along.

1:37:56.392 --> 1:37:57.872
-Sir.
-

1:37:57.915 --> 1:37:58.916
Have you located Dr. Swann?

1:38:00.352 --> 1:38:02.093
Nothing, I'm afraid, sir.

1:38:02.137 --> 1:38:02.877
Thank you.

1:38:33.211 --> 1:38:34.038
She's not yours.

1:38:36.127 --> 1:38:37.433
But, um, the...

1:38:37.476 --> 1:38:38.738
Okay, the blue eyes, the...

1:38:40.392 --> 1:38:41.698
She's not yours.

1:38:44.222 --> 1:38:44.962
Okay.

1:38:46.746 --> 1:38:47.704
I have something to show you.

1:38:51.403 --> 1:38:52.796
Another child?

1:39:04.503 --> 1:39:07.332
What is it
with your dad
and secret rooms?

1:39:07.376 --> 1:39:08.072
Talk to me.

1:39:09.813 --> 1:39:10.945
I wanted
to bring you here before.

1:39:12.642 --> 1:39:13.948
To tell you everything.

1:39:15.601 --> 1:39:17.125
Blofeld ordered my father

1:39:17.168 --> 1:39:18.953
to assassinate this family.

1:39:18.996 --> 1:39:20.650
The boy survived.

1:39:22.782 --> 1:39:23.958
His name is Lyutsifer Safin.

1:39:28.658 --> 1:39:30.965
When I was a little girl,
he came here
to kill my father.

1:39:33.184 --> 1:39:35.012
But he found me
and my mother instead.

1:39:37.667 --> 1:39:38.363
He spared my life.

1:39:40.975 --> 1:39:42.802
And now he's back.

1:39:42.846 --> 1:39:45.196
-And what does he want?
-Revenge.

1:39:47.546 --> 1:39:48.547
Me.

1:39:54.640 --> 1:39:57.426
-Who were they?
-Spectre's poisoners.

1:39:57.469 --> 1:39:59.515
My father held
a banquet for them,

1:39:59.558 --> 1:40:02.170
used their own recipe
in the dessert.

1:40:02.213 --> 1:40:03.084
Dioxin.

1:40:04.999 --> 1:40:06.957
They would have
suffered horribly.

1:40:07.001 --> 1:40:08.132
Scarred him for life.

1:40:09.873 --> 1:40:11.048
The family had an island.

1:40:12.919 --> 1:40:15.009
They called it
the Poison Garden.

1:40:16.358 --> 1:40:17.968
Oh, so...

1:40:18.012 --> 1:40:20.231
Blofeld took it from them,
and kept running it,

1:40:22.016 --> 1:40:23.800
and now this Safin
has taken it back.

1:40:29.806 --> 1:40:33.288
Q, find one Lyutsifer Safin.

1:40:33.331 --> 1:40:35.855
Whereabouts unknown
and no recent photographs,

1:40:35.899 --> 1:40:38.554
but I'm gonna send you
some images of him as a boy.

1:40:38.597 --> 1:40:42.558
And a picture of an island.
So, you know, do your best.

1:40:42.601 --> 1:40:45.039
And I'm gonna need a plane
to get there, a big one.

1:40:49.130 --> 1:40:50.522
I'll send you
my location shortly.

1:40:55.310 --> 1:40:56.833
You're going to find him?

1:40:59.575 --> 1:41:02.447
There are a thousand reasons
why we need to find this man.

1:41:04.971 --> 1:41:07.061
You just gave me a reason
to kill him.

1:41:42.966 --> 1:41:43.488
How is it?

1:41:58.199 --> 1:41:59.722
Excuse me.

1:41:59.765 --> 1:42:01.158
-Yes?
-Bond.

1:42:01.202 --> 1:42:02.812
Did you find the island?

1:42:02.855 --> 1:42:05.075
Yes, it's part of a chain

1:42:05.119 --> 1:42:07.425
in disputed waters
between Japan and Russia.

1:42:07.469 --> 1:42:11.342
There's a chemical plant
dating back
to the Second World War,

1:42:11.386 --> 1:42:12.909
seems to have had
quite a history.

1:42:12.952 --> 1:42:15.346
Sir, Japanese intelligence

1:42:15.390 --> 1:42:17.435
have reported suspicious
activity on the island.

1:42:17.479 --> 1:42:21.178
Q, bring up
the satellite images
I just sent through.

1:42:21.222 --> 1:42:22.832
These were taken
over the last few days.

1:42:25.922 --> 1:42:28.881
-If that is Safin there...
-Then Heracles is there too.

1:42:28.925 --> 1:42:30.579
Where do you need
this plane, Bond?

1:42:30.622 --> 1:42:33.582
Hang on, Q. Did 007 manage
to locate Logan Ash?

1:42:33.625 --> 1:42:36.150
She's closing in on him.
I'll send you her location.

1:42:44.506 --> 1:42:47.161
I thought she
was following Logan Ash,
not me.

1:42:47.204 --> 1:42:48.684
What? She is.

1:42:48.727 --> 1:42:50.207
James, where are you?

1:42:55.299 --> 1:42:56.561
Put her in the back.

1:42:58.259 --> 1:42:59.999
There you are.
In here. Watch your head.

1:43:14.362 --> 1:43:16.973
Q, I am gonna
need that plane, quickly.

1:43:17.016 --> 1:43:18.409
I'm near Orland NATO base.

1:43:18.453 --> 1:43:19.889
You think
you can get it to me?

1:43:19.932 --> 1:43:21.412
Right. Right, yes.
We'll be there.

1:43:21.456 --> 1:43:24.285
-Thank you.
- Mama.

1:44:29.611 --> 1:44:30.916
James.

1:44:44.365 --> 1:44:45.279
- Mathilde!

1:45:54.652 --> 1:45:55.392
They're above us!

1:46:23.420 --> 1:46:25.379
Get out of here! James!

1:47:34.752 --> 1:47:36.667
-

1:47:45.284 --> 1:47:46.503
-

1:48:03.172 --> 1:48:04.129
You stay here.

1:48:05.130 --> 1:48:07.568
I'll be back soon.

1:48:07.611 --> 1:48:10.048
Anybody comes through
that door, you shoot them.

1:48:10.092 --> 1:48:10.875
Unless it's me.

1:48:12.790 --> 1:48:14.662
You be quiet, okay?
Stay really quiet.

1:49:02.448 --> 1:49:04.407
-

1:49:47.668 --> 1:49:48.669
Go! Go!

1:49:55.676 --> 1:49:56.459
There! Run him over!

1:50:27.838 --> 1:50:29.797
You won't be able
to stop him...

1:50:32.495 --> 1:50:34.628
...so why don't you help
me out, brother?

1:50:34.671 --> 1:50:35.803
I had a brother.

1:50:38.501 --> 1:50:39.676
His name was Felix Leiter.

1:52:02.628 --> 1:52:03.151
Need a ride?

1:52:04.761 --> 1:52:06.545
Where have you been?

1:52:06.589 --> 1:52:08.547
Chasing after your lead.

1:52:11.986 --> 1:52:13.944
-Ash?
-Dead.

1:52:17.208 --> 1:52:18.296
They took Dr. Swann.

1:52:19.428 --> 1:52:20.734
And her daughter.

1:52:23.258 --> 1:52:26.304
I... I didn't know
she had a daughter.

1:52:26.348 --> 1:52:27.741
Did M get my plane?

1:52:29.307 --> 1:52:31.657
Our plane.
I'm coming with you.

1:52:34.399 --> 1:52:35.966
Thank you, 007.

1:52:59.685 --> 1:53:01.949
-Hello, Q.
- Bond.

1:53:03.864 --> 1:53:04.995
Sorry to get you
out of bed.

1:53:07.345 --> 1:53:10.044
The objectives
of this mission are threefold.

1:53:10.087 --> 1:53:12.307
Confirm the presence
of Heracles.

1:53:12.350 --> 1:53:14.309
Kill Obruchev and Safin.

1:53:14.352 --> 1:53:17.486
Get Dr. Swann and her daughter
off the island.

1:53:17.529 --> 1:53:20.315
And, Bond,
I hope they're there.

1:53:20.358 --> 1:53:22.665
-Thank you, sir.
-Sir.

1:53:25.233 --> 1:53:27.975
Permission for Commander Bond
to be redesignated as 007.

1:53:31.413 --> 1:53:32.370
It's just a number.

1:53:32.414 --> 1:53:33.937
Very well. Agreed.

1:53:35.634 --> 1:53:37.114
Good luck.

1:53:37.158 --> 1:53:38.724
Bond, your watch.

1:53:41.945 --> 1:53:46.080
It contains a limited-radius
electromagnetic pulse.

1:53:46.123 --> 1:53:48.256
It'll short any circuit
in a hardwired network

1:53:48.299 --> 1:53:49.823
-if you get close enough.
- Mm-hmm.

1:53:51.650 --> 1:53:52.869
And how strong is it?

1:53:53.870 --> 1:53:56.438
It's fairly strong.

1:53:56.481 --> 1:53:58.092
"Fairly strong,"
what's that mean?

1:53:58.135 --> 1:54:00.050
We haven't had the chance
to test it properly,
just be careful.

1:54:01.312 --> 1:54:03.532
Right, this is Q-DAR.

1:54:03.575 --> 1:54:05.055
It will map the space
as you move through it.

1:54:07.928 --> 1:54:08.842
Don't touch that.

1:54:10.582 --> 1:54:13.542
And smart blood
will track you...

1:54:13.585 --> 1:54:15.283
Whoops. And your vitals.

1:54:22.333 --> 1:54:25.032
Bond, you don't mind
a shot or two
whilst at work?

1:54:25.075 --> 1:54:26.511
-Shall we?
-Well, I haven't had a drink

1:54:26.555 --> 1:54:28.165
for three or four hou...

1:54:28.209 --> 1:54:30.080
-Hours.
-Wow.

1:54:30.124 --> 1:54:32.691
Doesn't sound like you.

1:54:35.390 --> 1:54:37.696
-Ow!
-Good.

1:54:37.740 --> 1:54:39.307
I assume you know
how the stealthy bird works.

1:54:39.350 --> 1:54:40.786
No, no idea.

1:54:41.526 --> 1:54:42.527
Gravity.

1:55:03.113 --> 1:55:04.810
Welcome back, Mr. Safin.

1:55:05.724 --> 1:55:07.901
Welcome to your family.

1:55:07.944 --> 1:55:09.728
How are you progressing?

1:55:09.772 --> 1:55:11.774
So, so good, Mr. Safin.
So, so good.

1:55:11.817 --> 1:55:15.082
-My request?
-Svetlana?

1:55:23.525 --> 1:55:25.919
Continue.

1:55:25.962 --> 1:55:27.877
-What is that?
-Insurance.

1:55:27.921 --> 1:55:30.227
A simple hair falls
from your head

1:55:30.271 --> 1:55:31.750
and now I have your life
in my hands.

1:55:34.231 --> 1:55:35.102
And yours.

1:55:37.452 --> 1:55:39.976
How damaged you must be
to threaten a little girl.

1:55:41.804 --> 1:55:43.414
You're any less damaged?

1:55:44.981 --> 1:55:46.069
You love a killer.

1:55:48.202 --> 1:55:51.988
You bore his child
despite his rejection.

1:55:52.032 --> 1:55:53.990
You've hidden
and lied your whole life.

1:55:54.034 --> 1:55:56.558
You will do anything...

1:55:56.601 --> 1:55:57.341
To survive.

1:56:01.955 --> 1:56:03.957
You understand me
the same way I understand you.

1:56:07.438 --> 1:56:08.222
Move.

1:56:18.493 --> 1:56:20.016
My father's garden.

1:56:20.060 --> 1:56:22.714
It was his toxic treasure.

1:56:22.758 --> 1:56:24.847
Let me show her.

1:56:24.890 --> 1:56:27.110
-Give her to me.
-No.

1:56:29.634 --> 1:56:30.896
I can protect her.

1:56:34.988 --> 1:56:36.424
Mathilde.

1:56:45.694 --> 1:56:47.391
Mathilde.

1:56:47.435 --> 1:56:49.176
It's a poison garden...

1:56:50.742 --> 1:56:52.396
but it's perfectly safe.

1:56:54.833 --> 1:56:57.314
My father made this.

1:56:57.358 --> 1:57:00.665
He loved his plants so much,
he would sing to them.

1:57:04.321 --> 1:57:05.801
I want to show you
one of my favorites.

1:57:10.284 --> 1:57:13.069
Some of these plants
are very dangerous,

1:57:13.113 --> 1:57:15.289
but not all of them
are for hurting people.

1:57:15.332 --> 1:57:18.118
I have plants that can do
all sorts of things.

1:57:24.950 --> 1:57:26.126
Mathilde!

1:57:27.301 --> 1:57:28.084
No.

1:57:30.043 --> 1:57:31.609
This one makes you do
as you're told,

1:57:33.133 --> 1:57:34.743
so you never misbehave,

1:57:34.786 --> 1:57:36.353
and you're always good.

1:57:36.397 --> 1:57:38.051
You mustn't misbehave,
Mathilde.

1:57:40.009 --> 1:57:41.184
And neither must your mother.

1:57:44.057 --> 1:57:45.058
Ever.

1:57:48.713 --> 1:57:50.628
-Do you like it here?
- No.

1:57:52.108 --> 1:57:53.240
Well, you will learn to.

1:57:54.545 --> 1:57:55.546
I grew up here,

1:57:55.590 --> 1:57:56.765
and you will too.

1:58:00.986 --> 1:58:02.292
Such a beautiful child.

1:58:05.556 --> 1:58:06.862
Perhaps we should
have some tea.

1:58:06.905 --> 1:58:08.733
-No.
-Make her see the light.

1:58:08.777 --> 1:58:10.561
No,
you can't separate us!

1:58:10.605 --> 1:58:11.736
-Mathilde!
-Mama!

1:58:17.438 --> 1:58:18.308
Don't worry.

1:58:20.789 --> 1:58:21.790
You have me.

1:58:31.756 --> 1:58:33.802
As soon as you have
a line of sight on the island,

1:58:33.845 --> 1:58:35.543
drop altitude,
stay below radar.

1:58:40.852 --> 1:58:42.115
You ever flown
one of these things before?

1:58:43.638 --> 1:58:44.508
Nope.

1:58:51.602 --> 1:58:53.430
Don't forget
to release the chute,

1:58:53.474 --> 1:58:55.215
and open the wings.

1:58:55.258 --> 1:58:56.172
Gravity isn't always
your friend.

1:59:13.233 --> 1:59:15.191
Look for a concrete structure
on the west side
of the island.

1:59:16.584 --> 1:59:17.846
That's your best bet
for getting in.

2:00:04.501 --> 2:00:06.721
Coming up for air, Q.

2:00:06.764 --> 2:00:08.505
Right, good.

2:00:08.549 --> 2:00:11.378
You should be entering
a World War II-era sub pen.

2:00:13.118 --> 2:00:14.381
Doesn't seem
to get much activity,

2:00:14.424 --> 2:00:15.773
but look out
for cameras anyway.

2:00:17.035 --> 2:00:18.385
Use your watch, Bond.

2:00:53.985 --> 2:00:55.378
Okay. Ah, there you go.

2:00:57.119 --> 2:01:00.165
-Sir, they're in.
-Yes, we have it.

2:01:00.209 --> 2:01:02.820
You should be able
to see the chemical plant's
architecture.

2:01:02.864 --> 2:01:05.823
Which one's Bond?
- He's the... He's the psi.

2:01:05.867 --> 2:01:08.913
-He's the trident thingy.
- Give us the layout.

2:01:11.612 --> 2:01:15.224
You're at the edge
of a toxic merry-go-round.

2:01:15.268 --> 2:01:18.096
The main activity should
be towards the central hub,

2:01:18.140 --> 2:01:19.272
which is directly above you.

2:01:41.032 --> 2:01:42.469
-

2:01:52.870 --> 2:01:54.524
Bond.

2:01:54.568 --> 2:01:56.178
Bond, there's something...

2:01:56.221 --> 2:01:58.006
There's something
big up ahead,

2:01:58.049 --> 2:01:59.355
I can't work out what it is.
It's...

2:02:00.965 --> 2:02:01.792
These walls
must be thick.

2:02:08.582 --> 2:02:09.409
Bond.

2:02:11.062 --> 2:02:12.977
Bond? 007, do you read me?

2:02:13.021 --> 2:02:15.371
We've lost them.

2:02:15.415 --> 2:02:17.199
They've entered
a blind spot, sir.

2:02:17.242 --> 2:02:18.983
I can't work out what it is
they've walked into.

2:02:19.027 --> 2:02:20.507
Well, just get them back.

2:02:53.670 --> 2:02:55.542
Well,
will you look at those doors.

2:02:56.586 --> 2:02:58.109
This was a missile silo.

2:02:58.153 --> 2:02:59.154
Right.

2:03:01.199 --> 2:03:02.375
Let's go.

2:03:09.947 --> 2:03:12.167
Everybody, over there!
In the corner! Now!

2:03:12.210 --> 2:03:14.865
-What? How?
- Move!

2:03:14.909 --> 2:03:16.432
Move! On the ground!

2:03:18.391 --> 2:03:20.131
Alarm.

2:03:20.175 --> 2:03:21.785
-

2:03:21.829 --> 2:03:22.873
Down, boy.

2:03:40.325 --> 2:03:42.719
What... What are you doing?

2:03:42.763 --> 2:03:46.157
You cannot explode
laboratory, please.

2:03:46.201 --> 2:03:48.203
-

2:03:50.292 --> 2:03:54.470
This is suicide mission.
Come on.

2:03:54.514 --> 2:03:56.603
You will never leave
this island alive.

2:04:03.218 --> 2:04:04.132
That was the farm.

2:04:05.742 --> 2:04:07.352
And this is the factory.

2:04:20.540 --> 2:04:22.150
They're mass-producing it.

2:04:22.193 --> 2:04:23.673
Nomi, come and look at this.

2:04:23.717 --> 2:04:26.154
Well, look,
you cannot stop it, mister.

2:04:26.197 --> 2:04:28.504
We have big plan, you know.

2:04:28.548 --> 2:04:30.071
-We have big numbers.
-What is it?

2:04:30.114 --> 2:04:31.551
It's a simulation.

2:04:31.594 --> 2:04:33.291
They're not
just attacking individuals.

2:04:33.335 --> 2:04:35.555
They're going to kill millions.

2:04:35.598 --> 2:04:37.992
It will not fit
in a suitcase this time, lady.

2:04:38.035 --> 2:04:39.994
He's really getting
on my nerves.

2:04:40.037 --> 2:04:40.864
Well, shut him up.

2:04:42.823 --> 2:04:45.347
Ow!

2:04:45.390 --> 2:04:46.914
My nose.

2:04:50.657 --> 2:04:53.747
We have
to destroy this whole facility.

2:04:53.790 --> 2:04:55.096
There is no need for violence.

2:04:55.139 --> 2:04:57.490
Mr. Safin,
they use explosives.

2:04:57.533 --> 2:04:59.492
Shut up.
- Mr. Bond,

2:05:01.145 --> 2:05:04.714
you have something of mine
and I have something of yours.

2:05:06.368 --> 2:05:09.153
Why don't you come up
and we can talk about it?

2:05:09.197 --> 2:05:10.067
Like adults.

2:05:12.983 --> 2:05:14.507
Safin, where is he?

2:05:20.251 --> 2:05:21.601
If I don't come back,

2:05:23.211 --> 2:05:24.342
blow it all to shit.

2:05:25.648 --> 2:05:26.780
We don't have enough
explosives for that.

2:05:26.823 --> 2:05:28.695
Yeah, but they don't know that.

2:05:31.785 --> 2:05:32.568
Huh.

2:05:43.274 --> 2:05:45.189
-

2:05:47.409 --> 2:05:49.585
He said you must drink.

2:05:49.629 --> 2:05:51.674
-For your health.
- Do you trust him?

2:05:51.718 --> 2:05:54.634
He made me kill
your last master.

2:05:54.677 --> 2:05:56.505
Why do you think
he let you join him?

2:05:56.549 --> 2:05:59.726
I think he wants you to drink.

2:06:02.642 --> 2:06:05.296
I want him to give me
my daughter back.

2:06:05.340 --> 2:06:08.386
He said if you behave,
you'll see her. Drink.

2:06:19.049 --> 2:06:20.398
Do you know
what this flower does?

2:06:26.404 --> 2:06:27.754
It makes you blind.

2:06:29.494 --> 2:06:31.322
Just a drop of this
in your eye,

2:06:31.366 --> 2:06:32.759
and you'll never see again.

2:06:35.413 --> 2:06:37.198
Losing one eye is a tragedy.

2:06:37.241 --> 2:06:38.808
Losing two...

2:06:38.852 --> 2:06:40.984
-No games.
-This is not a game.

2:07:20.110 --> 2:07:20.633
Welcome.

2:07:22.939 --> 2:07:23.679
On the floor.

2:07:32.993 --> 2:07:33.820
Your sidearm.

2:07:35.865 --> 2:07:36.649
Careful.

2:07:42.219 --> 2:07:44.657
-She is light as a feather.
- All right!

2:07:56.146 --> 2:07:56.843
Please, sit.

2:08:03.980 --> 2:08:05.765
It's going to be all right.

2:08:05.808 --> 2:08:07.592
Promise you,
it's going to be all right.

2:08:08.593 --> 2:08:10.857
James Bond.

2:08:10.900 --> 2:08:13.294
History of violence.

2:08:13.337 --> 2:08:14.861
License to kill.

2:08:15.992 --> 2:08:18.603
Vendetta with Ernst Blofeld.

2:08:18.647 --> 2:08:20.344
In love with Madeleine Swann.

2:08:22.782 --> 2:08:24.914
I could be speaking
to my own reflection.

2:08:24.958 --> 2:08:27.177
We've made
slightly different choices.

2:08:27.221 --> 2:08:30.877
No. We've just developed
different methods
for the same goal.

2:08:32.617 --> 2:08:35.533
Only your skills die
with your body.

2:08:35.577 --> 2:08:38.972
Mine will survive
long after I'm gone.

2:08:39.015 --> 2:08:41.975
And life is all about
leaving something behind.

2:08:44.542 --> 2:08:45.369
Isn't it?

2:08:47.067 --> 2:08:48.721
Doesn't have to be ugly.

2:08:50.287 --> 2:08:52.768
You leave my baby alone,
I leave yours.

2:08:52.812 --> 2:08:53.943
What do you think?

2:08:57.381 --> 2:08:59.209
I think you're right.

2:09:01.211 --> 2:09:02.430
Thank you.

2:09:02.473 --> 2:09:03.736
I think we are the same.

2:09:05.041 --> 2:09:06.739
We both know
what it feels like

2:09:06.782 --> 2:09:09.045
to have everything
taken from us

2:09:09.089 --> 2:09:12.048
before we're even
in the fight.

2:09:12.092 --> 2:09:16.749
It would have been nice
to have a chance,

2:09:16.792 --> 2:09:18.881
you know, don't you think?

2:09:18.925 --> 2:09:21.928
Just...
we all should get a chance.

2:09:21.971 --> 2:09:24.495
But this thing
that you're building,

2:09:24.539 --> 2:09:26.759
it puts everyone,

2:09:26.802 --> 2:09:29.457
the whole world
on a battlefield.

2:09:29.500 --> 2:09:31.328
Nobody gets a chance.

2:09:34.767 --> 2:09:38.118
The thing
that no one wants to admit

2:09:38.161 --> 2:09:42.165
is that most people want things
to happen to them.

2:09:42.209 --> 2:09:45.429
We tell each other lies
about the fight for free will

2:09:45.473 --> 2:09:47.040
and independence,

2:09:47.083 --> 2:09:50.652
but we don't really want that.

2:09:50.695 --> 2:09:52.001
We want to be told how to live,

2:09:53.960 --> 2:09:55.700
and then die
when we are not looking.

2:09:57.485 --> 2:10:00.053
People want oblivion,

2:10:01.706 --> 2:10:04.840
and a few of us are born
to build it for them.

2:10:07.060 --> 2:10:10.890
So, here I am,
their invisible god...

2:10:12.935 --> 2:10:16.852
sneaking under their skin.

2:10:16.896 --> 2:10:19.333
You know that history
isn't kind
to those who play God.

2:10:19.376 --> 2:10:20.290
And you don't?

2:10:22.466 --> 2:10:27.558
We both eradicate people
to make the world
a better place.

2:10:27.602 --> 2:10:32.476
I just want to be
a little... tidier.

2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:35.610
Without collateral.

2:10:35.653 --> 2:10:38.091
I want the world to evolve,

2:10:38.134 --> 2:10:39.875
yet you want it
to stay the same.

2:10:41.311 --> 2:10:42.095
Let's face it...

2:10:45.968 --> 2:10:49.537
-I've made you redundant.
- No.

2:10:49.580 --> 2:10:51.408
Not as long
as there are people
like you in the world.

2:10:53.584 --> 2:10:56.936
And with all due respect
to the enormity of your...

2:10:58.067 --> 2:10:59.242
tidy achievements,

2:11:00.940 --> 2:11:03.464
all you're really doing is
standing in a very long line

2:11:03.507 --> 2:11:05.727
of angry little men.

2:11:05.770 --> 2:11:09.513
I'm not angry,
just passionate.

2:11:11.385 --> 2:11:14.301
Disable your explosives,
get off my island,

2:11:14.344 --> 2:11:17.652
and you can take this precious
little angel with you.

2:11:19.567 --> 2:11:20.133
And Madeleine?

2:11:22.526 --> 2:11:24.920
-She stays.
-You know I can't do that.

2:11:26.139 --> 2:11:27.792
That is a shame.

2:11:29.533 --> 2:11:31.057
She really hoped you would.

2:11:32.188 --> 2:11:34.364
She knows
it's her only path to survive.

2:11:34.408 --> 2:11:37.411
No, you have her tell me that.

2:11:37.454 --> 2:11:41.154
What mother wouldn't sacrifice
herself for her own child?

2:11:43.983 --> 2:11:45.071
Is that what happened to yours?

2:11:51.468 --> 2:11:53.949
My mother lay at my feet
as I watched her die.

2:11:57.997 --> 2:11:59.128
Wait! Wait. Wait.

2:12:03.828 --> 2:12:04.960
I'll do whatever you want.

2:12:05.004 --> 2:12:06.005
Yes, you will.

2:12:09.573 --> 2:12:11.097
I... I apologize.

2:12:14.404 --> 2:12:15.753
I'm sorry.

2:12:16.711 --> 2:12:18.495
Simple choices, Mr. Bond.

2:12:20.280 --> 2:12:22.064
Like do you want to die
in front of your daughter?

2:12:24.545 --> 2:12:26.199
Or do you want your daughter
to die in front of you?

2:12:26.242 --> 2:12:28.027
No. No. No. No. No.

2:12:30.594 --> 2:12:31.944
I am sorry.

2:12:33.858 --> 2:12:35.121
I'm sorry.

2:12:37.123 --> 2:12:38.385
Look at your father, Mathilde.

2:12:42.476 --> 2:12:43.564
This is power.

2:12:43.607 --> 2:12:44.652
I'm sorry.

2:12:45.696 --> 2:12:48.221
I'm truly, truly sorry.

2:12:58.274 --> 2:12:59.188
James!

2:13:00.842 --> 2:13:02.539
-Where is she?
-

2:13:06.239 --> 2:13:07.501
The first shipment
is on the dock,

2:13:07.544 --> 2:13:09.155
-ready for pickup, Doctor.
- Very good.

2:13:28.261 --> 2:13:30.002
Hmm...

2:13:32.265 --> 2:13:34.180
If you don't want
my protection, then...

2:13:35.790 --> 2:13:37.009
off you go.

2:13:47.497 --> 2:13:50.022
Move.
Our first buyers are arriving.

2:14:03.557 --> 2:14:06.864
Sir, I've just detected
some suspicious activity.

2:14:06.908 --> 2:14:09.476
Several high-speed transports
are headed towards the island.

2:14:09.519 --> 2:14:10.825
Origin unknown.

2:14:10.868 --> 2:14:11.695
Still no sign of 007.

2:14:14.307 --> 2:14:17.353
Come on, Bond.
Where the hell are you?

2:14:17.397 --> 2:14:20.791
This is hopeless situation,
lady. Please.

2:14:23.316 --> 2:14:24.839
Bond.

2:14:24.882 --> 2:14:27.885
-Bond.

2:14:27.929 --> 2:14:30.279
The party is larger
than the reservation.

2:14:30.323 --> 2:14:33.369
Look, lady,
please, please just let me go.

2:14:33.413 --> 2:14:36.111
I... There was never
gonna be a way out.

2:14:37.591 --> 2:14:38.679
Stop this nonsense.

2:14:38.722 --> 2:14:40.811
You don't have a chance,
anyways.

2:14:42.639 --> 2:14:46.121
Hey. Hey, I have a good vial
for your people,

2:14:46.165 --> 2:14:47.992
good for West African diaspora.
It can be a good thing.

2:15:05.009 --> 2:15:07.708
You know,
I do not need laboratory

2:15:07.751 --> 2:15:10.145
to exterminate your entire race
from the face of the Earth.

2:15:12.365 --> 2:15:14.410
-Do you know what time it is?
-What?

2:15:14.454 --> 2:15:16.151
Time to die.

2:15:16.195 --> 2:15:18.545
No!

2:15:28.381 --> 2:15:29.773
Move! Move!

2:15:34.648 --> 2:15:36.084
They dropped down
to a lower level.

2:15:36.128 --> 2:15:37.781
There has to be
a stairwell down.

2:15:37.825 --> 2:15:38.521
Mama?

2:15:47.835 --> 2:15:49.315
Mathilde. Mathilde.

2:16:04.373 --> 2:16:05.592
We should go.

2:16:07.507 --> 2:16:09.161
It's Q. Do you read me?

2:16:10.814 --> 2:16:11.989
Come in, 007, it's Q.

2:16:17.517 --> 2:16:19.649
Traffic. We have traffic.

2:16:19.693 --> 2:16:22.304
-I think we just got buzzed.
-Those are two Russian MiGs.

2:16:22.348 --> 2:16:24.045
Traffic. TCAS,
you have control.

2:16:24.088 --> 2:16:25.612
I understand, and I'm doing
the best that I can.

2:16:25.655 --> 2:16:27.788
Just please wait.

2:16:27.831 --> 2:16:30.007
Sir, I've got the Navy,

2:16:30.051 --> 2:16:31.879
the Japanese, the Russians,
all breathing down my neck,

2:16:31.922 --> 2:16:34.142
demanding to know why
we've got a C-17

2:16:34.186 --> 2:16:35.317
circling a disputed island.

2:16:39.365 --> 2:16:40.409
Don't tell them
anything just yet.

2:16:43.369 --> 2:16:46.763
-

2:16:59.776 --> 2:17:02.301
Ah, just in time.
- Nomi, you know...

2:17:03.476 --> 2:17:06.000
Madeleine, Mathilde,
they're my, uh...

2:17:06.043 --> 2:17:07.262
-Hey.
-Hi.

2:17:07.306 --> 2:17:08.263
Family?

2:17:10.787 --> 2:17:12.659
Q. Q, are you there?

2:17:12.702 --> 2:17:14.182
Yes. Bond.

2:17:14.226 --> 2:17:17.533
Do we have
any Royal Naval vessels

2:17:17.577 --> 2:17:20.971
-in the immediate vicinity?
-Uh, yes. Why?

2:17:21.015 --> 2:17:22.843
We are gonna need
an immediate strike
on this location.

2:17:22.886 --> 2:17:24.932
This whole island,

2:17:24.975 --> 2:17:27.674
it's a manufacturing plant
for Heracles.

2:17:27.717 --> 2:17:29.719
We don't have clearance
for missile strikes, do we?

2:17:29.763 --> 2:17:31.678
Mm-mm.

2:17:31.721 --> 2:17:33.854
Bond, there's something
else you should know.

2:17:33.897 --> 2:17:37.118
Several unidentified ships
are headed your way.

2:17:37.161 --> 2:17:39.425
They're coming after Heracles.
How far out?

2:17:39.468 --> 2:17:40.513
Uh, 20 minutes.

2:17:42.079 --> 2:17:43.255
Q, patch me through.

2:17:44.778 --> 2:17:46.997
007.
-M.

2:17:47.041 --> 2:17:50.523
Our operation
is attracting a lot
of international attention.

2:17:50.566 --> 2:17:51.872
We're seeing what we can do.

2:17:51.915 --> 2:17:52.525
Come on.

2:17:54.266 --> 2:17:55.397
Let's go. Come on.

2:18:02.926 --> 2:18:05.755
It's going to get
very cold out there, so...

2:18:07.061 --> 2:18:08.758
I want you to have this.

2:18:11.065 --> 2:18:12.066
That'll keep you warm.

2:18:17.506 --> 2:18:19.943
I have to finish this. For us.

2:18:21.118 --> 2:18:22.337
I know.

2:18:32.565 --> 2:18:33.479
I'll just be a minute.

2:18:41.008 --> 2:18:41.704
I've got them.

2:18:43.532 --> 2:18:44.490
This might come in handy.

2:18:45.839 --> 2:18:47.493
Thank you.

2:19:10.037 --> 2:19:12.039
Q, talk to me.

2:19:12.082 --> 2:19:15.608
Um, our uninvited guests
are 15 minutes away.

2:19:15.651 --> 2:19:19.960
Bond, M here. The situation
is diplomatically complex.

2:19:20.003 --> 2:19:23.093
We don't have a choice.
Fire on my mark.

2:19:23.137 --> 2:19:25.574
If we launch,
the Russians, the Japanese

2:19:25.618 --> 2:19:27.533
and even the Americans
will want answers.

2:19:27.576 --> 2:19:28.621
Well, don't give them any.

2:19:31.928 --> 2:19:34.191
Rational minds, Bond.

2:19:34.235 --> 2:19:35.932
I'm trying to save this from
escalating to all-out war.

2:19:37.804 --> 2:19:40.633
Mallory, if we don't do this,

2:19:40.676 --> 2:19:41.808
there will be nothing
left to save.

2:19:43.853 --> 2:19:46.421
Fire on my mark.

2:19:46.465 --> 2:19:47.944
007,
there's another problem.

2:19:47.988 --> 2:19:49.903
-That room you were just in.
-Yes, I know, I know.

2:19:49.946 --> 2:19:51.600
I've got
to open the blast doors.

2:19:51.644 --> 2:19:53.167
Otherwise our missiles
will bounce off it

2:19:53.210 --> 2:19:55.169
like they've hit a trampoline.

2:19:55.212 --> 2:19:56.431
Yes, I know, I know.

2:19:58.302 --> 2:20:00.392
Find the control room.
It should be in a tower

2:20:00.435 --> 2:20:02.437
just above the blast doors.

2:20:02.481 --> 2:20:05.135
The missiles will take about
nine minutes from launch.

2:20:05.179 --> 2:20:06.789
Do you think you can do it
before the ships arrive?

2:20:06.833 --> 2:20:08.617
Plenty of time,
plenty of time.

2:23:17.240 --> 2:23:20.287
-

2:23:25.466 --> 2:23:27.773
Bond.
Bond, do you read me?

2:23:31.864 --> 2:23:33.082
Yeah, Q.

2:23:33.126 --> 2:23:34.301
I read you.

2:23:34.344 --> 2:23:36.085
Sounds like
you're in a rugby scrum.

2:23:36.129 --> 2:23:37.609
I just showed someone
your watch.

2:23:39.306 --> 2:23:40.786
Really blew their mind.

2:23:42.962 --> 2:23:45.878
Right, good.
Now, did you find
the control room?

2:23:48.271 --> 2:23:50.796
Well, my Russian
is a little rusty,
but I think so, yeah.

2:24:04.548 --> 2:24:06.333
Okay, Q.

2:24:06.376 --> 2:24:08.248
Uh,
I've done some research.

2:24:08.291 --> 2:24:10.685
Old schematics...
-Q, I am gonna need some...

2:24:10.729 --> 2:24:11.643
Yes?

2:24:12.992 --> 2:24:14.210
Bond?

2:24:17.387 --> 2:24:19.433
-Hello?
-Power.

2:24:19.476 --> 2:24:21.348
-Power?
-

2:24:21.391 --> 2:24:23.176
Right, the infrastructure
must go back to the 1950s,

2:24:23.219 --> 2:24:24.612
so it's going to be
an overly complicated

2:24:24.656 --> 2:24:26.658
and intricate
switching system.

2:24:26.701 --> 2:24:29.704
Now, the order
in which you engage it

2:24:29.748 --> 2:24:31.140
will need to be
extremely precise.

2:24:31.184 --> 2:24:34.187
You're looking
for a control panel.

2:24:34.230 --> 2:24:37.451
There should be
a counterweight clutch.

2:24:37.494 --> 2:24:39.148
So, listen very carefully, 007.

2:24:39.192 --> 2:24:40.410
The first thing
you need to do...

2:24:40.454 --> 2:24:41.847
Got it.

2:24:43.152 --> 2:24:43.805
I think.

2:24:58.472 --> 2:24:59.995
Yep, that's it.
Launch the missiles.

2:25:00.039 --> 2:25:01.736
Not until you're clear.

2:25:01.780 --> 2:25:03.346
Q, tell M
to launch the missiles now.

2:25:04.739 --> 2:25:08.177
Okay. Okay, okay.
Understood.

2:25:08.221 --> 2:25:09.918
M, Bond says fire.

2:25:11.746 --> 2:25:13.356
HMS Dragon here.

2:25:13.400 --> 2:25:14.880
-Admiral.
-Sir.

2:25:16.708 --> 2:25:19.711
-M here.
-What are my instructions?

2:25:19.754 --> 2:25:21.756
You have permission to launch.

2:25:21.800 --> 2:25:23.366
Roger. Launching the strike.

2:25:37.729 --> 2:25:40.296
Missiles airborne.
Nine minutes out.

2:26:09.021 --> 2:26:10.762
No.

2:26:12.372 --> 2:26:13.765
No. No, no!

2:26:46.710 --> 2:26:50.410
Quite a mess you've made.
Like an animal.

2:26:50.453 --> 2:26:52.412
-

2:26:55.894 --> 2:26:57.809
-

2:27:19.178 --> 2:27:24.661
Now we are both poisoned
with heartbreak.

2:27:27.186 --> 2:27:29.841
Two heroes in a tragedy
of our own making.

2:27:37.544 --> 2:27:41.026
Anyone we touch,
we are their curse.

2:27:42.157 --> 2:27:44.159
A stroke to their cheek,

2:27:44.203 --> 2:27:45.857
a kiss...

2:27:47.771 --> 2:27:49.948
would kill them instantly.

2:27:54.561 --> 2:27:55.649
Yes...

2:27:57.129 --> 2:27:57.999
Madeleine.

2:28:00.959 --> 2:28:04.658
Yes, Mathilde.

2:28:20.892 --> 2:28:23.459
You made me do this,
you see?

2:28:28.943 --> 2:28:30.684
This was your choice.

2:29:18.645 --> 2:29:20.690
Q. Q, are you there?

2:29:20.734 --> 2:29:21.735
Bond, there you are.

2:29:21.778 --> 2:29:22.997
Are they safe, Q?

2:29:23.041 --> 2:29:25.782
Yes, they're safe.

2:29:25.826 --> 2:29:28.263
Bond,
have you left the island?

2:29:28.307 --> 2:29:30.091
There's a slight problem
with the blast doors.

2:29:31.571 --> 2:29:32.398
Won't take a sec.

2:29:34.530 --> 2:29:37.751
No, no, no. Bond, the missiles
have already launched.

2:29:37.794 --> 2:29:39.231
Just get out of there.

2:29:50.285 --> 2:29:52.200
Q, how do I, uh...

2:29:53.071 --> 2:29:55.160
How do I destroy this?

2:29:56.291 --> 2:29:57.989
If the silo doors are open,

2:29:58.032 --> 2:29:59.381
the missiles
will deal with it.

2:29:59.425 --> 2:30:01.905
No. No, no, no.
If you get it on you,
how do...

2:30:03.255 --> 2:30:05.126
How do you get it off?

2:30:05.170 --> 2:30:06.519
You know as well as I do
that you can't.

2:30:06.562 --> 2:30:08.173
It's... It's permanent.

2:30:08.216 --> 2:30:11.437
It's eternal. Which is why
we have to destroy it.

2:30:11.480 --> 2:30:15.093
For Christ's sake, James,
just get off the island.

2:30:15.136 --> 2:30:17.008
It's harmless unless
you're near to the target.

2:30:19.140 --> 2:30:22.143
Yeah.
Well, that's not gonna work.

2:30:28.715 --> 2:30:30.021
Oh, God. Oh, God.

2:30:32.762 --> 2:30:33.285
It's for Madeleine.

2:30:37.680 --> 2:30:39.117
It's all right, Q.

2:30:40.596 --> 2:30:42.511
It's all all right.

2:30:44.078 --> 2:30:45.906
Would you put
Madeleine on, please?

2:30:45.949 --> 2:30:47.125
Yes, of course.
How stupid of me.

2:30:53.044 --> 2:30:54.958
Nomi, come in.
Can you put Madeleine on?

2:30:56.786 --> 2:30:57.744
Madeleine.

2:31:05.404 --> 2:31:07.449
-James.
-Madeleine.

2:31:07.493 --> 2:31:08.755
I'm here.

2:31:09.756 --> 2:31:10.626
Where are you?

2:31:12.498 --> 2:31:13.499
Is it done?

2:31:14.630 --> 2:31:15.762
-James?
-Yes.

2:31:15.805 --> 2:31:17.372
Yes, he's... He's dead.

2:31:17.416 --> 2:31:19.331
-Are you both there?
-Yes.

2:31:21.376 --> 2:31:23.857
Good. You're safe.
That's good.

2:31:24.858 --> 2:31:26.381
Have you left?

2:31:29.776 --> 2:31:31.169
No. Um...

2:31:32.779 --> 2:31:33.519
I'm not gonna make it.

2:31:36.391 --> 2:31:37.218
What?

2:31:40.439 --> 2:31:42.658
-Madeleine. Madeleine.
-You promised.

2:31:44.095 --> 2:31:45.270
Just get off that island.

2:31:47.968 --> 2:31:49.012
I know you can do this.

2:31:52.146 --> 2:31:53.756
Everything's good now.

2:31:57.020 --> 2:31:58.892
There's no one left
to hurt us.

2:31:58.935 --> 2:32:00.023
Madeleine...

2:32:03.592 --> 2:32:05.333
you have made...

2:32:06.813 --> 2:32:10.947
the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

2:32:13.167 --> 2:32:14.516
She's perfect.

2:32:18.868 --> 2:32:20.131
Because she came from you.

2:32:32.230 --> 2:32:34.145
Oh, God. The vial.

2:32:39.150 --> 2:32:40.151
You've been poisoned.

2:32:42.196 --> 2:32:43.154
Yes.

2:32:44.416 --> 2:32:45.330
There must be a way.

2:32:50.378 --> 2:32:51.162
There must be a way.

2:33:03.870 --> 2:33:05.219
We just need more time.

2:33:06.438 --> 2:33:07.874
If we only had more time.

2:33:14.185 --> 2:33:15.969
You have all the time
in the world.

2:33:19.886 --> 2:33:21.192
I love you.

2:33:24.934 --> 2:33:25.674
I love you too.

2:33:46.869 --> 2:33:48.436
She does have your eyes.

2:33:52.571 --> 2:33:54.225
I know.

2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:09.240
I know.

2:35:13.826 --> 2:35:16.568
Very hard to know
what to say,

2:35:16.611 --> 2:35:19.875
but I thought we should gather
and remember.

2:35:21.224 --> 2:35:23.052
And I...

2:35:23.096 --> 2:35:27.361
I thought
this was appropriate.

2:35:31.887 --> 2:35:36.022
"The function of man
is to live, not to exist.

2:35:39.460 --> 2:35:41.984
I shall not waste my days
trying to prolong them.

2:35:43.638 --> 2:35:45.510
I shall use my time."

2:35:58.436 --> 2:35:59.567
To James.

2:36:00.873 --> 2:36:02.091
-James.
-James.

2:36:02.135 --> 2:36:03.571
James.

2:36:05.399 --> 2:36:07.009
James.

2:36:15.278 --> 2:36:17.585
Right, back to work.

2:36:34.776 --> 2:36:36.865
Mathilde.

2:36:38.127 --> 2:36:39.564
I'm going to tell you
a story...

2:36:41.870 --> 2:36:44.046
about a man.

2:36:44.090 --> 2:36:45.613
His name was Bond.

2:36:47.485 --> 2:36:48.486
