why Angie's surgery is so last-minute?

'Cause it's all done on a volunteer basis.
The surgeons donate their services,

I mean, what if she's not going to?
You can't wait around forever.

29:30.335 --> 29:31.802
Maybe it's...

29:32.537 --> 29:34.732
Maybe it's time to move on.

29:48.753 --> 29:50.880
She's supposed to come back.

30:12.177 --> 30:16.375

- I don't know.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.710
- What?
- How's Angie?

30:19.384 --> 30:23.286
She's stronger than I am.
She's breathing on her own.

30:23.354 --> 30:25.345
They said she's doing great.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.920
- That's good. That's really good, Brooke.
- Yeah.

30:31.362 --> 30:34.490
Listen, I appreciate that you came by,

30:34.566 --> 30:37.592
but they said I'm the only one
who's allowed to be in here after hours.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.398
That's okay. I...

30:40.872 --> 30:43.739
- Lindsey called.
- See? That's great, Luke.

30:43.808 --> 30:46.038

30:46.110 --> 30:47.338

I meant, I don't know if the team won.

31:02.727 --> 31:06.128
But I lost. I know that for sure.

31:15.940 --> 31:19.239
So. Am I allowed to ask
what's going on with you and Lucas,

31:19.310 --> 31:21.278
or is that kind of like saying "Voldemort"?

31:21.346 --> 31:23.644
There's really not much to say, you know?

Get him drunk.

- Is this the 18-year-old?
- I'm just saying.

tell the truth when they're wasted.
