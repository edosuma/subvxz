WEBVTT

00:08.134 --> 00:09.802
The first Showcase Showdown.

00:09.885 --> 00:11.846
On its way, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:11.929 --> 00:16.809
It is round and around
and around that it goes.

00:20.563 --> 00:21.731
Where Denise at?

00:21.814 --> 00:23.733
She upstairs with her
little boyfriend.

00:23.816 --> 00:26.110
Oh, wait. Denise
got a little boyfriend?

00:26.193 --> 00:28.279
Mm-hmm.

00:31.282 --> 00:33.075
Y'all better stop running
through this house.

00:33.159 --> 00:33.993
Yes, Grandma.

00:34.076 --> 00:35.995
Denise, what were
y'all doing up there?

00:36.078 --> 00:37.788
Watching Fresh Prince.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.248
You weren't eating
candy, were you?

00:39.331 --> 00:40.499
No.

00:40.583 --> 00:44.503
Dev, do y'all even celebrate
Thanksgiving in your house?

00:44.587 --> 00:47.256
Is that a thing y'all do
in the Indian community?

00:47.339 --> 00:48.591
We have lunch together.

00:48.674 --> 00:51.469
Then my dad watches The
Godfather and falls asleep.

00:53.137 --> 00:57.683
Well, you are welcome to come have
Thanksgiving with us anytime you want.

00:57.767 --> 01:00.186
What's the Indian community?

01:01.270 --> 01:03.481
Dev is Indian.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.232
Wait. I thought Dev was black.

01:05.316 --> 01:07.568
- I'm brown.
- Black people are brown, too.

01:07.651 --> 01:08.486
Oh, Lord.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.570
Okay.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.364
Look, both of you
are minorities.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.116
What's a minority?

01:14.200 --> 01:18.287
It's a group of people who have to work
twice as hard in life to get half as far,

01:18.370 --> 01:20.706
and, Denise, you a black woman,

01:20.790 --> 01:23.209
so you gonna have to work
three times as hard.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.543
- I know that's right.
- Mm-hmm.

01:24.627 --> 01:27.046
You're both gonna
be disenfranchised.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.089
- Ma.
- I'm coming.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.924
Like a McDonald's?

01:30.007 --> 01:31.008
What?

01:31.092 --> 01:32.676
McDonald's is a franchise.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.804
When people open up
their own McDonald's,

01:34.887 --> 01:38.724
they just pay the big McDonald's man
a license fee so they can run it.

01:38.808 --> 01:40.768
That's what a franchise is.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.729
Denise, how the hell you
know what a franchise is

01:43.854 --> 01:45.689
but you don't know
Dev ain't black?

01:45.773 --> 01:47.066
I'm confused.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.818
I'm a McDonald's?

01:48.901 --> 01:51.237
You a McDonald's, and
Denise is a Burger King.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.365
Now, both y'all sit on down
so we can get ready to eat.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.450
And I'm a big old
White Castle, so...

01:58.536 --> 01:59.537
Ooh, this looks good.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.830
We gonna say grace first.

02:00.913 --> 02:01.914
Oh.

02:50.379 --> 02:53.924
Ooh, tell your mama to stop
smoking in the kitchen.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.468
Child, I'm old. I can
smoke wherever I want.

02:56.552 --> 02:59.346
Dropping ashes
all in the potatoes.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.015
It adds flavor.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.475
I don't want no
Newport potatoes.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.561
I was trying to help.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.194
♪ Skin is caramel
With the cocoa eyes ♪

03:13.277 --> 03:16.864
♪ Even got a big sister By

03:16.947 --> 03:18.699

03:20.451 --> 03:21.577

03:21.702 --> 03:23.662
What y'all doing in here?

03:23.746 --> 03:26.749
Dev, now, what you know
about brown sugar?

03:26.832 --> 03:30.169
You're 12 years old. You still
got some of your baby teeth.

03:30.252 --> 03:33.422
Now, y'all ain't got no business
listening to these songs.

03:33.505 --> 03:37.051
Look at Denise over there,
staring at D'Angelo.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.853
Denise, put on your dress

03:47.937 --> 03:50.064
so you can look nice for dinner.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.491
Man, this is some bullshit.

04:16.882 --> 04:20.469
Denise, that does not look like
the clothes I picked out for you.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.221
What happened to
that nice dress?

04:22.304 --> 04:24.014
It didn't fit right.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.849
You better make it fit.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.018
Why can't I just wear this?

04:28.102 --> 04:30.688
It's just us. Arsenio
ain't coming.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.315
- Arsenio's coming?
- No.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.567
Catherine, let that child
wear what she want to wear.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.027
And you watch your tone.

04:37.111 --> 04:38.612
Thanks, Aunt Joyce.

04:38.696 --> 04:40.781
All right, Ernestine, hurry
up and say this prayer.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.536
Thank you, Jesus, for bringing
all our family together

04:45.619 --> 04:49.415
in one room for another
Watkins family Thanksgiving.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.875
I want to bless the hands
that made the food.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.753
I want to bless the
family that's here today.

04:54.837 --> 04:59.300
I also want to bless the extended
family that is here, little Dev.

04:59.383 --> 05:00.843
- I also want to--
- Okay, we got it.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.469
God is able. Jesus wept.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.555
Can we please talk about O.J.?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.473
I don't know what we
gonna talk about.

05:06.557 --> 05:07.850
He didn't do it.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.601
What about all that blood?

05:09.685 --> 05:10.894
How you know, Grandma?

05:10.978 --> 05:11.979
'Cause I just know.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.399
Ooh, if Nicole was black, we
wouldn't even be talking about this.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.567
I know that's right.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.528
Honey, they are always trying
to take down our black icons.

05:19.611 --> 05:20.446
Mm-hmm.

05:20.529 --> 05:21.697
- Look at Michael.
- Oh!

05:21.780 --> 05:23.741
I still don't believe
he touched them kids.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.493
Child, anytime these folks see a
black man coming up in the world,

05:26.577 --> 05:29.872
making himself enough money to be
able to get himself a white woman,

05:29.955 --> 05:31.623
they try to frame him.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.792
What about Clarence Thomas?

05:33.876 --> 05:35.252
Fuck his ass.

05:38.464 --> 05:41.216
A five-year-old boy was found
alive, clinging to an inner tube

05:41.300 --> 05:44.011
approximately three miles off the
coast of Florida this morning

05:44.094 --> 05:44.928
and was rescued by the...

05:45.012 --> 05:47.056
You didn't put no parsnips
in that dressing, did you?

05:47.139 --> 05:48.640
No, Mama. No parsnips.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.642
That's my least
favorite vegetable.

05:50.726 --> 05:51.769
I hate them suckers.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.104
...seventeen-foot aluminum
boat that broke apart...

05:56.857 --> 05:59.651
Man, I told you this is stupid. You
can't play spades with two people.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.987
I'm trying to make it work.
You wanted to play spades.

06:02.071 --> 06:03.614
Let's see if Aunt
Joyce wants to play.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.658
She got a gambling problem. She can't
be around playing cards no more.

06:09.495 --> 06:11.538
Hey, can I talk to
you about something?

06:11.622 --> 06:12.998
Yeah, sure. What's up?

06:13.082 --> 06:14.541
All right, you know Erica?

06:14.625 --> 06:17.503
- White Erica or black Erica?
- Nah, mixed Erica.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.755
Oh, yeah, I know mixed Erica.
She's cute.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.716
Nah, mixed Erica's fine as hell.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.593
Okay.

06:24.676 --> 06:25.969
That's what I'm trying to say.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.889
Like... I like her.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.392
I have a crush on her.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.727
Wait, are you trying to
tell me that you're...

06:33.811 --> 06:35.687
you know?

06:35.771 --> 06:37.106
Lebanese.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.066
- Wait. You're from Lebanon?
- No.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.901
I just--I don't know how to--

06:40.984 --> 06:44.863
I'm not comfortable with
the word, uh, "lesbian."

06:49.618 --> 06:51.995
All right. So we'll
say you're Lebanese.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.541
I mean, I always thought
there was a good chance.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.752
You're the only girl who wore
Jordans to the Spring Fling,

06:58.836 --> 07:00.796
and you got those Jasmine
Guy posters up for years.

07:00.879 --> 07:02.881
I always felt like it
wasn't about her acting.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.967
And I have been dressing like
the Da Brat since preschool.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.762
You gonna tell your mom?

07:08.846 --> 07:11.932
Being gay isn't something black
people love to talk about.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.434
Why?

07:13.517 --> 07:16.562
Some black people think
being gay's a choice.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.939
And when they find out
that their kid is gay,

07:19.022 --> 07:21.191
they try to figure out
what they did wrong.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.444
Gay Martin's white. His
parents did the same thing.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.654
Yeah, but it's more
intense for black folks.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.906
All right, so everything's
a contest for us,

07:27.990 --> 07:29.700
and your kids are like trophies.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.369
Me being gay is like
tarnishing her trophy.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.456
I don't think being Lebanese
tarnishes the trophy.

07:35.539 --> 07:38.333
There's plenty of
straight trophies.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.919
I think it's cool you're
a Lebanese trophy.

07:41.003 --> 07:43.088
Thanks, dude.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.923
Damn, this has been
an intense talk.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.383
You want to smoke some weed?

07:46.467 --> 07:48.969
I got some shit that's dank.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.389
Are you sure I'm supposed
to see a dolphin?

08:34.473 --> 08:36.183
I don't see a dolphin.

08:37.017 --> 08:37.851
I don't know, man.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.603
I'm in another world right now.

08:41.063 --> 08:42.105
Denise?

08:43.607 --> 08:44.775
- Dev?
- Oh, shit.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.319
- I thought she was going to the store.
- Me too. Be cool.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.487
I'm cool. You be cool.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.656
Shut up.

08:51.823 --> 08:52.741
What y'all up to?

08:52.824 --> 08:54.785
Hey, Miss Wa--

08:54.868 --> 08:56.328
What the hell, Ma?

08:56.411 --> 08:58.997
It's just a hydrating mask.
You know I got a dry T-zone.

08:59.081 --> 09:00.707
What you freaking out for?

09:00.791 --> 09:02.751
We freaking out 'cause you're coming
in here looking like Dead Presidents.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.920
You're supposed to be at the store.
Why are you here?

09:05.003 --> 09:08.423
Yeah, I was going. Shoot,
Joyce say she can handle it.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.050
Dev,

09:10.133 --> 09:11.468
how your parents?

09:11.552 --> 09:12.928
They good?

09:14.221 --> 09:15.889
Yeah.

09:17.099 --> 09:19.726
I heard y'all were going
to Hawaii for Christmas.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.645
You excited?

09:21.728 --> 09:23.772
Yeah.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.860
Well, this has been a
stimulating conversation.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.364
- Yeah.
- Okay, bye, Mom.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.740
- Uh-uh.
- Bye, okay?

09:33.824 --> 09:37.077
Girl, don't be telling me where
I can go in my own house.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.370
Are you all right?

09:38.453 --> 09:40.706
'Cause I swear, y'all
look a little spaced out.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.082
We're just tired.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.126
Uh-huh.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.128
All right, I'm leaving.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.047
I'll see y'all later for dinner.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.799
You really need to
clean all this up.

09:50.882 --> 09:54.386
I'ma give this to the Goodwill,
somebody who appreciate it.

09:56.930 --> 09:57.848
D-did I seem too high?

09:57.931 --> 09:58.932
Was that-- was I cool?

09:59.016 --> 10:01.852
We cool. I'ma just kick
it with Jen real quick.

10:13.155 --> 10:16.199
How are you this tall
and you don't play basketball?

10:16.283 --> 10:17.868
I know. It sucks.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.871
Basketball scholarship would've
come in real handy right now.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.959
But I'm just glad you in college and
you ain't pregnant and on drugs.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.753
You don't got to worry
about me getting pregnant.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.129
Why? You got that UID thing?

10:29.212 --> 10:31.006
Okay, first of all,
it's not a UID.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.090
Okay? It's not a thing.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.635
- It's the IUD.
- Mm.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.720
But you ain't got to worry
about me and pregnancy.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.724
You got saved.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.018
- You done come to the Lord.
- No.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.103
I don't know why you
keep asking me that.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.484
I'm not...

10:50.567 --> 10:53.362
gonna get pregnant because...

10:53.445 --> 10:55.697
I don't like having
sex with men.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.662
Have you tried it?

11:01.745 --> 11:03.538
No.

11:03.622 --> 11:05.165
Then how you know
you don't like it?

11:05.248 --> 11:06.958
It's just something I know.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.047
Well, what you trying to say?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.968
What is the problem?

11:17.719 --> 11:20.472
I'm just annoyed that I even have
to have this conversation with you.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.099
What conversation?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.558
I'm sitting here being normal.

11:23.642 --> 11:26.019
You acting like a crazy person.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.277
Ma?

11:34.361 --> 11:35.362
Hmm?

11:37.906 --> 11:39.449
I'm gay.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.748
You what?

11:46.832 --> 11:47.874
I'm gay.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.464
I've always been gay.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.429
But I'm still the same person.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.932
I'm still your daughter.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.060
Nothing's changed.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.109
What's wrong?

12:16.737 --> 12:19.156
- Ma, why are you crying?
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.663
I just-- I don't want
life to be hard for you.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.419
It is hard enough being a
black woman in this world.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.755
Now you want to add
something else to that?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.925
It's not like this
was my choice.

12:41.887 --> 12:44.055
It's just who I am.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.684
Well, who else you done told?

12:47.768 --> 12:50.187
- Just Dev.
- Yeah, of course.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.816
You know you can't
tell your grandmother.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.359
Why?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.403
'Cause she won't be
able to handle this.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.367
And you know how
forgetful she is.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.453
You're gonna have to come out
to her every other week.

13:08.330 --> 13:09.331
True.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.668
She do be forgetting stuff.

13:19.341 --> 13:21.051
So how'd it go?

13:21.134 --> 13:24.971
Well, it wasn't my all-time
favorite conversation with my mom,

13:25.055 --> 13:27.974
but it was all right.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.518
She cried, though.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.603
Oh, man.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.438
I figured she would.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.398
She's a crier.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.609
She tell you she loves you

13:37.692 --> 13:41.071
and supports you no matter
what and all that stuff?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.405
No, man.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.449
This ain't an episode
of Growing Pains.

13:44.533 --> 13:45.992
She ain't say none of that.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.871
But at least she
didn't disown me,

13:49.955 --> 13:51.998
'cause that be happening.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.125
So...

13:54.209 --> 13:56.837
I guess it was a success.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.296
So she's a butch queen?

13:58.380 --> 13:59.923
No.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.092
I think that's something
else in the gay world.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.387
That's a world I don't
know nothing about, child.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.932
I just wish I knew
where I went wrong.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.684
What do you mean,
where you went wrong?

14:10.767 --> 14:12.477
Denise ain't never been
arrested, she in college,

14:12.561 --> 14:14.771
she keep a job, and she
respects her elders.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.356
Honey, she want to lay
around with some women,

14:16.439 --> 14:17.566
baby, that is her business.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.486
Maybe I just should've
spent more time with her.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.738
You spent plenty of
time with that girl.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.824
Is this 'cause I
couldn't keep a man?

14:27.909 --> 14:30.787
You not being able to keep a man
a whole 'nother conversation.

14:30.871 --> 14:31.955
- Please.
- But being gay

14:32.038 --> 14:34.666
- ain't got nothing to do with that.
- Oh, I know.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.878
I just never thought I
would have a gay daughter.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.838
Well, get used to it,
'cause one of these days,

14:39.921 --> 14:42.382
she gonna bring home one
of her little girlfriends.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.551
Oh, Lord.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.386
Oh, Lord!

14:46.469 --> 14:48.930
Well, I just hope she don't
bring home no white girl,

14:49.014 --> 14:51.683
'cause I don't want to see no
Jennifer Anistons up in here.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.685
Oh, honey, Becky is coming.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.396
And Megan.

14:56.479 --> 14:59.190
And Katie.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.693
All right, let's-- I'm
gonna finish the peas.

15:04.696 --> 15:07.449
Girl, it was about to get
serious, but I can't date nobody

15:07.532 --> 15:09.284
with a collection
of pinkie rings.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.328
Why not? Ain't nothing wrong
with a little jewelry.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.413
You wear toe rings.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.291
I dated a pimp once.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.003
Dev, Dev, get them steps.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.088
Dev, Dev, get them steps.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.174
I can't believe your mom
turned your room into a gym.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.342
Pretty harsh.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.135
You know my mom
likes to stay fit.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.804
What time's Michelle
getting here?

15:29.888 --> 15:31.848
She should be here soon.

15:31.932 --> 15:34.017
- You nervous?
- Hell, yeah.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.311
It's the first time my family's
gonna see me with a woman.

15:36.394 --> 15:40.023
My grandma don't really know I'm gay yet,
so she still thinks she's my "friend."

15:40.106 --> 15:42.734
All right. Don't stress. I'm here.
It's gonna be fine.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.320
Have you talked to your
parents about Rachel yet?

15:45.403 --> 15:46.404
No.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.239
- They don't know y'all live together?
- No.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.283
I feel like all three of them are
gonna be mad at you about that.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.785
Why would they be mad?

15:52.786 --> 15:54.162
Stupid.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.747
Shit, here she is. Come on.

15:55.830 --> 15:56.998
Michelle in the cut.

15:57.082 --> 15:58.583
Ooh, my legs are sore.

15:58.667 --> 15:59.709
Jesus.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.046
I got it. I got it.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.339
Hey, yo, give me a second?

16:04.422 --> 16:05.423
Sure, sure.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.010
- Hey, boo.
- Hey.

16:09.094 --> 16:11.221
- You're looking cute.
- Mm. Thank you.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.347
Thanks for the wine.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.807
You know I have class.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.767
Uh-huh. Aunt
Joyce gonna love you.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.478
- Ma, this is Michelle.
- Hi.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.646
Michelle, this is
my mom, Catherine.

16:19.729 --> 16:20.730
- It's so great to--
- Nice to meet you.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.232
- Yes.
- Okay.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.650
- Welcome...
- Okay.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.151
...to our home.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.444
That was awkward.

16:26.528 --> 16:27.737
Uh, this is my Aunt Joyce.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.781
- Oh, it's so great to finally...
- What's happening?

16:29.864 --> 16:31.074
- ...meet--
- How you doing?

16:31.157 --> 16:33.785
What the hell?
Really, Joyce?

16:33.868 --> 16:36.121
Okay, anyway, this is
my grandma Ernestine.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.289
Hello, there.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.417
- Ooh.
- This is my friend Michelle.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.002
Welcome, darling.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.004
- Thank you.
- Okay, Grandma.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.171
That's Dev.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.382
Hey. Friend of Denise's.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.758
No relation to the Watkins.

16:48.842 --> 16:49.926
Yeah, I figured.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.595
Yeah, the whole me-being-Indian
thing probably tipped you off.

16:52.679 --> 16:56.141
Fun Denise fact: when we were
kids, Denise thought I was black.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.308
Okay.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.102
Don't make me break out the
Halloween pictures, all right?

16:59.185 --> 17:00.770
Remember when you went
as Indian Peter Pan?

17:00.854 --> 17:03.314
Damn, why you got
to hate on the Pan?

17:03.398 --> 17:05.150
Remember when we were black
and Indian Mario and Luigi?

17:05.233 --> 17:07.736
- That was cute.
- Shut up.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.446
Oh, that look like
the expensive shit.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.322
- All right, come on.
- All right, Michelle.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.491
I see what you're doing.
Hey, yeah!

17:13.575 --> 17:14.617
Good to meet you, Michelle.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.203
Okay.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.121
Thanks, Ma.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.832
- Oh.
- Get out of here.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.418
- They're nice.
- Mm-hmm.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.295
They-- they are. They're great.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.642
Um, Denise,

17:39.726 --> 17:42.103
maybe we can take Michelle
to that Chinese restaurant

17:42.187 --> 17:43.730
in Flushing I was
telling you about.

17:43.813 --> 17:45.231
Yeah, that sounds cool.

17:45.315 --> 17:48.109
Dev, why you plotting
your next meal

17:48.193 --> 17:49.819
and you ain't finished
the one in front of you?

17:50.904 --> 17:52.405
Never too early to plan ahead,

17:52.489 --> 17:53.740
especially when it comes
to matters of the tum.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.577
Well, speaking of Chinese food,

17:57.660 --> 18:00.288
Michelle was living in
China earlier this year.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.792
Want to tell them
about that, babe?

18:03.875 --> 18:05.293
Yeah, um...

18:05.376 --> 18:08.004
I was living in Shanghai for
about two months for work.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.714
Mostly I just took
pictures with people

18:09.798 --> 18:11.925
who thought I was Beyonce'.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.760
This one restaurant even put
my photo up on the wall.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.303
I just didn't have the heart
to tell them the truth.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.431
I've always wanted to go to China.
Looks cool.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.016
Yeah, it is.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.395
Ma?

18:24.479 --> 18:26.689
Aunt Joyce?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.441
Grandma?

18:28.525 --> 18:31.277
Y'all have any thoughts on that?

18:32.821 --> 18:34.531
Well, you know my
hearing is bad.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.199
Where did she go?

18:36.282 --> 18:38.034
- China.
- Hmm?

18:38.118 --> 18:40.954
China! She went to
China, Grandma!

18:41.037 --> 18:42.497
Mm.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.750
She lived in Shanghai for
two months for work!

18:45.834 --> 18:48.086
And a lot of people
thought she was Beyonce'!

18:48.169 --> 18:50.588
And this one restaurant even
put her photo on the wall,

18:50.672 --> 18:53.049
but she didn't have the
heart to tell them!

18:53.133 --> 18:54.551
Oh.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.511
I always liked China.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.679
Mm.

18:57.762 --> 18:59.305
You must be really smart.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.223
Oh.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.851
You're smart,
and you're cute.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.478
You don't usually get both of
those in the same package.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.689
Usually you only get
one or the other.

19:07.772 --> 19:09.816
Oh, thank you very much.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.943
I could say the same
thing about Denise.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.864
- Thanks.
- Mm.

19:25.039 --> 19:28.168
Grandma Ernestine, your yams
turned out really nice this year!

19:28.251 --> 19:29.460
You add a little nutmeg?

19:29.544 --> 19:30.712
Hmm?

19:30.795 --> 19:33.548
I said your yams turned out
really nice this year!

19:33.631 --> 19:34.799
Did you add a little nutmeg?

19:34.883 --> 19:37.260
She added nutmeg! Don't you
ask another fucking question!

19:38.845 --> 19:40.513
Nutmeg, cinnamon,
whatever the hell!

19:40.597 --> 19:42.599
You know what go
in the damn yams!

19:45.226 --> 19:48.479
I don't have any appreciation for
what was going on at my table.

19:49.647 --> 19:50.732
What are you talking about?

19:50.815 --> 19:53.067
If you want to bring your
friend over here, that's fine,

19:53.151 --> 19:56.738
but don't be making eyes and rubbing
backs and getting all fresh.

19:56.821 --> 19:59.407
- I wasn't doing that.
- Oh, yes, you were.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.367
I saw you. I know that look.

20:01.451 --> 20:04.120
Oh, you used to make that
look for Rachel from Friends.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.955
I always thought you
were looking at Joey.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.415
Joey?

20:07.498 --> 20:09.209
Ma, are you serious? That
character was an idiot.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.878
Look, you can be lesbian
if you want to,

20:11.961 --> 20:15.131
but when you come up in here,
you gonna respect my house.

20:31.189 --> 20:34.067
Problem Child 2. Oh, shit.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.068
What else we got?

20:36.027 --> 20:38.863
Denise and Dev's Tap
Dance Recital 1991?

20:38.947 --> 20:40.323
Should we fire this up?

20:41.157 --> 20:42.408
You remember the routine?

20:43.785 --> 20:45.870
- 'Cause I don't.
- Man, sit your ass down.

20:47.205 --> 20:48.331
When's your boo arriving here?

20:48.414 --> 20:50.250
She should be here
in a few minutes.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.126
Wow. Thanksgiving invite.

20:52.210 --> 20:53.253
Must be serious.

20:53.336 --> 20:55.255
Yeah, man. I really like her.

20:55.338 --> 20:58.216
Nice. What's her Instagram name?
I want to look her up.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.926
Dude, you're literally gonna
meet her in a few minutes.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.303
I know, but I want to look it
up beforehand, get a vibe.

21:02.387 --> 21:05.139
I forgot.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.599
You forgot?

21:06.683 --> 21:07.684
Look it up.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.730
W-what's that?

21:12.814 --> 21:15.692
- NipplesAndToes23.
- Denise!

21:15.775 --> 21:18.861
You can't be dating some girl with
the Instagram name NipplesAndToes23.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.905
I know, man. I'm trying
to get her to change it.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.199
I'm surprised there
was 22 other NipplesAndToes.

21:24.367 --> 21:25.702
Let's see what we got here.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.661
Oh, wow.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.663
These are some
provocative photos.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.581
Okay, don't be looking
at my girl, man.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.709
Ooh. Really into fitness.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.379
She is kind of naked there.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.715
Well, maybe I shouldn't just
paint her with one brush.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.675
She's clearly very political.

21:40.758 --> 21:41.884
"I just voted."

21:41.968 --> 21:44.345
Man, that wasn't for
no damn election.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.888
That was for So You
Think You Can Dance.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.808
Does she have some sort of
intense fabric allergy?

21:48.891 --> 21:52.061
'Cause she is scantily clad in
a lot of these photos, Denise.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.063
Oh, shit!

21:54.147 --> 21:56.649
NipplesAndToes in the building!
Let's go!

21:56.733 --> 21:58.318
- I'll be there in a second.
- Okay.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.613
See, that's the thing about
Sandra Bland, you know?

22:02.697 --> 22:04.532
It's like, she reminded
me so much of myself.

22:04.615 --> 22:06.159
Like, she was woke.
She was confident.

22:06.242 --> 22:07.869
She didn't take no shit.

22:08.786 --> 22:11.622
The scary thing is, that's
what got her killed.

22:11.706 --> 22:15.084
If Sandra was white, we wouldn't
even be having this conversation.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.837
- Yeah, you got that right.
- Yep.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.797
That's why
I keep telling y'all,

22:19.881 --> 22:23.634
if the police pull you
over, just nod your head

22:23.718 --> 22:25.219
and shut the fuck up.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.180
Yo, Dev, what about
the Indian grandpa?

22:27.263 --> 22:30.933
Oh, yeah, it's big on the Indian
people email chains I'm on.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.103
So apparently there was this
Indian grandpa in Alabama,

22:34.187 --> 22:35.897
and he was walking
around his neighborhood,

22:35.980 --> 22:37.440
and some lady called
the cops and said,

22:37.523 --> 22:39.359
"Oh, there's a black
guy walking around."

22:39.442 --> 22:41.402
And so the cops are like,
"We'll look into it."

22:41.486 --> 22:43.571
And they go over there, and
they try to talk to him,

22:43.654 --> 22:45.073
and he doesn't speak English.

22:45.156 --> 22:46.449
So he's confused. He hasn't
done anything wrong.

22:46.532 --> 22:47.492
He tries to walk away.

22:48.076 --> 22:51.329
Cop just grabs him, slams him
on the ground face-first,

22:51.412 --> 22:52.413
and he's paralyzed now.

22:52.497 --> 22:55.083
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

22:55.166 --> 22:57.710
I think I know the
answer to this question,

22:57.794 --> 22:59.962
but did anything
happen to the cops?

23:00.046 --> 23:01.089
Nope.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.341
They said it was a
justified use of force.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.385
Oh. That's horrible.

23:05.468 --> 23:06.719
Horrible.

23:08.304 --> 23:11.474
So I was watching the news the
other day, and apparently,

23:11.557 --> 23:13.518
there's this bulldog
that set a world record

23:13.601 --> 23:16.229
for skateboarding through
30 people's legs.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.855
DD, you seen that clip.

23:17.939 --> 23:19.482
He was going through
the legs like...

23:25.405 --> 23:27.156
Yeah, that wasn't the
news that was on.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.825
That was WorldstarHipHop.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.118
That's the news.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.413
DD, let's take a selfie.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.039
All right. Let's do
it quick, though.

23:35.873 --> 23:36.707
Ready?

23:39.127 --> 23:41.295
Oh, this has to go on the 'Gram.

23:41.963 --> 23:44.632
Hey, Nikki, what is
your username on there?

23:44.715 --> 23:46.008
NipplesAndToes23.

23:47.552 --> 23:48.886
Oh. What was it again?

23:48.970 --> 23:51.222
NipplesAndToes23.

23:51.305 --> 23:52.932
I'm gonna add
you real quick.

23:53.015 --> 23:55.476
What-- so NipplesAndToes43.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.312
No, NipplesAndToes23.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.481
NipplesAndToes23.

24:01.065 --> 24:02.191
Yeah.

24:03.818 --> 24:08.531
Wait, is it "NipplesNToes,"
or is it "Nipples&Toes"?

24:08.614 --> 24:10.616
No, it's "nipples"
and the word "and,"

24:10.700 --> 24:13.035
A-N-D, "toes23."

24:13.119 --> 24:15.872
- So Nipples, A-N-D, toes.
- Yes.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.832
- So Nipples...
- AndToes.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.000
- Twenty-three.
- So...

24:19.083 --> 24:21.252
NipplesAndToes23.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.212
- Yeah!
- Got the nipples. Got the toes.

24:23.296 --> 24:25.214
I think it's very clear
what her username is.

24:34.682 --> 24:36.225
- Hey, Dev.
- What?

24:36.309 --> 24:38.436
Do you mind scooting to the
floor so I can stretch?

24:38.561 --> 24:39.729
Sure.

24:39.812 --> 24:40.938
Thank you.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.151
- DD.
- Yeah.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.069
Can you pass me the blanket?

24:51.491 --> 24:53.075
You good?

24:55.536 --> 24:58.372
Ooh, I'm so comfy, so cozy.

24:58.456 --> 25:00.291
Hey, I'm glad you're
all cozy and comfy,

25:00.374 --> 25:02.585
but you mind not talking
so much during the movie?

25:02.668 --> 25:04.378
Yeah, babe, this, like,
a really intense part.

25:04.462 --> 25:05.379
Get the fuck up!

25:05.463 --> 25:06.547
Sorry.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.342
Get the fuck up, boy!

25:09.425 --> 25:11.135
Get up, asshole!

25:11.219 --> 25:12.470
Keep faking it!

25:12.553 --> 25:13.554
Get up, asshole!

25:13.638 --> 25:15.389
Wait, one more thing.

25:15.473 --> 25:16.933
- DD.
- Yeah.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.768
Can you make me your
special chocolate milk?

25:18.851 --> 25:20.853
I'll get your milk. I'm
getting up anyway.

25:20.937 --> 25:23.189
DD, tell him your recipe.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.024
Denise, what's the recipe?

25:25.107 --> 25:26.734
I just do what's on the
back of the bottle, dude.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.528
Don't seem too special.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.120
Dev.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.331
Who the hell is this girl?

25:40.414 --> 25:41.415
I don't know.

25:41.499 --> 25:42.792
I just met her tonight,
but I feel like

25:42.875 --> 25:45.503
I've already seen her naked,
even though she's fully clothed.

25:45.586 --> 25:48.089
- She's a thot, right?
- What's a thot?

25:48.172 --> 25:49.840
A T-H-O-T.

25:49.924 --> 25:52.260
"That ho over there."

25:52.343 --> 25:53.761
Oh.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.179
- It's an acronym.
- You know what?

25:55.263 --> 25:57.723
I'm not in love with this
whole lesbian thing,

25:57.807 --> 26:00.977
but I at least want my child to
date a girl who got some sense.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.895
What happened to Michelle?

26:02.979 --> 26:04.772
Michelle wanted them
to move in together.

26:04.855 --> 26:05.773
Denise wasn't ready.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.234
They got into a big
fight, and they broke up.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.443
That sounds familiar.

26:09.527 --> 26:12.154
Well, shit, I don't believe
in shacking either.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.032
Mm, mm, mm.

26:16.117 --> 26:19.203
Does anybody know why the hell
she keep calling Denise "DD"?

26:19.287 --> 26:21.539
Where is the second
D coming from?

26:21.622 --> 26:22.748
And for the record,

26:22.832 --> 26:25.334
I'm about to make this grown
woman some chocolate milk.

26:25.418 --> 26:27.211
Fill me up.

26:42.977 --> 26:43.853
Yo, man.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.271
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.564
Got to say,

26:46.647 --> 26:48.190
I'm glad Michelle's
coming through this year.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.817
We don't have to deal with Nikki.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.944
Although the nickname DD was
starting to grow on me.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.904
Okay, dude, don't
ever call me that.

26:53.988 --> 26:55.072
So how's everything
with Michelle?

26:55.156 --> 26:56.532
Things good since you
guys got back together?

26:56.616 --> 26:59.118
Yeah, man, it's really good. We
got a couples therapist now.

26:59.201 --> 27:00.453
Learning how to
communicate better.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.747
- Learned about love languages.
- Mm, love languages.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.081
Yeah, dude, it's a thing.

27:04.165 --> 27:05.541
We're really on a high right now

27:05.625 --> 27:07.126
'cause I killed it
for her birthday.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.377
What'd you do?

27:08.461 --> 27:09.503
Well, a friend of
mine's a chef, right?

27:09.587 --> 27:11.672
So he came over and cooked a
little nice, intimate meal

27:11.756 --> 27:13.633
for me and five of
her closest friends.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.676
Yeah, we lit candles, all that.
Super fly.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.678
- Mm, I see you.
- You know how I do.

27:17.762 --> 27:19.847
Before the night was over, I
had New Edition come through

27:19.930 --> 27:22.475
and sing her favorite song,
"Can You Stand the Rain."

27:22.558 --> 27:24.060
What? How'd you get New Edition?

27:24.143 --> 27:25.353
Oh, I didn't get the
real New Edition.

27:25.478 --> 27:29.231
Got the New Edition cover band,
New Addition, A-D-D-I-T-I-O-N.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.941
- Mm, love the name.
- Yeah.

27:31.025 --> 27:33.027
The Filipino Johnny
Gill was no joke.

27:33.903 --> 27:34.904
Yeah.

27:36.030 --> 27:37.657
Oh, I should go.

28:42.638 --> 28:45.182
So Dev and Denise never
help with the cooking?

28:45.933 --> 28:49.103
Unless you count Dev's
macaroni taste test,

28:49.145 --> 28:50.730
then, no.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.650
Well, I'd love to help.

28:58.028 --> 28:59.029
Oh.

28:59.113 --> 29:00.448
Well, uh...

29:00.531 --> 29:03.492
grab that platter and plate
some of the cornbread for me.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.669
I like that outfit
you got Denise.

29:15.004 --> 29:17.381
Yeah, um...

29:17.465 --> 29:20.384
it's nice to mix it up so she's
not always wearing sweatpants

29:20.468 --> 29:21.844
and a hat that says "Ratch."

29:25.014 --> 29:26.766
Yeah, well...

29:28.726 --> 29:31.854
I remember when she was
in the eighth grade.

29:31.937 --> 29:36.817
She wore a John Starks Knicks
jersey to school the whole year.

29:36.901 --> 29:40.237
Then she spilled gravy all over it, and
she still wore it for another month.

29:42.072 --> 29:44.241
I had to sneak up in
her room and take it

29:44.325 --> 29:45.993
to give it to the Goodwill.

29:46.076 --> 29:47.161
That's good to know.

29:47.244 --> 29:49.789
I might just have to spill some
gravy on that "Ratch" hat.

29:51.081 --> 29:53.375
I know that's right.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.544
What y'all in here laughing about?

29:55.628 --> 29:57.087
Don't you worry about it.

29:57.171 --> 29:58.672
I'm just gonna take this out.

29:58.756 --> 29:59.590
Thank you.

30:01.050 --> 30:04.595
I think this is gonna be a
lovely Thanksgiving, Denise.

30:04.678 --> 30:06.430
Yeah, I think so.

30:06.514 --> 30:08.891
And, uh, I like Michelle.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.937
I like her, too.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.363
I'm happy for you.

30:24.073 --> 30:26.242
Guys, I just got a
text from Nikki.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.203
Um, she's kicking it with that bulldog
that skateboards through people's legs.

30:29.286 --> 30:32.081
They're close by, wondering
if they can roll through.

30:32.164 --> 30:35.084
DD, you want to get the
chocolate milk ready?

30:35.167 --> 30:36.710
Okay.

30:36.794 --> 30:39.338
So I'm just never gonna
live that down, huh?

30:39.421 --> 30:40.589
Hey, I was nice to her.

30:40.673 --> 30:41.924
I made her chocolate milk.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.384
Yeah, but you ain't do the
right recipe, though.

30:43.467 --> 30:44.844
You messed up the ratio.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.637
You put too much of
the powder in there.

30:49.223 --> 30:50.683
So, Dev,
do you come over

30:50.766 --> 30:51.600
for every Thanksgiving?

30:51.684 --> 30:53.561
Oh, yeah. He's here every year.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.104
Since he was a little boy.

30:55.187 --> 30:58.399
The two of them playing
upstairs with toys.

30:58.482 --> 30:59.733
Then when they was teenagers,

30:59.817 --> 31:01.694
smoking weed and
playing 'intendo.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.821
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, please.

31:03.904 --> 31:06.991
I found one of your sad
little blunts in the trash.

31:07.074 --> 31:08.784
It was depressing.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.077
I smoked it, though.

31:11.495 --> 31:12.663
Wait, so you guys knew?

31:12.746 --> 31:14.248
Coming down to
dinner all bug-eyed

31:14.331 --> 31:16.375
and smelling like
lemon air freshener.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.168
Thinking y'all was slick.
Please.

31:19.295 --> 31:21.505
What are y'all laughing about?

31:21.589 --> 31:22.840
Go ahead.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.925
So, Grandma, when
we were teenagers,

31:25.009 --> 31:26.719
we used to go upstairs
and smoke weed,

31:26.802 --> 31:28.554
and we didn't think they
knew, but they did!

31:28.637 --> 31:30.806
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.766
The whole house
smelled like reefer.

31:36.145 --> 31:38.314
Can we say grace?
