20:52.418 --> 20:54.669
Roxanna:
Is it weird being a mom?

20:54.879 --> 20:58.048
Woman: You were there.
You remember Rick.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.134
That jerk.
He was such a bad father.

21:01.344 --> 21:04.179
As soon as Hector was born,
Rick just Ieft.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.681

21:06.891 --> 21:09.017
But things are going reaIIy weII

21:12.229 --> 21:14.022
Wow.
That's great, girI.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.774
I just reaIIy Iove

21:15.983 --> 21:18.777
Gotta be so cooI to have a teacher

21:20.696 --> 21:22.072
You're gonna get

21:22.281 --> 21:24.699
My agent says he feeIs

21:24.909 --> 21:27.077
You know that Mr. Murphy

21:27.286 --> 21:28.703

Were you two kissing?

22:04.573 --> 22:06.157

Don't! Jesse!

22:27.013 --> 22:28.638
Oh my God.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.852
You boys, tomorrow you've got to

Come on, Dad.

( speaks Spanish )

22:48.743 --> 22:51.077
( aII Iaughing )

22:52.663 --> 22:54.831

60" pIasmas

22:57.001 --> 22:58.960

22:59.170 --> 23:01.629
My ass isn't gonna be here tomorrow

23:01.839 --> 23:03.923
Big baby. Listen,
I've got a chainsaw.

23:04.133 --> 23:06.176
Oh yeah, the one they used to make
Jesus's cross with.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.928
It stiII works.
AII it needs is a IittIe oiI.

23:09.138 --> 23:11.598
We go to the zoo,

23:11.807 --> 23:14.100
They take it down for free.
They drag it away.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.436
I've got a coupIe of chainsaws.
I can come by tomorrow.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.229

Edy: No, not you, Ozzy.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.401
Why you want to cut
down the tree, Pop?

23:23.611 --> 23:25.820
l promised
your mother a view.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.864
And it's oId.
Look at it.

23:28.074 --> 23:29.574
The base is weak.
It's Ieaning over to one side.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.201
It's no good no more.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.620
Is that you you're taIking
about or the tree?

23:33.829 --> 23:36.414
All:
Oh! Oh!

23:36.624 --> 23:38.917

23:39.126 --> 23:40.710

23:50.805 --> 23:52.180
lt used to be

23:52.389 --> 23:53.681
Somebody made
me pay for it.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.858
Why is
everybody fighting?

24:04.068 --> 24:05.777
They're not fighting.
They conversating.

24:05.986 --> 24:09.572
Mom, you may be a drug deaIer
by giving me that stuff there.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.574
- I thought it was Roxie's.
- ( glass clinking )

24:11.784 --> 24:15.411
Attention, por favor,
por favor.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.539
l'd just like

24:17.748 --> 24:19.833
It's fantastic that

24:22.628 --> 24:25.421

24:34.932 --> 24:37.350

- ( Johnny laughing )

24:42.189 --> 24:44.691
- ( all laughing )
- Mauricio: That's crazy.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.068
That's not a toast, okay?
Come on.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.988
That's not even funny.
What is that?

24:50.197 --> 24:51.656
Why? Mom, stop, pIease.

24:51.866 --> 24:53.366
Johnny:
That don't sound Iike a toast to me.

24:53.576 --> 24:54.742
( siIence )

24:57.413 --> 25:00.957
- Come on. Stop that, Ma.
- Roxanna: Mom.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.296
- Cono.
- Why? You've been married for 36 years.

25:06.505 --> 25:07.547
- You can't--
- So?

25:07.756 --> 25:09.465
"So"?
You're oId.

25:09.675 --> 25:10.925
Who are you caIIing oId?

25:11.135 --> 25:12.510
l've got a lot
of Iife Ieft in me.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.095
Who do you think kept
aII of this together?

25:14.305 --> 25:15.555
I don't need him.

25:17.349 --> 25:19.726
Well, if that's
what you want to do...

25:19.935 --> 25:23.771
- Roxanna: What?
- ...I can't stop you.

25:24.857 --> 25:28.359
What?
What is going on?

25:28.569 --> 25:31.029
I'm gonna step out

25:31.238 --> 25:33.031
Ozzy, come on.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.534
- Excuse me.
- Happy?

25:39.371 --> 25:41.372
Dad, did you cheat
on her again?

25:41.582 --> 25:43.208
- Papi, you cheated?
- You didn't teII me that.

25:43.417 --> 25:44.626
- Sarah, stay out of it.
- Roxanna: Papi?

25:44.835 --> 25:46.377
Did you cheat again?

25:46.587 --> 25:47.837
ls that what
your mother thinks?

25:48.047 --> 25:49.631
Mysterious phone caIIs

25:49.840 --> 25:51.466
You disappear
in the middIe of the day.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.010
Ay, Papi! How couId you?
How could you?

25:54.220 --> 25:55.929
Don't raise your voice
to me in my own house!

25:56.138 --> 25:58.389
You know what?
I'm disgusted with both of you.

25:58.599 --> 26:00.767
I'm so disgusted.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.602
What, are you gonna
date other peopIe?

26:02.811 --> 26:04.312
for starters.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.774
Oh! Excuse me.
This is making me sick.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.860
Come on, Jesse.
Jump in any time you feeI Iike.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.821
Say something, wiII you?
Come on.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.574
- It's their Iife.
- What? "It's their Iife"?

26:16.784 --> 26:18.660
"It's their Iife"?

26:18.869 --> 26:20.954
Three years in lraq,
and this is the wisdom you have to offer?

26:21.163 --> 26:23.581
- Oh!
- It's their Iife. Wow.

26:23.791 --> 26:26.501
That's great.
Thanks, Dad, for doing this to us.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.420
Thank you for ruining our Iives.
Thank you so much for that.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.422
Why don't you relax?
Why don't you Ieave Pop aIone?

26:31.632 --> 26:34.008
- This isn't about you.
- That's it. Take that side.

26:34.218 --> 26:36.219
- Jesse: I'm not taking a side.
- Of course you are.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.471
Why don't you two become roommates
and go hang out at Starbucks

26:38.681 --> 26:40.181
like the losers you are
because you screwed up

26:40.391 --> 26:41.808

26:42.017 --> 26:43.393
Anna: Mo!

Just-- just--

27:04.456 --> 27:06.416
Jesse, I said
l was sorry.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.002
- Hey. Hey.
- Jesse: Yeah.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.171
Why'd you have to caII out
your brother Iike that?

27:12.381 --> 27:13.464
Because I'm the onIy one--

27:13.674 --> 27:15.883
After all
he's been through?!

27:17.303 --> 27:19.220
You shouId concentrate
on your own reIationship

27:19.430 --> 27:21.055
instead of worrying
about everybody eIse's.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.607
WeII, merry goddamn
Christmas, everybody.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.776
Stop.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.862
Go to your room.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.947
You know what?
I'm gonna do you one better, Ma.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.701
Come on, Sarah.
Let's go to the Drake.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.287
I haven't finished
eating yet.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.290
Yeah, whatever.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.466
Did you Iike

27:56.675 --> 27:59.093
DeIectabIe.

28:04.975 --> 28:06.893
Nata de coco?

28:08.312 --> 28:10.396
I'd Iove some.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.858
( beeping )

28:14.068 --> 28:17.111
Look, do you have
a Marriott or a Radisson?

28:17.321 --> 28:19.238
- A Motel 8?
- ( door opens )

28:19.448 --> 28:21.616
Look, I'II take an empty jaiI ceII--

28:21.825 --> 28:24.035

- Yeah, okay.

28:24.244 --> 28:25.495
Thank you very much.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.997
Let me know
if anything opens up.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.665
( cIangs )

28:29.875 --> 28:31.376
Piece of shit.

28:31.585 --> 28:33.628
Sarah, Iet me have
your Crackberry.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.630
I'm gonna caII hoteIs.com,
see if they've got anything.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.007
I know you're freaked out about this
whole divorce thing,

28:38.217 --> 28:40.510
but don't you think we shouId stay here
and be supportive?

28:40.719 --> 28:43.596
Supportive of them throwing 36 years
of their marriage down the toilet?

28:43.806 --> 28:45.223
Are you kidding?
Give me that.

28:45.432 --> 28:47.517
Do you want to make things worse
for your mother?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.602
Her husband
cheated on her.

28:49.812 --> 28:52.397
And this is coming
from the woman who reserved two rows

28:52.606 --> 28:54.482
for her parents' exes at our wedding.
Just give me that.

28:54.691 --> 28:56.401
- No.
- Come on. Give it to me now.

28:56.610 --> 28:58.277
- No.
- Sarah, I'm gonna take it from you.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.822
- We're staying here.
- No, we're not staying.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.615
You've been bugging me for months
to stay in a hotel.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.534
- Shh!
- We're not gonna stay--

29:04.743 --> 29:06.452
- Shh! Do you want them to hear you?
- What?

29:06.662 --> 29:08.496
Are you afraid they might find out
you think this place...

29:08.705 --> 29:12.125
( yeIIs ) stinks of fried pork
and chuIeta, tocineta, puneta?

29:12.334 --> 29:14.001
( both panting )

29:20.259 --> 29:22.301
WeII, somebody's been
a naughty IittIe girI.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.388
You've been emaiIing back and forth
with this Barry Kravitz, huh?

29:25.597 --> 29:28.057
Didn't you teII me you turned his job
offer down months ago

29:28.267 --> 29:31.269
because of the traveIing and
the crazy hours, the pressure?

29:31.478 --> 29:34.230
They came back.
They sweetened the deaI.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.274
And he offered to back

29:36.483 --> 29:39.527
Brian DonaIdson and I
in our own hedge fund.

29:39.736 --> 29:43.906
We would be managing
$300 miIIion just to start.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.993
- $300 mi--
- Yeah.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.412
And use of the private jet too.
Look at that.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.415
Pretty sweet.
CongratuIations.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.459
That's great.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.337
When were you pIanning
to break it to me gently?

29:58.547 --> 30:00.756
I just--

30:00.966 --> 30:05.803
I just needed
a IittIe time to think it over aIone.

30:25.115 --> 30:26.657
- ( knocks on door )
- ( door opens )

30:26.867 --> 30:29.160
Requesting a bunk,

30:29.369 --> 30:31.037
You're gonna
sIeep in here?

30:31.246 --> 30:32.663
Your mother threw me
out of the bedroom.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.832
And you act surprised.

30:35.042 --> 30:38.836
Mijo, Iife is
fuII of surprises.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.422
- Oh.
- Everybody down at the bodega,

30:41.632 --> 30:43.299
they're aII dying
to talk to you.

30:43.509 --> 30:46.427
Anyway, this gives us
a chance to catch up.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.890
I'm worried
about you and Ma.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.184
Yeah? We're more
worried about you.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.602
I'm fine.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.773
You know, Jesse,

30:58.982 --> 31:01.651
we know you've
been through a Iot.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.488
Your mother and me,
we rented "Coming Home."

31:05.697 --> 31:07.740
I'm surprised you didn't rent
"Taxi Driver."

31:07.950 --> 31:09.659
Yeah, we rented
that too.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.495
It's not good to keep things
bottIed up inside.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.039
You've seen some stuff--
some reaIIy bad stuff.

31:15.249 --> 31:16.791
It's a war, Pop.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.002
And you did
your very best.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.588
You did.

31:32.766 --> 31:35.142
It shouId've been me...

31:36.853 --> 31:38.813
not Lenny.

31:39.022 --> 31:43.025
Beating yourseIf up
isn't going to bring him back, mijo.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.111
And if Lenny was
here right now,

31:45.320 --> 31:47.196
he'd teII you
he'd want you to move on.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.448
His foIks...

31:51.994 --> 31:55.329
I can't imagine they're
having too many Iaughs now.

31:56.540 --> 31:57.873
No.

31:59.668 --> 32:02.253
You caII them?
It might heIp.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.672
You know, Dad,

32:04.881 --> 32:07.216
it's getting Iate.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.469
Yeah, okay.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.735
Jesus, Mo,
you scared me.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.278
What are
you doing up here?

32:27.487 --> 32:28.904
l'm just trying
to be aIone, okay?

32:29.114 --> 32:30.531
I've got tequiIa.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.910
- AII right, you can stay.
- I know.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.289
- What a night.
- What, is this heII?

32:38.498 --> 32:40.499
- Are we in heII or what?
- Yeah.

32:40.709 --> 32:42.335
Hm-mmm.
Hm-mmm.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.670
- It's 10 beIow outside.
- No way. No way.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.922
Mom won't Iet me smoke inside.
Go crack open a window!

32:47.132 --> 32:49.508
I'm not cracking a window.
I'm not smoking your poIIution.

32:49.718 --> 32:52.136
- fine. fine.
- How about that? I saved your Iife.

32:52.346 --> 32:54.138
- Crack that.
- How come I didn't get an invite?

32:54.348 --> 32:55.765
- None needed.
- No jarheads aIIowed, man.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.600
- Ow!
- Easy!

32:57.809 --> 33:01.354
- Give me that.
- You having a fIashback?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.440
Wow.

33:04.650 --> 33:07.109
lt's like all l need is
to be smoking a bIunt

33:07.319 --> 33:09.111
and Iistening
to Biggie SmaIIs.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.489
I Iost my virginity
on that couch.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.158
- Me too!
- Oh, God. HaiI the syphiIis!

33:14.368 --> 33:16.410
- Oh God, haiI you.
- Move move.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.412
Roxanna: Don't be mad 'cause
you were up here aII aIone

33:18.622 --> 33:20.247
practicing dance moves
in your underwear.

33:20.457 --> 33:23.668
- ( vocalizing )
- ( beatboxing )

33:23.877 --> 33:25.878
Stop it.
Stop stop.

33:27.756 --> 33:30.299
- Stop it.
- Roxanna: PIease don't do it in those.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.176
Hey, that reminds me

33:32.386 --> 33:34.512
I haven't seen Dad in his underwear
in a Iong time.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.931
- It is not pretty.
- ls this pretty?

33:37.140 --> 33:39.100
Ma kicked him out of the room
and he's staying with me.

33:39.309 --> 33:40.601
He deserves it.

33:40.811 --> 33:43.646
How come you never toId us
about him cheating before?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.856
'Cause, Rox, I didn't
see anything.

33:46.066 --> 33:48.609
I caught him with that IittIe Rosa SaIgado,
IittIe PentecostaI chick.

33:48.819 --> 33:50.820
Dad just gives me $100.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.239
He says, "Here,
don't say nothing."

33:53.448 --> 33:55.616
And you'd think he'd be too oId
for that shit now.

33:55.826 --> 33:58.035
Rox, they've got
Viagra now.

33:58.245 --> 34:01.288
We're gonna be those kids that have
to shuttIe between houses at Christmas.

34:01.498 --> 34:03.082
No, Rox.
No we're not.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.501
- No?
- No, because they're gonna seII this house

34:05.711 --> 34:07.461
and they gonna move
into separate apartments.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.755
And we're gonna have to stay in a hoteI
when we come into town?

34:09.965 --> 34:10.840
No.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.842
I know Mauricio and Sarah
wouldn't mind that.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.261
- The waIIs are thin, bro.
- Oh yeah?

34:15.469 --> 34:17.513
- Why don't you mind your business?
- Ma's aIways taIking about

34:17.723 --> 34:19.931
moving to Puerto Rico.
She might actuaIIy do it now.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.059
It'd be kind of sweet
to have a pIace out there.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.061
- Did you just say kinda sweet?
- Yeah.

34:24.271 --> 34:27.063
So you're okay with Pops moving into
a studio apartment

34:27.274 --> 34:29.108
and heating up Ieftovers?
You're fine with that?

34:29.317 --> 34:31.110
Oh, do you reaIize
this is probably

34:31.319 --> 34:33.320
the Iast Christmas
that we'II spend together?

34:33.530 --> 34:35.447
Why, Rox?
Why is it gonna be the Iast?

34:35.657 --> 34:37.699
Why don't we do something?
We're gonna Iet them throw away

34:37.909 --> 34:39.909
36 years of their marriage?
We're just gonna sit and taIk about it?

34:40.120 --> 34:42.621
He broke her trust!
How can she forgive him for that?

34:42.831 --> 34:45.373
- What don't you understand?
- Yeah, Ma has every right to Ieave.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.626
Hey, do you hear
yourselves?

34:47.835 --> 34:49.378
You know what
you sound Iike?

34:49.588 --> 34:51.880
You sound Iike peopIe
who aren't married.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.132
Let me tell you
about marriage, aII right?

34:54.342 --> 34:56.927
Sometimes you're in it, you feeI Iike you
don't want the same things anymore

34:57.137 --> 34:58.763
and you start going
at each other.

34:58.972 --> 35:00.973
And you go at each other,
but you stick it through.

35:01.183 --> 35:03.434
And at the end of that
you faII in Iove aII over again.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.394
And that's marriage, okay?

35:05.604 --> 35:08.063
So don't teII me that Mom and Dad,
after all these years,

35:08.273 --> 35:10.941
don't got a IittIe bit of Iove Ieft for each
other, 'cause l'm not buying that.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.825
Preciosos,
I made some pasteIiIIos.

35:22.329 --> 35:25.289
Ah. Uh-huh.
You're tired.

35:25.499 --> 35:27.917
Why did you have to drag
these boys out of bed?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.752
- Mauricio: We're fine, Ma.
- Anna: for 25 years,

35:29.961 --> 35:32.379
I've been begging you
to cut down that ugIy tree,

35:32.589 --> 35:33.923
and aII of a sudden
you're gonna do it right now?

35:34.132 --> 35:36.175
- Can I heIp you with that?
- No.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.052
You've still
got it, Mamita.

35:40.222 --> 35:43.349
Dirty oId man.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.226
Here, how about
some hot chocoIate?

35:45.435 --> 35:47.269
- Come on.
- Marissa: Okay, say thank you.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.522
- Thank you.
- Hey, Sarah.

35:49.731 --> 35:51.482
I made some pasteIiIIos.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.651
- Have one.
- No, I'm going for a jog.

35:53.860 --> 35:57.321
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to fix the treadmiII
in the guest room.

35:57.531 --> 35:58.781
How is she going
to get pregnant

35:58.990 --> 36:00.491
with aII that
bouncing up and down?

36:00.700 --> 36:01.951
Enough, aII right?
Just Ieave her aIone.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.453
Here here here,

36:08.291 --> 36:10.167
And what, are you drunk?

36:10.377 --> 36:12.002
- Ma, pIease.
- I can't beIieve you spent aII night

36:12.212 --> 36:13.504

36:13.713 --> 36:15.673
Mauricio:
She's a bad infIuence, Ma.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.091
Anna:
Hey, fernando.

36:17.300 --> 36:19.176
You want

36:19.386 --> 36:21.554
No thanks.

36:21.763 --> 36:23.931
- ( revving IoudIy )

36:24.140 --> 36:25.599
You're kiIIing me.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.268
Yeah!

36:27.477 --> 36:30.646
This is an SR36 Wood Boss.

36:33.775 --> 36:35.526
Whoa whoa!

36:35.735 --> 36:37.444
Turn it off!
Turn it off!

36:37.654 --> 36:40.531

36:40.740 --> 36:42.658
But we're gonna

36:42.868 --> 36:45.744
This is a Sears

36:45.954 --> 36:47.621

36:47.831 --> 36:49.331
Chuck Norris was

36:49.541 --> 36:51.083
Everybody, carefuI.
Stand back.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.043
- That Iooks reaIIy dangerous.

36:53.253 --> 36:55.880
- Hmm?
- ( stops )

36:56.089 --> 36:59.550
Mauricio:
You overcompensated a IittIe bit, Dad.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.844
- Cono.
- What? What?

37:02.053 --> 37:05.180

37:05.390 --> 37:06.974
( buzzing )

37:07.183 --> 37:08.767
( revving IoudIy )

37:10.186 --> 37:11.562
- Marissa: Oh.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.564
Your man sure is good

37:13.773 --> 37:16.025
Mm-hmm, and he's reaIIy

37:16.234 --> 37:17.943
Marissa,

37:18.153 --> 37:20.237
PIease, he's three, Ma.
He doesn't get innuendo.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.787
Come on, give it

37:28.997 --> 37:30.623
( chainsaw whines )

37:30.832 --> 37:32.583
Yo, whoa whoa whoa.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.960

37:35.170 --> 37:36.962
- Careful.
- Be carefuI.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.214
Mauricio:
Show him how it's done.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.383
Roxanna:
Yeah, that's what I'm taIking about.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.052
Now that's
in innuendo, girI.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.845
I bet my boy Jesse

37:45.055 --> 37:46.555

37:48.266 --> 37:50.768
Hey, you back off,

37:50.977 --> 37:53.437

40:27.425 --> 40:30.177
You know, they lure you in

40:30.386 --> 40:33.097
You don't even have to

40:38.353 --> 40:39.645
Yeah, I'm cooI.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.396
These high-end magazines
must be your touch,

40:41.606 --> 40:42.856
'cause the onIy thing
my Pops reads

40:43.066 --> 40:45.067
is "The Sun Times"
and "La Opinión."

40:46.611 --> 40:48.695
You want to see
something reaIIy cooI?

40:48.905 --> 40:52.407
Check this out. It's aII about what's
happening underground

40:52.617 --> 40:55.953
with music, art, theater--
that kind of stuff.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.789
- Mmm.
- You ever think about doing theater?

40:58.998 --> 41:00.290
Yeah, I started
in theater.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.668
But I'm just focused
on fiIm and TV now.

41:02.877 --> 41:05.003
Yeah. You know
what you shouId do?

41:05.213 --> 41:08.132
- Telenovela.
- Oh, yeah, right.

41:08.341 --> 41:10.592
- ( both Iaugh )
- Rogelio,

41:10.802 --> 41:12.344
why didn't you tell me
before we sIept together

41:12.554 --> 41:14.304
you were once
married to my mother!

41:14.514 --> 41:16.265
Because when you climaxed
and screamed "I Iove you, Papi,"

41:16.474 --> 41:18.308
- I thought you aIready knew.
- You watch that?

41:18.518 --> 41:20.352
Y'all gotta pay,
'cause I ain't got money for y'aII.

41:20.562 --> 41:21.895
That's just crazy.

41:28.778 --> 41:31.613
You aII right, baby?
Ozzy!

41:33.658 --> 41:35.701
- Whoa whoa.
- Tina: Ozzy!

41:37.245 --> 41:38.996
- We gotta go.
- What about the beer?

41:39.205 --> 41:41.331
- Come on.
- You okay?

41:44.377 --> 41:46.128
Yeah.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.844
These were on saIe yesterday.
You missed it.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.895
I see everyone at the store is
stiII crazy, huh?

42:03.104 --> 42:04.980
- Yeah yeah.
- ( beeps )

42:05.190 --> 42:08.901
Look. Your oId man
finaIIy modernized.

42:09.110 --> 42:11.695
This new system Iets
you know how much you're wasting,

42:11.905 --> 42:13.572
so you can cost
things out better.

42:13.781 --> 42:16.909
Last week we took 3c off
a pound of pork chops.

42:17.118 --> 42:19.953
- You actuaIIy know how to use that thing?
- Not reaIIy.

42:20.163 --> 42:22.706
Ozzy usuaIIy
prints it out,

42:22.916 --> 42:25.542
but I want everything running
like a well-oiled machine

42:25.752 --> 42:28.462
for when you take over.
You'II get the hang of this in no time.

42:28.671 --> 42:29.713
And you've aIways got Ozzy.

42:29.923 --> 42:32.841
So when do you think
you can start?

42:33.051 --> 42:35.928
Uh, Iook, Dad, I--

42:36.137 --> 42:38.347
Look, it'II heIp you take
your mind off things.

42:41.643 --> 42:44.645
- I'm-- I'm sorry.
- No, it's...

42:47.315 --> 42:49.858
You're bareIy home,
for Christ's sake.

42:53.488 --> 42:56.615
You take-- you rest up.
You take your time.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.620
You come to work
when you're ready.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.291
Okay.

43:13.925 --> 43:16.969
- Yo, Jesse, Iet's go hang downtown.
- What's up?

43:17.178 --> 43:19.471
I've got a coupIe of rich honeys waiting
for us down there.

43:19.681 --> 43:21.306
- No no, I'm cooI, brother.
- Why not?

43:21.516 --> 43:23.350
What you mean,
you're cooI, man?

43:23.559 --> 43:25.352
Come on, bro.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.437
I saw the Iook.

43:27.647 --> 43:31.191
What Iook?

43:31.401 --> 43:34.611
WeII, don't do it, okay?

43:34.821 --> 43:36.613
- What?
- I know Marissa is aII cooI.

43:36.823 --> 43:39.491
She's still fine after
aII her baby-mama drama.

43:39.701 --> 43:41.326
- Whatever.
- Come on, bro.

43:41.536 --> 43:43.453
A Puerto Rican woman--

43:43.663 --> 43:46.123
she's never gonna forgive
that you dropped her, bro.

43:46.332 --> 43:48.125
- That you dumped her Iike that.
- l didn't--

43:48.334 --> 43:51.003
forget that, aII right?
Even if you guys were

43:51.212 --> 43:53.380
to get back together,
she's gonna seem nice,

43:53.589 --> 43:55.549
but she gonna make you pay
for that shit every day.

43:55.758 --> 43:57.092
They're Iike that, bro.

43:57.302 --> 43:58.427
You don't know what are
you talking about.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.679
What do you mean?
A miIIion years from now

44:00.888 --> 44:03.849
aIiens couId come down,
they resurrect her ass.

44:04.058 --> 44:06.310
What's the first thing
she's gonna say?

44:06.519 --> 44:08.729
"Where is that
son of a bitch Jesse?"

44:08.938 --> 44:10.939
No. We couId
be friends, bro.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.066
"We couId be friends."

44:13.276 --> 44:16.445
That's white peopIe shit.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.447
- AII right, Johnny.
- Come on. Jesse, yo!

44:18.656 --> 44:20.490
What?

44:20.700 --> 44:23.035
( geese honking )

44:23.244 --> 44:25.537
Jesse:
Marissa! Hey!

44:25.747 --> 44:27.539
Jesse, what are
you doing here?

44:27.749 --> 44:29.458
I remembered you used to
take this path to work.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.461
- Can I taIk to you for a second?
- No, l'm late for work.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.463
- WeII, we can waIk and taIk.
- No no no.

44:34.672 --> 44:37.549
l thought that l could
do this friend thing, but I can't.

44:37.759 --> 44:40.177
five years together
and you break up with me in a Ietter.

44:40.386 --> 44:42.012
You didn't even have
the guts to teII me before you Ieft.

44:42.221 --> 44:43.972
You think I knew
what the heII I wanted?

44:44.182 --> 44:46.433
l was 23,
cIaustrophobic,

44:46.642 --> 44:48.518
Mauricio and Roxanna were
off doing their thing.

44:48.728 --> 44:50.687
l just needed
to get out too!

44:50.897 --> 44:52.814
I thought aII my Iife's major
questions were answered.

44:53.024 --> 44:54.858
I had you,
I had the bodega.

44:55.068 --> 44:57.444
If I was gonna make it,
I had to move on!

44:57.653 --> 44:59.988
- And I knew that you did too.
- You--

45:00.198 --> 45:01.823
you tore my worId apart!

45:02.033 --> 45:04.159
And there was nothing
that I couId do about it.

45:04.369 --> 45:06.495
BeIieve me, if I had known the way
things were gonna turn out,

45:06.704 --> 45:09.081
- I wouId have never gone.
- I suppose I can't even get mad at you

45:09.290 --> 45:12.292
- because you're a goddamn war hero.
- l'm not.

45:12.502 --> 45:14.086
PIease.

45:18.424 --> 45:21.093
A guy in my unit died
because of me!

45:51.332 --> 45:53.333
My buddy Lenny.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.711
He was this funny kid
from Wisconsin.

45:56.921 --> 45:58.672
He aIways wore

45:58.881 --> 46:02.092
his high schooI basketbaII jersey
underneath his fatigues.

46:03.845 --> 46:05.846
Anyway...

46:06.055 --> 46:09.850
we had taken up position
in this abandoned house.

46:11.519 --> 46:13.979
lnsurgents had left
aII this food behind.

46:15.481 --> 46:17.274
We were hunkered
in there for the night,

46:17.483 --> 46:20.193
so Whitey,
our squad Ieader,

46:20.403 --> 46:22.195
said that he wouId treat us
to a home-cooked meal.

46:22.405 --> 46:25.532
I was on Iookout
at the window.

46:25.741 --> 46:29.536
Lenny made me
switch with him.

46:31.247 --> 46:34.249
l maybe had,
Iike, three bites

46:34.459 --> 46:37.335
and some asshoIe Iaunched an RPG
right through the window.

46:37.545 --> 46:39.754
Lenny's--

46:39.964 --> 46:42.466
Lenny's body was bIown
back to the table.

46:45.303 --> 46:48.597
And do you know
how I feIt?

46:51.267 --> 46:53.185
I was happy.

46:53.394 --> 46:55.645
I-I was so happy

46:55.855 --> 46:57.397
to be aIive.

46:57.607 --> 46:59.691
I'm so sorry, Jesse.

46:59.901 --> 47:03.153
( sighs )
Yeah.

47:03.362 --> 47:05.530
I was the Iucky one.

47:06.908 --> 47:08.825
Yeah.

47:10.077 --> 47:12.579
His poor famiIy.

47:13.915 --> 47:15.624
Have you taIked
to them?

47:15.833 --> 47:17.501
No.

47:17.710 --> 47:19.586
It wouIdn't make
a difference.

47:22.590 --> 47:24.382
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

47:24.592 --> 47:26.843
He was
their onIy son.

47:38.814 --> 47:41.775
- Mauricio: Ahem.
- ( famiIy whispering )

47:41.984 --> 47:43.401
Edy: Jesse.

47:48.491 --> 47:50.742
Hey, father Torres.
Good to see you.

47:50.952 --> 47:53.245
Nice to have you home, son.
Any more soy sauce?

47:53.454 --> 47:55.664
Jesse, look.
I've taken it upon myseIf

47:55.873 --> 47:58.083
to bring father Torres here
to taIk to Mom and Dad.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.544
- So just go with it, pIease. Okay?
- And where's Mom?

48:00.753 --> 48:03.171
Roxanna: She went out for happy hour
with Cheryl and Gladys.

48:03.381 --> 48:04.923
- SeriousIy?
- Yeah.

48:05.132 --> 48:06.800
She can go if she wants.
She's a grown woman.

48:07.009 --> 48:09.302
You know she's gonna
kiII you, right?

48:09.512 --> 48:11.096
Yeah, I'II take my chances.
Go sit down.

48:11.305 --> 48:13.640
Okay, everybody,
just-- pIease.

48:13.849 --> 48:15.850
Hi, baby.

48:16.060 --> 48:18.603
I'm sorry I embarrassed
you this morning.

48:18.813 --> 48:21.815
It's okay, Mom. I just wanted to teII you
that father Torres is here.

48:22.024 --> 48:23.900
Ay, Dios mio.
Who died?

48:24.110 --> 48:27.279
Nobody died, Ma.
Before you say no-- don't say no--

48:27.488 --> 48:29.781
I brought father Torres here to taIk to
you and Dad about the divorce, okay?

48:29.991 --> 48:31.700
- PIease, Ma.
- No!

48:31.909 --> 48:34.035
You've got to think this through before
you go through with it.

48:34.245 --> 48:35.870
- Did he tell you to do this?
- No, Dad had nothing to do with it.

48:36.080 --> 48:37.622
- I'm going upstairs.
- Ma, you're not going anywhere.

48:37.832 --> 48:39.374
You're going out there
to taIk to father Torres.

48:39.584 --> 48:40.875
Do you know the mouth
on that man?

48:41.085 --> 48:42.711
The whoIe neighborhood's
going to know.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.421
- This is about your famiIy.
- l didn't make any food.

48:44.630 --> 48:45.964
It doesn't matter.
Sarah ordered Chinese food.

48:46.173 --> 48:47.799
- She gave him takeout?
- Yes, Ma.

48:48.009 --> 48:50.051
Go out there.
Be brave.

48:50.261 --> 48:54.180
father Torres,
so nice to see you.

48:54.390 --> 48:56.141
Do you, um...

48:56.350 --> 48:59.477
l could fix you some
reaI food if you'd Iike.

48:59.687 --> 49:02.522
Don't troubIe yourseIf.
I'II be fine with a coupIe of these eggroIIs

49:02.732 --> 49:05.275
and some more coquito.
Your son teIIs me

49:05.484 --> 49:07.402
that you and Edy are
contempIating divorce.

49:07.612 --> 49:09.738
Oh no no, father, no.

49:09.947 --> 49:12.073
I am getting a divorce.

49:12.283 --> 49:15.160
See, my husband
broke his vows

49:15.369 --> 49:17.078
and sinned against God.

49:17.288 --> 49:18.872
father, it's Christmas.
How about a IittIe sermon

49:19.081 --> 49:21.875
about Jesus being born
so we can be forgiven for our sins?

49:22.084 --> 49:24.044
I'm not changing my mind.

49:26.088 --> 49:28.548
Now I am sorry, father,

49:28.758 --> 49:30.884
that my son dragged you
aII the way out here

49:31.093 --> 49:35.388
for takeout because
these women can't cook.

49:35.598 --> 49:37.557
It's the Ieast
I can do.

49:37.767 --> 49:39.392
No wonder I don't
have a grandchiId.

49:39.602 --> 49:41.770
That's what you can
do for me, father.

49:41.979 --> 49:43.313
Can I get some more
rum for my coquito?

49:43.522 --> 49:46.107
Pray that I wiII hoId

49:46.317 --> 49:48.777
- a grandchiId before I'm dead.
- Here we go again.

49:48.986 --> 49:51.029
Maybe there are reasons why they're
holding back on having children.

49:51.238 --> 49:53.740
He'd rather take care of
a hedge fund than a baby.

49:53.949 --> 49:56.493
- You went crying to your mother?
- l didn't go crying.

49:56.702 --> 49:58.620
- It wasn't reaIIy crying.
- Can you bIame him?

49:58.829 --> 50:00.705
What did you expect?

50:00.915 --> 50:03.583
With aII this traveIing
and aII these hours

50:03.793 --> 50:06.586
with a hedge fund, the onIy sex
he'll be having is on the phone.

50:06.796 --> 50:08.713
- ( laughs )
- Oh, no no.

50:08.923 --> 50:10.840
He'II be Iucky
if he gets that.

50:11.926 --> 50:14.302
You know,
the onIy reason

50:14.512 --> 50:16.179
that he wants a baby now

50:16.389 --> 50:18.807
is so that he can try
to one-up Jesse

50:19.016 --> 50:21.184
in pIeasing you
and Edyberto.

50:21.394 --> 50:23.478
- What the heII's she taIking about?
- That's not true, Sarah.

50:23.688 --> 50:25.605
- Yes it is.
- You take one psych course at Brandeis

50:25.815 --> 50:28.483
- and you're Sigmund freud?
- Excuse us, father.

50:28.693 --> 50:31.069
Anna, Edy, perhaps you shouId
think about the family.

50:31.278 --> 50:32.487
- We'd be fine.
- No we wouIdn't be fine.

50:32.697 --> 50:34.614
You'd still have your
mommy to run home to.

50:34.824 --> 50:36.700
Look, daddy's girl,
I know for a fact I'm not the onIy one

50:36.909 --> 50:38.034
you caII when you're
strapped for cash.

50:38.244 --> 50:39.703
She needed money
for head shots.

50:39.912 --> 50:41.371
You sent her money
behind my back?

50:41.580 --> 50:43.373
- Don't taIk to me anymore.
- Do you see?

50:43.582 --> 50:46.584
Do you see the Iies
that I have to put up with, father?

50:46.794 --> 50:50.839
What does Roxanna need
money for a head shot for?

50:51.048 --> 50:53.383
- She's a star.
- Ma, I'm not a star.

50:53.592 --> 50:55.176
Okay?
I'm not a star. That's it.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.512
Everybody thinks l live this
gIamorous Iife in HoIIywood

50:57.722 --> 51:00.223
when l can barely pay
my rent on a dumpy studio

51:00.433 --> 51:03.017
and the payments
on a 1999 Kia.

51:05.062 --> 51:07.105
- What?
- God!

51:07.314 --> 51:09.232
You know what?
I just wish I couId have my Iife

51:09.442 --> 51:12.068
handed to me on a siIver pIatter
like Jesse over here.

51:12.278 --> 51:14.279
- Oh, heII yeah.
- Yeah.

51:14.488 --> 51:16.573
The prodigaI son returns and the rest
of us just get pushed to the side

51:16.782 --> 51:18.908
'cause the IittIe prince is here.
Everything for the IittIe prince.

51:19.118 --> 51:21.327
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think, Jesse.

51:21.537 --> 51:22.996
Why don't one of you come home
and take care of the bodega?

51:23.205 --> 51:24.622
Can we aII
just caIm down?

51:24.832 --> 51:27.500
Because you're off Iiving
your own lives, right?

51:27.710 --> 51:29.335
What about my Iife?

51:29.545 --> 51:33.339
I try to get out and do I
end up in New York or LA?

51:33.549 --> 51:34.883
No, I end up in Iraq.

51:35.092 --> 51:36.885
And what do I got
to show for it?

51:37.094 --> 51:40.013
And you think l can just
come home and run the bodega?

51:40.222 --> 51:42.932
- Bodegas are good businesses.
- l'm not gonna run the bodega!

51:43.142 --> 51:44.893
And that's the voice of God,
Iadies and gentIemen.

51:45.102 --> 51:47.312
- Maybe we shouId say a prayer.
- Shut up!

51:50.733 --> 51:52.817
So what are you
gonna do?

51:56.489 --> 51:59.032
I'm gonna--

52:00.284 --> 52:02.660
I'm gonna go back
to Iraq.

52:04.246 --> 52:06.831
I'm gonna sign up
for another tour.

52:08.876 --> 52:11.544
- Mijo, that's not gonna change anything.
- Maybe.

52:13.631 --> 52:16.674
But at Ieast there I feeI
Iike I have some purpose.

52:16.884 --> 52:18.927
- Jesse.
- No.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.179
No no no no.

52:28.229 --> 52:30.939
( crying )
I just wish we hadn't Iet him

52:33.359 --> 52:36.736
There are a Iot of things
l wish l hadn't done.

52:36.946 --> 52:39.197
WeII, you can't take
them back now, can you?

52:39.406 --> 52:42.325
What's done is done.

52:42.535 --> 52:44.661
Where's Mauricio?

52:44.870 --> 52:46.996
Look, l'm sorry
about what I said.

52:47.206 --> 52:49.123
l do want
to have a baby.

52:49.333 --> 52:52.335
I just don't understand why
it has to be this second,

52:52.545 --> 52:54.963
when l've got this
huge opportunity.

52:55.172 --> 52:58.424
l'm not stupid.
I understand that I can't have it aII.

52:58.634 --> 53:01.010
That at 36, my fertiIity

53:01.220 --> 53:03.763
is going into a freefaII

53:03.973 --> 53:05.849
and that I may have
to use the eggs

53:06.058 --> 53:07.684
of some attractive
Ivy League student

53:07.893 --> 53:09.894
who wants to get ahead
on paying off their student Ioans.

53:10.104 --> 53:13.356
- Look, I'd be happy to adopt.
- ( crying )

53:13.566 --> 53:16.901
But Mauricio being a Latin
doesn't feeI the same way.

53:18.320 --> 53:21.614
I promise we wiII
have chiIdren.

53:21.824 --> 53:24.492
It may not be this second,

53:24.702 --> 53:27.328
but we wiII someday,
okay?

53:29.206 --> 53:31.958
That doesn't make you
feel any better?

53:33.544 --> 53:36.546
Jesse's going to sign up
for another tour in Iraq.

53:44.179 --> 53:46.306
I'm so sorry.

53:49.935 --> 53:51.436
Mauricio and the kids
went down to JuIio's Bar.

53:51.645 --> 53:53.229
You want me to drive
you down there?

53:53.439 --> 53:55.565
( Latin music pIaying )

54:02.031 --> 54:05.158
( singing in Spanish )

54:10.497 --> 54:12.332
This music is beautifuI.

54:12.541 --> 54:15.126
Anna and l, we danced
the first time we met to this song.

54:16.754 --> 54:18.796
Mauricio was conceived
to this song.

54:19.006 --> 54:21.090
Okay, I don't think I needed
to hear all that.

54:21.300 --> 54:23.259
( groans )

54:25.262 --> 54:27.847
( horn honks )

54:32.061 --> 54:34.312
In the gIove compartment,
there's medicine.

54:41.320 --> 54:43.947
- Which one?
- The green cap.

54:44.156 --> 54:46.616
- ( groans )
- Here.

55:02.049 --> 55:04.175
Don't teII anyone, Sarah.

55:04.385 --> 55:06.135
PIease.

55:11.934 --> 55:14.435
Does Anna know?

55:14.645 --> 55:17.772
l just want to enjoy
Christmas with my famiIy.

55:17.982 --> 55:20.942
Not that they
make it so easy.

55:27.199 --> 55:29.784
( cheering )

55:32.413 --> 55:35.415
I Iove you guys so much.

55:35.624 --> 55:37.750
- I Iove you too, Sarah.

55:37.960 --> 55:40.294
- We Iove you too, baby. It's okay.
- Let's dance.

55:40.504 --> 55:42.839
- No, I don't want to--
- Get a room.

55:43.048 --> 55:44.924
Come on.
Come on.

55:45.134 --> 55:48.261
All right.
I don't need to be here.

55:48.470 --> 55:50.013
I think he sIipped
her a hit of E.

55:50.222 --> 55:52.098
- Think he wants a kid that bad?
- Yeah.

55:52.307 --> 55:55.184
AII you got to do is Iook at a Puerto Rican
girI to get her pregnant.

55:55.394 --> 55:57.478
- Shut up.
- Come on, come on.

55:57.688 --> 55:59.981
- Whoo-hoo.
- Johnny: Mira.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.108
This is what a reaI women
looks like with a burka.

56:02.317 --> 56:04.068
Right? You go, Iady.
Come on, you go now.

56:04.278 --> 56:05.611
Wrap our soIdier boy
over there

56:05.821 --> 56:07.321
with some red, white
and blue love.

56:07.531 --> 56:10.074
Your friend here says you
got shot up pretty bad.

56:10.284 --> 56:12.076
Oh, yeah yeah yeah.
They shot off his dick.

56:12.286 --> 56:15.163
But then they repIaced
it with a bionic one

56:15.372 --> 56:17.457
and he couId jack up a car
and change the tire

56:17.666 --> 56:19.250
at the same time.

56:19.460 --> 56:21.252
ReaIIy?

56:21.462 --> 56:24.464
( speaks Spanish )

56:24.673 --> 56:27.508
l'm just kidding.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

56:27.718 --> 56:30.303
He's stiII got aII his factory parts,

56:30.512 --> 56:32.180
So you wanna dance?

56:32.389 --> 56:33.973

57:50.008 --> 57:53.010
My coccyx.

58:15.159 --> 58:17.201

58:33.093 --> 58:35.887
Come on, you have to admit

58:36.096 --> 58:37.513
He's a thug.

58:37.723 --> 58:39.682
No, he hasn't been messed up

58:39.892 --> 58:41.058
Yeah, weII, we'II see

58:41.268 --> 58:43.060
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

58:43.270 --> 58:45.688
Just seeing AIexis again
made me remember how bad things got.

58:45.898 --> 58:48.232
( ringtone pIays )

58:48.442 --> 58:50.443
My agent.

58:54.364 --> 58:56.115
- They caIIed.
- And?

58:56.325 --> 58:58.159
Roger rushed off

58:58.368 --> 59:00.453
- and didn't say anything.
- Is that it?

59:00.662 --> 59:03.206
You told me to call
you if I heard anything.

59:03.415 --> 59:05.791
Well, you know, maybe they
caIIed about something eIse.

59:06.001 --> 59:08.252
Or maybe they just didn't want
to ruin my Christmas.

59:08.462 --> 59:10.671

59:10.881 --> 59:12.965

Bye.

59:15.344 --> 59:18.471
This ain't CaIi, girI. They ain't gonna arrest
you for smoking inside.

59:18.680 --> 59:20.640
I had to use the phone.

59:20.849 --> 59:22.642
- Want to go for a waIk?

59:22.851 --> 59:24.227

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.649
Ozzy: So why did it take you
three years to come back?

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.527
God, l've just been
crazy busy, you know?

01:00:14.736 --> 01:00:17.280
lf it's not one thing,
it's something eIse.

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:20.741
Shit, who am I kidding?

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.452
I'm sure
you've heard everything.

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:25.913
You'II catch a break.
You just--

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:27.498
you just got
to hang in there.

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:29.166
Caught a break.

01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:31.877
What if I'm waiting
on something that never happens?

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:33.462
How much more time
shouId I waste?

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:35.631
A year?
Two? 10?

01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:39.593
Stuck in the same pIace whiIe everybody
eIse's Iife is moving forward.

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.387
So what are you gonna do?
Move back?

01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:43.389
Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:45.683
That wouIdn't be
the worst thing, right?

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:50.855
I never thought I'd hear
that coming from you.

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:53.733
I'm 29 years oId

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:56.444
and I'm sick and tired of someone eIse
deciding my fate

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:59.739
when I'm just as good
if not better

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:01.490
than most of the actresses
out there.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.826
- They don't know me.
- You are good.

01:01:04.036 --> 01:01:06.871
Like that time that you pIayed
that homeIess chick in "One Way Ticket."

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.956
- You saw that?
- Are you kidding?

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:11.208
You killed it.
You're Iike the Puerto Rican MeryI Streep.

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:12.752
Yeah, right.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:15.421
Your parents made us watch
the DVD Iike five times.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:17.757
- Of course they did.
- Yeah.

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:23.012
Look, don't teII
anybody what I said.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:26.390
AII right?
I'm aII over the pIace right now.

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:30.061
I'II think about it.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.898
You'II think about it?

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.859
- Don't make me kick your ass.
- You got to catch me.

01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:38.694
- Kick my ass.
- Don't make--

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:41.655
- Kick my ass. What?
- l will kick your ass.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:45.034
Why are you running?
Why are you running?

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.598
We didn't use protection.

01:02:07.808 --> 01:02:11.227
Nope. You said you wanted
to make a baby.

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:13.396
I was compIeteIy Ioaded.

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:15.523
In vino veritas.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.483
Oh, reaIIy?
Oh, reaIIy?

01:02:17.692 --> 01:02:19.944
And I probabIy toId the bartender
he Iooked Iike George CIooney.

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:22.154
Mm-hmm.
Among other things.

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:24.407
What's the date?
What's the date?

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:26.617
What is the date?

01:02:26.827 --> 01:02:28.911
It's Christmas Eve,
December 24th.

01:02:29.121 --> 01:02:32.248
Okay, that pubIic Iibrary
event, l had my period.

01:02:32.457 --> 01:02:34.291
- What are you doing?
- That's 19 days.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.502
Okay, I'm okay.
We're okay.

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:39.797
I think we're okay.
I hope we're okay.

01:02:40.006 --> 01:02:42.550
Mauricio, how couId you take
advantage of me like that?

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.093
l didn't take
advantage of you.

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.137
- You took advantage of me.
- Oh!

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.305
You don't want to make
a baby anymore?

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:50.433

The coIors in this room
are inducing a migraine.

01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:11.120
Does that mean we're not
gonna try again?

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:13.789
Oh, eat me.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:17.626

- You think I don't know?
- Know what?

01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:11.639
That every year your father gets me drunk

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:49.343
Dad, look, l know you're not
happy about me going back.

01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:51.845
Of course I'm not.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.892
Jesse, I'm your father.
I want you safe.

01:04:57.102 --> 01:04:58.894

01:05:00.772 --> 01:05:03.357

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:09.280
You can't.
Just Iike I can't make you stay.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:17.621
There's a point when aII a father can do
is just get out of the way.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.253
Thanks, Dad.

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.722
I'd better give
Tina her check.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.473
Otherwise she's gonna
start the revoIution.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.395
Any word?

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:43.564
No, I'm just texting

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.149

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.401

Don't even worry about it.

01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:21.685

I don't want anything to get in the way
of them having a good time.

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:25.040
