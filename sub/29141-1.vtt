00:27.204 --> 00:29.472
<i>Righto, let's do this.</i>

00:45.489 --> 00:46.588
<i>Right.</i>

00:46.590 --> 00:48.290
<i>You wouldn't believe
the amount of shit</i>

00:48.292 --> 00:49.291
<i>that's about to go down.</i>

00:49.293 --> 00:50.559
<i>We don't have time
to fuck around</i>

00:50.561 --> 00:52.530
<i>so I'm going to make this
really, really simple.</i>

00:55.533 --> 00:57.366
<i>Thousands of years ago,</i>

00:57.368 --> 00:58.534
<i>when the first ancient man</i>

00:58.536 --> 01:01.036
<i>started sacrificing animals
to the gods...</i>

01:01.972 --> 01:05.307
<i>They unwittingly
opened a portal</i>

01:05.309 --> 01:07.478
<i>that brought demons
into this world.</i>

01:08.579 --> 01:10.045
<i>The demons
possessed the humans,</i>

01:10.047 --> 01:12.715
<i>took over their bodies
like parasites</i>

01:12.717 --> 01:15.383
<i>and started doing
unspeakable things.</i>

01:15.385 --> 01:16.785
<i>Dealing out violence and death</i>

01:16.787 --> 01:19.222
<i>devouring souls
with an insatiable appetite.</i>

01:21.391 --> 01:23.291
<i>Things looked grim.</i>

01:23.293 --> 01:26.461
<i>Then came the Nekromancers.</i>

01:26.463 --> 01:28.063
<i>Bad-arse demon hunters</i>

01:28.065 --> 01:29.198
<i>with magic in their veins</i>

01:29.200 --> 01:31.301
<i>and big, fuck-off weapons
in their hands.</i>

01:35.872 --> 01:37.638
<i>They've been
kicking each other's arses now</i>

01:37.640 --> 01:38.942
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

01:44.948 --> 01:46.848
<i>But recently,</i>

01:46.850 --> 01:48.983
<i>some evil son of a bitch
worked out a way</i>

01:48.985 --> 01:51.354
<i>to blast demons
inside the internet.</i>

01:52.689 --> 01:56.624
<i>Now, they can get you
through your phones.</i>

01:56.626 --> 01:57.861
<i>You get all that?</i>

01:58.360 --> 01:59.361
<i>Good.</i>

02:30.025 --> 02:31.059
Rangi!

02:41.637 --> 02:42.938
Stop! Stop!

02:43.705 --> 02:45.005
Turn it off!

02:45.007 --> 02:46.539
Rangi, turn it off!

02:46.541 --> 02:48.309
- Oh, shit!
- Turn it off!

02:52.547 --> 02:53.681
Ohh!

02:58.553 --> 02:59.687
Shit.

03:02.423 --> 03:03.591
Shit!

03:04.092 --> 03:05.593
You said it, bro.

03:20.407 --> 03:21.576
What are you watching?

03:22.543 --> 03:23.776
It's a donkey
trying to have sex

03:23.778 --> 03:25.578
with a phone box.
It's pretty funny.

03:25.580 --> 03:26.779
Why would you watch that?

03:26.781 --> 03:28.749
- Why wouldn't you watch that?
- I don't wanna watch that.

03:32.586 --> 03:34.186
Howard,

03:34.188 --> 03:36.057
what are you doing standing
around in your jocks for?

03:37.158 --> 03:38.556
I'm working on my tan.

03:38.558 --> 03:39.724
You dickheads

03:39.726 --> 03:41.793
are gonna have to take
Dad's shift.

03:41.795 --> 03:43.494
He's hungover again.
He couldn't be bothered.

03:43.496 --> 03:45.164
No, no, no, we've just
come off a 17-hour shift.

03:45.166 --> 03:46.631
We haven't even slept yet.

03:46.633 --> 03:48.468
Mum says you gotta do it.

03:49.703 --> 03:51.502
It's a PFYD.

03:51.504 --> 03:53.037
What's a PFYD?

03:53.039 --> 03:56.875
A problem for you dickheads.

03:56.877 --> 03:57.976
Genius.

03:57.978 --> 03:59.644
This is bullshit!

03:59.646 --> 04:01.946
No, it's human shit, mate.

04:01.948 --> 04:03.516
That's how we pay the rent.

04:05.118 --> 04:07.886
So, I suggest

04:07.888 --> 04:10.957
you two butt monkeys
get in that truck

04:11.892 --> 04:13.059
and start driving.

04:16.228 --> 04:17.428
See you losers later.

04:24.570 --> 04:27.604
Yeah, so you're brother's
kind of a dick, eh?

04:27.606 --> 04:29.142
Foster brother.

04:46.058 --> 04:48.258
<i>Life is one big
party when you're still young</i>

04:48.260 --> 04:51.128
<i>But who's gonna have your back
when it's all done?</i>

04:51.130 --> 04:52.729
<i>It's all good
when you're little</i>

04:52.731 --> 04:53.897
<i>You have pure fun</i>

04:53.899 --> 04:56.166
<i>Can't be a fool son,
what about the long run?</i>

04:56.168 --> 04:57.134
Come on, sing it!

04:57.136 --> 04:59.002
<i>Girl,
you're my angel</i>

04:59.004 --> 05:01.071
<i>You're my darling angel</i>

05:01.073 --> 05:02.440
Shaggy!

05:17.155 --> 05:19.088
Oh shit! I got it! I got it!

05:19.090 --> 05:20.957
Get it! Ah, fuck! Ow! Stop!

05:27.031 --> 05:28.664
That is disgusting!

05:28.666 --> 05:30.700
No, man, it's just nature.

05:34.806 --> 05:37.239
"Do you want to play a game

05:37.241 --> 05:39.210
"that will change your life
forever?"

05:41.712 --> 05:43.714
Oh, okay. Yeah.

05:46.683 --> 05:47.818
Hell, yeah!

05:51.055 --> 05:52.522
<i>Game activated.</i>

06:19.282 --> 06:20.851
Shh.

07:02.858 --> 07:04.692
<i>Scanning for ghosts.</i>

07:07.329 --> 07:09.695
<i>No ghosts detected.</i>

07:09.697 --> 07:11.031
- Hey, Rangi!
- Ah!

07:11.033 --> 07:12.632
What the fuck you doin', man?
Come on.

07:12.634 --> 07:14.301
- Ah, shit!
- Get inside the cab, man.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.570
Stupid.

07:16.071 --> 07:17.904
What are you doing?

07:17.906 --> 07:19.672
I'm looking for ghosts.

07:19.674 --> 07:21.275
You're supposed to be able
to see ghosts with this thing,

07:21.277 --> 07:22.642
but I can't see shit.

07:22.644 --> 07:24.077
Like, dead people ghosts?

07:24.079 --> 07:25.178
Yeah.

07:25.180 --> 07:27.680
It's like that game with
those weird little monsters

07:27.682 --> 07:29.082
you have to collect.

07:29.084 --> 07:30.783
- What?
- You're supposed to find them

07:30.785 --> 07:32.018
and catch them
with your phone.

07:32.020 --> 07:34.754
Cool, man. Why are you always
playing on that thing for?

07:34.756 --> 07:36.722
What else am I supposed to do
on a three-hour road trip?

07:36.724 --> 07:39.258
How about
a conversation? With me?

07:39.260 --> 07:40.426
Verbal communication.

07:40.428 --> 07:42.095
The sharing of information
via the mouth.

07:42.097 --> 07:44.931
- You remember that?
- Ew.

07:44.933 --> 07:47.666
You want to share something
with me via your mouth?

07:47.668 --> 07:49.102
Well, not when you
say it like that, no.

07:49.104 --> 07:51.039
But the conversation
part, yes.

07:52.773 --> 07:53.874
Okay, then.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.077
Let's have a conversation.

07:57.378 --> 07:59.245
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

07:59.247 --> 08:00.848
Uh...

08:03.016 --> 08:04.252
- Mmm-hmm.
- <i>Play.</i>

08:05.353 --> 08:06.452
<i>Ghosts detected.</i>

08:06.454 --> 08:08.220
- Stop the truck!
- Whoa!

08:11.091 --> 08:12.092
Shit!

08:12.826 --> 08:14.128
Oh, shit!

08:16.363 --> 08:18.997
Oh, yeah, baby!

08:18.999 --> 08:20.966
Oh, would you look
at this thing?

08:20.968 --> 08:23.168
- <i>Ghost detected.</i>
- It's a ghost!

08:23.170 --> 08:26.704
The graphics on this thing
are sick. Bro, check this out.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.140
You have got to be
kidding me, man.

08:28.142 --> 08:29.441
I thought we hit a dog
or something!

08:29.443 --> 08:31.276
What is wrong with you?
Fuck it, the phone?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.311
So, how do I catch this thing?

08:33.313 --> 08:34.845
<i>Double tap to capture.</i>

08:34.847 --> 08:35.914
Yep.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.251
Oh, snap! Did you see...

08:40.254 --> 08:43.154
Oh, shit! Dude, you all right?
What happened?

08:43.155 --> 08:45.257
I dunno.
I just had a stabbing pain

08:45.259 --> 08:46.258
in the back of my neck.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.460
- Could be a brain tumor.
- It's not a brain tumor.

08:48.462 --> 08:51.061
- It could...
- Definitely not a brain tumor.

08:51.063 --> 08:54.131
Okay... Oh, dude, take it easy
with the pills, man.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.332
Remember that time
you got wasted

08:55.334 --> 08:56.333
and you took too many?

08:56.335 --> 08:59.003
Started yelling about
space aliens and shit?

08:59.005 --> 09:00.171
Then, you punched my aunty.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.407
That was one time.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.278
What the shit is that?

09:06.045 --> 09:07.280
Uh...

09:08.314 --> 09:10.181
Nekropod.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.814
Ah, I read about these.

09:11.816 --> 09:14.051
They have them
all over the place.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.187
They're like super-duper
transmitter thingies

09:16.189 --> 09:18.122
or something.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.191
That's why the graphics
are so sweet.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.258
Wait, that thing's a part

09:21.260 --> 09:22.461
of your shitty,
little phone game?

09:23.828 --> 09:24.827
That reminds me.

09:24.829 --> 09:27.264
There should be a wraith,
up there somewhere.

09:27.266 --> 09:28.301
Oh, dude...

09:29.267 --> 09:30.967
Dude!

09:32.837 --> 09:34.407
Check that shit out.

09:39.878 --> 09:41.746
That thing's
freaking me out, man.

09:42.981 --> 09:44.216
Yeah, it's crazy, huh?

09:47.352 --> 09:48.954
Come on,
let's get out of here.

10:04.369 --> 10:05.869
Ah!

10:06.904 --> 10:08.473
Good afternoon, ma'am.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.440
How are you?

10:10.442 --> 10:12.874
<i>Ginsberg.</i>

10:12.876 --> 10:15.413
<i>You're not wearing
your Santa hat.</i>

10:27.258 --> 10:28.991
<i>Much better.</i>

10:28.993 --> 10:30.492
<i>Now...</i>

10:30.494 --> 10:33.061
<i>Nekropods. Update.</i>

10:33.063 --> 10:34.563
Yeah, the Nekropods, yes.

10:34.565 --> 10:37.399
The new battery units
you have supplied

10:37.401 --> 10:38.835
are being installed.

10:41.472 --> 10:43.538
After the launch
of the game last week,

10:43.540 --> 10:45.873
<i>we estimate
the amount of devices</i>

10:45.875 --> 10:47.875
<i>that have uploaded
the application</i>

10:47.877 --> 10:49.213
to be...

10:51.315 --> 10:53.116
<i>1.3 million.</i>

11:03.059 --> 11:04.994
<i>Excuse me for a second.</i>

11:25.248 --> 11:26.815
I, ah...

11:27.617 --> 11:29.350
<i>If anything goes wrong,</i>

11:29.352 --> 11:32.187
<i>I kill every single person
in that room.</i>

11:52.441 --> 11:54.042
Start the engine.

12:24.673 --> 12:27.707
Nekromancers going
offline all over the city.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.041
Couldn't find anybody
out there.

12:29.043 --> 12:30.211
They're either blocked

12:30.978 --> 12:32.113
or they're dead.

12:32.714 --> 12:33.981
It's Finnegan.

12:36.417 --> 12:37.952
<i>Offline.</i>

12:38.986 --> 12:41.389
Right, so she's finally
made a move.

12:45.292 --> 12:48.527
- Oh, man!
- <i>Ghost.</i>

12:48.529 --> 12:51.663
Dude, there's fricking ghosts
everywhere.

12:51.665 --> 12:54.600
Come on, pull over.
Let me get my score up.

12:54.602 --> 12:56.235
No, I am not stopping
this truck again

12:56.237 --> 12:58.437
so you can play
fricking video games, man!

12:58.439 --> 13:00.339
Pull your head
out of your arse!

13:00.341 --> 13:02.340
Pull your
head out of your arse.

13:02.342 --> 13:03.742
Get your head
out of your... Oh, shit!

13:08.014 --> 13:09.147
<i>Entity unknown.</i>

13:09.149 --> 13:10.749
Whoa!

13:10.751 --> 13:12.450
Dude, what the fuck!

13:12.452 --> 13:14.318
What the hell
is wrong with you?

13:14.320 --> 13:16.156
Dude, what's wrong with you?

13:18.258 --> 13:19.991
You've got all this

13:19.993 --> 13:22.527
weird, freaky shit
going on, man.

13:22.529 --> 13:25.263
- <i>Entity unknown.</i>
- Whoa!

13:25.265 --> 13:28.533
Hey, you're not a ghost
though, are you, bro?

13:28.535 --> 13:31.369
Like, you would tell me
if you were a ghost, right?

13:31.371 --> 13:32.603
I'm about to turn you
into a ghost,

13:32.605 --> 13:33.606
you fucking cock-knocker!

13:34.541 --> 13:36.139
I nearly
crashed the truck, Rangi!

13:36.141 --> 13:37.608
What the fuck
is wrong with you, man?

13:37.610 --> 13:38.977
You scared the shit out of me!

13:40.413 --> 13:42.279
What are you doing?
What are you doing now?

13:42.281 --> 13:44.347
- <i>Double tap to play.</i>
- I'm just gonna try something.

13:44.349 --> 13:46.185
Rangi, listen, you've gotta
stop this shit, all right?

13:57.629 --> 13:59.631
<i>Unknown. Unknown.</i>

14:00.466 --> 14:02.367
<i>Unknown. Unknown.</i>

14:12.444 --> 14:14.177
What is that?

14:14.179 --> 14:16.145
The signal's off the charts.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.382
Who the hell is that?

14:18.383 --> 14:21.118
Oh, it can't be.
It can't be possible.

14:22.454 --> 14:26.456
Oh, fuck! Dude,
what the fuck happened to you?

14:26.458 --> 14:27.757
What'd you do to me?

14:27.759 --> 14:29.793
I was just messing around
on my phone, and then

14:29.795 --> 14:32.328
fuckin' shit gone mental, bro!

14:32.330 --> 14:34.332
What the hell?
What happened?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.702
Howie!

14:38.704 --> 14:42.671
You got blood
comin' out of your ears, bro.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.510
Can't be good for you, bro!

14:48.646 --> 14:51.649
Let's get you to a hospital.
Howie!

14:57.688 --> 14:59.555
What the fuck's your problem?

14:59.557 --> 15:01.191
I'm trying to help you, man!

15:10.200 --> 15:12.835
Oh, you've gotta be
kidding me.

15:17.207 --> 15:21.177
Rip... Tear... Kill... Eat.

15:43.132 --> 15:44.732
Tell me you're seeing this.

15:44.734 --> 15:46.436
Yeah, I'm seeing this, bro.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.308
No! Get back!

16:01.918 --> 16:03.617
No, no, no! Don't do it!

16:03.619 --> 16:04.854
Oh!

16:14.930 --> 16:16.530
Fuck!

16:16.532 --> 16:17.533
Fuck it!

16:18.267 --> 16:19.568
Run! Run!

16:23.572 --> 16:25.474
Don't! No, no, no!

16:39.487 --> 16:41.322
Do it!

16:48.763 --> 16:51.165
Oh, shit.
It's my bad, bro!

17:24.832 --> 17:26.400
It's him.

17:33.908 --> 17:36.343
Dude! Yo, dude!

17:38.679 --> 17:39.880
Howard, come on, buddy.

17:41.748 --> 17:43.281
Come on, buddy.

17:43.283 --> 17:44.284
<i>Howie!</i>

17:44.851 --> 17:46.186
<i>Howie!</i>

17:56.295 --> 17:57.597
Check that out.

17:59.432 --> 18:01.735
Wow. That's old tech, huh?

18:02.803 --> 18:05.302
Certainly is.

18:05.304 --> 18:07.673
That thing's been inside him
longer than you've been alive.

18:09.042 --> 18:10.607
Right.

18:10.609 --> 18:11.744
Put the new one in.

18:14.948 --> 18:17.815
Ahh! Oh, fuck!

18:17.817 --> 18:19.552
What the fuck
did you just put into me?

18:21.687 --> 18:23.821
What the hell is going on?
Huh?

18:23.823 --> 18:24.957
Who are you people?

18:25.691 --> 18:27.426
Well, my name's Luther.

18:28.527 --> 18:30.461
These are my daughters.

18:30.463 --> 18:33.864
This is Torquel and Molly.

18:33.866 --> 18:35.432
Now, as to
your previous question,

18:35.434 --> 18:37.268
it's called a scrambler.
It's a new version.

18:38.369 --> 18:39.770
With that safely inserted
in your head,

18:39.772 --> 18:41.640
hopefully they won't be able
to find you.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.307
What?

18:44.309 --> 18:46.009
You got some pretty
weird friends, bro.

18:46.011 --> 18:47.545
Ahh!

18:48.513 --> 18:49.581
What'd you do that for?

18:50.582 --> 18:51.815
Take a seat.

18:51.817 --> 18:53.583
No, I don't want
to take a seat.

18:53.585 --> 18:54.887
Please, sit down.

19:10.568 --> 19:12.771
Howard, you're a Nekromancer.

19:13.638 --> 19:15.707
You're a demon hunter,
like us.

19:18.409 --> 19:19.675
Come again.

19:19.677 --> 19:22.044
You're one of
the last surviving members

19:22.046 --> 19:24.513
of the most
powerful bloodlines

19:24.515 --> 19:26.483
our kind has ever known.

19:27.719 --> 19:30.485
You know, back in the day,
your mother and father...

19:30.487 --> 19:32.389
Wait a minute.
Sorry, hang on, wait a minute.

19:33.657 --> 19:35.894
So, you know my parents?
My actual parents?

19:37.427 --> 19:39.063
I knew your parents.

19:45.702 --> 19:47.971
Henry and Finnegan.

19:50.707 --> 19:52.140
Your mother, she came

19:52.142 --> 19:55.610
from one of the great European
Nekromancer dynasties.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.145
Tremendously powerful family.

19:57.147 --> 19:59.014
And she could
perform exorcisms

19:59.016 --> 20:00.984
with her bare hands.

20:05.756 --> 20:06.988
<i>With your father,</i>

20:06.990 --> 20:09.456
<i>she killed
thousands of demons.</i>

20:09.458 --> 20:10.859
<i>And they were
the first ones to discover</i>

20:10.861 --> 20:13.527
<i>demon activity online.</i>

20:13.529 --> 20:15.429
<i>The old bastards
were all through the web</i>

20:15.431 --> 20:18.001
<i>like a virus, corrupting souls
faster than ever.</i>

20:19.002 --> 20:22.103
<i>But Henry and Finnegan
devised a way</i>

20:22.105 --> 20:24.340
<i>to blast their souls
inside the internet.</i>

20:26.709 --> 20:28.576
That way, we could track

20:28.578 --> 20:30.947
and exterminate the swine
faster than ever.

20:32.548 --> 20:35.051
<i>But Finnegan
spent too much time online.</i>

20:40.022 --> 20:41.891
<i>And the demons got to her.</i>

20:44.093 --> 20:45.862
<i>Corrupted her completely.</i>

20:51.667 --> 20:54.467
<i>She became a soul eater,
feeding on her own people</i>

20:54.469 --> 20:56.837
<i>like a crack addict from hell.</i>

20:56.839 --> 20:59.672
<i>Each soul she ate brought her
closer to immortality</i>

20:59.674 --> 21:00.842
<i>and ultimate power.</i>

21:01.810 --> 21:03.445
She even went after you.

21:05.614 --> 21:06.980
But your father
got there first.

21:06.982 --> 21:08.748
<i>He scooped you up.</i>

21:08.750 --> 21:10.817
He tried to hide you
where she wouldn't find you

21:10.819 --> 21:12.520
and by the time
we caught up with him,

21:13.121 --> 21:15.088
he was dead.

21:15.090 --> 21:17.724
Murdered by wraiths.

21:17.726 --> 21:20.493
Well, we assumed
you were dead, too.

21:20.495 --> 21:22.495
What happened to my mother?

21:22.497 --> 21:24.132
She's still around.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.502
Your mother was the one
that sent that axe maniac

21:30.504 --> 21:31.838
to chop your head off.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.975
<i>She's been killing all
the Nekromancers in the city.</i>

21:35.844 --> 21:38.144
<i>Taking their heads.</i>

21:38.146 --> 21:41.515
Every single person
we know... Dead.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.489
And your father made this.

21:50.491 --> 21:52.524
I believe Henry
put this scrambler in you

21:52.526 --> 21:53.694
to keep you safe.

21:54.828 --> 21:56.563
But you came home
today, Howard.

21:57.698 --> 21:59.097
You came home

21:59.099 --> 22:01.166
the very day
that she comes out of hiding

22:01.168 --> 22:04.236
and kills every able-bodied
Nekromancer in the city,

22:04.238 --> 22:05.973
except for us, and you.

22:06.874 --> 22:08.208
You're here

22:09.777 --> 22:11.979
for a reason, Howard.

22:22.923 --> 22:24.588
What the fuck are you doing?

22:24.590 --> 22:25.756
I'm just updating my status.

22:25.758 --> 22:27.225
Tell me you don't have
the game on this.

22:27.227 --> 22:28.826
- I don't.
- You do.

22:28.828 --> 22:30.828
- Yeah I do but...
- You motherfucker!

22:30.830 --> 22:32.297
That's my fricking phone!

22:32.299 --> 22:33.731
They're in the building.

22:33.733 --> 22:35.868
We have to get out
of here. Now.

22:58.992 --> 23:01.794
No, don't. Rangi. Rangi!

23:04.197 --> 23:05.898
Rangi!

23:17.976 --> 23:19.745
What the fuck was that?

23:40.966 --> 23:43.133
Get him out of here.
I'll hold them off.

23:43.135 --> 23:44.300
Not a chance.

23:49.673 --> 23:51.076
Go! Now!

23:53.245 --> 23:54.377
Get up!

23:54.379 --> 23:55.613
Get up!

24:03.821 --> 24:06.824
Come on, Howard.

24:26.077 --> 24:27.812
Tor, we have to move.

24:42.826 --> 24:44.326
- Hi, Luther.
- Oh!

24:44.328 --> 24:47.063
Finnegan. Long time no see.

24:48.765 --> 24:52.100
Where is he?

24:52.102 --> 24:53.703
Oh, he'll find you.

24:54.404 --> 24:55.939
Good.

24:57.207 --> 24:58.241
Hey, Luther.

24:59.242 --> 25:00.343
Merry Christmas.

25:04.013 --> 25:04.948
Hey!

25:12.255 --> 25:13.921
Get in.

25:13.923 --> 25:15.423
They were dead already,
Howard.

25:15.425 --> 25:17.327
Come on. We gotta go.

25:19.728 --> 25:21.930
Hey! Get in the van.

25:23.399 --> 25:26.402
Howard, get in the van. Now.

25:28.438 --> 25:29.738
Shit!

25:30.906 --> 25:32.241
Howard! Stop!

25:52.961 --> 25:55.164
Hey, bro.

26:11.413 --> 26:14.148
So, I think I'm a ghost now.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.784
It's not too bad, actually.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.753
I can teleport
into the shadows and stuff,

26:20.755 --> 26:24.325
and I can stretch my face
like a mofo. Check this out.

26:28.262 --> 26:31.363
- Yeah, pretty disgusting, huh?
- Very.

26:31.365 --> 26:33.199
So I went for a cruise
around before.

26:33.201 --> 26:35.868
There's, like,
ghosts everywhere.

26:35.870 --> 26:38.206
But they're, like, retarded
or something.

26:39.173 --> 26:41.207
But I'm different.

26:41.209 --> 26:43.743
I think that's because
you did something to me.

26:44.345 --> 26:46.545
See, wherever I go,

26:46.547 --> 26:48.848
I keep getting
pulled back here to you.

26:51.519 --> 26:54.118
- Why is that?
- I don't... I don't know.

27:04.931 --> 27:06.299
You okay, Mr. North?

27:08.101 --> 27:10.068
My dead friend
just flew down off the ceiling

27:10.070 --> 27:11.204
and ripped his face off.

27:12.539 --> 27:14.140
No, I'm not okay.

27:16.276 --> 27:18.378
Are you seeing this? Hmm?

27:19.579 --> 27:21.114
Seeing what?

27:21.982 --> 27:24.315
Dude, he can't see shit.

27:24.317 --> 27:26.084
I'm a fricking ghost.

27:26.086 --> 27:28.253
Hey, what the hell happened
to all the hot nurses?

27:28.255 --> 27:30.490
This guy looks like someone
slapped some hair on a penis.

27:34.994 --> 27:36.226
You didn't hear that?

27:36.228 --> 27:37.828
Hear what?

27:37.830 --> 27:40.032
The thing about the penis.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.901
I'll get the doctor.

27:52.111 --> 27:53.445
Watch this.

27:58.450 --> 27:59.950
What is that?

27:59.952 --> 28:03.453
This is a hallucination
brought on by stress.

28:03.455 --> 28:04.521
I'm a hallucination now, am I?

28:04.523 --> 28:05.955
Yes, correct. Yes, you are.

28:05.957 --> 28:08.225
- Can a hallucination do this?
- No, no!

28:08.227 --> 28:10.227
What?

28:10.229 --> 28:11.528
Now, they're gonna think
I did that.

28:11.530 --> 28:14.030
- So?
- Can you just please

28:14.032 --> 28:16.500
go and haunt somebody else?
I am not feeling very good.

28:16.502 --> 28:19.569
How do you think I'm feeling?
I'm dead.

28:19.571 --> 28:21.904
And I gotta hang out
with your boring ass.

28:21.906 --> 28:23.339
I don't even have my phone.

28:23.341 --> 28:24.373
It's your goddamn phone

28:24.375 --> 28:26.342
that got us into this mess
in the first place!

28:26.344 --> 28:27.577
What the fuck am I doing?

28:27.579 --> 28:29.545
I'm arguing with a figment
of my imagination.

28:29.547 --> 28:31.113
Hey, who are you calling
a figment, you...

28:36.254 --> 28:37.588
Something's coming.

29:26.936 --> 29:29.437
"Howard North.

29:29.439 --> 29:34.676
"Driver's license
registered to Plumpton."

29:34.678 --> 29:38.011
That place is a dump.

29:38.013 --> 29:40.247
You're telling me.
Are you sure you're my doctor?

29:40.249 --> 29:42.486
You're on anti-psychotics.

29:43.587 --> 29:45.687
Crazy pills.

29:45.689 --> 29:48.222
How long
have you been on those for?

29:48.224 --> 29:50.625
- Since I was a kid.
- Why?

29:50.627 --> 29:53.229
I have a tendency
to put people in hospitals.

29:56.632 --> 30:00.636
And sometimes, I, uh,
see shit that isn't there.

30:01.971 --> 30:03.939
Who said it isn't there?

30:05.207 --> 30:08.142
You look like your father.

30:08.144 --> 30:10.613
Sounds like you got
my temperament.

30:11.614 --> 30:14.181
That's interesting.

30:14.183 --> 30:16.983
You've gone white as a ghost.

30:16.985 --> 30:18.119
How's your temperature?

30:23.325 --> 30:24.926
You're my mother.

30:27.328 --> 30:30.029
Nice to meet you, <i>mon amour.</i>

30:30.031 --> 30:31.598
The same one
that killed all those people

30:31.600 --> 30:33.634
and sucked out their souls,

30:33.636 --> 30:36.202
then abandoned me as a child
and murdered my father?

30:36.204 --> 30:38.204
That mother?

30:38.206 --> 30:41.140
Well, I mean, sure,
I did some of that shit.

30:41.142 --> 30:44.145
But that was
a dark time for me.

30:45.246 --> 30:46.614
But I'll tell you one thing.

30:47.515 --> 30:49.348
I never,

30:49.350 --> 30:52.220
and I mean never,
abandoned you.

30:54.489 --> 30:55.655
Did you send someone out

30:55.657 --> 30:57.625
to chop my head off
with an axe?

31:01.429 --> 31:03.161
Okay.

31:03.163 --> 31:06.566
Okay! I'll cop to that.

31:06.568 --> 31:10.202
But I had no idea
that was you at the time.

31:10.204 --> 31:13.104
What kind of a monster
do you think I am?

31:18.713 --> 31:20.212
Those aren't going
to help you.

31:20.214 --> 31:22.214
How would you know?

31:22.216 --> 31:25.350
How the fuck would you know?
You're a murdering psychopath.

31:26.453 --> 31:28.186
You've been talking
to the wrong people.

31:28.188 --> 31:30.288
Those Nekromancers
are full of shit.

31:30.290 --> 31:31.692
Yeah, well, I think
you're full of shit.

31:42.402 --> 31:43.737
Take my hand.

31:47.608 --> 31:48.709
Do it.

31:49.409 --> 31:50.544
Come on.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.326
Do you feel that?

32:08.261 --> 32:10.494
That's more power

32:10.496 --> 32:13.599
than you've ever conceived
in your small lifetime.

32:15.401 --> 32:19.405
And it's not even
the tip of the iceberg.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.741
Howard, I am your mother,

32:23.743 --> 32:25.676
and I've missed you,

32:25.678 --> 32:28.581
and I love you very much.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.187
And what I'm offering

32:37.255 --> 32:40.292
is a lot more fun.

32:49.701 --> 32:53.136
There is a scrambler unit
in the back of your head.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.173
I want you to take that cable

32:56.875 --> 32:58.376
and plug it in.

32:58.910 --> 33:00.610
Then what happens?

33:00.612 --> 33:03.146
Then the pain goes away

33:03.148 --> 33:06.749
and everything
becomes peaches and cream,

33:06.751 --> 33:10.787
and fun, fun, fun, forever.

33:16.226 --> 33:18.393
Uh, is there a soul
in that box?

33:18.395 --> 33:20.162
Don't be a pussy, Howard!

33:20.164 --> 33:22.431
Just plug in
the fucking cable!

33:40.784 --> 33:43.454
You're either coming with us,
or you're going with her.

33:44.488 --> 33:46.223
I'll come with you.

34:14.885 --> 34:17.885
This is all actually
happening, isn't it?

34:17.887 --> 34:20.955
Yeah, this is
actually happening.

34:20.956 --> 34:23.391
My mother just tried
to force-feed me a soul

34:23.393 --> 34:24.893
through a hole
in the back of my head.

34:26.262 --> 34:27.496
Really?

34:28.297 --> 34:29.830
Well, I'm glad she didn't.

34:29.831 --> 34:31.831
If she did, we'd have to
force-feed a bullet

34:31.833 --> 34:33.703
through a hole
in the front of your head.

34:42.978 --> 34:45.246
I'm seeing a lot
of dead people right now.

34:45.915 --> 34:47.614
Don't worry.

34:47.616 --> 34:49.384
You get used
to the freaky shit.

34:55.824 --> 34:57.891
- Are we safe up here?
- Yeah, don't worry.

34:57.893 --> 34:59.893
It's a safe zone. We've got
scramblers all over the place.

35:02.998 --> 35:04.864
Wraith.

35:04.866 --> 35:07.500
What? No fucking way. Where?

35:07.502 --> 35:09.602
- Molly, where is it?
- It's there!

35:09.604 --> 35:11.304
- It's over there.
- Wait, wait, wait!

35:11.306 --> 35:12.372
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Hey, hey!

35:12.374 --> 35:13.440
What the hell are you doing?

35:13.442 --> 35:15.307
That is my friend!
That's my friend.

35:15.309 --> 35:17.844
Look, I come in peace, okay?
So, don't blast me.

35:17.846 --> 35:20.013
Great. You bring your phone
this time, dickhead?

35:20.015 --> 35:21.548
- No.
- Good.

35:21.550 --> 35:22.782
Well, well, well.

35:22.784 --> 35:25.384
Looks like Howard here's
made himself a wraith.

35:25.386 --> 35:28.021
I'm a wraith?
I thought I was a ghost.

35:28.023 --> 35:29.388
What's the difference?

35:29.390 --> 35:30.992
You're like a ghost
on steroids.

35:32.027 --> 35:34.293
What is that?

35:34.295 --> 35:36.263
That's why we're here.
Come on.

35:45.840 --> 35:49.308
They're ghosts being sucked
into Nekropods.

35:49.310 --> 35:52.478
And all that energy
is pouring into the network,

35:52.480 --> 35:54.949
directly into the hands
of you-know-who.

35:56.083 --> 35:58.951
- Who?
- Your mother, Finnegan.

35:58.953 --> 36:00.318
Who do you think?

36:00.320 --> 36:01.854
Well, how am I
supposed to know?

36:01.856 --> 36:02.890
Okay.

36:03.958 --> 36:05.425
Check this out.

36:07.527 --> 36:09.527
This is a map of the city.

36:09.529 --> 36:11.964
The Nekropods are forming
a giant pentagram.

36:11.966 --> 36:14.034
A pentagram
is a summoning symbol.

36:17.504 --> 36:20.505
Shit. Sorry.
It's kind of addictive.

36:20.507 --> 36:22.406
- Come on, man.
- Okay.

36:22.408 --> 36:23.710
Put this on.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.079
All right, straight ahead.

36:27.081 --> 36:29.747
At the foot of that building,
about halfway up the wall.

36:29.749 --> 36:30.884
Do you see it?

36:33.453 --> 36:34.988
Ah, Nekropod, yeah.

36:38.458 --> 36:40.691
Look we're going to get
that Nekropod, open it up,

36:40.693 --> 36:41.928
find out
what's under the hood.

36:42.562 --> 36:43.563
Wanna come with?

36:45.899 --> 36:47.698
- Um...
- "Um" is not an answer.

36:47.700 --> 36:48.866
Just give me a minute, please.

36:48.868 --> 36:50.668
Okay, we don't have a minute,
hotshot. Just listen...

36:50.670 --> 36:52.538
No, you listen. You listen.

36:53.539 --> 36:54.972
I just found out
that I'm part of

36:54.974 --> 36:57.975
some weird, little,
anti-satanic superhero club.

36:57.977 --> 37:00.011
And that my mother
killed my father

37:00.013 --> 37:01.411
and a whole lot
of other people

37:01.413 --> 37:03.446
and ate their fuckin' souls!

37:03.448 --> 37:05.448
And because of that,
I've spent my entire life

37:05.450 --> 37:06.783
growing up
in shitty foster homes

37:06.785 --> 37:07.884
thinking I was Oliver Twist,

37:07.886 --> 37:10.823
but, apparently, I'm Merlin
the fuckin' Magician.

37:11.990 --> 37:14.591
Demons are trying to kill me

37:14.593 --> 37:17.961
through phones, with axes.

37:17.963 --> 37:19.129
Somebody tried to suck my soul

37:19.131 --> 37:20.530
directly through
my face today.

37:20.532 --> 37:21.932
And now, you're asking me

37:21.934 --> 37:25.035
to help you steal a thing
off a wall that is guarded by,

37:25.037 --> 37:27.003
arguably,
the scariest fucking thing

37:27.005 --> 37:28.738
I have ever seen
in my entire life.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.674
Well, excuse me

37:30.676 --> 37:33.542
if I need a little time.
Just give me a fuckin' minute.

37:33.544 --> 37:34.978
Ooh!

37:34.980 --> 37:36.547
You should give him a minute.

37:36.915 --> 37:38.148
Sure.

37:38.150 --> 37:39.617
I'll give you a minute.

37:42.087 --> 37:43.786
Why don't I give you
the same minute

37:43.788 --> 37:46.058
it took for our father
to die for your arse?

37:49.794 --> 37:51.562
Tor, be cool.

38:00.671 --> 38:04.607
Running is not an option.

38:04.609 --> 38:06.108
Not for any of us.

38:06.110 --> 38:08.010
She is going to find us,

38:08.012 --> 38:09.881
and she is going to kill us.

38:11.514 --> 38:14.151
Howard, our Dad said
you were here for a reason.

38:18.455 --> 38:19.924
Give me one day.

38:20.724 --> 38:22.093
Let me train you.

38:23.027 --> 38:24.826
See what you got.

38:24.828 --> 38:26.964
Besides, you got
anything better to do?

38:30.001 --> 38:31.434
Come on.

39:11.274 --> 39:13.174
Whoa!

39:13.176 --> 39:14.977
They've got their own batcave!

39:15.678 --> 39:17.644
This is a Killstation.

39:17.646 --> 39:19.515
It's like a slaughterhouse
for demons.

39:20.749 --> 39:21.815
Don't be scared Howard.

39:21.817 --> 39:22.885
This is a safe zone.

39:30.192 --> 39:31.827
Meet your new
sparring partner.

39:38.133 --> 39:41.168
I saw you push a demon
through a landline cable

39:41.170 --> 39:42.803
with your bare hands today

39:42.805 --> 39:44.539
so I bet you pack
a hell of a punch.

39:46.075 --> 39:47.540
Like, hit it? Like, uh...

39:47.542 --> 39:48.911
No, not with
your hands, Howard.

40:03.992 --> 40:05.493
Like that.

40:06.328 --> 40:07.829
Uh...

40:13.101 --> 40:14.969
Right? Hmm.

40:19.573 --> 40:20.673
I don't know what to do.

40:20.675 --> 40:21.741
You have
to take this seriously.

40:21.743 --> 40:22.910
I am. I just...

40:34.322 --> 40:36.322
I can't!
I'm gonna shit my pants.

40:36.324 --> 40:37.691
I'm gonna shit my pants.

40:38.692 --> 40:40.527
Let's try something smaller.

40:44.631 --> 40:45.964
Close your eyes.

40:45.966 --> 40:47.234
Just relax.

40:49.136 --> 40:50.835
Slow and steady.

41:12.259 --> 41:13.759
Do you feel that?

41:17.030 --> 41:18.265
Yeah, I do.

41:29.708 --> 41:30.776
That's right.

41:31.977 --> 41:33.145
Just like that.

41:38.184 --> 41:39.618
Yes.

41:45.891 --> 41:48.160
Open your eyes.

41:51.197 --> 41:52.697
Hit the bag.

42:15.854 --> 42:17.789
Shit!

42:24.162 --> 42:25.196
I'll get you another one.

42:34.272 --> 42:35.770
This is a Nekroportal.

42:35.772 --> 42:37.739
You push a demon spirit
into this thing

42:37.741 --> 42:39.841
and summon it up
as a real-life demon

42:39.843 --> 42:41.310
through that goopy,
liquid stuff.

42:41.312 --> 42:43.146
Like a 3D printer
for demons, hmm?

42:43.148 --> 42:44.779
Something like that.

42:44.781 --> 42:45.847
And whatever you do,

42:45.849 --> 42:47.316
don't put a naked flame
anywhere near that thing.

42:47.318 --> 42:49.853
- Why?
- It goes boom.

42:52.357 --> 42:56.324
Whoa!
Superhero battle armor!

42:56.326 --> 42:58.226
Fricking sick!

42:58.228 --> 43:00.829
These are
anti-possession suits.

43:00.831 --> 43:02.097
Anytime
you're inside a pentagram

43:02.099 --> 43:03.165
with an active demon,

43:03.167 --> 43:04.399
you must be wearing one

43:04.401 --> 43:05.467
or that thing is gonna try

43:05.469 --> 43:06.768
and jump straight inside
your head,

43:06.770 --> 43:07.936
and if it gets in too deep,

43:07.938 --> 43:09.672
then we're gonna have to,
you know...

43:11.308 --> 43:13.377
- Kill you.
- Great.

43:25.088 --> 43:26.089
Whoa.

43:29.526 --> 43:32.227
There's a demon inside
each one of these things.

43:32.229 --> 43:34.195
We call them trap boxes.

43:34.197 --> 43:35.397
<i>We push the demon</i>

43:35.399 --> 43:38.799
<i>out of the human host
and seal them inside.</i>

43:41.070 --> 43:42.836
This one here

43:42.838 --> 43:44.941
is a nasty, little fucker.

43:59.989 --> 44:01.121
So what you gotta do

44:01.123 --> 44:03.324
is push the demon
out of the trap box

44:03.326 --> 44:06.126
through those cables,
down into the portal.

44:06.128 --> 44:07.794
Then, when you see that thing

44:07.796 --> 44:09.096
light up
like a Christmas tree,

44:09.098 --> 44:10.333
you summon it up.

44:13.336 --> 44:16.337
Just summon it up,
just like that, huh?

44:16.339 --> 44:18.539
Yeah. You'll know what to do.

44:18.541 --> 44:20.242
- All right. Okay.
- Trust me.

44:21.209 --> 44:22.342
Hmm.

44:22.344 --> 44:24.377
Uh, and then what do we do?

44:24.379 --> 44:26.946
Then Old Betsi
takes care of the rest.

44:26.948 --> 44:28.116
Who's Old Betsi?

44:31.052 --> 44:33.488
This is Old Betsi.

44:46.134 --> 44:47.768
Whenever you're ready.

44:53.107 --> 44:56.376
So, I just push the thing

44:56.378 --> 44:58.076
down into the portal,

44:58.078 --> 45:00.346
then it's, uh,
Christmas lights,

45:00.348 --> 45:02.981
then summon, right?

45:02.983 --> 45:04.885
That's right, stud.
We'll take it from there.

45:06.854 --> 45:08.022
Ow! Fuck it!

45:08.590 --> 45:11.256
Oh, Jesus!

45:11.258 --> 45:13.392
Hey! Breathe.

45:13.394 --> 45:15.329
Just relax. Let it happen.

45:16.497 --> 45:19.466
Yeah, okay. All right.

45:21.101 --> 45:23.803
I got this.
I got this.

46:18.023 --> 46:20.156
<i>Demon 786, offline.</i>

46:20.158 --> 46:21.627
Little bastard.

46:23.629 --> 46:25.429
- Hey, Lurch.
- Hmm.

46:25.431 --> 46:28.333
- Get your crew ready.
- Yes, madam.

46:33.438 --> 46:34.705
Okay, here's the plan.

46:34.707 --> 46:36.005
There's an electrical
tunnel system

46:36.007 --> 46:36.940
below the city

46:36.942 --> 46:38.575
that leads directly
to an isolated pod.

46:38.577 --> 46:40.710
We're gonna load up
the plasma guns.

46:42.314 --> 46:43.480
Do I get a plasma gun?

46:43.482 --> 46:46.249
You're a wraith, douchebag.
How're you gonna hold one?

46:46.251 --> 46:47.450
I don't know,
I thought you guys'd have

46:47.452 --> 46:48.952
a ghost gun or something,
you know?

46:48.954 --> 46:50.120
- Where was I?
- Plasma guns.

46:50.122 --> 46:51.156
Right.
We're gonna load 'em up.

46:52.290 --> 46:53.356
We're gonna make our way

46:53.358 --> 46:54.557
through the tunnels
quick smart.

46:54.559 --> 46:55.592
<i>There's an access point</i>

46:55.594 --> 46:59.429
about 15 meters from
the Nekropod, right there.

46:59.431 --> 47:01.466
Torquel goes out first.
She takes out the wraith.

47:04.569 --> 47:05.635
Shouldn't I now take out
the wraith?

47:05.637 --> 47:06.969
You're not ready for that yet.

47:06.971 --> 47:08.303
I could lead her off
on a goose chase

47:08.305 --> 47:10.072
- while you guys do your thing.
- A goose chase?

47:10.074 --> 47:11.674
Hey, no one's doing
any goose chasing.

47:11.676 --> 47:13.275
Torquel's gonna
blast the wraith and then,

47:13.277 --> 47:15.279
right after that, I need you
to detonate the thumper.

47:16.480 --> 47:18.013
Wait a minute.

47:18.015 --> 47:19.148
What's a thumper?

47:19.150 --> 47:21.183
An EMP bomb. Shuts down
all the phones in the area.

47:21.185 --> 47:23.018
Means your darling Mummy
can't send any demons.

47:23.020 --> 47:24.453
- It'll buy us some time.
- Cool.

47:25.589 --> 47:27.356
Then I go and get the pod,

47:27.358 --> 47:28.457
<i>we both jump back
in the tunnels,</i>

47:28.459 --> 47:29.525
<i>and we run like hell.</i>

47:29.527 --> 47:30.626
Any questions?

47:30.628 --> 47:32.161
Yeah. What do I do?

47:32.163 --> 47:34.630
You do fuck all.
Just try and stay out of the way,

47:34.632 --> 47:37.101
But if you see any geese,
chase 'em.

47:55.553 --> 47:57.287
- There it is.
- Right.

47:58.455 --> 47:59.589
Give me the thumper.

48:00.190 --> 48:01.191
Oh. Uh...

48:04.561 --> 48:06.461
That's armed.

48:06.463 --> 48:09.063
When this thing kicks,
it fricking kicks.

48:09.065 --> 48:10.099
So be ready.

48:11.768 --> 48:13.136
Hold this.

48:14.671 --> 48:16.604
That's the detonator.

48:16.606 --> 48:19.373
Do not push that button
until I give you the signal.

48:19.375 --> 48:20.743
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

48:25.113 --> 48:27.216
What is the signal?

48:30.420 --> 48:31.421
Right.

48:32.589 --> 48:33.821
You okay?

48:33.823 --> 48:36.724
I'm holding an EMP detonator
in my hand. No, I'm not okay.

48:36.726 --> 48:39.493
All right. What do you want,
some reassurance?

48:39.495 --> 48:41.696
What I want is for you
to look me in the face

48:41.698 --> 48:43.396
and tell me everything's
going to be super sweet.

48:43.398 --> 48:45.033
That's what I want.
That's what I would like.

48:47.102 --> 48:48.570
Everything's gonna be sweet.

48:50.405 --> 48:51.540
Super sweet?

48:52.274 --> 48:53.542
Super sweet.

48:54.476 --> 48:57.210
Hey! Loverboy!

48:57.212 --> 48:59.781
We only have one shot at this,
so don't fuck it up.

49:00.249 --> 49:01.381
Okay.

49:01.383 --> 49:02.751
I'll see you on the flipside.

49:06.688 --> 49:09.456
Don't miss, bitch.

49:09.458 --> 49:10.726
As if.

49:14.161 --> 49:17.131
You heard the man.
Don't fuck it up.

49:18.432 --> 49:19.701
Thank you.

49:25.573 --> 49:27.774
Oh, shit.

49:45.826 --> 49:48.227
What the fuck did you do?

49:48.229 --> 49:49.662
Oh, shit! Sorry, bro.

49:49.664 --> 49:50.796
Fucking Howard!

49:53.199 --> 49:55.101
Go. Now!

50:29.201 --> 50:30.370
Did I hit it?

51:01.367 --> 51:02.434
Yello?

51:11.777 --> 51:13.278
Rangi!

51:16.815 --> 51:18.216
Rangi!

51:24.422 --> 51:26.391
Rangi. Hey, Rangi!

51:27.993 --> 51:29.293
Rangi...

52:03.427 --> 52:04.862
You had one job.

52:05.730 --> 52:07.395
I had that.

52:30.587 --> 52:32.020
Shit.

52:33.690 --> 52:34.825
Run.

53:28.110 --> 53:29.545
Howard.

53:30.579 --> 53:33.379
I really don't like you
hanging around

53:33.381 --> 53:35.949
with these types of girls,
Howard.

53:35.951 --> 53:37.683
They're inappropriate.

53:42.357 --> 53:44.859
I see you've got
your own pet wraith now.

53:45.460 --> 53:47.426
Cute.

53:47.428 --> 53:49.996
I'm going to give you
one last chance

53:49.998 --> 53:52.867
and then it's no more
Mrs. Nice Guy.

53:53.601 --> 53:54.869
Come on, Howard.

53:56.004 --> 53:57.438
Come home.

54:14.555 --> 54:15.657
Fuck you, Mum.

54:28.735 --> 54:31.670
"Fuck you, Mum"?

54:31.672 --> 54:32.973
It's the best I could do.

54:37.678 --> 54:39.811
Oh, dude!

54:39.813 --> 54:41.548
Look what she did to my face!

54:44.585 --> 54:46.119
Little fucking shit!

54:57.530 --> 54:58.932
Come on. Come on!

55:24.724 --> 55:27.157
<i>Pod missing. Pod missing.</i>

55:34.667 --> 55:35.801
<i>Pod replaced.</i>

55:55.887 --> 55:57.889
- Oh.
- How do I look?

55:58.924 --> 56:01.524
- Good. Really good.
- Better?

56:01.526 --> 56:02.994
Mmm, much better, actually.

56:13.738 --> 56:15.106
It's a...

56:15.840 --> 56:17.175
It's a head.

56:17.909 --> 56:19.809
Who the hell is that?

56:19.811 --> 56:21.744
That's Uncle Dave.

56:21.746 --> 56:23.980
- You know this guy?
- Yeah.

56:23.982 --> 56:25.081
Yeah, it's Uncle Dave.

56:25.083 --> 56:26.548
Why's his head in there?

56:26.550 --> 56:27.516
Turn it on.

56:27.518 --> 56:29.187
- Well, are you sure that's...
- Turn it on.

56:38.263 --> 56:39.763
David?

56:40.631 --> 56:41.899
Can you hear me?

56:44.835 --> 56:46.070
Molly.

56:46.971 --> 56:48.603
Is that you?

56:48.605 --> 56:50.272
Yes. Yes, yes, it's me.

56:50.274 --> 56:52.207
You fucking whore!

56:52.209 --> 56:54.710
Slut! Foul witch!

56:54.712 --> 56:55.911
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

56:55.913 --> 56:58.847
Molly, they make me
say these things.

56:58.849 --> 57:01.549
- Think these things...
- Fuck you!

57:01.551 --> 57:03.652
Suck my dick!
Eat my shit!

57:03.654 --> 57:06.721
Oh, god dammit,
I can't control myself!

57:06.723 --> 57:09.191
Cocksucker!
Lick my face through an anus!

57:09.193 --> 57:12.760
You know, he kind of
reminds me of my uncle.

57:12.762 --> 57:15.730
David, why has Finnegan
done this to you?

57:19.069 --> 57:21.238
Feeding us dead souls.

57:21.904 --> 57:22.972
Making us...

57:24.274 --> 57:28.042
She's making us eat them.

57:28.044 --> 57:29.810
Filling us with power.

57:29.812 --> 57:33.114
Unclean power.

57:33.116 --> 57:36.152
"Us"? But what do you mean,
"us"? There's more of you?

57:37.320 --> 57:38.252
All of us...

57:38.254 --> 57:39.787
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

57:39.789 --> 57:41.055
All of us!

57:41.057 --> 57:44.158
Are you saying every Nekropod
has a Nekromancer head inside?

57:44.160 --> 57:45.161
Yes.

57:46.896 --> 57:48.695
Why would she do that?

57:48.697 --> 57:50.264
- She's using us...
- Arse! Fuck!

57:50.266 --> 57:51.765
Camel tit! Fuck up!

57:51.767 --> 57:54.834
Using our combined power

57:54.836 --> 57:57.839
to summon a million human
souls into the network.

57:58.207 --> 57:59.306
How?

57:59.308 --> 58:01.808
Through the game.

58:01.810 --> 58:04.145
What's she gonna do
with a million souls, Dave?

58:04.147 --> 58:06.079
Feed on them.

58:06.081 --> 58:07.714
With that much power,

58:07.716 --> 58:09.816
she'll be able to possess
the entire internet.

58:09.818 --> 58:10.984
Whoa.

58:10.986 --> 58:12.252
She'll have access

58:12.254 --> 58:13.955
to every fucking soul
on Earth.

58:15.223 --> 58:16.856
How long have we got?

58:16.858 --> 58:19.628
Not long. You have to hurry.

58:22.864 --> 58:24.166
Molly!

58:25.700 --> 58:27.736
Set me free, Molly.

58:28.403 --> 58:30.338
Set me free.

58:35.709 --> 58:37.913
Please!

58:39.281 --> 58:42.616
Your heads
are next, you fucking whores!

58:51.959 --> 58:54.228
Molly!

59:05.239 --> 59:07.808
We need to get access
to her security systems.

59:09.810 --> 59:11.910
What's the plan?

59:11.912 --> 59:13.347
I'm gonna jump myself in.

59:17.184 --> 59:18.919
I'm gonna jump inside
the network.

59:23.591 --> 59:26.227
<i>Pentagram 85 percent complete.</i>

59:33.700 --> 59:36.067
Do you hear that,
Luther?

59:36.069 --> 59:39.272
Our pentagram
is nearly complete.

59:40.373 --> 59:42.175
Do you know what that means?

59:43.343 --> 59:46.279
It means we suck their souls.

59:47.780 --> 59:50.181
I'm going to be beautiful
forever,

59:50.183 --> 59:53.353
and you'll just be
a fucking head in a box.

01:00:45.537 --> 01:00:47.239
<i>Double tap to capture.</i>

01:00:49.241 --> 01:00:51.176
Oh, shit!

01:01:09.493 --> 01:01:11.961
Whoa! I thought Molly
was jumping in.

01:01:11.963 --> 01:01:13.495
Hey, what are you doing?

01:01:13.497 --> 01:01:14.999
Bring me back.

01:01:17.068 --> 01:01:19.837
What, no!

01:01:29.513 --> 01:01:31.215
She's inside the network.

01:01:32.583 --> 01:01:34.350
I'm gonna jump her back out.

01:01:34.352 --> 01:01:36.385
Wait, wait, wait.

01:01:36.387 --> 01:01:37.286
If she's already inside,

01:01:37.288 --> 01:01:38.888
then maybe we should give her
a chance.

01:01:48.164 --> 01:01:49.332
She's doing it.

01:01:53.336 --> 01:01:55.203
She made it in.

01:02:00.043 --> 01:02:01.509
<i>Security breach.</i>

01:02:01.511 --> 01:02:03.278

<i>Security breach.</i>

01:02:04.948 --> 01:02:06.149
<i>Security breach.</i>

01:02:16.426 --> 01:02:18.093
Nearly there. Nearly.

01:02:28.871 --> 01:02:29.972
Shit.

01:02:36.145 --> 01:02:37.313
Shit. Shit.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.479
We gotta get her out of there.

01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:41.317
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way!

01:02:51.093 --> 01:02:53.260
You pull her back in.
Pull her back in!

01:02:53.262 --> 01:02:54.428
- How?
- Please try, now!

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:55.431
- Okay!
- Please!

01:02:57.366 --> 01:02:58.600
Come on!

01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:16.484
What did you do?

01:03:23.291 --> 01:03:25.593
What the fuck
happened to her head?

01:03:28.229 --> 01:03:29.530
Hey, Howie.

01:03:31.132 --> 01:03:32.933
We gotta get out of here, man.

01:04:04.598 --> 01:04:06.166
Should be me lying there.

01:04:11.171 --> 01:04:12.905
That wouldn't
do anybody any good.

01:04:15.442 --> 01:04:19.279
Could have stopped her.
Jumped her out sooner.

01:04:21.615 --> 01:04:24.181
I pushed too hard.
I fucked up. I...

01:04:24.183 --> 01:04:25.619
No, that's not fair.

01:04:27.387 --> 01:04:29.389
I practically
forced you into it.

01:04:31.123 --> 01:04:34.528
This is on me. Now she's dead.

01:04:35.662 --> 01:04:37.697
Now they're all fucking dead.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.641
I had her.

01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:53.579
I was so close.

01:04:56.582 --> 01:04:58.384
But I panicked.

01:05:02.721 --> 01:05:04.723
I pushed her away
as hard as I could

01:05:06.492 --> 01:05:07.793
because

01:05:11.664 --> 01:05:15.200
for a second there,
I could taste her.

01:05:18.336 --> 01:05:20.004
I could taste her soul.

01:05:24.677 --> 01:05:26.411
And it tasted good.

01:05:32.116 --> 01:05:34.185
My sister's soul
tasted good to you?

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:39.290
No. No, no, no.
That's not what I meant, no.

01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:41.626
No, I... I didn't, um...

01:05:42.827 --> 01:05:47.130
My sister's soul
tasted good to you.

01:05:49.199 --> 01:05:51.501
Molly, please,
that's not what I meant.

01:05:51.503 --> 01:05:54.338
And then
her fucking head explodes?

01:06:02.847 --> 01:06:04.314
You know what?

01:06:06.383 --> 01:06:09.019
I don't know who the fuck
you are, Howard North.

01:06:10.521 --> 01:06:15.225
You turn up out of the blue,
and now everybody's dead.

01:06:18.262 --> 01:06:21.596
All I know about you
is that you are related

01:06:21.598 --> 01:06:24.568
to a crazy, twisted,
psychotic freak!

01:06:25.869 --> 01:06:28.537
I don't know where you've been
the last 20 years.

01:06:28.539 --> 01:06:30.772
How do I know
you're not working for her?

01:06:30.774 --> 01:06:35.242
Like mother, like son.
A filthy fucking soul eater!

01:06:35.244 --> 01:06:38.412
Maybe I should just shoot you
in the head right fucking now!

01:06:44.655 --> 01:06:46.088
Maybe you should.

01:06:49.158 --> 01:06:50.526
Go ahead.

01:06:51.327 --> 01:06:52.395
Do it.

01:06:54.764 --> 01:06:56.898
You either trust me
or you don't.

01:07:01.837 --> 01:07:03.205
Oh.

01:07:14.584 --> 01:07:15.751
Hey!

01:07:17.252 --> 01:07:18.485
Hi.

01:07:18.487 --> 01:07:20.253
Your sister just wanted me
to tell you

01:07:20.255 --> 01:07:22.288
to stop whining
like a couple of bitches,

01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:25.126
and get her the hell
out of the box. That's all.

01:07:27.228 --> 01:07:29.462
He's right.

01:07:29.464 --> 01:07:33.199
- She's in there.
- And she's pissed.

01:07:33.201 --> 01:07:34.601
Well, how do we get her
out of there?

01:07:34.603 --> 01:07:36.839
I don't know. I've never
seen this shit before.

01:07:38.239 --> 01:07:39.672
There has to be a way
to get her out.

01:07:39.674 --> 01:07:41.374
- I don't know it.
- Well, you...

01:07:43.211 --> 01:07:45.180
Why don't we just use
the 3D printer?

01:07:59.293 --> 01:08:01.527
Anybody ever
tried this before?

01:08:01.529 --> 01:08:03.798
No, not with human souls.

01:10:24.735 --> 01:10:26.670
How does it feel?

01:10:28.974 --> 01:10:30.741
Kinda funky.

01:10:33.611 --> 01:10:35.613
Did the upload complete?

01:10:35.913 --> 01:10:37.513
No.

01:10:37.515 --> 01:10:39.715
All the data was corrupted.

01:10:39.717 --> 01:10:42.718
Don't worry. I've memorized
her entire system.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:44.855
Everything. All of it.

01:10:46.924 --> 01:10:49.026
It's all up here.

01:11:12.448 --> 01:11:14.450
Burn it.

01:11:15.718 --> 01:11:17.451
"Thanks for bringing me back
from the dead, huh."

01:11:17.453 --> 01:11:18.454
"Oh, you're welcome, Torquel."

01:11:20.857 --> 01:11:23.157
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

01:11:23.159 --> 01:11:27.430
The good news is...
I have a plan.

01:12:24.753 --> 01:12:26.420
There it is. Come on.

01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:46.605
I don't think you got it.

01:13:24.945 --> 01:13:27.246
Hey! Hey, how about this?

01:13:27.248 --> 01:13:28.880
I'll go and hook us up
to the mainframe,

01:13:28.882 --> 01:13:31.616
and you keep this
fuckin' thing off our backs.

01:13:31.618 --> 01:13:33.086
- Deal?
- Deal.

01:13:33.887 --> 01:13:36.456
- Be careful, okay?
- Okay.

01:14:03.549 --> 01:14:06.552
Three, two, one.

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.727
Yeah.

01:14:50.962 --> 01:14:51.896
Come on.

01:15:34.137 --> 01:15:37.140
- Do you think she'll make it?
- She has to.

01:15:59.728 --> 01:16:01.131
Ah.

01:16:27.256 --> 01:16:29.325
No, no, no, no! No!

01:17:12.367 --> 01:17:13.902
She's killing them all.

01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:04.117
She did it.

01:18:05.152 --> 01:18:06.220
She fuckin' blew herself up.

01:18:25.805 --> 01:18:27.905
It didn't work.

01:18:31.043 --> 01:18:32.411

to force her way out.

01:18:37.883 --> 01:18:39.151

01:18:48.294 --> 01:18:49.228
Molly...

01:18:52.565 --> 01:18:54.298
You just have to push her out.

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:56.135

Push her out of what?

01:18:56.835 --> 01:18:57.836

01:19:10.115 --> 01:19:13.852
Molly!
Molly. Molly. Molly.

01:19:30.068 --> 01:19:33.371
Who's
been a naughty boy, then?

01:19:34.472 --> 01:19:39.375
Do you have any idea
how hard I worked

01:19:39.377 --> 01:19:41.377
to make all this happen?

01:19:41.379 --> 01:19:42.944
And you
and your little bitch whore

01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:45.149
just fucked it all up for me!

01:19:48.453 --> 01:19:50.118
Go ahead.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:52.988
Punch a hole
in your girlfriend.

01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:54.191
See if I care.

01:20:04.401 --> 01:20:06.501
Why couldn't you
have just stayed

01:20:06.503 --> 01:20:10.205
under whatever rock
your father buried you under?

01:20:10.207 --> 01:20:14.076
It's going to take me years
and years

01:20:14.078 --> 01:20:16.977
and years to clean up
all this shit.

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:19.381
And I know what that feels like.

01:20:19.383 --> 01:20:22.051
Come, give Mama a kiss.

01:20:41.204 --> 01:20:42.937
Dude,

01:20:42.939 --> 01:20:44.238
you're gonna need
heaps and heaps

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.943
and heaps of therapy
after this.

01:20:48.244 --> 01:20:49.645
Uh-huh.

01:20:56.419 --> 01:20:59.655
Whoa! Slow and steady.

01:21:00.356 --> 01:21:02.023
- Yeah?
- All right.

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:29.618
Are you okay?

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:31.520
Did it work?

01:21:34.089 --> 01:21:35.555
Yeah, I think we got her.

01:21:40.195 --> 01:21:41.996
Let's take the bitch out.

01:21:50.204 --> 01:21:53.205
Are you okay with what
we're about to do?

01:21:53.207 --> 01:21:56.208
Like the whole 3D printing
of my mother, and shooting her

01:21:56.210 --> 01:21:58.012
with a plasma-powered
bazooka thing?

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.682
Yeah, fine.

01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:05.720
- Mmm-hmm.
- Just fuck off!

01:22:06.287 --> 01:22:07.455
Oh!

01:22:11.492 --> 01:22:15.761
I mean, when we bring her
up out of there,

01:22:15.763 --> 01:22:17.529
she isn't gonna look
like your mother.

01:22:17.531 --> 01:22:21.066
Her soul is about as corrupted
as you can get.

01:22:21.068 --> 01:22:23.571
It's gonna be ugly.

01:24:33.197 --> 01:24:35.533
Shoot it!

01:24:49.212 --> 01:24:50.615
No!

01:25:14.504 --> 01:25:15.572
No!

01:25:30.419 --> 01:25:31.588
Molly!

01:26:01.283 --> 01:26:02.283
Molly!

01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:06.346
Molly, now!

01:29:12.636 --> 01:29:15.972
You brought me back.

01:29:15.974 --> 01:29:19.977
- Yeah, of course I did.
- Thanks.

01:29:21.645 --> 01:29:23.647
Don't mention it.

01:29:26.116 --> 01:29:27.484
Ooh.

01:29:29.019 --> 01:29:31.154
What'd I miss?

01:30:19.535 --> 01:30:23.072
Where in the name of fuck
did I leave my car?

01:30:34.549 --> 01:30:35.550
Babe?

01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:46.526
Babe?

01:31:11.853 --> 01:31:13.121
Suck on this.

01:31:18.159 --> 01:31:19.893
Fuck off!

01:31:27.903 --> 01:31:32.903
