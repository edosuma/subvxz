Man, these guys are good.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.482
I got a plan.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.550
The next time Shaq goes
to the rim,

18:39.552 --> 18:40.651
let him dunk.

18:40.653 --> 18:44.555
Hey, Shaq, looks like the only
thing you're dunking these days

18:44.557 --> 18:45.656
is doughnuts!

18:45.658 --> 18:47.992
Oh!
Up top, ref!

18:49.329 --> 18:50.628
[ Creak, clatter ]

18:50.630 --> 18:52.230
Aah!

18:52.232 --> 18:54.465
This thing crushed my legs.

18:54.467 --> 18:58.302
Who says an old head
can't learn a new trick?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.571
And now that
Yao doesn't have a teammate,

19:00.573 --> 19:02.807
I guess we win by forfeit.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.309
Wait.
I will beat them by myself.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.445
[ Gasps ]
He speaks English.

19:07.447 --> 19:08.513
¶ Look for the hook ¶

19:08.515 --> 19:10.148
¶ Look for the hook ¶

19:10.150 --> 19:12.350
¶ Everybody, everybody,
here comes the hook ¶

19:12.352 --> 19:13.417
¶ Look for the hook ¶

19:13.419 --> 19:15.019
¶ Look for the hook ¶

19:15.021 --> 19:16.921
¶ Everybody, everybody,
here comes the hook ¶

19:16.923 --> 19:18.756
¶ Back to the studio
to make another hit ¶

19:18.758 --> 19:19.991
¶ On the tip of being funky ¶

19:19.993 --> 19:21.159
¶ This is funky as it get ¶

19:21.161 --> 19:22.593
¶ If ya trip, watch your lip ¶

19:22.595 --> 19:23.961
¶ With a quick fast
and tip fast ¶

19:23.963 --> 19:24.996
¶ Like I did when I...¶

19:24.998 --> 19:26.464
This is it, Roger.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.966
We need one basket.
One basket to win it all.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.868
And we've got trick left.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.504
Stan, I can't blow this guy
in front of all these people.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.539
No!

19:34.541 --> 19:36.774
Crisscross applesauce.

19:36.776 --> 19:39.177
But, Stan,
I'm too old for that move.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.378
No, you're not.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.979
You may be an old head,

19:41.981 --> 19:44.315
but your heart
pumps young blood.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.018
Hell yeah, it does!
Forget that doctor!

19:47.020 --> 19:50.755
Doctors are stupid, Roger.
They're just failed dentists.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.899
Crisscross applesau-- Aah!

20:01.901 --> 20:05.269
[ Both screaming ]

20:08.975 --> 20:15.213
Yao, stop!

20:15.215 --> 20:18.049
[ Triumphant music playing ]

20:33.099 --> 20:35.433
The doctor said
your leg was gonna break

20:35.435 --> 20:37.201
if you ever tried
that move.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.437
And Yao had been
guarding you close all day.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.872
It was simple math to know
that your exposed bone

20:41.874 --> 20:43.874
would pierce his calf
and take him out.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.009
Great call, Stan.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.944
And we got the hardware,
baby!

20:46.946 --> 20:48.212
Mwah!

20:48.214 --> 20:49.447
We should have been
champions.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.215
This is a Shaq-rage!

20:51.217 --> 20:52.683
Klaus:
You did your best,

20:52.685 --> 20:54.418
but you came up
a little short.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.720
There's always
next year.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.221
What?
Who are you?

20:57.223 --> 21:02.193
Oh, guys.
I'm Klaus.

21:02.195 --> 21:04.161
Have a great night!
