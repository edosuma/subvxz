WEBVTT

00:05.166 --> 00:06.394
Now.

00:06.468 --> 00:09.130
Good people of Locksley,
I have bad news.

00:09.204 --> 00:11.536
Ah, but there is good news as well.

00:11.606 --> 00:14.904
OK, now the bad news is
the Sheriff's taxman is in Clun.

00:14.975 --> 00:19.742
It's not far and he'll be here soon.
But the good news is I, me,

00:19.814 --> 00:23.112
Lucky George,
I'm here with you in Locksley.

00:23.183 --> 00:28.119
Now, I will give you good hard cash
for any jewelry,

00:28.187 --> 00:31.554
trinkets, anything of value,
I will turn to pennies.

00:31.624 --> 00:35.583
Those pennies will pay the taxman and
that will keep you out of the Sheriff's jail.

00:35.661 --> 00:41.827
So help me to help you.
Be lucky, come to Lucky George.

00:41.901 --> 00:45.268
We should have gone round,
I hate these woods.

00:50.475 --> 00:52.466
This, my friends, is an ambush.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.590 --> 01:07.887
Come to exchange some valuables for cash?

01:08.959 --> 01:11.621
- Lucky George loves a deal.
- A deal with the Sheriff?

01:12.463 --> 01:14.624
Oh, now why would you say that?

01:14.698 --> 01:16.359
I'm sorry, George,

01:16.434 --> 01:18.368
your luck's run out.

01:18.436 --> 01:19.801
I'm closing down your business.

01:21.739 --> 01:25.004
With my sword at your throat?
I don't think so!

01:25.075 --> 01:27.943
- Call your men off.
- No, I don't think so.

01:28.012 --> 01:30.673
You're surrounded.
Ah, keep your hands up!

01:32.715 --> 01:34.238
If that's what you want...

01:35.785 --> 01:36.774
Oi, come here!

01:58.607 --> 01:59.698
Now, look, lads.

02:03.478 --> 02:04.536
Only joking.

02:08.149 --> 02:11.414
Let's see if he's lucky enough
to make his own way home.

02:11.486 --> 02:12.453
Take everything.

02:13.521 --> 02:16.649
We are putting this parasite
out of business.

03:09.641 --> 03:12.973
Oi, stop!
Megan, what are you doing?

03:13.043 --> 03:14.738
We're giving these a good horse whipping.

03:14.811 --> 03:17.302
- Why?
- Said they were thatchers.

03:17.381 --> 03:20.144
Said they'd fix the hole on the roof,
then they stole this.

03:21.718 --> 03:25.380
Me mother gave it to me on my wedding day.
It's the only thing of value I own.

03:25.454 --> 03:28.890
Lucky George offered me thruppence
but I'd never sell.

03:28.958 --> 03:32.519
You touch us and you'll be in big trouble!
We are Robin Hood's men!

03:34.597 --> 03:36.690
Maybe if you try wearing a dress?

03:36.766 --> 03:38.097
I will if you will.

03:38.167 --> 03:42.365
Robin Hood could swing out of these trees
any time and bash your brains out.

03:42.438 --> 03:44.905
Or are you afraid of looking too pretty.

03:46.608 --> 03:47.939
I know that voice.

03:48.009 --> 03:50.569
Oh, surely Robin Hood couldn't
take on all of us?

03:51.780 --> 03:55.943
Robin Hood wouldn't be scared of you.
You're girls compared to him and his men.

03:56.016 --> 03:58.007
- Tom?
- Allan!

03:59.253 --> 04:00.380
You know him?

04:00.455 --> 04:03.514
- He's my brother.
- Thank heavens you're here.

04:06.227 --> 04:07.819
My purse? My sword?

04:07.895 --> 04:10.728
- My horse?
- I can explain.

04:10.798 --> 04:12.059
My nose!

04:12.131 --> 04:14.862
What kind of thing is that to do
to your brother!

04:14.935 --> 04:16.161
Is this broken?

04:16.236 --> 04:18.204
I say whip him to within an inch of his life.

04:18.271 --> 04:22.003
If you touch me again Robin Hood will string
you up from the tallest oak in Sherwood forest!

04:24.811 --> 04:26.779
This is Robin Hood, you idiot!

04:30.016 --> 04:32.177
We beg your forgiveness,
Robin of Locksley.

04:32.252 --> 04:34.049
We are humble thatchers.

04:34.786 --> 04:38.085
Times are hard, we had to thieve
or else face starvation.

04:39.091 --> 04:41.492
My friends here,
I have to look after them.

04:41.561 --> 04:43.551
Don't believe a word.

04:43.628 --> 04:46.257
Please! Have a heart.

04:46.331 --> 04:49.822
Help us out here. We'll work for you.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.495
We could join your band of worthy outlaws.

04:53.372 --> 04:55.339
What do you two have to say?

04:55.406 --> 04:58.102
They can't speak, Lord.
They've had their tongues cut out.

04:58.810 --> 05:00.902
- Why?
- For praising your work.

05:01.879 --> 05:03.744
They were overheard.

05:07.117 --> 05:08.414
Let them go.

05:10.353 --> 05:12.150
You have your necklace.

05:12.222 --> 05:15.316
We are not the Sheriff,
we do not horse-whip thieves.

05:19.329 --> 05:22.162
- Are you really thatchers?
- Course.

05:22.232 --> 05:24.757
- The finest in all England.
- You shall have a new roof!

05:25.701 --> 05:27.566
Free of charge.

05:27.636 --> 05:31.334
By the way,
I found some lost property in the forest.

05:31.408 --> 05:33.341
Anyone lost any valuables recently?

05:33.410 --> 05:34.808
Take what is yours.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.571
Courtesy of Lucky George.

05:37.479 --> 05:39.970
If I'd known I would've sold
this necklace this morning.

05:43.552 --> 05:46.019
I think we could be useful to you.

05:46.087 --> 05:47.884
See, did you notice?

05:47.955 --> 05:51.447
If I can steal something
from under the nose of the great Robin Hood,

05:51.526 --> 05:54.723
think what I can achieve
of mere mortals, eh?

05:54.796 --> 05:55.955
Allan?

05:59.199 --> 06:01.498
He's an excellent pickpocket.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.264
He's got a big mouth, I know,
but his heart is in the right place.

06:04.338 --> 06:05.305
And he's your brother.

06:05.372 --> 06:09.001
If you had a brother who'd done something
wrong, you'd give him a chance, wouldn't you?

06:16.415 --> 06:18.077
Thank you, Robin.

06:18.151 --> 06:21.086
- You will not regret it.
- You will earn these tags.

06:21.154 --> 06:22.677
You are on probation.

06:27.660 --> 06:29.093
Why are you still standing there?

06:29.161 --> 06:31.459
This woman's roof. Get to it.

06:31.530 --> 06:32.997
Go on!

06:35.700 --> 06:37.668
I'll keep an eye on him.

06:40.071 --> 06:42.369
My necklace is now yours, Eleri.

06:47.045 --> 06:51.105
- These two wanted to see you, sir.
- I'm late as it is.

06:51.181 --> 06:52.978
What do you want?

06:53.050 --> 06:56.885
We seek your blessing
and permission to marry, my lord.

06:56.955 --> 07:00.583
And what are you prepared to pay
for my blessing and permission?

07:03.627 --> 07:05.218
Come closer.

07:05.294 --> 07:07.126
Just you.

07:14.604 --> 07:15.730
Nice.

07:18.908 --> 07:19.932
This?

07:21.544 --> 07:24.637
My mother gave it to us
as a token on our engagement.

07:24.713 --> 07:26.772
It's the only thing of value I have in my family.

07:26.848 --> 07:28.441
Oh!

07:28.518 --> 07:30.007
That'll do nicely.

07:31.086 --> 07:32.883
Turn around.

07:45.467 --> 07:46.832
It's an outrage!

07:46.902 --> 07:51.463
An innocent man robbed
whilst going about his legitimate business!

07:51.539 --> 07:52.801
I need more guards.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.864
- Out of the question.
- You shall have them.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.902
About half a dozen should do.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.275
Oh, I need a new carriage an' all.

08:01.514 --> 08:04.006
Of course. See to it, Gisborne.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.655
The man's worth his weight in gold. Hm?

08:14.727 --> 08:17.321
He makes a profit, we get our taxes.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.366
It's good. A public-private-partnership.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.459
What happened, Gisborne?

08:25.270 --> 08:28.433
Robin Hood must have known
George's whereabouts.

08:28.507 --> 08:31.999
Only once, once, he risked the forest
and immediately he's robbed.

08:32.077 --> 08:34.102
Coincidence? Hm? Clue - no.

08:35.514 --> 08:37.845
Hood knows more about
our business than we do.

08:37.914 --> 08:39.883
The question is...

08:40.985 --> 08:42.043
how?

08:43.054 --> 08:45.147
- I don't know.
- Well, I do.

08:46.924 --> 08:49.256
We have a spy amongst us.

08:50.962 --> 08:53.931
And do you know what we have to do
to catch a spy?

08:53.998 --> 08:55.225
No.

08:55.298 --> 08:56.424
I do.

08:57.467 --> 08:59.129
I set a trap.

08:59.203 --> 09:02.501
Or rather, you set a trap.

09:11.747 --> 09:14.716
That's it. That's the lot.

09:14.783 --> 09:17.877
Where 's Lucky George's money?
Where 's the coins?

09:17.953 --> 09:20.615
We searched his pockets. Nothing.

09:21.257 --> 09:22.781
How can he trade if he has no money?

09:22.858 --> 09:25.292
- Maybe he spent it all?
- That's unlikely.

09:25.361 --> 09:27.158
Thing is...

09:27.229 --> 09:29.629
I woke up and we'd both been robbed.

09:29.698 --> 09:33.600
And rather than wake you I went off
to catch the thieves myself.

09:33.669 --> 09:34.965
I chased them for days...

09:36.037 --> 09:38.164
Couldn't tell the truth if
his life depended on it.

09:38.239 --> 09:39.365
Runs in the family, then.

09:40.708 --> 09:42.107
Don't make us gang up on you.

09:42.176 --> 09:44.406
Is he disrespecting our family?

09:44.479 --> 09:46.139
You rob each other in your family!

09:48.016 --> 09:49.881
My flask.

09:50.952 --> 09:52.384
Where 's my flask?

09:53.121 --> 09:54.883
I put it there, where is it?

09:56.390 --> 09:57.823
Sorry!

09:57.891 --> 09:59.518
Old habits...

10:07.067 --> 10:08.966
The old gang back together.

10:09.035 --> 10:12.472
How did they lose their tongues? No lies.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.237
For spitting at some guards.

10:17.776 --> 10:22.008
It'll be different this time.
I won't let you down again. I promise.

10:36.461 --> 10:37.655
Do you like it?

10:37.729 --> 10:39.093
Yes, I do but...

10:40.164 --> 10:42.064
It's simple silver.

10:43.701 --> 10:46.068
You have no need of gold or gaudy jewels.

10:46.136 --> 10:48.400
But really. I cannot accept it.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.666
Why not?

10:51.742 --> 10:54.142
Have I insulted you?

10:55.946 --> 10:59.642
You do not like it.
It's too plain, too simple. Take it off.

10:59.716 --> 11:02.277
No, l-I like it.

11:02.353 --> 11:03.478
I will treasure it.

11:04.388 --> 11:05.615
It is a gift of friendship.

11:05.688 --> 11:07.588
And I am very grateful.

11:10.759 --> 11:12.318
You wanted to see me, sir?

11:19.067 --> 11:21.501
Cancel the guard for
the consignment from Rotherham.

11:21.570 --> 11:23.265
- No guards?
- No guards.

11:24.272 --> 11:28.002
Guards attract attention. Why would we want to
attract attention to a chest full of silver

11:28.075 --> 11:31.773
- traveling through Sherwood Forest?
- Yes, sir.

11:32.547 --> 11:34.845
And tell no one.

11:34.916 --> 11:35.905
No one.

11:35.984 --> 11:38.451
Not even the guards themselves.

11:38.519 --> 11:39.987
Yes, sir.

11:45.493 --> 11:47.460
- Good morning, Nettlestone!
- Look at that!

11:47.527 --> 11:52.989
'Ey, you know me. Come to
Lucky, Lucky George. I know you...

11:54.101 --> 11:56.228
I thought we had put him out of business!

11:59.139 --> 12:00.766
Look at this.

12:01.941 --> 12:03.737
Where does he get his money from?

12:03.810 --> 12:05.606
They sell everything. Why?

12:06.579 --> 12:08.240
Word 's got round.

12:08.314 --> 12:10.781
Robin will return their goods,
just like he did before.

12:10.849 --> 12:13.977
I tell you what.
I will give you, for that...

12:22.828 --> 12:25.057
Whoa! Whoa! I wish you no harm.

12:28.299 --> 12:30.767
But I will relieve you of your valuables.

12:32.804 --> 12:34.567
Sorry.

12:34.639 --> 12:39.599
I thought you were a rich noblewoman looking
to donate your fancy jewels to a good cause.

12:39.677 --> 12:40.735
You knew it was me.

12:41.913 --> 12:44.437
You shouldn't be riding alone through the forest.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.711
There are some very unsavory
characters about.

12:47.784 --> 12:49.581
Outlaws, you know.

12:51.621 --> 12:53.521
- What's this?
- Don't touch.

12:54.424 --> 12:56.721
It's very pretty.

12:56.793 --> 12:58.760
- Have I seen it before?
- No. It was a gift.

12:58.828 --> 13:01.297
- From whom?
- Does it matter?

13:01.364 --> 13:03.525
- I should be going.
- I don't know.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.123
- Does it?
- No.

13:07.136 --> 13:08.695
- Gisborne.
- What?

13:08.771 --> 13:11.934
- Just a guess. Am I right?
- As it happens.

13:13.743 --> 13:15.370
- Interesting.
- Why interesting?

13:15.444 --> 13:17.469
I have seen it before.

13:17.546 --> 13:20.070
Around the neck of a young girl from Locksley.

13:20.148 --> 13:21.776
It was given to her by her mother.

13:22.952 --> 13:27.251
- Yes, and?
- And here it is around your neck.

13:29.057 --> 13:30.547
Gisborne stole it from the girl?

13:30.625 --> 13:33.594
I can't imagine she gave it to him willingly.

13:33.661 --> 13:37.426
But it's not like you stole it
from the poor girl yourself.

13:37.498 --> 13:38.863
And you obviously like it.

13:38.933 --> 13:43.494
And it is certainly a special and thoughtful gift
from a man that clearly means a lot to you.

13:44.838 --> 13:46.738
- Take it back to the girl.
- Gladly.

13:48.742 --> 13:50.369
What will you say to Gisborne?

13:50.444 --> 13:52.673
Ask her not to wear it in public.

13:52.745 --> 13:53.712
He will never know.

13:57.584 --> 14:01.144
Keep the necklace.
I can find her another.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.654
It was a gift from her mother.

14:03.722 --> 14:06.214
Take it. I can handle Gisborne.

14:24.241 --> 14:26.368
It's time we got to work, boys.

14:27.311 --> 14:29.176
Let's hit the road.

14:30.048 --> 14:31.514
Oi!

14:34.585 --> 14:37.850
- Why did you go to Gisborne?
- He is our master now.

14:37.922 --> 14:39.048
And what about this?

14:39.123 --> 14:41.420
He took it as his fee for our wedding.
How did you...

14:41.491 --> 14:43.289
Doesn't matter.

14:44.261 --> 14:45.693
You still want to marry?

14:46.629 --> 14:47.926
Well, then let me marry you.

14:47.997 --> 14:50.364
- Does that count?
- Of course it does.

14:50.434 --> 14:52.060
And I am much cheaper than Gisborne.

14:52.135 --> 14:57.095
- Here, you should be getting back.
- Thank you, Robin.

15:00.410 --> 15:03.867
- Lucky George?
- Nettlestone. More guards. And a new carriage.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.379
So, he is engaged with the Sheriff.

15:05.448 --> 15:08.314
The villagers are all giving him their stuff.

15:08.383 --> 15:10.783
Cheap, because they think
you'll give everything back.

15:10.854 --> 15:14.482
First thing in the morning we find him
and take his toys away.

15:14.556 --> 15:16.490
- For good.
- Robin.

15:22.831 --> 15:25.697
- I've lost my brother.
- It's a big forest.

15:25.766 --> 15:27.166
They must have gone east.

15:27.235 --> 15:29.635
He didn't tell me where he was off to though.

15:29.704 --> 15:31.672
I've got a bad feeling about this.

15:32.907 --> 15:34.204
Fetch the horses.

15:34.842 --> 15:36.810
East is towards Knighton.

15:41.648 --> 15:43.775
Nice house means rich pickings.

15:45.218 --> 15:46.412
Come on.

15:46.486 --> 15:48.113
Round the back.

15:58.765 --> 16:02.222
...and the daughter of this house.
Get away from here!

16:37.167 --> 16:38.759
Stop!

16:42.039 --> 16:45.133
- What is going on?
- Thank goodness you're here.

16:45.208 --> 16:46.970
This is Robin Hood, you're in big trouble!

16:47.043 --> 16:49.204
What are you doing?

16:50.313 --> 16:52.680
- I am so sorry.
- These men were robbing my house!

16:52.748 --> 16:56.013
Yes. We're robbing his house!
That's what we do!

16:56.085 --> 16:58.076
We were trying to show the top man
what we can do!

16:58.154 --> 16:59.882
These people are our friends!

16:59.955 --> 17:03.015
- Now you tell me! I thought they were...
- You don't think!

17:03.091 --> 17:04.957
You can't think!

17:05.026 --> 17:07.493
- Are you hurt?
- Only my pride.

17:07.561 --> 17:10.861
- These are your men?
- Not for much longer. I promise.

17:12.034 --> 17:13.193
Apologize!

17:13.268 --> 17:15.292
Apologize for the disturbance.

17:15.369 --> 17:17.337
- Now!
- Do as you're told.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.778
- Sorry.
- Louder.

17:28.849 --> 17:30.374
Sorry!

17:30.451 --> 17:31.884
I knew nothing about this.

17:31.952 --> 17:33.715
They will be punished, you have my word.

17:34.520 --> 17:36.818
Robin, I'm so sorry...

17:36.890 --> 17:39.154
Just take them away!

17:50.636 --> 17:53.696
There 's a consignment of silver
coming down the Great North Road.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.832
I was on my way to intercept it.

17:55.907 --> 17:58.432
- You?
- Yes, me.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.672
It is unguarded so as not to attract attention.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.715
- A simple cart.
- And how do you know this?

18:03.782 --> 18:05.409
Another present from Gisborne?

18:06.418 --> 18:08.648
Look, I need to stay with my father.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.277
If you want it you must hurry.

18:11.089 --> 18:12.056
Thank you.

18:13.190 --> 18:15.283
Much, the North Road.

18:33.043 --> 18:34.010
Sorry about that.

18:34.744 --> 18:36.678
We arrived as quickly as we could!

18:43.553 --> 18:46.283
A decoy. What's the Sheriff up to now?

18:48.391 --> 18:51.849
Well, it looks like
we've all had a wasted journey.

18:54.530 --> 18:56.897
Well done, Gisborne.

18:59.334 --> 19:01.529
Hood wanted silver.

19:01.603 --> 19:04.663
Instead he got this.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.973
So, who did you tell?

19:14.749 --> 19:16.842
My sergeant.

19:16.918 --> 19:19.045
Anyone else?

19:19.120 --> 19:21.315
No.

19:21.389 --> 19:24.516
- You're sure?
- Only my sergeant. It must be him.

19:29.196 --> 19:30.163
Make him suffer.

19:31.532 --> 19:33.431
Oh, I will.

19:34.501 --> 19:37.402
You know I agreed you should
make up with your brother?

19:37.471 --> 19:38.767
- Yeah?
- I've changed my mind.

19:38.838 --> 19:40.397
He was trying to impress you.

19:41.475 --> 19:46.571
And he didn't realize who he was robbing.
It's a big house. He doesn't think.

19:46.646 --> 19:50.240
Anyway, you don't have to trust them, just me.
I should have kept an eye on him.

19:50.316 --> 19:51.578
Yes. You should have.

19:51.650 --> 19:54.517
Look, when have I ever asked you for anything?

19:54.587 --> 19:56.851
All right, apart from saving my life.

19:57.857 --> 20:00.951
He has made a lot of mistakes.
I know, I tried to help him.

20:02.694 --> 20:04.719
Look, I was like him once.

20:04.796 --> 20:06.263
Out of control.

20:07.298 --> 20:09.266
But I've changed...

20:10.635 --> 20:14.731
Because of you. Because of being here.
If you could give him a second chance...

20:14.806 --> 20:17.172
- He's had a second chance.
- But if he was with us.

20:17.242 --> 20:19.004
With decent men. He could change.

20:20.411 --> 20:24.507
If I take control, properly,
you won't have to worry about him.

20:26.316 --> 20:28.614
Please? One more chance?

20:28.684 --> 20:32.246
He stole from you.
And you still defend him.

20:32.955 --> 20:34.389
He's my brother.

20:38.327 --> 20:39.294
One more chance.

20:40.396 --> 20:41.864
Thank you.

20:48.971 --> 20:51.997
Last chance. Do you understand?

20:52.073 --> 20:53.871
All right.

20:57.179 --> 20:58.510
Get up!

20:58.914 --> 21:00.279
Get up!

21:00.348 --> 21:01.713
They've gone.

21:01.783 --> 21:04.081
- Gone?
- And they've taken everything.

21:04.986 --> 21:08.114
- Everything?
- Clothes, money, horses.

21:08.190 --> 21:09.713
Everything.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.724
I will kill him.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.317
I'm gonna kill him.

21:13.395 --> 21:15.954
Bury him, dig him up and kill him again!

21:30.578 --> 21:35.708
In the name of Robin Hood,
hand over the money and we won't harm you.

21:35.782 --> 21:37.306
Whoa! Son!

21:37.383 --> 21:38.748
Don't even think about it.

21:38.818 --> 21:41.753
There are six guards relieving
themselves in the forest behind you.

21:41.821 --> 21:43.344
Do you expect me to believe that?

21:43.423 --> 21:46.186
Turn around, see for yourself.

21:46.258 --> 21:48.556
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

22:08.579 --> 22:09.773
They're to hang.

22:14.952 --> 22:19.355
They have lied to us, stolen from us,
they're nothing but trouble.

22:19.423 --> 22:20.481
Let them hang.

22:25.195 --> 22:26.822
I agree.

22:29.299 --> 22:30.925
You do?

22:33.603 --> 22:35.503
My brother had more chances than he deserved.

22:35.572 --> 22:37.038
Does he deserve to die?

22:38.440 --> 22:39.738
Do we?

22:41.610 --> 22:44.511
If we go to Nottingham
we'll end up joining him on the scaffold.

22:44.580 --> 22:45.979
They took some of our tags.

22:47.082 --> 22:50.916
The Sheriff's crowing.
Thinks he's got Robin Hood's men.

22:50.986 --> 22:52.954
Now it's like he's daring us to rescue them.

22:54.189 --> 22:56.520
My brother was never part of this gang, was he?

22:57.859 --> 23:00.885
We trusted them and they let us down.
That's it.

23:00.962 --> 23:02.793
We'd be fools to walk into a trap for them.

23:05.499 --> 23:06.865
Does anyone disagree with me?

23:23.183 --> 23:24.480
What do you want?

23:24.551 --> 23:27.178
- To talk.
- So talk.

23:36.997 --> 23:38.293
Ah! You can talk from there.

23:40.933 --> 23:42.126
- What?
- Nothing.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.034
- You were looking at me.
- That's just the way my eyes were pointing.

23:46.972 --> 23:48.836
I'm sorry about yesterday.

23:49.874 --> 23:51.274
How's your father?

23:51.343 --> 23:53.641
- I hear your men are going to hang.
- They're not my men.

23:53.712 --> 23:56.044
They were your men last night.

23:57.115 --> 24:00.346
The Sheriff is hanging them in my name,
hoping I'll turn up to rescue them.

24:01.752 --> 24:03.982
But my men think it's a trap.

24:04.055 --> 24:06.579
Has your good friend Guy of Gisborne
said anything to you?

24:07.425 --> 24:09.051
I think he was a little preoccupied.

24:09.126 --> 24:11.651
But I will go to the castle
to see what I can find out.

24:13.464 --> 24:16.262
If I do not rescue them,
people will think I cannot protect my men.

24:18.268 --> 24:20.395
Do I risk us all to save them?

24:20.471 --> 24:22.496
You are a good man, Robin.

24:22.573 --> 24:24.403
Nothing will change that.

24:30.813 --> 24:32.474
That won't help you make your decision.

24:32.548 --> 24:34.539
- It might.
- It won't.

24:56.071 --> 24:58.096
- Marian.
- Sir Guy.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.030
So you did not like it after all?

25:03.911 --> 25:05.139
The necklace.

25:05.212 --> 25:08.045
No, I do. It's at home.

25:08.115 --> 25:10.606
- You didn't think to wear it?
- It is very precious to me.

25:10.684 --> 25:12.549
I would not want to lose it.

25:14.688 --> 25:16.622
Come away. This is not for your ears.

25:16.690 --> 25:18.418
What is it?

25:18.491 --> 25:21.221
Do you know the worst crime
a man can commit?

25:21.294 --> 25:22.818
Murder?

25:22.896 --> 25:24.864
Betrayal.

25:26.499 --> 25:30.799
My sergeant swore loyalty to me
and then he stabbed me in the back.

25:30.870 --> 25:33.201
- He hasn't admitted it yet but he will.
- Admit what?

25:34.673 --> 25:36.470
We set a trap to flush out a spy.

25:37.543 --> 25:39.704
An unguarded cart. Someone told Robin Hood.

25:39.778 --> 25:42.042
But what if it wasn't him?

25:42.114 --> 25:45.049
My sergeant was the only one that knew.

25:45.117 --> 25:47.448
He was the only one I told.

25:47.518 --> 25:49.543
Please, Sir Guy, do not do this.

25:53.558 --> 25:54.650
You understand loyalty?

25:56.327 --> 25:58.124
- Y...
- The importance of loyalty?

25:58.196 --> 26:02.155
- Yes, I do. But...
- So... he must pay for his crime.

26:11.408 --> 26:13.706
Yes, but did Marian say it was a trap?

26:13.778 --> 26:16.439
- She didn't know.
- Well, then we cannot go.

26:16.513 --> 26:19.710
We cannot risk our own lives
for three worthless rascals.

26:19.783 --> 26:21.774
We're going to Nottingham.

26:22.586 --> 26:23.917
I'll see you there.

26:26.722 --> 26:28.088
Master, surely...

26:28.157 --> 26:30.182
- Why are we...
- For family.

26:30.259 --> 26:32.489
For Allan's brother.

26:33.162 --> 26:36.222
We do not let the Sheriff hang our family,

26:36.297 --> 26:38.356
no matter how unreliable they may be.

26:40.135 --> 26:41.624
Robin...

26:42.704 --> 26:43.966
God bless you, my friend.

26:44.039 --> 26:45.665
Don't mention it, my friend.

26:52.546 --> 26:54.071
Bring the girl.

27:07.661 --> 27:09.322
Oh, the bride.

27:09.396 --> 27:11.159
Yes, my lord?

27:13.032 --> 27:15.000
Lower your collar.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.106
Where did you get this?

27:29.181 --> 27:31.512
My mother gave it to me.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.778
And I took it from you.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.476
How did you get it back?

27:38.990 --> 27:41.185
Robin Hood gave it to me.

27:45.864 --> 27:47.491
Let's have a look.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.496
I'll give you a ha'penny for it.

27:51.570 --> 27:52.661
Keep it.

27:52.736 --> 27:57.366
- It means nothing to me.
- Lucky Lucky George!

28:05.716 --> 28:07.046
I've been betrayed.

28:07.116 --> 28:09.209
Again? Hm! Making a habit of it, aren't you?

28:09.285 --> 28:10.844
Not again.

28:10.921 --> 28:14.982
I was wrong.
My sergeant died an innocent man.

28:15.058 --> 28:17.652
Well, I'm sure he was guilty of something.

28:21.598 --> 28:22.963
It was Marian.

28:23.533 --> 28:25.057
I have the proof.

28:26.368 --> 28:27.996
Marian?

28:29.538 --> 28:31.166
Well, well, well...

28:32.241 --> 28:35.107
Am I surprised? Clue -

28:35.177 --> 28:36.144
no.

28:36.211 --> 28:39.772
It's always the girl.
I told you.

28:39.848 --> 28:42.078
Women. Lepers.

28:44.152 --> 28:46.949
Aww, you're really hurt, hmm?

28:48.356 --> 28:52.690
Can you feel the hot metal of the knife
twisting in your back, hm?

28:52.760 --> 28:55.251
All the time she was smiling at you,

28:55.329 --> 28:58.196
but really she was laughing at you,

28:58.265 --> 29:01.062
betraying you, despising you,

29:02.470 --> 29:04.334
humiliating you.

29:06.339 --> 29:09.103
And what do you want to do to her now?

29:10.710 --> 29:12.735
Go.

29:12.812 --> 29:15.143
And enjoy it.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.082
Ah!

29:20.153 --> 29:21.881
In there.

29:21.955 --> 29:23.888
Yeah. That's the lot that tried to rob me.

29:25.024 --> 29:27.857
- Have pity on us.
- Get off me!

29:27.926 --> 29:29.257
This was clean on!

29:31.897 --> 29:34.888
Robin will save us. He'll be here!

29:34.967 --> 29:36.991
Oh, no, he won't!

29:52.149 --> 29:55.175
- What are you doing?
- I must speak to Robin.

29:55.252 --> 29:56.879
Why? What's happened?

29:56.953 --> 29:59.751
Lord Gisborne took the necklace from me
and made me tell him...

30:00.657 --> 30:02.056
Kiss me.

30:10.000 --> 30:10.967
Sorry.

30:11.702 --> 30:13.191
Much!

30:13.269 --> 30:14.702
Ah...

30:15.638 --> 30:16.696
Tell me what happened.

30:20.242 --> 30:21.209
We have a problem.

30:21.277 --> 30:25.440
We have many problems,
most of them guard -shaped. Come on.

30:25.513 --> 30:28.005
Remember the necklace?
Lucky George has got it.

30:28.084 --> 30:30.109
And Gisborne knows you gave it to Eleri.

30:30.186 --> 30:31.380
What? How?

30:31.454 --> 30:32.750
She was scared out of her wits.

30:39.794 --> 30:42.592
We rescue Tom and then we warn Marian.

30:42.664 --> 30:43.994
Now, get the uniforms, come on.

30:54.842 --> 30:56.400
Ah!

31:04.517 --> 31:06.508
All those eager faces.

31:10.623 --> 31:14.059
You're all expecting Robin Hood
to turn up, aren't you? Hm?

31:14.127 --> 31:17.096
Do a few tricks
with his bow and arrow?

31:17.163 --> 31:21.065
Well, this is no time for schoolboy tricks.

31:21.134 --> 31:23.102
This is justice.

31:23.935 --> 31:25.233
We have laws.

31:26.104 --> 31:29.904
Robin Hood has no respect for the law.

31:29.975 --> 31:32.375
Robin Hood flouts the law.

31:32.444 --> 31:36.608
He would have us all be criminals,
murdering and stealing.

31:36.680 --> 31:41.550
And yet still, you wait here expecting him
to come and save one of his own.

31:42.787 --> 31:44.448
Yes, of course you do.

31:44.522 --> 31:46.786
Which is why...

31:46.857 --> 31:50.793
I have brought the hanging forward by one hour.

31:50.861 --> 31:51.919
Look up there!

32:00.804 --> 32:02.897
You're too late, Robin Hood!

32:05.508 --> 32:06.873
Your men are already dead!

32:10.512 --> 32:14.074
Ooh, I wish you could have seen
the look on their faces

32:14.150 --> 32:19.052
just before they realized
that you weren't coming to rescue them.

32:22.224 --> 32:24.419
Oh, it was very moving.

32:24.493 --> 32:26.961
First there was...

32:27.029 --> 32:28.428
disappointment...

32:28.497 --> 32:31.625
tinged with confusion,

32:32.733 --> 32:36.829
soon to be replaced by anger and then tears,

32:36.904 --> 32:41.170
just before they realized
that it was the final, fatal drop.

32:41.242 --> 32:42.709
It was very moving, very touching.

32:44.412 --> 32:45.401
Yes!

32:45.479 --> 32:48.038
I wish you could have seen that, Hood!

32:50.550 --> 32:52.108
Well, thank you very much.

32:54.354 --> 32:58.222
Oh, will one of you tell Robin Hood
if you do see him?

32:59.593 --> 33:01.117
Thank you.

33:02.629 --> 33:04.927
Eager, smiling faces.

33:05.698 --> 33:06.665
Good.

33:07.800 --> 33:11.896
All in a day's work. Ha! Ha!

33:11.971 --> 33:13.905
Sheriff coming through!

33:22.981 --> 33:24.540
Robin. Marian?

33:28.186 --> 33:30.518
You have come for the belongings
of the hanged man.

33:30.588 --> 33:31.987
Tom A Dale.

33:32.056 --> 33:34.616
You are his cousin. Bring them here quickly!

33:58.982 --> 34:00.676
Gisborne knows you gave me the necklace.

34:00.750 --> 34:03.742
He knows you betrayed him.
You are in grave danger.

34:03.819 --> 34:06.014
- No...
- I will get it back for you.

34:06.088 --> 34:07.919
He'll be leaving for Knighton Hall now.

34:07.990 --> 34:09.355
My father.

34:10.793 --> 34:12.260
- Wait for me.
- I can't leave him.

34:12.328 --> 34:14.795
Marian, you cannot go home now.
It is too dangerous.

34:14.862 --> 34:17.560
He is weak already,
he cannot defend himself if...

34:17.632 --> 34:19.464
Marian, look at me.

34:19.534 --> 34:21.628
Look at me. Give me time.

34:21.703 --> 34:23.670
I will get you the necklace.

34:32.179 --> 34:34.409
Will, go and find Allan and Djaq.

34:36.050 --> 34:37.746
We need to find Lucky George.

34:37.819 --> 34:39.809
He has to be here.

34:43.556 --> 34:44.649
What do you want?

34:49.663 --> 34:50.755
Maybe some salt?

34:51.831 --> 34:52.958
Where 's Marian?

34:54.600 --> 34:55.567
Good question.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.967
If you've hurt her...

34:58.037 --> 34:59.868
If you've done anything to her...

35:01.574 --> 35:02.632
You'll what?

35:06.012 --> 35:08.207
- Speak of the devil.
- Sir Guy.

35:08.281 --> 35:10.578
- We were not expecting you.
- I know.

35:11.451 --> 35:13.350
Sorry.

35:13.419 --> 35:15.546
I just popped in for a little chat.

35:19.057 --> 35:21.854
- Where have you been?
- At the hanging.

35:21.926 --> 35:23.724
Can we get you something to drink?

35:24.396 --> 35:25.794
I don't think so.

35:34.405 --> 35:35.736
Show me your necklace.

35:36.707 --> 35:37.674
What necklace?

35:39.610 --> 35:41.578
If I may say, Sir Guy...

35:41.645 --> 35:43.670
Show me your necklace.

35:51.654 --> 35:53.952
Robin is looking for you.

35:55.391 --> 35:57.450
- I'm sorry.
- Give us a moment.

36:08.270 --> 36:11.137
I had a brother. A twin.

36:13.142 --> 36:15.974
He was killed in your Crusades.

36:20.915 --> 36:21.939
I became him.

36:22.016 --> 36:23.574
His name was Djaq.

36:25.119 --> 36:27.713
He still lives here,

36:28.790 --> 36:30.086
inside me.

36:30.892 --> 36:33.189
Like your brother lives inside you.

36:34.361 --> 36:35.659
That's what I worry about.

36:38.966 --> 36:40.296
Don't you want to take a look?

36:41.102 --> 36:42.625
Look at what?

36:42.702 --> 36:44.135
A sack of rags.

36:45.138 --> 36:47.629
It's not much to show for a life.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.551
- You would have me prove my innocence?
- Show me the necklace.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.883
- Have I committed a crime?
- Show me the necklace.

37:02.955 --> 37:06.288
I will not. This is the end of our friendship.

37:06.358 --> 37:09.019
How can I be friends with someone
who demands I prove my innocence

37:09.095 --> 37:10.289
without stating my crime?

37:10.362 --> 37:12.421
You betrayed me to Robin Hood.

37:12.498 --> 37:17.525
You gave him the necklace. You told him
of my plan. And now you will pay the price.

37:18.636 --> 37:20.570
- You have no proof.
- And you have no necklace.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.230
- It is upstairs.
- No, it's not.

37:22.307 --> 37:24.275
It is in my bedchamber.
I will fetch it for you.

37:24.342 --> 37:26.469
Don't waste my time.

37:27.277 --> 37:28.905
Please.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.606
Let me prove myself to you.

37:51.567 --> 37:53.398
Driver! W hy are we stopping?

37:55.537 --> 37:57.369
What is it this time?

37:57.440 --> 37:58.667
Whoa, lads...

37:59.741 --> 38:02.676
- The necklace Gisborne gave you.
- What, er, silver? Celtic design?

38:02.744 --> 38:04.735
- Yes.
- Never seen it.

38:07.015 --> 38:08.312
One chance.

38:08.651 --> 38:13.110
Give us the necklace or we kill you
and search your goods ourselves.

38:13.188 --> 38:14.587
This is no game.

38:17.158 --> 38:20.992
Erm, er, look, just leave me the money
and I'll give you the necklace.

38:21.061 --> 38:22.654
Give us the necklace first.

38:23.430 --> 38:24.522
Er, right. Um...

38:27.002 --> 38:28.127
It's gone.

38:28.202 --> 38:30.636
No, no, no, I swear.
I had it but it's gone!

38:33.941 --> 38:35.636
- Master, if we don't have...
- I know!

38:35.709 --> 38:37.939
- What do we do?
- I found Allan and Djaq. They found...

38:38.012 --> 38:39.478
Something you might be interested in.

38:39.546 --> 38:41.707
- How?
- I have to get this to Marian.

38:41.781 --> 38:43.840
You are lucky.

38:43.917 --> 38:46.044
Take everything.
And this time I mean everything.

38:57.597 --> 38:59.962
Trying to make it look like a robbery?

39:02.669 --> 39:04.932
Oh, my!

39:05.003 --> 39:07.767
Robin Hood's broken in
and stolen the necklace!

39:13.144 --> 39:14.441
I thought we were friends.

39:15.112 --> 39:16.238
So did I.

39:18.015 --> 39:22.384
The only reason you paid me any attention

39:22.453 --> 39:24.387
was to feed information to my enemy.

39:24.455 --> 39:25.922
That's not true.

39:26.991 --> 39:28.959
Why persist with lies?

39:30.094 --> 39:31.061
You're dead anyway.

39:35.432 --> 39:38.890
Do you still not have the courage
to tell me the truth?

39:40.837 --> 39:42.805
The truth?

39:44.040 --> 39:47.339
The truth is, this country
is being choked to death.

39:48.811 --> 39:54.443
The truth is, honest people
are being forced to lie and cheat and steal.

39:54.516 --> 39:58.849
And if you really want the truth,
then you should know that I...

40:03.359 --> 40:04.485
What?

40:09.163 --> 40:11.358
I have something to show you.

40:25.512 --> 40:28.073
It's not possible.

40:29.183 --> 40:32.481
Feel it. It is real.

40:34.087 --> 40:35.987
And you owe me an apology.

40:38.591 --> 40:40.219
I'm sorry.

40:42.061 --> 40:43.528
I was wrong.

40:47.867 --> 40:50.392
Marian, I told the Sheriff that you betrayed us.

40:50.469 --> 40:52.732
Tell him you were mistaken.

40:52.804 --> 40:56.741
- He's expecting news of your arrest.
- Show him the necklace.

40:56.808 --> 41:00.005
No necklace will persuade the Sheriff.

41:00.078 --> 41:03.104
How could he trust you after this?
I cannot protect you.

41:03.181 --> 41:04.671
You must. It is proof.

41:04.749 --> 41:09.550
You have already defied the Sheriff once.
Suspicion will cling to you and your father.

41:09.621 --> 41:12.350
You must prove your loyalty beyond all doubt.

41:12.424 --> 41:14.084
How?

41:14.993 --> 41:17.119
Marry me.

41:18.096 --> 41:21.394
It's the only way. As Lady Gisborne
I could protect you. What do you say?

41:22.299 --> 41:24.324
You leave me no time to think.

41:24.401 --> 41:27.029
A moment ago you'd have me hanged
and now you want to marry me?

41:27.104 --> 41:30.073
- Is it so difficult to prove your loyalty?
- I am loyal but...

41:30.140 --> 41:31.663
But what?

41:32.742 --> 41:34.733
I know you were once betrothed to Robin Hood.

41:34.811 --> 41:37.211
I was a girl then.

41:37.280 --> 41:40.738
Would you still hesitate
if he were asking the question?

41:44.354 --> 41:45.911
I would never marry him.

41:48.957 --> 41:50.083
I despise Robin Hood.

41:52.327 --> 41:53.556
Really?

41:58.066 --> 41:59.693
So what about me?

42:02.637 --> 42:04.605
Will you...

42:04.673 --> 42:07.163
marry... me?

42:15.549 --> 42:17.016
Yes.

42:18.953 --> 42:20.944
I will marry you.

42:21.989 --> 42:24.821
I will marry you the day
King Richard returns to England.

42:36.602 --> 42:39.833
Shall we go downstairs
and tell my father the good news?

42:39.905 --> 42:41.373
Yes.

42:43.410 --> 42:45.377
I have an apology to make.

42:54.353 --> 42:56.115
Sorry!

43:12.503 --> 43:15.266
I now pronounce you man and wife.

43:15.338 --> 43:17.136
You may kiss the bride.

43:23.647 --> 43:26.479
A gift.

43:27.583 --> 43:29.051
From Lucky George.

43:29.119 --> 43:30.916
Thank you. For everything.

43:35.124 --> 43:37.786
I love a wedding.

43:37.860 --> 43:40.124
And this is one of the best cakes
I have ever tasted.
