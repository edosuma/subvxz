14:50.223 --> 14:52.556
"They need our absence."

we both shared this passion,

14:58.689 --> 15:00.021

15:01.109 --> 15:02.645

15:04.362 --> 15:07.605
trying to run before
we'd learned to walk.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.990

I suppose.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.948
But we learned.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.196

15:16.916 --> 15:18.407

Really close.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.011
So, what do you
need from me?

16:13.431 --> 16:15.969
MILLS: There was a tracking
system in place at your park.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.099
Radio-frequency ID chips
in each dinosaur.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.301
- I remember.
- Right.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.095
MILLS: So, if we could
access that system,

16:21.272 --> 16:24.015
our ability to locate and
capture those animals safely

16:24.484 --> 16:25.565
would increase tenfold.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.148
We need your handprint
to access the system,

16:28.488 --> 16:30.104
but what I really need,
Claire,

16:31.824 --> 16:32.814
is you.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.659
Moving endangered species
isn't exactly legal,

16:35.828 --> 16:37.285
but it's the right thing
to do.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.954
No one knows this park
as well as you do

16:39.040 --> 16:40.326
and we need that expertise.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.035
- How many can you save?
- Eleven species. For sure.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.379
I mean, more if we can,
but time is against us.

16:47.507 --> 16:51.217
I'm afraid there is
one animal in particular

16:51.802 --> 16:53.759
that poses a real challenge
for us.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.592
- Blue.
- I didn't know she had a name,

16:56.766 --> 16:58.348
but Blue is potentially

16:58.434 --> 17:00.721
the second-most intelligent
piece of life on this planet

17:00.895 --> 17:03.433
and she's the last of her kind.
She must be preserved.

17:03.606 --> 17:06.690
She can pick up your scent a mile off.
You'll never capture her.

17:07.401 --> 17:11.736
Well, we thought you might
know someone who could help.
