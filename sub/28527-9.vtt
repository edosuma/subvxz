00:07.924 --> 00:09.092
[Liv] How are you feeling?

00:09.175 --> 00:11.136
You're smiling, that's a good sign.

00:11.219 --> 00:12.971
<i>I think my face is just doing this.</i>

00:13.471 --> 00:16.725
<i>But I'm okay. Just like I was okay</i>
<i>when you checked an hour ago.</i>

00:17.600 --> 00:18.560
Well, I'm proud of you.

00:19.686 --> 00:23.148
That sounded weird. I just...
I know that you're really trying,

00:23.231 --> 00:24.315
and that means a lot to me.

00:24.983 --> 00:28.319
<i>Just wish it meant anything to my head.</i>

00:28.403 --> 00:29.446
You're doing great.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.655
I'll check in after work.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.782
[footsteps approaching]

00:35.618 --> 00:38.121
Asiago jalapeño? Yes.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.040
Thanks for bringing these over.

00:40.123 --> 00:41.958
I take it Ravi hasn't been feeding you.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.836
You know, when we first met,
he'd cook for me,

00:44.919 --> 00:46.588
he'd buy me pretty things.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.548
But now that he knows
that he has my heart,

00:48.631 --> 00:50.425
it's like the bromance is gone.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.678
When you kicked Utopium,
what was the hardest part?

00:53.762 --> 00:54.596
Why?

00:55.346 --> 00:56.389
It's just my...

00:57.682 --> 00:58.933
-Martin...
-Your dad?

00:59.184 --> 01:01.686
That word still does not come
naturally to me. It's like...

01:02.187 --> 01:04.814
calling a pine cone "your majesty."

01:05.982 --> 01:08.485
Anyway, he's three days in
on this whole detox thing,

01:08.568 --> 01:11.654
and I know he'll survive
but I just hate to see him suffer.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.156
He should be past the worst part.

01:13.948 --> 01:16.076
It can be done. Look at me now.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.162
Yeah, someone who grams their breakfast.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.582
[chuckles] No. Sorry,
I'm just checking Sloane Mills' Instagram.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.168
She hasn't returned our calls,

01:25.251 --> 01:26.628
so I'm trying to figure out
what she's up to.

01:26.711 --> 01:29.464
Well, wherever she is,
she's certainly keeping it classy.

01:31.508 --> 01:35.094
[Dolly] Let's see here. What kind of day
should our girl be having?

01:35.178 --> 01:37.138
How about a nice boozy brunch?

01:37.222 --> 01:38.807
[Benny laughing]

01:38.890 --> 01:44.187
Hashtag hair of the dog, hashtag yum,
hashtag eggs bennie.

01:45.104 --> 01:48.358
Just another day in the life
of our favorite general's daughter.

01:50.735 --> 01:51.778
[muffled screaming]

01:52.153 --> 01:53.154
Good morning, Sloane.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.198
-Let's see how your boyfriend's doing?
-[screams loudly]

01:57.784 --> 01:59.786
[muffled screaming]

02:01.371 --> 02:02.831
I say they're almost ready.

02:07.669 --> 02:09.504
[theme music playing]

02:31.901 --> 02:34.737
[Liv] Such a shame.
So young, so full of promise.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.282
And then, what happened?

02:38.575 --> 02:40.160
[Clive] Prank gone wrong, it seems.

02:40.618 --> 02:41.828
It's a weird case.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.872
Laurie-Beth Spano.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.083
Twenty years back,
she's in the Miss Future Seattle Pageant.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.209
Collapses onstage.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.461
Anaphylactic shock, goes into a coma.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.964
Investigation found
that the makeup in her bag

02:53.047 --> 02:55.383
had been spiked with rose hip extract.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.970
Usually, it would just give you a rash,
but she was allergic, so...

02:59.053 --> 03:01.264
Twenty-year coma. God, poor girl.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.474
They arrested another girl at the pageant.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.476
Velma Charlet.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.895
Real rough-looking customer.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.688
Her prints were on the tainted compact.

03:08.771 --> 03:11.149
Public defender pressed her
to take a plea deal,

03:11.232 --> 03:12.650
so she signed a statement saying

03:12.734 --> 03:14.903
she spiked Laurie-Beth's face powder
as a prank.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.321
Did three years.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.740
Now the victim died,
it's a whole new charge.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.116
Manslaughter.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.536
But Velma now says she's innocent.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.454
Well, then...

03:26.456 --> 03:28.499
Looks like we're going back to the '90s.

03:28.583 --> 03:29.542
-[saw whirring]
-Ugh.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.002
['90s music playing]

03:44.224 --> 03:45.225
Yes.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.186
My hero.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.898
Your pal at Vice finally got a hit
on our Utopium chemist.

03:51.981 --> 03:55.568
Found a reference to a "feenpole bub"
in an old arrest report.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.694
Gotta be Beanpole Bob.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.112
[Liv] Cool beans, Ravi.

03:58.696 --> 04:01.699
It's like I always say,
if you work hard and believe in yourself,

04:01.783 --> 04:02.909
you can accomplish anything.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.537
So the report was for a dealer
from Mr. Boss' crew

04:06.621 --> 04:10.917
busted a day after the boat party
with Utopium in his possession,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.294
possibly cooked by Beanpole himself.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.379
[Liv] That's great.

04:14.879 --> 04:18.258
I think drugs is one of the biggest issues
facing young people today.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.509
Or any people.

04:19.592 --> 04:22.178
That's true, albeit unrelated.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.807
The best part is
the dealer made bail, then vanished.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.851
Likely meaning Mr. Boss had him murdered.

04:28.977 --> 04:29.936
Oh.

04:30.019 --> 04:34.440
Well, murder is almost always bad,
but... I don't know.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.361
Brilliant. It means the case is still open

04:38.444 --> 04:41.197
and the Utopium, perhaps tainted Utopium

04:41.281 --> 04:42.907
needed to produce a cure,

04:42.991 --> 04:45.326
has been in the evidence room
the entire time.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.828
Oh, then dopes.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.121
Snaps for Ravi.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.999
So what is this?
She eat the cast of <i>Clueless</i> or something?

04:51.082 --> 04:53.918
Nineties teen pageant girl brain.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.005
Gnarly.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.465
Uh, that was more '80s.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.466
Whatever.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.927
The cure awaits. To the evidence room.

05:08.725 --> 05:09.809
Where is the evidence room?

05:12.895 --> 05:15.690
So, case number 334585?

05:16.357 --> 05:18.943
334585. Come here, you sexy thing.

05:20.111 --> 05:20.945
You sign for it?

05:21.029 --> 05:21.863
Just signed.

05:21.946 --> 05:22.780
Got your ID?

05:22.864 --> 05:24.073
You have a copy right here.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.159
They're sticklers for this stuff.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.203
You don't like it, change the incentives.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.835
There's nothing in there.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.504
Yeah, that was Sergeant Paul.

05:38.880 --> 05:39.797
Not a stickler.

05:39.881 --> 05:40.798
Now fired.

05:40.882 --> 05:41.758
See how it works?

05:42.759 --> 05:43.843
Who checked this out last?

05:45.094 --> 05:46.471
Sergeant Henry Mosher.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.056
Yep. Four years ago.

05:48.139 --> 05:48.973
Mosher.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.641
That tone doesn't sound good.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.561
A bad cop. Was pretty much in the pocket
of the Blue Cobras.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.521
I investigated his murder myself.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.191
We thought the Cobras had him killed,
but couldn't prove it.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.735
So, any evidence he took
likely vanished along with him.

06:00.818 --> 06:01.652
Anyone's guess.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.572
Now, who'd probably know is A.J.,

06:04.655 --> 06:05.740
head of the Blue Cobras,

06:05.823 --> 06:09.327

former Deputy DA Peyton Charles.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.454
-[knocking on door]
-[Liv] Martin.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.332
Hello? Just checking in.

06:15.833 --> 06:16.751
I brought brain broth,

06:16.834 --> 06:19.837
and even more importantly,
according to medical professionals,

06:20.171 --> 06:22.006
my emotional support through this.

06:23.716 --> 06:24.842
Martin, are you okay?

06:28.846 --> 06:29.680
Martin?

06:32.475 --> 06:33.518
Oh, my God.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.783
I wasn't aware that the head of
Fillmore Graves made house calls.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.243
Thanks.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.369
No sweat.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.162
Liv's done the same for me.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.373
If we could get him to my house,
I can look after him.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.084
God, my head.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.043
Hang in there.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.420
I'll pack a bag for him.

07:02.004 --> 07:02.839
Yeah.

07:18.312 --> 07:19.272
Open up.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.357
I need to fix my makeup.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.316
Open up.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.531
[gasps]

07:29.907 --> 07:32.368
Wassup? Clive, it's me again.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.037
I have got to give you
the 411 on my vision.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.957
This case has, like, totally changed.
Okay, call me back.

07:38.749 --> 07:39.709
143.

07:46.757 --> 07:47.592
[all gasp]

07:49.927 --> 07:53.431
[Laurie-Beth] <i>I dream of one day attending</i>
<i>the Juilliard School of Drama.</i>

07:53.514 --> 07:55.349
<i>Everything's coming up Velma.</i>

07:55.766 --> 07:58.561
<i>...and hard work,</i>
<i>you can accomplish anything.</i>

07:58.644 --> 08:00.188
You go, girl.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.230
[Clive] What's this?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.733
You said you had a vision,
not a vision board.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.193
[Liv] Okay, get this.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.904
In my vision,
Laurie-Beth was totally freaking.

08:07.987 --> 08:11.199
She needed to fix her makeup
but her dressing room was locked.

08:11.449 --> 08:15.119
So she went to Velma's room
and grabbed this poisoned face powder.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.120
Velma's room?

08:17.288 --> 08:19.332
So, what,
you think Velma was the intended target?

08:19.415 --> 08:20.833
Well, I mapped out a timeline.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.794
The song "Camptown Races" was playing
during Carly's ribbon dance.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.463
That was the song in my vision

08:25.546 --> 08:27.340
when Laurie-Beth was locked out
of her dressing room.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.717
Thirty minutes later,
she collapsed onstage.

08:30.092 --> 08:33.304
So, now we know when Laurie-Beth
put on Velma's makeup.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.890
And once we get the raw footage
of the whole pageant,

08:35.973 --> 08:40.019
hopefully, I can figure out
when someone spiked it. And booya!

08:40.102 --> 08:41.521
How much sugar have you had?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.688
Lots.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.191
We've gotta tell Velma the good news.
She's totally innocent.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.276
Cool your jets, kid. Velma's still our--

08:47.360 --> 08:48.194
[Alex] Knock-knock.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.573
Someone asked us to drop these tapes off.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.116
Oh, yes, that was me.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.457
You must be Laurie-Beth's parents.

So nice to meet you.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.795
I'm Alex Spano, my wife Gayle.

09:05.878 --> 09:06.712
Hello.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.508
Thanks for bringing the footage by.
It's gonna be super-helpful.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.885
I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:12.969 --> 09:13.803
Thank you.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.555
You shot this video yourself?

09:16.055 --> 09:18.683
Former pageant girl.
You couldn't keep her away.

09:19.183 --> 09:22.144
I was behind the camera
the whole time for Miss Future Seattle.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.396
I remember everything.

09:23.479 --> 09:24.564
[Alex] It's okay, honey.

09:28.025 --> 09:31.153
Anything else we can do to help,
you let us know.

09:33.114 --> 09:36.784
[exhales] You must be swamped at
the office, you didn't have to join.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.327
No, babe, I had free time,

09:38.411 --> 09:41.122
and me and A.J. go way back,
so I figured I'd help.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.375
A.J. and I have crossed paths before,

09:44.458 --> 09:48.337
and I'm a veteran
law enforcement professional.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.423
-I don't need my hand held, yeah?
-Yeah.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.634
He'll be cuffed though, right?
They're cuffed?

09:54.844 --> 09:55.678
[door opens]

09:59.765 --> 10:00.725
Counselor.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.685
Long time no see.

10:07.648 --> 10:08.608
Who's this guy?

10:12.903 --> 10:17.199
Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti,
Chief Medical Examiner.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.245
Why? I'm alive.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.833
He wants to ask you some questions.
Strictly off the record.

10:29.503 --> 10:30.671
Is this necessary?

10:31.839 --> 10:33.007
Just ask him.

10:36.260 --> 10:39.847
[clears throat]
So, in 2014, Sergeant Henry Mosher

10:39.930 --> 10:42.433
stole a dozen vials of Utopium
from an evidence box,

10:42.516 --> 10:47.897
and word on the street, as it were,
is you were the one who ordered it.

10:48.439 --> 10:49.273
Maybe.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.817
Maybe "no" or maybe "yes"?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.445
Okay, come on,
we know Mosher was on your payroll.

10:55.404 --> 10:56.697
I said off the record.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.078
And I'll look into getting you a TV
in your cell.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.664
So, what, like, 52-inch?

11:04.747 --> 11:05.581
Twenty.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.501
Okay. Yeah, Mosher took the stuff.

11:08.584 --> 11:11.921
Utopium was the hot new thing.
Mr. Boss' guys had it, we didn't.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.799
When I heard one of Boss' corner boys
got busted with the stuff,

11:14.882 --> 11:15.925
I saw an opportunity.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.594
So you had Mosher take the evidence
from the station.

11:18.677 --> 11:21.472
We copy their recipe,
take care of their hotshot cook

11:21.555 --> 11:23.265
and take over the game in one move.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.893
"Take care," as in murder him?

11:25.976 --> 11:28.396
Did I say murder? I didn't say--

11:28.479 --> 11:30.606
Off the record.
And I'll get you up to 28-inch.

11:30.689 --> 11:35.820
Yeah, as in murder. My boys rang his bell,
blasted him on his doorstep.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.530
Beanbag Bill or whatever.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.407
Great plan...

11:40.282 --> 11:41.867
till we got boned on the Utopium.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.078
So Mosher never delivered?

11:44.161 --> 11:44.995
He did.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.664
But the vials were filled with water.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.750
Someone must have got to it first.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.133
Hi, Sloat.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.301
We were hoping to see
who the second-to-last person

11:59.385 --> 12:02.471
to check out case 334585 was.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.807
Sure, Ms. Acting Mayor.
I'll have that for you in a jiff.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.726
Well, look who's suddenly Peppy McGee.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.186
Big fan of the show, Mayor.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.605
Wife and I binged the whole shebang.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.940
I'm such an Ed.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.652
That's great. Thanks for watching.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.737
I cured zombie-ism. No biggie.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.907
Looks like that evidence
was signed out by a

12:21.991 --> 12:24.702
Dr. Barkley Schexnayder
from Pecanole Labs.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.162
Here's his ID.

12:29.248 --> 12:32.126
-[Peyton] Is that Don E?
-[Ravi] Are you kidding me?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.341
[Liv] I think you're innocent, Velma.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.678
And I've always believed
that what makes America great

12:42.761 --> 12:46.891
is that we are a nation of laws,
and you are innocent until proven guilty.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.184
I used to believe that, too,

12:48.267 --> 12:51.103
until I got railroaded
into signing a false confession

12:51.187 --> 12:53.230
'cause I didn't have the money
for a decent lawyer.

12:53.939 --> 12:57.568
Okay, but another thing
that makes America great is that...

12:58.319 --> 12:59.653
Well, what we're doing now.

13:00.946 --> 13:04.492
Velma, is there anyone
who might have wanted to sabotage you?

13:05.367 --> 13:09.330
Oh, at Miss Olympia,
Elise Falcon put oil on my tap shoes.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.081
I ate it pretty hard onstage.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.000
Elise Falcon, the witness who claimed

13:13.083 --> 13:15.419
you complained about Laurie-Beth
and the scholarship stuff?

13:15.628 --> 13:18.047
Maybe she was doing that
to keep the scent off of herself.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.424
[Velma] No. No, I said that stuff.

13:21.175 --> 13:24.386
It was just me and my mom
on a chicken farm.

13:24.929 --> 13:28.390
I wanted to go to Juilliard,
be an actress, go on Broadway.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.475
Broadway.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.520
Can you do that thing
where you cry on cue?

13:32.603 --> 13:34.563
What did any of that
have to do with Laurie-Beth?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.566
'Cause she was so perfect.

13:38.484 --> 13:42.112
Smart, talented,
rich parents, perfect life.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.533
For me, that scholarship was my only hope.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.035
So, yeah, I bitched to Elise about it.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.204
But not like I would ever do anything.

13:53.123 --> 13:55.000
[crying]
I might have dreamed of being an actress

13:55.084 --> 13:57.294
and going to Broadway, but now...

13:58.003 --> 14:01.131
All I want is just to get back to the farm
and my chickens.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.676
Velma, you will.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.137
I swear, we are going to work so hard.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.808
Shut up. That's amazing.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.309
Clive. Right?

14:13.269 --> 14:14.520
Yeah, it was impressive.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.107
[Don E] Oh, God, Sloane Mills.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.442
Should have left her in that trunk.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.152
Why are you even showing me that?

14:22.236 --> 14:23.362
We been trying to find her.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.198
She posted this the other night
on her Instagram,

14:26.740 --> 14:27.950
and I just noticed this.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.080
When did you change the sign?

14:33.581 --> 14:34.748
Two or three weeks ago.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.418
Around when she dropped off the radar.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.087
You have security cameras?

14:40.546 --> 14:41.797
It was reggae night.

14:41.881 --> 14:46.510
I remember because she kept yelling,
"Jamaican me horny..."

14:46.594 --> 14:48.137
-[Don E and Darcy laughing]
-...while she and her boyfriend

14:48.220 --> 14:50.431
flirted with some hipster zombie girl.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.683
Heavy pre-three-way vibe.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.560
Wonder if that should be
on the bucket list?

14:58.147 --> 14:58.981
Can we focus here?

15:00.441 --> 15:01.984
[Don E] Boom! There's Sloane.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.069
Happy?

15:06.447 --> 15:07.698
Looks like they left together.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.408
[Darcy] Does that look like a wig?

15:09.783 --> 15:11.869
Why would a zombie wear a zombie wig?

15:12.661 --> 15:13.495
Hold on.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.749
When those Dead Enders guys
were scaring away the clientele,

15:17.458 --> 15:19.960
we installed
some infrared cameras outside.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.670
It's alive.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.591
Why the hell would a human pick up
two drunk zombies at a nightclub?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.553
You think Sloane got kidnapped again?

15:30.387 --> 15:34.183
I mean once, shame on us. But twice?

15:34.516 --> 15:37.227
You think it was the Dead Enders?
We could help you find her.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.145
Not a good idea.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.022
Just send me that footage.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.692
I mean it. Stay out of it.

15:45.945 --> 15:46.779
Fine.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.285
But I bet it'll be fun.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.455
-You're so hot.
-[giggles]

15:57.331 --> 15:58.666
[Laurie-Beth playing flute on video]

16:03.087 --> 16:04.421
-[audience applauding]
-[host] <i>Laurie-Beth Spano.</i>

16:04.588 --> 16:06.173
[Liv] So, this is interesting.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.385
Velma took the lead after Laurie-Beth
screwed up her flute solo.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.803
I tallied up the scores.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.597
And guess who was tied for second place
with Laurie-Beth?

16:14.056 --> 16:16.100
Elise. Ironic, right?

16:17.309 --> 16:19.395
Well, I think
you're using ironic wrong but--

16:19.478 --> 16:20.896
I think I'm using it right.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.440
Define ironic.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.318
Well, you know, just ironic.

16:27.861 --> 16:28.904
Agree to disagree.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.157
But that second place thing
does speak to motive.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.368
[Elise] <i>...and as a singer-songwriter,</i>

16:34.451 --> 16:39.289
<i>I hope to use my voice and lyrics</i>
<i>to inspire women across the world.</i>

16:39.748 --> 16:40.708
<i>Girl power!</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:42.126
[audience cheering]

16:42.209 --> 16:43.836
My name is Elise Falcon.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.631
You've probably seen my billboards,
"Made to Rest LLC."

16:47.715 --> 16:50.926
I specialize in real estate
for zombie clientele.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.054
I think you spelled realty wrong.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.306
Oh, no. That says reality star.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.892
I'm actually working on a deal
with U-Freight-Eze

16:58.976 --> 17:01.103
to get my zombie house-flipping show
on their network.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.813
It's in preliminary stages.

17:02.896 --> 17:03.731
Good luck with that.

17:04.064 --> 17:08.360
I wanted to ask you about an incident
at Miss Olympia back in 1997.

17:08.444 --> 17:12.114
Velma Charlet claims
you applied a lubricant to her tap shoes,

17:12.197 --> 17:13.490
causing her to fall onstage.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.575
Okay, I did.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.286
What's that have to do
with Velma killing Laurie-Beth?

17:17.369 --> 17:20.664
We think Velma's innocent,
so we're working really hard--

17:20.748 --> 17:23.125
Laurie-Beth apparently used
Velma's makeup.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.669
We're exploring the possibility
she was the target.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.589
You think I messed with Velma's makeup?
No way.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.258
You did just admit
to sabotaging her tap shoes.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.803
Exactly.
Why would I do something like that again?

17:34.887 --> 17:39.141
Any idea why Laurie-Beth
would be locked out of her dressing room?

17:39.224 --> 17:40.225
There was a rumor

17:40.309 --> 17:43.395
that Megan Sowinski was sleeping
with the pageant director, Jake.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.064
Megan Sowinski?

17:45.773 --> 17:48.734
Played "Respect" on the autoharp.
Wanted to be a vet.

17:48.817 --> 17:49.651
Yep.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.737
They might've been in there
for a little... [clicks tongue]

17:51.820 --> 17:52.946
-You know.
-Ew!

17:53.030 --> 17:55.032
Well, that's what Velma said
when she caught them.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.158
When the rumor spread,

17:56.241 --> 17:58.368
Megan was pissed at Velma
for blabbing about it.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.995
Velma told people about the affair?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.371
Well, that's what Megan thought.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.123
I was the one who blabbed, actually.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.709
[chuckles] Oops. Mmm-hmm.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.795
So if Megan
was in that locked dressing room

18:07.878 --> 18:11.256
when Laurie-Beth used Velma's makeup,
she could have dosed it right before.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.134
The real tragedy here

18:14.218 --> 18:17.554
is that I totally would have won
if all this drama didn't go down.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.390
I'd have had a show on the air,
like, forever ago.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.435
Anything is possible.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.438
[rock music playing]

18:30.901 --> 18:33.320
Hi, excuse me, I'm looking for Don...

18:33.862 --> 18:35.531
Sorry. I didn't realize

18:35.614 --> 18:37.991
you were in the middle of a production of
<i>On the Waterfront.</i>

18:38.659 --> 18:41.578
Yeah, and if I catch any zombies
on the waterfront,

18:41.662 --> 18:43.622
I'll kick their asses into the surf, bro.

18:43.997 --> 18:45.082
Right.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.209
I'm going undercover.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.378
I sound like a Dead Ender?

18:50.504 --> 18:51.338
Sure.

18:51.713 --> 18:56.176
I'm looking for that great man of science,
Dr. Schexnayder.

18:56.885 --> 18:57.803
That ain't me.

18:57.886 --> 18:58.971
Who is it, then?

18:59.555 --> 19:02.933
I'd never wear such a dumb disguise.
That's my twin brother, Scott E.

19:04.685 --> 19:05.811
Look at the droopy ear.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.064
These guys sit at full attention, bro.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.193
So Scott E took the Utopium
from the evidence room?

19:13.610 --> 19:14.778
Mr. Boss' orders?

19:14.862 --> 19:17.990
I assume. He was pretty messed up
after the boat party.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.659
He was high all the time,
he was living in my mom's basement.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.202
Till he checked into a loony bin.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.624
[sighs] Liv said to make sure you eat.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.711
Hope you like chicken noodle gloop.

19:31.587 --> 19:32.921
-[chuckles]
-Okay.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.884
My daughter seems to have a lot of friends
in high places.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.846
A private military commander,
and the mayor herself.

19:40.929 --> 19:42.181
Mmm. Acting mayor.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.308
And it's not the most glamorous gig,
trust me.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.934
Oh, case in point.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.395
<i>Dust off those family recipes</i>
<i>and bake what your mama gave ya,</i>

19:48.478 --> 19:50.147
<i>'cause this Friday, it's Pie Day.</i>

<i>Here to tell us more is Mayor Charles.</i>

19:52.399 --> 19:55.569
<i>It's Seattle's annual Piesta</i>
<i>this weekend in Seward Park.</i>

<i>We're whipping up something</i>
<i>quite delicious.</i>

19:57.696 --> 20:00.324
-[sighs]
-Can't be an easy gig,

20:01.283 --> 20:04.536
with the whole
zombies versus humans thing.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.163
Oh, I mean, it's a challenge.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.664
[Liv] 'Sup, Peynizzle?

20:09.374 --> 20:11.418
Thanks for taking the dinner shift.

I am super-buggin'.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.798
But we're gonna crack it, I can feel it.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.926
This look is fly.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.844
Aw, purple means I'm happy.

20:21.345 --> 20:23.013
How's our patient? You look better.

20:23.513 --> 20:24.556
Oh, better than I feel.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.643
But you're doing the work
and staying focused on a better tomorrow.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.269
Just like our acting mayor here.

20:29.978 --> 20:32.439
See? We made it work.
I think this city can, too.

20:32.940 --> 20:38.779
I mean, it doesn't hurt that I live
with the best zombie of them all.

20:38.862 --> 20:39.863
[both chuckle]

20:42.783 --> 20:43.951
Don't freak out.

20:44.034 --> 20:46.703
Not a good start. It's 3:00 a.m., Don E.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.873
I know you told me and Darcy
not to go after Sloane's kidnapper.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.626
But we did and we found her.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.170
But then she sees us
tailing her out of Warmbloods,

20:55.796 --> 20:56.838
and she takes off,

20:56.922 --> 20:58.423
and we chased her onto a roof.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.676
And then she pulls this move,

21:01.635 --> 21:03.387
just like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson,

21:04.137 --> 21:08.225
and she jumps to the next building.

21:09.977 --> 21:10.936
She got away?

21:11.395 --> 21:14.439
Maybe it wasn't just like Dwayne Johnson.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.282
Five stories down.

21:24.324 --> 21:25.284
Sorry.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.875
I told you to stay out of it.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.669
But we got her.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.672
Can't you just CSI her or something?

21:38.755 --> 21:41.717
Did you get anything out of her
before you chased her to her death?

21:41.800 --> 21:43.844
We yelled stop. She said no.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.220
Did you check for ID?

21:47.848 --> 21:49.057
You're pretty good at this.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.023
[Don E] So, what now?

21:56.773 --> 21:57.816
[Major] <i>Kristen Cox.</i>

21:59.568 --> 22:02.070
We ID'd her on security cam
kidnapping Sloane Mills.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.907
We searched her apartment,
found tape, rope, but no Sloane.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.200
If we don't find her,

22:07.284 --> 22:09.286
there's nothing keeping
her father, General Mills,

22:09.369 --> 22:11.204
from trying to wipe Seattle
clean off the map.

22:11.288 --> 22:14.499
So hopefully, one of us will have a vision
that can lead to Sloane.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.834
And fast.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.337
Dig in.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.215
[knocking on door]

22:24.092 --> 22:24.926
Mom?

22:25.010 --> 22:27.679
Sorry to just show up like this,
but you wouldn't answer my calls.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.056
Now is not really a good time.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.766
[Evan coughing]

22:33.894 --> 22:34.728
Evan.

22:35.562 --> 22:36.980
-You look...
-I think I'm gonna yak.

22:39.816 --> 22:40.942
[Eva] <i>Burn scar carcinoma.</i>

22:41.693 --> 22:43.653
The scars from the Meat Cute explosion?

22:45.530 --> 22:47.449
It's spreading to his lymph nodes.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.995
We tried skin grafts, chemo, nothing.

22:52.621 --> 22:55.165
Our last resort is an
experimental treatment

22:55.248 --> 22:56.625
at a facility in Boston.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.002
I need you to get us out of the city.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.546
Have you tried the Fillmore Graves
emergency exit program?

23:01.630 --> 23:02.589
We didn't make the cut.

23:02.672 --> 23:05.759
Trust me, if I could do this without you,
I would.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.260
So, can you do it?

23:07.344 --> 23:08.845
I don't just snap my fingers.

23:10.305 --> 23:13.642
Every time my coyotes go out,
it's lives in danger.

23:15.018 --> 23:15.977
[sighs]

23:16.812 --> 23:18.730
It's not the only way.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.108
I scratch people all the time.

23:21.191 --> 23:24.736
No. Evan deserves a normal life,
I'm not turning him into--

23:24.820 --> 23:25.737
[Martin] A zombie?

23:26.446 --> 23:27.697
What's wrong with that?

23:28.031 --> 23:29.533
Your daughter turned out okay.

23:31.159 --> 23:32.119
Martin?

23:35.622 --> 23:36.498
What are you...

23:38.416 --> 23:39.626
You contacted him?

23:39.709 --> 23:41.711
After everything I told you?

23:41.795 --> 23:43.255
Yes. And he needed my help, so--

23:43.338 --> 23:45.549
She's helping get me clean, Eva.

23:47.217 --> 23:48.093
I see.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.971
So, the only family you're concerned about

23:51.054 --> 23:53.431
is a stranger
who's never been in your life.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.100
At least I know whose side you're on.

23:55.183 --> 23:56.226
I'm not on a side.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.895
I'm in the middle
trying to hold everyone together.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.524
I helped Martin for the same reason
that I'm going to help Evan.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.360
Because I want everyone to get along

24:05.443 --> 24:07.362
and just for the people in my life
to be happy.

24:07.654 --> 24:08.488
Okay?

24:09.865 --> 24:11.491
So, you will help us then?

24:16.955 --> 24:18.081
Who the hell is this guy?

24:18.498 --> 24:19.833
And what's with his rug?

24:19.916 --> 24:22.878
Evan, this is Martin Roberts, our father.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.552
I think I'm going to be sick again.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.179
Just one scratch, son.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.098
And you won't be suffering anymore.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.308
But he won't be Evan, so--

24:36.391 --> 24:39.394
All due respect, you haven't earned
the fatherly advice thing yet.

24:41.479 --> 24:44.858
Mom, just take Evan home, okay?
I'll call my people in the morning.

24:49.863 --> 24:50.864
[Eva] Thank you, Liv.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.034
And you're right.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.161
We should try to get along.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.425
[stairs creaking]

25:10.508 --> 25:13.220
I'm just saying those shoes
aren't exactly ideal for sneaking.

25:14.554 --> 25:16.806
Look. Do you want my help or not?

25:16.890 --> 25:19.226
You shouldn't even be out this late,
you've got work and...

25:19.517 --> 25:20.644
Don't worry about me.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.854
Let's do this breaking and entering.

25:23.480 --> 25:27.859
So, Scott E checked in to the asylum
pretty soon after he stole the evidence,

25:27.943 --> 25:31.071
so there's a good chance
it's still here at... Oh!

25:31.696 --> 25:33.448
That is a tasteful mid-century lamp.

25:33.907 --> 25:34.741
[Peyton sighs]

25:36.451 --> 25:39.537
-You've been on junkie brain.
-Mmm-hmm.

25:40.997 --> 25:43.083
Where does one hide drug paraphernalia?

25:43.250 --> 25:46.336
Uh, nooks, holes, things of that nature.

25:48.338 --> 25:50.340
Or a hollowed-out book, à la <i>Shawshank.</i>

25:52.968 --> 25:54.052
Encyclopedias.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.012
Try the letter "U."

26:02.727 --> 26:04.020
[both gasp]

26:04.354 --> 26:07.482
You guys really suck at this.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.326
What the hell are you doing here?

26:19.035 --> 26:21.454
Is that any way to speak to a man
in his own home?

26:21.705 --> 26:23.456
And my, what a home it is.

26:24.374 --> 26:27.627
I just heard you compliment my lamp.
No takesies-backsies.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.879
So what's the deal here?
[clears throat]

26:30.714 --> 26:33.883
Kinky cop-and-robber role-play--

26:33.967 --> 26:35.343
We're following up on a case.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.928
We think, back in the day,
Scott E might have hid

26:37.012 --> 26:40.140
a stolen box of evidence here
that we need. So...

26:40.223 --> 26:43.852
Uh-huh. So they put their best
corpse doctor and their ex-DA on the case.

26:43.935 --> 26:44.853
That's brilliant.

26:44.936 --> 26:46.980
Can we take a look around or not?

26:47.063 --> 26:49.149
I don't know, what's in it for me?

26:49.232 --> 26:50.358
[Peyton scoffs]

26:51.067 --> 26:52.527
The Blaine DeBeers catchphrase.

26:52.610 --> 26:56.781
For instance, when I was arrested,
they impounded my lovely automobiles.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.992
-[dryly] Aww.
-I don't know, I'm just spitballing here,

26:59.075 --> 27:02.579
but it feels like
the acting mayor of Seattle could,

27:03.288 --> 27:04.456
you know, pull a few strings.

27:04.789 --> 27:07.876
We do not bargain with kid-murdering,
cure-thieving, pieces of--

27:07.959 --> 27:08.793
Done.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.004
Let's just get this over with.

27:15.800 --> 27:16.801
[Blaine] Oh!

27:16.885 --> 27:18.094
You know what'd also be rad?

27:18.386 --> 27:20.096
One of those handicapped parking placards.

27:20.847 --> 27:21.681
Yeah.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.475
That would really come in handy.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.061
Fine, I'll take care of it.

27:27.062 --> 27:29.147
You know,
I always like doing business with you.

27:31.232 --> 27:35.862
In spite of, you know... everything.

27:37.614 --> 27:38.448
Come on.

27:58.301 --> 27:59.344
They're all empty.

28:00.261 --> 28:02.305
Well, this was a fun play date, gang.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.433
Drop by again sometime, huh?

28:05.517 --> 28:07.519
Your ex is such a pig.

28:07.602 --> 28:09.938
You def traded up, Rav is the bomb.

28:10.021 --> 28:13.858
Like part Prinze Jr., part Van Der Beek
but with a beard.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.652
[knocking]

28:15.735 --> 28:17.237
Oh, Peyton, I gotta go. Love you. Bye-Bye.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.031
How are you feeling?

28:20.240 --> 28:22.450
Actually, better than I have in years.

28:23.326 --> 28:25.829
Like, really clear-headed.

28:27.664 --> 28:32.210
And probably well enough
where I can go back home soon, I'm afraid.

28:32.293 --> 28:33.837
Well, good.

28:35.505 --> 28:37.173
Orange is mixed emotions.

28:38.341 --> 28:41.010
Yeah, circumstances
could have been better,

28:41.094 --> 28:42.762
but it's been nice being here.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.598
You're a real credit to us zombies.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.809
The world is full of all kinds of people.

28:48.184 --> 28:50.353
I just want to make it a better place
for all of them.

28:50.812 --> 28:55.817
I mean, that's basically how I feel
even if it comes out sounding a bit corny.

28:55.900 --> 28:58.528
No, no, no, no, it's nice.

28:59.362 --> 29:01.614
I know you and your friends
are doing what you can.

29:03.158 --> 29:08.705
But I worry sometimes
that humans might never come around on us.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.415
Dad, it'll be fine.

29:14.335 --> 29:15.879
Oh, my God. I said it.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.175
[Martin laughs]

29:21.926 --> 29:25.847
You are just the best daughter
that I could imagine, Liv.

29:26.347 --> 29:27.265
Truly.

29:30.810 --> 29:34.355
I want you to promise me,
that if the time should ever come

29:35.899 --> 29:38.735
where you and I
might have to choose sides...

29:41.613 --> 29:43.114
That you'll let me take care of you.

29:44.407 --> 29:47.869
That's why we try our best
so that day will never come.

29:47.952 --> 29:49.037
I hope you're right.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.544
Kristen's late.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.587
Forget her.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.589
Let's get this show on the road

29:59.672 --> 30:01.508
before they report the truck missing.
Come on.

30:06.095 --> 30:07.138
[engine starting]

30:08.807 --> 30:12.227
I had a wonderful dream
that we found the tainted Utopium,

30:12.310 --> 30:15.939
and saved the galaxy, and got medals.

30:16.523 --> 30:20.527
But then I woke up,
and the Utopium's gone,

30:21.986 --> 30:23.571
and we're at a dead end.

30:24.531 --> 30:25.615
Not necessarily.

30:25.698 --> 30:28.368
A.J. told us the Cobras
took care of Beanpole Bob

30:28.451 --> 30:30.161
on the night they tried to get
that Utopium evidence.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.623
Took care of, as in, gun-murdered him
on his own doorstep.

30:33.706 --> 30:35.875
I looked at the dates
for reports of shots fired.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.669
Only one incident that night.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.172
The responding officers
showed up at the address

30:41.256 --> 30:42.340
and everything was fine.

30:43.007 --> 30:43.842
No body--

30:43.925 --> 30:44.968
So no murder.

30:45.051 --> 30:48.137
If Beanpole Bob were a zombie,
he'd have survived the hit.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.223
If he used the tainted Utopium--

30:50.306 --> 30:52.767
We could get his address
and pay Beanpole Bob a little visit.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.230
I love you.

30:57.313 --> 30:59.899
I was ready to throw in the towel
but you kept fighting.

30:59.983 --> 31:03.027
You're a badass superwoman
saving the day over and over.

31:03.778 --> 31:05.905
Seattle will have no fear,
Mayor Charles is here.

31:06.781 --> 31:07.782
Actually...

31:10.159 --> 31:11.160
I'm not anymore.

31:13.705 --> 31:14.581
I got fired.

31:16.666 --> 31:17.500
Wait, what?

31:17.584 --> 31:20.211
Ravi, I sold the naming rights
to the Space Needle to fund a show.

31:21.087 --> 31:23.923
We knew it was just a matter of time
before the city council caught on.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.261
I officially resigned today.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.680
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

31:30.763 --> 31:32.390
I was having too much fun with you.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.227
Team Pavi, you know?

31:37.478 --> 31:38.563
That's got a good ring.

31:38.980 --> 31:39.814
Wait.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.109
If you're no longer mayor,
everything you promised Blaine--

31:43.192 --> 31:44.611
Oh, yeah, he's not getting any of that.

31:45.528 --> 31:48.740
Okay, I really love you.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.159
[both laughing]

31:53.328 --> 31:55.246
Commander, we got something.

31:55.330 --> 31:56.164
A vision?

31:56.247 --> 31:58.166
Ames saw it. Looked like Eastlake Marina.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.501
Unknown male saying something
about ditching it here.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.545
Eastlake Marina, let's go.

32:05.423 --> 32:06.549
[footsteps approaching]

32:07.133 --> 32:09.135
So I tracked down Megan Sowinski.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.596
Moved to Louisiana ten years ago.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.514
And is she a veterinarian?

32:13.598 --> 32:15.850
Taking care
of little alligators and turtles?

32:15.975 --> 32:16.935
No.

32:17.393 --> 32:19.562
She is a Louisiana state
correctional officer

32:19.646 --> 32:23.691
on disability following a human bite
sustained during a prison riot.

32:24.859 --> 32:26.235
She said she wanted to be a vet.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.279
I wanted to be a test pilot.

32:28.363 --> 32:29.322
And you can be.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.367
If you work hard and believe in yourself,
there's nothing you can't--

32:32.450 --> 32:35.662
Do you want to hear what I got,
or make another one of these speeches?

32:36.537 --> 32:37.372
What you got.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.208
So, Megan did admit
she was in Laurie-Beth's dressing room

32:40.291 --> 32:42.835
with the pageant director, Jake,
who confirms this.

32:42.961 --> 32:43.795
Grodie.

32:43.878 --> 32:46.714
But she also remembers sharing
Velma's makeup with her

32:46.798 --> 32:48.341
after the swimsuit competition.

32:48.424 --> 32:49.717
Whoa, did she have a reaction?

32:49.801 --> 32:50.760
She says she felt fine.

32:51.344 --> 32:54.305
So, if the face powder
was fine after swimsuits,

32:55.139 --> 32:58.434
but it was spiked
by the time of Carly's ribbon dance,

32:58.851 --> 33:01.145
Velma's makeup had to have been spiked
somewhere in here.

33:02.438 --> 33:05.274
We can check the footage to see
who was accounted for during that time.

33:05.358 --> 33:08.319
I'm pretty sure all the girls were,
except, of course, for Megan, but...

33:08.736 --> 33:10.113
[host] <i>...and in the same way.</i>

33:10.613 --> 33:11.656
Wait a second.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.866
<i>...next up, Elise Falcon.</i>

33:16.035 --> 33:17.412
<i>They're wonderful, aren't they?</i>

33:17.662 --> 33:18.621
That guy creeps me out.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.665
<i>Each girl just wonderful in their own way.</i>

33:21.207 --> 33:22.375
<i>And in the same way.</i>

33:23.001 --> 33:24.627
Not him. Her.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.005
Laurie-Beth's mom.

33:27.255 --> 33:28.089
Gayle.

33:28.631 --> 33:30.550
She said she was filming the whole time.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.343
She lied.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.096
Oh, snap. And right during
the window of opportunity.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.307
What if Gayle saw
Laurie-Beth was losing and got desperate?

33:38.641 --> 33:40.893
Desperate enough to sabotage the one girl

33:40.977 --> 33:43.896
threatening her daughter's
chance of winning, Velma.

33:44.439 --> 33:45.273
[sighs]

33:46.024 --> 33:48.109
U-G-L-Y, Gayle ain't got no alibi.

33:48.192 --> 33:49.694
The evidence is right there, isn't it?

33:50.236 --> 33:53.489
I'm not sure.
If we could only get a confession.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.835
So, we're discussing charges
with Velma's lawyer.

34:05.918 --> 34:08.963
A question of manslaughter
versus second-degree murder at this point.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.882
We just need to clear up a few details.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.801
I'm just happy to be here
to watch Velma go down.

34:14.677 --> 34:18.431
We only need Gayle present,
since she shot the footage.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.017
Sure, but I should be with her.

34:21.642 --> 34:23.436
It's fine. Really.

34:38.868 --> 34:43.414
So, if you could note any instances
where Velma's story doesn't match up,

34:43.498 --> 34:44.749
it would help us out a lot.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.629
[Clive] The evidence points to you, Velma.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.174
So, we're just going to
walk through this, step by step.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.676
You know, your victim's mother
shot this footage?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.428
I told you, I'm innocent.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.180
[Laurie-Beth playing flute on video]

34:59.263 --> 35:01.390
[Clive] <i>So, at this point,</i>
<i>Laurie-Beth was in the lead.</i>

35:01.599 --> 35:05.019
<i>And the only way you could win</i>
<i>was to put the rose hips in her makeup.</i>

35:05.353 --> 35:07.522
<i>A big rash on her face</i>
<i>before the formal wear.</i>

35:09.273 --> 35:10.733
[sobbing] <i>I didn't do it.</i>

35:11.359 --> 35:12.944
<i>And she messed up her solo.</i>

35:13.027 --> 35:16.114
<i>She wasn't even in the lead after that.</i>
<i>I swear, I didn't do it.</i>

35:16.197 --> 35:18.199
[Clive] <i>That's not what you said</i>
<i>in your earlier statement.</i>

35:18.282 --> 35:21.661
[Velma] <i>They forced me to take the deal.</i>
<i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

35:22.662 --> 35:25.581
<i>Why do you want to ruin my life</i>
<i>for something I didn't do?</i>

35:25.706 --> 35:27.208
<i>When did you tamper with the makeup?</i>

35:27.291 --> 35:29.127
<i>It had to have happened around this time</i>

35:29.210 --> 35:31.254
<i>and I don't know who else</i>
<i>had the opportunity.</i>

35:31.337 --> 35:32.171
[Velma crying]

35:33.464 --> 35:34.882
[Gayle crying]

35:37.260 --> 35:38.678
It's okay to cry.

35:39.345 --> 35:40.930
Let it out, girl.

35:42.890 --> 35:44.809
It was just one mistake.

35:48.354 --> 35:51.941
She played her flute solo perfectly
every time in practice.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.485
She should have won, no problem.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.951
I just wanted to give Velma a rash.

36:03.035 --> 36:05.371
Laurie-Beth deserved to win, but...

36:08.166 --> 36:13.004
Oh, God. I've lived with this
all these years. I can't...

36:16.215 --> 36:17.842
[Gayle sobbing]

36:26.893 --> 36:29.228
Got it. That was an amazing performance.

36:29.604 --> 36:30.646
It's a shame.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.690
You really would have been
a super-great actress.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.109
Thanks.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.111
But I'm a great organic farmer,

36:37.195 --> 36:39.071
and that's cool, too.

36:39.822 --> 36:41.073
[Laurie-Beth] <i>I believe in truth,</i>

36:41.657 --> 36:43.993

36:44.994 --> 36:47.997
<i>And as a lawyer,</i>
<i>I will spend my life teaching law-breakers</i>

36:48.122 --> 36:50.249
<i>that crime doesn't pay.</i>

36:51.000 --> 36:52.835
[audience applauding]

36:53.794 --> 36:55.922
Apples, peaches and pears. Oh, my!

36:56.047 --> 36:58.257
Piesta is officially underway.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.509
That's right. It's a fiesta of pie.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.929
We have vendors from all over the city

37:03.012 --> 37:06.140
who've come to share a piece
of Seattle's tastiest tradition.

37:06.349 --> 37:08.059
It seems that everyone out here

37:08.142 --> 37:11.979
is hungry for a little taste
of sweet, sweet victory.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.439
Okay.

37:13.522 --> 37:14.815
Did you ditch the truck?

37:15.983 --> 37:17.318
Then we're all set.

37:24.116 --> 37:27.370
Stan'll get you on a bus
and on your way to Boston safe and sound.

37:31.707 --> 37:32.959
Be strong, okay?

37:33.626 --> 37:34.752
You'll make it through this.

37:34.835 --> 37:35.670
Yeah.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.507
Hey, I never told you before, but...

37:40.716 --> 37:42.802
-You really rock this look.
-[chuckles]

37:46.389 --> 37:47.473
Your father...

37:47.556 --> 37:48.599
Mom, not this again.

37:49.475 --> 37:50.601
What you're doing for him...

37:52.353 --> 37:53.562
it's kind of you.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.449
Thank you for your help.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.493
Give me a call when you make it.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.371
I promise I'll pick up this time.

[Romeros snarling]

38:54.040 --> 38:56.125
Berths are all in use, no sign of Sloane.

38:56.208 --> 38:59.170
Dustin's Port-A-Potties reported
this truck missing today at 10:00 a.m.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.255
What the hell?

39:01.797 --> 39:03.466
Who steals a Port-a-Potty truck?

39:03.799 --> 39:04.800
[woman screams]

39:04.884 --> 39:06.093
Grab the rifles.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.737
Oh, my God. This is... This is just awful.

[snarls]

39:59.271 --> 40:01.482
Hey, I brought ramen.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.207
They need me at the morgue.

40:18.666 --> 40:19.708
Go.

40:21.293 --> 40:22.378
I'm sorry, Liv.

40:26.507 --> 40:28.092
I just got called in to work.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.261
We're here, though.

40:30.719 --> 40:31.971
Do we come back later?

40:33.347 --> 40:37.351
The chief cook of Mr. Boss'
Utopium empire lives right there.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.395
Think about it.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.440
Utopium first appeared here in Seattle.

40:43.190 --> 40:45.234
This might be the guy who invented it.

40:45.317 --> 40:46.902
And if this Beanpole Bob

40:46.986 --> 40:50.072
is the guy who made
the batch of tainted Utopium,

40:50.156 --> 40:51.907
then he very well might be

40:53.117 --> 40:56.287
the father of all zombie-kind.

40:59.081 --> 41:00.249
Then, since we're here...

41:02.209 --> 41:04.128
Hey, wait. Look.

41:07.089 --> 41:07.923
What?

41:14.346 --> 41:16.056
The father of all zombie-kind...

41:16.182 --> 41:17.516
Is Liv's dad.
