00:11.619 --> 00:13.280
2

01:08.395 --> 01:10.097
Housekeeping.

02:38.165 --> 02:40.066
I'm out.

02:42.129 --> 02:44.951
That's the gig.
You got it?
Man 2: Yes, sir.

02:45.051 --> 02:46.593
Mr. Legrand--
Natalie, what's the matter?

02:46.692 --> 02:48.035
Is he back?
No, no, no, no.

02:48.135 --> 02:50.677
I'm fine.
I was, uh...

02:50.777 --> 02:52.759
He's not it.
I was, uh, cleaning the room,

02:52.858 --> 02:54.861
the high roller room.

02:58.745 --> 03:01.327
No, I know,
but you have to stop him.

03:01.428 --> 03:03.410
Everything's going
to be alright.

03:08.954 --> 03:10.337
Hi, Cliff, he's still
in there with some--

03:10.436 --> 03:11.738
It's alright, Ginger.

03:11.838 --> 03:13.220
Ginger, would you
please get Natalie

03:13.320 --> 03:15.742
some water or maybe
something stronger.

03:15.841 --> 03:17.784
Just water.

03:17.884 --> 03:20.245
It's Cliff.
We have a code red.

03:22.888 --> 03:24.891
Cliff, what's up?

03:33.138 --> 03:35.141
I don't believe it.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.084
It was in
the president's suite.

03:38.184 --> 03:39.926
No, I believe,

03:40.025 --> 03:42.028
I believe you.
It's just...

03:44.269 --> 03:46.493
It's the Caine suite.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.094
Are you
100 percent certain?

03:48.194 --> 03:50.096
Room 1848.

03:50.196 --> 03:52.197
I know who Mr. Caine is.

03:52.719 --> 03:54.019
I know this is
a big deal.

03:54.120 --> 03:57.382
Natalie, it doesn't
matter who he is

03:57.483 --> 03:59.865
or what, how much
money he's got,

03:59.965 --> 04:01.968
what he means
to this casino.

04:02.327 --> 04:04.329
This is...

04:04.970 --> 04:07.673
beyond just
moral revulsion.

04:07.774 --> 04:09.875
This is illegal.

04:09.976 --> 04:12.077
You did the right thing.

04:12.178 --> 04:16.282
Now we're going to do
what we need to do. Okay?

04:16.382 --> 04:18.243
Uh, I have to--
I left my cart in the hallway.

04:18.344 --> 04:19.606
Leave it.
Don't worry about it.

04:19.705 --> 04:21.127
I'll have to
at least check out--

04:21.227 --> 04:23.610
Don't clock out.
We'll handle all of it, alright?

04:23.710 --> 04:25.091
You've been
through enough tonight.

04:25.191 --> 04:28.014
We're going to have
to contact the FBI,

04:28.114 --> 04:30.897
I think, probably have
to give a statement.

04:30.997 --> 04:32.998
I don't know how it works.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.042
But we'll be there
for you.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.404
Is your husband home?

04:39.045 --> 04:41.387
Yeah. He is.

04:41.486 --> 04:44.229
You feel safe
going home to him?

04:44.330 --> 04:46.332
He's fine. Yeah.

04:46.652 --> 04:48.654
Alright, well...

04:49.094 --> 04:51.117
get changed.

04:51.217 --> 04:53.219
Go straight home.

04:53.859 --> 04:56.202
We don't want Caine getting
wind that something is up

04:56.301 --> 04:59.685
and running off
before the FBI can get here.

04:59.784 --> 05:03.409
So for tonight, just don't tell
anyone about this, okay?

05:03.509 --> 05:05.510
Yeah.

05:06.111 --> 05:08.114
You're doing
the right thing.

05:25.051 --> 05:26.512
Should we call
your father?

05:26.611 --> 05:28.554
No, we're not calling
my fuckin' father.

05:28.654 --> 05:30.656
I'm handling this.

05:31.817 --> 05:33.819
I can handle it.

05:35.181 --> 05:37.183
Then tell me what to do.

06:02.608 --> 06:04.610
Chief.
Good night, Ben.

06:13.659 --> 06:15.661
Hey, Nat.

06:43.849 --> 06:45.711
We ain't voting.

06:53.258 --> 06:55.380
Goddamn it.
I said we ain't voting!

08:00.645 --> 08:02.647
Jerry.

08:40.365 --> 08:42.367
Okay. It's done.

08:52.737 --> 08:54.739
You alright?
Yeah.

08:57.782 --> 08:59.784
Where were we?

09:23.688 --> 09:25.690
Yeah. God.

09:39.343 --> 09:41.405
Oh. What's good, John-O?

09:41.505 --> 09:43.207
John-O:
Yo, yo, yo.

09:43.307 --> 09:46.410
Wanna help me eBay
some old Playboys?

09:46.510 --> 09:49.614
I'll cut you in.
They're mint.

09:49.714 --> 09:51.295
Ah, John-O.
Nah, man.

09:51.395 --> 09:53.618
I, I got to go
to work in a few.

09:53.718 --> 09:54.899
Work?

09:54.999 --> 09:55.980
They're mint.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.622
Mint-arino.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.745
Hey. John-O, where did
you get those?

10:00.845 --> 10:02.386
No more break-ins, okay.

10:02.486 --> 10:04.068
I don't want to have
to bail your ass out again.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.710
John-O:
None of that, no.

10:05.810 --> 10:07.952
John-O's good-O.

10:08.052 --> 10:10.514
Bitty's in the kitty,
shit's in the litter,

10:10.614 --> 10:13.437
and the world is
a beautiful place.

10:14.819 --> 10:16.200
Okay, man.

10:21.946 --> 10:23.447
Goddamn.

10:23.547 --> 10:24.769
Ah, geez.

10:28.232 --> 10:30.234
Hey. Uh, did you leave yet?

10:33.117 --> 10:35.599
You hear about
this child porn ring thing?

10:36.240 --> 10:37.421
What?

10:37.521 --> 10:39.503
Yeah, they had it
on my news.

10:39.603 --> 10:43.467
Kiddie porn, dark web,
like all the worst shit.

10:43.567 --> 10:45.309
These rich fucks
have these rings.

10:45.409 --> 10:47.431
It's all run out of Russia
on the dark web.

10:47.531 --> 10:48.913
Oh, my God.

10:49.013 --> 10:51.755
Charlie, I'm not having
a good morning.

10:51.855 --> 10:53.317
I don't need this
right now.

10:53.417 --> 10:54.999
Why do you listen
to that stuff?

10:55.099 --> 10:57.281
Why do I listen
to the news?

10:57.381 --> 10:58.923
Yeah, what's the point?

10:59.023 --> 11:01.405
You can't do anything
about it.

11:01.505 --> 11:02.766
Every day, you're mad
about something

11:02.866 --> 11:04.288
you can't do
anything about.

11:04.388 --> 11:05.929
We're just better off
with music, don't you think?

11:06.029 --> 11:08.052
I'm doing something
about it right now.

11:08.152 --> 11:09.573
Look, I don't care.

11:09.673 --> 11:11.335
Come at me,
you Russian pervos.

11:11.435 --> 11:13.637
Time's up
on that shit. Done.

11:16.079 --> 11:19.023
So. Handled.

11:30.334 --> 11:31.955
How you doing?
You alright?

11:32.055 --> 11:33.076
Yes, I'm good.

11:33.176 --> 11:35.199
Oh, bullshit.
What?

11:35.299 --> 11:37.120
What? I hear bullshit,
I say bullshit.

11:37.220 --> 11:38.662
It's a thing I have, you know.
Empty your pockets.

11:38.662 --> 11:41.004
So you're not good.
So what's up?

11:41.104 --> 11:43.567
Nothing.
Uh-huh.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.809
Can we just, maybe,
just, can we not?

11:45.909 --> 11:48.972
I'm fine.
Well, bullshit, but alright.

11:49.072 --> 11:51.215
Come back through.
Man, it's these things
setting it off.

11:51.315 --> 11:53.316
You're wearing a pound
of chrome on your face?

11:55.439 --> 11:57.381
Son of a bitch.

11:57.481 --> 11:59.303
Natalie.

12:00.924 --> 12:02.546
Charlie.
Son of a bitch.

12:02.646 --> 12:05.709
Okay, you got me.
You got me.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.351
I'm gonna break his face.

12:07.451 --> 12:08.812
I still don't get it.
You looked at his phone?

12:08.812 --> 12:10.914
No, I didn't even.
He's such an idiot.

12:11.014 --> 12:12.876
I was knitting on the couch.
The Apple TV was on

12:12.976 --> 12:15.439
with that screensaver
where it puts up our photos.

12:15.539 --> 12:17.601
So it's like my sister's kids
and our Tahoe shots

12:17.701 --> 12:18.962
when we went last month.

12:19.062 --> 12:20.404
And then it's his dick.

12:20.504 --> 12:22.846
Like, boom,
his dick is on the TV.

12:22.946 --> 12:24.448
He didn't even know
because it's, what is it

12:24.548 --> 12:25.729
with the photos
on his phone?

12:25.829 --> 12:27.050
The cloud.
The cloud.

12:27.150 --> 12:28.452
The cloud of boners.

12:28.552 --> 12:30.013
So when he gets home,
I'm like,

12:30.113 --> 12:31.655
who the fuck are you
sending your dick to?

12:31.755 --> 12:33.336
And he plays dumb
and then...

12:33.436 --> 12:34.858
That's as good
as I can get it.

12:34.958 --> 12:36.960
Thank you, Chelle.

12:39.482 --> 12:41.184
Nat.

12:41.284 --> 12:43.466
Please tell me that
you kicked his ass out.

12:43.566 --> 12:45.709
Yeah, I did.

12:45.809 --> 12:47.811
Bullshit.

12:49.292 --> 12:51.474
Hey, you guys
doing okay over here?

12:51.574 --> 12:52.836
Hi, how's it going?

12:52.936 --> 12:54.037
This is you, right?
Thank you.

12:54.137 --> 12:55.879
A little scotch
on the rocks.

12:55.979 --> 12:58.882
Oh, tiger stripes
and tie-dye.

12:58.982 --> 13:00.724
Alright, place your bets,
place your bets.

13:02.145 --> 13:03.606
Uh, uh, where's it
gonna land?

13:03.706 --> 13:05.708
Nobody knows.

13:11.795 --> 13:13.256
Hey, Chuck. Yeah.

13:13.356 --> 13:15.338
Before you go,
the big guy wants to see you.

13:15.438 --> 13:17.440
Uh, big guy who?

13:19.562 --> 13:21.564
Oh, shit.

13:26.569 --> 13:28.351
Two tables.

13:28.451 --> 13:30.453
Alright. What else
does he need for the meeting?

13:31.574 --> 13:33.196
And coffee? Alright.

13:33.296 --> 13:35.158
Alright. Thanks.
I'll make sure he gets it.

13:35.258 --> 13:36.559
Hmm.

13:36.659 --> 13:38.661
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

13:41.144 --> 13:43.506
Charlie Cale,
I'm here to get fired.

13:48.471 --> 13:50.133
Hello, Miss Cale.

13:50.233 --> 13:52.235
I'm happy
to finally meet you.

13:53.436 --> 13:55.478
Yeah, well, alright.

13:59.322 --> 14:01.324
Have a seat.

14:04.487 --> 14:06.489
Something to drink?

14:06.809 --> 14:09.332
Uh... no.

14:10.253 --> 14:12.255
Uh, like what?

14:13.015 --> 14:15.017
Anything.

14:16.219 --> 14:18.221
No.

14:18.821 --> 14:20.323
So I, I think
I know what this is,

14:20.423 --> 14:23.045
and you should just do it.

14:23.145 --> 14:24.487
What do you think this is?

14:24.587 --> 14:25.968
Well, your dad gave you
this casino,

14:26.068 --> 14:27.850
what, uh,
three months ago?

14:27.950 --> 14:31.494
He didn't give it to me.
I manage it.

14:31.594 --> 14:34.577
Alright. And I think
maybe there was

14:34.677 --> 14:37.500
a lot to do with the handover
and the paperwork and stuff.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.262
And so, for whatever reason,

14:39.362 --> 14:41.404
he just got around
to telling you about me now.

14:42.124 --> 14:43.666
Yes, he did.

14:43.766 --> 14:45.868
So...

14:45.968 --> 14:48.551
now that you know
about my whole thing,

14:48.651 --> 14:50.072
you're going to fire me,

14:50.172 --> 14:51.634
'cause it's probably
the smart thing to do.

14:51.734 --> 14:54.637
And I never understood
why he kept me around.

14:54.737 --> 14:56.959
I think he liked you.

14:57.059 --> 14:59.041
Ah. He did not.

14:59.141 --> 15:01.323
Uh, I don't know what version
of the story you got.

15:01.423 --> 15:03.425
Let's start there then.

15:04.386 --> 15:07.450
Once upon a time
in Denver,

15:07.550 --> 15:10.252
milquetoast collection
of the best poker players

15:10.352 --> 15:12.054
in central Colorado

15:12.154 --> 15:15.938
met at a Fairfield Inn
suite off I-25.

15:16.038 --> 15:18.981
Well, not a barn burner,
just a run-of-the-mill

15:19.081 --> 15:22.064
Thursday night
mid-stakes ring game.

15:22.164 --> 15:25.548
A young woman from
out of town was at the table.

15:25.648 --> 15:28.751
She was cute.
She livened up the room.

15:28.851 --> 15:31.573
She had plenty of cash
so they let her play.

15:33.776 --> 15:35.237
Three hours later,
she mopped the floor

15:35.337 --> 15:37.339
with each
and every one of them,

15:37.820 --> 15:39.642
which happens.

15:39.742 --> 15:42.124
But this had been happening.

15:42.224 --> 15:44.086
Previous week, in Cheyenne.

15:44.186 --> 15:46.488
Week before, in Rapid City.

15:46.588 --> 15:49.531
Same young woman
cutting a haphazard path

15:49.631 --> 15:51.854
across the middle
of the country.

15:51.954 --> 15:53.856
Never in any big games,

15:53.956 --> 15:56.098
never in
corporate-owned casinos,

15:56.198 --> 15:58.200
but always
the same result.

15:58.841 --> 16:00.843
She didn't lose.

16:02.925 --> 16:04.747
Word spread quick.

16:04.847 --> 16:07.249
'Cause as you know,
gamblers talk.

16:08.130 --> 16:10.132
But here's the thing.

16:10.893 --> 16:12.895
As far as anyone could tell,

16:13.815 --> 16:15.677
she was playing straight.

16:15.777 --> 16:19.041
No wires, no shills,

16:19.141 --> 16:21.203
and yet she played

16:21.303 --> 16:25.727
with an almost
supernatural infallibility.

16:25.827 --> 16:28.710
Like she was seeing
through the cards.

16:30.312 --> 16:32.634
So when she
showed up here,

16:33.515 --> 16:35.517
snuck into a tournament,

16:36.198 --> 16:38.200
my dad was interested.

16:39.921 --> 16:41.923
And he watched her.

16:43.845 --> 16:45.667
Secretly.

16:45.767 --> 16:48.230
Watched her play
for two days,

16:48.330 --> 16:50.072
sat in the crow's nest

16:50.172 --> 16:52.234
ten hours
a day himself.

16:52.334 --> 16:54.336
He studied her.

16:55.177 --> 16:57.899
And my dad figured out
what she was doing.

16:59.941 --> 17:02.143
Even when he figured it out,
he couldn't believe it.

17:03.265 --> 17:05.267
It was impossible.

17:06.228 --> 17:08.230
It was insane.

17:08.670 --> 17:11.393
But there was
no other explanation.

17:14.676 --> 17:16.678
So...

17:17.439 --> 17:19.441
so it's true.

17:23.565 --> 17:25.567
That's...

17:28.129 --> 17:30.712
That's--
Bar's still open?

17:30.812 --> 17:32.554
You haven't gambled since.

17:34.295 --> 17:36.358
Really haven't?
Well...

17:36.458 --> 17:40.322
your dad put the word out
that I played dirty.

17:40.422 --> 17:42.604
You said it yourself,
gamblers talk.

17:42.704 --> 17:44.005
To this day,

17:44.105 --> 17:45.887
no podunk penny game
in this country

17:45.987 --> 17:47.128
will take my buy-in.

17:47.228 --> 17:49.230
I'm blackballed.

17:51.553 --> 17:54.416
But, uh, well,
he didn't break my fingers.

17:54.516 --> 17:56.217
And you know how scared I was
when he had me brought

17:56.317 --> 17:57.819
into that back room.

17:57.919 --> 18:00.001
Your dad can be
a scary guy.

18:02.163 --> 18:03.344
I know.

18:03.444 --> 18:04.706
He called me, kid.
He said,

18:04.806 --> 18:06.588
"This is a real mess, kid."

18:06.688 --> 18:08.550
And then
he gave me a job,

18:08.650 --> 18:10.912
let me work here.

18:11.012 --> 18:13.434
So maybe he does like me.

18:13.534 --> 18:15.396
He gave you a job
to keep you in a cage.

18:17.578 --> 18:20.281
You seem awfully blasé
about this.

18:20.381 --> 18:22.644
You've got this gift.

18:22.744 --> 18:25.266
And my dad made sure
you'd never use it again.

18:27.789 --> 18:29.791
Aren't you pissed?

18:30.391 --> 18:31.813
Well, Sterling,

18:31.913 --> 18:33.975
no, I'm not pissed.

18:34.075 --> 18:36.818
And to hear you tell this story,
I was the Cincinnati Kid,

18:36.918 --> 18:39.300
methodically fleecing
my way across the country

18:39.400 --> 18:42.023
until my master plan
was thwarted.

18:42.123 --> 18:44.786
Dude, I was a dumbass.

18:44.886 --> 18:47.909
I, I, uh,
I had no grand plan,

18:48.009 --> 18:50.952
no map with yarn
or anything.

18:51.052 --> 18:52.994
I figured out I could do
this thing, and it worked.

18:53.094 --> 18:54.635
So I did it for a while.

18:54.735 --> 18:56.477
I had money for dumb shit.

18:56.577 --> 18:58.519
I stayed at some nice hotels,

18:58.619 --> 19:00.481
but it was kind of boring.

19:00.581 --> 19:02.863
I figured it wouldn't last,
and it didn't.

19:03.744 --> 19:05.446
So...

19:05.546 --> 19:07.688
And now you know what?

19:07.788 --> 19:09.330
I'm doing fine.

19:09.430 --> 19:11.292
I, I like my life.

19:11.392 --> 19:12.894
I like my job.

19:12.994 --> 19:14.655
I'm bummed
that you're firing me.

19:14.755 --> 19:17.178
But I'll find another job.

19:17.278 --> 19:20.261
And I'll probably
like that one, too.

19:20.361 --> 19:22.023
I'm still pretty much
a dumbass,

19:22.123 --> 19:24.965
and I'm doing just fine.

19:26.487 --> 19:28.389
I'm holding
an ace of spades.

19:28.489 --> 19:30.491
Bullshit.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.535
Six of hearts. Bullshit.

19:36.257 --> 19:38.259
Ten of spades.

19:43.464 --> 19:44.885
You're not reading the cards.

19:44.985 --> 19:46.487
How could I read the cards?

19:46.587 --> 19:48.589
You're reading me.

19:48.909 --> 19:50.171
It's not like
it's one thing,

19:50.271 --> 19:51.852
like my eye twitches
or something.

19:51.952 --> 19:53.894
Nah.
It's just a general...

19:53.994 --> 19:55.416
Yeah.
You can just tell.

19:55.516 --> 19:56.897
Just that
something is off.

19:56.997 --> 19:58.379
That's the best way
to describe it.

19:58.479 --> 20:01.302
I can just tell.
When anyone is lying?

20:01.402 --> 20:03.404
Hundred percent
of the time?

20:05.286 --> 20:06.787
I'm going
to touch my nose.

20:08.128 --> 20:09.630
No, it doesn't work
like that.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.192
I'm not a soothsayer.

20:11.292 --> 20:12.473
I can't predict
the future.

20:12.573 --> 20:14.515
There's nothing
mystical about it.

20:14.615 --> 20:17.698
Just if someone is
intentionally lying,
that's it.

20:20.501 --> 20:22.122
You're not firing me.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.224
Charlie.

20:25.305 --> 20:27.548
Charlie.

20:30.631 --> 20:33.113
How can you not see
that this is a...

20:34.034 --> 20:35.736
is a gift?

20:35.836 --> 20:38.218
You've been graced
with a gift.

20:38.318 --> 20:40.320
I'm happy you're enjoying
your dead-end life.

20:41.802 --> 20:43.804
But for you
to be a nobody,

20:44.605 --> 20:46.607
a cocktail waitress.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.269
For you to not use this,

20:49.369 --> 20:50.751
it's criminal.

20:50.851 --> 20:52.433
I'm not firing you.

20:52.533 --> 20:54.595
I'm giving you an opportunity
to work with me,

20:54.695 --> 20:56.697
to use your gift.

20:57.337 --> 20:59.780
To get very, very rich.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.764
I've been rich.

21:03.864 --> 21:05.365
Yeah, how was it?

21:05.465 --> 21:06.887
Easier than being broke,

21:06.987 --> 21:08.989
harder than doing just fine.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.815
With due respect,

21:14.915 --> 21:16.917
you've had money,
never been rich.

21:18.598 --> 21:21.702
I need to know you're in before
I tell you what I want to do.

21:21.802 --> 21:23.904
And I need your answer
before end of day tomorrow.

21:24.004 --> 21:26.086
It's time sensitive. Yeah.

21:31.011 --> 21:33.013
And if I say no, am I fired?

21:33.493 --> 21:34.715
Okay.

21:34.815 --> 21:37.157
Is Cliff...?
He's offsite.

21:37.257 --> 21:40.120
Alright, well,
get Cliff there.
He'll know.

21:40.220 --> 21:42.222
Okay. Mm-hmm. Bye.

21:43.823 --> 21:45.085
Sorry.

21:45.185 --> 21:46.686
Something up?
Nah.

21:46.786 --> 21:49.009
Some drunk
on the casino floor

21:49.109 --> 21:50.730
shoutin' for his wife.

21:50.830 --> 21:52.012
Cliff will handle it.

21:52.112 --> 21:54.114
So if I want to just, uh...

21:55.155 --> 21:56.857
Wait, who is he
shouting for?

21:56.957 --> 21:59.099
Natalie?

21:59.199 --> 22:01.301
Natalie!

22:01.401 --> 22:03.143
What the fuck
are you looking at?

22:03.243 --> 22:05.425
Natalie, where are you,
you dumb bitch?

22:05.525 --> 22:06.626
Shit.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.308
I'm looking
for my wife!

22:08.408 --> 22:09.950
Natalie.

22:10.050 --> 22:11.071
You know her,
you work with her.

22:11.171 --> 22:12.312
What's your name, huh?

22:12.412 --> 22:13.673
Natalie, baby,
come on out.

22:13.773 --> 22:15.755
Don't do this to me again.

22:15.855 --> 22:17.877
You know I hate coming up here.

22:17.977 --> 22:19.719
What are you looking at, huh?

22:19.819 --> 22:21.641
You guys making some money?
Nice fucking shirt, dude--

22:21.741 --> 22:24.044
Jerry. Hey.
Hey, you stupid asshole.

22:24.144 --> 22:26.166
Hey, man. It's me.
Charlie. Charlie.

22:26.266 --> 22:27.967
Listen, I know she's,
I just need to tell her--
She's not here.

22:28.067 --> 22:29.329
Jerry, she is not here.

22:29.429 --> 22:30.770
I would never hurt her.

22:30.870 --> 22:32.332
God, man.

22:32.432 --> 22:34.334
Oh, this is, this is
what we're doing, huh?

22:34.434 --> 22:36.456
Get the fuck--

22:36.556 --> 22:37.777
Get off of me!

22:37.877 --> 22:39.259
Cliff, he's got a gun.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.302
Fuck you.
Get off of me.

22:42.402 --> 22:43.823
I know my rights.

22:43.923 --> 22:45.425
Damn it!
Come on!

22:45.525 --> 22:48.508
I know my rights!
I'll kill you!

22:48.608 --> 22:50.710
You piece of shit!

22:50.810 --> 22:52.432
I'll fucking kill you!

22:52.532 --> 22:53.873
Get your fucking hands
off me!

22:53.973 --> 22:55.515
Hey. Hey.
They got him, alright.

22:55.615 --> 22:57.197
Cliff got him.
You're alright.

22:57.297 --> 22:58.598
He had been texting me
crazy shit all morning.

22:58.698 --> 22:59.759
I keep my phone off
on my shift.

22:59.859 --> 23:01.481
I didn't see it.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.323
I just...
I'm okay.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.044
I just,
I just need to breathe.

23:05.144 --> 23:06.766
Hey, hey, take the rest
of the day off.

23:06.866 --> 23:08.127
You got somewhere
safe to go?

23:08.227 --> 23:09.289
Yeah. She's staying
with me tonight.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.291
No.
You're staying with me.

23:15.435 --> 23:17.437
<i>What is a miracle, Vincent?</i>

23:18.678 --> 23:20.019
<i>Act of God.</i>

23:20.119 --> 23:22.121
<i>And what's
an act of God?</i>

23:22.842 --> 23:25.104
God.

23:25.204 --> 23:27.467
It is crazy the things
that people stick

23:27.567 --> 23:29.389
up their asses.

23:29.489 --> 23:31.491
Yeah.

23:31.891 --> 23:33.633
What are you reading?

23:33.733 --> 23:35.154
"Ten craziest things

23:35.254 --> 23:37.256
people have stuck
up their asses."

23:39.739 --> 23:41.741
Jerry is going
to be home tonight.

23:43.262 --> 23:46.045
He's going to be there,
and he'll be sorry and sweet.

23:46.145 --> 23:48.147
And he'll get sober...

23:48.988 --> 23:50.570
for a while.

23:50.670 --> 23:52.251
Get a restraining order.

23:52.351 --> 23:53.733
It's his house.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.775
He owned it
before we got together.

23:55.875 --> 23:58.538
Get a divorce,
you get to keep the house.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.860
No.

24:00.960 --> 24:04.624
I signed this thing.
I don't know, I was so stupid.

24:04.724 --> 24:07.426
I can't afford to be out
on my ass right now.

24:07.526 --> 24:09.468
Maybe that's a dumb reason
for me to stay with Jerry,

24:09.568 --> 24:11.390
but it's the truth.

24:11.490 --> 24:13.352
With my mom and everything,
I can't afford it.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.454
You can just stay here.

24:16.175 --> 24:18.357
Man, it just...

24:18.457 --> 24:19.518
It pisses me off.

24:19.618 --> 24:20.920
I know.

24:21.020 --> 24:22.481
I think in another life,

24:22.581 --> 24:24.583
you were like a knight.

24:26.425 --> 24:28.427
Lady Galahad.

24:30.389 --> 24:31.931
<i>What do you mean
walk the earth?</i>

24:32.031 --> 24:34.033
<i>You know,
like Caine in "Kung Fu."</i>

24:47.886 --> 24:49.268
You know who that is?

24:49.368 --> 24:51.310
Uh, yeah,
it's Mr. Caine.

24:51.410 --> 24:54.033
Yeah, Kazimir Caine.
Oil guy. Right.

24:54.133 --> 24:55.794
You know why
you know who he is?

24:55.894 --> 24:57.156
Well, he's a high roller.

24:57.256 --> 24:58.357
Anything he asks for,

24:58.457 --> 24:59.598
we bump it
to the top of the ticket

24:59.698 --> 25:00.759
and tell the floor boss.

25:00.859 --> 25:02.401
Caine is a whale.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.003
He's one of four
or five whales

25:04.103 --> 25:05.324
we get in here
every year.

25:05.424 --> 25:07.246
We, we fly them in,

25:07.346 --> 25:09.808
they drop what islands cost
in a weekend.

25:09.908 --> 25:12.211
To them, it's a drip
in the bucket.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.213
They're whales.

25:14.313 --> 25:17.196
But Caine is
our Moby Dick.

25:18.797 --> 25:20.539
When my dad handed me
the keys to this place,

25:20.639 --> 25:22.020
he told me three things.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.543
He said,
keep the carpets clean,

25:24.643 --> 25:26.665
keep Caine happy.

25:26.765 --> 25:28.267
What was the third thing?

25:28.367 --> 25:29.468
It doesn't matter.

25:29.568 --> 25:31.570
Right now,
he's raising big.

25:31.890 --> 25:33.892
Is he bluffing?

25:36.735 --> 25:38.737
No.

25:41.219 --> 25:43.221
Well played, Mr. Caine.

25:52.911 --> 25:54.933
Yeah, my dad goes back
with this guy,

25:55.033 --> 25:57.155
so he doesn't scrutinise
his spending.

25:57.876 --> 25:59.418
I scrutinise.

25:59.518 --> 26:02.461
Past few years, he's spent less
and less at our tables.

26:02.561 --> 26:06.345
Turns out he's doing private
pick-up games in our suite.

26:06.445 --> 26:08.547
We fly him,
his whole crew out.

26:08.647 --> 26:09.948
We comp everything.

26:10.048 --> 26:11.470
We do this,

26:11.570 --> 26:12.831
and this cheap
son of a bitch is running

26:12.931 --> 26:14.933
his own game
on our property.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.155
So here's the proposition.

26:17.255 --> 26:19.758
We're going to fleece
this son of a bitch.

26:19.858 --> 26:21.720
You and me.

26:21.820 --> 26:24.082
Alright,
so let me get this straight.

26:24.182 --> 26:26.685
You get me
in his private game,

26:26.785 --> 26:27.966
and I take him.

26:28.066 --> 26:30.128
We both make
a ton of dough.

26:30.228 --> 26:31.970
He gets his hand slapped.

26:32.070 --> 26:35.473
Thinks maybe private games
are not such good luck for him.

26:36.354 --> 26:37.496
Sticks to the tables.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.057
Not you, though.
It's too risky.

26:39.157 --> 26:40.258
He's seen you
on the floor.

26:40.358 --> 26:41.780
Got to work
a camera system,

26:41.880 --> 26:43.261
get a shill
in the game.

26:43.361 --> 26:45.343
You signal him. Hm?
We'll figure it out.

26:45.443 --> 26:47.265
Can you do your thing
over video?

26:47.365 --> 26:48.747
Yeah, I think so.

26:48.847 --> 26:50.268
And, and when is this game?

26:50.368 --> 26:53.151
Day after tomorrow.
We got 48 hours.

26:53.251 --> 26:55.313
Uh, and,
and your dad's alright

26:55.413 --> 26:57.836
with, uh, us plucking
his golden goose?

26:57.936 --> 26:58.917
My dad?

27:00.458 --> 27:02.580
Ah. I told them.
Hold on.

27:03.822 --> 27:06.604
Uh, has your dad
okayed this?

27:06.704 --> 27:09.207
It's my name
on the office door.

27:09.307 --> 27:11.249
Ginger, I told you.
I'm--

27:11.349 --> 27:14.132
Unless a 12-foot
"J" and "R"
are being shipped,

27:14.232 --> 27:15.653
it's still his name
on the casino.

27:15.753 --> 27:17.776
Uh, I don't care
if he's retired.

27:17.876 --> 27:19.337
If I piss off
your dad again,

27:19.437 --> 27:21.099
he'll break more
than just my fingers.

27:21.199 --> 27:24.702
Hey, um,
give me 20 minutes. Hmm?

27:24.802 --> 27:27.445
I'll meet you
in the crow's nest in 20.

27:28.806 --> 27:30.148
What, you got
to actually work?

27:30.248 --> 27:32.250
Here,
use the private elevator.

27:34.892 --> 27:36.594
Oh, la la.

27:36.694 --> 27:38.276
Is that a bar?

27:38.376 --> 27:40.378
Wow.

27:49.747 --> 27:51.749
Cliff, what's up?

28:19.777 --> 28:21.779
Shit.

28:23.981 --> 28:25.163
<i>This is Natalie.</i>

28:25.263 --> 28:26.724
<i>You know what to do.</i>

28:26.824 --> 28:28.526
Hey, Natalie.
I just saw that you called.

28:28.626 --> 28:29.887
I don't know
how I missed it.

28:29.987 --> 28:31.849
Uh, just call me back, alright?

28:31.949 --> 28:33.951
I'm here. Sorry.

28:38.796 --> 28:40.798
Hey.

28:41.839 --> 28:43.841
That was more
than 20. Sorry.

28:45.523 --> 28:48.125
So, uh, what's it like

28:49.326 --> 28:51.509
always knowing the truth?

28:51.609 --> 28:53.070
Ehh... yeah, no,

28:53.170 --> 28:56.273
I only know
if something is a lie.

28:56.373 --> 28:58.316
And outside of poker,

28:58.416 --> 29:00.478
less useful
than you'd think.

29:00.578 --> 29:03.881
'Cause everyone,
they lie constantly.

29:03.981 --> 29:06.404
It's like birds chirping,
people lying.

29:06.504 --> 29:07.845
Just once you tune
into it,

29:07.945 --> 29:10.247
it's fucking everywhere
all the time.

29:10.347 --> 29:12.970
And they usually don't lie to
cover up some deep, dark secret,

29:13.070 --> 29:16.013
but about the stupid,
meaningless shit, you know.

29:16.113 --> 29:17.535
So, the real trick
of it is

29:17.635 --> 29:19.657
to figure out why.

29:19.757 --> 29:21.018
Why someone is lying.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.802
Excuse me.

29:26.724 --> 29:28.726
<i>Okay. It's done.</i>

29:33.530 --> 29:35.532
You alright?
Yeah.

29:38.415 --> 29:40.417
Where were we?

29:41.378 --> 29:45.282
Uh, if I pull out of this,
would you have to kill me?

29:50.067 --> 29:52.069
You're worried about my dad?

29:52.830 --> 29:54.932
My dad gave me this job
because he trusts me.

29:55.032 --> 29:57.034
Bullshit.

29:57.514 --> 29:59.636
My dad gave me
this job because...

30:00.798 --> 30:02.800
he thinks I'm a fuck-up...

30:03.640 --> 30:05.702
and he's made
that clear to me

30:05.802 --> 30:07.825
and everyone here.

30:07.925 --> 30:09.466
To everyone working here,

30:09.566 --> 30:12.549
I'm the kid clomping around
in his dad's shoes.

30:12.649 --> 30:14.111
It's humiliating.

30:14.211 --> 30:16.453
You know, I've made mistakes.
I haven't, uh...

30:17.935 --> 30:19.396
If you Google me,
you know,

30:19.496 --> 30:23.280
I've had
bad situations previously.

30:23.380 --> 30:25.242
I can't live as a failure
in his shadow

30:25.342 --> 30:27.164
for the rest of my life.

30:27.264 --> 30:29.646
I swear to God,
I'd rather die.

30:29.746 --> 30:34.091
This is my last chance to prove
I'm not what he thinks I am.

30:34.191 --> 30:36.253
And he figures this place
just runs itself.

30:36.353 --> 30:38.495
There's not much I can do
to mess things up.

30:38.595 --> 30:40.837
But you're going
to prove him wrong, yeah?

30:42.239 --> 30:44.241
Ehh.

30:44.641 --> 30:48.225
No, I'm going to show him
that I can do things my way.

30:48.325 --> 30:52.229
One point five million.
Clean. Cash.

30:52.329 --> 30:54.711
No matter what our take is
on the night.

30:54.811 --> 30:58.115
No matter if it even works
or happens.

30:58.215 --> 30:59.876
And you can
disappear after,

30:59.976 --> 31:01.978
no further obligations.

31:02.339 --> 31:04.561
One point five million

31:04.661 --> 31:06.663
for saying yes right now.

31:10.146 --> 31:12.989
Alright, Sterls,
let's do it.

31:51.828 --> 31:53.490
Son of a bitch.

31:53.590 --> 31:55.572
Yeah, son of a bitch.

31:55.672 --> 31:58.775
I saw her leaving last night.
She looked upset.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.937
And it says it happened
when she got home.

32:01.037 --> 32:03.820
I'd just seen her.
Like, I just saw her.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.582
Did she say anything?
No.

32:05.682 --> 32:07.183
She saw me
but kept walking.

32:07.283 --> 32:09.485
Huh. That's...

32:10.246 --> 32:12.228
Huh.

32:12.328 --> 32:14.230
What time?
Like, just after 8:00.

32:14.330 --> 32:15.832
I'm usually off
before she is.

32:15.932 --> 32:17.313
It's weird.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.415
Her shift doesn't end
till later, right?

32:19.816 --> 32:21.818
Right.

32:25.141 --> 32:26.803
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.905
She told me her combo
once when she was sick.

32:57.493 --> 32:59.836
Yeah, I didn't realise
you two were close.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.959
I'm sorry.
Yeah, she, uh,

33:03.059 --> 33:05.641
she tried to call me
last night.

33:05.741 --> 33:07.683
I, I just don't know
when I could have missed it.

33:07.783 --> 33:10.146
It must have been
when we were together.

33:11.867 --> 33:13.489
She might have been asking
if she could stay with me.

33:13.589 --> 33:15.371
I, I, if I'd just picked up--
Hey.

33:15.471 --> 33:17.853
You can't go down
that path.

33:17.953 --> 33:19.535
Nobody knows
why she called you.

33:19.635 --> 33:20.937
She could have called you
for a lot of reasons.

33:21.037 --> 33:23.019
Yeah.
You can't blame yourself.

33:23.119 --> 33:25.681
That'll lead
nowhere good. Right?

33:27.323 --> 33:30.146
So this suite
is identical to Caine's,

33:30.246 --> 33:32.828
with the exception
of ceiling height.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.111
This is the table
they'll use for the game.

33:35.211 --> 33:36.432
It's big. It's heavy.

33:36.532 --> 33:38.274
So it's unlikely
he'll move it.

33:38.374 --> 33:40.756
And our informant told us
last time he sat with his back

33:40.856 --> 33:42.398
to the window
facing the room,

33:42.498 --> 33:44.480
which makes sense.

33:44.580 --> 33:46.682
It's good for us.

33:46.782 --> 33:48.564
That's why I was thinking
cameras in the couch.

33:48.664 --> 33:50.886
Why would she
go home early?

33:50.986 --> 33:51.967
Why would she what?

33:52.067 --> 33:53.809
Her shift ends at 9:00.

33:53.909 --> 33:56.292
I missed a call from her
just before 8:00.

33:56.392 --> 33:58.534
And Michelle saw her leaving
Just after 8:00.

33:58.634 --> 34:00.136
Maybe she got sick.

34:00.236 --> 34:01.377
She would have clocked out
if she was sick

34:01.477 --> 34:02.978
or even texted me.

34:03.078 --> 34:04.260
Wait, what?

34:04.360 --> 34:05.661
She didn't clock out?
Nope.

34:05.761 --> 34:08.183
Wait, you talked
to her manager?

34:08.283 --> 34:10.024
Louis, yeah.

34:10.125 --> 34:11.466
Why did you do that?

34:11.567 --> 34:13.709
Because I want to know
why she went home early,

34:13.808 --> 34:15.310
why she called me.

34:15.410 --> 34:18.274
I mean, something happened
just before eight o'clock.

34:18.374 --> 34:20.676
It was scary enough
that she called me for help

34:20.776 --> 34:22.997
and then basically ran.

34:23.098 --> 34:25.520
So what happened?

34:25.620 --> 34:27.602
Well, considering
she went straight home,

34:27.703 --> 34:30.645
the obvious answer is
her husband called her.

34:30.745 --> 34:32.567
You see,
that's what you'd assume.

34:32.667 --> 34:33.928
That's what everyone
is going to assume

34:34.029 --> 34:35.049
just reading
the news on here.

34:35.149 --> 34:36.451
But I knew Nat.

34:36.551 --> 34:38.252
So I know
that doesn't make sense.

34:38.352 --> 34:40.055
I know you think you have
a read on people,

34:40.154 --> 34:42.738
but that actually
makes perfect sense.

34:42.837 --> 34:46.301
Nat kept her phone off
during her shift.

34:46.401 --> 34:48.343
So whatever it was
that spooked her

34:48.442 --> 34:50.305
wasn't a call,
and it wasn't Jerry.

34:50.404 --> 34:51.906
It was something
that happened right here

34:52.006 --> 34:54.029
while she was working.

34:54.129 --> 34:56.131
What was it?

34:56.451 --> 35:00.596
Look, her husband was
an abusive lowlife.

35:00.696 --> 35:05.319
It's tragic and sad,
but it's not complicated.

35:05.419 --> 35:07.683
I'm sorry. I don't want
to be insensitive,

35:07.783 --> 35:11.326
but we're in the middle of
a very time-dependent operation.

35:11.426 --> 35:14.649
And until tomorrow night,
I need you focused.

35:14.750 --> 35:18.073
Uh, a camera
in the couch won't work.

35:19.274 --> 35:20.455
Why not?

35:20.555 --> 35:21.817
It's the clearest eyeline.

35:21.917 --> 35:23.779
Swapping out the couch
is clunky.

35:23.879 --> 35:25.259
It could get noticed.

35:25.359 --> 35:27.462
Plus, you're going
to need multiple eyelines.

35:27.562 --> 35:29.343
Multiple cameras?

35:29.444 --> 35:31.105
Yeah,
because you don't know

35:31.205 --> 35:32.667
where the other players
are going to be sitting,

35:32.768 --> 35:34.770
blocking your view.

35:35.450 --> 35:37.232
What do you think?

35:37.332 --> 35:39.334
Lamps.

35:42.256 --> 35:44.259
Yeah.

35:45.020 --> 35:46.480
Yeah.

35:46.580 --> 35:47.962
Yeah, I can get my guys
to put cameras

35:48.062 --> 35:50.245
in the bases
of these easy.

35:50.345 --> 35:51.807
That's good.

35:51.906 --> 35:53.908
Thinking about the angles.

35:54.308 --> 35:56.310
You're good at this. Hmm.

36:13.647 --> 36:15.649
What the fuck, man?

36:17.852 --> 36:19.995
I'm still not sure
I understand how I can help you.

36:20.095 --> 36:22.397
Alright, so she was
a friend of mine.

36:22.497 --> 36:24.198
Look, you can see here,

36:24.299 --> 36:25.960
she tried to call me
the night she died,

36:26.060 --> 36:28.363
and I don't know why.
And then I thought,

36:28.462 --> 36:29.763
her personal belongings.

36:29.864 --> 36:32.006
Personal belongings?
Her phone.

36:32.105 --> 36:35.370
If I could just see her phone,
then maybe she,

36:35.470 --> 36:37.292
she called someone else
or texted someone else,

36:37.392 --> 36:39.053
or maybe she sent an email
or something that would just--

36:39.154 --> 36:40.654
Yeah, I can't
help you with that.

36:40.754 --> 36:42.417
But it's here, right?

36:42.517 --> 36:44.959
In the thing with the cage,
with the bars.

36:46.241 --> 36:47.982
In jail? Why would
her phone be in jail?

36:48.082 --> 36:49.544
Th-there's smaller bars.
Little bars.

36:49.644 --> 36:51.145
I'm not, uh...
What's the word?

36:51.245 --> 36:52.267
Little jail?

36:52.366 --> 36:53.667
No. Where you,
where you, um--

36:53.768 --> 36:55.830
Like, we built
a little jail for her phone?

36:55.930 --> 36:57.272
Where you lock up
the evidence,

36:57.372 --> 36:59.194
the, uh, locker,
the evidence locker.

36:59.294 --> 37:02.477
Jesus!
You know why it's
in the evidence locker?

37:02.576 --> 37:04.578
Because it's evidence.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.402
Go ahead.

37:07.502 --> 37:09.504
Oh, uh, may I?

37:10.745 --> 37:12.807
Once the coroner's
determination is official,

37:12.906 --> 37:14.207
it's all sent
to the next of kin,

37:14.308 --> 37:15.730
probably her mom.

37:15.830 --> 37:17.491
I know it's different on TV,
but when you're a cop,

37:17.591 --> 37:19.334
you don't just toss
evidence around.

37:19.433 --> 37:21.435
Hey.

37:24.598 --> 37:27.662
Look, working this county,
I see this more than I'd like.

37:27.761 --> 37:30.024
Domestic abuse escalating
into something like this,

37:30.124 --> 37:32.306
it's usually the result
of a pattern.

37:32.406 --> 37:35.308
You were not responsible
for that pattern.

37:35.408 --> 37:38.312
It, it, it isn't that.

37:38.412 --> 37:39.993
Look, Jerry was
a son of a bitch,

37:40.093 --> 37:42.316
but there's
something off here.

37:42.415 --> 37:43.598
There's, there's a lie.

37:43.698 --> 37:46.120
I just,
I need to find it.

37:46.220 --> 37:48.002
The investigation
isn't closed yet.

37:48.102 --> 37:50.924
I'll check with the coroner.
I'll go over everything again.

37:51.024 --> 37:53.326
And if you can think
of anything specific

37:53.426 --> 37:55.428
that can help, call me.

37:55.990 --> 37:58.852
I promise, you give me
something I can use,

37:58.953 --> 38:00.453
I'll use it.

38:00.553 --> 38:02.136
But do me a favour,

38:02.236 --> 38:03.337
trust us to do our job.

38:03.437 --> 38:05.439
You're not a cop.

38:24.538 --> 38:26.040
Yeah?

38:26.140 --> 38:27.480
<i>It's Sterling.</i>

38:27.580 --> 38:29.843
Yeah. How, how are
the lamps coming?

38:29.944 --> 38:32.086
<i>Good.
We should be able
to do a test in the morning.</i>

38:32.185 --> 38:34.207
<i>Hey, did you talk
to the police
about Natalie's death?</i>

38:34.308 --> 38:35.368
Yeah.

38:35.468 --> 38:37.131
<i>Sheriff Parker called me.</i>

38:37.230 --> 38:38.772
<i>He says he's going to do
a whole new round</i>

38:38.872 --> 38:40.214
<i>of questioning,
like the whole thing.</i>

38:40.314 --> 38:42.897
Oh, good.
<i>No, not good.</i>

38:42.997 --> 38:45.019
<i>Charlie, we talked
about this.</i>

38:45.118 --> 38:46.901
<i>You know what we're in
the middle of here tomorrow?</i>

38:47.000 --> 38:48.341
Well, yeah, but...

38:48.442 --> 38:51.024
Okay, so listen to this.

38:51.125 --> 38:54.067
The gun was
in Jerry's right hand

38:54.167 --> 38:55.589
when they found him, okay.

38:55.689 --> 38:57.270
His, his right hand.

38:57.370 --> 39:00.154
But he, he kept it
in an ankle holster

39:00.254 --> 39:03.037
on his inner
right leg, so...

39:03.136 --> 39:04.397
<i>So what?
So he's a lefty.</i>

39:04.497 --> 39:06.000
A lefty.

39:06.100 --> 39:09.643
Okay, so if he shot her
and she's dead, right?

39:09.743 --> 39:11.805
He's got all the time
in the world

39:11.904 --> 39:13.446
to just put the gun

39:13.547 --> 39:14.928
to his head
and pull the trigger.

39:15.028 --> 39:16.770
Now, why,
under those circumstances,

39:16.870 --> 39:20.013
does a left-handed man
use his right hand?

39:20.114 --> 39:21.814
<i>Why?
There are literally
a dozen reasons</i>

39:21.915 --> 39:23.015
<i>he could have, Charlie.</i>

39:23.116 --> 39:24.738
Well, sure.

39:24.837 --> 39:26.339
I mean, when you put it together
with all the other stuff,

39:26.439 --> 39:28.741
though, I mean, it begins
to stack matches.

39:28.841 --> 39:30.263
<i>I told Parker
you're distraught.</i>

39:30.364 --> 39:32.145
<i>You're emotionally distraught</i>

39:32.245 --> 39:33.906
<i>and I would speak to you,
but he shouldn't spend</i>

39:34.006 --> 39:36.069
<i>any more of the department's
resources on this.</i>

39:36.169 --> 39:37.991
<i>This is me speaking to you.</i>

39:38.091 --> 39:40.953
<i>Let this go and let's focus
on the task at hand. Okay?</i>

39:41.053 --> 39:43.557
<i>Hmm?</i>
Yeah, I, I, I, so,

39:43.656 --> 39:45.999
you, you tell the cops
what to do

39:46.098 --> 39:48.482
and, and they just do it?

39:48.582 --> 39:49.602
How does that work?

39:51.144 --> 39:52.326
<i>I'll see you
in the morning.</i>

39:52.426 --> 39:54.607
<i>♪ Get yourself ♪</i>

39:54.707 --> 39:57.971
<i>♪ Another fool ♪</i>

39:58.071 --> 40:00.073
Well I'm not a cop.

40:00.593 --> 40:02.596
Bitch.

40:06.359 --> 40:07.980
Any time now, buddy.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.904
John-O don't do this shit
no more, I told you.

40:11.004 --> 40:13.066
Alright, man
I'll bail you out, okay?

40:13.165 --> 40:15.629
Physician bail thyself.

40:15.729 --> 40:17.730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:19.772 --> 40:22.274
John-O:
Oh, nice place.

40:22.375 --> 40:24.397
Yeah. Uh...

40:24.497 --> 40:25.879
don't touch
anything, okay.

40:25.979 --> 40:27.721
By touch,
I mean steal.

40:27.821 --> 40:29.002
John-O:
Hey-o,

40:29.102 --> 40:30.283
this is that nice girl

40:30.383 --> 40:31.765
picks you up sometimes.

40:31.865 --> 40:33.767
You know, she's going
to be pissed

40:33.866 --> 40:35.868
you're breaking
into her home.

40:37.189 --> 40:38.812
Just wait
in the car, okay.

40:38.912 --> 40:40.894
I'm going
to be a minute.

41:02.776 --> 41:03.957
Shit.

41:32.685 --> 41:34.687
Shitsworth.

42:44.477 --> 42:46.459
Charlie, say that again.
Natalie's what?

42:46.558 --> 42:48.500
Her-her thing, her, when they
were going to cut it off,

42:48.600 --> 42:49.982
but you said that she got sick
and you had the combo

42:50.082 --> 42:51.504
for her thing
with the clicking thing

42:51.604 --> 42:52.745
where she puts
her clothes with the, the--

42:52.845 --> 42:54.026
Fuck, what's it called?

42:54.125 --> 42:55.868
Her locker?
Her locker.

42:55.968 --> 42:58.069
Goddammit. What is with me
and that word? Yes.

42:58.169 --> 42:59.352
<i>Her locker code.</i>

42:59.451 --> 43:00.593
Nine-two-four-eight.

43:00.692 --> 43:01.834
<i>Thanks, Chelle.</i>

43:04.857 --> 43:08.560
Nine, two, four, eight.

43:08.660 --> 43:09.922
Okay.

43:10.022 --> 43:12.024
Ahh, yes!

43:14.906 --> 43:16.908
Fuck.

43:28.359 --> 43:30.942
I'm missing something, Nat.

43:31.042 --> 43:33.044
Just tell me
what I'm missing.

44:02.073 --> 44:04.076
Oh, dick cloud.

44:17.769 --> 44:19.770
Holy holy.

44:31.863 --> 44:33.365
And that's it.
Look at the time stamp.

44:33.464 --> 44:35.446
She was cleaning
Mr. Caine's presidential suite.

44:35.547 --> 44:37.368
His laptop was open,
and she saw this.

44:37.468 --> 44:40.011
How, how do you know
this is Caine's suite?

44:40.111 --> 44:42.114
Uh...
The ceilings.

44:43.234 --> 44:44.455
See in
the background there.

44:44.556 --> 44:45.736
Presidential suite's
the only one

44:45.837 --> 44:47.178
with these high ceilings.

44:47.279 --> 44:49.020
I mean, she could
have just let it go,

44:49.120 --> 44:50.301
but she did something
about it.

44:50.402 --> 44:51.984
She took a picture
of it for evidence.

44:52.084 --> 44:54.105
So I think
he caught her doing it,

44:54.205 --> 44:55.707
had his bodyguards
take her home,

44:55.807 --> 44:57.509
kill her and Jerry,
set the whole thing up.

44:57.609 --> 44:59.111
That's a jump.

44:59.211 --> 45:01.073
There's no reason to think
this is connected to--

45:01.173 --> 45:03.234
Wait, you think
it's a coincidence
that she was killed.

45:03.335 --> 45:04.915
I'm saying it could be.
There's no solid connection--

45:05.015 --> 45:07.158
Okay, can we
just call the FBI

45:07.259 --> 45:10.361
and bust his sick ass
for this sick-ass shit?

45:10.462 --> 45:12.464
Let's take him first.

45:13.305 --> 45:15.307
Take his money tonight.

45:16.107 --> 45:18.109
And then we call the FBI.

45:20.111 --> 45:21.613
Fuck that!

45:21.712 --> 45:23.935
My dad always said,

45:24.035 --> 45:25.417
hit 'em
where it hurts.

45:25.517 --> 45:28.239
Hmm? Guy like this,
that's his money.

45:29.841 --> 45:31.843
This isn't going anywhere.

45:32.283 --> 45:33.625
One more night.

45:33.725 --> 45:35.346
So we do this thing.

45:35.446 --> 45:37.448
We hit him where it hurts.

45:37.968 --> 45:39.310
Yeah?

45:39.410 --> 45:41.352
Alright.

45:41.453 --> 45:43.073
Okay. We're rigging
the cameras.

45:43.174 --> 45:45.176
Test suite should be
ready by noon.

45:46.618 --> 45:48.620
Go get some breakfast.

45:59.991 --> 46:01.993
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

46:04.075 --> 46:05.375
The usual, right?

46:05.475 --> 46:07.477
Yeah.

46:10.040 --> 46:12.042
No, uh, coffee.

46:13.044 --> 46:15.466
Two seven and sevens
and a tomato juice.

46:15.566 --> 46:16.788
Hey, babe. Missed you.

46:16.888 --> 46:18.890
Hey, Debbie,
I'm off this week.

46:21.051 --> 46:23.053
Oh, God.

46:24.375 --> 46:26.377
Hey, Nick, can you, uh,
can you turn this up?

46:27.538 --> 46:29.080
<i>...battery and abuse.</i>

46:29.180 --> 46:30.841
<i>Frost Casino has released
video footage</i>

46:30.942 --> 46:33.163
<i>of an incident two days
prior to the slaying</i>

46:33.263 --> 46:35.566
<i>with Mr. Hill coming
to his wife's place of work</i>

46:35.665 --> 46:37.207
<i>in an apparent
drunken rage.</i>

46:37.308 --> 46:40.051
<i>Natalie, where are you,
you dumb</i> (bleep)?

46:40.151 --> 46:41.973
Hey, that's me.

46:42.073 --> 46:43.814
<i>Mr. Hill was
detained by hotel security</i>

46:43.915 --> 46:45.817
<i>and later,
at his wife's request,</i>

46:45.917 --> 46:47.919
<i>released without charge.</i>

46:53.004 --> 46:54.785
Hey, Cliff, wait up, wait up.
Are you going up?

46:54.886 --> 46:57.548
I thought we'd go up together
if you're going up.

46:57.647 --> 46:59.629
So I'm watching the news
and they're saying
about the whole thing,

46:59.730 --> 47:01.312
and I'm getting angry,
thinking what doesn't fit?

47:01.412 --> 47:02.493
Something doesn't fit,
and it's driving me nuts.

47:02.493 --> 47:04.035
And then I remember,

47:04.134 --> 47:05.797
you took Jerry
into the back room that night.

47:05.897 --> 47:07.357
I figured you would have
released him to the cops.

47:07.457 --> 47:09.200
So what was he doing
back home that night?

47:09.299 --> 47:10.922
But no, no, no.
You just let him go

47:11.022 --> 47:12.683
for some reason,
and I want to know why.

47:12.783 --> 47:14.285
Because the TV news said
it was at Natalie's request,

47:14.384 --> 47:15.966
but I was with Natalie,
and she didn't request shit,

47:16.067 --> 47:18.069
she didn't.

47:18.868 --> 47:20.290
Are you on coke?

47:20.390 --> 47:21.933
No. Coffee.

47:22.033 --> 47:23.975
So I thought
this'll be a good thing.

47:24.075 --> 47:25.776
I won't have a beer
and be a dumbass.

47:25.875 --> 47:27.538
I'll have coffee,
because that's for thinking.

47:27.638 --> 47:29.379
But I never have coffee,
and now I'm spazzing out.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.982
I'm sorry. I know that I am,
but this is important.

47:32.082 --> 47:35.066
You're asking
why we released him?

47:35.165 --> 47:37.107
Well, we decided
not to press charges.

47:37.207 --> 47:38.189
Give him a warning.

47:38.288 --> 47:39.390
And Natalie split.

47:39.490 --> 47:40.671
I think she went
with you, right?

47:40.770 --> 47:43.114
So, she wasn't
around anymore.

47:43.214 --> 47:45.276
What else were we
going to do?

47:45.375 --> 47:47.238
So he, he never tried

47:47.337 --> 47:48.558
to come back
after you let him go?

47:48.658 --> 47:49.919
He never came back
to the casino?

47:50.020 --> 47:52.022
No.

47:54.185 --> 47:56.187
Am I lying?

47:58.269 --> 48:00.270
No. You're telling
the truth.

48:04.515 --> 48:06.517
Two of hearts.

48:07.798 --> 48:09.799
Ace of diamonds.

48:10.600 --> 48:11.821
Eight of diamonds.

48:13.243 --> 48:14.225
Alright, come on down.

48:14.325 --> 48:16.326
Let's see how we did. Hmm?

48:22.051 --> 48:24.395
Alright. Bullshit,
true, bullshit.

48:24.495 --> 48:26.236
Alright.

48:26.336 --> 48:27.236
This is gonna work.

48:27.337 --> 48:28.999
So where is this camera?

48:29.098 --> 48:30.560
I can't even see--
It's right here.

48:30.660 --> 48:31.721
Right there.

48:31.821 --> 48:33.644
Huh.
Mm-hmm.

48:33.743 --> 48:35.366
He's going out to dinner
at six tonight.

48:35.466 --> 48:37.888
We'll swap these lamps out
for the ones in his room.

48:37.988 --> 48:40.451
And we'll station you
up in my office.

48:40.551 --> 48:43.292
Alright. And, uh,
how does it work?

48:43.393 --> 48:45.174
This is our shill, okay.

48:45.274 --> 48:47.857
You won't meet him before.
It's just safer if you don't.

48:47.957 --> 48:50.580
He's presenting himself
to Caine as Dale McClintock.

48:50.681 --> 48:53.464
Okay. He's been in the game
a few times before.

48:53.564 --> 48:55.566
He's going to wear
a clicker on his ankle.

48:56.245 --> 48:58.067
You're going to have this.

48:58.167 --> 48:59.388
Alright?

48:59.489 --> 49:00.790
One click for true,

49:00.890 --> 49:02.792
two for bullshit. Hmm?

49:02.893 --> 49:04.114
Say that to me.

49:04.214 --> 49:06.596
One for true,
two for bullshit.

49:06.696 --> 49:08.598
And don't freak out
when it gets big.

49:08.698 --> 49:10.240
Truth or bullshit.

49:10.339 --> 49:11.480
That's all you focus on.

49:11.580 --> 49:13.522
Huh. Always.

49:13.622 --> 49:16.285
Cliff will be ready to move in
if anything goes bad.

49:16.386 --> 49:18.388
Anything else...

49:18.828 --> 49:20.931
Anything else?

49:21.031 --> 49:22.772
I think that's it.
You got any other questions?

49:22.872 --> 49:24.875
Yeah. What was
the call about?

49:25.955 --> 49:27.297
What call?

49:27.397 --> 49:28.698
The night you pitched me
this whole thing

49:28.799 --> 49:30.299
in the crow's nest,
you got a call.

49:30.399 --> 49:31.902
Seemed like bad news.

49:32.002 --> 49:34.624
I asked, "Everything okay?"
You said, "Yeah."

49:34.723 --> 49:36.386
Uh-huh.

49:36.486 --> 49:38.488
You were lying.

49:40.971 --> 49:44.354
Uh, well, that sounded
more intense than I meant it to.

49:44.453 --> 49:45.955
I wanted to just
casually ask about it.

49:46.056 --> 49:48.058
But I've had coffee.

49:51.421 --> 49:53.082
What is this about?

49:53.183 --> 49:54.884
Are you saying
you don't remember the call?

49:54.984 --> 49:56.486
What the fuck is this?
No, no.

49:56.586 --> 49:58.687
It's okay, Cliff.

49:58.788 --> 50:00.790
I remember it.

50:01.111 --> 50:03.053
So who was it?

50:03.153 --> 50:04.694
It was Cliff.

50:04.794 --> 50:08.397
Well, great. And, uh,
what was Cliff calling about?

50:15.685 --> 50:17.687
What do you think
it was about?

50:22.692 --> 50:24.194
Some random thing.

50:24.294 --> 50:25.835
I don't know.

50:25.935 --> 50:27.997
A security thing.

50:28.098 --> 50:30.359
Well, you know I've been
distraught over all this,

50:30.460 --> 50:32.361
and I've had coffee.

50:32.462 --> 50:33.763
Alright. Hey. Yeah.

50:33.863 --> 50:36.966
Look, Cliff calls me
50 times a day.

50:37.066 --> 50:38.607
Don't you, Cliff?

50:38.707 --> 50:39.968
Hm? About 50 things.

50:40.069 --> 50:41.770
So get back here
at 7:00.

50:41.870 --> 50:44.053
That'll give us time
to settle in.

50:44.153 --> 50:46.154
Alright?
Hmm.

50:55.245 --> 50:57.245
You gonna say it?

50:58.127 --> 51:00.350
She's sharp,
but she doesn't know anything.

51:00.450 --> 51:02.631
No, no,
she's more than sharp.

51:02.732 --> 51:03.993
She's a human lie detector.

51:04.093 --> 51:05.314
And she's asking questions

51:05.415 --> 51:07.317
like she thinks
something's up.

51:07.417 --> 51:09.519
She already found the photo
of Caine's laptop.

51:09.618 --> 51:10.960
I don't know
how she found that.

51:11.060 --> 51:13.442
But you think
she's going to stop?

51:13.542 --> 51:16.125
She's a regular little
Michael Westen.

51:16.225 --> 51:17.807
Who?
Michael Westen.

51:17.906 --> 51:19.689
The detective.

51:19.788 --> 51:21.790
From "Burn Notice."

51:22.792 --> 51:24.794
Pull the plug
on this thing, Sterling.

51:25.154 --> 51:26.895
Play it safe.

51:26.995 --> 51:29.419
I worked for your father
for 25 years, and there's no--

51:29.519 --> 51:32.622
Fuck you, fuck him,
fuck all of you.

51:32.721 --> 51:35.984
I'm doing this.
It's my call, I'm doing it.

51:36.085 --> 51:39.428
Then we'll deal with her
and the girl and the photo.

51:39.529 --> 51:41.531
We'll deal with her?

51:44.013 --> 51:46.015
Whatever it takes.

51:46.736 --> 51:48.738
You're the boss.

52:02.672 --> 52:03.933
Valet captain: Have
a nice dinner, Mr. Caine.

52:13.241 --> 52:15.243
Room service.

52:44.232 --> 52:46.794
No Caine yet, we have time
for another round?

53:02.691 --> 53:03.953
Where the fuck is she?

53:04.053 --> 53:05.834
I don't know.
Where's Caine?

53:05.933 --> 53:07.676
All of his players
are still waiting at the bar.

53:07.776 --> 53:09.638
Caine's having a long dinner,
and thank God,

53:09.738 --> 53:10.799
because where is she?

53:10.899 --> 53:12.361
Give it another ten

53:12.461 --> 53:13.881
and then I'll start
making some calls.

53:13.982 --> 53:17.006
Okay. Good. Good.

53:17.105 --> 53:19.687
But what the hell? Huh?
You're 20 minutes late.

53:19.788 --> 53:21.950
If Caine wasn't late,
this would be a problem.

53:23.152 --> 53:24.812
Oh, sure.
Have a beer.

53:24.913 --> 53:27.816
Huh? Okay.

53:27.915 --> 53:30.218
But good.
You're here.

53:30.319 --> 53:32.361
It's okay.
I'm gonna go check on Caine.

53:34.602 --> 53:36.585
When he gets here,
he'll bring all the guys up.

53:36.685 --> 53:38.667
They'll get right to it.
So you stay here.

53:38.767 --> 53:41.189
We're not going anywhere.
Okay?

53:41.290 --> 53:43.292
We're good.

53:43.652 --> 53:44.792
We can order food
if you want,

53:44.893 --> 53:46.895
if you haven't eaten.

53:48.497 --> 53:50.499
Have you eaten?

53:52.301 --> 53:54.002
What?

53:54.102 --> 53:56.245
I got no way
to elegantly segue into this.

53:56.345 --> 53:58.247
So I'm just going
to launch in.

53:58.346 --> 53:59.848
Segue into what?

53:59.948 --> 54:01.689
My friend Natalie,

54:01.790 --> 54:03.131
how she did the thing
I'm always yelling

54:03.230 --> 54:04.893
at my phone about.

54:04.993 --> 54:08.216
She did the right thing
when she saw something awful,

54:08.316 --> 54:10.799
and she actually did
something about it.

54:12.480 --> 54:14.582
And you killed her for it.

54:14.683 --> 54:16.685
Well, you had Cliff kill her.

54:17.404 --> 54:19.406
Same thing.

54:19.808 --> 54:21.890
Say bullshit
if it isn't true.

54:23.410 --> 54:25.413
Look me in the eye...

54:26.254 --> 54:28.256
and say it.

54:31.859 --> 54:33.562
There's only one reason
she would have taken

54:33.662 --> 54:35.723
a picture of Caine's laptop.

54:35.823 --> 54:38.647
To turn him in,
to show someone,

54:38.747 --> 54:40.729
like the police.

54:40.828 --> 54:44.292
But she didn't show
the police, obviously.

54:44.392 --> 54:47.134
She tried to call me,
but I missed it.

54:47.234 --> 54:49.236
She didn't tell
her supervisor.

54:50.198 --> 54:52.901
So I figured Sterling.

54:53.000 --> 54:56.604
I figured she came to you
and Cliff that night.

54:58.366 --> 54:59.988
Did I figure right?

55:00.087 --> 55:02.589
You figured.

55:02.689 --> 55:05.513
This accusation
is based on figuring?

55:05.613 --> 55:07.475
I figured.
God, that's a weird word,

55:07.575 --> 55:09.037
you say it
over and over.

55:10.457 --> 55:12.921
I was figuring
until this morning

55:13.020 --> 55:14.923
when I saw something
on the TV,

55:15.022 --> 55:16.644
and now I'm done figuring.

55:16.743 --> 55:18.406
Now I know.

55:18.506 --> 55:21.209
Jerry had his stupid
little pearl-handled pistol.

55:21.308 --> 55:22.931
He had it on him
when he came to the casino.

55:23.031 --> 55:25.533
I saw it.
I told Cliff about it.

55:25.633 --> 55:27.254
Cliff wrestled him
into his office,

55:27.355 --> 55:29.696
then escorted him out.

55:29.797 --> 55:33.421
So what do you see here?

55:33.520 --> 55:35.462
<i>I'll</i> (bleep) <i>kill you!
I'll</i> (bleep)...

55:35.562 --> 55:38.026
I see what everyone sees.

55:38.125 --> 55:41.368
A drunk shitkicker threatening
his trailer trash wife.

55:43.491 --> 55:45.493
That's all there is to see.

55:45.893 --> 55:47.895
Nah-uh.

55:49.057 --> 55:51.058
Eh. Eh.

55:52.060 --> 55:54.062
Uh. Uh.

55:55.022 --> 55:57.125
What's missing?

55:57.225 --> 55:59.326
You can get this one.

55:59.426 --> 56:00.968
The gun's missing.

56:01.069 --> 56:03.651
And that means that,
that Cliff took it

56:03.750 --> 56:05.292
and didn't give it back.

56:05.393 --> 56:07.895
And Jerry never
came back for it.

56:07.995 --> 56:09.937
Cliff told me that,
and it was true.

56:10.037 --> 56:12.580
So that means on the night
of the murder,

56:12.680 --> 56:14.062
Jerry could not have
had that gun

56:14.162 --> 56:16.022
because it was right here

56:16.122 --> 56:18.125
with Cliff.

56:18.446 --> 56:20.448
You hear that, Cliff?

56:25.852 --> 56:28.855
Okay. Encyclopaedia Brown.

56:31.979 --> 56:34.841
Who else saw
he had a gun?

56:34.942 --> 56:39.406
Cliff, who's head of security,
will say that he wasn't armed.

56:39.506 --> 56:41.048
What are you going
to explain to the cops,

56:41.147 --> 56:43.290
that you can tell
when people are lying?

56:43.390 --> 56:45.413
That you figure
we killed her?

56:45.513 --> 56:47.955
That lefties never hold things
in their right hand?

56:49.877 --> 56:51.218
When you tell the cops

56:51.317 --> 56:53.701
in my town,
with my name on it,

56:53.801 --> 56:55.142
this string of,

56:55.241 --> 56:58.466
"I think this
'cause I think this,"

56:58.566 --> 57:00.667
what do you think
is gonna happen?

57:00.768 --> 57:02.770
Hmm?
Your dad's town.

57:04.531 --> 57:06.654
Cliff, take her phone.

57:10.618 --> 57:12.319
'Cause if you're recording
this conversation

57:12.419 --> 57:14.080
thinking you're going
to get a confession

57:14.181 --> 57:16.183
like in the movies,

57:16.624 --> 57:18.725
I don't know
what to tell you.

57:18.826 --> 57:20.287
I wasn't.

57:20.386 --> 57:22.388
Hmm.

57:25.232 --> 57:29.176
You know, you've been
distraught past few days.

57:29.276 --> 57:33.259
You've been drinking,
missing your shifts.

57:33.359 --> 57:35.582
I told your supervisors,
don't worry about it,

57:35.683 --> 57:38.946
'cause I knew you were going
through a tough time.

57:39.046 --> 57:42.509
But you were going
through a tough time.

57:42.609 --> 57:45.953
Losing your friend,
blaming yourself.

57:46.053 --> 57:48.134
Finally, I had
to let you go.

57:49.696 --> 57:50.917
You came up here tonight,

57:51.018 --> 57:53.681
and I tried
to break it gently

57:53.781 --> 57:56.482
but you lost control.

57:56.582 --> 57:59.125
And it's tragic.

57:59.225 --> 58:02.069
But, uh, before we
could stop you, you, uh...

58:03.830 --> 58:06.192
took a flying leap
off that balcony.

58:16.643 --> 58:18.464
Who's going
to believe that?

58:18.564 --> 58:20.567
Look at you.

58:22.288 --> 58:24.890
Who's going to give enough
of a shit to not believe it?

58:27.614 --> 58:29.475
No.

58:29.576 --> 58:31.278
You want
to walk outside,

58:31.377 --> 58:33.680
make it easier?
No. Really, no.

58:33.779 --> 58:37.803
Because I wasn't recording
our conversation just now,

58:37.904 --> 58:40.946
but I was
this afternoon.

58:47.913 --> 58:50.497
<i>...presenting himself
to Caine as Dale McClintock.</i>

58:50.596 --> 58:53.259
<i>Okay. He's been in the game
a few times before.</i>

58:53.359 --> 58:56.062
<i>He's going to wear
a clicker on his ankle.</i>

58:56.163 --> 58:58.185
There's nothing criminal
about cheating

58:58.285 --> 59:00.547
in a private poker game.

59:00.647 --> 59:01.948
And even if there was,

59:02.048 --> 59:05.451
see previous note,
re: my cops.

59:06.453 --> 59:08.194
You see, Sterling,

59:08.294 --> 59:11.076
you keep thinking
I'm trying to convict you.

59:11.176 --> 59:12.839
I'm not a cop.

59:12.939 --> 59:15.562
And a wise man
once told me

59:15.662 --> 59:17.564
you want to hurt someone,

59:17.663 --> 59:19.665
you hit 'em
where it hurts.

59:21.828 --> 59:24.330
I didn't send
the recording

59:24.431 --> 59:26.433
to the cops.

59:47.053 --> 59:49.055
He's gone.

59:49.975 --> 59:51.277
What time did you
send it to him?

59:51.377 --> 59:54.180
Uh, right after I left
the rehearsal.

59:55.181 --> 59:56.602
Maybe we can still...

59:56.703 --> 59:58.484
Oh, uh,
he's in the air by now.

59:58.585 --> 1:00:01.808
And, uh, every one
of your whales,

1:00:01.908 --> 1:00:04.370
every big roller
in the world,

1:00:04.470 --> 1:00:07.973
all the medium ones,
and most of the small ones,

1:00:08.073 --> 1:00:09.535
they all know.

1:00:09.636 --> 1:00:11.658
Everyone is gonna know

1:00:11.758 --> 1:00:14.279
that Sterling Frost Casino
plays dirty.

1:00:15.682 --> 1:00:17.624
You're blackballed.

1:00:17.723 --> 1:00:19.725
Because gamblers talk.

1:00:39.544 --> 1:00:41.768
You stupid fucking child.

1:00:46.551 --> 1:00:49.035
Oh, tell Daddy
how you handled it.

1:01:11.736 --> 1:01:13.739
Oh, fuck.

1:01:18.024 --> 1:01:20.026
Oh, fuck.

1:01:23.549 --> 1:01:25.611
What?

1:01:25.711 --> 1:01:27.252
Fuck!

1:01:27.352 --> 1:01:29.355
Ahh.

1:01:33.718 --> 1:01:36.361
Fuck. Okay.
Okay. Okay.

1:01:37.843 --> 1:01:39.845
Ah!

1:01:44.290 --> 1:01:45.750
We've got a code blue.

1:01:45.850 --> 1:01:47.393
We've got to lock down
all of the exits now.

1:01:47.493 --> 1:01:48.834
And get a guy
on the ground-level stairwell.

1:01:48.933 --> 1:01:50.355
I'm coming down.

1:02:20.526 --> 1:02:21.866
Charlie?

1:02:21.966 --> 1:02:23.968
Hey, Jen.

1:02:24.490 --> 1:02:26.491
Take care
of yourself, alright?

1:03:40.685 --> 1:03:42.828
Everything alright?

1:03:42.928 --> 1:03:45.310
Yeah. Uh, can I get a beer?
Sure.

1:03:45.410 --> 1:03:47.412
Thank you.

1:04:02.147 --> 1:04:03.968
Yeah.

1:04:04.069 --> 1:04:05.649
<i>Charlie.</i>

1:04:05.750 --> 1:04:07.752
<i>Long time no time.</i>

1:04:08.232 --> 1:04:10.615
<i>You know who this is?</i>

1:04:10.714 --> 1:04:13.939
Mr. Sterling. Yeah,
it's, uh, been a while.

1:04:14.038 --> 1:04:16.100
Sterling Frost Sr.:
<i>My God, kid.</i>

1:04:16.201 --> 1:04:18.203
<i>It's a mess, isn't it?</i>

1:04:18.883 --> 1:04:21.826
<i>I just spoke to
the medical examiner.</i>

1:04:21.926 --> 1:04:24.149
<i>There wasn't enough
of my son</i>

1:04:24.249 --> 1:04:26.250
for me to even identify.

1:04:27.372 --> 1:04:29.374
<i>It's a fuckin' mess, kid.</i>

1:04:30.375 --> 1:04:32.277
<i>I let you off once, Charlie.</i>

1:04:32.377 --> 1:04:36.201
<i>Gave you a life.
Pretty good life, right?</i>

1:04:36.301 --> 1:04:39.223
So, uh,
what happens now?

1:04:40.904 --> 1:04:42.807
Sterling Sr.:
<i>You tell me where you are.</i>

1:04:42.906 --> 1:04:44.489
<i>I mean,</i>

1:04:44.589 --> 1:04:47.011
<i>you might as well
tell me you are.</i>

1:04:47.111 --> 1:04:49.374
<i>'Cause there's not
a corner in this country</i>

1:04:49.473 --> 1:04:51.495
<i>small enough
for you to hide in.</i>

1:04:51.596 --> 1:04:53.578
<i>There's no
off the grid</i>

1:04:53.678 --> 1:04:57.020
<i>that's off-the-grid enough
for you to hide from me.</i>

1:04:57.120 --> 1:04:59.904
<i>I'm a tough old bastard
and I got some years left,</i>

1:05:00.004 --> 1:05:02.426
<i>and I'm gonna
spend them finding you.</i>

1:05:02.527 --> 1:05:05.310
<i>And I'm gonna hit you
where it hurts.</i>

1:05:05.410 --> 1:05:07.571
<i>And when I
do kill you, finally,</i>

1:05:08.613 --> 1:05:10.615
<i>you can thank me.</i>

1:05:11.495 --> 1:05:13.738
<i>Now, tell me, kid,</i>

1:05:15.019 --> 1:05:17.020
<i>am I lying?</i>

1:05:17.701 --> 1:05:19.703
