Hello.

00:08.105 --> 00:10.389
I'm Charlie's brother Alan.

00:10.391 --> 00:12.691
I want to thank you all

00:12.693 --> 00:13.692

you have "mixed feelings."

00:25.656 --> 00:29.541
Um... but I think
we can all agree

00:29.543 --> 00:31.660
that Charlie lived life
to its fullest

00:31.662 --> 00:33.862
and-and gave it
everything he had.

00:33.864 --> 00:35.547
Gave me herpes.

Chlamydia.

Excuse me, this is my dead
son we're talking about.

00:45.843 --> 00:49.177
I loved him and I'm
devastated that he's gone,

00:49.179 --> 00:52.981
leaving me with nothing but
my memories and my regrets

00:52.983 --> 00:55.267
and the listing for his
beautiful beachfront

00:55.269 --> 00:57.218
Malibu getaway
with three bedrooms

00:57.220 --> 00:58.820
and three and

01:14.420 --> 01:16.237
Okay.

01:16.239 --> 01:20.625
Um, I'd like to take a moment
to talk about my brother,

01:20.627 --> 01:23.261
um, and his incredible love
for life.

01:23.263 --> 01:25.797
He also loved being spanked.

01:25.799 --> 01:28.082
While wearing
my panties.

01:29.218 --> 01:31.720
He used my panties to make tea.

01:36.425 --> 01:41.262
M-My point is, um, that Charlie
lived life on his own terms

01:41.264 --> 01:44.649
and-and never apologized
for who he was.

01:44.651 --> 01:45.951
Yeah, blah,
blah, blah.

01:45.953 --> 01:47.719
Why can't we
see the body?

01:49.271 --> 01:51.990
Yeah, I didn't come all this way
to spit on a closed coffin.

01:51.992 --> 01:53.942
Okay, I understand how you feel,

01:53.944 --> 01:57.212
but unfortunately due to the
circumstances of his passing,

01:57.214 --> 02:01.132
the remains aren't exactly...
spit-able.

02:01.134 --> 02:03.635
I have a question.

02:03.637 --> 02:05.170
O-Okay.

02:16.732 --> 02:18.900
Who do I talk to about that?

02:18.902 --> 02:21.403
Uh, well, I think
that's something

02:21.405 --> 02:23.071
you'll have to discuss
with the lawyers.

02:23.073 --> 02:24.105
Yeah.

02:24.107 --> 02:26.658
I'd rather not involve the law.

02:26.660 --> 02:30.862
And now, uh, I thought
we'd take this moment

with Charlie at the end.

Thank you, Alan.

02:47.797 --> 02:50.599
Charlie Harper was
the love of my life

02:50.601 --> 02:52.801
and a wonderful, wonderful man.

02:52.803 --> 02:54.803
Selfish pig.

02:56.355 --> 02:59.941
Sure, our relationship had
its ups and downs

02:59.943 --> 03:02.060
and the occasional
restraining order.

03:02.062 --> 03:03.612
But at the end,

03:03.614 --> 03:08.717
we ran away together to Paris,
where he asked me to marry him.

03:08.719 --> 03:10.585
I said yes.

03:10.587 --> 03:14.456
And the next few days
were the happiest of my life.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.124
Nothing could spoil it.

03:16.126 --> 03:18.043
Not even when I came home
from shopping

03:18.045 --> 03:20.812
and found him taking a shower
with another woman.

03:21.865 --> 03:24.866
That's our Charlie.

03:26.535 --> 03:29.037
But I forgave him

03:29.039 --> 03:32.274
because I loved him
unconditionally.

03:32.276 --> 03:35.877
So you can imagine my horror
when, the very next day,

03:35.879 --> 03:37.262
he slipped on the Metro platform

03:37.264 --> 03:39.481
and fell in front of
an oncoming train.

03:41.050 --> 03:43.768
Never cross a
crazy woman.

I just want you all to know
that Charlie didn't suffer.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.502
I have been

12:01.504 --> 12:04.338
uh, rejected,
friendless, broke.

12:04.340 --> 12:05.540
I'm not broke.

I'm worth, like,
a billion dollars.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.211
Beg pardon?

12:10.213 --> 12:13.831
1.3 is what her lawyer says,
but I would give up every penny

12:13.833 --> 12:15.716
if she would take me back.

12:16.635 --> 12:19.187
No, no, no.
You don't want to do that.

12:19.189 --> 12:23.357

of girls for way less money.

12:23.359 --> 12:24.692

12:24.694 --> 12:26.010

12:26.012 --> 12:27.678
Right. Right.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.447
Um, just to clarify, um,

12:29.449 --> 12:32.900
did you say "billion"
with a "buh?"

12:34.070 --> 12:35.570

it's his.

12:50.185 --> 12:52.170

12:52.172 --> 12:54.088
That's my dead brother.

12:54.090 --> 12:55.506
Oh.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.176

Really?
