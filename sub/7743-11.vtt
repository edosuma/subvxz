00:08.717 --> 00:10.802
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:10.886 --> 00:13.096
l can't get my thoughts to slow down.

00:13.389 --> 00:17.058
l've seen success
with pediatric doses of Xanax.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.102
-lt's for my kid.
-That's rough.

00:19.395 --> 00:21.562
You pull me in here
and tell me l can't administer meds

00:21.647 --> 00:24.649
and you expect me not to push you?
What are you talking about?

00:24.733 --> 00:27.527
HR called me.
They're under the impression that someone

00:27.611 --> 00:30.655
in the emergency department
is abusing narcotics.

00:30.739 --> 00:33.574
l'm getting married.
l want to reserve the chapel.

00:33.659 --> 00:36.744
Stained glass windows,
the little candles, the mannequins.

00:36.829 --> 00:38.663
They're not mannequins.
They're statues and they're gone.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.289
We've gotta get them back.
lt's my birthday wedding.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.167
What gets Michelle Obama
out of bed in the morning?

00:43.460 --> 00:44.460
Fat kids!

00:44.712 --> 00:46.963
l'm not handing over
the First Lady visit without a fight.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.089
We've got to get out in front of this.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.174
lt's Haiti, man, all right?

00:50.259 --> 00:51.843
And they got nothing.
And when l say nothing,

00:51.927 --> 00:54.137
l mean, like,
l'm using a shoelace to tie off a gusher.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.557
l'm a week off the pills, right?

00:57.641 --> 01:00.059
-You're kidding.
-No, l'm not kidding.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.295
Hey, what's wrong?

02:09.379 --> 02:10.838
Nothing's wrong.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.590
l was gonna leave you a note
so you could sleep.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.468
l wanted to get in
some batting practice before work.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.386
Okay.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.265
You're in late today, right?
You can get the girls to school?

02:21.350 --> 02:22.391
Sure.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.033
Fi, honey, this is why you comb
your hair right after you shower.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.494
-Stay still.
-No, l can do it myself.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.913
No, you can't.
Please, you've gotta stay still, honey.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.541
-You're hurting my head.
-You know, do it yourself.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.543
You have five minutes.

02:49.837 --> 02:53.005
Dad set the clock on the stove
1 0 minutes ahead.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.299
We won't be late. Don't worry.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.425
When did he do that?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.928
The last time we were really late.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.680
-Do you want a vitamin?
-Yes, please.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.390
Keep combing, Fi.

03:02.641 --> 03:03.724
l am.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.829
You want one?

03:26.915 --> 03:29.584
No, thanks, sweetie. Those are for you.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.142
Thanks for meeting me. l know it's early.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.769
Hey, man, you call me
at 6:30 in the morning,

03:48.854 --> 03:50.396
l'm just happy no one's dead.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.524
Damn.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.484
That ball do something to you personally?

03:55.569 --> 03:57.570
Let me ask you something.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.322
You see my wife every day?

04:01.325 --> 04:03.034
Technically, yeah.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.452
So do you.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.289
Well, l can't look at her lately.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.125
lt's fucked up.

04:12.628 --> 04:13.961
Yeah, well,

04:15.130 --> 04:16.213
you know,

04:16.298 --> 04:20.301
ignoring the person you're married to
is a big part of making it work, right?

04:22.721 --> 04:25.640
There's all this unspoken shit
hanging there.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.894
Every day l wake up,

04:32.814 --> 04:34.482
l want to put it all out there.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.150
Fuck the consequences.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.487
lt's the hanging there
that's making me crazy.

04:40.489 --> 04:41.656
lt's...

04:42.991 --> 04:44.492
And l just...

04:47.454 --> 04:48.871
What do you want to say?

04:50.832 --> 04:53.084
You gotta know what l'm talking about.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.585
l don't.

05:09.685 --> 05:11.602
But l have people here.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.439
Yes, l understand that
nothing was confirmed.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.692
Or announced.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.196
But we were in contention for the...

05:24.783 --> 05:26.117
Of course.

05:26.952 --> 05:31.080
But l have very important people here,

05:31.707 --> 05:33.207
to meet the...

05:34.001 --> 05:35.084
Yes.

05:36.086 --> 05:37.294
Well...

05:39.965 --> 05:41.298
You could have called earlier.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.679
-ls today the day?
-The day for what?

05:47.389 --> 05:50.141
The end-of-probation day?
The let-me-do-my-job day?

05:50.225 --> 05:51.517
Today is not the day.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.227
lt's been two weeks, Gloria.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.854
l want to get on with my life.

05:54.938 --> 05:58.649
Jackie, l will effectively notify you

05:58.900 --> 06:00.651
when your probation has been lifted.

06:00.736 --> 06:02.361
Until that time,

06:02.446 --> 06:04.447
hands off, head down.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.991
Really? That's what you're telling me?

06:07.075 --> 06:08.784
Because l am at the end of my rope.

06:09.494 --> 06:10.578
Well,

06:11.246 --> 06:12.496
make more rope.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.207
Now if you'll excuse me.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.228
l have just received word,

06:36.605 --> 06:39.815
that the First Lady has decided

06:40.442 --> 06:42.651
to visit another hospital.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.948
But that does not mean we have lost,

06:49.076 --> 06:51.160
because you are still here.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.747
What l'm trying to say is that,

06:54.831 --> 06:58.876
even though the First Lady
has chosen another hospital,

06:59.628 --> 07:01.962
we will weather the disappointment

07:02.464 --> 07:05.716
and still have a great day together.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.561
Sorry.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.859
l'm sorry, l can't buy this.
lt's stressing me out.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.654
Doctor Temkin, in ortho, such a sore loser.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.740
He was convinced one of us
had some sort of inside info.

07:29.825 --> 07:32.993
-Told him Terry Bradshaw was my uncle.
-Awesome.

07:33.495 --> 07:34.912
Who's Terry Bradshaw?

07:34.996 --> 07:37.081
You are so lucky you met me.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.417
Your winnings. Big bills.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.295
-Oh, my God!
-l know.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.173
lt's like the bat mitzvah
l always wanted, but never had.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.758
l thought this was gonna be
the worst year of my life.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.218
But between this and getting married,

07:49.302 --> 07:52.388
it could be the half-worst,
half-best year ever.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.932
So, do you have a best man picked out yet?

07:55.684 --> 07:57.768
On the list. Gotta ask Eddie.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.856
Really?

08:02.858 --> 08:06.277
Because l just helped you
win a small fortune.

08:06.653 --> 08:10.030
And l also got my braces off
a week early, on purpose.

08:10.574 --> 08:11.866
Pictures.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.036
But, Thor,

08:16.788 --> 08:19.832
you can't be my best man

08:19.916 --> 08:22.042
and sing at my wedding.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.880
You're totally right.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.256
Overkill.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.471
Look at you. A little mascara. Going out?

08:34.556 --> 08:36.307
l am not.

08:36.391 --> 08:37.641
However,

08:38.560 --> 08:41.145
-l would like to invite you...
-Don't do it.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.771
...to a gathering.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.398
A soiree.

08:46.109 --> 08:50.112
lt's National Nurses Appreciation Week.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.448
-Jesus, Zoey, really?
-Yes!

08:53.074 --> 08:55.784
-l have reserved a room...
-Sounds awful.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.161
...in the basement.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.663
Just because it's a party in the basement

08:59.748 --> 09:02.082
doesn't mean it's going to suck.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.667
You guys,

09:05.045 --> 09:07.004
this party is important.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.090
And so fun.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.343
Appreciation week is patronizing.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.719
lt's for the overworked and underpaid.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.512
Secretaries, teachers, us.

09:15.889 --> 09:16.972
lt's bullshit. We don't celebrate it.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.808
That's crazy. lt's our week.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.435
lf we don't celebrate it, who will?

09:21.519 --> 09:23.854
Oh, my God, you're throwing
your own appreciation party?

09:24.272 --> 09:27.399
l appreciate us
and l want everyone to be together.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.235
We are together.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.278
And we're all gonna be together
at the wedding.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.030
lt's not the same.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.949
Please come.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.575
-Can't.
-Won't.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.705
l will make an appearance.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.549
Hey.

09:52.634 --> 09:54.885
-We got a problem.
-There is no "we."

09:54.970 --> 09:57.596
Yeah, well,
l think we should be fucking freaked out.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.224
-Kevin knows.
-Why do you say that?

10:00.308 --> 10:02.977
Because he lured me into a small space.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.353
He had a bat.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.522
He was swinging it
and he was talking about you.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.024
What did he say?

10:09.651 --> 10:12.653
He didn't seem like a guy
who wanted to renew his vows, okay?

10:14.114 --> 10:15.990
Look, marriage is hard, Eddie.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.575
Believe me, he doesn't know anything.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.743
lncoming trauma.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.913
Cab driver versus pedestrians,
guess who won.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.665
All hands on deck.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.711
Jacks, would you intercept
the cab driver, yeah?

10:30.672 --> 10:32.256
Tough riding the bench, huh?

10:32.340 --> 10:33.382
Yeah, kiss my ass.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.101
-How you doing?
-l'm okay.

10:44.519 --> 10:46.562
-All right, let's make sure, okay?
-l was turning.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.440
They went running across
the street somewhere.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.525
Her purse went flying. l have it.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.986
l didn't see them coming. l looked.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.613
Well, you can't always see
everything coming.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.782
lt's okay. Did you have your seat belt on?

10:58.867 --> 11:00.826
-No.
-Okay, you're all right.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.202
l need some help here!

11:02.287 --> 11:03.412
l can't breathe.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.164
-l got him, l got him.
-Okay, you sure?

11:05.248 --> 11:07.583
-Yeah, yeah. Over there?
-Yeah, over here's fine.

11:19.054 --> 11:21.680
Unbelted driver,
ran into those pedestrians in trauma.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.891
He started gasping for air.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.769
-Pulse ox is low. He's unstable.
-Not a show.

11:27.228 --> 11:30.481
Damn.
He's got a tracheal shift, pneumothorax.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.066
Probably on impact.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.484
He's gonna need a chest tube.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.110
l'll get O'Hara.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.279
No, wait, wait, wait. Stay put, stay put.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.781
Betadine.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.200
What the hell are you thinking?

11:41.284 --> 11:43.202
A needle decompression.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.579
Pressure's dropping.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.000
Get me 1 0 of Versed.
We're gonna need that for after.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.628
-You get it.
-Get the Versed, please.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.215
l can't get it. l'm on probation.
l can't handle the fucking meds.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.635
Prep him. l'll take care of it.

12:16.611 --> 12:17.986
There it is.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.203
Nice work.

12:27.872 --> 12:28.872
Better call up to the OR.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.874
Tell them we've got a chest tube
to add to the parade.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.126
l'll get on it.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.213
Don't worry, l didn't do anything
l wasn't supposed to do.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.298
l followed all the rules.

12:40.885 --> 12:44.054
Well, thank goodness
somebody's having an exciting day.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.976
You're okay.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.146
Snickers.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.857
Skittles.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.608
Baby Ruth.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.654
What do all these things have in common?

13:02.198 --> 13:03.949
-Benjamin.
-Sugar?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.076
Very good. Sugar.

13:06.661 --> 13:10.456
Now, there's nothing good for you
inside of all of this candy.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.749
You know what l like?

13:17.505 --> 13:18.714
Raisins.

13:20.258 --> 13:23.844
And if you eat all of them, you can do this.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.194
There were six of you.
Where are the other two?

13:40.361 --> 13:44.198
Thirty-year-old female called us
because she couldn't stop coughing.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.450
-That's it?
-Yeah, just coughing.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.576
Put her in five.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.661
Nice day for a cabulance.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.164
What's your name?

13:52.248 --> 13:53.540
Ruth.

13:53.625 --> 13:54.833
Can't stop coughing.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.251
And you just did.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.295
-Yeah, but...
-Ridiculous.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.838
This is a hospital.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.131
Yeah, l hear you.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.799
All right, everyone, count off!

14:03.468 --> 14:04.843
-One!
-Two.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.053
-Three.
-Start again.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.137
Sierra, stay with the group.

14:07.222 --> 14:08.430
-One!
-Two.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.183
-Three.
-No such thing as two threes.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.935
Start again. One!

14:13.019 --> 14:15.145
You have a minute
for something really important?

14:15.230 --> 14:16.355
Sure.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.527
l'm going to be here.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.905
And Eddie's going to be here.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.407
Fuck, l forgot to ask him.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.826
And Thor's going to stand here.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.164
Or maybe here. l don't know.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.668
And the mannequins will be back,
so it'll look a lot nicer.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.670
But l still need someone to pick up the cake,

14:39.754 --> 14:42.673
cue the music
and make sure everyone is seated.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.968
And l'd like that person to be you.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.929
-No.
-Come on.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.516
People are scared of you.
You'd be the perfect wedding coordinator.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.892
Why don't you ask Zoey to do it?

14:54.227 --> 14:56.103
Nobody listens to Zoey.

14:58.147 --> 15:01.275
lf l were still talking to my moms,
l'd ask them to do it.

15:01.609 --> 15:02.859
My moms.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.530
lt's your last divorce card, Coop.
You sure you want to play it now?

15:07.156 --> 15:08.532
Playing it.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.034
Wedding coordinator, check.

15:14.664 --> 15:16.623
-You know, she reminds me of you.
-Who?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.458
Cricket,

15:19.002 --> 15:20.335
my fiancee.

15:21.004 --> 15:23.630
Really? Well, good luck, then.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.732
Awesome.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.567
You do this every week?

15:43.651 --> 15:44.693
No.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.195
This is a special week.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.447
Yeah?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.074
Shit, is it our anniversary?

15:51.159 --> 15:54.786
We haven't been dating long enough
to have an anniversary.

15:55.079 --> 15:59.583
l love that you're not the kind of girl
who needs to celebrate every little thing.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.168
Yeah, l'm good like that.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.502
You are.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.379
l only recognize

16:04.714 --> 16:06.882
the really important

16:08.009 --> 16:09.176
holidays.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.679
Cool. Thanks for the sugar, boober.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.391
Jellybeans.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.734
Yay.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.195
What the...

16:28.279 --> 16:29.738
Look at this.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.532
Lenny came in.
He couldn't tell what it was for.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.326
Well, in much bigger news,

16:34.786 --> 16:37.079
l am singing at Coop's wedding.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.580
Wedding.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.875
The acoustics in here are insane.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.502
That's because it's an empty room.

16:43.586 --> 16:46.963
Well, l'm gonna rehearse,
just until everyone else gets here, so...

16:55.598 --> 16:56.723
No, stop.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.768
l need you to do me a favor.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.688
Would you refill this?

17:05.900 --> 17:08.276
lf she's already out, she's taking too many.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.404
She's not taking too many.

17:15.827 --> 17:16.910
Jackie.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.328
Please.

17:18.413 --> 17:19.871
Okay? Please.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.005
What are you wearing to my wedding?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.799
l'm not going.

17:31.342 --> 17:32.676
Too painful?

17:32.760 --> 17:33.927
Now l'm definitely going.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.765
Okay, we ordered her some codeine.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.768
-Christ.
-Chronic and persistent.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.271
-lt'll suppress the reflex.
-Yes.

17:47.275 --> 17:48.400
What?

17:49.110 --> 17:51.069
ls that bad, the codeine?

17:51.154 --> 17:52.821
Look, if you have a cough,
you go to the drugstore.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.906
You don't go to the ER.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.992
l don't want to get sick.

17:57.452 --> 17:58.952
Right over there, meningitis.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.580
Over here, bacterial pneumonia.

18:01.664 --> 18:04.666
lf you sit around here long enough
with your cough, you're gonna get sick.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.837
And unnecessary opiates
can do more harm than good.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.798
lf l were you, l would steer clear of the dairy,

18:11.883 --> 18:14.217
get some Chloraseptic
before you go down that road.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.929
l do eat a lot of ice cream.

18:21.017 --> 18:22.768
So do you want those? lt's up to you.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.145
No.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.775
Okay, as soon as we rule out strep,
we can send you home.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.580
What are you doing in here?

18:43.664 --> 18:45.415
That was such a rush, back in trauma.

18:46.209 --> 18:48.043
Let's go out and celebrate after work.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.378
l don't much feel like celebrating this job.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.672
-This fucking probation is...
-Jackie,

18:55.259 --> 18:57.052
your probation is my fault.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.514
l reported to HR after the pharmacy run
was flagged. The fentanyl...

19:01.140 --> 19:03.725
l covered Eddie's ass and my ass too,
but l didn't name any names.

19:04.727 --> 19:05.977
l'm supposed to believe that?

19:06.062 --> 19:07.521
You should. lt's the truth.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.107
Why not just tell them?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.693
You know, confusion's the enemy.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.864
What makes you think
we're on the same side?

19:19.408 --> 19:20.492
Why would l go out with you?

19:20.576 --> 19:22.786
We can sit around and talk about all the shit
you have to hang over my head?

19:22.870 --> 19:24.204
l see.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.707
You want some shit to hang over my head?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.001
Come out with me after work.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.420
l'll think about it.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.443
Don't you have a brother or a cousin?

19:55.903 --> 19:57.153
No brothers.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.865
l have a cousin in lowa. Or lndiana.
One of those states.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.701
Yeah, well, l'm flattered, Coop,

20:02.785 --> 20:04.202
-but l can't.
-Why not?

20:04.912 --> 20:07.038
Well, for starters,
what l think you're doing is crazy.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.165
Because l'm crazy in love.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.002
Have you thought this thing through yet?

20:12.086 --> 20:13.545
You know what happens
when you get married?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.922
Someone comes along, fucks your wife.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.841
And then you crash and burn.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.719
You're hopping along here
like everything's cake and sunshine

20:20.803 --> 20:22.721
after what, a month of dating?

20:22.805 --> 20:24.514
-Three weeks.
-l'm not getting involved!

20:28.978 --> 20:30.687
Honey, maybe the signs
just weren't big enough.

20:30.771 --> 20:31.771
No.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.818
-We could go see a movie...
-Stop.

20:38.696 --> 20:39.696
Fine.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.199
Are you lost?

20:44.452 --> 20:46.494
No, l was looking for her.

20:47.038 --> 20:49.164
Happy Nurses Appreciation Week. Here.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.583
-Shut up.
-What?

20:51.667 --> 20:53.376
-Who sent you?
-What are you talking about?

20:53.461 --> 20:56.046
-Are you fucking with me?
-What? No.

20:56.130 --> 20:58.006
l brought you flowers.
What are you getting mad at me for?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.634
Don't yell at her. Why are you here?

21:01.052 --> 21:03.553
Look, my mom's a nurse.
My sister's a nurse.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.138
My sister-in-laws are all nurses.

21:06.182 --> 21:09.017
Not like this is the only week
someone should get you flowers.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.144
You work hard.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.938
Thank you.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.315
Here.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.487
Thank you.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.493
And you look nice.

21:29.497 --> 21:31.289
Those are good jeans.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.965
Do you want to stay for the party?

21:40.800 --> 21:42.175
This is a party?

21:42.259 --> 21:43.468
l know.

21:44.345 --> 21:45.762
l'm on duty.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.516
-Rain check?
-Okay.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.353
All right.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.355
l'll see you around.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.694
-Hello? Lenny.
-You should be on vocal rest.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.030
Oh, my God.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.700
Hi! You can come in.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.702
Come on in.

22:12.081 --> 22:13.415
Hey, dude, wait up.

22:15.418 --> 22:18.086
Coop, l'm not trying to be a dick.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.796
l had a shitty day.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.632
l want to go home and feel like shit,
come back and try again tomorrow.

22:22.717 --> 22:23.842
Wait.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.638
Look, l know everyone thinks l'm an idiot.

22:28.723 --> 22:29.931
They do.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.559
And this probably looks insane.

22:33.394 --> 22:34.894
But l love her.

22:35.062 --> 22:37.647
l'm 35, my family just fell apart,

22:38.274 --> 22:40.275
l'm tired of eating alone.

22:40.860 --> 22:44.279
lt's not the worst reason in the world
to get married.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.407
l just want to move forward.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.035
l get that.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.203
So come on,

22:52.913 --> 22:54.456
best man it up.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.044
Jesus. All right.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.046
But do not hug me.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.882
-Hugging you in my mind.
-All right.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.343
All right, now, as your best man,
l gotta tell you,

23:07.428 --> 23:09.471
l don't know too many
happily married people.

23:09.555 --> 23:12.432
-We'll be happy.
-Yeah. Maybe you will.

23:13.184 --> 23:15.018
Hope is the thing
with fucking feathers, right?

23:15.102 --> 23:16.561
l don't know.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.902
Barneys, the big bags.

23:25.488 --> 23:27.030
Close the door.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.213
l refilled this for your daughter,

23:43.672 --> 23:44.714
but l want to help you.

23:46.050 --> 23:49.344
-You are helping me.
-No, this is a band-aid, Jacks. Real help.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.811
l will pay for rehab,

23:58.145 --> 24:00.146
which l think is a joke.

24:00.648 --> 24:03.942
l will take you to meetings,
which l know you won't go to.

24:04.026 --> 24:07.153
l'll send you on holiday to detox
but l know you'll be miserable.

24:09.073 --> 24:10.949
So what else is there?

24:13.869 --> 24:16.579
Or l will prescribe

24:16.664 --> 24:19.999
what l think is best for you in your situation.

24:23.337 --> 24:24.963
To get you clean.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.217
Consider me a very fancy methadone clinic.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.638
-Are you comfortable with that?
-Of course not.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.393
But it's the least of many evils.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.813
l know what l don't want
and that is to hear

24:43.065 --> 24:46.359
from your husband or Gloria Akalitus
or the police, God forbid,

24:46.443 --> 24:48.361
that you are in over your head.

24:48.863 --> 24:51.156
l just want everything to be

24:54.577 --> 24:55.702
better.

24:57.246 --> 25:00.039
And it's the only thing l can think of.

25:04.044 --> 25:07.255
Okay.

25:10.384 --> 25:11.718
Thank you.

25:19.602 --> 25:24.522
That is some real Hansel-and-Gretel shit
right there.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.359
l'm only having one. One is enough.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.320
Good.

25:30.404 --> 25:32.030
Go tell that lady thank you.

25:32.114 --> 25:34.157
Thank you very much, lady.

25:34.283 --> 25:36.075
You're very welcome.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.912
Would you like another cupcake?

25:38.996 --> 25:41.247
No, my mom says
l have to learn when to stop.

25:41.332 --> 25:42.624
lt's hard.

25:42.708 --> 25:44.000
You'll learn.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.960
Don't worry, you will.

25:46.921 --> 25:48.796
Well done, Miss Barkow.

25:49.590 --> 25:52.425
l used to hide crumb cake
underneath my bed when l was seven

25:52.509 --> 25:53.801
because my mom didn't believe in seconds.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.262
You keep telling them no,
they'll want it even more.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.181
That's right.

25:58.766 --> 25:59.974
Watch your tone.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.100
But yes.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.439
Oh, my God, why wasn't l invited?

26:06.649 --> 26:07.732
Where's Jackie?

26:08.275 --> 26:09.692
Married people scare me, okay?

26:09.777 --> 26:11.778
My sister got married on Halloween.

26:12.488 --> 26:14.197
l'm not kidding.
People thought that was weird.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.657
l didn't. l thought it was very considerate

26:15.741 --> 26:17.992
because that way we didn't have to explain
the bridesmaids dresses.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.536
You know what l am saying?
Because you're not gonna wear those again.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.038
Yeah, you guys are exciting...

26:22.122 --> 26:23.456
Seriously?

26:23.624 --> 26:25.416
You're married, kids.

26:25.501 --> 26:28.294
You've been working at the same hospital
for what, 1 0 years?

26:29.129 --> 26:31.589
You look like you could use
a change of scene.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.217
-Want a drink?
-No, l'm good.

26:35.678 --> 26:37.178
Tequila, please.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.304
Two.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.433
How long have you guys been together?

26:42.518 --> 26:44.185
Seven minutes? Eight?
Yeah, five minutes, good.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.520
You can speak up. lt's okay.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.856
I have news for you. She will spend $250...

26:48.941 --> 26:50.692
My God, she's dying up there.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.402
Yeah, and we don't have to save her.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.070
Yeah.

26:56.907 --> 26:59.075
Look, you don't know me.

26:59.243 --> 27:01.494
A week before you started,
l got in a car accident.

27:01.578 --> 27:04.664
Wrecked my back,
so l took a couple of patches,

27:05.124 --> 27:06.541
might have been four.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.001
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

27:09.503 --> 27:10.878
l took six.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.509
And l've never been to Haiti.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.641
Finally! Thank you.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.977
That was funny.
