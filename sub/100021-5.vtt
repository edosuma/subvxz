00:00.010 --> 00:01.665
Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...

00:01.666 --> 00:03.795
I would've thought she'd be back by now.

00:03.796 --> 00:06.709
She didn't even pack up
her shit. Not even a note.

00:06.710 --> 00:09.959
- You really loved her.
- I just don't get it.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.759
My focus is whether you'll be able

00:11.760 --> 00:14.219
to contribute meaningfully
to your own defense.

00:14.220 --> 00:16.079
Uh, yeah.

00:16.079 --> 00:18.079
Ms. Linklatter, you have
been found competent.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.769
It is therefore your legal right

00:19.770 --> 00:21.604
to have your day in court.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.732
"With public sentiment on one's side,

00:23.733 --> 00:25.229
nothing can fail."

00:25.230 --> 00:26.692
Brady say that, did he?

00:26.693 --> 00:28.499
The public is gonna set me free.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.019
I got a high school
buddy, Andy Halliday,

00:30.020 --> 00:31.039
runs an old bookstore.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.719
Well, some kid came into the bookstore

00:32.720 --> 00:35.379
asking about Rothstein... that kid!

00:35.380 --> 00:37.159
That's the Saubers family.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.239
Pete, we got another
envelope this morning.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.659
$9,000.

00:40.660 --> 00:41.999
Where'd you get the money?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.209
It's not coming from me.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.419
May I ask a question?

00:44.420 --> 00:45.959
Are we on a date?

00:45.960 --> 00:47.089
Would you like it to be?

00:48.040 --> 00:50.629
Everybody I touch suffers.

00:50.630 --> 00:52.599
You're really worried about her, Lou.

00:52.600 --> 00:53.761
She's fucked.

00:53.762 --> 00:56.514
- My doing.
- Not everything is your doing.

00:56.515 --> 00:57.519
But this one is.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.726
I wanna call Holly as a witness.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.145
She could be a De facto surrogate.

01:02.146 --> 01:06.309
"If you like Holly,
wait till you see Lou."

02:07.940 --> 02:10.419
But clearly, not gone.

02:10.419 --> 02:13.940
And that's your fear, isn't it?

02:13.950 --> 02:18.179
Once you're dead, gone,
gone, gone, gone.

02:18.180 --> 02:22.739

02:22.740 --> 02:27.146
let's call it, uh, totem pole fear...

02:27.147 --> 02:32.379
is that you were never
there in the first place.

02:32.380 --> 02:35.689
You got no legacy.

02:35.690 --> 02:40.069
You think finding my killer
is gonna give you one?

02:40.070 --> 02:42.099
Well, let me tell you something, bud.

02:42.100 --> 02:45.139
Legacy is shit.

02:45.140 --> 02:47.960
And shit don't mean shit.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.299
Thank you.

03:52.300 --> 03:55.579
So, like, Scrooge and shit?

03:55.580 --> 03:58.239
- What?
- Like, like, Charles Dickens,

03:58.240 --> 04:01.399
the ghost of Scrooge,
Christmas past, and shit?

04:01.400 --> 04:02.701
Along the lines.

04:04.180 --> 04:06.839
Fuck.

04:06.840 --> 04:08.990
Banging on about legacy and all this.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.560
Maybe he's right.

04:13.460 --> 04:17.089
You ever think about getting
psychological help or something?

04:17.089 --> 04:19.759
My insurance doesn't cover it,

04:19.760 --> 04:22.549
so I gotta slum it and talk to you.

04:22.550 --> 04:25.640
Are we anywhere at all?

04:27.920 --> 04:29.959
We're waiting on the DNA
on the hospital guy.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.639
I sent you the composite sketch.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.259
We're gonna release it
to the public tonight.

04:33.260 --> 04:35.949
So you're basically still nowhere.

04:35.950 --> 04:37.659
It's a process.

04:37.660 --> 04:39.738
You got your process and we got ours,

04:39.739 --> 04:42.658
except ours doesn't involve ghosts.

04:44.190 --> 04:46.999
I take you into confidence
and you mock me.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.040
- I'm not mocking you.
- Yes, you are.

04:49.050 --> 04:50.439
I'm not mocking you. Look.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.489
I'm just... I'm just saying
that if we're gonna solve this,

04:53.490 --> 04:56.740
we're gonna have to do
it right here on Earth.

05:08.580 --> 05:10.379
Hi, this is Danielle.

05:10.380 --> 05:12.187
Leave a message after the beep.

05:12.188 --> 05:15.359
Can you at least let
me know you're okay?

05:15.360 --> 05:18.929
Regardless of whether you forgive me

05:18.930 --> 05:22.609
or wanna get back, or...

05:22.610 --> 05:25.259
Fuck, Danielle. This is not fair.

05:25.260 --> 05:26.910
Just let me know.

05:43.660 --> 05:45.012
What are you doing, Mom?

05:45.013 --> 05:46.179
Hey.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.359
You've been going on about
these for over a year.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.891
I had to see what all
the fuss was about...

05:49.892 --> 05:51.969
You went into my room?

05:51.970 --> 05:54.999
What do you mean,
did I go into your room?

05:55.000 --> 05:58.659
Who do you think changes your
sheets and does your laundry?

05:58.660 --> 06:00.299
These are my books.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.849
Hey.

06:01.850 --> 06:03.599
I thought you'd be pleased.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.199
I spent my day trying to
understand my self-centered

06:07.200 --> 06:09.199
and pretentiously intellectual son

06:09.200 --> 06:11.869
with a C average at school.

06:11.870 --> 06:14.659
God, honey, these books
are not that good.

06:14.660 --> 06:17.001
The only one that shows any
promise is this last one,

06:17.002 --> 06:19.019
- but he doesn't even...
- The last one?

06:19.020 --> 06:20.672
Where he goes into advertising?

06:20.673 --> 06:22.999
Where Rothstein sold him out?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.919
A writer is more of a
secretary than God,

06:25.920 --> 06:29.219
so Rothstein didn't do
anything to Jimmy Gold.

06:29.220 --> 06:31.599
What Rothstein saw and
allowed Jimmy to show us

06:31.600 --> 06:34.679
is that most of us just become everyman.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.699
Ordinary, we just...

06:35.700 --> 06:37.399
- morph into the guy next door.
- No.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.340
Yeah, honey. Jimmy Gold evolved
into bland nothingness.

06:44.474 --> 06:45.640
I just snapped.

06:45.650 --> 06:48.650
One second, she was talking
shit about Jimmy Gold.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.359
The next, I had her by the throat.

06:51.360 --> 06:52.779
What stopped you?

06:55.060 --> 06:56.083
I don't know.

06:57.620 --> 07:00.700
I just let go of her.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.619
Anything more from your
friend, the book dealer?

07:04.620 --> 07:06.199
Has the kid come back?

07:06.200 --> 07:07.779
Not to my knowledge.

07:07.780 --> 07:09.940
He said he'd call me if he returned.

07:09.950 --> 07:11.431
Well, we can't just wait.

07:11.432 --> 07:14.559
Maybe the kid did come
back, with the books,

07:14.560 --> 07:17.059
which your high school buddy
bookstore friend now has

07:17.060 --> 07:19.980
- and is maybe trying to sell.
- That didn't happen.

07:19.990 --> 07:21.689
Why, 'cause your buddy didn't call you

07:21.690 --> 07:22.940
to give you the big heads-up?

07:22.950 --> 07:25.219
We're talking about
millions of dollars here.

07:25.220 --> 07:27.619
You need to go see your friend.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.139
Meanwhile,

07:29.140 --> 07:31.520
I'm gonna pay a visit to
Peter Saubers' mother.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.577
What's the pretext?

07:33.578 --> 07:34.949
My cat.

07:34.950 --> 07:37.289
You don't have a cat. You hate cats.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.749
She doesn't.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.679
I agree. Lou is shaky.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.279
This is a total crapshoot.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.219
One we have to take.

07:45.220 --> 07:46.740
She's talking about Brady, you know.

07:46.750 --> 07:48.459
Not listening to him. Him is Brady.

07:48.460 --> 07:49.839
I know that. I'm not stupid.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.879
Then there's Holly, like,
and the wheels on her bike

07:51.880 --> 07:53.499
aren't exactly fastened tight.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.139
I'll handle Holly.

07:56.950 --> 07:58.728
And how do we go about managing that?

07:58.729 --> 08:00.179
I'm sorry?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.080
I know what's going on...

08:02.090 --> 08:04.317
or what's on the precipice
of going on with you two.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.619
She's a fragile person.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.979
Meaning what?

08:07.980 --> 08:09.379
Meaning you need to tread careful.

08:09.380 --> 08:10.654
She's precious cargo.

08:10.655 --> 08:13.533
Right now, we should just
be focusing on the case.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.419
Yeah, well, Holly's the star witness.

08:15.420 --> 08:17.870
I am talking about the
case still, technically.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.159
Were you just talking about me?

08:21.160 --> 08:22.479
I have kind of a sixth sense

08:22.480 --> 08:23.959
for when people are talking about me.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.999
Well, maybe you need to
focus on the other senses,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.173
some of which could use some tweaking.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.427
He projects his anxiety
when he's nervous.

08:30.428 --> 08:31.959
Hey.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.999
Uh, so I've got something
on the father, Carl Fenten.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.099
Evidently, the mother is
dead, but apparently,

08:37.100 --> 08:38.799
he has a auto repair
shop here in Bridgton.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.259
- That's the address.
- Goody.

08:40.260 --> 08:41.270
Yeah.

08:42.809 --> 08:45.067
How's Lou? She ready?

08:45.070 --> 08:46.860
Mm.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.709
That's a great job. Well done.

08:49.710 --> 08:50.730
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.399
Good luck.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.899
Thanks.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.989
- Not a peep?
- Not yet.

08:57.990 --> 09:00.339
Hmm.

09:00.340 --> 09:04.579
Wow, and he's never called you again?

09:04.580 --> 09:08.129
Why you so interested
in this kid, Morris?

09:08.130 --> 09:09.699
I'm not interested in the kid.

09:09.700 --> 09:11.092
I'm interested in Rothstein.

09:11.093 --> 09:12.899
Now that he's dead, his stuff is worth

09:12.900 --> 09:14.279
who knows how much.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.885
I never knew you to be a collector.

09:15.886 --> 09:18.019
I mean, I know how much you love

09:18.020 --> 09:19.699
Jimmy Gold and all that,

09:19.700 --> 09:23.659
but to take it to the level of collector

09:23.660 --> 09:25.439
takes money, Morris.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.229
You come into some money?

09:27.230 --> 09:30.219
If I had money, I'd be going
to legitimate bookstores.

09:30.220 --> 09:31.738
Instead, I've come to you.

09:32.510 --> 09:33.948
I'm offended by that.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.689
Give me a break, Andrew.

09:35.690 --> 09:39.069
You buy and sell stolen books.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.379
Everybody knows it.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.599
Are you telling me that the
police haven't come calling,

09:42.600 --> 09:44.899
asking you whether anybody's
tried to unload a Rothstein?

09:44.900 --> 09:46.519
Yeah, the police came once.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.899
You've now come twice and called twice.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.549
You seem especially interested.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.619
My one chance in life

09:53.620 --> 09:55.859
to get my hands on an original...

09:55.860 --> 09:58.014
why wouldn't I be?

09:59.440 --> 10:00.540
'Kay.

10:01.780 --> 10:04.599
- If the kid comes back...
- Yeah.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.522
Or anybody else, for that matter...

10:06.523 --> 10:08.066
I'll call.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.380
So, Morris.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.560
What're you... what're
you up to these days?

10:20.579 --> 10:23.230
What're you into?

10:24.340 --> 10:25.410
Excuse me?

10:25.417 --> 10:27.569
Well, we're old buddies.

10:27.570 --> 10:29.087
We should catch up more.

10:30.140 --> 10:33.459
Word is that you and Alma Lane

10:33.460 --> 10:36.919
have been spending some quality time.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.099
Are you fucking that
old battleaxe again?

10:41.100 --> 10:43.143
If I were, it'd be none
of your fucking business.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.959
Sure would be a curious thing, though.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.599
Rothstein fucked her. You fucked her.

10:51.600 --> 10:56.440
Forgive me. I'm just a
sucker for coincidence.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.260
Good.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.360
Be seated.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.319
You okay?

11:14.320 --> 11:16.799
Fine.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.439
You seem a bit fidgety.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.135
I'm fine. I'm a fidgety person.

11:21.136 --> 11:22.759
It's not gonna be today, you know.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.019
Like, the prosecution has
to make its case first.

11:25.020 --> 11:26.619
- So you got time.
- Okay.

11:26.620 --> 11:28.049
I'm fine. I'm a fidgety person.

11:28.050 --> 11:29.199
I'm allowed to be a fidgety person.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.479
Good morning, everyone.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.699
Good morning.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.108
Good morning, Ms. Pace.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.269
Mr. Finkelstein.

11:35.270 --> 11:37.480
- Ms. Linklatter.
- Morning.

11:38.260 --> 11:42.239
And I-I just want to
remind you all again

11:42.240 --> 11:45.039
that this might look and walk

11:45.040 --> 11:47.359
and quack like a circus,

11:47.360 --> 11:50.376
but it's a courtroom.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.119
It's my courtroom.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.859
Wheels of justice...

11:53.860 --> 11:55.819
- Get on with it, for fuck's sake.
- The whole ten yards.

11:55.820 --> 11:57.592
Fucking blowhard.

11:58.830 --> 12:01.969
Ms. Pace? You have the honor.

12:01.970 --> 12:03.740
Thank you, Your Honor.

12:06.020 --> 12:08.470
The People call William Hodges.

12:09.980 --> 12:10.989
Excuse me.

12:10.990 --> 12:14.060
Mr. Hodges is not on their witness list.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.527
- He's on yours.
- What's going on?

12:16.528 --> 12:18.940
- I'm calling my first witness.
- Objection.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.780
All right, approach the bench.

12:28.480 --> 12:31.019
This is not a nice fucking start.

12:31.020 --> 12:32.459
Are you kidding me?

12:32.460 --> 12:34.875
He's on the list. There's
no unfair surprise here.

12:34.876 --> 12:37.131
- This is bullshit.
- Bullshit is in play here.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.139
He plans to backdoor jury nullification,

12:39.140 --> 12:40.199
and we all know it.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.093
You need to rethink this, young lady.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.439
It's all rethought. Detective
Hodges was in the room.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.419
He was there. He's a
material eyewitness.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.819
- And now he's here.
- I want time to prep him.

12:48.820 --> 12:49.939
You mean coach him?

12:49.940 --> 12:51.393
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

12:51.394 --> 12:52.439
Fuck both of you.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.220
This is not a goddamn good start.

12:57.060 --> 12:59.139
You got five minutes.

12:59.140 --> 13:00.339
- Your Honor...
- That's it.

13:00.340 --> 13:01.869
He can take a breath.

13:01.870 --> 13:03.979
He can have a moment.

13:03.980 --> 13:06.319
He can take a dump.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.839
But he's in that chair in five minutes.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.280
You got that?

13:12.500 --> 13:13.909
You wanted to see me?

13:13.910 --> 13:17.881
Oh, Peter. Yes, come in.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.000
Is there something wrong?

13:21.009 --> 13:22.760
Not at all.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.949
This is one of the very
best student papers

13:28.950 --> 13:30.679
I've read in quite a long time.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.919
Really?

13:32.920 --> 13:36.690
Because it was so... confident.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.929
Thank you.

13:38.930 --> 13:41.900
Hang on a sec. Would you sit?

13:49.996 --> 13:51.497
Did you write it?

13:51.498 --> 13:53.207
Of course I did.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.239
It's just that...

13:55.240 --> 13:58.421
You have never written
anything like this.

14:00.020 --> 14:02.779
Well, to be honest,

14:02.780 --> 14:06.219
I've never really loved
the books in your class

14:06.220 --> 14:07.879
till this one.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.560
Well, I'm not sure I agree
with your conclusions.

14:11.570 --> 14:16.219
You say that Jimmy is a
noble American hero,

14:16.220 --> 14:17.959
but is that really supported

14:17.960 --> 14:20.279
by the concluding book in the trilogy?

14:20.280 --> 14:22.119
Jimmy's still a rebel in the end.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.199
Why? Because he throws an ashtray

14:24.200 --> 14:25.239
through a TV screen?

14:25.240 --> 14:26.408
That's a symbol.

14:27.340 --> 14:28.599
Tell me.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.299
The CBS logo is an eye,

14:30.300 --> 14:34.019
and Jimmy's act is a ritual
blinding of his inner eye,

14:34.020 --> 14:35.458
the one that sees the truth.

14:35.459 --> 14:37.640
Well...

14:37.650 --> 14:40.359
you really are a Rothstein man.

14:40.360 --> 14:43.099
I'm impressed.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.119
But in your paper, you...

14:45.120 --> 14:47.219
you don't talk about how he died.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.019
- No.
- Well, I have to wonder why.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.460
I mean, this just happened.

14:52.470 --> 14:54.352
It wouldn't have fit the theme,

14:54.353 --> 14:56.599
and just to die like that...

14:56.600 --> 14:59.839
At least Rothstein's major work

14:59.840 --> 15:01.940
was done.

15:01.950 --> 15:03.659
Unless you're one of those people

15:03.660 --> 15:05.447
who believe he was still writing,

15:05.448 --> 15:09.719
and that he left this
trove of treasures.

15:09.720 --> 15:12.919
Well, I'd really love to
read those if that's true.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.080
Mm-hmm.

15:16.410 --> 15:19.586
I gotta go to class, um...

15:25.090 --> 15:26.859
You swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth,

15:26.860 --> 15:28.740
and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?

15:28.750 --> 15:31.020
- I do.
- Be seated.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.349
Mr. Hodges.

15:38.350 --> 15:40.859
Ms. Pace.

15:40.860 --> 15:42.319
You're a retired detective

15:42.320 --> 15:44.439
with the Bridgton Police Department?

15:44.440 --> 15:45.939
I am.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.579
You were the lead detective

15:47.580 --> 15:49.949
tasked with investigating
the jobs fair massacre,

15:49.950 --> 15:52.379
perpetrated by Brady Hartsfield.

15:52.380 --> 15:53.739
I was.

15:53.740 --> 15:55.619
You retired from the force,

15:55.620 --> 15:58.260
having made no arrest on the case,

15:58.270 --> 15:59.999
but you had occasion

16:00.000 --> 16:02.479
to pursue the matter as
a private detective.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.619
I did.

16:03.620 --> 16:06.039
Would it be fair to say
that you were consumed

16:06.040 --> 16:07.799
with bringing Mr. Hartsfield down?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.599
It would.

16:09.600 --> 16:13.519
Fair to say you wanted
Brady Hartsfield dead?

16:13.520 --> 16:16.849
I wanted justice, which he got.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.889
When a criminal defendant is executed

16:19.890 --> 16:21.339
before he's brought to trial,

16:21.340 --> 16:23.813
that coincides with
your notion of justice?

16:23.814 --> 16:25.859
There were extenuating
circumstances here.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.610
Which were?

16:28.940 --> 16:31.189
Brady Hartsfield nearly killed her.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.379
The man was evil incarnate.

16:33.380 --> 16:35.699
So if a criminal suspect is evil enough,

16:35.700 --> 16:37.859
you support a pre-trial execution?

16:37.860 --> 16:40.499
I'm sorry. Has this witness been called

16:40.500 --> 16:42.543
to give testimony or opinion?

16:42.544 --> 16:45.319
Mr. Hodges has a bias in
favor of the defendant.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.839
He's in fact a defense witness.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.919
I'm therefore allowed
to treat him as hostile

16:48.920 --> 16:50.384
and establish that bias.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.303
Well, just get on with it then, please.

16:52.304 --> 16:57.279
Brady Hartsfield,
in addition to killing so many,

16:57.280 --> 16:59.851
killed someone you had
personal feelings for.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.989
Janey Patterson.

17:02.990 --> 17:04.219
Is there a point?

17:04.220 --> 17:07.699
My point is that of all
the people in this room

17:07.700 --> 17:10.559
wanting Mr. Mercedes to
get his just reward,

17:10.560 --> 17:13.319
no one would take a backseat to you.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.409
Get on with it, Counsel.

17:18.359 --> 17:21.638
You were there, weren't you, Mr. Hodges?

17:21.640 --> 17:23.398
When Brady Hartsfield was assassinated?

17:23.400 --> 17:25.545
- You were sitting right in the room.
- I was.

17:26.319 --> 17:27.880
Can you tell us what you observed?

17:29.200 --> 17:32.959
I saw Lou, after giving testimony,

17:32.960 --> 17:34.599
leave the witness box.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.159
She approached Mr. Hartsfield,

17:37.160 --> 17:38.808
whispered something in his ear,

17:38.809 --> 17:42.769
and produced a weapon, and she shot him.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.349
In the head.

17:44.350 --> 17:46.773
Well, she aimed for his
nuts, but she missed.

17:49.770 --> 17:51.259
Is this a joke to you?

17:51.260 --> 17:53.999
The joke is that Lou
Linklatter is facing trial

17:54.000 --> 17:56.219
for performing two seconds
of community service.

17:56.220 --> 17:58.319
That's the joke.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.160
After giving testimony,

18:00.170 --> 18:02.639
did you observe the defendant
rush up to the victim,

18:02.640 --> 18:04.039
or did she walk calmly?

18:04.040 --> 18:06.359
The latter.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.469
She seemed in control
of her mental faculties

18:08.470 --> 18:10.659
from your vantage point?

18:10.660 --> 18:11.699
She did.

18:11.700 --> 18:14.639
And given your own hatred, your rage

18:14.640 --> 18:16.759
towards Mr. Hartsfield, I'm
guessing you'd understand

18:16.760 --> 18:18.879
the defendant's fury toward her victim.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.016
You covered that.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.999
In fact, who among us,

18:22.000 --> 18:24.643
given the carnage caused
by Brady Hartsfield,

18:24.644 --> 18:27.189
wouldn't want to blow
that monster's head off?

18:27.190 --> 18:29.901
Trilogy now. You've made
that point three times.

18:29.902 --> 18:32.440
If you had the chance,
would you have killed him?

18:35.698 --> 18:38.155
Did you not hear my question, Detective?

18:38.156 --> 18:39.560
No, I heard the question.

18:39.570 --> 18:40.869
It's hypothetical.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.359
It's actually not hypothetical,

18:43.360 --> 18:45.379
because you had two such occasions

18:45.380 --> 18:46.899
to kill Brady Hartsfield,

18:46.900 --> 18:50.125
where in fact, you began
to kill Brady Hartsfield,

18:50.126 --> 18:53.591
once in a hospital room when
you pinched his oxygen line,

18:53.592 --> 18:56.799
the other in a cell when you
grabbed him by the throat

18:56.800 --> 18:58.259
and began to strangle him.

18:58.260 --> 19:00.919
In both cases, you stopped yourself,

19:00.920 --> 19:02.139
didn't you, Detective?

19:02.140 --> 19:05.039
I did.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.820
Why?

19:09.760 --> 19:12.400
Don't much remember, truth be told.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.689
That's not "truth be told."

19:14.690 --> 19:16.259
That's a lie.

19:16.260 --> 19:18.159
You stopped yourself on both occasions

19:18.160 --> 19:19.679
because you did not want to sink

19:19.680 --> 19:21.279
to Brady Hartsfield's level.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.870
You did not want to be lawless like him.

19:23.871 --> 19:27.582
A mind-reader now.
Jack of all jack-offs.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.379
I don't need to be a mind-reader,

19:30.380 --> 19:32.919
because you gave that exact
statement to the police.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.919
You even said to be rendered lawless

19:34.920 --> 19:36.920
means that Brady Hartsfield wins.

19:36.926 --> 19:40.262
You did not want to give
him that satisfaction...

19:40.263 --> 19:42.719
the very satisfaction that
Lou Linklatter gave him.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.719
Your Honor, what is the point of this?

19:44.720 --> 19:46.439
Mr. Hodges is not on trial here.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.139
No, he's not, because he
did not commit a homicide.

19:49.140 --> 19:50.899
But he is here to give testimony

19:50.900 --> 19:53.100
in support of someone who did.

19:59.630 --> 20:02.493
You're a unique witness
in this case, Mr. Hodges.

20:02.494 --> 20:05.359
You know and care for the defendant.

20:05.360 --> 20:08.019
You harbored a compulsion
to get Mr. Hartsfield,

20:08.020 --> 20:09.624
who, as you say,

20:09.625 --> 20:11.279
was evil.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.919
You can appreciate the
anguish of his victims,

20:14.920 --> 20:16.716
many of them with us here today.

20:17.490 --> 20:18.919
You're unequivocally on

20:18.920 --> 20:21.721
the "hate Mr. Mercedes"
side of the fence.

20:21.722 --> 20:26.641
But you are also a man of law and order.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.359
You're a man who believes

20:28.360 --> 20:30.629
that this system needs
to be one of integrity,

20:30.630 --> 20:32.399
so I'm going to finish
here by asking you

20:32.400 --> 20:33.499
the toughest question of all,

20:33.500 --> 20:36.019
reminding you that you are under oath.

20:36.020 --> 20:38.299
One hell of a windup.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.779
As much as you understand

20:40.780 --> 20:44.160
why Lou Linklatter took the
law into her own hands,

20:44.170 --> 20:47.379
do you really mean to sit in that chair

20:47.380 --> 20:51.250
and advocate on behalf of vigilantism?

20:52.520 --> 20:57.619
I'm here to advocate for Lou.

20:57.620 --> 21:01.669
He stabbed her, for God's sake.

21:01.670 --> 21:04.529
So eye for an eye.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.015
That's where you stand?

21:07.580 --> 21:09.979
Is it your testimony that people,

21:09.980 --> 21:11.899
for the purpose of exacting revenge,

21:11.900 --> 21:15.440
should be allowed to take the
law into their own hands?

21:23.220 --> 21:25.520
Thank you, Your Honor.

21:31.450 --> 21:35.220
Let Lou go! Let Lou go!

21:40.800 --> 21:41.979
We love you!

21:41.980 --> 21:45.539
Let Lou go! Let Lou go!

21:45.540 --> 21:47.559
Over here! Detective Hodges!

21:47.560 --> 21:49.079
Why did Brady...

21:49.080 --> 21:51.640
- Why did Lou kill Brady?
- Detective Hodges!

21:51.650 --> 21:55.300
Let Lou go! Let Lou go!

21:55.320 --> 21:59.040
Let Lou go! Let Lou go!

22:07.140 --> 22:09.029
Thanks for all the help.

22:09.030 --> 22:11.829
Sitting there like a fucking zombie.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.081
Why didn't you say something?

22:13.082 --> 22:15.479
You could've established Brady
was able to keep killing,

22:15.480 --> 22:17.544
- even in custody...
- The judge shut that down.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.499
Slip it in sideways, for fuck's sake.

22:20.500 --> 22:23.129
No, because if I even
go near self-defense,

22:23.130 --> 22:25.339
I would be put in contempt of court.

22:25.340 --> 22:26.971
- Do you understand that?
- All the Cerebellin,

22:26.972 --> 22:29.419
medical wonder boy bullshit,
the whole thing...

22:29.420 --> 22:32.059
None of that negates
that Lou executed him,

22:32.060 --> 22:34.099
and for us to try to deny that...

22:34.100 --> 22:37.059
we will look like we're
okay with murder!

22:37.060 --> 22:38.319
What's your plan?

22:38.320 --> 22:41.559
I've told you our plan.
Involuntary manslaughter.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.429
It's a fine line... one that I can walk.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.907
- I don't fucking think so.
- Okay, stop it, both of you.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.079
I have to be off to see
Carl Fenten's dad.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.179
Maybe you can go and get yourself

22:51.180 --> 22:52.489
a law degree or something.

22:52.490 --> 22:54.479
- I'll see you back at the office...
- Fuck off.

22:54.480 --> 22:56.159
Fuck off yourself.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.290
See you back in the office.

23:04.720 --> 23:07.449
Did it go that badly?

23:07.450 --> 23:09.220
Not at all.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.880
No new information came in.

23:15.400 --> 23:19.840
He came off sympathetic to
Lou, which the jury saw.

23:20.830 --> 23:24.439
He's just not the cleanup
hitter that we hoped.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.099
- Right.
- It's all going to come down

23:26.100 --> 23:28.269
to Lou's testimony anyway,

23:28.270 --> 23:30.209
and yours.

23:30.210 --> 23:31.569
Right.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.140
Holly.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.159
If you don't feel up to it...

23:38.160 --> 23:40.740
No, I have to be up to it.

23:43.950 --> 23:47.489
I will just ask questions.

23:47.490 --> 23:49.339
And you just give honest answers.

23:49.340 --> 23:52.720
You just... just be yourself.

23:54.280 --> 23:57.979
'Kay. Yeah.

24:01.691 --> 24:04.769
♪ I can't be bothered ♪

24:04.770 --> 24:09.099
♪ To miss you anymore ♪

24:09.100 --> 24:14.911
♪ It's month 12, day 31, and hour 24 ♪

24:16.520 --> 24:18.439
♪ I used to think ♪

24:28.530 --> 24:31.659
Shit, shit, shit.

24:31.660 --> 24:33.869
- Is he in trouble?
- Not at all.

24:36.140 --> 24:38.018
Then I don't understand.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.879
The crash site was less
than a mile from here.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.939
Peter has been known to walk the area.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.919
It's possible he came upon the wreckage.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.861
But he didn't. He would've told us.

24:47.862 --> 24:50.389
There was money, we think, in the car,

24:50.390 --> 24:53.114
possibly connected to the
John Rothstein murder.

24:53.115 --> 24:56.079
It's possible some of
Rothstein's merchandise,

24:56.080 --> 24:59.079
manuscripts, even, were in the wreckage.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.539
And it's possible somebody
came upon the crash site,

25:02.540 --> 25:04.128
found the money and merchandise,

25:04.129 --> 25:06.099
and absconded with it.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.756
You think Peter did this?

25:07.757 --> 25:10.132
We're talking to everybody
in the vicinity.

25:10.133 --> 25:11.339
How has Peter seemed recently?

25:11.340 --> 25:13.259
How has he seemed?

25:13.260 --> 25:17.219
Mrs. Saubers, we're really not
trying to be antagonistic.

25:17.220 --> 25:19.679
Okay, you are in my home,

25:19.680 --> 25:21.979
asking questions about my son

25:21.980 --> 25:24.739
and whether or not he's in
possession of stolen property.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.734
What is that if not antagonistic?

25:28.540 --> 25:30.399
And what about your
husband? Where is he?

25:30.400 --> 25:31.879
He's in court.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.110
Court?

25:34.460 --> 25:38.959
The trial for the woman
who killed Mr. Mercedes.

25:38.960 --> 25:42.208
My husband was crippled
at the jobs massacre.

25:44.980 --> 25:46.939
We noticed, uh,

25:46.940 --> 25:50.799
he recently leased some
space on Center Street.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.779
Yes.

25:52.780 --> 25:55.119
He used to be a real estate
broker before the accident,

25:55.120 --> 25:57.009
and he's decided to get back into it.

25:57.010 --> 26:00.799
It's not cheap leasing space
right on Center Street.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.978
Did he come into some money recently?

26:02.979 --> 26:04.980
An inheritance, maybe?

26:13.020 --> 26:14.100
Don Fenten?

26:17.060 --> 26:18.569
You a cop?

26:18.570 --> 26:20.859
May I have a word, please?

26:20.860 --> 26:23.630
My son was a dope.

26:24.860 --> 26:28.019
He was good at driving cars, which is...

26:28.020 --> 26:31.639
why I think he was
chosen to do something

26:31.640 --> 26:33.759
way, way over his head.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.049
He didn't kill Rothstein.

26:38.050 --> 26:39.739
How can you know that?

26:39.740 --> 26:41.879
My son didn't own a gun.

26:41.880 --> 26:44.159
You check his priors,

26:44.160 --> 26:46.219
robbery, yes, but never armed robbery.

26:46.220 --> 26:49.019
It just wasn't in Carl.

26:49.020 --> 26:50.940
The other guy killed Rothstein.

26:50.950 --> 26:52.110
Had to be.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.450
Well, let's turn to the other guy.

26:55.460 --> 26:58.740
You can't conceive who it might be?

26:59.880 --> 27:03.240
Somebody dominant. Somebody alpha.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.119
I don't think he had any idea

27:07.120 --> 27:09.440
what he was getting himself into.

27:13.170 --> 27:17.220
It might help if you could
visit her before court.

27:18.300 --> 27:20.559
In lockup?

27:20.560 --> 27:23.600
Oh, it'd have to be lockup.

27:23.601 --> 27:27.119
They're not gonna let her
out to make a burger run.

27:27.120 --> 27:30.590
- If you'd rather not, though...
- No, I can do it.

27:38.660 --> 27:40.089
Holly...

27:40.090 --> 27:42.359
I admit I'm a little torn.

27:42.360 --> 27:45.029
I'm duty-bound to protect
Lou's constitution

27:45.030 --> 27:48.479
any way I can if she becomes unhinged.

27:48.480 --> 27:52.029
But I also worry

27:52.030 --> 27:54.673
about your own emotional footing.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.880
I don't know how to be.

28:00.540 --> 28:03.439
Well, as I said, you just be yourself,

28:03.440 --> 28:05.439
and I'll just ask the questions...

28:05.440 --> 28:08.839
No, I don't mean in court.
I mean, right now.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.439
I don't know how to be...

28:11.440 --> 28:13.440
sitting in a car with you.

28:16.250 --> 28:18.447
You're scared I might try
to kiss you or something?

28:18.448 --> 28:20.539
No. Well, yeah.

28:20.540 --> 28:23.999
- N-no.
- Oh, so we're clear, then?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.700
No, I'm... I...

28:28.100 --> 28:30.299
I am afraid that you'll kiss me.

28:30.300 --> 28:33.300
I'm terrified of it, but...

28:34.360 --> 28:37.439
I also want to kiss you.

28:37.440 --> 28:41.659
But what I want is way trumped by fear.

28:41.660 --> 28:43.080
Terror.

28:44.660 --> 28:48.849
You may be the most honest
person I've ever met.

28:48.850 --> 28:51.099
See, and that terrifies
me because it was sweet,

28:51.100 --> 28:54.220
you know, it was nice in a
path-to-intimacy kind of way.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.879
That makes me need to pee.

28:56.880 --> 28:59.359
Sorry.

28:59.360 --> 29:00.720
Okay.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.449
- Look.
- Mm-hmm?

29:04.450 --> 29:07.659
I'm not going to kiss you tonight.

29:07.660 --> 29:10.299
But...

29:10.300 --> 29:13.959
I don't want you to fear the future.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.899
I'm just gonna show you
what it would be like

29:15.900 --> 29:17.920
so you'll be less terrified of it.

29:34.460 --> 29:36.219
How was it?

29:36.220 --> 29:40.799
It was really, really good.

29:40.800 --> 29:45.529
I mean, albeit in a short
and uneventful way.

29:45.530 --> 29:47.759
Wait, can you put me on the stand still

29:47.760 --> 29:49.399
now that you kissed me, though?

29:49.400 --> 29:51.319
I can.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.760
'Kay.

29:53.770 --> 29:55.899
I don't know why I asked.

29:55.900 --> 29:58.099
Suspected something how?

29:58.100 --> 30:01.039
I don't know. He just seemed suspicious.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.299
Curious as to my interest in Rothstein,

30:03.300 --> 30:04.919
- even though he's known forever...
- And the Saubers kid

30:04.920 --> 30:06.239
hasn't been back to the bookstore?

30:06.240 --> 30:08.579
- Not once?
- So he says.

30:08.580 --> 30:11.429
I wonder.

30:11.430 --> 30:13.019
Police being at the Saubers house...

30:13.020 --> 30:16.159
obviously, we're not the
only ones sniffing this kid.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.779
I'm almost rooting for
the cops at this point.

30:18.780 --> 30:20.599
Excuse me?

30:20.600 --> 30:22.859
If they find those books,
you know, I won't get rich,

30:22.860 --> 30:27.739
but... at least I'll get
to read them, maybe.

30:27.740 --> 30:29.979
My God.

30:29.980 --> 30:33.019
That's really what it's
about with you, isn't it?

30:33.020 --> 30:35.399
Getting to read those books.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.239
I have to see what he became.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.560
I have to know.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.923
I'm gonna try again
tomorrow with the mother.

30:43.924 --> 30:45.919
Hopefully, the cops won't be there.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.346
Who are you texting?

30:47.347 --> 30:49.059
Danielle.

30:49.060 --> 30:51.059
I still don't get it. Gone.

30:51.060 --> 30:54.639
Whoosh. Fucking nothing.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.879
Morris, I'm gonna ask
you an honest question,

30:56.880 --> 30:58.759
and I want an honest answer.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.579
What?

31:00.580 --> 31:02.019
I think it's sweet that you miss

31:02.020 --> 31:03.980
your twitty little Danielle.

31:05.780 --> 31:06.899
That's your question?

31:06.900 --> 31:08.659
No, my question is,

31:08.660 --> 31:09.989
when you fuck me,

31:09.990 --> 31:11.879
do you think of that
twitty little thing?

31:11.880 --> 31:13.370
'Cause that would not be good.

31:15.530 --> 31:19.579
You're... being disgusting.

31:19.580 --> 31:21.289
I don't give a shit.

31:21.290 --> 31:24.460
When a man's in me, he better be all in.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.596
You're going to court
tomorrow, by the way.

31:29.597 --> 31:31.765
Court? Why?

31:33.000 --> 31:34.809
Because I have an idea.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.519
Don't fucking lie to me, Peter!

31:36.520 --> 31:38.539
- I'm not fucking lying.
- Bullshit!

31:38.540 --> 31:40.315
- Tom!
- He's lying to me. Bullshit.

31:40.316 --> 31:43.429
Peter, there was money
in the car, right?

31:43.430 --> 31:46.071
Huh? There were probably
Rothstein books as well.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.859
I've got anonymous cash donations

31:47.860 --> 31:49.399
showing up at this house in the mail.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.419
You are all into fucking John Rothstein.

31:51.420 --> 31:53.039
- The cops are knocking at the door.
- Dad, Dad,

31:53.040 --> 31:54.619
Dad, they're teaching
Rothstein in school.

31:54.620 --> 31:55.679
Who the fuck isn't reading Rothstein...

31:55.680 --> 31:57.080
- Bullshit. He's lying to me.
- Tom.

31:59.840 --> 32:02.079
Peter.

32:02.080 --> 32:05.519
We are honest people, okay?

32:05.520 --> 32:08.199
We may not have much, but we have that.

32:08.200 --> 32:10.599
We are honest people.

32:10.600 --> 32:14.219
Peter, just tell us.

32:14.220 --> 32:15.539
Are you in trouble?

32:15.540 --> 32:17.699
I'm not in trouble.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.099
I wanna see those books
you got from the library.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.339
- I returned them.
- See?

32:21.340 --> 32:22.919
He's fucking lying, Marjorie.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.229
Fuck off!

32:24.230 --> 32:25.239
What did you say to me?

32:25.240 --> 32:26.651
- You say that to me one more time.
- You wanna fight.

32:26.652 --> 32:28.699
- No! Don't you dare!
- You say that to me one more fucking time.

32:28.700 --> 32:30.220
Fuck you!

32:36.520 --> 32:39.439
The defense essentially
planned to use Hodges as

32:39.440 --> 32:40.899
kind of a secret weapon,

32:40.900 --> 32:44.579
but the district attorney let
the air out of their tires.

32:44.580 --> 32:46.839
You could practically see
that big man deflate

32:46.840 --> 32:48.699
with a big hiss.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.539
Hey!

32:52.540 --> 32:54.759
You're on the TV.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.379
Nobody can call you ordinary now.

32:57.380 --> 32:59.999
You fucked your friend Lou,

33:00.000 --> 33:02.579
haven't found my killer,

33:02.580 --> 33:06.640
talked about on television...

33:06.650 --> 33:09.819
you are a spectacular failure.

33:09.820 --> 33:12.899
Nothing spectacular about it.

33:12.900 --> 33:15.759
They only put ordinary
failures on TV nowadays.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.179
It makes the ads look better.

33:17.180 --> 33:20.249
Well, there's no such thing
as bad publicity, bud.

33:20.250 --> 33:23.379
I mean, "I never miss a chance

33:23.380 --> 33:25.299
"to have sex

33:25.300 --> 33:27.919
or be interviewed on the TV."

33:27.920 --> 33:30.419
When did you say that?

33:30.420 --> 33:32.429
Gore Vidal said that.

33:32.430 --> 33:35.839
Jesus Christ, bud, you
never read anybody but me?

33:35.840 --> 33:39.859
Not Gore fucking Vidal,
I'll tell you that much.

33:39.860 --> 33:43.079
You spoke to me like you knew who I am,

33:43.080 --> 33:45.139
who I was...

33:45.140 --> 33:47.599
Can I tell you a secret?

33:47.600 --> 33:50.409
I never spoke to you.

33:50.410 --> 33:52.359
You're speaking to me now.

33:52.360 --> 33:56.399
You are speaking to you now.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.399
Okay.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.120
If you're so smart, tell me this.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.899
Is Brady Satan?

34:05.900 --> 34:07.669
Satan?

34:07.670 --> 34:10.708
Brady, Satan? There is no Satan.

34:10.710 --> 34:14.899
Oh, my God. Satan's a human creation.

34:14.900 --> 34:19.399
He's like God or Cheez
Whiz, or, you know...

34:19.400 --> 34:21.998
Billy, I think you're missing the point.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.899
There's only one way out,

34:24.900 --> 34:27.190
and that's in.

34:37.460 --> 34:39.286
Hello?

34:41.000 --> 34:42.199
Hello?

34:42.199 --> 34:43.458
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:43.460 --> 34:44.969
Ooh, it's a little poochy.

34:44.969 --> 34:47.699
Poochy! What a beautiful dog.

34:47.699 --> 34:49.319
Oh, you... whoo!

34:49.320 --> 34:50.899
He likes me.

34:50.900 --> 34:54.051
My name is Alma Lane and I
am so sorry to disturb you,

34:54.052 --> 34:56.819
but my cat, Carleton, he's gone missing,

34:56.820 --> 34:59.649
and I'm passing out some flyers.

34:59.650 --> 35:01.829
This is my little Carleton...

35:01.830 --> 35:03.399
- a bit of a wanderer.
- _

35:03.400 --> 35:06.459
Usually, I'm not concerned,
but it's been over a week now.

35:06.460 --> 35:08.679
Have you seen him?

35:08.680 --> 35:10.499
I'm sorry, no.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.259
It's just not like him

35:12.260 --> 35:14.340
to stay away this long.

35:17.620 --> 35:19.785
Are you all right, dear?

35:20.980 --> 35:23.719
I'm fine.

35:23.720 --> 35:25.240
Why are you staring at me?

35:25.248 --> 35:26.809
Oh, I don't mean to.

35:26.810 --> 35:28.369
I'm sorry.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.539
Truth be told, I'm a little psychic.

35:33.540 --> 35:37.039
I walked up here worried about my cat.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.221
Now I'm a little worried about you.

35:43.370 --> 35:45.267
You need to be pretty.

35:47.104 --> 35:49.429
And not too twitchy.

35:49.430 --> 35:53.199
I don't find you twitchy in a bad way,

35:53.200 --> 35:55.859
but I need you to be
comfortable in your own skin

35:55.860 --> 35:57.529
in a way that...

35:59.860 --> 36:01.576
in a way that I can't.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.940
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

36:10.520 --> 36:12.759
I'm worried about you.

36:12.760 --> 36:16.209
You seem... erratic.

36:16.210 --> 36:20.059
Yeah, well, I'm on trial
for my life, and your...

36:20.060 --> 36:21.379
boss?

36:21.380 --> 36:23.556
He didn't exactly carry
the day on my behalf.

36:23.557 --> 36:25.019
Well, I mean,

36:25.020 --> 36:27.680
he was a little boxed in by the truth.

36:30.070 --> 36:32.260
Oh, yeah? What about you?

36:35.640 --> 36:37.480
I'll need to tell the truth as well.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.820
You and I,

36:42.826 --> 36:45.779
we're Brady bashers.

36:45.780 --> 36:48.219
I shot him.

36:48.220 --> 36:51.559
And you... oh, girl.

36:51.560 --> 36:55.379
You just...

36:59.740 --> 37:02.839
Your job is to show the jury

37:02.840 --> 37:05.609
that Brady-bashing... oh.

37:05.610 --> 37:07.279
It's such a good thing.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.679
Brady-bashing is sympathetic

37:09.680 --> 37:13.880
and so... pretty.

37:15.590 --> 37:17.569
You have a very odd tone, Lou.

37:17.570 --> 37:20.019
I'm a little uneasy.

37:20.020 --> 37:24.960
I'm gonna be sounding real
good when I'm out, though.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.939
She's getting worse.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.939
And the way she talks is
how Brady would talk.

37:30.940 --> 37:33.959
I mean, not that I ever
spoke with Brady, you know.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.289
I did. You're not wrong.

37:36.290 --> 37:38.990
He's in her head somehow.

37:40.080 --> 37:41.339
What do we do?

37:41.340 --> 37:44.539
First of all, whatever
we can to get her out.

37:44.540 --> 37:47.089
- After that...
- Mr. Hodges.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.839
Yeah?

37:48.840 --> 37:49.849
Sorry to intrude.

37:49.850 --> 37:51.919
I just wanted to say a quick thank you.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.159
My name's Morris Bellamy.

37:53.160 --> 37:55.219
I was at the jobs fair that night...

37:55.220 --> 37:57.119
one of the lucky ones.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.609
Hello.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.160
Hi.

38:01.170 --> 38:04.639
So many of us are so
grateful to both of you.

38:04.640 --> 38:07.779
And I'm not sure it
gets said quite enough,

38:07.780 --> 38:09.279
so I thought I'd say it.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.519
- Thank you.
- Thank you, both of you.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.960
Again, sorry to intrude.

38:17.480 --> 38:19.710
Wait just a second.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.660
You were one of Brady
Hartsfield's victims?

38:27.540 --> 38:30.659
Well, emotionally.

38:30.660 --> 38:32.939
I escaped physical harm.

38:32.940 --> 38:34.979
Thank God.

38:34.980 --> 38:38.139
Where's your head at on this?

38:38.140 --> 38:39.339
I'm sorry?

38:39.340 --> 38:40.559
This trial. Do you want to see

38:40.560 --> 38:42.863
Lou Linklatter convicted or set free?

38:45.470 --> 38:48.539
Lou Linklatter's a hero in my book.

38:58.620 --> 39:01.489
Did you have an opportunity
to speak with her after?

39:01.490 --> 39:02.499
I did.

39:02.500 --> 39:05.359
And did she tell you where she
procured the 3-D revolver?

39:05.360 --> 39:06.759
She told me she made it herself.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.012
Is that easy to do?

39:08.013 --> 39:09.338
No. There's a fair amount

39:09.339 --> 39:11.199
of engineering expertise involved.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.259
Premeditation.

39:12.260 --> 39:15.059
Coherent thinking. Malice aforethought.

39:15.060 --> 39:17.819
That was all part of the
mix of what you observed,

39:17.820 --> 39:19.119
was it not, Mr. Montez?

39:19.120 --> 39:21.979
- Objection, foundation.
- Lay opinion.

39:21.980 --> 39:23.194
Move it along.

39:24.420 --> 39:27.979
As you observed the defendant
shoot Brady Hartsfield,

39:27.980 --> 39:29.899
she appeared to be acting calmly,

39:29.900 --> 39:31.411
willfully, and with purpose?

39:31.412 --> 39:32.459
Appeared to be the case.

39:32.460 --> 39:35.539
And was Brady Hartsfield
posing a threat to anybody

39:35.540 --> 39:39.119
when Lou Linklatter
acted to end his life?

39:39.120 --> 39:40.779
No.

39:40.780 --> 39:42.629
She executed him.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.699
Appeared to be the case.

39:44.700 --> 39:46.580
Thank you, Mr. Montez.

39:55.640 --> 39:57.259
You swore to tell the truth.

39:57.260 --> 39:59.219
I did.

39:59.220 --> 40:03.079
But you have an even higher obligation

40:03.080 --> 40:04.179
to tell it, don't you?

40:04.180 --> 40:07.349
You're a prosecutor,
an officer of the court.

40:07.350 --> 40:09.532
My obligation is the same
as any other witness.

40:09.533 --> 40:11.579
As an Ohio prosecutor,

40:11.580 --> 40:14.787
do you know and understand
Ohio criminal law?

40:14.788 --> 40:16.529
Well, that would be the goal.

40:16.530 --> 40:19.159
Before the shooting, would you say

40:19.160 --> 40:22.819
Brady Hartsfield seriously
provoked my client?

40:22.820 --> 40:25.059
Not in court, not on that day.

40:25.060 --> 40:26.699
In the months leading up to the event,

40:26.700 --> 40:28.899
when he attacked her,
when he almost killed her,

40:28.900 --> 40:31.219
almost killed thousands of people,

40:31.220 --> 40:33.264
would you say he provoked her?

40:34.620 --> 40:36.179
That's fair.

40:36.180 --> 40:40.239
Did his provocation cause my client

40:40.240 --> 40:41.719
to suffer great mental

40:41.720 --> 40:43.879
or emotional distress, if you know?

40:43.880 --> 40:45.819
Cause her to fear for her life?

40:45.820 --> 40:49.289
Cause her to lose sleep, weight,

40:49.290 --> 40:51.189
hopes...

40:51.190 --> 40:54.819
I can't argue with any of that.

40:57.900 --> 41:00.749
A person in Ohio can't be convicted

41:00.750 --> 41:03.961
of both murder and manslaughter
for the same killing.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.879
No. It's one or the other.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.409
Because not all killings are the same.

41:07.410 --> 41:08.925
Murder is worse than manslaughter.

41:08.930 --> 41:12.999
When you saw my client
shoot Mr. Mercedes,

41:13.000 --> 41:16.919
did you think to yourself,
"That woman is a murderer"?

41:16.920 --> 41:19.515
I'm not sure I was thinking
about it in those terms.

41:19.516 --> 41:21.479
Well, you're a trained prosecutor.

41:21.480 --> 41:23.310
You must've had some
opinion, some reaction.

41:23.314 --> 41:26.775
- Objection.
- Sustained.

41:26.776 --> 41:29.499
Seeing a man killed is upsetting.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.899
- It is.
- So is testifying.

41:31.900 --> 41:34.699
Upsetting, scary, nerve-racking...

41:34.700 --> 41:36.079
for everybody, even you.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.359
You... you're not enjoying this.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.829
No.

41:40.830 --> 41:45.139
Did you know how having
to give testimony

41:45.140 --> 41:46.670
would affect her that day?

41:49.120 --> 41:52.170
I didn't realize the extent, no.

41:52.177 --> 41:55.249
Do you make room for the
possibility, Mr. Montez,

41:55.250 --> 41:58.019
that having been assaulted
by Brady Hartsfield,

41:58.020 --> 42:00.559
nearly killed by him in
the most vicious way,

42:00.560 --> 42:03.429
being stabbed in the stomach, and then

42:03.430 --> 42:06.779
having to be in a room with
him to face him down...

42:06.780 --> 42:08.819
do you make room for
the possibility that

42:08.820 --> 42:13.199
it was just all too much
for Lou Linklatter?

42:13.200 --> 42:14.860
Is it possible?

42:17.710 --> 42:20.440
Of course it's possible.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.470
Thank you.

42:27.590 --> 42:30.879
Calm, coherent,

42:30.880 --> 42:32.719
deliberate, reflective,

42:32.720 --> 42:34.339
with malice aforethought.

42:34.340 --> 42:36.387
You still stand by that testimony?

42:38.580 --> 42:41.500
- I do.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

42:46.050 --> 42:47.839
What do you think?

42:47.840 --> 42:50.359
I don't know.

42:50.360 --> 42:52.649
It's close.

42:52.650 --> 42:54.364
Could be bad.

42:55.550 --> 42:58.020
It's hard to be objective.

42:59.660 --> 43:02.840
My testimony could be very important.

43:09.460 --> 43:11.320
You like him, don't you?

43:12.110 --> 43:14.049
What?

43:14.050 --> 43:16.761
Finkelstein. You like him.

43:22.260 --> 43:23.889
I do.

43:23.890 --> 43:26.999
What do you think of him?

43:27.000 --> 43:29.530
He seems good.

44:04.420 --> 44:07.679
I think it went as well as we can hope.

44:10.360 --> 44:13.759
But you want me to plead.

44:13.760 --> 44:16.239
Well, I'm not saying...

44:16.240 --> 44:18.269
We're gonna win.

44:19.820 --> 44:21.149
I know it.

44:21.150 --> 44:24.719
Is that what he's telling you?

44:24.720 --> 44:27.749
'Cause he's misled you before.

44:29.440 --> 44:32.160
He's a very complicated person.

44:32.170 --> 44:34.679
He really is.

44:34.680 --> 44:37.879
He hurts me, and then he helps me,

44:37.880 --> 44:40.261
and then he hurts me.

44:42.300 --> 44:45.475
All I gotta do is know
which one is which.

44:49.440 --> 44:50.839
You made contact?

44:50.840 --> 44:53.639
Both with him and the
woman, Holly Gibney.

44:53.640 --> 44:55.779
Step one. Mission accomplished.

44:55.780 --> 44:56.979
Excellent.

44:56.980 --> 44:59.499
What about you and the Saubers mother?

44:59.500 --> 45:01.039
Contact also established.

45:01.040 --> 45:03.179
Minimal, but progress.

45:03.180 --> 45:06.913
I'll get inside that family.
It's only a matter of time.

45:06.914 --> 45:08.519
I can tell you this.

45:08.520 --> 45:11.959
She's freaked about something,
and it wasn't my lost cat.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.159
Where are you now?

45:13.160 --> 45:14.499
Doing a little spring cleaning

45:14.500 --> 45:17.090
on the chance the police
come sniffing my way.

45:17.100 --> 45:19.659
Gotta make sure there's
nothing for 'em to find.

45:19.660 --> 45:22.039
Why would they be coming your way?

45:22.040 --> 45:24.259
Hopefully, they won't.

45:24.260 --> 45:27.139
But, Morris, we both
entered into the mix.

45:27.140 --> 45:29.379
And that composite they released...

45:29.380 --> 45:31.419
didn't look a whole lot like you,

45:31.420 --> 45:33.689
but I'm not taking any chances.

45:33.690 --> 45:36.442
Your bookstore buddy
could connect the dots.

45:36.443 --> 45:38.439
True.
