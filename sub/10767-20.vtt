00:03.613 --> 00:04.887
Hey, my brother.

00:05.053 --> 00:07.806
I just came back from the free clinic,
and guess what I got?

00:08.453 --> 00:10.205
What, man?

00:10.933 --> 00:12.924
The phone number
of those two nurses we met.

00:13.373 --> 00:15.284
Yo, the twins that sleep
in the same bed?

00:15.453 --> 00:17.762
With some luck,
we can put an end to that streak.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.366
You the man.

00:19.533 --> 00:22.252
Oh, hey, Phillipe,
I need you to cover my next shift.

00:23.093 --> 00:26.972
Actually, cover my next three shifts.
You know how demanding twins can be.

00:27.133 --> 00:29.249
Yes, my brother,
it's gonna be some night.

00:29.413 --> 00:31.688
Oh, wait.
I just remembered, I can't go.

00:31.853 --> 00:33.969
- Well, why not?
- I'm getting married.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

01:44.093 --> 01:45.924
What do you mean,
you're getting married?

01:46.093 --> 01:47.367
Her name is Jewel Robertson.

01:47.533 --> 01:50.843
<i>I saw her on Cops,
getting busted for grand theft auto.</i>

01:51.813 --> 01:53.565
Jazz, the woman's a convict?

01:53.733 --> 01:56.611
We prefer the term
"freedom impaired."

01:57.173 --> 02:00.370
How about the term
"not playing with a full cell block"?

02:01.253 --> 02:02.766
You don't understand, man.

02:02.933 --> 02:05.163
Jewel makes my life complete.

02:05.333 --> 02:10.122
See, I know you look at me and you say,
"Damn, that Jazz has it all."

02:10.293 --> 02:14.730
But the truth is, behind these shades,
there's a big, empty hole.

02:16.813 --> 02:19.008
Well, that's for damn sure.

02:20.013 --> 02:22.686
And I was gonna make you
my best man.

02:23.053 --> 02:25.726
Oh, really? Your best man?

02:25.893 --> 02:28.088
Well, you are my best friend.

02:28.253 --> 02:30.483
My other friends pretend to like me
for my money.

02:30.773 --> 02:32.764
That's because you owe it to them.

02:33.733 --> 02:37.521
The ceremony's at the Woman's
Correctional Institution next Tuesday.

02:37.693 --> 02:41.447
Whoa, Jazz.
You're getting married at the prison?

02:41.613 --> 02:44.081
Why not. It's free.

02:45.213 --> 02:47.249
We follow an execution.

02:47.413 --> 02:52.123
Jazz, ain't no homey of mine
getting married up in no prison.

02:52.293 --> 02:56.081
Well, unless you got a rich uncle
or something, that's how it's got to be.

03:09.733 --> 03:14.363
There she is, Jewel Robertson,
number 54820 out of Folsom Prison.

03:14.533 --> 03:17.093
Crime, grand theft auto.
Time served, two years.

03:17.253 --> 03:19.847
Let's take a look at the videotape.

03:20.173 --> 03:22.528
<i>Officer down. Officer down.
We need backup.</i>

03:22.693 --> 03:25.253
<i>Get her off of me. She's biting my...</i>

03:28.613 --> 03:32.049
Has Jazz lost his mind? I mean, woof.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.602
What's wrong with her face?

03:34.773 --> 03:37.412
Sweetheart,
it's electronically scrambled.

03:40.933 --> 03:44.084
Whatever. I just hope she's not
toying with Jazz's emotions.

03:44.253 --> 03:46.562
I hate to see a sweet guy like that
get hurt.

03:49.573 --> 03:53.452
Honey, up till today, you've never had
a nice thing to say about Jazz.

03:53.613 --> 03:56.525
Up till today, Jazz was available.

03:56.693 --> 03:58.172
Now that he's getting married...

03:58.333 --> 04:01.245
...well, forbidden fruit always looks
more tempting, doesn't it?

04:01.413 --> 04:04.803
Mother, for God's sake,
he's half your age.

04:08.013 --> 04:11.244
Well, I'm happy for Jazz.
I think it is so romantic.

04:11.413 --> 04:14.052
- I give it three weeks.
- The marriage or her parole?

04:16.373 --> 04:19.125
Yo, whoa, hey, that's not funny.
Jazz is my best friend.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.409
Was. Be prepared, Will.

04:21.572 --> 04:23.450
Marriage brings about new priorities.

04:23.613 --> 04:26.969
You may find Jazz has less time to spend
with you once he's taken a wife.

04:27.133 --> 04:31.445
Please, ain't no way Jazz, knowing me,
gonna let some honey come between us.

04:31.613 --> 04:32.887
That's what I thought too.

04:33.053 --> 04:36.250
When I married Vivian,
I lost all my friends. Right, honey?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.331
But, you know...

04:41.493 --> 04:43.370
But it wasn't like
I was gonna need them.

04:45.453 --> 04:48.013
After all, I wasn't gonna have
any fun anymore.

04:50.493 --> 04:53.326
Honey. Sweetheart.

04:53.813 --> 04:55.087
Babe...

04:55.253 --> 04:59.451
Man, Uncle Phil, I knew you had
a man-size appetite, but both feet?

05:00.853 --> 05:03.321
Don't worry, Daddy,
I'll run damage control.

05:03.533 --> 05:04.682
Thank you, baby.

05:04.853 --> 05:07.413
Hey, well, look, I don't even care.
Jazz is in love...

05:07.573 --> 05:10.371
...and I'm gonna make sure
that he has the best wedding ever.

05:10.533 --> 05:12.842
Even if I got to pay for it myself.

05:15.613 --> 05:18.844
I mean, even though I am just...

05:19.013 --> 05:22.050
...a poor black man
trying to get my education.

05:23.973 --> 05:26.965
Forget it, Will.
I am not shelling out for Jazz's wedding.

05:27.573 --> 05:31.964
Oh, please. Now, I seem to remember a
rather large relative of mine saying that:

05:32.133 --> 05:35.762
"If Jazz would just find some bimbo
to get his mind off of Hilary...

05:35.933 --> 05:38.891
...I'd be more than happy
to pay for the wedding."

05:39.053 --> 05:40.805
Well...

05:40.973 --> 05:43.646
Way to go, Judge Banks.
You pretend to uphold the law...

05:43.813 --> 05:45.724
...but you'll renege
on a verbal contract?

05:45.933 --> 05:49.562
Well... Well, she is a convict.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.964
I could call it a rehabilitation party
and write it off.

05:53.373 --> 05:54.692
Check it out, you're a judge.

05:54.853 --> 05:57.083
You can perform the ceremony.
Pay yourself 25 bucks.

05:57.253 --> 05:59.813
- Fifty.
- Pay yourself 100. It's your money.

05:59.973 --> 06:01.452
That's right.

06:06.853 --> 06:10.766
I finally found the man of my dreams.

06:11.853 --> 06:14.321
Marry me, Carlton.

06:20.253 --> 06:21.527
Very funny, Will.

06:21.693 --> 06:24.765
But while you're playing with dolls,
I'll be securing the premises.

06:24.933 --> 06:27.208
I mean, we are gonna have
a convict in the house.

06:29.733 --> 06:31.769
Jazz, would you relax, man.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.572
Can't help myself, Will.
Not with Jewel due any minute.

06:34.733 --> 06:36.724
Oh, is she pregnant too?

06:38.173 --> 06:39.492
Of course not.

06:39.653 --> 06:41.723
I have the deepest respect for her,
Mr. Banks.

06:41.893 --> 06:43.326
She's a class act.

06:43.493 --> 06:45.643
Somebody wants to know
where the bride is registered.

06:45.813 --> 06:47.849
Gillespie Liquors.

06:50.213 --> 06:53.205
She's here. She's here. She's here.

06:56.933 --> 06:59.049
Carlton.

07:00.373 --> 07:03.763
I also put my diamond cuff links
in a balloon and swallowed them.

07:04.973 --> 07:07.931
That's more than I ever wanted
to know about you, Carlton.

07:08.093 --> 07:10.448
Okay, everybody just relax.

07:11.733 --> 07:15.043
Well, hi there, Mr. Man.

07:18.173 --> 07:19.572
You like my dress?

07:20.173 --> 07:22.892
Hilary, will you get out of my way?
You're blocking my view.

07:24.533 --> 07:27.001
Miss Jewel Robertson.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.167
- Jazzy!
- Munchkin!

07:34.493 --> 07:38.884
There's a lot to be said for a woman
who's been in prison a long time.

07:40.853 --> 07:42.445
Hey.

07:43.573 --> 07:45.325
Yo.

07:46.853 --> 07:49.447
Hello in there.

07:50.453 --> 07:52.444
Munchkin,
these are the lovely people...

07:52.613 --> 07:55.081
...who have opened their home
and their wallet to us.

07:55.253 --> 07:57.244
Hey, I'm Will, the best man.

07:57.413 --> 08:00.610
Oh, yeah? As far as I can see,
this here's the best man.

08:00.773 --> 08:02.491
I love this bony butt.

08:03.613 --> 08:06.047
And it loves you too, my pet.

08:06.213 --> 08:08.169
Carlton Banks here.

08:08.333 --> 08:12.690
I suppose you noticed our fine collection
of European autos in our driveway.

08:12.853 --> 08:15.606
I also noticed
you have a very small head.

08:15.773 --> 08:17.365
Hey.

08:18.213 --> 08:19.487
Don't mind him.

08:19.653 --> 08:21.564
We are very happy
to have you in our home.

08:21.733 --> 08:24.486
Thanks, and I guess
it's true what they say:

08:24.653 --> 08:27.486
- Can't buy good taste.
- Hey.

08:27.653 --> 08:31.009
Which one is the desperately stuck-up,
self-centered clothes horse?

08:31.173 --> 08:33.243
Guilty.

08:33.413 --> 08:36.644
- Now, just a minute, young lady.
- I'm sorry.

08:36.813 --> 08:40.010
See, the prison therapist says
that I should say what's on my mind...

08:40.173 --> 08:42.812
...and not keep too much bottled up,
otherwise I'd...

08:42.972 --> 08:47.251
...you know, go out and do something
stupid like hotwiring a Lexus.

08:47.413 --> 08:49.927
Although it did get me on prime time.

08:50.693 --> 08:53.651
And kept you in the hearts
of viewers everywhere.

08:54.213 --> 08:56.852
I just wanna say,
if you ever hurt him...

08:57.013 --> 08:59.846
...I'll hunt you down
like the dog that you are, and kill you.

09:02.613 --> 09:05.047
Well, gotta go shop for your present.

09:06.573 --> 09:08.291
Beautiful and nuts.

09:08.453 --> 09:11.490
- You must be very proud.
- I guess.

09:11.653 --> 09:13.962
Well, hey, look, I've got an idea.

09:14.133 --> 09:17.569
Jazz, why don't you take Jewel
into the kitchen and get her some grub.

09:17.773 --> 09:20.492
That's if tubby here
hasn't eaten it all.

09:33.653 --> 09:36.167
Come in.
Just trying on my wedding dress.

09:36.333 --> 09:39.006
Hey, Jewel, I just wanted
to come and check...

09:39.173 --> 09:41.084
...to see if there's anything
you needed.

09:41.253 --> 09:44.051
You know, a cup of coffee,
a blood test.

09:45.013 --> 09:47.925
Actually, I thought I'd see
if you could live up to your title.

09:48.093 --> 09:50.653
You know, best man.

09:50.813 --> 09:53.771
- Oh, what did you have in mind?
- Could you help me with this?

09:53.933 --> 09:55.207
It's already zipped up.

09:56.093 --> 09:59.324
I know. I want you to zip it down.

10:09.733 --> 10:12.122
I don't think that's a good idea.

10:12.293 --> 10:14.682
Listen, my cousin Hilary
is right down the hall.

10:14.853 --> 10:16.684
- I'm gonna get her.
- Quit messing around.

10:16.853 --> 10:20.004
Come on, I gotta take a shower
and do my hair. Now, hurry up.

10:26.653 --> 10:28.723
You know...

10:28.893 --> 10:33.011
...if somebody was to
walk in here right now...

10:36.653 --> 10:39.850
...they might think
you was hitting on me.

10:40.013 --> 10:44.131
Trust me, if I was hitting on you,
you'd know it.

10:46.773 --> 10:49.241
Really? How?

10:54.413 --> 10:56.802
Okay, you made your point.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.688
Uncle Phil, you busy?

11:07.853 --> 11:10.048
What's on your mind, Will?

11:12.613 --> 11:14.205
Jewel kissed me.

11:14.733 --> 11:17.645
- It's customary to kiss the bride.
- No, no, no.

11:17.813 --> 11:21.931
<i>Uncle Phil, this was like one of them
Fatal Attraction elevator-scene kisses.</i>

11:22.093 --> 11:24.766
You know what I'm saying?
You know?

11:24.933 --> 11:26.969
Oh, come on,
you're exaggerating, Will.

11:27.133 --> 11:28.885
Listen, Uncle Phil, I'm telling you.

11:29.053 --> 11:31.442
I went up to the room to see
if she needed anything.

11:31.613 --> 11:33.205
She kissed me on my lips.

11:33.373 --> 11:35.523
She jumped on me
and she was stuck on me.

11:35.693 --> 11:37.968
And I was trying to shake her off,
but I couldn't.

11:38.133 --> 11:42.092
She was like
a little naked Velcro midget.

11:44.853 --> 11:46.571
What am I gonna do, Uncle Phil?

11:46.733 --> 11:50.169
Guess you've only got two choices.
You can either tell Jazz or not.

11:50.333 --> 11:52.563
And you're a judge, right?

11:53.973 --> 11:55.725
Look, maybe this story will help you.

11:55.893 --> 11:59.249
You know, when I was younger,
I was a pretty sexy guy.

11:59.413 --> 12:02.086
If you're not gonna take
this seriously, Uncle Phil...

12:04.333 --> 12:07.052
Do you wanna hear this story?

12:10.333 --> 12:13.689
Okay. I was driving home from a party
with my buddy and his girlfriend...

12:13.853 --> 12:15.445
...and my buddy fell asleep.

12:15.613 --> 12:18.571
Next thing I know, she leans across...

12:18.733 --> 12:21.293
...and fastens my seat belt.

12:23.213 --> 12:24.612
You know what I'm saying?

12:26.733 --> 12:28.963
Please don't do that, Uncle Phil.

12:30.613 --> 12:32.092
Sorry.

12:33.093 --> 12:36.563
Anyway, I figured that our friendship
was strong enough to stand the truth.

12:36.733 --> 12:39.167
So we went out for a beer
and I told him everything.

12:39.333 --> 12:40.732
Well, did he thank you?

12:40.893 --> 12:44.169
Oh, yeah.
With a bar stool, on the head.

12:45.093 --> 12:47.971
Well, I mean,
Jazz ain't the violent type...

12:48.133 --> 12:49.885
...I don't think.

12:50.053 --> 12:54.604
Well, the point is, to be a good friend,
you have to risk losing a good friend.

12:57.093 --> 13:00.085
- I think I know what I gotta do.
- What's that?

13:00.493 --> 13:03.326
I gotta find somebody else
to talk to about this.

13:08.373 --> 13:10.523
Hey, Jazz.

13:11.453 --> 13:12.647
How's it going, man?

13:12.813 --> 13:15.691
How's it going?
This is the best day of my life.

13:15.853 --> 13:17.764
Did I thank you
for everything you've done?

13:18.453 --> 13:20.409
Well, not everything.

13:21.613 --> 13:24.047
I hope you two will be close.

13:24.213 --> 13:26.204
She touched me, Will.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.648
And I know she'll touch you too.

13:30.813 --> 13:34.408
Yeah, actually, Jazz, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

13:34.573 --> 13:37.371
- See, listen, last night...
- She told you about our decision?

13:37.933 --> 13:41.084
- What decision?
- The one we made last night.

13:41.253 --> 13:43.244
We're gonna have 10 kids.

13:43.853 --> 13:45.844
One for every month of the year.

13:47.613 --> 13:49.922
But we gonna name them
all after you.

13:51.253 --> 13:54.006
Jazz, hey, you ain't
got to do that, man.

13:54.173 --> 13:57.051
Okay, then, we'll name them Earl.

13:58.493 --> 14:01.087
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's cool, Jazz.

14:01.253 --> 14:05.132
See, me and Jewel,
we got this crazy dream.

14:05.293 --> 14:08.365
We gonna keep our kids
out of reform school.

14:09.573 --> 14:12.371
- Listen, Jazz, what l...
- See, Will...

14:12.533 --> 14:15.525
...I don't know how long
this happiness is gonna last.

14:16.413 --> 14:18.643
If it's for just one day...

14:19.293 --> 14:21.761
...it's more
than I've ever known before.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.968
So, what did you want
to talk to me about?

14:26.693 --> 14:28.649
Oh, I just wanted to thank you...

14:28.813 --> 14:32.249
...for picking out these lovely
yellow-and-green ensembles.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.812
You're welcome.

14:39.293 --> 14:43.002
Cell block 41 has arrived.

14:48.293 --> 14:50.170
Welcome, ladies.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.801
Please take a moment
to sign our guest book.

14:54.333 --> 14:57.006
And now,
if I can just have your thumb.

14:58.893 --> 15:02.329
You know, I resent being treated
like a common thief.

15:02.733 --> 15:05.327
Oh, you do, do you?

15:05.493 --> 15:09.406
Well, what kind of cold-hearted,
vicious, evil crime did you commit?

15:09.573 --> 15:11.211
Securities fraud.

15:11.613 --> 15:15.242
Really? An inside trader?

15:15.613 --> 15:18.332
So are you here alone?

15:19.893 --> 15:23.090
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you'd all please take your seats.

15:23.653 --> 15:27.692
And I wanna thank you
for attending this wonderful occasion.

15:28.773 --> 15:30.843
It's a pretty nice turnout,
huh, Uncle Phil?

15:31.013 --> 15:34.449
Are you kidding? Jazz ain't got
no friends. I hired these people.

15:35.133 --> 15:37.044
Ashley.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.927
- Dearly beloved...
- Stop the wedding!

16:01.093 --> 16:02.685
You can't marry her, Jazz.

16:03.293 --> 16:05.204
We're not cousins, are we?

16:06.733 --> 16:09.611
- Hilary, what's the meaning of this?
- I'm in love with him.

16:11.413 --> 16:14.086
Oh, my God. What am I saying?

16:16.253 --> 16:18.642
I'm gonna go lie down.

16:23.813 --> 16:25.565
May I continue?

16:26.093 --> 16:30.086
We are gathered together to join
this man and this woman in matrimony.

16:30.253 --> 16:33.131
If there's anyone who knows
why they should not be together...

16:33.293 --> 16:35.727
...let them speak now,
or forever hold their peace.

16:42.053 --> 16:43.850
Some friend you are.

16:44.013 --> 16:46.732
I'm sorry, Jazzy,
we can't get married.

16:46.893 --> 16:48.770
- Munchkin.
- Jazz.

16:48.933 --> 16:51.003
Freeze!

16:53.933 --> 16:56.766
Munchkin, please.
What about all our guests?

16:56.933 --> 16:59.083
And all the gifts?

16:59.453 --> 17:03.082
I ain't never owned anything
that still had the serial number on it.

17:04.012 --> 17:07.368
- Jazzy, I'm sorry, it just wouldn't work.
- Will.

17:07.532 --> 17:09.683
- See if you could talk to her.
- Jazz, I can't.

17:09.853 --> 17:12.127
For little Earl's sake.

17:16.173 --> 17:20.484
Listen, Jewel, you cannot
do this to Jazz. Marry him.

17:20.653 --> 17:23.929
Okay, you guys can just leave
the state and put me behind you.

17:24.093 --> 17:26.448
- Will, I can't.
- You have to.

17:26.613 --> 17:30.322
No, really, I can't, I'm on parole,
I'm not allowed to leave the state.

17:32.893 --> 17:35.361
Damn these good looks of mine.

17:37.533 --> 17:39.967
Listen, now, Jewel...

17:40.133 --> 17:42.203
...I know it's hard, okay?

17:42.373 --> 17:46.685
But you got to look beyond
this charming, sexy exterior, okay?

17:46.853 --> 17:49.242
You got to see the real Will Smith.

17:49.413 --> 17:52.211
I'm irresponsible, I'm unreliable,
I'm immature.

17:52.373 --> 17:55.251
- Egotistical, self-centered.
- Yeah, yeah, that's it.

17:55.413 --> 17:58.883
- Conceited, thick-headed, spoiled.
- Okay, that's fine.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.813
And on top of that,
you ain't even that good-looking.

18:06.013 --> 18:07.605
Then why you want me so bad?

18:07.773 --> 18:09.365
I don't want you.

18:09.533 --> 18:12.172
I only came on to you
because I figured you'd tell Jazz...

18:12.333 --> 18:14.051
...and he'd call the whole thing off.

18:14.213 --> 18:16.090
But you couldn't even do that.

18:17.213 --> 18:18.487
I kissed you for nothing.

18:21.893 --> 18:23.611
Well, damn.

18:25.293 --> 18:30.845
Will, I've never met anybody
who cares for me as much as Jazz does.

18:31.013 --> 18:35.609
You know, whenever we go
to a nice restaurant, he carries my tray.

18:38.293 --> 18:40.443
And when it's time
to skip out on the check...

18:40.613 --> 18:43.844
...he always holds open
the bathroom window for me.

18:44.773 --> 18:46.843
Well, that's Jazz for you.

18:48.453 --> 18:50.284
Can't you see?

18:50.453 --> 18:53.013
I don't deserve a man like him.

18:53.573 --> 18:55.848
I mean, look what he's done for me.

18:56.413 --> 18:58.643
Beautiful wedding gown...

18:58.813 --> 19:01.646
...getting married
in a Bel-Air mansion.

19:02.973 --> 19:04.804
Do you know
where my mama was married?

19:05.413 --> 19:06.528
No, where?

19:06.693 --> 19:09.082
I don't know. I was hoping you did.

19:14.013 --> 19:17.608
Jewel, believe me when I tell you,
you and Jazz are made for each other.

19:17.773 --> 19:20.412
Listen, trust me,
I've known Jazz a long time...

19:20.573 --> 19:23.531
...and you are the best thing
to ever happen to him.

19:24.973 --> 19:26.884
Will, I'm scared.

19:27.853 --> 19:30.083
What if it doesn't work out?

19:31.293 --> 19:34.524
- It will.
- But what if it doesn't?

19:35.813 --> 19:37.405
It will.

19:45.333 --> 19:48.405
- But what if it doesn't?
- It will!

19:48.693 --> 19:50.809
Now get in there and marry that boy.

19:51.653 --> 19:53.132
Thanks.

19:54.453 --> 19:57.206
Okay, let's get a shot
of the bridesmaids.

20:04.533 --> 20:07.445
Okay, we're back. We're back.
Everything's okay.

20:07.613 --> 20:11.128
Bride just got a little nervous,
but who wouldn't, marrying Jazz?

20:11.293 --> 20:12.612
May I continue?

20:12.773 --> 20:14.889
- Please do.
- Good.

20:15.053 --> 20:18.523
The bride and groom
have prepared their own vows. Jazz.

20:21.693 --> 20:24.844
You're one jewel I never wanna hock.

20:26.413 --> 20:30.122
Sometimes I wanna bite you
to see if you're really real.

20:31.093 --> 20:34.688
If love was craps, you'd be a seven.

20:34.853 --> 20:36.286
If it was on the first roll.

20:37.693 --> 20:41.572
But if it was on the second roll,
and the point was six, you'd be a six.

20:43.453 --> 20:45.011
No, actually, you'd be a nine.

20:45.173 --> 20:48.404
I'd play the field on the second roll,
make a couple of extra bucks.

20:48.573 --> 20:52.327
Then you'd be a six on the third roll,
and then I'd clean up.

20:53.173 --> 20:54.652
You know what I'm trying to say.

20:54.813 --> 20:57.532
I love you,
and you make me feel lucky.

20:59.493 --> 21:01.927
And now, Jewel.

21:07.293 --> 21:10.888
I love you, Jazzy,
and I wanna be with you always.

21:11.053 --> 21:13.851
Thank you for setting
this little jailbird free...

21:14.013 --> 21:16.322
...body, mind and spirit.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.649
Baby, I love you.

21:19.253 --> 21:21.164
All right, all right, all right.

21:24.453 --> 21:27.923
Do you, Jazz, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

21:28.493 --> 21:30.563
Oh, yeah.

21:32.373 --> 21:35.888
Do you, Jewel, take this man
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

21:36.053 --> 21:38.123
Oh, yeah.

21:38.293 --> 21:42.605
By the powers vested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

21:43.853 --> 21:45.047
You may kiss the bride.

22:13.453 --> 22:15.011
Okay.

22:16.773 --> 22:18.286
Jewel. Jewel. Jewel.

22:18.453 --> 22:20.728
Jewel, get off me. Hey, Jewel.

22:20.893 --> 22:24.124
I ain't playing. Get off me, Jewel.

22:25.693 --> 22:28.048
Get off of me, Jewel.

22:39.173 --> 22:41.562
Okay, you made your point.
