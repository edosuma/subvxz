01:05.468 --> 01:06.830
Morning, beautiful.

01:10.766 --> 01:13.724
Course, I'll send someone up
as soon as I can, OK? Bye.

01:17.197 --> 01:18.218
You're very late,

01:18.983 --> 01:21.038
it's been crazy down here.
We've had a call.

01:21.569 --> 01:22.569
Sorry.

01:22.718 --> 01:23.718
Oh, God! Oh.

01:24.872 --> 01:25.979
Are you all right?

01:27.319 --> 01:28.340
Are you poorly?

01:28.489 --> 01:30.776
No, it's just, it's just a bad bra.

01:31.286 --> 01:34.227
It's the only one I had handy
this morning and it's really terrible,

01:34.375 --> 01:35.881
it's pinching into my sides

01:36.072 --> 01:38.115
and the straps
are digging into my shoulders.

01:38.277 --> 01:41.128
All that and it's not even
giving my breasts proper support!

01:41.554 --> 01:42.639
It's killing me.

01:44.660 --> 01:45.660
Oh, Moss.

01:49.158 --> 01:51.798
Oh, I'm sorry, are you OK?
- What happened?

01:51.926 --> 01:54.319
Sometimes I forget I'm not
just working with other women.

01:54.501 --> 01:56.816
No, it's my fault, I really ought
to be able to listen

01:56.986 --> 01:58.774
to a woman talking about bras without...

02:00.762 --> 02:03.783
Hello, good morning, here I am.
Here we go.

02:03.974 --> 02:07.418
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, the first time
I wasn't expecting you

02:07.673 --> 02:09.445
to start talking about bras and then,

02:09.925 --> 02:12.065
 the second time,
it just came as a bit of surprise

02:12.214 --> 02:13.724
to hear myself talking about them.

02:14.554 --> 02:16.128
It's been a rollercoaster.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.713
Why don't you just have
a lie down in there?

02:21.536 --> 02:22.643
Morning.

02:23.770 --> 02:24.792
Morning.

02:24.983 --> 02:26.260
God, I feel rough.

02:30.539 --> 02:31.560
Good stag?

02:31.752 --> 02:34.518
Yeah, you know, standard stag.

02:35.517 --> 02:38.236
I may have got a little bit drunk
towards the end there.

02:38.445 --> 02:41.021
Oh, well what kind of celebration

02:41.170 --> 02:43.734
would it be if you
didn't pass out at some point?

02:43.947 --> 02:46.101
Yeah, thank God nobody noticed.

02:47.685 --> 02:49.026
How do you know I passed out?

02:49.238 --> 02:52.334
I'm a bit psychic sometimes,
and I bet you came straight from

02:52.504 --> 02:53.903
the party as well, didn't you?

02:54.749 --> 02:57.366
Oh, that's easy, I'm wearing
the same clothes.

02:58.196 --> 03:00.174
Roy, I was trying to remember how

03:00.409 --> 03:03.106
that song goes, The Locomotion,
do you remember that song?

03:03.382 --> 03:05.302
- Yeah, course I remember.
- How's it go again?

03:05.472 --> 03:06.962
You know it, you must know it.

03:09.628 --> 03:10.744
No, no, no. It's -

03:20.213 --> 03:21.447
It is a funny song.

03:31.751 --> 03:33.113
- You all right there?
- Yep,

03:33.353 --> 03:34.430
it's just a bad bra.

03:34.587 --> 03:35.579
Right,

03:35.834 --> 03:36.940
I have got to go,

03:37.273 --> 03:38.882
heads of department meeting.

03:39.483 --> 03:42.666
After last week's fiasco,
 I need to make a good impression.

03:42.942 --> 03:44.623
We didn't think you'd believe us.

03:44.793 --> 03:46.985
If you'd just stopped
to think about it for one second

03:47.243 --> 03:49.071
you'd have realised that it wasn't true.

03:50.832 --> 03:52.172
I don't think that's true.

03:52.704 --> 03:55.917
With all due respect,
John, I am Head of IT.

03:56.619 --> 03:58.531
And I have it on good authority.

03:59.361 --> 04:00.595
If you type Google

04:01.467 --> 04:02.638
into Google,

04:03.255 --> 04:05.698
you can break the Internet,

04:06.017 --> 04:07.379
so please...

04:07.776 --> 04:09.138
... no-one try it,

04:09.785 --> 04:10.846
even for a joke.

04:14.550 --> 04:18.401
It's not a laughing matter,
you can break the Internet.

04:19.954 --> 04:22.836
You don't know what those meetings
are like, they are murder.

04:23.092 --> 04:26.092
It does you no harm to look a
little foolish from time to time.

04:26.664 --> 04:30.111
Roy, there's...
something I should let you know.

04:30.490 --> 04:31.533
What?

04:31.758 --> 04:33.321
Stephanie called earlier.

04:33.470 --> 04:35.623
Douglas needs someone
to take a look at his computer.

04:35.905 --> 04:37.681
No, no, no, no, no,
get Moss to do it.

04:37.873 --> 04:41.001
Oh, Moss isn't feeling too well
and besides, of the two of you,

04:41.469 --> 04:42.767
you're the expert.

04:49.553 --> 04:51.361
The Ordinary Boys,

04:52.191 --> 04:54.638
where do they get these crazy names?

04:56.036 --> 04:57.270
Entrare.

04:58.770 --> 05:00.578
I'm Roy, IT.

05:02.204 --> 05:04.661
My computer's,
my computer's broken...

05:05.597 --> 05:07.576
I have to say that's
a really wild look.

05:09.342 --> 05:12.252
You know, things are moving
just so fast, I can't keep up.

05:12.507 --> 05:14.890
First, The Ordinary Boys,
and now this.

05:16.922 --> 05:18.199
Should I check it out?

05:18.573 --> 05:19.680
Great, yeah.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.400
Let's get started, shall we?

05:25.687 --> 05:26.708
What?

05:26.836 --> 05:28.336
What needs my expertise?

05:28.931 --> 05:31.123
You did say you were
with IT, didn't you?

05:31.527 --> 05:32.697
Yeah.

05:33.909 --> 05:36.764
Come on, Mr Renow, while I'm down here.
I may as well get to work.

05:37.126 --> 05:39.937
OK, I'm gonna move over here.

05:41.597 --> 05:42.831
Sure.

05:44.774 --> 05:47.306
I can see where
you've been having problems.

05:47.694 --> 05:49.715
See, this isn't actually a computer.

05:49.928 --> 05:51.396
It's a brief case.

05:52.098 --> 05:54.009
- Excellent.
- I'll have one sent up.

06:00.795 --> 06:01.923
I admire you, Roy.

06:03.114 --> 06:05.497
You've got the guts to stand
up in what you believe in.

06:05.944 --> 06:07.880
OK, see you then.

06:11.453 --> 06:12.560
Good luck.

06:17.687 --> 06:19.508
Which means that we now have

06:19.635 --> 06:22.432
the cleanest toilets of any legal
department in London.

06:22.858 --> 06:23.858
Thank you.

06:24.390 --> 06:25.512
Well done, James,

06:25.657 --> 06:28.582
you managed to speak for eight minutes
without actually saying anything.

06:29.053 --> 06:30.406
I think that...
what.

06:30.704 --> 06:31.704
What?

06:32.123 --> 06:33.357
No, nothing.

06:34.761 --> 06:38.799
Who's next? Right, Jen, OK,
what's going on down in middle earth?

06:41.288 --> 06:44.792
Thank you, John, and,
prepare to be astonished

06:45.302 --> 06:47.252
because I have discovered four ways

06:47.401 --> 06:51.936
to increase our online visibility
without spending a single penny.

06:54.851 --> 06:56.029
Number one...

07:01.315 --> 07:02.410
Excuse me, sorry...

07:04.368 --> 07:05.588
Number one...

07:10.010 --> 07:11.500
Number one...

07:12.161 --> 07:13.237
You bloody thing.

07:13.386 --> 07:14.918
For God's sake!

07:16.468 --> 07:19.021
Bloody thing,
bloody pain in the arse.

07:25.849 --> 07:27.126
I'm a woman.

07:40.132 --> 07:41.936
<i>It's really pinching my sides,</i>

07:42.106 --> 07:44.255
<i>the straps are digging
into my shoulders.</i>

07:44.447 --> 07:47.188
<i>Eh, Moss, look, I'm a woman.</i>

07:48.200 --> 07:51.893
<i>And I love you, Moss, I love you.</i>

07:53.000 --> 07:54.957
<i>The straps are digging</i>
<i>into my shoulders.</i>

07:55.276 --> 07:57.276
<i>They're not giving my breasts
proper support,</i>

07:57.744 --> 08:00.342
<i>proper support, proper support.</i>

08:00.640 --> 08:01.896
Hang on a second.

08:03.832 --> 08:06.398
Hang on a second.

08:45.097 --> 08:46.395
I've done it.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.509
I've done it.

08:52.958 --> 08:54.727
- Hello.
- <i>Hello, Jen.</i>

08:56.605 --> 08:57.860
Who is this?

08:58.196 --> 08:59.792
<i>That's not important right now.</i>

09:02.074 --> 09:03.670
Well, it says Moss on my phone.

09:06.412 --> 09:07.901
<i>Yes, all right, it's me.</i>

09:08.926 --> 09:10.606
Why are you disguising your voice?

09:10.819 --> 09:13.351
<i>Because if someone is listening
in on this conversation,</i>

09:13.498 --> 09:15.647
<i>I don't want them to know
my identity.</i>

09:16.051 --> 09:17.349
But they know now.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.264
<i>Yes, thanks.</i>

09:20.198 --> 09:23.368
So why don't you use
your normal voice, now?

09:24.496 --> 09:27.028
<i>It's attached to the phone,
I'd have to hang up...</i>

09:27.153 --> 09:28.412
<i>Look, just listen to me.</i>

09:28.646 --> 09:30.406
Why don't you just
come in and speak to me?

09:30.757 --> 09:33.416
You're ruining...
You're ruining everything.

09:33.735 --> 09:35.097
What do you want, Moss?

09:35.799 --> 09:36.990
Take your top off, Jen.

09:38.813 --> 09:39.827
Sorry?

09:39.962 --> 09:41.813
You heard me, take your top off.

09:52.796 --> 09:55.146
- What's this all about anyway?
- You'll see.

09:55.822 --> 09:57.503
Is this another one
of your inventions?

09:58.227 --> 09:59.567
Maybe.

10:00.709 --> 10:02.879
What was the last one?
Oh, yeah.

10:03.305 --> 10:07.597
A ladder to help moths
escape from the bath.

10:08.439 --> 10:09.545
How's that useful?

10:09.758 --> 10:10.928
How's that not useful?

10:11.597 --> 10:13.214
Moths don't get stuck in baths.

10:13.491 --> 10:14.895
Yes, they do.

10:15.959 --> 10:17.406
Even if that were true,

10:18.247 --> 10:23.332
it's just not in their nature
to learn how to use a ladder.

10:24.672 --> 10:26.055
They have wings.

10:27.185 --> 10:31.057
When a moth thinks about
travelling vertically upwards,

10:32.627 --> 10:33.925
a ladder

10:34.840 --> 10:37.031
is just the last thing
they would think of.

10:38.733 --> 10:41.127
Moss, I don't like
to be negative about it, but...

10:41.403 --> 10:43.426
everything you invent is worthless.

10:43.936 --> 10:48.013
Ah, well, prepare to put mustard
on those words,

10:48.183 --> 10:49.800
for you will soon be consuming them,

10:50.141 --> 10:52.686
along with this slice of humble pie

10:53.026 --> 10:55.601
that comes direct
from the oven of shame

10:55.771 --> 10:58.090
set at gas mark egg-on-your-face.

11:02.398 --> 11:04.738
I sort of forget
what I was talking about.

11:05.837 --> 11:09.454
Ah, here's Jen. Oh, that's it,
it's a bra. I've made a brilliant bra.

11:10.751 --> 11:11.879
< How are ye?

11:12.305 --> 11:14.462
Is it, er, comfortable?

11:15.058 --> 11:18.795
This is possibly the most
comfortable bra I have ever worn.

11:19.944 --> 11:21.484
Donning clothes over a bad bra

11:21.633 --> 11:23.760
is like building a house
without laying a foundation.

11:23.888 --> 11:26.399
It's just a false economy
and an ill-fitting bra

11:26.590 --> 11:29.425
could well ruin your otherwise
painstakingly-selected ensemble.

11:30.345 --> 11:31.686
You really know your stuff.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.110
- Thank you.
- Google?

11:36.528 --> 11:39.442
Jen, Roy, bad bras are more
than just a nuisance,

11:39.751 --> 11:40.879
they're a menace.

11:42.027 --> 11:43.294
Years of wearing a bad bra

11:43.570 --> 11:45.665
can contribute to upper back
and shoulder pain.

11:45.899 --> 11:47.431
It can even lead to headaches.

11:48.431 --> 11:50.446
So what makes this bra different?.

11:50.659 --> 11:51.914
It can never go bad.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.319
What do you mean?

11:53.510 --> 11:56.194
Tiny elements of fissilca rub
together to prevent the fabric

11:56.343 --> 11:58.449
from resting too long
in any one position.

11:58.939 --> 12:00.343
It's a living bra.

12:01.567 --> 12:04.620
The effect would be rather like
having a large pair of man's hands

12:04.875 --> 12:06.343
holding the breasts in position.

12:07.904 --> 12:10.840
But the bra will go bad,
all bras go bad.

12:11.031 --> 12:14.563
Not this one, Jen. But don't take my
word for it, take it out for a spin.

12:15.095 --> 12:16.201
So what's it called?

12:16.456 --> 12:19.010
I call it the Abracada-bra!

12:24.029 --> 12:25.135
You are kidding me.

12:25.603 --> 12:27.623
- No.
- You're really going on Dragons' Den?

12:27.878 --> 12:31.166
I've got an interview today
with the producers at the BBC.

12:32.102 --> 12:35.102
Oh, that is just huge.
You're gonna be on telly.

12:35.315 --> 12:37.970
But you've got to keep
this under your respective hats

12:38.183 --> 12:40.842
so if anyone asks for me,
my name is Stephen Jennal.

12:41.204 --> 12:42.353
Why Stephen Jennal?

12:42.564 --> 12:44.925
If my calculations are correct,
this could be the only bra

12:45.074 --> 12:46.228
a woman need ever buy.

12:46.356 --> 12:49.365
Do you know what Playtexwould do to me
if they knew about the Abracada-bra?

12:49.501 --> 12:50.650
what would they do?

12:50.863 --> 12:51.970
They would kill me.

12:53.758 --> 12:55.779
I don't know
if they'd kill you, Moss.

12:55.949 --> 12:58.077
Playtex have changed
a lot over the last few years.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.508
Nonetheless,
I want complete secrecy on this one,

13:01.678 --> 13:04.963
so if anyone asks for me,
my name is Stephen Fennal.

13:05.516 --> 13:08.133
I chose Stephen Fennal
because it's easy to remember.

13:08.771 --> 13:12.527
Right. Except, well, you did
say Stephen Jennal earlier.

13:13.357 --> 13:16.208
Smoke and mirrors, Roy.
Is it Fennel? Is it Jennal?

13:16.378 --> 13:18.074
If I don't know, how will they?

13:19.393 --> 13:22.542
Who am I, Roy?
I'm a ghost. I'm a shadow. I'm gone.

13:27.450 --> 13:28.727
Hello, Moss speaking.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.161
Well done, good presentation.

13:34.416 --> 13:36.358
- Thanks, James.
- Jen, a word.

13:39.116 --> 13:41.542
Got Helen Bewley coming in tomorrow.
Do you know who she is?

13:41.712 --> 13:42.712
Of course I do.

13:42.925 --> 13:44.840
She's just been made
head of BHDR Industries,

13:45.095 --> 13:46.702
so obviously we need to make friends.

13:46.851 --> 13:50.062
I know, BHDR Industries,
they're the top makers of that product

13:50.254 --> 13:52.030
that has something
to do with our company.

13:52.158 --> 13:53.222
Exactly.

13:53.618 --> 13:55.209
I want you up front at that meeting.

13:55.380 --> 13:57.890
We can't have Helen going back
to BHDR saying Renham Industries

13:58.018 --> 13:59.182
is just a boys' club.

13:59.347 --> 14:01.011
- How does that sound?
- Sounds great.

14:01.182 --> 14:02.676
All right, see you tomorrow.

14:11.671 --> 14:12.796
Stephen Premmal?

14:13.285 --> 14:15.475
Oh, hello. Yeah, I'm Stephen Premmal.

14:16.387 --> 14:17.443
I think.

14:17.634 --> 14:18.885
You're very late. Quick.

14:21.370 --> 14:24.065
Hello, Stephen Premmel.
I'm afraid I'm very late.

14:26.107 --> 14:28.730
What exactly, um, is...?

14:31.840 --> 14:34.542
Gavin Briers here with
developments in North Korea.

14:34.989 --> 14:37.755
It's five years
since the war in Iraq began.

14:38.223 --> 14:41.655
The conflict rages on with
no hope of a solution in sight.

14:42.208 --> 14:43.676
I'm joined by Stephen Premmel,

14:43.910 --> 14:47.060
a spokesman for
the Ministry of Defence. Mr Premmel?

14:47.261 --> 14:48.835
Hello.

14:49.176 --> 14:52.495
Iraq is a gigantic
and bloody mess, isn't it?

14:53.090 --> 14:54.332
Yes.

14:58.407 --> 14:59.776
Well, how do you explain it?

14:59.970 --> 15:01.619
Well, we shouldn't have gone to war.

15:02.013 --> 15:04.141
You think the original
invasion was a mistake? >

15:04.372 --> 15:05.393
Oh, yes.

15:05.642 --> 15:07.684
I'm astonished you
should agree to this so readily

15:07.876 --> 15:09.940
when your department
must take a lot of the blame.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.072
What? We didn't do anything.

15:12.263 --> 15:14.497
You raised no objection
in the run up to the war.

15:16.584 --> 15:19.075
Yes, I did. I signed a petition.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.360
Sorry?

15:20.828 --> 15:23.547
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
When can I start talking about my bra?

15:29.123 --> 15:31.336
Jen, can you bring me
the prototype when you're ready?

15:31.549 --> 15:33.770
There are a couple
of glitches I need to iron out.

15:34.026 --> 15:36.175
Sure.
Guess who I'm about to meet now.

15:36.749 --> 15:38.217
Helen Bewley.

15:40.391 --> 15:42.923
Oh, come on. She took
that football team to court

15:43.072 --> 15:45.519
for institutional sexism,
won massive damages,

15:45.689 --> 15:47.992
and now she's Head CEO
at BHDR Industries.

15:48.268 --> 15:50.831
It's all right. I kinda switched off
after the word football.

15:52.837 --> 15:54.829
Did you see it? Is he in?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.137
Is he...?

16:02.535 --> 16:03.791
There I am,

16:04.642 --> 16:07.195
catching up with the news events
of the day,

16:07.706 --> 16:10.758
when who should appear
upon my television screen?

16:11.418 --> 16:13.397
It's only the Ministry of Defence.

16:14.875 --> 16:18.322
The news, Dragons' Den,
you're all over the schedules.

16:19.705 --> 16:23.257
I'm sorry, Moss, are you really sure
you're ready to go on Dragons' Den?

16:23.662 --> 16:25.236
Yes, it's a brilliant product.

16:25.959 --> 16:28.625
Don't get me wrong.
You have got the science down

16:28.816 --> 16:30.963
but it's all the other stuff,
isn't it?

16:31.325 --> 16:33.210
- What other stuff?
- OK, well...

16:33.678 --> 16:37.738
OK, well, let's say this staple
is science,

16:38.270 --> 16:39.589
you're good at this.

16:39.887 --> 16:41.612
What you're not so good at

16:42.633 --> 16:44.326
is everything else in the world.

16:45.815 --> 16:47.113
That's where I come in.

16:47.708 --> 16:49.724
I can help you
with all this other stuff,

16:49.936 --> 16:53.274
you know, give you some
tips on business and presentation,

16:53.466 --> 16:56.580
leaving you free
to concentrate on this.

16:57.346 --> 16:59.034
- What's in it for you?
- A cut.

17:00.052 --> 17:01.774
All right,
you're in for half a percent.

17:03.645 --> 17:05.142
25%.

17:05.929 --> 17:06.929
Half a percent.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.823
Deal.

17:10.770 --> 17:12.791
OK, first thing we need to do

17:12.941 --> 17:15.642
is buy the rights
for the word Abracada-bra.

17:15.829 --> 17:19.055
Agreed, but before that, we've got
to sort out the overheating problem.

17:19.374 --> 17:20.522
Overheating problem?

17:20.814 --> 17:24.324
Yes, it's got a very,
very, serious overheating problem.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.835
I'll have it sorted by next week.
Just need to get it back off Jen.

17:29.970 --> 17:32.395
Which has lead to significant gains

17:32.565 --> 17:36.912
in this area
and an overall yield of 22%.

17:37.614 --> 17:39.661
Thank you very much. Jen, is it?

17:40.512 --> 17:41.618
Yes, Miss Bewley.

17:42.214 --> 17:43.214
Please, Helen.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.990
As the only 2 women in the room, we can
dispense with formalities, don't you?

17:51.150 --> 17:53.673
Renham Industries has come a
long way in the past few years

17:53.837 --> 17:56.220
if a young woman like this
can blossom within its walls.

17:56.678 --> 17:59.351
I remember when the atmosphere here
here was a lot less conducive

17:59.478 --> 18:03.273
to what I can remember
one executive calling "working skirt".

18:03.719 --> 18:07.386
Yes. Well, I think we're all a little
older and a little wiser now, Helen.

18:07.705 --> 18:08.769
One would hope so.

18:12.111 --> 18:13.153
Are you OK, Jen?

18:14.409 --> 18:15.472
My tits.

18:19.585 --> 18:20.797
Oh, my tits are hot.

18:22.329 --> 18:23.648
They're really, really hot.

18:25.239 --> 18:26.729
Oh, my tits are on fire.

18:27.282 --> 18:28.559
Yep, my tits are on fire.

18:28.708 --> 18:32.076
They are on fire.
My tits are on fire!

18:33.009 --> 18:34.818
Oh, yeah! All right!

18:36.754 --> 18:38.122
- 40%.
- 20%.

18:38.356 --> 18:39.803
40.  40?!

18:39.994 --> 18:45.619
You owe me. Helen Bewley
has gone away thinking I was a stripper

18:46.300 --> 18:47.971
hired as a prank.

18:48.354 --> 18:50.588
But 40%, Jen, be reasonable.

18:50.758 --> 18:53.643
I have two black rings around here.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.239
I could sue you and get everything.

18:56.622 --> 18:58.539
- All right, all right.
- Good, thank you.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.975
Now, I can concentrate
on your presentation.

19:02.062 --> 19:04.168
- I'm doing presentation.
- Where did you get pizza?

19:04.690 --> 19:06.818
Some idiot left it in the toilet.

19:09.675 --> 19:11.654
I am doing presentation.

19:11.909 --> 19:15.544
No, hold on. Moss is my best friend,
and I'm damned if I'm...

19:15.693 --> 19:17.312
- Do something else.
- Like what?

19:17.440 --> 19:18.695
I don't know. Fitness.

19:19.866 --> 19:21.248
Fitness?!

19:22.113 --> 19:24.943
People do need to be fit
to go on Dragons' Den.

20:16.934 --> 20:19.275
Come on, Moss,
you're keeping the dragons waiting.

20:20.488 --> 20:22.126
Hey, Jen, Roy.

20:22.317 --> 20:23.563
You look amazing.

20:23.797 --> 20:24.861
Thank you.

20:25.180 --> 20:26.967
And you sorted out the
overheating problem?

20:27.137 --> 20:30.170
I'm completely sure that
I've absolutely sorted out

20:30.361 --> 20:32.021
the overheating problem, yes.

20:32.616 --> 20:34.371
Unless I've made it even worse.

20:35.498 --> 20:37.052
How do you feel? Do you feel ready?

20:37.264 --> 20:40.540
My middle name is ready.
No, that doesn't sound right.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.546
I eat ready for breakfast.

20:42.993 --> 20:46.900
OK, maybe don't talk too much.
Let the product do the talking.

20:47.411 --> 20:49.666
What do I do
when they want me to do the talking?

20:49.900 --> 20:52.015
- You're scaring him.
- Don't be scared, Moss.

20:52.270 --> 20:54.334
This is one of the biggest
moments of your life.

20:54.526 --> 20:57.287
You cannot get
nervous now because if you do, Moss,

20:57.415 --> 20:59.053
it'll be a disaster, a disaster!

20:59.711 --> 21:00.860
Shut up!

21:01.031 --> 21:03.520
I don't want to do it.
I feel trapped, like a moth in a bath.

21:06.742 --> 21:08.955
Moss, we're already late.

21:11.934 --> 21:13.864
Will you come on with me?

21:15.098 --> 21:16.836
- What?
- Please.

21:18.134 --> 21:20.304
Oh, actually,
maybe it's just the thing.

21:20.559 --> 21:24.490
If Helen Bewley sees it, she'll realise
I'm a proper professional,

21:24.843 --> 21:27.361
and not a member
of the sex industry. You sure?

21:28.212 --> 21:29.999
I'm positive.
You can do presentation.

21:30.829 --> 21:32.260
And I'll do fitness.

21:33.686 --> 21:38.674
'Jen, Roy and Morris are IT
professionals with Renham Industries.

21:39.163 --> 21:40.473
'They walk up the stairs

21:40.792 --> 21:42.005
and across the room.

21:42.966 --> 21:44.519
'They nod at the dragons.

21:45.243 --> 21:48.016
'One of them, Morris,
puts a case on a chair.

21:49.352 --> 21:52.717
'The dragons are beside
piles of money, with pens.'

21:55.355 --> 21:57.579
Women in the workplace...

22:00.196 --> 22:01.293
Take your time.

22:04.634 --> 22:09.498
Women working
in a workplace environment...

22:10.285 --> 22:14.497
work in workplaces...

22:18.127 --> 22:19.212
where they work...

22:19.779 --> 22:21.852
and as a woman,

22:23.325 --> 22:24.687
and as a woman, as a worker,

22:25.203 --> 22:26.799
as a woman worker who...

22:27.841 --> 22:29.203
works in the workplace...

22:33.309 --> 22:34.756
Sorry, bit of asthma.

23:09.724 --> 23:14.384
We are looking for £400,000 for 2%.
We'd welcome your questions.

23:26.359 --> 23:30.173
Wow, this music sounds like
it comes from space.

23:30.646 --> 23:32.299
- Yeah, mate.
- It does.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.278
Ordinary boys they ain't.

23:38.641 --> 23:40.854
I'm having a good time. Yeah.

23:42.237 --> 23:44.152
This is good, good shit.
