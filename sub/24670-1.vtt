00:49.466 --> 00:50.935
Can I get you
anything else today?

00:52.768 --> 00:55.336
That's a nice necklace.

00:55.338 --> 00:56.974
Thanks.
It was my grandmother's.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.374
My mom gave it to me.

01:00.376 --> 01:02.743
Beautiful ring, too.

01:02.745 --> 01:03.948
Thanks.

01:05.681 --> 01:07.649
It seems valuable.

01:07.651 --> 01:09.553
I don't know about that.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.554
But it is to me though.

01:13.556 --> 01:17.561
I've worn it every day
since she passed it on to me.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.529
When are you due?

01:21.531 --> 01:23.434
In January.

01:24.567 --> 01:26.401
Do you know
if it's a boy or girl?

01:26.403 --> 01:27.702
No.

01:27.704 --> 01:29.506
It's a surprise.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.309
A mystery.

01:35.511 --> 01:36.713
Yeah.

01:39.848 --> 01:41.416
Well...

01:41.418 --> 01:43.351
I can get you change.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.018
It's all yours.

01:45.020 --> 01:47.021
Thank you.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.423
God bless.

01:48.425 --> 01:49.923
You, too.

01:49.925 --> 01:50.893
Thanks.

04:10.033 --> 04:12.032
- Yes?
- Hi.

04:12.034 --> 04:14.604
I'm Daniel Coleman,
from Assembly Mutual.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.492
What are you looking at?

04:55.844 --> 04:58.813
If there is anything
you want specifically noted

04:58.815 --> 05:02.519
as being in need of proper
appraisal, just let me know.

05:04.854 --> 05:07.188
I thought that's
what you were here to do.

05:07.190 --> 05:09.657
I'm here to make sure
the value of your home

05:09.659 --> 05:13.027
is more or less what your
granddaughter Bethany assumes.

05:13.029 --> 05:16.963
Anything like furniture or art.
You know, little odd pieces...

05:16.965 --> 05:18.799
- Rare books would have to be...
- Rare books?

05:18.801 --> 05:19.967
Yeah.

05:19.969 --> 05:22.869
Come on.
Have a look around.

05:22.871 --> 05:25.708
You think I got anything
like that laying around?

05:27.042 --> 05:29.309
I don't know.
You probably don't know either.

05:29.311 --> 05:33.179
We'd have to get somebody
who deals more with appraisals

05:33.181 --> 05:35.715
to come in and let me know
what the value is.

05:35.717 --> 05:37.684
Well, the place itself,

05:37.686 --> 05:40.253
it's gotta be worth
more money.

05:40.255 --> 05:42.789
Now, certainly.
But it doesn't matter.

05:42.791 --> 05:44.991
You know why?

05:44.993 --> 05:47.861
Because they'll just tear
it down and build it again.

05:47.863 --> 05:50.698
I just went through that.
On both sides of me.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.633
You still live here, though.

05:52.635 --> 05:54.869
Well, what am I
supposed to do, move?

05:54.871 --> 05:56.671
Because they closed
my spots?

05:56.673 --> 05:58.575
Sure.
People have moved for less.

06:00.008 --> 06:01.979
I raised my family here.

06:03.111 --> 06:05.715
My wife, my two kids.

06:06.683 --> 06:08.585
My wife died here.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.989
It was not easy.
And you know what?

06:14.022 --> 06:17.794
It's home,
and I still like it.

06:22.065 --> 06:23.534
What are you writing?

06:25.034 --> 06:27.268
Just that,
as best as I can tell,

06:27.270 --> 06:29.837
nothing conflicts with what
Bethany claimed was here.

06:29.839 --> 06:31.672
I told her,
"Get a Dumpster."

06:31.674 --> 06:33.808
There are things
she might want to keep.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.010
For sentimental reasons.

06:36.012 --> 06:38.912
Well, then she
should be here.

06:38.914 --> 06:41.248
She was going to be. Last-minute thing.
I couldn't reschedule...

06:41.250 --> 06:45.018
Of course. Last-minute thing.
She had to change her schedule.

06:45.020 --> 06:48.289
How come nobody thought to ask
me if I'd change my schedule?

06:48.291 --> 06:51.258
You know, there's no need. In fact,
you don't even need to be here.

06:51.260 --> 06:53.326
A lot of the times I'm not
even brought in until after.

06:53.328 --> 06:54.897
After?

06:55.832 --> 06:57.734
After I'm dead?

07:01.837 --> 07:03.638
That, uh...

07:03.640 --> 07:06.373
You could put that one down.
I haven't read that yet.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.743
I thought everything
was trash.

07:08.745 --> 07:11.315
Well, it is, or will be.

07:23.258 --> 07:26.126
Do you mind
if I take a picture of you?

07:26.128 --> 07:27.962
Why?

07:27.964 --> 07:30.300
- I don't know.
- Be my guest.

07:31.967 --> 07:33.900
I'm not a relic.

07:33.902 --> 07:35.871
Wow.

07:39.308 --> 07:41.945
- What, I break your camera?
- No.

07:42.779 --> 07:44.214
It's a great shot.

07:45.113 --> 07:46.149
Thank you.

07:47.784 --> 07:49.719
Why are you still
looking around?

07:51.453 --> 07:53.220
Isn't all the stuff
adding up?

07:53.222 --> 07:56.123
It all adds up, Mr. Ashmore.

07:56.125 --> 08:00.193
Everything
is mathematically consistent

08:00.195 --> 08:04.097
with a widower in his 80s
who collects pension regularly.

08:04.099 --> 08:07.100
And what if it all turns out
to be nothing?

08:07.102 --> 08:08.436
You still get paid?

08:08.438 --> 08:10.270
I still get paid.

08:10.272 --> 08:12.138
The next guy, the appraiser,

08:12.140 --> 08:15.109
he only gets a percentage
of whatever this stuff is worth.

08:15.111 --> 08:18.212
But he only comes if I
determine it'll be worthwhile.

08:18.214 --> 08:19.847
And is it?

08:19.849 --> 08:23.017
There are a few pieces
that should be looked at.

08:23.019 --> 08:24.818
Well.

08:24.820 --> 08:27.724
Then it ain't
all trash, is it?

08:28.924 --> 08:31.127
Thank you for having me,
Mr. Ashmore.

08:32.727 --> 08:36.129
Hey, you got
a handshake, bud.

08:36.131 --> 08:38.431
No one
shakes hands anymore.

08:38.433 --> 08:40.400
Might you
be coming back?

08:40.403 --> 08:42.272
No, I don't think so.

08:47.175 --> 08:48.911
You can take that.
You can have it.

08:50.413 --> 08:52.812
I think
I read this one already.

08:52.814 --> 08:54.284
Have a good day.

09:21.977 --> 09:24.448
I knew he wasn't gonna be able
to deal with this on his own.

09:26.314 --> 09:28.014
I knew it.

09:28.016 --> 09:31.284
I knew he wasn't gonna be able
to go through all of his stuff.

09:31.286 --> 09:35.791
I mean, no one's gonna fly
in there and do it for him.

09:37.459 --> 09:39.192
"Thanks, Bethany."

09:39.194 --> 09:41.394
You gotta understand
where he's coming from, though.

09:41.396 --> 09:43.931
I don't want us to end up
with every single little thing...

09:43.933 --> 09:46.867
I wasn't talking
about every single piece.

09:46.869 --> 09:49.869
I was talking
about one thing, okay?

09:49.871 --> 09:53.941
Just... Just one thing
that he could maybe say,

09:53.943 --> 09:56.176
"Hey, this means a lot to me, and
I'd like for you to have it."

09:56.178 --> 09:58.878
Just one thing. It doesn't
even have to be of value.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.281
There could
still be something.

10:00.283 --> 10:02.416
I'm recommending a walk-through
with an appraiser.

10:02.418 --> 10:05.119
I probably can't be there, but you
guys should be there for that.

10:05.121 --> 10:07.421
Nothing major, but...

10:07.423 --> 10:09.455
You know, with folks
like your grandfather,

10:09.457 --> 10:12.125
there's always a chance that
underneath ten years of magazines,

10:12.127 --> 10:14.396
there's a table
worth $10,000.

10:21.504 --> 10:24.274
I don't like to think
about my grandfather dying.

10:27.909 --> 10:29.609
I really, really don't.

10:29.611 --> 10:32.549
And you being here can only
reinforce the notion that...

10:35.183 --> 10:37.319
sometime soon
that's gonna happen.

10:57.539 --> 10:58.638
Have a seat.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.075
Thanks.

11:03.379 --> 11:06.817
So let's say he does decide there's
something he wants to bestow.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.554
While that's all warm and fuzzy,
I have to ask the question:

11:13.289 --> 11:15.192
Is anything worth anything?

11:16.259 --> 11:17.427
What, um...

11:18.995 --> 11:21.030
What do you want
from your grandfather?

11:27.470 --> 11:29.372
I don't think
there's anything left.

11:31.439 --> 11:34.343
I mean, I got all of it.
Or Dad did.

11:36.544 --> 11:38.244
And I couldn't really say

11:38.246 --> 11:41.148
when the whole "if you want it,
take it" attitude started.

11:41.150 --> 11:44.417
But, boy, I'll tell you.

11:44.419 --> 11:48.955
His whole "you can't even
wait until I'm dead" period started

11:48.957 --> 11:51.060
right around
the time Grandma died.

11:57.198 --> 11:59.068
He's not a very generous man.

12:01.636 --> 12:03.106
Honestly...

12:04.340 --> 12:06.243
I think he's probably right.

12:08.110 --> 12:10.176
It's all just trash, you know.

12:10.178 --> 12:12.546
It's all just become part
of the decor of the place.

12:12.548 --> 12:14.517
That's why it's so easy
for him to be...

12:15.418 --> 12:17.618
surrounded by it.

12:17.620 --> 12:22.690
I don't think any specific thing
has a particular meaning,

12:22.692 --> 12:24.394
an individual meaning.

12:31.467 --> 12:33.734
But it doesn't mean
it's not related.

12:33.736 --> 12:36.003
You know? Just...

12:36.005 --> 12:38.107
It's some, um...

12:39.040 --> 12:40.376
some middle.

12:41.077 --> 12:42.279
You know?

12:44.246 --> 12:46.613
Maybe that's, um,

12:46.615 --> 12:50.520
one of the advantages
of living a long life...

12:52.621 --> 12:57.391
is you outgrow the tendency
to assign emotional meaning

12:57.393 --> 12:59.029
to a piece of paper.

13:05.201 --> 13:08.271
Well, we should
all be so lucky.

13:11.039 --> 13:12.541
You don't have
to outgrow.

13:15.644 --> 13:17.710
Me, I'm hardly the person
to tell people

13:17.712 --> 13:21.181
that it's wise to accumulate
more things in their homes,

13:21.183 --> 13:26.420
but you should remain open to the
possibility that something...

13:26.422 --> 13:28.122
it could be anything...

13:28.124 --> 13:31.226
of your grandfather's has
remained unseen by him for years.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.563
And you...

13:34.429 --> 13:35.731
maybe forever.

13:39.501 --> 13:41.303
Undiscovered.

13:43.172 --> 13:45.041
A box of love letters.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.310
Diaries.

13:48.276 --> 13:49.979
Photographs.

13:52.515 --> 13:54.317
Lives lived.

13:59.587 --> 14:03.389
So it all falls on me
because I live the closest?

14:03.391 --> 14:05.462
That seems to be
the way it works.

14:09.731 --> 14:12.235
He's lucky
to have you nearby.

14:17.073 --> 14:18.741
- I'll walk you out.
- Yeah.

14:24.813 --> 14:27.147
- Hey. Pleasure.
- Oh.

14:27.149 --> 14:29.351
- Thank you. Have a good day.
- Thanks.

14:33.521 --> 14:35.624
- Everything will be okay.
- Thanks.

16:40.415 --> 16:42.983
Oh! Are you
the insurance man?

16:42.985 --> 16:45.418
Daniel Coleman.
You must be Helen Greare.

16:45.420 --> 16:46.820
Yes.

16:46.822 --> 16:49.690
I'd invite you in,
but there is no "in."

16:52.794 --> 16:55.428
- So?
- So sorry.

16:55.430 --> 16:59.368
Yeah. This is my home.

17:02.638 --> 17:04.374
This is my kitchen.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.449
This is the living room.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.954
This is
the powder room here.

17:22.957 --> 17:24.393
So, uh, what happened?

17:27.463 --> 17:28.397
You know...

17:29.531 --> 17:32.302
I used to be
very sloppy about...

17:33.569 --> 17:36.969
changing the batteries
on the fire alarms.

17:36.971 --> 17:39.805
Ned was always the one
that did it.

17:39.807 --> 17:42.275
I would wait until I heard
the beeping and then say,

17:42.277 --> 17:45.579
"Oh, the batteries
ought to be changed."

17:45.581 --> 17:49.448
But he did it
before they started beeping.

17:49.450 --> 17:53.986
Every 90 days,
like it says on the package.

17:53.988 --> 17:57.427
But I'm better now.
I've had to learn how to do it.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.961
So, the fire department
still doesn't know

18:00.963 --> 18:03.629
if it was just, like,
a spark that went wrong

18:03.631 --> 18:06.632
or, you know,

18:06.634 --> 18:11.571
roll of paper towel left
too close to the pilot light,

18:11.573 --> 18:14.675
or what.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.642
You probably know
all this already.

18:16.644 --> 18:18.678
Well, the details,
they're helpful.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.546
Okay.

18:20.548 --> 18:23.750
Do you know why the fire
department was so delayed?

18:23.752 --> 18:26.586
Something about
an electrical malfunction.

18:26.588 --> 18:30.090
Oh. They were called,
like, 20 minutes

18:30.092 --> 18:33.859
before the O'Bryans
came home, 11:00 p.m.

18:33.861 --> 18:36.032
Response time is supposed to be...
Oh, I don't know.

18:37.599 --> 18:39.002
I understand.

18:42.571 --> 18:46.042
When the wind took
the fire to the O'Bryans...

18:47.543 --> 18:49.978
that was when I had this moment.

18:52.014 --> 18:54.917
You know, just an awful feeling.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.023
I knew...

19:02.990 --> 19:06.659
I need to go inside
and do that thing

19:06.661 --> 19:09.765
that people wonder about
their whole life.

19:11.467 --> 19:14.637
Decide what you take
from a burning building.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.678
I mean, it's easier when it's
just a hypothetical question...

19:23.812 --> 19:26.646
instead of when you see the...

19:26.648 --> 19:28.517
the tree...

19:30.119 --> 19:34.920
that touches both your home
and the one next door

19:34.922 --> 19:36.659
is on fire.

19:39.695 --> 19:41.794
It's just chaos at that point.

19:41.796 --> 19:43.932
People in their yards,
screaming.

19:45.601 --> 19:49.436
The police were here,
but a lot of good that did.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.608
They were the ones
that came in after me.

19:54.509 --> 19:58.080
I got, like, one minute
in my house...

19:59.448 --> 20:01.580
before they came
and took me out.

20:04.585 --> 20:06.688
Felt like ten seconds.

20:16.598 --> 20:21.571
Well, the rings and broaches
belonged to my great-grandmother.

20:23.104 --> 20:26.138
Standing out here, they were
the first things I pictured.

20:26.140 --> 20:31.447
I made for them like it
wasn't even a conscious decision.

20:32.848 --> 20:35.615
So now I'm upstairs,

20:35.617 --> 20:38.851
and already I can hear
the police calling my name.

20:38.853 --> 20:41.591
They're inside, downstairs.

20:43.057 --> 20:46.126
So, wouldn't
it have been smart

20:46.128 --> 20:48.628
for me to take
this whole chest?

20:48.630 --> 20:51.601
Oh, God. I don't know.
I can't tell you why.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.602
I knew that if I was gonna take
anything else, it had to be now.

20:56.604 --> 20:59.505
From this room,
our bedroom.

20:59.507 --> 21:03.209
And that's when I...

21:03.211 --> 21:05.147
saw this on the mantel.

21:07.716 --> 21:10.486
It was Ned's baseball.

21:11.887 --> 21:14.553
He wasn't a player
or anything.

21:14.555 --> 21:16.892
It just was
family history.

21:18.025 --> 21:19.993
The ball.

21:19.995 --> 21:23.996
His father gave it to him.
It's from the '40s.

21:23.998 --> 21:25.898
You know?

21:25.900 --> 21:29.836
If you asked me now who won what
game with it, I couldn't tell you.

21:29.838 --> 21:33.776
It was just "the ball."

21:35.043 --> 21:38.915
He always spoke about it
with such pride.

21:39.948 --> 21:41.516
Such value.

21:43.217 --> 21:44.187
Um...

21:48.689 --> 21:51.992
It was instinct.
It fit in my pocket.

21:51.994 --> 21:54.664
That's when they came in
and took me.

22:00.067 --> 22:03.705
When Ned died...

22:04.939 --> 22:09.809
um, the first thing
that Henry, my son,

22:09.811 --> 22:11.977
said was,
"What about the ball?"

22:11.979 --> 22:15.581
I mean, when we sat down
to go over the estate, you know.

22:15.583 --> 22:18.017
He said, "What about
the ball?"

22:18.019 --> 22:19.721
He wanted it.

22:21.122 --> 22:24.991
It was his birthright,
as far as he was concerned.

22:24.993 --> 22:26.926
I said,
"Well, he could have it,"

22:26.928 --> 22:30.597
but I just needed to keep
on looking at it for a while.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.735
I wasn't ready
to not see it there.

22:34.636 --> 22:38.040
It's been in some prominent place
in every home we've ever had.

22:39.908 --> 22:44.910
I told Henry when I moved,
it would be his.

22:44.912 --> 22:49.518
'Cause I knew that this house,
eventually, would be too much for me.

22:51.786 --> 22:55.024
I just didn't know that there
wasn't gonna be an "eventually."

23:00.595 --> 23:02.896
It could be worth more
than the house.

23:02.898 --> 23:04.598
For claim purposes.

23:04.600 --> 23:08.801
If it is insured and you
would have left it behind,

23:08.803 --> 23:12.237
I'd be writing you a check next
week for the amount of, uh...

23:12.239 --> 23:14.174
Well, it'd be substantial.

23:14.176 --> 23:15.311
Ah.

23:18.246 --> 23:22.752
Things that mattered more to
me, to the children, are gone.

23:24.620 --> 23:28.088
But I have Ned's ball.

23:28.090 --> 23:31.894
I don't understand it
or know what to do with it.

23:32.861 --> 23:34.296
I have it.

23:37.765 --> 23:39.799
- Helen?
- Oh, hi.

23:39.801 --> 23:43.637
This is Mrs. Singer. Jane Singer.
This is the insurance man.

23:43.639 --> 23:47.640
Oh, very nice to meet you. Would you both
like to come and have a cup of coffee?

23:47.642 --> 23:50.644
We've been kind of playing
welcome center these days.

23:50.646 --> 23:53.312
- Oh, that'll be nice. Okay.
- Good? Oh, good.

23:53.314 --> 23:56.081
- Thanks.
- Oh, our pleasure. I'll just leave the door open.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.019
Okay.
Thank you, Jane.

24:04.325 --> 24:08.029
The insurance covers the
home, the car, the valuables.

24:09.063 --> 24:14.167
It's the stuff
that's left out.

24:14.169 --> 24:19.304
We've lived here, um,
just over four years.

24:19.306 --> 24:25.078
So our restructuring and cleansing
and pawning off to the kids

24:25.080 --> 24:27.213
was done then.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.250
We didn't get the worst of it.

24:30.252 --> 24:33.990
Helen, I... I can't imagine
how it is for you.

24:38.325 --> 24:41.261
Thirty years.

24:41.263 --> 24:43.929
We moved here
when Lisa was three

24:43.931 --> 24:46.134
and Henry was seven.

24:50.839 --> 24:52.805
Did anything make it out?

24:52.807 --> 24:55.041
Well, we were very lucky

24:55.043 --> 24:58.712
because Riley had
a safe in his office.

24:58.714 --> 25:01.851
And not a small one either.
It was about this big.

25:03.884 --> 25:08.021
And our valuables and irreplaceable
heirlooms, and, um...

25:08.023 --> 25:10.122
My family's...

25:10.124 --> 25:13.827
My family's immigration papers.
Things over a hundred years old.

25:13.829 --> 25:16.161
We put them all in there.
Thank God.

25:16.163 --> 25:18.330
It was
a Father's Day gift.

25:18.332 --> 25:21.269
Kind of frivolous,
but I-I wanted it.

25:23.170 --> 25:26.741
I always dreamt of having
a nice study with a safe.

25:28.176 --> 25:31.043
Well, when I got the study,
they bought me the safe.

25:31.045 --> 25:33.279
It was mostly
entertaining.

25:33.281 --> 25:38.051
I love pushing
the buttons and...

25:38.053 --> 25:40.790
resetting the code
out of boredom.

25:42.224 --> 25:45.958
Never dreamed it
would come in handy.

25:45.960 --> 25:50.062
I'm usually listening to people lament
that they never bothered to lock it.

25:50.064 --> 25:53.099
What you're describing
is actually quite uncommon.

25:53.101 --> 25:57.870
Not that there was anything
of extreme monetary value,

25:57.872 --> 26:00.976
aside from my rings
and silver.

26:02.977 --> 26:06.314
But you know how it is.
It's the personal things.

26:07.282 --> 26:08.514
Personal things.

26:08.516 --> 26:10.917
I'm really glad
we put 'em in there.

26:10.919 --> 26:15.455
It's fine. We used to
hide little surprises in there.

26:15.457 --> 26:17.991
As a... As a joke.

26:17.993 --> 26:23.263
So if anybody needs a bobblehead
from the 1995 All-Star Game,

26:23.265 --> 26:26.499
Anna put two in there to get back
at me the day before the blaze.

26:29.537 --> 26:31.937
I shouldn't laugh.

26:31.939 --> 26:33.808
Well...

26:35.476 --> 26:38.077
- We should hit the road.
- No. Don't be silly.

26:38.079 --> 26:40.282
Please, stay,
as long as you want.

26:42.249 --> 26:45.019
We're staying about 50 miles
away, with our daughter.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.521
You're...
You're welcome to stay.

26:48.523 --> 26:52.992
I've got a drive to look forward to.
Thank you.

26:52.994 --> 26:55.765
- Daniel, can I ask you something?
- Please.

26:57.966 --> 27:02.505
What does it do to a person
to take all of this in?

27:03.839 --> 27:05.508
All due respect to Helen...

27:07.309 --> 27:10.042
this is pretty common,
right?

27:10.044 --> 27:13.413
You're clearly not hearing anything
that you haven't heard before.

27:13.415 --> 27:16.014
You're just sitting there. You're
barely reacting to anything of this...

27:16.016 --> 27:18.150
- Jim, Please. That's rude.
- No.

27:18.152 --> 27:20.219
It's okay. I understand.

27:20.221 --> 27:21.420
You're right.

27:21.422 --> 27:24.456
It's best to not become
terribly invested.

27:24.458 --> 27:27.126
I'm not a doctor or anything.

27:27.128 --> 27:31.630
My proximity to tragedy
is a smidge further away

27:31.632 --> 27:35.270
than somebody who truly
has to develop a barrier.

27:36.237 --> 27:38.807
But to be honest...

27:40.074 --> 27:42.311
it never
hurts me personally.

27:44.278 --> 27:46.414
And it never gets old.

27:48.650 --> 27:52.153
Every story has details
I've never heard before.

27:53.487 --> 27:57.092
Every person I talk to,
I learn something new.

28:00.394 --> 28:03.097
Not many people get to say that
about their jobs.

28:08.637 --> 28:11.040
You will never replace
your things.

28:13.675 --> 28:15.311
Or lives.

28:20.247 --> 28:21.283
But...

28:22.117 --> 28:25.321
I find something...

28:27.288 --> 28:29.121
magnetic...

28:29.123 --> 28:31.957
talking to people like yourself,

28:31.959 --> 28:36.465
who could have easily have been
trapped inside a burning house...

28:37.532 --> 28:38.634
and know it.

28:41.101 --> 28:44.169
Or people who feel some relief

28:44.171 --> 28:48.611
that the belongings they've accumulated
have avoided similar fates.

28:51.111 --> 28:52.413
And here's the thing.

28:55.950 --> 28:58.621
Nobody wants
to be talking to me.

29:00.255 --> 29:02.224
And I think
knowing that...

29:04.191 --> 29:06.428
makes my job a lot easier.

30:53.200 --> 30:54.736
Lives lived.

31:58.332 --> 32:00.166
Hey, Mom. We're getting
ready to hit the hay.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.801
You need anything else
for tonight?

32:01.803 --> 32:03.272
No, thanks.

32:04.471 --> 32:05.840
Everything okay?

32:07.374 --> 32:09.678
What do you think?

32:12.546 --> 32:14.679
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night.

32:14.681 --> 32:15.784
Good night.

33:26.787 --> 33:29.254
You'll never
be able to get me!

33:33.594 --> 33:36.561
Hey, boys, settle down.
Shh, shh, shh.

33:41.401 --> 33:43.602
- There you are.
- Hi.

33:43.604 --> 33:46.371
I wanted to ask you. Um...

33:46.373 --> 33:49.908
That photograph in the
guest room of Christmas,

33:49.910 --> 33:51.977
is that 2008?

33:51.979 --> 33:54.480
Uh, actually,
I think it was 2010.

33:54.482 --> 33:56.919
Oh. Yeah.

33:58.785 --> 34:01.753
I was looking at it
this morning when I woke up.

34:01.755 --> 34:04.523
Holidays have
been nice here, though.

34:04.525 --> 34:06.958
Oh, yeah. But...

34:06.960 --> 34:10.996
Well, I love coming here
to see the boys.

34:10.998 --> 34:14.966
But, you know,
Ned never had Christmas here.

34:14.967 --> 34:21.774
His... I mean, you bought the
house after he was here.

34:21.775 --> 34:24.876
It's been long enough
that I...

34:24.878 --> 34:28.847
I just assumed
I was through giving things up.

34:28.849 --> 34:30.952
Now this morning I realized...

34:32.052 --> 34:33.918
more to give up.

34:33.920 --> 34:38.724
It's the second Saturday. You know,
we had second Saturday cards.

34:38.726 --> 34:44.295
So I guess there'll be no more
cards with friends at my house.

34:44.297 --> 34:46.465
Hmm. But cards are light.

34:46.467 --> 34:48.565
You can
take 'em anywhere.

34:48.568 --> 34:49.704
Yeah.

34:50.704 --> 34:53.338
But it's...

34:53.340 --> 34:54.842
not about the cards.

34:55.809 --> 34:57.878
Okay. Thank you.

35:09.923 --> 35:11.726
I didn't mean it like that.

35:12.994 --> 35:14.760
You could've fooled me.

35:14.762 --> 35:17.430
I'm not
being insensitive.

35:17.432 --> 35:20.802
You're just reacting because
you're afraid it's inevitable.

35:21.903 --> 35:23.702
Assisted living?

35:23.704 --> 35:27.673
It is completely
independent cottages.

35:27.675 --> 35:30.675
But in a facility
with employees, staff.

35:30.677 --> 35:33.646
Only if you need anything
or want something.

35:33.648 --> 35:36.981
Even just a ride somewhere. Sometimes
maybe you don't want to drive yourself.

35:36.983 --> 35:41.454
I like driving myself.
I'm fine driving myself.

35:41.456 --> 35:43.988
You have to have thought about
where you're gonna live.

35:43.990 --> 35:46.124
- The insurance money is...
- Yeah, you're right.

35:46.126 --> 35:48.561
It's a lot.
It's quite a bit.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.829
But you're cash poor.

35:50.831 --> 35:53.966
I am accustomed
to having my own house.

35:53.968 --> 35:56.535
Well, your house
burned down,

35:56.537 --> 35:58.570
and you can't
live there anymore!

35:58.572 --> 36:02.041
I don't mean to yell.
But come on.

36:02.043 --> 36:04.477
Mom, things are not the same
as they were before.

36:04.479 --> 36:08.012
Things have changed.
You need a plan. We need...

36:08.014 --> 36:10.149
Well, you know,
I can sell some things.

36:10.151 --> 36:12.921
Stop. Don't sell anything.

36:16.990 --> 36:19.892
I mean,
the jewelry alone is...

36:19.894 --> 36:21.760
You don't want it.

36:21.762 --> 36:24.065
I mean, Lisa might, but...

36:25.432 --> 36:26.932
We can take care of you.

36:28.903 --> 36:31.570
You've just been saying
that you won't.

36:31.572 --> 36:34.943
That's not what I said. And you
know that's not what I said.

36:38.713 --> 36:40.782
Those belong to you.

36:41.749 --> 36:43.749
Lisa wants 'em.

36:43.751 --> 36:47.019
She's never admitted to you
how badly she wants 'em.

36:47.021 --> 36:48.856
Trust me.

36:54.961 --> 36:56.995
You're just like him.

36:56.997 --> 36:59.568
Always telling me what to do.

37:17.718 --> 37:19.488
I love you, Mom.

37:21.856 --> 37:25.727
Don't feel like you have a limit
on how long you can stay here.

37:30.164 --> 37:31.633
Thanks.

37:57.057 --> 37:59.191
<i>She just needs more time.</i>

37:59.193 --> 38:01.129
<i>She has to process it.</i>

38:02.762 --> 38:04.632
<i>I know, but how much?</i>

38:05.566 --> 38:07.666
<i>She has to understand by now</i>

38:07.668 --> 38:13.204
<i>that pretending things will somehow go back
to the way they were before is ludicrous.</i>

38:13.206 --> 38:14.840
<i>She's an old lady</i>

38:14.842 --> 38:19.144
<i>who spent decades
looking at these objects.</i>

38:19.146 --> 38:22.717
<i>She still thinks of herself as
living in or with these objects.</i>

38:26.521 --> 38:29.021
I just wish she could have
gotten more of Dad's things.

38:29.023 --> 38:32.461
Then maybe she wouldn't feel
so untethered.

38:33.961 --> 38:37.095
You know, she told me
that the logs in the fireplace

38:37.097 --> 38:39.298
still had kindling
under them and everything

38:39.300 --> 38:41.901
- from the last fire that your dad built.
- Mm-hmm.

38:41.903 --> 38:45.037
She thinks that because
they'd been there for ten years,

38:45.039 --> 38:47.640
it somehow made the fire worse,
like a bomb.

38:47.642 --> 38:50.742
She loved that fireplace.

38:50.744 --> 38:52.611
She loved everything.

38:52.613 --> 38:55.314
Once he was gone,
she'd never let it be used.

38:55.316 --> 38:57.048
Dad's fire.

38:57.050 --> 38:58.953
The last fire he built.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.089
Such a bummer.

39:05.892 --> 39:07.195
<i>I know her.</i>

39:08.996 --> 39:11.129
<i>I know she can't have
half the jewelry</i>

39:11.131 --> 39:13.832
<i>without thinking
of the other half.</i>

39:13.834 --> 39:18.236
<i>She can't have the car without
thinking of everything in the garage.</i>

39:18.238 --> 39:20.939
- <i>She won't get rid of it.</i>
- <i>She's insinuating.</i>

39:20.941 --> 39:24.776
I know she'd never
go through with it.

39:24.778 --> 39:29.347
She's too attached
to everything it represents.

39:29.349 --> 39:31.816
It's just like his ball.

39:31.818 --> 39:35.854
<i>It's some thing
that makes no sense to her</i>

39:35.856 --> 39:40.061
<i>but that she doesn't have the
ability to detach herself from.</i>

39:44.599 --> 39:46.030
<i>No.</i>

39:46.032 --> 39:47.932
I'll know for certain

39:47.934 --> 39:52.070
the day she seriously considers getting
rid of the jewelry or the ball

39:52.072 --> 39:53.974
is the day I eat my hat.

39:55.977 --> 39:57.876
<i>I almost wish she could.</i>

39:57.878 --> 40:01.914
<i>I'd like the ball, just as Lisa
would like everything else.</i>

40:04.352 --> 40:06.184
<i>But for Mom's sake,</i>

40:06.186 --> 40:08.989
<i>I almost wish she'd get rid
of the stuff.</i>

40:11.726 --> 40:15.126
She's gonna drag it around
with her, like an albatross?

40:15.128 --> 40:17.765
I'd be happier for her
to see it all gone.

40:19.166 --> 40:21.100
<i>Riley?</i>

40:21.102 --> 40:23.301
<i>Hi. It's Helen.</i>

40:23.303 --> 40:25.403
I-I hope
I didn't wake you up.

40:25.405 --> 40:27.207
I'm sorry to call so late.

40:28.275 --> 40:29.975
Oh, good.

40:29.977 --> 40:31.580
Listen, um...

40:32.813 --> 40:35.713
I wanted to ask you
about that gentleman

40:35.715 --> 40:37.850
that you mentioned
the other night,

40:37.852 --> 40:41.323
the re-saler
that your daughter found.

40:42.356 --> 40:44.659
Appraiser. I see. Yeah.

40:46.026 --> 40:47.294
Oh, sure.

40:52.967 --> 40:55.235
And you found him
really helpful?

40:59.173 --> 41:01.209
Las Vegas?

41:02.276 --> 41:03.345
Oh.

41:05.311 --> 41:06.780
Uh-huh.

41:08.715 --> 41:10.682
Well, no, I wouldn't...

41:10.684 --> 41:14.221
I wouldn't send anything really
valuable in the mail either.

41:16.691 --> 41:18.356
Well...

41:18.358 --> 41:20.191
I'm... I'm not sure.

41:20.193 --> 41:23.128
It's not definite yet.
I just...

41:23.130 --> 41:26.932
Well, you know,
I just thought that I...

41:26.934 --> 41:30.839
What could it hurt if I gave him a
call and see what he says, right?

41:32.907 --> 41:34.338
Okay.

41:34.340 --> 41:36.140
Yeah, thanks a lot, huh?

41:36.142 --> 41:39.179
And listen, tell Anna...
You know, send her my love.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.983
Okay. Thank you.

41:42.450 --> 41:44.015
Bye.

43:19.046 --> 43:21.381
<i>These are our remainders.</i>

43:25.218 --> 43:28.553
<i>Of our lives, of many forms.</i>

43:28.555 --> 43:30.224
<i>Emotional.</i>

43:31.191 --> 43:32.392
<i>Physical.</i>

43:35.296 --> 43:38.133
<i>These are our artifacts.</i>

43:40.534 --> 43:42.470
<i>Our scars.</i>

43:44.604 --> 43:46.273
<i>Objects.</i>

43:49.343 --> 43:50.979
<i>Memories.</i>

43:56.883 --> 43:59.219
<i>Items that are tangible.</i>

44:00.220 --> 44:01.789
<i>Memorable.</i>

44:03.523 --> 44:05.559
<i>We live our lives and ask...</i>

44:07.260 --> 44:09.530
<i>"What do we leave behind?"</i>

44:11.331 --> 44:14.298
<i>When we look at the pictures
long enough,</i>

44:14.300 --> 44:16.236
<i>they reappear.</i>

44:18.005 --> 44:20.874
<i>What is the value of anything?</i>

44:30.985 --> 44:34.255
<i>Can what we hold in our hands
be the same...</i>

44:35.389 --> 44:38.055
<i>as what we hold in our hearts?</i>

44:57.311 --> 45:01.082
<i>Um, hello, Mr. Bleam.
This is Helen Greare...</i>

45:03.082 --> 45:08.289
calling to confirm what time
it would be good for us to meet.

45:28.508 --> 45:29.644
Can I help you?

45:32.146 --> 45:34.345
I'm Helen Greare.

45:34.347 --> 45:37.515
Oh, yes. Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sorry. Of course.

45:37.517 --> 45:39.216
It's nice to meet you.

45:39.218 --> 45:40.519
- Hi. Welcome.
- Thank you.

45:40.521 --> 45:42.354
Will Bleam.
Come on in, please.

45:42.356 --> 45:45.157
Uh, have a seat.
Let's see what you've got here.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.425
- I know it's a lot.
- It's a lot.

45:47.427 --> 45:48.961
Right?

45:48.963 --> 45:52.030
Most of the stuff I get
is from people like you.

45:52.032 --> 45:54.599
But I also get, you know,
some conventions,

45:54.601 --> 46:00.472
and, uh, you know, trips I take
and other stores, what have you.

46:00.474 --> 46:02.740
And sometimes the families
of players reach out...

46:02.742 --> 46:06.345
- Please, please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

46:06.347 --> 46:08.546
But honestly, mostly my
reputation, at this point,

46:08.548 --> 46:11.385
gets most of the heavy
lifting done, so...

46:12.619 --> 46:14.521
Uh, let's take a look
at what you have.

46:16.256 --> 46:18.256
People my age
come to Las Vegas

46:18.258 --> 46:22.697
to gamble away their pensions
and their life savings.

46:24.030 --> 46:27.365
Mm-hmm.

46:27.367 --> 46:30.369
Well, you have come to unburden
yourself in a different way, huh?

46:34.541 --> 46:36.678
So, why don't you tell me...

46:37.778 --> 46:40.012
how you came across this.

46:40.014 --> 46:45.017
Um, my husband's father
got it,

46:45.019 --> 46:47.651
um, from his father.

46:47.653 --> 46:50.555
And I think it was given
to him at a game.

46:50.557 --> 46:53.225
And it's been
in the family ever since.

46:53.227 --> 46:58.062
Huh. Well, the good news is I can
almost guarantee you it's authentic.

46:58.064 --> 47:02.033
- Yeah.
- Um, you know, there's not a lot of things like this

47:02.035 --> 47:06.671
that are in families for generation after
generation that turn out to be fake.

47:06.673 --> 47:08.673
Yep. Why is that?

47:08.675 --> 47:11.108
Well, honestly,
something like this,

47:11.110 --> 47:13.544
it was just a more
honest time back then.

47:13.546 --> 47:15.814
There wasn't as much money
to be made from collectibles.

47:15.816 --> 47:17.783
That sort of thing.

47:17.785 --> 47:20.651
The only thing we generally have to be
careful for is a situation like this,

47:20.653 --> 47:22.620
where somebody passes away.

47:22.622 --> 47:26.158
They're going through their
valuables, and it's mostly artwork.

47:26.160 --> 47:29.160
You know, I just can't go
out 10,000, $20,000 out

47:29.162 --> 47:31.562
on something that might
be proven to be false.

47:31.564 --> 47:33.564
- Oh, no, there's no chance.
- Of course not.

47:33.566 --> 47:35.633
Not with this.
I understand.

47:35.635 --> 47:38.503
Uh, that said, if we're looking
at something like this,

47:38.505 --> 47:42.744
we are probably looking at
something like 80,000 to 100,000.

47:44.378 --> 47:46.278
Um...

47:46.280 --> 47:48.245
it's in excellent
condition,

47:48.247 --> 47:51.483
and, uh, Ted Williams
autographs are very scarce,

47:51.485 --> 47:54.419
especially on an
actual piece of equipment.

47:54.421 --> 47:56.390
- Do you know who Ted Williams is?
- No.

47:57.523 --> 48:01.626
Well, it's a terrific piece.

48:01.628 --> 48:04.729
And the people who specialize
in collecting this era,

48:04.731 --> 48:07.769
they know what price point
they're getting into.

48:09.802 --> 48:13.204
I guess everything here
has a story, huh?

48:13.206 --> 48:14.409
Yes.

48:15.508 --> 48:16.707
Yes. And, you know,

48:16.709 --> 48:19.778
I try to relate that
to the buyers.

48:19.780 --> 48:22.247
And some of them
are actually eager to learn.

48:22.249 --> 48:23.881
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

48:23.883 --> 48:29.287
But also sometimes my buyers
come in looking for a gift.

48:29.289 --> 48:32.657
You know? And so,
to that person,

48:32.659 --> 48:34.595
the object
just sort of appears...

48:36.497 --> 48:38.762
on their birthday
or their anniversary

48:38.764 --> 48:40.365
or their retirement.

48:40.367 --> 48:41.302
You get what I'm saying?

48:43.570 --> 48:46.204
- Well...
- Saying good-bye is hard.

48:46.206 --> 48:47.508
I know that.

48:49.510 --> 48:53.245
And you-you shouldn't, you know,
feel ridiculous about that either.

48:53.247 --> 48:57.615
- No.
- It's... It's-It's difficult.

48:57.617 --> 49:00.353
What was your husband's
name, if I may ask?

49:02.356 --> 49:03.424
Ned.

49:05.291 --> 49:07.427
Edward Roger Greare.

49:11.197 --> 49:12.930
I bet Ned liked
to talk about the ball.

49:12.932 --> 49:14.399
Oh!

49:14.401 --> 49:16.734
I bet he... I bet he liked
to talk about it a lot.

49:16.736 --> 49:18.702
Tell the same story
over and over again.

49:18.704 --> 49:19.803
- Yes.
- Right?

49:19.805 --> 49:21.907
And it's my understanding

49:21.909 --> 49:23.675
from the brief conversations
that we've had

49:23.677 --> 49:25.876
that you didn't retain
the legend of the ball.

49:25.878 --> 49:27.178
- Is that correct?
- No.

49:27.180 --> 49:29.213
No. Right.
And that's okay too.

49:29.215 --> 49:31.216
- It's not your ball.
- Mm-hmm.

49:31.218 --> 49:33.852
Ned loved the story
of the ball.

49:33.854 --> 49:38.423
And you selling it to me doesn't... doesn't
change that, doesn't take it away.

49:38.425 --> 49:39.360
You know?

49:41.227 --> 49:42.359
Yeah.

49:42.361 --> 49:44.863
Um, do you have
any children?

49:44.865 --> 49:46.530
Two.

49:46.532 --> 49:49.236
You know, would either
of them maybe want this?

49:50.803 --> 49:53.370
Perhaps. Maybe.

49:53.372 --> 49:57.742
Okay. Well, when you...
If you decide to...

49:57.744 --> 50:00.881
But when you
tell them, uh...

50:02.515 --> 50:03.847
Worst-case scenario,

50:03.849 --> 50:07.755
they may be upset
with you for a moment.

50:09.923 --> 50:12.356
But...

50:12.358 --> 50:16.727
best-case scenario,
I think they will understand

50:16.729 --> 50:20.267
and realize that you doing this
was the best for you.

50:21.767 --> 50:25.269
Because you have so many
other things to remember Ned

50:25.271 --> 50:26.671
other than this ball.

50:26.673 --> 50:28.508
Right?

50:32.412 --> 50:33.648
Right.

50:39.519 --> 50:41.686
Do you have children?

50:41.688 --> 50:42.956
No.

50:43.990 --> 50:45.659
Are you married?

50:47.727 --> 50:49.426
Not recently, no. No.

50:49.428 --> 50:51.863
Uh, she...

50:51.865 --> 50:53.832
she left me.

50:53.834 --> 50:55.469
Why?

50:57.271 --> 50:59.539
Well, uh...

51:01.340 --> 51:03.675
She came in one day and said
that she had had enough.

51:03.677 --> 51:04.812
She didn't love me anymore.

51:08.814 --> 51:12.383
It was right around the time
when I started with this place.

51:12.385 --> 51:13.688
And I was...

51:15.488 --> 51:17.824
pretty unavailable,
to say the least.

51:19.425 --> 51:21.561
But still a bit of a shock.

51:25.731 --> 51:28.666
Uh, about nine years ago.

51:28.668 --> 51:30.704
Still trying
to make sense of it.

51:38.778 --> 51:40.447
Well...

51:42.448 --> 51:44.316
it's just a thing.

51:46.385 --> 51:48.019
You've never
seen it before,

51:48.021 --> 51:51.555
and by tomorrow,
it'll be up on that shelf.

51:51.557 --> 51:56.093
And maybe by next week,
it'll be gone already.

51:56.095 --> 52:00.501
Or maybe it'll sit here
for a year or maybe two years.

52:03.503 --> 52:04.705
And...

52:07.807 --> 52:09.610
you won't remember me.

52:11.644 --> 52:14.611
When people come
and sit where I'm sitting

52:14.613 --> 52:16.448
and feel what I'm feeling...

52:20.019 --> 52:23.687
you'll just be able to tell them,
with a little more confidence,

52:23.689 --> 52:27.794
that what they're feeling
is common.

52:29.796 --> 52:31.032
Yeah.

52:32.365 --> 52:34.634
You won't remember Helen.

52:35.735 --> 52:36.903
Ned's wife.

52:39.439 --> 52:41.375
With Ned's ball.

52:44.010 --> 52:46.914
You'll just know
that these things happen.

52:48.414 --> 52:52.950
And widows and... and children

52:52.952 --> 52:54.986
have a hard time.

52:54.988 --> 52:57.421
And you give them money.

52:57.423 --> 52:58.659
And...

52:59.825 --> 53:02.063
the money does make it easier.

53:03.130 --> 53:04.532
A bit.

53:06.400 --> 53:08.336
And that's okay.

53:10.736 --> 53:12.539
Because, um...

53:18.644 --> 53:20.514
Ned's gone.

53:27.854 --> 53:30.424
And now so is his ball.

53:33.894 --> 53:35.129
Oh.

53:45.472 --> 53:47.742
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.

54:05.791 --> 54:07.727
Bleam Collectibles.
This is Will speaking.

54:09.061 --> 54:10.997
Hey, Chris,
how's it going?

54:14.568 --> 54:16.604
Yes, I did. I thought
you'd be interested.

54:17.938 --> 54:20.874
Yeah, it's very fresh.
It's still warm, in fact.

54:23.776 --> 54:26.544
I think it was
on her husband's side.

54:29.115 --> 54:31.886
Uh...

54:33.019 --> 54:33.954
Yeah.

54:35.155 --> 54:36.490
Yes.

54:37.858 --> 54:40.660
Well, she knew
it was worth something.

54:41.827 --> 54:43.596
Mm-hmm.

54:44.831 --> 54:46.064
Mm-hmm.

54:46.066 --> 54:47.966
I was very fair.

54:47.968 --> 54:50.167
Yes. Very fair for me.

54:50.169 --> 54:51.936
Uh...

54:51.938 --> 54:54.508
Listen, I got
another call. Can...

54:56.809 --> 54:58.709
What do you mean, no?

54:58.711 --> 55:00.046
I'm gonna take...

55:02.849 --> 55:05.182
Okay, that's $10,000 more
than I'm asking.

55:05.184 --> 55:07.053
And you know I'm asking
more than it's worth.

55:10.624 --> 55:11.992
Uh...

55:13.626 --> 55:15.693
Yes.

55:15.695 --> 55:18.798
I mean, you've seen the pictures.
It's absolutely perfect.

55:20.800 --> 55:23.166
No. No, no, no.
That won't work.

55:23.168 --> 55:26.105
I'm, uh... I'm flying out
tomorrow afternoon.

55:28.909 --> 55:31.642
I'm going home.
I'm going to my old home.

55:31.644 --> 55:34.814
I'm gonna help clean out my
parents' house with my sister.

55:36.282 --> 55:38.084
Yeah.

55:40.220 --> 55:42.320
Yeah, well, look,
nobody knows more than me

55:42.322 --> 55:46.090
that when it's time for it all to
go, you gotta get rid of it all.

55:46.092 --> 55:47.695
That's right.

55:50.095 --> 55:53.030
All right.
I'll talk to you Monday.

58:45.838 --> 58:47.273
<i>Have you talked
to them recently?</i>

58:48.775 --> 58:51.508
I did. I called to say
that I was coming here.

58:51.510 --> 58:55.012
They were less interested in that fact
than I thought maybe they would be.

58:55.014 --> 58:56.981
Come on. Take it easy.

58:56.983 --> 58:58.883
No. This is important to me.

58:58.885 --> 59:00.218
- I flew here.
- Just don't be...

59:00.220 --> 59:01.986
I flew here for this.
That's more than they did.

59:01.988 --> 59:05.388
You always fly here.
Just don't be negative.

59:05.390 --> 59:08.258
- I travel twice a month for work.
- I know that.

59:08.260 --> 59:10.428
So flying here twice a year
is not that big a deal.

59:10.430 --> 59:12.765
I have a very favorable
mileage situation.

59:14.834 --> 59:18.336
I just... I can't believe they didn't
take more of their stuff, you know.

59:18.338 --> 59:19.937
- That...
- Well, duh.

59:19.939 --> 59:22.405
It's not their stuff anymore.
You know what I mean?

59:22.407 --> 59:26.244
At this point. They took what they
wanted and they left the rest.

59:26.246 --> 59:30.814
That's the whole point of why old
folks move from a house to a condo.

59:30.816 --> 59:33.486
There's less space,
less stuff.

59:36.789 --> 59:39.990
You talk down to me so much.

59:39.992 --> 59:42.059
- I don't talk...
- You think I'm an idiot.

59:42.061 --> 59:44.394
- I'm not... I don't. I don't.
- Yeah, you do. Yeah.

59:44.396 --> 59:45.732
And I'm not talking
down to you.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.379
I wish you
would stay with us.

01:00:02.381 --> 01:00:04.182
I don't want
to inconvenience you.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:06.184
Besides, maybe staying here
a couple extra nights

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:08.952
might make me actually
feel something.

01:00:08.954 --> 01:00:10.923
Doesn't sound like you.

01:00:14.927 --> 01:00:16.262
Oh!

01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:19.932
- Whoa.
- Right?

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.302
Yeah, no joke.

01:00:23.336 --> 01:00:24.772
Uff-da.

01:00:29.575 --> 01:00:32.475
This is difficult.
I love this house.

01:00:32.477 --> 01:00:35.515
I love this place too,
but, you know...

01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:40.153
Got a lot of good memories here.
It's just a house.

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:44.258
- That we grew up in.
- Mm.

01:00:46.358 --> 01:00:48.526
Boy.

01:00:48.528 --> 01:00:50.928
I think Tallie's having
a really hard time with it.

01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:52.533
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:55.135
And every...

01:00:56.369 --> 01:00:58.001
Christmas
and Thanksgiving...

01:00:58.003 --> 01:01:01.606
Every memory she has
is in here.

01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:04.975
Yeah, well,
she'll get over it.

01:01:04.977 --> 01:01:06.313
I mean, she still
has the memories.

01:01:08.581 --> 01:01:10.249
Make new ones.

01:01:12.418 --> 01:01:16.120
I think it's harder
on her them moving away

01:01:16.122 --> 01:01:18.088
than...
than she even knows or...

01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:19.155
I don't know.

01:01:19.157 --> 01:01:20.591
She was really lucky

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:23.260
to have gotten to grow up so
close to her grandparents.

01:01:23.262 --> 01:01:25.264
There's gonna be
other holidays.

01:01:26.499 --> 01:01:28.001
Mm.

01:01:40.046 --> 01:01:42.012
God, it was easy
to sneak out.

01:01:46.184 --> 01:01:48.486
I don't want
to spend Christmas in Florida.

01:01:48.488 --> 01:01:52.455
Well, better get your serving trays
out, 'cause it's on you now.

01:02:01.267 --> 01:02:03.035
Oh, geez.

01:02:25.557 --> 01:02:31.062
But it's so weird to stay in a house
that's been empty for too long.

01:02:32.264 --> 01:02:34.064
Well, if I don't make it
through the night,

01:02:34.066 --> 01:02:36.269
you can tell everybody
that I died as I lived...

01:02:37.403 --> 01:02:39.238
in my childhood home.

01:02:41.006 --> 01:02:42.608
Uh... Yeah, well...

01:02:44.376 --> 01:02:47.577
You're a puzzle, little Bro.

01:02:47.579 --> 01:02:50.381
You're gonna meet me
at 10:00, right?

01:02:50.383 --> 01:02:55.218
Yes. You know, I should refuse
to do that out of principle.

01:02:55.220 --> 01:03:00.256
- Why? You have a principle against storage lockers?
- No. I love storage lockers.

01:03:00.258 --> 01:03:05.095
In fact, I've probably found hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of sales in them.

01:03:05.097 --> 01:03:08.631
- I just don't think you should be renting one.
- Oh, God.

01:03:08.633 --> 01:03:13.303
You know, just because you have nothing
in your life that you love or care about

01:03:13.305 --> 01:03:17.041
doesn't mean
that we all should be the same.

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:20.012
- I care about things. I care about things.
- Sure, so you say.

01:03:21.314 --> 01:03:23.717
- Okay. See you in the morn.
- Drive safely.

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:28.285
- Drive safely.
- I'll try.

01:03:28.287 --> 01:03:30.220
- All right. Later, gator.
- Bye.

01:03:30.222 --> 01:03:31.691
- Ooh!
- You got it.

01:06:03.809 --> 01:06:05.475
Oh, man.

01:06:05.477 --> 01:06:08.245
I bet that the cost of your
two-year lease on this thing

01:06:08.247 --> 01:06:10.914
is worth three times more than
anything you're putting in here.

01:06:10.916 --> 01:06:13.684
It's not about the money.

01:06:13.686 --> 01:06:15.718
But you have an attic.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.888
You have a basement. You have a house.
Can't you put this there?

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:22.626
Well, then I'd have to fucking see it
every single day, and I don't want to.

01:06:27.332 --> 01:06:31.669
Maybe I just don't want
to go downstairs every day

01:06:31.671 --> 01:06:33.736
and see all this stuff.

01:06:33.738 --> 01:06:36.606
Maybe it'll remind me of something
that's a little too hard,

01:06:36.608 --> 01:06:38.209
and I just...

01:06:38.211 --> 01:06:40.213
It would get to me. Do you understand?
No, you don't.

01:06:43.782 --> 01:06:47.785
Well, just saying, what is this,
25 percent of their stuff?

01:06:47.787 --> 01:06:49.919
They took 25 percent
of it with them.

01:06:49.921 --> 01:06:51.722
You take whatever
you're gonna take.

01:06:51.724 --> 01:06:54.992
So we just throw 50 percent
of it into a Dumpster?

01:06:54.994 --> 01:06:56.595
I guess so.

01:06:58.697 --> 01:07:00.866
Well, this is
exploitation of labor.

01:07:01.968 --> 01:07:04.401
People usually
get paid for this.

01:07:12.878 --> 01:07:15.678
I know why Carol left you.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.715
Wow. What a shitty thing
to say.

01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:21.654
You're such a shit, man.

01:07:22.655 --> 01:07:23.957
I love you.

01:07:26.258 --> 01:07:27.858
God, this is all junk.

01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:30.693
We don't need any of this,
all right?

01:07:30.695 --> 01:07:33.530
You wanted my professional opinion.
This is all junk.

01:07:33.532 --> 01:07:35.798
Look through this and see
if there's anything valuable.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.300
There's nothing valuable
up here.

01:07:37.302 --> 01:07:39.602
That's why it's been
in the attic our whole life.

01:07:39.604 --> 01:07:42.673
- These were their wedding present.
- Who cares?

01:07:42.675 --> 01:07:45.975
No, because...
From Grandma and Grandpa.

01:07:45.977 --> 01:07:48.379
And if it meant
anything to them,

01:07:48.381 --> 01:07:50.414
they would have taken it
down to Florida with them.

01:07:50.416 --> 01:07:51.948
Oh, come on.
These are nice.

01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:54.751
I'm gonna save them. Give them
to Tallie to take to college.

01:07:54.753 --> 01:07:57.588
What? You don't send
a kid off to college

01:07:57.590 --> 01:07:59.722
with bowls and plates
from the '50s.

01:07:59.724 --> 01:08:02.760
You buy her 60 bucks worth of plastic
shit that she'll throw away in two years.

01:08:02.762 --> 01:08:05.629
All right.
I know. But, I mean...

01:08:05.631 --> 01:08:07.798
Just shut up. What am I
supposed to do with it?

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:09.432
- Donate it. Get rid of it.
- No.

01:08:09.434 --> 01:08:11.669
Give it to Goodwill. Send it
to the church donation center.

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:14.305
That is the solution
to all of this stuff

01:08:14.307 --> 01:08:16.573
that isn't
direct family ephemera.

01:08:16.575 --> 01:08:18.309
Mom!

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:19.877
You're just... sad.

01:08:19.879 --> 01:08:22.412
- Uncle Will.
- Oh, my God, that's me!

01:08:22.415 --> 01:08:24.546
- Tallie! Hi.
- Hi.

01:08:24.549 --> 01:08:25.682
Mwah.

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:26.850
How'd you know?

01:08:26.852 --> 01:08:29.520
"Uncle Will arrives
this weekend."

01:08:29.522 --> 01:08:31.453
- About 1000 times.
- I get it. Right.

01:08:31.456 --> 01:08:34.957
- Hi, babe. How was school?
- I don't know. The same.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.861
"The same, Mom. It was the same.
School was the same."

01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:40.698
But, uh, how long
is this gonna take?

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:43.370
But you just got here.
You got somewhere else to go?

01:08:45.437 --> 01:08:46.970
Okay. Uh...

01:08:46.971 --> 01:08:50.474
- Wait a second. Did I show you these?
- Oh, God.

01:08:50.475 --> 01:08:54.011
Dad's rackets. Did I tell you that
she got a scholarship to Vanderbilt?

01:08:54.013 --> 01:08:56.912
Yes, you told me that. You've told me
1000 times. Of course you told me.

01:08:56.915 --> 01:08:58.046
Congratulations, Tallie.

01:08:58.049 --> 01:09:00.383
- That's very impressive.
- Thank you.

01:09:00.385 --> 01:09:02.819
Yeah, these are cool.
I'm gonna save these for you.

01:09:02.821 --> 01:09:04.921
I'm gonna play tennis
at Vanderbilt

01:09:04.924 --> 01:09:07.957
with some
antique wooden racquets.

01:09:09.594 --> 01:09:13.895
Uh, how about this record
about a blind guy?

01:09:13.898 --> 01:09:17.133
That's Grandpa's jazz. That's
his collection. Forget it.

01:09:17.135 --> 01:09:18.667
This actually
might be worth something.

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:20.069
I thought everything
was worthless to you.

01:09:20.071 --> 01:09:21.738
No, this is...
Some things are not.

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:23.974
These?
These are worth something?

01:09:23.975 --> 01:09:26.709
Yes, they might actually be worth something
because they're first pressings.

01:09:26.711 --> 01:09:29.145
And they're
in decent condition.

01:09:29.147 --> 01:09:32.716
And they probably haven't been played or
seen the light of day in over 30 years.

01:09:32.718 --> 01:09:35.484
But can't you just get
the music somewhere else?

01:09:35.487 --> 01:09:37.953
No, darling,
this is not that.

01:09:37.956 --> 01:09:39.488
But you can just download it.

01:09:39.491 --> 01:09:42.426
- Honey, don't.
- No... Yes, but no.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:44.160
Because then it doesn't exist.

01:09:44.162 --> 01:09:47.430
Trust me.
This is what I do for a living.

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:48.768
Okay.

01:09:49.902 --> 01:09:51.037
All right.

01:09:56.075 --> 01:09:57.173
What are you doing?

01:09:57.175 --> 01:09:59.109
No, I...

01:09:59.111 --> 01:10:01.779
I just...
I don't need anything.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:04.080
Oh, my God.
Suddenly you're so content.

01:10:04.082 --> 01:10:07.751
Well, why... why would I bring
all this stuff into my room

01:10:07.753 --> 01:10:09.988
just to move it again
in August?

01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:13.058
She makes a very good point.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.726
I mean, who are you? I don't...

01:10:16.728 --> 01:10:18.761
You know it's a good point.
Doesn't make sense.

01:10:18.763 --> 01:10:20.631
No, it actually...

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:23.467
So, how long am I gonna
have to stay and help?

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:27.104
Are you... Okay, uh, this is...

01:10:27.106 --> 01:10:29.672
I was thinking I could go up to
Kathleen's lake house with her and Marie.

01:10:29.674 --> 01:10:31.708
They invited me. I could
be back Sunday afternoon,

01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:33.543
if you guys
are still gonna be here.

01:10:33.545 --> 01:10:35.678
No, you can't go, sweetheart.
You can't.

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:38.015
I'm sorry. You can't go.
I told you about it...

01:10:38.017 --> 01:10:39.816
Donna, it's fine.
I don't care.

01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:41.985
We can do this together. I don't mind.
Let her go to her friend's.

01:10:41.987 --> 01:10:44.555
Please stay out of it. This isn't...
This really isn't...

01:10:44.557 --> 01:10:47.190
This has nothing to do with you,
but it's just...

01:10:47.192 --> 01:10:50.993
We made an agreement, and I just
expect you to stick by it, that's all.

01:10:50.995 --> 01:10:54.565
No, I will. And I know...
I know that it matters.

01:10:54.567 --> 01:10:58.037
It's just hard for me to understand
what this all means to you.

01:11:00.039 --> 01:11:06.877
I get that you grew up with it and
that it's probably always been here.

01:11:06.879 --> 01:11:10.213
There's just a lot of it,
and it takes up so much space.

01:11:10.215 --> 01:11:13.816
Space that we don't
even have, Mom, so...

01:11:13.818 --> 01:11:17.055
I'm just a little confused.
That's all.

01:11:20.259 --> 01:11:21.757
I mean...

01:11:21.759 --> 01:11:24.962
I do like these, uh,

01:11:24.964 --> 01:11:28.030
little grandma-y things.

01:11:29.168 --> 01:11:30.734
But... I don't know.

01:11:30.736 --> 01:11:32.869
I mean,

01:11:32.871 --> 01:11:36.606
being up here,
it... it isn't fun.

01:11:36.608 --> 01:11:41.878
And it doesn't remind me
of spending time here.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.218
I actually never
even came up here.

01:11:47.152 --> 01:11:51.788
So most of this stuff is stuff
that I've never actually seen.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:57.964
I mean, most of it is probably where
it has been since before I was born.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.936
So...

01:12:05.137 --> 01:12:07.974
this is...
this is your space, not mine.

01:12:12.777 --> 01:12:15.611
Uh...

01:12:15.613 --> 01:12:18.485
But it's really cool that
you both are so into it, and...

01:12:20.553 --> 01:12:24.288
I mean, I'm happy
that I get to see you,

01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:26.989
that you flew here
to see us, so...

01:12:26.991 --> 01:12:29.728
Yeah. Me, too.

01:12:31.095 --> 01:12:32.264
Me, too.

01:12:33.799 --> 01:12:37.199
Uh, so I'm... I'm glad
you found your records,

01:12:37.201 --> 01:12:41.337
and if you come by
some cool tunes or whatever,

01:12:41.339 --> 01:12:44.209
you can just send me the name,
and I'll download them.

01:12:45.710 --> 01:12:48.811
- Deal.
- Uh...

01:12:48.813 --> 01:12:52.218
But Kathleen keeps texting me.
Can I go or not?

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.122
Thank you.

01:12:59.157 --> 01:13:00.692
I love you both.

01:14:21.372 --> 01:14:23.977
<i>"Being away from
you and the kids is just awful.</i>

01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:27.977
<i>I told them
now that Donna is born,</i>

01:14:27.979 --> 01:14:30.116
<i>I can't go
on company business as often.</i>

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:39.722
<i>I thought you'd appreciate
the enclosed photograph.</i>

01:14:39.724 --> 01:14:42.324
<i>I bought it at the gas station,
along with a Coke.</i>

01:14:42.326 --> 01:14:44.761
<i>And it cost a nickel, but they
said I could just have it,</i>

01:14:44.763 --> 01:14:47.963
<i>on account of how thirsty I looked
and how badly I needed the Coke.</i>

01:14:47.965 --> 01:14:50.233
<i>I left my change on the counter.</i>

01:14:50.235 --> 01:14:52.871
<i>I'll be home by the time
this arrives, most likely."</i>

01:14:57.409 --> 01:15:01.110
<i>"Please show the enclosed clipping

01:15:01.112 --> 01:15:04.013
<i>I think he'll be amused by the
sizable collection of geodes</i>

01:15:04.015 --> 01:15:06.315
<i>that this town
prides themselves on.</i>

01:15:06.317 --> 01:15:08.318
<i>Had I known
I would be in Arkansas</i>

<i>during their
annual geode festival,</i>

01:15:10.455 --> 01:15:12.855
<i>I would have made an effort

<i>Do not tell him, but I will
bring him home a souvenir geode</i>

01:15:15.294 --> 01:15:17.263

from a merchant in town."</i>

01:15:19.865 --> 01:15:22.132
<i>"Sweetheart,
I cannot express my excitement</i>

01:15:22.134 --> 01:15:24.333

01:17:18.349 --> 01:17:19.518
Jesus.

01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:28.294
Hello.

01:17:30.128 --> 01:17:31.264
Hello.

01:17:58.122 --> 01:17:59.922
Hello.

01:18:01.526 --> 01:18:05.031
What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Whoa, whoa. Slow down. What?

01:18:05.664 --> 01:18:07.032
What?

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.408
<i>Tallie...</i>

01:18:19.978 --> 01:18:21.110
Oh, God.

01:18:21.112 --> 01:18:22.378
Oh, Donna. Oh, God.

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.316
Um... Oh. Um...

01:18:25.416 --> 01:18:26.585
Uh...

01:18:44.937 --> 01:18:46.606
<i>Only one of them made it.</i>

01:18:49.607 --> 01:18:53.111
Police got ahold of us
at 3:00...

01:18:54.545 --> 01:18:55.981
3:30.

01:18:58.517 --> 01:19:02.088
A drunk had crossed over the line
and drove them off the road.

01:19:03.287 --> 01:19:05.491
I guess they never had a chance.

01:19:10.228 --> 01:19:14.066
They said, uh, she had died...

01:19:15.701 --> 01:19:18.271
before the ambulance
ever got there.

01:19:39.223 --> 01:19:40.927
I'm sorry.

01:20:25.269 --> 01:20:27.572
Why?

01:20:30.207 --> 01:20:32.074
Come here, baby. Come here.

01:20:35.781 --> 01:20:38.451
Oh, God, no!

01:20:40.152 --> 01:20:43.319
I got you.
I got you. I got you.

01:20:43.321 --> 01:20:46.459
- I got you.
- No! No!

01:21:43.714 --> 01:21:46.684
I wanna fucking do something.

01:21:50.522 --> 01:21:54.423
I can't. I don't want... I don't
want anyone to fucking touch me!

01:21:54.425 --> 01:21:56.128
Don't fucking...

01:21:58.629 --> 01:22:02.398
I don't know what to do. I don't
know what to do.

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.566
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Let's take a walk.

01:22:04.568 --> 01:22:06.336
- No, no. What do I do?
- Let's take a walk.

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:08.471
I don't wanna walk.
I don't want to.

01:22:08.473 --> 01:22:11.341
- Let's be outside.
- I don't want to walk.

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:14.146
I don't wanna...

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:40.572
I'll get it.
I'll get it. I'll get it.

01:22:41.939 --> 01:22:43.442
Oh, fuck.

01:22:54.619 --> 01:22:58.187
Yeah, it'll be helpful, but
just give us a couple of hours.

01:22:58.189 --> 01:23:00.422
I think we'll have...

01:23:00.424 --> 01:23:02.225
We'll be ready.

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:03.496
Okay?

01:23:04.595 --> 01:23:06.529
Okay. Thank you.

01:23:34.625 --> 01:23:37.362
Why don't you go see...

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:49.942
I'm sorry.

01:23:55.246 --> 01:23:56.980
Sorry.

01:23:56.982 --> 01:23:59.518
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

01:24:00.951 --> 01:24:03.619
Kathleen's
going to be okay.

01:24:03.621 --> 01:24:05.557
She should be fine.

01:24:07.892 --> 01:24:09.628
Thank God.

01:24:11.429 --> 01:24:14.633
I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.

01:24:16.567 --> 01:24:20.869
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay, listen...

01:24:20.871 --> 01:24:24.709
We all wish they
were both here. Okay?

01:24:28.946 --> 01:24:31.413
- Was it a phone call?
- Hi, sweetie. Hi, Hillary.

01:24:31.415 --> 01:24:34.016
Um, yeah. It was a phone call,

01:24:34.018 --> 01:24:37.753
um, around 3:15.

01:24:37.755 --> 01:24:39.622
Right.

01:24:39.624 --> 01:24:43.059
I guess it wouldn't make sense that
they would go to your house, too.

01:24:43.061 --> 01:24:46.361
I mean, they wouldn't
do that, would they?

01:24:46.363 --> 01:24:47.566
Oh.

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:52.502
I woke up... I woke up...

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:56.806
I woke up and then a car...
I heard a car pull up.

01:24:56.808 --> 01:24:57.843
And then...

01:25:01.879 --> 01:25:05.515
the door slammed, and...

01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:07.816
and there was...
there was these...

01:25:07.818 --> 01:25:10.019
f... footsteps.

01:25:10.021 --> 01:25:12.491
Really slow footsteps. And...

01:25:13.558 --> 01:25:15.027
I, uh...

01:25:17.461 --> 01:25:20.062
I thought maybe that
she had come home, you know,

01:25:20.064 --> 01:25:21.634
that maybe the trip ended early.

01:25:23.067 --> 01:25:27.537
And then we heard knocks
on the door and, um...

01:25:27.539 --> 01:25:30.006
- There was two guys.
- Yeah.

01:25:30.008 --> 01:25:33.512
- They were so... They were so sweet.
- Yeah.

01:25:39.651 --> 01:25:40.585
Young.

01:25:44.656 --> 01:25:47.890
Their job is just to come
and tell a mother...

01:25:47.892 --> 01:25:50.396
outta fucking nowhere...

01:25:51.629 --> 01:25:53.663
that, you know...

01:25:53.665 --> 01:25:55.565
that her daughter's...

01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:57.002
that her daughter's...

01:26:01.071 --> 01:26:03.374
She's gone. Gone away.

01:26:06.811 --> 01:26:10.014
"Your daughter's gone."

01:26:11.549 --> 01:26:14.586
- Gone.
- We're so sorry.

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.523
I'm so sorry.

01:27:32.863 --> 01:27:35.032
- Hey.
- Yeah.

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:38.967
You okay?

01:27:38.969 --> 01:27:41.002
She had her computer with her.

01:27:41.004 --> 01:27:43.909
And her phone, of course.

01:27:47.144 --> 01:27:49.881
Both completely destroyed.

01:27:51.883 --> 01:27:53.152
What does that mean?

01:27:54.619 --> 01:27:57.022
It means
we don't have anything.

01:27:59.189 --> 01:28:02.928
I mean, there's access to everything...
computer, e-mail, text.

01:28:05.162 --> 01:28:09.500
She left everything open. I never even
thought about asking for a password.

01:28:11.236 --> 01:28:14.136
I'm down there,
trying to plan this memorial

01:28:14.138 --> 01:28:16.204
and realized we don't have
any recent photographs.

01:28:16.206 --> 01:28:19.177
We've got, like, two. She took 100 a day.
We didn't.

01:28:20.777 --> 01:28:22.177
Donna wanted
to play some music,

01:28:22.179 --> 01:28:25.114
and we realized
we don't know where that is

01:28:25.116 --> 01:28:29.153
or how to get it
or even so much what it was.

01:28:34.925 --> 01:28:37.293
Did she have an older phone?

01:28:37.295 --> 01:28:39.794
No.

01:28:39.796 --> 01:28:42.567
She wiped it clean.
Donated it.

01:28:43.835 --> 01:28:46.538
Twenty years ago,
somebody dies...

01:28:48.305 --> 01:28:52.842
you could find
some dog-eared book and open it,

01:28:52.844 --> 01:28:55.948
see a passage
they'd underlined, read it.

01:28:58.650 --> 01:29:01.217
You could find an album,

01:29:01.219 --> 01:29:03.822
look at where it was worn and...

01:29:05.822 --> 01:29:08.259
find the song they liked
and play it.

01:29:11.963 --> 01:29:14.233
You could find a roll of film...

01:29:16.134 --> 01:29:17.603
and develop...

01:29:23.907 --> 01:29:25.510
We don't have anything.

01:29:56.874 --> 01:29:58.610
That one's familiar.

01:30:01.345 --> 01:30:03.180
She liked that one.

01:37:58.522 --> 01:37:59.587
Hey.

01:37:59.589 --> 01:38:01.191
Hi.

01:38:02.326 --> 01:38:03.659
What's all that?

01:38:03.661 --> 01:38:06.127
Half the house.

01:38:06.129 --> 01:38:08.565
I took some of the stuff from your
storage unit. I hope you don't mind.

01:38:10.366 --> 01:38:13.569
The Dumpster's being picked up tomorrow.
All right?

01:38:13.571 --> 01:38:15.436
I wanna take
all this stuff off your plate.

01:38:15.438 --> 01:38:16.673
Don't want you
to worry about it.

01:38:18.409 --> 01:38:19.744
This stuff...

01:38:22.412 --> 01:38:25.646
is from the Dumpster.

01:38:25.648 --> 01:38:27.716
Most of it, anyway.

01:38:27.718 --> 01:38:29.687
Some of it's from the attic.

01:38:31.488 --> 01:38:34.523
You know, it's, like, letters.
Dad to Mom, Mom to Dad.

01:38:34.525 --> 01:38:38.228
Nothing earth-shattering. But it
shouldn't have been in the Dumpster.

01:38:39.796 --> 01:38:42.898
- You looked at it?
- Some, yeah.

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:44.669
Why do you
think I kept it?

01:38:46.804 --> 01:38:48.807
Come here.

01:38:50.174 --> 01:38:51.907
There.

01:38:54.478 --> 01:38:57.082
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:38:58.214 --> 01:39:00.649
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:39:00.651 --> 01:39:02.353
I'll be there for you.

01:39:04.254 --> 01:39:05.887
- Got me?
- Yeah.

01:39:05.889 --> 01:39:07.588
All right, Donna.

01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:08.726
Come here.

01:39:24.808 --> 01:39:26.842
All right.

01:39:26.844 --> 01:39:30.611
You don't have to go back
to that house. It's all done.

01:39:30.613 --> 01:39:32.648
It's all taken care of.

01:39:32.650 --> 01:39:35.219
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:39:36.586 --> 01:39:39.557
That house is
the last place you saw her.

01:39:40.823 --> 01:39:42.460
So maybe...

01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.662
maybe one day we'll drive by
and we'll say hi.

01:39:46.664 --> 01:39:49.200
The house
isn't going anywhere.

01:39:51.434 --> 01:39:53.204
It's just a house.

01:39:54.571 --> 01:39:55.739
Right?

01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.344
Right? Right.

01:40:04.447 --> 01:40:06.215
I gotta go.

01:40:06.217 --> 01:40:07.849
Okay.
You leaving?

01:40:07.851 --> 01:40:09.420
Not forever.

01:40:11.388 --> 01:40:12.490
Just for now.

01:41:58.629 --> 01:42:00.598
You guys,
I'll be back, okay?

01:42:08.004 --> 01:42:09.740
Hi, Kathleen.

01:42:11.575 --> 01:42:15.077
You... You look like you're
doing pretty well there.

01:42:15.079 --> 01:42:17.048
Yeah, I am. Thank you.

01:42:21.585 --> 01:42:24.055
I won't ask how things
have been, though.

01:42:25.555 --> 01:42:27.788
That would be stupid.

01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:29.893
It's been
a trying few weeks.

01:42:31.562 --> 01:42:33.564
Believe me, I know.

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.503
How much longer do you
have to be on those?

01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:45.507
My... My physical therapist thinks
maybe only another few weeks.

01:42:45.509 --> 01:42:48.413
At first they were saying it
could be the end of the summer.

01:42:50.714 --> 01:42:52.950
Well, it's good
to see you up and around.

01:42:55.719 --> 01:42:59.788
Thank you for coming
to visit me in the hospital.

01:42:59.790 --> 01:43:01.390
Of course.

01:43:01.392 --> 01:43:03.061
I mean,
I can't imagine what that...

01:43:04.061 --> 01:43:06.563
what that must be like for you.

01:43:28.619 --> 01:43:31.956
I hope that you
don't see me as some...

01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:35.856
reminder.

01:43:35.858 --> 01:43:39.660
I don't want you to look at me and ask
why I'm here instead of Tallie or Marie.

01:43:39.662 --> 01:43:43.164
We don't feel that way at all.

01:43:43.166 --> 01:43:44.535
We don't.

01:43:46.737 --> 01:43:48.139
I know, but...

01:43:49.138 --> 01:43:51.708
it'd be okay if you did.

01:43:52.742 --> 01:43:55.043
I think it sometimes.

01:43:55.045 --> 01:43:56.848
Well, you shouldn't.

01:43:58.182 --> 01:43:59.983
That's no way to think.

01:44:07.657 --> 01:44:09.727
I'll remember Tallie.

01:44:10.861 --> 01:44:12.897
I'll remember her so much.

01:44:17.034 --> 01:44:20.670
Do you know
what "saudade" means?

01:44:23.139 --> 01:44:27.177
Well, I wouldn't if I hadn't
have taken an SAT course.

01:44:29.012 --> 01:44:32.113
It's, um...

01:44:32.115 --> 01:44:36.586
a melancholy nostalgia for something
that perhaps hasn't happened.

01:44:40.957 --> 01:44:43.059
Well, I never got it.

01:44:44.827 --> 01:44:47.631
Tallie...
Tallie got it, though.

01:44:53.237 --> 01:44:56.874
"A pleasure you suffer,
an ailment you enjoy."

01:45:01.111 --> 01:45:06.818
A strong longing for something
that isn't... the present.

01:45:25.602 --> 01:45:30.204
Uh, on our way up to the lake we
stopped to get these key chains.

01:45:30.206 --> 01:45:32.673
It's like a...

01:45:32.675 --> 01:45:35.479
a little ritual that we had.

01:45:38.314 --> 01:45:42.253
Tallie took Marie, Marie took
me, and I took Tallie's.

01:45:52.595 --> 01:45:55.031
I don't know. It feels like
something that you should have.

01:46:12.214 --> 01:46:14.117
It's unfair, isn't it?

01:46:20.156 --> 01:46:24.092
There's gonna be so much
that she misses,

01:46:24.094 --> 01:46:25.993
like things that I know
she would like.

01:46:25.995 --> 01:46:27.130
Like...

01:46:29.131 --> 01:46:32.870
Like music and movies.

01:46:35.371 --> 01:46:37.008
Everything.

01:46:57.628 --> 01:47:01.933
I want you both to know that
I'll think about you every day.

01:47:11.907 --> 01:47:14.277
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:47:55.986 --> 01:47:57.354
<i>Love.</i>

01:47:59.055 --> 01:48:00.857
<i>The remainder.</i>

01:48:02.159 --> 01:48:04.359
<i>Hold it.</i>

01:48:04.361 --> 01:48:07.331
<i>It may be all you have left.</i>

01:48:08.732 --> 01:48:11.800
<i>Let it shine in you.</i>

01:48:11.802 --> 01:48:14.302
<i>And let it find you.</i>

01:48:14.304 --> 01:48:19.373
<i>Let it through that small,
unseen possibility</i>

01:48:19.375 --> 01:48:23.278
<i>and wrap its arms around you</i>

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:26.114
<i>to take you home.</i>
