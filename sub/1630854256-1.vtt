WEBVTT

01:57.351 --> 02:00.321
And you can feel free to call us
at lunchtime, if you want to.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.789
Uh, for what?

02:01.889 --> 02:03.023
Oh, um...

02:03.123 --> 02:04.425
just to let us know
how it's going.

02:04.525 --> 02:05.793
But you don't have to,
it's up to you.

02:05.893 --> 02:06.860
And you have our numbers
memorized in case, yeah?

02:06.960 --> 02:08.662
Uh, yes. They're in my phone.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.164
No, but you should
memorize them,

02:10.264 --> 02:11.665
in case your phone gets
lost or stolen or dies.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.033
Right, a-and if
you're experiencing

02:13.133 --> 02:14.535
any bullying
just call us immediately.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.637
You think I'm going
to get bullied?

02:16.737 --> 02:18.372
No, no, no. No.
No. Not at all. No.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.807
It just-- it was like
a theoretical.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.141
Just in case.
Yeah, of course,
but you should

02:21.242 --> 02:22.610
always remember your
self-defense training.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.278
And your active shooter drills. Yeah,

02:24.378 --> 02:25.679
but more importantly,
have fun.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.481
That's the most important thing,
just have fun.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.650
Okay.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.652
Okay. Also, uh, one of us
will pick you up today.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.153
But if not,
we'll text you,

02:33.254 --> 02:34.822
and maybe Naomi's mom
can drop you off at home.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.390
In which case, you have
your house key, yeah?

02:36.490 --> 02:37.425
Uh, yes. Great.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.426
And you know the alarm code?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.228
Yes.
Let's hear it.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.395
Real quick,
before you go.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.764
7-7-4-8.
Perfect.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.766
Yes. Ooh.
What about the panic code?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.167
7-7-0-0.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.902
Bingo. All right.
Anything else we're forgetting?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.304
High five.
It's gonna be great.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.405
You're gonna be great. Uh...

02:51.505 --> 02:52.440
I have to go
so I'm not late.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.674
Okay.
Okay. Bye.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.042
Have fun. Make friends. Bye.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.176
None of those--
none of the mean girls, though.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.945
We're proud of you.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.214
You know what I'm thinking?

03:00.314 --> 03:01.915
Homeschool.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.352
I'm not built for this.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.427
What are you doing?

03:14.995 --> 03:16.297
Lawn bowling.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.631
I mean, what the hell
it look like I'm doing?

03:17.731 --> 03:19.233
We have to be there
in 15 minutes.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.434
We have an appointment.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.303
I'm not going to
an adult day care.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.004
It's not a day care.

03:24.104 --> 03:25.138
It's an activity center.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.074
They have a gym,
a pool, a library.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.910
Well, then take me to a gym,
or pool, or a library.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.645
There, they have it all in one.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.847
What, they're gonna
change my diaper, too?

03:33.947 --> 03:35.716
If you need to wear one, yeah.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.951
Yeah, I'd bite a bullet
before I let that happen.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.722
Dad, they have classes,
guest speakers.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.824
Oh, whoopee,
I can read about ants

03:43.924 --> 03:46.560
and brush up on pole dancing.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.762
Just give it a try.

03:48.862 --> 03:49.830
Please.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.165
:
Okay. Okay.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.501
Do they have billiards?

03:53.601 --> 03:54.768
Yeah,
they got a whole game room.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.604
They even have
a poker tournament.

03:56.704 --> 03:57.805
Poker, huh?

03:57.905 --> 03:59.172
Ah, what's the buy-in?

03:59.273 --> 04:00.941
I don't know.
I think it's just for fun.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.811
Oh, the only fun is
when you're winning real money.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.112
Mrs. Williams will be there
to pick you up

04:05.212 --> 04:06.246
later this afternoon.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.315
Oh, so it's a suicide mission?

04:07.415 --> 04:08.482
I'd be safer walking.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.183
You ever see
that woman driving?

04:10.284 --> 04:12.420
I mean, she's legally blind.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.622
She's not legally blind.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.590
I mean, it's like
riding with Mr. Magoo.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.559
I need a helmet
to ride with that woman.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.829
Look, Dad, all I'm asking is
that you keep an open mind.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.631
All right? You may make
some new friends.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.734
Only new things that happen
in a place like that

04:26.834 --> 04:28.769
is hips and pacemakers.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.739
Soon as you get to know
somebody, they die.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.478
The only thing I like
about dating a woman my age...

04:37.578 --> 04:38.812
Mm-hmm.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.581
...is you don't have to
feel guilty

04:40.681 --> 04:42.783
about not calling her back.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.152
Why is that?

04:45.252 --> 04:48.255
Because most of them
can't remember.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.560
That's not funny.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.561
Ah, no, no, no,
that's funny.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.695
No, n-not really.

04:54.795 --> 04:55.763
That's "ooh-wee" funny.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.465
Get dressed, please.

04:57.565 --> 04:58.899
Damn funny.

04:58.999 --> 04:59.800
Not funny.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.068
Actually disrespectful.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.637
Come on. Come on, Dad.
We got to go.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.579
Hey, what you working on?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.614
Nothing.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.116
You need help?
With what?

05:16.917 --> 05:18.919
I'm really good
at planning things.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.454
Look, I know
that some guys

05:20.554 --> 05:22.956
can find this sort of thing
out of their wheelhouse.

05:23.056 --> 05:26.193
You were looking at
possible wedding venues, right?

05:27.628 --> 05:28.862
Maybe.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.565
Well, what is Anna thinking?

05:31.665 --> 05:33.567
Uh, she's thinking

05:33.667 --> 05:35.769
somewhere between the two of us
just going to city hall

05:35.869 --> 05:37.671
and fulfilling Arkady's desire

05:37.771 --> 05:39.172
of recreating <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>

05:39.272 --> 05:41.642
with everyone on horses
and real snow.

05:41.742 --> 05:42.910
:
Okay. Love.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.378
Well, do you have a theme?

05:45.379 --> 05:46.346
A theme?
Yeah.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.949
Like traditional or whimsical,

05:49.049 --> 05:50.283
uh, cosplay,

05:50.384 --> 05:51.685
new age, fairy tale?

05:51.785 --> 05:53.821
Fairy tale?
Mm-hmm.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.657
People come up with some
pretty wild things these days.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.158
I mean,
just think about it.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.159
Sam as a troll.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.394
Deeks as a pixie.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.162
Kilbride as a wizard.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.263
Yeah.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.732
Yeah, you know what?

06:04.832 --> 06:05.966
I'm gonna run it buy them,
see what they think.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.167
Ha! Yeah, please don't.
No, no, no.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.168
Honestly, I don't--

06:08.268 --> 06:09.369
It doesn't hurt to ask, right?

06:09.470 --> 06:10.838
:
I know you're kidding,

06:10.938 --> 06:12.272
but seriously, please don't.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.541
Agent Callen.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.643
Admiral needs you
in his office, ASAP.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.012
And good morning, Fatima.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.748
Morning.

06:21.549 --> 06:22.816
:
Okay.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.018
What's so urgent?

06:25.118 --> 06:26.687
I wasn't told, but I believe
it has something to do

06:26.787 --> 06:28.889
with a communiquÃ©
from Syria.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.059
Enter.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.328
You wanted to see me, Admiral?

06:35.429 --> 06:36.564
Hold my calls,

06:36.664 --> 06:37.865
have the Commander
patched through here.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.166
Sir.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.236
Commander Neal,
thank you for your patience.

06:43.336 --> 06:46.139
I'm here now with
Special Agent Grisha Callen.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.308
Can you tell him, please,
what your squad found?

06:48.408 --> 06:49.943
Yes, sir.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.311
We were doing
some joint recon work

06:51.411 --> 06:53.714
alongside the Syrian
Democratic Forces

06:53.814 --> 06:56.016
when we came across
an abandoned school

06:56.116 --> 06:57.985
that we had been using
as a shared safe house.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.153
It showed signs of an ambush
and human remains

07:00.253 --> 07:02.556
of several individuals
were found inside.

07:02.656 --> 07:05.192
They were burned
beyond recognition,

07:05.292 --> 07:07.127
but one of the bodies
had documents identifying them

07:07.227 --> 07:09.663
as an American female
named Trudy Chambers.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.405
The Trudy we know is
a small woman.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.675
Do the remains that you
recovered reflect that?

07:21.775 --> 07:23.376
I'm afraid so, sir.

07:23.477 --> 07:26.346
We're still waiting
on dental and DNA confirmation

07:26.446 --> 07:27.681
for a positive ID.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.617
Thank you, Commander.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.552
Please reach out
the moment you do.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.087
Aye, aye, sir.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.891
Well, you obviously know
that Trudy Chambers

07:37.991 --> 07:40.227
is one of Hetty's aliases.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.096
Yes.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.865
Yes, I do.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.915
What have we got?

08:02.015 --> 08:03.283
Explosion and subsequent fire

08:03.383 --> 08:04.384
at Havlock/Haines Aerospace
last night.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.353
They design and build

08:06.453 --> 08:07.855
remote piloted vehicles
for the Navy.

08:07.955 --> 08:08.922
A janitor was killed,

08:09.022 --> 08:11.825
a security guard
severely injured.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.995
ATF Bomb Squad said that it was
a nitroamine high explosive.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.730
Hmm. Octogen.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.965
Suspects?

08:18.065 --> 08:19.066
Not yet.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.133
Luis Estevez was the janitor.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.703
Morgan Reynolds was the guard.

08:22.803 --> 08:23.871
But neither fits
the profile.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.372
It seems more
like they were

08:25.472 --> 08:26.674
at the wrong place
at the wrong time,

08:26.774 --> 08:29.577
or the right place
at the wrong time,

08:29.677 --> 08:31.311
or the wrong place
at the right time.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.013
Whichever it is.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.348
Well, we still need
to check them both out.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.750
I'll take the crime scene
with Callen.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.886
Put Kensi and Deeks
on the janitor,

08:38.986 --> 08:41.021
and Rountree can work
the security guard.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.291
Problem?

08:44.391 --> 08:47.127
Sure you don't want to run this
by a more senior agent?

08:47.227 --> 08:48.461
No.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.763
You see a more senior agent
in here?

08:49.863 --> 08:52.332
I like it. Go get 'em, girl.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.101
Okay.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.740
Are her remains
being flown back?

08:59.840 --> 09:03.410
They will be, if they're
positively identified.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.848
I'd like to accompany them.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.084
Understood.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.553
You know, she was
with another American.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.522
Harris Keane.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.925
Any sign of him?
No.

09:18.025 --> 09:22.029
But we'll know better once
the forensics team is finished.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.698
If she was ambushed
in a safe house,

09:24.798 --> 09:26.199
someone sold her out.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.135
Even if that's not her,

09:28.235 --> 09:30.503
she's in danger.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.606
She was in danger
the minute she went back,

09:32.706 --> 09:34.842
and there's no such thing
as a safe house

09:34.942 --> 09:36.877
in Syria these days.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.346
But, then again, this is Hetty
we're talking about.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.615
She's got more lives
than a barn cat,

09:41.715 --> 09:43.884
and Lord knows
she's just as mean.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.255
<i>Thank you for talking with us
today, Miss Estevez.</i>

09:48.355 --> 09:51.091
We're so sorry about
the loss of your father.

09:52.059 --> 09:55.128
Uh, did he ever
talk to you about work?

09:56.630 --> 09:58.265
I know he liked it there.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.867
They paid him well,

09:59.967 --> 10:03.570
and the night job allowed him
to work days on other projects.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.505
What other projects?

10:05.605 --> 10:09.242
He was a skilled carpenter and
mason and worked construction.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.978
Geez, when did he sleep?

10:11.078 --> 10:12.179
Sundays.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.681
He would come over to dinner

10:13.781 --> 10:16.083
and pass out during football.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.485
We'd just let him sleep.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.753
We'd turn up the volume
on the TV

10:19.853 --> 10:21.454
so we could hear it
over his snoring.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.824
Why the two jobs?

10:24.591 --> 10:27.394
In the beginning,
it was to make ends meet.

10:27.494 --> 10:30.097
He came over illegally
as a child.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.499
Later on, I think
he just liked to stay busy,

10:32.599 --> 10:34.735
especially after my mother died.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.771
Did he ever work
with explosives?

10:37.871 --> 10:38.972
No.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.941
Although he did love
his fireworks.

10:41.041 --> 10:44.211
Didn't matter if it was
New Year's, Fourth of July,

10:44.311 --> 10:47.080
Cinco de Mayo,
any excuse to put on a display

10:47.180 --> 10:49.817
for his family and neighbors.

10:49.917 --> 10:50.918
I can't tell you
how many times the police

10:51.018 --> 10:52.585
and fire department showed up.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.588
Your dad have any difficulties,
any problems?

10:56.389 --> 10:57.557
Like what?

10:57.657 --> 11:00.894
Like financial issues,
gambling, drugs?

11:00.994 --> 11:03.530
No, he was a gentle
and caring man.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.465
Any enemies?

11:05.565 --> 11:07.634
No. Everyone liked him.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.669
He would do anything
to help his friends,

11:09.770 --> 11:11.304
family, neighbors,
even strangers.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.973
And he lived alone?

11:14.574 --> 11:16.343
Since my mother passed, yes.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.111
When did your mother pass?

11:18.211 --> 11:19.446
It's been two years now.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.614
She died of COVID.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.152
I'm sorry. Sorry.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.288
I thought this was an accident
at the factory.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.290
Did something else happen?

11:30.390 --> 11:32.926
That's exactly what we're
trying to figure out.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.795
Do you think
it would be okay

11:34.895 --> 11:37.130
for us to take a look
at your father's house?

11:38.131 --> 11:39.699
I guess so.

11:40.633 --> 11:42.936
Thank you.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.708
Really?

11:48.809 --> 11:52.045
Yeah. My old show went
into syndication.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.681
Well, that's not exactly subtle.

11:54.782 --> 11:57.751
Well, this is L.A., baby.
You know, subtle stands out.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.922
Is everything okay?

12:04.457 --> 12:08.095
A recon unit in Syria found
the remains of a human body

12:08.195 --> 12:09.797
at an ambush site.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.265
It was carrying one
of Hetty's alias IDs.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.935
They haven't confirmed
whether or not it was her,

12:15.035 --> 12:16.603
but the...

12:16.703 --> 12:19.006
the size of the body matches.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.943
My God.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.979
I am so sorry.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.781
Is there anything
that we can do?

12:28.882 --> 12:30.483
Not now. Let's-let's just go.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.052
Okay. Yeah.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.289
<i>The security guard's a bust.</i>

12:36.389 --> 12:38.491
He's lawyered up,
and he's refusing to talk to us.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.759
And the doctor said

12:39.860 --> 12:41.294
he's in no condition
to be questioned.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.463
And yet he was in good enough
condition to hire a lawyer.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.497
Yeah, well,

12:44.597 --> 12:46.566
life can be funny that way.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.969
Well, inform his lawyer and
the medical staff that as soon

12:49.069 --> 12:51.504
as he can eat his Jell-O,
he better start talking.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.340
All right. Copy that.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.843
I can try to get a warrant
to search his residence,

12:55.943 --> 12:57.845
not sure we'll get it,
but it's worth a try.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.913
Do it, and also get
a list of his coworkers.

13:00.013 --> 13:04.617
Maybe they can shed some light
on this individual.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.286
We're still assessing
the damage.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.621
Plus rebuild time and
lost revenue and contracts

13:08.721 --> 13:09.857
in the interim.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.959
Any ideas who did this?

13:12.059 --> 13:13.827
Anarchists,
right-wing extremists,

13:13.927 --> 13:15.628
anti-war activists?

13:15.728 --> 13:18.398
Any industry rivals
or, uh, disgruntled employees?

13:18.498 --> 13:19.766
"E," all of the above.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.268
Not everyone
likes what we do,

13:21.368 --> 13:23.303
especially after we took on
military contracts.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.105
Did you lose any employees
after that?

13:25.205 --> 13:26.539
A few chose to leave

13:26.639 --> 13:28.675
over their conscientious
objections to manufacturing

13:28.775 --> 13:30.043
weapons of war.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.345
Can we get their contact info?
Of course.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.547
Although I don't think any of
them were capable of this.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.217
Have you had any trouble
in the past?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.818
Nothing as overt,

13:38.919 --> 13:41.088
but we've been subjected
to a relentless onslaught

13:41.188 --> 13:42.389
of cyberattacks.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.991
You know who's behind those?

13:44.091 --> 13:45.625
Not yet.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.228
It's Ops. Excuse me.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.598
Hey, what do you have?

13:51.698 --> 13:52.699
We just received

13:52.799 --> 13:54.401
a preliminary coroner's report.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.036
The janitor, Luis Estevez,

13:56.136 --> 13:59.372
was already dead several hours
before the explosion.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.585
If the janitor was killed
hours before the explosion,

14:12.685 --> 14:15.655
it would suggest that
they used him to get inside.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.324
Makes sense.

14:17.424 --> 14:18.791
Nobody but the cleaning
crew or security

14:18.892 --> 14:19.859
working at night.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.161
It's easier access.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.362
They grab him,
use his ID.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.496
Hell, they probably brought

14:23.596 --> 14:24.631
the body in with the bomb,

14:24.731 --> 14:26.399
maybe in the cleaning cart.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.800
That's what I'd do.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.702
That's a little scary.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.572
But it is a good way
to dispose of the body.

14:32.672 --> 14:33.806
Probably hoped
it would look

14:33.907 --> 14:35.542
like he was killed
in the explosion.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.211
Well, let's see what turns up
at the residence.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.779
<i>No, I mean,</i>

14:39.879 --> 14:42.015
unless this is a Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde situation,

14:42.115 --> 14:43.616
honestly, I don't see it.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.519
I mean, this guy's like
Mister Rogers, just more neat.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.555
Ask the daughter if she has
power of attorney.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.790
If so, we may be able to access
his phone and financial records.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.559
I don't want to
miss anything.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.594
Will do. Yeah.
Did he have any home security?

14:54.694 --> 14:56.896
This guy wouldn't even
lock his doors.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.531
Well, whoever grabbed him must
have had surveillance on him.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.000
Maybe we can spot them.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.734
Yeah, we can ask the neighbors
if they have any

15:01.834 --> 15:03.436
home security cams.
Yeah, and see if the daughter

15:03.536 --> 15:05.372
can help you work up
what his daily routine was.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.773
Well, phone records will help

15:06.873 --> 15:08.875
and hopefully
his vehicle has GPS.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.577
Well, he left his Jeep at
the plant, but they're having it

15:10.677 --> 15:12.179
trailered over to the carport
for a full workup.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.546
Okay. Got it.

15:13.646 --> 15:14.647
We'll let you know
if we find anything here.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.616
Sounds good. Bye.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.785
Hey. They find anything?

15:18.885 --> 15:21.154
They're working up
his vehicle.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.390
I didn't think about his truck.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.558
Um, they will release it to you

15:25.658 --> 15:27.560
once they have a chance
to search for clues.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.862
He really loved that truck.

15:29.963 --> 15:33.866
It was the first new vehicle
he ever bought.

15:33.967 --> 15:37.370
Um, do you have
power of attorney?

15:38.405 --> 15:39.906
Yes.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.941
:
My father did that

15:42.042 --> 15:44.277
after my mother passed away,

15:44.377 --> 15:46.313
just in case.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.682
Would you allow us
to look through

15:49.782 --> 15:51.118
his financial
and phone records?

15:51.218 --> 15:52.485
It might help us find

15:52.585 --> 15:54.121
who's responsible
for all of this.

15:54.221 --> 15:56.423
:
Okay.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.426
Also, maybe can you help us
figure out his daily routine?

15:59.526 --> 16:01.294
Can you do that?

16:01.394 --> 16:03.330
I can try.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.898
Okay.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.939
Why does life have to
hurt so much sometimes?

16:13.040 --> 16:14.641
Well, maybe 'cause
it's so special

16:14.741 --> 16:16.609
that we experience
the most pain when it's gone.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.746
Although I do hear that kidney
stones are right up there.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.614
Really?

16:21.714 --> 16:23.450
What, you're gonna tell me
that childbirth is

16:23.550 --> 16:24.951
more painful than kidney stones?

16:25.052 --> 16:26.653
You're an idiot.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.921
I'm joking.
Why?

16:30.557 --> 16:31.891
Because if I don't joke,

16:31.991 --> 16:34.827
this job is too sad
for me to keep doing it.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.964
I know.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.600
I still think you're an idiot, though.

16:41.734 --> 16:42.935
Even though you're
a lovable idiot.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.904
I'll take it.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.409
You know,
all this is making me feel

16:49.509 --> 16:50.910
like I want to call Rosa
and check in on her.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.979
Okay, pull up on that stick
there, helicopter mom,

16:53.080 --> 16:54.447
because she's fine.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.948
You just need to give her
some space and time

16:56.049 --> 16:57.417
to find herself and-and to grow.
Put the phone down.

16:57.517 --> 16:58.785
Yeah, I know,
but how many parents

16:58.885 --> 17:00.253
dropped their kids off at school

17:00.353 --> 17:01.454
only to never see them again

17:01.554 --> 17:02.889
because of another
school shooting.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.624
Okay, y-you can't,
you can't think like that.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.126
How can you not think like that?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.561
I mean, all right, you can
consider the possibility,

17:08.661 --> 17:10.630
you can do the drills,
but at some point,

17:10.730 --> 17:13.633
you just have to give in
and believe in a greater good.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.504
I just feel like that's getting
harder and harder to do.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.072
Yeah, well,
that's why they call it faith.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.576
I mean, George Michael even
wrote a song about it.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.278
Oh... Please don't.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.313
Boy George?
Nope.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.480
George Harrison?

17:27.580 --> 17:29.382
Curious George?

17:29.482 --> 17:33.153
I mean, he's a monkey,
but he could write a song.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.558
What do you got, Dahr?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.327
Besides one dead janitor,

17:40.427 --> 17:42.562
an injured guard,
a demolished RPV factory,

17:42.662 --> 17:44.531
and no suspects,

17:44.631 --> 17:46.599
I'd say a whole lot of nothing.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.436
And what, pray tell,
are we doing to rectify that?

17:49.536 --> 17:50.837
Kensi and Deeks
are canvassing

17:50.937 --> 17:52.472
the janitor's neighborhood,
hoping to find

17:52.572 --> 17:54.174
a witness or something
on home security cameras.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.309
Callen and Fatima are

17:56.409 --> 17:57.577
going through his vehicle.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.045
Rountree is
interviewing employees

17:59.146 --> 18:01.047
who quit the company
over military contracts.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.115
And I'm still working

18:02.215 --> 18:03.583
with cyber to try and identify

18:03.683 --> 18:05.118
sources of their recent attacks. Hmm.

18:05.218 --> 18:08.221
Well, They're willing
to kill innocent people

18:08.321 --> 18:09.656
to accomplish their objectives,

18:09.756 --> 18:11.358
and they're using HMX,

18:11.458 --> 18:12.759
so they're not just some...

18:12.859 --> 18:15.027
run-of-the-mill militia idiots.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.529
No, this, uh...

18:16.629 --> 18:18.598
this feels professional.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.233
Corporate sabotage
from an industry rival?

18:20.333 --> 18:23.303
Mm.
Military contracts are
worth billions of dollars.

18:23.403 --> 18:26.105
Well, that would be a touch
better than the alternative.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.274
Which is what, sir?

18:27.374 --> 18:29.476
State sponsored terrorism.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.778
Keep pushing cyber.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.447
I want to know where those
initial attacks originated.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.549
Yes, sir.

18:42.155 --> 18:43.756
Admiral?

18:44.557 --> 18:46.125
Any news from Syria?

18:46.226 --> 18:49.662
I'd have informed you
if there were, Agent Callen.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.198
What have you got for me?

18:51.298 --> 18:52.799
Nothing yet.

18:52.899 --> 18:54.401
The people who did this
are still out there,

18:54.501 --> 18:56.803
probably with more
targets in mind.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.071
I need you focused
on the task at hand,

18:59.172 --> 19:02.609
not an unknown situation
half the globe away.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.178
Am I understood?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.181
Yes, sir. Good.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.519
Now go catch these bastards
before they strike again.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.661
Here you go.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.964
Whoever took him
wiped this thing clean.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.334
I can still smell the bleach.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.035
Any news on Hetty?

19:29.135 --> 19:30.036
No.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.407
All good?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.175
Yeah, it's just
my sister calling.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.845
I'm sure she just wants to know

19:38.945 --> 19:40.112
if I want to do something
with Jake. Aw.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.315
How fun.
Wish I had a niece or nephew.

19:42.415 --> 19:45.051
Yeah, well,
at least while they're young.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.254
Turns out
the world's coolest uncle

19:47.354 --> 19:50.156
is not as interesting these days
as an adolescent girl.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.324
Ah...

19:51.424 --> 19:53.092
I see.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.495
Just out of curiosity,

19:55.595 --> 19:57.196
did you give yourself
the designation

19:57.297 --> 19:58.431
of world's coolest uncle?

19:58.531 --> 20:00.066
Who's cooler than me?

20:01.634 --> 20:03.436
You don't think I'm cool?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.037
What? No. Yeah.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.073
Yeah, you're cool.
You're, like, supercool.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.842
Okay, let's...
let's not oversell it.

20:12.645 --> 20:13.613
<i>Hey, Shyla.</i>

20:13.713 --> 20:14.981
Janice Ng will be here in ten.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.783
I just sent you over
her background info.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.585
She quit Havlock/Haines
over her opposition

20:18.685 --> 20:21.020
to their military contracts.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.221
Oh, no.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.423
That doesn't necessarily
mean anything.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.358
No, but this does.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.926
Cyber finally identified

20:27.026 --> 20:28.761
the source of the computer
attacks on Havlock/Haines.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.563
Foreign or domestic?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.632
Foreign.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.166
Beirut.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.347
Lebanon is an ally.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.015
Yeah, but Hezbollah is not.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.950
They're not only a militant
group in that country,

20:51.050 --> 20:52.585
they're a successful
political party.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.554
Well, we've known they have
operatives in this country

20:54.654 --> 20:57.056
ever since the arrest of
Ali Kourani and Samir el-Debek

20:57.156 --> 20:58.190
a couple years ago.

20:58.291 --> 20:59.326
Weren't most
of those operations

20:59.426 --> 21:01.027
to raise money
and secure weapons?

21:01.127 --> 21:02.695
Yeah, but things change.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.664
Especially as our relationship
with Iran worsens.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.999
Iran is like Hezbollah's
sugar daddy.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.601
You find anything
in Estevez's truck?

21:08.701 --> 21:11.338
Nah, it was wiped clean,
and the GPS history was deleted.

21:11.438 --> 21:14.507
Oof, that's sophisticated,
even for Hezbollah.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.775
Why don't you reach out
to the ODNI,

21:15.875 --> 21:17.209
see if you can get
the most recent list

21:17.310 --> 21:18.645
of Hezbollah members
in this country,

21:18.745 --> 21:20.480
especially anyone
on the west coast.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.648
Got it.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.786
I joined Havlock/Haines
as an aeronautical engineer

21:26.886 --> 21:29.689
because I wanted to be part
of the first mission to Mars,

21:29.789 --> 21:32.158
not create
weapons of mass destruction.

21:32.258 --> 21:34.961
RPVs aren't
weapons of mass destruction.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.597
They are if they're armed
with nuclear weapons.

21:37.697 --> 21:38.798
Which they aren't.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.199
Don't be so naive.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.968
You don't think
they've considered

21:42.068 --> 21:44.537
and tested them for
small yield delivery weapons?

21:45.772 --> 21:47.239
Who am I talking to?

21:47.340 --> 21:49.342
It's your job to cover up
their crimes against humanity.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.310
Oh, I love that game.

21:51.411 --> 21:54.313
Listen, it's not our job
to cover up anything.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.248
In fact, it's our job

21:56.349 --> 21:58.084
to find the truth,

21:58.184 --> 22:00.319
which is why
we're trying to ascertain

22:00.420 --> 22:02.455
who set the bomb in
your former employer's facility.

22:02.555 --> 22:06.859
Ah, and because I quit for
not wanting to be a warmonger,

22:06.959 --> 22:08.461
I'm a suspect.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.862
So...

22:09.962 --> 22:12.264
is this where you beat
a confession out of me?

22:12.365 --> 22:14.166
This place
makes more sense now.

22:15.134 --> 22:18.270
I'm not gonna be the one
to beat a confession out of you.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.672
That's actually what,
uh, she's here for.

22:19.772 --> 22:20.740
What? No, no, n-no.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.008
He's joking.
He's just kidding.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.342
Deeks, tell her you're kidding.

22:23.443 --> 22:24.544
I'm not kidding!
Oh, my gosh,
he's kidding.

22:24.644 --> 22:25.878
Hmm?
Sorry, he's totally kidding.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.849
Special Agent Kensi Blye,
this is Janice Ng.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.117
She used to work

22:31.217 --> 22:33.285
at Havlock/Haines
but recently quit

22:33.386 --> 22:35.154
when they started handling
military contracts.

22:35.254 --> 22:37.356
Huh. I can respect that. Yeah.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.091
Right.
She seems to believe

22:39.191 --> 22:40.827
that we're covering
something up.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.895
Okay. What exactly
are we meant to be covering up?

22:42.995 --> 22:46.433
I want a lawyer.
Janice, you don't need a lawyer.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.234
Oh, so you can railroad me?

22:49.736 --> 22:51.804
You know what?
You're free to go.

22:51.904 --> 22:52.905
Please.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.674
Go.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.144
You're still gonna hear
from my lawyer.

22:58.244 --> 22:59.846
All right,
have a good afternoon,

22:59.946 --> 23:01.247
:
and don't let the door
hit you on the ass

23:01.347 --> 23:02.849
on the way out.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.317
It's one of those days,
isn't it?

23:05.418 --> 23:08.020
You have no idea.
I have nothing.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.656
What about you?

23:09.756 --> 23:11.624
What's the latest
with the Beirut cyberattacks?

23:11.724 --> 23:13.460
They're thinking it's Hezbollah.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.662
We were been gathering security
cam footage of the homes

23:15.762 --> 23:17.363
around Luis Estevez's house,

23:17.464 --> 23:19.231
and of course we would've
taken it to OPS ourselves,

23:19.331 --> 23:21.968
but somebody
needed a potty break!

23:22.068 --> 23:23.870
Sorry that I have a natural

23:23.970 --> 23:25.505
and justifiable-- ah--
aversion...

23:25.605 --> 23:27.273
Oh.
What?
...to public restrooms.

23:27.373 --> 23:28.575
Sorry, out of towels.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.443
Okay.
I think it got in my mouth.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.344
Yeah, he's a sensitive flower.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.313
Hey, Shyla.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.882
What's with
the Hezbollah message?

23:35.982 --> 23:38.585
Cyberattacks on Havlock/Haines
originated in Beirut.

23:38.685 --> 23:40.620
Current theory is Hezbollah.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.355
You have anything?
Uh, not sure yet.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.792
I'm sending you
home security footage

23:45.892 --> 23:47.026
from the deceased
janitor's neighborhood.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.260
Copy that.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.361
We'll compare it
to other footage we have

23:49.462 --> 23:50.697
of Estevez going about his day,

23:50.797 --> 23:52.599
see if we can find
a common element.

23:52.699 --> 23:54.501
There's a lot of stuff on there.
Deeks and I are heading back,

23:54.601 --> 23:55.702
so we'll help you
sift through it.

23:55.802 --> 23:56.869
Sounds good.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.139
All right.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.508
<i>The coroner's report</i>

24:01.608 --> 24:03.943
<i>has Estevez's death
around 4:00 p.m.</i>

24:04.043 --> 24:05.144
Hey, check this out.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.245
What am I looking at?

24:06.345 --> 24:07.714
See in the corner.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.415
Bunny's Laundry
and Dry Cleaning van.
Mm-hmm.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.618
It's there at 11:00.

24:13.352 --> 24:14.821
Still there two hours later.

24:14.921 --> 24:18.357
So, they could be taking
a long lunch or the day off.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.927
Or having a stakeout.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.463
Bunny Vale laundry is a chain
throughout the Southland.

24:24.564 --> 24:27.299
And when we started looking
for this specific van,

24:27.399 --> 24:28.701
it showed up
in multiple locations

24:28.801 --> 24:30.770
at the same time
as Estevez.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.138
And the owner is...?

24:32.238 --> 24:33.606
Currently it's one Darius

24:33.706 --> 24:36.643
aka "Bunny" Vale
and his wife, Sara.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.711
Lebanese-American.
Persian-American.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.479
First generation
born in the US.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.449
Any links to Hezbollah?
None that I could find.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.284
Could be using his business
as a front.

24:45.384 --> 24:47.887
Are you suggesting
they're "laundering" money?

24:47.987 --> 24:49.889
Sorry.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.223
Couldn't resist.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.694
I think we need to have
a talk with Bunny Vale.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.068
That's one of your vans?

25:02.168 --> 25:04.070
Yes, I have over a dozen.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.505
Hmm. Well, we believe
that this one was used

25:06.606 --> 25:08.507
in the commission of a crime.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.176
I was afraid of that.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.177
That's the one
that was stolen.

25:11.277 --> 25:13.279
Your van was stolen?

25:13.379 --> 25:15.081
Yes, just the other night. Hmm.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.183
You didn't file a police report.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.018
Oh, I didn't know it was stolen.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.319
And then when I did,

25:20.419 --> 25:22.589
one of my employees found it
before I could.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.390
There was no damage,
so I figured

25:24.490 --> 25:27.694
it was just some teenagers
on a joyride.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.528
They did empty the gas tank.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.463
Hmm.
Where did your employee
find the van?

25:31.564 --> 25:33.900
Just down the street
from one of my locations.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.502
Mm-hmm.
What was this employee's name?

25:36.603 --> 25:38.504
Emelio. Good kid.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.306
Been with me for years.

25:40.406 --> 25:41.941
Hmm.

25:43.009 --> 25:44.944
Anything else?

25:51.383 --> 25:53.085
That is what remains
of Luis Estevez,

25:53.185 --> 25:55.554
a father, grandfather,

25:55.655 --> 25:57.423
Who was probably murdered
in your van.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.025
So, once forensics is done
going through it

25:59.125 --> 26:00.993
with a fine-tooth comb,
any evidence they find

26:01.093 --> 26:02.194
will link you

26:02.294 --> 26:03.362
to his murder.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.131
Not to mention
a terrorist bombing

26:05.231 --> 26:06.532
on American soil.

26:08.534 --> 26:10.202
How long have you, uh,
supported Hezbollah?

26:10.302 --> 26:13.472
What? No. Nothing. Never.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.207
Nothing never?

26:15.307 --> 26:16.976
Sounds like a Taylor Swift song.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.778
You try and play us,
Bunny, you're gonna be
in Guantanamo Bay

26:18.878 --> 26:21.147
with your extremist brothers
before dinner.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.049
I had nothing to do with this.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.517
Then who did?

26:29.088 --> 26:30.690
Last chance, Bunny.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.793
I can't help you.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.527
They'll hurt my family.

26:35.628 --> 26:36.863
We can protect your family.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.898
Not in Tehran.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.002
We have agents
all over the world.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.236
But not in Iran.

26:44.336 --> 26:45.938
You're not in Iran, Bunny.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.140
You're in
the United States of America,

26:48.240 --> 26:50.509
and whoever is behind this
is a threat

26:50.609 --> 26:52.011
to you and your family.

26:52.879 --> 26:54.781
Tell us who they are,

26:54.881 --> 26:56.716
so we can stop them
from hurting anyone else.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.687
I don't know. Two men.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.455
They demanded a van,
they said

27:03.555 --> 27:04.857
if I didn't cooperate

27:04.957 --> 27:06.425
my relatives back in Iran
would pay the price.

27:06.525 --> 27:08.761
I was told to ask no questions
and tell no one.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.097
I just gave them the van to use.

27:11.197 --> 27:12.264
And then they returned it.

27:12.364 --> 27:13.565
Where were they staying?

27:13.666 --> 27:15.334
I don't know.
I only gave them the van.

27:15.434 --> 27:16.736
Did they approach anyone else?

27:18.304 --> 27:19.806
Bunny.

27:27.613 --> 27:29.148
My friend Ava.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.449
They threatened her, too.

27:30.549 --> 27:31.483
What did they want from her?

27:31.583 --> 27:33.119
A place to work.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.587
She's in commercial real estate.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.890
Call in Sam, we're gonna
need the full team on this.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.191
Yeah.

27:51.137 --> 27:52.905
Nice of you
to finally join us.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.774
Trust me, I'd rather
be chasing bad guys

27:54.874 --> 27:57.143
than trying to convince
my father to behave himself.

27:57.243 --> 27:58.477
How's he doing?

27:58.577 --> 28:00.612
He's doing everything he can
to drive me crazy.

28:00.713 --> 28:03.049
If you all are finished chitchatting,

28:03.149 --> 28:05.752
maybe we could get
this operation started.

28:09.155 --> 28:10.990
The building is owned
by Ava Safari.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.492
It's only about 26% occupancy

28:13.592 --> 28:14.660
since COVID wiped out
most of her tenants.

28:14.761 --> 28:15.895
The office
that she gave them

28:15.995 --> 28:18.230
is on a floor
that's otherwise vacant.

28:18.330 --> 28:21.968
Good. Last thing we need are
collateral casualties.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.602
Consider these people armed.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.171
We know they're dangerous,

28:25.271 --> 28:26.873
and they have access
to high explosives,

28:26.973 --> 28:29.308
so watch out
for booby traps.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.944
I'm sor--
What, bo-booby trap?

28:32.044 --> 28:33.880
Wait, nobody said anything
about a booby trap.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.714
I'm not the bomb disposal guy.

28:35.815 --> 28:37.616
Maybe Sam should be
coming in here first.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.252
They're not expecting company,
Deeks, you'll be fine.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.453
Probably.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.689
"Probably."

28:48.160 --> 28:49.796
Whoa. What are you
doing in here?

28:49.896 --> 28:52.464
Oh, hey. I didn't know this
place was rented again. Cool.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.901
I'm L.A. Fire, here for
the monthly inspection.

28:55.001 --> 28:56.769
You can't do that now.
Come back tomorrow.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.170
Oh, cannot do that.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.006
Starting the triple seven tower tomorrow.

29:00.106 --> 29:01.841
:
Nakatomi Plaza.
You're heard of it.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.876
But this will only take
a second. Is anybody else here?

29:03.976 --> 29:05.411
Because they may want
to step out into the hall.

29:05.511 --> 29:07.814
It's about to get loud
when I turn on the alarm.

29:07.914 --> 29:09.348
I said no. You need
to leave right now.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.650
Oh, I'm so sorry, I can't hear
anything with these on.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.419
But, seriously, your ears
are gonna start ringing

29:13.519 --> 29:16.455
like you were at front row
of a MotÃ¶rhead concert.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.090
Weapon!

29:21.327 --> 29:22.461
Tango down.

29:22.561 --> 29:23.896
What?

29:23.996 --> 29:25.998
Oh! Oh.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.633
Wow.

29:27.733 --> 29:29.335
Bad guy down.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.170
We're good.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.504
Clear.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.605
Uh, we're clear in here.

29:33.705 --> 29:34.773
Nice shot, honey.

29:34.874 --> 29:35.774
Baby, that was way too close.

29:35.875 --> 29:36.809
That guy almost shot you

29:36.909 --> 29:37.910
in the back of the head.

29:38.010 --> 29:39.611
If I had a nickel
for every time

29:39.711 --> 29:40.646
I was almost shot
in the back of the head,

29:40.746 --> 29:41.747
I could take us all to Cabo.

29:41.848 --> 29:42.949
Actually, you know what?

29:43.049 --> 29:44.116
I was shot in the back
of the head.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.684
Darrel Dinkins.
I still got

29:45.784 --> 29:47.619
the BB right under my
scalp right there.

29:47.719 --> 29:49.655
You sure it didn't make its way
into your brain?

29:54.026 --> 29:55.828
God, I missed you today.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.030
I bet you did.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.510
All right, sending you photos
and fingerprints now.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.445
Got it.

30:13.545 --> 30:14.480
Uh, he's got
a cell phone on him.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.882
I'm assuming it's a burner.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.249
I'll send you the number
and the call history.

30:17.349 --> 30:18.650
See if you can find anything.

30:18.750 --> 30:19.919
Have any ID on him?

30:20.019 --> 30:21.387
I got a Canadian
passport here

30:21.487 --> 30:24.356
identifies him
as one Cyrus Karimian.

30:24.456 --> 30:27.059
Born in Fort Erie, Ontario.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.494
Doubt it's real.

30:28.594 --> 30:29.996
Unfortunately,
I got four more passports here

30:30.096 --> 30:31.430
for different men, so either
this guy's selling these

30:31.530 --> 30:33.565
or we may have
a whole cell here.

30:33.665 --> 30:34.800
Wonderful.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.169
Did he have time
to warn the others?

30:37.269 --> 30:38.737
Highly doubtful.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.506
Any signs of where
the others might be?

30:40.606 --> 30:42.274
I mean, I'd like to think
they're visiting

30:42.374 --> 30:43.609
The Wizarding World
of Harry Potter,

30:43.709 --> 30:45.311
but they probably
have other plans.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.279
They've been, uh,
shredding documents.

30:47.379 --> 30:48.614
This one looks like
a topographical map.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.549
Can you tell what it was?

30:50.649 --> 30:52.818
I mean, maybe if I was
The Amazing Kreskin.

30:52.919 --> 30:54.353
Who's The Amazing Kreskin?

30:54.453 --> 30:55.587
Uh, that was before Google.

30:55.687 --> 30:56.956
Uh, I may have
something here.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.458
I sent you a photo.
You recognize this?

30:59.558 --> 31:01.793
Yeah. That's not good.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.795
Wait, "not good" like,
"aw, that sucks,"

31:03.896 --> 31:05.297
or "not good" like
"the phone call is coming

31:05.397 --> 31:07.033
from inside the house"?

31:07.133 --> 31:08.968
Uh, it's the symbol of
the Islamic Revolutionary

31:09.068 --> 31:10.602
Guard Corps' staff college.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.905
These guys aren't Hezbollah,
they're Quds Force.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.373
Iranian special operatives.

31:14.473 --> 31:15.574
Normally,
they only train proxies

31:15.674 --> 31:17.143
to fight in other conflicts.

31:17.243 --> 31:18.544
Son of a bitch.

31:18.644 --> 31:19.912
I knew this smelled
state sponsored.

31:20.012 --> 31:23.349
I will bet you my grandchildren
that the RPV

31:23.449 --> 31:25.217
that took out Soleimani
was manufactured

31:25.317 --> 31:26.752
by Havlock/Haines.

31:26.852 --> 31:29.221
You don't have grandchildren, sir.

31:29.321 --> 31:30.589
Right. Searching.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.824
Who's Keyser SÃ¶ze?

31:32.925 --> 31:34.526
He was an Iranian
military leader that killed

31:34.626 --> 31:36.162
by an RPV a couple years ago.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.163
He was a beloved hero

31:37.263 --> 31:38.464
in his country

31:38.564 --> 31:41.433
and this, Team America,
is payback.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.769
:
Team America. That's hilarious.

31:43.869 --> 31:45.237
You think this is funny,
Rountree?

31:45.337 --> 31:47.306
Uh... No, sir. Absolutely not.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.375
Any luck locating
the other numbers from the cell?

31:49.475 --> 31:51.343
Uh, looks like...

31:51.443 --> 31:52.945
they are traveling together

31:53.045 --> 31:55.314
or going in the same
direction on the PCH.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.950
Last cell tower to carry them
is just past Malibu.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.851
So maybe they're surfers?

32:01.988 --> 32:03.489
Point Mugu.

32:04.156 --> 32:07.493
Naval Station Ventura County
is the West Coast base

32:07.593 --> 32:10.529
for the Triton RPV project.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.098
Get the base commander
on the phone,

32:12.198 --> 32:13.832
and I want helicopters
on the roof of that building

32:13.932 --> 32:15.467
in two minutes.
How am I supposed to...

32:15.567 --> 32:16.935
I don't care.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.005
Coast Guard,
Sheriff's department, LAPD,

32:19.105 --> 32:22.208
hell, every TV and
radio station in the area

32:22.308 --> 32:23.976
has got traffic copters up.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.278
Commandeer every damn one
of them if you have to.

32:26.378 --> 32:27.713
Aye, aye, sir.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.898
Nobody's home.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.203
Call this a kill box.

33:57.303 --> 33:58.804
Drop your weapons, now.

34:03.342 --> 34:04.810
Allahu Akbar

34:04.910 --> 34:07.579
or behind bars,
it's your call.

34:14.653 --> 34:17.589
Move back slowly.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.426
Behind your back.

34:20.526 --> 34:22.328
Spread your legs.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.029
Walk. Let's go.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.734
Hey, uh...

34:28.834 --> 34:30.469
anybody got any ideas
on how I get down?

34:30.569 --> 34:31.670
I'm-a take this.

34:31.770 --> 34:32.471
Roundtree, you want to catch me?

34:32.571 --> 34:34.806
On three, ready?

34:34.906 --> 34:36.842
Everything okay, Mrs. Williams?

34:37.809 --> 34:39.545
What do you mean gone?

34:40.912 --> 34:42.514
Who?

34:43.482 --> 34:45.351
I have no idea who that is.

34:45.451 --> 34:48.053
Can you give me a number
or an address?

34:48.854 --> 34:50.055
You don't need to do
anything else.

34:50.156 --> 34:51.890
I'll take it from here,
all right?

34:51.990 --> 34:53.492
Okay.

34:53.592 --> 34:54.926
Trouble?

34:55.026 --> 34:57.062
When the caretaker arrived,

34:57.163 --> 34:59.698
my father had already left
the senior activity center.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.000
All right.
You need to look for him?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.269
I'd prefer not to.

35:03.369 --> 35:05.771
He left with another member,

35:05.871 --> 35:09.275
some woman named Victoria.

35:12.211 --> 35:15.147
Your father hooked up
with someone on his first day?

35:15.247 --> 35:16.715
Don't...

35:16.815 --> 35:18.150
That is impressive.
Don't start.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.152
He could teach you
a few things.
Don't start.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.326
Anybody want to grab a bite?

35:27.426 --> 35:29.027
Rountree's buying. Ooh.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.196
What? Seriously.

35:30.296 --> 35:31.597
I'll pay for drinks.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.499
Actually, I will buy dinner
if Rosa can come.

35:33.599 --> 35:34.800
Nah-ah-ah.
It's a school night.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.368
Nah-ah-ah.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.003
Terrible plan, because it is,
it is a school night.

35:38.103 --> 35:40.439
But if you guys want to
get takeout or something

35:40.539 --> 35:41.673
and eat at our place,
that's fine.

35:41.773 --> 35:42.874
Yeah, I'm down for that.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.443
We can hang out with Rosa. Amazing.

35:44.543 --> 35:45.644
How's you guys' calculus?

35:45.744 --> 35:47.313
Better than my algebra.

35:47.413 --> 35:48.314
Fantastic.

35:48.414 --> 35:50.048
How's your algebra?

35:50.148 --> 35:52.384
Eh...
Eh...

35:52.484 --> 35:54.653
We can work with that.
We can work with that.
Done. Hired.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.388
That's totally fine.
We got a new tutor.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.156
Rountree does math.

36:05.964 --> 36:07.233
Enter.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.972
Drink?

36:15.841 --> 36:17.309
Am I gonna need it?

36:17.409 --> 36:20.579
Well, the longer you stay
in this business, definitely,

36:20.679 --> 36:24.216
but not because of Hetty,
not now anyway.

36:24.316 --> 36:26.552
The, uh, remains that they found

36:26.652 --> 36:29.555
were those of a female child,
not Hetty.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.295
So, what is a dead girl doing
with one of Hetty's IDs on her?

36:36.395 --> 36:39.898
Well, if I had to guess,
Hetty planted it on the body.

36:39.998 --> 36:42.301
Without forensics,
that would probably

36:42.401 --> 36:45.170
convince whoever found the body
that Hetty was dead.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.906
Which would suggest
that she's in trouble.

36:49.007 --> 36:52.278
Like I said, she was in trouble
the minute she went back.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.982
I'd like permission
to go look for her.

36:57.849 --> 36:59.918
I'd like to have the knees
I had when I was 30,

37:00.018 --> 37:01.420
but it ain't happening.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.257
Now, maybe if we had
any actionable intel,

37:05.357 --> 37:07.626
but until that time,
she's on her own.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.330
Okay, well, I have plenty of
annual leave I can use.

37:11.430 --> 37:14.666
Give your head a shake,
Agent Callen.

37:14.766 --> 37:17.436
We just had
a foreign terrorist attack

37:17.536 --> 37:18.904
right in your own backyard,

37:19.004 --> 37:20.872
and you want to go
halfway around the world

37:20.972 --> 37:22.908
searching for
your surrogate mommy?

37:23.008 --> 37:24.576
Not a snowball's chance in hell.

37:29.781 --> 37:32.117
Enjoy your scotch.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.869
I intend to.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.422
Where the hell have you been?

38:11.423 --> 38:12.891
Well, I, uh,

38:12.991 --> 38:15.394
I took your advice
and made some new friends.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.128
You should have called me.

38:17.228 --> 38:18.664
I texted you.

38:18.764 --> 38:19.998
No, you didn't.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.434
You-you sure?

38:24.102 --> 38:25.604
Huh, I thought I did.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.005
Well, think again.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.376
What's the big deal, son?
I'm not a child.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.477
Well, you're acting like one.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.311
I mean, you hook up
with a woman

38:33.412 --> 38:35.681
on your first damn day.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.117
Well, for your information,

38:39.217 --> 38:41.953
her name is Victoria,
and she's married.

38:42.788 --> 38:43.955
Her husband, Cliff,

38:44.055 --> 38:45.857
also a veteran, is bedridden

38:45.957 --> 38:46.992
and can't get out.

38:47.092 --> 38:48.259
I went home to visit him

38:48.360 --> 38:51.830
and provide
some much-needed company.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.334
Sorry. I didn't realize.

38:56.435 --> 38:58.870
You didn't even give me
the benefit of the doubt.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.406
I'm going to bed.
I apologize, Dad.

39:00.506 --> 39:01.673
I...

39:01.773 --> 39:03.475
That's very kind of you.

39:03.575 --> 39:05.644
I'm sure
they both appreciate it.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.312
Well, they did.

39:09.581 --> 39:11.249
She more than him.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.751
Oh, I'm just glad

39:12.851 --> 39:15.787
that he was
as deaf as a doornail,

39:15.887 --> 39:17.389
if you know what I mean.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.526
She wore me out.

39:20.626 --> 39:22.293
You better be kidding me.

39:23.328 --> 39:24.362
Dad, come on.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.665
Good night, son.

39:26.765 --> 39:27.866
Dad.

39:27.966 --> 39:31.169
Dad.
