00:12.720 --> 00:14.080
I'm Fred Sirieix.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.760
I've worked in the
restaurant industry
for 25 years.

00:16.800 --> 00:21.280
Right now,
the UK's restaurant scene
is the envy of the world.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.720
And all it takes
is one great idea

00:23.760 --> 00:27.680
to make a fortune
on the high street.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.960
But has the next
generation of restaurants

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
got what it takes to become
a multi-million pound business?

00:34.040 --> 00:38.760
Over the next six weeks,
here in Manchester,
the food capital of the north,

00:38.800 --> 00:41.680
twelve of the most exciting
new restaurant ideas

00:41.720 --> 00:44.440
are in with a chance
of a life-changing investment

00:44.480 --> 00:48.120
from some of the UK's most
respected investors.

00:48.160 --> 00:52.880
These are the men and woman
who can turn an idea
into a national brand.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.840
We're looking at putting
a lot of money into the
absolute best concept.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.200
This is the kind of model
that you dream of.

00:59.240 --> 01:02.640
If I find the right operator,
I'll be fighting for it.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.000
[Fred] Each week,
the investors will give
the people behind

01:08.040 --> 01:10.920
two great new food ideas
a unique opportunity.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.720
Ah, this is brilliant!

01:12.760 --> 01:15.160
-[Fred] Their own
pop-up restaurant.
-[bell dings]

01:15.200 --> 01:16.520
Right, rock and roll, man.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.200
[Fred] They'll have
just three days to prove...

01:18.240 --> 01:20.240
Nobody seems to know
the table numbers.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.000
[Fred]
...they've got what it takes...

01:22.040 --> 01:23.960
-That's a disaster.
-[Fred] ...to make it
on the high street.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.840
When you start to rush,
that's when you start to make
more mistakes.

01:26.880 --> 01:29.160
-There's a big backlog of
customers at the door.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.760
What are you gonna
do about it?

01:30.800 --> 01:34.760
If I was to invest,
it'll take half a million
to £750,000.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.760
Time to make some dough.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.720
[Fred]
After the three days,

01:38.760 --> 01:41.600
will the investors walk
back into the restaurant...

01:41.640 --> 01:43.120
[sighs]

01:43.160 --> 01:44.360
[Fred]
...and make them an offer?

01:44.400 --> 01:46.480
It's a £600,000 lunch.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.360
We are not gonna leave
without an investment.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.440
I'm sorry, the time is up.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.960
The doors are open
for business.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.560
Welcome to
Million Pound Menu.

02:02.440 --> 02:05.560
[Fred] What does it take
to create a smash-hit
restaurant business?

02:05.600 --> 02:07.200
Speak to
a restaurant investor

02:07.240 --> 02:10.040
and they'll tell you
their decisions are based
on four things.

02:10.080 --> 02:13.440
The people, the idea,
the business,

02:13.480 --> 02:15.800
and above all, the food.

02:15.840 --> 02:19.800
That first bite, is it worth
hundreds of thousand
of pounds of investment?

02:21.920 --> 02:25.080
So what is the next big idea
to get us queuing for a table?

02:25.120 --> 02:27.400
We might be about to find out.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.160
So, this is our signature
Libertine Burger.

02:29.200 --> 02:33.720
Double ground beef patty,
American cheese,
bright pickles.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.520
[narrator] The men and woman
behind some of the most

02:35.560 --> 02:38.200
successful businesses
on the high street

02:38.240 --> 02:43.520
met to choose some of the best
new restaurant ideas for
a three-day trial run pop-up.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.520
[man] Jollof Box
is not a fast food.

02:46.560 --> 02:51.200
This is gourmet food,
come down, and taste
Africa in a box.

02:51.240 --> 02:52.680
Certainly got a lot of
energy about it.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.680
Reminds me a lot of
something I saw
in South Africa.

02:55.720 --> 02:59.240
[narrator] They were looking
for the two entrepreneurs
with the strongest food,

02:59.280 --> 03:01.640
brand, and business plan.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.960
We require an investment
of £225,000.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.400
[narrator] Then, each investor
had to decide whether they like
the concept enough

03:09.440 --> 03:11.240
to try it in Manchester.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.160
I can't think of a single place
it wouldn't work,

03:13.200 --> 03:15.440
I can't think of
a single person that
wouldn't want to eat it.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.240
I'm absolutely all over this.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.680
[narrator] The first idea
to get their attention,

03:19.720 --> 03:23.760
a husband and wife who want
to modernize an old-fashioned
English classic.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.320
Bubble and squeak,
a piece of mash potato with
a little bit of cabbage.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.800
It's very versatile.
You can put anything with it,

03:32.840 --> 03:34.480
but there's nothing
on the market
that shows people

03:34.520 --> 03:36.800
how good British food
actually is.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.440
Number seven!

03:38.480 --> 03:41.920
[narrator] Rupert and Marita
want £140,000

03:41.960 --> 03:45.400
to get Bubble&amp;
started on the High Street.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.760
Our vision is to launch
our first Bubble&amp; restaurants

03:48.800 --> 03:50.160
and then go national.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.320
And after that, international.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.440
I'm surprised no one's done
bubble and squeak before.

03:57.480 --> 03:58.520
I haven't seen it.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.480
-You got a base product...
-Potatoes.

04:00.520 --> 04:05.400
...which is effectively
rather stable in terms of price
like pasta and rice.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.720
My name is David Page.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.680
I was Chief Executive of
PizzaExpress.

04:09.720 --> 04:13.440
This bubble and squeak
looks like the classic
restaurant roll out.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.960
What you do need
is a filling base for any idea.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.640
So in pizza restaurant,
obviously the base,

04:19.680 --> 04:21.600
and then you can put
toppings on.

04:21.640 --> 04:25.400
And then they can flex
the pricing on the menu,
which is a very good idea.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.840
I would go here
to try it once as a novelty.

04:28.880 --> 04:33.080
But do people think that
people would return and have it
again and again and again?

04:33.120 --> 04:35.000
I quite like the concept,
to be honest,

04:35.040 --> 04:37.760
because humble potato
can be very creative.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.000
It's not just one flavor
you're looking at.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.520
My name is Atul Kochhar.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.000
I became the first Indian chef
to get a Michelin Star.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.280
This is quite
an exciting proposition,
to be honest.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.080
I know it's potato and cabbage.

04:48.120 --> 04:51.080
It's such a simple product,
but as chef I know
what all I can add to it

04:51.120 --> 04:52.200
to make it more exciting.

04:54.440 --> 04:55.920
My name is
Jay Morjaria,

04:55.960 --> 04:58.320
and I'm a food
and beverage consultant
based in London,

04:58.360 --> 05:00.440
and I'd like to introduce you
to my brand, Dynasty.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.160
[narrator] Next, a chef
who believes Britain's ready
to fall in love

05:04.200 --> 05:06.640
with sophisticated Korean food.

05:06.680 --> 05:10.800
It's a brand-new restaurant
concept serving modern,
east-Asian small plates,

05:10.840 --> 05:12.760
ideal for sharing.

05:12.800 --> 05:17.720
[narrator] Jay wants £600,000
to set up the first
vegan friendly Dynasty.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.720
[Jay] People who want
a new experience

05:19.760 --> 05:22.200
in a curious diner
is what we're going for,
really.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.320
And there's a lot
of them out there.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.880
I like that
it's a Korean fusion.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.800
It ticks a lot of boxes
in terms of being on trend.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.760
I'm Lydia Forte.
I work for my family business,

05:34.800 --> 05:38.440
a collection of luxury
five-star hotels across Europe.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.240
It looks fresh,
the dishes are appealing
and colorful,

05:41.280 --> 05:42.960
which are great for
an Instagram generation.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.360
But it's also healthy
but not too restrictive.

05:46.400 --> 05:50.840
I'm hoping that maybe
Korean is the new Peruvian.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.720
And I think it's great to be
able to offer something
which is exciting

05:53.760 --> 05:56.520
and bring in
a totally new clientele
to the space.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.160
Whilst it's focused
on the vegan
and plant-based sector,

06:00.200 --> 06:02.680
it will have meat and fish,
which I think
is very important,

06:02.720 --> 06:04.880
particularly,
we don't want to alienate
large groups of people.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.440
I'd very much
like to go out and meet Jay
and look at it further.

06:07.480 --> 06:08.720
Dynasty is
an interesting concept.

06:08.760 --> 06:12.840
The whole Asian cuisine market
is in ascendancy.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.920
It's a food category
that people enjoy.

06:14.960 --> 06:19.760
We are looking to find
the next big
casual-dining concept

06:19.800 --> 06:21.640
that will, you know,
sweep away the competition.

06:22.760 --> 06:24.800
[narrator]
The ideas have been chosen.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.760
With two investors
interested in each concept,

06:27.800 --> 06:31.400
there might be
a fight over Dynasty
and Bubble&amp;.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.280
[Fred]
Dynasty and Bubble&amp;
arrive in Manchester

06:45.320 --> 06:48.400
to open their doors
to the public
for the very first time.

06:48.440 --> 06:53.200
The next 72 hours
could well change their lives
and business fortune forever.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.680
Will they be able
to secure an investment

06:55.720 --> 06:58.880
from some of the most
respected restaurant investors
in the country,

06:58.920 --> 07:00.360
or will they leave
empty-handed?

07:04.000 --> 07:07.920
[narrator] The two ideas
will take over identical
existing restaurant sites

07:07.960 --> 07:10.560
just 100 yards apart.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.680
Today,
Marita and Rupert, and Jay

07:13.720 --> 07:16.920
are about to see
their new restaurants
for the first time.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.760
-Oh, look!
-[chuckles]

07:21.120 --> 07:23.360
-Bubble&amp;.
-That's our restaurant.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.200
-Oh, my God.
-Ah, it looks great.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.920
[narrator] Over the last month,
they've been working
with a designer

07:30.960 --> 07:33.160
to being their
restaurant to life.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.160
This is so tangible now.

07:35.200 --> 07:37.480
-[gasps] Look at the
living wall.
-They've done it, look.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.680
They've done a good job.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.560
It's real.
You can touch it.

07:45.040 --> 07:48.200
[narrator] Four years ago,
Rupert and Marita
gambled everything

07:48.240 --> 07:51.440
and set up a stall
selling bubble and squeak
on the south coast.

07:51.480 --> 07:52.920
[Marita]
What can I get for you?

07:52.960 --> 07:54.680
-Can I get a large
classic squeak, please?
-You got it.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.000
[Rupert]
Came home from work one day
and said to my wife,

07:57.040 --> 07:59.000
"What do you think
of this idea of
bubble and squeak?"

07:59.040 --> 08:01.040
I was like, "Bubble and what?"

08:01.080 --> 08:03.960
By that time
we'd had one child
and then another.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
She had a baby girl
bouncing around
on the front, you know.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.440
Yeah, in the freezing cold,
you know, with her
little, like, snowsuit...

08:10.480 --> 08:11.720
[Rupert]
Customers loved it, though.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.120
[Marita]
They probably felt
sorry for us...

08:13.160 --> 08:15.240
[both chuckle]

08:15.280 --> 08:19.080
Look at that American lady
in Winchester

08:19.120 --> 08:21.360
talking about
bubble and squeak.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.320
[narrator]
Their foods won awards,

08:23.360 --> 08:27.680
and now the customers queue
to pay between seven
and ten pounds a dish.

08:27.720 --> 08:33.400
Rupert and Marita
want an investor to commit
£140,000 to help them grow.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.680
It's like a child, isn't it?
The child just wants you
to believe in them, you know.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.080
It's just kind of
like that thing.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.720
You just want the investor
to believe in you and say,

08:39.760 --> 08:41.480
"Yeah, that's exactly
what I want.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.320
"I can see
where you're going."

08:50.120 --> 08:53.200
[narrator] Opposite Bubble&amp;,
42-year-old Jay Morjaria

08:53.240 --> 08:56.560
is also about to see
his restaurant
for the first time.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.560
[Jay chuckles]

08:58.600 --> 09:00.280
Oh, wow!

09:00.320 --> 09:02.200
Looks really cool.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.960
Oh, my God.
I love the bamboo and the...

09:04.000 --> 09:06.480
Oh, my God,
my light box.

09:06.520 --> 09:10.040
I never thought
I'd see that up
in, like, that big.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.040
[narrator] Seven years ago,
Jay gave up his job
as a furniture buyer

09:17.080 --> 09:19.600
to train as a chef.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.560
Now, he's a consultant
for other people's restaurants

09:22.600 --> 09:26.440
and runs Dynasty
as an occasional supper club.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.000
[Jay] My parents ran Indian
vegetarian restaurants,

09:29.040 --> 09:31.040
so cooking's always been
a passion for me,

09:31.080 --> 09:33.680
and one of the things
I've always enjoyed
is Korean food.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.440
So I decided that
I was gonna spend
a bit of time in Korea.

09:36.480 --> 09:41.360
I worked in restaurants
to learn a bit more about
the traditional Korean cooking,

09:41.400 --> 09:43.280
but I've always wanted
to own a restaurant.

09:43.320 --> 09:46.880
[narrator] Jay's looking for
£600,000 to open Dynasty

09:46.920 --> 09:51.400
so he can establish the first
of a collection of restaurants.

09:51.440 --> 09:52.960
Sorry.
I'm getting emotional now.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.120
It's just been
a massive journey for me.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.760
I feel that I've got
the right concept,
I've got the right experience.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.720
It's everything that
I've kind of just wanted
for such a long time now.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.960
So, yeah, I want it bad.
[chuckles]

10:11.880 --> 10:14.600
[narrator] Both restaurants
have brought their
own teams to help.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.440
Six at a time,
into the ice water,

10:16.480 --> 10:18.440
and do it like
one minute 45, okay?

10:18.480 --> 10:21.200
Could you work over there?
'Cause that's garlic.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.440
[narrator] Jay met Rebecca
at a food fair.

10:23.480 --> 10:26.960
Tonight, she'll be
front of house at Dynasty.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.800
[Rebecca] For anybody
that hasn't tried Korean food,

10:28.840 --> 10:32.920
I think this will be,
like, a great, like,
first experience for them.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.320
[narrator] Tomorrow,
in just 24 hours,

10:35.360 --> 10:39.560
the investors will be arriving
for a private lunch.

10:39.600 --> 10:43.600
So, this evening,
both restaurants will open
to the Manchester public

10:43.640 --> 10:46.040
for their one and only
practice run.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.200
It's their soft launch
with 50% off.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.880
It will test every part
of their service.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.640
Not everything will go
according to plan,

10:53.680 --> 10:55.360
but that's the whole point.

10:55.400 --> 10:59.120
They need to be ready
for when the investors
arrive tomorrow.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.560
-Good morning.
-[Marita] Good morning.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.320
-I'm Fred, how are you?
-Hi, I'm Marita, how are you?

11:02.360 --> 11:03.800
-Marita, nice to meet you.
-You, too.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.720
Tell me what is
this concept Bubble&amp;?

11:06.760 --> 11:09.000
Bubble&amp;, yes.
It's all about
bubble and squeak.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.960
So, was it like
a eureka moment for you?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.640
Well, it was for me, yeah,

11:12.680 --> 11:14.840
and when I got
the support from Marita,
"Great idea, great idea,"

11:14.880 --> 11:16.440
it was like,
"Okay, now you
just got to do it."

11:16.480 --> 11:17.880
So what's your vision for it?

11:17.920 --> 11:20.000
I mean, is it like
a one-site operation...

11:20.040 --> 11:21.440
-No.
-Or is it something
you want to roll out?

11:21.480 --> 11:24.080
-No.
-[Marita]
We'd love to see it globally,

11:24.120 --> 11:26.120
-if possible. Why not?
-[Fred] Globally.
World domination.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.200
-Bubble&amp;, New York.
Why not?
-[Fred] I get it.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.360
-It's classic...
-And it hits the heart of
a lot of English people.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.800
-Family values.
It's very important.
-Oh, 100 percent.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.560
But it's never done before,

11:34.600 --> 11:37.000
so for me I can't help
to think this is either genius
or the other way.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.840
We're going genius.
[laughs]

11:38.880 --> 11:40.560
Great.
Well, listen,
have a great day.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.080
You got, I'm sure,
a lot of work to do
with your mise en place.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.360
And I'll see you later on.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.160
[Fred]
Rupert and Marita
are a great team.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.920
They believe in their product.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.640
But in a restaurant,
we hardly invent anything.
We recycle.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.480
There are only so many
genuinely new ideas.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.160
So it's either those guys
had a moment of genius,

12:00.200 --> 12:02.520
or there's a reason why
it hasn't been done before.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.200
[narrator] Rupert spent years
working as a head chef,

12:07.240 --> 12:09.720
and his menu
and prices tonight

12:09.760 --> 12:13.320
have been adapted
for a restaurant setting.

12:13.360 --> 12:18.200
There's the classic
bubble and squeak topped with
organic egg and hollandaise

12:18.240 --> 12:20.120
at £11.

12:20.160 --> 12:24.800
Bubble and halloumi
cheese curry is also £11.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.160
And Rupert's new
seasonal special,

12:27.200 --> 12:32.360
bubble and wild
pheasant and sprouts,
costs £14.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.320
[Rupert] There's just
so much involved
in what I do.

12:34.360 --> 12:37.760
I'm almost putting
restaurant food
in a street-food scene.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.480
You know, I'm trying
to put something square into
a round hole sometimes.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.360
-Shiso is done.
-Yeah.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.080
[Jay]
Can you do the mix for
the tempura batter?

12:50.120 --> 12:52.600
[narrator] In Dynasty,
Jay's hoping Korean food

12:52.640 --> 12:55.520
will be part of
the growing trend
for Asian cuisine.

12:55.560 --> 13:01.640
One in six UK restaurants
is now Japanese,
Chinese, or Thai.

13:01.680 --> 13:05.680
At the heart of Korean cooking
is its famous spicy pickle.

13:05.720 --> 13:09.040
So, this is my, uh,
this is my kimchi,
my whole cabbage kimchi.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.920
Basically, kimchi is like
a staple in Korea.

13:11.960 --> 13:14.680
Every family has
their own recipe.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.720
It's secret in their family.
It's about 560 leaves,

13:18.760 --> 13:22.520
each one pasted,
by hand, with chili and garlic.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.360
[Fred] Morning. How are you?
I'm Fred, nice to meet you?

13:29.400 --> 13:30.960
Nice to meet you, Fred.
This is Rebecca.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.880
-Nice to meet you. How are you?
-Hi, nice to meet you. Hello.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.120
[Fred] So, why Korea?

13:34.160 --> 13:35.640
What is it that
you like about Korean food?

13:35.680 --> 13:37.560
-I love spice.
-[Fred] Right.

13:37.600 --> 13:41.480
But I also really like
all the other flavors like
garlic and soy and sesame.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.320
Are people ready
for Korean cuisine?

13:43.360 --> 13:47.280
I think we're at that point
where people want food
that's great taste,

13:47.320 --> 13:49.960
big bowl of flavors,
and all the dishes
are small plates.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.160
-Is it for sharing?
-It's for sharing, yeah.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.520
[Fred]
Are you big on your kimchi?

13:53.560 --> 13:56.080
-Yeah. Oh,
I can show you my kimchi.
-Yeah?

13:56.120 --> 13:57.600
-There you go.
-Thank you very much.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.320
Wow.
It's very, very good.
Very good.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.680
That level of expertise
is amazing.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.680
This is really
what Korean food is about.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.520
-If you
can't do kimchi...
-That's it.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.800
-Forget it.
-Get out of the game.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.120
-Yeah.
-[both chuckle]

14:14.160 --> 14:15.400
Good luck, Jay.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.960
-Nice to meet you.
-See you later.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.600
[narrator] Jay makes
everything on his menu
to order.

14:19.640 --> 14:24.280
Tonight, he'll be cooking
roasted pumpkin in a
Japanese curry sauce,

14:24.320 --> 14:26.120
priced £6.50.

14:26.160 --> 14:32.120
Charred wedges of hispi cabbage
with sweet miso,
tahini and apple at £7.

14:32.160 --> 14:34.880
And bibimbap,
fried Korean rice balls

14:34.920 --> 14:39.320
with seaweed and homemade
red-chili mayo at £3.50.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.880
[Jay]
There's a lot to do still,

14:40.920 --> 14:42.760
but as we're getting
through the prep
and ticking off things

14:42.800 --> 14:44.800
then you know that
it's starting to come together.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.520
It's getting closer
and closer to service
so, yeah.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.120
[narrator] It's 6:00 p.m.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.240
Doors open in an hour.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.480
Both Bubble&amp; and Dynasty

15:01.520 --> 15:04.960
will be joined by two
experienced local staff
to help with service.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.360
Welcome to Bubble&amp;.
Yeah, hello.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.560
I'm Marita from Bubble&amp;.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.720
-How are you?
-I'm good, thank you.

15:09.760 --> 15:14.920
[narrator] And Jay wants
every diner to receive a full
traditional Korean welcome.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.320
[Jay] People will
walk through the door

15:16.360 --> 15:20.280
and we will all
try and shout
welcome in Korean

15:20.320 --> 15:22.240
based on the cue
from you, Rebecca.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.000
[speaking Korean]

15:25.040 --> 15:26.640
Even if you don't
say it quite right,

15:26.680 --> 15:29.480
it will sound fine
when we all say it together.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.520
We're gonna say...
[speaks incorrect Korean]

15:34.480 --> 15:36.960
[in English] I forgot.
I don't know. I'll have to...
I'll have to read.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.440
I don't know

15:39.480 --> 15:41.160
Real customers are
gonna start walking
through the doors,

15:41.200 --> 15:43.360
so we need to just
smash it for them, yeah?

15:43.400 --> 15:45.400
What are we gonna say
whenever people walk in?

15:45.440 --> 15:47.080
[all speaking Korean]

15:47.120 --> 15:48.160
Let's do it. Come on.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.040
-Hi, guys.
-Hello.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.440
How are you?
Welcome to Bubble&amp;.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.600
Every service
is like a battle.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.800
The troops must be primed
and ready for anything.

16:03.840 --> 16:06.080
[greeting in Korean]

16:06.120 --> 16:08.520
Hello.
Welcome to Dynasty.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.760
[Fred]
Tonight, the customers expect
great food and great service,

16:11.800 --> 16:13.720
and nothing else will do.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.040
Two fried bibimbap,
one pumpkin.

16:16.080 --> 16:17.120
Yes, Chef.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.240
Hello. [greeting in Korean]

16:20.280 --> 16:22.160
[greeting in Korean]

16:22.200 --> 16:23.920
[Fred] Oh, very nice.
What a welcome.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.840
[waiter] So we're gonna go
with the bibimbap
and the mushroom stew.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.200
-I've got to have the kimchi.
-You've got to have the kimchi.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.440
[staff greeting in Korean]

16:31.480 --> 16:34.480
I love the welcome.
Its such a lovely touch.

16:34.520 --> 16:38.360
Something you just don't
think about having
when you see it.

16:38.400 --> 16:42.240
And then you usually
go, like, Indian or, like,
you know, steakhouse.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.400
-I think we're just gonna
order everything.
-Yeah?

16:44.440 --> 16:45.680
Is anyone listening to me?

16:45.720 --> 16:47.640
Okay, great. Aubergine.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.640
Four aubergine altogether.
One with chorizo.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.440
[narrator] He may never have
run Dynasty as
a restaurant before,

16:53.480 --> 16:57.320
but tonight, Jay wants
every plate to look
and taste the part.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.440
Order up, please.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.440
Jay is so intense in there.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.640
He's running the show
by himself almost.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.520
He's such a perfectionist.
He cooks everything
a la minute.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.880
It means cook to order.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.160
And that puts
a lot of pressure
on the kitchen.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.200
Aubergine, mushroom
and grill tempura...

17:14.240 --> 17:16.360
I'll do the mushrooms now.
Can you portion out
four kimchis for me?

17:16.400 --> 17:18.360
Otherwise,
we're not gonna be able
to get them out.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.480
[Jay] Very, very nervous,
a little bit panicked.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.200
We've got a lot to get done.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.520
It'll be two seconds
on your aubergine.
I'll just see where it is.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.320
Still waiting on food
for table one.

17:26.360 --> 17:28.920
So I need
one more aubergine,
mushroom with cauliflower.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.320
[Jay]
Yeah, that's gone.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.920
-They said they haven't had it.
-Okay, we'll do it.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.600
[Rebecca]
Table number five, yeah?

17:33.640 --> 17:35.840
-Table eight.
-Table number eight, sure.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.960
Here you go. Enjoy, guys.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.680
[narrator] But when
the food finally finds
its way to the table,

17:40.720 --> 17:42.760
the customers are impressed.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.160
Really nice texture,
really crispy.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.080
[woman] Very fresh as well.
[man] Yeah.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.200
Kimchi is very nice.
Enjoyed that a lot.

17:53.680 --> 17:54.760
This is amazing.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.800
Every little mouthful.

17:57.840 --> 18:01.640
I think some of the foods
were really simple as well,
like that cabbage.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.080
You probably won't think that
you'd get that
out of a cabbage.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.200
I'm actually gonna have
cabbage again after this.

18:06.240 --> 18:10.160
Well, you know, I could
eat like this maybe
two or three times a week.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.800
Then he'd have to go back
to his pasta...

18:11.840 --> 18:16.080
Then I'd have to go back
to my carbonara
and spaghetti bolognese.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.200
[all chuckling]

18:19.680 --> 18:23.520
[narrator] Tomorrow,
the investors arrive for
their private lunch.

18:23.560 --> 18:28.520
Tonight, Bubble&amp;'s customers
are about to have a first taste
of high-end

18:28.560 --> 18:30.520
fried mash and cabbage.

18:30.560 --> 18:35.360
Okay, new order.
Two lamb, one halloumi,
a greens and a carrots, okay?

18:35.400 --> 18:36.920
Hey, guys, are you all right?
Yeah?

18:36.960 --> 18:38.480
Is it okay for me
to get a dish?

18:38.520 --> 18:40.680
-[Rupert] Whichever
one you want.
-Maybe your classic.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.240
[Rupert] The classic?
Yeah, of course.
Why not.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.800
Perfect.
Thank you very much.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.960
That's delicious.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.080
[woman 1] Is it?
[woman 2] Mmm.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.520
[Fred] This is proper
English grub.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.600
Cabbage and potato.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.040
And they want to build
an empire out of it.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.120
[narrator] Bubble&amp;
will need repeat business

18:55.160 --> 18:58.560
if they're to capture
a slice of the average
£50 a week

18:58.600 --> 19:01.000
we now spend
on eating out.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.240
I like to see empty plates.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.840
Now, what is bubble and squeak?

19:04.880 --> 19:06.000
The squeak is different.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.160
Isn't the squeak different?

19:08.200 --> 19:10.200
[woman]
I think it's something
that everybody likes,

19:10.240 --> 19:12.640
but you'd never normally
base a meal around it.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.320
[woman 2]
Everything tasty.
It's spot on.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.280
However, I don't think
bubble and squeak

19:17.320 --> 19:19.240
has got legs
in this day and age,

19:19.280 --> 19:23.400
'cause bubble and squeak
is a dish served
in the war times.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.200
And I think with millennials
in this day and age,
they'll go,

19:26.240 --> 19:27.480
-"What...is that?"
-Yeah.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.000
Last night, both restaurants
felt the pressure.

19:39.040 --> 19:40.200
But that's to be expected.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.760
Good morning, guys.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.880
I know from experience
that every service
is an opportunity

19:43.920 --> 19:46.440
to learn, make corrections,
and do better.

19:46.480 --> 19:48.120
-Good morning.
-[Jay] Good morning.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.960
Today,
the investors are coming.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.440
Their food, their vision,
their financials must
stack up enough

19:53.480 --> 19:55.160
to get that vital investment.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.960
Uh, yeah,
put the sesame on top.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.320
Now I'm just
starting to feel
the pressure a little bit.

20:00.360 --> 20:03.040
Today, it's just
all or nothing on the food.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.800
It's a £600,000 lunch.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.400
Essentially what it is.

20:06.440 --> 20:10.400
I told my daughter
that my mascot
is a Korean tiger,

20:10.440 --> 20:12.840
so she wrote this
little message to me.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.040
She's my little taster,
she's my little everything.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.840
So, yeah,
it really is just nice

20:16.880 --> 20:19.320
to have a little support
from family.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.240
[narrator]
Over the next two days,

20:22.280 --> 20:24.840
the investors will test
the restaurants
customer service

20:24.880 --> 20:26.680
and business plans.

20:26.720 --> 20:31.080
But today's private lunch
in two hours time
is all about the food.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.960
It doesn't feel real,
the investment bit,
yet.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.520
Yeah, something you dream of.

20:34.560 --> 20:38.360
You're almost that far away
from having the restaurant.

20:38.400 --> 20:41.160
It just...
It feels almost tingly.
[laughs]

20:41.200 --> 20:42.760
-How are you? Good morning.
-[Marita] Good morning.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.360
-[Rupert] Morning, Fred.
-How's it going?

20:44.400 --> 20:45.760
You had a good night
last night?

20:45.800 --> 20:47.440
Yeah, very good.
Enjoyed last night.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.720
-The people liked it, huh?
-I think so.
We got a good response.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.360
Are you confident
you can produce
the same quality today?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.000
Yeah, definitely, yeah.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.640
Can you convince them
that there is room for
bubble and squeak

20:57.680 --> 20:59.320
as a concept
on the high street?

20:59.360 --> 21:02.640
I think so because
you go to a sushi restaurant,
you have sushi,

21:02.680 --> 21:04.480
you go to a pasta restaurant,
you have pasta.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.000
You go to bubble and squeak,
you're not just getting
bubble and squeak.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.720
It's bubble and squeak
plus more.

21:08.760 --> 21:11.040
The thing is it tastes good
because of you.

21:11.080 --> 21:13.040
-Because you can cook.
-Yeah, my recipe, everything.

21:13.080 --> 21:15.520
And if I'm not there,
they still get the same
quality product.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.040
Good, good.
Well, look,
I wish you good luck.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.760
-[Rupert] Cheers. Take care.
-Thank you.

21:24.360 --> 21:27.720
[narrator]
On Bubble&amp;'s guest list,
David Page.

21:27.760 --> 21:31.040
He's grown some of
the UK's biggest
restaurant brands

21:31.080 --> 21:35.840
including PizzaExpress,
Gourmet Burger Kitchen,
and Franco Manca.

21:35.880 --> 21:39.880
When I first got
involved in Pizza,
which was, uh, 1973,

21:39.920 --> 21:41.840
everybody thought
it was a fad.

21:41.880 --> 21:45.760
I tasted sushi 25 years ago
and I never thought
it would come to the UK.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.320
So I'm keen to be
part of the journey

21:48.360 --> 21:50.440
with people who
think of new ideas.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.440
And then you come
to the investment decision,

21:52.480 --> 21:56.200
which is,
is this product
ready for the UK market?

21:56.240 --> 21:58.680
Will it ever be ready
for the UK market?

21:58.720 --> 22:04.400
[narrator] David's competition
is international restaurateur
and chef, Atul Kochhar,

22:04.440 --> 22:07.000
looking to expand
his investment portfolio.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.440
I'm looking for opportunities
to be able to operate
on high street.

22:10.480 --> 22:14.440
Bubble and squeak can really
scale up in very big numbers,
in my opinion.

22:14.480 --> 22:17.640
The biggest challenge
is to standardize a product,

22:17.680 --> 22:20.280
so we have to keep
this product really simple
and straightforward.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.960
How they stretch
one basic product

22:25.000 --> 22:26.520
to encompass
a number of different tastes

22:26.560 --> 22:28.680
is gonna be
very interesting.

22:28.720 --> 22:32.440
It's only potato and cabbage,
but who knows? This might be
the real diamond.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.440
-[Marita] Hello.
-Hello.

22:34.480 --> 22:35.800
-[Marita] Welcome.
-How are you?

22:35.840 --> 22:37.480
Welcome to Bubble&amp;.
How are you?

22:37.520 --> 22:38.880
Hi, Atul. Rupert.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.560
Rupert, Atul.
It's good to meet you.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.280
Hello, David.
Nice to meet you.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.440
So there are house bubbles
and the seasonal bubbles.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.720
And they have three starters.

22:46.680 --> 22:47.960
It sounds like a good plan.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.280
Yeah. Bubble and pheasant?

22:50.320 --> 22:53.920
-Bit upmarket.
-Definitely.

22:53.960 --> 22:57.120
[narrator] Today,
Bubble&amp; will serve
all their starters,

22:57.160 --> 23:00.080
all their mains,
and all their puddings.

23:00.120 --> 23:03.280
[Marita] So what you have here
is our beautiful
smoked ham-hock starter.

23:03.320 --> 23:06.240
And here you have
our roasted golden
beetroot starter

23:06.280 --> 23:07.640
with some shallot crisps.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.360
-So bon appetit...
-Thank you very much.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.560
It's beautiful.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.120
It's more of
a fine-dining to me.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.800
Very posh and very lovely.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.360
It won't get many fans
anywhere other than
quite posh suburbs.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.240
It can't be humble restaurant.

23:24.280 --> 23:27.120
It's sort of completely
the antithesis of what
I thought I was gonna get.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.600
-Anyway, we'll see what happens
in the next course.
-Yeah.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.960
[narrator]
Dining at Dynasty today,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.600
five-star hotelier,
Lydia Forte.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.760
She's looking for new ideas
for her luxury hotels

23:43.800 --> 23:46.440
in the UK
and across Europe.

23:46.480 --> 23:49.000
It's really hard to find
the right idea.

23:49.040 --> 23:52.720
There's a lot of elements
that come together to make
a great concept.

23:52.760 --> 23:55.800
Jay is someone who has
a lot of experience
in the kitchen.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.960
And he's been to Korea.
He's spent a lot of time there.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.400
So I'm excited to see
what he's come up with.

24:02.440 --> 24:06.840
[narrator] Joining her,
Darrel Connell of food
and leisure group, Imbiba.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.640
They've invested over
50 million pounds

24:09.680 --> 24:12.400
in new bar
and restaurant chains.

24:12.440 --> 24:15.000
[Darrel] With Dynasty,
it depends how complex
the food is.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.320
If it's super
high-end Korean

24:17.360 --> 24:20.120
and very complicated,
I think that will struggle.

24:20.160 --> 24:23.000
There is a reason why
pizza restaurants
and burger restaurants

24:23.040 --> 24:26.120
are successful,
because everybody likes
pizzas and burgers.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.360
The consumer does not
want to be intimidated.

24:28.400 --> 24:32.480
The product needs
to appeal to many,
not just a one-off restaurant.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.720
[Lydia] I actually don't know
Korean food very well,

24:34.760 --> 24:37.480
but I'll be interested to see
how it comes across

24:37.520 --> 24:40.440
to an untrained
palette like me,

24:40.480 --> 24:42.560
because I think
a lot of customers
will be like me

24:42.600 --> 24:43.880
and haven't
experienced it yet.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.440
[both greeting in Korean]

24:46.480 --> 24:47.960
-Hello, hello.
-How are you?

24:48.000 --> 24:49.120
-Hi, how are you?
-Welcome.

24:49.160 --> 24:50.400
-Lydia.
-I'm Jay, nice to meet you.

24:50.440 --> 24:51.720
-Hi. Darrell.
-Nice to meet you.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.440
-Jay, very nice to meet you.
-This is Rebecca.

24:53.480 --> 24:56.320
What we're gonna do
for you today is kind of
the whole experience,

24:56.360 --> 24:58.160
so we're gonna bring out
the entire menu.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.960
[Darrel] So, it's obviously
plant-based.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.720
-Yes.
-And then you add meat.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.200
So, yeah, we kind of flipped
the script a little bit

25:04.240 --> 25:06.440
in the sense that,
if you go to
a regular restaurant,

25:06.480 --> 25:08.680
you'd have about
three or four options

25:08.720 --> 25:10.520
that are gonna be
vegetarian or vegan.

25:10.560 --> 25:12.480
Uh, what we've done is
we've done it
the other way around.

25:12.520 --> 25:14.000
So our hero is the veg.

25:14.040 --> 25:16.440
-Great. That's really exciting.
-[Jay] Thank you.

25:16.480 --> 25:20.640
[narrator] Jay's menu today
is a showcase
of his best dishes.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.760
Seaweed flat bread,
vegetable tempura,

25:23.800 --> 25:27.480
and fragrant shiso leaves
with plum ketchup.

25:27.520 --> 25:30.000
I can't think
what it's similar to.

25:30.040 --> 25:33.440
-From a culinary perspective,
it's quite intimidating.
-It is.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.200
I'm looking at
this menu thinking,
"What am I having?"

25:35.240 --> 25:36.720
God, I'm not quite sure.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.240
So, this is our bibimbap

25:39.280 --> 25:42.040
and then on top
is a gochujang mayo.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.320
-It does look great.
-[Darrel] It does.

25:43.360 --> 25:44.440
I like that
it's individual.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.520
That is really, really tasty.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.080
Mmm-hmm.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.720
[Rebecca]
This is a seasonal tempura.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.640
We have sweet potato
and shiso leaf.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.240
That is really
beautiful looking.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.160
Mmm-mmm.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.920
That's really yummy.

26:05.960 --> 26:07.600
This is really good tempura.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.440
It's really light.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.600
They seem to be
enjoying everything.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.280
And everything's going out
at a nice pace.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.800
And, yeah,
they seem to be smiling,
which is important.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.680
It's uh...
It looks like
it's going well.

26:20.440 --> 26:23.280
[Rebecca] Right, gentleman,
this is the bubble
and classic squeak.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.560
So this is the dish
that started it all.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.600
[narrator] At Bubble&amp;,
the bubble and squeak
mains are served.

26:33.280 --> 26:34.920
Mmm. Delicious.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.760
[Atul] How does it
taste with the egg? Good?

26:36.800 --> 26:38.560
[David] Mmm, pretty good egg.
Yeah, good quality egg.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.680
-Beautifully done.
-[David] Brilliant bacon.

26:40.720 --> 26:41.680
[Marita] Beautiful.

26:44.280 --> 26:46.280
Here is our beautiful
bubble and lamb.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.800
Actually, I think
it looks better
than it tastes.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.560
There's hardly any flavor,
to be honest.

26:53.600 --> 26:54.440
Yeah.

26:55.520 --> 26:57.280
[David] Hmm.

26:57.320 --> 27:00.960
It seems like they're having
a really good conversation
about every bite.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.200
They're really
studying it, like...

27:03.240 --> 27:04.600
[Rupert] Well, let's hope
it's a good thing.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.360
I don't know.
I don't know
if they're saying...

27:07.280 --> 27:09.240
I don't know.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.960
Yeah, I forgot the first one,
but I'll remember this.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

27:13.520 --> 27:17.400
This is the sage-roasted
pheasant breast
and confit leg.

27:17.440 --> 27:19.400
You've got some
glorious bread sauce there,

27:19.440 --> 27:21.760
which Rupert makes with
gluten-free bread crumbs.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.600
-[Atul] Go for it, David.
-Okay.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.320
It's very important
that they like it,

27:26.360 --> 27:29.240
because, otherwise,
there's no concept,
there's no way forward.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.280
If you don't like the food,
you're not gonna invest,
are you?

27:32.320 --> 27:34.360
-Nice.
-Hmm.

27:34.400 --> 27:38.000
In French casinos,
at the roulette table,
there is a very famous saying,

27:38.040 --> 27:39.840
[speaking French]

27:39.880 --> 27:43.200
[in English] Basically
it means, place your bets,
the wheel is spinning.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.920
And right now in Bubble&amp;,
the wheel is spinning.

27:47.200 --> 27:48.680
[David] My issue is the price.

27:48.720 --> 27:51.240
If they're gonna go
into that mid-market segment,

27:51.280 --> 27:54.880
they're competing
against a hamburger
of £7.95 or £8.95...

27:54.920 --> 27:58.520
Main courses were
between £11 to £16

27:58.560 --> 28:00.960
for potato and mash
and the topping.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.200
That's too expensive.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.240
-[Atul] Let's put
some numbers here.
-Yeah.

28:04.280 --> 28:05.720
-Six pounds for a starter.
-Yeah.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.800
And then £11 for
a bubble and squeak.

28:07.840 --> 28:10.360
-Yeah.
-That makes £17.

28:10.400 --> 28:13.480
-A glass of wine...
At least £5?
-At least.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.640
Twenty-two,
and maybe a dessert then.

28:15.680 --> 28:16.880
Twenty two and six.

28:16.920 --> 28:20.480
-Yeah, you're looking at...
-[whistles] £28.

28:20.520 --> 28:23.600
And 10 percent service charge,
so that makes it £30.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.400
Thirty quid a head.

28:25.440 --> 28:29.040
So we're sitting here,
and we've got to evaluate this
at 30 quid a head.

28:29.080 --> 28:31.880
Franca Manca is £9.50 a head.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.600
-So, £9.50 per head?
-That's our average spender.

28:34.640 --> 28:38.640
People can come in,
have a pizza and a drink
for less than £10.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.880
Some dishes were just
amazingly beautiful,

28:44.920 --> 28:46.320
some were not so.

28:46.360 --> 28:48.800
Now, as a business,
yes it's a great concept.

28:48.840 --> 28:52.520
Whether it works
as a restaurant,
I'm doubtful about it.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.200
Some really good cooking.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.520
Thank you, Atul.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.080
-Lovely host.
-Thank you.

28:57.120 --> 28:59.480
-See you soon. Take care.
-Bye-bye.

28:59.520 --> 29:02.200
I think there's quite a lot
of confusing messages in there.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.440
Now, if you're an investor
and you got a restaurant,

29:04.480 --> 29:08.080
you gotta grab hold of it
and understand every single
part of it.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.160
And that includes
the food being delicious,

29:10.200 --> 29:11.480
delivered at a right price,

29:11.520 --> 29:13.200
you like it
so you're proud of it,

29:13.240 --> 29:16.560
and you think that
the UK public will get it
straight away

29:16.600 --> 29:18.120
because it's something
they understand,

29:18.160 --> 29:20.520
they don't have
to think about it,
and it's the right price.

29:24.080 --> 29:27.480
I don't know about you,
but I haven't felt

29:27.520 --> 29:29.280
that I haven't eaten any meat.

29:29.320 --> 29:32.040
-Have you?
-[Darrel] Yeah, yeah.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.440
[chuckles]

29:33.480 --> 29:35.320
[Jay] We've got two versions.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.400
This is the mushroom,
and this is the lamb version

29:37.440 --> 29:39.600
with exactly the same stew,

29:39.640 --> 29:42.280
so the meat eaters don't feel
like they're missing out.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.480
[all laughing]

29:43.520 --> 29:45.400
-There's gonna be sort of...
-No, no, no, no.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.160
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.040
It's really nice.
It is really, really nice.

29:55.080 --> 29:59.160
Is it strong enough,
as a food offering,
to continue to come back?

30:00.800 --> 30:03.080
I loved tasting that food.

30:03.120 --> 30:07.160
It was really unusual,
but at the same time
approachable.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.920
Great selection of dishes.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.560
I think there were very
few dishes which weren't
really exceptional.

30:12.600 --> 30:13.840
[speaking Korean]

30:13.880 --> 30:16.640
The "quality of the food"
box has been ticked,

30:16.680 --> 30:19.880
so, that's one hurdle closer
to the finish line,
I think.

30:20.840 --> 30:21.920
Through the noren curtains.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.480
[Darrel] The food quality
was exceptional.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.920
Jay and the team
did a great job.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.480
Thank you very much.
Bye.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.120
[Darrel] We've seen that
he's a great chef,

30:28.160 --> 30:30.880
but it could be quite
an intimidating menu.

30:30.920 --> 30:35.360
And there are no, sort of,
safe, go-to dishes
on that menu.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.320
Obviously being plant-based,
there wasn't much meat,

30:38.360 --> 30:40.480
which is definitely a trend.

30:40.520 --> 30:42.320
Right. Shall we clear up?

30:43.040 --> 30:44.240
-Yes.
-Let's clear up.

30:47.480 --> 30:50.480
[narrator] Tomorrow lunchtime,
the pressure builds.

30:50.520 --> 30:53.920
The investors will see
how well the restaurants cope

30:53.960 --> 30:56.280
when they're full of
paying customers.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.800
But today isn't over.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.000
Jay and Rupert and Marita

31:01.040 --> 31:03.960
now face a high-stakes
business meeting,

31:04.000 --> 31:08.360
one hour with the investors
to go through their finances
and future plans.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.080
[all greeting in Korean]

31:11.120 --> 31:13.240
-How are you, guys?
-Yeah, good.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.640
-How did it go, Jay?
-I'm super positive about it.

31:15.680 --> 31:17.160
-Very good.
-[Jay] Yeah.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.720
So, in a few moments
you will have
the finance meeting.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.280
-Are you confident with that?
-Yeah.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.440
I... You know,
this is my strength,

31:22.480 --> 31:25.320
and that's why
I need to partner up
with someone

31:25.360 --> 31:27.040
whose strength is numbers.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.240
So you cook,
they do the numbers.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.840
-Perfect combination.
-Absolutely.
That's what it's about, right?

31:31.880 --> 31:34.080
-Great, great.
Listen, good luck.
-Thank you very much.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.520
-[speaking Korean]
-Take care. Bye.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.880
See you tomorrow.

31:43.920 --> 31:48.200
[narrator] Lydia and Darrel
see Dynasty as a serious
business opportunity,

31:48.240 --> 31:51.520
so they'll both have
a private meeting with Jay.

31:51.560 --> 31:55.440
Deciding whether
to go for Jay or not
is such a big decision

31:55.480 --> 31:57.960
because we have a limited
number of sites.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.280
And we actually have
a lot of choice

32:00.320 --> 32:01.960
in who we put
into those sites.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.200
Most chefs want to be
in luxury five-star hotels.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.880
[Darrel] The bar restaurant
sector in the UK, really,

32:07.920 --> 32:09.680
in a simple term,
fall into two counts.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.760
The business people
that happen to run restaurants,

32:11.800 --> 32:13.840
or the restaurateurs who happen
to run businesses.

32:13.880 --> 32:16.960
And Jay, that's a
restaurant guy first
and a business guy second.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.360
[Lydia] Hi, Jay.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.320
-How are you?
-Good to see you again.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.680
[narrator] Jay is asking
for a £600,000 investment.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.120
In a smart suit,
not like the other chefs.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.600
I'm more comfortable
in my whites, but yeah.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.800
I mean,
my experience today
was really great.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.840
I loved your concept.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.400
The way that you've evolved
the Korean food,

32:42.440 --> 32:45.120
you're riding on the wave
of something which is
a Korean trend

32:45.160 --> 32:46.720
-which is starting to happen,
which I like.
-Yeah.

32:46.760 --> 32:49.120
-It's modern Asian.
-Exactly.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.440
Actually, what was
really fascinating...
Your food was really different.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.080
The proposition was really...

32:54.120 --> 32:57.080
I genuinely couldn't think
of any culinary experience

32:57.120 --> 32:59.480
that I've had recently
that was in any way similar.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.360
-Honestly,
that means so much...
-It's true.

33:02.400 --> 33:05.080
-So I was just looking
at your business plan...
-Sure.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.400
It's quite ambitious margins.

33:07.440 --> 33:10.520
I've kept the team
quite tight, um,
based on my assumptions...

33:10.560 --> 33:12.280
At a 45 cover restaurant,

33:12.320 --> 33:14.840
you don't want to have
too many members of staff
behind the counter.

33:14.880 --> 33:18.840
Personally, I think you might
have slightly underestimated
how many team members you need.

33:18.880 --> 33:22.280
Jay's assumptions of what
his staff costs would be
were very low.

33:22.320 --> 33:25.360
From his figures,
I did a quick calculation

33:25.400 --> 33:28.320
and it looked like
he was gonna get
each waiter

33:28.360 --> 33:30.080
to work 11 shifts a week.

33:30.120 --> 33:33.160
And that means that,
basically, no one ever
gets the day off. Ever.

33:38.680 --> 33:42.800
We've two options.
Dynasty as a really special,
one-site restaurant business,

33:42.840 --> 33:45.760
or you're kind of
managing director of
a restaurant roll-out.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.080
What's the dream?

33:47.120 --> 33:50.440
I don't want to build
a huge chain of restaurants

33:50.480 --> 33:51.760
that are the same name.

33:51.800 --> 33:54.920
It's about keeping that
kind of friendly, unique,

33:54.960 --> 33:57.400
local neighborhood
kind of feel to a restaurant.

33:57.440 --> 33:58.320
I like that.

33:59.520 --> 34:03.760
I look at myself as
creating a portfolio

34:03.800 --> 34:07.080
-of really interesting
concepts.
-Okay.

34:07.120 --> 34:10.240
But all around
a similar thread,
a similar theme.

34:10.280 --> 34:14.240
So, it would be
a collection of Asian
bars and restaurants

34:14.280 --> 34:17.040
-as opposed
to Dynasty being...
-[Jay] Yeah.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.760
-...fifteen Dynastys
across the UK.
-Absolutely.

34:19.800 --> 34:23.520
His idea about
creating, effectively,
a hub of Asian restaurants

34:23.560 --> 34:26.440
which he's creating
and curating new concepts

34:26.480 --> 34:27.840
within it,
is an interesting one.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.120
It's not something
we thought about.

34:30.720 --> 34:32.840
[narrator] During the meeting,
Lydia and Darrel

34:32.880 --> 34:35.000
can choose to spell out
the offer they'll make

34:35.040 --> 34:39.080
if, and only if,
they decide to invest tomorrow.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.520
I am looking to bring in
new and exciting concepts

34:41.560 --> 34:43.800
-into some of our luxury,
five-star hotels.
-Sure.

34:43.840 --> 34:50.440
If we brought you in,
I would be looking to invest
about half a million.

34:50.480 --> 34:53.920
The way it would work
is that we would invest
all the money,

34:53.960 --> 34:55.160
we'd do up the space,

34:55.200 --> 34:58.200
you would own your brand
and your concept

34:58.240 --> 35:01.360
-and you would help us
set it up to your spec.
-Okay.

35:01.960 --> 35:04.200
Thank you very much.

35:04.240 --> 35:07.640
Lydia potentially offered
half a million pounds

35:07.680 --> 35:10.640
to open a restaurant
within one of their hotels.

35:10.680 --> 35:12.560
Just amazing.
I'm really chuffed.

35:12.600 --> 35:14.120
-Thank you. Good to see you.
Take care.
-Bye.

35:14.160 --> 35:17.240
[Lydia] Overall,
his model does work.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.800
That leaves me wondering
how he's gonna
perform tomorrow.

35:20.840 --> 35:24.360
How he can deal with service
for a big number of people.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.240
I want to see
what the feedback is
from those guests,

35:26.280 --> 35:29.000
'cause it's one thing
him telling me that last night
went really well,

35:29.040 --> 35:31.600
but it's another thing
to actually see it
with my own eyes.

35:35.080 --> 35:38.800
The biggest question mark is,
how scalable
is the proposition

35:38.840 --> 35:41.120
and getting our heads around
not backing Dynasty,

35:41.160 --> 35:45.720
but effectively backing you
to curate and develop other
Asian cuisine concepts,

35:45.760 --> 35:47.440
which is not something
I really thought about.

35:47.480 --> 35:50.960
For us, it's about
how we're gonna
scale a concept,

35:51.000 --> 35:53.160
a brand in the
bar-restaurant space.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.000
The commercial success
is important,

35:55.040 --> 35:56.320
and there is
an ambition around that.

35:56.360 --> 35:59.200
It's creating
a portfolio of restaurants

35:59.240 --> 36:01.040
that still has
an exit strategy.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.920
With Darrel,
there isn't a clear-cut offer
at this stage,

36:04.960 --> 36:09.880
but what's interesting
is that he's not
closed any doors.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.880
[Darrel]
We're talking about here

36:11.920 --> 36:15.280
potentially investing in one of
the nicest blokes you're ever
likely to meet.

36:15.320 --> 36:18.880
So, would we want
to partner with Jay?
Absolutely.

36:18.920 --> 36:22.840
But the big question for us is,
what are we actually backing?

36:22.880 --> 36:24.800
And I think that needs
a huge amount more thought.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.560
[narrator] Now,
it's Bubble&amp;'s turn.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.960
As David and Atul
are in competition,

36:35.000 --> 36:38.920
Rupert and Marita
now face an hour alone
with each investor.

36:40.080 --> 36:43.400
They're asking for
£140,000.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.320
-Hello.
-Hi, Marita, how are you?

36:46.360 --> 36:48.440
-Good. Good to see you again.
-Good to see you, too.

36:48.480 --> 36:49.360
Hey, Rupert.

36:53.160 --> 36:55.400
Talking about Bubble&amp;...

36:55.440 --> 36:59.360
It's almost like
you haven't said completely
bubble and what?

36:59.400 --> 37:03.000
We couldn't trademark it as
bubble and squeak,
'cause it's a food.

37:03.040 --> 37:06.840
If you can't call it
bubble and squeak,
you've got bubble.

37:06.880 --> 37:10.120
It's very helpful to have
what you serve
above the shop.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.200
The Real Greek
or Pizza Fast.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.960
Bubble &amp;...
What does it mean?

37:15.000 --> 37:17.280
And even if you knew
it meant bubble and squeak,

37:17.320 --> 37:20.040
people of my kids' generation
wouldn't know
what it meant either.

37:20.080 --> 37:24.680
Could an investor
convince you
to change the name if need be?

37:24.720 --> 37:26.800
-For me, yes.
-[Rupert] I think
we're open to it, yeah...

37:26.840 --> 37:29.800
-We're open to it.
-That's good to know.

37:29.840 --> 37:33.680
-I thought your menu pricing
was a bit expensive.
-Okay.

37:33.720 --> 37:38.240
Say you get your price point
even £1.50 or £2.00 too high

37:38.280 --> 37:40.440
in those first four months...

37:40.480 --> 37:42.760
You'll have a lot of
first visitors who'll be
very complimentary

37:42.800 --> 37:44.040
about your food
and they won't come back.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.640
Essentially,
you're looking at
£18 for lunch,

37:48.680 --> 37:51.520
-and £33.60 for dinner.
-Mmm-hmm.

37:51.560 --> 37:54.200
Do you think there's
a potential for people
to pay that sort of money?

37:55.520 --> 37:57.440
Um, yeah, I do. I think so.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.600
[Atul] Doesn't matter
if it's paired with

38:00.640 --> 38:03.120
a salmon or caviar
or lamb fillet for that matter.

38:03.160 --> 38:04.400
It's a humble product.

38:04.440 --> 38:07.120
How you tweak it,
how you wrap it up,

38:07.160 --> 38:08.680
in which wrapper you put it,

38:08.720 --> 38:10.360
it's still going to remain
what it is,

38:10.400 --> 38:14.880
and there has to be
a sensible price for it,
in my opinion.

38:14.920 --> 38:19.200
[narrator] David and Atul can
now choose to outline
their potential offer

38:19.240 --> 38:21.640
or wait until after
tomorrow's service.

38:23.400 --> 38:26.240
My investment reticence
is based on the fact of

38:26.280 --> 38:29.760
will this concept
be acceptable

38:31.000 --> 38:33.200
going forward and opening
a number of stores?

38:33.240 --> 38:35.040
I'm still waiting
to be convinced.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.440
-We'll convince you.
-We'll convince you, yeah.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.640
The whole premise of it
being based around
bubble and squeak

38:40.680 --> 38:42.640
has got...
I've got an issue with.

38:43.880 --> 38:46.160
I've got to obviously
sleep on it.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.600
And then have
another meal tomorrow
and see what happens.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.720
-It's a good concept,
don't get me wrong.
-Okay.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.960
But it's a concept
that needs a little more work.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.720
If we could tweak the price,
if we could tweak the product,

38:57.760 --> 39:01.760
-maybe charge
eight to 12 pounds...
-Yeah, sure.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.200
So you appeal
to larger number of people.

39:04.240 --> 39:10.520
And then that's the concept
which can be taken into
multiple units more easily.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.520
You were looking at
£140,000 investment,

39:12.560 --> 39:14.920
in my opinion,
this investment would be

39:14.960 --> 39:17.760
at least
£200,000-£250,000, no less.

39:17.800 --> 39:20.040
I do want to see
the service tomorrow

39:20.080 --> 39:21.440
and then let's see.
Good luck.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.080
Thank you for your time,
Atul.

39:23.120 --> 39:24.680
-Thanks for sharing all
your thoughts, as well.
-Thank you.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.920
-[Rupert] Appreciate it.
See you again.
-Thank you, Rupert.

39:26.960 --> 39:30.040
In terms of my interest
in this business
at the moment,

39:30.080 --> 39:31.200
I'm around 60-40.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.400
So, 40 I'm not interested.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.080
Uh, I would need to
dig deeper to understand

39:34.120 --> 39:37.240
whether I really can put
all my money into it or not.

39:37.280 --> 39:41.080
I think he could get
a sense very quickly
that we are open to change,

39:41.120 --> 39:42.640
so change in name...

39:42.680 --> 39:44.360
-Positives that have
come out of it.
-Changes in menu...

39:44.400 --> 39:46.160
That's business.

39:46.200 --> 39:50.240
Tomorrow, the service...
Hopefully we can do
ourselves justice and, um,

39:50.280 --> 39:51.560
we'll see
how people are enjoying

39:51.600 --> 39:53.200
all the different flavors
of the bubble and squeak.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.040
[Fred] Both restaurants
came to Manchester

40:06.080 --> 40:09.320
determined to get
the investment that would
put them on the high street.

40:09.360 --> 40:12.000
But both face serious issues.

40:12.040 --> 40:16.560
[narrator] Today, Jay and
Marita and Rupert open
one final time.

40:16.600 --> 40:20.920
The investors want to see
the restaurants cope
with a full service,

40:20.960 --> 40:25.480
and discover
the public's appetite for these
two brand new ideas.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.680
It's the very last chance
to prove they're
worth the money

40:28.720 --> 40:31.240
they're asking for.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.960
[Jay] Today, it feels
much more like we're running
a proper restaurant.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.760
And we're really out
to kind of impress everyone
that walks through the door.

40:37.800 --> 40:40.520
It really is important
that we try and get

40:40.560 --> 40:42.320
two offers on the table.

40:42.360 --> 40:45.360
Hopefully, any kind of
questions Darrel had
I answered them last night

40:45.400 --> 40:46.800
as best as I could.

40:46.840 --> 40:49.520
And, um, today,
hopefully we can just
win him over

40:49.560 --> 40:51.880
with the service and
the experience that he's gonna
have in the restaurant.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.880
[Rupert] They were
concerned about the price

40:57.920 --> 41:00.040
so I thought,
"Well, let's just show
some flexibility.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.400
"Okay, we've taken that
on board."

41:02.440 --> 41:03.960
I'm gonna take a pound
of everything.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.600
It might not be enough
for what they want to see,

41:06.640 --> 41:08.520
but at least it shows that
we're thinking about it

41:08.560 --> 41:10.240
and we've taken on board
what they've said.

41:22.720 --> 41:24.720
[narrator] But an hour
before service,

41:24.760 --> 41:27.720
one investor is having
second thoughts.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.400
-Morning, Darrel.
-Good morning, Fred.

41:31.440 --> 41:32.960
-How are you? You okay?
-I'm very well.
How are you?

41:33.000 --> 41:34.480
Good to see you.
Yeah, very well, thank you.

41:34.520 --> 41:36.120
So what's the story today?
What's going on?

41:36.160 --> 41:39.680
On a standalone basis,
Dynasty is absolutely
worth investment,

41:39.720 --> 41:43.000
but from an Imbiba perspective,
it's just a challenge,

41:43.040 --> 41:45.200
because we, what we do,
our whole business model is

41:45.240 --> 41:48.840
multiple bars and restaurants
rather than single site.

41:48.880 --> 41:52.480
And I tried to convince myself
that we could somehow
make it work,

41:52.520 --> 41:54.400
we could somehow
find a way,

41:54.440 --> 41:57.480
but actually,
it's not what we do.

41:57.520 --> 42:00.880
It would be disingenuous
for me to turn up today
at lunch

42:00.920 --> 42:02.360
and go through the motions

42:02.400 --> 42:05.440
when I just know
it's not the Imbiba
business model.

42:05.480 --> 42:07.880
It's just not worth
the investment for Imbiba.

42:07.920 --> 42:09.600
Can't reiterate enough.

42:09.640 --> 42:11.720
He's a special character
and he's got a huge future
in this industry.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.240
[Jay] Twenty minutes.
Can we do everything
in 20 minutes?

42:18.280 --> 42:20.800
-Have we got...
Left outstanding?
-[woman] Yes, we can.

42:21.480 --> 42:23.360
Yeah? No?

42:23.400 --> 42:25.440
Everything in...
Everything in 20 minutes.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.720
[greeting in Korean]

42:29.760 --> 42:31.680
-[greeting in Korean]
-How are you? You all right?

42:31.720 --> 42:33.680
-How are you?
-Nice to see you again.

42:33.720 --> 42:35.560
-I've got a bit of
bad news for you.
-Okay.

42:35.600 --> 42:38.360
Darrel Connell from Imbiba
has decided to pull out.

42:38.400 --> 42:42.320
Mmm, yeah. Okay.
That's a shame.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.640
Your restaurant is not
quite the fit for him.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.080
Fair enough.

42:48.120 --> 42:51.960
But Lydia Forte,
she can't wait to see
your place in action today

42:52.000 --> 42:53.840
after that fantastic
lunch yesterday.

42:53.880 --> 42:58.200
We're now just gonna be
focused on getting Lydia
to have a great time here.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.480
-You've got everything
to win here.
-Yeah.

43:00.520 --> 43:02.720
-So...
-Yeah, onwards and upwards.

43:02.760 --> 43:05.880
-Good luck, Jay.
See you later.
-See you later.

43:05.920 --> 43:08.080
I guess I'm really
disappointed by that.

43:08.120 --> 43:10.440
Personally,
I would have
liked him to come today

43:10.480 --> 43:13.680
and gone through
the experience with customers.

43:13.720 --> 43:17.240
It is what it is
and, you know,
you can't control that.

43:17.280 --> 43:22.080
Lydia's coming in,
and we're just gonna give her
a great experience.

43:26.560 --> 43:30.880
[narrator] At Bubble&amp;,
Rupert and Marita also have
a lot to prove.

43:30.920 --> 43:33.320
Right now I'm feeling
nervous, you know.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.960
We've got to deliver
again today.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.160
[narrator]
With no clear offer
on the table,

43:39.200 --> 43:42.040
it's their last chance
to impress.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.800
Hello.
Welcome to Bubble&amp;.

43:44.840 --> 43:48.360
[Atul] I know that,
for Rupert and Marita,
it's a big day.

43:48.400 --> 43:50.040
While I'm a little forgiving,

43:50.080 --> 43:52.760
I'm also observing
whether people like it
or they don't like it.

43:52.800 --> 43:55.040
I want to see the energy
between the two.

43:55.080 --> 43:56.960
If they're husband and wife
then, you know,

43:57.000 --> 44:00.040
sometimes it's a great formula,
sometimes it's a recipe
for disaster.

44:00.080 --> 44:02.720
[David] Bubble and squeak...
I just can't get
my head around

44:02.760 --> 44:04.320
a restaurant business
based on it.

44:04.360 --> 44:06.440
However, I'm going back
to have some more food

44:06.480 --> 44:08.360
and looking forward
to see how they work,

44:08.400 --> 44:10.520
see how the customers react.

44:10.560 --> 44:12.280
They may change my mind.

44:16.040 --> 44:18.600
How are we doing?
Thank you for coming again.
Hello, Atul.

44:18.640 --> 44:19.880
Hi, Marita, how are you?

44:22.480 --> 44:24.280
So, gentleman,
I just wanted to point out

44:24.320 --> 44:26.880
just a couple of
things we've done
differently today.

44:26.920 --> 44:29.320
-You'll notice that some of
the prices have changed.
-Oh, yeah.

44:29.360 --> 44:31.520
[bell dings]

44:31.560 --> 44:33.640
-Well, that's good.
-Yeah, yeah.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.160
And they've changed this.
Redefining bubble and squeak.

44:36.200 --> 44:38.440
-I like that.
-Yeah, very good.

44:38.480 --> 44:40.720
And this actually explains
what they're doing.

44:40.760 --> 44:42.120
I like that.

44:42.160 --> 44:44.920
It's a new concept
and never been done before,

44:44.960 --> 44:49.280
so you have to prepared
to change your track
all the time

44:49.320 --> 44:50.440
till you become successful.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.720
That's the mantra
to be followed.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.600
So, they're already flexible,
which is good.

44:54.640 --> 44:57.840
Take this is table seven.
Then you got halloumi,
two goat's cheese to come.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.400
[woman] I think it's good
because you can come here

45:03.440 --> 45:07.040
and someone can have brunch,
but someone can have lunch
at the same time.

45:09.680 --> 45:12.880
[Rupert] Investors.
Classic halloumi and a lamb.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.880
They want to test
that lamb again.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.480
Their taste buds might be
a bit different today.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.200
[Lydia] Today,
I'm very interested to see

45:24.240 --> 45:26.000
that the public
isn't too shocked

45:26.040 --> 45:27.800
by what
they're being presented.

45:27.840 --> 45:30.040
People are willing
to try something new,

45:30.080 --> 45:33.920
but the flavors have to be
somewhat approachable.

45:33.960 --> 45:35.680
Can it tick all the boxes?

45:35.720 --> 45:36.680
Let's see.

45:38.320 --> 45:41.200
[all greeting in Korean]

45:41.240 --> 45:42.680
[Jay] Hey, do you mind
sitting at the bar?

45:42.720 --> 45:44.920
-No, I'm really happy
sitting there.
-Great. Thank you.

45:44.960 --> 45:48.240
[Rebecca]
Would you like a drink?
Maybe some sparkling water?

45:48.280 --> 45:52.240
-I'll try one of your
Bocha teas.
-[Rebecca] Yes, of course.

45:52.280 --> 45:54.680
-And a still water, please,
as well.
-And a still water.

45:58.280 --> 46:00.080
[man] Check on, Chef.

46:00.120 --> 46:02.600
Two bibimbap, one aubergine,
one pumpkin.

46:02.640 --> 46:05.600
[Lydia] I want to see
a convivial atmosphere,

46:05.640 --> 46:06.960
I want to see
the sharing plates,

46:07.000 --> 46:08.640
I want to see
people passing
each other food,

46:08.680 --> 46:10.440
talking about the food.

46:10.480 --> 46:12.480
I'm basically hoping that
the guests are going to enjoy
the experience.

46:15.160 --> 46:18.440
[narrator] At Bubble&amp;,
the mains are served.

46:18.480 --> 46:22.080
First, the lamb
that failed to convince
yesterday...

46:26.000 --> 46:28.920
The taste is same
like yesterday.

46:28.960 --> 46:30.280
Oh, really?

46:32.480 --> 46:34.680
So he obviously needs
some help from you, possibly.

46:38.120 --> 46:41.120
[narrator]
Next, the bubble and classic.

46:41.160 --> 46:42.560
This is a classic
for a reason, huh?

46:42.600 --> 46:44.240
[David] As good as yesterday.
[Atul] Yeah.

46:53.120 --> 46:57.120
My food is every bit
as delicious as yesterday.

46:57.160 --> 46:59.400
Can I get a seaweed...
Seaweed flat bread, please?

46:59.440 --> 47:00.640
The atmosphere is good,

47:00.680 --> 47:04.240
people seem to be
intrigued by the menu,

47:04.280 --> 47:06.800
by the food.

47:06.840 --> 47:09.160
[Jay] Order up, please.
Service.

47:09.200 --> 47:10.720
Food's going out much quicker.

47:10.760 --> 47:13.600
Uh, we've got a system
and it's good.

47:13.640 --> 47:16.000
-[Lydia] Hi, guys. Do you mind
if I catch you on your way out?
-Not at all.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.880
How was your experience today?
Did you have a nice meal?

47:17.920 --> 47:20.280
It was great.
It's not something that
I normally would've chosen,

47:20.320 --> 47:22.640
but as something different
it was really nice.

47:22.680 --> 47:23.960
So why did you choose it?

47:24.000 --> 47:26.440
Korean food's not huge
at the moment in Manchester,

47:26.480 --> 47:29.160
but definitely
very interesting.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.080
Lovely balance
of different flavors.

47:31.120 --> 47:33.640
It's all vegan as well,
did you realize?

47:33.680 --> 47:35.920
You feel good eating it.
I'd totally try it again,
wouldn't we?

47:35.960 --> 47:37.560
-Definitely try it again.
Yeah.
-It was nice.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.960
Well, I'm really glad
you enjoyed it.
That's good to hear.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.440
[man] Food was fantastic.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.840
Not the sort of things
I would normally typically pick
from the menu,

47:46.880 --> 47:49.640
but amazingly tasty
when we had them

47:49.680 --> 47:51.760
and really well delivered.
It was great, yeah. Fantastic.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.520
Great. So, if this were
here permanently,

47:53.560 --> 47:55.040
is this something
that you would come back to?

47:55.080 --> 47:56.200
Yeah, definitely.

47:59.880 --> 48:01.720
[Atul] How are you doing?
[woman] Good. How are you?

48:01.760 --> 48:03.120
[Atul] How's the meal been
so far for you?

48:03.160 --> 48:05.320
-Oh, it's been lovely.
Really nice.
-Oh, good.

48:05.360 --> 48:07.040
Yeah, like, it's so simple,

48:07.080 --> 48:08.640
but, like,
there's just so much flavor.

48:08.680 --> 48:11.040
-And what did you eat?
-Bubble and lamb
on the recommendation.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.080
-Okay.
-Yeah.

48:12.120 --> 48:13.800
-You liked it?
-Oh, loved it.

48:13.840 --> 48:15.600
-It's really, really nice.
-[Atul] Was the portion
too big, or...

48:15.640 --> 48:17.760
No, it was good portion-size,
I thought.

48:17.800 --> 48:19.880
-Would you order that again?
-[woman] Yeah.

48:19.920 --> 48:21.520
Cool. Cool.

48:21.560 --> 48:23.680
[Atul] A concept
like bubble and squeak.
Do you think that works?

48:23.720 --> 48:27.360
I wouldn't purposely come out
for a meal in the evening,
maybe, for something like that,

48:27.400 --> 48:30.760
but for a daytime treat...
The fillings were good.

48:30.800 --> 48:32.760
I always like to think that
if my restaurant can

48:32.800 --> 48:34.800
always make money
on every mealtime,

48:34.840 --> 48:37.720
breakfast, lunch, dinner.
That's the best scenario,
to be honest.

48:37.760 --> 48:41.080
It's an important question,
and how I take it
and how far I take it...

48:41.120 --> 48:44.320
I really need to put
my mind together on it
and do some numbers, too.

48:44.360 --> 48:47.280
[David] They seem to be
very adaptable,
very keen to learn.

48:47.320 --> 48:49.640
They quickly redid the menu,
redefining bubble and squeak.

48:49.680 --> 48:52.280
They've got it in there,
what they're serving.
It's called Bubble&amp;.

48:52.320 --> 48:55.040
It's absolutely brilliant.
She's obviously
pretty good at marketing.

48:55.080 --> 48:56.240
She knows her stuff.

48:56.280 --> 48:57.640
She's got a lot of experience.

48:57.680 --> 48:59.240
And combined with his cooking,
they're a great team.

49:02.840 --> 49:04.360
[Rupert]
Did they say anything?

49:04.400 --> 49:06.560
You know, they had some
really constructive
things to say.

49:06.600 --> 49:07.920
-Oh, okay.
-Really constructive.

49:07.960 --> 49:08.960
Oh, okay. Cool.

49:11.880 --> 49:13.360
[greeting in Korean]

49:13.400 --> 49:14.600
[Lydia] Thank you. Bye, Jay.

49:17.480 --> 49:19.840
That was a really great lunch,

49:19.880 --> 49:24.920
and it's confirmed to me
that the concept is attractive

49:24.960 --> 49:27.280
and that Jay can perform.

49:27.320 --> 49:30.080
But he's given me
a lot to think about.

49:30.120 --> 49:34.240
Is a luxury, five-star hotel
the right location
for Jay's concept?

49:34.280 --> 49:35.360
I'm not sure.

49:35.400 --> 49:36.320
Well done.

49:37.760 --> 49:38.800
Well done.

49:40.040 --> 49:41.720
[Jay] So if I had to sum up
today's lunch,

49:41.760 --> 49:43.880
it felt like Dynasty
was really alive.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.240
[exhales]

49:52.240 --> 49:53.200
[sniffles]

49:57.240 --> 49:58.360
[exhales]

49:59.640 --> 50:00.680
Feels really good.

50:06.160 --> 50:07.440
[sighs]
Better get back to work.

50:15.040 --> 50:16.480
[narrator] Lunch is over.

50:16.520 --> 50:19.160
Now the pressure
is on the investors.

50:19.200 --> 50:23.800
They have to decide
whether the idea is worth
their money.

50:23.840 --> 50:25.880
[Fred] How are you guys?
[Rupert] Hi, Fred,
you all right?

50:25.920 --> 50:28.400
-How was it today?
-Good service.

50:28.440 --> 50:32.480
Well, the investors
now have a deadline,

50:32.520 --> 50:35.440
and they have one hour
to come back, on the clock,

50:35.480 --> 50:36.760
and make you an offer.

50:36.800 --> 50:39.400
So if they walk
through the door,
game is on.

50:39.440 --> 50:40.720
If they don't then
it's game over.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.440
-All right? Good luck.
-Thank you.

50:43.480 --> 50:44.760
Cheers, Fred.
Thanks a lot.

50:50.480 --> 50:55.200
[narrator]
Bubble&amp; came here
looking for £140,000.

50:55.240 --> 50:57.960
The deadline is 6:30 p.m.

50:58.000 --> 51:02.880
David and Atul could both
walk through the door
and make competing offers,

51:02.920 --> 51:07.080
or Rupert and Marita
could walk away with nothing.

51:14.800 --> 51:19.080
We were talking earlier about,
was there anything
we could've done different?

51:19.120 --> 51:21.240
And this is just, you know,
this is who we are.

51:21.280 --> 51:23.200
-This is...
-Yeah.

51:23.240 --> 51:25.320
-It's our brand and what we do.
-That's what we do.

51:25.360 --> 51:28.560
And if, you know,
they're not the
right investors,

51:28.600 --> 51:31.120
then so be it.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.320
We have to find a way
doing it on our own, or...

51:33.360 --> 51:35.440
Maybe there's another
investor out there.

51:51.720 --> 51:52.760
One minute to go.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.280
[Marita groans]

52:12.280 --> 52:14.800
Marita, Rupert,
your time is up.

52:14.840 --> 52:15.840
Okay.

52:16.480 --> 52:17.640
I'm sorry.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.080
-It's okay.
-Oh...

52:19.840 --> 52:21.160
It wasn't meant to be.

52:22.840 --> 52:25.480
[David] I'm not
gonna invest in
Bubble&amp; because

52:25.520 --> 52:27.680
it's not ready yet
for the high street.

52:28.560 --> 52:30.440
The menu needed fixing.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.640
Price, portions, ingredients.

52:32.680 --> 52:35.280
That's quite a lot to fix.

52:35.320 --> 52:38.320
You shouldn't go posh
with bubble and squeak,

52:38.360 --> 52:39.640
like you shouldn't
go posh with pizza.

52:41.600 --> 52:43.880
[Fred] You know what?
Your kids are gonna be
so proud of you.

52:43.920 --> 52:45.960
-You've given it your all.
-[Marita] Mmm-hmm.

52:46.000 --> 52:49.960
You proved them, you know,
what you can do
and what you're about.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.680
We don't feel
we let ourselves down, did we?

52:51.720 --> 52:52.960
No. No, no.

52:55.120 --> 52:57.960
[narrator] But there's still
an opportunity
for Rupert and Marita.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.600
-Atul.
-Can I join you?

53:00.640 --> 53:02.640
Of course.
Come take a seat.

53:02.680 --> 53:04.840
[narrator]
The investor deadline
may have passed,

53:04.880 --> 53:07.480
but Atul has decided
to make a late entrance.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.040
Thanks for coming back.
Cheers, Atul.

53:09.080 --> 53:11.600
Guys, I don't have
an offer for you,
but I have a proposal.

53:11.640 --> 53:13.720
Oh.

53:13.760 --> 53:15.960
-Provided you're willing
to listen to me.
-Of course.

53:16.600 --> 53:18.040
Absolutely!

53:18.080 --> 53:22.480
I just feel that the project,
at this stage, is not ready.

53:22.520 --> 53:26.720
It's not a concept that we can
put in the restaurant yet.

53:26.760 --> 53:28.120
[Rupert] Mmm-hmm.

53:28.160 --> 53:32.520
However, it'll be a shame
if I didn't come out to help.

53:32.560 --> 53:33.880
[Rupert] Mmm-hmm.

53:33.920 --> 53:37.720
According to me,
it'll take good
six to nine months

53:37.760 --> 53:41.920
to work together
and develop the concept.

53:43.160 --> 53:45.400
And by the end of it,
if the project is ready,

53:45.440 --> 53:47.600
if you feel that it's good
and I feel it's good,

53:47.640 --> 53:50.400
and my team has got
confidence in it,

53:50.440 --> 53:53.200
then we can go and talk about
investing money with you,

53:53.240 --> 53:56.840
and I think
it'll cost us about
£150,000 to £200,000.

53:56.880 --> 54:00.560
And if it's acceptable,
then let's shake hands
and move on.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.440
-It's a generous proposal.
-Yes.

54:04.480 --> 54:06.080
And also that
we get to work with you

54:06.120 --> 54:09.280
and you get to develop our food
with us, together.

54:09.320 --> 54:10.600
Maybe nine months
down the line

54:10.640 --> 54:12.280
I'll have a massive smile
on my face

54:12.320 --> 54:13.600
and we would be
planning not one,

54:13.640 --> 54:16.160
maybe two, three
restaurants.

54:16.200 --> 54:18.560
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you, Atul.
It means a lot.

54:18.600 --> 54:20.560
-I think it's a great thing
you've offered us.
-Oh, thank you.

54:20.600 --> 54:22.520
That's very, uh...
Very generous of you.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.880
I'm very happy
to be part of your project,

54:25.920 --> 54:28.120
and I hope you feel likewise.

54:28.520 --> 54:30.000
Thank you.

54:30.040 --> 54:32.000
-What a gift.
-Oh!

54:32.040 --> 54:33.800
That is the best outcome ever.

54:33.840 --> 54:35.640
Cheers, guys.

54:35.680 --> 54:37.160
See you later. Come on.
Give me a hug.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.080
[Rupert]
We can learn off that, so, um,

54:39.120 --> 54:42.480
you know, it's not gonna be
plain sailing...
Everything's... You know,

54:42.520 --> 54:44.840
gold dust, there's gonna be
ups and downs still, but...

54:46.000 --> 54:47.680
Oh, wow.
I'm at peace now.

54:54.760 --> 54:56.720
[narrator]
Now it's Jay's turn to wait.

54:57.920 --> 54:59.760
Darrel has pulled out.

54:59.800 --> 55:03.120
Jay's only hope of investment
rests with Lydia.

55:03.160 --> 55:06.280
She has until 8:00 p.m.
to make an offer.

55:09.360 --> 55:10.520
What are you thinking?

55:11.480 --> 55:12.720
Um... [clears throat]

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
What drink
I'm gonna have at the bar.

55:16.040 --> 55:17.360
[chuckles]

55:17.400 --> 55:20.000
What are you gonna have?

55:20.040 --> 55:22.200
Well, it's either gonna be
beer or champagne,
isn't it?

55:22.240 --> 55:23.640
[chuckles]

55:26.880 --> 55:29.440
-[Fred]
Whether you get it or not...
-Mmm.

55:29.480 --> 55:32.600
No one will ever forget
what you did in here
for the last three days.

55:33.840 --> 55:36.040
Your passion, your ethos,

55:36.560 --> 55:37.600
your food.

55:37.640 --> 55:39.120
It's amazing
what you've done here.

55:39.160 --> 55:40.080
Thank you.

55:46.280 --> 55:48.440
Trying to vision.

55:48.480 --> 55:50.840
Good vision, good thoughts.

55:52.640 --> 55:55.520
If you start to vision what
something would look like,
then you kind of,

55:56.480 --> 55:59.920
you know,
helps the mind focus.

56:07.680 --> 56:09.040
Three minutes.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.200
-[Lydia] Hi, Jay
-[laughs]

56:39.640 --> 56:41.280
-Lydia.
-Hi.

56:41.320 --> 56:42.680
Hello.

56:42.720 --> 56:45.520
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

56:45.560 --> 56:47.600
Hi. How you doing?

56:47.640 --> 56:49.280
Very glad to see you.

56:49.320 --> 56:50.560
Well, I'm happy to see you.

56:50.600 --> 56:52.720
-Um...
-[Fred] Take a seat.

56:52.760 --> 56:53.880
So, Lydia.

56:53.920 --> 56:56.040
I absolutely love the concept,

56:56.080 --> 56:58.920
-and I absolutely think
the food is delicious...
-Thank you.

56:58.960 --> 57:01.200
-And I think
you're brilliant, so...
-Thank you.

57:01.240 --> 57:04.680
-I'm really happy.
-What is your offer?
What is your vision?

57:04.720 --> 57:07.440
Rocco Forte hotels would like
to bring you to Berlin,

57:07.480 --> 57:11.440
um, to our luxury,
five-star Hotel de Rome.

57:11.480 --> 57:14.800
We'd like to set you up
in a residency

57:14.840 --> 57:17.440
so that we can get you
cooking straightaway.

57:17.480 --> 57:19.640
And if that all
goes to plan,

57:19.680 --> 57:24.400
we can find you
a more permanent site
within the group,

57:24.440 --> 57:26.040
specced out
to your heart's content.

57:26.080 --> 57:28.120
And if we do that
it would be about
a half a million investment.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.360
[laughs]

57:32.400 --> 57:34.240
Let's just do the maths
for this one.

57:35.680 --> 57:40.840
Three days ago, set up
a pop-up restaurant concept,

57:40.880 --> 57:43.320
something that I've been
working on for
a couple of years.

57:44.760 --> 57:47.600
Today, I'm walking away
with a restaurant

57:48.800 --> 57:50.560
in a luxury hotel group

57:51.520 --> 57:54.640
in Europe, in Berlin,

57:54.680 --> 57:56.640
with potentially
half a million on the table.

57:58.520 --> 58:00.600
I mean, yeah.

58:02.440 --> 58:07.160
That's brilliant!
Feeling number one
at the moment.

58:07.200 --> 58:10.880
-Open that champagne.
-[all laughing]

58:10.920 --> 58:13.680
[Lydia]
We have, right now,
chefs with a total

58:13.720 --> 58:15.920
of nine Michelin Stars
in our hotels,

58:15.960 --> 58:19.440
so I'm really excited
to bring him into that crowd.

58:19.480 --> 58:21.480
I think he deserves it.

58:21.520 --> 58:25.800
I think our hotel guests,
but also Berlin,
are gonna really love it

58:25.840 --> 58:28.560
and I'm excited
to offer that to them.

58:28.600 --> 58:31.520
-[Fred] Can I propose a toast?
-Absolutely. Please do.

58:31.560 --> 58:34.160
-Well done. To Dynasty.
-To Dynasty.

58:34.200 --> 58:35.640
To Dynasty.

58:39.240 --> 58:42.840
Hold on. What you're saying is
very well-established brands...

58:42.880 --> 58:44.360
You just said they're average.

58:44.400 --> 58:46.280
Our burger is better
than what is out there
at the moment.

58:46.320 --> 58:49.440
Big statement.
Got to back it up now.

58:50.480 --> 58:52.520
This is a problem.

58:53.800 --> 58:55.800
We've hardly made a dent
into any of them.

58:55.840 --> 58:57.720
Is that not a worry?

58:57.760 --> 58:59.760
[theme music playing]
