01:14.074 --> 01:16.076
Hello.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.912
I have an
international transaction.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.623
This is my paperwork.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.545
<i>dramatic music</i>

02:30.900 --> 02:32.861
Welcome to Chicago, Mr. Horne.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.280
Where am I taking you today?

02:53.464 --> 02:56.050
Thank you
all for being here today

02:56.050 --> 02:59.596
on the ten-year anniversary of
the passing of Merritt King.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.181
Merritt King was the epitome

03:01.181 --> 03:03.975
of Black excellence
in our community.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.059
He formed coalitions,

03:05.059 --> 03:07.187
registered voters,
sought alliances,

03:07.187 --> 03:08.897
and encouraged
the Black community

03:08.897 --> 03:11.858
to always recognize
that our collective voice

03:11.858 --> 03:14.569
is more powerful
than any one of us.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.488
Merritt King worked
outside the system

03:17.488 --> 03:18.948
in order to change the system.

03:18.948 --> 03:21.576
We are very proud
of all that he accomplished.

03:22.911 --> 03:26.039
So let us light a candle
as we leave

03:26.039 --> 03:27.081
and pray for his soul

03:27.081 --> 03:29.918
and for all the souls
he left behind.

03:31.461 --> 03:32.420
Let us pray.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.969
What up, Uncle Jeremy?

03:41.012 --> 03:42.305
I did not expect
to see you here.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.723
Well, he was my brother.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.060
Just because we weren't close
doesn't mean I don't miss him.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.561
My dad used to tell me,

03:48.561 --> 03:50.063
"Whatever you do,

03:50.063 --> 03:52.649
stay away from your
Uncle Jeremy."

03:52.649 --> 03:54.025
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:55.193 --> 03:58.404
Well, it's, uh, been
good seeing you, Marshall.

03:59.572 --> 04:02.033
Yo, Unc! Yo, that's it?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.369
That's the extent
of our relationship.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.121
You just said you were told
to stay away from me.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.289
Hey, hey, look,

04:08.289 --> 04:10.625
what my dad said
about you was wack.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.418
Look, I'm just happy to see you.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.171
And, uh,
I was wondering, actually...

04:15.171 --> 04:17.799
What's going on, Marshall?

04:21.386 --> 04:23.096
Look, I'm-- I'm in trouble.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.764
I owe money-- A lot.

04:24.764 --> 04:27.308
I'm trying to get, like, like,
a bank loan or something

04:27.308 --> 04:29.352
to keep these folks
up off of me, man.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.687
But-- But it's serious.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.189
I even got friends
that work at First Chicago,

04:33.189 --> 04:36.067
but I don't know the first steps
to getting a bank loan, Unc.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.568
What do your friends do
at First Chicago?

04:37.568 --> 04:39.279
All I know is that
they deal with money.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.365
But, I mean, you've dealt
with banks and finance, right?

04:42.365 --> 04:43.366
Hm.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.742
They're coming by the studio.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.369
You could meet them tonight.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.370
Your friends?

04:47.370 --> 04:50.540
I got a whole career going on,
Uncle Jeremy.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.667
But I-I need your help.

Oh, man, you made it.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.550
Oh. Yes, sir.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.511
There's a diner
around the corner.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.346
Why don't you finish up here,

06:28.346 --> 06:30.181
and let's go down and talk
about your situation.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.474
Okay. Cool, cool. Hey. Hey.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.185
Tell Rick, Danny, and LaDonna to
meet us at the diner, alright?

06:34.185 --> 06:37.063
Cool. Come on.

06:38.106 --> 06:41.651
Explain to me
this house music empire.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.486
What's... What's your vision?

06:43.486 --> 06:45.238
House is dominating
the charts, Unc.

06:47.865 --> 06:50.410
<i>Disco, dance, R&B.</i>

06:50.410 --> 06:53.454
It's cool. But house?

06:54.539 --> 06:57.417
<i>House music is pure Chicago.</i>

06:57.417 --> 06:58.459
And it's right now.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.628
It is blowing up in Detroit,

07:00.628 --> 07:02.380
New York, Paris.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.715
<i>I mean, in Manchester, England,</i>

07:04.715 --> 07:07.969
<i>there's a club playing
our mixes, our tracks.</i>

07:08.428 --> 07:10.972
I just got to build
a recording facility,

07:10.972 --> 07:13.224
along with distribution
and manufacturing.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.600
I mean, if I can do that,

07:14.600 --> 07:16.811
I could be the Berry Gordy
of house music.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.479
Just need the money to prove it.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.315
So, Unc, I got mixed up with
loan sharks, man.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.650
They won't back off.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.236
Look, I'm trying to build
an empire, okay?

07:25.236 --> 07:29.031
So you owe them, uh, $10,000?

07:29.031 --> 07:30.533
Couldn't get the money
anywhere else.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.077
<i>I didn't know any Black folks
investing in house music.</i>

07:33.077 --> 07:35.872
<i>So until I pay them back,
they gonna keep coming at me.</i>

07:37.748 --> 07:39.917
We want our money!

07:40.668 --> 07:42.295
No, I just-- I just--

07:42.295 --> 07:44.547
I just need to get
these guys their money.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.259
Uh...

07:48.259 --> 07:51.721
...so, uh, this is Danny,
LaDonna, and Rick.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.514
They all work
at the First Chicago.

07:53.514 --> 07:56.767
- This is my uncle, Jeremy Horne.
- Pleasure.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.520
Pleasure. Pleasure.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.105
Come on in.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.028
Mr. Marshall is interested
in a bank loan.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.156
I take it you all are
junior loan officers

08:10.156 --> 08:12.033
over at First Chicago.

08:14.535 --> 08:18.039
He-- He said you all
work with money.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.710
I work in the wire transfer department.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.378
Uh, check clearing.

08:24.378 --> 08:27.215
Me and Rick work
the same night shift.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.799
And we move millions.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.221
Very impressive.

08:33.221 --> 08:37.600
Would you all be interested
in dinner to discuss further?

08:39.352 --> 08:40.561
On me, of course.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.688
-  Yeah.
- Sure. Yeah.

08:44.857 --> 08:45.816
You all are aware

08:45.816 --> 08:48.236
what a powerful position
you're in,

08:48.236 --> 08:49.570
working at
one of the largest banks

08:49.570 --> 08:51.447
- in the country.
- Yes, sir.

08:51.447 --> 08:53.783
And as you know,
many corporations

08:53.783 --> 08:56.619
move a lot of their money
through your bank.

08:56.619 --> 09:00.831
Chicago is the banking hub
of the country.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.833
- And at the Board of Trade
- Uh-huh.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.460
- down on LaSalle Street,
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.921
it's probably more important
than Wall Street.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.464
I want to be a stockbroker

09:08.464 --> 09:10.341
on the floor
of the Board of Trade.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.842
That's my dream.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.886
LaDonna, Danny, you-- you--

09:13.886 --> 09:15.763
you have any ambitions
at the bank?

09:15.763 --> 09:18.641
I think I'd like to work
on the retail side.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.685
You know, I'm good with people.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.687
Yeah. I can see that.

09:22.687 --> 09:23.854
Uh, I'm not.

09:24.855 --> 09:27.733
I like systems, how things work.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.277
Yeah, he's good at that.

09:29.277 --> 09:33.322
Mm. What do you all make?
Minimum wage?

09:33.322 --> 09:36.534
What-- What is it? $3, $3.30?

09:36.534 --> 09:38.661
$3.35.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.413
So, yeah.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.248
What about that bank loan?

09:42.248 --> 09:43.874
Let's, uh--
Let's talk about that.

09:43.874 --> 09:46.377
Ha-- Have-- Have any of you
ever thought about

09:46.377 --> 09:48.462
how much money goes
directly through you all?

09:48.462 --> 09:52.383
Mm, seven billion-one hundred
and twenty-nine-thousand.

09:52.383 --> 09:54.719
Of course you know
the exact amount.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.971
We all do,
'cause it's not our money.

09:57.346 --> 09:59.765
But I have a good time
counting it.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.602
Oh. And the transfer calls,

10:02.602 --> 10:04.270
you cannot make a mistake.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.563
-  Oh. Mnh-mnh.
-  No, no, no.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.231
- Or else you're gone.
-  Mm-hmm.

10:07.231 --> 10:10.860
Have you all ever heard of
Ivan Boesky or Michael Milken?

10:10.860 --> 10:13.112
Very prominent
in the financial world.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.405
Little greedy.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.782
Hey, let's just say

10:16.782 --> 10:19.952
there's a lot of
opportunities at a bank

10:19.952 --> 10:21.621
for forward-thinking,

10:21.621 --> 10:24.999
ambitious people
like yourselves.

10:32.506 --> 10:35.760
Well... thank you
so much for the meal.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.346
Oh. Okay. Of course.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.514
And it's really nice
meeting you.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.432
Mm-hmm.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.101
And so
we'll see you later, Marshall.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.979
Thank you guys.

10:51.859 --> 10:55.237
You know, can we talk
about the bank loan, Unc?

10:55.237 --> 10:56.489
I need that money.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.783
They can't help you
with a bank loan,

10:58.783 --> 11:00.201
but I can.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.912
Here's $10,000.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.373
And now you're in control.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.001
And now you work for me.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.593
- Damn!
- Mm-hmm.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.511
Thanks, Unc.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.888
Don't you have to DJ tonight?

11:20.888 --> 11:23.099
Oh, shit. Uh...

11:23.099 --> 11:24.767
- Hey, Unc, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.603
- Thank you.
- And, by the way,

11:27.603 --> 11:29.480
what are your
friends' names again?

11:29.480 --> 11:30.856
Yo, who was that guy?

11:30.856 --> 11:33.275
Mr. Horne asked
a lot of questions.

11:33.275 --> 11:36.821
I found it
a very stimulating conversation.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.989
Did you notice
Mr. Horne's watch?

11:38.989 --> 11:41.450
A stone-cold Rolex!

11:41.450 --> 11:43.119
- Yeah.
- Damn.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.371
What's a Rolex?

11:45.371 --> 11:49.542
LaDonna, a Rolex is a watch
worn by men with money.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.586
Aren't you looking
for somebody like that?

11:52.586 --> 11:57.425
<i>woman vocalizing</i>

12:01.887 --> 12:06.684
<i>Put 40 hours in

<i>Friday's here

<i>You played some dice...</i>

12:11.647 --> 12:13.774
<i>And we are opening up

12:18.404 --> 12:20.448
<i>The rumors have some validity.</i>

12:20.448 --> 12:22.950
Did the power establishment

12:22.950 --> 12:24.827
have the mayor taken out?

12:24.827 --> 12:27.621
We're taking callers

12:37.339 --> 12:41.969

-  Look at her.

Now how y'all gonna do homework
and watch TV at the same time?

12:54.023 --> 12:56.358
Come on. We do it all the time.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.194
Mm-hmm.

12:59.361 --> 13:00.905
Let me see.

13:01.739 --> 13:05.075
And that's why you
need to correct this,

13:05.075 --> 13:06.118
this,

13:06.118 --> 13:07.077
and this.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.079
But, LaDonna,
I don't know the answer.

13:09.079 --> 13:13.417
Okay. Well, until you do,
TV remains off.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.837
Where's Mama?

13:26.472 --> 13:31.018

Hi, Rick. Can we talk a second?

13:53.457 --> 13:55.417
You're here late.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.712
What's up?

13:58.712 --> 14:00.589
Rick, we all thought that
this was the year

14:00.589 --> 14:02.049
for your promotion
to the day shift,

14:02.049 --> 14:04.635
but it... it didn't happen.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.471
I... I don't understand.

14:08.681 --> 14:09.974
What happened?
You said I had it.

14:09.974 --> 14:13.727
I-I know, I know.
It just wasn't the time.

14:13.727 --> 14:14.770
Maybe next year.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.146
I've been here for six years, Harriet.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.233
I know.
And I went to bat for you.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.239
I'm real sorry.

14:26.323 --> 14:28.200
Have a good night.

15:27.843 --> 15:30.054
Harriet says
she went to bat for me.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.722
Yeah, I don't trust any of them.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.183
What am I gonna do?
Look for a new job?

15:34.183 --> 15:35.517
I got bills, man.

15:35.517 --> 15:38.687
Look, Rick, we are pawns
on a chess board, man.

15:38.687 --> 15:39.939
Expendable.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.316
So stop thinking
they care about us.

15:43.317 --> 15:47.488
Why are you so cynical, man?

15:47.488 --> 15:50.824
Because I'm Black at a bank,
making $3.35 an hour.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.076
Why <i>aren't</i> you cynical?

15:52.076 --> 15:54.203
I still think there are
good people at the bank,

15:54.203 --> 15:56.580
- like Harriet.
- Ah.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.502
Alright, check this out. Go on.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.631
So my boy Joe Simmons,
he investigated this.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.509
So look, he noticed there was
a $1 discrepancy

16:08.509 --> 16:10.761
in everyone's paychecks
for three years.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.012
Yeah, that's a hell
of a lot of money.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.889
You're goddamn right it is.

16:13.889 --> 16:18.060
Alright, so Joe, he decided to
do this statistical analysis.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.979
He then had this meeting
with Harriet.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.188
<i>Wait, wait, wait, hold up.</i>

16:21.188 --> 16:22.272
<i>Wait. That's-- That's--</i>

16:22.272 --> 16:24.191
- Yo, that's big-time.
- Yeah.

16:24.191 --> 16:28.737
Joe calculated he saved
the bank $12 million.

16:28.737 --> 16:32.074
So Joe said they found
the guy responsible.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.575
<i>Just some guy,</i>

16:33.575 --> 16:35.536
<i>and he's still working
at the bank. And you know</i>

16:35.536 --> 16:37.121
<i>- if he looks like you or me--</i>
-  <i>Would not still</i>

16:37.121 --> 16:38.831
<i>- be working at the bank.
- You're damn right.</i>

16:38.831 --> 16:42.668
Joe said they probably
docked his pay.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.837
Yo, that's not even
the worst part.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.296
You know what Joe got?

16:46.296 --> 16:48.507
<i>He got a freakin' dinner
at a Ponderosa.</i>

16:48.507 --> 16:49.758
<i>Ugh.</i>

16:49.758 --> 16:53.220
<i>Nice little "Attaboy, Joe."</i>

16:55.848 --> 16:56.849
Man, I need a break.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.892
I got to find a way
to make some money.

16:58.892 --> 17:03.355
Man, Rick, either you buy
what they are selling,

17:03.355 --> 17:08.318
which is hope,
pray they advance you.

17:08.318 --> 17:12.239
Or you just let it go
and move on.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.421
Yes!

17:29.715 --> 17:33.218
This is LaDonna Paige,
Transfer Operations Department.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.722
This call is being recorded
for security purposes.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.892
Oh, good morning, Mr. Davis.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.935
Hmm. How are your kids doing?

17:41.935 --> 17:44.730
Back in school? That is great.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.441
Oh, you would like to transfer

17:47.441 --> 17:52.071
$5,150,000.

17:52.071 --> 17:55.282
And what is your transfer code?

17:55.282 --> 17:58.202
Mm, I will repeat that back.

17:58.202 --> 18:01.038
5-9-star-

18:01.038 --> 18:05.918
5-9-1-8-3-1-5-2.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.045
That is correct.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.799
Please hold for
a second confirmation.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.384
Come on, one more big bite.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.969
We got to say bye to Daddy.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.805
But I'm eating this apple.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.139
Then finish the one you have.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.891
Hey, Pumpkin,
you want a cookie?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.101
- Mm-hmm?
- Just one.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.561
But I wanted--
But I just ate one.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.730
-  Come on, one more.
-  You're gonna get one.

18:26.730 --> 18:27.898
Mm-hmm. Okay, come on.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.441
Let's say bye to Daddy.
Here, put it down.

18:31.235 --> 18:34.655
Where the hell
are we supposed to go, huh?!

18:34.655 --> 18:36.323
I don't know!
You got a husband! Ask his ass.

18:36.323 --> 18:38.033
That ain't right!
That ain't right!

18:38.033 --> 18:39.660
It ain't right
what you did, though.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.286
You promised.
You can burn in hell.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.746
Burn in hell?

18:42.746 --> 18:44.623
Burn in goddamn hell!
You can burn in hell!

18:44.623 --> 18:47.626
- You can't say that to me, Renee
- Stuff it, Tyree! Hey, Danny.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.003
Hey, look here, Danny.
This is my place, alright?

18:50.003 --> 18:52.172
Nobody tell you to bring
these old boxes

18:52.172 --> 18:53.799
of nerdy-ass comic books
in here anyway.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.426
And if I tell you get them out
my living room, I mean it.

18:56.426 --> 18:58.137
And I already told
my sister this,

18:58.137 --> 18:59.054
and I'm telling you.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.140
As soon as that baby drops,

19:01.140 --> 19:02.724
y'all best find
new accommodations

19:02.724 --> 19:05.310
so I can bring my honeys home
and get back to my life.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.186
You feel me?

19:06.186 --> 19:08.772
Tyree, thank you for that.

19:08.772 --> 19:13.402
Also, I really need you
to stop shouting at me!

19:13.402 --> 19:15.362
Knock it off!

19:15.362 --> 19:17.823
I'm going to work.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.971
What you doing in Chicago?

19:40.971 --> 19:43.348
Memorial service for my brother.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.392
Hm.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.937
So, Jeremy,
I got your message.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.439
Here we are. What's going down?

19:50.439 --> 19:53.233
I'm contemplating a big bank.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.860
You ever work with amateurs?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.904
One of my best scores.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.947
Your amateurs inside?

19:58.947 --> 20:00.532
In good positions.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.911
But you're not convinced.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.662
You know the system?

20:05.662 --> 20:06.997
Very well.

20:06.997 --> 20:10.125
Let's just say the weakness
in the banking system

20:10.125 --> 20:12.127
needs to be tested.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.046
Forty years in the game.

20:14.046 --> 20:18.508
Technology changes.
Gadgets and shit come and go.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.970
But nothing beats
working with people

20:21.970 --> 20:24.514
who want what you want.

20:24.514 --> 20:25.933
Here are the keys.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.061
It's an empty space
over on Washington.

20:29.061 --> 20:32.022
Should be pretty private.

20:32.022 --> 20:35.275
That picture looks
very familiar.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.277
You have the real one, Ray.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.363
We took it together.
Don't you remember?

20:39.363 --> 20:41.365
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:41.365 --> 20:45.619
- You're absolutely right.
- Yes.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.871
But, Jeremy...

20:49.289 --> 20:51.458
- Breeze Air?
- Was a disaster.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.126
It was more than that.

20:53.126 --> 20:56.171
I was this close to
being back inside.

20:56.171 --> 20:59.258
Now, if you want to
remain my friend...

20:59.258 --> 21:00.509
You're more than my friend, Ray.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.053
If you want to <i>remain</i>
my friend...

21:04.179 --> 21:06.473
let's forget about what happened

21:06.473 --> 21:09.643
and pledge
never to work together again.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.020
Can we make that deal?

21:17.025 --> 21:19.528
Have you even spoken to Bree?

21:43.719 --> 21:45.137
Let's go for a walk.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.014
What are you doing here, Jeremy?

21:47.014 --> 21:50.851
I-I admit Breeze Air was a bust.

21:50.851 --> 21:54.021
It could have worked.
If your guy wasn't so greedy.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.315
<i>My</i> guy? Wha--? <i>My</i> guy?

21:56.315 --> 21:57.566
<i>You</i> brought him in.

21:57.566 --> 22:00.444
Are you serious right now?
I was dating Zach.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.821
Nobody told you to recruit him.

22:07.117 --> 22:11.163
Look, we both...

22:11.163 --> 22:12.748
let the wrong guy in.

22:12.748 --> 22:15.417
Yes, we did.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.128
Both let the wrong guy in.

22:18.128 --> 22:22.466
But I have
another opportunity for you.

22:22.466 --> 22:26.470
Ha! I am not messing
with you anymore, Jeremy.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.805
What, you--
You haven't even heard me out.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.182
I don't care!

22:30.182 --> 22:31.391
Right now, I am working

22:31.391 --> 22:34.394
a straight gig
getting this guy elected.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.480
Politics?

22:36.480 --> 22:39.316
Yes, politics.
It's the same game.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.443
Just simple misdirection.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.988
And a steady paycheck.

22:44.988 --> 22:47.115
But you know what, Jeremy?
I've lost my appetite.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.617
I've got to get back to work, alright?

22:48.617 --> 22:51.036
No, no, no, no, no.
Please don't say that.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.080
No. It was fun while it lasted.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.582
Yeah, just leave Chicago, hm?

22:55.582 --> 22:58.418
Forget this opportunity.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.590
Bye, Jeremy.

23:09.304 --> 23:11.556
-  Fed up. Okay?
-  Okay.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.308
I'm fed up with Tyree.

23:13.308 --> 23:14.309
You know what?

23:14.309 --> 23:17.396
Neither one of y'all
are pregnant, okay?

23:17.396 --> 23:18.563
Neither one of y'all.

23:18.563 --> 23:19.606
I know. I know. I know.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.066
We're not--
We're not making enough.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.150
But if you're making enough.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.111
- Nothing else I can do.
- Figure it out!

23:24.111 --> 23:25.612
- Okay! Help me!
- I can't!

23:25.612 --> 23:27.197
Get us out of this house, Danny.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.074
Ma, I promise,
as soon as I get a raise,

23:29.074 --> 23:30.367
no more riding this bus to work.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.369
- Alright, alright.
- I'll be here. I'll be here.

23:35.330 --> 23:37.124
Open up! Open up!

23:37.124 --> 23:40.001
You okay? I love you. You okay?

23:52.973 --> 23:54.391
Please, no!

23:54.391 --> 23:56.226
Just one drink.

24:20.167 --> 24:23.753
Just leave Chicago, hmm?
Forget this opportunity.

<i>...surrender in 21 days.</i>

24:25.422 --> 24:28.049

<i>to bring you back

24:34.222 --> 24:35.849
But nothing beats
working with people

who want what you want.

25:14.554 --> 25:17.807
Are we in the right place
for the business opportunity?

25:17.807 --> 25:19.309
Yes. Come in.

25:19.309 --> 25:22.437
I'm glad you're all here
for the presentation.

25:22.437 --> 25:24.981
Please, take a seat.

25:25.732 --> 25:26.858
What's up, Unc?

25:27.484 --> 25:30.862
I invited you all here
to present a proposal to y'all

25:30.862 --> 25:32.614
because I respect you.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.991
There's $500 in the envelope
in front of you.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.409
It's yours for being here.

25:36.409 --> 25:39.079
Part of
the business opportunity.

25:39.663 --> 25:43.291
You three work at one of
the largest banks in the country

25:43.291 --> 25:48.713
using wire transfer
with voice phone confirmations.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.299
Now, let me be clear.

25:51.299 --> 25:55.762
Everything I'm going to say
to you here I've done before.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.472
Done what? Why are we here?

25:57.472 --> 25:59.307
- What is this about?
- I will show you

25:59.307 --> 26:02.769
how to move money
from corporate bank accounts

26:02.769 --> 26:04.938
to your own bank account.

26:07.274 --> 26:10.360
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Hear him out. Alright?

26:10.360 --> 26:13.780
Just hear him out. Sit down.

26:21.371 --> 26:25.333
Everything you see here...

26:25.333 --> 26:27.752
- I own.
- Damn, Unc!

26:27.752 --> 26:29.504
Where you get all this?

26:29.504 --> 26:30.714
I've created wealth for myself

26:30.714 --> 26:33.675
by understanding
that a bank's loss

26:33.675 --> 26:35.051
is my gain.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.639
I know their system.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.182
Banks lose funds every year.

26:41.182 --> 26:46.021
They're careless, bloated,
top-heavy, and inefficient.

26:47.647 --> 26:51.901
Your jobs will be gone
very soon.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.653
You've been
at the bank for years.

26:53.653 --> 26:56.615
No savings to speak of,
no college degrees,

26:56.615 --> 26:58.658
no opportunities
for advancement.

26:58.658 --> 27:00.827
- Am I wrong?
- Yeah. What's it to you?

27:00.827 --> 27:03.663
You don't know the first thing
about our lives anyway.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.791
I've seen your lives.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.336
I know how each
of you are living.

27:10.378 --> 27:11.880
You want
better lives for yourselves,

27:11.880 --> 27:13.131
for your families.

27:14.883 --> 27:15.842
Help me rob

27:46.581 --> 27:49.084
But you have the transfer codes.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.335
They change every hour,

27:50.335 --> 27:52.253
but you have
access to them, yes?

27:52.253 --> 27:54.756
Every transfer needs
a second confirmation

27:54.756 --> 27:56.591
from the corporation.

27:56.591 --> 27:59.386
That is why my plan works.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.970
We set it up so that Danny

28:00.970 --> 28:03.807
or Rick receive
that second call.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.974
Instead of the company's number,

28:04.974 --> 28:06.393
LaDonna will have

28:06.393 --> 28:07.936
a different number to call.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.313
And we will control that call

28:10.313 --> 28:13.191
because we will be
that executive.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.401
That's crazy.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.027
How are we going to be
that executive?

28:16.027 --> 28:17.737
I will train your voices
to sound like

28:17.737 --> 28:20.657
the corporate officers
approving the transfers.

28:20.657 --> 28:25.787
The transfer's confirmed,
millions to our accounts.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.998
The system has a glitch.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.501
We take advantage of it,
get rich,

28:31.501 --> 28:33.086
then leave the country.

28:33.086 --> 28:34.421
We have family here.

28:34.421 --> 28:36.548
And you'll be millionaires.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.299
They will join you.

28:41.636 --> 28:43.930
You said this money
is mine, right?

28:43.930 --> 28:45.265
Yes.

28:48.435 --> 28:52.731
Good, because I'm taking
my Black ass home.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.775
That's your prerogative.

28:57.944 --> 28:59.154
And you know what?

28:59.154 --> 29:01.406
I could call the police on you

29:01.406 --> 29:02.991
and tell the bank, too.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.410
Why would you do that,

29:05.410 --> 29:08.246
when you stand to have millions?

29:09.706 --> 29:10.915
Go.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.002
If I never speak to you again,

29:14.002 --> 29:17.797
at least you'll be $500 richer.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.387
With a new Rolex.

29:43.656 --> 29:45.533
Make a list of all
the corporate officers

29:45.533 --> 29:49.204
requesting
wire transfers weekly.

29:49.204 --> 29:52.791
Don't take too long to decide.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.918
I'm seeing other people.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.976
-  Yo, freeze.

30:11.976 --> 30:15.480
Shut up!
You know what time it is.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.857
-  Oh, shit.
- Shut up!

30:20.026 --> 30:21.569
- Watch.
-  Got no watch.

30:21.569 --> 30:24.906
- Wallet.
- Just going real slow, brother.

30:24.906 --> 30:26.574
- Going real slow.
-  Oh, shit.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.785
- There you go.
- Give me the briefcase.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.078
Now stop. That's enough.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.038
Give me the briefcase!

30:32.038 --> 30:34.374
- No.
- Just give it to him, Unc!

30:37.335 --> 30:38.419
Drop it.

30:38.419 --> 30:39.921
Shit!

30:40.338 --> 30:42.006
Ah!

30:45.260 --> 30:46.886
Just shot him?

30:51.683 --> 30:55.311
I really look forward to seeing
you all real soon.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.105
Really.

30:59.440 --> 31:03.319
<i>down-tempo music</i>

31:03.319 --> 31:05.613
Danny is my man! Okay?

31:05.613 --> 31:06.823
He ain't acting like it!

31:06.823 --> 31:07.866
And you!

31:07.866 --> 31:10.368
And you ain't acting
like a brother!

31:23.840 --> 31:24.966
Ah!

31:24.966 --> 31:26.551
Damn it.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.943
That's ten grand. Alright?

31:44.736 --> 31:47.280
But you best never lay
hands on me again.

31:50.950 --> 31:53.786
I am not
clearing checks till I'm 50.

31:53.786 --> 31:54.913
Are you?

31:54.913 --> 31:57.290
What Mr. Horne's proposing
could work.

31:57.290 --> 31:58.499
Mmm.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.295
Mr. Horne
ain't trying to save us.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.922
He needs us.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.090
We need him.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.300
I don't need anybody.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.094
What is your problem, man?

32:10.094 --> 32:11.971
- Why us?
- Why not us?

32:11.971 --> 32:14.098
This is literally
like a lottery ticket.

32:14.098 --> 32:17.101
To be accurate, the odds
on a single lottery ticket

32:17.101 --> 32:19.896
are 800,500,000 to 1.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.856
This is far better.

32:21.856 --> 32:23.232
I don't know about you, Rick,

32:23.232 --> 32:26.235
but I'm tired of
living like I'm living.

32:26.235 --> 32:28.029
I've checked Mr. Horne's facts.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.656
He's right.

32:29.656 --> 32:31.616
We can redirect
that second call anywhere.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.993
My house. Your house.
A phone booth.

32:33.993 --> 32:35.286
When the first call come in,

32:35.286 --> 32:37.163
I'll just call the number
he gives me

32:37.163 --> 32:38.873
and use the current code.

32:38.873 --> 32:43.211
And if I'm the first call,
Rick got to be the second.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.046
It's just risky as hell.

32:45.046 --> 32:47.548
Yo! Man, y'all got lunch?

32:47.548 --> 32:50.885
Man, you know, I filmed
a music video right here.

32:50.885 --> 32:51.928
Mm, look at that view.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.346
Marshall,
is your uncle for real?

32:53.346 --> 32:55.223
'Cause he coming on strong,
like a bull.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.599
Here's the deal. Alright?

32:56.599 --> 32:58.851
The last thing my dad told me
before he died

32:58.851 --> 33:01.729
was to stay away
from my Uncle Jeremy.

33:01.729 --> 33:04.023
Is he real?

33:04.023 --> 33:06.776
Yeah. Real as a heart attack.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.653
But you don't work at the bank.

33:08.653 --> 33:09.779
What does he want you to do?

33:09.779 --> 33:12.073
Shit. Whatever he wants.
I work for him.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.534
- Bro, you're a criminal?
- We're not criminals.

33:14.534 --> 33:17.537
Look, I call it payback
for being born Black.

33:18.079 --> 33:20.748
Say that again when you're
sitting in the jail cell.

33:20.748 --> 33:22.208
You know what? I'm sick of you.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.669
You dress like you went to
some top school,

33:24.669 --> 33:27.338
and you act like you better
than us half the time.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.090
And what now, Rick? Huh?

33:29.090 --> 33:30.091
You punking out?

33:30.091 --> 33:33.761
This is our chance.
Don't you see that?

33:33.761 --> 33:35.513
That's real talk, Rick.

33:35.888 --> 33:40.435
We are talking about robbing
a goddamn bank.

33:40.435 --> 33:41.853
Where we work!

33:41.853 --> 33:45.273
Hey, look, man, Jeremy Horne
knows what he's doing. Alright?

33:45.273 --> 33:46.899
Look, we listen, learn,

33:46.899 --> 33:49.277
get this money,
and never look back.

33:49.277 --> 33:52.822
We pull this off,
we gonna own Chicago.

33:52.822 --> 33:56.743
We pull this off, we'll never be
able to live in Chicago again.

33:56.743 --> 33:59.078
Are you ready for that,
Mr. King of House?

33:59.078 --> 34:00.204
Hell, yeah!

34:00.204 --> 34:01.330
Shit, we get this money,

34:01.330 --> 34:03.416
we put this music
out everywhere.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.667
Alright?

34:11.883 --> 34:13.259
All in or what?

34:13.259 --> 34:15.094
Come on, Danny.

34:28.107 --> 34:31.152
Rick, we do this
together or not.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.615
Come on, man.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.755
Let's get paid.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.427
Here are all the names
you requested.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.638
Thank you, LaDonna.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.266
We focus on these five. Why?

35:02.266 --> 35:03.893
- They keep large balances.
- What else?

35:03.893 --> 35:07.647
The balances are not
checked for 48 to 72 hours.

35:07.647 --> 35:12.110
Which means that we can
make transfers that land clear

35:12.110 --> 35:14.612
and can be withdrawn
in that gap time.

35:14.612 --> 35:18.658
By then, the money will be
long gone, but so will we.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.660
Nicely done.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.036
These are our accounts

35:22.036 --> 35:23.287
in the Bank of Geneva, Switzerland,

35:23.287 --> 35:26.082
for our company,
Strand Investments, LLC.

35:26.082 --> 35:29.001
I'm the chairman.
You're all board members.

35:29.001 --> 35:30.795
These are our targets.

35:30.795 --> 35:33.631
Learn their lives,
how they speak, what they love,

35:33.631 --> 35:34.882
who they love.

35:34.882 --> 35:37.844
Learn this information
and destroy it.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.971
This is Mark Hamilton,

35:39.971 --> 35:42.306
corporate officer
at Northern Levers,

35:42.306 --> 35:45.518
- lives in Wilmette.
- I know. I speak to him weekly.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.353
Good. Well, then
you'll follow him.

35:47.353 --> 35:49.188
Learn everything about him.

35:49.188 --> 35:51.023
This is a team effort.

35:51.023 --> 35:52.733
Are we ready?

35:53.651 --> 35:56.154
Watch and learn.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.197
<i>First step,
get close to your target</i>

35:58.197 --> 35:59.490
<i>with the tape recorder.</i>

35:59.490 --> 36:01.075
<i>Then let them talk.</i>

36:01.075 --> 36:02.910
<i>With the recordings, we listen</i>

36:02.910 --> 36:05.621
<i>and learn
the details of their lives</i>

36:05.621 --> 36:07.039
<i>and how they speak.</i>

36:07.039 --> 36:09.750
<i>Then we mimic their voices.</i>

36:28.561 --> 36:29.937
Excuse me.

36:29.937 --> 36:31.230
Good evening, you two.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.774
I'm Sandy Johnson.
I'm with the US Census.

36:33.774 --> 36:36.110
We do know that
you did fill out your census.

36:36.110 --> 36:38.070
I'm just here with a few
follow-up questions.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.155
Okay. Shoot.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.656
<i>...for me to be happy</i>

36:40.656 --> 36:43.618
<i>and my wife to show off.</i>

36:43.618 --> 36:46.162
<i>Long hours at the office.</i>

36:46.162 --> 36:48.414
<i>I need a comfort car.</i>

36:48.414 --> 36:49.999
Yeah. This guy's an asshole.

36:49.999 --> 36:52.168
These are the facts of his life.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.045
The small talk, his truth.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.880
Listen to this and learn.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.340
I bought the BMW

36:57.340 --> 36:59.008
for me to be happy

36:59.008 --> 37:01.636
and for my wife to show off.

37:01.636 --> 37:04.180
Long hours at the office.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.556
I need a comfort car.

37:06.974 --> 37:09.936
Not bad. Hey, look, um,

37:09.936 --> 37:11.854
I need birth dates,
place of births,

37:11.854 --> 37:14.023
and also I need photos.
Okay? ASAP.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.025
- What for?
- Passports.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.360
<i>Jeremy Horne,</i>

37:17.360 --> 37:19.362
<i>this is Mr. Podesky
from the Wayne County</i>

37:19.362 --> 37:21.447
<i>Pre-Incarceration Services
calling you again.</i>

37:21.447 --> 37:24.283
<i>We are aware that
you are currently in Chicago.</i>

37:24.283 --> 37:25.493
<i>You have not checked in.</i>

37:25.493 --> 37:27.078
<i>We must hear
from you immediately</i>

37:27.078 --> 37:28.871
<i>to confirm your surrender,
or we're sending</i>

37:28.871 --> 37:30.248
<i>federal marshals
to bring you in.</i>

37:30.248 --> 37:32.208
-  What do we want?
-  Justice!

37:32.208 --> 37:34.043
-  When do we want it?
-  Now!

37:34.043 --> 37:35.962
-  What do we want?
-  Justice!

37:35.962 --> 37:37.838
-  When do we want it?
-  Now!

37:37.838 --> 37:39.840
-  What do we want?
-  Justice!

37:39.840 --> 37:41.384
-  When do we want it?
-  Now!

37:41.384 --> 37:44.387
-  What do we want?
-  Justice!

37:44.387 --> 37:45.972
On the day,

37:45.972 --> 37:47.056
LaDonna, Danny, and Rick

37:47.056 --> 37:48.349
will blend in to this crowd

37:48.349 --> 37:49.809
for cover when leaving the bank.

37:49.809 --> 37:53.229
Marshall drives up,
everybody gets in one by one,

37:53.229 --> 37:54.355
- and we go.
- Got you, Unc.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.606
Let's go over it again.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.525
Step by step. Marshall?

37:57.525 --> 38:00.027
8:00 a.m., I'm gonna
check on the flights,

38:00.027 --> 38:01.028
travel to O'Hare,

38:01.028 --> 38:02.446
gas up the car,
confirm where to hide.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.699
- LaDonna?
- Leave my place by 8:00 a.m.

38:04.699 --> 38:05.658
Get on the train.

38:05.658 --> 38:07.076
- Be at my desk by 8:30.
- Danny?

38:07.076 --> 38:08.869
8:00 a.m., wrap up work
on the night shift,

38:08.869 --> 38:11.080
drop off the comic book
to my boy in the wire room,

38:11.080 --> 38:12.957
talk and occupy him
while listening for

38:12.957 --> 38:14.417
incoming corporate
transfer calls.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.544
- Rick?
- 8:00 a.m., get off work,

38:16.544 --> 38:18.838
get on subway,
make it home by 8:30.

38:18.838 --> 38:21.424
I'll be at Dearborn,
outside the bank at 8:30.

38:21.424 --> 38:24.468
We're on, transfer everything
by 10:00. Understood?

38:24.468 --> 38:25.845
Got it.

38:27.388 --> 38:30.975
We will use these pagers
to communicate on the big day.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.560
Our codes will be simple.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.186
One is approved.

38:34.186 --> 38:35.438
Two is stop.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.231
And three is hurry.

38:37.231 --> 38:38.607
Memorize this.

38:38.607 --> 38:41.902
- Danny, you're up.
-  Ready.

38:41.902 --> 38:44.030
<i>Well, I like to
deal with my employees</i>

38:44.030 --> 38:46.657
<i>- in a very specific way.</i>
-  Okay.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.619
Well, I like to deal

38:50.619 --> 38:53.497
with my employees
in a very specific way.

38:53.497 --> 38:56.292
- Yes?
- I'd say.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.379
Our company really wants people

39:00.379 --> 39:02.548
who understand the culture

39:02.548 --> 39:05.426
and understand the tools, uh,

39:05.426 --> 39:09.055
that I think really make us
the best company to work for.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.307
And that's how it's done!

39:11.307 --> 39:13.851
- Boom! You see that?
- Yes!

39:15.478 --> 39:18.647
Ah, it's Geneva with an "E."

39:20.066 --> 39:22.526
Why I'm the only one
to get called out like that?

39:22.526 --> 39:24.320
Yes. Thank you so much.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.738
- He's going to appreciate it.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.907
Alright. Thank you. Bye-bye.

39:31.660 --> 39:34.747
Hello. Oh. Thank you.

39:42.254 --> 39:45.508
This is Check Clearing
and the Transfers Department.

39:45.508 --> 39:48.177
Everyone here,
with their years of experience,

39:48.177 --> 39:51.347
have helped decrease
clearance times considerably.

39:51.347 --> 39:54.642
Hmm.
We hear about computerization

39:54.642 --> 39:56.060
across all departments.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.687
You are prepared for this?
Do you feel ready?

39:58.687 --> 40:01.607
Yes. We have already
started the transition.

40:01.607 --> 40:05.194
In two weeks, this department
will be completely computerized

40:05.194 --> 40:06.362
with a new system in place.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.781
So verbal confirmations
of funds transferred

40:08.781 --> 40:10.783
will no longer be necessary.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.243
First National Bank of Chicago

40:12.243 --> 40:15.955
should be fully computerized
by the end of the month.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.465
Mr. Horne,
we have a big problem.

40:26.465 --> 40:28.717
If we want this to happen,
we need to move now.

40:28.717 --> 40:31.303
The bank is computerizing
top to bottom.

40:31.303 --> 40:33.556
Accounting, auditing,
check clearing,

40:33.556 --> 40:35.433
and wire transfers.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.809
Shit.

40:38.477 --> 40:41.647
The department keeps the updated
account balances on printouts.

40:41.647 --> 40:44.442
<i>Harriet gets a copy
from her secretary daily.</i>

40:44.442 --> 40:46.694
<i>A duplicate copy
is kept on ledgers</i>

40:46.694 --> 40:48.779
<i>on the 11th floor
in the machine room</i>

40:48.779 --> 40:50.281
<i>next to Harriet's office.</i>

40:50.281 --> 40:51.323
<i>Nowhere else.</i>

40:51.323 --> 40:52.950
<i>The only way to get
in that room</i>

40:52.950 --> 40:54.243
<i>is with a key card.</i>

40:54.243 --> 40:56.412
I mean, I could get the codes, but...

40:56.412 --> 40:57.496
Without the printouts

40:57.496 --> 40:59.290
with the current balances,
we can't move.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.624
We won't know the balances,

41:00.624 --> 41:04.336
- but I could estimate based on--
- No, it's too risky.

41:04.336 --> 41:07.423
I need to go in the bank
and get the printouts.

41:07.423 --> 41:10.593
And I need key cards.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.845
Is this really gonna happen,
Mr. Horne?

41:12.845 --> 41:14.805
New plan.

41:15.764 --> 41:19.268
Instead of going after
the entire $235 million,

41:19.268 --> 41:22.271
we will target the $80 million

41:22.271 --> 41:25.441
from the three companies
you speak to daily.

41:25.441 --> 41:30.196
So it's on Rick to handle
the second confirmation.

41:30.196 --> 41:32.198
He will be
the corporate officers

41:32.198 --> 41:35.284
from Ben Holland Distillers,

41:35.284 --> 41:37.912
Kebler Byers,

41:37.912 --> 41:40.956
Northern Levers.

41:40.956 --> 41:42.291
Call Rick,

41:42.291 --> 41:45.377
tell him he must get a meeting
with Harriet for Friday morning

41:45.377 --> 41:49.006
and a key card
for the computer room.

41:49.006 --> 41:51.425
LaDonna, okay?

42:03.771 --> 42:05.481
Buddha Ray,
what are you doing here?

42:05.481 --> 42:07.900
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

42:09.193 --> 42:11.904
I think I need to get up
out of here.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.698
Yeah.

42:17.910 --> 42:19.787
Good to see you.

42:20.246 --> 42:22.540
I'm so glad you could make it.

42:22.540 --> 42:25.584
Oh, please, sit, sit.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.587
Wonderful.

42:30.297 --> 42:32.758
If a SWAT team rolls up
on us right now,

42:32.758 --> 42:34.802
I will never forgive you.

42:34.802 --> 42:35.928
Fear not, Buddha Ray.

42:35.928 --> 42:38.847
We're just here having
a lovely dinner.

42:38.847 --> 42:40.849
When was the last time
we were all together?

42:40.849 --> 42:45.396
Detroit. Breeze Air, Jeremy.
The bane of my existence.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.565
I second that.

42:47.565 --> 42:52.027
I know the awkward position
I put you in recently.

42:52.027 --> 42:53.320
Awkward?

42:53.320 --> 42:55.864
Unbelievable.

42:55.864 --> 42:58.784
See, I can't speak for
Buddha Ray, but,

42:58.784 --> 43:01.328
Jeremy, life is much too short.

43:01.328 --> 43:05.291
And that's why
I've asked you both here.

43:06.709 --> 43:09.461
Shit, Jeremy,
a tracking bracelet?

43:09.461 --> 43:10.629
What'd you do now?

43:10.629 --> 43:14.300
I'm going to do five
for Breeze Air.

43:15.884 --> 43:19.513
Zach got probation naming names.

43:19.513 --> 43:22.349
And instead of him burning you,

43:24.059 --> 43:25.811
I took a plea.

43:25.811 --> 43:28.689
I surrender in a few weeks.

43:28.689 --> 43:30.566
So this is one last score?

43:30.566 --> 43:32.151
$80 million.

43:33.944 --> 43:38.198
So, well,
you'll be set when you get out.

43:38.198 --> 43:40.993
No, no, no.
I'm doing this score for you.

43:40.993 --> 43:42.661
You both get part of the split

43:42.661 --> 43:44.997
because I blew it
for Breeze Air, you're family.

43:44.997 --> 43:48.125
I needed to make it right.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.754
This is not free money.

43:51.754 --> 43:53.464
What do you need, Jeremy?

43:53.464 --> 43:55.466
Two hours this Friday.

43:55.466 --> 43:58.510
You're a pair of bank auditors.
You're not the show.

43:58.510 --> 44:00.929
You're decoys
so I can grab some intel.

44:00.929 --> 44:03.265
You're in and out.

44:03.265 --> 44:06.268
This last go-round
really didn't sit well with me.

44:06.268 --> 44:09.396
I shouldn't even be thinking
about this shit, but...

44:09.396 --> 44:11.357
screw it!

44:11.357 --> 44:13.817
Any opportunity to stick it
to the man

44:13.817 --> 44:16.278
is worth my time and attention.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.657
- Whatever you need.
- Just like that?

44:19.657 --> 44:23.118
Bree, we stick together.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.830
We always stick together, right?

44:28.874 --> 44:30.167
Right.

44:31.251 --> 44:32.419
Now,

44:32.419 --> 44:36.924
you two need to
get your shit together.

44:38.717 --> 44:40.219
Okay.

44:42.471 --> 44:45.474
Contact me with the particulars.

44:45.474 --> 44:50.521
Now I'm-- I'm going to go
soak my veins in some Popeye's.

44:50.521 --> 44:53.190
This shit is too rich
for my blood.

45:06.495 --> 45:10.040
The white gloves always work,
and you know it.

45:19.883 --> 45:21.260
Rick Lewis!

45:24.263 --> 45:25.764
It's great to see you.

45:25.764 --> 45:28.559
- Are you here watching the game?
- Yep.

45:28.559 --> 45:29.893
This is my husband, John.

45:29.893 --> 45:31.937
John works
for the Board of Trade.

45:31.937 --> 45:34.732
Honey, this is
Rick Lewis from the bank.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.650
Oh, yes.

45:36.650 --> 45:38.360
Harriet is very high on you.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.988
Said you're headed for bigger
and better places.

45:40.988 --> 45:42.114
Yeah.

45:42.114 --> 45:44.408
Would you like to join us?

45:45.200 --> 45:46.702
I'd love to.

45:46.702 --> 45:47.745
Great.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.204
I love finance.

45:49.204 --> 45:51.915
You know, stocks, bonds.

45:51.915 --> 45:54.460
I've really studied it
for some while now.

45:54.460 --> 45:57.963
But they say that you learn
when you're on the floor.

45:57.963 --> 45:59.131
Now, that's true.

45:59.131 --> 46:02.468
College isn't always
that important for this,

46:02.468 --> 46:05.012
just sharp decision-making.

46:05.012 --> 46:08.640
I have a market maker
trainee position open.

46:08.640 --> 46:13.020
It pays a competitive rate
with room for advancement.

46:13.020 --> 46:15.439
It's yours if you want it.

46:15.439 --> 46:16.899
I could arrange for you

46:16.899 --> 46:20.068
to transition out of
the bank in 30 days.

46:20.068 --> 46:22.070
It's more money. A new career.

46:22.070 --> 46:23.864
I would be sad to see you go.

46:23.864 --> 46:26.992
Wow.

46:27.993 --> 46:30.662
Uh, Harriet, I...

46:30.662 --> 46:33.957
C-Can-- Can we meet
in your office on Friday t-to--

46:33.957 --> 46:35.125
to talk about everything?

46:35.125 --> 46:38.045
I can stay after my shift.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.922
How's 10:00 a.m.?

46:40.130 --> 46:42.925
Perfect. That's per--

46:42.925 --> 46:44.009
More wine?

46:44.009 --> 46:45.677
-  Please.
-  Yes.

47:20.754 --> 47:22.130
Unexpected.

47:26.844 --> 47:28.220
What's up?

47:28.971 --> 47:31.056
I need to talk to you.

47:31.765 --> 47:33.225
Talk.

47:34.434 --> 47:35.936
Wow.

47:37.229 --> 47:40.232
This is a nice place.

47:40.232 --> 47:42.526
It'll do in a pinch.

47:49.116 --> 47:50.033
Talk.

47:50.033 --> 47:52.160
Uh, okay. Um...

47:53.287 --> 47:54.580
Well...

47:56.415 --> 47:57.541
Uh...

47:57.541 --> 47:59.001
Everything's set with Harriet,

47:59.167 --> 48:00.711
10:00 a.m. Her office.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.171
The computer room
is right next door.

48:04.172 --> 48:06.216
Here's the key card to get in.

48:06.216 --> 48:07.926
Good job.

48:07.926 --> 48:11.221
But you could have given this
to me at our next meet-up.

48:11.221 --> 48:13.056
Why are you here tonight?

48:13.056 --> 48:15.726
Harriet's husband works
for the Board of Trade.

48:15.726 --> 48:16.727
Okay.

48:16.727 --> 48:18.896
And he just offered me
a great job.

48:18.896 --> 48:21.732
I-I've always wanted to work
at the Board of Trade.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.859
They want me to start
in 30 days.

48:23.859 --> 48:26.069
In 30 days,
you'll be worth millions.

48:26.069 --> 48:27.404
I-I know, but

48:27.404 --> 48:31.241
this is like a really huge
opportunity for me.

48:31.992 --> 48:33.410
Promises.

48:34.912 --> 48:37.164
You can fill the seas
with the promises

48:37.164 --> 48:39.541
made to Black folks
in this country,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.878
but nothing's
going to change until...

48:42.878 --> 48:45.213
we do what needs to be done.

48:45.213 --> 48:47.716
And after the millions are
in your account,

48:47.716 --> 48:49.927
I think you'll feel like I do.

48:49.927 --> 48:53.388
The power to do
anything for anyone.

48:53.722 --> 48:56.266
I do. I honestly
do want to help people.

48:56.266 --> 48:58.977
Mm-hmm. And you will.

49:01.396 --> 49:03.148
Why do you want to do this?

49:04.733 --> 49:09.154
Because the system
needs to be tested.

49:17.120 --> 49:19.790
They-- They tried
to rob you, Mr. Horne.

49:19.790 --> 49:21.166
That is correct.

49:21.166 --> 49:23.543
And they work for me.

49:24.086 --> 49:25.504
At home,

49:25.504 --> 49:27.923
do you have a cordless,
touch-tone phone

49:27.923 --> 49:29.883
or a rotary dial phone?

49:29.883 --> 49:33.470
A rotary. It's on my wall.

49:35.097 --> 49:37.307
Okay. Take that, please.

49:39.768 --> 49:41.061
On transfer day,

49:41.061 --> 49:45.190
unplug your home phone
and plug that one in.

49:47.025 --> 49:49.361
Don't screw this up, Rick.

49:49.361 --> 49:51.238
Understand?

49:53.949 --> 49:56.284
See yourself out.

49:56.284 --> 49:59.413
<i>dramatic music</i>

50:16.722 --> 50:18.056
Excuse me.

50:18.056 --> 50:21.184
Are the loan offices
on this floor or the 10th floor?

50:21.184 --> 50:24.187
Well, commercial loans
are on ten, retail's on five.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.605
And on this floor,

50:25.605 --> 50:27.315
it's mostly personal
and home loans, correct?

50:27.315 --> 50:29.568
-  That's correct.
-  Oh. Alright.

50:29.568 --> 50:31.987
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
-  Thank you so much.

50:31.987 --> 50:33.363
And I love your hair.

50:33.363 --> 50:35.157
All of you.

50:35.157 --> 50:36.324
So it's 10th floor.

50:36.324 --> 50:38.243
-  10th floor.
-  Right.

50:39.119 --> 50:42.289
Shall we? 10th floor...

50:45.000 --> 50:46.543
- Oh, the lift is here.
- Ah.

50:46.543 --> 50:49.129
Here we are. 10th floor.

50:50.088 --> 50:55.427
<i>lo-fi heist beats</i>

51:26.041 --> 51:29.377
I'm so sorry. I'm Bridget Mason.

51:29.377 --> 51:31.088
And I'm Raymond Oliver.

51:31.088 --> 51:33.006
We're independent
outside auditors,

51:33.006 --> 51:35.258
and we feel
a bit lost right now.

51:35.258 --> 51:36.676
Is the audit department

51:36.676 --> 51:37.969
on this floor?

51:37.969 --> 51:39.805
Oh, I wonder
how you two wound up here.

51:39.805 --> 51:41.681
Oh, we wondered that ourselves.

51:41.681 --> 51:44.351
Independent auditors are always
given the wrong information.

51:44.351 --> 51:46.019
Oh, well. That is too true.

51:46.019 --> 51:47.229
No, the audit department...

51:49.439 --> 51:51.858
Uh, Rick, I will be
right with you.

51:51.858 --> 51:53.944
Why don't you have
a seat in my office, okay?

51:53.944 --> 51:57.489
Come with me.
I love your gloves, by the way.

51:57.489 --> 51:59.199
Thank you.

52:00.534 --> 52:01.743
Top floor, right?

52:01.743 --> 52:03.787
Yes. You're going to
come right on over here.

52:03.787 --> 52:05.205
Right.

52:50.041 --> 52:51.251
Harriet!

52:51.251 --> 52:53.336
Um...

52:53.336 --> 52:56.673
- 10:00, right?
- Uh, yeah, Rick.

52:56.673 --> 52:58.508

53:34.127 --> 53:35.921

53:36.171 --> 53:40.258

Mr. Horne's working with.

53:40.258 --> 53:44.221
Mr. Horne got
the printouts, but...

53:44.221 --> 53:46.556
- but it's weird.
- Tell him the rest.

53:49.476 --> 53:52.020
The guys that tried
to rob Mr. Horne that night,

53:52.020 --> 53:53.104

53:53.104 --> 53:54.314

53:58.068 --> 53:59.945

53:59.945 --> 54:01.529

54:18.546 --> 54:20.215

55:10.223 --> 55:11.391

55:14.227 --> 55:17.647

and robbing a damn bank!

55:17.647 --> 55:18.982
Lower your voice, son.

55:18.982 --> 55:21.526
This does not look like
commitment to me, Jeremy.

55:21.526 --> 55:24.029
You know, I know
you're going to prison soon,

55:24.029 --> 55:25.363
but with this crew,

55:25.697 --> 55:27.032
you might want to think about

55:27.032 --> 55:28.491
turning yourself in
a little earlier.

55:28.491 --> 55:29.576
Yeah, um, I don't know

55:29.576 --> 55:31.786

55:51.014 --> 55:52.223
I really don't give a damn

55:52.223 --> 55:53.475

55:53.475 --> 55:55.393
I just know that
we leavin' our families,

55:58.188 --> 55:59.981

56:00.440 --> 56:03.902
I have no idea what
your future will be, LaDonna.

56:06.196 --> 56:07.739
But when I was 14
and the teacher said

56:07.739 --> 56:10.992
I was good with numbers,
what was my future?

56:10.992 --> 56:13.244
When I was on the honor roll

56:13.244 --> 56:14.996
and got into the top schools but

56:14.996 --> 56:16.581
we couldn't afford for me to go,

56:16.581 --> 56:19.042
what was my future?

56:19.042 --> 56:20.960
When I fought, scrapped,

56:20.960 --> 56:23.171
and begged my way to get
into Bayer Schaeffer Securities

56:23.171 --> 56:26.758
and became the top trader,
as an intern,

56:26.758 --> 56:29.469
but they didn't want me,

56:29.469 --> 56:30.929
what was my future?

56:30.929 --> 56:32.555
When I knew I could figure out
anything to do

56:32.555 --> 56:36.643
with the movement of capital
anywhere in the world...

56:38.436 --> 56:40.105
what was my future?

56:40.438 --> 56:44.150
I tried to go in the front door
with my gifts, LaDonna.

56:44.150 --> 56:45.276
But the back door is where

56:45.276 --> 56:48.321
the opportunities came
for me to have a future.

56:48.321 --> 56:51.324
Yes, I got caught,

56:51.324 --> 56:52.575
and I'm going to go to prison.

56:52.575 --> 56:56.162
I'm going to do
my prison term because...

56:56.162 --> 56:58.581
I love my family.

56:58.581 --> 57:01.459
Marshall,
you're my brother's son,

57:01.459 --> 57:02.877
and you're my family.

57:02.877 --> 57:05.213
You all are my family now.

57:05.213 --> 57:09.342
And I want you all to have life
the way you want to take it,

57:09.342 --> 57:12.846

and be shat on.

57:13.847 --> 57:15.765

01:21:39.686 --> 01:21:41.062
But a judge will toss out
an indictment

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:43.982
unless he moves the money.

01:21:43.982 --> 01:21:45.609
So what do I do?

01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:48.194
Do everything as planned.

01:21:48.653 --> 01:21:53.825
But we need Horne's words
on tape for a conviction.

01:21:53.825 --> 01:21:55.994
<i>Don't deviate from the plan.</i>

01:21:55.994 --> 01:21:57.162
Are we clear?

01:22:00.123 --> 01:22:01.583
It's me.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:05.420
Yeah, the tape recorder
is going to be under the bed.

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.630
Look.

01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:10.133
I know a lot of Black folks
who are locked up.

01:22:12.802 --> 01:22:14.179
I got it.

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:16.640
<i>The transfer went through.</i>

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:18.391
<i>The funds are
on the way to Geneva.</i>

01:22:18.391 --> 01:22:19.726
Bingo. We have it.

01:22:19.726 --> 01:22:21.186
So if I help you...

01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:22.854
<i>All units, suspects spotted</i>

01:22:22.854 --> 01:22:24.940
<i>at the International Terminal,
gate six.</i>

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.399
Go, go, go.

01:22:29.527 --> 01:22:34.366
...I want a deal for me
and my friends in writing,

01:22:34.824 --> 01:22:37.160
signed by the head
of this office

01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:39.454
and the U.S. Attorney.

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:42.332
Are we clear?

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.334
Alright, guys.
Show me your hands.

01:22:44.334 --> 01:22:45.794
Hands up!

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.170
Show me your hands.

01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:49.172
We're clear.

01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:54.803
We got to cuff you
to make this look real

01:22:58.723 --> 01:23:00.308
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:02.018
His name is Jeremy Horne.

01:23:02.018 --> 01:23:03.728
He was the ring leader.

01:23:03.728 --> 01:23:06.106
We don't have the names
of all those involved

01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:07.941
in the case at this time.

01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:09.275
<i>But what is clear</i>

01:23:09.275 --> 01:23:11.653
<i>is that a plan
was concocted by Horne</i>

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:15.031
to steal $80 million from
First National Bank of Chicago.

01:23:15.031 --> 01:23:17.701
You haven't said
what happened to the money.

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:18.702
<i>Was it returned?</i>

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:20.120
<i>We're working to recover</i>

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:21.246
<i>most of the money.</i>

01:23:21.246 --> 01:23:23.123
You said "most of the money."

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:25.375
Are you saying that
not all of it was recovered?

01:23:25.375 --> 01:23:28.003
Let's say
in the world of money transfers,

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:29.254
<i>it's complicated.</i>

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:30.922
<i>So what else
do you want the public</i>

01:23:30.922 --> 01:23:32.173
<i>to know about this crime?</i>

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:34.175
People have the right to know
what's going on here.

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:36.261
Did Jeremy Horne
show any remorse?

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:37.762
-  <i>Order!</i>

01:23:37.762 --> 01:23:39.723
<i>Order in the court!</i>

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:43.184
<i>Jeremy Horne,
how do you plead?</i>

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:44.936
<i>Your Honor,</i>

01:23:44.936 --> 01:23:47.105
<i>I'm only guilty...</i>

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:48.773
<i>of being caught.</i>

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:53.069
<i>dramatic music</i>
