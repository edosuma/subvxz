10:18.600 --> 10:20.533

the Scotchgard company,

10:43.133 --> 10:46.133

that have the same type
of memories that you have,

11:14.800 --> 11:16.333

and they're shared."

11:16.400 --> 11:18.066

a group of people

11:18.133 --> 11:19.633

19:51.400 --> 19:53.800
I personally think it's memory.

a little bit differently,
