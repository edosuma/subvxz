WEBVTT

00:00.081 --> 00:02.258
A storm is gathering,
and we are at war.

00:06.697 --> 00:09.568
We were your own brothers!

00:09.613 --> 00:11.136
Why are you here?

00:11.179 --> 00:12.659
Because I had a husband

00:12.703 --> 00:14.052
and a baby son.

00:14.095 --> 00:16.315
Your husband
took them away from me.

00:16.359 --> 00:20.232
Isabella. And there will always
be a place for you in this house.

00:20.276 --> 00:21.277
What are you staring at, woman?

00:21.320 --> 00:22.800
Do you not know

00:22.843 --> 00:25.237
that your mistress
is the Princess of Love?

00:28.588 --> 00:31.156
- What is this?
- There have always been rumors

00:31.199 --> 00:33.245
of the Templars worshipping idols.

00:33.289 --> 00:36.161
Tell me, Kelton.
What price are you prepared to pay?

00:40.165 --> 00:42.559
Lay down your weapons
or Landry dies!

00:42.602 --> 00:44.691
- No!
- Landry du Louzon,

00:44.735 --> 00:47.390
traitor to France,
I'm bringing you home.

Filthy scum!

01:35.089 --> 01:37.222
God save the king!

01:37.265 --> 01:38.745
God bless King Philip!

01:46.013 --> 01:48.929
Not so high and almighty now,
are ya?!

01:48.973 --> 01:50.409
We know what you did!

01:50.453 --> 01:52.933
Baby killers!

01:52.977 --> 01:56.546
My people of Paris,
I promised you justice!

01:56.589 --> 01:58.896
Here is your justice!

01:58.939 --> 02:02.203
The shadow of these murderers
and heretics

02:02.247 --> 02:05.685
will never again cast a pall
on the streets of Paris!

02:07.426 --> 02:09.689
The Crusade was not
in the Holy Land this time.

02:09.733 --> 02:11.604
Angus! Angus, no!

02:11.648 --> 02:12.649
Angus!

02:17.393 --> 02:21.048
Get up! I commend you,
my dear brother.

02:21.092 --> 02:22.789
Before almighty God.

02:22.833 --> 02:26.445
I entrust you to your Creator.

02:26.489 --> 02:28.273
May you be returned to He

02:28.316 --> 02:31.363
who formed you from
the dust of the Earth.

02:31.407 --> 02:34.758
Brother, may you return to Him!

02:34.801 --> 02:39.066
This day,
this Friday the 13th of October,

02:39.110 --> 02:41.765
is a day that will be remembered
for all time!

02:41.808 --> 02:45.464
God has used my hand

02:45.508 --> 02:48.293
to cast these Templars out!

03:11.403 --> 03:13.623
Halt!

03:32.555 --> 03:34.426
Leave this one without kindling.

03:34.470 --> 03:35.427
Yes, Sire.

03:40.693 --> 03:43.914
You threw away
the good will of your king...

03:43.957 --> 03:45.481
for this.

His Royal Majesty King Philip.

04:27.261 --> 04:30.134
His Holiness Pope Clement.

04:30.177 --> 04:33.572
Royals, judges,
and you, people of Paris.

04:39.186 --> 04:42.320
The Order known as
the Knights Templar

04:42.363 --> 04:45.149
have been accused of heresy.

04:45.192 --> 04:47.717
They are alleged to have committed

04:47.760 --> 04:52.548
abominable and deranged
acts of sexual impropriety.

04:54.593 --> 04:56.421
And murder!

04:58.554 --> 05:01.644
These are lies!

05:03.994 --> 05:06.997
The king seeks our destruction.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.391
Lies they say?

05:10.435 --> 05:13.656
There has been a thorough
inquiry by the Holy See,

05:13.699 --> 05:16.789
which has led to
the unearthing of evidence

05:16.833 --> 05:18.965
and witness testimony.

05:19.009 --> 05:21.489
What evidence have you?

05:21.533 --> 05:23.753
What testimony?

05:26.277 --> 05:27.713
Bring him in.

05:29.672 --> 05:31.064
This Templar will confirm

05:31.108 --> 05:33.284
what we already know
of your depravity.

05:33.327 --> 05:34.851
He's alive.

05:39.812 --> 05:42.423
Tell us of the
rituals you have engaged in.

05:42.467 --> 05:47.211
Tell us. And unburden
your blackened soul.

05:49.648 --> 05:52.651
I... I engaged in...

05:52.695 --> 05:54.653
Louder!
Let everyone hear.

05:54.697 --> 05:58.396
Kelton, come on. Please.
Don't do this. Don't do this.

06:00.964 --> 06:04.358
I engaged in
inappropriate kissing!

06:07.710 --> 06:09.015
What else?

06:09.059 --> 06:11.496
I...

06:11.539 --> 06:14.368
As part of an initiation ritual,

06:14.412 --> 06:16.675
I denied Christ,

06:16.719 --> 06:19.069
spat on the cross,

06:19.112 --> 06:20.853
worshipped man and demon,

06:20.897 --> 06:23.290
bowed before
a two-faced silver skull.

06:28.600 --> 06:34.432
This evidence was discovered
hidden inside the Paris Temple.

06:34.475 --> 06:36.695
Is this not true, Your Holiness?

06:36.739 --> 06:39.045
These Templars

06:39.089 --> 06:41.265
have engaged in heresy

06:41.308 --> 06:44.616
and must pay for their offenses
against God and man.

06:47.837 --> 06:50.274
For your bravery and honesty

06:50.317 --> 06:52.319
in bringing these offenses to light,

06:52.363 --> 06:55.453
I absolve you,
Kelton Fitz Laval,

06:55.496 --> 06:58.325
of these against God and Church.

07:02.025 --> 07:04.723
You are a free mind.

07:04.767 --> 07:06.812
Now get out of my
sight before I change my mind.

07:20.347 --> 07:23.350
Take them away.

07:23.394 --> 07:24.830
Move out!

07:27.441 --> 07:30.227
Wait, wait.

07:30.270 --> 07:34.013
Margaret. Margaret.

07:34.057 --> 07:36.886
Margaret.

07:36.929 --> 07:40.063
You've said next to nothing
to me since I've been back.

07:40.106 --> 07:42.674
What's happened?

07:42.718 --> 07:45.677
Why is that woman tied up
in the Paris Temple?

07:48.506 --> 07:51.074
Who's Lydia?
You should not be in the Paris Temple.

07:51.117 --> 07:53.685
Who is she?!

07:53.729 --> 07:59.038
Did you... did you kill that
woman's husband and child?

08:02.781 --> 08:05.131
How could you think
I'm capable of such a thing?

08:05.175 --> 08:07.873
Answer me, Louis!
No!

08:07.917 --> 08:09.875
I could never do such a thing!

08:09.919 --> 08:11.877
Then why is she being held
as a prisoner?

08:11.921 --> 08:15.838
Why is she blaming
the murder of her son on you?

08:15.881 --> 08:18.884
Because my father's guards

08:18.928 --> 08:20.799
and Sir Gerard
murdered her husband and son.

08:20.843 --> 08:22.366
Let her go.

08:22.409 --> 08:23.846
Let her go this instance.

08:23.889 --> 08:25.891
The death of her child
and her incarceration

08:25.935 --> 08:27.240
are by royal decree.

08:27.284 --> 08:29.068
Only my father can release her.

08:31.854 --> 08:34.421
Then your father...

08:34.465 --> 08:36.467
is a monster.

08:39.164 --> 08:41.167
You do not understand

08:41.211 --> 08:43.082
the complexities of
ruling a kingdom!

08:43.126 --> 08:46.477
I understand cruelty
when I see it!

08:53.310 --> 08:54.702
Listen.

08:57.401 --> 08:59.664
I was protecting you.

09:07.933 --> 09:11.632
Get out.

09:42.272 --> 09:44.361
- No! No!
- Get off of him!

09:44.404 --> 09:46.276
No, take me! Get back!

09:46.319 --> 09:48.321
Get off him! Get off him!

09:48.365 --> 09:50.628
Rhone! Get off him!

09:50.671 --> 09:53.413
Rhone! Rhone!

09:53.457 --> 09:56.155
Rhone!
- Courage, my brother.

09:58.679 --> 10:01.595
This is fucked!

10:01.639 --> 10:04.120
They broke Kelton!

10:04.163 --> 10:06.209
He never would have
said those things on his own!

10:06.252 --> 10:09.255
Keep yourself together, brother.

10:09.299 --> 10:12.476
There must be a plan.
A strategy.

10:18.699 --> 10:20.919
Landry.

10:20.963 --> 10:23.704
Surely you've... you've been
in a situation like this before?

10:23.748 --> 10:26.925
We must hold fast...

10:26.969 --> 10:30.363
and not give up hope.

10:30.407 --> 10:32.539
God will show us the way.

10:34.237 --> 10:36.065
No.

10:54.735 --> 10:56.563
Jacques DeMolay,

10:56.607 --> 11:00.176
Grandmaster of the Order
of the Knights Templar,

11:00.219 --> 11:03.266
you have been found
guilty of heresy

11:03.309 --> 11:04.920
and will burn at the stake

11:04.963 --> 11:08.488
for your crimes
against Christ our Lord.

11:08.532 --> 11:10.534
Countrymen, listen to me.

11:10.577 --> 11:14.320
These charges are lies!

11:14.364 --> 11:17.410
God knows who the sinners are!

11:17.454 --> 11:19.717
And it is not us.

11:37.735 --> 11:39.650
The Grandmaster is on the stake.

11:49.921 --> 11:53.316
You don't deserve to sit upon
St. Peter's throne.

11:56.014 --> 11:59.409
So says the fallen angel,

11:59.452 --> 12:02.064
a Lucifer,

12:02.107 --> 12:04.457
a blasphemer against God.

12:04.501 --> 12:07.069
You're the Judas.

12:07.112 --> 12:11.334
You have handed over the Church
to the monarchy.

12:11.377 --> 12:13.205
You will rue this day, Raymond.

12:13.249 --> 12:15.555
You will rue this day.

12:18.167 --> 12:21.300
If I'm guilty,

12:21.344 --> 12:25.174
it's because I put my faith in a
man who claimed to be our father

12:25.217 --> 12:27.045
instead of my trusted brothers.

12:29.352 --> 12:34.009
Misfortune will befall you
who have wrongly condemned us.

12:34.052 --> 12:36.489
Hear me now!

12:36.533 --> 12:38.839
God will avenge us!

12:41.712 --> 12:44.062
God will avenge us!

13:21.689 --> 13:25.693
I've always been curious about
the inner workings of the Templar mind.

13:25.737 --> 13:27.303
Now tell me...

13:27.347 --> 13:28.478
The Lord is my Savior.

13:30.002 --> 13:33.135
I will never...
I will never confess.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.094
I don't care about your confession.

13:35.137 --> 13:36.399
I care about the gold.

13:36.443 --> 13:38.184
Where is it?

13:50.675 --> 13:51.850
Tell me where it is.

14:07.169 --> 14:08.170
Murderer!

14:08.214 --> 14:11.086
Heretic!

14:11.130 --> 14:12.392
Murderer!

14:17.702 --> 14:21.140
Pick 'em up.

14:21.183 --> 14:22.358
Tancrede.

14:22.402 --> 14:24.534
It's Tancrede!

14:30.715 --> 14:32.847
Is he alive?

14:32.891 --> 14:34.806
See if he's breathing.

14:38.853 --> 14:41.639
He... he's breathing,
but he's bleeding everywhere.

14:44.511 --> 14:46.252
Oh, no!

14:46.295 --> 14:48.080
Vasant.

14:48.123 --> 14:50.125
Vasant, you need to gather yourself.

14:50.169 --> 14:51.692
Your brother needs you.

14:51.736 --> 14:54.260
His head's been...
His head's been cut open.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.311
Take this.

15:05.097 --> 15:06.838
Wrap it around his wound.

15:06.881 --> 15:09.014
Okay. Okay.

15:12.060 --> 15:14.976
Stay with us, brother.

15:15.020 --> 15:17.152
Stay with us.

15:29.687 --> 15:32.690
Father,
apologies for the interruption,

15:32.733 --> 15:36.476
but it appears
we've been betrayed.

15:39.174 --> 15:41.220
By whom?

15:44.049 --> 15:46.094
This is Camille,

15:46.138 --> 15:47.922
Margaret's lady in waiting.

15:47.966 --> 15:50.446
Tell my father what you saw.

15:54.581 --> 15:56.583
Stop that.

15:56.626 --> 15:58.150
Get out of here at once!

15:58.193 --> 15:59.717
The prince will have your heads for this!

16:06.114 --> 16:07.812
Your Highness.

16:07.855 --> 16:10.510
Please, tell them to stop.
I don't understand.

16:13.774 --> 16:15.210
Look here, Your Highness.

16:15.254 --> 16:17.909
What is that?

16:17.952 --> 16:19.345
That's not mine.

16:23.741 --> 16:26.178
Margaret.

16:26.221 --> 16:30.051
Please, my lord,
I've never seen that before.

16:40.888 --> 16:43.848
I welcome you to my house.

16:43.891 --> 16:46.502
I allow you to sleep in my wife's bed.

16:49.244 --> 16:51.594
You're nothing but a whore.

16:51.638 --> 16:53.379
No.

16:53.422 --> 16:55.207
Please.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.775
Your Highness,
I would never betray you.

16:57.818 --> 16:59.341
I would never betray my husband.

16:59.385 --> 17:02.692
No, please!
This has been a mistake!

17:02.736 --> 17:05.217
There's been a horrible mistake!

17:05.260 --> 17:09.263
A big mistake!
Wait.

17:09.308 --> 17:11.223
Wait!

17:20.406 --> 17:22.800
Open it.

17:34.289 --> 17:35.638
Who goes there?

17:39.338 --> 17:41.470
Are you a Templar?

17:44.430 --> 17:45.866
These are dire times.

17:45.910 --> 17:48.651
We may as well find
solace in each other.

17:48.695 --> 17:52.307
There is no solace.

17:52.351 --> 17:55.615
Only pain.

17:55.658 --> 17:59.053
Do I know you, brother?

17:59.097 --> 18:01.055
If you did...

18:01.099 --> 18:03.449
you wouldn't call me that.

18:31.890 --> 18:34.066
Stop, please.

18:34.110 --> 18:36.286
No!

18:40.377 --> 18:44.294
No! Get off!

18:46.861 --> 18:48.820
No!

19:16.891 --> 19:19.372
Camille, Astrid,

19:19.416 --> 19:21.853
you know me.

19:21.896 --> 19:24.377
Camille, Astrid.

19:24.421 --> 19:26.988
I'm innocent.

19:27.032 --> 19:29.948
Get Prince Louis.
He'll tell you.

19:29.991 --> 19:32.124
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait.

19:36.563 --> 19:39.131
Wait.

19:39.175 --> 19:42.656
Louis!

19:42.700 --> 19:44.484
Louis!

19:44.528 --> 19:46.182
Louis!

20:01.110 --> 20:04.069
Traitor!
You killed Berenger!

20:04.113 --> 20:06.898
If it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be in here!

20:06.941 --> 20:08.334
Yet here we are.

20:08.378 --> 20:11.859
Ignore him.
He is a spy for the king.

20:11.903 --> 20:13.687
I'm no spy, Landry.

20:13.731 --> 20:17.474
- Just a man of foolish pride.
- If you're no spy,

20:17.517 --> 20:20.303
then why is the king's marshal
in here with us?

20:20.346 --> 20:25.525
Because the path I was taking
became untenable.

20:25.569 --> 20:27.048
Search the Temple for my gold.

20:27.092 --> 20:29.181
I'll go, Your Majesty.

20:29.225 --> 20:33.359
I'm familiar with these temples.

20:33.403 --> 20:35.448
He sent me to look for his gold.

20:47.199 --> 20:49.114
I found her, Landry.

20:49.158 --> 20:51.899
- What are you doing here?
- Please don't hurt her.

20:51.943 --> 20:53.336
Please don't harm this child.

20:53.379 --> 20:54.815
What interest would I have
in an infant?

20:54.859 --> 20:56.643
I don't know.

20:56.687 --> 20:59.168
I don't know why anyone
would want to kill a child,

20:59.211 --> 21:01.561
least of all the Prince of France.

21:01.605 --> 21:04.260
What do you mean,
the Prince of France?

21:04.303 --> 21:08.438
Prince Louis tried to kill us
and this child.

21:08.481 --> 21:10.918
There was two other men
there who saved us.

21:10.962 --> 21:12.790
They shot Prince Louis
with a crossbow.

21:17.925 --> 21:19.188
Where was the prince wounded?

21:22.278 --> 21:25.846
I beg you,
spare the life of this child.

21:29.546 --> 21:31.156
Whose child is this?

21:33.550 --> 21:35.247
I found your child.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.249
No. Wait, wait.

21:37.293 --> 21:38.946
Take me as a prisoner
if you wish.

21:38.990 --> 21:40.426
Let her leave with the child.

21:40.470 --> 21:42.080
The king and prince
will surely kill her.

21:42.123 --> 21:43.951
Please, she's just an innocent.

21:51.132 --> 21:54.397
I helped them escape.

21:57.922 --> 21:59.619
Go down the stairs.

21:59.663 --> 22:01.360
On the left, there is a door
that leads to the stables.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.493
When you are sure
no one is watching,

22:03.536 --> 22:04.885
leave through a breech in the wall.

22:04.929 --> 22:06.322
Now go!

22:09.847 --> 22:12.153
I tried to kill the king.

22:14.808 --> 22:17.158
Your timing is excellent.

22:17.202 --> 22:21.946
Will the marshal care
to extract his pound of flesh?

22:21.989 --> 22:23.295
How about two.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.473
You swore a blood oath to me!

22:27.517 --> 22:29.432
And blood I shall have!

22:38.832 --> 22:40.181
Aah!

22:45.361 --> 22:47.058
Guards!

22:58.809 --> 23:00.376
Put him on that table.

23:04.380 --> 23:07.774
Louis.

23:07.818 --> 23:09.428
Take it off him.

23:18.002 --> 23:22.528
We've won.
You finally have glory.

23:22.572 --> 23:26.315
There is no glory in the killing
of innocent children!

23:28.795 --> 23:30.275
To glory, then.

23:36.847 --> 23:40.633
He's telling the truth.

23:40.677 --> 23:42.940
I witnessed it all.

23:45.203 --> 23:47.248
I saw it all.

23:47.292 --> 23:49.512
You know what this means?

23:49.555 --> 23:52.602
Eve and Anne...

23:52.645 --> 23:54.908
They're safe.

24:14.898 --> 24:16.552
Hello, Margaret.

24:16.595 --> 24:18.249
Isabella.

24:20.556 --> 24:23.994
Please, help me.

24:24.037 --> 24:25.474
There's been a mistake.

24:25.517 --> 24:27.650
I would...

24:27.693 --> 24:29.652
I would never betray Louis.

24:29.695 --> 24:31.262
You know that.

24:31.306 --> 24:34.309
I love him,

24:34.352 --> 24:36.224
more than anything.

24:36.267 --> 24:40.228
Please.

24:40.271 --> 24:43.535
Isabella, you asked me
to keep your secrets,

24:43.579 --> 24:46.538
but now you must share them
to set me free.

24:46.582 --> 24:48.627
Why would I set you free

24:48.671 --> 24:52.414
when I worked so hard
to put you here?

24:57.158 --> 24:58.333
But we're sisters.

24:58.376 --> 25:02.554
I only have brothers.

25:02.598 --> 25:05.949
I've never seen Louis cry before,

25:05.992 --> 25:08.691
but when he learned
what you'd done,

25:08.734 --> 25:13.348
how you betrayed him by
lying with those men. No.

25:13.391 --> 25:15.698
I could see his heart break.

25:15.741 --> 25:17.003
No!

25:19.136 --> 25:21.921
How can you be so cruel?!

25:21.965 --> 25:23.923
What did I ever do to you?!

25:23.967 --> 25:26.056
You forgot your place.

25:26.099 --> 25:29.668
Days after my mother died,
you took her rooms.

25:29.712 --> 25:31.714
Louis gave them to me.
Then presumed to tell me

25:31.757 --> 25:34.804
that I'd always be welcome
in my own home.

25:34.847 --> 25:36.458
I only meant to comfort you.

25:36.501 --> 25:39.548
No, you meant to patronize.

25:39.591 --> 25:43.900
Isabella, I'm sorry.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.989
I'm so very sorry.

26:05.835 --> 26:09.534
I told you,
Margaret of Burgundy...

26:09.578 --> 26:13.799
France was not kind to queens.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.406
I'm sorry.

26:55.450 --> 26:58.670
I... I... I...

27:07.331 --> 27:09.681
Please...

27:12.684 --> 27:15.557
Please forgive me.

27:23.478 --> 27:25.436
Oh, God.

27:27.395 --> 27:29.353
Beautiful, isn't she?

27:29.397 --> 27:32.748
I'm calling her the Iron Maiden.

27:32.791 --> 27:35.620
From here on...

27:35.664 --> 27:37.318
she's the only love
you'll ever know.

27:39.972 --> 27:42.932
At this length,
the spikes will cause

27:42.975 --> 27:45.456
an unpleasant pressure
on your skin.

27:45.500 --> 27:46.762
Superficial.

27:49.025 --> 27:53.116
Here, they'll pierce your skin
and you'll bleed.

27:55.771 --> 27:59.862
Now, they'll pierce your gut,

27:59.905 --> 28:03.039
your bones,

28:03.082 --> 28:05.346
and finally...

28:09.306 --> 28:11.526
...your heart.

28:11.569 --> 28:13.615
Louis.

28:13.658 --> 28:15.007
It would break your mother

28:15.051 --> 28:17.009
to know how much
you've forgotten her.

28:17.053 --> 28:18.576
Silence.

28:20.752 --> 28:24.713
Do not speak of my mother.

28:24.756 --> 28:28.412
Your father... he made me watch

28:28.456 --> 28:30.327
as he stabbed her in her pregnant belly.

28:30.371 --> 28:31.372
Enough!

28:34.810 --> 28:36.289
Louis!

28:41.730 --> 28:44.428
He didn't even bury her, Louis.

28:44.472 --> 28:45.603
I did.

28:45.647 --> 28:47.213
Shut up. So that...

28:47.257 --> 28:49.999
Shut up!
She wouldn't rot in the forest.

28:50.042 --> 28:51.522
Your father...

28:51.566 --> 28:54.482
He's made you hunt

28:54.525 --> 28:56.527
and kill your half-sister.

29:05.188 --> 29:07.190
Louis! Louis!

29:07.233 --> 29:08.409
Enough!

29:08.452 --> 29:10.236
Enough! Enough!

29:10.280 --> 29:13.022
You've done enough.

29:29.908 --> 29:33.521
You know,
I was never supposed to be king.

29:33.564 --> 29:36.306
My older brother Louis
was next in line.

29:39.352 --> 29:42.007
I loved my brother.

29:42.051 --> 29:43.792
He taught me to hunt,

29:43.835 --> 29:45.489
and he protected me
and my younger brother Charles

29:45.533 --> 29:48.318
from my father's wrath.

29:48.361 --> 29:52.235
I loved him so much I named
my first-born son after him.

29:52.278 --> 29:56.457
When my mother died,
I was only a child.

29:56.500 --> 30:00.156
But after Charles passed
and then my brother Louis...

30:02.506 --> 30:04.987
...the family I loved
more than anything was gone.

30:08.251 --> 30:11.733
You and I... we weren't born
under the same conditions.

30:15.737 --> 30:19.001
But I once regarded you just
as I regarded my brother Louis.

30:23.658 --> 30:26.791
But you destroyed that
when you took her from me.

30:26.835 --> 30:30.665
I couldn't take...

30:30.708 --> 30:33.189
what you already lost.

31:01.807 --> 31:03.330
Margaret?!

31:11.730 --> 31:13.036
Camille, what happened?

31:15.603 --> 31:18.041
Where's Margaret?

31:18.084 --> 31:20.130
They took her.

31:20.173 --> 31:24.351
Who took her?

31:24.395 --> 31:26.745
Where is my wife?

31:49.942 --> 31:52.205
Welcome back.

31:54.164 --> 31:56.557
Beg me.

31:56.601 --> 31:58.733
Beg me for your life.

32:00.387 --> 32:03.564
You have...

32:03.608 --> 32:05.653
nothing in your hands.

32:10.136 --> 32:13.661
God controls my life...

32:13.705 --> 32:15.446
not you.

32:19.667 --> 32:21.539
This is not the end.

32:48.131 --> 32:49.393
That's right.

32:49.436 --> 32:51.090
It isn't.

32:51.134 --> 32:54.006
You're going to watch
your brothers die,

32:54.049 --> 32:58.184
and only then,
when it's just you,

32:58.228 --> 32:59.794
am I going to kill you.

33:08.325 --> 33:11.806
Out of my way.

33:11.850 --> 33:15.897
Out of my way or I'll kill you
where you stand.

33:15.941 --> 33:19.727
Your father ordered us
not to let you in, Your Grace.

33:22.687 --> 33:24.210
Pardon us, Your Grace,
but we don't have the key.

33:24.254 --> 33:25.385
Only your father does.

33:28.954 --> 33:30.738
Margaret!

33:30.782 --> 33:32.218
Margaret!

33:32.262 --> 33:34.916
Father,
why have you imprisoned her?!

33:34.960 --> 33:37.528
You will free Margaret at once!

33:48.408 --> 33:50.758
Will?

33:50.802 --> 33:53.370
Your wife is where she belongs.

33:53.413 --> 33:55.937
What?

33:55.981 --> 33:58.853
She was witnessed with
two men in her bed.

34:03.336 --> 34:05.338
At the same time.

34:05.382 --> 34:08.210
Neither of whom was you.

34:10.300 --> 34:12.302
Impossible.

34:12.344 --> 34:15.696
It appears you and I now share
the unpleasant distinction

34:15.739 --> 34:19.004
of being cuckolded by our wives.

34:19.047 --> 34:21.311
Be grateful I didn't behead her.

34:21.353 --> 34:24.313
Margaret wouldn't do such a thing.

34:26.620 --> 34:29.188
Louis, I warned you about her.

34:29.232 --> 34:32.364
About producing an heir.

34:32.409 --> 34:37.327
Would you prefer
she carry another's?

34:37.370 --> 34:39.851
I'm just sorry you had to
learn the hard truth.

34:42.114 --> 34:45.335
But women are all alike.

34:45.378 --> 34:48.728
Eventually...

34:48.773 --> 34:50.688
they betray you.

35:06.399 --> 35:07.748
Father, at least let me see her.

35:07.792 --> 35:09.924
Absolutely not.

35:09.968 --> 35:12.623
Your marriage will be annulled,
and you will have a new wife.

35:12.666 --> 35:14.799
Margaret was your mother's choice.

35:14.842 --> 35:17.105
I'll choose more carefully this time.

35:17.149 --> 35:19.499
Margaret is my wife

35:19.543 --> 35:24.417
and will remain as such
until I decide!

35:24.461 --> 35:26.637
Not you.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.509
Now give me the key.

35:36.429 --> 35:38.692
You insolent boy.

35:38.736 --> 35:41.347
I am your king.

35:41.391 --> 35:43.697
Everything you have,
the air you breathe,

35:43.741 --> 35:45.960
the woman you fuck
is because of me,

35:46.004 --> 35:47.701
because I allow it.

35:47.745 --> 35:49.399
Don't be a fool and think

35:49.442 --> 35:51.749
I can't take everything away
from you if I see fit.

35:56.536 --> 35:59.844
You will never return to
Margaret's tower again.

35:59.887 --> 36:02.977
Defy me, and I promise

36:03.021 --> 36:06.590
I will punish you more severely
next time.

36:20.987 --> 36:23.642
God has abandoned us.

36:23.686 --> 36:26.689
Talus would remind us to choose faith.

36:28.734 --> 36:30.910
God is with us, and when we die,

36:30.954 --> 36:35.349
we will be reunited with Him
in Paradise.

36:47.927 --> 36:51.017
Let's pray.

36:51.061 --> 36:52.497
Tancrede.

36:54.717 --> 36:56.588
Ulric.

37:04.770 --> 37:06.337
Vasant.

37:13.736 --> 37:15.781
Gawain.

37:22.005 --> 37:25.661
Lord...

37:25.704 --> 37:27.793
we pray to You for hope.

37:27.837 --> 37:34.321
Hope that we may find relief
from our pain,

37:34.365 --> 37:40.588
and that our souls will find
a way into Your gentle arms.

37:40.632 --> 37:43.417
Please, God, show us Your mercy

37:43.461 --> 37:46.594
and grant us Your salvation

37:46.638 --> 37:48.727
and Your everlasting peace.

37:48.771 --> 37:51.034
Our Father...

37:51.077 --> 37:55.603
...who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name...

37:55.647 --> 37:57.562
Thy kingdom come,

37:57.605 --> 38:01.740
Thy will be done on
Earth as in heaven.

38:01.784 --> 38:05.265
Give us this day
our daily bread.

38:05.309 --> 38:08.355
Forgive us our trespasses,

38:08.399 --> 38:12.403
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

38:12.446 --> 38:15.754
and lead us not into temptation,

38:15.798 --> 38:17.713
but deliver us from evil

38:17.756 --> 38:21.978
for Thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory

38:22.021 --> 38:25.459
forever and ever, amen.
- Amen.

38:32.336 --> 38:34.251
It was you.

38:36.035 --> 38:38.777
You put Margaret in that tower.

39:59.858 --> 40:02.121
Wait, wait, stop!

40:02.165 --> 40:04.080
Please stop!
I recant!

40:04.123 --> 40:07.431
I recant my testimony!

40:07.474 --> 40:10.216
Get off me!
The king's men tortured me!

40:10.260 --> 40:11.870
They demanded
I confess to these lies!

40:11.914 --> 40:14.264
Get off me!
They're innocent!

40:14.307 --> 40:17.528
Please, please, they're
righteous soldiers of Christ!

40:17.571 --> 40:20.313
This is not justice!
Brothers.

40:20.357 --> 40:22.402
Your Majesty?

40:22.446 --> 40:27.146
Parisians, this man has lied
to your king,

40:27.190 --> 40:31.150
to your Pope.

40:31.194 --> 40:33.979
Most of all...

40:34.023 --> 40:36.155
he has lied to you.

40:36.199 --> 40:39.811
No, I didn't.

40:39.855 --> 40:43.423
We cannot let this man
go unpunished, can we?

40:43.467 --> 40:47.340
No!

40:47.384 --> 40:50.082
Will you be the hand of justice?

40:50.126 --> 40:52.128
This is not justice!

40:52.171 --> 40:54.173
- Leave him alone!
- Will you spill his blood?!

40:54.217 --> 40:57.350
- Yes!
- No! No!

40:57.394 --> 40:58.917
Then take him.

41:01.485 --> 41:04.401
Don't do this!
Don't do this!

41:04.444 --> 41:06.272
Please don't do this!

41:06.316 --> 41:09.972
Pluck his eyes out!

41:15.238 --> 41:16.979
Kelton!

41:33.038 --> 41:35.388

for your stake myself.

41:38.043 --> 41:42.352
God will have His revenge
on you.

41:42.395 --> 41:44.789
Perhaps.

43:19.275 --> 43:21.886
Father...

43:21.929 --> 43:24.932
into Your arms
I commend my spirit.
