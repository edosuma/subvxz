WEBVTT

00:23.120 --> 00:24.189
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:24.190 --> 00:25.179
>> WE WERE CALLED BY THE GIRL'S

00:25.190 --> 00:26.259
MOTHER.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.284
>> SHE'S A VERY IMPORTANT CLIENT

00:27.290 --> 00:28.211
OF OURS. SHE'S ASKED US TO

00:28.220 --> 00:29.187
TRANSFER HER DAUGHTER TO OUR

00:29.190 --> 00:30.122
OFFICE.

00:30.130 --> 00:30.824
>> WE HAVE A PRIVATE AMBULANCE

00:30.830 --> 00:34.823
OUT FRONT.

00:34.830 --> 00:36.161
>> WHICH GIRL?

00:36.170 --> 00:37.091
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHICH GIRL?

00:37.100 --> 00:37.828
THE ONE WHO WAS A'ITACKED BY THE

00:37.830 --> 00:38.592
CARVER.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.589
>> YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE A

00:39.600 --> 00:41.238
LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC. I HAVE

00:41.240 --> 00:43.504
9 VICTIMS.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.615
>> HE A'I'I'ACKED ALL THESE GIRLS

00:57.620 --> 00:59.110
TONIGHT?

00:59.120 --> 01:02.123
>> PICKED THEM OFF ONE BY ONE.

01:02.130 --> 01:02.789
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS IS A

01:02.790 --> 01:03.620
GOOD THING.

01:03.630 --> 01:04.619
>> I THINK YOU'RE BECOMING

01:04.630 --> 01:06.222
DESENSITIZED, KIT.

01:06.230 --> 01:07.356
>> SERIAL CRIMINALS LIKE THE

01:07.360 --> 01:08.759
CARVER ARE CREATURES OF HABIT.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.227
THEY'RE OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE.

01:10.230 --> 01:11.822
WHEN THEY BREAK PROTOCOL LIKE

01:11.830 --> 01:12.899
THIS, IT MEANS THEY'RE GE'I'I'ING

01:12.900 --> 01:14.492
DESPERATE. THAT'S WHEN WE CATCH

01:14.500 --> 01:17.162
THEM. IT'S ALWAYS DARKEST BEFORE

01:17.170 --> 01:18.706
THE DAWN.

01:18.710 --> 01:22.305
>> WHERE'S CHELSEY MYERS?

01:22.310 --> 01:23.675
WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK TO

01:23.680 --> 01:25.147
CHELSEY? I'M GOING TO SEE IF I

01:25.150 --> 01:25.900
CAN HELP ANY OF THESE OTHER

01:25.910 --> 01:27.571
GIRLS.

01:41.630 --> 01:46.397
>> CHELSEY?

01:46.400 --> 01:47.560
CHELSEY, MY NAME IS DR.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.208
CHRISTIAN TROY. I'M A PLASTIC

01:49.210 --> 01:51.701
SURGEON. YOUR MOM CALLED ME AND

01:51.710 --> 01:53.268
ASKED ME TO COME DOWN HERE AND

01:53.280 --> 01:54.804
TAKE CARE OF YOU. SHE'S GONNA

01:54.810 --> 01:56.903
MEET US AT MY OFFICE. SHE'S NOT

01:56.910 --> 02:00.277
ALLOWED IN HERE RIGHT NOW.

02:00.280 --> 02:04.819
>> MY MOM IS HERE?

02:04.820 --> 02:05.809
>> I'M GONNA TAKE GOOD CARE OF

02:05.820 --> 02:08.482
YOU, SWEETHEART, OK? SHE'S IN

02:08.490 --> 02:10.958
SHOCK.

02:10.960 --> 02:11.949
>> I'D LIKE TO TAKE A COUPLE OF

02:11.960 --> 02:12.927
THESE GIRLS BACK TO THE OFFICE

02:12.930 --> 02:14.591
FOR SURGERY. IT'LL BE A LATE

02:14.600 --> 02:15.692
NIGHT, BUT MAYBE WE CAN DO THEM

02:15.700 --> 02:16.769
BACK TO BACK.

02:16.770 --> 02:17.566
>> OK.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.231
>> CHELSEY, CAN YOU TELL ME

02:19.240 --> 02:19.968
ANYTHING YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THE

02:19.970 --> 02:21.369
MAN WHO ATTACKED YOU?

02:21.370 --> 02:22.359
>> KIT, NOW'S NOT THE TIME.

02:22.370 --> 02:23.200
>> IT'S THE BEST TIME,

02:23.210 --> 02:24.700
CHRISTIAN. WE HAVE TO CATCH THIS

02:24.710 --> 02:25.904
MAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS

02:25.910 --> 02:26.877
GOING TO LOOK LIKE A DISNEY

02:26.880 --> 02:27.835
MOVIE COMPARED TO WHAT HE'S

02:27.840 --> 02:33.517
GONNA DO NEXT.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.544
>> HE MUST'VE CLIMBED IN THROUGH

02:34.550 --> 02:38.748
THE WINDOW. FIRE ESCAPE. HE MADE

02:38.750 --> 02:40.308
HIS WAY DOWN THE HALL, FROM

02:40.320 --> 02:42.880
ROOM TO ROOM.

02:42.890 --> 02:43.925
I WALKED IN ON HIM WHEN HE WAS

02:43.930 --> 02:47.593
RAPING ELLEN.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.726
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.

02:48.730 --> 02:50.425
I JUST RAN TOWARDS THEM AND

02:50.430 --> 02:52.534
JUMPED ON HIM.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.495
>> YOU'RE A VERY BRAVE GIRL,

02:53.500 --> 02:55.331
CH ELSEY.

02:55.340 --> 02:57.865
>> WELL, IT DIDN'T DO ANY GOOD.

02:57.870 --> 02:59.337
HE JUST TOSSED ME ASIDE LIKE I

02:59.340 --> 03:01.808
WAS A DOLL.

03:01.810 --> 03:04.347
AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW IT.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.601
> > SAW WHAT?

03:05.610 --> 03:06.611
>> HIS PANTS WERE DOWN WHEN HE

03:06.620 --> 03:10.442
TURNED TOWARDS ME AND I SAW IT.

03:10.450 --> 03:12.850
> > HIS PENIS?

03:12.860 --> 03:16.785
>> NO...IT WASN'T A PENIS. IT

03:16.790 --> 03:19.623
WAS ONE OF THOSE FAKE STRAP-ON

03:19.630 --> 03:20.790
THINGS.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.639
>> MIAMI POLICE! WE ARE ARMED!

03:29.640 --> 03:31.437
SURRENDER YOURSELF IMMEDIATELY!

04:58.890 --> 05:00.528
>> I'M AFRAID DOING ANY WORK ON

05:00.530 --> 05:01.827
YOUR SCARS WOULD BE LESS THAN

05:01.830 --> 05:03.593
PRUDENT FOR US AT THIS POINT,

05:03.600 --> 05:06.364
QUENTIN, BUT WE CAN REFER YOU TO

05:06.370 --> 05:07.394
DR. SACHS.

05:11.710 --> 05:16.579
>> A REFERRAL?

05:16.580 --> 05:19.003
WHO ELSE BESIDES THE TWO OF YOU

05:19.010 --> 05:21.740
UNDERSTANDS ON A DEEPER LEVEL

05:21.750 --> 05:22.648
WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO MAKE ME

05:22.650 --> 05:26.450
WHOLE AGAIN?

05:26.460 --> 05:27.757
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.819
>> OBVIOUSLY, WE UNDERSTAND

05:29.830 --> 05:32.458
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH AND WE

05:32.460 --> 05:33.028
SYM PATHIZE, BUT--

05:33.030 --> 05:34.622
>> IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T WANT

05:34.630 --> 05:35.790
TO HELP YOU, QUENTIN. IT'S JUST

05:35.800 --> 05:36.698
TOO DANGEROUS FOR US TO DO THE

05:36.700 --> 05:37.724
WORK.

05:37.730 --> 05:38.662
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DANGEROUS?

05:38.670 --> 05:40.490
>> THE CARVER ONLY CAME AFTER US

05:40.500 --> 05:41.899
BECAUSE WE FIXED HIS VICTIMS.

05:41.900 --> 05:42.832
>> AND THEN HE WENT AFTER MY

05:42.840 --> 05:44.762
FIANCEE.

05:44.770 --> 05:45.839
REPAIRING YOUR FACE WOULD BE

05:45.840 --> 05:48.479
TOO DANGEROUS FOR US. WE'RE NOT

05:48.480 --> 05:49.572
WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK

05:49.580 --> 05:50.649
ANYMORE.

05:50.650 --> 05:53.141
>> OH. YOU MEAN IN THE SAME WAY

05:53.150 --> 05:54.708
I PUT MYSELF IN DANGER WHEN I

05:54.720 --> 05:56.449
FIXED YOUR FACE, SEAN? WHAT

05:56.450 --> 05:57.485
ABOUT THE HALF DOZEN SORORITY

05:57.490 --> 05:58.514
GIRLS BOTH OF YOU FIXED LAST

05:58.520 --> 06:02.524
NIGHT? THAT TAKES CARE OF YOUR

06:02.530 --> 06:05.454
DANGER THEORY, DOESN'T IT? WHY

06:05.460 --> 06:07.553
DON'T YOU TWO JUST PLEASE ADMIT

06:07.560 --> 06:08.788
WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT? YOU

06:08.800 --> 06:10.665
JUST DON'T LIKE ME. YOU NEVER

06:10.670 --> 06:12.695
HAVE. YOU NEVER GAVE ME THE

06:12.700 --> 06:13.564
CHANCE.

06:13.570 --> 06:14.559
>> WE DID GIVE YOU A CHANCE. YOU

06:14.570 --> 06:15.798
BLEW IT BY CONSISTENTLY BEING

06:15.800 --> 06:17.802
DECEPTIVE.

06:18.810 --> 06:19.674
>> THE DRUG USE.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.669
>> DATING MY EX-WIFE.

06:20.680 --> 06:21.738
>> SCREWING A MALE PATIENT IN

06:21.740 --> 06:23.139
RECOVERY.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.105
>> THE DRUGS WERE A ONE-TIME

06:24.110 --> 06:27.568
THING. DATING JULIA, THAT JUST

06:30.550 --> 06:32.711
IS CONCERNED, IT WAS A MISTAKE.

06:32.720 --> 06:33.755
>> PRETENDING TO BE A GIGOLO

06:33.760 --> 06:34.715
WHEN YOU HAVEN'T EVEN GOT A

06:34.720 --> 06:35.584
DICK--

06:35.590 --> 06:36.682
>> SO IF I TOLD YOU THAT I WAS

06:36.690 --> 06:37.850
BORN WITHOUT A PENIS, THAT

06:37.860 --> 06:38.884
WOULD'VE MADE EVERYTHING OK,

06:38.890 --> 06:39.697
RIGHT?

06:39.700 --> 06:41.895
>> YOU MEAN SOME TWINK DIDN'T

06:41.900 --> 06:42.924
BITE IT OFF DURING A LOVER'S

06:42.930 --> 06:47.560
SPAT?

06:47.570 --> 06:52.837
>> [SIGHS] I WAS BORN WITH WHAT

06:52.840 --> 06:54.705
IS CALLED A 5-ALPHA REDUCT ASE

06:54.710 --> 06:59.773
DEFICIENCY. IT'S A GENETIC

06:59.780 --> 07:02.840
DISORDER THAT HAPPENS IN UTERO.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.147
I SPENT MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD IN

07:04.150 --> 07:05.708
AND OUT OF HOSPITALS, UNDERGOING

07:05.720 --> 07:07.119
HORMONE THERAPIES AND

07:07.120 --> 07:12.126
RECONSTRUCT IVE SURGERIES IN

07:12.130 --> 07:13.597
ORDER TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.589
THAT MADE ME WANT TO BECOME A

07:14.600 --> 07:15.726
SURGEON.

07:15.730 --> 07:16.765
>> WHAT ABOUT THAT COLLEGE PARTY

07:16.770 --> 07:18.920
WE WENT TO? I SAW YOU GET A BLOW

07:18.930 --> 07:19.794
JOB.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.734
>> SHE WAS DRUNK, SEAN. I

07:21.740 --> 07:23.139
OFFERED HER 100 BUCKS TO PRETEND

07:23.140 --> 07:25.506
I HAD ONE. SHE DIDN'T CARE.

07:25.510 --> 07:26.260
>> WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

07:26.270 --> 07:27.737
>> BECAUSE I WANTED TO FEEL LIKE

07:27.740 --> 07:30.971
ONE OF THE BOYS FOR ONCE!

07:30.980 --> 07:33.813
BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE ACCEPTED.

07:33.820 --> 07:34.741
>> IS THAT WHY YOU GRABBED MY

07:34.750 --> 07:35.910
ASS IN BED WITH KIT? BECAUSE YOU

07:35.920 --> 07:37.285
WANTED TO BE ACCEPTED?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.611
>> I KNEW THAT IF SHE TOOK IT

07:39.620 --> 07:41.156
ANY FURTHER, THAT IF I TOOK IT

07:41.160 --> 07:42.650
ANY FURTHER, SHE WOULD DISCOVER

07:42.660 --> 07:44.218
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A DICK AND

07:44.230 --> 07:47.119
THAT WOULD RUIN EVERYTHING.

07:47.130 --> 07:51.863
AT LEAST BY GRABBING YOUR ASS...

07:51.870 --> 07:53.599
I GOT TO KEEP MY SECRET.

07:57.770 --> 08:01.069
I ADMIRE YOU BOTH. THAT'S WHY I

08:01.080 --> 08:03.071
TOOK THE JOB. BUT MORE THAN

08:03.080 --> 08:05.048
THAT, I JUST--I WANTED TO BE

08:05.050 --> 08:08.645
LIKE YOU. YOU KNOW, FOR THE

08:08.650 --> 08:10.914
FIRST TIME, IT'S FUNNY, ALL

08:10.920 --> 08:11.841
3 OF US HAVE SOMETHING IN

08:11.850 --> 08:14.785
COMMON. WE'VE ALL BEEN CARVED.

08:20.330 --> 08:21.854
YET YOU STILL CAN'T TREAT ME

08:21.860 --> 08:22.827
LIKE AN EQUAL.

08:28.340 --> 08:32.003
> > WAIT.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.173
HOW'S THURSDAY FOR YOU?

08:45.350 --> 08:47.056
>> I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THE

08:47.060 --> 08:49.210
MALL, MA'I'I'. YOU KNOW, I WAS

08:49.220 --> 08:51.927
JEALOUS. I'M HUMAN.

08:51.930 --> 08:55.798
>> YEAH, I KNOW. I HEAR YOU.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.019
BUT IT'S STILL OVER BETWEEN US.

08:59.030 --> 09:02.158
>> LISTEN, I JUST WANT TO KNOW.

09:02.170 --> 09:03.159
WHAT DOES CHERRY HAVE THAT I

09:03.170 --> 09:04.728
DON'T HAVE?

09:04.740 --> 09:07.709
>> [SIGHS] SEE, THIS IS WHY I

09:07.710 --> 09:09.769
DIDN'T WANT TO GET IN THE CAR.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.145
YOU'RE IRRATIONAL AND YOU DON'T

09:11.150 --> 09:14.142
LISTEN, ARIEL. THERE'S NOTHING

09:14.150 --> 09:15.879
BETWEEN ME AND CHERRY.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.179
>> I JUST WANT TO KNOW. I MEAN,

09:19.190 --> 09:21.078
DOES CHERRY HAVE A PENIS?

09:21.090 --> 09:24.082
>> JESUS, ARIEL! THIS IS INSANE.

09:24.090 --> 09:25.159
>> NO, JUST TELL ME. I JUST WANT

09:25.160 --> 09:27.799
TO KNOW. IT DOESN'T SCARE ME.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.689
JUST TELL ME. YOU KNOW, IF WEIRD

09:30.700 --> 09:32.736
SEX IS WHAT YOU WANT, I'M

09:32.740 --> 09:34.093
TOTALLY FOR THAT. YOU JUST--YOU

09:34.100 --> 09:36.239
JUST DIDN'T GIVE ME A CHANCE.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.367
PLEASE, MATI'.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.871
>> OK.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.131
>> NO, MA'I'I', PLEASE!

09:41.140 --> 09:43.802
>> LISTEN, ARIEL. SETTLE DOWN.

09:43.810 --> 09:46.301
>> YOU HEARD THE MAN, ARIEL. GET

09:46.310 --> 09:50.713
OFF HIM.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.641
SLIDE OVER, MATT.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.692
>> UM, WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:59.700 --> 10:02.294
>> A LITTLE OUTING. JUST US.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.029
>> I DID WHAT YOU SAID, DADDY.

10:04.030 --> 10:05.793
I KEPT HIM HERE.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.028
>> SEAT BELTS, EVERYONE.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.440
>> LASAGNA. WOW.

10:18.450 --> 10:20.111
>> RESERVE JUDGMENT 'TILL YOU'VE

10:20.120 --> 10:22.213
TRIED IT. I'VE HAD A LOT OF TIME

10:22.220 --> 10:24.188
TO CULTIVATE MY CULINARY SKILLS

10:24.190 --> 10:26.909
LIVING ON MY OWN. I THINK THAT'S

10:26.920 --> 10:29.787
BEEN ABOUT THE ONLY ADVANTAGE.

10:29.790 --> 10:30.984
>> I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GO

10:30.990 --> 10:32.127
OVER SOME CHANGES IN THE

10:32.130 --> 10:33.051
MORTGAGE.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.221
>> AFTER DINNER. EAT. IT FEELS

10:35.230 --> 10:36.891
LIKE YEARS SINCE WE'VE SAT HERE

10:36.900 --> 10:38.720
AND HAD A MEAL TOGETHER.

10:38.730 --> 10:43.736
>> THIS IS REALLY SWEET OF YOU.

10:43.740 --> 10:46.971
WHAT'S THIS?

10:46.980 --> 10:50.108
> > OPEN IT.

10:50.110 --> 10:52.146
>> IT'S THE DEED TO OUR HOUSE.

10:52.150 --> 10:58.714
>> YEAH. I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.051
I MADE THE LAST MORTGAGE PAYMENT

11:00.060 --> 11:01.459
ON IT YESTERDAY. IT'S OFFICIALLY

11:01.460 --> 11:04.827
OURS.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.721
BUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOURS.

11:08.730 --> 11:11.824
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

11:11.830 --> 11:13.491
>> YOU MADE THIS HOUSE, JULIA.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.990
YOU PICKED THE PAINT, THE

11:15.000 --> 11:16.297
MOLDINGS, EVERY PIECE OF

11:16.300 --> 11:19.235
FURNITURE.

>> WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE

32:13.030 --> 32:14.099
GOING?

32:14.100 --> 32:14.998
>> SHOOT ME. I DON'T CARE

32:15.000 --> 32:15.523
ANYMORE.

32:15.530 --> 32:16.394
>> GET BACK HERE! YOU SHOVEL

32:16.400 --> 32:17.389
THAT GODDAMN DIRT INTO THAT

32:17.400 --> 32:19.265
GRAVE OR I SWEAR YOUR DEAD

32:19.270 --> 32:21.363
WEIGHT IS GONNA FINISH HER OFF.

32:21.370 --> 32:23.565
>> DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?

32:23.570 --> 32:29.179
I DON'T CARE!

32:29.180 --> 32:33.002
YOU WANT TWO DEAD BODIES?

32:33.010 --> 32:35.774
SHOOT ME.

32:35.780 --> 32:36.542
[COCKS GUN]

32:46.090 --> 32:52.393
>> YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE GUTS.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.560
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS TO CUT

32:53.570 --> 32:55.367
CHERRY, AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE

32:55.370 --> 32:56.735
GUTS TO PULL THAT TRIGGER NOW,

32:56.740 --> 33:01.404
DO YOU, EUGENE?

33:01.410 --> 33:04.243
>> UHH!

33:10.320 --> 33:12.288
>> IS HE DEAD?

33:12.290 --> 33:16.215
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT HE WILL BE.

33:23.200 --> 33:28.593
> > MATI'?

33:28.600 --> 33:32.309
PLEASE.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.437
>> DO IT.

33:40.580 --> 33:42.218
>> I SEE NO REASON TO PROLONG MY

33:42.220 --> 33:44.484
STAY HERE IN THE STATES NOW THAT

33:44.490 --> 33:46.219
MY WORK IS FINISHED.

33:46.220 --> 33:47.084
>> YOU MUST FEEL A SENSE OF

33:47.090 --> 33:48.455
SATISFACTION, HAVING CLOSED THE

33:48.460 --> 33:50.485
CASE, KNOWING YOU STOPPED

33:50.490 --> 33:51.718
SOMEONE FROM DESTROYING MORE

33:51.730 --> 33:53.220
LIVES.

33:53.230 --> 33:54.128
>> KILLING A HUMAN BEING NEVER

33:54.130 --> 33:56.621
FEELS GOOD, DR. MCNAMARA.

33:56.630 --> 33:58.621
>> HE WAS A DERANGED PSYCHOPATH,

33:58.630 --> 33:59.824
A MURDERER.

33:59.830 --> 34:00.797
>> BUT NO ONE'S BORN THAT WAY,

34:00.800 --> 34:03.234
ARE THEY?

34:03.240 --> 34:04.229
NO CHILD WHO'S EXPERIENCED WHAT

34:04.240 --> 34:05.229
QUENTIN EXPERIENCED CAN BE

34:05.240 --> 34:07.299
EXPECTED TO GROW UP SANE.

34:07.310 --> 34:08.277
THE PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES HE

34:08.280 --> 34:09.633
ENDURED, ABANDONED BY HIS

34:09.640 --> 34:13.246
PARENTS, PLACED IN A CONVENT.

34:13.250 --> 34:14.148
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW?

34:14.150 --> 34:14.878
>> WE UNCOVERED A CRUDE JOURNAL

34:14.880 --> 34:19.579
OF SORTS, BEGUN IN CHILDHOOD.

34:19.590 --> 34:20.545
IT PROVIDED US WITH CLUES TO A

34:20.550 --> 34:21.881
SECRET PAST THAT HE WAS

34:21.890 --> 34:23.812
DETERMINED TO REMEMBER, BUT

34:23.820 --> 34:27.529
NEVER TO BE REVEALED.

34:27.530 --> 34:30.590
HE HAD A SISTER, A YOUNGER

34:30.600 --> 34:32.727
SISTER, EVEN MORE HIDEOUSLY

34:32.730 --> 34:35.267
DEFORMED THAN HE WAS.

34:35.270 --> 34:37.397
THE RESULTS OF INCEST.

34:37.400 --> 34:40.130
FRONTONASAL DYSPLASIA IS THE

34:40.140 --> 34:40.834
TECHNICAL TERM.

34:40.840 --> 34:43.400
>> MEDIAN CLEFT FACE SYNDROME.

34:43.410 --> 34:44.399
>> THEIR PARENTS SENT THEM TO AN

34:44.410 --> 34:45.570
ISOLATED CONVENT IN NORTHERN

34:45.580 --> 34:48.276
MAINE. THE FRUITS OF THEIR

34:48.280 --> 34:49.508
CARNAL PLEASURE WERE TOO MUCH TO

34:49.520 --> 34:51.818
BEAR. QUENTEN'S DEFORMITIES

34:51.820 --> 34:54.288
COULD BE CLOAKED, VIOLET'S COULD

34:54.290 --> 34:56.815
NOT. PERSPECTIVE PARENTS WOULD

34:56.820 --> 34:57.855
COME...

34:57.860 --> 35:02.422
>> VIOLET, YOU HAVE VISITORS.

35:05.570 --> 35:06.889
>> BUT QUENTIN REFUSED TO LET

35:06.900 --> 35:08.663
THEM BE SEPARATED.

35:08.670 --> 35:09.830
>> AND WHAT HAPPENED? HOW DID HE

35:09.840 --> 35:11.728
GO FROM BEING THE BOY YOU'RE

35:11.740 --> 35:12.559
DESCRIBING--

35:12.570 --> 35:13.468
>> TO THE SERIAL RAPIST HE

35:13.470 --> 35:16.337
BECAME? HE WAS 15 WHEN THEY LEFT

35:16.340 --> 35:18.205
THE CONVENT. BUT QUENTIN WAS

35:18.210 --> 35:20.178
DRIVEN AND BRIGHT. HE PUT

35:20.180 --> 35:21.169
HIMSELF THROUGH MED SCHOOL AND

35:21.180 --> 35:22.841
BECAME A PLASTIC SURGEON,

35:22.850 --> 35:24.181
DETERMINED TO HELP HIS SISTER

35:24.190 --> 35:25.441
CONFORM TO OUR CULTURE'S DEMAND

35:25.450 --> 35:28.658
FOR PHYSICAL BEAUTY...

35:28.660 --> 35:29.513
SO THAT, FINALLY, THEY COULD

35:29.520 --> 35:36.858
BOTH BE LOVED.

35:36.860 --> 35:39.499
>> BEAUTY IS A CURSE.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.762
>> VIOLET UNDERWENT 8 SURGERIES

35:40.770 --> 35:42.465
AT HER BROTHER'S HAND TO REPAIR

35:42.470 --> 35:45.860
THE DIVISION IN HER FACE,

35:45.870 --> 35:47.508
TO CLOSE THE BONES IN HER SKULL.

35:47.510 --> 35:48.875
3 MORE ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THE

35:48.880 --> 35:49.778
SKIN ABNORMALITIES SO THAT

35:49.780 --> 35:50.872
FINALLY OTHERS WOULD LOOK AT HER

35:50.880 --> 36:00.915
WITHOUT GASPING IN HORROR.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.410
DURING THE FINAL SURGERY, BEFORE

36:02.420 --> 36:04.479
HE COULD FINISH, SHE SUFFERED A

36:04.490 --> 36:10.656
STROKE AND DIED. SHE WAS 29.

36:10.660 --> 36:14.790
>> SO HE BLAMED US?

36:14.800 --> 36:15.960
>> AS PLASTIC SURGEONS, YOU

36:15.970 --> 36:17.232
EXPLOIT THE SOCIAL PRESSURES

36:17.240 --> 36:18.867
THAT CAUSED HER SUCH AGONY.

36:18.870 --> 36:19.700
>> BUT HE COULD HAVE GONE

36:19.710 --> 36:22.008
ANYWHERE, SOME OTHER PRACTICE.

36:22.010 --> 36:24.501
>> IT'S THE SUNSHINE STATE.

36:24.510 --> 36:25.499
THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BEAUTY ARE

36:25.510 --> 36:27.307
GREATEST HERE. HE COULD MAKE A

36:27.310 --> 36:29.369
STATEMENT AND BE HEARD. HE COULD

36:29.380 --> 36:30.642
VENT HIS RAGE HERE.

36:35.790 --> 36:38.258
>> WE, UH, APPRECIATE YOUR

36:38.260 --> 36:40.888
DILIGENCE AND YOUR

36:40.890 --> 36:45.759
IMPECCABLE TIMING, KIT.

36:45.770 --> 36:48.295
YOU SAVED OUR LIVES.

36:48.300 --> 36:49.335
>> I'M JUST GLAD THAT GINA

36:49.340 --> 36:51.365
CALLED 911 WHEN SHE DID.

36:51.370 --> 36:52.439
HOW IS SHE?

36:52.440 --> 36:55.273
>> DON'T SCREW THIS UP, ASSHOLE.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.269
I'M PLANNING TO GET A BOOK DEAL

36:56.280 --> 36:57.372
OUT OF THIS, AND I DON'T WANT TO

36:57.380 --> 36:58.540
LOOK LIKE THE JOKER ON MY DUST

36:58.550 --> 36:59.608
JACKET.

36:59.610 --> 37:00.702
>> WHAT'S THE TITLE GONNA BE?

37:00.710 --> 37:01.813
EVEN THE CARVER WOULDN'T STICK

37:01.820 --> 37:03.276
HIS DICK IN ME?

37:03.280 --> 37:05.714
>> OH, THAT'S NICE, CHRISTIAN.

37:05.720 --> 37:06.687
>> WHAT WERE YOU DOING HERE,

37:06.690 --> 37:07.782
GINA? I MEAN, TALK ABOUT BEING

37:07.790 --> 37:08.950
AT THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG

37:08.960 --> 37:10.416
TIME.

37:10.420 --> 37:11.057
>> I WAS DROPPING OFF A

37:11.060 --> 37:13.528
CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR HIM.

37:13.530 --> 37:15.498
I WAS INVITED TO THIS BIG

37:15.500 --> 37:17.297
NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY AND WITH

37:17.300 --> 37:18.028
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WITH

37:18.030 --> 37:20.567
KIMBER, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT

37:20.570 --> 37:22.663
ACTUALLY BE VULNERABLE ENOUGH TO

37:22.670 --> 37:25.901
BE MY DATE.

37:25.910 --> 37:27.036
MAYBE JUST BE OPEN TO A PETTY

37:27.040 --> 37:28.576
SCREW.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.672
>> I WOULD NEVER BE VULNERABLE

37:29.680 --> 37:35.368
ENOUGH TO SCREW YOU AGAIN, GINA.

37:35.380 --> 37:36.938
I WOULDN'T WANT TO RUIN OUR

37:36.950 --> 37:39.043
FRIENDSHIP.

37:39.050 --> 37:40.312
>> I'M JUST GRATEFUL THAT YOU

37:40.320 --> 37:41.582
WERE HERE, GINA. IF IT WASN'T

37:41.590 --> 37:42.989
FOR YOUR 911 CALL, KIT WOULD

37:42.990 --> 37:44.958
NEVER HAVE MADE IT HERE IN TIME.

37:44.960 --> 37:48.999
>> WHAT 911 CALL?

37:49.000 --> 37:49.955
WHATEVER HE DRUGGED ME WITH

37:49.960 --> 37:51.825
KNOCKED ME OUT UNTIL AFTER THE

37:51.830 --> 37:57.393
POLICE SHOWED UP.

38:08.420 --> 38:13.346
>> WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

38:13.350 --> 38:14.510
>> YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS REEKS OF

38:14.520 --> 38:16.681
OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE TO ME.

38:16.690 --> 38:17.486
TRAVELING ALL THE WAY TO

38:17.490 --> 38:18.457
NORTHERN MAINE SO THAT WE CAN

38:18.460 --> 38:19.620
VISIT SOME GODFORSAKEN

38:19.630 --> 38:20.881
ORPHANAGE. I DON'T SEE WHY THIS

38:20.890 --> 38:21.754
IS OUR PROBLEM.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.352
>> BECAUSE IT'S NOBODY ELSE'S.

38:23.360 --> 38:24.361
COPS DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT

38:24.370 --> 38:25.894
IT. IT'S A HIGH-PROFILE CASE

38:25.900 --> 38:27.094
THAT'S SOLVED. THAT'S IT.

38:27.100 --> 38:29.398
NO MORE QUESTIONS. CASE CLOSED.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.936
WELL, IT'S NOT CLOSED FOR ME.

38:30.940 --> 38:32.737
KIT LIED ABOUT GINA CALLING 911.

38:32.740 --> 38:33.934
WHAT ELSE DID SHE LIE ABOUT?

38:33.940 --> 38:34.929
>> WHAT'S COMING HERE IN PERSON

38:34.940 --> 38:36.703
GONNA SOLVE, HUH? FIND OUT THAT

38:36.710 --> 38:37.779
THE SISTERS OF THE MOST HOLY

38:37.780 --> 38:38.906
THORNY CROWN ARE INVOLVED IN THE

38:38.910 --> 38:39.842
COVER-U P?

38:39.850 --> 38:41.545
>> I EXPECT TO FIND THE TRUTH,

38:41.550 --> 38:42.710
WHAT KIT SAID ABOUT QUENTIN

38:42.720 --> 38:44.642
REALLY HAPPENED AND PUT THIS

38:44.650 --> 38:45.810
NIGHTMARE BEHIND US.

38:45.820 --> 38:48.516
> > EXCUSE ME?

38:48.520 --> 38:50.988
MAY I HELP YOU?

38:50.990 --> 38:53.379
>> YES. AN ASSOCIATE OF OURS WHO

38:53.390 --> 38:55.790
GREW UP HERE RECENTLY DIED.

38:55.800 --> 38:56.949
HIS NAME WAS QUENTIN COSTA.

38:56.960 --> 38:57.892
WE WERE HOPING--

38:57.900 --> 39:00.926
>> DR. COSTA?

39:00.930 --> 39:02.659
WILL YOU WAIT HERE A MOMENT?

39:02.670 --> 39:09.803
I'LL GO GET MOTHER MARY CLAIRE.

39:09.810 --> 39:12.608
>> HOW DID HE DIE? QUENTIN.

39:12.610 --> 39:14.817
>> HE WAS SHOT. WRONG PLACE AT

39:14.820 --> 39:15.946
THE WRONG TIME. IT'S UNDER

39:15.950 --> 39:16.939
INVESTIGATION.

39:16.950 --> 39:17.939
>> WE UNDERSTAND HE GREW UP

39:17.950 --> 39:18.939
HERE.

39:18.950 --> 39:20.486
>> YES. I'D ONLY BEEN HERE A

39:20.490 --> 39:22.708
SHORT WHILE WHEN HE CAME TO US

39:22.720 --> 39:24.927
WITH HIS POOR SISTER. THEY WERE

39:24.930 --> 39:27.683
VERY DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER.

39:27.690 --> 39:28.691
>> HE MUST HAVE BEEN HEARTBROKEN

39:28.700 --> 39:30.497
WHEN SHE DIED.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.968
>> DEAR LORD. SHE DIED AS WELL?

39:32.970 --> 39:35.666
I HAD NO IDEA.

39:35.670 --> 39:36.659
>> IN HER TWENTIES. THAT'S WHAT

39:36.670 --> 39:37.739
WE WERE TOLD.

39:37.740 --> 39:39.105
>> THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE. MANY OF

39:39.110 --> 39:40.805
OUR CHILDREN, THEY SEND US

39:40.810 --> 39:42.607
PHOTOGRAPHS AROUND THIS TIME OF

39:42.610 --> 39:47.104
YEAR TO KEEP IN TOUCH.

39:47.110 --> 39:50.079
I BELIEVE WE RECEIVED A PICTURE

39:50.080 --> 39:52.548
FROM THEM 2-3 YEARS AGO.

39:52.550 --> 39:53.539
>> ACCORDING TO THE POLICE,

39:53.550 --> 39:55.450
VIOLET DIED DURING A SURGICAL

39:55.460 --> 39:56.609
PROCEDURE.

39:56.620 --> 39:58.679
> > VIOLET?

39:58.690 --> 40:01.124
HER NAME'S KATHERINE.

40:01.130 --> 40:02.995
WE CALLED HER KIT.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.467
SHE RELOCATED TO A SUBURB

40:04.470 --> 40:05.823
OUTSIDE LONDON YEARS AGO.

40:05.830 --> 40:07.468
I DON'T HAVE AN ADDRESS ON HER,

40:07.470 --> 40:08.937
I'M AFRAID.

40:26.890 --> 40:29.484
> > GRACIAS.

40:33.030 --> 40:35.692
>> CAREFUL, SIS. YOU REMEMBER

40:35.700 --> 40:36.792
WHAT I HAD TO DO TO YOU THE LAST

40:36.800 --> 40:37.824
TIME YOU GOT TOO INVOLVED WITH A

40:37.830 --> 40:41.220
MAN. I SPENT TOO MUCH TIME

40:41.230 --> 40:42.265
CREATING YOUR FACE TO HAVE TO

40:42.270 --> 40:45.000
CARVE IT UP AGAIN.

40:45.010 --> 40:48.002
>> JEALOUSY IS SO UNATTRACT IVE.

40:48.010 --> 40:49.272
YOU KNOW CHRISTIAN WAS JUST A

40:49.280 --> 40:50.508
PASSING FANCY.

40:50.510 --> 40:51.738
>> HMM. IS THAT WHY YOU MANAGED

40:51.750 --> 40:52.705
TO SHOW UP AT HIS OFFICE RIGHT

40:52.710 --> 40:53.802
BEFORE I GOT HIM TO TAKE HIS OWN

40:53.810 --> 40:55.812
HAND OFF?

40:55.820 --> 40:56.844
>> I ARRIVED AT THE EXACT TIME

40:56.850 --> 40:57.874
WE ARRANGED. DON'T YOU DARE

40:57.880 --> 41:00.144
LECTURE ME ABOUT THAT.

41:00.150 --> 41:01.117
YOU THINK I LIKE HAVING TO CARVE

41:01.120 --> 41:04.180
YOU UP AND THEN SHOOT YOU?

41:04.190 --> 41:05.179
>> WELL, I'D HAVE BEEN MORE

41:05.190 --> 41:06.259
COMFORTABLE WITH THE PLAN IF YOU

41:06.260 --> 41:08.023
DIDN'T DECIDED TO GO OFF BOOK

41:08.030 --> 41:09.190
AND TELL THOSE TWO MY ENTIRE

41:09.200 --> 41:11.259
LIFE STORY.

41:11.260 --> 41:12.761
>> I NEEDED THEM TO UNDERSTAND

41:12.770 --> 41:15.034
YOU. YOU'RE NOT A DERANGED

41:15.040 --> 41:16.632
LUNATIC. YOU'RE A GOOD MAN

41:16.640 --> 41:18.528
WHO STRUGGLED HIS WHOLE LIFE

41:18.540 --> 41:19.734
AGAINST ODDS THAT THEY CAN'T

41:19.740 --> 41:25.007
EVEN IMAGINE.

41:25.010 --> 41:26.102
NOW STOP BEING SUCH A WHINY

41:26.110 --> 41:29.216
BITCH AND DRINK YOUR SANGRIA.

41:29.220 --> 41:30.175
WHAT WAS THE HARM ANYWAY?

41:30.180 --> 41:32.546
THEY THINK YOU'RE DEAD.

41:50.770 --> 41:53.136
>> DID YOU SEE HER?

41:53.140 --> 41:54.971
HER ONLY BIRTH DEFECT WAS BEING

41:54.980 --> 41:56.777
BORN RICH, AND SHE STILL HAD HER
