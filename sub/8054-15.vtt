00:00.669 --> 00:03.075
Hi, I'm Tom Haverford. I work at the parks department.

00:03.932 --> 00:04.986
It's a little douchy

00:05.600 --> 00:06.466
Good call, J.

00:06.466 --> 00:08.703
I'm getting divorced, so i'm trying to up my game.

00:08.703 --> 00:10.971
Who am I supposed to ask
for fashion device? Jerry?

00:11.039 --> 00:13.207
He wears the same
soup-stained khakis every day.

00:13.275 --> 00:14.809
Justin's my savior.

00:14.876 --> 00:17.044
He's like an issue of <i>gq</i>
that's come to life.

00:17.112 --> 00:19.580
- * duh-duh-duh
duh-duh duh-duh duh-na-ba *

00:19.648 --> 00:20.614
Tommy timberlake.

00:20.682 --> 00:23.350
- You look like
encyclopedia brown.

00:23.418 --> 00:26.053
- Sequins!

00:26.121 --> 00:29.757
- Try it without the gloves.
- Sequins!

00:29.825 --> 00:31.392
Minus the gloves.

00:31.460 --> 00:32.860
Hey, what's up.
I'm tom.

00:32.928 --> 00:36.063
Is my shirt lighting up,
'cause I didn't even notice.

00:36.131 --> 00:37.364
All right, guys,
let's talk accessories.

00:37.432 --> 00:38.966
Be honest.
Which cane do you like better?

00:39.034 --> 00:41.502
Dragon. Serpent.
Dragon. Serpent.

00:41.570 --> 00:43.337
Belt buckle
says "what's crackin'?"

00:43.371 --> 00:44.638
I can have it say
whatever I want.

00:44.706 --> 00:46.073
It can say "what's crackin'?
I'm tom."

00:46.141 --> 00:47.975
"what's crackin', girl?"
"what's crackin', boo?"

00:48.043 --> 00:50.978
Eagle medallion.
[as bird] gah gah.

00:51.046 --> 00:53.614
- Well, as far as white leather
suits go...

00:53.682 --> 00:57.318
- It's horrible.
- I like it.

00:59.454 --> 01:02.356

01:19.691 --> 01:23.888
- Sweetums has been pawnee's
leading sweet treat manufacturer

01:23.888 --> 01:25.923
For over 80 years.

01:25.990 --> 01:30.193
And we are so excited
about our new partnership

01:30.261 --> 01:32.029
With the parks department.

01:32.096 --> 01:33.497
[cheers and applause]
huh? Welcome.

01:33.565 --> 01:34.798
- Starting next month,

01:34.866 --> 01:36.667
Sweetums is gonna take over
the concession stands

01:36.734 --> 01:38.035
In our parks.

01:38.102 --> 01:40.404
I-I don't love the idea
of corporate sponsorship,

01:40.471 --> 01:42.906
But sweetums
is an institution.

01:42.974 --> 01:45.275
When you think of pawnee,
you think of sweetums.

01:45.343 --> 01:48.145
- Although candy
is our bread and butter,

01:48.212 --> 01:50.948
We also care about the health
of our customers.

01:51.015 --> 01:55.852
And that's why we'll be debuting
our new, healthy energy bar,

01:55.920 --> 01:57.721
Nutriyums.

01:57.789 --> 02:00.490
Take a look.

02:00.558 --> 02:04.561
- Hi. I'm nick newport, jr.
Ceo of sweetums.

02:04.629 --> 02:07.631
And I'd like to introduce to you
our new line of energy bars,

02:07.699 --> 02:09.098
Nutriyums.

02:09.167 --> 02:11.401
We start with 100%
all-natural corn.

02:11.469 --> 02:13.870
Then we add just a little bit
of sweetums' corn syrup,

02:13.938 --> 02:16.440
Little drop of sunshine,
and some other stuff.

02:16.507 --> 02:17.708
And since
they're from sweetums,

02:17.775 --> 02:19.009
You know your kids are gonna
love it.

02:19.077 --> 02:20.277
- Wow, that family looks
so healthy.

02:20.345 --> 02:21.645
Look at them.
They're all wearing vests.

02:21.713 --> 02:23.480
- Dakota, denver.
[dog barks]

02:23.548 --> 02:25.382
Sorry, shoelace,
we don't make nutriyums

02:25.450 --> 02:27.451
For dogs...Yet.

02:27.518 --> 02:29.453
- [laughs] shoelace.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.555
- Nutriyums,
where nutritious meets tasty.

02:31.623 --> 02:32.823
By sweetums.

02:34.292 --> 02:37.494
- If you can't beat 'em...
- All: Sweetums!

02:37.562 --> 02:39.262
- I could not be happier
about this.

02:39.330 --> 02:42.633
I think the entire government
should be privatized.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.369
Chuck e. Cheese
could run the parks.

02:45.436 --> 02:47.671
Everything operated
by tokens.

02:47.739 --> 02:50.107
Drop in a token,
go on the swing set.

02:50.174 --> 02:53.110
Drop in another token,
take a walk.

02:53.177 --> 02:56.713
Drop in a token,
look at a duck.

02:56.781 --> 02:59.983
- * brendanawicz *
quick question.

03:00.051 --> 03:01.351
Do you personally know
xzibit?

03:01.419 --> 03:03.220
Because I was checking out
that pickup truck of yours

03:03.287 --> 03:05.088
And that ride is pimp.

03:05.156 --> 03:08.191
- It's really nice of you
to compliment my pickup truck

03:08.259 --> 03:09.493
With no ulterior motive.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.361
- Yeah, so listen,
I need to move some stuff

03:11.429 --> 03:13.230
This weekend
into my new bachelor pad

03:13.297 --> 03:14.831
Since my divorce
is finally going down.

03:14.899 --> 03:15.866
Just some odds and ends.

03:15.933 --> 03:17.167
You can bring over
the markmobile,

03:17.235 --> 03:18.568
Help me move, right?

03:18.636 --> 03:21.304
- I'm totally blanking
on a valid excuse right now.

03:21.372 --> 03:24.841
So yes, I'll help you.
- My boy!

03:24.909 --> 03:27.644
- I [bleep] hate
having a pickup truck.

03:27.712 --> 03:29.780
- Andy, I have
a very interesting

03:29.847 --> 03:31.882
Business proposal for you.

03:31.949 --> 03:33.884
I'm moving a lot of heavy stuff
out of my place this weekend.

03:33.951 --> 03:37.320
- Can I help you move?
I'm really good at it.

03:37.388 --> 03:39.156
Afterwards, I'll take
the cardboard from the boxes

03:39.223 --> 03:40.190
And I'll use it
for break dancing.

03:40.258 --> 03:42.325
- I'll go too.
- Really.

03:42.393 --> 03:43.727
'cause an hour ago,
you told me

03:43.795 --> 03:45.529
You'd rather watch a sex tape
of your grandparents.

03:45.596 --> 03:48.331
- Shut up. I don't have
anything else to do.

03:48.399 --> 03:49.599
Do you want help or not?

03:49.667 --> 03:52.169
- All right.
See you guys later.

03:52.236 --> 03:53.704
- I think that that's
really, really sweet

03:53.771 --> 03:57.507
That your grandparents
still make love.

04:02.880 --> 04:06.817
- Oh. Ready to go?
- Yes. Your keys, please.

04:06.884 --> 04:08.385
- [chuckles] you got to be
kidding me.

04:08.453 --> 04:09.653
I'm fine.

04:09.721 --> 04:12.489
- We'll let the chart
be the judge of that.

04:12.557 --> 04:15.992
What, are you 5'11"?
210 pounds.

04:16.060 --> 04:18.028
Three whiskeys.

04:18.096 --> 04:20.997
It looks like you're just
over the line into impaired.

04:21.065 --> 04:22.699
- You carry that with you
all the time?

04:22.767 --> 04:24.301
- It comes in handy.

04:24.368 --> 04:26.903
And on the back, it teaches you
how to play blackjack.

04:26.971 --> 04:28.739
- Swansons have
a preternaturally high tolerance

04:28.806 --> 04:30.073
For alcohol.

04:30.141 --> 04:32.375
My old man used to put
wild turkey on his corn flakes.

04:32.443 --> 04:33.710
- I'm not gonna argue
with you, ron.

04:33.778 --> 04:35.445
We're just gonna sit and wait
until, you know,

04:35.513 --> 04:39.349
You're safe to drive,
which would be in about...

04:39.417 --> 04:42.219
One hour.

04:42.286 --> 04:47.057
"insurance is a side bet
when you wager half

04:47.125 --> 04:49.459
"of your original bet
because you believe the dealer

04:49.527 --> 04:52.729
Has a 10 in the hole."

04:52.797 --> 04:54.030
- [honks horn]

04:54.098 --> 04:57.734
- Get off my car, woman!
- 20 minutes!

04:57.802 --> 05:00.337
The dealer really has
an advantage.

05:00.404 --> 05:02.339
That's what I get the most
from this.

05:06.577 --> 05:09.212
Hey, ron.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.415
- Morning, leslie.
Did you have a good night?

05:12.483 --> 05:14.017
- I did. I watched
a really good docu--

05:14.085 --> 05:15.051
What is that?

05:15.119 --> 05:16.753
- This is what I did
last night.

05:16.821 --> 05:18.088
After I got home,

05:18.156 --> 05:20.590
I drank six more glasses
of whiskey

05:20.658 --> 05:23.026
And then I finished crafting
this small harp

05:23.094 --> 05:24.995
Using a band saw,
a spokeshave,

05:25.062 --> 05:26.963
And an oscillating
spindle sander.

05:27.031 --> 05:28.999
[harp strings ring
harmoniously]

05:29.066 --> 05:31.234
- Beautiful.
- But wait, there's more.

05:31.302 --> 05:34.004
Here are some photographs
of me drinking the whiskey.

05:34.071 --> 05:36.006
You'll notice I'm holding up
yesterday's newspaper

05:36.073 --> 05:38.175
So you can tell
that I'm not lying.

05:38.242 --> 05:40.977
- Mm. I feel
like I'm in a spa.

05:43.481 --> 05:45.081
- So I got my truck
all cleaned out

05:45.149 --> 05:46.449
And ready to go
for tomorrow.

05:46.517 --> 05:49.352
Do you have, like,
furniture pads and, uh, dollies,

05:49.420 --> 05:50.487
That sort of thing?

05:50.555 --> 05:51.988
- Ooh. I thought the mover
supplied those.

05:52.056 --> 05:55.759
- I'm not a mover.
I'm a sap who owns a truck.

05:55.827 --> 05:57.360
- Don't talk about yourself
like that.

05:57.428 --> 06:00.130
And bring some coffee.
- Hey, are you moving out?

06:00.198 --> 06:01.731
Have you told wendy
how you feel yet?

06:01.799 --> 06:03.767
- Uh, waiting
for the right time.

06:03.835 --> 06:05.769
- It's right now.
The time is now.

06:05.837 --> 06:07.170
- Just don't worry about it.
I'm fine.

06:07.238 --> 06:09.206
- Hmm.
- What's that over there?

06:09.273 --> 06:10.507
- Mm.
- Holy cow.

06:10.575 --> 06:11.675
- Mm.
- Man.

06:11.742 --> 06:13.143
- Wow.
- That is good stuff.

06:13.211 --> 06:14.678
- Great, right?
- Oh, my god.

06:14.745 --> 06:16.513
They're amazing.
- They're more than amazing.

06:16.581 --> 06:17.981
They are terrific.

06:18.049 --> 06:19.983
- Terrific's not more
than amazing, jerry.

06:20.051 --> 06:21.852
- No?
Well, it's not less.

06:21.919 --> 06:24.321
- Everything sweetums makes
is off the charts.

06:24.388 --> 06:25.856
I like their candy
fingernails.

06:25.923 --> 06:27.724
- I can't believe
these things are healthy.

06:27.792 --> 06:28.925
- Mm.
- Well, it's not that crazy.

06:28.993 --> 06:30.727
Krackel bar is also healthy
and delicious.

06:30.795 --> 06:32.963
- No, they're not.
- Yeah.

06:33.030 --> 06:35.298
They--they actually have rice
in them, so...

06:35.366 --> 06:40.537
- Mm, andy, you're fine,
but you're simple.

06:40.605 --> 06:41.972
[muffled dance music]

06:42.039 --> 06:43.874
* *

06:43.941 --> 06:46.509
- Who just put 100 of these
in their body?

06:46.544 --> 06:49.479
- Annnnnnn!
Oh! Look at you!

06:49.547 --> 06:51.114
You're looking pretty
unhealthy today.

06:51.182 --> 06:52.182
You might need
one of these.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.717
Nutriyum by sweetums.

06:53.784 --> 06:55.352
* if you can't beat 'em,
sweetums *

06:55.419 --> 06:57.354
- I love that song.
- Ow!

06:57.421 --> 06:59.055
- I got to go check
my email.

06:59.123 --> 07:00.624
- We're gonna sell these
in the park now.

07:00.691 --> 07:03.293
- They're healthy.
- Holy god.

07:03.361 --> 07:04.794
No, they're not.
They're terrible for you.

07:04.862 --> 07:06.129
- No, they're not.

07:06.197 --> 07:07.731
There's a picture
of lance armstrong on there.

07:07.798 --> 07:08.932
- Yeah, but look
at the ingredients.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.634
High-fructose corn syrup,
corn syrup--

07:10.701 --> 07:13.036
- There's only 8 grams of fat.
- Yeah. Per serving.

07:13.104 --> 07:14.704
A bar is four servings.

07:14.772 --> 07:16.106
- Well, people seem
to enjoy them.

07:16.173 --> 07:17.607
Look how happy
everybody is.

07:17.675 --> 07:19.910
[dance music playing loudly]

07:19.977 --> 07:21.778
* *

07:21.846 --> 07:23.914
- Yeah,
that's a sugar rush.

07:23.981 --> 07:24.948
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:25.016 --> 07:25.916
- That makes sense.

07:25.983 --> 07:26.917
- They're gonna crash soon

07:26.984 --> 07:28.018
And it's not
gonna be pretty.

07:28.085 --> 07:29.252
- Yeah, I'm gonna crash
soon too

07:29.320 --> 07:30.620
'cause I've eaten, like,
40 of these.

07:30.688 --> 07:32.122
- Oh, god.

07:32.189 --> 07:34.658
Generally, I like to stay out
of other people's business.

07:34.725 --> 07:37.727
But pawnee is the fourth most
obese city in america.

07:37.795 --> 07:39.462
The kids here are beefy.

07:39.530 --> 07:44.701
They're just husky, big-boned,
plus-sized chunk monsters.

07:44.769 --> 07:47.003
I call 'em like I see 'em.

07:47.071 --> 07:50.974
[silence]

07:51.042 --> 07:52.442
- Leslie.
- Yeah.

07:52.510 --> 07:54.344
- Let's get some almonds
in you, okay?

07:54.412 --> 07:56.012
- Okay.
- Can--

07:56.080 --> 07:58.381
- I can't open them.

07:58.449 --> 08:00.884
- [sprays]
- oh! Back to work.

08:00.952 --> 08:02.886
I hate it here.
This place is evil.

08:02.954 --> 08:04.321
- I think these
are the only two films

08:04.388 --> 08:05.922
That say "sweetums"
on the label.

08:05.990 --> 08:07.424
- Yeah, well, let's take
them both.

08:07.491 --> 08:09.059
We might find something
interesting.

08:09.126 --> 08:10.727
Here. Just--I'll stick them
under my shirt.

08:10.795 --> 08:12.929
We'll just walk out.
- They have sensors.

08:12.997 --> 08:14.597
Just check them out.
It's free.

08:14.665 --> 08:18.001
- Hi, marci.
- Leslie.

08:18.069 --> 08:20.136
Are they finally teaching
you parks people how to read?

08:20.204 --> 08:23.406
Ha. Oh, I guess not.
It's a movie.

08:23.474 --> 08:25.008
- You're pretty cocky
for someone whose job

08:25.076 --> 08:26.910
Is obsolete
because of the internet.

08:26.978 --> 08:30.747
- [laughs]
let's see.

08:30.815 --> 08:34.150
Hmm. You seem to have a $40
late fee on a book called

08:34.217 --> 08:36.519
[shouting] <i>mysteries</i>
<i>of the female orgasm!</i>

08:36.587 --> 08:39.556
- No, I don't!
- Yeah, you do.

08:39.623 --> 08:44.159
- Ann, grab the movie.
Go! Go! Go! Go!

08:44.227 --> 08:46.129
Punk ass book jockeys!

08:46.197 --> 08:50.433
[alarm beeping]

08:50.501 --> 08:52.569
- So you guys all good

08:52.636 --> 08:54.771
With, uh, sweetums' concession
stand deal?

08:54.839 --> 08:56.673
I can go ahead and sign off
on it?

08:56.741 --> 08:58.441
- You bet ya.
- Actually, no. No.

08:58.509 --> 08:59.743
We are worried
that the energy bars

08:59.810 --> 09:01.544
That they're gonna sell
are grossly unhealthy

09:01.612 --> 09:04.214
And they're misleading people
about what's actually in them.

09:04.281 --> 09:06.349
- No. We're not worried
about that.

09:06.417 --> 09:08.651
We're fine
and we sign off.

09:08.719 --> 09:10.420
- Paul, can I have a sidebar
with ron?

09:10.488 --> 09:13.123
- I guess.
- Sidebar, ron.

09:13.190 --> 09:14.357
I did some research
and nutriyums

09:14.425 --> 09:15.425
Are terrible for you.

09:15.493 --> 09:16.993
- I don't care.
We're doing it.

09:17.061 --> 09:19.095
- Nah--ta--plee--buh-huh--
we're in a sidebar.

09:19.163 --> 09:21.331
Uh, do you not care
about your city's health?

09:21.399 --> 09:22.732
- I care
about the people's right

09:22.800 --> 09:24.434
To consume
whatever they want.

09:24.502 --> 09:26.770
- Paul, can you and I
have a sidebar?

09:26.837 --> 09:28.271
- No.

09:28.339 --> 09:30.173
- Okay, I think maybe
we should hold a public forum.

09:30.241 --> 09:31.674
That way we won't
be liable.

09:31.742 --> 09:34.310
- There's no point.
It's a homrun for the city.

09:34.378 --> 09:35.845
- No, I think she's right.

09:35.913 --> 09:37.914
It's a good
"cover our ass" move.

09:37.982 --> 09:39.949
Let's do it.
- Paul.

09:40.017 --> 09:41.618
Leslie, why must you stick
your nose

09:41.685 --> 09:42.886
Into everyone else's
business?

09:42.953 --> 09:44.421
- Sidebar, paul.

09:44.488 --> 09:46.356
Ron's upset because I didn't
let him drive last night.

09:46.424 --> 09:49.259
- Stop sidebaring.

09:49.326 --> 09:51.761
- Somebody's grouchy.

09:53.398 --> 09:54.862
- You said it was just
odds and ends.

09:54.862 --> 09:55.962
- It is. Yeah.
And some furniture.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.874
And--and the plasma tv.

09:57.874 --> 09:59.274
- You haven't even folded up
the boxes yet.

09:59.342 --> 10:03.879
- Dude, <i>deep blue sea.</i>
Greatest movie ever made.

10:03.946 --> 10:06.148
- That's the canadian version.
22 extra minutes.

10:06.215 --> 10:07.449
And there's a bonus
audio track

10:07.517 --> 10:08.950
Where ll cool j raps
all his dialogue.

10:09.018 --> 10:12.387
- What? We're watching this
right now.

10:12.455 --> 10:13.655
- No, no, no.
- Pop it in.

10:13.723 --> 10:16.425
- We should really pack
this room up and get moving.

10:16.492 --> 10:20.562
- So this is a really big room
I need packed up, guys.

10:20.630 --> 10:23.231
- This is your bedroom?

10:23.299 --> 10:25.667
- No. It's a spare room
I converted

10:25.735 --> 10:29.004
Into a walk-in closet/
home fitness center.

10:29.072 --> 10:30.505
- What is that?

10:30.573 --> 10:33.008
- Oh. I strapped
an mp3 player

10:33.076 --> 10:34.443
To one of those
floor-cleaning robots.

10:34.510 --> 10:35.644
I call him dj roomba.

10:35.711 --> 10:37.312
Little guy cruises around
and plays music.

10:37.380 --> 10:38.513
What's hot, dj roomba?

10:38.581 --> 10:40.515
[hip-hop music]

10:40.583 --> 10:44.152
Dj roomba, tearing it up!

10:44.220 --> 10:48.323
- He likes me.
[laughs]

10:48.391 --> 10:51.593
- Let's dance for a little
while, mark. What--?

10:51.661 --> 10:54.729
- Nutriyums energy bars
are just absolutely loaded

10:54.797 --> 10:56.998
With high-fructose corn syrup
and fatty oils.

10:57.066 --> 10:58.333
And any way you slice it,

10:58.401 --> 11:01.203
They're just extremely unhealthy
for you.

11:01.270 --> 11:02.838
- Leslie needs to butt out.

11:02.905 --> 11:04.840
The whole point
of this country

11:04.907 --> 11:07.742
Is if you want to eat garbage,
balloon up to 600 pounds,

11:07.810 --> 11:11.046
And die of a heart attack
at 43, you can.

11:11.114 --> 11:14.783
You are free to do so.
To me, that's beautiful.

11:14.851 --> 11:16.718
- [exhales]
any questions?

11:16.786 --> 11:18.253
- I--if sugar's so bad,

11:18.321 --> 11:20.188
How come jesus made it taste
so good?

11:20.256 --> 11:23.291
- Uh...Yes.

11:23.359 --> 11:24.693
- But isn't all food
bad for you?

11:24.760 --> 11:26.495
I've been eating
lasagna and muffins

11:26.562 --> 11:27.796
Every day of my life
for 40 years

11:27.864 --> 11:28.864
And I feel terrible.

11:28.931 --> 11:30.398
- Right.

11:30.466 --> 11:31.733
- What's so bad
about corn syrup?

11:31.801 --> 11:33.635
It's natural.
Corn's a fruit.

11:33.703 --> 11:35.570
Syrup comes from a bush.

11:35.638 --> 11:37.472
- Oh, boy.

11:37.540 --> 11:39.341
- How do we know
you're really a nurse?

11:39.408 --> 11:41.209
- I am. I promise.
I work at st. Joe's.

11:41.277 --> 11:44.446
- Well, the point is my friend
thinks you're cute.

11:44.514 --> 11:46.047
Give me your number
so he can have it.

11:46.115 --> 11:48.150
- Yeah.
That's not gonna happen.

11:48.217 --> 11:50.018
- Can I have your email address?
I just got on aol.

11:50.086 --> 11:51.319
- Oh, my god. No.

11:51.387 --> 11:52.821
- I think we ought to throw
those bars out

11:52.889 --> 11:54.689
And eat ham and mayonnaise
sandwiches.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.424
- That's not a good idea.
- Ham and mayonnaise!

11:56.492 --> 11:57.759
- It's not--
- ham and mayonnaise!

11:57.827 --> 11:58.994
- No, no, no.

11:59.061 --> 12:01.997
[people chanting
"ham and mayonnaise"]

12:02.064 --> 12:03.932
- Oh, god, I can't believe
you do this every week.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.200
- I'm actually encouraged.

12:05.268 --> 12:07.169
The questions were more relevant
than usual.

12:07.236 --> 12:09.371
- Yeah, I need to order
the brown timberlands

12:09.438 --> 12:11.406
In a size 8, narrow.

12:11.474 --> 12:14.176
How much is the next-day
shipping?

12:14.243 --> 12:15.911
I don't--
what's two-day shipping?

12:15.978 --> 12:19.581
Yeah, I'd like to place an order
for one pad thai, chicken.

12:19.649 --> 12:21.583
And, uh, no scallions on it,
please.

12:21.651 --> 12:23.919
Just for one person.
Yeah, just one.

12:23.986 --> 12:26.688
Man, I saw mark carrying,
like, three boxes.

12:26.756 --> 12:27.889
That dude is strong.

12:27.957 --> 12:30.592
- Whatever.
I'll carry five boxes.

12:30.660 --> 12:34.262
- Go get 'em, champ.

12:34.330 --> 12:36.264
- Okay, donna, where do you
want this?

12:36.332 --> 12:38.033
- Uh-uh, that's it.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.101
My baby has a delicate
suspension.

12:40.169 --> 12:42.370
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not. Move.

12:42.438 --> 12:43.705
- Put it in your truck,
brendanawicz.

12:43.773 --> 12:47.876
There's plenty of room.

12:47.944 --> 12:51.980
- Hey! Ee! Ah!
My pocket squares!

12:52.048 --> 12:53.148
[dog barking]

12:53.216 --> 12:54.216
- Sorry, shoelace,

12:54.283 --> 12:56.952
We don't make nutriyums
for dogs...Yet.

12:57.019 --> 12:59.688
- Nutriyums,
where nutritious meets tasty.

12:59.755 --> 13:01.423
By sweetums.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.791
- I guess that about says
it all.

13:02.858 --> 13:04.426
- No, it doesn't, actually.

13:04.493 --> 13:06.094
I think we should watch
another video right now.

13:06.162 --> 13:08.930
One that your company made
30 years ago.

13:11.100 --> 13:14.202
- I'm nick newport,
president of sweetums,

13:14.270 --> 13:17.239
Giving you a look inside
our corn syrup factory.

13:17.306 --> 13:20.475
This is all-new high-fructose
corn syrup,

13:20.543 --> 13:22.544
A miracle product
that's sweeter than sugar,

13:22.612 --> 13:24.713
But cheaper to produce.

13:24.780 --> 13:27.215
Cheap, delicious,
sugary corn

13:27.283 --> 13:29.451
Is currently being used
by farms

13:29.518 --> 13:31.319
To fatten up their cows
and pigs.

13:31.387 --> 13:33.655
Look how fat those cows are!

13:33.723 --> 13:36.591
Fat, happy, and docile.

13:36.659 --> 13:38.793
The way we like 'em.

13:38.861 --> 13:40.462
- [clears throat]

13:40.529 --> 13:42.964
So you still want to claim
that corn syrup is healthy?

13:43.032 --> 13:45.600
- Corn syrup is natural
and it's fine in moderation.

13:45.668 --> 13:47.435
But don't take my word
for it.

13:47.503 --> 13:50.538
Ladies and gentlemen,
mr. Nick newport, jr.!

13:50.606 --> 13:52.540
[cheers and applause]

13:52.608 --> 13:54.909
- Hey, guy.
Hey, how you doing?

13:54.977 --> 13:59.381
How you doing?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:59.448 --> 14:02.017
- My kids,
denver and dakota!

14:02.084 --> 14:05.020
[cheers and applause]

14:09.091 --> 14:10.425
- Ah!
- [giggling]

14:10.493 --> 14:14.062
- I just want to get a--
ah, that's good hose water.

14:14.130 --> 14:15.463
- Hey.
- Don't get my shoes.

14:15.531 --> 14:17.632
Hey, what's up, guys.
You come to help tom move too?

14:17.700 --> 14:19.801
Too late! We already
almost got all of it.

14:19.869 --> 14:21.803
- No. We just thought
it'd be funny

14:21.871 --> 14:23.471
To see April
doing physical labor.

14:23.539 --> 14:25.507
- [snickers] ah.

14:25.574 --> 14:26.875
It's been an awesome
moving day.

14:26.942 --> 14:29.678
I got the little robot
to play dave matthews.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.012
* oh, little baby *

14:31.080 --> 14:33.848
- What's he talking about?
- Dj roomba.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.717
- What?
- All right.

14:35.785 --> 14:37.852
Back to the grindstone.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.155
Awesome seeing you, dudes.
- See ya.

14:40.222 --> 14:44.025
- Later, bro.
- Ha ha!

14:44.093 --> 14:46.861
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:46.929 --> 14:51.700
- God, this is so weird.
It's like, end of an era, huh?

14:51.767 --> 14:53.568
It's kinda sad.

14:53.636 --> 14:55.704
- Eh, we'll still be friends.
- Yeah.

14:55.771 --> 14:57.539
Well, hey, you guys
must be starving.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.140
You want me to order you a pizza
or something?

14:59.208 --> 15:00.542
- Oh, that'd be great. Yeah.
- Okay.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.243
- Why don't you get
some canadian bacon on it

15:02.311 --> 15:03.645
Since you're from canada...
- Mm-hmm.

15:03.713 --> 15:05.947
- And sausage
'cause I am brown and spicy.

15:06.015 --> 15:08.416
- [laughs] okay.
All right.

15:08.484 --> 15:12.687
Well, I will, um, see you
around, I guess, right?

15:12.755 --> 15:16.624
- Yeah. I'm around.
- I'll see you around.

15:16.692 --> 15:18.126
[chuckles]
- bye.

15:18.194 --> 15:23.031
- Bye.

15:23.099 --> 15:26.768
- Wow. Mr. Newport, jr.,
thank you so much for coming.

15:26.836 --> 15:28.937
But don't you think
that every person

15:29.004 --> 15:30.605
Has the right to know
what they're putting

15:30.673 --> 15:31.740
In their bodies?

15:31.807 --> 15:33.375
Right, everybody?
- Is shoelace here?

15:33.442 --> 15:35.009
Where's shoelace?

15:35.077 --> 15:36.077
- Shoelace couldn't make it.

15:36.145 --> 15:37.812
But I do agree
with this nice lady.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.982
That's why I say we should let
the people be the judge.

15:41.050 --> 15:42.083
Denver.

15:42.151 --> 15:44.419
- Everybody, check under
your seats!

15:44.487 --> 15:48.022
[gasps and cheers]

15:48.090 --> 15:52.227
[whistling and applause]

15:54.797 --> 15:57.332
- Denver, you little son
of a bitch.

16:01.588 --> 16:05.157
[hip-hop playing]
- mm.

16:05.987 --> 16:08.622
There's no pizza left?
- Sorry, jer. Too slow.

16:08.690 --> 16:10.491
- You want my crusts?
Here. Take this.

16:10.558 --> 16:13.827
- Nobody even told me
the pizza was here.

16:13.895 --> 16:14.862
[crash]

16:14.929 --> 16:17.498
- Jerry! You stepped
on dj roomba!

16:17.565 --> 16:19.867
Agh!
- That was an accident.

16:19.934 --> 16:22.035
- You killed him.
I built him myself.

16:22.103 --> 16:24.071
He was like a son to me.

16:24.139 --> 16:26.306
- Okay. Time to vote.

16:26.374 --> 16:28.976
All those who would like
the bloated corpse

16:29.043 --> 16:30.410
Of the government
to keep running

16:30.478 --> 16:33.480
The snack bars
at taxpayer expense,

16:33.548 --> 16:34.882
Raise your hands.

16:34.949 --> 16:37.117
- That seems like an unfair
phrasing.

16:37.185 --> 16:39.319
And all those in favor

16:39.387 --> 16:41.755
Of letting this heartless
corporation, sweetums,

16:41.823 --> 16:43.557
Stuff your children
with sugary crap,

16:43.625 --> 16:44.791
Raise your hand.

16:44.859 --> 16:48.428
- [laughs]
thank you, everybody.

16:48.496 --> 16:51.064
- Ugh.
I can't believe this.

16:51.132 --> 16:52.733
- You know what,
we did our job.

16:52.800 --> 16:56.803
We informed the public.
That's all we can do.

16:56.871 --> 16:58.539
- I'm sorry, man,
there's nothing I can do.

16:58.606 --> 16:59.940
- [sighs] are you serious?

17:00.008 --> 17:02.309
- Look, we'll get it fixed
and I'll see you Monday.

17:02.377 --> 17:04.810
- I just got off the phone
with my new landlord.

17:04.878 --> 17:07.281
Apparently there's been
some sort of gas leak

17:07.348 --> 17:11.218
And I can't move into my place
until Monday now.

17:11.286 --> 17:12.953
- Are you telling us
we have to unload this

17:13.021 --> 17:14.021
And move it back
in the house?

17:14.088 --> 17:15.489
- No. I can't put it there.

17:15.557 --> 17:17.357
I promised wendy
I'd be out of here tonight.

17:17.425 --> 17:21.395
Um...I got it!

17:21.462 --> 17:22.996
Everybody go home.

17:23.064 --> 17:25.299
Pack away my stuff
in your own houses.

17:25.366 --> 17:27.935
Then on Monday,
pack it back up,

17:28.002 --> 17:30.370
Meet me at my new place,
unload it there.

17:32.540 --> 17:36.343
- [sighs]
come on, guys.

17:36.411 --> 17:39.213
- See ya, tom.
- Bye.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.248
- Later.

17:41.316 --> 17:43.650
- Hey, bro, want to go get
our grub on?

17:43.718 --> 17:45.619
- Totes, bra.
Wings and brews.

17:45.687 --> 17:46.954
- Why are you guys talking
like that?

17:47.021 --> 17:49.823
- Just chillaxin'
like your new bro andy.

17:49.891 --> 17:51.491
- Yeah. Want to play
some hacky sack later?

17:51.559 --> 17:53.527
Maybe, uh, listen
to blues traveler?

17:53.595 --> 17:55.996
- Okay. I'm leaving.
- We're just kidding.

17:56.064 --> 17:58.165
Let's go to dinner.
- I'm not hungry.

17:58.233 --> 17:59.866
And you guys
aren't being funny.

17:59.934 --> 18:00.934
- Why are you being weird?

18:01.002 --> 18:02.069
We make fun of people
like that.

18:02.136 --> 18:04.671
That's what we do.

18:04.739 --> 18:09.142
- You know, for a gay couple,
you guys are being really gay.

18:09.210 --> 18:10.744
- I said
"of course I remember you.

18:10.812 --> 18:12.079
You're chastity, right?"

18:12.146 --> 18:13.914
[laughter]

18:13.982 --> 18:16.950
- Leslie. Even though
I didn't invite you,

18:17.018 --> 18:18.318
You came here anyway.

18:18.386 --> 18:21.088
I-I respect that
because you made a choice

18:21.155 --> 18:22.823
As a free american.

18:22.890 --> 18:24.324
- What are you eating?

18:24.392 --> 18:26.660
- I call this
"turf and turf."

18:26.728 --> 18:27.728
It's a 16-ounce t-bone

18:27.795 --> 18:29.730
And a 24-ounce porterhouse.

18:29.797 --> 18:32.666
Also whiskey and a cigar.

18:32.734 --> 18:35.068
I'm gonna consume
all of this at the same time

18:35.136 --> 18:37.070
Because I am
a free american.

18:37.138 --> 18:40.540
- No cigars inside, sir.
- Fine.

18:40.608 --> 18:42.709
I will smoke
the entire thing outside.

18:42.777 --> 18:45.879
Even though it is bad for me,
I am going to do it.

18:45.947 --> 18:48.148
- Why is he being
such an ass?

18:48.216 --> 18:51.218
- Oh, it's a long story.
- Yaah!

18:51.286 --> 18:53.053
It's freezing outside.

18:53.121 --> 18:54.988
So I will not be smoking
this cigar.

18:55.056 --> 18:57.991
But rest assured, I could
if I wanted to because this--

18:58.059 --> 19:00.127
- This is america, right?
Is it?

19:00.194 --> 19:02.396
May I speak with you,
please?

19:02.463 --> 19:05.565
Look, I don't know if you're
being a jerk on purpose

19:05.633 --> 19:07.601
Just to prove you have the right
to be a jerk,

19:07.669 --> 19:09.002
But either way,
you're being a jerk.

19:09.070 --> 19:11.338
So here,
take the booze chart.

19:11.406 --> 19:12.673
- You kidding me?
- No.

19:12.740 --> 19:14.441
If you're gonna drink,
you should use it, okay?

19:14.509 --> 19:16.343
I'm gonna head out.

19:16.411 --> 19:18.612
By the way,
maybe it's none of my business,

19:18.680 --> 19:20.881
But if you eat three pounds
of steak every day,

19:20.948 --> 19:22.449
You're gonna die.

19:22.517 --> 19:25.118
And although I've already
written your eulogy,

19:25.186 --> 19:27.187
And it's incredibly
touching,

19:27.255 --> 19:30.757
I would prefer not to give it
for a while.

19:30.825 --> 19:32.659
The first line,
by the way,

19:32.727 --> 19:37.397
"o captain! My captain!
Ron swanson, a swan song."

19:37.465 --> 19:41.768
Yeah. And it gets better
from there!

19:46.240 --> 19:49.543
- April. April.

19:49.610 --> 19:50.711
You want to watch me
rollerblade

19:50.778 --> 19:52.045
In the parking lot
after work?

19:52.113 --> 19:53.947
I'm pretty awesome.
I used to be really good.

19:54.015 --> 19:55.716
That was, like,
70 pounds ago.

19:55.783 --> 19:58.518
- I can't.
I'm kind of busy.

19:58.586 --> 20:01.888
- Aw, that's lame.
Tomorrow.

20:01.956 --> 20:07.027
- Maybe. I don't know.

20:07.095 --> 20:09.329
- Okay. Bye.

20:09.397 --> 20:11.998
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

20:12.066 --> 20:16.503
Just kidding.
I don't fall. Hee-hee.

20:18.239 --> 20:20.640
- I, uh...

20:21.843 --> 20:23.276
What are you eating?

20:23.344 --> 20:24.644
- I didn't have time
to have breakfast.

20:24.712 --> 20:27.247
- I'm gonna toss these
in the dumpster outside

20:27.315 --> 20:30.717
And I don't want to see you
digging around in there later.

20:34.922 --> 20:39.626
I am sorry.
I have been a horse's ass.

20:41.028 --> 20:42.696
And...

20:42.764 --> 20:44.798
That is the end
of what I have to say.

20:44.866 --> 20:46.633
- Apology accepted.

20:50.905 --> 20:54.841
Put a coat on,
it's freezing outside.

20:54.841 --> 20:56.841

jerry.

21:01.600 --> 21:05.936
Jerry!

21:06.004 --> 21:10.674
This is the ghost
of dj roomba.

21:10.742 --> 21:12.810
Why did you kill me?

21:12.877 --> 21:15.479
I'm gonna haunt you, jerry.

21:15.547 --> 21:18.382
I'm gonna follow you
and play the black eyed peas

21:18.450 --> 21:20.351
On a nonstop loop.

21:20.418 --> 21:22.586
- * let's burn the roof *

21:22.654 --> 21:24.955
- * and then we'll do it
again *

21:25.023 --> 21:26.156
- * let's do it *

21:26.224 --> 21:27.558
* let's do it,
let's do it *
