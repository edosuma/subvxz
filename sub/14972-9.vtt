00:01.002 --> 00:02.151
Previously on Van Helsing

00:02.152 --> 00:03.301
I am going to find you.

00:03.304 --> 00:04.370
Do my bidding.

00:04.372 --> 00:06.105
Your life can be good.

00:06.107 --> 00:07.806
I need to get this woman
to the base.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.141
That's what I'm going to do.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.109
This is my file.

00:10.111 --> 00:10.876
It's empty.

00:10.878 --> 00:11.810
Gorman Jones.

00:11.812 --> 00:12.778
I hid out here.

00:12.780 --> 00:13.879
I heard you guys coming.

00:13.881 --> 00:14.980
We can't defend this place.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.115
Then what do you suggest?

00:16.117 --> 00:17.249
They call this place "the farm".

00:17.251 --> 00:18.851
( Screaming )

00:18.853 --> 00:20.753
This is the only way in or out
of this place.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.121
( Screaming )

00:22.123 --> 00:23.422
I was trying to kiss her!

00:23.424 --> 00:24.423
What the hell!!!!

00:24.425 --> 00:25.724
It looks like Cynthia's finger.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.159
Don't make me do this!!!

02:28.549 --> 02:31.216
Hey, no, no!

02:31.218 --> 02:33.452
We got that.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.189
Morning, by the way.

02:39.326 --> 02:40.692
All wrapped up
and ready to go?

02:40.694 --> 02:42.361
Let's get this piece of shit
in the grave.

02:46.700 --> 02:50.502
Oh for god sake, I'm sorry
i called him a piece of shit,

02:50.504 --> 02:52.204
can you help me out?

02:52.206 --> 02:54.540
I am kind of looking forward
to puking my guts up here.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.942
I had a couple of beers
hitting the bunk.

02:58.712 --> 03:04.550
I had to kill him, right?

03:04.552 --> 03:06.318
I mean, there was no choice.

03:06.320 --> 03:10.656
We all saw that he did
it...He had the finger!

03:10.658 --> 03:15.761
Hey, look you did
what you had to do.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.262
You can't let this mess
with you.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.965
Not here, not now.

03:19.967 --> 03:23.902
Listen to me, you're good.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.804
Okay.

03:25.806 --> 03:30.242
Come on, one, two three.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.427
No ashes to ashes for you,
John boy --

03:48.429 --> 03:50.862
Axel you ever heard of
respecting the dead?

03:50.864 --> 03:52.331
What, like he did?

03:52.333 --> 03:53.832
Cutting off people's fingers
after they died?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.867
He doesn't deserve shit.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.708
That's nice.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.276
All the rotten eggs.

04:04.278 --> 04:05.644
That's a shame.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.312
I could use a crazy breakfast
to kick this hangover

04:07.314 --> 04:08.947
in the ass.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.049
I thought marines
could hold your liquor...

04:11.051 --> 04:13.185
Back in the day --

04:13.187 --> 04:15.087
wouldn't worry too much
about him.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.688
It might not be over.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.723
Might thaw him out
in the future...

04:17.725 --> 04:20.058
Once they've found
a cure for asshole.

04:20.060 --> 04:23.228
( Laughs )

04:23.230 --> 04:25.564
There you go --
you're smiling.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.132
Now you're human.

04:27.134 --> 04:30.802
Hey, Axel,

04:30.804 --> 04:34.206
whatever happens,
thanks for getting us this far.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.807
Just doing my duty --

04:35.809 --> 04:37.476
you keep saying it's your
'mission' and everything,

04:37.478 --> 04:41.146
but I know what's going down.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.618
Oh, Christ!

04:46.620 --> 04:48.086
Oh, god! What is that?

04:48.088 --> 04:51.256
( Coughing )

04:51.258 --> 04:52.724
Freezer must've gone
bust months ago.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.393
Oh, man!

05:05.673 --> 05:07.606
Jesus Christ!

05:07.608 --> 05:09.574
That's not good.

05:34.335 --> 05:36.101
Okay if I bunk with you?

05:36.103 --> 05:39.037
This place gives me
the creeps.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.639
Of course.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.213
Dead guys can't hurt you,
you know.

05:48.215 --> 05:52.351
There's more and more
of 'em every day.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.486
You did the right thing.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.288
That guy was going
to kill me.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.390
You saved me from another
drunk asshole.

05:58.392 --> 06:01.093
Just like the old days.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.962
The old days.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.998
You see me lose my shit
back then --

06:07.000 --> 06:08.400
I go mental out of nowhere.

06:08.402 --> 06:09.835
For nothing.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.703
Not for nothing.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.171
No -- but

06:13.173 --> 06:16.675
but what?

06:16.677 --> 06:19.644
I wanted to do it.

06:19.646 --> 06:25.484
Last night, and before --
i wanted to kill.

06:25.486 --> 06:29.087
I couldn't wait
to do it again...

06:29.089 --> 06:34.760
Well, like my dad always
used to say --

06:34.762 --> 06:37.262
life's good when you enjoy
your work.

06:37.264 --> 06:41.466
( Laughs )

06:41.468 --> 06:45.237
Remember I used to tell you
about my folk's farm?

06:45.239 --> 06:46.972
It's not far from here.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.840
On the way to Denver.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.876
The woods are full of deer

06:50.878 --> 06:55.180
mom's jam and pickled beets

06:55.182 --> 06:59.117
disgusting.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.486
Dad's probably sitting
on the porch right now.

07:01.488 --> 07:06.792
Picking off vampires two
at a time, eating 'em raw,

07:06.794 --> 07:10.328
right off the bone --

07:10.330 --> 07:12.531
tough old buzzard.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.500
Like to see 'em try and take
that one down --

07:15.502 --> 07:18.470
( laughs )

07:18.472 --> 07:19.971
I always loved that about you

07:19.973 --> 07:21.039
how you could laugh

07:21.041 --> 07:23.341
even though everything
was shit.

07:23.343 --> 07:27.379
Everything's always shit.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.581
Unless I'm with you.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.832
Hey...

07:50.671 --> 07:52.170
You should rest.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.284
Yeah.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.408
The organs might
tell us something.

08:30.410 --> 08:31.743
They are not going to tell
us who put those bodies

08:31.745 --> 08:34.779
in the freezer
and where they went.

08:34.781 --> 08:39.317
I'll prepare some slides, see
if on a cellular level I can--

08:39.319 --> 08:40.151
oh.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.587
What? You see something?

08:42.589 --> 08:44.456
Oh...

08:44.458 --> 08:46.725
( Vomits )

08:49.930 --> 08:50.929
You okay, doc?

08:50.931 --> 08:53.098
I'm fine, I'm fine.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.601
Here.

08:56.603 --> 08:57.836
It's okay.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.907
I feel so stupid.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.074
I don't normally drink.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.776
I'm so sorry.

09:04.778 --> 09:09.481
Don't. Please.

09:09.483 --> 09:11.650
Thank you.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.855
We should get the rest out
of those bodies out of there

09:16.857 --> 09:22.761
if there is a virus or something
that might be airborne.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.195
Put them into the quarantine
zone.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.698
Through those sealed doors.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.732
That'll be safer

09:27.734 --> 09:29.134
sure. No problem.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.835
Yeah, I can help.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.938
Nah, nah, that's good. I got it.

09:39.413 --> 09:42.180
Hey!

09:42.182 --> 09:43.048
Oh...

09:43.050 --> 09:44.849
Hey.

09:47.654 --> 09:48.486
Uh... it's nothing.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.588
Dead body run.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.290
Don't worry about it. I got it.

10:01.468 --> 10:03.735
( Coughs )

10:06.506 --> 10:08.440
Ugh!!!

10:11.011 --> 10:14.212
So Susan, huh?

10:14.214 --> 10:15.413
We're friends.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.215
Special friends, it looks like.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.316
You wish.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.185
Yeah, kinda do.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.593
Listen, I just wanted to...

10:32.399 --> 10:33.965
Yeah, what?

10:33.967 --> 10:38.103
I wanted to say thank you
for having my back,

10:38.105 --> 10:40.805
for being someone I could trust.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.941
Okay.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.609
There aren't a lot of people
in my life like that,

10:44.611 --> 10:48.580
especially men so thank you.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.782
Thank you.

10:50.784 --> 10:54.285
It's cool.

10:54.287 --> 10:59.290
The trust might be kind of
stupid, though, these days.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.291
What?

11:00.293 --> 11:02.560
Not with me, just in general.

11:02.562 --> 11:05.030
The apocalypse.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.998
Anyway, I got this cart of
rotting corpses

11:07.000 --> 11:08.733
so I am going to
take care of this.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.403
We'll chat some more later.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.641
Trust is stupid.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.617
How am I going to make
this work?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.954
Why is trust stupid?

11:36.630 --> 11:39.431
I stole your file,
back at the base.

11:39.433 --> 11:43.234
I read the whole thing.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.636
What?

11:44.638 --> 11:45.603
I'm sorry.

11:45.605 --> 11:46.971
I stood guard over you
for three years.

11:46.973 --> 11:51.509
I figured I deserved
to know why.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.012
What did it say?

11:54.014 --> 11:56.114
Not that much.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.384
About your childhood, mostly...

11:59.386 --> 12:01.186
Some forms having to do with
your mother giving you up.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.021
My mom died in childbirth.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.323
She didn't give me up.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.259
I grew up with foster parents.

12:08.261 --> 12:11.696
Okay.

12:11.698 --> 12:15.100
What else did it say?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.135
Nothing.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.871
Just some military stuff,
it's all blacked out.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.806
Even your real name
is blacked out.

12:21.808 --> 12:22.640
Where is the file, Axel?

12:22.642 --> 12:23.675
Give me the goddamn file?

12:23.677 --> 12:26.878
I left it back at the base.

12:30.083 --> 12:35.720
Come on, hey, open the door
Vanessa!

12:35.722 --> 12:37.789
Come on let me out!

12:37.791 --> 12:39.891
Come on open the door!

12:44.664 --> 12:47.065
( Gunfire )

12:47.067 --> 12:48.399
Shut it!

12:51.505 --> 12:55.006
Where the hell
did he come from?

13:30.177 --> 13:33.278
Hello?

13:33.280 --> 13:36.514
Who's there?

13:36.516 --> 13:38.683
Is it one of you?

13:46.426 --> 13:49.394
Look, I'm not going to hurt
you or anything.

13:49.396 --> 13:53.698
I just saw you and followed you.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.967
You should go now.

13:55.969 --> 13:59.204
Look, I'm not going to leave
you here by yourself and shit.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.840
Let me at least protect you
or something.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.277
You look hungry.

14:18.491 --> 14:22.961
Here, want some?

14:22.963 --> 14:25.864
They're just nuts and berries.

14:33.340 --> 14:36.174
You know, you are
bat-shit crazy

14:36.176 --> 14:38.209
for staying here by yourself.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.545
I could've killed you
in seconds.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.547
I'm collecting things
for medicine.

14:42.549 --> 14:46.184
So I've got to forage.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.287
You thought I was a feeder
back there, didn't you?

14:49.289 --> 14:52.190
And you tried talking to it?

14:52.192 --> 14:54.726
You'd have been screwed.

14:54.728 --> 14:55.860
Not necessarily.

14:55.862 --> 14:58.563
Ah, yes necessarily.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.365
No doubt.

15:04.971 --> 15:08.273
I know a place where
there's mushrooms.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.643
They love the darkness
and the ash.

15:11.645 --> 15:13.778
Wanna come?

15:13.780 --> 15:17.548
I'm 'Emma,' by the way...

15:17.550 --> 15:18.716
Absolutely.

15:18.718 --> 15:21.052
I'm 'mohamad.'

15:41.775 --> 15:42.607
he's dragging a leg --

15:42.609 --> 15:45.276
must have got hit
by a land mine.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.832
Looks like he was blind too.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.668
Eyes were seared right out
of his head.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.669
Huh?

16:13.907 --> 16:17.375
What's going on with you
and Vanessa?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.510
Oh, you know...

16:22.882 --> 16:23.848
Nothing near as much fun

16:23.850 --> 16:25.950
as what's going on with you
and Vanessa.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.018
Shut up!

16:27.020 --> 16:29.821
( Laughs )

16:29.823 --> 16:32.590
You're such a dick.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.492
Yeah, I know.

16:44.471 --> 16:49.040
Holy shit!

16:49.042 --> 16:52.777
What the hell is this place?

16:52.779 --> 16:56.280
I don't know and I don't
want to know.

17:06.126 --> 17:09.994
Blood trail looks like
it's dried up.

17:09.996 --> 17:14.399
Must have healed.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.967
I say the hell with it.

17:15.969 --> 17:17.001
Let's close up in here.

17:17.003 --> 17:19.537
Button is only on one side
of that door anyway.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.206
Are you sure it can't get
back to the other side?

17:22.208 --> 17:25.510
Baby, I'm not sure of nothing.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.237
Traitors.

17:53.239 --> 17:57.408
There are traitors
in our midst.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.378
They would create chaos,

18:00.380 --> 18:04.549
upset the balance that keeps
us all safe and alive.

18:04.551 --> 18:07.285
We cannot allow it.

18:07.287 --> 18:11.589
But many of these traitors
have now been caught and purged.

18:11.591 --> 18:17.395
All thanks to this woman...
Quaid.

18:17.397 --> 18:21.432
She should be an example
to you all.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.635
Cooperate and live.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.672
Resist and die.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.811
( Muffled grunts )

18:39.586 --> 18:41.252
Go.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.056
They won't believe your lie.

18:45.058 --> 18:49.594
It's your word against mine.

18:49.596 --> 18:54.632
You cannot see their eyes
like I can...

18:54.634 --> 18:57.902
Their minds are already made up.

19:03.943 --> 19:12.884
( Whimpering )

19:35.008 --> 19:38.209
( Sighs )

19:43.650 --> 19:45.850
Oh god...

20:19.052 --> 20:21.285
Where is it? Where is it?

20:45.511 --> 20:51.282
( Beeping )

20:56.089 --> 20:58.089
( Vomits )

21:01.894 --> 21:04.362
Axel... Axel...

21:17.810 --> 21:19.977
We've checked the hallway
but didn't find it.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.545
You said it was blinded?

21:21.547 --> 21:22.947
Yeah, eyes blasted out
of its head.

21:22.949 --> 21:23.648
That's not changing.

21:23.650 --> 21:24.749
But the leg healed.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.417
So it's pissed --it's in pain --

21:26.419 --> 21:28.319
and it's somewhere in here
ready to strike.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.620
That's great.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.389
We've got to flush it out
one way or the other.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.124
Not if those doors work...

21:33.126 --> 21:36.394
Or if there's some other way
back in over here.

21:36.396 --> 21:37.628
That's a big 'if.'

21:37.630 --> 21:38.596
well, how'd it get in here,
anyway?

21:38.598 --> 21:40.631
Stairway's collapsed

21:40.633 --> 21:41.465
I don't know.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.467
Could've been in here
for weeks...

21:43.469 --> 21:44.969
Where's doc?

21:44.971 --> 21:45.703
Still shut up in the lab,

21:45.705 --> 21:47.104
working on that soldier,
i guess.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.572
You left her there alone?!!

21:48.574 --> 21:50.107
I'm not the one that let.
A feral in here!

21:50.109 --> 21:52.310
Neither am I, dipshit!

21:55.281 --> 21:57.815
I'll find that mother sucker.

22:01.220 --> 22:01.919
<i> Doc!!</i>

22:01.921 --> 22:03.654
( Pounding on door )

22:03.656 --> 22:05.523
<i> Doc!!</i>

22:05.525 --> 22:08.159
( Pounding on door )

22:08.161 --> 22:11.762
<i> Come on, I need you to open</i>
<i> the door now!!!</i>

22:11.764 --> 22:12.997
<i> Come on, I need you--</i>

22:12.999 --> 22:14.298
Axel!

22:14.300 --> 22:16.167
<i>You got to unlock the door, doc.</i>

22:16.169 --> 22:18.703
( Moaning )

22:18.705 --> 22:22.039
( Pounding on door )

22:22.041 --> 22:23.974
<i> There you go, there you go.</i>

22:23.976 --> 22:25.843
Axel!!

22:25.845 --> 22:29.013
Whoa, whoa, what
the hell is going on?

22:29.015 --> 22:31.148
It's radiation.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.750
It's radiation!

22:32.752 --> 22:35.086
This whole place
is contaminated.

22:35.088 --> 22:35.953
What?

22:35.955 --> 22:38.589
These soldiers must've
holed up in here

22:38.591 --> 22:40.324
when their base fell...

22:40.326 --> 22:42.126
Until the radiation
got them.

22:42.128 --> 22:45.896
Axel...What is this place?

22:45.898 --> 22:47.898
The guys called it
'the farm.'

22:47.900 --> 22:50.835
they said they did 'experiments'
here, that's all I know.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.136
I promise you.

22:52.138 --> 22:54.305
Yeah, if we don't get
out of this place...

22:54.307 --> 22:55.005
How could we do that?

22:55.007 --> 22:56.374
The front door caved in.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.908
I...

22:57.910 --> 23:00.177
Maybe it's time to start
digging...

23:00.179 --> 23:01.645
You're kidding me?

23:01.647 --> 23:03.381
We gotta be 50 feet
down...At least.

23:03.383 --> 23:06.617
You got a better idea?

23:06.619 --> 23:09.820
Maybe you can steal a pick-axe
and a shovel from someone...

23:15.928 --> 23:19.029
What the hell was that
all about?

23:19.031 --> 23:20.398
Nothing.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.165
...ok...

23:21.167 --> 23:22.533
Listen to me.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.001
You're sure about the...?

23:24.003 --> 23:25.403
Dead sure.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.405
As in 'dead.'

23:27.407 --> 23:29.173
we've got to get out of
this place right now

23:29.175 --> 23:32.643
or we'll all die...Soon.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.211
Ok.

23:38.017 --> 23:41.886
Everything and everyone in
this place is contaminated.

23:41.888 --> 23:44.588
Here. Take these
iodine tablets.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.257
What's caused it, doc,
do we know?

23:46.259 --> 23:47.258
Isotopes, maybe.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.326
Radioactive particles
used to alter DNA.

23:49.328 --> 23:51.462
Something they were doing
down here...

23:51.464 --> 23:54.098
In this place called 'the farm.'

23:54.100 --> 23:56.066
more like a slaughterhouse...

23:56.068 --> 23:58.169
Axel and I found this room
covered in blood...

23:58.171 --> 23:59.770
Didn't look like vampires.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.039
I think it was those tests
he was talking about.

24:02.041 --> 24:04.575
Yeah, you wanna elaborate
on that, Axel?

24:04.577 --> 24:06.444
I don't know any more about
this place than you do.

24:06.446 --> 24:07.745
I wonder...

24:07.747 --> 24:09.947
You wanted to bring us
down here pretty badly...

24:09.949 --> 24:11.415
Yeah, because I thought it
was safe.

24:11.417 --> 24:12.216
Right.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.418
Yeah right.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.256
How much time do we have,
doc?

24:19.258 --> 24:20.558
I don't know.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.826
The iodine will keep us
feeling better

24:21.828 --> 24:24.462
until we run out of it.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.931
But the geiger counter's
reading 6 units.

24:26.933 --> 24:29.233
If it gets to 10 we'll die
a slow and painful death

24:29.235 --> 24:30.901
whether we get out or not.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.069
Ha!

24:32.071 --> 24:35.105
God, you're always such a
ray of sunshine, aren't you?

24:35.107 --> 24:37.241
I'm just telling it as it is.

24:37.243 --> 24:40.244
Yeah, with such care
and compassion --

24:40.246 --> 24:43.214
sometimes I wonder if you're not
still just a little bit—

24:43.216 --> 24:44.081
what?

24:44.083 --> 24:44.982
You know.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.617
Say it!

24:46.619 --> 24:48.252
Vampire.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.955
You are going to say
that to me?!!!

24:50.957 --> 24:51.822
You!!!

24:51.824 --> 24:53.224
And you are just so calm
and collected

24:53.226 --> 24:54.925
telling us how we're
going to die!!!!

24:54.927 --> 24:56.160
Screw you!!!!!

24:56.162 --> 24:57.161
Take it down a notch.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.562
I'll do what I want, thanks!

24:58.564 --> 24:59.930
Stop!

24:59.932 --> 25:01.632
Enough!

25:01.634 --> 25:03.200
Sam's right.

25:03.202 --> 25:06.670
We're all just sick and bitchy,
so let's not...

25:06.672 --> 25:08.506
You don't seem sick at all.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.407
What do you mean?

25:10.409 --> 25:12.810
Radiation is not affecting you?

25:12.812 --> 25:15.179
You know something,
don't you?

25:15.181 --> 25:16.380
It's just an observation.

25:16.382 --> 25:18.782
Axel...Tell me what
you know!

25:18.784 --> 25:20.618
I don't know shit--

25:24.257 --> 25:27.691
maybe you're the next step
in this whole evolutionary mess,

25:27.693 --> 25:29.560
part us, part them --

25:29.562 --> 25:33.631
able to survive whatever
this dying planet throws at you.

25:51.984 --> 25:55.853
Mushrooms, some kinds of
moss, lots of roots.

25:55.855 --> 25:58.055
Not everything died.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.126
No! Spit that out!

26:02.128 --> 26:04.795
Some people are allergic
to those ones!

26:09.869 --> 26:14.171
You can't survive like this.

26:14.173 --> 26:17.841
Like, where do you
even live?

26:17.843 --> 26:20.444
You wanna see?

26:31.390 --> 26:32.556
It's okay.

26:32.558 --> 26:35.225
No, no, it really isn't.

26:45.237 --> 26:47.137
( Whispers ) Wait! Emma!

26:49.976 --> 26:52.176
Goddammit.

27:01.587 --> 27:02.586
Taka!

27:02.588 --> 27:05.789
Don't ever say my name!

27:05.791 --> 27:07.124
It's a lie --

27:07.126 --> 27:08.559
I had nothing
to do with their ambush.

27:08.561 --> 27:10.561
I would never betray
the cause --

27:10.563 --> 27:11.295
Campbell knows...

27:11.297 --> 27:13.230
Campbell's dead.

27:15.101 --> 27:18.636
They all are.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.137
Because of you.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.840
You're playing straight
into her hands.

27:22.842 --> 27:26.143
The feeders want us to turn
against each other.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.480
Wipe out your cell,
the ones on the outside.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.048
If we kill each other,

27:31.050 --> 27:34.084
there's fewer for them
to turn or feed...

27:34.086 --> 27:37.655
Don't you see that?

27:37.657 --> 27:39.123
Just what did you tell them?

27:39.125 --> 27:39.923
Not a word.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.258
I swear.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.527
She's lying.

27:43.529 --> 27:45.429
She must be.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.997
Sheema?

27:46.999 --> 27:49.233
You're alive?

27:49.235 --> 27:52.269
They took me.

27:52.271 --> 27:55.172
They tortured me.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.744
So why didn't they hurt her?

28:08.454 --> 28:10.854
I would never tell
them anything.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.423
No matter what they did
to me.

28:12.425 --> 28:13.323
It's her...Sheema!

28:13.325 --> 28:15.325
She's the one...!

28:15.327 --> 28:16.827
I would do anything
for the cause.

28:16.829 --> 28:17.594
You know that.

28:17.596 --> 28:18.829
( Gunfire )

28:21.133 --> 28:23.033
I do now.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.837
Get word to the outside.

28:26.839 --> 28:29.840
We've been compromised.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.376
Have someone tend
to those wounds.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.978
Then we'll talk.

28:52.531 --> 28:59.737
( Sobbing )

29:11.350 --> 29:12.850
Jesus Christ --

29:12.852 --> 29:14.184
can't I have five minutes?

29:14.186 --> 29:16.787
I just want to be alone.

29:16.789 --> 29:19.089
What is your problem?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.457
You want to know?

29:20.459 --> 29:23.527
Yeah.

29:23.529 --> 29:27.431
I didn't try and save smitty.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.032
What?

29:29.034 --> 29:30.400
The day I was bit?

29:30.402 --> 29:32.069
I was trying to shut
the door on him.

29:32.071 --> 29:35.172
I panicked, okay?

29:35.174 --> 29:37.708
I saw the vampire coming and i
was trying to keep them out,

29:37.710 --> 29:39.409
both of them out,
i didn't care...

29:39.411 --> 29:40.844
I was just trying
to save myself.

29:40.846 --> 29:42.579
That's it.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.114
I'm no hero.

29:44.116 --> 29:48.285
And I can't stand you looking at
me every single day like I am.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.420
I'm a horrible person.

29:50.422 --> 29:51.388
I'm a coward.

29:51.390 --> 29:52.222
No, you're not.

29:52.224 --> 29:52.956
I am a coward.

29:52.958 --> 29:53.791
No, you're not.

29:53.793 --> 29:55.726
I am a coward.

29:55.728 --> 30:02.499
You are not a coward,
okay and you're not a liar.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.001
What?

30:04.003 --> 30:07.037
You never said you tried
to save him.

30:07.039 --> 30:11.141
I put that on you.

30:11.143 --> 30:15.479
Look, we've all done some
terrible shit.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.414
I know I have.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.083
That old lady at the hospital,
that poor son of a bitch

30:20.085 --> 30:23.921
I stabbed to death
with a screwdriver.

30:23.923 --> 30:28.959
All that bad stuff
that's not who you are.

30:28.961 --> 30:31.261
Not in this world.

30:31.263 --> 30:35.265
In this world we do what we
gotta do to survive.

30:35.267 --> 30:39.102
And that's it.

30:39.104 --> 30:42.973
I'm sorry...What have
we become.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.174
It's okay.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.776
( Sobbing )

30:45.778 --> 30:48.245
I wish I'd saved him.

30:48.247 --> 30:52.416
I wish I had saved him!

30:52.418 --> 30:54.985
<i> I am so sorry.</i>

30:54.987 --> 30:58.956
( Sobbing )

31:00.926 --> 31:02.259
Have you guys seen gorman?

31:02.261 --> 31:04.394
He didn't take his iodine.

31:04.396 --> 31:08.532
No, I haven't seen the guy
since last time I was in here.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.367
Yeah, me neither.

31:25.618 --> 31:27.851
Jesus Christ, Sam.
What the hell?

31:42.801 --> 31:44.635
Holy shit!

31:48.774 --> 31:51.208
Well, at least I know
how that thing got in here...

31:51.210 --> 31:54.511
More than that, I think we just
got our lives back...

31:54.513 --> 31:57.447
( Laughter )

32:05.925 --> 32:07.391
...last time I saw him
he was in the kitchen.

32:07.393 --> 32:08.625
Same as you guys.

32:08.627 --> 32:09.927
He could be dying in here
somewhere.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.428
Or already dead.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.396
We can't stay much longer.

32:12.398 --> 32:13.597
The radiation is climbing --

32:13.599 --> 32:14.631
we are going now!

32:14.633 --> 32:15.699
Come on, let's go!

32:15.701 --> 32:16.133
Yes!

32:18.337 --> 32:22.239

32:22.241 --> 32:23.941
There is something I gotta do.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.075
What?

32:25.077 --> 32:26.443
I've left one too many people
behind...

32:26.445 --> 32:28.512
I can't do that again...

32:28.514 --> 32:32.916

with this gorman idiot again.

32:45.597 --> 32:46.797
<i> Axel, hurry up!!</i>

32:46.799 --> 32:48.332
You sure you wanna do this?

Absolutely.

32:49.668 --> 32:50.934
Just hurry.

32:50.936 --> 32:51.835
If we don't make it up
in 10 minutes,

32:51.837 --> 32:52.970
we're not coming up.

32:52.972 --> 32:53.804
Stop it.

32:53.806 --> 32:54.538
Keys are in the visor...

32:54.540 --> 32:55.973
I'll see you up there.

32:55.975 --> 32:59.142
Stop dragging out the good-byes.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.812
Vanessa!

33:01.814 --> 33:05.615
<i> Axel, let's go!!</i>

33:05.617 --> 33:07.818
I will tell you later.

33:24.470 --> 33:28.705
You count to 500,
then you get outta here.

33:28.707 --> 33:30.073
I should be the one
to do this.

33:30.075 --> 33:31.041
No, just wait here for me.

33:31.043 --> 33:33.043

Where is Axel?

39:30.302 --> 39:32.035
Where is he?

39:32.037 --> 39:33.169
He didn't make it.

"he didn't make it?"

What do you mean,
"he didn't make it?!!!"

39:35.674 --> 39:38.007

It's not affecting me!

39:38.810 --> 39:39.509
No!

39:39.511 --> 39:41.378
It's gorman, he turned!

39:41.380 --> 39:43.213
He bit Axel.

39:43.215 --> 39:44.848
Maybe I can turn him back!

39:44.850 --> 39:48.017
Vanessa, you don't understand,
gorman killed Axel!!!

39:48.019 --> 39:50.387

Around here, what are
the odds of that.

40:34.199 --> 40:39.002
I'm sorry, I know how much
he meant to you.

40:39.004 --> 40:42.305

About you?

I don't know.

I don't know what to think.
