00:06.791 --> 00:11.125
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:11.208 --> 00:14.250
Thank you, Ms. Lourdes. Here, look.

00:15.166 --> 00:17.625
-The change is yours.
-Don't bother.

00:17.708 --> 00:21.125
I knew you'd say that,
but I don't care about money.

00:21.208 --> 00:23.000
I'm just being fair with you.

00:23.083 --> 00:24.875
Thank you, God bless.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.791
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

00:28.583 --> 00:33.250
I told her the red silk would look
more exuberant in the blue sky.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.500
Dad,

00:35.500 --> 00:37.208
look what I brought you.

00:52.125 --> 00:56.416
Miguel, be careful with what
you're getting into to have this money.

00:56.500 --> 00:58.333
Dad, I know it's expensive,

00:58.916 --> 01:02.333
but I'm not worried, I have other plans.
Do you trust me?

01:03.208 --> 01:04.375
-Do you?
-Yes.

01:04.458 --> 01:06.500
You'll be making kites by yourself soon,

01:06.583 --> 01:09.375
with the color and size you want,
however you want it.

01:10.958 --> 01:11.833
Miguel…

01:37.791 --> 01:39.333
<i>Forget about it! Insane!</i>

01:39.416 --> 01:41.708
<i>-You nailed it!</i>
<i>-Yeah?</i>

01:43.416 --> 01:44.916
<i>What's up, homies?</i>

01:52.458 --> 01:56.166
Chai, I know you didn't mean
to break up with me.

01:58.166 --> 02:01.083
It was to protect me, right? As always.

02:01.791 --> 02:04.291
You should see
how beautiful this place is.

02:11.375 --> 02:13.125
You can't skate here,

02:13.750 --> 02:15.000
but you can surf.

02:20.250 --> 02:21.875
<i>What's up, surf gang?</i>

02:22.500 --> 02:26.666
<i>The secret is to place your feet wider,</i>
<i>and bend your knees slightly.</i>

02:26.750 --> 02:29.833
<i>If you wipe out, don't worry.</i>

02:29.916 --> 02:32.000
<i>Wipeout means experience.</i>

02:32.500 --> 02:35.250
<i>More important</i>
<i>than standing on your surfboard</i>

02:36.416 --> 02:37.625
<i>is to train your paddling.</i>

02:37.708 --> 02:42.000
<i>Three rules to plant weed at home</i>
<i>with no cash.</i>

02:42.083 --> 02:43.416
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

02:43.500 --> 02:47.875
<i>First tip: the secret to have</i>
<i>healthy growth is lighting.</i>

02:47.958 --> 02:49.750
<i>That's what I always say,</i>

02:49.833 --> 02:52.500
<i>if you're going to plant it,</i>
<i>do it outside.</i>

03:22.625 --> 03:24.541
Paddle, get up.

03:25.166 --> 03:28.166
For a nice popping up, use this knee.

03:30.416 --> 03:31.625
Okay, again.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.208
Stretch it, like this.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.291
Another one for the team?

03:49.458 --> 03:50.583
What the heck?

03:53.625 --> 03:54.625
She's impressive.

03:54.708 --> 03:55.541
Wow!

04:10.666 --> 04:13.791
-Hey.
-Hey, wait! Let me help you!

04:13.875 --> 04:16.625
Why do you carry everything at once?

04:16.708 --> 04:18.708
I'm just lazy.

04:19.333 --> 04:20.625
This one is lighter.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.125
Hey, wait.

04:26.916 --> 04:28.208
The tip, miss.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.500
Thank you.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.916
-Thank you.
-No problem. Give me this one.

04:37.291 --> 04:38.833
-You're strong, huh?
-Yes.

04:52.416 --> 04:53.250
Hey, Vilma.

04:53.750 --> 04:55.083
Hey. Hi, Elias.

04:55.791 --> 04:58.416
Just another day at the hotel, right?

04:59.291 --> 05:03.000
-No workers at the reception desk.
-She just left to help Diego.

05:03.083 --> 05:04.208
Well…

05:06.250 --> 05:10.458
not to mention
our dear bartender slash drug dealer.

05:10.958 --> 05:12.583
-What?
-Well…

05:13.083 --> 05:15.500
-Drug dealer?
-Maresia didn't tell you?

05:16.166 --> 05:17.166
No.

05:18.375 --> 05:19.875
It's better this way.

05:19.958 --> 05:22.416
If you knew Miguel is a drug dealer,

05:23.208 --> 05:27.000
and you hadn't done anything,
things would get ugly.

05:29.916 --> 05:31.375
Oh, Vilma…

06:02.958 --> 06:06.458
Hi, Hélio. I know we don't have
the construction permit yet,

06:06.541 --> 06:09.875
but you can send the materials,
I want to start soon.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.500
Excuse me. Pororoca, right?

06:13.583 --> 06:15.666
Surfers get one on the house.

06:16.166 --> 06:17.000
Helena?

06:18.375 --> 06:20.291
Helena from the Sacred Heart?

06:20.375 --> 06:23.166
It's me, Léo, from 5th grade.

06:25.083 --> 06:27.250
Léo, I think you're mistaken.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.000
-Excuse me.
-No, wait.

06:29.083 --> 06:30.375
You're Helena, right?

06:34.541 --> 06:37.208
Diego. Help me, I need to leave.

06:37.708 --> 06:41.375
-Can you take the night shift? Thanks.
-Night shift? Hey!

06:52.541 --> 06:53.833
Good evening, team.

06:53.916 --> 06:55.500
Good evening!

06:56.166 --> 06:57.000
All right.

06:57.791 --> 06:58.833
First of all,

06:59.750 --> 07:02.083
go wash your ugly faces!

07:03.291 --> 07:04.125
Second,

07:05.541 --> 07:08.500
we have double shifts today.
That means cleaning,

07:10.166 --> 07:11.125
fumigating,

07:12.208 --> 07:15.583
and organizing this entire lodge.

07:15.666 --> 07:16.916
Yes, sir.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.375
-Yes.
-And the last thing.

07:18.458 --> 07:19.458
Yes, sir.

07:20.583 --> 07:21.833
Today is also the day

07:22.375 --> 07:23.500
that we'll install…

07:25.958 --> 07:29.000
this state-of-the-art AC

07:29.083 --> 07:31.916
that Catarina, even after being mugged,

07:32.000 --> 07:33.875
managed to buy. So, please…

07:35.500 --> 07:37.250
Yes, girl! You're amazing!

07:37.333 --> 07:38.958
She really does everything.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.083
Now,

07:40.166 --> 07:43.291
to divide the tasks and not be unfair,

07:43.875 --> 07:46.166
I, Miguel,

07:46.250 --> 07:48.125
developed a method.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.583
A great brand-new method.

07:52.041 --> 07:53.500
Okay, everybody get one.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.791
Cheers. As Diego would say,

07:56.875 --> 07:58.708
<i>Adentro.</i>

08:01.125 --> 08:03.958
-That's brandy.
-You'll clean the rooms.

08:04.041 --> 08:06.208
-Water.
-It tastes like tap water.

08:06.291 --> 08:09.166
You'll install the AC, you can't be drunk.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.041
-And the last one, vodka.
-Vodka.

08:12.125 --> 08:15.250
-Yes, high five, partner!
-We're the perfect team!

08:16.083 --> 08:18.041
-Shall we?
-Yes.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.041
-Come on.
-Wait.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.916
Yasmin, do you wanna switch?

08:22.875 --> 08:23.750
Hum--

08:23.833 --> 08:27.708
I've already fumigated the church,
so I know what to do.

08:27.791 --> 08:28.833
If you--

08:28.916 --> 08:31.625
Sure! Go get it, boy!

08:31.708 --> 08:33.875
-Yep.
-High five, partner!

08:46.083 --> 08:49.583
Are you incorporating Marie Kondo here?

08:49.666 --> 08:50.833
You silly!

08:50.916 --> 08:54.750
Wow, this one would make me really happy.

08:57.083 --> 08:59.541
You know what else makes me happy?

08:59.625 --> 09:00.791
What?

09:01.375 --> 09:04.333
-Ta-da!
-Where did you find that?

09:04.416 --> 09:07.750
Miguel took it from the bar,
and I was going to bring it back.

09:07.833 --> 09:11.083
Then let's do the honors.
You can keep these shoes.

09:12.458 --> 09:14.291
It'll be a long night, honey.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.000
Miguel?

09:20.583 --> 09:22.208
There are no masks in here.

09:22.291 --> 09:24.125
Jeez. There's none here either.

09:25.458 --> 09:29.000
We'll have to act like ninjas, Conrado.

09:33.750 --> 09:34.583
Look.

09:36.875 --> 09:39.125
-Did you find the pesticide?
-No.

09:41.250 --> 09:42.416
No, I didn't.

09:49.291 --> 09:50.125
Miguel.

09:51.083 --> 09:51.916
Yeah?

09:53.541 --> 09:56.125
Man, I switched with Yasmin

09:57.791 --> 09:59.500
'cause I wanted to thank you.

10:00.291 --> 10:02.208
Thank me for what?

10:02.291 --> 10:04.083
I don't know if you know,

10:05.041 --> 10:08.000
but my life changed after I met you.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.125
Stop it. You know why?

10:11.750 --> 10:14.291
Because my life changed after I met you.

10:14.375 --> 10:16.750
-Me?
-Yes, you changed it.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.458
You changed my life.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.250
Remember when you…

10:22.375 --> 10:23.750
made me talk to God?

10:25.166 --> 10:26.791
-Yes.
-So,

10:27.625 --> 10:29.458
that really opened my eyes.

10:29.541 --> 10:32.458
It helped me solve a problem at home.

10:32.541 --> 10:35.041
-I saw it.
-You saw it?

10:36.333 --> 10:39.000
It was just a figure of speech.
You told me

10:39.083 --> 10:41.791
you were going through a lot at home.

10:41.875 --> 10:42.708
And… Anyway.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.333
Remember?

10:47.750 --> 10:49.125
Oh, found it!

10:49.625 --> 10:51.791
Oh, the pesticide!

10:51.875 --> 10:52.708
There.

10:53.208 --> 10:54.541
-Like this?
-No, wait.

10:55.083 --> 10:56.333
There. Done.

10:56.416 --> 10:58.458
-Have you done this before?
-Yes.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.958
Nice bracelet. Cute.

11:08.708 --> 11:11.250
I'm glad you like it. I made it myself.

11:15.583 --> 11:18.416
Diego was lucky for being off tonight.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.291
I don't think so.
He replaced Helena at the bar.

11:22.958 --> 11:26.833
Really? I thought he was studying
for the second test.

11:26.916 --> 11:28.958
Is it like this? Or like this?

11:33.875 --> 11:35.541
Did he pass on the first test?

11:36.541 --> 11:38.666
I don't know. Maybe I misunderstood.

11:38.750 --> 11:40.708
I just knew he was going to study.

11:41.208 --> 11:42.125
Got it.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.750
-Done. Can you finish it?
-Yes.

11:52.458 --> 11:54.666
-Thank you, Marília!
-You're welcome.

11:57.458 --> 11:58.833
Shit.

11:58.916 --> 12:02.666
We should throw a surprise party
to thank Catarina.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.375
We can put up a sign.

12:04.458 --> 12:08.500
"Thank you, Saint Catarina.
Amen. Hallelujah!"

12:09.208 --> 12:11.083
Ouch, Yasmin!

12:12.375 --> 12:15.125
"For the AC blessing given to us!"

12:18.333 --> 12:19.166
I mean it.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.375
Where did she get the money?

12:23.666 --> 12:24.958
Think about it.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.708
Her mom's in jail,
her accounts are blocked,

12:29.250 --> 12:33.000
and she has a lot of dresses,
clothes and shoes.

12:33.083 --> 12:36.125
Everything's so fancy. How come?

12:36.208 --> 12:38.375
I prefer to remain silent.

12:39.083 --> 12:39.916
What?

12:40.708 --> 12:42.625
-Do you know something?
-Me?

12:42.708 --> 12:45.458
-No.
-You do! Now you have to tell me!

12:45.958 --> 12:48.250
-It's a secret, okay?
-Okay.

12:49.458 --> 12:52.458
She stole the money from the staff.

12:52.541 --> 12:54.166
She stole the money?

12:54.666 --> 12:58.500
Hey, are you crazy?
It's a secret, girlfriend.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.666
Holy shit!

13:02.375 --> 13:03.625
I'm appalled.

13:15.416 --> 13:16.625
Bakery delivery.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.375
-Good morning.
-Morning.

13:21.708 --> 13:24.166
You can keep that key. I made a copy.

13:24.250 --> 13:28.125
I know you didn't ask for it,
but I never offered it.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.125
-How about breakfast?
-Sure.

13:32.208 --> 13:35.458
-The bread is still hot.
-Don't you have something to tell me?

13:35.958 --> 13:36.791
Tell what?

13:38.375 --> 13:39.291
What is it?

13:42.291 --> 13:44.458
-About the test, Diego.
-Oh, that.

13:45.541 --> 13:47.500
I thought I'd told you. I forgot.

13:48.291 --> 13:49.416
Catarina told me.

13:50.375 --> 13:52.541
Right. Is that a problem?

14:00.541 --> 14:03.083
-What are you doing?
-Setting the table.

14:04.125 --> 14:05.291
I'll do this.

14:06.041 --> 14:06.916
I'll help you.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.000
Don't…

14:12.500 --> 14:13.666
What is this?

14:25.625 --> 14:27.375
Are you Miguel's supplier?

14:30.125 --> 14:31.375
Are you selling that?

14:35.000 --> 14:35.833
Tell me.

14:39.791 --> 14:42.375
You don't know what's like
to be a single Mom.

14:43.541 --> 14:45.750
You have no idea how hard I work--

14:45.833 --> 14:48.625
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Because you're not here.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.833
You don't want to stay with us.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.416
You're my daughter's family, you know?

15:03.083 --> 15:05.583
-You wanna be with Catarina.
-Marília…

15:05.666 --> 15:06.875
That's what you want.

15:06.958 --> 15:09.458
-I'm leaving. I can't talk to you!
-It is!

15:18.000 --> 15:20.125
If you leave, don't bother coming back.

15:45.750 --> 15:46.708
<i>Hey, bro.</i>

15:46.791 --> 15:47.916
<i>How are you?</i>

15:48.000 --> 15:51.166
<i>Bring everyone over.</i>
<i>We have something to celebrate.</i>

15:54.250 --> 15:56.333
Rodrigo, what are we celebrating?

15:56.416 --> 15:58.000
Your screw-ups?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.250
No, thanks. I'm not going.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.750
Diego.

16:05.666 --> 16:07.041
I screwed up yesterday.

16:07.125 --> 16:09.958
-I didn't know Marília didn't know--
-It's okay.

16:10.458 --> 16:12.791
-I'm sorry.
-It wasn't working.

16:13.375 --> 16:14.416
We broke up.

16:15.416 --> 16:16.541
Really?

16:17.458 --> 16:18.291
Yes.

16:19.041 --> 16:21.791
Jeez. Was it because of the test?

16:22.541 --> 16:23.375
No.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.083
She said that…

16:27.583 --> 16:28.916
What? You can tell me.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.375
That…

16:33.500 --> 16:35.166
I want to be with you.

16:38.541 --> 16:39.500
Do you?

16:43.166 --> 16:44.541
Can I talk to you guys?

16:46.458 --> 16:47.291
Please.

16:54.541 --> 16:56.708
How was it? Tell me! Say it!

16:56.791 --> 16:58.208
I told you I was mugged.

16:58.291 --> 17:00.375
You saw me when I got here.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.125
You lied, just confess!

17:02.750 --> 17:04.458
I know what's like to need money.

17:05.041 --> 17:07.041
I don't get why you stole from the staff.

17:07.125 --> 17:09.208
Shit, Helena. You told him?

17:09.291 --> 17:11.000
I said it was a secret.

17:11.666 --> 17:13.291
I'm gonna be sick.

17:14.458 --> 17:17.083
-How was it? Say it!
-Calm down, Miguel.

17:17.166 --> 17:20.250
I was with her.
It's dangerous in the city.

17:20.333 --> 17:23.583
Oh, it's dangerous? So you were with her?

17:26.208 --> 17:27.125
Tell me, Diego.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.208
Wait. Guys, look.

17:38.291 --> 17:42.000
Catarina got us the AC,
and she regretted it.

17:42.083 --> 17:43.625
Everybody makes mistakes.

17:43.708 --> 17:45.791
-I lied.
-There you go.

17:47.083 --> 17:48.333
I wasn't mugged.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.625
-Can I tell my side of the story?
-Sure!

17:54.375 --> 17:55.375
When my mom…

17:58.958 --> 18:00.125
When I got here,

18:00.708 --> 18:02.041
it wasn't easy for me.

18:02.875 --> 18:06.083
I just did what I'd always done
when I got sad.

18:07.083 --> 18:07.958
Buy stuff.

18:09.416 --> 18:10.916
But I had no money.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.125
They've blocked my cards, my account.

18:13.625 --> 18:17.666
I wasn't thinking.
I took the money, but I regretted it.

18:18.791 --> 18:22.416
So I figured it out,
I sold everything and bought the AC.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.666
Rodrigo bought it,
but I only knew it was him when he--

18:25.750 --> 18:28.041
Wait. Rodrigo bought the AC?

18:28.125 --> 18:32.291
-I didn't know it was him.
-God. I'd rather die in this heat!

18:32.375 --> 18:33.375
Oh my God.

18:36.375 --> 18:38.125
Can you smell that?

18:38.208 --> 18:40.250
Yes, it smells like betrayal.

18:40.333 --> 18:43.875
Maybe she did betray us,
but she regretted it.

18:43.958 --> 18:45.666
Let's try and understand her.

18:47.708 --> 18:51.458
-Are you crying?
-I don't know, my eyes are tearing up.

18:52.250 --> 18:56.041
Eyes tearing up,
difficulty to breathe, and vomit.

18:56.125 --> 18:59.083
Did you use this to fumigate this place?

18:59.166 --> 19:00.375
Are you insane?

19:00.458 --> 19:03.750
It's an allergic crisis.
You're itching, she's vomiting.

19:03.833 --> 19:07.125
For goodness's sake, everyone out!

19:08.083 --> 19:09.333
Come on, out!

19:11.875 --> 19:12.916
Come on, guys!

19:21.583 --> 19:22.416
Hey.

19:23.666 --> 19:25.458
Is the party still on?

19:26.208 --> 19:29.875
-Well, I thought you weren't interested.
-You disappointed me.

19:32.208 --> 19:35.541
Look, Miguel, I know I screwed up
with the weed, okay?

19:35.625 --> 19:39.625
I should've defended you to my dad,
but you know him.

19:40.125 --> 19:43.875
I'll be straight with you.
We fumigated the lodge,

19:43.958 --> 19:47.166
it smells like pesticide,
so I thought we'd go to the party.

19:48.166 --> 19:51.083
So, between dying intoxicated
and going to my party,

19:51.166 --> 19:53.000
you'd rather go to my party.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.291
Nice. That's very altruistic.

19:58.875 --> 20:01.166
Just a second.

20:06.166 --> 20:07.000
Hello?

20:09.083 --> 20:10.208
Yes, that's him.

20:23.791 --> 20:26.416
Apparently, you don't like
to answer your phone.

20:28.375 --> 20:29.708
I turned off my phone.

20:31.750 --> 20:32.625
Bad day?

20:38.583 --> 20:39.541
Got it.

20:39.625 --> 20:42.541
Well, maybe this will cheer you up.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.041
Your mom's lawyer called me.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.333
-Hassef?
-Yes.

20:47.916 --> 20:50.625
He wanted to talk to you. It's urgent.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.875
Did something happen to my mom?

20:53.541 --> 20:54.541
Long story short,

20:55.041 --> 20:58.541
I called the police chief.
He owed my dad some favors.

20:59.541 --> 21:00.375
And then,

21:00.916 --> 21:04.791
I managed to schedule a visit,
so you can see your mom.

21:05.333 --> 21:06.166
Today.

21:09.791 --> 21:11.291
Do you think I should go?

21:12.875 --> 21:17.125
I told her we should take a break
from each other.

21:19.625 --> 21:20.750
Do you wanna go?

21:26.291 --> 21:27.125
Yes.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Thank you.

21:33.416 --> 21:36.875
-I don't know where your toy is.
-Yes, you do.

21:36.958 --> 21:40.333
I don't. You said you were
too old for kitchen toys.

21:40.416 --> 21:42.916
I lied, I still like it, Mom!

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Sofia, please, stop complaining.

21:48.625 --> 21:51.625
Hey! What are you doing there?

21:51.708 --> 21:55.208
I can't stand running away
from Léo anymore.

21:55.291 --> 21:57.166
How about we switch roles?

21:57.250 --> 22:00.291
I can teach yoga,
and you can serve drinks.

22:00.375 --> 22:03.500
-What do you think?
-Classes are done for today.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.250
So, I can take care of Sofia!

22:08.125 --> 22:09.666
Far away from guests.

22:10.958 --> 22:11.791
Deal.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.875
-Yay!
-I love you.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.458
-To the bar.
-Come on.

22:16.458 --> 22:19.416
-What do you wanna do?
-I wanna play kitchen!

22:19.500 --> 22:21.500
Where are your kitchen toys?

22:21.583 --> 22:23.833
Mom hid them because of the weed.

22:25.291 --> 22:28.291
-Because of what?
-The weed Mommy sells.

22:57.875 --> 22:58.708
Mom.

23:15.500 --> 23:16.625
No way.

23:18.708 --> 23:21.375
I can't believe you still have this, Mom.

23:23.208 --> 23:25.291
I haven't seen this handkerchief for ages!

23:25.875 --> 23:27.833
Look, it has your smell.

23:30.291 --> 23:31.875
You know what was my only mistake?

23:33.000 --> 23:34.625
Wanting to see you happy.

23:35.625 --> 23:36.458
Because

23:37.041 --> 23:38.583
when your dad died

23:38.666 --> 23:40.666
and we had to move here,

23:41.750 --> 23:43.666
you were so sad, sweetie.

23:44.625 --> 23:45.541
So sad.

23:47.083 --> 23:49.833
On that day, I made a promise.

23:49.916 --> 23:50.875
I swore

23:52.166 --> 23:54.250
that I'd do anything

23:54.333 --> 23:57.541
to give you everything
you wanted to be happy.

23:58.708 --> 24:01.916
Even if it'd bring me here,
to this shithole.

24:04.875 --> 24:06.375
I'd do it all over again.

24:08.708 --> 24:12.250
You should know I'll spend
a lot of time here.

24:12.333 --> 24:13.583
-No, Mom.
-Yes.

24:13.666 --> 24:16.000
-You won't.
-I will. You know why?

24:16.083 --> 24:20.166
I fired Hassef. I hired a public defender.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.666
What do you mean? Why?

24:22.750 --> 24:24.125
And the MBA money?

24:26.041 --> 24:29.625
There's no money, Catarina.
We ran out of money, we're broke.

24:32.375 --> 24:34.291
No. Wait, Mom.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.166
Calm down.

24:36.250 --> 24:39.625
We'll think about this together
and figure it out.

24:39.708 --> 24:42.333
-There must be another way.
-Unless…

24:42.416 --> 24:44.833
-Unless?
-How's Rodrigo?

24:48.416 --> 24:50.416
-I'm not in love with him.
-Sure you are.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.708
-I'm not.
-You are.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.583
You just don't know it yet, but you are.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.750
I know what you like.

24:59.958 --> 25:01.166
Rodrigo too.

25:02.208 --> 25:05.791
Or are you telling me you're happier now

25:05.875 --> 25:08.333
working at that shitty hotel
to make a living?

25:15.958 --> 25:16.791
Keep it.

25:21.500 --> 25:22.333
Thank you.

25:46.166 --> 25:50.333
Wow, look at him! You clean up nice!

25:50.416 --> 25:53.875
Thank you. You look beautiful too.

25:53.958 --> 25:57.041
-I need to be up to your level.
-Oh, please.

25:57.125 --> 25:59.083
This is what I could get.

25:59.166 --> 26:02.875
Yours and this is yours.
I can't go back. That place stinks.

26:02.958 --> 26:05.125
Miguel, I'm not wearing these sneakers.

26:05.708 --> 26:08.083
-I told you…
-You got the wrong shoes.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.583
-Conrado, you're sharp!
-Wrong shoes.

26:10.666 --> 26:11.875
Yasmin too.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.958
You look pretty.
Nice makeup. Right, Conrado?

26:17.041 --> 26:19.041
That's what being single does to you.

26:20.041 --> 26:21.875
Single? What about that guy?

26:23.250 --> 26:24.208
It's over.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.333
Let's go, staff!

26:30.833 --> 26:34.416
Let's party!
Babysitters are expensive, let's go.

26:34.500 --> 26:37.708
-Aren't we waiting for Catarina?
-No, she'll steal our wallets!

26:37.791 --> 26:39.750
-Come on!
-Oh my God, Miguel!

26:39.833 --> 26:42.458
-Let's go.
-That was offensive.

26:44.750 --> 26:46.291
No need to wait for me.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.083
-Miguel.
-Yeah?

26:53.166 --> 26:55.291
-I wanna talk to you.
-We'll talk on the way.

26:55.375 --> 26:58.125
-No, seriously. Wait.
-What is it?

26:58.625 --> 27:01.250
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm okay.

27:03.041 --> 27:04.333
It's just…

27:04.416 --> 27:06.500
When you thanked me yesterday

27:07.083 --> 27:09.208
for helping you to change your life…

27:09.791 --> 27:10.625
Yes.

27:11.333 --> 27:14.000
…I was actually trying to say

27:15.208 --> 27:16.541
that you changed mine.

27:17.666 --> 27:21.333
I didn't know what I wanted
when I applied for this job.

27:22.458 --> 27:23.291
Anyway,

27:24.041 --> 27:25.083
I found myself.

27:27.041 --> 27:27.875
Wow.

27:29.083 --> 27:31.375
Great! That's great.

27:32.000 --> 27:32.958
Wow, Conrado!

27:36.291 --> 27:37.333
Thanks, man.

27:37.416 --> 27:38.458
Thank you.

27:55.500 --> 27:56.333
Conrado…

27:59.458 --> 28:01.375
-I'm sorry.
-No, man--

28:01.458 --> 28:04.791
-I needed to do that. I'm sorry.
-Hey, Conrado!

28:26.916 --> 28:28.916
Just a second. I'll be right back.

28:33.625 --> 28:34.500
What's up?

28:46.875 --> 28:48.083
Good luck.

28:51.708 --> 28:53.791
What? Dance with me.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.083
What's with that song, Rodrigo?

28:57.625 --> 28:59.041
I know it's an old song,

28:59.125 --> 29:02.375
but I wanted to show you I've changed.

29:03.458 --> 29:06.000
-I know you.
-You don't believe me? I've changed!

29:06.083 --> 29:08.916
I'm healthy,
following my dreams, training.

29:09.416 --> 29:13.708
In fact, Maresia called a scout
to see me surf.

29:14.750 --> 29:17.958
I can finally have a sponsor
and make a living out of this!

29:18.041 --> 29:20.833
Congratulations. I'm really happy for you.

29:24.708 --> 29:26.791
-Why don't you live here?
-What?

29:26.875 --> 29:29.250
Forget about that hotel and that job.

29:29.958 --> 29:31.750
Let's give ourselves a chance.

29:32.291 --> 29:36.041
You know? But this time,
no marriage, no pressure.

29:37.208 --> 29:38.333
Just the two of us.

29:40.041 --> 29:40.875
Rodrigo…

29:44.041 --> 29:47.166
just like you've changed,
I wanna change too.

29:48.875 --> 29:53.000
I can only do that and get to know myself
far away from this.

29:54.958 --> 29:56.625
From this life, this luxury.

29:56.708 --> 30:00.250
Or I'll stay like this forever
and I'll never be truly happy.

30:02.333 --> 30:03.166
I'm sorry.

30:06.333 --> 30:08.291
Catarina, nobody is truly happy.

30:10.750 --> 30:12.583
That's not true, Rodrigo.

30:13.791 --> 30:14.791
That's not true.

30:26.125 --> 30:29.375
I had to learn from Elias
that Miguel is selling drugs here.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.375
You didn't tell me.

30:31.458 --> 30:35.583
I didn't tell you because
I've talked to Miguel, it's solved.

30:35.666 --> 30:38.375
-I didn't want to bother you.
-It's not solved!

30:38.458 --> 30:39.791
-This is serious.
-I know.

30:39.875 --> 30:41.833
We've built this hotel together!

30:41.916 --> 30:43.666
I need to trust my partner!

30:43.750 --> 30:46.458
I'm here with you! Don't trust Elias.

30:46.541 --> 30:48.916
He wants to turn ourselves
against each other.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.250
He's not the only problem.

30:50.333 --> 30:53.916
-Why are you unmaking the bed?
-Yasmin has her own life.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.208
-We don't--
-She didn't want to stay here!

30:56.291 --> 30:58.666
We don't even use this couch, leave it.

30:59.333 --> 31:02.083
-Since she got here--
-I'm trying to be a good Dad!

31:02.166 --> 31:06.291
No, you're like a teenager.
And I'm the adult, but I'm on my own.

31:26.666 --> 31:28.583
-Where are you going?
-The water is cold.

31:28.666 --> 31:29.500
Wait!

31:30.000 --> 31:30.833
Wait.

31:31.791 --> 31:33.958
-Can we talk?
-About what?

31:34.458 --> 31:36.875
-You stole and lied to me.
-I know!

31:37.416 --> 31:38.333
I know, Diego.

31:41.041 --> 31:42.708
And I regret it.

31:43.291 --> 31:45.458
I'm trying to change. Doesn't that count?

31:46.666 --> 31:48.208
You know what's the worst?

31:48.958 --> 31:51.333
I was starting to like you for real.

31:51.416 --> 31:54.708
-I'm into you--
-But I don't know who you are!

31:54.791 --> 31:55.791
This is me.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.166
This girl.

31:59.291 --> 32:00.500
Right in front of you.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.166
Full of flaws.

32:04.208 --> 32:08.458
She lied to people who were nice to her,
but she's trying to change.

32:09.333 --> 32:11.500
She needs a second chance.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.875
Specially from the guy
who's in front of her.

32:20.583 --> 32:21.416
I'm sorry.

32:26.583 --> 32:28.791
When I decided to come to Brazil,

32:30.083 --> 32:31.708
I wanted to enjoy life,

32:33.208 --> 32:34.166
to be free,

32:35.250 --> 32:36.375
to live peacefully.

32:37.625 --> 32:39.291
Without any kind of trouble.

32:40.458 --> 32:41.541
Do you understand?

32:47.541 --> 32:49.375
You want to be free,

32:51.125 --> 32:53.166
but it seems you're running away from it.

33:30.041 --> 33:32.375
Finally. I thought you weren't coming.

33:34.458 --> 33:35.625
Hi. Want some?

33:35.708 --> 33:36.625
-For me?
-Yep.

33:37.625 --> 33:40.041
Guilt, harvest 2022.

33:43.708 --> 33:46.041
You can tell me. What's going on?

33:50.833 --> 33:51.666
Conrado…

33:55.708 --> 33:57.041
He kissed me.

33:59.083 --> 34:00.125
What did you do?

34:01.500 --> 34:02.458
I reacted badly.

34:05.791 --> 34:08.416
I didn't know what to do.
I think I hurt him.

34:11.916 --> 34:13.500
It's not your fault.

34:14.500 --> 34:15.708
You know what's the worst?

34:17.916 --> 34:18.750
What?

34:21.500 --> 34:23.375
I thought he was into you.

34:24.458 --> 34:25.291
Me?

34:54.791 --> 34:55.666
LSD BAZOOKA

34:55.750 --> 34:58.375
-Who wants it first?
-Here!

35:00.875 --> 35:03.250
-Here!
-No, come around.

35:03.333 --> 35:06.458
I'm not kidding. Want some, Pororoca?

35:06.541 --> 35:09.333
No. I need to train tomorrow morning.

35:09.416 --> 35:10.250
All right.

35:14.666 --> 35:15.500
Helena?

35:18.666 --> 35:19.625
Marília.

35:21.166 --> 35:22.250
Come with me.

35:22.333 --> 35:24.041
-Helena.
-Marília?

35:31.458 --> 35:32.416
Yes, Diego.

35:33.416 --> 35:35.208
I didn't want to hurt you.

35:35.291 --> 35:37.833
I like Sofia, and I like you.

35:38.791 --> 35:42.875
- But sometimes things change.
-They change.

35:45.458 --> 35:46.416
I understand.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.041
Helena!

36:09.166 --> 36:10.000
Helena!

36:10.541 --> 36:12.041
Stop saying that name!

36:13.750 --> 36:14.625
Girl…

36:17.750 --> 36:18.625
Girl…

36:22.291 --> 36:23.375
What happened?

36:27.166 --> 36:28.583
I can't do this anymore.

36:29.916 --> 36:32.583
I can't take these things again.

36:34.791 --> 36:36.291
What things?

36:39.250 --> 36:40.291
What is it?

36:42.916 --> 36:44.500
Léo Pororoca and I…

36:46.750 --> 36:48.666
He was in my class in 5th grade.

36:51.791 --> 36:54.416
Back then, everybody in school,

36:55.000 --> 36:56.291
including him,

36:58.166 --> 36:59.916
used to call me "Free Willy."

37:05.583 --> 37:07.083
That's silly, honey.

37:08.875 --> 37:10.583
-Don't worry about it.
-Silly?

37:12.958 --> 37:15.750
I went through a fucking surgery,
I almost died!

37:23.250 --> 37:24.666
Now it looks like this.

37:29.916 --> 37:32.583
Everybody has a childhood trauma, Helena.

37:34.166 --> 37:35.375
This will pass.

37:36.333 --> 37:37.166
Oh yeah?

37:39.250 --> 37:41.333
Childhood trauma is something serious.

37:42.041 --> 37:43.833
We carry this our whole lives.

37:44.708 --> 37:47.916
You should know, because Sofia
is being traumatized.

37:48.625 --> 37:50.666
What does she have to do with this?

37:50.750 --> 37:53.416
She told me you're selling weed.

37:53.500 --> 37:56.125
She's confused.
She'll lose her mind, like me.

38:13.791 --> 38:14.791
Look at me.

38:15.875 --> 38:16.958
Look at me.

38:18.875 --> 38:21.541
You're not Helena from 5th grade anymore.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.833
Come, I'm going to help you.

38:30.583 --> 38:32.250
Look at yourself in the mirror.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.333
Look right into your eyes and say,

38:36.000 --> 38:37.041
"I'm strong!"

38:39.708 --> 38:41.666
-Marília…
-Do it.

38:42.541 --> 38:43.500
Trust me.

38:46.208 --> 38:47.333
I'm strong.

38:47.958 --> 38:48.791
Louder.

38:49.916 --> 38:51.625
-I'm strong.
-I'm strong!

38:52.208 --> 38:54.791
-I'm strong.
-I'm strong!

38:54.875 --> 38:57.083
-I'm strong!
-I'm beautiful!

38:57.166 --> 38:59.958
-I'm beautiful!
-I'm amazing!

39:00.041 --> 39:01.541
I'm amazing!

39:04.000 --> 39:05.291
That's you.

39:06.333 --> 39:07.875
That's you!

39:09.791 --> 39:11.333
Hey, Rodrigo!

39:11.416 --> 39:14.333
-This is my house.
-Just a little bit more.

39:21.250 --> 39:23.916
It's hard to like someone

39:24.666 --> 39:26.125
and not being able to say it.

39:28.208 --> 39:29.041
Yeah.

39:31.166 --> 39:32.291
Tell me about it.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.583
There, the guilt is over.

39:41.041 --> 39:41.916
Yeah.

39:42.875 --> 39:44.500
I wish it'd end like this,

39:45.541 --> 39:46.458
in a sip.

39:47.958 --> 39:49.166
I'll get more.

39:49.250 --> 39:52.875
Maybe I'll find, I don't know,
Courage, harvest 2022, right?

39:52.958 --> 39:53.833
No!

39:57.250 --> 39:58.333
Stay.

40:01.708 --> 40:03.083
Stay, we can…

40:05.458 --> 40:06.875
We can find it together.

40:17.125 --> 40:19.916
<i>Go. Three, two, one!</i>

40:21.125 --> 40:22.125
<i>Party!</i>

40:25.208 --> 40:27.583
<i>Here's a tip to stop being an idiot.</i>

40:27.666 --> 40:29.875
<i>Okay? Love doesn't take you anywhere.</i>

40:32.833 --> 40:36.333
<i>What do we get for being kind? Nothing.</i>

40:47.541 --> 40:50.208
-Pororoca!
-Hey!

40:51.250 --> 40:54.958
-Don't leave before talking to me.
-But I'm not leaving.

40:55.041 --> 40:57.666
I was avoiding you,
but you know what I found out?

40:57.750 --> 41:01.416
I'm a strong girl.
Not girl, I'm a strong woman. A woman.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.958
I'm not that girl from 5th grade,
no matter what you say or do.

41:05.041 --> 41:06.375
Because I've changed.

41:06.458 --> 41:08.166
-I know you have--
-I'm talking.

41:08.666 --> 41:11.583
I've also changed on the inside. Get it?

41:12.083 --> 41:12.916
I've changed.

41:13.833 --> 41:16.083
-Got it.
-Say that I've changed.

41:16.166 --> 41:18.875
I-- You've changed. I know you've changed.

41:19.541 --> 41:22.875
There's one thing
you haven't changed, though.

41:23.666 --> 41:25.666
You still talk too fast.

41:26.791 --> 41:27.625
Yeah.

41:29.083 --> 41:30.458
I haven't changed that.

41:31.291 --> 41:32.541
I'm glad you know it.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.583
-Just kidding.
-Stop it!

41:36.166 --> 41:37.958
I'm just kidding.

42:15.958 --> 42:17.958
Hi, love of my life.

42:27.333 --> 42:28.416
What's up, gringo?

45:12.875 --> 45:16.000
So you didn't want to drink
from the bazooka of love?

45:19.083 --> 45:21.791
Love is giving me a hard time lately.

45:22.875 --> 45:25.500
That's why you're here alone?

45:26.000 --> 45:26.833
Yep.

45:28.458 --> 45:29.708
I'm thinking.

45:30.791 --> 45:31.916
About what?

45:34.125 --> 45:36.333
Maybe it is every man for himself.

45:38.083 --> 45:38.916
Conrado, I…

45:40.791 --> 45:42.000
I wanted to say…

45:44.833 --> 45:47.708
-It's fine, man. Everything's fine.
-No.

45:48.250 --> 45:49.166
Conrado,

45:50.250 --> 45:51.416
it's not fine.

45:54.541 --> 45:55.375
Miguel…

45:58.083 --> 45:59.333
it's not your fault.

46:05.208 --> 46:07.750
Being into someone
is a risk you gotta take.

46:17.541 --> 46:19.333
You're really important to me.

46:24.458 --> 46:26.625
I admire your courage.

46:35.916 --> 46:37.375
You do have courage.

46:37.875 --> 46:41.333
Coming from the girl
who said we're all on the same boat?

46:42.500 --> 46:44.750
But we're paddling in different ways.

46:45.333 --> 46:46.708
Doing our own things.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
We're just trying.

46:51.333 --> 46:52.666
Like everyone else.

46:54.333 --> 46:55.250
Yeah.

46:56.083 --> 46:57.125
Maybe.

46:59.208 --> 47:00.125
I'm sorry.

47:02.333 --> 47:03.333
I screwed up.

47:18.375 --> 47:19.625
It's okay.

47:21.375 --> 47:23.958
Actually, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

47:25.083 --> 47:27.833
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

47:27.916 --> 47:30.000
-Just a little bit!
-A little bit?

47:30.083 --> 47:32.875
A little bit.
You've seen me at my worst, Catarina.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.041
LSD BAZOOKA

48:33.750 --> 48:34.583
Maresia.

48:35.541 --> 48:36.375
Maresia?

48:37.166 --> 48:39.625
I forgot about our training!

48:39.708 --> 48:42.625
I can get ready now.

48:42.708 --> 48:45.625
We'll talk later, Yasmin.

48:45.708 --> 48:48.125
-Maresia, I--
-Miguel, I gave you a chance.

48:49.458 --> 48:52.166
-You leave me no choice.
-Maresia, I--

48:52.250 --> 48:55.000
This will be your future from now on.

48:55.083 --> 48:56.916
No, it won't.

48:58.333 --> 49:01.583
It'll have to be,
because it won't be here at the hotel.

49:05.250 --> 49:06.708
It wasn't him.

49:07.750 --> 49:08.875
It was me.

49:08.958 --> 49:10.791
The bazooka was my idea.
