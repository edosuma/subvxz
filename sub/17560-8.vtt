some business done.

was your father a thief?

What?

I'm gonna be able to use

00:35.535 --> 00:38.830
Come on, I used it on you in
high school. You loved it then.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.457
Yeah, but I had
zits and braces.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.959

you were talking to me.

doesn't work

00:44.544 --> 00:47.464
how 'bout the one
I just waited in for two hours

00:47.547 --> 00:49.674
to get you these?

00:49.758 --> 00:51.468
Front row tickets to Hairspray?

00:51.551 --> 00:54.596

is gonna get you some action.

was giving you the big eye.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.317
Did you get a look
at her specials?

01:07.400 --> 01:10.820
- No, I didn't notice.
- How could you not notice, bro?

01:10.904 --> 01:13.990
They were practically
holding up the tray.

01:14.073 --> 01:15.950
Dude, you gotta get
over Holly.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.328

from that time.

school and we were in your room.

Ben. You're so cute.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.349
I wanna dance on you.
I'm so pretty."

how you can't understand.

Are you telling me
that you've never been jealous?

08:15.244 --> 08:16.913

it's a wasted emotion.

Oh, so you've never
been jealous?

08:19.582 --> 08:21.459
What kinda freak are you?

08:22.877 --> 08:24.253

08:24.337 --> 08:27.924
Oh, ho, oh, I'm sorry
I'm not as evolved as you.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.551

you have an accent.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.934

08:39.018 --> 08:40.519

of mutton in this entire city.

phone right now in the Bronx.

out of bull testicles?

taste like mutton?

09:06.295 --> 09:07.755

all the holidays

09:07.838 --> 09:09.423

I love the holidays.

and jingle bells.

to save Christmas here.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.838
Big-boobed groupie tongue.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.173
Okay, why are you looking
in the phone book for mutton?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.925
Get with it.
Try the internet.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.095
Uh, she needs mutton,
not porn.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.596
Okay, Lauren.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.433
There are other things
on the internet besides porn.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.893
Get out.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.938
Okay, let's see.
There's 300,000 mutton sites.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.607
Oh, my God, look.
There's a place right here

10:08.691 --> 10:10.651
on Long Island
and they'll deliver.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.737
Okay, do we want it
prepared or unprepared?

10:12.820 --> 10:14.363
Unprepared.
I wanna prepare it.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.615
Okay, and you know what,
if I order it in the next

10:16.699 --> 10:18.367
three minutes, they can have it
here before 5 o'clock.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.869
They just need
your credit card number.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.787
Okay, uh, I'll go get it.
My purse is upstairs.

10:21.871 --> 10:26.083
Is it 2123-3345-1325-6432?

10:28.252 --> 10:30.796
- Yeah, that's it.
- Okay.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.179
Jealous? You told him
you were jealous?

10:38.262 --> 10:40.431
You never tell a guy
you're jealous.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.224
That gives him
all the power, fool.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.393
Okay, well, I tried it your way
and that didn't work.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.812
Well, now you gotta pull out
the classic. Make him jealous.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.900
How, Tina? Get on stage and have
guys throw themselves at me?

10:50.983 --> 10:52.401
I don't have groupies.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.029
Besides, Ben's not
the jealous type.

10:55.112 --> 10:58.199
He's all evolved and European.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.909
Everyone's the jealous type.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.744
Now he's playing at Skids
tonight, right?

11:01.827 --> 11:03.079
I don't know.
We're not talking.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.664
I don't know his schedule.
Eight o'clock.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.958
Perfect. You have, what,
like, three hours

11:08.042 --> 11:09.752
to find a guy
to bring to Ben's gig

11:09.835 --> 11:11.587
and totally rub it in his face.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.964
Now how about that cute guy
by the window?

11:14.048 --> 11:16.884
The one holding hands
with the gay guy?

11:16.967 --> 11:19.428
Okay, okay,
what about, um...

11:19.512 --> 11:20.930
Oh, the guy over there.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.431
He's sitting with his wife.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.059
- Oh, I didn't see her.
- You never do.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.604
Oh, God. I found him.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.439
No gay lover, no wife.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.690
Totally cute.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.610
Oh, my God,
he is kinda cute.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.070
He would totally
make Ben jealous.

11:36.153 --> 11:39.156
Go over there.
Go, go, go.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.908
Hey, hey, hey.
What's up, Tiny?

11:40.991 --> 11:42.451
Hi, what's up?
Hey, slide to the right.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.495
Your big head's
blocking my view.

11:46.372 --> 11:50.000
- What's Holly doing?
- Picking up that cute guy.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.086
She's moving on already?

11:52.169 --> 11:54.255
You women are cold.

11:54.338 --> 11:57.049
Gary, you have dumped a girl
on her birthday

11:57.133 --> 12:00.594
Christmas Eve
and the day her cat died.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.597
Yeah, that was one bad day.

12:03.681 --> 12:04.682
You're never gonna
believe it.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.517
Guess who has a date tonight.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.187
Guess who still has it.
Ooh, ooh!

12:10.271 --> 12:12.857
I got a date tonight
with Danny.

12:23.617 --> 12:26.787
- Danny the fanny.
- Okay, stop it.

12:26.871 --> 12:30.291
He seems to have
a really nice personality.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.626
Yeah, I would too
if I had that ass.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.632
[doorbell rings]

12:38.716 --> 12:41.010
Mutton! Is that the mutton?
Is that the mutton?

12:41.093 --> 12:44.096
Look at that.
4:30, right on the mutton.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.307
How much do I love
the word mutton?

12:46.390 --> 12:48.726
- Tyler? We have delivery.
- Great.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.686
- You sign right here.
- Yes, with pleasure.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.063
- 'Uh, we bring in?'
- Yeah, hurry up.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.402
Oh, my God!

13:00.738 --> 13:04.200
I bet those bull testicles
sound pretty delish right now.

13:05.576 --> 13:09.079
Wait, are you kidding?
We-we didn't order this.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.707
You ordered mutton unprepared.

13:11.790 --> 13:15.628
Unprepared as in I need
salt and pepper, not a gun.

13:15.711 --> 13:19.507
Get it out, get it out.
Get it out!

13:19.590 --> 13:21.550
Why are you freaking out?

13:21.634 --> 13:24.553
I am having
a vicious flashback.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.306
Class trip, fourth grade,
size 16.

13:27.389 --> 13:30.434
No, Lauren,
I don't have time for...

13:30.518 --> 13:32.478
Fourth grade, size 16?

13:33.896 --> 13:36.565
I was on a class trip
to the Central Park Petting Zoo.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.108
No, Lauren,
I don't have time.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.069
I was just innocently
standing there

13:40.152 --> 13:43.197
enjoying my Ho-ho,
and all of a sudden

13:43.280 --> 13:45.407
the other kids pushed
my head into the sheep

13:45.491 --> 13:47.910
and they laughed
and called me fatso.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.996
Not witty children, but cruel.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.414
I must go.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.416
No, no, mister,
please, please, please, please.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.418
You-you gotta, uh,
do something here.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.586
You can't leave the sheep.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.588
You sign, you signed.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.257
No.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.842
Why you sign? Why you sign?

14:09.139 --> 14:10.766
Okay, well, Ben's gonna
be here any second.

14:10.849 --> 14:14.645
- Where's my date?
- You mean lady hips?

14:14.728 --> 14:17.856
Yeah, maybe he got stuck
in the turnstile at the subway.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.903
Will you guys cut it out?
Danny is a really nice guy.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.863
[cell phone rings]

14:24.947 --> 14:26.782
It's probably him.

14:26.865 --> 14:28.242
Hello?

14:28.325 --> 14:30.202
Oh, hey, Danny.
Are you running late?

14:30.286 --> 14:32.746
Yeah, maybe he got
a little behind.

14:34.582 --> 14:36.333
But, Danny,
I was counting on you.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.294
You promised
that you'd be here.

14:38.377 --> 14:41.255
He's getting back together
with his girlfriend.

14:41.338 --> 14:44.675
Okay, so you just used me
to get her jealous?

14:44.758 --> 14:47.136
What an ass.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.931
What a big, giant, lady ass.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.266
Well, thanks a lot, Danny.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.268
I hope that you have fun
on your date.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.811
Can you believe him?

14:55.894 --> 14:58.105
Wait, weren't you gonna
use him to do the same thing?

14:58.188 --> 15:00.316
Yeah, but not anymore.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.276
- I have to go.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.695
Maybe I can help.
I'm happy to make Ben jealous.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.655
Uh, I don't think
that's a very good idea, man.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.116
Yeah, Vince, that's really
sweet, but Ben knows that

15:09.199 --> 15:10.659
we're just friends.
That wouldn't work.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.453
I'll see ya. Bye.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.293
Now if that doesn't
make him jealous.

15:19.376 --> 15:22.046
- Okay, uh, Vince--
- Oh, there's Ben.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.174
Sorry, that wasn't him.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.051
- Okay, Vince--
- There he is.

15:28.677 --> 15:31.847
Wrong again. Argh.

15:31.930 --> 15:34.558
Don't worry, we'll do this
all night if we have to.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.563
Hey, Val, not to worry.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.899
Everything looks beautiful.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.652
You got the lasagna,
the garlic bread

15:44.735 --> 15:46.987
the salad, it's terrific.

15:48.530 --> 15:51.325
Val, we're not in college
anymore, come on.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.705
[screams]
Oh, God! No.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.543
No, sheep, no.
Bad sheep.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.170
'Oh.'

16:05.839 --> 16:07.049
Oh, my God.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.259
What's happened?
How could this happen?

16:09.343 --> 16:10.969
Lauren, will you get
down here and help me?

16:11.053 --> 16:14.014
Oh, God. I've got lasagna
all over the floor.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.141
Wild sheep grazing
in my living room

16:16.225 --> 16:18.560
and a mother-in-law
whose ass I've gotta kiss

16:18.644 --> 16:20.062
that's gonna be here
any minute.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.438
- Uh, Val?
- What?

16:21.522 --> 16:24.024
The ass you're kissing
came early.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.654
Oh, hello. Hi.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.656
Uh, Margaret. Come on in.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.450
Uh, be careful.
Don't slip on the lasagna.

16:34.910 --> 16:37.413
Honey, why is there
a sheep in the loft?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.581
Oh, uh, it's mutton.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.917
Margaret, I know how much
you like mutton.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.544
Just trying to make
what you like.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.254
Thought it would
be a super capper

16:45.337 --> 16:48.882
to your week here
in New York with Julie.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.551
Maybe we've come at a bad time.

16:50.634 --> 16:51.552
Oh, really?

16:51.635 --> 16:53.303
What gave you that idea,
Margaret?

16:53.387 --> 16:56.640
Could it be that my dinner
just crapped on your shoe?

16:58.517 --> 17:01.353
Ricky, maybe you should
take me back to the hotel.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.647
No, wait,
excuse me, Margaret.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.108
But can I just say
that my friend Val

17:06.191 --> 17:07.901
has spent the entire day try..

17:07.984 --> 17:11.238
I am sorry, I cannot be
this close to the beast.

17:11.320 --> 17:13.156
She's gonna be the best
daughter-in-law ever.

17:13.240 --> 17:17.118
Mom, Val was just trying to
make you your favorite dinner.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.288
(Margaret)
'Oh, is that what that was?'

17:19.371 --> 17:22.124
The leash threw me.

17:22.207 --> 17:25.210
Margaret, I wish you liked me
as much as Julie

17:25.294 --> 17:26.962
but that is never gonna happen.
And you know what?

17:27.045 --> 17:29.798
I'm okay with it. Because
you don't have to love me.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.133
Your son loves me.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.426
At least that's
what he said this morning

17:32.509 --> 17:34.094
when we were gettin' down.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.888
I'm gonna go.

17:35.971 --> 17:38.557
Well, I'm gonna stay.
And you are, too, mother.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.810
Rick, it's okay.
I'm fine with her leaving

17:41.894 --> 17:43.645
because it's over,
it's done.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.815
I don't care what you think
of me anymore, Maggie.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.317
Rick, go ahead
and go with your mother.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.652
We'll be together
tomorrow night for Hairspray.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.987
Hairspray?

17:52.070 --> 17:53.864
I've been dying
to see that show.

17:53.947 --> 17:57.701
Well, they're my tickets
and I can take whoever I want.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.120
And I wanna take you, mommy.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.457
Ooh, here comes Ben.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.045
Uh, what do you think
you're doing?

18:08.128 --> 18:09.838
Oh, Ben.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.089
What are you doing here?

18:11.173 --> 18:12.674
You know I play here
every weekend.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.843
- Why is Vince kissing you?
- Let me handle it, Holly.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.762
The truth is, Ben,
I'm glad this finally happened.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.348
It's been a long time coming.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.351
Are you sure
you wanna do this, Vince?

18:22.434 --> 18:24.311
I have to do it, Holly.

18:24.394 --> 18:27.356
I mean, try being me watching
you two make out every day.

18:27.439 --> 18:30.067
"I love you."
"I love you more, blimey."

18:31.485 --> 18:34.655
It's been a nightmare.
I love her! She's mine!

18:34.738 --> 18:36.782
Okay, you're going
a little over the top, Vince.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.243
I haven't even begun.
I'm not acting.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.578
These are my real feelings.
Ever since you came back--

18:41.662 --> 18:44.790
Uh, Vince, Vince, you can stop
your acting now, man.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.500
Uh, everyone sees
through your lies

18:46.583 --> 18:48.001
and your
bigger-than-life acting.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.171
Stop now, please.

18:51.255 --> 18:52.798
Hey, thanks, Vince but I think

18:52.881 --> 18:56.218
that might have been
a really bad idea.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.720
You okay, dude?

18:58.804 --> 19:00.848
Unbelievable.

19:00.931 --> 19:04.434
I got to kiss her,
like, eight times.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.228
Ben.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.522
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is the backstage area.

19:08.605 --> 19:10.858
It's reserved for talent
and managers

19:10.941 --> 19:13.569
and girlfriends of talent.
You are none.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.529
Wait. I'm sorry.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.573
Vince and I were just
putting on a stupid act.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.741
I thought that maybe
if you saw us together

19:19.825 --> 19:21.076
you, I don't know,
get jealous.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.160
But that was stupid.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.912
I was jealous.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.707
Really? I thought you
didn't get jealous.

19:26.790 --> 19:27.833
I know. I can't believe it.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.084
I've never been jealous
in my life.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.586
What the hell are
you doing to me?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.546
Really? I made you jealous?

19:32.629 --> 19:34.089
Yes, and I don't like it.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.508
Okay, but now do you understand
what I was feeling?

19:36.592 --> 19:39.261
Yes. We're both sick.
This is not healthy, Holly.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.054
I don't care for it either.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.224
But it's who we are.
Welcome.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.477
I promise, I'm gonna try really
hard not to do that anymore

19:47.561 --> 19:50.772
because this is your career and
girls are gonna be all over you

19:50.856 --> 19:53.609
and I'm just gonna
have to get used to it.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.527
Okay, and I'm gonna have
to rise above it

19:55.611 --> 19:57.905
and not ask you who was
the better kisser, me or Vince?

20:01.658 --> 20:02.826
I'm waiting.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.454
God, when you get jealous,
you get jealous.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.205
