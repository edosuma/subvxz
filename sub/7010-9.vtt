06:46.656 --> 06:48.198
SHE'S MINE, RIGHT?

06:48.366 --> 06:50.117
WELL, I CAN SEE WHY
YOU'D THINK THAT,

06:50.284 --> 06:51.368
BUT ACTUALLY,

06:51.536 --> 06:53.036
SINCE I CAME ALONG
TO HELP YOU OUT,

06:53.204 --> 06:54.704
AMERICAN CUSTOM DICTATES

06:54.872 --> 06:56.873
THAT I GET THE BLONDE.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.125
ONCE AGAIN,

06:58.292 --> 07:01.420

07:21.482 --> 07:22.816
WELL, JACKIE, UH,

07:22.984 --> 07:24.067
IT'S JUST...

07:24.235 --> 07:25.902
I THOUGHT ALL YOU WANTED

07:26.070 --> 07:27.279
WAS TO PUT IN
ONE LITTLE ANIMAL.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.447
WELL, I KNOW, MICHAEL,

07:28.614 --> 07:29.656
BUT THIS WAY

07:29.824 --> 07:31.908
THERE'LL BE EVEN MORE
THINGS TO REMIND YOU OF ME.

07:32.076 --> 07:34.661
DON'T YOU LIKE

YOUR FEELINGS?

07:41.711 --> 07:43.670
OH. OKAY.

07:43.838 --> 07:47.424
I DON'T WANT YOUR STUPID

08:14.118 --> 08:15.368
AND HE LIES
ABOUT SMOKING,

08:15.536 --> 08:19.414
DOESN'T THAT MAKE
HIM A SMOKING LIAR?

08:20.458 --> 08:21.666
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S ENOUGH.

IF YOU KEEP ON SMOKING.

08:39.143 --> 08:41.061

10:19.327 --> 10:22.662
IT'S ALL A MAN HAS.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.749
WELL,
NOW THAT'S NICE.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.083
WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.794
LIGHT UP!

10:37.803 --> 10:39.012
HEY.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.347
I HEARD ERIC
GOT SUSPENDED.

10:40.514 --> 10:44.809
YEAH, AND WE'RE
ALL REAL PROUD.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.269
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, RED.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.729
I THINK DONNA'S
BEEN HAVING TROUBLE

10:47.897 --> 10:51.149
BECAUSE ERIC'S
A BAD INFLUENCE.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.360
COULD BE.

10:53.527 --> 10:54.611
BUT DID YOU EVER THINK

10:54.779 --> 10:56.237
THE WAY YOU AND MIDGE
ACT LIKE IDIOTS,

10:56.405 --> 11:01.493
THAT MIGHT BE
SCREWING HER UP?

11:01.661 --> 11:05.246
NOPE. I'M PRETTY
SURE IT'S ERIC.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.957
WELL, THAT'S
KIND OF STUPID, BOB.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.751
WELL, I GUESS
THE TRUTH HURTS.

11:09.919 --> 11:13.672
SO DOES A SWIFT
KICK IN THE ASS.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.465
ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING.

11:15.633 --> 11:16.716
BUT A SWIFT
KICK IN THE ASS

11:16.884 --> 11:18.385
IS NOT THE SOLUTION
TO EVERYTHING, FORMAN.

11:18.552 --> 11:23.556
I GOTTA DISAGREE, BOB.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.644
GEE, DAD. THANKS...

11:27.812 --> 11:29.521
KEEP SWEEPING, SMOKER.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.357
WILL DO.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.276
JACKIE, GET IN THE VAN!

11:35.444 --> 11:36.736
NO!

11:36.904 --> 11:37.987
JACKIE, GET IN THE VAN!

11:38.155 --> 11:39.280

11:39.448 --> 11:40.365

11:40.533 --> 11:41.408
JACKIE...

11:41.575 --> 11:44.327
JACKIE,
GET IN THE VAN!

11:56.424 --> 11:58.299
HEY.
HI.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.051
SO, WHADDAYA WANNA DO?

12:00.219 --> 12:01.511
YOU WANNA WATCH SOME T.V.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.346
OR EAT SOME ICE CREAM

12:03.514 --> 12:04.889
OR, I DON'T KNOW,

12:05.057 --> 12:08.351
APOLOGIZE TO ME?

12:08.519 --> 12:09.686
I'M SORRY.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.855
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.231
OKAY. I'M SORRY.

12:13.399 --> 12:17.068
I WAS EXPECTING
MORE OF A FIGHT.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.903
DID YOU GET IN A LOT OF
TROUBLE FOR THE CIGARETTE?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.613
UH, SURPRISINGLY, YES.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.116
TURNS OUT,
RED HAS A TEMPER, SO...

12:23.284 --> 12:24.534
REALLY?

12:24.702 --> 12:27.328
YEAH. WHO KNEW?

12:27.496 --> 12:28.705
AND...

12:28.873 --> 12:30.290
UH, YOUR DAD
DOESN'T LIKE ME ANYMORE.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.334
THAT'S OKAY, 'CAUSE I DO.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.009
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

12:41.177 --> 12:45.764
WHO?

12:46.724 --> 12:48.224
MAYBE... MAYBE YOU
SHOULD GET OFF ME

12:48.392 --> 12:51.102
SO I COULD, LIKE, RUN AWAY.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.062
YOU BETTER
GET OUT OF HERE.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.397
OKAY, FINE. I'LL
GET OUT OF HERE.

12:54.565 --> 12:55.398
ACTUALLY, I THINK
HE WAS TALKING TO ME.

12:55.566 --> 12:56.691
COME ON.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.443
OKAY. UH, BOY,
THIS IS AWKWARD

12:58.611 --> 13:02.405
WITH THE DONNA AND
THE YELLING AND THE...

13:05.910 --> 13:07.035
SO THEN
MY PASTOR SAID

13:07.203 --> 13:08.661
IT'S OKAY TO GET A "B"
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

13:08.829 --> 13:09.996
NOBODY'S
PERFECT,

13:10.164 --> 13:11.498
EXCEPT...

13:11.665 --> 13:14.083
YOU KNOW WHO.

13:15.002 --> 13:18.004
YOU KNOW, IT'S
JUST SO REFRESHING

13:18.172 --> 13:20.632
TO MEET SOMEONE
WHOSE BELIEFS

13:20.800 --> 13:22.926
ARE THE COMPLETE
OPPOSITE OF MINE.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.552
I KNOW. WELL,
I'M EPISCOPALIAN,

13:24.720 --> 13:26.179
AND MY BEST FRIEND'S
PRESBYTERIAN,

13:26.347 --> 13:28.223
BUT WE'RE STILL
BEST FRIENDS.

13:28.390 --> 13:32.602
IT'S HARD WORK,
BUT IT'S WORTH IT.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.230
I BET YOU MAKE
REALLY GOOD PUNCH, HUH?

13:35.397 --> 13:36.523
OH, MY GOSH.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.024
THE BEST.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.317
YEAH, I MEAN,
THESE TEACHERS

13:39.485 --> 13:41.236
THINK THEY DESERVE OUR
RESPECT, BUT THEY DON'T.

13:41.403 --> 13:44.197
I MEAN, WHO ARE THEY TO TEACH
US ABOUT HISTORY AND MATH?

13:44.365 --> 13:49.953
HMM. I, TOO, AM FILLED WITH
REBELLIOUS SEXUAL TENSION.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.121
YEAH.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.373
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
MALCOLM X SAID,

13:53.541 --> 13:54.833
BY ANY MEANS
NECESSARY. RIGHT?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.251
YOU LIKE MALCOLM X?

13:56.418 --> 13:57.585
HEY, WHO DOESN'T
LIKE MALCOLM X, HUH?

13:57.753 --> 13:59.003
[LAUGHS]

13:59.171 --> 14:00.338
YOU'VE HEARD OF
MALCOLM X IN PANAMA?

14:00.506 --> 14:02.131
OH, NO. I'M NOT
FROM PANAMA. I'M FROM...

14:02.299 --> 14:06.094
HEY, FEZ,

HAVE THE BLONDE.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.225
OH, MY GOD.

14:12.393 --> 14:15.019
BLONDES ARE
NOTORIOUS WHORES.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.771
THANK YOU, HYDE.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.107

14:42.214 --> 14:43.339

14:44.675 --> 14:46.551
I'M JUST
GONNA LEAVE NOW.

14:46.719 --> 14:47.927
BYE.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.221

15:07.698 --> 15:12.452
YEAH. NATURAL.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.786

BANDS THAT I LIKE.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.290
YEAH.
I JUST LIKE MUSIC

15:17.458 --> 15:18.541
THAT'S PASSIONATE
AND REBELLIOUS

15:18.709 --> 15:21.127
AND REALLY
PISSES OFF MY DAD.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.587
OH, PATTY,
DON'T SAY PISS.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.965
OH!

15:26.133 --> 15:29.052
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT'D
REALLY PISS OFF YOUR DAD?

15:29.219 --> 15:30.511

15:32.932 --> 15:33.973
OH, I CAN'T.

15:34.141 --> 15:35.183
I HAVE A BIG
TEST TOMORROW.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.434
THAT'S FUNNY.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.145
LET'S GO.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.439
NO, REALLY.
I'VE GOTTA GO STUDY.

15:41.607 --> 15:42.941
STUDY?

15:43.108 --> 15:46.069
YOU DON'T STUDY.
YOU'VE GOT A TATTOO.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.862
LOOK, HYDE, REBELLION
IS COOL AND ALL,

15:48.030 --> 15:49.530
BUT I WANT TO GET
INTO A GOOD COLLEGE

15:49.698 --> 15:51.741
SO I CAN FIGHT THE
SYSTEM FROM THE INSIDE.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.159
IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU, THOUGH.

15:53.327 --> 15:54.452
MARY?

15:54.620 --> 15:56.663
OH, NO. GO AHEAD
WITHOUT ME.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.122
SO, FEZ, UM,

15:58.290 --> 15:59.415
MY PARENTS

15:59.583 --> 16:00.708

16:00.876 --> 16:04.337
I HAVE A HOT TUB.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.718
THAT WOULD BE SUPER.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.479
DONNA, IS IT ME, OR...

16:21.647 --> 16:25.233
DOES YOUR DAD HATING ME
MAKE ME EVEN MORE SEXY?

16:26.944 --> 16:29.112
SURE.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.571
YEAH...

16:30.739 --> 16:33.950
I THINK HE SENSES
MY BAD-BOYNESS.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.910
YEAH, ERIC, YOU'RE A
PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.578
YES.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.957
YES, I AM.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.300
MOM, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

16:51.468 --> 16:53.428
NOTHING.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.638
AND YOU... YOU JUST...

16:55.806 --> 16:58.182
YOU DO AS I SAY,
NOT AS I DO.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.893
OH, HEY, MOM, COOL.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.062
GIVE ME A DRAG.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.148
OKAY, SEE? NOW LAURIE

17:05.315 --> 17:08.484
THAT IS WRONG.

17:08.652 --> 17:11.529
Red: WHAT'S GOING
ON OUT HERE?

17:11.697 --> 17:15.491
ERIC, ARE YOU
SMOKING AGAIN?

17:15.659 --> 17:17.660
I THINK HE IS, DADDY.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.287
NO, HE IS NOT.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.747
I DON'T SMOKE!

17:20.914 --> 17:22.331
I THINK THIS
MIGHT BE MY FAULT.

17:22.499 --> 17:23.499
I THINK HE IS...

17:23.667 --> 17:27.837
HE'S JUST IMITATING ME
SO HE CAN LOOK COOL.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.381
MR. AND MRS. FORMAN,

17:30.549 --> 17:32.884
ERIC GOT CAUGHT HOLDING
MY CIGARETTE AT SCHOOL.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.387
I'M THE ONE
WHO WAS SMOKING.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.432
OH?

17:40.768 --> 17:41.893
WELL, DONNA,

17:42.061 --> 17:43.144
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR HONESTY.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.353

17:45.939 --> 17:48.149
I TOLD YOU
I DON'T SMOKE.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.650
OKAY. I'M GONNA

17:49.818 --> 17:52.570
SO, UH, GOOD NIGHT.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.574
ERIC'S NOT
IN TROUBLE NOW?

17:57.159 --> 17:59.452
FINE.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.454
WELL, NOW.

18:01.622 --> 18:04.165
I THINK YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY TO ERIC.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.751
OH, YEAH, UH...

18:07.419 --> 18:08.711

BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU DO LIE A LOT.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.517
WHAT HAVE I LIED ABOUT?

18:22.684 --> 18:24.102
YOU'VE LIED

18:27.523 --> 18:29.357
YOU WEREN'T TAKING
THE CAR OUT OF TOWN.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.733
WAIT.
YOU KNEW ABOUT THAT?

18:30.901 --> 18:31.943
I DO NOW.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.529
OH!
HAH!

18:34.696 --> 18:35.696

18:42.538 --> 18:44.622

18:46.875 --> 18:49.377
YEAH. THAT'S OKAY.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.130
ACTUALLY,

18:52.798 --> 18:54.132
WATCH IT.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.260

19:12.943 --> 19:14.193
I GIVE UP!

19:14.361 --> 19:17.238
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR
STUFFED ANIMALS IN THE VAN.

19:17.406 --> 19:20.158
DO YOU REALLY MEAN IT?

19:20.325 --> 19:21.576
YEAH.

SO, YOU HAVE ME

19:42.973 --> 19:44.849
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO
SEND A SEXY MESSAGE,

19:45.017 --> 19:47.894
THEN MESSAGE RECEIVED.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.645
WELL, FEZ...

19:49.813 --> 19:51.397
I KNOW WE MADE OUT
IN MY PARENT'S BEDROOM,

19:51.565 --> 19:54.066
AND I KNOW WE FRENCHED
IN THE POOL HOUSE,

19:54.234 --> 19:57.570
AND I KNOW THAT MAY SEEM
ROMANTIC TO SOME PEOPLE...

19:57.738 --> 20:00.781
TELL ME SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.951
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.623
SEE? THAT I DID NOT KNOW.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.082
FEZ, I REALLY
LIKE YOU, BUT...

20:10.250 --> 20:11.459
HE'S IN COLLEGE,

20:11.627 --> 20:13.127
AND WE'RE
STILL FAITHFUL.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.296
I SEE.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.006
YOU KNOW...

20:17.174 --> 20:19.050
THERE ARE MANY WAYS
TO REMAIN FAITHFUL

20:19.218 --> 20:21.093
YET STILL HAVE FUN.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.220
REALLY?

20:22.387 --> 20:24.430
OH, YES.

20:28.018 --> 20:30.519
AHH...

20:30.687 --> 20:33.105
THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

20:37.986 --> 20:41.280
HEY.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.866
SO...

20:44.034 --> 20:45.201
I TOLD BOB AND MIDGE

20:45.369 --> 20:47.078
THAT IT WAS
MY CIGARETTE.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.746
AND HOW'D THAT GO?

20:48.914 --> 20:52.208
REALLY GOOD.
THEY GROUNDED ME.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.293
COOL. HA HA.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.753
SO WHAT ARE YOU
DOING OVER HERE?

20:55.921 --> 20:57.546
SNUCK OUT.

20:57.714 --> 20:58.756
BEING GROUNDED
MAKES IT

20:58.924 --> 21:02.218
SO MUCH NAUGHTIER.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.012
YOU KNOW, DONNA,

21:05.180 --> 21:07.473
I'M NOT GONNA
TELL YOU WHAT TO DO,

21:07.641 --> 21:08.891
BUT...

21:09.059 --> 21:10.393
FAILING CLASSES
IS NOT THE ONLY WAY

21:10.560 --> 21:11.727
TO GET ATTENTION
FROM YOUR PARENTS.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.020
I MEAN...

21:13.188 --> 21:14.272
FOR INSTANCE,
A LOT OF GIRLS,

21:14.439 --> 21:15.606
WHEN THEY'RE HAVING
A BAD TIME AT HOME,

21:15.774 --> 21:17.233
JUST...

21:17.401 --> 21:20.152
GO SLUTTY.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.115
YOU KNOW WHAT, ERIC?

21:24.283 --> 21:25.700
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.368
LET'S HAVE SEX
RIGHT NOW.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.703

NO.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.372

21:40.590 --> 21:41.841

21:42.009 --> 21:43.050

21:43.218 --> 21:44.343

21:47.180 --> 21:48.222

22:01.570 --> 22:02.945
HEY.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.155
NO, WAIT! JACKIE!

22:04.323 --> 22:06.407
