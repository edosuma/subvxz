WEBVTT

00:51.634 --> 00:53.011
I'm just like them."

02:39.284 --> 02:40.535
We flew her every week.

02:41.536 --> 02:43.496
What a commitment.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.855
Is this an exam?

05:06.723 --> 05:07.557
Splits!

05:13.688 --> 05:15.273
I feel like my legs are stuck.

05:35.376 --> 05:37.086
-But you're good for tonight?
- Yeah.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.915
You could be
a little more aggressive

09:00.998 --> 09:02.708
coming out of your handsprings.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.565
Don't think about mat.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.447
It's what I just tried.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.409
You're stressing yourself out now.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.829
I know what it feels like
to be so stressed out about mat.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.290
Relax! You're doing what you need
to be doing, Okay?

09:42.373 --> 09:44.959
Nothing's stopping you
except your brain.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.503
So, go in there,
go in the bathroom, cry it out,

09:47.587 --> 09:48.754
wash your face off.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.589
I love him.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.043
We gotta get that in there.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.583
Who'd you lose to?

27:12.213 --> 27:13.673
Are we starting with stunts?

33:26.045 --> 33:27.797
Do you think you're gonna make mat?

33:29.424 --> 33:31.092
I think you got it.

34:03.499 --> 34:05.501
How long are you back by the way?

44:13.275 --> 44:15.569
He's always done
that funky step out like that.

44:24.870 --> 44:26.288
That was definitely a minus

44:26.413 --> 44:28.040
cause his toes
were not pointing on that one.

44:28.123 --> 44:30.125
He's an inconsistent tumbler.

44:59.863 --> 45:01.073
This is probably not gonna be good.

45:07.079 --> 45:08.706
Her jumps are not very good.

45:31.437 --> 45:32.813
Mm! Crispy clean.

46:12.811 --> 46:15.272
I really wanted to warm up
before I go.

46:15.355 --> 46:17.524
I feel like I might...  I don't know.

46:18.984 --> 46:21.904
-I'm just overthinking.
-Yeah, just don't think about it.

46:22.571 --> 46:23.447
You know what to do.

46:30.162 --> 46:31.371
Incredible.

46:43.467 --> 46:44.968
Oh, she's such a beast.

46:58.065 --> 47:00.526
And we need to have Morgan go.
I want to see her toes.

47:29.388 --> 47:30.848
Did y'all just drop her again?

47:31.598 --> 47:32.808
What are y'all doing?

48:51.136 --> 48:52.846
Well, it's no worse than Allie's.

51:38.136 --> 51:39.721
Just learn La'Darius's routine.

51:40.889 --> 51:41.848
Minus the tumbling.

51:52.734 --> 51:54.694
I could learn the stunting spot.
Yeah, that's easy.
