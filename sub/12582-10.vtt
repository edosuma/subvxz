WEBVTT

00:33.825 --> 00:35.076
To Travis.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.872
May you have as many sick days
in retirement as you had

00:38.955 --> 00:42.500
in your 40 years working
at Strickland Propane.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.668
Which is three.

00:43.752 --> 00:44.961
Speech! Speech!

00:45.045 --> 00:47.297
Yeah, come on ol' boy. Go ahead.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.339


00:48.423 --> 00:50.383
Well, it's funny.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.802
This was just supposed
to be a two-week gig

00:52.886 --> 00:54.804
until I got my pilot's license.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.557
But I guess, like so many other dreams,

00:57.640 --> 01:00.769
time has a way of slipping
through your fingers and...

01:06.316 --> 01:07.400
Cake?

01:07.484 --> 01:09.486
-Cake's good.
-And tasty. Yeah!

01:09.569 --> 01:11.696
Mm, this is delicious.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.615
Travis didn't want to take this home?

01:13.698 --> 01:15.325
No, he's a diabetic.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.202
The cake was just for ceremony.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.953
Hmm, diabetic, huh?

01:19.037 --> 01:21.748
Well, Travis does not know
what he's missing.

01:21.831 --> 01:25.293
Yep, the new guy starts Monday,
and I'm kinda nervous for him.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.545
It can't be easy coming in as a rookie

01:27.629 --> 01:29.214
to a championship team.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.340
Now, that's true.

01:30.423 --> 01:33.676
Thirteen years later,
Lady Bird still has it out for Bobby.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.553
What?

01:36.888 --> 01:38.807
Well, who wants coffee?

01:41.184 --> 01:44.562
So the thing about working here is,
we treat all our customers

01:44.646 --> 01:47.232
like they're purchasing
a Vogner Imperiale,

01:47.315 --> 01:49.484
even if they can only afford the Citizen.

01:49.567 --> 01:52.070
Oh, and even though
the display food is plastic

01:52.153 --> 01:55.198
we still like you to wash your hands
before handling it.

01:55.281 --> 01:58.409
Wow, this sure is a world away
from Taco Bueno.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.911
You've got 40 years.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.454
You'll get the swing of it.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.040
Well, I'll let you hit
the books there, "rookie."

02:07.669 --> 02:12.799


02:12.882 --> 02:15.260
Whistling was Travis's thing.

02:15.343 --> 02:16.719
Oh. Sorry.

02:16.803 --> 02:17.887
That's okay, Rich.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.889
You had no way of knowing that.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.894
Thanks for the coupon
to the Olive Garden, Hank.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.063
The "Tour of Italy" was delicious.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.357
Hey, Rich, why don't you pull up a chair?

02:29.440 --> 02:30.275
That's okay.

02:30.358 --> 02:31.442
You got a full table.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.819
I'll just eat in my car.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.404
Nonsense. We'll make room.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.324
Oh, yeah. Squeeze in.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.995
We were just talking
about the Olive Garden, Rich.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.746
Oh, I love that place.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.165
They got a couple of waitresses

02:45.248 --> 02:47.542
I wouldn't kick out of bed
for eating lasagna...

02:47.625 --> 02:48.751
if you get what I'm saying.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.465
Uh, Rich, could you give me a hand

02:54.549 --> 02:57.093
unloading those
meat thermometers out back?

02:57.177 --> 02:58.011
Sure.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.430
So, where do you want me?

03:00.513 --> 03:03.099
There are no meat thermometers
out here, Rich.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.852
I just made that up
to save you the embarrassment.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.270
I think you might've learned

03:07.353 --> 03:10.315
-some bad habits at Taco Bueno.
-Oh, yeah?

03:10.398 --> 03:13.735
That comment about the, uh, the lasagna.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.111
Well, here at Strickland,

03:15.236 --> 03:16.821
we try not to say things

03:16.905 --> 03:19.240
that are not funny and also disgusting.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.867
Oh, I crossed the line. I'm sorry.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.535
It was just off the cuff.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.786
I thought Donna laughed.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.371
Well, she was being polite.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.624
That's why we keep her at the front desk.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.375
Uh, I didn't think she was just being...

03:30.627 --> 03:32.378
You know what? Doesn't matter.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.463
Rules are rules.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.547
Attaboy, Rich.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.882
You'll do just fine.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.680
"Eating lasagna in bed."

03:46.017 --> 03:46.893
Hey, Rich...

03:46.976 --> 03:49.437
you get those meat thermometers put away?

03:49.520 --> 03:52.565
Uh, yeah, except
for the one I got right here.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.442
You stole a meat therm...

03:54.525 --> 03:55.443
Oh!

03:57.654 --> 03:59.822
Hey, can you toss me that back brace?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.991
I got some heavy lifting to do here.

04:02.075 --> 04:02.909
Me too.

04:02.992 --> 04:03.826
Where's the urinal?

04:06.871 --> 04:08.331
That was Moretti's Grill.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.833
They're having problems
with the burners again.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.543
I need an eight-inch L-pipe.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.504
That's what "she" said.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.132
Oh, did their hostess call, too?

04:19.842 --> 04:20.718
Uh, yeah.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.137
Huh. Oh, here's one.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.223
Well, I should be back by three.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.100
I hope the threading's not stripped.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.726
I mean, if I have to do it manually,

04:28.810 --> 04:30.311
I'll be down there for hours.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.230
That's what she said... right?

04:32.313 --> 04:33.481
Yes, Enrique.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.109
That is exactly what she said.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.115
Yeah, uh...

04:42.198 --> 04:43.616
I don't know why I'm laughing.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.119
Sounds like I'm gonna be
down there all night.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.121
<i>It was really weird.</i>

04:48.204 --> 04:50.623
I showed up at Moretti's Grill
to do some work,

04:50.707 --> 04:52.625
and the hostess didn't
even know I was coming.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.877
Hostesses can be very flighty.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.130
That's why they only let them carry menus.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.590
Yeah, but before I left the office,

04:59.674 --> 05:02.844
the new guy made it sound
like she was on top of everything.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.846
Heck, even as I was heading out the door,

05:04.929 --> 05:07.098
I just mentioned that
I hoped my cordless drill

05:07.181 --> 05:08.516
had enough juice for the job,

05:08.599 --> 05:11.269
and Rich said, "That's what she said,"

05:11.352 --> 05:15.940
and then everybody high-fived and... oh...

05:16.024 --> 05:19.235
Oh, no. It was an "intimate" joke!

05:19.319 --> 05:20.987
God, Joe Jack was laughing,

05:21.070 --> 05:22.655
and Donna was laughing.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.574
I've never seen them laugh so hard.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.118
Yes, people do love the off-color jokes.

05:27.201 --> 05:29.954
You would not believe
how many times the kids ask me

05:30.038 --> 05:32.040
how to say poo-poo in Spanish.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.124
Ugh.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.418
It's <i>la tierra de la trasero.</i>

05:35.501 --> 05:38.421
The literal translation
is "earth of the butt."

05:38.504 --> 05:40.631
I made it up but the kids seem to like it.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.300
And how!

05:43.551 --> 05:44.385
Yep.

05:44.969 --> 05:45.845
Yup.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.722
Mmm-hmm.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.182
It's official.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.516
I've quit smoking.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.768
I'm off the junk.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.311
Well, good for you, Dale.

05:53.394 --> 05:54.479
What brought this on?

05:54.562 --> 05:56.439
Oh, Nancy's been naggin' me

05:56.522 --> 05:58.274
ever since our bed caught fire.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.443
I went a little heavy on the aftershave,

06:00.526 --> 06:02.236
lit one up, and kaboom.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.696
Check out my eyebrows.

06:03.780 --> 06:04.989
It's mascara.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.324
Well, congratulations.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.618
I know how hard it is to quit smoking.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.120
Not with my nifty little miracle cure.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.414
Yes, gentlemen, it crushes the craving

06:13.498 --> 06:16.250
without any
of the undesirable side effects.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.172
Chewing tobacco?

06:21.255 --> 06:23.132
That's disgusting.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.135
Will someone please tell me
what happened to good manners?

06:26.219 --> 06:27.762
It's like this new guy at work.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.890
He turns every little comment
into a vulgarity.

06:30.973 --> 06:31.933
It's awful.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.101
I'll tell you what, man.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.019
It's like the dang ol' world
has become a sewer, man.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.271
Like with them shock jocks,
and them rappers, too, man.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.440
Like, got ol' Miss Manners' panties
in a bunch, man.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.400
You're right.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.861
I can't believe the filth
they're putting on TV these days.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.239
And they just beam it right into my home.

06:46.322 --> 06:49.867
I hit the pay-per-view button
and there it is, right in front of me!

06:49.951 --> 06:53.079
Well, that's life
in the 21st century for you.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.872
We just have to learn to accept it.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.377
Accept it, Bill.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.047
Well, crudeness might be
"cool" everywhere else,

07:03.131 --> 07:05.049
but I won't accept it in my home,

07:05.133 --> 07:08.010
and I certainly won't accept it
in my home away from home.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.555
From now on at Strickland Propane,

07:10.638 --> 07:12.640
"she" is going to say nothing.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.100
That's what I said!

07:16.686 --> 07:17.895
Hey, someone tickle me.

07:17.979 --> 07:20.231
I want to make this stuff
come out my nose.

07:23.025 --> 07:24.402
Hey, Donna,

07:24.527 --> 07:25.987
listen to the new nickname

07:26.070 --> 07:27.947
that Rich thought up for Enrique.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.782
You mean, "Enri-gay?"

07:31.826 --> 07:33.744
Man, you could be on <i>Mad TV.</i>

07:33.828 --> 07:36.247
Yeah, but then I couldn't hang out here
with you and Joe Jack.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.332
Or should I say "Low Crack?"

07:38.416 --> 07:39.876
Pull up your pants
before I drop a quarter in there

07:39.959 --> 07:40.877
and make a phone call.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.796
Hey, what's the matter, Low Crack?

07:43.880 --> 07:44.881
Can't you take a joke?

07:44.964 --> 07:45.965
I can take it.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.050
-That's what she said!
-That's what she said.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.218
Oh, man!

07:49.302 --> 07:52.305
Okay, someone wanna tell me
what's so funny here?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.601
Maybe you should ask Enri-gay?

07:56.684 --> 07:58.394
You'd know better than me, Low Crack!

07:59.437 --> 08:01.898
No. No. That is not funny.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.233
It's the kind of thing
a first-grader would say,

08:04.317 --> 08:06.360
and then he'd get his mouth
washed out with soap.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.196
Now, this is a place of work,

08:08.279 --> 08:11.157
so I want this behavior to stop right now.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.869
It's crude, unprofessional,
and just plain not funny.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.330
Is there a problem here, Hank?

08:17.413 --> 08:20.583
Nope. We were just having
a little discussion on office decorum.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.792
Nothing I can't handle.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.419
Well, all right, then.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.254
Y'all should be well-advised

08:25.338 --> 08:26.672
to do what this man tells you.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.675
He is my proxy when I am in absentia.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.345
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate you getting behind me.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.138
That's what she said.

08:38.976 --> 08:40.186
"Get... get behind me."

08:41.562 --> 08:43.022
Ooo-wee!

08:43.105 --> 08:45.316
That's funny! Damn, you quick, boy!

08:45.399 --> 08:46.901
That's what she said... about Joe Jack!

08:49.612 --> 08:52.323
Stop! Stop! No! No! No! Don't stop!

08:52.406 --> 08:54.659
That's what she said!

08:54.742 --> 08:56.160
Sir, no!

08:56.244 --> 08:57.578
You're funnier than that comedian

08:57.662 --> 08:59.080
that ruined <i>Monday Night Football.</i>

09:10.174 --> 09:12.552
Here's my specimen sample, honey.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.349
I'm doin' stuff!

09:25.731 --> 09:26.983
Good Lord, Ol' Top!

09:27.066 --> 09:28.234
What you doing in there?

09:28.317 --> 09:30.027
No, no. That was not me.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.449
It's not funny.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.536
And a waste of a perfectly good
nine-volt battery.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.163
How do the Chinese let themselves

09:41.247 --> 09:43.374
get talked into making these things?

09:43.457 --> 09:47.378
Hoo! What did do for fun
before we had one of these?

09:53.134 --> 09:54.802
Yeah. Quitting smoking

09:54.885 --> 09:56.554
is the best thing I've ever done.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.888
Check this out.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.773
A couple of days ago,
that would have killed me.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.234
Hey, Hank.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.360
Don't you want a beer?

10:11.444 --> 10:14.405
What I want
is a professional working environment,

10:14.488 --> 10:17.241
where it's hard work
that earns your colleagues' respect,

10:17.325 --> 10:20.453
not the ability to rhyme your name
with a body part.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.121
You got that in your cooler, Bill?

10:22.204 --> 10:24.373
If I check, you're gonna
make fun of me, right?

10:28.753 --> 10:30.171
Was that Hank?

10:30.254 --> 10:32.340
I blacked out there for a second.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.508
<i>I don't get it.</i>

10:34.592 --> 10:35.843
What is so funny

10:35.926 --> 10:38.804
about putting a prophylactic
on my Maglite?

10:38.888 --> 10:40.431
Not the Maglite

10:40.514 --> 10:42.058
I gave you for Christmas?

10:42.141 --> 10:43.434
Well, needless to say,

10:43.517 --> 10:45.186
it went straight into the garbage.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.228
Dad,

10:46.312 --> 10:48.814
I've dealt with a lot
of bullies in my day,

10:48.898 --> 10:51.859
and I've learned
that the most effective strategy

10:51.942 --> 10:54.028
is to fight fire with fire.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.948
Whoopee cushions? Plastic vomit?

10:58.032 --> 11:00.284
I thought I banned these things
from the house.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.370
Dad, now is not the time.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.121
Poo in a can!

11:04.205 --> 11:06.374
Remember that creep Pete Sheldon?

11:06.457 --> 11:08.626
The wet Willie guy? Well...

11:08.709 --> 11:11.295
A little dab of this on his chair, and...

11:11.379 --> 11:15.174
let's just say his new nickname
is "Peter Pantload."

11:18.636 --> 11:20.137
Hey, what are you doing?

11:20.221 --> 11:21.931
I'm throwing this stuff out.

11:22.014 --> 11:25.059
When you stoop to their level,
you're no better than they are.

11:25.142 --> 11:27.186
At least leave me the fake barf.

11:27.269 --> 11:28.896
I've got gym tomorrow!

11:33.651 --> 11:35.069
All righty!

11:35.152 --> 11:36.779
Ready to hit the links, Old Top?

11:36.862 --> 11:38.656
Don't wanna keep the clients waiting.

11:38.739 --> 11:39.615
You kidding, sir?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.367
I've been looking forward to it all week.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.077
Oh, yeah.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.286
About that, Hank.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.288
What? You're taking him?

11:46.372 --> 11:48.708
He can't handle the Vista Village account.

11:48.791 --> 11:51.669
Tell me the difference between
a Positive Placement Pump

11:51.794 --> 11:53.462
and a Vertical Turbine Pump.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.547
Um...

11:55.172 --> 11:56.590
I know the placement of my pump.

11:56.674 --> 11:57.925
And, when I see your mama...

11:58.008 --> 11:59.510
That's it! I'm kicking your ass!

11:59.593 --> 12:00.469
Ooh!

12:00.553 --> 12:01.721
Now, who's the potty mouth?

12:01.804 --> 12:03.389
Now, get hold of yourself, Hank.

12:03.472 --> 12:04.974
This ain't no fraternity party.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.767
You can't go around hitting people.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.519
Come on, Rich. Let's ske-doo.

12:08.602 --> 12:09.603
Don't worry, boss.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.021
I'll wow these guys.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.190
I worked up this great little bit
with the ball washer.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.525
And I can't wait to see it!

12:38.132 --> 12:40.801
Hey, you made a lane change
without signaling!

12:42.553 --> 12:44.847
Thanks for seeing me, Mrs. Borginnis.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.266
It's Ms. Borginnis, but, yes, I'm married.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.310
And Borginnis is my husband's name.

12:49.393 --> 12:50.478
Uh...

12:50.561 --> 12:52.313
So why don't you tell me your problem?

12:52.396 --> 12:55.232
Well, as you can probably tell
from my jacket

12:55.316 --> 12:57.067
and my hat and my shirt,

12:57.151 --> 13:00.112
I sell propane and propane accessories.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.781
-Uh-huh.
-Now, don't get me wrong.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.908
I have the best job in the world.

13:03.991 --> 13:07.912
But this guy Rich has been
making a lot of, uh, jokes.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.830
Jokes? What kind of jokes?

13:09.914 --> 13:11.874
Knock-knock? Ding-dong?
What are we talking about?

13:11.957 --> 13:16.212
Uh... jokes that, uh...
you know, use vulgarity.

13:19.131 --> 13:22.927
You know, jokes about
morning nature functions.

13:23.010 --> 13:26.180
Plus, I can't say the word
"meat" without someone giggling.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.973
And, yesterday, someone took my

13:28.057 --> 13:31.101
"Employee of the Month" picture
and drew a beard on it.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.978
But not where you think.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.564
Pervasive pattern of demeaning behavior,

13:35.648 --> 13:38.192
hostile work environment
affecting job performance.

13:38.275 --> 13:41.821
Mr. Hill, I believe we have
a strong case for a lawsuit

13:41.904 --> 13:44.198
based on male-on-male sexual harassment.

13:44.281 --> 13:46.659
Male-on-male sexual harassment?

13:46.742 --> 13:47.910
Ugh! No!

13:47.993 --> 13:51.747
Look, sexual harassment
is just an umbrella term

13:51.831 --> 13:54.208
that covers a wide variety of offenses.

13:54.291 --> 13:57.628
Do you validate,
or am I stuck for the 75 cents?

13:57.711 --> 14:00.381
Please, just take this literature.

14:00.464 --> 14:03.425
You know what?
I'll pay the 75 cents myself.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.594
Oh! Propane emergency.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.264
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
to commandeer your phone.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.600
This is Hank Hill, Strickland Propane.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.770
<i>Yes. I'd like to report a gas leak.</i>

14:14.854 --> 14:17.648
Oh, okay. Just remain calm,
and tell me where it is.

14:17.731 --> 14:20.401
<i>It's... in your pants!</i>

14:21.986 --> 14:23.904
<i>Hang up, Old Top,
or he'll know it's us!</i>

14:26.365 --> 14:27.533
Ms. Borginnis,

14:27.616 --> 14:29.410
I'll take that literature.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.624
<i>See? Sexual harassment</i>

14:35.708 --> 14:37.001
is an umbrella term.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.335
It doesn't just cover women,

14:38.419 --> 14:42.882
but also men
and... "transgender individuals."

14:44.133 --> 14:46.343
Hank, you'll be a trailblazer.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.554
Now, I know it is not fun being the first,

14:48.637 --> 14:51.724
but it may mean you could be the last.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.559
That's a great line for the movie.

14:53.642 --> 14:56.562
Jo Beth Williams will knock it out
of the park.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.320
Ass tag! Hoo-hoo!

15:04.403 --> 15:07.281
Take that...

15:07.364 --> 15:09.033
Hey, ha-ha! You're it!

15:11.952 --> 15:13.120
Hey, Enrique.

15:13.203 --> 15:14.705
I didn't know you were married
to a monkey.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.499
What happened to the picture of my wife?

15:17.583 --> 15:19.251
I don't know.
Did you check the men's room?

15:26.508 --> 15:28.928
I'm married to a monkey.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.183
I gotta make this quick, but I love you.

15:35.267 --> 15:36.602
Wait. Someone's coming.

15:38.062 --> 15:38.979
Oh, Hank.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.147
-I was just--
-Shh.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.649
We don't have much time.

15:41.732 --> 15:42.983
I've been watching you.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.153
You don't think any of this Rich stuff
is funny, either, do you?

15:46.236 --> 15:48.530
What do you mean? I think he...

15:48.614 --> 15:50.991
Ah, I hate it. I hate it!

15:51.075 --> 15:52.368
I don't wanna come to work.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.786
I have nightmares.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.663
I can't even eat a hot dog anymore.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.415
Well, I think I know how we can stop it.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.794
I talked with this lawyer
who thinks we can sue for...

16:01.877 --> 16:07.007
uh, you know, uh,
male-on-male sexual harassment.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.550
Sexual harassment?

16:08.634 --> 16:10.052
It's an umbrella term.

16:10.135 --> 16:13.222
You and me suing for sexual harassment?

16:15.265 --> 16:16.725
I'm sorry, Hank.

16:21.021 --> 16:24.316
Hey, Enrique, look who just
came out of the closet.

16:30.614 --> 16:31.448
Yep.

16:31.532 --> 16:32.574
Yep.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.534
Mm-hmm.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.621
What you got there?

16:37.705 --> 16:39.581
Oh, Nancy's at it again.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.875
Now she's got some new rule

16:41.959 --> 16:43.669
about spitting on the carpet,

16:43.752 --> 16:45.963
so now I have to stuff my chewing tobacco

16:46.046 --> 16:48.632
into this paper cone and inhale the aroma.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.219
Not...

16:52.302 --> 16:53.929
...really...

16:54.013 --> 16:55.055
...working.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.937
Boomhauer, you're a genius.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.314
What should we call this new invention?

17:04.398 --> 17:05.816
Well, I guess that's a night.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.403
Back to the potty factory tomorrow.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.406
Did Hank get a new job?

17:26.420 --> 17:27.463
I'm choking!

17:27.546 --> 17:29.298
Need something to drink.

17:31.925 --> 17:33.969
Ass tag time-out.

17:34.053 --> 17:37.765
Hey, I didn't get a time-out
when I cut my thumb open.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.308
Come on, guys, have a heart.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.310
Joe Jack's choking. Time out.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.316
Hey, here you go, Joe Jack.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.484
Have a soda.

17:52.362 --> 17:53.697
Nice try.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.033
Yeah, I think I got a clogged nozzle.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.409
Can you guys take a look?

17:57.493 --> 17:59.036
This man needs to be serviced.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.080
Would you like to service
this man, Enrique?

18:01.163 --> 18:02.456
Uh, no.

18:02.539 --> 18:05.000
Look, I got the extended warranty.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.960
Extended, huh?

18:09.213 --> 18:10.589
To hell with this.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.633
Good morning, sir. Are you being helped?

18:12.716 --> 18:14.843
You're the ones who need help.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.228
Hoo-hoo!

18:24.311 --> 18:25.312
That does it.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.980
This is a place of business

18:27.064 --> 18:29.108
and you've turned it into a cesspool.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.526
Lighten up, Mrs. Hill.

18:30.609 --> 18:31.735
We're just having fun.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.281
No, you're having fun. But I'm not.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.992
And I know for a fact
that Enrique hates it.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.706
Joe Jack, you've been coughing
since I walked in here

18:44.790 --> 18:47.334
because you're too scared
to get up and get a drink.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.754
Ha-ha, choking to death is real funny.

18:50.838 --> 18:51.839
Look at us.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.341
Wallowing in our own filthy behavior.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.970
So bent on being crass
we can't even trust each other.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.639
Sure, it's done in the name of comedy,

19:00.722 --> 19:04.101
but is debasing ourselves
really that hilarious?

19:04.184 --> 19:07.312
Don't you wish we could
still say words like "meat"

19:07.396 --> 19:09.731
and "tool" and "unit"

19:09.815 --> 19:12.734
without someone turning it
into something foul?

19:12.818 --> 19:14.695
Those are our words.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.405
I say let's take 'em back.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.076
Even if we do agree with you, honey,

19:21.160 --> 19:22.536
Buck thinks it's funny,

19:22.619 --> 19:24.580
and he's the one signing our paychecks.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.500
Hank, wow.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.128
I guess I didn't realize
how bad you felt about this.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.839
But there's something
else you don't realize.

19:33.922 --> 19:34.965
You are open.

19:35.048 --> 19:37.176
Ass tag!

19:37.259 --> 19:38.260
How about it?

19:38.343 --> 19:40.804
Let's hear it
for the number one "ass-assin"!

19:40.888 --> 19:42.389
That does it.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.892
I don't care what Buck
or anyone else thinks,

19:44.975 --> 19:47.519
I'm gonna do what your mom
should have done

19:47.603 --> 19:49.229
-a long time ago.
-Hey!

19:49.313 --> 19:50.814
Come on, Hank. Let go.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.816
Mr. Strickland isn't gonna like this.

19:55.110 --> 19:57.112
Oh, gonna brush your teeth
before you kiss me?

19:57.196 --> 19:58.530
Well, still not interested.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.949
No, Rich, you've got a potty mouth,

20:01.033 --> 20:02.993
and I'm gonna wash it out with soap.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.578
What? No!

20:04.661 --> 20:06.455
Come on, guys. Give me a hand.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.666
Hank, let him go!

20:09.750 --> 20:11.543
What has gotten into you?

20:11.627 --> 20:13.921
Buck, he attacked me!

20:14.546 --> 20:16.089
Sir, it's true,

20:16.173 --> 20:18.717
but I just couldn't take
this garbage anymore.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.887
Either it doesn't belong
in the workplace, or I don't.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.264
You heard him, Buck. Fire him.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.518
You all feel the same as Hank?

20:31.271 --> 20:33.607
Even about the fart machine?

20:35.359 --> 20:37.945
Well, hell, I never thought
it was funny, neither.

20:38.028 --> 20:39.196
Terrible stuff.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.615
Uh-uh. Vulgar is what it was.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.075
-But Buck...
-Watch it, Rich,

20:43.158 --> 20:45.452
or I'll turn Hank loose
with a toilet scrubber.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.170
Okay, team, gather round.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.422
I'm going to tell you
about the new improvements

20:57.506 --> 20:59.967
on the Vogner 2800 series.

21:00.050 --> 21:02.803
The first thing is that
it will smoke your meat.

21:02.886 --> 21:06.056
And it's got a nice big rack
for your buns.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.432
Or wieners.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.059
Or wieners. Why not?

21:09.142 --> 21:10.602
Feels good to say wieners again.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.520
Or sausage.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.892
-<i>That's what she said...
about Joe Jack!</i>

21:50.976 --> 21:51.810
