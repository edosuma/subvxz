my team's job is
to get in the building,

00:27.033 --> 00:28.800
and remove anything of value.

Oh my God, that's gorgeous!

until we get these items

00:39.367 --> 00:41.533

and find a buyer.

it may be $500, $600.

these anywhere.

figured he wants to come

We need some muscle.

for some cool stuff.

02:07.467 --> 02:08.934
- And lift stuff?
- Yeah.

08:56.367 --> 08:59.000
Three of these,
they're all the same.

08:59.133 --> 09:00.700
These signs are 1930s,

09:00.834 --> 09:03.600
they're worth $1,000 bucks
apiece, all day long.

09:03.734 --> 09:07.500
Vintage curling scoreboard,
highly collectable.

09:07.633 --> 09:09.767
We are off to a great start
in Timmins,

09:09.900 --> 09:11.533
I am pumped about this.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.367
This is cool, man!

09:14.400 --> 09:16.700
Narrator: Most major sporting
venues began phasing out

09:16.834 --> 09:18.834
hand painted signs
in the late 30s,

09:18.967 --> 09:21.934
when electronic scoreboards
became the norm.

09:22.066 --> 09:23.600
As they fell out of favour,

09:23.734 --> 09:25.767
these scoreboards
became increasingly rare,

09:25.900 --> 09:27.834
and their collectability
increased,

09:27.967 --> 09:30.767
as sports fans looked to own
a piece of history.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.834
- Justin!
- Yo!

09:32.967 --> 09:34.500
- You've gotta see
what I found, man.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.400
Look at this. Ted's happy.

09:36.533 --> 09:37.934
These are the early
scoreboards.

09:38.066 --> 09:39.500
- Wow!
- They're perfect, too.

09:39.633 --> 09:41.266
It's so cool, man!

09:41.400 --> 09:43.066
- This stuff just kind of looks
like junk to me.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.600
- Whoa!
- Junk?

09:44.734 --> 09:47.233
This is not junk, alright?
This is good salvage, man.

09:47.367 --> 09:50.033
There's a lot of money up here.
And a lot of history.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.500
Like, if everything is junk,
you can go back down to Toronto

09:52.633 --> 09:54.500
and start pulling crap
out of there.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.500
- No, I wanna salvage,
I was just saying it's--

09:56.633 --> 09:58.500
- Like, I am pumped here.
We don't call it junk.

09:58.633 --> 10:00.500
- I don't know anything
about salvage.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.367
I didn't mean to say junk.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.266
I just don't know what the
value of these things are.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.033
Ted: There's potential
in everything, alright?

10:06.166 --> 10:08.066
So you guys figure out how
to get these signs out of here,

10:08.200 --> 10:10.166
I'm gonna keep going, man,
this place goes on and on.

10:10.300 --> 10:13.166
- It goes way back there, eh?
- Not junk, alright?

10:16.900 --> 10:18.633
- Cap.

10:18.767 --> 10:20.734
(Objects thud)

10:20.867 --> 10:22.600
Ted: Box of letters.

10:25.633 --> 10:28.266
What's this? Warrant.
Police.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.033
They're like old police
reports!

10:30.166 --> 10:33.266
Domestic problems, weapons,
stolen cars.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.166
Oh, I love this.
"Highgrade?"

10:36.300 --> 10:38.300
See all these old search
warrants and stuff,

10:38.433 --> 10:40.633
this is all like, 1941.

10:40.767 --> 10:42.266
This is very cool.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.266
I'm hunting around,
looking for more old signs.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.700
I literally am tripping
over these boxes.

10:46.834 --> 10:49.233
When I pop one open,
it's full of police reports.

10:49.367 --> 10:52.233
From the 30s and 40s,
they are very cool.

10:52.367 --> 10:54.700
I've never found anything
like this, it is very rare.

10:54.834 --> 10:57.100
Usually these are under
lock and key, or shredded.

10:57.233 --> 10:58.500
- What is that?

10:58.633 --> 11:00.700
- They're like old police
reports from the 40s.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.967
There was boxes of 'em
over there.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.166
A lot of stuff's
at the Central Tavern.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.200
We're heading there next,
what's the odds of that?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.567
- Really?
- Look at this.

11:08.700 --> 11:11.567
November 8th, 1941, 12:15 pm.

11:11.700 --> 11:14.000
Received a call
to the Central Tavern.

11:14.133 --> 11:17.200
This guy caused a disturbance,
and he was drunk.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.166
And wanted some highgrade.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.900
The boy reached across
the table and hit

11:21.033 --> 11:23.100
the bartender with a pole.
Well, that's it.

11:23.233 --> 11:25.166
This is why I love salvaging,

11:25.300 --> 11:26.967
I never know what
I'm gonna find.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.000
A snapshot into history.

11:29.133 --> 11:32.700
Selling stolen gold, highgrade.
But what's highgrade?

11:32.834 --> 11:34.767
- I've never heard of it.
- Like, high grade gold?

11:34.900 --> 11:36.567
- I don't know, man.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.233
- Today was a great day.

11:38.367 --> 11:40.233
We found some excellent
mechanical pieces,

11:40.367 --> 11:42.700

11:42.834 --> 11:45.867
Upstairs, hand painted signs,
and then... these,

the door is locked,

it's because something
is in there,

you're doing some

15:36.066 --> 15:37.700

15:37.834 --> 15:40.300
Back in the 20s, and the 30s,
and 40s in Timmins,

15:40.433 --> 15:42.600
there were literally dozens
of these rooming houses

15:42.734 --> 15:45.433
that doubled as hotels, where
the guys would go and drink.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.033
Thousands of miners go
through there.

15:47.166 --> 15:48.867
- Right.
- So they'd come off shift,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.734
and if they had some gold,
what they would do,

15:50.867 --> 15:53.533
is they'd go up to their room,

15:53.667 --> 15:55.867
and stash a little bit
of it away.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.300
Narrator: As prospectors rushed
north to the Timmins area

15:58.433 --> 16:00.767
looking for gold,
the local mines boomed,

16:00.900 --> 16:03.667
and so did the number of
taverns, hotels and brothels.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.500
From the very beginning,
stolen gold flowed as freely

16:06.633 --> 16:08.367
as the beer in the taverns.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.233
Music was also a big part

Country superstar,

both made their debuts at
the famous Maple Leaf Hotel,

16:21.567 --> 16:23.600
- Where am I looking
for this gold?

16:23.734 --> 16:25.900

pull the floorboards out,

16:26.033 --> 16:28.033
you can pull the baseboards out.

in there.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.200

Brandon: You going in?

17:44.233 --> 17:46.900
- So what's the plan here now,
we've got a nice access hole?

17:47.033 --> 17:49.166
- We can wrap a strap
around the back.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.734
And even if the door drops
a little,

17:51.867 --> 17:53.533
and then the strap holds it.
- Yeah. Right.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.767
- Then lay it down, it's
probably the safest bet.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.567
- You're gonna walk right in?
- Yeah.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.433
Narrator: Justin now
has to manoeuvre

18:00.567 --> 18:02.834
his 30 ton machine
into the building.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.033
Justin: Ooh, it's a tight fit.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.066
Uh, I'm in!

18:09.200 --> 18:11.066
Narrator: The plan is to strap
the unbolted doors

18:11.200 --> 18:13.233
to the bucket,
and use the machine

18:13.367 --> 18:15.967
to safely lower them
to the ground.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.467
- Come down a little bit.

very secure like that.

Watch out, Brandon,
it could go that way!

18:30.867 --> 18:32.400
(Whirring, creaking)

18:33.433 --> 18:35.834
Ted: There you go, keep going.

18:37.100 --> 18:38.166
That's perfect!

18:38.300 --> 18:40.367
- Watch, it might fall still.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.400
- You got it.

18:42.533 --> 18:44.166
Perfect! Perfect.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.633
We got 'em out, can't wait
to get 'em back to the yard.

18:46.767 --> 18:48.734
Gotta do a little work on 'em,
but we'll fix them up,

18:48.867 --> 18:50.066
it's all good.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.500
- We didn't break 'em too much.

18:51.633 --> 18:54.433
- I've gotta cut the bottom off
anyhow, it's rotted.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.400
Narrator: With the big doors
saved,

18:56.533 --> 18:58.033

behind us, now it's off

19:21.700 --> 19:23.867

in South Porcupine.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.867
It's been closed
for a number of years.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.333
I have no idea what
the condition is.

19:28.467 --> 19:30.567
It's bigger than I thought, eh?
- Bigger than I thought, too.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.834
- Two doors: Men,
and women entrance.

19:33.967 --> 19:36.433
That's the way it was back
in the 20s.

19:36.567 --> 19:38.467
Narrator: The Central Tavern,
known to the locals

19:38.600 --> 19:41.867
as "The Zoo," was a rowdy,
rough-and-tumble watering hole

19:42.000 --> 19:43.433
from the very beginning.

19:43.567 --> 19:45.700
Frequented by young miners
after their shifts,

19:45.834 --> 19:48.233
it became a known spot
for drunkenness,

19:48.367 --> 19:50.900
and disorderly conduct.

19:51.033 --> 19:53.000
Ted: Pop the door.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.900
- Watch the nails.

19:56.433 --> 19:58.867
- Oh-ho-ho!
Look at this place.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.967
- Got a good stink in here!

20:02.367 --> 20:04.567
There's a lot of dead
animals here.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.233
Justin: There's a dead animal,
right there.

20:06.367 --> 20:08.200
Ted: That is super cool.
That's a nice one, eh?

20:08.333 --> 20:10.000
Justin: That is huge.

20:10.133 --> 20:11.667
Ted: That's a 20 point moose,
that's big.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.233
It's very cool
but we can't sell it.

20:13.367 --> 20:15.367
- Why can't you sell it?
- You can hand them down,

20:15.500 --> 20:17.633
you can gift them, but it's
against the law to sell these.

20:17.767 --> 20:20.100
I think I should put it
in the shop. Nice old map.

20:22.934 --> 20:24.367

and the moose head.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.967
Justin: Yeah.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.533
Ted: And I'm gonna take
a quick scout around, alright?

20:29.667 --> 20:31.233
And then we'll come back,
start salvaging,

20:31.367 --> 20:33.000
and looking for gold.

20:33.133 --> 20:35.467
If you turn around and my
truck's gone, I found gold.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.800
- Don't go running off.
- I won't.

20:38.834 --> 20:40.367

this moose down.

20:44.367 --> 20:46.100
- Just take the weight off
a little.

This moose has been here
for years.

36:08.533 --> 36:09.800
Narrator: These lights
are great pieces

36:09.934 --> 36:12.300
of industrial salvage,
pulled from Stelco,

36:12.433 --> 36:14.200
for decades,
one of North America's

36:14.333 --> 36:15.533
most important steel mills.

36:15.667 --> 36:17.533
- What are we looking
at for cost?

36:17.667 --> 36:20.800
- For these, each, they're
at least $350, $400, as is.

36:20.934 --> 36:22.800
- And what if we cleaned them
up before selling them?

36:22.934 --> 36:24.433
- We could clean them up
for you

36:24.567 --> 36:26.667
and have them all wired up,
no problem.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.533
But you're looking at $800
bucks a piece.

36:28.667 --> 36:30.633
- $800 per?
- Yeah.
- Whoo.

36:30.767 --> 36:32.200
Let me take a closer look.

36:32.333 --> 36:34.433
- Yeah, take a look,
have a feel. They're great.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.133
- Ohh. Okay.
- This is a statement piece

36:36.266 --> 36:38.667
for your new home, if you want
something slightly industrial.

36:38.800 --> 36:41.400
One of a kind.
- I do love them.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.000
I do want them, just $800
seems a little steep.

36:44.133 --> 36:45.767
It's a lot of money
for some lights.

36:45.900 --> 36:49.166
- Is it, though? Is it though?
- For a set of lights,

36:49.300 --> 36:51.533
I think $1,300 is my highest
number here.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.500
- I think I,
I think we can do that.

36:53.633 --> 36:55.533
- You can do it?
- We have a deal. Awesome.

36:55.667 --> 36:57.867
- Thank you.
- It's gonna look amazing

36:58.000 --> 36:59.800
in your house.
- Yeah. I can't wait.

36:59.934 --> 37:01.800
- Great. Awesome. Well, let's
go write this up then.

37:01.934 --> 37:03.567
Ian: Perfect.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.166
Narrator: Ted's time in Timmins
is almost over

37:07.300 --> 37:09.734
and he's gotten lost inside
a hunt for gold.

37:09.867 --> 37:12.367
The old police reports
revealed stories

37:12.500 --> 37:15.266
of stolen gold being hidden
and sold in local taverns,

37:15.400 --> 37:17.166
including mentions
of the Central,

37:17.300 --> 37:18.900
where Ted turned up empty,

37:19.033 --> 37:20.867
and the historic
Grandview Hotel,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.834
his final salvage destination
in Timmins.

37:23.967 --> 37:26.333
Ted: I was talking to these
boys later,

37:26.467 --> 37:29.667
and they said they just came
into the beverage room

37:29.800 --> 37:33.834
and sat down and matched to see
what would pay for the beer.

37:35.200 --> 37:38.667
There's a lot of characters
around here and guns.

37:38.800 --> 37:42.467
Gun. Domestic problems,
weapons. Stolen gold.

37:43.633 --> 37:46.133
High grading. It's quite
the list of rounders here.

37:46.266 --> 37:48.333
All around the Grandview though.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.266
There's got to be high
grading there,

37:50.400 --> 37:52.166
these guys are all involved
in it.

37:52.300 --> 37:54.166
Pretty wild stuff, man.

37:56.633 --> 37:58.200
(Phone rings)

37:58.333 --> 38:00.333
Ted: Hey Ryan, how's it going?
Ryan: How's it going today?

38:00.467 --> 38:02.967
Ted: Pretty good so far.
We've got some really

38:03.100 --> 38:04.734
cool stuff out of this Tisdale
place.

38:04.867 --> 38:06.433
Ryan: You're still up there?

38:06.567 --> 38:08.900
Ted: We found some really cool
signage and historical stuff.

38:09.033 --> 38:11.767
- Please tell me you got more
than just a couple old signs.

38:11.900 --> 38:13.867
I really could use you back
at the yard.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.133
Ted: My boss is not interested
in excuses.

38:16.266 --> 38:19.000
I have to find some great
salvage at the Grandview.

38:19.133 --> 38:20.900
My ass is on the line.

38:21.033 --> 38:22.767
Give us another day,
we'll head back home.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.367
- Thanks, Ted.
- Okay, bye.

38:28.467 --> 38:30.100
Here we go, the Grandview.

38:30.233 --> 38:31.967
- Smell that highgrade.
- Yeah.

38:32.100 --> 38:33.533
- Look at that sign.

38:33.667 --> 38:34.934
- It's a lot nicer
than the Central.

38:35.066 --> 38:37.033
- Do you think there's gonna be
better stuff in this one?

38:37.166 --> 38:39.133
- I have no idea what's here.
- How do we get in here?

38:39.266 --> 38:41.000
Ted: The access in the back,
we'll just pull in the alley,

38:41.133 --> 38:42.800
park right behind it and
we go from there, alright?

38:42.934 --> 38:44.433
- Sweet. Let's do it.
- Let's go.

38:44.567 --> 38:45.734
Ted: I'm into this place, man.

38:45.867 --> 38:48.467
The Grandview Hotel
was the drinking spot

38:48.600 --> 38:50.533
in Schumacher for decades.

38:50.667 --> 38:52.400
There was a major fire here,

38:52.533 --> 38:55.333
it's got to come down but
I'm getting in there first.

38:56.934 --> 38:59.467
Ugh, you can still smell
the smoke heavily.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.233
This is bad.

39:05.967 --> 39:09.133
This is a nice box.
Nice old carpenter's box.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.266
Fire jobs are always
a little scary.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.834
Just all the destruction.

39:19.166 --> 39:21.000
Pretty sketchy though.

39:21.133 --> 39:24.066
Wow. The heat must have been
unbelievable.

39:25.333 --> 39:27.834
This place is coming down
by itself.

39:27.967 --> 39:30.500
Nothing left up here.
It is fried.

I find bars all the time

39:54.633 --> 39:58.734
- Wow. That is so cool, man.
- This is a killer piece.

I find bars all the time,

40:18.767 --> 40:20.834
Art deco, custom made,

40:20.967 --> 40:23.467
1930's, timeless.

this one's worth, Ted?

40:25.300 --> 40:27.033
Ted: If you had to buy
something like this new

40:27.166 --> 40:28.934
and get it made, you'd be
a hundred thousand bucks.

40:29.066 --> 40:31.467
I'm gonna aim for $12,000,
if we get this out of here.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.433
We have to get this out
of here, okay?

40:33.567 --> 40:35.133
- Ted, I don't know
if you noticed,

40:35.266 --> 40:37.266
but this is a large bar
and that's a small door.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.166
- It was built on site, but
it will come apart in pieces.

40:40.300 --> 40:41.967
They didn't bring it in
like this.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.967
- Well, there's a big L
there and, um,

40:44.100 --> 40:45.734
that's not going to fit.

40:45.867 --> 40:47.400
- This bar can pay

40:47.533 --> 40:49.066
It's getting out of here,

40:49.200 --> 40:51.033
Brandon, you come with me.
- And I'll go grab the tools.

40:51.166 --> 40:53.633
Ted: While Justin takes
that bar apart,

40:53.767 --> 40:55.700
Brandon and I are looking
for gold.

40:56.734 --> 40:58.600
I tell you, that stink
hasn't gotten any better.

40:58.734 --> 41:00.734
- Yeah, it's terrible, ugh.

41:03.233 --> 41:05.166
We're not going to spend
all day down here, are we?

41:05.300 --> 41:06.900
Ted: Well, we're going
to look a little bit.

41:07.033 --> 41:08.767
- I'm not going to wander off
too far,

41:08.900 --> 41:10.033
you're the only one
that's got a light.

41:10.166 --> 41:12.233
- Alright, stick with me.
- What are those?

41:12.367 --> 41:14.100
- They're big rocks.
- They're just giant rocks?

41:14.233 --> 41:15.900
- Why are they here though?

41:16.033 --> 41:18.000
There's big rocks down
in the basement.

41:24.367 --> 41:26.900
Part of an old lock set, see?
- Are you going to keep that?

41:27.033 --> 41:29.667
- No, I'm not going to keep
that. It's all hammered.

41:31.033 --> 41:33.867
This place is very confusing.

41:35.567 --> 41:37.300
- Oh, what is that?

41:37.433 --> 41:39.333
- Oh, it's a fancy pool cue.

41:41.133 --> 41:43.233
- Imagine this was hollow
and gold came out? (Taps)

41:43.367 --> 41:46.200
- A lot of weird
stuff down here.

41:46.333 --> 41:48.033
- Oh, what about that,
right there?

41:48.166 --> 41:50.100
What is it?
Oh, it's a miner's helmet.

41:50.233 --> 41:52.433
- Oh, it's a miner's helmet?
- Yeah. Look at that.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.567
there's gold in these places.

41:59.700 --> 42:01.533
We haven't found a thing yet.

42:01.667 --> 42:04.633
We've looked in floors,
walls, basements.

42:04.767 --> 42:07.200
Everywhere except the ceiling.

42:07.333 --> 42:09.200
I want to check the ceiling
tiles a little bit.

42:09.333 --> 42:12.200
- The ceiling tiles?
- Yeah, because it's a public
spot,

42:12.333 --> 42:14.300
they could hide it up there.
I just want to take a look.

42:14.433 --> 42:15.967
Brandon: What, are we gonna
poke every one

42:16.100 --> 42:18.100

Ted: Well, just pop a few here

42:18.233 --> 42:20.200
