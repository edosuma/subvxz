11:45.487 --> 11:47.184
PROBABLY AN ALIAS,

11:47.228 --> 11:49.839
BUT HE KILLED
ALIA NAZARI
AND REGGIE HARRIS,

11:49.883 --> 11:52.494
AND HE TRIED TO KILL
ME AND MY BOSS,

11:52.537 --> 11:55.149
ALL TO KEEP SOME COVER-UP
INSIDE THE CROWS
FROM GETTING OUT.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.151
WHICH MEANS WE'VE OGT
A JUICY SCANDAL
ON OUR HANDS.

11:57.194 --> 12:00.197
ASSUMING WE CAN FIGURE
OUT WHO HE'S WORKING FOR.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.722
THIS ONE'S YOURS.
EXTRA PICKLES.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.552
UM, WELL, I'LL LOOK
INTO HIS FINANCES,

12:07.596 --> 12:09.380
SEE IF ANYONE'S PAYING
HIM KILL 4 PEOPLE
IN 1 DAY MONEY.

12:09.424 --> 12:10.991
I ALREADY DID.

12:11.034 --> 12:13.558
A WIRE WAS SENT
TO HIS ACCOUNT
FOR 180 GRAND

12:13.602 --> 12:15.256
THE DAY REGGIE HARRIS
WAS EXONERATED

12:15.299 --> 12:16.736
FOR LUCIUS FOX'S
MURDER.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.215
NICELY DONE.

12:18.259 --> 12:19.521
I'LL GO PESTER
THE BANK MANAGER THEN,

12:19.564 --> 12:21.001
FIGURE OUT
WHO SENT IT.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.872
-WHICH BANK?
-GOTHAM INTERNATIONAL.

12:22.916 --> 12:25.048
-YOU'RE KIDDING.
-WHAT?

12:25.092 --> 12:27.485
GOTHAM INTERNATIONAL
BANK IS A PILE
OF RUBBLE

12:27.529 --> 12:30.445
ALONG WITH ITS VAULT,
ITS SERVERS,
BACKUP SERVERS.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.577
YEAH. SOME BLOKE
CLEVERLY NAMED
THE DETONATOR

12:32.621 --> 12:34.754
BOMBED IT LAST NIGHT.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.712
DO YOU THINK HE COULD
BE INVOLVED IN THIS
CROWS COVER-UP?

12:36.756 --> 12:39.280
NO. I REMEMBER
THE DETONATOR.

12:39.323 --> 12:42.370
HE WAS ACTIVE LONG
BEFORE REGGIE WAS CONVICTED.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.502
ALL RIGHT.
MOVE OVER.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.678
IF WE CAN'T TRACE
OUR SNIPER'S PAYCHECKS,

12:46.722 --> 12:48.768
MAYBE WE CAN FIGURE OUT
HIS REAL NAME.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.771
[TYPING]

13:01.171 --> 13:02.869
KATE: THAT'S NEW.

13:06.220 --> 13:09.658
-WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?
-NOT ESPECIALLY.

13:09.701 --> 13:12.226
LUKE, THE MAN YOU THINK
KILLED YOUR FATHER,

13:12.269 --> 13:14.228
HE WAS CLEARED
AND THEN SHOT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.012
KIND OF THINK TALKING
WOULD BE GOOD.

13:16.056 --> 13:17.884
THEN LET'S TALK.
WHY HAVEN'T YOU FOUND

13:17.927 --> 13:20.451
ANYTHING ON
CARTWRIGHT YET?

13:20.495 --> 13:24.847
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE HE'S GONE
UNDERGROUND.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.283
WELL, WHILE YOU'VE
BEEN AWAY,

13:26.327 --> 13:27.850
IGNORING ALL
MY TEXTS,

13:27.894 --> 13:31.245
THE BAT-LIGHT'S GONE
UNANSWERED.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.247
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M HERE?

13:33.290 --> 13:35.075
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THE DETONATOR?

13:35.118 --> 13:37.468
JACOB: 7 YEARS AGO,
THE DETONATOR CRIPPLED GOTHAM

13:37.512 --> 13:39.862
WITH FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.995
HE'S A TERRORIST,
WHO TARGETS THE CITY'S GOOD GUYS

13:42.038 --> 13:44.693
AND COMPELS THEM
TO KILL INNOCENTS AT RANDOM.

13:44.736 --> 13:47.478
THE QUESTION IS
WHY IS HE BACK NOW?

13:47.522 --> 13:49.698
LUKE: YOU WANT
AN HONEST ANSWER
TO THAT?

13:49.741 --> 13:52.353
YOU, BATWOMAN.

13:52.396 --> 13:55.356
WHEN THE BAT'S AWAY,
THE CRAZIES WILL PLAY.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.140
I'VE ONLY BEEN OUT
A WEEK.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.142
AND IN THAT WEEK,
THE BAD GUYS ARE
GETTING COMFORTABLE.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.362
JACOB: THE DETONATOR TARGETS
PEOPLE THE PUBLIC VIEWS

14:01.405 --> 14:04.887
AS HEROES--DOCTORS,
POLICE OFFICERS, FIREMEN.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.498
HE WANTS TO PROVE
THAT THEY'RE NOT AS HEROIC

14:07.542 --> 14:09.457
AS THE WORLD THINKS
THEY WERE.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.588
KATE: WHERE'D YOU
GET THESE?

14:10.632 --> 14:12.852
BRUCE'S RESEARCH.

14:12.895 --> 14:15.028
YEAH. HE WAS OBSESSED
WITH CATCHING THIS GUY.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.856
KEPT A LONG LIST
OF SUSPECTS,

14:16.899 --> 14:18.945
BUT THE TRAIL WENT
COLD BEFORE HE COULD
NARROW IT DOWN.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.772
JACOB: 214. THE BOMB
THAT TOOK OUT

14:20.816 --> 14:22.644
GOTHAM INTERNATIONAL BANK

14:22.687 --> 14:24.776
HAD THESE 3 NUMBERS
STAMPED INTO THE GROUND PLATE.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.562
THIS SIGNATURE MATCHES
ALL 15 BOMBS

14:27.605 --> 14:29.520
DETONATED 7 YEARS AGO.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.566
TO BE CLEAR,
THIS INFORMATION
WAS NEVER RELEASED

14:31.609 --> 14:33.220
TO THE PUBLIC,

14:33.263 --> 14:35.439
WHICH ELIMINATES
THE POSSIBILITY
OF A COPYCAT.

14:35.483 --> 14:37.441
-THIS IS AN ORIGINAL.
-THAT IS OUR ASSERTION,

14:37.485 --> 14:41.576
ALTHOUGH WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT 214 ACTUALLY MEANS.

14:41.619 --> 14:45.536
KATE: ANYONE ON THAT
SUSPECT WITH MILITARY
EXPERIENCE?

14:45.580 --> 14:47.930
UH, YEAH.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.411
YEAH. A COUPLE.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.108
WHO'S GEORGE ADLER?

14:52.152 --> 14:54.067
PRIVATE BLACK OPS
CONTRACTOR.

14:54.110 --> 14:56.547
HE WAS FIRED
FOR...

14:56.591 --> 14:59.724
YEAH. THAT'LL DO IT.

14:59.768 --> 15:02.814
HE WAS CAUGHT TAKING
SELFIES WITH ENEMY CORPSES?

15:02.858 --> 15:05.817
ADLER WAS DISHONORABLY
DISCHARGED

15:05.861 --> 15:07.384
FROM MILITARY SCHOOL
BACK IN THE DAY.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.038
NO SURPRISE THERE,

15:09.082 --> 15:10.910
BUT CLEARLY THAT
WASN'T ENOUGH
TO IMPLICATE HIM

15:10.953 --> 15:12.389
IN BRUCE'S MIND.

15:12.433 --> 15:13.825
BRUCE DIDN'T GO
TO MILITARY SCHOOL.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.436
HE WOULDN'T KNOW
THE SPECIFIC FORM NUMBER

15:15.479 --> 15:19.701
ON DISCHARGE PAPERS--
DD-214.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.747
I ONLY KNOW BECAUSE
POINT ROCK PUT

15:22.791 --> 15:24.793
THE SAME CODE
ON MY PAPERS.

15:24.836 --> 15:27.100
SO THE MILITARY DEEMS
YOU NOT GOOD ENOUGH,

15:27.143 --> 15:29.363
AND NOW THAT VERY THING
IS GONNA SAVE
YOUR CITY'S ASS.

15:29.406 --> 15:33.497
I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE
THAT LITTLE PIECE
OF IRONY RIGHT THERE.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.151
I'LL GO TALK TO ADLER.

15:35.195 --> 15:36.979
WELCOME BACK, BATWOMAN.

15:41.201 --> 15:43.029
OF 10 POUNDS
PER SQUARE INCH.

15:43.072 --> 15:45.640
GOTHAM CAN BE GLAD
THEIR HERO'S BOMB-PROOF.

15:45.683 --> 15:48.512
NOW THAT KIND OF BLAST
WILL KNOCK OFF LIMBS
AND TOPPLE BUILDINGS...

15:48.556 --> 15:50.514

OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS--

YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT
LOOKING FOR CARTWRIGHT,
HAVE YOU?

16:07.227 --> 16:09.969
OK. UH, LOOK.
THE BAT TEAM DOESN'T
HAVE AN HR DEPARTMENT,

16:10.012 --> 16:12.797
