<i>My name is Nathan Fielder,</i>

00:02.099 --> 00:05.185
<i>and I graduated from one
of Canada's top business schools</i>

00:05.234 --> 00:06.686
<i>with really good grades.</i>

00:07.719 --> 00:09.386
<i>Now I'm using my knowledge</i>

00:09.421 --> 00:11.882
<i>to help struggling
small business owners make it</i>

00:11.917 --> 00:13.390
<i>in this competitive world.</i>

00:21.933 --> 00:24.393
This is <i> Nathan for You.</i>

00:24.433 --> 00:27.938
<i>Women make up
some of the prettiest humans</i>

00:27.940 --> 00:28.813
<i>in the world,</i>

00:28.931 --> 00:31.692
<i>and for online dating websites
like Dating DNA</i>

00:31.725 --> 00:34.644
<i>those long-haired angels
are a prize to be won.</i>

00:34.646 --> 00:36.312
<i>CEO Kevin Carmony admits</i>

00:36.363 --> 00:38.481
<i>that attracting more female
users to his site</i>

00:38.532 --> 00:39.982
<i>is the key to growth.</i>

00:40.033 --> 00:44.453
'cause right now we're
probably 65% men, 35% women.

00:44.488 --> 00:46.706
<i>But to do this you need
a thorough understanding</i>

00:46.740 --> 00:48.825
<i>of how the female brain works.</i>

00:49.247 --> 00:51.463
<i>So I paid Kevin a visit
at his penthouse suite</i>

00:51.498 --> 00:54.416
<i>in Irvine, California,
to share my expertise.</i>

00:54.467 --> 00:58.304
The main reason most women
are afraid to use online dating

00:58.338 --> 01:01.340
is because they think
the person they meet up with

01:01.391 --> 01:05.260
could potentially be a killer
and murder them.

01:05.312 --> 01:07.930
Um, I don't know
that that's a big reason

01:07.981 --> 01:09.932
that women don't sign up
for dating sites.

01:09.934 --> 01:12.268
We haven't had women
contacting us,

01:12.270 --> 01:14.236
"Hey, I met this guy on your
site and he was a creep

01:14.271 --> 01:15.437
and this and that happened."

01:15.439 --> 01:16.772
- We have enough--
- Well, you might not hear

01:16.823 --> 01:19.441
from those women because...

01:19.443 --> 01:22.578
I don't think that is
the-- It's certainly a concern.

01:22.612 --> 01:25.522
The solution
is Daddy's watching.

01:26.450 --> 01:27.916
Okay.

01:27.951 --> 01:31.287
<i>Up until age 18, most women
have a daddy keeping tabs</i>

01:31.289 --> 01:33.172
<i>on any man she goes out with.</i>

01:33.206 --> 01:36.091
<i>But once she gets bigger,
Daddy's no longer around,</i>

01:36.126 --> 01:37.760
<i>but danger still is.</i>

01:37.794 --> 01:40.095
<i>So if Dating DNA offered
a security service</i>

01:40.130 --> 01:42.514
<i>where female users could request
to have someone</i>

01:42.549 --> 01:45.217
<i>secretly watch over
their first dates,</i>

01:45.268 --> 01:47.386
<i>the website would quickly become
the obvious choice</i>

01:47.437 --> 01:49.638
<i>for women
looking to date online</i>

01:49.640 --> 01:52.691
<i>because they know
that Daddy's watching.</i>

01:52.726 --> 01:53.859
Eh...

01:53.893 --> 01:56.312
Seems a little condescending
to me to women

01:56.363 --> 01:58.530
that Daddy has to take care
of you and Daddy's watching--

02:00.617 --> 02:01.700
I-I don't know--

02:01.735 --> 02:04.153
Now before you say anything,
you know,

02:04.155 --> 02:07.289
it might not be good on camera
to say anything bad

02:07.324 --> 02:09.991
about an idea
that makes women safer.

02:10.043 --> 02:11.543
- Yes, but--
- You don't wanna look like

02:11.578 --> 02:15.631
you're not trying
to make women feel safe.

02:15.665 --> 02:17.333
Yeah.
And so that's something

02:17.384 --> 02:20.054
that might-- may make a woman
feel more secure, certainly.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.670
<i>Kevin loved my idea.</i>

02:21.672 --> 02:23.555
<i>But before he could offer it
to his users,</i>

02:23.590 --> 02:25.841
<i>I needed to develop
official guidelines</i>

02:25.843 --> 02:28.344
<i>for how the Daddy's watching
system would work.</i>

02:28.395 --> 02:30.979
<i>So I found a Dating DNA user,
Kamarin,</i>

02:31.014 --> 02:32.598
<i>who agreed to let me
try out the service</i>

02:32.649 --> 02:34.483
<i>on one of her first dates.</i>

02:34.517 --> 02:36.018
So your date
will be arriving soon,

02:36.069 --> 02:38.604
and because we're trying
this out for today,

02:38.655 --> 02:39.855
I'll be your daddy.

02:39.906 --> 02:40.939
Okay.

02:40.990 --> 02:42.358
And we also
have some branding

02:42.409 --> 02:44.576
kinda elements we're trying
to incorporate.

02:44.611 --> 02:46.862
So if you're ever in fear
at any time

02:46.864 --> 02:49.248
during your date, just yell out,

02:49.282 --> 02:51.917
"Daddy, Daddy, come over now.

02:51.951 --> 02:55.621
"Save my life.
You made a vow."

02:55.672 --> 02:56.872
Sounds good?

02:56.923 --> 02:59.375
So do you want
to practice that or--

02:59.426 --> 03:01.126
What would happen
if I just yelled, "Help"?

03:01.177 --> 03:03.178
Like, what's the significance
in me--

03:03.213 --> 03:05.714
Well, if I just hear, "Help,"
you know, that could be anyone.

03:05.765 --> 03:08.884
But the Daddy rhyme,
I know it's you.

03:08.886 --> 03:10.052
Cool.

03:10.054 --> 03:11.470
- All right.
- All right.

03:11.521 --> 03:12.554
Thank you, Nate.

03:12.556 --> 03:13.722
- Nathan.
- Nathan.

03:13.724 --> 03:14.973
- Yeah, you can call me Nate.
- All right.

03:15.024 --> 03:16.358
All right.

03:16.393 --> 03:17.559
- Whatever.
- Thank you.

03:17.610 --> 03:19.061
- Either way...
- All right.

03:19.112 --> 03:20.779
It's casual.

03:20.814 --> 03:23.198
<i>With Kamarin prepped,
I got into position</i>

03:23.233 --> 03:24.700
<i>out front of her building.</i>

03:24.734 --> 03:26.368
<i>And knowing
what her date looked like,</i>

03:26.403 --> 03:29.488
<i>I had a method to covertly
vet him before he picked her up.</i>

03:29.539 --> 03:31.039
Hey, man, could you do me
a favor?

03:31.074 --> 03:32.408
I'm just moving
out of my building.

03:32.459 --> 03:33.409
Would you be able
to take a photo of me

03:33.460 --> 03:34.993
in front of my building?

03:35.044 --> 03:36.378
Um, yeah.

03:36.413 --> 03:37.746
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

03:37.797 --> 03:39.798
Oh, I guess
I packed my camera.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.383
I thought I had it on me.

03:41.418 --> 03:45.254
Do you happen to have like
a knife, or any weapon,

03:45.256 --> 03:46.555
anything sharp
I could open the box with...

03:46.589 --> 03:47.973
- I can do it with a key.
- Gun or--

03:48.007 --> 03:49.892
Oh, key?
Okay.

03:49.926 --> 03:51.260
Where you headed?

03:52.645 --> 03:54.430
Oh, really?

03:54.432 --> 03:55.681
Cool, thanks.

03:55.732 --> 03:56.982
Yeah, women, huh?

03:57.016 --> 03:58.100
Sometimes you wanna kiss 'em,
other times

03:58.151 --> 03:59.435
you just wanna
wring their necks,

03:59.486 --> 04:00.652
you know what I mean?

04:00.687 --> 04:03.906
You feel that way?

04:03.940 --> 04:05.407
Like sometimes
you wanna kiss 'em,

04:05.442 --> 04:09.111
other times you wanna
wring their necks.

04:09.113 --> 04:10.112
You wouldn't?

04:10.114 --> 04:11.413
But sometimes, you know,

04:11.448 --> 04:14.950
when a girl says no
she really means yes, right?

04:15.001 --> 04:16.618
Yeah?

04:18.620 --> 04:20.622
You're not a sex offender
or anything?

04:20.624 --> 04:21.712
Okay.

04:21.733 --> 04:22.762
All right, yeah.
Have a good day.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.376
<i>Cody seemed okay at first</i>

04:24.427 --> 04:25.627
<i>but just to be safe,</i>

04:25.678 --> 04:28.130
<i>I preserved his fingerprints
from the camera</i>

04:28.132 --> 04:29.631
<i>so I could give them
to the authorities</i>

04:29.682 --> 04:32.301
<i>in case things took a turn
for the worse.</i>

04:32.352 --> 04:34.803
<i>Moments later, they left for
their date at the bowling alley,</i>

04:34.805 --> 04:37.105
<i>and I was sure
to follow close behind.</i>

04:37.140 --> 04:38.390
<i>Once they arrived,</i>

04:38.441 --> 04:40.976
<i>they started their game
and got to know each other.</i>

04:41.027 --> 04:42.277
Where are you from?

04:42.312 --> 04:43.779
I'm originally from Anaheim.

04:43.813 --> 04:44.780
I live in Westwood now.

04:44.814 --> 04:46.114
<i>And from a distance,</i>

04:46.149 --> 04:48.700
<i>it looked as though things
were off to a good start.</i>

04:48.735 --> 04:50.536
<i>But in case something
were to happen,</i>

04:50.570 --> 04:53.155
<i>I had a method that allowed me
to be right next to them,</i>

04:53.206 --> 04:56.325
<i>and completely invisible
at the same time.</i>

04:56.327 --> 04:58.827
<i>Disguised as a female bowler
in religious garb,</i>

04:58.878 --> 05:02.130
<i>I was able to be within earshot
of Kamarin and her date.</i>

05:02.165 --> 05:04.166
<i>Ready to split things up
if his strike celebrations</i>

05:04.168 --> 05:06.835
<i>got a little too touchy.</i>

05:06.837 --> 05:09.087
<i>Fortunately,
that wasn't required.</i>

05:09.138 --> 05:11.473
<i>Cody seemed
like a genuinely good guy,</i>

05:11.508 --> 05:12.891
<i>and I could tell Kamarin
felt safe</i>

05:12.926 --> 05:14.745
<i>As she really began to open up.</i>

05:14.782 --> 05:16.349
If two planes
brought down the two towers...

05:16.398 --> 05:17.262
Uh-huh?

05:17.313 --> 05:18.611
I could see
that as being feasible.

05:18.668 --> 05:19.797
Okay.

05:19.867 --> 05:22.450
But what brought down
building number seven?

05:23.409 --> 05:24.641
Building seven.

05:25.069 --> 05:27.070
<i>My method was working
perfectly,</i>

05:27.091 --> 05:29.509
<i>and after Cody
returned her home unharmed,</i>

05:29.599 --> 05:32.184
<i>I went inside to see
if Kamarin felt as good as I did</i>

05:32.218 --> 05:33.435
<i>about the service.</i>

05:33.469 --> 05:36.271
Do you feel like you felt safe

05:36.306 --> 05:38.106
- and everything?
- Yeah. Feel pretty secure.

05:38.141 --> 05:39.775
You didn't know it was me,
right?

05:39.809 --> 05:41.059
No.
Not at all.

05:41.110 --> 05:42.611
Yeah, so...

05:42.645 --> 05:44.813
That shows that I guess
it worked pretty well.

05:44.815 --> 05:46.198
Yeah.

05:46.232 --> 05:48.650
<i>The Daddy's watching system
was a total success.</i>

05:48.652 --> 05:50.869
<i>But for it to work
with Dating DNA</i>

05:50.903 --> 05:53.414
<i>I'd need to build a staff
of trained daddies</i>

05:53.511 --> 05:55.207
<i>who'd be as trustworthy as I am.</i>

05:55.241 --> 05:57.826
<i>So I put up some fliers
that offered security work.</i>

05:57.828 --> 05:59.196
<i>And the next day,</i>

05:59.216 --> 06:02.331
<i>I met with the one guy
who responded to my ad.</i>

06:02.382 --> 06:03.882
What would you do
in this scenario?

06:03.916 --> 06:07.419
You're protecting the woman
and the guy tries to kiss her.

06:07.470 --> 06:09.504
- I'm gonna drop him.
- What does that--

06:09.555 --> 06:10.672
If I do it hard enough,
right here,

06:10.723 --> 06:12.974
and right in the glands
for your windpipe,

06:13.009 --> 06:15.560
I push hard enough to--
like this.

06:15.595 --> 06:17.679
For about thirt--
For about three seconds-- four,

06:17.730 --> 06:19.014
I can put you out.

06:19.016 --> 06:20.482
- Cool.
- Or back here, right here.

06:20.516 --> 06:23.018
Underneath the lobe.

06:23.069 --> 06:24.853
But you have to go like that

06:24.855 --> 06:26.321
back here by the lobe
to get it.

06:26.356 --> 06:27.773
You know, it puts you out
for about 30 seconds.

06:27.824 --> 06:30.692
This one here puts you out
for about a minute.

06:30.694 --> 06:31.860
So you know lots of moves.

06:31.862 --> 06:33.495
I know a couple, yeah.

06:33.529 --> 06:35.530
<i>Mark seemed qualified
for the job,</i>

06:35.581 --> 06:37.666
<i>but I still needed
to see him in action.</i>

06:37.700 --> 06:40.535
<i>So I arranged the service for
another Dating DNA user,</i>

06:40.537 --> 06:42.087
<i>and brought Mark with me
to her home</i>

06:42.121 --> 06:45.207
<i>to see if he could handle
his first real job as a daddy.</i>

06:45.258 --> 06:46.291
How you doing, Polly?

06:46.342 --> 06:47.542
Good, thank you.

06:47.544 --> 06:49.261
- So Mark will be your daddy.
- Okay.

06:49.295 --> 06:51.380
And he will be following you

06:51.382 --> 06:52.714
and watching you
from a distance.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.015
So just so you know,

06:54.050 --> 06:57.018
we've given Mark
all your personal information.

06:57.053 --> 07:00.355
Your address, your name,
photographs, your social.

07:00.390 --> 07:03.775
So if you go missing,
he knows how to track you down.

07:03.810 --> 07:04.976
Okay.

07:05.027 --> 07:06.228
All right, so, yeah.

07:06.230 --> 07:09.481
- Have a fun night, and uh, yeah.
- Thank you.

07:13.035 --> 07:15.904
I've watched people before,
so... Never had a problem.

07:15.955 --> 07:17.155
Okay.

07:17.206 --> 07:19.124
I'm gonna protect you,
watch you all the time.

07:19.158 --> 07:21.710
Make sure-- I won't keep my eyes
off you at all.

07:21.744 --> 07:23.912
I'll protect you,
make sure you get home.

07:23.914 --> 07:26.331
And I will tuck you in bed.

07:26.382 --> 07:29.418
I'm just gonna tuck you in bed,
and I'm gone.

07:29.469 --> 07:33.422
And make it clear
that I come tuck you in.

07:33.424 --> 07:34.589
Okay.

07:34.591 --> 07:36.675
<i>Mark made Polly feel safe,</i>

07:36.726 --> 07:38.677
<i>and that meant
I could now return to Kevin</i>

07:38.728 --> 07:40.345
<i>and give him everything
he needed</i>

07:40.396 --> 07:44.900
<i>to implement the Daddy's
watching system nationwide.</i>

07:44.934 --> 07:47.519
<i>It felt so good to help
a struggling business.</i>

07:47.570 --> 07:48.737
<i>But I left that day knowing</i>

07:48.771 --> 07:51.990
<i>that I also helped make
the world a safer place.</i>

07:52.024 --> 07:53.658
Hey, I just--
I moved away from here.

07:53.693 --> 07:55.026
If you don't mind--
you give me a couple seconds.

07:55.077 --> 07:57.162
I just wanted--take a picture
'cause I moved.

07:57.196 --> 07:58.530
Oh, um,
I don't have a camera.

07:58.581 --> 07:59.948
Camera's in here.

07:59.950 --> 08:01.283
Sorry?

08:01.285 --> 08:02.751
Okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:02.785 --> 08:04.252
- No, come here.
- Oh, it's fine.

08:04.287 --> 08:07.456
Stay right here.
No, come here.

08:12.716 --> 08:13.883
Whoop.

08:16.352 --> 08:17.552
I assume most
of you are impressed

08:17.604 --> 08:21.223
by how much I accomplish
every week on my show.

08:21.274 --> 08:23.392
Which is why
I get so many people asking me

08:23.394 --> 08:25.894
how I stay so productive.

08:25.945 --> 08:28.280
Well, the secret is finding
that one thing

08:28.314 --> 08:31.316
that motivates you more
than anything else.

08:31.367 --> 08:36.154
And for me that thing
is fear of embarrassment.

08:36.205 --> 08:38.573
<i>When I need to stay motivated
to complete a task,</i>

08:38.625 --> 08:40.292
<i>such as writing
my first screenplay--</i>

08:40.326 --> 08:42.660
<i>a passion project
I've been working on--</i>

08:42.712 --> 08:45.047
<i>I'll often set up a camera
and take a photo of myself</i>

08:45.081 --> 08:46.999
<i>in an embarrassing position,</i>

08:47.050 --> 08:51.586
<i>like posing as the meat
in a human hot dog.</i>

08:51.588 --> 08:54.006
<i>I'll then print out the photo
and place it in an envelope</i>

08:54.057 --> 08:55.340
<i>addressed to my grandma,</i>

08:55.391 --> 08:58.093
<i>someone who I'd never
want to see me this way.</i>

08:58.095 --> 09:00.178
<i>Next, I'll hand-deliver
the shameful photo</i>

09:00.229 --> 09:03.348
<i>to a nearby notary
who I instruct to mail it out</i>

09:03.399 --> 09:06.852
<i>if, and only if, I don't show
proof of my completed screenplay</i>

09:06.903 --> 09:09.604
<i>in two weeks time.</i>

09:09.606 --> 09:11.273
<i>With the real pressure
of disappointing my grandma</i>

09:11.275 --> 09:15.360
<i>upon me, my ability to focus
on my work goes way up.</i>

09:15.411 --> 09:18.664
<i>And I find I'm able to complete
my goals in record time.</i>

09:18.698 --> 09:22.250
<i>Then all it takes is presenting
my completed work to the notary</i>

09:22.285 --> 09:23.251
<i>to reclaim my letter.</i>

09:23.286 --> 09:24.619
Thank you so much.

09:24.671 --> 09:27.122
<i>It's been surprisingly effective
in motivating me,</i>

09:27.124 --> 09:30.258
<i>and I wondered if this technique
could help others as well.</i>

09:30.293 --> 09:32.594
<i>So I put an ad on Craigslist
seeking people</i>

09:32.628 --> 09:33.929
<i>who are trying to lose weight--</i>

09:33.963 --> 09:36.214
<i>something a lot of Americans
struggle with--</i>

09:36.265 --> 09:38.550
<i>and I got several responses
from people</i>

09:38.601 --> 09:40.135
<i>who claim
to have tried everything.</i>

09:40.186 --> 09:42.304
I've got
horrible eating habits.

09:42.355 --> 09:44.139
So I lose weight then gain
weight, lose weight--

09:44.190 --> 09:45.891
It's hard for me
to even find a diet

09:45.942 --> 09:48.310
that's something
that I would stick to.

09:48.361 --> 09:50.946
<i>So it was time to see
if fear of embarrassment</i>

09:50.980 --> 09:52.197
<i>could work for them.</i>

09:52.231 --> 09:53.699
Who's someone in your life

09:53.733 --> 09:57.119
you wouldn't want
to look bad in front of?

09:57.153 --> 09:58.570
I guess my kids.

09:58.621 --> 09:59.988
What's something
that you think

10:00.039 --> 10:02.407
you wouldn't want them to see?

10:02.458 --> 10:04.910
That I...

10:04.961 --> 10:06.378
was having an affair
or something

10:06.412 --> 10:08.630
and was going to leave
their mom.

10:08.664 --> 10:10.465
So what would be the photo?

10:10.500 --> 10:12.000
If that were the line
I was going down,

10:12.051 --> 10:15.420
it'd probably have to be like
me in bed with another woman

10:15.471 --> 10:17.639
that wasn't my wife.

10:17.673 --> 10:20.225
<i>Fred decided the best
motivator for him to lose weight</i>

10:20.259 --> 10:22.511
<i>would be a photo
of him having an affair.</i>

10:22.562 --> 10:25.514
<i>So I had him pose in a bed
with a model I hired</i>

10:25.565 --> 10:27.816
<i>and took a photo to make it look
like he was caught cheating</i>

10:27.850 --> 10:29.317
<i>on his wife.</i>

10:29.352 --> 10:32.070
<i>Then I put it in an envelope
addressed to his children</i>

10:32.105 --> 10:34.523
<i>that would be sent out
if he didn't shed 5 pounds</i>

10:34.574 --> 10:36.191
<i>over the next two weeks.</i>

10:36.193 --> 10:37.909
<i>I tailored similar motivators</i>

10:37.944 --> 10:39.861
<i>for each of the other
participants.</i>

10:39.863 --> 10:41.580
<i>Gina, a schoolteacher, agreed</i>

10:41.614 --> 10:43.865
<i>that a letter to her principal
that reads,</i>

10:43.867 --> 10:46.785
<i>"I'm a little baby
and I love to pee and poo,"</i>

10:46.836 --> 10:49.671
<i>accompanied by a photo of her
giving two middle fingers,</i>

10:49.705 --> 10:52.958
<i>would be sufficient incentive
for her to drop those pounds.</i>

10:53.009 --> 10:54.709
<i>Trici, a legal assistant,</i>

10:54.711 --> 10:56.678
<i>decided that addressing
an embarrassing photo</i>

10:56.712 --> 10:59.631
<i>to one of the lawyers
at her firm would help her out.</i>

10:59.682 --> 11:01.850
<i>And George,
a retired war veteran,</i>

11:01.884 --> 11:04.219
<i>thought my approach
would actually work for him.</i>

11:04.221 --> 11:05.720
I like that situation.

11:05.772 --> 11:07.973
- You would do this?
- I would do that.

11:08.024 --> 11:10.025
- Absolutely.
- Really?

11:10.059 --> 11:11.276
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:11.310 --> 11:12.727
Well, do you want me
to get the costume?

11:12.779 --> 11:13.779
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:13.813 --> 11:15.197
Let's do it.

11:15.231 --> 11:18.066
<i>And after getting George
dressed up as the human hot dog,</i>

11:18.117 --> 11:19.317
<i>I snapped his photo...</i>

11:19.368 --> 11:21.369
Okay, look over here.

11:21.404 --> 11:24.206
<i>then printed out a copy for him
to address to his mother,</i>

11:24.240 --> 11:26.741
<i>someone he didn't want to
embarrass himself in front of.</i>

11:26.743 --> 11:28.910
That would wake her up, yeah.
Definitely.

11:28.961 --> 11:30.495
<i>And after weighing
each of them in,</i>

11:30.546 --> 11:33.498
<i>I gave them two weeks
to lose 5 pounds.</i>

11:33.549 --> 11:35.917
<i>So we'll check in later
to see how they did.</i>

11:35.968 --> 11:37.919
<i>But first...</i>

11:37.921 --> 11:40.173
<i>Veronique Assouline
is one of Beverly Hills'</i>

11:40.243 --> 11:41.756
<i>premiere party planners.</i>

11:41.808 --> 11:43.592
<i>And she has big hopes of taking
her company,</i>

11:43.643 --> 11:46.094
<i>Veronique Events,
to the next level.</i>

11:46.096 --> 11:48.146
My wish is to be
a bigger company

11:48.181 --> 11:51.983
with a lot of artistic directors
and, you know, a whole crew.

11:52.018 --> 11:53.935
<i>But to do this, she's going
to need something</i>

11:53.937 --> 11:56.238
<i>that makes her different
than everyone else.</i>

11:56.272 --> 11:58.857
<i>So I paid Veronique a visit
to see if I could help.</i>

11:58.908 --> 11:59.908
Hey.

11:59.942 --> 12:01.243
Oh, jeez--

12:01.277 --> 12:02.360
When someone's having a party,

12:02.411 --> 12:05.280
the biggest stress comes
from who to invite.

12:05.331 --> 12:06.781
- Absolutely.
- I mean, sometimes

12:06.833 --> 12:07.999
There are just people
you don't want to invite.

12:08.034 --> 12:09.584
Yes.

12:09.619 --> 12:12.420
But you don't want them
to know you didn't invite them

12:12.455 --> 12:13.955
Because then they'll hate you.

12:13.957 --> 12:16.174
But you don't want them to know
that you don't like them.

12:16.209 --> 12:18.093
- Right?
- Yeah. But the thing is,

12:18.127 --> 12:20.295
you have to make choices.

12:20.297 --> 12:21.963
But maybe you don't.

12:22.014 --> 12:24.167
<i>These days, most party
invitations are sent</i>

12:24.217 --> 12:26.301
<i>as a digital invite
through email.</i>

12:26.303 --> 12:29.221
<i>So if it was possible to develop
a technology that could send</i>

12:29.272 --> 12:32.224
<i>certain people's invites
directly to their spam folder,</i>

12:32.275 --> 12:35.694
<i>Veronique's clients could invite
everyone they know to a party,</i>

12:35.728 --> 12:39.314
<i>while guaranteeing their
undesired guest won't show up.</i>

12:39.365 --> 12:41.650
<i>And if confronted after
the event by that guest,</i>

12:41.701 --> 12:43.201
<i>they could simply say,</i>

12:43.236 --> 12:47.155
<i>"I did invite you.
Did you check your spam?"</i>

12:47.157 --> 12:49.040
That is a ga--
great trick.

12:49.075 --> 12:52.160
I mean, as the only party
planner to provide this service,

12:52.211 --> 12:55.997
you would get everyone wanting
you to plan their party.

12:56.048 --> 12:58.166
You know,
I want to see how it works.

12:58.168 --> 13:00.802
I would love
to have this information.

13:00.836 --> 13:04.089
And then if I have the use, yes.
Why not using it?

13:04.140 --> 13:06.558
<i>Before Veronique could offer
this service to her clients,</i>

13:06.592 --> 13:09.678
<i>I'd first need to create
the technology to make it work.</i>

13:09.729 --> 13:12.063
<i>So I hired a software engineer
named Chris,</i>

13:12.098 --> 13:15.850
<i>who built me a custom invitation
system to execute my idea.</i>

13:15.852 --> 13:17.986
All right, so this is
the invitation form.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.237
- Right.
- And then on this side

13:19.272 --> 13:21.856
you enter the emails
with your desired guests

13:21.858 --> 13:23.325
and your undesired guests.

13:23.359 --> 13:25.360
So the emails in here
go where?

13:25.362 --> 13:28.446
The desired guests emails
will be sent to the inbox.

13:28.497 --> 13:29.864
But with the undesired guests

13:29.866 --> 13:32.250
I just put a whole bunch
of spam words in that email,

13:32.285 --> 13:35.203
sent it through a foreign server
that was located in russia.

13:35.254 --> 13:36.671
- So that makes it go to spam--
- Yeah.

13:36.706 --> 13:38.039
So that makes it go to spam.

13:38.090 --> 13:39.958
And what words did you use?

13:40.009 --> 13:43.595
Um, I used "Viagra", "penis",
"penis enlargements",

13:43.629 --> 13:45.680
I put everything from
1-inch penis all the way

13:45.715 --> 13:46.881
to 10-inch penis.

13:46.883 --> 13:49.100
Why 1-inch penis?

13:49.135 --> 13:51.686
Uh, because it's just more
to put in there.

13:51.721 --> 13:53.888
'cause I've seen spam
for like, 8-inch penis,

13:53.940 --> 13:55.273
- 9--
- Yeah.

13:55.308 --> 13:57.609
But I've never seen someone--
a spam email say, like,

13:57.643 --> 13:59.694
"Do you want a 1-inch penis?"

14:04.784 --> 14:05.984
But yeah.

14:06.035 --> 14:07.235
It seems like you did
a good job.

14:07.286 --> 14:08.536
Yeah.

14:08.571 --> 14:10.405
<i>Chris sent a test invite
to my email</i>

14:10.456 --> 14:11.906
<i>and it seemed to work great</i>

14:11.958 --> 14:13.825
<i>with the hidden keywords
directing it</i>

14:13.876 --> 14:15.827
<i>straight to my spam folder.</i>

14:15.878 --> 14:17.212
There it is.

14:17.246 --> 14:19.464
<i>So the next day, I returned
to Veronique to show her</i>

14:19.498 --> 14:20.715
<i>what I had developed.</i>

14:20.750 --> 14:22.000
Oh!

14:22.051 --> 14:23.718
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Jesus Christ.

14:23.753 --> 14:26.504
The program will add hidden
words to those emails

14:26.555 --> 14:28.423
that will make them go
directly to spam.

14:28.474 --> 14:30.925
- Oh.
- There's "penis", "rolex"--

14:30.977 --> 14:32.093
I mean the idea is--

14:32.095 --> 14:34.095
- Uh, "penis enlargement"...
- Oh.

14:34.097 --> 14:37.399
"Viagra", "8-inch penis",
"9-inch penis",

14:37.433 --> 14:38.566
"10-inch penis",

14:38.601 --> 14:39.985
- "11-inch penis"...
- Good.

14:40.019 --> 14:41.236
"Viagra penis"--

14:41.270 --> 14:42.904
I mean, I don't need to know
exactly--

14:42.938 --> 14:45.273
Is it important for me to know
all this information?

14:45.275 --> 14:46.858
If any of your clients ask,
you should know.

14:46.909 --> 14:48.109
No,
nobody would be interested.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.110
Well, some people
might want to know how it works.

14:49.161 --> 14:50.695
It's interesting science.

14:50.746 --> 14:51.946
<i>Veronique was impressed.</i>

14:51.998 --> 14:54.165
<i>But in order to show her
the psychological impact</i>

14:54.200 --> 14:55.834
<i>my system would have,</i>

14:55.868 --> 14:57.869
<i>I decided to throw
a small party at my place</i>

14:57.920 --> 15:01.539
<i>and put someone that I know
on the undesired guest list.</i>

15:01.590 --> 15:03.875
<i>For this, I chose Salomon,
who works on my show,</i>

15:03.926 --> 15:05.343
<i>because I knew it
would hurt his feelings</i>

15:05.378 --> 15:07.796
<i>if he found out
he wasn't invited.</i>

15:07.847 --> 15:08.847
<i>So after sending the invites,</i>

15:08.881 --> 15:11.216
<i>I headed home to prepare
for my party.</i>

15:13.607 --> 15:16.042
<i>My plan was to take photos
of the event,</i>

15:16.044 --> 15:17.460
<i>and then post them online</i>

15:17.511 --> 15:20.847
<i>so Salomon would see he missed
out on a really fun party.</i>

15:20.881 --> 15:23.516
<i>Unfortunately, the few desired
guests I invited said</i>

15:23.550 --> 15:25.969
<i>they couldn't make it
on such short notice.</i>

15:26.020 --> 15:27.604
<i>But I still felt
Veronique and I</i>

15:27.638 --> 15:32.725
<i>were enough to have a party.</i>

15:32.727 --> 15:34.394
Do you... speak French,

15:34.445 --> 15:38.114
Or is it
just the accent you do?

15:38.148 --> 15:39.899
No, I speak French.

15:39.950 --> 15:41.419
Oh, okay.

15:42.237 --> 15:43.287
And I don't want to be rude,

15:43.322 --> 15:45.525
but I really have to leave
soon so...

15:45.606 --> 15:47.307
<i>With Veronique
on the verge of leaving,</i>

15:47.358 --> 15:49.129
<i>I was hopeful the entertainment
I hired</i>

15:49.171 --> 15:50.705
<i>would turn things around--</i>

15:50.719 --> 15:52.603
<i>a professional Bill Gates
impersonator</i>

15:52.637 --> 15:54.610
<i>who I'd worked with in the past.</i>

15:54.641 --> 15:56.425
It's really great to be here.

15:56.476 --> 15:58.927
There's nothing like a party.

15:58.978 --> 16:00.679
You know, uh...

16:00.681 --> 16:03.432
You work hard all your life,

16:03.483 --> 16:07.686
especially trying to get
Microsoft working.

16:07.737 --> 16:10.155
I mean, Microsoft.

16:10.189 --> 16:12.357
What would we have done
without it?

16:12.408 --> 16:15.994
In the office days-- older office
days, in the '80s,

16:16.029 --> 16:20.332
you had big computers
in a room.

16:20.366 --> 16:22.701
I mean, enormous.

16:22.703 --> 16:25.370
And look at the technology now.

16:25.372 --> 16:29.041
It takes a inventive mind

16:29.043 --> 16:35.047
To run and invent...
this Microsoft.

16:35.049 --> 16:38.350
And I'm very happy.

16:43.690 --> 16:46.858
<i>After Bill's performance
the party had reached its peak,</i>

16:46.893 --> 16:49.611
<i>so the only thing left to do was
take some photos of the event</i>

16:49.646 --> 16:51.730
<i>before Veronique had to go.</i>

16:51.732 --> 16:54.900
<i>And after an hour of getting to
know the man behind Bill Gates--</i>

16:54.902 --> 16:57.569
Why were you circumcised twice?

16:57.571 --> 17:00.455
Well, the first time, um...

17:00.490 --> 17:02.491
there was a problem
with the foreskin.

17:02.542 --> 17:03.875
<i>I wrapped things up,</i>

17:03.910 --> 17:06.712
<i>and the next day, I posted
my party pics on Facebook,</i>

17:06.746 --> 17:09.414
<i>where I was sure Salomon
would see them.</i>

17:09.415 --> 17:10.632
<i>With everything in place,</i>

17:10.666 --> 17:13.502
<i>It was now time to test
the impact of my idea.</i>

17:13.749 --> 17:15.844
<i>So I brought Veronique
into the office</i>

17:15.877 --> 17:17.617
<i>for her to see
it all unfold.</i>

17:17.619 --> 17:19.203
Why didn't you come?

17:19.253 --> 17:21.204
Uh, didn't know about it.

17:21.256 --> 17:22.290
Oh, really?

17:22.340 --> 17:23.674
Yeah, I didn't know about it.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.760
I invited you.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.127
I didn't see the...

17:27.179 --> 17:28.462
You check your spam?

17:28.513 --> 17:31.299
I'm gonna check right now.

17:31.301 --> 17:34.135
- Yeah, it went to, uh, spam.
- Oh...

17:34.186 --> 17:35.803
That's too bad.

17:35.854 --> 17:38.556
Did you think for a sec
that I didn't invite you or--

17:38.607 --> 17:40.024
- Yeah, I thought. Yes.
- You thought

17:40.058 --> 17:41.442
- I didn't invite you.
- Yes.

17:41.476 --> 17:43.227
- But really...
- It was the email's fault.

17:43.278 --> 17:44.706
It was the email's fault,
yeah.

17:48.066 --> 17:49.150
All right.
Cool.

17:49.201 --> 17:50.451
Well, catch you later then.

17:50.485 --> 17:51.485
Okay.

17:51.537 --> 17:52.570
Huh?

17:52.621 --> 17:53.621
- Good.
- Pretty good, huh?

17:53.655 --> 17:54.822
Yep.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.457
So he thought at first
I didn't like him.

17:56.491 --> 17:57.658
- Yeah.
- But then he realized,

17:57.660 --> 17:58.876
"Oh, it was just
the email's fault."

17:58.911 --> 18:00.828
- Yeah.
- And he didn't come

18:00.879 --> 18:02.496
- to the party.
- Yeah.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.881
So you going to use it or...

18:03.916 --> 18:07.084
I mean, let me check first,
on a few--

18:07.135 --> 18:08.302
You saw his reaction, right?

18:08.337 --> 18:10.338
- Yeah, the reaction--I mean--
- Pretty good.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.889
The reaction was what you
expect on paper but, um...

18:11.924 --> 18:13.841
Yes, exactly.
Yeah.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.059
Thank you very much.

18:15.093 --> 18:16.894
Oh, did you want
a hug or anything or...

18:16.929 --> 18:18.429
- No, it's okay, I'm good.
- Okay.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.764
- Thank you very much
- I'll see you later.

18:19.815 --> 18:21.265
Bye.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.909
<i>It's been two weeks since
Gina, Trici, Fred and George</i>

18:32.099 --> 18:35.068
<i>committed to losing weight using
fear of embarrassment.</i>

18:35.505 --> 18:37.673
<i>So it was finally time
to come back to the office</i>

18:37.675 --> 18:41.560
<i>to see if they each met their
goal of losing 5 pounds.</i>

18:41.595 --> 18:44.430
Before, Fred, you were 270.

18:44.481 --> 18:47.182
Now you're 257.

18:47.234 --> 18:49.818
You lost 13 pounds.

18:49.853 --> 18:51.487
Wow.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.522
I don't believe it.
That's wild.

18:53.524 --> 18:54.773
<i>I was blown away.</i>

18:54.824 --> 18:57.359
<i>My method seemed to help
everyone meet their goal,</i>

18:57.410 --> 18:58.994
<i>except for one person.</i>

18:59.029 --> 19:00.351
Oh, my God.

19:00.424 --> 19:03.342
<i>Traci was a pound shy
of the 5 we agreed upon.</i>

19:03.344 --> 19:05.394
I thought I lost it.

19:05.429 --> 19:07.930
<i>And that meant I had to uphold
my end of the bargain,</i>

19:07.981 --> 19:10.649
<i>and send her embarrassing photo
to an attorney</i>

19:10.684 --> 19:12.818
<i>at the law firm she worked at.</i>

19:12.853 --> 19:14.019
My God.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.272
<i>So the next day,
I met Trici at her office</i>

19:16.323 --> 19:17.656
<i>to give her emotional support</i>

19:17.691 --> 19:19.525
<i>as she hand-delivered her letter</i>

19:19.527 --> 19:21.360
<i>to one of the firm's
founding partners.</i>

19:21.362 --> 19:22.578
I wanna introduce you
to a friend of mine.

19:22.612 --> 19:24.697
- This is Nathan.
- Hi, Nathan.

19:24.748 --> 19:25.865
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

19:25.867 --> 19:27.333
- This is Michael.
- Good to meet you.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.701
The attorney that works
in our office, in our firm.

19:28.703 --> 19:31.120
What's your relationship
with-- with her?

19:31.171 --> 19:33.289
Well, Trici's been involved

19:33.340 --> 19:35.091
in a new type of
weight loss program.

19:35.125 --> 19:36.375
Oh.

19:36.377 --> 19:38.794
Unfortunately,
she didn't meet her recent goal,

19:38.845 --> 19:42.047
and she has something
that she needs to show you.

19:42.099 --> 19:45.718
But before she does,
I just want you to promise me

19:45.769 --> 19:47.887
that you won't pass any judgment
on her.

19:47.889 --> 19:49.054
Oh, yeah.
Okay.

19:49.056 --> 19:50.723
- So Trici, did you want to...
- Yes.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.224
You want me to show him?

19:52.226 --> 19:54.110
Well, it's your thing.
It's not me.

19:54.144 --> 19:56.112
- This is it.
- Okay.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.068
Wow.
Wow.

20:03.070 --> 20:05.237
- I see what you mean.
- This--

20:05.288 --> 20:07.540
Uh, okay.
Um...

20:07.574 --> 20:08.824
Well, let me say this.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.710
- To submit something like this...
- Mm-hmm.

20:11.745 --> 20:13.129
to a Jewish member
of the firm--

20:13.163 --> 20:16.081
a long-standing member here
for 35 years--

20:16.083 --> 20:19.418
is very hard for me
to think kindly of you

20:19.420 --> 20:21.754
or to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.589
<i>At first, Michael
didn't seem to get it.</i>

20:23.640 --> 20:24.807
<i>But after some explaining,</i>

20:24.841 --> 20:27.393
<i>he could finally accept
Trici's approach.</i>

20:27.427 --> 20:29.395
It's a tactic to get me
to lose weight,

20:29.429 --> 20:31.680
to help me to motivate me
to lose weight.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.265
Anyone that did hate Jews

20:33.316 --> 20:35.734
wouldn't care about that photo
being sent out.

20:35.769 --> 20:37.736
So you're saying
these are not your sentiments?

20:37.771 --> 20:42.107
Sir, clearly, I'm letting
you know I do <i>not</i> hate Jews.

20:42.159 --> 20:43.442
- Okay.
- And I'm sorry if I came...

20:43.444 --> 20:44.443
She really--

20:44.494 --> 20:45.778
under the wrong pretenses
to you--

20:45.829 --> 20:47.246
Okay.
If it's for weight loss

20:47.280 --> 20:50.315
And she explained it clearly,
like she did a few minutes ago--

20:50.380 --> 20:52.380
- Mm-hmm.
- then I would accept it.

20:52.707 --> 20:54.348
It's a motivator.
