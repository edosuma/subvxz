00:45.920 --> 00:48.491
Former New York socialite
Judith Case and John Raymond

00:48.680 --> 00:53.402
are joined by Satan in unholy wedlock
before a live altar, a nude red head.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.961
Self-ordained sorcerer,
Minister Anton La Vey

00:56.160 --> 00:58.288
presided at the San Francisco ceremony.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.721
As the worst man looks on, the blessings
of Lucifer and Beelzebub are invoked.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.804
The elaborate rites smacked
of publicity because next day,

01:09.000 --> 01:11.810
the bride and groom secured
a conventional wedding license.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.322
Two days in LA to go on my dark tour.
David has to handle it.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.010
Two days!

03:23.160 --> 03:24.764
Cannot believe I agreed to this shit.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.809
Chlo, you wanna hit off this J?

03:26.960 --> 03:28.007
No, I'm good, thanks.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.049
Hey, will you open a fucking window?

03:30.800 --> 03:32.768
LA, spread your legs.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.943
So tired, I can barely get high.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.330
Too dark.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.408
Keeps burning through that memory, Chlo.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.483
You guys are like
a fucking Apple commercial.

03:43.480 --> 03:44.845
Devil face.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.888
Oh, my God, that was so KISS.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.286
Knights In Satan's Service.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.726
KISS worshiped pussy, not Satan.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.127
- Hey, don't we all?
- I hate that word.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.044
What? Seth said it, not me.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.009
Hit him anyway, Chlo, they love it.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.044
Where the fuck are we?

04:05.200 --> 04:06.929
Good evening, Los Angeles.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.202
And we are officially lost.

04:09.760 --> 04:10.761
Damn it.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.684
The arrow shows Flower. Is this Flower?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.649
No, this is Santa Fe.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.404
Hey, should we get back on the highway?

04:17.560 --> 04:19.084
Are you sure you had the GPS on?

04:19.240 --> 04:20.526
I don't know, do I?

04:22.400 --> 04:24.448
Nope, 'cause I'm an idiot.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.127
Ah... ha-ha, there she is.
Welcome back, Kim.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.645
I'm sorry, you call her Kim?

04:31.800 --> 04:33.040
Don't ask.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.408
Okay, hello to you, too.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.331
Junkies and whores.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.403
Welcome to La La Land, darling.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.886
Right, there it is.
Let's get the hell out of here.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.801
Yes.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.445
Elise Stevens.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.291
Two nights, right?

05:23.440 --> 05:26.364
Yeah, and specifically requested room 204.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.884
Laney Gore bled on the floor in 204.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.124
- That's the shit, bro.
- So the shit.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.241
Who the hell's Laney Gore?

05:39.440 --> 05:41.169
One of many surprises we have in store.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.570
Hey, play nice.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.850
I am playing nice.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.929
Laney!

05:55.600 --> 05:57.602
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.885
- Smell that asbestos.
- Oh, wow.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.202
Nice. What a shit hole.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.044
Oh, my God. Look at this.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.604
Seth, I think this is where it happened.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.645
- Matches the photograph, right?
- Yeah.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.326
Hey, this isn't a suite, it's a dump.

06:14.480 --> 06:15.970
Why did we pay an extra 20?

06:16.760 --> 06:20.048
Room 204. Laney Gore slit her throat here.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.690
- What?
- Yep.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.526
1972. One of the early sisters
of LaVey's Church of Satan.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.689
Check out the bloodstains like wet paint.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.091
Oh, my God. It is the same. David, look.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.163
Yeah. Fucking awesome.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.008
Hey, why are we here and not Coachella?

06:40.160 --> 06:43.243
Because Chloe's my best friend
and you're on her leash. Okay?

06:43.400 --> 06:46.529
- And you're on mine, bitch.
- You wish, bitch.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.168
Hey, you guys really want to stay here?

06:55.480 --> 06:58.290
- Yeah.
- Darling, this is why we came.

06:58.480 --> 06:59.481
Right?

06:59.640 --> 07:01.130
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.641
David, are you okay with this?

07:04.280 --> 07:07.011
- He can't hear you.
- He's sleeping.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.440
Get back here!

07:50.080 --> 07:52.526
Oh, my savior.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.006
Nice neighbors we have.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.730
Yeah, this place is a squatter's paradise.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.466
You get a needle at check-in.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.364
Anything?

08:00.520 --> 08:02.124
I thought I felt something
a while ago, but...

08:02.440 --> 08:03.965
Yeah. Well, maybe that
was just Milton Bradley

08:04.080 --> 08:06.560
- pocketing your 20 bucks.
- I felt something.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.841
- I swear to God.
- Ask it something.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.201
Hello.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.361
Who are you?

08:15.720 --> 08:17.131
Are you Laney Gore?

08:19.640 --> 08:20.721
What do you decree?

08:21.880 --> 08:23.451
"What do you decree?"

08:23.600 --> 08:24.761
Hey.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.489
Oh, my God, Seth,
you're totally doing that.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.721
I'm not.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.647
What do you want? What do you want?
What do you want?

08:50.280 --> 08:51.361
"B."

09:06.600 --> 09:07.761
"J."

09:08.480 --> 09:09.481
"BJ."

09:09.640 --> 09:11.324
Oh, my God, it's like
we're thinking the same thing!

09:11.520 --> 09:13.921
Seth! You little fucking prick!

09:14.980 --> 09:16.401
Fucking goth troll.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.449
- Yeah, my goth troll.
- Bullshit.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.329
Come on, it's cool.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.245
It's not cool,
nobody's taking this seriously!

09:23.400 --> 09:25.562
Okay. Sorry, your bullshit
Satanic tourism,

09:25.760 --> 09:28.445
- I have to take this seriously?
- It's not Satanic tourism,

09:28.640 --> 09:30.768
it's about understanding the dark natures.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.008
Wow, that's very Aleister Crowley of you.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.161
You know what? Fuck you, David.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.651
If you didn't wanna do this,
why'd you come?

09:35.840 --> 09:36.841
To get a BJ.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.200
Hey, I've got that department covered.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.281
Oh, do you?

09:39.400 --> 09:40.840
If you guys are gonna
shit around all weekend,

09:40.920 --> 09:42.206
maybe we should just
blow this whole thing off

09:42.320 --> 09:44.687
and go to Coachella.
This isn't bullshit for me, okay?

09:45.280 --> 09:48.887
I mean, would it kill you, David, to open
your fucking mind and be a free spirit?

09:49.040 --> 09:51.725
I swear to God, I can't deal
with this frat-boy shit!

09:51.880 --> 09:55.646
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Tension release.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.010
We'll have our coffee.
And from now on they'll behave.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.087
Come on, it's Spring Break.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.529
Come on, LA for two nights,
and then Coachella, right?

10:05.680 --> 10:09.127
Look, we're on board. Our minds are open.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.201
Yeah?

10:13.600 --> 10:17.321
So... you tell me. What's the plan?

10:24.720 --> 10:25.926
All righty.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.491
- Everybody get together.
- Mm-hm.

10:27.640 --> 10:28.687
- Come on!
- Ow!

10:28.840 --> 10:29.841
- Cheer up!
- Yeah.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.731
- 'Kay? This is where Satan lives.
- Okay. This is happening.

10:34.320 --> 10:39.486
Oh... Cute.
Check out the cross, it's kick-ass.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.486
It's cool.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.971
Oh, my God.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.526
We love your look.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.601
They're friendly.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.121
Hey!

10:58.760 --> 11:00.728
Uh... Dude, uh, we're trying
to find the Sharon Tate house...

11:00.920 --> 11:01.921
Fuck off.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.963
Yeah, well, fuck you, too!

11:13.340 --> 11:15.650
Colossal waste of time, take two.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.768
Sick. I'm gonna use this
as my screen saver.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.445
Color-tone the shit out of it.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.404
Hey, did we ever find out
where her house is?

11:23.920 --> 11:25.285
Go suck cock, bitch.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.726
David, no.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.202
Yeah, go suck the devil's cock, bitch!

11:32.680 --> 11:34.648
Oh, my God. Good one, Dave.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.724
- Fucker loogied all over my window.
- Welcome to LA.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.970
- No shit!
- This city sucks.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.602
All right. First ones here.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.726
Only ones here.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.923
Sorry, why are we not at a
taping of Two and A Half Men?

11:58.080 --> 12:00.526
Chloe, can you keep his negative
energy away from me, please?

12:00.760 --> 12:03.206
And, David, that shitty show's
been canceled.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.483
Just like the photos. Insanely awesome.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.881
Oh, my God. Were people
really murdered here?

12:09.360 --> 12:10.600
Bloody and cold.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.850
Seth, we got to find a way
around the back.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.121
Yeah.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.640
Can you get the hell out of the way?

12:30.400 --> 12:31.401
Dick.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.890
Wow, Dave, you're just an asshole magnet.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.849
Yeah, no shit. I'm here with you.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.968
Oh, my God. Dave, do you ever
get tired of being wrong?

12:41.780 --> 12:44.329
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.164
All right. Yeah.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.561
They came this way about ten PM,

12:53.080 --> 12:54.809
up the hill, to the backyard.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.931
Big-ass hill. Jesus,
what were they? Sherpas?

12:59.080 --> 13:00.241
Why'd they do it?

13:00.400 --> 13:02.402
Manson thought some record
producer that fucked him over

13:02.560 --> 13:05.006
was still living here.
He was actually the target.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.810
Wrong place, wrong time, eh?

13:06.960 --> 13:08.724
On steroids. Slit her stomach open.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.723
- She was fuckin' pregnant.
- Seth!

13:11.560 --> 13:13.244
Oh, my God, it's so pretty.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.131
I know, that's what makes it so creepy.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.240
Seth, get a picture of us.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.566
Chloe!

13:21.120 --> 13:22.406
- I don't want to.
- Chloe.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.370
No. Fine.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.411
- Say "Charlie."
- Charlie.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.649
Yep. Totally worth it.

13:37.840 --> 13:40.161
1641 Cahuenga.

13:40.320 --> 13:44.006
Okay. So, now we're touring porn shops.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.961
Nah, dick, they just don't advertise.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.490
Call me a dick again, Seth...

13:50.960 --> 13:55.488
Dude. Dave. You gotta chill, bro.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.730
He's right. You need to chill.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.167
Chlo, do you know how much shit
we're missing right now?

14:00.360 --> 14:01.441
It's almost over.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.364
I'm just saying. She's your cousin. Okay?

14:03.520 --> 14:05.682
I barely tolerate her
and I don't like Seth.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.001
- David.
- Seriously.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.611
They don't even offer gas money.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.491
Oh, my God, will you guys
fucking grow a pair?

14:11.680 --> 14:13.523
Seriously. Hell, fuck.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.929
Oh, I have a pair, Morticia.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.686
Big pair.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.682
Blow my fucking mind.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.048
Oh, how spine-tingly awesome.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.330
Seth, check it out.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.808
Mmm... incantations.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.847
Check it out. How wet are you right now?

15:00.360 --> 15:01.486
Oh.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.327
That's rad.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.521
Boo!

15:15.960 --> 15:18.770
- A bad hand-job.
- Good one, Dave.

15:18.920 --> 15:20.888
- Is it real?
- It's mummified.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.201
Taken from the body
of a convicted child murderer.

15:25.160 --> 15:28.084
Killed a ten year-old girl
back in Modesto in '85.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.001
Satanic Panic.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.408
Cases like this all over
Southern Cali, right?

15:33.560 --> 15:34.766
The Panic was a myth.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.287
This asshole was a killer and a pedophile.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.649
Satan had nothing to do with it.

15:40.160 --> 15:43.323
Yet, here he is, on display in your shop.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.450
- Yo, how much?
- Not for sale.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.681
What about this?

15:49.080 --> 15:52.289
- You know Coptic Greek?
- I can read.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.324
You need the accent for the incantations.

15:58.240 --> 15:59.446
It wouldn't work for you.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.451
Asshole.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.008
Well, I guess you're not
ready for the Dark Embrace.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.366
You see his tattoo?

16:08.520 --> 16:11.126
Yeah, upside down cross. Very original.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.121
Out.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.448
Yeah, yeah. It's cool.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.682
- Now, fucker!
- Or what?

16:47.400 --> 16:49.562
Are you gonna
spill some pig's blood on me?

16:49.720 --> 16:51.563
No, just cut your fucking heart out.

16:53.120 --> 16:56.567
Hey... Place is horseshit.
All right. Let's go.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.841
Poser dick fucks. Shop sucks.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.606
Well, that went splendidly.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.006
I'm gonna burn this place on Yelp.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.680
Enough of this shit.
We're doing the Starline Tour.

17:15.839 --> 17:16.840
Dave at the wheel.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.809
- I hate your van, Dave.
- It hates you.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.486
I'm serious, it was like a shrine.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.563
It had goats' eyes and dried intestines.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.563
Oh, my God. Are we still
in that little Satan shop?

18:11.720 --> 18:12.721
It's a sacrificial circle.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.531
They give gifts to Lucifer,
in turn, he grants power.

18:15.680 --> 18:19.002
Wow. Goat eyes and pig balls.
The gifts that keep on giving.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.891
We should head back there.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.851
Follow him and see where he goes.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.530
Probably back to his mom's basement.

18:25.680 --> 18:27.011
Seth's right. We should follow him.

18:27.160 --> 18:29.811
- What, are you serious?
- Come on, it'll be fun.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.645
I guarantee it'll lead somewhere dark.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.371
You can't just tail someone
for fun. There are laws.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.090
Yeah, talk to Google about that.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.720
Nancy Drew did it all the time,
nobody gave her shit.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.564
I'd say we're more like that Scooby gang

18:40.760 --> 18:42.091
with this piece-of-shit van.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.210
Dude, I paid 1,200 cash with
140,000 miles in that engine,

18:45.360 --> 18:48.284
- and it kicks your fucking goth ass.
- Such a piece of shit.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.642
Insult that van one more time,
we will have serious words.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.448
Maybe we should just check out
and head to Coachella.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.285
Oh, Chlo, stop being a bitch.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.489
She's not a bitch... she's lame.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.406
Hey, that asshole had a blade on him,
who knows what those people are into.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.050
I thought he lives in his mom's basement?

19:06.200 --> 19:08.009
It doesn't mean he's not a wacko.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.884
Hey, Chloe, come on.
The guy's a total puss.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.405
Oh, with a devil shrine in the back room?

19:11.560 --> 19:14.245
Yeah, well, one devil shrine
does not a douchebag make.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.528
Honestly, these people probably
circle-jerk to Marilyn Manson

19:16.680 --> 19:19.286
- and call it a day.
- Okay, let's put it to a vote.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.003
Who wants to follow numbnuts
to his little tree fort

19:23.160 --> 19:24.161
of demonic possession?

19:28.800 --> 19:30.131
Yeah!

19:30.280 --> 19:31.361
- David.
- What?

19:31.560 --> 19:34.928
Babe, I'm sorry, I love you,
but I need a little excitement.

19:36.320 --> 19:38.084
Chloe, you're out-voted. Terribly sorry.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.482
Yay, we're going spying!

19:42.360 --> 19:43.521
Yes!

19:43.680 --> 19:45.842
Hey, if you don't wanna go, we won't go.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.569
David's right, you owe gas money.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.802
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.365
Yo, here.

19:56.160 --> 19:57.321
Thank you.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.810
Fucking peer pressure.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.806
Come here, darling.

20:05.880 --> 20:06.881
Tongue!

20:08.040 --> 20:09.326
Use your tongue.

20:10.760 --> 20:11.761
Tongue!

20:56.080 --> 20:58.401
David. David.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.528
They're heading out.
Hey, guys, they're heading out.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.725
Oh, that fuckin'
bald-headed piece of shit.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.004
Fucking bald motherfucker.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.123
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, he's gonna
get away! Come on.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.486
Yeah, the hell they are.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.881
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

21:32.040 --> 21:33.520
- Hey, don't lose him.
- Floor it, Dave!

21:33.600 --> 21:35.967
Floor it, Dave! He just ran the red.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.089
Hold on, I'm blowin' through it.

21:39.560 --> 21:42.643
Yeah! No fear! No fear!

21:42.800 --> 21:44.564
Yeah, that's right, bitch,
I know how to tail.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.480
They're in the right. Right, right, right.

21:47.560 --> 21:48.920
- Turning right.
- I see him, grommet.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.411
Seth, he sees him.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.169
I think they're headed towards the coast.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.125
Yep, that is exactly where they're going.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.884
Dave, I find myself apologizing.

22:04.040 --> 22:05.565
This van actually does kick my ass.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.285
Dude, it's a stealth fucking fighter.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.851
God, I'm loving their black tint.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.047
Maybe they're vampires.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.201
Ha! No shit, right?

22:11.360 --> 22:13.010
- How much fun is this?
- Yes!

22:13.160 --> 22:15.322
Hey, yo, not to spoil
the moment or anything,

22:15.520 --> 22:18.000
but does anyone know what the fuck
we're gonna do once we stop?

22:18.160 --> 22:19.605
That's what makes it so much fun, Dave.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.366
- No idea.
- Okay.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.160
Yo.

22:56.160 --> 22:57.571
Dude, don't let them get away.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.967
- I got 'em. I got 'em.
- I think we're in Malibu.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.531
Posh Satanists.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.444
Yeah. They probably
have a fuckin' reality show.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.721
This is exciting. I'm, like, gonna pee.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.641
Okay. Now this feels like trespassing.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.205
Let's go back.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.962
David! David, kill the headlights,
they're gonna spot us.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.531
Fuck you, man. I can't see shit.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.051
No, he's right. They'll spot us.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.201
Damn it.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.565
- Fuck, it's dark.
- Oh, shit.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.767
Oh, fuck.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.726
- Damn, it's dark.
- Fuck.

23:42.880 --> 23:44.291
You know,
I'm gonna drive us off this cliff,

23:44.480 --> 23:45.481
I swear to Christ.

23:45.640 --> 23:47.130
You're doing a good job, babe.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.405
Oh. Check out this house.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.008
Of course it's a shit hole.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.002
- Pull over.
- All right, all right.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.447
- They will see us.
- No, we're too far away.

24:20.800 --> 24:22.086
All right, from here we walk.

24:22.240 --> 24:24.049
Seth, there's a flashlight on the floor.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.041
Got it.

24:29.440 --> 24:30.805
Shh, quiet.

24:34.030 --> 24:35.634
Seth!

24:37.600 --> 24:39.887
Hey! I feel like we're trespassing.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.161
This is wrong, guys.

24:41.320 --> 24:42.890
Stop being a buzz kill.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.448
Yeah. Hey, we'll just take a little peek

24:45.600 --> 24:46.601
and then we'll head out.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.442
I mean, come on, you can't
tell me you're not curious.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.364
- Shit.
- Are you okay?

24:51.800 --> 24:52.801
Are you okay?

24:52.960 --> 24:56.089
I ripped my fucking stockings! Cow shit...

24:57.440 --> 24:58.726
It's not funny, dickhead.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.803
- It's a little funny.
- Elise, it's hot.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.041
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.850
- Take you down right here.
- Piss off.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.844
Shh! Get down, fucktards.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.050
We should get a little closer.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.765
Is that the cumball from the shop?

25:15.920 --> 25:18.002
Yeah, that's cumball, all right.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.608
- He had a knife on him.
- My God, I told you.

25:20.760 --> 25:21.966
- We should get closer.
- No.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.161
- Yeah.
- Come on. Come on.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.641
- Let's do it. Let's go.
- All right. All right.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.168
Oh, my God. What are they playing?

25:34.640 --> 25:36.483
Satanic rage.

25:36.680 --> 25:37.886
Oh, my God.

25:39.440 --> 25:43.604
Hey, Satan's children,
are you doing ecstasy?

25:45.000 --> 25:47.924
- Must be a rave.
- Satanic ecstasy.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.201
Can you see in there?

25:53.560 --> 25:54.971
David, I can't see shit.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.849
- Let's go in the back.
- Yeah.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.243
- David!
- All right, all right.

26:20.720 --> 26:21.960
Shit.

26:34.120 --> 26:37.146
Robes. They're wearing fucking robes.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.369
Just when it couldn't get
any more pathetic.

26:49.760 --> 26:53.128
Ladies and gentlemen,
the world's worst Latin class.

26:54.640 --> 26:56.768
No shit, right, what the hell
are they doing?

27:01.160 --> 27:02.446
They're summoning the spirit world.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.244
You see the elemental signs on the wall?

27:05.680 --> 27:07.523
Are they written in blood?

27:07.680 --> 27:10.081
- Magic marker.
- Good one, Dave.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.730
I have my moments.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.291
Oh, nice.

27:20.440 --> 27:22.090
- Very nice.
- Seriously?

27:23.000 --> 27:24.923
Hey, that's the freak from the back room.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.366
And probably the leader, right?

27:26.480 --> 27:27.527
Yeah.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.045
Oh... shit!

27:31.760 --> 27:34.127
Boobs. We have boobies!

27:35.360 --> 27:38.330
Okay. Now I'm starting
to understand the dark powers.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.811
- Seriously?
- Sorry.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.080
Oh, my God. David.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.886
- Elise, what are they doing?
- I don't know.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.849
- David.
- What the hell?

27:51.160 --> 27:52.491
My God, David, they're gonna cut her!

27:52.640 --> 27:55.041
- We have to do something!
- Hey, Chlo, it's cool.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.441
No!

28:04.600 --> 28:05.965
Hey!

28:06.480 --> 28:07.720
Hey, leave her the fuck alone!

28:10.800 --> 28:12.928
- Shit! Go, go, go.
- He's got a gun!

28:13.440 --> 28:15.329
Go, go!

28:15.480 --> 28:16.891
That's it, a fuckin' gun!

28:17.040 --> 28:18.087
Go, go!

28:26.240 --> 28:28.561
Shit, they're shooting at us!
Run! Run, run, run!

28:29.800 --> 28:31.165
Chloe, hurry up. Come on, run!

28:32.160 --> 28:33.571
- Come on, come on.
- Shit!

28:35.600 --> 28:36.965
Get in! Get in!

28:38.040 --> 28:39.166
Go, go, go!

28:56.800 --> 28:58.370
Did they follow us?

28:59.040 --> 29:00.530
No. I think we're okay.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.164
Jesus Christ! What the hell was that?

29:03.320 --> 29:04.970
Grommet, tell me you got that on video.

29:06.920 --> 29:07.967
Oh, fuck.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.924
Fuck! Fuck, I dropped my phone back there.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.445
I dropped my fucking phone!

29:14.480 --> 29:16.084
- Dave, we gotta go back.
- The hell we do.

29:16.240 --> 29:17.605
Yeah, dude. You'll get another one.

29:17.760 --> 29:19.683
Yo, yo, there's some
serious viral on that shit.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.444
They tried to shoot us.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.170
Yeah. Well, we were trespassing.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.805
Are you really
taking their side right now?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.002
No, asshole,
I'm just pointing out the obvious.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.687
If anything, they'll find your fuckin'
phone and report us to the cops.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.531
Good, we can tell the cops about
their sacrificial massacre.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.651
Okay, you guys.
Did anybody see them cut her?

29:35.800 --> 29:38.087
- No, but they were going to.
- How do we know that?

29:38.240 --> 29:39.446
The whole thing could have been for shits.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.726
David, the girl was scared.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.604
I'm not saying that she wasn't.
I'm just pointing out

29:42.800 --> 29:44.962
the fact that we don't know
the whole story.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.525
God.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.525
Shit.

30:23.640 --> 30:24.801
Elise.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.530
Elise, your phone.

30:48.520 --> 30:50.682
- Hello?
- Elise?

30:52.200 --> 30:53.611
No. Who's this?

30:54.080 --> 30:57.050
My name's Alice.
I think I found your phone.

30:58.640 --> 30:59.971
That's her there, right?

31:05.800 --> 31:07.006
Yup.

31:18.840 --> 31:19.921
Morning.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.491
You okay?

31:24.360 --> 31:26.124
There's no one else here.

31:26.680 --> 31:27.761
Just me.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.525
How'd you know to call us?

31:31.760 --> 31:33.364
Elise was the last call.

31:34.400 --> 31:35.606
Is that you?

31:36.280 --> 31:37.441
That's me.

31:46.400 --> 31:47.731
Do you live around here?

31:52.920 --> 31:55.685
- I got it before they did.
- Oh. Cool.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.764
If you want a reward, I can give you...

32:02.920 --> 32:04.251
I want the magic word.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.400
Please.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.287
And video's intact. Thank you.

32:18.760 --> 32:22.287
Um... I'm surprised you didn't delete it.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.611
It wasn't my concern.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.160
So what the fuck was this last night?

32:27.240 --> 32:29.129
Seth, shut up! God.

32:29.800 --> 32:32.326
- We were all there.
- You shouldn't have been.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.404
Fair enough. But it's good we were, right?

32:35.560 --> 32:38.962
Because whatever
fuckin' virginal sacrifice...

32:39.120 --> 32:42.010
- It wasn't a sacrifice.
- Then what was it?

32:45.240 --> 32:46.685
You wouldn't understand.

32:50.520 --> 32:51.646
Try me.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.084
It was an excommunication.

32:54.280 --> 32:55.566
They were kicking you out?

32:56.760 --> 32:57.966
Why?

32:59.520 --> 33:01.090
Because I wouldn't do what they wanted.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.281
See ya.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.284
Wait, Alice. Do you need any money?

33:16.440 --> 33:18.010
- 'Cause I can...
- No! No, no. It's fine.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.764
Well, do you need
a ride anywhere, 'cause...

33:20.920 --> 33:22.001
Chloe.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.968
- I already asked her that.
- It's okay. I'm leaving tomorrow.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.326
Where?

33:28.160 --> 33:29.924
Bakersfield, maybe.

33:30.480 --> 33:31.720
You sure you don't need anything?

33:32.960 --> 33:35.361
Yeah. I'm fine.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.730
Who knew Satanists liked iced cafe mochas?

33:47.920 --> 33:49.410
She never said she was a Satanist.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.325
- No, just a groupie.
- I'm so curious now.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.768
What do you think they wanted her to do?

33:54.920 --> 33:57.571
She's barely legal with no home.
Do the math.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.807
She did have nice titties.

33:58.960 --> 34:01.486
She's all ratchet. Okay?
Girlfriend needs to get a bra.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.927
You guys are just
so fucking nice, aren't you?

34:05.080 --> 34:07.765
She's just a kid,
probably some homeless runaway.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.199
Chlo, we all have our issues.

34:09.400 --> 34:10.731
Oh, fuck you, Seth.

34:10.880 --> 34:13.884
She was cool enough to call and
give your fucking phone back.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.451
She didn't even want money.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.489
Yeah, what she wanted
was a place to crash.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.880
You could read it all over her face.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.041
Well, so?

34:21.239 --> 34:23.368
Would it have been so bad to help her out?

34:23.520 --> 34:24.760
Chloe, for all we know,

34:25.000 --> 34:26.889
she could've been some little crackhead.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.480
Wow!

34:28.639 --> 34:30.005
For so-called "free spirits",

34:30.159 --> 34:31.924
you guys come up really fucking short.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.411
Whatever that was.

34:39.560 --> 34:41.527
Chloe.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.565
I'm sorry. I'm a total bitch.

34:44.719 --> 34:46.051
Megabitch.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.609
Yo, there she is.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.726
David, look, she has nowhere to go.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.210
What? She's waiting for the bus.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.050
She's so not waiting for the bus.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.289
She said she's heading out
tomorrow, and so are we.

35:01.440 --> 35:02.930
It's one night.

35:03.240 --> 35:04.730
The place is a shithole.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.530
Could she really fuck it up any more?

35:07.080 --> 35:08.730
Guess we could at least offer.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.011
All because you goth snobs didn't
want to see Two and a Half Men.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.925
Will you drop it, please?

35:20.760 --> 35:22.967
- Come here, baby.
- Uh-uh.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.648
Alice. Hey.

35:46.440 --> 35:47.930
This is Laney Gore's room.

35:50.600 --> 35:51.840
Yeah.

36:10.480 --> 36:13.211
- What, Laney got naked.
- So fucking full of shit.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.050
No. Laney was totally naked.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.526
No.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.609
She was still in her underwear.

36:25.680 --> 36:28.650
There was blood all over the walls.

36:31.760 --> 36:32.966
Right there.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.082
She tried to make a star with the blood.

36:46.520 --> 36:49.330
- Why?
- She needed a door.

36:52.320 --> 36:55.244
Took a razor and started slicing
through her skin.

36:56.120 --> 36:58.646
Wait. I thought she slit her throat.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.129
That's what most people think.

37:01.640 --> 37:03.722
The truth is, is that she cut her wrists.

37:03.880 --> 37:05.564
Took her almost five minutes,

37:05.760 --> 37:07.569
and then she tried
to bathe in her own blood.

37:08.880 --> 37:11.804
- Why'd she do that?
- She wanted to be worthy.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.211
- She wanted to be welcomed.
- Into hell?

37:18.640 --> 37:20.324
Didn't know it was so hard to get in.

37:20.880 --> 37:22.370
Hell isn't a place.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.927
It's a beautiful confusion.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.604
And there's pain.

37:36.520 --> 37:37.760
Okay, uh...

37:37.920 --> 37:40.526
No offense, but you kinda weren't there.

37:40.680 --> 37:44.410
So... how do you know it took her
five minutes to cut through her wrists?

37:49.040 --> 37:50.451
Jesus.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.844
This is from back when I was 13.

37:57.040 --> 38:00.044
- I was in a bad place.
- A lot of us were.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.931
- Are you Satanic?
- Seth. Jesus fucking Christ.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.043
I don't believe in organizations.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.722
I believe in finding my own path.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.490
That's not what LaVey believed.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.041
LaVey was a fraud.

38:16.280 --> 38:17.566
Most of them are.

38:18.720 --> 38:22.167
I believe in the power
and reward granted unto Him.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.484
Power not of this Earth.

38:29.400 --> 38:30.606
Just like you.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.569
There's a difference.
I believe in the one, true God.

38:36.600 --> 38:37.886
So do I.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.288
I... didn't mean to bring down the party.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.163
No. It's okay. Sucks anyway.

38:50.320 --> 38:52.004
This is what happens
when we let Seth buy the beer.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.367
Yo, El Brazo, God boy.

38:56.440 --> 38:57.566
Aw, dude.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.644
Now it's a party! Now it's a party!

39:00.800 --> 39:03.406
Wet t-shirt, taking it back to '87!

39:06.680 --> 39:08.011
To Laney Gore.

39:08.160 --> 39:09.286
Laney Gore.

39:09.440 --> 39:10.726
And now we chug!

40:02.600 --> 40:03.965
I don't like this.

40:29.280 --> 40:31.521
# It's a crying shame #

40:33.080 --> 40:35.287
# It's a suicide #

40:36.840 --> 40:38.842
# What you do to me #

40:40.760 --> 40:43.001
# Like a .45 #

40:46.560 --> 40:50.610
# When your finger pulls that trigger #

40:50.800 --> 40:52.165
Come dance with me.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.202
# You got me feeling fine #

41:00.120 --> 41:02.327
# When I see you there #

41:03.920 --> 41:06.082
# Standing in the door #

41:07.840 --> 41:09.922
# Makes it perfectly clear #

41:11.560 --> 41:14.564
# What I've been living for #

41:14.720 --> 41:15.881
# Yes indeed #

41:17.120 --> 41:18.884
# Nothing left to say or do #

41:19.080 --> 41:20.445
Seth. What the fuck?

41:20.600 --> 41:21.806
What the fuck?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.480
Hey, what the fuck?

41:24.640 --> 41:26.130
# You got me feeling fine #

41:28.280 --> 41:30.647
# Got me feeling fine #

41:30.840 --> 41:32.842
# Hey, yeah #

41:33.000 --> 41:36.766
# Red lips, fingertips #

41:36.920 --> 41:39.321
# A velvet glove that always fits #

41:39.480 --> 41:40.981
No!

41:47.760 --> 41:48.841
I can feel her.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.086
I feel Laney.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.206
We tried to summon her.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.841
- We used this.
- She's beyond that.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.406
We can reach her.

42:07.560 --> 42:08.800
I can show you how.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.606
What do you mean?

42:11.760 --> 42:13.285
She means she can summon. Right?

42:14.280 --> 42:15.770
I can do a lot of things.

42:17.520 --> 42:19.522
I just need willing others to help me.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.361
We're willing.

42:24.640 --> 42:27.450
- No, we're not.
- Chlo, come on.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.450
Don't you want to know where she went?

42:32.800 --> 42:35.406
- She's dead.
- There's no death.

42:36.560 --> 42:39.564
Just transition. I can show you.

42:40.920 --> 42:42.081
Take my hand.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.966
No. This we don't record.

42:55.440 --> 42:56.680
All are welcome.

43:13.120 --> 43:15.009
Laney wants to show us something.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.325
Something beautiful.

43:21.040 --> 43:22.371
Chloe.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.647
And these four be here with me.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.485
And now we travel from flame to flame.

44:00.680 --> 44:01.806
I see it.

44:05.320 --> 44:06.526
I want to share.

44:08.080 --> 44:10.128
No, they are not like the others.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.765
They're of the humble.

44:15.520 --> 44:16.681
They want to.

44:41.560 --> 44:42.721
- Oh. Hey!
- Shit.

44:47.440 --> 44:48.487
What the...

44:54.960 --> 44:57.122
- Yo, what are you doing?
- David, shut up.

44:57.280 --> 44:59.123
Don't tell me to shut up,
she's fuckin' up the walls.

45:14.600 --> 45:15.726
Awesome.

45:48.200 --> 45:50.931
- Alice, are you okay?
- She's drunk.

45:52.280 --> 45:55.762
- Oh, shit.
- Oh! Oh, shit!

45:55.920 --> 45:58.571
- Chloe, she's just drunk.
- She only had one beer, Dave.

45:58.720 --> 45:59.881
Can you please get her some water?

46:00.840 --> 46:02.444
- Hey...
- Don't you see?

46:05.880 --> 46:07.370
She found the door.

46:09.920 --> 46:11.126
Laney's with him.

46:13.680 --> 46:14.920
All are welcome.

46:18.760 --> 46:20.091
Oh, my God.

46:23.440 --> 46:24.851
It's beautiful.

46:30.240 --> 46:31.446
Whoa! Hey!

46:43.480 --> 46:44.606
It's beautiful.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.851
Oh, my God. David.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.570
- Oh, fuck.
- Fuck.

46:54.200 --> 46:55.406
It's okay.

46:56.440 --> 46:57.965
We all made the choice.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.604
We're joined now in the circle.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.969
Yeah, the fuck we did. Out.

47:04.720 --> 47:06.404
Don't you see? He wants us.

47:07.200 --> 47:08.247
Just like Laney.

47:10.880 --> 47:12.120
We'll all be summoned.

47:13.320 --> 47:14.367
And I'm the first.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.809
I'll guide us through the darkness.

47:19.440 --> 47:20.441
Through the labyrinth.

47:21.680 --> 47:23.091
Alice, you need to leave.

47:24.160 --> 47:25.400
I know.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.805
I'll see you soon.

49:20.760 --> 49:23.764
Yeah. Yeah, no, I...
I really appreciate that, Jay.

49:25.280 --> 49:28.648
No, no, no. We just, uh...
we just got off to a late start.

49:28.800 --> 49:29.847
Be an extra day.

49:32.080 --> 49:33.445
Yeah. Yeah.

49:39.920 --> 49:41.046
Okay.

49:42.040 --> 49:44.042
Yeah, no, it's perfect. It's perfect.

49:46.600 --> 49:47.601
All right, cool.

49:47.760 --> 49:49.728
We should have never
brought her in, I swear to God.

49:50.640 --> 49:52.483
They said if all checks out,
we'll be cleared in two days.

49:52.640 --> 49:55.007
I don't wanna wait two days.
We should have never picked her up.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.161
We should have never...

49:56.320 --> 49:57.924
All right, Elise,
you made your fucking point!

50:01.080 --> 50:02.844
All right, I talked to my cousin.

50:03.240 --> 50:04.844
We can crash at his place
in the Palisades.

50:05.040 --> 50:06.166
There's a key under the mat.

50:06.840 --> 50:09.127
- Where's the Palisades?
- The fuck if I know.

50:09.280 --> 50:10.406
I want to leave.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.210
Elise, we don't have a choice right now.

50:12.400 --> 50:14.402
- Says who?
- Says the LAPD.

50:15.360 --> 50:18.045
All right? It's either the
Palisades or the Scooby van.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.001
Um...

51:04.600 --> 51:06.011
Where's the bathroom?

51:06.560 --> 51:08.528
It's, uh, last door on the left.

51:30.978 --> 51:32.009
Elise.

51:35.840 --> 51:37.205
Oh, God.

52:05.760 --> 52:07.091
How long you really think we'll be here?

52:08.720 --> 52:10.131
Who the hell knows?

52:10.560 --> 52:13.644
I mean, they still have to interview
everyone from that goddamn house, too.

52:19.710 --> 52:21.439
This is so fucked.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.001
Whole lotta fucked.

53:14.360 --> 53:15.521
Elise?

53:21.000 --> 53:22.206
Elise?

53:25.400 --> 53:26.731
Elise?

53:33.280 --> 53:34.611
Elise, are you okay?

53:45.560 --> 53:46.800
Elise?

54:03.320 --> 54:07.405
Chlo. Chlo. Chloe, hey.
Hey. Hey. Hey. You're okay.

54:07.560 --> 54:11.360
You're okay. You're okay. You're okay.

55:05.360 --> 55:06.521
Police?

55:06.920 --> 55:08.001
No, my mom.

55:09.440 --> 55:10.566
Hey.

55:11.920 --> 55:14.002
No, we're still in LA. Just...

55:14.400 --> 55:16.482
No, just decided to stay another day.

55:17.240 --> 55:20.608
No, no. It's fine. Don't worry.

55:21.520 --> 55:22.601
I don't know yet.

55:23.720 --> 55:24.801
Yes. We will.

55:25.600 --> 55:27.090
Yes, I promise.

55:36.640 --> 55:38.210
Did you tell her what happened?

55:40.960 --> 55:42.803
I still don't even know what happened.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.565
Offerings.

55:55.200 --> 55:58.329
She said she would be the first,
and the rest would be summoned.

56:01.080 --> 56:02.969
We all made the choice
and grabbed her hand.

56:03.120 --> 56:05.282
Chloe, she didn't know
what she was saying.

56:11.240 --> 56:12.287
Look.

56:12.960 --> 56:14.644
A couple of days and we're out of here.

56:15.960 --> 56:17.564
All right? We'll forget this.

56:21.120 --> 56:22.281
Forget this?

56:28.160 --> 56:30.003
How do you erase that
from your fucking mind?

56:30.160 --> 56:32.811
- Chloe.
- She slit her own throat!

56:35.840 --> 56:37.330
She died right in front of us.

56:37.480 --> 56:39.801
Yeah, Chloe, I know. I was there, too.

56:46.880 --> 56:48.041
Look.

56:49.960 --> 56:51.564
Another day, and we'll be on the road.

56:53.080 --> 56:54.206
All right?

56:54.360 --> 56:56.966
Might even make the last night
of Coachella, God willing.

57:02.120 --> 57:03.201
Chloe.

57:50.720 --> 57:52.006
Elise, forget it.

57:54.040 --> 57:55.724
No. I want to know why she did it.

57:58.760 --> 58:00.364
I want to know where she is.

58:00.680 --> 58:02.364
She's not gonna tell you, she's dead.

58:07.520 --> 58:08.806
I wanna know.

58:12.360 --> 58:13.600
Come here.

58:20.640 --> 58:22.005
Oh, that's cute!

58:30.040 --> 58:31.041
David?

58:32.060 --> 58:33.869
David?

58:35.480 --> 58:37.721
Really? Who's the asshole?

58:37.880 --> 58:39.848
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck, my ass.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.570
What the hell is your problem, Seth?

58:41.720 --> 58:43.609
- I didn't do this.
- You're such an asshole.

58:43.760 --> 58:46.366
- It's not funny, Seth.
- Fuck you. I didn't do shit!

58:46.520 --> 58:47.681
Dave was the one in here, not me!

58:47.840 --> 58:49.251
Dude, don't even try that shit with me.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.091
What the fuck?

59:50.960 --> 59:52.291
Motherfuckers!

59:52.880 --> 59:54.041
David, no.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.726
What is this?

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.086
We don't even know if it was them.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.844
Yeah? Who the hell else would it be?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.047
Sick pieces of shit.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.201
Let's just call the police.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.640
David, let's call the police!

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.723
- I don't feel well.
- Shit.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.167
- Hey!
- I don't feel well.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.321
- Hey!
- David, stop!

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.891
They're not even open!

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.521
Fuckers!

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.446
Yo, there he is.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.801
Hey!

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.162
- Shit.
- David!

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.768
Fuck! Jesus.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.530
What? You want this?

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.125
David, no!

01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:15.564
You think this shit is funny?
Breaking into my place?

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.245
Fuck you, man, I don't even know
where you live!

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.441
Bullshit!

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.329
- Fucker! Hit him again.
- David, no!

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.050
I repeat, why'd you break into my place?

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.321
I didn't.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.686
What'd you do to that girl, man?

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.841
- What?
- Alice!

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.570
- What'd you do to her?
- Nothing.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.247
Nothing? She just slit her throat in our
hotel room for no apparent fuckin' reason.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.447
She said you made her do things.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.568
Is that why you kicked her out
of your little bullshit cult?

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.200
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, man!

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.611
You got rid of her because
she wouldn't go along

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.451
- with your twisted shit!
- We wouldn't go along with hers, man!

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.366
We kicked her out
because she was too hardcore.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.811
Even for us.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.082
You broke my fuckin' nose, man!

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:05.444
What the hell's gotten into you?

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.846
What? The fucker tried to slash me.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.365
So you break his nose?

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.806
You should've put it through his brain.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:12.641
Goddamn it, we're already in enough
trouble, we don't need any more!

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.404
- Chlo, don't get my fucking...
- Seth, shut up!

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.124
What is happening?

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.884
Fuck! Chloe!

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.361
Chloe. What is going on?

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.769
Can we get out of here please?
I don't really feel well.

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.764
I just want to get the fuck out of here.

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.644
Can we get the fuck out
of here please? I feel sick.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.125
Okay. Hey, does anyone understand that
we are part of a police investigation?

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.970
We can't leave town.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.970
I wanna go. Can we go?

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.685
- Yeah, we can.
- Jesus!

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.649
- We can.
- No, we can't.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.165
Okay, the police say we can't go anywhere.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.646
I don't care what they said.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:01.205
Something happened in that hotel room
and it's still fucking happening right now.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.250
It's like we're marked or something.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.004
You feel it. I know you do.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:07.730
- I feel it.
- Come on.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.121
- No. We have to leave.
- It just hurts a little bit.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.406
Fucking look at her.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.290
We can call the cops
in Boulder if you want.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.491
Let's just grab our things and go.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.201
Right now.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.846
Jesus Christ.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.161
Come on.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.321
Fine.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.085
- David, I'm gonna be sick.
- Hey, it's okay.

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.651
It's not okay, I'm gonna...

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.530
David, we need to pull off somewhere.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.681
All right.

01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:34.011
Shit.

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.610
Do we even know where we're going?

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:06.361
I don't see a gas station.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.449
- What about up here?
- Chloe, there's nothing!

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.888
Oh, shit. Dave, pull over.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.883
- What?
- No, you gotta pull over now.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.883
Damn it.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.724
- Now! Pull over now.
- All right.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.386
Hey.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.769
Elise!

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.082
Are you okay, Elise? Are you okay?

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.241
Oh, my God, you're freezing.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.402
I feel hot. I need to get to the bathroom.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.403
No, no, no. We'll find you
somewhere else...

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.347
No, I don't want to go
anywhere else. Can you...

01:06:44.447 --> 01:06:45.907
Are you okay?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.081
- What?
- It hurts.

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.924
Oh, my God.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.081
It hurts!

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.208
Chlo, is she okay?

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:58.090
Uh... Yeah. It's okay. I'm right here.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.851
- We need to get her to a hospital.
- What's wrong?

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.161
- I don't know.
- What?

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.560
Seth, stop.
Just give her a minute... Seth!

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.449
No.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.247
Elise! Elise, it's me.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.966
What?

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.120
Where is she?

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.767
Where?

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.649
I don't know.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.130
Seth, will you help me?

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.526
- Elise!
- Seth.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.641
Calling 911. I need to call 911.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.089
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.810
911, what is your emergency?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.047
Hi...

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.004
My friend's in trouble. She's missing.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.288
We need your help please!

01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.967
Hello?

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.806
Where are you, again?

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.531
We are... We are... Just...
David, where the fuck are we?

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.040
Santa Fe in South Los Angeles.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.282
We're at Santa Fe in South Los Angeles.

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.245
Please, my friend, she's in trouble.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.686
Please. We need your...

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.521
Hello?

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.323
Hello? Operator!

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.450
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.328
I don't know. I have no bars.
There's no signal.

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:24.361
Hey!

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:27.961
Hey!

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.287
Elise!

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.366
Seth!

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.200
Elise!

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.122
I'm on the third floor,
I don't see her. Elise!

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.251
- Elise!
- Okay, just...

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:24.129
Just stay where you are.
We're coming, okay?

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.005
Elise!

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.205
Come on. Come on.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.600
- Seth!
- Elise!

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:42.566
Shit. It's closed off.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.447
- Over here...
- Guys! Where are you?

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:47.166
Please!

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.087
Seth!

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:51.281
Seth!

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.527
Wait, wait. I hear her.

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:59.649
Oh, God. Sounds like she's in pain. Elise!

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.726
Wait.

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.050
Yo, guys!

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.402
- Seth, wait for us.
- I'm coming!

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.207
# It's a crying shame #

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.001
# It's a suicide #

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.647
# What you do to me #

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:31.528
# Like a .45 #

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.323
# With your finger, pull that trigger #

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.050
# Looks like mine #

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.165
# You got me feeling fine #

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.167
Sorry.

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.323
Chloe! Help me!

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.604
Chloe!

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.641
Is that you?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.001
Seth!

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:12.560
Seth, Seth.

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.611
Seth, are you there?

01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:16.607
Shit.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.922
Help! I'm burning!

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.326
Oh fuck!

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:22.482
I'm fucking burning!

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.441
Seth!

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.931
Seth!

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.481
Oh, my God.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.087
David.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.368
David, David, your face.

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.721
Oh, my God.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.041
Shit.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.810
No. No. We need to get out of here.

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.850
David, we need to
get out of here right now.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.201
We need to go.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.647
We need to go. Come on. Come on, David!

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.290
Dav... David?

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.730
David!

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.920
Chloe!

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.571
Help me!

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.321
Stop.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.724
- Chloe.
- David!

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.164
Chloe, I'm right here. Chloe.

01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:09.086
- Chloe.
- Come find me.

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.846
Please.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.401
Laney wants to show us something.

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.290
Something beautiful.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.122
Follow me.

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.846
Chloe.

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.046
Can you help me?

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.360
Help!

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.122
Help me, please! Somebody!

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.084
Please help!

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.611
Help!

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.285
Please, someone come...

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.567
Don't stay! Leave!

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:37.845
Stop! Don't! Go!

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.204
Please leave town right now! Don't go!

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:45.160
Don't! Don't bring it back!
Please! Please!

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.642
No. No! No!

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.485
Hell isn't a place.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.041
It's a beautiful confusion.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.206
And there's pain.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.811
Oh, my God.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.800
Don't you see him?

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.402
Chloe.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.046
No!

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.040
It's me.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.529
You're already dead.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.005
You fucking...

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.086
Don't be afraid.

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.040
- Always been here.
- He's already here.

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.201
You died.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.971
You're dead.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:44.726
Oh, my...

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.047
We're all dead.

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:51.444
Oh, my God. Oh, God, please no.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.681
Forever.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.726
No!

01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.565
No!

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.170
What the fuck?

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:13.608
Oh, God, please.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.411
Please, God!

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.921
No!

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.241
We're dead.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:34.961
David!

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:40.569
David. David.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.961
No.

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.805
No!

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:56.887
Oh, my God, make it stop.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.162
Make it stop. Make it stop.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.967
Make it stop.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:04.926
Come with us.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.601
