WEBVTT

00:12.186 --> 00:13.678
I am in love.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.300
Dude! That's the mailman.

00:16.639 --> 00:17.639
Mailwoman.

00:17.768 --> 00:18.878
All woman.

00:19.111 --> 00:21.479
Are you going to shoot
something or just keep staring?

00:29.583 --> 00:31.399
- Come on, dude. Hurry up!
- Hold up.

00:31.441 --> 00:32.441
I'm coming!

00:37.075 --> 00:39.462
That's 95 pitches so far for Dryer...

00:40.176 --> 00:42.142
- You seeing this?
- My shot.

00:42.262 --> 00:43.262
Okay.

00:43.811 --> 00:44.879
Come on.

00:48.941 --> 00:50.362
He steps in.

00:51.439 --> 00:52.515
Dryer...

00:52.562 --> 00:55.022
He makes the sign. There's the windup...

00:55.140 --> 00:56.187
and the pitch...

00:56.651 --> 00:58.711
And there it is! A shot up the middle!

00:58.837 --> 01:02.220
Singleterry puts one in the
gap to left center field!

01:02.453 --> 01:05.459
One run's gonna score!
Two runs are gonna score!

01:05.889 --> 01:09.889
Singleterry flies in head
first... and he is safe!

01:40.753 --> 01:43.836
I was proud to call Special
Agent Decker my friend.

01:43.874 --> 01:45.299
Even after his retirement,

01:45.359 --> 01:47.935
I knew that he was never
more than a phone call away.

01:48.568 --> 01:50.937
My heart goes out to his family

01:51.057 --> 01:53.301
and his beloved girlfriend Sasha.

01:54.836 --> 01:57.747
I know that William loved her very much.

01:58.034 --> 02:01.343
- I'm sure he did.
- We're at funeral, and she's 22.

02:01.836 --> 02:03.536
- Yeah.
- Is that why we're here?

02:03.589 --> 02:05.345
So you can Google the girls?

02:05.465 --> 02:08.232
"Ogle." And no, we're here
to accompany the director.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.360
I, for one, am glad
she's back from vacation.

02:10.562 --> 02:13.328
Decker died of a heart attack,
not in the line of duty.

02:13.519 --> 02:15.604
I hardly think her
presence is necessary.

02:15.663 --> 02:17.513
NCIS Code of Conduct,

02:17.750 --> 02:19.904
Paragraph One, Sub-section B.

02:20.176 --> 02:23.291
"Any interstate travel
made by the NCIS director,

02:23.437 --> 02:25.071
must be accompanied by..."

02:25.422 --> 02:26.679
You're making this up.

02:27.016 --> 02:28.189
Yes. But...

02:28.459 --> 02:31.802
she always is accompanied by two
senior agents for security purposes.

02:31.844 --> 02:33.708
And if it's not a rule,
it really should be.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.545
Sorry. What was that name again?

02:35.585 --> 02:38.090
Mr. Oshimaida.

02:38.599 --> 02:40.002
First name?

02:40.260 --> 02:41.935
There are more than one?

02:42.264 --> 02:45.824
No, sir, in fact, there's
nobody here by that name.

02:45.912 --> 02:46.912
Check again.

02:47.206 --> 02:50.848
Sorry, sir. I've checked the registry
twice. There is no Mr. Oshimaida.

02:51.535 --> 02:54.006
But if you'd like to leave
your name, perhaps, I can...

03:16.859 --> 03:18.490
Director, are you ready to go?

03:18.847 --> 03:20.298
No, actually, I'm not.

03:20.466 --> 03:22.409
No rush. You know, we'll just hang out.

03:22.554 --> 03:24.103
No need to wait for me. In fact,

03:24.234 --> 03:26.584
we are not due to fly
out until tomorrow.

03:26.624 --> 03:29.109
- So why don't the two of you...
- Yes, sure.

03:29.158 --> 03:31.145
Take the rest of the trip off.

03:31.943 --> 03:32.990
Right, sure.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.049
So you want us to
call you a taxi, or...?

03:35.442 --> 03:37.138
You want the car. Of course.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.609
'Cause, we'll-we'll
figure something out.

03:40.126 --> 03:41.899
Thanks. All right, drive safe.

03:42.025 --> 03:43.725
That L.A. traffic's a little weird.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.391
L.A. baby!

03:46.865 --> 03:49.260
Sorry, Ziva. I'm going
to have to cut you loose.

03:50.476 --> 03:51.476
Hey! Wait up!

04:01.892 --> 04:03.536
- Good morning.
- McGee.

04:04.198 --> 04:05.274
Timothy.

04:06.709 --> 04:07.806
Haircut, McGee?

04:08.320 --> 04:09.125
No.

04:09.230 --> 04:13.188
I believe it was a
suggestion, not an observation.

04:17.478 --> 04:19.697
Is something going on downstairs?

04:25.653 --> 04:27.014
Is something wrong, McGee?

04:27.288 --> 04:29.423
- Yeah, what are you guys...
- Doing upstairs?

04:29.574 --> 04:30.768
Random bug sweep.

04:30.881 --> 04:33.352
Off-limits to all
non-security personnel.

04:33.478 --> 04:35.128
Didn't Jethro tell you?

04:35.911 --> 04:38.754
Or perhaps his cranium
trauma is acting...

04:39.247 --> 04:40.776
He's behind me, isn't he?

04:41.005 --> 04:42.345
Good morning, Jethro!

04:42.682 --> 04:44.064
- Doc.
- Gibbs.

04:45.493 --> 04:47.523
Got something for me?

04:47.643 --> 04:49.693
Just arrived from Major Fornell.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.685
Mysterious.

04:58.878 --> 04:59.878
Yeah.

05:02.439 --> 05:05.120
Yes. Well, the security boys
should be finished by now.

05:05.225 --> 05:07.026
Thanks for the hospitality...

05:07.299 --> 05:08.299
probie.

05:10.663 --> 05:12.758
Currently, it's 78 degrees in Hollywood,

05:12.790 --> 05:16.093
82 degrees in the Valley
and 73 at the beach.

05:16.159 --> 05:18.253
All in all, a great looking
couple of days in L.A.

05:18.295 --> 05:20.955
Warm days, cool nights,
and very low humidity...

05:25.437 --> 05:27.399
I take it the Ritz was booked.

05:30.022 --> 05:31.022
Ice.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.268
Better be a damn good reason

05:33.388 --> 05:36.259
you had me jump on the
earliest flight out of Mexico.

05:36.490 --> 05:39.550
You ever work with Special
Agent William Decker?

05:41.004 --> 05:43.170
He hired on the year I retired.

05:44.551 --> 05:46.830
Why? He's in some kind of trouble?

05:47.975 --> 05:48.975
He's dead.

05:51.106 --> 05:52.161
And I'm next.

06:00.790 --> 06:02.117
I need your help.

06:03.638 --> 06:04.727
My help?

06:04.783 --> 06:06.170
You are the director

06:06.412 --> 06:08.447
of an armed federal agency.

06:08.915 --> 06:10.722
This has to be outside the agency,

06:10.868 --> 06:13.657
and I need someone I can trust,
and you're on the short list.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.470
I didn't know you were a fan.

06:16.842 --> 06:18.554
Gibbs' short list.

06:18.856 --> 06:21.238
He trusts you with his life
and that's good enough for me.

06:22.647 --> 06:23.647
Let's hear it.

06:25.305 --> 06:28.886
Ten years ago, I spent time
in Europe with another agent.

06:29.087 --> 06:31.223
I take it you two weren't sightseeing.

06:31.367 --> 06:32.506
We were...

06:32.816 --> 06:35.993
but the sights we were looking
for weren't on any tourist map.

06:36.902 --> 06:37.999
The op?

06:40.505 --> 06:41.505
Classified.

06:42.984 --> 06:44.345
Nice chatting with you.

06:45.224 --> 06:46.847
Enjoy the free cable.

06:47.236 --> 06:50.629
We were trying to infiltrate
a Russian spy ring.

06:51.947 --> 06:55.193
Special Agent Decker
was our contact agent.

06:55.369 --> 06:57.745
He got us our identities,
handled communications...

06:57.786 --> 06:59.042
I know the drill.

07:01.806 --> 07:04.740
The name Oshimaida
was a code word we were

07:04.781 --> 07:07.755
to use in the event our
cover was compromised.

07:08.391 --> 07:09.438
And was it?

07:09.665 --> 07:11.571
We thought we got out clean.

07:12.059 --> 07:13.986
But today at Decker's funeral,

07:14.237 --> 07:15.748
a man asked

07:16.152 --> 07:17.798
for Mr. Oshimaida.

07:18.592 --> 07:19.592
Coincidence.

07:20.518 --> 07:22.758
Only three of us knew that name.

07:23.265 --> 07:25.083
Whoever he was,

07:25.204 --> 07:26.816
he heard that name from Decker.

07:27.044 --> 07:30.563
And Decker only would have used it if
he thought he was about to be killed.

07:35.018 --> 07:37.678
You said he died of a heart attack.

07:37.955 --> 07:40.489
The coroner said he
died of a heart attack.

07:40.747 --> 07:42.778
Decker was trying to get me a message.

07:43.154 --> 07:44.154
You're next?

07:44.951 --> 07:46.801
My partner's in danger too.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.777
Whoever he is,

07:50.120 --> 07:52.316
he believes one of us is Oshimaida.

07:53.994 --> 07:55.434
Who's the other agent?

07:58.489 --> 08:01.882
The next time I head for that
door, it won't be for show.

08:04.045 --> 08:05.045
Gibbs.

08:08.167 --> 08:09.528
Where do I sign up?

08:49.496 --> 08:52.093
Five shots of the back of
his head, none of his face,

08:52.239 --> 08:53.873
and one of the woman driver.

08:54.141 --> 08:57.226
She's a great director.
Annie Leibovitz she's not.

08:59.192 --> 09:00.323
Any ideas?

09:00.954 --> 09:04.232
No, I know. But I can't ask
McGee because the director

09:04.376 --> 09:06.240
specifically said to
keep this on the DL.

09:06.509 --> 09:08.335
- Keep what on the DL?
- Nothing.

09:13.529 --> 09:14.529
You told them.

09:14.875 --> 09:15.880
McGee...

09:16.411 --> 09:17.550
They're not real.

09:17.603 --> 09:19.259
They're just keeping me company

09:19.339 --> 09:20.968
while Tony and Ziva are in L.A.

09:21.097 --> 09:22.097
Okay.

09:23.242 --> 09:24.855
Guess you don't need my help.

09:26.151 --> 09:27.151
Wait.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.565
I do need your help.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.941
- But you have to keep it a secret.
- My lips are sealed.

09:37.095 --> 09:38.095
Okay.

09:38.663 --> 09:41.799
The director sent me these pictures.
She needs an ID on the John Doe.

09:41.841 --> 09:43.621
Does Gibbs know about this?

09:43.885 --> 09:46.518
I asked her, she said no.
She didn't say any more.

09:46.772 --> 09:49.675
- I didn't push.
- Did you try blowing up the photos?

09:50.398 --> 09:51.395
How about...

09:51.419 --> 09:54.174
The reflections on the side of the
car? That's a great idea, McGee.

09:54.216 --> 09:55.787
I had it like two hours ago.

09:56.852 --> 09:59.128
- Did you have any luck with the driver?
- A woman.

09:59.165 --> 10:01.280
Could be blonde, brunette. I don't know.

10:07.316 --> 10:09.494
The EX-IF data on the cell phone.

10:09.612 --> 10:12.146
It should tell us the exact time
the director took the picture.

10:12.219 --> 10:14.793
McGee, tell me something that
cardboard Tony doesn't know.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.497
No, Abby, look.

10:18.393 --> 10:21.694
He's making a call. If we know
what time the call was placed,

10:22.661 --> 10:24.764
we can ping all the cell
towers in the area...

10:24.837 --> 10:26.701
And we can lift his cell phone number.

10:26.943 --> 10:28.147
That's genius, McGee.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.141
You're googling... again.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.503
A book. How McGee-ish of you.

10:47.197 --> 10:48.995
- You're in my sun.
- You'll thank me later.

10:49.019 --> 10:50.066
Come on. Let's go.

10:50.114 --> 10:52.167
If you value that hand, I suggest

10:52.337 --> 10:54.344
you back away slowly.

10:56.311 --> 10:58.932
- I'm not going anywhere.
- The director gave us the day off.

10:59.094 --> 11:01.433
Yes, and she can just as
easily change her mind.

11:01.553 --> 11:03.905
We need to stay close to
home base, just in case.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.295
We have cell phones, Ziva.

11:05.327 --> 11:07.765
If she needs to get in touch
with us, she'll call us.

11:08.329 --> 11:09.776
What do you have in mind?

11:11.123 --> 11:14.823
A cruise down Sunset Boulevard, Against
All Odds, Jeff Bridges, Jimmy Woods.

11:15.171 --> 11:16.658
You do not have a car, Tony.

11:25.140 --> 11:27.033
Zero to 60 in 5.2 seconds.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.700
First movie quote I hear, I'm driving.

11:30.820 --> 11:31.980
Pay the guy.

11:33.577 --> 11:35.126
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:47.227 --> 11:48.546
Gibbs teach you that?

11:48.666 --> 11:49.857
Gibbs doesn't teach.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.527
You watch, you learn.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.525
You learn. I taught.

12:04.471 --> 12:06.503
We're talking a risk coming here.

12:06.945 --> 12:08.767
Local Leos may have missed something.

12:09.321 --> 12:12.069
I doubt Decker's killer
left behind a calling card.

12:12.197 --> 12:14.648
If he was here, he
left something behind.

12:17.968 --> 12:19.204
Or Decker did.

12:21.114 --> 12:22.253
He was a pro.

12:22.891 --> 12:23.927
Yeah.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.974
Got a little careless in his retirement.

12:49.134 --> 12:50.300
Sasha.

12:50.671 --> 12:52.331
Sasha, we're not going to hurt you.

12:52.457 --> 12:54.151
How do you know my name?

12:56.121 --> 12:57.339
You were at the funeral.

12:57.499 --> 12:58.499
That's right.

12:58.618 --> 13:00.768
I was an old friend of William's.

13:03.055 --> 13:04.599
We're here to help.

13:04.732 --> 13:06.663
- Help with what?
- Sasha...

13:06.904 --> 13:09.755
we don't think William's death was...

13:10.490 --> 13:11.490
natural.

13:14.645 --> 13:16.396
And I'm guessing you don't either.

13:19.905 --> 13:22.475
If there's something
you need to tell me...

13:23.768 --> 13:26.072
William never said anything specific.

13:26.557 --> 13:29.552
Just that if anything
was to ever happen to him,

13:29.911 --> 13:31.852
that I was to deliver a message.

13:32.128 --> 13:33.128
To who?

13:41.034 --> 13:43.442
"Jenny Shepard, Director, NCIS."

13:44.858 --> 13:45.858
You know her?

13:45.978 --> 13:47.033
Unfortunately.

13:49.415 --> 13:50.839
We'll deliver the message.

13:53.279 --> 13:56.461
William wanted me to tell her
that he had some sort of...

13:56.977 --> 13:58.422
insurance policy.

13:58.529 --> 14:00.429
- I think he called it.
- Where?

14:00.603 --> 14:02.402
In his place out in the desert.

14:03.493 --> 14:04.834
An old diner.

14:05.062 --> 14:07.700
He was going to start
fixing it up next month.

14:08.964 --> 14:11.016
He said Jenny would know where to look.

14:12.916 --> 14:14.110
This the address?

14:14.501 --> 14:15.501
Yeah.

14:16.041 --> 14:17.041
Sasha.

14:17.828 --> 14:20.114
- Do you have family?
- Not in L.A.

14:20.429 --> 14:22.241
- In Nevada.
- Good.

14:22.864 --> 14:24.484
Go there. Now.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.444
I don't have a car.

14:26.607 --> 14:28.123
Take my rental.

14:29.789 --> 14:31.856
You should do what the lady says.

14:31.976 --> 14:32.976
Okay.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.274
Forget your name?

14:42.454 --> 14:44.148
It's better she doesn't know.

14:44.268 --> 14:45.268
Better for who?

14:47.770 --> 14:50.555
So when we find who did this...

14:50.681 --> 14:52.649
It'll be just the way you like it.

14:54.072 --> 14:56.083
No paperwork.

15:16.265 --> 15:18.979
You wanted the authentic
L.A. experience.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.634
I'm giving it to you.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.216
I wanted to read my book.

15:22.385 --> 15:24.784
- They have books in D.C.
- They have traffic as well.

15:30.328 --> 15:32.152
I do not like this. Something feels off.

15:32.188 --> 15:33.632
Yeah, it's the transmission.

15:33.678 --> 15:35.132
No, it's about the director.

15:35.263 --> 15:36.909
Tony, we are her escorts.

15:37.014 --> 15:38.729
We're supposed to be escorting.

15:38.843 --> 15:40.561
Maybe she found a new escort.

15:40.814 --> 15:44.164
The director is a flesh-and-blood
woman with flesh-and-blood needs.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.433
If you want to call and ruin
her private party, be my guest.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.917
You couldn't have
gotten a car with SatNav?

15:51.178 --> 15:52.226
Sat what?

15:52.729 --> 15:53.972
Never mind.

15:59.385 --> 16:01.144
Yes, Agent DiNozzo?

16:01.397 --> 16:04.519
Hi, Director. How's everything
going? How's the paperwork?

16:04.554 --> 16:06.205
Slow. Too many interruptions.

16:06.325 --> 16:09.181
Well, it's a beautiful
day to be stuck inside.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.019
You need something, Agent DiNozzo?

16:11.194 --> 16:14.091
No, just checking in
with our fearless leader.

16:14.188 --> 16:16.328
- Got it.
- What'd I tell you, Tony?

16:16.638 --> 16:18.958
- Not to call you our fearless leader.
- And?

16:19.556 --> 16:20.941
To take the day off.

16:20.985 --> 16:23.064
Enjoy your time in L.A.,
because, believe me,

16:23.106 --> 16:25.096
I can always find
something for you to do.

16:26.967 --> 16:29.355
- Paperwork had a deep voice.
- She is with a man.

16:29.441 --> 16:31.255
Does not mean she is sleeping with him.

16:31.380 --> 16:34.082
You're right. I'm sure they're
tag-teaming the paperwork.

16:34.218 --> 16:35.767
She's hiding something from us.

16:36.382 --> 16:38.698
Yes, it's called a sex life.

16:38.838 --> 16:41.348
Maybe if you had one, you'd
be a little more understanding.

16:44.348 --> 16:46.757
I could tell you stories.

16:47.823 --> 16:49.255
Tell. Slowly.

16:49.883 --> 16:50.883
All right.

16:51.066 --> 16:53.796
But first, you have
to do me one small...

16:54.028 --> 16:55.028
favor.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.314
Name it.

16:56.356 --> 16:58.317
Call the Los Angeles Police Department,

16:58.350 --> 17:00.350
tell them you are conducting
a local investigation,

17:00.381 --> 17:03.732
and ask them to track down the GPS
coordinates of the director's rental.

17:03.983 --> 17:04.983
That's all?

17:05.085 --> 17:07.492
It will make me very
happy to know where she is.

17:08.815 --> 17:10.319
It'll be like Chinatown.

17:10.440 --> 17:12.626
I will even let you do your Jack.

17:13.123 --> 17:15.715
Well, how do you like them apples?

17:18.114 --> 17:19.527
McGee, what are you doing?!

17:19.861 --> 17:22.731
Pinging all the cell towers near
the Hollywood Forever Cemetery,

17:22.801 --> 17:24.540
scanning for the director's mystery man.

17:24.605 --> 17:26.358
No, what are you doing to my Tony?

17:26.478 --> 17:27.588
I'm improving him.

17:28.661 --> 17:29.661
Actually...

17:30.128 --> 17:31.825
I do like a man with a little scruff.

17:35.214 --> 17:36.353
Got a hit.

17:37.084 --> 17:40.330
Ten calls were in progress when
the director snapped that photo.

17:40.582 --> 17:43.597
Triangulating with the nearest
cell tower for locations.

17:43.850 --> 17:46.043
Hollywood Forever Cemetery is here.

17:46.703 --> 17:48.588
"Viggo Drantyev."

17:49.184 --> 17:50.900
Running his background.

17:51.997 --> 17:55.030
Nothing in the domestic
database. Checking international.

17:57.053 --> 17:58.053
Got him.

17:58.862 --> 18:00.679
McGee, are you seeing this?

18:00.799 --> 18:03.252
What exactly did the director
say this was for again?

18:04.202 --> 18:05.291
She didn't.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.284
It's the director.

18:09.693 --> 18:10.845
Good luck with that.

18:10.955 --> 18:13.049
No, you wanted in, McGee. You're in.

18:13.482 --> 18:15.849
Just... just be quiet.

18:16.090 --> 18:18.435
Forensic Specialist
extraordinary, Abby Sciuto.

18:18.519 --> 18:20.336
- How can I help you?
- Got a name?

18:20.545 --> 18:21.706
Hey, Director, how's...

18:21.826 --> 18:22.826
Name, Abby.

18:23.229 --> 18:24.542
Viggo Drantyev.

18:24.614 --> 18:28.101
Viggo as in Mortensen.
And Drantyev as in...

18:29.066 --> 18:30.830
- Drantyev.
- Background?

18:30.941 --> 18:34.119
He flew in from Moscow
three days ago, solo.

18:34.274 --> 18:37.216
Rented a car, checked in
to the Excelsior Hotel,

18:37.384 --> 18:39.164
and then he checked
out early this morning.

18:39.237 --> 18:41.461
- That's not background.
- That's all I have.

18:41.731 --> 18:44.123
Viggo Drantyev didn't
exist until three days ago.

18:44.352 --> 18:45.858
And he doesn't anymore.

18:46.348 --> 18:49.252
- A burn alias.
- Yeah, and a damn good one.

18:49.412 --> 18:52.027
Totally untraceable, which
is impressive these days.

18:52.174 --> 18:55.418
Whoever this guy is, he must
have friends in high places.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.912
Like, nosebleed.

18:57.236 --> 18:58.848
- Anything else?
- Nope.

19:00.362 --> 19:02.310
You want McGee to put out a BOLO?

19:02.974 --> 19:03.974
No.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.271
Erase the search.

19:08.753 --> 19:10.101
What search?

19:11.081 --> 19:13.616
So, Drantyev hits town

19:13.959 --> 19:16.452
and before sundown,
your boy Decker is dead.

19:17.001 --> 19:18.446
Not enough for a conviction.

19:19.075 --> 19:20.075
Enough for me.

19:20.406 --> 19:21.545
Who is he?

19:23.255 --> 19:24.616
You don't know.

19:25.287 --> 19:26.818
I know who sent him.

19:27.158 --> 19:28.739
And I know who he's after.

19:34.486 --> 19:37.462
- One, two, three.
- Breathe, damn it! Breathe!

19:37.509 --> 19:41.509
I don't recall shouting being one
of the instructions, Mr. Palmer.

19:42.010 --> 19:44.339
Sorry, Doctor, I guess I
got a little carried away.

19:44.596 --> 19:46.146
Hello, Jethro.

19:48.377 --> 19:49.377
New girlfriend?

19:49.560 --> 19:52.206
No, CPR recertifications.

19:52.373 --> 19:56.373
Work has been sufficiently slow lately
for me to be able to update them.

19:56.520 --> 19:59.578
When can I put your name on the list?

20:00.675 --> 20:01.793
Not today.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.915
Give us a minute please, Mr. Palmer.

20:06.045 --> 20:07.045
Yeah.

20:07.594 --> 20:08.893
Annie can stay.

20:14.396 --> 20:16.146
I know that look, Jethro.

20:17.211 --> 20:19.839
I'm afraid I'm all out of secrets.

20:20.244 --> 20:22.610
You read the autopsy report
on the Grenouille murder.

20:22.697 --> 20:24.186
Yes, what about it?

20:24.505 --> 20:25.505
Anything bug you?

20:25.770 --> 20:27.490
Normally, I am very bugged

20:27.610 --> 20:30.503
when a person is shot at
point-blank range in the head.

20:31.287 --> 20:34.219
But in this case,
despite the man's charm,

20:34.365 --> 20:36.334
I'm willing to make an exception.

20:36.859 --> 20:38.262
- That a "no"?
- Well,

20:38.294 --> 20:41.397
pathologically, there was
nothing out of the ordinary.

20:41.565 --> 20:44.355
A single bullet entered
Rene's frontal lobe,

20:44.418 --> 20:45.887
causing catastrophic

20:46.135 --> 20:49.821
cerebral hemorrhaging that resulted
in almost instantaneous death.

20:49.962 --> 20:51.704
Yeah. Yeah, I read that.

20:52.248 --> 20:53.881
Then you know as much as I do.

20:57.063 --> 20:58.063
Jethro...

20:59.535 --> 21:02.153
I had the impression
this case was closed.

21:02.382 --> 21:03.382
It is.

21:03.573 --> 21:04.912
Then why all the digging?

21:05.134 --> 21:06.564
What are you hoping to find?

21:08.982 --> 21:10.121
Answers, Duck.

21:10.325 --> 21:13.613
There's a reason why
sleeping dogs are left to lie,

21:14.158 --> 21:15.309
Jethro.

21:25.726 --> 21:27.360
California.

21:27.888 --> 21:29.842
There it is, the director's rental.

21:30.052 --> 21:31.811
Well, what can I tell you, kid?

21:31.957 --> 21:34.600
- When you're right, you're right.
- The car seems fine.

21:34.733 --> 21:37.518
Yes, it does.

21:37.779 --> 21:39.789
Now, can we get the hell out of here?

21:39.946 --> 21:42.082
No, that's a good idea.
We should stay here,

21:42.206 --> 21:44.363
wait for the director
to catch us snooping.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.816
- What is she doing here?
- You mean, who is she doing?

21:46.978 --> 21:49.679
You heard that guy on the phone.
She's probably at his hotel.

21:50.803 --> 21:52.600
Now you're making some sense.

21:53.199 --> 21:55.007
Where to, miss? Rodeo Drive?

21:55.430 --> 21:56.361
Venice Beach?

21:56.417 --> 21:59.310
Our hotel or I file kidnapping charges.

22:08.783 --> 22:10.291
This is not good.

22:14.043 --> 22:15.592
Let me handle this, okay?

22:18.282 --> 22:21.549
- Hey, you can't come up in here.
- NCIS. What's going on?

22:24.469 --> 22:25.469
Fatality.

22:27.139 --> 22:28.584
Looks like she fell.

22:52.103 --> 22:53.723
My kind of place.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.726
I'm not much of a people person.

22:57.846 --> 22:58.846
I noticed.

22:58.935 --> 23:00.192
Not that I don't like 'em.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.972
They never seem to like me.

23:02.417 --> 23:04.114
Decker didn't have that problem.

23:05.211 --> 23:06.661
Then why's he dead?

23:08.017 --> 23:11.128
Better save that for the guy that
killed Decker. You might need it.

23:11.270 --> 23:12.702
First we have to find him.

23:12.822 --> 23:15.007
If he knows about
Decker's insurance policy,

23:15.834 --> 23:16.972
he'll find us.

23:25.766 --> 23:27.849
There's no obvious signs of foul play.

23:27.983 --> 23:30.420
Depends on what you mean
by obvious. She is dead.

23:30.841 --> 23:32.469
You said she just buried her boyfriend.

23:32.493 --> 23:34.653
Well, she obviously, you
know, been hitting the bottle.

23:34.677 --> 23:37.724
- She could have fallen. Or jumped.
- Or was pushed.

23:38.758 --> 23:41.781
- You know something I don't?
- No. She she's just... it's, you know.

23:41.901 --> 23:43.695
Give us a second. Excuse me.

23:46.953 --> 23:49.252
- What are you doing?
- Leave the director out of this.

23:49.336 --> 23:52.380
- The director's car is right there.
- Yeah, there are 50 cars right there.

23:52.464 --> 23:55.870
Well, I'm not providing security
detail for those 50 others.

23:55.951 --> 23:57.435
Sasha's been dead for two hours.

23:57.498 --> 24:00.730
We talked to the director 20 minutes
ago. She said everything was fine.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.405
Probably just a coincidence.

24:02.744 --> 24:04.472
You don't really believe that, do you?

24:07.297 --> 24:08.297
No.

24:17.395 --> 24:19.221
This is not what it looks like, Gibbs.

24:19.341 --> 24:20.341
CPR.

24:21.348 --> 24:23.143
So, I guess it's exactly
what it looks like.

24:23.205 --> 24:24.685
- Ducky wanted us...
- I know.

24:24.956 --> 24:25.956
Right.

24:28.351 --> 24:30.302
So... what brings

24:30.894 --> 24:33.273
the Almighty Gibbs to my humble lab?

24:33.446 --> 24:34.447
The frog.

24:34.567 --> 24:36.620
Sorry I asked. I thought
that case was closed.

24:38.793 --> 24:42.434
Shell casings contain a
variety of useful data points.

24:43.928 --> 24:44.928
The first one...

24:45.843 --> 24:49.062
is this indentation
caused by the firing pin.

24:49.230 --> 24:51.826
Its position narrows down
the list of possible firearms.

24:52.063 --> 24:54.325
Can you tie it to a specific gun?

24:55.032 --> 24:57.239
Yep, in 2010.

24:57.379 --> 24:59.638
That's when the manufacturers
will be required by law

24:59.701 --> 25:02.133
to microstamp a serial
number onto the firing pin.

25:02.183 --> 25:04.456
- Today, Abs.
- Well, it depends on who you ask.

25:04.950 --> 25:05.997
I'm asking you.

25:06.039 --> 25:09.725
Okay, the second data point is this.

25:09.825 --> 25:12.753
It's breechblock pattern around
the back of the shell casing.

25:12.798 --> 25:15.290
It comes from the concussive
force of the gun firing.

25:15.503 --> 25:18.419
It won't let you say definitively
if a particular gun was used,

25:18.523 --> 25:20.121
but it can rule a gun out.

25:21.678 --> 25:23.377
This is interesting.

25:26.452 --> 25:27.933
That scratch,

25:28.546 --> 25:32.388
it could be an ejector impression
from when the spent case was ejected

25:32.588 --> 25:36.316
or it could have come from a
slight defect in the gun clip.

25:36.584 --> 25:40.309
I couldn't really say for sure
without inspecting the clip but,

25:40.384 --> 25:43.923
either way, I doubt it's definitive
enough to be admissible in court.

25:48.509 --> 25:49.509
I know.

25:49.672 --> 25:51.190
I have a really bad feeling, too.

25:51.358 --> 25:52.845
Why didn't you stop me?

25:55.992 --> 25:58.568
Thought you knew where
this insurance policy was.

25:58.794 --> 26:01.564
I never said I knew. Decker said I did.

26:02.793 --> 26:04.776
And stop looking at my ass.

26:05.863 --> 26:07.581
Not much else to look at.

26:07.757 --> 26:10.982
Of course, it might help if you were
to tell me what I was looking for.

26:11.225 --> 26:13.675
Decker knew that someone was after him.

26:14.624 --> 26:15.784
And he knew why.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.459
Your mystery op.

26:18.363 --> 26:21.316
Any useful insurance
policy would contain names.

26:21.836 --> 26:22.813
"Viggo".

26:22.837 --> 26:23.837
Real names.

26:23.953 --> 26:25.432
Targets. Dates.

26:25.502 --> 26:28.807
Plus operational blueprints, photos.

26:29.293 --> 26:30.801
We got plenty of those.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.648
These dates are wrong.

27:16.238 --> 27:17.332
Do you have a pen?

27:27.433 --> 27:30.302
This is Decker's
retirement party in 2007.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.808
Crime Analysts conference, '02.

27:39.284 --> 27:41.818
September 18, 2004.

27:43.058 --> 27:44.652
Hopkins - De La Hoya.

27:47.482 --> 27:49.335
This is some kind of code.

27:49.589 --> 27:51.267
Bank routing number?

27:51.702 --> 27:53.336
Too long for a cash account.

27:53.651 --> 27:55.515
Safe deposit box.

27:58.395 --> 27:59.395
Ziva.

27:59.508 --> 28:00.508
Again.

28:00.547 --> 28:03.236
You don't answer it, they're
gonna call in the SWAT team.

28:05.730 --> 28:08.401
This better be World
War III, Officer David.

28:08.652 --> 28:09.993
Sasha Gordon is dead.

28:12.593 --> 28:15.031
- What happened?
- LAPD's still investigating.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.472
It appears that she
broke her neck in a fall.

28:17.535 --> 28:18.717
Director, she was found

28:18.745 --> 28:22.019
less than a hundred meters away
from your vehicle. Where are you?

28:22.082 --> 28:24.039
- When?
- Three hours ago.

28:24.186 --> 28:26.002
Director, we are
assigned to protect you.

28:26.064 --> 28:28.135
This is not just a
coincidence. Where are you?

28:28.322 --> 28:30.631
I don't appreciate your
tone, Officer David.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.513
And despite what Special
Agent Gibbs may have told you,

28:33.549 --> 28:36.415
coincidences do exist. And
that is what we have here.

28:36.478 --> 28:38.111
- Okay, but...
- I'm fine.

28:38.505 --> 28:40.367
There's nothing to worry about.

28:40.487 --> 28:42.920
I'll meet you later to take
the red-eye flight home.

28:46.624 --> 28:47.624
Good news?

28:48.600 --> 28:49.781
Not for Sasha.

28:51.159 --> 28:52.159
That went well.

28:52.279 --> 28:54.217
The director's lying. She's not fine.

28:54.340 --> 28:55.591
Why would she lie?

28:55.711 --> 28:57.261
Maybe she was forced.

28:57.395 --> 28:59.524
- Did she use the duress word?
- No.

28:59.644 --> 29:00.931
Well then, there you go.

29:01.074 --> 29:04.089
If someone had a gun to her head,
she would use the duress word.

29:04.703 --> 29:06.850
Tony, there is something going on here.

29:07.017 --> 29:08.127
How can you not...

29:10.527 --> 29:11.699
You do see it.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.670
- You just don't want to get involved.
- She doesn't want us involved.

29:14.694 --> 29:17.437
If there's one thing I've learned
about the director's private wars,

29:17.471 --> 29:20.559
it's that it's best to stay
away. For her and for us.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.792
She's a big girl. She
can take care of herself.

29:22.861 --> 29:25.672
Besides, probably is
a coincidence, anyway.

29:25.714 --> 29:27.907
And she's behind one of
those expensive windows

29:27.938 --> 29:31.227
munching on overpriced cashews
courtesy of Mr. Outtatown.

29:36.335 --> 29:38.318
I told Sasha to leave town.

29:38.517 --> 29:41.322
Probably went back to her
apartment to grab a few things.

29:42.207 --> 29:45.411
If Viggo got to her, we
have to assume she talked.

29:45.557 --> 29:46.802
Knows about us.

29:47.364 --> 29:50.086
- And this place.
- And Decker's insurance policy.

30:09.434 --> 30:11.484
Guess he's gonna be on his way.

30:12.298 --> 30:13.779
If we leave now...

30:13.850 --> 30:15.085
You can go.

30:17.906 --> 30:19.100
I'm staying.

30:19.675 --> 30:21.476
This ends here.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.483
You're gonna need a clean one.

30:53.150 --> 30:55.110
- Gibbs.
- We should call him.

30:55.261 --> 30:56.727
But we're not going to.

30:58.569 --> 31:00.008
He would want us to.

31:00.034 --> 31:01.034
Would he?

31:01.076 --> 31:03.991
Of course. They were partners. If the
director was in trouble, he would...

31:04.015 --> 31:06.064
We do not know that she is in trouble.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.047
Okay, I'll give you that one.

31:10.987 --> 31:11.987
But...

31:13.171 --> 31:15.035
you want to be the one
to tell Gibbs that we

31:15.098 --> 31:16.815
let the director out of our sight?

31:17.817 --> 31:19.032
Good point.

31:19.631 --> 31:21.725
But it's a risk we have to take.

31:24.299 --> 31:25.618
Or we compromise.

31:34.381 --> 31:35.381
Agent McGee.

31:35.426 --> 31:37.877
What took you so long?
Were you sitting at my desk?

31:38.552 --> 31:39.848
- No.
- You're lying.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.194
- Tony, what do you want?
- Your advice.

31:43.214 --> 31:45.387
- You lost the director, didn't you?
- No.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.994
- Now, you're lying.
- You were sitting at my desk.

31:48.079 --> 31:50.243
We did not lose the director. We just...

31:50.363 --> 31:52.413
we just don't know where she is.

31:52.761 --> 31:54.158
Gibbs is gonna kill you guys.

31:54.282 --> 31:57.180
All right, calm down, McGee.
Don't get your panties in a twist.

31:57.355 --> 31:59.742
We just talked to her.
She said she's fine.

31:59.812 --> 32:01.319
She just said she needed...

32:01.508 --> 32:02.911
a little alone time.

32:03.111 --> 32:04.961
I'm just worried she
might be under duress.

32:05.363 --> 32:07.620
Did she use the duress word?

32:09.439 --> 32:10.445
No.

32:11.238 --> 32:12.560
Then she probably is fine.

32:12.584 --> 32:13.584
Thank you.

32:13.656 --> 32:15.030
The Great McOz has spoken.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.654
I need you to trace her cell.

32:16.774 --> 32:19.302
Wait, you want me to trace
the director's cell? Forget it.

32:19.345 --> 32:20.873
Gibbs is not gonna like that.

32:21.055 --> 32:22.940
I thought you said you
weren't gonna call him.

32:23.395 --> 32:24.513
We won't.

32:25.116 --> 32:27.371
If you trace her cell.

32:27.900 --> 32:28.998
Do it, McGee.

32:29.261 --> 32:32.430
If we figure out she's at the
Farmer's Daughter Motel with some guy,

32:32.555 --> 32:34.063
then we'll just call it a day.

32:35.941 --> 32:36.941
All right.

32:37.281 --> 32:39.074
Pulling up the director's ESN number.

32:39.157 --> 32:41.027
Pinging all towers in the L.A. area.

32:41.945 --> 32:43.097
No hits.

32:44.177 --> 32:45.655
Expand the search.

32:48.163 --> 32:50.830
Still no hits. Must have
her phone turned off.

32:50.992 --> 32:54.128
I can, however, tell you where
she made her last call from.

32:55.477 --> 32:58.765
Just off the 14, about 35
miles into the Mojave Desert.

32:58.923 --> 33:02.323
- 50 miles away from her car.
- You got an exact location?

33:02.503 --> 33:04.386
- I'll work on it.
- Let us know.

33:07.504 --> 33:10.126
- This is not a good idea.
- Humor me.

33:16.853 --> 33:19.157
You always clean your
gun before a fight?

33:19.535 --> 33:20.897
It's not my gun.

33:22.513 --> 33:24.817
You always sit on your ass before one?

33:26.537 --> 33:28.087
What should I be doing?

33:28.800 --> 33:31.125
Assessing our situation.

33:31.876 --> 33:33.383
You read that in the manual?

33:35.038 --> 33:36.725
Deadbolt: Schlage.

33:36.808 --> 33:38.253
Same lock as the front.

33:38.355 --> 33:41.789
Wood-frame, stucco exterior,
lath-and-plaster walls.

33:41.826 --> 33:43.140
Stone in the rear.

33:43.632 --> 33:46.690
If they don't come too heavy,
should provide adequate cover.

33:47.066 --> 33:48.804
Situation assessed.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.685
I never said thanks.

34:02.092 --> 34:03.411
Thank me later.

34:08.878 --> 34:10.402
When I first heard

34:10.474 --> 34:12.025
that Decker died of a heart attack,

34:13.225 --> 34:14.510
I was relieved

34:15.136 --> 34:17.398
Gibbs did say you were complicated.

34:17.728 --> 34:19.792
Relieved because I always knew

34:19.853 --> 34:22.806
that there was a chance this
could come back to haunt us.

34:24.530 --> 34:25.702
And it's my fault.

34:28.312 --> 34:31.013
I made some choices I'm
not particularly proud of.

34:32.090 --> 34:33.145
We all have.

34:34.099 --> 34:35.116
Even Gibbs?

34:36.648 --> 34:37.829
He let you go.

34:40.077 --> 34:41.077
No.

34:41.764 --> 34:42.966
He didn't.

34:44.007 --> 34:46.554
He didn't fit into my five-point plan.

34:47.136 --> 34:48.435
Back to choices.

34:48.878 --> 34:50.121
You made your bed.

34:50.871 --> 34:52.466
What if I don't want to sleep in it?

34:56.562 --> 34:57.776
Gibbs knows?

34:58.363 --> 34:59.793
Would it make a difference?

35:00.540 --> 35:02.001
He came back, didn't he?

35:02.582 --> 35:03.999
Came back for the job.

35:04.300 --> 35:07.546
Well, that would explain all the
conversations we had on my boat.

35:09.744 --> 35:10.744
You know,

35:11.223 --> 35:12.500
about the job.

35:15.398 --> 35:16.848
You're still young.

35:17.330 --> 35:19.351
You got plenty of time to make right.

35:42.549 --> 35:43.680
We could have made it.

35:43.722 --> 35:46.163
The needle is below "E."
"E" stands for empty.

35:46.208 --> 35:47.946
We have less than empty.

35:48.034 --> 35:49.880
And we don't even know where it is.

35:50.026 --> 35:51.261
We could have made it.

35:51.324 --> 35:52.434
- What?!
- What?!

36:02.753 --> 36:04.408
Try to make yourself useful.

36:04.534 --> 36:05.534
What?!

36:05.934 --> 36:07.818
I said, why don't you
make yourself useful?

36:09.649 --> 36:11.155
What do you want me to do?

36:11.377 --> 36:12.947
Hold your nozzle?

36:14.120 --> 36:15.293
Get us a map.

36:22.710 --> 36:24.301
Some white powdered donuts.

36:24.737 --> 36:26.161
And some Blue Ice Gatorade.

36:31.213 --> 36:34.402
- You better have my coordinates.
- Even better. I got an address.

36:34.619 --> 36:37.534
Did some checking. Turns out Decker
has a little diner in the desert,

36:37.585 --> 36:39.407
and I can place Jenny's
call to within...

36:39.449 --> 36:40.765
What's the address?

36:40.816 --> 36:43.245
- Just sent it to your PDA.
- You deserve a probie snack.

36:43.372 --> 36:46.468
Get yourself one, but not from my
desk drawer. Use the vending machine.

36:52.595 --> 36:55.701
Might be hard to believe,
but I was in love once.

36:56.112 --> 36:57.329
Her name was Maggie.

36:57.615 --> 36:58.858
She had it all.

36:59.231 --> 37:01.702
Quick as a fox, great curves.

37:01.848 --> 37:03.251
Trusted her with my life.

37:03.649 --> 37:04.725
What happened?

37:05.471 --> 37:07.863
Traded her for a Harley
when the transmission blew.

37:11.088 --> 37:14.468
You know, when I asked
you if Gibbs knew,

37:15.206 --> 37:17.835
I wasn't talking about
your feelings for him.

37:18.762 --> 37:21.853
I was asking if he knew you were sick.

37:23.878 --> 37:25.682
Gonna lie to me now?

37:27.374 --> 37:29.026
What makes you think I'm sick?

37:29.557 --> 37:32.698
Person gets a look in their
eye when time's running out.

37:33.176 --> 37:34.422
You're not that good.

37:36.989 --> 37:39.842
- Found your pills.
- You went through my purse?

37:39.962 --> 37:43.417
Your purse and your cell
phone and your glove box.

37:43.722 --> 37:45.337
Just being thorough?

37:45.395 --> 37:46.395
You blame me?

37:51.554 --> 37:52.601
Gibbs doesn't know.

37:55.951 --> 37:57.934
What are you waiting for?

37:59.509 --> 38:00.773
Good question.

38:54.126 --> 38:55.424
- What?
- Turn

38:55.841 --> 38:57.936
at the giant cactus, right?

38:59.214 --> 39:00.658
That is what he said.

39:09.102 --> 39:11.249
- Found some tea.
- What kind?

39:12.263 --> 39:13.263
Does it matter?

39:13.551 --> 39:15.352
Only drink lemongrass.

39:15.937 --> 39:18.618
You just don't strike me as
a tea-drinking kind of guy.

39:18.876 --> 39:20.636
And people say I don't open up.

39:20.804 --> 39:24.050
Well, no water, so, so much for the tea.

39:25.233 --> 39:27.119
I spotted a water tank out back.

39:27.638 --> 39:29.358
- I'll go.
- Let me.

39:29.504 --> 39:31.562
I've got to hit the head again anyway.

39:32.272 --> 39:33.319
You're up.

39:56.542 --> 39:58.547
The weapon was loaded,
and I wasn't here,

39:58.987 --> 40:00.957
would you have pulled the trigger?

40:12.116 --> 40:14.314
Thought you might want this back.

41:34.867 --> 41:36.146
There it is.

41:37.088 --> 41:39.340
Look. I have seen that SUV before.

41:40.796 --> 41:41.969
Gas station.

41:45.924 --> 41:48.626
You still believe the director's
on one of your booty calls?

41:49.295 --> 41:51.767
Well, if there's a sock on
the doorknob, you're knocking.

42:07.776 --> 42:08.991
You're in.

42:22.445 --> 42:23.445
Clear.

42:38.838 --> 42:39.838
Tony.

43:27.659 --> 43:28.659
Jenny?

43:29.386 --> 43:30.959
Jenny, you there?

43:42.600 --> 43:43.676
Wait there.

43:44.775 --> 43:46.125
I'll come to you.

44:17.946 --> 44:19.146
I said to wait.

44:19.777 --> 44:21.094
And I said not to.

44:22.067 --> 44:23.327
This is my crime scene.

44:28.843 --> 44:30.893
You called SECNAV, he called me.

44:38.928 --> 44:40.278
I'm sorry, Jethro.

45:05.679 --> 45:07.829
Bodies were picked up last night.

45:08.244 --> 45:09.694
They're going to D.C.

45:10.368 --> 45:12.927
- Ducky?
- He'll be handling the autopsies.

45:15.898 --> 45:18.748
First two shooters came
through the front door,

45:19.076 --> 45:21.326
the other two came from over there.

45:23.746 --> 45:24.996
She stood here.

45:26.591 --> 45:28.059
She got off the first shots.

45:28.875 --> 45:31.562
Shooter number one never
even fired his weapon.

45:34.247 --> 45:35.900
She took heavy fire after that.

45:39.982 --> 45:42.990
One in the shoulder, one in the
arm. She started moving this way,

45:43.356 --> 45:45.660
the other two entered
through the side door.

45:47.309 --> 45:49.359
Second shooter went down there.

45:52.862 --> 45:55.686
She dropped to her knee.
She fired three more times.

46:00.626 --> 46:02.176
Which leaves the fourth shooter.

46:13.406 --> 46:15.056
We know how that ended.

46:19.155 --> 46:20.945
She put up a hell of a fight.

46:22.988 --> 46:24.238
Not good enough.

46:24.779 --> 46:26.929
She was outnumbered, five to one.

46:29.294 --> 46:31.544
I think you got to check your math.

46:37.698 --> 46:41.489
We found four.45 caliber
shell casings and no.45.

46:42.909 --> 46:45.059
Somebody walked out of here alive.

46:47.903 --> 46:49.753
There was a second car here.

46:50.210 --> 46:52.060
It was the director's ride.

46:52.495 --> 46:54.645
The fifth gunman must've taken it.

46:55.655 --> 46:58.407
- No blood?
- Nothing but a tire track.

46:59.098 --> 47:02.574
We'll put out a BOLO as
soon as we can I.D. the car.

47:02.810 --> 47:05.448
I'm sure you want to get
this bastard as bad as I do.

47:09.028 --> 47:10.619
Bodies are on their way to D.C.

47:11.440 --> 47:14.990
I chartered a private transport,
should be arriving shortly.

47:17.060 --> 47:19.451
- What do you got?
- I'm sorry, Gibbs.

47:20.289 --> 47:22.089
- We are sorry.
- What do you got?

47:22.318 --> 47:23.394
Not a lot.

47:24.260 --> 47:26.594
Tire tracks are from a second vehicle.

47:29.341 --> 47:30.851
We're working on it.

47:33.303 --> 47:35.555
We should've tailed her. Ziva...

47:35.882 --> 47:37.532
Ziva wanted to tail her.

47:38.514 --> 47:39.818
Why didn't you?

47:40.404 --> 47:41.787
We were given an order.

47:42.321 --> 47:43.419
And you followed it.

47:43.900 --> 47:45.450
And now Jenny is dead.

47:46.480 --> 47:47.698
We keep a lid on this.

47:48.804 --> 47:51.234
No press, no public
statements. Understood?

47:51.755 --> 47:53.329
It's a cover-up. Understood.

47:54.704 --> 47:56.707
I'm heading back to
D.C. with the bodies.

47:57.001 --> 48:00.325
Agent Gibbs, you will remain
here and oversee my investigation.

48:00.776 --> 48:03.214
I'll expect a call when you're finished.

48:09.768 --> 48:11.650
Oversee his investigation.

48:17.653 --> 48:19.003
And then call me.

48:36.604 --> 48:37.604
You're late.

48:39.046 --> 48:40.796
The least of my problems.

48:41.490 --> 48:45.131
Well, I got another one for you.
Vance knows there was someone else

48:45.253 --> 48:47.091
- at the diner.
- My tire tracks?

48:48.548 --> 48:50.678
I'm not the only one with a problem.

48:51.355 --> 48:53.305
Jenny died protecting someone.

48:54.425 --> 48:55.425
Who?

48:56.067 --> 48:57.067
You.

49:06.993 --> 49:09.765
- Call him again.
- I've already left Tony five messages.

49:09.887 --> 49:11.726
- Call Ziva.
- Eight messages.

49:12.592 --> 49:14.895
Why'd you call Ziva more
than you called Tony?

49:15.017 --> 49:18.149
Right, not important. What is
important is we remain calm.

49:18.513 --> 49:21.068
- I am calm.
- Don't you care about your friends?

49:21.092 --> 49:22.393
You just said...

49:22.417 --> 49:23.201
Nevermind.

49:23.225 --> 49:25.087
We haven't heard anything
from Tony and Ziva,

49:25.111 --> 49:27.136
then Gibbs gets on an
airplane without a word.

49:27.160 --> 49:28.908
Something is wrong! I can feel it.

49:29.356 --> 49:32.406
If something bad happened,
I'm sure we would've...

49:32.949 --> 49:34.790
- heard by now.
- What is it?

49:34.946 --> 49:37.060
- E-mail from Tony.
- Let me see.

49:37.157 --> 49:38.298
I can't look.

49:41.046 --> 49:42.743
Photos... tire prints.

49:43.062 --> 49:45.968
Tony wants me to find out
what car it came from asap.

49:47.297 --> 49:48.297
That's it?!

49:48.973 --> 49:52.108
- Are they working a case?
- Am I interrupting something?

49:52.430 --> 49:54.310
Just Abby's nervous breakdown.

49:54.699 --> 49:56.333
I'm sure everyone is fine.

49:56.883 --> 49:59.231
Do you have any reason
to believe otherwise?

49:59.594 --> 50:02.652
Well, Tony just e-mailed me. It
looks like they've started working

50:02.774 --> 50:05.029
- some kind of case.
- So there's your answer.

50:05.151 --> 50:06.777
They're working on a case.

50:06.801 --> 50:10.629
Common courtesy is the first
casuality in a Jethro war.

50:12.280 --> 50:13.280
Who is it?

50:17.097 --> 50:18.147
It's for me.

50:18.833 --> 50:19.833
Jethro...

50:22.067 --> 50:23.067
Ducky.

50:24.903 --> 50:27.217
I know I typically
dominate the conversation,

50:27.241 --> 50:28.814
but since you called me...

50:28.838 --> 50:29.976
Jenny's dead.

50:32.190 --> 50:33.190
Yesterday.

50:35.374 --> 50:36.374
Oh, dear...

50:37.590 --> 50:40.856
- I can't believe that it happened so...
- She was murdered.

50:41.271 --> 50:42.271
Firefight.

50:44.093 --> 50:46.103
- Tony and Ziva?
- Not involved.

50:46.875 --> 50:48.656
- What can I do?
- Five bodies...

50:49.240 --> 50:52.719
- on their way.
- I assume one of them is...

50:54.454 --> 50:56.455
Tell McGee, tell Abby.
I'm gonna need them.

51:01.806 --> 51:02.956
I know, Duck.

51:13.542 --> 51:14.542
Who?

51:33.114 --> 51:34.118
Everything.

51:36.338 --> 51:38.366
She called me two days ago.

51:39.637 --> 51:41.744
Said she needed some help

51:41.768 --> 51:44.251
from someone outside the agency.

51:45.449 --> 51:47.007
Another one of her ops.

51:47.483 --> 51:48.841
One of yours.

51:49.585 --> 51:50.585
Europe.

51:52.703 --> 51:55.248
Well, I spent a lot of time in Europe.

51:56.973 --> 51:58.423
She wasn't specific.

52:01.595 --> 52:03.731
What'd I tell you about

52:03.853 --> 52:05.712
leaving them loose ends?

52:05.938 --> 52:06.938
Not to.

52:07.956 --> 52:08.956
We didn't.

52:10.289 --> 52:13.391
Well, you screwed the pooch somewhere.

52:15.082 --> 52:16.695
Decker's cover was blown.

52:17.151 --> 52:20.139
They found him. Made it
look like a heart attack.

52:21.832 --> 52:22.832
"They"?

52:24.428 --> 52:25.878
Decker's funeral...

52:26.693 --> 52:30.306
there was a guy named Viggo
came looking for a man.

52:30.973 --> 52:32.256
Oshimaida.

52:34.843 --> 52:35.993
Relax, probie.

52:36.323 --> 52:38.849
Classified went out
the window two days ago.

52:40.417 --> 52:43.549
I know Oshimaida was the code you used

52:43.573 --> 52:45.523
if your cover was compromised.

52:46.084 --> 52:48.612
In Paris, nine years ago.

52:50.136 --> 52:51.771
Decker resurrected it.

52:52.978 --> 52:56.225
When I found him,
instead of giving you up,

52:56.588 --> 52:58.233
he sent you a warning.

52:59.789 --> 53:01.539
Bought you guys some time.

53:02.185 --> 53:03.185
Not enough.

53:03.946 --> 53:06.636
She knew what she was getting into.

53:08.503 --> 53:11.524
Her last stand was to protect you.

53:13.909 --> 53:16.371
Who protected her, Mike?

53:20.678 --> 53:21.828
What happened?

53:25.489 --> 53:26.979
I was out back.

53:28.349 --> 53:30.563
I saw 'em going in the side door.

53:34.408 --> 53:35.408
Too late.

53:41.252 --> 53:42.721
I did what I could.

53:45.726 --> 53:46.876
You always do.

53:49.225 --> 53:51.475
If you're looking for an apology...

53:52.952 --> 53:54.102
I know better.

53:57.263 --> 53:58.611
I'm sorry, Gunny.

54:06.992 --> 54:09.398
I'm almost done here.
Where's that next batch?

54:10.821 --> 54:11.821
Coming.

54:33.048 --> 54:34.048
It's okay.

54:35.150 --> 54:36.436
Abby, it's okay.

54:37.474 --> 54:39.050
No, it's not.

54:45.693 --> 54:47.143
We have work to do.

54:54.599 --> 54:56.998
- Abby, slow down.
- I can't.

54:59.648 --> 55:00.648
Let me.

55:06.393 --> 55:07.943
How could this happen?

55:09.283 --> 55:10.433
I don't know.

55:16.100 --> 55:17.850
Where were Tony and Ziva?!

55:19.699 --> 55:20.849
I don't know.

55:21.032 --> 55:24.056
And don't ask me what I do know,
because I don't know that, either.

55:29.555 --> 55:30.896
I need more time.

55:31.084 --> 55:33.339
How long does it take to
track a tire print, McGee?

55:33.363 --> 55:34.900
We're going as fast as we can.

55:35.301 --> 55:38.519
- Tony, what happened?
- Not the time... I need that ID now.

55:38.734 --> 55:41.815
Got it. It's a P-235
all-season radial.

55:42.450 --> 55:43.798
It's a custom mold.

55:43.919 --> 55:47.496
Sold exclusively to the Western Rental
chain for their Mercury Grand Marquis.

55:47.710 --> 55:50.063
Check their Los Angeles Airport office.

55:50.087 --> 55:52.418
All Grand Marquis rented
in the last 48 hours.

55:52.602 --> 55:54.118
Got it. Calling you back.

55:54.142 --> 55:57.131
Do it now, or have Abby do it.
She seems to be having better luck.

56:01.148 --> 56:03.595
We're opening a port into
Western Rental Servers.

56:04.323 --> 56:07.349
I'm checking all the customer
records for the last 48 hours.

56:07.533 --> 56:09.727
Ten Grand Marquis at the LAX office.

56:10.397 --> 56:13.003
Three rented this week. Only
one in the past two days.

56:13.027 --> 56:16.797
It hasn't been returned.
Joe Hill out of New Mexico.

56:19.136 --> 56:21.994
No listing at the DMV.
Must have used a fake ID.

56:22.018 --> 56:24.398
That's our guy. Get
it! I want that photo.

56:24.422 --> 56:27.607
Well, it's not on the server, but
I should be able to find it on...

56:34.217 --> 56:36.467
- What?
- It is not McGee's fault.

56:36.555 --> 56:37.796
No. It's not.

56:41.075 --> 56:42.585
We left Paris clean.

56:47.837 --> 56:48.987
Jenny told me.

56:49.634 --> 56:51.446
And I might have bought it,

56:51.723 --> 56:52.723
except...

56:53.670 --> 56:55.832
there were three agents on that op.

56:56.693 --> 56:57.843
Two are dead.

57:00.086 --> 57:01.086
The op?

57:07.467 --> 57:08.467
How many?

57:11.098 --> 57:12.098
One each.

57:15.446 --> 57:16.956
You verify the kill?

57:18.440 --> 57:19.440
Her kill.

57:21.610 --> 57:22.728
Jen was a pro.

57:24.589 --> 57:25.589
I noticed.

57:27.234 --> 57:28.562
What about Decker?

57:28.901 --> 57:32.363
- I hear he had a thing for the ladies.
- What is your point?

57:32.850 --> 57:34.464
Maybe he was compromised.

57:35.148 --> 57:36.513
We got out clean.

57:40.900 --> 57:43.589
Jenny knew something you didn't, probie.

57:44.462 --> 57:45.848
And so did Decker.

57:47.412 --> 57:49.853
He knew this might not be over.

57:50.457 --> 57:52.340
Left an insurance policy.

57:55.918 --> 57:57.304
The numbers were...

57:59.045 --> 58:00.295
Coded in photos.

58:01.446 --> 58:04.433
- The way we did it back then.
- We burned the original.

58:05.501 --> 58:07.051
That's the only copy.

58:08.830 --> 58:10.180
I'll let you know.

58:12.909 --> 58:14.852
You need me on this one, probie.

58:15.618 --> 58:18.861
Viggo was just a hired gun.
There's someone else out there.

58:19.650 --> 58:21.400
It's not your fight, Mike.

58:23.441 --> 58:24.778
Vance is looking for you.

58:25.704 --> 58:27.317
So go back to Mexico.

58:28.323 --> 58:30.473
Give my goddaughter a hug for me.

58:39.688 --> 58:41.878
Joe Hill. H-I-L-L.

58:42.651 --> 58:44.701
Great. Send the photo. Thanks.

58:54.533 --> 58:55.708
You got a pen?

58:56.942 --> 58:58.842
- I'm sorry...
- You got a pen?

59:00.895 --> 59:01.899
Got a keyboard.

59:02.410 --> 59:04.067
Seven-one-three-nine-nine,

59:04.649 --> 59:05.682
dash,

59:05.816 --> 59:08.447
two-one-eight-one, dash,
five-three-seven-eight.

59:08.916 --> 59:10.866
- What is it?
- I don't know.

59:11.725 --> 59:13.380
But I'm going to find out.

59:14.409 --> 59:16.493
- When are you back?
- On my way.

59:16.744 --> 59:18.290
What about Tony and...

59:20.354 --> 59:22.908
- McGee?
- Boss, we got a problem here.

59:24.519 --> 59:25.519
Just one?

59:25.826 --> 59:28.750
The I.D. on the tire tracks
from Decker's diner came in.

59:28.774 --> 59:30.677
- Car was rented to...
- Mike Franks.

59:31.504 --> 59:33.847
- Yeah. How did you...?
- Erase it.

59:34.600 --> 59:37.125
- Agent Vance wanted...
- McGee, erase it!

01:00:07.091 --> 01:00:08.094
Viggo.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.025
Makes me miss California already.

01:00:16.236 --> 01:00:19.063
Assistant Director Vance.
Didn't know that you were...

01:00:19.202 --> 01:00:21.397
Just got in. Late night?

01:00:21.943 --> 01:00:24.986
- Still logging crime scene photos.
- Anything on the shooters?

01:00:27.275 --> 01:00:30.606
Three of them had a list of
prior felonies in the L.A. area.

01:00:30.942 --> 01:00:33.494
- $5,000 cash on them.
- Local hires.

01:00:34.026 --> 01:00:36.789
The fourth shooter used a
burn-alias to fly from Moscow

01:00:36.914 --> 01:00:38.652
into D.C., finally into L.A.

01:00:39.278 --> 01:00:40.582
Viggo Drantyev.

01:00:40.758 --> 01:00:42.708
Abby and I ran the
name for the Direct...

01:00:47.991 --> 01:00:48.991
The...

01:00:50.048 --> 01:00:51.875
director took a photo of him

01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:53.597
at William Decker's funeral.

01:00:53.621 --> 01:00:55.276
Asked us to get an ID.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.186
BOLO?

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.522
There wasn't one.

01:01:03.842 --> 01:01:05.863
Have Washington-Dulles TSA

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:09.072
pull every piece of security
footage on Mr. Drantyev.

01:01:09.337 --> 01:01:11.115
The gate, customs, baggage claim.

01:01:11.671 --> 01:01:12.721
On it, boss.

01:01:14.964 --> 01:01:16.537
Any lead on the fifth shooter?

01:01:18.566 --> 01:01:19.616
Nothing yet.

01:01:19.992 --> 01:01:22.042
All right, give it another hour.

01:01:22.164 --> 01:01:23.711
Then go home, get some rest.

01:01:41.576 --> 01:01:42.576
Doctor.

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:45.063
I've never had to...

01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:47.279
autopsy a colleague.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:52.034
I assure you, Mr. Palmer, the
next one won't be any easier.

01:01:57.118 --> 01:02:00.946
You, my dear, were a woman who
always knew what she wanted.

01:02:01.694 --> 01:02:05.447
A trait which some may
have seen as mere careerism,

01:02:05.471 --> 01:02:09.030
rather than the true sense
of duty, I know carried you.

01:02:10.123 --> 01:02:12.042
That's why I can't help wondering

01:02:12.066 --> 01:02:15.231
if your death, too, was on your terms.

01:02:29.035 --> 01:02:30.215
I am sorry.

01:02:31.067 --> 01:02:32.266
I must have...

01:02:53.825 --> 01:02:55.094
She was dying, Jethro.

01:02:56.535 --> 01:02:59.908
She knew the deterioration
would have been rapid.

01:03:00.544 --> 01:03:03.027
Debilitating pain, loss of motor skills.

01:03:04.102 --> 01:03:06.296
As difficult as it is to say,

01:03:06.548 --> 01:03:08.691
this may have been more merciful.

01:03:27.022 --> 01:03:28.367
Naval Criminal...

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.102
I spoke with you earlier. You were
supposed to send me four security tapes.

01:03:33.126 --> 01:03:35.422
You only sent me three. Thank you.

01:03:36.854 --> 01:03:39.593
- I hate airport security.
- Makes two of us.

01:03:44.515 --> 01:03:45.632
Rough flight?

01:03:55.712 --> 01:03:57.553
I saw you two went swimming.

01:04:03.964 --> 01:04:05.414
What are you saying?

01:04:08.767 --> 01:04:10.217
I was... saying I...

01:04:10.852 --> 01:04:12.998
saw that picture of Ziva at the pool.

01:04:17.267 --> 01:04:18.267
Say it.

01:04:19.184 --> 01:04:21.273
- Say what?
- I screwed up.

01:04:21.387 --> 01:04:23.083
You can say it, probie.

01:04:24.343 --> 01:04:25.893
It was not your fault.

01:04:26.389 --> 01:04:27.589
Thank you.

01:04:32.426 --> 01:04:34.176
Sure, be right down, boss.

01:04:36.419 --> 01:04:37.419
Abby's lab.

01:04:37.991 --> 01:04:41.220
I've barely had a chance to
finish unpacking this stuff,

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:44.495
let alone processing it. I
don't have anything for you.

01:04:45.696 --> 01:04:47.433
- You will.
- I will.

01:04:47.474 --> 01:04:50.731
- And it'll be my best work.
- Always is, Abs.

01:04:51.286 --> 01:04:54.736
It's different this time. This
time it's for the director.

01:04:54.926 --> 01:04:56.705
This'll be my very best work.

01:05:07.502 --> 01:05:08.930
I tried not to sad.

01:05:09.738 --> 01:05:10.771
It's okay.

01:05:11.587 --> 01:05:14.408
She was always such a
snappy dresser, you know?

01:05:14.432 --> 01:05:15.549
Like classy.

01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:17.636
I never told her that.

01:05:18.236 --> 01:05:19.739
Why didn't I tell her that?

01:05:19.979 --> 01:05:22.241
She would have liked that.
She would have smiled.

01:05:23.058 --> 01:05:26.120
You can't wait with stuff like that,
'cause you never know what'll happen.

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:28.873
I like the way you dress.

01:05:29.514 --> 01:05:31.625
It's masculine and spruce.

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:33.444
Always with a jacket.

01:05:33.587 --> 01:05:35.159
See, even you smiled.

01:05:36.659 --> 01:05:39.344
And Tony... you're
business but after-hours.

01:05:40.162 --> 01:05:41.238
It's nice.

01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:45.306
Ziva, you kick ass, and
you look so good doing it.

01:05:54.921 --> 01:05:57.171
- Boss, I...
- It's not your fault.

01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:02.490
- Only one thing to be concerned about.
- Finding the Director's killer.

01:06:03.179 --> 01:06:04.610
Should I call Vance?

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.036
Unanimous no.

01:06:09.526 --> 01:06:12.416
- Was this a hit?
- Well, it was personal, has to be.

01:06:12.581 --> 01:06:14.585
Why else would she have
brought along Franks?

01:06:15.191 --> 01:06:16.796
She died trying to end something.

01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:19.798
Does that mean the
"something" is still happening?

01:06:19.822 --> 01:06:21.629
It's a good question, David.

01:06:35.107 --> 01:06:36.107
Don't ask.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:42.947
Why wasn't I invited to the party?

01:06:44.421 --> 01:06:46.826
Team lost a member,
Leon. Hardly a party.

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:51.164
Did I miss anything?

01:06:51.476 --> 01:06:53.717
Then I guess you were on
your way up to brief me

01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:56.891
on the only guy that walked
out of that diner alive.

01:07:00.636 --> 01:07:02.186
We'll take the stairs.

01:07:07.783 --> 01:07:10.558
Tire tracks led to a car
rental company at LAX.

01:07:10.824 --> 01:07:13.390
Mercury Marquis rented to a Joe Hill.

01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:15.364
We're still waiting on the I.D.

01:07:15.838 --> 01:07:17.369
San Diego team working on this?

01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:19.712
Nobody knows anything about Jenny.

01:07:19.996 --> 01:07:21.735
Don't worry, I'm sure your people

01:07:21.759 --> 01:07:24.034
would eventually have put
together the missing pieces.

01:07:25.942 --> 01:07:27.348
Or have you already?

01:07:29.984 --> 01:07:33.634
You think you can protect them
forever, Gibbs, you're mistaken.

01:07:33.862 --> 01:07:35.848
There's already been one casualty.

01:07:36.159 --> 01:07:37.609
There will be more.

01:07:45.745 --> 01:07:47.276
We got something, boss.

01:07:47.904 --> 01:07:51.140
- Rest of the airport footage from TSA.
- Why are you whispering, McGee?

01:07:51.262 --> 01:07:52.766
You know, I didn't want...

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:56.000
to yell.

01:07:56.195 --> 01:07:58.564
Didn't want to yell. You
were across the room there...

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:01.073
Right. The footage you
requested just came in.

01:08:01.571 --> 01:08:02.668
Let's see it.

01:08:04.817 --> 01:08:08.495
The first three clips show Viggo
Drantyev walking through the terminal,

01:08:08.519 --> 01:08:10.117
passing up baggage claim.

01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:12.819
Pros usually travel light.

01:08:13.326 --> 01:08:14.567
Then exits.

01:08:15.016 --> 01:08:17.179
The last piece they just
sent in is from outside.

01:08:17.203 --> 01:08:19.651
That is Viggo coming
through the door right there.

01:08:19.675 --> 01:08:22.220
- Cab number and plate, McGee?
- On it.

01:08:23.304 --> 01:08:24.304
Wait.

01:08:25.354 --> 01:08:27.259
Professionals do not share cabs.

01:08:28.493 --> 01:08:30.011
Viggo wasn't traveling alone.

01:08:31.457 --> 01:08:32.506
Run it back.

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:40.022
You know what? Let me pull up
the photos from the funeral.

01:08:42.444 --> 01:08:44.395
That could be the same woman.

01:08:44.832 --> 01:08:46.362
Either of you recognize her?

01:08:48.616 --> 01:08:50.066
Agent Gibbs, you...

01:08:55.258 --> 01:08:57.243
McGee, get him back here. Now.

01:09:22.555 --> 01:09:23.604
Where is he?

01:09:23.978 --> 01:09:26.331
- Who, Gibbs?
- David.

01:09:27.337 --> 01:09:30.238
I am sorry, but I do not have
the slightest clue where...

01:09:30.263 --> 01:09:31.263
McGee.

01:09:35.256 --> 01:09:37.892
Photo pops up, Gibbs
runs off the reservation,

01:09:37.916 --> 01:09:40.840
- and nobody knows a damn thing.
- Sounds like a Wednesday.

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:42.243
And her?

01:09:43.884 --> 01:09:45.434
Your director's dead.

01:09:45.783 --> 01:09:48.555
The director you were assigned to
protect is dead. We'll get to that.

01:09:48.678 --> 01:09:51.350
But right now, I need
to know what Gibbs knows.

01:09:55.034 --> 01:09:56.784
Decker left a code behind,

01:09:57.455 --> 01:09:59.108
some kind of insurance policy.

01:09:59.132 --> 01:10:01.021
It's a string of 13 numbers.

01:10:01.558 --> 01:10:04.054
- Don't know what they mean yet.
- Find out.

01:10:04.156 --> 01:10:06.698
I will. And when I do,
you'll be the first to know.

01:10:06.722 --> 01:10:09.535
The second, but for now,
I'll take what I can get.

01:10:12.693 --> 01:10:14.839
- The mystery woman.
- Name. Go.

01:10:23.421 --> 01:10:25.843
- McGee sent you an e-mail.
- No, I didn't get any...

01:10:27.882 --> 01:10:28.888
Neat.

01:10:31.274 --> 01:10:32.254
Who is she?

01:10:32.278 --> 01:10:35.061
We wouldn't be down here
if we knew, would we?

01:10:36.307 --> 01:10:39.023
- Facial recognition?
- Start with Interpol.

01:10:39.176 --> 01:10:41.013
- Eastern Europe.
- What country?

01:10:41.037 --> 01:10:42.393
- All of them.
- That...

01:10:42.417 --> 01:10:43.638
Just do it!

01:10:45.976 --> 01:10:46.990
Please.

01:10:53.247 --> 01:10:54.497
Come on, baby.

01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:59.544
- Come on!
- Have you tried latitude and longitude?

01:11:01.621 --> 01:11:03.381
Leads to an asparagus field in Chile.

01:11:03.848 --> 01:11:07.009
It's too many digits for a pin number.
It's too few for a bank account.

01:11:07.131 --> 01:11:08.678
Encrypted code, then?

01:11:09.985 --> 01:11:12.012
I've tried letter substitution.

01:11:12.036 --> 01:11:14.559
I've tried frequency
analysis. Affine shift ciphers.

01:11:15.357 --> 01:11:16.894
Affine shift ciphers?

01:11:18.532 --> 01:11:20.481
It's kind of hard to
explain. No offense.

01:11:20.947 --> 01:11:23.170
You mean it's hard to
explain why you'd waste time

01:11:23.194 --> 01:11:26.320
on an affine shift without even
knowing the multiplicative inverse?

01:11:28.431 --> 01:11:30.825
- I thought...
- Have you tried a transposition cipher?

01:11:31.337 --> 01:11:33.202
- Not yet.
- Vigenère encryption?

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:34.731
Well, I was going to.

01:11:35.175 --> 01:11:36.565
So you haven't done anything?

01:11:42.037 --> 01:11:43.787
You call me when you have.

01:11:55.447 --> 01:11:57.397
Surprised it took you so long.

01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:00.221
Thank God for Ducky.

01:12:03.104 --> 01:12:05.278
You have not listened
to anything I have said.

01:12:05.302 --> 01:12:07.653
Well, it's only been three
years, I'm a slow learner.

01:12:09.302 --> 01:12:10.899
And a slow healer.

01:12:11.626 --> 01:12:13.576
You're crying over spilled...

01:12:13.757 --> 01:12:14.757
milk.

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:16.871
It's not milk that I spilled.

01:12:17.598 --> 01:12:20.168
- Do not do this, Tony.
- Don't do what?

01:12:20.192 --> 01:12:23.312
Blow my protection detail?
Blow my undercover assignment?

01:12:23.676 --> 01:12:25.526
Those sound like apologies.

01:12:41.693 --> 01:12:42.943
She died alone.

01:12:43.873 --> 01:12:45.223
We are all alone.

01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:48.007
Thanks for that.

01:12:48.688 --> 01:12:52.005
I just mean that she never got
married. Never had any children.

01:12:52.474 --> 01:12:54.241
Never even heard her talk about it.

01:12:59.622 --> 01:13:00.623
Paris.

01:13:04.063 --> 01:13:05.644
That's when it must have happened.

01:13:05.987 --> 01:13:07.297
The two of them alone

01:13:07.464 --> 01:13:09.550
- in another world.
- Putting their lives

01:13:09.574 --> 01:13:13.260
- in each others' hands every day.
- Not to mention the long nights.

01:13:13.464 --> 01:13:14.804
It was inevitable.

01:13:17.357 --> 01:13:18.849
Nothing is inevitable.

01:13:59.427 --> 01:14:01.684
- I got it!
- Got what?

01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:04.600
I think I figured out the code.

01:14:05.303 --> 01:14:06.753
John Anthony Walker.

01:14:08.803 --> 01:14:11.557
He was a Navy warrant
officer. He was busted in '85

01:14:11.581 --> 01:14:13.687
for selling encryption
ciphers to the Russians.

01:14:13.711 --> 01:14:14.820
I know that.

01:14:14.844 --> 01:14:16.109
But since I hit a dead end,

01:14:16.133 --> 01:14:18.660
I thought I'd look into his
NIS case file for inspiration.

01:14:18.684 --> 01:14:20.244
And that is when I saw it.

01:14:22.381 --> 01:14:24.498
Ciphers that Walker used
are over 20 years old.

01:14:24.636 --> 01:14:26.417
Not the ciphers I saw, it was this.

01:14:28.424 --> 01:14:31.031
The code that Decker
used was not a code.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.133
It's an old NIS case file number.

01:14:34.356 --> 01:14:36.761
I didn't make the connection,
because in the NIS days,

01:14:37.032 --> 01:14:38.596
we used shorter file numbers.

01:14:38.835 --> 01:14:41.835
So Decker hid his insurance
policy in plain sight:

01:14:42.461 --> 01:14:44.011
One of his old files.

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:45.934
- Pull it up.
- I can't.

01:14:46.337 --> 01:14:48.731
Nothing prior to '84 in
the system. It's in storage.

01:14:51.139 --> 01:14:54.201
- Annex. Across the street.
- You two, with me.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.650
Nice work, Agent McGee.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:03.405
McGee! Nice work.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:16.478
Here you go.

01:15:17.922 --> 01:15:19.095
Knock yourself out.

01:15:27.210 --> 01:15:29.021
Who was the last person to look in this?

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:31.187
It'll be on the log...

01:15:32.224 --> 01:15:35.444
- It was last signed out in 2001.
- Wasn't the question.

01:15:37.131 --> 01:15:39.281
An old friend asked me to do a favor.

01:15:39.403 --> 01:15:42.034
That favor involve you
leaving to take a leak?

01:15:44.534 --> 01:15:46.843
- When?
- About an hour ago.

01:15:47.036 --> 01:15:49.615
- Name.
- It was just a look, okay?

01:15:51.186 --> 01:15:52.336
Let me guess.

01:15:53.904 --> 01:15:55.354
Special Agent Gibbs?

01:15:57.715 --> 01:15:58.894
Mike Franks.

01:16:08.148 --> 01:16:09.398
Go take a leak.

01:16:09.707 --> 01:16:10.707
Sure thing.

01:16:13.053 --> 01:16:15.090
Did you know Mike Franks
was involved in this?

01:16:15.156 --> 01:16:16.156
- No.
- Yes.

01:16:16.811 --> 01:16:19.446
You want to take a moment
and get your stories straight?

01:16:19.592 --> 01:16:20.678
- Yes.
- No.

01:16:22.994 --> 01:16:25.997
That explains how Director
Shepard got out to the diner.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:30.632
- Franks was the fifth shooter.
- On Jenny's side.

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:33.072
Whose side are you on?

01:16:33.191 --> 01:16:34.026
Gibbs!

01:16:34.136 --> 01:16:36.436
You finally got your stories straight.

01:16:36.947 --> 01:16:38.111
So where's Franks?

01:16:38.849 --> 01:16:41.083
Maybe... on his way to Mexico.

01:16:41.426 --> 01:16:42.426
Why?

01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:43.669
Honor.

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:46.785
He fulfills his debt
to Director Shepard.

01:16:46.809 --> 01:16:48.607
He disappears with the file.

01:16:48.631 --> 01:16:49.672
It ends.

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:52.424
BOLO, stop him at the border.

01:16:57.274 --> 01:16:59.424
- Found her.
- We're on the way.

01:17:01.528 --> 01:17:04.590
Her name is Natasha Lenkov,
citizen of Uzbekistan.

01:17:04.998 --> 01:17:06.848
Came out of nowhere in 1999.

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:09.948
Built up a very successful
import-export business.

01:17:09.972 --> 01:17:11.749
- And before '99?
- Didn't exist.

01:17:11.773 --> 01:17:13.816
- No earlier records.
- Completely blank.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:14.894
Not a thing.

01:17:14.942 --> 01:17:17.692
Whoever our mystery woman was back
then, she is now Natasha Lenkov.

01:17:18.196 --> 01:17:20.778
Gibbs saw the photo, recognized
her, and he's gone to find her.

01:17:21.061 --> 01:17:22.530
Tying up a loose end maybe.

01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:25.825
- But how would he know how to find her?
- Maybe he's going to call her.

01:17:25.947 --> 01:17:27.897
Maybe Gibbs has an old number.

01:17:28.656 --> 01:17:30.706
No, he's not going to call her,

01:17:30.894 --> 01:17:33.644
he doesn't have to.
She's going to call him.

01:17:33.951 --> 01:17:35.813
- Viggo's cell phone.
- Here.

01:17:36.357 --> 01:17:39.053
Photographed, tagged, logged and...

01:17:40.878 --> 01:17:42.128
and missing.

01:17:55.206 --> 01:17:58.262
Think of a reason why I shouldn't
personally throw the book at you

01:17:58.286 --> 01:18:01.236
- for hindering a federal inquiry?
- 'Cause you want this to go away.

01:18:01.851 --> 01:18:03.215
Where the hell are you?

01:18:03.728 --> 01:18:05.364
- Not far.
- Franks with you?

01:18:07.602 --> 01:18:08.752
Should he be?

01:18:09.073 --> 01:18:12.705
If not, then he's on his way to
Mexico with Decker's insurance policy.

01:18:13.073 --> 01:18:14.149
Don't smile.

01:18:15.836 --> 01:18:17.586
Natasha Lenkov, real name?

01:18:18.267 --> 01:18:20.233
Svetlana Chernitskaya.

01:18:23.626 --> 01:18:24.626
And?

01:18:28.823 --> 01:18:31.641
- I'm going to have to put you on hold.
- The hell you do...

01:18:35.294 --> 01:18:36.844
What are you hearing?

01:18:40.322 --> 01:18:41.472
Russian Polka.

01:18:43.483 --> 01:18:45.029
- Hello.
- Who is this?

01:18:45.666 --> 01:18:47.445
Does it matter?

01:18:47.921 --> 01:18:50.569
I've got what you want.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.487
Where's Viggo?

01:18:52.511 --> 01:18:54.969
Dead. I need you to come see me.

01:18:55.461 --> 01:18:58.012
- Who is this?!
- Mr. Oshimaida.

01:19:00.130 --> 01:19:03.195
- Trace it.
- Got a hit on Svetlana Chernitskaya.

01:19:03.581 --> 01:19:05.091
"Hit" being the operative word.

01:19:05.213 --> 01:19:07.669
She was the handler for Anatoly Zukov,

01:19:07.693 --> 01:19:10.759
a KGB hit man who started selling
his services to the highest bidder

01:19:10.783 --> 01:19:13.182
after the Cold War ended.
Anatoly disappeared in 1999.

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:15.016
Boss.

01:19:16.525 --> 01:19:17.525
Uh, sir.

01:19:17.876 --> 01:19:21.315
Got a trace on that cell phone. It's
the South Side, narrowing it down.

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:23.501
All right, we got the street and...

01:19:23.879 --> 01:19:24.879
number.

01:19:29.235 --> 01:19:30.235
Delete it.

01:19:35.535 --> 01:19:37.081
- You want us to...
- Stay.

01:19:44.523 --> 01:19:46.964
- Status, McGee.
- Gibbs out there.

01:19:47.084 --> 01:19:49.252
Vance out there. Natasha out there.

01:19:49.316 --> 01:19:50.316
Us here.

01:19:50.341 --> 01:19:53.291
- What are we doing?
- Waiting for the fireworks.

01:20:01.336 --> 01:20:02.743
Hello, Natasha.

01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:07.017
Or do you prefer Svetlana?

01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:14.410
Not business, this is personal.

01:20:16.626 --> 01:20:18.539
It was you who killed Anatoly.

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.370
What was he to you?

01:20:26.396 --> 01:20:27.396
Everything.

01:20:28.529 --> 01:20:29.529
Why now?

01:20:30.377 --> 01:20:32.927
Because it took me
until now to find you.

01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:35.723
The night he died, a
woman came to kill you.

01:20:36.033 --> 01:20:37.183
What happened?

01:20:38.314 --> 01:20:39.764
She couldn't do it.

01:20:46.653 --> 01:20:47.653
Can you?

01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:10.007
You were going to go for
that, weren't you, probie?

01:21:12.898 --> 01:21:14.548
So Jenny couldn't do it?

01:21:15.051 --> 01:21:16.759
Girl was an artist with the steel.

01:21:17.315 --> 01:21:19.634
- Not back then.
- What changed?

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:22.287
- Me.
- She made her own choices.

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:27.231
I taught her how to accept.

01:21:28.077 --> 01:21:29.652
None of that came natural to her.

01:21:31.538 --> 01:21:32.988
Girl cared for you.

01:21:33.563 --> 01:21:34.991
Had a lot of regrets.

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:37.025
We all do.

01:21:38.931 --> 01:21:41.878
They're going to have your
ass when they find her body.

01:21:43.371 --> 01:21:45.621
They're not going to find her body.

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:07.565
Little late for a stroll.

01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.363
Is that what I think it is?

01:22:14.932 --> 01:22:16.282
It was sanctioned.

01:22:16.875 --> 01:22:18.158
Nine years ago.

01:22:20.821 --> 01:22:21.871
Your point?

01:22:22.562 --> 01:22:24.623
Decker's insurance policy, what's in it?

01:22:25.199 --> 01:22:27.126
You can read it for yourself.

01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:28.586
I'll leave it for you

01:22:29.178 --> 01:22:30.212
in my will.

01:22:33.994 --> 01:22:37.032
This has been one big
screw-up from start to finish.

01:22:48.519 --> 01:22:50.069
What do I tell Secnav?

01:22:54.405 --> 01:22:55.755
Whatever you want.

01:23:00.551 --> 01:23:04.382
These pictures are coming live to us
from our ZNN team here in Georgetown.

01:23:04.406 --> 01:23:06.795
The fire is believed to be
at the home of the director

01:23:06.919 --> 01:23:09.154
of a federal agency here in Washington.

01:23:09.178 --> 01:23:11.016
The alarm was raised by a passerby

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:14.544
who heard an explosion and saw smoke
billowing from a downstairs window...

01:23:14.568 --> 01:23:16.271
By the time the fire trucks arrived,

01:23:16.295 --> 01:23:18.540
the townhouse was fully
engulfed in flames.

01:23:18.564 --> 01:23:20.941
There has been no word yet
if anyone was inside the house

01:23:20.965 --> 01:23:22.763
at the time the fire started.

01:23:22.787 --> 01:23:24.837
Fire officials are confident...

01:23:32.969 --> 01:23:35.023
What's the story circulating on Natasha?

01:23:35.047 --> 01:23:37.440
Heard she pulled a Roman
Holiday. Ran off with her lover.

01:23:37.464 --> 01:23:40.060
- Viggo Drantyev.
- Shotgun wedding.

01:23:40.707 --> 01:23:44.411
The funeral was held this morning
for NCIS Director Jenny Shepard,

01:23:44.628 --> 01:23:47.097
who died when her Georgetown
home was destroyed by fire...

01:23:47.121 --> 01:23:49.934
I find this whole business
utterly distasteful.

01:23:50.184 --> 01:23:52.753
When leaking gas was
ignited by a pilot light.

01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:56.622
Official autopsy report found Director
Shepard died of smoke inhalation.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.531
At today's private memorial
service, one mourner,

01:23:59.555 --> 01:24:02.014
who declined to give his
name, said Director Shepard

01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:04.098
had dedicated her life
to serving her country,

01:24:04.297 --> 01:24:08.018
and would be remembered for her
courage, determination and loyalty.

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:11.397
Assistant Director Leon Vance
has been named to succeed her.

01:24:38.264 --> 01:24:41.802
Could you have Gibbs, DiNozzo,
McGee and David come up, please?

01:24:42.007 --> 01:24:43.557
Right away, Director.

01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.570
Bad few days.

01:25:04.977 --> 01:25:06.115
Officer David.

01:25:07.445 --> 01:25:10.686
The liaison position with
NCIS is being terminated.

01:25:12.166 --> 01:25:13.516
You're going home.

01:25:17.717 --> 01:25:18.731
McGee.

01:25:19.504 --> 01:25:21.926
I'm moving you across
to the Cyber Crimes Unit.

01:25:22.288 --> 01:25:25.179
You'll be working with Officer
Hollsworth, starting tomorrow.

01:25:28.028 --> 01:25:30.116
- Sir?
- You've been reassigned.

01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:33.697
Agent Afloat, USS Ronald Reagan.

01:25:34.188 --> 01:25:36.106
Pack your bags, you fly out tomorrow.

01:25:37.146 --> 01:25:38.474
Agent Gibbs.

01:25:44.923 --> 01:25:46.373
Meet your new team.
