00:14.964 --> 00:16.829
There she is.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.661
Oh.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.630
Mama, you look so wonderful.

00:24.808 --> 00:26.833
Well, Brenda Leigh, you left so early.

00:27.010 --> 00:31.140
And I was at work so late.
Y'all were asleep by the time I got home.

00:31.314 --> 00:34.579
Oh, my goodness, Charlene,
you have grown.

00:34.751 --> 00:38.847
It's Charlie now, Aunt Brenda.
No one calls me Charlene anymore.

00:39.222 --> 00:40.246
Oh.

00:41.024 --> 00:44.084
So are we going to Disneyland,
like we planned...

00:44.661 --> 00:48.324
...or do you have to stay and testify
at some horrible murder trial?

00:48.498 --> 00:50.830
Uh, no, Mama,
the defendant already confessed...

00:51.000 --> 00:54.458
...and made a deal with the DA
while Fritz and I were on our honeymoon.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.435
Now he just has to admit
to the killing in court.

00:57.607 --> 00:59.837
So it's not a trial, it's an allocution.

01:01.277 --> 01:03.006
So sorry.

01:03.413 --> 01:05.004
I'm so sorry.

01:19.062 --> 01:20.859
Run into all types, at court.

01:22.232 --> 01:25.224
Why don't y'all have a seat?
And I'll be done here, lickety-split.

01:26.469 --> 01:29.563
Ahem, I don't know what Lieutenant Tao
is so worried about.

01:29.739 --> 01:32.902
- You should be off with your family.
- I agree, commander. But, um...

01:34.778 --> 01:36.609
...since Russell Clark lawyered up...

01:36.780 --> 01:39.408
...before y'all had a chance
to interview him properly...

01:39.582 --> 01:43.541
...Lieutenant Tao asked me to be here today
and these things never take long.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.381
- Excuse me.
- All right.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.864
Dad. Dad. I'm back here.

02:03.239 --> 02:04.706
I miss you.

02:13.616 --> 02:15.880
- That's the defendant's son?
- James Clark, yes.

02:19.622 --> 02:21.112
He doesn't look schizophrenic.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.987
Oh, he looks a lot better
than the last time I interviewed him.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.253
But, uh, I think he went back on his meds.

02:26.930 --> 02:28.261
<i>All rise.</i>

02:29.065 --> 02:31.898
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen. Please be seated.

02:33.503 --> 02:37.633
So I have the pre-plea probation report here.
Both sides ready to proceed?

02:37.807 --> 02:40.139
Andrea Hobbs for the People, Judge.
We're ready.

02:40.310 --> 02:43.302
Jeb Kelly for Russell Clark.
We're ready too, Your Honor.

02:43.479 --> 02:47.506
All right, since you both agreed to waive the
formal reading of the defendant's rights...

02:47.684 --> 02:50.244
...let's just jump in, shall we?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.251
Mr. Kelly, I understand your client...

02:52.422 --> 02:55.789
...is prepared to enter a plea of guilty
to murder in the second degree.

02:55.959 --> 02:58.154
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Will the defendant rise?

03:01.865 --> 03:04.129
Let's review the statement of facts here.

03:04.300 --> 03:07.326
Mr. Clark, it says here that your son...

03:07.503 --> 03:09.266
- James?
- James. Yes, sir.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.738
Your son was receiving some
holistic treatment for schizophrenia...

03:12.909 --> 03:15.469
...from Dr. Keith Milano.
Could you explain?

03:15.645 --> 03:17.704
Yes, James was seeing
a psychiatrist...

03:17.881 --> 03:23.444
...when my mother-in-law discovered
Milano's alternative cure for schizophrenia.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.748
I was absolutely against
my son changing his therapy...

03:26.923 --> 03:30.689
...but James is over 18,
and my mother-in-law offered to pay...

03:30.860 --> 03:33.158
...so James went off of his medication...

03:33.329 --> 03:38.198
...and started in with Milano's
outrageously expensive regimen.

03:38.368 --> 03:39.767
And, uh, he got much, much worse.

03:39.936 --> 03:43.702
So on February 26th of this year,
you appeared at Dr. Milano's office...

03:43.873 --> 03:47.673
...where you confronted him about
your son's deteriorating mental condition.

03:47.844 --> 03:50.039
You attacked him and killed him.
Is that true?

03:50.580 --> 03:51.604
Yes, sir.

03:51.781 --> 03:54.648
The notes also state
that you strangled Dr. Milano. How?

03:55.618 --> 03:56.642
Sir?

03:56.819 --> 03:59.014
I'm asking you how you strangled him.

04:01.291 --> 04:03.725
I grabbed him around the neck
and I choked him to death.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.390
- With your bare hands?
- Yes, Your Honor.

04:08.731 --> 04:11.393
Okay, the defendant
has admitted his guilt.

04:11.567 --> 04:14.195
I accept his plea.
Let's move on to the impact statement.

04:14.370 --> 04:18.272
I understand that, uh, the victim's wife
and parents are here.

04:18.440 --> 04:23.242
Your Honor, excuse me, please.
Permission to approach?

04:30.053 --> 04:32.715
I would like to request
a continuance before sentencing.

04:32.889 --> 04:35.756
- What? Why?
- I agree, Mr. Kelly.

04:35.925 --> 04:38.086
- What? Why?
- Mr. Clark's statement...

04:38.261 --> 04:41.458
...about how the victim was strangled
doesn't comport with physical evidence.

04:41.631 --> 04:44.498
He says he strangled the victim
to death with his bare hands.

04:44.667 --> 04:47.602
The autopsy photo indicates
that Dr. Milano was strangled...

04:47.770 --> 04:49.362
...with an unidentified implement.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.939
I must strenuously object.
We've had a plea deal...

04:52.108 --> 04:54.872
Overruled. People have a right to nitpick.

04:55.044 --> 04:57.205
But let's get it over with.

04:57.447 --> 05:01.315
We'll all meet back here,
4:00 tomorrow afternoon...

05:01.484 --> 05:04.419
...for victim-impact statements
and to pass sentence.

05:09.625 --> 05:13.083
Why wasn't my husband's killer sentenced?
You said that this would be over.

05:13.262 --> 05:14.991
Dr. Milano, I don't know what to say.

05:15.164 --> 05:17.689
Sometimes there are unexpected delays.
Tomorrow, this...

05:17.867 --> 05:20.802
How much longer are you gonna hold
our things? It's been months.

05:20.970 --> 05:23.530
- I can't take this anymore.
- Let me review our evidence.

05:23.706 --> 05:25.970
I'll give you back what we can
tomorrow afternoon.

05:26.142 --> 05:29.043
Okay? I'm very sorry for your loss.
Pardon me.

05:31.147 --> 05:34.310
Okay, this... This isn't my fault.

05:34.484 --> 05:36.952
- Let me tell you what happened.
- That would be great.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.283
I picked up Clark and his son
from the crime scene.

05:40.456 --> 05:42.924
I brought them in for an interview.
Five minutes in...

05:43.092 --> 05:45.890
...the father says, "I did it,"
and lawyered up.

05:46.262 --> 05:49.993
Next thing I know,
the DA accepts his proffer for murder two.

05:50.166 --> 05:53.329
And I have never seen
those photos before in my life.

05:53.503 --> 05:56.870
- Chief, it's my fault, really. I should...
- It's the defendant's fault.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.702
Whether to protect his son
or to get a lighter sentence...

05:59.876 --> 06:02.436
...he definitely didn't tell the truth
in court today.

06:02.612 --> 06:06.013
And I need to know why, so excuse me.

06:06.849 --> 06:08.180
Um, I'm so sorry, y'all.

06:08.351 --> 06:10.979
There's been a problem
with the defendant's confession...

06:11.154 --> 06:13.554
...and I don't have a lot of time
to sort it out.

06:13.723 --> 06:16.487
Y'all are gonna have to go
to the happiest place on earth...

06:17.026 --> 06:20.018
...without me
and, uh, I'll meet up with you later.

06:20.196 --> 06:22.528
You're the only one
who wanted to go to Disneyland.

06:22.932 --> 06:23.956
Oh.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.897
Yeah, we have one near us
and it's really hot outside today.

06:28.104 --> 06:30.265
- We'd rather go to Venice Beach.
- Oh.

06:33.709 --> 06:35.006
It's a poem.

06:47.890 --> 06:50.654
My goodness. That boy.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.155
Argh, he drew pictures of me.

06:57.433 --> 06:58.457
<i>That's bizarre.</i>

07:00.036 --> 07:02.402
Russell Clark lied during his allocution?

07:02.905 --> 07:05.305
Either that or he forgot
how he killed the guy.

07:05.475 --> 07:07.306
Anyone ever talk to the son?

07:07.477 --> 07:09.502
Lieutenant Tao and Gabriel.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.409
But James was off his meds at the time.

07:12.582 --> 07:15.710
Not competent enough to understand
his rights as a suspect.

07:15.885 --> 07:19.844
- Not coherent enough to be a witness.
- I pulled the evidence on the Milano case.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.081
Good. Everybody grab a pile.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.423
Lieutenant Tao, would you please
join me in Interview Two?

07:32.068 --> 07:34.366
Mr. Russell Clark.
Thank you, lieutenant.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.903
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.

07:37.073 --> 07:40.702
We never met before,
and, uh, you invoked your right to counsel...

07:40.877 --> 07:43.607
...before my colleagues
got a chance to get to know you.

07:43.779 --> 07:46.407
But since the judge
accepted your guilty plea...

07:46.582 --> 07:49.176
...I thought now might be
a good time for us to chat.

07:49.852 --> 07:50.944
About what?

07:52.155 --> 07:54.715
I saw your son, James, in court today.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.620
How's he feeling these days?

07:57.360 --> 08:01.456
He's fine.
He's hoping to get back to MIT...

08:01.631 --> 08:04.794
...where he had
a full academic scholarship.

08:04.967 --> 08:07.959
And where he was arrested for...

08:08.137 --> 08:11.300
...walking around campus naked, twice.

08:11.974 --> 08:15.068
That was 16 months ago,
he's much better now.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.711
Listen.

08:16.879 --> 08:20.337
My wife died suddenly
just before James went off to college.

08:20.516 --> 08:23.314
And he just broke apart.

08:23.886 --> 08:26.946
And he's fought to pull himself
together, very hard.

08:27.823 --> 08:30.815
He also fought very hard with your daughter
when he came home.

08:30.993 --> 08:32.893
He seems awfully unstable, sir.

08:33.062 --> 08:35.394
You know all about schizophrenics,
then, huh?

08:35.565 --> 08:38.591
You think they're all violent?
You're wrong.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.293
And James doesn't have
multiple personalities either...

08:41.470 --> 08:44.928
...and he's not paranoid.
He's a disorganized schizophrenic.

08:45.107 --> 08:48.338
And when he is on his medication,
he behaves very well.

08:48.511 --> 08:51.446
This is about as far as I got with him
before he lawyered up.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.548
<i>He speaks three languages.</i>

08:53.716 --> 08:58.119
In the, uh, short statement you made after
you arrived here from Dr. Milano's office...

08:58.287 --> 09:02.246
"Dr. Milano"?
Keith Milano was no doctor.

09:02.425 --> 09:06.623
He and his wife are con artists
targeting people with incurable diseases.

09:07.163 --> 09:08.790
But according to your statement...

09:08.965 --> 09:12.332
...you had been talking and writing letters
to Keith Milano for months...

09:12.501 --> 09:14.264
...begging him to stop
your son's treatment...

09:14.437 --> 09:17.497
...and to give your mother-in-law
her money back.

09:17.673 --> 09:21.632
And you said you went to Milano's house
the night before the murder.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.211
"I appealed to his humanity...

09:24.380 --> 09:27.042
...begged him to stop acting like
he could cure my son."

09:27.216 --> 09:29.912
Then Milano asked you to
James' appointment the next day...

09:30.086 --> 09:31.917
...because he finally agreed with you.

09:32.088 --> 09:35.114
And he wanted your help
to convince James to go back on his meds.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.315
That's what you said.

09:40.096 --> 09:42.963
You people caught me with the guy
just after I'd killed him...

09:43.132 --> 09:45.794
...so I had to make up some story
about why I was there.

09:45.968 --> 09:47.492
I mean, what's the surprise?

09:47.670 --> 09:51.299
- Milano's office was ransacked.
- File cabinets turned over.

09:51.474 --> 09:53.840
Chairs upended. Holes punched in walls.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.308
I was angry.
I had to make that clear to Milano...

09:56.479 --> 09:59.471
Are you sure that your non-violent son
didn't do all that?

09:59.982 --> 10:02.075
You two arrived separately.
Maybe you showed...

10:02.251 --> 10:05.550
No, wait, wait. I got there first.
James came afterwards.

10:05.721 --> 10:08.952
Now, you want me to say that my son
committed this murder...

10:09.125 --> 10:12.754
...so that I can avoid going to prison.
And then you can ship him off...

10:12.928 --> 10:16.659
...to some underfunded mental hospital,
where he'll be treated like a freak?

10:16.832 --> 10:18.163
He'll die.

10:19.568 --> 10:22.264
And he doesn't deserve that.
He is innocent.

10:25.241 --> 10:26.265
He's innocent.

10:29.078 --> 10:32.514
If you're guilty, then why can't you tell us
how you really killed him?

10:32.682 --> 10:37.210
Because Keith Milano was not strangled
with anyone's bare hands.

10:37.653 --> 10:41.350
And we haven't found the implement
that was used to choke him to death.

10:42.258 --> 10:43.919
Why do you care so much about that?

10:45.728 --> 10:48.697
Well, besides a passing interest
in the truth, sir...

10:48.864 --> 10:51.332
...if you brought that implement
or weapon with you...

10:51.500 --> 10:54.901
...intending to kill Dr. Milano,
that is premeditated murder...

10:55.071 --> 10:57.972
...and the DA gave you a parole date
that you don't deserve.

11:00.476 --> 11:03.445
And if you didn't kill Dr. Milano...

11:03.612 --> 11:07.480
...and you're covering up for your son,
then I should really be talking to him, sir.

11:08.117 --> 11:10.551
Well, you sound confused.

11:10.720 --> 11:13.951
Tell you what? Why don't you find
this so-called implement?

11:14.690 --> 11:18.023
Especially in the time that you have left
before I'm sentenced tomorrow.

11:18.194 --> 11:20.992
You find it.
I hope it gives you some clarity.

11:21.163 --> 11:22.994
In the meantime, if I'm not mistaken...

11:23.165 --> 11:26.657
...I think I have the right
to go back to my cell. Don't I?

11:38.047 --> 11:39.173
It's not my fault.

11:41.016 --> 11:42.950
It really isn't.

11:50.860 --> 11:52.760
So since you never saw
the crime scene...

11:52.928 --> 11:55.658
...I had the office
Dr. Milano and his wife shared...

11:55.831 --> 11:57.822
...completely reconstructed in here.

11:58.501 --> 11:59.934
Oh.

12:00.102 --> 12:01.569
Excuse me.

12:01.904 --> 12:05.101
Chief, this is, um, a little smaller
than the Milanos' consulting room...

12:05.274 --> 12:07.174
...but everything's about the same scale.

12:07.343 --> 12:10.870
This is a little bigger. The room
looks smaller but we're a little bigger...

12:11.046 --> 12:12.570
Thank you. Thank you, Buzz.

12:12.748 --> 12:16.548
So both of the Milanos
worked out of the same office?

12:16.719 --> 12:18.050
Kept the overhead low.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.745
Keith Milano dealt mostly
with the patients.

12:20.923 --> 12:22.550
His wife mixed the meds.

12:22.725 --> 12:26.491
And we tagged everything
with Russell Clark's fingerprints. See here?

12:26.662 --> 12:30.189
There was nothing from the office
matches the marks on Milano's neck.

12:30.699 --> 12:32.257
Okay. What about money?

12:32.435 --> 12:36.462
Well, ugh, we found, uh, $600
in Dr. Milano's desk drawer...

12:36.639 --> 12:40.973
...and his wife had $2000 cash
in her little black bag here.

12:41.143 --> 12:44.738
Oh. So robbery's out.

12:44.914 --> 12:46.711
The receptionist had the day off.

12:46.882 --> 12:50.511
The other Dr. Milano, the wife,
was out delivering their so-called meds.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.847
For the record, neither Milano is an MD.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.048
Their business license lists them
as holistic dieticians.

12:56.225 --> 12:58.659
Which made it easy to grab their, uh...

12:58.828 --> 13:01.922
Sorry. Grab their files.
Take a look at this, chief.

13:02.798 --> 13:06.131
Five thousand for a month's supply
of their voodoo treatments.

13:06.302 --> 13:10.534
Altogether, the Milanos were pulling in
about 300,000 a month.

13:10.706 --> 13:13.436
Desperate people pay desperate prices.

13:16.245 --> 13:18.509
Russell Clark said that
he arrived before his son.

13:18.681 --> 13:21.582
- Any way to verify that?
- Uh, no witnesses.

13:21.750 --> 13:24.947
No one else showed up at the crime scene
the entire time you were there?

13:25.120 --> 13:29.181
Ah, well, the guy in the office next door
who called in to complain about...

13:29.358 --> 13:31.223
...holes being punched through his wall.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.861
What about the patients
who came to see the Milanos...

13:34.029 --> 13:37.829
...before the Clarks,
and the ones who came after?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.026
The Milanos were supposedly two
of the most successful witch doctors...

13:41.203 --> 13:43.637
...in all of Los Angeles
and there were no other patients...

13:43.806 --> 13:45.330
...the entire rest of the day?

13:45.508 --> 13:48.204
- These are all good questions, chief.
- Well, thank you, detective.

13:48.377 --> 13:50.208
By the time we would have asked them...

13:50.379 --> 13:53.371
...Mr. Clark had lawyered up
and made a deal with the DA.

13:53.549 --> 13:54.743
Now, that's exactly right.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.045
Plus, Clark was telling the truth
about some things.

13:58.220 --> 14:01.018
We have letters here
from him to Dr. Milano...

14:01.190 --> 14:04.887
...going back two months before the murder,
begging him to stop treating his son.

14:05.694 --> 14:09.596
- Does sound like motive, chief.
- But why won't he tell us how he did it?

14:09.765 --> 14:12.199
I want to know what happened
to the other patients...

14:12.368 --> 14:13.699
...the day Milano was killed.

14:13.869 --> 14:16.030
And where his receptionist was, please.

14:16.205 --> 14:18.673
Oh, and I wanna talk
to the suspect's son, James.

14:18.841 --> 14:20.331
We know how to get ahold of him?

14:20.509 --> 14:22.704
I'm working on getting James
in here for you.

14:22.878 --> 14:27.747
The kid freaks out easily. Even on his meds,
he might still be a little confused.

14:27.917 --> 14:31.683
Oh, and he doesn't like confined spaces.
Interviewing him won't be easy.

14:31.854 --> 14:33.481
Talk him into sitting down with me.

14:33.656 --> 14:36.454
And I'll worry about
how to get him to cooperate later.

14:36.625 --> 14:40.356
Chief, this is the original interview
that Lieutenant Tao did with James Clark.

14:41.163 --> 14:42.790
Thank you.

14:43.566 --> 14:45.864
Good job, everyone. Good job.

14:48.337 --> 14:51.704
Thank you, Willie Ray.
The chicken and dumplings look wonderful.

14:52.675 --> 14:55.041
- Charlene, if you would...
- Charlie.

14:55.644 --> 14:59.045
Charlie, if you would please
put that phone down while we eat...

14:59.214 --> 15:02.274
...that would be the ladylike thing to do.
- One second.

15:05.888 --> 15:09.221
So, Charlie, how are you liking
Los Angeles?

15:11.327 --> 15:14.421
I'd tell you, but I'm really not allowed
to have my own opinions.

15:14.597 --> 15:18.089
- Grandma?
- Ugh, she loves it here.

15:18.267 --> 15:21.964
And that reminds me,
your father and I thought...

15:22.137 --> 15:24.298
Well, Clay and I discussed this...

15:24.473 --> 15:28.466
...and we thought it might be, oh, fun...

15:28.644 --> 15:31.841
...if Charlene... Charlie...

15:32.014 --> 15:35.814
...could stay with y'all
for the rest of the summer.

15:39.388 --> 15:40.548
Really?

15:40.723 --> 15:43.521
What on earth made you think that?

15:43.692 --> 15:44.852
My parents hate me now.

15:45.327 --> 15:47.318
Your parents do not hate you, Charlene.

15:47.496 --> 15:50.192
- Charlie.
- They love you very much.

15:52.935 --> 15:53.993
They hate my friends.

15:54.169 --> 15:56.433
They hated the guy I was dating
till he dumped me.

15:56.605 --> 15:57.833
They spy on me.

15:58.707 --> 16:01.767
- What are you doing?
- I asked you to put away the phone...

16:01.944 --> 16:05.209
...and I'm not used to asking
that kind of thing twice.

16:05.381 --> 16:09.750
I'm sure Brenda and Fritz
don't use their cell phones at the table.

16:11.286 --> 16:12.412
She's right about that.

16:12.588 --> 16:14.852
See, during dinnertime, we usually...

16:20.162 --> 16:21.720
Well, try to, uh...

16:25.868 --> 16:29.031
Try to ignore the outside world
for a few minutes.

16:29.638 --> 16:33.597
Usually we do that, but, um,
I really need to set up this interview.

16:33.776 --> 16:37.143
And it'll just take one moment,
I promise. Pardon me.

16:37.846 --> 16:41.475
Hello? Yes. Hello?

16:41.650 --> 16:43.311
Your Aunt Brenda is working.

16:44.053 --> 16:46.283
And she excused herself from the table.

16:46.455 --> 16:50.824
It's okay. I'm used to adults making rules
for me they don't live by themselves.

16:51.994 --> 16:55.225
Thank you so much, sergeant.
All right. Bye, now.

16:55.397 --> 16:56.625
I'm so sorry about that.

16:57.132 --> 17:02.502
Um, Charlie, you remember that boy
who drew pictures of you today in court?

17:02.671 --> 17:04.332
- Yeah.
- Want to see what he's like...

17:04.506 --> 17:06.234
...when he's off his medication?

17:07.108 --> 17:08.576
- Okay, yeah.
- Good.

17:08.743 --> 17:12.737
Uh, why don't you grab your dinner,
and I'll meet you in the bedroom, okay?

17:13.482 --> 17:15.074
Just be a minute.

17:16.752 --> 17:18.413
Pardon me.

17:18.587 --> 17:21.852
<i>Her, here? No.</i>

17:24.259 --> 17:29.595
Ahem, okay. What's really
going on here, exactly?

17:30.566 --> 17:35.060
Charlene has decided she doesn't have to
obey her parents anymore.

17:35.237 --> 17:37.705
- Mm-hm.
- And it's tearing Bobby and Joyce apart.

17:37.873 --> 17:40.865
So Clay and I agreed
to take her for the summer.

17:41.677 --> 17:47.309
Only Clay will not exercise
one ounce of discipline with her.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.316
And her friends keep coming over
to our house...

17:50.486 --> 17:52.977
...and we don't know...

17:53.155 --> 17:55.020
I am not able...

18:00.529 --> 18:02.622
She is uncontrollable right now.

18:02.798 --> 18:05.392
Yeah, well, when you say
"uncontrollable"...

18:05.567 --> 18:07.034
...what do you mean?

18:07.202 --> 18:08.601
<i>No, no, no!</i>

18:08.771 --> 18:10.295
<i>No, no, no!</i>

18:10.472 --> 18:12.804
<i>Wouldn't talk to me.
Wouldn't talk to me.</i>

18:12.975 --> 18:14.670
<i>Wouldn't talk to me.</i>

18:16.378 --> 18:18.073
<i>Who wouldn't talk to you, James?</i>

18:18.247 --> 18:20.181
<i>Dr. Milano?</i>

18:20.415 --> 18:22.747
<i>- Hey, where you going, James?
- To Grandmother's house.</i>

18:22.918 --> 18:26.820
<i>Oh, no. You probably should
sit back down. Sit back down.</i>

18:27.556 --> 18:29.922
- That can't be the same kid.
- It is.

18:30.459 --> 18:32.188
Wow.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.988
What happened to your hand, James?

18:34.163 --> 18:36.222
Looks like you hurt yourself.

18:37.733 --> 18:40.327
Your grandmother dropped you off
at Dr. Milano's office.

18:40.502 --> 18:45.166
You went upstairs into the waiting room.
Was your father there yet?

18:45.340 --> 18:48.434
I don't know. It was dark.

18:48.911 --> 18:52.938
It was dark in the room.
But I saw them, and she was gone.

18:53.749 --> 18:57.185
Over the river and through the woods,
to Grandmother's house we go.

18:57.352 --> 19:02.016
- What do you mean, "it was dark," James?
- It was dark this time in the office.

19:02.191 --> 19:05.092
And there were no questions.
My friends kept telling me to run.

19:05.260 --> 19:07.660
But I couldn't because he shut the door.

19:07.830 --> 19:10.390
And we were all trapped inside.
He wouldn't answer my questions.

19:10.566 --> 19:15.094
And Dad told me to sit back down.

19:16.038 --> 19:18.029
And he wouldn't open the door.

19:18.207 --> 19:20.903
The door is shut. Open the door.
You have to open the door.

19:21.076 --> 19:23.067
My friends want out. They want out.

19:23.245 --> 19:26.942
So your father was in the room
with Dr. Milano when you arrived?

19:27.115 --> 19:28.946
Looking, looking in the dark.

19:29.318 --> 19:32.754
- Why was it dark, James?
- No light, no sun.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.583
Lids over the eyes of the building.
And he's looking.

19:37.392 --> 19:40.293
- What were you looking for?
- He was looking!

19:40.462 --> 19:43.090
He was looking and he won't
open the door while he looks!

19:43.265 --> 19:45.130
Open the door!
You have to open the door!

19:45.300 --> 19:47.063
- Open the door! Open the door!
- Hey!

19:47.836 --> 19:49.326
<i>Calm down!</i>

19:51.139 --> 19:55.599
So did James do it instead of the dad?
Did he strangle the guy?

19:55.777 --> 19:57.677
I don't know,
but whether he did or not...

19:57.846 --> 20:00.406
...he may have told us
that the murder was premeditated.

20:00.582 --> 20:03.949
- When did he say that?
- When he said the office was dark.

20:16.365 --> 20:19.596
No, Bobby, it's no trouble at all.

20:19.768 --> 20:22.931
I just wanted to make sure
that Charlie's being here...

20:24.172 --> 20:25.571
Okay, Charlene, then.

20:25.741 --> 20:28.369
That Charlene's being here
was something that you wanted.

20:28.543 --> 20:30.977
I promised your mother
we'd try it for a week or so.

20:31.146 --> 20:34.775
And I'm trying to get us out of it. No!

20:35.250 --> 20:39.243
Mama should have told you
that she was bringing Charlene out here.

20:39.421 --> 20:41.252
My goodness. I don't understand her.

20:41.423 --> 20:45.587
I mean, you're her parents.
It's like kidnapping, really.

20:47.863 --> 20:50.525
Oh, no, no.
Bobby, don't be embarrassed.

20:50.699 --> 20:54.829
Look, if there's anyone who can figure out
what's going on with Charlene, it'll be me.

20:55.270 --> 20:56.965
Where, where, where are my keys?

20:57.606 --> 21:00.006
I already know
what's going on with Charlie.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.040
Shh...

21:02.611 --> 21:05.512
No. No, no, no.
You tell Joyce not to worry.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.842
This is all gonna work out.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.484
Okay. All right, I love you too.

21:11.253 --> 21:13.084
All right. Bye, now.

21:14.122 --> 21:17.023
Bobby was no help at all.
He's probably lying...

21:17.192 --> 21:20.559
...and knew exactly what Mama
was planning all along.

21:20.729 --> 21:24.859
He can't handle anything that interferes
with his martini schedule.

21:27.169 --> 21:28.796
What did Mama say
was going on Charlene?

21:28.971 --> 21:32.134
- Charlie.
- Charlie. Charlie. Whoever she is.

21:32.841 --> 21:34.741
Well, according to your mother...

21:34.910 --> 21:37.708
...Charlie's parents
think she's been smoking pot.

21:37.879 --> 21:40.507
And she may have had sex
with her ex-boyfriend.

21:40.682 --> 21:44.379
And she's making some
not very good friends.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.382
And you agreed to let her stay here?

21:48.890 --> 21:51.825
Well, if she needs us...

21:51.994 --> 21:54.861
And maybe...

21:55.030 --> 21:58.557
...you know, we could think of it
as something of a dry run.

21:58.734 --> 22:02.067
You know, how we are
with a child around the house.

22:02.237 --> 22:05.695
She's not a child anymore.
She's a teenage girl.

22:05.874 --> 22:08.308
Bobby's just gonna have to
get it through his head...

22:08.477 --> 22:11.207
...that boys are naturally
gonna be attracted to her.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.309
- Oh.
- What?

22:16.852 --> 22:19.878
I already know someone
who's attracted to her.

22:20.756 --> 22:25.193
And if Charlie's gonna hang around here,
she might as well make herself useful.

22:28.263 --> 22:30.322
Charlie, you're up.

22:30.499 --> 22:32.626
How would you like to go to work
with me today?

22:32.801 --> 22:34.769
And watch another interview
with that boy?

22:35.504 --> 22:40.567
- Really?
- Brenda, we're planning a day of culture.

22:40.742 --> 22:42.573
And I don't think your brother Bobby...

22:42.744 --> 22:46.236
...would want Charlene to be spending time
around a murder investigation.

22:46.415 --> 22:49.282
Grandma, I have asked
you a 100 million times...

22:49.451 --> 22:52.284
...to stop calling me Charlene.
It drives me crazy.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.649
Oh, honey, I forget.

22:54.823 --> 22:58.725
Mama, look, if Charlie's gonna be staying
here, then murder is part of the deal.

22:58.894 --> 23:01.226
Brenda, she is not dressed
to go to work with you.

23:01.396 --> 23:03.023
Fine. Why don't we let her decide?

23:03.198 --> 23:05.758
Charlie, which would you rather,
museums with Grandma...

23:05.934 --> 23:08.596
...or schizophrenic murder suspects
with your Aunt Brenda?

23:09.137 --> 23:11.401
- Bye, Grandma.
- Okay.

23:11.973 --> 23:16.410
Well, I've got a terrible deadline, so
we'll meet back up again for dinner, okay?

23:16.578 --> 23:17.943
Love you. Bye.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.813
Yummy biscuit. Yummy. Yummy, yummy.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.814
So we looked up all the patients
on Milano's schedule.

23:28.990 --> 23:32.653
Of the nine people originally set to see him
on the day he was murdered...

23:32.828 --> 23:36.059
...three have died, cancer.
Four are in hospice care.

23:36.231 --> 23:38.859
Their treatments are less successful
than their business.

23:39.034 --> 23:42.299
Then there was the guy who was
supposed to come in after James Clark...

23:42.471 --> 23:43.768
...Bob Geddes, MS.

23:43.939 --> 23:47.272
He said his appointment was canceled
by none other than Milano himself.

23:47.809 --> 23:51.006
- The victim told him not to come?
- Receptionist said the same thing.

23:51.179 --> 23:54.444
Milano called her the night before
and told her to take the day off.

23:55.016 --> 23:58.850
So Milano canceled all the potential
witnesses to his own murder...

23:59.020 --> 24:02.751
...and left himself alone to meet
a schizophrenic boy and his angry father.

24:02.924 --> 24:03.982
Why would he do that?

24:05.494 --> 24:07.359
James Clark
wouldn't get on the elevator.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.622
Sanchez is reading his rights
as they come up.

24:09.798 --> 24:12.028
- He's almost here.
- Thank you.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.758
I've got picture and sound.

24:14.569 --> 24:18.437
Okay, uh, Lieutenant Tao,
please make sure that both doors are open.

24:18.607 --> 24:20.632
Let's see how well James does
with glass.

24:21.309 --> 24:22.936
Excuse me.

24:24.346 --> 24:26.371
- Here we are.
- Yes, we're here.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.381
I can go places by myself now.
I have a bus map.

24:30.852 --> 24:33.821
- And did you find me well-behaved?
- Oh, yeah. You were great.

24:33.989 --> 24:36.150
Chief Johnson, this is James Clark.

24:36.324 --> 24:39.293
- Hello...
- Thank you for inviting me to visit.

24:39.461 --> 24:41.326
- It's very nice of you.
- Oh.

24:41.496 --> 24:44.488
You're welcome.
Um, we almost met in court.

24:44.666 --> 24:49.069
Yes. Yes, I remember your hair
and your voice. It's odd.

24:50.939 --> 24:53.908
Well, thank you. That's...

24:54.576 --> 24:55.770
Thank you.

24:55.944 --> 24:58.742
So, James, um, would you like to sit down
for a few minutes...

24:58.914 --> 25:01.747
...and talk to me in my office...

25:02.851 --> 25:05.479
...about what happened with Dr. Milano?
- Oh.

25:06.855 --> 25:10.814
- Yes, I can do that. Yes.
- Good.

25:10.992 --> 25:14.826
So, James, I hear that
you're fluent in three languages.

25:14.996 --> 25:17.794
One of the voices I hear speaks French.

25:17.966 --> 25:19.900
It's a little schizophrenic humor.

25:20.068 --> 25:23.367
I can make jokes, so people
don't feel self-conscious about me.

25:23.538 --> 25:26.905
My father taught me that. Yes.

25:27.075 --> 25:30.067
- Do you remember my niece, Charlie?
- Um...

25:30.679 --> 25:32.772
Thanks for the pictures you drew of me
yesterday.

25:33.315 --> 25:36.944
Oh, you're very welcome.

25:37.118 --> 25:39.450
People should draw pictures of you
all the time.

25:40.655 --> 25:44.284
Okay, let's come on here into my office.

25:44.459 --> 25:46.984
You can have a seat right here.

25:49.097 --> 25:52.555
<i>And here, have some chocolate.</i>

25:52.734 --> 25:54.793
Is that chair okay for you, James?

25:54.970 --> 25:56.961
It's a very nice chair, yes.

25:57.138 --> 25:59.402
- And I can eat your chocolate?
- You may.

26:00.709 --> 26:03.872
And, um, I think I'll have some too.

26:05.847 --> 26:09.613
So, James, do you remember much
about the day...

26:09.784 --> 26:13.345
...that Dr. Milano was murdered?
- Oh, yes.

26:13.521 --> 26:15.921
Not only do I remember things
that happened...

26:16.091 --> 26:19.026
...I can also remember things
that didn't happen.

26:19.261 --> 26:22.992
<i>But I'm not good with chronology.
That's the order of things.</i>

26:23.164 --> 26:26.156
And sometimes, I dream awake.

26:26.334 --> 26:29.497
But otherwise, I have a great memory.

26:36.211 --> 26:38.907
<i>So, uh, you were dropped off...</i>

26:39.080 --> 26:42.413
<i>...and you went upstairs
to the Milanos' waiting room.</i>

26:42.584 --> 26:44.347
And then what happened?

26:44.853 --> 26:46.582
There was no one else there.

26:46.755 --> 26:50.623
The lady who usually sits behind
the sliding glass window was gone.

26:51.126 --> 26:52.923
Or maybe she was invisible.

26:54.162 --> 26:56.858
And Dr. Milano called me in.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.966
- Dr. Milano called for you?
- Yes.

26:59.134 --> 27:02.262
And I went in the office,
even though I didn't want to.

27:02.437 --> 27:05.031
It was dark, and then all the blinds
were pulled down.

27:06.141 --> 27:07.540
The blinds were usually up?

27:11.579 --> 27:14.446
Yes, but not on that day.

27:16.251 --> 27:17.809
And the lights were off too.

27:18.620 --> 27:21.589
And Dr. Milano sat behind his desk.

27:22.791 --> 27:25.555
And he wouldn't answer any questions.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.628
I moved up next to him
because all my friends were telling me...

27:28.797 --> 27:32.198
- Excuse me, your friends?
- That's what I call them.

27:32.367 --> 27:35.495
When I'm off my medication,
I have friends.

27:35.670 --> 27:39.401
My father says they're not good for me.
My friends will keep me from...

27:39.574 --> 27:43.032
...getting back into college and managing
my mind. Have to get rid of them.

27:43.211 --> 27:45.372
Hallucinations. No hallucinations.

27:51.686 --> 27:56.089
Would it be considered bad behavior
to ask for another chocolate?

27:57.192 --> 27:58.921
Not at all.

28:03.898 --> 28:08.426
James, was your father there
with you and Dr. Milano in the dark?

28:09.037 --> 28:13.701
Well, he was either there already or after.

28:13.875 --> 28:15.604
But he was yelling and mad.

28:16.578 --> 28:18.603
He trapped us
while he searched the office.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.241
- By closing the door?
- Both doors, yes.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.951
And I was afraid and upset. And I...

28:26.121 --> 28:28.385
So you punched the wall?

28:28.556 --> 28:32.083
Yes. I'm sorry.
I would never do that today.

28:34.229 --> 28:37.665
James, you said that your father
was searching for something.

28:37.832 --> 28:39.129
Do you know why?

28:42.370 --> 28:43.894
Because Dr. Milano was dead.

28:45.006 --> 28:48.772
So, Dr. Milano called you
into the office...

28:48.943 --> 28:50.740
...and you sat by him...

28:52.580 --> 28:55.640
...and then he was dead,
and then your father came in...

28:55.817 --> 28:57.978
...and started searching for something?

28:58.153 --> 29:01.088
Yes. Yes.
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.983
Are you sure it's okay
for us to discuss it?

29:08.396 --> 29:11.991
Yes, it's absolutely okay. I promise you.

29:14.569 --> 29:16.730
Do you know how Dr. Milano died?

29:20.742 --> 29:24.974
I was standing next to the desk
and my father... My...

29:26.481 --> 29:28.813
My father wanted to know...

29:29.284 --> 29:32.048
Come on, James, you can tell me.
What did your father want to know?

29:32.220 --> 29:35.348
My father wanted to know
why I strangled the doctor...

29:35.523 --> 29:37.252
...and how I did it.

29:38.393 --> 29:39.985
Jeez Louise.

29:40.161 --> 29:42.823
How many people are gonna
confess to this murder, anyway?

29:42.997 --> 29:45.966
<i>And what did you say to him,
your father?</i>

29:46.134 --> 29:50.195
That I did it with one of my socks. I took
off a shoe, and I took off one of my socks.

29:50.371 --> 29:53.431
I strangled Dr. Milano with it
and then I put the sock back on.

29:54.075 --> 29:57.909
But my father kept looking for things
and wouldn't let us go.

29:58.079 --> 29:59.979
He told me to stop talking to my friends.

30:00.148 --> 30:02.514
That's when I punched in the wall
and cried a little bit.

30:02.684 --> 30:04.345
Why did you cry, James?

30:07.255 --> 30:10.224
Because my father
used to be so proud of me.

30:10.792 --> 30:13.056
And now if I don't behave...

30:16.064 --> 30:17.725
<i>If I can't...</i>

30:19.200 --> 30:21.998
I must behave very well,
or I will be sent away.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.872
I must make people
comfortable by smiling...

30:26.708 --> 30:29.142
...and I can do that.

30:29.310 --> 30:33.974
But also, I can make mistakes.
I can slip up.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.209
So I must manage my drugs...

30:37.485 --> 30:38.747
<i>...get rid of my friends...</i>

30:39.454 --> 30:43.788
...and try to behave,
or I might be sent away.

30:46.528 --> 30:52.831
But I think I am behaving
very well today. Yes?

30:56.237 --> 30:59.695
Yes. Yes, today you behaved
very well, James.

31:11.753 --> 31:14.381
All right, so...

31:14.589 --> 31:16.716
And now what should we talk about?

31:24.899 --> 31:27.561
<i>But I took off a shoe,
and I took off a sock...</i>

31:27.735 --> 31:29.965
<i>...and I strangled Dr. Milano with it.</i>

31:30.138 --> 31:32.038
Couldn't the kid be found not guilty?

31:32.206 --> 31:35.733
No way. James Clark went off his meds
after attacking his sister...

31:35.910 --> 31:38.572
...knowing he could be dangerous,
against doctor's orders.

31:38.746 --> 31:41.544
That's reckless endangerment
and I'll try his ass for murder.

31:41.716 --> 31:45.174
James' confession isn't supported
by the physical evidence...

31:45.353 --> 31:46.615
...any more than his dad's.

31:47.021 --> 31:50.115
Milano was strangled with something
heavier than a sock...

31:50.291 --> 31:53.658
...and if you had just bothered to ask
about the weapon six months ago...

31:53.828 --> 31:56.456
...we wouldn't be here today.
- I admit I settled fast.

31:56.631 --> 31:58.861
But here we are,
and as far as I'm concerned...

31:59.033 --> 32:02.127
...come 4:00, I'm going through
with the deal with Russell Clark...

32:02.303 --> 32:04.669
...or arraigning his son for murder.
You decide.

32:04.839 --> 32:07.103
Look, the father had motive.
He had opportunity.

32:07.275 --> 32:09.334
Is there no way we can consider,
just for a second...

32:09.510 --> 32:12.411
...that he may have been telling the truth
from the beginning?

32:18.820 --> 32:20.014
You're absolutely right.

32:20.888 --> 32:23.755
Russell Clark was telling the truth
from the beginning.

32:24.459 --> 32:26.552
And if he was...

32:26.728 --> 32:29.492
Uh... Excuse me. Pardon me.

32:34.802 --> 32:36.770
Chief, what do you want us to do here?

32:36.938 --> 32:40.305
Bring in Behavioral Science
and examine this kid? Arrest him for...

32:40.475 --> 32:43.467
No, no, no.
Don't arrest him unless he tries to leave.

32:43.645 --> 32:46.307
Make sure that Lieutenant Tao
stays with him in my office.

32:46.481 --> 32:47.743
Dr. Milano's widow called.

32:47.915 --> 32:50.543
She's on her way down here
to pick up the stuff we took.

32:50.718 --> 32:52.709
Don't give her a thing until I get back.

32:52.887 --> 32:55.879
Get another removal order
to have Russell Clark brought back.

32:56.057 --> 32:59.083
We're gonna have to get
the father and son in the same room.

32:59.260 --> 33:00.659
- Yeah.
- What about me?

33:00.828 --> 33:04.559
Uh, just stay here and play
computer games or something...

33:04.732 --> 33:07.826
...and wave to James every now and then.
You're doing a great job.

33:08.002 --> 33:09.162
Great job of what?

33:09.337 --> 33:11.669
Chief. Chief, where are you going?

33:11.839 --> 33:15.036
- Shopping.
- Shopping?

33:32.427 --> 33:35.021
I'm compelled to show the tape
of James confessing...

33:35.196 --> 33:37.664
...to the defense before sentencing,
and I can't wait.

33:37.832 --> 33:41.666
Is Chief Johnson going to come back and
interview Clark ever? What are we doing?

33:41.836 --> 33:43.895
What you should have done
six months ago.

33:48.676 --> 33:50.871
Chief, James is in your office.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.678
His dad is in Interview Two.

33:52.847 --> 33:55.816
The morgue sent over
these blown-up photos of Milano's neck.

33:55.983 --> 33:57.814
- I guess you asked for them.
- Thank you.

33:58.820 --> 34:00.082
Oh, there you are, finally.

34:01.122 --> 34:05.616
Um, I need Lieutenant Tao in Interview One.
I've got minutes.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.454
We have another problem.

34:10.965 --> 34:12.989
Apparently, you promised Dr. Milano...

34:13.167 --> 34:16.034
...that she could collect her belongings
from the crime scene.

34:16.204 --> 34:19.639
I'm so sorry, Dr. Milano. We haven't
wrapped up your husband's murder yet.

34:19.806 --> 34:24.402
Just tell me this, then. How long are you
legally entitled to hold our things?

34:25.179 --> 34:29.206
Uh, you know what, I have just enough time
to return some of your things right now.

34:29.382 --> 34:31.373
Why don't you come right this way?

34:32.487 --> 34:34.978
And we will, uh, deal with the rest later.

34:35.156 --> 34:38.989
Oh, you brought boxes. Good.
Lieutenant Tao. Okay.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.525
Inside here.

34:44.132 --> 34:45.963
Oh, my God.

34:46.367 --> 34:50.428
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I had forgotten that it's...

34:51.839 --> 34:53.830
We'll hurry this along.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.206
<i>We'll just, uh, do this quickly.</i>

34:58.379 --> 35:00.813
<i>Let's just get some of your things
together here.</i>

35:02.550 --> 35:03.812
<i>Why don't you hand me this?</i>

35:06.487 --> 35:09.615
Here are your, uh, patients' files.
You're gonna need those.

35:09.791 --> 35:12.589
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.955
<i>This must be horrible, just... Just horrible.</i>

35:15.129 --> 35:16.619
<i>- It is awful.
- What is she doing?</i>

35:16.798 --> 35:18.789
- What is going on?
- Hold on a minute.

35:18.966 --> 35:22.402
<i>Russell Clark destroyed my life,
and he admitted to killing my husband.</i>

35:22.570 --> 35:25.004
<i>So I don't understand
why he's not in prison.</i>

35:25.173 --> 35:30.770
Well, it's mostly because, uh, Mr. Clark
didn't know certain facts about the murder...

35:30.945 --> 35:32.708
...that the killer would.
- Like what?

35:32.880 --> 35:35.440
Like how he strangled your husband,
for one thing.

35:36.751 --> 35:40.448
- Obviously, they fought.
- No one heard anything.

35:40.621 --> 35:44.557
Until James punched through
these really thin walls...

35:44.725 --> 35:47.956
...here, into the next office.
Your husband never called for help.

35:48.129 --> 35:50.996
No, we think that most of the mess
that was created here...

35:51.165 --> 35:52.826
...happened after the murder.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.525
Clark entered the office
you shared with your husband.

35:55.703 --> 35:59.867
He saw his son standing over the body,
so he started to look for the implement...

36:00.041 --> 36:03.636
...James used to choke your husband.
That's why the office is like this.

36:03.811 --> 36:05.244
But the weapon wasn't here.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.209
Where'd it go, then?

36:08.616 --> 36:12.746
Well, I'm guessing that you
must've taken it with you.

36:14.021 --> 36:16.751
<i>Excuse me? Taken it with me? How?</i>

36:16.924 --> 36:19.085
<i>By removing the chain...</i>

36:19.260 --> 36:23.697
...that comes as a strap
on your handbag.

36:25.766 --> 36:27.700
I was able to find one just like it.

36:28.636 --> 36:32.504
And my mama has something like this.
Very versatile.

36:32.673 --> 36:34.937
Can be used as a purse...

36:36.677 --> 36:38.008
...a clutch...

36:38.179 --> 36:39.771
...or, in your case...

36:44.418 --> 36:45.578
...a murder weapon.

36:45.753 --> 36:47.243
But that...

36:49.457 --> 36:52.688
You're not suggesting
that I killed my husband, are you?

36:52.860 --> 36:55.192
- Oh, I think I am.
- But why would I do that?

36:55.363 --> 36:57.126
For the money, I'm sure.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.391
Russell Clark was telling the truth
all along.

36:59.567 --> 37:01.865
He had succeeded
in convincing the doctor...

37:02.036 --> 37:04.061
...to stop his treatment for James.

37:04.238 --> 37:06.798
- So Russell Clark didn't have a motive.
- But you did.

37:07.708 --> 37:10.768
Because not only had your husband
decided to stop treating James...

37:10.945 --> 37:14.176
...he was canceling all your patients,
shutting your entire practice.

37:14.348 --> 37:17.476
Maybe even returning some of
the hundreds of thousands of dollars...

37:17.652 --> 37:20.120
...y'all conned from sick people
on their way to the grave.

37:20.288 --> 37:22.722
<i>- You don't understand.
- Oh, my God.</i>

37:22.890 --> 37:25.552
We'll have more confessions
than we know what to do with.

37:25.726 --> 37:28.251
Just have a quick seat here.

37:29.096 --> 37:30.757
Just...

37:37.838 --> 37:38.862
We have a witness.

37:41.108 --> 37:42.803
James Clark.

37:44.946 --> 37:48.279
James Clark said Dr. Milano
called him into the waiting room...

37:48.449 --> 37:50.178
...but your husband was already dead.

37:50.351 --> 37:54.720
So the only Dr. Milano who could have
called him into the office was you.

37:54.889 --> 37:57.653
And before he came in,
you went out the back door.

37:57.825 --> 37:59.452
No, no. Wait. Wait.

37:59.627 --> 38:03.529
Keith and I were helping people
that had terrible health problems.

38:03.698 --> 38:09.261
And because of Russell Clark,
Keith was going to abandon them.

38:10.438 --> 38:11.996
See, Keith...

38:15.176 --> 38:20.808
...he said that we were charlatans, frauds.

38:23.084 --> 38:25.780
Yes, we argued about him
giving the money back.

38:25.953 --> 38:31.220
And, yes, I tried to stop him,
and our argument, it got physical, and...

38:32.560 --> 38:36.462
...somehow, I don't know
how it happened exactly...

38:37.298 --> 38:40.392
...but the chain on my purse,
it wrapped around his neck...

38:40.568 --> 38:44.299
...and I pulled...

38:46.340 --> 38:49.173
He pulled...

38:52.947 --> 38:58.249
It was... It was an accident.
I swear, it's the truth.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.216
I just find that so hard to believe.

39:00.388 --> 39:02.879
No, that is the truth, though.
I promise you.

39:03.257 --> 39:05.418
No, I don't... I don't think it is.

39:08.029 --> 39:11.055
See, James said that when he
came into the office it was dark...

39:11.232 --> 39:14.565
...when it had always been light before,
with the blinds open.

39:14.735 --> 39:17.431
A point I confirmed
with Mr. Bob Geddes...

39:17.605 --> 39:22.167
...one of your few long-term patients
I was able to contact without a Ouija board.

39:22.710 --> 39:25.873
As you can see,
from the photos of the crime scene...

39:26.047 --> 39:28.277
...the shades are closed,
lights are turned off.

39:28.449 --> 39:32.283
Because you didn't want anyone to see
you strangling your husband to death.

39:33.254 --> 39:37.247
And that's premeditation, ma'am,
which means murder in the first degree.

39:40.694 --> 39:42.821
Lieutenant Tao,
would you please do the honors?

39:44.799 --> 39:49.031
Robin Milano, you're under arrest
for the murder of your husband.

39:49.203 --> 39:52.866
- You have the right to remain silent.
- Oh, my. This confession is no good.

39:53.441 --> 39:57.377
Chief Johnson didn't advise Dr. Milano
of her rights before questioning her.

39:57.545 --> 39:59.877
I didn't hear the chief ask a question.

40:00.047 --> 40:03.813
- Did you, lieutenant?
- Not one. As far as the law is concerned...

40:03.984 --> 40:06.782
...the good doctor here
made a spontaneous confession...

40:06.954 --> 40:08.979
...which should make you very happy.

40:09.156 --> 40:10.953
It's called "strategy."

40:11.125 --> 40:14.720
And the next time you wanna close a case
without asking any questions...

40:15.930 --> 40:18.421
...this is the way to do it.

40:18.966 --> 40:20.866
<i>Do you understand?</i>

40:30.044 --> 40:31.306
Good evening, everyone.

40:31.479 --> 40:36.439
Oh. Willie Ray, what a pleasant surprise.

40:36.617 --> 40:39.609
Oh, it is so good to see you.

40:39.787 --> 40:42.722
Oh, Lieutenant Provenza,
don't you look dashing?

40:42.890 --> 40:45.051
Yeah, he's got a whole new wardrobe.

40:46.393 --> 40:47.985
Check out the picture on his desk.

40:48.762 --> 40:53.165
Oh, my goodness, isn't she beautiful.
Is she your daughter?

40:55.903 --> 41:01.000
Well, no. No, Willie Ray,
actually, uh, she's my girlfriend.

41:02.576 --> 41:04.237
Ah!

41:04.411 --> 41:07.608
Ah! There they are.

41:08.282 --> 41:11.149
What is Charlene doing
with that strange boy?

41:11.318 --> 41:15.084
Just through this door. Back here.

41:16.557 --> 41:18.752
Charlie, let's go.

41:23.631 --> 41:24.655
Right this way, sir.

41:27.434 --> 41:28.628
Thank you.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.466
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:46.887 --> 41:50.050
So will James go back
to living with his dad now?

41:50.224 --> 41:51.919
Looks like it.

41:52.326 --> 41:54.692
And you're part of the reason why.

41:58.666 --> 42:00.361
Well, thank you, Aunt Brenda.

42:06.740 --> 42:09.174
Lieutenant, you'll handle
the paperwork on our end?

42:09.343 --> 42:11.675
- Happy to, chief.
- Thanks. Oh.

42:13.514 --> 42:14.572
Excuse me.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.512
I'm almost afraid to ask...

42:17.685 --> 42:21.485
...did I hear Charlene
say the words "thank you"?

42:21.655 --> 42:25.250
Oh, Mama,
y'all are overreacting to Charlie.

42:25.426 --> 42:28.054
She's just going through a phase.
Nothing I can't handle.

42:28.229 --> 42:31.323
I so admire your confidence,
Brenda Leigh.

42:31.498 --> 42:33.830
- Do you?
- Yes, I do, honey.

42:34.001 --> 42:40.167
And the terrific thing here is that while
you're teaching Charlie about life and all...

42:40.341 --> 42:42.502
...you're gonna learn a lot from her too.

42:42.676 --> 42:46.203
I just know it. Mm-hm.

42:47.214 --> 42:49.910
You are going to learn things now...

42:50.084 --> 42:54.384
...that you're gonna remember
for the rest of your life.
