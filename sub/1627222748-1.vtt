WEBVTT

00:32.771 --> 00:34.686
Are you alone
in the house, sir?

00:34.860 --> 00:37.559
Dispatch, we'’re interviewing
a Benjamin T. Myers.

00:37.733 --> 00:40.127
Driver'’s license 9217865.

00:40.301 --> 00:44.783
We have a white Caucasian male
on his way to the hospital.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.481
Suspected shooter was shot.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.874
Victim is 71 years old.
Male.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.226
GSW to the abdomen.
No exit wound,
low caliber projectile.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.925
Nobody thinks
they'’re gonna live forever.

00:59.668 --> 01:02.975
But I'’m not finished
Not yet.

01:12.724 --> 01:16.815
Alone, with nobody.

01:16.989 --> 01:19.383
Possible puncture
to the duodenum.

01:19.557 --> 01:23.822
Mr. Myers, are you on
any medications presently?

01:23.996 --> 01:25.389
Mr. Myers?

01:26.390 --> 01:28.175
Why would you do this?

01:28.349 --> 01:31.352
The things I'’ve done.

01:31.526 --> 01:33.615
Unit 21, please come in.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.965
Patient'’s in and out
of consciousness.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.142
If I wake up...

01:39.316 --> 01:43.538
If I wake up,
I'’ll choose different.

02:10.042 --> 02:12.828
Have I ever asked
for forgiveness?

02:13.002 --> 02:14.786
No.

02:16.005 --> 02:19.051
But I know I want someone
to stay with me.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.752
Lie to me
that it will be all right.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.061
Ah!

02:29.236 --> 02:33.718
Aw, you didn'’t even
touch your breakfast. Nan!

02:35.198 --> 02:36.547
Beauty?

02:39.681 --> 02:41.552
We die alone.

02:52.041 --> 02:55.131
I just don'’t want to
live alone anymore.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.358
I want to be missed.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.626
Just a minute.

03:13.193 --> 03:17.501
But I wanted a lot
that never came true.

03:17.675 --> 03:23.115
And I'’ve done things
I never wanted to do.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.212
Los siento.

03:32.908 --> 03:36.520
Wait. Wait! Hey!

03:36.694 --> 03:39.523
Everybody chooses.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.265
But is it too late?

03:44.963 --> 03:46.138
For any of us?

03:46.313 --> 03:50.099
I gotta go in to meet Nicky
at the bar.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.971
My daughter, Nickel,
the homicide detective.

03:53.145 --> 03:57.367
She became a cop
to catch me.

04:00.152 --> 04:03.895
Or her sister, Sherry,
who had no father,

04:04.069 --> 04:06.289
and even
less of a chance.

04:07.682 --> 04:11.381
Sweetie, eh... I haven'’t
been in for three weeks.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.601
You never know
with Tommy.

04:13.775 --> 04:17.822
Okay. That new girl,
she didn'’t work out.

04:17.996 --> 04:21.565
So, uh,
I won'’t be gone long.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.307
Just don'’t let
anybody in.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.271
I'’d be happy to.

04:32.097 --> 04:34.578
And my beauty, Nan...

04:37.059 --> 04:40.541
who left me
without going anywhere.

04:47.722 --> 04:51.465
-Nan? Nan, what is it?
-

04:57.340 --> 05:01.039
It'’s okay. It'’s okay.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.392
It'’s okay.

05:15.402 --> 05:18.274
All right,
beautiful girl.

06:30.172 --> 06:33.741
I went legit
12 years ago,

06:33.915 --> 06:39.007
thanks to a congressman
who owed me a favor.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.792
And now,
my daughter, Nicky,

06:41.966 --> 06:44.969
practically works
for that congressman

06:45.143 --> 06:47.929
as his police liaison.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.194
She and I are not close.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.373
Hey, Ben!

06:57.547 --> 07:00.289
You okay?
You doing all right?

07:00.463 --> 07:02.204
You really wanted to know
the answer to that,

07:02.378 --> 07:03.858
you'’d have come sooner.

07:04.032 --> 07:06.121
I'’m sorry,
the congressman'’s scrambling

07:06.295 --> 07:08.819
since we lost the
redistricting. We have a...

07:08.993 --> 07:12.432
We have a major campaign
relaunch this evening,

07:12.606 --> 07:14.085
so my plate
has been pretty full.

07:14.259 --> 07:18.002
Have you, uh, acquainted
your Representative Billings

07:18.176 --> 07:20.570
with his new constituency?

07:21.832 --> 07:24.095
I mean the people
he'’s been calling wetbacks

07:24.269 --> 07:25.793
for the last few years.

07:28.317 --> 07:29.884
Tricky, I know.

07:30.058 --> 07:32.103
I know
that representative...

07:33.191 --> 07:36.891
constituent relation
better than anybody.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.242
Yeah, it'’s tricky.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.505
That'’s why it was hard
for me to get away,

07:42.679 --> 07:45.334
and that'’s why I'’m gonna have
to go pretty soon,

07:45.508 --> 07:48.119
but I need to talk to you
about something.
It'’s very important.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.340
Not very close.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.963
I need to talk to you
about your grandsons.

08:06.137 --> 08:09.532
I don'’t have grandsons,
Nicky. You know that
better than anybody.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.752
Uh, can I get you
some coffee?

08:11.926 --> 08:15.538
No thanks. I need
to talk to you.

08:15.712 --> 08:19.411
Sherry. It'’s about Sherry,
your daughter.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.066
She is not my kid, Nick.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.678
She'’s been at St. Vinny'’s
for two months,

08:24.852 --> 08:27.332
and now they just
put her in hospice.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.943
I don'’t know
if you knew that.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.640
The heroin.

08:31.685 --> 08:34.122
She'’s gonna die.
And, Dad...

08:35.602 --> 08:37.865
Sherry'’s boys
are such good boys.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.911
But they'’re not
very verbal.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.784
I think there'’s a way
that we could help them.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.916
There'’s this special school,

08:46.090 --> 08:50.660
and Sherry
has named you if--
when she, you know,

08:50.834 --> 08:53.271
and all you need to do
is sign once.
I will take care of...

08:53.445 --> 08:55.360
What are you doing?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.493
Something I should have done
a long time ago

08:57.667 --> 08:59.582
when you came to me
for college.

08:59.756 --> 09:04.761
Uh, that'’s-- that'’s $20,000
in cash. No taxes.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.067
This is for me?

09:07.068 --> 09:09.287
Dad, that was
20 years ago.Well--

09:09.461 --> 09:11.551
I don'’t-- I don'’t need
that money anymore.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.205
This is not
"No, thank you" money.

09:14.379 --> 09:17.252
You can give
the money to Sherry.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.471
Okay, listen.
What'’s going on here?

09:19.646 --> 09:23.693
Wha-- What'’s the angle?
What do you want?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.608
There has to be a want?

09:25.782 --> 09:27.828
Always with you. Always.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.230
I have cancer--What?

09:39.404 --> 09:41.450
Leukemia.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.539
And--Wait! Wait! No.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.236
And it'’s bad.Are you kidding me?

09:45.410 --> 09:46.977
I... Are you--

09:47.151 --> 09:49.414
It almost feels
like a relief.

09:49.589 --> 09:53.810
You know, I-I-I tried
to hire this maid today,

09:53.984 --> 09:56.596
and she took one look and
turned around and walked out.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.902
And that'’s kind of the essence
of my problem.

09:59.076 --> 10:02.863
I need someone
who'’s going to help me with Nan.

10:05.039 --> 10:06.606
Oh, God.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.564
You always
had the worst timing.

10:08.738 --> 10:12.307
I wouldn'’t
ask this of you, unless...

10:13.743 --> 10:15.963
Unless I had no choice.

10:17.660 --> 10:22.622
I gotta know
that there'’s gonna
be somebody to help with Nan.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.147
Dad?

10:27.148 --> 10:28.845
What about the boys?

10:29.019 --> 10:31.239
Can'’t you care
about them, too?You won'’t understand--

10:31.413 --> 10:33.720
You'’d just sign one time,
and you'’d give those boys
a chance.

10:33.894 --> 10:37.462
Ah, you were just a kid.
Look, uh...

10:37.637 --> 10:41.292
When I went away,
your mother

10:41.466 --> 10:45.035
wouldn'’t have anything to do
with, and I mean nothing,

10:45.209 --> 10:47.603
nothing to do with me.

10:48.517 --> 10:51.825
Nobody understood
except Nan.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.610
Because you chose her.

10:56.394 --> 11:00.398
A man lives
and he makes choices. Yes!

11:00.572 --> 11:02.270
And she'’s my wife.

11:02.444 --> 11:05.665
And I would-- What? What?
What are you doing here?

11:05.839 --> 11:07.536
Well, I'’ve been
coming in early--

11:07.710 --> 11:09.669
I told you to stay late!

11:09.843 --> 11:13.020
I'’m making sure
we'’re okay--I-I left a message.

11:13.194 --> 11:15.457
I-I didn'’t know.
I'’ll get out.

11:15.631 --> 11:17.764
No, it'’s okay, Tommy.
It'’s fine.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.766
I-I'’m gonna go anyway.

11:21.942 --> 11:24.292
Look...

11:27.774 --> 11:29.558
I'’ll help you, Dad.
I'’ll help you with Nan.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.081
It'’s fine. I'’ll do it.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.087
And there'’s more.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.047
I'’m not taking that.

11:40.221 --> 11:45.269
This is why I'’m helping Nan,
because I care about her.

11:45.443 --> 11:48.403
But this
would never be enough.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.971
I know it'’s not enough.
I'’m not saying it'’s enough.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.581
I'’m not doing that!

11:52.755 --> 11:54.714
I am not-- I am not--

11:54.888 --> 11:56.977
You-- Goddamn it!

11:58.674 --> 12:01.024
I was-- I been coming in
early to make sure that--

12:02.460 --> 12:04.549
I'’m sorry, um...

12:04.724 --> 12:07.248
Where did you
leave me a message?

12:07.422 --> 12:09.641
It doesn'’t really matter
now, does it?

12:15.996 --> 12:19.173
Jo, he did not
sign the papers.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.175
He did not
sign the papers.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.351
Because, because
he told me he was sick,

12:23.525 --> 12:26.397
and then he tried to buy me,
and I just got too mad.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.617
I couldn'’t do it.
I'’m sorry.

12:30.140 --> 12:33.013
Hold on.

12:33.187 --> 12:37.278
Yeah, I don'’t know.
Yes, he'’s a son of a bitch.

12:37.452 --> 12:40.977
I'’m a freakin'’ idiot...

12:42.283 --> 12:43.806
for even trying this.

12:45.939 --> 12:50.378
Now? I don'’t know, Sherry'’s
just gonna have to do it.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.728
She just has to.

12:54.295 --> 12:57.472
I'’ll do my best. Love you.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.576
Hi, Sher. How you doing?

13:23.585 --> 13:25.369
You don'’t look good.

13:25.543 --> 13:28.764
Well, fortunately, you look
good enough for the both of us.

13:29.765 --> 13:32.072
How'’s the boys? Miss '’em.

13:32.246 --> 13:34.770
My boys are great,
thank you.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.164
And how are you doing?
How, how are they
treating you here?

13:37.338 --> 13:40.341
Church fosters
are bringing '’em over
to see me today.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.125
My boys love me.

13:42.778 --> 13:43.997
Of course they do.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.956
You said
I was a bad mom.

13:47.957 --> 13:51.482
You... you took them.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.267
I only took '’em
'’cause you were sick

13:53.441 --> 13:55.008
and you couldn'’t take care
of them for a little while.

13:55.182 --> 13:58.098
You took my boys
from me.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.535
No, sweetheart,
I love them too.You t--

14:00.709 --> 14:02.885
I love them too, as--
Okay.

14:03.973 --> 14:06.323
Nick--Okay, Sherry. Okay.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.330
Who'’s your friend?

14:14.418 --> 14:15.637
It'’s Matilda.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.553
That'’s the best name, ever.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.208
You always had a way
of coming up
with the best things.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.735
Like you could take
the, the worst things,

14:26.909 --> 14:31.653
the really, really bad stuff
and somehow make it funny even.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.221
I always admired that
about you, Sherry.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.832
No.Yeah.

14:37.006 --> 14:40.183
It'’s like your job
was to make the bad things
not so bad.

14:42.142 --> 14:45.885
And my job was to try
and stop the bad things
from happening.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.454
You'’re a good
big sister, Nick.

14:50.628 --> 14:54.719
No. A good big sister
would have protected you.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.331
And-and-and not left you
with Mom.

14:58.245 --> 15:00.160
I would have gotten you
to school.

15:03.293 --> 15:06.557
But, Sherry, that'’s
what I want to do
for the boys now.

15:06.731 --> 15:09.256
I want to give them the chance
that you never had.

15:09.430 --> 15:12.650
Well, the church
is looking after '’em now.

15:13.390 --> 15:15.349
God is with them.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.918
Yes, and God will look
after the boys

15:19.092 --> 15:22.399
in this amazing
church school

15:22.573 --> 15:25.925
that I found for them
for special needs kids.

15:26.099 --> 15:29.363
And they can get all the
attention and education.

15:32.366 --> 15:36.283
So they can be big strong boys
and make their mama proud.

15:37.806 --> 15:40.417
Does that sound like
a good idea for you? Yeah?

15:40.591 --> 15:42.245
Yeah.Yeah.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.943
All right.

15:44.117 --> 15:46.989
I love you, my darling girl.
I love you.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.211
I'’ll take care
of everything, okay?

15:51.994 --> 15:53.126
Mmm.

17:05.502 --> 17:06.677
Nan?

17:08.853 --> 17:09.985
Nan?

17:15.251 --> 17:16.339
Nan?

17:26.262 --> 17:27.307
Nan.

17:28.612 --> 17:31.528
Okay, okay.

17:31.702 --> 17:34.227
Aw, Nan.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.579
What happened?

17:40.972 --> 17:42.583
Who...

17:42.757 --> 17:46.500
They took everything.
They took my whole--

17:51.113 --> 17:53.072
How could you
let them in?

17:55.161 --> 17:57.598
Ah, Nan...

17:57.772 --> 17:59.426
Oh, why did you
let '’em in?

17:59.600 --> 18:00.818
Nan!

18:06.998 --> 18:08.043
Nan!

18:12.613 --> 18:14.571
I couldn'’t see
a way out.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.489
Beauty girl...

18:24.451 --> 18:26.105
Oh, Nan.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.019
No!Na--

18:29.412 --> 18:32.720
There is nothing left of us.

19:03.011 --> 19:07.146
She'’s been gone a long time.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.290
But I was too afraid...

19:24.511 --> 19:25.555
to choose.

19:39.047 --> 19:42.224
Nan... Just stay,
stay there!

19:45.401 --> 19:48.665
Just stay there,
and I'’ll be back in a...

19:49.623 --> 19:51.538
As soon as I can.

19:53.975 --> 19:59.894
Okay. Okay. Okay.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.116
Somebody did this.

20:08.468 --> 20:12.298
Mr. Myers,
Savannah PD, please open up.

20:13.168 --> 20:16.345
Just a minute,
Officer.

20:17.999 --> 20:21.394
And I couldn'’t
find them behind bars.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.613
We need you
to open the door.

20:24.658 --> 20:27.617
I decided to do
what I do.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.929
Sir, we need you
to open the door, now.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.626
What'’s the problem, Officer?

20:36.800 --> 20:40.195
We received a report of shots
fired at this address.

20:40.369 --> 20:44.634
I didn'’t hear any gunfire,
and I didn'’t call any cops.

20:44.808 --> 20:48.203
There'’s been a mistake.
I'’m Ben Myers.

20:48.377 --> 20:50.249
I'’m the owner
of this property.

20:51.598 --> 20:53.164
Are you alone
in the house, sir?

20:53.339 --> 20:55.254
Except for you.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.647
I was gonna lie down.

20:57.821 --> 21:00.302
I didn'’t call any cops,
and I didn'’t hear any shots.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.173
I know you didn'’t
call the cops.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.263
I know you didn'’t
report the shots.
It was your neighbor.

21:04.437 --> 21:06.482
Would you mind
stepping out here
and talking to us?

21:06.656 --> 21:08.789
Why? I can hear you fine.

21:08.963 --> 21:12.923
Why don'’t you go over
to her house?
She may have a gun.

21:13.097 --> 21:17.624
I'’m gonna take a nap,
and while I am,
you'’re not allowed in.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.540
Is your wife inside, sir?

21:21.541 --> 21:23.891
-Is she all right?

21:26.937 --> 21:28.591
Yeah, we'’re fine.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.333
Get off my lawn.

21:31.507 --> 21:32.856
We need to see inside.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.902
Looking around corners
all my life,

21:35.076 --> 21:37.513
I missed what was
right in front of my face.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.776
You got a warrant?

21:39.950 --> 21:42.910
Until you do, you'’re not
allowed in here.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.043
Your license, sir?

21:46.217 --> 21:48.437
Slide it under the door.

21:49.917 --> 21:53.268
Ah, I can fix this.

21:56.706 --> 21:59.666
It goes... here.

21:59.840 --> 22:03.191
There, now I think
if you roll down this thing--

22:03.365 --> 22:05.672
No, no, no.
Don'’t touch that!
Hey! Hey!

22:05.846 --> 22:07.891
What the hell'’s the matter
with you?I did-- I'’m gonna--

22:08.065 --> 22:10.241
Get out of here!All right. I'’m just
trying to help.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.722
I don'’t need your help,
Mr. Fix-It.Okay.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.423
Hey, you need
anything else?

22:17.597 --> 22:20.077
No. Yes!Huh?

22:20.251 --> 22:24.168
I need a phone number
for Jackson-Polk Surveying.

22:25.474 --> 22:29.957
Poke? P-O-K...
- P-O-L-K.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.046
As in the president.

22:32.220 --> 22:36.180
L-K. P-O-L-K,
like the president.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.487
Gotcha.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.258
Yo! Hey, it'’s time to go.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.913
I got the cameras,
and Reggie'’s got the list.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.307
I got the-- Aw, shit!

23:16.482 --> 23:17.526
Watch it!

23:20.268 --> 23:21.487
I got the list.

23:27.928 --> 23:29.756
Hey, Jimmy'’s coming
with the lady.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.715
Which one is Jimmy?

23:34.456 --> 23:36.545
If you have
any questions, all right...

23:40.027 --> 23:41.158
Well, um...

23:48.818 --> 23:50.472
We already spoke
with, um...

23:50.646 --> 23:54.258
You must be Reggie.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.875
Mr. Ben, your husband.
He-he can call the gas comp--

24:02.049 --> 24:06.575
- And who are you?

24:13.887 --> 24:16.106
...call the gas company
if he has any concerns.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.718
And, uh, we'’re gonna
need this too, ma'’am.

24:20.023 --> 24:21.503
But-- For our files.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.207
You'’re gonna be okay,
Mrs. Myers.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.688
We found all the leaks.
All right?

24:35.256 --> 24:37.171
You have a good--
good morning.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.246
Ben?

25:20.257 --> 25:23.304
Boss, I am really sorry.
I have looked everywhere.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.481
Jackson-Polk Surveying...

25:28.178 --> 25:29.615
It doesn'’t exist.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.623
Good, good.

25:40.451 --> 25:43.063
Give me the flip phone.
I'’ve gotta make a call to Ray.

25:43.237 --> 25:44.368
Yeah?

25:46.022 --> 25:47.110
Yeah.

25:48.242 --> 25:51.462
I'’m looking for a--
a white cargo van,

25:51.637 --> 25:53.334
that'’s leaking
steering fluid.

25:57.338 --> 25:58.382
Okay.

26:15.008 --> 26:16.487
Nick! Nick!

26:16.662 --> 26:18.881
Hey, Mrs. Billings.I'’m glad you'’re here.

26:19.055 --> 26:21.536
There'’s a problem
with the rally.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.407
When I arranged
for the permits,

26:23.582 --> 26:25.801
the Savannah Mayor'’s Office,
they issued them,

26:25.975 --> 26:27.934
but they wouldn'’t
close the streets.Oh, no.

26:28.108 --> 26:31.633
Well, I didn'’t think
it was a big thing, but...

26:31.807 --> 26:35.985
They don'’t think we'’ll have
enough people to warrant
disrupting the commute.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.814
Okay. Let me make
a few calls.
I'’ll fix this.

26:38.988 --> 26:41.164
It'’s a safety issue,
I'’ll fix it, I'’ll fix it.

26:41.338 --> 26:45.168
Okay, thank you. I knew you
would help. You always do.

26:45.342 --> 26:47.910
Of course, ma'’am.
I'’ll see you later.Okay.

26:49.433 --> 26:50.870
Well, thank you,
Mr. Speaker.

26:51.044 --> 26:53.176
Sir, we did not expect
to be in this situation

26:55.396 --> 26:57.746
Uh-huh. Um...

26:57.920 --> 26:59.618
Uh... What?

27:00.749 --> 27:01.924
You will?

27:02.708 --> 27:04.013
This weekend?

27:04.927 --> 27:07.930
Sir, that is--
That is a lifesaver.

27:08.104 --> 27:10.324
I'’m gonna make you feel good
about this decision, Paul.

27:10.498 --> 27:12.631
When we win, you'’re
gonna feel great.

27:12.805 --> 27:15.198
Thank you so much, sir.
Okay.

27:15.372 --> 27:16.765
All right, goodbye,
Mr. Speaker.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.898
Yes, bye-bye.

27:19.072 --> 27:20.639
Good news, sir?

27:20.813 --> 27:24.033
Oh, that is
excellent news, Nick.

27:24.207 --> 27:25.948
I'’m happy for you,
Congressman.

27:26.122 --> 27:29.560
Oh! So...
How you doing?

27:30.387 --> 27:31.998
I'’m good, sir.

27:32.172 --> 27:35.131
Well, you... seem
a little distracted.

27:35.305 --> 27:39.266
I just, I just, uh,
had some, you know,
news about my dad.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.442
I'’m a little worried
about him. That'’s all.

27:41.616 --> 27:42.661
Ben Myers?

27:44.184 --> 27:45.664
You know who my dad is?

27:48.014 --> 27:50.059
And you hired me anyway?

27:52.322 --> 27:54.716
Did I ever tell you
my dad drank?

27:57.763 --> 28:00.766
He fell into a vat
of pet food

28:00.940 --> 28:03.464
in a plant on the I-15.

28:05.205 --> 28:06.902
Oh, my God. Did he die?

28:07.076 --> 28:09.470
Yeah, he did.

28:09.644 --> 28:11.820
I'’m so sorry.The point is,

28:11.994 --> 28:14.475
you can'’t
pick your parents.

28:14.649 --> 28:17.347
Can'’t choose
where you come from.

28:17.521 --> 28:21.351
The only thing
you get to decide
is where you'’re going,

28:21.525 --> 28:24.790
And who
you'’re going with.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.749
Oh, sir, uh, shots fired.
I'’m sorry. I have--
I have to go.

28:27.923 --> 28:30.143
Sure, of course, yes.
Yeah, yeah.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.058
So, Nick, just one thing.
Nick, just one thing.

28:32.232 --> 28:33.624
I need you
on my six, okay?

28:33.799 --> 28:37.585
Esta noche,
I need you on my six.
Okay?

28:37.759 --> 28:39.326
Sir, you got it
a hundred percent.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.632
It'’s going to go
really, really well.
I promise.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.765
I have your back, okay?Great.

28:43.939 --> 28:47.769
And, Nick, no matter what,
you come to me or count on me
for your dad.

28:47.943 --> 28:50.293
I appreciate that, sir.
Thank you.

28:55.385 --> 28:58.214
Dad, I heard a disturbance
was reported over at your house.

28:58.388 --> 28:59.955
Are you okay? Is Nan okay?

29:00.129 --> 29:01.827
How did you hear
about that?

29:02.001 --> 29:03.959
I-I-I put a sticker
on your file. Family.

29:04.133 --> 29:05.961
The lieutenant
over at your precinct

29:06.135 --> 29:08.224
gave me a courtesy call.
What'’s going on?

29:08.398 --> 29:10.618
Nicky, I'’m gonna have
to call you back.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.489
Dad, is Nan okay?

29:26.852 --> 29:29.811
Tommy?Yeah, Ben.

29:29.985 --> 29:34.033
What are you doing with me?
I mean, still with me?

29:38.167 --> 29:43.738
'’Cause I, um...
owe you my life, Ben.

29:45.871 --> 29:48.177
That was a long time ago.

29:54.618 --> 29:59.275
Boss, I-I know
that you got some bad news.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.063
Whatever you need...

30:06.761 --> 30:07.762
That'’s why I'’m here.

30:09.677 --> 30:14.160
No questions, just
'’cause you... owe me?

30:14.334 --> 30:18.207
No, you'’re not the only guy
who chooses, Ben.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.385
I'’m here because I'’m here.

30:39.620 --> 30:42.449
It'’s me. Yeah.

30:42.623 --> 30:44.233
I need an answer.

30:44.407 --> 30:47.628
And I'’m willing to pay
extra for right now.

30:48.455 --> 30:49.760
By noon.

30:53.112 --> 30:57.681
A white cargo panel truck
that'’s leaking steering fluid.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.771
They-they must have
borrowed it from some,

31:00.946 --> 31:03.644
some rental lot or,
you know,

31:03.818 --> 31:06.081
mechanics that have
some kind of...

31:06.255 --> 31:08.736
understanding management.

31:08.910 --> 31:12.348
And it'’s gonna come back
some time today.

31:12.522 --> 31:15.090
Yeah, I want to be there
when it does.

31:24.012 --> 31:25.796
Yeah.

31:25.971 --> 31:29.539
No, that'’s good.
That'’s worth five big ones.

31:29.713 --> 31:32.020
I tell you what. Come by
the office in the bar

31:32.194 --> 31:33.761
any time
after three o'’clock,

31:33.935 --> 31:35.632
Tommy will give you
an envelope.

31:36.372 --> 31:37.547
Yeah.

31:47.470 --> 31:48.515
Can I help you?

31:48.689 --> 31:51.213
Yeah, where the hell
is everybody?

31:51.387 --> 31:53.737
You lost? It'’s lunch time.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.392
Oh, oh. That'’s why
it'’s taken this long

31:56.566 --> 31:58.438
just to get
to the steering column.

31:58.612 --> 32:01.136
You know my guys
brought that van in
a couple of days ago.

32:01.310 --> 32:04.096
No, we just got this
in here yesterday.

32:04.270 --> 32:05.662
It'’s a really
hard leak to find.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.273
We took it out to see
if we got it, but, you know.

32:07.447 --> 32:09.014
Oh, you test drove
it yourself

32:09.188 --> 32:10.841
and you still can'’t find
the goddamned leak.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.756
I told--
Look, I'’m gonna get to it.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.497
I'’m going to work on it
right now.

32:14.671 --> 32:15.716
Okay.

32:16.412 --> 32:17.674
You have a good day.

32:22.375 --> 32:25.204
Crazy old dude.

32:50.446 --> 32:51.926
Now, now...

32:52.100 --> 32:56.191
Did you drive this
to Palmetto Way
this morning?

32:56.365 --> 32:57.801
How'’d it handle?

32:57.976 --> 33:00.413
It wasn'’t me!It wasn'’t you?

33:00.587 --> 33:04.199
It wasn'’t me!

33:05.374 --> 33:07.724
Angel, stop!

33:07.898 --> 33:10.684
Yeah, Angel. Stop.

33:10.858 --> 33:13.295
Drop the bat.Fuck that!

33:15.515 --> 33:18.039
You ever seen
a six-fingered
auto mechanic?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.956
Yeah, Angel. Do it.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.047
Good, now...

33:26.917 --> 33:29.094
You and me and, uh...
Sorry.

33:29.268 --> 33:30.747
Rob!Rob...

33:30.921 --> 33:32.488
We can take our time.

33:32.662 --> 33:35.491
To figure out what happened
to this car this morning.

33:37.624 --> 33:39.147
You ever seen this guy?

33:39.887 --> 33:41.062
No!

33:41.236 --> 33:43.064
Come on, man!

33:44.196 --> 33:46.502
What about this guy?
You ever see this guy?

33:50.332 --> 33:52.726
You know it'’s going to take me
two hands to break your wrists.

33:52.900 --> 33:55.990
Reggie! Reggie.
It'’s Reggie.Reggie what?

33:56.164 --> 33:58.601
Reggie fucking Black guy
that pissed you off,
how would I know?

33:58.775 --> 34:00.864
You'’re not going to tell me
anything to lead me to him?

34:01.039 --> 34:02.866
I can find
his license plate.

34:03.650 --> 34:04.868
On the surveillance.

34:05.739 --> 34:07.306
I can get the plate.

34:10.483 --> 34:12.659
Do that, Angel.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.269
Get the license plate.

34:15.009 --> 34:16.489
Please hurry!

34:18.752 --> 34:20.101
We'’ll be here.

34:35.247 --> 34:36.596
Hey, hey, hey!

34:36.770 --> 34:38.511
What?You get that shit
out of my car.

34:38.685 --> 34:41.079
Well, I only got 15 minutes.

34:47.215 --> 34:48.869
It'’s a thousand.

34:49.043 --> 34:50.566
What'’s a thousand?

34:50.740 --> 34:52.264
For an address?

34:52.438 --> 34:55.005
Mr. Myers, been a while.

34:55.180 --> 34:58.966
For old time'’s sake,
I'’m giving you a discount.

34:59.140 --> 35:03.231
That thing'’s worth 300,
500 tops.

35:03.405 --> 35:06.060
Maybe at the DMV,

35:06.234 --> 35:08.715
but then you'’d have
to wait in line.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.202
So, um...

35:17.376 --> 35:19.987
What you want with this
Reggie McIntyre anyway?

35:20.161 --> 35:21.945
I just want to talk to him.

35:22.120 --> 35:25.645
Yeah, he'’s not
very talkative lately.

35:25.819 --> 35:28.735
He, uh, has got an
interesting history, though--

35:29.692 --> 35:34.871
family, associates,
cooperation.

35:35.045 --> 35:38.397
You know, I'’m not a very
talkative person either.

35:38.571 --> 35:42.314
I think Reggie and I are
gonna get along just fine.

35:57.764 --> 36:01.942
Detective Wills, you are being
treated to a rare sighting.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.727
May I introduce you
to Detective Lieutenant
Nickel Wallace.

36:04.901 --> 36:07.556
She was assigned to
Congressman Billings'’
outreach team

36:07.730 --> 36:09.515
temporarily, what,
12 years ago?

36:09.689 --> 36:10.951
It'’s nice to meet you.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.518
It'’s personal, sir.

36:12.692 --> 36:15.042
You got a desk and a stack?Five inches deep.

36:15.216 --> 36:19.873
Dig into Rollins'’ files,
and take any warm ones
that are called in.

36:22.528 --> 36:25.487
That'’s what I like to see
in a homicide detective,

36:27.837 --> 36:30.057
Captain, there were
several gunshots fired

36:30.231 --> 36:31.841
at Ben Myers'’ residence,
and I--

36:32.015 --> 36:37.064
Allegedly, according
to nosy neighbor Gail Gearson,

36:37.238 --> 36:39.980
retired mob boss Ben Myers
fired four or five gunshots.

36:40.154 --> 36:41.547
You already knew.

36:41.721 --> 36:44.376
But, this crime boss
is now,

36:44.550 --> 36:48.771
unbeknownst to any of us,
an upstanding citizen.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.167
But what I didn'’t know is,

36:53.341 --> 36:55.909
that he had
a family relationship
with one of my detectives.

36:56.083 --> 36:59.956
And yes, as long as I'’m paying
your salary, you'’re still
one of mine.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.831
This is the first I'’m hearing
about the expungement, sir.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.050
And my mother and he
never married.

37:07.225 --> 37:10.228
And the joke was that
all she ever got from
him was a nickel.

37:10.402 --> 37:15.189
And all that changed a week ago
when you listed yourself
as his "in case of"?

37:15.363 --> 37:18.366
I discovered he has cancer.
He doesn'’t have very long
to live.

37:18.540 --> 37:20.977
And so I'’m trying
to make right
while I still can.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.457
Mm-hmm.

37:23.153 --> 37:24.590
Look, I'’m sorry.

37:24.764 --> 37:27.897
Nineteen years ago, sir,
I didn'’t think that

37:28.071 --> 37:31.074
I needed any more obstacles
than being female and poor.

37:31.249 --> 37:34.643
I didn'’t think
I needed to list my
felon father who left us

37:34.817 --> 37:36.602
when I was four years old.

37:36.776 --> 37:37.864
I'’m sorry.

38:06.719 --> 38:07.807
Nan?

38:08.547 --> 38:10.331
Are you in there, Nan?

38:10.505 --> 38:12.551
Nan, it'’s Nick,
are you okay?

38:21.821 --> 38:22.822
Nan?

38:23.562 --> 38:25.041
Nan, are you okay?

38:26.304 --> 38:28.306
Nan, sweetie, it'’s Nick.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.311
Oh, my God! Nan!

38:38.011 --> 38:39.447
Are you hurt?

38:39.621 --> 38:41.231
Are you shot?
Are you all right?

38:44.147 --> 38:48.195
Oh, my God.
What happened?

38:48.369 --> 38:51.590
Oh, I'’m sorry.
I'’ll take care of you.
I'’ll take care of you.

38:51.764 --> 38:53.200
It'’s going be all right.

38:59.902 --> 39:01.077
Thank God.

39:02.252 --> 39:05.908
Thank God. I am so glad
you came, Jo.

39:09.738 --> 39:12.045
I did not know
who else to call.

39:12.219 --> 39:13.655
The police?

39:15.135 --> 39:17.659
You are the police.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.618
But you'’re going to
cover up for your old man

39:19.792 --> 39:22.969
because you owe him for
your magnificent childhood?

39:23.143 --> 39:24.797
Right now, I'’m not
worried about him.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.755
All I'’m worried about
is Nan.

39:26.929 --> 39:29.410
I have to find somebody
who can take care of her.
Right away.

39:29.584 --> 39:30.890
That'’s all
I'’m worried about.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.153
Well, I'’m worried
about you, Nick.

39:33.893 --> 39:35.982
What'’s going on?

39:36.156 --> 39:39.899
You have been so weird
ever since your sister
took the boys.

39:40.073 --> 39:43.163
I'’m still trying to find
a way to help the boys.

39:43.337 --> 39:46.427
And, you know,
Billings is in trouble,

39:46.601 --> 39:50.170
and I know you don'’t
like him, but, you know,
he'’s my boss.

39:50.344 --> 39:53.042
I want my sister
to forgive me, before she...

39:56.045 --> 39:58.700
What'’s the prognosis?It'’s not good.

39:58.874 --> 40:02.269
The infection
has spread from her bones
to her heart. Endocarditis.

40:02.443 --> 40:05.403
You know her immune system
is shot. She'’s not gonna
make it out of there.

40:05.577 --> 40:07.883
Listen, can you help me
with Nan?

40:08.057 --> 40:09.319
Please.

40:11.234 --> 40:12.758
You'’re just using me.

40:14.237 --> 40:17.066
It happens to social workers
all the time.Shut up.

40:17.240 --> 40:20.287
You just want me for my
high-powered connections.

40:20.461 --> 40:24.944
Okay, but can you
help me with Nan?

40:29.731 --> 40:30.993
Let me see
what I can do.

41:21.783 --> 41:24.220
It felt good
to be doing something.

41:40.976 --> 41:45.894
Plus, Reggie seemed to have
some time on his hands

41:46.068 --> 41:47.809
to enlighten me.

42:28.937 --> 42:30.983
Oh, yeah.

42:36.945 --> 42:38.164
Hit that shit.

42:39.861 --> 42:42.995
Oh, yeah.
-

42:50.698 --> 42:52.657
Reggie.You!

42:52.831 --> 42:54.006
Stop!

42:58.924 --> 43:01.927
I just wanna talk!
I just wanna...

43:03.798 --> 43:06.061
I wanna--
I just wanna--

43:46.493 --> 43:48.451
If you have
any questions...

43:58.157 --> 44:01.377
Onyx,
it changed itself

44:01.551 --> 44:04.032
into what you'’re
looking at right now.

44:04.206 --> 44:05.860
Does that sound familiar
to you?

44:13.085 --> 44:17.480
Twelve years ago,
a congressman had a problem.

44:18.960 --> 44:21.049
She was his maid,

44:21.223 --> 44:23.008
so he called me.

44:34.367 --> 44:36.586
I guessed
what the problem was.

44:41.504 --> 44:45.160
You just don'’t bury
some problems.

44:46.858 --> 44:48.250
I let her go.

44:48.424 --> 44:50.513
Oh, yeah.

44:52.820 --> 44:56.432
But I made her promise
she would not come back.

45:02.134 --> 45:03.918
She could never come back.

45:09.924 --> 45:12.535
Ay, Yonny!
Are you packed?

45:12.710 --> 45:14.973
We'’re always moving,
and we didn'’t do nothing.

45:15.147 --> 45:16.801
It'’s not safe, Yonny.
Okay?

45:16.975 --> 45:18.541
Is this about the police?

45:18.716 --> 45:20.413
No, it'’s not about
the police.

45:20.587 --> 45:22.763
A man who knows me,
who knows who I am--

45:22.937 --> 45:24.504
What man? What'’s going on?

45:25.984 --> 45:28.813
He just saw me today.
Please, go pack your bag.

45:28.987 --> 45:30.945
Don'’t make me
tell you again!Please listen to me.

45:31.119 --> 45:33.295
I'’m legal. You said
my father was legal.

45:33.469 --> 45:35.733
So, maybe my father
can help.

45:35.907 --> 45:37.952
Yonatan, please.

45:38.126 --> 45:41.390
I'’m trying to tell you.
We can'’t run forever.

45:43.436 --> 45:45.307
No, listen. We need help.

45:45.481 --> 45:47.309
It'’s not safe, Yonny.

45:51.487 --> 45:54.012
You won'’t even tell me
who he is.

46:55.682 --> 46:56.726
Tommy!

46:57.379 --> 46:59.773
Yeah, Ben! On my way.

46:59.947 --> 47:03.037
I thought I told you
to clean up the alley.

47:03.211 --> 47:04.691
Oh, I did, boss.
You didn'’t see?

47:04.865 --> 47:08.086
Well, uh, there'’s a fire
in one of the barrels.

47:08.260 --> 47:11.393
Now, now, now, now, when
that fire burns itself out,

47:11.567 --> 47:13.700
I want you
to take that barrel

47:13.874 --> 47:15.658
down to the dumpster
yourself. Okay?

47:15.833 --> 47:18.661
Uh, yeah, okay.What?

47:18.836 --> 47:21.316
Nothing, enough--
I'’m sorry, I'’m listening.All right, shush!

47:21.490 --> 47:26.191
Ray'’s gonna, is gonna call
someone to pick this up.
At 3:15.

47:26.365 --> 47:29.759
And I'’ve been here
since 10:15. Right?

47:30.717 --> 47:31.936
Um...

47:34.503 --> 47:36.766
Oh, yeah. Um...

47:36.941 --> 47:39.247
You were already inside
when I came back in

47:39.421 --> 47:42.816
from cleaning
the alley, right? 10:15.

47:42.990 --> 47:45.384
So-- All right.Don'’t forget to--

47:45.558 --> 47:47.081
You were robbed!

47:47.255 --> 47:49.083
What are you talking about?
Make that call.

47:49.257 --> 47:50.780
I just went by
your house.

47:54.436 --> 47:57.875
Look, let'’s go inside.
Please!

48:14.195 --> 48:15.805
Are you out of your mind?

48:15.980 --> 48:18.243
You come in my place
in front of my people,

48:18.417 --> 48:20.593
and you say
that I got robbed.

48:20.767 --> 48:23.030
That I got robbed.

48:23.204 --> 48:25.641
I'’ve been to your house, Dad.
I found Nan.

48:26.512 --> 48:27.905
I took care of her.

48:29.167 --> 48:30.516
I found her a place.

48:30.690 --> 48:32.561
At the Savannah Senior Center

48:32.735 --> 48:35.129
which is a very nice place.
Where it will be
completely private.

48:35.303 --> 48:36.914
Discreet. No one
will know about it.

48:37.088 --> 48:39.829
And the most important thing
is she'’s going to be safe.

48:43.398 --> 48:48.142
Nan is in a home,
and I'’m not even dead.

48:53.104 --> 48:55.584
She'’s safe, that'’s what
you want for her, right?

48:56.890 --> 48:58.457
But you were robbed, Dad.

48:58.631 --> 49:00.720
The place was a wreck.
I couldn'’t leave her there.

49:00.894 --> 49:03.592
Why didn'’t you call
the police? Or me?

49:03.766 --> 49:07.074
How many burglaries
did you actually solve

49:07.248 --> 49:10.817
when-when you were
in charge of that, huh?

49:21.915 --> 49:23.090
Let me help.

49:24.135 --> 49:26.876
Tell me how
I can help you, Dad.

49:27.051 --> 49:29.749
I used to be someone
important in this town.

49:30.968 --> 49:35.885
Nothing happens in this town
unless I say so.

49:37.713 --> 49:39.237
Now they just...

49:41.326 --> 49:43.458
walk right into my own...

49:52.946 --> 49:54.861
Dad, are-are you...

49:55.035 --> 49:57.472
Are you trying to fix this
by yourself?

49:57.646 --> 49:59.909
You smell
like cleaning fluid.

50:00.954 --> 50:03.435
You changed
your clothes, are...

50:03.609 --> 50:06.612
Are you trying to take
care of this on your own?

50:08.135 --> 50:10.311
I'’m at a dead end.

50:13.010 --> 50:14.881
I'’m at a dead end.

50:24.064 --> 50:25.761
Oh, Dad, I'’m sorry.
I have to take this.

50:25.935 --> 50:27.372
It'’s, uh,
it'’s the station.

50:31.550 --> 50:33.987
I'’m sorry.

50:36.555 --> 50:38.557
Yeah, I remember you.
What'’s going on?

50:38.731 --> 50:41.168
We got a homicide
on 211 San Juan.What?

50:41.342 --> 50:43.040
You know anything?

50:43.214 --> 50:46.956
Uh, Reggie McIntyre,
29, skinny?

50:47.131 --> 50:50.134
Shit, what--
Yeah, he was my CI,

50:50.308 --> 50:53.311
but, um, that was
a long time ago.

50:53.485 --> 50:56.009
I-I have no idea
what he'’s been
mixed up in lately.

50:56.183 --> 50:59.534
You have no idea
what could have gotten
Reggie McIntyre killed?

50:59.708 --> 51:03.016
I'’m sorry, Detective.
I have no idea what happened.

51:05.410 --> 51:07.325
All right, thank you.

51:07.934 --> 51:09.153
Thanks.

51:18.162 --> 51:20.903
Come on, pick up.
Pick up.

51:25.082 --> 51:27.649
Come on, pick up, Jimmy.
Come on.

51:41.228 --> 51:43.709
Jimmy, I'’m right
outside the door.

51:52.021 --> 51:53.588
You weren'’t gonna
tell me?

51:55.764 --> 51:58.115
He'’s my cousin.

51:58.289 --> 52:00.987
I'’m so sorry.
I just found out.
I'’m sorry.

52:01.161 --> 52:02.815
I'’m sorry.

52:09.126 --> 52:11.519
What'’s the beard
all about?

52:14.435 --> 52:16.742
Are you going
some place, Jimmy?

52:22.051 --> 52:24.489
You were right
to start packing.

52:25.707 --> 52:28.623
We need to get
all of this shit
out of here.

52:28.797 --> 52:30.277
Clear out.

52:30.451 --> 52:32.410
Look, Nick,
I'’m taking my cut

52:32.584 --> 52:34.716
and, and Reggie
and Matteo'’s cut.

52:34.890 --> 52:36.370
In cash.

52:36.544 --> 52:38.416
My aunt will pay
for Reggie'’s funeral.

52:38.590 --> 52:40.679
Matteo can do
whatever the fuck Matteo does,
and I'’m out of here.

52:40.853 --> 52:42.637
No, that was not our deal.

52:42.811 --> 52:47.120
Okay? I take the cash,
and you guys
fence this shit.

52:47.294 --> 52:49.209
Besides, how do you think
it makes you look to run?

52:49.383 --> 52:53.170
I gotta be
the dumbest person alive
to ever trusted you.

52:54.388 --> 52:55.911
"Jimmy, he owes me.

52:56.999 --> 53:00.177
Oh, I never done this
before. Help me."

53:01.482 --> 53:03.528
You got me back
into this, Nick.

53:05.878 --> 53:09.055
I'’m sorry. I will get you
out of it. I promise.

53:09.229 --> 53:12.319
But we helped each other.
Remember with Reggie?

53:12.493 --> 53:14.191
You got promoted.

53:14.365 --> 53:18.369
And-and Ben Myers used to
take care of people, Nick,

53:18.543 --> 53:20.762
for the mob.

53:20.936 --> 53:24.288
I can tell you that Ben Myers
is an old man dying of cancer.

53:24.462 --> 53:26.420
He'’s crying
in the back of his bar

53:26.594 --> 53:28.596
because he has no leads.
He has no idea who did this.

53:28.770 --> 53:30.642
Or does he?
Did you screw up?

53:30.816 --> 53:31.904
No.

53:32.078 --> 53:33.471
So why are you running?

53:34.428 --> 53:37.475
I want my cut
in cash today.

53:37.649 --> 53:39.912
All right.
It'’s not safe.That cash...

53:41.000 --> 53:43.220
is my sister'’s kids'’
last chance.

53:44.438 --> 53:46.745
The cash goes with me,
Jimmy. Period.

53:47.833 --> 53:49.661
Like our deal was, okay?

53:52.054 --> 53:54.187
My life'’s not worth this,
Nick.

53:55.014 --> 53:56.450
Stop.

53:57.321 --> 53:59.540
No, it'’s not. I'’m sorry.

53:59.714 --> 54:02.064
Jimmy, you got to turn around
from that table right now.

54:02.239 --> 54:04.458
You got to show me
your hands. I'’m sorry.

54:04.632 --> 54:08.245
Please turn around. Slowly.
Don'’t even think of...

54:15.034 --> 54:16.035
That'’s what this is?

54:17.689 --> 54:18.646
The hell with me.

54:18.820 --> 54:19.908
No!

54:21.345 --> 54:23.303
Matteo knows who you are.

54:23.477 --> 54:25.740
Yo, he ain'’t stupid.
He figured it out.

54:25.914 --> 54:29.222
You need me, '’less you wanna
explain all of this to him.

54:29.396 --> 54:31.268
Officer.

54:31.442 --> 54:34.706
Okay, so let'’s you and me
just wait here
for the cops to show up.

54:34.880 --> 54:36.969
'’Cause they'’re going to come
looking for Reggie'’s stash.

54:37.143 --> 54:39.101
Something'’s going to tip
them off, you know, like a,

54:39.276 --> 54:43.192
a receipt for the storage or,
or, or a lock combination.

54:43.367 --> 54:45.499
And then they'’ll just
bring us in,

54:45.673 --> 54:48.502
but I'’m going to take care
of you. I'’m going to
protect you.

54:48.676 --> 54:50.896
You just lay low, all right?

54:51.070 --> 54:54.421
You play your cards right,
it'’ll all be fixed soon.

54:54.595 --> 54:56.118
Okay?

55:00.079 --> 55:01.298
What'’s this?

55:01.472 --> 55:02.908
That'’s for Reggie'’s funeral.

55:03.082 --> 55:06.912
It'’s not "running away
out of town" money.

55:07.086 --> 55:09.915
Its for his mom.
It'’s to do right by him.

55:11.046 --> 55:13.135
Okay? Just for now.

55:15.442 --> 55:17.444
Just hang on
a little bit longer.

55:28.716 --> 55:29.978
Fine.

55:31.458 --> 55:32.720
It'’s all yours.

55:33.852 --> 55:35.897
That'’s yours. What am I
gonna do with it?

55:36.071 --> 55:37.856
Oh, come on, man.

55:47.648 --> 55:49.215
A major rally
in the Sanctuary

55:49.389 --> 55:51.260
of Christ the Redeemer
Baptist Church this evening

55:51.435 --> 55:53.872
is intended to introduce
Congressman John Billings

55:54.046 --> 55:56.309
to his new Hispanic majority
constituency.

55:56.483 --> 55:59.051
A group
he often antagonized... Ben, you okay?

55:59.225 --> 56:01.270
...in Congress will now
decide his fate.

56:01.445 --> 56:03.272
Hey, Ben!

56:04.056 --> 56:06.319
Yeah. I'’m okay.Yeah?

56:09.061 --> 56:10.932
Reggie McIntyre,
a local handyman...

56:11.106 --> 56:13.021
I got to talk to you,
boss.Shut up!

56:13.195 --> 56:16.285
...was found dead inside
his San Juan home... Just a minute.

56:16.460 --> 56:19.027
I'’m on location at the home
of the victim'’s mother

56:19.201 --> 56:21.203
in the Grayland
section of Aurora,

56:21.378 --> 56:23.728
where mourners
and well-wishers

56:23.902 --> 56:26.165
are gathering to
offer their condolences

56:26.339 --> 56:29.124
Hey, Ben!
It'’s real important.
Just a minute.

56:29.298 --> 56:30.822
Shut up!

56:31.431 --> 56:33.390
And shut that door.

56:33.564 --> 56:36.741
Please call the Channel 7
Stop Crime Now Line.

56:36.915 --> 56:39.047
They do suspect foul play,

56:39.221 --> 56:41.049
and they'’re currently
canvassing the neighborhood.

56:41.223 --> 56:42.877
I got Phil
covering for me.

56:43.051 --> 56:45.445
You want me
to leave the envelope
in case Ray'’s early?

56:45.619 --> 56:47.447
Where the hell
do you think you'’re going?

56:48.405 --> 56:49.928
The dump. The barrel.

56:50.102 --> 56:53.061
Oh! Right. Good.

56:54.628 --> 56:57.414
Um, is there something
on your mind, boss?

56:57.588 --> 56:59.024
Nope.

57:01.505 --> 57:03.071
You need anything, Ben?

57:03.245 --> 57:04.769
No. No, no.

57:06.510 --> 57:09.121
I got this.
I got this covered.

57:19.610 --> 57:21.699
Yes, no. She told me about
that this morning, sir.

57:21.873 --> 57:24.266
I just found out.
Nick, that is your job.

57:24.441 --> 57:25.790
No, I agree
that it'’s a problem.

57:25.964 --> 57:28.096
They can'’t do this.

57:28.270 --> 57:30.534
No, I'’m definitely going to
take care of this for you, sir.

57:30.708 --> 57:32.797
I-I just had a real
bear of a morning.

57:32.971 --> 57:36.191
They'’ve called me into
the station, and I had
to do something, so...

57:36.365 --> 57:39.717
I'’ll be there soon.
I'’m almost done. Okay?

57:39.891 --> 57:43.329
I will take care of all
of your crowd control needs.

57:43.503 --> 57:45.549
See you shortly. Fine, bye.

58:06.744 --> 58:11.270
Oh, my goodness.
Hey, they got so big.

58:11.444 --> 58:14.316
Hi, sweetheart.
Can I have a little hug?

58:14.491 --> 58:18.451
Oh. I missed you
so much. Wow!

58:18.625 --> 58:23.282
Maybe I could take '’em to
the park sometime, just for
a little play, a little visit?

58:23.456 --> 58:26.024
Just for fun?
All right, never mind.

58:26.198 --> 58:28.026
No, not the-- We won'’t
talk about that right now.

58:28.200 --> 58:31.464
I have something else
I want to ask you. Um...

58:31.638 --> 58:34.032
I want to know if you can
hold onto something for me.

58:34.206 --> 58:35.642
What is it?

58:35.816 --> 58:39.559
It'’s the key to my locker
at the law school gym.

58:39.733 --> 58:41.822
You dropped the law school.

58:41.996 --> 58:45.826
I know, but, um,
I still have my ID.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.350
It'’s just in case
something happened to me.

58:48.525 --> 58:50.831
I just want you to have
what'’s inside the locker.

58:51.005 --> 58:53.747
What'’s going to happen
to you?

58:53.921 --> 58:57.577
Nothing, nothing'’s
going to happen to me.
Just...

58:57.751 --> 59:02.234
I could call Daddy.
I'’d like to see him.

59:02.408 --> 59:05.498
You know who you should call
is you should call Joanne.
Do you remember Joanne?

59:05.672 --> 59:08.675
Joanne was the one
who helped us with Mom.

59:08.849 --> 59:10.068
Joanne can use my ID,

59:10.242 --> 59:11.896
and she can go back
to the law school

59:12.070 --> 59:13.985
and get everything
that'’s in the locker
for you.

59:14.159 --> 59:16.509
I could ask the church.

59:16.683 --> 59:18.859
The people at the church
are so kind.

59:19.033 --> 59:22.297
Honey, I don'’t want the people
in your church taking it

59:22.471 --> 59:24.561
and giving it
to your preacher.

59:24.735 --> 59:27.476
And I don'’t want
some so-called friend
shooting it up your arm.

59:27.651 --> 59:28.826
Okay?

59:32.743 --> 59:36.181
Can you keep a secret?
Okay?

59:36.355 --> 59:39.880
Daddy gave you a present,
and that'’s what'’s
in the locker.

59:40.054 --> 59:42.709
You talk to Daddy?Yeah.

59:43.710 --> 59:45.625
Okay.Okay?

59:45.799 --> 59:47.496
Right, so this is a key.

59:47.671 --> 59:50.282
I want you to put it
in a very safe place. Okay?

59:53.241 --> 59:56.114
Matilda? Okay.

59:56.288 --> 1:00:00.858
And then, if you have to,
here'’s Jo'’s number.

1:00:04.339 --> 1:00:05.645
You just call Joanne.

1:00:06.820 --> 1:00:09.562
What'’s going to
happen to you?

1:00:09.736 --> 1:00:13.261
Nothing. I'’m just working
for the congressman tonight.
That'’s all.

1:00:14.088 --> 1:00:15.612
I just might be busy.

1:00:18.745 --> 1:00:20.486
Will you say hi to Daddy?

1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:22.662
Why do you miss him
so much?

1:00:24.272 --> 1:00:25.709
I love Daddy.

1:00:28.363 --> 1:00:29.887
He loves you, too.

1:00:39.897 --> 1:00:43.552
Staking out Reggie'’s wake
was the only lead I had.

1:01:03.877 --> 1:01:04.922
Jimmy!

1:01:05.096 --> 1:01:06.967
Yo, Jimmy!

1:01:10.188 --> 1:01:12.277
It'’s me, Stokes.

1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:15.236
What up, Stokes?

1:01:17.021 --> 1:01:18.805
How you doing, man?
Looking good.

1:01:18.979 --> 1:01:21.416
G-O-D-D good.

1:01:22.679 --> 1:01:26.030
Man, I like the beard.
Stylish. Sharp.

1:01:27.727 --> 1:01:30.512
That'’s a motherfucker,
He shouldn'’t go out like that.

1:01:30.687 --> 1:01:33.385
Yeah, man,
I'’m sorry to hear.
I saw your aunt earlier.

1:01:33.559 --> 1:01:37.171
Sorry about your cousin,
Reggie. He was good people.

1:01:37.345 --> 1:01:40.305
Tell you what,
you and the family,
you need anything,

1:01:40.479 --> 1:01:42.481
you know where
to reach me. Right?

1:01:42.655 --> 1:01:44.178
All right, man.
I appreciate you.All right, B.

1:01:44.352 --> 1:01:46.050
Thanks for coming out.Stay strong, man,
all right?

1:01:46.224 --> 1:01:48.226
Appreciate you.

1:03:18.011 --> 1:03:20.405
I wanted to know...

1:03:22.059 --> 1:03:24.104
who had done this to me.

1:03:25.410 --> 1:03:27.281
Yeah, yo, Matteo.

1:03:27.455 --> 1:03:30.981
Nah. No, no, no,
I ain'’t got it, all right?

1:03:31.155 --> 1:03:34.158
Hey, Matteo. Matteo.
Listen, man, I'’m out.

1:03:34.332 --> 1:03:36.725
All right, I'’m gone.

1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:39.467
You want, you want it?
You want your cut?

1:03:39.641 --> 1:03:41.339
All right,
deal with the girl.

1:03:43.341 --> 1:03:45.038
Yo... No. No.

1:03:46.387 --> 1:03:48.215
Hey, stop.

1:03:48.389 --> 1:03:51.784
We'’re on a cell, man.
Stop talking, all right?

1:03:51.958 --> 1:03:53.307
Yeah, yeah,
I will come see you.

1:03:53.481 --> 1:03:55.483
But I ain'’t got nothing.

1:03:55.657 --> 1:03:57.224
All right, all right. Yeah.

1:03:57.398 --> 1:04:00.619
I wanted to know
who had done this to us.

1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:03.448
I was gonna find out.

1:04:04.188 --> 1:04:05.537
What the--

1:04:05.711 --> 1:04:08.148
Put your foot
on the brake right now.

1:04:08.322 --> 1:04:09.933
Why are you doing this
to me?

1:04:10.107 --> 1:04:13.719
Stop the goddamned car.
Stop the car!

1:04:13.893 --> 1:04:15.982
Come on, put your foot
on the brake.

1:04:17.723 --> 1:04:19.246
Put your foot on the brake.
Stop it!

1:04:23.207 --> 1:04:26.601
Who are you working--
Goddamn it!

1:04:53.672 --> 1:04:57.110
Where you at, J?
You pulling up?

1:04:57.284 --> 1:04:58.982
Look, some spooky
shit'’s going on, man.

1:05:02.507 --> 1:05:03.508
It'’s me.

1:05:18.436 --> 1:05:21.526
Jimmy, I can'’t talk right now.
I'’ll have to hit you up
after the rally.

1:05:24.007 --> 1:05:26.618
-This would never be enough.
-

1:05:26.792 --> 1:05:29.490
And, uh, we'’re gonna
need this, too.

1:05:32.885 --> 1:05:34.931
Jimmy? Hello?

1:05:36.106 --> 1:05:37.803
New phone?

1:05:37.977 --> 1:05:40.240
Hey, sorry about that.

1:05:42.460 --> 1:05:44.331
They'’ll be here, sir.Well, let'’s hope so.

1:05:44.505 --> 1:05:46.855
And that'’s why you'’ve
got to get the city
to close the street.

1:05:47.030 --> 1:05:48.248
I'’ll get right back
on that, sir.

1:05:48.422 --> 1:05:49.858
Okay, thank you.

1:06:05.048 --> 1:06:07.354
We'’re going to
smoke '’em out, Tommy.

1:06:09.617 --> 1:06:13.099
Now if you'’re
not up to it--No, Ben, I-I got it.

1:06:13.273 --> 1:06:14.579
I don'’t want
any fingerprints.

1:06:14.753 --> 1:06:16.363
And there are
cameras everywhere.

1:06:16.537 --> 1:06:19.323
No. I got the parts
figured out, Ben, I will.

1:06:19.497 --> 1:06:22.239
It'’s just, are you sure?

1:06:22.413 --> 1:06:24.241
I mean, this is
about Nick, isn'’t it?

1:06:24.415 --> 1:06:27.244
Are you
giving me your opinion?

1:06:27.418 --> 1:06:28.680
No.

1:06:30.029 --> 1:06:32.901
The-- Ben, the congressman.

1:06:33.076 --> 1:06:34.686
This, this is big.

1:06:34.860 --> 1:06:38.211
Okay. That'’s it, right?
Right.

1:06:39.430 --> 1:06:42.215
Well, neither of them
would be there without me.

1:06:42.389 --> 1:06:47.177
And I'’m going to make
damn sure that they
never forget it.

1:06:48.395 --> 1:06:51.137
Now does this meet
with your approval?

1:06:51.311 --> 1:06:55.968
Tons could go wrong.
That'’s all I'’m saying.

1:06:58.144 --> 1:07:01.191
Tommy. Tommy.

1:07:01.365 --> 1:07:04.629
We'’re just gonna
scare '’em. Okay?

1:07:05.586 --> 1:07:06.979
That'’s it.

1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:10.113
Are you with me?

1:07:12.115 --> 1:07:13.290
Of course I am.

1:07:13.464 --> 1:07:16.206
Okay. Now...

1:07:26.042 --> 1:07:28.261
Hey. What?

1:07:28.435 --> 1:07:32.352
What, what?
Everything you'’re going
to need is in that bag.

1:07:32.526 --> 1:07:35.573
You need... stuff.
You got things
you got to do.

1:07:35.747 --> 1:07:38.706
What am I gonna do with it?
I'’ve got weeks to live.

1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:40.969
Hey! Hey, come on,
don'’t...

1:07:41.144 --> 1:07:43.711
Don'’t do that! Mm-mmm!

1:07:43.885 --> 1:07:46.279
You know, you'’re afraid
of the words.

1:07:46.453 --> 1:07:47.889
I'’m dying.

1:07:52.459 --> 1:07:54.026
You'’re dying.

1:07:58.378 --> 1:08:01.512
This is how you want
to spend your time?

1:08:03.688 --> 1:08:04.993
No.

1:08:06.865 --> 1:08:08.649
With what she did...

1:08:08.823 --> 1:08:10.869
You tell me, huh?

1:08:13.437 --> 1:08:17.093
After what she did.

1:08:18.311 --> 1:08:23.011
I want you to
take care of yourself.

1:08:26.972 --> 1:08:29.583
Don'’t let Ray
give you any shit.

1:08:30.976 --> 1:08:32.238
Okay.

1:08:34.197 --> 1:08:35.807
Okay, Ben.

1:08:58.525 --> 1:09:00.571
Hey, Ray.Yeah?

1:09:00.745 --> 1:09:02.573
These things aren'’t going
to hurt anybody, right?

1:09:02.747 --> 1:09:05.576
No, they'’re all poof.
Just like you, Tommy.

1:09:07.795 --> 1:09:10.058
You'’ve just gotta remember...

1:09:11.451 --> 1:09:14.280
to set the timer,
and wait.

1:09:15.586 --> 1:09:17.805
But from a distance.

1:09:40.045 --> 1:09:42.656
Ha, you can'’t lose a person.
You can'’t lose them.

1:09:42.830 --> 1:09:44.484
We have no record
of her.All right?

1:09:44.658 --> 1:09:47.226
Her name is Nan Myers.
She checked in this morning.

1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:50.621
Now, don'’t--
don'’t tell me that--

1:09:50.795 --> 1:09:52.231
That'’s my wife.
Hold it. Hold it.

1:09:52.405 --> 1:09:53.798
Mr. Myers.

1:09:53.972 --> 1:09:55.974
Hey, stop moving!

1:09:58.281 --> 1:10:03.068
Look, I just want
to talk to my wife. Okay?

1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:11.468
I wanna talk to my wife.
Alone. Please.

1:10:13.774 --> 1:10:14.906
Thank you.

1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:16.647
Thank you very much.

1:10:17.343 --> 1:10:19.171
Thank you very much.

1:10:32.053 --> 1:10:33.664
Oh, Nan.

1:10:36.406 --> 1:10:40.671
I swore that you would not
wind up in a place like this.

1:10:47.286 --> 1:10:48.418
Maybe...

1:10:49.984 --> 1:10:51.725
Maybe it'’ll be okay.

1:10:53.249 --> 1:10:55.207
At least you won'’t remember.

1:10:59.429 --> 1:11:03.041
Nan, I don'’t know
how you do that. Just...

1:11:03.868 --> 1:11:06.131
Just let it go.

1:11:06.914 --> 1:11:08.525
I wish I could do that.

1:11:08.699 --> 1:11:12.398
To just let it--
let it go.

1:11:17.403 --> 1:11:19.797
I wish we had more time.

1:11:21.755 --> 1:11:24.802
And I mean just time
with you.

1:11:27.718 --> 1:11:30.111
I'’ve had enough time
with me.

1:11:35.856 --> 1:11:37.467
I love you, Nan.

1:12:30.694 --> 1:12:32.260
This is all
going to go terrific.

1:12:32.435 --> 1:12:34.088
Yeah, yeah.

1:12:34.262 --> 1:12:36.264
No, Alan. If this
goes south tonight,

1:12:36.439 --> 1:12:38.963
this is going to be your career
on the line, and I will
make sure of it.

1:12:39.137 --> 1:12:42.749
I did exactly what I used to
when we put these
together in Lowery.

1:12:42.923 --> 1:12:44.403
In Lowery?

1:12:44.577 --> 1:12:46.405
We'’re not in Lowery
anymore, sweetie.

1:12:46.579 --> 1:12:48.059
Okay, so when the
Mayor'’s Office calls

1:12:48.233 --> 1:12:49.800
and says they
can'’t regulate traffic

1:12:49.974 --> 1:12:52.063
or provide security
outside for our event,

1:12:52.237 --> 1:12:54.587
because "no one is coming,"

1:12:54.761 --> 1:12:56.154
you should share that
with me.

1:12:56.328 --> 1:12:58.286
'’Cause you think
it'’s a problem.

1:12:58.461 --> 1:13:01.289
'’Cause it'’s a big giant
"fuck you," Carrie. Okay?

1:13:01.464 --> 1:13:03.291
How do I get these people
to vote for me

1:13:03.466 --> 1:13:06.904
if I can not get their mayor
to take me fucking
seriously? Jesus!

1:13:07.078 --> 1:13:09.776
I don'’t care
how many people
you think are coming.

1:13:09.950 --> 1:13:11.648
The Mayor'’s Office
will regret

1:13:11.822 --> 1:13:14.477
not adequately
protecting your citizens
and your congressman.

1:13:14.651 --> 1:13:16.392
Excuse me?

1:13:16.566 --> 1:13:17.610
What'’d he say?

1:13:18.785 --> 1:13:21.048
He said congressman
for now...

1:13:21.222 --> 1:13:22.876
I'’m sorry.

1:13:23.050 --> 1:13:25.401
Fuck. Fucking disgrace.

1:13:31.668 --> 1:13:33.409
Maybe this isn'’t
the best time

1:13:33.583 --> 1:13:36.020
because he'’s not
expecting this today.

1:13:36.194 --> 1:13:37.848
Maybe some other day.

1:13:38.022 --> 1:13:40.981
Forget it, Mommy.
Forget it. No, forget it.

1:13:41.155 --> 1:13:44.985
I really need you to
calm down and understand
that some--

1:13:45.159 --> 1:13:48.206
Yonny!
What are you doing? Hey!

1:13:48.380 --> 1:13:50.730
We'’re not blocking anybody
if we go to sit up there.

1:13:55.431 --> 1:13:58.912
We ran the ads
and did the promotions,
but like you said,

1:13:59.086 --> 1:14:01.828
we'’re not
in Lowery anymore.

1:14:04.918 --> 1:14:06.267
Are they there?

1:14:13.057 --> 1:14:15.842
There'’s enough people
to make this work, John.

1:14:16.016 --> 1:14:17.670
Oh!Oh, sir. Are you okay?

1:14:17.844 --> 1:14:19.193
Where'’s your father?What?

1:14:21.065 --> 1:14:22.632
I'’m good. I'’m good.
I'’m fine. I'’m fine.

1:14:22.806 --> 1:14:23.937
I-I got this, Nick.

1:14:25.635 --> 1:14:29.726
John. John,
just relax okay?I'’m fine.

1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:32.555
Hello?

1:14:32.729 --> 1:14:34.905
I know who robbed
your father'’s house
this morning.

1:14:35.079 --> 1:14:36.472
You know who this is?

1:14:36.646 --> 1:14:38.648
No. Who is this?

1:14:38.822 --> 1:14:40.563
I, I, I-- How did you
get this number?

1:14:40.737 --> 1:14:42.129
I called
the police station.

1:14:42.303 --> 1:14:44.305
I told them your father
had an emergency.

1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:47.613
Listen, uh, Jimmy'’s gone.
Like, disappeared.

1:14:47.787 --> 1:14:49.180
Like, somebody'’s after us.

1:14:49.354 --> 1:14:52.575
I'’m sorry. I think
you have the wrong number.

1:14:52.749 --> 1:14:54.838
Relax. Relax.
I'’m on a pay phone.

1:14:55.012 --> 1:14:56.579
I'’m not stupid.

1:14:56.753 --> 1:14:58.406
But Jimmy'’s dead, probably.

1:14:58.581 --> 1:15:00.931
And I want my cut now.

1:15:01.105 --> 1:15:02.933
I-I don'’t know any Jimmy.

1:15:03.107 --> 1:15:05.849
You'’re not listening!
Your pops is after me.

1:15:06.023 --> 1:15:08.895
This isn'’t safe.
I'’m not waiting.

1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:16.076
Listen, I disappear tonight.
I get my money tonight.

1:15:16.250 --> 1:15:20.211
After this rally, you'’re going
to bring me what'’s mine.

1:15:20.385 --> 1:15:22.430
I do not know who you are.

1:15:22.605 --> 1:15:25.129
I cannot help you.
And do not call
this number again.

1:15:25.303 --> 1:15:26.522
Mother--

1:15:32.702 --> 1:15:33.920
Hey, Nick.

1:15:34.965 --> 1:15:36.357
Wow, you don'’t look
so good.

1:15:36.532 --> 1:15:38.403
Was that your dad
on the phone?

1:15:38.577 --> 1:15:39.839
No, sir.

1:15:42.538 --> 1:15:44.104
I want you to look over
your left shoulder

1:15:44.278 --> 1:15:47.368
and tell me if you see
a 31-year-old
Guatemalan woman

1:15:47.543 --> 1:15:49.414
and her son in the
front pew of the church,

1:15:49.588 --> 1:15:51.503
and then tell me what the
fuck they are doing here.

1:15:51.677 --> 1:15:53.505
So you--

1:15:53.679 --> 1:15:55.507
I mean, there are two
individuals that match

1:15:55.681 --> 1:15:58.597
that description down there.
Do you want me to talk to them?

1:16:02.775 --> 1:16:04.385
Okay.

1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:08.346
Maybe I misjudged
the situation, but, Nick,

1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:10.957
don'’t ever misjudge me.

1:16:11.131 --> 1:16:15.266
In or out of office,
never misjudge me.

1:16:16.310 --> 1:16:17.877
Never, sir.

1:16:24.362 --> 1:16:26.886
We'’re live in Christ
the Redeemer Sanctuary,

1:16:27.060 --> 1:16:30.194
where embattled
US Congressman John Billings
of the 4th district,

1:16:30.368 --> 1:16:34.285
is introducing himself
to a small group
of undecided voters.

1:16:34.459 --> 1:16:36.809
Having just lost
his redistricting appeal,

1:16:36.983 --> 1:16:41.901
Congressman Billings must now
try to win over a largely
Hispanic constituency,

1:16:42.075 --> 1:16:45.601
a group he once denounced
as freeloaders and illegals.

1:16:45.775 --> 1:16:47.341
He has his work
cut out for him.

1:16:47.515 --> 1:16:49.779
And do you know
what he said to me?

1:16:49.953 --> 1:16:54.305
He said to me, "Honey,
we'’re not in Lowery anymore."

1:16:55.436 --> 1:16:57.656
So, I don'’t want to take up
any more time.

1:16:57.830 --> 1:16:59.615
I know you'’re excited
to hear from him.

1:16:59.789 --> 1:17:03.575
Please let me introduce to you
my husband of 15 years

1:17:03.749 --> 1:17:07.405
and your congressman,
John Billings.

1:17:10.626 --> 1:17:12.671
Mwah!
Now go sit down.

1:17:12.845 --> 1:17:14.804
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1:17:14.978 --> 1:17:17.502
Thank you so much.
Good evening. Um...

1:17:31.429 --> 1:17:33.126
Thank you very much.
Come on.

1:17:33.300 --> 1:17:34.911
He worked so hard.

1:17:35.085 --> 1:17:36.913
Thank you very much.

1:17:37.087 --> 1:17:40.090
It is always a great honor
for me to come
and greet my constituents.

1:17:40.264 --> 1:17:43.659
It is my firm belief
that a representative

1:17:43.833 --> 1:17:46.749
to the Congress
of the United States
has one job.

1:17:46.923 --> 1:17:49.752
And that is to represent
the views, needs and dreams

1:17:49.926 --> 1:17:53.233
of the people of the district
that he represents.

1:17:56.976 --> 1:17:59.718
And I have a
good track record

1:17:59.892 --> 1:18:01.502
in delivering
on those dreams.

1:18:01.677 --> 1:18:04.592
And also,
unlike my opponent,

1:18:04.767 --> 1:18:08.205
nothing was handed to me
on a silver platter.

1:18:08.379 --> 1:18:11.251
Every blessing
the Lord has bestowed upon me,

1:18:11.425 --> 1:18:13.210
I had to work for.

1:18:13.384 --> 1:18:15.865
I had to work
really hard.

1:18:16.039 --> 1:18:19.129
Um, I wanted
to go to college.

1:18:19.303 --> 1:18:21.174
I really wanted
to go to college.

1:18:21.348 --> 1:18:23.699
I couldn'’t afford it,

1:18:23.873 --> 1:18:26.440
so, I joined the army
when I was 16

1:18:26.614 --> 1:18:30.009
and I went to Kuwait and
fought in the first Gulf War

1:18:30.183 --> 1:18:32.359
with an
artillery battery.

1:18:32.533 --> 1:18:37.277
I came home.
I went to college,
courtesy of the Army.

1:18:37.451 --> 1:18:41.238
And then much to the horror
of some of my army colleagues...

1:18:43.327 --> 1:18:46.112
...I took a commission
in the United States
Marine Corps

1:18:46.286 --> 1:18:48.593
and had the great honor
of serving

1:18:48.767 --> 1:18:51.378
in Operation
Enduring Freedom in Iraq.

1:18:51.552 --> 1:18:55.121
I think it'’s fair
to say that my career
can be defined

1:18:55.295 --> 1:18:57.254
as serving my country...

1:18:57.428 --> 1:19:00.605
...serving my
fellow Americans,

1:19:00.779 --> 1:19:03.173
Americans just like you.

1:19:07.481 --> 1:19:10.310
I'’d have given anything
to see her face.

1:19:10.484 --> 1:19:12.748
And for her to see mine.

1:19:18.797 --> 1:19:22.758
Sit down! Sit down!

1:19:22.932 --> 1:19:24.890
All units converge...

1:19:25.064 --> 1:19:27.110
It'’s okay.
Sweetie, it'’s fine.

1:19:27.284 --> 1:19:29.547
...Christ the Redeemer
Sanctuary, protests
have broken out.

1:19:29.721 --> 1:19:31.114
Converge! Converge!

1:19:31.288 --> 1:19:33.638
I need all available units.

1:19:33.812 --> 1:19:35.901
Sit down! Sit down!

1:19:40.427 --> 1:19:43.822
Get down. Get down.
Let them do their job.

1:19:43.996 --> 1:19:47.173
Possible riot in Christ
the Redeemer Sanctuary.

1:19:49.262 --> 1:19:50.742
All units,
please respond.

1:19:50.916 --> 1:19:53.440
Please, please, please.
Are you all right, miss?

1:19:53.614 --> 1:19:55.573
Are you okay? You sure?

1:19:55.747 --> 1:19:58.794
Get them outside.
Get them out of here
to a medic right now.

1:20:01.274 --> 1:20:04.625
Let me help her.
I can help her. I need my bag, please?

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:08.586
Let me help her.
I can help. Please let me.

1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:11.328
This is Perimeter 3.Go for Nick.

1:20:13.417 --> 1:20:16.899
Sanctuary, Northwest Corner.
I'’ve got bombs going off
out here.

1:20:17.073 --> 1:20:18.857
Oh, shit,
I'’ve gotta call it.

1:20:19.031 --> 1:20:23.122
Ladies and gentlemen,
I need you to quickly
and quietly exit

1:20:23.296 --> 1:20:25.211
through the exits
in the back.

1:20:25.385 --> 1:20:26.517
What'’s happening?

1:20:26.691 --> 1:20:28.171
Sir, explosions,
you'’ve gotta go.

1:20:28.345 --> 1:20:29.912
Put him in the box
and the missus too.

1:20:30.086 --> 1:20:31.522
Get them out now,
quickly.

1:20:31.696 --> 1:20:33.350
Go on, get out of here.

1:20:33.524 --> 1:20:35.439
Although we
can'’t determine at this time

1:20:35.613 --> 1:20:38.007
if there have been any
injuries or any arrests...

1:20:38.181 --> 1:20:39.965
People, I need you
to move faster.

1:20:40.139 --> 1:20:42.272
The congressman'’s own detail
tried to break it up...

1:20:42.446 --> 1:20:44.709
If anyone'’s up in the
balcony please call out!

1:20:44.883 --> 1:20:46.842
Becky, we gotta go.
Let'’s do this outside.
Come on.

1:20:47.016 --> 1:20:48.539
Like I said,
this is not a drill.

1:20:48.713 --> 1:20:50.628
Guys, get him
out of here. Come on!

1:20:50.802 --> 1:20:53.239
All right,
the congressman'’s safe.

1:21:08.602 --> 1:21:11.127
Why?
Why did you do this?

1:21:16.523 --> 1:21:20.614
Now, why did you
do this?

1:21:21.789 --> 1:21:24.009
Why did you kill Reggie?

1:21:25.619 --> 1:21:27.143
Jimmy?

1:21:27.317 --> 1:21:32.061
Everyone you touch,
winds up dead.

1:21:32.235 --> 1:21:36.195
Me and Sherry, Dad,
we'’re dying on the inside.

1:21:38.589 --> 1:21:40.069
That'’s life.

1:21:42.158 --> 1:21:43.289
Really?

1:21:50.818 --> 1:21:53.647
I can take care of her.
Mom, I'’m right here.

1:21:56.302 --> 1:21:58.652
My SUV'’s
across the street. I'’m right here.

1:22:00.959 --> 1:22:04.658
Yonny, come here.I'’m right here,
stay with me, please.

1:22:05.311 --> 1:22:06.878
You made this happen.

1:22:07.618 --> 1:22:09.185
Everybody chooses.

1:22:09.359 --> 1:22:11.491
I don'’t want any more
of your stupid lessons.

1:22:11.665 --> 1:22:13.841
All of this,
you brought on yourself,

1:22:14.016 --> 1:22:15.539
so I want you
to think about that

1:22:15.713 --> 1:22:17.062
as you'’re heading
towards your grave.

1:22:17.236 --> 1:22:18.759
Including what you did
to Nan?

1:22:18.934 --> 1:22:21.153
What I did to Nan?Including
what you did to Nan?

1:22:21.327 --> 1:22:22.850
Good, shoot me!
Go ahead, shoot me!

1:22:23.025 --> 1:22:24.852
Everybody--Just do it!

1:22:26.550 --> 1:22:28.595
You never listen.

1:22:28.769 --> 1:22:31.511
Stay with me, Mom.Yonny, Yonny!

1:22:31.685 --> 1:22:33.644
Yonny!Mom!

1:22:33.818 --> 1:22:35.907
Yonny!Mom!

1:22:36.081 --> 1:22:38.040
I think what you did
was a lot worse, Dad,

1:22:38.214 --> 1:22:40.042
but you never want
to see your own flaws.

1:22:40.216 --> 1:22:42.870
You never ever want to take
any responsibility for anything.

1:22:43.045 --> 1:22:45.177
You'’re so
fucking delusional.

1:22:45.351 --> 1:22:48.833
Why don'’t you ask
your congressman
about good and evil?

1:22:49.007 --> 1:22:52.271
I saved his maid
and their unborn child...

1:22:52.445 --> 1:22:55.318
Okay....from going
straight to hell.

1:22:55.492 --> 1:22:57.581
And I did that.

1:22:58.799 --> 1:23:01.237
Ugh, I'’m so finished.
Ask your congressman!

1:23:03.587 --> 1:23:06.546
I had no choice.
He was going to kill you.

1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:09.114
Why did you
hang up on me, lady?Dad...

1:23:09.288 --> 1:23:10.768
Give me my money!

1:23:12.509 --> 1:23:15.033
Where'’s Jimmy'’s phone?

1:23:15.207 --> 1:23:17.209
Mom! Let her go!

1:23:17.383 --> 1:23:19.385
Yonny!

1:23:23.085 --> 1:23:24.956
No! No!

1:23:25.130 --> 1:23:26.479
Put pressure on it.

1:23:37.447 --> 1:23:39.579
Yonny! Yonny!

1:23:42.887 --> 1:23:45.150
Help! Please!

1:23:46.630 --> 1:23:48.632
Freeze!
Freeze, drop the gun!

1:23:48.806 --> 1:23:51.722
Nick Wallace.
I'’m on the job.

1:23:51.896 --> 1:23:53.898
I got the shooter.
He was going
for the congressman.

1:23:58.903 --> 1:24:01.210
What was it for?

1:24:03.821 --> 1:24:07.781
Mr. Myers, are you on
any medications presently?

1:24:07.955 --> 1:24:10.045
Mr. Myers?

1:24:15.137 --> 1:24:17.400
Tommy?Yeah, Ben.

1:24:20.446 --> 1:24:22.274
Why aren'’t you
at the bar?

1:24:22.448 --> 1:24:24.581
It'’s not even
eight o'’clock yet, Ben.

1:24:26.278 --> 1:24:28.063
It'’s not even
eight o'’clock?

1:24:31.066 --> 1:24:32.415
In the morning?

1:24:35.766 --> 1:24:37.724
You want some help
with that?

1:24:37.898 --> 1:24:41.946
Uh, yeah. Thanks.
Um...

1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:45.732
Oh, just lift up the--
the thing.

1:24:47.299 --> 1:24:48.431
Yeah.

1:25:05.230 --> 1:25:06.710
That kid got hurt.

1:25:08.015 --> 1:25:12.455
That'’s on me.
'’Cause of what I did.

1:25:14.065 --> 1:25:18.243
Now, now, there'’s--
there'’s debts,
and there'’s life.

1:25:18.417 --> 1:25:22.160
But you can'’t do much living
with a-a life full of debts.

1:25:22.334 --> 1:25:27.165
Uh, Tommy,
uh, regret is shit.

1:25:28.340 --> 1:25:31.038
No matter where it starts,
it'’s shit, okay?

1:25:31.213 --> 1:25:35.347
And I, I need you
to go...

1:25:35.521 --> 1:25:37.436
Ben...Get my...

1:25:40.439 --> 1:25:43.877
I need you to go and get
my pants for me, Tommy.

1:25:45.966 --> 1:25:48.534
Go and get my pants
for me.

1:25:53.713 --> 1:25:57.369
Gonna get your pants.Oh, man, what the hell.

1:26:07.292 --> 1:26:09.207
Here. No, no,
wait, wait, wait.

1:26:09.381 --> 1:26:10.774
Don'’t go.

1:26:10.948 --> 1:26:15.126
Take the keys
to the bar.

1:26:16.432 --> 1:26:17.998
Aw...

1:26:18.695 --> 1:26:20.000
What?

1:26:23.308 --> 1:26:29.271
Tommy, you'’re here.
You'’re the only one here.

1:26:29.445 --> 1:26:30.620
No.

1:26:33.449 --> 1:26:35.712
Tommy, just...

1:26:52.468 --> 1:26:54.905
The hero.
Come on in, Nick.

1:26:55.079 --> 1:26:56.950
They'’re looking
at making you
a key to the city.

1:26:57.124 --> 1:26:59.126
Detective Wallace.

1:26:59.301 --> 1:27:02.347
I was hoping you and I
could go talk about
the Reggie McIntyre murders

1:27:02.521 --> 1:27:04.219
before you go
unlocking anything.

1:27:04.393 --> 1:27:06.482
I thought that was
all wrapped up.

1:27:06.656 --> 1:27:10.225
Matteo Higuera'’s good for him
and his cousin, Jimmy Newson?

1:27:10.399 --> 1:27:13.140
That'’s what
it looks like.That is what it looks like,

1:27:13.315 --> 1:27:16.056
but I wanted to tie up
a couple of loose ends
with Detective Wallace.

1:27:18.233 --> 1:27:20.452
I'’m sorry,
I'’d like to help you,

1:27:20.626 --> 1:27:23.325
but I don'’t really know
anything about Matteo.

1:27:23.499 --> 1:27:25.370
Never dealt with him?No.

1:27:25.544 --> 1:27:27.459
No reason to suspect
he'’d know you?

1:27:28.286 --> 1:27:29.896
Matteo didn'’t know me.

1:27:30.070 --> 1:27:32.072
Let'’s handle this after.

1:27:32.247 --> 1:27:33.900
Nick, you'’re due
at City General.

1:27:34.074 --> 1:27:35.859
The congressman'’s making
some sort of announcement,

1:27:36.033 --> 1:27:37.556
and they'’ve been
calling for you.

1:27:37.730 --> 1:27:40.167
You got it, Captain.
Congratulations, Detective.

1:27:40.342 --> 1:27:42.692
Put some ice on that shiner.
For the press conference.

1:27:42.866 --> 1:27:44.476
I'’ll catch up with you.

1:27:49.960 --> 1:27:51.831
We'’re going
to make a statement

1:27:52.005 --> 1:27:55.400
and then return to caring
for the people that we love.

1:27:55.574 --> 1:27:58.316
Uh, there will be
no questions.

1:27:58.490 --> 1:28:01.841
This out-of-control
government bureaucracy,

1:28:02.015 --> 1:28:07.586
nearly cost the life
of my son, Yonatan.

1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:10.415
Please, please, please!

1:28:10.589 --> 1:28:13.026
That young boy...

1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:17.727
mi hijo, is fighting
for his life right now.

1:28:17.901 --> 1:28:20.730
Thanks to a government
that for too long,

1:28:20.904 --> 1:28:22.471
has taken people
like him...

1:28:22.645 --> 1:28:25.996
Ms. Chavez, we'’ve done
everything we can for...

1:28:26.170 --> 1:28:27.650
Yonatan.

1:28:27.824 --> 1:28:30.043
We'’ve done everything we can
for Yonatan here.

1:28:30.217 --> 1:28:33.743
He'’s stable, but he sustained
some trauma to his
right frontal lobe.

1:28:33.917 --> 1:28:35.875
I had no idea.

1:28:36.049 --> 1:28:39.923
More concerningly,
he'’s fractured his L5,
T6 and T7 vertebrae,

1:28:40.097 --> 1:28:42.969
with accompanying edema
of the cord. Swelling.

1:28:43.143 --> 1:28:46.451
Will he get up again?
Will he walk?

1:28:46.625 --> 1:28:48.888
Ms. Chavez,
your son is tough

1:28:49.062 --> 1:28:50.977
and a real fighter.

1:28:51.151 --> 1:28:55.242
I used to live
like I was keeping the books.

1:28:55.417 --> 1:28:58.594
This is obviously
an extra-ordinarily
difficult time for you,

1:28:58.768 --> 1:29:01.945
and everyone at City General
is doing all we can...

1:29:02.119 --> 1:29:04.948
Different columns
for what I owed,

1:29:07.037 --> 1:29:09.561
what I still
had to settle...

1:29:15.828 --> 1:29:19.354
only now, the math
doesn'’t hold up.

1:29:23.270 --> 1:29:25.447
Now I gotta pay.

1:29:26.404 --> 1:29:27.623
Daddy?

1:29:30.974 --> 1:29:32.497
Hi, Sher.

1:29:35.108 --> 1:29:37.502
I knew you'’d come
to see me.

1:29:48.557 --> 1:29:54.301
Did your guys make
those pictures for you?

1:29:55.694 --> 1:29:58.610
My boys
made these for me.

1:30:02.092 --> 1:30:06.270
They... They drew '’em
right here.

1:30:12.711 --> 1:30:15.105
You would like my boys,
Daddy.

1:30:32.731 --> 1:30:34.690
Nicky-- Nicky came?

1:30:37.519 --> 1:30:40.217
Nicky came yesterday?Yeah.

1:30:44.743 --> 1:30:50.793
Did you know she still
goes to that law school?

1:30:51.750 --> 1:30:53.839
She said
it was a secret.

1:31:03.849 --> 1:31:05.503
Are you good, Daddy?

1:31:15.470 --> 1:31:16.688
Yeah.

1:31:19.256 --> 1:31:20.692
Yeah, I'’m good.

1:31:34.532 --> 1:31:36.360
This belongs to you.

1:31:39.232 --> 1:31:44.107
And you have to take
really good care of it.

1:31:45.325 --> 1:31:47.893
'’Cause it'’s for your boys.

1:32:12.614 --> 1:32:16.226
Yonatan...

1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:18.184
Yonatan, we love you!

1:32:23.494 --> 1:32:25.931
She'’s gonna keep it.

1:32:26.105 --> 1:32:27.367
Sherry?

1:32:30.414 --> 1:32:31.502
Yeah.

1:32:33.156 --> 1:32:36.289
And you'’re gonna help
with Nan, right?

1:32:38.640 --> 1:32:39.989
Yeah.

1:32:40.163 --> 1:32:43.470
So, we'’re square.

1:32:43.645 --> 1:32:46.517
Do you think
that makes us square?

1:32:50.565 --> 1:32:53.785
Three people are dead
because of us.

1:32:55.482 --> 1:32:57.223
There is a little boy

1:32:57.397 --> 1:33:00.183
who may never get to
tell his mother...

1:33:04.970 --> 1:33:06.145
Nicky...

1:33:09.584 --> 1:33:13.631
Nicky, you can'’t go back
to the beginning.

1:33:17.374 --> 1:33:21.073
You gotta, you gotta deal
with the choices you got.

1:33:22.335 --> 1:33:25.469
All I wanted to do
was help those boys.

1:33:25.643 --> 1:33:28.603
I didn'’t mean
to do all of this.

1:33:31.301 --> 1:33:32.694
Nicky...

1:33:36.306 --> 1:33:38.090
I killed a man.

1:33:38.917 --> 1:33:39.918
Yeah.

1:33:40.789 --> 1:33:42.878
And you robbed your father.

1:33:44.270 --> 1:33:47.404
So, is there
nothing left?

1:33:48.623 --> 1:33:50.450
There'’s just nothing?

1:33:50.625 --> 1:33:51.800
Nickel.

1:33:56.631 --> 1:33:59.851
I'’m, I'’m-- I'’m always...

1:34:03.899 --> 1:34:06.075
I don'’t know how to...

1:34:11.428 --> 1:34:14.997
I-I-- What do I say?

1:34:16.215 --> 1:34:17.564
Nicky...

1:34:19.958 --> 1:34:23.309
We make the best mistakes
we can.

1:34:30.273 --> 1:34:33.145
Oh, baby. Baby.

1:34:49.379 --> 1:34:51.163
Daddy.

1:34:53.252 --> 1:34:56.516
We make the best mistakes
we can.
