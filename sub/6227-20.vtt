WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.302
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.377 --> 00:03.844
Diana?
Mommy.

00:03.921 --> 00:06.515
Adalind, I'd like you to
meet Conrad Bonaparte.

00:06.590 --> 00:10.311
Your present relationship is very
unhealthy for you and Kelly.

00:10.802 --> 00:13.851
Your future is with us.
Not with the Grimm.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.811
Occultatum...
Libera.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.650
Theo Delano.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.857
Why are you following me?

00:24.066 --> 00:26.546
He's a Skalengeck who
joined Black Claw six months ago.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.237
So, Theo was Black Claw.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.197
We all need to start
watching our backs.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.702
You've
run out of time, Adalind.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.243
We need an answer. Now.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.249
Adalind!

00:36.578 --> 00:38.296
"I'm doing
something I have to do.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.549
"I don't expect you to ever
understand what I've done,

00:41.625 --> 00:44.174
"but it's the only way
to protect my children.

00:44.253 --> 00:47.723
"And I don't expect you to
believe this, but I love you.

00:48.632 --> 00:49.975
"I'm sorry."

01:06.984 --> 01:08.281
No!

01:08.819 --> 01:10.787
No, this is not
going to happen.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.930
Hello, this
is Detective Hank Griffin.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.007
Please leave a message.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.200
I'm here to see...
We know who you are.

01:48.692 --> 01:49.693
Ms. Schade has arrived.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.031
We'll get your bags.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.872
I'm glad
you're here.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.047
I would've sent a car.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.091
And then you would've found
out where Nick lives.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.293
I can't make it
that easy on you.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.798
Could have just called
the cab company.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.880
You assume
I took only one?

02:10.339 --> 02:11.807
You brought Kelly.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.884
I wasn't sure
what you'd do.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.140
Where's Diana?

02:16.219 --> 02:17.516
Now that you're here,
they will bring her.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.140
Why isn't she here now?

02:19.556 --> 02:20.728
Because they wanted to
make sure you came alone.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.984
Let me make something
perfectly clear.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.734
You and I do not have
complete control here.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.233
Welcome home.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.826
What are you
going to tell Nick?

02:30.901 --> 02:32.369
He's going to figure out
we're with you,

02:32.444 --> 02:33.661
and he's not going
to be happy about it.

02:33.737 --> 02:34.989
I'll deal with Burkhardt.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.574
He may just deal
with you, too.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.160
I'm sure he'd love to,
but now that Kelly's here,

02:39.242 --> 02:40.789
his options are limited.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.338
What if you lose
the election tomorrow?

02:43.413 --> 02:44.835
Will we still be here?

02:44.915 --> 02:47.589
You do realize that
Kelly's one of us.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.217
Mother's a Hexenbiest,
father's a Grimm.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.261
Nothing happens to my son.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.509
I'll treat him
as I would my own.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.469
That's reassuring.
You gave our daughter away.

02:58.804 --> 02:59.976
I know what
that did to you.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.815
And what it did to me,

03:02.599 --> 03:04.226
but now we have
Diana and Kelly.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.402
Like it or not,
we're a family.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.903
You made
the right decision.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.963
Renard!

03:41.471 --> 03:42.472
No!

03:49.020 --> 03:50.067
No.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.672
I killed him.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.755
It felt good.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.441
Do it.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.274
Come on, do it.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.862
I said do it.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.828
Show me what I am.

04:56.713 --> 04:57.805
No.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.193
Uh...

05:16.233 --> 05:17.485
No. No. No.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.737
I have to control...

05:20.987 --> 05:22.955
I have to stop...

05:45.762 --> 05:47.059
I did it!

05:49.891 --> 05:51.143
I did it.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.023
I did it.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.122
And with the
elections just a few hours...

06:12.205 --> 06:13.502
How much longer
are you going to work?

06:13.582 --> 06:14.629
Almost got it.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.879
Some of us are
ready to go to bed.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.181
And some of us are working
on a very complicated

06:21.256 --> 06:24.430
self-winding Breguet
with a gong-spring.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.686
Well, I'm going to bed

06:26.761 --> 06:29.059
and unless you join me
in the next few minutes...

06:29.139 --> 06:31.938
You're going to be the
one who's self-winding tonight.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.485
And I'm done.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.280
Monroe,
Rosalee, it's me.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.570
What's wrong?

06:43.653 --> 06:45.246
Adalind's gone.
What?

06:45.322 --> 06:46.414
What do you mean,
"She's gone"?

06:46.489 --> 06:48.082
She left me
and she took Kelly.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.284
She didn't say anything?

06:49.367 --> 06:50.835
She left a note.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.413
She said that
she didn't have a choice

06:52.495 --> 06:54.088
and she had to do this
to protect her children.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.962
Oh, my God! Nick!

06:56.041 --> 06:58.089
Renard was pressuring her.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.923
I mean, she told me
she was afraid

07:00.003 --> 07:02.426
that he was going to use
Diana to get to her.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.973
You think
she's with Renard?

07:04.049 --> 07:05.972
I went to his place
and it was completely empty.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.806
Empty? What,
like, moved out?

07:07.844 --> 07:09.437
Yes.
Wait.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.355
When did she tell you
about Renard?

07:11.431 --> 07:12.751
A couple of nights ago.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.103
That's when she came
and dropped off Kelly with me.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.786
She said it was about work, but
when she came back to pick him up,

07:18.813 --> 07:20.493
I could tell she was upset
about something.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.363
You think
it was about Diana?

07:22.609 --> 07:24.828
Meisner told me Diana
was with Black Claw.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.245
How did they find her?

07:26.321 --> 07:27.948
I don't know.
Probably Renard.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.032
Diana's how they got
to Adalind.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.116
I'll tell you that.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.326
That's why she left.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.086
I'm not going to let him do this.
No! No! No!

07:33.161 --> 07:34.641
I can't let him take my son!
No! No! No!

07:34.663 --> 07:35.710
Nick, you gotta
think about this.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.291
I mean, do we even know
where they are right now?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.752
Anything you do
could jeopardize Kelly.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.217
We need to talk this out.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.099
They're here.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.313
Mommy!

08:00.897 --> 08:01.898
Oh...

08:05.568 --> 08:08.412
Do you want to meet your baby brother?
Come here.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.412
His name's Kelly.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.330
I want to hold him.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.412
Oh, I don't know, sweetie,
he's very young.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.747
Adalind.

08:18.415 --> 08:21.419
I know this was not
an easy decision for you.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.012
You held my daughter
hostage.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.839
We want this to work.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.641
This family is important
to all of us

08:28.717 --> 08:30.594
and having you all together

08:30.677 --> 08:32.929
ensures our place
in history, huh?

08:35.390 --> 08:36.767
He likes me!

08:39.936 --> 08:40.937
Hi!

08:42.480 --> 08:45.359
It's really not a good idea
to pick up a baby like that.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.112
And I think it's bedtime.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.197
Assuming there are
beds for us?

08:51.281 --> 08:53.375
Yeah. I'll show you.
Come on, honey.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.542
Okay.

08:58.496 --> 09:00.214
Nick, think about it.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.213
We're talking about a candidate
in the middle of an election,

09:02.292 --> 09:04.294
where the first candidate
was assassinated.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.675
So, he's got, like,
maximum protection.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.757
You're not going to
get close to Renard.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.559
And even if you do, if you
kill him, you're done.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.886
You'll never get
away with that.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.892
And you'll definitely
never see Kelly again.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.144
Which is exactly
what Black Claw would want.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.102
On top of which, Adalind's a
lawyer at a Wesen law firm,

09:20.185 --> 09:22.904
so your chances of getting Kelly
back legally aren't so hot either.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.059
We need to think
of another way around this.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.626
You need to tell Meisner
what happened.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.071
Hadrian's Wall probably
knows a lot more

09:28.151 --> 09:29.431
about what's going on
than we do.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.330
And if you're going to HW,
we're going with you.

09:36.868 --> 09:39.087
Black Claw still has people
watching us right now.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.419
After what happened with Wu,
they're getting more aggressive.

09:41.498 --> 09:44.001
We can't risk them
finding out about HW.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.124
Now, can you two get out of
here without being seen?

09:46.127 --> 09:48.408
I think so. If we go out the
back door and over the fence,

09:48.421 --> 09:50.139
it's basically woods down
to the street below.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.262
So meet us down there.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.139
I'll deal with
whoever follows me.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.219
Meet me in 15.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.431
I think we should wear
something black.

09:57.514 --> 09:58.686
Black?

10:34.509 --> 10:35.931
Stay here.

10:36.010 --> 10:37.353
He's mine.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.171
I lost him.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.057
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.356
You lose them?
Sort of.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.863
We got a Portland location on
the guys we took out in Nevada.

11:28.938 --> 11:29.985
Nevada?

11:30.064 --> 11:33.034
Where HW was keeping Diana
before Black Claw got to her.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.827
We traced their addresses
to Portland.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.463
They're concentrating
their forces here.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.205
We're all being watched.
Yeah, we know.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.407
Black Claw is
all over you guys.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.992
You got identities
on any of them?

11:41.075 --> 11:42.497
Most of them.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.545
I assume you lost
the two following you?

11:44.621 --> 11:45.873
For good.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.502
I'll update the database.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.176
Black Claw's moving a lot of
people around the Northwest.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.924
Lucien's been sighted
in Seattle.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.721
They've lost
a lot of people, too.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.470
They're replacing them just
as fast as we're taking them out.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.596
Glad you're all here.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.473
Take a look at this.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.435
Sort of a Black Claw
corporate structure.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.395
These are the top
Black Claw operatives

12:04.474 --> 12:05.851
that we know of,
alive or dead,

12:05.934 --> 12:08.312
listed based on their
position in the organization.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.734
The blank spots are
positions we know exist,

12:10.813 --> 12:12.736
but we don't yet know
who's filling them.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.855
As you can see,
Renard is near the top now.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.662
The red X's are the ones
we've killed.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.074
You said you thought something
was happening with Adalind.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.957
Diana was mentally contacting Adalind
and I somehow intercepted it.

12:25.036 --> 12:27.789
Like a twin telepathy
experience.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.249
Sort of got her
wires crossed.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.468
Did you go home?
Was Adalind there?

12:31.542 --> 12:32.964
No, Adalind left me.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.050
Took Kelly with her.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.256
Oh, crap.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.137
Do you have any idea
where Adalind and Kelly are?

12:38.216 --> 12:39.468
My guess is Renard.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.433
Your being here means
you haven't killed him yet.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.638
Not yet.

12:43.721 --> 12:44.973
How do we get Kelly back?

12:45.056 --> 12:46.399
Not by going after Renard.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.102
Black Claw's gone through a lot of
trouble to put him in that position.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.153
They've even created
a family for him.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.401
Makes him more electable.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.324
Well, electable or not, none of
us are voting for him tomorrow.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.073
Just for the record.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.790
I need to know where Renard is
and how well he's protected.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.286
We know where he is.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.210
Black Claw has him at a heavily
guarded house in the Northeast.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.789
You go after Renard there,
you will not survive.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.248
Don't forget,
they have Kelly.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.834
I'm can't stand by and do nothing.
They have my son.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.134
You have no choice!

13:14.210 --> 13:15.810
They will expect
you to be emotional

13:15.878 --> 13:17.346
and they will take
advantage of that.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.177
Well, that's easy
for you to say.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.933
He's not your kid.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.223
No, he's not.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.363
We have to help him.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.824
Well, not by doing
something stupid.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.955
Keep an eye on him.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.946
Okay.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.233
Where was it?
In the jacket on the chair.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.363
How long is this
going to take?

14:19.442 --> 14:20.864
It's gonna take as
long as it takes.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.365
Leave the door unlocked.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.915
I thought I heard something.
Is everything all right?

14:32.997 --> 14:34.214
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.884
I was a little cold.
Just turned up the heat.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.586
Come on.
Let's go back to bed.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.542
Sleep tight, sweetie.

15:10.493 --> 15:11.585
I love you.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.625
Good night.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.855
What are you doing?

15:38.938 --> 15:39.985
I didn't do that.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.190
Well, I didn't.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.610
Well, isn't that
sweet of her?

15:44.694 --> 15:46.196
She obviously
wants us together.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.202
Whether we want it or not.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.162
It's only natural.
We're her parents.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.915
She may be our daughter,
but we need to be careful.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.793
No one knows how powerful Diana is.
No one.

15:55.872 --> 15:56.998
She's still a little girl.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.503
Don't underestimate
little girls.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.630
I don't.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.803
I just suggest we find a
way to make this work.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.590
Look, we did have
some good times together.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.767
Is that what
you're looking for?

16:07.842 --> 16:09.219
More good times?

16:09.635 --> 16:11.979
I think you need to
get with the program.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.648
Look, I know this is
awkward and difficult.

16:21.731 --> 16:22.823
Thanks for catching up.

16:22.899 --> 16:26.449
I just need to ask. Did you
fall in love with Burkhardt?

16:26.569 --> 16:28.571
Now you ask? Well, we're
supposed to be a family.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.327
How do you suggest
we start doing that?

16:30.406 --> 16:31.703
Not in the bedroom.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.414
I'm not the same
Hexenbiest I was.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.791
I'll take what I can get.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.592
That's what you're going to get.
You want more?

16:42.877 --> 16:43.924
I think I'm good.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.403
Then get the hell out
of my bedroom.

16:50.092 --> 16:53.312
You must have fallen harder
for Burkhardt than I thought.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.447
Hey.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.367
Did Meisner tell you
to follow me?

17:06.442 --> 17:09.069
He did. But I would've
done it anyway.

17:09.444 --> 17:12.164
Look, I want you to know
that I'm with you on this.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.117
Lam going to help you
however I can.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.458
Adalind left me a note.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.372
What did she say?

17:19.872 --> 17:22.421
She said she had to do
what she did.

17:23.626 --> 17:24.923
You believe her?

17:26.587 --> 17:27.679
Yeah.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.892
And she said
she loved me.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.811
Yeah, well, I knew that.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.847
Wasn't hard to tell.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.933
I want my son back.

17:39.016 --> 17:42.111
Nick, if you want to go after
Renard right now, I'm with you.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.314
I got no problem takin'
him down. Let's do it.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.820
No, as long as he has Kelly,
it's too much of a risk.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.152
It's him.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.453
This should be interesting.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.530
Yeah.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.830
We need to talk.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.788
Where's my son?
He's safe.

17:55.866 --> 17:56.958
You're not.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.160
Neither are you.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.830
But we still need to talk.
Face to face.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.040
I suggest we meet
on neutral ground.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.130
My office. In one hour.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.677
I'll be there.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.175
He wants to meet in
his office in one hour.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.998
I could leave right now. Take
him out in the parking lot.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.099
You wouldn't be involved.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.395
No.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.563
Thanks.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.107
I want to hear
what he has to say.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.434
So what do you
want me to do?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.269
Stay here.
And I mean it.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.195
Stay here.
Okay.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.099
Hey!

19:08.230 --> 19:09.402
Come on!

19:20.826 --> 19:22.328
Oh, my God!
What happened?

19:22.411 --> 19:23.412
Do you know this guy?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.136
No.
I've never seen him before.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.046
I gotta call this in.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.936
This is Detective Griffin
reporting a B and E.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.738
Five eighteen,
Southwest Lambert.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.782
Suspect's been detained.

19:55.820 --> 19:56.946
You okay?

19:57.947 --> 20:00.951
No, no. I just... I can't believe
that someone just broke...

20:01.033 --> 20:03.411
Broke into my house.
I'm so glad you were here.

20:03.494 --> 20:04.837
Thank God.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.382
You wanted to talk?
Talk.

20:21.429 --> 20:22.521
I'm not your enemy.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.769
You have Adalind
and my son.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.522
Doesn't exactly
make you my friend.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.568
Believe it or not,
I know how you feel.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.646
Now, a couple of years ago,
I gave my daughter away

20:30.730 --> 20:32.983
to your mother because I
trusted her and I trusted you.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.317
You were asked.
I was asked,

20:34.400 --> 20:35.600
but I wasn't given
much choice.

20:35.651 --> 20:36.777
I wasn't given any.

20:37.862 --> 20:41.912
Nick, sometimes the only way to protect
the ones you love is to let them go.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.151
And sometimes the only way
to protect the ones you love

20:44.201 --> 20:45.578
is to kill the people
who threaten them.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.662
What do you think?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.874
You were going to settle down with
Adalind and have a normal life?

20:48.956 --> 20:50.253
A Grimm and a Hexenbiest.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.879
I know what you're doing.
Do you?

20:51.959 --> 20:53.586
You're working
for Black Claw.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.262
They killed Dixon
so you could take his place.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.385
They set you up
to be a hero.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.012
What is it you think
I don't know?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.513
That you are one of us.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.270
Like it or not,
you're a Grimm,

21:03.345 --> 21:05.347
and you understand
how things really work.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.186
The Kehrseite have
had the world

21:07.266 --> 21:08.939
for too long
and they've ruined it.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.146
Our world will be more
violent, more primitive,

21:11.228 --> 21:13.856
but that is the only way
to true progress.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.950
You've really bought
into this.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.619
It's time for Wesen to
come out of the shadows,

21:18.694 --> 21:20.196
Nick, and they're going to.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.622
Believe me.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.495
With or without me...

21:24.116 --> 21:25.868
With or without you.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.750
You were the first Grimm
to fight alongside Wesen.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.251
They haven't forgotten that.

21:30.331 --> 21:33.130
They want Grimms with them,
not against them.

21:33.626 --> 21:37.130
Black Claw will kill any Wesen
who doesn't agree with them.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.465
They're murderers.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.720
We all have blood
on our hands, Nick.

21:40.800 --> 21:45.021
This is a revolution and
revolutions are forged in blood.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.230
What about all the people
who aren't Wesen?

21:47.556 --> 21:49.058
That depends on us.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.485
Work with me.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.813
Together we can keep
the bloodshed to a minimum.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.985
I want my son back.

21:57.608 --> 22:01.158
If you join us, you can
have anything you want.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.080
Just think about that.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.495
Most of the world
doesn't even know we exist.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.248
How can they fight an enemy
that they don't believe in?

22:10.830 --> 22:13.709
Nick, this is not a fight
that you're going to win.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.924
I don't think there are going
to be any winners in this one.

22:27.471 --> 22:28.768
Why do you have to go?

22:30.474 --> 22:32.852
Something doesn't feel right
about this guy.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.604
What do you mean?

22:34.687 --> 22:37.657
That guy breaks into your house,
but doesn't take anything?

22:37.731 --> 22:39.404
Well, maybe
he heard you coming.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.030
Or maybe he might've
been here for me.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.362
YOU, Why?

22:42.444 --> 22:43.741
Cops make enemies.

22:43.821 --> 22:46.165
And I have to find out
if he's one of mine.

22:47.116 --> 22:50.871
An officer will be outside your
door for the rest of the night.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.417
Lock your door.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.622
Okay.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.593
Thank you.

22:58.544 --> 23:00.137
I'll call you
as soon as I can.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.389
Hank, I found his car
just down the street.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.563
Show me.

23:13.684 --> 23:16.813
Bad smell comin' from inside
so I figured I had good cause.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.615
I found some paraphernalia in the
glove box, along with some pills,

23:19.690 --> 23:22.239
Valium I think,
some ecstasy, amphetamines,

23:22.318 --> 23:23.740
basically a drug store.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.698
And there's a laptop
under that passenger seat.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.246
Registration?

23:30.326 --> 23:31.326
None that I could find.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.086
I ran the plates but they
didn't belong to this car.

23:33.162 --> 23:35.665
Plates were reported stolen from
Astoria couple of weeks ago.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.920
You check the trunk?
Yeah.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.626
Seventeen more sets
of stolen plates,

23:38.709 --> 23:41.212
a 12-gauge pump shotgun,
and a dead cat.

23:41.378 --> 23:43.597
Which explains
the bad smell.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.394
Well, the cat didn't die
in vain.

23:49.845 --> 23:52.268
Impound the car.
Dust it.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.816
I'm taking the computer.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.146
Right.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.859
How'd it go?

23:59.980 --> 24:01.072
He's still alive?

24:01.148 --> 24:02.320
For now.

24:02.399 --> 24:03.616
Well, what did he say?

24:04.652 --> 24:06.199
He tried to recruit me.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.450
No way.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.781
Seriously?

24:08.864 --> 24:10.958
They want Grimms
on their side.

24:11.033 --> 24:13.206
Yeah, that makes sense.
They wanna keep their heads.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.877
Look, Nick, I wish there
was something I could do.

24:20.209 --> 24:21.256
What?

24:24.463 --> 24:26.181
There's something
I need to show you.

24:26.465 --> 24:27.717
Okay...

24:28.342 --> 24:32.313
When Monroe and I went to
Germany with the keys...

24:32.763 --> 24:34.857
You found something...

24:36.433 --> 24:37.810
Stay here.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.008
Ran your perp's ID but no
matches at Motor Vehicles.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.881
ID's a fake and
a damn good one.

25:02.960 --> 25:05.054
It's harder to fake
fingerprints.

25:05.129 --> 25:08.508
So, meet Anthony "Tony"
Talamonti, 34, lot of drug issues

25:08.590 --> 25:10.433
and an arrest
three years ago involving

25:10.509 --> 25:12.352
some hacker collective
called Robotomy.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.720
"Robotomy"?

25:13.762 --> 25:15.355
Yeah, like lobotomy
for robots, I guess.

25:15.431 --> 25:16.899
So why does
a drug-addicted hacker

25:16.974 --> 25:19.193
break into an apartment
and not steal anything?

25:19.268 --> 25:20.360
Maybe you caught him
on the way in.

25:20.436 --> 25:23.189
No, no, he was on his way out.
He was at the door, leaving.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.615
Then you got me.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.810
I still can't make sense
of the dead cat in his trunk.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.738
Unless it was a pet he just
couldn't say goodbye to.

25:29.820 --> 25:30.912
Any luck with the computer?

25:30.988 --> 25:32.035
No, it has a password.

25:32.114 --> 25:33.866
I'm gonna have Tech
get into it.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.667
Anything else?
No, not for now.

25:35.743 --> 25:36.960
Thanks.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.634
What is it?

25:52.551 --> 25:54.394
It looks really old.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.723
It's not Pandora's box,
is it?

25:57.556 --> 25:59.650
No, I'm not really sure.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.102
But we've already
opened it.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.108
With the keys?
Yeah.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.819
So this really is
what they buried?

26:06.148 --> 26:07.320
It is.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.830
It's not just a stick.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.000
Um, it looks like
just a stick.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.793
Does it do anything?

26:17.868 --> 26:20.166
I think it saved
Monroe's life.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.297
What? How?

26:22.790 --> 26:24.508
He was bitten on his arm.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.756
It was infected.
He had blood poisoning.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.054
He started passing out

26:29.797 --> 26:31.174
and this was in my hand.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.384
And I grabbed him
and he just...

26:35.677 --> 26:38.521
The wound healed.
It completely disappeared.

26:39.181 --> 26:41.183
Were you sure that this
piece of wood did that?

26:41.266 --> 26:43.268
No, we're not sure
of anything.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.275
But one of the words
on this cloth

26:45.354 --> 26:47.698
translates to "miracle."

26:48.315 --> 26:50.943
Oh, wow. Miracle, okay.

26:55.239 --> 26:56.957
Looks like it broke off
of something.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.034
Yeah, but off of what?

27:00.119 --> 27:02.838
Some of the other words
translate to dangerous,

27:02.913 --> 27:04.711
threatening, hazardous
or perilous.

27:04.915 --> 27:07.213
Well, what's the dangerous,
hazardous, perilous part?

27:07.709 --> 27:08.961
We're not sure.

27:09.044 --> 27:12.093
Okay, if it has the power to
heal, what else can it do?

27:12.339 --> 27:14.433
And where does
its power come from?

27:14.508 --> 27:16.931
Well, I think that depends
on what you believe in.

27:17.719 --> 27:20.643
Well, the Crusaders who buried
this hundreds of years ago

27:20.722 --> 27:23.271
had to believe
it came from God, right?

27:23.350 --> 27:25.352
I mean that's what
the Crusades were about.

27:25.435 --> 27:27.437
So? Does it prove God exists?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.945
Damn! That's kind of big.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.490
Let me show you
where I put it.

27:35.863 --> 27:39.538
We cannot let Black Claw
find this, ever.

27:40.075 --> 27:43.079
And I don't want HW
knowing about it either.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.583
Well, who does know
about it?

27:47.791 --> 27:50.590
Hank, Wu, Monroe, Rosalee

27:50.669 --> 27:51.795
and now you.

27:52.629 --> 27:53.926
What about Adalind?

27:54.506 --> 27:55.723
I didn't tell her.

27:56.633 --> 27:57.759
Yeah.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.016
It's a good idea
considering...

28:02.681 --> 28:03.978
You're a Grimm.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.110
If anything happens to me,

28:08.437 --> 28:11.907
you and only you
know where this is.

28:19.281 --> 28:21.625
Portlanders are turning out
in record numbers

28:21.700 --> 28:23.498
for today's mayoral election

28:23.577 --> 28:26.956
and the polls indicate this race
is still too close to call.

28:27.164 --> 28:28.586
How'd it go?

28:29.041 --> 28:30.839
Renard called Nick
last night.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.044
He went to go see him.

28:32.127 --> 28:34.596
Renard tried to convince him
to join Black Claw.

28:34.671 --> 28:35.718
Didn't have much luck.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.549
How's Burkhardt
handling all this?

28:37.633 --> 28:39.306
As good as he can.

28:55.525 --> 28:56.993
You're angry.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.330
Yeah.

29:00.656 --> 29:01.873
Just a little.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.121
Don't make mistakes.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.326
Working on it.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.337
Does he blame Adalind?

29:08.413 --> 29:11.041
No, he thinks
she didn't have a choice.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.755
What do you think?

29:12.834 --> 29:14.381
No. What do you think?

29:16.255 --> 29:19.179
I think you have more anger
than you know what to do with.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.010
Hey! You didn't answer
my question.

29:24.554 --> 29:28.184
I think there is a choice even
when there appears to be none.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.814
But it's the reaction
that determines

29:29.893 --> 29:32.112
whether the choice
is good or bad.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.814
Not the person
who makes it.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.695
And what would
Juliette think?

29:37.526 --> 29:38.903
I don't go there.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.031
Too dangerous.

29:45.867 --> 29:46.868
You're here early.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.420
Been here all night.

29:48.495 --> 29:50.338
I thought you had a date.
I did.

29:50.414 --> 29:53.884
Had a little B and E action.
Got the guy. He's Wesen.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.381
Not going to
even guess what.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.462
I was waiting to interrogate
him till you got here.

29:57.546 --> 29:58.638
On a B and E?

29:58.714 --> 30:00.967
Yeah, a B and E where he was
leaving without taking.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.552
I caught him leaving
empty-handed.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.313
I ID'd the guy.
He's Tony Talamonti.

30:06.388 --> 30:07.731
So, how'd Tony come in?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.353
Windows were closed
and locked.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.980
He had to come through
the front door.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.402
Did Zuri leave
the door unlocked?

30:12.477 --> 30:14.821
She left it unlocked for me
when I came over, earlier.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.614
Could've been a mistake.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.818
But I think the guy
was there for me.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.277
I'm thinking
he's Black Claw.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.158
Sounds like we both
had a rough night.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.409
What'd I miss?

30:23.488 --> 30:25.991
Adalind left me.
Took Kelly with her.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.667
What?
And she left me a note.

30:27.743 --> 30:28.915
Said she didn't
have a choice.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.088
Which I'm pretty sure
means they have Diana.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.164
Do you know
where she is?

30:32.247 --> 30:33.339
With Renard.

30:33.415 --> 30:35.417
Oh. This just keeps
getting better.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.860
Yeah, we had a pretty interesting
talk at 3:00 this morning.

30:37.919 --> 30:38.919
And he's still alive?

30:38.962 --> 30:41.681
He has my son.
Kind of complicates things.

30:41.757 --> 30:44.806
I don't have a son. Do you
want me to talk to him?

30:44.885 --> 30:46.011
Maybe later.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.687
Right now,
we have to figure out

30:47.763 --> 30:49.265
if your guy's connected
to Black Claw.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.522
How do we do that? These guys
aren't big on admitting stuff.

30:52.601 --> 30:54.148
I'll push him,
see if he Woges.

30:54.227 --> 30:55.900
But if he is Black Claw,
won't he know you're a Grimm?

30:55.979 --> 30:58.653
Yeah. So if he Woges,
he's not Black Claw.

30:58.732 --> 30:59.858
If he doesn't,
he knows I'm a Grimm,

30:59.941 --> 31:01.141
and he's trying
to fake us out.

31:01.151 --> 31:02.528
So we fake out
the fake out.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.828
Exactly.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.448
Hey! Nice ID, Tony.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.078
How much it cost you?

31:09.284 --> 31:11.036
Yeah, we got you on
breaking and entering,

31:11.119 --> 31:13.793
assaulting an officer,
drugs in the car.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.715
Be a lot easier
if you open up a little.

31:15.791 --> 31:18.214
Be a lot easier
if you just let me go.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.045
What happened
to your hand?

31:20.504 --> 31:21.551
You worried about me?

31:21.630 --> 31:22.927
We're trying to work
with you, Tony.

31:23.006 --> 31:24.724
Give you a chance
to drop a few charges.

31:25.133 --> 31:27.807
I can tell you guys are
really concerned for my well-being.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.014
Why'd you pick that house?

31:30.097 --> 31:31.599
What house?
What were you after?

31:31.681 --> 31:32.898
What were you after?

31:36.478 --> 31:38.572
You Woged in front
of my partner.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.741
You wanna do it again?
"Woged"?

31:40.816 --> 31:41.988
Not sure I know
what you mean.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.740
You're Wesen.
What's that?

31:43.819 --> 31:45.412
You really want me
to explain it to you?

31:45.487 --> 31:47.489
Yeah, why don't you try?

31:57.207 --> 31:58.504
Now what?

32:05.006 --> 32:06.007
Had enough?

32:06.091 --> 32:07.468
Nothing?
No.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.019
He definitely knows who I am.
And who you are.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.391
All right. So how do you
want to handle this?

32:10.470 --> 32:11.596
You saw him Woge?

32:11.680 --> 32:14.934
Yeah, gotta say, whatever
he is, is bad-ass nasty.

32:15.142 --> 32:16.439
Until we figure out
what he is,

32:16.518 --> 32:17.815
I don't think we should
do anything else.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.859
Pick him out in the books?
Let's hope he's in one of 'em.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.190
Let's go.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.449
Wu...
Morning.

32:23.525 --> 32:24.525
How you feeling?

32:24.568 --> 32:26.241
Gotta say, pretty good.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.494
Dreams?

32:29.573 --> 32:32.372
Some, but I think
I'm getting a handle on it.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.169
One thing I know,
I need to stay busy.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.444
Being alone in my apartment
may not be all that healthy.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.419
Got something for me?
We do.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.717
We want to keep you busy.
Mmm-hmm.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.635
Got this off
a B and E last night.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.088
Love to know what's on it.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.423
Password protected.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.973
Not for long.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.604
No hair?

32:55.348 --> 32:56.440
More buggy.

32:56.516 --> 32:59.816
Spinnetod buggy or Mellifer
or Jinnamuru Xunte buggy?

32:59.895 --> 33:03.490
No, no, bigger, with kind
of a shield on its face.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.988
Well, the shields, you've got
your Musasat Alsh-Shabab.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.661
And there's always the Kackenkopf.
I hate them.

33:08.737 --> 33:10.535
I got one right here.

33:11.907 --> 33:13.750
Oh, yeah.
That's our Tony.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.669
Tony? His name's Tony,
the guy you arrested?

33:16.745 --> 33:18.588
And he's a Kackenkopf?
Yeah.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.917
Well, he had a fake ID, but his
real name is Anthony Talamonti.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.002
Oh, my God, it's Tony.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.678
Seattle Tony?
You know this guy?

33:25.754 --> 33:26.801
Yeah, she does.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.473
It's the same guy that was
here in the spice shop

33:28.548 --> 33:30.948
when we were in Germany when
Adalind got her Hexenbiest back.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.101
What did he do?

33:32.177 --> 33:35.101
Well, not much after Adalind broke
all five fingers in his left hand.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.689
We think he's working
for Black Claw.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.397
And he was here in the shop
and he's following you now?

33:43.480 --> 33:45.983
This is... Yeah, this is
getting a little scary.

33:46.066 --> 33:47.443
I want to see this guy.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.370
Five minutes, man, just give
me five minutes with this guy.

33:50.445 --> 33:51.992
It's Wu.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.072
Wu, what do you got?

33:53.114 --> 33:54.912
Since Hank gave me the laptop,
I would normally call him,

33:54.991 --> 33:57.665
but because of what I found on
the laptop, I'm calling you.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.163
What'd you find?

33:59.246 --> 34:00.366
You have
your cell phone?

34:00.372 --> 34:01.498
Um, yeah.

34:02.582 --> 34:03.959
Well, apparently,
so did he.

34:04.584 --> 34:07.804
Everything on your cell phone
is now on this guy's computer.

34:07.879 --> 34:09.222
Every email you've made,

34:09.297 --> 34:11.264
every text you've sent,
all of your contacts.

34:11.341 --> 34:13.217
I wouldn't be using
that phone if I were you.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.678
I knew something was wrong.

34:14.761 --> 34:16.263
That's why the phone
was in my left pocket.

34:16.346 --> 34:18.098
I normally put it
in my right.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.650
He put the phone back
in the wrong pocket.

34:20.976 --> 34:21.976
Thanks, Wu.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.527
I did kinda nail it,
didn't I?

34:23.603 --> 34:25.321
You did. Thanks.

34:25.397 --> 34:26.614
Hang on to the laptop.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.237
I want to take it
over to HW.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.533
You got it.

34:30.193 --> 34:33.288
Well, we still don't know how Tony
got into Zuri's in the first place.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.036
There was no signs
of forced entry.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.835
Do you think Zuri
unlocked the door for him?

34:39.536 --> 34:41.616
I thought I heard something.
Is everything all right?

34:41.621 --> 34:42.918
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.342
I was a little cold.
Just turned up the heat.

34:47.627 --> 34:48.799
She could have.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.929
Could this be the reason that she
got involved with you again?

34:53.007 --> 34:54.931
There are some things
that aren't adding up.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.637
I don't know, Hank. Maybe
it was just an accident.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.000
No, I don't believe
in accidents.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.853
If she's Black Claw, she's
not going to admit it.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.859
Not unless we make her.

35:06.855 --> 35:09.108
Exit polls
indicate that Sean Renard

35:09.190 --> 35:11.443
has strong support
across the city.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.995
But Steven Gallagher
is showing strong support

35:14.070 --> 35:16.072
in the North
and Northeast.

35:16.156 --> 35:20.127
The polls close in just about 45
minutes and we will be bringing you...

35:20.201 --> 35:21.953
What are you
going to win, Daddy?

35:22.287 --> 35:25.712
Well, if I get enough votes,
then I become the Mayor.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.963
Is a Mayor fun?

35:29.711 --> 35:31.088
I hope so.

35:32.088 --> 35:34.261
Big day.
Guess we're all excited.

35:34.341 --> 35:35.388
How much longer?

35:35.467 --> 35:36.935
We should know in
less than an hour.

35:37.010 --> 35:38.478
You look beautiful,
Adalind.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.396
Well, we all do what
we can for the cause.

35:41.598 --> 35:43.475
Can I get you
a cup of coffee?

35:43.558 --> 35:45.560
Sure.
Please.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.949
I want you to know that
we all worked very hard

35:55.028 --> 35:56.871
to bring Diana
back to you.

35:57.947 --> 35:59.494
I didn't think
I'd ever see her again.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.460
Adalind, uh...

36:03.828 --> 36:06.331
I confess I don't know
everything about you,

36:06.414 --> 36:09.418
but I do know about your
relationship with the Grimm.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.424
I know he's the father
of your son.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.676
He was good to me.
And he didn't have to be.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.849
Don't ask me
to betray him.

36:16.091 --> 36:18.514
He will try to stop us,
if he can.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.811
Whatever happens to him, you
cannot take it personally.

36:22.889 --> 36:24.015
Now, where is he?

36:24.099 --> 36:25.726
I'm not going
to tell you that.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.773
We Will find him.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.820
But I won't have helped.

36:40.490 --> 36:41.707
Nick!

36:41.783 --> 36:42.830
What are you doing here?

36:42.909 --> 36:44.001
Can I come in?

36:44.077 --> 36:45.124
Uh, sure.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.128
Did something happen to Hank?
No, Hank's fine.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.800
He's getting a safe house
ready for you.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.297
A safe house? What?

36:52.669 --> 36:55.718
What's wrong?
Am I in some kind of danger?

36:55.797 --> 36:57.424
Have you ever heard
of Black Claw?

36:58.049 --> 36:59.722
No, what is it?

36:59.801 --> 37:01.974
It's a very
dangerous organization.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.556
Now the guy who broke into your
house last night was one of them.

37:04.639 --> 37:05.765
He was going after Hank.

37:05.849 --> 37:06.896
Oh, my God!

37:06.975 --> 37:08.568
We're afraid now they
know about you and Hank,

37:08.643 --> 37:10.236
that you're
the next target.

37:10.770 --> 37:13.774
So, pack whatever you can,
enough for a week.

37:13.857 --> 37:15.655
What? I can’t just leave!

37:16.151 --> 37:17.994
You're not safe here.

37:18.695 --> 37:20.572
Hank will be by in
a half hour to pick you up.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.407
I'll be right outside
in my car until then.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.288
Don't worry, everything
is going to be okay.

37:24.367 --> 37:25.869
Just, do not
use your phone.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.454
We can't assume
that those are safe.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.255
But I didn't do anything.

37:29.330 --> 37:32.174
Unfortunately,
knowing Hank is enough.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.009
So, lock the door behind me.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.759
Do not open it again
unless it's me or Hank.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.046
Yeah?
We've got a problem.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.152
Burkhardt is here. He's
taking me to a safe house.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.198
Why?
Because of Hank.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.447
They figured out that
Tony was here for him.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.073
Do they suspect you?
No.

38:00.153 --> 38:01.655
Why would they be
taking me to a safe house?

38:01.738 --> 38:03.456
Now I'm supposed to pack
for a week.

38:03.531 --> 38:04.657
What do you want me to do?

38:04.741 --> 38:05.867
Cooperate.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.873
Pack for a week and go.

38:08.453 --> 38:09.579
That's enough for now.

38:10.163 --> 38:12.291
So, I guess we didn't meet
by accident.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.836
I really felt
something for you, Zuri.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.593
Hank...
You unlocked the door.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.057
No, I didn't. I...
Stop.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.310
You unlocked the door,
and you gave Tony my phone.

38:24.385 --> 38:26.228
You don't understand.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.807
They made me do it.
Hank, I love you,

38:28.890 --> 38:31.985
but they threatened me,
and my brother.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.983
I just did
what I had to do.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.735
I love you, Hank.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.074
I love you.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.368
I'm so sorry.

38:51.412 --> 38:53.210
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

39:02.924 --> 39:05.018
Where am I?
Doesn't matter where you are.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.266
What matters is
what comes next.

39:07.345 --> 39:12.351
Two roads diverged in a yellow
wood and you cannot travel both.

39:13.601 --> 39:14.978
So which is it gonna be?

39:17.272 --> 39:18.694
Occultatum Libera.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.193
Guess she chose
the rough road.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.037
Okay, I'm going to
get a cup of coffee.

39:25.113 --> 39:26.740
She's all yours.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.295
So, you don't
want to talk.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.177
Then I guess you won't
be needing your mouth.

39:50.972 --> 39:53.600
It doesn't get
much better from here.

39:55.310 --> 39:59.315
With 38% of the votes counted,
Channel 8 has declared

39:59.397 --> 40:01.775
Sean Renard
the new Mayor of Portland

40:01.858 --> 40:04.202
in what appears
to be a landslide.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.371
Let's go live now
to the Benson Hotel.

40:06.654 --> 40:09.157
I'm told that Police Captain,
and now Mayor-elect

40:09.240 --> 40:11.368
Sean Renard is
on his way down,

40:11.451 --> 40:13.670
and that he will be
making a victory speech.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.418
In fact, here he comes now.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.586
Thank you!

40:22.295 --> 40:23.512
Thank you very much.

40:25.632 --> 40:27.384
Thank you, everyone!

40:28.259 --> 40:29.602
Thank you!

40:31.846 --> 40:33.689
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.898
Now, first and foremost
I would like to congratulate

40:36.976 --> 40:40.196
my opponent, Steven Gallagher,
on a well-fought campaign.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.403
No, no. Come on.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.533
I just got off
the phone with Steven,

40:44.609 --> 40:47.453
and he conceded
and congratulated us.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.281
That's right.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.703
I want to thank you all.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.164
All of my supporters and
to the people of Portland,

40:57.246 --> 40:59.795
those who voted for me
and those who did not.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.797
It is time for us to
overcome our differences

41:01.876 --> 41:03.719
and to work together
to make Portland

41:03.795 --> 41:06.389
an even greater city
than it already is!

41:13.096 --> 41:16.726
Now, there are a lot of people
that I need to thank tonight,

41:16.808 --> 41:20.483
but I would like to begin
with the love of my life

41:20.561 --> 41:22.984
and the mother of
my children, Ada/ind.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.158
Please, come up
and join me.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.076
Come on, darling. Come on.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.244
Get up there.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.321
Please.

41:31.572 --> 41:32.824
Come here, you.

41:44.669 --> 41:45.716
Thank you!

41:55.054 --> 41:56.055
Yes?

41:58.099 --> 42:00.147
Do you know
where they took her?

42:01.102 --> 42:02.399
As long as we know
where she is,

42:02.478 --> 42:04.230
we know where they are.

42:04.731 --> 42:06.449
Wait for my call.

42:12.280 --> 42:13.327
Thank you.

42:14.282 --> 42:15.534
You're dead.
