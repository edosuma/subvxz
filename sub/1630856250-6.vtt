00:06.966 --> 00:08.342
- Previously on <i>Reacher...</i>
- I'm Marlo Burns,

00:08.342 --> 00:09.844
New Age director of operations.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.973
She's got a kid.

00:13.973 --> 00:15.433
You might want
to come and see this.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.560
Who the hell
goes on the lam and leaves

00:17.560 --> 00:18.853
their cash stash behind?

00:18.853 --> 00:20.563
Apparently Marlo Burns.

00:20.563 --> 00:23.524
I'm paying a premium
for a seamless transaction

00:23.524 --> 00:24.900
and so far this has been
anything but.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.986
The Little Wing chips
will be ready to install

00:26.986 --> 00:28.779
in the missiles
by the time you get here,

00:28.779 --> 00:31.490
<i>and Mr. Swan's associates
will be taken care of.</i>

00:31.490 --> 00:32.575
So what happened out there?

00:32.575 --> 00:33.784
Well, a New Age truck

00:33.784 --> 00:36.120
with all 650 missiles in it
was hijacked.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.538
I hope that's the "worse news."

00:37.538 --> 00:38.581
<i>You wish.</i>

00:38.581 --> 00:40.166
Tony Swan's alive.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.792
You call me dirty
one more time,

00:41.792 --> 00:43.878
I will give you that beating
that I owe you.

00:43.878 --> 00:46.380
I'll take that fight
any time you want.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.298
Get down!

00:49.383 --> 00:50.426
Talk. Now.

00:50.426 --> 00:51.427
I don't know any Langston.

00:51.427 --> 00:52.428
Then who hired you?

00:52.428 --> 00:53.763
Some guy called Swan.

00:53.763 --> 00:54.847
<i>If Swan's really</i>

00:54.847 --> 00:55.848
in that building,
I'm gonna do

00:55.848 --> 00:57.057
the same thing
I did to that guy.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.684
Wrap my hand around his neck

00:58.684 --> 01:00.227
and squeeze
the truth out of him.

01:13.032 --> 01:15.993
What do you think
they used-- HMX?

01:15.993 --> 01:17.828
Blast that big?

01:17.828 --> 01:19.246
Could be CL-20.

01:19.246 --> 01:22.208
Yeah, but HMX is a more
readily available explosive.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.960
True, but CL-20's stronger.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.171
Who cares what they used?

01:27.171 --> 01:29.089
I'm more interested
in who used it.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.135
Am I really the only one here
that's gonna say it?

01:34.386 --> 01:36.430
What? The guy was hired by Swan.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.349
He was going to get paid
by Swan.

01:38.349 --> 01:42.144
He got his ass blown halfway
across the street by Swan.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.854
What, we can't say
this guy's name now?

01:43.854 --> 01:45.356
What is he, Beetlejuice?

01:45.356 --> 01:47.817
I'm not gonna assume
Swan's dirty.

01:47.817 --> 01:49.944
In an investigation,
assumptions kill.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.695
So do military-grade
munitions.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.072
Hey there, Russo.

01:54.323 --> 01:58.494
Bomb squad found remnants
of a tripwire-rigged IED.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.871
Whoever did this is a pro
or the people we're after

02:00.871 --> 02:02.456
are trained
in this sort of thing.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.375
Military training, maybe?

02:04.375 --> 02:07.503
Maybe. We don't
definitively know.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.129
Sure.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.382
Well, what we do know is their
plan was to have you all killed

02:11.382 --> 02:13.425
in the boneyard and then
take out the assassins here.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.760
No loose ends.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.637
- Bodies?
- Just the sniper's.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.264
Your pal Swan wasn't there.

02:18.264 --> 02:19.890
Shocking.

02:22.518 --> 02:23.811
Yeah.

02:26.355 --> 02:27.857
Where?

02:27.857 --> 02:30.442
Okay, send me the address.

02:30.442 --> 02:32.987
Marlo Burns' car was found
north of Manhattan,

02:32.987 --> 02:35.155
near Cortland.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.074
We'll head up now. You coming?

02:37.074 --> 02:38.450
No.

02:38.450 --> 02:41.120
There's someone
I need to talk to.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.832
Try not to leave any
dead bodies behind this time.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.418
He's like that angry,
pissed off detective

02:47.418 --> 02:48.794
from that movie.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.462
Which one?

02:50.462 --> 02:51.589
All of them.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.257
All right.

02:53.257 --> 02:56.510
Let's go find the woman
that sent us to get killed.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.789
Nothing in here, boss.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.751
Yeah, it looks like she dumped
this thing and took off.

03:28.751 --> 03:30.336
Maybe.

03:30.336 --> 03:33.589
But if I were her, I'd hit
the head and grab a snack first.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.802
She got her kid
a drink and a dog

03:38.802 --> 03:40.220
and bought
a burner phone with cash,

03:40.220 --> 03:41.889
let me keep the change.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.892
She was in a rush.
Didn't have time for change.

03:44.892 --> 03:48.395
If you want to see better,
you can scooch in.

03:49.647 --> 03:52.107
She's not the "scooch in" type.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.901
Can you zoom in a little?

03:53.901 --> 03:55.277
I can pop it in, but

03:55.277 --> 03:56.779
a lot of the details
may be lost.

03:56.779 --> 03:58.280
Details matter.

04:00.658 --> 04:02.368
Kid's playing a Nintendo Switch.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.536
If we knew her gamertag,
we could track

04:04.536 --> 04:06.538
the IP address to her device
and that'll lead us

04:06.538 --> 04:07.539
to their location.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.124
But how do we find her gamertag?

04:09.124 --> 04:11.418
We go back to Marlo's house.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.838
It might be on another device
there, like a smart TV.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.548
I ever tell you
you're smart, Neagley?

04:16.548 --> 04:18.592
Not nearly enough.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.808
Switch from the suit.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.476
Need new gear.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.980
Add it to the national debt?

04:32.439 --> 04:35.693
And like the national debt,
it never has to be repaid.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.405
I'll take these.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.368
And a Clark Bar.

04:52.501 --> 04:55.212
Hello, officer.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.548
This is my vehicle.
Is there a problem?

04:57.548 --> 05:00.759
Huh, nothing that'll get you
death row, just the, uh,

05:00.759 --> 05:03.303
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
doesn't permit objects

05:03.303 --> 05:04.638
to hang in the rearview.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.682
Yeah, the-the rental car company
put that there, and, uh,

05:06.682 --> 05:08.559
being from the other side
of the Atlantic, I'm not

05:08.559 --> 05:10.227
so familiar with
your traffic regulations.

05:12.021 --> 05:15.441
But I will remove it
in all due haste.

05:17.568 --> 05:18.652
There you go.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.779
So, uh,

05:20.779 --> 05:24.658
maybe you can find the grace
to give me a pass on the ticket?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.702
Just give you a warning.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.787
I cannot thank you enough
for your...

05:30.122 --> 05:31.832
Forgive me, I thought
you said no ticket.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.293
Official warnings still
need to be written up, sir.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.586
If I could have your license,

05:35.586 --> 05:37.212
it'll take me maybe
two minutes to run it

05:37.212 --> 05:38.380
and then you're on your way.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.133
Of course.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.809
All right. I'll be right back
with this, Doctor.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.732
Dispatch, this is Hicks, 55R41.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.692
Please run an interstate check

05:58.692 --> 06:00.944
on Colorado driver's license

06:00.944 --> 06:05.240
C17-057-7105

06:05.240 --> 06:08.160
for a Manuel Elzogby.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.622
Copy that, 55R41, stand by.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.123
Okay, Doc, we'll have you
out of here shortly.

06:27.513 --> 06:30.641
<i>55R41, we have an interstate
alert on Dr. Elzogby.</i>

06:30.641 --> 06:33.936
<i>He was a victim of
a homicide robbery in Colorado.</i>

06:33.936 --> 06:36.688
<i>Proceed with caution.
Backup is on its way.</i>

06:37.689 --> 06:40.025
<i>Atomic Fall?</i>

06:40.025 --> 06:43.070
<i>Juggle the Jungle. Visited.</i>

06:43.070 --> 06:45.572
Can't believe people
actually play these things.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.659
I did a job
for a game designer last year--

06:48.659 --> 06:50.369
billion dollar company.

06:50.369 --> 06:53.205
- You got to be shittin' me.
- Well, you should try one.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.748
You'd like
a first-person shooter.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.126
I am a first-person shooter.

06:57.126 --> 07:00.379
Yo, I'm making some frozen pizza
if anyone wants it.

07:00.379 --> 07:03.966
Jane's tag is PlainJane777.

07:03.966 --> 07:06.009
She does a lot of
cross-platform games.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.138
I'll log into my own account and
play until she gets back online.

07:09.138 --> 07:10.764
Gonna need some gamer fuel.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.016
Uh, OD, see what Marlo
has in the kitchen

07:13.016 --> 07:14.518
in the way of breakfast cereal.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.103
Puffs, Pops or Pebbles,

07:16.103 --> 07:17.229
in that order of preference.

07:17.229 --> 07:18.856
Looks like this might
take a while.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.108
Got to wait for Jane
to get her game on.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.401
Well, until then,

07:22.401 --> 07:25.654
I'm gonna catch some shut-eye.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.524
We have been attacked by bikers,

08:02.524 --> 08:06.069
shot at by hit men,
and almost blown up.

08:06.069 --> 08:09.364
I mean, to put it mildly,

08:09.364 --> 08:11.491
I've got some pent-up tension.

08:17.206 --> 08:19.833
I know you've got this rule,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.419
"sleep when you can," but...

08:22.419 --> 08:25.797
It's not that firm of a rule.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.674
Hm.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.628
Guy.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.672
It's a little late for
a drop-in. Is everything okay?

09:06.672 --> 09:08.006
Can I come in?

09:08.006 --> 09:10.467
Of course, of course.
Come in. Come in.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.347
I was just about
to put on the game.

09:15.347 --> 09:17.849
You want a drink?
I got some light beer, even got

09:17.849 --> 09:20.185
- some real beer.
- Nah, I'm good.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.937
You know, I left you
a bunch of messages.

09:21.937 --> 09:25.607
What the hell happened
at that cemetery?

09:25.607 --> 09:29.319
Word is some hitters were trying
to take out Franz's wife, so

09:29.319 --> 09:31.530
I guess she was wrapped up
in what he was doing, huh?

09:31.530 --> 09:33.532
You know that's not true.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.659
- Sorry, what?
- You know

09:35.659 --> 09:37.369
as well as I do
that the only thing

09:37.369 --> 09:40.622
that Franz's wife
is wrapped up in is grief.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.374
I know you sold out Reacher

09:42.374 --> 09:43.792
and his team
when they went to Boston.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.920
And I know you're working
for those guys at New Age.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.297
Do me a favor.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.715
- What?
- Take a look at your shoes

09:49.715 --> 09:51.383
- for a second, would you?
- Don't get cute with me.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.635
Where the hell
do you think you're standing?

09:53.635 --> 09:55.470
You're in my house.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.222
My house,
where I brought up my kids,

09:57.222 --> 09:59.349
where I lived with my Connie--
God rest her soul--

09:59.349 --> 10:01.101
where we had you over
for dinner when you were

10:01.101 --> 10:02.853
a wet behind the ears punk,

10:02.853 --> 10:04.479
and you didn't know
which side of your gun

10:04.479 --> 10:05.897
the bullets came out.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.191
You come in my house
and you talk this shit to me?

10:08.191 --> 10:10.777
Two people knew that Reacher
and his team went to Boston:

10:10.777 --> 10:12.654
you and me.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.782
And I didn't sell them out
to get jumped. So who did?

10:21.997 --> 10:24.249
I'm making the smart play here,
all right?

10:24.249 --> 10:26.585
The hell does that mean?

10:26.585 --> 10:28.795
Look, the head of security
from, uh, New Age,

10:28.795 --> 10:29.963
- the guy, uh...
- Langston.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.214
That's right.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.467
He came to me when you
started poking around

10:33.467 --> 10:35.594
the-the Franz murder.

10:35.594 --> 10:38.096
He backed up
a truckload of cash

10:38.096 --> 10:40.599
and all he wanted to know
was what you were finding out,

10:40.599 --> 10:42.351
where the investigation
was heading.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.643
He just wanted updates,
that's it.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.604
- Just updates?
- Yes.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.190
After what this city's
been through?

10:48.190 --> 10:49.858
After 9/11?

10:49.858 --> 10:52.194
You're NYPD and you're aiding,
abetting terrorists?

10:52.194 --> 10:53.236
Hey, watch your fucking mouth.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.821
Fuck that!

10:54.821 --> 10:57.449
You are sullying the greatest
police force in the world.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.618
You're spitting on the grave
of everybody who died that day,

10:59.618 --> 11:01.203
died trying to save lives.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.955
Who the fuck are you
to bring up that day to me?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.624
I lost more friends that morning

11:05.624 --> 11:07.918
than you'll ever have
in your goddamn life!

11:08.919 --> 11:11.963
What they're doing
is-isn't about over here.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.298
All right?
It's about over there--

11:13.298 --> 11:15.300
China, the Middle East, Russia,

11:15.300 --> 11:17.260
the-the IRA
for all I give a shit.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.180
It has nothing to do with me,
you or this country, okay?

11:20.180 --> 11:23.225
Langston is a businessman.
He saw a play and he took it.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.893
These are crooked cops.

11:24.893 --> 11:27.437
These are-these are
bad fucking people.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.106
No shit.

11:29.106 --> 11:32.442
I've known guys like him,
you know guys like him.

11:32.442 --> 11:35.612
And your father definitely
knew guys like him.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.156
When they make an offer
it's not a suggestion,

11:38.156 --> 11:41.034
it's not a request,
it's an order.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.870
So, I damn well took that money
when they came to me

11:43.870 --> 11:46.081
and I kept my ass in one piece.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.083
That's what I care about.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.960
And what if you're wrong?

11:49.960 --> 11:52.003
What if you wake up
a few months from now

11:52.003 --> 11:54.673
and it's raining plane parts
in Los Angeles, Chicago,

11:54.673 --> 11:57.008
New York again?

11:57.008 --> 11:58.677
What are you gonna do
when you find out

11:58.677 --> 12:00.762
that they fucking lied to you?

12:00.762 --> 12:02.681
And don't ever bring up
my father again.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.808
Why not? I knew him well.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.685
I think about him all the time

12:06.685 --> 12:09.187
and what a good man he was.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.148
And a good cop
and how that good man

12:11.148 --> 12:13.692
is six feet underground.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.402
I don't want to go out that way

12:15.402 --> 12:17.863
and neither should you.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.823
They paid me, they'll pay you.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.867
Take the goddamn money.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.880
You didn't know my father.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.132
And you sure as hell
don't know me.

12:51.563 --> 12:54.483
Look at the kilos
coming in this week.

12:54.483 --> 12:56.651
We're gonna wrap this up
in a big way.

12:56.651 --> 12:59.237
Unfortunately,
you're not, Major.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.865
At ease.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.410
I need to speak
to you alone, Reacher.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.078
It's about
Operation Kite Runner.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.623
Respectfully, anything
you can say to me about the case

13:09.623 --> 13:11.583
can be said in front of Dixon.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.710
She's been working this matter
from the beginning,

13:13.710 --> 13:15.587
knows it better than anybody.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.922
Very well.

13:16.922 --> 13:19.257
I respect you too much
to pussyfoot this thing.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.343
The colonel's promotion's
going through.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.886
He's gonna be stationed
in South Korea

13:22.886 --> 13:25.263
at a base right near
the Demilitarized Zone.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.641
It's gonna be announced sometime
in the next three weeks.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.519
Waiting for the shoe
to drop, Hortense.

13:31.937 --> 13:34.898
Colonel's been gunning
for this promotion 20 years.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.775
There's no way a drug operation
that happened

13:36.775 --> 13:38.818
right under his nose
is gonna be publicized

13:38.818 --> 13:40.487
in a huge bust.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.322
It's not a good look.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.698
And it would be a bad mark

13:43.698 --> 13:46.368
on his otherwise stellar
military career.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.328
As a result,
Operation Kite Runner

13:48.328 --> 13:50.372
will be shut down immediately.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.040
This is bullshit.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.917
Don't let our friendship
affect your judgment.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.335
We don't have a friendship.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.003
We have a familiarity.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.089
With all due respect
to that familiarity,

13:59.089 --> 14:00.632
this is bullshit.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.760
Major Reacher,

14:03.760 --> 14:06.388
this is what will go
into your report:

14:06.388 --> 14:08.723
five misdemeanor charges
for drug use only,

14:08.723 --> 14:10.308
no charges for dealing, conspiracy

14:10.308 --> 14:12.769
or misappropriation
of military resources.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.563
One defendant will do time
in the brig,

14:14.563 --> 14:15.772
four will get probation,

14:15.772 --> 14:17.607
all will receive
honorable discharges,

14:17.607 --> 14:18.900
that's it.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.152
Do you understand your orders?

14:23.572 --> 14:25.115
Yes, sir.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.584
<i>Reacher?</i>

14:35.584 --> 14:37.586
Reacher?

14:39.588 --> 14:41.506
What's going through
your mind right now?

14:41.506 --> 14:43.550
Nothing.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.678
Just...

14:48.430 --> 14:51.141
...how the last big case
we all had together...

14:53.977 --> 14:55.895
How it all
went to shit at the end.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.818
And you're worried
how this one's gonna end?

15:01.818 --> 15:04.070
Part of it.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.072
Which part?

15:16.082 --> 15:17.292
Swan.

15:24.466 --> 15:25.967
You've done so much for me.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.386
I mean, for all of us.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.513
You trained us.

15:30.513 --> 15:31.890
So...

15:32.932 --> 15:34.976
So, when the time comes,
I'll do it.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.229
I'll kill Swan.

15:42.525 --> 15:43.943
Got her address.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.529
Seriously?

15:46.529 --> 15:48.865
- IP address or address address?
- Both.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.659
Soon as Jane started gaming--

15:50.659 --> 15:51.993
she sucks, by the way--

15:51.993 --> 15:53.828
I had tech services
in my office track her down.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.163
Got us a location an hour away.

15:57.082 --> 15:58.625
Dress quickly, boss.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.505
She should've used
the informal <i>"tu."</i>

16:08.385 --> 16:09.552
Thank you.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.181
Mm. Is Jane hungry?

16:13.181 --> 16:15.809
You've already done
more than enough.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.811
God, I'm so embarrassed
that we're imposing

16:17.811 --> 16:20.021
- on you like this.
- Don't you dare apologize.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.857
This isn't your fault, Marlo.

16:22.857 --> 16:25.235
I remember when I left Thomas.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.861
It's never easy.

16:29.239 --> 16:32.951
Why are my sprinklers going off
in the middle of winter?

16:34.911 --> 16:38.873
I swear I'm gonna fire
that groundskeeper.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.042
I'll be right back.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.563
Not a sound.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.233
Eight feet tall,

17:05.233 --> 17:06.568
300 pounds,

17:06.568 --> 17:08.737
and you got to hit
a woman to feel big?

17:08.737 --> 17:10.447
You're pathetic.

17:10.447 --> 17:13.491
Did Marlo tell you she was
running from an ex-boyfriend?

17:13.491 --> 17:15.243
She lied to you.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.536
Why would she do that?

17:16.536 --> 17:17.954
Great question.
Why don't you

17:17.954 --> 17:19.706
call her out here
and ask her yourself?

17:19.706 --> 17:22.167
And why the hell
should I listen to you?

17:22.167 --> 17:24.461
'Cause right now I have
a colleague in the car

17:24.461 --> 17:27.213
playing online games with Jane
to keep the kid busy.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.258
If you don't get Marlo out here
I'll go in and get her myself,

17:30.258 --> 17:32.510
but there'd be a whole lot
of screaming and carrying on

17:32.510 --> 17:34.137
and I'd like
to avoid traumatizing

17:34.137 --> 17:35.597
her daughter if possible.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.515
I won't do it.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.396
O'Donnell, switchblade.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.628
Homemade silencer.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.047
Call Marlo out here
or I'll shoot you in the leg.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.800
Scream, I shoot you in the head.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.092
Okay.

18:16.304 --> 18:19.516
Uh, Marlo, can you
come out here for a sec?

18:19.516 --> 18:21.059
Sit back down.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.938
Can't believe you fell for that.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.065
It's a 16th-inch of plastic.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.067
What...

18:34.113 --> 18:36.449
Hey, Marlo. How you been?

18:36.449 --> 18:38.368
Please don't hurt my daughter.

18:38.368 --> 18:39.953
Jane doesn't
have to be involved in this.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.871
Come on, take a seat.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.964
Why'd you send us
to get killed in an ambush?

18:50.964 --> 18:53.258
I-I don't know anything
about an ambush.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.426
- I'm sorry,
what exactly is going on?
- Shut up, Chad.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.428
You smiled
and gave me an address

18:57.428 --> 18:59.347
where a bunch of thugs
were about to take us out.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.224
Now, either you're a chump

19:01.224 --> 19:03.142
or you gladly threw us
into the lion's den.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.894
And when you found out
we took out your guys,

19:04.894 --> 19:06.813
you skipped town and used Chad
here as a human shield.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.273
- Can I just say...
- Shut up, Chad.

19:08.273 --> 19:11.276
I swear, I had no idea

19:11.276 --> 19:13.319
who or what was at the address
I gave you.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.363
Our head of security got spooked

19:15.363 --> 19:17.156
when you guys came around
asking questions.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.158
He told me
to give you that address.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.161
Oh, so now Langston's in charge,
not Tony Swan?

19:22.161 --> 19:24.831
No. He's the one trying
to stop all this.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.584
If you knew Tony Swan,

19:27.584 --> 19:29.043
then you would know
he'd never be involved

19:29.043 --> 19:30.670
in something like this.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.630
Some of us do.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.757
I hired Swan,

19:34.757 --> 19:36.593
jammed him on to
Langston's security team.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.553
- Why?
- Because New Age's

19:38.553 --> 19:40.555
security team was incestuous.

19:40.555 --> 19:42.932
They were all former cops
from the same precinct.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.142
So you trusted Swan?

19:44.142 --> 19:46.019
And I like to think
that he trusted me, too.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.479
That's why he came to me
when he found something

19:48.479 --> 19:50.440
- suspicious going on...
- Little Wing.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.151
How do you know about that?

19:53.151 --> 19:54.986
We know about the missiles,

19:54.986 --> 19:56.487
Senator Lavoy,

19:56.487 --> 19:58.781
everything except
how you fit into all this.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.825
Well, I didn't fit into it,

20:00.825 --> 20:02.827
not until Swan came to me.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.163
<i>He'd realized that chips</i>

20:05.163 --> 20:07.081
<i>being uploaded
with the Little Wing software</i>

20:07.081 --> 20:09.500
<i>were being flagged
as defective in numbers</i>

20:09.500 --> 20:11.544
<i>outside normal margin of error.</i>

20:11.544 --> 20:13.588
<i>Quality control
couldn't figure out why</i>

20:13.588 --> 20:15.423
<i>the failure rate
kept creeping up,</i>

20:15.423 --> 20:17.008
but management wanted to fulfill

20:17.008 --> 20:18.843
the Little Wing contract
on time,

20:18.843 --> 20:20.887
<i>and since the majority
of the chips tested fine,</i>

20:20.887 --> 20:22.138
<i>we chalked it up</i>

20:22.138 --> 20:23.181
<i>to a processing error</i>

20:23.181 --> 20:24.641
<i>and kept cranking out product.</i>

20:24.641 --> 20:27.268
But Swan thought someone
in engineering had manipulated

20:27.268 --> 20:29.145
the testing board
to randomly flag

20:29.145 --> 20:30.730
operational chips as defective.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.900
Any idea who in engineering
could have been involved?

20:33.900 --> 20:36.027
There's scores of engineers.
There's no way to know.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.654
What about management,
board of directors,

20:37.654 --> 20:39.530
any of the suits--
they in on it?

20:39.530 --> 20:41.908
None of us knew anything.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.535
Langston always said we were
all too busy counting our money

20:44.535 --> 20:45.995
to realize we were being robbed.

20:45.995 --> 20:49.082
These chips that were
being marked as defective--

20:49.082 --> 20:51.668
let me guess, 650 of them?

20:51.668 --> 20:53.920
That sounds right.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.339
I told Swan to report
his findings to Langston

20:56.339 --> 20:59.175
because I didn't know he was
involved at the time, but...

20:59.175 --> 21:01.469
Swan was cautious. He wanted
to do some more digging.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.054
He said that
he was going to bring in

21:03.054 --> 21:04.973
some of his trusted
army friends to help.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.059
Yeah, they were
our friends, too.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.353
Did Swan ever report back
about what they dug up?

21:10.353 --> 21:12.063
No.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.857
I never heard from him again.
He just disappeared.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.901
Not necessarily.
He was signing off on shipments

21:16.901 --> 21:18.403
as recently as yesterday.

21:18.403 --> 21:19.988
He's alive?

21:19.988 --> 21:21.447
Looks like it.

21:21.447 --> 21:22.782
They probably got him
held somewhere,

21:22.782 --> 21:24.659
setting him up to take the rap
for this thing.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.829
Yeah, well, Langston's
all about covering his ass.

21:27.829 --> 21:30.123
Right after Tony went missing
he called me into his office.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.709
He said that
as director of operations

21:32.709 --> 21:34.669
I was in a unique position

21:34.669 --> 21:37.338
to help cover up whatever it was
that Tony had exposed.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.382
Cut yourself a sweet deal
in the process.

21:39.382 --> 21:40.842
Found your bag of money.

21:40.842 --> 21:42.135
He made me take that so that

21:42.135 --> 21:43.803
I wouldn't look clean
in any of this.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.638
Well, you could have
just said no.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.306
Langston is vicious.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.017
He was a detective
for over 20 years

21:49.017 --> 21:51.936
and he helped some very unsavory
people avoid jail time

21:51.936 --> 21:53.855
just so he could keep them
in his back pocket.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.356
I mean, like a-a biker gang...

21:55.356 --> 21:56.649
Took care of them in Boston.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.817
And professional hit man and...

21:57.817 --> 21:59.318
Brooklyn Cemetery.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.611
And a lot of general lowlifes

22:00.611 --> 22:02.739
who would take someone out
for a few bucks.

22:02.739 --> 22:04.574
Buried in Atlantic City.

22:04.574 --> 22:08.119
The things that he said
he would have done to me,

22:08.119 --> 22:09.787
to my daughter.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.249
I can't even repeat it.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.876
That's why I ran.

22:16.127 --> 22:18.296
After two of you came around
asking questions,

22:18.296 --> 22:21.883
I was afraid Langston would
see me as a potential liability.

22:21.883 --> 22:23.843
He doesn't like loose ends.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.303
God knows what they're doing
to him right now.

22:25.303 --> 22:27.055
Half of what we'll do to him.

22:28.473 --> 22:29.474
You can go.

22:29.474 --> 22:32.310
Thank you.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.022
Marlo,

22:36.022 --> 22:38.191
don't take this
the wrong way, but...

22:38.191 --> 22:39.901
find a fucking hotel.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.861
We're looking
for someone

22:41.861 --> 22:44.530
who recently hijacked
a truckload of SAMs.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.033
How complicated is it to install
the Little Wing chips into them?

22:47.033 --> 22:48.951
He'd need his engineer
to demonstrate,

22:48.951 --> 22:51.829
but after that
he'd be fine on his own.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.873
Be nice to know
who his engineer is.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.417
We'll find out soon enough.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.503
We just have to ask Langston.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.616
Buyer will be landing soon.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.827
He's not gonna hand over a penny
unless he knows

23:30.827 --> 23:32.787
how to install those chips

23:32.787 --> 23:34.997
and fire those weapons
like he's rolling out of bed.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.749
Won't be a problem.
I will hold his hand.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.960
I will guide him
through the steps.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.878
And how long
is this tutorial gonna take?

23:40.878 --> 23:42.505
Well, I can run him
through the installation

23:42.505 --> 23:45.258
and activation very quickly.
Nothing to worry about.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.301
Yeah.

23:47.301 --> 23:50.346
Okay, well, don't spike the ball
just yet, Russ.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.475
Marlo.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.769
Where you been?
I've been concerned.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.312
<i>I had to
get out of town.</i>

23:58.312 --> 24:00.106
Those two women who came by

24:00.106 --> 24:02.608
asking about Saropian--
they brought a couple

24:02.608 --> 24:03.943
<i>of friends to track me down.</i>

24:03.943 --> 24:06.070
<i>They threatened me
and my daughter.</i>

24:06.070 --> 24:07.488
And what did you tell them?

24:07.488 --> 24:08.990
A bunch of lies.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.992
They're going to figure that out
sooner or later

24:10.992 --> 24:13.953
and when they do, I am terrified
they're gonna come back for us.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.663
Now, what did I say to you

24:15.663 --> 24:18.374
when I brought you
into this thing?

24:18.374 --> 24:20.668
That if you did what I said,
you'd make a lot of money

24:20.668 --> 24:22.795
and nothing would happen
to you and Janey.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.756
I'm a man of my word.
I can keep you both safe.

24:25.756 --> 24:28.843
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Outside the city.

24:28.843 --> 24:31.596
- Where? I'll come get you.
- <i>I-I mean, I'm calling</i>

24:31.596 --> 24:34.056
from a deli. I-I think
they're following me, so I...

24:34.056 --> 24:35.725
Look, I have to keep moving.

24:35.725 --> 24:39.228
Okay, okay. That's fine.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.105
Where could we meet?

24:58.915 --> 25:00.666
Making house calls now?

25:00.666 --> 25:03.002
Only when
shit's about to go down.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.004
We're luring Langston in
to take him out.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.506
Good. Let's get this asshole.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.884
I got a different job for you.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.344
That's Marlo.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.262
She works for New Age.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.806
She and her daughter are
on Langston's loose-end list.

25:15.806 --> 25:18.309
Marlo's the lure.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.228
Need someone to watch the kid.

25:22.104 --> 25:24.106
What am I,
a fucking babysitter now?

25:24.106 --> 25:26.776
Langston's bringing
at least four guys.

25:26.776 --> 25:28.653
A driver,
someone to watch his back,

25:28.653 --> 25:30.363
and two guys
to carry Marlo's body

25:30.363 --> 25:32.323
since bosses
don't do grunt work.

25:32.323 --> 25:34.242
I need my whole team.
That leaves you.

25:34.242 --> 25:36.702
I saw what you did
for Mikey in the cemetery.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.663
I know you'd do the same
for Jane.

25:45.253 --> 25:48.005
Fine, but we can't stay here.

25:48.005 --> 25:50.424
I cornered Marsh
and he copped to being

25:50.424 --> 25:51.634
on Langston's payroll.

25:51.634 --> 25:54.470
Told me to get with the program.

25:54.470 --> 25:55.596
And?

25:55.596 --> 25:57.390
I told him to fuck off.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.601
That's why you can't stay.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.353
Look,

26:02.353 --> 26:04.563
I know Marsh since
I was fresh out of the academy.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.065
I don't think he's gonna
make a move on me.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.109
But I'm going
to my cousin's house

26:08.109 --> 26:09.902
on Staten Island
for a day or two,

26:09.902 --> 26:11.612
just in case.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.409
I'll bring the girl with me.

26:16.409 --> 26:17.952
Appreciate it.

26:21.455 --> 26:24.083
When we finally have that fight,

26:24.083 --> 26:25.835
I'll let you take
the first swing.

26:25.835 --> 26:29.338
I don't need no handicapping,
pal. Trust me.

26:29.338 --> 26:31.465
I bet you don't.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.974
Hey, look, I'm-I'm
gonna be back soon.

26:39.974 --> 26:42.226
Everything's gonna be okay,
I promise.

26:42.226 --> 26:44.437
All right?

26:44.437 --> 26:46.856
- I'll be back soon.
- Yeah.

26:48.899 --> 26:51.319
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

26:51.319 --> 26:52.695
Yeah.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.780
We're using
this kid's mom as bait.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.200
So we better get it right.

27:08.711 --> 27:10.880
<i>Can you hear us?</i>

27:10.880 --> 27:12.423
Loud and clear.

27:12.423 --> 27:14.467
<i>Good. Keep us on speaker,</i>

27:14.467 --> 27:15.968
<i>put the phone in your pocket.</i>

27:15.968 --> 27:17.345
<i>We'll be right here
listening in.</i>

27:20.890 --> 27:23.684
Oh, I don't know
if I can do this.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.854
Just take a breath. We got you.

27:30.608 --> 27:32.234
Okay.

27:33.611 --> 27:35.279
You're gonna listen to my voice
and you're gonna run

27:35.279 --> 27:37.031
when I tell you to run.
We clear on that?

27:37.031 --> 27:38.991
Clear.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.534
<i>As soon as you're
gone, we're gonna come up</i>

27:40.534 --> 27:41.952
<i>behind him and block the exit.</i>

27:41.952 --> 27:44.372
<i>O'Donnell and Dixon'll
box them in.</i>

27:46.123 --> 27:47.208
Well, and then what?

27:48.751 --> 27:49.877
Then we'll kill him.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.969
Someone's coming.

27:58.969 --> 28:01.597
Okay, stay cool.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.521
You buckled up?

28:32.336 --> 28:33.712
Up ahead.

28:33.712 --> 28:37.133
Easy. Don't spook her.

28:37.133 --> 28:38.676
It's gonna be okay.

28:38.676 --> 28:40.594
You're gonna like Staten Island.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.304
We'll stop by Ariemma's,

28:42.304 --> 28:44.682
get a chicken cutlet sandwich,

28:44.682 --> 28:47.768
maybe watch an Adam Sandler
movie or something.

28:47.768 --> 28:49.895
You'll be back
with your mom in no time.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.279
Jane...

28:58.279 --> 29:00.072
get in the back
and keep your head down.

29:19.550 --> 29:21.135
Just stay down.

29:29.643 --> 29:31.562
<i>Hey, they
tracked us down.</i>

29:31.562 --> 29:33.063
Marsh or Langston?

29:33.063 --> 29:34.607
I don't know
and I don't give a shit,

29:34.607 --> 29:37.026
but we're under
heavy automatic fire.

29:37.026 --> 29:38.277
Fuck!

29:38.277 --> 29:39.862
It's Russo. We got to go.

29:39.862 --> 29:42.990
- Wait, wh-what's wrong?
- Who the hell
is she talking to?

29:42.990 --> 29:44.283
Is Jane in trouble?

29:44.283 --> 29:46.494
Fuck, it's a setup. Get her.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.290
That's Reacher. Kill him!

30:15.689 --> 30:17.107
Go, go, go, go!

30:48.222 --> 30:49.890
It's Neagley. Get in.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.517
Hurry!

30:54.728 --> 30:56.855
What in the fuck was that?

30:56.855 --> 30:58.315
They found Russo. We got to go.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.694
What are you doing? Get in.

31:01.694 --> 31:04.613
Go find Jane. I'm not done here.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.115
I'm staying with Reacher.

31:06.115 --> 31:07.908
No. They've got
automatic weapons.

31:07.908 --> 31:10.202
Russo's outmanned, outgunned,
and has a kid with him.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.870
You all need to go.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.206
Shit. Get down!

31:19.128 --> 31:21.672
- There he goes. Get him.
- But Burns...

31:21.672 --> 31:23.424
Later. I want that big fuck.

31:36.687 --> 31:38.731
Russo, what's your 20?

31:38.731 --> 31:40.774
I'm heading east.

31:40.774 --> 31:42.901
Keep heading towards Queens.
We're gonna intercept.

33:08.278 --> 33:09.613
Help!

34:49.963 --> 34:53.133
Where the fuck are you guys?
I can't lose them.

34:53.133 --> 34:54.218
Location?

34:54.218 --> 34:55.803
Just passed 104th.

34:55.803 --> 34:57.179
We're close, all right?

34:57.179 --> 34:59.765
<i>Just keep them off your ass.</i>

34:59.765 --> 35:00.933
Hurry up.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.144
Son of a bitch!

35:06.396 --> 35:08.398
Hold on!

35:16.573 --> 35:18.742
Keep him blocked in.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.495
You okay?

35:21.495 --> 35:22.621
Okay, don't move

35:22.621 --> 35:24.957
- till I come and get you.
- Okay.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.352
It's just you and me now, Langston.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.938
This place is surrounded
by a barbed-wire fence,

35:47.938 --> 35:51.066
there's only one exit and you
got to get past me to reach it.

36:07.374 --> 36:10.002
You killed the wrong guy's
friends, asshole.

36:43.285 --> 36:44.494
Let's go, let's go!

37:28.497 --> 37:29.831
Come on!

37:32.668 --> 37:35.629
Keep your head down.

37:39.049 --> 37:40.801
Come on. Get behind the tires.

37:40.801 --> 37:42.344
Come on.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.933
When I say so, you run
as fast as you can. Okay?

37:47.933 --> 37:49.518
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

37:49.518 --> 37:52.229
I promise I won't let
anything happen to you.

37:52.229 --> 37:54.106
But you have to do what I say.

37:54.106 --> 37:56.692
I want you to run down that way.

37:56.692 --> 37:59.653
And whatever you do,
don't look back.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.241
- Okay?
- Okay.

38:04.241 --> 38:06.201
Come on. Come on.

38:06.201 --> 38:07.786
Ready?

38:07.786 --> 38:09.579
Now!

38:31.268 --> 38:32.686
Come on!

38:48.160 --> 38:50.620
It's not always fair, kid.

38:57.627 --> 39:00.505
Jane. Jane!

39:00.505 --> 39:01.882
Oh.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.636
Oh, baby.

39:06.636 --> 39:09.556
- Clear.
- Clear.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.769
Call 911!

39:13.769 --> 39:15.228
Copy that.

39:15.228 --> 39:16.897
Oh, fuck.

39:16.897 --> 39:18.023
Shit.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.652
Hold on, Russo.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.279
Help is on the way.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.323
The girl?

39:26.323 --> 39:28.700
- What?
- The girl.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.036
She's okay. She's safe.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.110
Ambulance is on its way.
