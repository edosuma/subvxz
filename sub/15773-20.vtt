The security guard,

01:06.704 --> 01:08.434
he lost his job.

01:09.304 --> 01:11.366
I guess instead of catching Zs,

01:11.377 --> 01:13.826
he should have been
catching thieves.

bolts for breakfast?

01:48.834 --> 01:49.436
No.

burrito every day.

01:56.220 --> 01:58.017
And do you know why you can't?

01:58.095 --> 02:01.148
Because robots don't have souls.

Now, can someone
please tell me what

02:05.260 --> 02:06.666

if you're gonna live here,

02:33.499 --> 02:35.053
you have to pull your own weight.

were looking for a job.

behavior.

a blueberry muffin.

09:04.547 --> 09:05.625
Mmm.

09:05.641 --> 09:09.083
My grand mammy used to
make a lemon poppy seed.

But those old poppy
seeds love to get all

You know, as a boy,

09:22.183 --> 09:25.214
I used to suck the jam
out with a straw.
