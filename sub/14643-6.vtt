- Ready?
- Let's go.

00:31.698 --> 00:35.568
- [bell rings]
- No homework. Huh, Tyler?

00:35.635 --> 00:36.770
{\an8}- Oh, no.

00:36.836 --> 00:38.505
{\an8}I have a tons.

00:38.571 --> 00:39.773
{\an8}Right, Glenn?

00:39.839 --> 00:42.475
{\an8}- He sure does.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.078
{\an8}I once carried Tyler
on my back for a week

00:45.145 --> 00:46.279
{\an8}when he sprained his pinkie toe.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.248
{\an8}Apparently, he's allergic
to wheelchairs.

00:48.314 --> 00:51.918
{\an8}[laughs] Those crazy
Dudas.

00:51.985 --> 00:55.021
{\an8}- Stupid pyramid!

00:55.088 --> 00:56.990
{\an8}- [cat meows]
- I think Sam's still mad

00:57.056 --> 00:59.292
{\an8}about that B
on his history project.

00:59.359 --> 01:01.327
{\an8}- How do you give this a B?

01:01.394 --> 01:03.296
{\an8}I mean, this is
after I kicked it.

01:03.363 --> 01:07.667
{\an8}But try to imagine it before.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.569
{\an8}Huh?

01:09.636 --> 01:10.603
{\an8}- Relax, Bro.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.905
{\an8}It was a hard assignment.

01:11.971 --> 01:13.940
{\an8}- But I've never gotten
a B before!

01:14.007 --> 01:14.808
{\an8}I mean, what's next?

01:14.874 --> 01:15.842
{\an8}A B minus?

01:15.909 --> 01:17.544
{\an8}I'm slipping, guys.

01:17.610 --> 01:19.712
{\an8}I'm slipping.

01:19.779 --> 01:20.947
{\an8}- Hi, humans.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.817
{\an8}Y'all see what
they're setting up?

01:23.883 --> 01:25.952

01:26.019 --> 01:27.620
{\an8}Happy days!

01:27.687 --> 01:30.990
{\an8}- Our old elementary school's
having the annual fun fair.

01:31.057 --> 01:33.359
{\an8}- Life was so easy
in fifth grade.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.427
{\an8}- I know.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.296
{\an8}- They didn't even have
letter grades.

01:36.362 --> 01:40.667
{\an8}You know, I never got less than
three smiley face stickers?

01:40.733 --> 01:41.968
{\an8}- I have an idea.

01:42.035 --> 01:45.104
{\an8}Seriously, this is one
of the best ideas I've ever had.

01:45.171 --> 01:47.740
{\an8}When you hear this idea--
- Just tell us.

01:47.807 --> 01:49.442
{\an8}- Let's go back and visit.

01:49.509 --> 01:52.445
{\an8}- But the fun fair's
just for elementary kids.

01:52.512 --> 01:54.614
- Or is it?

01:54.681 --> 01:56.816
- It is.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.251
- Or is it?

02:01.087 --> 02:02.422
- It is.

02:06.893 --> 02:10.295
- If the key to getting in
anywhere is to use fake names,

02:10.363 --> 02:14.000
then I'm the master
at fake names.

02:14.067 --> 02:18.738
Okay, just follow my lead.

02:18.805 --> 02:24.143
Hey, it's me, fifth grader
Cubby Bubblegum,

02:24.210 --> 02:27.180
and my brother--
- Tito von Milkshake.

02:27.247 --> 02:28.481
Nice to meet you.

02:28.548 --> 02:32.685
- And our friend Blue,
his wife, Yellow,

02:32.752 --> 02:33.653
and our Cousin Beyoncé.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.754
- What's up?

02:34.821 --> 02:37.457
- Why does she always
get to be Beyoncé?

02:37.524 --> 02:39.425
- I told you I was the master.

02:42.061 --> 02:44.764
Even more magical
than I remember.

02:44.831 --> 02:49.269
- This is where we can grab
some laughter and some funshine.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.070
- I'm just here to see
how much cotton candy

02:51.137 --> 02:52.672
I can fit in my mouth.

02:52.739 --> 02:53.573
And that's a lot.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.678
- You brought
your yearbook?

02:58.745 --> 02:59.779
- I wanna get it signed.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.514
I was sick the last day
of fifth grade.

03:01.581 --> 03:03.449
Got poison ivy
on my tongue.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.985
- How did you get--
you know what?

03:06.052 --> 03:07.820
Never mind. [giggles]

03:07.887 --> 03:08.955
- Hey there, stranger.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.723
Would you mind signing
my yearbook?

03:10.790 --> 03:13.393
- ♪

03:17.931 --> 03:19.065
- This is awesome.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.234
[laughs] I really miss
this place.

03:21.301 --> 03:24.070
- I didn't think anything
could top the porta potty.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.872
But this comes close.

03:25.939 --> 03:29.842
- Tyler Duda is on fire.

03:29.909 --> 03:32.111
This used to be so hard.

03:32.178 --> 03:33.913
Now it's so easy.

03:33.980 --> 03:38.017
- That's because we got big
and the game stayed small.

03:38.084 --> 03:39.886
- You realize what this means?

03:39.953 --> 03:41.721
We can win all these games.

03:41.788 --> 03:44.490
Think how nice it'll be
to win something

03:44.557 --> 03:48.127
after one of us
got a C minus in math.

03:48.194 --> 03:49.262
It was me.

03:49.329 --> 03:52.332
I got the C minus.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.934
- Maybe we don't have to play
all of the games.

03:58.104 --> 03:59.405
- Two years ago, Sam got trapped

03:59.472 --> 04:01.307
in one of those
inflatable balls.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.409
He rolled down a hill,
across the highway,

04:03.476 --> 04:05.078
and wound up in Minnow Lake.

04:05.144 --> 04:07.513
That's how he got the nickname
Ball Boy.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.617
I gave him that nickname.

04:10.683 --> 04:11.851
Don't worry...

04:11.918 --> 04:12.986
Ball Boy.

04:13.052 --> 04:14.220
- TYLER: Come on.

04:14.287 --> 04:16.889
You don't want to keep
the prizes waiting.

04:16.956 --> 04:20.360
- I'm gonna stay here
and set some goldfish free.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.728
[whispers] Mom is coming for ya.

04:21.793 --> 04:24.631
If I could,
I'd set them all free.

04:24.697 --> 04:27.333
Aren't we all just human fish

04:27.400 --> 04:31.871
swimming
in the big bowl of life?

04:31.938 --> 04:35.208
- I'm gonna go inside and check
out the wall of achievement.

04:35.274 --> 04:36.843
I used to be
all over that thing.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.712
- ♪

04:45.084 --> 04:46.753
- The wall of achievement.

04:46.819 --> 04:48.121
Hello, old friend.

04:48.187 --> 04:51.157
It's me, Sam Duda.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.394
Wait.

04:54.460 --> 04:58.064
What happened to my many,
many achievements?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.033
Payton Bolas?

05:00.099 --> 05:01.768
Perfect attendance?

Spelling bee champ?

Best hair?

05:06.973 --> 05:07.940
Oh, come on.

05:08.007 --> 05:09.142
Who is this guy?

05:09.208 --> 05:11.310
And what has he done
with all the Duda?

05:16.282 --> 05:17.684
- Is that all you got?

05:24.157 --> 05:29.195
I'm king of the fair!

05:29.262 --> 05:31.197
I'm king of the fair! What!

05:31.264 --> 05:33.132
I'm king of the fair! Hey!

05:33.199 --> 05:35.101
I'm king of the fair! Yeah!

05:35.168 --> 05:36.302
- The fair's been great so far.

05:36.369 --> 05:37.970
Tyler and Gigi have been
winning every game.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.006
And I've been getting
my yearbook signed.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.075
Apparently, everyone wants me
to have a great summer.

05:42.141 --> 05:43.309
You know what?

05:43.376 --> 05:44.711
I think I will.

05:53.820 --> 05:58.491
- Payton Bolas
has my old locker?

05:58.558 --> 06:01.194
That's not even how
you spell rules.

06:01.260 --> 06:04.497
- [cheering]

06:04.564 --> 06:06.999
- This isn't as much fun
as I remember.

06:07.066 --> 06:08.701
- It's a pretty sad race.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.069
We're walking.

06:10.136 --> 06:11.738
And we're winning.

06:11.804 --> 06:14.440
- We've been totally dominating
the fun fair.

06:14.507 --> 06:18.311
Are you guys even trying?

06:18.377 --> 06:21.380
At this point,
it's neither fun or fair.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.349
It's impossible to lose.

06:23.416 --> 06:24.584
- Face it.

06:24.650 --> 06:27.386
We've outgrown the fun fair.

06:27.453 --> 06:29.055
- MALE ANNOUNCER:
We have a winner!

06:29.122 --> 06:31.991

and your Aunt Gigi.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.159
- Another one?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.761
We already have five.

06:34.827 --> 06:38.030
- And this is your distant
cousin, Neiderprum.

06:38.097 --> 06:39.866
- I breathe air.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.473

students.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.443
The bouncies
are now off limits.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.812
Everyone
out of the bouncies.

06:52.879 --> 06:55.815
And we are officially
out of prizes.

06:59.118 --> 07:00.820
- Who are those punks?

07:00.887 --> 07:04.190
- Oh, that's Cubby Bubblegum
and his Cousin Beyoncé.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.892
- PAYTON: They're going down.

07:05.958 --> 07:09.829
Nobody gets in the way
of my bouncy.

07:12.298 --> 07:14.567
Nobody.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.469
- Turns out, when you take
all their prizes

07:16.536 --> 07:22.408
and deflate their bouncy house,
kids get mad.

07:22.475 --> 07:26.879
- [screaming]

07:26.946 --> 07:28.748
- Is everything okay?
- NEIDERPRUM: Yeah, Sam.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.817
We're just screaming and running
for no reason.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.084
- Let's go!

07:32.151 --> 07:38.090
- [screaming]

07:39.792 --> 07:41.661
- Why are they chasing us?

07:41.727 --> 07:45.364
- We might've took the fun
out of fun fair.

07:45.431 --> 07:46.899
- We broke the bouncy house,

07:46.966 --> 07:49.202
won all the prizes,
and ate all the cotton candy.

07:49.268 --> 07:50.336
Oh, we were busy.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.238
- And I didn't do
anything wrong.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.739
I'm just along for the ride.

07:53.806 --> 07:54.740
- NEIDERPRUM: Guys, come on.
I found a way out.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.442
Come on.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.113
- Let's get 'em, Payton.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.849
- Payton?

08:02.915 --> 08:05.518
Payton Bolas?

08:05.585 --> 08:08.187
It's the kid
who stole my life.

08:08.254 --> 08:12.158
Come on, that kid
won best hair?

08:12.225 --> 08:14.026
- Well, well, well.

08:14.093 --> 08:15.995
Old man Sam Duda.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.531
I've been hearing about you
since the first grade.

08:18.598 --> 08:22.034
It's nice to finally meet you,
or should I say ...

08:22.101 --> 08:23.436
beat you.

08:23.502 --> 08:26.439
- Sick burn, Payton.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.641
- Sure, life's great now.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.610
But one day you'll stop
getting stickers

08:30.676 --> 08:32.445
and you'll start getting
letter grades.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.580
And how smart will you be?

08:34.647 --> 08:38.317
- Still smarter than you,
Duda.

08:38.384 --> 08:39.751
- I tell you what.

08:39.818 --> 08:42.889
I challenge you to a game
of your choice.

08:42.955 --> 08:46.592
If I win,
my friends and I go home.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.462
If you win, you guys
can egg us all you want.

08:49.528 --> 08:53.633
- Um,
should we vote on this?

08:53.699 --> 08:55.768
- Let's see
how you do man to man.

08:55.835 --> 08:59.772
Or should I say
man to baby?

08:59.839 --> 09:03.175
- Maybe not
the sickest burn, Sam.

09:03.242 --> 09:04.710
- You're on.

09:04.777 --> 09:09.282
And I pick
the inflatable ball race.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.684
- [gasping]
- Yeah.

09:11.751 --> 09:14.754
I know about that.

09:16.122 --> 09:19.926
Try not to roll into the lake,
Ball Boy.

09:19.992 --> 09:23.663
- [sighs]
- I can't do this.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.598
- Remember when
I fell off that horse,

09:25.665 --> 09:27.266
and you told me to get back on?

09:27.333 --> 09:29.201
- That was
a merry-go-round.

09:29.268 --> 09:30.469
- It was.

09:30.536 --> 09:32.371
And this ball
is your horse.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.273
Sam, you got this.

09:34.340 --> 09:35.975
- Yeah.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.310
Come on.

09:37.376 --> 09:39.745
Get into there.

09:41.314 --> 09:45.484
- [cheering]
- I hate rolling.

09:45.551 --> 09:46.452
It can roll.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.254
It does roll.

09:48.321 --> 09:52.124
- Is that all you've got,
Duda?

09:52.191 --> 09:55.161
- How is that kid so fast?

09:55.227 --> 09:56.195
- Go get it, Sam!

09:56.262 --> 10:00.099
- Oh, oh no.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.302
I can't see anything.

10:03.369 --> 10:07.840

10:07.907 --> 10:10.076

all over again.

10:10.142 --> 10:11.177
- Oh no!

10:11.243 --> 10:12.578
It's okay!

10:12.645 --> 10:13.779
- I can't stop.
