<P> Waiter, a table!

02:56.172 --> 02:59.257
Harry, what is it?

03:04.307 --> 03:06.549
Harry!

03:28.504 --> 03:31.589
Dorothy!

03:38.934 --> 03:42.019
Oh! Harry

03:49.363 --> 03:55.569
It's the most natural thing in the world
, the wound opens in the face

03:55.788 --> 04:00.368
to reality. So what does?
Try it again in his dreams.

04:00.586 --> 04:03.920
In some
mode is quite fun.

04:04.382 --> 04:08.713
Yes, it's terrible
the time.?

04:09.180 --> 04:12.881
It's okay. The
car is parked.

04:13.352 --> 04:17.160
I'm going back to activity sooner
need to think about other things..

04:17.940 --> 04:22.798
Good idea. But do not overdo
immediately.

04:23.260 --> 04:27.493
At least for
while. Have the recipe?

04:28.162 --> 04:30.204
Close to my heart.

04:30.248 --> 04:35.629
Do not be afraid to use it.
May feel strange at first

04:35.838 --> 04:37.290
<P> but do not panic.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.591
need a little work alone.

04:42.868 --> 04:45.953
So, are you ready?

04:46.936 --> 04:50.021
No, but what
else can I do?

04:50.899 --> 04:53.984
Do not forget,
tranquility.

04:54.654 --> 04:58.783
Our brain is a delicate network
Some wires may have been

04:59.034 --> 05:03.163
forced. Avoid excesses.

05:03.373 --> 05:07.537
There was a lot of pressure
have to take a break.

06:08.079 --> 06:12.208
Attention please! Move away
the edge of the platform.

06:12.877 --> 06:16.377

06:45.793 --> 06:49.127
Who are you really
Who sent you?

06:49.339 --> 06:53.504
He told the truth! He was not
near you.

06:53.719 --> 06:56.840
Do not knock
No one tried to push..

06:57.057 --> 07:00.142
- Must have stumbled
- Attention.! Train 308

07:00.395 --> 07:03.930
for New York, is making its entry
!

07:07.528 --> 07:10.614
It's crazy.

07:10.866 --> 07:15.196
<! P> Expect
To stop the train at all stations.

07:15.455 --> 07:19.269
It is the train to New York

Like to see something for a young man.

07:47.683 --> 07:50.867
I understand. Can I make a suggestion

07:50.916 --> 07:52.229
Okay.

07:59.010 --> 08:00.053
On-the-sun
Rosa.

08:01.827 --> 08:03.287
It is a personal product.

08:05.894 --> 08:06.729
I liked.

08:08.334 --> 08:09.959
Gift Wrap?

08:10.733 --> 08:12.248
Why not?

08:42.438 --> 08:43.855
You'll be there all day?

09:03.924 --> 09:08.364
No, no, it was mistake. There must be thousands
. May have been mistaken.

09:09.035 --> 09:13.686
I'm sorry, sir. But
is the only On-the-sun rose.

09:13.937 --> 09:18.066
Sorry ma'am, as I told you
have very white skin

09:18.943 --> 09:23.072
and this is the right tone, the tone is
peach.

09:23.324 --> 09:24.318
Peach, Peach, oh! Yes.

09:46.582 --> 09:48.207
Good morning, my dear

09:52.694 --> 09:54.979

You can not have any
Maybe not expect any..

10:04.208 --> 10:05.623
No!

10:10.779 --> 10:14.177
Harry, Harry,
how are you?

10:15.264 --> 10:17.932
I do not know. Harry
may be anxious.

10:18.601 --> 10:21.054
I'm so sorry about the death of Dorothy
.

10:23.141 --> 10:24.497
Listen, I came to find
with my sister here.

10:24.546 --> 10:27.737
Just want to know if something happens
my back.

10:28.822 --> 10:31.361
Something like

10:31.576 --> 10:36.073
As for who followed me
and tried to kill me at the station?

10:36.332 --> 10:38.787
I found you and this gives me
Maybe it's a joke, but

10:38.835 --> 10:40.043
I do not think funny.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.298
Cynthia! Harry! Harry
! Cynthia!

10:46.303 --> 10:47.445
<P> - How will

10:50.266 --> 10:54.846
You will receive a call saying
where to get your gift.

10:55.064 --> 10:57.043
Not me

10:58.193 --> 11:01.111
Listen, we have to go, Harry
will have to forgive us, and we were led

11:01.322 --> 11:03.920
Adrian!

11:07.413 --> 11:09.559
And Dave Quittle?

11:12.002 --> 11:15.703
Harry, I think we should take care
. Let's go.

11:19.302 --> 11:19.884
Who is?

11:20.095 --> 11:24.953
As I said,
an old friend.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.292
Who the hell are you?

13:00.054 --> 13:03.139
Hello! Thank God you came
.

13:03.391 --> 13:07.722
I thought something had happened
Today I will take the job..

13:08.398 --> 13:12.527
The washing machine is in the kitchen
See if you can do something with it..

13:13.612 --> 13:18.240
Sometimes
dry when you're washing.

13:18.452 --> 13:21.489
<P> It's a disaster.

13:30.801 --> 13:32.227
Who are you?

13:32.970 --> 13:37.760
Do not know? It is an eminent actress. By
you are here with your animals?

13:38.018 --> 13:41.709
Your apartment? It's my apartment.
If not leave now I call the police.

13:41.710 --> 13:43.022
You have not answered my question
.

13:43.441 --> 13:49.022
I can not waste time.
Have to be at the museum in 18 minutes.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.361
Please, nothing stops him.

13:53.245 --> 13:54.845
Sorry, kitten.

13:54.914 --> 14:00.295
One minute, my friend. Ellie
'm Fabian, you can check at school

14:00.505 --> 14:04.634
I graduated Pinceton
all steps

14:04.885 --> 14:09.050
to rent this apartment I paid
per month and the deposit

14:09.266 --> 14:10.717
on behalf of Ms. Hannan.

14:10.726 --> 14:13.287
Harry Hannan.

14:14.856 --> 14:16.137
So are you.

14:16.358 --> 14:17.395
If you do not mind.

14:17.505 --> 14:19.997
<P> Do you mind if
changed things around you?

14:20.008 --> 14:21.882
No, it's okay.

14:22.511 --> 14:26.779
Do not get mad at me.
Understand that it is unpleasant to come

14:26.996 --> 14:30.746
home and find a stranger there.

14:30.959 --> 14:35.124
It's like a dog lifting the
paw on its territory, this

14:35.340 --> 14:39.504
A
apartment would not like.

14:39.720 --> 14:43.885
It is more than unpleasant,
is the worst that can happen.

14:44.101 --> 14:48.265
Look, it's very simple. This is
owned by my company and

14:48.481 --> 14:52.610
when I'm out, lease
Someone made a mistake

14:52.862 --> 14:54.111
will fix soon.

14:54.113 --> 15:00.155
Listen, I have the key and
receipts, and give back

15:00.371 --> 15:03.914
Besides, who assures me that you are
Mr. Hannan?

15:09.383 --> 15:13.512
<P> Sometimes
have to remember who is boss. Is satisfied?

15:13.972 --> 15:17.673
I will clarify this confusion
, I promise.

15:17.935 --> 15:21.120
They said you would
definitely gone.

15:21.126 --> 15:22.685
No, they did not say that.

15:23.630 --> 15:24.418
I assure you said.

15:25.403 --> 15:28.738
It said
temporary absence.

15:28.740 --> 15:31.095
Definitely
is the exact word.

15:36.500 --> 15:40.629
Before I forget,
found this on the floor.

15:49.746 --> 15:52.101
I do not read Greek.

15:53.187 --> 15:56.273
It's not Greek. It's Hebrew.

15:56.483 --> 15:58.335
What do you say?

15:58.340 --> 16:03.365
I do not know Hebrew, know only
figures. The range letter

16:03.575 --> 16:07.740
looks like Greek. And this is
as an omega, the difference

16:08.206 --> 16:11.077
Ok, ok, it's ridiculous
Who left it.?

16:11.335 --> 16:12.855
<P> I do not know. Someone pushed
under the door!

16:12.858 --> 16:18.279
Do not yell at me. Who is to blame
! Where is Mrs. Hannan?

16:20.159 --> 16:21.367
Ms. Hannan is dead.

17:37.485 --> 17:41.614
Harry, this is very unpleasant
Why are you saying that someone

17:41.824 --> 17:46.202
tried to throw him under the train
? Saw who it was?

17:46.663 --> 17:50.479
There were no witnesses?

17:50.898 --> 17:53.503
And not without
suspicion..

17:54.339 --> 17:55.588
Someone did.

17:55.591 --> 17:58.092
It can be.
Nobody knew you were released.

17:59.033 --> 18:02.879
It's too good to be released. Why not
that told me to come back?

18:03.726 --> 18:09.003
Harry, I prefer to relax over
few days, do not panic, reflecting

18:09.087 --> 18:12.797
Do not adopt patronizing tone
me you bastard.

18:13.321 --> 18:15.678
<P> rent my apartment,
missions gives me blank.

18:16.826 --> 18:17.832
Send me mad letters.

18:17.869 --> 18:22.394
I'm ready to start
've been out two months

18:22.395 --> 18:25.307
Harry, more than three months.

18:28.173 --> 18:28.858
Two.

18:30.677 --> 18:34.378
116 days.
Not need to bother.

18:34.953 --> 18:39.185
Eckart, takes work.

18:39.855 --> 18:43.045
Hannan, you have suffered a big blow
. Psychiatric treatment.

18:43.046 --> 18:46.272
Depression is serious.
Do not tell me these things.

18:47.260 --> 18:51.702
Shall I tell you that one of our
tried to throw him on the train?

18:54.665 --> 18:58.794
That's it? Look, I think that is
whatever

18:58.795 --> 19:04.000
but we have nothing to
see. It's not my style.

19:05.929 --> 19:08.180
Hannan, forget all that.

19:11.353 --> 19:13.290
keep in touch.

19:18.841 --> 19:20.164
Thank you.

19:22.283 --> 19:24.857
<P> Silence by
Please, please ,.

19:26.997 --> 19:31.126
I do not like fights between
students, calm down.

19:31.586 --> 19:35.917
This is the synagogue is
very seriously. OK.

20:03.918 --> 20:05.231
Interesting.

20:07.569 --> 20:10.864
I have not had many requests like this
Mr. Hannan.

20:13.159 --> 20:14.507
Where
your friend got it?

20:14.932 --> 20:19.515
Not sure. Actually
never seen anything like it.

20:19.772 --> 20:24.523
I'm not surprised
Tell me, your friend is Jewish.?

20:26.447 --> 20:29.011
I never asked
ashamed.

20:29.951 --> 20:33.889
He works for the government
in agriculture.

20:33.998 --> 20:37.188
Well, I would say it has been
victim of a prank.

20:37.815 --> 20:43.468
This is Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic
exactly. Goel Hadam!

20:44.177 --> 20:46.629
It is a message? What do you say?

20:46.952 --> 20:53.625
<P> A curse, a curse
special. Goel Hadam blood avenger.

20:54.607 --> 20:58.736
Those other letters, the
m ze, I can not decipher.

20:58.946 --> 21:03.408
May be the initial
avenger or

21:03.618 --> 21:07.699
a name, something
As for the rest

21:08.166 --> 21:12.793
well, I guess
it is a death threat.

21:13.798 --> 21:15.316
Blood Avenger, huh?

21:17.406 --> 21:19.798
And the elders of his city,
sending the convict to

21:20.014 --> 21:23.830
be handed over
avenger of blood to die.

21:24.144 --> 21:24.597
Where is it?

21:25.542 --> 21:29.915
In Deuteronomy,
Chapter 19, verse 12.

21:32.676 --> 21:35.751
This belongs to
time of the First Temple

21:37.369 --> 21:42.228
more 2,500 years ago.
Your friend has nothing to fear.

21:43.272 --> 21:45.150
He will be very happy to hear this
.

21:45.504 --> 21:49.832
<P> Okay. Very
thanks for your time.

21:53.639 --> 21:56.407
If I want to look it up,
where can I find it?

21:57.290 --> 21:59.540
In the book, two "h".

22:07.302 --> 22:09.658
- Sam, Josh is Drexel
- Yes, Josh.. Is there something?

22:09.868 --> 22:13.506
We'd better hurry
I am a living proof for you..

24:00.881 --> 24:01.663
Do not believe it.

24:01.700 --> 24:02.446
We need to talk.

24:02.447 --> 24:05.008
This has to be well adjusted
.

24:05.742 --> 24:06.985
What's this?

24:07.724 --> 24:10.538
Chemical Bath
before airing.

24:10.540 --> 24:11.789
It makes people what they want
also do to you, huh?

24:13.043 --> 24:16.164
It misconception me
How did you find me?

24:17.111 --> 24:22.110
You are an anthropologist and made a study
Sluts of New York.

24:22.117 --> 24:23.357
Prostitutes, Mr. Hannan.

24:24.307 --> 24:27.643
<P> It's also smart and not
cares appearance

24:27.645 --> 24:30.763
and it's not stupid to work
companies that do not provide security.

24:33.527 --> 24:37.031
It has no merit. Left his
disseminated life in my apartment.

24:37.866 --> 24:41.923
Your clothes, your cards, photos,
we just need the cervical cancer test.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.435
I'm sorry. I'll send it to you
. How rude you are.

24:44.958 --> 24:48.809
Yes, I admit. Here it is.

24:50.319 --> 24:50.980
What's this?

24:51.821 --> 24:53.813
Go for a
hotel before dark.

24:53.928 --> 24:55.385
Before dark, why?

24:55.805 --> 24:58.306
You do not have to. Just get out.

24:58.621 --> 25:00.486
Came here to increase my tension

25:00.915 --> 25:02.062
I think someone's trying to kill me
.

25:02.375 --> 25:05.400
<P> This is not enough.
Give me an address and I'll try

25:06.131 --> 25:09.049
I'm sending, I will send

25:10.970 --> 25:12.908
Beware the net!

25:33.915 --> 25:34.577
As with the items?

25:34.792 --> 25:37.931
Do not worry
with them. OK?

25:39.130 --> 25:43.468
I'm fine. Go
before dark.

29:19.406 --> 29:21.657
David Quittle, I believe.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.684
Hello, Harry.

29:25.518 --> 29:28.749
Are you looking for someone
? Something Special?

29:28.960 --> 29:31.000
Okay.

29:31.213 --> 29:35.314
It has followed me all day
Now you have a chance..

29:36.720 --> 29:37.924
I did what?

29:37.926 --> 29:38.969
What do you want?

29:39.724 --> 29:40.525
You know what.

29:41.684 --> 29:43.977
I wonder
about my sister.

29:44.813 --> 29:47.106
I could not help
David. Know it.

29:47.421 --> 29:52.727
<P> Dorothy
had no reason to be there. She was a secretary.

29:52.949 --> 29:54.720
You used it as cover.

29:54.722 --> 29:57.014
You are wrong, as usual
.

29:57.433 --> 30:01.697
Not when told not to marry
you. It is sloppy with people, Harry.

30:03.378 --> 30:05.045
Dave!

30:08.426 --> 30:10.049
Harry

30:12.598 --> 30:16.727
It is with the sun on his back
Eckert wanted checasse you

30:16.937 --> 30:19.544
to see if it is ready
back

30:19.545 --> 30:21.933
working
and mentally strong.

30:24.697 --> 30:26.635
You can not blame me for suspecting

30:26.678 --> 30:29.764
If I wanted to kill him,
think they would have let me see?

30:30.808 --> 30:36.219
It could be with my sister and the rest
of Hannan!

31:22.165 --> 31:25.041
Goodbye, Harry.

31:31.343 --> 31:32.863
Kill him.

32:19.424 --> 32:24.588
<P> No, wait, let me explain
! Please do not shoot!

32:25.056 --> 32:27.098
I'll blow your brains out!

32:27.204 --> 32:28.767
I can not breathe!

32:30.438 --> 32:31.896
Why
was sitting in the dark?

32:31.898 --> 32:33.241
I was scared!

32:33.764 --> 32:37.310
<? P> - What were you doing
- I turned off the lights

32:38.781 --> 32:39.402
Why did not you leave?

32:39.616 --> 32:42.096
Pay rent and
have a right to be!

32:43.663 --> 32:46.540
You have no right.

32:46.541 --> 32:48.314
He said to disappear.

32:48.836 --> 32:51.915
I do not care!
Stop yelling at me!

32:53.216 --> 32:56.720
You gave me a horrible
later today. In the lab

32:56.721 --> 33:01.620
spoke of death threats, his hands trembled
as if struck by catatonia

33:01.623 --> 33:03.281
and poured the liquid
What was that ?

33:03.291 --> 33:09.020
<P> Do not know if it would
police or the police would not.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.894
I think we should call the police
.

33:11.427 --> 33:15.659
To say what? What
receive threats in Hebrew?

33:16.016 --> 33:17.786
Aramaic!

33:19.249 --> 33:20.184
Mr Hannan!

33:20.605 --> 33:26.645
Would you take a constructive suggestion
I have a friend who can help you?.

33:26.654 --> 33:28.212
I consulted a rabbi.

33:28.323 --> 33:33.307
Richard Peabody is not a rabbi
He is Princeton.. Professor

33:33.308 --> 33:40.411
and teaches theology. Is an expert
in Biblical Hebrew.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.235
I know he can tell you more

33:43.237 --> 33:46.150
about the strange message.
I present you this weekend.

33:46.158 --> 33:47.299
Why do not you go with me?

33:49.182 --> 33:51.677
Hey, I think I owe you an apology
.

33:52.561 --> 33:57.108
<P> This guy thought
was following me, I was not.

33:57.109 --> 34:00.335
And the message is a
sect of crazies who want to go

34:00.342 --> 34:05.131
to place a candle as devotion
Why do not we forget it?

34:05.911 --> 34:07.536
rejects my suggestion?

34:08.790 --> 34:10.659
What do you want?
Traveling 16 miles to talk

34:10.667 --> 34:16.501
with a teacher. What the hell
this? What are you looking for?

34:16.550 --> 34:20.965
Who said I search something?
Think I'm here to have fun?

34:20.972 --> 34:22.859
No doubt we made a mistake
.

34:22.870 --> 34:24.324
One of us committed.

34:26.458 --> 34:31.210
Know that long
have an intense relationship

34:31.422 --> 34:36.002
Princeton
with someone I will not pretend I do not know

34:36.219 --> 34:40.489
<P> improvise sexual adventures.
'm Not hunting for men with problems.

34:40.809 --> 34:42.643
I never thought about it.

34:48.985 --> 34:51.132
But I hear in her voice.

34:53.158 --> 34:55.409
Because I
appearance of being sexually hungry?

35:02.545 --> 35:03.753
Want to go?

35:08.177 --> 35:11.366
Should I go?

35:26.533 --> 35:29.619
I sleep on the couch.

36:21.811 --> 36:22.708
Dorothy.

36:32.136 --> 36:33.868
Kiss Me.

36:41.628 --> 36:42.625
Caution!

36:42.629 --> 36:44.295
Oh, my God!

36:47.051 --> 36:51.701
Mr Hannan! Mr. Hannan!

36:55.812 --> 36:57.226
Dorothy?

36:57.439 --> 36:59.931
No, I'm Ellie.

37:00.151 --> 37:03.460
Ellie, Ellie.

37:10.831 --> 37:13.916
You're sweating. Put it.

37:40.034 --> 37:42.493
Dorothy was his wife?

37:42.704 --> 37:46.016
Yes, yes.

37:47.230 --> 37:48.481
Okay?

37:53.176 --> 37:56.877
I was at a bar in
canteen near El Paso

37:59.851 --> 38:04.687
<P> I expected a guy. A witness
federal, who had located.

38:06.943 --> 38:10.963
Dorothy was in New York
, spending a holiday.

38:13.514 --> 38:15.555
It was snowing there,
so she wanted to come.

38:17.016 --> 38:18.476
I did not try to stop her.

38:22.900 --> 38:27.968
An old man played the violin
next to the canteen. It was late.

38:28.178 --> 38:34.112
Many people. When
was just coffee

38:35.312 --> 38:40.588
The guy I hoped
two days ago appeared

38:41.111 --> 38:43.497
with a couple of friends.

38:45.741 --> 38:49.349
He saw me. Dorothy
saw my reaction.

38:50.956 --> 38:54.041
The friends stuck
hands on jackets.

38:55.128 --> 39:00.290
It all happened so fast
. I pushed the chair.

39:01.073 --> 39:02.385
She started to say something

39:04.932 --> 39:09.583
and then the shooting started
The whole place exploded.

39:12.859 --> 39:14.171
<P> And then they were gone.

39:17.031 --> 39:21.160
I thought I was okay with it
.

39:23.289 --> 39:28.450
She was hot.
Looked a little scared, nothing more.

39:30.589 --> 39:35.751
And she leaned over and
put his arm around her.

39:39.350 --> 39:43.375
Oh! Harry,
she said. Oh! Harry!

39:47.381 --> 39:51.615
I took my arm
He was wet..

39:54.682 --> 40:00.896
Oh! Harry!
She said again.

40:07.093 --> 40:10.179
She came for a holiday.

40:27.431 --> 40:29.888
Maybe better
call a doctor.

40:30.978 --> 40:33.541
No, no.

40:35.358 --> 40:37.809
I have a
substance in the bathroom.

41:19.267 --> 41:22.144
Harry! Harry!

41:39.292 --> 41:40.188
cyanide.

41:46.447 --> 41:50.612
When my father died I was very sick
. The doctor said it was

41:50.828 --> 41:54.992
like he abandoned me. But I loved him.

41:56.147 --> 41:59.691
<P> After I moved in with my grandmother
. It was an amazing person.

42:00.778 --> 42:08.442
With more
strange experiences. She did everything.

42:10.164 --> 42:12.305
My rebellious traits
should come of it.

42:15.150 --> 42:19.485
Yes, I'm serious
Sometimes I feel lost..

42:23.494 --> 42:27.091
Then she became very ill and
changed much.

42:27.144 --> 42:30.019
I would wake up at night and listened to
writhe in pain.

42:31.483 --> 42:33.670
And
felt completely powerless.

42:36.218 --> 42:38.156
Sorry regret.
Not mean to be so morbid.

42:39.764 --> 42:40.448
What?

42:41.495 --> 42:43.162
You did not hear a single word I said
.

42:43.894 --> 42:46.076
I heard every word you said
. Morbid.

42:47.231 --> 42:48.274
Must be a
because of their social circle.

42:48.275 --> 42:51.772
I do not know why I told you
Not even one of my

42:51.779 --> 42:56.671
<P> favorite stories. Hello?

43:07.987 --> 43:10.238
I'll have coffee. Want?

43:10.761 --> 43:12.218
Yes, please. Black.

43:15.037 --> 43:16.172
No need

43:16.185 --> 43:21.085
No, no, no
problem. Come back already.

43:22.130 --> 43:23.066
And sugar.

43:23.068 --> 43:24.830
Ok

44:01.596 --> 44:02.699
I'm sorry, Father.

44:54.266 --> 44:55.576
Hello! Sorry.

44:57.457 --> 44:59.020
Richard Peabody,
Harry Hannan.

45:00.065 --> 45:00.790
Nice to meet you.

45:00.899 --> 45:01.725
Sorry to bother you.

45:01.942 --> 45:06.737
No, no, those words, Goel
Hadam that intrigued me, I'm happy.

45:07.710 --> 45:08.850
I'll leave you alone.

45:08.851 --> 45:09.268
What will you do?

45:09.269 --> 45:10.625
I need to meet
a person.

45:11.673 --> 45:14.483
Harry, you're
for the wine festival?

45:14.484 --> 45:15.527
I have to go back.

45:15.532 --> 45:19.175
<P> I suggest that you do not miss. It is unlike any other
.

45:19.391 --> 45:21.051
Okay.

45:21.060 --> 45:23.656
Well, I'll let them.

45:29.341 --> 45:32.427
She said she has
involvement with someone here?

45:32.846 --> 45:33.984
Indeed.

45:35.912 --> 45:40.448
Do not know. I opposed his
move to New York because

45:41.502 --> 45:46.711
She is very vulnerable,
need advice, protection.

45:47.176 --> 45:48.384
And that's their mission?

45:49.012 --> 45:52.861
Yes, it is. Come to my
office and see what I can do.

45:56.417 --> 46:02.667
It's not very artistic, is not
Goel Hadam, avenging blood?.

46:02.716 --> 46:04.541
I confess my surprise
. From the beginning

46:04.552 --> 46:07.887
Wait, there's more
messages?

46:07.994 --> 46:08.714
So do not tell you?

46:09.350 --> 46:10.383
<P> I am not alone?

46:10.393 --> 46:13.410
No, but its
situation is different.

46:13.411 --> 46:14.141
What is it?

46:15.816 --> 46:17.998
Looks like you're the only one still alive
.

46:27.852 --> 46:31.353
I do not know how they found me
, but the lessons

46:31.565 --> 46:38.864
or congress
clerics or scholars brought him.

46:38.866 --> 46:43.030
I told the truth. In early
not pay attention.

46:43.079 --> 46:45.010
different incidents.

46:45.228 --> 46:47.407
Incidents?

46:47.418 --> 46:49.356
Well, deaths
course.. Sit.

46:50.026 --> 46:50.959
How many were they?

46:51.590 --> 46:57.846
Four, no, five in the last two years
. IIRC it was the first

47:00.768 --> 47:04.203
a certain, Lucksig, Howard Lucksig
an executive of San Francisco.

47:04.252 --> 47:09.101
<P> Participated in a conference in Los Angeles
, they found a wet beach

47:09.112 --> 47:13.488
near a hotel in Malibu
say the victim of a cramp.

47:13.743 --> 47:16.931
His widow found the ticket among his things
three weeks later.

47:18.499 --> 47:19.530
And the second?

47:21.252 --> 47:26.005
A man named Faucon
owner of a nursery in Denver, found

47:26.008 --> 47:31.430
at Lake Mead. Suicide.
Had terminal cancer. Weeks later

47:31.640 --> 47:35.078
I found a note in his safe
Then a man named Morden

47:35.395 --> 47:38.621
Construction materials sold
in Rochester. Was hit.

47:39.045 --> 47:44.253
Meyers Nashville
suffered a heart attack in the pool.

47:44.260 --> 47:50.199
in the last three or four months
Monash  And, drowned in a canoe trip.

47:50.831 --> 47:52.280
Interesting. No weapon.

47:52.437 --> 47:57.811
<P> No, no. Goel
can only be executed following the biblical forms

47:57.819 --> 48:01.050
prescribed in insane act by a former judge, Sanhedrin

48:01.782 --> 48:05.807
by fire, sword,
stoning or strangulation.

48:05.954 --> 48:08.135
Perhaps there
modern methods.

48:08.770 --> 48:10.952
Yes, equivalent to trampling
stoning.

48:11.691 --> 48:16.269
Strangulation
something that affects breathing, choking

48:16.488 --> 48:20.137
water,
tablets seems that water is popular.

48:20.449 --> 48:23.370
What I'm talking about, do not know
these guys, there is no relation!

48:26.396 --> 48:28.689
Does anyone think there
yes, Mr. Hannan.

48:43.334 --> 48:47.984
Monash, Meyers, Morden ,.

48:49.592 --> 48:52.045
Faucon Lucksig, Hannan.

49:18.274 --> 49:21.673
I see
kept his word. I'm happy.

49:23.072 --> 49:25.427
<P> It's wonderful.

49:26.096 --> 49:28.651
The occasion requires.

49:30.373 --> 49:32.623
What's this?

49:32.624 --> 49:34.084
onyx, garnet.

49:34.336 --> 49:37.526
Hematite. See, some
red spots?

49:37.840 --> 49:38.874
Ah, yes!

49:38.986 --> 49:40.134
You see Eve

49:40.135 --> 49:42.177
- Eva
- My grandma...

49:42.951 --> 49:46.703
Richard says I should dress better, more
fix makeup, and other things, but

49:46.705 --> 49:49.406
I only do when I'm in a good mood
.

49:50.982 --> 49:52.230
Why?

49:53.172 --> 49:55.145
For more sherry.

49:59.263 --> 50:01.713
Hannan, I am concerned
I received this message this afternoon..

50:01.766 --> 50:05.582
Someone wants to meet you at
patio at three-thirty in the morning.

50:05.792 --> 50:06.372
Who?

50:06.522 --> 50:11.730
I do not know. Someone called me.
My secretary gave me the message.

50:12.509 --> 50:14.443
<P> You will?

50:14.553 --> 50:16.525
I do not know.

50:17.473 --> 50:20.381
I hope you did not
wasted your time coming here.

50:21.124 --> 50:23.416
Speaking of witch
we have here.!

50:23.460 --> 50:24.357
Richard.

50:30.208 --> 50:31.207
You are a painting.

50:33.337 --> 50:37.987
earrings in red stone
A bit exaggerated.

50:39.178 --> 50:41.215
It's just a tribute to New York
?

50:41.430 --> 50:42.421
It came

50:42.473 --> 50:43.827
I will change.

50:47.313 --> 50:49.982
I have the impression that your friend
Peabody is behind us.

50:50.296 --> 50:51.542
It is possible.

50:52.382 --> 50:54.876
It is his custom to offend and
follow her to her house?

50:59.682 --> 51:02.804
This is the style of Richard
. He is a man

51:02.853 --> 51:06.356
very bright.
Wonderful to me when he wants.

51:07.088 --> 51:08.024
As a punching bag?

51:08.130 --> 51:09.588
<P> None of that.

51:10.319 --> 51:10.944
None of this, huh?

51:11.905 --> 51:15.034
Please leave this
course. It is what I have

51:15.035 --> 51:16.172
I feel happy.

51:17.893 --> 51:19.309
Unbelievable to hear.

51:19.666 --> 51:24.421
I do not get well with
men. I always do something wrong

51:24.422 --> 51:30.046
complex, difficult, as is
do the first dance.

51:30.054 --> 51:33.651
Panic Me. It's like I'm
and I can not do anything.

51:34.121 --> 51:38.918
I do not know what you're talking
, but hear it.

51:39.545 --> 51:46.211
Without your awesome outfit
you are attractive. It's bright, sweet.

51:49.182 --> 51:51.120
Never had a
ad on "personal", right?

51:55.127 --> 51:58.630
I only have a meeting tomorrow morning
. If you want

51:58.631 --> 52:01.439
I can go with you to the patio
.

52:01.447 --> 52:02.876
<P> No. No. It's okay.

52:05.181 --> 52:06.974
Promise me you will be careful.

52:07.643 --> 52:08.434
Sure.

52:11.084 --> 52:12.492
Promise.

52:13.754 --> 52:14.900
I swear my heart.

52:47.171 --> 52:48.275
I like you, Ellie.

52:51.239 --> 52:53.177
You became for me
into something special.

52:57.601 --> 53:03.712
But but I'm not the guy who
must be close by now.

53:10.012 --> 53:12.886
It's not you, it's me.

53:15.613 --> 53:17.760
understood this?

53:20.411 --> 53:21.489
I understand.

53:23.373 --> 53:24.634
Really?

53:24.750 --> 53:29.436
I have to find a small apartment
. You can do it tomorrow?

53:32.196 --> 53:34.030
Yes, I will find one.

53:35.847 --> 53:38.454
See you in New York
, okay?

53:39.289 --> 53:43.105
I will go after tomorrow and
leave your apartment.

53:43.106 --> 53:44.147
No hurry.

53:46.590 --> 53:49.570
<P> Could you give
kitten food and water?

53:51.346 --> 53:52.382
dry food.

53:52.806 --> 53:54.367
dry food.

53:54.370 --> 53:56.244
And Gerald, too.

53:56.456 --> 53:58.330
And Gerald, too?

54:00.524 --> 54:01.249
And the fish.

54:05.561 --> 54:06.766
Say goodnight, Ellie.

54:06.813 --> 54:08.012
Good evening, Ellie.

54:21.727 --> 54:22.622
Richard!

54:26.212 --> 54:28.567
You scare me sometimes
, Ellie.

54:32.866 --> 54:35.534
You scare me much.

55:53.780 --> 55:55.520
Run!

57:44.148 --> 57:45.462
Come on, Harry!

59:03.727 --> 59:04.936
Last chance, Harry.

59:06.918 --> 59:08.274
You lost, Harry.

01:00:38.533 --> 01:00:40.029
Dave!

01:00:58.767 --> 01:01:02.896
It's becoming a problem
are wanting to do.?

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.441
Who are you?

01:01:06.443 --> 01:01:10.613
Sam Urdell. The committee asked me to
follow him after he visited the rabbi.

01:01:11.241 --> 01:01:13.942
<P> But I'm not ready to
these butchers.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:18.112
What committee?
What you're talking about?

01:01:18.646 --> 01:01:23.922
Think all
committees announce the New York Times?

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:30.004
It is a committee like any other
Five Jews were killed by a

01:01:30.223 --> 01:01:33.240
lunatic who writes
messages in Hebrew.

01:01:36.522 --> 01:01:37.834
Did you know?

01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:43.987
He was not behind you. Is not
Goel. When Monash was killed

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:50.446
Your friend Quittle was here. This
was left in the cab of Monash.

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.565
His name is behind.

01:01:59.468 --> 01:02:00.546
What's this?

01:02:00.594 --> 01:02:01.713
A canteen.

01:02:03.014 --> 01:02:06.830
It is a canteen.
Never seen before. What does that mean?

01:02:07.666 --> 01:02:09.627
I do not know. During the war he was picking

01:02:09.628 --> 01:02:11.731
<P> People of Berlin
smuggling grenades

01:02:11.733 --> 01:02:15.794
and since 1947 helped
capture Eichmann, but it

01:02:15.801 --> 01:02:18.922
baffles me. As this enters the canteen
subject.

01:02:19.243 --> 01:02:20.657
Where is she?

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:23.830
Glory Side. Been there 20 times.
Never heard of you.

01:02:26.439 --> 01:02:28.499
I'll check you Urdell.

01:02:28.921 --> 01:02:30.289
So check.

01:02:31.758 --> 01:02:32.688
I will.

01:02:33.636 --> 01:02:35.884
Do this.

01:03:10.682 --> 01:03:15.657
Where can
this place? Where the hell was it?

01:03:16.648 --> 01:03:18.064
So!

01:03:19.777 --> 01:03:20.566
We must go deeper.

01:03:33.813 --> 01:03:34.960
The
the hell are you doing?

01:03:34.963 --> 01:03:36.734
I'm checking.

01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:03.642
Please calm.

01:04:07.316 --> 01:04:08.534
You are crazy.

01:04:09.172 --> 01:04:11.456
Come here. Look at it.

01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:18.443
<P> ZM, ZM. He was also
in messages and on the tombstones.

01:04:18.455 --> 01:04:19.808
What the hell is this?

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:28.663
ZM, ZM. Yes, one
synagogue. A street.

01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:30.968
A house!

01:04:31.846 --> 01:04:35.870
Wait a minute Wait a minute
.

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:37.742
Never been here, but I had.

01:04:39.251 --> 01:04:44.632
ZM. Z is Migdal.
Was the biggest brothel in the Eastern Zone.

01:04:44.675 --> 01:04:45.545
Brothel?

01:04:45.613 --> 01:04:48.011
A moment of reverence
please.

01:04:49.994 --> 01:04:53.487
For 50 years I lost my innocence
here.

01:04:55.626 --> 01:04:56.414
Rabbi Jacobs?

01:04:56.419 --> 01:04:58.607
Yes I help you?

01:04:59.443 --> 01:05:02.351
Am Sam Urdell
and this is Mr. Hannan.

01:05:04.179 --> 01:05:07.990
- How will
- Calls consult our library?

01:05:07.996 --> 01:05:09.871
Yes, exactly.

01:05:39.327 --> 01:05:40.743
Bingo!

01:05:48.818 --> 01:05:54.929
<P> Sam, Sam! Max Hannan!
Secretary of Z Migdal.

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:00.038
I knew my grandfather had
a property

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.909
but had no idea who served with
brothel.

01:06:02.335 --> 01:06:05.868
A? There were at least 20 or 30
brothels. These houses were

01:06:05.881 --> 01:06:09.315
good deal at the time
Hearst owned several.

01:06:09.323 --> 01:06:14.843
Everybody involved. Protestants,
Italians, Jews, everyone

01:06:15.476 --> 01:06:16.829
Max and Hannan.

01:06:16.832 --> 01:06:21.831
This.
But was expelled from his community. Who would sit

01:06:21.838 --> 01:06:25.270
at the synagogue next to a brothel owner
to? Formed their organization

01:06:25.906 --> 01:06:33.477
Cool named Zvi Migdal
Great Powers. Similar appearance

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.537
any society.
Had the intention to help its members. Kept

01:06:36.544 --> 01:06:42.065
<P> cemeteries, churches etc. But its real purpose was
circumvent the law.

01:06:42.489 --> 01:06:45.191
Operating brothels and
import girls.

01:06:46.244 --> 01:06:49.638
When I think
sat on his lap when the bastard child.

01:06:49.936 --> 01:06:51.561
has a weird sense of humor.

01:06:53.128 --> 01:06:55.101
The
white slavery is in my roots!

01:06:57.091 --> 01:07:00.004
You men of the Government,
believe that the most important

01:07:00.011 --> 01:07:05.533
is to be on the cover of Times
Damn.! And the private wars?

01:07:05.539 --> 01:07:09.706
And vendettas that
people are mulling over their heads.

01:07:09.915 --> 01:07:10.854
What do you think of the time?

01:07:12.256 --> 01:07:13.568
Ok, Sam, okay.

01:07:14.863 --> 01:07:19.712
How about Morden, Monash, Lucksig, Meyers
such these guys?

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:21.807
Ok, ok, ok.

01:08:31.417 --> 01:08:32.729
I thought I had fallen completely
.

01:08:36.631 --> 01:08:37.216
<P> Look, Eva

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:45.559
You're a nice,
but better go now girl.

01:08:47.897 --> 01:08:48.791
What a calamity of man!

01:08:50.567 --> 01:08:55.986
No, no. Not so. My wife
realize if I do not return.

01:09:02.707 --> 01:09:07.868
We were a long time in the bar
We drank a bit, was not it.?

01:09:08.652 --> 01:09:13.094
Listen, Bernie, would you
to embrace a little.

01:09:14.179 --> 01:09:16.952
Learn to know him
first.

01:09:21.479 --> 01:09:23.210
But it may be
as you say.

01:09:35.352 --> 01:09:37.081
Eva, you do not want to stay?

01:09:39.211 --> 01:09:41.880
Do not want to have it on my conscience
.

01:09:47.345 --> 01:09:49.077
Stay.

01:09:51.935 --> 01:09:52.934
Are you sure?

01:09:55.064 --> 01:09:56.168
Know what I think?

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:03.155
I think you're scared little
Bernie Meckler.

01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:05.650
- There
- Yes I think you're scared.

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:08.570
<P> His wife is out of town
?

01:10:09.457 --> 01:10:10.352
Stay.

01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:16.395
I know what you really want. Hum, hum
. Will not you tell me? Tell me.

01:10:16.758 --> 01:10:19.113
Eva, where are you going?

01:10:20.054 --> 01:10:23.076
Eva
Where are you going, where you going?

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.203
I will take a shower and freshen
me a bit.

01:10:26.875 --> 01:10:30.265
But I, I thought
talked to relax.

01:10:31.631 --> 01:10:34.444
Let's Eve, what do you think?

01:10:34.488 --> 01:10:36.322
All in good time.

01:10:39.495 --> 01:10:40.598
Oh!

01:10:42.582 --> 01:10:45.287
Love.

01:10:58.477 --> 01:11:02.806
There are not enough
the earrings I gave you?

01:11:02.816 --> 01:11:04.768
Not

01:11:05.402 --> 01:11:07.192
Not?

01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:09.591
Be quiet.

01:11:09.595 --> 01:11:11.047
Wait for me upstairs.

01:11:13.454 --> 01:11:15.613
You said.

01:11:30.392 --> 01:11:37.336
Delicious. Give me a kiss.

01:11:47.079 --> 01:11:50.060
Very good. Like this.

01:11:57.301 --> 01:11:59.445
<P> Calm down.
Can not float.

01:13:01.548 --> 01:13:02.651
Is there anyone at home?

01:13:09.162 --> 01:13:11.099
Where is the fabulous Miss
. Fabian?

01:13:14.064 --> 01:13:15.376
With the compliments of the house.

01:13:16.838 --> 01:13:17.357
This is for what?

01:13:17.672 --> 01:13:20.173
For you. And this too.

01:13:21.531 --> 01:13:24.344
It should.
'm Doing cleaning.

01:13:28.248 --> 01:13:29.326
Doing?

01:13:31.794 --> 01:13:32.795
What's going on?

01:13:33.421 --> 01:13:35.505
I'm leaving
space you need.

01:13:38.991 --> 01:13:40.508
No, it will not.

01:13:41.556 --> 01:13:43.217
Seriously. It's time.

01:13:44.581 --> 01:13:45.280
Why?

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:48.223
I do not know.
'm Afraid of what might happen if I stay.

01:13:49.274 --> 01:13:51.873
I'm not afraid if
to stay. I can cope.

01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:55.104
I need to clarify
things with Richard.

01:14:01.623 --> 01:14:03.352
<P> You must set the
things to me first.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:12.000
Listen. Did much for me.
Because I can not do anything for you?

01:14:12.011 --> 01:14:12.948
We tried.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.172
That was before.

01:14:16.392 --> 01:14:19.100
And this is now.

01:14:20.918 --> 01:14:21.709
What are you doing?

01:14:29.888 --> 01:14:31.201
Stop.

01:14:35.937 --> 01:14:36.623
Please.

01:14:44.385 --> 01:14:46.532
Stop.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.741
Let's get out of here soon.

01:15:22.203 --> 01:15:23.661
Where to?

01:15:26.313 --> 01:15:27.105
No matter.

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:30.121
Not

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:34.091
Only Harry and Ellie.

01:15:44.252 --> 01:15:45.145
Hello?

01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:46.806
Harry, I'm Sam.

01:15:47.443 --> 01:15:48.275
What is it, Sam?

01:15:48.695 --> 01:15:52.859
Killed a guy named Meckler,
Niagara Falls, Meckler.

01:15:53.701 --> 01:15:57.935
Meet Me at the home of Rabbi Jacobs
tomorrow at nine. Let's find

01:15:57.977 --> 01:16:04.229
<P> something that interests us, I hope.
I fear for you, Harry.

01:16:05.487 --> 01:16:06.209
Do not worry.

01:16:18.670 --> 01:16:22.589
Ellie, what's wrong?

01:16:23.676 --> 01:16:28.525
The only clue the police have is a
Aramaic message triptych style

01:16:30.205 --> 01:16:31.663
with the ZM inicais.

01:16:31.916 --> 01:16:37.505
It seems that the police are looking for a prostitute
with the initials ZM.

01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:40.833
That's all for now. The body is at the morgue
and research

01:16:40.844 --> 01:16:44.695
continues. I'm Gary Gunner,
4 News, Niagara Falls.

01:16:45.474 --> 01:16:51.689
It seems that the main
Goel killed a descendant of each ZM family except

01:16:51.691 --> 01:16:52.525
Meckler.

01:16:52.839 --> 01:16:56.072
Hey, you're good at guessing.

01:16:57.281 --> 01:17:02.653

Wow, unfortunately
volume was borrowed in the past months.

01:17:15.637 --> 01:17:17.262
You can find out for whom?

01:17:17.369 --> 01:17:21.571
Sure.
Firestone Library at Princeton University.

01:17:21.582 --> 01:17:22.936

Yes, Reading Room 629.

01:17:31.282 --> 01:17:32.740
But I do not know if there
someone up there!

01:17:37.999 --> 01:17:38.572
Keep an eye on Peabody.

01:17:38.896 --> 01:17:40.101
You can leave.

01:19:34.082 --> 01:19:35.707
Professor Peabody
Teacher!

01:19:38.358 --> 01:19:39.670
The book ordered arrived.

01:19:59.426 --> 01:20:01.259
TRAFFICKING OF
WHITE SLAVERY

01:20:09.334 --> 01:20:12.419
THE JEWS OF NEW ENGLAND

01:20:55.746 --> 01:20:57.267
Wait a
moment, please!

01:21:03.047 --> 01:21:04.752
Sorry.

01:21:42.055 --> 01:21:44.725
Ellie.

01:21:46.852 --> 01:21:49.522
627, 628

01:21:52.797 --> 01:21:55.882
Hannan! Hannan!

01:21:58.325 --> 01:21:59.952
Hannan!

01:22:04.583 --> 01:22:05.373
<P> Can I help you?

01:22:05.793 --> 01:22:06.616
Looking for someone.

01:22:06.627 --> 01:22:07.765
Who?

01:22:12.301 --> 01:22:14.343
You Peabody, is not it?

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:17.156
I know Him?

01:22:17.891 --> 01:22:18.923
I am a friend of Hannan.

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:25.706
I understand. I did not know Mr.
Hannan was in town.

01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.118
man full of surprises!

01:22:54.646 --> 01:22:56.688
God, you scared me!

01:22:56.794 --> 01:22:58.769
It was the same? Sorry.

01:22:59.610 --> 01:23:00.190
Something wrong?

01:23:00.236 --> 01:23:05.131
Why do not you do not
wearing? Let's start the journey.

01:23:07.745 --> 01:23:09.093
Only Harry and Ellie?

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.283
Only Harry and Ellie.

01:23:16.548 --> 01:23:19.112
It will not answer the phone?

01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:22.345
Wipe up
not waste time.

01:23:24.536 --> 01:23:26.831
Operator? Operator?

01:23:28.855 --> 01:23:30.784
Operator? Operator
Call me with the police.

01:23:34.279 --> 01:23:36.112
<P> Where are we going?

01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:40.284
Trust me.

01:24:44.784 --> 01:24:45.966
Relax.

01:24:45.973 --> 01:24:47.338
I am relaxed.

01:24:49.581 --> 01:24:51.311
Calm down.

01:24:51.313 --> 01:24:57.042
Tell me more about Eva,
his grandmother, the mother of her father.

01:24:57.049 --> 01:25:00.692
It was created as the daughter of his
grandfather who gave her the earrings.

01:25:00.804 --> 01:25:03.298
Who
you lived as a child.

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:05.286
Because you know what?

01:25:10.232 --> 01:25:12.066
Well?

01:25:13.778 --> 01:25:16.854
Now there Harry.
Not going to talk, just drive.

01:25:42.564 --> 01:25:44.085
Why are you doing this?

01:25:51.325 --> 01:25:53.469
I must be okay, right?

01:25:54.225 --> 01:25:55.871
But there's nobody here.

01:26:02.068 --> 01:26:03.981
You are.

01:27:00.057 --> 01:27:03.247
Harry!
Not stop at red lights!

01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:04.600
I did this?

01:27:06.002 --> 01:27:07.627
There's something wrong, Harry?

01:27:08.985 --> 01:27:12.696
<P> It's family, Ellie
? It's familiar?

01:27:12.886 --> 01:27:15.241
Harry! Harry!

01:27:16.432 --> 01:27:18.241
Stop the car!

01:27:20.953 --> 01:27:21.892
Caution!

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:51.508
I love you, Harry! Love you!

01:29:12.306 --> 01:29:14.557
He placed among Diurilen
, was not it?

01:29:17.417 --> 01:29:19.042
No, I love you.

01:29:19.607 --> 01:29:22.999
Me?
'm Just one to the list.

01:29:24.718 --> 01:29:28.326
He returned home to
kill me. I was looking for

01:29:28.368 --> 01:29:31.343
Like Meckler, Monash
and all others.

01:29:38.277 --> 01:29:42.406
Do not you see, Harry?
A poor girl, who lived in Europe.

01:29:42.407 --> 01:29:46.467
And where an attractive stranger
promises to marry her in

01:29:46.474 --> 01:29:51.160
America, where the streets are gold
. Flights paid for

01:29:51.585 --> 01:29:53.460
Ellis Island. Where is weird
? Do not worry

01:29:53.671 --> 01:29:58.878
another strange tells you where
stay. Lock her in a room

01:30:00.346 --> 01:30:06.385
<P> and the men arrive and
have sex, sex, sex!

01:30:06.854 --> 01:30:12.212
And make her his whore! Has
15 years! Your fate is sealed.

01:30:12.903 --> 01:30:17.546
His brain was
destroyed by syphilis.

01:30:18.118 --> 01:30:19.326
You're a killer!

01:30:19.578 --> 01:30:23.389
His grandfather was too, but
is dead. Who will punish him?

01:30:23.437 --> 01:30:25.472
Want to punish him through
me, is not it?

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:31.946
I'll take it back
, Ellie.

01:31:28.206 --> 01:31:29.103
Ellie!

01:32:15.766 --> 01:32:19.686
Now you will see how to transform
water into electricity.

01:32:20.146 --> 01:32:22.711
Come on. We still
many places to see.

01:32:25.883 --> 01:32:30.220
On his left
admire a painting of Thomas Benton showing

01:32:30.221 --> 01:32:31.570
discovery of Niagara Falls.

01:32:35.582 --> 01:32:36.687
Everyone walking.

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:39.211
Come on, Mr. and Mrs. Ross..

01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:43.848
<P> Ellie!

01:33:43.855 --> 01:33:49.862
<? P> - Okay guys, some question
- It is true that cataracts

01:33:49.905 --> 01:33:53.339
have high
falls over the world?

01:35:11.611 --> 01:35:15.842
Do not commit indiscretions
and have no problem.

01:35:21.624 --> 01:35:25.440
The
cataracts are wonderful.

01:35:26.004 --> 01:35:28.965
millions and millions of bubbles
liters of water in minutes.

01:35:29.383 --> 01:35:34.513
We will go through very dangerous place
side of the falls.

01:35:34.932 --> 01:35:36.385
Therefore, we will use
slickers.
