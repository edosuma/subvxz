00:33.426 --> 00:35.394
First of all,
I want to apologize...

00:35.462 --> 00:37.657
for being out of touch so long.

00:37.730 --> 00:41.928
These last few years of my life
been real fucked up...

00:42.001 --> 00:44.970
but you probably
already know that by now.

00:45.038 --> 00:47.563
See me fuckin' with you?

00:47.640 --> 00:49.665
I lost almost everything.

00:50.944 --> 00:52.673
Anyway, I'm sorry I left.

00:52.745 --> 00:56.681
For what it's worth,
I think about you every day.

00:56.749 --> 00:59.775
All I want to do is see you die.

00:59.853 --> 01:02.720
You can understand that, right?

01:02.789 --> 01:05.019
But here's the best part...

01:05.090 --> 01:07.059
so pay attention...

01:07.127 --> 01:09.254
'cause if you're readin' this...

01:09.329 --> 01:12.264
it can only mean one thing...

01:12.332 --> 01:14.027
I'm out.

01:18.071 --> 01:20.596
Those of y'all didn't see
"State Property l"...

01:20.673 --> 01:22.140
let me run it down to you.

01:22.208 --> 01:25.143
I put together
this mean-ass squad in Philly...

01:25.211 --> 01:27.543
took over
the whole fuckin' city.

01:27.614 --> 01:30.879
And I bumped heads
with this fuckin' Dame nigga.

01:30.950 --> 01:33.646
This fuckin' nigga
kidnaps my bitch...

01:33.720 --> 01:36.450
then shoots her girlfriend
in the fuckin' head.

01:36.523 --> 01:39.356
So, you know,
we went the fuck to war.

01:39.425 --> 01:41.325
Man, we shot up everything.

01:41.394 --> 01:44.659
Then I get booked
for attempted fuckin' murder.

01:44.731 --> 01:46.528
So you know what I did...

01:46.599 --> 01:48.726
Yeah, I shot up
the whole fuckin' courtroom.

01:48.801 --> 01:50.564
But I don't know
who this chick is...

01:50.637 --> 01:52.901
shot me in the back
of my fuckin' head.

01:52.972 --> 01:54.234
Nah, I'm bullshittin', man.

01:54.307 --> 01:57.504
This is what really went down.

01:57.577 --> 01:59.477
As y'all can see, they got me.

01:59.546 --> 02:01.309
Man, I'm booked.

02:01.381 --> 02:03.781
So let me tell you
how shit went down.

02:03.850 --> 02:05.750
Man, it was about...

02:05.818 --> 02:08.217
Damn, it was that fuckin' long?

02:09.455 --> 02:11.116
Fuck it. Anyway, listen...

02:12.725 --> 02:15.626
I was asleep
when they came for me.

02:15.695 --> 02:17.390
You know how them boys play.

02:17.463 --> 02:20.660
They come kick in your door,
5:00, 6:00 in the morning...

02:20.733 --> 02:23.395
all crazy.

02:23.469 --> 02:27.200
Me, my wife, my daughter...
we was all knocked out.

02:27.273 --> 02:28.570
Come on! Get down!

02:28.641 --> 02:30.199
Come on! Show me your hands!

02:30.276 --> 02:32.540
Get the fuck
out of that bed! Get up!

02:32.612 --> 02:34.239
Hey! Come on, man!

02:34.314 --> 02:35.281
Show me your hands!

02:35.348 --> 02:36.406
Hey, I'll show 'em!

02:36.482 --> 02:38.848
Hey! Yo, get... Aah!

02:38.918 --> 02:40.385
Get down! Show me your hands!

02:40.453 --> 02:41.920
Get him behind!

02:41.988 --> 02:43.979
You know what? Stop.

02:44.057 --> 02:45.888
See, if I'm gonna tell you
this story...

02:46.125 --> 02:48.992
I might as well tell it to you
from the very beginning...

02:49.062 --> 02:51.223
just so y'all get to know me
a little better.

02:52.765 --> 02:54.528
Punk!

02:54.601 --> 02:58.037
I wasn't your average little
happy schoolboy growing up.

02:58.104 --> 02:59.366
You think you nuts,
takin' my stuff?

02:59.439 --> 03:00.406
Give me my money!

03:12.452 --> 03:14.044
Before I was Beans...

03:14.120 --> 03:16.384
the so-called ringleader
of the ABM...

03:16.456 --> 03:17.923
man, I was just Beans...

03:17.991 --> 03:20.619
your average bad-ass
11-year-old...

03:20.693 --> 03:23.218
runnin' around the streets
of Philly with my homeys.

03:25.298 --> 03:27.459
There was four of us...

03:27.533 --> 03:31.993
P-Nut, Baby Boy, D-Nice...

03:32.071 --> 03:34.972
and me...
all day, every day...

03:35.041 --> 03:37.976
pickin' fights,
pickin' pockets...

03:38.044 --> 03:39.568
used to hop the train...

03:39.646 --> 03:41.614
roll on people
for their lunch money...

03:41.681 --> 03:44.115
stick up corner stores
with cap guns.

03:44.183 --> 03:46.413
Shit, you know,
anything to get in trouble.

03:46.486 --> 03:48.454
Shit, that's how we had fun.

03:52.425 --> 03:54.120
Hey, come here!

03:54.193 --> 03:57.685
Man, for me, an unlocked door
was always an invitation.

03:57.764 --> 03:59.163
When I was a kid...

03:59.232 --> 04:01.928
you know, I never
got into any real shit...

04:02.001 --> 04:03.832
till one day...

04:14.180 --> 04:16.579
Oh, shit. I found some weed.

04:16.649 --> 04:17.911
- Where? Where?
- Take it!

04:17.983 --> 04:18.951
What?

04:19.017 --> 04:20.144
What we gonna do with it?

04:20.219 --> 04:21.810
Fill your pockets, Gs!

04:21.887 --> 04:24.789
Put the bags anywhere!
Come on!

04:30.563 --> 04:32.463
Oh!

04:32.532 --> 04:34.261
Look what we have here...

04:34.334 --> 04:35.801
a bunch of
young punk motherfuckers...

04:35.868 --> 04:37.130
tryin' to steal from me.

04:37.203 --> 04:39.262
Y'all niggas think y'all men?

04:39.339 --> 04:41.864
Y'all niggas think that y'all
can come here and take my weed?

04:41.941 --> 04:44.535
Now, what should I do to you
little greasy ass niggas?

04:46.546 --> 04:48.514
Should I kick your ass?

04:48.581 --> 04:50.947
Or should I make you
get down or lay down?

04:51.017 --> 04:53.383
Come here, little nigga.

04:55.588 --> 04:56.748
Come here.

04:59.325 --> 05:01.657
You know what this is?
You come in here...

05:01.728 --> 05:03.559
and try to take my weed,
little nigga?

05:03.629 --> 05:04.891
I'm gonna make
an example out of y'all.

05:04.964 --> 05:06.625
I think I should kick
your ass...

05:06.699 --> 05:08.360
and then make you
get down or lay down.

05:08.434 --> 05:09.867
See what I'm sayin',
little nigga?

05:09.936 --> 05:11.460
You hear me?

05:14.874 --> 05:17.968
I didn't choose to be
in this game.

05:18.044 --> 05:20.672
The game chose me.

05:20.747 --> 05:23.841
My first body...
Shit, I was turned out.

05:24.684 --> 05:27.551
From that day on,
it was get down or lay down.

05:27.653 --> 05:30.121
So I grew up,
got into the drug game.

05:30.189 --> 05:31.247
Before you knew it...

05:31.324 --> 05:34.088
I was the number one
street nigga in Philly...

05:34.160 --> 05:37.823
but then my team got reckless,
and I got booked.

05:37.897 --> 05:39.592
They ain't
only locked me up...

05:39.665 --> 05:42.099
man, they booked me
the fuck up something crazy...

05:42.168 --> 05:44.363
right in front of my wife
and my daughter.

05:44.437 --> 05:46.029
But you know how the feds play.

05:46.105 --> 05:47.436
They do what the fuck they want.

05:47.507 --> 05:49.941
I'm fuckin' callin' my lawyer!
I swear to God!

05:50.009 --> 05:52.273
They had me
for attempted Murder One...

05:52.345 --> 05:55.314
four counts of traffic,
and plus a parole violation.

05:55.381 --> 05:57.008
I know they couldn't hold me
on the weight...

05:57.083 --> 05:58.710
'cause I never touched shit...

05:58.785 --> 06:01.913
but attempted murder
on parole with two priors...

06:01.988 --> 06:03.979
How they say it?
"Fuhgedaboutit."

06:04.056 --> 06:06.923
I'm on trial for my life.
Shit was real.

06:06.993 --> 06:10.622
My whole future
was on the line...

06:10.696 --> 06:12.129
and it was
all in the hands...

06:12.198 --> 06:15.190
of this one nut-ass nigga...
C-Zer.

06:16.402 --> 06:17.994
C-Zer had this little front.

06:18.070 --> 06:20.061
He ran a chop shop
around the way...

06:20.139 --> 06:22.107
made his money
off of running keys...

06:22.175 --> 06:24.234
for that Dame nigga,
and, as you know...

06:24.310 --> 06:26.540
everything Dame had,
I was takin'.

06:26.612 --> 06:27.806
What's up, C-Zer?

06:27.880 --> 06:30.713
So I made C-Zer an offer.

06:30.783 --> 06:32.216
Remember I asked you, uh...

06:32.285 --> 06:34.378
was you gonna
get down or lay down?

06:34.454 --> 06:35.546
He refused.

06:35.621 --> 06:37.282
I'm not tryin' to get down.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.618
But I insisted.

06:38.691 --> 06:40.386
Well, lay down, C-Zer.

06:41.461 --> 06:43.861
About five times.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.433
Unfortunately for C-Zer,
he lived.

06:49.502 --> 06:51.402
Hard-head motherfucker.

06:51.471 --> 06:53.268
Shit,
but we took care of it, though.

06:54.474 --> 06:55.736
On the night before the trial...

06:55.808 --> 06:58.641
I sent Baby Boy and D-Nice
up to C-Zer's mom's crib.

06:58.711 --> 07:00.576
We ain't got no sympathy
for you, old lady.

07:00.646 --> 07:01.738
You could stop cryin'.

07:01.814 --> 07:03.873
They showed her flicks
of the whole family...

07:03.950 --> 07:05.542
addresses and all...

07:05.618 --> 07:08.587
told her if her son
testified against me...

07:08.654 --> 07:10.747
they was gonna tie her up
and make her...

07:10.823 --> 07:13.849
watch them execute
their whole fuckin' family.

07:13.926 --> 07:15.791
Call him! Get him
on the phone right now!

07:15.862 --> 07:18.660
Shit, I don't know how
Baby Boy got them flicks...

07:18.731 --> 07:21.723
but that old lady was shook.

07:21.801 --> 07:23.860
That's all it took.

07:25.371 --> 07:26.929
Dial it faster!

07:27.006 --> 07:29.031
Can you identify the person...

07:29.108 --> 07:32.043
who shot you five times
at point blank range?

07:32.111 --> 07:34.204
Man, when the state wants you...

07:34.280 --> 07:36.407
they play dirty!

07:37.750 --> 07:40.548
Shit, I was tryin'
to be focused up.

07:40.620 --> 07:43.350
Then they hit me
with this Spanish Fly...

07:43.422 --> 07:47.017
this crazy-ass,
super-sexy-ass D.A.

07:47.093 --> 07:49.994
I mean, this bitch was bad!

07:50.062 --> 07:53.088
I ain't gonna lie.
I was open.

07:53.165 --> 07:55.861
Shit, I was damn near ready
to convict myself.

07:57.270 --> 07:59.329
Do you recognize
that man over there?

07:59.405 --> 08:01.396
No, I'm fuckin with y'all, man.
I was focused.

08:01.474 --> 08:03.305
Fuck that.
My life was on the line.

08:03.376 --> 08:04.775
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

08:04.844 --> 08:07.005
Do you recognize him? Please.

08:08.447 --> 08:10.005
No, ma'am.

08:10.082 --> 08:11.140
What?

08:13.753 --> 08:16.051
Let's have some quiet
in the courtroom now.

08:16.122 --> 08:17.146
Order here!

08:17.223 --> 08:18.520
Your Honor, this man
has perjured himself...

08:18.591 --> 08:19.717
in front of the jury.

08:19.792 --> 08:20.918
Counselor, order!

08:20.993 --> 08:22.358
You cannot allow this!
He's lying!

08:22.428 --> 08:23.656
That's enough, Counselor!
Order!

08:23.729 --> 08:25.026
Do you recognize that man?

08:25.097 --> 08:26.428
That's enough.

08:38.811 --> 08:40.745
Answer me.

08:40.813 --> 08:42.780
Do you recognize this man?

08:42.847 --> 08:45.009
Do you know him?

08:48.287 --> 08:50.346
I've never seen him
before in my life.

08:52.892 --> 08:56.225
Order! Let's have some quiet
in the courtroom now!

08:58.764 --> 09:03.201
Yeah. We got to him early.

09:03.269 --> 09:05.134
Unbelievable.

09:05.204 --> 09:08.071
This is unbelievable.
What are we gonna do?

09:08.140 --> 09:12.133
Man, after two weeks of
bullshit evidence and sidebars,

09:12.211 --> 09:13.644
they finally made
their decision.

09:13.713 --> 09:15.442
Will the defendant please rise?

09:15.514 --> 09:17.243
I was a little nervous.

09:17.316 --> 09:19.045
We went head-up
with the judge...

09:19.118 --> 09:20.642
but then, after C-Zer cracked...

09:20.720 --> 09:22.585
I knew I had this thing on lock.

09:22.655 --> 09:25.920
I hereby sentence you
to not less than 15...

09:25.992 --> 09:28.961
nor more than 30 years at
the state correctional facility.

09:29.028 --> 09:30.188
But you know what?

09:30.262 --> 09:31.752
Man, he still pinned
the weight on me.

09:31.831 --> 09:33.924
And, being a repeat offender...

09:34.000 --> 09:36.764
man, the judge put me
under the jail.

09:36.836 --> 09:38.804
Miss, please.

09:38.871 --> 09:40.634
Perry put in an appeal
for me...

09:40.706 --> 09:42.901
but, man,
that shit ain't look good.

09:42.975 --> 09:46.001
And that was it. Game over.

09:52.618 --> 09:55.314
In jail, you meet all kinds
of motherfuckers.

09:55.388 --> 09:57.322
You can always tell
who done time...

09:57.390 --> 09:59.585
by the look on their face.

09:59.659 --> 10:01.388
Check out the white boy
right here.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.052
He's definitely shook.

10:03.129 --> 10:04.721
He's probably
a college dropout...

10:04.797 --> 10:06.958
booked for credit cards
or something.

10:07.033 --> 10:09.934
Now, this dude right here...
definitely a pedophile.

10:10.002 --> 10:12.527
Rapist-face-lookin'
motherfucker.

10:12.605 --> 10:15.972
Here you got your car thief,
retail theft-ass nigga.

10:16.042 --> 10:18.340
He can't stay out of Walgreen's.

10:18.411 --> 10:20.379
He's probably down
for domestics...

10:20.446 --> 10:22.414
or child support or some shit.

10:22.481 --> 10:24.449
Look at him.

10:24.517 --> 10:27.008
Him... he's too tough already.

10:27.086 --> 10:30.249
You can tell this is
his first time being in jail.

10:30.322 --> 10:31.914
Now, this dude right here...

10:31.991 --> 10:34.050
he definitely
been in jail before.

10:34.126 --> 10:36.822
He look like he's just waiting
for commissary.

10:36.896 --> 10:38.591
See, the thing is...

10:38.664 --> 10:41.030
it don't matter if
you're a cold-blooded killer...

10:41.100 --> 10:45.298
if you're a kingpin,
small-time hustler, car thief.

10:45.371 --> 10:47.271
Once they put
them shackles on you...

10:47.339 --> 10:48.829
and they close that gate...

10:48.908 --> 10:50.432
you ain't nothin' but a number.

10:50.509 --> 10:52.033
Man, you're state property.

11:05.725 --> 11:07.852
- Man, what up? Holler at me.
- Let's go.

11:10.563 --> 11:12.155
This is it.

11:14.567 --> 11:16.467
All right, come on.

11:37.690 --> 11:39.282
I'm Free.

11:42.862 --> 11:44.124
You free?

11:44.196 --> 11:48.428
Nah, that's my name... Free.

11:49.935 --> 11:51.869
Philadelphia Freeway.

11:51.937 --> 11:53.996
How did I get where I'm at?

11:54.073 --> 11:56.871
I was runnin'
with this cat from Miami.

11:56.942 --> 11:59.137
It was lovely...

11:59.211 --> 12:01.805
till someone ratted him out.

12:01.881 --> 12:03.405
Police! Freeze!

12:03.482 --> 12:05.473
We both took the fall.

12:05.551 --> 12:07.610
You! Stop right there!

12:32.978 --> 12:36.675
Yeah, what up, Free? Beans.

12:36.749 --> 12:38.808
Salaam alekum.

12:38.884 --> 12:41.546
Heh. Walekum a salaam.

12:41.620 --> 12:45.056
A lot of niggas find Mohammed
when they get locked down.

12:45.124 --> 12:47.092
They get out,
rock a suit and a bowtie...

12:47.159 --> 12:49.150
sling a couple of bean pies...

12:49.228 --> 12:52.061
spark a "L"
and forget all about that shit.

12:52.131 --> 12:55.294
See, but Free, he was
one of those real Muslims.

12:55.367 --> 12:57.267
Welcome, my kin.

12:59.004 --> 13:01.336
Welcome to what?

13:01.407 --> 13:02.874
This shit hole?

13:02.942 --> 13:04.671
Mashallah.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.176
Say what?

13:06.245 --> 13:09.442
Shit house, mansion...

13:09.515 --> 13:11.312
it's whatever you make it,
a'ight?

13:13.919 --> 13:15.352
Yeah, whatever, man.

13:15.421 --> 13:17.753
Free never talked much,
but when he did...

13:17.823 --> 13:19.984
it was always something deep.

13:20.059 --> 13:23.654
I admit, I kind of liked
this nigga from the jump.

13:23.729 --> 13:26.960
But in jail,
you can't trust nobody...

13:27.032 --> 13:28.499
no matter what.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.194
For example...

13:30.269 --> 13:32.533
there was this one nigga
here for life.

13:32.605 --> 13:35.233
Everybody called him
"The Fist"...

13:35.307 --> 13:38.003
big, black, ugly-ass nigga...

13:38.077 --> 13:39.476
nothin' to lose.

13:39.545 --> 13:42.912
I mean, every day,
this nigga was on some shit.

13:42.982 --> 13:45.473
He ain't give a fuck
if he knew you or not...

13:45.551 --> 13:47.018
but once a day...

13:47.086 --> 13:48.815
this motherfucker
would pick out somebody.

13:50.890 --> 13:53.017
I mean, this nigga in for life.

13:53.092 --> 13:54.582
I guess he had to vent.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.855
Heh. It was kind of funny to me.

13:56.929 --> 13:58.328
Broad Street Bully.

13:58.397 --> 14:00.490
Nut, what's up, nigga?!

14:00.566 --> 14:02.500
- What's goin' on?
- What up?

14:02.568 --> 14:06.265
Inside, you never really know
what's what or who's who.

14:06.338 --> 14:08.829
The only thing you come
to jail with is your rep...

14:08.908 --> 14:11.741
and everybody knew my rep
from the street.

14:11.810 --> 14:15.109
Man, in 24 hours,
I already had me a little crew.

14:15.180 --> 14:17.171
Shit, I was good.

14:18.984 --> 14:21.214
Every night
was the same shit...

14:21.287 --> 14:24.154
and every day
was just more of it.

14:24.223 --> 14:27.454
I mean, the scariest part
of being in jail to me...

14:27.526 --> 14:29.926
was gettin' used to it.

14:55.721 --> 14:58.485
I could tell Free had been down
for a minute...

14:58.557 --> 15:00.491
'cause he's too laid back.

15:00.559 --> 15:03.221
I mean, every time I'd ask him
what'd he do to get in here...

15:03.295 --> 15:05.923
he'd always say the same shit.

15:05.998 --> 15:07.966
Hey, Free...

15:08.033 --> 15:09.660
keep it real with me, homey.

15:09.735 --> 15:11.726
You know
everything about me, man.

15:11.804 --> 15:14.364
What the fuck
you do to get in here, man?

15:16.942 --> 15:19.740
Listen, a'ight,
mistakes don't matter.

15:19.812 --> 15:22.508
It's the consequences
we gotta live by.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.713
Sometimes
I ain't had no idea...

15:25.784 --> 15:27.979
what the fuck
Free was talkin' about...

15:28.053 --> 15:30.351
but I always listened.

15:32.758 --> 15:34.953
Man, there's a lot of ways
you can kill time...

15:35.027 --> 15:36.460
while you're doing time.

15:36.528 --> 15:39.019
You could work out, exercise...

15:43.068 --> 15:46.060
You could practice
the culinary arts.

15:46.138 --> 15:48.299
You know, cookin'
and all that shit.

15:49.675 --> 15:52.542
Some niggas like to fuck
with carpentry.

15:54.380 --> 15:57.543
While they was having fun
doing all that bullshit...

15:57.616 --> 15:59.607
man, I was trying
to learn the law.

15:59.685 --> 16:01.448
Shit, my appeal
was coming up...

16:01.520 --> 16:04.250
and I wasn't trying
to just rely on my lawyers.

16:04.323 --> 16:06.291
So I studied.

16:10.095 --> 16:13.030
Man, that shit only lasted
about five minutes.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.589
It was too technical for me.

16:17.503 --> 16:21.098
Come on, Akeem. Heh.

16:21.173 --> 16:22.902
Come on, man,
let's go hit the shower.

16:22.975 --> 16:24.442
All right, man, come on.

16:24.510 --> 16:26.000
I'm ready.

16:26.078 --> 16:27.636
Mashallah.

16:27.713 --> 16:30.511
Everything
"Allah" with you, man.

16:30.582 --> 16:32.015
Mashallah.

16:32.084 --> 16:34.211
Get Allah to get us
out of here, man.

16:36.188 --> 16:38.213
- You ready?
- Yeah.

16:56.442 --> 16:57.773
God damn!

16:57.843 --> 16:58.969
What's wrong, bro?

16:59.044 --> 17:01.012
Somebody been
in our fuckin' hut, man!

17:01.080 --> 17:02.308
That's crazy.

17:03.449 --> 17:05.541
Hey, C.O.!

17:06.585 --> 17:07.643
C.O.!

17:07.719 --> 17:09.050
What? You got a problem?

17:09.121 --> 17:11.385
Yeah, man. You walk
this fuckin' block all day.

17:11.457 --> 17:13.925
You ain't see nobody
come in our fuckin' hut?

17:13.992 --> 17:15.755
Oh, you gotta be careful
in here.

17:15.828 --> 17:17.227
You got a lot of nice stuff.

17:17.296 --> 17:19.662
Nice pair of tennis shoes.
Worth a lot.

17:19.731 --> 17:21.756
Man, fuck you!

17:21.834 --> 17:23.597
Fuckin' nut!

17:23.669 --> 17:25.967
Man, that shit don't make
no fuckin' sense.

17:26.038 --> 17:28.598
I mean, why would
somebody run in my hut?

17:28.674 --> 17:32.132
They might as well tie the sheet
round their neck theirself.

17:32.211 --> 17:35.544
I mean, you gonna risk your life
over a pair of sneakers?

17:35.614 --> 17:37.912
Nah, man.

17:37.983 --> 17:40.349
And to make matters worse...

17:40.419 --> 17:43.911
the next day, my man D-Nice
came to visit me.

17:43.989 --> 17:47.425
He only show up when
he gotta tell me good news.

17:47.493 --> 17:49.051
What's up, D?

17:49.128 --> 17:51.995
What's up, man. You know
I had to come see my boy, man.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.097
They call me Billy D-Nice...

17:54.166 --> 17:56.726
smooth, smart, and poz.

17:56.802 --> 17:58.702
Always level-headed.

17:58.770 --> 18:01.136
Yeah, long time
no hear from, man.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.673
What's goin' on, man?

18:02.741 --> 18:04.231
Everything's good.

18:07.846 --> 18:09.609
Everything good?

18:09.681 --> 18:11.012
Everything's good.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.142
I hate these fuckin'
visiting rooms...

18:13.218 --> 18:15.778
talkin' on
these nut-ass phones.

18:15.854 --> 18:18.482
They're probably taping us
right now.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.457
Talk to me, though.
What's goin' on, man?

18:20.526 --> 18:22.585
Well, we had a party.

18:26.098 --> 18:27.292
Y'all had a party?

18:27.366 --> 18:30.096
Actually, we've had
four parties the past two weeks.

18:30.169 --> 18:32.296
Y'all had four parties?

18:32.371 --> 18:33.804
Past two weeks.

18:33.872 --> 18:36.033
We had one in West Philly.
Surprise party.

18:36.108 --> 18:38.076
Hold it. Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move.

18:38.143 --> 18:39.303
I didn't do shit, man.

18:39.378 --> 18:41.437
What the fuck
is y'all doin', man?

18:41.513 --> 18:43.481
Come on, man.

18:46.718 --> 18:48.686
You know how I like those,
though, right?

18:48.754 --> 18:50.984
You know,
I like surprise parties, man.

18:51.056 --> 18:53.854
Yeah. Oh, Nada had a party.

18:54.893 --> 18:56.622
Yo, give me that bag.

18:56.695 --> 18:57.719
- Don't move.
- Give me that.

18:57.796 --> 18:59.525
- Good-bye.
- Motherfuckers.

19:02.968 --> 19:04.299
Your man Nada?

19:04.369 --> 19:06.564
My man Nada.

19:06.638 --> 19:09.072
How'd that party turn out?

19:09.141 --> 19:11.632
No bitches there.

19:11.710 --> 19:13.075
All niggas.

19:13.145 --> 19:15.909
- All niggas?
- Dirty niggas, at that.

19:15.981 --> 19:18.916
Y'all found out who fuckin'
promoted that party?

19:18.984 --> 19:20.918
We're still tryin'
to figure that out now.

19:20.986 --> 19:22.351
Yeah, y'all need
to find that out, man.

19:22.421 --> 19:23.911
Get y'all fuckin' money back.

19:25.257 --> 19:28.420
Oh, yeah. Chris and Neef saw
your man Dame on South Street.

19:28.493 --> 19:29.892
Dame?

19:37.069 --> 19:38.866
Fuck Dame, man.

19:38.937 --> 19:41.201
Talk to me
about these parties, man.

19:41.273 --> 19:43.867
Your boys from down
M-l-A came up, man.

19:43.942 --> 19:45.671
They had a crazy party.

19:45.744 --> 19:47.041
Who threw them a party?

19:47.112 --> 19:48.272
Baby Boy.

19:48.347 --> 19:49.314
I'll call you back.

19:49.381 --> 19:50.905
That's him right there, man.

19:50.983 --> 19:53.713
He's makin' that money.
He's takin' those shots, man.

19:56.088 --> 19:58.682
Babito.

19:58.757 --> 20:00.054
Remember me?

20:00.125 --> 20:03.026
Mario, what's the situation,
playboy?

20:03.095 --> 20:04.562
I'm surprised to see
y'all around here.

20:04.630 --> 20:06.325
Ain't it too cool
for you motherfuckers?

20:06.398 --> 20:08.992
You don't call me no more.
You make me come up here...

20:09.067 --> 20:10.694
and talk to you
in person now, huh?

20:10.769 --> 20:12.896
Hey, I ain't been callin' you,
motherfucker.

20:12.971 --> 20:14.768
What am I callin' you for?
I ain't viz.

20:14.840 --> 20:15.898
I'm sick of playing with you.

20:15.974 --> 20:17.271
Where's my motherfuckin' money?

20:17.342 --> 20:18.809
Hey, man, who the fuck
is you talkin' to like that?

20:18.877 --> 20:21.175
Don't come and disrespect me
on my block in front of my boys.

20:21.246 --> 20:23.305
Fuck y'all guala-gualas, man.

20:23.382 --> 20:24.644
What, nigga? What?

20:24.716 --> 20:27.116
Fuck y'all. Fuck y'all niggas.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.949
Yeah. Baby Boy...
the wild card.

20:30.022 --> 20:32.149
I keep the ABM in the game.

20:32.224 --> 20:33.623
We got guns, too, nigga.

20:33.692 --> 20:34.954
Go ahead, nigga. Go ahead.

20:35.027 --> 20:36.961
Shoot, nigga. We got guns, too.

20:37.029 --> 20:38.496
Chill out.

20:38.563 --> 20:39.655
Fuck y'all.

20:39.731 --> 20:41.494
Fuck you, Mario.

20:41.566 --> 20:42.692
Lucky I like him.

20:42.768 --> 20:44.133
I don't give a fuck
who you like, nigga.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.261
- I want my money.
- Well, come take it.

20:46.338 --> 20:48.329
You ain't never
gettin' paid, nigga!

20:48.407 --> 20:50.238
Baby Boy
threw them a party, huh?

20:50.309 --> 20:51.799
A crazy party.

20:51.877 --> 20:53.139
He ate all the chicken, man.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.838
He fucked all the chicken up.

20:54.913 --> 20:57.177
Fucked all the chicken up, huh?

20:57.249 --> 20:58.978
All the chicken.

20:59.051 --> 21:01.645
I guess what they say is true...

21:01.720 --> 21:03.483
shit happen in threes.

21:03.555 --> 21:07.252
'Cause in three months,
our main spot get raided...

21:09.227 --> 21:11.957
one of our top workers
gets robbed...

21:12.030 --> 21:15.363
and what's supposed to be
my fuckin' right-hand man...

21:15.434 --> 21:18.028
is going through some bullshit
with the connect.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.668
You should get his number
and invite him to the party.

21:24.743 --> 21:27.940
They throwin' all kinds
of parties out there, man.

21:28.013 --> 21:30.413
Y'all just livin' it.

21:30.482 --> 21:32.973
I'm in here,
and y'all out there partyin'.

21:33.051 --> 21:35.713
That's what's up, D.

21:35.787 --> 21:37.220
That's what's up, man.

21:37.289 --> 21:40.884
Oh. I need you to do me a favor.

21:40.959 --> 21:43.985
You, Baby Boy...

21:44.062 --> 21:46.326
stop fuckin' partying.

21:46.398 --> 21:48.059
Can you do that?

21:48.133 --> 21:49.691
I can do that.

21:49.768 --> 21:52.032
All right, man.
'Cause, I mean...

21:52.104 --> 21:54.868
I hate to say it, man, but...

21:54.940 --> 21:56.669
I'm proud of y'all, man.

22:00.212 --> 22:01.406
Nah, seriously.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.313
I'm real fuckin' proud
of y'all, man.

22:05.617 --> 22:08.745
Damn! These niggas
out here fuckin' up...

22:08.820 --> 22:10.378
and I'm in here.

22:10.455 --> 22:12.548
Man, I can't be
in this bitch stressin'.

22:13.859 --> 22:15.224
Fuckin' partyin'.

22:15.293 --> 22:16.920
I know what the fuck
I'm gonna do, though.

22:17.429 --> 22:20.159
I'm gonna call my girl Aisha
and get some love.

22:20.232 --> 22:22.462
Fuck.
Thugs need love, too, right?

22:22.534 --> 22:24.058
- Hello?
- This is the operator.

22:24.136 --> 22:25.797
You have a collect call
from Beans.

22:25.871 --> 22:27.133
Will you accept the charges?

22:27.205 --> 22:28.672
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.765
Hey, baby. It's Beans.

22:30.842 --> 22:31.900
Who?

22:31.977 --> 22:33.842
It's Beans. What's up, Boo?

22:33.912 --> 22:36.642
Beans? Yeah, well,
I don't know any Beans.

22:36.715 --> 22:38.842
Hey, stop fuckin'
playin' with me, man.

22:38.917 --> 22:40.851
Listen here.
I'm not fuckin' playin', OK?

22:40.919 --> 22:42.318
Do I sound like I'm playin'?

22:42.387 --> 22:43.479
I'm not playin' with you.

22:43.555 --> 22:44.783
Aisha, who the fuck
you talkin' to?

22:44.856 --> 22:46.187
Because you said
that you promised...

22:46.258 --> 22:47.885
that you weren't gonna
leave us, that's why.

22:47.959 --> 22:49.620
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold the fuck up.

22:49.694 --> 22:51.286
Aisha, you know
who you talkin' to?

22:51.363 --> 22:53.729
I don't give a fuck,
you fuckin' fat, black bitch.

22:53.799 --> 22:54.959
Let me fuckin' tell you...

22:55.033 --> 22:56.523
What the fuck
is you yellin' for?

22:56.601 --> 22:58.364
What the fuck
I'm supposed to do, huh?

22:58.437 --> 22:59.734
What I'm supposed to do?

22:59.805 --> 23:02.330
What is your wife and daughter
supposed to do now, huh?

23:02.407 --> 23:04.238
Fuckin' tell me that,
you fuckin' inmate!

23:04.309 --> 23:06.675
You convict! What the fuck
I'm supposed to do?

23:06.745 --> 23:08.975
Fuck you, Beans! Whatever!

23:09.047 --> 23:10.378
He-hello?

23:11.683 --> 23:13.014
Hello?

23:13.084 --> 23:14.915
This motherfucker done hung up.

23:23.895 --> 23:26.022
Hey, Nut.
You see this nigga?

23:26.097 --> 23:28.565
That's the nigga
who ran in our fuckin' hut.

23:28.633 --> 23:30.999
- What? Where?
- Don't look, don't look.

23:31.069 --> 23:32.798
This nigga right here, man.

23:32.871 --> 23:34.236
Damn, that is that nigga.

23:34.306 --> 23:36.536
They're your sneaks.
What you gonna do, see?

23:36.608 --> 23:38.940
What the fuck
you think I'm gonna do?

23:39.010 --> 23:40.443
I'm gonna get me a banger...

23:40.512 --> 23:42.707
and I'm gonna poke
this nigga the fuck up.

23:42.781 --> 23:44.840
There you go.
Let me handle that, dawg.

23:44.916 --> 23:46.440
Nah, nah.

23:46.518 --> 23:48.110
I go wash my ass...

23:48.186 --> 23:49.949
and this nigga

23:50.021 --> 23:52.455
and take my shit?

23:52.524 --> 23:54.685
I got to do
this one myself, man.

23:56.127 --> 23:57.219
Yeah, all right, man.

23:57.295 --> 23:58.785
What's up with Baby Boy?

24:00.665 --> 24:02.724
Man, we need a new connect, man.

24:02.801 --> 24:04.632
Well, get one, then.

24:04.703 --> 24:07.831
You sayin' that like
that shit's so fuckin' simple.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.134
"Go get one, then."

24:09.207 --> 24:10.697
How the fuck
I'm gonna get a connect...

24:10.775 --> 24:12.003
when I'm in here with you?

24:12.077 --> 24:13.339
This man right here.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.936
And he can get you
them bangers.

24:16.014 --> 24:18.505
Who... Damn,
all this time, Free...

24:18.583 --> 24:19.777
and you ain't say nothin'?

24:19.851 --> 24:21.478
You never asked, a'ight?

24:21.553 --> 24:25.649
Listen, my man Loco over
in the Spanish house...

24:25.724 --> 24:27.385
I used to roll with him
back in the day.

24:27.459 --> 24:30.189
He get out in a month.

24:30.262 --> 24:32.253
Set that shit up, then, man.

24:32.330 --> 24:34.457
See, that's what the fuck
I'm talkin' about.

24:34.533 --> 24:37.001
It turns out my celly
was the fuckin' man.

24:37.068 --> 24:40.299
He had a connect,
and he can get me a banger.

24:40.372 --> 24:43.034
All this time,
and he ain't said shit.

24:43.108 --> 24:44.837
I knew I liked
that motherfucker.

24:44.910 --> 24:47.242
Say no more. I got you.

24:51.249 --> 24:54.810
Free's connect
was this guy El Pollo Loco.

24:54.886 --> 24:56.786
He got me what I needed...

24:56.855 --> 24:58.686
and that was that.

25:36.094 --> 25:37.527
Get the fuck up.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.654
You step to me in my cell?

25:43.835 --> 25:45.928
Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

25:47.272 --> 25:48.739
Shut up, shut up.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.370
Motherfucker.

26:12.030 --> 26:14.863
The next morning,
they snatched me and Loco up...

26:14.933 --> 26:17.697
sat us down
in front of the warden...

26:17.769 --> 26:21.500
chump arrogant-ass
motherfucker.

26:21.573 --> 26:23.040
Yo. Police comin', yo.

26:23.108 --> 26:25.042
Find out if that nigga
snitched on me, ya hear me?

26:25.110 --> 26:27.908
They said
he was dirtier than shit.

26:27.979 --> 26:29.879
They all dirty to me.

26:29.948 --> 26:32.508
He tried to make me
and Loco snitch.

26:32.584 --> 26:35.246
Shit, I'd rather die
than be labeled a rat.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.084
El Pollo Loco.

26:38.156 --> 26:40.886
Now, that's a great nickname.

26:40.959 --> 26:43.018
"Crazy chicken," right?

26:45.330 --> 26:47.389
You know what's funny?

26:47.465 --> 26:50.457
My 2-year-old has a nickname.

26:50.535 --> 26:53.504
We call her
Blueberry Muffin Stinky Butt.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.562
You got that goin' for you.

26:56.908 --> 26:59.308
When's your parole here?
On the 17th?

26:59.377 --> 27:01.311
What's that, a month?

27:01.379 --> 27:03.210
Less than a month.

27:04.849 --> 27:06.476
You have one month left.

27:06.551 --> 27:08.849
You're handing out ice picks?

27:10.488 --> 27:12.718
You know that he died, right?

27:12.791 --> 27:15.919
Yeah. You're an accomplice.

27:17.162 --> 27:19.858
Murder One.

27:21.232 --> 27:23.291
The whole thing's on tape.

27:23.368 --> 27:27.134
We showed that tape to
your friend Beans this morning.

27:27.205 --> 27:29.070
Took him about ten seconds...

27:29.140 --> 27:31.608
and he was singing your name.

27:31.676 --> 27:33.405
"Loco!"

27:34.746 --> 27:36.304
It's disgusting.

27:36.381 --> 27:38.406
But what are you gonna do?

27:38.483 --> 27:42.385
Ask me... I say fuck him.

27:42.454 --> 27:44.547
He ratted you out.

27:44.622 --> 27:46.556
He's already in the box.

27:46.624 --> 27:49.718
You want to do
three more years for this guy?

27:49.794 --> 27:51.352
Get out there.

27:51.429 --> 27:54.193
Go make some money,
do something, huh?

27:55.433 --> 27:57.867
Have you ever been in the hole?

27:57.936 --> 28:00.666
It's unbearable.

28:00.739 --> 28:02.866
I tried it for
an hour and a half once...

28:02.941 --> 28:04.465
see what it felt like.

28:04.542 --> 28:08.376
Thought I was
literally going to die.

28:08.446 --> 28:11.040
And you're looking at, what...

28:11.116 --> 28:15.712
730 days, Mister...

28:16.888 --> 28:18.947
Beans?
What kind of name is that?

28:19.023 --> 28:22.015
You're a fuckin' grown man.

28:22.093 --> 28:24.755
Do me a favor.

28:24.829 --> 28:27.297
How much did he charge you
for the shiv?

28:27.365 --> 28:29.595
I hope it was cheap...

28:29.667 --> 28:31.931
'cause that
half-Puerto Rican rat fuck...

28:32.003 --> 28:34.494
sold you up the river like...

28:36.941 --> 28:38.932
OK.

28:39.010 --> 28:41.478
Don't want to talk.
I hear you. Good for you.

28:41.546 --> 28:43.844
You know we have it on tape,
though, right?

28:43.915 --> 28:47.248
You know that?
But you don't want my help.

28:47.318 --> 28:51.118
You don't need my help
'cause you're a gangsta!

28:51.189 --> 28:54.386
Fantastic.
Hey, it's gonna be a pleasure...

28:54.459 --> 28:56.950
to watch you grow old,
tough guy.

28:57.028 --> 28:59.019
Yeah. Yeah.

28:59.097 --> 29:01.463
Your daughter's not gonna get
to see her father...

29:01.533 --> 29:03.763
because you're state property.

29:05.703 --> 29:08.001
Nice.

29:08.072 --> 29:11.007
You think
you're a killer, Beans?

29:11.075 --> 29:12.736
You want to kill something?

29:16.080 --> 29:17.741
Kill time.

29:20.852 --> 29:23.616
Now, get the fuck
out of my office.

29:23.688 --> 29:25.451
They ain't have me on tape.

29:25.523 --> 29:27.047
They ain't had shit.

29:27.125 --> 29:29.286
They gave me and Loco
about an hour in the box.

29:29.360 --> 29:30.520
Lucky day.

29:30.595 --> 29:32.324
I mean,
I don't even know this dude...

29:32.397 --> 29:34.490
but he kept his mouth closed.

29:34.566 --> 29:36.932
You gotta respect that.

29:43.341 --> 29:44.740
Hey, what's happening?

29:44.809 --> 29:46.743
But I had
a lot of questions for him...

29:46.811 --> 29:49.678
and I knew he must have had
a lot of questions for me...

29:49.747 --> 29:53.274
so I told Free
to set it up ASAP.

29:53.351 --> 29:56.650
It was time for me to meet
this guala face-to-face.

29:56.721 --> 29:58.780
I'm goin', all right?

29:58.857 --> 30:00.256
Fuck the police.

30:00.325 --> 30:01.952
You know how we do.
We're gonna get this shit.

30:02.026 --> 30:03.516
For sho', man.

30:05.129 --> 30:08.030
El Pollo Loco...
international hustler...

30:08.099 --> 30:11.193
ambassador of coke.
I'm a fuckin' legend.

30:11.269 --> 30:12.668
What's up, fam?

30:12.737 --> 30:15.729
Yo, good lookin' out on
that thing we did earlier, man.

30:15.807 --> 30:17.069
Yeah, positive.

30:17.141 --> 30:19.302
I appreciate you keepin'
your mouth closed, too, Bear.

30:19.377 --> 30:21.368
Yeah. Beans.

30:21.446 --> 30:23.641
Loco. Bear...

30:23.715 --> 30:26.047
If he was gonna be
the new ABM connect...

30:26.117 --> 30:28.381
I had to know everything
about him.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.751
I grew up in Miami.

30:30.822 --> 30:33.689
Spoiled as shit.
I had everything.

30:40.098 --> 30:42.157
Pops was
a half a thug from Philly...

30:42.233 --> 30:43.700
pretty motherfucker.

30:43.768 --> 30:46.498
Ma Dukes straight out of
Fajardo, Puerto Rico.

30:46.571 --> 30:49.734
Came to Miami in '75
with a killer smile...

30:49.807 --> 30:51.365
and serious game.

30:51.442 --> 30:53.069
She was business
in high heels...

30:53.144 --> 30:55.044
and he was grimy on the trigger.

30:58.816 --> 31:00.215
The truth is...

31:00.285 --> 31:02.685
even though Pops liked to think
he was Scarface...

31:02.754 --> 31:04.187
when it came down to it...

31:04.255 --> 31:05.813
Yo, you got that yeyo?

31:05.890 --> 31:07.619
You got the money?

31:07.692 --> 31:09.523
You got the fuckin' yeyo?

31:09.594 --> 31:11.425
You got the fuckin' money?

31:12.997 --> 31:14.726
When it came down to it...

31:14.799 --> 31:16.528
Mama Love
was the real gangsta.

31:16.601 --> 31:17.795
What the fuck?

31:19.771 --> 31:22.501
Ooh, ooh, Papi,
you talk too much.

31:22.573 --> 31:24.905
Get the yeyo,
let's get the fuck out of here.

31:24.976 --> 31:27.501
The first lady kingpin
in the history of SoBe...

31:27.578 --> 31:29.045
South Beach, Florida.

31:29.113 --> 31:31.343
They got married and got on
some Bonnie and Clyde shit...

31:31.416 --> 31:32.883
for at least six years.

31:32.951 --> 31:34.418
At least, that's what I heard.

31:34.485 --> 31:35.884
I barely knew either one.

31:37.188 --> 31:38.678
I was alone all the time.

31:38.756 --> 31:41.247
Developed
a slight disciplinary problem.

31:41.326 --> 31:43.385
Fuck A.D.D.

31:43.461 --> 31:46.225
I had A.D.D.D.D.D.D.D.

31:47.966 --> 31:50.491
My pops' right hand
was this cat named Biggis.

31:50.568 --> 31:52.536
They grew up in Philly together.

31:52.603 --> 31:55.071
He's basically known for
knockin' niggas the fuck out.

31:55.139 --> 31:57.801
He fought professional
for a hot minute...

31:57.875 --> 31:59.172
got a couple of belts.

31:59.243 --> 32:01.711
Biggis hated everybody...

32:01.779 --> 32:03.679
except me and my family.

32:03.748 --> 32:05.340
What are you doing, Loco?

32:05.416 --> 32:07.680
He kept me safe
my whole life, though.

32:07.752 --> 32:09.413
You want to tear shit up, huh?

32:09.487 --> 32:11.580
Huh? You gonna step?
Put your hands up. Come on.

32:11.656 --> 32:13.021
Can't step up?
Come on. Come on.

32:13.091 --> 32:14.991
You need to put your hands
like this.

32:15.059 --> 32:16.822
Come on! Come on!

32:19.063 --> 32:20.257
OK, you win.

32:20.331 --> 32:22.595
There was so much yeyo
in South Beach...

32:22.667 --> 32:24.430
you have no idea!

32:24.502 --> 32:26.333
It was everywhere.

32:26.404 --> 32:28.497
My parents were
so wrapped up in the game...

32:28.573 --> 32:30.473
no matter how much
I fucked up...

32:30.541 --> 32:33.032
I never even got a beating.

32:34.379 --> 32:37.644
Then, one morning,
everything changed.

32:39.117 --> 32:41.415
Biggis never put me on
to the whole story.

32:41.486 --> 32:42.919
He said it didn't matter.

32:42.987 --> 32:45.785
They were both gone
and never gonna come back.

32:45.857 --> 32:47.347
You OK, man? Come here.

32:49.394 --> 32:53.490
Over the next 16 years,
Biggis was always there.

32:53.564 --> 32:54.531
Biggis! What the fuck?

32:54.599 --> 32:55.793
Happy birthday, kid.

32:55.867 --> 32:57.494
My man... a pea shooter?

32:57.568 --> 32:59.229
Biggis damn near raised me...

32:59.303 --> 33:01.669
kept me out of trouble,
showed me how to hustle...

33:01.739 --> 33:03.400
put money in my pocket...

33:03.474 --> 33:05.408
and the occasional
semi-automatic weapon...

33:05.476 --> 33:07.376
in my hittin' hand.

33:07.445 --> 33:09.310
Man, I have fuckin' rims
that cost more than that.

33:09.380 --> 33:12.713
Bottom line...
Biggis was my only family...

33:12.784 --> 33:14.411
and I loved him.

33:15.787 --> 33:17.948
Now, around my 18th birthday...

33:18.022 --> 33:20.217
Biggis put me on
to this new dude...

33:20.291 --> 33:22.418
El Plaga... The Plague.

33:22.493 --> 33:24.586
He was off the yelzabar...

33:24.662 --> 33:26.254
and if he wanted something...

33:26.330 --> 33:28.560
he was just gonna take the shit.

33:32.804 --> 33:34.897
I was the spokesperson...

33:34.972 --> 33:37.907
public relations nigga.
You figga deal me?

33:37.975 --> 33:39.943
Whoever El Plaga
wanted to meet...

33:40.011 --> 33:41.603
he'll tell Biggis...

33:41.679 --> 33:43.408
and Biggis will send me out...

33:43.481 --> 33:45.210
and I never even met the nigga.

33:45.283 --> 33:47.478
But 'cause
I was fuckin' with him...

33:47.552 --> 33:49.713
wherever I go in the 3-0-5...

33:49.787 --> 33:51.778
my name would ring bells.

33:51.856 --> 33:54.416
Miami was
my personal playground.

33:54.492 --> 33:58.258
Business was so good that
a mid-level nigga like me...

33:58.329 --> 34:00.263
was makin' kingpin paper.

34:00.331 --> 34:02.094
I was runnin' around
clippin' birds...

34:02.166 --> 34:03.394
feedin' pigeons...

34:03.468 --> 34:06.494
like El Pollo Loco! What!

34:06.571 --> 34:08.539
That was my downfall...

34:08.606 --> 34:10.164
my only weakness...

34:10.241 --> 34:12.402
the one thing Biggis,
El Plaga...

34:12.476 --> 34:14.467
no one could save me from...

34:14.545 --> 34:16.034
bitches.

34:18.483 --> 34:20.781
I had a stable of dimes...

34:20.851 --> 34:23.081
one for every day of the week.

34:33.965 --> 34:35.626
You don't love me, nigga.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.565
If you loved me,
you wouldn't call me Tuesday.

34:37.635 --> 34:39.193
If you loved me,
you would call me Missy.

34:39.270 --> 34:41.261
That's my fuckin' name,
and you call me Tuesday.

34:41.339 --> 34:43.398
You call my house
and you ask for Tuesday.

34:43.474 --> 34:45.065
You see,
the trouble started...

34:45.143 --> 34:47.304
when my Tuesday bitch
wanted the Friday slot.

34:47.378 --> 34:48.969
And I gave it to her!

34:49.045 --> 34:50.809
I moved Friday to Saturday...

34:50.882 --> 34:53.476
then Saturday started beefin'.

34:53.551 --> 34:54.779
The point is...

34:54.851 --> 34:57.650
no one can fuck you
like someone you're fuckin'.

34:58.990 --> 35:02.517
I was enjoying my Friday night
when it happened.

35:05.730 --> 35:06.992
Yo.

35:07.064 --> 35:09.464
Hey, Boo, it's Missy.

35:09.534 --> 35:11.525
Who?

35:11.602 --> 35:13.365
Tuesday!

35:13.437 --> 35:15.371
Tuesday?
What the fuck is up?

35:15.439 --> 35:16.929
It's not your day of the week.

35:17.008 --> 35:19.704
I'm just callin' to tell you
I'm not gonna make it next week.

35:19.777 --> 35:21.210
But don't worry...

35:21.279 --> 35:23.304
'cause you're gonna be
locked up by then anyway.

35:23.381 --> 35:25.713
Enjoy prison,
you stupid motherfucker!

35:29.320 --> 35:31.254
And that's all I needed to hear.

35:34.892 --> 35:37.520
I got the money,
cleaned the crib...

35:37.595 --> 35:39.460
and got the fuck
up out of there.

35:39.530 --> 35:42.055
The bitch set me up.
But that's all right, though.

35:42.133 --> 35:43.862
The crib was clean.

35:43.935 --> 35:45.596
Before the cops knew
what hit 'em...

35:45.670 --> 35:48.070
I was on my way
to Philadelph-i-a.

35:48.139 --> 35:49.970
You figga deal me?

35:50.041 --> 35:52.407
Spent some time in Queens.

35:52.476 --> 35:54.569
But Philly was in my blood.

35:54.645 --> 35:56.442
El Plaga wanted me
to go out there...

35:56.514 --> 36:00.746
check out this new boss,
wanted some heavy work. Heavy.

36:00.818 --> 36:02.718
Fast, slick-talkin' type
of nigga.

36:02.787 --> 36:04.721
You ever heard of
the Dame, nigga?

36:15.032 --> 36:16.795
Yeah, I know that nigga.

36:16.867 --> 36:19.893
Well, El Plaga wanted me to
go out there and check him.

36:19.971 --> 36:21.461
As a matter of fact,
he wanted me...

36:21.539 --> 36:23.700
to go out there and check
every-motherfuckin'-body...

36:23.774 --> 36:26.174
plant some seeds,
get some trees there...

36:26.244 --> 36:27.541
branches, leaves...

36:27.612 --> 36:30.012
take over the whole grass plant.
You figga deal me?

36:30.548 --> 36:32.880
El Plaga was right about
Philly's untapped potential.

36:32.950 --> 36:34.281
Dame nigga was the only nigga...

36:34.352 --> 36:36.286
who really put on
some real scrilla.

36:36.354 --> 36:38.117
I understand all that.

36:38.189 --> 36:41.215
But why the fuck
they call that nigga El Plaga?

36:41.292 --> 36:43.556
'Cause he gets
into the system...

36:43.628 --> 36:46.461
shut that motherfucker down
like it's a virus.

36:46.530 --> 36:48.293
You figga deal me?

36:52.503 --> 36:54.232
You want some Jell-O?

36:54.305 --> 36:55.772
Nah.

36:57.041 --> 36:58.531
El Plaga hooked me up
with this botanica...

36:58.609 --> 37:00.474
know what I mean,
on the South Side.

37:00.544 --> 37:02.774
I got the homeboy Freeway
to run the spot.

37:02.847 --> 37:04.906
It was like we was legit.

37:04.982 --> 37:06.279
Cops were paid...

37:06.350 --> 37:09.615
and for at least three months,
nobody fucked with us.

37:09.687 --> 37:11.621
I was about to go back
down to Miami.

37:11.689 --> 37:13.850
I got some info
on who killed my parents.

37:13.924 --> 37:16.722
But before I could even
pack my bags...

37:16.794 --> 37:18.455
fuckin' raid,
by some other cops.

37:18.529 --> 37:19.496
What you runnin' for?

37:19.563 --> 37:21.224
Freeze! Show me your hands!

37:21.299 --> 37:22.561
Is there a problem, officer?

37:22.633 --> 37:24.123
I was definitely set up.

37:24.201 --> 37:25.634
Who you with,
the trench coat mafia?

37:25.703 --> 37:29.161
They busted in with
the K-9 unit looking for it.

37:29.240 --> 37:31.572
I had the coke baked
into these Virgin Mary statues.

37:31.642 --> 37:34.270
They were supposed
to be untraceable.

37:34.345 --> 37:37.143
But Rover had a strong nose.
Figga deal me?

37:37.214 --> 37:38.408
We got something here.

37:38.482 --> 37:40.916
He got a taste
of El Plaga's finest!

37:40.985 --> 37:42.077
What's this?

37:44.388 --> 37:45.787
It's money.

37:47.325 --> 37:48.292
Bingo.

37:48.359 --> 37:50.418
Bingo.

37:50.494 --> 37:52.621
That dog must have felt
like king of the world...

37:52.697 --> 37:54.858
for about five seconds.

37:54.932 --> 37:56.422
Jesus.

37:56.500 --> 37:59.333
There's a lot of money
in these religious statues.

37:59.403 --> 38:01.098
I think
I'm in the wrong business.

38:01.172 --> 38:02.833
You should get a colonic.

38:02.907 --> 38:04.772
Colonic.
I'll give you a fuckin' colonic.

38:06.177 --> 38:07.735
Read these scumbags
their rights...

38:07.812 --> 38:09.507
and get these pieces of shit
out of here.

38:09.580 --> 38:11.377
All right, I want everything
bagged and tagged in here.

38:11.449 --> 38:13.713
By the numbers!
Everything is dirty!

38:13.784 --> 38:15.342
Bag and tag everything!

38:17.321 --> 38:19.516
I lost 900 fuckin' grand.

38:35.873 --> 38:37.966
El Plaga was pissed.

38:38.042 --> 38:40.272
Philly was scared to touch him.

38:40.344 --> 38:42.539
Free got an 8 to 10
on some prior shit...

38:42.613 --> 38:45.605
and I lucked out
with a 3 to 6.

38:45.683 --> 38:48.208
You ain't never find out
who ratted?

38:48.285 --> 38:53.416
Nah, but when I do,
the whole familia lays down.

38:54.759 --> 38:56.556
We got to get in line.

38:56.627 --> 38:59.255
Fucking rat ass niggas, man.

38:59.330 --> 39:01.594
You know, the only thing worse
than a fuckin' rat...

39:01.665 --> 39:02.996
is a faggot.

39:04.869 --> 39:07.360
Shit, at least
you got a hearing coming up.

39:07.438 --> 39:10.703
I can't do shit
out this motherfucker.

39:10.775 --> 39:13.471
I kind of think we could do
something to work that out.

39:13.544 --> 39:14.670
Yeah?

39:14.745 --> 39:16.144
I told you,
El Plaga ain't no joke.

39:16.213 --> 39:17.680
Once he find out
I hit you with the brick...

39:17.748 --> 39:19.045
and then you ain't snitched...

39:19.116 --> 39:22.711
it could be good news
for the both of us.

39:22.787 --> 39:25.779
So, what's up
with this El Plaga nigga?

39:25.856 --> 39:27.949
What he got,
like, the D.A. Or something?

39:28.025 --> 39:29.458
Don't worry about it.

39:29.527 --> 39:32.758
Get your crew to help us out,
and he'll definitely look out...

39:32.830 --> 39:35.924
put us both back in the game.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.094
That's what's up, man.
Whatever you need, fam.

39:39.170 --> 39:40.762
Just livin'.

39:40.838 --> 39:42.430
Poverty.

39:42.506 --> 39:44.337
I was forced
to do the wrong move...

39:44.408 --> 39:46.467
but I've learned my lesson...

39:46.544 --> 39:49.445
during the time
I've been in here.

39:49.513 --> 39:52.880
You know, I got a craft.

39:52.950 --> 39:57.683
You Spanish,
so you figga deal me, right?

39:57.755 --> 39:59.052
Boricua?

39:59.123 --> 40:00.750
Parole boards are hilarious.

40:00.825 --> 40:03.259
Little incident with Beans
actually helped me out.

40:03.327 --> 40:05.022
Worked up
a couple of fake tears...

40:05.095 --> 40:07.290
told them about
missing my 4-year-old son.

40:07.364 --> 40:09.423
Twelve days later, I was out.

40:09.500 --> 40:10.967
I'll start all over.

40:12.102 --> 40:14.070
And I don't even have
a fucking son.

40:14.138 --> 40:16.936
And my kids.

40:17.007 --> 40:19.908
Beans plugged me in
with the ABM set.

40:19.977 --> 40:22.172
I told them that
before we made the deal...

40:22.246 --> 40:25.977
I would have to give his peoples
a little test run.

40:26.050 --> 40:27.142
Make sure they could handle...

40:27.218 --> 40:30.119
all these bricks
I was about to bless them with.

40:31.655 --> 40:32.747
So I got out the crib.

40:32.823 --> 40:34.381
Biggis was there as usual.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.050
He told me El Plaga
was going to give us...

40:36.126 --> 40:38.356
80% of the whole Philly
connection...

40:38.429 --> 40:41.489
and then pull some strings
to try to get Beans out.

40:41.565 --> 40:43.658
He wanted to thank me
for never snitching on him.

40:43.734 --> 40:47.636
How can I snitch on
a motherfucker I never even met?

40:47.705 --> 40:51.106
Anyway, point is,
after all this time...

40:51.175 --> 40:53.939
me and Biggis were back
like we left somethin'.

40:57.681 --> 40:59.478
Meanwhile, back in my world...

40:59.550 --> 41:02.178
Baby Boy and D-Nice
was running the show.

41:02.253 --> 41:03.345
Fuck that.

41:03.420 --> 41:05.012
The tension
was getting too high.

41:05.089 --> 41:07.580
Loco was the perfect cure.

41:07.658 --> 41:10.183
I told Loco
how to deal with Baby Boy...

41:10.261 --> 41:12.695
'cause, you know,
he a little loco hisself.

41:12.763 --> 41:15.789
And I told Baby Boy
if this nigga was for real...

41:15.866 --> 41:18.858
and y'all won't fuck this up,
he might can get me...

41:18.936 --> 41:20.870
back in the streets
in a couple months.

41:20.938 --> 41:24.135
Now, remember the garage
with all the weed?

41:24.208 --> 41:26.176
You know,
where I got my first body at?

41:26.243 --> 41:29.007
Crazy-ass Baby Boy
bought the spot...

41:29.079 --> 41:31.070
and made it
the new ABM hangout.

41:31.148 --> 41:32.706
Hey, yo...

41:32.783 --> 41:34.808
one of y'all niggas
know Baby Boy?

41:38.389 --> 41:40.789
Chris and Neef.

41:40.858 --> 41:43.053
I usually ain't mess
with young bulls.

41:43.127 --> 41:45.288
But these weren't your average
little young bulls.

41:45.362 --> 41:48.126
I mean, these dudes
was totally different.

41:48.198 --> 41:50.428
They was little Gunz.

41:50.501 --> 41:52.025
I know you have it.

41:52.102 --> 41:54.434
See this shit? Go get whoever
the fuck you want.

41:54.505 --> 41:55.802
You little bastard.

41:55.873 --> 41:57.306
I'm tired of
you little motherfuckers...

41:57.374 --> 41:59.171
coming around here.
Go get your fucking 0-8.

41:59.243 --> 42:00.835
I knew there was something
special about them...

42:00.911 --> 42:03.243
when they took over
Fat Stevie's block.

42:03.314 --> 42:05.839
And they was about,
what, 14, 15?

42:05.916 --> 42:07.884
- This motherfucker right here?
- Yeah.

42:09.553 --> 42:10.713
And my man Chris...

42:10.788 --> 42:13.018
he handled that shit
like a grown man.

42:13.090 --> 42:15.024
Who block is it now, pussy?

42:17.294 --> 42:19.455
I was hitting Chris and Neef
5-0 bricks...

42:19.530 --> 42:20.997
when they was, like, 16.

42:21.065 --> 42:23.033
And the whole time
they was hustling...

42:23.100 --> 42:25.591
they was going to school.

42:25.669 --> 42:28.866
I mean, like, they was really
fucking going to school.

42:42.319 --> 42:44.753
Nah, fam.
I don't know no Baby Boy.

42:44.822 --> 42:46.813
Well, a friend of mine
said I could find...

42:46.890 --> 42:48.949
Baby Boy over here.

42:49.026 --> 42:52.291
Oh, yeah?
What friend would that be?

42:52.363 --> 42:55.491
Beans, nigga.

42:55.566 --> 42:59.366
Nah. Wouldn't say Beans, playa.

42:59.436 --> 43:01.063
Well, figga deal me on this.

43:01.138 --> 43:04.437
If you happen to fall and trip
and bump into the nigga...

43:04.508 --> 43:07.272
let him know El Pollo Loco
came through.

43:07.344 --> 43:08.936
Feliz Navidad.

43:09.013 --> 43:10.503
El Pollo Loco?

43:10.581 --> 43:12.481
Yeah, OK, Papi.

43:12.549 --> 43:14.107
What'd he say, Loco?

43:14.184 --> 43:15.651
Get yourself Pollo Loco?

43:15.719 --> 43:16.811
Yeah, man, this clown here.

43:16.887 --> 43:18.286
Oh, yeah? Oh.

43:18.355 --> 43:21.381
Oh, man, well, if it ain't
the infamous El Pollo Loco.

43:21.458 --> 43:22.789
What's up, playboy?

43:22.860 --> 43:23.986
I'm Baby Boy.
What's the situation?

43:24.061 --> 43:25.221
Hey, what's up, man?

43:25.295 --> 43:27.525
- This is Biggis right here.
- What's up, dawg?

43:27.598 --> 43:29.691
Hey, I thought you was Spanish.

43:29.767 --> 43:31.928
Nigga-Rican...
black and Spanish.

43:32.002 --> 43:34.436
Yeah? So, what bring
y'all through here?

43:34.505 --> 43:36.234
Check this out, man.
Why don't you hop in the car...

43:36.306 --> 43:38.069
we'll go get some bacalao,
some arroz con pollo.

43:38.142 --> 43:39.336
Get you right.

43:39.410 --> 43:40.536
Figga deal me,
we get you a gordito.

43:40.611 --> 43:42.772
- Come on, man.
- OK. Yo, I'll be right back.

43:42.846 --> 43:44.473
I'm gonna holler
at my new friends, a'ight?

43:44.548 --> 43:45.708
- Yeah.
- I'll be back.

43:45.783 --> 43:46.909
You know,
I love these guala-gualas.

43:46.984 --> 43:48.349
Yeah. We'll send him back...

43:48.419 --> 43:50.580
with a lot of arroz con pollo
in his system.

43:50.654 --> 43:52.144
Figga deal me?

43:56.994 --> 43:59.895
Loco explained the situation
to Baby Boy.

43:59.963 --> 44:01.089
The first thing he had to do...

44:01.165 --> 44:03.599
was pick up a package
that belonged to El Plaga.

44:03.667 --> 44:05.259
That's all he said.

44:05.335 --> 44:07.701
He didn't say who they was
supposed to get it from...

44:07.771 --> 44:09.705
or how they was supposed
to get it.

44:09.773 --> 44:12.833
Only thing he said was that
the package was stashed...

44:12.910 --> 44:14.673
in a bathroom
at this burger joint.

44:14.745 --> 44:16.076
Keep the car running, gun.

44:16.146 --> 44:17.408
You know what to do
if something happen.

44:17.481 --> 44:19.381
- Oh, yeah, I got you.
- A'ight.

44:19.450 --> 44:21.975
The package is
at the burger spot in Philly.

44:22.052 --> 44:24.452
Now, don't take these niggas
for suckers.

44:24.521 --> 44:25.988
Watch your back.

44:26.056 --> 44:29.685
When you get that package,
bring it straight to me.

44:29.760 --> 44:33.218
Do not open it.
Don't fuck with me.

44:33.297 --> 44:34.559
You pull this off...

44:34.631 --> 44:36.656
I'll probably get your boy
back on the street...

44:36.734 --> 44:39.430
and I'll throw you
some real work.

44:40.971 --> 44:42.768
Yo, Rudy.

44:42.840 --> 44:43.829
Yo, Fanlan!

44:43.907 --> 44:45.033
Yeah, yeah. What's up, baby?

44:45.109 --> 44:46.371
Yeah. Can I help you?

44:50.948 --> 44:53.280
Yeah, what's up, man?
What you need?

44:53.350 --> 44:56.046
Yeah. What you got
good back there?

44:56.120 --> 44:58.179
The hamburgers is good.
They're handmade.

44:59.656 --> 45:00.816
You want a hamburger?

45:02.292 --> 45:04.226
All right, give me a burger.

45:04.294 --> 45:06.057
OK. A burger, coming up.

45:07.264 --> 45:08.788
Rudy, you got a bathroom, man?

45:08.866 --> 45:10.390
It's right there.

45:10.467 --> 45:11.593
All right.

45:42.599 --> 45:44.226
Hey, yo,
how about your burger, man?

45:44.301 --> 45:45.859
I'm cool, fam.

45:45.936 --> 45:47.494
Hey, yo, pard, come here.
Let me holler at you.

45:47.571 --> 45:48.629
What the fuck y'all want?

45:48.705 --> 45:50.332
Come here for a minute, dawg.

45:50.407 --> 45:51.772
Fuckin' holler later.

45:54.344 --> 45:55.470
Gotta go.

46:08.158 --> 46:10.524
Goddamn, fam,
y'all could've told me...

46:10.594 --> 46:12.528
we was running into some shit.
We get to the spot.

46:12.596 --> 46:13.620
Motherfuckers
shooting at us and shit.

46:13.697 --> 46:14.857
What the fuck is that about?

46:14.932 --> 46:16.991
It's all gravy down, nigga.
Good job.

46:17.067 --> 46:18.694
Where the package at?

46:18.769 --> 46:20.566
What? Your package?

46:20.637 --> 46:22.537
Who the fuck do he think he is?

46:22.606 --> 46:24.471
El Pollo Loco.

46:24.541 --> 46:26.475
I put my life on the line
for this nigga...

46:26.543 --> 46:28.135
and all he want is his package.

46:28.212 --> 46:29.645
Man, fuck that nigga.

46:30.681 --> 46:32.478
The package, nigga.

46:32.549 --> 46:33.982
Yeah.

46:34.051 --> 46:36.315
Here's your package, fam.

46:36.386 --> 46:38.513
You lucky I ain't
look in that shit, nigga.

46:38.589 --> 46:40.580
Now, we can take care of that
for your man Beans.

46:40.657 --> 46:41.783
Let's get down
to business, though.

46:48.465 --> 46:49.625
It's all there.

46:49.700 --> 46:52.032
Yeah. We need 90 grand
in two weeks, man.

46:53.570 --> 46:54.901
Hold up.

46:54.972 --> 46:56.166
Now, who the fuck is this nigga?

46:56.240 --> 46:58.003
Biggis. Now he want me
to pay him...

46:58.075 --> 47:00.373
for the shit that I stole?
Man, fuck him, too.

47:00.444 --> 47:01.638
Let me get this shit right, fam.

47:01.712 --> 47:03.236
You mean to tell me
we gonna pay you...

47:03.313 --> 47:05.304
90 grand off the shit
we just took?

47:05.382 --> 47:06.679
Off that shit right there?

47:06.750 --> 47:09.617
Now, I've been with Biggis
for oddeen years.

47:09.686 --> 47:12.382
He almost never blows his cool.

47:13.624 --> 47:15.455
But the one thing
that always gets him heated...

47:15.525 --> 47:16.992
is saying the same thing twice.

47:17.060 --> 47:18.527
What the fuck I just say, card?

47:18.595 --> 47:22.759
Biggis hated to repeat hisself.

47:24.034 --> 47:25.524
Two weeks, man.

47:26.770 --> 47:27.862
You can keep the bag.

47:32.509 --> 47:34.636
Now, who the fuck these niggas
think they is?

47:34.711 --> 47:35.939
Man, fuck them...

47:36.013 --> 47:37.446
and fuck everybody.

47:37.514 --> 47:38.879
Matter of fact, fuck you.

47:38.949 --> 47:40.177
You know what, D?

47:40.250 --> 47:41.911
I'm gonna murder
one of them niggas right there.

47:41.985 --> 47:43.919
I'm gonna murder one of them
niggas right there.

47:43.987 --> 47:46.512
And just like that,
it was back on.

47:48.158 --> 47:50.888
Regardless how wild or crazy
my crew appeared...

47:50.961 --> 47:54.419
man, the one thing we always
knew how to do was hustling.

47:54.498 --> 47:56.932
So, Baby Boy, D-Nice,
and the Young Gunz...

47:57.000 --> 47:59.025
got all our people together...

47:59.102 --> 48:01.696
and once again,
we flooded the streets.

48:01.772 --> 48:04.502
I mean, everything was moving.

48:07.144 --> 48:10.272
1,000, 2,000, 3,000.

48:10.347 --> 48:11.439
Man, we back, nigga.

48:11.515 --> 48:14.313
They can't count us
the fuck out now.

48:14.384 --> 48:16.215
Yeah.

48:18.522 --> 48:20.490
This is what the fuck
I'm talking about. We back.

48:20.557 --> 48:23.754
Hey, yo,
you move the slowest shit.

48:23.827 --> 48:25.556
Get the fuck out of here, nigga.

48:25.629 --> 48:27.290
Getting this money is
what the fuck I'm doing, nigga.

48:27.364 --> 48:28.456
Hello?

48:28.532 --> 48:29.556
Loco, nigga.

48:29.633 --> 48:30.622
Yeah, I know who this is.
What's up?

48:30.701 --> 48:31.929
You got that bread next week?

48:32.002 --> 48:33.993
Next week?
Nigga, you can have it tonight.

48:34.071 --> 48:36.130
Matter of fact, wait till
tomorrow, El Poco Loco.

48:36.206 --> 48:37.434
This nigga funny as shit, man.

48:37.507 --> 48:39.975
- Clown ass.
- Yo, man, funny as shit, man.

48:40.043 --> 48:42.944
This is what I'm about to do.

48:43.013 --> 48:45.174
I'm goin' back to the block
and get some more of this money.

48:45.248 --> 48:47.045
This ain't no money, man.
This is their money.

48:47.117 --> 48:48.982
I need my money. Huh?

48:49.052 --> 48:51.247
- Where you going with that?
- What the fuck you mean?

48:51.321 --> 48:53.221
I see a nigga
with a hundred something grand.

48:53.290 --> 48:54.780
Nigga, you out
your rabid ass mind.

48:54.858 --> 48:56.291
Where y'all burners at?

48:56.360 --> 48:58.055
You know niggas got caught up,
had to toss them burners...

48:58.128 --> 49:00.619
- Cut it the fuck out, man.
- Are you serious?

49:00.697 --> 49:03.165
Beans was right.
His crew was true hustlers.

49:03.233 --> 49:07.135
Baby Boy told me he had
my 90 grand five days early.

49:08.939 --> 49:11.772
Apparently, El Plaga was
real happy when he heard that...

49:11.842 --> 49:14.504
but he still wanted me
to holler at the Dame nigga.

49:14.578 --> 49:16.637
I been in Philly for four years.

49:16.713 --> 49:19.546
I still ain't
want to meet this nigga.

49:19.616 --> 49:22.449
But El Plaga figured
if I hook up with him...

49:22.519 --> 49:24.817
then there'd be
no one standing in my way...

49:24.888 --> 49:27.686
so I paid Dame
a little visit at his spot.

49:37.734 --> 49:39.861
My name is Dame.

49:39.936 --> 49:41.961
My good friends call me...

49:42.806 --> 49:44.398
Dame.

49:44.808 --> 49:46.105
Some of my other friends
call me...

49:46.176 --> 49:48.406
Young Fresh to Death...

49:48.478 --> 49:50.105
'cause I love to pop tags.

49:50.180 --> 49:51.977
I'm the head of The Umbrella.

49:52.049 --> 49:55.018
If you ain't under it,
you're gonna get drenched.

49:55.085 --> 49:56.882
I came up on
the streets of New York.

49:56.953 --> 49:58.511
We were crack broke...

49:58.588 --> 50:01.056
not even a pair of decent kicks.

50:04.194 --> 50:06.788
Psych, I'll always be
fresh to death.

50:06.863 --> 50:09.161
You see, I got this problem.

50:09.232 --> 50:10.995
I'm addicted to getting money.

50:11.068 --> 50:12.433
I need all the dough.

50:12.502 --> 50:13.935
Some call me greedy.

50:14.004 --> 50:16.029
I call myself a cakeaholic.

50:16.106 --> 50:19.007
So I do all kind of things
to make all kind of money.

50:19.076 --> 50:21.840
You should already know
I'm a super duper big cat...

50:21.912 --> 50:23.106
so of course I pick up...

50:23.180 --> 50:24.511
about a hundred of them things
from the airport...

50:24.581 --> 50:25.878
and I do it in style.

50:25.949 --> 50:27.678
I got the baddest chick
on the planet...

50:27.751 --> 50:29.013
delivering it to me.

50:29.086 --> 50:31.554
She'll do anything I say...
a real soldier.

50:31.621 --> 50:33.350
I tell her what to do,
and she does it...

50:33.423 --> 50:34.822
no questions asked.

50:34.891 --> 50:36.222
She loves me to death.

50:36.293 --> 50:38.454
Hello? You going to make me
carry the bags by myself...

50:38.528 --> 50:40.291
all that way, motherfucker?

50:40.363 --> 50:43.594
First of all,
you promised me a G-4...

50:43.667 --> 50:45.134
not a Challenger.

50:45.202 --> 50:46.863
I might as well be flying coach.

50:46.937 --> 50:48.928
That's, like, a thousand dollar
fine right there.

50:50.240 --> 50:53.073
And second of all,
that freeze-dried food.

50:53.143 --> 50:54.474
You better be taking me
to Mr. Chow's...

50:54.544 --> 50:55.943
for some squab right now...

50:56.012 --> 50:57.479
because that shit
was disgusting.

50:58.648 --> 51:00.616
And by the way,
look at my boots.

51:00.684 --> 51:02.049
These are my favorite boots.

51:02.119 --> 51:03.347
I got water stains
on my boots...

51:03.420 --> 51:06.150
because that dumb ass
flight attendant...

51:06.223 --> 51:07.520
spilled Evian
all over my boots.

51:07.591 --> 51:10.151
That's two more grand
for the boots.

51:10.227 --> 51:13.287
You know what?
Step your game up a little bit.

51:13.363 --> 51:15.558
You're taking me shopping.

51:15.632 --> 51:19.534
Nice to see you, too.
Get the fuck in the car.

51:19.603 --> 51:22.595
Now, to the average dude,
that alone would be enough...

51:22.672 --> 51:24.572
but I'm not lazy.

51:24.641 --> 51:26.336
Tell them
I want my money by Tuesday.

51:26.409 --> 51:29.537
Like I told y'all,
I'm addicted to getting money.

51:29.613 --> 51:32.446
So, I hit a select few with
a couple of burns at a time...

51:32.516 --> 51:34.711
but also break them down
brick by brick.

51:34.784 --> 51:37.344
There's some key, halves.

51:37.420 --> 51:39.285
There's some quarters.
There's some eighths...

51:39.356 --> 51:41.620
ounces, half-ounces.

51:41.691 --> 51:42.817
I even cook
the shit up myself...

51:42.893 --> 51:44.827
because I got to get
all them extras.

51:44.895 --> 51:47.159
I chop it up, bottle it up.

51:47.230 --> 51:50.666
You see it, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

51:50.734 --> 51:53.828
Pass some dimes, nicks, tres...

51:53.904 --> 51:56.338
two for fives,
even two-dollar bottles.

51:56.406 --> 51:58.704
If I could,
I'd pitch them shits myself...

51:58.775 --> 52:00.868
but there's
only 24 hours in a day...

52:00.944 --> 52:03.071
and there's only one Dame.

52:03.146 --> 52:05.876
You see, I'm an executive,
a businessman.

52:05.949 --> 52:08.417
Some even call me a CEO.

52:08.485 --> 52:09.952
And in
my international quest...

52:10.020 --> 52:11.817
for greatness
and worldwide domination...

52:11.888 --> 52:13.355
you know
I couldn't do it alone...

52:13.423 --> 52:14.947
so I have a lot of ill crews...

52:15.025 --> 52:16.822
set up in
a lot of different places.

52:18.495 --> 52:20.656
Man, pull over.

52:21.865 --> 52:22.957
What the fuck is that?

52:23.033 --> 52:25.399
Now, the Dip Set
ran Harlem for me...

52:25.468 --> 52:27.265
bein' young Juelz Santana...

52:27.337 --> 52:28.395
What?

52:28.471 --> 52:31.463
Stupid.

52:31.541 --> 52:33.008
Jimmy Jones...

52:33.076 --> 52:35.306
He's buggin'.

52:35.378 --> 52:36.606
And the leader of that clique...

52:36.680 --> 52:37.647
Stupid.

52:37.714 --> 52:39.511
Cam'ron.

52:51.361 --> 52:52.953
And like
any good Harlem crew...

52:53.029 --> 52:55.293
they handled their business
with style and class...

52:55.365 --> 52:57.094
sophistication...

52:57.167 --> 53:00.568
and above all,
they were very subtle.

53:10.280 --> 53:11.304
Close the trunk.

53:11.381 --> 53:13.849
Oh, yeah.
Did I forget to mention...

53:13.917 --> 53:15.612
they had a love
for the color pink?

53:17.120 --> 53:19.645
And my crew up in Brooklyn
was called MOP...

53:19.723 --> 53:21.156
the Mash Out Posse.

53:21.224 --> 53:22.987
And they weren't
very sophisticated...

53:23.059 --> 53:24.617
but they got the job done.

53:30.133 --> 53:33.398
In Chicago, we had
different kind of hustlers.

53:33.470 --> 53:35.597
We had Kanye West
and the Kan-Men.

53:37.974 --> 53:40.374
Now, they did things
with a little more finesse...

53:40.443 --> 53:43.037
you know,
an intellectual approach.

53:52.589 --> 53:54.056
Here in the neighborhood...

53:54.124 --> 53:56.922
we called them
trendy, fashionable thugs.

53:58.061 --> 53:59.995
For a sting on
my international grisly...

54:00.063 --> 54:02.793
and in my quest for greatness
and worldwide domination...

54:02.866 --> 54:05.232
it only makes sense for my arms
to extend to the UK.

54:05.302 --> 54:07.736
I got with a crew called SAS.

54:07.804 --> 54:10.364
They did things the UK way.

54:10.440 --> 54:12.533
Hello? Who's this?

54:12.609 --> 54:15.134
Oh. Oh, yeah, that thing.

54:15.211 --> 54:17.179
Yeah, all right.

54:17.247 --> 54:18.373
Let's go.

54:22.319 --> 54:24.184
Hey! Stop!

54:37.000 --> 54:38.661
What's going on?

54:38.735 --> 54:40.225
Lovely weather we're havin'.

54:45.275 --> 54:48.244
And don't think just anybody
can get under this Umbrella.

54:48.311 --> 54:51.439
Number one, you got to be
a cakeaholic just like me...

54:51.514 --> 54:53.482
meaning
always stay on the grisly.

54:53.550 --> 54:56.110
And number two,
don't take any shit.

54:56.186 --> 54:58.154
Always be thorough.

54:58.221 --> 54:59.848
And number three,
I would suggest...

54:59.923 --> 55:02.323
you stay fresh to death
and always pop tag...

55:02.392 --> 55:04.656
because you will get teed.

55:07.397 --> 55:09.422
Yo, cabinet face,
get the fuck out of here.

55:09.499 --> 55:10.727
Look like... look like...

55:10.800 --> 55:12.791
Whoopi Goldberg
tongue kissed him.

55:12.869 --> 55:15.167
Yeah. She had
a seizure yesterday.

55:16.406 --> 55:20.308
Feel like a witch doctor
put a curse on him.

55:20.377 --> 55:24.746
He look like Michael Jackson
got blown up with a Pepsi.

55:24.814 --> 55:28.443
He look like Ziggy Marley's
little brother.

55:28.518 --> 55:30.315
Teddy Pendergrass' bodyguard.

55:30.387 --> 55:32.446
He look like
a Cabbage Patch voodoo doll.

55:32.522 --> 55:33.955
If you front with me
on anything...

55:34.023 --> 55:36.548
never take my light-heartedness
for weakness.

55:37.827 --> 55:40.227
Man, suck my dick.

55:41.965 --> 55:44.627
Don't worry. I can take a joke.

55:53.777 --> 55:56.507
Now you look like
a dead voodoo doll.

56:01.217 --> 56:04.448
So, anyway,
as I said before...

56:04.521 --> 56:06.455
I'm a cakeaholic.

56:06.523 --> 56:08.548
My crew's cakeaholic.

56:08.625 --> 56:11.458
We love to get money,
and we love to have fun.

56:11.528 --> 56:15.089
We don't take no shit,
and it's death before dishonor.

56:15.165 --> 56:16.860
Win by all costs.

56:16.933 --> 56:19.026
Be scared of no one.

56:19.102 --> 56:20.694
And that's the Umbrella.

56:20.770 --> 56:23.603
You're either under it,
or you're gonna get drenched.

56:23.673 --> 56:26.039
No ifs, ands, or buts about it.

56:26.109 --> 56:27.576
Holler.

56:29.646 --> 56:31.375
Hey, Big Figgitty.

56:31.448 --> 56:32.574
What up, Dame?

56:32.649 --> 56:34.014
You know my man Winky?

56:34.083 --> 56:35.607
Nah.

56:35.685 --> 56:36.947
He'll knock you the fuck out.

56:37.020 --> 56:38.487
You got to be
out your fucking mind.

56:38.555 --> 56:40.580
I'm 30 and 0
in the fucking street.

56:43.893 --> 56:46.555
So I paid Dame
a visit at his spot...

56:46.629 --> 56:49.757
told him who I was
and who I worked for.

56:49.833 --> 56:53.269
He played it cool, but
I could tell he was interested.

56:56.172 --> 56:58.640
El Pollo Loco.

56:58.708 --> 57:00.437
El Pollo Loco?

57:00.510 --> 57:03.035
El Pollo.
But it's all gravy, dad.

57:03.112 --> 57:04.545
I heard that.

57:04.614 --> 57:08.675
I work with El Plaga.
You figga deal me?

57:08.751 --> 57:10.343
El Plaga?

57:10.420 --> 57:12.081
Yeah, El Plaga.

57:12.155 --> 57:14.055
Old Slithery.

57:14.123 --> 57:16.717
That's a posito
on that jump-off.

57:16.793 --> 57:19.091
I really don't talk business
after 8:00.

57:19.162 --> 57:21.130
Yeah.

57:21.197 --> 57:23.461
Look like you jump off
after 8:00.

57:26.870 --> 57:30.772
Well, I'm with all that,
you fly motherfucker.

57:30.840 --> 57:34.173
Hey, we some fly bum-ass niggas.

57:34.244 --> 57:35.711
I'm going to get with you
another time.

57:35.778 --> 57:37.439
OK, my nigga.

57:37.514 --> 57:38.572
Tell Slithery.

57:38.648 --> 57:40.309
Use your peoples, too.

57:42.318 --> 57:44.616
Some Miami cat Loco...

57:44.687 --> 57:47.087
told me El Plaga could help me
take over Philly.

57:47.156 --> 57:49.852
I told him
I already had Philly.

57:49.926 --> 57:51.826
But then his man came back
the next day...

57:51.895 --> 57:54.591
with an offer
that did sound interesting.

57:54.664 --> 57:57.189
They got something
that belong to El Plaga.

57:57.267 --> 57:59.292
You get it back,
he'll give you other work.

57:59.369 --> 58:03.169
Know what I mean?
There's the address.

58:03.239 --> 58:04.797
So, let me get this straight.

58:04.874 --> 58:07.069
I'm going to send my boys
to pick that up for El Plaga...

58:07.143 --> 58:08.633
and your man going to give us
a hundred of them things...

58:08.711 --> 58:10.508
at 10,000 a clip?

58:10.580 --> 58:13.071
What the fuck I say, card?

58:18.521 --> 58:20.682
Don't open the package.

58:23.126 --> 58:24.525
You just going to let him
stare you down...

58:24.594 --> 58:26.585
like that, big man, huh?

58:29.165 --> 58:31.292
I was on my way
to meet the boy Loco...

58:31.367 --> 58:33.835
to give him his little 90...

58:33.903 --> 58:37.566
and you won't believe
what the fuck happened next.

58:48.051 --> 58:49.814
Man, get the fuck outta here!

58:49.886 --> 58:50.910
Ain't this a bitch?

58:50.987 --> 58:52.682
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
good evening.

58:52.755 --> 58:54.484
How y'all doing?

58:54.557 --> 58:55.581
You all right?

58:55.658 --> 58:56.784
Nigga, you serious?

58:56.859 --> 58:57.848
Think you gonna rob us
in a pink fuckin' robe?

58:57.927 --> 58:59.292
Nigga,

58:59.362 --> 59:01.125
A'ight, y'all.
Don't kill me tonight, fam.

59:01.197 --> 59:02.323
Do right.

59:02.398 --> 59:04.127
Give me the fucking bag.

59:04.200 --> 59:06.964
Give me the fucking bag,
George Jefferson.

59:07.036 --> 59:08.867
You gentlemen
have a good night, man.

59:08.938 --> 59:11.429
Give everybody my love
from the West U Crew, man.

59:11.507 --> 59:15.170
I'm gonna count this green money
in our pink SUV.

59:15.244 --> 59:16.939
Good night, gentlemen.

59:17.013 --> 59:18.378
Get the fuck outta here.

59:18.448 --> 59:21.110
A'ight. OK.

59:21.184 --> 59:23.948
Get the fuck outta here.
Get the fuck...

59:26.656 --> 59:28.783

59:28.858 --> 59:30.291

59:30.360 --> 59:31.554

59:31.628 --> 59:32.754
The whole 90, man!

59:32.829 --> 59:33.853
Y'all know
who the fuck it was?!

59:33.930 --> 59:34.897
Who was it?

59:34.964 --> 59:36.556
Them Harlem niggas
work for Dame.

59:36.633 --> 59:39.124
- How you know it was Dame?
- Nigga, how I know...

59:39.202 --> 59:41.397
Y'all see that pink fuckin'
robe flying around there?

59:41.471 --> 59:43.405

59:46.309 --> 59:48.300
Cool the fuck out, man.
You know damn well...

59:48.378 --> 59:50.573
we need to holler at Beans
before we do anything.

59:50.647 --> 59:52.012
Holler at Beans?!

59:52.081 --> 59:54.481
Beans got 15 to 30!
Nigga, what the fuck...

59:54.550 --> 59:56.040
We ain't gotta wait
for the nigga to come home.

59:56.119 --> 59:57.814
We can holler at him, see if
word came through the jail.

59:57.887 --> 59:59.514
Came through the...
Motherfucker, nigga is you...

59:59.589 --> 01:00:00.954

Listen, I got him.
Cool out. I got him.

01:00:20.243 --> 01:00:21.574
May I help you?

01:00:21.644 --> 01:00:23.771
- Collect.
- And your name?

01:00:23.846 --> 01:00:25.438
D-Nice and them
should have known better.

01:00:25.515 --> 01:00:26.846
Beans.

01:00:26.916 --> 01:00:29.851
I knew about Baby Boy's stick up
as soon as it happened.

01:00:29.919 --> 01:00:31.352
See, when you in here...

01:00:31.421 --> 01:00:33.013
you hear everything
that go on in the street.

01:00:33.089 --> 01:00:35.853
Sometimes even before
the street know.

01:00:35.925 --> 01:00:37.859
What the fi-diddy-duh?

01:00:37.927 --> 01:00:38.951
Collect call.

01:00:39.028 --> 01:00:40.495
- Collect call?
- Yes, from Beans.

01:00:40.563 --> 01:00:44.329
Beans? Hell, no,
I ain't accept no collect call.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.731
I ain't allowed to associate...

01:00:45.802 --> 01:00:48.498
with convicted fe-di-delons
anyway.

01:00:48.571 --> 01:00:50.300
Nigga.

01:00:50.373 --> 01:00:52.273
Better have my money.

01:00:52.341 --> 01:00:55.003
Now I got a beef with Loco...

01:00:55.078 --> 01:00:57.046
beef with whoever we robbed...

01:00:57.113 --> 01:00:59.047
I still had beef with Dame...

01:00:59.115 --> 01:01:03.017
beef inside my crew,
and 90 fuckin' grand missing.

01:01:03.086 --> 01:01:05.247
Whoa, slow your roll, fam.
This is Beans' phone.

01:01:05.321 --> 01:01:06.413
Damn, my bad, yo.

01:01:06.489 --> 01:01:08.252
Tryin' to call
my baby moms, man.

01:01:08.324 --> 01:01:11.054
Man, get the fuck
outta here, man.

01:01:13.563 --> 01:01:14.928
Faggot.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.932
Yeah, nigga.
Yeah, you know what it is.

01:01:20.002 --> 01:01:22.300
Come on, get up on here.

01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:24.066
You ain't packin'
that shit, nigga.

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:25.801
Huh? You ain't...
What's that?

01:01:25.875 --> 01:01:27.467
You got more money?
Oh, you a baller.

01:01:27.543 --> 01:01:30.103
Somebody callin'.
He gettin' robbed right now.

01:01:30.179 --> 01:01:31.476
Get your ass...

01:01:31.547 --> 01:01:33.481
When you down 90 grand

01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:35.380
what else you supposed to do?

01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:37.442
You rob.
You rob everything in sight.

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.181
No questions asked.

01:01:39.255 --> 01:01:41.849
Shit, that's what the fuck
I did best anyway.

01:01:45.128 --> 01:01:47.426
Shit, I was scrapin' up paper
on every block.

01:01:47.497 --> 01:01:49.692
36 hours straight.
I ain't get no rest.

01:01:49.766 --> 01:01:53.532
I had to get that 90 Gs up
or we was over.

01:02:02.645 --> 01:02:04.704
You dirty motherfuckers
bet somethin'.

01:02:04.847 --> 01:02:06.781
- What y'all bettin'?
- 290.

01:02:06.849 --> 01:02:09.147
Even your man
Mr. Calm, Cool, and Collected...

01:02:09.218 --> 01:02:11.277
D-Nice was bugging out.

01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:14.950
He caught himself getting back
rollin' dice...

01:02:15.024 --> 01:02:18.084
he ended up losing his cool
a little bit.

01:02:18.161 --> 01:02:20.220
Here's your number, nigga.

01:02:24.834 --> 01:02:28.668
Shit, owing niggas money

01:02:28.738 --> 01:02:31.298
Young is there smokin' that
g-spicer all motherfuckin' day?

01:02:31.374 --> 01:02:32.807
Like we don't owe nobody
no paper, huh?

01:02:32.875 --> 01:02:34.274
That nigga's crazy, man.

01:02:34.343 --> 01:02:36.208
How much is that?

01:02:36.279 --> 01:02:38.543
'Scuse me,
it's about 9 grand I brought.

01:02:38.614 --> 01:02:40.081
Nigga, that ain't shit!

01:02:40.149 --> 01:02:42.811
While you been out stickin' up

01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:44.682

01:02:44.754 --> 01:02:47.018
He ain't never lied.
Doin' all our homework.

01:02:47.089 --> 01:02:48.556
Takin' down

01:02:55.131 --> 01:02:56.996
That nigga's funny as shit.

01:02:57.066 --> 01:02:58.124
Oh, look...

01:02:59.502 --> 01:03:00.469
Hello?

01:03:00.536 --> 01:03:04.131
Loco.
Have my bread in 15 flat.

01:03:04.207 --> 01:03:06.767
- A'ight?
- Yeah, a'ight.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:10.470
Pollo Loco still want his paper.

01:03:10.546 --> 01:03:12.207
He say we got 15 hours.

01:03:12.281 --> 01:03:14.112
See, as far as
I was concerned...

01:03:14.183 --> 01:03:16.674
that nigga Loco was doing us
dirty the whole time.

01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:19.312
Didn't matter.
I'm-a kill him anyway.

01:03:22.458 --> 01:03:23.618
What happened?

01:03:25.328 --> 01:03:27.990
I don't know, my man.

01:03:29.365 --> 01:03:32.766
He supposed to get you out.

01:03:32.835 --> 01:03:34.268
He's supposed to...

01:03:34.337 --> 01:03:37.966
but my lawyers, man,
we ain't heard shit.

01:03:39.475 --> 01:03:42.774
Now, Beans, you know
you can't trust no lawyers.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:47.374
Man, all that shit
bullshit, man.

01:03:49.685 --> 01:03:51.710
Yo, you think
that nigga El Plaga...

01:03:51.787 --> 01:03:53.379
really got it like that?

01:03:53.456 --> 01:03:55.048
I know he do.

01:03:58.494 --> 01:04:01.657
Why you still in here, man?

01:04:01.731 --> 01:04:03.892
You used to work for
that motherfucker.

01:04:03.966 --> 01:04:06.298
If he wanted me out,
I'd be out.

01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:09.668
When I was runnin' with Loco,
ain't nobody fuck with us.

01:04:13.643 --> 01:04:16.305
But somebody set
y'all the fuck up, though.

01:04:16.379 --> 01:04:19.780
And whoever that was,
I pray for him.

01:04:19.849 --> 01:04:21.578
Man, this nigga act like...

01:04:21.651 --> 01:04:23.551
El Plaga really got it
like that.

01:04:23.619 --> 01:04:26.281
"And if he wanted me out,
I'd be out."

01:04:26.355 --> 01:04:29.085
And this nigga layin' up
in here with me.

01:04:32.895 --> 01:04:34.055
But you know what?

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:37.497
The very next day,
my lawyer came to holler at me.

01:04:39.001 --> 01:04:42.596
He told me that the D.A.
That prosecuted me...

01:04:42.672 --> 01:04:46.073
and the judge was disbarred
for accepting payoff money.

01:04:46.142 --> 01:04:48.633
Now, how fucking crazy is that?

01:04:51.948 --> 01:04:54.075
And just like that, I was out.

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:57.745
Man, they opened up those gates
and I was gone.

01:04:59.221 --> 01:05:03.248
They didn't give me no P.O.,
no house arrest, no monitor.

01:05:03.326 --> 01:05:05.726
None of that shit.

01:05:05.795 --> 01:05:07.660
That was good money, too.

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:09.857
'Cause with all the bullshit
that was going on...

01:05:09.932 --> 01:05:12.162
with my crew
and Loco and them...

01:05:12.234 --> 01:05:14.634
shit, I had to make moves...

01:05:14.704 --> 01:05:16.569
and I had to do it myself.

01:05:16.639 --> 01:05:18.300
'Cause it was
about to go down...

01:05:18.374 --> 01:05:21.537
and I knew the only one
that could fix it was me.

01:05:29.685 --> 01:05:32.916
What's 2 plus 2?

01:05:32.989 --> 01:05:34.251
Four.

01:05:34.323 --> 01:05:35.381
Good girl!

01:05:38.327 --> 01:05:39.988
Hold on a second.

01:05:42.098 --> 01:05:43.622
What are you calling me
for today?

01:05:43.699 --> 01:05:44.859
Don't you know
it's Daddy-Daughter Day?

01:05:44.934 --> 01:05:47.368
Meet me at the spot.
I'll explain.

01:05:47.436 --> 01:05:48.596
Call your people, man.

01:05:48.671 --> 01:05:50.070
All right,
let me get this straight...

01:05:52.475 --> 01:05:54.102
Don't even try, guy.

01:05:54.176 --> 01:05:56.406
All right, all right. Later.

01:05:58.547 --> 01:06:01.641
What's 1 plus 1?

01:06:01.717 --> 01:06:02.843
Two.

01:06:04.086 --> 01:06:05.986
Now, being that I did
that thing for El Plaga...

01:06:06.055 --> 01:06:08.615
you know, got him back
his little 90...

01:06:08.691 --> 01:06:10.420
I mean,
I could have gave him that.

01:06:10.493 --> 01:06:12.017
I was just waiting for them...

01:06:12.094 --> 01:06:13.857
to tell me
where to pick up my work.

01:06:13.929 --> 01:06:15.954
And then your man Biggis
calls me...

01:06:16.032 --> 01:06:18.091
and tells me
to meet him at 5 A.M.

01:06:18.167 --> 01:06:21.193
I mean, something about this
just doesn't sit right with me.

01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:22.396
Hey, listen, do me a favor.

01:06:22.471 --> 01:06:23.961
Meet me around the corner
about 25 minutes.

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.803
You're not taking
your jacket, boss?

01:06:25.875 --> 01:06:28.708
No. Thanks, though.
He's a great driver.

01:06:28.778 --> 01:06:30.268
Great drivers are hard
to find these days.

01:06:30.346 --> 01:06:32.246
I mean, this shit just seemed
a little fishy to me.

01:06:32.314 --> 01:06:34.714
The math just wasn't adding up.

01:06:34.784 --> 01:06:36.308
So I do what I always do.

01:06:36.385 --> 01:06:38.114
Surrounded myself
with some people I respect...

01:06:38.187 --> 01:06:40.712
on an intellectual level,
of course...

01:06:40.790 --> 01:06:42.223
went down to the club...

01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:45.192
drank a little Armadil,
and kicked it with my crew.

01:06:52.268 --> 01:06:56.261
Nicole Wray,
look how cute you are.

01:06:56.338 --> 01:06:58.568
What do I gotta do
to get you to sing for me?

01:06:58.641 --> 01:07:01.109
I'll sing
a little later, a'ight?

01:07:01.177 --> 01:07:03.008
I'll get back at you.

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:08.678
Why don't y'all get a drink?

01:07:08.751 --> 01:07:09.945
I'll be over there in a minute.

01:07:10.019 --> 01:07:11.008
I'm gonna go talk to my crew.

01:07:11.087 --> 01:07:12.281
All right.

01:07:19.295 --> 01:07:21.126
Don't touch me in public.

01:07:21.197 --> 01:07:23.495
You know, lately,
I been buggin' out.

01:07:23.566 --> 01:07:26.592
You know, all I can think about
is getting money.

01:07:26.669 --> 01:07:29.763
I mean, I think
I gotta see my therapist.

01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:32.967
At first, I wanted
to be a millionaire...

01:07:33.042 --> 01:07:35.203
and I did that 10 years ago.

01:07:35.277 --> 01:07:37.472
Then I felt like
I wanted to be a billionaire...

01:07:37.546 --> 01:07:39.275
and I could see the light...

01:07:39.348 --> 01:07:42.249
but now I think I want to be
a quarter of a trillionaire.

01:07:42.318 --> 01:07:44.286
You know what that is?

01:07:44.353 --> 01:07:47.083
That's $250 billion.

01:07:47.156 --> 01:07:48.885
I'm sittin' at the table...

01:07:48.958 --> 01:07:50.949
kickin' it with my crew,
talking about the only thing...

01:07:51.026 --> 01:07:54.325
interesting more than myself,
which, of course, be my money...

01:07:54.396 --> 01:07:56.125
and my international quest
for greatness...

01:07:56.198 --> 01:07:57.722
but sometimes
when I start talking about...

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.860
myself and my money,
my mind starts to wander.

01:08:01.437 --> 01:08:02.665
You think I'm cute?

01:08:02.738 --> 01:08:04.069
You're adorable.

01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.664
And then
I start doing the math...

01:08:05.741 --> 01:08:07.436
for these series of events
that just happened.

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:09.808
This shit's
just not making sense.

01:08:09.879 --> 01:08:11.847
Do you mind if I see your feet?

01:08:11.914 --> 01:08:13.711
You can see hers.

01:08:13.782 --> 01:08:15.215
Fuck!

01:08:15.284 --> 01:08:17.309
First, I had
this really important meeting...

01:08:17.386 --> 01:08:19.377
interrupted by some bullshit.

01:08:19.455 --> 01:08:20.546
What?

01:08:20.622 --> 01:08:22.352
Yo, Dame, we got robbed.

01:08:22.424 --> 01:08:25.916
What? What do you mean
we got robbed?

01:08:25.995 --> 01:08:27.587
And they took my money?

01:08:27.662 --> 01:08:28.993
Nah. The work in the bathroom.

01:08:29.064 --> 01:08:31.464
All right.
I'll be down there in a minute.

01:08:32.468 --> 01:08:33.799
Carlos wimped.

01:08:33.868 --> 01:08:35.837
See, the first thing
that was buggin' me out was...

01:08:35.904 --> 01:08:37.895
I don't get robbed.
Trust me.

01:08:37.973 --> 01:08:39.837
Then this guy Loco shows up
outta nowhere...

01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:41.671
talkin' shit like
he's somebody I need to know.

01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:44.076
El Pollo Loco.

01:08:44.145 --> 01:08:45.374
El Pollo Loco?

01:08:45.447 --> 01:08:47.471
El Pollo,
but it's all gravy, dad.

01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:49.779
Whatever.

01:08:49.852 --> 01:08:51.444
The next day his man
comes to my place of business...

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.215
and offers me all kinds of work.

01:08:53.288 --> 01:08:54.551
I give you the work,
know what I mean?

01:08:54.622 --> 01:08:57.216
Was it real?
Should I even consider it?

01:08:57.292 --> 01:08:58.317
I don't know.

01:08:58.394 --> 01:08:59.691
Just let me get this straight.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:01.787
I'm gonna send my boys
to pick it up for El Plaga.

01:09:01.863 --> 01:09:02.990
And your man gonna give us
100 of them things...

01:09:03.064 --> 01:09:04.122
at 10,000 a clip?

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.566
Can a kid afford to turn
all this money down?

01:09:06.635 --> 01:09:08.261
I don't think so.

01:09:08.337 --> 01:09:10.066
So I did a think-through.

01:09:10.139 --> 01:09:12.573
I didn't really like the way
the Biggis nigga spoke.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.631
He was one disrespectful
motherfucker.

01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:15.801
What are you
calling me for today?

01:09:15.877 --> 01:09:16.935
Don't you know
it's Daddy-Daughter Day?

01:09:17.011 --> 01:09:18.240
Meet me at the spot.

01:09:18.314 --> 01:09:20.782
I mean, the 5 A.M. Drop-offs
ain't really my steeze...

01:09:20.849 --> 01:09:22.247
but whatever to that.

01:09:22.318 --> 01:09:24.843
This whole situation is startin'
to fuck with my emotions...

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.218
and y'all know I hate
an emotional roller coaster.

01:09:27.288 --> 01:09:28.620
I put too much money...

01:09:28.691 --> 01:09:30.090
into therapy and
anger management for this shit.

01:09:30.158 --> 01:09:31.421
Real fishy shit is going on.

01:09:31.493 --> 01:09:33.984
I mean, they told me
that if we did that thing...

01:09:34.063 --> 01:09:35.689
you know, that thing
you did for me, Jimmy...

01:09:35.764 --> 01:09:37.060
you and Cam?

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.828
You know,
Jimmy did that thing...

01:09:39.902 --> 01:09:43.269
they'd give me
100 of them things at 10 a pop.

01:09:43.339 --> 01:09:44.670
It sounds
too good to be true...

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:46.332
but, you know,
I gotta chase that.

01:09:46.408 --> 01:09:47.841
I gotta get that money.

01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:49.604
But they might be
comin' through...

01:09:49.678 --> 01:09:52.977
'cause I don't like
my emotions fucked with.

01:09:53.048 --> 01:09:55.915
So I'm gonna go check them
niggas out.

01:09:55.985 --> 01:09:58.783
Anything look strange,
just fire. Fuck that.

01:09:58.854 --> 01:10:01.379
Remember what we did
with the ABM.

01:10:01.457 --> 01:10:02.651
That was fun.

01:10:02.725 --> 01:10:05.660
So, I just need
y'all to watch my back...

01:10:05.728 --> 01:10:07.753
for a quick second.

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:12.233
Just watch out. 'Scuse me.

01:10:21.644 --> 01:10:23.271
Shit. I forgot somethin'.

01:10:28.417 --> 01:10:30.544
You know, I really don't mind
if y'all touch me in the club...

01:10:30.619 --> 01:10:32.143
but, you know,
for your own protection...

01:10:32.221 --> 01:10:34.018
you know, girls get jealous,
they want to fight...

01:10:34.089 --> 01:10:35.681
fuck our night up.
Know what I mean?

01:10:35.758 --> 01:10:36.850
Follow me, girls.

01:10:36.925 --> 01:10:38.586
Oh, my God!

01:10:38.661 --> 01:10:42.563
Come on, man.
Some nigga shot my driver?

01:10:42.631 --> 01:10:44.292
I must be on "Punk'd"
or somethin'.

01:10:44.366 --> 01:10:45.492
Nigga shot my driver?

01:10:45.567 --> 01:10:47.865
What kind of sick, demented,
twisted, motherfucker...

01:10:47.936 --> 01:10:49.198
shoots a driver?

01:10:49.271 --> 01:10:51.569
What kind of nigga
shoots a driver?

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:53.835
I might've been confused before.

01:10:53.909 --> 01:10:56.104
Now I'm confused and pissed.

01:10:56.178 --> 01:10:57.702
Aw, man.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.873
I been in plenty of beefs
and made lots of enemies...

01:10:59.948 --> 01:11:01.347
Sick motherfuckers
in this world.

01:11:01.417 --> 01:11:03.510
But far as I knew,
there's only one motherfucker...

01:11:03.585 --> 01:11:05.746
that hated me like this.

01:11:05.821 --> 01:11:08.255
Left me a note with it.

01:11:08.324 --> 01:11:09.757
"First of all...

01:11:09.825 --> 01:11:12.225
"I want to apologize for being
out of touch for so long.

01:11:12.294 --> 01:11:15.229
"These past few years of my life
have been real fucked up.

01:11:15.297 --> 01:11:18.027
"But you probably
already know that by now.

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.897
"See, man, fuckin' with you...

01:11:19.968 --> 01:11:22.163
"I lost almost everything.

01:11:22.237 --> 01:11:24.228
"Anyway, I'm sorry I left.

01:11:24.373 --> 01:11:27.206
"For what it's worth,
I think about you every day.

01:11:27.276 --> 01:11:29.676
"All I want to do
is see you die.

01:11:29.745 --> 01:11:31.736
"You can understand that, right?

01:11:31.814 --> 01:11:34.408
"But here's the best part,
so pay attention.

01:11:34.483 --> 01:11:37.782
"'Cause if you're readin' this,
it can only mean one thing.

01:11:37.853 --> 01:11:39.684
"I'm out."

01:11:39.755 --> 01:11:42.519
As soon as I got out,
I called D-Nice.

01:11:42.591 --> 01:11:45.685
Told him to have the whole crew
waitin' for me at the spot.

01:11:45.761 --> 01:11:47.888
We had a lot of shit
to clean up...

01:11:47.963 --> 01:11:49.931
and we had to do it fast.

01:11:49.998 --> 01:11:51.431
But first...

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.593
I had a very important meeting
to take care of.

01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:55.660
- Daddy!
- Hey!

01:11:59.975 --> 01:12:01.442
Where your mommy at?

01:12:08.384 --> 01:12:09.373
Yo, he get out?

01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:12.477
Yeah. He went to go see
his daughter.

01:12:12.554 --> 01:12:16.320
Then gonna see his P.O.,

01:12:16.392 --> 01:12:20.021
Won't be back for a while, man.

01:12:20.095 --> 01:12:23.258
What time we gonna meet
the hyper funny nigga?

01:12:23.332 --> 01:12:25.630

01:12:25.701 --> 01:12:29.728

Yeah, I'm all right.

01:12:38.313 --> 01:12:40.645
I know the motherfuckers

01:12:40.716 --> 01:12:41.808
Yeah.

01:12:41.884 --> 01:12:43.010
Tired of sittin' around waitin'.

01:12:43.085 --> 01:12:44.609
I don't know how Biggis does it.

01:12:44.686 --> 01:12:47.814
I'm sittin' here losing sleep
off the money we owe El Plaga...

01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:50.415
and he's playing with
video games.

01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:52.483
It's like nothin' ever
got to Biggis.

01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:54.426
He was always too cool.

01:12:56.131 --> 01:12:58.429
I gotta crawl up out

01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.694

Y'all want to get some grub?

01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:04.764
At this point,
I didn't give a fuck who I shot.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.967
I was squattin' outside
Dame's spot...

01:13:07.042 --> 01:13:08.839
waitin' for anybody
to come the fuck out.

01:13:08.911 --> 01:13:11.277
Far as I was concerned, all
them pussies owed me money...

01:13:11.346 --> 01:13:12.472
and whoever came out...

01:13:12.548 --> 01:13:14.812
I was gonna give
them niggas the business.

01:13:14.883 --> 01:13:16.282
I'll kill these motherfuckers.

01:13:19.922 --> 01:13:21.890
What you doin', man?
Chill out, motherfucker.

01:13:21.957 --> 01:13:23.424

01:14:23.318 --> 01:14:25.809
This shit's a fucking zoo.

01:14:25.888 --> 01:14:28.083
Throw that shit away, man.

01:14:28.156 --> 01:14:30.522

Both of them niggas

01:14:34.062 --> 01:14:36.860
Yeah, Baby Boy,
he real, real fucked up.

01:14:36.932 --> 01:14:38.763
D-Nice just went looking
for his lil' ass.

01:14:38.834 --> 01:14:40.426
Supposedly went to Dame club.

01:14:40.502 --> 01:14:42.265
Dame club?

01:14:42.337 --> 01:14:44.271
And that nigga Loco
keep calling on some shit.

01:14:44.339 --> 01:14:45.567
We supposed to meet him at 5:00.

01:14:45.641 --> 01:14:47.541
I don't know what's up.

01:14:47.609 --> 01:14:50.077
Y'all niggas is crazy, man.

01:14:50.145 --> 01:14:52.841
This shit fuckin' nasty

01:14:52.915 --> 01:14:55.679
Like a real fucking crack house.

01:14:59.588 --> 01:15:01.385
What the fuck is this?

01:15:01.456 --> 01:15:02.650
That's the work.

01:15:02.724 --> 01:15:03.952
The work?

01:15:04.026 --> 01:15:06.119
Your boy Pollo put us
on the job.

01:15:06.194 --> 01:15:08.754
We robbed the niggas, and
they got us selling the shit.

01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:10.297
We thought you sent work.

01:15:10.365 --> 01:15:12.833
Pollo?

01:15:12.901 --> 01:15:15.734
And then it all started
to make sense.

01:15:15.804 --> 01:15:18.364
El Plaga was right about
Philly's untapped potential.

01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.637
Loco was setting me up
from day one.

01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:23.371
Shut that motherfucker

01:15:23.445 --> 01:15:25.413
He was playing me
like a PS-2.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.414
I think we could do something
to work that out.

01:15:27.482 --> 01:15:28.449
Yeah?

01:15:28.517 --> 01:15:30.382
I told you,
El Plaga ain't no joke.

01:15:30.452 --> 01:15:31.510
Loco?

01:15:31.587 --> 01:15:33.214
Loco. Pollo.

01:15:33.288 --> 01:15:35.085

01:15:35.157 --> 01:15:37.352

01:15:39.728 --> 01:15:41.423

01:17:01.043 --> 01:17:02.476
Close it.

01:17:03.712 --> 01:17:06.613
You know, you

01:17:06.682 --> 01:17:07.944
Don't you know

01:17:08.016 --> 01:17:09.449
I had three bitches with me.

01:17:09.518 --> 01:17:11.008
You think I'm scared
of that husky shit?

01:17:11.086 --> 01:17:13.145
The only thing stopping me from
blowing your fucking brains out

01:17:13.221 --> 01:17:14.620
is my anger management.

01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:16.021

01:17:16.091 --> 01:17:18.423

01:21:52.033 --> 01:21:55.298
Beans, I could blow
your fucking head off right now.

01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:57.065
You do know this, don't you?

01:21:58.606 --> 01:22:00.904
Yeah, all right, nigga.
I wish you would.

01:22:00.976 --> 01:22:02.967
I'm going to take care
of this Loco motherfucker...

01:22:03.044 --> 01:22:05.569
then we'll see what's up.

01:22:06.815 --> 01:22:07.782
Aw!

01:22:07.849 --> 01:22:08.873
Aw, shit, man. You hit, man.

01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:10.508
Come on, we got to get
the fuck up outta here.

01:22:10.585 --> 01:22:12.951
Come on.

01:22:15.557 --> 01:22:18.856
Shot after shot,
clip after clip...

01:22:18.927 --> 01:22:20.690
and not a cop in sight.

01:22:20.762 --> 01:22:23.458
This shit
makes no fucking sense.

01:22:31.539 --> 01:22:34.030
Yo. Put him in the car...

01:22:34.109 --> 01:22:35.576
and meet me around the corner
in five minutes.

01:22:35.643 --> 01:22:38.271
He gonna be all right.
It's a flesh wound.

01:22:41.483 --> 01:22:42.882
You knew
I could've had you, right?

01:22:42.951 --> 01:22:43.918
You couldn't have had shit.

01:22:43.985 --> 01:22:45.247
Yeah, I could've had you.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.446
Fuck!

01:22:50.692 --> 01:22:51.852
Beans, what the fuck, nigga?

01:22:51.926 --> 01:22:54.190
You shootin' at me?!
You're a maniac!

01:22:54.262 --> 01:22:57.060
Then why the fuck you set me up
all this time, man?

01:22:57.132 --> 01:22:59.362
- You fucking snake!
- Who the snake?

01:22:59.434 --> 01:23:02.597
What the fuck type nigga
I look like settin' you up?

01:23:02.670 --> 01:23:04.262
Nigga, if you wanted
to see me, nigga...

01:23:04.339 --> 01:23:05.601
you could've seen me in jail!

01:23:05.673 --> 01:23:08.198
No way!
If I wanted to see you...

01:23:08.276 --> 01:23:09.971
I would've got you in jail,
nigga!

01:23:10.045 --> 01:23:11.512
I'd be there like you!

01:23:11.579 --> 01:23:13.547
Instead of
fucking passing it to you!

01:23:13.615 --> 01:23:16.778
Nigga, you ain't gangsta, nigga!
You's a bitch!

01:23:16.851 --> 01:23:18.284
Nigga, I was born gangsta...

01:23:18.353 --> 01:23:20.287
and you set me the fuck up, man.

01:23:20.355 --> 01:23:21.617
El Plaga!

01:23:21.689 --> 01:23:23.281
That's El Plaga?

01:23:24.459 --> 01:23:26.893
I ain't fucking El Plaga, nigga!

01:23:26.961 --> 01:23:29.555
I know there ain't
no fucking El Plaga, man.

01:23:29.631 --> 01:23:31.656
You don't think
I know who work we robbed...

01:23:31.733 --> 01:23:33.894
the nigga ass Umbrella?

01:23:33.968 --> 01:23:37.062
You got us going at each other
so you can take over, huh?

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.474
They thought I was El Plaga?

01:23:40.542 --> 01:23:42.703
I never even met El Plaga.

01:23:42.777 --> 01:23:44.210
Well, what them niggas
talking about?

01:23:44.279 --> 01:23:47.009
Unless he was always around
the whole fucking time.

01:23:47.082 --> 01:23:48.674
Yo, Papi, dead that shit, man.

01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:49.717
Who work was it, yo?

01:23:49.784 --> 01:23:50.773
Who work was it?

01:23:50.852 --> 01:23:52.251
Who you think hooked up
you and Beans?

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.651
You wanted a connect in Philly?

01:23:53.721 --> 01:23:56.189
At that moment, in-between
bullets flying past my melon...

01:23:56.257 --> 01:23:58.122
I started to see
the whole picture.

01:23:58.393 --> 01:24:00.759
It was Biggis. It had to be.

01:24:00.829 --> 01:24:03.229
He was pulling the strings
since I was locked up.

01:24:03.298 --> 01:24:05.027
He probably got
me and Beans together...

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:06.397
in the first place.

01:24:07.435 --> 01:24:08.595
He planned it from day one.

01:24:08.670 --> 01:24:11.605
The motherfucker set
that shit up from the inside.

01:24:11.673 --> 01:24:13.664
I need you to do me
another favor.

01:24:13.741 --> 01:24:14.708
It's for a friend of mine.

01:24:14.776 --> 01:24:16.710
You heard of El Plaga, right?

01:24:17.946 --> 01:24:21.177
They call him Beans.
You know him?

01:24:21.249 --> 01:24:23.149
Fuck him. Whatever you need.

01:24:23.218 --> 01:24:24.879
Good.

01:24:24.953 --> 01:24:26.716
Here's what I need you to do.

01:24:27.956 --> 01:24:31.448
Yeah. Biggis was slick.
Fucking devious.

01:24:31.526 --> 01:24:34.689
Tell your boy if his guy
does that thing...

01:24:34.762 --> 01:24:35.956
we'll have him out
by the end of the month.

01:24:36.030 --> 01:24:38.055
All right, then.
I'm going to let Salaam know.

01:24:38.133 --> 01:24:39.430
I'm sure he'll be happy.

01:24:39.501 --> 01:24:41.128
Ever since
I got out the "P" now...

01:24:41.202 --> 01:24:43.762
Biggis has been trying
to get me to start a war.

01:24:43.838 --> 01:24:45.567
With Beans and Dame
out of the game...

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.074
he could take over
the whole fucking city.

01:24:52.347 --> 01:24:54.315
It's not just me he was using...

01:24:54.382 --> 01:24:56.077
Beans and Dame, too...

01:24:56.151 --> 01:24:58.949
playing us all.

01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:01.648
Biggis always said there was
a lot of work in Philly.

01:25:01.723 --> 01:25:03.714
Who fucking work was it, yo?

01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:05.224
They gonna come to me...

01:25:05.293 --> 01:25:07.420
with some Dame
and Umbrella type of shit?

01:25:07.495 --> 01:25:10.055
Fuck that, nigga. I raised you.

01:25:10.131 --> 01:25:11.393
You're like my son.

01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:17.668
I never told him
about the Umbrella...

01:25:17.739 --> 01:25:20.139
and I never knew the drugs
at the burger spot...

01:25:20.208 --> 01:25:21.505
belonged to Dame.

01:25:21.576 --> 01:25:23.544
Biggis told me
it was El Plaga's shit...

01:25:23.611 --> 01:25:25.374
and we were taking it back.

01:25:25.446 --> 01:25:27.846
How far back did this shit go?

01:25:27.916 --> 01:25:29.679
Was it at the botanica
with Freeway?

01:25:29.751 --> 01:25:31.218
Let me get this straight.

01:25:31.286 --> 01:25:33.811
The drugs are in the statue?

01:25:35.323 --> 01:25:36.688
What the fuck I just say, dawg?

01:25:36.758 --> 01:25:37.952
Don't worry about it.

01:25:38.026 --> 01:25:40.824
Did this shit start on my easy
with the Tuesday bitch?

01:25:40.895 --> 01:25:43.989
Have fun in prison,
you stupid motherfucker.

01:25:46.134 --> 01:25:48.227
You happy? I said it.

01:25:48.303 --> 01:25:49.895
Shut the fuck up.

01:25:49.971 --> 01:25:52.838
Does this shit go back
even further than that?

01:25:56.844 --> 01:26:00.336
He was using me
my whole fucking life.

01:26:12.894 --> 01:26:14.862
El Plaga.

01:26:21.703 --> 01:26:23.295
You hear that?

01:26:23.371 --> 01:26:24.463
You hear that?

01:26:24.539 --> 01:26:25.972
I think we should get
the fuck out of here.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.770
I ain't waiting here, man.

01:26:28.843 --> 01:26:30.936
Can you give me
a lift to my car?

01:26:31.012 --> 01:26:33.139
I'm kind of around the corner.

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.679
They should pull up any second.
We wait right here.

01:26:40.755 --> 01:26:41.881
All right.

01:26:45.693 --> 01:26:46.819
Holler at me, man.

01:26:46.894 --> 01:26:47.986
Yo, what's up?

01:26:48.062 --> 01:26:49.120
I ain't seen you, Jack.
You good?

01:26:49.197 --> 01:26:50.721
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good,
I'm good.

01:26:50.798 --> 01:26:51.958
What's up with Chris?
He all right?

01:26:52.033 --> 01:26:54.160
Nah, man, he good, man.
He only took a leg shot, man.

01:26:54.235 --> 01:26:55.532
All right.

01:26:55.603 --> 01:26:57.093
What's up with them niggas
Dame and them?

01:26:57.171 --> 01:26:58.297
Man, that shit was crazy, man.

01:26:58.373 --> 01:26:59.465
We all shooting
at the same fucking thing.

01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.269
Yeah. The nigga right here.

01:27:01.342 --> 01:27:02.809
He right there with you
right now?

01:27:02.877 --> 01:27:04.572
- He right here with me.
- Man, cut it the fuck out, man.

01:27:04.646 --> 01:27:06.841
He in the car with me,
no bullshit.

01:27:06.914 --> 01:27:08.814
Man, let me speak
to the nigga, then, man.

01:27:08.883 --> 01:27:10.680
Yo, say something to my man.

01:27:10.752 --> 01:27:12.117
Tell him I said, "What's up?"

01:27:13.421 --> 01:27:14.854
Man, you's a funny nigga, bull.

01:27:14.922 --> 01:27:16.583
Yeah, that's
my new best friend, man.

01:27:16.658 --> 01:27:17.852
For real, though?

01:27:17.925 --> 01:27:19.552
Yeah, everything's good.

01:27:19.627 --> 01:27:21.822
- Hey, you know what?
- What's up?

01:27:21.896 --> 01:27:23.955
I'm thinking
we should throw him a party.

01:27:24.032 --> 01:27:25.966
- Seriously?
- Something crazy.

01:27:26.034 --> 01:27:28.002
Yeah, an extravaganza.
Bananas.

01:27:28.069 --> 01:27:30.037
Straight up.

01:27:30.104 --> 01:27:33.096
We should throw him
a surprise party.

01:27:40.014 --> 01:27:41.948
They going to do a number...

01:27:42.016 --> 01:27:44.314
They showed
the both of us, I guess.

01:27:48.089 --> 01:27:49.420
This is my personal...

01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:50.650
Hello?

01:27:53.795 --> 01:27:55.092
Motherfucker,
let's go shopping.

01:27:56.397 --> 01:27:58.058
Don't stop and talk
to no boys, OK?

01:28:01.135 --> 01:28:02.329
Be good, all right?

01:28:07.508 --> 01:28:09.305
Now, what should I do
with y'all little...

01:28:09.377 --> 01:28:12.141
Now, what should I do
with y'all little...

01:28:12.213 --> 01:28:14.647
Now, what should I do with
y'all little greasy asses?

01:28:20.088 --> 01:28:21.180
Go crazy.

01:28:25.293 --> 01:28:27.921
I ain't supposed to be laughing.

01:28:27.995 --> 01:28:29.622
I don't even understand
that shit you...

01:28:40.041 --> 01:28:41.440
Shit like that.

01:28:41.509 --> 01:28:43.670
Yeah, baby doll.

01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:48.408
From the heart... la corazon.

01:28:56.190 --> 01:28:57.282
Yo, Fanlan.

01:28:57.358 --> 01:28:59.326
Yeah. Yeah, hold on, man.

01:29:02.397 --> 01:29:04.228
Hold on. Stop everything.
I forgot.

01:29:04.298 --> 01:29:05.390
What are we doing again?

01:29:17.712 --> 01:29:19.304
Here's your chips, baby!
Yeah!

01:29:30.491 --> 01:29:32.186
Oh, no.

01:29:36.297 --> 01:29:37.662
Sorry. Cut.

01:29:37.732 --> 01:29:40.200
Do both of us or just Juelz?
I'm sorry.

01:29:54.916 --> 01:29:56.611
He'll knock you the fuck out.

01:29:59.687 --> 01:30:00.711
Cut.
