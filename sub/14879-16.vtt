WEBVTT

00:01.998 --> 00:03.298
I'm Parker.

00:03.366 --> 00:04.299
Peace Corps
is incredibly selective.

00:04.367 --> 00:05.801
Eritrea?

00:05.868 --> 00:07.506
Can't you just
be happy for me?

00:07.574 --> 00:09.004
This is my father,
Henry Wilcox.

00:09.072 --> 00:12.108
Leaking confidential information
to Liza Hearn.

00:12.176 --> 00:13.347
You think
blowing your whistle's

00:13.415 --> 00:15.024
gonna gain you favor
in the agency?

00:15.091 --> 00:16.456
I learned from the best.

00:16.524 --> 00:18.390
So if I wanted
specialized weapons training...

00:18.458 --> 00:21.923
Consider it approved.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.884 --> 00:43.455
Sweet ride.

00:47.429 --> 00:49.697
I still think it'd be safer
if you took the ride share.

00:51.636 --> 00:52.938
Caught red-handed.

00:53.006 --> 00:54.607
Your landlord
said you'd be up here.

00:54.675 --> 00:56.108
Huh.

00:56.176 --> 01:00.313
Had a feeling she was
keeping tabs on me.

01:00.381 --> 01:01.681
I'm not even gonna ask
why you're behind the wheel

01:01.749 --> 01:04.049
of a '67 Vette.

01:04.117 --> 01:05.384
And she knows her cars.

01:05.450 --> 01:06.852
Dad was a car buff.

01:06.919 --> 01:09.053
Well, then you know
that the '67

01:09.121 --> 01:11.789
is the last great
American sports car.

01:11.856 --> 01:13.957
In '68,
new regulations came in

01:14.024 --> 01:16.793
that greatly reduced
performance.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.727
Still doesn't
answer my question.

01:18.795 --> 01:21.262
I loved Corvettes as Kid.

01:21.330 --> 01:23.264
Always wanted one.

01:23.332 --> 01:26.233
Finally saved up enough scratch
to buy this one in 2007,

01:26.301 --> 01:27.669
right before
I left for Iraq.

01:30.473 --> 01:31.975
And you held onto it.

01:32.043 --> 01:34.678
And you cannot
beat this sound.

01:36.014 --> 01:38.383
Mm! 435 horses.

01:42.621 --> 01:44.323
Why do I smell fichus?

01:47.861 --> 01:49.862
You said you'd take care
of my plant

01:49.930 --> 01:51.230
while was on vacation,
remember?

01:51.298 --> 01:52.499
Fichus is a tree.

01:52.533 --> 01:55.002
Not this one.

01:57.305 --> 01:58.739
Have a good vacation.

01:58.807 --> 02:00.141
You deserve it.

02:00.208 --> 02:01.275
Thanks.

02:08.049 --> 02:10.017
Now put on your seatbelt
before you hurt someone.

02:15.223 --> 02:17.157
As you know, with the change
of positions at the C.I.A.

02:17.225 --> 02:18.892
comes a routine polygraph.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.794
Took you guys a while.

02:20.862 --> 02:23.931
C.I.A. bureaucracy
never ceases to amaze.

02:23.998 --> 02:27.134
Heh.

02:27.201 --> 02:28.802
Office of Special Projects.
What is that?

02:28.870 --> 02:29.971
Is that part
of the polygraph?

02:33.309 --> 02:34.943
Your name is Jai Wilcox?

02:35.011 --> 02:36.311
Yes.

02:36.379 --> 02:37.879
You came back
from a post in London

02:37.947 --> 02:41.149
to work with Arthur Campbell
on Operation Lynx?

02:41.217 --> 02:42.717
Yes.

02:42.785 --> 02:44.118
Standard surveillance op?

02:44.186 --> 02:45.153
Yes.

02:58.370 --> 02:59.570
Friend of yours?

02:59.638 --> 03:01.172
Let's continue.

03:03.175 --> 03:05.944
Hey, I'm off to Stockholm.
I came to say good-bye.

03:06.012 --> 03:07.979
I will bring you back
some meatballs.

03:08.047 --> 03:09.681
They won't be as good
as Chez Danielle.

03:09.749 --> 03:12.351
Be better than Ikea, though.

03:12.419 --> 03:14.754
Nothin'?

03:14.821 --> 03:16.489
Tough room.

03:16.557 --> 03:19.225
Ah, my life's
not perfect, okay?

03:19.293 --> 03:19.960
Oh, no.
What's wrong?

03:26.401 --> 03:29.303
Michael...

03:29.370 --> 03:31.371
Wh-what did he do?

03:31.439 --> 03:34.007
I called him to ask him
about his absences from work.

03:34.075 --> 03:36.176
And he told me that he's had
two marital indiscretions

03:36.244 --> 03:38.445
in the past year.

03:38.512 --> 03:40.146
Oh, Danielle.

03:40.214 --> 03:42.749
Indiscretion is the chicken
shit way of saying

03:42.816 --> 03:44.450
you boinked
your fat assistant.

03:44.518 --> 03:46.052
I'm sorry.

03:46.119 --> 03:48.054
I've just been poring
over this date book

03:48.121 --> 03:49.989
trying to figure out
how it happened.

03:50.057 --> 03:51.758
Don't beat yourself up
over it.

03:51.826 --> 03:54.794
I feel like everyone
in my life...

03:54.862 --> 03:56.997
Has been lying to me
about huge things.

04:05.205 --> 04:06.739
You said yourself
you haven't had a vacation

04:06.807 --> 04:08.909
since you started
working at the Agency.

04:08.976 --> 04:10.911
Well, why don't
you go with me?

04:10.978 --> 04:12.979
No, I have miles.

04:13.047 --> 04:15.115
Plus, Chloe and Katia
are at moms.

04:15.183 --> 04:16.617
You need to get away.

04:16.684 --> 04:18.685
And I could use
a good wingman.

04:25.861 --> 04:27.428
Why do we
only get spontaneous

04:27.496 --> 04:28.896
when bad things
happen to us?

04:28.963 --> 04:30.731
Nature abhors a vacuum.

04:30.799 --> 04:32.399
That's so intellectual.

04:32.467 --> 04:34.801
No, I read it
in the in-flight magazine.

04:34.869 --> 04:35.802
Michael.

04:35.870 --> 04:37.069
Gonna answer it?

04:37.137 --> 04:38.337
Nope, I'm on vacation.

04:38.405 --> 04:40.206
Hey, do you remember
little Magnus

04:40.273 --> 04:42.340
from when we lived
on the base near Karlsborg?

04:42.408 --> 04:44.109
"First crush"
little Magnus?

04:44.176 --> 04:45.643
More like
"first kiss" little Magnus.

04:45.711 --> 04:47.913
- It was the go-go '80s.
- Apparently.

04:47.980 --> 04:49.848
- Anyway, I texted him.
- You texted him?

04:49.915 --> 04:50.982
Yeah, before we
got on the flight.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.118
He's on Facebook.

04:53.185 --> 04:56.087
- What's he doing now?
- He runs a flower shop.

04:56.155 --> 04:58.356
Ohh, that sounds
like little Magnus.

04:58.424 --> 04:59.457
Well, he loved flowers.

04:59.525 --> 05:01.459
Danielle, Annie?

05:01.527 --> 05:03.461
Little Magnus.

05:03.529 --> 05:06.131
So nice to see you.

05:06.198 --> 05:07.665
It's been so long.

05:07.733 --> 05:08.766
- Too long.
- Yeah.

05:08.834 --> 05:10.001
It's so good
to see you.

05:10.069 --> 05:11.669
Well...

05:15.307 --> 05:17.175
Let's get your bags.

05:19.245 --> 05:21.947
Yeah, I've got a solarium
and I've got a sailboat

05:22.014 --> 05:24.315
at our family cottage
in Krontorp.

05:24.383 --> 05:25.917
But didn't Danielle
mention that?

05:25.985 --> 05:28.954
No, she didn't.

05:29.022 --> 05:30.922
I think they lost my bag.

05:30.990 --> 05:32.390
On SAS?

05:32.458 --> 05:33.792
Maybe it's a sign
from above,

05:33.859 --> 05:35.527
like a chance
to start fresh.

05:35.595 --> 05:37.529
Or maybe they just
put it on the wrong plane.

05:37.596 --> 05:39.531
We'll fill out the form,
and they'll deliver it to you.

05:39.598 --> 05:40.966
In the meantime,

05:41.033 --> 05:42.634
I will take
you girls shopping.

05:42.702 --> 05:44.436
We can go through all the latest
boutiques in Stockholm.

05:44.504 --> 05:47.006
Oh, and maybe a glass of wine
by the Nybrokajen?

05:47.073 --> 05:49.041
Of course, I'll, uh,
go and grab the car,

05:49.109 --> 05:50.476
and I'll meet you girls
on the curbside.

05:50.543 --> 05:51.410
Shall I take your bags?

05:51.477 --> 05:52.845
Please.

05:52.912 --> 05:55.147
We'll be there
with bells on.

05:55.215 --> 05:57.549
Just take it easy, okay?

05:57.617 --> 05:58.951
I don't need
a babysitter.

05:59.019 --> 06:00.953
No, you need an overprotective
younger sister.

06:01.021 --> 06:03.055
Be right there.

06:03.123 --> 06:04.423
Auggie

06:04.491 --> 06:06.092
you working late, huh?

06:06.159 --> 06:08.461
Actually, my day's
just getting started.

06:08.529 --> 06:10.062
How's the vacation?

06:10.130 --> 06:13.433
Huh. I have a feeling
it's not a vacation anymore.

06:13.501 --> 06:15.302
Oh, the Agency
wouldn't be asking

06:15.369 --> 06:16.937
if it wasn't
time sensitive.

06:17.005 --> 06:18.806
All right,
what's the mission?

06:18.873 --> 06:20.508
We need you to courier
an eyes-only envelop

06:20.575 --> 06:22.109
to the Tre Kronor Gala

06:22.177 --> 06:24.512
at Waterfront Congress Centre
this afternoon.

06:24.580 --> 06:25.780
That's a tough ticket.

06:25.847 --> 06:27.782
See? There are
perks to the job.

06:29.017 --> 06:30.350
What's in the envelope?

06:30.418 --> 06:32.286
Eyes only isn't just
for my benefit.

06:32.353 --> 06:33.720
You ready to go?

06:33.788 --> 06:35.188
Yeah, I guess.

06:35.255 --> 06:36.856
Great, I'll text you
the details

06:36.924 --> 06:38.524
on our asset's location.

06:38.592 --> 06:39.926
You need to pick up
the envelope from him.

06:39.994 --> 06:41.761
You'll deliver it
to your contact

06:41.829 --> 06:44.130
at the Waterfront
Congress Centre,

06:44.197 --> 06:47.132
and no Aquavit till after
you hand off the envelope.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.668
You're definitely
cramping my vacation.

06:51.504 --> 06:53.505
Uh, Danielle?

06:53.573 --> 06:55.941
I have to do a quick thing
for work.

06:56.009 --> 06:57.175
Don't they know
you're just on vacation?

06:57.243 --> 06:58.243
Tell them no.

06:58.311 --> 06:59.477
Danielle.

06:59.545 --> 07:00.612
Yeah, but it's okay.

07:00.679 --> 07:02.447
I mean, we can still go.

07:02.515 --> 07:04.382
Yeah!

07:04.450 --> 07:05.817
Have fun working.

This port brings in
how many kronor?

08:25.758 --> 08:27.859
We pay how many in taxes?

08:27.927 --> 08:30.328
Plant operations can't
bring us a ladder.

08:30.396 --> 08:32.462
You want something done,
you have to do it yourself.

08:32.530 --> 08:34.398
- Yes?
- Suppose so.

08:34.466 --> 08:35.999
Yes.

08:36.067 --> 08:40.102
So also thinks the CIA.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.404
That's why they send you...

08:44.441 --> 08:47.143
Anywhere.

08:49.981 --> 08:53.016
Your package is here.

08:53.084 --> 08:55.052

As long as you're here,

08:56.755 --> 08:58.522
take a day or two
to relax.

08:58.590 --> 09:01.225
You C.I.A. people,
you come in and zip out,

09:01.293 --> 09:04.061
and Stockholm's
a beautiful city.

09:05.497 --> 09:08.499
It's not all work.

09:08.567 --> 09:09.834
Believe me...

09:09.901 --> 09:11.069
That was the idea.

09:13.372 --> 09:15.340
Oh, not bad
for a fellow former sailor.

09:15.407 --> 09:17.308
Ah, a little hard work,
a lot of good luck.

09:17.376 --> 09:18.943
Look at that--leather.

09:19.011 --> 09:20.645
I can't get budgeted
for an Aeron chair

09:20.712 --> 09:22.480
even with a doctor's note.

09:22.548 --> 09:25.216
Did you come here
to bitch about furniture?

09:25.284 --> 09:26.851
No.

09:26.919 --> 09:29.921
Do you know
of an Operation Lynx?

09:31.857 --> 09:33.559
Who's talking about it?

09:33.626 --> 09:36.662
Well, apparently
a routine polygraph was failed,

09:36.730 --> 09:38.164
which led to a G.C.O. inquest

09:38.232 --> 09:39.699
into this particular
operation.

09:39.767 --> 09:41.568
Whose polygrap

09:41.636 --> 09:44.905
Jai Wilcox.

09:44.972 --> 09:46.673
Are you vulnerable?

09:48.208 --> 09:51.310
You could say
I'm vulnerable.

09:51.378 --> 09:53.679
Then I'd suggest you try
and get out in front of this.

09:53.747 --> 09:55.481
Thanks, Eric.

09:55.549 --> 09:56.982
I owe you one.

09:57.050 --> 09:58.583
Hmm.

09:58.651 --> 10:00.585
One of those.

10:05.524 --> 10:07.258
I was surprised to get
your phone call, Auggie.

10:07.325 --> 10:09.794
Yeah, I didn't think
I'd be back here.

10:11.363 --> 10:12.697
So what made you
change your mind?

10:12.765 --> 10:15.434
Oh, being unable to see.

10:15.501 --> 10:16.702
Ah.

10:16.769 --> 10:19.872
Well, last M.R.I. we did

10:19.940 --> 10:20.973
was shortly
after your injury.

10:21.041 --> 10:22.542
So it's possible

10:22.610 --> 10:24.344
some of the cranial swelling
has gone down.

10:24.412 --> 10:25.812
From there,
we can assess...

10:25.880 --> 10:27.047
If any of the new
stem cell approaches

10:27.114 --> 10:29.282
may be appropriate.

10:29.350 --> 10:32.218
- Yeah.
- That's why I'm here.

10:32.285 --> 10:34.219
Well, I mean, the M.R.I.
can only determine

10:34.287 --> 10:36.055
if you're a viable candidate,
all right?

10:36.122 --> 10:38.623

17:23.143 --> 17:26.212

17:49.605 --> 17:51.906

18:01.617 --> 18:04.319
You can get rid of
a major obstacle in your way.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.988
You want me

We both had a hand in it.

18:13.995 --> 18:15.296
I wouldn't defend
the man who called you in

18:15.363 --> 18:17.698

18:32.979 --> 18:34.913
about your allegiances.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.815
Any sympathy for Arthur
will be seen as weakness,

18:36.883 --> 18:38.750
and you will be marched out
along with him.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.585
I don't have
any sympathy for Arthur.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.853

the last name Walker.

21:27.374 --> 21:29.309
She's tall and blonde.

21:29.377 --> 21:31.144
I know that's not
very rare in Sweden.

21:31.212 --> 21:33.547
Oh, here she is.
Where have you been?

21:33.615 --> 21:34.915
Where were you?

21:34.983 --> 21:36.417
Oh, I was in
the business center,

21:36.484 --> 21:38.118

to email the girls.

21:38.186 --> 21:39.285

21:57.103 --> 21:59.305

21:59.373 --> 22:00.940
And I am not trying

22:08.650 --> 22:10.985
Yeah.

22:11.053 --> 22:12.788
Why aren't we going
to the airport?

22:12.855 --> 22:14.590
It's too predictable.

22:14.657 --> 22:17.026
We'll go to the train station
and go west to Oslo.

22:17.094 --> 22:18.294
We'll fly out from there.

22:20.597 --> 22:22.731
Don't be nervous.

22:22.799 --> 22:25.467
This is already awkward.

22:25.535 --> 22:26.769
Ah, it would have
been more awkward

22:26.837 --> 22:28.270
if Arthur actually
knew this was happening.

22:32.908 --> 22:35.243
All right,
you're both C.I.A.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.944
Well, you used to be
one of us.

22:37.012 --> 22:38.512
I also used to be
married to Arthur.

22:38.580 --> 22:39.813
Who consulted you
in an operation

22:39.881 --> 22:41.949
called Lynx.

22:43.419 --> 22:44.920
Is that what
this is about?

22:44.987 --> 22:47.656
It is.

22:47.724 --> 22:50.126
You want to know
what we talked about?

22:51.828 --> 22:53.396
We talked about you, Joan.

22:54.998 --> 22:57.134
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

22:57.201 --> 23:00.236
Arthur was concerned

23:00.304 --> 23:03.906
if any blowback from operation
Lynx could land on you.

23:03.974 --> 23:07.476
He thinks you have a stellar
career ahead at the Agency

23:07.544 --> 23:09.011
and beyond.

23:09.079 --> 23:10.812
Career in politics.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.948
A Senate bid, perhaps.

23:13.015 --> 23:14.282
He didn't want
to jeopardize that.

23:17.019 --> 23:17.986
It's true, Joan.

23:19.822 --> 23:22.724
I hope the C.I.A.
hasn't made you that paranoid.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.060
It has.

23:25.127 --> 23:28.530
But I believe you.

23:28.597 --> 23:30.866
Thank you.

23:33.436 --> 23:36.706
So what's it like
being out of the Agency?

23:36.774 --> 23:40.109
As you well know,

23:40.177 --> 23:43.246
the Agency wasn't a great
period in my life.

23:43.314 --> 23:46.083
Yeah.

23:46.151 --> 23:47.985
I'm sorry about that.

23:50.055 --> 23:53.458
Don't be.

23:53.525 --> 23:57.629
My life is infinitely better
than it was back then.

23:57.697 --> 24:01.165
My decisions are my own.

24:01.233 --> 24:04.868
I found a good place.

24:04.936 --> 24:06.536
Uh, thank you.

24:06.604 --> 24:08.438
Take care.

24:21.551 --> 24:23.753
Hello, August.

24:23.821 --> 24:25.154
Jai.

24:25.222 --> 24:28.625
Has the second floor
treating you?

24:28.693 --> 24:31.695
Do you know what
an elevator pitch is?

24:31.796 --> 24:34.665
Yeah, talking points that
can be outlined quickly.

24:34.733 --> 24:35.966
Well, here's mine.

24:36.034 --> 24:38.302
Everybody knows
about the inquest.

24:38.370 --> 24:40.437
Arthur likes you
and respects you,

24:40.505 --> 24:42.239
and he is a good
and decent man.

24:42.306 --> 24:44.975
If you disregard that
and try to get him fired,

24:45.042 --> 24:46.876
your career will tank.

24:46.944 --> 24:49.311
I'm comfortable
with my decisions.

24:49.379 --> 24:50.979
I hope you are.

24:51.047 --> 24:52.581
Because you
are systematically

24:52.649 --> 24:55.216
alienating
everyone in this building.

24:55.284 --> 24:59.119
Elevator pitch concluded.

25:14.703 --> 25:16.537
What is it?

25:16.605 --> 25:18.206
Did you see all the cops?

25:18.273 --> 25:19.841
Well, that's
a good thing, right?

25:19.909 --> 25:23.145
No. Train security in Sweden
is privatized.

25:23.213 --> 25:25.181
They're here
looking for someone.

25:25.248 --> 25:26.382
- Us?
- Maybe.

25:26.449 --> 25:28.116
Why?

25:28.184 --> 25:29.785
'Cause my life
is complicated.

25:29.852 --> 25:32.487
Hey, look, there's
that creepy guy at the party.

26:10.893 --> 26:13.361
My phone.

26:13.429 --> 26:14.529
Turn it off.

26:17.299 --> 26:18.766
It's Michael.

27:21.633 --> 27:22.766
Hey.

27:22.833 --> 27:25.169
Just stick
close to my hip, please.

27:25.236 --> 27:26.870
Talk to me, Annie.
What do you see?

27:26.938 --> 27:29.506
Cops.
Lots and lots of cops.

27:29.574 --> 27:31.441
I I.D.'d the guy that
contacted Danielle.

27:31.509 --> 27:34.010
He was confabbing
with the polisen officers.

27:34.077 --> 27:36.111
So he's connected.

27:36.179 --> 27:38.347
Yeah. What about
a heli extraction?

27:38.414 --> 27:40.483
Swedish government
won't allow it.

27:40.550 --> 27:43.987
Well, I'm running
out of options here.

27:44.055 --> 27:47.290
I could reroute an American
trawler in the Baltic.

27:47.358 --> 27:49.093
You're a genius.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.595
Oh, I'm just a guy with
a bunch of phones and computers.

27:51.630 --> 27:53.297
You're doing the heavy lifting
on this one.

27:53.365 --> 27:56.200
Do I detect a hint
of modesty?

27:56.268 --> 27:57.769
Not a chance.

27:57.836 --> 27:59.137
Hang in there, Walker.

28:00.272 --> 28:02.206
Who are you talking to?

28:02.274 --> 28:04.908
A coworker
from the Agency.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.011
We're in good hands.

28:07.078 --> 28:09.113
I need you to call
little Magnus.

28:09.180 --> 28:12.349
I don't think
he wants to talk to me.

28:12.417 --> 28:14.384
Tell him
it's a flower emergency.

28:18.155 --> 28:19.756
I'm glad Magnus
is so understanding,

28:19.824 --> 28:21.825
but I still don't understand
why I had to call him.

28:21.893 --> 28:24.495
Magnus has a boat at his
cottage in Thamn, remember?

28:24.562 --> 28:26.430
We can use it
to sail into the Baltic

28:26.498 --> 28:28.466
and rendezvous
with an extraction team.

28:28.533 --> 28:30.101
How much danger
are we in?

28:30.169 --> 28:32.604
The real answer,
which may scare you

28:32.671 --> 28:34.506
more than calm you is...

28:34.607 --> 28:36.307
I don't know
what's going on...

28:36.375 --> 28:37.909
Or how much danger
we're in.

28:37.977 --> 28:40.311
I don't care if the cod
are running closer

28:40.379 --> 28:41.646
to the Kaliningrad Oblast,

28:41.713 --> 28:43.681
I need a trawler
off of Torhamn.

28:43.749 --> 28:46.784
Okay, I'll call your boss.

28:46.852 --> 28:49.119
Auggie, there's
a Dr. Kessle on one.

28:51.322 --> 28:52.189
Yeah, I'll take him.

28:52.256 --> 28:53.690
Close the door.

29:12.209 --> 29:13.976
Dr. Kessle.

29:14.044 --> 29:14.977
Auggie.

29:15.045 --> 29:16.379
Anything?

29:16.446 --> 29:18.014
Our M.R.I. results came in.

29:18.081 --> 29:20.784
I'm sorry to say you are not
a suitable candidate

29:20.852 --> 29:23.553
for the experimental therapies
at this time.

29:29.127 --> 29:30.461
Okay. Thanks.

29:30.529 --> 29:31.729
I'm very sorry, Auggie.

29:31.797 --> 29:32.997
Ok, then.

29:33.065 --> 29:34.599
- Auggie.
- I gotta go.

29:46.644 --> 29:50.546
Get me North Star Marine's
general manger, ASAP.

29:55.551 --> 29:57.051
Thank you
for talking with us.

29:57.119 --> 29:58.653
I don't believe
I had a choice.

29:58.721 --> 30:00.155
But before we begin,

30:00.222 --> 30:01.056
I'd like
to make a statement

30:01.157 --> 30:02.557
on a separate issue.

30:02.625 --> 30:05.494
I think you'll find it
of some interest.

30:05.561 --> 30:07.195
Go ahead.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.064
My name is Jai Wilcox.

30:09.131 --> 30:11.032
I am the son
of Henry Wilcox,

30:11.100 --> 30:14.035
former D.C.S. and current
leak of information

30:14.103 --> 30:17.438
to the reporter Liza Hearn.

30:17.506 --> 30:19.039
I will now outline
my father's involvement

30:19.107 --> 30:21.008
in the leak scandal

30:21.076 --> 30:23.110
and provide to the board
a comprehensive timeline

30:23.177 --> 30:25.612
as fully as I can.

30:38.324 --> 30:40.092
Was it Jai?

30:44.165 --> 30:46.601
Let me finish my round.

30:52.775 --> 30:54.143
It always goes in
when the pressure's off.

31:11.795 --> 31:14.030
You don't have to worry.
We're off the grid here.

31:14.097 --> 31:16.699
The nearest neighbor is, like,
half a tank of gas away,

31:16.766 --> 31:18.066
and with
the fuel prices here,

31:18.134 --> 31:20.035
we don't see much of him.

31:20.103 --> 31:22.037
Can we sail?

31:22.105 --> 31:23.706
Into that storm?

31:23.773 --> 31:26.309
I wouldn't recommend it.

31:26.376 --> 31:28.044
When can we go?

31:28.111 --> 31:29.913
Well, the weather changes
kind of quickly here,

31:29.980 --> 31:33.984
so I guess we'd be okay
in a couple of hours.

31:34.018 --> 31:35.019
Okay, then, we'll wait.

31:36.722 --> 31:38.589
Come on.

31:38.657 --> 31:40.491
Auggie...

31:40.559 --> 31:41.860
Any updates?

31:41.927 --> 31:43.495
I got some intel
on Annie's package.

31:43.562 --> 31:46.031
It's a task order
on a Nils Crofft.

31:46.099 --> 31:48.433
Used to contract
for us.

31:48.501 --> 31:49.635
Black ops.
Then he turned.

31:49.702 --> 31:51.103
We were trying
to get to him

31:51.170 --> 31:52.371
before he did
any more damage.

31:52.438 --> 31:53.905
Apparently,
we were too late.

31:53.973 --> 31:55.841
Well, now he knows
Annie can I.D. him.

31:55.909 --> 31:57.276
What is Annie's status?

31:57.343 --> 31:59.077
Water evac.

31:59.145 --> 32:00.746
We have a trawler waiting
on the Baltic.

32:00.813 --> 32:02.347
Last-ditch play.

32:05.452 --> 32:07.019
You like the tea?

32:07.086 --> 32:09.154
- Oh, it's good.
- Huh?

32:09.222 --> 32:12.124
It's called
Soderblandning.

32:12.192 --> 32:13.525
It's a good Swedish tea.

32:15.895 --> 32:17.363
Well I, for one,
think it's lovely

32:17.430 --> 32:18.697
to live out
in the country like this.

32:18.765 --> 32:19.765
Hmm.

32:19.833 --> 32:21.066
Well, you know,

32:21.134 --> 32:24.570
it can get a bit lonely
sometimes.

32:24.637 --> 32:27.906
Well, uh, guess I better
go and check on the boat.

32:27.974 --> 32:31.643
I can have the mainsails
rigged in ten minutes.

32:34.814 --> 32:37.983
I didn't tell him to leave.
He left on his own.

32:38.051 --> 32:40.753
The trawler's gonna pick us up
on Hammerora Island.

32:40.821 --> 32:43.122
There's a backup
at Gotland, but...

32:43.189 --> 32:44.890
my tech op's
pretty on it.

32:44.958 --> 32:46.759
Well, it must be nice
to have an Auggie in your life.

32:48.829 --> 32:50.496
An Auggie?

32:50.564 --> 32:52.131
Well, it Auggie, right,

32:52.199 --> 32:53.632
who you talk to?

32:53.700 --> 32:56.068
I may not be
a spy like you,

32:56.136 --> 32:58.671
but your voice changes a little
when you talk to him.

32:58.739 --> 33:01.641
It--it does?

33:01.709 --> 33:02.775
Yeah.

33:05.345 --> 33:07.013
Have some more tea.

33:07.081 --> 33:08.582
I understand
with Magnus is talking about

33:08.649 --> 33:11.752
there is kind of a romance
in the isolation here.

33:11.820 --> 33:13.654
Like the fact that there
are no street addresses.

33:13.722 --> 33:15.256
I had to write
the name of the cottage,

33:15.324 --> 33:18.827
Krontorp, on my last
luggage form.

33:18.894 --> 33:21.362
You put Krontorp
on the luggage form?

33:21.430 --> 33:22.764
Yeah, well, I thought
there was a chance

33:22.832 --> 33:24.599
that Magnus and I would

33:24.667 --> 33:27.002
come out of here and...
Wasn't thinking clearly.

33:28.171 --> 33:29.504
We need to me.

33:29.572 --> 33:30.872
He's here.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.303
I'm scared.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.739
- It's okay.
- How do you stay so calm?

34:35.808 --> 34:38.576
Moments like this,
I think of you and the girls.

34:41.112 --> 34:41.745
Stay close.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.627
Run.

36:02.695 --> 36:04.228
Run to the boat.

36:04.296 --> 36:07.132
Do not look back,
no matter what.

36:55.016 --> 36:57.884
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

36:57.952 --> 36:59.085
It's over.

37:14.782 --> 37:17.384
So...Thank you.

37:17.452 --> 37:18.585
For what?

37:20.155 --> 37:21.655
You held my fate
in your hands,

37:21.723 --> 37:23.258
and you chose
do the right thing.

37:23.325 --> 37:25.060
It speaks volumes.

37:27.297 --> 37:29.098
It's funny...

37:29.165 --> 37:31.534
being constantly
underestimated.

37:32.802 --> 37:35.604
I was being complementary.

37:35.672 --> 37:39.040
You think I did this out of
some deep-seated morality...

37:39.108 --> 37:42.744
Where this talk would be
my cherished reward.

37:42.811 --> 37:44.145
Don't you get it?

37:44.213 --> 37:46.414
I failed the polygraph
on purpose.

37:49.351 --> 37:52.052
What is your purpose?

37:52.120 --> 37:55.757
Everyone knows
about the inquest.

37:55.824 --> 37:59.761
How I chose
the ethical path...

37:59.828 --> 38:03.765
Over the preservation
of my own father.

38:03.833 --> 38:06.669
I finally got rid of
the stink of nepotism.

38:06.736 --> 38:10.073
And soon, I'll be going
after Joan's job.

38:10.141 --> 38:12.109
And if you step in
to defend her,

38:12.176 --> 38:13.243
that stink
will be back on you,

38:13.311 --> 38:14.644
and you'll both be gone,

38:14.712 --> 38:16.713
and I'll be running
the D.P.D.

38:16.781 --> 38:19.116
Thanks for the scotch.

38:28.460 --> 38:30.127
They're from Michael.

38:30.194 --> 38:33.163
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

38:56.155 --> 38:57.455
Mmm.

38:57.522 --> 38:59.357
I think you should
move back in.

38:59.425 --> 39:00.859
I'd love to.

39:03.863 --> 39:06.165
Where can a girl
get a fichus around here?

39:07.634 --> 39:08.968
About the fichus...

39:09.036 --> 39:10.670
What?

39:10.738 --> 39:14.107
Ah, don't give a live plant
to a blind guy.

39:16.410 --> 39:17.677
Sorry.

39:17.745 --> 39:19.813
It's okay.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.282
You okay?
Well...

39:22.350 --> 39:23.816
Rough couple days.
You?

39:23.884 --> 39:25.585
Rough couple of days.

39:25.652 --> 39:26.986
I heard.

39:38.364 --> 39:42.134
I'm sorry, Annie, but your
life's going to change.

39:42.202 --> 39:45.136
Inside the Agency
and out.

39:45.204 --> 39:48.239
I can still feel
the recoil of the gun.

39:48.307 --> 39:51.575
The acid smell of the bullet
and the echo.

39:51.643 --> 39:54.545
Time stops.

39:54.613 --> 39:56.881
You know, you don't have
to go through this alone.

39:56.949 --> 40:00.251
The Agency has people
you can talk to.

40:00.319 --> 40:02.687
The person I want
to talk to you is you.

40:07.727 --> 40:09.561
Well, how fortuitous.

40:09.629 --> 40:13.231
Because I have something I
wanted to talk to you about too.

40:17.838 --> 40:19.505
Another mission?

40:19.573 --> 40:21.074
Not exactly.

40:27.983 --> 40:31.184
You're giving me your car?

40:31.252 --> 40:33.486
I'm moving on.

40:33.554 --> 40:34.921
And you need
some cheering up.

40:34.989 --> 40:36.822
Knowing how fast
you like to drive,

40:36.890 --> 40:38.223
this ought to do it.

40:41.694 --> 40:44.029
Well, what do you say
we take her for a spin?

40:44.097 --> 40:45.864
Ohh.

40:45.931 --> 40:49.200
Actually, I have
a plane to catch now.

40:49.268 --> 40:50.501
Where to?

40:50.569 --> 40:52.837
I'm going to Africa.

40:52.905 --> 40:56.341
Gonna look somebody in the eye,
so to speak,

40:56.409 --> 40:58.210
and say what
I need to say.

41:01.748 --> 41:03.583
Well, uh...

41:06.954 --> 41:09.623
Whoever it is,
I hope they hear you.

41:11.092 --> 41:13.193
I know she will.

41:16.130 --> 41:18.765
Well, you know you wanna
drive it so drive it.

41:29.944 --> 41:32.646
I can literally
hear you smiling.

41:40.255 --> 41:42.956
Any tips?

41:43.024 --> 41:45.292
Give her
all you got, Walker.

41:45.360 --> 41:46.760
She can take it.
