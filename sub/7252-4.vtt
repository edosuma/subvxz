WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:08.592
- Hey, you're up.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.592
- Hey, you're cooking.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.469
Yep, making the works,

00:08.634 --> 00:10.469
even threw in a couple

00:10.511 --> 00:12.137
blintzes in there

00:10.511 --> 00:12.137
to confuse you.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.848
Wow. Where did

00:12.179 --> 00:13.848
all this come from?

00:13.889 --> 00:14.890
What?

00:14.932 --> 00:16.266
The food, the pans

00:16.308 --> 00:17.726
the bowls, the spatula.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.728
Food's from Doose's,

00:17.768 --> 00:19.728
pans and bowls, you had

00:19.770 --> 00:21.146
and the spatula's mine.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.106
- You travel with a spatula?

00:21.188 --> 00:23.106
- Sometimes.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.441
You've actually

00:23.148 --> 00:24.441
found yourself

00:24.483 --> 00:25.901
in scraping

00:24.483 --> 00:25.901
and flipping situations

00:25.943 --> 00:27.486
without the trusty

00:25.943 --> 00:27.486
spatula before?

00:27.528 --> 00:30.197
Your coffee should

00:27.528 --> 00:30.197
be ready in a minute.

00:30.238 --> 00:31.657
Smells good.

00:33.617 --> 00:36.411
- Hey, Luke?

00:33.617 --> 00:36.411
- Yep.

00:36.453 --> 00:40.916
- You cooking this is so sweet.

00:36.453 --> 00:40.916
- But?

00:40.958 --> 00:43.168
I just figured, you know, we'd

00:40.958 --> 00:43.168
go to Luke's for breakfast.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.546
- Why?

00:43.210 --> 00:45.546
- I like Luke's breakfast.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.839
- I<i> am</i> Luke.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.839
- I know.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.173
This is the same stuff

00:46.881 --> 00:48.173
I make at the diner.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.383
- I know

00:48.215 --> 00:49.383
- So what's the difference?

00:49.424 --> 00:50.509
Well, the difference

00:49.424 --> 00:50.509
is that while

00:50.551 --> 00:51.844
you are Luke,

00:50.551 --> 00:51.844
we're not at Luke's.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.387
- So?

00:51.886 --> 00:53.387
- I have my things, you know?

00:53.428 --> 00:54.638
I have certain things.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.849
And one of my things

00:54.680 --> 00:56.849
is going to Luke's.

00:56.891 --> 01:00.644
And just because I

00:56.891 --> 01:00.644
now have dating Luke

01:00.686 --> 01:02.646
doesn't mean I want

01:00.686 --> 01:02.646
to lose my cooking Luke.

01:02.688 --> 01:04.732
But I<i> am</i> cooking, and I<i> am</i> Luke.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.860
Look, it's like Tommy Lee

01:04.773 --> 01:07.860
having a Starbucks at his house.

01:07.902 --> 01:10.111
- What?

01:07.902 --> 01:10.111
- 'It sounds great.'

01:10.153 --> 01:12.072
But half the reason you

01:10.153 --> 01:12.072
go to a Starbucks is to

01:12.113 --> 01:14.115
go to a Starbucks, you know,

01:12.113 --> 01:14.115
to go out and see the people.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.993
Tommy Lee has

01:14.157 --> 01:15.993
a Starbucks in his house?

01:16.035 --> 01:17.327
"Cribs," baby. Watch it.

01:17.369 --> 01:18.370
Like a whole Starbucks

01:18.412 --> 01:19.496
with workers and everything?

01:19.538 --> 01:20.622
The point is that

01:20.664 --> 01:22.249
while some things have changed

01:22.290 --> 01:24.043
and that's great

01:24.083 --> 01:26.211
I don't want everything

01:24.083 --> 01:26.211
to change completely.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.963
Okay. I'll see you at Luke's.

01:28.005 --> 01:30.007
Ah! I'll see

01:28.005 --> 01:30.007
you at Luke's!

01:30.049 --> 01:31.050
Hello?

01:31.090 --> 01:32.259
"Cultural disenfranchisement

01:32.300 --> 01:33.677
with women's role models"

01:33.719 --> 01:35.429
- Do you have it?

01:33.719 --> 01:35.429
- Oh, God, I hope not.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.347
It's the book for the class

01:35.470 --> 01:37.347
that I'm officially late to.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.891
- Oh.

01:37.389 --> 01:38.891
- What are you looking for?

01:38.933 --> 01:40.059
A big, boring book.

01:40.099 --> 01:41.226
- Who is that?

01:40.099 --> 01:41.226
- Uh, it's Luke?

01:41.268 --> 01:42.603
- Who's that?

01:41.268 --> 01:42.603
- It's Rory.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.021
Well, it's pretty

01:42.644 --> 01:44.021
early in the morning

01:44.063 --> 01:45.313
for Luke to be there.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.106
Unless, perhaps,

01:45.355 --> 01:47.106
he woke up there.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.817
- Well, he did.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.817
- He did what?

01:48.859 --> 01:50.986
- Are you talking about me?

01:48.859 --> 01:50.986
- Man, that's weird.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.362
- 'What's weird?'

01:51.028 --> 01:52.362
- 'Who's weird? I'm weird?'

01:52.404 --> 01:53.614
The thought of

01:52.404 --> 01:53.614
Luke running around

01:53.655 --> 01:55.198
naked in my kitchen,

01:53.655 --> 01:55.198
it's weird.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.867
Luke is not running around

01:55.240 --> 01:56.867
naked in your kitchen.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.160
He is sitting at the table,

01:56.909 --> 01:59.160
and, yes, he is naked.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.829
Don't do that.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.829
Don't tell her I'm naked.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.831
I'm not naked.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.375
- He sounds naked.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.375
- 'Well, the chairs are cold.'

02:05.417 --> 02:07.920
He actually tried

02:05.417 --> 02:07.920
to make me breakfast.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.797
- 'Really?'

02:07.962 --> 02:09.797
- Yeah, naked.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.090
Okay, that's it,

02:09.838 --> 02:11.090
I'm gone.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.841
Oh, no, no, no.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.841
Sorry, don't, no.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.094
Rory, um, Luke

02:12.883 --> 02:15.094
is fully dressed.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.845
He never came

02:15.135 --> 02:16.845
in the house.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.639
He just stood

02:16.887 --> 02:18.639
outside all night, um

02:18.680 --> 02:20.348
playing "In Your Eyes"

02:18.680 --> 02:20.348
on a boom box.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.725
I have to go,

02:20.390 --> 02:21.725
if you find the book

02:21.767 --> 02:23.226
bring it to Friday-night

02:21.767 --> 02:23.226
dinner, okay?

02:23.268 --> 02:24.853
- 'You got it.'

02:23.268 --> 02:24.853
- Go back to your dirtiness.

Thanks a lot.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.580
I photographed it

03:23.871 --> 03:25.580
before you moved it

03:25.622 --> 03:26.623
so if there's any damage

03:26.665 --> 03:27.875
you'll be hearing

03:26.665 --> 03:27.875
from my lawyer.

03:27.916 --> 03:28.876
- Hi.

03:28.917 --> 03:29.918
Introduce me

03:28.917 --> 03:29.918
to your friend.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.294
This is a Blou printing press

03:31.336 --> 03:32.546
eighteenth century.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.589
- And it's here because?

03:32.587 --> 03:34.589
- It's Asher's.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.550
He left it to me.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.550
It's beautiful, don't you think?

03:36.591 --> 03:39.594
Yeah. Think it goes great with

03:36.591 --> 03:39.594
the entire width of the room.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.971
I know it's

03:39.636 --> 03:40.971
a little cumbersome

03:41.013 --> 03:42.181
but we don't have to

03:41.013 --> 03:42.181
leave it right here.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.390
We could move it about

03:43.431 --> 03:45.017
six inches in any direction.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.226
Paris, we can't

03:45.059 --> 03:46.226
just leave it here.

03:46.267 --> 03:47.602
I have nowhere

03:46.267 --> 03:47.602
else to put it.

03:47.644 --> 03:48.645
And you have to

03:47.644 --> 03:48.645
think of the benefits

03:48.687 --> 03:49.980
of having it here.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.439
- Like?

03:50.022 --> 03:51.439
- No one else will have one.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.983
Which means it's unique.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.359
Which makes us unique.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.195
Kids our age do

03:54.401 --> 03:56.195
crazy things to make

03:56.236 --> 03:58.488
themselves unique.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.488
Piercings, blue hair,<i> kabbalah.</i>

03:58.530 --> 04:00.074
It will be a great

03:58.530 --> 04:00.074
conversation piece.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.034
- We'll be the talk of Branford.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.034
- I believe we will.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.535
We can print our own

04:02.076 --> 04:03.535
newsletter, if you'd like.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.286
"The Eccentric Gazette."

04:03.577 --> 04:05.286
I love it.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.455
It's from Asher.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.455
Just try it for a while.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.833
I promise, if it gets in

04:07.497 --> 04:09.833
the way, we'll get rid of it.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.377
Paris, it's

04:09.875 --> 04:12.377
on my book bag.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.880
I'm late for class and you put a

04:12.419 --> 04:14.880
printing press on my book bag?

04:14.922 --> 04:18.133
Well, sorry. It's from

04:14.922 --> 04:18.133
my dead boyfriend, okay?

04:18.175 --> 04:20.844
I apologize if my grief

04:18.175 --> 04:20.844
is inconveniencing you.

04:20.886 --> 04:22.679
Maybe I'll just put

04:20.886 --> 04:22.679
myself on an iceberg

04:22.721 --> 04:24.264
and float myself

04:22.721 --> 04:24.264
out to sea so that

04:24.305 --> 04:25.515
no one will have to

04:24.305 --> 04:25.515
deal with my suffering.

04:25.557 --> 04:26.600
Well, just get that thing

04:26.641 --> 04:28.476
off my bag before you go.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.980
This is outrageous,

04:28.518 --> 04:31.980
and he will call me back.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.024
And it had better

04:32.022 --> 04:34.024
be in a timely manner

04:34.066 --> 04:36.359
or I will come down

04:34.066 --> 04:36.359
there and introduce myself

04:36.401 --> 04:38.904
and, oh,

04:36.401 --> 04:38.904
the fun we'll have.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.616
- I hate this chair!

04:40.572 --> 04:42.616
- What's the matter, honey?

04:42.657 --> 04:44.451
Justin and Cameron

04:42.657 --> 04:44.451
having trouble again?

04:44.492 --> 04:46.578
I just got off the phone with

04:44.492 --> 04:46.578
the very promising young man

04:46.620 --> 04:48.329
working as

04:46.620 --> 04:48.329
Taylor's assistant

04:48.371 --> 04:50.124
to try and talk to

04:48.371 --> 04:50.124
the man about this.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.209
No, no.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.209
He rejected it again?

04:52.251 --> 04:54.461
I believe that is what

04:52.251 --> 04:54.461
the bright red letters say.

04:54.502 --> 04:56.797
We only need two lousy parking

04:54.502 --> 04:56.797
spaces. What is his problem?

04:56.838 --> 04:58.882
Oh, the list is long.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.592
- It's the third time, Michel.

04:58.924 --> 05:00.592
- I know.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.095
The third time that

05:00.634 --> 05:03.095
Bus-and-Truck-Tour Mussolini

05:03.137 --> 05:04.221
has rejected our permit.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.722
And I was there

05:04.263 --> 05:05.722
for every show.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.682
What is "Rejection code M?"

05:07.724 --> 05:09.684
Uh..."Applicant's

05:07.724 --> 05:09.684
name does not match

05:09.726 --> 05:11.478
name listed on articles

05:09.726 --> 05:11.478
of incorporation."

05:11.519 --> 05:13.147
Uh! Is he serious?

05:13.188 --> 05:14.231
Apparently, you

05:13.188 --> 05:14.231
did not put your

05:14.273 --> 05:15.523
middle name on

05:14.273 --> 05:15.523
this application.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.067
However, you did

05:15.565 --> 05:17.067
put your middle name

05:17.109 --> 05:18.735
on the articles

05:17.109 --> 05:18.735
of incorporation.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.570
So the names don't match and

05:18.777 --> 05:20.570
Taylor has no idea who you are.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.363
Oh, I'm the person

05:20.612 --> 05:22.363
whose foot

05:22.405 --> 05:24.283
is going to prevent him from

05:22.405 --> 05:24.283
sitting down, that's who I am.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.534
You always promise to hurt

05:24.324 --> 05:26.534
him, but then you don't.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.828
You're a Taylor tease.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.621
- I'm getting coffee.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.621
- Hmm.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.624
Ah, perfect timing!

05:32.666 --> 05:34.417
Oh, Sookie, I really

05:32.666 --> 05:34.417
need some coffee.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.962
- First this.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.962
- But it's right over there..

05:37.004 --> 05:39.380
- Okay, what am I looking at?

05:37.004 --> 05:39.380
- Jackson's tomatoes.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.799
Here we go.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.220
Hmm. Where

05:43.885 --> 05:45.220
are you going?

05:45.262 --> 05:46.429
I was just gonna get a little--

05:46.471 --> 05:48.682
Eat this.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.349
Isn't that the greatest

05:48.723 --> 05:50.349
tomato you've ever eaten?

05:50.391 --> 05:52.060
- It's good.

05:50.391 --> 05:52.060
- Good?

05:52.102 --> 05:53.979
- It's great.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.979
- Great?

05:54.021 --> 05:56.773
All I wanted was a cup

05:54.021 --> 05:56.773
of coffee. Oh, thank you.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.859
Sorry, Jackson.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.859
This is one rocking tomato.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.359
This is the first batch

06:00.401 --> 06:02.154
grown in my brand new

06:00.401 --> 06:02.154
hydroponic greenhouse.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.404
Jackson designed it himself.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.614
Built most of it myself too.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.866
You know what this means.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.534
The best tomatoes

06:05.907 --> 06:07.534
on the East Coast

06:07.575 --> 06:09.368
<i>and</i> in October.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.871
Huh? October!

06:10.912 --> 06:12.706
Uh...it sure ain't November.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.749
This means

06:12.747 --> 06:14.749
year-round vegetables.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.002
I am never gonna be a slave

06:14.791 --> 06:17.002
to Mother Nature ever again.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.129
- If I wanna make it..

06:17.044 --> 06:19.129
- Then I'm gonna grow it.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.756
Aw, you two really found

06:19.171 --> 06:21.756
each other, didn't you?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.342
Do you want another

06:21.798 --> 06:23.342
piece of tomato?

06:23.382 --> 06:24.843
Do I.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.722
Boys, leave us, please.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.476
[knocking on door]

06:35.312 --> 06:37.356
Ben Franklin was

06:35.312 --> 06:37.356
out of his mind.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.068
- Hey.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.237
So, come on in.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.237
Dean, you remember Paris.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.488
Yes, I do. Uh, how

06:43.278 --> 06:45.488
you doing, Paris?

06:45.530 --> 06:46.865
I'm fine.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.161
- What's that?

06:48.491 --> 06:51.161
- Uh, that's a printing press.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.830
Haven't you heard? Tats

06:51.203 --> 06:53.830
are out, movable type is in.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.083
I've heard that.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.335
So, my room's in there.

06:58.377 --> 06:59.669
Nice to see

06:58.377 --> 06:59.669
you again, Paris.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.921
Right back at you.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.216
You're back with

07:02.421 --> 07:04.216
farmer boy? What gives?

07:04.258 --> 07:05.717
- Paris..

07:04.258 --> 07:05.717
- I thought he was married.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.761
- He was, now he's not.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.761
- Well, well, well.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.388
Hoss returns.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.388
Who would've thunk?

07:09.428 --> 07:11.932
- I'm going in my room now.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.932
- Just...hold on.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.725
- We have to figure this out.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.725
- Figure what out?

07:13.767 --> 07:16.519
You're going to be bringing

07:13.767 --> 07:16.519
boys home now. We need a system.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.521
I'm not bringing "boys" home.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.521
I'm bringing boy home.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.440
- That boy, that's it.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.440
- I assume you're having sex.

07:20.481 --> 07:21.775
- Paris!

07:20.481 --> 07:21.775
- You're having sex.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.026
Well, luckily,

07:21.816 --> 07:23.026
I just bought

07:23.068 --> 07:24.194
some noise-reducing

07:23.068 --> 07:24.194
headphones.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.279
- So that'll help.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.279
- Oh, boy.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.529
If I put the headphones on

07:26.571 --> 07:27.864
and stuff some

07:26.571 --> 07:27.864
towels under the door

07:27.906 --> 07:28.949
that should do the trick.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.242
Hey, if you've got

07:28.990 --> 07:30.242
extra towels to stuff

07:30.284 --> 07:31.534
I got a location suggestion.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.203
- How loud are you?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.203
- Paris, stop.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.829
Look, I don't care, I

07:33.245 --> 07:34.829
just need the information

07:34.871 --> 07:36.206
to formulate a good plan.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.832
I mean, you look

07:36.248 --> 07:37.832
all small and squeaky

07:37.874 --> 07:39.709
but sometimes it's exactly

07:37.874 --> 07:39.709
the bunny-looking girls

07:39.751 --> 07:41.336
who can blow

07:39.751 --> 07:41.336
the roof off the barn.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.837
I know, just give me

07:41.378 --> 07:42.837
a three-minute warning.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.464
I'm walking away now.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.383
That way, I have time

07:44.505 --> 07:46.383
to put everything in place.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.051
- Put headphones on,<i> et cetera. </i>

07:46.425 --> 07:48.051
- Bye.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.429
Is he gonna come over

07:48.093 --> 07:50.429
a lot? Probably, right?

07:50.470 --> 07:51.846
'Cause' he's at his peak

07:50.470 --> 07:51.846
now, and it's probably

07:51.888 --> 07:53.014
one of the only things

07:51.888 --> 07:53.014
he's good at, so--

07:53.056 --> 07:54.891
- Three minute warning.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.891
- Right.

07:54.933 --> 07:57.852
[instrumental music]

08:02.983 --> 08:03.942
[indistinct chattering]

08:03.984 --> 08:05.485
- Bread.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.485
- That's $1.10.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.654
- So, we're at $17.33.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.654
- And jam.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.030
- Generic.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.030
- Yes, mom.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.574
$1.40, so we're at $18.73.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.827
Yo, John Nash,

08:11.616 --> 08:13.827
enough with the numbers.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.536
I'm just keeping track

08:13.868 --> 08:15.536
so we don't go over.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.122
It's too much pressure.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.122
I can't think.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.873
If we use coupons,

08:17.164 --> 08:18.873
it would stretch our money.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.251
Dude, the only thing more

08:18.915 --> 08:21.251
un-rock and roll than coupons

08:21.293 --> 08:22.836
is that shirt

08:21.293 --> 08:22.836
you're wearing.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.504
I've asked you about this shirt.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.504
You never said anything.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.173
We're not using coupons.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.507
Get enough brewskis

08:26.214 --> 08:27.507
there, buddy?

08:27.548 --> 08:29.343
Don't worry, I'm using

08:27.548 --> 08:29.343
my own money for this.

08:29.384 --> 08:30.718
- Okay, just..

08:29.384 --> 08:30.718
- Just what?

08:30.760 --> 08:31.845
I'm not sure

08:30.760 --> 08:31.845
why you need

08:31.886 --> 08:32.887
all that beer,

08:31.886 --> 08:32.887
that's all.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.264
We've got

08:32.929 --> 08:34.264
gigs coming up

08:34.306 --> 08:35.723
and I've kinda learned

08:34.306 --> 08:35.723
through experience

08:35.765 --> 08:37.058
that if you say

08:35.765 --> 08:37.058
to people, "Hey

08:37.100 --> 08:38.518
wanna come back

08:37.100 --> 08:38.518
for some beers?"

08:38.559 --> 08:40.103
And you don't have beer,

08:38.559 --> 08:40.103
they get pissed and leave.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.646
- People.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.646
- Right.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.273
- Meaning girls.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.273
- I would prefer it be girls.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.858
Good, okay. Well,

08:43.315 --> 08:44.858
stock up then, Hef.

08:44.899 --> 08:45.942
Get some extra

08:44.899 --> 08:45.942
for Jimmy Caan.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.277
Hey, guys. How you doing?

08:47.319 --> 08:48.487
Great, hope you're

08:47.319 --> 08:48.487
not here for beer

08:48.528 --> 08:49.654
'cause I think we're

08:48.528 --> 08:49.654
buying it all up.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.114
I'm just here for diapers.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.407
Any of your girlfriends

08:51.156 --> 08:52.407
need diapers?

08:52.449 --> 08:54.034
- What is your problem?

08:52.449 --> 08:54.034
- Problem?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.827
No problem.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.120
Milk.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.788
Lane, that was

08:57.162 --> 08:58.788
a real brand. Lane!

08:58.830 --> 09:02.501
That makes 27, 28, 29,

08:58.830 --> 09:02.501
30, and 10 makes 40.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.086
And here, here, take

09:02.542 --> 09:05.086
a balloon for the little miss.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.713
Election's on Tuesday.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.507
Morning, Maggie,

09:06.754 --> 09:08.507
how's the family?

09:08.548 --> 09:11.092
They're a pain in my rear.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.092
Don't say I said that.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.469
- Morning, Jackson.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.469
- Hi, Taylor.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.887
Hey, are these the best you got?

09:13.928 --> 09:14.929
Unfortunately, October's

09:14.971 --> 09:16.639
a terrible time for tomatoes.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.975
I guess I could always go

09:16.681 --> 09:18.975
with canned. I hate canned.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.601
Hey, if you need

09:19.017 --> 09:20.601
any more, Taylor

09:20.643 --> 09:22.229
I got a nice crop of tomatoes,

09:20.643 --> 09:22.229
plenty to go around.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.522
We could work something out.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.315
Well, that's nice

09:23.563 --> 09:25.315
of you to offer.

09:25.357 --> 09:28.109
You're growing them in that

09:25.357 --> 09:28.109
big new greenhouse, right?

09:28.151 --> 09:29.403
Built it with

09:28.151 --> 09:29.403
my own two hands.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.862
That's very industrious.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.322
Too bad about what's

09:30.904 --> 09:32.322
happening with all that.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.948
Yeah. What?

09:33.990 --> 09:36.326
- Nice cukes, though.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.326
- Beautiful cukes.

09:36.368 --> 09:39.746
I love cukes in a tricolore

09:36.368 --> 09:39.746
salad, adds a nice crunch.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.915
Uh, too bad about

09:39.787 --> 09:41.915
all what, Taylor?

09:41.956 --> 09:44.543
Oh, you know...the greenhouse.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.420
The greenhouse?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.420
What about the greenhouse?

09:46.461 --> 09:47.921
Wait, aren't the cukes

09:46.461 --> 09:47.921
three for a dollar?

09:47.962 --> 09:49.881
- They're two for a dollar.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.881
- It said three.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.925
Barry, I need a price

09:49.923 --> 09:51.925
check on cucumbers.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.843
- Taylor?

09:51.966 --> 09:53.843
- Jackson, please.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.345
This is not the proper forum

09:55.387 --> 09:57.180
to discuss the problem

09:55.387 --> 09:57.180
with your greenhouse.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.473
What problem?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.225
Barry, if you hear me,

09:58.515 --> 10:00.225
yell 10-4.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.352
I'll check the price on

10:00.267 --> 10:02.352
the stupid cucumbers, Taylor!

10:02.394 --> 10:03.978
Just tell me what's up

10:02.394 --> 10:03.978
with the greenhouse!

10:04.020 --> 10:06.064
Jackson, this is

10:04.020 --> 10:06.064
my place of business.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.982
The unpleasantness

10:06.106 --> 10:07.982
with your structure

10:08.024 --> 10:09.859
will all be settled

10:08.024 --> 10:09.859
at the next town meeting.

10:09.901 --> 10:11.486
I'm not hearing a 10-4, Barry.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.738
I can't go to the town meeting.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.738
I'm watching the baby.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.116
Oh, I'd get

10:13.780 --> 10:16.116
a babysitter if I was you.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.534
(Barry)

10:16.157 --> 10:17.534
'10-4!'

10:17.576 --> 10:19.411
You were out smoking again,

10:17.576 --> 10:19.411
weren't you, Barry?

10:19.453 --> 10:20.745
- 'No.'

10:19.453 --> 10:20.745
- Don't lie.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.373
- I'll smell your breath.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.373
- '10-4.'

10:23.415 --> 10:26.543
I don't like

10:23.415 --> 10:26.543
the tone of that "10-4."

10:26.585 --> 10:28.128
(Lane on phone)

10:26.585 --> 10:28.128
'I usually like

10:26.585 --> 10:28.128
grocery shopping.'

10:28.169 --> 10:29.796
'This stripped it

10:28.169 --> 10:29.796
of all enjoyment.'

10:29.837 --> 10:31.506
I thought you hated grocery

10:29.837 --> 10:31.506
shopping with the guys.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.800
- You always bicker.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.800
- But that's fun bickering.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.969
That's bickering we'll

10:33.841 --> 10:35.969
look back on in 20 years

10:36.010 --> 10:38.346
slap each other on the backs

10:36.010 --> 10:38.346
and say, "What ho, good times."

10:38.388 --> 10:40.181
So, you'll be Dickens

10:38.388 --> 10:40.181
characters in 20 years?

10:40.223 --> 10:43.017
You know what I mean, I know,

10:40.223 --> 10:43.017
I have no right to be bothered

10:43.059 --> 10:45.312
by Zach luring women back to

10:43.059 --> 10:45.312
the apartment with cheap beer

10:45.353 --> 10:47.230
because I haven't

10:45.353 --> 10:47.230
told him I like him.

10:47.272 --> 10:49.941
I mean, if I<i> had</i> told him I

10:47.272 --> 10:49.941
like him and he was doing that

10:49.983 --> 10:51.610
he'd be a creep

10:49.983 --> 10:51.610
of the first order.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.070
As it is, he's just

10:51.651 --> 10:54.070
exhibiting basic guy behavior

10:54.112 --> 10:56.615
grunt, grunt,

10:54.112 --> 10:56.615
caveman stuff, which

10:56.656 --> 10:58.325
to be honest, is a bit

10:56.656 --> 10:58.325
of the appeal of Zach.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.160
- So why don't you tell him?

10:58.366 --> 11:00.160
- 'There's a danger here.'

11:00.201 --> 11:02.787
- The roommate thing.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.787
- The band thing.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.539
Need I mention

11:02.829 --> 11:04.539
the rock and roll casualties

11:04.581 --> 11:05.582
from intra-band dating?

11:05.624 --> 11:06.916
I know they're numerous.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.251
Not that there's

11:06.958 --> 11:08.251
not success stories.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.710
I mean, you've got your Cramps

11:09.752 --> 11:12.005
your Yo La Tengos,

11:09.752 --> 11:12.005
your Kim and Thurstons.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.256
Sonny and Cher, the early years.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.299
Plus, you've got bands

11:14.341 --> 11:15.716
that have survived breakups.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.968
- No Doubt.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.968
- Wish they hadn't.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.970
X, Supertramp,

11:17.010 --> 11:18.970
The White Stripes.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.221
But in the negative, you have..

11:20.263 --> 11:21.640
Sonny and Cher,

11:20.263 --> 11:21.640
the later years.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.724
Jefferson Airplane,

11:21.680 --> 11:23.724
Fleetwood Mac.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.310
I know of two

11:23.766 --> 11:25.310
country music stars

11:25.352 --> 11:27.145
whose backup singers

11:25.352 --> 11:27.145
shot 'em in the groin.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.147
Whoa. That's wicked hate.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.524
- My batteries are dead.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.524
- Hang on, Lane.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.108
- Your batteries?

11:30.565 --> 11:32.108
- For my headphones.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.943
- When's Dean getting here?

11:32.150 --> 11:33.943
- Calm down, Paris.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.612
We're just gonna watch a movie

11:33.985 --> 11:35.612
and you're welcome to join us.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.197
Please. You're 19.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.324
Unless it's "Shoah"

11:37.238 --> 11:39.324
you two are getting carnal.

11:40.992 --> 11:42.827
- Sorry. You were saying?

11:40.992 --> 11:42.827
- You've got the data.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.246
- Now I need insight.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.246
- I think, you should tell him.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.831
This is not going away,

11:45.288 --> 11:46.831
so find the right moment

11:46.873 --> 11:48.166
and see what he says,

11:46.873 --> 11:48.166
and don't mention

11:48.208 --> 11:49.584
all that intra-band

11:48.208 --> 11:49.584
dating stuff.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.628
- Just follow your heart.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.628
- Heart, oh.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.838
The girls in Heart really

11:51.670 --> 11:53.838
screwed things up big-time.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.216
Hang on. Hello?

11:56.257 --> 11:58.968
- Hey, it's me.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.968
- Hey, you about on your way?

11:59.010 --> 12:01.513
Unfortunately, no.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.513
I have no way to get there.

12:01.555 --> 12:02.805
Oh, what happened to your car?

12:02.847 --> 12:05.266
Uh, nothing. It's just, um..

12:05.308 --> 12:06.434
Lindsay needed it.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.895
- Oh, right.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.895
- I don't know what for.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.313
She just needed it

12:08.936 --> 12:10.313
for some reason

12:10.355 --> 12:11.814
and we're still

12:10.355 --> 12:11.814
kind of sharing it.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.107
Right. Drag.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.150
(Dean on phone)

12:13.149 --> 12:14.150
'I'll look to see'

12:14.192 --> 12:15.569
'if there's a bus or something.'

12:15.610 --> 12:17.487
- That could take hours.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.487
- 'Yeah.'

12:17.529 --> 12:18.655
You want to come here?

12:18.697 --> 12:20.365
To Stars Hollow? How?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.283
Drive. You got your car.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.327
Oh, yeah, I do.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.327
Yeah, no, of course.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.787
Um, I have a car,

12:24.369 --> 12:26.787
and I'll drive to you.

12:26.829 --> 12:30.166
- Good. I mean, if you want to.

12:26.829 --> 12:30.166
- Definitely.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.586
Yeah, and now Paris doesn't

12:30.208 --> 12:32.586
have to go get batteries.

12:32.627 --> 12:33.628
- 'What?'

12:32.627 --> 12:33.628
- Uh, nothing.

12:33.670 --> 12:34.837
I'll see you in about an hour?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.047
- My place?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.047
- 'See you there.'

12:36.089 --> 12:37.048
Bye.

12:38.341 --> 12:39.509
- Sorry.

12:38.341 --> 12:39.509
- That's okay.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.719
Listen, I'm gonna play you

12:40.759 --> 12:42.345
two Rilo Kiley songs

12:42.387 --> 12:44.972
one pre-Jenny/Blake

12:42.387 --> 12:44.972
breakup, one post.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.225
Tell me if you hear

12:45.014 --> 12:47.225
a quality difference.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.437
♪ I used to think.. ♪

12:50.478 --> 12:53.189
The ferocity of

12:50.478 --> 12:53.189
attack is not affected

12:53.231 --> 12:56.401
by whether they're in

12:53.231 --> 12:56.401
the larval or nymphal life stage

12:56.443 --> 12:59.195
or whether they're of the one,

12:56.443 --> 12:59.195
two, or three host variety.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.822
Oh, I hate this,

12:59.237 --> 13:01.822
Taylor. Every year.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.782
Yeah, we get it,

13:01.864 --> 13:03.782
ticks are bad.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.619
Well, maybe people

13:03.824 --> 13:05.619
who are new to our town

13:05.660 --> 13:07.078
thus, new to

13:05.660 --> 13:07.078
the town meeting

13:07.120 --> 13:09.247
don't know the hazards

13:07.120 --> 13:09.247
of the common tick.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.832
Ticks are bad!

13:09.289 --> 13:11.832
Moving on!

13:11.874 --> 13:13.792
Don't hate

13:11.874 --> 13:13.792
the tick messenger.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.963
Hate the tick.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.963
Now, to continue.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.215
He's ruined the word

13:17.004 --> 13:19.215
"nymphal" for me forever.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.635
Four bucks an hour to

13:19.257 --> 13:21.635
a babysitter for a tick lecture?

13:21.676 --> 13:23.052
Don't worry, honey.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.052
He'll get to us.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.429
Waste of time.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.307
That's when a tick

13:24.471 --> 13:27.307
clamps onto his host

13:27.348 --> 13:29.392
plunges his hypostome

13:27.348 --> 13:29.392
into the skin

13:29.434 --> 13:31.810
and feasts on

13:29.434 --> 13:31.810
his next blood meal.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.187
[indistinct chattering]

13:33.229 --> 13:35.315
You take too much

13:33.229 --> 13:35.315
delight in this, Taylor.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.108
Go on, Taylor.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.108
He's sucking out the blood.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.737
They feed for extensive

13:37.150 --> 13:40.737
periods and at large volumes

13:40.779 --> 13:43.740
up to 500 times

13:40.779 --> 13:43.740
their body weight.

13:43.782 --> 13:47.076
This would be the equivalent

13:43.782 --> 13:47.076
of a 150-pound man

13:47.118 --> 13:50.829
drinking 9,000 gallons

13:47.118 --> 13:50.829
of human blood.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.831
Taylor, please!

13:50.871 --> 13:52.831
We get it!

13:52.873 --> 13:55.460
Oh, let's just vote on whatever

13:52.873 --> 13:55.460
it is you want us to vote on.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.003
- Before I hurl.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.003
- Yeah.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.087
Fine.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.673
The question before us is

13:59.714 --> 14:02.467
shall the town incur

13:59.714 --> 14:02.467
the expense of posting signs

14:02.509 --> 14:05.303
urging residents to tuck

14:02.509 --> 14:05.303
their pants into their socks

14:05.345 --> 14:06.346
during tick season?

14:06.387 --> 14:08.473
In favor?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.767
Opposed?

14:10.809 --> 14:12.143
The measure is defeated

14:12.185 --> 14:16.272
by an irresponsible,

14:12.185 --> 14:16.272
devil-may-care majority.

14:16.314 --> 14:19.025
Now we move on

14:16.314 --> 14:19.025
to the next item

14:19.066 --> 14:21.152
the matter of

14:19.066 --> 14:21.152
the town Stars Hollow

14:21.194 --> 14:24.698
versus land parcel 1-1-4-2-3-A.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.658
Is the parcel holder present?

14:26.700 --> 14:28.034
If that's me, I'm here.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.244
(Taylor)

14:28.075 --> 14:30.244
The parcel holder is present.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.205
Now, said parcel is cited

14:32.246 --> 14:35.458
as being in violation

14:32.246 --> 14:35.458
of section 4-2-3

14:35.500 --> 14:39.379
subsection 4C,

14:35.500 --> 14:39.379
subsection 32-B

14:39.420 --> 14:42.965
'formerly known as

14:39.420 --> 14:42.965
section 4-2-4, subsection--'

14:43.007 --> 14:44.258
- Enough!

14:43.007 --> 14:44.258
- Yeah.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.719
This is more

14:44.300 --> 14:45.719
painful than ticks!

14:45.760 --> 14:47.094
So the parcel

14:45.760 --> 14:47.094
holder requests that

14:47.136 --> 14:48.137
the reading of

14:47.136 --> 14:48.137
the citation be waived?

14:48.179 --> 14:49.180
Waive it. Waive it.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.223
Just tell me what the hell

14:50.264 --> 14:51.850
is wrong with my greenhouse.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.476
It's built too close

14:51.891 --> 14:53.476
to the edge of your property.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.603
It's miles away from

14:53.518 --> 14:55.603
the edge of my property.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.397
It's nine and a half feet

14:55.645 --> 14:57.397
from the edge of your property.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.648
Exactly.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.567
According to town codes,

14:58.690 --> 15:00.567
no new structure

15:00.608 --> 15:02.652
can come within ten feet

15:00.608 --> 15:02.652
of the edge of your property.

15:02.694 --> 15:06.113
- Oh, that's a technicality.

15:02.694 --> 15:06.113
- No, that's the law.

15:06.155 --> 15:09.784
And as town selectman, it's up

15:06.155 --> 15:09.784
to me to see that you abide it.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.494
Unbelievable!

15:11.536 --> 15:14.414
There's a simple solution,

15:11.536 --> 15:14.414
if you want to hear it.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.625
- I do, yes.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.625
- Just move it over six inches.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.378
Oh, well, you should

15:17.667 --> 15:20.378
have just said that before.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.838
Yeah, perhaps I should have.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.173
- Just move it over six inches?

15:21.880 --> 15:24.173
- 'That's right.'

15:24.215 --> 15:26.760
Good thing I built it on wheels

15:24.215 --> 15:26.760
so I could just scooch it over.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.345
- No, it's not on wheels!

15:29.387 --> 15:31.180
Because wheels

15:29.387 --> 15:31.180
would have been handy.

15:31.222 --> 15:34.642
I would have to tear it down to

15:31.222 --> 15:34.642

15:34.684 --> 15:37.395
Mmm. Too bad you didn't check

15:34.684 --> 15:37.395
with me before you built it.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.813
Could have saved

15:37.437 --> 15:38.813
you some heartache.

[stuttering]

15:40.189 --> 15:42.024
Okay, that's not English, hon.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.735
Come on, Taylor.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.735
This is ridiculous.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.695
This issue is not

15:43.777 --> 15:45.695
open for debate.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.988
This is a nice man who is

15:45.737 --> 15:47.988
growing some very nice tomatoes

15:48.030 --> 15:49.824
and you just need

15:48.030 --> 15:49.824
to oil your knees

15:49.866 --> 15:52.660
and go-go see the wizard

15:49.866 --> 15:52.660
and get a heart and drop this!

15:56.330 --> 15:57.832
Well, come on, you rejected it

15:57.874 --> 15:59.584
because I left

15:57.874 --> 15:59.584

15:59.626 --> 16:01.252
How many other

15:59.626 --> 16:01.252

16:01.294 --> 16:03.296
Well, there's your daughter.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.214
Okay. So you know two.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.133
Bet you can't name a third.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.133
Unless you knew my grandma.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.093
I think it's about time

16:07.174 --> 16:09.093
to adjourn this meeting.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.762
Oh, we're not done

16:09.135 --> 16:10.762
with this, Taylor!

16:10.804 --> 16:13.347
- I think we are.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.347
- Don't bang that gavel!

16:13.389 --> 16:15.558
Your issue is not with me.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.895
I am merely the humble vessel

16:15.600 --> 16:18.895
for the municipal code.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.980
Maybe it's time for

16:18.937 --> 16:20.980
a different vessel.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.523
- Where's he going?

16:21.021 --> 16:22.523
- Not sure.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.442
- A different vessel?

16:22.565 --> 16:24.442
- That's right.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.153
A different vessel. I'm running.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.489
- For what?

16:27.194 --> 16:29.489
- For whatever it is you are.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.324
- What are you again?

16:29.530 --> 16:31.324
- Town selectman.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.827
I'm running for

16:31.365 --> 16:33.827

16:33.868 --> 16:36.913
- Nobody runs against Taylor.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.913
- He's our Papa Doc.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.790
Uh, hon, shouldn't we

16:36.955 --> 16:38.790
maybe talk about this?

16:38.832 --> 16:40.166
Well, I accept

16:38.832 --> 16:40.166
the challenge.

16:40.207 --> 16:43.461
And I look forward

16:40.207 --> 16:43.461
to a lively race.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.755

the correct sampling size

21:34.418 --> 21:36.921
Thanks, Kirk.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.131
You did notice that

21:36.963 --> 21:38.131
the back of his pants

21:38.172 --> 21:39.339
are shorter than the front?

21:39.381 --> 21:40.883
- How does that happen?

21:39.381 --> 21:40.883
- That's Kirk.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.342
Huh. It certainly is.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.262
Hey, excuse me,

21:42.384 --> 21:44.262
but my customers

21:44.303 --> 21:46.222
aren't getting in the way

21:44.303 --> 21:46.222
of your thing here, are they?

21:46.264 --> 21:48.057
- Uh, no, they're fine.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.057
- Good.

21:48.099 --> 21:50.017
'Cause I can kick 'em

21:48.099 --> 21:50.017
out or-or close down

21:50.059 --> 21:51.060
for you if you'd like.

21:51.102 --> 21:52.603
That's sweet, but we're good.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.188
Okay, so you'll tell me if my

21:54.230 --> 21:55.397
business is in your way?

21:55.439 --> 21:56.774
You'll be

21:55.439 --> 21:56.774
the first to know.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.151
Ooh, Lane. Great.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.193
Do you think your

21:58.192 --> 21:59.193
band could play

21:59.235 --> 22:00.486
at Jackson's

21:59.235 --> 22:00.486
rally next week?

22:00.527 --> 22:01.528
It's not a lot of cash

22:01.570 --> 22:02.571
'but it's a little something'

22:02.613 --> 22:03.948
'in primetime placement.'

22:03.990 --> 22:05.449
- Absolutely.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.449
- Great. Jackson picked a song.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.533
So I'll get

22:05.491 --> 22:06.533
that info to you.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.410
Cool. Thanks.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.955
Okay, maybe you were missing

22:08.452 --> 22:10.955
my subtle sarcasm there

22:10.997 --> 22:12.790
when I mentioned my

22:10.997 --> 22:12.790
customers bein' in your way?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.041
Oh, no. I didn't

22:12.832 --> 22:14.041
miss it at all.

22:14.083 --> 22:15.584
Get your war room outta here.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.462
Hey, this is for a good cause.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.462
Taylor bugs you too.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.298
- Yes, he bugs me.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.298
- 'Okay, then.'

22:20.339 --> 22:22.508
We're trying to get rid

22:20.339 --> 22:22.508
of your little annoyance.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.135
By becoming my new

22:22.549 --> 22:24.135
little annoyance?

22:24.177 --> 22:26.137
(Lorelai)

22:24.177 --> 22:26.137
'Oh, hey,

22:24.177 --> 22:26.137
the night of the rally'

22:26.179 --> 22:28.388
we're gonna need a sort of

22:26.179 --> 22:28.388
backstage gathering area.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.516
- You cannot gather here.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.516
- But it's right across from--

22:30.557 --> 22:33.102
- You cannot gather here.

22:30.557 --> 22:33.102
- See, the stage is right over--

22:33.144 --> 22:35.229
- You cannot gather here.

22:33.144 --> 22:35.229
- Do you like my hair like this?

22:35.271 --> 22:37.273
Yes, and you cannot gather here.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.900
Wow. Sleeping with you

22:37.315 --> 22:39.900
is getting me nothing.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.319
Alright, just

22:39.942 --> 22:41.319
gather your crap up

22:41.359 --> 22:43.696
get it out. I need the tables.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.781
Quick, give me the baby.

22:45.823 --> 22:47.283
Ooh.

22:47.325 --> 22:50.203
Oh ho ho.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.038
Is he gonna sell it?

22:53.831 --> 22:56.292
Oh. That's it, Davey.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.418
Work it, work it.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.671
Do the clapping,

22:58.460 --> 23:00.671
do the clapping.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.799
Hmm. Very

23:00.713 --> 23:03.799
"Manchurian Candidate" of you.

23:03.841 --> 23:06.552
Free ice cream! Come

23:03.841 --> 23:06.552
and get your free ice cream.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.428
Compliments of Taylor Doose

23:08.470 --> 23:11.057
of Taylor's Old-Fashioned

23:08.470 --> 23:11.057
Soda Shoppe And Candy Store.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.683
[laughs]

23:11.098 --> 23:12.683
No need to rush, folks.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.519
There's plenty of free,

23:12.725 --> 23:15.519
fresh, handmade ice cream

23:15.561 --> 23:18.856
for every single registered

23:15.561 --> 23:18.856
voter in Stars Hollow.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.816
- How dirty.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.816
- I know.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.902
All he needed were some

23:20.858 --> 23:22.902
lying swift boat captains

23:22.943 --> 23:24.111
'to complete the ambush.'

23:24.153 --> 23:26.030
- Now we're gonna lose.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.030
- No, no.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.824
Now...he may have the edge,

23:26.072 --> 23:28.824
but we've got the heart.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.159
Who the hell cares about heart?

23:30.201 --> 23:31.451
We do, and people will.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.786
We just have to stay focused

23:32.828 --> 23:35.873
and-and do this

23:32.828 --> 23:35.873
one vote at a time.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.624
(Sookie)

23:35.915 --> 23:37.624
'Who are you calling?

23:35.915 --> 23:37.624
Ben Affleck?'

23:38.458 --> 23:39.459
Hey, uh, hey..

23:39.501 --> 23:41.045
Oh, hello, my favorite daughter.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.463
- What do you need?

23:41.087 --> 23:43.463
- 'I need you to come home.'

23:43.505 --> 23:44.757
- Now?

23:43.505 --> 23:44.757
- No, Tuesday.

23:44.798 --> 23:45.966
What's on Tuesday?

23:46.008 --> 23:47.801
Well, it's the town selectman

23:47.843 --> 23:49.178
elections and we're desperate.

23:49.220 --> 23:51.305
Lane's band is playing

23:49.220 --> 23:51.305
and I'll give you a button.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.056
- I'll be there.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.266
- 'Really?'

23:52.098 --> 23:53.266
- Yeah.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.351
- I'm a sucker for a button.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.351
- Thanks, kid.

23:55.393 --> 23:56.643
(Rory on phone)

23:55.393 --> 23:56.643
'Tell Jackson I'm

23:55.393 --> 23:56.643
rooting for him.'

23:56.685 --> 23:59.772
I will. Um...so, how's school?

23:59.813 --> 24:01.607
- So far, so good.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.607
- And how's Paris?

24:01.648 --> 24:03.859
Asher left her a 300-pound

24:01.648 --> 24:03.859
antique printing press

24:03.901 --> 24:05.027
which she put in

24:03.901 --> 24:05.027
the common room.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.362
- So, same?

24:05.069 --> 24:06.362
- Exactly.

24:06.404 --> 24:08.239
(Lorelai on phone)

24:06.404 --> 24:08.239
'Great. Okay.'

24:08.281 --> 24:12.201
And, um...how's Dean?

24:12.243 --> 24:14.954
- He's fine.

24:12.243 --> 24:14.954
- Okay, well, good.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.997
Mom, I have to study.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.997
I'll see you Tuesday, okay?

24:17.039 --> 24:19.250
Okay, see you Tuesday.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.419
Okay, uh, so Rory's

24:19.292 --> 24:21.419
coming back to vote.

24:21.459 --> 24:25.256
So counting her, you, me,

24:21.459 --> 24:25.256
Jackson, and Kirk, that's five.

24:25.298 --> 24:26.882
Why did you say

24:25.298 --> 24:26.882
"How's Dean" like that?

24:26.924 --> 24:28.884
- Like what?

24:26.924 --> 24:28.884
- "How's Dean?"

24:28.926 --> 24:30.010
I did say it like

24:28.926 --> 24:30.010
that, didn't I?

24:30.052 --> 24:31.095
- 'Yep.'

24:30.052 --> 24:31.095
- I don't know.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.512
I think I'm trying so hard

24:32.554 --> 24:33.555
to make Rory think I'm

24:33.597 --> 24:34.974
totally cool with the situation

24:35.015 --> 24:36.350
that I end up sounding

24:36.392 --> 24:38.144
totally freaked out

24:36.392 --> 24:38.144
by the situation.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.895
You're totally cool

24:38.185 --> 24:39.895
with the situation?

24:39.937 --> 24:42.106
Well, I'm totally on my way

24:42.148 --> 24:44.942
to being totally cool

24:42.148 --> 24:44.942
with the situation.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.319
Here. Take him.

24:46.360 --> 24:48.486
He's politically

24:46.360 --> 24:48.486
useless to me.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.696
Oh.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.370

25:07.298 --> 25:08.841
- Oh, that's okay.

25:07.298 --> 25:08.841
- You sure?

25:08.882 --> 25:10.717
Yeah. I'm good. Just, um..

25:12.886 --> 25:14.388
- Wait.

25:12.886 --> 25:14.388
- What?

25:14.430 --> 25:16.807
- My hair.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.807
- Okay.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.809
- Is-is that..

25:16.849 --> 25:18.809
- Yeah, yeah.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.019
That's good.

25:21.603 --> 25:22.938
Damn it.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.315
- Let's just shift here.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.315
- What are you doing?

25:24.357 --> 25:26.025
I'm just trying

25:24.357 --> 25:26.025
to get your seat back.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.526
Oh, I can do that.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.526
I can do that.

25:28.568 --> 25:30.196
Oh! See, good, okay.

25:30.237 --> 25:32.406
So I'll just get,

25:30.237 --> 25:32.406
like, up here

25:32.448 --> 25:33.491
and then..

25:33.531 --> 25:35.784
Okay. Ow. Wait. Ow. Ow.

25:35.826 --> 25:37.161
Ow!

25:39.955 --> 25:41.499
Ow.

25:41.539 --> 25:43.583
[panting]

25:43.625 --> 25:45.585
This isn't working great.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.630
Sorry.

25:48.672 --> 25:49.882
Yeah.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.301
So..

25:52.343 --> 25:54.261
...what do you wanna do?

25:56.389 --> 25:57.681
I don't know.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.476
We could try going

25:57.723 --> 26:00.476
to your house or--

26:00.518 --> 26:02.269
No. My parents are there.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.730
Right. We could

26:02.311 --> 26:04.730
go to Luke's.

26:04.771 --> 26:07.107
He's dating my mom now,

26:04.771 --> 26:07.107
so I get seated right away.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.526
I don't want

26:07.149 --> 26:08.526
to go to Luke's.

26:08.566 --> 26:10.694
Okay, then,

26:08.566 --> 26:10.694
I'm out. Your turn.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.407
Maybe you should

26:12.405 --> 26:14.407
just take me home.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.159
Oh, okay.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.540
You know, Lane's band is

26:20.079 --> 26:22.540
playing at Jackson's rally

26:22.580 --> 26:25.042
and I thought maybe I'd

26:22.580 --> 26:25.042
come back to town to see it.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.544
- Maybe we could go together.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.544
- No.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.504
- I don't think so.

26:26.584 --> 26:28.504
- Oh, come on. It would be fun.

26:28.546 --> 26:29.547
At the very least,

26:28.546 --> 26:29.547
it could be loud.

26:29.587 --> 26:30.672
No, Rory!

26:30.714 --> 26:31.715
I don't wanna go parading

26:31.757 --> 26:32.758
our relationship all over town.

26:32.799 --> 26:33.800
I didn't say--

26:33.842 --> 26:34.843
I don't need to rub Lindsay's

26:34.885 --> 26:35.886
nose in it any more than

26:35.928 --> 26:37.471
I already have, okay?

26:37.513 --> 26:39.265
I wasn't trying to...rub

26:39.306 --> 26:40.974
Lindsay's nose in anything.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.600
I was just..

26:44.395 --> 26:46.522
I'll take you home.

Hey. Did I know

26:56.532 --> 26:58.784
you were coming home?

26:58.825 --> 27:00.244
No.

27:03.872 --> 27:04.873
I have to deal with James Joyce

first thing in the morning.

Is that okay?

The crashing or the dealing

27:07.334 --> 27:09.002
with James Joyce?

27:09.044 --> 27:11.589
- Crashing.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.589
- Absolutely. Crash away.

27:11.629 --> 27:14.883
- Need a helmet?

27:11.629 --> 27:14.883
- Just a pillow.

27:14.925 --> 27:15.926

41:06.631 --> 41:09.801
believe me when I tell you'

41:09.842 --> 41:14.013
you will have Taylor Doose

41:09.842 --> 41:14.013

Thank you, and God bless.

I would like to talk

41:26.525 --> 41:28.236
to you about the permit

41:28.278 --> 41:30.989
for expanding my dance studio

41:28.278 --> 41:30.989
to include a Tae Bo room.

41:31.030 --> 41:33.032
I have the pictures

41:31.030 --> 41:33.032
of the hedges right here.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.617
They're at least a foot above

41:33.074 --> 41:34.617
where they're supposed to be

41:34.659 --> 41:36.077

Hey.

Grabbed us a little

victory champagne

42:05.648 --> 42:08.109
and I thought..

42:08.151 --> 42:09.361
- You were asleep.

42:08.151 --> 42:09.361
- Oh, no, no.

42:09.402 --> 42:10.611
I was just, uh

42:10.653 --> 42:12.613
doing some...

42:10.653 --> 42:12.613
bills and things.

42:12.655 --> 42:13.948

42:12.655 --> 42:13.948
- Yeah.

- In the dark?

42:13.990 --> 42:17.535
- Trying to conserve.

42:17.576 --> 42:20.705
So, when you went up earlier,

42:17.576 --> 42:20.705
you were going to bed.

42:20.746 --> 42:22.581
'You go to bed early'

42:22.623 --> 42:24.459
which makes sense

42:22.623 --> 42:24.459
because you get up early.

Hey, don't you
