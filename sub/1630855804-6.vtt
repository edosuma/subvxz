[music intensifies]

00:27.166 --> 00:28.583
[neighs]

00:57.375 --> 00:59.666
Welcome to France, Your Magnificence.

01:00.166 --> 01:03.000
Your long and tedious journey
is almost over.

01:04.250 --> 01:05.458
[sighs]

01:05.541 --> 01:08.375
My sister the Moon burns brightly tonight.

01:09.625 --> 01:11.666
She's very excited, of course.

01:12.458 --> 01:16.708
Soon we will force our father,
Amun-Ra, the Sun,

01:17.291 --> 01:20.625
down on his knees
to grovel in the mud for mercy.

01:21.708 --> 01:24.083
But there will be no fucking mercy.

01:24.625 --> 01:29.458
I will cut off his head and suck out
his brains and spit them into the dust.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.708
[groans]

01:32.750 --> 01:35.000
They've always worshiped him.

01:35.625 --> 01:39.541
My father. The fucking Sun.

01:40.041 --> 01:43.375
Since they crawled out of caves,
mortals have adored him,

01:43.875 --> 01:46.458
because they are afraid of the dark.

01:47.583 --> 01:51.166
Soon there will be only darkness.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.916
And terror will be all they know.

01:56.041 --> 01:59.666
For now though, Countess,
the nights are short this far north.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.500
We still have a way to travel.

02:02.041 --> 02:02.958
Yes, yes.

02:03.458 --> 02:04.375
[groans]

02:04.458 --> 02:07.041
But I'm so thirsty, Drolta.

02:10.125 --> 02:11.666
[people whimpering]

02:16.500 --> 02:17.500
[whimpering]

02:20.166 --> 02:21.250
[gasps]

02:21.333 --> 02:24.458
[Drolta] Daughter
of a revolutionary deputy.

02:24.541 --> 02:26.666
A member of the Jacobin Club.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.500
-[woman whimpers]
-[Drolta] Lawyer.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.625
Liked the sound of his own voice.

02:30.708 --> 02:33.916
I'm told he begged for his own life
rather than hers.

02:34.000 --> 02:34.833
[whimpers]

02:39.541 --> 02:40.416

02:40.500 --> 02:41.916

02:43.791 --> 02:46.500
[Erzsebet] Oh. Oh, yes.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.666
Exquisite.

02:49.958 --> 02:52.416
I'm so bored of empty terror.

02:52.916 --> 02:55.375
-[sniffs, moans]
-[woman whimpers]

02:56.500 --> 02:59.458
-[Erzsebet] This is much, much sweeter.

03:30.750 --> 03:31.875
[Richter panting]

03:33.583 --> 03:37.291
Hold on.
I need some fucking answers, Granddad.

03:37.375 --> 03:39.708
[Juste] Please,
call me anything but granddad.

03:39.791 --> 03:43.833
Where the fuck have you been all my life?
I thought you were dead.

03:43.916 --> 03:45.250
I'm gonna kill Tera.

03:45.333 --> 03:48.541
I came to this country when I was 10,
knowing absolutely nobody.

03:48.625 --> 03:50.875
If it wasn't for Auntie Tera,
who isn't really my auntie,

03:50.958 --> 03:54.291
more some sort of third cousin
a thousand times removed--

03:54.375 --> 03:55.875
[Juste] We had a fucking deal.

03:57.750 --> 04:00.541
-What do you mean you're gonna kill her?
-[Juste sighs]

04:01.666 --> 04:04.500
She promised not to tell you
where to find me.

04:04.583 --> 04:05.958
What are you talking about?

04:07.833 --> 04:10.625
You mean, she didn't tell you?

04:11.500 --> 04:14.250
No! What? No-- No!

04:16.083 --> 04:17.416
[Juste] Uh…

04:18.416 --> 04:23.625
Well, in answer to your question,
where have I been all your life?

04:23.708 --> 04:27.458
I've been here all the time.
Since you came to France.

04:27.541 --> 04:29.125
Keeping an eye on you.

04:29.666 --> 04:32.166
You mean you've been watching me?
Secretly?

04:32.250 --> 04:35.833
Well, when you put it like that,
I suppose it sounds a bit creepy.

04:35.916 --> 04:37.375
[Richter] And Tera knew?

04:37.458 --> 04:39.083
She agreed not to tell you.

04:39.708 --> 04:41.458
I've been giving her money.

04:41.541 --> 04:42.708
And that was the deal?

04:42.791 --> 04:44.625
No, no, of course not.

04:45.125 --> 04:47.250
Uh, well, sort of.

04:47.333 --> 04:51.625
When I have a bit of money from killing
these stupid provincial vampires,

04:51.708 --> 04:53.708
I give her some to help out.

04:54.208 --> 04:56.875
But I asked her
not to tell you about me because…

04:56.958 --> 04:57.916
[inhales]

04:58.000 --> 04:59.916
Well, I thought it was for the best.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.875
You didn't want me to know
I had an actual fucking grandfather

05:03.958 --> 05:05.541
living a few miles away?

05:05.625 --> 05:08.875
No, I didn't.
You might expect things from me.

05:08.958 --> 05:12.416
Advice, encouragement, birthday presents.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.791
Who the hell wants that?

05:14.625 --> 05:16.083
My mother said you were dead.

05:16.833 --> 05:20.083
In fact, she never even mentioned you
except to say you were dead.

05:20.791 --> 05:23.750
She said she went to the New World
because there was no one else,

05:23.833 --> 05:25.958
and she was the heir
to the Belmont mission,

05:26.041 --> 05:28.833
and there were vampires there
she had to fight.

05:30.083 --> 05:31.041
Like Olrox.

05:37.208 --> 05:38.416
Where are you going now?

05:53.958 --> 05:55.250
You're a Belmont.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.708
You're not supposed to hide in a hut.

05:59.541 --> 06:02.125
And you're not supposed to kill
vampires for money.

06:06.541 --> 06:09.041
I was a hero… once.

06:10.541 --> 06:15.041
I lost count of how many vampires
I killed… "heroically."

06:17.166 --> 06:19.500
The whip was mine, then, of course.

06:20.291 --> 06:21.833
But I had other powers.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.208
One of our ancestors 300 years ago
was a great sorceress.

06:27.291 --> 06:29.375
Sypha, yes. I know.

06:29.916 --> 06:32.541
I know everything
about the history of our family.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.208
My mother taught me.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.625
And she left you out.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.708
I'm starting to see why.

06:39.791 --> 06:41.958
-[Juste chuckling]
-[gentle music playing]

06:42.625 --> 06:44.375
[Juste] You sound so much like her.

06:47.541 --> 06:51.291
I was the most powerful magician
the Belmont line ever produced.

06:52.041 --> 06:53.333
Barely needed the whip.

06:54.166 --> 06:57.833
I could roast a whole nest of them
with a burst of flame.

06:58.583 --> 07:01.416
[Richter] So, when did you turn
into this creepy old man?

07:02.958 --> 07:05.083
[Juste] Go outside. I'll bring you coffee.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.041
I think I've got another cup.

07:22.166 --> 07:24.166
[footsteps approaching]

07:38.416 --> 07:40.333
You said you were a powerful magician?

07:41.250 --> 07:42.625
Emphasis on the "were."

07:44.833 --> 07:45.958
I had a wife.

07:46.791 --> 07:49.250
Your grandmother, Lydie.

07:50.583 --> 07:53.250
And a friend too, if you can believe that.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.166
His name was Maxim.

07:57.416 --> 07:59.208
A vampire killed them both.

08:01.083 --> 08:02.000
[sighs]

08:02.625 --> 08:03.750
Lord Ruthven.

08:04.375 --> 08:09.416
God, that's a name
I haven't spoken aloud in years.

08:11.166 --> 08:15.708
I held her in my arms,
pleading with her to come back to me.

08:16.708 --> 08:17.791
"Come back to me."

08:19.791 --> 08:20.708
Holding her.

08:21.583 --> 08:22.458
So limp.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.250
So cold.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.333
So cold.

08:27.916 --> 08:33.500
And across the hall,
Maxim, my friend, butchered.

08:35.083 --> 08:37.000
And for a while, not quite dead.

08:39.625 --> 08:40.958
All because of me.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.041
The magic left me.

08:46.458 --> 08:47.625
I had nothing.

08:48.791 --> 08:50.500
Nothing left.

08:50.583 --> 08:54.083
You lost your daughter too.
Or have you forgotten that part?

08:54.625 --> 08:57.583
Your daughter who went
to America to fight evil alone.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.875
[mysterious music playing]

08:59.958 --> 09:01.875
Evil will always win, Richter.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.416
Whatever it is, evil.

09:06.958 --> 09:08.166
And it's everywhere.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.416
It will always be stronger than us.

09:12.750 --> 09:15.416
And you can kill this or that devil.

09:16.250 --> 09:22.250
A Lord Ruthven, a Dracula,
maybe even an Olrox.

09:23.791 --> 09:28.458
But there'll always be more,
more and worse.

09:29.083 --> 09:31.416
And they'll murder the people you love.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.875
[gentle, tragic music playing]

09:32.958 --> 09:34.708
No one around you are safe.

09:35.833 --> 09:38.708
Evil will always win.

09:44.750 --> 09:48.125
Why are you here then,
if you didn't come looking for me?

09:48.208 --> 09:49.041
[music fades]

09:49.125 --> 09:50.666
What are you doing here?

09:52.500 --> 09:53.750
[sobbing softly]

10:04.583 --> 10:06.583
[gloomy music playing]

[music fading]

11:08.416 --> 11:09.416
[exhales]

11:17.500 --> 11:19.333
You killed Vaublanc.

11:20.208 --> 11:21.958
We all rejoiced.

11:23.041 --> 11:24.166
But I lost Edouard.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.833
Though not his soul.

11:27.708 --> 11:29.375
Take courage from that.

11:33.750 --> 11:36.250
The Belmont boy
turned out to be useless as fuck.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.375
He literally ran away.

11:39.083 --> 11:40.541
Ran. Away.

11:40.625 --> 11:43.083
Everyone starts by running away, Annette.

11:43.166 --> 11:44.000
What?

11:44.583 --> 11:46.208
That is completely different.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.750
How can you possibly compare that?

11:50.458 --> 11:51.875
I came here for guidance.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.333
I thought I'd seen
the worst evil the world could hold.

11:55.416 --> 11:58.791
But here,
it's been growing roots for centuries.

11:58.875 --> 12:01.666
And this Vampire Messiah,
she's older still.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.875
Your power is old too, Annette.

12:05.833 --> 12:09.625
If these are my ancestors, Cecile,
they're just a babble. Noise.

12:09.708 --> 12:12.958
They are no match for some
ancient Egyptian Devil-God.

12:13.041 --> 12:16.583
They're only a babble
because you're not listening.

12:16.666 --> 12:18.416
[mysterious music playing]

12:18.500 --> 12:20.416
You were shaped, Annette.

12:20.500 --> 12:25.708
Everything about you,
by being born a slave.

12:25.791 --> 12:27.416
Of course you were.

12:28.041 --> 12:30.041
It's the source of your fury,

12:30.541 --> 12:32.958
but it's not the source of your power.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.541
They like to tell you,

12:35.625 --> 12:38.583
these petty devils
like the Comte de Vaublanc,

12:38.666 --> 12:41.916
that slavery is just the way of the world.

12:42.416 --> 12:43.625
It's what people do.

12:44.208 --> 12:48.125
And you can look around and think,
oh, maybe they're right.

12:48.666 --> 12:53.000
Evil, violence, and oppression everywhere.

12:53.083 --> 12:56.250
Even these French with their high ideals.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.875
What do they know
about what we've suffered?

12:58.958 --> 13:00.500
And what do they care?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.291
They'll build their new world,

13:03.375 --> 13:07.500
but it won't be freedom
or equality or brotherhood for us.

13:08.083 --> 13:09.458
If they build it at all.

13:10.083 --> 13:13.250
But they know it's not true, Annette.

13:13.958 --> 13:15.833
The petty devils.

13:15.916 --> 13:18.000
It serves them if we believe it.

13:18.666 --> 13:22.958
But humanity didn't enter this world
dragging armies of slaves.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.291
That came later.

13:26.291 --> 13:28.166
And your ancestors.

13:28.791 --> 13:33.541
Of course I mean your mother,
who loved you.

13:33.625 --> 13:34.958
And your father,

13:35.041 --> 13:37.916
who was dragged from her
by men with whips.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.125
And your grandmother,

13:40.208 --> 13:45.125
who watched the ships sail,
weeping and pulling her hair.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.875
[chuckles softly] But they go back.

13:48.500 --> 13:52.166
Beyond them and beyond them.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.541
Back to the source.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.958
To the Iwa of Ogun.

13:57.625 --> 14:01.625
And a world without slaves or masters.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.916
Learn to hear your ancestors.

14:08.083 --> 14:11.500
There is light in this darkness.

[chuckles] He's threatening you.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.166
Your reluctant demon.

15:12.166 --> 15:14.666
Why was the Belmont boy so afraid of you?

15:16.958 --> 15:20.583
I lived a long time as human and vampire.

15:21.458 --> 15:23.666
But I've only really loved once.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.875
He was from a little town
in Massachusetts,

15:27.958 --> 15:29.458
if you've ever heard of that.

15:29.958 --> 15:31.833
Which in those days, was a colony.

15:32.916 --> 15:34.541
But he wasn't a colonist.

15:35.166 --> 15:40.000
He was proud to be Mohican,
with roots deep in the land and forest.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.125
He burned with such passion.

15:44.166 --> 15:47.375
About the world, about how the people,

15:47.458 --> 15:49.666
"the people," that's how he talked,

15:50.208 --> 15:52.041
could win this thing called freedom.

15:53.041 --> 15:54.458
Even people like him.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.708
People whose land had been stolen, I mean.

15:59.916 --> 16:03.125
Like mine was, oh, so long ago.

16:04.208 --> 16:06.875
But he fought with them,
the revolutionaries.

16:06.958 --> 16:08.500
He fought with them.

16:09.916 --> 16:11.875
He almost made me believe in it too.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.833
Then Julia Belmont killed him.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.666
[Mizrak] Because he was a vampire.

16:19.541 --> 16:21.000
And you did that to him.

16:21.708 --> 16:24.833
-Did you even ask permission?
-I was in love with him.

16:25.833 --> 16:28.166
I wanted him to be with me forever.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.333
And is that what you have planned for me?

16:32.875 --> 16:34.541
Of course not, Mizrak.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.791
I'm not in love with you.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.541
[song ends]

16:50.250 --> 16:51.583
Who were you, friend?

16:52.916 --> 16:54.583
Do you remember who you were?

16:55.541 --> 16:57.541
[ominous music playing]

16:58.500 --> 17:01.291
[night creature] I remember
being out in the woods.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.041
And a girl who liked talking.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.708
I remember that I liked her.

17:11.083 --> 17:13.958
And I liked what she said.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.625
My name…

17:19.750 --> 17:20.958
was Jacques.

17:22.583 --> 17:23.750
[music continues]

17:31.291 --> 17:32.666
[breathes deeply]

17:38.041 --> 17:39.708
[music fades]

17:45.833 --> 17:46.708
Do they know?

17:47.541 --> 17:48.875
All of them? Do they know?

17:49.666 --> 17:51.375
[sighs] Of course not.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.333
Ashamed to tell them, are you?

17:53.416 --> 17:54.375
Why?

17:55.375 --> 17:56.375
I mean, you're a priest,

17:56.458 --> 17:58.833
so you're supposed to keep it
in your pants.

17:59.333 --> 18:03.458
But everyone knows most priests don't.
Most popes don't even.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.708
They are dishonorable priests.

18:05.791 --> 18:06.875
[chuckles]

18:06.958 --> 18:09.416
Fathering a few brats here and there
doesn't count for much

18:09.500 --> 18:11.541
compared to summoning devils from hell.

18:11.625 --> 18:12.958
Or does the Pope do that too?

18:13.041 --> 18:16.208
We do whatever we have to do
in the name of God.

18:16.291 --> 18:17.625
It was for God, was it?

18:17.708 --> 18:19.791
That you ignored me my whole life?

18:19.875 --> 18:22.208
I haven't ignored you, Maria.

18:23.541 --> 18:26.375
I know, for instance, that you're a witch.

18:26.958 --> 18:28.791
But I protected you anyway.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.833
You're not seriously accusing me
of black magic?

18:31.916 --> 18:33.666
[ominous music playing]

18:33.750 --> 18:34.583
[Abbot] Join me.

18:34.666 --> 18:35.791
[laughs]

18:36.833 --> 18:38.750
[Abbot] God moves through me, Maria.

18:39.541 --> 18:41.250
I implore you.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.125
Please, don't stand in God's way.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.666
-[vampire] Our savior is here!
-[gasps]

18:48.291 --> 18:50.208
[vampires] Our deliverer has come!

18:50.291 --> 18:52.666
Our deliverer!

18:52.750 --> 18:54.250
Down the Revolution!

18:54.333 --> 18:56.625
Praise be to God!

18:56.708 --> 18:57.833
Our savior!

18:57.916 --> 19:00.041
Salvation is here!

19:00.875 --> 19:02.125
Lift our soul!

19:02.208 --> 19:04.166
She's come to save us.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.541
Our savior!

19:05.625 --> 19:09.208
She's here! She's here! She's here!

19:09.291 --> 19:10.541
She's here!

19:10.625 --> 19:14.500
She will save us! She will save us!

19:14.583 --> 19:16.166
[all clamoring excitedly]

19:16.250 --> 19:17.416
[vampires] Deliver us!

19:17.500 --> 19:19.333
Down with the Revolution!

19:19.416 --> 19:21.083
[music peaks, fades]

19:21.833 --> 19:24.291
Long ago, when I was still human,

19:24.375 --> 19:28.916
I watched men wade ashore from ships
and slaughter my people.

19:30.041 --> 19:34.208
Slaughter them in their thousands,
millions in the end.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.750
Who could've believed such a thing?

19:39.208 --> 19:41.375
They said they were doing it
for their God.

19:42.125 --> 19:45.666
Sometimes their king too,
but always their God.

19:46.750 --> 19:48.125
But in the end…

19:48.916 --> 19:50.375
[chuckles]

19:50.458 --> 19:51.458
[inhales sharply]

19:52.083 --> 19:53.041
…there's only her.

19:54.041 --> 19:56.541
[vampires] Death to the Revolution!

19:56.625 --> 19:59.208
Down with the Revolution!

19:59.291 --> 20:02.000
-[crowd clamoring]
-[dramatic, gloomy music playing]

20:17.083 --> 20:18.625
I've been looking for you.

20:22.958 --> 20:25.041
[vampires chanting]
Death to the Revolution!

20:30.041 --> 20:31.750
He says this is God's plan.

20:37.166 --> 20:38.000
Have courage.

20:39.958 --> 20:41.666
There is light in this darkness.

20:45.333 --> 20:46.875
[Edouard] And in this prison,

20:46.958 --> 20:50.041
down here in the dark, Jacques.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.916
Standing guard over me.

20:54.208 --> 20:58.208
Do you accept it now, as your fate?

20:58.291 --> 21:00.291
[eerie music playing]

21:02.666 --> 21:03.500
[Jacques] No.

21:09.625 --> 21:10.625
[music fades]

21:17.750 --> 21:18.583
Was it quick?

21:20.375 --> 21:21.375
Julia's death?

21:22.458 --> 21:23.291
Was it quick?

21:25.416 --> 21:27.208
No, not really.

21:28.666 --> 21:30.791
She was looking right at me when she died.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.083
I could tell.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.583
I mean,
I could tell when her life stopped.

21:38.250 --> 21:40.458
I saw it in her eyes.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.791
The actual moment where it ended.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.250
And then Olrox let me go.

21:51.625 --> 21:53.541
[Juste] She was proud, your mother.

21:54.625 --> 21:56.166
She said she didn't need me.

21:56.958 --> 21:58.791
I would only slow her down.

21:58.875 --> 22:00.208
[inhales deeply]

22:00.291 --> 22:03.041
But, of course,
I should have gone with her anyway.

22:04.708 --> 22:06.291
I was a terrible father.

22:07.875 --> 22:08.750
But well…

22:08.833 --> 22:13.791
[chuckles dryly] …most important thing is
to face the truth about yourself.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.500
Even if it's not very pretty.

22:19.458 --> 22:20.416
[grunts]

22:21.791 --> 22:22.833
I need a piss.

22:35.875 --> 22:37.250
[Richter gasps softly]

23:41.875 --> 23:45.333
So then, here we are.

23:45.416 --> 23:49.916
-The Belmont Clan soon to be extinct.
-[Richter straining]

23:50.000 --> 23:51.166
[ominous music playing]

23:51.250 --> 23:56.416
What, are you going to beg
for his life first?

23:56.916 --> 23:59.416
[chuckles] Maybe not his.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.958
After all, you hardly know him.

24:03.791 --> 24:08.416
But back in Machecoul,
they're family, aren't they?

24:09.125 --> 24:10.166
Sort of.

24:10.250 --> 24:14.541
The little girl who isn't your sister
but is almost your sister.

24:15.333 --> 24:20.291
The Speaker woman who isn't your mother,
but has been like a mother to you.

24:21.208 --> 24:24.833
And the Black girl.
Wherever the fuck she is from.

24:25.875 --> 24:29.041
-You could beg for their lives.
-[gasps]

24:33.791 --> 24:35.500
[Nikolai chuckles]

24:35.583 --> 24:41.291
Not a lot of point begging to me though,
because it won't be me that kills them.

24:42.041 --> 24:47.250
That will be the gift
of the Devourer of Light.

24:48.666 --> 24:54.083
Often she hangs you by your arms
with hooks through the bones,

24:54.166 --> 24:57.958
making sure you don't bleed out too fast.

24:58.041 --> 25:00.708
You can be conscious for days.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.583
It's wonderful.

25:04.416 --> 25:06.333
If they're lucky,

25:06.416 --> 25:11.708
she'll turn them,
and then they'll never die.

25:12.958 --> 25:15.166
What do you think of that?

25:15.666 --> 25:18.875

27:12.458 --> 27:13.625
[Richter] Stupid of me,

27:40.875 --> 27:44.375
I was going to say something witty
and cutting and brutal

27:44.458 --> 27:46.000
before I finished you off.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.291
But fuck it.

28:10.625 --> 28:12.125
I can do magic again.

28:12.958 --> 28:13.958
I noticed.

28:14.958 --> 28:16.083
How did it happen?

28:17.833 --> 28:18.666
I don't know.

28:20.041 --> 28:21.208
Because I had to.

28:22.833 --> 28:24.041
I have to live.

28:25.750 --> 28:27.208
There are people I love.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.916
Pity it didn't work like that for you.

28:33.958 --> 28:35.333
I'm much younger than you.

28:37.166 --> 28:38.708
That's probably all it is.

28:40.333 --> 28:41.166
Yes.

28:43.958 --> 28:45.291
That's probably all it is.
