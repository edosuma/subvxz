WEBVTT

00:03.940 --> 00:05.780
Oh, Hyde, get this.

00:05.860 --> 00:07.700
Casey just came by
to pick up Donna...

00:07.780 --> 00:10.580
and he was out in the street
just revving his Trans Am real loud...

00:10.660 --> 00:12.500
and then he peels out
in the street...

00:12.580 --> 00:14.780
and he started
doing doughnuts.

00:14.820 --> 00:17.300
And then, out comes Donna,
all smiling...

00:17.380 --> 00:20.380
and, like,
looking at him.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.900
What a slut!

00:24.980 --> 00:27.700
Look. If she wants
to date him, that's fine.

00:27.780 --> 00:30.540
But he doesn't have to be
all loud and jerky about it.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.740
Jerky, loud, doughnut jerk.

00:36.420 --> 00:39.060
Oh, guess what, boys.

00:39.140 --> 00:43.260
I entered the big wiener contest
at the Piggly Wiggly.

00:43.300 --> 00:48.580
And I won a year's supply
of all-beef hot dogs!

00:48.660 --> 00:52.020
I'm a wiener winner!

00:53.460 --> 00:55.580
Well, anyway,
we're having a barbecue.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.820
No, Kitty! I thought we were
going to talk about that.

00:58.900 --> 01:02.260
Mm-hmm. Oh, and I saw Donna
at the grocery store...

01:02.340 --> 01:04.220
and she said she's bringing
her friend Casey.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.940
What? No.
I hate Casey.

01:06.980 --> 01:10.140
He's Donna's new boyfriend.
Y-You have to uninvite him. Dad, tell her.

01:10.180 --> 01:13.820
Kitty, you've done
a horrible thing.

01:14.780 --> 01:17.180
It could scar the boy
for life.

01:17.260 --> 01:19.900
Now, let's do the right thing
and cancel that barbecue.

01:21.260 --> 01:23.580
No. We're having it,
and it'll be fun.

01:25.220 --> 01:29.500
And... we just...
We won't give Casey any relish.

01:33.340 --> 01:35.180
All right!

01:35.260 --> 01:39.220
Once Casey finds out he's not getting
any relish, he'll dump Donna for sure.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.660
You are so screwed.

01:48.680 --> 01:51.960
So your mom invited Casey
over for hot dogs?

01:52.040 --> 01:54.520
Well, that's a plump,
juicy all-beef burn.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.520
Ah, it's just typical
women stuff.

01:59.560 --> 02:02.240
Like Jackie
kissing that guy. Ow!

02:03.400 --> 02:05.440
- Hyde!
- Yeah. Okay?

02:05.480 --> 02:08.000
I've decided if anyone brings up
any more stupid girl stuff...

02:08.080 --> 02:10.720
I'm gonna throw something
at 'em.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.920
This time, I threw a fist.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.160
I'm sorry. It's just
everything reminds me.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.200
Like, last night <i>Rocky</i> was on...

02:19.240 --> 02:23.480
and I was thinking I'm like Rocky
and Jackie is Apollo Creed.

02:27.120 --> 02:31.880
And she bashed in my face
by kissing that guy!

02:31.960 --> 02:34.520
At least Rocky
wins in the end.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.840
Kelso, Rocky loses.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.560
Oh, yeah? Well, why is he
jumping around all happy?

02:42.600 --> 02:45.480
Because he goes
the distance, fool.

02:46.520 --> 02:50.320
He loses the fight,
but he wins in life.

02:51.720 --> 02:54.680
Who wants to watch a movie
with a message like that?

02:55.840 --> 02:58.920
Ice-cream man!

03:04.560 --> 03:08.000
You guys, I've been thinking
about Donna. And I...

03:08.040 --> 03:10.720
This time I threw a magazine.

03:10.760 --> 03:14.600
No, guys, seriously.
This barbecue might work out in my favor.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.800
You see, Donna's only seen Casey
around his smelly, tattooed...

03:18.880 --> 03:22.280
Molly Hatchet-lovin' friends.

03:22.360 --> 03:24.600
But when he comes to the barbecue,
he'll be around us...

03:24.680 --> 03:27.680
good, clean,
Lynyrd Skynyrd-lovin' Americans.

03:27.720 --> 03:31.160
And the comparison
will not be kind to him.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.920
And then Donna'll come
running home to you.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.840
No.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.920
Well, maybe.
You think?

03:38.000 --> 03:42.840
So, instead of pounding Casey like you
should, you came up with this zany scheme.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.960
Forman, you've officially
turned into Daffy Duck.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.280
You're "dithpicable"!

03:51.640 --> 03:53.640
You know, I have
lady problems too.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.760
Rhonda won't let me
get past second base.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.840
I even said, "please."

04:07.880 --> 04:10.600
Magic word, my ass!

04:12.000 --> 04:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:19.560 --> 04:22.640
Y-You know what,
Jac... I can't do this.

04:22.720 --> 04:26.640
Why should I paint these round, berry toes if
some other guy is gonna end up lickin' 'em?

04:28.280 --> 04:30.120
Michael, what are you
talking about?

04:30.200 --> 04:32.720
I still can't get over
you cheatin' on me.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.640
And I need to hear you
apologize again.

04:34.720 --> 04:38.840
And this time, maybe you
should cry or give me money!

04:38.920 --> 04:41.920
No, Michael.
I am not gonna beg for forgiveness.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.880
I didn't make <i>you</i> do that
when you cheated.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.680
Well, that is
totally different.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.480
When guys cheat, it's because
they need some hot action.

04:53.120 --> 04:58.080
But when girls cheat, it's way worse,
'cause girls don't even like sex.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.680
We do too.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.400
Well, why aren't we
doin' it now?

05:05.480 --> 05:07.360
Because I don't want to
do it right now.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.440
I do. Point made.
Thank you!

05:13.120 --> 05:14.960
No. You know what?
We need help.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.680
We should consult the world's
highest authority on relationships.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.600
<i>Cosmo!</i>

05:24.000 --> 05:26.560
"Why you should touch
your breasts every day."

05:33.000 --> 05:35.240
No, this could help.
They seem smart.

05:39.480 --> 05:44.760
Okay, Fez, when Casey gets here, ask him
for advice about your second-base problem.

05:44.840 --> 05:48.120
My advice is gonna be
way better than his, and, uh...

05:48.200 --> 05:51.240
Donna will see that
he's a greasy dolt.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.920
Hey, Forman,
I have an idea.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.120
Set up a wacky system
of ropes and pulleys...

05:57.200 --> 06:00.440
and when Casey gets here,
drop an anvil on his head.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.800
- Because that's what Daffy does.
- Yeah, I got that.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.160
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.240
Hey, Foreplay.
Getting a little shaggy up there, buddy.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.640
Okay. Well, that's
enough of that!

06:17.720 --> 06:19.560
Okay.
So, uh...

06:19.640 --> 06:21.600
Hey, you guys
are just in time.

06:21.680 --> 06:25.280
Fez was telling me about, uh, some kind
of problem you're having with Rhonda.

06:25.360 --> 06:30.880
Yeah. Rhonda won't let me get past second
base, and I really want to explore further.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.680
Mmm. Gosh.
Well, I don't know...

06:36.760 --> 06:40.040
I think if you're patient,
and you're respectful...

06:40.080 --> 06:45.200
when Rhonda's ready,
she'll, uh... she'll wave you over.

06:45.280 --> 06:49.960
Well, thank you, Eric.
That is very gentlemanly advice.

06:52.440 --> 06:57.400
Gentlemanly?
Well, uh, guilty as charged, I guess.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.080
Hey, Casey, uh,
what do you think?

07:03.120 --> 07:07.320
Well, sometimes
a seasoned lady like Rhonda...

07:07.400 --> 07:10.400
she's gotten used to
the usual order of things.

07:10.440 --> 07:13.760
So, I think the next time
you're fooling around...

07:13.800 --> 07:17.600
just, uh, skip second
and go right to third.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.920
- What?
- It's genius!

07:21.000 --> 07:23.400
No wonder
you never get any.

07:26.760 --> 07:29.240
Yeah, with Rhonda, you know,
that just might work.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.360
W-Wait, you like that?

07:31.440 --> 07:35.280
Well, the words are wrong, but they
sound so good coming out of his mouth.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.040
I got a way about me.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.240
That worked out...
"thuper."

07:48.840 --> 07:53.040
Okay, Michael. I found something out
about our situation.

07:53.120 --> 07:56.960
This article says that cheating
is a symptom of a deeper problem.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.880
Deeper problem?

07:58.920 --> 08:02.960
No! I don't want a deeper problem!
I want a quick fix!

08:03.040 --> 08:05.080
Well, too bad.

08:05.160 --> 08:09.160
Because I realized that I'm still hurt and
angry from all the times you cheated on me.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.080
Okay? And that is why
I kissed that guy.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.160
So what are you saying?

08:13.240 --> 08:15.960
I'm sayin',
I'm not sorry.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.640
I'm not sorry!

08:23.120 --> 08:25.560
Come on!

08:28.120 --> 08:30.840
Look, now I know
why I cheated.

08:30.920 --> 08:34.440
You need to read this <i>Cosmo</i>
and find out why you did.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.799
I ripped out the boob pictures,
so don't bother looking.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.360
Hey, Donna, uh,
would you like a hot dog?

08:43.440 --> 08:45.400
Um, maybe half.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.120
Whoa, man,
you carry a knife?

08:52.200 --> 08:57.680
Yeah. You never know when a lady's
gonna need a half a hot dog.

08:59.280 --> 09:03.600
It's funny man. You're the Boy Scout,
but I'm the one who's prepared.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.880
He's like a gladiator.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.280
Okay, that's it. I'm bringing out
the big guns. Oh, yeah.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.240
I'm introducing him
to my folks.

09:21.120 --> 09:24.760
Oh, hey, Mom, meet Casey.
This is Donna's new boyfriend.

09:29.640 --> 09:34.720
Well, you're certainly not a girl!

09:37.320 --> 09:39.360
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Forman.

09:39.440 --> 09:43.720
You know, you couldn't have picked a prettier
day to win a year's supply of hot dogs.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.960
Yeah, sure is a hot dog.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.360
Mom!

09:56.440 --> 10:00.640
Sorry, honey, it's just...
He's just...

10:02.760 --> 10:05.880
I am sure
you are much smarter.

10:09.400 --> 10:14.160
Kitty, the idiot neighbors
drank all my beer.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.120
Uh-oh. You're in a bad mood.
Hey, meet Casey.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.360
Pleasure, sir.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.560
Hey, maybe I can help.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.720
I always keep an spare case
of beer in the Trans Am.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.920
Little tip I picked up
in the army.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.720
I don't know.
Seems like a pretty good kid.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.640
Uh-huh.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.640
So, you and Casey, huh?

10:39.720 --> 10:42.240
Look, Hyde, whatever you heard
about Casey, he's changed now.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.640
He's... He's mature.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.120
Oh, yeah.
He's real mature.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.040
Well, I like him!

10:49.120 --> 10:51.800
We're together, and if you can't deal
with that, then you can just go to hell!

10:51.880 --> 10:55.160
Hey, that's not barbecue language,
young lady!

10:58.120 --> 11:01.600
Here's that beer, sir.
I got a soda for the minor.

11:05.080 --> 11:09.360
Now, you make sure
to drink that real slow...

11:09.440 --> 11:12.160
'cause I don't want you
to get a tummy ache, little guy.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.840
Well, that's thoughtful.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.080
Yeah, he cramps up easy.

11:32.700 --> 11:36.060
Casey and Donna, man.

11:36.140 --> 11:39.020
Hey, remember when we were 12?
We didn't even like girls yet.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.660
I liked girls
when I was 12.

11:44.700 --> 11:48.020
Yeah, I was happy to stay at home
Friday night in my underwear...

11:48.100 --> 11:50.540
just tossin'
a football to myself.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.700
Yeah, never did that either.

12:00.860 --> 12:05.780
Well, at least I gave it
my best shot, right?

12:05.820 --> 12:11.540
If Donna loves Casey and not me,
then, I mean, I guess it's over.

12:13.220 --> 12:17.020
Wha... Forman,
you can't give up.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.940
Okay, look. Who knows what's
gonna happen with me and Jackie.

12:20.020 --> 12:22.620
But what you
and Donna had?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.860
That was, like, real.

12:26.300 --> 12:30.100
And I'm telling you, as his brother...
Look, Casey is bad news.

12:30.140 --> 12:33.780
He's either gonna get bored and split,
or something worse is gonna happen.

12:33.860 --> 12:36.660
So, you gotta
do something.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.500
Hey, since when did
you get all serious?

12:44.220 --> 12:46.380
Been reading <i>Cosmo.</i>

12:52.220 --> 12:55.220
It's very educational.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.660
Yeah. I never realized how much
plumbing girls had down there.

13:00.660 --> 13:04.300
Like, there's this diagram,
and it's like a map of Six Flags.

13:07.460 --> 13:11.340
Okay, everyone.
Here's lunch.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.420
Hot dog soup!

13:15.700 --> 13:18.020
No more hot dogs!

13:18.100 --> 13:19.940
I'll just eat
the grilled cheese.

13:20.020 --> 13:22.820
You mean, grilled cheese
with hot dogs!

13:25.180 --> 13:27.580
Kitty, for God's sakes...

13:27.660 --> 13:31.500
I ate 14 hot dogs yesterday!

13:31.580 --> 13:33.980
Well, what do you want me to do, Red?
They're everywhere.

13:34.060 --> 13:36.300
They're a curse
on this house!

13:36.380 --> 13:39.220
Oh, fine.
Let's make some calls.

13:39.300 --> 13:42.420
Maybe we can unload
the damn things on a nursery school.

13:44.860 --> 13:48.020
You guys, I have let this thing
with Casey go way too far.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.580
Yeah, no kidding.
Donna's pretty far gone.

13:50.660 --> 13:53.140
She's starting to lash out
at people at barbecues.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.100
You gotta
kick his ass, man!

13:55.140 --> 13:58.260
Hyde, Eric cannot beat Casey
with his fists.

13:58.300 --> 14:01.900
He's a special boy who must beat him
with his special strengths.

14:03.900 --> 14:07.540
Now, let's think.
What is Eric's special strengths?

14:10.660 --> 14:13.300
Welcome back to TV's
favorite game show...

14:13.380 --> 14:16.100
<i>Get Into That Box!</i>

14:17.540 --> 14:21.340
Now let's meet our returning champion,
Eric Forman!

14:21.380 --> 14:23.580
Thanks.
Good to be back, Fez.

14:24.820 --> 14:29.220
Let's meet our challenger,
Casey Kelso!

14:31.380 --> 14:34.500
Casey Kelso,
it's time to...

14:34.580 --> 14:37.780
<i>Get Into That Box!</i>

14:45.500 --> 14:47.660
How does he do it?

14:48.940 --> 14:51.300
He's so tiny!

14:57.220 --> 14:59.100
I would watch that show.

15:00.980 --> 15:03.460
Okay.
That was great.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.660
Guys, I'm going
over to Casey's.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.580
And I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

15:08.660 --> 15:12.700
But if things get physical,
I'm just gonna have to drop the hammer.

15:14.340 --> 15:18.620
And if all else fails,
kick him in the stones and run like hell.

15:18.660 --> 15:20.660
Yeah, that's what I meant by
"drop the hammer."

15:30.420 --> 15:33.460
Rhonda, your lively tongue
has made me thirsty.

15:39.140 --> 15:41.020
Would you like to
wet your whistle?

15:58.300 --> 16:00.700
Wow, thirsty lady.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.980
Well, we're off to
a nice start.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.420
Shall we move on
to second base?

16:15.900 --> 16:18.380
Ay, no.

16:20.580 --> 16:24.660
Guess what. I read your little
"everything's my fault" article...

16:24.740 --> 16:27.420
and I realized
why I cheated.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.460
Remember the first time
I kissed Pam Macy?

16:29.540 --> 16:33.460
- Behind the gym?
- And <i>in</i> the gym, and in her car.

16:34.540 --> 16:36.660
But, anyway...

16:36.700 --> 16:41.140
Earlier that day, I didn't have
any money to buy you Tater Tots.

16:41.220 --> 16:45.380
You said that I'd never be able to
support you, 'cause I wasn't smart enough.

16:45.460 --> 16:51.180
You're always puttin' me down like that,
and it makes me feel bad about myself.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.700
And that is why I cheated.

16:54.900 --> 16:57.140
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard!

16:58.460 --> 17:00.380
Just like that.

17:00.460 --> 17:04.980
And then I thought about it,
and I realized that I'm not sorry either!

17:06.180 --> 17:09.060
Hey!

17:10.180 --> 17:12.099
Michael,
what are you saying?

17:12.180 --> 17:17.260
I'm sayin' that we're not right for
each other, because you make me feel bad!

17:20.260 --> 17:22.780
And...

17:22.859 --> 17:24.700
And...

17:24.780 --> 17:26.900
I don't think I can
be with you anymore.

17:28.980 --> 17:31.020
I want to break up.

17:32.820 --> 17:35.980
Wait, break up?

17:36.060 --> 17:38.700
No, no. Michael, I was wrong.
Please, let's talk about this.

17:38.780 --> 17:41.020
- No.
- Wait, but Michael!

17:47.780 --> 17:49.660
Casey, we need to talk.

17:49.700 --> 17:53.220
Well, I'm a little swamped
right now, Foreplay.

17:55.580 --> 17:59.100
I think Donna thinks
you love her...

17:59.180 --> 18:01.260
and if you don't,
you shouldn't act like you do.

18:01.340 --> 18:03.700
What are you?
The love police?

18:03.740 --> 18:06.180
Hands up!
Love police is here.

18:06.260 --> 18:10.260
Hey, all I'm saying is that
if you don't love her...

18:10.340 --> 18:12.300
just don't be with her, okay?

18:12.380 --> 18:14.820
Because she's
a really special person...

18:14.900 --> 18:17.660
and someone out there
could really love her.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.980
Someone out there
or someone right here?

18:23.260 --> 18:25.340
Oh, hey, Eric.
What are you doing here?

18:25.420 --> 18:27.260
He was just leaving.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.460
Oh. Well,
I gotta go too.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.420
Hey, Pinciotti.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.660
Love ya.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.580
Oh, well, I...

18:41.780 --> 18:44.340
Thank you.

18:44.380 --> 18:47.580
Okay, well I'll, uh,
I'll see you later.

18:51.060 --> 18:54.420
You see, Forman,
it's just words.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.380
You don't have to mean it.

19:00.660 --> 19:06.100
If you make her cry,
I'm coming right back here to kick your ass.

19:12.420 --> 19:16.780
Well, me and Jackie
are officially over.

19:16.860 --> 19:19.140
We're as done
as this hot dog.

19:20.980 --> 19:23.140
This hot dog isn't done!

19:26.140 --> 19:29.940
Well, if kicking Casey's butt is the same
as babbling at him from a safe distance...

19:30.020 --> 19:32.380
then, boy, did I do it!

19:32.420 --> 19:36.100
But seriously, you guys,
the days of Daffy are over.

19:36.180 --> 19:38.780
It's time for action.

19:38.860 --> 19:40.740
I'm goin' Road Runner
on his ass.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.700
Beep, beep!
Pow!

19:46.180 --> 19:48.060
Good.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.060
Because thanks to his stupid advice,
Rhonda dumped me.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.580
I tried to steal third,
but she blocked me...

19:53.660 --> 19:56.540
and choked me.

19:56.620 --> 19:59.540
Now there is
no more baseball for Fez.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.460
It's back to handball.

20:03.100 --> 20:06.420
Girls, man.
They'll make you miserable.

20:07.660 --> 20:09.540
Well, I got a date.

20:09.620 --> 20:11.620
"Tho" long, "thuckerth!"

20:12.460 --> 20:15.820
It's like <i>Playboy...</i>

20:15.900 --> 20:18.140
but girls look at it.

20:18.220 --> 20:21.020
I know.
How hot is that?

20:23.100 --> 20:25.220
Oh, look. Six Flags!

20:30.220 --> 20:32.060
Well, that better not be
a dirty magazine.

20:32.140 --> 20:35.700
Oh, <i>Cosmo.</i>
Good for you.

20:35.780 --> 20:37.820
<i>Cosmo?</i>

20:37.900 --> 20:41.100
You boys are spending
too much time together.
