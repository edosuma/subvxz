WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.309
Zed: Welcome back
to Seabrook,

00:03.351 --> 00:05.271
where belonging is everything.

00:07.224 --> 00:09.104
Addison:
We're a strong, united

00:09.139 --> 00:10.879
and tight-knit community.

00:12.403 --> 00:15.583
And that's a good thing 'cause
it wasn't always this way.

00:16.886 --> 00:19.146
There was a time when
we had to protect ourselves.

00:21.543 --> 00:24.593
Legend has it that when the
first settlers came to Seabrook,

00:24.633 --> 00:27.033
they found wild beasts
with sharp claws

00:27.070 --> 00:28.330
lurking in the forest.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.676
(snarling)

00:29.725 --> 00:31.765
Zed: Which sparked
an epic battle.

00:31.814 --> 00:35.174
Seabrook settlers bravely
fought off the monstrous attack.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.387
And discovered a powerful
energy source.

00:40.866 --> 00:43.516
Realizing they discovered
a precious resource,

00:43.565 --> 00:45.255
they safeguarded it
from the beasts.

00:47.308 --> 00:48.868
Addison: They weren't going to
let anyone steal their treasure.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.218
So they hid it.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.045
And the town prospered
and grew rich

00:53.096 --> 00:55.786
by harnessing the precious
energy source.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.538
Seabrook benefited greatly
as it grew strong,

00:58.580 --> 00:59.970
happy, and unified.

01:00.016 --> 01:01.796
Zed: The beasts were
a distant memory.

01:01.844 --> 01:03.984
Addison: Seabrook forgot
monsters could be real.

01:04.019 --> 01:05.890
Zed: Until clearly,
they were.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.885
A little lime soda mixed
with a dash

01:07.937 --> 01:09.977
of industrial strength
Seabrook energy...

01:10.026 --> 01:12.936
- And boom!
- (explosion)

01:12.985 --> 01:14.195
Zombies were created.

01:14.248 --> 01:16.548
(growling and snarling)

01:20.863 --> 01:23.523
In a lot of ways,
Seabrook's moved on since then.

01:24.693 --> 01:26.743
But it's hard to bury
your past.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.872
(growling)

01:31.917 --> 01:33.527
(terrified screaming)

01:33.571 --> 01:35.101
(growling)

01:37.532 --> 01:39.882
Kids:
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:39.925 --> 01:41.135
(playful growling)

01:41.188 --> 01:43.098
Hey, I'm Zed.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.146
And yup, still a zombie.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.372
(grunts)

01:46.410 --> 01:48.280
For zombies in Seabrook,
things are changing.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.275
Every day is better
than the last.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.852
Seabrook is getting rid of all
of its old anti-monster laws,

01:54.897 --> 01:57.157
so now Zombietown is open
to everyone.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.424
Come on!

01:58.466 --> 02:00.816
Wait, wait, wait!
No, Zoey, wait for me!

02:00.859 --> 02:02.029
Wait. Watch out!

02:03.210 --> 02:05.130
And business is booming.

02:05.864 --> 02:06.914
Hey, hey!

02:06.952 --> 02:08.262
What's up, coach?

02:08.301 --> 02:11.352
Oh, football off-season
has been good to me, Zed.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.092
Invested in a Fro-Yo cart.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.873
Little side hustle,
gonna go global,

02:15.918 --> 02:18.048
gonna buy a car,
get some dress shirts,

02:18.094 --> 02:20.184
go on vacation
without my great aunt Edna.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.877
Though she loves
swimwear weather.

02:21.924 --> 02:23.364
You know I might just
bring her along.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.844
Cauliflower brains
mocha crunch, please.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.024
You got it!

02:28.496 --> 02:29.926
Seabrook has way more flavors
than just vanilla now.

02:29.975 --> 02:31.455
I'll take a vanilla, coach.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.109
What? I like vanilla.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.373
In a couple days,

02:34.415 --> 02:36.025
we're even tearing down
old Seabrook power

02:36.068 --> 02:37.718
to build a new cheer pavilion.

02:37.766 --> 02:40.156
And not to take too much credit
for all the positive changes,

02:40.203 --> 02:41.513
but yeah, I did good.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.082
It's hard to believe
there was a time

02:43.119 --> 02:44.729
when people were afraid
of zombies.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.167
Okay, let's triple check that.

02:52.650 --> 02:53.520
Hey, Dad.

02:53.564 --> 02:54.614
Hey, son.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.742
First day as foreman
of the demo crew.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.995
- Big day for zombie-kind.
- Yeah, you'll do great.

02:59.048 --> 03:01.008
Just don't make any lame
zombie dad jokes.

03:01.050 --> 03:02.970
But the workin' stiffs love 'em.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.008
(laughs)

03:05.141 --> 03:09.751
(cheering)

03:12.801 --> 03:14.851
Boy: Go, Shrimpy! Go Shrimpy!

03:14.890 --> 03:16.370
Cheer Camp!

03:16.413 --> 03:18.333
Even more sparkly
than I dreamed.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.462
(laughs)

03:19.503 --> 03:22.113
Hi, I'm Addison, and this
is cheer camp,

03:22.158 --> 03:23.938
a place where everyone belongs.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.066
We're a unified squad and...

03:25.117 --> 03:26.677
Bucky: Split up.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.948
Usually unified.
(chuckles)

03:29.731 --> 03:31.431
(whistle blows)

03:31.472 --> 03:33.742
♪♪

03:33.778 --> 03:35.908
- Woo!
- All: Yay, Bucky!

03:35.954 --> 03:38.874
That's cheer captain Bucky,
my cousin.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.444
(applause)

03:41.090 --> 03:44.180
You've all heard the stories
of bloodthirsty monsters

03:44.224 --> 03:45.794
- who roam these woods,
- (Shrimpy whimpering)

03:45.834 --> 03:48.054
feasting on innocent
cheerleaders.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.357
- Boo!
- (screams)

03:50.055 --> 03:52.535
(Bucky laughs)

03:52.580 --> 03:54.890
Well, those stories are just
silly make believe.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.020
But you'd better believe
we're gonna break you down

03:57.062 --> 04:01.072
and build you back up into peppy
little cheer machines like...

04:01.110 --> 04:03.810
- Lacey!
- (applause)

04:04.853 --> 04:06.993
- Stacey!
- (applause)

04:08.030 --> 04:09.990
And our most recent Acey,
JC.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.119
(applause)

04:15.080 --> 04:16.339
I'm Kevin.

04:17.909 --> 04:18.999
...Right.

04:20.346 --> 04:23.127
We changed my name to JC,
which I love by the way.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.526
Long live the Aceys!

04:27.571 --> 04:28.791
(applause)

04:29.269 --> 04:31.919
You three lead the veterans,
you're the A-team.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.837
Addison, Bree, you take
the newbies.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.193
You're the, uh, you're
the Z-team.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.237
(yelling)
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!

04:41.281 --> 04:43.331
This demolition
has got to go!

04:43.370 --> 04:44.850
They can't tear it down, Zed.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.553
Seabrook power hasn't worked
for years.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.330
It's an important part of
zombie heritage.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.065
This is progress, Eliza.

04:50.115 --> 04:51.985
And now we can even
go to Prawn.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.300
Prawn is like super-sized prom,
but Mighty Shrimp themed.

04:56.339 --> 04:58.429
And, this is the first year
zombies can attend.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.952
And it's gonna be epic.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.556
I'm loud and proud to be
a zombie.

05:03.607 --> 05:04.957
Sometimes too loud.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.700
Soon, Z-band tech will get
so good

05:07.742 --> 05:09.352
that zombies will blend
right in.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.006
I dream of a day we ditch
our Z-bands

05:11.049 --> 05:12.529
and let our
inner monsters roar.

05:12.573 --> 05:14.233
(roars)

05:15.402 --> 05:18.192
Zombies, this is obviously
your first cheer camp.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.620
Now, I'm not anti-change,

05:19.667 --> 05:21.927
I'm just pro keeping things
the way they are,

05:21.973 --> 05:24.803
because you don't mess
with success.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.276
(laughs)

05:26.326 --> 05:28.196
This week, the veterans
and the newbies will compete

05:28.240 --> 05:29.890
for the Cheer Camp Cup

05:29.938 --> 05:31.978
to see who is more
cheertastic!

05:32.027 --> 05:34.377
The veterans have always
won the Cheer Camp Cup,

05:34.421 --> 05:35.421
right Aceys?

05:35.465 --> 05:36.675
All: Right!

05:36.727 --> 05:37.947
We'll see about that.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.899
To the cheer course!

05:40.514 --> 05:42.174
Watch and learn, snowball.

05:42.211 --> 05:43.781
Ah yes, my hair.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.741
Still white,
still well-conditioned,

05:45.780 --> 05:48.130
and still drawing fire
from the Aceys.

05:48.173 --> 05:50.353
Bucky: Addison,
get those pom-poms pumping.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.353
Let's show 'em that we got this.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.825
All: Yeah!

05:53.875 --> 05:55.915

Aceys, disappointing.

You can't be scared to get those
jazz hands dirty.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.941
- Uh... Wha...

10:36.984 --> 10:38.464
The Cheer Camp Cup is yours.

10:40.552 --> 10:41.862
- Whoa.
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.952
Now let's make this victory
about me.

10:43.991 --> 10:47.041
I've decided to be school
president this year.

10:47.081 --> 10:48.821
Now technically,
there's an election,

10:48.865 --> 10:50.605
but come on.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.870
Which means we'll need
a new cheer captain

10:53.914 --> 10:56.184
while I rule the school.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.350
Who's worthy to lead?

10:57.395 --> 10:58.695
(all clamoring)

10:58.745 --> 10:59.955
What do you mean?
It's me!

11:00.007 --> 11:01.437
Kevin: Me, me, me,
me, me, me, me, me!

11:01.486 --> 11:03.486
No! No, no, no, no.

11:03.532 --> 11:06.842
We... we need a captain that's
going to build a united squad.

11:06.883 --> 11:09.063
Someone like Addison.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.933
Thanks, Bree.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.804
Being cheer captain has always
been my dream.

11:13.629 --> 11:15.809
(chanting):
Addison! Addison!

11:15.849 --> 11:19.639
- Z-Team: Addison! Addison! Addison!

11:27.425 --> 11:30.205
Cheer Camp's over and we're
finally headed home.

11:30.254 --> 11:35.004
I'm so excited to see,
well, you know.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.002
(laughs)

11:36.043 --> 11:38.223
Yes! I got invited to Prawn!

11:38.262 --> 11:40.702
(applause)

11:45.052 --> 11:48.062
Well, getting invited
to Prawn sounds great,

11:48.098 --> 11:50.448
but Bonzo won't even
look at me.

12:01.416 --> 12:04.416
No invitation to Prawn
for me, either.

12:04.462 --> 12:05.942
Do you think Zed forgot
about me?

12:05.986 --> 12:06.896
No.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.949
When do I throw the confetti?

Who's there?

14:22.078 --> 14:23.298
Hello?

There they are!

14:54.981 --> 14:56.111
Zoey.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.506
We're not alone.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.288
We're surrounded by...
werewolves.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.123
Cool!

15:00.943 --> 15:02.083
- What?
- Wolves?

15:02.118 --> 15:03.768
- What wolves?
- Here wolves?

15:03.815 --> 15:05.165
Aceys:
Were-wolves?

15:07.558 --> 15:08.858
Nobody's gonna believe this.

15:10.474 --> 15:11.824
Bucky:
Werewolves are real!

15:13.086 --> 15:16.826
I always, always said
the stories of monsters

15:16.872 --> 15:18.482
in the forest were real.

15:18.526 --> 15:19.876
And no one believed me.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.965
I thought werewolves
were just myths.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.229
Yeah, like cavities.

15:26.882 --> 15:27.932
Those are real too?

15:27.970 --> 15:29.320
Werewolves, ew.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.893
I really hope my allergies
don't act up.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.761
Please can I have one?

15:33.802 --> 15:35.502
I'm the only zombie
in my class.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.243
A werewolf friend
would be great.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.504
I'll feed him and walk him.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.897
Yeah, werewolves
ain't class pets, Zoey.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.071
And they certainly
ain't friendly.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.293
I'm okay.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.467
Aunt Missy, Uncle Dale.

15:49.513 --> 15:53.473
The crash was horrible,
but I protected Addison.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.817
Anyone as courageous as me
would've done the same.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.874
Though not really,
I am super brave.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.004
Mom, Dad,
everything is fine.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.087
It's not fine. There are
werewolves circling us right now,

16:03.136 --> 16:04.306
waiting to attack.

16:04.354 --> 16:06.144
Yeah, and I'm way too tasty.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.362
I'm always looking like
a snack.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.445
Somebody has to do something.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.151
And someone will.

16:12.188 --> 16:13.798
Hold my purse.

16:15.452 --> 16:16.982
(gavel slams)

16:18.107 --> 16:20.147
By order of city council,
effective immediately,

16:20.196 --> 16:23.026
all anti-monster laws
are reinstated.

16:23.069 --> 16:23.939

16:23.983 --> 16:26.683

16:27.682 --> 16:28.992
Mom, that is unfair!

16:33.035 --> 16:34.425
- Zed, we need to talk.
- We do.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.078
Even though you didn't write,
or answer any of my letters.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.076
No, I wrote.

16:38.127 --> 16:39.647
A lot.

16:40.825 --> 16:43.995
(sighs) The Aceys shredded
all of our letters.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.224
(chuckles)

16:52.402 --> 16:53.622
Addison.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.844
Will you make me
the luckiest zombie

16:56.363 --> 16:58.023
and be my date to Prawn?

16:58.669 --> 17:00.279
- No.
- Great! No?

17:00.323 --> 17:01.933
Everyone's freaking out
about werewolves,

17:01.977 --> 17:04.367
so the anti-monster laws are
in affect again, which means...

17:04.414 --> 17:05.854
Zombies can't go to Prawn.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.034
Ouch.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.455
But we're going to fight this,
Zed.

17:09.506 --> 17:10.935
Okay, so that's why
you said no?

17:10.986 --> 17:11.766
Yeah.

17:13.554 --> 17:14.864
Why are you smiling?

17:14.903 --> 17:16.383
Because when you said no,

17:16.425 --> 17:17.906
I thought you didn't
like me anymore.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.128
But the only problem here

17:19.167 --> 17:21.038
is a bunch of blood-thirsty
werewolves.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.653
We can so fix that.

Dreams of Fro-Yo success
melted away.

17:48.458 --> 17:49.628

17:49.677 --> 17:52.847
Look, I like zombies.
They like Fro-Yo.

17:52.897 --> 17:55.807

Maybe with sprinkles.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.767

Silly kid, there's no
such thing as werewolves.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.077
But we heard it howl.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.170
Maybe it was a hiker saying,
"howl's it going?"

18:43.470 --> 18:45.600
It was a werewolf.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.692
She's real,

20:17.738 --> 20:20.038

And you know we don't have
much time.

20:22.003 --> 20:24.053
More and more of our pack
are getting sick.

20:24.092 --> 20:26.702

out of power.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.657
We need to find the moonstone.

20:28.705 --> 20:31.395
And when we do, we can
recharge our necklaces

20:31.447 --> 20:35.447
and stay wolf strong
for another 100 years.

20:35.495 --> 20:38.925
Okay. Even if the girl
is the Great Alpha,

20:38.976 --> 20:39.846
how do we find her?

20:40.978 --> 20:43.288
I found this in the woods.
It's hers.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.939
(gasps) We'll track her down
with our keen sense of smell.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.380
Says Seabrook High on it,

20:48.421 --> 20:49.941
so I thought we might
just look there.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.337
Ugh!

20:51.380 --> 20:52.640
Okay, fine.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.816
We find the girl,
and if she's the Great Alpha,

20:54.862 --> 20:56.952
she'll tell us where
the moonstone is hidden.

20:56.994 --> 20:58.004
We go in the morning.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.429
We go tonight!

20:59.475 --> 21:00.775
Or tonight works.

get our moonstone and leave
this awful place.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.243
I wouldn't call it awful.

23:38.286 --> 23:40.286
They got something
called Fro-Yo.

23:41.898 --> 23:44.208
Yeah, you're right.
This town's the worst.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.264
Boy: Hey, I guess I
will see you after tryouts.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.820
Girl:
Yeah, sure, awesome.

23:54.258 --> 23:55.608
Boy:
Hey, man, how are you...

23:58.088 --> 24:00.608
I really thought we'd all be
at the Prawn together.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.656
- I thought Seabrook could change.
- It did.

24:02.702 --> 24:04.752
Believe me, I will find a way
to get us to the Prawn.

24:04.791 --> 24:05.971
Or we could miss it together.

24:06.270 --> 24:07.490
I'm not letting you miss
the Prawn.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.323
If you can't go,
I'm not going.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.230
Well, I like you too much
not to let you go.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.055
Well, I like you too much
to leave you behind.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.323
I am so not going.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.665
Ugh, you guys even fight
like a perfect couple.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.066
How's it going, Eliza?

24:18.108 --> 24:19.888
You know, fighting injustice
is keeping me busy.

24:19.936 --> 24:21.806
And looking good doing it,
Zom-bae.

24:21.851 --> 24:22.851
(laughs)

24:22.896 --> 24:24.806
I'm thinking the student
president

24:24.854 --> 24:26.124
should get his own
corner office.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.510
Let's see if we can move out
the math department.

24:27.553 --> 24:28.863
- Write that down.
- Done.

24:28.902 --> 24:30.162
Addison!

24:30.207 --> 24:32.247
Time to officially nominate me
as president.

24:32.296 --> 24:35.996
Let's keep it understated,
yet extravagant and flashy.

24:36.039 --> 24:36.949
Ooh, yeah.

24:36.997 --> 24:37.997
Bucky:
Make sure...

24:38.041 --> 24:38.871
Cheer could be so much
more than

24:38.912 --> 24:40.742
just pom-pomming for Bucky.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.613
Lacey:
Uh, Addison?

24:43.264 --> 24:46.404
Once we're cheer captain,
you are so off the team.

24:46.441 --> 24:49.401
And when I'm cheer captain,
you'll be welcome to stay,

24:49.444 --> 24:51.974
because I'll be making cheer
about bringing people together.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.802
(laughs)
That was awful trash talk.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.150
I know, right?

24:55.189 --> 24:57.539
You will never be
cheer captain, freak.

24:57.583 --> 24:58.583
Stacey:
See ya.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.716
I gotta find a way to get us
to the Prawn.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.152
We can crash it.

25:04.198 --> 25:05.808
I mean, we can't make the rules,
but we can break 'em.

25:05.852 --> 25:06.812
(snaps fingers)

25:06.853 --> 25:08.253
Well, we can make the rules!

25:08.289 --> 25:10.069
We just need the right leader.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.990
- (cheering)
- Okay, are there any more nominees for president?

25:15.035 --> 25:17.595
Just a reminder that being part
of student council

25:17.646 --> 25:19.426
means that we get to hang.

25:19.866 --> 25:22.036
Anybody, anybody want
to hang?

25:22.085 --> 25:25.175
Just... anyone want
to hang out?

25:25.698 --> 25:27.348
Anyone?

25:27.395 --> 25:30.785
Oh, we could come up with our
very own complicated high five.

25:30.833 --> 25:31.883
That'd be fun, huh?

25:31.921 --> 25:33.231
Like...

25:33.880 --> 25:34.920
Oooh...

25:34.968 --> 25:37.008
(band plays fanfare)

25:37.057 --> 25:41.367
Students: (chanting)
Go! Go! Go!

25:41.409 --> 25:43.019
(cheering)

25:43.411 --> 25:45.201
Hi!

25:45.239 --> 25:46.589
(cheering)

25:49.896 --> 25:52.376
(cheering and applause)

25:52.942 --> 25:54.202
Good job!

25:54.248 --> 25:55.678
Okay.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.428
(cheering)

25:58.557 --> 26:02.557
Great news, we have a brilliant
and cheer tested candidate

26:02.604 --> 26:04.134
running for president
this year.

26:04.171 --> 26:05.131
Me!

26:05.476 --> 26:06.956
(cheering)

26:07.000 --> 26:08.700
(chanting)
Bucky! Bucky! Bucky!

26:08.741 --> 26:12.311
Students: Bucky!
Bucky! Bucky! Bucky!

26:12.353 --> 26:14.703
I'm running against Bucky
for president,

26:14.747 --> 26:16.707
but I need to one-up
his entrance.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.879
The question is, how?

26:18.925 --> 26:21.445
(chanting continues)

26:27.194 --> 26:28.544
(grunts)

26:28.761 --> 26:31.591
(grunting)

26:31.633 --> 26:34.033
- Bucky! Bucky! Bucky!
- (chanting stops)

26:34.070 --> 26:35.250
Woo!

26:35.289 --> 26:36.509
Excuse me.

26:36.551 --> 26:37.811
(laughs)

26:37.857 --> 26:39.247
Zombie strong!

26:39.293 --> 26:40.253
(cheering)

26:40.294 --> 26:41.564
Zed:
Hello, everyone.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.820
My name is Zed, and I am running
for president.

26:45.168 --> 26:46.648
(cheering and laughing)

26:47.388 --> 26:48.868
Zed can't steal my spotlight.

26:48.911 --> 26:50.831
What about the whole
anti-monster thingy?

26:50.870 --> 26:51.960
Shh...

26:52.001 --> 26:54.051
Anyone can run
for president, Bucky.

26:54.090 --> 26:56.010
She actually has a point,
Mr. Bucky.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.919
- (furiously) What?!
- Yes.

26:57.964 --> 26:59.314
A zombie president?

26:59.356 --> 27:00.916
Aceys: Ew!

27:00.967 --> 27:02.657
(cheering)

27:02.708 --> 27:04.318
As the first ever
zombie president,

27:04.361 --> 27:06.451
I will allow zombies to go
to the Prawn,

27:06.494 --> 27:08.064
I will take Addison
as my date,

27:08.104 --> 27:11.854
and we will get our photo
on the Prawn wall of fame.

27:11.891 --> 27:14.421
Maybe they'll rename the school
after me one day.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.108
Zed Necrodopolous High.

27:16.983 --> 27:18.903
Preferably before I graduate.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.031
Okay.

27:21.683 --> 27:25.693
If you vote for me, I will bring
you prosperity and awesomeness!

27:25.731 --> 27:27.781
(cheering wildly)

27:27.820 --> 27:30.820
Crowd: (chanting) Zed! Zed!
Zed! Zed! Zed! Zed! Zed! Zed!

27:34.914 --> 27:36.964
- The Great Alpha's near.
- Focus.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.873
Remember, we're fierce,
we're savage.

27:38.918 --> 27:40.008
We're werewolves!

27:40.049 --> 27:41.089
That's right, Wynter.

27:41.137 --> 27:42.697
We're scared of nothing.

27:42.748 --> 27:43.658
Except silver.

27:43.705 --> 27:44.785
Yeah, silver.

27:44.837 --> 27:45.707
And ticks.

27:45.751 --> 27:47.101
And rabies.

27:47.143 --> 27:48.713
Come on, if we're quiet,
we can be in and out of here

27:48.754 --> 27:49.974
before they even know
we're here.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.016
(yelps)

27:52.671 --> 27:53.931
(yelps)

27:53.976 --> 27:55.366
Ah, silver! Oh, pain!

27:55.412 --> 27:57.852
- I can take it.
- (sizzling)

27:57.893 --> 27:59.983
No, I can't!

28:00.026 --> 28:01.026
Nice grab.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.380
Come on.

28:07.381 --> 28:08.901
Zed:
As your president,

28:08.948 --> 28:12.428
I will make Seabrook a place
that embraces zombies and...

28:12.473 --> 28:13.393
(fearfully)
Werewolves?

28:13.430 --> 28:15.430
Uh, no. Why would we want...

28:15.476 --> 28:16.736
(screams)
Werewolves!

28:16.782 --> 28:18.832
(screaming)

28:21.874 --> 28:22.704
There she is!

28:23.658 --> 28:25.568
Football team!
Defense, Z 24.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.616
- Boy 1: Right!
- Boy 2: Let's go Mighty Shrimp!

28:28.707 --> 28:30.137
Where's the moonstone,
white hair?

28:30.186 --> 28:31.876
I think you've got
the wrong person.

28:31.927 --> 28:33.927
Uh, Eliza?
What are you doing?

28:33.973 --> 28:35.453
Let's smash our Z-bands
and zombie out.

28:35.496 --> 28:36.626
We can use our strength
to fend them off.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.331
We can't lose control.
We are not monsters.

28:38.673 --> 28:42.243
Our razor sharp claws will gut
'em and splatter their blood.

28:42.285 --> 28:43.895
(screaming)

28:45.462 --> 28:46.332
Too much?

28:47.943 --> 28:50.083
Wolves! On my command!

28:50.119 --> 28:52.029
(snarling)

28:52.948 --> 28:53.988
Willa.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.596
We can't go to war
with the whole town.

28:55.646 --> 28:58.126
We'll never find the moonstone
if they're on high alert.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.735
I hate it when you're right.

29:00.782 --> 29:02.832
Wolves, stand down.

29:06.092 --> 29:06.882
Okay.

29:08.877 --> 29:09.837
Sorry.

29:09.878 --> 29:12.528
We werewolves so admire
your town,

29:12.576 --> 29:16.016
and we just came here
to join your school.

29:16.493 --> 29:17.543
(murmurs of confusion)

29:17.581 --> 29:19.631
What? They can't join
our school.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.322
Technically the
Forbidden Forest

29:21.368 --> 29:23.368
is within the school district.

29:23.413 --> 29:24.723
So, welcome to Seabrook!

29:26.112 --> 29:27.332
(awkward laugh)

29:32.988 --> 29:34.338
Zed:
Zed for prez!

29:34.381 --> 29:37.511
Vote Zed for prez,
because I'm a zombie,

29:37.558 --> 29:39.728
not a zom-can't-be.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.208
Okay, here's our platform.

29:41.257 --> 29:43.517
We fight for zombie toppings
on pizza in the cafeteria.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.784
- Right.
- Get Zombie tongue taught
as a second language.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.697
- Good.
- And how to overthrow your oppressors after school club.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.923
- Eliza.
- Sorry, right. Don't over promise.

29:50.963 --> 29:53.573
But more importantly,
we allow zombies at Prawn.

29:53.617 --> 29:56.057
Good luck, Mr. Future President.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.968
Hey Zed, did you hear?

29:58.013 --> 29:59.323
Addie's being tested
for captain,

29:59.362 --> 30:00.972
and she gets to run
cheer practice tomorrow.

30:01.016 --> 30:02.366
It's not a big deal.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.759
Okay, it's huge.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.023
A huge chance to fail!

30:09.416 --> 30:12.066
If Addie aces this practice,
oh my gosh,

30:12.114 --> 30:14.464
she's so going to be cheer
captain once Bucky wins.

30:14.508 --> 30:16.418
He's so gonna win,
because you know, elections,

30:16.466 --> 30:18.686
they're just like these
big old popularity contests.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.559
And Bucky is super popular.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.691
- (clears throat)
- So... what?

30:22.733 --> 30:23.823
Thanks, Bree.

30:26.346 --> 30:28.216
I know it's weird
I'll only be cheer captain

30:28.261 --> 30:29.651
if Bucky's president, but...

30:29.697 --> 30:31.347
No, that just means
neither of us can lose,

30:31.394 --> 30:32.834
because one of us is going
to get what we want.

30:33.135 --> 30:34.475
And I can live with that.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.143
Me too.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.890
Wolves are key to winning
this election.

But you know winning over
the wolves is going to be hard.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.145

We're going to win the wolves
votes, and more.

attacked Seabrook settlers.

we were outsiders, too.

34:06.914 --> 34:09.134
Our moonstones make us
our true werewolf selves.

No, we'd die.

39:56.089 --> 39:57.399
They're into cheer.

39:57.438 --> 39:59.788
No, they're into you,
and you're into him... them.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.012
What?

40:02.443 --> 40:04.103
Why are you acting like this?

40:04.140 --> 40:05.750
Do you know how hard it was
for zombies?

40:05.794 --> 40:07.844
Now everything is just being
handed to the werewolves

40:07.883 --> 40:09.673
- on a silver platter.
- Actually, they hate silver.

40:09.711 --> 40:12.451
I'm trying to win an election
for my people, for you.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.367
So we can go to Prawn,
so we can be accepted.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.243
That's not being accepted.

40:18.067 --> 40:20.107
That's being afraid to show
who you really are.

40:20.156 --> 40:21.896
Says the girl who wore a wig
her whole life.

40:25.945 --> 40:28.025
Yeah. I did.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.725
Because I always felt
like an outsider.

40:31.907 --> 40:34.997
And even though I might be
cheer captain, I still do.

40:35.389 --> 40:37.959
You know I don't have
a place here!

40:38.566 --> 40:40.306
Don't have a zombie crew.

40:40.350 --> 40:42.270
I don't know what I am!

40:42.309 --> 40:44.919
So excuse me for respecting
a pack of werewolves

40:44.964 --> 40:46.234
who are proud of
who they are.

Come with us.

What's so important?

44:00.420 --> 44:01.810
You are.

Where are we going?

44:17.002 --> 44:18.222
It's a wolf secret.

If we told you,
we'd have to kill you.

44:22.311 --> 44:23.971
Too much, too much,
I knew it.

44:24.009 --> 44:25.099
Sorry.

44:25.140 --> 44:25.880
Welcome!

44:28.448 --> 44:30.018
But not too welcome!

44:30.929 --> 44:31.969
(hisses)

44:32.017 --> 44:33.977
(coughs)

44:34.019 --> 44:35.149
Are you okay?

44:36.499 --> 44:38.679
My necklace is losing
its charge.

44:39.764 --> 44:41.944
Every day, more and more
of our pack becomes sick

44:41.983 --> 44:44.553
because their moonstones
lose their power.

44:44.594 --> 44:47.034
All of our elders are too sick
to travel, which leaves...

44:47.075 --> 44:49.465
...which leaves taking care of
the pack to us.

44:49.512 --> 44:50.992
To me.

44:53.516 --> 44:56.296
You'll be fine, Wynter.
I promise.

44:57.782 --> 44:59.652
You'd better be right
about this.

45:00.654 --> 45:02.924
We need to find
the moonstone soon.

45:05.006 --> 45:05.876
Follow us, Addison.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.620
Please.

45:18.977 --> 45:20.277
You guys!

45:20.326 --> 45:22.976
I have to go apologize
to Addison right now.

45:23.024 --> 45:25.114
- Gruzah!
- Yeah I know, I want to see it too.

45:25.157 --> 45:26.377
You know, ever since
football ended,

45:26.419 --> 45:27.939
I've so missed watching you
get pummeled.

45:27.986 --> 45:29.806
Announcer:
Attention citizens.

45:29.857 --> 45:32.857
All curfews will be
strictly enforced.

45:32.904 --> 45:33.914
(speaks Zombie)

45:33.948 --> 45:35.518
Yeah, with the curfew
in effect,

45:35.558 --> 45:38.298
it's gonna be nearly impossible
to get past the Z-patrol.

45:38.344 --> 45:39.874
Hey guys!

45:39.911 --> 45:41.041
And yet somehow
Bree just did.

45:41.086 --> 45:43.176
Have you, have you guys
seen Addison?

45:43.218 --> 45:45.608
She texted me for help,
but she's not home,

45:45.655 --> 45:47.175
and she's not answering
her phone.

45:48.049 --> 45:49.269
...Oh.

45:49.311 --> 45:50.841
Hey, Bonzo.

45:50.878 --> 45:52.178
(speaks Zombie)

45:52.227 --> 45:53.097
(laughs)

45:53.141 --> 45:54.711
You guys, focus!

45:54.752 --> 45:55.542
Oh.

45:56.275 --> 45:57.535
Addison needs help.

45:57.580 --> 45:59.890
Okay, if her phone is on,
I can track her.

45:59.931 --> 46:00.981
(beeping)

46:07.025 --> 46:09.065
She's in the Forbidden Forest.

46:09.114 --> 46:10.994
The wolves.
They kidnapped her.

46:11.029 --> 46:12.199
You guys, we have
to help Addison.

46:18.036 --> 46:20.036
The wolf den!

46:20.778 --> 46:21.998
Addison: Wow.

46:23.650 --> 46:25.300
It's okay to be impressed.

46:25.347 --> 46:26.567
Wyatt:
Our language.

46:26.609 --> 46:28.349
(howls)
Addison!

46:28.394 --> 46:30.484
- That means welcome.
- (howls)

46:30.526 --> 46:32.176
(laughing)

46:32.224 --> 46:33.574
Ostrich boots?

46:33.616 --> 46:34.746
No, I think Addison meant

46:34.792 --> 46:36.142
(howls)

46:36.184 --> 46:37.494
(howls)

46:37.533 --> 46:39.413
- (laughing)
- Polka dot unicorn?

46:39.448 --> 46:40.358
Cool, where?

46:40.406 --> 46:42.836
Oh, no. Sorry, um.
Uh...

46:42.887 --> 46:43.977
(howls briefly)

46:44.018 --> 46:46.328
Whoa, whoa, language.

46:46.368 --> 46:47.628
There are were-pups around.

46:47.674 --> 46:50.814
She needs to put a pebble
in the swear-wolf jar.

46:50.851 --> 46:54.031
(wolves howling)

46:56.030 --> 46:57.770
I am so sorry.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.205
Enough.

46:59.251 --> 47:01.041
This is not why we brought
her here.

47:01.906 --> 47:03.556
Why am I here?

47:12.960 --> 47:15.050
(howling)

47:16.921 --> 47:19.791
I believe you will lead us
to the moonstone.

47:21.012 --> 47:23.622

the Great Alpha.

47:23.666 --> 47:25.316

I needed help on
the chemistry homework.

50:46.652 --> 50:48.482
Didn't you see
the beaker emoji?

50:51.178 --> 50:53.008
Oh... I do now.

50:53.050 --> 50:54.050
(laughs awkwardly)

50:54.094 --> 50:56.364
By the way, I love
this new look.

50:56.401 --> 50:57.661
New hairstylist?

50:57.706 --> 50:59.576
Werewolves, they know hair.

50:59.621 --> 51:01.061
And manicures.

51:01.101 --> 51:02.671
All: Mmm-hmm.

51:02.711 --> 51:04.321
They think I may be
a werewolf too.

51:04.365 --> 51:06.055
What? How?

51:06.106 --> 51:07.326
Maybe a grandparent.

51:07.368 --> 51:10.198
My hair means something.
This could be my pack.

51:10.241 --> 51:14.551
For centuries, this has been
set aside for the Great Alpha.

51:15.898 --> 51:18.678
A fully charged moonstone
is priceless to us, Addison.

51:18.727 --> 51:21.597
If you're truly one of us,
when you put it on,

51:21.643 --> 51:23.253
you'll be transformed
into a werewolf.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.611
Part of our pack, forever.

51:27.127 --> 51:28.777
What? No!

51:28.824 --> 51:29.704
Wait.

51:30.826 --> 51:32.176
Can I think about it?

51:36.136 --> 51:37.656
For a day.

51:39.008 --> 51:41.618
Once you've joined us, you can
lead us to the hidden moonstone.

51:41.663 --> 51:43.103
But she doesn't know
where it is.

51:44.057 --> 51:45.007
Zed:
What?

51:45.058 --> 51:47.888
(rumbling)

51:55.895 --> 51:57.845
(speaks Zombie)

51:58.332 --> 52:00.332
Yeah. The explosion came
from Seabrook Power.

52:00.378 --> 52:02.948
They must be testing charges
for the demolition tomorrow.

52:02.989 --> 52:04.989
Seabrook Power is the birthplace
of zombies.

52:05.034 --> 52:06.344
Zed:
A little lime soda mixed

52:06.384 --> 52:09.004
with some mysterious energy,
and bang!

52:09.038 --> 52:09.818
Zombies.

52:09.865 --> 52:11.295
(snarls)

52:11.867 --> 52:14.737
Nice story, but it doesn't
concern us.

52:14.783 --> 52:16.793
But it does concern you,
Willa.

52:16.829 --> 52:20.309
Seabrook Power was fueled
by a mysterious energy source.

52:21.616 --> 52:23.576
That could be your moonstone,
right?

52:23.618 --> 52:25.838
She found the moonstone.

52:25.881 --> 52:26.881
She's amazing.

52:30.582 --> 52:31.672
Wyatt:
If she's right...

52:32.061 --> 52:33.281
Wow.

52:37.545 --> 52:39.195
We'll see you at school
tomorrow, Addison.

52:39.243 --> 52:40.943
Okay. Tomorrow.

52:40.983 --> 52:42.513
Big day.

52:48.817 --> 52:50.037
If they destroy that building,

52:50.079 --> 52:51.779
it'll crush the moonstone
underneath.

52:51.820 --> 52:53.130
We can't let that happen.

52:53.170 --> 52:55.480
- Addison can help.
- Maybe once she's one of us.

52:55.520 --> 52:57.440
But until then,
I lead this pack.

52:59.567 --> 53:01.997
We need to stop them from
destroying the moonstone.

53:02.048 --> 53:03.218
Whatever it takes.

53:03.267 --> 53:04.657
(howls)

53:04.703 --> 53:07.233
(howling)

53:12.711 --> 53:15.101
♪♪

53:24.113 --> 53:25.943
So.

53:25.985 --> 53:27.245
New look?

53:27.291 --> 53:28.161
I like it.

53:28.205 --> 53:29.765
My new friends like it.

53:30.294 --> 53:34.994
Did you join a, um,
rock band?

53:37.736 --> 53:39.906
Announcer: It's
election day, Seabrook!

53:39.955 --> 53:43.045
We have an assembly to hear from
our presidential candidates,

53:43.089 --> 53:46.269
and it is going to be so good
to see you all.

53:47.833 --> 53:49.663
- Girl: Addison?
- Boy: Check her out!

53:49.704 --> 53:52.014
- Girl: She looks amazing!
- Boy: Look what she's wearing!

53:53.099 --> 53:54.619
Boy 2:
That is a fresh look!

53:54.666 --> 53:56.356
Whoa! Bad hair day?

53:56.407 --> 53:57.887
Bad hair life?

53:57.930 --> 53:59.710
I think it looks great.

53:59.758 --> 54:01.148
- Yeah, not so much.
- (snaps fingers)

54:01.194 --> 54:03.334
Addison, if you ever expect
to be cheer captain...

54:03.370 --> 54:05.070
Well, maybe I don't.

54:05.111 --> 54:06.981
Maybe cheer team
isn't for me after all.

54:07.026 --> 54:07.896
(Aceys gasps)

54:10.856 --> 54:12.336
Addison!

54:12.379 --> 54:13.989
I was up all night thinking.

54:14.033 --> 54:15.603
You're not a werewolf,
you can't be.

54:15.643 --> 54:17.303
But I love moonlight strolls.

54:17.341 --> 54:18.521
Yeah, you like sunsets too.

54:18.559 --> 54:19.559
That doesn't mean you're
a vampire.

54:19.604 --> 54:21.134
- Zed...
- Look.

54:21.170 --> 54:23.910
It's really hard being
considered a monster.

54:23.956 --> 54:25.036
Trust me.

54:25.087 --> 54:27.827
All I've ever wanted
is to find my pack.

54:29.004 --> 54:30.884
And now I finally have.

54:36.185 --> 54:38.665
When I see the wolves,
I'm going to put this on.

54:39.624 --> 54:42.064
And I'm really sorry I can't
make the debate,

54:42.104 --> 54:44.024
but I need to find the wolves.

54:47.240 --> 54:48.890
Good luck.

54:54.203 --> 54:56.903
Whoops, almost forgot.
You'll do great, Zed.

55:00.035 --> 55:01.385
Are you ready for the debate?

55:01.428 --> 55:02.858
Come on, we're going
to be late.

55:06.955 --> 55:08.305
You're going to prove
to everyone

55:08.348 --> 55:09.088
that we're more than just...

55:09.131 --> 55:10.001
...Monsters.

55:13.005 --> 55:15.395
- Bucky made me look...
- ...Scary.

55:25.060 --> 55:27.450
Announcer:
Attention, attention.

55:27.498 --> 55:30.458
This is an active
demolition site.

55:30.501 --> 55:34.371
All personnel please
evacuate immediately.

55:34.418 --> 55:37.898
Demolition is scheduled
for 5:00 PM this evening.

55:39.031 --> 55:41.031
All right, we don't have
much time.

55:41.076 --> 55:43.166
This is how we sabotage
the demolition and stop them.

55:43.209 --> 55:46.299
It's my responsibility to make
sure we're all safe.

55:46.343 --> 55:47.953
We follow my lead.

55:47.996 --> 55:49.646
It's a good plan, Willa.

55:49.694 --> 55:51.134
Addison:
What plan?

55:51.870 --> 55:53.090
We're going after
the moonstone.

55:53.132 --> 55:54.052
Top secret.

55:54.089 --> 55:55.789
You can't tell anyone.

55:57.092 --> 55:59.092
Bad wolf, bad wolf!

55:59.399 --> 56:00.489
You're going after
the moonstone now?

56:00.705 --> 56:01.875
It won't survive
the detonation.

56:02.184 --> 56:03.274
Then let me join you.

56:03.316 --> 56:04.926
I'm ready to become
a wolf.

56:04.970 --> 56:06.540
If you really are one.

56:08.974 --> 56:10.064
(gasps)

56:10.105 --> 56:10.925
It's gone.

56:10.976 --> 56:12.106
You lost it?

56:13.413 --> 56:15.763
Do you know how precious
a moonstone necklace is?

56:15.807 --> 56:17.637
If she was serious
about being a wolf,

56:17.678 --> 56:19.638
if she was the Great Alpha,

56:19.680 --> 56:21.120
she wouldn't have been
so careless.

56:21.160 --> 56:22.680
No, I... I don't know how!
I...

56:22.727 --> 56:24.557
Stay out of our amazing hair.

56:33.607 --> 56:34.907
You got your speech?

56:39.396 --> 56:40.916
Addison's necklace?

56:42.573 --> 56:43.533
I took it.

56:43.574 --> 56:45.184
I can't let her become
a werewolf.

56:45.227 --> 56:46.747
I have to protect her.

56:46.794 --> 56:48.544
All of this,
running for president,

56:48.579 --> 56:49.539
it's all for her.

56:49.580 --> 56:50.580
No, Zed.

56:50.624 --> 56:52.234
This is bigger than that,
okay?

56:52.278 --> 56:55.018
This is for you, for me,
for all zombies everywhere.

56:55.063 --> 56:57.073
This is more important
than anything else.

56:57.805 --> 56:59.755
Look, we'll deal
with this later, okay?

56:59.807 --> 57:01.027
Just become president.

57:01.069 --> 57:02.849
That's what zombies need.

57:06.466 --> 57:08.026
(exhales)

57:09.034 --> 57:11.434
(cheering)

57:11.906 --> 57:14.426
Your first nominee for...

57:16.084 --> 57:17.264
Running for president,

57:17.303 --> 57:20.003
wearing the sequined
Mighty Shrimp uniform...

57:20.045 --> 57:21.565
Three time MVP,

57:21.612 --> 57:24.752
lean, mean, cheering machine...

57:24.789 --> 57:27.439
And captain of our hearts...

57:27.487 --> 57:29.047
All: Bucky!

57:29.446 --> 57:30.746
(loud cheering)

57:30.795 --> 57:33.615
(dance music fanfare)

57:38.455 --> 57:39.925
Your other candidate of...

57:39.978 --> 57:41.458
Why not?

57:41.501 --> 57:44.591
Introducing our soon-to-be
first green-haired president

57:44.635 --> 57:47.455
and repping a proud people,
Zed!

57:47.507 --> 57:50.157
(loud cheering)

57:53.121 --> 57:54.121
Hear him roar!

57:54.166 --> 57:55.246
(growls)

57:55.297 --> 57:57.167
Um no, actually, we're not
going to roar.

57:57.212 --> 57:58.212
No roaring.

57:58.257 --> 57:59.387
Zed'll fight for you!

57:59.432 --> 58:01.132
You know what, um,
I'm not going to fight.

58:01.173 --> 58:02.913
'Cause, no, this isn't
a fight.

58:02.957 --> 58:06.957
This is just a nice lil' cordial
debate we're having here today.

58:07.005 --> 58:08.825
Good to hear, Zed.
(laughs)

58:08.876 --> 58:10.046
Oh, did you see that?

58:10.095 --> 58:11.485
That was a high-five.

58:11.531 --> 58:12.531
No.

58:12.576 --> 58:14.966
Are you ready to battle?

from me?

01:09:26.249 --> 01:09:29.118
Why would I ever go to the Prawn

Oh my gosh, boss, boss!
We got a problem!

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.340
- What?
- The remote shorted out,

01:10:14.384 --> 01:10:15.914

timer's running.
