Your dad.

00:18.462 --> 00:22.495
He'd stand there,
just staring at the ocean.

00:22.528 --> 00:25.795
I don't suppose there's
any way I can talk you
out of going down there?

You could try, but you'd
be wasting your time.

the wreckage of his sub,

wanted you to risk your life?

00:41.862 --> 00:43.862
...he knew he wasn't
coming back.

He gave it to me
before he left.

He told me that
one day I'd understand.

the Minotaur to death.

It saddens us all,

will destroy the city.

The people have done
nothing to deserve this.

question your father?

It is not I

to remember that.

There is no greater honour
than to give your life
for your city...

28:43.880 --> 28:45.546

29:32.253 --> 29:34.220

among the tributes?

29:36.220 --> 29:38.553
I saw you draw a white stone.

29:40.886 --> 29:45.486
My friend drew a black stone.
I am here in his place.

29:47.053 --> 29:48.986
I owe him my life.

29:50.286 --> 29:53.853
And now you will give
yours as a sacrifice?

29:53.886 --> 29:56.420
You are willing
to die to save him?

29:57.886 --> 30:01.986
The Oracle told me that this
is the path I must follow.

30:04.086 --> 30:06.993
I believe I'm meant
to kill the Minotaur.

30:09.593 --> 30:12.960

where so many have failed?

30:15.093 --> 30:17.360

in the labyrinth at Hawara.

I would tie one end of a skein
of thread to the entrance.

30:45.693 --> 30:47.593

30:47.626 --> 30:50.626
I would follow it until
I found my way back out.

by the witches of Colchis.

42:07.169 --> 42:08.803
...soon enough.

42:10.303 --> 42:12.836
And they will seek
to destroy him.

42:14.269 --> 42:18.669
For more than 20 years,
Atlantis has suffered
this curse.

42:18.703 --> 42:22.669
No more shall we be required
to send our citizens

42:22.703 --> 42:25.336
as an offering
to the Minotaur.

42:25.369 --> 42:29.736
This day, the gods
look favourably upon us.

42:29.769 --> 42:33.503
The City of Atlantis
owes you a great debt.

42:33.536 --> 42:35.336
Thank you, my Lord.

42:35.369 --> 42:38.069
The name's Hercules,
you may have heard of my...

42:38.103 --> 42:39.703
(APPLAUSE)

42:39.736 --> 42:40.836
...heroic...

42:40.869 --> 42:42.069
(APPLAUSE CONTINUES)

42:50.336 --> 42:53.164
It was of greater use
than you can possibly imagine.

43:04.330 --> 43:06.430
Who was that young man?

43:07.737 --> 43:10.070
He is of no consequence.

43:38.237 --> 43:41.970
-So, it seems our money
troubles are over.
-How so?

43:42.004 --> 43:46.004
People will pay handsomely
for the services of the men
who killed the Minotaur.

43:46.037 --> 43:48.404
We shall grow rich,
and live like hogs.

43:48.437 --> 43:52.070
Really? And how was it exactly
that you killed the Minotaur?

43:52.104 --> 43:53.537
I meant "We", together.

43:53.570 --> 43:56.337
You weren't even there.
You were too busy running
in the other direction.

43:56.370 --> 43:59.237
I was trying to draw
the Minotaur away from
the rest of the group.

43:59.270 --> 44:01.037
Oh, so you were just
pretending to be a coward?

44:01.070 --> 44:04.737
Now you've slain the Minotaur,
you think you're a big hero?

44:04.770 --> 44:06.737
So, you admit it was me
that killed the Minotaur?

44:06.770 --> 44:10.644
Say what you like. Whoever
heard of a hero called Jason?

44:10.677 --> 44:12.310
It's a ridiculous name.

44:12.344 --> 44:16.110
Now Hercules, that is
a name to father a legend.

44:16.144 --> 44:17.977
Oh, yes.
"The legend of Hercules.

44:18.010 --> 44:19.477
"The man who
fled the Minotaur."

44:19.510 --> 44:22.277
-You're an idiot, Pythagoras.
-At least he's not...

44:22.310 --> 44:24.177
I'm not fat! I'm big-boned.

44:31.377 --> 44:34.144
Why do I sense that you're not
telling me the whole truth?

44:35.677 --> 44:39.744
Because, above anything,
I must protect you

44:39.777 --> 44:41.710
from those who
would do you harm.

44:48.144 --> 44:49.210
MAN: (SHOUTING)
Jason!

44:53.244 --> 44:54.610
My name is Medusa.
