I mean why I fabricated

13:09.872 --> 13:12.584
evidence in the first place.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.587
I know why you did it.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.587
You can't stand to lose.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.213
Well, if you know that,

13:17.213 --> 13:19.716
and you're always saying

13:17.213 --> 13:19.716
how much alike we are,

13:19.716 --> 13:21.968
I don't understand

13:19.716 --> 13:21.968
why you got so mad at me.

13:22.885 --> 13:23.970
Because I told Mike

13:23.970 --> 13:26.013
we wouldn't cross

13:23.970 --> 13:26.013
any lines,

13:26.013 --> 13:28.057
and I know you didn't

13:26.013 --> 13:28.057
make that promise.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.101
I know our client

13:28.057 --> 13:30.101
wasn't breaking any laws

13:30.101 --> 13:33.187
with the way they treated

13:30.101 --> 13:33.187
those workers, it's just...

13:34.188 --> 13:35.732
What?

13:34.188 --> 13:35.732
Mike's always on me

13:35.732 --> 13:37.066
about doing

13:35.732 --> 13:37.066
the right thing.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.152
Now he's out there

13:37.066 --> 13:39.152
walking the walk.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.695
And the least I owe him

13:40.695 --> 13:43.197
is to think about right

13:40.695 --> 13:43.197
and wrong once in a while.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.284
You really admire him.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.284
I don't just admire him.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.453
He went to prison for me.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.705
Talk about somebody

13:48.453 --> 13:50.705
who's got your back.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.958
I get it.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.335
I'm sorry.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.045
It's just...

13:58.045 --> 13:59.297
when I went to see him,

13:59.297 --> 14:01.090
he called me

13:59.297 --> 14:01.090
"second fiddle."

14:02.216 --> 14:04.719
After that,

14:02.216 --> 14:04.719
all I could see was red.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.889
I shouldn't have

14:05.970 --> 14:08.889
fabricated that evidence.

14:08.889 --> 14:11.309
If could go back

14:08.889 --> 14:11.309
and do it again, I wouldn't.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.645
Okay, then.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.538
What happened was,

14:31.538 --> 14:33.414
it was the greatest lunch

14:31.538 --> 14:33.414

14:33.414 --> 14:36.167
I mean, it went perfectly,

14:33.414 --> 14:36.167
right up until I told him

14:36.167 --> 14:38.461
we couldn't sign him

14:36.167 --> 14:38.461
because we had a conflict.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.421
What happened?

14:38.461 --> 14:40.421
He waived conflict.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.881
He can't.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.881
It's not up to him.

It's up to Reed Communications.

ordering chicken pot pie.

Which he also did.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.270

Yes, there is.

It's complicated.

like going into it

38:47.492 --> 38:48.952
right now.

38:48.952 --> 38:51.204
Is it to do with the fact

38:48.952 --> 38:51.204
you had to hire him

38:51.204 --> 38:53.414

I have my sources.

and it doesn't.

38:58.170 --> 39:00.672
What does that mean?

38:58.170 --> 39:00.672

a better deal

could have, because

Harvey may be the best

39:12.976 --> 39:16.146

39:19.607 --> 39:20.984
He said he'd sign.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.903
That's pretty good.

I just had to realize
