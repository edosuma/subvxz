Stop that pelican squawking

00:39.226 --> 00:41.231
or I'll throw a typewriter
on its head!

00:41.232 --> 00:43.239

Come, shoo!

to him, "You're very sweet,

"but you look about 14
and only come up to my chest."

01:09.332 --> 01:11.339
Someone bang the exciting new gong!

01:11.340 --> 01:15.353
Quick, put this on.
You must be joking.

It's the big moment!

What's she saying? Too many bloody
foreigners in the house.

01:32.415 --> 01:35.425
We are not foreign, Lugaretzia.

01:35.426 --> 01:37.432
You are foreign.
I'm certainly not foreign.

01:37.433 --> 01:39.439
Cometh the cocktail hour,
cometh the man.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.446
Have you gonged
the exciting new gong?

01:41.447 --> 01:43.453
Yes, I did.

01:43.454 --> 01:45.461
Because the builders
have finally left

01:45.462 --> 01:47.468
and the penthouse floor is ready.

01:47.469 --> 01:50.679
So, now we are up and running
as a high-grade guesthouse,

01:50.680 --> 01:54.493
I will have to charge all my lodgers

01:54.494 --> 01:56.501
the full weekly rent of 80 drachma.

02:00.516 --> 02:01.519
Larry!

02:01.520 --> 02:04.730
Can we be your girlfriends
and move into your room?

02:04.731 --> 02:06.537
Oh, all right.

02:09.548 --> 02:11.554
BOTH GIGGLE

02:11.555 --> 02:14.565
Well, I think it's thrilling.

02:14.566 --> 02:17.576
Guests, a venture to be proud of

02:17.577 --> 02:20.587
and a chance to heal
the sadnesses of the past.

02:22.594 --> 02:25.605
Will you please stop growing!

03:18.795 --> 03:20.803
Bacon, known locally as noumboulo.

03:21.806 --> 03:25.820
Eggs and vegetables from the garden.
And orange juice,

03:25.821 --> 03:27.827
enlivened with kumquat.
Thank you.

03:27.828 --> 03:29.834
Now that I'm paying the full ticket,

03:29.835 --> 03:32.845
a chaser of porridge
would slide down very nicely.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.210
But of course.

03:34.211 --> 03:35.855
You will explode.

03:35.856 --> 03:37.864
It's a risk I'm happy to take.

Good morning, Spiro.

03:54.925 --> 03:56.771
Mrs Durrells.

04:01.990 --> 04:04.157
The postman
asked me to take this to you

04:04.158 --> 04:06.968
because he couldn't be bothered.

04:13.993 --> 04:14.996
Thank you.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.375
It's either
Margo's fashion magazines

04:20.375 --> 04:22.019
or Leslie's gun ones.

04:22.022 --> 04:24.029
Pretty or dead
seems to be the choice.

04:27.039 --> 04:29.046
It's strange not seeing you since...

04:29.047 --> 04:32.056
Yes. How are your children?

04:32.057 --> 04:34.064
Ah... Noisy?

04:34.065 --> 04:35.068

Oh, congratulations.

04:46.108 --> 04:49.117
Thank you, yes.
It's going very well.

04:49.118 --> 04:51.125
I hear you're running
a boardy house?

04:51.126 --> 04:55.139
A boarding house.
Yes, well, starting.

04:55.140 --> 04:58.150
We only have one paying guest,
Basil.

04:58.151 --> 04:59.154
If you hear of any lodgers,

04:59.155 --> 05:01.160
especially rich or barmy,
do send them our way.

05:01.161 --> 05:03.368
That won't be necessary.

05:03.369 --> 05:06.178
So, goodbye.

05:06.179 --> 05:07.384
Goodbye.

05:18.222 --> 05:21.233
BANG
Aw...

05:27.255 --> 05:28.940
You need to be friends with Spiro
again.

05:28.941 --> 05:31.268
Can't.
Look where that got me.

05:31.269 --> 05:34.279
Months of snivelling.
I know, but apart from missing him,

05:34.280 --> 05:36.286
we're all really tired
of having to walk everywhere.

05:36.287 --> 05:40.300
I am working hard
and I'm not thinking about Spiro.

05:40.301 --> 05:41.305
Don't mention him again.
BANG

05:43.312 --> 05:46.322
You know,
Les and I both have emotional scars.

05:46.323 --> 05:50.336
He's obviously healing his
by reverting to his more basic self.

05:50.337 --> 05:54.351
BANG
I saw Daphne in town with her baby.

05:54.352 --> 05:55.876
Oh, poor Les.

05:55.877 --> 05:58.365
BANG
Yes!

05:58.366 --> 06:00.372
You effing beauty!

06:00.373 --> 06:02.380
Not that he was ready
to be a father.

06:07.398 --> 06:10.408
Gerry... Here.

06:10.409 --> 06:14.422
It's all right, I'll go in
and polish the exciting new gong.

06:14.423 --> 06:15.427
Here.

06:18.438 --> 06:23.456
Now, she followed me.
Followed you home, yes, yes.

06:28.474 --> 06:30.481
Oh, he's gorgeous!

06:33.492 --> 06:34.495
He's a barn owl.

06:34.496 --> 06:36.501
Roger can't get over the fact
that he can swivel his head

06:36.502 --> 06:37.545
all the way around.

06:37.546 --> 06:40.516
Stop talking, please!
I need to write.

06:40.517 --> 06:42.523
Well, do it in your room.
Impossible.

06:42.524 --> 06:44.531
The girls are up there snoring...
and farting.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.059
It's a dancer thing.

06:47.060 --> 06:49.548
They love to express themselves
with their bodies.

06:49.549 --> 06:51.916
You won't let him get in the way
of any of the guests, will you?

06:51.918 --> 06:53.924
The guest.
England's worst solicitor.

06:53.925 --> 06:56.091
So bad
that he's been sent on holiday.

06:56.092 --> 06:59.263
There'll be more.
Well, they better be animal lovers.

06:59.264 --> 07:01.591
Because I'm going ahead with my plan
for a proper zoo here.

07:01.592 --> 07:04.602

07:04.603 --> 07:07.613

wildlife in area enclosures

07:07.614 --> 07:11.627
and is now a mascot.
Ulysses the owl.

07:11.628 --> 07:14.318
Who embodies the wisdom
of the animal kingdom.

07:39.728 --> 07:41.736
Theo, where do you stand
on nipped in waist dresses?

07:42.779 --> 07:44.745
It's a massive issue.

07:44.746 --> 07:46.753
I need to read up about it
before I comment.

07:46.754 --> 07:50.768

Oh, I like its boldness.
I didn't want bold.

08:14.051 --> 08:17.864
I wanted soft and attractive.
Who did it?

08:17.865 --> 08:19.871
Mrs Lekhas.
I think she was trained by clowns.

08:19.872 --> 08:21.879
The others are even worse.

08:25.894 --> 08:26.936
That's a worrying face.

08:26.937 --> 08:28.904

Welcome!

I hope you don't mind stairs.

09:10.051 --> 09:13.062
Now, this is newly appointed
and rather swish.

09:23.098 --> 09:24.944
I like to be by the sea.

09:24.945 --> 09:27.111
How long are you thinking
of residing?

09:27.112 --> 09:31.126
Perhaps a week? I will pay you now.

09:31.127 --> 09:34.981
Oh, you're not going to haggle?
Are you sure you're Greek?

09:36.145 --> 09:40.158
In return, I am writing a book so I
need to be left in peace, please.

09:40.159 --> 09:43.169
Oh, of course.
My son, Lawrence, is a novelist.

09:43.170 --> 09:45.176
Ah.
Don't read his books.

09:45.177 --> 09:48.187
He's become very smutty.
All rather awkward.

09:48.188 --> 09:53.205
And yet, you are very proud?
Yes. Yes, I am.

09:53.206 --> 09:56.216
Nobody wants a child
who is like them.

09:56.217 --> 09:58.224
That is like
giving more bread to the baker.

09:59.589 --> 10:01.233
I think we are going to get on.

10:01.234 --> 10:05.248

LAWRENCE: My turn! My turn!

10:05.249 --> 10:06.252
Ignore that giggling.

10:06.253 --> 10:08.259
That's him
with one of his girlfriends.

10:08.260 --> 10:11.792
And ignore any animal noises,
or gunfire.

10:23.313 --> 10:25.320
How blessed you are.

10:25.321 --> 10:27.327
Two writers in the house.

10:27.328 --> 10:30.338
Three, if you count
animal boy's scribblings.

10:30.339 --> 10:34.352
Mr Vangelatos is rather more modest
than you about it.

10:34.353 --> 10:35.356
Yeah, and I bet he doesn't claim

10:35.357 --> 10:38.366
that each of his so-called books
reinvents the wheel.

10:38.367 --> 10:40.052
If you think all wheels are the
same,

10:40.053 --> 10:42.381
I'm gonna make you a car
out of a bike, a tractor,

10:42.382 --> 10:44.388
a go-cart and a Ferris wheel.

10:44.389 --> 10:46.395
Perfect.
And I'll drive it over your face.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.400
Thank you.

10:47.401 --> 10:51.414
You could both do with some
of Mr Vang's generosity of heart.

10:53.421 --> 10:56.431
Why are you home early?
I found my vocation.

10:56.432 --> 10:58.438
I'm setting up
a hair and beauty salon.

10:58.439 --> 11:01.449
Argh, please stick to something
that exercises your mind.

11:01.450 --> 11:04.460
Most men already
think of women as brain-dead.

11:04.461 --> 11:07.470
Let me set you right
about female emancipation, Larry.

11:07.471 --> 11:10.842
I'm off!
It's about the right to choose.

11:10.843 --> 11:13.492
Not the right
to stick at a boring job

11:13.493 --> 11:15.500
her brother thinks she should do.

11:29.751 --> 11:32.921

Hello.

11:35.572 --> 11:38.582
Well, don't let me interrupt
your writing if it's flowing.

11:38.583 --> 11:40.589
No, it's not writing day.

11:40.590 --> 11:41.593
Yes...

11:41.594 --> 11:44.964
People don't realise
we authors aren't typists,

11:44.965 --> 11:47.614
we're... penseurs.

11:47.615 --> 11:50.626
I think
you're more of a penseur than me.

11:54.640 --> 11:58.653
So, just fill you in on us Durrells,
father died when we were young

11:58.654 --> 12:02.347
so mother has wells of resource
but she's always relied on us,

12:02.348 --> 12:04.676
me, to sure her up.

12:05.679 --> 12:08.689
Families are monstrous, of course.

12:08.690 --> 12:11.219
No doubt Bruegel was inspired
by Christmas with his relatives.

12:15.755 --> 12:17.722
Do you write about your family?

12:17.723 --> 12:20.733
No. I should, really.

12:21.737 --> 12:23.743
But they don't deserve it.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.750
Maybe Gerry will.
He's kinder than me.

12:34.784 --> 12:36.790
What people?

12:36.791 --> 12:37.794
Er...

12:39.480 --> 12:41.808
I don't want to talk about
writing.

12:41.809 --> 12:42.812
Hah.

12:50.038 --> 12:52.847
Ha. What do you think?

12:52.848 --> 12:54.855
My beauty boudoir.

12:56.060 --> 12:57.865

free introductory

12:59.873 --> 13:01.879
Mother does my hair.
Yes, and look at it.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.890
I take my lead
from the animal kingdom.

13:04.891 --> 13:05.895
Clearly.

13:06.939 --> 13:09.908
All right, fashion...

13:09.909 --> 13:13.923
I can make you a nice bowtie
by cannibalising some old knickers.

13:17.617 --> 13:19.303
Les!
No, don't trust you.

13:25.967 --> 13:28.976
So, do you own this house?
Yes, of course we do.

13:28.977 --> 13:29.981
Gosh.

13:31.988 --> 13:36.001
Oh, no, I mean this house?
Oh, yes.

13:36.002 --> 13:37.046
And a castle in Tuscany.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.016
No.

13:40.017 --> 13:42.023
We usually have to pawn something
to pay the rent.

13:42.024 --> 13:44.031
So, hide your cuff links.

13:45.035 --> 13:47.041
Am I not to be joined
by my co-tenant?

13:47.042 --> 13:49.048
No, he likes to eat in his room.

13:49.049 --> 13:51.055
Simply and without fuss.

13:51.056 --> 13:53.062
Portions befitting
a single human being.

13:53.063 --> 13:55.071
Rather than a barbershop quartet.

13:57.078 --> 14:00.129
Now, do you see the mistake
you've made there?

14:04.103 --> 14:06.110
I did mention
that I gag on tomatoes.

14:10.325 --> 14:13.135
Someone offer to help!

14:15.142 --> 14:17.149
Squeeze three oranges and a kumquat
into a glass,

14:17.150 --> 14:19.156
put it on the tray in the kitchen

14:19.157 --> 14:21.163
and then take it upstairs
to Mr Vangelatos.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.531
And don't roll your eyes at me!

14:23.532 --> 14:25.177
Mr Vangelatos isn't a writer,
you know.

14:25.178 --> 14:27.184
What? You sure?

14:27.185 --> 14:30.396
He's lying. And, he's jumpy.

14:30.397 --> 14:32.202
Nonsense.

14:32.203 --> 14:36.217
Speaking as a solicitor emeritus,

Well, I'm a trained policeman

so I'll cunningly
get the truth out of him.

14:55.286 --> 14:59.299
In terms of me,
I'm rather saddened by my laundry.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.146

Excuse me, quick visit to the lav.

16:05.035 --> 16:09.049
I am just trying to make my way
in this unjust world.

16:09.050 --> 16:11.257
As you are.

16:11.258 --> 16:15.070
Well, yes, I am.

16:15.071 --> 16:17.078
I'm sorry if I seem awkward.

16:18.082 --> 16:22.095
You have the gift of confidence.
Thanks.

16:22.096 --> 16:25.107
But actually, no, not really.

16:28.118 --> 16:31.328
I'm horribly misunderstood
by my family.

16:31.329 --> 16:34.138
That's very sad.

16:34.139 --> 16:38.153
I'm like my father was,
a man of action.

16:38.154 --> 16:41.164
And now you're considered stupid
if you like simple, honest things

16:41.165 --> 16:44.174
like physical work.

16:44.175 --> 16:46.181
And guns.

16:46.182 --> 16:51.199
I nearly became a father.
With Daphne.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.204
She's so beautiful.

16:55.215 --> 17:00.232
She carried what I thought
was my baby for six months.

17:00.233 --> 17:02.240
But... it was another chap's.

17:10.269 --> 17:14.281
Oh, um... are you all right?

17:14.282 --> 17:17.492
The question is, are you?

17:17.493 --> 17:20.304
Embrace change.

17:20.305 --> 17:23.314
It is painful but necessary.

17:23.315 --> 17:24.680
The future is yours.

17:27.329 --> 17:29.336
You are such a good listener.

17:29.337 --> 17:31.344
CHUCKLES

17:44.391 --> 17:46.397
Leslie!
Spiro.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.404
Thanks for recommending
The Durrell Guesthouse

17:48.405 --> 17:49.409
to Mr Vangelatos.

17:49.410 --> 17:52.418
He hid his face a bit under his hat.
I hope he's not peculiar.

17:52.419 --> 17:56.433
No, we love him.
OLD MAN SPEAKS IN GREEK

17:56.434 --> 17:57.958
Is he talking to us?

17:57.959 --> 18:00.448
He's being rude about you
because you're not Greek.

18:08.477 --> 18:12.491
Wasn't shouting, was I?
Sorry, Spiro.

18:32.764 --> 18:34.609
Hello.
Hello.

18:34.610 --> 18:39.587
Do you always carry a hat stand now?

18:39.588 --> 18:42.599
No, I just bought it for the house.
Nice.

18:51.671 --> 18:53.637
I haven't seen you in a while.

18:53.638 --> 18:56.648
No, I was in Athens
with my grandmother,

18:56.649 --> 18:59.659
getting help with the baby.
Ah, yes.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.670
I hear it's quite a shock
no matter how prepared you are.

19:02.671 --> 19:04.677
Yes.

19:04.678 --> 19:09.695
I left my father with her for ten
minutes, he's white with fear.

19:09.696 --> 19:13.710
It is no fun. You are the lucky one.

19:15.717 --> 19:17.724
Yes, aren't I?

19:23.746 --> 19:27.759
I uh... I built my family
a new lavatory.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.767
Well done.

19:31.775 --> 19:32.778
I have dreams it's our baby

19:32.779 --> 19:34.785
and we're together
in a little house.

20:03.889 --> 20:07.943
Any plans for the weekend?
Yes. Um, sitting in my room.

20:07.944 --> 20:12.118
That's boring.
Join us downstairs.

20:12.119 --> 20:13.924
Beards are very demode.

20:13.925 --> 20:17.939
Why don't I shave yours off?
Oh, no!

20:17.940 --> 20:20.949
I am sorry, no. I need it.
They're all desperately wondering

20:20.950 --> 20:22.957
what you're doing here.

20:22.958 --> 20:25.647
But as a beauty professional,
I pass no judgements.

20:28.176 --> 20:32.994
I... made a mistake.

20:36.004 --> 20:39.375
Let it all out.
What kind of mistake?

20:39.376 --> 20:41.022
A big one.

20:56.076 --> 20:59.608
I'm sure it's not as bad
as all that.

20:59.609 --> 21:01.133
No, it is bad.

21:01.134 --> 21:05.107
But maybe I will do it again.
Differently.

21:05.108 --> 21:07.116
Or not. Hard to say.

21:09.123 --> 21:12.132
Well, it's always important
to forgive oneself.

21:12.133 --> 21:14.140
Would you like a manicure?

21:14.141 --> 21:17.150
You have done ghastly things
to my hair, haven't you?

21:17.151 --> 21:18.837
Yep.

21:31.202 --> 21:34.211
Louisa Durrell!
Oh, Superintendent.

21:34.212 --> 21:36.901
And is it super to see me?
AWKWARD GIGGLES

21:36.902 --> 21:40.072
We agreed to have a drink, remember?

21:40.073 --> 21:42.240
You know, I don't think that was me.

21:42.241 --> 21:45.452
Yes, it was. When your son Leslie
was in the police force.

21:45.453 --> 21:50.791
Ah, well, sadly, I'm too busy now
running our guesthouse.

21:50.792 --> 21:55.287
If you have a hotel, I must visit
to make sure everything is in order.

21:55.288 --> 21:59.301
It is. But do send one of your men
over if you don't trust me.

21:59.302 --> 22:03.998
I will. And I will come myself.
Yes, you do that.

22:03.999 --> 22:07.331
I hear you do not see
your crooked taxi driver any more?

22:11.345 --> 22:13.352
CHATTER IN THE DINING ROOM

22:16.363 --> 22:18.369
KNOCK ON DOOR

22:18.370 --> 22:20.377
- Ah, the clever one.
- Theo!

22:20.378 --> 22:22.384
Hello! Margo?

22:22.385 --> 22:24.392
I've come for my haircut.
Ooh...

22:26.238 --> 22:28.405
Is that not a good idea?
What? Yes.

22:28.406 --> 22:31.255
You have no experience.

22:31.256 --> 22:33.423
And how else will I ever get any?

22:33.424 --> 22:35.430
I don't mind the few rough edges.

22:35.431 --> 22:39.806
You made it downstairs.
Oh, God. Did Margo do your hair?

22:39.807 --> 22:42.456
Yes.
Margo, I'm cancelling.

22:45.467 --> 22:47.473
Oh!
OWL SCREECHES

22:47.474 --> 22:49.160
Oh, it's the ruddy owl.

22:52.854 --> 22:55.703
Eurgh!
That is...

22:55.704 --> 22:58.513
Regurgitated mouse, anyone?
And owls are supposed to be clever?

22:58.514 --> 23:02.367
Owl wisdom
is profounder than humans'.

23:02.368 --> 23:04.534
But if it's cheap tricks
you're after, I can arrange that.

23:04.535 --> 23:06.542
Come on.
OWL SCREECHES

23:06.543 --> 23:07.747
Come on.

23:23.604 --> 23:26.614
Many gentlemen. One mule.

23:28.622 --> 23:31.631
Did Margo do that to your hair?
Yes.

23:31.632 --> 23:33.638
Well, let that be a lesson
to us all.

23:33.639 --> 23:35.003
Before you attempt to flee,

23:35.004 --> 23:37.653
do you want to tell them
or shall I?

23:37.654 --> 23:39.339
Theo, you're being peculiar.

23:39.340 --> 23:41.667
You'll get
a sympathetic hearing here.

23:41.668 --> 23:43.353
What's going on?

23:43.354 --> 23:46.685
He's on a wanted poster
in the police station.

23:46.686 --> 23:50.699
Attempted murder.
I didn't try to kill anyone!

23:50.701 --> 23:53.710
But it's true,
I wanted to hurt him badly.

23:53.711 --> 23:56.721
I hate violence of any kind

23:56.722 --> 23:57.726
but I asked my friends in Athens

23:57.727 --> 23:59.732
who know and they say
it was a political act

23:59.733 --> 24:01.739
targeting a brutal fascist.

24:01.740 --> 24:02.744
He put friends in prison.

24:02.745 --> 24:07.760
I meant to shoot him in the leg,
to show anger, but he bent down

24:07.762 --> 24:11.776
to tie his shoelace and by mistake
a shot him in the...

24:16.312 --> 24:18.800
This part.
It's the loin.

24:18.801 --> 24:21.811
Private parts.
Testes.

24:21.812 --> 24:23.818
We hate Greece's drift
towards fascism.

24:23.819 --> 24:28.836
The Nazis are polluting Europe,
country by country.

24:28.837 --> 24:33.854
And Greece is next!
Radical solutions are required!

24:33.855 --> 24:35.861
We must join together!

24:35.862 --> 24:37.868
Oh, spare me the waterworks.

24:37.869 --> 24:40.879
You shot a man
and now you descend on us

24:40.880 --> 24:42.886
with some jumped up idealism

24:42.887 --> 24:45.897
and endanger my family.
Well, how dare you!

24:45.898 --> 24:47.904
Now, hang on a minute...
No.

24:47.905 --> 24:50.433
No, I have slaved away
to get this place on its feet

24:50.434 --> 24:54.608
and now we'll be shut down
and hated for harbouring a murderer.

24:54.609 --> 24:57.619
It wasn't murder.
And he won't get a fair trial.

24:57.620 --> 25:00.951
I don't care.
I want you to leave.

25:00.952 --> 25:01.955
By tomorrow.

25:19.016 --> 25:20.541
Look, I like him too

25:20.542 --> 25:23.070
but we shouldn't be hiding
ruthless revolutionaries.

25:23.071 --> 25:26.041
You're such a copper.
And you're such an arsehole.

25:27.045 --> 25:30.055
If he's found,
he'll be incarcerated.

25:30.056 --> 25:32.062
Ugh, that's horrible.

25:32.063 --> 25:35.074
Are you thinking of castrated?

25:36.077 --> 25:38.083
Sorry, yes.

25:38.084 --> 25:40.091
Imprisoned for life or worse.

25:40.092 --> 25:44.105
As a family, we support the
underdog. You would be saying that

25:44.106 --> 25:46.112
if he shot Mahatma Gandhi
in the bollocks.

25:46.113 --> 25:48.963
What's your problem?
I think you know what it is.

25:51.131 --> 25:53.338
CREAKING

25:53.339 --> 25:55.507
LAUGHTER

25:57.153 --> 25:58.156
Well you wanted them crisp.

25:58.157 --> 26:01.527
I shall be making a deduction
from next week's rent

26:01.528 --> 26:03.173
for client mockery.

26:03.174 --> 26:06.545
It was an accident.
I got the starch wrong.

26:06.546 --> 26:09.195
I tried the shirt on,
I looked like a Cubist painting.

26:09.196 --> 26:12.205
Moving on
to something less contentious...

26:12.207 --> 26:13.570
Good vocabulary.
Thank you.

26:13.571 --> 26:16.220
I've been drawing up some plans
for the new zoo and ah...

26:16.221 --> 26:18.067
TURKEY GOBBLES

26:22.242 --> 26:23.245
Nice barnet.
LAUGHS

26:23.246 --> 26:24.250
What have you done to him?

26:24.251 --> 26:26.256
Improved his look.
No, you haven't.

26:26.257 --> 26:28.263
Yes, she has.
She has, actually.

26:28.264 --> 26:31.274
Well, I'm inspired by Mr Vangelatos.

26:31.275 --> 26:33.281
He pursued his passion and so am I.

26:33.282 --> 26:36.292
I agree.
We should all be revolutionaries.

26:36.293 --> 26:38.299
Revolutionaries...

26:38.300 --> 26:41.310
I'll settle for a home
without stupid animals.

26:41.311 --> 26:43.318
Shoo!
TURKEY GOBBLES

26:48.336 --> 26:52.189
I know this seems harsh, but...
No, I understand.

26:53.354 --> 26:55.360
So, where will you go?

26:55.361 --> 26:57.368
I must find a boat
and escape abroad.

26:59.215 --> 27:00.378
I'm sorry.

27:00.379 --> 27:02.425
But to be honest,
I'm fighting battles

27:02.426 --> 27:06.399
and I couldn't face another one.
I will be honest, only to you.

27:06.400 --> 27:10.415
You're right,
I am a terrible revolutionary.

27:11.418 --> 27:15.432
I did it all for love.
Oh.

27:15.433 --> 27:16.796
I fell in love with a communist.

27:16.797 --> 27:19.968
I wanted to win her over
by shooting the man

27:19.969 --> 27:22.457
who put her father in prison.

27:22.458 --> 27:26.471
That's so romantic. Sort of.
No...

27:26.472 --> 27:30.326
She said it was an example
of bourgeois sentimentality.

27:31.851 --> 27:34.018
I'm sorry, I...

27:34.019 --> 27:36.508
I cry easily
when I think of who I love.

27:37.512 --> 27:42.570
And can never have.
Me too. Till I learnt to stop.

27:45.540 --> 27:46.544
Look at you.

27:46.545 --> 27:50.557
You won't get to the bottom
of the garden, let alone abroad.

27:50.558 --> 27:52.565
No, really,
I'm as cunning as a fox.

28:00.594 --> 28:02.640
Good luck, son.
Viva la revolution.

28:02.641 --> 28:04.808
Don't try anything in Dorset.
He's staying.

28:04.809 --> 28:09.827
Oh.
Until we can engineer an escape.

28:10.991 --> 28:12.636
You are so kind.

28:12.637 --> 28:14.643
You can lie low with us for a while.

28:14.644 --> 28:16.692
None of us will blow your cover.

28:21.669 --> 28:22.673
What have you done?

28:26.687 --> 28:29.376
I told the police superintendent
that we were taking in guests.

28:29.377 --> 28:31.544
He's insisting
on searching the premises

28:31.545 --> 28:33.752
with his men.
When?

28:33.753 --> 28:35.719
Any time.
LARRY GROANS

28:35.720 --> 28:38.730
We need a plan.
We must get you away.

28:43.768 --> 28:45.293
Erimitis Cove is secluded.

28:45.294 --> 28:48.264
That's the best place to drop a boat
and pick up Mr Vangelatos.

28:48.265 --> 28:51.274
No, what's his real name?
The less we know, the better.

28:51.275 --> 28:53.964
Isn't that the kind of thing
one says?

28:53.965 --> 28:55.289
I'm bored!

28:55.290 --> 28:57.296
Can somebody else
watch out for the police now?

28:57.297 --> 28:59.303
Oh, well done! Very discreet!

28:59.304 --> 29:02.153
I'll get you a megaphone
so even the deaf people

29:02.154 --> 29:04.321
in the neighbourhood can hear you!

29:04.322 --> 29:08.014
Why don't we get him off the island
on the ferry, disguised as a monk?

29:08.015 --> 29:10.342
Too risky.
The police know he's in Corfu

29:10.343 --> 29:12.350
and what he looks like.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.358
Washerwoman?

29:15.562 --> 29:18.211
I'm not good this, am I?

29:18.212 --> 29:20.378
We need a boat.

29:20.379 --> 29:22.426
Coffee in the northern gazebo.
Oh, make your own.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.396
You know, I've got better things
to do than flap around after you.

29:25.397 --> 29:28.407
There's a fugitive upstairs!
Um...

29:28.408 --> 29:30.414
We wouldn't have needed
to take in guests,

29:30.415 --> 29:32.421
fugitive or normal,

29:32.422 --> 29:35.272
if you hadn't buggered up
Auntie's legacy

29:35.273 --> 29:37.440
like the great idle walrus you are!

29:39.448 --> 29:42.458
I may be a walrus
but I am a paying walrus.

29:50.487 --> 29:52.493
Spiro!

29:52.494 --> 29:54.863
I have a favour to ask.
Come into my office.

30:02.530 --> 30:05.540
I need a good boat with a motor.
Why?

30:05.541 --> 30:07.547
To take a friend of ours
away from Greece.

30:07.548 --> 30:10.558
Basil? You want to drown him?
No.

30:10.559 --> 30:13.569
Well, yes, but no.
A Greek friend.

30:13.570 --> 30:15.576
What's his name?
I can't say it.

30:15.577 --> 30:18.587
How do you spell it?
No, I can pronounce it,

30:18.588 --> 30:19.591
I don't want to say it.

30:19.592 --> 30:22.601
It's a so-called Communist fugitive.
He's staying with us.

30:22.602 --> 30:25.612
Your Mr Vangelatos?
Shush!

30:25.613 --> 30:27.619
The wanted guy?
Yes.

30:27.620 --> 30:29.626
He's a good man.

30:29.627 --> 30:31.634
He needs to get
to the nearest safe country.

30:33.641 --> 30:34.645
OK.

30:38.659 --> 30:40.707
I'm so sorry about you and Mother.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.677
Not as sorry as I am.

30:45.684 --> 30:48.694
But she's safe, well and...

30:48.695 --> 30:50.701
wonderful?

30:50.702 --> 30:53.231
Yes. She is.

Hello!
Beauty, haircutting.

31:10.774 --> 31:12.780
Hi, hi.

31:12.781 --> 31:15.309
Very cheap. I have my own scissors.

31:15.310 --> 31:16.835
And I trim pets' hair rather well.

31:16.836 --> 31:20.810
Have a think and come back here
tomorrow to book an appointment.

31:48.910 --> 31:51.760
Mr Durrell.
What brings you to our house?

31:51.761 --> 31:53.927
I would like to visit
the new guesthouse.

31:53.928 --> 31:54.932
To make sure everything is in order.

31:54.933 --> 31:58.986
Everyone, the superintendent
and two nice policeman

31:58.987 --> 32:01.957
are going to check
that everything's in order!

32:04.968 --> 32:06.974
Lots of people are snoozing.

32:06.975 --> 32:09.021
Superintendent!
Leslie.

32:09.022 --> 32:12.353
Can I ask you one thing?
Um, out here,

32:12.354 --> 32:15.004
because it's, it's personal.
What?

32:17.051 --> 32:20.021
Can I have my old job back?
No.

32:20.022 --> 32:22.028
But I'm a natural policeman.
I hate injustice,

32:22.029 --> 32:25.080
love a uniform...
SIGHS

32:27.047 --> 32:29.053
Ah! Superintendent.

32:29.054 --> 32:30.739
What a joy.

32:30.740 --> 32:33.068
You must sit and have tea and cake.

32:37.083 --> 32:40.093
All of you. I know how much
you bobbies love your pastries.

32:40.094 --> 32:42.100
Only me.

32:42.101 --> 32:44.108
My men will examine the house.
Go.

32:51.133 --> 32:53.140
I'm excited to be in your quarters.

32:55.147 --> 32:59.161
I need to see your search warrant.
You can't come up.

32:59.162 --> 33:02.171
My girlfriend's naked.

33:02.172 --> 33:05.182
She's ferocious. Australian.

33:05.183 --> 33:07.190
And will scream
so I'd, I'd give her a moment.

33:22.927 --> 33:25.255
We can do this.

33:26.941 --> 33:29.268
- Make sure it's tight.
- Yes, yes.

33:29.269 --> 33:31.276
OK, come on...

33:31.277 --> 33:32.962
Yeah, that's it.

33:32.963 --> 33:35.290
Yeah.
Yeah.

33:35.291 --> 33:37.297
There we are, we did it.

Oh.

33:50.024 --> 33:52.351
I'm a handsome man.
We should be lovely together.

33:52.352 --> 33:54.358
Oh, yes.

33:54.359 --> 33:57.369
You sleep alone, that is a waste.

33:57.370 --> 34:00.380
Well, not really, you see,
I thrash about in bed.

34:00.381 --> 34:02.387
I thought so.

34:02.388 --> 34:06.401
Oh, no, not in that way!
No, I've just...

Let me show you my owl.

34:12.424 --> 34:14.429
Ulysses.
Isn't he magnificent?

Take your time, give him a stroke.

34:19.449 --> 34:20.452
Eurgh.

34:29.525 --> 34:32.494
The wise owl
has gobbled the pretty mouse.

34:32.495 --> 34:35.505
If I wanted to be gobbled,
it wouldn't be by you.

34:36.510 --> 34:40.523
And Spiro is not crooked,
he's painfully honourable.

34:40.524 --> 34:42.208
I will inspect the house.

34:42.210 --> 34:45.542
We have information you are hiding
a communist desperado.

Hi.

Go back
and fold those things nicely.

35:46.761 --> 35:48.447
No, no, no!

35:55.793 --> 35:59.325
We meet again, Superintendent.
LARRY: No, no, no!

35:59.326 --> 36:01.815
We need to get something to help...
Get what?

Argh!

Hold tight!

36:32.766 --> 36:35.936
That's it, nearly there!

36:35.937 --> 36:38.947
Can't watch.
LESLIE: I've got it, I've got it.

36:38.948 --> 36:41.957
I know what's happened,
I heard you shouting

36:41.958 --> 36:44.968
about a Communist desperado.
Guilty, that'll be me!

36:44.969 --> 36:47.177
Yep. Who'd have thought?

36:48.984 --> 36:51.993
Like a lot of posh Brits,
I toyed with Marxism.

36:51.994 --> 36:54.000
Before realising it was tosh.

36:54.001 --> 36:56.009
That's it.

37:06.045 --> 37:08.052
So proud. Well done.

37:10.059 --> 37:13.070
Move.
LESLIE: Quick!

37:41.692 --> 37:46.549
So, we'll wait here
and hope that Spiro's found a boat.

37:58.231 --> 38:00.237
Emilia went back to her old lover.

38:00.238 --> 38:02.244
He's a better revolutionary than me.

38:02.245 --> 38:07.262
Aw...
I shot a man, that is so bad.

38:07.263 --> 38:11.278
Nah...
Love makes us do crazy things.

38:12.281 --> 38:13.486
The sweet madness.

38:15.292 --> 38:17.299
So this man, Spiro, is your lover?
No.

38:19.146 --> 38:21.313
His wife would have to die first.

38:21.314 --> 38:24.323
Do you want me
to do anything about it?

38:24.324 --> 38:25.328
Don't joke!

38:25.329 --> 38:27.335
Anyway, you'd only miss.

38:30.185 --> 38:32.031
You know I...

38:32.032 --> 38:35.885
used to confide in Spiro
in a way I can't even with Larry,

38:35.886 --> 38:38.374
or anyone.

38:38.375 --> 38:39.378
So I feel adrift.

38:41.385 --> 38:45.238
The guesthouse
was supposed to give me purpose.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.924
And we all need purpose, don't we?

38:46.925 --> 38:51.421
Keep your family safe and well,
overthrow a government.

38:52.425 --> 38:54.432
Change the world with a novel.

38:55.436 --> 38:57.282
Love animals.

39:01.457 --> 39:04.468
You're a terribly good listener.
Oh, yes, I've been told.

39:09.486 --> 39:11.493
Spiro is such a lovely man.

39:13.500 --> 39:16.511
But we can't be together. Why?

39:18.518 --> 39:20.525
I know he wants to be with me.

39:23.536 --> 39:25.543
He should be rescuing me
as well as you.

39:33.572 --> 39:36.943
Thank you.
You must talk to him again,

39:36.944 --> 39:39.593
for your own sanity.

39:39.594 --> 39:40.597
And then who knows?

39:41.601 --> 39:44.290
Be kinder to yourself.

39:46.458 --> 39:48.625
It's the classic cleft stick.

39:48.626 --> 39:51.636
How do you fight
the authoritarian state?

39:51.637 --> 39:54.646
Brutally,
then you're playing their game.

39:54.647 --> 39:56.654
I hope they haven't fallen off the
cliff.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.661
Passively, well, then
you're a de facto supporter

39:58.662 --> 40:00.668
and an apologist.
Too many words.

40:00.669 --> 40:03.358
The more I think about it,
the closer Vangelatos and I are.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.208
My novels are bullets
bringing down the forces

40:06.209 --> 40:07.693
of literary oppression.

40:07.694 --> 40:09.219
That's balls!
Are they really?

40:09.220 --> 40:11.707
But books are actually important!

40:11.708 --> 40:15.722
So I've recced and I don't think
we're being watched.

40:15.723 --> 40:17.769
Larry, find Spiro,
see what's happening with that boat.

40:17.770 --> 40:19.576
So I said,
I may be a solicitor

40:19.577 --> 40:20.740
but if you prick us,
do we not bleed?

40:20.741 --> 40:22.747
Basil, Lugaretzia, dancers.

40:22.748 --> 40:25.758
If the police arrive,
tell them we have gone on a picnic.

40:25.759 --> 40:27.765
You don't know where.
What shall I do?

40:27.766 --> 40:29.973
Put the owl down.
Oh, no, don't do that!

40:29.974 --> 40:32.783
No, put the owl down.
Right, with you.

40:32.784 --> 40:36.797
We'll go to the cove
in case something's gone wrong.

40:36.798 --> 40:38.484
Leslie is like handsome general.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.823
I've not been included again,
have I?

40:45.830 --> 40:47.838
Do you ever feel
like you have outgrown your family?

40:57.231 --> 40:59.881
There they are.
We brought food and water.

41:02.089 --> 41:03.894
Here, you'll need these
for your journey.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.099
Not, not now.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.926
Look!
Where?

41:12.927 --> 41:15.938
I can't see it.
Kestrel. Just above the headland.

41:17.945 --> 41:19.952
But, there is something...

41:28.985 --> 41:29.988
Come on...

41:45.042 --> 41:46.246
Ah, just in time to say goodbye.

41:53.071 --> 41:56.081
Spiro, what can I say?
Nothing.

41:56.082 --> 41:59.092
I think he's on his way to Malta.
Spiro...

42:01.100 --> 42:04.109
Sell it!
You'll need money to survive.

42:04.110 --> 42:06.118
The owner owes me favour.

42:08.125 --> 42:11.134
Goodbye.
This is a sad moment.

42:11.135 --> 42:13.143
You bloody liar.

42:18.161 --> 42:20.689
I brought you a fascinating book
to read on your journey.

42:20.690 --> 42:24.181
It's about even-toed ungulates.

42:24.182 --> 42:26.188
Thank you! What a treat!

42:26.189 --> 42:28.195
Don't get them muddled up
with the odd-toed ungulates.

42:28.196 --> 42:30.203
Shut up, Gerry, my turn.

42:30.204 --> 42:33.213
It's very old but you might need it.
No.

42:33.214 --> 42:36.224
I am a pacifist now.
That's a bit of an overreaction.

42:36.225 --> 42:37.750
If there is war,

42:37.751 --> 42:40.239
we'll have to get
used to these sorts of ordeals.

42:40.240 --> 42:43.249
Crisscrossing the Mediterranean

43:17.372 --> 43:18.376
Can we stop?

43:20.383 --> 43:21.387
Yes, please.

43:23.394 --> 43:27.408
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

43:34.433 --> 43:36.439
How did it go?
Beautifully.

43:36.441 --> 43:39.450
Mr Vangelatos
is on his way to safety.

43:39.451 --> 43:42.461
As sole guest,
you have my full attention, Basil.

43:42.462 --> 43:45.472
Well, in fact, I realise
I've been a goon and a swine

43:45.473 --> 43:47.519
so I... we wanted to thank you.

43:47.520 --> 43:49.486
For putting up with us.

43:49.487 --> 43:52.497
Ta-da!

43:52.498 --> 43:54.022
Well, I'm touched.

43:54.023 --> 43:57.515
Ah, not you! Just your mummy.

43:57.516 --> 44:00.204
Now, I know some of you
have your doubts

44:00.205 --> 44:03.536
about Ulysses' intelligence
and suitability

44:03.537 --> 44:06.547
as a mascot of my zoo,
given his history of vomiting.

44:06.548 --> 44:11.565
But, prepare to be disabused.
Ooh, good vocabulary.

Ulysses... hup!

44:31.638 --> 44:35.651
Ta-da!
Hmm...

44:35.652 --> 44:40.348
Margo, where were you?
Don't worry about me.

44:40.349 --> 44:43.720
I've been planning my life.
Did Vang make it?

44:43.721 --> 44:46.209
Yes, he's headed for Malta.
Oh, thank God.

44:46.210 --> 44:49.701
As I wasn't there to wish him well,
I did this for him.

44:49.702 --> 44:51.710

44:57.731 --> 45:00.741
I made the hair dye myself.

45:00.742 --> 45:04.755
Red for revolution, white for peace.
Never mind that revolution crap,

45:04.756 --> 45:06.803
those are the colours
of good old St George.

45:06.804 --> 45:08.770
Don't gang up.

45:08.771 --> 45:11.780
We love Margo.
Sorry, darling. Have a bun.

45:11.781 --> 45:16.317
You can't fob me off this time.
I'm opening a salon in Corfu Town.

45:16.318 --> 45:18.806
My life's about to begin.
No, Margo,

45:18.807 --> 45:21.816
you can't make big announcements.
Why not?

45:21.817 --> 45:23.664
Because I am. I'm moving out.

45:24.828 --> 45:26.834
Spiro's going to drive me up to
Kalami.

45:26.835 --> 45:30.849
What? No! Why, where?

45:30.850 --> 45:33.859
It's up the coast, it's paradise,
nothing to do but write.

45:33.860 --> 45:35.867
Despite what you may think,

45:35.868 --> 45:37.874
I take my art seriously.
Sorry.

45:37.875 --> 45:40.884
Sorry.
I'll write letters,

45:40.885 --> 45:42.411
brilliant letters.

45:48.111 --> 45:52.929
Oh, look, Spiro.
Back the way it used to be.

46:03.486 --> 46:06.978
Margo's gone!
We must search the island.

46:06.979 --> 46:09.667
There's a mad colonel staying
with us and he's paying Leslie

46:09.668 --> 46:10.992
to take him to kill wild boar.

46:10.993 --> 46:11.997
So we're going to stop them.
Good.

46:11.998 --> 46:15.007
I will come back tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

46:15.008 --> 46:17.014
You've got a woman, haven't you?
