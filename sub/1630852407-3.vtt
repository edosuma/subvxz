[EPISODE 3]

00:19.229 --> 00:23.582
We'll add masterpieces
as the exhibition continues.

00:23.582 --> 00:26.364
We're planning to hold a special event

00:26.364 --> 00:31.181
related to storytelling in conjunction
with the special exhibition.

00:31.181 --> 00:33.744
Some people may say it's run-of-the-mill,

00:33.744 --> 00:36.727
but true connoisseurs of art

00:36.727 --> 00:41.343
despise things that are too eye-catching.

00:42.036 --> 00:46.124
You'll have to make sure that
you don't raise any eyebrows.

00:46.124 --> 00:48.008
Yes, Chairwoman.

What is it that you want?

01:11.036 --> 01:15.533
Everything.
Everything you have.

01:16.417 --> 01:18.333
You think you're capable of taking it?

01:18.333 --> 01:21.071
You'll have to help me.

01:21.071 --> 01:24.728
No one's just born ready.

01:24.728 --> 01:29.398
How can I trust that you have
the best interests of Jun-hyeok in mind?

01:29.398 --> 01:33.263
If you're not interested in helping me,

01:33.263 --> 01:37.172
Vice Chairman Jung Jun-il
will be arrested.

01:37.172 --> 01:40.208
I called in a favor from Cho Gang-hyeon.

01:40.929 --> 01:44.563
That and I'll reveal
all of Jun-hyeok's infidelities.

01:45.542 --> 01:48.272
If I'm going to lose it all anyway,

01:48.272 --> 01:50.941
then I guess I've got nothing to lose.

01:56.044 --> 01:58.399
So, what shall I do?

02:01.946 --> 02:06.438
Fine. I will try to help you.

02:06.438 --> 02:09.907
I know that you are clever,

02:09.907 --> 02:12.938
and the fact that you asked for my help
shows me you know your limits.

02:12.938 --> 02:16.055
I like the fact that
you have clear ambitions.

02:18.024 --> 02:20.643
What shall I teach you first?

02:23.534 --> 02:28.257
You'll have to apologize first,
for testing me.

02:30.820 --> 02:32.331
What?

02:32.331 --> 02:35.320
For what you did to Madam Kwon.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.576
I was a bit surprised.

02:37.576 --> 02:41.611
So, you think I cause the death
of Cho Gang-hyeon's wife?

02:41.611 --> 02:47.392
I wouldn't have even started if
I thought I would back down.

02:57.096 --> 02:59.757
Why did you start?

03:01.632 --> 03:06.757
Kneel. And bow your head.

03:06.757 --> 03:10.539
Tell me that your sorry

03:10.539 --> 03:13.850
and cry some alligator tears
for good measure.

03:15.042 --> 03:18.346
- What?
- I know you can do it.

03:18.346 --> 03:22.846
You even married your driver

03:22.846 --> 03:27.882
so that your son wouldn't be
a bastard child.

03:30.938 --> 03:35.537
You even accepted
another woman's son as your own.

03:35.537 --> 03:37.612
Kneeling should be nothing.

03:37.612 --> 03:43.012
Would you rather send
your only son to prison?

04:13.433 --> 04:15.746
That's enough.

04:17.336 --> 04:19.324
I said, enough.

04:20.913 --> 04:25.912
I'm not such a fool as to
ruin a good thing.

04:33.212 --> 04:38.329
You, Mother, are the embodiment
of the Sungjin Group.

04:38.329 --> 04:41.932
You should always remain graceful.

04:47.523 --> 04:53.665
Just make sure to remember who holds the key to the castle.

05:26.214 --> 05:29.505
Yu Jin-seok will narrate
the special exhibition, right?

05:29.505 --> 05:30.529
Yes, Mother.

05:30.529 --> 05:34.362
The Minister said he would
take the time to help us.

05:34.362 --> 05:39.373
It's been over 10 years
since he was minister.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.992
He mustn't have accomplished much

05:40.992 --> 05:44.325
if he still uses his tenure
as a government minister to get jobs.

05:44.325 --> 05:46.992
That's why I was thinking,

05:48.306 --> 05:53.078
I don't think Yu Jin-seok would be
appropriate to narrate the exhibition.

05:53.078 --> 05:56.305
Look, Jae-hui… The Minister

05:57.112 --> 06:01.256
graduated from a top art school and has
directed the Biennale numerous times.

06:01.256 --> 06:02.875
He was also the Minister of Culture.

06:02.875 --> 06:05.537
He is a frontrunner for the directorship
of the Museum of Modern Art.

06:05.537 --> 06:08.282
If he isn't appropriate, then who is?

06:08.282 --> 06:09.956
That's my point.

06:09.956 --> 06:15.223
I don't want the speaker to steal
the spotlight from the message.

06:15.223 --> 06:17.430
Your acting so childish.

06:17.430 --> 06:20.687
I don't know what to say to you.

06:20.687 --> 06:22.638
I wonder.

06:25.103 --> 06:28.375
You two discuss it among yourselves.

06:28.375 --> 06:30.364
Yes, Chairwoman.

07:34.503 --> 07:37.603
Dong-min, go to the Prosecutor's Office
and get an insert.

07:37.603 --> 07:38.673

- Hurry.
- OK.

08:18.512 --> 08:22.742
Mother, does Jae-hui
have something on you?

08:22.742 --> 08:28.047
Or else, how could you let her behave impudently like that.

08:28.047 --> 08:30.248
This is why you won't get anywhere.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.561
You're always whining.

08:32.561 --> 08:36.572
You'll have no one to blame but yourself
if you lose everything to Jae-hui.

08:43.249 --> 08:46.345
Mrs. Yun, that was really impressive.

08:47.052 --> 08:51.829
But, do you have anyone else in mind
to narrate the exhibition?

08:51.829 --> 08:53.993
Or you could do it yourself.

08:53.993 --> 08:57.012
Can you make an appointment
with Kim Yi-seol for me?

08:57.012 --> 08:58.076
Kim Yi-seol?

09:00.531 --> 09:02.722
Oh, of course.

09:15.534 --> 09:16.657
What's so urgent?

09:16.657 --> 09:20.018
I ordered for you.
I know it's your favorite.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.033
You'd always insist on eating here

09:22.033 --> 09:25.642
even when I suggested
much more expensive places.

09:25.642 --> 09:27.773
That was years ago.

09:27.773 --> 09:29.318
Do you remember this place?

09:29.318 --> 09:32.162
The owner would chide you
for eating too much kimchi

09:32.162 --> 09:33.872

09:33.872 --> 09:35.485
Don't do this.

09:35.485 --> 09:37.656

09:39.613 --> 09:42.832
Eat. We can talk afterwards.

Welcome.

10:00.523 --> 10:03.456
How about a cup of coffee?

10:03.456 --> 10:05.352
I'd rather not.

10:11.509 --> 10:13.609

Although the record says that it was

10:23.950 --> 10:27.151
a stillbirth, the nurse says that
the child was sent away for adoption.

10:27.738 --> 10:30.056
So, it was Cho Gang-hyeon's child?

10:30.056 --> 10:32.398
There's a possibility
considering the period.

10:34.714 --> 10:36.143
What a dirty man.

10:36.143 --> 10:40.687
If Seo Han-suk is
behind all this as you said,

10:40.687 --> 10:44.380
shouldn't you look for someone else
to ally yourself with than Cho?

10:44.929 --> 10:47.485
What other options do I have?

10:47.485 --> 10:50.335
He's a dirtbag for sure,

10:50.335 --> 10:52.843
but that's why he's working with me.

too much time until now.

you can about No Yeong-ju.

11:02.543 --> 11:05.845

11:06.922 --> 11:09.346
This is my last opportunity.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.142
What about the adopted parents?

11:15.142 --> 11:18.436
They even faked the child's death.

11:18.452 --> 11:22.554
They're probably unaware that
anyone knows about the child.

11:27.004 --> 11:30.804
Hey, why are you looking at me like that?

11:32.745 --> 11:36.157
How is Hyeon-wu doing?

11:39.366 --> 11:42.142

is none of your business.

12:33.844 --> 12:35.470
They'll announce the appointment

12:35.470 --> 12:39.247
for Civil Affairs Secretary
three weeks after Cho has been confirmed.

12:41.046 --> 12:46.889
Should we notify the station of Master Jun-hyeok's resignation?

12:48.742 --> 12:52.956
First, let's see what Jae-hui does.

12:52.956 --> 12:57.768
It's cute how she thinks she owns the castle
just because she holds the key.

12:57.768 --> 13:01.555
But if she somehow were to lose the key,

13:01.555 --> 13:04.217
she won't be able to
come back to the castle.

13:05.144 --> 13:08.921
There won't be
anyone there to greet her.

13:21.044 --> 13:23.899
I think this needs
a little more soy sauce.

13:23.899 --> 13:25.725
- Daddy!
- Hi!

13:25.725 --> 13:28.646
You surprised me!

13:29.335 --> 13:32.021
Daddy, Mom says that we'll have a party.

13:32.021 --> 13:33.411
Really?

13:33.411 --> 13:36.379
You should have used the doorbell.
I would have come out to greet you.

13:36.379 --> 13:38.213
Wow, something smells fantastic.

13:38.213 --> 13:40.422
I've cooked something special.

13:40.422 --> 13:42.723
I'm hungry. Why don't we eat?

13:42.723 --> 13:44.721
Sounds like a plan.

13:45.337 --> 13:47.022
What did you do today?

13:47.659 --> 13:50.539
Son, have a drink.

13:50.539 --> 13:54.042
A drink before dinner
helps with digestion.

13:59.535 --> 14:02.657
You've been through a lot.

14:09.503 --> 14:14.108
As your wife said, I rushed into marriage

14:14.108 --> 14:18.453
with your mother without any preparation.

14:18.453 --> 14:22.766
And I was a poor dad and husband.

14:22.766 --> 14:25.744
It's not your fault
that you were born out of wedlock.

14:25.744 --> 14:29.542
But it wasn't Jun-hyeok's fault either.

14:29.542 --> 14:34.038
The fact that
I had a son as clever as Jun-hyeok

14:34.038 --> 14:37.752
after a single mistake that I made,

14:37.752 --> 14:42.290
makes me think that the heavens
have taken pity on me.

14:44.021 --> 14:46.260
Please don't hate Jun-hyeok.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.985
Because he was my son,

14:48.985 --> 14:52.266
he could only realize
a fraction of his enormous potential.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.141
He doesn't hate Jun-hyeok.

14:54.141 --> 14:56.346
Just look at his wife.

14:56.346 --> 15:00.245
He had to marry far beneath his station.

15:00.245 --> 15:01.983
Fine.

15:02.838 --> 15:06.764
So I sold your son off
to marriage to help my son.

15:06.764 --> 15:10.714
If you're so unhappy, why don't you have Jun-hyeok
get a divorce and find him another woman?

15:10.714 --> 15:13.866
I would love to do that

15:13.866 --> 15:17.464

"loves you this much."

a good example for our son.

17:20.026 --> 17:21.770
Of course.

17:22.938 --> 17:26.354
But setting a good example isn't enough.

You can't just take care
of your own children.

about it, yet they keep talking.

for the greater good,

17:54.114 --> 17:57.349
sometimes, you'll have
to roll in the dirt.

how Jae-hui behaved.

18:26.913 --> 18:29.408
It was quite annoying.

She was talking to
the Chairman of the Sungjin Group.

nor turned it down.

20:41.904 --> 20:46.063
You acted like that because
Mrs. Lee was rude to you, right?

20:46.063 --> 20:47.596
Yes.

20:49.146 --> 20:54.463
Would it make you feel better
if I apologized in her stead?

20:54.463 --> 20:56.290
Why should you apologize?

20:56.290 --> 20:58.861
Because I need you.

20:58.861 --> 21:01.038
I need you, Yi-seol.

21:01.038 --> 21:07.152
I came here to apologize to you and ask you for a favor.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.166
I'm so relieved.

21:16.266 --> 21:19.739
I've been wondering about
why you wanted to see me.

21:19.739 --> 21:21.601
I was worried.

21:21.601 --> 21:24.788
Why? You thought I wanted to fight?

21:24.788 --> 21:27.470
I'm not that kind of person.

21:28.870 --> 21:32.437
I wanted to impress you.

21:32.437 --> 21:38.067
You know, they call you a docent, but
the exhibit is narrated by someone else.

21:38.067 --> 21:44.265
It's just a euphemism
for exhibition guide.

21:44.265 --> 21:46.647
- It made you feel uncomfortable?
- Yes.

21:46.647 --> 21:50.711
without any substance.

21:50.711 --> 21:55.063
They give you a respectful title

21:55.063 --> 21:58.853
to show how classy they are.

21:58.853 --> 22:01.922
I can't say that I'm innocent.

22:03.735 --> 22:07.770
There are lots of hypocrites
who will deny that.

22:09.962 --> 22:14.186
I didn't know
you were the argumentative type.

22:16.930 --> 22:21.245
That's why I wanted to impress you.

You wanted to act like a real docent?

22:28.063 --> 22:30.106
Yes.

22:30.106 --> 22:33.269
And that's why you
wrote the report on your own?

22:33.269 --> 22:34.702
Yes.

22:37.496 --> 22:39.951
Congratulations, Yi-seol.

22:41.354 --> 22:43.728
Your plan succeeded.

22:43.728 --> 22:45.933
Everything is the same.

22:45.933 --> 22:50.305
I just need to change
the picture on the profile.

22:50.305 --> 22:52.536
OK.

22:52.536 --> 22:55.464
I'll send you the revised file right now.

22:55.464 --> 22:57.083
OK.

23:08.551 --> 23:13.351
Minister Yu! It's been so long!

23:13.351 --> 23:17.563
It seems that you haven't aged a bit.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.406
It feels like we just met yesterday.

23:20.406 --> 23:23.556
Still as silver-tongued as ever, I see.

23:23.556 --> 23:25.901
- Let's go.
- OK.

23:28.077 --> 23:30.081
Yi-seol, your report was excellent.

23:30.081 --> 23:33.753
We just need to make some revisions
and it will be perfect.

23:33.753 --> 23:36.666
And we'll have multiple rehearsals.

23:38.373 --> 23:43.462
Seeing how you fought with Mrs. Lee
makes me think you have guts.

23:43.462 --> 23:45.668
Call me when you decide whether you'd rather be
a fulltime employee

23:45.668 --> 23:48.468

a fulltime employee

23:48.468 --> 23:52.550
or a scholar artist for
the Sungjin Culture Foundation.

23:52.550 --> 23:54.322
OK.

23:54.322 --> 23:57.677
I'd better get going now.

24:10.194 --> 24:12.851
Please take a look at
the brochure before it goes to print.

24:12.851 --> 24:15.753
We'll reserve a studio for a photo shoot
if you don't like the picture.

24:15.753 --> 24:21.234
A photo shoot?
That sounds uncomfortable.

24:21.234 --> 24:25.257
I don't know how people manage
to work in front of the camera.

24:25.257 --> 24:29.661
You have to get used to it.
It's a visual age, after all.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.750
Let's see the brochure.

24:37.750 --> 24:40.303
We want to see if
the Minister's profile is correct.

24:40.303 --> 24:42.741
Huh?

24:42.741 --> 24:46.285
Show us the brochure.

25:04.959 --> 25:06.826
Hi, Da-eun.

25:06.826 --> 25:09.967
I'm almost there.
I'm in the parking lot.

25:09.967 --> 25:11.488
Huh?

25:12.753 --> 25:14.253
OK.

25:18.374 --> 25:21.292
If the Insurance Business Act is passed,

25:21.292 --> 25:23.107
you'll have to sell over half of your shares to Sungjin Life.

25:23.191 --> 25:25.863
over half of your shares to Sungjin Life.

25:25.863 --> 25:30.189
If the merger between Sungjin Trade
and Apparel falls through,

25:30.189 --> 25:33.467
you might lose your control of the group.

25:35.149 --> 25:38.361
That is troublesome.

25:38.361 --> 25:41.972
Jae-hui is quite clever

25:41.972 --> 25:44.277
and observant.

25:44.277 --> 25:48.069
Maybe you should get rid of her?

25:49.425 --> 25:51.941
Seon-mi.

25:51.941 --> 25:54.272
Have you ever hunted rabbits?

25:54.272 --> 25:56.188
I went a couple of times with the previous Chairman
and Master Jun-il.

25:56.188 --> 26:00.158
with the previous Chairman
and Master Jun-il.

26:00.158 --> 26:03.797
I hated rabbit hunting

26:03.797 --> 26:06.442
when I was young.

26:07.827 --> 26:10.336
At least you can eat pheasant meat.

26:10.336 --> 26:14.477
But rabbits are useless creatures.

26:14.477 --> 26:18.752
Also, Daddy always took Ruby.

26:18.752 --> 26:22.466
You mean the German Shepard
that you raised?

26:23.952 --> 26:27.283
I even put her in socks that I knitted

26:27.283 --> 26:30.374
so I was annoyed that Daddy
would take her out on the dirty ground.

26:30.374 --> 26:33.894
Once, she hurt her leg during the hunt.

26:35.262 --> 26:37.561
Do you know what I did?

26:37.561 --> 26:40.143
I yelled at Daddy and blamed him for hurting my dog.

26:40.143 --> 26:44.226
and blamed him for hurting my dog.

26:46.964 --> 26:51.458
I was quite impudent
for a nine-year-old girl.

26:53.133 --> 26:55.733
I raged at him thinking
he would scold me

26:55.733 --> 26:58.899
but instead, he thought it was cute.

26:58.899 --> 27:01.359
Then, he told me

27:01.359 --> 27:04.469
that you shouldn't raise
a dog to be soft.

27:04.469 --> 27:07.882
A true dog should be
able to protect her master.

27:11.362 --> 27:15.181
I hadn't realized that Daddy
took Ruby out to train her.

27:15.181 --> 27:18.284
She wanted Ruby to be able to protect me

27:18.284 --> 27:21.160
because he was worried about me.

27:23.849 --> 27:26.791
It would have been nice

27:26.791 --> 27:30.792
had he lived to see
his hundredth birthday.

27:37.828 --> 27:40.456
I think there must have been
a misunderstanding.

27:40.456 --> 27:43.389
I thought that
the Chairwoman had consented

27:43.389 --> 27:46.260
and you hadn't said anything much.

27:48.046 --> 27:51.278
How dare you act so insolently!

27:55.148 --> 27:59.664
You think you can do whatever you want?

28:04.459 --> 28:08.558
I've taken the liberty
to rehire Kim Yi-seol.

28:08.558 --> 28:12.256
I read her critique
of the exhibition.

28:12.256 --> 28:16.477
She has a special insight into art.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.181
Also, she's about to graduate
from the University of Korea.

28:19.181 --> 28:22.136
So, she thinks that she can

28:22.136 --> 28:24.291
come into my house and steal everything
just because she's clever

28:24.291 --> 28:26.288
and steal everything
just because she's clever

28:26.288 --> 28:29.841
even though she doesn't have shit?
Just like you!

28:29.841 --> 28:33.687
Why? Didn't you think you
stole enough by yourself?

28:33.687 --> 28:37.136
So you went and invited
your beggar friends?

28:37.136 --> 28:40.048
You don't have to be so offensive.

28:40.048 --> 28:44.084
I'm not stealing, I'm taking.

28:44.084 --> 28:46.086

28:46.086 --> 28:47.666

28:47.666 --> 28:51.841

kneel to people like me

28:51.841 --> 28:54.067
and beg for mercy.

28:54.067 --> 28:56.251
How dare you!

28:59.151 --> 29:01.939
Things won't be easy for you anymore.

29:01.939 --> 29:06.190
You lived a life of luxury as the child
of the owner of the Hanju Daily.

29:06.190 --> 29:09.556
Then, you married the scion
of a wealthy corporation.

29:09.556 --> 29:13.597
You didn't do anything
to get the things you have.

29:13.597 --> 29:16.526
You little…

29:20.352 --> 29:22.317
So…

29:22.317 --> 29:27.824
you'd better think carefully about
how you behave in the future,

29:27.824 --> 29:30.456
you dumb bitch.

29:51.962 --> 29:54.662
Seon-mi.

29:54.662 --> 29:57.944
Do you know what happened to Ruby?

30:04.157 --> 30:06.460
I killed her.

30:11.363 --> 30:14.970
She was loyal, even until old age.

30:15.444 --> 30:18.553
She guarded the house
and caught rats.

30:22.132 --> 30:25.388
Then one day,
when I was pregnant with Jun-il,

30:26.449 --> 30:31.160
she bit me while I was
putting ointment on her leg

30:31.160 --> 30:33.690
that was injured in a mousetrap.

30:34.741 --> 30:37.330
She must have been in such misery.

30:37.330 --> 30:39.621
It must have been agonizing.

30:40.463 --> 30:45.141
So did her a favor

Not as well as when
you were director, Minister Yu.

31:39.966 --> 31:42.855
Did you major in art?
Where did you study?

31:42.855 --> 31:44.931
I studied Western Painting
at the University of Korea.

31:44.931 --> 31:47.288
I didn't ask about your school.

31:48.162 --> 31:52.186
I guess experience is more important
when you plan exhibitions.

31:53.849 --> 31:56.003
You're quite impudent.

31:56.003 --> 32:00.344
Will the Korean art world improve
if there are more people like you?

32:00.344 --> 32:02.413
I doubt it.

32:06.539 --> 32:09.824
I heard that the Ministry of Culture

32:09.824 --> 32:12.829
was sponsoring
an exhibition for new artists.

32:12.829 --> 32:14.337
So?

32:14.337 --> 32:18.622
I would love to be part of it
if you'd let me.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.686

32:26.686 --> 32:30.776
I'm currently working
as a curator at an art gallery.

32:30.776 --> 32:35.414
Art galleries don't have curators.
You should call yourself a dealer.

32:35.460 --> 32:37.560

32:44.646 --> 32:47.249
You're quite pretty.

32:49.867 --> 32:52.958

32:53.944 --> 32:56.246

32:56.246 --> 32:59.841
about how far you're willing to go.

33:10.668 --> 33:14.349

it's time for the tape cutting.

33:26.946 --> 33:29.688
Let's talk privately afterward.

34:38.165 --> 34:40.009
Why is Minister Yu so nice to her?

34:40.009 --> 34:41.331
I don't know.

34:41.331 --> 34:43.688
She's the youngest manager
at the National Museum of Modern Art.

34:43.688 --> 34:46.973
She graduated from Illinois
and got her doctorates at Yale.

34:46.973 --> 34:51.415
She's going to direct
the New Artists' Exhibition.

34:56.547 --> 34:59.461
- I bet you envy her.
- No, I don't.

35:14.481 --> 35:18.155
I got money from my tutoring job.
I wanted to treat you to something nice.

35:18.183 --> 35:21.474
- Jeong-ho.
- What do you want to eat?

35:21.474 --> 35:24.567
Among Ministers, Assemblymen and Judges,

35:25.271 --> 35:27.260
who has the highest position?

35:28.052 --> 35:32.027
They represent the three different
branches so how can you compare?

35:32.027 --> 35:34.338
That's not what I mean.

35:37.007 --> 35:41.007
Assemblymen are as high
as assistant ministers.

35:41.007 --> 35:45.391
Judges are only as high as ministers
if they are in the high court,

35:45.391 --> 35:48.515
so ministers are the highest.

35:49.405 --> 35:52.302
What if that person
also has a lot of money?

35:52.311 --> 35:54.340
Then he's on top of the world.

35:56.663 --> 36:00.069
How about prosecutors?
That's what you want to be, right?

36:00.707 --> 36:03.985
Prosecutors are considered
level four or three officials.

36:03.985 --> 36:07.315
But not all prosecutors are the same.

How do you close a suicide case?

42:57.579 --> 42:58.954
Try to close it right away.

42:58.954 --> 43:00.874
I can't do it yet.

43:00.874 --> 43:03.584
I can close the case
if the next of kin shows up.

43:03.584 --> 43:05.713
That's all the more reason
to close the case now

43:05.713 --> 43:08.053
so that there are no problems.

43:10.869 --> 43:13.397
What's with that expression?

43:13.406 --> 43:15.981
- Do you have to do this?
- Then?

43:17.560 --> 43:20.087
I should ruin my life

43:20.087 --> 43:22.787
because of some floozy
who worked in a bar?

43:24.289 --> 43:27.789
I know you pity her.

43:27.789 --> 43:29.505
She grew up in an orphanage

43:29.505 --> 43:32.579
and dreamt of a happy marriage
even as she worked at a bar.

43:34.568 --> 43:38.178
Also, she was penniless
and killed herself.

43:40.004 --> 43:42.021
But you know what?

43:43.502 --> 43:45.903
I pity myself even more.

43:45.903 --> 43:50.398
I had parents and my dad was a judge.

43:50.398 --> 43:52.776
I was a good student, too.

43:52.776 --> 43:56.935
You know, it's not easy to get into
University of Korea even as an art major

43:57.779 --> 44:00.773
even though it's a walk in the park
compared to the bar exam.

44:00.773 --> 44:03.379
- Jae-hui…
- But people still look down on me.

44:03.379 --> 44:06.203
People like Lee Ju-yeon

44:06.203 --> 44:09.540
whose husband my dad saved
by giving up his principles.

44:10.921 --> 44:12.084
And people like my mother-in-law.

44:12.084 --> 44:15.787
You were the one who
chose to marry Jun-hyeok.

44:15.866 --> 44:19.100
It's not too late
to stop if it's so hard.

44:19.100 --> 44:21.110
I chose it?

44:21.110 --> 44:25.492
I chose to hang onto a thread of hope
with all my strength?

44:26.961 --> 44:31.372
You're working under a scumbag like Cho
because you want to succeed.

44:31.372 --> 44:33.920
It's the same with me.

44:33.920 --> 44:37.990
You may have a choice
other than Cho Gang-hyeon,

44:37.990 --> 44:41.784
but this is my safest bet.

44:45.576 --> 44:48.268
The fact that you are always by my side,

44:48.268 --> 44:50.487
that is your choice.

44:50.487 --> 44:54.076
It's not too late to stop
if it's so hard for you.

45:32.428 --> 45:35.282
[HYEONGSAN STATION EXIT 6, 08 0120]

45:44.789 --> 45:50.328
What did I do to
deserve such treatment!

45:50.331 --> 45:52.613
Honey…

45:52.613 --> 45:54.941
Will you get a hold of yourself?

45:54.941 --> 45:58.555
Hey, Ms. Oh!

45:58.555 --> 46:00.028
You know

46:00.028 --> 46:05.097
that I would never
leave my wife, don't you?

46:05.097 --> 46:09.959
- You know it, right?
- Of course. I'm sure.

46:09.959 --> 46:14.874
Mi-seon! Kwon Mi-seon!

46:14.874 --> 46:18.444
Wife! Honey! My dear wife!

46:18.444 --> 46:20.851
Where are you going?

46:20.851 --> 46:22.395
Take me with you, dear!

46:22.395 --> 46:25.742
I'm so sorry, dear!

46:25.783 --> 46:28.498
Take me with you!

46:28.548 --> 46:29.860
Dear!

46:29.891 --> 46:33.984
- Please take me with you!
- Jeez, you imbecile!

46:33.984 --> 46:35.686
Take me with you!

46:35.770 --> 46:39.794
Mi-seon! Where are you going?

46:39.794 --> 46:42.340
You can't do this to me!

46:42.340 --> 46:44.951
This marriage won't end

46:44.951 --> 46:48.762
just because you leave!

46:48.762 --> 46:53.653
Ms. Oh, what's the bill?

46:53.653 --> 46:55.149
Shut up!

46:55.149 --> 46:57.055
Want to go to a hotel?

46:57.139 --> 47:00.748
- Try to get up!
- OK!

47:00.753 --> 47:05.126
Why the hell is he so heavy?

47:41.843 --> 47:45.302
Why haven't you quit smoking yet?

47:49.858 --> 47:52.431
It's hard to wash
the clothes of a smoker.

47:52.477 --> 47:54.826
I'll just throw them away.

47:58.568 --> 48:02.699
Take a spoonful every day.

48:02.699 --> 48:05.865
And don't stand there in the cold.
Go inside.

48:05.865 --> 48:09.966
You shouldn't smoke or stand out
in the cold with your weak lungs.

48:09.966 --> 48:14.887
You're always thinking of new ways
to torture your mother, aren't you?

48:14.887 --> 48:17.171
The fact that I exist

48:17.180 --> 48:20.905
is torture to you, isn't it?

48:25.312 --> 48:27.026
I've reclaimed the shares of

48:27.026 --> 48:29.181
Sungjin Trade that I had
entrusted to your aunt

48:29.181 --> 48:32.612
and split them up
in accounts under aliases.

48:32.612 --> 48:36.487
We don't have to worry even if
they pass the Insurance Business Act.

48:36.487 --> 48:39.372
Sungjin Trade can purchase the shares

48:39.372 --> 48:40.887
of Sungjin Life.

48:40.887 --> 48:43.627
We shouldn't have tried to merge
Sungjin Trade with Apparel.

48:43.627 --> 48:46.981
That's why we committed accounting fraud.

48:46.981 --> 48:50.458
When Jun-hyeok becomes
Senior Secretary of Civil Affairs,

48:50.458 --> 48:53.001
we can get the rights

48:53.001 --> 48:56.052
to develop the remainder
of the land in Hyeongsan-dong.

48:56.052 --> 48:58.412
That is a project worth
seven trillion won.

48:58.412 --> 49:01.052
It'll be worth even more
when they start demolishment.

49:01.092 --> 49:04.777
Sungjin Trade's value will return

49:04.777 --> 49:07.700
and we'll have enough money
to buy shares of Sungjin Life.

49:07.700 --> 49:12.882
Are you going to use
Dad's company for demolishment?

49:12.882 --> 49:16.323
Yes. Your father
needs to earn his keep.

49:16.323 --> 49:19.788
Have you already forgotten what he did?

49:19.788 --> 49:24.240
Jun-il, I don't care about anything else.

49:24.266 --> 49:27.458
All my life, my only goal has been

49:27.458 --> 49:30.250
to make you the Chairman
of the Sungjin Group.

49:32.319 --> 49:36.341
You know how I've lived until now.

49:40.093 --> 49:42.096
Jun-il.

49:42.096 --> 49:44.442
You must become chairman

49:44.442 --> 49:48.385
in order to protect Sungjin Group and me

49:49.297 --> 49:53.580
so that no one can ridicule me
for giving birth

49:53.580 --> 49:56.079
to a child out of wedlock.

50:34.337 --> 50:37.031
- Nice shot!
- Nice!

50:37.115 --> 50:38.975
Excellent!

50:39.059 --> 50:42.063
Nice shot! He's so strong!

50:42.997 --> 50:44.441
Jae-hui,

50:44.790 --> 50:48.468
I heard you receive your
husband's itinerary every morning.

50:48.790 --> 50:51.911
If he's doing anything with my husband,

50:51.995 --> 50:54.012
please give me a heads up, huh?

50:54.157 --> 50:56.105
Didn't he say he was golfing?

50:56.189 --> 50:58.783
Then you should just believe him.

50:58.993 --> 51:02.282
He said he'll golf so he'll golf.

51:02.366 --> 51:05.024
But it's what happens
afterward that's the problem.

51:07.165 --> 51:09.504
Stop laughing. I'm wracked with worry!

51:09.588 --> 51:10.891
You got what you deserve.

51:11.290 --> 51:11.796
What?

51:11.903 --> 51:15.391
Madam Kwon acted the same way
because of you.

51:23.758 --> 51:24.819
This place is so nice.

51:24.903 --> 51:27.862
What do you want? I'll buy.

51:32.895 --> 51:35.815
It won't be my break for a while.

51:36.279 --> 51:38.423
I came here to give you this.

51:39.056 --> 51:41.400
- What is it?
- It's a gift.

51:41.650 --> 51:44.306
Come to the gallery wearing this
for tomorrow's rehearsal.

51:46.897 --> 51:48.141
Thank you.

51:48.285 --> 51:50.774
Thank you for not turning me down.

51:51.181 --> 51:52.492
See you tomorrow.

52:06.489 --> 52:07.657
Who was that?

52:08.011 --> 52:11.189
You can stay here if you want.
I have another appointment to go to.

52:11.412 --> 52:15.174
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

52:19.585 --> 52:21.180
Jae-hui!

52:21.782 --> 52:24.825
How can you be cold!

52:24.909 --> 52:26.488
All you have to do is tell me

52:26.572 --> 52:29.124
what they're going to do after they golf.

52:29.208 --> 52:31.344
When I think of the sins I committed
to my late Big Sister…

52:31.428 --> 52:33.140
No Yeong-ju's case has been closed.

52:33.224 --> 52:36.168
You can hate the sin,
but don't hate the sinner.

52:36.252 --> 52:39.266
- And think of my poor Gyu-seong!
- Ye-rin…

52:39.667 --> 52:42.422
Ye-rin? Why?

52:42.878 --> 52:47.305
Just try to believe
what your husband says.

52:51.323 --> 52:54.055
What if you find anything out?

52:54.574 --> 52:56.219
What are you going to do?

52:56.649 --> 52:59.021
You can't even be a mother to your son.

52:59.160 --> 53:02.423
Even if you find out where he went,
there's nothing you can do.

53:04.884 --> 53:07.969
Your words are so mean.

53:08.907 --> 53:11.664
Fine. I understand what you mean.

53:11.938 --> 53:13.658
I'll go.

53:13.742 --> 53:16.104
What else can I do, after all?

53:16.852 --> 53:18.252
You won't even listen to me.

53:19.084 --> 53:22.493
And it's obvious
what he'll do after golf.

53:47.797 --> 53:48.915
Yes, Prosecutor General.

53:50.704 --> 53:52.532
Yes, I have the car.

53:52.616 --> 53:56.786
I'm going to send you an address.
Come to that place.

53:58.569 --> 54:00.602
Yes, I understand, sir.

54:21.480 --> 54:22.910
Hello, Mother.

54:35.973 --> 54:39.465
Why did you call me to this place?

54:39.690 --> 54:43.468
I don't think I've ever
treated you to a meal.

54:44.305 --> 54:46.149
At the beginning,

54:46.387 --> 54:48.731
I was scared of you and also hated you.

54:49.012 --> 54:51.254
But I wanted to get on your good side

54:51.590 --> 54:54.332
so I thought about what I should do,

54:54.440 --> 54:58.490
whether I should buy you a gift,
and what gift I should buy.

54:59.320 --> 55:01.004
Then I understood.

55:02.374 --> 55:05.715
There was nothing I could give you.

55:06.205 --> 55:07.574
You already have everything.

55:08.371 --> 55:11.598
There is nothing
you can't get if you want it.

55:13.824 --> 55:16.614
I wonder why you're explaining yourself

55:16.860 --> 55:20.199
to the mother-in-law you force to kneel.

55:20.772 --> 55:23.938
The case has been closed on
the suicide of No Yeong-ju,

55:24.307 --> 55:26.114
the woman in the sex video.

55:26.978 --> 55:28.793
I see. Well done.

55:31.598 --> 55:33.342
I want to get along with you, Mother.

55:33.426 --> 55:34.375
Is that so?

55:34.560 --> 55:37.482
It's a good thing
to get along with others.

55:39.397 --> 55:43.598
You've tied up loose ends with Cho.
Now, it is Jun-hyeok's turn?

55:46.377 --> 55:50.114
Why? Don't you think you can
take care of your husband's affairs?

55:51.188 --> 55:52.106
No.

55:53.702 --> 55:57.989
I'll need more strength
in order to take care of his mistress.

55:58.875 --> 56:00.791
Please give me the shares to

56:00.968 --> 56:04.239
Sungjin Trade you promised to Hyeon-wu.

56:11.400 --> 56:16.222
Jun-hyeok will have to make his assets
public after he becomes Secretary.

56:16.792 --> 56:18.081
Are you sure it'll be all right?

56:18.577 --> 56:20.582
I plan to donate them
to the Sungjin Culture Foundation

56:20.984 --> 56:24.582
in return for its control.

56:45.157 --> 56:47.635
That was a good shot.

56:47.931 --> 56:49.581
Did you wash up?

56:49.665 --> 56:53.053
Now, it's onto the next destination.

56:57.781 --> 56:59.711
Thank you.

So what?

59:30.331 --> 59:31.111
Are you angry?

59:31.195 --> 59:34.808
You must not know where your husband is
if you think someone could see us.

59:36.581 --> 59:40.356
I'm sure he's off somewhere
partying with some floozies.

59:40.495 --> 59:42.300
Are you here to rub it in?

59:42.831 --> 59:45.003
Why didn't you bring some pictures?

59:45.087 --> 59:49.024
It didn't look like he had a shred
of guilt as he went to cheat on you.

59:49.108 --> 59:51.389
I don't want to hear it.
There's no reason to.

59:51.473 --> 59:53.251
Is this your thread of hope?

59:53.683 --> 59:55.071
Don't play the sympathy card.

59:55.155 --> 59:57.705
This is all because of your ambition.

You have a nice house and a nice car,

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.472
but still, nothing is enough
to satisfy your dirty ambitions.

What's so dirty about my ambitions?

01:00:09.188 --> 01:00:11.365
Do you know what's really dirty?

This is what's really dirty.

01:00:19.887 --> 01:00:23.878
It's being used and mocked
because you're in love with me.

01:00:24.698 --> 01:00:26.910
I don't want to be treated like that.

01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:31.652

- Yes, Mother.

I haven't been myself today.

You look a little pale, Mother.

01:01:59.593 --> 01:02:01.614
I think it might be indigestion.

01:02:01.796 --> 01:02:03.786
Let me get you some ginger tea.

there is a folder
on the desk in the vault.

You're very patient.

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:18.587
Ju-yeon gave it to me.

01:03:19.399 --> 01:03:23.949
She said she didn't want to give you
control of the Sungjin Foundation.

01:03:24.691 --> 01:03:26.421
What do you think I should do?

01:03:30.805 --> 01:03:32.871
Please let me talk.

01:03:35.003 --> 01:03:36.681
Kneel.

01:03:37.798 --> 01:03:39.832
Get on your knees and bow your head.

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:42.473
Tell me that you're sorry

01:03:42.557 --> 01:03:44.298
and beg me to help you.

01:03:47.399 --> 01:03:51.196
And cry some alligator tears
for good measure.

01:04:01.575 --> 01:04:03.071
Help me!

01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:06.009
Help me, Mother!

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:10.001
I just wanted to live in style.

01:04:24.399 --> 01:04:26.078
What do you think you're doing?

01:04:26.162 --> 01:04:28.879
If you'll use this incident
to treat me like shit,

01:04:28.963 --> 01:04:30.329
I would rather die.

01:04:30.419 --> 01:04:33.289
I won't live like that anymore!
I can't!

01:04:33.373 --> 01:04:34.822
Let go!

01:04:34.906 --> 01:04:36.391
Promise me!

01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:38.995
Promise me that you'll treat me well!

01:04:39.079 --> 01:04:40.696
You're out of your mind!

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.345
Or shoot me! Shoot!

01:04:43.441 --> 01:04:45.258
You're capable of anything, Mother!

01:04:45.342 --> 01:04:47.912
Let go! Let go!

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:51.610
Shoot me!

01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.110
What was that sound?

01:05:42.604 --> 01:05:47.160
[ARTIFICIAL CITY]

01:06:06.368 --> 01:06:07.842
I wanted to ask them…

01:06:07.926 --> 01:06:12.102
That's nothing if you want to become
a part of the Sungjin Group's family.

01:06:12.805 --> 01:06:15.790
What did I do wrong?

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:17.704
I'm Kim Yi-seol.

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:23.392
She's not some young floozy.

01:06:24.087 --> 01:06:27.905
I'm interested in you, Jun-hyeok.

01:06:27.989 --> 01:06:30.790
I can't wait.
Since you want to die.

01:06:32.077 --> 01:06:34.055
Are you all right, Yi-seol?

01:06:35.272 --> 01:06:38.501
It seemed my husband
made you uncomfortable.

01:06:39.282 --> 01:06:42.071
What kind of man did

01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:44.306
Yun Jae-hui choose?

01:06:45.495 --> 01:06:47.617
That's what I was curious about.
