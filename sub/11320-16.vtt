WEBVTT

00:21.479 --> 00:22.689
That startled me.

00:24.482 --> 00:25.525
Oh, my!

00:25.984 --> 00:27.444
Eun-seong sings so well.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.322
-Dad.
-Yes?

00:31.406 --> 00:33.199
When is Mom coming?

00:33.283 --> 00:34.868
She'll be here soon.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.455
She's running very late.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.666
I'm going to go out.
Watch Eun-seong for me.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.084
Okay.

00:43.418 --> 00:44.878
Eun-seong.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.297
Shall we light the candles?

00:47.839 --> 00:48.798
Yes?

00:57.599 --> 01:00.602
The person you are trying to reach cannot
answer the phone. Please leave a...

01:03.313 --> 01:04.981
-Hello?
-Hi.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.608
This is Hye-su's friend, Ju-yeon.

01:06.691 --> 01:07.776
Hi, Ju-yeon.

01:08.359 --> 01:11.654
Hye-su collapsed,
so she's in the hospital right now.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.162
You're here.

01:19.537 --> 01:20.663
Wait a moment, please.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.041
Hello.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.843
Is Ms. Kang Hye-su's guardian here?

01:35.011 --> 01:36.095
Hello.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.933
The tumor has increased
the intracranial pressure too much.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.603
We need to have an emergency operation
to remove the spinal fluid.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.106
If you consent to it,
we'll operate right away.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.569
SURGERY CONSENT FORM

01:51.653 --> 01:53.738
To be honest, her condition isn't great.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.533
She might not make it through the surgery.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.458
Please decide.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.870
LEGAL GUARDIAN: HAN JI-HUN

02:57.510 --> 02:58.595
Hye-su.

03:01.222 --> 03:04.767
OPERATION ROOM

03:04.893 --> 03:07.312
OPERATING

03:22.452 --> 03:23.411
Dad.

03:24.203 --> 03:25.163
Eun-seong.

03:27.498 --> 03:28.750
Where's Mom?

03:29.959 --> 03:31.044
What's going on?

03:31.336 --> 03:32.295
What?

03:34.172 --> 03:36.549
I asked him to come

03:38.635 --> 03:40.803
since the surgery might not go so well.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.100
I thought she should

03:47.101 --> 03:49.604
see Eun-seong at least once.

03:52.941 --> 03:53.942
Goodness.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.445
Is the surgery taking long?

03:59.572 --> 04:01.074
Is Mom sick?

04:02.575 --> 04:04.494
No, she isn't.

04:04.827 --> 04:05.912
She's fine.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.803
DAON HOSPITAL

04:21.928 --> 04:24.389
OPERATING

04:38.444 --> 04:39.529
Ju-yeon.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.532
You should

04:43.449 --> 04:45.034
take Eun-seong home.

04:46.577 --> 04:47.787
Do you think so?

04:50.540 --> 04:51.624
Everything will be fine.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.960
Don't worry and go.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.170
Of course.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.716
Hye-su has a strong sense of duty.

05:01.384 --> 05:02.719
I'm sorry for making you wait.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.554
How did it go, Doctor?

05:07.473 --> 05:09.267
Is Hye-su alive?

05:09.976 --> 05:12.395
Yes. We are over the worst.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.897
The surgery went well.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.317
The tumor hasn't been removed though,

05:17.483 --> 05:19.777
so we don't know when something like this
could happen again.

05:20.528 --> 05:23.740
Let's talk again
once the patient wakes up.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.533
-Thank you.
-Doctor.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.747
Thank you.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.128
You're awake.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.133
-Did you sleep well?
-Gosh.

06:28.888 --> 06:29.972
Hye-su.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.314
Thank you.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.031
Thank you, Hye-su.

07:15.309 --> 07:16.727
Here we go.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.190
I heard Hye-su is being discharged today.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.275
Yes.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.906
Why are you crying?

07:31.451 --> 07:32.577
Keep your chin up.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.912
When was I down?

07:35.413 --> 07:36.497
Why are you weeping?

07:37.832 --> 07:38.916
I don't know.

07:39.709 --> 07:40.918
I just keep tearing up.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.670
Are you that sad that I'm leaving?

07:44.505 --> 07:45.590
Yes, I am, punk.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.761
So when do you start

07:51.512 --> 07:52.638
your new job?

07:53.389 --> 07:54.891
I'm going to be working from home for now.

07:55.349 --> 07:57.852
I'll be conducting investment analyses
on a part-time basis.

07:58.811 --> 07:59.812
Good for you.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.439
You are impressive.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.191
Of course, I am.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.360
What's with the cats?

08:06.444 --> 08:07.653
I'm taking them home.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.656
Blackie, Cutie, and Chubby,

08:11.532 --> 08:13.284
let's go to Eun-seong.

08:22.585 --> 08:23.794
How have you been?

08:24.462 --> 08:25.546
Fine.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.673
Do I make you uncomfortable?

08:30.051 --> 08:31.844
Don't worry. I came to say bye.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.139
I'm leaving for Tokyo next week.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.391
I'm going to settle down
at a university there.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.727
Congratulations.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.605
Are you congratulating me on going
far away or on becoming a professor?

08:43.773 --> 08:44.857
On both.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.944
Don't bully the students,
and take care of yourself.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.823
What's with the cats?

08:55.493 --> 08:57.203
You used to hate animals.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.330
When?

09:00.122 --> 09:01.499
Are you confusing me with someone else?

09:05.878 --> 09:06.921
Bye.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.089
I'll get going then.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.174
Ji-hun.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.803
Congratulations on your marriage.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.644
Thanks.

09:27.441 --> 09:30.111
My goodness, you look great.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.995
It's much nicer than your original hair.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.081
With this face,

09:42.540 --> 09:44.333
anything looks good.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.005
Oh, my. Is that so?

09:54.135 --> 09:55.386
That man has

09:56.178 --> 09:58.347
so much initiative and drive.

09:59.223 --> 10:02.393
He came in yesterday morning
and moved all your things out.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.396
Your new house is nice.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.148
It gets plenty of sunlight too.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.234
I see.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.445
He and Eun-seong get along so well.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.905
It looks like he is really her father.

10:20.828 --> 10:21.912
Hye-su,

10:23.456 --> 10:26.542
you know I envy you guys a lot, right?

10:28.210 --> 10:29.920
I hope you'll be happy

10:30.004 --> 10:32.882
and live a great life together.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.053
Thanks.

10:41.849 --> 10:42.725
Hello.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.602
Ms. Kang Hye-su is being
discharged today, right?

10:44.685 --> 10:45.770
Yes.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.438
Thank you for everything.

10:49.106 --> 10:51.484
Please take good care of her.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.236
If the tumor continues
to apply pressure on the nerves,

10:54.320 --> 10:55.780
she could lose her sight

10:56.197 --> 10:57.990
or get sensory paralysis.

10:58.991 --> 11:01.410
You'll have to be strong.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.082
Let's do our best until the very end.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.293
Thank you.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.087
I'll see you at the next checkup.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.264
You're here.

11:30.773 --> 11:31.816
I didn't recognize you.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.152
I went to the salon to celebrate
being discharged from the hospital.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.447
You must've gone to a cheap salon.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.116
-It looks tacky.
-What?

11:40.199 --> 11:41.283
My gosh.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.119
What are you talking about?

11:43.202 --> 11:45.287
It was super expensive.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.289
I got it from the place

11:47.373 --> 11:50.292
that my dear Ho-jun recommended.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.420
"My dear Ho-jun"?

11:54.130 --> 11:55.214
Oh, my.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.636
Mom.

12:10.729 --> 12:12.022
My cutie-pie.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.817
Did you miss me?

12:15.985 --> 12:18.446
You're making me cry.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.865
Hello.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.158
Ju-yeon,

12:22.366 --> 12:23.492
please have a seat here.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.494
It's okay. I need to get going.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.163
-Have a seat.
-It's okay.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.499
It's their first night
in their newlyweds' home.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.168
I don't want to interrupt.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.545
I shouldn't stay here.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.922
I'll get going for today.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.674
Don't go. Stay.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.760
Call me for your housewarming.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.929
I'll get going today.
I need to watch the shop anyway.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.932
You should at least stay for some tea.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.143
Look here, sir.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.773
You shouldn't be playing
the guitar here either.

12:54.940 --> 12:55.941
Let's go.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.109
Why don't you and I have

12:57.860 --> 12:59.195
some chicken and beer?

13:00.112 --> 13:01.697
Chicken and beer? That sounds great.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.407
Eun-seong,

13:04.283 --> 13:06.535
I'll be back tomorrow. Good night.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.037
Say bye.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.371
Okay, Auntie.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.707
You two as well.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.418
Have a good evening.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.422
Ji-hun, we're leaving.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.592
-Bye.
-Bye.

13:21.675 --> 13:24.261
Will love come to me as well?

13:24.345 --> 13:26.055
-Seriously?
-Will love come?

13:27.473 --> 13:29.058
Ju-yeon is so thoughtful.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.435
-Right?
-It looks so nice.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.523
When did you do all this?

13:38.025 --> 13:39.109
Do you like it?

13:43.531 --> 13:44.698
Yes, I like it.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.994
-Be careful.
-Careful.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.246
Eun-seong.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.542
I brought Blackie, Cutie, and Chubby.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.460
-Look.
-Really?

13:56.544 --> 13:58.170
Yes. Here.

14:07.763 --> 14:08.847
Didn't they get so big?

15:30.137 --> 15:31.263
What are you doing?

15:32.264 --> 15:33.682
Let's leave the medicine in here.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.768
I'll give them to you
whenever you need to take them.

15:37.686 --> 15:38.646
Thank you.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.407
Do you want some tea?

15:54.370 --> 15:55.579
Do you like the proposal?

15:55.704 --> 15:58.082
HYE-SU, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

15:58.207 --> 15:59.375
It's what you wanted.

16:00.793 --> 16:01.877
Well,

16:03.212 --> 16:04.672
it's not very original.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.883
Are you rejecting me?

16:09.301 --> 16:11.220
I need to think about it some more.

16:11.553 --> 16:14.556
We've already moved in together.
How could you reject me?

16:17.059 --> 16:18.143
You should go.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.271
Go where? This is my home.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.399
What do you mean?

16:23.565 --> 16:25.693
You said you'd move in when I tell you to.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.654
We're married. That's ridiculous.

16:33.075 --> 16:34.243
We're not strangers.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.286
Why should we live apart?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.542
I got this house
so that we could be together all the time.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.300
Fine, I'll leave.

17:00.019 --> 17:00.894
Stop!

17:00.978 --> 17:02.062
Shall we have some tea?

17:02.354 --> 17:04.023
Where?

17:04.106 --> 17:05.274
Where are we going?

17:05.357 --> 17:06.984
Shouldn't we have our tea out there?

17:07.067 --> 17:09.069
What? No, we should have it in here.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.654
How can we have it in here?

17:11.780 --> 17:14.867
We'll wake Eun-seong.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.660
You're getting ahead of yourself.

17:16.952 --> 17:17.911
What?

17:18.412 --> 17:19.705
Rest here.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.248
I'll go and make some tea.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.542
Okay.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.425
You can take a nap if you want to.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.093
Okay.

17:39.933 --> 17:42.686
Wait. Why did you close the door?

17:42.770 --> 17:44.229
You're cold.

17:45.689 --> 17:48.108
That tickles. Stop.

17:48.192 --> 17:49.568
Stop. Okay.

17:49.651 --> 17:50.736
Stop.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.804
Why are you so pretty?

18:19.973 --> 18:21.850
You're pretty with long hair,

18:23.352 --> 18:24.937
and you're pretty with short hair.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.524
Even when you wear a wig,

18:30.025 --> 18:31.276
you're still pretty.

18:34.988 --> 18:36.865
You thought I was going to die,
didn't you?

18:42.538 --> 18:43.622
Yes.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.211
I almost...

18:53.006 --> 18:54.758
died along with you.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.221
That's why...

19:02.099 --> 19:04.101
I couldn't die.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.729
In case you'd die with me.

20:09.291 --> 20:10.375
Eun-seong.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.600
We're going for our morning exercise.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.018
Rest well.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.271
DAON HOSPITAL
MORNING MEDICATION

20:34.983 --> 20:37.319
One, two.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.863
One, two.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.657
Are you tired?

20:42.199 --> 20:43.700
-Shall we take a break?
-Yes.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.372
All right. Here we go.

20:51.708 --> 20:52.918
-Eun-seong.
-Yes?

20:53.293 --> 20:54.670
Are you happy that your mom is back?

20:54.836 --> 20:55.921
Yes.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.882
From now on,

20:59.633 --> 21:02.052
let's make your mom very happy.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.389
Let's make her happy ten times a day.

21:06.181 --> 21:09.476
She needs a lot of happy things
in her life right now.

21:10.852 --> 21:12.479
Will Mom not fall sick, then?

21:12.646 --> 21:14.690
Yes. That way, she won't be sick.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.109
Mom said that

21:18.318 --> 21:20.320
just looking at me makes her happy.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.949
Yes, you're the best.

21:24.491 --> 21:27.536
You have to smile for her every day, okay?

21:31.164 --> 21:33.375
Shall we get her a gift?

21:33.750 --> 21:34.835
Okay.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.045
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

23:17.729 --> 23:18.814
Hello?

23:19.231 --> 23:20.315
Ji-hun.

23:20.607 --> 23:21.942
I was discharged today.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.904
I'm calling in case you go visit.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.241
I asked the hospital,
and they said it was okay.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.244
Why did you do that? You should have
taken more time to recover.

23:32.786 --> 23:35.080
I'm sick of the hospital.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.542
I'm going to my hometown.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.962
I'll be recuperating there,

23:42.921 --> 23:45.215
so take care of your family.

23:45.715 --> 23:46.758
Let's meet up.

23:46.842 --> 23:47.926
It's okay.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.344
There's no need.

23:49.427 --> 23:50.512
No.

23:50.637 --> 23:51.847
I'll call you back.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.809
-Is it Grandma?
-Yes.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.771
Let's go in. Mom must be waiting.

24:01.731 --> 24:03.316
Mom.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.484
Hi.

24:04.734 --> 24:06.027
What took you so long?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.613
Dad said we needed to get you a gift,

24:08.697 --> 24:10.198
so we went somewhere far!

24:11.116 --> 24:12.701
Here. Here's your gift.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.454
They sell this in the morning?

24:16.580 --> 24:18.165
I banged on the door and woke the owner.

24:18.790 --> 24:19.875
Like this.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.587
You like that.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.173
Nuts and tteokbokki with sesame seeds.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.633
It's tteokbokki
with nuts and sesame seeds.

24:28.925 --> 24:31.178
-Right.
-Who eats this in the morning though?

24:31.636 --> 24:33.680
-You don't want it?
-You don't want it?

24:36.141 --> 24:38.894
Go and wash your hands, both of you.
Let's have breakfast.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.605
Gosh, when did you make all of this?

24:41.688 --> 24:42.856
When did you make all of this?

24:43.690 --> 24:45.609
I used up everything we had.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.444
Go and wash your hands, both of you.

24:47.777 --> 24:48.737
Go.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.488
-Let's go.
-Hurry.

24:58.830 --> 24:59.998
Here.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.543
Let's eat.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.462
Thank you for the meal.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.714
Yes, thank you for the meal.

25:07.923 --> 25:11.092
Dad, you should thank her too.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.261
-Thank you for the meal.
-Good job.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.057
We didn't have much in the fridge.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.559
I'll go grocery shopping later
and make you something nicer tomorrow.

25:19.768 --> 25:22.604
I'll surprise you with a huge feast.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.940
Okay. I'll be surprised.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.028
How is it?

25:30.278 --> 25:31.321
Eun-seong, how is it?

25:31.404 --> 25:33.240
Isn't my mom a really good cook?

25:35.075 --> 25:36.493
Your mom is the best.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.536
Is there anything she can't do?

25:38.870 --> 25:39.913
She's perfect.

25:39.996 --> 25:41.706
She can't be human. Right?

25:49.631 --> 25:51.258
Shall I try some too?

25:56.846 --> 25:57.806
It's good.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.233
I'll see you later. Bye.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.287
Hello, Mr. Park.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.040
The Chairman collapsed.

27:05.665 --> 27:06.541
What?

27:06.624 --> 27:09.127
He has just been discharged
and is in his study now.

27:09.210 --> 27:11.921
The doctors said he should stay longer
at the hospital,

27:12.005 --> 27:14.257
but he insisted that he had to work.

27:14.341 --> 27:15.550
What's wrong with him?

27:16.134 --> 27:18.261
His strokes seem to have returned.

27:19.596 --> 27:20.722
Okay.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.057
I'll call you back.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.434
Is someone sick?

27:25.185 --> 27:26.269
No, it's nothing.

27:26.561 --> 27:27.645
Bye, Eun-seong.

27:42.911 --> 27:43.995
Dad.

27:45.288 --> 27:46.373
Yes.

27:46.915 --> 27:47.999
You're here.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.087
Were you very ill?

28:09.229 --> 28:10.563
Did you catch a cold too?

28:15.360 --> 28:16.569
I guess

28:17.570 --> 28:20.073
I don't have much time left now.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.118
When I collapsed last time,

28:23.535 --> 28:25.328
I should've died then.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.833
Neither my kids nor my wife

28:31.668 --> 28:34.379
understand how I feel. No one does.

28:36.673 --> 28:37.841
I heard that Mom and Jeong-hun

28:38.425 --> 28:39.676
went to the States.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.053
Yes.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.180
I couldn't care less.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.476
Are you eating well?

28:48.977 --> 28:50.603
I feel pathetic while I'm eating too.

28:51.354 --> 28:52.689
Everything seems pointless.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.776
I should just die.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.781
I'm very disappointed in you.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.368
I thought you took after me

29:05.994 --> 29:07.746
and had ambition.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.498
I never thought you'd betray me like this.

29:11.124 --> 29:14.085
And for a sick girl too.

29:14.627 --> 29:15.712
Dad,

29:16.379 --> 29:17.547
hang in there.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.966
Don't skip your meals,

29:20.759 --> 29:22.135
and take care of yourself.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.263
I'll get going now.

29:29.893 --> 29:31.060
What do you

29:32.312 --> 29:34.564
have against me?

29:35.857 --> 29:36.941
Do you even

29:37.776 --> 29:39.611
consider me as your father?

29:42.363 --> 29:44.407
I have nothing against you.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.327
I'm grateful.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.246
I'm grateful to you for having me

29:50.747 --> 29:52.332
and for raising me.

29:53.792 --> 29:54.876
I'm grateful to you

29:55.502 --> 29:58.254
for giving me the opportunities
to experience great things.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.425
I can't return to the company,

30:03.802 --> 30:05.345
but I'll always be

30:05.845 --> 30:07.013
your son.

30:07.263 --> 30:09.224
So you need to return.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.226
Come back.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.228
How long will you live like that for?

30:13.436 --> 30:14.521
Dad,

30:15.855 --> 30:18.441
I'm happy and satisfied
with my life right now.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.195
What nonsense.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.989
Try doing that for six more months.

30:25.448 --> 30:26.950
See if you'll be able to say you're happy.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.118
Take care of yourself, Dad.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.246
I'll get going now.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.206
I'll come again.

30:39.796 --> 30:40.880
You fool.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.551
You can't even take
what's being handed to you!

31:04.320 --> 31:06.114
-Hi, Eun-seong.
-Good morning.

31:06.197 --> 31:08.074
Good morning. Goodbye.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.909
Be careful.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.162
Goodbye.

31:28.511 --> 31:29.512
Mom.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.680
Hi.

31:31.931 --> 31:33.057
How are you feeling?

31:34.058 --> 31:35.184
Can't you tell?

31:35.351 --> 31:36.436
I'm feeling great.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.229
Where's Uncle?

31:38.313 --> 31:39.772
He went back home first.

31:40.189 --> 31:41.774
You know how impatient he is.

31:43.192 --> 31:44.527
Do you have to go?

31:46.988 --> 31:48.072
Ji-hun.

31:48.364 --> 31:51.034
If it isn't something good,
I'll hear it another time.

31:51.451 --> 31:52.619
That's not it.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.166
What's this?

31:58.333 --> 31:59.792
How can I do nothing for my son

31:59.876 --> 32:02.086
when he's getting married?

32:03.546 --> 32:04.756
It's a wedding gift.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.175
Buy her a ring.

32:08.843 --> 32:10.094
Thank you.

32:10.845 --> 32:13.056
The more the better,
while you're feeling generous.

32:13.806 --> 32:14.891
How much is it?

32:18.478 --> 32:19.771
Thank you for understanding.

32:21.230 --> 32:23.733
I thought perhaps I'd go see her
before I leave,

32:24.067 --> 32:26.027
but I think it's best if I don't.

32:27.195 --> 32:30.615
She might feel bad if she sees me.

32:34.327 --> 32:36.412
Knowing her personality,

32:36.955 --> 32:38.456
it must have not been easy for her

32:38.706 --> 32:40.917
to do everything the way you want.

32:42.293 --> 32:44.879
Be grateful that she's willing
to live with you,

32:45.088 --> 32:46.214
and be good to her.

32:48.299 --> 32:49.801
I worked super hard

32:50.218 --> 32:51.427
to persuade her.

32:55.515 --> 32:56.599
Be happy.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.060
I'll respect your decision.

33:00.353 --> 33:01.771
It is what it is.

33:02.188 --> 33:05.692
I hope the two of you will be strong
and get through everything together.

33:08.069 --> 33:09.153
Thank you.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.574
You too, Mom.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.327
-Be strong.
-Okay.

33:17.036 --> 33:18.204
Be happy.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.373
Thank you.

33:24.752 --> 33:26.045
-Mom.
-Yes?

33:26.254 --> 33:27.255
Look at this.

33:27.338 --> 33:28.715
I drew you and Dad.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.342
That looks great.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.428
How's the color of the dress?
Do you like it?

33:33.511 --> 33:34.470
Yes.

33:35.221 --> 33:36.305
Is this me?

33:36.514 --> 33:37.598
I look great.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.851
Do you want a crown?

33:41.102 --> 33:42.186
What color?

33:42.979 --> 33:44.397
Any color.

33:46.816 --> 33:48.526
You draw the crown.

33:48.901 --> 33:49.986
Shall I?

33:52.238 --> 33:53.531
Okay.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.331
What's wrong?

34:02.749 --> 34:04.042
Nothing. Sorry.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.352
Mom.

34:26.314 --> 34:27.732
Eun-seong.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.152
My eyes have

34:31.986 --> 34:33.613
gotten bad.

34:34.113 --> 34:35.907
Then you need glasses.

34:36.741 --> 34:37.825
Right?

34:38.826 --> 34:40.453
I need glasses.

34:41.829 --> 34:44.040
I'm sorry,
but I don't think I can draw it.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.584
Sorry.

34:47.001 --> 34:48.669
Keep drawing, okay?

34:49.253 --> 34:50.338
Okay.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.279
Mother.

35:17.323 --> 35:18.407
Are you okay?

35:21.577 --> 35:23.162
-Is this it?
-Yes. Please come in.

35:23.246 --> 35:24.789
-I'll take that.
-It's okay.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.252
My sweet Eun-seong.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.962
Did you miss me?

35:31.045 --> 35:32.130
Yes.

35:33.548 --> 35:34.799
What's all this?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.175
This?

35:37.844 --> 35:39.720
Snacks for you.

35:40.096 --> 35:41.472
Thank you.

35:44.350 --> 35:45.476
Don't they look delicious?

35:47.311 --> 35:49.063
-Mother.
-Grandma.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.690
-Yes?
-Let me draw you.

35:50.773 --> 35:51.899
Okay.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.652
Draw me pretty, okay?

35:54.735 --> 35:56.195
-Nice and pretty.
-Okay.

35:56.529 --> 35:57.530
Right.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.615
I made some side dishes

35:59.907 --> 36:01.951
and some porridge.

36:02.785 --> 36:05.663
Eat them even if you don't have
an appetite, okay?

36:06.414 --> 36:07.498
Thank you.

36:08.749 --> 36:10.793
Let me take a look around your house.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.504
All right. So this is Eun-seong's room.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.672
How pretty.

36:15.923 --> 36:17.008
And...

36:17.383 --> 36:19.177
Goodness.

36:19.302 --> 36:22.138
Your kitchen is pretty full too.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.309
Mother.

36:26.392 --> 36:27.560
Okay.

36:27.810 --> 36:28.895
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

36:28.978 --> 36:31.272
-I'll make you some coffee.
-No, I don't want coffee.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.440
You sit down.

36:41.324 --> 36:42.408
Hye-su,

36:43.201 --> 36:46.787
pretend like I'm your real mother
from now on

36:47.121 --> 36:48.456
and rely on me as much as you want to.

36:49.498 --> 36:50.708
The truth is,

36:51.250 --> 36:53.169
I've always wanted to do this.

36:53.878 --> 36:55.421
You know I don't have a daughter.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.215
Don't feel bad,

36:58.090 --> 37:00.176
and ask me to do everything for you.

37:04.597 --> 37:05.806
Thank you.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.771
When you were in the hospital,

37:12.897 --> 37:14.982
I prayed so much.

37:16.192 --> 37:18.694
I thought I was being punished

37:20.029 --> 37:22.323
for being so horrible to you.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.659
Mother.

37:25.409 --> 37:28.037
You always refused to ask others for help.

37:28.287 --> 37:30.623
This all happened to force you
to ask other people for help.

37:30.706 --> 37:31.791
Don't you see that?

37:32.291 --> 37:33.501
Right, Eun-seong?

37:34.669 --> 37:36.045
You're right.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.469
Don't think too much about Eun-seong

37:43.719 --> 37:44.929
and from now on,

37:45.554 --> 37:46.681
think only of yourself,

37:47.098 --> 37:48.182
okay?

37:53.771 --> 37:54.981
Thank you.

37:56.148 --> 37:58.359
That's my girl.

37:59.026 --> 38:00.820
You silly girl.

38:04.407 --> 38:05.491
It's okay.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.034
It's okay.

38:16.043 --> 38:18.587
I heard we invited Hye-su tonight.

38:18.838 --> 38:21.757
Yes. I want to scold her
for deceiving us all this time.

38:22.383 --> 38:23.634
She made a fool out of me.

38:24.260 --> 38:25.469
What does she see in him?

38:26.053 --> 38:29.557
Did you like Hye-su?

38:29.849 --> 38:30.725
What?

38:30.808 --> 38:31.934
Never mind.

38:32.768 --> 38:36.147
By the way, Hye-su is a little sick.

38:36.814 --> 38:39.108
She can't really eat greasy food.

38:39.191 --> 38:41.569
Flour isn't good, either.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.237
A vegetable dish might be better.

38:43.738 --> 38:44.822
How is she sick?

38:45.072 --> 38:46.157
Well...

38:46.324 --> 38:49.577
It's nothing. I don't know that much.

38:49.660 --> 38:51.287
Tell me. What's wrong with her?

38:51.454 --> 38:53.456
Well...

38:54.540 --> 38:55.624
She's pregnant, isn't she?

38:55.833 --> 38:57.752
No, she's not.

38:59.295 --> 39:00.379
My goodness.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.798
I enjoyed bad-mouthing Mr. Han.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.468
My days feel empty without him.

39:06.844 --> 39:09.263
He's a good guy, I tell you.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.098
I never said he was a good guy.

39:12.683 --> 39:13.893
I never said that.

39:14.643 --> 39:16.103
He is a good guy.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.191
Why are you putting on so much makeup?

39:22.109 --> 39:23.736
You're pretty without it.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.322
I want to look prettier.

39:27.281 --> 39:29.784
Don't tell them I'm sick, okay?

39:30.242 --> 39:31.327
Okay.

39:33.871 --> 39:34.955
Do I look okay?

39:35.331 --> 39:36.374
You look pretty.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.072
Could you

40:09.490 --> 40:11.742
please hold my hand?

40:12.952 --> 40:14.453
I want us to look like a couple.

40:21.669 --> 40:22.753
Thank you.

40:33.556 --> 40:36.016
-All right.
-Okay, then.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.936
Mr. Han, our ex-director
of the head office,

40:39.019 --> 40:41.063
wants to apologize for keeping

40:41.147 --> 40:44.608
his relationship a secret
and deceiving his employees.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.193
A round of applause!

40:48.779 --> 40:51.574
I used all sorts of cheap means

40:51.824 --> 40:53.159
to nag

40:53.784 --> 40:54.952
and to pick on you.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.996
I feel a bit bad

40:57.788 --> 40:58.914
trying to suddenly act all nice.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.249
Anyway,

41:00.791 --> 41:03.419
you are all special colleagues

41:03.669 --> 41:05.045
to both me and Hye-su,

41:05.754 --> 41:07.590
so we wanted to announce this ourselves.

41:09.884 --> 41:12.219
We got married.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.016
Married for real.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.893
What do you mean, for real?

41:19.059 --> 41:20.269
Come on.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.646
It means that this beautiful man

41:22.730 --> 41:25.691
and beautiful woman truly love
each other, Chef.

41:25.774 --> 41:27.234
-I see.
-Why are you being so picky?

41:27.943 --> 41:28.944
Sorry I'm late.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.113
-Have a seat.
-Hello.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.032
I mean,

41:33.157 --> 41:35.826
I want a more detailed explanation.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.120
Why did you keep it a secret all this time

41:38.204 --> 41:41.457
and why did you let so many rumors fly?

41:41.540 --> 41:44.502
Chef, we've gathered here to congratulate
the couple, right?

41:44.585 --> 41:46.128
-We're here to congratulate them.
-Yes.

41:46.212 --> 41:47.963
Did you come to interrogate
and torture them?

41:48.047 --> 41:49.882
-Did you?
-No.

41:51.884 --> 41:52.968
I'm sorry.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.720
It's because I was a fool.

41:57.181 --> 41:58.390
Please go easy on me.

41:58.807 --> 42:01.268
I went crazy trying to win her over.

42:02.811 --> 42:05.064
But still. Why--

42:05.147 --> 42:06.774
I finally won her over.

42:07.024 --> 42:09.151
If you keep bringing up my past,
she'll kick me out.

42:09.235 --> 42:10.611
Still.

42:10.694 --> 42:12.196
Do you have something to say?

42:12.279 --> 42:13.989
-No, I don't.
-Thought so.

42:14.073 --> 42:15.991
Okay, then.

42:16.075 --> 42:18.244
Let's stop making excuses, and...

42:19.578 --> 42:20.621
That's right.

42:20.704 --> 42:24.291
I think they should stand up
and sing us a song.

42:26.168 --> 42:27.294
-Sing!
-Sing!

42:27.378 --> 42:29.922
-Sing!
-Sing!

42:30.005 --> 42:32.424
-Sing!
-Sing!

42:32.508 --> 42:33.676
-Sing!
-Sing!

42:33.759 --> 42:34.677
Sing.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.136
Sing!

42:36.220 --> 42:38.556
-Sing!
-Sing!

42:38.639 --> 42:40.891
-Sing!
-Sing!

42:44.603 --> 42:45.688
Then, you should...

42:50.067 --> 42:51.235
-Good job.
-Kiss!

42:51.318 --> 42:52.570
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

42:52.653 --> 42:53.821
-Good job.
-Kiss!

42:53.904 --> 42:55.030
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

42:55.114 --> 42:56.532
-Kiss!
-Hurry up!

42:56.615 --> 42:58.367
-Hurry up!
-Hurry up!

42:58.450 --> 42:59.577
Okay.

43:00.077 --> 43:01.287
We'll kiss,

43:02.413 --> 43:04.331
so please forget about my past.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.043
And give us your blessing.

43:11.046 --> 43:12.131
Let's kiss.

43:16.051 --> 43:17.177
How cute.

43:31.358 --> 43:33.068
Are you that happy?

43:35.029 --> 43:36.113
Are you all right?

43:37.364 --> 43:38.616
Yes, I'm happy.

43:41.619 --> 43:42.703
Sit down.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.957
Okay, then.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.125
Let's eat...

43:48.208 --> 43:50.127
I'm going to call Eun-seong.

43:50.210 --> 43:51.629
-Enjoy.
-Let's eat.

43:51.712 --> 43:54.340
Let's eat now

43:54.506 --> 43:56.800
and continue asking our questions.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.886
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

43:58.969 --> 44:00.846
-Go on.
-Let's eat.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.390
-I'm hungry.
-Everything looks good.

44:03.682 --> 44:05.059
Enjoy.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.855
Ju-yeon, why haven't you been
coming to see us?

44:09.938 --> 44:11.690
-What are you doing?
-Back off.

44:11.774 --> 44:13.359
I'm drinking with her.

44:14.026 --> 44:15.235
Are you okay?

44:15.361 --> 44:16.445
I'm okay.

44:17.571 --> 44:18.447
Isn't it good?

44:18.530 --> 44:19.406
-Yes.
-Enjoy.

44:19.490 --> 44:20.449
I will.

44:22.868 --> 44:25.746
Chef, why is the soup so salty today?

44:25.829 --> 44:27.039
It's not salty.

44:31.835 --> 44:32.961
Who seasoned this?

44:33.587 --> 44:34.755
Did you season it beforehand?

44:34.880 --> 44:35.881
I thought you didn't.

44:35.964 --> 44:37.591
You punk, how could you do this
to our guests?

44:39.635 --> 44:40.719
It's okay.

44:45.182 --> 44:47.059
Ms. Kang, isn't it salty?

44:47.351 --> 44:48.435
What?

44:49.645 --> 44:50.979
-Isn't it salty?
-It is.

44:57.611 --> 44:58.695
Don't eat too much salt.

44:59.029 --> 45:00.114
It's bland.

45:09.623 --> 45:10.749
Hye-su,

45:10.999 --> 45:13.252
do you have something against me?

45:13.460 --> 45:14.920
No, Chef.

45:15.295 --> 45:17.464
It's bland, but it's not that bad.

45:18.132 --> 45:19.341
She says this is bland.

45:20.926 --> 45:23.762
Did something happen to your taste buds?

45:23.846 --> 45:24.888
Stop it.

45:24.972 --> 45:27.266
What? What is it?

45:32.438 --> 45:35.983
Chef, it's so bland. Gosh.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.901
-It's bland?
-Yes.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.111
It's totally bland.

45:39.194 --> 45:40.696
I know, right?

45:40.863 --> 45:43.615
Chef, you must have done that

45:43.699 --> 45:45.993
for Hye-su's health, right?

45:46.326 --> 45:48.370
-Well...
-You're so thoughtful.

46:08.974 --> 46:11.351
This couple is acting strange.

46:11.518 --> 46:13.812
They say married couples
start to resemble each other.

46:13.896 --> 46:16.648
Their taste buds must become
similar too. Right?

46:17.107 --> 46:18.358
That's right.

46:19.485 --> 46:20.652
That's enough.

46:23.489 --> 46:24.490
Gosh.

46:31.622 --> 46:34.708
I must have gotten overly excited
about being back here after so long.

46:35.792 --> 46:36.877
Hye-su,

46:37.169 --> 46:38.253
are you...

46:40.255 --> 46:41.381
Are you...

46:42.174 --> 46:43.258
Chef!

46:43.342 --> 46:45.385
I'm not, Chef.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.262
You are.

46:47.513 --> 46:49.306
-Gosh, Chef.
-You are.

46:49.389 --> 46:52.059
Chef, you are so mischievous.

46:52.142 --> 46:53.727
She definitely is.

46:53.810 --> 46:54.895
She is.

46:56.688 --> 46:59.358
Congratulations

46:59.691 --> 47:01.652
Congratulations

47:01.985 --> 47:05.197
Congratulations on your baby

47:05.322 --> 47:08.075
All right, then.
Why don't we have a drink?

47:08.158 --> 47:09.451
-Sounds good.
-Let's drink.

47:09.535 --> 47:11.078
Everyone, raise your glass.

47:11.161 --> 47:13.789
To Hye-su's baby.

47:13.872 --> 47:14.915
Hye-su.

47:14.998 --> 47:16.625
Congratulations, Hye-su.

47:20.837 --> 47:23.090
-Ji-hun.
-Let's go.

47:23.340 --> 47:24.216
Let's go.

47:24.299 --> 47:25.509
-Bye.
-Be good to her.

47:26.260 --> 47:27.261
Get home safely.

47:27.344 --> 47:29.179
Let's get another round.

47:29.263 --> 47:30.430
Wait for me.

47:31.431 --> 47:33.183
-Goodbye.
-Let's go.

47:38.605 --> 47:39.898
Thanks for today.

47:40.482 --> 47:41.567
For what?

47:41.900 --> 47:43.402
The dish really was bland.

47:44.528 --> 47:46.405
Do you want to go for a drive somewhere?

47:47.281 --> 47:48.240
No.

47:48.532 --> 47:49.825
Let's pick up Eun-seong.

47:50.576 --> 47:51.660
Okay.

47:57.332 --> 47:58.417
Thank you.

47:59.209 --> 48:00.294
For what?

48:01.336 --> 48:03.213
Why did I cause trouble
on a day like this?

48:04.298 --> 48:05.382
Right?

48:09.344 --> 48:11.847
I'm going to cry a little bit. Don't look.

48:12.306 --> 48:13.390
I'm going to cry first.

48:13.807 --> 48:14.891
Don't look.

48:15.475 --> 48:17.060
Why would you cry?

48:18.770 --> 48:20.981
-Goodness.
-The sun has already set.

48:21.648 --> 48:23.233
That isn't very comforting.

48:23.817 --> 48:24.985
I mean it.

48:27.571 --> 48:28.697
No kisses allowed.

48:30.115 --> 48:31.199
Shall we go?

48:34.202 --> 48:35.370
Let's go.

48:36.580 --> 48:37.748
And we're off.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.545
A long, long time ago,

48:44.338 --> 48:46.673
there was a girl named Hye-su.

48:48.008 --> 48:49.343
That's you.

48:50.010 --> 48:51.303
Yes, it's me.

48:52.137 --> 48:53.430
It was when I was little.

48:55.641 --> 48:57.142
When I was very little,

48:59.311 --> 49:02.648
my mom and dad passed away.

49:04.691 --> 49:07.986
So Hye-su was raised by her grandma.

49:08.654 --> 49:10.113
Your grandma?

49:10.197 --> 49:12.115
Yes, my grandma.

49:13.367 --> 49:17.079
Her grandma loved her so much.

49:17.954 --> 49:21.291
Even though she had no parents,
Hye-su didn't have a hard time at all.

49:24.711 --> 49:25.796
Eun-seong,

49:27.506 --> 49:28.840
people aren't

49:29.341 --> 49:31.635
always miserable
because they don't have something.

49:35.972 --> 49:37.641
Things aren't hard for them

49:38.517 --> 49:41.103
because their mom or dad isn't there.

49:42.646 --> 49:44.106
It's because

49:45.357 --> 49:46.650
they want to be loved.

49:49.528 --> 49:50.612
Eun-seong,

49:51.905 --> 49:54.074
I hope you become

49:55.242 --> 49:57.786
someone who gives love to other people.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.081
If you do that,

50:02.040 --> 50:04.876
everything in the entire world will
become your mom for you.

50:07.295 --> 50:08.380
The trees,

50:08.880 --> 50:09.965
the grass,

50:10.298 --> 50:11.383
the rocks.

50:12.134 --> 50:14.344
Everything will become your mom.

50:16.221 --> 50:18.181
That's silly.

50:18.515 --> 50:21.435
It is not. It's true.

50:30.318 --> 50:31.403
What?

51:00.432 --> 51:02.058
My pretty girl, Eun-seong.

51:05.312 --> 51:08.690
Even if I can't see you,

51:10.108 --> 51:11.568
I can still

51:13.236 --> 51:14.321
see you.

51:16.531 --> 51:17.949
Because I love you.

51:20.827 --> 51:22.454
I can see you because I love you.

51:23.997 --> 51:25.081
Mom,

51:26.583 --> 51:28.627
did your eyes get very bad?

51:31.963 --> 51:33.048
Yes.

51:35.091 --> 51:36.635
They got very bad.

51:38.345 --> 51:41.181
You'll have to help me out a lot.

51:41.973 --> 51:43.475
Don't worry.

51:44.684 --> 51:47.813
I'll help you out a lot.

51:49.314 --> 51:50.398
Thanks.

51:51.983 --> 51:53.068
Please

51:56.780 --> 51:58.323
get glasses.

52:01.618 --> 52:02.702
Okay.

52:03.537 --> 52:06.581
I will get glasses.

52:07.624 --> 52:09.543
Thank you, Eun-seong.

52:10.669 --> 52:14.965
I will love you more, okay?

52:15.882 --> 52:19.302
Okay. I will love you a lot too!

52:19.636 --> 52:20.846
Give me a kiss.

52:50.625 --> 52:51.710
Did I wake her?

52:52.419 --> 52:53.503
No.

52:56.548 --> 52:57.632
Thank you.

53:04.055 --> 53:05.432
I have a wish.

53:06.266 --> 53:07.350
What is it?

53:07.934 --> 53:09.311
Do you want to dance with me?

53:10.103 --> 53:11.187
Dance?

53:11.313 --> 53:13.607
You said you'll do everything
I want to do.

53:16.318 --> 53:17.402
I've always wanted to

53:18.153 --> 53:21.448
dance to the blues with a man.

53:23.450 --> 53:25.035
There you go again with your tacky taste.

53:25.660 --> 53:26.745
Forget it, then.

53:27.704 --> 53:28.788
Fine.

53:29.497 --> 53:30.582
I'll do it.

53:32.584 --> 53:34.085
I can do that much.

53:49.100 --> 53:50.185
How's this song?

53:51.686 --> 53:52.771
Isn't it nice?

53:53.146 --> 53:54.230
It is.

54:04.824 --> 54:06.534
From now on,

54:07.160 --> 54:10.080
let's listen to music and dance every day.

54:15.293 --> 54:16.503
Sounds good.

54:17.712 --> 54:18.797
Good.

54:19.756 --> 54:20.840
Then,

54:22.926 --> 54:24.302
let's also sing,

54:25.345 --> 54:26.680
walk in the rain,

54:28.473 --> 54:29.766
and look at the flowers.

54:30.392 --> 54:31.810
That sounds good too.

54:33.061 --> 54:35.647
Let's go biking with Eun-seong,

54:35.730 --> 54:37.357
play soccer,

54:38.775 --> 54:40.151
and go to amusement parks.

54:41.486 --> 54:42.570
Sounds good.

54:45.907 --> 54:48.451
We'll do everything we want to

54:48.535 --> 54:50.578
every day from now on.

54:51.371 --> 54:53.289
We'll have so much fun.

54:54.874 --> 54:56.126
That's exactly what I want too.

54:58.878 --> 55:00.380
Everyone dies.

55:00.714 --> 55:02.298
Everyone will die at some point.

55:03.133 --> 55:06.428
So there is no reason to be sad

55:06.636 --> 55:08.555
or discouraged.

55:10.473 --> 55:13.226
The person who lives
a great life is the winner.

55:13.852 --> 55:14.936
Exactly.

55:16.187 --> 55:18.481
Throw anything at me. I can handle it all.

55:18.898 --> 55:20.358
I have

55:21.067 --> 55:22.819
Eun-seong

55:23.528 --> 55:24.988
and you.

55:26.948 --> 55:28.033
That's right.

55:38.460 --> 55:39.669
Promise not to cry.

55:41.546 --> 55:42.672
From now on,

55:43.465 --> 55:44.883
no more crying.

55:45.467 --> 55:46.676
Only laughter.

55:59.522 --> 56:00.607
Come on.

56:01.649 --> 56:02.734
You wanted to dance,

56:03.026 --> 56:04.319
but you're terrible at it.

56:05.653 --> 56:06.738
Gosh.

56:07.155 --> 56:09.574
I don't have that much experience
with dating.

56:09.699 --> 56:10.909
I've been too busy with life.

56:12.786 --> 56:14.162
I'll teach you.

56:15.246 --> 56:16.664
I have lots of experience with dancing.

56:19.084 --> 56:20.376
Great.

56:40.313 --> 56:41.397
Can I...

56:43.733 --> 56:45.068
touch

56:46.277 --> 56:47.362
your face?

56:49.739 --> 56:51.116
What are you doing?

56:52.158 --> 56:53.409
I'm expensive.

56:54.619 --> 56:55.787
You can't touch my face for free.

56:56.371 --> 56:58.414
Let me touch your face.

56:59.791 --> 57:03.128
I don't want to forget
my handsome husband's face.

57:11.553 --> 57:14.597
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

57:16.474 --> 57:18.685
You said you won't cry.

57:27.861 --> 57:28.945
By the way,

57:31.656 --> 57:34.284
can you tell me you love me?

57:35.994 --> 57:37.078
It makes me cringe.

57:38.455 --> 57:39.914
Do I have to say it for you to know?

57:40.832 --> 57:43.126
I want to hear it.

57:46.045 --> 57:47.172
Forget it.

57:47.839 --> 57:49.466
Ask someone else.

58:03.605 --> 58:04.898
Thank you.

58:07.942 --> 58:09.402
Honey.

59:16.219 --> 59:19.973
Onions and green peppers.

59:20.056 --> 59:21.140
-Tomatoes.
-Mom.

59:21.599 --> 59:23.726
And cheese.

59:25.270 --> 59:27.522
Once I spread the mayo...

59:27.605 --> 59:28.690
It's all done.

59:29.649 --> 59:30.733
-Mom.
-Yes?

59:30.817 --> 59:34.070
Are we really going
to an amusement park today?

59:34.153 --> 59:35.488
Of course.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.323
I'm so excited.

59:37.949 --> 59:40.451
We didn't get to play properly last time.

59:40.535 --> 59:42.537
You're right. Blame Dad for it.

59:47.542 --> 59:49.877
He doesn't deserve the sandwiches.
Let's not give him any.

59:51.379 --> 59:52.755
All right.

59:52.839 --> 59:54.257
Before we head out,

59:55.174 --> 59:56.301
let's dress up.

59:57.719 --> 59:58.803
Mom,

59:58.928 --> 1:00:01.806
can I put a little bit more?

1:00:01.973 --> 1:00:03.266
-Okay.
-Here.

1:00:03.558 --> 1:00:05.476
-This is for Mom.
-Oh, my.

1:00:05.852 --> 1:00:06.978
-This is for Mom.
-Eun-seong,

1:00:07.061 --> 1:00:08.146
how do I look?

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:09.981
You look awesome.

1:00:11.941 --> 1:00:12.942
How do I look?

1:00:13.026 --> 1:00:14.152
You look even better.

1:00:14.235 --> 1:00:15.903
Now for mine.

1:00:19.365 --> 1:00:21.159
I look good in anything

1:00:21.784 --> 1:00:22.869
all the time.

1:00:46.893 --> 1:00:48.603
If someone asks me

1:00:49.103 --> 1:00:52.106
when the happiest moment of my life was,

1:00:53.274 --> 1:00:54.942
my answer will always be the same.

1:00:56.569 --> 1:00:57.987
Right here, right now.

1:00:58.196 --> 1:00:59.155
This very moment.

1:01:07.205 --> 1:01:08.331
Here we go.

1:01:12.627 --> 1:01:13.711
How cute.

1:01:14.003 --> 1:01:16.297
-Oh, my gosh, he's so cute.
-So cute.

1:01:16.381 --> 1:01:19.133
Mom, the panda told me

1:01:19.217 --> 1:01:22.637
that he wants to come live

1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:24.138
with our kittens.

1:01:26.057 --> 1:01:27.266
Buy him for us.

1:01:27.684 --> 1:01:28.893
You can raise him, right?

1:01:42.407 --> 1:01:45.159
I don't know how much time we have left.

1:01:46.160 --> 1:01:47.662
It may be a year

1:01:47.954 --> 1:01:49.330
or a month.

1:01:49.997 --> 1:01:51.040
Or perhaps

1:01:51.124 --> 1:01:53.000
tomorrow might be our last day.

1:01:53.835 --> 1:01:57.296
But I won't have any more regrets.

1:02:07.890 --> 1:02:08.975
Therefore,

1:02:09.976 --> 1:02:12.437
there is only one thing
I can do right now.

1:02:24.115 --> 1:02:25.199
I love you, Hye-su.

1:02:29.495 --> 1:02:30.580
I love you.

1:02:31.122 --> 1:02:32.165
I love you.

1:02:33.082 --> 1:02:34.751
Every second of every day,

1:02:35.376 --> 1:02:36.461
I love you.

1:03:01.986 --> 1:03:04.071
