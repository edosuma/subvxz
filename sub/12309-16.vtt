WEBVTT

00:02.091 --> 00:03.759
You sure you don't want
to spend your leave

00:03.760 --> 00:05.227
Going back
to earth

00:05.228 --> 00:06.028
Like mckay
and the others?

00:06.029 --> 00:07.763
Nah, sgc
doesn't have a zpm,

00:07.764 --> 00:09.331
So two weeks on earth

00:09.332 --> 00:11.266
<i>Means three weeks
cooped up in the  daedalus.</i>

00:11.267 --> 00:12.367
That's five weeks
of missing work.

00:12.368 --> 00:14.636
We only get one of those
every year-and-a-half,

00:14.637 --> 00:16.738
So I'd like to save mine
for something more special.

00:16.739 --> 00:18.307
So we're going
camping instead?

00:18.308 --> 00:20.142
On a beach that's never
been surfed or even touched.

00:20.143 --> 00:20.609
You gotta get
more excited about this.

00:20.610 --> 00:23.245
Uh-huh.

00:23.246 --> 00:25.347
Hey, check that out.

00:25.348 --> 00:26.148
What?

00:26.149 --> 00:28.183
Think he'll ever
make a move?

00:28.184 --> 00:30.185
[both laughing]

00:30.186 --> 00:32.054
Who cares?

00:32.055 --> 00:34.022
Hmm.

00:34.023 --> 00:36.458
Say...

00:36.459 --> 00:39.561
I know we only get
14 days on earth a year,

00:39.562 --> 00:40.963
And you miss your dad
and all...

00:40.964 --> 00:43.598
But...

00:43.599 --> 00:44.700
See, one of my old--

00:44.701 --> 00:45.667
A guy
who was doing his doctorate

00:45.668 --> 00:48.070
At the same time as me,

00:48.071 --> 00:49.838
He's giving
a big secret presentation

00:49.839 --> 00:51.340
About some new thing
that he's working on,

00:51.341 --> 00:53.342
And everyone and anyone
in the physics community

00:53.343 --> 00:54.076
Is going to be there.

00:54.077 --> 00:56.244
And... Well...

00:56.245 --> 00:57.346
See, the thing is

00:57.347 --> 00:59.247
There's this perception
out there

00:59.248 --> 01:00.182
That I'm,

01:00.183 --> 01:01.984
Um...

01:01.985 --> 01:03.618
Like, a washout, recluse...

01:03.619 --> 01:04.553
Why?

01:04.554 --> 01:05.988
Well, 'cause I do this
for a living.

01:05.989 --> 01:08.156
I mean, super double
tip-top secret stuff.

01:08.157 --> 01:09.358
I mean, I haven't
published a paper

01:09.359 --> 01:10.759
In nearly a decade--

01:10.760 --> 01:11.960
Not one that can be read
by the general public--

01:11.961 --> 01:13.562
And I'm kind of hard
to get ahold of,

01:13.563 --> 01:14.963
What with living
in another galaxy and all.

01:14.964 --> 01:16.465
Yeah, I know what that's like.

01:16.466 --> 01:18.533
Exactly. They think
I'm a shut-in.

01:18.534 --> 01:20.235
So... I was thinking...

01:20.236 --> 01:24.106
That if I was to, say,
show up... With a woman...

01:24.107 --> 01:26.875
Uh-huh.

01:26.876 --> 01:28.510
A-- a beautiful woman...

01:28.511 --> 01:30.512
That they
wouldn't maybe--

01:30.513 --> 01:35.484
Not think that I was...
Like, a complete loser.

01:35.485 --> 01:36.318
Like, it would be
one day,

01:36.319 --> 01:38.120
The first night
we were there,

01:38.121 --> 01:40.289
And then you could be off
to chippewa falls.

01:40.290 --> 01:41.556
I mean, it could be fun.

01:41.557 --> 01:43.358
Hmm. Well, let's see--

01:43.359 --> 01:45.827
A room full of physicists,

01:45.828 --> 01:47.396
A long-winded
presentation

01:47.397 --> 01:48.964
I probably
won't understand...

01:48.965 --> 01:52.467
Yeah, doesn't really sound
like fun.

01:52.468 --> 01:53.769
Well, there'll be drinks,
probably,

01:53.770 --> 01:55.337
And maybe
those little sandwiches...

01:55.338 --> 01:56.872
And... Me.

01:56.873 --> 01:58.507
I'll be there.

01:58.508 --> 02:00.809
You don't have to fabricate
all these reasons

02:00.810 --> 02:02.978
On why you need me
to be with you.

02:02.979 --> 02:05.881
You could just ask me out
on a date.

02:05.882 --> 02:07.382
Hey, I didn't want to--

02:07.383 --> 02:08.616
I mean, I know you--

02:08.618 --> 02:09.584
I'll probably say yes.

02:11.954 --> 02:13.755
Well, you... Want to go
to this thing with me?

02:13.756 --> 02:15.657
Sure.

02:15.658 --> 02:17.926
I'd love to.

02:17.927 --> 02:19.962
Well, I'd love--
I mean, that's--

02:19.963 --> 02:21.396
Good. Good. Great. That's--

02:21.397 --> 02:22.698
It's a date.

02:22.699 --> 02:24.232
It's a date.

02:24.233 --> 02:25.600
So what's
the presentation?

02:25.601 --> 02:27.135
I don't know.

02:27.136 --> 02:28.737
He doesn't want to tell anyone
until we all get there,

02:28.738 --> 02:30.105
But if I know this guy,

02:30.106 --> 02:33.608
It'll be, uh, you know,
first-class presentation...

02:33.609 --> 02:35.711
With, like, second-rate science.

02:35.712 --> 02:36.611
Probably some minor adjustment
to someone else's work,

02:36.612 --> 02:39.815
But the food'll be good.

02:39.816 --> 02:41.883
And the company.

02:41.884 --> 02:45.620
[¶]

02:52.996 --> 02:54.830
Malcolm, have you
read this?

02:54.831 --> 02:56.331
Yes.

02:56.332 --> 02:57.599
Your staff thinks
it's reckless

02:57.600 --> 02:58.500
To turn this thing on
tomorrow.

02:58.501 --> 02:59.968
<i>Some of my staff...</i>

02:59.969 --> 03:01.803
Malcolm...

03:01.804 --> 03:04.740
They're just getting cold feet,
that's all.

03:04.741 --> 03:06.341
Do you remember
all that stuff that came out

03:06.342 --> 03:09.244
Before cern turned on the lhc?

03:09.245 --> 03:11.113
You know, miniature black holes,

03:11.114 --> 03:11.580
Exotic particles,

03:11.581 --> 03:13.615
Strangelets,

03:13.616 --> 03:15.717
The instantaneous destruction
of the planet?

03:15.718 --> 03:18.920
All unfounded histrionics.

03:18.921 --> 03:19.454
We are going to be just fine.

03:19.455 --> 03:21.990
So you're saying

03:21.991 --> 03:23.625
None of these potential
catastrophes will happen?

03:23.626 --> 03:27.162
Well, there is always
the slight possibility

03:27.163 --> 03:29.564
That something might go wrong.

03:29.565 --> 03:31.466
The cause
has a lot riding on this.

03:31.467 --> 03:32.501
Don't worry about it.

03:32.502 --> 03:33.669
Your precious "cause"

03:33.670 --> 03:35.804
Will come out of this
squeaky clean tomorrow.

03:35.805 --> 03:36.538
Some of these
worst-case scenarios

03:36.539 --> 03:37.873
Are terrifying--

03:37.874 --> 03:39.841
Of course they're terrifying--

03:39.842 --> 03:41.943
They're worst-case scenarios!

03:41.944 --> 03:43.178
They are
the worst possible thing

03:43.179 --> 03:45.113
That could ever happen,
ever.

03:45.114 --> 03:47.482
[sighs]

03:47.483 --> 03:49.551
Tomorrow will come off
without a hitch.

03:49.552 --> 03:51.386
We've done hundreds of tests.

03:51.387 --> 03:52.888
There is zero possibility
for failure.

03:55.124 --> 03:56.525
Trust me.

04:01.297 --> 04:03.732

04:18.817 --> 04:20.385
This is exciting.

04:20.386 --> 04:22.954
[chuckles]:
well, it's just a plane.

04:22.955 --> 04:24.489
Yeah, but I've never even flown
first class.

04:24.490 --> 04:25.657
This is amazing.

04:25.658 --> 04:26.157
Have you tried
these strawberries?

04:26.158 --> 04:27.725
When I was 10,

04:27.726 --> 04:28.793
I ate a bowl full
of strawberries

04:28.794 --> 04:29.961
And threw up.

04:29.962 --> 04:32.363
I haven't been able
to stomach them since.

04:32.364 --> 04:33.831
How does this guy
afford all this?

04:33.832 --> 04:35.533
I thought
he was just a physicist.

04:35.534 --> 04:36.568
Well, he was
always able

04:36.569 --> 04:38.336
To dupe guys
with deep pockets in

04:38.337 --> 04:40.104
To backing his research.

04:40.105 --> 04:41.239
It's amazing what a nice smile
and a power point presentation

04:41.240 --> 04:43.408
Will get you.

04:43.409 --> 04:44.409
Well, I am impressed.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.210
Yes,

04:46.211 --> 04:47.478
I can see that.

04:47.479 --> 04:49.147
Oh, come on.

04:49.148 --> 04:51.182
You should be happy
for your friend's success.

04:51.183 --> 04:52.584
Well, it's more
of an acquaintance

04:52.585 --> 04:54.085
Than a friend.

04:54.086 --> 04:56.154
Acquaintances don't pick you up
in private planes.

04:56.155 --> 04:57.922
He didn't send the jet
to be nice.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.724
He sent the jet
to rub it in my face.

04:59.725 --> 05:01.125
I was always one step
ahead of this guy

05:01.126 --> 05:02.994
During school,

05:02.995 --> 05:04.062
And now that we're
in the "real world,"

05:04.063 --> 05:05.230
He wants to show me that,

05:05.231 --> 05:06.598
As far as most of the planet
is concerned,

05:06.599 --> 05:08.533
He's a lot more successful
than I am.

05:08.534 --> 05:10.902
And what is with
the evening attire?

05:10.903 --> 05:12.704
I mean, we're going to
a science talk, for god's sake.

05:12.705 --> 05:14.138
Who the hell
does he think he is?

05:14.139 --> 05:15.940
Is this what the whole day
will be like?

05:15.941 --> 05:16.674
Are you going to be
in a bad mood?

05:17.142 --> 05:19.711
No.

05:19.712 --> 05:21.379
'cause we're back on earth
on a private jet,

05:21.380 --> 05:23.281
Drinking expensive champagne,

05:23.282 --> 05:25.883
And your date's wearing
a fancy dress.

05:25.884 --> 05:28.886
Most people would be having
a good time, rodney.

05:28.887 --> 05:30.421
You're right. You're right...

05:33.025 --> 05:34.359
Hmm.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.211
Mckay.

05:53.212 --> 05:55.146
Dr. Rodney mckay.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.714
Dr. Jennifer keller.

05:56.715 --> 05:57.382
Yes. Welcome.

05:57.383 --> 05:59.450
I'll just need you both

05:59.451 --> 06:02.654
To sign this non-disclosure
and confidentiality agreement.

06:02.655 --> 06:04.956
You're not serious.

06:04.957 --> 06:06.324
Is there a problem, sir?

06:06.325 --> 06:08.793
This whole thing
is a confidentiality agreement?

06:08.794 --> 06:10.261
Yes, sir.

06:10.262 --> 06:11.529
What could they possibly
be doing back there

06:11.530 --> 06:12.964
That needs to be kept
200 pages secret?

06:12.965 --> 06:16.000
If you want to go inside, sir,
you need to sign the agreement.

06:18.270 --> 06:19.737
Dinosaurs?

06:19.738 --> 06:22.073
Excuse me?

06:22.074 --> 06:23.441
Do they have living dinosaurs
back there?

06:23.442 --> 06:24.709
Because I'll sign this

06:24.710 --> 06:25.944
If he's brought dinosaurs
back to life.

06:25.945 --> 06:27.812
But short of that,
he is out of his mind

06:27.813 --> 06:28.913
If he thinks
that I am going to pretend

06:28.914 --> 06:29.914
That whatever discovery
he's made

06:29.915 --> 06:31.316
Is so important
and so secret

06:31.317 --> 06:33.284
That I have to sign
the unabridged works

06:33.285 --> 06:34.619
Of william shakespeare here.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.921
Just sign it.

06:36.922 --> 06:39.090
Here you go.

06:39.091 --> 06:42.026
Oh. You're just lucky
the lady's here, aren't you?

06:44.129 --> 06:45.863
[¶]

06:59.311 --> 07:01.312
Where do you think
we are?

07:01.313 --> 07:03.181
I don't know.
Arizona? Nevada?

07:03.182 --> 07:04.515
I didn't think

07:04.516 --> 07:05.316
People even built
secret facilities anymore.

07:05.317 --> 07:08.586
It seems so 1950s.

07:08.587 --> 07:11.522
Rodney mckay?

07:11.523 --> 07:13.091
I had it on good authority
that you were dead.

07:13.092 --> 07:15.627
Oh, ha ha.

07:15.628 --> 07:17.428
And this would be
your... Sister?

07:17.429 --> 07:19.230
No, no, neil.
She's not my sister.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.399
This is jennifer keller.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.469
That's bill nye
and neil degrasse tyson.

07:24.470 --> 07:26.271
You know, from television.

07:26.972 --> 07:28.806
Yeah, uh-- of course.

07:28.807 --> 07:31.075
Very nice to meet you.

07:31.076 --> 07:31.776
No, pleasure's mine.

07:31.777 --> 07:33.177
And she's
taken, neil.

07:33.178 --> 07:35.046
No, no, I didn't
mean it that way--

07:35.047 --> 07:36.180
Neil likes to steal
things from me,

07:36.181 --> 07:38.383
Things like women and
theoretical physics ideas.

07:38.384 --> 07:40.318
Yeah, but who hasn't
stolen an idea

07:40.319 --> 07:42.587
From the great
rodney mckay?

07:42.588 --> 07:44.022
Oh, so we
admit it now.

07:44.023 --> 07:45.356
See, back in the day,

07:45.357 --> 07:46.858
Whenever any one of these people
came up with a new idea

07:46.859 --> 07:48.359
Or published a new paper,

07:48.360 --> 07:50.662
Dr. Mckay here would swear

07:50.663 --> 07:52.664
That he was already working
on something very similar,

07:52.665 --> 07:53.898
Just hadn't gotten around
to publishing it yet.

07:53.899 --> 07:55.600
He'd say
things like,

07:55.601 --> 07:56.434
"I was about to say
that very same thing,"

07:56.435 --> 07:58.836
Or, "I was just about to have

07:58.837 --> 08:00.738
That same idea."

08:00.739 --> 08:02.273
At least I didn't declassify
pluto from planet status.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.042
Way to make all
the little kids cry, neil.

08:04.043 --> 08:04.943
That make you feel
like a big man?

08:04.944 --> 08:07.412
See, thanks to dr. Tyson,

08:07.413 --> 08:09.414
Pluto is now the first
of the plutoids,

08:09.415 --> 08:09.981
A new class
of celestial object.

08:09.982 --> 08:11.749
It's cool.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.251
Come on, rodney.

08:13.252 --> 08:14.752
It's the 21st century.

08:14.753 --> 08:16.187
Actually, come
to think of it,

08:16.188 --> 08:16.821
When was the last time
you even published a paper?

08:16.822 --> 08:19.057
The '80s?

08:19.058 --> 08:19.958
It hasn't been that long.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.292
I think
I was listening

08:21.293 --> 08:21.960
<i>To that band
a flock of seagulls</i>

08:21.961 --> 08:24.295
While I was reading it.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.664
Actually, it might
have been pre-reagan.

08:26.665 --> 08:28.233
Well, it has been great
running into you guys.

08:28.234 --> 08:30.268
We should maybe
get our seats.

08:30.269 --> 08:30.335
Bye.

08:32.171 --> 08:34.472
[whistles]

08:34.472 --> 08:36.341
They can't possibly be dating.

08:36.342 --> 08:37.075
I know.

08:37.076 --> 08:38.509
Well, you're married, so...

08:38.510 --> 08:40.645
Dibs.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.578
She's all yours.

08:46.085 --> 08:47.752
I think maybe this
was a bad idea.

08:47.753 --> 08:49.988
Why?

08:49.989 --> 08:51.022
Well, I just
remembered

08:51.023 --> 08:53.992
I don't really like
these people.

08:53.993 --> 08:55.927
Is it that
you don't like them,

08:55.928 --> 08:57.528
Or maybe they
don't like you?

08:57.529 --> 08:59.664
Possibly.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.800
I mean, I used to be
a little... Abrasive?

09:02.801 --> 09:04.636
Oh, used to be. Yeah.

09:04.637 --> 09:05.870
It's hard to explain.

09:05.871 --> 09:08.573
My field is
very competitive.

09:08.574 --> 09:09.073
Yeah, I went
to med school

09:09.074 --> 09:10.575
For six years.

09:10.576 --> 09:13.044
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

09:13.045 --> 09:14.545
Oh... Right.

09:14.546 --> 09:15.413
Not everything

09:15.414 --> 09:16.714
Has to be
a competition, rodney.

09:16.715 --> 09:17.382
They know
how smart you are.

09:17.383 --> 09:19.250
I'm not sure they do.

09:19.251 --> 09:20.485
Of course they do.

09:20.486 --> 09:21.619
You don't have to
keep reminding them.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.588
It's called being humble.

09:23.589 --> 09:27.091
Have you heard
that word before?

09:27.092 --> 09:28.893
Look, we're on our first date

09:28.894 --> 09:31.195
And I've come
to a physics talk, okay?

09:31.196 --> 09:32.697
You have to bend
a little bit too.

09:32.698 --> 09:35.199
Humble, eh?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.268
I'll guess
I can try anything once.

10:28.220 --> 10:29.320
Hello. I'm malcolm tunney.

10:31.290 --> 10:32.991
If he's so worried
about global warming,

10:32.992 --> 10:34.592
Why did he fly us here
on a private jet

10:34.593 --> 10:36.527
That spews out
more co2 than sweden?

10:36.528 --> 10:38.863
Shh.

10:38.864 --> 10:40.498
Thank you very much.

10:40.499 --> 10:41.966
Very kind.

10:41.967 --> 10:43.234
As many of you know,

10:43.235 --> 10:44.802
I am not an environmental
scientist,

10:44.803 --> 10:47.238
Nor do I pretend to be one.

10:47.239 --> 10:49.407
For instance,
I shower regularly.

10:52.378 --> 10:53.378
No offense, larry.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.615
I'm just a concerned citizen,

10:57.616 --> 11:00.852
One who realizes that the earth
has carried us for so long,

11:00.853 --> 11:03.955
Maybe it's time
that we carried her.

11:03.956 --> 11:04.856
That ratio
would be accurate

11:04.857 --> 11:06.157
If his body was
the size of his ego.

11:06.158 --> 11:08.593
Yeah,
it's a little much.

11:08.594 --> 11:10.695
Solving a problem
like global warming

11:10.696 --> 11:13.398
May seem impossibly complex.

11:13.399 --> 11:15.433
So many nations,
so many corporations,

11:15.434 --> 11:17.402
And john q. Public

11:17.403 --> 11:21.272
Will have to agree
on a dizzying number of issues.

11:21.273 --> 11:23.608
So, then,
what can one person really do

11:23.609 --> 11:24.342
To make a difference?

11:24.343 --> 11:26.177
What can I,

11:26.178 --> 11:28.580
With my particular and unique
skill set,

11:28.581 --> 11:30.214
Do to help?

11:30.215 --> 11:32.183
They think you're
the arrogant one?

11:32.184 --> 11:34.018
Hmmph.

11:34.019 --> 11:34.719
I've been working
on a number of projects

11:34.720 --> 11:36.487
Over the last decade,

11:36.488 --> 11:39.057
And I realized that,
if I were to combine them,

11:39.058 --> 11:42.860
I just may be able to achieve
something unexpected...

11:42.861 --> 11:44.662
So, ladies and gentlemen,

11:44.663 --> 11:45.630
With major funding

11:45.631 --> 11:48.866
From my friends
at kramer innovations,

11:48.867 --> 11:50.935
I have been able
to devise a means

11:50.936 --> 11:56.007
To cool our planet
in a safe and controlled way.

11:56.008 --> 11:58.843
This guy wouldn't
know cool--

11:58.844 --> 12:03.314
Now, the science behind this
is immensely complex,

12:03.315 --> 12:04.082
But there will be
detailed briefs

12:04.083 --> 12:05.683
Handed out to you

12:05.684 --> 12:06.384
As you leave
the lecture hall,

12:06.385 --> 12:07.652
But for right now,

12:07.653 --> 12:09.187
<i>Let me just give you
the  cliffs notes.</i>

12:09.188 --> 12:11.389
It begins
with a massive heat-sink,

12:11.390 --> 12:12.790
One of my own design,

12:12.791 --> 12:13.791
Which steadily draws heat

12:13.792 --> 12:15.460
From the surrounding
environment.

12:15.461 --> 12:16.694
[together]:
but where does the heat go?

12:16.695 --> 12:18.763
[malcolm]:
where does that heat go,

12:18.764 --> 12:19.964
You may ask.

12:19.965 --> 12:23.134
Well, my friends,
that is the hard part.

12:23.135 --> 12:28.907
I give you the tunney
space-time matter bridge.

12:28.908 --> 12:32.176
Wait. What?

12:32.177 --> 12:34.479
Now, this isn't just some
theoretical math proof.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.049
This is a functioning
piece of technology,

12:38.050 --> 12:40.919
One that literally moves heat
from our space time

12:40.920 --> 12:44.422
And vents it out
into another space time.

12:44.423 --> 12:46.024
That's my bridge...

12:46.025 --> 12:46.491
My sister and I
came up with that.

12:46.492 --> 12:47.792
Shh. Sorry.

12:47.793 --> 12:50.695
And it works.

12:50.696 --> 12:53.231
We've been testing the system
for a few months now,

12:53.232 --> 12:55.500
And it has proved to be
remarkably stable.

12:55.501 --> 12:57.435
That's my idea!

12:57.436 --> 12:59.203
[whispering]: rodney,
now is not the time.

12:59.204 --> 13:01.205
For the purposes
of the demonstration today,

13:01.206 --> 13:02.340
I've surrounded this facility

13:02.341 --> 13:04.075
With an electrified
plasma grid

13:04.076 --> 13:06.744
That will contain
the reach of the heat-sink.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.414
It will draw heat
only from this facility.

13:09.415 --> 13:10.882
Wait, he's going
to turn it on

13:10.883 --> 13:11.916
With us here.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.184
That's-- this
is a bad idea.

13:13.185 --> 13:14.285
Rodney, please.

13:14.286 --> 13:15.820
And to prove the effectiveness
of this system,

13:15.821 --> 13:18.957
I will lower the temperature
within this facility

13:18.958 --> 13:20.191
By 10 degrees.

13:20.192 --> 13:21.226
Oh, and don't worry,

13:21.227 --> 13:22.694
I've turned off
the air conditioning,

13:22.695 --> 13:24.429
So there'll be no cheating,
I promise.

13:24.430 --> 13:24.896
I'm sorry, I can't
let him do this--

13:24.897 --> 13:25.463
No, rodney--

13:25.464 --> 13:26.931
Excuse me!

13:26.932 --> 13:27.498
Malcolm...

13:27.499 --> 13:29.867
Dr. Mckay.

13:29.868 --> 13:31.769
Thank you
for coming.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.471
This is a bad idea.

13:33.472 --> 13:36.608
Well, we're not quite ready
for the q&a session yet,

13:36.609 --> 13:38.576
So if you could just wait
till then--

13:38.577 --> 13:40.645
Let's just take a look
at the data you've come up with

13:40.646 --> 13:42.547
And talk about this,

13:42.548 --> 13:44.882
Because turning the device on
with all these people here

13:44.883 --> 13:46.284
Could be very dangerous.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.853
Respectfully, I disagree.

13:48.854 --> 13:50.688
Wh-- you can't do
something like this

13:50.689 --> 13:51.222
Without our consent.

13:51.223 --> 13:53.958
[man]: sit down!

13:53.959 --> 13:55.860
You did sign the document
when you entered, didn't you?

13:55.861 --> 13:57.729
Well, yeah,
I thought that was just--

13:57.730 --> 13:58.997
Then I have your consent.

13:58.998 --> 14:00.899
Yeah, but--

14:00.900 --> 14:02.166
Look, I've been doing work

14:02.167 --> 14:02.934
That is very, very similar
to this--

14:02.935 --> 14:04.569
Really?

14:04.570 --> 14:05.303
I don't think
that's possible.

14:05.304 --> 14:07.338
[people whispering]

14:07.339 --> 14:09.040
Look, these bridges
to other space times

14:09.041 --> 14:10.008
Can be very unpredictable.

14:10.009 --> 14:11.943
Do you have any research

14:11.944 --> 14:12.710
You'd like to put forward
right now?

14:12.711 --> 14:14.345
A paper, perhaps?

14:14.346 --> 14:15.480
Anything
to back up your claim?

14:18.484 --> 14:20.318
Rodney, please.

14:20.319 --> 14:22.487
Tell me this isn't
just petty jealously.

14:22.488 --> 14:24.022
Okay.

14:24.023 --> 14:25.957
Well, no, no, I--
I just--

14:25.958 --> 14:29.027
No, I didn't think so.

14:29.028 --> 14:29.894
Don't worry, everyone.

14:29.895 --> 14:30.795
This is completely safe.

14:30.796 --> 14:33.698
And...

14:33.699 --> 14:35.266

14:44.476 --> 14:45.810
Now, I'll be happy
to answer all of your questions

14:45.811 --> 14:47.745
Once you've had a chance
to read the brief,

14:47.746 --> 14:48.980
But for now,

14:48.981 --> 14:50.214
Why don't we all go
back out to the lobby

Where hot cocoa
is waiting,

14:52.551 --> 14:55.119

very cold in here.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.588
Thank you.

14:56.589 --> 14:57.422

14:58.958 --> 15:00.325
Let's go get some
hot chocolate, okay?

15:09.268 --> 15:10.568
This is...

15:10.569 --> 15:12.503
How did he even get ahold
of my work?

15:12.504 --> 15:13.638
You're sure
this is your work?

15:13.639 --> 15:14.906
Absolutely.

15:14.907 --> 15:16.207
Look, you believe me,
don't you?

15:16.208 --> 15:17.208
Of course I do.

15:17.209 --> 15:18.309
There is no way that
he came up with this

15:18.310 --> 15:20.211

We... Come on.

15:34.526 --> 15:37.562
We shouldn't
be in here.

15:37.563 --> 15:38.463
Okay, just
stand guard there.

15:38.464 --> 15:40.398
It'll take me
a couple of seconds

15:40.399 --> 15:40.999
To hack
into his computer.

15:52.077 --> 15:53.745
Thank you.

15:53.746 --> 15:55.480

but I don't think

15:55.481 --> 15:57.048
An achievement
of this magnitude

15:57.049 --> 15:59.083
Can truly be credited
to one man.

15:59.084 --> 15:59.717
Dr. Tunney, sir.

15:59.718 --> 16:01.552
Oh, excuse me.

16:01.553 --> 16:04.055
Yes? What is it?

16:04.056 --> 16:05.590
Well, you told us
to shut the device down

16:05.591 --> 16:07.091
Once we reached 64.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.160
Yes, that's right.
We can shut it down now.

16:09.161 --> 16:10.895
Well, that's the problem, sir.
We've tried.

16:10.896 --> 16:11.729
We've tried everything,
in fact.

16:11.730 --> 16:13.264
The device won't shut off.

16:24.143 --> 16:24.676
Y, could you just
we've tried everything,
give me a moment here?

16:24.677 --> 16:26.077
Let me in here.

16:26.078 --> 16:28.446
[keyboards clacking]

16:28.447 --> 16:29.480
All right, now,
who's been in here?

16:29.481 --> 16:30.915
Just us, sir.

16:30.916 --> 16:32.216
What is it?

16:32.217 --> 16:33.651
Well, the bridge
won't deactivate.

16:33.652 --> 16:35.019
I don't understand
why it shouldn't.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.921
Shut down the power
to the facility.

16:36.922 --> 16:38.456
Uh, that won't do anything.

16:38.457 --> 16:40.124
The system self-generates
its own power

16:40.125 --> 16:41.993
Once it's up and running.

16:41.994 --> 16:42.994
Then shut down
the containment field.

16:42.995 --> 16:44.062
We need to get these
guests out of here.

16:44.063 --> 16:45.363
That won't work
either.

16:45.364 --> 16:47.365
Why not?

16:47.366 --> 16:48.266
Why not?

16:48.267 --> 16:49.367
Well, it's
impossibly complicated,

16:49.368 --> 16:50.468
But the containment field

16:50.469 --> 16:50.935
Is tied
into the basic operations

16:50.936 --> 16:52.670
Of the device.

16:52.671 --> 16:54.372
It literally
can't shut down

16:54.373 --> 16:55.940
Until we collapse
the matter bridge.

16:55.941 --> 16:57.642
It's a safety protocol,

16:57.643 --> 16:58.710
One that I can't reprogram

16:58.711 --> 17:00.245
Until we can power down
the device.

17:00.246 --> 17:01.312
So we're trapped in here

17:01.313 --> 17:02.013
Until you can
get this thing fixed?

17:02.014 --> 17:03.748
Yes.

17:03.749 --> 17:04.949
What happens until then?

17:04.950 --> 17:06.617
The bridge
will continue to draw heat

17:06.618 --> 17:09.020
From the heat-sink.

17:09.021 --> 17:11.489
We just dropped 10 degrees
in 10 minutes.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.290
In an hour,
we'll be below zero.

17:13.291 --> 17:15.026
We're going to freeze to death.

17:15.027 --> 17:16.761
Well, I've activated
the facility's heating system.

17:16.762 --> 17:18.329
That should buy us
a little bit of time.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.765
You said "without a hitch,"
you'd run hundreds of tests.

17:20.766 --> 17:21.965
Someone has messed
with the system.

17:26.739 --> 17:27.771
That was
out of line, man.

17:27.772 --> 17:29.507
He stole the work.

17:29.508 --> 17:30.508
Hey, come on.

17:30.509 --> 17:31.709
It was in the middle
of his presentation.

17:31.710 --> 17:33.244
He was about
to start the thing up!

17:33.245 --> 17:34.679
It couldn't wait.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.614
He brought you here
as an olive branch.

17:36.615 --> 17:37.248
He wanted to
bury the hatchet.

17:37.249 --> 17:39.017
Yeah, in my back.

17:39.018 --> 17:40.785
Dr. Mckay? Dr. Keller?

17:40.786 --> 17:42.620
[both]: yes?

17:42.621 --> 17:45.623
Mr. Tunney would like a word.

17:45.624 --> 17:46.824
Uh-huh.

17:46.825 --> 17:51.629
Well, I'm guessing that
that word is "I apologize."

17:51.630 --> 17:53.097
That's, uh,
two words, genius.

17:57.703 --> 18:00.204
That's one odd duck, that guy.

18:00.739 --> 18:02.840
[door opens]

18:03.242 --> 18:06.044
Ah.

18:06.045 --> 18:09.681
Well, it takes a big man
to admit that he's wrong,

18:09.682 --> 18:11.015
And much as I appreciate it,

18:11.016 --> 18:12.216
I really would prefer
that this whole apology thing

18:12.217 --> 18:13.585
Took place
a little more publicly.

18:13.586 --> 18:15.219
Are you kidding?

18:15.220 --> 18:16.287
You are the one

18:16.288 --> 18:18.423
Who should be apologizing
to me.

18:18.424 --> 18:20.858
What the hell for?

18:20.859 --> 18:22.760
I invited you here
as a courtesy.

18:22.761 --> 18:24.295
Out of kindness.

18:24.296 --> 18:25.129
You know,
most people think

18:25.130 --> 18:26.497
You've lost
your mind,

18:26.498 --> 18:28.866
That you've gone, uh,
howard hughes.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.068
Just because
I don't call anymore

18:30.069 --> 18:31.970
Doesn't mean
I'm keeping my urine in jars.

18:31.971 --> 18:32.904
Look, I don't need you to--

18:32.905 --> 18:33.871
Shut up. I don't
have time for this.

18:33.872 --> 18:35.106
What have you two done?

18:35.107 --> 18:37.375
What have we done?

18:37.376 --> 18:39.210
We can't shut the device down.

18:39.211 --> 18:41.479
I told you not
to turn it on.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.680
I practically begged you.

18:42.681 --> 18:43.348
But would you listen? No!

18:43.349 --> 18:45.516
Tell us
what you did

18:45.517 --> 18:46.918
And how to undo it

18:46.919 --> 18:48.820
And I'll consider
not pressing charges.

18:48.821 --> 18:50.455
We didn't do
anything.

18:50.456 --> 18:51.556
Oh, really?

18:51.557 --> 18:53.157
Explain this, then.

19:01.333 --> 19:01.966
<i>We shouldn't
be in here.</i>

19:01.967 --> 19:03.902
<i>Stand guard there.</i>

19:03.903 --> 19:06.237
<i>It'll take me a couple seconds
to hack into his computer.</i>

19:06.238 --> 19:07.839
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

19:07.840 --> 19:09.707
<i>If that son of a bitch thinks
that he can humiliate me</i>

19:09.708 --> 19:10.875
<i>In front of my peers
and get away with it,</i>

19:10.876 --> 19:11.676
<i>He's got
another thing coming.</i>

19:11.677 --> 19:13.111
<i>I will destroy him.</i>

19:13.112 --> 19:14.779
<i>Now is not
the time, rodney.</i>

19:14.780 --> 19:15.880
<i>Got to be something in here
I can use</i>

19:15.881 --> 19:17.515
<i>To discredit
the pretentious tool.</i>

19:17.516 --> 19:19.384
<i>Hurry up, hurry up,
somebody's coming.</i>

19:19.385 --> 19:20.585
<i>Come on, come on,
come on.</i>

19:23.656 --> 19:26.791
Now, look, I can see how,
out of context,

19:26.792 --> 19:28.826
That could seem
incriminating...

19:28.827 --> 19:30.361
Out of context?

19:30.362 --> 19:30.929
What were you
doing in there?

19:32.765 --> 19:34.999
I was looking
for a paper I published

19:35.000 --> 19:36.668
A little over two years ago,

19:36.669 --> 19:38.336
One that dealt with
a matter bridge.

19:38.337 --> 19:39.704
Rodney,

19:39.705 --> 19:43.441
You have not published a paper
in a very long time.

19:43.442 --> 19:45.043
You probably didn't even know
it was my work.

19:45.044 --> 19:47.211
<i>Oh, you're publishing
under a  nom de plume  now?</i>

19:47.212 --> 19:50.782
Okay, here's how I think
it went down--

19:50.783 --> 19:51.950
You were working
with the government.

19:51.951 --> 19:54.152
Someone there trusted you a lot

19:54.153 --> 19:55.620
And let you see something
you weren't supposed to see.

19:55.621 --> 19:58.690
Or maybe you were sent something
by accident, who knows.

19:58.691 --> 20:00.792
You saw a paper
about a matter bridge,

20:00.793 --> 20:02.927
A project
that was shut down

20:02.928 --> 20:05.363
Due to the adverse effects
of exotic particles.

20:05.364 --> 20:07.198
You read it,

20:07.199 --> 20:08.499
You realized
that if the bridge was used

20:08.500 --> 20:11.135
Merely as a transfer of energy,
say heat,

20:11.136 --> 20:12.237
There would be
no exotic particle creation

20:12.238 --> 20:14.205
And thus
no adverse effects.

20:14.206 --> 20:15.940
So...

20:15.941 --> 20:17.475
You co-opted the science
as your own,

20:17.476 --> 20:19.377
Made a few changes
to make yourself feel better,

20:19.378 --> 20:20.712
And got to work,

20:20.713 --> 20:22.447
Dismissing
the original authors' warnings

20:22.448 --> 20:23.681
About the inherent instability

20:23.682 --> 20:26.150
Of time-space bridges.

20:26.151 --> 20:26.751
How am I doing so far?

20:26.752 --> 20:28.319
That's preposterous.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.622
Dr. Tunney's
been working on this for years.

20:30.623 --> 20:34.058
That was my work, malcolm.

20:34.059 --> 20:34.959
I wrote that paper.

20:39.565 --> 20:41.299
Terrence,

20:41.300 --> 20:44.102
These people
may be able to help us.

20:47.573 --> 20:48.106
[sighs]

20:48.107 --> 20:49.607
This is bad.

20:49.608 --> 20:51.175
The sabotage?

20:51.176 --> 20:53.077
Sabotage. Please.

20:53.078 --> 20:54.312
But you said there was--

20:54.313 --> 20:55.246
I may have rushed
to judgment.

20:55.247 --> 20:57.382
Can you shut it down?

20:57.383 --> 20:58.850
Look, these
matter bridges

20:58.851 --> 21:01.019
Are the very definition
of unpredictable.

21:01.020 --> 21:01.819
You know,
I think I remember you saying

21:01.820 --> 21:03.988
Something about that before.

21:03.989 --> 21:05.456
Yes or no, doctor?

21:05.457 --> 21:07.025
I don't know yet.

21:07.026 --> 21:07.358
Have you turned up the heat?

21:07.359 --> 21:08.793
Yes.

21:08.794 --> 21:09.127
Have you noticed this?

21:09.128 --> 21:11.462
Yes.

21:11.463 --> 21:13.064
What is it?

21:13.065 --> 21:13.798
The bridge isn't drawing
a consistent load

21:13.799 --> 21:15.567
From the heat-sink.

21:15.568 --> 21:17.368
Instead, it's wavering.

21:17.369 --> 21:18.770
Why is that bad?

21:18.771 --> 21:20.038
I wouldn't necessarily
call it bad.

21:20.039 --> 21:21.272
It's definitely not good,

21:21.273 --> 21:22.707
But I don't know
that I'd call it bad.

21:22.708 --> 21:24.142
You're kidding me, right?

21:24.143 --> 21:25.543
A regular bridge

21:25.544 --> 21:26.110
Should draw
the same amount of energy

21:26.111 --> 21:27.812
At all times.

21:27.813 --> 21:29.480
This one
is fluctuating greatly.

21:29.481 --> 21:31.215
Maybe we can use that...

21:31.216 --> 21:32.951
Wait for it
to peak,

21:32.952 --> 21:34.385
Then overload it and crash.

21:34.386 --> 21:35.954
That's a good idea.

21:35.955 --> 21:37.188
Yeah, I thought
you'd like it...

21:37.189 --> 21:39.357
What with it being my idea
and all.

21:39.358 --> 21:40.191
[keyboard clacking]

21:42.461 --> 21:44.596
It's freezing in here.

21:44.597 --> 21:45.930
We get it.
It works.

21:45.931 --> 21:47.532
Shut it down.

21:47.533 --> 21:49.200
I'm starting to freeze
to my chair.

21:56.008 --> 21:57.642
What the hell was that?

22:02.748 --> 22:04.749
A sudden and dramatic
cooling beam.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.751
The irregular power pull
from the bridge...

22:06.752 --> 22:07.785
Oh, so when the bridge

22:07.786 --> 22:08.920
Makes a sudden demand
on the heat-sink...

22:08.921 --> 22:10.521
The heat-sink reacts

22:10.522 --> 22:12.090
By drawing power
from a single, localized place

22:12.091 --> 22:13.591
Inside the containment field.

22:13.592 --> 22:14.392
And that beam would freeze
anything in its path.

22:14.393 --> 22:16.060
Oh, did not see
this coming.

22:16.061 --> 22:17.762
It's freeze lightning.

22:17.763 --> 22:19.597
Freeze lightning...
Ooh, I like that.

22:19.598 --> 22:20.365
Oh, you can't have it.
It's mine.

22:20.366 --> 22:21.199
It's copywritten.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.402
How's he doing?

22:24.403 --> 22:26.838
He's in
very bad shape.

22:26.839 --> 22:29.974
It's like his whole left side
has been flash-frozen.

22:29.975 --> 22:32.010
I have never seen
anything like this before.

22:32.011 --> 22:32.977
Oh...

22:32.978 --> 22:34.479
Oh, man.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.315
Look, this isn't entirely
your fault.

22:37.316 --> 22:40.218
I... I really hope
he signed his waiver.

22:43.789 --> 22:45.223
Do you think
this is the first time

22:45.224 --> 22:46.591
This has happened?

22:46.592 --> 22:47.625
Yeah, or maybe
just the first time

22:47.626 --> 22:49.260
Anyone's been around
to notice it.

22:49.261 --> 22:51.095
So this thing could be wreaking
havoc all over the facility.

22:51.096 --> 22:53.197
So this is going
to keep happening?

22:53.198 --> 22:54.899
Yes, and probably
with greater frequency.

22:54.900 --> 22:55.800
Okay, this little side effect

22:55.801 --> 22:57.602
Is going to really hamper

22:57.603 --> 22:58.136
Our attempts
to shut this thing down.

22:58.137 --> 23:00.038
And by "hamper",

23:00.039 --> 23:01.406
You mean
"get us all killed."

23:01.407 --> 23:02.740
Yeah,

23:02.741 --> 23:04.008
Something like that.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.480
Need to call in
the military.   Yeah,

23:09.481 --> 23:11.182
I'd prefer not to
do that just yet.

23:11.183 --> 23:12.884
You're lucky that guy
out there isn't dead.

23:12.885 --> 23:15.019
I'm sure these two

23:15.020 --> 23:17.622
Can get the device back into
its proper operating mode.

23:17.623 --> 23:18.957
[mckay]: it's a little
late for that.

23:18.958 --> 23:20.592
Terrence,
things have gotten out of hand.

23:20.593 --> 23:22.160
We need to make that call.

23:22.161 --> 23:24.095
We make that call,
the government shuts us down.

23:24.096 --> 23:24.762
Yeah, that's the idea.

23:24.763 --> 23:26.064
I don't understand.

23:26.065 --> 23:27.131
When the device
started to malfunction,

23:27.132 --> 23:28.466
The first thing
you wanted to do

23:28.467 --> 23:30.635
Was get everyone out of here
safely.

23:30.636 --> 23:31.936
To avoid the project
being branded

23:31.937 --> 23:34.372
As too dangerous
to move forward.

23:34.373 --> 23:36.541
Well, the cat's
out of the bag now.

23:36.542 --> 23:37.542
Are you worried
about all the money

23:37.543 --> 23:39.110
You sunk into this?
'cause that's gone.

23:39.111 --> 23:40.578
No, I'm not worried
about the money.

23:40.579 --> 23:41.946
We're close
to coming up with a solution

23:41.947 --> 23:42.847
For global warming.

23:42.848 --> 23:45.583
We could save the planet.

23:45.584 --> 23:48.753
It's bigger than me,
and it's bigger than you.

23:48.754 --> 23:50.088
If we can get the device
under control

23:50.089 --> 23:51.189
Without calling the military,

23:51.190 --> 23:53.591
They're going to let us
continue our research.

23:53.592 --> 23:54.225
I've got news
for you.

23:54.226 --> 23:55.894
You can't control it,

23:55.895 --> 23:57.795
And you shouldn't continue
with your research.

23:57.796 --> 23:59.297
[terrence]:
we'll figure it out.

23:59.298 --> 24:03.101
I have the utmost faith
in both of you.

24:03.102 --> 24:03.801
This is ridiculous.

24:03.802 --> 24:05.069
Give me your cell.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.371
It won't work,

24:06.372 --> 24:07.272
Not with the
containment field up.

24:07.273 --> 24:08.206
There's too much
interference.

24:08.207 --> 24:09.007
You have a land line
in your office.

24:13.913 --> 24:15.813
It's dead.

24:15.814 --> 24:18.049
Give me that.

24:18.050 --> 24:18.449
It's dead.

24:18.450 --> 24:20.418
Mm-hmm.

24:20.419 --> 24:21.986
Kramer
must have killed the phones.

24:21.987 --> 24:22.754
I don't suppose
you have access

24:22.755 --> 24:23.721
To the
communications room?

24:23.722 --> 24:24.289
It's a kramer
facility.

24:24.290 --> 24:25.857
I just work here.

24:25.858 --> 24:26.758
Great.

24:26.759 --> 24:28.459
Looks like it's
up to you and me.

24:28.460 --> 24:29.661
We'd better get back
to the control room,

24:29.662 --> 24:30.261
Figure this out
ourselves.

24:30.262 --> 24:31.896
Wait.
Wait, wait.

24:31.897 --> 24:32.897
Isn't there, like,

24:32.898 --> 24:34.866
A room full of geniuses
out there?

24:34.867 --> 24:37.268
[together, snickering]:
that's debatable.

24:37.269 --> 24:39.103
If that freeze lightning thing
happens again,

24:39.104 --> 24:40.939
People could die.

24:40.940 --> 24:42.640
They'll slow me down.

24:42.641 --> 24:44.008
Hey! What happened
to that "humble" thing

24:44.009 --> 24:44.876
We were going to try
today?

24:48.681 --> 24:50.949
...The result

24:50.950 --> 24:53.551
Is what I am calling
"freeze lightning."

24:53.552 --> 24:54.719
[under breath]:
unbelievable.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.154
It is the sudden and
immediate transfer of heat

24:56.155 --> 24:57.855
From a localized area,

24:57.856 --> 24:59.924
And it is potentially
very lethal.

24:59.925 --> 25:02.493
We need to figure out how
to collapse the matter bridge,

25:02.494 --> 25:04.796
Stop it from drawing energy
from the heat-sink,

25:04.797 --> 25:08.633
Otherwise it's going to get
"unlivably" cold in here.

25:08.634 --> 25:09.300
Why don't we just turn
this containment field off

25:09.301 --> 25:11.302
And get out of here?

25:11.303 --> 25:12.170
Well, for one thing,

25:12.171 --> 25:13.104
It's tied into
the basic function

25:13.105 --> 25:13.905
Of the matter bridge,

25:13.906 --> 25:15.373
So we can't just
shut it off.

25:15.374 --> 25:17.175
[mckay]:
even if we could,

25:17.176 --> 25:18.810
It houses so much
cool air now

25:18.811 --> 25:20.378
That it would create a sudden,
massive cold front

25:20.379 --> 25:21.512
As soon as it drops.

25:21.513 --> 25:22.580
We're talking high-speed winds,
tornadoes...

25:22.581 --> 25:25.483
An instant mega-storm.

25:25.484 --> 25:27.285
[malcolm]: not
to mention the fact

25:27.286 --> 25:28.620
That the heat-sink
would start to draw heat

25:28.621 --> 25:29.387
Not just
from this facility,

25:29.388 --> 25:32.490
But from
the entire planet.

25:32.491 --> 25:35.493
We cannot allow that
to happen.

25:35.494 --> 25:37.495
Why don't we just destroy it,
just bash it apart?

25:37.496 --> 25:40.031
Because that could create
a tear in our space time.

25:40.032 --> 25:42.433
Never mind, then.

25:42.434 --> 25:43.034
Yeah.

25:45.504 --> 25:47.906
Look, you guys
are the best of the best.

25:47.907 --> 25:51.576
I'm sure if you work together,
you'll come up with something.

25:54.313 --> 25:57.515
[crowd of people arguing]

25:57.516 --> 25:59.350
That will never work. Look.

25:59.351 --> 26:00.718
Just give me
two seconds...

26:00.719 --> 26:02.887
No!

26:02.888 --> 26:05.290
You're going about this
all wrong.

26:05.291 --> 26:05.790
Watch who you're
correcting,

26:05.791 --> 26:07.292
"science guy."

26:07.293 --> 26:09.494
My ph.D.
Is not honorary.

26:09.495 --> 26:11.396
Hey, look, I'm an engineer.
I can do math!

26:11.397 --> 26:13.331
Just listen to my idea--

26:13.332 --> 26:14.832
I have been listening, and that
is what led me to believe

26:14.833 --> 26:16.568
That you are a moron!

26:16.569 --> 26:19.737
If it's any consolation,
you're both wrong.

26:19.738 --> 26:20.805
What, and you're right?

26:20.806 --> 26:22.006
[bill]: we're supposed
to listen to you?

26:22.007 --> 26:23.841
You're the jerk
that got us into this mess.

26:23.842 --> 26:25.643
[mckay]: I have
a workable theory.

26:25.644 --> 26:26.878
[malcolm]:
yeah, a "theory".

26:26.879 --> 26:28.546
Take into account that
I have experience with this,

26:28.547 --> 26:30.281
That I've been doing work
that is years ahead

26:30.282 --> 26:32.317
Of anything you guys have
even been dreaming about?

26:32.318 --> 26:34.819
I think that's kind of
what I'm getting at!

26:34.820 --> 26:35.853
Hey!

26:40.726 --> 26:41.526
This is embarrassing.

26:42.228 --> 26:44.829
Look at you--

26:44.830 --> 26:47.031
The greatest minds
this world has to offer,

26:47.032 --> 26:48.900
And if I didn't know
any better,

26:48.901 --> 26:51.603
I'd think there was a bunch
of sixth graders in here.

26:51.604 --> 26:54.806
You guys need to suck it up
and get along.

26:54.807 --> 26:56.474
It's like I've
always said,

26:56.475 --> 26:58.176
People are more alike
than they are different--

26:58.177 --> 26:59.510
Not now, nye.

26:59.511 --> 27:02.547
Okay.

27:02.548 --> 27:04.582
Our lives are at stake here.

27:04.583 --> 27:06.251
We need a solution,

27:06.252 --> 27:08.519
And we need this fast.

27:08.520 --> 27:11.089
Please...

27:11.090 --> 27:13.625
Come on, the rest of us
are counting on you.

27:16.262 --> 27:17.795
Yes, rodney.

27:17.796 --> 27:19.430
I think I'm onto something.

27:19.431 --> 27:21.366
It just needs
some ironing out.

27:21.367 --> 27:22.734
Okay. Great.

27:22.735 --> 27:23.968
Guys...

27:24.436 --> 27:26.504
Yeah, well,

27:26.505 --> 27:27.805
Let's have a look at it
and just...

27:27.806 --> 27:28.907
Fresh eyes.

27:28.908 --> 27:31.109
We'll start
with bill's theory...

27:31.110 --> 27:32.677
[quiet discussion]

27:39.184 --> 27:40.785
They'll figure
something out.

27:40.786 --> 27:43.354
I'm sure they will.

27:43.355 --> 27:46.157
Let's just hope
it's before someone dies.

27:50.362 --> 27:53.631
You know,
my uncle george,

27:53.632 --> 27:55.199
He always hated
the phrase

27:55.200 --> 27:57.168
"save the planet".

27:57.169 --> 27:59.170
What?

27:59.171 --> 28:00.972
Well, he just thought
it was a little backwards,

28:00.973 --> 28:02.707
You know, 'cause
the planet's going to be here

28:02.708 --> 28:04.442
No matter what happens.

28:04.443 --> 28:07.278
It might be
a giant unlivable rock,

28:07.279 --> 28:09.113
But it's going to survive.

28:09.114 --> 28:11.115
So you're
turning this

28:11.116 --> 28:12.917
Into a discussion
on semantics?

28:12.918 --> 28:15.486
What I mean is, mr. Kramer,

28:15.487 --> 28:18.856
The work you're doing
isn't about saving the planet.

28:18.857 --> 28:21.426
It's about saving lives.

28:21.427 --> 28:23.561
And that's
a noble pursuit,

28:23.562 --> 28:26.331
Trying to save
billions of people...

28:26.332 --> 28:30.134
But it's no less noble
to save a hundred.

28:30.135 --> 28:33.504
These guys, no matter
how smart they are,

28:33.505 --> 28:36.541
They could use some help.

28:36.542 --> 28:40.311
One phone call
could get that help here.

28:40.312 --> 28:41.179
Now, please...

28:43.983 --> 28:45.817
Please let me
make that call.

28:58.430 --> 29:01.132
Oh, don't tell me.

29:01.133 --> 29:03.368
[bangs door]

29:03.369 --> 29:04.903
[zapping, crackling]

29:04.904 --> 29:06.170
[under breath]: oh, god.

29:08.340 --> 29:10.875
Oh, I'm so sorry.

29:10.876 --> 29:13.044
Can you fix it?

29:13.045 --> 29:14.979
No. We're completely cut off.

29:21.987 --> 29:23.087
Well, that's terrible news.

29:23.088 --> 29:24.589
It's my fault.
I should have--

29:24.590 --> 29:25.223
Yeah, you should have.

29:25.224 --> 29:26.257
You need
to see this.

29:30.496 --> 29:32.597
Oh, the cold temperatures

29:32.598 --> 29:34.365
Are affecting
the containment field emitters.

29:34.366 --> 29:35.934
When they're weak,
they're on the verge of failing.

29:35.935 --> 29:37.201
That's great.

29:37.202 --> 29:37.735
We can get
most of the people

29:37.736 --> 29:38.903
Out of here, no?

29:38.904 --> 29:40.572
Make a call
to the military?

29:40.573 --> 29:42.240
We're surrounded
by desert air.

29:42.241 --> 29:43.007
The temperatures inside
the containment field

29:43.008 --> 29:43.975
Has gotten very,
very cold.

29:43.976 --> 29:45.910
Introducing a sudden

29:45.911 --> 29:47.278
And immediate blast
of icy air

29:47.279 --> 29:48.947
Will create one hell
of a vortex storm.

29:48.948 --> 29:50.782
No way a cell transmission
could make it through,

29:50.783 --> 29:52.850
Let alone actually get people
out of here safely.

29:52.851 --> 29:54.252
We can ride out the storm.

29:54.253 --> 29:55.620
No, if we can't shut down
the device,

29:55.621 --> 29:56.788
The heat-sink's going
to keep feeding cold air

29:56.789 --> 29:58.423
Into that weather system.

29:58.424 --> 29:59.991
It'll never stop.

29:59.992 --> 30:01.092
That's not good.

30:01.093 --> 30:02.860
No, I'd rather
that didn't happen.

30:02.861 --> 30:04.062
No, no, no, no.

30:04.063 --> 30:05.496
This might be
a good thing.

30:05.497 --> 30:06.531
What is it?

30:06.532 --> 30:07.765
Well, the containment field

30:07.766 --> 30:08.433
Is dying
a slow but consistent death.

30:08.434 --> 30:10.168
It might be weak enough

30:10.169 --> 30:12.370
To actually punch
a cell phone signal through now.

30:12.371 --> 30:13.371
Oh, you know,

30:13.372 --> 30:14.405
You might be right.

30:14.406 --> 30:16.140
Okay, this is probably
our best bet.

30:16.141 --> 30:17.242
These two emitters
are the weakest.

30:17.243 --> 30:18.443
It's a bit of a run
from here,

30:18.444 --> 30:20.345
So I'd better get going
right now.

30:20.346 --> 30:21.246
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

30:21.247 --> 30:23.014
Give me your cell.

30:23.015 --> 30:24.515
Huh?

30:24.516 --> 30:25.984
We need you here
to help dismantle the bridge.

30:25.985 --> 30:26.351
I'll make the call.

30:26.352 --> 30:27.719
I--

30:27.720 --> 30:28.686
Come on.

30:28.687 --> 30:29.654
All right,
all right.

30:29.655 --> 30:30.054
Fine.

30:30.055 --> 30:31.322
Thanks.

30:34.293 --> 30:35.960
I'm going to radio
once I get through.

30:35.961 --> 30:37.629
Good luck.

30:37.630 --> 30:38.730
You too.

30:43.302 --> 30:45.103
She seems like
a very capable woman.

30:45.104 --> 30:47.305
She sure is.

30:47.306 --> 30:47.906
She's your
sister, right?

30:47.907 --> 30:48.973
Is she single?

30:48.974 --> 30:49.674
[sighs]

30:49.675 --> 30:52.277
All right, where were we?

30:52.278 --> 30:53.811
Your idea

30:53.812 --> 30:55.013
Of overwhelming the bridge
to the point of collapse,

30:55.014 --> 30:55.680
It's a good one.

30:55.681 --> 30:57.382
It's right on track.

30:57.383 --> 30:58.850
But...

30:58.851 --> 30:59.817
Everybody here
thinks it means

30:59.818 --> 31:00.885
We've got to dial up
the heat-sink.

31:00.886 --> 31:02.887
It's going to get even colder.

31:02.888 --> 31:04.389
And that could result

31:04.390 --> 31:05.423
In an unpredictable amount
of freeze lightning...

31:05.424 --> 31:06.724
Which could kill us all.

31:06.725 --> 31:08.726
Right.

31:08.727 --> 31:10.461
The facility's furnace
just went down.

31:10.462 --> 31:11.963
Well, how did that happen?

31:11.964 --> 31:13.831
We've been running at 120%
for the last hour

31:13.832 --> 31:15.633
To compensate
for falling temperatures.

31:15.634 --> 31:17.302
We're in the middle
of the desert.

31:17.303 --> 31:19.971
The facility's not meant
to be heated like this.

31:19.972 --> 31:22.006
We'll get below freezing
pretty darn quick now.

31:22.007 --> 31:23.541
All right, well,
we can't power it down

31:23.542 --> 31:25.610
'cause it generates
its own power.

31:25.611 --> 31:27.045
And we can't wait

31:27.046 --> 31:28.212
For the containment field
to collapse

31:28.213 --> 31:29.547
Because the storm
will probably kill us.

31:29.548 --> 31:30.782
Guys, we don't
have a choice, okay.

31:30.783 --> 31:32.250
We've got to wait
for the bridge to peak,

31:32.251 --> 31:34.052
Dial up the heat-sink,
see if we can overwhelm it.

31:34.053 --> 31:36.321
I know it's dangerous,
but that's all we've got.

31:36.322 --> 31:37.755
Uh--

31:39.458 --> 31:41.092
Okay, look.

31:41.093 --> 31:42.026
There's too many people
in here.

31:42.027 --> 31:43.795
I have important
work to do.

31:43.796 --> 31:44.529
I do not need you
in the way,

31:44.530 --> 31:47.532
So, everybody, out!

31:50.603 --> 31:51.669
[¶]

31:55.441 --> 31:56.140
Oh, come on.

32:02.781 --> 32:04.916

32:04.917 --> 32:04.983
Oh, thank god.

General landry's office.

32:10.823 --> 32:12.757
Yes, this
is dr. Jennifer keller.

32:12.758 --> 32:13.458
I need to speak to the general
immediately.

32:13.459 --> 32:15.493
It's an emergency.

32:15.494 --> 32:17.128
[static crackles]

32:17.129 --> 32:18.463
Hello?

32:18.464 --> 32:20.398

Hello? This is dr.--

Hello?

[several beeps]

32:30.542 --> 32:33.478
Son of a bitch!

32:33.479 --> 32:35.613
Should we warn everyone
we're about to do this?

32:35.614 --> 32:38.116
No, no, that would
just cause a panic.

32:38.117 --> 32:39.250
It's probably better
they don't know.

32:39.251 --> 32:41.452
We have no way of moving people
to a safe area,

32:41.453 --> 32:42.387
Plus we have no idea

32:42.388 --> 32:43.855
Where the next
freeze lightning strike

32:43.856 --> 32:44.455
Could hit.

32:44.456 --> 32:45.924
[keyboard clacking]

32:45.925 --> 32:47.458
"freeze lightning--"

32:47.459 --> 32:48.893
You know,
that's a bad name.

32:48.894 --> 32:50.361
Don't look at me.
It's his idea.

32:50.362 --> 32:51.896
[stammers]

32:51.897 --> 32:53.064
Okay, here we go.

32:53.065 --> 32:54.766
[beeping,
power levels escalate]

32:56.235 --> 32:56.301
[shrieking]

32:59.138 --> 33:01.172
[items falling, crashing]

33:01.173 --> 33:02.607
All right,
shut it off.

33:02.608 --> 33:04.442
I can't. It hasn't
collapsed the bridge yet.

33:04.443 --> 33:06.177
I had a signal before.

33:06.178 --> 33:07.645
Come on!

33:07.646 --> 33:08.880
[shrieks]

33:16.655 --> 33:18.156
It's not working!

33:18.157 --> 33:19.157
We just need a little more time,
a little more time.

33:20.726 --> 33:22.660
The lightning strikes

33:22.661 --> 33:24.028
Are freezing off
whole sections of the facility.

33:24.029 --> 33:24.729
Everyone is getting isolated.

33:24.730 --> 33:26.364
It doesn't matter.

33:26.365 --> 33:29.200
They'll melt eventually
if we can shut this thing down.

33:29.201 --> 33:30.935
You are going to kill us all!

33:30.936 --> 33:32.804
Look, I just need
to keep doing--

33:32.805 --> 33:35.139
[system groaning,
power weakening]

33:35.140 --> 33:37.809
What did you do?

33:37.810 --> 33:39.477
I turned it down.

33:39.478 --> 33:41.079
What? Why?

33:41.080 --> 33:42.247
It was too dangerous.

33:42.248 --> 33:43.481
But we were
almost there.

33:43.482 --> 33:45.617
It was peaking out!
It was going to work.

33:45.618 --> 33:47.018
Yeah,
and we'd all be dead.

33:47.019 --> 33:48.286
We have to come up
with something else.

33:48.287 --> 33:49.721
Yeah, something fast!

33:49.722 --> 33:50.655
'cause the containment field
is about to fail.

33:52.958 --> 33:56.060
Great.

34:00.699 --> 34:02.267
Oh, not good.

34:06.272 --> 34:08.907
Rodney, can you hear me?

34:08.908 --> 34:11.074
Please tell me
you got through to the sgc?

34:11.076 --> 34:11.976
No.

34:11.976 --> 34:14.012
<i>You've got to
keep trying.</i>

34:14.013 --> 34:17.081
I'd love to, but my phone
got a little soaked.

34:17.081 --> 34:18.650
It's not even... Turning on.

34:18.650 --> 34:19.284
What?

34:19.284 --> 34:21.452
<i>My hallway got hit</i>

34:21.453 --> 34:23.221
By that freeze lightning thing.

34:23.222 --> 34:25.056
<i>Are you okay?</i>

34:25.056 --> 34:26.623
I am now,
but I won't be for long.

34:26.625 --> 34:28.226
What happened?

34:28.226 --> 34:30.094
<i>I'm frozen in.</i>

34:30.094 --> 34:32.330
[weakly]:
and the pipes busted open.

34:32.331 --> 34:36.333
My body temperature is dropping
really fast.

34:36.335 --> 34:38.469
Okay, I'll radio
security.

34:38.469 --> 34:40.371
I'll get someone
out to her right away.

34:40.371 --> 34:41.940
Look, security's on the way.

34:41.940 --> 34:43.708
I need you just to sit tight

34:43.708 --> 34:45.109
<i>And try to
stay warm, okay?</i>

34:45.110 --> 34:47.411
Okay.

34:47.413 --> 34:49.013
Sorry I didn't get
the call through.

34:49.014 --> 34:50.648
You did your best.

34:50.649 --> 34:53.051
Did you
shut down that thing down?

34:53.052 --> 34:54.619
Not yet.
We're working on it.

34:54.620 --> 34:55.119
Hurry.

34:55.120 --> 34:57.221
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:57.222 --> 34:58.156
[bill]: mckay!

34:58.157 --> 34:59.691
Okay, look,
I've got to go.

34:59.692 --> 35:00.592
<i>Someone's on the way,
all right.</i>

35:04.863 --> 35:05.630
What is it?

35:05.631 --> 35:07.265
Containment field
failure

35:07.266 --> 35:10.535
In 3... 2... 1...

35:10.536 --> 35:13.238
[electricity crackling loudly]

35:13.239 --> 35:16.174
[wind howling]

35:20.446 --> 35:22.780
Winds aloft.

35:22.781 --> 35:24.549
Reaching
dangerous levels.

35:24.550 --> 35:25.850
If it continues
like this,

35:25.851 --> 35:26.851
We'll have a mess of
tornadoes on our hands.

35:26.852 --> 35:29.921
Great. Even less time
before we die.

35:32.858 --> 35:34.893
[winds howling loudly]

35:41.267 --> 35:44.202
Look, this device is capable of
generating its own power, right?

35:44.203 --> 35:45.970
Yeah, a small percentage
of the energy we're transferring

35:45.971 --> 35:47.505
Is siphoned off
to power the device.

35:47.506 --> 35:49.607
So once it's running,
it's self-sustaining.

35:49.608 --> 35:51.476
Which is why we can't
just pull the plug.

35:51.477 --> 35:52.877
Exactly.

35:52.878 --> 35:54.345
But it's only capable
of powering itself
to a certain extent?

35:54.346 --> 35:56.281
It has a finite amount
of power generation capability?

35:56.282 --> 35:57.815
Well, yes, of course.

35:57.816 --> 35:59.817
Maybe we've been
approaching this the wrong way.

35:59.818 --> 36:01.486
We've been trying
to force so much power

36:01.487 --> 36:02.186
Through the bridge

36:02.187 --> 36:03.221
That it overloads it.

36:03.222 --> 36:05.123
Maybe we should starve it--

36:05.124 --> 36:06.391
Suck so much power
from its generator

36:06.392 --> 36:07.492
That it stalls it out.

36:07.493 --> 36:09.260
Technically, we could do that,

36:09.261 --> 36:10.328
But you'd have to draw
an insane amount of power.

36:10.329 --> 36:11.029
The heat-sink
could never do it.

36:11.030 --> 36:12.897
No...

36:12.898 --> 36:15.033
But another space-time bridge
could.

36:15.034 --> 36:17.535
You want to open another
space-time bridge?

36:17.536 --> 36:18.169
The device was rigged
to power a single bridge.

36:18.170 --> 36:20.204
We open another one...

36:20.205 --> 36:22.974
And it overwhelms the system
and it fails.

36:22.975 --> 36:24.375
It'll work.

36:24.376 --> 36:26.711
Y-yeah, but do you have
any idea

36:26.712 --> 36:27.979
How difficult it will be

36:27.980 --> 36:29.113
To configure the system

36:29.114 --> 36:31.249
To open two concurrent
space-time bridges?

36:31.250 --> 36:32.150
I never said it was
going to be easy.

36:32.151 --> 36:33.851
Well,
it'll be impossible.

36:33.852 --> 36:35.453
Hey, I'm dr. Rodney mckay,
all right?

36:35.454 --> 36:39.257
"difficult" takes a few seconds,
"impossible," a few minutes.

36:51.537 --> 36:53.871
[weakly]:
rodney, can you hear me?

36:53.872 --> 36:55.607
Have they got you
out of there yet?

36:55.608 --> 36:57.475
[labored breathing]: no.

36:57.476 --> 36:58.943
Tunney, what's the deal?

36:58.944 --> 36:59.577
I thought
you sent security.

36:59.578 --> 37:01.179
They can't get to her.

37:01.180 --> 37:03.081
What? Why not?

37:03.082 --> 37:05.083
Oh, that last round
of freeze lightning,

37:05.084 --> 37:06.584
It sealed off
a lot of the corridors.

37:06.585 --> 37:07.352
See, they're making
their way to her,

37:07.353 --> 37:08.720
But it'll
take some time.

37:08.721 --> 37:10.421
<i>It's getting harder...</i>

37:10.422 --> 37:11.723
Harder to stay awake.

37:11.724 --> 37:13.925
I'm going
into... Hypothermic shock.

37:13.926 --> 37:16.060
Jennifer, just hang
in there, all right?

37:16.061 --> 37:17.729
All right,
we're here, right?

37:17.730 --> 37:19.197
So we can get to her.
It's a straight shot.

37:19.198 --> 37:20.131
They should have come
this way, through the lab.

37:20.132 --> 37:21.833
They're cut off
from us too.

37:21.834 --> 37:22.800
I've got to
go get her.

37:22.801 --> 37:24.002
No, wait. We're a bit
busy right now.

37:24.003 --> 37:25.336
She'll die.

37:25.337 --> 37:26.471
If the storm keeps up
like this,

37:26.472 --> 37:27.071
It'll rip the building apart,
we'll all die!

37:27.072 --> 37:28.806
Last I checked,

37:28.807 --> 37:29.607
You were claiming
to be a genius.

37:29.608 --> 37:31.109
I already gave you the plan.

37:31.110 --> 37:31.876
A plan full of holes.

37:31.877 --> 37:33.011
So fill them!

37:33.012 --> 37:34.312
W-what if I run into
a problem?

37:34.313 --> 37:34.879
Work around it!

37:35.915 --> 37:38.316
[quietly]:
you're smarter than me.

37:38.717 --> 37:40.318
I know.

37:43.222 --> 37:44.656
Mckay!

37:44.657 --> 37:47.358
Oh, this is outrageous!

37:47.359 --> 37:49.160
When we need him the most,
he puts it on me,

37:49.161 --> 37:50.128
And I'm supposed to be
the one to--

37:50.129 --> 37:52.196
[smack, malcolm shouts]

37:52.197 --> 37:52.597
Man up.

38:13.586 --> 38:14.619
Jennifer!

38:19.458 --> 38:20.725
Okay, I think that's it.

38:20.726 --> 38:22.160
Before I run it,
just check my math.

38:22.161 --> 38:23.595
I have been!

38:23.596 --> 38:24.796
Why do you think
I'm standing here?

38:33.505 --> 38:34.973
[grunting with effort]:
jennifer!

38:37.343 --> 38:38.576
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

38:38.577 --> 38:41.179
Do it!

38:46.218 --> 38:48.386
You're not breathing.

38:48.387 --> 38:48.786
Oh, my god,
you're not breathing.

38:50.689 --> 38:52.390
Oh, please don't be dead.

38:52.391 --> 38:53.124
Please don't be dead.

38:55.361 --> 38:57.929
Come back to me, please.

38:59.932 --> 39:01.099
Please come back to me.

39:06.038 --> 39:07.739
It worked!

39:07.740 --> 39:09.941
The second space-time bridge
blew the power supply.

39:09.942 --> 39:13.511
Both bridges collapsed.

39:13.512 --> 39:14.345
I did it!

39:24.423 --> 39:26.558
Please...

39:26.559 --> 39:28.059
[coughs]

39:28.060 --> 39:28.560
[gasps]

39:28.561 --> 39:31.729
Oh, thank god.

39:31.730 --> 39:32.230
You're okay.

39:32.231 --> 39:34.799
You're okay...

39:34.800 --> 39:35.733
I'm really cold.

39:35.734 --> 39:38.202
Me too...

39:38.203 --> 39:40.471
You saved me.

39:40.472 --> 39:42.507
I guess that makes us even.

39:43.008 --> 39:45.410
I used an ax.

39:45.411 --> 39:46.578
A big ax.

39:46.579 --> 39:47.845
I really wish
you were conscious,

39:47.846 --> 39:49.480
'cause I think it's the
coolest thing I've ever done--

39:52.051 --> 39:55.086
Oh...

39:55.087 --> 39:56.187
I don't know
what I would have done

39:56.188 --> 39:57.388
If I lost you...

39:57.990 --> 40:00.458
I love you.

40:03.229 --> 40:04.362
I have for some time now.

40:07.199 --> 40:08.800
I just wanted you to know.

40:10.436 --> 40:11.636
I--

40:17.209 --> 40:19.410
[¶]

40:25.818 --> 40:27.685
Well, at least your friends

40:27.686 --> 40:30.188
Don't think you're a washout
anymore.

40:30.189 --> 40:31.723
Stupid bill nye

40:31.724 --> 40:33.191
Is telling everyone
who will listen

40:33.192 --> 40:34.926
That tunney's the guy
who turned the device off.

40:34.927 --> 40:36.561
Because he was the one
that shut off the device.

40:36.562 --> 40:38.663
With my coding.
It was my idea.

40:38.664 --> 40:39.931
Rodney, does it really matter?

40:42.201 --> 40:44.903
Yes. Yes, it does.

40:44.904 --> 40:47.338
I'm sorry,

40:47.339 --> 40:48.039
I know I'm supposed
to be humble,

40:48.040 --> 40:49.040
Not supposed to care,

40:49.041 --> 40:50.575
But I do, I really do.

40:50.576 --> 40:51.342
And that's... That's something
you should know about me.

40:51.343 --> 40:53.444
Well, quit, then.

40:53.445 --> 40:55.213
Join the private sector.

40:55.214 --> 40:57.215
Start doing work
the whole world can see.

40:57.216 --> 40:59.117
I've been thinking about it.

40:59.118 --> 41:00.451
What? No, you haven't.

41:00.452 --> 41:02.120
My contract with sgc
is up this year.

41:02.121 --> 41:03.988
Maybe it's time to move on,
time to do other things.

41:03.989 --> 41:06.024
Please...

41:06.025 --> 41:06.524
I don't know anyone
who loves their job

41:06.525 --> 41:08.359
More than you.

41:08.360 --> 41:10.428
Mm.

41:10.429 --> 41:12.130
So you think
the military

41:12.131 --> 41:14.232
Is going to let them
keep experimenting?

41:14.233 --> 41:15.833
I think
it's highly unlikely.

41:15.834 --> 41:17.969
Besides, geoengineering
is a dumb pursuit anyway.

41:17.970 --> 41:19.837
No one person's going to solve
global warming.

41:19.838 --> 41:21.773
We all have to do
our part.

41:21.774 --> 41:24.576
Like not take private jets.

41:24.577 --> 41:27.045
Well, they were going our way
anyway.

41:30.883 --> 41:35.453
You know, it's kind of nice,
just me and you back here.

41:35.454 --> 41:36.888
Right.

41:41.060 --> 41:41.125
Right!

41:43.862 --> 41:45.230
You were legally dead
a few hours ago.

41:45.231 --> 41:45.930
You were practically frozen.

41:45.931 --> 41:47.565
You really want to...

41:47.566 --> 41:49.133
Well, it's either that

41:49.134 --> 41:50.602
Or you keep telling me

41:50.603 --> 41:52.170
How you, and only you,
saved the day.

41:52.538 --> 41:54.572
Nah...

41:56.075 --> 41:59.410
I'm trying out this whole
"humble" thing out.

41:59.411 --> 42:01.779
Seems to be quite a hit
with the ladies...
