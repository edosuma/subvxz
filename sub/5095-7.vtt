00:03.567 --> 00:05.300
Good morning, everyone.

00:05.302 --> 00:06.801
Camera three,
you have the commissioner.

00:06.803 --> 00:08.203
Camera two, you have Norah.

00:08.205 --> 00:10.338
Camera one,
you'll get the D.A.

00:10.340 --> 00:14.042
Stand by to cue Norah
in seven, six...

00:14.044 --> 00:17.212
...five, four, three...

00:17.214 --> 00:19.181
...two, one.

00:19.183 --> 00:20.482
Welcome back.

00:20.484 --> 00:22.050
Joining us this morning
are two of the men

00:22.052 --> 00:24.186
most responsible for
the safety and welfare

00:24.188 --> 00:25.720
of the great city we call home:

00:25.722 --> 00:28.423
veteran New York City Police
Commissioner Frank Reagan...

00:28.425 --> 00:30.425
Thank you, Norah.
A pleasure to be here.

00:30.427 --> 00:32.394
...and the newly
appointed interim

00:32.396 --> 00:34.062
Manhattan District Attorney,
Robert McCoy.

00:34.064 --> 00:34.996
Welcome.

00:34.998 --> 00:36.998
Thank you, Norah.
Commissioner,

00:37.000 --> 00:39.167
under your watch,
this city has been enjoying

00:39.169 --> 00:41.169
a significant
reduction in crime

00:41.171 --> 00:42.404
in the last
two years.

00:42.406 --> 00:43.638
There are some people
that are saying

00:43.640 --> 00:47.075
this is now the "safest
big city in America."

00:47.077 --> 00:48.443
What do you
attribute that to?

00:48.445 --> 00:50.478
Well, Norah, it's been

00:50.480 --> 00:52.881
a pretty straightforward
approach.

00:52.883 --> 00:55.250
More trained officers
in the high-crime areas,

00:55.252 --> 00:57.285
making solid arrests,
and, of course,

00:57.287 --> 00:58.620
following cases

00:58.622 --> 00:59.988
through to their
conclusion.

00:59.990 --> 01:02.691
But it certainly
has been a successful strategy.

01:02.693 --> 01:04.325
Thank you, Norah.
Mm-hmm.

01:04.328 --> 01:05.727
Thank you very much.

01:05.729 --> 01:07.529
But there's always
room for improvement.

01:07.531 --> 01:10.298
What do you mean, Mr. McCoy?
If you drill down

01:10.300 --> 01:13.501
on the numbers, you can see that
we devote far too many resources

01:13.503 --> 01:16.371
to so-called quality-of-life
crimes. I think those resources

01:16.373 --> 01:19.541
could be put to better use
to further reduce the incidents

01:19.543 --> 01:21.910
of violent
and destructive felonies.

01:21.912 --> 01:24.512
Well, Norah,
quality-of-life crimes lead

01:24.514 --> 01:27.249
to the breakdown of communities,
which lead

01:27.251 --> 01:29.684
to more of the exact kind
of crimes you're talking about.

01:29.686 --> 01:30.852
With all due respect,

01:30.854 --> 01:33.688
I don't think the
facts bear that out.

01:33.690 --> 01:36.124
They do if you know
how to read them.

01:37.327 --> 01:38.460
Well, Mr. McCoy,

01:38.462 --> 01:40.495
what kind of changes
are you gonna be making?

01:40.497 --> 01:42.063
Well, for example,
I'm instructing

01:42.065 --> 01:43.098
my assistant district attorneys

01:43.100 --> 01:44.833
that we are no longer
going to prosecute

01:44.835 --> 01:48.803
petty marijuana possession
charges.

01:48.805 --> 01:52.173
That would be a rookie mistake
of the first stripe.

01:52.175 --> 01:54.442
Commissioner,
I may have been born yesterday,

01:54.444 --> 01:57.412
but I stayed up late studying.

01:57.414 --> 02:00.448
So let me get this
straight, you're not gonna

02:00.450 --> 02:03.885
prosecute crimes,
even after police make arrests?

02:03.887 --> 02:06.554
I would look for Commissioner
Reagan's cooperation in setting

02:06.556 --> 02:08.556
new guidelines
for his officers, yes.

02:08.558 --> 02:10.658
Well, Commissioner,
your response on that.

02:10.661 --> 02:15.297
I would say to the interim D.A.
that's a fool's errand.

02:15.299 --> 02:17.465
Mom, hurry up!

02:17.467 --> 02:19.200
What?

02:19.202 --> 02:21.403
Your boss is
going after Grandpa big-time.

02:21.405 --> 02:23.972
It's a matter of
where to best allocate

02:23.974 --> 02:24.906
energy and resources.

02:24.908 --> 02:26.508
Commissioner.

02:26.510 --> 02:31.713
Look, I did not come here
to debate policy,

02:31.715 --> 02:33.748
and there are
certainly guidelines

02:33.750 --> 02:35.717
which must be followed in order

02:35.719 --> 02:38.920
to change laws, which is
what we're talking about here.

02:38.922 --> 02:39.888
I'm not changing laws.
You're talking

02:39.890 --> 02:41.823
about selectively
enforcing them,

02:41.825 --> 02:43.291
which is effectively
the same thing.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.627
And you disagree
with that.

02:45.629 --> 02:48.129
Of course I do.

02:48.131 --> 02:49.597
You guys came loaded for this.

02:49.599 --> 02:52.534
Garrett, he is merely
announcing new policy.

02:52.536 --> 02:54.536
On national TV
with no forewarning?

02:54.538 --> 02:57.739
That's not an announcement;
that's an ambush.

02:58.942 --> 03:02.510
Commissioner?

03:02.512 --> 03:05.580
Okay. We will leave it there.

03:05.582 --> 03:07.282
Thank you, gentlemen.

03:07.284 --> 03:09.250
To be continued.

03:09.252 --> 03:10.819
Condron, that's two strikes.

03:10.821 --> 03:13.021
One more, the judge is gonna
turn this leather jacket

03:13.023 --> 03:15.190
into an orange jumpsuit.

03:19.763 --> 03:21.730
Where's my partner?

03:21.732 --> 03:23.365
You're looking at her.

03:23.367 --> 03:25.133
What?
I make it my business

03:25.135 --> 03:29.738
to partner at least one tour
with every one of my detectives.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.673
Your detectives?
So I can get to know them

03:31.675 --> 03:33.775
on a deeper level.

03:33.777 --> 03:35.910
Baez.

03:35.912 --> 03:39.214
Look, there's really
nothing more to me.

03:39.216 --> 03:41.449
What you see is what you get,
so how 'bout we take a pass?

03:41.451 --> 03:43.852
Detective Reagan and I will be
in the field.

03:43.854 --> 03:45.820
If anything comes up,
you can get me on my cell phone.

03:45.822 --> 03:46.855
Sure.

03:46.857 --> 03:48.390
No problem.

03:48.392 --> 03:50.258
Let's go, Reagan.

03:51.995 --> 03:55.063
This ought to be fun.

03:58.969 --> 04:01.803
This came in as a 10-10?

04:01.805 --> 04:03.571
Yeah, possible crime.

04:03.573 --> 04:05.573
Probably turn out
to be nothing.

04:05.575 --> 04:07.842
"Sorry, I can't do this
anymore..."

04:07.844 --> 04:08.877
Huh?!

04:08.879 --> 04:10.545
What?

04:10.547 --> 04:12.113
Pete just broke up with me.

04:12.115 --> 04:13.348
Oh, the stockbroker?

04:13.350 --> 04:15.049
No, the start-up guy.

04:15.051 --> 04:16.885
I didn't think you
were that into him.

04:16.887 --> 04:18.685
That's not the point.

04:18.688 --> 04:20.288
What is?

04:20.290 --> 04:21.856
He says I'm demanding.
Can you believe that?

04:21.858 --> 04:24.025
Do you think
I'm demanding?

04:26.963 --> 04:29.330
Think we can rule out
a possible crime.

04:29.332 --> 04:31.666
My God.

You said it was just
to meet the new team.

05:08.655 --> 05:10.388
A victory lap
is what you called it.

05:10.390 --> 05:12.257
I had no idea what
they were planning.

05:12.259 --> 05:13.858
I think that was clear
to everybody.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.760
There's no way I
could have known.

05:15.762 --> 05:17.028
It's your job to know.

05:17.030 --> 05:19.030
Really? How so?

05:19.032 --> 05:21.099
Honestly, Frank,
that's like me saying

05:21.101 --> 05:23.601
a guy goes on a shooting spree--
you should've known,

05:23.603 --> 05:24.802
gotten out ahead of it.

05:24.804 --> 05:26.304
That's just idiotic.

05:26.306 --> 05:27.538
Exactly my point.

05:27.540 --> 05:29.107
I can't read minds.

05:29.109 --> 05:31.509
Oh, cut it out.
No one's asking you to.

05:31.511 --> 05:33.111
Then what's the problem?
That we got blindsided?

05:33.113 --> 05:34.512
Hey, it happens.

05:34.514 --> 05:37.015
Did you reach out to your
sources in the D.A.'s office?

05:37.017 --> 05:38.316
Find out what McCoy

05:38.318 --> 05:40.485
was vetting with his staff?

05:40.487 --> 05:42.186
No. I didn't think I had to.

05:42.188 --> 05:44.722
Turns out you had to.

05:44.724 --> 05:46.024
Just for the record,

05:46.026 --> 05:48.626
you've done hundreds
of interviews, Frank.

05:48.628 --> 05:51.562
I'd think by now you'd know
how to hold your tongue.

05:51.564 --> 05:54.265
I'm doing that right now.

06:09.783 --> 06:11.015
You the detective on the case?

06:11.017 --> 06:12.684
Detective Welby.
I'm Officer Reagan.

06:12.686 --> 06:14.485
This is Officer Janko.

06:16.456 --> 06:19.524
There were no witnesses.

06:19.526 --> 06:22.961
Just a... anonymous caller
phoned it in.

06:22.963 --> 06:24.762
What a relief
this is a suicide.

06:24.764 --> 06:26.431
Eight open cases
as it is.

06:26.433 --> 06:28.066
I usually get
jumpers.

06:28.068 --> 06:30.134
New York is
a jumper's paradise--

06:30.136 --> 06:33.338
tall buildings, bridges,
subways.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.073
Suicide tourism.

06:35.075 --> 06:37.041
Suicide tourism?

06:37.043 --> 06:39.143
What better place?

06:39.145 --> 06:41.679
Hangings, on the other hand,
are almost always homegrown.

06:41.681 --> 06:43.681
Rose Davis. Brooklyn.

06:43.683 --> 06:45.683
See?

06:45.685 --> 06:47.752
If she was an out-of-towner,
she'd have gone for

06:47.754 --> 06:49.120
the Brooklyn Bridge or
the Empire State Building.

06:49.122 --> 06:50.788
Personally, I prefer the G.W.

06:50.790 --> 06:52.757
212 feet down.

06:52.759 --> 06:55.560
It's guaranteed death. You?

06:55.562 --> 06:57.562
Oh.

06:57.564 --> 06:59.864
I've never thought
about it before.

07:01.101 --> 07:02.800
Me neither.

07:02.802 --> 07:04.602
There's a suicide
every 40 seconds.

07:04.604 --> 07:06.437
Can you notify

07:06.439 --> 07:07.605
the next of kin?

07:10.810 --> 07:14.145
As long as the...
boss says it's okay.

07:14.147 --> 07:16.547
Boss knows I don't
do notifications.

07:16.549 --> 07:18.449
Ever.

07:27.093 --> 07:28.659
What the hell were you thinking?

07:28.661 --> 07:30.461
What was <i> I</i> thinking?

07:30.463 --> 07:32.630
Your father called me a fool
on national TV.

07:32.632 --> 07:33.664
You don't just spring

07:33.666 --> 07:37.668
major policy changes
on a live news show.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.437
You think I was supposed to
give him a heads up?

07:39.439 --> 07:41.205
Yes.
Why?

07:41.207 --> 07:43.741
So he could come fully loaded
with arguments against?

07:43.743 --> 07:45.343
This isn't court, Bobby.

07:45.345 --> 07:47.979
You didn't need to approach it
like a defense attorney,

07:47.981 --> 07:51.182
as if he's the enemy and
you needed to win at all costs.

07:51.184 --> 07:52.583
I wasn't trying to win anything.

07:52.585 --> 07:55.920
An opportunity presented itself,
and I ran with it.

07:55.922 --> 07:57.955
You didn't even discuss it
with your own A.D.A.s.

07:57.957 --> 07:59.657
You didn't think
we deserved a heads up?

07:59.659 --> 08:02.160
You are not in private
practice anymore.

08:02.162 --> 08:04.495
Everything you say and do
reflects on this office

08:04.497 --> 08:06.197
and the people in it.

08:06.199 --> 08:08.066
You don't agree
with what I said?

08:08.068 --> 08:11.302
It is not about agreeing;
it's how you presented it.

08:12.939 --> 08:14.372
You've been the D.A.
for two months;

08:14.374 --> 08:15.540
you've already
alienated the PC,

08:15.542 --> 08:17.508
not to mention half the people
in this office.

08:17.510 --> 08:19.844
Would you feel the same way
if he wasn't your father?

08:19.846 --> 08:21.712
A hundred percent.

08:34.461 --> 08:37.294
Her body's being brought to
the medical examiner's office.

08:37.297 --> 08:38.962
We can take you there.

08:38.965 --> 08:40.965
No, no, no.

08:40.967 --> 08:43.234
Not right now.

08:45.105 --> 08:46.737
Okay.

08:46.739 --> 08:49.574
This is the address
of the M.E.'s office

08:49.576 --> 08:51.576
and phone number.

08:52.412 --> 08:54.378
Okay.

08:54.380 --> 08:55.713
And below

08:55.715 --> 08:58.649
is the-the case number that
you can reference when you call.

09:01.354 --> 09:03.321
Mm-hmm.

09:03.323 --> 09:05.490
We're very sorry
for your loss.

09:05.492 --> 09:07.625
Me, too.

09:12.599 --> 09:15.066
That was so depressing.

09:15.068 --> 09:17.702
That's why you have to distance
yourself from these things.

09:17.704 --> 09:21.305
Yeah, well, it certainly puts
getting dumped in perspective.

09:21.307 --> 09:22.540
Officers.

09:24.611 --> 09:26.244
She didn't kill herself.

09:26.246 --> 09:28.079
She wouldn't do that.

09:28.081 --> 09:29.380
What?

09:29.382 --> 09:31.349
I'm Rose Davis's grandmother.

09:31.351 --> 09:33.518
I know it looks
that way, but...

09:33.520 --> 09:35.386
she just bought tickets
for she and me

09:35.388 --> 09:37.388
to go see <i> Wicked</i> next Friday.

09:37.390 --> 09:38.523
Look, Mrs. Davis...

09:38.525 --> 09:40.491
Officer, I raised her,

09:40.493 --> 09:43.494
and I'm telling you
she wouldn't do this.

09:43.496 --> 09:45.963
Are you saying
y-you think she was killed?

09:45.965 --> 09:49.400
Yes, I am. There was this guy
she was having trouble with.

09:49.402 --> 09:51.335
He was threatening her.

09:51.337 --> 09:52.303
Who-who was that?

09:52.305 --> 09:53.704
I don't know.

09:53.706 --> 09:55.139
Look, I know this is

09:55.141 --> 09:57.642
a lot to ask...

09:57.644 --> 09:59.744
but she was my life.

10:00.980 --> 10:04.682
She would never, never do this.

10:16.629 --> 10:17.628
You don't like my driving?

10:17.630 --> 10:18.830
I don't like
being a passenger.

10:18.831 --> 10:19.764
How 'bout that?

10:19.766 --> 10:21.799
Yeah, no kidding.

10:21.801 --> 10:23.868
Why'd you become a cop?

10:23.870 --> 10:26.671
You do know
who my family is, right?

10:26.673 --> 10:28.206
What does that mean?

10:28.208 --> 10:30.174
You did it 'cause it's
the family business?

10:30.176 --> 10:31.609
What difference does it make?

10:31.611 --> 10:34.212
I don't like sitting
behind a desk. How 'bout that?

10:35.448 --> 10:36.948
What about you?

10:36.950 --> 10:40.218
What's the, uh,
"Dee" for Dee Ann Carver?

10:40.220 --> 10:43.321
What difference
does it make?

10:44.157 --> 10:46.324
You know,
I never had a boss

10:46.326 --> 10:48.492
who wanted to do this--
you know,

10:48.494 --> 10:51.229
drive around
with their detectives.

10:51.231 --> 10:53.631
I think a good boss gets
to know each detective's

10:53.633 --> 10:55.666
strengths and weaknesses.

10:55.668 --> 10:59.770
Oh. Well, I could tell you
my strength: closing cases.

10:59.772 --> 11:01.305
And my weakness is this.

11:01.307 --> 11:03.841
What? Talking?
No.

11:03.843 --> 11:06.510
Whatever it is
we're doing there.

11:09.349 --> 11:10.815
Gunshot.

11:13.820 --> 11:14.820
Right here.
Right here.

11:17.090 --> 11:19.290
There they are.
I'm going.

11:19.292 --> 11:21.058
I'll take the back!
I'll be there!

11:40.313 --> 11:42.546
Damn it.

11:46.586 --> 11:47.485
Hey!

11:47.487 --> 11:50.187
Come here.
Come here. Come here.

11:50.657 --> 11:52.023
What happened?

11:52.025 --> 11:53.224
Somebody opened
fire on us, man.

11:53.226 --> 11:54.692
What do you mean? Who?

11:54.694 --> 11:55.660
Who?!

11:55.662 --> 11:57.461
A drive-by.
Drive-by?

11:57.463 --> 11:59.797
You were hit in a drive-by
and your instinct

11:59.799 --> 12:01.932
when you see a cop
is to run? Huh?

12:01.934 --> 12:04.201
Put that on your leg.
Stay put.

12:16.082 --> 12:18.316
My baby.

12:18.318 --> 12:20.418
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay. What?

12:20.420 --> 12:21.519
My baby. My baby.

12:21.521 --> 12:23.120
Where's your baby?
My baby.

12:33.066 --> 12:35.466
Okay, okay. Okay.

12:35.468 --> 12:38.369
Is that baby hit?!

12:38.371 --> 12:40.771
She's okay.

12:40.773 --> 12:43.140
She's okay. Her
mother's in bad shape.

12:43.142 --> 12:44.608
She's right over there.

12:44.610 --> 12:46.877
- Okay.
- Where's my baby?

12:46.879 --> 12:48.579
Come on. Stay with me now.
Come on.

12:48.581 --> 12:50.314
5-4, detective to Central.

12:50.316 --> 12:52.917
I need a 10-85 forthwith.

12:52.919 --> 12:54.352
My baby.
Your baby's fine.

12:54.354 --> 12:55.519
We got your baby.

12:55.521 --> 12:56.821
...to this location.

12:56.823 --> 12:59.156
We are at 1010 Euclid Avenue.

12:59.158 --> 13:01.459
Danny.

13:01.461 --> 13:03.260
Three shots fired.
Multiple victims.

13:03.262 --> 13:05.796
Repeat, multiple victims!

13:12.321 --> 13:14.043
The girl's grandmother?

13:14.067 --> 13:16.474
She insists Rose Davis wouldn't
have committed suicide.

13:16.474 --> 13:18.841
And she wants an investigation
to rule out homicide.

13:18.843 --> 13:21.243
I've had 12 suicides.
For every single one,

13:21.245 --> 13:22.544
the family insists
there's no way

13:22.546 --> 13:24.046
the victim
would kill themselves.

13:24.048 --> 13:25.714
No harm in
looking into it, right?

13:25.716 --> 13:27.750
I'd love to look into it,
but I got two open homicides,

13:27.752 --> 13:30.719
a trial prep
and six other open cases.

13:30.721 --> 13:32.821
She said there was a
boyfriend who threatened her.

13:32.823 --> 13:36.158
You know how many suicides
end up in murder? 1.75%.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.460
Wait, forget the statistics.

13:38.462 --> 13:39.561
If you'd made

13:39.563 --> 13:41.230
the notification
and seen the grandmother,

13:41.232 --> 13:43.932
you'd feel like we do, that
this deserves a second look.

13:43.934 --> 13:46.535
The M.E. classified it
a suicide.

13:46.537 --> 13:49.104
Thanks for the help.

13:49.106 --> 13:51.807
Wait...

13:51.809 --> 13:54.877
How's that distancing yourself
working out?

14:17.535 --> 14:19.535
Hi.

14:21.872 --> 14:23.405
Hi.

14:23.407 --> 14:26.275
I came by to see what you need
for Sunday dinner.

14:28.112 --> 14:30.713
I sense an ulterior motive.

14:33.484 --> 14:36.719
I thought Mr. McCoy should have
treated you with more respect,

14:36.721 --> 14:39.455
and I told him as much.

14:39.457 --> 14:41.790
Respect was the least of it.

14:42.626 --> 14:45.060
There was bad judgment
on both sides.

14:45.062 --> 14:47.162
There was provocation
then reaction.

14:47.164 --> 14:49.465
Those are two different things.

14:52.403 --> 14:55.437
And...

14:55.439 --> 14:58.607
why wouldn't you give me
a heads up?

14:58.609 --> 15:01.877
I didn't know about it.

15:01.879 --> 15:04.480
Really?

15:04.482 --> 15:07.549
The D.A. issues
a blanket statement saying

15:07.551 --> 15:10.486
he won't prosecute
certain crimes,

15:10.488 --> 15:14.223
and he doesn't share that tidbit
with his own prosecutors?

15:19.697 --> 15:21.663
I don't like the guy.

15:21.665 --> 15:24.833
You always say that.

15:31.542 --> 15:33.442
You're seeing him.

15:39.283 --> 15:41.750
You're seeing him?

15:41.752 --> 15:43.752
Was.

15:43.754 --> 15:45.020
Did.

15:45.022 --> 15:47.456
It has
nothing to do

15:47.458 --> 15:49.124
with this, Dad.

15:49.126 --> 15:50.793
You expect me to believe <i> that?</i>

15:50.795 --> 15:52.060
Yes.

15:52.062 --> 15:55.197
Well, to quote the guy
you're seeing,

15:55.199 --> 15:59.134
"I may have been born yesterday,
but I stayed up late studying."

16:08.145 --> 16:10.612
I wasn't dealing.
I got no drugs on me.

16:10.614 --> 16:12.014
It's 'cause you ditched them.
I didn't ditch them.

16:12.016 --> 16:13.016
Yeah, you did.

16:13.017 --> 16:14.917
I saw you.
You didn't see squat!

16:14.919 --> 16:16.485
Hey! Turn around!

16:16.487 --> 16:18.320
Don't raise your voice at me!

16:19.456 --> 16:20.556
You hear me?

16:20.558 --> 16:21.857
Do it again!

16:21.859 --> 16:23.192
Do it again.
I promise you

16:23.194 --> 16:25.394
I'll spend every minute
making your life miserable.

16:25.396 --> 16:26.562
Tough guy.
I know where you live.

16:26.564 --> 16:28.030
I know where
your mother lives!

16:28.032 --> 16:29.064
Detective Reagan!

16:31.202 --> 16:33.035
I'll take it from here.

16:36.607 --> 16:39.441
Truthfully, we didn't find
any drugs on you,

16:39.443 --> 16:41.043
and nobody saw you ditch them.

16:41.045 --> 16:42.077
You got that right.

16:42.079 --> 16:44.379
But I'm not concerned
with you.

16:44.381 --> 16:46.582
I'm concerned with
a ten-month-old innocent baby

16:46.584 --> 16:49.284
who's now in the system
because her mother is dead

16:49.286 --> 16:52.521
and we can't find
any family members.

16:53.290 --> 16:56.158
- Lorena died?
- She bled out

16:56.160 --> 16:58.427
nice and slow from the bullet
she caught in her neck

16:58.429 --> 17:00.362
thanks to you.

17:08.939 --> 17:12.374
If you cooperate,
I'll talk to the D.A.'s office,

17:12.376 --> 17:15.810
and maybe they let
the resisting arrest go away.

17:21.285 --> 17:23.585
I just know there was
some bad blood recently

17:23.587 --> 17:25.287
between two drug dealers.

17:25.289 --> 17:27.155
Who?

17:27.156 --> 17:29.825
Ramos and Acevedo.

17:31.929 --> 17:34.162
Where'd the bad blood come from?

17:34.164 --> 17:36.498
- I don't know.
- Here.

17:37.167 --> 17:38.700
Write down their
full names,

17:38.702 --> 17:40.936
nicknames and
any place

17:40.938 --> 17:45.908
you can think of where we might
find either one of them.

17:45.910 --> 17:48.777
I wasn't the one dealing.

17:49.780 --> 17:51.446
She didn't get killed
'cause of me.

17:51.448 --> 17:54.016
Keep telling yourself that,
tough guy.

18:00.357 --> 18:02.157
So, you offer
a gangbanger

18:02.159 --> 18:04.459
with a history the
length of my arm a deal?

18:04.461 --> 18:05.961
I thought
the information he had

18:05.963 --> 18:08.730
was worth talking to the D.A.
about a reduced charge.

18:08.732 --> 18:10.933
I could've got the same
information without leniency.

18:10.935 --> 18:15.037
Maybe that's why your file
is full of complaints.

18:15.039 --> 18:16.805
It's also full of closed cases.

18:16.807 --> 18:18.807
And commendations.

18:18.809 --> 18:22.311
It's why you have a reputation
for being difficult.

18:22.313 --> 18:24.112
Just like you?

18:25.316 --> 18:26.882
You're not the only one
who knows

18:26.884 --> 18:29.017
how to read people's files.

18:31.889 --> 18:33.622
<i>Where were you Tuesday morning</i>

18:33.624 --> 18:35.324
between 2:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.?

18:35.326 --> 18:37.993
Twice a week, I deejay
at a club in the Village.

18:37.995 --> 18:40.228
Mm-hmm.
The Arcadia.

18:40.230 --> 18:42.464
That's where I was.
You can check.

18:42.466 --> 18:44.499
How well
did you know Rose?

18:44.501 --> 18:46.234
What's this about?

18:46.236 --> 18:47.903
Rose killed herself.

18:47.905 --> 18:49.004
Grandmother doesn't think so.

18:49.006 --> 18:51.106
You mean she was killed?

18:51.108 --> 18:52.274
We don't know that for sure yet.

18:52.276 --> 18:54.943
She did say that
you threatened her.

18:54.945 --> 18:56.311
Wait, you think
Rose could've been killed,

18:56.313 --> 18:58.213
and you're looking at me
like I'm a suspect?

18:58.215 --> 18:59.481
Are you kidding me?

18:59.483 --> 19:00.782
Did you threaten her?

19:00.784 --> 19:03.452
I loved her more than anything.

19:03.454 --> 19:05.020
The only thing
we ever fought about

19:05.022 --> 19:07.089
was her job as a bartender.

19:08.359 --> 19:09.992
I wanted her to quit.

19:09.994 --> 19:11.660
Why'd you want her
to quit her job?

19:11.662 --> 19:13.228
Her boss, Christiano,
kept harassing her,

19:13.230 --> 19:16.031
asking her out,
making lewd comments.

19:16.033 --> 19:17.933
She'd come home crying.

19:17.935 --> 19:20.502
Finally, she listened to me.

19:20.504 --> 19:22.671
When did she quit?

19:22.673 --> 19:24.873
Two days ago.

19:24.875 --> 19:27.042
Day before she died.

19:30.581 --> 19:32.214
That's him in the black hat.

19:32.216 --> 19:34.049
The drug dealer Rudy gave up.

19:34.051 --> 19:36.218
Acevedo.

19:37.121 --> 19:39.287
Acevedo.

19:40.124 --> 19:41.189
Whoa!

19:41.191 --> 19:42.191
Hold it!

19:44.061 --> 19:45.660
Hey!

19:47.965 --> 19:49.531
Stop! Police!

19:52.403 --> 19:54.136
Sic him, Rambo! Sic him!

20:11.955 --> 20:13.822
Get down!

20:15.426 --> 20:16.658
Come here.

20:21.198 --> 20:23.865
Tell us who
shot Lorena.

20:23.867 --> 20:26.401
I got nothing to do with Lorena.
She was Ramos's girl.

20:26.403 --> 20:28.470
What does that mean?
He killed her?

20:28.472 --> 20:29.538
I didn't say that.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.006
Yeah, well, you better
start saying something

20:31.008 --> 20:32.107
before I charge you
with felony assault.

20:32.109 --> 20:33.075
I didn't hit you!

20:33.077 --> 20:36.311
You had sicced
your dog on me!

20:36.313 --> 20:37.412
Same thing!

20:37.414 --> 20:38.480
Now start talking.

20:38.482 --> 20:40.182
Well, Ramos is six months

20:40.184 --> 20:41.950
into a four-year bit for drugs.

20:41.952 --> 20:43.485
And that's
when he found out

20:43.487 --> 20:44.553
she was pregnant?

20:44.555 --> 20:46.154
So it wasn't
drug-related?

20:46.156 --> 20:48.690
Ramos does the math,
knows the baby's not his.

20:48.692 --> 20:49.958
How you guys know?

20:49.960 --> 20:51.460
Hey, shut up. We'll
ask the questions.

20:51.462 --> 20:52.794
Who's the baby's father?

20:52.796 --> 20:54.696
Look, all I know is
Ramos was going around,

20:54.698 --> 20:56.665
saying he was gonna kill her
and the baby.

20:56.667 --> 20:57.899
I guess he got

20:57.901 --> 20:59.534
one out of two.

21:02.072 --> 21:03.138
You all right?

21:03.140 --> 21:04.539
Me? Yeah.

21:04.541 --> 21:06.741
I'm getting used
to being attacked at work.

21:17.173 --> 21:19.298
So the baby was
the actual target.

21:19.299 --> 21:20.834
Well, then who's
the shooter?

21:21.075 --> 21:22.875
Someone Ramos hired?

21:22.877 --> 21:24.777
Well, we should get
a DNA test on the baby

21:24.779 --> 21:26.278
and try to figure
who the father is.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.780
Run it through CODIS.

21:27.782 --> 21:30.216
Given the drug connection, this
guy's probably been locked up,

21:30.218 --> 21:32.752
so it shouldn't be too
hard to track him down.

21:32.754 --> 21:34.487
But I hope we don't.
Why?

21:34.489 --> 21:36.822
'Cause the baby's better
off with foster parents.

21:36.824 --> 21:38.090
How would you know that?

21:38.092 --> 21:39.692
What, you think the
baby's better off

21:39.694 --> 21:41.594
with a drug-dealing father?
We don't know anything

21:41.596 --> 21:43.295
about this baby's family
or its parentage.

21:43.297 --> 21:45.264
Come on, we can
make a good guess.

21:45.266 --> 21:46.399
Maybe you can.

21:46.401 --> 21:49.101
And I don't know
what kind of checking up

21:49.103 --> 21:51.804
you did on me, or what it is
you think you know,

21:51.806 --> 21:56.275
but the only reputation I have
is for sticking to the rules.

21:56.277 --> 21:57.810
You also have a reputation

21:57.812 --> 22:00.112
for giving complaints
to your own officers.

22:00.114 --> 22:01.914
If they deserve it.

22:01.916 --> 22:05.151
Any officer who does their job
deserves their boss's support.

22:05.153 --> 22:10.623
I support any cop
who plays by the rules.

22:27.341 --> 22:28.407
Excuse us.

22:28.409 --> 22:30.776
What can I do for you?

22:30.778 --> 22:32.044
We're looking
for Christiano.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.880
He didn't come in today.

22:36.818 --> 22:40.453
Well, when was
the last time you saw him?

22:40.455 --> 22:41.987
Couple days ago.

22:41.989 --> 22:44.557
Around the time Rose quit?

22:45.393 --> 22:47.526
You know Rose?

22:47.528 --> 22:49.428
Yeah.

22:49.430 --> 22:50.896
Is she okay?

22:50.898 --> 22:53.699
She killed herself.

22:54.535 --> 22:56.502
Oh, my God.

22:56.504 --> 22:59.472
Why did you ask
if she was okay?

23:01.142 --> 23:02.908
She was really upset

23:02.910 --> 23:05.478
when she came in
to tell me she was quitting.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.313
Why was she so upset?

23:07.315 --> 23:10.583
She didn't say why.

23:10.585 --> 23:12.251
But you have an idea?

23:18.025 --> 23:20.493
Christiano raped her.

23:33.341 --> 23:34.607
So how's your arm, Uncle Danny?

23:34.609 --> 23:36.509
I heard you got attacked
by a Rottweiler.

23:36.511 --> 23:38.043
Oh, my arm's fine.

23:38.045 --> 23:42.081
And the only Rottweiler causing
me any pain is my new C.O.

23:42.083 --> 23:43.315
Carver's a good cop.

23:43.317 --> 23:44.650
Carver is a
ball buster.

23:44.652 --> 23:47.153
Carver is a good, tough cop.

23:47.155 --> 23:50.656
District Attorney McCoy
is a ball buster.

23:50.658 --> 23:52.091
Language please.

23:52.093 --> 23:53.159
Gentlemen.

23:53.161 --> 23:54.193
Sorry.

23:54.195 --> 23:56.061
That morning
show should have

23:56.063 --> 23:58.230
you two as regulars--
be a big hit.

23:58.232 --> 23:59.765
No, thanks.

23:59.767 --> 24:01.367
Nothing scientific,
but I'd be willing to bet

24:01.369 --> 24:04.236
my precinct shows record-high
pot collars this week.

24:04.238 --> 24:05.638
And I'll bet

24:05.640 --> 24:09.074
every precinct in all five
boroughs does the same thing.

24:09.076 --> 24:11.377
Yeah, but I'm not looking
for that either.

24:11.379 --> 24:12.711
Still a nice vote of confidence
from the troops though.

24:12.713 --> 24:14.313
Yeah.

24:14.315 --> 24:16.549
This whole thing got blown
out of proportion,

24:16.551 --> 24:19.385
which is exactly
what McCoy was looking for.

24:19.387 --> 24:20.452
That's not fair.

24:20.454 --> 24:22.521
He was just voicing
a different point of view.

24:22.523 --> 24:23.689
What a rebel.

24:23.691 --> 24:25.524
You know, I
shouldn't have

24:25.526 --> 24:28.460
to be talking to you about
the broken windows theory.

24:28.462 --> 24:29.628
What's the broken

24:29.630 --> 24:30.763
windows theory?

24:30.765 --> 24:32.331
Well, if one window
in a building

24:32.333 --> 24:33.966
gets broken, the rest
will probably get broken,

24:33.968 --> 24:35.334
because then

24:35.336 --> 24:37.703
people are gonna see it and
think you can get away with it,

24:37.705 --> 24:39.438
and then the problem
gets worse and worse.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.307
Whoa. Nice, Jack.

24:41.309 --> 24:42.775
But who wants all
these broken windows?

24:42.777 --> 24:43.876
It's based on the idea

24:43.878 --> 24:45.945
that disorder leads to crime,
and order

24:45.947 --> 24:47.947
- makes people accountable.
- Does it work?

24:47.949 --> 24:50.883
Yeah, son. It has been
proven to reduce crime.

24:50.885 --> 24:53.319
You start ignoring
smaller crimes,

24:53.321 --> 24:54.987
you end up with bigger ones.

24:54.989 --> 24:57.122
How does putting a joint
in your pocket

24:57.124 --> 24:58.991
lead to disorder and crime?

24:58.993 --> 25:01.861
Do you smoke pot?

25:03.431 --> 25:05.264
Do you?

25:05.266 --> 25:08.667
No.

25:08.669 --> 25:10.569
And why not?

25:10.571 --> 25:14.240
Look at the crowd
I eat Sunday dinner with.

25:15.576 --> 25:17.309
And it's against the law.

25:17.311 --> 25:18.777
Yes.

25:18.779 --> 25:20.512
And that is exactly the point.

25:20.514 --> 25:22.114
It is against the law.

25:22.116 --> 25:23.949
And the moment
they repeal the law,

25:23.951 --> 25:25.885
cops will stop
arresting you for it.

25:25.887 --> 25:27.286
Until then, they will.

25:27.288 --> 25:28.487
Right.

25:28.489 --> 25:30.589
Anybody having trouble
understanding that?

25:30.591 --> 25:31.824
Nope.

25:31.826 --> 25:33.525
Everybody understands
it, Dad, even McCoy.

25:33.527 --> 25:35.194
He was just...

25:35.196 --> 25:38.197
He was just grandstanding
on national television.

25:38.199 --> 25:41.066
He is new to this and should be
allowed a learning curve.

25:42.336 --> 25:45.404
Anybody having trouble
understanding that?

26:02.123 --> 26:03.123
Making yourself at home?

26:04.225 --> 26:06.225
I love orchids.

26:06.227 --> 26:07.760
I don't think that thing
will survive this place.

26:07.762 --> 26:10.663
People used to say
the same thing about me.

26:10.665 --> 26:12.131
Hmm.

26:12.133 --> 26:13.832
We caught a break.

26:13.834 --> 26:15.701
D.O.C. sent over
a recording

26:15.703 --> 26:18.203
of Juan Ramos's
jailhouse phone chatter

26:18.205 --> 26:20.105
with one of his soldiers.

26:20.107 --> 26:21.807
You serious?

26:21.809 --> 26:23.776
Cops find out,
that's heavy time.

26:23.778 --> 26:25.945
I don't give a crap.

26:25.947 --> 26:29.148
I want the bitch
and the baby dead.

26:29.150 --> 26:30.783
Not too smart.

26:30.785 --> 26:32.251
We don't catch the smart ones.

26:32.253 --> 26:33.619
I put a gang unit on it.

26:33.621 --> 26:36.221
DNA test came back,
by the way.

26:36.223 --> 26:38.090
Baby's father--

26:38.092 --> 26:40.893
your pal Rudy Williams.

26:40.895 --> 26:43.062
Let's track him down.

26:47.702 --> 26:50.602
You gave me a rip
for not being clean shaven.

26:50.604 --> 26:54.473
I should have given you a rip
for insubordination.

26:54.475 --> 26:57.042
I went for the lesser charge.

26:57.044 --> 26:58.911
Yeah, well, maybe you should
have went for insubordination,

26:58.913 --> 27:00.913
'cause I don't plan on shaving
anytime soon.

27:00.915 --> 27:05.017
I won't have you openly
questioning every move I make.

27:05.019 --> 27:08.153
Well, you won't have to worry
about that much longer.

27:08.155 --> 27:09.955
What is it?

27:09.957 --> 27:12.758
See for yourself.

27:14.028 --> 27:16.028
A 57?

27:16.030 --> 27:17.696
You want a transfer?

27:17.698 --> 27:18.998
As soon as the case is closed.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.199
Why?

27:20.201 --> 27:21.900
Why?

27:21.902 --> 27:23.702
You're a good cop.

27:23.704 --> 27:26.438
Damn good at what you do,
but so am I.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.173
And I'm not changing

27:28.175 --> 27:30.943
the way I do things
just to suit you.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.775
I need a moment.
For?

27:54.777 --> 27:56.944
This just came to me.

28:00.850 --> 28:01.915
Listen?

28:03.853 --> 28:05.752
"During my appearance

28:05.754 --> 28:08.789
"on <i> CBS This Morning</i>
a couple of days ago,

28:08.791 --> 28:11.358
"I made some remarks
in the heat of the moment

28:11.360 --> 28:12.759
"that, in hindsight,

28:12.761 --> 28:14.928
could be considered
disrespectful to the office..."

28:14.930 --> 28:16.430
Stop.

28:16.432 --> 28:17.231
What?

28:17.233 --> 28:19.233
I'm not apologizing.

28:19.235 --> 28:22.936
I don't care
how artfully you write it.

28:26.242 --> 28:27.641
I'm just not.

28:27.643 --> 28:32.012
"...disrespectful to the office
of the police commissioner,

28:32.014 --> 28:33.247
"Frank Reagan.

28:33.249 --> 28:34.948
I am new to this job..."

28:34.950 --> 28:36.416
Let me see that.

28:44.460 --> 28:46.393
Where'd you get this?

28:46.395 --> 28:49.296
From my counterpart
in the D.A.'s office.

28:49.298 --> 28:51.098
It's a transcript
of the opening remarks

28:51.100 --> 28:54.034
McCoy is making at his press
conference this afternoon.

28:57.439 --> 28:59.540
Oh.

28:59.542 --> 29:02.042
Just thought you'd like to know.

29:03.946 --> 29:05.746
Hold on a second.

29:13.656 --> 29:17.658
If a man finds himself feeling,

29:17.660 --> 29:20.494
deep into his life's work,

29:20.496 --> 29:23.096
that the surprises in that work,

29:23.098 --> 29:26.900
say... challenges
to his judgment,

29:26.902 --> 29:32.372
no longer galvanize
and energize him...

29:32.374 --> 29:37.311
but only irritate him
and drain him...

29:41.383 --> 29:44.985
If that starts to happen,

29:44.987 --> 29:48.655
is it the sign
that it's time to go?

29:50.459 --> 29:53.760
That feels like a trick question
on about five different levels.

29:54.630 --> 29:56.863
It's not.

29:56.865 --> 30:00.400
Is it your way of apologizing?

30:00.402 --> 30:04.371
No, it is my way
of asking your opinion

30:04.373 --> 30:07.541
on the hypothetical
I just laid out.

30:12.047 --> 30:14.014
Maybe.

30:14.016 --> 30:16.283
Anything else?

30:20.456 --> 30:22.422
Yes.

30:22.424 --> 30:24.491
Why don't you talk
to your counterpart

30:24.493 --> 30:27.261
and see if Mr. McCoy
would like to meet.

30:27.263 --> 30:28.895
Okay.

30:28.897 --> 30:30.464
One-on-one, no cameras.

30:30.466 --> 30:32.099
Will do.

30:39.341 --> 30:41.508
Thank you, Garrett.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.200
Rudy?

31:07.202 --> 31:09.636
You home, Rudy?

31:11.840 --> 31:14.641
Rudy, it's
Detective Reagan

31:14.643 --> 31:16.043
and Lieutenant Carver.

31:16.045 --> 31:18.045
We just want
to talk to you.

31:30.426 --> 31:32.192
How you doing there, Rudy?

31:34.463 --> 31:37.164
Gun.

31:37.166 --> 31:39.099
What do you want
to do about it?

31:39.101 --> 31:41.535
Rudy?

31:41.537 --> 31:45.038
You know, this thing
still smells like her.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.306
You know,

31:46.308 --> 31:51.144
you're the only one left
who can take care of her.

31:51.146 --> 31:52.813
I-I can't take care of her.

31:52.815 --> 31:54.381
Yes, you can.

31:54.383 --> 31:57.184
Rudy, put the gun down.

31:58.354 --> 32:02.122
It's my fault her mom's dead.

32:03.559 --> 32:05.225
You didn't kill her.

32:05.227 --> 32:06.526
Might as well have.

32:06.528 --> 32:09.696
You start
screwing around with

32:09.698 --> 32:11.932
a drug dealer's girlfriend,

32:11.934 --> 32:13.934
what'd you think
is gonna happen?

32:15.137 --> 32:18.171
You-you got to think
about Joy, now.

32:19.675 --> 32:22.843
What kind of life
is she gonna have with me?

32:22.845 --> 32:26.380
She's gonna have a life with
a father who loves her, Rudy.

32:26.382 --> 32:29.316
I stick around,
she'll end up like me.

32:29.318 --> 32:30.784
Rudy, if you stick around,

32:30.786 --> 32:34.521
your baby girl's got a shot
at a better life than you.

32:34.523 --> 32:38.225
Only one way to give her
a better life.

32:39.261 --> 32:40.861
Don't do it, Rudy.

32:40.863 --> 32:42.195
You don't want to do it.

32:42.197 --> 32:43.997
Don't do it, Rudy.

32:43.999 --> 32:45.799
Don't do this, Rudy.

32:45.801 --> 32:47.067
Put that down.

32:48.504 --> 32:49.703
Tell her I loved her.

32:49.705 --> 32:51.405
Don't! No!

32:51.407 --> 32:53.473
No!

33:27.209 --> 33:30.210
He was afraid that she'd
go to the cops about the rape,

33:30.212 --> 33:31.978
so he killed her.

33:31.980 --> 33:33.280
Staged it
to look like

33:33.282 --> 33:34.748
a suicide.

33:34.750 --> 33:36.583
He confessed to the rape,
and then,

33:36.585 --> 33:38.385
eventually, to the murder.

33:42.291 --> 33:44.991
I don't know
how to thank you.

33:44.993 --> 33:47.260
You don't need to thank us.

33:47.262 --> 33:49.796
When Rose was born,
I promised myself

33:49.798 --> 33:51.832
I'd do everything
humanly possible

33:51.834 --> 33:53.767
to give her a good life.

33:53.769 --> 33:56.870
It would've
destroyed me if...

33:56.872 --> 33:59.606
I thought I had failed her.

34:01.009 --> 34:03.477
Just a second.

34:13.188 --> 34:16.656
The last thing we were
gonna do together.

34:16.658 --> 34:18.592
I'd like you to use them.

34:18.594 --> 34:19.960
For <i> Wicked.</i>

34:19.962 --> 34:22.094
Oh. Oh, no, no,
we couldn't.

34:22.097 --> 34:25.031
It would make me so happy
if the two of you would

34:25.033 --> 34:28.435
take them, and I know
Rose would want it, too.

34:29.972 --> 34:31.638
Please.

34:31.639 --> 34:34.074
Come on.

34:38.614 --> 34:41.781
Okay. Thank you.

34:41.783 --> 34:44.684
No.

34:44.686 --> 34:47.087
Thank you.

34:51.126 --> 34:53.393
At least we brought her
some closure.

34:53.395 --> 34:55.562
And got an A-1
felony collar to boot.

34:55.563 --> 34:58.632
Yeah, but if it turned out that
she really did commit suicide,

34:58.634 --> 35:01.601
it'd be a different
story. You know?

35:01.603 --> 35:04.170
Might not be celebrating-- you'd
be looking for another partner.

35:04.172 --> 35:05.539
Never.

35:05.541 --> 35:07.374
I need you for dating advice.

35:07.376 --> 35:08.842
Yeah, did you ever
answer that guy

35:08.844 --> 35:10.377
that broke up with
you over text?

35:10.379 --> 35:12.145
No. Last text
I got from him,

35:12.147 --> 35:13.747
he wanted to know
if I'd be willing

35:13.749 --> 35:15.682
to keep dating him,
just not exclusively.

35:15.684 --> 35:16.716
What?

35:16.718 --> 35:18.685
Give me that.
Hey.

35:18.687 --> 35:19.986
Hey, Reagan...
Let me see this.

35:19.988 --> 35:21.821
Give me my phone back.
Give me the phone.

35:21.823 --> 35:23.523
Give me my phone, Reagan.
What are you doing?!

35:23.525 --> 35:25.559
Wait.
Give me my phone!

35:25.561 --> 35:27.527
Okay, all right, okay.
Give me my phone.

35:27.529 --> 35:29.863
Okay.
What did you do?

35:31.667 --> 35:32.999
"It's over and it's your loss."

35:33.001 --> 35:34.568
You sent that?

35:34.570 --> 35:37.837
I'm only doing the guy a favor.

35:39.875 --> 35:41.942
You know what, it is his loss.

35:41.944 --> 35:44.411
I'm a catch.

35:44.413 --> 35:46.513
Yeah.

35:46.515 --> 35:48.181
Not to mention demanding.

35:48.183 --> 35:49.549
Demand... What did you say?

35:49.551 --> 35:50.817
When?

35:50.819 --> 35:52.786
"Shemanding."
What?

35:52.788 --> 35:55.155
"Shemanding." Pretty sure
that's the word you said,

35:55.157 --> 35:57.324
'cause it wasn't "demanding"
'cause that's not what I am.

36:00.062 --> 36:03.997
Little baby. Look at those feet.

36:04.666 --> 36:06.900
God.

36:06.902 --> 36:09.769
She cried a lot the first day.

36:09.771 --> 36:12.172
She seemed scared,
but I think

36:12.174 --> 36:13.807
she's gotten used to us.

36:13.809 --> 36:14.975
Yeah, she is.

36:14.977 --> 36:16.977
You have any luck
finding the relatives?

36:16.979 --> 36:18.745
Afraid not.

36:18.747 --> 36:21.114
How's it work when that happens?

36:21.116 --> 36:23.083
She'll be put in foster care
indefinitely,

36:23.085 --> 36:26.219
until someone comes forward with
an application for adoption.

36:26.221 --> 36:27.487
How long does that usually take?

36:27.489 --> 36:29.289
Oh, what?

36:29.291 --> 36:30.924
The average child
stays about two years

36:30.926 --> 36:32.158
before they're adopted.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.628
Two years?

36:34.630 --> 36:37.697
Well, this little one's lucky.

36:37.699 --> 36:38.865
What do you mean?

36:38.867 --> 36:41.935
Think I can let you in
on a little secret.

36:41.937 --> 36:43.837
We've already had a request

36:43.839 --> 36:46.339
from someone
inside the department.

36:46.341 --> 36:47.574
You're kidding me.

36:47.576 --> 36:49.209
Lieutenant Carver.

36:49.211 --> 36:52.078
She came in here last night
and started the paperwork.

36:57.452 --> 37:00.186
Wow.

37:08.630 --> 37:11.765
24 hours, and my orchid's
still alive.

37:11.767 --> 37:13.967
Think that's a good sign.

37:13.969 --> 37:17.537
I don't really like things that
are high maintenance, myself.

37:17.539 --> 37:19.105
Me either.

37:19.107 --> 37:22.075
But sometimes they're worth
all the trouble.

37:22.077 --> 37:24.310
I thought you'd gone
for the evening.

37:24.312 --> 37:27.547
I had a few loose ends
to tie up,

37:27.549 --> 37:31.818
and I wanted to, uh,
check in on Joy.

37:31.820 --> 37:33.486
How is she?

37:33.488 --> 37:35.288
She's good.

37:35.290 --> 37:37.791
None of her
family members

37:37.793 --> 37:39.626
came to claim her.

37:39.628 --> 37:42.629
Oh.

37:42.631 --> 37:44.964
That's too bad.

37:46.802 --> 37:49.836
When I was a kid,
my old man and my grandfather

37:49.838 --> 37:53.673
used to tell me
all their cop stories.

37:56.411 --> 37:58.778
Somewhere around age eight
or nine, I just decided

37:58.780 --> 38:01.347
I really didn't want
to hear them anymore.

38:03.051 --> 38:05.318
I decided I'd rather be
the guy out there

38:05.320 --> 38:08.254
making my own cop stories.

38:08.256 --> 38:10.924
That's why I became a cop.

38:14.162 --> 38:16.863
Anyway, you asked
why I became a cop, and...

38:16.865 --> 38:19.466
now you know.

38:20.302 --> 38:22.736
Delightful.

38:26.408 --> 38:27.807
Um...

38:27.809 --> 38:30.543
That's what
the "Dee" stands for.

38:30.545 --> 38:34.013
Delightful.

38:37.552 --> 38:39.252
Huh.

38:44.693 --> 38:47.360
Did you sign off on my 57 yet?

38:47.362 --> 38:48.928
Not yet.

38:48.930 --> 38:52.332
Good. 'Cause I was thinking
I'm gonna hold off on that.

38:52.334 --> 38:54.734
Really?

38:54.736 --> 38:56.202
Yeah.

38:56.204 --> 38:59.439
I was hoping to get rid of you.

38:59.441 --> 39:03.343
Well, I thought it'd be
a better idea if I stayed,

39:03.345 --> 39:06.179
hung around
and drove you so crazy

39:06.181 --> 39:09.382
that you'd put in
for a transfer instead.

39:09.384 --> 39:13.153
Don't play chicken with me.
I don't back down.

39:13.155 --> 39:16.489
Well, then I guess
we do have something in common,

39:16.491 --> 39:18.558
'cause I don't back down either.

39:22.264 --> 39:24.464
Good night, boss.

39:42.784 --> 39:44.350
This mine?

39:44.352 --> 39:46.586
Yup. It's loaded.

39:49.014 --> 39:50.580
You using live bait?

39:50.922 --> 39:54.024
Cocahoe minnows on
a half-ounce lead.

39:54.026 --> 39:56.826
Seems a bit light
for that current.

39:56.828 --> 39:59.996
I think I'm good
at gauging the current.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.198
Yes, you are.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.870
You're using braided line?

40:06.872 --> 40:09.572
Are you going to
second-guess everything?

40:09.574 --> 40:11.775
Nope.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.944
I know what I'm doing.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.783
I know you do.

40:22.654 --> 40:25.588
Hear you and the D.A.
had a meeting.

40:25.590 --> 40:28.324
We did.

40:29.995 --> 40:32.595
He's a really good man
once you get to know him.

40:32.597 --> 40:35.732
He is ten years too old for
that brash young firebrand act.

40:35.734 --> 40:39.436
With him, it comes with a
big whiff of calculation.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.638
He's trying to make amends, Dad.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.507
Well, I still
don't like him.

40:44.509 --> 40:46.176
You know, I don't think
you've ever liked anyone

40:46.178 --> 40:47.677
I've gone out with.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.112
That's not true.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.680
Name one.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.948
Christopher McCormick.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.484
Chr...

40:54.486 --> 40:57.020
He broke up with
me, by the way.

40:58.123 --> 41:00.056
Yeah, he did.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.858
It's too bad.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.793
I liked him.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.762
I don't think anyone

41:05.764 --> 41:08.932
could live up
to your expectations.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.904
You do.
