00:02.708 --> 00:03.912
A man's been found,

00:03.924 --> 00:05.558
shot through the back
of the head

00:05.579 --> 00:07.134
with a low-velocity round.

00:07.456 --> 00:10.385
<i>The murder weapon</i>
<i>was used two days later</i>

00:10.387 --> 00:12.142
<i>to kill a Marine in Idaho.</i>

00:12.144 --> 00:14.236
Our Red Team's already
on the ground.

00:14.238 --> 00:16.997
They work, travel,
sleep together.

00:16.999 --> 00:18.370
<i>It's basically like living on</i>
<i>a submarine.</i>

00:18.372 --> 00:20.045
<i>Meet our boss,</i>
<i>Paris Summerskill.</i>

00:20.047 --> 00:21.804
Callen...
heard a lot about you.

00:21.806 --> 00:24.231
Special Agent Claire Keats...
Hi.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.771
Dave Flynn...
Hey.

00:25.773 --> 00:26.960
and Kai.
Thank you, sir.

00:26.962 --> 00:28.751
<i>Spears and his terrorist cell</i>

00:28.753 --> 00:30.727
<i>are our priority.</i>

00:30.729 --> 00:32.519
Both vehicles,
let's load them up.

00:34.328 --> 00:37.675
<i>Four dead,</i>
<i>one slightly injured.</i>

00:37.677 --> 00:39.300
<i>Spears got away.</i>

00:39.302 --> 00:41.359
<i>Roy is going to be filling in.</i>

00:41.361 --> 00:42.531
You good with that?

00:45.830 --> 00:47.637
Why'd you offer me this?

00:47.639 --> 00:49.429
Why did you accept?

00:50.970 --> 00:51.572
Roy!

00:53.281 --> 00:55.624
Where were you?

00:55.626 --> 00:57.566
Redemption.

00:57.568 --> 01:02.455
Mr. Callen, interrogate
the surviving terrorist.

01:02.457 --> 01:04.965
Ms. Summerskill, get your team
down to El Centro.

01:04.968 --> 01:07.310
Find Robert Spears.

01:07.312 --> 01:09.185
And, Ms. Summerskill,

01:09.187 --> 01:12.650
you're still a man down.

01:17.207 --> 01:18.947
You should take
another look at the report

01:18.949 --> 01:21.793
on Roy's shooting;
refresh your memory.

01:24.540 --> 01:29.026
You know, I never did find
out who redacted that report.

01:32.040 --> 01:37.095
A lot of unanswered questions
about that night, Henrietta.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.712
And a few buried secrets.

01:40.714 --> 01:44.931
Will he ever trust her?

01:44.933 --> 01:48.782
I think the question is, Owen,

01:48.784 --> 01:52.684
will Paris ever trust herself?

Me and the trucks

02:26.423 --> 02:27.877
It feels good

02:27.879 --> 02:29.769
Yeah, and tomorrow we'll be
sweating our asses off

02:29.771 --> 02:32.347
wishing we were someplace cool,
like Idaho.

You didn't
like the Bahamas?

I love the Bahamas.

All right, I'm just saying,

we never stay in one

Okay, Kai, we've got to--
We really got to get these--

02:46.380 --> 02:48.588
Look-look, I got it.
All right?

02:48.590 --> 02:51.099
And I don't need to be told
twice and at the same time.

FBI, Border Protection and
State Police contact details.

03:00.779 --> 03:02.083
And all of you,

03:02.085 --> 03:04.293
you still need to sign Danny's
get well card.

03:04.295 --> 03:07.005

03:12.196 --> 03:14.372
Okay, I got Laverne.

03:21.757 --> 03:23.632
This could
get difficult.

03:23.634 --> 03:24.770
Which one do we salute?

03:24.772 --> 03:25.925
Paris.

03:25.927 --> 03:27.783
No, no. Roy's senior.

03:27.785 --> 03:30.128
Paris used to work for him
before he was shot.

03:30.130 --> 03:32.002
He's an analyst, she's an agent.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.157
That puts Paris in charge.

03:33.159 --> 03:34.598
Theoretically.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.875
It's not theoretical,
it's practical.

03:36.877 --> 03:38.114
Paris is boss.

03:38.116 --> 03:39.989
Has anybody told him?

03:39.991 --> 03:42.769
Probably not.

03:42.771 --> 03:44.728
You're right;
this could get difficult.

03:44.730 --> 03:47.523
Mm-hmm.
Mmm! Does this contain nuts?

03:47.525 --> 03:49.466
You don't have
a nut allergy, Dave.

03:49.468 --> 03:51.475
I-I think my glands
are swollen.

03:51.477 --> 03:52.512
Do I look puffy?

03:52.514 --> 03:54.773
You always look puffy, Dave.
Do I...?

04:03.531 --> 04:06.945
Your friends are dead,
Ari; you're alive.

04:06.947 --> 04:10.562
You got
nothing to lose.

04:10.564 --> 04:12.320
So why don't you
tell us about Spears.

04:18.331 --> 04:20.607
He is the one you fear.

04:22.299 --> 04:26.802
With his yellow hair
and white skin.

04:26.804 --> 04:29.816
He is the man that
you pass on the street,

04:29.818 --> 04:32.612
the man who sits
beside you on the train;

04:32.614 --> 04:37.016
serves you coffee,
serves you popcorn.

04:37.018 --> 04:39.727
Kneels besides
you at church.

04:39.729 --> 04:42.909
Kisses your daughter.

04:42.911 --> 04:44.918
He is the one you hate

04:44.920 --> 04:47.681
because he <i>is</i> you.

04:47.683 --> 04:51.364
The future of
the Holy Jihad.

04:51.366 --> 04:54.880
A white Muslim.

04:54.882 --> 04:59.317
And one day,
there will be 10,000 Spears

04:59.319 --> 05:01.544
aimed at your heart.

05:01.546 --> 05:05.713
And your CIA will not
know friend from foe.

05:05.715 --> 05:09.664
And America and
the West will crumble.

05:09.666 --> 05:13.599
And Allah will be triumphant.

05:13.601 --> 05:14.921
While Spears
is still out there,

05:14.923 --> 05:16.696
Ari's not going
to give us anything.

05:16.698 --> 05:20.446
Ari thinks
Spears got away.

05:20.448 --> 05:23.008
Well, small point,
but he did get away.

05:24.483 --> 05:26.842
Did he?

05:26.844 --> 05:31.346
Do you want to tell him,
or should I?

05:31.348 --> 05:33.305
You tell him.

05:35.868 --> 05:37.692
Spears is dead.

05:39.703 --> 05:42.514
I don't believe you.

05:42.516 --> 05:46.247
I saw him escape
with my own eyes.

05:46.249 --> 05:48.457
Killed an hour ago in El Centro.

05:48.459 --> 05:49.797
Betrayed by the man
who smuggled him

05:49.799 --> 05:51.806
across the border from Mexico.

05:54.787 --> 05:55.824
It's not true.

05:55.826 --> 05:57.968
You know it is.

05:57.970 --> 06:00.395
You know he crossed the border
at El Centro.

06:00.397 --> 06:02.320
I'm guessing you even know
the name of the man

06:02.322 --> 06:03.643
who helped smuggle him.

06:04.816 --> 06:08.548
If what you say is true,

06:08.550 --> 06:11.111
then Allah will take his revenge
on this man.

06:11.113 --> 06:14.459
Let us be Allah's instrument.

06:16.302 --> 06:18.644
Tell us this man's name.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.704
By telling us,

06:20.706 --> 06:23.283
you will avenge Spears.

06:26.414 --> 06:30.281
His name is José Ramirez.

06:33.966 --> 06:37.648
And game.

06:43.426 --> 06:44.713
Paris, you in position?

06:44.715 --> 06:46.187
Yeah, we're just setting up.

06:46.189 --> 06:47.979
We'll get right on it.

06:49.737 --> 06:51.829
Ari Sayed
gave us a name:

06:51.831 --> 06:53.972
José Ramirez.

07:15.906 --> 07:17.864
Ramirez is a
Mexican-born U.S. citizen

07:17.866 --> 07:20.660
who lives here in El Centro.

07:20.662 --> 07:23.205
He specializes in
smuggling people and weapons

07:23.207 --> 07:24.780
across the border.

07:24.782 --> 07:26.236
Every time the Border Patrol
gets close to Ramirez,

07:26.238 --> 07:27.458
people start dying.

07:27.460 --> 07:29.668
Usually informants
or witnesses.

07:33.403 --> 07:37.001
Okay, he's got a ranch...
ten miles out of town.

07:37.003 --> 07:38.425
Got a plan?

07:38.427 --> 07:39.681
We're going
to check it out.

07:39.683 --> 07:42.276
Maybe you can work up
some local intel on Ramirez.

07:42.278 --> 07:43.732
Got it.

07:43.734 --> 07:46.042
Only one road in.

07:46.044 --> 07:47.282
Ramirez's ranch.

07:47.284 --> 07:48.923
Yeah.

07:48.925 --> 07:50.764
Just be careful.

07:59.037 --> 08:01.446
Three cars.

08:01.448 --> 08:04.242
Five, six, may--
at least seven guys.

08:04.244 --> 08:05.917
High ground, a lot of buildings.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.707
And Roy's right,
only one road in or out.

08:07.709 --> 08:09.717
Hard to attack,
easy to defend.

08:09.719 --> 08:10.883
Heads up,
they're on the move.

08:12.899 --> 08:14.372
And they are
not messing around.

08:14.374 --> 08:16.247
Have they seen us?
Too far.

08:16.249 --> 08:18.256
Well, something's
got them spooked.

08:18.258 --> 08:20.533
Here comes the man
himself-- Ramirez.

08:30.915 --> 08:31.834
They are coming out hot.

08:31.836 --> 08:32.839
We've got to move, now.

08:32.841 --> 08:34.328
Oh, crap.

08:51.090 --> 08:52.964
Here they come.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.173
I think we've been made.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.517
How could they have made us,
we just got here.

09:08.954 --> 09:10.544
I think we're good.

09:17.712 --> 09:19.635
Gun!

09:52.519 --> 09:53.203
Drop your weapon!

09:53.876 --> 09:54.963
Drop it!

09:54.965 --> 09:56.587
Dave, how's your Spanish?

09:58.816 --> 10:00.991
Uh... <i>el...</i>

10:02.733 --> 10:05.243
What'd you say
to him, Dave?

10:05.245 --> 10:06.935
Ask him out on a date?

10:18.793 --> 10:20.851
<i>El Centro.</i>

10:20.853 --> 10:23.613
One more pin in the map.

10:23.615 --> 10:26.092
Hey...

10:26.094 --> 10:28.313
Another head shot.

10:28.314 --> 10:29.652
Paris.

10:29.654 --> 10:31.360
She shot the bodyguard
in the head.

10:31.362 --> 10:33.335
Yeah, we're-we're trained
to shoot for the body mass--

10:33.337 --> 10:35.596
you know, the torso,
it's a bigger target--

10:35.598 --> 10:36.600
she takes a head shot.

10:36.602 --> 10:38.224
Circumstance,
spur of the moment.

10:38.226 --> 10:39.229
No, no, no.

10:39.231 --> 10:40.434
What-what-what about
the guy in Memphis

10:40.436 --> 10:41.957
with the
homemade flamethrower?

10:41.959 --> 10:43.079
Head shot.

10:43.081 --> 10:44.720
That messed-up
cartel gunfight we got into

10:44.722 --> 10:45.725
in New Mexico.

10:45.727 --> 10:47.466
Two guys, both head shots.

10:47.468 --> 10:49.107
Is this going anywhere?

10:49.109 --> 10:50.530
No.

10:50.532 --> 10:51.702
Just curious.

10:51.704 --> 10:53.828
Curiosity
killed the cat, Dave.

10:53.830 --> 10:55.385
Probably a head shot.

10:55.387 --> 10:57.394
Oh, you took your time.

10:57.396 --> 10:59.538
Yeah, I've been drinking tequila
with the county sheriff.

10:59.540 --> 11:01.195
He's a little upset he hadn't
been told

11:01.197 --> 11:02.719
we were in his jurisdiction.

11:02.721 --> 11:04.092
Well, we sent an e-mail.

11:04.094 --> 11:05.816
I was just...
Pay him a courtesy call.

11:05.818 --> 11:09.231
I told him you were on the way
when we got the Ramirez intel.

11:09.233 --> 11:10.404
Any sign of him?

11:10.406 --> 11:11.927
Nah.
My drinking buddy thinks

11:11.929 --> 11:14.104
he hightailed it down to Mexico.

11:14.106 --> 11:16.197
Might be something
on this, Dave.

11:16.199 --> 11:18.876
Cool. Homework.
How'd you get it?

11:18.878 --> 11:21.303
Oh, Sheriff Drunky
let me download the GPS data

11:21.305 --> 11:22.509
from the wreck.

11:22.511 --> 11:25.271
Hey, whose turn is it
to cook dinner?

11:32.472 --> 11:34.363
Me?

11:36.122 --> 11:38.046
Yeah.

11:38.048 --> 11:40.055
Yeah, I can, uh...

11:40.057 --> 11:42.316
...can cook.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.870
Pizza counts, right?

12:00.064 --> 12:02.654
Do you want to tell
me this story over

12:02.680 --> 12:04.502
a cup of tea, Owen...

12:05.206 --> 12:07.548
or should I break
out the scotch?

12:19.737 --> 12:24.626
Five years ago, I was part
of a joint FBI task force.

12:24.628 --> 12:27.137
Bobby-Lee Wilson
was a whistle-blower.

12:27.139 --> 12:29.397
We had him
under witness protection,

12:29.399 --> 12:32.829
but he was murdered before
he could give his testimony.

12:32.831 --> 12:36.681
Shot in the back of the head
with a low-velocity round?

12:36.683 --> 12:38.773
Yeah, he was in the next room.

12:38.775 --> 12:41.251
Shooter used a pillow
to muffle the sound.

12:41.253 --> 12:44.047
We still don't know
how he got past us.

12:44.049 --> 12:46.508
Kept me awake
at night for months.

12:47.614 --> 12:50.242
Well, your shooter
has a face now.

12:51.716 --> 12:54.428
Well, if it's the same man.

12:54.430 --> 12:59.283
If we were to believe what
Ari Sayed told Callen and Sam,

12:59.285 --> 13:02.800
Spears is a fundamentalist
driven by his ideology.

13:02.802 --> 13:05.528
So what's he doing working
as a contract killer

13:05.530 --> 13:07.906
five years ago?
Mm.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.120
Eric?

13:11.958 --> 13:14.268
A data search.

13:14.270 --> 13:15.323
All states.

13:15.325 --> 13:18.453
Go back five years;
unsolved murders.

13:18.455 --> 13:20.764
All the victims shot
in the back of the head

13:20.766 --> 13:22.672
with a low-velocity round.

13:22.674 --> 13:24.280
Got it.

13:25.621 --> 13:29.169
Can't have you
losing sleep, Owen.

13:52.979 --> 13:55.489
That's another five
dollars you owe me.

13:55.491 --> 13:57.431
No, no.
No, I worked all night,

13:57.433 --> 13:59.859
on-on Roy's GPS stuff.
Wait, what's it up to?

13:59.861 --> 14:01.366
Fifty-five.

14:01.368 --> 14:03.543
You-you know,
I never agreed to the whole

14:03.545 --> 14:06.054
"morning run challenge" thing.
It was just one time.

14:06.056 --> 14:07.376
It was a...

14:07.378 --> 14:08.900
one-time thing.

14:08.902 --> 14:09.854
You awake?

14:09.856 --> 14:12.048
Now I am.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.676
Hundred and five, right?

14:14.678 --> 14:16.099
Hundred and ten.

14:16.101 --> 14:17.188
Dock my pay.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.067
Already have.

14:21.073 --> 14:22.161
How far?

14:24.505 --> 14:25.810
Five miles.

14:25.812 --> 14:28.004
Used to be ten.

14:32.626 --> 14:34.667
I hate this bathroom.

14:34.669 --> 14:36.694
Kai?
Roy.

14:38.988 --> 14:41.298
Okay, Roy, Paris
and then me

14:41.300 --> 14:42.837
in the shower--
don't even think

14:42.840 --> 14:44.546
about it, Dave,
or I'll shoot you.

14:44.548 --> 14:45.936
Good to know.

14:45.938 --> 14:48.614
You find anything from the
GPS data Roy gave you?

14:48.616 --> 14:50.238
Yes. Okay.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.465
Uh, multiple trips every day.

14:52.467 --> 14:54.474
Mostly in and around El Centro.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.287
Now, first trip every day
is always in the same location.

14:57.289 --> 14:59.464
Ramirez's ranch.
Right. Which is also

14:59.466 --> 15:01.004
the final destination every day.

15:01.006 --> 15:03.817
And in between?
Well, the second most visited location

15:03.819 --> 15:06.110
is a place up on the Salton Sea.

15:06.112 --> 15:09.041
At least one return trip
a day, every day.

15:09.043 --> 15:10.162
Worth checking out.

15:10.164 --> 15:13.076
Where, exactly?
Place called Bombay Beach.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.202
Mm. Sounds exotic.

15:15.204 --> 15:16.993
Yeah, it's
exotic, all right.

15:16.995 --> 15:19.254
I wouldn't be
packing my bikini.

15:19.256 --> 15:22.184
I-I mean, your bikini.

15:22.186 --> 15:24.997
I mean, not that I would actually
be packing your bikini.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.420
That would be weird.

15:26.422 --> 15:28.244
You done?

15:28.246 --> 15:30.605
I'm done.
Don't shoot me.

15:36.617 --> 15:38.089
Bam!

15:38.091 --> 15:39.178
Is that for me?

15:39.180 --> 15:41.405
And Kensi.

15:41.407 --> 15:42.911
From?

15:42.913 --> 15:44.485
Hetty Lange.

15:44.487 --> 15:45.541
That looks bad.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.348
Very bad.
How bad?

15:47.350 --> 15:50.345
Well, 117 unsolved murder cases

15:50.347 --> 15:52.706
from across the U.S.
where the victim

15:52.708 --> 15:55.837
was shot in the head
with a low-velocity round.

15:55.839 --> 15:59.185
I don't want that.
This puppy's got five years worth.

15:59.187 --> 16:02.451
Hetty wants you to sift
through the files and look

16:02.453 --> 16:04.041
for common denominators.

16:04.043 --> 16:05.916
Be my guest.

16:05.918 --> 16:07.607
Ladies first, I insist.

16:11.274 --> 16:12.547
Hey.

16:12.549 --> 16:14.287
You might want to see this.

16:17.035 --> 16:19.193
So, I ran a facial
recognition program

16:19.195 --> 16:22.341
and found all the footage
of Spears at O'Hare Airport.

16:22.343 --> 16:24.551
There's someone
with him.

16:24.553 --> 16:26.778
Mm-hmm.
Guy in a red scarf.

16:26.780 --> 16:29.122
Now, there's only five frames
before he's obscured,

16:29.124 --> 16:31.332
but Spears is definitely
talking to him.

16:31.334 --> 16:33.558
Nice catch, Nell.
Thanks.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.718
Now I just have to go through
all the footage again

16:35.720 --> 16:38.448
and try to find a clean frame of him
somewhere else in the airport.

16:38.450 --> 16:40.708
Good luck with that.

16:52.764 --> 16:55.190
Welcome to Bombay Beach,

16:55.192 --> 16:58.288
where man met nature
and nature won.

16:58.290 --> 17:00.264
Water here is
saltier than seawater.

17:00.266 --> 17:02.340
Reminds me of Chernobyl.

17:02.342 --> 17:03.730
You've been to Chernobyl?

17:03.732 --> 17:05.520
Briefly.

17:05.521 --> 17:07.296
All right.

17:07.298 --> 17:08.752
GPS...

17:08.755 --> 17:11.096
logged Ramirez's car...

17:11.098 --> 17:13.240
taking this dirt road,

17:13.242 --> 17:16.252
stopping about a quarter
mile further along.

17:16.255 --> 17:17.926
's not a through
road, though;

17:17.929 --> 17:19.803
must lead to a house.

17:19.805 --> 17:21.477
We'll walk.

17:26.801 --> 17:29.062
That's Ramirez's car.

17:29.064 --> 17:32.142
♪

17:33.315 --> 17:34.453
Got bodies.

17:54.177 --> 17:56.051
Federal agents!

17:56.053 --> 17:57.758
Federal agents

18:03.971 --> 18:06.315
Paris. Dave.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.077
In here.

18:30.626 --> 18:33.438
I'm guessing they're illegals.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.435
I'm guessing they're dead.

18:53.178 --> 18:54.702
Ramirez.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.645
Single gunshot
to the back of the head.

19:00.647 --> 19:03.893
Looks like Spears
beat us to it.

19:27.111 --> 19:29.420
You ever gonna do
anything with those?

19:30.877 --> 19:34.895
An exhibition, maybe.
One day.

19:34.897 --> 19:37.089
They made good time.

19:41.174 --> 19:42.530
Sorry. Traffic.

19:42.532 --> 19:44.522
Got caught
coming out of L.A.

19:46.866 --> 19:48.172
How many bodies?

19:48.174 --> 19:50.851
15, including Ramirez
and his two bodyguards.

19:50.853 --> 19:53.831
Looks like the house was
the staging point to move illegals on

19:53.833 --> 19:55.327
to other destinations,
probably Los Angeles.

19:55.353 --> 19:56.879
So...

19:56.880 --> 19:58.787
Ramirez arrives with his guys,

19:58.789 --> 20:00.395
he waits outside
by his car;

20:00.397 --> 20:02.537
his guys go inside
to take care of business,

20:02.539 --> 20:03.492
and for whatever reason,

20:03.494 --> 20:05.283
they kill all the people
in the house.

20:05.285 --> 20:08.632
Dozens of spent
nine-millimeter casings inside,

20:08.634 --> 20:10.072
none outside.

20:10.074 --> 20:13.420
While they're doing that,
Ramirez gets tapped from behind,

20:13.422 --> 20:16.350
low-velocity,
almost certain to be a .22-cal.

20:16.352 --> 20:17.505
No shell casings?

20:17.507 --> 20:18.844
No shell casings.

20:18.846 --> 20:20.068
Had his Beretta in his hand.

20:20.070 --> 20:21.959
Didn't even have time
to squeeze off a shot.

20:21.961 --> 20:23.801
So Ramirez
was already dead when

20:23.803 --> 20:25.893
his two guys came back out.
Yeah. Two guys

20:25.895 --> 20:28.322
got tapped in the back
of the head as well.

20:28.324 --> 20:31.168
Quick, silent and efficient.

20:31.170 --> 20:35.186
Shooter is a ghost,
ninja or... invisible man.

20:35.188 --> 20:38.032
Maybe all three.
Or none of the above.

20:38.034 --> 20:39.774
Sheriff thinks Ramirez
might have been tipped off

20:39.776 --> 20:41.414
that somebody was
coming to get him.

20:41.416 --> 20:43.507
Must have spooked him.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.633
Decided to get out.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.643
Was cutting his losses.

20:47.645 --> 20:48.782
So we weren't made.

20:48.784 --> 20:50.924
He thought we were
coming to kill him.

20:50.926 --> 20:52.750
Something's not adding up.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.340
Why would Spears kill
the guy who could get

20:54.366 --> 20:55.527
him out of here?

20:57.857 --> 20:59.715
Last sighting
I have of red-scarf dude

20:59.717 --> 21:01.639
was ten minutes
after he met with Spears.

21:01.641 --> 21:03.213
What if he's not
catching a flight?

21:03.215 --> 21:06.747
What if he's a local?
I'll check the parking lot footage.

21:06.749 --> 21:09.425
Red-scarf dude's
got to pop up somewhere.

21:09.427 --> 21:10.413
Thanks, amigo.

21:10.415 --> 21:11.920
Adios.

21:19.589 --> 21:22.970
♪

21:25.282 --> 21:27.457
What is he doing?

21:40.200 --> 21:41.606
You need a hand?

21:41.608 --> 21:44.334
It's color-coded, right?
Blue to blue, green to green.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.344
Open the stop valve,
turn on the pump.

21:46.346 --> 21:47.683
A rare thing.

21:47.685 --> 21:50.061
An agent who knows
his waste management.

21:50.063 --> 21:51.366
Former agent.

21:51.368 --> 21:52.823
Crap runs downhill.

21:52.825 --> 21:54.463
That's all you got
to remember.

22:01.865 --> 22:03.990
You find the guy
in the red scarf yet?

22:03.992 --> 22:06.184
Still looking.
How about the guy

22:06.186 --> 22:07.607
Spears talked to
on the satellite phone?

22:07.609 --> 22:08.779
Still listening.

22:08.781 --> 22:11.491
Nell's up to her ass
in NSA audio tape.

22:11.493 --> 22:12.964
You like working with Paris?

22:12.966 --> 22:14.705
Yeah.

22:14.707 --> 22:16.313
Think this will work out?

22:16.315 --> 22:18.355
Depends.

22:18.357 --> 22:20.198
On what?

22:20.200 --> 22:22.407
On how hard she hit you.

22:23.580 --> 22:26.141
She didn't knock
you down, right?

22:26.143 --> 22:29.272
Uh, no.

22:29.274 --> 22:30.377
You kind of stagger?

22:30.379 --> 22:32.922
Little.
Hmm.

22:32.924 --> 22:35.517
Then you should be okay then.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.475
I mean, she really hated you,

22:37.477 --> 22:39.167
she would have put you
on your ass.

22:39.169 --> 22:40.624
I've seen it.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.047
Yeah, me, too.

22:42.049 --> 22:44.441
You know why she did it?

22:44.443 --> 22:46.953
I probably deserved it.

22:46.955 --> 22:49.530
It's a long story.
Maybe I'll tell you one day.

22:49.532 --> 22:52.729
Come on...

22:53.618 --> 22:55.860
We gotta eat
more greens.

22:58.172 --> 23:00.799
So, what do you think happened
out at that ranch?

23:00.801 --> 23:02.423
Why would Spears

23:02.425 --> 23:05.437
shoot the one guy that was going
to get him across the border?

23:05.439 --> 23:06.709
Seems a dumb-ass thing to do.

23:06.712 --> 23:08.300
What makes you think
it was Spears?

23:08.302 --> 23:10.929
A low-velocity round
to the back of the head.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.234
Spears' signature.

23:12.236 --> 23:14.829
That's the shooter's signature.

23:14.831 --> 23:16.036
Maybe we got this wrong.

23:16.038 --> 23:19.133
Maybe Spears isn't the shooter.

23:32.076 --> 23:34.118
Wonder what it would be like--

23:34.120 --> 23:36.093
you, me, Red Team...

23:36.095 --> 23:38.136
Unbearable.

23:38.138 --> 23:39.726
...working together.

23:39.728 --> 23:41.619
We're supposed to be working
an unsolved murder case

23:41.621 --> 23:44.113
in which the victim was shot
in the back of the head

23:44.115 --> 23:46.424
with a low-velocity
round, Deeks.

23:46.426 --> 23:48.148
Living together.

23:48.150 --> 23:50.241
Me walking in on
you in the shower.

23:50.243 --> 23:52.166
Or the bunk room.

23:52.168 --> 23:54.326
You walking in on
me in the shower.

23:54.328 --> 23:55.883
Or the bunk room.

23:55.885 --> 23:58.394
You walking in
on Sam or Hetty.

24:00.121 --> 24:02.129
Who invited them?

24:02.131 --> 24:03.803
We're a team, aren't we?

24:03.805 --> 24:05.729
Yeah.
No, two people can be a team.

24:05.731 --> 24:09.278
Mm. How many case files
have you reviewed?

24:09.280 --> 24:11.069
Seven.
Mm?

24:11.071 --> 24:12.258
Almost.

24:12.260 --> 24:13.798
Thirty-three.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.054
Thirty-three?!

24:15.056 --> 24:16.779
Get on it!

24:17.902 --> 24:19.608
Detective Marty Deeks,
Cold Case Division.

24:20.966 --> 24:22.589
Oh. Yes.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.598
Hi... Hetty.
Yes. No, we're...

24:24.600 --> 24:26.406
Right now?

24:26.408 --> 24:28.030
- Ops on the double.
- Now.

24:28.032 --> 24:30.591
Okay. Yeah.
No, we're on it.

24:30.593 --> 24:33.053
Hey, uh, you think, uh,

24:33.055 --> 24:35.280
Hetty wears a shower cap?

24:41.391 --> 24:46.363
Red Scarf Guy, or "Dude,"
as Kai likes to call him,

24:46.365 --> 24:47.786
proved elusive.

24:47.788 --> 24:51.135
After meeting Spears, we only
caught a few frames of him

24:51.137 --> 24:54.265
in airport security cameras
until...

24:54.267 --> 24:58.167
he stopped for a
coffee in terminal two.

24:58.169 --> 24:59.724
Yeah, his name is Tommy Kraus.

24:59.726 --> 25:02.939
He lives in Los Angeles,
right there in your backyard.

25:02.941 --> 25:04.110
And here's the kicker.

25:05.335 --> 25:08.162
Tommy Kraus is the proud
owner of a satellite phone.

25:08.164 --> 25:12.180
The same satellite phone
used to contact Spears.

25:12.182 --> 25:16.249
Red Scarf Guy and Satellite
Guy are the same... guy.

25:16.251 --> 25:18.091
Tommy Kraus is

25:18.093 --> 25:20.217
like an underworld
Mr. Fix-it.

25:20.219 --> 25:23.197
You need weapons,
Kraus can arrange it.

25:23.199 --> 25:27.182
A safe house, false papers--
Kraus can supply it.

25:27.184 --> 25:30.765
So Kraus flies to Chicago,
meets Spears,

25:30.767 --> 25:33.946
talk a little business,
maybe get paid.

25:33.948 --> 25:36.140
He knows everyone, everything.

25:36.142 --> 25:38.149
Maybe he knows
where Spears has gone.

25:38.151 --> 25:42.168
Ms. Blye, Detective Deeks,
I want him.

25:42.170 --> 25:44.763
Dead or alive.

25:46.455 --> 25:49.568
Um.... a-alive.
Alive, alive.

25:49.570 --> 25:51.795
Alive is better than dead.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.730
Wow.

25:59.732 --> 26:01.756
We got a plan?

26:01.758 --> 26:03.548
We always got a plan.

26:03.550 --> 26:05.088
Yeah? What is it?
What is the plan?

26:05.090 --> 26:07.315
The plan is to go up
and knock on the door, and...

26:07.317 --> 26:08.370
You don't have
a plan, do you?

26:08.372 --> 26:09.793
I don't have a plan.

26:09.795 --> 26:12.639
Well, I guess we could just, uh,
wait for him to answer the door,

26:12.641 --> 26:14.648
and then take him in
for questioning.

26:14.650 --> 26:16.139
That's not a plan.

26:16.141 --> 26:18.315
Ah, sounds like
a damn good plan to me.

26:18.317 --> 26:20.124
What if he doesn't
answer the door?

26:23.440 --> 26:25.866
May I help you?

26:25.868 --> 26:27.374
Yeah. We're so
sorry we're late.

26:27.376 --> 26:28.461
We are.

26:28.463 --> 26:30.806
Marty forgot his meds... again.
I did.

26:30.808 --> 26:34.941
So we had to turn around and
go back and get 'em... again.

26:34.943 --> 26:36.531
Can Mr. Kraus
still see us?

26:36.533 --> 26:38.875
He didn't say anything
about an appointment.

26:38.877 --> 26:40.918
Well...

26:40.920 --> 26:43.028
that's maybe because
the appointment is...

26:43.030 --> 26:45.204
personal in nature,
and not something

26:45.206 --> 26:47.297
that he would share
with his... assistant?

26:47.299 --> 26:48.954
Uh... yeah.

26:48.956 --> 26:50.628
Look, he's not here right now,

26:50.630 --> 26:52.571
so you're going
to have to come back.

26:52.573 --> 26:55.250
Actually, that's not okay.
LAPD.

26:55.252 --> 26:56.656
That's your plan?

26:56.658 --> 27:00.222
Wait... you guys can't come
in here without a warrant.

27:00.224 --> 27:03.722
Probable cause... unless
that's incense I'm smelling.

27:03.724 --> 27:06.585
Wow. Yeah.
There's a kitty cat in the...

27:08.847 --> 27:10.654
Look, he's not here, okay?

27:10.656 --> 27:12.194
And you are?
Brett.

27:12.196 --> 27:13.534
His assistant?

27:15.744 --> 27:17.686
His bodyguard.

27:17.688 --> 27:18.858
All right.

27:18.860 --> 27:20.096
Oh, sure you are.

27:20.098 --> 27:21.268
You the pool boy, Brett?

27:21.270 --> 27:23.462
No, I bet you're
the gardener.

27:23.464 --> 27:26.057
Mm... gardener.

27:26.059 --> 27:28.016
You take care of
your, uh, boss's

27:28.018 --> 27:30.109
indoor potted plants,
do you?

27:30.111 --> 27:33.876
What do you want to know?

27:33.878 --> 27:35.299
Where's Tommy?

27:35.301 --> 27:38.481
You're going to be in
a whole lot more trouble with us

27:38.483 --> 27:41.126
than your boss if you don't tell
us what we need to know, kiddo.

27:44.592 --> 27:47.940
He got a call,
said he had to go meet some guy.

27:47.942 --> 27:49.413
How long?

27:49.415 --> 27:50.703
Couple of hours ago.

27:50.705 --> 27:52.628
He said he wouldn't be back
until tomorrow.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.219
Meet some
guy where?

27:54.221 --> 27:55.926
Some hotel...

27:55.928 --> 27:57.567
down in El Centro.

27:57.570 --> 28:00.715
Looks like
all roads lead to El Centro.

28:07.996 --> 28:10.120
Sam, looks like the phone used

28:10.122 --> 28:11.644
to make the call is a burner.

28:11.646 --> 28:12.966
Thanks, Eric.

28:12.968 --> 28:15.612
The call that Kraus received
was from a burn phone.

28:15.614 --> 28:19.212
Eric's trying to pull a
tape of the conversation.

28:19.214 --> 28:21.941
What if it's Spears
covering his tracks?

28:21.943 --> 28:24.017
He kills Ramirez first,

28:24.019 --> 28:25.875
then he calls Kraus,

28:25.877 --> 28:27.867
lures him here
to pop him, as well.

28:27.869 --> 28:30.480
Or maybe, Kraus heard
that Ramirez is dead,

28:30.482 --> 28:33.493
and is coming to meet Spears
with another plan.

28:33.495 --> 28:35.753
What?

28:35.755 --> 28:37.880
You think I'm too eager?

28:37.882 --> 28:40.559
Eager's good.
Keeps you sharp.

28:43.607 --> 28:46.335
You know, Hetty thinks

28:46.337 --> 28:47.808
they'd be good for each other.

28:47.810 --> 28:50.939
That's why she was checking in
on us the night you arrived.

28:50.941 --> 28:52.145
Did you notice that?

28:52.147 --> 28:54.171
I noticed.

28:54.173 --> 28:56.348
Did Callen?

28:57.437 --> 29:00.399
No. Did Paris?

29:00.401 --> 29:02.458
No.

29:02.460 --> 29:04.166
Maybe Hetty's right.

29:04.168 --> 29:05.925
Maybe they have got
something in common.

29:05.927 --> 29:08.989
Hetty's always right.

29:10.914 --> 29:13.090
So, you like
this whole road thing?

29:13.092 --> 29:15.049
Yeah, I love it.

29:15.051 --> 29:17.109
How about you?
Undercover work?

29:17.111 --> 29:19.955
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

29:19.957 --> 29:22.500
Yeah, me neither.

29:22.502 --> 29:24.811
You want a coffee?

29:24.813 --> 29:26.736
Oh, a beer would be good.

29:28.947 --> 29:31.207
Oh, what? What?
You don't drink beer?

29:32.430 --> 29:34.337
Soon as we get these guys.

29:34.339 --> 29:36.280
Full strength.

29:36.282 --> 29:38.037
None of the light stuff.

29:38.039 --> 29:40.214
Mm-hmm. Got it.

29:48.084 --> 29:49.708
- Sam...
- Yep.

29:49.710 --> 29:51.465
Black BMW
outside the hotel.

29:51.467 --> 29:52.754
That's Kraus.

29:52.756 --> 29:54.696
Got him.

30:19.678 --> 30:21.083
Oh, no...

30:21.085 --> 30:22.523
Hello, Tommy.

30:22.525 --> 30:23.695
Do I know you?

30:23.697 --> 30:25.035
Not yet.

30:25.037 --> 30:26.206
One down.

30:26.208 --> 30:29.472
One to go.

30:29.474 --> 30:32.452
13 cases in five years
that fit the M.O.--

30:32.454 --> 30:35.550
low-velocity, up-close wound
to the back of the head.

30:35.552 --> 30:36.973
Different victims,
different states.

30:36.975 --> 30:39.132
Only connection is
the person who shot them.

30:39.134 --> 30:40.522
Contract killings.

30:40.524 --> 30:43.870
Why would a Jihadist be
working as a contract killer?

30:46.049 --> 30:48.224
He wouldn't.

30:55.976 --> 30:58.939
Kitchen is closed,
laboratory is open.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.078
I'm hungry.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.255
Rules is rules.

31:15.148 --> 31:17.490
Yeah, you're doing
a bullet comparison?

31:17.492 --> 31:19.918
Mm. Three slugs,
three victims--

31:19.920 --> 31:23.434
Ramirez and his
two bodyguards.

31:27.453 --> 31:31.035
And I just found something
that shouldn't be there.

31:31.037 --> 31:33.346
On which bullet?

31:33.348 --> 31:35.188
All three of 'em.

31:35.190 --> 31:37.749
So, I was going through
the footage we found

31:37.751 --> 31:40.211
from the airport on Tommy Kraus.

31:40.213 --> 31:41.466
That's when I found it.

31:41.468 --> 31:43.425
Easily missed.
Mm-hmm.

31:43.427 --> 31:45.702
We're gonna have to find
another camera angle.

31:47.411 --> 31:48.917
He's definitely
talking to someone.

31:48.919 --> 31:50.290
Let's see who it is.

31:50.292 --> 31:53.320
You've got company.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.884
Black coffee, one sugar.

31:59.886 --> 32:02.009
Turkey sandwich, no mayo.

32:02.011 --> 32:04.186
What do you want, Roy?

32:04.188 --> 32:06.664
An elephant stamp
for remembering?

32:06.666 --> 32:10.013
Hey, give me one for caring.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.558
Why didn't you say, "Go to hell"
when Hetty offered you this?

32:12.560 --> 32:14.667
Well, 'cause it's just
for a couple months

32:14.669 --> 32:16.090
till Danny gets back on deck.

32:16.092 --> 32:18.719
Question was why, not how long.

32:18.721 --> 32:20.645
I don't know why.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.938
Look, if you're looking for answers,
I don't have any more answers.

32:22.940 --> 32:24.412
I gave you...
No, no, no. I'm...

32:24.414 --> 32:26.003
I'm not looking
for any answers.

32:26.005 --> 32:28.648
Trying to find answers
kept me up for three years.

32:28.650 --> 32:30.640
All right, you had
your reasons.

32:30.642 --> 32:33.988
If I wanted to know, you would
have let me know, right?

32:42.629 --> 32:44.504
Just till Danny's back then.

32:44.506 --> 32:46.378
Right.
Right.

32:46.380 --> 32:49.241
All right, let's start
with: I'm the boss.

32:50.164 --> 32:51.920
Fine, you're the boss.

32:51.922 --> 32:53.578
You do as I say.

32:53.580 --> 32:54.549
Yeah.

32:54.551 --> 32:56.609
You keep your
opinions to yourself.

32:56.611 --> 32:57.696
Understood, Cap'n.

32:57.698 --> 32:59.873
And no indoor soccer.

33:02.051 --> 33:04.729
No, none.

33:08.362 --> 33:10.957
I'm sorry you got shot, Roy.

33:12.666 --> 33:15.227
Me, too.

33:24.738 --> 33:27.197
Accounts
in the Cayman Islands,

33:27.199 --> 33:30.295
properties in South America,
Spain, and Belgium.

33:30.297 --> 33:32.471
I like the place
in Madrid.

33:32.473 --> 33:34.782
You're a wealthy guy,
Tommy.

33:34.784 --> 33:37.109
You know how good
that makes me feel?

33:37.111 --> 33:38.633
That you're
a wealthy guy?

33:38.635 --> 33:40.927
That you're telling me all this.

33:40.929 --> 33:44.912
Because there is no way you got
all this information legally,

33:44.914 --> 33:48.762
and you are dealing, here,
with someone who knows the law.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.776
Intimately.

33:53.535 --> 33:56.414
Are you intimate
with the Patriot Act, Tommy?

33:58.676 --> 34:00.734
Legislation enacted
to protect

34:00.736 --> 34:02.358
Americans from terrorists.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.585
Tommy the Terrorist.

34:04.587 --> 34:05.622
I like that.

34:05.624 --> 34:07.263
That's funny.
Has a nice ring to it.

34:07.265 --> 34:08.435
Mm-hmm.

34:08.437 --> 34:11.181
It's not funny
for you, though.

34:11.183 --> 34:13.157
You think I'm
a terrorist?

34:13.159 --> 34:15.284
We have you on tape
arranging to help

34:15.286 --> 34:17.995
a known terrorist
illegally cross the border,

34:17.996 --> 34:20.489
we have photos of you meeting
that same terrorist,

34:20.492 --> 34:23.170
and we have evidence
that you helped supply weapons

34:23.172 --> 34:26.300
for a planned terrorist attack
on the United States.

34:26.302 --> 34:28.561
It's called giving aid and
comfort to the enemy, Tommy.

34:28.563 --> 34:30.185
It's also known
as treason.

34:30.187 --> 34:32.076
I am not a terrorist,
I am a patriot.

34:32.078 --> 34:33.364
I tried to stop
this thing

34:33.367 --> 34:36.094
as soon as I found out
what he was planning.

34:36.097 --> 34:38.221
What who was planning?

34:38.223 --> 34:41.620
Look, I thought
he was a dealer.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.594
I get him across
the border,

34:43.597 --> 34:46.525
I supply him with some
hardware, a safe house.

34:46.527 --> 34:48.150
I mean, it's no big deal.

34:48.152 --> 34:51.614
I swear, as soon as I
realized what he was up to,

34:51.617 --> 34:53.105
I tried to stop him.

34:53.107 --> 34:54.177
How?

34:54.179 --> 34:55.818
Look, he's the enemy, right?

34:55.820 --> 34:58.313
So it's not murder,
it's lawful.

34:58.315 --> 34:59.535
I was protecting
my country.

34:59.537 --> 35:01.293
I deserve a medal
for what I did.

35:01.295 --> 35:02.682
How, Tommy?

35:02.684 --> 35:07.019
I hired a contractor
to clean up the mess--

35:07.021 --> 35:10.954
Santoso,
Ramirez, Spears.

35:12.813 --> 35:15.892
Spears isn't the shooter.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.923
He's the target.

35:39.446 --> 35:40.717
Callen, he's here.

35:40.719 --> 35:41.889
Got him.

35:43.882 --> 35:46.979
Roy, stay in the car.

35:49.022 --> 35:50.579
There he is.

35:51.048 --> 35:52.337
Spears!

35:54.514 --> 35:55.769
I'll take the stairs.

35:55.771 --> 35:57.108
Watch the elevator.

36:18.541 --> 36:19.995
Come on, come on, come on.

36:23.481 --> 36:24.516
Yeah.

36:24.518 --> 36:25.957
Paris, can you hear me?

36:25.959 --> 36:27.212
I...

36:27.214 --> 36:29.054
Dave?

36:29.056 --> 36:31.314
...lipstick...
Did you say "lipstick"?

36:31.316 --> 36:32.904
Tell us his name.

36:34.613 --> 36:36.755
The shooter's not a man.

36:38.129 --> 36:39.217
It's a woman.

36:39.219 --> 36:41.091
We've seen her before.

37:10.493 --> 37:14.628
♪

39:25.893 --> 39:27.951
I told you to stay in the car.

39:27.953 --> 39:29.576
I know, I know.
My bad.

39:29.578 --> 39:31.300
It won't
happen again, I promise.

39:36.073 --> 39:38.199
What's that?

39:40.209 --> 39:42.418
Kiss of death.

40:12.907 --> 40:14.915
Hey.
Hey.

40:14.917 --> 40:16.205
Want to stay
for dinner?

40:16.207 --> 40:17.545
Dave's not cooking.

40:18.935 --> 40:22.618
I appreciate that,
but Sam has a family.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.828
Right.

40:27.390 --> 40:31.860
What exactly happened
the night Roy got shot?

40:39.513 --> 40:41.034
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

40:50.780 --> 40:52.788
I shot a guy,
and he didn't stay down.

40:52.790 --> 40:53.926
He was wearing a vest.

40:53.928 --> 40:55.752
Roy saved my life.

40:57.309 --> 40:59.485
So what's the problem?

41:02.382 --> 41:04.976
It's complicated.

41:18.355 --> 41:20.548
We got a case.

41:21.469 --> 41:23.477
Where?

41:23.479 --> 41:25.604
Bald Knob, Arkansas.

41:25.606 --> 41:27.730
Hear it's quite a place.

41:33.273 --> 41:35.901
I'm good with
complicated.

41:36.823 --> 41:39.635
It's really complicated.

41:42.599 --> 41:45.780
So, um...

41:48.509 --> 41:50.936
I guess that beer's
going to have to wait.

41:50.938 --> 41:53.113
I guess so.

42:03.159 --> 42:04.732
Hey.

42:05.788 --> 42:07.545
Take care, Roy.

42:23.954 --> 42:28.356
We got it wrong
from the start, Owen.

42:28.358 --> 42:31.822
Tyler wasn't killed
because he filmed Spears.

42:31.824 --> 42:36.226
