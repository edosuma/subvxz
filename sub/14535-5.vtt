Narrator:
<i> Previously on</i>
<i> "The American West"...</i>

00:11.000 --> 00:13.125
<i> In the decade</i>
<i> since the Civil War,</i>

00:13.166 --> 00:17.333
<i> America has been desperate</i>
<i> to settle the West.</i>

00:17.333 --> 00:19.667
<i> But the effort</i>
<i> has been met with conflict</i>

00:19.667 --> 00:22.166
-<i> at nearly every turn. </i>
- Who's the cashier?

00:22.166 --> 00:24.125
Narrator:
<i> Outlaws like Jesse James</i>

00:24.125 --> 00:25.667
<i> have terrorized</i>
<i> railroads and banks</i>

00:25.709 --> 00:28.208
<i> across the Midwest...</i>

00:29.375 --> 00:31.375
<i> leading to one of</i>
<i> the largest manhunts</i>

00:31.375 --> 00:34.208
<i> in American history.</i>

00:34.250 --> 00:36.458
<i> But Jesse James gets away</i>

00:36.458 --> 00:38.542
<i> and goes into hiding</i>
<i> for two years.</i>

00:40.667 --> 00:43.667
<i> In the Great Plains,</i>
<i> the United States military</i>

00:43.667 --> 00:47.542
<i> looks to defeat the armies</i>
<i>of Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse</i>

00:47.542 --> 00:49.208
<i> and secure the gold</i>

00:49.208 --> 00:52.625
<i> in the Black Hills</i>
<i> of South Dakota.</i>

00:52.625 --> 00:55.542
<i> But after they're defeated at</i>
<i> the Battle of Little Bighorn,</i>

00:55.542 --> 00:59.750
<i> the U.S. government</i>
<i> sees the extermination</i>
<i> of the buffalo</i>

00:59.750 --> 01:03.166
<i> as a way of starving</i>
<i> the Lakota nation</i>

01:03.166 --> 01:04.500
<i> into submission.</i>

01:06.250 --> 01:09.542
<i> ( theme song playing )</i>

01:54.750 --> 01:57.333
Narrator:
<i> After their victory</i>
<i> at Little Bighorn...</i>

01:57.333 --> 01:59.458
( bowstring snaps )

01:59.458 --> 02:02.291
<i> ...Lakota warriors</i>
<i> led by Crazy Horse</i>

02:02.291 --> 02:04.291
<i> continue to fight</i>
<i> for their land.</i>

02:04.291 --> 02:06.208
Hold the line!

02:06.208 --> 02:08.750
( speaking
Lakota language )

02:10.667 --> 02:12.333
Narrator:
<i> But despite winning</i>
<i> small battles</i>

02:12.333 --> 02:14.333
<i> against the U.S. Army,</i>

02:14.333 --> 02:16.667
<i> the struggles</i>
<i> for the Indians</i>

02:16.667 --> 02:18.500
<i> are only getting worse.</i>

02:20.417 --> 02:23.166
<i> General William</i>
<i> Tecumseh Sherman's strategy</i>

02:23.166 --> 02:26.875
<i> of exterminating the buffalo</i>
<i> is working...</i>

02:29.166 --> 02:32.500
<i> as more and more Indians</i>
<i> face starvation.</i>

02:39.458 --> 02:42.291
<i> Lakota leaders</i>
<i> Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse</i>

02:42.291 --> 02:43.792
<i> are running out of options.</i>

02:43.792 --> 02:46.458
( speaking
Lakota language )

03:12.750 --> 03:17.625
Narrator:
<i> After years of leading</i>
<i> the Lakota people together,</i>

03:17.625 --> 03:22.208
<i> Sitting Bull</i>
<i> and Crazy Horse part ways.</i>

03:30.959 --> 03:35.333
<i> Sitting Bull leads</i>
<i> 5,000 Indians north</i>
<i> to Canada...</i>

03:37.333 --> 03:39.375
<i> while Crazy Horse</i>
<i> stays behind</i>

03:39.375 --> 03:42.375
<i> with fewer</i>
<i> than 1,000 warriors,</i>

03:42.375 --> 03:45.208
<i> determined to remain</i>
<i> on their rightful land.</i>

03:48.375 --> 03:51.750
The Native Americans pressed on
despite the violence

03:51.750 --> 03:55.291
and the decimation of
their tribes and their culture.

03:55.291 --> 03:59.500
<i>They were persistent in wanting</i>
<i> to maintain their beliefs,</i>

03:59.500 --> 04:01.834
<i> and they pressed on</i>
<i> because they had courage.</i>

04:09.667 --> 04:13.542
Narrator:
<i> With the Indian population</i>
<i> depleted,</i>

04:13.542 --> 04:16.542
<i> the U.S. government</i>
<i> moves full force</i>

04:16.542 --> 04:18.792
<i> into the Black Hills,</i>

04:18.792 --> 04:21.208
<i> allowing them</i>
<i> to take the land</i>

04:21.208 --> 04:23.917
<i> and the gold discovered there</i>
<i> three years earlier.</i>

04:28.001 --> 04:30.750
<i> By 1880,</i>
<i> the area is yielding</i>

04:30.750 --> 04:34.750
<i> over $7 million in gold</i>
<i> and silver annually,</i>

04:34.792 --> 04:39.291
<i> over $170 million</i>
<i> in today's dollars.</i>

04:41.458 --> 04:45.250
David Eisenbach:
<i> This is just this moment</i>
<i> of extreme opportunity</i>

04:45.250 --> 04:49.500
<i> to just go out there</i>
<i> and strike it rich.</i>

04:49.500 --> 04:52.834
And a lot of men and women
were able to do that.

04:54.667 --> 04:56.709
<i> And people who are not seeing</i>
<i> the opportunities</i>

04:56.709 --> 04:58.458
<i> that they saw</i>
<i> in prior generations</i>

04:58.458 --> 05:01.583
see the West
as that great promised land.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.417
Narrator:
<i> As gold pours into</i>
<i> the economy,</i>

05:10.417 --> 05:12.375
<i> the U.S.</i>
<i> is the first country</i>

05:12.375 --> 05:15.291
<i> to pull itself out</i>
<i> of the global depression.</i>

05:20.834 --> 05:22.875
<i> And over the next decade,</i>

05:22.875 --> 05:28.458
<i>more than 12 million immigrants</i>
<i> arrive in the United States,</i>

05:28.458 --> 05:32.542
<i> looking to take full advantage</i>
<i> of the country's prosperity.</i>

05:34.625 --> 05:38.834
<i> But the population boom</i>
<i> brings a problem--</i>

05:38.834 --> 05:41.001
<i> millions of new mouths</i>
<i> to feed.</i>

05:44.834 --> 05:48.041
<i> The solution is found</i>
<i> in the West.</i>

05:50.000 --> 05:53.625
<i> The wide-open spaces</i>
<i> provide the perfect spot</i>

05:53.625 --> 05:55.834
<i> for a new American</i>
<i> industry...</i>

05:59.291 --> 06:00.500
<i> ...cattle.</i>

06:11.001 --> 06:13.000
H.W. Brands:
<i> There were lots of cattle</i>
<i> in Texas</i>

06:13.041 --> 06:15.875
on the border of Mexico
for a long time.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.709
<i> But it wasn't until</i>
<i> the railroads</i>

06:18.709 --> 06:21.375
<i> that they could be moved</i>
<i> out to the plains</i>

06:21.375 --> 06:25.500
<i> and shipped from there</i>
<i> to hungry people in the East.</i>

06:27.583 --> 06:29.667
( mooing )

06:29.667 --> 06:32.959
Narrator:
<i> Cattle that would sell</i>
<i>for ten dollars a head in Texas</i>

06:32.959 --> 06:36.542
<i> are worth forty dollars a head</i>
<i> on the East Coast.</i>

06:38.959 --> 06:44.417
<i> This booming industry breeds</i>
<i> a new sort of businessman--</i>

06:44.417 --> 06:47.125
<i> the cattle baron.</i>

06:47.125 --> 06:50.583
<i> Cattle barons buy up</i>
<i> huge tracts of grazing land</i>

06:50.583 --> 06:53.583
<i> stretching from Kansas</i>
<i> to California.</i>

06:53.583 --> 06:56.875
Kiefer Sutherland:
<i> Those land grabs presented</i>
<i> unbelievable opportunities.</i>

06:56.875 --> 06:59.458
<i> We're talking about</i>
<i> sometimes millions of acres,</i>

06:59.458 --> 07:02.083
of these farms, and thousands
and thousands of head of cattle.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.542
Narrator:
<i> But with so much product</i>

07:08.542 --> 07:11.917
<i> spread across</i>
<i> such a vast, unguarded area,</i>

07:11.917 --> 07:14.000
<i> herds belonging</i>
<i> to cattle barons</i>

07:14.000 --> 07:17.458
<i> are becoming</i>
<i> a major target...</i>

07:17.458 --> 07:18.792
<i> for outlaws.</i>

07:20.500 --> 07:22.917
<i> And in the territory</i>
<i> of New Mexico,</i>

07:22.917 --> 07:24.792
<i> one cattle rustler</i>
<i> will become</i>

07:24.792 --> 07:27.792
<i> one of the most notorious men</i>
<i> in the West.</i>

07:29.709 --> 07:33.500
<i> He's born Henry McCarty...</i>

07:33.500 --> 07:36.583
<i> but the world</i>
<i> will come to know him</i>

07:36.583 --> 07:39.166
<i> as Billy the Kid.</i>

07:43.166 --> 07:47.041
<i> His story begins</i>
<i> 2,000 miles to the east.</i>

07:49.542 --> 07:53.583
Paul Hutton:
<i> Billy the Kid came from</i>
<i> Hell's Kitchen in New York,</i>

07:53.583 --> 07:56.417
<i> and there's a beautiful</i>
<i> sort of irony</i>

07:56.458 --> 07:58.834
<i> to the idea of a kid</i>
<i> from the slums of New York</i>

07:58.834 --> 08:01.834
becoming this icon
of the Wild West.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.083
Narrator:
<i> Billy never knew his father.</i>

08:07.083 --> 08:08.959
<i> In the early 1870s,</i>

08:09.001 --> 08:11.500
<i> he and his mother</i>
<i> move to New Mexico.</i>

08:13.000 --> 08:15.750
<i> But within a year</i>
<i> of arriving, she dies...</i>

08:18.875 --> 08:23.083
<i> and Billy is all alone</i>
<i> in an unknown land.</i>

08:32.834 --> 08:34.750
( patrons chattering )

08:34.750 --> 08:37.458
Narrator:
<i> For years he wanders</i>
<i> without direction.</i>

08:41.750 --> 08:43.000
What'll you have?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.125
Whiskey.

08:51.625 --> 08:52.834
Leave the bottle.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.917
Burt Reynolds:
<i> There were all kinds</i>
<i> of cowboys.</i>

09:05.834 --> 09:07.875
<i> There were ones</i>
<i> that were loud</i>

09:07.875 --> 09:11.083
<i> and drunk and a pain,</i>

09:11.083 --> 09:15.583
<i> and then there's the quiet</i>
<i> ones who didn't say anything.</i>

09:15.583 --> 09:17.583
Always sat in the corner.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.667
Those are the ones
you had to watch out for.

09:30.166 --> 09:34.500
Narrator:
<i> To get by, Billy turns to</i>
<i> the one thing he can do best.</i>

09:36.792 --> 09:39.750
Hutton:
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> was superb with a gun.</i>

09:39.750 --> 09:42.709
He used every
spare dollar he had

09:42.709 --> 09:44.542
to buy ammunition
for practice.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.834
<i> He understood</i>
<i> very early on</i>

09:59.834 --> 10:03.041
that the gun
was his ticket to success.

10:06.125 --> 10:09.291
<i> And he's not shy</i>
<i> about using it.</i>

10:14.001 --> 10:15.875
Narrator:
<i> Armed with his trusted weapon,</i>

10:15.875 --> 10:18.750
<i> Billy starts stealing cattle</i>
<i> from wealthy ranchers</i>

10:18.750 --> 10:22.001
<i> and selling them</i>
<i> one county over.</i>

10:22.001 --> 10:26.001
John McCain:
<i> Self-reliance is one of</i>
<i> the more salient features</i>

10:26.001 --> 10:29.959
<i> of the Old West</i>
<i> because it was tough.</i>

10:29.959 --> 10:32.291
And in those kinds
of environment,

10:32.291 --> 10:34.291
the tough are the ones
that survive.

10:39.125 --> 10:41.625
<i> ( fire crackling )</i>

10:48.959 --> 10:51.709
<i> ( hoofbeats approaching )</i>

10:55.001 --> 10:56.333
( whickers )

10:57.834 --> 11:00.291
Cowboy:
<i> Where are ya headed?</i>

11:00.291 --> 11:03.709
Into Lincoln.

11:03.709 --> 11:06.166
I'm just rounding up
some strays.

11:08.083 --> 11:11.208
Those cattle you have
belong to John Tunstall.

11:13.959 --> 11:17.417
Well, then John Tunstall
can come and take them
back himself.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.959
( gun clicks )

11:29.291 --> 11:32.333
Be in your best interest
to let me get on my way.

11:36.792 --> 11:39.750
That's not how
this works.

11:39.750 --> 11:42.208
Doesn't look like you
have much of a choice.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.792
( gun clicks )

12:13.417 --> 12:16.875
Narrator:
<i> Young cattle thief</i>
<i> Billy the Kid</i>

12:16.875 --> 12:19.375
<i> has just been captured</i>
<i> by a local rancher</i>

12:19.375 --> 12:22.375
<i> he tried to steal from.</i>

12:38.333 --> 12:42.792
Most men shoot
cattle rustlers
on the spot.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.333
( gun clicks )

12:50.291 --> 12:53.000
You still haven't told me
who you're workin' for.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.250
I don't work for anyone.

13:01.250 --> 13:02.875
( gun clicks )

13:02.875 --> 13:05.458
Son, in Lincoln County,

13:05.458 --> 13:09.001
everybody works
for somebody.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.250
Yeah...
well... not me.

13:17.166 --> 13:20.250
You strike me as a man
used to gettin' what he wants.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.208
You got that right.

13:25.208 --> 13:27.333
Only thing about that is...

13:28.959 --> 13:30.125
( gun clicks )

13:30.125 --> 13:31.792
so am I.

13:38.417 --> 13:41.083
Easy. Easy.

13:42.166 --> 13:44.166
You got a lot of men.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.125
You got room for one more?

13:55.917 --> 13:59.375
When Billy the Kid
came to Lincoln,
he needed a job.

14:02.458 --> 14:06.125
<i> John Tunstall</i>
<i> happened to need cowboys.</i>

14:06.125 --> 14:08.458
<i> Cowboys who could use guns,</i>

14:08.458 --> 14:12.458
and so Billy became
one of his employees.

14:13.917 --> 14:15.583
Narrator:
<i> After roaming the West</i>
<i> for years,</i>

14:15.583 --> 14:22.001
<i>Billy the Kid has finally found</i>
<i> a place to belong--</i>

14:22.001 --> 14:24.500
<i> working for an ambitious</i>
<i> rancher and businessman</i>

14:24.500 --> 14:26.834
<i> in New Mexico...</i>

14:26.834 --> 14:29.417
<i> named John Tunstall.</i>

14:29.417 --> 14:32.001
Mark Lee Gardner:
<i> John Henry Tunstall</i>
<i> has come to the West</i>

14:32.001 --> 14:33.583
<i> to make a fortune.</i>

14:33.583 --> 14:35.875
<i> And he settles</i>
<i> on Lincoln County,</i>

14:35.875 --> 14:38.208
where he can make
a lot of money.

14:39.959 --> 14:43.208
Narrator:
<i> Looking to make it big</i>
<i>in the booming cattle industry,</i>

14:43.208 --> 14:47.083
<i> Tunstall has bought a ranch</i>
<i>outside of Lincoln, New Mexico,</i>

14:47.083 --> 14:50.458
<i> and in just two short years</i>
<i> has become</i>

14:50.500 --> 14:53.458
<i> one of the most successful</i>
<i>cattle barons in the territory.</i>

14:55.001 --> 14:56.375
<i> But with his success,</i>

14:56.375 --> 14:59.959
<i> he's upset</i>
<i> some very powerful men.</i>

15:06.625 --> 15:10.500
Chamberlain:
<i> Lincoln was the wildest</i>
<i> of the Wild West.</i>

15:10.500 --> 15:13.208
The law was almost
nonexistent,

15:13.208 --> 15:16.125
<i> and the people</i>
<i> who controlled it</i>

15:16.125 --> 15:19.250
<i> were generally corrupt.</i>

15:21.625 --> 15:23.625
Narrator:
<i> The established power</i>
<i> in Lincoln County</i>

15:23.625 --> 15:27.125
<i> was a group</i>
<i> of wealthy land owners</i>
<i> and cattle barons</i>

15:27.125 --> 15:29.125
<i> known simply</i>
<i> as "the House."</i>

15:31.000 --> 15:32.458
<i> "The House"</i>
<i> controls everything</i>

15:32.458 --> 15:34.500
<i> from cattle prices,</i>
<i> land holdings</i>

15:34.500 --> 15:36.875
<i> and government positions.</i>

15:36.875 --> 15:40.417
<i> Even the law</i>
<i> is on their payroll.</i>

15:40.417 --> 15:43.208
Gardner:
<i> The House controlled</i>
<i> Lincoln County,</i>

15:43.208 --> 15:45.375
<i> and they were prominent.</i>

15:45.375 --> 15:47.458
<i> In fact, a lot of people</i>
<i> that lived in Lincoln</i>

15:47.458 --> 15:50.291
<i> really looked at them</i>
<i> as oppressors.</i>

15:50.291 --> 15:52.500
<i> And John Henry Tunstall</i>
<i> arrives</i>

15:52.500 --> 15:55.625
<i> to kind of horn in</i>
<i> on the monopoly</i>

15:55.625 --> 15:58.250
that the House has had
for a long time.

16:00.500 --> 16:04.500
Narrator:
<i> Tensions quickly rise</i>
<i>between Tunstall and the House,</i>

16:04.500 --> 16:07.625
<i> but the rancher</i>
<i> is not one to back down.</i>

16:11.500 --> 16:14.000
<i> Looking to build up</i>
<i> his small army,</i>

16:14.000 --> 16:16.667
<i> Tunstall sees potential</i>
<i> in young Billy.</i>

16:16.667 --> 16:18.291
Gardner:
<i> In Lincoln County,</i>

16:18.291 --> 16:20.375
<i> everyone was forced</i>
<i> to make a choice--</i>

16:20.375 --> 16:22.500
<i> either you supported</i>
<i> the House</i>

16:22.500 --> 16:24.542
<i> or you supported</i>
<i> John Henry Tunstall.</i>

16:24.542 --> 16:26.291
<i> There was no in between.</i>

16:26.291 --> 16:29.208
So, once Billy accepted that job
with John Henry Tunstall,

16:29.208 --> 16:32.542
he was gonna be
Tunstall's man.

16:32.542 --> 16:35.375
Narrator:
<i> Over the next few months,</i>
<i> the young outlaw</i>

16:35.375 --> 16:39.208
<i> becomes Tunstall's</i>
<i> most trusted gunslinger.</i>

16:39.208 --> 16:41.000
<i> And for the first time,</i>

16:41.000 --> 16:43.375
<i> it feels like</i>
<i> this orphan of the West</i>

16:43.375 --> 16:45.291
<i> has a home.</i>

16:45.291 --> 16:47.959
Tunstall was a mentor
to Billy the Kid.

16:47.959 --> 16:49.458
<i> Billy really liked Tunstall</i>

16:49.458 --> 16:52.583
<i> because he treated him fairly,</i>
<i> he paid him well,</i>

16:52.583 --> 16:56.166
<i> and he was probably</i>
<i> the first man in his life</i>

16:56.166 --> 16:59.333
Billy looked up to
and respected and treated him

16:59.375 --> 17:01.001
like Billy
wanted to be treated.

17:03.208 --> 17:05.001
Put your plate
over here, Billy.

17:05.001 --> 17:07.333
Thanks.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.959
I'm starved.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.458
It doesn't
get any better
than this, son.

17:12.458 --> 17:14.667
Good to have you
on board.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.542
Thank you.

17:18.583 --> 17:21.667
Gardner:
<i> If you think about it,</i>
<i> Billy had been scraping by.</i>

17:21.667 --> 17:25.625
<i> He was looked at</i>
<i> by most people as riffraff.</i>

17:25.625 --> 17:27.667
But John Henry Tunstall--
it's kind of shocking,

17:27.667 --> 17:30.709
but he offers this hoodlum--
he offers him a job.

17:33.041 --> 17:35.291
<i> For a young man</i>
<i> of Billy's age,</i>

17:35.291 --> 17:38.291
<i> that was incredible,</i>
<i> that was life-changing.</i>

17:38.291 --> 17:41.041
So he becomes a loyal,

17:41.041 --> 17:43.500
devoted employee
and friend

17:43.500 --> 17:45.583
<i> of John Henry Tunstall.</i>

17:47.041 --> 17:48.583
Narrator:
<i> While Billy the Kid</i>

17:48.583 --> 17:50.709
<i> is now a part of</i>
<i> the burgeoning cattle industry</i>

17:50.709 --> 17:52.709
<i> that's fueling</i>
<i> America's growth...</i>

17:56.041 --> 17:58.291
<i> several hundred miles</i>
<i> to the north,</i>

17:58.291 --> 18:01.001
<i> one man is doing</i>
<i> everything he can</i>

18:01.001 --> 18:03.500
<i> to hold off</i>
<i> western expansion.</i>

18:03.500 --> 18:06.250
<i> ( warriors whooping )</i>

18:25.417 --> 18:27.750
Narrator:
<i> Since parting ways</i>
<i> with Sitting Bull,</i>

18:27.750 --> 18:29.792
<i> Lakota warrior</i>
<i> Crazy Horse</i>

18:29.792 --> 18:31.583
<i> has tried to</i>
<i> protect his people</i>

18:31.583 --> 18:35.291
<i> from the flood</i>
<i> of settlers.</i>

18:35.291 --> 18:37.041
<i> But after months</i>
<i> of watching</i>

18:37.041 --> 18:41.166
<i> the buffalo extermination</i>
<i> starve his people,</i>

18:41.166 --> 18:44.041
<i> Crazy Horse</i>
<i> is running out of options...</i>

18:47.375 --> 18:48.792
<i> and is forced</i>
<i> to do something</i>

18:48.792 --> 18:51.166
<i> he swore</i>
<i> he would never do.</i>

19:41.625 --> 19:43.125
Easy, boys.

20:00.417 --> 20:03.458
( speaking
Lakota language )

20:10.834 --> 20:14.333
Narrator:
<i> On May 6, 1877,</i>

20:14.375 --> 20:17.291
<i> Crazy Horse, the man that led</i>
<i> his people to victory</i>

20:17.291 --> 20:22.166
<i> at the Battle</i>
<i> of Little Bighorn,</i>
<i> surrenders,</i>

20:22.166 --> 20:26.458
<i> marking the end</i>
<i> of 17 years of resistance.</i>

20:26.458 --> 20:28.208
Larry Pourier:
<i> When Crazy Horse surrenders,</i>

20:28.208 --> 20:30.375
<i> I really believe</i>
<i>everyone knew that was the end.</i>

20:30.375 --> 20:32.583
But the reality is
if he didn't do that,

20:32.583 --> 20:34.250
most of us wouldn't be here.

20:37.709 --> 20:39.333
<i> We would've died fighting</i>

20:39.333 --> 20:41.333
<i> instead of going</i>
<i> to the reservation.</i>

20:54.500 --> 20:56.709
Narrator:
<i> But while the move</i>
<i> onto a reservation</i>

20:56.709 --> 20:58.583
<i> may have saved his people</i>
<i> from starving...</i>

21:02.375 --> 21:04.458
<i> Crazy Horse</i>
<i> is beginning to realize</i>

21:04.458 --> 21:06.875
<i> that it's doing something</i>
<i> far worse.</i>

21:13.458 --> 21:17.208
Pourier:
<i> When they put us</i>
<i> on the reservations,</i>

21:17.208 --> 21:21.166
<i>it really kinda took the spirit</i>
<i> out of a lot of people.</i>

21:21.166 --> 21:23.500
They took away our pride,
they took away our life,

21:23.500 --> 21:25.875
they took away our manhood

21:25.875 --> 21:28.792
<i> because we</i>
<i> couldn't hunt anymore.</i>

21:28.792 --> 21:33.041
<i> A lot of people died,</i>
<i> not from sicknesses and stuff,</i>

21:33.041 --> 21:35.291
<i> they died</i>
<i> from broken spirits.</i>

21:37.333 --> 21:39.834
He trusts in me.
He speaks through me.

21:39.834 --> 21:42.709
<i> The Lord, the Savior.</i>

21:42.750 --> 21:45.709
Narrator:
<i> But the government</i>
<i> isn't content</i>

21:45.709 --> 21:48.375
<i> just to tell the Indians</i>
<i> where to live...</i>

21:51.792 --> 21:55.000
<i> they're also determined</i>
<i> to change their culture.</i>

22:00.792 --> 22:03.625
Andrew Isenberg:
<i> Large numbers of Christian</i>
<i> missionaries</i>

22:03.625 --> 22:06.750
<i> were in fact sent out</i>
<i> to reservations in the West</i>

22:06.750 --> 22:09.542
to do the work of, as people
in the 19th century saw it,

22:09.542 --> 22:13.333
"civilizing"
these Native Americans.

22:16.834 --> 22:20.417
Narrator:
<i> It's a policy known</i>
<i> as "assimilation."</i>

22:23.583 --> 22:27.959
Assimilation is just--
maybe it had good meaning,

22:27.959 --> 22:29.458
maybe the intentions
were good.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.959
<i> But I think they</i>
<i> wanted us to change</i>

22:33.959 --> 22:36.000
<i> to protect themselves.</i>

22:38.792 --> 22:40.959
<i> They had a saying</i>
<i> in the military--</i>

22:40.959 --> 22:43.583
<i> "Kill the Indian</i>
<i> and save the man."</i>

22:43.583 --> 22:46.000
Which is, basically,
to take his culture away

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
and you'll be
a better person.

22:50.834 --> 22:53.458
<i> They thought</i>
<i> we were savages.</i>

23:02.709 --> 23:05.750
Narrator:
<i> After months</i>
<i> on the reservation,</i>

23:05.750 --> 23:07.583
<i> Crazy Horse</i>
<i> fears his people</i>

23:07.583 --> 23:10.458
<i> are on the verge</i>
<i> of losing their identity.</i>

23:12.041 --> 23:14.041
I think putting Indians
on reservations

23:14.041 --> 23:16.041
was a despicable part
of history...

23:18.625 --> 23:21.125
<i> because it basically</i>
<i> was attacking their soul.</i>

23:24.625 --> 23:26.667
Narrator:
<i> Now the proud Lakota warrior</i>

23:26.667 --> 23:30.583
<i> knows he needs to stand up</i>
<i> for his people once again.</i>

23:44.750 --> 23:47.041
( speaking
Lakota language )

23:49.458 --> 23:51.625
Translator:
<i> "My people are not</i>
<i> happy here.</i>

23:51.625 --> 23:53.041
I am not happy here."

23:55.792 --> 23:58.041
"We do not want to live here
on this reservation."

24:00.417 --> 24:04.083
<i> "I want what I was promised,</i>
<i> a reservation of our own,</i>

24:04.083 --> 24:05.875
<i> a place where we are free,</i>

24:05.875 --> 24:08.166
even if we are not."

24:13.750 --> 24:15.083
Life on the reservation

24:15.083 --> 24:17.625
is not what
you're accustomed to.

24:17.625 --> 24:19.166
Give it time.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.667
<i> I think you'll become</i>
<i> quite fond of it.</i>

24:21.667 --> 24:23.750
<i> ( translator speaking</i>
<i> Lakota language )</i>

25:01.667 --> 25:05.125
Narrator:
<i>Months after leading his people</i>
<i> onto a reservation,</i>

25:05.125 --> 25:08.542
<i> Crazy Horse</i>
<i> is growing restless.</i>

25:13.125 --> 25:17.750
<i> But since pleading his case</i>
<i> to U.S. authorities,</i>

25:17.750 --> 25:20.041
<i> the military now fears</i>
<i> the Lakota warrior</i>

25:20.041 --> 25:22.917
<i> could incite</i>
<i> an Indian uprising.</i>

25:24.667 --> 25:27.834
Karl Jacoby:
<i> The U.S. was incredibly scared</i>

25:27.834 --> 25:30.001
<i> about Crazy Horse.</i>

25:31.875 --> 25:35.041
There's rumors going around
that Crazy Horse

25:35.041 --> 25:38.542
wants to kill
a visiting U.S. general.

25:40.125 --> 25:43.208
<i> And U.S. authorities</i>
<i> are forever concerned</i>

25:43.208 --> 25:45.709
about these rumors
of Indian outbreaks.

25:49.166 --> 25:52.959
Narrator:
<i> As fear of Crazy Horse's</i>
<i> intention spreads,</i>

25:52.959 --> 25:54.959
<i> the Lakota warrior</i>
<i> decides to meet</i>

25:54.959 --> 25:58.125
<i> with reservation agents</i>
<i> to clear his name.</i>

26:42.583 --> 26:44.750
Jacoby:
<i> Crazy Horse thinks</i>
<i> he's going to a meeting</i>

26:44.750 --> 26:47.291
<i> with some U.S. officials.</i>

26:47.291 --> 26:50.041
He doesn't realize the magnitude
of what's about to happen.

27:04.875 --> 27:08.333
Eisenbach:
<i> They start to put him</i>
<i> into a jail cell.</i>

27:08.333 --> 27:09.959
Well, he sees--
"Wait a second.

27:09.959 --> 27:11.625
This isn't what
I came in here for."

27:11.667 --> 27:14.834
And he comes out
with knives.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.208
Agh-hh!

27:59.041 --> 28:00.375
Jacoby:
<i> Accounts here differ,</i>

28:00.375 --> 28:02.917
but I think the most
reliable interpretation

28:02.917 --> 28:04.667
is that the white U.S. sentry

28:04.667 --> 28:08.375
<i> bayonets him,</i>
<i> and he dies.</i>

28:10.959 --> 28:13.083
<i> Crazy Horse is never killed</i>
<i> in battle in that respect.</i>

28:13.125 --> 28:16.208
<i> His vision is correct.</i>

28:16.208 --> 28:18.208
He's taken
completely unawares

28:18.208 --> 28:20.792
when he's, um,
surprised by the sentry.

28:26.041 --> 28:31.291
Narrator:
<i> On September 5, 1877,</i>
<i> Crazy Horse,</i>

28:31.291 --> 28:35.417
<i> a man who fought</i>
<i> his entire life to</i>
<i> protect his people</i>

28:35.417 --> 28:39.417
<i> and won battle after battle</i>
<i>against the United States Army,</i>

28:39.417 --> 28:41.792
<i> is killed.</i>

28:41.792 --> 28:44.417
Crazy Horse's death
is hard to talk about

28:44.417 --> 28:46.875
because it's just so...

28:48.875 --> 28:51.917
fresh, even though
it's been that many years.

28:55.208 --> 28:58.291
His death...

28:58.291 --> 29:01.667
I think we all died
that day, really.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.875
Jacoby:
<i> One of the things</i>
<i> that's most fascinating</i>

29:06.875 --> 29:08.375
<i> about Crazy Horse</i>
<i> and his legacy</i>

29:08.375 --> 29:10.417
<i> is simply the fact that</i>

29:10.417 --> 29:15.166
<i> of all the many native leaders</i>
<i> across American history,</i>

29:15.208 --> 29:16.959
<i> he's one of the few people</i>

29:16.959 --> 29:19.417
<i> that most non-Indians</i>
<i> have heard about.</i>

29:19.417 --> 29:22.458
I think he's seen today
as a symbol

29:22.458 --> 29:26.333
of courageous resistance
to the U.S. government--

29:26.333 --> 29:28.875
<i> and he is,</i>
<i> in many respects.</i>

29:28.875 --> 29:30.750
<i> And I think that's</i>
<i> one of the reasons</i>

29:30.750 --> 29:32.917
<i> that makes him so powerful.</i>

29:37.458 --> 29:39.291
Narrator:
<i> With Crazy Horse gone,</i>

29:39.291 --> 29:43.417
<i> the Lakota people are in</i>
<i> desperate need of leadership</i>

29:43.417 --> 29:47.166
<i> if they're going to save</i>
<i> what's left of their culture.</i>

29:55.333 --> 29:58.083
Narrator:
<i> After years on his own,</i>
<i> Billy the Kid</i>

29:58.083 --> 30:00.750
<i> has finally found his place</i>
<i> in the West</i>

30:00.750 --> 30:03.333
<i> and a mentor</i>
<i> in John Tunstall.</i>

30:05.458 --> 30:08.959
<i> Tunstall's cattle business</i>
<i> is quickly gaining momentum</i>

30:08.959 --> 30:12.792
<i> and cutting into the interests</i>
<i> of his biggest competition...</i>

30:15.041 --> 30:17.000
<i> a group</i>
<i> of ruthless businessmen</i>

30:17.000 --> 30:18.250
<i> known as "the House."</i>

30:23.125 --> 30:26.750
Chamberlain:
<i> The House had a monopoly</i>
<i> on business,</i>

30:26.750 --> 30:28.792
<i> but then there was</i>
<i> this newcomer</i>

30:28.834 --> 30:32.083
who arrives in Lincoln
with some money behind him

30:32.083 --> 30:35.875
and the desire to kind of
take over and compete.

30:47.458 --> 30:51.542
Narrator:
<i> The House has some</i>
<i> very powerful allies,</i>

30:51.542 --> 30:53.917
<i> including one</i>
<i> of the largest landowners</i>

30:53.917 --> 30:56.250
<i> in the United States,</i>

30:56.250 --> 30:58.959
<i> Thomas Catron.</i>

30:58.959 --> 31:02.291
Chamberlain:
<i> Thomas Catron was linked</i>
<i> to the House</i>

31:02.291 --> 31:06.291
<i> because Catron</i>
<i> had loaned the House</i>
<i> a great deal of money.</i>

31:06.291 --> 31:08.417
Until the House
repaid Catron,

31:08.417 --> 31:12.250
he had a stake
in their well-being.

31:12.250 --> 31:16.333
<i> So it was in his interest</i>
<i> that they do well</i>

31:16.333 --> 31:19.417
<i> so he could get repaid.</i>

31:22.542 --> 31:26.542
Narrator:
<i>Catron owns three million acres</i>
<i> of territory,</i>

31:26.542 --> 31:31.000
<i> nearly equal in size</i>
<i> to the state of Connecticut.</i>

31:31.000 --> 31:34.583
<i> His landholdings</i>
<i> include Lincoln County,</i>

31:34.583 --> 31:38.542
<i> and Catron doesn't take kindly</i>
<i> to the new competitor</i>

31:38.542 --> 31:41.125
<i> impeding on his business.</i>

31:52.166 --> 31:53.500
This is for you.

31:56.875 --> 31:58.458
It's a writ
of attachment,

31:58.458 --> 32:01.001
authorizes you to seize
all the property

32:01.001 --> 32:04.166
of John Tunstall
and his business partners.

32:04.917 --> 32:06.375
And what if he resists?

32:08.375 --> 32:11.250
I don't care
about the means.

32:11.250 --> 32:13.875
<i> Just the results.</i>

32:13.875 --> 32:15.291
Understood.

32:56.417 --> 32:58.291
<i> ( gunshots )</i>

33:00.917 --> 33:02.333
Go check it out.

33:02.333 --> 33:04.625
- You stay here.
- Yeah.

33:15.125 --> 33:16.709
( horse whinnies )

33:19.375 --> 33:21.458
What's the rush, boys?

33:23.291 --> 33:25.375
We heard a shot.

33:25.375 --> 33:27.417
Did you, now?

33:38.250 --> 33:40.625
( gunshot )

33:42.375 --> 33:44.750
Don't do anything
stupid, son.

33:44.750 --> 33:46.417
<i> This doesn't</i>
<i> involve you.</i>

33:48.166 --> 33:51.041
I suggest you

Gardner:

33:56.542 --> 34:00.417

34:05.583 --> 34:07.583
<i> Like so many conflicts</i>
<i> in the West,</i>

34:07.583 --> 34:09.750
<i> it becomes personal.</i>

34:11.125 --> 34:12.792
Hyah!

34:12.792 --> 34:16.166
<i> Personal to the point</i>

34:28.291 --> 34:32.125
<i> And that person</i>

34:32.125 --> 34:35.500
He is murdered

Narrator:

<i> continues to expand,</i>

35:17.417 --> 35:19.625
<i> men like Billy the Kid</i>
<i> are realizing</i>

35:19.625 --> 35:22.542
<i> just how lawless</i>
<i> the frontier is.</i>

35:24.375 --> 35:28.417
<i> But over 400 miles away</i>
<i> from New Mexico,</i>

35:28.417 --> 35:31.458
<i> one man is about to</i>
<i> bring order to the West.</i>

35:37.875 --> 35:40.542
( voices overlapping )

36:10.125 --> 36:11.291
( groans )

36:21.417 --> 36:25.375
Narrator:
<i> In the plains of Kansas where</i>
<i> men take what they want...</i>

36:25.375 --> 36:29.667
<i> and every day</i>
<i> is a struggle for survival,</i>

36:29.667 --> 36:31.417
<i> no one is tougher...</i>

36:34.542 --> 36:36.333
<i> than Wyatt Earp.</i>

36:36.333 --> 36:37.875
Isenberg:
<i> Wyatt Earp was a big guy,</i>

36:37.917 --> 36:39.792
<i> he was about six feet tall</i>
<i> and he was very strong.</i>

36:39.792 --> 36:41.792
<i> He was large by</i>
<i> 19th century standards.</i>

36:41.792 --> 36:45.250
He used that size
to be imposing.

37:02.500 --> 37:05.208
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt Earp is one</i>
<i> of thousands of Americans</i>

37:05.208 --> 37:07.208
<i> who have flooded the West</i>

37:07.208 --> 37:09.458
<i> in hopes</i>
<i> of striking it rich.</i>

37:11.375 --> 37:15.709
Wyatt was bit by the incurable
Western disease.

37:15.750 --> 37:19.208
And that was the need to
always find the next frontier.

37:19.208 --> 37:22.875
<i> The frontier might be mining,</i>
<i> it might be real estate,</i>

37:22.875 --> 37:25.583
but it was the search itself,
the adventure itself.

37:25.625 --> 37:27.583
That's what
really drove Wyatt.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.417
Narrator:
<i> To get by, he's done</i>
<i> nearly every job</i>

37:34.417 --> 37:35.709
<i> on the frontier.</i>

37:37.834 --> 37:41.291
<i> From laying tracks for</i>
<i> the Union Pacific Railroad...</i>

37:42.667 --> 37:46.250
<i> to hunting buffalo</i>
<i> on the plains</i>

37:46.250 --> 37:50.542
<i> and even working</i>
<i> as a bouncer at a brothel.</i>

37:55.959 --> 37:57.667
<i> Wyatt's search for fortune</i>

37:57.667 --> 38:01.500
<i> has landed him</i>
<i> in Dodge City, Kansas,</i>

38:01.500 --> 38:03.458
<i> a place like</i>
<i> thousands of others</i>

38:03.458 --> 38:07.000
<i> popping up across the West</i>
<i> called "boomtowns."</i>

38:09.750 --> 38:13.417
<i> To move cattle</i>
<i> from wide-open plains</i>
<i> to eastern cities,</i>

38:13.417 --> 38:16.625
<i> they must first be driven</i>
<i> to railroad hubs</i>

38:16.625 --> 38:19.667
<i> that soon turn into</i>
<i> bustling towns.</i>

38:19.667 --> 38:23.542
Kirschner:
<i> A boomtown explodes</i>
<i> on the scene.</i>

38:23.542 --> 38:25.625
You had that barren landscape
and then suddenly

38:25.625 --> 38:28.500
<i> you would have</i>
<i> a hotel with 50 rooms.</i>

38:28.500 --> 38:31.250
Narrator:
<i> Boomtowns are quickly</i>
<i> populated</i>

38:31.250 --> 38:33.542
<i> by the men working</i>
<i> the cattle drive,</i>

38:33.542 --> 38:36.875
<i> a group that will become</i>
<i> synonymous with the West--</i>

38:36.917 --> 38:39.375
<i> cowboys.</i>

38:39.375 --> 38:42.458
Hutton:
<i> You have a lot of young men</i>
<i> that would get to those towns</i>

38:42.458 --> 38:44.875
<i> and they're all fueled</i>
<i> on whiskey, carrying guns.</i>

38:44.875 --> 38:48.750
So you've got young men
drinking heavily and armed.

38:48.750 --> 38:51.583
And this is, indeed, one of
the reasons the West was wild.

38:53.959 --> 38:56.000
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt sees that</i>
<i> in Dodge City</i>

38:56.000 --> 38:58.291
<i> the law is nonexistent</i>

38:58.291 --> 39:01.333
<i> and disputes are settled</i>
<i> with violence.</i>

39:01.333 --> 39:03.709
In that day, you could shoot
somebody dead in the street

39:03.709 --> 39:05.041
for looking at you
the wrong way

39:05.041 --> 39:07.417
<i> because there's</i>
<i> no repercussion.</i>

39:07.417 --> 39:09.542
It's a different time--
the values were different,

39:09.542 --> 39:10.542
life was different.

39:21.417 --> 39:22.917
Narrator:
<i> After years of moving</i>

39:22.917 --> 39:25.333
<i> from one job in the West</i>
<i> to another,</i>

39:25.333 --> 39:27.667
<i> Wyatt isn't satisfied.</i>

39:32.500 --> 39:35.583
Reynolds:
<i> It was a rough, tough life.</i>

39:35.583 --> 39:37.625
<i> And a lot of them said,</i>

39:37.625 --> 39:43.917
"I think I'll just
turn in my chaps

39:43.917 --> 39:46.500
and do something else."

39:48.792 --> 39:53.875
<i> And they'd either go back East</i>
<i> or they'd turn bad.</i>

39:53.875 --> 39:58.875
Narrator:
<i> But Wyatt Earp feels he's</i>
<i> destined for something more.</i>

39:58.875 --> 40:02.458
<i> And it's in Dodge City</i>
<i> that he demonstrates a skill</i>

40:02.458 --> 40:05.041
<i> that will mark his place</i>
<i> in history.</i>

40:12.667 --> 40:14.500
Hunter:
<i> You cheated the wrong man.</i>

40:14.500 --> 40:16.583
That's my money.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.500
The guy cheated.
The guy's a cheater, huh?

40:29.834 --> 40:31.625
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

40:38.750 --> 40:41.667
Nobody move.
He pulled his gun,
he pulled his gun.

40:41.667 --> 40:42.834
Easy does it.

40:42.834 --> 40:45.542
Nobody move!
Don't move!

40:46.583 --> 40:47.959
<i> Easy there.</i>

40:47.959 --> 40:49.583
-<i> He's a cheat. </i>
- Easy there.

40:49.583 --> 40:51.792
-<i> The guy cheated. </i>
- Put the gun away.

40:51.792 --> 40:53.625
- His gun, did you see it?
-<i> Everyone saw him</i>
<i>  reach for his gun.</i>

40:53.625 --> 40:56.417
Just hand it over.

40:56.417 --> 40:58.709
- You have to
give over your gun.
- Back off! Back off!

40:58.709 --> 41:00.709
- Take it easy.
- Back off!

41:00.709 --> 41:02.709
I'll shoot you!

41:02.709 --> 41:03.875
Come on.

41:14.417 --> 41:15.750
Narrator:
<i> The town of Dodge</i>

41:15.750 --> 41:17.792
<i> is in desperate need</i>
<i> of a lawman.</i>

41:20.083 --> 41:23.667
<i> And Wyatt Earp</i>
<i> is the perfect man</i>
<i> for the job.</i>

41:28.667 --> 41:31.458
<i> It isn't long before</i>
<i> Wyatt Earp is recruited</i>

41:31.458 --> 41:34.166
<i> to be deputy marshal</i>
<i> of Dodge City.</i>

41:36.458 --> 41:39.583
Kirschner:
<i> There was no particular</i>
<i> training for a lawman.</i>

41:39.583 --> 41:41.792
They were just people
for whom the work suited,

41:41.792 --> 41:44.667
and then there was a lot
of on-the-job training.

41:46.166 --> 41:49.125
<i> But Wyatt brought</i>
<i> a cool demeanor,</i>

41:49.125 --> 41:50.709
<i> a knowledge of people,</i>

41:50.709 --> 41:52.667
and that presence
that he had

41:52.667 --> 41:54.625
that worked on
pretty much everybody.

41:59.166 --> 42:02.001
That's not how things work
in this town.

42:04.166 --> 42:05.625
Harmon:
<i> It's all about intimidation.</i>

42:05.625 --> 42:07.083
Wyatt Earp
didn't ask questions.

42:07.125 --> 42:08.709
He'd smack you
with the barrel of his gun.

42:08.709 --> 42:10.083
"Pistol-whip,"
that comes from him.

42:14.041 --> 42:16.625
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt Earp is quickly</i>
<i> making a name for himself</i>

42:16.625 --> 42:19.083
<i> in Dodge City.</i>

42:19.083 --> 42:21.125
<i> And it's in his role</i>
<i> as a lawman</i>

42:21.125 --> 42:24.001
<i> that he will soon become</i>
<i> one of the most famous figures</i>

42:24.001 --> 42:25.834
<i> of the West.</i>
