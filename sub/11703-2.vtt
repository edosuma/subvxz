WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:02.239
Governor Ferguson's
been punishing the women

00:02.240 --> 00:04.038
for what I've done
and it's gotta stop.

00:04.040 --> 00:06.040
You're our hero!

00:06.680 --> 00:08.239
I want to see Will.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.559
Could you tell him?

00:09.560 --> 00:10.800
I'll talk to him.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.479
- Liz, hey, what's going on?
- Putting me back into general.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.360
- Out of the way!
- No! They'll tear her apart!

00:17.480 --> 00:19.360
- Slot her.
- What? You can't, no.

00:19.760 --> 00:20.960
I have to do this.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.639
What sort of human being
puts another person

00:23.640 --> 00:25.439
at risk just to prove a point?

00:25.440 --> 00:27.880
You don't run this prison,
Smith, I do.

00:28.800 --> 00:30.319
I'm in the exercise yard,
Governor.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.600
We have a situation.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.519
I'm putting an end to
our little agreement.

00:33.520 --> 00:34.680
You're on your own, Franky.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.959
Oh, fuck, the screws'll
never think

00:38.960 --> 00:40.240
of looking in there!

00:40.760 --> 00:42.039
Got a food delivery to bring in.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.439
Maybe you should have told
your mates not to start

00:43.440 --> 00:44.920
burning their gear in the yard.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.200
Get back to your units!

00:49.880 --> 00:52.200
Open the door
or Vinegar Tits gets it.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.040
You don't run this prison.

00:56.840 --> 00:57.920
I do.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.120 --> 02:04.519
Most of the women are asleep.

02:04.520 --> 02:06.040
Now would be the time to do it.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.920
Slot her?

02:08.479 --> 02:11.079
Keep the women in lockdown,
72 hours,

02:11.080 --> 02:13.440
at least till the cleaners
can take care of the mess.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.600
Will I take care of
the cleaners?

02:21.560 --> 02:23.280
Are you still in shock, Vera?

02:23.720 --> 02:24.720
No.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.360
Then why are you making all
these ridiculous suggestions?

02:30.840 --> 02:32.320
Just tell me what to do,
Governor.

02:34.400 --> 02:38.040
Bring her to the Education Unit,
quietly.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.919
You can stay, Miss Bennett.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.200
Close the door.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.080
Just a chat.

02:58.480 --> 02:59.720
Why're we meeting in here?

03:00.480 --> 03:01.720
Neutral territory.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.760
Couldn't this wait
until morning?

03:06.360 --> 03:07.479
The women will take ownership

03:07.480 --> 03:09.000
of the destruction
they've caused.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.759
I want you to direct them to
clean it up,

03:11.760 --> 03:14.079
and I want a personal guarantee
this will never happen again.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.560
Those are my demands.
What are yours?

03:19.800 --> 03:21.440
- Well?
- Um.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.439
Well, most of the damage was

03:23.440 --> 03:25.240
to the women's
personal belongings,

03:25.680 --> 03:27.440
but there was some
prison-issue stuff.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.160
Um, bedding, mattresses,
that'll need to be replaced.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.280
When the budget allows,
they will be.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.641
What are they gonna
sleep on until then?

03:34.960 --> 03:37.159
The women need to understand
that they only hurt themselves

03:37.160 --> 03:38.359
with this behaviour.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.760
May I suggest you think small.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.119
All right.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.799
For starters,
it doesn't cost anything

03:44.800 --> 03:46.400
to reinstate privileges.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.320
That's non-negotiable.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.840
You can phase in
the smoking ban gradually,

03:51.000 --> 03:52.559
give the women a chance
to adjust.

03:52.560 --> 03:55.520
Agreed, anything else?

03:56.640 --> 03:57.640
Yeah.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.280
Oh, cheese, the cheese!

04:05.080 --> 04:06.360
Here you go, girls.

04:06.560 --> 04:07.680
I'm starving.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.359
Pizza for breakfast!

04:09.360 --> 04:11.240
That's one thing
I haven't done before.

04:12.760 --> 04:13.919
I'll have that one.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.519
Thanks, Bea. Thanks, Bea!

04:16.519 --> 04:17.920
Thanks, Bea.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.440
That's a coup.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.760
Trash the place and
get to order in.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.280
- Help yourself.
- I'll pass, thanks.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.880
I try not to mix
saturated fats and bribes.

04:36.280 --> 04:37.680
It's rewarding them.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.560
That is no reward,
that is reparations.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.999
We severely underestimated
Smith's hold over the women.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.640
We won't make
that mistake again.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.959
I can only wonder what
the board might think.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.480
The board will think
it was a minor incident,

04:52.880 --> 04:54.160
which we contained.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.520
This is bloody grouse, Bea.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.120
Eat up, enjoy it!

05:03.040 --> 05:04.959
How can she sit there
and just stuff her face

05:04.960 --> 05:06.960
like that after what
she's done to Liz?

05:07.120 --> 05:08.640
Just think of it
as a last supper.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.839
Hey, food delivery's still stuck
in the sally port.

05:14.840 --> 05:15.999
We've gotta bring it
up to the kitchen.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.880
Yeah, cool.
Chickens out first?

05:18.560 --> 05:19.560
Yeah.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.080
Not having any?

05:22.560 --> 05:23.959
Not her pizza.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.560
Hey, let's get back to work,
bubble butt.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.600
Enjoy your pizza, Booms.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.280
You've got two minutes.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.040
Was it worth it?

05:53.720 --> 05:54.880
Killing Braden?

05:55.960 --> 05:57.720
Does it make you feel better?

05:59.160 --> 06:01.000
Yeah, it does.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.959
But I didn't want
to involve you, Liz,

06:06.960 --> 06:07.960
I really didn't.

06:08.280 --> 06:12.240
What do they call me?
What? Oh, collateral damage.

06:13.160 --> 06:14.480
That's it, isn't it?

06:15.080 --> 06:17.759
No, I didn't see it like that...

06:17.760 --> 06:19.240
No, you didn't.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.240
You fucked up any chance I had
of a life with my kids.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.360
Call to duty, please.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.400
Sorry.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.759
The art
of negotiation is to begin

06:53.760 --> 06:55.480
with the things you agree on.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.359
Smith wants to improve
these women, so do I.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.440
We just come at it
from different angles.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.200
There's some programs
I want her to reinstate.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.840
It'd be in her interests,
make her look good.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.399
She still
sees herself as better

07:10.400 --> 07:13.280
than this place, better than
all the women around her.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.480
She wants to prove that,
even to us.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.280
Pathetic.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.360
I guarantee you
she kept a neat house.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.920
I think we start with something
close to this woman's heart.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.999
Say you get all these things...

07:31.000 --> 07:32.320
What do I give in return?

07:35.560 --> 07:37.361
Rotary's on route
from the Gate House.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.400
Tasty.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.639
Uh, that's disgusting.

07:48.640 --> 07:49.839
Yuck.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.400
What is that smell?

08:13.400 --> 08:14.880
Those chickens are off.

08:15.640 --> 08:16.680
Are they?

08:17.080 --> 08:18.959
You're telling me you can't
smell that? Get rid of them.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.000
Okay.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.800
Actually, no.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.479
You stay and continue
with the food.

08:25.480 --> 08:29.759
You two, all of those, down
to the garbage compactor.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.600
Cindy Lou says
her back is no good.

08:34.120 --> 08:35.720
Then you can do it by yourself.

08:37.480 --> 08:38.919
You're right, Miss Bennett.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.480
They are a little festy.

08:43.320 --> 08:44.760
Ah, that, too!

08:56.600 --> 08:59.000
Are you familiar with
the Food Safety Regulations?

08:59.320 --> 09:00.360
- Yes.
- Hmm.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.039
We're gonna go through
the whole delivery together,

09:02.040 --> 09:03.400
box by box, come on.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.200
So, thanks for everything.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.759
I feel a lot better, I don't
look crash hot, but yeah.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.199
You just take care of yourself.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.319
Yeah, I will, Rose. Thanks.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.680
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.319
Bea asked me to make sure
you got back to the unit okay.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.120
Oh, right. This can't
go on forever, can it?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.240
Just a little longer yet.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.000
Look out, here comes
the fuckin' lagger.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.320
Everything all right here?

09:39.400 --> 09:42.120
Hello, Miss Miles.
You look lovely today.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.440
Your daughter's
applied to visit you.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.559
You just need to sign here
and approve it,

09:47.560 --> 09:48.840
and I'll get it through quickly.

10:00.760 --> 10:05.040
No, no. I'm not gonna let her
see me like this. No.

10:06.760 --> 10:09.400
Okay, I'm gonna help you
cover those up.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.239
Oh, love, thanks, but no, no.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.799
Look, Sophie'd
be happy to see you

10:14.800 --> 10:16.760
no matter what you
looked like, Liz.

10:17.160 --> 10:20.280
Oh, God, Dor. Look at me!

10:20.880 --> 10:23.080
Soph deserves better than this.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.320
Maxine?

10:28.440 --> 10:29.560
Hey.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.280
This is all your fault.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.160
Oh, shit.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.360
You know what?
You can blame me for that,

10:41.720 --> 10:43.559
but you can't blame me for,
what, the last seven years

10:43.560 --> 10:45.279
of you refusing to
see your own kids.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.359
- It's just another excuse, Liz.
- Oh, piss off.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.839
No, you turn your back
on Sophie now...

10:48.840 --> 10:50.359
I am not turning my back on her!

10:50.360 --> 10:51.481
What, you're protecting her?

10:51.720 --> 10:54.560
Yeah, but that's something
you'd know nothing about.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.879
I bet it took a lot for Sophie

11:09.880 --> 11:11.360
to get in contact
with you again.

11:12.240 --> 11:14.080
But you refuse to see her now,

11:14.960 --> 11:18.560
you may never see her again!

11:19.160 --> 11:20.360
Maxine.

12:25.140 --> 12:26.339
Excuse me, Governor,

12:26.340 --> 12:28.459
I have staff credit union
release forms

12:28.460 --> 12:29.740
for Matthew Fletcher.

12:31.980 --> 12:33.340
You just need to sign them.

12:37.020 --> 12:38.220
And how is Mr. Fletcher?

12:38.380 --> 12:40.500
I haven't seen him for months.
I really wouldn't know.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.140
If you sing to bubs, it'll kick.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.379
- Really?
- Yeah. You wanna have a go?

12:48.380 --> 12:50.380
- Put your hand here.
- Okay.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.060
- Okay, you got a song?
- Uh...

13:01.140 --> 13:04.659
Oh, did you feel that?
Keep going!

13:13.940 --> 13:16.660
Oh, it's a little kick!

13:17.220 --> 13:19.019
Hey, hey, Dor, I heard you,

13:19.020 --> 13:20.740
you lost your
shampoo in the riot.

13:20.940 --> 13:22.419
You can have mine,
I don't need it anyway.

13:22.420 --> 13:25.220
Just stick up your ass, Boom.
I don't want nothin' from you.

13:27.460 --> 13:29.259
I got seven years
'cause of that bitch.

13:29.260 --> 13:30.299
I don't care.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.739
Yeah, well you would care if you

13:31.740 --> 13:33.459
got seven more years,
wouldn't ya!

13:33.460 --> 13:34.700
Hey.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.540
Serves me fuckin' right
for trying to be nice.

13:37.780 --> 13:41.300
Okay, mail time, ladies.

13:43.020 --> 13:45.620
Smith, for you.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.220
Someone thinks you're a hero.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.900
Anything for me, Mr. J?

13:50.180 --> 13:51.260
No, sorry, Boomer.

13:51.780 --> 13:52.820
Oh, yeah, that'd be right.

13:53.020 --> 13:55.140
Dumb fuck family.
Can't read, can't write, eh?

13:56.180 --> 13:58.139
- Dor.
- Thanks.

13:58.140 --> 13:59.900
- God!
- What? What is it?

14:00.300 --> 14:02.259
Some lady, Kaz Proctor.

14:02.260 --> 14:03.419
Jess.

14:03.420 --> 14:05.140
Some nutcase wants
to come visit me.

14:05.660 --> 14:07.100
Don't think so.

14:08.060 --> 14:09.499
So you wanna tell me
what's in this one

14:09.500 --> 14:10.739
before I read it, Mr. Jackson?

14:10.740 --> 14:12.619
Congrats on the sale of
your house.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.060
Governor wants to see you.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.219
I am worried about it

14:18.220 --> 14:20.219
and I'm sure you are.
The level of drug use

14:20.220 --> 14:21.619
in this facility.

14:21.620 --> 14:22.900
Yeah, well, I think
bringing back

14:22.940 --> 14:25.020
the drug rehab programs would be
a really good start.

14:25.380 --> 14:27.900
Well, a better start would be
to halt the supply altogether.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.260
We both know who
we're talking about.

14:31.820 --> 14:33.700
Isn't it coming from
a number of sources?

14:33.900 --> 14:35.380
One more than most.

14:35.580 --> 14:38.419
Oh, no, Lizzie Birdsworth
helped you out once

14:38.420 --> 14:39.860
and look what happened to her.

14:40.060 --> 14:43.060
Birdsworth was indiscreet,
to her peril.

14:44.140 --> 14:45.619
I'm still interested
in bringing charges

14:45.620 --> 14:48.059
against her attacker,
whomever that might be.

14:48.060 --> 14:49.260
You don't know?

14:49.900 --> 14:51.700
No. Do you?

14:52.860 --> 14:53.900
No.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.819
Well then, we're agreed,
that a drug-free Wentworth

14:57.820 --> 15:00.459
is better for the women
than the opposite, yes?

15:00.460 --> 15:03.219
Yeah, the drug programs
reinstated

15:03.220 --> 15:05.500
and the recidivist programs
reinstated as well.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.940
They're good, good ideas.

15:10.940 --> 15:13.460
So let's talk about
the drug supply.

15:14.500 --> 15:15.699
Lag on Franky?

15:15.700 --> 15:16.940
That's what she wants.

15:17.260 --> 15:18.300
I'm gonna do it.

15:19.140 --> 15:20.539
No, you're not.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.300
Why, because I had
an agreement with Franky?

15:24.820 --> 15:26.099
If I did break it,
how many women

15:26.100 --> 15:27.500
do you reckon'll
fall in behind her?

15:28.020 --> 15:29.459
Enough to make things difficult.

15:29.460 --> 15:32.499
Come on, Bea, there's a
client base for a start.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.219
You think they're gonna be
happy to lose their supplier?

15:34.220 --> 15:35.619
If I keep negotiating
with Ferguson,

15:35.620 --> 15:37.139
then we can make a difference.

15:37.140 --> 15:38.740
Make this shithole...

15:42.460 --> 15:45.060
You lag on Franky
and it gets out,

15:45.860 --> 15:47.820
you'll have no credibility
with the women.

15:48.060 --> 15:50.619
And that's probably
what Ferguson wants.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.461
She wants to take me
and Franky out in one hit.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.299
It makes sense.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.780
Fuck her.

16:00.900 --> 16:01.980
Hey!

16:04.940 --> 16:06.460
Move in with me.

16:09.420 --> 16:10.940
- Why?
- Why not?

16:12.340 --> 16:15.140
You're there nearly
every night anyway, so,

16:15.460 --> 16:16.580
it sort of makes sense.

16:16.980 --> 16:19.140
The sensible angle, so romantic.

16:19.260 --> 16:21.220
I'm pretty sure
those orgasms aren't fake.

16:22.180 --> 16:23.500
Most of the time?

16:23.980 --> 16:26.220
- When?
- Well, you'll never know.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.660
I don't believe you.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.901
Mr. Jackson,
can I speak with you?

16:37.820 --> 16:39.339
We'll continue
this conversation later.

16:39.340 --> 16:40.380
Okay.

16:44.260 --> 16:45.380
What is it?

16:47.620 --> 16:51.100
Strictly between us, I have been
checking in on Mr. Fletcher.

16:52.140 --> 16:53.820
Is that a state secret?

16:55.300 --> 16:57.380
- I'd just prefer it that way...
- What does he want?

16:57.540 --> 16:59.099
He's been calling me every day,

16:59.100 --> 17:00.379
and I'm thinking of
changing my number.

17:00.380 --> 17:05.460
He's... he's changed,
I think it would help him.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.260
People don't change, Vera.

17:10.220 --> 17:12.460
See, they find out who they are
and they get scared.

17:13.220 --> 17:14.419
So whatever he said to you,

17:14.420 --> 17:16.099
that's fear talking,
that's all that is.

17:18.020 --> 17:19.299
I said I'd ask.

17:19.300 --> 17:22.180
Okay. Well, you can pass
a message on for me.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.339
Tell him to stop calling me.

17:34.580 --> 17:38.019
Cindy Lou says she only pays
once happy-lucky in her hand.

17:38.020 --> 17:39.980
Well, tell Cindy Lou,
it's cash up front.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.740
I lost the last delivery
'cause of the riot.

17:42.860 --> 17:44.540
I don't have the cash
to cover everyone.

17:54.860 --> 17:57.300
Five grams of speed
and a couple of eckies.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.940
All right, five grams of bogan
and two eckies for Juice.

18:00.420 --> 18:01.899
How long's this gonna take?

18:01.900 --> 18:02.939
Tomorrow.

18:02.940 --> 18:04.820
Cindy Lou says okay.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.980
Big order,
you better not fuck up.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.260
All right, wait your turn.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.339
What are you waiting for,
a fuckin' receipt?

18:25.380 --> 18:27.500
- Hi, Jodie.
- Hi.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.220
You're bringing drugs in here?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.700
Um, am I?

18:37.060 --> 18:38.939
You're aware of
my position on that?

18:38.940 --> 18:40.700
Ah, yep.

18:41.460 --> 18:42.820
And what is that?

18:43.420 --> 18:46.980
You're, uh...
You're anti-drugs?

18:50.180 --> 18:51.699
And yet here we are.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.140
No, I'm not really
that involved.

18:53.540 --> 18:57.179
Hey, how long do you
think you could've gone on

18:57.180 --> 19:00.020
without giving me my cut? Hmm?

19:00.460 --> 19:01.779
Now, I know you and
Franky are bringing it

19:01.780 --> 19:03.060
in through the kitchen.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.140
What I want to you tell me now
is when the next shipment's due.

19:05.780 --> 19:07.060
I can't.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.700
What the fuck!

19:10.100 --> 19:13.900
- What?
- This afternoon.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.339
- Hmm?
- Fuck.

19:16.340 --> 19:17.780
With the meat delivery.

19:18.140 --> 19:20.500
What part of
the meat delivery, huh?

19:21.540 --> 19:22.659
- Chicken.
- Bullshit!

19:22.660 --> 19:23.900
I'm not lying!

19:24.740 --> 19:27.220
Look, it's the one face
down in the box, all right?

19:28.700 --> 19:30.060
That'll have the gear in it.

19:31.140 --> 19:33.939
Right, now you're not
going to tell anyone

19:33.940 --> 19:35.419
about our little conversation.

19:35.420 --> 19:36.860
You breathe a word
of this to Franky,

19:37.420 --> 19:38.740
you know what I'm capable of.

19:46.740 --> 19:48.659
This is going to add years
to her sentence.

19:48.660 --> 19:50.060
You think
I haven't thought of that?

19:50.700 --> 19:51.740
Fuck.

19:58.620 --> 20:00.419
You all right? You seem quiet.

20:00.420 --> 20:03.779
Yeah, yes, I'm fine.

20:03.780 --> 20:05.140
All right.

20:10.660 --> 20:12.259
You fuckin' bitch!

20:12.260 --> 20:13.380
Yeah, here we go.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.059
You're gonna pay
for this, bitch! Get off me!

20:15.060 --> 20:16.259
I didn't do it!

20:16.260 --> 20:18.300
Come on, ladies.
Keep it to yourselves, come on.

20:18.660 --> 20:19.980
Go.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.699
Move away, come on.

20:22.700 --> 20:23.899
Yep, yep.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.300
God, you'd better be there,
Burnsy.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.020
Nice.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.340
This one can't fuck up.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.919
Get a look at you.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.960
You're all grown up,
you're beautiful.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.560
Sit down?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.439
Oh, love, this looks
a lot worse than it is.

21:25.440 --> 21:26.479
What happened?

21:26.480 --> 21:30.639
Oh, nothing, it...
Hey, how's Artie?

21:30.640 --> 21:32.279
- Mum...
- He must be big now.

21:32.280 --> 21:35.280
Is he doing all right at school,
and with the cricket, and...

21:36.680 --> 21:40.600
- Yeah.
- Good, that's good.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.080
Why are you here?

21:52.440 --> 21:53.839
Didn't you want me to come?

21:53.840 --> 21:55.320
Oh, of course, love.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.360
I used to dream
about you all the time.

22:04.400 --> 22:09.000
I'd wake up and think that
you'd just left the room.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.480
Like you'd actually
been there, you know?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.480
But you weren't.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.320
And then I saw you that night,
outside the pub.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.200
You stopped that guy.

22:28.280 --> 22:32.120
But then you were gone. Again.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.720
I thought you were out.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.920
What happened?

22:39.760 --> 22:42.160
Soph, I, uh...

22:47.240 --> 22:48.840
I'm sorry, love.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.520
It's just better
you don't come here.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.800
What the fuck
are you doing here?

23:28.480 --> 23:29.880
Finish it.

23:30.680 --> 23:31.840
What?

23:32.080 --> 23:34.640
I want you to finish it, go on.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.880
Get your seven years' worth.

23:39.440 --> 23:41.000
Are you fuckin' mental?

23:44.400 --> 23:47.320
Fuck off! Fuck off!

23:48.760 --> 23:50.160
I'm sorry.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.760
Sorry.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.520
Sorry.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.359
You shouldn't be sitting
out here by yourself, Liz.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.839
- Hey.
- Hey. Did you see Sophie?

24:13.840 --> 24:15.759
- Yeah.
- How'd it go?

24:15.760 --> 24:18.879
It was good, yeah.
She seemed really, really well.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.759
Oh, good.
I knew you wouldn't regret it.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.039
She woulda loved it too,
you know?

24:23.040 --> 24:25.479
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, Liz?

24:25.480 --> 24:26.479
Yeah?

24:26.480 --> 24:27.919
I still haven't
decided who should be

24:27.920 --> 24:30.040
my alternate carer,
you know, when bub comes.

24:30.640 --> 24:33.279
Would you?
Look, you've had kids.

24:33.280 --> 24:36.599
You know all about that stuff,
and you're a great mum.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.959
I'm not a....
I'm, no... I don't...

24:38.960 --> 24:40.600
I don't need to be
alternate carer.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.839
What? Why?

24:43.840 --> 24:45.559
Why don't you get
little Jess to do it?

24:45.560 --> 24:48.040
I reckon... I reckon she'd be
great at that sorta thing.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.920
I'd do it, Dor, I'd love to.

24:51.280 --> 24:53.960
Oh, look, thanks, Jess,
you've been great and all, but

24:54.320 --> 24:55.760
Liz is like my Mum.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.720
Can you just think about it?

24:59.520 --> 25:01.760
No. No, I don't need to.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.839
If she doesn't change her mind,
you know,

25:06.840 --> 25:08.960
I'd so love to be there
for you and the baby.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.840
It'd mean so much to me.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.040
Thanks, Jess.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.239
Okay, delivery truck's here.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.440
Who's feeling strong?

25:20.040 --> 25:21.159
Yep.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.279
I'll do it.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.640
Good. Come on. Let's go.

25:28.600 --> 25:29.879
The aim is to
intercept the shipment

25:29.880 --> 25:32.039
when it is in the possession
of Franky Doyle.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.479
Our information is
that the contraband

25:33.480 --> 25:35.039
is secreted inside the poultry.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.200
Any questions?

26:02.120 --> 26:03.760
Okay, all done.

26:07.840 --> 26:09.719
When you're
finished up report back to base.

26:09.720 --> 26:11.839
Miss Miles, I need
to go to the ladies.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.120
- Take her, will you?
- Yep.

26:24.520 --> 26:25.760
Oi!

26:34.120 --> 26:35.680
- She's taking it.
- Let's go.

26:45.520 --> 26:47.120
Stay where you are, Doyle.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.800
Put that down.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.560
Hands out.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.040
What's that?

27:07.200 --> 27:08.280
It's giblets.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.719
Put that out on the bench.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.120
Check everything.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.200
Once you're finished here,
toss the kitchen worker's cells,

27:19.440 --> 27:20.720
and all of H2.

27:32.840 --> 27:34.680
Just go easy, Miss.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.240
Go on. Waste of time.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.760
Governor?

28:15.560 --> 28:17.119
Anything you'd like to say,
Spiteri?

28:17.120 --> 28:18.600
That's not mine!

28:18.920 --> 28:20.079
Slot her.

28:20.080 --> 28:22.439
That's bullshit.
That's not mine!

28:22.440 --> 28:24.041
Enough of that.
Come on. Let's go.

28:24.600 --> 28:25.919
This is crap!

28:25.920 --> 28:29.639
That's not mine,
I didn't even do anything!

28:29.640 --> 28:31.760
I hate my cell being
tossed for no good reason.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.241
I hope you didn't have
anything to do with it.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.320
Back at ya.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.720
So, Jodes was ripping you off?

28:48.880 --> 28:50.439
No, I don't know.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.679
Fuckin' little bitch!

28:51.680 --> 28:53.640
I said I don't know, fuck.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.759
You know I'd never do
that to you, don't ya?

28:55.760 --> 28:56.960
Yes.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.079
Oh, well, at least it wasn't
your own money this time, eh?

29:00.080 --> 29:02.359
Yeah, I'm expecting everyone
to be really cool about that.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.560
Yeah.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.799
Oh, fuck, they're gonna want
their money back, aren't they?

29:05.800 --> 29:07.879
No shit, Sherlock, yeah.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.119
Don't worry.
I got your stash still.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.880
- It's all right.
- It's not gonna be enough.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.000
So what are you gonna do?

29:14.400 --> 29:15.639
I don't know.

29:15.640 --> 29:17.719
Look, I reckon this
next little bit's

29:17.720 --> 29:18.919
going to be tricky.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.241
I'm gonna need you
to stick close.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.319
I love ya. I'm not gonna let
nothin' happen to ya, am I?

29:22.320 --> 29:25.880
- Yeah, so who else we got?
- Um...

29:40.160 --> 29:41.240
Chinky chonks.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.560
Cindy Lou is not happy.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.040
She wants her happy-lucky.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.319
Well, she's gonna get it.

29:46.320 --> 29:48.199
She just has to wait
like everybody else.

29:54.760 --> 29:56.719
Cindy Lou's very reasonable.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.880
Every day
she doesn't get the gear,

29:59.080 --> 30:01.239
ten percent on money you owe.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.239
That's fuckin' bullshit.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.439
That's not gonna happen.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.960
I tell her that,
she'll get very angry.

30:05.280 --> 30:08.239
Ah, well, Cindy fuckin' Lou
will just fuckin'

30:08.240 --> 30:09.839
have to wait, won't she?

30:09.840 --> 30:11.040
Now fuck off!

30:15.720 --> 30:17.199
What the fuck did you just say?

30:17.200 --> 30:18.959
She said clit-licking,
woman-loving

30:18.960 --> 30:20.400
piece of shit assfuck.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.080
Screws!

30:24.880 --> 30:26.520
You're dead, Franky.

30:26.640 --> 30:28.640
How's she gonna get her
happy-lucky if I'm dead?

30:29.600 --> 30:30.880
Have a think.

30:41.800 --> 30:44.120
Call for the medical, over.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.760
Oh, Kay, Kay, this is Liz,
please don't hang up.

30:53.280 --> 30:54.360
I...

30:57.040 --> 31:00.519
Um, I...
I need to speak to Sophie

31:00.520 --> 31:03.079
because she...
she came and saw me,

31:03.080 --> 31:05.040
and I did...
I did a terrible thing.

31:08.440 --> 31:09.640
Right.

31:11.280 --> 31:15.200
Can... Can you just tell her
that I love her

31:15.840 --> 31:17.520
and that I'm sorry?

31:18.200 --> 31:21.720
Please just tell her
that from me, okay?

31:24.480 --> 31:25.560
Ta.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.140
Hi, see you later.

32:00.220 --> 32:02.699
You are so beautiful.

32:02.700 --> 32:04.579
So, you gonna come
back to my place later?

32:06.060 --> 32:08.420
Ah, I'm working late, but yeah,
I might crash.

32:08.740 --> 32:10.780
You thought any more
about my offer?

32:11.540 --> 32:13.459
I didn't say I was
gonna think about it.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.900
Why not? We're good, aren't we?

32:16.300 --> 32:17.740
Yeah, we are.

32:19.140 --> 32:23.100
But you know, you...
You've still got stuff.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.780
What d'ya mean?

32:33.340 --> 32:35.660
Meg, and what
happened with Fletch.

32:35.780 --> 32:37.380
Yeah, well, I'm past all that.

32:38.100 --> 32:39.979
You're not past all that.

32:39.980 --> 32:41.739
I can't imagine
how you've managed

32:41.740 --> 32:43.620
- to deal with...
- Then don't try.

32:45.340 --> 32:48.099
I'm just saying nicely,
and we're good

32:48.100 --> 32:49.419
and I want us to work,

32:49.420 --> 32:52.140
but it's not enough to just say
you're past it.

32:52.900 --> 32:55.180
You still have
a lot of anger in you.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.980
You need to deal with
a few things, directly.

32:58.700 --> 33:00.100
What, like therapy?

33:00.620 --> 33:01.739
Well, if that feels right...

33:01.740 --> 33:02.980
Well, it doesn't.

33:04.860 --> 33:08.780
Well, maybe you
should talk to Fletch.

33:09.900 --> 33:11.379
He wants to say sorry.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.219
Maybe... Maybe hearing him out
will help the both of you.

33:13.220 --> 33:15.500
He's a fuckin' retard now, okay?

33:15.820 --> 33:17.820
Because of the accident,
he's fucked.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.900
I wanted Doyle.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.940
You wanted the supply.

33:28.220 --> 33:30.021
If you wanted Franky,
you should have said so.

33:30.460 --> 33:32.540
She will just open
another supply route.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.939
She'll want to do
that rather quickly.

33:34.940 --> 33:37.060
I understand she's
in hock to Cindy Lou,

33:37.740 --> 33:38.980
among others.

33:40.020 --> 33:42.540
You are not my only
source of information.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.020
You wanna stop Franky?

33:47.940 --> 33:49.380
Her parole's coming up, yeah?

33:50.380 --> 33:51.739
You make sure nothing
stands in the way

33:51.740 --> 33:53.179
of her getting it,
and when she goes,

33:53.180 --> 33:54.339
the problem goes with her.

33:54.340 --> 33:55.739
You're not suggesting
she be allowed

33:55.740 --> 33:57.979
to traffic drugs with impunity
until her release?

33:57.980 --> 34:01.300
No, and I can
guarantee you she won't.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.739
- How?
- With your help.

34:18.620 --> 34:20.139
Righto, I'm here.

34:20.739 --> 34:22.139
What's going on?

34:23.260 --> 34:24.820
Hey, where's the screws?

34:25.340 --> 34:27.139
- Dunno.
- Cindy Lou is here.

34:27.540 --> 34:29.018
What do you want?

34:29.020 --> 34:30.540
You wanted me, here I am.

34:31.219 --> 34:32.699
Thanks for coming, everyone.

34:33.540 --> 34:34.820
I'll make it quick.

34:35.300 --> 34:37.860
You all know my stand
on drugs and why.

34:38.100 --> 34:41.540
See, Jodie knew, lucky
the screws got to her first.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.978
Now, I've had a talk
with Ferguson,

34:43.980 --> 34:46.139
and she's gonna reinstate
the drug rehab program,

34:46.139 --> 34:50.820
so as of now, there's no more
drug trade in here, all right?

34:51.540 --> 34:54.059
Now you go against that,
you go against me.

34:54.060 --> 34:55.900
In any way, there's
gonna be consequences.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.140
Now I'll go to the wall for
every single one of you,

34:59.540 --> 35:01.340
but if you fuck me around....

35:12.860 --> 35:14.540
What the fuck are you doing?

35:15.420 --> 35:16.619
Help her.

35:16.620 --> 35:18.419
Fuck off! Fuck off!

35:18.420 --> 35:20.220
What are you doing?

35:22.260 --> 35:23.899
Don't do anything to her face!

35:23.900 --> 35:25.579
What the fuck's going on?

35:25.580 --> 35:28.059
Get the fuck off! Let go of me!

35:28.060 --> 35:31.379
Put 'em in, both of them.

35:31.380 --> 35:32.820
No.

35:33.420 --> 35:36.219
Why?
I didn't do anything.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.419
I'm not doing anything.

35:39.420 --> 35:40.579
I didn't bring any drugs in.

35:40.580 --> 35:42.140
Now, what did I say about Liz?

35:42.340 --> 35:43.579
What?

35:43.580 --> 35:46.700
Did I or did I not ask you
to leave her alone?

35:47.940 --> 35:50.619
- Boomer?
- Yes, yes.

35:50.620 --> 35:53.259
Bea, Bea, you don't
have to do this.

35:53.260 --> 35:55.340
She's a fuckin' lagger.
She knew the rules.

35:55.940 --> 35:58.019
You knew that you
should stay away from her,

35:58.020 --> 35:59.339
but you didn't, did you?

35:59.340 --> 36:00.460
Help me, Franky.

36:01.180 --> 36:02.739
Just stop her.

36:02.740 --> 36:03.859
Stop her, Franky.
Stop her.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.379
You went against me, Boomer.

36:05.380 --> 36:07.780
No, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

36:07.940 --> 36:10.339
Please, please, Franky, please.

36:10.340 --> 36:12.019
Please, please, no.

36:12.020 --> 36:13.779
Please, please, please, please.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.380
Franky, please help.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.419
Help me. Stop her.
No, no, no, no!

36:38.540 --> 36:40.740
It hurts! It hurts!

36:41.340 --> 36:42.740
Can you get
yourself to medical?

36:43.020 --> 36:44.939
- Yeah.
- Off you go, then.

36:44.940 --> 36:49.940
My hands. Oh, jeez, it hurts.
It's hurting, it's hurting!

36:51.740 --> 36:55.940
Out of the way. It hurts.

36:57.260 --> 36:59.060
Will somebody help her?

36:59.300 --> 37:02.700
Oh, God, it hurts.

37:03.740 --> 37:05.459
Now anyone got
a problem with another woman

37:05.460 --> 37:06.859
and is thinking of
taking retribution,

37:06.860 --> 37:08.419
you can think again.

37:08.420 --> 37:10.140
Everything goes
through me first.

37:11.140 --> 37:14.580
Nothing happens until
I say so, all right?

37:15.380 --> 37:16.459
All right?

37:16.460 --> 37:17.620
Yes.

37:18.940 --> 37:20.500
Well, back to work.

37:51.740 --> 37:53.100
I'll leave you there.

37:54.620 --> 37:55.740
Will.

37:56.340 --> 37:57.340
Mate.

37:59.260 --> 38:00.780
Thanks for coming.

38:03.540 --> 38:05.900
Physio reckons I'm doing good.

38:07.140 --> 38:09.140
I don't know if I believe her.

38:12.140 --> 38:14.220
Well, you've got the punishment
you were looking for.

38:15.940 --> 38:17.740
You want my forgiveness?
Okay.

38:18.660 --> 38:19.860
I forgive you.

38:20.140 --> 38:21.620
I'm s-s-sorry.

38:22.340 --> 38:24.419
You only fucked Meg
because she let you.

38:24.420 --> 38:25.820
Don't know why she did.

38:26.740 --> 38:28.740
And you're only sorry
'cause I found out.

38:29.860 --> 38:31.140
I've moved on.

38:32.140 --> 38:33.940
I don't think about it
anymore, Fletch.

38:34.060 --> 38:35.860
I wish it could be different,

38:36.660 --> 38:37.660
Will.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.620
It is what it is.

38:47.060 --> 38:48.140
Sorry.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.340
Don't call me anymore.

39:23.340 --> 39:25.140
That your way of saying sorry?

39:26.340 --> 39:27.540
Yep.

39:32.060 --> 39:35.020
Why didn't you stop her?

39:39.020 --> 39:40.500
I couldn't.

39:41.860 --> 39:43.100
No.

39:44.980 --> 39:46.140
Yeah...

39:46.780 --> 39:48.020
You could.

39:51.660 --> 39:54.060
You could, you just...
You stand up.

39:54.940 --> 39:58.420
You stand up and you help.

39:59.940 --> 40:01.739
And you don't give
a fuck what happens,

40:01.740 --> 40:04.019
'cause, 'cause you're not
gonna let nothin' happen

40:04.020 --> 40:05.660
to someone that you love.

40:10.340 --> 40:13.340
'Cause I love you, Franky.

40:14.540 --> 40:17.580
I love you,
but you never loved me.

40:18.140 --> 40:21.300
You know, I would,
I would do anything for you.

40:21.540 --> 40:24.180
Anything.
But you give nothing back,

40:24.460 --> 40:26.020
'cause you're shit.

40:27.100 --> 40:28.820
You are shit!

40:29.540 --> 40:32.339
You are shit!

40:32.340 --> 40:36.660
- I'm sorry, Booms.
- Get out!

40:37.700 --> 40:38.200
Go!

40:59.620 --> 41:01.260
Doesn't wash off.

41:13.020 --> 41:15.019
You know, I thought
we had an agreement.

41:15.020 --> 41:17.419
We stay out of each other's way
and there'd be no trouble.

41:17.420 --> 41:19.739
Yeah, we did have an agreement,
and I honoured that.

41:19.740 --> 41:22.739
You're still standing here,
but things change.

41:22.740 --> 41:25.100
If I find you bringing
drugs into this prison,

41:25.340 --> 41:27.541
it won't be your hands that
get put in that steam press.

41:27.700 --> 41:29.299
You're a natural, aren't ya?

41:29.300 --> 41:30.660
Just rolls off the tongue.

41:36.140 --> 41:37.620
Your parole's coming up, yeah?

41:37.820 --> 41:39.420
That's where you want to be
putting your energies.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.539
You know what,
you're worse than Jacs

41:41.540 --> 41:43.420
'cause you think
it's all for a good cause.

41:44.340 --> 41:46.020
Your type's the worst.

42:00.340 --> 42:03.260
And exhale, dip your back,

42:04.260 --> 42:07.500
and inhale, arch your back.

42:09.020 --> 42:11.500
Oh, this feels ridiculous.

42:13.460 --> 42:14.939
Repeat after me:

42:14.940 --> 42:17.539
"There is plenty of space
for me and my baby."

42:19.340 --> 42:21.820
Come on, Doreen, you've
gotta take this seriously.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.979
We have to prepare
you for the birth.

42:23.980 --> 42:25.060
- Okay.
- Hey, look.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.299
Basically you're gonna feel
like you want to do a big poo.

42:27.300 --> 42:28.380
- What?
- Yeah.

42:28.540 --> 42:30.339
Didn't they tell you
that in prenatal classes?

42:30.340 --> 42:31.900
No, must have forgot that bit.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.619
- Keep going, Doreen.
- Okay.

42:34.620 --> 42:35.979
You clenching
your butt muscles?

42:35.980 --> 42:37.739
- Yep, I'm clenching.
- Good.

42:37.740 --> 42:42.739
I'm stretching and
breathing, and exhale...

42:42.740 --> 42:45.540
Oh, my God!

42:48.300 --> 42:51.299
- Oh, that is awful!
- It's hurting.

42:51.300 --> 42:54.179
I'm sorry.
Oh, that is gross.

42:54.180 --> 42:56.020
Hey Dor, hey, listen, listen.

42:57.140 --> 42:58.619
Do you still want
me holding your hand

42:58.620 --> 43:00.020
when you have the baby?

43:00.980 --> 43:03.779
Yeah, of course.

43:03.780 --> 43:05.499
Just don't tell me to
clench my butt cheeks

43:05.500 --> 43:07.179
over and over again.

43:07.180 --> 43:08.500
Well, I'd be honoured.

43:09.460 --> 43:12.500
Oh, I'm so happy, yay!

43:15.500 --> 43:17.179
Oh, God, I've upset her,
haven't I?

43:17.180 --> 43:18.539
I'll talk to her.

43:18.540 --> 43:20.219
I'm so glad you're doing it.

43:20.220 --> 43:22.939
Oh, me too, Dor.

43:22.940 --> 43:24.019
Just be careful there,
just down there.

43:24.020 --> 43:25.620
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:25.860 --> 43:30.220
Smith? You're wanted
in the Governor's office.

43:31.660 --> 43:33.700
Come in.

43:35.260 --> 43:36.739
Bea Smith for you, Governor.

43:36.740 --> 43:38.100
Sit down, Smith.

43:41.700 --> 43:44.420
This gentleman is a policeman.

43:45.620 --> 43:46.860
Hello.

43:50.860 --> 43:52.739
- Hey.
- Hey, Linda.

43:52.740 --> 43:54.339
Ferguson said to go
straight to her office

43:54.340 --> 43:55.500
as soon as you get here.

44:00.860 --> 44:02.700
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

44:07.340 --> 44:09.220
I don't know what
I can tell you.

44:14.340 --> 44:15.900
Governor, you wanted to see me?

44:16.820 --> 44:18.860
This gentleman does,
Mr. Jackson.

44:20.140 --> 44:21.899
- You're Will Jackson?
- Yes.

44:21.900 --> 44:24.380
Michael Mears, Homicide Squad.

44:25.300 --> 44:27.020
Can I talk to you outside?
