[woman laughs]

00:10.370 --> 00:12.361
Ha ha!

00:14.040 --> 00:15.599
People are staring.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.047
Well, let them stare.

00:18.110 --> 00:19.600
God, you're incredible.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.408
Dave.

00:21.780 --> 00:23.874
These last 6 months have
been the happiest of my life.

00:23.950 --> 00:25.679
Mine, too.

00:25.690 --> 00:28.011
You're the one, nicole.

00:37.900 --> 00:41.029
Nicole clark...

00:41.040 --> 00:43.134
Will you marry me?

00:43.200 --> 00:44.463
Yes.

00:44.540 --> 00:45.962
[cheering]

00:46.040 --> 00:48.634
Absolutely, yes.

00:48.710 --> 00:49.472
Ha ha!

00:50.710 --> 00:53.042
Oh, no. I guessed. I
wanted it to be a surprise.

00:53.050 --> 00:54.415
It's ok.
I love it.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.619
I'll have it resized
first thing tomorrow.

00:56.680 --> 00:59.411
You should probably
hold on to it.

00:59.490 --> 01:01.811
Ok.

01:08.260 --> 01:09.989
I love you so much.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.799
I love you, too.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.995
Dave: Oh, yeah.

01:42.060 --> 01:42.822
Ha ha ha!

01:42.900 --> 01:44.595
That's a good one.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.868
To stand out.

01:51.210 --> 01:54.669
You sure you don't
want to get that one?

02:01.220 --> 02:02.369
Thanks.

02:02.450 --> 02:03.178
Whoa!

02:03.190 --> 02:06.490
Hey! Watch where
you're going, pal!

02:06.550 --> 02:10.487
I need a--oh.
Oh, my god.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.289
He took the ring.

02:12.290 --> 02:14.179
Get the police.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.715
[recorded laughter]

02:39.790 --> 02:41.519
[spooky music playing]

02:41.590 --> 02:44.685
[recorded cackling]

02:52.130 --> 02:53.165
Ugh!

[recorded laughter]

03:36.210 --> 03:38.201
Ohh! Ugh!

03:59.900 --> 04:02.631
Janice: There are no recent
charges on perry's credit card,

04:02.700 --> 04:05.067
Nothing to indicate
where he and ray went.

04:05.070 --> 04:07.129
They're in los angeles.

04:07.210 --> 04:08.177
Are you sure?

04:08.240 --> 04:09.310
Yeah. I know ray.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.644
He's an obsessive
compulsive psychopath.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.849
Once he knew where I
was, he'd have to come.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.240
He couldn't
help himself.

04:15.250 --> 04:16.809
Then how do we
find him?

04:16.880 --> 04:19.349
We don't. He'll make
contact when he wants.

04:19.420 --> 04:21.786
And you're ok
with that.

04:21.860 --> 04:24.113
No, but I have to be.

04:24.190 --> 04:25.749
In the meantime,
I have a life.

04:25.760 --> 04:27.421
Jack: Santa monica pd
sent us a young couple,

04:27.430 --> 04:29.296
Possible stalking
incident on the pier

04:29.360 --> 04:30.020
This morning.

04:31.030 --> 04:31.792
They're in reception.
I can take it.

04:31.870 --> 04:33.099
Send them
to my office.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.829
No. We can do it.
Are you sure?

04:34.900 --> 04:38.962
It's ok.
I need to work.

04:40.410 --> 04:41.969
Beth: So what makes you
think this is more

04:42.040 --> 04:43.439
Than just a random
pick-pocketing?

04:43.450 --> 04:45.145
Because for the last
3 weeks there's been

04:45.210 --> 04:46.280
A red truck
following us--

04:46.280 --> 04:48.715
On dates, at home,
to the store.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.373
We thought we were
just being paranoid

04:50.450 --> 04:52.646
Until we saw the same
red truck today the pier.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.188
Did you get
a license plate number?

04:54.260 --> 04:55.785
No. I kept trying.
Couldn't make it out.

04:55.790 --> 04:56.882
It did have one
of those

04:56.960 --> 04:59.156
"keep honking, I'm
reloading" bumper stickers.

04:59.230 --> 05:01.358
Those aren't
that common.

05:01.430 --> 05:03.353
Ok. Let's say
this is stalking.

05:03.430 --> 05:04.966
Stealing the ring
indicates that someone's

05:04.970 --> 05:06.620
Not happy
about your engagement.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.859
Can you two think
of anyone would wouldn't

05:08.940 --> 05:10.192
Want you to be together?

05:10.270 --> 05:11.738
I mean, no.
We were--we were

05:11.810 --> 05:13.403
Both dating other
people when we met.

05:13.470 --> 05:16.576
Neither of our exes took
the breakup very well.

05:16.640 --> 05:17.471
In what way?

05:18.510 --> 05:19.739
I mean, my ex
stephanie, she kind of had

05:19.810 --> 05:21.517
A little bit
of a meltdown.

05:21.580 --> 05:22.809
I work at this
tech startup,

05:22.820 --> 05:26.347
And after I ended it, she
e-mailed all of my co-workers,

05:26.420 --> 05:27.546
Telling them what
a jerk I was.

05:27.620 --> 05:30.817
It was--it was
really embarrassing.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.480
Jack: And your ex?
How'd he react?

05:32.490 --> 05:33.685
He had a hard time
letting go.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.354
He was always very
possessive, controlling.

05:36.430 --> 05:39.491
If I even looked at another
guy, he'd get jealous.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.422
I met him once.

05:40.500 --> 05:44.164
I mean, he was
pretty intimidating.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.535
I mean, I wouldn't
mess with him.

05:45.610 --> 05:47.760
I know he's not happy
about dave and I dating.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.036
We're gonna need both
of their full names.

05:50.110 --> 05:53.080
Janice: Miss beekman, how
long did you an dave knox date?

05:53.150 --> 05:56.074
Dave and I were together
for 3 years.

05:56.150 --> 05:57.948
We talked
about getting married,

05:58.020 --> 05:58.942
Starting a family.

06:00.290 --> 06:01.109
So you must have been
pretty upset when he ended it.

06:01.190 --> 06:02.214
You could say that.

06:03.490 --> 06:04.457
I mean, one day, we're
making plans for our future,

06:04.460 --> 06:07.885
And the next day, he's telling
me that he met his soul mate.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.894
You sound skeptical.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.121
Just cynical.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.270
Nicole's a lifeguard.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.025
I've seen what
she looks like

06:14.040 --> 06:15.462
In a bathing suit.

06:15.540 --> 06:18.032
I'd probably choose her
over me, too.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.599
And that hasn't
made you bitter?

06:19.670 --> 06:22.640
No. I'm not bitter.

06:22.710 --> 06:24.303
I mean, maybe I was
6 months ago,

06:24.380 --> 06:25.745
But I got over it.

06:25.810 --> 06:27.744
That's not
what dave says.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.471
All right.
Yes, I wasn't happy.

06:30.550 --> 06:33.747
Yes, I might have expressed
it, but who wouldn't?

06:33.820 --> 06:37.154
And I'm not saying that
I don't regret what I did.

06:37.230 --> 06:37.981
He hurt me,

06:38.060 --> 06:38.959
But I got my revenge.

06:39.030 --> 06:40.623
I'm dating a new guy
who makes

06:40.700 --> 06:41.758
A lot more money
than dave.

06:43.060 --> 06:44.550
And you haven't been
following dave and nicole around

06:44.570 --> 06:45.469
In a red truck?

06:47.030 --> 06:48.737
Anyone who knows me knows I
wouldn't be caught dead in a truck.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.230
Total gas guzzler.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.801
I prefer to ride
my bike everywhere.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.075
Where were you
this morning

06:55.080 --> 06:56.605
Between 10:00
and noon?

06:56.680 --> 06:58.569
Asleep in bed.

06:58.580 --> 06:59.445
I'm a night owl.

06:59.510 --> 07:01.239
Can anyone
confirm that?

07:01.250 --> 07:04.117
Your new boyfriend
perhaps?

07:04.190 --> 07:06.147
I was alone.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.518
Look. I know that
you don't believe me,

07:08.590 --> 07:12.356
But if dave wants to
spend the rest of his life

07:12.430 --> 07:14.580
Getting skin cancer
with little miss "baywatch,”

07:14.600 --> 07:15.999
Then I'm happy for him.

07:16.060 --> 07:18.995
I'm just glad that I
found out how shallow he was

07:19.070 --> 07:22.040
Before I made
a lifelong commitment.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.693
Beth: Mr. Harris, where
did you meet nicole clark?

07:23.770 --> 07:26.762
We work together, _santa
monica's lifeguard division.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.305
I am a beach captain,

07:28.380 --> 07:30.030
She's a ocean
lifeguard specialist.

07:30.110 --> 07:31.134
You're her supervisor?

07:31.210 --> 07:33.144
I cover nicole's beach,
check in with her

07:33.210 --> 07:34.143
Throughout the day.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.211
You never requested
reassignment?

07:36.280 --> 07:36.974
Why would I?

07:37.920 --> 07:38.489
After she dumped you,
weren't things

07:38.550 --> 07:39.540
A little awkward,

07:39.620 --> 07:40.644
Seeing her every day
at work,

07:40.720 --> 07:41.949
Knowing she's
with someone else?

07:41.960 --> 07:43.610
It was hard
at first,

07:43.630 --> 07:44.779
But it got easier.

07:44.790 --> 07:46.554
I try not to let it
get in the way

07:46.630 --> 07:47.529
Of our work
relationship.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.489
Beth: But you still
love her.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.119
Yeah, I guess.

07:51.130 --> 07:53.394
You don't just stop
loving someone.

07:53.470 --> 07:55.336
How do you feel about nicole
and dave getting married?

07:55.400 --> 07:58.461
I didn't know about the
engagement until you told me.

07:58.470 --> 08:01.007
I'm happy for her if
that's what she wants.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.037
So you're not
the least bit jealous?

08:03.110 --> 08:04.578
I'm not
the jealous type.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.049
That's not what
she told us.

08:06.110 --> 08:10.672
She said that you were
possessive and controlling.

08:10.750 --> 08:11.911
She did?

08:11.990 --> 08:12.912
Mm-hmm.

08:12.990 --> 08:14.583
Well, maybe I came off
that way,

08:14.660 --> 08:16.014
But I didn't mean to.

08:16.090 --> 08:17.319
I just really
cared for her.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.022
Then you must have been pretty
angry when dave stole her from you.

08:20.090 --> 08:22.400
Is it the way I wanted
things to turn out?

08:22.460 --> 08:23.530
Of course not,

08:23.600 --> 08:24.658
But dave's a good guy,

08:25.970 --> 08:27.597
And nicole deserves someone
who would be good to her.

08:27.670 --> 08:30.992
That's awfully
forgiving of you.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.900
I just want nicole
to be happy.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.038
Where were you
this morning?

08:35.110 --> 08:37.169
North headquarters,
filling out paperwork.

08:37.179 --> 08:38.578
A dozen people saw me.

08:38.650 --> 08:41.676
I can get you
their names.

08:45.490 --> 08:48.209
Jack, you got a minute?

08:48.290 --> 08:51.260
Sure.
What's up?

08:51.330 --> 08:52.252
Is ethan ok?

08:52.330 --> 08:53.582
Yeah, ethan's great.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.549
He really loved
Saturday.

08:55.630 --> 08:56.859
The movie was
a big hit.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.053
It wasn't that good.

08:58.130 --> 08:59.620
He said
the same thing,

08:59.700 --> 09:01.532
But spending time
with you...

09:01.540 --> 09:04.589
Thanks for letting
it happen.

09:04.670 --> 09:05.933
Dinner Friday?

09:06.010 --> 09:07.967
Ethan's gonna have
some friends

09:08.040 --> 09:08.905
And pizza and games,

09:08.980 --> 09:10.607
And he'd like to
introduce you

09:10.680 --> 09:13.240
If you're up
for it.

09:13.310 --> 09:14.971
Are you up for it?

09:15.050 --> 09:17.109
I'm cautiously
optimistic.

09:17.180 --> 09:18.488
Then I'm there.

09:18.550 --> 09:20.814
Ok. I'll let
him know.

09:20.890 --> 09:22.085
Thank you.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.412
Beth: I don't know
if I buy it.

09:23.490 --> 09:24.560
It's got to kill him
to see her every day

09:24.560 --> 09:26.050
And know she loves
someone else.

09:26.060 --> 09:27.050
His alibi checks out.

09:28.260 --> 09:28.658
He was at the lifeguard
headquarters all morning.

09:29.760 --> 09:29.999
Stephanie on the
other hand has no alibi,

09:31.330 --> 09:31.728
And she certainly didn't
hide her dislike of nicole.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.093
But she's not clinging to the
past the way a stalker would.

09:35.170 --> 09:36.638
She's moving on
with her life.

09:36.700 --> 09:37.496
Eh, so she says.

09:37.570 --> 09:38.731
What if it's
neither of them?

09:38.740 --> 09:40.162
Dave works in tech,
startup.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.310
That's pretty competitive.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.632
Nicole's a lifeguard.
Could make her

09:42.710 --> 09:44.576
The target of all sorts
of unwanted attention.

09:44.580 --> 09:48.141
Let's take a look into their
professional lives, see what we can find.

09:48.220 --> 09:51.474
[music playing]

09:51.550 --> 09:52.642
Man: Ha ha ha!

09:52.720 --> 09:56.509
I can't believe you
lost the ring, bro.

09:56.590 --> 09:57.318
Smooth move.

09:57.390 --> 09:59.256
I didn't lose
the ring, ok?

09:59.260 --> 10:01.695
Nicole, you sure you want
to marry this schmuck?

10:01.760 --> 10:04.650
Positive. Heh heh.

10:04.730 --> 10:05.925
Ooh! I'm so excited.

10:05.930 --> 10:07.125
We're gonna have
a wedding!

10:07.200 --> 10:08.599
Is it too early
to stress?

10:08.600 --> 10:12.503
Never. Burgers
and hot dogs coming up.

10:12.570 --> 10:13.765
Hey. This is
the last beer,

10:13.780 --> 10:15.600
So someone's got to
make a run.

10:15.610 --> 10:17.874
Pete. You did
drink most of it.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.600
Oh, yeah. Make
the drunk guy drive.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.770
Dave: I'll go.
It's always me anyway.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.612
Thanks, honey.

10:24.490 --> 10:27.050
"Thanks, honey."
you're so whipped.

10:27.120 --> 10:31.182
That attitude is why you'll
be single for life, pete.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.049
What?

10:59.650 --> 11:01.414
Hello?

11:02.520 --> 11:04.659
Who's that?

11:04.660 --> 11:06.879
Pete, is that you?

11:08.830 --> 11:12.425
Hey. What are
you doing?

11:14.470 --> 11:16.734
No! No!

11:16.800 --> 11:18.666
Aah! Aah! No!

11:18.670 --> 11:21.776
[screaming]

11:23.940 --> 11:25.339
Ha ha ha!

11:25.350 --> 11:27.876
[dave screaming]

11:27.950 --> 11:29.839
Man: Is somebody
screaming?

11:29.850 --> 11:31.682
Dave?

11:31.690 --> 11:34.887
Man: Come on, guys.

11:40.290 --> 11:42.600
Oh, my god! Dave!

11:42.660 --> 11:44.253
[screaming]

11:44.330 --> 11:47.789
Help! Help! Help!

11:47.870 --> 11:51.192
No! Dave! Dave!

11:56.980 --> 11:59.278
[indistinct chatter]

11:59.350 --> 12:01.102
What brings you fellas
out here?

12:01.180 --> 12:02.318
Our case.
Dave knox.

12:02.380 --> 12:03.973
As a half-hour ago,
it became my case.

12:04.050 --> 12:06.940
Dave knox didn't make it
through the night.

12:07.020 --> 12:07.987
Any eyewitnesses?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.653
Jack, this is
robbery homicide's show now,

12:09.720 --> 12:10.949
So why don't you tell me
what you know?

12:11.030 --> 12:12.657
The case originated
with tau.

12:12.730 --> 12:14.220
We're gonna run lead.

12:14.230 --> 12:15.550
Is this like
a power play?

12:15.560 --> 12:16.755
Not a power play.
We're invested,

12:16.830 --> 12:18.559
And we'd like to see
it through, that's all.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.322
Of course, jack.
It's all yours.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.097
Your witnesses
are right over there.

12:25.370 --> 12:28.010
I'll talk
to the withesses.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.434
I want to thank you.

12:29.510 --> 12:29.999
For what?

12:30.880 --> 12:31.779
Amanda told me you
played a part

12:31.850 --> 12:33.602
In me seeing my son.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.569
I grew up
without a father, jack.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.810
Anything I said to amanda
really didn't have

12:37.890 --> 12:39.483
Anything to do
with you.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.143
It was about ethan.

12:41.220 --> 12:42.813
I know I've been
around lately.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.312
Not every guy would
be cool with that,

12:44.390 --> 12:47.951
So thanks
for understanding.

12:48.030 --> 12:50.658
You gonna be there
Friday night?

12:50.730 --> 12:52.664
Friday?

12:55.040 --> 12:58.931
Crime scene's this way.
I'll walk you over. Come on.

13:00.140 --> 13:01.778
Ben: Did you guys see
anything weird,

13:01.780 --> 13:03.635
Anyone at the party who
shouldn't have been there?

13:03.710 --> 13:05.474
People were
coming and going.

13:05.550 --> 13:06.608
I-I don't know.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.849
I was pretty wasted.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.115
I couldn't keep track of
where everybody was.

13:09.120 --> 13:11.714
Did nicole or dave have any
enemies that you knew of?

13:11.790 --> 13:12.882
Dave's a great guy.

13:12.950 --> 13:14.987
They're both
good people.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.812
They're the couple
everyone wants to be.

13:16.890 --> 13:20.679
I can't think of anyone
would do something this awful.

13:20.760 --> 13:21.989
I can't believe it.

13:22.060 --> 13:23.789
It doesn't seem real.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.620
They were so happy.

13:25.630 --> 13:29.794
Trent: S.I.D. Found traces
of an accelerant in the tunnel.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.960
Evidence points
to the ignition source being

13:31.970 --> 13:34.803
Some kind
of zippo-style lighter.

13:34.810 --> 13:35.732
You find the lighter?

13:37.080 --> 13:39.139
No. The intent here
wasn't just to kill the victim.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.879
They wanted him
to suffer.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.874
You thinking a jealous
ex or something?

13:43.950 --> 13:46.840
It's personal,
definitely revenge.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.319
I'm not sure
about the ex.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.856
Well, I'll let you know
if anything comes back

13:49.920 --> 13:51.854
From forensics
on the accelerant.

13:51.930 --> 13:53.659
Thanks, trent.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.869
Beth: What did you find out about
nicole and dave's professional life?

13:58.930 --> 14:00.523
No workplace drama
on dave's side.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.999
It's just like
their friends said.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.991
He was well-liked
by everyone.

14:04.010 --> 14:04.932
And nicole?

14:06.040 --> 14:06.199
In her 5 years with
the lifeguard division,

14:06.970 --> 14:07.710
She had
an exemplary record,

14:07.780 --> 14:09.179
That is
until 3 months ago.

14:09.180 --> 14:12.605
A 12-year-old boy pedro
vasquez drowned on her watch.

14:12.680 --> 14:15.240
The boy's parents
brought suit against the city.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.173
What was their claim?

14:17.280 --> 14:18.076
Criminal negligence.
They felt nicole didn't

14:18.150 --> 14:18.912
Do enough to save
their son.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.911
They were asking for
a million in damages.

14:20.990 --> 14:21.741
Did they get it?

14:22.820 --> 14:23.810
No. The judge ruled
in favor of the city.

14:23.830 --> 14:24.388
Nicole was cleared
of any wrong-doing.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.025
That's not the outcome
they were hoping for.

14:26.990 --> 14:27.559
After the ruling,
the boy's father was

14:27.560 --> 14:28.789
Quoted in the press
as saying,

14:28.800 --> 14:30.256
"that lifeguard
deserves to suffer

14:30.330 --> 14:32.765
The same way
we have suffered."

14:32.830 --> 14:33.763
He lost his son,

14:33.830 --> 14:35.537
So he takes someone
nicole loves.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.463
Eye for an eye.

14:39.140 --> 14:42.201
Nicole: He gave me
this on our second date.

14:42.210 --> 14:44.099
We went
to the aquarium.

14:44.180 --> 14:48.572
He carried on a whole
conversation with a dolphin.

14:48.650 --> 14:50.573
He was always
so goofy.

14:50.650 --> 14:52.414
That's what
I loved about him.

14:52.490 --> 14:58.315
His, uh--his parents are
flying out from michigan.

14:58.390 --> 15:01.655
They don't even know
about the engagement yet.

15:01.730 --> 15:04.119
Janice: We know this is
a difficult time, nicole,

15:04.200 --> 15:09.070
But we need to ask you
about pedro vasquez.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.492
Pedro?

15:10.570 --> 15:12.664
What does he have
to do with any of this?

15:12.740 --> 15:16.108
Beth: We understand his
parents blamed you for his death.

15:16.180 --> 15:17.739
That wasn't
my fault.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.946
Can you tell us
what happened that day?

15:20.010 --> 15:21.444
Pedro was playing
with his friends.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.171
It was October,
our off season.

15:24.250 --> 15:26.287
There were only
100 guards working

15:26.350 --> 15:27.511
A whole 40-mile coastline.

15:27.590 --> 15:29.957
That meant that some towers
were left empty.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.954
There must have been
signs warning people

15:32.030 --> 15:33.156
<i>- Not to swim
in those areas.</i>

15:33.230 --> 15:34.482
Pedro and his friends
ignored the signs,

15:34.560 --> 15:38.963
And there were no parents
around to stop them.

15:39.030 --> 15:39.929
Where were
his parents?

15:39.940 --> 15:41.522
<i>I don't know.
Al I know is</i>

15:41.600 --> 15:43.489
That pedro got pulled
into a rip current,

15:43.570 --> 15:50.033
Um, and by the time that one
of his friends got to my tower,

15:50.110 --> 15:51.999
It was already
too late.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.344
You told his parents
all of this?

15:54.420 --> 15:57.811
What, you don't think that they
have anything to do with this?

15:57.890 --> 15:59.949
It's something
we're exploring.

15:59.960 --> 16:06.150
My supervisors told me that the
lawsuit was just a financial grab.

16:06.230 --> 16:10.519
Are they capable of doing
something so horrible?

16:11.330 --> 16:13.128
Man: No way my boy
went swimming

16:13.130 --> 16:14.564
In an area
without a lifeguard.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.630
He knew better
than that.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.892
Are you saying
nicole lied?

16:16.970 --> 16:19.462
I don't blame her for
covering her own ass.

16:19.470 --> 16:21.666
I blame the judge
for not seeing through it.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.299
The system's rigged
to favor

16:23.310 --> 16:24.402
The pretty white girl.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.641
I know the score.

16:25.650 --> 16:27.140
I've seen it
too many times.

16:27.150 --> 16:27.969
Yeah, I get it juan.

16:27.980 --> 16:29.243
System failed
to deliver justice,

16:29.320 --> 16:31.015
So you took justice
into your own hands.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.683
I had nothing to do
with what happened

16:32.750 --> 16:35.048
To that lady's fiancee.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.155
<i>We don't wish that
on anyone.</i>

16:36.160 --> 16:37.184
Jack: But you did, juan.

16:37.260 --> 16:39.228
You told the press
she deserved to suffer.

16:39.290 --> 16:40.155
I was grieving.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.729
I would have said anything
if it'd make me feel better.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.655
Where are you
last night?

16:44.670 --> 16:45.398
Home.

16:45.470 --> 16:46.699
Can your wife
confirm it?

16:46.770 --> 16:48.192
Me and isabella,

16:48.270 --> 16:50.568
We're not together
anymore.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.062
After pedro,

16:52.140 --> 16:53.505
Things were never
good between us.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.160
I ran background
on you, juan.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.275
You have a record,
3 years in chino for arson.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.706
I made a stupid mistake
when I was a kid.

17:01.780 --> 17:03.009
I served my time.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.112
Makes me wonder, though.

17:04.180 --> 17:06.114
See, our victim was
lit on fire.

17:06.190 --> 17:07.281
You have a thing
for a fire.

17:07.349 --> 17:09.579
I am not
that person anymore.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.059
Having a kid
changed me.

17:11.130 --> 17:15.021
Maybe losing him.
Changed you back.

17:15.030 --> 17:16.555
If you're gonna
arrest me,

17:16.630 --> 17:17.425
Then arrest me,

17:18.500 --> 17:19.922
But don't come into
my place of business

17:20.000 --> 17:22.037
And make accusations
you can't back up.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.439
Thank you for your time,
mr. Vasquez.

17:23.500 --> 17:27.209
We'll be in touch if we
have any more questions.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.209
What was that?
I had him.

17:33.210 --> 17:34.280
We don't know
he's our guy.

17:34.350 --> 17:36.819
He has motive, means,
and no alibi to speak of.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.986
We have nothing concrete
liking him to the crime scene.

17:40.050 --> 17:43.213
It won't be enough
for the d.A.

17:43.220 --> 17:44.710
Fine. I'll put
a unit on him.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.222
We'll wait for him
to slip up.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.892
Nicole: Hey.
I'm just at my tower,

17:51.900 --> 17:53.163
Packing up my things.

17:53.230 --> 17:57.167
I'll be back at the house
in about half an hour.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.733
Thanks, zo.
You're the best.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.666
[grunt]

18:33.310 --> 18:35.267
Hello?

18:39.110 --> 18:39.702
Hey.

18:40.650 --> 18:42.175
Ohh! Mike, what
are you doing here?

18:42.250 --> 18:43.945
I know you're
taking some time off.

18:43.950 --> 18:48.547
I thought you might need
some help packing up.

18:48.620 --> 18:49.189
You ok?

18:50.160 --> 18:52.185
Did you hear something
under the pier?

18:52.260 --> 18:52.829
No.

18:53.830 --> 18:55.286
I thought I-I heard
someone calling out.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.153
I should check it out.

18:56.230 --> 18:59.325
No, no, no. You
sit tight. I'll go.

19:06.940 --> 19:09.329
Mike: Unh!

19:09.410 --> 19:11.208
Mike?

19:11.280 --> 19:15.148
Is everything ok?

19:15.150 --> 19:16.743
Mike?

19:22.360 --> 19:24.055
Mike?

19:34.670 --> 19:36.229
Mike?

19:43.880 --> 19:47.043
Mike! Mike!

19:49.220 --> 19:51.109
Help!

19:52.850 --> 19:56.252
Help! Help!

19:57.720 --> 20:00.621
[coughing]

20:03.200 --> 20:06.295
Help! Help!

20:12.310 --> 20:13.402
Nicole, whoever did this

20:13.470 --> 20:14.301
Came here looking
for you.

20:14.310 --> 20:15.607
They first came
to your lifeguard tower,

20:15.610 --> 20:17.100
And then they followed
you to the pier,

20:17.110 --> 20:18.600
Where they knew you'd
be vulnerable.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.205
Mike just got
in the way.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.949
Do you remember anything
about the attack?

20:22.020 --> 20:26.241
Nothing, not until I was
pulling him out of the water.

20:26.320 --> 20:27.481
Mike: I didn't see
the attacker.

20:27.550 --> 20:28.881
They must have come up
behind me

20:28.890 --> 20:30.585
And hit me
with something.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.321
Can you identify
the weapon?

20:32.390 --> 20:35.428
No. Maybe a piece
of driftwood.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.899
They wash up
all the time.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.119
Just wondering why the
injury to the front of your head

20:39.200 --> 20:41.726
When you were hit
from behind.

20:41.740 --> 20:46.166
Are you accusing me
of something.

20:46.240 --> 20:50.108
No. I'm just asking.

20:50.180 --> 20:52.103
I heard a noise
behind me,

20:52.180 --> 20:55.275
I turn around,
and whack.

20:57.020 --> 20:59.341
Why were you
out here at all?

20:59.420 --> 21:02.117
I wanted nicole to know
I'm here for her

21:02.190 --> 21:04.409
If she needs me.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.486
Is that
a security camera?

21:08.560 --> 21:11.450
No. It's a weather camera
for the surfers

21:11.530 --> 21:14.261
To check the a.M. Break
on the city web site.

21:14.270 --> 21:16.090
<i>2417
Yes.</i>

21:17.370 --> 21:20.010
I don't know. I'm not in
charge of the weather cameras.

21:20.070 --> 21:20.969
Who is?

21:21.040 --> 21:24.476
The city, I guess.

21:24.540 --> 21:25.530
Janice: Got anything?

21:26.910 --> 21:28.173
I had to search through
hours of footage to find this.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.479
I've zoomed in.

21:30.420 --> 21:31.979
The description dave
and nicole gave?

21:32.050 --> 21:33.347
Same bumper sticker.

21:33.420 --> 21:34.842
It arrives an hour
before the attack

21:34.920 --> 21:36.319
And leaves
two hours later.

21:36.390 --> 21:37.949
Can you see
who's driving?

21:37.960 --> 21:39.519
It's the wrong angle.
You can't really see

21:39.590 --> 21:41.558
Anyone entering
or exiting the vehicle.

21:41.630 --> 21:44.122
Zoom in
on the license plate.

21:44.130 --> 21:46.326
[typing]

21:46.500 --> 21:49.959
Truck is registered
to isabella vasquez.

21:49.970 --> 21:52.905
That's juan vasquez's
ex-wife.,

21:54.270 --> 21:56.637
You think I attacked
those people?

21:56.640 --> 22:00.042
I've never hurt
anyone in my life.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.317
Your truck,
your license plate,

22:02.320 --> 22:03.845
Nicole clark's beach.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.570
It's not looking good,
mrs. Vasquez.

22:05.650 --> 22:07.209
That's employee
parking by the pier.

22:07.290 --> 22:10.214
I work as a manager
at one of the gift shops.

22:10.290 --> 22:11.382
So you were working
at the time?

22:11.460 --> 22:12.586
That's right.

22:12.660 --> 22:13.582
We spoke to your shop.

22:13.660 --> 22:15.253
They said you took
the day off yesterday.

22:15.330 --> 22:16.923
According to the owner,
you've been calling in

22:17.000 --> 22:17.899
Sick a lot lately.

22:19.030 --> 22:19.861
We know you've been
following nicole and dave.

22:19.870 --> 22:22.589
Would you care to
change your statement?

22:25.010 --> 22:30.403
Sometimes, I sit
in my truck

22:30.480 --> 22:31.402
And stare at her

22:31.480 --> 22:33.778
In her
lifeguard tower.

22:33.850 --> 22:35.773
I didn't hurt
anyone.

22:35.850 --> 22:36.612
I just watched.

22:37.650 --> 22:39.049
You followed her home
and other places.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.839
I wanted to see her
and her life.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.012
I had to know
if she was happy.

22:45.030 --> 22:48.182
She doesn't deserve
to be.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.292
Is that all?

22:49.360 --> 22:51.522
No. I want proof

22:51.530 --> 22:53.897
That she's not
good at her job.

22:53.970 --> 22:57.691
They told me pedro's
death was an accident,

22:57.710 --> 23:00.805
But I know that girl
wasn't watching.

23:00.870 --> 23:02.736
She wasn't
paying attention,

23:02.810 --> 23:04.209
And my son died.

23:04.210 --> 23:08.602
Nicole told us that pedro
was with his friends that day.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.546
Pedro came to work
with me.

23:10.550 --> 23:14.088
We couldn't always
afford after-school care.

23:14.150 --> 23:15.879
I told him to go
play with his friends

23:15.890 --> 23:17.153
While I worked.

23:17.220 --> 23:20.429
I told him to stay by
the lifeguard tower.

23:20.490 --> 23:21.889
He was a good boy.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.291
He always listened
to me.

23:25.370 --> 23:26.428
It's completely
understandable

23:26.500 --> 23:29.299
That you'd want to blame
someone for what happened.

23:29.370 --> 23:30.963
It was her fault.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.509
I know it was.

23:33.570 --> 23:35.459
Pedro was
a good boy.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.975
It shouldn't have
happened to him.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.599
Trent: That's almost
a confession.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.341
She blames nicole,
and this is how she's

23:41.420 --> 23:42.444
Gonna make the girl suffer.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.669
Sounds more like
she's projecting

23:43.750 --> 23:45.673
Her own guilt
onto nicole.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.582
That woman ultimately
blames herself.

23:47.590 --> 23:48.614
You saw that.

23:48.690 --> 23:49.760
I saw a woman
that was angry,

23:49.760 --> 23:51.285
Who we can place
at the scene of the crime.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.988
Motive, opportunity.
We can charge her.

23:54.060 --> 23:55.289
It won't stick, trent.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.691
Charge her,
and I'll build a case.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.751
I'm sorry, trent. I got to
go with jack on this one.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.023
- This is all
circumstantial.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.124
Seriously?

24:02.200 --> 24:04.134
I can support a search
warrant on her house.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.259
Write it up, and
we can file it today.

24:06.270 --> 24:07.305
I can't believe this.

24:07.370 --> 24:08.804
We'll write the warrant,
we'll search the house

24:08.880 --> 24:12.441
And see if we can come up
with something more concrete.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.712
No short cuts
on this one.

24:16.780 --> 24:19.886
Find me some
real evidence.

24:27.630 --> 24:28.552
What was that about?

24:28.630 --> 24:30.120
You think I'm wrong
about the case?

24:30.130 --> 24:31.200
I didn't say that.

24:31.260 --> 24:32.466
You should have had
my back in there.

24:32.470 --> 24:34.859
I do have your back. You're
rushing an investigation.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.135
What is wrong?

24:36.140 --> 24:37.995
Nothing.

24:40.070 --> 24:43.700
I know you, trent.
This is about jack.

24:44.580 --> 24:47.242
What's going on
Friday night?

24:48.580 --> 24:52.483
Ethan is having friends
over to meet jack.

24:52.490 --> 24:53.912
How did you know?

24:53.990 --> 24:55.014
Jack invited me.

24:55.090 --> 24:57.058
Well, great. I was
gonna tell you.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.680
We had plans
Friday night.

25:01.530 --> 25:05.592
I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.

25:10.540 --> 25:13.532
[music playing on tv.]

25:13.970 --> 25:18.510
So should we try not
watching something else?

25:18.510 --> 25:21.070
I'm sorry.
I'm just so scattered.

25:21.150 --> 25:26.589
It's ok. You're
allowed to be.

25:26.650 --> 25:27.947
It's late.

25:28.020 --> 25:33.550
I should probably try
not sleeping for a while.

25:33.630 --> 25:38.522
Ok. I'll just chill
here on my couch fort.

25:38.530 --> 25:41.397
I appreciate
the company, zo.

25:43.070 --> 25:44.731
Come here.

25:45.640 --> 25:49.873
We'll get
through this, ok?

25:49.880 --> 25:51.700
We're all ok here?

25:51.710 --> 25:55.248
Yeah. Don't worry
about me.

26:23.180 --> 26:26.605
[water running]

26:27.080 --> 26:29.412
[water stops]

26:31.720 --> 26:33.142
[spits]

26:33.220 --> 26:36.520
[water running]

26:55.980 --> 26:57.869
[thud]

27:24.640 --> 27:27.564
Voice: Nicole.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.062
Zoe!

27:30.140 --> 27:33.849
Zoe! Zoe!

27:33.910 --> 27:35.844
Aah! Aah!

27:35.920 --> 27:39.743
There's somebody in
my bedroom. Call 911.

27:50.830 --> 27:52.719
Beth: There's a pillow
and a blanket

27:52.800 --> 27:54.723
And a bunch
of fast food wrappers.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.029
They cut a hole in the floor
and the cabinet.

27:56.040 --> 28:00.500
Someone's been living in the
crawlspace under the house? Creepy.

28:00.510 --> 28:02.672
This doesn't seem like
revenge stalking.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.772
This person wanted to be
close to nicole,

28:03.780 --> 28:06.545
Watch her shower, see
her naked, that kind of thing.

28:06.610 --> 28:08.840
Yeah. Implies
a romantic obsession.

28:08.850 --> 28:10.340
Have s.I.D. Collect
everything,

28:10.350 --> 28:12.216
Get it back to forensics
for testing.

28:12.290 --> 28:13.746
Will do.

28:13.820 --> 28:16.517
Nicole: Someone was
under my house, watching me?

28:16.520 --> 28:17.510
For how long?

28:18.860 --> 28:19.930
It looks like they've been
there a while, weeks maybe.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.719
That is seriously
messed up.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.952
Did either of you see anything
that could help us identify anyone?

28:25.030 --> 28:27.260
No. I heard someone call
my name, and I took off.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.731
I wasn't about to stick
around and see who it was.

28:29.800 --> 28:30.562
What about you, zoe?

28:30.640 --> 28:32.130
No. I was
in the living room,

28:32.210 --> 28:33.905
And I heard
nicole scream,

28:33.970 --> 28:35.369
And the next thing
I knew, she's

28:35.380 --> 28:36.302
Coming down
the hallway,

28:36.380 --> 28:37.802
And then we just got
outside and waited

28:37.880 --> 28:38.699
For the police.

28:39.750 --> 28:40.478
All right. It's unlikely
they'll come back,

28:41.510 --> 28:42.204
But I'm gonna put
a unit outside anyway.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.712
I can't stay here,
not after what happened.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.085
I don't feel safe.

28:46.150 --> 28:48.881
Do you have some place
you can go?

28:49.220 --> 28:52.053
You can stay with me
as long as you need.

28:52.060 --> 28:53.789
I don't want to put
you in danger, zo.

28:53.860 --> 28:55.453
No, no. It's ok.

28:55.530 --> 28:57.294
You'll put police
outside, right?

28:57.360 --> 28:59.465
I can arrange that,
yeah.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.066
Janice: Beth.

29:01.070 --> 29:02.731
Excuse me.

29:04.900 --> 29:08.131
S.I.D. Found this
in the crawlspace.

29:09.510 --> 29:10.636
M.H.?

29:10.710 --> 29:14.499
Mike harris,
nicole's ex.

29:14.580 --> 29:16.275
[snap]

29:20.550 --> 29:21.847
Gotcha, mike.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.809
You used that
to set the fire

29:23.890 --> 29:25.255
That killed
dave knox.

29:25.260 --> 29:27.251
There's been
a big mistake.

29:27.260 --> 29:28.182
I didn't kill anyone.

29:28.260 --> 29:29.591
It's got your
initials on it.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.989
We found it in your little
love nest under nicole's house.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.959
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:35.240 --> 29:38.437
It was a gift from my dad,
but I quit smoking years ago.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.760
Oh. So you found
a new use for it.

29:39.770 --> 29:41.932
No. I keep it
in my desk

29:41.940 --> 29:43.305
At the headquarters.

29:43.380 --> 29:44.779
Somebody must have
stolen it.

29:44.780 --> 29:45.770
I'm being set up.

29:45.780 --> 29:47.373
Why would I leave
the lighter there?

29:47.450 --> 29:48.645
It makes no sense.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.710
That's what
happens, mike.

29:49.780 --> 29:51.179
<i>People slip up
in a moment.</i>

29:51.250 --> 29:53.890
Killing somebody
takes a toll.

29:53.950 --> 29:56.851
You panic,
you make mistakes.

29:56.920 --> 29:57.990
But why would I do it?

29:58.060 --> 30:01.360
Dave was a good guy,
nicole loved him.

30:01.430 --> 30:04.650
Look. My job is
to save people.

30:04.730 --> 30:06.994
I could never take
somebody's life.

30:07.070 --> 30:08.492
You were jealous
of dave.

30:08.570 --> 30:09.867
He stole your girl,
so you killed him,

30:09.940 --> 30:11.692
And then you faked that
little attack under the pier

30:11.770 --> 30:13.169
To get nicole's
sympathy.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.332
You're wrong.

30:14.410 --> 30:15.309
And now you are looking

30:15.310 --> 30:17.677
At a first-degree
murder charge.

30:17.740 --> 30:19.208
I want a lawyer.

30:19.280 --> 30:20.975
Yeah.

30:21.850 --> 30:24.911
That--that sounds
like a good idea.

30:32.630 --> 30:33.984
He's right.

30:33.990 --> 30:34.980
The lighter is
too obvious.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.253
It's called
evidence, jack.

30:37.330 --> 30:38.820
We found it,
we got him.

30:38.830 --> 30:40.229
But we didn't find it.

30:40.300 --> 30:41.392
We were led to it.

30:41.470 --> 30:42.892
Why would he attack
nicole in her house now?

30:42.970 --> 30:45.996
There were plenty of opportunities
when she was alone, unprotected.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.069
Why risk it? Because
they knew we'd find

30:48.140 --> 30:50.108
The crawlspace
and the lighter.

30:50.180 --> 30:51.773
This was planned
and calculated.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.774
You are giving this killer
way too much credit, jack.

30:54.850 --> 30:56.841
Come on. I thought you
were a homicide detective

30:56.850 --> 30:58.409
In a previous life.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.618
What's going on?

30:59.690 --> 31:02.716
I thought we were
working well together.

31:02.790 --> 31:05.953
Yeah? Well, everyone
has a threshold.

31:11.030 --> 31:12.896
Janice: Forensics
sent over the items

31:12.970 --> 31:13.926
Pulled from
the crawlspace.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.092
No useable prints
or dna.

31:15.170 --> 31:17.593
Janice: It's mostly trash,
but there are photos

31:17.670 --> 31:18.899
Of nicole in her
lifeguard uniform

31:18.970 --> 31:21.610
And newspaper clippings
about her rescues.

31:21.670 --> 31:24.901
"Santa monica lifeguard
saves drowning children,”

31:24.980 --> 31:26.243
"lifeguard rescues
drowning man

31:26.310 --> 31:27.709
From dangerous riptide."

31:27.720 --> 31:28.778
Looks like
hero worship.

31:28.850 --> 31:30.318
And we're attracted
to heroes because

31:30.380 --> 31:31.609
We see them as
the embodiment

31:31.680 --> 31:34.388
Of our undeveloped
potential.

31:34.390 --> 31:35.539
Freud called it
the ego ideal.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.483
So more than likely,
we're looking for someone

31:37.560 --> 31:38.482
With low
self-esteem.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.959
Mike doesn't fit
the profile.

31:40.030 --> 31:41.725
He's confident. I mean,
he's a hero himself.

31:41.730 --> 31:44.927
No. This is someone
who's seen nicole on the job.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.729
They may have even been
rescued by her.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.129
All right. Contact
lifeguard headquarters.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.760
Let's get a record of
everyone nicole's ever saved.

31:50.840 --> 31:51.659
Wait. I have it.

31:51.740 --> 31:53.401
My contact at the
lifeguard division

31:53.410 --> 31:55.469
Gave me access to
their secure database.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.269
They keep a record
of every rescue.

31:57.340 --> 31:58.501
<i>There's
a medical component.</i>

31:58.580 --> 32:00.469
It'll even have the
victim's name and address.

32:00.550 --> 32:03.076
How many rescues has
nicole been a part of?

32:03.080 --> 32:05.947
Janice: Uh, in the last
5 years...

32:06.020 --> 32:07.317
63 with
a medical component.

32:07.390 --> 32:09.984
Janice, back up.

32:10.060 --> 32:11.312
Back, back.

32:11.390 --> 32:12.357
What is it?

32:12.430 --> 32:13.249
Zoe parsons.

32:13.260 --> 32:14.750
Nicole's best friend.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.524
According to this,
nicole saved zoe

32:16.600 --> 32:18.955
After she jumped off
the santa monica pier.

32:19.030 --> 32:19.861
Could she be?

32:20.770 --> 32:20.963
She was at the party
at the beach.

32:21.730 --> 32:22.299
She had access
to the tunnel.

32:23.870 --> 32:24.268
Yeah, but she was in the living
room during last night's attack.

32:25.240 --> 32:25.593
- How could she be
in two places at once?

32:26.740 --> 32:27.969
The distance from the
bathroom to the bedroom

32:28.040 --> 32:30.805
Is shorter from the
outside than from the inside.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.370
Wait. Did she have
enough time?

32:32.450 --> 32:33.645
Yeah. She scares
nicole here

32:33.710 --> 32:34.848
And has plenty of time
to crawl out

32:34.910 --> 32:36.810
From under the house
and into the living room.

32:36.880 --> 32:38.018
Where nicole found her

32:38.080 --> 32:39.172
Like she'd been there
the whole time.

32:39.250 --> 32:40.809
She had it all planned.
She was leading us

32:40.890 --> 32:42.483
To mike harris' lighter.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.686
_Nicole's
with zoe now.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.558
Alert the unit outside
of zoe's house.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.450
Send backup.

32:47.460 --> 32:49.656
Thanks for taking
me out, zo.

32:49.730 --> 32:52.119
I needed some
fresh air.

32:52.130 --> 32:55.998
Now's no time to be
cooped up all alone.

32:56.970 --> 32:58.665
When's your family
coming to town?

32:58.740 --> 33:00.902
Um, my mom flew out
this morning,

33:00.970 --> 33:02.972
And my dad gets here
tomorrow.

33:02.980 --> 33:05.403
Australia is a long way.

33:08.980 --> 33:13.190
I can't believe that
this is happening.

33:13.250 --> 33:15.981
How is this happening?

33:17.190 --> 33:21.889
I'll take care
of you, ok?

33:21.960 --> 33:23.724
You saved me.

33:23.800 --> 33:27.998
Now it's time for me
to save you.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.435
I don't know what I'd
do without you, zoe.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.037
You're a good friend.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.029
I love you.

33:41.450 --> 33:43.009
Oh. We should go.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.579
I left my cell
in the car.

33:44.650 --> 33:46.072
Dave's sister's been
trying to reach me.

33:46.150 --> 33:49.085
I have to start
dealing with this.

33:49.160 --> 33:52.084
Wait. No, nicole.

33:54.960 --> 33:59.193
I mean, I-I love you.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.419
Ever since the day
you rescued me,

34:01.500 --> 34:02.865
I...

34:02.870 --> 34:07.137
I felt like we
had something, you know?

34:07.210 --> 34:08.962
I felt...

34:09.040 --> 34:11.077
Our connection.

34:13.010 --> 34:16.742
Nobody's ever given
a damn about me.

34:16.820 --> 34:22.213
For the first time, I felt like
I had a-a reason to be here.

34:23.719 --> 34:26.313
It's to be with you.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.396
Zoe, what are you
doing?

34:33.400 --> 34:36.734
I went with dave to pick
out your engagement ring.

34:36.739 --> 34:39.266
I knew it was
the wrong size,

34:39.340 --> 34:42.059
But he wouldn't listen.

34:44.780 --> 34:46.998
It was all wrong anyway.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.502
You're more
of a vintage girl.

34:48.580 --> 34:50.070
<i>70, don't.</i>

34:50.080 --> 34:51.241
I know. I'm sorry.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.945
My timing sucks.

34:53.020 --> 34:56.650
Zoe, we're just
friends.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.018
That's all
we'll ever be.

35:07.470 --> 35:09.689
It was you.

35:15.110 --> 35:16.305
Ohh!

35:16.380 --> 35:17.700
[gasping]

35:24.720 --> 35:25.448
They're not at zoe's
place. Where's security?

35:25.450 --> 35:26.679
We had a unit
on the street,

35:26.750 --> 35:28.286
But they weren't notified
the girls were leaving.

35:28.290 --> 35:29.644
Nicole's not
answering her cell.

35:29.720 --> 35:31.119
We put out a bolo
on zoe parsons.

35:31.130 --> 35:32.689
We've got every cop in
the area searching for her.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.728
What if this is more
than just hero worship?

35:34.790 --> 35:35.655
What do you mean?

35:35.660 --> 35:37.298
It's similar to the
florence nightingale effect

35:37.300 --> 35:39.359
Where the patient falls
in love with the caregiver,

35:40.230 --> 35:41.664
Only in this case
maybe zoe fell in love

35:41.730 --> 35:43.164
With the woman
who saved her life.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.163
And dave's proposal made zoe
realize she had to get rid of him.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.959
So she snuck away from the
bonfire, attacked him in the tunnel.

35:47.980 --> 35:50.130
And used mike harris'
lighter to frame him

35:50.140 --> 35:51.505
Because she knew that
mike still loved nicole.

35:51.580 --> 35:53.708
It all makes sense
except for one thing.

35:53.780 --> 35:55.145
If zoe loves nicole,

35:55.150 --> 35:56.242
Why scare her
under the pier?

35:56.250 --> 35:59.174
So nicole would come to
her, seeking emotional support

35:59.250 --> 36:01.218
Except zoe didn't count
mike showing up

36:01.290 --> 36:02.382
And ruining
the moment.

36:02.460 --> 36:04.315
With the police involved,
she's gonna act fast.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.412
Where would she
take her?

36:05.490 --> 36:07.151
Where would you take
someone to profess your love?

36:07.160 --> 36:10.095
I would take her to the
place where we first met.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.150
Beth: The pier.

36:11.170 --> 36:13.593
She saved her
at the pier.

36:13.670 --> 36:15.229
Ohh! Unh!

36:15.300 --> 36:16.267
Zoe, don't.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.535
You know, all
I ever wanted was

36:17.600 --> 36:18.738
For us to be together.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.768
Zoe, please
just let me go.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.660
It was all
for you, nicole.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.170
You killed dave.

36:24.180 --> 36:27.548
Look. I know that-- that
it's hard for you to hear this,

36:27.610 --> 36:33.185
But I did it
for you, for us.

36:33.190 --> 36:35.249
Zoe, no.

36:35.320 --> 36:39.257
It's ok now
because we're together,

36:39.330 --> 36:43.198
And now we can be
together forever.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.429
What are you
talking about?

36:44.500 --> 36:48.528
Because we're
gonna jump together.

36:48.540 --> 36:49.462
Come on.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.692
Nicole,
come back here.

36:52.710 --> 36:54.906
[siren]

36:54.970 --> 36:56.062
Lock it down.

36:56.140 --> 36:57.403
[radio chatter]

36:57.480 --> 36:59.278
Check the parking lot.
Set up a perimeter.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.375
Nobody gets off the pier
unless I say.

37:01.380 --> 37:02.245
Yes, ma'am.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.140
Come on. You
heard her. Let's go.

37:04.220 --> 37:06.416
[ Nicole screams]|]

37:07.890 --> 37:10.257
Come on, nicole.

37:10.320 --> 37:11.617
You go first.

37:11.690 --> 37:12.953
[crying]

37:13.030 --> 37:15.249
Come on, nicole!

37:18.730 --> 37:20.095
Come on.

37:20.170 --> 37:20.966
Unh!

37:21.030 --> 37:24.239
[groaning]

37:24.240 --> 37:25.492
Get away
from me!

37:25.570 --> 37:26.560
Stay away!

37:26.570 --> 37:27.731
Stay away from me.

37:27.740 --> 37:28.969
Jack: Zoe, don't!

37:29.040 --> 37:30.303
Beth: Zoe, come on down.
Let's talk about this.

37:30.380 --> 37:31.336
No. There's nothing
to talk about.

37:31.410 --> 37:33.845
Nicole: Zoe, just let
them help you.

37:33.910 --> 37:35.400
No. I have to
do this.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.469
No because then--
then you can save me,

37:38.550 --> 37:39.745
You know, like
you did before,

37:39.750 --> 37:41.286
And--and we can
start over.

37:41.350 --> 37:43.512
That's not how
this works.

37:43.590 --> 37:45.581
Yes, it is!

37:45.590 --> 37:47.854
Just let me
help you now.

37:47.930 --> 37:52.322
Just please come--
come down from there.

37:58.240 --> 38:00.208
Can you forgive me?

38:00.270 --> 38:01.829
Yes.

38:01.910 --> 38:05.471
Just please don't
make me hurt anymore.

38:05.540 --> 38:08.271
I can't lose
you, too.

38:11.150 --> 38:13.539
No! Ohh! No!

38:13.620 --> 38:15.543
Let go of me!

38:15.620 --> 38:17.850
Nicole! Nicole!

38:17.920 --> 38:20.230
I love you, nicole!

38:20.290 --> 38:22.156
I love you!

38:22.230 --> 38:24.995
[sobbing]

38:27.400 --> 38:30.563
[music playing]

38:52.430 --> 38:56.526
Beth: The arresting officer
found this on zoe.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.228
I believe it
belongs to you.

39:03.970 --> 39:05.859
Thank you.

39:08.040 --> 39:10.407
I'm so sorry.

39:20.450 --> 39:21.747
Nice job today, guys.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.515
I'll meet you
back at the house?

39:23.520 --> 39:25.386
You don't have to
keep switching off.

39:25.460 --> 39:27.519
I know you guys have
lives. Go live them.

39:27.530 --> 39:28.782
I'm not missing
anything,

39:28.860 --> 39:30.089
And we're happy
to hang.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.355
Thank you.
I appreciate it,

39:31.370 --> 39:34.294
But I have a uni
outside my house.

39:34.370 --> 39:35.394
I'll be fine.

39:35.470 --> 39:37.859
We know that.
Not the point.

39:37.870 --> 39:40.134
Go home.
Get some sleep.

39:40.210 --> 39:44.408
I'll see you
in the morning.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.538
Do we buy it?

39:45.550 --> 39:47.439
Maybe we're
smothering her.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.375
Do we let it ride?

39:48.380 --> 39:50.917
She's the boss.

39:50.980 --> 39:53.586
[music continues]

39:53.650 --> 39:56.039
Trent.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.482
Coming by tonight?

39:57.560 --> 40:00.450
I don't think
that's a good idea.

40:00.530 --> 40:02.453
Why not?

40:02.530 --> 40:04.419
Amanda...

40:04.500 --> 40:06.491
You know, what
we do here, our work,

40:06.570 --> 40:09.426
It's really complicated,
and life is complicated,

40:09.500 --> 40:12.299
But when I go home,
things have to simplify,

40:12.370 --> 40:14.407
They have to get
easier.

40:14.410 --> 40:16.970
They can't always
be easy, trent.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.405
I know they can't
always be easier,

40:18.410 --> 40:19.434
But they have to
be honest.

40:19.510 --> 40:21.342
I know that jack
showing up

40:21.410 --> 40:24.516
Has made things
very difficult,

40:24.580 --> 40:27.584
But I have tried to be
honest with you, trent.

40:27.590 --> 40:28.580
I know. You have tried.

40:28.590 --> 40:33.460
_ You're not
quite there yet, though,

40:33.530 --> 40:34.656
With yourself.

40:34.730 --> 40:37.859
We both know what
I'm talking about here.

40:37.930 --> 40:38.829
Trent, don't--

40:38.900 --> 40:41.528
Look. I know jack
is ethan's father,

40:41.600 --> 40:42.863
And--and I get it.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.193
It's not even
about that.

40:45.270 --> 40:49.605
Things are getting too
complicated here, amanda.

40:49.610 --> 40:52.830
So I'm gonna sit
this out for now.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.028
Everything ok?

41:10.900 --> 41:13.460
Yeah.

41:13.470 --> 41:15.393
You know, before
I screwed everything up,

41:15.470 --> 41:18.132
You and I were
good friends.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.892
I remember.

41:19.970 --> 41:22.564
So if you need
to talk...

41:24.680 --> 41:27.672
Thank you. I'm fine.

41:27.750 --> 41:29.969
Good night, jack.

41:29.980 --> 41:31.050
Good night.

41:31.120 --> 41:35.045
[music continues]

41:35.120 --> 41:37.088
[doorbell rings]

41:46.930 --> 41:48.819
Hey, jack.
What's up?

41:48.840 --> 41:50.695
Can I come in?

41:50.770 --> 41:51.669
Oh, yeah.

41:51.670 --> 41:54.162
I was just doing
the dishes.

41:54.170 --> 41:56.537
I said back at the
office that I was fine.

41:56.610 --> 41:57.600
You're fine,
and you're good,

41:57.680 --> 41:58.909
And you appreciate
what we're doing.

41:58.980 --> 42:00.607
I know. I got it.
Just stop all that.

42:00.680 --> 42:02.546
I'm here now,
and I just--

42:02.620 --> 42:04.679
I just needed some
company tonight,

42:04.680 --> 42:06.717
And I brought food.

42:06.790 --> 42:10.681
We got sweet, we
got something salty,

42:10.690 --> 42:13.409
Something sweet
and salty,

42:13.490 --> 42:14.719
And look at this.

42:14.790 --> 42:20.194
Movies. You want
to watch a movie?

42:20.200 --> 42:22.623
Jack.
What?

42:28.540 --> 42:30.406
Nothing.
