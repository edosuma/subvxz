44:49.479 --> 44:52.482
I CAN'T LEAVE MY HOME.

44:52.482 --> 44:55.527
DON'T SQUASH MY DREAM OF US
BUILDING A FUTURE TOGETHER.

44:55.527 --> 44:59.447
I CAN'T TAKE IT, ESPECIALLY NOW.
I'M TOO WEAK.

44:59.447 --> 45:03.326
- FRANK...
WHAT ABOUT MY DREAMS

45:03.326 --> 45:07.122
OF SEEING THE WORLD,
IN THIS--THIS?

45:07.122 --> 45:10.751
- WE CAN TAKE A VACATION
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

45:10.751 --> 45:12.795
AND THEN...

45:12.795 --> 45:14.462
WE'LL COME BACK

45:14.462 --> 45:16.923
TO THE LITTLE NEST
THAT WE'VE BUILT FOR OURSELVES.

45:16.923 --> 45:20.844
OH, MY GOD.
I LOVE YOU, SHEILA JACKSON--

45:20.844 --> 45:24.765
I MEAN SHEILA GALLAGHER.
- AW.

45:24.765 --> 45:27.851
OH, FRANK.

45:29.435 --> 45:32.605
[door closes]

45:35.400 --> 45:37.569
- DEBS, ARE YOU SMOKING?

45:37.569 --> 45:41.364
- I'M JUST HOLDING IT.
- WHY?

45:41.364 --> 45:43.867
- I'M EXPERIMENTING
WITH THINGS ADULTS DO.

45:43.867 --> 45:47.996
I DON'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH.

45:47.996 --> 45:50.665
- YOU NEED TO TALK?

45:53.126 --> 45:54.460
- I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,

45:54.460 --> 45:56.796
BUT I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT

45:56.796 --> 45:59.340
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE
HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.968
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD
HOW TO FEEL.

46:05.388 --> 46:08.224
- OKAY.

46:08.224 --> 46:12.645
- SO I'M GONNA TELL YOU, AND...

46:12.645 --> 46:15.064
THAT'S IT.

46:15.064 --> 46:17.984
OKAY?

46:17.984 --> 46:19.319
- OKAY.

46:21.779 --> 46:24.324
- I HAD SEX LAST NIGHT...

46:24.324 --> 46:27.202
MY FIRST TIME.

46:30.413 --> 46:31.957
- JUST...

46:31.957 --> 46:34.918
TELL ME...
YOU WERE CAREFUL.

46:40.840 --> 46:43.968
[sighs]

47:03.780 --> 47:04.948
- HOMEMADE BEER OKAY?

47:04.948 --> 47:06.991
- OH, I'M FINE WITH WATER.
THANK YOU.

47:06.991 --> 47:09.786
[chuckles]
- OH, OKAY.

47:11.997 --> 47:15.291
[gasps]
HOO!

47:15.291 --> 47:17.961
THAT IS STRONG.

47:17.961 --> 47:21.005
LOOK AT THOSE SOCKS...
- OH.

47:21.005 --> 47:24.592
- MAN WITH TASTE.
- [chuckles]

47:24.592 --> 47:26.261
[clears throat]

47:35.270 --> 47:35.311
OH, OH, UM, LISTEN,
LOOK, I-I REALLY LIKE YOU.

47:39.816 --> 47:42.860
YOU'RE A TRUE GENTLEMAN,
AND I DON'T MEET MANY OF THOSE,

47:42.860 --> 47:45.113
WHICH IS...

47:45.113 --> 47:48.700
WHY I WANT TO TAKE THINGS SLOW.
- HUH?

47:48.700 --> 47:50.618
- I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES THAT I HAVE

47:50.618 --> 47:55.373
WITH THE LAST 30 OR 40 GUYS
I'VE BEEN WITH.

47:55.373 --> 47:56.833
- BY "TAKE IT SLOW," YOU MEAN

47:56.833 --> 47:59.043
WE CAN GET AT IT
AFTER I FINISH MY WATER?

47:59.043 --> 48:00.378
- [chuckles]
OH.

48:00.378 --> 48:03.798
NO, NO, I MEAN, YOU KNOW...

48:03.798 --> 48:08.261
GO OUT ON A FEW DATES,
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER.

48:08.261 --> 48:10.054
- BUT FRANK PROMISED
YOU WOULD BONE ME

48:10.054 --> 48:12.974
AS SOON AS WE GOT BACK
TO YOUR TRAILER.

48:12.974 --> 48:14.183
- WHAT?

48:14.183 --> 48:17.980
- COME ON, YOU BEAUTIFUL
HUNK OF JUNK.

48:17.980 --> 48:20.440
- JEEZ, IT'S HOT
DOWN HERE, FRANK.

48:20.440 --> 48:22.692
- I TRIPLED THE GAS, TO MAKE
THINGS GO A LITTLE FASTER.

48:22.692 --> 48:24.694
- WOW.

48:24.694 --> 48:27.905
FRANK, I'VE DECIDED
WHEN ERNIE COMES WITH THE R.V.

48:27.905 --> 48:31.326
TO TELL HIM TO TURN IT AROUND
AND TAKE IT BACK HOME.

48:31.326 --> 48:34.704
- YOU'RE KEEPING THE HOUSE?
- I WANT TO BE WITH YOU...

48:34.704 --> 48:38.708
AND REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT
TO OUR PARTNERSHIP

48:38.708 --> 48:40.752
- OH, YOU--
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

48:40.752 --> 48:42.962
MAYBE LATER.
- HEY!

48:42.962 --> 48:46.924
YOU DANGLED ME LIKE A SEX CARROT
TO GET BREWERY EQUIPMENT?

48:46.924 --> 48:49.927
- YOU WERE LONELY. I WAS KILLING
TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE.

48:49.927 --> 48:52.388
- WELL, I--
- I DON'T LIKE YOUR TONE.

48:52.388 --> 48:54.099
- HE PROMISED THAT MAN

48:54.099 --> 48:56.184
THAT I WOULD PUT OUT
ON THE FIRST DATE.

48:56.184 --> 48:58.519
- I'VE SEEN YOU PUT OUT
AFTER THE FIRST DRINK.

48:58.519 --> 49:00.938
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!

49:00.938 --> 49:04.942
[shouting]
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

49:04.942 --> 49:06.986
- DISGUSTING!

49:06.986 --> 49:09.614
I'M GONNA FUCKING KILL YOU!

49:09.614 --> 49:12.784
- SHE--OH, EXCUSE US.

49:14.202 --> 49:18.039
- [sniffs, exhales deeply]

49:18.039 --> 49:21.001
- GET THE FUCK BACK HERE,
YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!

49:21.001 --> 49:23.127
YOU ARE NOT GETTING AWAY
FROM THIS SHIT!

49:23.127 --> 49:26.172
I'M SO--GOD DAMN YOU!
FUCK YOU!

49:26.172 --> 49:27.673
- GET OFF HIM!
- FUCK YOU!

49:27.673 --> 49:29.509
- GET OFF HIM!
- GET OFF OF ME, YOU CUNT!

49:29.509 --> 49:30.927
OW!
- JESUS!

49:30.927 --> 49:32.428
- DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE CALLED ME?

49:32.428 --> 49:34.305
- ALL RIGHT, SHEILA--
- FRANK, THAT IS NOT RIGHT.

49:34.305 --> 49:36.140
NO, SHE SHOULD NOT BE
TALKING TO YOUR WIFE LIKE THAT.

49:36.140 --> 49:38.142
- I HOPE YOU DIE...
- SERIOUSLY, FRANK--

49:38.142 --> 49:40.103
- IN A BOTTLE OF DIARRHEA!

49:40.103 --> 49:42.855
- THAT IS AN UNACCEPTABLE--
- I AM YOUR FLESH AND BLOOD--

49:42.855 --> 49:44.565
- DO SOMETHING, FRANK!
- SHE IS NOBODY!

49:44.565 --> 49:45.983
- ALL RIGHT,
CAN THE BOTH OF YOU...

49:45.983 --> 49:48.027
- I AM YOUR FLESH AND BLOOD!
- JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP?

49:48.027 --> 49:51.697
CAN WE NOT HAVE ONE MOMENT
OF PEACE?

49:51.697 --> 49:53.200
CHRIST!

49:53.200 --> 49:55.868
I'VE GOT A RAGING LUNATIC
SUCCUBUS

49:55.868 --> 49:58.037
OF A DAUGHTER, ON ONE HAND,

49:58.037 --> 50:01.791
AND A LUMPY, SMOTHERING PERVERT
OF A WIFE, ON THE OTHER!

50:01.791 --> 50:04.627
AND YOU ARE BOTH DRIVING ME
FUCKING INSANE!

50:04.627 --> 50:07.089
- DADDY!
- DON'T YOU "DADDY" ME!

50:07.089 --> 50:09.382
YOU ARE NEEDY.
YOU ARE SLUTTY.

50:09.382 --> 50:11.801
YOUR SON IS A LUMP
OF PURE MISERY.

50:11.801 --> 50:14.887
AND YOU HAVE
DISGUSTING PERSONAL HYGIENE.

50:14.887 --> 50:16.264
AND YOU.
- WHAT?

50:16.264 --> 50:18.183
- YOU ARE A CERTIFIED WHACK JOB!
- WHAT?

50:18.183 --> 50:20.768
- YOU COULDN'T GO OUT
OF YOUR HOUSE FOR TWO YEARS.

50:20.768 --> 50:23.938
YOU TAKE GREAT PLEASURE
IN SHOVING FAKE PENISES

50:23.938 --> 50:25.940
UP THE BUTTS OF THE MEN
YOU LOVE.

50:25.940 --> 50:28.651
YOU BANGED THE HUSBAND
OF YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER.

50:28.651 --> 50:30.945
YOU ADOPTED A BUNCH
OF INDIAN KIDS,

50:30.945 --> 50:32.655
AND WHO THE FUCK KNOWS WHY?

50:32.655 --> 50:35.242
AND I CANNOT STAND

50:35.242 --> 50:38.286
YOUR UNREASONABLY COMPLICATED
COOKING!

50:38.286 --> 50:41.164
- [crying]

50:41.164 --> 50:43.458
- OH, JESUS CHRIST!

50:43.458 --> 50:46.919
CAN'T A MAN GET
ONE FUCKING MINUTE OF PEACE?

50:46.919 --> 50:49.172
JUST ONE MINUTE?

50:51.174 --> 50:52.550
- HOLY SHIT!

50:52.550 --> 50:54.218
- MUST'VE BEEN
THE EXTRA PROPANE.

50:54.218 --> 50:57.138
- WHERE'S HANZI?

50:57.138 --> 50:58.556
- THAT'S A NICE SOCK.

50:58.556 --> 51:02.310
- CHUCKIE!
