00:03.159 --> 00:04.492
Great news, Mrs. Warner,

00:04.626 --> 00:05.793
we found your brother Chris.

00:05.827 --> 00:07.795
Oh, thank goodness. Is he okay?

00:07.829 --> 00:09.363
Uh, perfectly fine.

00:09.398 --> 00:12.098
Although he is now your sister Christina.

00:13.167 --> 00:15.235
He's... really pretty.

00:15.269 --> 00:17.938
I know. Those cheekbones, right?

00:17.972 --> 00:19.372
Why didn't he...

00:19.407 --> 00:21.074
She tell me?

00:21.108 --> 00:24.110
Uh, I don't know. You can ask her yourself.

00:24.145 --> 00:26.346
Neiman Marcus, 12:00. That's what she said.

00:26.380 --> 00:28.281
Neimans?

00:28.316 --> 00:30.951
It's the annual shoe sale.

00:32.086 --> 00:34.287
If she gets those size 12 Louboutins first,

00:34.322 --> 00:36.089
I'll kill her.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.358
Uh, you know, even if you kill her,

00:38.392 --> 00:40.126
you have to pay us.

00:40.161 --> 00:42.195
Thank God you're here!

00:49.036 --> 00:50.370
Uh, let me guess, you went
to get your Gaga tickets

00:50.404 --> 00:54.140
- and they were sold out.
- No, I got third row.

00:57.445 --> 00:59.379
Then why are you acting like
it's the end of the world?

01:00.982 --> 01:02.115
You haven't heard?

01:02.149 --> 01:04.284
You're gonna need to sit down for this.

01:05.319 --> 01:07.220
Okay, I'm sitting. What?

01:07.255 --> 01:09.055
Holly's dead.

01:09.090 --> 01:10.357
It's all over the Internet.

01:10.391 --> 01:13.326
Oh, really? How did she die?

01:13.361 --> 01:16.162
She was at conveyor belt
Sushi restaurant last night

01:16.197 --> 01:19.399
when she reached a little bit
too far for a spicy tuna roll.

01:19.433 --> 01:22.269
And suddenly her silk scarf
got caught in the gears

01:22.303 --> 01:25.238
and she was strangled to death!

01:27.208 --> 01:29.943
Nick, Honey, she's not dead.

01:29.977 --> 01:31.111
I talked to her this morning.

01:31.145 --> 01:34.080
Charlie, I was in denial, too.

01:34.115 --> 01:35.415
But it was on "T. M. Z.",

01:35.449 --> 01:37.951
and I'm pretty sure they fact-check.

01:37.985 --> 01:39.419
Believe me,

01:39.453 --> 01:42.289
I would give anything

01:42.356 --> 01:45.158
to see Holly walk through
that door right now.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.060
Oh, how about your Gaga tickets?

01:47.094 --> 01:48.261
Yes, anything.

01:48.296 --> 01:50.397
Oh, that line was so long,

01:50.431 --> 01:51.998
I need to get my roots done.

01:52.033 --> 01:54.167
Oh! You're alive!

01:56.137 --> 01:57.437
Yes!

01:59.040 --> 02:00.006
Uh-oh.

02:01.342 --> 02:03.209
Holly, I got us Gaga tickets.

02:25.967 --> 02:27.100
You're alive.

02:28.202 --> 02:30.103
I am.

02:35.409 --> 02:37.310
Wait, should I not be?

02:38.412 --> 02:40.180
There's a rumor that you're dead.

02:40.214 --> 02:43.283
Ugh, why are there always
rumors about me dying?

02:43.317 --> 02:46.086
Because you're always doing crazy stuff.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.054
You make them easy to believe.

02:48.089 --> 02:50.290
You don't see rumors about me, do you?

02:50.324 --> 02:51.958
What are they gonna say?

02:51.993 --> 02:53.994
"Charlie contour eats
cookie dough for breakfast!"

02:54.028 --> 02:56.062
Ooh, that's scandalous.

02:56.097 --> 02:58.431
If you really want them to stop,

02:58.466 --> 03:01.134
maybe you should stop making
them so easy to believe.

03:01.168 --> 03:02.302
Who said I want them to stop?

03:02.336 --> 03:04.137
I kind of love them.

03:04.171 --> 03:06.039
Ooh, remember that one

03:06.073 --> 03:07.907
where they said I died of a shark attack

03:07.942 --> 03:09.242
on "Celebrity Lifeguard"?

03:09.276 --> 03:10.944
Yeah, that was ridiculous.

03:10.978 --> 03:12.379
You never even once jumped in the water.

03:12.413 --> 03:15.281
Well, duh, 'cause of sharks.

03:17.051 --> 03:18.118
Nick, alert the media,

03:18.152 --> 03:19.386
tell them that holly's alive and well,

03:19.420 --> 03:20.987
so we can get back to work.

03:21.022 --> 03:23.056
Ooh, would you mind if we waited

03:23.090 --> 03:24.290
6 hours and 11 minutes?

03:24.325 --> 03:26.126
There's a crazy bidding war going on

03:26.160 --> 03:28.128
for some of Holly's old
birth control packets.

03:36.170 --> 03:38.304
I can't believe you're selling all my stuff

03:38.339 --> 03:40.073
before my body's even cold.

03:40.107 --> 03:42.375
No, I was already selling
this stuff when you were alive.

03:42.410 --> 03:44.277
Your death just jacked up the prices.

03:44.311 --> 03:46.046
What?

03:46.080 --> 03:48.248
Amazing. Oh my God.

03:48.282 --> 03:51.184
Bidding's up to $200 for my parking ticket.

03:51.218 --> 03:52.952
Wait, I thought you paid that?

03:52.987 --> 03:54.020
What do you care? You're dead.

03:54.055 --> 03:56.022
Oh, that's right.

03:56.057 --> 03:59.225
In that case, here's
two more from yesterday.

03:59.260 --> 04:00.994
Hey, geniuses,

04:01.028 --> 04:03.029
what are people gonna say
when they find out she's alive?

04:03.064 --> 04:04.364
Hallelujah! She has risen.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.004
<i>I'm home.</i>

04:11.038 --> 04:12.038
Come on, let's sit down.

04:12.073 --> 04:13.206
- Okay.
- All right.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.941
Where's Demi?

04:14.975 --> 04:18.077
And all the crap that usually
covers our flat surfaces?

04:18.112 --> 04:19.178
Demi's doing her homework,

04:19.213 --> 04:20.947
- I cleaned.
- Wow.

04:20.981 --> 04:22.082
Let me get you some wine.

04:22.116 --> 04:25.318
If whatever is on your
mind is that bad, then yeah,

04:25.352 --> 04:27.187
I will take that.

04:27.221 --> 04:28.221
And that.

04:30.091 --> 04:33.993
Okay, Honey, listen.

04:34.028 --> 04:36.062
It's okay. I know.

04:36.130 --> 04:37.063
You do?

04:37.098 --> 04:39.099
Yeah.

04:39.133 --> 04:40.366
Okay, look,

04:40.401 --> 04:43.103
I only faked it last night
because I didn't want to miss

04:43.137 --> 04:45.004
the finale of "Flip this House."

04:46.273 --> 04:47.240
What?

04:47.274 --> 04:48.274
What?

04:48.309 --> 04:52.045
No, no, I know about Holly dying.

04:52.079 --> 04:53.379
You've gotten like 20 messages.

04:53.414 --> 04:55.215
I am so, so sorry.

04:55.249 --> 04:57.016
- Michael, she's...
- A part of you

04:57.051 --> 04:58.051
and always will be.

04:58.085 --> 04:59.252
I know.

04:59.286 --> 05:01.287
If you need me to do anything,
help with preparations...

05:01.322 --> 05:02.922
No no no, you don't understand.

05:02.957 --> 05:05.291
I understand that you
are always trying to be

05:05.326 --> 05:07.227
the strong one, but this time,

05:07.261 --> 05:08.995
let me be your rock.

05:10.030 --> 05:11.264
Mmm!

05:12.933 --> 05:14.033
Really?

05:14.068 --> 05:15.368
Hmm.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.904
Okay, so after dinner

05:17.938 --> 05:19.372
I'm gonna draw you a nice bath,

05:19.406 --> 05:21.941
I'm gonna give you a back massage,

05:21.976 --> 05:23.209
and if you want,

05:23.244 --> 05:25.245
we'll talk about me building that shoe rack

05:25.279 --> 05:27.347
you've been wanting, huh?

05:27.381 --> 05:30.083
The truth is...

05:30.117 --> 05:32.051
I really miss Holly.

05:41.095 --> 05:42.295
What's all that?

05:42.329 --> 05:45.165
Oh, uh, somebody set
up a memorial out front.

05:45.199 --> 05:46.366
I took all I could carry.

05:48.102 --> 05:50.236
Yes. I'm America's sweetheart.

05:50.271 --> 05:52.105
Take that, Taylor Swift!

05:54.208 --> 05:55.241
Ugh. Hey hey hey.

05:55.276 --> 05:57.076
No no no. These are not for you.

05:57.111 --> 05:58.378
You're dead...

05:58.412 --> 06:00.280
Or else you will be when the
people find out you're not.

06:02.016 --> 06:03.950
But all these flowers...

06:03.984 --> 06:06.186
There's roses, peonies...

06:06.220 --> 06:07.987
Ew! Carnations?

06:09.290 --> 06:12.091
Nick, we have a filler flower situation.

06:12.126 --> 06:13.092
Nick!

06:13.127 --> 06:14.294
I'm up! I'm up!

06:14.328 --> 06:17.297
Hey, we got $250 for the sunglasses.

06:17.331 --> 06:20.166
Have you guys been selling stuff all night?

06:20.201 --> 06:22.202
Yep, we've made five grand so far.

06:22.236 --> 06:24.304
We should kill you next.

06:24.338 --> 06:28.208
Okay, you guys need to tell everybody

06:28.242 --> 06:30.276
that you're still alive before
this gets out of control.

06:30.311 --> 06:32.946
I mean, we'll tell everybody

06:32.980 --> 06:34.914
that you were on a cruise to Baja,

06:34.949 --> 06:36.316
and that you didn't hear
about the death rumor

06:36.350 --> 06:37.350
until you got back to shore.

06:37.384 --> 06:40.119
Can it be a cruise to the Greek isles?

06:40.154 --> 06:42.055
Ooh, and maybe throw in
something about meeting

06:42.089 --> 06:44.190
a handsome stranger named Yorgo.

06:45.426 --> 06:46.993
Yorgo?

06:47.027 --> 06:49.062
Who whisked you off to his private island,

06:49.096 --> 06:51.397
where you ate yogurt in
the nude with John Stamos.

06:56.237 --> 06:58.338
- Whose fantasy is this?
- I thought we could share it.

07:00.174 --> 07:02.008
Whatever. Nick, call "T. M.Z."

07:02.042 --> 07:03.142
And get this straightened out, okay?

07:03.177 --> 07:05.879
Ooh, this is new.

07:05.913 --> 07:08.348
You didn't by chance put up
a sex tape for sale, did you?

07:08.382 --> 07:09.949
No.

07:09.984 --> 07:11.117
Or did I?

07:12.219 --> 07:13.253
Maybe.

07:13.287 --> 07:15.955
Well, someone did. And according to this

07:15.990 --> 07:17.023
there's a bunch of companies bidding on it.

07:17.057 --> 07:19.926
How dare someone try to make money

07:19.960 --> 07:22.061
off my fake death while
I'm on a pretend cruise

07:22.096 --> 07:24.063
with my made up boyfriend named Yorgo.

07:25.299 --> 07:28.334
Okay, great. So now there's a sex tape.

07:28.369 --> 07:31.104
Did it ever occur to you
Holly to not do something?

07:31.138 --> 07:33.907
So there's a sex tape. Who cares?

07:33.941 --> 07:35.108
Everyone does 'em.

07:35.142 --> 07:36.910
My grandma last year.

07:39.146 --> 07:41.080
Okay.

07:41.115 --> 07:43.149
Th-that's just gross.

07:44.318 --> 07:48.154
And everybody does not do them.

07:48.188 --> 07:50.323
We're trying to start a business here!

07:50.357 --> 07:53.293
It's hard enough to get
people to take us seriously.

07:53.327 --> 07:55.228
Okay, we've gotta find the tape.

07:55.262 --> 07:56.996
Does it say anything about the seller?

07:57.031 --> 07:58.231
He was on the "Mystery Girls" crew.

07:58.265 --> 07:59.899
- Okay.
- Which season?

07:59.934 --> 08:01.234
I bet it was season three.

08:01.268 --> 08:03.937
That's the year they
gave me my own trailer.

08:03.971 --> 08:06.072
Ooh, he's also selling a blooper reel.

08:06.106 --> 08:07.974
Try and get that, too.

08:08.008 --> 08:09.142
Who was it with?

08:09.176 --> 08:10.176
Who are you looking at?

08:10.210 --> 08:12.145
You! I'm looking at you.

08:12.179 --> 08:14.047
You're the one in the tape. Who
else am I supposed to look at

08:14.081 --> 08:16.349
sorry, it was a really long time ago.

08:16.383 --> 08:18.318
Actually, I have no idea.

08:18.352 --> 08:21.254
But if I saw him I probably
might recognize him.

08:21.288 --> 08:23.323
Okay, okay, okay. We need to find a way

08:23.357 --> 08:25.124
to get the crew back together.

08:25.159 --> 08:27.226
Reunion episode!

08:27.261 --> 08:30.096
Yeah, that's gonna be a little hard to sell

08:30.130 --> 08:31.364
<i>- since one of us is dead.</i>

08:31.398 --> 08:33.166
I've got it!

08:33.200 --> 08:35.902
Why don't you throw a
memorial service for me?

08:35.936 --> 08:38.104
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

08:38.138 --> 08:40.006
You invite the entire crew,

08:40.039 --> 08:42.174
and then once I see all of
them I'll be able to figure out

08:42.208 --> 08:43.241
who's behind this...

08:43.277 --> 08:44.978
And who's behind me on that tape.

08:51.527 --> 08:53.461
Happy Memorial Day.

08:53.495 --> 08:55.530
I told you to be here at 1:00.

08:55.564 --> 08:58.232
Only you'd be late to your own funeral.

08:58.267 --> 08:59.467
Where have you been?

08:59.501 --> 09:01.369
Kinko's, what do you think?

09:03.172 --> 09:05.506
I shall call it "Holly ever after."

09:07.276 --> 09:09.343
Great. And after, we'll enter you

09:09.378 --> 09:11.112
in a toddler pageant.

09:18.487 --> 09:20.087
What?

09:20.122 --> 09:23.057
Nothing.

09:23.091 --> 09:24.225
Come on.

09:24.259 --> 09:26.394
Well...

09:26.428 --> 09:28.396
It's just a girl spends her whole life

09:28.430 --> 09:30.164
dreaming of her memorial.

09:30.199 --> 09:32.200
And you...

09:32.234 --> 09:35.469
You booked at a janky
hotel near the airport.

09:35.504 --> 09:37.071
It smells like vomit.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.341
Okay, I'm sorry, but it's all I could do

09:40.375 --> 09:41.375
on such short notice.

09:41.410 --> 09:43.377
It's not the room that's important,

09:43.412 --> 09:44.478
it's the accessories.

09:44.513 --> 09:47.081
- I brought urns.
- Ooh.

09:47.115 --> 09:50.117
- Which urn do you think you'd look best in?
- Okay.

09:50.152 --> 09:52.220
Nope, nope, nope.

09:52.254 --> 09:54.155
Ugh, they're all so big.

09:54.189 --> 09:56.224
Are you suggesting I have fat ashes?

09:58.260 --> 10:01.095
Fine, I'll just take
that slimming, pink one.

10:01.129 --> 10:02.296
This is my water bottle.

10:02.331 --> 10:03.464
- Perfect.
- Okay.

10:03.498 --> 10:05.366
And you, get up there.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.134
You have to rehearse your speech.

10:07.169 --> 10:10.304
No, I'm not giving a
speech for your fat ash.

10:15.244 --> 10:18.312
I am your best friend.
You have to give a speech.

10:18.347 --> 10:20.281
If you were pretend
dead, I would totally give

10:20.315 --> 10:21.449
a beautiful speech.

10:21.483 --> 10:23.251
Okay, fine.

10:23.285 --> 10:25.319
I will think of something
nice to say, okay?

10:25.354 --> 10:33.258
No need, here you go. Come on.

10:33.292 --> 10:35.426
"Holly Hamilton, friend I hardly deserved."

10:35.461 --> 10:37.529
- Seriously?
- Oh.

10:37.563 --> 10:40.265
See, I drew teardrops next to the sentences

10:40.299 --> 10:41.533
where you should cry.

10:41.567 --> 10:45.303
"Holly Hamilton was a
flower in a sea of gravel,

10:45.337 --> 10:48.540
a beacon to lost ships..."

10:48.574 --> 10:50.441
Teardrop.

10:52.211 --> 10:54.512
"...a priceless masterpiece
that walked among us"?

10:54.547 --> 10:56.247
Oh, come on!

10:56.282 --> 10:59.183
I'm not doing this. We have
to go over our plan, okay?

10:59.218 --> 11:01.185
What? I see people and I try

11:01.220 --> 11:02.520
to remember if I had sex with them.

11:02.588 --> 11:04.188
Teardrop.

11:08.427 --> 11:09.427
Is that the guy?

11:11.463 --> 11:12.463
Is that the guy?

11:14.233 --> 11:15.400
Is that the guy?

11:15.434 --> 11:18.136
I need to see more than their faces.

11:22.241 --> 11:23.207
Is that the guy?

11:26.579 --> 11:28.146
I don't know if you remember me

11:28.180 --> 11:30.582
but I did craft services
and sold weed to the crew.

11:30.616 --> 11:33.117
Jeanette!

11:35.437 --> 11:37.571
Holly spoke fondly of you.

11:37.606 --> 11:40.541
I'm her cousin Dolly Hamilton.

11:41.610 --> 11:43.510
Ah, okay. Thank you, Jeanette,

11:43.545 --> 11:46.313
- so much for coming.
- Do you know where the refreshments are?

11:46.348 --> 11:47.448
I'm kind of baked.

11:52.454 --> 11:54.188
"Dolly Hamilton"?

11:54.222 --> 11:55.489
What is with that accent?

11:55.523 --> 11:58.359
I'm undercover, fool.

11:58.393 --> 12:00.427
Just let me do the talking.

12:00.462 --> 12:02.396
You've already done enough with that mouth.

12:04.566 --> 12:07.401
Hey, my man, Frank here,
had the hardest job.

12:07.435 --> 12:10.070
Assistant director. Oh, man.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.072
We'd be in the middle of filming

12:12.107 --> 12:13.540
and Holly would just wander off.

12:13.575 --> 12:15.509
It got so bad, we had to put

12:15.543 --> 12:17.378
a tracking chip in her shoulder.

12:17.412 --> 12:19.246
Told her it was a flu shot.

12:21.216 --> 12:23.517
Wait, what?

12:23.551 --> 12:25.219
Is that the guy?

12:25.253 --> 12:26.287
I'm not sure.

12:26.321 --> 12:28.155
But now I know why my shoulder tingles

12:28.189 --> 12:30.257
every time my cellphone rings.

12:30.292 --> 12:33.127
Say, any of you guys ever make

12:33.161 --> 12:35.529
a risque video tape with the departed?

12:35.563 --> 12:38.299
I'm just making conversation of course,

12:38.333 --> 12:39.433
but did you?

12:40.734 --> 12:42.734
You know anything
about that Franck?

12:43.243 --> 12:46.544
Shut up, T-Bird, I'm not
gonna talk about that here.

12:46.578 --> 12:48.179
Oh, come on, Man.

12:48.213 --> 12:50.348
Yeah, come on, Man.

12:50.382 --> 12:53.384
Yeah, Dude. Dude time.

12:53.419 --> 12:54.552
It's on V.H.S.,

12:54.586 --> 12:57.455
which makes it 10 times nastier.

12:59.291 --> 13:02.460
It's Frank. Ew, I did Frank?

13:02.494 --> 13:05.363
Ugh, okay. We have got to get that tape.

13:05.397 --> 13:07.098
Come on.

13:07.132 --> 13:10.068
I bet he is in the guestbook.

13:10.102 --> 13:11.469
Oh... uh...

13:11.503 --> 13:13.538
Uh-huh, here's his address.

13:13.572 --> 13:15.373
- There's an address?
- Mm-hmm, yes,

13:15.407 --> 13:17.275
so the host can send a thank you.

13:17.309 --> 13:18.543
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

13:18.577 --> 13:21.212
We should go buy thank-you cards?

13:21.246 --> 13:22.547
Try again.

13:22.581 --> 13:25.383
Ah! We should break into Frank's house

13:25.417 --> 13:27.251
- while he's here.
- Ding ding ding.

13:27.286 --> 13:28.353
- Yay.
- Bad news.

13:28.387 --> 13:29.520
Frank says he found a buyer for the tape.

13:29.555 --> 13:31.422
It's okay, we have his address.

13:31.457 --> 13:32.390
Just keep him here.

13:32.424 --> 13:33.491
How am I supposed to do that?

13:33.525 --> 13:36.160
Go up there, give a speech. Stall.

13:36.195 --> 13:39.097
Wait, you want me to spend the
next few hours talking about Holly?

13:39.131 --> 13:40.098
Dream come true.

13:47.388 --> 13:48.588
Stupid hairpin.

13:48.622 --> 13:50.457
This worked all the time on the show.

13:50.491 --> 13:52.459
That's because there was a
crew guy on the other side

13:52.493 --> 13:54.227
opening it for you.

13:54.261 --> 13:55.328
I'm trying.

13:55.362 --> 13:57.630
And my favorite episode of the third season

13:57.665 --> 14:00.433
was when the girls were investigating
a human trafficking ring.

14:00.468 --> 14:03.136
Oh, I remember thinking to myself,

14:03.170 --> 14:06.406
"Oh my God, they must
have gotten a real hooker,"

14:06.440 --> 14:08.374
because Holly was so convincing.

14:11.545 --> 14:14.147
And now, with your permission,
I would like to read

14:14.181 --> 14:16.249
from my collection of
holly-inspired poetry.

14:22.289 --> 14:23.289
Oh my God.

14:23.324 --> 14:26.192
I'm a master criminal.

14:26.227 --> 14:28.294
Your mother would be very proud. Come on.

14:30.331 --> 14:32.265
Intruder alert!

14:32.299 --> 14:33.600
Who's ready to die?

14:36.637 --> 14:37.604
I've got a gun.

14:37.638 --> 14:39.172
Oh no.

14:43.677 --> 14:45.578
Frank must have a roommate.

14:45.613 --> 14:47.480
He's playing some game.

14:49.483 --> 14:51.651
What's it called, "40 and alone"?

14:53.487 --> 14:56.322
We're not here to judge.
We're here to steal.

14:56.357 --> 14:58.324
Let's go find the tape.

15:01.228 --> 15:02.595
Whoa.

15:02.630 --> 15:04.497
- Be careful.
- I am being careful.

15:04.532 --> 15:05.532
You be careful.

15:05.566 --> 15:08.167
You be careful.

15:08.202 --> 15:09.369
Go the other way.

15:09.403 --> 15:10.403
Fine.

15:13.307 --> 15:14.340
Hey, hey.

15:19.346 --> 15:21.180
Boom.

15:21.215 --> 15:22.348
Miss Dirty girl.

15:22.383 --> 15:23.583
I'm on it.

15:28.255 --> 15:29.422
What do you think you're doing?

15:29.456 --> 15:32.325
Housekeeping?

15:32.359 --> 15:34.360
I'm calling the police.

15:34.395 --> 15:35.428
No you're not!

15:37.264 --> 15:38.598
Oh, I can't believe I listened to you.

15:38.632 --> 15:41.167
This has got to be the worst
decision you've ever made.

15:41.201 --> 15:44.404
Nope, worst decision was going
Commando at The Teen Choice awards.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.208
Wait, come back!

15:51.211 --> 15:52.445
I'm a huge fan.

15:55.316 --> 15:58.318
Well, congratulations, you've
finally brought me down to your level.

15:58.352 --> 16:01.120
Come on, that was so fun.

16:01.155 --> 16:03.189
That might be your idea of fun

16:03.223 --> 16:05.325
but I am done cleaning up your messes.

16:05.359 --> 16:08.394
Speaking of messes, what
is so sticky on this tape?

16:11.365 --> 16:12.398
Ew.

16:13.434 --> 16:15.234
Grape soda.

16:15.269 --> 16:16.336
Ready to watch?

16:16.370 --> 16:19.172
Sure, I really do wanna
watch your sex tape.

16:19.206 --> 16:20.340
Make some popcorn,

16:20.374 --> 16:21.608
we'll invite the realtors
from down the hall.

16:21.642 --> 16:24.611
- Really?
- No, I don't want to watch it.

16:24.645 --> 16:26.479
Let's just destroy it.

16:26.513 --> 16:28.214
What if it's not the right one?

16:28.248 --> 16:30.183
All right, fine, put it in the V.C.R.

16:30.217 --> 16:32.452
And why do we have a V.C.R.?

16:32.486 --> 16:34.153
Because, remember,

16:34.188 --> 16:36.422
Nick's selling all my old stuff.

16:36.457 --> 16:39.525
After we watch the sex tape
we can watch my workout video,

16:39.560 --> 16:42.395
"Holly Hamil-tone."

16:42.429 --> 16:45.598
Yippee, a double feature from hell.

16:48.268 --> 16:50.503
- Okay.
- I can't watch this.

16:55.576 --> 16:58.244
Wait a minute, not my moaning.

17:00.247 --> 17:01.481
My moaning.

17:04.617 --> 17:06.586
That's the day we were shooting the episode

17:06.619 --> 17:08.554
where we were dressed like twin gymnasts.

17:08.589 --> 17:12.191
Yes, Helga and Elga.

17:12.226 --> 17:14.127
Frank must have mixed us up,

17:14.161 --> 17:16.262
and I must have blocked
this from my memory.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.330
<i>Well, well, well,</i>

17:18.365 --> 17:22.135
Charlie contour's true colors come out.

17:22.169 --> 17:23.536
Okay, stop it.

17:23.569 --> 17:26.138
No, I mean I see your tan lines.

17:26.173 --> 17:28.473
Wow, who knew your butt was so pale.

17:30.244 --> 17:32.311
Okay, so I had a momentary
lapse in judgment.

17:32.346 --> 17:33.613
Doesn't make me a bad person.

17:33.647 --> 17:35.281
<i>Ooh, yeah,</i>

17:35.315 --> 17:37.183
<i>I'm a bad person.</i>

17:40.654 --> 17:43.322
Uh, okay, that was a poor choice of words.

17:45.225 --> 17:49.295
I don't know. I think maybe
an apology is in order.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.329
Okay.

17:50.364 --> 17:52.298
Maybe occasionally I have...

17:52.332 --> 17:54.467
Been overly judgmental of you.

17:54.501 --> 17:57.437
Uh-huh. And?

18:00.507 --> 18:05.344
And maybe everybody makes
mistakes, including me.

18:05.379 --> 18:06.512
I'm sorry.

18:06.547 --> 18:09.348
Spoken like a true best friend.

18:09.383 --> 18:10.483
Apology accepted.

18:10.517 --> 18:12.151
And...

18:12.186 --> 18:14.487
- Mystery solved.
- Mystery solved.

18:14.521 --> 18:16.189
Wait, wait, wait. What
are you doing with that?

18:16.223 --> 18:17.423
I'm gonna throw it off the balcony.

18:17.458 --> 18:20.359
No! No no no no no no no no no no.

18:20.394 --> 18:21.594
That is not going to destroy it.

18:21.628 --> 18:23.129
Sure it will.

18:25.232 --> 18:27.333
Unless it lands in the back
of that guy's convertible.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.469
Follow that Camaro!

18:38.212 --> 18:40.279
Oh, hello.

18:40.314 --> 18:42.582
Long day at the office.

18:42.616 --> 18:44.183
Really could use that wine.

18:44.218 --> 18:47.253
Oh Gosh, you must be so sad.

18:47.287 --> 18:49.422
You know, I've been thinking,

18:49.456 --> 18:52.358
it might be a good idea to
get you some grief counseling.

18:52.392 --> 18:53.559
Nah.

18:53.594 --> 18:55.361
Wine's fine.

18:55.395 --> 18:56.529
Oh.

18:56.563 --> 18:58.598
You know what you need?

18:58.632 --> 19:00.233
A good cry.

19:00.267 --> 19:02.135
You haven't cried once.

19:02.169 --> 19:04.203
Sure I have.

19:05.506 --> 19:06.472
Come on.

19:09.309 --> 19:11.177
Come on.

19:11.211 --> 19:13.312
- Okay.
- Come to Michael.

19:15.516 --> 19:18.184
There you go. Let it out.

19:24.158 --> 19:25.291
You can do better than that.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.367
You know, don't you?

19:34.401 --> 19:37.236
I saw Holly at Kinko's
blowing up pictures of herself.

19:37.271 --> 19:39.305
Oh, my God, I am so sorry, Michael.

19:39.339 --> 19:40.439
I just...

19:40.474 --> 19:42.408
There was this rumor that Holly was dead,

19:42.442 --> 19:44.210
so she and Nick took advantage of it

19:44.244 --> 19:45.611
and they made a killing on ebay.

19:45.646 --> 19:48.514
Oh yeah, that sounds
like something she'd do.

19:48.549 --> 19:51.450
How about I make us some dinner

19:51.485 --> 19:54.587
and we talk about that shoe
rack you were gonna build me?

19:54.621 --> 19:57.490
Yeah, I don't see that happening

19:57.524 --> 20:00.159
for a long, long time.

20:06.971 --> 20:09.338
It's no mystery how I got this body.

20:09.373 --> 20:12.408
Who's ready to get Holly Hamil-toned?

20:12.442 --> 20:14.343
I am.

20:16.313 --> 20:17.613
How long do we have to do this for?

20:17.648 --> 20:20.216
Till I forgive you for misjudging me.

20:21.351 --> 20:23.386
And left, and thrust.

20:23.420 --> 20:25.388
Right, and left...

20:25.422 --> 20:27.523
Oh, this is dirtier than my sex tape.

20:27.558 --> 20:30.326
I am so glad we did not sell this.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.327
Wait, stop.

20:31.361 --> 20:32.528
We can't do this part.

20:32.563 --> 20:34.263
This is the part that caused the lawsuit.

20:34.298 --> 20:36.566
Fast forward.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.301
And stop.

20:38.335 --> 20:42.338
Hey, look who stopped by to say hi.

20:42.372 --> 20:46.442
It's TV superstar Charlie Contour.

20:46.476 --> 20:48.244
I thought I'd stop by

20:48.278 --> 20:50.279
to help you contour your arms.

20:50.314 --> 20:53.216
Charles, you were in this?

20:53.250 --> 20:55.384
Yep, apparently I blocked
that from my memory, too.

20:56.687 --> 21:00.189
Who's ready for some mystery curls?

21:02.292 --> 21:03.259
I am.
