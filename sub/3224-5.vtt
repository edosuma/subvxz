WEBVTT

00:03.920 --> 00:05.285
Sammy's hurt.
He's hurt real bad.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.880
This one goes out to any
angel with their ears on.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.127
This is Dean Winchester.

00:10.200 --> 00:12.601
And I need your help.

00:12.680 --> 00:13.886
- Start with a name.
- Ezekiel.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.490
There is a chance
I could fix your brother.

00:15.560 --> 00:16.607
How would it work?

00:16.680 --> 00:18.364
I heal Sam,
while I heal myself.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.966
Sam can eject me, at any time.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.447
And if Sam does eject me,
he will die.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.323
Then, we keep it
a secret, for now.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.925
I just got to hope that
you're one of the good guys.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.291
I am.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.125
Zeke!

00:32.159 --> 00:34.003
You can bring her back,
like you did with Cass.

00:36.920 --> 00:38.649
- I cannot keep doing that.
- Why the hell not?

00:38.680 --> 00:40.569
Every time I use my power,

00:40.640 --> 00:42.005
it weakens me.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.121
Merry Christmas.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.080
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.565
Saving people, hunting things.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.641
The family business.

00:49.720 --> 00:50.801
Becky, it's all real.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.041
I knew it.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.531
Nipples?

00:54.960 --> 00:57.327
Come on.
We hunt monsters.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.050
Why am I here?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.162
Where normal people,
they see a monster and they run,

01:01.200 --> 01:02.645
but not us, no, no, no.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.682
We search out things
that want to kill us.

01:05.480 --> 01:06.481
Real. It's real.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.522
- No, no, no.
- Now you die.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.165
You know who does that?
Crazy people.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.162
I'm Batman.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.211
We are insane.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.845
I lost my shoe.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.170
That was scary.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.650
And with a 1:20 left
in the game,

01:25.680 --> 01:27.250
it's 62-54.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.529
This team wants
that championship.

01:30.560 --> 01:31.561
He's got to make the break.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.640
He jumps-

01:32.680 --> 01:34.170
It's good, but the ref's
on the whistle.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.807
He's calling a foul.
Could be charging.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.411
Number 10, he's not
happy about that.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.403
This guy just
about could foul out

01:42.480 --> 01:44.881
and nobody but the ref
wants to see that happen.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.405
Coach Johnson watches the block.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.562
He calls time-out.

01:49.760 --> 01:51.405
Talking to the ref right now.

01:51.406 --> 01:52.925
You know, so far, this game,

01:53.000 --> 01:54.047
there have been
a number of fouls

01:54.080 --> 01:55.206
called by this particular ref,

01:55.280 --> 01:58.682
and that's not gone unnoticed
by players and the like.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.249
Easy, Colonel.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.442
That's right, this ref...

02:04.480 --> 02:06.687
Fifty-four.

02:25.760 --> 02:26.886
Is anyone here?

02:38.720 --> 02:40.290
Oh!

02:45.800 --> 02:47.643
Gets me every time.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.611
What's the matter, boy?

02:55.640 --> 02:56.801
It's me.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.925
What the hell?

03:35.920 --> 03:37.729
Wow.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.290
What?

03:39.480 --> 03:42.882
Kevin, just pour some buffalo milk
down his gob, twice.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.610
Buffalo milk?

03:44.640 --> 03:45.971
Yeah, the hangover cure-all.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.327
It's got everything in it
except buffalo milk.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.051
How's that kid still
recovering from Branson?

03:51.120 --> 03:52.724
What can I say, he's an amateur.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.246
The Slippery Nipple shots
at the Dolly Parton

03:55.320 --> 03:57.163
Dixie stampede nearly
killed the guy.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.850
All right.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.644
Well, I got something
that's gonna get us back

04:00.680 --> 04:02.489
on the road.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.050
- A case?
- Yeah.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.360
You sure you're ready for that?

04:07.160 --> 04:08.480
Why would I not be
ready for that?

04:09.920 --> 04:11.160
Aren't you kind of
running on empty?

04:11.240 --> 04:13.481
Yeah, but the last
three nights straight,

04:13.520 --> 04:14.567
I had eight hours of shut-eye.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.880
For a hunter, that's, like, 20.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.570
Trust me, Dean. I feel good.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.529
Well, that's great and all,
James Brown,

04:19.600 --> 04:21.125
but you're still
recovering from the trials.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.844
I think you ought to pace
yourself, you know?

04:22.880 --> 04:24.120
The sooner you heal...

04:27.440 --> 04:29.204
Yeah?

04:29.240 --> 04:30.207
I just want you back
to your old self.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.366
I am, Dean.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.851
Look, if Kevin's back
on the heaven spell,

04:32.920 --> 04:33.920
Crowley's locked up.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.450
We should be out there,
doing what we do best.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.487
Yeah.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.567
You want to listen, at least?

04:37.640 --> 04:38.687
Okay, great.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.802
Taxidermist named Max Alexander

04:40.880 --> 04:42.370
mysteriously crushed to death.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.289
Nearly every joint
in his body dislocated,

04:44.360 --> 04:45.691
every bone broken.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.721
Poor guy's a human pretzel.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.445
You tell me what's got
that kind of strength.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.363
Demonic luchador?

04:51.440 --> 04:53.727
Shop's a couple hours away,
in Enid, Oklahoma.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.000
We should at least check it out.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.000
Unless there's some reason
you think we shouldn't.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.086
Subtle.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.440
Check that out.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.801
Huh.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.562
Well, the creep factor
just skyrocketed.

05:23.563 --> 05:25.279
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.851
How are you?
Agents Michaels and DeVille.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.245
The body's already been
to the morgue.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.328
Just wrapping it up
with Dave Stephens.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.609
He's the one
who discovered the body.

05:36.680 --> 05:39.251
Such a shame.
I used to go hunting with Max.

05:39.280 --> 05:40.441
He was a real good egg.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.323
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thanks.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.447
You mind showing
my partner around?

05:43.520 --> 05:45.124
I just got a couple of questions
for Mr. Stephens.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.406
Okay. Come on.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.931
Dave Stephens?

05:50.960 --> 05:52.928
I just got
a couple of questions for you,

05:52.960 --> 05:54.041
if that's all right.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.566
I'll tell you
whatever you need to know.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.365
Max was a real pal.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.090
Hunting buddy?

06:02.120 --> 06:03.610
Mm. Yeah.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.967
Lucky guess.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.526
So, about what time
did you discover the body?

06:08.600 --> 06:13.162
About 9:00 AM,
my usual pickup time.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.163
I come in every Wednesday
and Sundays,

06:15.240 --> 06:16.810
uh, to collect the entrails.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.569
The what?

06:19.640 --> 06:20.766
The animal organs.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.647
After Max would
dig them out and work his magic.

06:27.280 --> 06:30.363
He... He was
a real artist, you know?

06:31.760 --> 06:34.764
Strange thing is though,
bins were empty this morning.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.206
Why is that strange?

06:37.280 --> 06:38.884
Well, because it's a Sunday.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.809
Weekend hunts
are pretty much a given

06:40.840 --> 06:41.921
in this neck of the woods,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.685
so they're usually
chock-full of guts.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.445
Ah.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.010
Any chance Max could have
cleaned them out himself?

06:49.080 --> 06:50.844
No. It's a...
it's a biohazard.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.804
You can't just, you know,
throw the stuff out.

06:53.840 --> 06:54.921
You got to burn it.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.086
Huh.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.648
Is there anything else
missing from the shop?

06:59.680 --> 07:02.763
No. The register was full
and the safe was intact.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.411
And all of Max's trophies
were still on the walls.

07:07.320 --> 07:08.367
And was there anybody else here
when you showed up?

07:08.400 --> 07:09.811
No one.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.611
No, other than the Colonel.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.201
Excuse us.

07:21.760 --> 07:22.682
So?

07:22.760 --> 07:24.125
Okay, so, uh,

07:24.200 --> 07:27.044
We got a thief who's
jonesing for animal parts,

07:27.120 --> 07:29.441
we got a pagan symbol,
and we got a human pretzel.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.045
Yeah, it all sounds very witchy,

07:31.080 --> 07:33.242
but I wasn't able to find a hex bag.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.049
All right, well, let's keep digging.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.724
But not here.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.800
I don't like the way
that one's looking at me.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.642
Okay, that symbol in the graffiti,

07:52.720 --> 07:54.290
it's not Wiccan.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.408
It's copywritten.

07:56.440 --> 07:59.808
Local animal rights group,
Enid's answer to PETA.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.839
S.N.A.R.T.?

08:03.840 --> 08:06.207
You got to be kidding me.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.924
Well, it makes sense
that an animal rights group

08:07.960 --> 08:09.720
would have an ax to grind
with a taxidermist.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.562
Why? The animal's already dead.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.563
Yeah, but hunters
are what keep them in business.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.888
Now the question is,
are those bleeding hearts

08:17.920 --> 08:20.764
actually witches
or just hippies?

08:22.880 --> 08:24.325
What's the difference?

08:29.560 --> 08:31.240
Always knew I'd find
the source of all evil

08:31.280 --> 08:32.405
at a vegan bakery.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.289
What's that smell?

08:36.360 --> 08:37.407
Patchouli.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.126
Yeah, mixed with depression
from meat deprivation.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.929
Hey.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.604
You know who wears
sunglasses inside?

08:44.680 --> 08:46.444
Blind people.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.766
And douchebags.

08:54.480 --> 08:57.131
Olivia and Dylan Camrose?

08:57.200 --> 08:58.440
At your service.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.244
You two are members
of S.N.A.R.T.?

09:00.280 --> 09:03.523
Founders and co-presidents,
actually.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.887
Can we interest you
in some literature?

09:07.160 --> 09:08.491
Or a flaxseed scone?

09:08.520 --> 09:10.568
It's wheat-free,
gluten-free, sugar-free,

09:10.640 --> 09:11.641
and surprisingly moist.

09:11.720 --> 09:12.926
Let me stop you right there.

09:12.960 --> 09:18.490
Uh, we're here to investigate
the death of Max Alexander,

09:18.520 --> 09:20.284
a local taxidermist.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.287
He's dead?

09:21.320 --> 09:22.651
You knew him?

09:22.720 --> 09:25.564
Ish. Um... small town.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.165
Well, he was murdered last night,

09:27.240 --> 09:29.641
and a S.N.A.R.T. logo was found
at the crime scene.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.529
You two wouldn't happen to know

09:31.600 --> 09:32.840
anything about that, would you?

09:36.960 --> 09:38.689
His business is funded
by hunters,

09:38.720 --> 09:40.961
and you know how hunters are.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.604
They're selfish dicks

09:42.680 --> 09:44.170
who define themselves
by what they kill.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.961
And as animal advocates,
we couldn't stand for that.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.287
So you killed him?

09:50.320 --> 09:52.322
Of course not.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.362
S.N.A.R.T. doesn't tolerate
violence.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.128
Huh.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.805
This coming from a couple
who spray-paints death threats.

09:58.840 --> 10:01.525
It was a scare tactic.
We just wanted to spook him.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.483
Turns out we were the ones
who got spooked.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.851
What does that mean?

10:08.360 --> 10:11.603
Well, last night,
when we were tagging the joint,

10:11.680 --> 10:12.602
we heard this noise.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.886
A hissing noise.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.121
It freaked us out,
so we ran out into the alley.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.281
But someone attacked us.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.640
Sprayed us in the eyes
with mace.

10:17.720 --> 10:18.881
And it's not like we could go
to the cops.

10:18.960 --> 10:21.122
So now we look
like total douchebags

10:21.200 --> 10:23.362
because we have to wear
our sunglasses inside.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.411
Necrosis?

10:38.480 --> 10:40.369
Premature death of tissues,

10:40.400 --> 10:41.731
that's why their eyes
were all messed up.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.161
And it's not caused by mace.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.366
All right. What caused it?

10:45.400 --> 10:49.644
Right here. "Blunt force,
radiation, venom."

10:49.720 --> 10:51.324
As in, snake?

10:51.400 --> 10:52.606
The taxidermist was constricted.

10:52.680 --> 10:53.886
Olivia and Dylan heard hissing,

10:53.920 --> 10:55.649
and they were sprayed in the eyes.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.768
- By venom.
- By venom.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.968
Okay, so what are we talking here,

11:00.040 --> 11:03.044
some sort of a freaky-ass
snake monster?

11:03.080 --> 11:04.366
Maybe.

11:04.400 --> 11:10.169
The weird thing is snakes
either envenomate or constrict.

11:10.240 --> 11:11.366
No snake does both.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.965
Correction:

11:13.040 --> 11:14.644
Freaky-ass
mega-snake monster.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.680
It could be a Vetala.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.967
Yeah, but they're not afraid
to sink their fangs in.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.042
Taxidermist was bite-free.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.440
It doesn't really fit the profile.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.369
Right. 80...

11:27.080 --> 11:29.082
So call Kevin.
Have him look some stuff up.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.570
Aren't you early, dude?

13:04.960 --> 13:06.086
Dude.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.128
You said you were
from a perfume company.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.759
No, no, please, no!

13:36.560 --> 13:38.210
- Claw marks.
- Yeah.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.004
The cops said
all the cats went missing.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.570
Right, so yesterday, uh,

13:41.640 --> 13:43.051
we're dealing with
some sort of a snake monster.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.286
Today, it's a killer kitty.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.521
I don't know.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.641
Hey.

13:47.920 --> 13:49.200
Why does that mutt
look familiar?

13:56.280 --> 13:59.124
That was the taxidermist's dog.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.770
So he's been
at both crime scenes?

14:01.240 --> 14:02.810
Yeah.

14:03.480 --> 14:04.925
Maybe he's a suspect.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.610
You know, may...

14:08.920 --> 14:12.003
Could be a skinwalker,
maybe a shape-shifter.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.885
Doesn't really look
like a monster to me.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.281
One way to find out.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.324
Come here, boy.
Hey.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.289
This isn't gonna hurt at all.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.731
Unless it hurts.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.410
Hmm.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.042
I guess we can,
uh, rule out killer.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.046
Do you agents need
any further assistance?

14:43.040 --> 14:44.849
Officer, I think we're okay.
Thanks.

14:44.920 --> 14:46.524
All right, well, let me know.

14:48.640 --> 14:52.281
Officer. Excuse me.
Can I borrow your hat?

15:04.080 --> 15:05.366
Good luck getting adopted.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.323
Okay, so
if the Colonel's not a suspect.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.328
Maybe he's a witness.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.170
Hey, boy.
You speak sign language?

15:19.240 --> 15:21.527
- That's monkeys.
- Huh?

15:21.560 --> 15:23.881
You know what?
This is gonna sound crazy.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.371
I read this book
once about this guy

15:25.400 --> 15:27.129
who tried to teach his dog
to speak

15:27.160 --> 15:28.321
after it witnessed a murder.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.647
It worked?

15:30.680 --> 15:32.125
No.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.167
But he wrote a book about it?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.850
Yeah, well, he doesn't have
what we have.

15:34.880 --> 15:37.360
Kevin. Hey, it's me.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.606
How do we speak to a dog?

15:40.680 --> 15:41.841
An Inuit spell?

15:41.880 --> 15:43.325
Yeah.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.682
Who knew the Men of Letters
had its own Eskimo section?

15:48.040 --> 15:50.520
And it's supposed to let us
communicate with the Colonel?

15:50.560 --> 15:51.721
Yeah, well,

15:53.600 --> 15:55.921
that's the plan.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.050
Kevin said it's like a sort of
a human-animal mind-meld.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.565
Meaning?

16:01.640 --> 16:02.687
If it works,

16:02.720 --> 16:05.087
we should be able to read
the Colonel's thoughts.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.401
All right, I'll do it.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.771
You got enough on your plate.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.126
Like What?

16:14.040 --> 16:17.408
Uh... like, you're tired.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.408
You're on the mend, okay?

16:19.440 --> 16:21.886
Plus, you, you've got
a sensitive stomach.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.366
Last thing we need is
you chucking this stuff up, huh?

16:28.240 --> 16:29.571
Doesn't look so bad.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.971
Ahh.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.241
I was wrong.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.329
Come on.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.209
Ha!

16:59.640 --> 17:01.449
All right.
Let's get this party started.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.606
Tell me everything you know.

17:06.119 --> 17:07.645
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

17:11.400 --> 17:12.640
Tough crowd.

17:24.640 --> 17:25.800
So call Kevin.

17:25.880 --> 17:29.123
Spell tasted like ass
and was a bust.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.043
At least it didn't affect
your appetite. Jeez.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.451
Yeah.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.811
Change the station.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.641
Change the station.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.768
- What?
- What?

17:42.800 --> 17:44.643
You shut up, it's working.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.444
It...
Go.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.087
Say that again.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.811
You call this classic rock?

17:52.840 --> 17:55.161
Next thing you know,
they'll be playing Styx.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.010
And Dennis DeYoung? A punk.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.326
Dennis DeYoung's not a punk.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.890
He's Mr. Roboto, bitch.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.167
Why are you arguing
with the dog about Styx?

18:03.200 --> 18:06.090
Yeah. Hey, boy.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.288
What were you trying to tell us
about the cowboy hat?

18:08.320 --> 18:10.687
The douche-wheel
who killed my best friend

18:10.760 --> 18:12.683
was wearing a cowboy hat.

18:12.760 --> 18:14.000
And the pothead, too?

18:14.040 --> 18:16.520
Yep. Same guy killed both.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.841
Ask about the cats.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.965
Yeah, um...

18:22.680 --> 18:24.125
Yeah. And what about the cats?

18:24.200 --> 18:25.326
I don't know.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.407
I don't want this.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.845
I couldn't see much.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.770
I didn't exactly have
the best view in the orphanage.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.207
Oh, but I could smell him.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.284
Guy reeked of red meat,
dishwashing detergent

18:36.360 --> 18:38.886
and tiger balm.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.206
So what's he saying?

18:41.280 --> 18:44.602
That the guy,
he smelled like ground chuck

18:44.680 --> 18:47.729
and soap suds
and old lady cream.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.205
Dean, what are you doing?

18:50.280 --> 18:51.566
I don't know.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.006
What are you laughing at?

18:55.080 --> 18:57.162
Uh...

19:03.120 --> 19:05.088
Hey.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.360
Hey, hey. Yeah.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.562
You. You.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.568
Hey! Hey!

19:11.600 --> 19:12.965
Hey, hey. You. You.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.239
You. You. You.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.642
- Uh, Dean?
- Hm?

19:21.600 --> 19:23.090
I think the spell worked.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.610
In fact, I think it worked
a little too well.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.766
What?

19:25.840 --> 19:28.081
I think you might be a dog.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.360
What?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.890
You're scratching your head.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.491
You're barking at the mailman.
You're playing fetch.

19:33.560 --> 19:34.766
I...

19:41.320 --> 19:43.721
Ruh-roh.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.886
Yeah. No. Okay.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.888
All right, thanks.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.691
So apparently, the Inuit spell
has some side effects.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.364
Oh, well, that would have been
nice to know

19:56.440 --> 19:57.487
before I downed it.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.800
What kind of side effects?

20:00.080 --> 20:01.605
When you mind-meld
with an animal,

20:01.640 --> 20:05.122
it's possible to start
exhibiting some of its behavior.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.970
Don't look at me, Hoss.
It ain't my fault.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.724
Well, how long am I gonna have
the urge to...

20:13.800 --> 20:15.290
Sniff butts?

20:15.400 --> 20:17.402
Oh, whoa. Hey.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.130
I don't have the urge
to sniff butts.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.525
Yet.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.602
Do you really have...
Have the...

20:22.640 --> 20:23.801
No. Come on.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.804
Well, Kevin doesn't know
how long it'll last.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.808
It's not like
it's an exact science, you know?

20:31.840 --> 20:34.320
But hopefully,
when the spell wears off,

20:34.360 --> 20:36.328
so will the side effects.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.484
I wouldn't eat that
if I were you.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.446
Chocolate?

20:44.480 --> 20:45.561
Seriously.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.442
Where we headed?

20:55.520 --> 20:56.851
Back to the shelter.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.770
To sniff out more clues,

20:59.840 --> 21:01.763
maybe dig up
something we missed?

21:01.840 --> 21:03.524
All right, one more doggy pun
out of you,

21:03.600 --> 21:04.840
and I'm gonna
have your nuts clipped.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.002
I hate to break it to you, Hoss.

21:07.080 --> 21:10.004
My sack's emptier
than Santa's after Christmas.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.080
Are you kidding me?

21:15.160 --> 21:16.764
Hey, dick move, pigeon!

21:16.840 --> 21:18.649
Screw you, ass-hat.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.562
Did...

21:20.640 --> 21:22.085
What?

21:22.160 --> 21:23.446
Wait a minute.
Can I hear all animals?

21:23.520 --> 21:24.567
Yep.

21:24.640 --> 21:28.884
Animals have a universal
language like Esperanto.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.691
But this one actually caught on.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.563
And I'm just
getting started, too.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.244
Brewing a real big one. Ha!

21:35.320 --> 21:37.288
Bet your ride's gonna look
sweet in white.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.360
What's he saying?

21:38.400 --> 21:40.402
You...
He's being a douchebag.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.522
Who you calling "douchebag,"
douchebag?

21:42.560 --> 21:44.528
Oh, shut it, you winged rat.

21:44.560 --> 21:45.721
- Dude.
- What?

21:45.760 --> 21:46.727
Just you calm down.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.410
Just get in the car.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.290
That's right, Sally.
Go cry to mama.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.486
Oh, that's it, you son of a bitch!

21:52.560 --> 21:54.289
Dean! Hey! Get in the car.

22:13.440 --> 22:14.487
I think it's probably best

22:14.600 --> 22:15.567
to just leave the Colonel
in the car.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.601
Excuse me?

22:16.680 --> 22:18.125
Well, all the windows are open.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.248
You think We like that?

22:20.280 --> 22:22.089
"We?"

22:23.440 --> 22:25.044
You think
because the windows are open

22:25.080 --> 22:26.560
that that's some sort
of a treat, huh?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.443
No, the dog's coming in.

22:28.520 --> 22:29.931
Respect.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.323
Yeah, baby.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.246
You said it.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.924
- Dean.
- Yep.

23:03.000 --> 23:03.967
So what else can you tell me

23:04.000 --> 23:05.280
about the man in the cowboy hat?

23:05.320 --> 23:07.482
Honestly, I couldn't see much.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.085
Damn cataracts.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.964
And, you know, no one's going
to pay for my surgery.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.685
Just another casualty
of the system, I guess.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.809
I don't belong here, you know.
I'm pedigreed.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.002
Well, I'm sure
you'll be out of here soon.

23:20.080 --> 23:22.481
Please. I'm 14.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.570
Good luck, ma'am.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.924
Once a day,
they clean these cages.

23:32.000 --> 23:32.922
Once a day.

23:33.000 --> 23:33.922
Okay.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.411
A biscuit.
Just one biscuit.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.686
I just see here,
this mess smells.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.923
I need a Raquel Welch poster
and a rock hammer.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.651
I'm shaking the fence, boss,
still shaking the fence.

23:42.880 --> 23:43.642
- Over here.
- I was framed.

23:43.680 --> 23:46.251
I'm shaking the fence, boss,
still shaking the fence.

23:46.360 --> 23:47.964
Any luck?

23:48.160 --> 23:49.366
Hardly.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.607
I'm not getting any clues,
just a bunch of complaints.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.648
Hey, pretty-boy.
Over here.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.251
Yeah, sorry, pal.
I'm done for the day.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.209
But I saw everything.

24:01.120 --> 24:05.330
And I'll tell ya,
but it'll cost ya.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.169
What, are you kidding me?

24:07.200 --> 24:08.964
I'm not being extorted by a dog.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.042
Well, what do you want, huh?

24:11.120 --> 24:13.168
What Beggin' Strips, Snausages?

24:13.200 --> 24:15.202
Bitch, please.

24:15.280 --> 24:18.363
I'm gonna rat someone out,
it's got to be worth my while.

24:18.400 --> 24:21.244
I want a belly rub.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.367
You...

24:24.120 --> 24:25.042
All right.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.690
Not from you, sweetie.

24:26.720 --> 24:29.041
From that big one.

24:29.080 --> 24:32.243
Over there. Hi.

24:32.320 --> 24:35.688
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Cowboy hat, leather pants,

24:35.720 --> 24:38.564
the dude's a total closet case.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.085
Okay, what else can you
tell me about the guy,

24:40.160 --> 24:41.241
other than his outfit?

24:41.320 --> 24:45.086
Um... he was carrying
a burlap sack for the cats.

24:45.120 --> 24:46.201
What does he want with the cats?

24:46.240 --> 24:47.765
Ooh, attaboy, yeah.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.008
Hell, if I know,
but he took all of 'em.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.759
- Except for the one he ate.
- Ohh!

24:52.760 --> 24:54.569
What?

24:54.640 --> 24:57.689
Apparently, our guy has
a sweet tooth for kitty cats.

24:57.720 --> 24:59.239
Oh.

24:59.240 --> 25:02.722
Oh, oh, and the sack had
something written on it.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.519
Okay, what did it say?

25:04.520 --> 25:05.885
Ohh...

25:07.400 --> 25:08.447
Hey, come on.
We had a deal.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.926
Well, you tell that
to the tall drink.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.724
He's the one
who stopped rubbing.

25:12.760 --> 25:13.761
Sam.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.683
- Hand cramps.
- He's not talking.

25:18.520 --> 25:19.407
Mm.

25:19.408 --> 25:21.323
Attaboy.

25:21.400 --> 25:24.051
It said "Avant-Garde Cuisine."

25:24.120 --> 25:27.408
Lucky for you, I read French.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.408
That's a cafe
on Main Street.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.920
"No dogs allowed."

25:31.960 --> 25:33.962
Well, no wonder he smelled
like hamburgers and dish soap.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.525
We got to go downtown.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.284
Apparently our guy works
at a restaurant.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.840
Whoa, yeah.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.126
No, no, wait, wait, wait, hey.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.043
Sure you don't want to adopt me?

25:43.120 --> 25:44.326
No, thanks, we'll pass.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.641
No, I'm not above licking feet.

25:46.680 --> 25:48.045
Hey, big 'un, come back here.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.645
All right.

25:49.720 --> 25:50.642
Hey, hold up.

25:50.720 --> 25:52.449
What's the matter?

25:52.480 --> 25:54.528
Best belly rub I ever had.

25:59.400 --> 26:03.086
Freedom!

26:03.160 --> 26:06.369
I left a surprise in there
for animal control.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.090
I didn't peg you for a softie.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.650
Going home, going home.

26:09.680 --> 26:10.761
Honey, I'm coming home.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.165
Yeah, I'm coming home.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.565
I'm going home.

26:13.640 --> 26:14.721
Bacon. Bacon. Bacon.

26:40.720 --> 26:41.720
I'm sorry.

26:41.760 --> 26:44.969
Who can afford to be closed
on Monday these days?

26:45.040 --> 26:46.724
- Homicidal maniac?
- Yeah.

26:47.720 --> 26:48.721
Hey.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.205
Check this out.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.287
Chef Leo.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.361
Think he's our guy?

27:09.720 --> 27:10.721
It's Okie town.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.410
Lots of dudes wear cowboy hats.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.487
Whoa!

27:23.520 --> 27:28.845
Oxycodone, Tramadol, methadone.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.087
Guess he likes to cook
comfortably numb.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.724
Yeah, apparently.

27:32.840 --> 27:33.840
Help us.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.729
- Please, mister.
- Over here.

27:35.760 --> 27:36.841
Did you hear that?

27:39.800 --> 27:41.211
It sounded like little kids.

27:43.760 --> 27:47.082
Help. If you don't
free us, the chef will eat us.

27:47.120 --> 27:50.090
- He's not lying.
- We're in a cage.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.087
Eat you?

27:56.120 --> 27:58.487
Look in the refrigerator
behind you.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.847
- Yeah, behind you.
- In the fridge.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.041
Hey.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.761
Owl brains,

28:08.800 --> 28:10.211
cheetah liver,

28:10.280 --> 28:11.691
grizzly heart.

28:11.760 --> 28:13.683
I found a spell book.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.125
Shamanism.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.925
Well, what's a chef doing
dabbling with witchcraft?

28:17.960 --> 28:20.281
It says here whatever
animal organ you ingest

28:20.360 --> 28:23.204
with the right mix of
hoodoo and spices,

28:23.280 --> 28:25.089
you temporarily gain the power
of that animal.

28:25.120 --> 28:29.409
So okay, if you're munching
on owl brains...

28:29.440 --> 28:30.930
Your head spins around like
The Exorcist?

28:30.960 --> 28:33.930
Close. Bolsters your IQ.

28:33.960 --> 28:37.442
Okay. Eat a cheetah liver
for speed,

28:37.480 --> 28:39.528
bear heart for strength.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.965
Okay, so if he's chowing down
on this stuff...

28:41.040 --> 28:41.962
Then it would make sense

28:42.040 --> 28:43.724
why he constricted
the taxidermist

28:43.800 --> 28:45.928
and clawed the guy
at the shelter.

28:45.960 --> 28:49.123
Well, no offense, but why would
he want to eat you guys?

28:49.160 --> 28:51.208
Uh, we have collapsible spines.

28:51.280 --> 28:52.202
We do. Promise.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.280
- Look at this.
- Hm.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.810
"Lion liver plus eagle heart.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.002
A rattlesnake fangs plus
anaconda bladder.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.686
Baboon brains plus
black widow abdomen."

28:59.760 --> 29:01.046
He's mixing ingredients.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.246
What the hell for?

29:04.720 --> 29:06.245
Shoo! Quiet.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.243
Don't shush me.
You be quiet.

29:08.320 --> 29:09.731
I'm as quiet as a mouse.

29:31.640 --> 29:32.562
Who the hell are you?

29:32.640 --> 29:34.210
We're from the health department.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.287
Stopped by for an inspection.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.681
I wasn't aware
we had one scheduled.

29:37.720 --> 29:41.042
Yeah, no, you wouldn't be.
That's the point.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.281
Besides, I thought
you were closed.

29:42.360 --> 29:44.488
We are.
Chef's having a private dinner.

29:44.520 --> 29:46.284
In fact, he'll be here
any minute.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.044
Oh. Well then,

29:48.120 --> 29:50.248
in that case,
kitchen's shut down.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.368
Shut down? Why?

29:52.400 --> 29:54.880
Because you're both
in clear violation

29:54.960 --> 29:56.371
of penal code 8.14.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.801
Out, come on, get out.

30:02.880 --> 30:03.881
Both of ya.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.410
We'll let ya know.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.482
All right.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.607
I'll take the front,
you take the back.

30:10.680 --> 30:12.125
We even know
how to kill this guy?

30:12.200 --> 30:14.567
Well, empty one of these
in his head.

30:14.640 --> 30:15.880
See what that does.

30:56.400 --> 30:59.085
Chameleons aren't that bad.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.326
Kind of taste like chicken.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.326
How the hell did you do that?

31:29.960 --> 31:30.882
Do what?

31:30.960 --> 31:33.850
Don't play coy.
I want to know what you are.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.927
Oh, screw the sharktopus.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.767
You're my main course.

32:02.160 --> 32:05.004
Why does it smell like
dog in here?

32:09.080 --> 32:11.287
That smell's coming from you.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.209
All dogs should be leashed.

32:38.800 --> 32:40.131
What did you do to my brother?

32:42.400 --> 32:43.845
Your brother?

32:45.640 --> 32:47.642
What was your mom smoking
when she had you two?

32:47.720 --> 32:48.687
He's fine.

32:48.720 --> 32:51.451
He's just taking
a little cat nap before dinner.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.045
I've never had
human heart before.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.485
Heard it's a bit chewy.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.925
Good job I'm not a fussy eater.

32:59.400 --> 33:00.561
You're sick.

33:01.560 --> 33:03.244
Been told that once or twice.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.561
No, no.
Not in the head.

33:05.640 --> 33:08.086
Well, you are that, too,

33:08.120 --> 33:11.442
but I mean sick like cancer.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.684
Well, I guess dogs really can
sniff it out.

33:18.760 --> 33:21.366
Stage IV carcinoma.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.089
So that's why you're doing this.

33:25.080 --> 33:26.241
What happened?

33:26.320 --> 33:29.802
Draw the short straw,
decided to break bad?

33:29.880 --> 33:31.211
See, when I was diagnosed,

33:31.240 --> 33:33.925
I was way past
standard treatment.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.530
No one could save me.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.001
But then with the help
of a Pawnee shaman

33:38.080 --> 33:40.970
and a zoo membership,
I found a cure.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.811
Albeit a temporary one.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.484
Cancer always came back.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.282
You start experimenting
with different organs, huh?

33:50.360 --> 33:53.250
Traded in the single serving
for a combo platter.

33:53.280 --> 33:56.921
Well, what can I say?
Combination therapy works.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.849
I felt stronger,

33:58.920 --> 34:02.641
and the effects lasted longer.

34:02.680 --> 34:06.480
And if you smoke a few innocent
people in the process,

34:06.520 --> 34:09.126
well, hell, at least you felt better.

34:09.159 --> 34:11.288
Well, I didn't mean to kill anyone,

34:12.400 --> 34:14.801
at first.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.645
But if people got in my way,
they became collateral damage.

34:19.960 --> 34:23.009
Guess you eat enough predators,
you start to become one.

34:25.159 --> 34:26.605
You are what you eat, right?

34:28.719 --> 34:29.760
You really think the power

34:29.800 --> 34:31.802
you hold over
other people's lives

34:31.920 --> 34:34.161
can make up for what you lack
in your own?

34:39.840 --> 34:43.083
So, dog boy,

34:43.159 --> 34:46.447
what do I need to eat
to take you down, huh?

34:52.239 --> 34:53.366
You don't want to do this.

34:53.440 --> 34:55.568
Oh, but I do want to do this.

34:57.920 --> 35:02.050
See, I'm gonna kill you,
work up a nice appetite.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.488
And then I'm gonna eat
your brother.

35:07.680 --> 35:10.206
I mean, I don't know
what the hell he is,

35:10.280 --> 35:15.207
but with healing powers
like that, who cares?

35:17.640 --> 35:19.085
He could cure me.

35:26.080 --> 35:30.369
Dog-on, sort of dog.

36:17.240 --> 36:21.165
Sorry. Wolf trumps dog.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.639
Maybe. But not a whole pack.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.930
Hey.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.167
For the love of God, Sammy!

37:08.200 --> 37:09.486
Hey, Sammy?

37:11.800 --> 37:13.962
Zeke?

37:14.000 --> 37:14.967
Whoever the hell you are.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.207
Hey. Come on.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.365
Don't make me lick
your damn face.

37:22.840 --> 37:23.841
Hey.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.081
Come on.

37:35.640 --> 37:36.971
When you called us
about adopting him,

37:37.000 --> 37:37.967
we couldn't believe it.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.650
Aren't you the sweetest?

37:39.680 --> 37:41.648
Back off, tofu-breath.

37:41.680 --> 37:44.365
Oh, you must be starving.

37:44.440 --> 37:47.842
Lucky for you, I baked
some vegan doggie cupcakes.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.405
Bah.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.251
I'm gonna be pooping wheatgrass
with these two.

37:57.840 --> 37:58.966
Look, I know they're hippie freaks,

37:59.040 --> 38:00.280
but they're gonna give you
a good home,

38:00.360 --> 38:01.282
one that you deserve.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.328
Yeah, yeah.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.041
Wish we could take you
on the road with us,

38:06.120 --> 38:08.805
but it's no life for a dog.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.804
Don't sweat it.
I get carsick anyway.

38:11.880 --> 38:13.723
I was afraid to tell you
earlier,

38:13.760 --> 38:15.000
but I barfed in your backseat.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.247
You...

38:18.240 --> 38:19.241
What?

38:23.040 --> 38:24.007
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.804
I'll miss you, too.

38:25.880 --> 38:28.565
And by the way,
as an honorary dog,

38:28.640 --> 38:30.244
there's something
you should know.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.567
Dog's aren't really
man's best friend.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.404
What are you talking about?

38:34.480 --> 38:36.721
I know it sounds
like a conspiracy theory,

38:36.760 --> 38:39.127
but the real reason
we were put here was to...

38:42.920 --> 38:43.967
Put here to do what?

38:47.160 --> 38:49.208
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.571
Oh, now the spell wears off?

38:57.080 --> 38:58.525
Okay.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.764
How did it go?

39:07.800 --> 39:12.362
Well, bad news is
I'm gonna miss the flea-bag.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.646
Good news is
it looks like the spell is

39:13.720 --> 39:14.801
finally wearing off.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.564
You Okay?

39:19.600 --> 39:21.443
Stetson-man got you pretty good.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.442
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.479
I just...

39:25.480 --> 39:27.289
Well, I can't stop thinking
about what he said.

39:27.320 --> 39:29.322
Oh, come on, Sammy.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.846
Guy was out of
his freaking gourd.

39:31.920 --> 39:35.322
Yeah, but, I mean, why...
Why would he ask that?

39:35.400 --> 39:37.209
Why... Why did he want to know
what I was?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.365
Who the hell knows?

39:40.480 --> 39:42.687
He was all jacked up
on juice, you know?

39:42.760 --> 39:43.841
He was possessed by...

39:43.920 --> 39:45.081
by something
he couldn't control.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.246
It was...

39:52.720 --> 39:54.370
You know, it was just a
matter of time

39:54.440 --> 39:55.680
before it completely took over.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.249
You can't reason
with crazy, right?

40:03.840 --> 40:04.840
I don't know.

40:04.880 --> 40:07.486
Well, I do.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.483
Trust me, Sam.
You got nothing to worry about.
