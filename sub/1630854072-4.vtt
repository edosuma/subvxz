02:15.426 --> 02:18.012
-<i>Any movement?</i>
-<i>Dead. Nothing in, nothing out.</i>

02:18.096 --> 02:19.347
<i>Motherfucker.</i>

02:19.430 --> 02:22.392
<i>Faraday had it right.</i>
<i>He swapped venues.</i>

02:22.475 --> 02:24.060
<i>Ah! Dropped the ball on this.</i>

02:24.144 --> 02:26.020
<i>Sorry. It's a lost cause by now.</i>

02:26.104 --> 02:29.524
Arasaka's cleaning a house
over a stolen stretch, it can't be, eh?

02:29.607 --> 02:33.111
Hmm. Taking your ride,
whole thing makes a highway shit.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.864
I wish Faraday tells us
what the fuck we're after.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.992
What's that thing,
"Biggest fish is the one that got away"?

02:39.075 --> 02:41.035
Should I dig deeper on Tanaka?

02:41.703 --> 02:44.747
No, sniffing around Arasaka's
business is a fixer's job.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.875
It's on him to give us a lead.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.877
Wouldn't ask too much to say,

02:48.960 --> 02:52.088
"I pay you to check the boxes
off my list."

02:52.172 --> 02:55.592
Sure, but…
curiosity is killing me.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.636
Let me see Kiwi on it.
See what she can find.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.055
It ain't going to stop you,
baby doll.

03:01.139 --> 03:05.560
Meantime, you and me, let's go to town.

03:17.488 --> 03:20.950
<i>Bad, bad time kid. Now's bad.</i>

03:21.034 --> 03:24.037
Uh the word. What's the word?
I hadn't heard anything.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.582
<i>Said I'd call if any giggly</i>
<i>popped up.</i>

03:27.665 --> 03:30.001
Nothing? Still nada?
Take whatever you got.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.086
<i>Desperate looks ugly, rookie.</i>

03:32.170 --> 03:35.298
<i>Ed's all gone? Blow your last cut already?</i>

03:35.381 --> 03:38.051
-Not Eddies. It's not what I mean.
-<i>Huh?</i>

03:38.134 --> 03:40.637
Learning, learning the ropes, me.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.056
You can't be my crutch.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.599
<i>Said yourself, right?</i>

03:45.725 --> 03:47.185
Right, fine.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.063
Hey! I'm looking for Aldo.

03:50.146 --> 03:52.690
Yeah? Who's looking now?

03:52.774 --> 03:54.734
Maine. He sent me.

03:54.817 --> 03:57.362
Ha? You Davis then?

03:57.445 --> 03:58.988
Uh…

03:59.072 --> 04:01.241
-Huh?
-I'm David.

04:01.324 --> 04:05.370
-Davis?
-It's David! Not Davis! David!

04:05.453 --> 04:08.748
What are you screaming for,
rude motherfucker?

04:08.831 --> 04:11.542
Got it. David. Heard you.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.670
You're Pilar's carrying pigeon, yeah?

04:13.753 --> 04:14.712
Pilar's?

04:15.546 --> 04:17.048
It was you, wasn't it?

04:17.131 --> 04:21.469
The punk kid who cleft and junked
Arasaka limo? Hell of an entrance.

04:21.552 --> 04:24.472
Yeah… my first real gig.

04:24.555 --> 04:27.725
Could have collected
five fat spots for it at least.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.019
if you hadn't gone and turned it to scrap.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.563
-Well, there's always next time.
-Ha?

04:32.647 --> 04:34.274
I'll do better next time!

04:36.401 --> 04:38.027
Next time, eh?

04:38.111 --> 04:42.031
Well, I guess, we'll see you if last time
wasn't just a beginner's luck.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.034
-What do you mean by that?
-Nothing personal.

04:45.118 --> 04:49.497
We'll find out soon if you're a shit
or just another shit's stain.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.583
Hear about that C-Psych
alone in Watson?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.419
They just keep popping up.

04:54.502 --> 04:57.213
Yeah, two men patrol
flat-lined just like that.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.383
Yeah. Saw the scroll, poor fuckers.

05:00.466 --> 05:01.676
A single launcher hit

05:01.759 --> 05:04.304
turned them both into canned easy-peasy.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.145
Hey, David, my man!

05:12.228 --> 05:15.481
-What's going on? Everything good?
-I am-- Uh, yeah!

05:15.565 --> 05:17.734
What's up, chum? You need something?

05:17.817 --> 05:19.027
Uh, yeah!

05:19.110 --> 05:21.946
Got this package here from Maine.
Is Pilar here?

05:22.030 --> 05:23.031
Ugh!

05:23.114 --> 05:24.365
Yo, bro, it's for you!

05:24.449 --> 05:25.867
-He's your brother?
-Ha?

05:25.950 --> 05:27.952
Maine sent you something. Come get it.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.538
Fucking finally!

05:31.247 --> 05:35.460
Wow! Is that the boy who'd killed
for a pair of cyberhands like this?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.628
Supreme!

05:37.712 --> 05:41.549
You want me to excuse you or..?

05:41.632 --> 05:43.843
Got anything else for me to do
or is that it?

05:43.926 --> 05:46.471
Bro, that's it for today?

05:46.554 --> 05:48.181
Yeah, fuck off!

05:48.264 --> 05:50.808
And, Becca, tip him on his way out.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.811
Fuck it up for yourself, cheap-ass!

05:53.895 --> 05:55.355
It's bulletproof!

05:55.438 --> 05:57.732
So is that everything? Do I clock out now?

05:57.815 --> 05:59.942
Uh… Yeah, whatever.
It looks that way to me.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.235
Uh, no, I guess.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.239
Whoa! That's a tip?

06:05.323 --> 06:07.742
Damn. You're fucking adorable.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.578
-Huh!
-See you soon, dimples.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.416
<i>Hey, are you free tonight?</i>

06:15.500 --> 06:16.834
Whoa!

06:24.217 --> 06:25.968
You showed up?

06:26.052 --> 06:28.513
You told me to come, so I did.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.723
Maine bullied me, so I had to.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.517
What? Maine did?

06:33.142 --> 06:34.936
<i>Why me?</i>

06:35.019 --> 06:38.106
<i>You're a stray. You ain't never</i>
<i>taken one in, a stray?</i>

06:38.189 --> 06:39.774
<i>Show some responsibility.</i>

06:39.857 --> 06:42.485
<i>He's yours. You said to keep him.</i>

06:42.568 --> 06:45.196
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Kid's been hounding me for work.</i>

06:45.279 --> 06:48.866
<i>Whine-yap-yap. Walk that doug.</i>
<i>Tucker him out.</i>

06:50.410 --> 06:51.744
Assmunch.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.287
Fuck that guy!

06:53.371 --> 06:55.706
I'll say, it's my day-off too.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.959
Sorry, you're stuck with me.

06:58.042 --> 07:02.755
No offense but, chopsticks, narrow
torso, not exactly built like a punk.

07:02.839 --> 07:07.427
With that frame, look prime to tweak out
after one, maybe two more implants.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.846
I ain't weak,
if that's what you're getting at.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.180
Keep up then.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.395
Ever use one?

07:18.312 --> 07:19.355
Nope.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.941
Gloria never let you carry?

07:22.024 --> 07:23.484
It's time, we change that.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.529
What do you say? I could teach you
some tricks if you want.

07:26.612 --> 07:30.491
Think. Sandevistan. I'll stick with that.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.891
-<i>Hey.</i>
-<i>Yeah?</i>

07:55.641 --> 07:58.311
I'm wondering. Are you a real netrunner?

07:58.394 --> 07:59.604
Clearly. And?

07:59.687 --> 08:03.024
Nothing. Just why would netrunners
have to, you know, run.

08:03.107 --> 08:07.236
Netter's edge. Runner's a runner.
Good stamina can take you far.

08:36.516 --> 08:40.102
<i>You don't fly your crip out cover</i>
<i>from now on. You fill me, doug?</i>

08:41.187 --> 08:44.941
Every single day you check, wallet,
cock sock in your damn iron.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.278
Sure, some punks strictly hack,
will go straight chrome.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.031
But it will be a while
before you can keep your ass alive

08:52.114 --> 08:53.783
using just cyberware.

08:54.534 --> 08:59.080
Until that time comes,
this piece will be your backup plan.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.838
-So, hey.
-What now?

09:07.922 --> 09:09.549
How old are you anyway?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.034
How're things going on with Lucy?

09:37.118 --> 09:38.119
Huh?

09:38.202 --> 09:39.287
Treating you right?

09:40.204 --> 09:43.207
Sorry. I didn't mean…
That cam out wrong.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.127
It's just, your age, your skills,
they don't add up.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.462
Blame Math were it ain't applicable.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.464
It's aptitude and hard work.

09:50.548 --> 09:54.218
So get that straight. Only gonks
talk on others based on age.

09:54.802 --> 09:55.678
Gonks like?

09:55.761 --> 09:57.638
Long-limb techies.

10:18.576 --> 10:19.869
Grr!

10:21.954 --> 10:24.290
<i>What do you mean by</i>
<i>"treating her right"?</i>

10:24.373 --> 10:27.209
Huh! It means
you haven't done nothing?

10:27.293 --> 10:29.086
What are we
talking about, exactly?

10:29.170 --> 10:32.840
David, my clueless junior.
You need a pro pair.

10:32.923 --> 10:36.886
And I think you know, I ain't just
talking about any edge right sense.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.350
<i>Really? Thought I saw</i>
<i>you two hitting it off the other day.</i>

10:43.309 --> 10:45.936
Back at the black party,
post limo heist.

10:46.020 --> 10:49.857
He acts like a mentor sometimes
then turns around, gets grabby.

10:49.940 --> 10:53.861
And that night, so I fried him slightly
fucked-off real quickly after that.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.865
-And you?
-Me?

10:58.449 --> 11:00.701
You serious about headrunning?

11:08.959 --> 11:11.003
<i>I'm not into her like that.</i>

11:11.087 --> 11:13.506
Come on kid, we've all got eyes.

11:13.589 --> 11:17.635
Or, at least she's isn't
into me like that.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.387
Yeah, probably.

11:29.605 --> 11:30.731
Why do you ask?

11:30.815 --> 11:33.442
To be honest, just don't strike me
that type.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.027
What is that mean?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.362
Tell me!

11:48.499 --> 11:51.043
<i>I'm sick of trying</i>
<i>to figure it out, you know.</i>

11:52.169 --> 11:53.671
Meaning, what man?

11:53.754 --> 11:55.631
Said she wants to go to the moon.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.007
The damn moon?

11:57.091 --> 11:59.343
Yeah. I guess it's her dream or whatever.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.914
Turned out, you're a lot faster
than you look.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.666
Yeah, yeah.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.753
No, seriously.
Glad you could keep up with me.

12:33.836 --> 12:37.506
If that's suppose to be a pep talk,
no need. I don't go down, easy.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.506
<i>Never mentioned</i>
<i>nothing about that to me.</i>

13:19.340 --> 13:20.591
You're thinking she lied?

13:20.674 --> 13:23.010
Who knows? Just ask her.

13:23.093 --> 13:27.681
I mean, she was probably
just stalling me, but…

13:27.765 --> 13:32.228
Well, she took me to the moon,
with special BD she had.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.104
You two went on a date
to the moon?

13:34.188 --> 13:38.609
Shit, doug! You don't get much more
romantic than that in Night City.

13:47.743 --> 13:49.495
<i>Here, a training regimen.</i>

13:50.329 --> 13:54.375
The bare minimum you should know.
No more hand holding after today.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.879
If you're serious about this, you're going
to push hard to keep up. And then…

13:59.713 --> 14:00.965
And then, what?

14:21.569 --> 14:23.904
<i>How long has she been running</i>
<i>for your crew?</i>

14:25.072 --> 14:28.784
Uh, maybe a year.
Kiwi brought her in.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.037
Said she'd found a natural,
real cold feet.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.080
And before that?

14:33.163 --> 14:36.876
Like I said, ask her yourself
if you're interested, kid.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.420
I don't give two shits
about people's past.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.548
As long as they pull their weight
on the job, we're good.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.550
That suits me just fine.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.491
Hey! Quiet down!

15:11.118 --> 15:13.245
Damn it!

15:15.247 --> 15:16.874
Why he's pissing up there?

15:16.957 --> 15:18.876
-Oh, mute!
-Gross!

15:18.959 --> 15:23.130
Uh! What's your problem, Chume?
Why are you pissing in the street, huh?

15:23.714 --> 15:25.883
Hey, man! Playing dumb?

15:25.966 --> 15:27.468
Leave him alone, Pilar.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.887
-Bye. Bye, bro.
-You got to show us your stroke?

15:30.971 --> 15:33.766
You hard in hearing, chuva?
I'm talking to you.

15:33.849 --> 15:37.353
Listen up. This isn't your water
in turf, asshole.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.772
And guess what,
we don't like pestering pissed.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.815
Are we clear on that?

15:41.899 --> 15:44.777
Now be a good asshole and pinch it off
and keep that pecker so we could…

15:44.860 --> 15:47.279
Oh, shit man! That's fucking plastic.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.657
You chromed your dick? That hurts.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.952
Kicks me to the face. Hard as…

16:11.971 --> 16:13.389
Hey…

16:17.726 --> 16:22.398
Da… vid…

16:24.483 --> 16:26.276
move…

16:49.591 --> 16:51.427
Don't you freeze on me now!

16:51.510 --> 16:52.511
Fucking captive!

16:52.594 --> 16:54.388
-Enough Pilar on me…
-Give me that!

16:54.972 --> 16:57.057
Fucker!

16:57.141 --> 17:01.770
You had no fucking right!
You fucking cyber psycho.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.735
Crazy, little shit. Your flat now
if you won't subtle.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.528
Let me go!

17:10.738 --> 17:13.115
Hi-yah! Die!

17:17.828 --> 17:19.997
Shit, of all times…

17:20.080 --> 17:22.041
Kiwi! Press Becca's lullaby!

17:22.124 --> 17:23.959
On it.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.297
Where's Lucy?!

17:39.683 --> 17:41.518
Hey, asshole!

17:43.604 --> 17:44.897
David, no!

18:02.122 --> 18:03.040
You, okay?

18:03.123 --> 18:05.709
I'm fine.

18:06.668 --> 18:08.045
Alright. It's now over.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.048
You're bleeding…

18:18.138 --> 18:19.556
I'm the only bitch

18:19.640 --> 18:22.601
what's mine to kill.
You took that from me.

18:27.564 --> 18:28.982
Don't touch me.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.943
You're hurt? Need a booster?

18:31.026 --> 18:32.111
No. I'm good.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.614
Dorio, go and see Ripper. You should
take her to our buddy.

18:35.697 --> 18:39.910
Kiwi and I now hang back here, take care
of things 'till the pigs show to clean up.

18:39.993 --> 18:43.372
He's a pain in the ass, but someone
has to explain this cluster fuck.

18:43.455 --> 18:46.375
-Boss man has spoken.
-Hmm.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.920
-You too, kid. Stick with Lucy and Dorio.
-Huh?

18:50.003 --> 18:52.464
We'll tell the badges exactly
what went down.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.092
Fuck is chromed up to wazoo.
It will be easy.

18:55.175 --> 18:58.512
Minimal questions though filed
on this cyber psycho incident and done.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.390
-Yeah, but…
-I saw what you did back there, doug.

19:01.473 --> 19:04.017
It's hight time,
you stop thinking like a rookie.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.813
Not you again!

19:07.896 --> 19:10.399
You know, I'm not a licensed physician.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.569
It doesn't matter. It's like I volunteered
to come here.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.195
Sure. Whatever.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.322
I'm going alone.

19:17.406 --> 19:21.160
Make sure, you get her home
when she's clean, alright.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.495
-What! You're leaving.
-Maine said you could take his wheels.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.045
Uh! Hey! Lucy.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.266
-Here's fine.
-Okay.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.768
-Good night.
-Um…

19:47.644 --> 19:50.439
Can we talk?

19:55.360 --> 19:56.195
This way.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.118
Aw. Cloudy tonight.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.329
Remember that moon BD we did?

20:05.412 --> 20:07.581
That was fun.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.380
I had something
I wanted to talk about, too.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.298
Huh?

20:16.381 --> 20:19.718
I know how it must look,
but, it's true

20:19.801 --> 20:21.637
what I said then.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.264
It was actually the first time
I told anyone.

20:24.348 --> 20:27.601
Well, that's good. I like that.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.811
You know, the idea that you weren't lying.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.064
What if I'm lying now?

20:32.147 --> 20:34.316
-I seriously doubt it.
-Why not?

20:34.399 --> 20:37.069
-I just don't see it.
-Crazy.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.696
You should've said something earlier
and spilled it right away.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.448
I couldn't.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.449
What stopped you?

20:42.532 --> 20:44.701
You were so mad at me.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.078
I was not!

20:46.161 --> 20:48.080
Or too.

20:48.163 --> 20:52.334
I wasn't pissed off or anything.
It's just…

20:52.417 --> 20:53.585
-Well, yeah. I guess I kind of was
-See what I mean?

20:53.669 --> 20:57.589
So, okay. Maybe, I was angry,
but… it ain't like I'm holding a grudge.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.843
I wouldn't have jumped
that raging psycho if I wasn't.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.595
-Liar.
-I'm serious.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.721
No, you would have.

21:04.805 --> 21:08.350
You're the guy who jumps
in fire to rescue someone,

21:08.433 --> 21:12.145
anyone, even you know,
you're going to get burned.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.689
Just that type.

21:14.564 --> 21:17.359
Are we back to the you know mark thing?

21:17.442 --> 21:19.403
Maine thinks I got what it takes.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.072
-Why is it that you don't…
-No, it's not that.

21:22.155 --> 21:25.534
I know you'd make a good edgerunner.

21:25.617 --> 21:27.661
You already are, I think.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.204
So what's the problem?

21:29.288 --> 21:33.000
Don't make a name for yourself
as a cyberpunk by how you live…

21:33.583 --> 21:35.711
Make a name by how you die.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.132
It's not the life or the end you deserve.

21:40.215 --> 21:43.427
Was that even me?
How am I different from you?

21:43.510 --> 21:46.179
I've got nowhere else to go. This is it.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.431
And we're exactly the same.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.017
-You and I are worlds apart.
-In what way?

21:54.104 --> 21:56.273
I'm going to take you there myself,
fly you to the moon.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.568
That's a promise!

22:09.619 --> 22:11.538
I don't want you to die on me.

22:29.973 --> 22:30.849
I won't.
