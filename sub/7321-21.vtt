00:08.808 --> 00:11.140
- Chicken!
- Good chicken.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.337
It's chicken.

00:12.379 --> 00:15.314
I know it's chicken.
I want to know what it tastes like.

00:15.348 --> 00:16.372
Tastes like chicken.

00:16.950 --> 00:20.283
- I'm having surgery today.
- Maybe. If the mets have shrunk.

00:20.320 --> 00:24.347
I am maybe having surgery and as such
I cannot taste the chicken for myself.

00:24.391 --> 00:27.121
So I really need you guys
to tell me what it tastes like.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.561
I need to announce it on Meredith
and Derek's wedding website.

00:30.597 --> 00:33.065
- There's a website?
- Can you please be more articulate

00:33.099 --> 00:34.657
than just "chicken?"

00:34.701 --> 00:38.000
Yay! Oh!

00:38.038 --> 00:40.063
That's the one!

00:40.106 --> 00:42.097
Very dapper, Dr. Shepherd.

00:42.142 --> 00:45.111
You're serious about this?
It's not some cruel joke?

00:45.145 --> 00:47.909
And you look fantastic.
He looks fantastic, right?

00:47.981 --> 00:49.039
- Yeah.
- Whatever.

00:50.450 --> 00:53.351
<i>Remember when we were little</i>
<i>and we'd accidentally</i>

00:53.386 --> 00:55.513
<i>bite a kid on the playground?</i>

00:55.555 --> 00:57.250
- Good luck.
- Good chicken.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.718
So?

00:59.759 --> 01:00.885
Pork!

01:01.828 --> 01:04.763
<i>Our teachers would go,</i>
<i>"Say you're sorry."</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:08.132
Oh!
Fine, I'll taste the chicken.

01:08.701 --> 01:10.999
<i>We would say it,</i>
<i>but we wouldn't mean it.</i>

01:12.472 --> 01:15.669
<i>Because the stupid kid we bit...</i>
<i>totally deserved it.</i>

01:15.708 --> 01:17.335
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:19.112 --> 01:21.637
Take care now.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.478
Hey. So, I can't afford rent.

01:23.516 --> 01:26.542
- Owen just told me to "Take care now."
- Nice. Three words.

01:26.586 --> 01:28.645
More than she's getting
from any of her family.

01:28.688 --> 01:31.851
My mom, silent.
My aunts, silent. My sister Aria?

01:31.891 --> 01:35.952
I know, I know how much power
my father wields. But seriously?

01:36.029 --> 01:38.896
What am I, invisible?
Dead to them? To my mother?

01:38.932 --> 01:40.422
You just have to give them time.

01:40.500 --> 01:44.596
Why can't you just tell them you
broke up? It's no one's business, right?

01:45.338 --> 01:47.033
And I will leave you to ponder that.

01:48.041 --> 01:52.341
<i>But as we get older,</i>
<i>making amends isn't so simple.</i>

01:52.378 --> 01:54.972
- You really think I should lie?
- I think you should pay rent.

01:55.014 --> 01:57.847
But, you know, whatever. Take care now.

01:57.884 --> 02:01.285
<i>After the playground days</i>
<i>are over, you can't just say it.</i>

02:01.321 --> 02:03.653
- <i>You have to mean it.</i>
- I got you a present.

02:03.690 --> 02:06.921
You can't give me money.
Even if you are a fancy plastic surgeon.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.555
I'm not your charity case. Not your
mistress. I am your friend. Your equal.

02:10.597 --> 02:11.962
It's not money.

02:11.998 --> 02:15.434
Really? I was just doing
the "poor but proud" thing for show.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.301
Better than money. Wait.

02:18.338 --> 02:22.866
<i>Of course, when you become</i>
<i>a doctor, "sorry" is not a happy word.</i>

02:22.909 --> 02:25.275
<i>It either means,</i>
<i>"You're dying and I can't help"...</i>

02:25.311 --> 02:28.337
She fell out of a tree
and broke all her limbs.

02:28.381 --> 02:31.248
Ooh! That is better.

02:31.284 --> 02:34.048
<i>...or it means,</i>
<i>"This is really gonna hurt."</i>

02:36.389 --> 02:37.515
How many days?

02:37.557 --> 02:40.651
- Twenty-nine.
- Fresh from rehab?

02:40.994 --> 02:43.258
I could tell you some
good meetings in the area.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.423
Thanks, they gave me a whole list.

02:47.400 --> 02:51.029
One more thing we have in common.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.500
Have you... talked to Meredith?

02:59.279 --> 03:00.610
To Lexie?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.387
Ow!

03:11.191 --> 03:14.627
OK, Willow, I'm afraid
your cheekbone looks broken, too.

03:14.661 --> 03:18.290
I'll need to wait a few weeks until
the swelling goes down to repair that.

03:18.331 --> 03:20.697
In a few weeks,
I'm gonna be up a tree in Utah.

03:21.134 --> 03:25.798
Those corporate bastards, the same ones
who just bulldozed me out of Kaili?

03:26.239 --> 03:30.039
They wanna clear-cut acres
to build another ski condo complex.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.100
Sons of bitches.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.079
There is so much
about that sentence I do not understand.

03:34.681 --> 03:37.548
You were "bulldozed" out of something?

03:38.017 --> 03:42.579
Kaili. She was the tree that
I was living in for the past six weeks.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.888
She was a beautiful 200-year-old oak

03:45.959 --> 03:49.224
in a grove full of
beautiful 200-year-old oaks.

03:49.262 --> 03:51.526
You named a tree "Kaili?"

03:51.598 --> 03:55.728
Kaili is Hawaiian for
"divine beauty and wisdom."

03:55.768 --> 03:58.430
And she was
all of those things.

03:58.471 --> 04:01.804
She was all of those things
and now she's gone.

04:02.375 --> 04:05.867
They're all gone.
And for what? Yuppie housing?

04:05.945 --> 04:07.674
Those corporate bastards.

04:07.714 --> 04:12.310
I'm sorry, but you're not gonna
be climbing any trees for a long while.

04:12.352 --> 04:14.411
How does one exactly live in a tree?

04:14.454 --> 04:18.048
I mean, how exactly does one,
say, eliminate waste?

04:18.091 --> 04:22.755
He's asking where your poo goes, which
may not be the most sensitive question

04:22.795 --> 04:25.161
while she's mourning the death of her...

04:25.465 --> 04:26.898
...tree friend.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.504
Excuse me, doctor?

04:38.845 --> 04:41.780
Oh! Excuse me, young and yummy doctor.

04:41.814 --> 04:44.612
- Can I help you?
- I don't know, can you?

04:45.451 --> 04:47.851
Are you looking for someone, ma'am?

04:47.887 --> 04:50.481
Oh, gosh, I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just call me ma'am,

04:50.523 --> 04:53.287
because I have this image
of you and me in my head playing doctor

04:53.326 --> 04:55.419
and that just kinda ruined it.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.897
OK. I'm gonna go back to work now.
But good luck with... whatever.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.328
Well I am looking for a doctor.

05:01.901 --> 05:05.462
Gosh, I guess she's a patient now.
Isobel Stevens?

05:05.505 --> 05:06.699
I'm, uh...

05:07.507 --> 05:09.031
I'm an old friend.

05:10.376 --> 05:13.174
- After you.
- Oh, a doctor and a gentleman.

05:13.212 --> 05:16.443
Now, that's a double yummy.
Oh, my God, who's getting married?

05:16.482 --> 05:19.383
Oh, my God. Mom.
What are you doing here?

05:19.419 --> 05:20.716
Mom?

05:20.753 --> 05:23.813
Shh! Cricket, you don't want
that hot doctor to think I'm old.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.856
Hey. You got paged, too?

05:33.900 --> 05:35.868
Yeah.
"Report to the chief's office, stat."

05:35.902 --> 05:38.496
What do you think? Why?
Why would he page us stat?

05:38.538 --> 05:41.006
I don't know. We kill anyone lately
and don't remember?

05:48.681 --> 05:49.909
Your father's here.

05:50.450 --> 05:54.147
He's 29 days sober,
just out of rehab.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.917
He's taking it seriously.
He's working his steps.

05:57.323 --> 06:00.486
The ninth step
is to make amends wherever possible.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.426
It's the key to an alcoholic's recovery.

06:02.462 --> 06:05.454
To take responsibility
for the wreckage of his past.

06:06.332 --> 06:09.995
I paged you here
to ask you to please hear him out.

06:10.036 --> 06:14.632
As a favor to me,
to please hear him out.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.876
- Uh, I'm covering the pit, chief...
- I'll cover it.

06:19.912 --> 06:22.073
- But there's a trauma...
- I've got it, Meredith.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.516
Please.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.414
Please.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.236
What are you doing?

06:47.273 --> 06:49.605
The chief asked me
to cover Mer in the pit.

06:49.642 --> 06:52.736
- I'm on Hunt's service all month.
- O'Malley! Hey there, now.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.636
O'Malley, update me.

06:54.680 --> 06:59.447
Two ambulances. Three patients,
one critical. Multiple gunshot wounds.

06:59.485 --> 07:05.219
Mike Carlson, 35, multiple GSWs. Last
BP, 88 systolic after two boluses of LR.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.282
Where was he shot?

07:06.325 --> 07:08.384
Chest, abdomen, back, legs, shoulder...

07:08.428 --> 07:10.623
- Someone meant business.
- Not so sure about that.

07:10.663 --> 07:13.188
She didn't mean it,
it was an accident. She really didn't.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.496
She's sorry.
Maddy, tell them you're sorry.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.230
She's the shooter?

07:17.637 --> 07:19.400
Somebody page the chief.

07:24.544 --> 07:27.570
- Breath sounds are better.
- Three to the thoracoabdominal area.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.639
- What's that brings the count to?
- Three plus seven to the legs...

07:30.683 --> 07:31.707
Two on the side.

07:31.751 --> 07:33.946
Could be through.
Put a swab through, see where it goes.

07:33.986 --> 07:36.181
- Do we roll him now?
- Finish his catheter.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.315
- Does it enter and exit?
- Hold on.

07:38.357 --> 07:39.483
Yeah, that makes 11.

07:39.525 --> 07:42.688
- What can we infer from these?
- Blood in the urine. Guessing kidney.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.929
O'Malley, let's roll him. On your count.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.898
One, two, three.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.497
- Yeah, more wounds here.
- Yang, page Shepherd.

07:50.570 --> 07:53.733
Let's get an accurate count
while we have him positioned.

07:54.707 --> 07:57.972
Maddy, how's this feel?
Does it hurt when I do this?

07:58.311 --> 07:59.335
Good.

07:59.378 --> 08:04.213
What about this cut? Can you tell me
how you got this big cut on your face?

08:04.250 --> 08:05.615
She's scared.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.142
Scared she did a bad thing and
you're gonna take her away.

08:08.187 --> 08:11.918
The police will want to talk to both of
you about how Maddy got the gun.

08:11.958 --> 08:14.392
We called social services
and they'll be here soon.

08:14.427 --> 08:17.191
They'll give you the support you need
to come back from this.

08:17.230 --> 08:21.496
And nobody's gonna take you
away from your mom, OK, Maddy?

08:22.101 --> 08:25.161
It hit her in the face.
The gun, the kickback.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.705
Huh...

08:27.740 --> 08:30.504
- 'Cause this doesn't look like...
- That's how she got the cut.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.845
Her daddy shoots targets
in the backyard.

08:33.913 --> 08:37.371
He put the gun down for a minute.
It was really stupid.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.748
She never meant to hurt him.

08:39.784 --> 08:42.845
OK. You'll tell the police that
and it'll be OK.

08:43.789 --> 08:44.881
Everything'll be OK.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.520
And I'm so deeply sorry...

08:53.099 --> 08:57.126
...for every time that I ever
hurt you or disappointed you,

08:57.169 --> 08:58.932
or let you down.

09:04.677 --> 09:08.636
I don't deserve your forgiveness,
but I hope...

09:08.681 --> 09:14.119
I so hope that you'll give me
the opportunity to earn it.

09:29.101 --> 09:32.696
Thank you. Congratulations on...

09:33.239 --> 09:34.672
You seem well.

09:36.542 --> 09:37.736
Good luck.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.758
And you remember Jade, from 114? Well...

09:58.831 --> 10:01.629
She had a spot of cancer last year.
It was breast cancer.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.192
That was such a shame, I thought.
She had such a great rack.

10:04.236 --> 10:06.568
Remember what a great rack she had?

10:06.606 --> 10:10.167
You used to do all those exercises
to try to get yours to grow like hers.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.234
Anyway.

10:12.278 --> 10:17.375
My point is, Jade, she had 'em cut off.
Both, just to be on the safe side.

10:17.416 --> 10:19.611
They look even better now. For real.

10:19.652 --> 10:23.679
Life gave her lemons and
she made cantaloupes!

10:23.723 --> 10:28.057
So, maybe, honey, there's an upside
in this for you, too. Right?

10:28.094 --> 10:31.962
Um... Mom. Just, uh, just listen, OK?

10:31.998 --> 10:34.592
I... I don't have breast cancer.

10:38.537 --> 10:42.837
OK. I have skin cancer,
or what started out as skin cancer...

10:42.875 --> 10:44.502
Hang on. Skin cancer?

10:45.811 --> 10:50.077
Oh, God, Isobel Stevens, oh,
you scared the hell out of me.

10:50.116 --> 10:54.553
And you made me come all the way up
here to Seattle for some ugly old mole?

10:54.587 --> 10:56.748
- Sweetheart.
- No, I didn't.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.485
I didn't make you come up here. I, uh...

10:59.525 --> 11:03.894
I didn't even call you. I'm really...
I'm curious. Who did? Who called?

11:04.997 --> 11:06.055
Who called her?

11:06.966 --> 11:10.197
Seriously. Who called her?

11:15.241 --> 11:17.539
You OK? Are you crying?

11:17.576 --> 11:19.544
- My dad's here.
- OK...

11:19.578 --> 11:23.514
He's here and he's sober,
and I'd really like for you to meet him.

11:23.549 --> 11:24.743
Oh...

11:25.084 --> 11:26.312
Oh.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.254
Umm... Oh.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.722
How about dinner tonight?
Camparo's at 8?

11:31.757 --> 11:33.224
Lexie, uh...

11:34.427 --> 11:37.123
...dads historically do not love me.

11:37.163 --> 11:41.463
And by that, I mean that
when I was a teenager...

11:42.935 --> 11:44.835
...dads did not love me,

11:44.870 --> 11:47.896
and then that's the last time
I had to meet anyone's dad.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.874
I'm crazy about you.

11:50.109 --> 11:53.601
I know that my dad will be, too.
You have nothing to worry about.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.705
That's what you said
when you told me to tell Derek.

11:55.748 --> 11:59.548
Lexie, I'm closer
to your dad's age than yours.

11:59.585 --> 12:03.681
So I'm thinking
he may not love me so much.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.385
You know, what we have is fantastic.

12:06.425 --> 12:09.724
Why don't we just keep it for us?

12:09.762 --> 12:12.094
Excuse me, I'm looking for my sister,
Karen Zelmann?

12:12.131 --> 12:14.122
We have a Willow Zelmann in there.

12:14.166 --> 12:17.135
- Her name is Karen.
- My name is Willow!

12:17.803 --> 12:23.036
I told you this would happen. I
told you to come out of the damn tree.

12:24.777 --> 12:27.974
How'd it go?

12:28.013 --> 12:32.245
Dr. Grey, Maddy could use a little
cleaning and repair. I'm being paged.

12:32.284 --> 12:35.378
- Absolutely.
- Meredith.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.787
- You OK?
- I'm great.

12:40.659 --> 12:42.092
Thanks.

12:43.362 --> 12:46.092
Hey, Maddy, I'm Dr. Grey.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.225
Mind if I take a look
at that cut on your face?

12:48.267 --> 12:51.202
She's so sorry. She's so sorry.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.436
Is my daddy gonna die?

12:57.109 --> 13:00.272
I don't know. I hope not.

13:00.312 --> 13:03.577
- Five bullets still inside.
- How many gunshots total?

13:03.649 --> 13:07.016
Twenty-five wounds total, five are
lodged inside, two graze wounds,

13:07.052 --> 13:08.849
nine through and through, so about 17.

13:08.888 --> 13:12.289
Seventeen? Thought this was
an accidental shooting.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.157
- How come?
- How come what?

13:16.228 --> 13:20.597
How come he don't die?
I shot him lots of times.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.434
How come he don't die?

13:34.079 --> 13:36.912
She's just a little girl,
a baby.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.542
She wasn't really trying to kill him,
she was...

13:40.586 --> 13:43.077
She doesn't even understand
what that means.

13:43.122 --> 13:46.182
She was just trying to stop him,
she was only trying to stop him.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.420
So that cut on her face
didn't come from the gun?

13:49.094 --> 13:50.425
He was hitting her.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.124
He loves us.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.960
Daddy loves us, Maddy.
Sometimes he just gets mad.

13:56.001 --> 14:00.461
And he's been working on it.
He's been working on it so hard.

14:00.906 --> 14:03.136
But she was just
trying to stop him.

14:03.175 --> 14:04.972
She wasn't trying to kill him.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.671
Please understand.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.913
She's just a little girl.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.180
Uh-huh. Oh. Really?

14:18.224 --> 14:21.660
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Really?

14:21.694 --> 14:25.858
Oh... Yeah, that's great, that's great.
Oh, thank you.

14:25.898 --> 14:29.129
Yeah, thank you, hon.
Thanks a million. Oh!

14:29.501 --> 14:31.867
Oh, that's great news, Cricket!

14:32.438 --> 14:34.463
You're gonna be just fine!

14:34.506 --> 14:36.337
Oh, yeah?

14:36.375 --> 14:40.277
Let me guess.
Your psychic told you that?

14:40.312 --> 14:43.372
It's not just any old psychic.
He's the best that I've ever heard of.

14:44.049 --> 14:48.349
Anyway, he said that skin cancer
is highly curable if caught early.

14:48.387 --> 14:51.948
Oh, that's so great.
A psychic with Internet access.

14:52.291 --> 14:56.660
Let me guess how much that call
cost you, mother. $19.99 a minute?

14:56.695 --> 14:58.526
When you have a sick child, Cricket,

14:58.564 --> 15:00.691
money's not really
the first thing on your mind.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.958
You seem like a
very capable doctor, Dr. Bailey.

15:04.236 --> 15:08.172
Can I trust that you caught
my daughter's skin cancer early?

15:09.141 --> 15:13.737
- Um, well, Mrs. Stevens...
- Oh, no. Call me Robbie, hon.

15:13.779 --> 15:17.715
No, Mom, don't call her "hon."
Don't call Bailey "hon."

15:17.750 --> 15:21.242
You know, if you have questions,
you can just ask me.

15:21.287 --> 15:26.520
She's very busy and this thing I have...
It's complicated, so...

15:26.558 --> 15:30.085
I know it's complicated, Isobel.
I'm not a complete idiot.

15:30.129 --> 15:33.098
Now, I saw this thing on Tyra's show...

15:33.132 --> 15:35.794
There was this woman
who had a mole on her private parts.

15:35.834 --> 15:38.359
The dermatologist did not check

15:38.404 --> 15:41.737
'cause she thought the gynie would've
done it. The gynie didn't do it...

15:41.774 --> 15:44.800
Maybe she didn't even go to the gynie...
Anyway, it was bad.

15:44.843 --> 15:47.334
She was bald and everything.

15:47.379 --> 15:51.042
She did not have a mole
on her private parts, did she?

15:51.083 --> 15:54.917
No, ma'am. No, she did not.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.444
Good.

15:59.325 --> 16:02.351
We need to take him in now.
GSWs to the abdomen, hematuria,

16:02.394 --> 16:05.955
vital signs are unstable.
Ma'am, he has major internal injuries.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.829
We're rushing him to surgery now.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.199
Wait! Maddy needs to tell her daddy
she's sorry before he goes.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.636
Baby, you need to tell your daddy
you're sorry.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.663
Maddy, people die in surgery.

16:15.741 --> 16:18.972
You don't want your daddy to die
without telling him how sorry you are.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.510
Come on, let's go tell him we love him.

16:22.748 --> 16:25.182
- You know? No. No.
- What?

16:25.217 --> 16:26.809
Maddy, stay right here, OK?

16:27.286 --> 16:28.514
- Dr. Grey...
- No.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.613
She will not go apologize to him.

16:30.656 --> 16:34.285
You should be apologizing to her.
I understand you're a victim,

16:34.326 --> 16:37.295
but there's no room for you to be
when your six-year-old is on the line.

16:37.329 --> 16:41.561
She's stronger than you.
Your six-year-old is stronger than you.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.433
At least she did something.
She stood up for the two of you,

16:44.470 --> 16:46.404
which is more than you did for her.

16:46.438 --> 16:48.372
No, she won't apologize to him.

16:54.246 --> 16:57.010
Thank you so much.
All right, I'll call you back.

16:57.049 --> 16:58.778
Listen, I have great news.

16:58.817 --> 17:01.115
I have a contact
at Schuster and Werner.

17:01.153 --> 17:03.018
More like Dirtbag and Felon.

17:03.055 --> 17:06.650
They've agreed to pay your medical bills
and to not sue you for trespassing

17:06.692 --> 17:09.422
if you sign a contract
saying you won't sue them

17:09.461 --> 17:11.929
and you won't trespass
on their properties ever again.

17:11.964 --> 17:16.195
Do you know how many acres of forest
they have single-handedly destroyed?

17:16.234 --> 17:19.568
How many ecosystems
will never be restored?

17:19.605 --> 17:22.574
The bees are dying, Julie.
The temperature is rising!

17:22.608 --> 17:25.599
I'm sorry. Is it possible I could
have a moment alone with my sister?

17:32.484 --> 17:35.749
- You'll sign this deal, Karen.
- My name is Willow!

17:35.788 --> 17:38.518
Can't say I'm sorry
I never had siblings.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.219
- They're yelling 'cause they care.
- That how it works?

17:41.260 --> 17:44.957
Yeah, it is, in some families. It is.

17:45.464 --> 17:49.525
I expected them to yell, you know?
I didn't expect silence.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.401
Call them and claim temporary insanity.

17:52.438 --> 17:55.498
You don't have to end it with
Roller-girl. Just say you did.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.008
Yang said the same thing.

17:57.042 --> 17:59.442
That's because
it's none of their business.

17:59.478 --> 18:02.174
There's no reason
you should have to hurt this much.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.458
I can see that you're angry with me,

18:15.727 --> 18:17.820
and maybe angry with your mother...

18:17.863 --> 18:21.799
Don't do that. I'm not your friend,
and I'm not your family.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.894
You don't get to call me into your
office on personal business,

18:24.937 --> 18:27.371
and you don't get to
speak to me this way right now.

18:27.406 --> 18:30.603
It's an abuse of power.
I'm a resident. I work for you.

18:30.676 --> 18:34.112
You have to speak to me
like I'm a resident. And for the record?

18:34.146 --> 18:38.242
Someone had to stand up for that girl.
I make no apologies for that.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.383
You want to just be a resident?

18:43.255 --> 18:46.782
Fine. All right then.

18:47.926 --> 18:52.488
That woman is a victim
of domestic violence.

18:52.564 --> 18:56.500
This hospital is supposed to be a safe
place for her to come tell her story.

18:56.535 --> 18:59.629
As her doctors,
it is our job to help her.

18:59.705 --> 19:01.570
You did not do your job.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.973
You further battered a battered woman.

19:04.042 --> 19:06.306
- What about...
- Dr. Grey!

19:06.378 --> 19:08.403
You will stay away from that child.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.438
You will stay away from that family.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.212
You will not come
within 100 feet of them.

19:13.252 --> 19:16.744
If you do, you will be
suspended from this hospital,

19:16.788 --> 19:21.555
pending re-evaluation of your emotional
and mental fitness for residency.

19:31.837 --> 19:35.637
The IVC and the aorta are nicked.
O'Malley, get in there with some clips.

19:35.707 --> 19:38.870
Gonna need the angled vascular clamp.

19:38.911 --> 19:42.142
Nothing's stopping. Still bleeding out.

19:42.181 --> 19:45.548
Don't move, Yang!
Need some more suction in there.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.984
- I know Webber is your friend.
- Not about Richard.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.784
It is. It is about him.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.053
I have to deal with him
on a professional basis every day.

19:54.092 --> 19:57.687
I've tried to draw a line with him
and he won't respect it.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.788
He uses his relationship with you...

19:59.865 --> 20:01.890
- Richard doesn't...
- Stop defending him.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.402
Be on my side.
I need you to be on my side.

20:04.436 --> 20:05.994
- OK.
- He's not your best friend.

20:06.071 --> 20:09.404
He's not your Cristina.
Which is why I feel OK to say to you

20:09.441 --> 20:12.069
he is not invited to our wedding.
I swear, Derek,

20:12.110 --> 20:15.170
if he's there, I won't be.
I'm the bride, so I have to be.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.672
So I'm begging you.
He's not invited. OK?

20:18.750 --> 20:20.775
- OK.
- Thank you.

20:20.819 --> 20:23.117
Mm-hmm.

20:23.155 --> 20:26.989
If you don't make this deal, who's gonna
pay your bills? Take care of you?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.892
They tried to kill me,
just like they killed Kaili,

20:29.928 --> 20:33.193
just like they kill all those
defenseless trees,

20:33.265 --> 20:36.029
all of the creatures
that live in those trees.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.934
You are not a defenseless
tree-living creature.

20:38.971 --> 20:42.532
You are an adult woman
who made a decision to trespass.

20:42.574 --> 20:46.908
It was unbelievably stupid, naive,
just unbelievably irresponsible.

20:46.979 --> 20:50.244
- What about unbelievably brave?
- Excuse me?

20:50.315 --> 20:52.681
Trees may not be my thing, but...

20:52.718 --> 20:54.879
...even if it was stupid, it was brave.

20:54.953 --> 20:57.854
She slept in a 200-year-old tree
and watched as a bulldozer

20:57.889 --> 21:00.619
knocked her off.
She was standing for what she believed.

21:00.659 --> 21:02.593
You have to admit, she's brave.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.789
How can trees not be your thing?

21:07.499 --> 21:11.128
Karen? Karen?

21:11.169 --> 21:13.569
Damn it. Pulse is weak. Start her on O2.

21:13.639 --> 21:15.971
See if you can get a femoral pulse.

21:17.509 --> 21:19.773
She's bleeding out.
We need her stabilized.

21:19.845 --> 21:23.372
- What's happening to my sister?
- Julie, you need to clear out.

21:23.482 --> 21:26.815
- Get her out of here.
- Karen? Karen?

21:26.852 --> 21:30.117
Get her ready for transport
and tell the OR we're on our way, now!

21:30.188 --> 21:32.986
Damn it. Too many bleeders.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.926
Hang another bag of O neg and
get me some fibrin sealant.

21:35.994 --> 21:37.928
- Can I help?
- You are helping.

21:37.996 --> 21:40.464
You've got more bleeders
than you have hands.

21:40.532 --> 21:42.830
- Sorry.
- No, that's it.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.859
You get in there and take over.

21:44.903 --> 21:46.768
- Yang, run to my truck!
- What?

21:46.838 --> 21:49.932
Run to my truck.
It's where I always park it.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.842
Run fast. In the glove box,
there's a green bag.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.540
- Pull harder on that retractor.
- I am a surgeon...

21:55.614 --> 21:58.583
I'm trying to save a life, Yang. Run!

22:02.688 --> 22:07.091
Oh... The Lovers card.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.854
Do you know what this means?

22:08.894 --> 22:12.557
Yes. No. Yes...
Mom, can you please shut up?

22:12.597 --> 22:15.122
Meat. Definitely some kind of meat.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.997
You're killing me, you know that?

22:18.070 --> 22:20.163
It means the sex is hot.

22:20.205 --> 22:23.299
I bet that little mole didn't
get in the way, right?

22:23.342 --> 22:25.276
Honey, hey. Listen.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.836
Isn't it time for my scan?
Isn't it time for my scan right now?

22:28.880 --> 22:30.211
I'll go check.

22:30.248 --> 22:32.011
- See if I can get things moving.
- Thank you.

22:33.385 --> 22:37.515
Tell me about Dr. Hottie.
How long have you been together?

22:40.092 --> 22:44.324
Mom? It's not just a mole.

22:44.396 --> 22:49.993
I have stage IV melanoma.
It's in my organs. It's not just a mole.

22:52.104 --> 22:56.234
You don't have skin on your organs, hon.
Doesn't make a whole lotta sense.

22:58.276 --> 23:00.836
Don't just sigh at me, Isobel.

23:00.912 --> 23:03.506
Just, you know... just explain.

23:04.483 --> 23:07.213
OK, um...

23:07.252 --> 23:11.951
You remember when Grammy
had that tumor on her thyroid?

23:13.959 --> 23:15.859
Grammy died.

23:16.728 --> 23:19.788
She died. She...

23:19.831 --> 23:23.062
Really soon after that, she died.

23:27.672 --> 23:29.139
Why are you...

23:30.876 --> 23:32.605
...telling me...

23:33.612 --> 23:37.878
You have a mole.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.282
I don't understand...
You have a mole.

23:41.520 --> 23:45.616
OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
that was a bad comparison.

23:45.657 --> 23:47.181
What I have is nothing like
what Grammy had.

23:47.225 --> 23:50.922
- No. No...
- OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:50.996 --> 23:54.557
Just breathe. It's OK.
I'm OK. Just breathe. OK?

23:54.633 --> 23:58.865
It's OK. It's OK.
I'm OK. Just breathe.

24:04.009 --> 24:06.534
I've got a good feeling about this.

24:06.578 --> 24:09.411
I think those mets are shrunk way down,

24:09.448 --> 24:12.417
and I think I'm gonna go right in
and take the rest out.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.214
Really? You think that?

24:14.252 --> 24:17.517
Did your psychic tell you so?

24:17.589 --> 24:21.753
This scan has to be good.
It has to be good.

24:21.793 --> 24:26.253
Listen, if it's not, it's not the end of
the world. There are other therapies...

24:26.298 --> 24:27.492
She'll never leave.

24:27.532 --> 24:30.831
If this scan isn't good?
If I can't give her good news...

24:30.902 --> 24:32.062
She won't leave.

24:32.137 --> 24:35.595
I love my mom.
I don't mean to sound... ungrateful...

24:35.640 --> 24:37.301
I just...

24:37.342 --> 24:40.038
It was me. I called her.

24:40.078 --> 24:41.807
I really...

24:41.847 --> 24:45.578
I thought it was Alex. Or George.

24:45.617 --> 24:49.951
It was me. Because...
I'd want to know if my kid was sick.

24:49.988 --> 24:53.116
And if I was sick,
I would want my mom.

24:53.158 --> 24:58.858
I thought you were being too proud,
or you were trying to protect her.

24:58.897 --> 25:01.991
Now I get that you were
trying to protect yourself.

25:02.033 --> 25:05.901
She's not a bad person.
She was a great mom.

25:05.971 --> 25:09.031
She's just... limited. She's...

25:09.674 --> 25:11.471
...limited.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.070
This scan has to be good.

25:14.145 --> 25:18.172
It has to be good. It has to be good.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.876
Hang more blood. Come on, Willow.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.447
Come on. You lived in a tree.
You crapped in a bucket, for God's sake.

25:25.490 --> 25:27.788
- You can do this.
- She crapped in a bucket?

25:27.826 --> 25:30.294
- What're you doing here?
- Saw it on the board.

25:30.328 --> 25:32.990
Never seen an intermedullary rod
put into a femur.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.055
So... bucket?

25:34.132 --> 25:36.396
Yeah. Bucket on a pulley.

25:36.434 --> 25:40.666
She's up in the tree.
She lowers a crap bucket to her friend,

25:40.705 --> 25:45.642
every day, who empties it, cleans it,
puts food in it and sends it back up.

25:45.677 --> 25:48.771
- That's friendship.
- Yeah.

25:52.617 --> 25:55.552
They teach us in med school
how not to care so much.

25:55.587 --> 25:57.919
We drape the patients,
so we don't see faces.

25:57.956 --> 26:00.891
We do a thousand things
to care a little less.

26:00.926 --> 26:03.156
But you care like crazy and I love that.

26:04.129 --> 26:08.122
And I'll keep loving that, even if
you decide to lie to your family.

26:13.004 --> 26:15.404
Nice work, Yang. Open the bag.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.034
See the bottle with the blue label?

26:18.076 --> 26:21.204
Open it, pour it in a sterile basin
and give it to O'Malley.

26:23.248 --> 26:26.945
Shake it onto the wound.
Right over the bleeders. A lot of it.

26:27.018 --> 26:28.383
What is this stuff?

26:29.688 --> 26:33.089
Use it in the field all the time.
It's not FDA-approved, but...

26:33.158 --> 26:36.889
...it's saved a lot of lives. When you
don't have time to stitch a guy up,

26:36.928 --> 26:40.625
pour some of this on, and it holds
things till you get to an OR.

26:40.699 --> 26:42.496
Look,
it's locking up the wound.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.559
Replicates the clotting process.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.800
Not a permanent solution,
but it buys us some time.

26:47.839 --> 26:51.036
BP's going up.
He's stabilizing.

26:51.076 --> 26:52.338
Magical.

26:54.879 --> 26:57.871
I think it's gonna be fine.

26:57.916 --> 27:00.817
I think those mats are
gonna be teeny tiny.

27:00.885 --> 27:03.945
It's, uh, "mets," Mom. Mets.

27:03.989 --> 27:07.083
- Mets. Like baseball?
- Yeah. Like baseball.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.487
Good news. Great news.

27:12.564 --> 27:15.465
The cancer's practically gone.

27:15.533 --> 27:19.264
Looks like your psychic was right,
Mrs. Stevens.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.431
Looks like we caught it early after all.

27:21.473 --> 27:26.035
Oh, thank you, God.
Thank you! Oh, my baby.

27:26.111 --> 27:29.569
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Thank you!

27:29.614 --> 27:32.708
Thank you! Thank you!

27:32.751 --> 27:36.187
Thank you, thank you. Mm!

27:37.689 --> 27:41.181
But I knew it.
Didn't I?

27:41.226 --> 27:45.253
I knew it. I knew.
Because you're my Cricket.

27:45.296 --> 27:47.526
Nothing can happen to you.

27:49.567 --> 27:53.401
- I love you, Mom.
- Oh, I love you, too, my baby girl.

27:53.471 --> 27:56.668
I love you so, so much.

28:02.747 --> 28:05.045
God, look at me, I must be a mess.

28:05.116 --> 28:07.277
I'm gonna go clean up.

28:07.318 --> 28:08.342
And then, uh...

28:08.386 --> 28:13.915
And then I'm gonna call Jade and
Ms. Norris. I got them all so worried.

28:21.966 --> 28:23.831
Just tell me.

28:25.236 --> 28:28.296
The mets have shrunk some.

28:28.339 --> 28:31.502
But there are new mets, too.

28:31.543 --> 28:35.536
Several new mets. In the small bowel.

28:35.613 --> 28:38.377
- No surgery, then.
- Oh, I'm gonna operate.

28:38.450 --> 28:41.442
I'm gonna take out
absolutely everything I can,

28:41.486 --> 28:45.217
be as aggressive as I can.
We'll take it from there.

28:46.191 --> 28:48.989
- OK.
- OK.

28:53.231 --> 28:56.132
You just have to give her room.
You two have history...

28:56.167 --> 28:58.294
- I apologized.
- I know and it's loaded.

28:58.369 --> 29:02.135
She keeps yelling at me that
I'm not her father. Well, I'm not.

29:02.173 --> 29:05.108
I fell in love with her mother.
That's all I did.

29:06.144 --> 29:08.578
Her mother never
got over you, and she...

29:08.613 --> 29:10.604
That's not my fault! I was young.

29:10.648 --> 29:12.411
Lots of people have affairs.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.441
They have affairs and they don't...

29:14.486 --> 29:17.455
What Ellis did after I left,
that's on Ellis.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.957
And I'm trying to run a hospital here.

29:19.991 --> 29:23.290
- She's doing the best she can.
- Her best isn't good enough.

29:23.328 --> 29:27.697
If any other resident pulled
the crap she did today...?

29:27.732 --> 29:30.223
She is still here
because of my history with you.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.168
That's it. That's the only reason.

29:32.203 --> 29:34.967
Keep saying you're not her father,
but... Since we're talking...

29:35.039 --> 29:38.270
You're the most professional guy.
The most level-headed.

29:38.309 --> 29:40.140
Except when it comes to Meredith.

29:40.178 --> 29:41.202
You gave me hell.

29:41.246 --> 29:44.340
You weren't gonna give me Chief
because I was dating Meredith.

29:44.382 --> 29:47.317
You told her about the ring,
sent her to bring me back.

29:47.385 --> 29:48.943
That's not running a hospital.

29:49.020 --> 29:52.683
You paged her to try on dresses.
You paged her today for Thatcher.

29:52.724 --> 29:56.626
You have history with her.
You keep saying you're not her father.

29:56.694 --> 29:59.219
But the way you act,
you consider her family.

30:00.098 --> 30:01.725
For what it's worth.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.334
- What happened?
- Hunt is incredible.

30:12.377 --> 30:17.815
The guy shouldn't be alive. 17 bullets?
He has one lung, one kidney left...

30:17.849 --> 30:19.612
- Dr. Grey!
- Meredith?

30:19.651 --> 30:22.347
I'm sorry for the way
I spoke to you earlier.

30:22.387 --> 30:23.581
- Dr. Grey!
- Don't.

30:23.621 --> 30:25.612
I know I was out of line.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.854
I know I can't possibly imagine
what you've been through.

30:28.893 --> 30:31.987
But I also know that this
can not be your daughter's story.

30:32.030 --> 30:35.864
That she shot her dad 17 times
to protect her mom

30:35.934 --> 30:38.835
and you went back to him.

30:38.870 --> 30:42.738
You have to change her story
while you still have a chance.

30:42.807 --> 30:44.206
For both of you.

30:44.242 --> 30:49.373
But for her, for your little girl...
You have to change her story.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.255
I'll pack my stuff.

31:11.603 --> 31:16.233
She lost a lot of blood,
but she's stable now.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.245
They weighed the cost.

31:24.415 --> 31:25.677
I'm sorry?

31:25.717 --> 31:29.483
They weighed the cost of killing her
over letting her stay up there.

31:29.554 --> 31:33.547
And then they got a bulldozer
and knocked her out of a tree.

31:35.126 --> 31:38.095
They knocked my baby sister
out of a tree.

31:38.129 --> 31:39.892
Jules?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.629
I'm here.

31:43.701 --> 31:45.794
Hey, I'm here.

31:46.771 --> 31:51.470
I filed a lawsuit, against Schuster and
Werner, a ten million dollar lawsuit.

31:52.844 --> 31:56.439
We're gonna make those bastards
pay for this, you hear me?

31:57.749 --> 31:59.808
I'm gonna make them pay.

31:59.884 --> 32:03.820
We can plant so many trees
with ten million dollars.

32:04.622 --> 32:08.581
And when we win?
The check will be made out to Karen.

32:14.132 --> 32:16.100
My tree girl made it through?

32:19.570 --> 32:21.538
I can't lie.

32:21.572 --> 32:25.235
Even if they think I'm wrong,
even if they don't understand,

32:25.276 --> 32:28.109
even if they think I'm crazy...

32:29.013 --> 32:32.949
I'm me. They're supposed to accept me.

32:32.984 --> 32:37.148
They're supposed to support me.
They're supposed to love me, you know?

32:40.491 --> 32:42.049
I can't lie.

33:00.345 --> 33:02.108
Great.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.875
Is this another heart to heart?

33:03.915 --> 33:08.545
I know you don't like me.
You have every right not to like me.

33:08.586 --> 33:12.147
I have abused my power,
but now I'm here on your turf.

33:12.190 --> 33:13.589
What I need to say...

33:14.592 --> 33:18.050
What I need to say is,
I saw what your mother was doing.

33:18.129 --> 33:21.963
I saw how neglected you were.
I saw her drive your father off.

33:22.033 --> 33:25.059
I spent a lot of time
beating myself up about that.

33:25.103 --> 33:29.005
But what does that do for you?
Nothing. Nothing.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.508
I wasn't your advocate.

33:36.047 --> 33:40.245
I didn't fight for you.
I never stood up for you.

33:40.284 --> 33:43.742
I let myself off the hook.

33:43.821 --> 33:48.224
I told myself I was young and didn't
know better. But I did know better.

33:48.259 --> 33:51.422
And I wasn't much younger
than you are now.

33:54.699 --> 33:57.793
I should've fought for you, Meredith,

33:57.869 --> 33:59.928
like you fought for that child today.

33:59.971 --> 34:05.136
I told myself I wasn't your father,
that it wasn't my responsibility,

34:05.209 --> 34:07.404
that I was right not to butt in.

34:07.445 --> 34:10.312
I let myself off the hook.

34:22.193 --> 34:26.186
You were helpless. You were a baby.

34:27.665 --> 34:32.261
A beautiful, smart, funny little girl.

34:35.172 --> 34:38.074
And no one stood up for you.

34:43.447 --> 34:45.780
I'm so sorry.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.614
I'm so sorry.

34:58.663 --> 35:00.722
I'm so sorry.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.728
I'm so sorry.

35:06.037 --> 35:09.336
<i>As doctors,</i>
<i>we can't undo our mistakes</i>

35:09.373 --> 35:12.103
<i>and we rarely</i>
<i>forgive ourselves for them.</i>

35:12.143 --> 35:13.735
<i>But it's a hazard of the trade.</i>

35:14.612 --> 35:17.877
<i>But as human beings,</i>
<i>we can always try to do better,</i>

35:17.915 --> 35:22.249
<i>to be better, to right a wrong,</i>
<i>even when it feels irreversible.</i>

35:22.320 --> 35:24.982
You sure you don't want me to stay?

35:25.056 --> 35:28.787
I'm sure. I'm OK.

35:28.860 --> 35:30.794
I'll be OK.

35:33.030 --> 35:35.260
If you're not,
you know where to find me.

35:39.036 --> 35:42.995
I love you, Mom. I love you so much.

35:44.642 --> 35:47.338
But we do better
loving each other from a distance.

35:53.417 --> 35:56.352
You were always too good
for that trailer park.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.784
That I knew.

35:59.824 --> 36:04.454
I might not know that much and I might
not be quite as smart as you, but...

36:07.398 --> 36:09.764
...I always knew that.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.708
<i>Of course, "I'm sorry"</i>
<i>doesn't always cut it.</i>

36:19.744 --> 36:22.474
<i>Maybe because we use it</i>
<i>so many different ways.</i>

36:22.513 --> 36:24.413
<i>As a weapon, as an excuse...</i>

36:24.448 --> 36:26.279
Nice work today.

36:27.084 --> 36:28.984
"Nice work today?" Seriously?

36:29.020 --> 36:30.920
- I'm sorry?
- "Run to my truck?"

36:30.955 --> 36:34.447
You got O'Malley clipping bleeders
and you tell me to run to your truck?

36:34.525 --> 36:37.221
You know what my truck looks like.
O'Malley doesn't.

36:37.261 --> 36:39.092
And that run saved a guy's life.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.928
All day you were teaching O'Malley
and ignored me.

36:41.966 --> 36:44.867
O'Malley wants to be
a trauma surgeon. You declared cardio.

36:44.902 --> 36:49.202
I didn't do anything wrong today.
I treated you like I would anyone else.

36:49.240 --> 36:53.074
I am not like anyone else.
"Take care now?" What is that?

36:53.110 --> 36:56.238
What, are you, like, happy now?
What are you?

36:56.280 --> 36:59.477
Just a "choke 'em and forget 'em"
kind of guy?

37:08.626 --> 37:13.029
"Hey there, now. Take care, now.
Nice work, Yang." What is this?

37:13.064 --> 37:17.194
My shrink gave me these sentences.
We came up with them together.

37:17.268 --> 37:20.533
They're three-word sentences,
so I'd have something to say

37:20.605 --> 37:22.766
instead of the three words that are...

37:26.110 --> 37:28.271
...that are killing me.

37:30.314 --> 37:33.306
The three words that you know
I feel, but I can't say them,

37:33.384 --> 37:37.514
because it would be cruel to say them,
because I am no good for you.

37:38.789 --> 37:42.247
I don't want to torture you.
I don't want to look at you longingly

37:42.293 --> 37:45.057
when I know I can't be with you.
So I'm smiling,

37:45.096 --> 37:47.656
and I'm saying, "Take care, now."

37:51.902 --> 37:54.097
I'm letting you off the hook.

37:55.373 --> 37:58.604
I'm trying so hard
to let you off the hook.

37:58.643 --> 38:02.135
I'm trying to make it right
what I did to you.

38:02.179 --> 38:06.206
Can't you see that?
I'm trying to make it right.

38:11.989 --> 38:13.786
Take care, now.

38:31.942 --> 38:34.308
<i>But when</i>
<i>we are really sorry...</i>

38:34.345 --> 38:37.473
<i>When we use it right? When we mean it?</i>

38:38.649 --> 38:43.712
We're leaving. For good, we're leaving.

38:43.788 --> 38:46.985
As I understand, you'll be
too weak to follow us soon,

38:47.024 --> 38:49.720
so I'm sure you won't
be able to follow us later.

38:49.794 --> 38:53.821
So... We're here to say goodbye.

38:54.832 --> 38:58.893
Say goodbye to Daddy. This is
the last you'll be seeing of him.

39:00.137 --> 39:02.935
Bye, Daddy. Feel better.

39:12.817 --> 39:15.251
- Bye, Dr. Grey.
- Bye, Maddy.

39:24.729 --> 39:28.392
<i>When our actions say</i>
<i>what words never can...</i>

39:32.203 --> 39:34.535
Sorry I'm late.

39:37.375 --> 39:42.540
Um... Dad, this is Mark Sloan.
Dr. Mark Sloan.

39:42.580 --> 39:45.071
- He's my...
- Teacher?

39:45.116 --> 39:48.381
No. He's my...

39:48.419 --> 39:50.250
He's Mark.

39:50.287 --> 39:52.346
Nice to meet you, Mr. Grey. I'm...

39:54.658 --> 39:56.751
So nice to meet you.

39:56.827 --> 39:59.887
Vice versa. Please, grab a chair.

40:14.645 --> 40:16.806
OK. It tastes like shrimp.

40:16.847 --> 40:18.178
Alex...

40:18.249 --> 40:21.514
But listen, the shrimp kinda tastes...

40:21.552 --> 40:24.680
...sweet and spicy. Like our first date.

40:24.755 --> 40:28.350
The good part. The part
before I didn't kiss you on the porch.

40:28.392 --> 40:30.053
OK. Nice.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.790
The chicken tastes like...

40:32.830 --> 40:36.664
...a drive to the beach with the windows
down and the dog hanging out.

40:36.700 --> 40:40.636
Like when you're a kid. Salty...
Tastes good. But...

40:40.671 --> 40:43.231
I vote for the shrimp,
if we have to choose.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.174
There's one more.

40:47.144 --> 40:49.669
OK, yeah, that tastes like crap.

40:50.981 --> 40:54.610
OK, the OR's prepped and ready.
How about you?

40:54.652 --> 40:56.347
Yeah, I'm ready.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.096
Now I taste like crap.

41:25.216 --> 41:29.414
<i>When we get it right,</i>
<i>"I'm sorry" is perfect.</i>

41:36.927 --> 41:41.523
We have to move the wedding up
for Izzie. She's...

41:43.534 --> 41:45.525
OK.

41:45.569 --> 41:47.628
Packing up your mom's journals?

41:47.705 --> 41:50.367
Yeah, there's nothing in these for me.

41:50.407 --> 41:53.103
I keep thinking...
I don't want to throw them away.

41:53.143 --> 41:55.907
So I was gonna give them to the chief.

41:56.714 --> 42:00.810
And... he can come to the wedding.

42:00.851 --> 42:04.309
If you want. He can come.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.913
OK.

42:07.157 --> 42:11.924
<i>When we get it right,</i>
<i>"I'm sorry" is redemption.</i>
