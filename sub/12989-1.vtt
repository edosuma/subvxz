00:24.024 --> 00:27.242
This field general court martial
finds the accused, Private Peaceful,

00:27.243 --> 00:31.207
guilty as charged in accordance
with Section 4 of the Army Act.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.535
You will remain in custody until sentenced.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.373
These proceedings are now terminated,
take away the prisoner.

00:38.455 --> 00:42.050
Sir, prisoner and escort, left turn.

00:42.793 --> 00:45.421
Left, right, left, right, left.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.595
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.

00:49.258 --> 00:52.387
Left, right, left, right, left, right...

01:04.230 --> 01:05.278
Ten to midnight.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.652
I shan't sleep.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.154
I won't dream it away.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.999
Tonight, more than any other night of my life,

01:14.992 --> 01:16.494
I want to feel alive.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.097
Let's go. Before we get caught.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.437
Twelve pheasants.

01:44.313 --> 01:45.781
- Twelve?
- Yeah.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.450
My land, my pheasants.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.170
We should be out, working in the fields.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.041
We'll learn more at school. It's not so bad.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.633
Honest.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.136
Whenever you say honest, Charlie,

02:08.628 --> 02:09.881
I know it's not true.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.678
H6)'...

02:28.357 --> 02:29.404
Fred.

02:29.733 --> 02:30.825
All right, Pete.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.829
- Hello.
- Hello.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.202
Watch where you're going, Peaceful.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.704
Mr Munnings is coming!

02:48.043 --> 02:51.343
You do not come to school in bare feet.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.507
You do not lie.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.597
You do not cheat.

02:56.385 --> 02:59.855
These are my commandments.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.687
Do I make myself clear?

03:03.433 --> 03:04.855
Yes, sir.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.907
Admiral Nelson.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.906
General Baden-Powell.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.783
Great British heroes.

03:20.117 --> 03:24.793
Fighting for king and country.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.291
From Waterloo...

03:27.374 --> 03:29.593
"Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.553
"O, what a panic's in thy breastie!"

03:32.212 --> 03:34.260
"Still thou are blest, compared wi' me!"

03:34.881 --> 03:36.804
"The present only toucheth thee."

03:37.217 --> 03:38.218
Yes, Nipper?

03:38.760 --> 03:41.058
Why am you be talking foreign, miss?

03:41.430 --> 03:43.899
It's not foreign, it's about a mouse.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.146
It's Scottish.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.061
And where is Scotland?

03:48.937 --> 03:50.405
England, miss?

03:53.233 --> 03:54.610
I can do it, Charlie.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.914
Double knot, so it will never come undone.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.660
Is he your brother?

04:04.161 --> 04:05.663
What does your dad do?

04:06.329 --> 04:07.421
Gamekeeper.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.424
My dad's a rat catcher.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.506
Like the Pied Piper?

04:11.793 --> 04:14.637
Yes. Only he don't like children.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.423
Tommo.

04:17.466 --> 04:18.512
Hello, Joe.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.474
That's lovely, Joe.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.768
Oranges and lemons...

04:29.603 --> 04:32.650
- He's got a loony for a brother.
- What did you say, Jimmy Parsons?

04:32.651 --> 04:35.489
Your brother's a loony,
your brother's a loony.

04:35.490 --> 04:37.111
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.667
Jimmy Parsons
won't be doing that again, Tommo.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.673
Got him in the goolies.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.890
Your wife, sir.

05:51.893 --> 05:55.193
Can't we stay outside
in the fresh air a little longer?

05:55.438 --> 05:56.781
It's far too cold.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.033
Thank you.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.290
And what did you boys
get up to at school today?

06:09.703 --> 06:10.920
This and that.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.629
What have you done to your face, Tommo?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.931
Bread and butter pudding, my favourite.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.392
Tommo.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.782
My favourite.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.416
- Hello, Joe.
- Father.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.915
How was the shoot, James?

06:52.996 --> 06:54.339
Ask the boys.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.293
We were at school. Honest.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.086
Colonel saw the best of it.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.423
He's a silly old fart.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.137
Mad old duffer.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.765
He may well be a silly old fart,

07:08.345 --> 07:11.315
but it's the Colonel who pays your wage
and puts the roof above your head.

07:11.473 --> 07:14.192
It's not his money, he married into it.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.195
- Now, now...
- He's a silly old bugger.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.115
You must show more respect.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.281
Well, I show my respect
where respect's due, my love.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.615
"What big eyes you have, Grandma, '

07:28.698 --> 07:30.200
"said Little Red Riding Hood.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.374
"'All the better to see with, ' said the wolf.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.501
"What big teeth you have, Grandma.'

07:35.789 --> 07:37.382
"'All the better

07:37.666 --> 07:39.714
"'to gobble you up."'

07:44.130 --> 07:45.347
We're too old for this.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.847
Big Joe don't get stories
like you do at school.

07:47.968 --> 07:48.969
School.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.554
Will you come up to the woods with me
on Saturday, Tommo?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.140
We'll clear the dead trees.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.978
The only dead wood around here
that needs clearing's in Tommo's head.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.564
I thought you were putting the boys to bed.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.576
What are all you men looking at?

08:16.079 --> 08:18.047
Seems sad to chop down the old trees.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.383
Well, it clears space for the walnuts.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.385
I don't like walnuts.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.171
Walnut trees are special.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.844
- Why?
- It's the grain of the wood.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.510
It makes fine furniture.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.102
Come on, Biddy,
these ladies haven't got all day.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.727
Yes, Miss Far.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.235
Some may not even have that long.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.693
Morning, Aunty.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.907
And what might you be after, Hazel Peaceful?

08:45.908 --> 08:47.402
More blacking for the stove.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.529
Well, you'll have to take your turn
like everyone else.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.707
Come on, Joe.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.629
Morning, madam.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.427
The Colonel's usual, if you please.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.554
I'll deliver it myself.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.550
There you go.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.401
My deliverer.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.279
Your pinch of snuff, Colonel.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.573
I'd like to pinch you, Miss Far.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.157
Colonel.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.245
Don't mind him, he's the soul of discretion.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.001
How is your good wife?

09:37.577 --> 09:38.624
Poorly.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.630
Still?

09:41.498 --> 09:44.672
Not long to go, I fear.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.512
I love it here.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.635
Just the two of us.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.940
It's a damn sight more peaceful,
just the one of you.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.612
Which one of us do you love the most?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.356
Me or Charlie?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.486
Or Big Joe?

10:08.316 --> 10:09.363
Or Big Joe.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.991
Well, you know, Big Joe is special.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.453
You know, I have three sons, Tommo.

10:16.199 --> 10:19.203
And each one I've loved so much
that when the next one's come along,

10:19.285 --> 10:22.004
I didn't fathom
how I had any more love in me.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.130
But since you ask,

10:28.461 --> 10:31.305
I love my heir apparent, Charlie, the most.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.174
I hate you.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.803
- I hate you!
- I'm teasing, Tommo!

10:57.240 --> 10:59.334
"Wee, sleekit, cowrin,"

11:00.743 --> 11:02.211
"tim'rous beastie..."

11:02.662 --> 11:04.881
"...sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie,

11:04.998 --> 11:07.000
"O, what a panic's in thy breastie!"

11:07.333 --> 11:09.427
"Still thou are blest, compared wi' me!"

11:10.044 --> 11:12.263
"The present only toucheth thee."

11:21.514 --> 11:22.561
I'm sorry.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.189
Stay back!

11:29.689 --> 11:30.861
Run!

11:34.027 --> 11:36.621
Run! Tommo, run!

11:37.697 --> 11:38.914
Run!

12:07.977 --> 12:10.105
He should wear his Sunday best.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.322
Needs pressing.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.951
And there's a button missing.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.572
Very James Peaceful, I must say.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.616
James Peaceful was a good man.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.706
One of the finest workers I have known.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.205
Always cheerful as he went about his work.

13:07.912 --> 13:12.463
The Peaceful family
have been employed by my family,

13:12.959 --> 13:15.007
by my wife's family,

13:16.296 --> 13:17.593
five generations.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.259
And in all the 20 years,

13:22.176 --> 13:28.604
he worked as gamekeeper
and forester on the estate.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.486
James Peaceful was a credit

13:33.479 --> 13:37.325
to his family and his village.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.492
We shall remember him.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.117
We now commit his body to the ground.

13:46.034 --> 13:49.004
Earth to earth. Ashes to ashes.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.502
Dust to dust.

13:52.206 --> 13:56.302
In the sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life

13:57.462 --> 14:00.213
through our Lord Jesus Christ, amen.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.306
Amen.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.574
I have no wish
to intrude upon your grief, Mrs Peaceful,

14:18.191 --> 14:23.243
and forgive me if this seems
a little indelicate.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.032
But there is the matter of the cottage.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.409
Our cottage?

14:28.034 --> 14:30.082
Strictly speaking, it's a tied cottage.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.756
Tied to your husband's
employment on the estate.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.050
Now, of course, that he's gone...

14:36.250 --> 14:37.422
You want us out?

14:37.543 --> 14:40.171
Well, not if we can come to an arrangement.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.726
There's a position up at the house
that might suit you.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.594
Lady's maid to my dear wife.

14:46.719 --> 14:50.064
That's very good of you, Colonel,
but I have my children.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.684
I have considered that.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.772
And I'm pleased to offer Charles
employment in my hunt kennels.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.782
Thomas, of course, is still at school.

15:00.525 --> 15:01.777
As for the other one,

15:02.777 --> 15:07.123
well, there's always the lunatic asylum.

15:07.907 --> 15:11.252
I could never do that, Colonel, never.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.464
You do understand
the position you're in, Mrs Peaceful?

15:15.581 --> 15:16.582
Yes, I do.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.928
My condolences, Mrs Peaceful.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.931
Miss Far, good day.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.766
You married the first man
that turned your head.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.817
Nothing but a forester.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.944
He couldn't even do that properly.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.280
I'll need your help, Aunty.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.273
No, Hazel.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.571
Please.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.133
How beautiful.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.434
Where has she got to?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.187
Come along now, eat up.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.313
I'm not hungry.

16:20.438 --> 16:21.530
Waste not, want not.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.862
I want bread and butter pudding.

16:22.863 --> 16:25.326
Potatoes is all you'll be getting
from now on.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.664
Coarse and vulgar, and no manners.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.493
Mother.

16:33.618 --> 16:34.868
Not now, Joe.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.167
I don't know
what the Colonel was thinking of.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.506
A lady's maid at your age.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.502
Please don't go yet.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.338
I have no time, Hazel.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.966
I have a business to run, you know that.

16:55.056 --> 16:59.653
One day, the woodcutter's sons
spied the evil old Colonel

17:00.144 --> 17:03.990
pushing his harmless,
dear little wife into the lake

17:04.232 --> 17:05.324
to drown her.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.242
Charlie...

17:07.359 --> 17:11.404
And so the nasty Colonel
and horrible Grandma Wolf

17:11.405 --> 17:12.702
lived unhappily ever after.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.701
And had lots of monster children

17:14.825 --> 17:17.544
with hairy whiskers
coming out of their nostrils.

17:19.579 --> 17:20.672
Charlie?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.877
Are you thinking about Father?

17:26.087 --> 17:27.179
How he died.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.220
What are we gonna do?

17:32.718 --> 17:34.095
About what?

17:34.720 --> 17:36.017
About Mother.

17:36.722 --> 17:40.397
About Grandma Wolf,
being hungry all the time.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.894
We'll scavenge in the forest.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.772
We can tickle for trout in the river.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.903
It's the Colonel's river.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.575
His land.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.860
You work for him.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.622
No one owns the wildlife, Tommo.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.588
Empire Day.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.090
The late Queen's birthday.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.391
God bless her.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.265
Today we remember the warriors

18:15.595 --> 18:19.600
who died with honour
fighting for their country overseas.

18:20.308 --> 18:23.101
And God bless the British Empire

18:23.102 --> 18:27.107
and the taming of the natives
to the greater glory of civilisation.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.493
But whilst we must cherish our past,

18:31.485 --> 18:33.908
we must all look forward to the future

18:34.822 --> 18:37.120
and the greatness that lies therein.

18:38.075 --> 18:40.828
And with that, I now declare

18:41.287 --> 18:45.133
the Empire Garden FÃ©te well and truly open.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.591
Thank you.

19:12.985 --> 19:13.986
Who are you?

19:15.363 --> 19:16.455
Queen of the Amazons.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.959
Molly Monks,
my father's the Colonel's new gamekeeper.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.501
Where are you from?

19:24.872 --> 19:25.964
Peru.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.500
What?

19:28.834 --> 19:31.132
This is my little brother, Tommo.

19:31.462 --> 19:32.509
I'm nearly 11.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.839
Hello, Tommo.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.808
- She's called Molly, and she's from Peru.
- Where?

19:37.551 --> 19:39.344
And I'm Charlie Peaceful.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.392
Age 13.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.395
Meet Charlie in the barley for a parley?

19:44.725 --> 19:46.693
This is my older brother, Big Joe.

19:46.811 --> 19:47.858
Little Joe.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.860
Pleased to meet you, Peaceful brothers.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.657
What does your father do?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.530
He was the Colonel's gamekeeper.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.027
I see.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.363
- He's dead.
- Dad's dead.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.411
I'm sorry.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.584
Have you got brothers and sisters?

20:02.410 --> 20:04.412
No, I haven't even got a mother.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.216
Hey, no secrets, Tommy Peaceful.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.385
Tommo. I'm Tommo.

20:12.503 --> 20:13.550
Come on, Charlie.

20:13.754 --> 20:14.846
Where are you off to?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.048
Nowhere.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.551
Honest.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.076
Shite and onions.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.569
That was your fault.

20:36.694 --> 20:37.741
What did I do?

20:39.405 --> 20:40.406
This way.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.250
Monks, the gamekeeper.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.461
Run, Tommo.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.872
No, Charlie,

20:48.581 --> 20:50.128
if one goes, we both go.

20:50.624 --> 20:51.716
You best stay put then.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.419
'Cause I'm going nowhere.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.062
Be careful.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.907
What do you think of Molly?

21:19.236 --> 21:21.785
She's all right for a girl.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.305
Morning.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.516
Mr Monks.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.650
I'm the bearer of sad news.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.780
It's the lady of the house, she passed away.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.943
She's been unwell, you know.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.051
Goodbye, Mr Monks.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.634
What is it, Mother?

22:25.010 --> 22:26.978
The Colonel's wife has passed away.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.397
I don't believe it.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.516
The Colonel killed her.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.063
No, of course he didn't.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.566
What a terrible thing to say, Tommo.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.736
She's been frail for a long while now.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.695
She died peacefully in her sleep.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.157
So, that's it then.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.576
You lost your job,
the Colonel's throwing us out.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.074
No.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.576
- You're to stay on his hunt kennels.
- Good.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.418
And I'm to take in
the Colonel's laundry, here.

22:51.419 --> 22:53.039
So I can look after Big Joe again.

22:53.414 --> 22:54.586
And what about Grandma Wolf?

22:54.874 --> 22:57.218
- Now, don't call her that.
- Why not'?

22:58.043 --> 23:01.422
She prowls around in sheep's clothing
whenever the Colonel's watching.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.390
What did she get up to now?

23:19.273 --> 23:21.071
What did you do that for, Jimmy Parsons?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.701
Go on then, Peaceful.

23:23.027 --> 23:25.576
- You're not worth it.
- Need your big brother to fight for you?

23:25.738 --> 23:28.742
Form a scab and drop off, dung breath.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.806
There, you keep it.

23:52.806 --> 23:54.149
Keep it forever.

23:54.725 --> 23:55.772
I will.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.611
Till the day I die.

23:57.895 --> 23:59.943
You'll need to wash it before then.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.654
How did your mother die, Molly?

24:04.068 --> 24:05.445
She died as I was born.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.576
She gave me life, Tommo.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.580
Don't you feel bad that you...

24:16.622 --> 24:18.841
I feel sad that she isn't here to love me.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.135
I still love her.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.467
Like you still love your father.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.594
I suppose.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.787
Can I tell you something, Molly?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.365
Tell me what?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.041
- I think you're...
- Race to the river!

24:54.201 --> 24:55.293
Hey!

24:56.495 --> 24:57.838
Wait for me.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.542
H6)'...

25:04.294 --> 25:05.341
Hold on.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.237
I dare you to take off all your clothes.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.067
- No!
- Go on.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.198
- No!
- I will if you will.

25:25.399 --> 25:26.491
- No.
- No.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.051
Come on in, the water's lovely.

25:53.719 --> 25:54.891
Come on.

26:02.436 --> 26:05.189
Come on, boys, be a man.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.362
See, it's not that cold.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.206
Come on in, Tommo, the water's lovely.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.802
Don't worry, Tommo,
the fish won't nibble your bits.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.632
See, it's not that bad.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.646
It's freezing, I'm turning blue.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.932
No peeping...

26:47.648 --> 26:48.945
I said no peeping.

26:53.487 --> 26:54.955
I want to die.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.582
Right here and now.

26:56.990 --> 26:59.459
Because no tomorrow
could ever be as good as today.

27:00.244 --> 27:03.464
I'm going to tell the future.
I've seen gypsies do it.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.188
The stones say
that as long as we stick together,

27:19.304 --> 27:21.272
we'll be lucky and happy till the day we die.

27:23.267 --> 27:24.985
Do the stones say who you'll marry?

27:25.602 --> 27:26.649
Yes.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.485
Mr Peaceful.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.362
Crossed fingers, Molly's stones.

27:35.654 --> 27:40.000
They're just <i>as</i> reliable
or unreliable as praying to God.

27:41.493 --> 27:42.961
Well...

27:50.961 --> 27:52.338
I want to see my brother.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.173
I don't think so.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.142
I want to see Charlie.

28:01.889 --> 28:03.641
I didn't hate my father.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.357
He died trying to save me.

28:10.063 --> 28:11.861
Fathers and sons.

28:14.484 --> 28:15.701
Fathers and sons.

28:16.403 --> 28:17.700
Father?

28:20.324 --> 28:22.201
Your father is in God's hands now.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.751
As we're all destined to be, my son.

28:24.752 --> 28:26.213
I don't believe in heaven.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.593
I'm not sure I've ever really believed in God.

28:33.253 --> 28:37.554
At church, I'd look up at Jesus
hanging on the cross,

28:39.760 --> 28:42.104
and wonder why God,

28:44.097 --> 28:46.099
who is supposed to be his father,

28:47.392 --> 28:51.067
almighty and powerful,

28:53.607 --> 28:55.405
would let them do that to him.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.737
Would let him suffer so much.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.789
If there is a God, why was my father killed?

29:07.913 --> 29:09.915
Why did this war happen?

29:13.085 --> 29:14.962
Why will morning come?

29:27.724 --> 29:29.772
Happy in your work, Thomas Peaceful?

29:36.608 --> 29:38.110
Afternoon, Tommo.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.820
Afternoon, Molly.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.947
Mind out, you clot.

29:42.447 --> 29:45.792
- Sorry, Grandma.
- Don't you call me that around here, Thomas.

29:45.909 --> 29:47.752
Makes me sound old and crotchety.

29:47.828 --> 29:51.924
- When really you are young and kind-hearted.
- I can hear you, Thomas Peaceful.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.793
The Colonel wants tea for two.

29:55.085 --> 29:56.132
At 3:00.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.503
Yes, ma'am.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.097
And how do I take my tea?

29:59.923 --> 30:01.266
Same as yesterday, ma'am.

30:01.508 --> 30:02.976
Precisely.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.145
Same as the day before...

30:05.262 --> 30:06.684
Stop muttering, Molly Monks.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.692
Well, he's old and slow.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.155
He's no use for hunting.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.024
- No, sir.
- No use to anyone.

30:17.025 --> 30:18.116
No, sir.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.784
Well, you know what to do.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.453
- Sir.
- Charlie?

30:21.945 --> 30:23.492
What is it, lad?

30:24.489 --> 30:25.706
He's done you no harm.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.044
The hounds are my property,
I decide whether they live or die.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.162
Yes, you do, sir.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.624
- But he's Molly's favourite.
- That's sentimental rot.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.675
<i>He's a useless old beast.</i>

30:36.710 --> 30:38.838
- I got him, sir.
- Good man.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.181
Take care of it.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.390
Charlie.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.710
Bring the car out!

31:19.169 --> 31:20.887
Go on now, go on now, boy!

31:21.463 --> 31:23.886
He had no idea, Charlie, we did it.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.347
That's it, run! Run!

31:26.468 --> 31:28.516
A proper job, Tommo.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.397
I'll make an apple pie to go with the stew.

31:32.398 --> 31:34.064
Here, boy, in here, in here.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.692
Get out of my way!

31:39.689 --> 31:41.908
4330995!-
Get him inside, get him inside.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.531
The Colonel's following.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.576
He's not just following you, Charlie Peaceful,
he's right behind you.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.578
I've got the sheets
ready for you now, Colonel.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.996
I'm not here for the blasted linen.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.916
- Thomas?
- Sir?

31:56.998 --> 31:59.342
- Charles.
- This dog had run away, sir, honest.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.761
Liars as well as thieves.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.091
- I beg your pardon, Colonel.
- I had to do it, Mother.

32:04.092 --> 32:05.932
- Do what, Charlie?
- He told me to shoot him.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.427
- Shoot who?
- I can do as I like with him.

32:08.510 --> 32:09.557
With Who?

32:09.719 --> 32:12.347
He stole one of my hounds, Mrs Peaceful.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.266
And as magistrate of this village...

32:14.391 --> 32:18.269
So, am I to understand, Colonel,
that if you were to shoot this hound,

32:18.270 --> 32:20.113
then he was of no use to you at all?

32:20.114 --> 32:21.607
No, no use.

32:23.275 --> 32:26.404
Joe, would you fetch the money
mug from the mantel piece, please?

32:26.570 --> 32:28.038
Money mug.

32:29.573 --> 32:31.200
- Money, Mother.
- Thank you, Joe.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.121
There you are, Colonel. Six pence.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.711
Not a bad price for a useless old dog.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.297
So now he's not stolen, is he?

32:44.129 --> 32:45.722
You're both fired.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.478
I don't know what you're so pleased about.

32:52.554 --> 32:54.648
You've both just lost your jobs.

33:10.155 --> 33:11.998
- Thomas Brass, sir.
- Hello, lad.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.120
Morning.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.456
Any work for a young labourer?

33:16.244 --> 33:18.167
No, I've got no work for you here, lad.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.497
Nothing?

33:19.498 --> 33:22.502
No, I've got my men, I don't need no more.
Sorry, lad.

33:31.927 --> 33:33.520
And another pint then, please.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.138
Hang on.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.691
No. You better make that a half.

33:38.808 --> 33:39.980
To your health.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.374
Nice one, Jimmy.

33:54.491 --> 33:55.959
I did it for you, Fred. We're a team.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.286
Buck up, Nipper.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.553
Nice one, Freddo.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.214
- All right, Tommo?
- Nipper.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.512
Out of a job, is it?

34:11.632 --> 34:13.054
Well, you know, Pete.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.058
There's a card game Friday fortnight
against the King's Arms.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.726
We could do with a reserve.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.900
Old enough now
to play with the lads, are you?

34:20.016 --> 34:21.563
Young Peaceful.

34:22.851 --> 34:24.353
I'll have a go.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.489
- What's trumps?
- Hearts.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.760
- Sod it.
- What'd you play that for?

34:47.877 --> 34:49.594
You're supposed to be counting the cards.

34:49.670 --> 34:52.422
Looks like someone's lost their place
on the card team, Jimmy.

34:52.422 --> 34:53.891
Better luck next time there, Jimmy.

34:55.677 --> 34:57.099
Well done, Tommo.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.600
So, how is the farm?

34:58.847 --> 34:59.939
Hard on your own?

35:00.056 --> 35:01.228
I'll get by.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.607
- There's always help at harvest.
- It's a lot of work, though.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.446
And you're not getting
any younger, mind you.

35:06.447 --> 35:07.735
Hey, cheeky.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.366
Well...

35:11.860 --> 35:12.907
Well what?

35:14.279 --> 35:16.077
How about I come and work for you?

35:20.076 --> 35:22.295
I suppose that'd serve the Colonel right,

35:23.079 --> 35:24.706
if I did take you on.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.797
- Both of you.
- Both of us?

35:28.293 --> 35:29.920
But one wage, mind.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.681
We brought our hound to see you, look.

36:18.682 --> 36:20.975
Hello, Billy old boy.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.311
You smell sweet.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.646
That pong's not Billy, it's you.

36:30.605 --> 36:31.822
That's horse poop.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.155
- It's better than dog shite, though.
- Hey!

36:34.359 --> 36:36.202
We don't want you Peacefuls here.

36:36.444 --> 36:37.866
Bothering our Molly.

36:38.488 --> 36:39.865
She don't want to see you.

36:40.699 --> 36:41.791
Go on.

36:43.159 --> 36:44.206
Go on.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.673
Come on, Billy.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.561
Charlie?

37:03.888 --> 37:04.889
Charlie?

37:07.350 --> 37:09.148
How are we gonna see Molly again?

37:13.314 --> 37:14.361
We're not.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.239
No.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.493
It's good to have women out of your hair.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.434
- I'll walk.
- All right.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.186
Don't be late, though, Tommo lad.

37:43.762 --> 37:44.763
I won't.

38:22.550 --> 38:23.972
Get up there, boys.

38:26.763 --> 38:29.061
I think Molly might meet us later.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.483
In secret.

38:31.976 --> 38:35.105
Play your little daft games
without me, Tommo, all right?

38:37.440 --> 38:38.942
Work, Tommo!

38:45.156 --> 38:46.624
Thank you.

38:49.244 --> 38:51.338
Damned Hun.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.585
Call in the cavalry.

38:54.082 --> 38:57.302
We shall be fighting with the Frenchies
against the Bosch.

39:09.806 --> 39:11.103
Molly.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.026
Molly?

39:17.856 --> 39:19.858
- Make yourself scarce.
- Hey, come here.

39:20.984 --> 39:23.157
I miss you, both.

39:24.612 --> 39:27.365
Come here. Come here!

39:34.622 --> 39:36.795
Come on, girls. That's right.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.548
There's one.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.545
There's one. There's one.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.673
There's two, there's two.

39:44.883 --> 39:45.884
Come on in, girl.

39:46.009 --> 39:48.808
Bring us another one.
Bring us another one. That's it.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.061
- Come on, girl.
- There she is.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.398
Ooh err, look at this at one.

40:00.315 --> 40:01.362
I think I'm in love.

40:01.649 --> 40:02.696
Pardon?

40:04.694 --> 40:06.071
I think I'm in love.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.327
Well, which one? Her?

40:16.331 --> 40:19.050
You're far too young to be in love, Tommo.

40:21.377 --> 40:22.594
All right, boy'?

40:31.596 --> 40:32.597
Come on, girls.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.467
Thanks, Charlie.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.521
I dare you to take off all your clothes.

41:59.934 --> 42:01.151
No!

42:01.519 --> 42:03.613
Come on, boys, be a man.

42:16.951 --> 42:18.703
That's strange, Joe.

42:36.012 --> 42:37.480
It's war.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.692
Horses and guns.

42:45.188 --> 42:47.566
That's how we beat the Boer in the Cape.

42:47.815 --> 42:51.490
And how we knocked the stuffing
out of the Zulu in Natal.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.571
Horses and guns.

42:53.654 --> 42:56.533
But we work with cart horses,
you daft old bug...

42:58.326 --> 43:01.000
You'll need hunters, not ploughers.

43:01.662 --> 43:06.509
Our horses will no sooner charge into battle
than I skip home before last orders.

43:09.212 --> 43:11.214
It's not just the cavalry.

43:11.672 --> 43:13.263
How do you move the great guns,

43:13.264 --> 43:15.931
the ammunition trains,
the supply magazines?

43:16.344 --> 43:19.097
The army needs all the horses it can get.

43:19.180 --> 43:20.932
And all the men.

43:21.015 --> 43:25.612
Fit, able-bodied young men,
ready to fulfil their patriotic duty.

43:26.896 --> 43:28.944
The old fart...

43:29.774 --> 43:31.742
Up the revolution!

43:53.881 --> 43:55.633
They've thrown her out.

43:56.425 --> 43:58.769
Her father and the Colonel
have thrown her out.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.473
- It's your fault, Charlie.
- Why? What's going on?

44:02.598 --> 44:06.068
What's going on
is that she's gonna have your baby.

44:06.978 --> 44:08.730
That's what's going on.

44:38.301 --> 44:39.928
I didn't want to hide it from you, Tommo.

44:40.011 --> 44:42.981
- But you did hide it from me.
- She didn't want to hurt you.

44:45.308 --> 44:46.776
You love her, don't you?

44:49.687 --> 44:51.030
But I love her, Tommo.

44:52.440 --> 44:53.783
She loves me.

44:56.861 --> 44:58.363
She's not a girl any more.

45:02.033 --> 45:04.331
- I hate you.
- No, you don't, Tommo.

45:09.498 --> 45:11.341
And besides, who'll be my best man?

45:11.542 --> 45:12.885
Jimmy Parsons?

45:12.960 --> 45:14.803
- You're getting married?
- Of course.

45:15.796 --> 45:17.218
But not to Jimmy Parsons.

45:22.887 --> 45:23.888
Fï¬‚ends?

45:44.408 --> 45:45.751
Well, James,

45:46.911 --> 45:49.039
he left school sooner than you wanted.

45:49.914 --> 45:52.417
And now he's gone
and got a nice girl pregnant.

45:54.335 --> 45:56.178
Who does that remind you of?

46:06.055 --> 46:07.432
Thank you.

46:46.721 --> 46:47.768
No wedding bells?

46:49.807 --> 46:50.808
No bells.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.264
Like triplets.

47:35.936 --> 47:36.983
Joe?

47:38.189 --> 47:39.190
Are you awake?

47:42.193 --> 47:43.991
Father died because of me, Joe.

47:45.654 --> 47:47.031
It was my fault.

47:47.698 --> 47:49.996
Oranges and lemons,

47:51.285 --> 47:52.707
say the bells of...

47:55.456 --> 48:00.713
You owe me five farthings,
say the bells of St Martin's.

48:02.713 --> 48:07.219
When will you pay me?,
say the bells of Old Bailey.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.892
Who would shoot their own soldiers?

48:17.812 --> 48:20.235
- Itchy <i>sods,</i> lice.
- Could be worse.

48:20.564 --> 48:21.907
Could be crabs.

48:23.067 --> 48:27.243
I see the French and they shoot
their lot for cowardice all the time.

48:27.571 --> 48:29.073
What good's that do?

48:30.574 --> 48:33.498
And the generals and the politicians,

48:34.662 --> 48:38.257
they think it stops us from asking
what we're doing out here in the first place.

48:38.374 --> 48:39.842
Well, it bloody doesn't.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.845
Why don't you just let him off?

48:44.713 --> 48:46.590
Let him sit out the war behind bars?

48:48.676 --> 48:49.928
Anything.

48:50.428 --> 48:51.520
No.

48:55.558 --> 48:59.779
Here comes a candle to light you to bed.

49:01.063 --> 49:05.910
And here comes a chopper
to chop off your head.

49:06.152 --> 49:10.328
Chip chop, chip chop, the last man's dead!

49:16.287 --> 49:17.664
Tommo!

49:19.206 --> 49:21.208
Don't sweep up where I just cleaned then.

49:21.292 --> 49:23.420
Well, do it yourself then.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.555
All right.

49:36.932 --> 49:39.401
Come on, Tommo, go on and punch me.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.900
Come on, yourself.

49:41.979 --> 49:46.826
Come on. Come on, then, Tommo.
Come on, Tommo.

49:49.945 --> 49:51.743
- Come on, then, boy.
- I'm not a boy.

49:51.822 --> 49:53.995
Break it up, lads. Break it up!

49:59.038 --> 50:03.259
It's official. War Office, they want my horses.

50:03.584 --> 50:05.131
That's stupid.

50:05.377 --> 50:09.678
You can't argue with them, Charlie.
We dance to their tune.

50:11.383 --> 50:12.851
"Calling all horse herders."

50:13.219 --> 50:15.642
I need you to deliver them to market.

50:15.763 --> 50:16.810
I'll do it.

50:54.343 --> 50:57.517
- Here, sir.
- That's quite all right. Thank you.

50:58.639 --> 51:00.733
Look after 'em, won't you?

51:04.061 --> 51:06.780
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.

51:07.523 --> 51:08.740
I shan't beat about the bush.

51:09.858 --> 51:13.408
I shan't tell you it's all tickety-boo
out there in France.

51:13.487 --> 51:15.080
It's an hard slog.

51:15.781 --> 51:19.035
There's only one question you need to
ask yourselves about this war.

51:19.451 --> 51:22.500
Who would you rather see
marching through your streets?

51:22.580 --> 51:24.253
Us lot? Or the Hun?

51:25.207 --> 51:29.132
Because if we don't beat them over there,
they'll come marching through right here,

51:29.211 --> 51:33.762
burning your houses, violating your women,
killing your children.

51:35.009 --> 51:36.886
They've not only beaten brave little Belgium,

51:36.969 --> 51:39.848
but now they've taken
a fair slice of France, too.

51:40.472 --> 51:44.648
If we don't beat them at their own game,
they'll gobble us up <i>as</i> well.

51:45.144 --> 51:49.524
- Well, do you want the Hun here?
- No!

51:49.607 --> 51:50.904
'D0 you?
- No!

51:50.983 --> 51:54.328
- Shall we blast them to kingdom come?
- Yes!

51:54.737 --> 51:56.910
Then we shall need you.

51:57.906 --> 52:01.160
And all the brave lads out in France
need you, too.

52:01.243 --> 52:04.247
And remember one thing, lads,
and I can vouch for this,

52:05.664 --> 52:08.008
all the ladies love a soldier.

52:08.417 --> 52:09.794
Come on!

52:09.877 --> 52:14.223
Now, who'll be the first brave lad
to come and take the King's shilling?

52:14.298 --> 52:17.097
I'm looking for boys with hearts of oak,

52:17.509 --> 52:19.807
lads who love their king and country,

52:19.887 --> 52:23.107
men what hates the lousy Hun.

52:23.682 --> 52:27.107
Go on, son. Go and fight.

52:27.561 --> 52:30.690
It's every man's duty to fight
when his country calls.

52:31.649 --> 52:32.866
Go on!

52:33.817 --> 52:35.114
You're not a man.

52:35.819 --> 52:39.164
Coward! Coward!

52:40.908 --> 52:42.160
Coward!

52:47.539 --> 52:50.668
Farmer Cox sent me to market.
The army was there recruiting.

52:50.751 --> 52:53.220
Jimmy Parsons joined up, and Pete, Fred.

52:53.295 --> 52:56.720
Don't worry about it, Tommo.
They can't make you go.

52:56.799 --> 52:58.893
You're too young, anyway.

52:59.134 --> 53:00.306
I'm nearly 16.

53:00.511 --> 53:03.310
You gotta be 19 to serve overseas, Tommo.
They don't want boys.

53:03.389 --> 53:04.561
I'm not a boy.

53:04.723 --> 53:07.317
- Baby boy, baby boy...
- Stop it now, Joe.

53:08.394 --> 53:11.864
Anyway, that's what
the professional army's for.

53:12.898 --> 53:15.742
They're a brave lot, though, the volunteers.

53:15.943 --> 53:18.696
If women had their say,
there wouldn't be war in the first place.

53:20.489 --> 53:23.117
Charlie, you wouldn't go, would you?

53:23.200 --> 53:24.668
No, don't be daft.

53:26.704 --> 53:29.583
I'd shoot a rat, because it might bite me.

53:31.166 --> 53:33.885
I'd shoot a rabbit, 'cause I could eat that.

53:34.753 --> 53:36.551
But why would I wanna shoot a German?

53:37.214 --> 53:39.091
I never met a German.

53:40.092 --> 53:43.892
You've seen the lists, Tommo?
All the killed and wounded?

53:44.346 --> 53:45.939
What's it for?

53:46.557 --> 53:48.901
So a few little rich men
can hang on to power a little while longer

53:48.976 --> 53:50.353
while they bleed us dry?

53:50.978 --> 53:53.731
- I don't know about that, Charlie.
- No, it ain't right.

53:54.189 --> 53:56.942
I couldn't bare the loss.
Not with James gone.

53:57.192 --> 53:58.444
It's better than shovelling shit.

53:58.527 --> 54:01.201
It's better than breaking your back
all your life working someone else's land.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.327
And it's better pay, too.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.204
It's not a job that lasts forever, though,
is it, Tommo'?

54:04.324 --> 54:05.541
Well, who wants to get stuck here forever?

54:05.617 --> 54:08.370
Here is home, Tommo.
This is where you're from.

54:08.829 --> 54:10.376
Who would you rather see
walking through the streets?

54:10.456 --> 54:11.582
Us lot or the Hun?

54:11.665 --> 54:13.133
Grow up, Tommo, please.

54:13.208 --> 54:14.551
You're a coward, Charlie Peaceful.

54:16.378 --> 54:17.675
And you're tired, Tommo.

54:18.172 --> 54:20.846
So don't say anything
you'll regret in the morning.

54:27.389 --> 54:29.391
- Name?
- Thomas Peaceful.

54:30.392 --> 54:33.111
- Occupation?
- Farm labourer.

54:33.937 --> 54:36.941
- Date of birth?
- Fifth of October.

54:37.983 --> 54:39.155
Year?

54:44.072 --> 54:45.449
Year, lad?

54:47.034 --> 54:48.911
Fifth of October, 1895.

54:54.458 --> 54:55.835
Sign this.

54:57.961 --> 55:00.055
Now report to the doctor.

55:01.632 --> 55:02.884
Next.

55:02.966 --> 55:04.639
- Name?
- John Moody.

55:05.594 --> 55:07.096
- Occupation?
- Labourer.

55:08.388 --> 55:09.685
Date of birth?

55:11.475 --> 55:12.692
Cough.

55:13.393 --> 55:15.066
Fit as a fiddle.

55:16.063 --> 55:18.065
Stand up straight, lad.

55:18.482 --> 55:20.359
There you are. 5'10".

55:21.693 --> 55:23.115
Breathe in.

55:36.750 --> 55:38.377
Come along, Tommo!

56:23.881 --> 56:25.224
Watch me.

56:28.677 --> 56:29.724
Louise.

57:16.183 --> 57:19.107
- Nipper.
- Tommo.

57:26.234 --> 57:27.986
I love you, Molly.

57:49.216 --> 57:51.685
What, you're not embarrassed
to kiss me in front of your pals?

57:51.760 --> 57:52.807
No.

57:53.679 --> 57:55.522
No, why should I be?

57:56.765 --> 57:59.109
Charlie, what's bothering you?

58:02.521 --> 58:05.491
All the lads going off to war,
and I'm staying here.

58:05.565 --> 58:08.694
Charlie, they're not about to become fathers!

58:27.212 --> 58:30.512
My little boy. What have you done?

58:31.383 --> 58:33.556
It's what Father would've wanted.

58:33.635 --> 58:35.637
I'm not so sure, Tommo.

58:39.933 --> 58:43.437
There. Your father wanted you to have it

58:44.521 --> 58:46.523
when you were grown up.

58:48.233 --> 58:49.780
I don't smoke.

59:10.630 --> 59:14.305
Put that bloody fag out!
You want your head blown off?

59:14.384 --> 59:15.476
Sergeant?

59:15.552 --> 59:18.681
No smoking in the trenches at night!

59:19.056 --> 59:20.148
Why not?

59:20.223 --> 59:24.945
Because Fritz will snipe your cobblers off,
you berk!

59:25.020 --> 59:28.240
But we're not in the trenches, Sergeant,
and it's daytime.

59:28.315 --> 59:31.239
Stand still! Chest out!

59:31.318 --> 59:33.867
Stomach in! Look to the front!

59:42.037 --> 59:43.539
Jesus Christ.

59:45.248 --> 59:48.343
And you're the best
they can send us these days?

59:49.836 --> 59:53.306
And I'm supposed to make
bloody soldiers out of you.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:02.979
Name!

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:06.903
Peaceful, Sergeant. Private Tommo Peaceful.

01:00:07.395 --> 01:00:10.399
- You want your head blown off, Peaceful?
- No, Sergeant.

01:00:10.482 --> 01:00:13.361
- You want your nuts blown off, Peaceful?
- No, Sergeant.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:16.947
- You want your arse blown off, Peaceful?
- No, Sergeant.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:21.376
- Then you do what I say, when I say it.
- Yes, Sergeant.

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:22.577
Thank you, Sergeant Hanley.

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:25.046
Captain Wilkins, sir!

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:29.922
At ease.

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.762
You've all had a long voyage, men.

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:38.844
A hard march.

01:00:41.763 --> 01:00:44.516
You have leave to visit the local estaminet.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:48.650
- The what, sir?
- The pub, and the first round's on you.

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:50.272
Sir!

01:00:58.864 --> 01:01:00.241
Who are they?

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.872
Indians, Tommo. Soldiers like you and me.

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:05.625
- Are those fellows singing foreign?
- Foreign.

01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:11.923
No, I don't understand
a word they're saying anyway.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.342
Who's that?

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:17.803
- Hey, Tommo lad!
- Charlie!

01:01:19.885 --> 01:01:22.729
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Well, someone had to look after this one.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:24.147
I can look after myself.

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:25.849
And what took you so long, mate?

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:27.855
- Parsons.
- Better late than never.

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:31.188
If you'd left it much longer,
the war would've been over.

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:36.910
- Where'd you get that?
- Mother. It's the best watch in the world.

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:38.862
It's Father's watch.

01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:41.406
- Heir apparent.
- Grub's up!

01:01:41.489 --> 01:01:45.039
And she is the hors d'oeuvre.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:48.668
You are a fighting boy, Tommy?

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.798
Not Tommy. Tommo.

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:54.302
I do not understand.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.093
But I think you are too young to be in a war.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:02:00.051
I'm old enough. I'm fighting here
with my pals and my brother.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.302
Go home, Tommy.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:05.309
No likey, Monsieur Bum Fluff.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:11.562
Vous likey un tumble dans the hay avec moi.

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:14.360
You're just boys.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:19.865
- Anna, where is the blaze?
- Yeah.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.538
Here! More beers.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.544
That is my daughter.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:31.794
I'd rather have a cider.

01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:34.547
Five beers, one cider.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.048
And what are you laughing at, baby face?

01:02:40.131 --> 01:02:42.179
Parsons, you've got a face like
an old whore's arse.

01:02:42.801 --> 01:02:43.893
Stuff a sock in it.

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:47.519
- Hey, here's to home.
- And Mr Munnings.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:50.400
- Grandma Wolf.
- Cheers.

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:53.228
And the Colonel. May they all suffer
the misery they so richly deserve.

01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:54.938
- Fair enough.
- Yeah, I'll fetch the beers.

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:02.988
What's your name, Private?

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:06.242
Peaceful. Private Peaceful.

01:03:06.574 --> 01:03:07.746
Are you being funny?

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:12.123
You know what these three stripes are, boy?

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:13.752
That makes you a sergeant,

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:15.959
which means you'll never make an officer.

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:18.379
Which makes you one of the lads.

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:23.092
Thank you.

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:25.431
Good luck, Sergeant.

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:29.313
Here he is.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.069
Right, to Molly.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.901
That's for me to say. To Molly.

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:42.156
- Molly.
- Molly.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.663
- To Molly.
- To Molly.

01:03:56.791 --> 01:04:03.174
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And smile, smile, smile.

01:04:04.215 --> 01:04:11.315
While you've a Lucifer to light your fag
Smile, boys, that's the style.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:14.894
What's the use of worrying?

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:21.866
Off home, lads?

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:24.569
England's that way, boys.

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:25.778
Do send our love.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:27.409
Platoon, halt!

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:31.793
Private Peaceful.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.745
- Sergeant?
- Sergeant?

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:36.752
Sentry duty. Both of you.

01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:38.959
Well, what do we do then?

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:46.850
If you nod off, it'll be a court martial
if Fritz doesn't shoot you up the arse first.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:54.357
Quick march!

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.782
Fine night for poaching, Tommo.

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:14.460
What happened to all the trees?

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.904
What's the matter, Peaceful?
Scared of mice?

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:49.158
Parsons, save that for them, all right?

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.619
Big man, Private?

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:55.164
Not exactly, Sergeant.

01:05:56.161 --> 01:05:59.256
I'm just a country boy, like yourself.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.306
Message received.

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:19.734
- Why are we here?
- I'm sure it's important.

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.277
As you were.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.864
We have orders to send out
a patrol into the trench opposite

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:27.237
to bring back a prisoner for questioning.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:30.992
HQ need to know
what enemy regiments have been deployed.

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:34.499
Righto. Volunteers.

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:39.750
There's a double rum ration in it
for anyone who does.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:40.921
- I'm in then, hell.
- I'm in.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.089
Me, too.

01:06:42.165 --> 01:06:44.293
The old village card team?

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:53.351
Jimmy, Fred, with the Sergeant.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.019
Pete! Pete!

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:57.517
Fetch the stretcher bearers on the double.
Keep your heads down, lads.

01:06:57.597 --> 01:06:59.565
Keep your head down, Sergeant.
Keep your head down, Sergeant.

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:00.858
Stretcher bearers!

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.561
Come on, Sarge! I've got you.

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:05.022
Up you get. On your feet, sir.

01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:07.027
Come on, Sergeant. Come on up, Sergeant.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:09.108
Leave me, get yourselves out.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:12.529
One goes down, we all go down.
Ain't that right, Sergeant?

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:14.285
Come on, come on!

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:17.618
Keep his head down, fellas. Keep it down.
Come on, come on.

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:30.718
- Thank you, Peaceful.
- Anything for an officer.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.609
Gas! Gas! Gas!

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:32.237
Gas! Gas! Gas! Gas!

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:33.826
Follow the drill!

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:36.116
Don't panic, Tommo.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:37.947
Gas drill!

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:48.542
Tommo, listen. Listen!
Stick with me, all right? Come on!

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:54.639
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:02.930
Don't shoot me, mister, please!

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:05.358
I don't shoot boys. Go, boy.

01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:08.187
Go, Tommy, go. Go!

01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:13.274
I'll kill you. I'll kill you, you German bastard!

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:27.997
All clear!

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:30.841
Prepare for counter-attack!

01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:59.867
Stretcher bearers. Stretcher bearers.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.454
- You'll be all right, Charlie Peaceful.
- All right, good luck, Fred.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:14.715
Next.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:23.182
Private Peaceful, Doctor.
I was in the gas attack.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.097
Let's take a look at you.

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:30.776
Mouth.

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:39.493
Breathe in and out.

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:45.036
You didn't catch a whiff of it. Next!

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:46.789
I can't see straight. I can't breathe.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:50.504
Calm down, man. You were lucky.
Take a look outside.

01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:51.873
Next.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:53.708
All right, come on.

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:11.522
Tommo!

01:11:12.518 --> 01:11:14.145
Charlie! What happened?

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:17.315
Bullet, shrapnel.

01:11:18.483 --> 01:11:21.282
Bled like a pig, boy.
They're sending me back.

01:11:21.486 --> 01:11:22.578
Back?

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:25.782
Congratulations, Peaceful. Your ticket home.

01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:28.455
I'll be sure to send your love, Sergeant.

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.664
They're not taking you now, Charlie?

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:34.540
Together.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:37.377
Tommo, you'll be all right.

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:40.547
Hey, Tommo, keep your chin up.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:41.722
I'll write to you.

01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:43.508
Better still, you write to me.

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:47.016
- Well, we'll see you soon, Charlie.
- Cheerio, lads.

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:51.812
Don't any of you other yellow bastards
go shooting yourselves in the foot.

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:54.273
Hey, hey, hey!

01:11:54.352 --> 01:11:56.571
All right, don't you worry, Sergeant,
we won't.

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:59.487
All right, come on. Come on, Tommo.

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:05.739
All that fighting, no gain on either side.

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:07.540
Have another beer.

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.664
- Here's to a horrible bloody Hanley.
- All right.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.588
I'm going after Charlie.

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:20.295
And how will you get there? Swim?

01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:22.221
I'll find a way. I'll get back somehow.

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:25.345
But that's desertion, Tommo.
They shoot deserters.

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:27.017
Hang on! Tommo!

01:12:27.635 --> 01:12:29.012
Forget him.

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:30.604
Tommo!

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:35.609
- Tommo!
- Well, he won't have gone far.

01:12:47.071 --> 01:12:50.200
You gave me a fright.
What are you doing here?

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.835
Er... you are ill?

01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:57.165
Hiding from your friends?

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.084
I've seen you before, I think.

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:02.674
My name is Anna.

01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:05.844
I'm Tommo.

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:09.678
So, it's true then.
Every English soldier is called Tommy.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:13.022
No, not Tommy. I'm Tommo.

01:13:13.764 --> 01:13:16.893
And what do you do when you're at home,
Tommy-Tommo,

01:13:17.768 --> 01:13:20.191
when you're not playing soldiers?

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:21.986
I work on a farm.

01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:23.483
You're a farmer?

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:26.445
No, I'm not really.
I work on Farmer Cox's farm.

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:29.788
In the fields. Sheep, horses.

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:31.537
- Horses?
- Yes.

01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:40.045
He's magnificent.

01:14:06.359 --> 01:14:07.531
Anna!

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:18.914
You promise you return? Yes?

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:20.418
I promise.

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:50.703
Charlie.

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:10.678
"They brought young children to Christ,
that he should touch them.

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:13.510
"And his disciples rebuked
those that brought them.

01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:16.847
<i>"But when Jesus saw it, he was displeased,</i>

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:21.526
"and said unto them,
'Suffer the little children to come unto me,

01:15:22.226 --> 01:15:24.854
"'for of such is the kingdom of God.'"

01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:27.364
"And he took them up in his arms"

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:29.908
"and blessed them."

01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:37.325
And who's left to make the ammunition?

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.035
Bloody women.

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:43.665
See, the problem with Kitchener's army
is they're all amateurs.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.761
In my day, we were a regular army.
Professionals.

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:50.679
Well, the Hun would be on the run now

01:15:50.755 --> 01:15:54.385
if these young scamps
were as brave as we were then.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:56.469
Just one big push.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:58.680
You're a silly old fart, Colonel.

01:15:59.638 --> 01:16:01.231
I beg your pardon.

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:03.435
The world's changing, old man.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:07.818
When you lot stop ruling our bloody lives,
England will change, too.

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:09.649
There'll be no more empire.

01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:12.030
No more land owners exploiting
the labour of the masses.

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:14.077
And there'll be no more bloody war!

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:15.742
You anarchist!

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:17.323
Call me what you like, Colonel.

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:22.295
You can blast us to smithereens out there
on the front line, but you'll not stop us.

01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:27.921
We're fighting the Germans,
but we're at war with your kind, too.

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:32.680
And the whole world's about to be
ripped apart by the likes of me.

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:01.121
Mr Monks.

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:07.673
- You're a grandfather.
- I heard.

01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:18.341
One day, when this war is over,
we shall all be together again,

01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:21.972
and young Tommo will see his uncle
for the first time and smile.

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:25.733
Big Joe already smiles at him.

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:28.524
And little Tommo has Big Joe's great grin,

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:31.363
and Charlie's nose and your blue eyes.

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:35.826
Because of all this,
I love him more than I can say.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:38.029
Your Molly.

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:48.748
- All right, Tommo?
- All right, boys.

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:55.171
Where's Anna?

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:58.090
Anna? The girl that works here?

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:00.597
We had a rendezvous.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.524
She's with her other
gentlemen friends, lover boy.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:15.946
Monsieur. Anna? Where's Anna?

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:23.907
Pardon?

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:25.408
Gone.

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:27.036
Gone? Gone where?

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.797
God. Anna's dead.

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:32.215
I don't understand.

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:36.261
Dead? Dead! My daughter is dead!

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:39.465
How? What happened'? She can't be dead.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:42.639
Fetching eggs from the next village.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:45.221
For you soldiers. For your supper.

01:18:45.763 --> 01:18:49.438
One big bomb shell. Boom, and she's dead.

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.610
I'm sorry.

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:57.571
Go to hell, Tommy.

01:18:57.816 --> 01:19:01.616
Go to hell, you English, you Germans,
you French.

01:19:01.779 --> 01:19:03.452
And take your war with you.

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:04.914
The hell...

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:17.341
Silly man! You know I do...

01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:22.429
They won't want you back.
You were injured.

01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:23.930
And Tommo?

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:26.262
And little Tom mo?

01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:30.646
You think I should just stay here
and let them fight without me?

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:32.808
That'll make our son proud?

01:19:32.809 --> 01:19:34.483
I just want everything to be <i>as</i> it was.

01:19:34.484 --> 01:19:36.151
And then you'll love me?

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.989
I do love you, you silly man. You know I do.

01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:40.610
Well, be more loving then, Mol.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.947
Christ's sake, there's a bloody war on.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:20:00.300
You've upset little Tommo
with your bickering.

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:02.469
No, we're not bickering, Mum. Honest.

01:20:02.715 --> 01:20:04.137
Charlie,

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.010
being married is hard,

01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:10.644
but not having a husband and a father
for your children is the hardest of all.

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:15.570
So listen to what your wife has to say before
making promises to yourself and your pals.

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:22.155
You curse the filthy Hun!

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.828
You insert your bayonet,

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:28.875
you twist it, you pull it out clean again.

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:34.372
Twist it!

01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:38.760
I'm the best bloody teacher
you lads will ever have.

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:41.087
Stand down.

01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:43.840
All right, now.

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:47.886
These old lads will now show you the ropes.

01:20:47.887 --> 01:20:49.853
Which am I then, Sergeant?

01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.848
A new lad or an old clown?

01:20:53.015 --> 01:20:56.064
Well, well, well, Private Peaceful.

01:20:57.603 --> 01:20:59.355
Back for second helpings?

01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:01.949
Well, I wasn't gonna miss this, Sergeant.

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:06.530
I'm warning you. I've got my eye on you.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.239
One step out of line...

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:12.085
Don't you worry about me, Sergeant.
I'll be good as gold.

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:14.708
Cross my heart and hope to die.

01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:20.129
- Get to the end of the line, soldier.
- Sergeant.

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:26.887
High port!

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:32.805
- How's Molly? Little Tommo?
- Don't ask me about them.

01:21:33.639 --> 01:21:34.931
Why not?

01:21:34.932 --> 01:21:37.435
I can tell you plenty about home.

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:41.739
Hedgerows are untrimmed, fields lie fallow.

01:21:43.399 --> 01:21:46.494
There's no one to plough the fields, is there?
There's no lads.

01:21:46.985 --> 01:21:49.579
Just don't ask me about them, Tommo.

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:53.659
Not out here.

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:58.005
They don't belong here.

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:01.300
They belong back there at home.

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:03.169
Do you understand?

01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:08.098
Port arms!

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:18.605
Clear.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:23.529
Clear.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:26.991
Filthy.

01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:34.038
Private Peaceful, rifle above your head, now!

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:36.710
About turn!

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.788
Doubling at the double!

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.458
Double! Double!

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:46.303
Double! Double! Double!

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:49.973
Double! Double! At the double!

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:53.518
Get up! Get up! Get up!

01:22:56.346 --> 01:22:57.689
You move.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:03.356
You drop that rifle, Private Peaceful,
you begin the punishment again.

01:23:03.357 --> 01:23:05.321
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, Sergeant.

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:08.366
- I didn't hear you!
- Yes, Sergeant!

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:10.368
Now move your feet!

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:15.370
Move!

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:18.828
You get up.

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:20.921
Get up. Get up!

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:25.877
You wanna try it, Sergeant?
You wanna pick on someone? Leave him be!

01:23:25.878 --> 01:23:27.002
Go on!

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:30.551
Leave it, Charlie.

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:31.889
You were saying?

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:35.891
- Leave it, Charlie.
- The rest of you men, fall out!

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:37.391
Charlie.

01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:52.695
Steady up there.

01:23:54.905 --> 01:23:56.452
Lieutenant Buckland.

01:23:56.532 --> 01:23:58.375
Attention!

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:03.381
Insubordination in a time of war is mutiny.

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:07.589
And mutiny is punishable by death
by firing squad.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:10.963
Now, this time, Peaceful's been let off lightly.

01:24:11.421 --> 01:24:13.048
Field punishment number one.

01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:15.430
Fall the men out, Sergeant.

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:17.724
Fall out!

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:26.065
Not so cocky now, are you?

01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:31.741
Soldier.

01:24:32.276 --> 01:24:33.744
Don't outdo me now.

01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:36.113
- He seemed to like you.
- Thank you.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:38.411
Thank you very much indeed. Cheers.

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:45.919
Move! Move, soldier!

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:00.145
Move it, Parsons!

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:12.445
Come on, boys.

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:16.449
Keep going! Come on, boys!

01:25:17.279 --> 01:25:18.531
Nipper!

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:21.037
Come on, boys!

01:25:34.796 --> 01:25:37.049
Fred! Fred! Pete!

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:39.510
Dig, men! Dig!

01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:42.475
Tommo! Tommo!

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:47.650
Tommo!

01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:51.568
Tommo! Tommo! Come here, lad.

01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:55.993
Come on. Come on. Come on, boy!

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:58.662
All right, come on!

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:05.662
All right. All right, all right.
It's all right, Tommo.

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:09.002
We thought we lost you, Tommo lad.

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:11.334
We're in the middle of bloody no man's land.

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:15.175
We'll get you home, Tommo.

01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:17.676
Home? We're on a bloody holiday.

01:26:17.756 --> 01:26:20.350
We've gotta get out of this, lads!

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.014
No, we can't move.

01:26:22.219 --> 01:26:23.892
Well, then we better stay put then,
hadn't we?

01:26:25.722 --> 01:26:30.853
Stay put? We're only 5O yards
from the German trenches.

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:33.902
I want all of you on your feet, now!

01:26:34.398 --> 01:26:36.400
What the hell is the matter with you lot?

01:26:36.608 --> 01:26:40.704
You send us out there, Sergeant,
watch the machine guns mow us all down.

01:26:40.779 --> 01:26:42.031
On your feet!

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:45.209
Are you disobeying my order,
Private Peaceful?

01:26:45.742 --> 01:26:48.370
Are you disobeying my order?

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:52.915
He can't walk, Sergeant, let alone run.
He's wounded!

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:55.635
I want all you men on your feet now,

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:58.297
or it's a court martial, Peaceful.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:59.632
Do you hear me?

01:27:00.257 --> 01:27:03.557
Let's go! Go! Go!

01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:06.270
I want you over the top!

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:08.307
Let's go!

01:27:16.106 --> 01:27:19.155
Fix bayonets!

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.322
Charge!

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:33.586
Fred!

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:50.933
Charlie, I have to tell you.

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:55.687
I heard about the girl.

01:27:57.355 --> 01:27:58.527
I'm sorry.

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:01.114
Her name was Anna.

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:03.991
She was lovely.

01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:07.454
But it's not her.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:09.793
I know.

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:13.129
You still have feelings for Molly.

01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:17.001
- I'll love her till the day I die.
- Tommo.

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.342
Listen.

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:22.134
I am.

01:28:23.048 --> 01:28:24.641
Father needn't have died.

01:28:27.219 --> 01:28:29.313
He was trying to save me.

01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:35.311
If only I'd have ran when he called out to me,

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:38.146
the tree wouldn't have fallen on him.

01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:40.653
He'd have lived.

01:28:42.526 --> 01:28:45.245
It was that tree that killed him, Tommo.

01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:48.369
Not you.

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:58.417
Here.

01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:02.512
I want you to have this.

01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:05.758
It's such a wonderful watch.

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:11.851
You wind it regular and time will never stop.

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:17.899
You have to promise
to look after it, though, Tommo.

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:19.362
I promise.

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:32.075
Fred?

01:29:46.381 --> 01:29:48.099
Keep going, Tommo.

01:29:48.925 --> 01:29:50.051
Come on, Charlie.

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:24.798
Hanley.

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:42.525
Shoot him. Kill the bastard!

01:30:42.854 --> 01:30:44.276
He'll put Tommo on charge.

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:45.608
Go on!

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:25.989
Left, right, left, right, left!

01:31:26.064 --> 01:31:28.658
Left, right, left, right!

01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:30.201
Halt!

01:31:30.694 --> 01:31:33.664
Escort, two paces to the rear. March!

01:31:37.075 --> 01:31:39.874
I, Major Fitzpatrick,
convene this field general court martial

01:31:39.995 --> 01:31:44.206
to try the case of
cowardice in the face of the enemy

01:31:44.207 --> 01:31:45.675
against Private Peaceful.

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.595
He disobeyed my orders, sir,

01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:51.514
the order from High Command,
to press home the attack.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:58.013
Peaceful, you're a worthless man.

01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:00.352
Worthless.

01:32:02.017 --> 01:32:03.564
This field general court martial finds

01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:06.188
the accused, Private Peaceful,
guilty as charged.

01:32:06.271 --> 01:32:08.694
- Take away the prisoner.
- Sir!

01:32:09.065 --> 01:32:10.863
Escort, attention!

01:32:34.299 --> 01:32:35.596
Charlie.

01:32:41.639 --> 01:32:43.937
I can't stop thinking of home.

01:32:45.977 --> 01:32:48.400
Mother, Big Joe.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.403
- Molly.
- Molly.

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:52.279
Little Tommo.

01:32:58.448 --> 01:32:59.574
Will they know?

01:33:00.450 --> 01:33:02.123
They'll know.

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:04.913
They'll know.

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:09.009
No tears, Tommo lad.

01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:14.760
No tears.

01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:33.110
Both brothers were charged,
both were imprisoned.

01:33:33.111 --> 01:33:35.985
So why bring only one of them to trial, sir?

01:33:35.986 --> 01:33:37.908
Shouldn't both cases be dismissed?

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:41.954
We cannot have soldiers disobeying orders
in the face of the enemy.

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:45.337
I must pass the maximum sentence,
then the final decision is for the General.

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:47.421
And Haig could show mercy.

01:33:47.914 --> 01:33:50.963
Then why bother
to recommend the firing squad, sir?

01:33:51.084 --> 01:33:52.961
I'm not recommending it.
I'm bound by the Army Act.

01:33:53.086 --> 01:33:54.804
You blame the government.

01:33:54.963 --> 01:33:57.506
This army runs on strict discipline.

01:33:57.507 --> 01:33:59.475
But we're not inhuman.

01:34:46.055 --> 01:34:47.181
Carry on.

01:34:56.983 --> 01:34:58.701
An hour is all we give him?

01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:01.033
One hour for a man's life?

01:35:41.945 --> 01:35:44.573
General Haig has confirmed the sentence.

01:35:44.697 --> 01:35:49.248
"Private Peaceful will be shot for cowardice
in the face of the enemy"

01:35:49.369 --> 01:35:53.090
"at 6:00 on the morning
of the 25th of June, 1916."

01:36:02.966 --> 01:36:04.593
Firing party!

01:36:05.385 --> 01:36:07.558
Attention!

01:36:12.058 --> 01:36:13.275
Present!

01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:17.946
Ready!

01:36:20.233 --> 01:36:21.485
Aim!

01:36:28.074 --> 01:36:29.246
Fire!

01:37:01.107 --> 01:37:02.324
Parade,

01:37:04.277 --> 01:37:06.371
fall out!

01:37:28.509 --> 01:37:31.479
I said fall out.

01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:16.228
Tommo, wait for us.

01:38:25.191 --> 01:38:28.610
They say there's gonna be an almighty push.

01:38:28.611 --> 01:38:31.865
We'll push them away from the Somme
all the way back to Berlin.

01:38:33.032 --> 01:38:35.581
I will survive somehow, Charlie.

01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:36.918
I must.

01:38:39.038 --> 01:38:41.086
I have promises to keep.
