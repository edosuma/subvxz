WHAT IT DID
TO A MAN'S EGO

29:21.750 --> 29:23.792
TO LOSE
A BASKETBALL GAME.

THIS IS ABOUT--SEX?

OR BECAUSE I'M--
I'M DIFFERENT.

40:13.500 --> 40:18.250
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES IT FEELS
LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE HERE

40:18.250 --> 40:20.708
IS JUST
ONE GREAT BIG DETENTION
THAT I CAN'T ESCAPE,

40:20.708 --> 40:25.875
BUT...BUT THEN
I THINK ABOUT YOU...

40:25.875 --> 40:28.542
AND HOW I'VE MET
THIS--THIS GREAT GUY

40:28.542 --> 40:31.166
WHO'S SO ROMANTIC
AND SO CARING,

40:31.166 --> 40:32.834
AND WHO I LIKE,

40:32.834 --> 40:36.041
AND WHO I WANT SO MUCH.

40:38.208 --> 40:41.542
DAWSON, IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU
THAT I GET THROUGH
THE BAD DAYS.

40:41.542 --> 40:44.208
AND IF YOU THINK
THAT I WANT YOU TO BE

40:44.208 --> 40:47.250
SOME BIG VARSITY SEX STUD,
THEN YOU'RE CRAZY.

40:47.250 --> 40:51.750
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT
TO TAKE THINGS SLOW. I DO.

40:51.750 --> 40:55.417
AND I DON'T WANT TO
PRESSURE YOU, JEN. I DON'T
WANT TO BE THAT GUY.

40:55.417 --> 40:59.208
BUT I AM HUMAN.
I HAVE HORMONES.

40:59.208 --> 41:01.792
YOU KNOW.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.625
IF I SAID THAT
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT
HAVING SEX WITH YOU,
I'D BE LYING.

41:06.708 --> 41:09.208
'CAUSE THE THOUGHT
CROSSES MY MIND...

41:09.208 --> 41:11.583
ABOUT 1,000 TIMES
A DAY.

41:11.583 --> 41:15.792
WHAT, JUST 1,000?
THAT'S NOTHING.

41:16.667 --> 41:19.542
PACEY,
I'VE BEEN A REAL JERK.

41:19.542 --> 41:22.125
AH, WHEW.

41:22.125 --> 41:24.625
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR NOSE,
ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE.

41:24.625 --> 41:27.500
I'M SORRY I CALLED YOU
OOMPA LOOMPA.

41:27.500 --> 41:29.458
IT SHOULDN'T COME
AS TOO MUCH OF A SURPRISE,

41:29.458 --> 41:31.542
SEEING AS
I'M SUCH A SCREW-UP.

41:31.542 --> 41:33.083
YOU'RE NOT A SCREW-UP.

41:33.083 --> 41:33.708
[PACEY CHUCKLES]

41:33.708 --> 41:36.625
YEAH, I AM A SCREW-UP,

41:36.625 --> 41:37.208
AND EVERYBODY HERE
KNOWS IT.

41:37.208 --> 41:40.166
BUT, UH...DAWSON,

41:40.166 --> 41:43.333
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND,
MAN.

41:43.333 --> 41:45.667
AND I DON'T WANT
TO SCREW THAT UP.

41:47.750 --> 41:51.166
WHEN DID EVERYONE BECOME
SO OBSESSED WITH SEX?

41:51.166 --> 41:53.583
AND NOW YOU, TOO,
DAWSON.

41:53.583 --> 41:55.583
IF YOU'RE WORRIED
THAT EVERYONE'S MORE
EXPERIENCED THAN YOU,

41:55.583 --> 41:57.458
YOU CAN JUST REST EASY.

41:57.458 --> 42:00.000
YOU STILL HAVE ONE FRIEND
WHO'LL PROBABLY GO
TO HER GRAVE A VIRGIN.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.875
JOEY, IT'S JUST
A MATTER OF TIME.

42:01.875 --> 42:04.667
BEFORE WHAT? BEFORE
MY BRAIN SHORT-CIRCUITS

42:04.667 --> 42:05.542
AND I START BEDDING DOWN
WITH EVERY GUY

42:05.542 --> 42:08.000
WITH A FAST CAR
AND BIG BICEPS?

42:08.000 --> 42:10.166
BEFORE YOU FIND
THE RIGHT PERSON.

42:13.834 --> 42:15.917
I HAVE.

42:18.208 --> 42:19.333
JOEY?

42:19.333 --> 42:21.333
I'M SORRY, DAWSON.
I DON'T...

42:21.333 --> 42:23.417
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

42:26.750 --> 42:28.834
LOOK, I HAVE
ALL THESE FEELINGS--

42:28.834 --> 42:30.625
THESE WEIRD FEELINGS--

42:30.625 --> 42:34.458
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY IT,
AND I CAN'T SAY IT.

42:36.750 --> 42:38.500
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR SO LONG,

42:38.500 --> 42:41.542
AND YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT ME.

42:41.542 --> 42:44.250
EVERYTHING.
AND I CAN'T EVEN SAY THIS.

42:44.250 --> 42:46.250
I CAN'T.

42:46.250 --> 42:49.125
AND I JUST FEEL...

42:49.125 --> 42:50.333
REALLY LONELY.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.375
JOEY, YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

42:52.375 --> 42:53.917
[SOBBING]
YES, I AM.

42:53.917 --> 42:55.708
I'M HERE FOR YOU.
I WAS HERE FOR YOU
IN THE SIXTH GRADE.

42:55.708 --> 42:57.041
I'M HERE FOR YOU NOW,
OK?

42:57.041 --> 43:00.375
NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
IS GONNA CHANGE THAT.
NOTHING.

43:00.375 --> 43:03.708
MAYBE IF YOU'D JUST...

43:03.708 --> 43:05.625
SAY THESE THINGS,
THEN...

43:05.625 --> 43:07.125
YOU KNOW, THEY'LL
BE OUT IN THE OPEN.

43:07.125 --> 43:10.291
YOUR FEELINGS WON'T BE
AS STRONG ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW?

43:10.291 --> 43:11.083
YOU--YOU'D BE FREE.

43:11.083 --> 43:14.125
I CAN'T.

43:14.125 --> 43:15.750
I CAN'T.

43:15.750 --> 43:18.083
'CAUSE IF I SAY
THESE THINGS,

43:18.083 --> 43:20.583
I CAN'T EVER
TAKE THEM BACK.

43:22.708 --> 43:25.750
IT'LL CHANGE EVERYTHING,
AND I CAN'T DO THAT.

43:28.583 --> 43:29.875
I CAN'T.

43:34.708 --> 43:35.417
WELL, EVERYONE...

43:35.417 --> 43:37.667
CONGRATULATIONS.

43:37.667 --> 43:38.333
YOU'VE DONE YOUR TIME.

43:38.333 --> 43:41.125
YOU CAN GO HOME NOW.
