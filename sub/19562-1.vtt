00:52.760 --> 00:54.479
Whoa!

00:55.640 --> 00:57.836
Hey! Buddy, excuse me.
I'm sorry, you're parking in my spot...

00:58.000 --> 00:59.480
Senior prank day.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.190
Yeah, but it's not a prank.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.000
You're just parking it in an assigned...

01:04.160 --> 01:05.355
That's fine. You're good.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.352
You're good. I'll find a new spot.

01:08.800 --> 01:09.995
- Fucking rent-a-cop.
- Guys!

01:10.160 --> 01:11.276
I need you to stop rocking the cart.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.470
Fuck you!

01:12.640 --> 01:13.630
I'm gonna write your names down.

01:13.840 --> 01:14.990
Well, that's not good.

01:19.160 --> 01:20.150
Whoo!

01:24.040 --> 01:25.315
Do it! Do it! Do it!

01:30.360 --> 01:32.829
This is gonna be a bad day.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.036
Oh, yeah.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.554
Wait up!

01:39.080 --> 01:40.116
Hey!

01:40.280 --> 01:41.396
Oh, fuck!

01:56.840 --> 01:58.433
You hold it right there.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.354
Now, outside my class,
I found our school's

02:01.520 --> 02:06.390
1971 championship bat in the trash can.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.115
I'm wondering who put it in there

02:10.280 --> 02:11.396
and why.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.076
We thought it'd be funny
to throw out the bat

02:14.240 --> 02:16.596
and put the computer in with porn.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.470
Put it back.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.076
Now!

02:23.600 --> 02:25.956
Now get y'all Rush Hour asses to class.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.670
Everybody!

02:32.840 --> 02:34.274
Where... Where is my mug?

02:34.440 --> 02:37.274
Why are people always taking my mug?

02:38.240 --> 02:39.913
You know, I know we're
a rough school and everything,

02:40.080 --> 02:42.197
and we don't usually have
control over the students,

02:42.360 --> 02:44.670
but this is the worst
I've ever seen the pranks.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.320
Really? I think it's hilarious.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.193
I'm thinking about
taking a shit in the pool.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.157
I want... I want to think
that you're joking.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.596
But for some reason,
I feel like you're not.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.353
I was just picturing everybody's faces.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.477
Yeah. I'm just saying
it's not a good day for this, you know?

02:57.640 --> 02:59.040
My wife was due three days ago.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.913
And I'm up all night
thinking about what I'm gonna say

03:01.080 --> 03:02.230
to the superintendent at 2:00.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.834
You know, I don't have anything planned.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.434
I know what I'm gonna say at my meeting.

03:05.680 --> 03:06.875
I'm gonna be like,

03:07.080 --> 03:09.959
"Fuck you for trying to make us
re-interview for our jobs again!"

03:10.280 --> 03:12.511
I put my blood, sweat, and tears
into my coaching.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.275
- Right.
- Not my fault we always in last place.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.879
Yeah, what... What is your record?

03:18.120 --> 03:19.600
These kids are un-coachable!

03:19.800 --> 03:21.473
It's very tough. It's very tough.

03:21.680 --> 03:24.036
Losing here is a tradition.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.629
It shouldn't be.

03:25.800 --> 03:26.995
- Yeah, it's a terrible tradition.
- Right?

03:27.160 --> 03:28.799
I'm trying my best

03:28.960 --> 03:31.350
not to get one of
these kids' moms pregnant.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.835
I'm trying.

03:33.000 --> 03:33.990
You're not gonna say that, are you?

03:34.160 --> 03:35.753
Hell no, Campbell.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.320
Be polite as shit.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.949
I went out and bought new
jeans for this motherfucker.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.839
And I hate long pants.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.719
Yeah, you got an exotic build.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.230
Fuck this!

03:45.400 --> 03:48.632
Twenty-two years and then,
"See you later!"

03:48.800 --> 03:53.397
Those assholes should have taken my class,
so they can manage a fucking budget!

03:54.320 --> 03:55.640
I'm taking this.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.190
Taking this.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.874
See? We're expendable.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.030
They fired Irv.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.429
This school's gonna fuck me?

04:02.600 --> 04:04.034
I'm gonna fuck it!

04:05.160 --> 04:06.310
Drop it!

04:07.920 --> 04:08.910
Oh, shit.

04:19.839 --> 04:20.829
Oh, fuck it!

04:29.960 --> 04:31.314
What the fuck is this?

04:32.680 --> 04:36.071
Don't have money for books,
but got money for this newfangled...

04:36.240 --> 04:38.391
He gonna fuck that coffee machine up.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.040
Is this a practical joke?

04:40.800 --> 04:42.632
Huh? You know I don't play that shit.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.877
How the fuck you work this bullshit?

04:47.960 --> 04:49.872
You. Campbell.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.910
Me?

04:52.080 --> 04:53.719
You the only one drinking coffee, right?

04:53.880 --> 04:55.030
Uh, yeah.

04:55.200 --> 04:58.591
No, I mean,
I got a light roast cappuccino.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.559
Well, get your light
roast ass over here and help me fix a cup.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.229
Right. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.790
I'm sorry, I don't know
why I was resisting that.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.111
- Yeah, so it's a new machine.
- No shit.

05:08.280 --> 05:09.270
It's state of the art, though.

05:09.440 --> 05:11.591
All you gotta do is
put in your order, and it does the rest.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.070
Coffee.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.555
You know, I'll just... I'll do it for you,
and I think that's just gonna be the easiest.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.037
Right, so you got your
drink selections down here.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.759
And flavors, you got hazelnut...

05:23.920 --> 05:25.400
I just want regular coffee.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.313
Shoot. Uh...

05:27.480 --> 05:28.914
That doesn't seem to be an option.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.356
Um...

05:30.640 --> 05:32.438
How about an Americano?
That's basically the same thing.

05:32.640 --> 05:34.791
- Whatever.
- So I just pick "Americano", right?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.350
And then you can go medium, light, dark.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.678
You look like...
Or not look like, you would want...

05:40.840 --> 05:44.038
I'll go with medium.
And then you hit "brew."

05:51.760 --> 05:53.752
And it's done.

05:53.920 --> 05:54.910
Thank God.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.191
And one Americano. For you.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.074
All right. Cheers.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.199
Tastes like shit.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.794
Fucking waste of money.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.397
Shit don't even voice activate.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.314
That was awkward.

06:14.120 --> 06:19.479
"It takes courage to grow up and to
become who you really are."

06:19.640 --> 06:21.677
Right? E.E. Cummings wrote that.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.991
And, guys, you're growing up.
You're moving on.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.631
For many of you, this is gonna be the last
English class you're ever gonna take.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.395
So, um, I want you to remember something.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.200
Words are always going to matter.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.359
Right? What?

06:35.760 --> 06:37.160
Uh-oh! Uh...

06:37.360 --> 06:39.431
Something's funnier than
it should be, right?

06:39.600 --> 06:42.035
I'm missing the joke here. Is it me?

06:42.800 --> 06:44.712
"Mr. Dick Suck's English class!"

06:44.920 --> 06:46.912
Look, I'm down for the
senior pranks, I really am,

06:47.080 --> 06:49.276
but, frankly, I think this
one's a little homophobic, right?

06:49.440 --> 06:51.750
I mean, how does everybody
think this makes Blake feel?

06:54.120 --> 06:55.713
What's that supposed to mean?

06:55.920 --> 06:57.115
Oh, uh...

06:58.840 --> 07:02.470
- I'm sorry. It doesn't mean anything.
- No, no. It means something.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.995
Words matter, remember?

07:04.400 --> 07:05.390
Right. Yeah, no.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.155
I... I just meant because
you're politically conscious

07:08.360 --> 07:10.317
and you're sensitive.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.358
I'm not sensitive.

07:12.520 --> 07:13.840
I'm gay.

07:14.360 --> 07:17.353
And I wrote it and I drew the cat.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.832
And now there's a cat. What is...

07:20.040 --> 07:21.474
What is this?

07:21.640 --> 07:23.040
Now I'm Mr. Cat?

07:23.200 --> 07:26.671
Oh, I get it. I'm Mr. Pussy
because I'm a nice guy.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.600
I'm a pushover, right?
All right, guys, come on.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.594
I'm down for the pranks,
but frankly we're getting...

07:33.120 --> 07:35.874
And "Mr. Dick Suck's English class" again!

07:36.040 --> 07:37.269
In Sharpie!

07:38.880 --> 07:42.351
And now I have Ms. Grossman
peering through the window.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.392
Uh, excuse me for one second.

07:44.560 --> 07:45.994
- I'll be right back.
- All right, Blake!

07:46.160 --> 07:47.196
Yo, Blake turned a cat into a dick.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.390
- Hey!
- Hey.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.550
- Hi.
- Hey, how's it going?

07:49.720 --> 07:51.313
Uh, what's going on?

07:51.560 --> 07:53.040
I got some news for you about your job.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.240
Oh, my God. What do you...
What do you know?

07:55.400 --> 07:57.995
Wolinsky and Henderson just got fired.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.429
- Oh, my God! That's great!
- Right? Yeah!

08:01.600 --> 08:02.716
I mean, it's terrible because...

08:02.880 --> 08:03.996
I know, 'cause they got families.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.230
Yeah, they got the families
and everything.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.392
But they're not gonna
fire the whole English department, right?

08:07.560 --> 08:08.550
Exactly. That'd be crazy!

08:08.720 --> 08:10.837
Holly, thank you! I gotta call my wife.
That's fantastic.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.675
What the fuck was that?
Where did they get a horse?

08:15.840 --> 08:17.399
They stole it from the race track.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.035
They got it all hopped up
on homemade meth, you know,

08:20.200 --> 08:21.998
so it'd be amped up enough
to run through the hallways.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.879
- Yeah.
- It's not like the best batch, but...

08:24.040 --> 08:25.554
I'm sorry...

08:26.920 --> 08:28.912
- How do you know that?
- How do I know what?

08:29.080 --> 08:31.879
Holly, you're not doing meth again, right?

08:33.039 --> 08:35.429
Yeah. Yeah, just a little bit.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.433
- Don't do meth.
- No more homemade meth. Got it.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.794
No, no. No meth, period.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.599
When I'm on my period, don't do it?

08:41.880 --> 08:42.996
That's when I need it the most.

08:43.159 --> 08:44.435
Holly, you're the guidance counselor.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.432
- You've never done it?
- Oh, God, no. No.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.751
- Oh. Man, it's fucking great.
- Yeah.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.280
- Is it?
- Yeah!

08:50.440 --> 08:51.760
I think the best I've ever felt.

08:51.920 --> 08:52.910
Holly, this stuff's gotta stop.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.196
- Right.
- Right?

08:54.360 --> 08:55.510
Yeah, 'cause it's a gateway?

08:56.080 --> 08:58.436
- It's the finish line.
- There's worse stuff.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.474
I don't think I can help you.
All right, thanks.

09:00.680 --> 09:01.670
I gotta call my wife. Thank you, Holly.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.559
All right.
I'll take care of your classroom.

09:03.720 --> 09:04.995
Ooh, ooh, no, no, no! Don't do that.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.640
- What's that?
- They're fine. Yeah.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.234
Some of them are fine.
You know what I mean?

09:08.440 --> 09:09.794
- They're good-looking.
- Uh-oh. Yeah, no.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.155
Leave 'em alone.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.589
- Right?
- Right.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.750
- But thank you for the news.
- Yeah.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.235
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.550
Yo! Neil's gonna prank Strickland today.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.712
Strickland might legit kill Neil, bro.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.997
I know. It's gonna be epic!

09:24.160 --> 09:25.799
Whoa! What's happening here?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.992
You don't just come on
my field mowing nothing.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.196
So sorry, Coach.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.033
Principal Tyler said we have to mow here.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.357
- For real?
- Yeah.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.630
Wow.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.838
Good for you. Good for you!

09:38.000 --> 09:39.832
This is a gleaming example

09:40.000 --> 09:42.469
of people doing positive things out here.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.433
Y'all can hit the track.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.077
Yvette, all of the rolling your eyes in
the world ain't gonna get you nowhere.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.514
And tell your mother she never
text me back, damn it!

09:54.160 --> 09:56.516
- Hello?
- Hey! Honey, hi! How's it going?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.672
How you feeling?
Everything good? Everything okay?

09:58.840 --> 10:01.833
Well, I feel like I'm about to explode,
we're definitely gonna be late to school,

10:02.000 --> 10:03.559
and I'm on my fourth hairdo
for the talent show.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.790
Ah.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.434
Did you have your meeting
with the superintendent yet?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.990
Not yet. But that's why I'm calling,
actually. I wanna tell you that...

10:09.160 --> 10:10.150
- Dad...
- Yeah?

10:10.320 --> 10:12.198
I really want to change
the song to Big Sean.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.716
What?

10:13.920 --> 10:16.435
She wants to change the
song to a Big Sean song.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.080
Daddy didn't learn a Big Sean song, right?

10:18.240 --> 10:19.356
Daddy learned the song from Rent.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.352
- We can do the same dance moves.
- All right, look, Ally,

10:21.520 --> 10:23.079
I know this dance is
a big deal for you, okay?

10:23.240 --> 10:25.197
And I'm not gonna let you down.

10:25.360 --> 10:28.637
But it's way too late to change the song,
sweetie. Okay?

10:28.840 --> 10:29.830
- So, let me talk to Mommy...
- Okay.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.639
'Cause I got something
really important I wanna tell her.

10:31.800 --> 10:32.790
Did you get fired?

10:32.960 --> 10:34.189
No, no, no! My job is safe.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.800
Oh, honey, that is such great news.

10:35.960 --> 10:36.996
Isn't that great?

10:37.160 --> 10:39.072
I really cannot have you
getting fired right now, okay?

10:39.280 --> 10:40.873
We can't have that right now...

10:41.200 --> 10:42.236
That would be no good.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.800
It's the hottest thing I've ever seen.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.519
You know what, sweetie?
I gotta call you back.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.239
Some... Something weird
is going on around here.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.390
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.438
Yeah. Tell Ally I'll see her at 2:30.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.716
Daddy says he'll see you at 2:30.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.910
- Bye, honey.
- All right. Bye, love.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.673
How'd it do that?

10:55.640 --> 10:58.155
Oh, I've literally never seen that before.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.197
- Oh, yeah. You want more?
- What the fuck?

11:03.720 --> 11:05.074
What the hell are you doing?

11:05.560 --> 11:07.040
Why did you open the door?

11:07.960 --> 11:09.633
You don't get to ask the questions, okay?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.154
Come on. Let's go. Get up!

11:11.320 --> 11:12.310
God!

11:12.520 --> 11:14.273
Really, I mean, you wanna
do that at home? Fine.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.398
- Are you starting again?
- Yes.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.438
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

11:18.600 --> 11:19.590
Stop this!

11:19.760 --> 11:21.319
Don't look at me and smile
when you're doing it.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.039
Just stop... Just stop doing it!

11:27.760 --> 11:29.160
Bonjour, Ms. Monet.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.391
Bonjour, messieurs.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.791
Now get your asses back to class.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.874
Stop!

11:36.040 --> 11:37.872
The time for touching penises is over.

11:38.040 --> 11:40.430
Just let me get to the end! I'm so close.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.398
How do you even still have a boner?

11:42.600 --> 11:44.671
- Pull your pants back up.
- What is going on here?

11:45.040 --> 11:47.271
Oh, hey.
That must have sounded pretty bad.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.318
Uh, let me explain.
He was just masturbating.

11:49.560 --> 11:50.550
And he was just watching.

11:50.720 --> 11:51.790
I wasn't watching. I caught you.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.758
Just get out of here before I report you.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.149
Right. Okay, let's go. Back to class.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.953
But there's no reason to report me.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.032
- Let's go.
- Get back to class.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.236
Yeah. And again, to be clear,

12:00.440 --> 12:03.319
- I was not watching him. I caught him...
- You're gross.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.556
Unbelievable.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.473
Hey, light roast.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.470
Hey.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.313
Do you know how to fix an AV system?

12:10.480 --> 12:11.470
Oh, uh...

12:11.760 --> 12:14.195
Yeah. But I'm so sorry.
I'm running late for my class.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.430
Sorry about that.

12:16.640 --> 12:17.630
Stop!

12:22.000 --> 12:24.037
Don't you take another step.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.430
One more step

12:35.600 --> 12:37.239
and you'd have been covered in paint.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.358
They've been putting 'em
all over the place.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.751
Holy crap. It's like a trip wire and...

12:46.920 --> 12:49.674
Oh, my God. You just saved me, man.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.116
Why aren't they this ambitious
with their classwork, huh?

12:52.840 --> 12:54.320
All right. You know what?
Yeah, I got a second.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.834
Let's take a look at that AV.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.791
So I'm trying to show the class
this Civil War documentary.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.275
Damn school wouldn't purchase
my Ken Burns DVDs,

13:11.440 --> 13:14.558
so I'm stuck with
this bullshit knock-off VHS.

13:14.720 --> 13:16.313
Ah, it's a bummer.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.034
Now, look. I push it in,

13:18.200 --> 13:19.475
it comes on...

13:19.640 --> 13:20.869
The troops called him Old Whittington.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.872
It plays for a minute and then...

13:23.320 --> 13:25.880
Huh! Yeah, that's really weird.

13:26.280 --> 13:28.840
Eight times, I asked for a DVD player.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.229
No response.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.914
I'm this close to going up there

13:32.120 --> 13:34.635
and going postal on the whole
goddamn administration.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.275
This close.

13:37.960 --> 13:39.394
Yikes. Yeah.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.237
Well, you know what?
Maybe you just wanna give 'em

13:42.400 --> 13:43.914
a free period and call it a day.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.880
A free period?

13:47.720 --> 13:49.200
What good would that do?

13:50.040 --> 13:53.112
Oh, you know, it's the last day of school
and I'm sure they'd like you for it,

13:53.280 --> 13:55.033
and this isn't working, so...

13:56.600 --> 13:58.273
I don't need to be liked.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.630
I need to educate.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.911
You see, half of these kids
thought the Civil War

14:04.080 --> 14:07.073
was a fight between Batman and Superman.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.636
So, we don't get free periods.
Ain't that right?

14:10.800 --> 14:13.315
No free periods
in Mr. Strickland's history class, right?

14:13.520 --> 14:14.510
Right.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.838
- Right?
- Right.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.040
Right. Good. Strong...

14:23.200 --> 14:26.113
Strong point. I'll give it another look.
Yeah, I mean if you wanna...

14:26.280 --> 14:28.351
You're gonna have to take
the manual out, because I think...

14:28.520 --> 14:29.874
All right, I'm gonna start
from the beginning.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.952
First I'm gonna power on the...

14:32.720 --> 14:34.598
- Was that you?
- No. I thought that was you.

14:34.760 --> 14:35.750
No, I didn't push the button.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.149
- That was you.
- No, that wasn't me.

14:37.320 --> 14:39.118
I'm not pushing the button yet.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.999
Are you sure you're not hitting it
by accident, or...

14:41.160 --> 14:42.276
No.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.592
You know what?
I'm gonna go down to the next step.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.514
Maybe I'll just power on the...

14:49.960 --> 14:52.031
- Farewell, you bastard.
- A-ha!

14:52.760 --> 14:54.479
I think I see what's going on here.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.316
Mr. Strickland, you are
the victim of a senior prank.

15:00.640 --> 15:02.791
Very funny, you guys. Very, very funny.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.516
I believe this young man is manipulating
the television with his cell phone.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.592
Kind of caught him out of
the corner of my eye there.

15:08.800 --> 15:09.836
He's doing this?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.434
- Yeah.
- You doing it?

15:13.000 --> 15:14.229
Give it to me.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.150
Now!

15:16.320 --> 15:17.834
You think this is funny?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.310
Messing with the TV with your
goddamn computer telephone?

15:20.520 --> 15:21.749
No, I'm not the one doing it.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.799
I'mma show you what's funny.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.709
Everybody,

15:25.880 --> 15:29.840
I want you to hashtag L-M-F-A...

15:30.520 --> 15:31.510
O!

15:31.760 --> 15:34.992
Now, there will be no more
interruptions in my class.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.190
None!

15:36.360 --> 15:39.273
We're gonna watch
this beautiful documentary

15:39.440 --> 15:40.954
on the Civil War,

15:41.120 --> 15:43.430
and it's not Tupac versus Biggie.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.677
He lost a leg at Gettysburg

15:48.880 --> 15:50.758
and an arm at Chickamauga.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.151
But his blood thirst remained unquenched.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.079
Okay. Uh...

15:55.720 --> 15:58.030
We got it going,
so I'm gonna go back to class.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.350
Hey, man. Shut up.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.319
I said no interruptions.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.472
Be a fucking example for the kids, man.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.878
It was going to be a long winter.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.160
He had to amputate his son's leg

16:09.360 --> 16:12.239
with nothing but a bayonet
and a box of matches.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.635
Families were increasingly
facing hard decisions.

16:21.160 --> 16:24.676
What the fuck?

16:34.760 --> 16:37.673
Do it.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.154
No!

16:49.960 --> 16:53.158
All right. Who did that?

16:53.360 --> 16:54.555
Who did it?

16:55.320 --> 16:57.437
Who did that?

16:59.240 --> 17:00.310
Who did it?

17:00.680 --> 17:03.639
It was you! It was you, wasn't it?
Give me that phone!

17:03.800 --> 17:06.315
I don't have one.
You just broke mine, remember?

17:06.480 --> 17:08.311
Okay. Okay.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.592
God damn it. I'm tired of this shit.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.750
Uh, I don't know what's happening.

17:17.920 --> 17:18.910
Get out of here!

17:19.119 --> 17:21.077
Oh, shit! Okay, I have the phone.
I have the phone.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.520
Remember, teachers stick together.

17:46.960 --> 17:47.996
Yeah.

17:48.760 --> 17:49.796
Okay.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.196
I don't have time for this today.

18:06.320 --> 18:10.633
I've got 30 termination
meetings today alone.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.996
Everything in my office
is glued to something else.

18:19.520 --> 18:23.833
I got drawers filled,
filled with Silly String. You see that?

18:24.040 --> 18:27.033
And I got a goddamn mariachi band
following me around wherever I go!

18:30.200 --> 18:32.510
I offered them $100
and they still won't leave.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.558
I think they thought it was a tip.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.315
And now I've got 20 students

18:37.480 --> 18:39.312
running out of a classroom in a panic.

18:39.480 --> 18:43.190
Students telling me that Neil's desk
has been smashed to pieces,

18:43.360 --> 18:45.352
presumably by a fire ax,

18:45.560 --> 18:48.394
and you're telling me
that you haven't seen anything today?

18:50.040 --> 18:51.269
Yeah.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.951
How about you, Strickland? Huh? Nothing?

18:54.120 --> 18:56.396
Like I said before, Tyler,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.754
I was too busy working out
that piece of shit VCR

18:59.920 --> 19:01.400
that this school is still using.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.916
I know you teachers all like
to stick together. I get it.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.799
But I'm having to fire whole departments.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.629
That's hard on me, too.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.277
Wait, whole departments?

19:12.440 --> 19:14.557
Yeah. Entire departments.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.913
Well, uh, I mean...

19:18.080 --> 19:21.756
Maybe the best thing
to do is talk to Neil?

19:22.280 --> 19:24.920
Oh, I did. Yeah.
Neil's not talkin' either.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.070
So, then I went back to this.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.630
I'm back to needing a straight answer
from one of you two.

19:30.280 --> 19:31.270
Right.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.199
Let me bottom-line this for you.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.198
Someone's going down for this.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.073
I'm firing one of you two today.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.115
Tell you what,
how about we'll go one better.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.313
How about I fire you both?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.154
He did it.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.076
You did it.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.993
I mean, you did do it, so...

20:00.160 --> 20:01.150
He did it.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.432
That's what happened, was you...

20:04.640 --> 20:06.120
'Cause he, you know,

20:07.800 --> 20:08.790
chopped the desk.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.713
Which you probably shouldn't have done.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.917
Did you mean to do it? Was it an accident?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.799
Or did you wanna say it was an accident?

20:14.960 --> 20:16.110
You know what it was?

20:16.360 --> 20:19.353
The technology is outdated on the VCRs.

20:19.560 --> 20:20.550
That was a great point. Yeah.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.116
And the kids were pushing
him with the pranks.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.800
They're out of control this year, sir.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.189
I've never seen anything like it, really.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.637
You know what, I think maybe
you should take that all in consideration.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.439
And maybe just, you know...

20:32.720 --> 20:33.790
Don't fire him.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.757
I am so sorry he fired you.

20:39.160 --> 20:42.153
That's such a shitty situation
he put us in.

20:42.480 --> 20:46.360
And, you know,
I feel somewhat responsible, you know.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.432
I mean, look. Hey, come 2:00 today,

20:48.640 --> 20:51.155
I might not have a job either, but, uh...

20:51.440 --> 20:55.070
You know, I got a baby due any minute,
and I can't be losing my job,

20:55.240 --> 20:57.516
so I hope you understand.

20:59.440 --> 21:01.159
I'm gonna fight you.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.070
I'm sorry, what?

21:05.520 --> 21:10.356
I am going to fight you.

21:12.360 --> 21:13.510
Are...

21:14.280 --> 21:15.350
Are you joking?

21:16.680 --> 21:19.878
Look, man, I was in a very
tight spot there, you know.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.952
Tyler really was pitting us
against each other, and...

21:22.120 --> 21:24.919
After school, you gonna
meet me in the parking lot,

21:25.080 --> 21:27.356
and we gonna handle this
shit the primitive way.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.156
With our fists.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.875
You can't be serious.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.991
I can't wait to fuck you up.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.559
Whoa. Hey...

21:37.720 --> 21:39.677
Hey, man, whoa. I...

21:39.840 --> 21:42.878
Look, I'm very sorry you lost your job,

21:43.040 --> 21:44.235
but you're talking crazy.

21:44.400 --> 21:45.516
Right? Like...

21:46.240 --> 21:47.435
You hear that that's a...

21:47.600 --> 21:49.353
I don't need this. This is... Mmm-mmm.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.469
Campbell!

21:57.200 --> 22:00.079
Parking lot. After school.

22:00.240 --> 22:01.356
It's on.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.756
Look, man, there's nothing

22:05.920 --> 22:08.116
I could've done, you know? So...

22:08.280 --> 22:11.717
I'm very sorry you lost
your job, but this is over.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.633
One man wins

22:14.600 --> 22:16.557
when the other's unconscious.

22:16.720 --> 22:20.760
Then, and only then, is it over.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.395
You really wanna have
a fist fight after school,

22:24.560 --> 22:28.076
- like we're a couple of students?
- I want everybody to see this.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.475
Teachers don't fight.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.757
We're gonna handle
our differences like real men.

22:31.960 --> 22:32.950
What differences?

22:33.240 --> 22:37.120
You got a job and I don't!
That's the fucking difference.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.396
This is a bad joke.

22:38.560 --> 22:39.994
Snitches get stitches.

22:40.160 --> 22:43.437
Snitches and stitches,
what the fuck you talking about?

22:48.480 --> 22:49.709
I can't even be there!

22:49.880 --> 22:51.951
I have a talent show thing
with my daughter.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.435
It's the last day of school.
Can't we just let this thing go?

22:57.360 --> 22:58.396
Strickland!

22:59.680 --> 23:00.750
Strickland!

23:02.400 --> 23:06.030
It takes courage, uh, to grow up

23:06.200 --> 23:07.190
and, uh...

23:08.960 --> 23:11.794
Make it the whole way.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.630
E.E. Cummings said that.

23:13.800 --> 23:17.840
And words are gonna matter for you guys.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.072
Uh, um...

23:21.960 --> 23:23.155
Yes, Nathaniel.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.391
Is it true you're gonna
fight Mr. Strickland?

23:26.400 --> 23:28.278
Wait. You've heard about this?

23:28.440 --> 23:29.840
What did you hear?

23:37.320 --> 23:41.280
Hashtag teacher fight? What is this?
You guys are tweeting about this now?

23:41.560 --> 23:43.995
Why would you agree to fight Strickland?
He could kill you.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.674
Yeah, no, guys.
I'm not gonna fight Mr. Strickland.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.718
We had a misunderstanding,

23:47.880 --> 23:49.678
and everything's gonna be just fine.

23:49.840 --> 23:52.753
I'm... I'm sorry, though.
Who else knows about this?

23:54.720 --> 23:56.518
You guys hear Strickland
is gonna fight Campbell?

23:56.680 --> 23:57.716
Yeah, he's gonna whip him bad.

23:57.880 --> 23:59.553
Without a doubt.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.194
What are you guys doing now?

24:01.640 --> 24:04.109
We just chalking the field.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.354
Well, your lines are a little off,
but I appreciate the hard work, kids.

24:07.520 --> 24:11.036
Let me tell you something. Kids your age
sometimes can turn out to be douchebags,

24:11.200 --> 24:12.714
but you guys come from good stock.

24:12.880 --> 24:13.996
Good batch of kids.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.356
Thank you, Coach.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.796
Let's go! Everybody, on the track!

24:18.960 --> 24:21.600
Clifford, stop doggin' it.
I will fuck you up.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.911
What are you doing,
challenging Strickland to a fight?

24:29.080 --> 24:31.549
- I didn't challenge him to a fight.
- This is crazy.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.120
Everybody's got a story about him.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.073
Like what? What have you...
What do you know about him?

24:35.280 --> 24:36.270
He used to be in a...

24:36.480 --> 24:38.358
Gang, right. And if anyone snitched,

24:38.520 --> 24:40.716
he's the guy you had to answer to.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.793
Please, man!

24:44.000 --> 24:45.593
I didn't mean to do... Hey...

24:45.760 --> 24:47.956
- Hey, man, don't do it, man.
- Don't do it.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.556
Saddam Hussein had
these two fucked-up evil sons,

24:50.920 --> 24:52.036
mass murderers.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.590
During the Iraq War,
Strickland killed them.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.397
You're dead. You're dead.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.400
Game's over, boys.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.353
I'll save you some next time.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.115
So I'm cleaning late at night,

25:06.600 --> 25:08.990
and I walk in on him playing piano.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.512
The dude's a virtuoso.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.393
That doesn't seem too scary.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.759
You didn't see his eyes.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.636
He was a cop,

25:28.920 --> 25:31.196
and whenever anyone
got off on a technicality,

25:31.360 --> 25:34.114
he would find them
and beat the shit out of 'em.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.596
Oh, he's gonna fuckin' kill me.

25:44.760 --> 25:45.796
Nah.

25:46.840 --> 25:47.830
Yeah.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.520
Kill for it!

25:53.120 --> 25:54.110
Guys, this is crazy, right?

25:54.320 --> 25:57.597
I mean, what kind of adult man
challenges another adult man to a fight?

25:57.760 --> 25:58.830
That's not a thing that happens anymore.

25:59.000 --> 26:03.079
Okay. All right. Why don't you just take
a punch and then just go down, you know?

26:03.240 --> 26:06.119
Play dead like you're with
a bear, or like possums do,

26:06.280 --> 26:08.192
or anything that's like a...
Like a pussy animal.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.751
I don't wanna take a punch.
I don't wanna be in a fight.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.111
He's right. He can't be taking no punches.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.270
- Right?
- No.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.590
You see those twins out there?

26:16.800 --> 26:18.314
Oh, yeah. The hot ones?

26:18.520 --> 26:20.477
The one on the left's
been playing games with me all year.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.716
Hey, hey!

26:22.160 --> 26:23.435
Hey, Nathaniel.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.389
Hey, what's up?

26:27.480 --> 26:29.676
He wants to fuck me.
He's just playing games.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.230
Yeah. You know how that story ends,
right? You've seen it on the news?

26:32.440 --> 26:34.079
Oh, with the teachers
who go for the students?

26:34.280 --> 26:35.396
Getting arrested and
going to jail for many...

26:35.560 --> 26:36.550
Yeah.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.080
The news always, like,
leaves out the good part.

26:38.320 --> 26:40.630
They never tell how the
teacher does the seduction.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.799
Right. Never mind.
What's your point with the twins?

26:42.960 --> 26:45.191
Watch this shit. Nathaniel!

26:45.840 --> 26:47.672
Give your brother 85%.

26:48.760 --> 26:49.750
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.195
Oh, shit!

26:51.360 --> 26:53.113
- Right on the Flintstone.
- That was hot.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.273
At 100%, it's a toss-up
whether the other twin gets back up.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.791
That's not good because Strickland's
definitely gonna punch me at 100%.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.839
Oh, no. He gonna punch you at 110%.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.720
At which point you won't be playing dead.
You will be dead.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.794
All right. Well, 110% is not a real thing
'cause 100 is the max that you can go.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.917
Can I get over here to elaborate with him?
Thank you.

27:12.080 --> 27:16.120
See, he's gonna be aiming for a target
in the center of your skull,

27:16.320 --> 27:19.358
which is gonna compound
the energy as it connects,

27:19.520 --> 27:21.000
which is gonna automatically scramble

27:21.200 --> 27:23.396
all the gray
and white matter in your brain

27:23.600 --> 27:28.550
that controls logic, personality,
social and sexual behavior.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.029
So at 110%?

27:30.200 --> 27:33.716
Oh, he most definitely is gonna
knock all the sex out of you.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.635
Ah, Jesus Christ.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.912
Now, maybe you'll duck and he misses.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.878
But that's a big-ass maybe.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.872
Right, but if he does, I... I'll just run.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.953
No. I never said nothing about no running.

27:46.120 --> 27:47.793
Who's you? Seabiscuit?

27:50.680 --> 27:51.750
That was a great talk.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.479
Like, so super-helpful.

27:53.640 --> 27:54.676
- Both of you, really.
- Yeah.

27:54.840 --> 27:55.910
Super-great.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.833
I'm gonna figure this out some other way.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.071
- Campbell, you know my style.
- Yeah.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.316
I drop it like it's hot,

28:01.480 --> 28:03.676
and then sometimes
I pick it up when it's cold.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.480
- My man.
- All right.

28:06.640 --> 28:08.518
I didn't understand a word of that.
I'll see ya.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.880
No!

28:30.080 --> 28:32.356
No! No!

28:33.440 --> 28:34.430
- Dude, let's go!
- Stop!

28:34.600 --> 28:35.795
Not on my watch!

28:38.160 --> 28:41.790
You guys are not allowed to leave campus.
You need the proper paperwork to leave!

28:41.960 --> 28:43.280
I make more money than you!

28:43.440 --> 28:44.954
- Mehar! Hey.
- Hey.

28:45.160 --> 28:46.355
I need some help with something.

28:46.520 --> 28:47.954
Mr. Strickland was fired today,

28:48.160 --> 28:50.072
and I noticed that his car is still here.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.632
Well, technically, he has until the end
of school day to vacate school grounds.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.473
This is embarrassing.
He's challenged me to a fight.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.836
So I'm in an unsafe situation here.

28:58.480 --> 29:00.676
Oh, that sucks. He's gonna win.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.594
- Flex.
- I'm not gonna flex.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.598
- Flex.
- Fine.

29:05.080 --> 29:06.673
- Flex.
- I am flexing.

29:07.360 --> 29:08.350
There's nothing there.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.670
All right, look, come on. This is...

29:09.840 --> 29:11.240
- This is the problem.
- It is a problem.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.278
Can you get him out of here or what?

29:13.560 --> 29:16.314
Well, if it's going to occur after school,
then it's not really my jurisdiction

29:16.520 --> 29:19.513
because I'm the school security guard
and not the world security guard.

29:19.680 --> 29:20.670
Oh, come on, man...

29:20.840 --> 29:22.877
I don't, like, try and stop
terrorist attacks or...

29:23.040 --> 29:24.394
I'm just asking you to do your job here.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.997
You're asking me to do the job of security
guard after 3:00, when I'm not...

29:28.200 --> 29:30.157
So you're telling me that
there's nothing you can do?

29:30.520 --> 29:31.874
I could do CPR.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.311
I could potentially revive
you after he renders you unconscious.

29:34.480 --> 29:36.949
But again,
only if it's during school hours.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.349
- Yeah. Okay. Look.
- Yeah.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.874
If it's after school hours,

29:40.040 --> 29:43.033
you're just gonna lay there
all night until 7:00 a.m.,

29:43.200 --> 29:44.600
when I'll come and save your life.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.520
Shit. All right.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.473
You cussed. I'm gonna write you up!

29:48.680 --> 29:50.717
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit,

29:50.880 --> 29:52.109
shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.509
Ronald?

29:55.880 --> 29:59.191
I heard you challenged
Mr. Campbell to a fist fight.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.390
Why?

30:00.560 --> 30:02.597
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

30:02.760 --> 30:04.479
Well, I disagree.

30:06.080 --> 30:07.116
Why is that?

30:07.320 --> 30:09.551
Your fist isn't going
to solve the problem.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.393
You need a knife.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.718
This man is a pervert.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.480
Simply punching him is not enough.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.878
You need to cut him

30:28.440 --> 30:30.079
from his forehead

30:30.840 --> 30:33.230
all the way down to his chin.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.276
Damn, lady.

30:36.280 --> 30:37.509
I got this.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.515
Very well.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.029
That bitch crazy.

30:46.520 --> 30:49.319
Okay, Neil, so I think
if you talk to Principal Tyler

30:49.560 --> 30:51.199
and just kind of reverse that story,

30:51.360 --> 30:52.874
everything will get worked out.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.517
So you want me to say
I just made the whole thing up?

30:57.480 --> 30:58.596
Yeah.

30:59.360 --> 31:00.714
Why would I do that?

31:00.960 --> 31:03.839
Well, because this is all your fault.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.354
How? You're the one who tattled.

31:05.960 --> 31:09.192
I was in a very compromising situation.
You would've done the same exact thing.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.875
I was in the exact same situation
and did the opposite thing.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.670
It's not the same exact situation, Neil,
because you don't have a wife and kids,

31:14.880 --> 31:16.394
so you don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.234
Listen... I...

31:18.800 --> 31:20.473
Come on, man, you gotta help me out here.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.474
Look, this has been a huge day
for me, Mr. Campbell.

31:23.640 --> 31:25.871
Do you know how many hits we've
got on the newspaper website?

31:26.040 --> 31:28.316
I mean, even kids who go to
Churchill are reading about this.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.949
This is what I'm trying to
fucking avoid here, Neil.

31:31.920 --> 31:34.515
People are going to get hurt.
I'm going to get...

31:34.800 --> 31:35.950
Neil, come on.

31:36.160 --> 31:39.073
Buddy, let's do the right thing here.
All right?

31:40.960 --> 31:42.633
Okay. Fine.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.080
MacBook Pro.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.155
I'm sorry, what?

31:49.440 --> 31:51.716
I'll do it for a MacBook Pro.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.599
Are you trying to blackmail me?

31:56.760 --> 31:58.513
Want me to lie for you or not?

31:59.680 --> 32:02.680
Hey, buddy, let's get one thing straight.
I'm still a teacher at this school, okay?

32:02.840 --> 32:03.830
Are you?

32:04.000 --> 32:05.912
Yes! I could get you in
a lot of trouble, Neil. Okay?

32:06.080 --> 32:08.515
How would you like it if I talked to your
faculty advisor about this?

32:08.680 --> 32:11.115
My faculty advisor's Mr. Strickland.

32:12.880 --> 32:13.996
God damn it.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.839
You know, with the AppleCare, too.

32:16.000 --> 32:16.990
Yeah?

32:21.000 --> 32:22.116
I'll see you later, Mr. Campbell.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.270
Okay.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.596
What a day.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.880
How can I help you?

32:41.080 --> 32:43.072
One MacBook Pro, please.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.516
Okay.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.559
Okie-dokie. Got it.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.040
Andy?

32:51.960 --> 32:53.713
- Hey!
- Hey!

32:54.040 --> 32:55.713
- What?
- I know! What are you...

32:55.880 --> 32:57.360
What is this?

32:57.520 --> 32:59.113
Why are you guys here?
Why aren't you in school?

32:59.280 --> 33:00.873
Oh, I pulled her from P.E.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.594
We had to get a new outfit
for the talent show.

33:02.760 --> 33:04.672
Apparently the old one wasn't good enough.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.718
But, honey, why are you here?

33:06.920 --> 33:08.593
It's 11:30. Shouldn't you be in class?

33:08.880 --> 33:10.075
Is it 11:30?

33:10.240 --> 33:13.392
Yeah, usually I have class now,
but I think...

33:13.640 --> 33:15.438
Uh, yeah, I...

33:15.680 --> 33:16.796
Wait.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.640
Did you lose your job?

33:19.040 --> 33:20.030
No. What?

33:20.240 --> 33:21.674
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.911
I knew that you wouldn't
stand up to these people. I just knew it.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.196
- I knew it.
- Wait, I'm sorry, what do you mean,

33:25.440 --> 33:26.794
you knew I wouldn't stand up to them?

33:26.960 --> 33:27.950
That came out wrong.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.430
What I'm saying is that, you know, sometimes,
you just let people push you around.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.590
- I do?
- It's... Yeah.

33:31.760 --> 33:32.989
- It's just your thing.
- I have a thing?

33:33.160 --> 33:34.674
Well, yeah. You're... You're the nice guy,

33:34.840 --> 33:37.196
and then people are like,
"Hey, I'm gonna stomp on that guy."

33:37.360 --> 33:39.238
You're spinning out, okay?
Everything really is okay.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.516
I don't know why you don't believe me.

33:40.680 --> 33:41.750
Just 'cause you're
acting kinda nervous and...

33:41.920 --> 33:43.195
Well, you caught me off guard!

33:43.360 --> 33:44.555
You're a little shifty, Daddy.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.155
Why are you here, Andy?

33:46.320 --> 33:48.551
Yeah, Daddy, why are you here?

33:50.400 --> 33:51.834
Uh...

33:52.080 --> 33:53.799
Buying your mom a computer.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.193
Stop it right now.

33:56.360 --> 33:57.430
Yeah, it was supposed to be a surprise...

33:57.600 --> 34:00.160
What? Honey, this is a MacBook!

34:00.320 --> 34:01.834
- Pro.
- Pro?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.992
- With AppleCare.
- This is the most expensive one!

34:04.160 --> 34:06.038
It's the most expensive one!

34:06.200 --> 34:08.668
And you insisted on us
getting the cheaper one not too long ago.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.275
- I don't know what I was thinking!
- I don't either.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.472
Because technology's always changing.
You gotta keep up.

34:13.639 --> 34:17.074
Otherwise, you're one of those dumb
families that doesn't have a MacBook Pro.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.310
I ruined the surprise.

34:18.480 --> 34:19.469
Now, let's talk about you.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.838
Why are you changing the song
and wanting to change your outfit?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.480
Tell your daddy.

34:24.639 --> 34:25.994
Remember Trisha?

34:26.400 --> 34:27.389
Yeah, sure.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.597
She's been making fun of me all year.

34:29.800 --> 34:33.675
And now she's saying it's lame
I'm doing a dance from Rent with my dad.

34:34.199 --> 34:37.716
That's not a lame thing.
You know what? Look, Trisha's lame.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.560
No, she's not.

34:39.760 --> 34:41.592
She always wins the talent show.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.315
Maybe you'll win the talent show. Right?

34:44.480 --> 34:46.152
I've been practicing all the moves!

34:46.320 --> 34:48.072
- Oh!
- You know what I mean? I got them down!

34:48.320 --> 34:50.630
I'm not gonna let you down. Right? Okay?

34:50.800 --> 34:51.949
And see, there's the smile I need!

34:52.120 --> 34:54.112
- See, now you're happy and you're happy.
- I am.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.310
Let's get you back to school.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.960
- Okay. Bye, Daddy. I love you.
- I love you, too.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.430
Everybody stop worrying
and panicking, and get going.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.670
- Come on, go!
- Thank you!

35:00.840 --> 35:03.912
A-get, get, get, get, get, get.

35:07.840 --> 35:08.830
Hi.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.196
Hey. Back so soon?

35:10.360 --> 35:12.511
- Yeah, I'm gonna need another one.
- Okay.

35:12.680 --> 35:16.117
Oh, and do you mind spreading this
one around a little bit?

35:16.280 --> 35:17.270
Yeah.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.316
Hey, man, did you hear
about this teacher fight?

35:21.320 --> 35:22.800
It's gonna be fuckin' awesome.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.715
Fuck me.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.633
Hey, what is that? Baby oil?

35:30.800 --> 35:32.553
Hey, stop... Stop that.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.070
Hey!

35:36.400 --> 35:40.713
Twenty-two years of this
motherfucking high school!

35:40.880 --> 35:44.556
So, uh, the truth is,
I was mad at Mr. Strickland

35:44.720 --> 35:48.839
because he'd given me
a bad, but fair grade

35:49.040 --> 35:50.235
- on my last test.
- Yeah.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.074
And, you know, he never
lashed out at me or anything like that.

35:53.240 --> 35:54.230
No.

35:54.400 --> 35:58.110
And my desk broke because
I was leaning on it.

35:58.280 --> 36:00.875
You leaned on it,
and then you blamed the teacher.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.076
Unbelievable.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.640
- Yeah.
- Unbelievable.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.952
And Mr. Strickland got in a
lot of trouble because of you.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.150
Whew!

36:09.600 --> 36:13.116
You know this completely contradicts
your statement, right, Campbell?

36:13.760 --> 36:15.911
Look, we can get caught up
in the whole statement game.

36:16.080 --> 36:19.073
Who said what and what they
meant by what they said,

36:19.280 --> 36:21.749
and what words mean when people say them,

36:21.920 --> 36:24.913
and, you know, who's making
a statement and what the statement means,

36:25.120 --> 36:28.716
and whose statement has something to do
with something that someone else says.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.678
And, see, statements get...

36:30.840 --> 36:32.240
You know? And then...

36:32.400 --> 36:34.119
You said he chopped it with a fucking ax.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.794
Yeah, I know I said
the chopping thing, didn't I?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.400
Yeah. But you know what?

36:37.560 --> 36:39.119
I was looking at the AV system,

36:39.280 --> 36:40.919
and I heard the crash
and, you know, I did...

36:41.080 --> 36:43.720
You know how when you do one of
these and you're like, "Oh, my God."

36:43.880 --> 36:46.270
And then your hands are
flying in front of your face,

36:46.440 --> 36:48.955
and, like, that can look like chopping.

36:49.320 --> 36:51.676
But you were right there.
He had the best view

36:51.840 --> 36:52.876
- of his own seat.
- Yeah.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.795
So, forget my statement
'cause I wasn't in the right...

36:56.960 --> 36:58.440
- It was chaotic.
- It was chaotic. Yeah.

36:58.600 --> 37:03.311
And shame on you because we have been
through an ordeal over all of this.

37:03.480 --> 37:06.154
You should have
come out and said that in the first place.

37:06.320 --> 37:07.310
- So...
- He's right.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.637
Yeah, so there you have it.

37:17.480 --> 37:20.075
All right, I guess
if that's your statement,

37:20.240 --> 37:21.469
we got no issue with Strickland.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.280
I'll tell him he can keep his job for now.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.159
Oh!

37:26.440 --> 37:28.671
Sir, thank you so much.
That is fantastic news.

37:28.840 --> 37:30.160
I wouldn't get too happy, Campbell.

37:30.320 --> 37:33.280
Because you're still under review, and
you put me through a lot of shit today.

37:34.480 --> 37:35.516
Okay. Yeah, okay.

37:35.680 --> 37:36.875
Now, here's my statement.

37:37.040 --> 37:38.872
Get the fuck out of my office
and don't come back today.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.794
Okay, yeah. Let's get out
of here on these terms.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.474
Thank you again, for the...

37:46.800 --> 37:48.393
Are you kidding me?

37:50.360 --> 37:51.350
- Hey!
- Hey.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.432
Hi. Oh, my God. How you feeling?

37:53.600 --> 37:55.398
Please tell me it's not a student.
Is it a student?

37:55.560 --> 37:56.789
No. I'm not actually pregnant.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.312
No, I would never sleep with a student.

37:59.760 --> 38:01.194
- Good.
- Without protection.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.198
By the way, did that twin
say anything to you about me?

38:05.560 --> 38:07.358
No. He doesn't talk to me
about you at all.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.556
- Yeah.
- Okay.

38:08.760 --> 38:10.717
You know why? He's dating a cheerleader.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.000
Games.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.879
I think it's because you're
20 years older than him.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.078
But in bed,
it's like numbers don't matter.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.640
Except for the number of pumps.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.837
What? I'm sorry. You count pumps?

38:22.040 --> 38:23.440
I like stats.

38:23.720 --> 38:24.836
That's crazy.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.038
Hmm. Isn't it weird, though?

38:27.240 --> 38:28.959
- How, like, we're at work...
- Yeah.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.594
We're just, like,
seeing these kids grow up

38:30.760 --> 38:34.037
and then one day it's just like, bam,
they're 18 and you can fuck 'em.

38:35.240 --> 38:36.230
No.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.676
- How that's just, like, a thing?
- It's really not a thing.

38:38.840 --> 38:41.036
Or how they're like, "Slow down!

38:41.200 --> 38:42.190
"Don't run in the hallways."

38:42.360 --> 38:44.238
- Yeah.
- And then you're like,

38:44.520 --> 38:46.239
- "Do you have a condom?"
- Creeping on them and trying to...

38:46.400 --> 38:48.756
I want that teenage dick, you know?
I want that teenis.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.559
Holly, why are you texting me
that you're pregnant?

38:50.760 --> 38:51.750
I... I gotta be in class.

38:51.920 --> 38:55.357
Can you just wait one second?
'Cause it's all gonna make sense.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.280
- What's going on?
- Here we go.

38:57.480 --> 38:58.470
- Who raped you?
- No, no, no.

38:58.640 --> 38:59.630
Campbell, did you rape this woman?

38:59.840 --> 39:00.830
Whoa, whoa! What?

39:01.000 --> 39:02.992
I 911 texted him. There's been no rape.

39:03.360 --> 39:04.430
Thank you for your bravery.

39:04.600 --> 39:05.590
Well, what's going on?

39:05.760 --> 39:07.240
What the fuck is going on?
That's a great question.

39:07.400 --> 39:11.553
Okay, I'm sorry for misleading you both,
but this is a mediation.

39:12.120 --> 39:13.270
Said that like American Idol.

39:13.440 --> 39:14.430
- A mediation?
- Yeah.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.273
No. Doesn't matter. Don't need it, okay?

39:16.520 --> 39:19.479
Because I... I got you your job back.

39:20.600 --> 39:21.954
You did what?

39:22.440 --> 39:25.433
Yeah. I talked to Principal Tyler
and we worked it out.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.638
So, your job is safe, and...
And we're all good here now.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.390
You should've talked to me
before you did that.

39:34.680 --> 39:35.716
Oh. Uh...

39:36.120 --> 39:38.077
Okay. Sorry about that.
I didn't realize you felt that way,

39:38.240 --> 39:40.038
but look, hey,
consider it a nice surprise.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.236
So, we're good.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.760
You're such a little coward.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.240
Yeah, you are a pussy.

39:44.440 --> 39:46.796
You can't even ask a man
a simple question.

39:47.600 --> 39:48.716
Hey, I thought you'd be happy.

39:48.880 --> 39:49.870
Ask the man a question.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.030
Yeah, I could put it in question form.

39:51.240 --> 39:52.959
- Do you want your job back?
- No!

39:53.720 --> 39:55.916
I'm done with this place,
and I woulda told you that

39:56.120 --> 39:58.351
if you weren't
in my goddamn business again.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.000
Let's watch out for gun fingers.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.230
I'm confused on one thing here.

40:01.800 --> 40:02.790
You don't want your job?

40:03.000 --> 40:03.990
No.

40:06.880 --> 40:09.839
Then why the fuck are you trying to
pick a fight with me, man?

40:10.000 --> 40:12.834
And why did I just spend thousands of
dollars buying two MacBook Pros?

40:13.000 --> 40:15.515
I don't know why you do half
the shit you do, Campbell.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.074
Okay, we're yelling too much!

40:17.240 --> 40:18.515
We're yelling at each other too much.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.670
Yeah. No shit!

40:19.840 --> 40:21.672
It's not going well right now, you guys.

40:21.840 --> 40:23.115
- It's not going well at all.
- No.

40:23.280 --> 40:26.273
This is why I'm here, okay?
I'm a guidance counselor.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.709
So use me! All right?

40:27.960 --> 40:29.110
Let's take a seat.

40:29.320 --> 40:31.676
- Are we walking towards the seats?
- He doesn't want the...

40:31.840 --> 40:34.071
Yeah, but if you don't want the job,
what is the...

40:34.280 --> 40:36.670
Kill the motherfucker today.
I swear to God.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.434
Okay, so right off the bat,

40:39.600 --> 40:42.798
I'm noticing that Campbell,
you're sitting at Israel.

40:43.360 --> 40:45.397
And Strickland, you've chosen Iran.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.957
Okay, I'm wondering
if that's maybe sending a hostile message.

40:49.120 --> 40:51.351
You know, if we can get you
to an ally country, you know,

40:51.520 --> 40:54.877
Italy or Spain or France.

40:55.040 --> 40:56.269
North Korea.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.833
That's a choice. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:59.320 --> 41:01.198
Campbell, do you wanna find an ally?

41:01.360 --> 41:02.589
Holly, I'm gonna move past this.

41:02.760 --> 41:06.640
Okay? Look... I'm sorry you don't want
your job back, but I did my part.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.154
I made things right, okay?

41:08.400 --> 41:09.880
So, the fight is off.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.590
Okay, Campbell feels that
the fight should be off.

41:12.760 --> 41:13.796
Strickland, how do you feel?

41:13.960 --> 41:16.350
- No, the fight is still on.
- Strickland feels the fight is still on.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.034
Yeah, no shit!
I can hear the man speaking.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.879
- All right.
- Look, why?

41:20.480 --> 41:22.870
Because actions have consequences,

41:23.080 --> 41:25.800
and everybody around here
seem to forget about that.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.438
These students,
they shit on this school all day

41:29.760 --> 41:31.797
and don't nobody do nothing.

41:32.520 --> 41:35.558
Little kids, they come in last place,

41:35.760 --> 41:38.514
and pussies like you,
you wanna give 'em a trophy.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.239
I say fuck a trophy.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.756
Nobody's being held accountable anymore.

41:44.920 --> 41:46.593
So, I'mma hold you accountable.

41:47.680 --> 41:51.594
Yeah, you ratted on me.
Now you got to pay the price.

41:52.920 --> 41:57.358
I'mma kick yo' ass at the end of the day
in front of everybody.

41:58.480 --> 42:01.439
And you can consider this my final lesson.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.877
Yeah, you guys should fucking fight.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.997
This is crazy, you know?

42:11.160 --> 42:14.039
Do you hear yourself?
I mean, you've become unhinged!

42:15.360 --> 42:16.714
Maybe.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.553
But let me tell you something.

42:19.320 --> 42:21.630
You don't show up
to that fight this afternoon,

42:22.480 --> 42:26.076
an unhinged man might wanna
do something real nasty to you.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.959
An unhinged man might show up

42:28.120 --> 42:30.680
at your house with
a year's supply of duct tape.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.479
Pop out the bushes.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.916
Gut your ass like a fish.

42:36.680 --> 42:39.639
I could take my revenge anytime, anywhere.

42:43.960 --> 42:45.633
See you after school.

42:48.640 --> 42:49.994
Booty kick!

42:55.760 --> 42:56.876
Nine-one-one. What's your emergency?

42:57.040 --> 42:58.918
Yes, hi.
There's a crazy guy at my high school.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.070
He's trying to beat me up.

43:00.240 --> 43:01.879
Nine-one-one is for emergencies only.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.549
If you have a problem with a bully,
I need you to speak to a teacher.

43:04.720 --> 43:06.791
No... I am a teacher.

43:07.680 --> 43:08.670
Excuse me?

43:08.840 --> 43:12.752
It's actually another teacher
who's gonna beat me up after school,

43:12.920 --> 43:14.149
- so that's why I'm calling.
- I'm sorry,

43:14.360 --> 43:16.113
can you repeat what you just told me?

43:16.320 --> 43:17.356
Okay.

43:17.520 --> 43:20.797
My name is Andrew Campbell.
I'm a teacher at Roosevelt High School.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.314
There's another teacher here

43:22.480 --> 43:24.676
who wants to have
a fist fight with me after school.

43:24.840 --> 43:26.513
So, I need help.

43:29.680 --> 43:32.639
Oh, very funny! Assault is a real thing.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.834
I would like you to stop
laughing and listen to my...

43:37.000 --> 43:39.356
You're a grown man.
Now go on and take that ass-whoopin'.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.113
I'm asking you for help and...

43:48.120 --> 43:50.112
Fuck!

44:00.640 --> 44:02.233
It takes courage...

44:02.840 --> 44:04.399
To become...

44:05.880 --> 44:08.236
People when you're older.

44:09.360 --> 44:12.319
And words are...

44:14.360 --> 44:15.953
Use... Useless.

44:16.360 --> 44:17.589
Apparently.

44:17.880 --> 44:18.870
Uh...

44:20.280 --> 44:23.591
Guys, you know,
look, you try to be a nice guy, right?

44:23.800 --> 44:26.759
And treat everyone with respect,
but you don't get it.

44:26.920 --> 44:28.070
You don't get it back in return.

44:28.240 --> 44:30.755
You know why?
'Cause nice guys, they finish last.

44:30.920 --> 44:31.910
Yeah.

44:32.080 --> 44:35.118
Everything is fucked up.
This is a fucked up school,

44:35.360 --> 44:38.000
filled with lunatic teachers!

44:39.440 --> 44:41.477
Your teachers are fucking nuts!

44:41.640 --> 44:43.074
Man, this is fucked up.

44:43.280 --> 44:44.316
He's having a breakdown.

44:44.520 --> 44:45.670
- We can't prank him.
- Shh!

44:45.840 --> 44:49.470
And you're gonna say,
"Hey, I'm a nice guy. I'm doing okay."

44:49.640 --> 44:52.474
And the world is gonna
unzip its pants, pull them down,

44:52.640 --> 44:55.758
and take a giant fucking shit
all over you guys.

44:56.440 --> 44:57.954
I just can't win, guys!

44:58.120 --> 44:59.315
I cannot win.

44:59.480 --> 45:00.630
Why is there rope around my feet?

45:10.560 --> 45:13.917
Motherfucking little
motherfucking sons of bitches!

45:14.680 --> 45:16.160
This ain't right.

45:16.320 --> 45:18.471
Playing pranks used to be fun.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.871
This shit is getting violent.

45:21.040 --> 45:23.430
I look like a fucking minion!

45:23.600 --> 45:25.478
Holy cow! They got both of you, huh?

45:25.640 --> 45:26.676
Man, I gotta get pranked.

45:26.840 --> 45:27.830
All right, you know what?

45:28.000 --> 45:29.719
I'm fucking done with this shit.

45:29.880 --> 45:31.633
Yeah. I really am.

45:31.800 --> 45:34.190
No more Mr. Nice Guy, right?

45:34.360 --> 45:37.751
No more playing by the rules
like a stupid little bitch,

45:37.960 --> 45:40.992
who didn't realize everyone else in the
school threw the rulebook out years ago.

45:41.400 --> 45:42.390
All right?

45:42.560 --> 45:44.995
Strickland wants to fuck with me,
and the kids want to fuck with me.

45:45.160 --> 45:46.594
Everyone wants to fuck with me.
Guess what though?

45:46.800 --> 45:48.154
Campbell's gonna fuck right back.

45:48.320 --> 45:49.515
Yeah, let's get laid.

45:50.120 --> 45:51.554
I'm trying to...

45:51.720 --> 45:53.677
I'm trying to explain that I'm gonna...

45:53.840 --> 45:55.240
Holly, shut up!

45:55.920 --> 45:57.513
Shut the fuck up! You're always...

46:01.160 --> 46:02.389
I'm sorry.

46:03.720 --> 46:04.790
I lashed out.

46:05.160 --> 46:06.355
This has not been a good day.

46:06.760 --> 46:07.989
So here's what I'm gonna do.

46:09.280 --> 46:11.397
I'm gonna frame Strickland
for a crime he didn't commit.

46:11.560 --> 46:13.791
Wait. What? You're gonna do what?

46:14.000 --> 46:15.673
Something occurred to me
as I was getting dragged down

46:15.840 --> 46:17.433
a flight of stairs by a horse on meth.

46:18.280 --> 46:21.034
I get some meth, right?
I stick it in his classroom or some shit.

46:21.200 --> 46:23.476
I tip off the cops, they show up,

46:23.640 --> 46:25.040
and then boom! They arrest him.

46:25.200 --> 46:26.520
And I'm not gonna be in a fight today.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.518
Hey! Maybe I won't be in a fight ever

46:28.720 --> 46:30.632
'cause I don't know what kinda
past record this guy has.

46:30.800 --> 46:33.918
Yes. Yes, I fucking love this plan.
Let's do it! Yes!

46:34.080 --> 46:36.072
Okay. Right? See? Good! Holly's with me.

46:36.280 --> 46:38.920
I wouldn't tangle with no police.
I'm from the streets.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.231
You do not go to no cops, okay?

46:41.440 --> 46:45.593
You might have to just man up
and throw down with this dude.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.390
Come on, Coach. I can't fight him.
You said it yourself.

46:48.560 --> 46:49.960
I don't know, Campbell.

46:50.160 --> 46:52.550
I don't know. Maybe I was wrong.

46:52.720 --> 46:56.111
You're so pissed off right now,
you might even win.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.712
You really think I could win?

46:58.920 --> 47:00.320
Tell you something.

47:00.480 --> 47:02.073
All it takes is one punch.

47:02.240 --> 47:04.630
All right. I just... I just don't know
the first thing about fighting.

47:05.560 --> 47:07.040
Make a fist.

47:07.320 --> 47:09.198
- Come on! Make a fist!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

47:14.680 --> 47:15.955
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.713
This the fucking 1700s?

47:17.880 --> 47:19.280
I don't know! I...

47:19.480 --> 47:20.470
Get your fists up.

47:20.680 --> 47:23.593
Protect yourself before
you get punched in the head!

47:23.800 --> 47:25.200
All right. Like how? Show me how!

47:27.080 --> 47:28.070
- Fuck!
- What?

47:28.280 --> 47:29.270
What the fuck was that?

47:29.440 --> 47:31.079
Was that too hard? 'Cause it felt awesome.

47:31.280 --> 47:32.919
Punched me right in my fucking ear.

47:33.120 --> 47:35.794
- Ah! Shit! Why did you do that?
- 'Cause you said, "Like how?"

47:35.960 --> 47:37.394
When he was talking about
getting hit in the head.

47:37.560 --> 47:38.880
I meant, "Like how do I make a fist?"

47:39.080 --> 47:40.833
Not, "Like how do I get
punched in the fucking head?"

47:41.040 --> 47:42.110
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Got it.

47:42.280 --> 47:44.590
That makes sense.
I wasn't listening to the conversation.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.831
- Yeah! No shit!
- I kind of zoned out. I was bored.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.992
God damn it.
Well, obviously I can't fight this guy.

47:49.160 --> 47:50.150
No.

47:50.720 --> 47:51.870
So, back to the meth idea?

47:52.040 --> 47:53.918
- Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
- Best shot you got.

47:54.080 --> 47:55.434
- That's all I got, right?
- Yeah.

47:55.640 --> 47:57.359
Okay, so, Holly, give me some meth.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.590
Me? Yeah, no. I don't have drugs.

48:00.880 --> 48:01.870
I thought you said you did.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.793
No, I don't do drugs at school.

48:03.960 --> 48:06.236
I do them before I come to school.

48:06.440 --> 48:09.000
Shit. All right.
Well, where am I gonna get drugs?

48:09.960 --> 48:14.159
Campbell, this is a public high school
in the United States of America.

48:14.320 --> 48:17.358
There literally could not be
a better place to buy drugs.

48:21.120 --> 48:22.315
Yes, hi. There's a crazy guy

48:22.480 --> 48:23.994
- at my high school.
- Hey. I need your help.

48:24.160 --> 48:26.755
- What's up?
- Nine-one-one is for emergencies only.

48:26.960 --> 48:28.872
- What the fuck is this?
- It's my new MacBook Pro.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.315
My name is Andrew Campbell.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.709
Andrew Campbell. Andrew Campbell.

48:31.880 --> 48:33.109
Is that my 911 call?

48:33.280 --> 48:35.317
This kid in Taiwan
made a YouTube video about it.

48:35.480 --> 48:36.630
It's so awesome!

48:36.800 --> 48:38.120
How the fuck did it get to Taiwan?

48:38.480 --> 48:40.676
Well, I don't sound like...

48:40.840 --> 48:42.160
How many hits has it got?

48:42.320 --> 48:44.073
- Now go and take that ass-whooping.
- Jesus Christ!

48:44.240 --> 48:46.038
All right, look.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

48:47.480 --> 48:49.073
I need you to sell me some drugs, okay?

48:49.680 --> 48:51.000
Sorry, I don't know anything about that.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.231
Cut the shit, all right?
Holly told me that you deal.

48:53.400 --> 48:55.710
So, let's just... You can deal with me.

48:55.880 --> 48:58.554
We'll do a drug deal.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.150
iPhone.

49:06.080 --> 49:07.196
I'm sorry, what?

49:07.400 --> 49:10.791
Look, maybe I deal, maybe I don't.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.714
I'll tell you for a new iPhone.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.349
Listen, to me you little fucking shit.

49:14.520 --> 49:17.234
I will take that iPhone, I will shove it
right up your fucking ass, okay?

49:17.400 --> 49:18.993
Stop...

49:19.200 --> 49:21.032
- Chill, dude.
- Yeah, yeah. You chill.

49:21.200 --> 49:22.190
Okay. Look, look, look.

49:22.360 --> 49:24.352
Be a good boy. Sell me some drugs.

49:24.560 --> 49:25.994
Okay. Just relax.

49:26.880 --> 49:27.870
What do you want?

49:28.240 --> 49:29.356
I don't know. Give me some...

49:29.520 --> 49:31.273
Give me some meth or something.

49:31.640 --> 49:32.994
Well, I just sell molly.

49:34.960 --> 49:36.997
Then why are you asking me
what do I want, Neil?

49:37.200 --> 49:38.190
I don't know.

49:38.360 --> 49:40.750
Okay, Neil. Sell me an eighth
of Molly or whatever it is.

49:40.920 --> 49:42.718
Do you even know what molly is?

49:42.880 --> 49:44.758
I will rip your head off of your neck.

49:45.720 --> 49:48.110
I will shit down your throat, okay?

49:49.080 --> 49:50.275
That... That's where I am right now.

49:50.440 --> 49:51.920
I'm a broken man, Neil.

49:52.560 --> 49:53.550
Hmm. Okay?

49:53.760 --> 49:55.240
- Okay, man.
- Yeah? Okay?

49:58.960 --> 50:00.280
Right here? Just like this? Jesus Christ.

50:00.440 --> 50:02.432
All right, give it to me. All right.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.350
Give me the money.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.120
Fuck you.

50:33.600 --> 50:34.636
Hello.

50:45.960 --> 50:46.950
Yikes.

50:58.120 --> 50:59.156
What the fuck is this?

51:00.640 --> 51:01.790
It's my goddamn car!

51:01.960 --> 51:04.600
Oh, shit! Fuck me. God damn!

51:07.200 --> 51:08.190
Why are you kicking it?

51:08.360 --> 51:10.158
I can't... I can't believe
what they did to your car!

51:10.320 --> 51:12.073
- Fucking monsters.
- Yeah. Fucking animals.

51:12.240 --> 51:15.153
- Fucking animals.
- Yeah, little... Little... Little animals!

51:16.600 --> 51:18.557
Right. Listen. Since I ran into you,

51:18.760 --> 51:21.912
I have to tell you,
we moved your interview back to 2:15.

51:22.200 --> 51:25.318
I actually have to go to
my daughter's elementary school

51:25.480 --> 51:29.360
to do a talent show
dance thing with her by 2:30.

51:29.560 --> 51:32.029
So you want me to accommodate
the fact that you're gonna

51:32.200 --> 51:35.637
skip out of campus in
the middle of the fucking day.

51:36.160 --> 51:38.117
Good point. Sorry, sir. Yeah.

51:38.320 --> 51:39.754
I'll make it work.

51:39.920 --> 51:41.832
Good. And could you take
your foot off my car?

51:42.000 --> 51:44.231
Yeah, right.
So, I'll be there for the appointment.

51:44.400 --> 51:45.390
I'll keep my foot on the car.

51:45.560 --> 51:46.550
No. Move your foot off my car.

51:46.720 --> 51:47.870
Can't do it.

51:48.080 --> 51:49.070
Get your foot off my fucking car!

51:49.280 --> 51:51.351
If I take my foot off,
then the kids win, sir!

51:51.520 --> 51:52.556
The kids don't give two shits.

51:52.720 --> 51:53.756
Get your foot off my fucking car.

51:53.960 --> 51:55.110
My car's already fucked up!

51:55.280 --> 51:56.839
But we have to put
our foot down on the car, sir.

51:57.000 --> 51:57.990
- Off my car!
- Okay, okay!

51:58.160 --> 52:00.277
What the fuck!
Get your God damn foot off my car!

52:00.440 --> 52:02.318
Yes, sir. The foot's coming off right now.

52:02.480 --> 52:03.880
But before it comes off,

52:04.880 --> 52:07.790
let me just explain myself here.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.873
A very important announcement.

52:10.120 --> 52:13.400
If anyone finds a two-inch penis,
please return it to Principal Tyler.

52:13.680 --> 52:14.670
It's his.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.917
You gotta be fucking shitting me.

52:17.080 --> 52:19.037
Stay tuned for more announcements.

52:24.400 --> 52:25.675
Will you guys shut the fuck up?

52:41.560 --> 52:42.914
Here we go.

52:44.360 --> 52:47.558
All right. Police are in
Strickland's classroom with Mehar.

52:48.280 --> 52:49.999
But that dog ain't finding shit.

52:50.160 --> 52:52.595
- What?
- You sure that kid really sold you meth?

52:52.760 --> 52:54.240
Well, no. It wasn't meth. It was molly.

52:54.440 --> 52:55.999
- Molly?
- Yeah. Why? What?

52:56.160 --> 52:57.913
Dogs can't smell molly. What did you do?

52:58.080 --> 52:59.070
What do you mean, what did I do?

52:59.280 --> 53:00.555
I didn't know they can't smell molly.
Why not?

53:00.720 --> 53:04.790
Campbell, you have to train a dog
to smell specific drugs, okay?

53:05.040 --> 53:06.030
How do you think this thing works?

53:06.280 --> 53:08.317
I don't know how it works.
I thought you guys knew how it worked.

53:08.520 --> 53:09.510
We do.

53:09.680 --> 53:11.194
Well, if you do, you should have told me.
What the...

53:11.360 --> 53:13.113
- Oh, snap!
- What?

53:13.280 --> 53:15.112
Cops are leaving the classroom.

53:15.280 --> 53:16.953
- This is over.
- It's over?

53:17.120 --> 53:18.156
Campbell, I'm from the streets.

53:18.320 --> 53:20.437
Trust me when I tell you it's over.

53:20.600 --> 53:22.956
Oh, shit! God damn it. Fucking damn it!

53:23.120 --> 53:24.520
Okay. You know what? You have to relax.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.632
I got something for you.
Take a hit of this.

53:26.920 --> 53:28.115
Yeah. Yeah.

53:29.800 --> 53:32.269
What the fuck is that?
I thought you said you didn't have drugs!

53:32.440 --> 53:34.272
I don't. I have weed.

53:34.840 --> 53:36.069
Jesus! Fuck! Give...

53:47.280 --> 53:49.158
Nice landing, dick wad.

53:53.800 --> 53:56.156
You tried to plant drugs on me,
didn't you?

53:56.360 --> 53:58.317
That's why that dog was here.

53:58.560 --> 54:00.836
But they couldn't smell
those drugs, could they?

54:05.320 --> 54:06.720
You fucked up, Campbell.

54:07.760 --> 54:09.194
I'm in your head.

54:09.760 --> 54:11.911
I know what you gonna do
before you even do it.

54:12.080 --> 54:13.639
Back off. Back off.

54:13.800 --> 54:15.598
All your hard work,

54:15.760 --> 54:18.150
sneaking around lying and shit.

54:19.280 --> 54:21.875
Now it's just you and me.

54:22.680 --> 54:23.716
Don't come closer.

54:23.880 --> 54:25.030
What you think? They're gonna come in here

54:25.240 --> 54:28.039
if you light that little
toothpick pencil joint?

54:28.240 --> 54:29.435
You wanna find out?

54:30.720 --> 54:32.518
Hey! Don't do it.

54:33.120 --> 54:34.156
You be a man.

54:34.440 --> 54:36.033
I refuse!

54:36.200 --> 54:39.034
You know, first I was just
gonna punch you a whole lot, Campbell.

54:40.360 --> 54:43.159
Now, I think I'm gonna break
every bone in your body.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.270
Help!

54:45.440 --> 54:46.760
Help! Police!

54:46.920 --> 54:47.910
What the fuck are you doing, man?

54:48.120 --> 54:49.713
Get away from that God damn door.

54:51.280 --> 54:53.192
You know what? I should kill your ass.

54:53.800 --> 54:54.995
Okay, guys.

54:55.160 --> 54:56.913
What seems to be the trouble here?

54:57.400 --> 54:58.914
Strickland was smoking marijuana.

54:59.200 --> 55:01.396
And he has molly in his bag.

55:01.560 --> 55:02.550
And who are you?

55:02.760 --> 55:04.319
I'll straighten this out for everyone.

55:04.480 --> 55:06.551
Mr. Andy Campbell, English teacher.

55:06.720 --> 55:09.076
Probably a nice guy,
but a bit of a worm and a sneak.

55:09.280 --> 55:11.875
Mr. Strickland, reputation of a hot-head.

55:12.040 --> 55:14.077
Scary, yet effective with the students.

55:14.320 --> 55:16.073
Do I trust either of them?

55:16.240 --> 55:17.674
Absolutely not.

55:18.240 --> 55:19.230
All right, we got this.

55:19.440 --> 55:20.794
Yeah, we got this.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.229
You stay out this shit, Mehar.

55:22.400 --> 55:24.596
Technically, this is occurring
during school hours,

55:24.800 --> 55:26.553
so I cannot stay out this S-word.

55:26.760 --> 55:29.559
There is contraband in here.
Who does this belong to?

55:29.760 --> 55:32.070
Him. The drugs are in his bag.

55:32.240 --> 55:34.357
This man is obviously the drug addict.

55:34.560 --> 55:36.233
Look at his eyes. They burgundy red.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.073
Let the record reflect his eyes are red.

55:38.240 --> 55:40.357
I mean, it's very dry in the room.

55:40.600 --> 55:41.954
It's not that dry.

55:42.120 --> 55:43.873
It is wet with lies.

55:44.080 --> 55:45.719
He's holding an ax!

55:45.880 --> 55:46.916
This is true as well.

55:47.080 --> 55:49.072
Mr. Strickland is brandishing a weapon.

55:51.440 --> 55:52.590
We all saw that.

55:52.760 --> 55:55.355
Am I the only one here
who sees what's going on? Hello!

55:55.520 --> 55:56.510
Hello.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.837
Not hello you.
Hello, we're in his classroom!

55:59.040 --> 56:00.235
Hello, there are drugs in his bag!

56:00.400 --> 56:03.040
Hello, this man
is obviously the culprit here.

56:03.240 --> 56:04.913
I just said "hello" back.
He said "hello," I said "hello."

56:05.080 --> 56:07.072
Let's move past that.
Just arrest... Arrest the guy.

56:07.280 --> 56:09.192
Campbell, you've had your say.

56:09.760 --> 56:11.956
Mr. Strickland, care to respond?

56:15.600 --> 56:16.954
Fuck the police.

56:19.080 --> 56:20.639
Nice plan, asshole.

56:28.160 --> 56:31.756
Ally, hey! Sweetie, listen,

56:31.920 --> 56:32.910
something's come up

56:33.080 --> 56:36.790
at uh, work and...

56:37.880 --> 56:42.238
I'm not gonna be
able to make it to the talent show.

56:42.680 --> 56:45.070
Daddy, you promised you would make it.

56:45.240 --> 56:46.594
You promised me.

56:46.760 --> 56:47.876
I know.

56:48.320 --> 56:51.711
Sometimes, adults' lives are complicated,

56:51.880 --> 56:53.758
you know, funny things you can't predict.

56:53.920 --> 56:55.991
I can't believe you're not gonna come.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.717
I'm gonna look like such an idiot.

56:59.120 --> 57:00.713
Trisha's gonna ruin me.

57:00.880 --> 57:01.996
Forget about that girl.

57:02.160 --> 57:04.720
I mean, she sounds like a big bully to me.

57:04.880 --> 57:07.111
And believe me, I know what that's like.

57:08.160 --> 57:09.150
Hello?

57:20.120 --> 57:21.918
Unbelievable.

57:23.840 --> 57:25.274
Unbelievable.

57:25.760 --> 57:28.195
Yeah, that's what it is, you know.

57:28.880 --> 57:30.030
You know what I told my wife today?

57:30.200 --> 57:32.874
I said, "Hey, honey,
everything's gonna be okay."

57:33.040 --> 57:36.351
Yeah. And that
was a big fat lie, wasn't it?

57:37.160 --> 57:40.035
I mean, I'm definitely not gonna make
the meeting, so I'll lose my job,

57:40.200 --> 57:41.873
and I've let my daughter down,

57:42.040 --> 57:45.829
and now I'm probably gonna be in prison
when my child is born. So...

57:47.040 --> 57:48.520
Yo, who fault is that?

57:50.000 --> 57:51.719
No, that's a good question.
Whose fault is it?

57:51.880 --> 57:54.349
It's your fucking fault.
Are you fucking kidding me?

57:54.520 --> 57:55.715
Yeah, because you know what I don't do?

57:55.880 --> 57:58.031
I don't swing axes at the students.

57:58.240 --> 58:01.153
Yeah, that's a little bit
of a step too far, I think.

58:01.360 --> 58:03.477
But not for you. No. You know why?

58:03.640 --> 58:05.279
Because you're a fucking maniac.

58:05.760 --> 58:07.399
"Whose fault is it?" God damn it!

58:08.280 --> 58:09.555
Fucking crazy.

58:33.480 --> 58:36.439
What's up, man? How are you doing?

58:36.600 --> 58:39.195
Yeah, getting locked up. It's fucking...

58:39.360 --> 58:41.272
This is some BS, right? Shit.

58:42.280 --> 58:45.671
I... I don't mean to,
you know, interrupt your

58:47.160 --> 58:49.516
seething or whatever it is
you're doing over here,

58:49.680 --> 58:54.118
but I just got in a little argument
with my friend

58:54.440 --> 58:58.036
and he starts talking
some serious shit about you.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.000
And he's goin' on and on,

59:00.160 --> 59:03.198
and he's calling you a bitch,
and a big fat pussy,

59:03.360 --> 59:05.955
and a little fucking pussy bitch,

59:06.120 --> 59:07.679
and he says that you're his bitch.

59:07.840 --> 59:09.115
- What?
- Yeah.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.476
I couldn't believe it.
He just keeps going on and on and on

59:11.640 --> 59:12.790
that he wants to fight you.

59:12.960 --> 59:16.431
I'm like, "This guy?
There's no way! No way!"

59:16.640 --> 59:17.630
- Him?
- Well, don't point.

59:17.800 --> 59:18.790
Yeah, don't point.

59:19.400 --> 59:20.754
What, it's your first time
getting locked up, man?

59:20.920 --> 59:24.152
Come on. Yeah. But, yeah, him. Yeah.

59:24.920 --> 59:27.310
If he wants to fight me, I'm right here.

59:29.160 --> 59:30.150
Yeah.

59:31.040 --> 59:33.236
Yeah, you're here. He's there.

59:33.400 --> 59:34.675
You could just go over there.

59:35.440 --> 59:36.840
And I'd stay here

59:37.000 --> 59:38.639
if you're worried about losing your seat.

59:40.800 --> 59:43.031
I can see that that's not it.
Okay. I tell you what.

59:43.200 --> 59:47.274
I'll go over there,
and if he nods like this

59:47.440 --> 59:50.512
that means he wants to fight you now.

59:50.680 --> 59:53.673
But again, man, he's not gonna come here

59:54.160 --> 59:56.675
because he thinks you're a big fat bitch.

59:56.840 --> 59:58.115
Again, these are his words,
they're not mine.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.357
So just look for that nod
and know that he's calling you

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.556
the biggest bitch on the planet.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.995
Okay. I gotta go.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.353
Okay, so you still wanna fight?

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.153
Forget it.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.876
What?

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.830
Maybe I went a little overboard earlier.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.198
But at least I did something.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:30.909
Fight's off.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.074
Wait. What? Why?

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.877
First, I was just pissed off at you.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.039
Wanted to wring your little neck.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.918
- Yeah.
- But then I start thinking.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.240
What if the school saw

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.960
how they pitted two teachers
against each other?

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.556
Maybe the fight'll make a difference
and something would change.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.397
But you won't even man up and fight.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.990
So, forget it.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.111
Fight's off. You can go
take a free period now.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:03.549
That's...

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.072
That's the best news
I've heard all day. That's great.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.833
Yeah! I'll take that free period.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.832
Awesome, man. So, the fight's off?

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:12.749
That's great!

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.915
You nodding at me? Fuck you!

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.117
No, no, no! Sorry, sir.
That nod was not for you.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.640
You can sit back down.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.200
You wanna fight me, bitch?

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.040
What'd you say to me?

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.436
No, no, no! He doesn't
wanna fight you anymore.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.750
- Yeah, no. Go back.
- Anymore?

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.515
At all! Yeah, no.
Guys, there's no fights today.

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.716
Didn't you hear? Great news!

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.633
Man, stand up, bitch. What you got?

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.120
Oh, no!

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.310
Oh.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.430
Oh.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.960
I got a whole lot!

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.110
I got stuff, too.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.873
But I'm not fighting, you know?

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.475
Guys, guys, this has just
been a misunderstanding.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.399
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.353
Go to sleep.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.632
Go to sleep.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.917
Nighty-night. Nighty-night.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.713
You sic this man on me, Campbell?

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:10.680
That was a mistake. Yeah. That...

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.474
I changed my mind.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.554
Okay. Calm down.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.719
The fight is back on.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.957
Come on, man. You might have done
the same thing in my position.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.635
This time I'm gonna kill your ass.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.514
Just take it easy.
Take a deep breath, okay?

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.439
Hey! You two.

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.239
The molly you tried to pin on each other

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.880
is aspirin. Come on.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.596
Aspirin.
That little fucker tried to rip me off!

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.559
Wait a sec. What time is it?
What time is it?

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:37.110
I still got time!

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.994
I still have time to make everything!

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:44.676
Hey, Campbell! I'll see you at 3:00.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.030
Hey!

01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.429
It's a bloodbath in there.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.754
Holly, Ms. Monet... We all got fired.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.360
No! You, too?

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.356
These damn jeans didn't impress anybody.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:09.599
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, Crawford.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.392
Hey, Suzie. I'm here.
Are they ready for me?

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.590
They said they need just a minute.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.796
Okay, you sure it's
just gonna be a minute?

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.633
Because I'm trying to get
to my daughter's talent show.

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.200
Oh, it's just gonna be a minute.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.959
- Suzie, I don't have a minute.
- Sixty seconds.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.391
Shit! Okay.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:29.954
Okay.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.956
What the fuck is going on in there?

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.230
Just one more minute.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.915
Respectfully, Suzie, fuck this, okay?
I'm going in.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.230
- No, Andy.
- I'm going in!

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.119
Why do you think they haven't
called for you? Andy!

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.873
Hey, hi! I'm sorry, what's going on?

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.235
I was supposed to start at 2:15.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.513
Oh! Uh, uh...

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.118
Superintendent Johnson and I were just
talking about his fishing trip to Alaska.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.359
I caught a halibut.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:10.637
You... You caught a halibut.
Well, congratulations, sir.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.473
I... I'm sitting out there
and missing my daughter's...

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.630
You know what?

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:16.360
I don't wanna cause trouble. Could I just
make my teacher's statement now?

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:17.670
Is that all right?

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.275
Well, actually, that won't be necessary.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.673
- Why?
- Turns out we've reached our limit

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.837
on how many experienced
teachers we can let go

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.878
and still be in compliance
with state policy.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.639
We gotta make cuts from somewhere else.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.759
Yeah. We're done here.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.596
Anyway, it's an executive
course right by the airport, right?

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.919
Okay, thanks for the job, I guess.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.478
Step tight. Pop! You know.

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.796
I'm sorry though.
What cuts are you gonna make?

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.389
It's none of your business, Campbell.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.596
Well, no, it is my business, right?

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.796
I... I teach at the school.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.440
So, what are you gonna do?

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.440
I mean, you gonna cut buying new books
or are you gonna shorten the school year?

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.834
You gonna increase the class sizes again?
That one was a real bright idea.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.475
Now would be a real good time
for you to stop talking.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.711
Yeah, now... Now would
be a good time for me to stop talking,

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.036
but I'm not gonna stop talking, okay?

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:09.318
'Cause I... I'm asking a question.
So, I'm sorry, but what cut...

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:10.880
No, I'm not sorry. All right?

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.952
I think, in fact, I'm tired
of always saying I'm sorry.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.316
I asked you guys
a direct fucking question.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.470
What cutbacks are you gonna make?

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.672
Campbell, this doesn't concern you, okay?

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:19.990
You're just a teacher.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.637
Wow! Really? I'm just a teacher?

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.519
Well, all right. You're right.
I may be just a teacher,

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.874
but I'm pretty sure that qualifies me
to ask a goddamn question

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.357
about something that's gonna affect
my ability to fucking teach!

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.080
Campbell, get your
ass out of here while you still got a job!

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:35.350
No, I can't do it, man,

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.193
because I'm done listening to you.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.713
And I know I'm just a teacher,

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.792
but that ought to be worth
something around here.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.151
In fact, that ought to be
worth everything to you guys,

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.789
but instead, you treat us like shit.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.435
And you don't give us the tools
to do our jobs properly.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.869
And I can't believe I'm saying this,
but Strickland's right.

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:54.872
The students are running
all over the fucking school.

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.953
So this may be just a teacher's opinion,

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.237
but you guys fucking suck at your jobs.

01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:03.230
And if you ever leave me
waiting outside again

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.278
so you can talk about
a goddamn fishing trip,

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:06.675
I will walk right in here

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.400
and I'll punch you right in
the fucking teeth, Tyler.

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.198
Stick that halibut up your ass!

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:25.631
Five hundred twenty-five thousand

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.996
Six hundred minutes

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.116
Five hundred twenty-five thousand

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.272
Moments so dear

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.629
She's so lame.

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.514
Five hundred
twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.240
- How do you measure a year in the life?
- Oh, God.

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:47.237
How about love?

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.479
How about love?

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.756
How about...

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.835
Oh, shit!

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.196
- Honey, what...
- Hey.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.350
What the hell happened to you?

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.751
Sweetie. Look, I've had a crazy day, okay?

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:09.996
I... I don't have time to explain.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.277
Look, can you do me a big favor right now?

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.510
Okay.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:16.998
I need you to see if you can get them
to play that... That Big Sean song.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.674
- Can you do it?
- Yeah. Okay.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:19.956
Okay. I'm gonna talk to Ally.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.952
Oh, my God! You're the best!
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.794
Let's give it up again
for Ally Campbell and her...

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.800
And herself.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.756
Hey, buddy. Um, I'm gonna
need a little favor from you.

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.357
Ally! Ally! Hey, sweetie.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.000
Daddy, where were you?

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.833
Okay, okay, I can explain
that later, all right?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.960
But right now, sweetie,
we're going right back out there.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.355
No, Daddy. The rules are
that we have to...

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:45.510
Don't worry about the rules, okay?

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.670
We're not gonna play
by the rules, all right?

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.996
- We're not?
- No! Here's what we're gonna do.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.640
We're gonna do the Big Sean song.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.634
Wait, we are?

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.632
- Yeah! Mom's working on it.
- She is?

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.832
I'll follow your lead
and the moves are the same, right?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.275
Yeah, the moves are the same.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.480
There it goes. Okay, we gotta go.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.239
- Let's get out there. Let's go.
- Okay, let's do this.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.315
Go, go, go.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.155
Trisha, this song is for you.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.118
I don't fuck with you

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.839
You little stupid ass bitch
I ain't fuckin' with you

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.149
What?

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.317
You little
You little dumb ass bitch

01:08:19.479 --> 01:08:21.073
I ain't fuckin' with you

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.200
I got a million trillion things

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:25.510
That I'd rather fuckin' do

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.113
All right, fuck it.
This what we're doing? All right.

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:29.158
Than to be fucking with you

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:30.675
Little stupid ass
I don't give a fuck

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:31.830
I don't give a fuck

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.234
I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck

01:08:33.399 --> 01:08:35.710
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.036
Or anything that you do

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.237
Don't give a fuck about you
or anything that you do

01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:41.868
I heard you got a new man
I see you takin' a pic

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.350
Then you post it up
Thinkin' that it's makin' me sick

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.876
But I see you calling
I be makin' it quick

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:50.317
I'mma answer that shit like
I don't fuck with you

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:55.233
You little stupid ass bitch
I ain't fucking with you

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:59.953
You little dumb ass bitch
I ain't fucking with you

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:03.788
I got a million trillion things
That I'd rather fucking do

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.189
Okay, music stopped.

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:07.317
Than to be fucking with you

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:09.198
Little stupid ass
I don't give a fuck

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:10.350
- I don't give a fuck
- Yeah!

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.000
I don't, I don't
I don't give a fuck bitch.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:13.953
- They just stopped the music.
- I don't give a fuck about you

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.109
Or anything that you do

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:16.600
Don't give a fuck about you
or anything that you do

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.399
Need you to stop. Okay.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.752
Who's the loser now, Trisha?

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.759
Bully this, bitch!

01:09:27.399 --> 01:09:28.993
Oh, my!

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:32.916
I was unaware of the lyrics

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:37.911
and... And the strong language
in that song, so I do apologize.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:42.272
But you know what?
I apologize for nothing else.

01:09:51.399 --> 01:09:53.392
Yeah! Way to go, Ally!

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.835
That's my girl!

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.954
Whoo! Oh. Damn!

01:09:58.760 --> 01:09:59.750
Way to go, kid!

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:02.111
Thanks, Dad. I'm gonna
be a rock star here now.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.794
Yeah, no.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.599
- I... I think you're gonna be expelled.
- Oh...

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.393
Yeah, yeah. But, look, look,
I'm super proud of you

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.074
- for standing up for yourself, okay?
- Yeah.

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.435
All right, I gotta go do the same,
all right?

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.313
- Daddy's gotta run.
- Wait, where are you going?

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.114
Daddy's gotta get in a fist fight.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.270
Shit!

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.272
Hey! That's my scooter!

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.310
No shit.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:41.956
Fuck, man.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.716
Mr. Campbell!

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.599
Let's go! Kill him!

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.153
- Come on, man, Campbell! Come on, baby.
- Yes, get him! Kill him!

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.672
Fucking kill him. Fucking destroy him.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.994
You ready to do this, motherfucker?

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.914
You actually sound
like a real man, Campbell.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.639
Maybe one of your nuts dropped today.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.871
I'll drop your nuts, bitch.
Back the fuck up. Let's go.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:16.190
You wanna see what I'm made out of?

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.190
Oh, fuck!

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:23.314
See? Let that be a lesson to you.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.673
Actions have consequences.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.800
Campbell!

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.472
You want some more of this, huh, boy?

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:36.110
Oh, shit!

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.120
How do you like
this ass-whooping, Campbell?

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.509
I fucking love it, bitch!

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:53.436
Ahh! Shit!

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.114
Oh, shit!

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.716
- Oh!
- That's my stuff, damn it!

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.634
Yeah!

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.115
Oh!

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.994
God damn it!

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.030
Fuck!

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.112
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.439
- Shit! Fuck this shit.
- Campbell, stay down!

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.193
Campbell, stay down!

01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.240
Bruce Lee style!

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.516
God damn it.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.958
Right here. I should just kill you.

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.110
Fuck you, man.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.556
Whoever dies first haunts the school.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.832
You've got this, Campbell!

01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.879
Okay, come here. Come here.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.190
Take it, bitch!

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.430
Fuck you!

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.711
Come on, this way.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.677
- Stop this!
- It is not my job to stop this.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.270
Fake ass John McEnroe!

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:54.990
Yeah!

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.033
Ooh, mother...

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.390
Oh!

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.114
Oh, shit!

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.919
Come on, motherfucker! Get up!

01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.675
- You got this!
- Whoo!

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.550
I don't think he's got this.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.080
Motherfucker!

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.070
Come on!

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.436
Kick his ass!

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.510
What's the matter, Campbell?
You looking tired.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.872
You throwing less and less punches.

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.191
- It's "fewer and fewer."
- Oh!

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:32.473
The proper sentence structure
is "fewer and fewer".

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.632
Never trash talk an English teacher, okay?

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.434
Oh!

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.149
Get up, Campbell! Get up!

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.356
He's getting up!

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.670
Get up!

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.800
He's getting up!

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:10.238
You can run, but you can't hide.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.395
Campbell!

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.353
Where you at, light roast?

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.440
Campbell?

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.559
Campbell?

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:30.952
Where the fuck are you at?

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.432
Surprise, bitch!

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.036
Get the fuck off me!

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.110
Shit!

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:43.593
You dirty mother...
What the fuck is this shit?

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.434
Campbell! Come here.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.359
So I can fuck you up. Come here.

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.631
You know, I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.995
You want some of this?

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.674
You little son of a bitch.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.470
What you got?

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.756
Come on, motherfucker.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.593
What do I got?

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.834
I got nothing to lose!

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.433
Oh, I'm learning so much!

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.078
Almost there.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.550
Oh!

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.832
I came anyway, motherfuckers!

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:17.073
Fuck over here. Shit!

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.031
Excuse me,
I'm the superintendent. Get out of my way.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.637
I'mma kill you. Kill you.
Tap your fucking ass.

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:26.360
You like baseball, Strickland?
Batter up, bitch!

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.158
- The, uh, kids superglued that down.
- Huh?

01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.272
I know. They're freaking clever.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.834
Jesus, watch out!

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.840
Stay down, light roast.

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.511
What are you doing, Campbell? What the...

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:50.876
Fuck!

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.230
Fuck me!

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.276
Oh, shit!

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.880
Oh!

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.039
My fucking windshield!

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.350
Shit!

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.031
I'm about sick of this shit, Campbell.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.839
You want some more of this, boy?

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.230
Oh!

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.158
School's out for the summer, everybody.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.400
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.676
Campbell! Campbell!

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:57.116
I'm never gonna stop fighting! Uh-uh!

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.954
I'm never gonna stop fighting for myself.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.998
For my family, for this school!

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:04.914
The fight never ends!
The fight never ends!

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.440
Whoo!

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.914
Like he said,

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:11.554
the fight never ends.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.595
Unless you're him.

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:22.756
Hello?

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.797
Uh, no, well, he's...
He's actually out right now.

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:28.630
Uh-huh.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.879
Oh, shit, okay.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.759
I'll make him aware.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.270
Water! Anybody got water?

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.470
What happened?

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.800
You got knocked the fuck out.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.150
Yeah, I feel that now.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.915
But look, man. Your wife just called.
She said you're having a baby.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.556
Oh, shit, for real? I gotta go then.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.959
Hey, look.
Can you give me a lift to the hospital?

01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.634
I kind of totaled my car.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.630
- All right. Let's roll. I got you.
- All right.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.150
You got gas money?

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.312
Hey! Hey, you!

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.156
What the hell, man?
You're just gonna walk away?

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.789
Just gonna leave like this?
On these terms?

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.592
What the hell are you talking about?

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:17.796
Who are you? I...

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:19.917
Holly. We've been flirting,
like, all fucking year.

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.595
I've been, like, ignoring you all year.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.750
Oh.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.272
Because I've been playing
games with you all year.

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.230
I knew it!

01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.000
It's 3:15 and I'm not a student anymore.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.316
Let's do this.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.190
Ah, shit.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.919
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:48.590
Emergency! Hey, get off your ass, lady.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.356
Sir, emergency's on the other
side of the building.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.830
What? No, no. Not me. We need maternity.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:55.554
Maternity's third floor.

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:57.200
Let's go deliver this baby.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.079
- I got it from here. Yeah.
- You sure?

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:01.038
Yeah, it's a hospital.
So they got doctors and stuff.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.793
But, listen. Uh...

01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.950
Thank you, man.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.600
Like, thank you for the fight. Really.

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:09.636
You did good.

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:14.869
Get the fuck off me. What you doing?

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.833
Yeah. That was a dumb idea.
All right, yeah. See ya.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.030
Go hug your wife.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.714
Two teachers pitted against each other

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.031
in a school fight
to end all school fights.

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.157
A lot of people are saying
this has proven the depths

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.118
to which the public school
system has fallen.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.272
The school board is
launching an investigation

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:30.272
saying something needs to change.

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.432
- Yeah.
- Live from Roosevelt High School,

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.915
Channel 68 News.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.196
That's us.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.596
Hashtag teacher fight!

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:43.430
- Maggie! Hi!
- Andy!

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:45.552
I was so afraid that you wouldn't make it.

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:47.515
- Are you okay?
- What happened to you?

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:48.830
I... I got into a little bit of a fight.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.320
With who? You look like hell!

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.039
- With another teacher. Yeah.
- What?

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.630
But it's okay.
So, honey, listen to me. Listen to me.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.673
- I lost my job.
- What?

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.069
But not 'cause I didn't
stand up to those guys.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.674
You should have seen me
stand up to those guys.

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:02.480
- No, no, no, it's because you were right!
- Yeah? Okay.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.711
And... And I want you to
believe me right now.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.070
I want you to believe me

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.197
when I tell you
everything's gonna be okay.

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.312
- Yeah?
- I believe you.

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:14.470
- You do?
- I believe you.

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:15.670
Yeah?

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:17.638
- Everything's gonna be okay, sweetie.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.790
Oh, God!

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.076
Is it time to push? Or where are we?

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:21.754
Oh, no. We've been pushing
for a while, baby.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.240
- Okay. Go! Push!
- Here we go.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.874
Here we go.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.190
She's squirming around.

01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.589
I think we got
a little fighter on our hands.

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.035
- I think so, too.
- You wanna take her for a minute?

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.470
- I would love to.
- Okay.

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:39.676
- Are you a little hungry?
- Yeah!

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:40.910
Are you a little hungry, baby?

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.554
- Time to eat!
- Yeah!

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.040
Hey, Ally looks happy, huh?

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.351
Oh, yeah! She's very popular now.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.478
I think some of the kids are
actually kind of afraid of her.

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:49.960
That's a good thing, I think.

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.474
How we doing here? What you going for?

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.835
Hot dog? Hamburger?

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.151
Both! Hey, Crawford, you want a dog?

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.837
I want a dog but no bun.
I'm trying to fit into my skinny jeans.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:02.072
I think I look good in them.

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.469
Trying to fit into his skinny jeans.

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.835
Yeah, yeah. It's not his look.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.229
- Campbell.
- They look terrible.

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.555
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.359
You here to fire everybody again?

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.670
Yeah, yeah. Cut the shit, Campbell.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.832
I don't wanna be here
any more than you want me to, okay?

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.878
Well, I wouldn't say that
I don't want you here.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.952
But why are you here?

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:23.356
Well, because of the media attention,

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.996
you and Strickland became
like education folk heroes.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.230
Yeah, how about that, huh?

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:33.235
So, the board wants both of you back
at Roosevelt because of this PR mess.

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:37.391
So, this is fun. So, he sent you here

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.919
to beg me to come back?

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.392
He said my job depends on it.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.670
Did he really?

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.150
Ouch. Shoot.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.437
So, this is a tough one for me, you know?

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.956
'Cause I didn't leave
on great terms and...

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.514
Boy, it sucks when your
job's in someone else's hands like this.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:57.034
Enough of your shit, okay?

01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:58.390
Are you gonna come back or not?

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.109
Tell you what.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.078
I'll come back on one condition.

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:04.995
You the man, Campbell!

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.190
Thank you.

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:07.919
Thanks for getting our jobs back.

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.275
I'm glad I didn't cut you.

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.079
Yeah. Huh?

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.074
Yeah, you really saved our asses.

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:18.390
Yo!

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.559
Hey!

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.353
Look, man, I'm, uh...

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.637
I'm really happy you decided
to take your job back.

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:26.400
Yeah. To be honest,

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.239
I kinda missed these little fuckers.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.234
They keep me young, you know what I mean?

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:34.760
All right, well, what do you say we get
back to work and no free periods, right?

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.833
- Goddamn right.
- Okay.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.639
Hey! Hey!

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.235
You cut out all that grab-assing.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.993
You get your ass to detention, Freddie.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.920
All right, I'm not joking around.
You get there before I kick it there!

01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:47.349
I will kick you into oblivion, Freddie.

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.557
I will kick you into dust!

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.714
Whoa, Campbell. Take it down a notch.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.598
I'm supposed to be the scariest
motherfucker in this school, not you.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.315
That's true. All right, man,
you ready to do this thing?

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.073
- Do it.
- Boom.

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:05.036
Up top! Down low.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.953
- Enough of that shit.
- I'll fight you again.

01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.236
I've been waiting to
fuck you up for a long time.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.960
Why?

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.390
But I'll tell you for an iPhone.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.550
Listen to me, you fuck shit.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:27.915
I will fucking rip your
head off of your head.

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.150
I will shit down your neck.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:32.074
I will fucking smash
my shit into your butthole.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.160
Is there...

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.310
A horse?

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.834
- Yeah, there's some shit.
- Sorry about that, guys.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.229
- Right. I'm out.
- Cut.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.393
See you in a bit.

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.392
I never said nothing about no running.

01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.954
Who's you? Seabiscuit?

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:48.560
You don't run nowhere.

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:51.280
That's the old Andy
because the new Andy...

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:52.550
I'm not gonna...

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.110
I'm gonna just ramble. Forever.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:57.511
I think maybe one of
your nuts dropped today.

01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.676
I'mma drop your nuts down somewhere.

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.515
Finish it!

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.956
- Fuck this shit!
- Come on. This way.

01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:12.076
Make it whole wheat.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:13.833
And can I have some
pork and beans with that?

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.520
No dog. Just tuna fish.

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.512
Just a little bit of
sauerkraut and some relish.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.830
Just Cheezdoodles.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.992
Light on the cheese
and heavy on the doodle.

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:22.560
I'm trying to be like Steve McQueen.

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:23.750
They call me True Grit.

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:26.719
I'm a weirdo. You know my style.

01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:31.196
Yeah. I'm stressed out, too.
My neighbor got a cat.

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.557
- Oh, you don't like a cat looking at you?
- Creeps me out.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:36.360
It's always when I'm masturbating, too.

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.197
I will be done with my classes by then.

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.551
It's not a fucking question!

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:47.916
I still have the knife.

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.713
Say the word and I will end him.

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:51.280
Damn, girl. No!

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:55.074
Am I the only one here

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.560
who sees what's going on? Hello?

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:57.949
Hello.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.236
Hello! Hello!

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:01.550
Hello.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.917
He said "hello." And I said "hello" back.

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.080
I caught a halibut, man.

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.431
Way to go, Ally! That's my girl!

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.160
Bully this, bitch!

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.955
You have a wife? You got a wife?

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:26.715
Yes, you know I have a wife.
We talked about it two scenes ago.

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:29.634
Is that the wrong thing to do?

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.314
Is that an unlikeable thing to do?

01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.756
Yeah! But boo-fucking-hoo!

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.355
I can be a dick, too.
You wanna see me be a dick?

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.273
Hmm. So what do you teach here?

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.235
I teach gym, but I'm a singer.
Can I sing a song to you?

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.516
Uh, uh...

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.030
Go ahead.

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.317
Shorty, I'm there for you
Anytime you need me

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.159
For real, girl
It's me in your world

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:30.154
Believe me, nothing make a
man feel better than a woman

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.670
Queen with a crown
that be down for whatever

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:35.036
There are few things
that's forever, my lady

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:37.277
We can make war or make babies

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:41.277
That's not technically a song.
That's kinda like a rap.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.510
It still sound good, don't it?

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.710
It did! It did.

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.640
Why you keep shaking your legs
like you got something down there

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:48.393
- moving.
- Because you make me nervous.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:50.438
Because I feel love when I see you.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.273
And I mean love.

01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.000
What'd you said your name was again?
