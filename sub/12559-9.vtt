4.3 LIGHT YEARS FROM OUR SUN.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.780
MOST OF MY EQUIPMENT'S GONE.

AS OF THE MOMENT, I DON'T KNOW
THIS PLANET'S DENSITY

01:17.578 --> 01:21.492

THIS CRAFT IS NOT GOING

02:56.093 --> 02:57.675
I WONDER...

02:57.761 --> 02:59.923
I WONDER IF THAT'S
A POSSIBILITY.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.846
<i>(narrator) ONE COLONEL

COLONEL COOK HAS BEEN SET
ADRIFT IN AN OOEAN OF SPACE

03:17.114 --> 03:19.526
IN A METAL LIFEBOAT THAT HAS
BEEN SCORCHED AND DESTROYED

03:19.616 --> 03:21.448
AND WILL NEVER FLY AGAIN.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.742
HE SURVIVED THE CRASH,
BUT HIS ORDEAL IS YET TO BEGIN.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.740
NOW HE MUST GIVE BATTLE
TO LONELINESS.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.448
NOW COLONEL COOK
MUST MEET THE UNKNOWN.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.704
IT'S A SMALL PLANET
SET DEEP IN SPACE,

03:30.794 --> 03:33.377
BUT FOR COLONEL COOK,
IT'S THE TWILIGHT ZONE.

04:41.948 --> 04:46.863

05:26.034 --> 05:28.822
I VVORKED ON THE SOLAR CELLS SO
I'LL BE SENDING OUT MORE POVVER.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.486
IT'LL BE TEMPORARY,

05:30.580 --> 05:31.991
BUT YOU'RE COMING IN
STRONGER NOW, TOO.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.572
<i>WHAT ABOUT

05:33.667 --> 05:35.908

05:39.756 --> 05:41.542
I'VE BEEN OUTSIDE.
THERE'S PLANT LIFE,

05:41.633 --> 05:42.839
BUT I WAS PRETTY
SURE OF THAT

05:42.926 --> 05:44.508
WHEN I SPIRALED IN.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.096
THE GRAVITY PULL'S
ABOUT THE SAME AS OURS,

05:46.179 --> 05:47.556
AND WHAT I CAN TELL
OF THE ATMOSPHERE,

05:47.639 --> 05:49.255

THERE'S ALWAYS
A MAJOR CRISIS

05:58.733 --> 06:00.269

TALK OF WAR.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.226
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME,

06:02.320 --> 06:04.436
BUT MY OVVN PROBLEM HAS A
LITTLE MORE IMMEDIACY FOR ME.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.863
IT'S A LITTLE
MORE PERSONALIZED.

06:06.950 --> 06:10.784
L'\/E GOT A WEEK'S FOOD LEFT AND
TVVO BROKEN BONES IN ONE ARM.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.953
CAN'T ANOTHER SHIP

06:13.039 --> 06:15.872
<i>THERE ISN'T ANOTHER SHIP,

06:15.959 --> 06:18.451
<i>IF WE HAVE WAR

06:18.545 --> 06:21.207
<i>THERE ISN'T GONNA BE ANYBODY

06:21.256 --> 06:23.623
<i>THAT'S THE
REALISTIC VIEW.</i>

06:23.717 --> 06:27.551
<i>THAT MAY GO DOWN HARD BUT
THOSE ARE THE FACTS OF LIFE.</i>

06:27.637 --> 06:31.130

07:29.157 --> 07:30.693
<i>ANYTHING NEW

L'\/E GOT A VVIND THAT
SINGS SAD SONGS TO ME.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.870
THERE'S SOME FRUIT TREES
THAT MIGHT PROVIDE FOOD

07:40.961 --> 07:43.293
IF IT'S NOT POISONOUS, AND
THAT'S IT, THAT'S ALL OF IT.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.213
<i>NOT THAT IT WILL PROVIDE
VAST SOLACE TO YOU,</i>

07:46.299 --> 07:49.041
<i>BUT AT 9500

08:38.018 --> 08:39.929
WHAT YOU THINK OF

08:44.566 --> 08:47.024

13:25.388 --> 13:27.299
I'M GOING TO WALK
OUT OF HERE

13:27.390 --> 13:30.223
SO YOU CAN HAVE A CHANCE
TO GET OUT WHEN I'M NOT HERE.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.221
I'LL BE OUTSIDE.

13:32.312 --> 13:36.055
YOU'LL HEAR MY FOOTSTEPS
SO YOU'LL KNOW THAT I'M LEAVING.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.140
YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND
THIS LANGUAGE,

13:38.234 --> 13:40.566
BUT THE TONE MAY BE
GETTING THROUGH TO YOU.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.896
YOU CAN COME OUT NOW
WHEN-WHENEVER YOU WANT

13:43.990 --> 13:45.071
AND WE CAN TALK.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.182
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN

15:43.276 --> 15:44.766
IN A FEW MINUTES?

15:44.861 --> 15:46.443
I'M GONNA WAKE UP
FROM THIS NIGHTMARE,

15:46.529 --> 15:48.941
<i>AND I'M GOING TO
CHARGE OUT OF BED</i>

15:49.031 --> 15:51.113
LIKE A ROCKET,

15:51.200 --> 15:53.942
AND I'M GOING
TO TELL THEM BACK HOME,

15:54.036 --> 15:56.698
"YOU CAN TALK ABOUT DREAMS
FROM NOW ON,

15:56.789 --> 15:58.530
"BUT I GET THE PRIZE

<i>YOU UNDERSTAND?</i>

16:04.380 --> 16:08.465
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:08.551 --> 16:12.465
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
I'M SAYING?

16:12.513 --> 16:15.380
MY NAME IS COOK.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.512
<i>I COME FROM
ANOTHER PLANET.</i>

16:17.602 --> 16:20.970
<i>I CRASH-LANDED HERE.</i>

16:21.063 --> 16:23.020
<i>I CRACKED
UP MY SHIP.</i>

16:23.107 --> 16:24.814
I'M THE WINGLESS SPACEMAN,
NO PLACE TO GO

16:24.901 --> 16:27.142
AND ALL THE TIME IN THE
UNIVERSE TO GET THERE.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.613
LOOK...

16:35.578 --> 16:37.489
THIS IS MY GALAXY.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.491
SEE, I WENT OFF-COURSE.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.328
I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH
POWER TO GET BACK.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.579
THIS WAS THE ONLY
PLACE I COULD FIND

16:43.669 --> 16:45.580
THAT LOOKED INHABITABLE.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.663
HERE, RIGHT HERE,
WHERE WE ARE.

16:48.758 --> 16:52.342
OH, WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

16:52.428 --> 16:55.011
YOU'RE PROBABLY AN
ILLUSION ANYWAY,

16:55.097 --> 16:56.599
JUST AS THOSE
MARKINGS YOU LEFT

16:56.682 --> 16:58.138
ARE AN ILLUSION
AS WELL.

16:58.226 --> 17:02.561
SO... YOU CAN
DISAPPEAR ANYTIME NOW.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.354
UNDERSTAND?

17:12.573 --> 17:15.941
THAT'S YOU R GALAXY.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.117
THAT'S YOUR PLANET.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.570
THAT'S WHERE
YOU CAME FROM.

17:20.665 --> 17:23.123
YOUR PLANET GOT
OUT OF ITS ORBIT

17:23.209 --> 17:25.040
AND MOVED AWAY
FROM YOUR SUN

17:25.127 --> 17:27.710
THAT'S WHERE YOU WENT,
WHERE YOUR WORLD WENT.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.708
BUT YOU GOT OUT.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.585
HOW MANY OTHERS?

17:31.676 --> 17:33.963
[sighing]

17:34.053 --> 17:36.545
YOU...

17:36.639 --> 17:39.051

FOUR, FIVE...

17:40.977 --> 17:42.559
AND... ANY OTHERS?

17:42.645 --> 17:45.808
EM.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.310
NO, EM.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.812

17:49.902 --> 17:51.734
WHAT ABOUT YOUR SHIP?

17:51.821 --> 17:53.562
<i>WHERE'S YOUR SHIP?</i>

17:53.614 --> 17:55.321

NORDA?

18:12.258 --> 18:16.001
NORDA.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.086
SO, HOW DOES IT FIGURE?

18:18.180 --> 18:19.557
ANYWAY, WE'RE
STUCK HERE.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.972
A ONE-ARMED MAN
WITH A BROKEN RIB

18:22.059 --> 18:23.345
AND A TIRED WOMAN.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.517
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN LIVING ON?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.265
UH, WHAT FOOD?

18:26.355 --> 18:31.270
WHAT TO EAT?

18:31.360 --> 18:33.442
WELL, I CAN
OFFER YOU FOOD

18:33.529 --> 18:35.440
AND I CAN OFFER
YOU COMPANIONSHIP.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.649
WE COULD SPEND THE REST
OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER

18:38.743 --> 18:40.199
DRAWING DIAGRAMS...

18:40.286 --> 18:42.527
WHICH WOULD BECOME
RATHER TEDIOUS.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.954
BUT THE BRIGHTER OF
US WILL HAVE TO LEARN

18:45.041 --> 18:47.999
THE OTHER'S
LANGUAGE EVENTUALLY.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.292
COME, NORDA.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.631
EAT.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.705

19:21.202 --> 19:23.239
NORDA, PLEASE, PLEASE...

19:23.329 --> 19:24.740
I'M NOT GOING
TO HURT YOU.

19:24.830 --> 19:25.661
PLEASE.

19:25.706 --> 19:26.411
[grunt]

19:33.172 --> 19:36.836
IT'S NOT JUST THE LANGUAGE.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.008
IT'S OUR BREED.

19:39.095 --> 19:46.934
IT'S THE VVAY VVE ULTIMATELY
ALVVAYS RESPOND TO ONE ANOTHER.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.182
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.433
GOOD LUCK.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.686
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
ANY SOIL TEST.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.446
I CAN'T SEND YOU
ANY PLANT SPECIES

20:00.533 --> 20:02.615
OR ANIMALS
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

20:02.702 --> 20:05.444
BUT I CAN GIVE YOU
AN OBSERVATION

20:05.538 --> 20:08.451
AS TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL
MAKEUP OF MAN.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.782
HE'S A FRIGHTENED BREED.

20:10.876 --> 20:14.619
HE'S A VERY FRIGHTENED BREED.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.625
MUST BE A UNIVERSAL TRAIT.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.708
MUST BE THE CASE
WHEREVER THERE'S LIFE.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.719
SO WE'RE NOT ALONE ON THAT.

20:23.764 --> 20:27.302
IT IS REALLY QUITE A PITY...

20:27.393 --> 20:29.225
AS YOU MAY
HAVE PERCEIVED

20:29.311 --> 20:35.478
IF ANY OF YOU HAVE SURVIVED...

20:35.568 --> 20:37.650
DO YOU HEAR ME, BASE?

20:37.737 --> 20:41.321
DO YOU HEAR ME?

20:41.407 --> 20:44.820
<i>(Larrabee) I HOPE IT
CAN COME WITHOUT FEAR.</i>

20:44.910 --> 20:47.823

20:50.875 --> 20:53.913
<i>I HOPE YOU'LL FIND
NO WORD SUCH AS HATE.</i>

20:54.003 --> 20:55.414
<i>I HOPE THERE'LL BE...</i>

21:14.565 --> 21:16.522
AH, JUST IN TIME
TO SAY GOODBYE.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.192
GOING TO TRY ANOTHER PLACE
OVER IN THAT DIRECTION.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.939
MORE VEGETATION,

21:21.030 --> 21:23.692

EVEN FLOWERS, IT APPEARS.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.195
SORT OF, UH...
SORT OF LIKE A GARDEN.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.447

HOVV LONG, BUT VVE CAN TRY.

21:53.979 --> 21:56.232
