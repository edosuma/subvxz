WEBVTT

02:04.667 --> 02:07.000
Detective Rush, Cold Jobs.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.917
Uh, Roy Minard.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.375
Uh, fallen from grace.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.959
- Is that right?
- Yes.

02:15.041 --> 02:19.041
You're looking at
a ruined man, I'm afraid.

02:19.125 --> 02:22.166
- Want to sit down?
- Thank you.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.041
I was a, uh..

02:25.125 --> 02:27.667
I was a professor
at the University

02:27.750 --> 02:29.709
enjoying a quiet life
of arts and sciences

02:29.792 --> 02:34.417
when I became embroiled...
in a murder case.

02:34.500 --> 02:37.834
My unfortunate role was
as the number one suspect.

02:37.917 --> 02:40.375
Who had the
unfortunate
role of victim?

02:40.458 --> 02:42.041
Uh..

02:42.125 --> 02:43.583
Holly Richardson.

02:45.458 --> 02:47.291
Here.
She was one of my students.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.500
Very promising young mind.

02:49.583 --> 02:51.667
- Killed on campus?
- Nine years ago.

02:51.750 --> 02:55.542
Whipped and strangled
with a car antenna.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.208
Awful.

02:57.291 --> 02:59.542
Well, there must have been
a reason you were
investigated.

02:59.625 --> 03:00.709
And one reason only.

03:00.792 --> 03:02.375
Holly and I were
having an affair.

03:02.458 --> 03:03.917
Ah.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.458
Which I lied about
at the time.

03:07.542 --> 03:08.750
Why?

03:09.667 --> 03:11.834
Why does a philanderer lie?

03:11.917 --> 03:13.250
I was married.

03:13.333 --> 03:16.250
- Ashamed of my behavior.
- Covering your tracks.

03:16.333 --> 03:19.125
And my dishonesty on
that matter was seen as guilt

03:19.208 --> 03:21.750
in this far
more serious charge.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.625
The, uh, press went to town.

03:24.709 --> 03:27.750
My wife and child
left town.

03:27.834 --> 03:29.583
And I was soon relieved
of my professorship

03:29.667 --> 03:31.792
and banned from the campus.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.291
Well, you're
here
talking to me

03:33.375 --> 03:35.583
so clearly you weren't
convicted of anything.

03:35.667 --> 03:36.959
Not in a court of law.

03:37.041 --> 03:39.458
And you're
innocent,
of course.

03:39.542 --> 03:41.333
You've heard
of Richard Jewell?

03:41.417 --> 03:42.458
Yeah.

03:42.542 --> 03:44.291
He and I would have
a lot to talk about.

03:44.375 --> 03:46.500
So, why come in
today, Roy?

03:46.583 --> 03:49.250
Uh, I found this..

03:49.333 --> 03:50.917
...in the newspaper.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.959
A prostitute in Norristown
was killed and dumped

03:54.041 --> 03:56.208
in the Schuylkill two weeks
ago.
Same as Holly.

03:56.291 --> 03:58.208
A lot of bodies
are dumped in the
river.

03:58.291 --> 04:01.041
Yes, but this one
was also killed

04:01.125 --> 04:02.500
with a car antenna.

04:05.875 --> 04:07.583
I saw that and
I, uh, I thought

04:07.667 --> 04:09.542
maybe I've found
my one-armed man.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.208
Now, you're
Richard
Kimble.

04:12.291 --> 04:13.542
If there is a connection

04:13.625 --> 04:16.250
maybe you can solve
two murders.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.375
And save my life
in the process.

04:54.542 --> 04:55.834
"Holly Richardson, 21.

04:55.917 --> 04:57.792
"Killed in West Philly,
May '95.

04:57.875 --> 04:59.291
"14 lashes with an antenna

04:59.375 --> 05:00.750
before he strangled
her with it."

05:00.834 --> 05:03.208
Little humiliation
before the grand finale.

05:03.291 --> 05:04.542
Yeah, dumped
in the
Schuylkill.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.000
Doer was probably trying
to wash away evidence.

05:07.083 --> 05:08.542
Uh, they found semen.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.375
- Oh, Professor Minard's?
- 'Yep.'

05:10.458 --> 05:11.709
So, they did it
the night of the
murder.

05:11.792 --> 05:13.458
Outside of that,
what do we got?

05:13.542 --> 05:15.083
He and Holly were
at the same party

05:15.166 --> 05:16.667
at the Elizabethan Club.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.875
Some people saw them
having words.

05:18.959 --> 05:20.291
Words?

05:20.375 --> 05:22.375
I love how them
Ivy Leaguers talk.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.875
They had a
fight,
okay, dummy?

05:24.959 --> 05:26.208
Okay, so that's
the whole case?

05:26.291 --> 05:28.041
- That's about it.
- 'That's nothing.'

05:28.125 --> 05:29.709
Why'd this guy get
the pinch?

05:29.792 --> 05:31.750
He lied about the affair
till the DNA came back.

05:31.834 --> 05:33.375
Then, he changed his story.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.417
How's the Norristown
murder come into play?

05:35.500 --> 05:37.709
This hooker job had
a pretty similar MO.

05:37.792 --> 05:39.417
The antenna,
the river dump.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.750
Worth getting a look
at that Norristown file.

05:41.834 --> 05:43.166
Vera won't mind
taking a ride.

05:43.250 --> 05:45.417
This professor still
teaching Art History?

05:45.500 --> 05:49.125
- English as a second
language.
- Step or two down.

05:49.208 --> 05:50.583
Paid a high price
if he's innocent.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.625
Or if he's guilty he's got
a lot of free years.

05:53.709 --> 05:56.083
So, we reinvestigate him, too.

05:59.667 --> 06:01.625
Hi, we meet
again.
Excuse me.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.709
Professor Minard,
my partner Scotty Valens.

06:03.792 --> 06:05.083
- Hi.
- Thank you.

06:05.166 --> 06:06.917
Well, you're very kind
to call me "Professor"

06:07.000 --> 06:09.583
but around here
I'm,
I'm just Mr. Roy.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.959
Yeah, okay.

06:12.041 --> 06:14.375
So, does this visit
mean
there was something

06:14.458 --> 06:16.458
to my amateur
detective's
theory?

06:16.542 --> 06:19.250
We don't know yet.

06:19.333 --> 06:20.834
I've spent a lot of time
of the last nine years

06:20.917 --> 06:22.291
reading mystery novels.
I thought, maybe

06:22.375 --> 06:24.083
I was getting carried away.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.917
(Valens)
'Uh, we haven't seen
the file from Norristown
yet.'

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
But, uh, we were
wondering
where you were..

06:32.875 --> 06:35.667
...the, uh, night that
hooker got killed.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.542
Right, um..

06:44.917 --> 06:47.542
I teach here nights,
Monday through Thursday.

06:47.625 --> 06:50.500
- What night was she killed?
- It was a Tuesday.

06:50.583 --> 06:52.959
Then, I was here.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.750
22 other witnesses
will tell you the same

06:55.834 --> 06:59.625
in, in broken
but improving English.

06:59.709 --> 07:01.125
Lying about your affair
with Holly

07:01.208 --> 07:02.709
got you in a lot
of hot water.

07:02.792 --> 07:05.375
I was arrogant.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.875
Bill Clinton lied to
America about the
intern.

07:10.417 --> 07:11.792
I lied to Philadelphia.

07:11.875 --> 07:13.458
And you both got
caught in the end.

07:13.542 --> 07:16.166
I wouldn't do it again.

07:16.250 --> 07:20.000
DNA...will get
you
every time.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.083
So, when Holly was killed

07:21.166 --> 07:23.792
how were you two
getting along?

07:23.875 --> 07:26.417
Well, in my first statement
I said things were great.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.125
Hmm, I know.

07:29.208 --> 07:31.625
But to be honest,
there was some tension.

07:33.959 --> 07:38.000
If I had a small
dinner party, would you come?

07:38.083 --> 07:41.500
Small, as in you and me?

07:41.583 --> 07:43.709
Maybe, six people
or eight.

07:43.792 --> 07:46.375
- No, I wouldn't.
- Why not?

07:46.458 --> 07:48.750
Holly.

07:48.834 --> 07:50.417
There are rules.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.667
Well, I want
to see you in public.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.166
You can't.

07:55.250 --> 07:56.375
God, don't you
ever even

07:56.458 --> 07:57.917
think about me
outside this office?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.375
Sure, thinking
is perfectly
fair.

08:00.458 --> 08:03.583
Seeing each other
outside
of these four walls..

08:03.667 --> 08:04.917
...is not possible.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.375
What if I don't like
those rules anymore?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.542
Sounds like you laid
it out pretty clear.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.625
My campus and my home life
stayed separate.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.750
No contact outside
of office hours.

08:18.834 --> 08:19.959
Is that what you called it?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.750
Not even phone calls.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.208
Here's the deal, Roy.

08:23.291 --> 08:24.375
If we're gonna look
at this case again

08:24.458 --> 08:25.625
you gotta be an
open book this time.

08:25.709 --> 08:28.125
Done.
In
fact..

08:29.750 --> 08:31.375
- Here it is.
- 'What is this?'

08:31.458 --> 08:34.500
It's a list of women
who were also--

08:34.583 --> 08:35.750
Conquests?

08:37.333 --> 08:39.458
Did you offer these names
in the first investigation?

08:39.542 --> 08:42.250
No, I was pretending
Holly was the only
one.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.208
They'll probably badmouth me.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.250
You'll hear a lot
about bad behavior

08:46.333 --> 08:49.041
but nothing
that says
murder.

08:49.125 --> 08:51.250
I was sick in love
with that jerk.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.750
I see you took
two
different art
history

08:53.834 --> 08:55.792
courses with
him,
spring of '92.

08:55.875 --> 08:58.917
Hmm, 'cause I couldn't
get enough of him.

08:59.000 --> 08:59.959
You know how vile it is

09:00.041 --> 09:02.041
to know you were
with a murderer?

09:02.125 --> 09:03.792
Now why do you think
he's a murderer?

09:03.875 --> 09:06.083
I read the papers.
He told City Magazine

09:06.166 --> 09:08.625
he didn't do anything
to "Hurt that girl."

09:08.709 --> 09:12.458
Pretty strange word
choice,
don't you think?

09:12.542 --> 09:15.959
Well, was he ever
violent with you?

09:16.041 --> 09:17.083
No.

09:17.166 --> 09:20.917
- Possessive? Scary, at all?
- No.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.333
But you still think
maybe he could have whipped

09:22.417 --> 09:24.792
and strangled
this Holly to death.

09:24.875 --> 09:26.041
I read the papers.

09:27.375 --> 09:30.542
He toyed with me
my whole sophomore year.

09:30.625 --> 09:32.208
Treated you bad?

09:32.291 --> 09:33.792
Like a piece of ass.

09:33.875 --> 09:37.625
Seduced me with poetry
and wine during office hours.

09:37.709 --> 09:40.083
Pretended not to know me
if I saw him on campus.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.417
You think he murdered Holly?

09:42.500 --> 09:44.834
He got a lawyer
pretty fast.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.834
I'll tell you a secret, Monique.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.750
That's actually
the smart thing to
do.

09:48.834 --> 09:52.083
Seems like the guilty
thing to do, to me.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.834
Roy Minard?

09:54.917 --> 09:57.834
I wouldn't say that name
too loudly around here.

09:57.917 --> 10:00.000
We need to know about
your relationship with him.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.000
In '94?

10:03.917 --> 10:05.041
I'm on the faculty now.

10:05.125 --> 10:06.792
It'd be bad for
me
if that got out.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.208
Is that why you kept it
from the police nine years
ago?

10:09.291 --> 10:11.125
I was never asked.

10:11.208 --> 10:14.709
Look, this isn't popular
opinion around campus

10:14.792 --> 10:17.166
but Roy didn't kill Holly.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.333
You don't think so?

10:18.417 --> 10:20.083
He was unethical
but he's not a murderer.

10:20.166 --> 10:22.333
You didn't think
he
was unethical in
'94.

10:22.417 --> 10:23.583
I didn't really get
what an abuse

10:23.667 --> 10:25.834
it was until
I started
teaching.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.834
It's just so easy
to impress students.

10:28.917 --> 10:31.083
And Roy's very charismatic.

10:31.166 --> 10:33.542
We've met him.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.542
Did you know
Holly
Richardson?

10:36.959 --> 10:39.834
I tried to warn her not to
get in too deep with Roy.

10:39.917 --> 10:42.709
I talked to her that night
at the Elizabethan Club.

10:45.667 --> 10:48.250
Haven't seen you all
day.
How're you doin'?

10:57.458 --> 11:00.166
It's not so easy
seeing
them in the flesh, is
it?

11:00.250 --> 11:02.500
- What?
- 'The wife, the kid.'

11:02.583 --> 11:03.959
(Holly)
'No, it's not.'

11:04.041 --> 11:05.166
Holly, this time
last year

11:05.250 --> 11:08.291
I was standing
right where you
are.

11:08.375 --> 11:10.792
Did you feel like you'd
just been hit by a truck?

11:10.875 --> 11:14.291
Yeah. He's happy with
them.
He won't leave.

11:14.375 --> 11:16.709
Why does he have affairs
if he's so happy?

11:16.792 --> 11:18.583
(female #1)
'I don't know
his psychology.'

11:18.667 --> 11:21.583
But there's a new
girl
every year.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.083
And the
year's
almost over.

11:26.417 --> 11:28.291
I think it's different
this time.

11:32.834 --> 11:36.417
I felt for her.
I-I was her at one point.

11:36.500 --> 11:40.208
But she was upset at him.
Not the other way around.

11:44.041 --> 11:46.041
So, after two
hours
of making copies

11:46.125 --> 11:48.166
of every page from
this Norristown job--

11:48.250 --> 11:50.417
Stillman told us
about the flat tire.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.542
Yeah, that precinct's copier
was from the mimeograph era.

11:53.625 --> 11:54.792
Look, guys,
it was bad
luck.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.792
Yeah, well, we finish
up
your dog call.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.667
Finally, get out of
traffic on Ridge
Pike.

11:58.750 --> 12:01.041
Prostitute's name
was Lenore Grandy.

12:01.125 --> 12:03.583
And bam! And we were
in the fast lane.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.291
Vera, Jeffries, thank you.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.375
You risked your very lives
for this job.

12:07.458 --> 12:10.000
Hey, guys, can we talk
about Lenore Grandy now?

12:10.083 --> 12:11.458
Whipped 14 times
with a car antenna

12:11.542 --> 12:12.667
then
strangled
with it.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.458
And dumped in the Schuylkill.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.583
That's just like Holly.

12:16.667 --> 12:17.959
Here's the money.

12:20.375 --> 12:23.417
Lenore...Holly..

12:29.375 --> 12:31.458
- Wow.
- Yeah.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.166
- Gotta be the same doer.
- How did no one catch this?

12:34.250 --> 12:35.917
Different counties.
Computers don't talk.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.834
Roy Menard have an alibi
for the second murder?

12:37.917 --> 12:39.834
He was teaching his class
that night. It checked out.

12:39.917 --> 12:41.542
Maybe, he did get
the jewel treatment.

12:44.291 --> 12:46.333
- Got something we can work.
- Yeah.

12:46.417 --> 12:49.000
Cross-referenced the names
from vice sweeps in Norristown

12:49.083 --> 12:50.750
with the university
alumni records.

12:50.834 --> 12:52.000
Two hits.

12:52.083 --> 12:54.917
Clarence Grimes.
Graduated 20 years ago.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.500
(Jeffries)
'He wouldn't know Holly.'

12:56.583 --> 12:58.917
Yeah, but Barry Tepler would.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.041
He was in school
same time as her.

13:01.125 --> 13:04.083
He only lives eight blocks
from where Lenore was dumped.

13:07.542 --> 13:10.583
I don't have...people over.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.875
We're here about
Holly Richardson.

13:15.959 --> 13:18.417
- Don't bring her up.
- Why not?

13:18.500 --> 13:21.041
I'd stay away from Holly,
just like she told me to.

13:21.125 --> 13:23.166
Holly told you
to stay away, Barry?

13:23.250 --> 13:25.792
She invited me home
for Thanksgiving.

13:25.875 --> 13:28.000
I misinterpreted her
gesture of friendship..

13:28.083 --> 13:30.125
...for a-a deeper interest

13:30.208 --> 13:33.583
but I changed my behavior when
she relayed her true feelings.

13:35.458 --> 13:39.709
- Your therapist tell you
that?
- Or a lawyer?

13:39.792 --> 13:41.583
When she asked me

13:41.667 --> 13:44.208
to leave her alone...
I did.

13:50.625 --> 13:53.542
- Hi.
- What you doin' here?

13:53.625 --> 13:55.125
I go to school here.

13:55.208 --> 13:57.750
Well, you don't have any
classes in Williams Hall.

13:57.834 --> 14:01.458
- I wanted to see you.
- Barry, you're following me.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.500
I like you.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.375
I'm not interested in
you
in that way.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.667
You took me
to meet your parents.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.250
It was Thanksgiving.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.500
You had nowhere else to go.

14:11.583 --> 14:12.750
Well, can we talk
about it, or--

14:12.834 --> 14:13.917
No. Nope.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.083
I don't wanna
talk about it

14:15.166 --> 14:16.709
I don't want you
to call me or follow me.

14:16.792 --> 14:17.792
Uh-huh.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.917
And I don't want
any more letters.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.792
- Those are yours.
- No, they're yours.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.208
(Valens)
'So, you stalked Holly?'

14:37.291 --> 14:40.709
I pursued her with
too much enthusiasm.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.834
You still have
those letters,
Barry?

14:42.917 --> 14:44.166
No.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.250
You save dental
reminders
from three years ago

14:46.333 --> 14:48.208
but not those letters?

14:49.959 --> 14:54.208
I...I was in my dorm
room
when she was killed.

14:54.291 --> 14:56.750
Where were you when
Lenore Grandy was killed?

14:56.834 --> 14:59.291
- I don't know who that is.
- A hooker.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.667
Murdered December 30,
eight blocks from here.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.291
That's a Tuesday.
Tuesdays I paint.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.875
I have therapy at five

15:06.959 --> 15:09.125
then I go to Wawa
for a Red Bull.

15:09.208 --> 15:12.000
Uh, get a Newsweek,
I'm home by 10:00.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.500
Plenty of time for prostitutes
in that schedule.

15:15.291 --> 15:16.875
I don't use prostitutes.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.875
Risperdal.
You got schizophrenia?

15:23.417 --> 15:25.375
- Yeah.
- Hear voices?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.333
God talking through
the garbage?

15:27.417 --> 15:29.166
- I'm better now.
- It's tough getting
better.

15:29.250 --> 15:30.500
You stop taking these

15:30.583 --> 15:32.375
you can fall into
psychotic behavior.

15:32.458 --> 15:33.583
I take 'em.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.166
Or maybe, you lapsed
right around December 30

15:35.250 --> 15:36.542
voices started saying
you should hurt that hooker.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.667
I don't go
near
those whores!

15:40.250 --> 15:41.500
Yeah, he comes here
all the time.

15:41.583 --> 15:43.750
Hangs around and
tries to talk to
us.

15:43.834 --> 15:45.166
He ever talk to your
friend Lenore?

15:45.250 --> 15:47.083
Oh, he
especially
liked her.

15:47.166 --> 15:49.041
Stared at her from
across the street.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.959
- He the one killed her?
- Uh, we don't know.

15:52.041 --> 15:54.542
I figured it was a
bad
John who did it.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.709
Alright. This kid was never
Lenore's trick?

15:56.792 --> 15:59.208
Mm-mm. He walked up
to her once, though.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.375
Said he loved
her
flaxen hair

16:01.458 --> 16:02.875
and asked would she
go back with him.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.291
- She go?
- Hell, no!

16:04.375 --> 16:06.959
He didn't have no money.

16:07.041 --> 16:10.041
Man! I never would've thought
it could've been this creep.

16:10.125 --> 16:11.750
We don't know that
it is, Trish.

16:11.834 --> 16:14.959
You know, I thought you
guys
would've blown Lenore off.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.000
Dead hooker,
who cares?

16:17.083 --> 16:18.625
No one's
getting
blown off.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.750
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.208
Get in.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.834
Hey! Not you, her.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.500
Tight fit in here, huh?

16:49.583 --> 16:52.417
I'm not staying
anywhere right now.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.250
Lenore and me met while we
was studying to be
beauticians.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.875
We hit if off right away.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.542
Look.
That's us.

17:01.625 --> 17:04.500
Mm-hmm.
Best friends,
huh?

17:04.583 --> 17:06.792
Figured you should have
a real picture of her

17:06.875 --> 17:08.333
not some mug shot.

17:09.834 --> 17:13.166
- What's this one?
- Oh, Lenore had this rich
John.

17:13.250 --> 17:16.041
He was gonna divorce, so he gave
Lenore the diamond earrings

17:16.125 --> 17:17.625
he had just bought
for his wife.

17:17.709 --> 17:19.166
- Nice.
- Yeah.

17:19.250 --> 17:22.542
Instead of just keeping it
for herself, she gives me one.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.542
We made friendship rings...
but for the belly.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.208
Lenore had
the other one,
huh?

17:29.291 --> 17:32.125
She wore it all the time.

17:32.208 --> 17:35.834
Any mention of a diamond belly
ring in the Norristown report?

17:35.917 --> 17:38.667
Uh, no.
Doer probably took it.

17:46.041 --> 17:48.667
- You the detectives?
- Rush and Valens.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.125
This is difficult for us.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.959
- We only had one child.
- We understand.

17:58.041 --> 17:59.625
We already know
who killed our daughter.

17:59.709 --> 18:02.917
Uh, we have another
suspect
we wanna ask you about.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.166
Hmm.
Maybe, I wasn't clear.

18:06.250 --> 18:09.083
Roy Minard killed Holly.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.291
Maybe, I wasn't clear.

18:11.375 --> 18:14.208
We're Homicide and we're
looking at someone else.

18:14.291 --> 18:17.625
- Who?
- Barry Tepler.

18:17.709 --> 18:18.834
He went to college
with Holly.

18:18.917 --> 18:20.792
He was here
for Thanksgiving.

18:20.875 --> 18:22.208
That kid was harmless.

18:22.291 --> 18:23.917
Mr. Richardson, if someone
else is responsible

18:24.000 --> 18:25.166
don't you want to know that?

18:25.250 --> 18:28.083
I know who killed Holly.
A father knows.

18:31.750 --> 18:34.000
Well, Barry was infatuated
with your daughter.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.333
So was Minard.

18:36.417 --> 18:38.959
(Holly)
'I'll come back early,
if you break the rules'

18:39.041 --> 18:40.834
and come see a movie
with me in public.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.375
I gotta go.
My mom has the cake out.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.250
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

18:53.959 --> 18:55.208
A ticket to Paris?

18:57.291 --> 19:00.250
- Who was that on the phone?
- A friend from school.

19:00.333 --> 19:02.750
A man called
for
you earlier.

19:02.834 --> 19:04.750
Dad, I'm not a kid.

19:04.834 --> 19:06.709
Then talk to me
like an adult.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.250
Um, he is my Art History
professor.

19:16.333 --> 19:18.709
He seduced her.

19:18.792 --> 19:20.583
He fell in love with her.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.250
And who wouldn't?

19:22.333 --> 19:26.375
'She was just
so damn special.'

19:26.458 --> 19:29.166
Thought you kept your home
and campus life separate, Roy.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.125
Not even a phone
call.
Ain't that what he
said?

19:31.208 --> 19:32.291
That's right.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.417
Except you called Holly
on her birthday.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.542
- At her parents' house.
- That's right, I did.

19:39.375 --> 19:40.625
Open book.

19:40.709 --> 19:43.208
- Remember, Roy?
- I'd forgotten about that.

19:43.291 --> 19:45.041
And maybe you were a little
more invested in Holly

19:45.125 --> 19:46.375
than you're tellin' us.

19:46.458 --> 19:48.000
You got some other
motive here, Minard?

19:49.792 --> 19:53.625
My motive was to get my life
and my career back.

19:53.709 --> 19:56.417
As far as the phone call's
concerned, Holly..

19:56.500 --> 19:58.750
...insisted that I call her
on her birthday.

19:58.834 --> 20:02.083
Said if didn't,
she was going to call me.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.583
So what? You said your
wife knew about the
affairs.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.542
Knowing about it
in the back of your mind

20:06.625 --> 20:09.083
and hearing a girl's
voice on the line

20:09.166 --> 20:10.792
they're two different things.

20:10.875 --> 20:12.667
(Rush)
'Holly told her dad
she broke things off'

20:12.750 --> 20:14.250
with you in April.

20:14.333 --> 20:16.417
But you were still
going strong in May.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.542
You'd tell your dad the truth
about your sex life?

20:19.625 --> 20:21.458
What's all that?

20:24.875 --> 20:27.625
Two hundred
and twenty-eight..

20:27.709 --> 20:31.125
...articles on Roy Minard.

20:31.208 --> 20:32.667
Murderer.

20:35.375 --> 20:38.834
"President's Award
for an Outstanding
Lecturer."

20:38.917 --> 20:41.333
Why can't they put
that on the news?

20:41.417 --> 20:43.083
People like a story.

20:45.417 --> 20:48.375
You're a postmodernist.

20:48.458 --> 20:49.667
A what?

20:49.750 --> 20:51.625
Well, that's the crux
of the theory, anyway.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.333
Social construction
of reality.

20:53.417 --> 20:57.291
- What are you talking about?
- Society needs a narrative.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.458
You know, given seemingly
random facts and events

20:59.542 --> 21:02.542
we need to weave them
into a story.

21:04.417 --> 21:08.250
Otherwise, the world
wouldn't make any sense.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.667
I can see that.

21:09.750 --> 21:13.875
How do we process this
beautiful young girl
dying?

21:13.959 --> 21:15.500
We can't.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.667
Not without a perpetrator.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.667
And so, if one isn't
obvious,
we find one.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.583
We assign the blame.
It makes the story
complete.

21:22.667 --> 21:26.208
It's an action.
Explanation.
Order restored.

21:26.291 --> 21:28.792
Why people gotta
believe in God, too.

21:28.875 --> 21:32.041
Mm-hmm, exactly.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.875
Too many un-answerables
without him.

21:35.959 --> 21:37.875
Makes some sense.

21:37.959 --> 21:39.959
Well, I'd be even more
fascinated if I weren't

21:40.041 --> 21:43.875
the foil of it all,
but, yes, it does.

21:43.959 --> 21:45.417
It makes some sense.

21:50.250 --> 21:52.291
(Rush)
'Kite!'

21:52.375 --> 21:55.125
Uh, office is closed, Rush.

21:55.208 --> 21:56.834
Seven O'clock?

21:56.917 --> 21:59.375
Yeah, well, spare me
<i>mantra.</i>

21:59.458 --> 22:01.875
"When your day ends,
ours just begins."

22:01.959 --> 22:04.625
- It's true.
- Yeah, I've seen the
T-shirt.

22:04.709 --> 22:06.709
Well, I don't know
what I'd do with myself

22:06.792 --> 22:08.834
if I went home at 7:00.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.875
Uh, you remember
the Holly Richardson job?

22:12.959 --> 22:14.834
Yeah, everybody
wanted that one.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.792
Why?
There's nothing on it.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.834
Pretty Ivy League girl,
philandering professor

22:18.917 --> 22:20.709
kind of case
gets you on Court
TV.

22:20.792 --> 22:21.792
Where you'd look like a fool

22:21.875 --> 22:23.583
'cause the Commonwealth
had crap?

22:23.667 --> 22:25.166
I guess.
Have you eaten?

22:25.250 --> 22:27.250
Uh, look, I need a search
warrant on this kid Barry.

22:27.333 --> 22:28.875
Um, do you know
any Norristown DA's?

22:28.959 --> 22:30.750
- 'Cause I haven't eaten.
- I need it right away.

22:30.834 --> 22:33.125
This kid knows
we're looking at him.

22:33.208 --> 22:34.917
Sit with me.
We'll run the
case.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.834
Or we can do it tomorrow.
I've got 15 minutes at
4:30.

22:48.583 --> 22:50.709
Barry Tepler fits
for both jobs.

22:50.792 --> 22:53.000
Huh, I got a
narrative on
him.

22:53.083 --> 22:53.959
A what?

22:54.041 --> 22:55.417
A story that adds up.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.625
He had it bad
for Holly,
right?

22:57.709 --> 22:59.250
Gets rejected by her

22:59.333 --> 23:00.625
then he's hanging
around this hooker

23:00.709 --> 23:01.959
Lenore, the last few months.

23:02.041 --> 23:03.375
Who he claims
he didn't know.

23:03.458 --> 23:05.125
Who also rejected him.

23:05.208 --> 23:07.000
Both girls end up
dead in the water.

23:07.083 --> 23:08.375
Well, if he's
so in love with 'em

23:08.458 --> 23:10.625
why no sexual element
to these murders?

23:10.709 --> 23:12.458
Well, Barry's schizophrenic.

23:12.542 --> 23:14.709
A lot of people with that
condition, no sex drive.

23:14.792 --> 23:16.333
And the voices you
hear,
they're powerful.

23:16.417 --> 23:18.792
They tell you to
kill someone, you do
it.

23:20.792 --> 23:22.875
You're knowledgeable, huh?

23:24.500 --> 23:26.208
Yeah.

23:26.291 --> 23:27.709
I know someone.

23:29.208 --> 23:30.291
Where's Lil?

23:30.375 --> 23:31.792
Uh, she's getting a
warrant for Barry's.

23:31.875 --> 23:35.125
To find the hooker's belly
ring,
those letters to Holly.

23:35.208 --> 23:36.542
Maybe he starts ownin' up.

23:36.625 --> 23:39.000
Huh. Alright.
Goodnight, Scotty.

23:39.083 --> 23:40.166
Yeah.

23:44.333 --> 23:46.750
So, Roy Minard
is innocent after all?

23:46.834 --> 23:47.959
I don't assume anything.

23:48.041 --> 23:51.250
But this Barry kid makes..

23:51.333 --> 23:53.166
...more sense.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.250
So what's he like, Minard?

23:56.500 --> 23:58.333
Kind of a cad.

23:58.417 --> 23:59.959
But a charming one?

24:00.041 --> 24:02.000
I guess.

24:02.083 --> 24:06.458
So you figure a guy's bad news
if he mixes work and pleasure?

24:06.542 --> 24:08.625
I don't have a
big
opinion on that.

24:08.709 --> 24:11.166
Hmm.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.500
So, uh, I'll call this
Norristown guy in the
morning.

24:13.583 --> 24:15.166
How come we always
talk about work?

24:15.250 --> 24:16.709
'Cause we work together.

24:16.792 --> 24:18.583
Well, tell me
something personal.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.291
No.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.583
Why not?

24:23.458 --> 24:26.041
Come on, Rush.
Why not?

24:26.125 --> 24:27.625
[laughing]
Because..

24:27.709 --> 24:29.750
I'm bad at it. And..

24:32.834 --> 24:33.875
I gotta go.

24:33.959 --> 24:35.709
- Well, let me walk you.
- I'll be fine!

24:35.792 --> 24:38.959
- I'm packin'.
- Uh, watch..

24:39.041 --> 24:40.333
I know.

24:40.417 --> 24:42.834
Stand still, okay?

24:42.917 --> 24:44.750
What are you doing?

24:44.834 --> 24:46.208
I'm gonna kiss you.

24:46.291 --> 24:48.250
- No.
- Just give it a try.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.542
[laughing
]
A try..

24:52.625 --> 24:54.875
- Come on.
- Come on, Rush.

24:54.959 --> 24:56.834
All you, gotta do
is stand there.

24:56.917 --> 24:58.166
Don't panic.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.709
It's over in three seconds.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.375
Um..

25:36.458 --> 25:40.333
So, sit with that
overnight and, uh

25:41.709 --> 25:43.625
see how...it settles in.

25:49.792 --> 25:50.959
Ahem.

26:00.792 --> 26:03.125
Everything has its
place.
Everything has its..

26:03.208 --> 26:04.583
Everything has its place!

26:04.667 --> 26:07.792
(Rush)
'Read the warrant.
We got a right.'

26:07.875 --> 26:09.875
Why are you doing this to me?
What did I do wrong?

26:09.959 --> 26:12.000
You lied about that
flaxen-haired hooker.

26:12.083 --> 26:15.583
- Asking her home and all.
- I just wanted to paint
her.

26:20.583 --> 26:22.458
Pay dirt.

26:22.542 --> 26:24.875
Guess you lied about having
these letters to Holly, too.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.500
Please don't take those.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.208
Got to read 'em, Barry.

26:31.333 --> 26:33.208
They sent you to ruin my life.

26:35.166 --> 26:36.250
I know.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.917
They watch outside
in the shadows

26:39.000 --> 26:40.875
in the closet,
behind the coats..

26:40.959 --> 26:42.333
Stress is
bringing
on an episode.

26:42.417 --> 26:43.709
You think I can't hear them?

26:43.792 --> 26:44.875
Take him out for
some air, will you?

26:44.959 --> 26:47.458
That high pitch? Huh?

26:47.542 --> 26:48.750
Like a whistle?

26:48.834 --> 26:50.792
you

26:56.917 --> 26:58.959
What's it say?

27:02.291 --> 27:04.083
"To my Holly.

27:04.166 --> 27:06.834
"If thou wilt needs marry,
marry a fool.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.750
"For wise men
know well enough

27:08.834 --> 27:11.208
what monsters
you make of them."

27:11.291 --> 27:12.709
Some kind of poetry?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.542
Maybe Shakespeare?

27:16.625 --> 27:18.917
No belly ring at Barry's?

27:19.000 --> 27:21.041
Hmm. Turned his place
inside out.

27:21.125 --> 27:22.500
Maybe sold it for cash.

27:22.583 --> 27:26.125
"Who set this ancient
quarrel new abroach?"

27:26.208 --> 27:28.041
What the hell? I thought this
was about a girl on a balcony.

27:28.125 --> 27:30.000
Just find the quote
from Barry's letter.

27:30.083 --> 27:33.166
Wait. Hold up.
"Is your name Shylock?"

27:33.250 --> 27:35.000
- That's not the quote.
- 'I know.'

27:35.083 --> 27:37.542
It's the first thing I've
understood in about an
hour.

27:37.625 --> 27:39.208
It's here, in "Hamlet."

27:39.291 --> 27:40.500
Thank god.

27:40.583 --> 27:42.709
"If thou wilt needs marry,
marry a fool.

27:42.792 --> 27:46.917
"For wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.917
To a nunnery, go,
and quickly, too."

27:51.000 --> 27:52.917
Hamlet says it to Ophelia.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.542
And it looks like it was
a one-sided kind of love.

27:55.625 --> 27:56.709
He rejects her.

27:56.792 --> 27:58.083
But Barry was
the one
rejected.

27:58.166 --> 27:59.250
(Rush)
Right.

27:59.333 --> 28:02.375
Flip to the back.
How's it end?

28:02.458 --> 28:05.500
Uh, she...goes mad
and drowns.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.750
Both our vics were
found in the drink.

28:07.834 --> 28:10.417
"The drink?"
You the bard now?

28:10.500 --> 28:13.125
Monster could mean...
Barry's illness.

28:13.208 --> 28:14.417
He blames it on Holly?

28:14.500 --> 28:15.500
Let's find out.

28:15.583 --> 28:17.125
About that belly ring.

28:17.208 --> 28:19.375
Scotty's right.
Barry could've sold it.

28:19.458 --> 28:20.917
You wanna check
consignment and pawn shops?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.083
Yeah.

28:22.166 --> 28:24.250
Once I'm finished with
this scintillating play.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.583
- Sellin' or buyin'?
- Buyin'.

28:28.667 --> 28:31.417
Pawn shop on the corner said
you might have what we want.

28:32.709 --> 28:34.125
Don't give that schmuck
your business.

28:34.208 --> 28:36.458
Schmuck that has this

28:36.542 --> 28:38.834
diamond belly ring..

28:38.917 --> 28:40.208
...is the one
gets our business.

28:41.583 --> 28:43.291
Just got some
vintage
cufflinks.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.917
The belly ring.
That's all we
want.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.542
You're missing out, fellas.
They're Tiger Eye.

28:49.875 --> 28:52.041
[whispers]
Yeah.

28:52.125 --> 28:55.667
- This what you had in mind?
- Yeah.

28:55.750 --> 28:58.458
- Exactly.
- Nice stone. Two carats.

28:58.542 --> 29:00.083
How much?

29:00.166 --> 29:03.083
- Ten Bens.
- Call the seller.

29:03.166 --> 29:05.542
Tell him to come down
here
and collect his dough.

29:05.625 --> 29:08.291
So you saw you and
Holly
as a kinda modern-day

29:08.375 --> 29:09.709
Hamlet and Ophelia, huh?

29:09.792 --> 29:11.208
So?

29:11.291 --> 29:13.792
It didn't end well for
that chick in the play,
Barry.

29:13.875 --> 29:15.250
It didn't end well
for Holly, either.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.917
It's just a letter.

29:18.750 --> 29:21.834
"Wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them."

29:21.917 --> 29:23.917
You saying she made
you into a monster?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.542
No, passion.
Passion is the monster.

29:27.917 --> 29:29.583
I just, I..

29:29.667 --> 29:31.542
I wanted to get her attention

29:31.625 --> 29:33.667
show her I was sensitive.

29:33.750 --> 29:36.667
Not like that old...guy
she was seeing.

29:36.750 --> 29:39.500
Oh, you knew about Minard?

29:39.583 --> 29:40.959
He shouldn't date students.

29:41.041 --> 29:43.083
It's not an
equal relationship.

29:45.083 --> 29:46.625
So when Holly
was stupid enough

29:46.709 --> 29:48.959
not to be moved by
your borrowed
poetry..

29:49.041 --> 29:50.583
Throw those letters
back in your face.

29:50.667 --> 29:53.333
When she stayed in her
unequal
relationship with Minard

29:53.417 --> 29:55.041
and told you to
leave
her the hell alone

29:55.125 --> 29:56.375
you wanted to punish her.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.041
Followed her that night,
snapped off an antenna.

29:58.125 --> 30:00.750
Then whip, whip, whip.
Strangle, strangle.

30:00.834 --> 30:02.000
Splash.

30:06.291 --> 30:08.041
I saw her that night.

30:10.834 --> 30:12.792
But I only talked to her.

30:16.458 --> 30:19.458
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

30:21.208 --> 30:22.875
Well, I know I'm not
supposed to come near you--

30:22.959 --> 30:24.458
No, it's alright, you can.

30:29.917 --> 30:32.417
I, uh..

30:32.500 --> 30:33.458
Oh..

30:36.875 --> 30:38.125
What happened?

30:41.291 --> 30:43.583
I found out
what a bitch I am.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.792
You're not a bitch.

30:45.875 --> 30:49.291
I saw Minard's wife.
And their kid.

30:50.166 --> 30:52.500
They're real.

30:52.583 --> 30:54.750
I pretended
they weren't, but..

30:54.834 --> 30:55.917
...they're a family.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.667
That guy's not
right
for you anyway.

30:57.750 --> 31:00.417
Oh.
Well, he doesn't think so.

31:00.500 --> 31:03.250
- He wants to stay together.
- Really?

31:06.250 --> 31:08.625
You know, the truth is..

31:08.709 --> 31:10.417
I don't care about him.

31:11.583 --> 31:13.417
I was just playing a game.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.041
And I, I don't love him.

31:17.458 --> 31:18.834
Maybe..

31:23.250 --> 31:25.250
Maybe you could love me.

31:26.834 --> 31:28.291
No.

31:29.166 --> 31:31.792
I'll never love you, either.

31:41.208 --> 31:44.041
Girl you love says
that to you and you
just..

31:44.125 --> 31:46.208
...get up and go
back to the dorm?

31:46.291 --> 31:47.500
Yeah.

31:47.583 --> 31:50.291
Oh, we didn't
hear
it like that,
Barry.

31:50.375 --> 31:54.458
We heard Holly was pissed
off
at Minard after that party.

31:54.542 --> 31:56.542
Lil.

32:01.625 --> 32:02.542
What's going on?

32:02.625 --> 32:03.917
Holly's mother called.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.083
I won't fight you.

32:10.166 --> 32:11.375
I don't care how
many
times you hit me.

32:11.458 --> 32:13.583
- Mr. Richardson,
- I'm not gonna hit you.

32:13.667 --> 32:14.959
This won't solve anything.

32:15.041 --> 32:16.834
You won't take care
of this guy, I'll do it
myself.

32:16.917 --> 32:19.291
I am taking care of it.
I'm reinvestigating.

32:19.375 --> 32:21.208
Holly was an innocent girl

32:21.291 --> 32:24.542
and this bastard...
took advantage of her.

32:24.625 --> 32:26.875
I was wrong, okay?
I shouldn't have been with
her.

32:26.959 --> 32:28.417
You have every reason
to hate me for that.

32:28.500 --> 32:31.458
- But I did not hurt Holly.
- Don't say that.

32:31.542 --> 32:34.083
I know you did it.
I know it.

32:34.166 --> 32:37.083
Please let me handle this.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.583
I miss her.

32:43.125 --> 32:44.291
I know.

32:52.458 --> 32:54.667
Holly was special.

32:54.750 --> 32:57.166
'Maybe you don't want
to hear that from me.'

32:57.250 --> 32:58.917
But she talked about
you.
All the time.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.125
She adored you.

33:08.458 --> 33:09.542
I know he did it.

33:19.625 --> 33:23.208
Whoa.
Hey. Ha-ha.

33:23.291 --> 33:24.250
Did you get that warrant okay?

33:24.333 --> 33:25.417
- I did.
- Alright.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.417
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.000
I guess we won't talk
about the other thing.

33:29.083 --> 33:30.166
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

33:30.250 --> 33:32.000
Punk!

33:32.083 --> 33:34.083
<i>Tu hermana</i>
<i>es un stupido, abuelo.</i>

33:34.166 --> 33:36.083
Shut...up!

33:37.834 --> 33:40.000
Who is this?

33:40.083 --> 33:42.291
Jesus Torres. Ex-con.

33:42.375 --> 33:44.750
Tried to sell
Lenore Grandy's belly ring.

33:45.959 --> 33:47.458
What's he sayin'?

33:47.542 --> 33:49.875
Somethin' not so nice
about Vera's sister.

33:52.041 --> 33:55.125
Well, looks like you got
two suspects now.

33:56.583 --> 33:59.750
This ring belonged
to Lenore Grandy.

33:59.834 --> 34:02.375
The hooker you killed
up in Norristown.

34:02.458 --> 34:05.625
I tell you..

34:05.709 --> 34:08.500
Told you.
I didn't kill no
one.

34:08.583 --> 34:11.417
What's your parole officer
gonna think about all this?

34:11.500 --> 34:15.750
Six months out and you already
got ties to two murders.

34:16.875 --> 34:18.458
- Two?
- 'Yeah. Lenore Grandy.'

34:18.542 --> 34:22.417
Two weeks ago, Holly Richardson
in '95. Same doer.

34:22.500 --> 34:26.208
Say "Jesus has not adjusted
to life after prison

34:26.291 --> 34:27.709
in the way we had hoped."

34:31.458 --> 34:35.041
- Maybe I took the diamond.
- 'Now, that's a start.'

34:35.125 --> 34:36.375
Yeah, but it
ain't
like you say.

34:36.458 --> 34:39.291
- Hmm.
- 'What is it like?'

34:42.250 --> 34:45.625
I go to the river,
<i>dead,</i>
already

34:45.709 --> 34:47.583
in the water.

34:47.667 --> 34:49.000
I see the ring.

34:49.083 --> 34:51.959
Think, she don't
need it now,
right?

34:52.041 --> 34:54.500
- Nah, she's iced.
- That's all I do.

34:54.583 --> 34:56.625
I steal from someone
don't need it
anymore.

35:01.041 --> 35:04.125
Now, here's my vision for
what happened.

35:04.208 --> 35:05.625
You met Lenore in your hood

35:05.709 --> 35:07.542
fell in love
with that flaxen hair

35:07.625 --> 35:08.625
which was a lot
like Holly's.

35:08.709 --> 35:10.041
Holly was a honey blonde.

35:10.125 --> 35:12.959
And thought, "Well,
here's a Holly look-alike

35:13.041 --> 35:15.000
"and she's just a hooker.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.750
Maybe I can get this one."

35:16.834 --> 35:19.041
I just wanted to paint
Lenore,
I'm a painter.

35:19.125 --> 35:21.333
But then she gives
you the high hat.

35:21.417 --> 35:24.667
Rejected by a whore.
That's humiliating.

35:24.750 --> 35:26.250
The last straw.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.542
So you figure,
let me give this
bitch

35:27.625 --> 35:29.542
'the same treatment
I gave Holly.'

35:45.375 --> 35:48.000
I got to show you somethin'.

35:48.083 --> 35:51.166
You study the
pre-Raphaelites there, Jesus?

35:51.250 --> 35:52.917
Que?

35:55.083 --> 35:58.667
John Everett Millais
one of your favorites?

35:58.750 --> 36:01.208
It's called "Ophelia".

36:01.291 --> 36:03.542
I never saw that.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.750
Yeah, but you do
recognize that, uh

36:05.834 --> 36:09.208
Lenore was posed
just like poor Ophelia here.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.542
I don't know
nothing
about paintings.

36:14.208 --> 36:15.917
No?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.333
All I did
was
steal the
ring.

36:18.417 --> 36:20.333
She was layin'
in the water..

36:20.417 --> 36:22.542
Lying in the
water,
already dead.

36:22.625 --> 36:25.083
Say that again.

36:25.166 --> 36:28.125
She was lyin'
in the water
dead.

36:28.208 --> 36:30.917
- Chickens lay.
- People lie.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.667
You take ESL with Mr. Roy?

36:32.750 --> 36:34.792
<i>Nada.</i>
- 'Hey, look.'

36:34.875 --> 36:36.083
(Valens)
'It's easy to prove, Jesus.'

36:36.166 --> 36:37.500
'There's a registry for that.'

36:37.583 --> 36:40.041
You and him made a deal,
didn't you?

36:40.125 --> 36:41.625
'Murder for hire
gets you the death penalty'

36:41.709 --> 36:43.625
'nine times
out of ten, Jesus.'

36:43.709 --> 36:46.208
Lucky part for you is,
we want Roy more than you.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.667
Tell your side,
we tell the DA you cooperated.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.667
I done this before.
10,000.

37:08.750 --> 37:12.166
(Minard)
'I can't do ten.
Five maybe.'

37:12.250 --> 37:15.667
Come on, it...it's a hooker.

37:15.750 --> 37:17.458
It'll be the easiest
money you've ever made.

37:19.542 --> 37:21.959
It's so easy, you do it.

37:22.041 --> 37:23.583
And it'll cost you nothing.

37:23.667 --> 37:27.166
I have to be in class
to establish my alibi.

37:31.458 --> 37:34.083
Okay. I do for six.

37:35.583 --> 37:38.834
Alright, but remember,
you stick to the script.

37:38.917 --> 37:40.083
Everything's got to be done

37:40.166 --> 37:41.500
exactly the way
it was last time.

37:41.583 --> 37:44.375
<i>- 'Comprende, Jesus?'</i>
<i>- Si.</i>

37:44.458 --> 37:47.792
(Minard)
'You know, I end up teaching
this pathetic class, and,
uh..'

37:47.875 --> 37:50.834
It was all to meet you,
my friend.

37:52.291 --> 37:54.166
That's destiny.

37:54.250 --> 37:57.458
I'll be back after this.

37:57.542 --> 37:59.000
Where I belong.

37:59.083 --> 38:02.166
Minard, what's destiny?

38:02.250 --> 38:03.917
It's what sets you free.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
I thought it was truth.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.625
Truth sets you free.

38:07.709 --> 38:09.709
No. It's destiny.
Trust me.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.208
He only pay me 3,000.

38:16.291 --> 38:19.834
So, I figure
I deserved the jewelry.

38:19.917 --> 38:21.083
Seems only fair.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.417
(Rush)
'Back inside the ivy walls?'

38:27.500 --> 38:30.458
Yeah, I had
a...lunch
with the dean.

38:31.917 --> 38:32.959
I don't want to
appear too
hopeful

38:33.041 --> 38:34.041
but the head
of my old
department

38:34.125 --> 38:35.417
is stepping
down
in the fall.

38:35.500 --> 38:36.750
Getting your name cleared
would help a lot, huh?

38:36.834 --> 38:38.208
Oh, it couldn't hurt.

38:38.291 --> 38:41.667
You'll be glad to know
we have someone in custody.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.542
No.
Who is
it?

38:43.625 --> 38:45.875
Jesus Torres.

38:45.959 --> 38:47.583
A student in your ESL class.

38:47.667 --> 38:49.875
Jesus...Jesus, no.

38:49.959 --> 38:51.709
I-I'm sorry, that
doesn't
ring a bell.

38:51.792 --> 38:53.041
(Rush)
'That's not what he says.'

38:53.125 --> 38:55.792
He says you told him
you killed Holly.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.125
What?

38:57.208 --> 39:00.625
And hired him to kill Lenore
in a copycat killing.

39:00.709 --> 39:03.667
That..
That's
absurd.

39:03.750 --> 39:05.417
Well, I know you are
the brilliant professor

39:05.500 --> 39:06.917
and we're just dumb cops.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.291
I don't think you're dumb.

39:08.375 --> 39:09.583
Who couldn't possibly
have heard of Ophelia.

39:09.667 --> 39:11.458
I don't think you're dumb.

39:11.542 --> 39:13.834
I just think you're
falling for a story.

39:15.792 --> 39:17.792
Almost, Minard.

39:17.875 --> 39:19.583
I almost fell
for your story.

39:19.667 --> 39:22.542
But your boy, Jesus,
screwed up your plan.

39:22.625 --> 39:24.583
And he got greedy, stole
something off the body.

39:24.667 --> 39:26.083
'Led us back to you.'

39:26.166 --> 39:28.625
Jesus is a lifetime criminal

39:28.709 --> 39:30.291
with a third-world education.

39:30.375 --> 39:32.083
Thought you didn't know him.

39:32.166 --> 39:34.959
You have his
word against
mine.

39:35.041 --> 39:37.125
- It hardly makes a case.
- No.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.875
But the second body being
posed just like the first?

39:39.959 --> 39:40.959
That makes my case.

39:41.041 --> 39:43.041
The public didn't know
those details.

39:43.125 --> 39:44.458
Only Holly's killer did.

39:44.542 --> 39:46.291
And who's gonna believe
a dummy like Jesus

39:46.375 --> 39:48.125
ever studied art history?

40:03.542 --> 40:05.000
I had to regain my station.

40:05.083 --> 40:06.792
And Jesus offered
a way to do that.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.750
You knew about Barry's
letters to Holly.

40:08.834 --> 40:10.166
Calling her his "Ophelia."

40:10.250 --> 40:12.417
She showed me
a few of them.

40:14.125 --> 40:16.000
Pillow talk, if you will.

40:16.083 --> 40:20.000
So you just needed to find
another girl to link Barry
to.

40:20.083 --> 40:23.500
Make it look like
she was his second Ophelia.

40:23.583 --> 40:25.208
(Valens)
'Frame him for both.'

40:25.291 --> 40:28.333
Guy's just a schizo,
what's his life worth, anyway?

40:29.750 --> 40:30.917
I contribute.

40:32.417 --> 40:35.125
Don't look at me like
I'm some kind of monster.

40:35.208 --> 40:37.792
Holly shares some
of the blame of this, too.

40:37.875 --> 40:40.750
Oh, really?
What'd Holly do?

40:42.625 --> 40:44.417
She made me love her.

41:08.875 --> 41:11.333
You left angry.

41:11.417 --> 41:12.792
I could tell.

41:14.125 --> 41:15.750
What?
What's wrong?

41:15.834 --> 41:18.875
Nothing's wrong.
It's just over.

41:20.917 --> 41:24.208
- What makes you say that?
- You have a wife.

41:30.208 --> 41:32.000
- Then I'll leave her for
you.
- No.

41:32.083 --> 41:34.709
I will. I will.
I really will.

41:34.792 --> 41:37.917
I thought I loved you,
but it was in a childish way.

41:39.500 --> 41:42.500
You know, this hard-to-get act
is a little juvenile for you.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.250
You know, I just
wanted to have fun.

41:44.333 --> 41:46.250
I didn't even think
about your family.

41:46.333 --> 41:47.667
Hey.

41:49.083 --> 41:52.250
Did you hear what I just
said,
that I love you?

41:52.333 --> 41:54.875
Well, I don't love you.
I don't love anyone.

41:54.959 --> 41:56.709
Except yourself.

41:56.792 --> 41:57.750
Yeah, and you love you.

41:57.834 --> 41:59.333
That's why we get
along so well.

42:05.709 --> 42:07.375
I say when it's over.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.208
I make the rules.

42:38.208 --> 42:39.542
I decide.

42:43.458 --> 42:45.000
I decide!

42:46.792 --> 42:48.417
I decide!

43:01.709 --> 43:03.083
I decide.
