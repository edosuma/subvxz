WEBVTT

00:19.750 --> 00:21.625
Well, he's cute, right?

00:33.792 --> 00:34.959
You mind?

00:52.667 --> 00:55.125
Watch this, baby doll.

00:55.208 --> 00:56.959
Leave the new kid alone, Red.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.125
What's your bag, man?

01:00.542 --> 01:02.959
Gloria thinks
the new kid's
cherry.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.417
- 'Oh, yeah.'
- 'Yeah.'

01:07.500 --> 01:10.041
You're thicker than a 5 dollar
malt, surprised you can read.

01:10.125 --> 01:12.041
What the hell?

01:14.166 --> 01:15.959
Look at what we got here.

01:16.041 --> 01:18.792
- He's a she.
- He's a jackass.

02:08.458 --> 02:09.709
(Scotty)
'Boss wants to see me.'

02:09.792 --> 02:11.709
IAD is wrapping it up, finally.

02:11.792 --> 02:13.166
What do you got?

02:13.250 --> 02:14.917
Well, Vera's talking
to this guy..

02:15.000 --> 02:17.291
...info on a floater from '63.

02:17.375 --> 02:20.000
Drowned in a lake at FDR.

02:20.083 --> 02:21.667
(Scotty)
'He got a name?'

02:21.750 --> 02:22.834
She.

02:22.917 --> 02:24.875
Wait, that's a boy.

02:24.959 --> 02:26.417
- Right?
- Wrong.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.291
Samantha Randall, 16.

02:29.375 --> 02:32.375
The body washed up a half-mile
down from the bridge.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.125
Suicide Point that bridge.

02:34.208 --> 02:36.458
Ain't our
jurisdiction
when teenagers jump.

02:36.542 --> 02:39.041
Mm. Only our guy
says she didn't.

02:40.959 --> 02:44.333
I've been a drunk
my whole life, but I..

02:44.417 --> 02:46.792
...I got sober this year.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.417
I got six months.

02:48.500 --> 02:50.542
Good for you.

02:50.625 --> 02:54.083
In AA, they say that you're
only sick as your secrets.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.750
Anytime you want
to get to the point, bub.

02:55.834 --> 02:59.333
The point is, everybody
said that girl jumped

02:59.417 --> 03:02.083
from the bridge,
but she didn't.

03:02.166 --> 03:03.333
And how do you know?

03:03.417 --> 03:05.917
'Cause I was on
the bridge that night.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.750
Well, maybe your
memory's a little fuzzy.

03:09.834 --> 03:14.625
I heard a car pull up
and...then this little
splash.

03:14.709 --> 03:17.291
I look down in the
water
and a girl floats by

03:17.375 --> 03:18.875
right in front of me.

03:20.583 --> 03:22.417
You're here to clear
your conscience, right,
Maurice?

03:22.500 --> 03:25.208
Why don't you save us the song
and dance, admit you did it?

03:25.291 --> 03:29.500
I admit those were dark times,
but not that dark.

03:29.583 --> 03:32.125
The only one
I was killing was myself.

03:37.959 --> 03:39.834
There's no water in her lungs.

03:39.917 --> 03:42.125
And not likely she drowned.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.250
Saying she was dead
when she hit the water?

03:44.333 --> 03:45.709
No one caught it back then?

03:45.792 --> 03:48.500
Mm. Wasn't going for a midnight
swim in this red dress.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.917
So somebody dumped her.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.542
Uh, tough to kill yourself
if you're already dead.

04:36.959 --> 04:38.458
You wanted to see me, boss?

04:38.542 --> 04:39.959
Have a seat, Scotty.

04:42.792 --> 04:45.083
Uh, nah, I'm...good.

04:48.125 --> 04:51.083
IAD is recommending suspension.
30 days, unpaid.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.291
Just like that, huh?

04:53.375 --> 04:54.583
They're citing procedure..

04:54.667 --> 04:56.000
'...perimeter.'

04:56.083 --> 04:58.333
You've been around long
enough to know how it goes.

04:58.417 --> 04:59.750
So, do I just...leave now?

04:59.834 --> 05:02.625
If I thought you were wrong,
you'd be gone by now.

05:05.792 --> 05:07.875
Get back to work.

05:09.500 --> 05:13.375
Yeah, but...
I'm suspended,
right?

05:13.458 --> 05:16.125
recommended

05:16.208 --> 05:20.542
So, you got to come up with a
counteroffer now, or something?

05:20.625 --> 05:22.458
Do your job, Scotty.

05:22.542 --> 05:24.000
Let me do mine.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.792
Samantha Randall
some kids found her body

05:37.875 --> 05:39.750
washed up at FDR park.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.500
Yup, it's a girl.

05:43.583 --> 05:44.667
Not where I come from.

05:44.750 --> 05:47.000
I was a tomboy
when I was
little.

05:47.083 --> 05:48.750
Used to beat
my brothers arm
wrestling.

05:48.834 --> 05:50.917
Guessing you didn't
take it this far, though.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.417
To each their own.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.250
A classmate said Samantha
only wore boys' clothes.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.667
Until the night
she died, that is.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.917
Well, she was
the new kid in town.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.750
Enrolled at Grays
Ferry High School

06:01.834 --> 06:03.166
a couple months before she died.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.792
Kids must've loved her.

06:04.875 --> 06:07.583
The cops ruled it a suicide,
chalked it up to her..

06:07.667 --> 06:08.875
...behavior problem.

06:08.959 --> 06:10.667
Ran away from
home every few weeks.

06:10.750 --> 06:13.250
Had three arrests
for public intoxication.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.458
We thinking she was gay?

06:14.542 --> 06:17.792
Oh, back in '63
that was a disease.

06:17.875 --> 06:20.458
You could've been
acting out, confused.

06:20.542 --> 06:23.250
Doer might've taught
the freak a lesson.

06:23.333 --> 06:26.625
Put her in a dress
to drive the point home.

06:26.709 --> 06:28.000
So how'd she die?

06:28.083 --> 06:31.125
The marks on her temples
might be bruises, burns?

06:32.166 --> 06:34.709
Uh, I'll see
if she got family left.

06:34.792 --> 06:37.041
Find out just how rough
this tomboy had it.

06:37.125 --> 06:38.375
Mm.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.834
Archie Randall?

06:47.917 --> 06:50.125
- You found him.
- Philly Homicide.

06:50.208 --> 06:52.250
I got some questions,
if you don't mind.

06:52.333 --> 06:54.583
Homicide? What is this?

06:54.667 --> 06:57.250
Maybe you'd like
to speak in private.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.208
Finish without me.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.041
I'm looking into
your daughter's death.

07:08.125 --> 07:10.458
I don't understand.

07:10.542 --> 07:13.166
Sam...killed herself.

07:13.250 --> 07:15.834
You told officers she was
having behavior problems.

07:15.917 --> 07:19.375
Well, you would, too, if your
mom died when you were little.

07:19.458 --> 07:21.417
I raised her on my own.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.208
Did the best I could anyway.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.667
Was she always a tomboy?

07:24.750 --> 07:28.208
Hmm. Like the son I never had.

07:28.291 --> 07:32.667
She loved to build tree
forts and play in the
mud.

07:34.667 --> 07:38.500
But...around age
12,
trouble started.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.125
What kind of troubles?

07:40.208 --> 07:44.083
Oh, sassing her teachers and
skipping school and fightin'.

07:45.458 --> 07:49.166
Got kicked out of...a
few
high schools upstate.

07:49.250 --> 07:51.583
That why you moved
to Grays Ferry?

07:51.667 --> 07:54.667
Twice we had to pack up
and move to a new town.

07:54.750 --> 07:57.875
We-we were damn lucky
not to end up in the
poorhouse.

07:57.959 --> 07:59.500
I hope you
don't mind me asking

07:59.583 --> 08:02.208
but Sam's alternative behavior..

08:02.291 --> 08:03.875
...how far did it go?

08:03.959 --> 08:05.458
I'm not sure
I catch your
meaning.

08:05.542 --> 08:09.625
Did your daughter prefer
the company of...other girls?

08:09.709 --> 08:11.542
Oh, no, no, no.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.041
She wasn't one of those.

08:13.125 --> 08:17.041
Can you think of anyone who
would wanna hurt your daughter?

08:17.125 --> 08:19.125
I gotta admit.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.625
Sam didn't have
a lot of
friends.

08:21.709 --> 08:25.083
She always acted like
it was her against the
world.

08:27.875 --> 08:31.750
It's hard adjusting
to a new school.

08:31.834 --> 08:35.125
- Isn't that right, Sam?
- Red picked on me.

08:35.208 --> 08:36.792
So why am I the one
who's brought in
here?

08:36.875 --> 08:39.917
Because you can't come
to school dressed
like...that.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.417
You want me
to dress like a girl

08:41.500 --> 08:43.083
'cause it makes meatheads
like Red feel better?

08:43.166 --> 08:45.583
You'll dress like a girl
because
you are a girl, Samantha.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.417
- It's Sam!
- Sam is a boy's name.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.875
Let's get that straight.

08:48.959 --> 08:50.542
You'll go by Samantha
at this school.

08:50.625 --> 08:54.709
Does your mother ever take you
shopping for clothes, dear?

08:54.792 --> 08:57.583
She has a closet
full of skirts at home.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.917
Price tags are
still on all of them.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.750
Girls like her run into all
kinds of trouble later in
life.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.583
(male #1)
'Personality disorders,
alcohol abuse.'

09:05.667 --> 09:07.458
There are places
that can help her

09:07.542 --> 09:09.625
if she's not
willing to change.

09:09.709 --> 09:12.208
Let's nip this
in the bud now, shall
we?

09:12.291 --> 09:13.625
Why can't I just be who I am?

09:13.709 --> 09:16.500
And who or what
exactly is that?

09:19.208 --> 09:24.208
Now, it says here you've
registered for shop
class?

09:24.291 --> 09:25.917
Yeah, I wanna
learn how to build

09:26.000 --> 09:27.208
a turbo engine from scratch.

09:27.291 --> 09:28.583
I've taken the
liberty
of enrolling you

09:28.667 --> 09:29.959
in home economics instead.

09:30.041 --> 09:32.250
So I can change diapers
and make pudding cups

09:32.333 --> 09:33.375
for stiffs like you?

09:33.458 --> 09:36.125
- Sam!
- Why can't you leave me alone?

09:38.959 --> 09:40.500
Hey, new kid.

09:40.583 --> 09:42.792
- You get the dress yet?
- What dress?

09:42.875 --> 09:44.333
Oh, well, ever since homeroom

09:44.417 --> 09:47.208
everyone's saying you're the
shoo-in for homecoming queen.

09:47.291 --> 09:48.834
Sit and spin!

09:50.250 --> 09:52.917
Oh, you must be
real proud, pops.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.333
Dom Barron, what a surprise.

09:56.417 --> 09:57.417
Excuse me.

10:01.375 --> 10:04.333
No one was on her side.

10:04.417 --> 10:05.792
Not even me.

10:05.875 --> 10:08.917
This Dom Barron, he said
Sam should wear a dress?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.458
Oh, kids were always
cruel to her.

10:11.542 --> 10:14.417
He and Sam ever
get into it again?

10:14.500 --> 10:16.125
I don't know.

10:16.208 --> 10:18.250
She shut me out of her life.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.000
Guess I can't blame her.

10:23.583 --> 10:26.000
Thank you for your time,
Mr. Randall.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.250
I used to tell her

10:28.333 --> 10:31.333
'"It's a phase.'

10:31.417 --> 10:33.834
"When you're older
you'll look back..

10:33.917 --> 10:37.208
...and laugh at yourself
for acting this way."

10:40.333 --> 10:42.458
Guess I was wrong.

11:04.125 --> 11:06.375
You here to pick up
or place an order?

11:06.458 --> 11:08.333
Oh, neither.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.917
We wanna talk to you
about Sam Randall.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.583
(Dom)
Oh, that's a name
I haven't heard in a while.

11:16.709 --> 11:20.291
She died back
in '62, '63, right?

11:20.875 --> 11:22.667
November '63.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.375
We think someone killed her.

11:25.458 --> 11:26.959
My God.

11:27.041 --> 11:31.000
Found wearing a dress,
just like you said she should.

11:31.083 --> 11:34.333
I, uh, used to shoot
my mouth off all the
time.

11:34.417 --> 11:36.417
Thought I was a...a real badass

11:37.333 --> 11:39.500
but I was just a bored kid.

11:39.583 --> 11:42.417
Had quite a rap sheet
at the tender age of 16.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.583
Mm-hmm.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.834
Breaking and entering,
trespassing.

11:45.917 --> 11:47.000
Yeah, I skipped school, too.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.166
Wanna write that down?

11:51.667 --> 11:53.000
I didn't kill her.

11:53.083 --> 11:54.583
Where were you
the night she died?

11:54.667 --> 11:58.458
Home. Trying to keep dad
from beating mom unconscious.

11:58.542 --> 11:59.625
Real Norman Rockwell stuff.

11:59.709 --> 12:02.458
But she pissed you off,
didn't she? Sam?

12:02.542 --> 12:04.458
[chuckles]
Hell, yeah.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.291
She pissed everyone off.

12:06.375 --> 12:07.500
That's what I liked about her.

12:07.583 --> 12:10.959
Saying...you got familiar?

12:11.041 --> 12:12.625
(Scotty)
'It must've hurt
your reputation.'

12:12.709 --> 12:16.291
I didn't give a damn
what the other kids
thought.

12:16.375 --> 12:19.375
We both didn't...fit in.

12:19.458 --> 12:21.000
Made us cool.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.792
Oh, how did this
great friendship start?

12:23.875 --> 12:27.125
Bunch of guys used to
drag race out in the
Pines.

12:27.208 --> 12:30.917
Once Sam found out about it.
Nothing could keep her away.

12:42.583 --> 12:44.333
(Red)
'Let's go, boys.'

12:45.792 --> 12:47.125
Thought you'd chicken out.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.667
I wouldn't miss it
for the world, Red.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.834
This heap of rust
ain't gonna break 50.

12:54.917 --> 12:56.291
What are you
squawking about?

12:56.375 --> 12:58.500
I spent months
working on this
baby.

12:58.583 --> 13:00.500
How much fuel you got in there?

13:00.583 --> 13:01.917
About a quarter tank.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.834
That's too much. Pop it.

13:13.458 --> 13:14.542
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

13:14.625 --> 13:16.375
I don't let just
anyone touch my car.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.166
I know everything about engines.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.000
Trust me, will ya?

13:25.458 --> 13:27.250
Man, you must be desperate.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.709
So, Red, what are we racing for?

13:29.792 --> 13:31.875
How about pink slips?

13:31.959 --> 13:35.041
Nah, you can keep that jalopy.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.542
Let's bet her instead.

13:37.625 --> 13:39.542
(Dom)
'One date.'

13:39.625 --> 13:43.208
- It's a deal.
- My car for your girl.

13:43.291 --> 13:47.041
We're gonna leave your lead
sled in the dust, candy-ass.

13:47.125 --> 13:49.709
- Uh, "we?"
- Yeah.

13:49.792 --> 13:51.208
We're partners.

13:51.291 --> 13:52.250
Let's lay some rubber!

14:12.291 --> 14:14.667
(female #1)
'Ready?'

14:14.750 --> 14:15.625
Go!

14:31.750 --> 14:36.125
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Well..

14:36.208 --> 14:38.166
- What'd you put in the tank?
- Moonshine!

14:38.250 --> 14:40.625
[laughs]
Told you we'd win, didn't I?

14:40.709 --> 14:42.125
Full of all sorts
of surprises, ain't you?

14:42.208 --> 14:43.917
[chuckles
]
Yeah!

14:48.875 --> 14:49.959
You cheated, you freak.

14:50.041 --> 14:51.125
Ah, climb it, Tarzan.

14:51.208 --> 14:53.667
Hey, hey, we won fair
and square, Red.

14:53.750 --> 14:54.959
Lay off the kid.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.750
If you think you
can screw Red Buckley over

14:56.834 --> 14:58.959
you're crazier
than you look.

15:05.041 --> 15:06.417
Sam was fun.

15:06.500 --> 15:10.417
And she knew what it
was like to be an
outsider.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.750
Like you.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.583
Sam was my only friend.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.625
Think it went both ways.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.125
You never thought to tell the
cops about this after she
died?

15:20.208 --> 15:21.834
I didn't think it would matter.

15:21.917 --> 15:25.041
- They said she killed
herself.
- What about Red?

15:25.125 --> 15:27.083
He ever make good
on his threat?

15:27.166 --> 15:28.750
Must've.

15:28.834 --> 15:31.500
If she didn't
kill herself,
right?

15:33.250 --> 15:34.750
Thanks for your time.

15:36.667 --> 15:40.667
The town bully loses his pride
and his girl on the same night.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.125
Blames Sam for his woes.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.959
One would have to be
chicken to not get revenge.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.625
He giving Gordon hell?

16:01.709 --> 16:04.542
And the chief of detectives.

16:11.417 --> 16:13.500
Guess I should pack my bags.

16:13.583 --> 16:16.041
Looks like John's giving
as good as he gets.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.125
Red Buckley.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.583
I've been asking
around about you.

16:45.667 --> 16:47.041
If I knew cops were this cute

16:47.125 --> 16:49.000
I'd have come in
sooner,
saved you the trouble.

16:49.083 --> 16:51.667
You had quite the bad boy
reputation in high school.

16:52.834 --> 16:55.625
Ladies' man...into hot rods.

16:55.709 --> 16:58.166
Still got that
little Chevy in my
backyard

16:58.250 --> 16:59.917
if you'd like to take a spin.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.208
- Tempting.
- Ha ha ha.

17:02.291 --> 17:05.041
People are still talking
about those drag races

17:05.125 --> 17:06.375
out in the Pines.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.291
Undefeated, all
through high school, huh!

17:09.208 --> 17:12.417
- That car was a rocket.
- Mm.

17:13.625 --> 17:15.208
Actually, I heard different.

17:15.291 --> 17:17.583
This one legendary night..

17:17.667 --> 17:22.125
...when you got served
your ass on a plate...by a
girl.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.709
Who, Sam Randall?

17:25.041 --> 17:27.542
- That wasn't a girl.
- You bullied Sam.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.000
Hated her for showing you up.

17:29.083 --> 17:32.250
If she would
just put on a
skirt..

17:32.333 --> 17:33.875
...us guys would've let her be.

17:33.959 --> 17:35.625
Threatened by her,
weren't you, Red?

17:35.709 --> 17:37.458
Freaked out, more like.

17:37.542 --> 17:38.792
Everyone was, even the girls.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.208
Saying she got
into it with them?

17:40.291 --> 17:43.917
Well, you know
how you females can be, hmm..

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
...vicious.

17:56.959 --> 17:59.625
Serve it up, gals.
Red's a hungry man.

17:59.709 --> 18:01.959
Can't believe
you get credit for this.

18:02.041 --> 18:03.166
Red knows who
the winner is.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.125
He's tasted
my pie
before.

18:06.208 --> 18:07.709
Bet he has.

18:07.792 --> 18:10.542
<i>son.</i>
Did you say something?

18:11.583 --> 18:13.542
Don't flip your wig, slut.

18:14.458 --> 18:15.709
Nice apron.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.417
(female #1)
'Gotta try lipstick
sometime.'

18:17.500 --> 18:19.000
Oh, so I can look
like a ditz, too?

18:20.417 --> 18:22.333
At least I'm not a lesbo.

18:25.291 --> 18:26.375
How many hours
a day you spend

18:26.458 --> 18:29.667
caking it on,
stuffing your bra?

18:29.750 --> 18:32.125
- Just wondering.
- Huh.

18:32.208 --> 18:35.291
These are primo,
100 percent real.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.667
You should try it.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.333
Looking like a girl, I mean.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.375
Lot of work being a skirt.

18:40.458 --> 18:41.458
No, thanks.

18:41.542 --> 18:43.041
Look, butch..

18:43.125 --> 18:45.250
...I don't know how they
dressed at your last
school..

18:45.333 --> 18:51.208
...but at Grays Ferry,
girls look like this.

18:51.291 --> 18:53.000
- Might wanna take some notes.
- Mm-hmm.

18:55.417 --> 18:57.375
- 'Ha ha ha!'
- Hey!

18:59.458 --> 19:01.375
Looks like somewhere
there's a pony missing his
tail.

19:03.125 --> 19:05.250
I'll get you back, lesbo.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.000
You've messed
with the wrong
girl.

19:14.500 --> 19:17.208
Sounds like Janey had
a nasty little temper.

19:17.291 --> 19:20.208
Once, some chick winked
at me at the drive-in.

19:20.291 --> 19:22.375
Janey gave her a black eye.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.000
And Sam grabbed the tiara

19:24.083 --> 19:25.625
right off the beauty
queen's head so to speak.

19:25.709 --> 19:29.041
Trust me. You didn't
want to cross Janey
Davis.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.875
If you knew
what was good for
you.

19:30.959 --> 19:32.875
Where were you
the night Sam died?

19:32.959 --> 19:34.291
At the Homecoming Dance.

19:34.375 --> 19:38.125
Spent most of it behind
the gym trying to get some
off..

19:38.208 --> 19:39.500
...Melissa Lauer.

19:39.583 --> 19:42.083
- Oh!
- I'll track Melissa down.

19:42.166 --> 19:43.542
See what she says.

19:43.625 --> 19:46.250
Let me know if she's single.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.250
(Nick)
Sam Randall made
a fool out of you.

19:57.333 --> 20:00.083
- 'Exposed you as a fake.'
- And she was right.

20:00.166 --> 20:04.041
I was the belle of the ball
with
my bullet bra and war paint.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.875
Take it you're more
evolved than that now.

20:05.959 --> 20:07.125
Uh, I like to think so.

20:07.208 --> 20:09.875
What made you change,
Janey? Guilt, maybe?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.125
No, living through
the feminist
movement.

20:13.208 --> 20:14.834
It changed my life.

20:14.917 --> 20:16.625
Come a long way
since high
school.

20:16.709 --> 20:18.458
When you threatened Sam Randall?

20:18.542 --> 20:20.458
Look, I was a bitch
on wheels back then.

20:20.542 --> 20:23.125
I'm not proud of it.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.250
Sam frightened me.

20:24.333 --> 20:25.458
Oh, she did more
than frighten you

20:25.542 --> 20:27.291
she turned you
into a punch line.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.792
- So you got rid of her.
- I had a score to settle.

20:29.875 --> 20:33.542
But not with Sam.
With Sam's friend
Dom.

20:33.625 --> 20:36.500
He stood me up
for our stupid
date.

20:36.583 --> 20:37.959
What does this have to
do with Sam's murder?

20:38.041 --> 20:41.291
I went to find him,
give him a piece of my
mind.

20:41.375 --> 20:43.583
He and, uh, Sam
were at the
lake.

20:43.667 --> 20:45.625
- In FDR Park?
- Mm.

20:45.709 --> 20:47.166
Their regular hangout.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.834
That's when I found
out
what Sam really was.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.917
[sighs]
Damn, it's
hot.

21:02.333 --> 21:05.083
I thought you were taking
Janey
to see "Dr. No" tonight.

21:05.166 --> 21:06.208
(Dom)
'Nah, I blew it off.'

21:07.959 --> 21:10.000
Why?

21:10.083 --> 21:11.333
I was gonna
take her
parking

21:11.417 --> 21:15.250
but...still have to talk
to her on the ride home.

21:18.834 --> 21:20.542
(Dom)
'You know, a lot
of chicks are like that.'

21:20.625 --> 21:22.166
No offense.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.166
Ha ha.

21:30.083 --> 21:31.417
You live here your whole life?

21:35.250 --> 21:37.875
Only place in this
damn
town you can breathe.

21:37.959 --> 21:39.417
This spot.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.875
Nobody's judging you.

21:43.959 --> 21:45.500
Trying to make you
something you're not.

21:47.834 --> 21:49.291
Wish we could
stay here forever.

21:51.959 --> 21:54.709
Why don't you
act like them?

21:54.792 --> 21:57.834
Girls, I mean. I don't
care.
I'm just wondering.

22:02.291 --> 22:05.583
'Cause this is
just the way I am.

22:05.667 --> 22:11.375
I don't know what that makes me.
It just...feels right, you know?

22:11.458 --> 22:12.917
Yeah, I think so.

22:15.458 --> 22:20.000
I used to ask Santa for
matchbox cars every Christmas.

22:20.083 --> 22:23.083
He brought me a Barbie one
year and I bawled my eyes out.

22:27.583 --> 22:31.542
I'm not trying
to be anybody else.

22:31.625 --> 22:33.250
Just me.

22:34.667 --> 22:36.250
Well, we'll never
let them change us.

22:36.333 --> 22:37.583
Always be free.

22:37.667 --> 22:39.250
Or die trying.

22:39.333 --> 22:40.875
Deal?

22:40.959 --> 22:43.333
Deal.

22:47.792 --> 22:49.083
(Dom)
So, uh..

22:50.834 --> 22:53.250
...do you like chicks?

22:53.333 --> 22:56.375
- I mean, the way I do?
- No.

22:57.792 --> 23:00.250
Oh, so who do you like?

23:03.959 --> 23:05.083
Well..

23:07.041 --> 23:09.250
...I like you.

23:17.250 --> 23:18.625
- What the hell are you doing?
- I don't know!

23:18.709 --> 23:21.333
Uh, I'm not some queer!

23:21.417 --> 23:22.750
I just wanna be
with you, Dom, I'm sorry--

23:22.834 --> 23:24.625
Just shut up!

23:24.709 --> 23:26.458
You try that again..

23:26.542 --> 23:28.250
...and I'll beat your head in.

23:29.917 --> 23:30.875
Dom!

23:37.792 --> 23:41.166
- I know. It was confusing.
- You can say that again.

23:41.250 --> 23:45.625
And I made sure it got
around the next day at
school.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.375
Excuse me.

23:52.333 --> 23:54.166
So the gender-bending
girl makes a pass

23:54.250 --> 23:56.667
at the loner bad boy
and everyone knows.

23:56.750 --> 23:59.875
Maybe Dom wasn't such
a sensitive guy after all.

24:02.917 --> 24:04.458
She was a boy..

24:04.542 --> 24:07.500
...inside of a girl
who liked a boy?

24:07.583 --> 24:09.750
That about sums it up.

24:09.834 --> 24:11.375
Making my head hurt here.

24:11.458 --> 24:14.333
Yeah, that's probably why cops
dropped it like a hot potato.

24:14.417 --> 24:16.333
Well, still don't explain
the marks on her head.

24:16.417 --> 24:19.875
Or why she ended up in
girls'
clothes the night she
died.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.542
Mm. Dom's got a little
explaining to do.

24:22.625 --> 24:25.041
Will, you wanna
step in for a sec?

24:25.125 --> 24:26.375
Sure.

24:34.083 --> 24:36.000
I'm gonna need you
to keep an eye on things

24:36.083 --> 24:37.333
'around here
for a little while.'

24:37.417 --> 24:39.291
What do you mean?

24:39.375 --> 24:41.458
'Well, you're
the senior man on the squad.'

24:41.542 --> 24:44.041
(John)
They'll listen to
you.
Have a seat.

24:44.125 --> 24:45.542
What's going on, John?

24:46.959 --> 24:51.000
I'm gonna have to take
a 30-day rip, starting
Friday.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.250
'I can use the time.'

24:52.333 --> 24:54.041
I haven't been
fishing in six years.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.875
IAD? They're suspending you?

24:55.959 --> 24:58.333
I told them I signed off
on the shooting and Burrell.

24:58.417 --> 25:01.834
- 'Scotty's hands were
tied.'
- So you're taking the hit.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.542
Scotty's a good cop.

25:03.625 --> 25:05.625
Doesn't need some
stink on his rep.

25:05.709 --> 25:06.667
And you do?

25:08.458 --> 25:10.583
I'm set.
I've been around long enough.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.667
I don't need to worry about
who's comin' after me.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.291
I don't know what to say.

25:15.875 --> 25:17.000
Well..

25:17.083 --> 25:20.083
...say you'll keep
the trains running.

25:20.166 --> 25:23.291
- Just for 30 days?
- 'Well, who knows?'

25:23.375 --> 25:25.834
I might take a shine to it.

25:25.917 --> 25:27.583
Come on. You can't leave this.

25:27.667 --> 25:30.000
Yeah? What part?
The hours? The politics?

25:33.000 --> 25:35.250
Seriously, John,
what are you gonna do?

25:37.750 --> 25:39.250
I don't know.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.291
And maybe it's time I found out.

25:42.834 --> 25:45.667
To lazy afternoons fishing.

25:45.750 --> 25:47.333
To old friends.

25:48.875 --> 25:50.041
Amen to that.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.750
I heard Sam got fresh
with you at the lake.

26:01.834 --> 26:03.959
In '63, you get caught
in a clinch with a girl

26:04.041 --> 26:06.125
who's really a boy,
don't look too good.

26:06.208 --> 26:07.500
I didn't kiss her.

26:07.583 --> 26:09.000
Witness says it got
pretty hot and heavy.

26:09.083 --> 26:12.458
- I'm not...that way.
- What way?

26:12.542 --> 26:15.750
Sam looked...like a boy.

26:15.834 --> 26:17.792
You've seen pictures.

26:17.875 --> 26:19.542
It was, uh, confusing.

26:19.625 --> 26:21.083
I bet it was.

26:21.166 --> 26:22.792
Especially when
the whole school found out.

26:22.875 --> 26:26.000
About you and your buddy.

26:26.083 --> 26:28.750
Made you a little light
in your loafers by
association.

26:28.834 --> 26:30.667
And best way to
rehab your reputation

26:30.750 --> 26:32.125
was to get rid of the freak.

26:32.208 --> 26:34.625
<i>freak!</i>

26:34.709 --> 26:35.959
She..

26:38.375 --> 26:40.542
She was just lost.

26:40.625 --> 26:42.000
I should've
handled
it differently.

26:42.083 --> 26:45.500
- And not killed her--
- I didn't kill her.

26:45.583 --> 26:48.333
I-I, I shut her out.
I gave her the cold
shoulder.

26:48.417 --> 26:50.583
But you didn't give a damn
about
what the other kids thought.

26:50.667 --> 26:52.917
- Right?
- Wrong.

26:53.875 --> 26:56.041
I did.

26:56.125 --> 26:57.458
And I abandoned Sam

26:57.542 --> 26:59.250
when she needed me the most.

27:32.625 --> 27:35.041
Aw, looky here, she's cryin'.

27:35.125 --> 27:37.041
Boys don't cry.

27:37.125 --> 27:39.125
You a boy, huh?

27:39.208 --> 27:40.709
Or you just like kissing 'em?

27:43.625 --> 27:45.000
So you a queer now, too?

27:45.083 --> 27:47.333
Gotta make up your mind
what you are, freak.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.917
You wanna get with boys,
you gotta look like a girl.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.458
Go of me, you dumb ugly lug.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.417
- Ha ha ha.
- 'Queer!'

28:00.250 --> 28:03.208
(male #2)
'Come on. Get it.
Get it out. Get it out,
Red.'

28:03.291 --> 28:05.792
'Hold her still. Show her'

28:07.208 --> 28:10.583
You want to be a girl, huh?
I'll show you what a girl is.

28:10.667 --> 28:12.250
- 'No! No!'
- Hold her still!

28:12.333 --> 28:14.083
(male #3)
'Hold her still, Jay.'

28:15.959 --> 28:17.583
(male #1)
'Samantha Randall.'

28:20.500 --> 28:22.250
<i>now!</i>

28:30.166 --> 28:34.417
Sam had more guts and integrity
than anyone in that school.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.792
Including me.

28:36.875 --> 28:38.625
What did the principal do?

28:38.709 --> 28:40.208
Called her father.

28:40.291 --> 28:41.959
Yanked her out
of school, I
guess.

28:42.041 --> 28:43.375
Sam was expelled?

28:44.959 --> 28:47.291
Her dad came
to pick her up that
day.

28:49.125 --> 28:51.166
I never saw her again.

28:51.250 --> 28:52.709
(Kat)
'Archie lied to us.'

28:52.792 --> 28:54.792
Had to pull up stakes again.

28:54.875 --> 28:58.291
Maybe he didn't have
any more moves left in him.

28:58.375 --> 29:00.291
(Nick)
'Never told us Sam got
kicked out of Grays Ferry.'

29:00.375 --> 29:03.125
What was that, third
high school in three years?

29:03.208 --> 29:04.917
Not sure what
you're getting at here.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.792
Your daughter
thought she was a boy

29:06.875 --> 29:08.834
and had a nasty temper to boot.

29:08.917 --> 29:10.542
I loved Sam.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.834
I only wanted
what was best for her.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.834
Couldn't move again
though, could you?

29:14.917 --> 29:16.500
You were at
your wits' end.

29:16.583 --> 29:18.166
I-I didn't know
what else to do.

29:18.250 --> 29:19.834
So you lost your temper.

29:22.083 --> 29:24.291
(Will)
'Maybe things got out of
hand.'

29:24.375 --> 29:25.625
You hit her, Archie?

29:26.917 --> 29:28.166
Oh, no.

29:29.250 --> 29:31.166
I did something much worse.

29:33.542 --> 29:36.500
Her diagnosis is
gender identity disorder.

29:36.583 --> 29:39.500
At Brook View,
we teach girls like Samantha

29:39.583 --> 29:42.542
to dress, talk,
and walk like ladies.

29:42.625 --> 29:44.041
How? What will you do to her?

29:44.125 --> 29:46.834
Behavior modification,
medication.

29:46.917 --> 29:49.875
Worst case scenario,
electroconvulsive therapy.

29:49.959 --> 29:51.417
I don't know about that.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.667
You do want what's best
for your daughter, don't you?

29:53.750 --> 29:55.166
Of course I do.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.625
It's just that, uh

29:56.709 --> 29:59.041
Sam's never
been away from home before.

29:59.125 --> 30:00.542
We can help her.

30:00.625 --> 30:02.333
Why, just last month,
a former patient

30:02.417 --> 30:03.583
got engaged to be married.

30:03.667 --> 30:05.041
Get me outta here.

30:05.125 --> 30:06.709
(Archie)
Don't make this harder
than it already is, Sam.

30:06.792 --> 30:08.709
I'll be good. I'll change.
I'll wear whatever you want.

30:08.792 --> 30:11.250
She won't need these
boys' clothing anymore.

30:11.333 --> 30:12.375
Samantha will be wearing a dress

30:12.458 --> 30:14.208
like a normal girl
when we're done.

30:14.291 --> 30:15.959
[sobbing]
Daddy, please. Dad,
please
don't make me stay here.

30:16.041 --> 30:18.041
I am sorry, Samantha.
I love you.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.375
<i>please!'</i>
- But it's-it's the only
way.

30:20.458 --> 30:23.041
[shouting]
No, daddy, I'll be
good.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.875
(Sam)
<i>please!'</i>

30:26.291 --> 30:27.917
<i>please!</i>

30:29.875 --> 30:33.875
(Sam)
'No! I'll be good.'

30:33.959 --> 30:36.250
'Please, dad, I promise!'

30:41.417 --> 30:43.959
She was calling for me..

30:45.625 --> 30:47.583
...and I just walked away.

30:49.625 --> 30:52.166
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

30:52.250 --> 30:55.083
How long was she
at that hospital?

30:55.166 --> 30:58.125
Um, two weeks.

30:58.208 --> 30:59.917
Then she ran away.

31:01.750 --> 31:03.333
That's what they told me.

31:03.417 --> 31:04.917
Same night she died?

31:06.750 --> 31:08.625
Maybe.

31:08.709 --> 31:13.166
Maybe if she wasn't scared I'd
bring her back to that place.

31:14.875 --> 31:16.667
Maybe she-she
would've come home.

31:19.792 --> 31:21.917
Thanks for your time,
Mr. Randall.

31:23.667 --> 31:25.625
Hospital's probably
where
she got the red dress.

31:25.709 --> 31:26.959
Electroconvulsive therapy.

31:27.041 --> 31:28.458
Explains the burn marks
on her temples.

31:28.542 --> 31:29.709
Hospital goes too far

31:29.792 --> 31:30.959
ends up with a dead
teenager on their
hands.

31:31.041 --> 31:33.250
And someone at Brook View
covered it up.

31:46.709 --> 31:49.125
- You got something?
- Been looking into Brook
View.

31:49.208 --> 31:52.375
The nuthouse where
Sam Randall was admitted.

31:52.458 --> 31:56.834
Shut down in '72 after three
teenagers went through ECT.

31:56.917 --> 31:59.333
- Got deep-fried.
- Electroconvulsive therapy?

31:59.417 --> 32:01.041
And it was still
experimental back then.

32:01.125 --> 32:03.583
Current too high,
patients came out brain-dead.

32:03.667 --> 32:04.750
(John)
Who was her doctor?

32:04.834 --> 32:06.333
(Scotty)
A Russell Kearns.

32:06.417 --> 32:09.041
- Died of cancer in '85.
- Oh, great.

32:09.125 --> 32:10.667
We got any other leads?

32:10.750 --> 32:13.291
Polly Leonard,
a nurse at Sam's school.

32:13.375 --> 32:14.834
Also worked the night shift

32:14.917 --> 32:17.667
on the Gender Disorder
ward at Brook View.

32:17.750 --> 32:19.792
Quit right around
the time Sam died.

32:19.875 --> 32:21.375
- We bringing her in?
- Already did.

32:21.458 --> 32:23.375
(John)
'Alright. Good work.'

32:33.125 --> 32:37.333
Jeffries said
you're taking my suspension.

32:37.417 --> 32:39.333
Wasn't yours to take, Scotty.

32:39.417 --> 32:42.291
- Well, it ain't right.
- Water under the bridge.

32:42.375 --> 32:44.083
It's done.

32:44.166 --> 32:46.542
Well, thanks for..

32:46.625 --> 32:48.166
...looking out.

32:48.250 --> 32:50.041
Nurse Leonard is waiting.

32:52.417 --> 32:53.667
Right.

32:56.583 --> 32:57.917
You coming, boss?

33:07.625 --> 33:10.375
As I said, I barely
remember that girl.

33:10.458 --> 33:13.208
You were zapping so many
patients at Brook View

33:13.291 --> 33:15.083
it's hard to keep
them all straight.

33:15.166 --> 33:17.709
We know about the other zombies
the hospital churned out.

33:17.792 --> 33:20.875
Three to be exact.
All under your care.

33:23.750 --> 33:26.417
It was horrible what they
were
doing to those young
people.

33:26.500 --> 33:28.500
- Terrible.
- You just let it happen.

33:28.583 --> 33:31.583
Doctors don't listen to nurses.

33:31.667 --> 33:34.709
- It was out of my hands.
- Then why'd you quit?

33:34.792 --> 33:36.917
After Sam died,
you just ran for the hills.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.417
I didn't run for any damn hills.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.583
My whole life I've
been holding my tongue

33:41.667 --> 33:43.792
watching men make mistakes.

33:43.875 --> 33:46.792
But I begged Dr. Kearns to stop.

33:46.875 --> 33:50.166
But doctors don't
listen to nurses.

33:50.250 --> 33:53.750
I truly thought that we were
helping in the beginning.

33:53.834 --> 33:57.000
But Sam had so much
fight in her.

33:57.083 --> 34:00.250
They did everything
they could to snuff it out.

34:05.834 --> 34:09.542
And one more time.
Pull out your chair.

34:11.875 --> 34:16.333
Lower yourself slowly
into the seat. Don't plop.

34:19.041 --> 34:20.792
Excellent progress, Samantha.

34:23.417 --> 34:27.333
(Dr. Kearns over PA)
'Don't scrape
the chair, Felicia.'

34:27.417 --> 34:30.250
And hands in your laps.

34:30.333 --> 34:33.500
(Polly)
'Lovely. Louise!'

34:33.583 --> 34:35.542
Louise, do you want Dr. Kearns

34:35.625 --> 34:38.125
to send you back
to the ECT room?

34:41.417 --> 34:45.458
[sighs]
And now, let's
move on to grooming.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.083
Today is lipstick.

34:59.875 --> 35:01.834
(Polly)
'Remove the cap.'

35:05.333 --> 35:06.917
'Place the lid
on the table.'

35:08.417 --> 35:11.208
'Hold the compact mirror
open in your left palm.'

35:15.250 --> 35:17.917
'Now start at the center
of the upper lip.'

35:18.000 --> 35:20.250
And move down to the right.

35:24.750 --> 35:25.917
No.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.208
(Dr. Kearns over PA)
'You must participate'

35:27.291 --> 35:28.500
'if you're going to get better.'

35:28.583 --> 35:31.792
But I can't get better
<i>sick!</i>

35:34.125 --> 35:35.709
You know this isn't right.

35:35.792 --> 35:38.625
You have no idea what these
people are capable of, Sam.

35:41.250 --> 35:43.834
Just do it.

35:43.917 --> 35:46.875
'Put on the lipstick now!'

35:46.959 --> 35:49.125
You put on the lipstick, buster!

35:49.208 --> 35:51.792
And while you're at
it,
sit and spin!

35:51.875 --> 35:55.250
I'm not crazy!
This is crazy, not
us!

35:55.333 --> 35:57.083
'You will behave
like a young lady!'

35:57.166 --> 36:00.041
You can call me a lady
or a freak or a delinquent.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.709
I don't care!

36:01.792 --> 36:05.709
[sobbing]
No! There's nothing
wrong with me!

36:05.792 --> 36:07.709
[Sam sobbing]
No!

36:07.792 --> 36:10.208
(Sam)
'No!'

36:10.291 --> 36:11.542
'No!'

36:13.750 --> 36:16.333
Sam was right.

36:16.417 --> 36:18.375
There was nothing
wrong with her.

36:18.458 --> 36:22.542
I just couldn't stand
watching them destroy
her.

36:22.625 --> 36:24.667
So I quit.

36:24.750 --> 36:27.625
Left her there to rot, too.
It's real noble of you.

36:27.709 --> 36:30.583
Oh, I found a friend
of hers from school.

36:30.667 --> 36:31.959
And I let him know
what happened.

36:32.041 --> 36:35.709
Her friend?
You mean Dom Barron?

36:35.792 --> 36:38.000
He was the only one
who talked to her.

36:38.083 --> 36:40.750
He seemed to be the type
who would do the right
thing

36:40.834 --> 36:43.709
even if he had to do
something against the
rules.

36:43.792 --> 36:46.625
You told him to save her.

36:46.709 --> 36:50.417
It was my first
and last act of rebellion.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.625
How did he get past
the hospital gate?

36:56.709 --> 36:58.375
I gave him the key.

37:15.208 --> 37:16.917
Beautiful work.

37:19.458 --> 37:22.291
You're not here to talk
about stained glass, are
you?

37:22.375 --> 37:23.917
It's the same image..

37:24.000 --> 37:27.083
'...over and
over in...every piece.'

37:27.166 --> 37:30.125
(Lilly)
'That...one figure.'

37:31.041 --> 37:32.625
Alone against the world.

37:34.959 --> 37:36.250
Kind of like Sam.

37:36.333 --> 37:38.792
I already told you.
We were...just
friends.

37:38.875 --> 37:40.792
Oh, it's hard to believe.

37:40.875 --> 37:42.333
Seeing this.

37:42.417 --> 37:44.166
(Kat)
'Hypothetically speaking..'

37:44.250 --> 37:46.000
...if you love a girl

37:46.083 --> 37:48.000
who's actually a boy inside

37:49.250 --> 37:50.208
what does that make you?

37:50.291 --> 37:52.917
I...didn't, uh..

37:54.417 --> 37:55.333
...love Sam.

37:55.417 --> 37:57.417
Then why'd you save her?

37:57.500 --> 37:59.166
Boy, girl..

37:59.250 --> 38:00.583
'...they're just words, right?'

38:02.083 --> 38:05.542
Define what's on the outside.
Not what's in here.

38:05.625 --> 38:06.792
Why are you doing this?

38:06.875 --> 38:09.250
You made a deal,
at the lake

38:09.333 --> 38:12.083
to never let 'em change you.

38:12.166 --> 38:14.583
Die trying.

38:14.667 --> 38:17.000
(Kat)
'That's why you
bought her back there.'

38:17.083 --> 38:20.542
The one place...
she could be free.

38:20.625 --> 38:21.875
She was.

38:23.750 --> 38:25.000
Free.

38:26.625 --> 38:29.583
In the end.

38:29.667 --> 38:32.250
I made sure of that.

38:32.333 --> 38:35.959
You couldn't put
a name on what you had.

38:36.041 --> 38:37.709
- But it still mattered.
- Ah!

38:39.583 --> 38:42.125
It was the only
thing
that mattered.

38:43.917 --> 38:46.041
That's why I went to her.

38:51.959 --> 38:53.291
Come on, Sam.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.792
Let's go. I'm getting you
out of here. Let's go!

38:57.375 --> 38:58.625
Sam?

39:07.125 --> 39:08.375
Sam?

39:33.000 --> 39:34.750
Hey.

39:34.834 --> 39:36.291
Hey.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.500
Sam.

39:38.583 --> 39:40.625
Come back. Come back.

39:40.709 --> 39:42.500
Come back.

39:42.583 --> 39:44.959
Please, Sam.

39:45.041 --> 39:46.875
Please come back.

39:48.166 --> 39:50.458
I-I blew it,
I-I know I let you
down

39:50.542 --> 39:54.875
but you gotta come back 'cause
we made a deal. We had a deal.

39:55.625 --> 39:57.125
Remember?

39:57.208 --> 39:58.417
At the lake?

39:58.500 --> 40:00.208
To never let them change us.

40:00.291 --> 40:01.542
To always be free.

40:01.625 --> 40:02.834
Or die trying.

40:02.917 --> 40:04.834
Huh? You remember?

40:09.875 --> 40:12.333
Make me free.

40:14.875 --> 40:18.083
I-I can't.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.583
I won't.

40:21.667 --> 40:23.458
I won't do that, Sam, I..

40:23.542 --> 40:24.792
I won't, no way.

40:24.875 --> 40:25.917
No way!

40:29.166 --> 40:30.750
I-I know you're in there, Sam.

40:30.834 --> 40:32.834
I-I know it's you!

40:32.917 --> 40:34.417
Come on. I won't do that.
You hear me?

40:34.500 --> 40:36.208
I won't.

40:36.291 --> 40:38.542
I won't.

40:39.333 --> 40:41.041
Don't I look pretty?

40:57.083 --> 40:58.834
Now you do.

43:56.208 --> 43:57.500
