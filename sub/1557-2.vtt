WEBVTT

00:02.458 --> 00:03.819
Okay. We're almost ready here.

00:03.820 --> 00:05.527
Okay. Now, easy on the filters, Cam.

00:05.528 --> 00:07.441
It's a family picture.
We don't need sepia tone.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.039
You know what
other tone we don't need?

00:09.040 --> 00:09.961
Play nice.

00:10.290 --> 00:10.973
Okay.

00:10.974 --> 00:13.470
We are taking a new photo
for above our mantel.

00:13.471 --> 00:14.938
Lily's not in the one
up there now,

00:14.939 --> 00:18.476
and we... started to get
the slight impression that...

00:18.477 --> 00:19.983
it was bothering her.

00:20.557 --> 00:23.311
Lily, we're ready for dinner, sw--
Oh.

00:27.441 --> 00:29.165
Big smiles!

00:30.432 --> 00:31.476
- Great.
- Great.

00:31.477 --> 00:33.185
Let's take a look.

00:35.018 --> 00:36.591
Okay.
Not bad.

00:36.900 --> 00:37.999
Not bad.

00:39.169 --> 00:41.134
- Let's shake out our faces.
- Really?

00:41.135 --> 00:43.500
Who took the online course?
Shake 'em out.

00:44.650 --> 00:46.111
Yep. That's perfect.

00:46.196 --> 00:49.010
1... 2...

00:49.084 --> 00:51.034
- Chee-e-e-se!
- Chee-e-e-se!

00:51.035 --> 00:53.097
Okay. Great!

00:55.060 --> 00:56.166
Okay, um, Mitchell,

00:56.167 --> 00:57.917
- can I see you over here, please?
- Yeah.

00:57.918 --> 00:59.168
Hang tight, sweetie.

00:59.417 --> 01:00.356
Look.

01:01.203 --> 01:02.405
Why is she doing
that with her face?

01:02.406 --> 01:03.927
I don't know.
I've never seen

01:03.928 --> 01:05.449
such a weird, forced smile.

01:05.450 --> 01:06.373
How do I look?

01:06.374 --> 01:08.146
- Beautiful.
- Perfect.

01:22.348 --> 01:23.868
Wow! What an amazing campus!

01:25.069 --> 01:26.627
I mean, look at these cool buildings.

01:26.629 --> 01:28.482
And did you guys see the turtles?

01:28.483 --> 01:30.220
And check this out --

01:30.221 --> 01:31.568
a reflecting pond.

01:31.569 --> 01:33.543
Great. Maybe you can see
how crazy you're being right now.

01:33.544 --> 01:35.638
God, I wish I'd brought a frisbee.

01:35.829 --> 01:36.771
What's so special?

01:36.772 --> 01:38.823
It looks exactly
like the college I went to.

01:38.824 --> 01:39.833
And we've been here

01:39.834 --> 01:41.474
exactly as long
as you were there.

01:41.475 --> 01:42.533
Luke, be nice.

01:42.534 --> 01:43.723
Well, Alex is leaving.

01:43.724 --> 01:45.303
Somebody's got to keep
the trains running.

01:45.304 --> 01:46.776
Back me up here, guys.

01:46.777 --> 01:48.988
This place screams "Alex," right?

01:48.989 --> 01:51.156
It looks like every other
college in America.

01:51.157 --> 01:52.663
What am I missing?

01:52.685 --> 01:56.244
Good grades, S.A.T. scores,
basic verbal skills.

01:56.245 --> 01:57.416
That's how you do it.

01:58.383 --> 02:00.285
CalTech is the perfect school.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.143
For Claire.

02:01.144 --> 02:02.962
And Alex! Come on,
we are talking about

02:02.963 --> 02:04.846
one of the best schools
in the country.

02:04.847 --> 02:07.003
And, yes, it happens to be
45 minutes from our house.

02:07.004 --> 02:09.055
Of course, we'll support her
wherever she goes.

02:09.055 --> 02:11.856
Obviously.
Nothing is more important to me

02:11.858 --> 02:13.179
than her academic whatever,

02:13.180 --> 02:14.195
but with Alex,

02:14.196 --> 02:15.936
the important thing
is keeping her close

02:15.937 --> 02:17.439
for the next four years.

02:17.440 --> 02:19.397
After that,
I'm never gonna see her

02:19.398 --> 02:22.331
unless she Skypes
me from Neptune,

02:22.332 --> 02:24.446
where she's living
in a biodome she invented.

02:24.447 --> 02:27.432
Awesome! That means
Christmas on Neptune!

02:29.247 --> 02:30.345
Every other year?

02:30.564 --> 02:31.722
No, no.

02:31.723 --> 02:33.689
All right, everyone,
gather 'round.

02:33.690 --> 02:35.566
We'll be starting the tour
in just a moment.

02:35.567 --> 02:38.041
Okay. I'm gonna peel off
and hit the robotics lab

02:38.042 --> 02:39.815
to see how close they are
to a working female.

02:39.816 --> 02:41.209
Hold on.

02:41.644 --> 02:43.106
They're not nearly
as close as you'd hope,

02:43.107 --> 02:44.829
and you're not leaving my side.

02:44.830 --> 02:46.049
But it's so boring.

02:46.050 --> 02:47.275
It's like I'm being punished.

02:47.276 --> 02:48.158
You are being punished.

02:48.159 --> 02:49.498
That's what happens
when your teacher calls

02:49.499 --> 02:50.934
to tell me you cut class.

02:50.935 --> 02:53.598
I'm sorry. I lost track
of time making my movie.

02:53.599 --> 02:54.931
Hummingbirdman --

02:54.932 --> 02:58.472
a superhero whose heart can beat
a thousand times a minute.

02:58.993 --> 03:00.451
But can it love?

03:00.850 --> 03:02.658
Check it --
there's a lab on campus

03:02.659 --> 03:04.572
where they do experiments
on you for 50 bucks.

03:04.573 --> 03:07.444
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I used to do
a lot of these in college.

03:07.445 --> 03:08.372
Sometimes it's questions.

03:08.373 --> 03:10.205
Sometimes they hook
stuff up to you.

03:10.206 --> 03:12.184
Sometimes it's just palling
around with a monkey,

03:12.185 --> 03:14.276
wondering why they're
rewarding him and not you.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.369
Well, that sounds great.
You should go do that.

03:16.370 --> 03:17.324
I'll go.

03:17.325 --> 03:19.077
I'm up for it as long as
they don't shave anything.

03:19.078 --> 03:20.603
Hey, I'd love the 50 bucks,

03:20.604 --> 03:22.428
but I'm pretty sure
mom wants me here.

03:22.429 --> 03:23.753
No, I don't. You can go.

03:23.754 --> 03:25.385
Oh, you can drop the act.

03:25.386 --> 03:27.043
I know you guys
forced me to come here

03:27.044 --> 03:28.140
so I can watch Alex

03:28.141 --> 03:30.228
and get all inspired
by college again.

03:30.229 --> 03:31.005
We really didn't.

03:31.006 --> 03:32.523
Yeah, you just got in the car.

03:32.524 --> 03:34.328
I only packed four sandwiches.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.119
Happy anniversary, Jay!

03:42.875 --> 03:44.668
I don't love this tableau.

03:45.328 --> 03:47.201
Is that Gloria's gift to me?

03:47.435 --> 03:47.973
What is it?

03:47.974 --> 03:48.624
I don't know.

03:48.625 --> 03:50.564
Sure you do.
I can tell by the wrap job.

03:50.565 --> 03:52.524
She can't make
corners like this, Manny!

03:52.525 --> 03:54.654
Only because she's
always in such a hurry.

03:54.655 --> 03:56.611
Is life so busy
you can't take 20 minutes

03:56.612 --> 03:59.012
to get out the straight-edge
and wrap a gift anymore?

03:59.013 --> 04:01.192
Come on. I'm a little anxious
about my gift for her.

04:01.193 --> 04:02.623
It would make me
feel a lot better

04:02.624 --> 04:04.388
if I knew she phoned
this one in.

04:04.389 --> 04:06.490
Sorry, Jay.
Only time will tell.

04:06.491 --> 04:07.196
Oh, God.

04:07.197 --> 04:09.951
It's that black Panerai watch
I wanted, isn't it?!

04:09.952 --> 04:12.549
Why can't you be this fast when
I'm your charades partner?

04:14.706 --> 04:16.130
Hola, my loves!

04:16.132 --> 04:18.237
You didn't see me.
Keep her out of the garage.

04:20.678 --> 04:21.349
What are we gonna do?

04:21.350 --> 04:22.591
I'm gonna talk to her.

04:22.592 --> 04:24.460
I've been photographing
her for years.

04:24.461 --> 04:25.648
We have a relationship.

04:25.649 --> 04:26.797
Really? What's she like?

04:26.798 --> 04:28.412
I mean a professional relationship.

04:28.413 --> 04:29.520
Look, I'm gonna tell her --

04:29.521 --> 04:32.082
her smile is forced,
it's unnatural,

04:32.083 --> 04:34.237
and we're not going home
until we get what we need.

04:34.238 --> 04:34.958
Couple of things --

04:34.959 --> 04:36.878
we are home,
and that's mean.

04:36.879 --> 04:37.999
What's your suggestion?

04:38.000 --> 04:39.147
We show her the photos

04:39.148 --> 04:41.628
and let her discover
her weird smile on her own.

04:41.629 --> 04:42.739
Okay. That's good.

04:43.760 --> 04:44.998
I video our football games

04:44.999 --> 04:46.583
so I can see what
we're doing wrong.

04:46.584 --> 04:47.287
That's how I figured out

04:47.288 --> 04:49.441
that powder-blue windbreaker
washed me out so much.

04:49.442 --> 04:51.671
Oh, thank God.
I'm sure the team appreciated that.

04:51.672 --> 04:54.158
- Lily, sweetheart, will you
come here for a second? - Yep.

04:54.159 --> 04:56.048
Let's do this gently, okay?

04:56.048 --> 04:57.205
Hi, sweetheart.

04:57.206 --> 04:59.284
Okay. So, daddy and I thought

04:59.285 --> 05:01.024
that we would look
at these photos together,

05:01.025 --> 05:02.640
the pictures that
we've taken so far,

05:02.641 --> 05:05.512
and see if there's anything
that we would do differently.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.367
Like, okay,
when I look at this photo,

05:07.368 --> 05:09.686
I think, "I could
stand up straighter."

05:09.687 --> 05:10.696
- Yeah.
- Cam?

05:10.697 --> 05:12.473
Okay. I think I could be

05:12.474 --> 05:14.249
a little less "Ryan Gosling"

05:14.250 --> 05:15.765
and a little more "every man."

05:17.668 --> 05:19.886
Lily, is there anything
that you see in yourself

05:19.887 --> 05:21.578
that you would want
to change here?

05:21.579 --> 05:23.764
Well, maybe we should
just do one more?

05:24.444 --> 05:25.851
Really? Okay.

05:25.852 --> 05:28.621
This might need a little powder.

05:31.270 --> 05:32.821
- Uh, Jay?
- Hey!

05:32.822 --> 05:33.772
Your wife's upstairs.

05:33.773 --> 05:35.153
You don't have to hide
in the garage anymore.

05:35.154 --> 05:36.280
I'm not hiding.

05:36.305 --> 05:37.670
Close the door, will you?

05:38.718 --> 05:39.902
How bad is the gift
you bought her?

05:39.903 --> 05:41.328
I didn't buy her anything.

05:41.329 --> 05:42.057
Bad idea.

05:42.058 --> 05:43.287
I once gave her
a bag full of hugs,

05:43.288 --> 05:45.083
and she definitely prefers stuff.

05:45.084 --> 05:46.048
It's not hugs.

05:46.049 --> 05:47.375
Does that sound like me?

05:48.114 --> 05:49.779
I made her something
in my pottery class.

05:49.780 --> 05:51.494
I can't believe you took
a pottery class.

05:51.495 --> 05:53.921
You're not the only one
around here with an artsy side.

05:53.922 --> 05:55.743
Yeah, I could've bought her
another piece of jewelry,

05:55.744 --> 05:58.431
but I thought, you know,
she might like this a little more,

05:58.432 --> 06:00.272
coming from the heart and all.

06:00.738 --> 06:02.528
Well, show it to me.
What is it?

06:10.271 --> 06:10.926
What is it?

06:10.927 --> 06:11.901
It's a bunny.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.696
It used to be my nickname for her.

06:13.697 --> 06:15.151
On our first date,
she had a cold,

06:15.152 --> 06:16.672
and she was sniffling a lot,

06:16.673 --> 06:18.257
and her nose would
wrinkle up real cute --

06:18.258 --> 06:19.175
you know, like a bunny.

06:20.210 --> 06:21.058
That's so sweet.

06:21.060 --> 06:23.286
Yeah, but that watch
is big and gorgeous

06:23.287 --> 06:24.610
and costs big bucks.

06:24.611 --> 06:27.517
I can't give her something handmade.
I mean, she --

06:27.623 --> 06:29.323
She's not sensitive like you and me.

06:29.324 --> 06:30.560
Listen to me.

06:30.755 --> 06:33.512
I think you went to the
jewelry store inside here,

06:33.678 --> 06:34.743
and you brought back a gem.

06:34.744 --> 06:35.935
Knock it off.

06:36.672 --> 06:37.474
You think so?

06:37.475 --> 06:38.670
She's gonna love it.
It's perfect.

06:38.671 --> 06:39.634
Perfect? Nah.

06:39.635 --> 06:42.386
But teacher Pablo did say
it shows great promise.

06:42.387 --> 06:43.964
And I am proud of the tail.

06:43.965 --> 06:44.934
Look at that.

06:45.042 --> 06:46.468
No, no, I said look.

06:46.469 --> 06:47.466
Sorry.

06:47.993 --> 06:51.689
And this building is home
to one of our five Nobel laureates

06:51.690 --> 06:53.459
currently teaching here.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.324
It also houses our high-current,

06:56.325 --> 06:58.817
high-stability particle accelerator.

06:59.904 --> 07:01.656
Okay. You need to calm down.

07:01.657 --> 07:02.364
This is a college tour,

07:02.365 --> 07:04.015
not Oprah's favorite things.

07:04.016 --> 07:07.241
I am just so impressed
by this place. Aren't you?

07:07.242 --> 07:07.812
Of course I am.

07:07.813 --> 07:10.525
It's one of the most prestigious
tech schools in the country.

07:10.587 --> 07:11.682
But if you must know,

07:11.683 --> 07:13.592
I don't love everything about it.

07:14.021 --> 07:16.145
What?
Oh, the mascot's a beaver.

07:16.146 --> 07:17.414
Don't worry.
Those jokes will get old.

07:17.415 --> 07:19.408
No, they won't, because
I'm not coming here.

07:19.409 --> 07:21.397
Honestly, the only reason
I took this tour today

07:21.398 --> 07:23.129
is so you won't accuse me of

07:23.130 --> 07:24.140
not giving it a fair shot.

07:25.257 --> 07:27.294
Why wouldn't you
want to go here?

07:27.675 --> 07:29.109
I can't believe
you're making me say this...

07:29.110 --> 07:30.777
It's too close to home.

07:30.778 --> 07:33.130
I have to get away from you guys
for a little bit, okay?

07:35.900 --> 07:38.027
All right. We're gonna
check out the dorms.

07:38.028 --> 07:40.479
Parents, say goodbye
to your children.

07:41.558 --> 07:42.110
Okay.

07:42.111 --> 07:43.041
I should go.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.418
Mom, wait!

07:48.419 --> 07:49.259
Honey, it's okay.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.275
We all say things that
we don't mean sometimes.

07:51.276 --> 07:53.143
Low blood sugar.
I need my sandwich.

07:53.434 --> 07:54.373
Yeah.

07:54.673 --> 07:55.571
Yeah.

08:02.768 --> 08:04.295
All right.
You can please wait here,

08:04.296 --> 08:05.869
and the experiment
will begin shortly.

08:05.870 --> 08:08.055
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:13.381 --> 08:15.081
What do you guys
think this is gonna be?

08:15.091 --> 08:16.429
I bet they'll show us
those ink blots

08:16.430 --> 08:18.569
that always look
like two girls kissing.

08:18.570 --> 08:19.634
A little tip from an old pro --

08:19.635 --> 08:21.819
they can electrify cheese, so...

08:22.397 --> 08:23.533
Hey, look at that.

08:23.534 --> 08:25.210
"Do not push."

08:25.626 --> 08:26.398
What are you doing?

08:26.399 --> 08:28.154
Teaching this button
a little something about free will.

08:28.155 --> 08:29.971
Luke, it says, "do not push."

08:29.972 --> 08:31.849
Which just makes me
want to push it more.

08:31.954 --> 08:32.965
Haley, back me up.

08:32.966 --> 08:34.532
Push it, don't push it.
I don't care.

08:34.533 --> 08:36.773
Is this mirror weird?
I look fuzzy.

08:38.124 --> 08:38.820
Who puts up a button

08:38.821 --> 08:40.554
with a sign that says
you can't push it?

08:40.556 --> 08:42.812
The same people
who stack the deck

08:42.815 --> 08:45.547
so the monkey always wins...

08:45.687 --> 08:46.803
Scientists!

08:46.805 --> 08:47.763
What are you talking about?

08:48.780 --> 08:50.182
We're not waiting
for the experiment.

08:50.183 --> 08:51.165
This is the experiment!

08:51.166 --> 08:52.895
They're watching us right now!

08:52.896 --> 08:54.188
Wait. What?

08:56.168 --> 08:57.364
And...

08:58.628 --> 09:00.746
- Okay. Good.
- All right. Let's take a look.

09:01.772 --> 09:03.953
Oh! Beautiful.

09:03.954 --> 09:05.512
Okay. She looks
like Pepper's pomeranian.

09:05.513 --> 09:06.714
We have to say something.

09:06.715 --> 09:09.593
What's going on?
Why are we still doing this?

09:09.594 --> 09:14.158
Honey, daddy and I
think you are a beautiful girl

09:14.159 --> 09:15.501
with a beautiful smile.

09:15.502 --> 09:16.287
Thank you.

09:16.288 --> 09:16.973
You're welcome.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.593
And I'm seeing that here, okay?

09:19.594 --> 09:22.021
But I'm just not seeing it here.

09:22.022 --> 09:23.488
What do you mean?

09:23.489 --> 09:25.724
Uh, well, uh...

09:26.220 --> 09:28.438
Lily, you're doing
a different smile today.

09:28.439 --> 09:29.465
Different how?

09:29.466 --> 09:32.919
It's just a little... stiff.

09:32.920 --> 09:33.786
Is it ugly?

09:33.787 --> 09:35.442
It's not ugly. No.

09:35.443 --> 09:37.141
It's, uh -- it, um...

09:37.480 --> 09:38.565
Cam...

09:39.512 --> 09:41.472
Uh, well, s-sweetie, um,

09:41.473 --> 09:44.517
it's just not your normal smile,
which is so beautiful.

09:45.442 --> 09:46.882
You mean I'm not beautiful?

09:46.883 --> 09:48.725
No, that's not what we're saying.

09:48.726 --> 09:51.702
Just forget it!
I don't want to do this anymore!

09:51.702 --> 09:52.696
I'm an ugly monster,

09:52.697 --> 09:55.042
and I'm never coming out
of my room again!

09:56.206 --> 09:58.082
Okay. Well, that was a disaster.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.082
Agreed. But can I just say

09:59.083 --> 10:00.711
I love how melodramatic
she's getting?

10:00.712 --> 10:02.698
So fantastic.

10:02.699 --> 10:04.407
- The little...
- I know.

10:05.346 --> 10:06.396
There she is.

10:06.397 --> 10:10.046
Hi, mi amor.
Happy anniversary!

10:10.047 --> 10:11.998
Happy anniversary, honey.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.442
I hope you like this.

10:13.443 --> 10:15.604
What did you get me?

10:17.839 --> 10:19.579
What did you get me?

10:20.430 --> 10:21.484
It's a bunny, mom.

10:21.485 --> 10:22.730
It's a little rough
around the edges,

10:22.731 --> 10:24.874
but I'm just hoping you'll love
what I put into it.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.699
Oh, you put something inside?!

10:30.026 --> 10:31.648
I don't get it.
There's nothing inside.

10:31.649 --> 10:34.360
Yeah, that's, uh...
'Cause, um...

10:34.464 --> 10:37.983
The damn stupid jeweler
didn't put the bracelet in there.

10:38.816 --> 10:41.749
The rose gold with the waves
that I told you that I loved?

10:42.458 --> 10:43.462
Yeah. Yeah, that's the one.

10:43.463 --> 10:43.966
Jay.

10:43.967 --> 10:45.022
No, it's fine, Manny.

10:45.023 --> 10:46.488
I can run down to the store
right now and get it.

10:46.489 --> 10:47.397
Stupid jeweler!

10:47.398 --> 10:48.400
Ay, Jay, don't scream at him.

10:48.401 --> 10:50.574
It was an honest mistake.

10:50.575 --> 10:51.081
Yeah, in his heart,

10:51.082 --> 10:53.208
he was probably trying
to do the right thing.

10:54.375 --> 10:55.823
And past the Millikan library,

10:55.824 --> 10:57.411
you'll find the bridge annex,

10:57.412 --> 10:59.531
which is also the same site

10:59.532 --> 11:01.657
that Carl D. Anderson
discovered the...?

11:01.658 --> 11:02.619
Neutron.

11:02.784 --> 11:03.704
Anyone else?

11:03.705 --> 11:04.920
- Positron.
- Positron.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.050
That's right.

11:06.660 --> 11:07.520
In 1932...

11:07.521 --> 11:08.311
On August 2nd...

11:08.312 --> 11:09.158
On the third floor.

11:09.159 --> 11:10.178
Really?

11:10.517 --> 11:12.424
I-I don't know.
Maybe I just wanted to win.

11:14.434 --> 11:15.490
I'm Jason.

11:15.491 --> 11:16.512
Alex.

11:17.185 --> 11:18.768
Is this your first-choice school?

11:18.829 --> 11:20.273
No, I'm thinking M.I.T..

11:20.274 --> 11:20.793
That's weird.

11:20.794 --> 11:22.415
I live just half an hour from there.

11:23.418 --> 11:25.305
Which explains why
you want to go here.

11:25.306 --> 11:27.770
I live here, and I want to go
somewhere on the East Coast.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.235
Really?
I'd love to be close to home.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.102
Sunday dinners, laundry,

11:32.103 --> 11:33.048
make sure my brother
doesn't mess with

11:33.049 --> 11:35.324
my hand-painted
civil war miniatures...

11:36.188 --> 11:38.047
Which I don't cherish.

11:38.559 --> 11:40.002
So why not M.I.T.?

11:40.003 --> 11:42.496
Well, for applied physics,
this is the better program,

11:42.497 --> 11:44.252
and I'm not gonna make
the biggest decision of my life

11:44.253 --> 11:46.065
based off where my parents live.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.983
Okay, then.

11:48.793 --> 11:50.644
Sorry.
Did that... sound judgey?

11:51.154 --> 11:53.836
I'm not really good
at talking to pretty girls.

11:53.837 --> 11:55.921
I -- well, I have
a touch of Asperger's.

11:56.225 --> 11:56.725
No, I don't.

11:56.726 --> 11:58.465
I just said that so you'd think
I was interesting.

11:58.466 --> 12:01.863
I was... just sorta hoping
you'd be going here.

12:02.011 --> 12:02.858
Really?

12:03.241 --> 12:04.564
Did my mother
put you up to this?

12:04.565 --> 12:06.787
Does your mom
tell boys to flirt with you?

12:06.788 --> 12:09.209
Oh. You're -- you're --
you're flirting with me.

12:09.210 --> 12:11.028
I mean, I don't mean
to sound so surprised.

12:11.029 --> 12:12.630
A lot of boys flirt with me.

12:13.771 --> 12:14.588
Not a lot. Some.

12:14.589 --> 12:16.839
Actually, one of them
has Asperger's.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.469
He could tell you the weather
on the day you were born.

12:19.470 --> 12:21.267
Okay. Well, I don't know
why I said that.

12:21.268 --> 12:25.615
The point is, I am single,
by my own choosing, so...

12:26.199 --> 12:26.824
Oh, my God!

12:26.825 --> 12:28.567
I am fine! I'm fine!
Everything's fine!

12:32.433 --> 12:33.614
I have to push it.

12:33.845 --> 12:34.830
It's all I can think of.

12:34.831 --> 12:36.764
Just let him push it.
Who cares?

12:36.765 --> 12:38.694
No one is touching this button!

12:38.695 --> 12:40.046
Don't you see?

12:40.047 --> 12:42.166
This is a test of character

12:42.167 --> 12:43.642
to see if we're the kind
of people with self-control

12:43.643 --> 12:45.338
or the kind who just grab
at any piece of cheese

12:45.339 --> 12:46.744
that's put in front of them.

12:47.741 --> 12:49.458
Don't you want
to know what it does?

12:49.459 --> 12:51.116
"Want to know what it does"?

12:51.117 --> 12:52.703
Of course I do.
It's killing me.

12:52.704 --> 12:53.496
But what I want more

12:53.497 --> 12:55.547
is for you to learn
to follow the rules.

12:55.824 --> 12:57.618
Is this about me
skipping class again?

12:57.619 --> 13:00.167
It's weird how obsessed
you are with that.

13:00.168 --> 13:01.324
Now let me push that button!

13:01.325 --> 13:01.825
No!

13:01.826 --> 13:03.303
If you can't even
pass a simple test,

13:03.304 --> 13:05.128
how are you ever gonna get
in to a good college?

13:05.129 --> 13:07.207
Or hold down a job?
We only have one basement.

13:07.208 --> 13:08.279
There's no place
for you to move

13:08.280 --> 13:09.084
when your life bottoms out!

13:09.593 --> 13:10.636
Okay.
Wow!

13:11.700 --> 13:13.020
Dad, I cut that class

13:13.021 --> 13:15.361
because I had to get
one last shot for my movie.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.151
You would've done
the same thing.

13:18.705 --> 13:20.604
Oh, my God!

13:20.888 --> 13:22.684
You're not mad at me.

13:23.060 --> 13:25.916
You're mad at yourself
because I'm just like you.

13:28.184 --> 13:29.750
Total shot in the dark.

13:29.751 --> 13:32.711
You're right --
I set a terrible example for you.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.059
No! It was awesome!

13:35.138 --> 13:37.500
Do you think Steve Jobs
followed every rule?

13:37.651 --> 13:38.416
Doug Henning?

13:38.417 --> 13:39.444
Keep talking.

13:39.445 --> 13:41.386
What about that guy
who lived in that town

13:41.387 --> 13:43.267
where people
weren't allowed to dance?

13:43.268 --> 13:44.787
Did Footloose follow the rules?

13:44.788 --> 13:46.765
His name was Ren,
and he most certainly did not.

13:46.766 --> 13:49.140
Maybe that's what those
scientists are looking for --

13:49.141 --> 13:50.231
Rebels!

13:51.479 --> 13:52.495
You know what?

13:52.654 --> 13:55.267
Who gives a hoot what
those bastards want?

13:55.268 --> 13:56.033
No offense.

13:56.034 --> 13:58.797
We're gonna break every rule,
and we're pushing that button!

13:58.798 --> 13:59.704
Yeah!

13:59.705 --> 14:01.426
Back away from the button!

14:01.451 --> 14:02.380
What are you doing?

14:02.381 --> 14:03.842
I've been breaking
the rules my entire life,

14:03.843 --> 14:04.738
and look where it's gotten me.

14:04.739 --> 14:06.149
I live in my parents' basement!

14:06.150 --> 14:08.534
I'm sick of being
a failure at everything!

14:08.849 --> 14:10.729
Oh, my God!

14:10.730 --> 14:12.148
You're not mad at us.

14:12.149 --> 14:13.089
You're mad at yourself.

14:13.090 --> 14:14.758
That's what I'm saying!

14:16.920 --> 14:17.907
Where were you?

14:17.908 --> 14:19.109
Consoling Jay.

14:19.110 --> 14:21.385
That bunny wasn't the only thing
you shattered, lady.

14:21.386 --> 14:22.858
When you first started dating him,

14:22.859 --> 14:24.096
what was his nickname for you?

14:24.097 --> 14:25.831
Sexy pants.

14:26.076 --> 14:26.776
The other one.

14:26.777 --> 14:27.816
Bunny.

14:28.998 --> 14:33.679
Oh, so that's why he put
the bracelet inside the bunny.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.993
There was no bracelet.

14:34.994 --> 14:36.716
The bunny was the present.

14:36.886 --> 14:37.771
That?

14:37.772 --> 14:39.401
He made it for you himself.

14:39.402 --> 14:39.967
No.

14:39.968 --> 14:42.384
In a pottery class
he's been taking for weeks.

14:42.385 --> 14:42.916
No!

14:42.917 --> 14:44.120
And you smashed it
on the counter.

14:44.121 --> 14:46.256
And he was too embarrassed
to say anything.

14:46.257 --> 14:47.594
No!

14:47.996 --> 14:49.057
I can't take it!

14:49.058 --> 14:50.861
Glue! Okay, give me glue!

14:50.862 --> 14:52.164
I need glue!

14:54.151 --> 14:55.904
Make it stop!

14:59.249 --> 15:00.385
Haley, put down the chair.

15:00.386 --> 15:01.115
Why should I?!

15:01.116 --> 15:02.518
Because this is getting absurd,

15:02.519 --> 15:03.838
and it's no fun being laughed at

15:03.839 --> 15:06.064
by a room full of scientists
and a monkey in a diaper.

15:06.065 --> 15:07.617
Yeah!
We need to push that button,

15:07.618 --> 15:09.374
show those eggheads
that we're not sheep!

15:09.375 --> 15:11.993
No! Breaking the rules
doesn't make you a hero!

15:11.994 --> 15:13.475
It makes you a screw-up!

15:13.476 --> 15:14.477
Take it from me, Luke --

15:14.478 --> 15:15.724
one out of a million dropouts

15:15.725 --> 15:17.095
becomes Steve Jobs.

15:17.096 --> 15:19.623
Do you know who become
losers with no jobs?

15:19.624 --> 15:21.626
The other 99,000!

15:21.878 --> 15:24.057
Honey, you are not a loser.

15:24.058 --> 15:25.483
Oh, please.

15:25.484 --> 15:27.594
I hear the shots
you all take at me.

15:27.595 --> 15:29.792
I see my sister
about to lap me

15:29.793 --> 15:31.847
at a college that I would
never be able to get into.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.873
Even someone as dumb as me

15:33.874 --> 15:36.340
can see that I'm a giant failure!

15:37.402 --> 15:39.547
Haley, stop, okay?

15:40.069 --> 15:41.186
Haley, let me tell you something --

15:41.187 --> 15:44.192
you have value,
talent, and potential

15:44.193 --> 15:45.873
that their tests can't measure.

15:46.128 --> 15:47.817
Who cares if you don't fit
into their little box.

15:47.818 --> 15:48.591
You're finding your way.

15:48.592 --> 15:50.488
That's what your 20s are for --

15:50.620 --> 15:51.553
to take chances...

15:51.554 --> 15:54.221
To -- to make mistakes
and to learn from them,

15:54.222 --> 15:55.830
and you are learning from them.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.869
The fact that you won't push
this button proves that.

16:00.236 --> 16:02.036
That was really sweet, dad.

16:02.401 --> 16:03.763
I can't believe
I was gonna hit you

16:03.764 --> 16:05.424
over the head with that chair.

16:05.635 --> 16:07.750
Wait. So now we're not
pushing the button?

16:07.751 --> 16:09.589
No. We're supporting Haley.

16:09.590 --> 16:10.656
For the rest of your life.

16:10.657 --> 16:12.478
That is not helpful.

16:13.177 --> 16:14.559
We need to stick together.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.508
Oh, my God.

16:15.509 --> 16:16.603
Oh, my God.

16:16.604 --> 16:18.360
That's what this test is.

16:18.873 --> 16:20.562
It's not about whether
we push the button

16:20.563 --> 16:22.209
or don't push the button.

16:22.210 --> 16:25.907
You want to find out
if this unites us or divides us.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.295
Let's join hands

16:29.390 --> 16:31.544
and send these sons of bitches

16:31.545 --> 16:34.477
and their filthy monkey a message!

16:44.381 --> 16:45.462
Feels good.

16:46.702 --> 16:47.652
Wait a minute.

16:47.653 --> 16:49.197
How are they gonna know
we're sending them a message

16:49.198 --> 16:50.812
if we're not doing anything?

16:50.906 --> 16:51.987
That's true.

16:52.530 --> 16:53.847
We have to hit that button.

16:53.848 --> 16:55.336
Damn straight.

16:55.905 --> 16:56.810
Yeah.

17:05.863 --> 17:06.565
Who did that?

17:06.566 --> 17:07.502
We did...

17:07.769 --> 17:08.989
as a family.

17:08.990 --> 17:10.634
Did you not see the sign?

17:10.635 --> 17:12.815
Now the A.C. won't shut off.
We have to call a guy.

17:12.816 --> 17:14.858
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this...

17:14.858 --> 17:16.013
what if, uh...

17:17.333 --> 17:18.824
Yeah, building full of scientists

17:18.825 --> 17:21.317
and no one thought
to push the button twice.

17:21.352 --> 17:23.320
Please use number 2 pencils.

17:29.752 --> 17:30.855
Yeah, just wall.

17:30.932 --> 17:32.918
So this is the... test.

17:33.239 --> 17:35.331
I got that cleared up
with the jeweler.

17:35.331 --> 17:37.014
Boy, was he embarrassed.

17:37.291 --> 17:38.353
What's that?

17:38.661 --> 17:39.280
Is that my bunny?

17:39.281 --> 17:41.691
No. I am your bunny.

17:41.692 --> 17:43.754
Jay, I don't want
that bracelet anymore.

17:43.755 --> 17:46.704
This is the most amazing gift
you have ever given me.

17:46.705 --> 17:48.656
Really?
You--you--you like it?

17:48.657 --> 17:49.865
I love it.

17:49.866 --> 17:51.076
And putting it back together

17:51.077 --> 17:53.648
made me realize how much
work you put into it.

17:53.649 --> 17:56.486
Well, it--it's all in the details, really.

17:56.487 --> 17:57.662
The bunny was in the clay.

17:57.663 --> 17:59.426
I just had to find it.

17:59.427 --> 18:00.831
Now I'm going
to give you yours.

18:00.832 --> 18:02.765
I think it's about that time.

18:03.881 --> 18:05.841
And this would be, um...

18:05.870 --> 18:08.310
a bookmark made of movie tickets

18:08.311 --> 18:11.256
from the first movie
we ever saw together.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.897
I-I-I love it.

18:13.031 --> 18:15.564
It's the kind of thing
I'd never get for myself.

18:15.565 --> 18:16.480
Ever.

18:17.537 --> 18:19.868
This is what we should
always do for each other--

18:19.869 --> 18:21.907
thoughtful, handmade gifts.

18:21.908 --> 18:24.049
We get too caught up in--
in material possessions.

18:24.049 --> 18:25.647
Ah, we got too much stuff.

18:25.649 --> 18:26.932
Return this first thing tomorrow.

18:26.933 --> 18:29.439
Yeah, and I'm gonna return
the watch that I bought you.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.835
Dinner's ready!

18:32.418 --> 18:35.305
So, is that the rose gold
bracelet that I wanted?

18:35.306 --> 18:36.700
Dynamite piece of jewelry.

18:36.701 --> 18:37.510
And that watch--

18:37.511 --> 18:40.997
is that the ceramic with the 10-day,
uh, power reserve?

18:40.998 --> 18:43.012
Of course.
It's so sexy, that watch.

18:43.013 --> 18:43.901
Yeah, the matte finish

18:43.902 --> 18:46.033
doesn't always catch the sun
and blind you like this one.

18:46.034 --> 18:49.522
It's so interesting, 'cause I love
shiny things on my wrist.

18:49.523 --> 18:52.801
Oh, for God sakes,
just keep the stupid gifts.

18:56.128 --> 18:57.140
Hello?

18:57.141 --> 18:58.857
Hey, it's me.

18:58.859 --> 19:00.632
I think Cam and I
made a huge mistake.

19:00.633 --> 19:02.337
Oh, I get it.
Marriage is tough.

19:02.338 --> 19:03.183
Just take a deep breath

19:03.184 --> 19:04.883
and go flirt with somebody
at the grocery store.

19:05.652 --> 19:07.323
No, about Lily.

19:07.325 --> 19:08.787
We're trying to take
this new family picture,

19:08.788 --> 19:11.833
and she's doing
this weird smile thing...

19:11.833 --> 19:13.103
And you said something?

19:13.104 --> 19:16.085
Uh, well, let's--
let's just say Cam did.

19:16.086 --> 19:18.312
First of all,
all kids go through this.

19:18.313 --> 19:19.431
You should see every picture

19:19.432 --> 19:20.606
we have of Luke
from third grade.

19:20.607 --> 19:22.854
He looks like he's mid-sneeze,
which is a shame,

19:22.855 --> 19:24.517
'cause I was having
a great boob year.

19:25.301 --> 19:26.311
What did you do?

19:26.312 --> 19:28.596
I think it might've been the birth control
I was taking, but...

19:28.597 --> 19:29.840
No, come on. About Luke!

19:29.841 --> 19:32.176
Oh! Nothing.
We didn't do anything.

19:32.177 --> 19:34.285
Mitchell, I say this with love,

19:34.286 --> 19:35.523
but when you became a parent,

19:35.524 --> 19:37.231
I knew this was gonna be
a problem for you

19:37.232 --> 19:38.657
'cause you like
to control everything.

19:38.658 --> 19:40.546
Good lord. What would
that sound like without love?

19:40.547 --> 19:42.641
Bottom line--
It's all gonna work itself out.

19:42.642 --> 19:43.579
But if you push her on it,

19:43.580 --> 19:45.515
she's just gonna push you away.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.364
Oh, my God.

19:48.436 --> 19:49.815
Thanks for coming, everybody.

19:49.816 --> 19:52.007
As you know,
our acceptance rate is 8%,

19:52.008 --> 19:55.264
so in the fall, I look forward
to seeing one out of...

19:55.265 --> 19:56.098
- 12.5.
- 12.5.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.439
12.5.

19:58.720 --> 19:59.961
So... not him.
Okay.

20:05.069 --> 20:06.995
Well, I guess this is it, M.I.T..

20:07.560 --> 20:09.305
Uh, when you visit Boston,
look me up...

20:09.306 --> 20:10.107
Darling.

20:10.108 --> 20:12.091
Okay, sweetie.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.988
Uh, t-that's my last name--
Jason Darling.

20:14.989 --> 20:17.072
Oh, well, Alex Dunphy--

20:17.073 --> 20:17.910
"P-H" not "F",

20:17.911 --> 20:18.915
"Y" not "E-E".

20:18.916 --> 20:20.069
"D-U-N-P-H"...

20:20.070 --> 20:21.639
Why am I still talking?

20:25.674 --> 20:26.502
All right.

20:29.022 --> 20:29.908
Bye.

20:31.184 --> 20:32.430
There you are.

20:33.054 --> 20:36.950
Listen, honey, I am so sorry
about pushing so hard earlier.

20:36.951 --> 20:39.490
If anyone is able
to make a smart decision

20:39.491 --> 20:41.531
about where to go
to school, it's you.

20:41.706 --> 20:43.395
Even if that school
is all the way

20:43.396 --> 20:45.088
on the other side
of the country.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.006
Actually, there's
a lot to like here.

20:49.084 --> 20:50.292
Really?!

20:51.843 --> 20:53.003
That's cool.

20:53.025 --> 20:53.982
Whatever.

20:55.124 --> 20:57.036
I guess there's somebody
around here

20:57.037 --> 20:59.623
she's not ready
to say goodbye to.

21:00.172 --> 21:01.396
He friended me!

21:04.372 --> 21:06.686
Okay, come on,
we have something to show you.

21:06.687 --> 21:09.267
Is it dinner, or is my mouth
too ugly to put food in?

21:09.268 --> 21:09.932
Okay, no.

21:09.933 --> 21:12.288
And please don't say things
like that about yourself.

21:12.289 --> 21:12.939
You picked one?

21:12.940 --> 21:13.666
We sure did,

21:13.667 --> 21:15.973
and we're sorry
we made you feel bad.

21:15.974 --> 21:17.515
We just weren't used
to your new smile,

21:17.516 --> 21:19.090
but now we are,
and we love it!

21:19.091 --> 21:21.515
Yes, it's beautiful,
and you're beautiful,

21:21.516 --> 21:23.381
and we don't want to change
a single thing about you.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.036
Except maybe your underpants.

21:27.780 --> 21:28.817
Okay, where did
that laugh come from?

21:28.818 --> 21:30.410
I don't know, but it's gotta go.
