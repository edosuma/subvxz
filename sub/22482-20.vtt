19:52.321 --> 19:54.236
Told you.

20:04.377 --> 20:06.379
Oh, God.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.816
We're in Vietnam again?

20:10.992 --> 20:13.386
[sighs]
This is me doing nice things.

20:13.516 --> 20:16.432
'Cause that's what I do--
I'm a nice thing doer.

20:18.869 --> 20:20.567
CHRISTY:
Oops.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.789
Gus?

20:26.834 --> 20:28.575
Did you eat my sandwich?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.231
And the plate?

See you later, Mom!

20:36.322 --> 20:38.367
Enjoy your sandwich!
