00:07.999 --> 00:09.999
TONIGHT ON "THE PROFIT,"

00:09.999 --> 00:12.999
I HEAD TO SOUTH CAROLINA

00:09.999 --> 00:12.999
TO GET A REAL TASTE

00:12.999 --> 00:14.999
OF GOOD OLD-FASHIONED BARBECUE.

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
Norton:

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
IF THE FAT AIN'T DRIPPING

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
ON THE COALS, IT'S NOT BARBECUE.

00:16.999 --> 00:20.999
Lemonis: A MOM-AND-POP OPERATION

00:16.999 --> 00:20.999
HAS QUICKLY GROWN INTO

00:20.999 --> 00:21.999
A MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS.

00:21.999 --> 00:22.999
YOU'RE ALMOST DOING $1 MILLION

00:21.999 --> 00:22.999
A YEAR.

00:22.999 --> 00:24.999
YOU GUYS AREN'T MOM-AND-POP

00:22.999 --> 00:24.999
ANYMORE.

00:24.999 --> 00:26.999
THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP.

00:26.999 --> 00:29.999
Norton: WE'VE GROWN FASTER THAN

00:26.999 --> 00:29.999
WE EVER IMAGINED WE WOULD GROW.

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
WE HAVE NOT CAUGHT UP

00:29.999 --> 00:31.999
WITH OURSELVES.

00:31.999 --> 00:32.999
Lynn: THIS IS OVERWHELMING.

00:32.999 --> 00:35.999
Lemonis:

00:32.999 --> 00:35.999
AUTHENTIC, DOWN-HOME COOKING

00:32.999 --> 00:35.999
NEVER GOES OUT OF STYLE.

00:35.999 --> 00:36.999
Lynn: MOM ALWAYS TAUGHT US,

00:36.999 --> 00:38.999
WHATEVER WE DO,

00:36.999 --> 00:38.999
WE DO AT OUR BEST.

00:38.999 --> 00:40.999
Lemonis: IF I CAN STABILIZE

00:38.999 --> 00:40.999
THIS BUSINESS...

00:40.999 --> 00:41.999
WE'RE NOT CHARGING ENOUGH.

00:41.999 --> 00:43.999
...THERE'S BIG MONEY TO BE MADE.

00:43.999 --> 00:46.999
THIS MEAL WAS AMAZING.

00:43.999 --> 00:46.999
THESE RIBS ARE RIDICULOUS.

00:47.999 --> 00:51.999
MY NAME IS MARCUS LEMONIS,

00:47.999 --> 00:51.999
AND I FIX FAILING BUSINESSES.

00:51.999 --> 00:53.999
IF YOU DON'T LIKE MONEY,

00:51.999 --> 00:53.999
DON'T FOLLOW MY ADVICE.

00:54.999 --> 00:56.999
I MAKE THE TOUGH DECISIONS.

00:56.999 --> 00:57.999
WE'RE CLOSING THE STORE.

00:56.999 --> 00:57.999
WE'RE DONE.

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU ABOUT IT

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
ANYMORE.

00:59.999 --> 01:02.999
I BACK THEM UP,

00:59.999 --> 01:02.999
SPENDING MY OWN MONEY.

01:02.999 --> 01:03.999
IT'S NOT ALWAYS PRETTY...

01:03.999 --> 01:06.999
Man: PERFECT FLAVOR.

01:06.999 --> 01:07.999
Lemonis:

01:06.999 --> 01:07.999
...BUT THIS IS BUSINESS.

01:07.999 --> 01:09.000
YOU GOT TO TRUST THE PROCESS.

01:09.999 --> 01:12.000
I DO IT TO SAVE JOBS,

01:09.999 --> 01:12.000
AND I DO IT TO MAKE MONEY.

01:12.999 --> 01:13.999
THANKS FOR YOUR BUSINESS.

01:13.999 --> 01:15.999
THIS IS "THE PROFIT."

01:22.999 --> 01:27.999
THINGS MOVE SLOWLY IN THE SMALL

01:22.999 --> 01:27.999
TOWN OF LATTA, SOUTH CAROLINA.

01:27.999 --> 01:29.999
BUT WHEN SHULER'S BAR-B-QUE

01:27.999 --> 01:29.999
OPENS ITS DOORS,

01:29.999 --> 01:32.999
PEOPLE NEAR AND FAR

01:29.999 --> 01:32.999
COME RUSHING IN

01:32.999 --> 01:34.999
WITH SOME TRAVELING

01:32.999 --> 01:34.999
HUNDREDS OF MILES

01:34.999 --> 01:36.999
TO EAT THEIR LEGENDARY BARBECUE.

01:36.999 --> 01:39.999
Lynn: HI. HOW ARE Y'ALL?

01:36.999 --> 01:39.999
WELCOME TO SHULER'S.

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
Lemonis: IT'S AN ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
BARBECUE BUFFET,

01:41.999 --> 01:44.999
AND THEIR SPECIALITY

01:41.999 --> 01:44.999
IS PULLED PORK AND RIBS.

01:44.999 --> 01:48.999
THEIR BISCUITS ARE ALWAYS

01:44.999 --> 01:48.999
ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRAWS.

01:48.999 --> 01:51.999
Woman: EXCELLENT BARBECUE, SOME

01:48.999 --> 01:51.999

01:51.999 --> 01:52.999

01:52.999 --> 01:55.999
AND NORTON HUGHES

01:55.999 --> 01:58.999
STRUGGLED TO HAVE A FAMILY

01:55.999 --> 01:58.999
UNTIL LATE IN LIFE.

01:58.999 --> 02:01.999
THEY WERE BLESSED WHEN

01:58.999 --> 02:01.999
THEY ADOPTED THEIR YOUNG SON

02:01.999 --> 02:04.999
AND NAMED HIM AFTER

02:01.999 --> 02:04.999
NORTON'S FATHER, SHULER.

02:04.999 --> 02:07.999
LYNN AND NORTON OPENED UP

02:04.999 --> 02:07.999
SHULER'S BAR-B-QUE RESTAURANT

02:07.999 --> 02:12.999
IN 1996 WITHOUT ANY

02:07.999 --> 02:12.999
PRIOR RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE.

02:12.999 --> 02:15.999
THEY'VE RELIED ON

02:12.999 --> 02:15.999
TIME-TESTED FAMILY RECIPES...

02:15.999 --> 02:16.999
Norton: I CAN REMEMBER MY DADDY

02:15.999 --> 02:16.999
PUTTING MEAT ON THE COALS.

02:16.999 --> 02:18.999
THAT SHOWS YOU

02:16.999 --> 02:18.999
WE'RE COOKING RIGHT.

02:18.999 --> 02:20.000
Lemonis: ...AND TRADITIONAL

02:18.999 --> 02:20.000
COOKING PRACTICES

02:20.999 --> 02:23.999
PASSED DOWN BY NORTON'S FATHER.

02:23.999 --> 02:26.999
THIS BUSINESS HAS GROWN BIGGER

02:23.999 --> 02:26.999
THAN THEY EVER EXPECTED,

02:26.999 --> 02:29.999
FORCING THEM TO WORK AROUND

02:26.999 --> 02:29.999
THE CLOCK JUST TO KEEP UP.

02:32.999 --> 02:33.999
Lynn: [ SIGHS ]

02:33.999 --> 02:34.999
Lemonis:

02:33.999 --> 02:34.999
LYNN AND NORTON'S GOAL IS

02:34.999 --> 02:37.999
TO BUILD A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS

02:34.999 --> 02:37.999
FOR THE FUTURE OF THEIR SON,

02:37.999 --> 02:40.999
BUT I KNOW THAT

02:37.999 --> 02:40.999
SECOND-GENERATION BUSINESSES

02:40.999 --> 02:41.999
HAVE A HIGH FAILURE RATE.

02:41.999 --> 02:43.999
SO, IF I CAN'T PUT

02:41.999 --> 02:43.999
THE RIGHT PROCESSES

02:43.999 --> 02:44.999
AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE,

02:44.999 --> 02:47.999
THIS BUSINESS MAY NOT MAKE IT

02:44.999 --> 02:47.999
TO THE NEXT GENERATION.

03:29.999 --> 03:31.999

03:29.999 --> 03:31.999
IN THE ENTIRE PLACE?

03:31.999 --> 03:33.999
Lynn: ABOUT 200.

03:33.999 --> 03:35.999

03:33.999 --> 03:35.999
A TIME WHERE IT'S JAM-PACKED,

03:35.999 --> 03:36.999

03:36.999 --> 03:38.999
WE HAVE PICTURES OF IT

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
AT ABOUT HALFWAY IN

03:38.999 --> 03:40.999
THE PARKING LOT.

03:40.999 --> 03:41.999
THAT IS NOT REAL UNUSUAL.

03:41.999 --> 03:44.999
WE CAN FEED AS MANY

03:41.999 --> 03:44.999
AS 500 PEOPLE IN A NIGHT.

03:44.999 --> 03:46.999

03:44.999 --> 03:46.999
OUT OF SEATS IN THE DINING AREA

03:46.999 --> 03:48.999
AND THEN HAVE TO TURN CUSTOMERS

03:46.999 --> 03:48.999
AWAY?

03:48.999 --> 03:49.999

03:50.000 --> 03:51.999

05:03.999 --> 05:05.999
WE CAN'T KEEP BISCUITS

05:03.999 --> 05:05.999

05:43.999 --> 05:44.999
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER.

05:44.999 --> 05:46.999
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SOME TONIGHT,

05:44.999 --> 05:46.999
RIGHT?

05:46.999 --> 05:48.999
Lemonis: I'M GONNA HAVE SOME.

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
HOW PROFITABLE IS

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
THE BUSINESS TODAY?

05:51.999 --> 05:53.999
Norton: IT'LL RUN 12%, 15%.

05:53.999 --> 05:56.999
THIS YEAR, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE

05:53.999 --> 05:56.999
A PROBLEM DOING $1 MILLION.

05:56.999 --> 05:58.999
Lemonis: SO, THE BUSINESS

05:56.999 --> 05:58.999
WILL MAKE $120,000, $150,000.

05:58.999 --> 06:01.999
Norton: YEAH. YOU KNOW,

05:58.999 --> 06:01.999
WE'RE STILL MOM-AND-POP.

06:01.999 --> 06:02.999
WE ACTUALLY DON'T PAY OURSELF

06:01.999 --> 06:02.999
A SALARY.

06:02.999 --> 06:03.999
Lynn: WE WOULD LOVE TO GET SETUP

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO PAY

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
A MANAGER

06:05.999 --> 06:06.999
BECAUSE THIS IS OVERWHELMING.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.999
Lemonis:

06:06.999 --> 06:09.999
WHILE SHULER'S BAR-B-QUE'S ONLY

06:06.999 --> 06:09.999
OPEN THREE DAYS A WEEK,

06:09.999 --> 06:13.999
IT'S OVERWHELMING BECAUSE

06:09.999 --> 06:13.999
IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT SERVING

06:09.999 --> 06:13.999
THE FOOD THREE DAYS A WEEK.

06:13.999 --> 06:16.999
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT GO

06:13.999 --> 06:16.999
INTO RUNNING A RESTAURANT,

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
AND THREE DAYS A WEEK

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
REALLY TURNS INTO

06:18.999 --> 06:19.999
SEVEN DAYS' WORTH OF WORK.

06:19.999 --> 06:22.999
Lynn: MY BROTHER-IN-LAW EWELL

06:19.999 --> 06:22.999
HAS STEPPED IN,

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
AND IT'S JUST BEEN A JOY

06:22.999 --> 06:24.999
HAVING HIM HERE.

06:24.999 --> 06:26.999
EWELL HAS BEEN IN

06:24.999 --> 06:26.999
MANAGERIAL POSITIONS.

06:26.999 --> 06:27.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

06:27.999 --> 06:29.999
Norton:

06:27.999 --> 06:29.999
HE IS A GENIUS WITH MARKETING.

06:29.999 --> 06:30.999
Lynn: SEE, HE'S BEEN WORKING

06:29.999 --> 06:30.999
WITH US ON THAT,

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
AND WE'VE JUST SEEN

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
A CONTINUAL GROWTH.

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
Lemonis: IT SEEMS TO ME

06:32.999 --> 06:34.999
THAT THEY NEED SOME HELP.

06:34.999 --> 06:35.999
THEY NEED A MANAGER.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
AND IF EWELL'S THAT ANSWER,

06:35.999 --> 06:37.999
WELL, I'D LIKE TO MEET HIM.

06:42.999 --> 06:44.999
I NEED BIGGER PLATES.

06:44.999 --> 06:45.999
HOW YOU DOING? I'M MARCUS.

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
Ewell: MARCUS? EWELL.

06:45.999 --> 06:47.999
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

06:47.999 --> 06:48.999
Lemonis: NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:48.999 --> 06:49.999
Jenny: HI. JENNY.

06:49.999 --> 06:50.999
Lemonis:

06:49.999 --> 06:50.999
JENNY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

06:50.999 --> 06:51.999
Jenny: MY SISTER.

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
Lemonis:

06:51.999 --> 06:53.999
SHE'S YOUR SISTER? OKAY.

06:53.999 --> 06:54.999
Lemonis:

06:53.999 --> 06:54.999
AND YOU ALL ARE MARRIED?

06:54.999 --> 06:56.999
-Both: YES.

06:54.999 --> 06:56.999
-Jenny: WE LIVE IN NEW ORLEANS.

06:56.999 --> 06:57.999
Ewell: SEAFOOD.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.999
I DID ALL THE PROMOTIONS

06:57.999 --> 06:59.999
FOR THE STATE.

06:59.999 --> 07:01.999
Lemonis: ARE YOU STILL IN

06:59.999 --> 07:01.999
THE SEAFOOD BUSINESS TODAY?

07:01.999 --> 07:02.999
Ewell: NO, I'M NOT.

07:02.999 --> 07:04.999
I RESIGNED,

07:02.999 --> 07:04.999
AND I'VE BEEN HELPING WITH THEM.

07:04.999 --> 07:06.999
-Lemonis: OH, OKAY.

07:04.999 --> 07:06.999
-Ewell: WE SEE A GOLD MINE HERE.

07:06.999 --> 07:08.999
AND FOR A MARKETER,

07:06.999 --> 07:08.999
THIS IS NIRVANA.

07:08.999 --> 07:10.999
YOU KNOW? IT'S A LOT OF FUN.

07:10.999 --> 07:13.999
SO, I STARTED PLAYING

07:10.999 --> 07:13.999
WITH THEIR FACEBOOK PAGE.

07:13.999 --> 07:15.999
AND WORD OF MOUTH

07:13.999 --> 07:15.999
IS SPREADING FASTER

07:15.999 --> 07:17.999
THAN THEY CAN HANDLE THE GROWTH.

07:17.999 --> 07:20.999
Lemonis:

07:17.999 --> 07:20.999
BUT WHY DO WE NEED MORE P.R.?

07:17.999 --> 07:20.999
WE HAVE A LINE OUT THE DOOR.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.999
Ewell: WE SEE SO MUCH POTENTIAL

07:22.999 --> 07:25.999
THAT WE CAN BUILD THIS BRAND

07:22.999 --> 07:25.999
BEYOND THIS LOCATION.

07:25.999 --> 07:27.999
Lemonis: NOW YOU'RE CHANGING

07:25.999 --> 07:27.999
THE SECRET RECIPE.

07:27.999 --> 07:29.999
THAT'S WHAT I WORRY ABOUT.

07:29.999 --> 07:31.999
THIS CONCEPT OF FRANCHISING

07:31.999 --> 07:33.999
AND OPENING THEM UP

07:31.999 --> 07:33.999
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

07:33.999 --> 07:36.999
IS NOT ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.999
IT'S NOT ICE CREAM.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.999
IT'S A BRAND

07:39.000 --> 07:41.999
THAT ISN'T PORTABLE.

07:41.999 --> 07:43.999
YOU GUYS CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE.

07:43.999 --> 07:45.999
FRANCHISING SHULER'S

07:43.999 --> 07:45.999
IS A BAD IDEA.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.000
BARBECUE IS REGIONAL.

07:47.999 --> 07:49.999
THERE ARE DIFFERENT STYLES

07:47.999 --> 07:49.999
AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT FLAVORS.

07:49.999 --> 07:52.999
JUST 30 MINUTES AWAY

07:49.999 --> 07:52.999
IN NORTH CAROLINA,

07:52.999 --> 07:54.999
THE BARBECUE COULD BE

07:52.999 --> 07:54.999
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

07:54.999 --> 07:56.999
IF I OPEN UP BARBECUE IN TEXAS,

07:54.999 --> 07:56.999
IT'S A PROBLEM

07:56.999 --> 07:59.999
BECAUSE I'M COMPETING AGAINST

07:56.999 --> 07:59.999
THAT REGION'S BARBECUE --

07:59.999 --> 08:01.999
NOT A BATTLE

07:59.999 --> 08:01.999
THAT I'M WILLING TO FIGHT.

08:01.999 --> 08:03.999
I'D MUCH RATHER TAKE THE MONEY

08:03.999 --> 08:05.000
AND BUILD INTO

08:03.999 --> 08:05.000
THE INFRASTRUCTURE HERE

08:05.999 --> 08:06.999
AND MAKE THIS A DESTINATION.

08:06.999 --> 08:08.999
THESE RIBS ARE RIDICULOUS.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
WHAT ARE YOU FOOD COSTS TODAY?

08:10.999 --> 08:11.999
DO YOU KNOW?

08:10.999 --> 08:11.999
AS A PERCENTAGE?

08:11.999 --> 08:14.999
Norton: 41%, 42%.

08:14.999 --> 08:16.000
NOW, 41% IS WHAT THE FOOD PEOPLE

08:14.999 --> 08:16.000
TELL US.

08:16.999 --> 08:17.999
41% IS GOOD.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
Lemonis: THE PEOPLE THAT SELL

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
YOU THE FOOD CAN TELL YOU THAT.

08:19.999 --> 08:20.999
Norton: [ CHUCKLES ]

08:20.999 --> 08:21.999
Lemonis: AND, YOU KNOW,

08:20.999 --> 08:21.999
YOUR FOOD COSTS BEING HIGH

08:22.000 --> 08:23.999
ARE A FUNCTION OF WHAT?

08:23.999 --> 08:25.999
WHAT DO YOU THINK, EWELL?

08:25.999 --> 08:26.999
Ewell:

08:25.999 --> 08:26.999
WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT FOOD COSTS?

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
I DON'T EVEN COOK. [ LAUGHS ]

08:28.999 --> 08:29.999
Norton: HOW MUCH THEY EAT?

08:29.999 --> 08:32.999
Lemonis: HOW MUCH THEY EAT.

08:29.999 --> 08:32.999
THAT'S ONE. WHAT ELSE?

08:32.999 --> 08:34.999
WHAT THEY PAY FOR IT.

08:34.999 --> 08:36.999
I COULDN'T GO TO WENDY'S...

08:36.999 --> 08:38.999
Lynn: OH, YEAH.

08:36.999 --> 08:38.999
WE'VE BEEN THERE. YEAH.

08:38.999 --> 08:40.999
Lemonis: ...FOR THIS PRICE.

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
-Lynn: THIS WOULD BE SHULER.

08:40.999 --> 08:42.999
-Lemonis: ARE YOU THE BOSS?

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
-Shuler: EH.

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
-Lemonis: I'M MARCUS.

08:44.999 --> 08:45.999
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:45.999 --> 08:48.999
DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU AND I

08:45.999 --> 08:48.999
HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON?

08:48.999 --> 08:49.999
WE'RE BOTH ADOPTED.

08:49.999 --> 08:50.999
Lynn: COOL.

08:50.999 --> 08:52.999
Lemonis:

08:50.999 --> 08:52.999
DO YOU KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE?

08:52.999 --> 08:53.999
Norton: I KNOW HOW LUCKY I AM.

08:53.999 --> 08:56.999
Lynn: HE IS OUR LIFE.

08:56.999 --> 08:59.999
WE SPENT A LONG TIME WAITING

08:56.999 --> 08:59.999
FOR THAT LITTLE FELLA.

08:59.999 --> 09:03.999
Lemonis:

08:59.999 --> 09:03.999
THE REAL GOAL IS TO BE ABLE TO

08:59.999 --> 09:03.999
BUILD A BEAUTIFUL BUSINESS

09:03.999 --> 09:04.999
FOR YOUR SON.

09:06.999 --> 09:10.999
Lynn: THIS BUSINESS IS US,

09:06.999 --> 09:10.999
AND WE ALL BEEN PART OF IT.

09:14.999 --> 09:16.999
Lemonis: WHILE I'M IMPRESSED BY

09:14.999 --> 09:16.999
THE FOOD...

09:16.999 --> 09:17.999
AND THE WATERMELON CAKE,

09:17.999 --> 09:18.999
-IT'S REALLY GOOD.

09:17.999 --> 09:18.999
-Woman: IT'S REALLY GOOD.

09:18.999 --> 09:21.999
Lemonis: ...I THINK THERE ARE

09:18.999 --> 09:21.999
A NUMBER OF QUICK FIXES

09:21.999 --> 09:23.999
THAT I CAN PUT IN PLACE TO

09:21.999 --> 09:23.999
ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

09:24.000 --> 09:25.999
AND IMPROVE THE ECONOMICS.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.999
COME TO DINNER, RIGHT?

09:25.999 --> 09:28.999
ADULT, CHILD -- 8 TO 12.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
THIS P.O.S. SYSTEM

09:28.999 --> 09:30.999
IS OVERLY COMPLICATED.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.999
[ Chuckling ] WE HAVE

09:31.000 --> 09:33.999
THE GASTRIC-BYPASS DISCOUNT,

09:33.999 --> 09:35.999
BUT WE DON'T HAVE

09:33.999 --> 09:35.999
THE MILITARY DISCOUNT.

09:35.999 --> 09:38.999
AND, QUITE FRANKLY,

09:35.999 --> 09:38.999
IT'S CAUSING A TRAFFIC JAM.

09:38.999 --> 09:39.999
COME ON IN, FOLKS. TWO ADULTS?

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
IT'S KIND OF A SHOCKER,

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
ISN'T IT?

09:42.999 --> 09:43.999
Woman: YEAH.

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
Lemonis: THE FACT THAT WE

09:43.999 --> 09:45.999
DON'T ACCEPT CREDIT CARDS

09:45.999 --> 09:46.999
SEEMS SLOW AND INEFFICIENT.

09:46.999 --> 09:48.999
WE NEED TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS,

09:48.999 --> 09:51.999
AND WE ALSO NEED TO ADD ANOTHER

09:48.999 --> 09:51.999
REGISTER TO SPEED THINGS UP.

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
I'M EXCITED

09:51.999 --> 09:53.999
TO GET EWELL INVOLVED,

09:53.999 --> 09:55.999
BECAUSE I THINK HE COULD BE

09:53.999 --> 09:55.999
A HUGE ASSET.

09:55.999 --> 09:57.999
SO, I WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE

09:55.999 --> 09:57.999
AND FIND OUT WHAT'S ON HIS MIND.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.999
Ewell: MY WIFE AND I,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.999
WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS AS, "OKAY.

10:00.999 --> 10:01.999
LET'S GO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY."

10:01.999 --> 10:03.999
I THINK THEY'RE AT

10:01.999 --> 10:03.999
A TIPPING POINT.

10:03.999 --> 10:07.999
AND IF THE SOCIAL MEDIA ALONE

10:07.999 --> 10:09.999
IS STARTING TO TAKE OFF

10:07.999 --> 10:09.999
WITHOUT THEM,

10:09.999 --> 10:10.999
THERE'S NO LIGHT

10:09.999 --> 10:10.999
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.

10:10.999 --> 10:13.999
Lemonis: SO, IS IT YOUR PLAN

10:10.999 --> 10:13.999
TO MOVE HERE?

10:13.999 --> 10:17.000
Ewell: IF THIS CAN WORK OUT IN A

10:13.999 --> 10:17.000
WAY WHERE WE CAN WORK WITH THEM,

10:17.999 --> 10:18.999
WORK WITH YOU,

10:17.999 --> 10:18.999
AND IT MAKES SENSE --

10:18.999 --> 10:21.000
Lemonis: ARE YOU INTERESTED

10:18.999 --> 10:21.000
IN BEING A PARTNER IN THE DEAL?

10:21.999 --> 10:22.999
Ewell:

10:21.999 --> 10:22.999
I THINK THAT WOULD BE EXCITING.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.999
-WITH YOU AS A PARTNER...

10:22.999 --> 10:24.999
-Lemonis: YEAH.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.999
Ewell:

10:24.999 --> 10:26.999
...WE SEE THE SKY AS THE LIMIT.

10:26.999 --> 10:29.999
Lemonis:

10:26.999 --> 10:29.999
WHEN YOU SAW "WE," DO YOU HAVE

10:26.999 --> 10:29.999
EQUITY IN THE BUSINESS TODAY?

10:29.999 --> 10:30.999
Ewell: NO, I DON'T.

10:30.999 --> 10:32.999
Lemonis: OKAY. IS THAT A GOAL?

10:32.999 --> 10:34.999
Ewell:

10:32.999 --> 10:34.999
IT'S A POSSIBILITY, ABSOLUTELY.

10:34.999 --> 10:37.999
Lemonis: I'M NOT REALLY SURE

10:34.999 --> 10:37.999
WHAT EWELL'S ANGLE IS HERE.

10:37.999 --> 10:39.999
IF HE WANTS TO BE A PARTNER,

10:37.999 --> 10:39.999
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

10:39.999 --> 10:41.999
BUT ALL I'M HEAR HIM

10:39.999 --> 10:41.999
TALKING ABOUT IS P.R.

10:42.999 --> 10:45.999
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD GO OVER

10:42.999 --> 10:45.999
SOME OF THE NUMBERS.

10:47.999 --> 10:49.999
LOOK AT YOUR PROFITABILITY.

10:49.999 --> 10:52.999
$723,000 IN SALES,

10:49.999 --> 10:52.999
MAKING $145,000.

10:52.999 --> 10:55.999
-IT'S GOT A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

10:52.999 --> 10:55.999
-Norton: YES.

10:55.999 --> 10:56.999
Lemonis: HOW MANY DAYS A WEEK

10:55.999 --> 10:56.999
ARE YOU OPEN?

10:56.999 --> 10:58.999
Norton: THREE DAYS.

10:58.999 --> 10:59.999
Lemonis: PRETTY GOOD.

10:59.999 --> 11:01.999
OF THIS $145,000

10:59.999 --> 11:01.999
THAT YOU MADE LAST YEAR,

11:01.999 --> 11:03.999
YOU DID NOT PAY YOURSELF

11:01.999 --> 11:03.999
A SALARY.

11:03.999 --> 11:06.999
Norton:

11:03.999 --> 11:06.999
WE TAKE PROBABLY $100,000 OR SO

11:03.999 --> 11:06.999
OUT OF IT TO LIVE OFF OF.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.999
Lemonis: YOU JUST TAKE YOUR

11:06.999 --> 11:08.999
PROFITS FROM YOUR BUSINESS.

11:10.999 --> 11:12.999
YOU'RE ALMOST DOING $1 MILLION

11:10.999 --> 11:12.999
A YEAR.

11:12.999 --> 11:14.999
YOU AIN'T SO MOM-AND-POP

11:12.999 --> 11:14.999
ANYMORE.

11:14.999 --> 11:17.999
DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU

11:14.999 --> 11:17.999
THAT YOUR FOOD COSTS ARE 42%?

11:17.999 --> 11:19.999
AND SO, WHO ORDERS ALL THE FOOD?

11:19.999 --> 11:21.999
Norton: I DO.

11:21.999 --> 11:22.999
Lemonis: FOOD COSTS

11:21.999 --> 11:22.999
AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES

11:23.000 --> 11:24.999
TELLS ME ONE OF THREE THINGS --

11:24.999 --> 11:25.999
YOU'RE PAYING TOO MUCH

11:24.999 --> 11:25.999
FOR IT, RIGHT?

11:25.999 --> 11:28.999
WE'RE NOT CHARGING ENOUGH,

11:25.999 --> 11:28.999
OR THERE'S A LOT OF WASTE.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.999
THE ONLY WAY WE GROW

11:29.000 --> 11:31.999
PROFITABILITY, RIGHT,

11:31.999 --> 11:33.999
IS TO EITHER LOWER FOOD COSTS

11:31.999 --> 11:33.999
OR GROW REVENUE.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.999
Norton: MM.

11:35.999 --> 11:36.999
Lemonis:

11:35.999 --> 11:36.999
DO YOU OWE ANYBODY ANY MONEY?

11:36.999 --> 11:39.999
Norton: WE OWE $86,000 TOTAL ON

11:36.999 --> 11:39.999
THAT MORTGAGE ON THE PROPERTY.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.999
Lemonis: WHAT ABOUT VENDORS?

11:41.999 --> 11:43.999
WHY DO I SEE "MERCHANT ACCOUNT

11:41.999 --> 11:43.999
FEES BANK CARD"?

11:43.999 --> 11:47.999
I THOUGHT I SAW A

11:43.999 --> 11:47.999
SIGN DOWNSTAIRS THAT

11:43.999 --> 11:47.999
SAYS "CASH ONLY"?

11:47.999 --> 11:48.999
Norton:

11:47.999 --> 11:48.999
WE DO CREDIT CARDS FOR CATERING.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.999
Lemonis: YOU DO TAKE CREDIT

11:48.999 --> 11:51.999
CARDS IN HALF YOUR BUSINESS

11:48.999 --> 11:51.999
BUT NOT DOWNSTAIRS?

11:51.999 --> 11:52.999
-Norton: NOT DOWNSTAIRS.

11:51.999 --> 11:52.999
-Lemonis: HOW COME?

11:52.999 --> 11:54.999
Norton: BY THE TIME YOU PUT ALL

11:52.999 --> 11:54.999
THE FEES TOGETHER

11:54.999 --> 11:57.999
AND BACK IT OUT AT THE END,

11:54.999 --> 11:57.999
YOU'RE LOOKING AT 1.5%.

11:57.999 --> 11:58.999
Lemonis:

11:57.999 --> 11:58.999
I'D RATHER YOU SPEND MORE TIME

11:58.999 --> 12:02.999
FIGURING HOW TO GET

11:58.999 --> 12:02.999
YOUR FOOD COSTS DOWN 3.5%

12:02.999 --> 12:05.999
AND THEN WORRY ABOUT

12:02.999 --> 12:05.999
THE CREDIT CARD THAT'S 1.5%.

12:05.999 --> 12:07.999
Lemonis:

12:05.999 --> 12:07.999
NORTON IS SO FIXED ON THE FACT

12:07.999 --> 12:10.999
THAT A CREDIT CARD CHARGES 1.5%.

12:10.999 --> 12:11.999
ON A SINGLE CUSTOMER,

12:11.999 --> 12:16.999
1.5% OF A $13.95 ADULT MEAL

12:11.999 --> 12:16.999
EQUALS 20 CENTS.

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
WHAT I'D RATHER HIM

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
BE FOCUSED ON

12:18.999 --> 12:20.999
IS THE FACT THAT HE'S

12:18.999 --> 12:20.999
TURNING AWAY CUSTOMERS

12:20.999 --> 12:22.999
BECAUSE THEY DON'T ACCEPT

12:20.999 --> 12:22.999
CREDIT CARDS.

12:22.999 --> 12:23.999
ON A GIVEN NIGHT,

12:23.999 --> 12:27.999
IF HE TURNS AWAY 5 CUSTOMERS

12:23.999 --> 12:27.999
ACROSS 156 NIGHTS,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.999
THE NUMBER OF NIGHTS HE'S OPEN,

12:29.999 --> 12:33.999
HE WOULD BE LOSING

12:29.999 --> 12:33.999
OUT ON $10,881 OF REVENUE.

12:33.999 --> 12:35.999
THAT'S A MUCH BIGGER NUMBER.

12:35.999 --> 12:37.999
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER

12:35.999 --> 12:37.999
COLLECT $10,000

12:37.999 --> 12:38.999
THAN WORRY ABOUT 20 CENTS?

12:38.999 --> 12:39.999
COME ON, NORTON.

12:42.999 --> 12:43.999
-HI, GUYS.

12:42.999 --> 12:43.999
-Lynn: HI.

12:43.999 --> 12:44.999
Norton: HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?

12:44.999 --> 12:47.999
Lemonis:

12:44.999 --> 12:47.999
WELL, I'VE ENJOYED MY TIME HERE.

12:47.999 --> 12:49.999
IT'S A GREAT FAMILY ATMOSPHERE

12:47.999 --> 12:49.999
FOR A BUSINESS.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.999
WHILE YOUR FOOD IS AMAZING,

12:52.999 --> 12:54.999
I THINK WHAT'S HERE

12:52.999 --> 12:54.999
IS MORE THAN FOOD.

12:54.999 --> 12:55.999
IT FEELS LIKE

12:54.999 --> 12:55.999
IT'S AN EXPERIENCE.

12:55.999 --> 12:57.999
Lynn: MM-HMM.

12:57.999 --> 13:00.999
Lemonis:

12:57.999 --> 13:00.999
AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE HAD

12:57.999 --> 13:00.999
GOOD SUCCESS USING YOUR GUT,

13:00.999 --> 13:01.999
AND I COMMEND YOU FOR IT.

13:01.999 --> 13:03.999
YOU GUYS HAVE BUILT

13:01.999 --> 13:03.999
A MILLION-DOLLAR BUSINESS

13:03.999 --> 13:07.000
THAT HAPPENS TO BE OPEN

13:03.999 --> 13:07.000
THREE DAYS A WEEK.

13:07.999 --> 13:10.999
BUT THE FOOD COSTS

13:07.999 --> 13:10.999
ARE THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE

13:10.999 --> 13:11.999
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

13:11.999 --> 13:12.999
Ewell: MM-HMM.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.999
Lemonis: AND, EWELL,

13:13.000 --> 13:15.999
IT'S NOT MY DECISION

13:15.999 --> 13:17.999
WHETHER YOU'RE INVOLVED IN

13:15.999 --> 13:17.999
THE BUSINESS OR NOT.

13:17.999 --> 13:18.999
Ewell: WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

13:18.999 --> 13:19.999
Lemonis:

13:18.999 --> 13:19.999
BUT, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.999
IT'S STILL CLOUDY FOR ME

13:20.000 --> 13:23.999
WHAT YOUR ROLE IS.

13:23.999 --> 13:25.999
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP

13:23.999 --> 13:25.999
CLEAN THAT UP FOR ME.

13:25.999 --> 13:27.999
Ewell: MY GOAL ALL ALONG

13:25.999 --> 13:27.999
IS JUST TO HELP THEM

13:27.999 --> 13:31.999
BUILDING THE BUSINESS HERE

13:27.999 --> 13:31.999
AND THEN GOING OUT.

13:31.999 --> 13:32.999
Lemonis:

13:31.999 --> 13:32.999
WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO HERE?

13:32.999 --> 13:34.999
DO YOU SEE YOURSELF WORKING

13:32.999 --> 13:34.999
IN THE KITCHEN?

13:34.999 --> 13:36.999
Ewell: "A" -- IT DEPENDS ON WHAT

13:34.999 --> 13:36.999
THE DEAL IS THAT YOU ALL DO.

13:36.999 --> 13:38.999
Lemonis: WHY WOULD THE DEAL

13:36.999 --> 13:38.999
THAT WE MAKE

13:38.999 --> 13:41.999
DETERMINE WHAT YOUR ROLE'S

13:38.999 --> 13:41.999
GONNA BE?

13:41.999 --> 13:43.999
Ewell: IT HAS TO MAKE SENSE

13:41.999 --> 13:43.999
FOR MYSELF AND MY WIFE

13:43.999 --> 13:46.999
TO UPROOT OUR LIVES

13:43.999 --> 13:46.999
AND COME OVER TO SOUTH CAROLINA.

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO KNOW

13:46.999 --> 13:48.999
THAT WE CAN GROW WITH IT.

13:48.999 --> 13:50.000
Lemonis: OKAY.

13:50.999 --> 13:55.999
THE BUSINESS TODAY, BEFORE YOU

13:50.999 --> 13:55.999
PAID YOURSELF, MADE $145,000.

13:55.999 --> 14:00.999
AFTER YOU TOOK YOUR SALARY,

13:55.999 --> 14:00.999
IT REALLY ONLY MADE $45,000.

14:00.999 --> 14:04.000
ANY SALARY THAT YOU GIVE OUT

14:00.999 --> 14:04.000
TO ANYBODY, FAMILY OR NOT,

14:04.999 --> 14:06.999
COULD TAKE THAT NUMBER

14:04.999 --> 14:06.999
FROM $45,000-PLUS

14:06.999 --> 14:07.999
TO $45,000-NEGATIVE.

14:07.999 --> 14:12.999
WHAT I'M REALLY BUYING INTO IS

14:07.999 --> 14:12.999
THE POTENTIAL OF WHAT'S THERE.

14:12.999 --> 14:13.999
SO, MY VISION, REALLY,

14:13.999 --> 14:16.999
IS TO HAVE IT FEEL LIKE

14:13.999 --> 14:16.999
A REAL DESTINATION.

14:16.999 --> 14:20.999
PEOPLE IN THE DINING ROOM, THEY

14:16.999 --> 14:20.999
COME FROM A DECENT DISTANCE --

14:20.999 --> 14:22.999
30, 40, 50 MILES.

14:22.999 --> 14:26.999
AND THE BETTER THE DESTINATION,

14:22.999 --> 14:26.999
THE FURTHER THEY'LL COME FROM.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.999
I WANT TO BUILD A GENERAL STORE,

14:29.999 --> 14:33.999
PUTTING PRODUCTS IN THAT GENERAL

14:29.999 --> 14:33.999
STORE THAT ARE WITHIN OUR SCOPE.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.999
AND SO, I'M WILLING TO PUT UP

14:35.999 --> 14:38.999
A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

14:35.999 --> 14:38.999
INTO THE BUSINESS.

14:38.999 --> 14:40.999
AND WE'LL USE

14:38.999 --> 14:40.999
THAT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

14:40.999 --> 14:44.999
TO HAVE WORKING CAPITAL,

14:40.999 --> 14:44.999
TO BUILD OUT THE GENERAL STORE,

14:44.999 --> 14:46.999
TO BUILD A DECK ALONG THE BACK

14:46.999 --> 14:48.999
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE

14:46.999 --> 14:48.999
OVERFLOW SEATING.

14:48.999 --> 14:52.999
BUT THE PROPERTY

14:48.999 --> 14:52.999
THAT THIS BUILDING SITS ON

14:52.999 --> 14:55.999
HAS TO BE INSIDE THE BUSINESS

14:55.999 --> 14:58.999
BECAUSE MAKING AN INVESTMENT

14:55.999 --> 14:58.999
IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS,

14:58.999 --> 14:59.999
AS YOU GUYS KNOW IS --

14:59.999 --> 15:02.999
-Lynn: IT'S RISKY.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.999
-Lemonis: IT'S RISKY.

15:02.999 --> 15:04.999
AND SO, I'M GONNA WANT 40%

15:02.999 --> 15:04.999
OF THE BUSINESS.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.999
IN ADDITION TO THAT,

15:07.999 --> 15:09.999
I WANT THE DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS

15:07.999 --> 15:09.999
FOR THE BISCUITS.

15:09.999 --> 15:13.999
I REALLY WANT TO TAKE THEM

15:09.999 --> 15:13.999
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

15:13.999 --> 15:17.999
I WANT TO GET THAT THING IN

15:13.999 --> 15:17.999
AS MANY GROCERY STORES AS I CAN,

15:17.999 --> 15:19.999
AS FAST AS I CAN

15:19.999 --> 15:23.999
'CAUSE I THINK THE BISCUIT

15:19.999 --> 15:23.999
IS ACTUALLY THE MONEY-MAKER.

15:23.999 --> 15:26.999
THE PROFITS WOULD WORK

15:23.999 --> 15:26.999
THE SAME AS OUR OTHER DEAL,

15:26.999 --> 15:28.999
YOU HAVE 60%, I HAVE 40%.

15:28.999 --> 15:29.999
I JUST WANT TO CONTROL

15:28.999 --> 15:29.999
THE PROCESS...

15:30.000 --> 15:31.999
Lynn: I'M SORRY.

15:31.999 --> 15:32.999
Lemonis: ...100%.

15:35.999 --> 15:39.999
I'M GONNA HELP YOU ULTIMATELY

15:35.999 --> 15:39.999
LEAVE SOMETHING FOR SHULER.

15:39.999 --> 15:43.999
Ewell: YOU HAD A NUMBER IN YOUR

15:39.999 --> 15:43.999
HEAD WHERE YOU WANTED TO BE.

15:43.999 --> 15:45.999
Norton: WE HONESTLY HAD TALKED

15:43.999 --> 15:45.999
ABOUT ON THE PERCENTAGES

15:46.000 --> 15:49.999
AS 35% BEING KIND OF A PLACE

15:46.000 --> 15:49.999
WE'D LIKE TO STOP.

15:49.999 --> 15:52.999
Lemonis: MY FIRST OFFER

15:49.999 --> 15:52.999
IS ALWAYS MY BEST OFFER.

15:52.999 --> 15:53.999
Norton:

15:52.999 --> 15:53.999
I'VE READ THAT ABOUT YOU.

15:53.999 --> 15:56.999
CAN I HAVE ABOUT TWO MINUTES

15:53.999 --> 15:56.999
WITH HER OUTSIDE THE DOOR,

15:56.999 --> 15:58.999
-JUST A SECOND?

15:56.999 --> 15:58.999
-Lemonis: OKAY.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.999
Norton: [ GRUNTS ]

16:00.999 --> 16:02.999
MY KNEE GOT STIFF.

16:03.999 --> 16:07.999
Ewell:

16:03.999 --> 16:07.999
YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG LEAP FOR

16:03.999 --> 16:07.999
MY WIFE AND I TO COME BACK HERE.

16:07.999 --> 16:09.999
I CAN'T COME BACK TILL

16:07.999 --> 16:09.999
IT JUST MAKES SENSE

16:07.999 --> 16:09.999
FOR US. IT'S GOT TO.

16:09.999 --> 16:12.000
WE KNOW WHERE OUR SALARIES

16:09.999 --> 16:12.000
ARE TOGETHER.

16:12.999 --> 16:13.999
Lemonis: AND HOW MUCH IS THAT?

16:13.999 --> 16:14.999
Ewell: IT'S OVER $200,000.

16:14.999 --> 16:15.999
Lemonis: WAIT A SECOND.

16:15.999 --> 16:16.999
A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

16:16.999 --> 16:18.999
EWELL TOLD ME THAT HE WAS

16:16.999 --> 16:18.999
WILLING TO BE A PARTNER.

16:18.999 --> 16:22.999
BUT NOW HE'S ASKING FOR A SALARY

16:18.999 --> 16:22.999
OF $200,000?

16:22.999 --> 16:23.999
DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

16:29.999 --> 16:33.999
Ewell:

16:29.999 --> 16:33.999
YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG LEAP FOR

16:29.999 --> 16:33.999
MY WIFE AND I TO COME BACK HERE.

16:33.999 --> 16:35.999
WE KNOW WHERE OUR SALARIES

16:33.999 --> 16:35.999
ARE TOGETHER.

16:35.999 --> 16:37.999
-Lemonis: AND HOW MUCH IS THAT?

16:35.999 --> 16:37.999
-Ewell: IT'S OVER $200,000.

16:37.999 --> 16:40.999
Norton: IT'S ALWAYS HARD GIVING

16:37.999 --> 16:40.999
UP A PERCENTAGE

16:40.999 --> 16:41.999
OF SOMETHING YOU BUILT.

16:53.999 --> 16:54.999
-ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO FOR IT.

16:53.999 --> 16:54.999
-Lemonis: ALL RIGHT.

16:57.999 --> 16:59.999
-YOU GOT A DEAL.

16:57.999 --> 16:59.999
-Norton: YOU GOT A DEAL.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
Lemonis: MY $500,000 OFFER

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
IS GONNA GO TOWARDS PAYING OFF

17:01.999 --> 17:04.999
THE $86,000 MORTGAGE

17:01.999 --> 17:04.999
THAT EXISTS.

17:04.999 --> 17:08.999
THE REMAINING $414,000

17:04.999 --> 17:08.999
IS GONNA GO DIRECTLY TOWARDS

17:08.999 --> 17:10.999
THE EXPANSION OF THE FACILITY,

17:08.999 --> 17:10.999
ENHANCING THE AMOUNT OF SEATING

17:10.999 --> 17:13.999
BY BUILDING A DECK,

17:10.999 --> 17:13.999
AND A GENERAL STORE.

17:13.999 --> 17:15.999
Lynn: I'M RELIEVED

17:13.999 --> 17:15.999
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

17:15.999 --> 17:18.999
NOW WE CAN REALLY TAKE

17:15.999 --> 17:18.999
THIS PLACE AND GO WITH IT.

17:18.999 --> 17:20.000
Lemonis: YOU WORKED HARD FOR IT.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.999
BOTH OF YOU DID,

17:20.999 --> 17:22.999
WORKED HARD FOR IT.

17:22.999 --> 17:23.999
I SAY IT'S TIME TO GET TO WORK.

17:22.999 --> 17:23.999
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

17:23.999 --> 17:25.999
-Lynn: I THINK SO, TOO.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.999
-Norton: ALL RIGHT.

17:26.999 --> 17:27.999
Lemonis: WELL, HI, FOLKS.

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
I WANTED TO GET EVERYBODY

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
TOGETHER.

17:29.999 --> 17:31.999
NORTON AND LYNN AND I MADE A

17:29.999 --> 17:31.999
DEAL FOR ME TO BECOME A PARTNER

17:31.999 --> 17:33.999
IN SHULER'S BAR-B-QUE.

17:33.999 --> 17:35.999
I WROTE A CHECK FOR $500,000.

17:35.999 --> 17:39.999
THAT $500,000 WILL GIVE ME 40%

17:35.999 --> 17:39.999
OF THE BUSINESS.

17:39.999 --> 17:42.999
LYNN AND NORTON WILL STILL OWN

17:39.999 --> 17:42.999
60% OF THE BUSINESS.

17:42.999 --> 17:45.999
WHEN I INVEST IN A BUSINESS,

17:42.999 --> 17:45.999
I LOOK FOR THREE THINGS --

17:45.999 --> 17:47.999
PEOPLE, PROCESS, AND PRODUCT.

17:47.999 --> 17:51.000
IN THIS PARTICULAR BUSINESS,

17:47.999 --> 17:51.000
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE PEOPLE.

17:51.999 --> 17:52.999
I LOVE THE PRODUCT.

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD

17:52.999 --> 17:54.999
BETTER BARBECUE EVER.

17:54.999 --> 17:57.999
BUT WHAT I DON'T LOVE

17:54.999 --> 17:57.999
IS THE PROCESS.

17:57.999 --> 18:00.999
MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK

17:57.999 --> 18:00.999
THAT THE OBVIOUS SOLUTIONS

18:00.999 --> 18:03.999
TO SHULER'S MAKING MORE MONEY

18:00.999 --> 18:03.999
WOULD BE TO OPEN UP ANOTHER DAY.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
BUT I'M NOT WILLING TO DO THAT

18:03.999 --> 18:05.999
UNTIL I KNOW

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
THAT THE THREE DAYS THAT

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
WE'RE OPERATING ARE PERFECT.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.999
I WANT TO IMPROVE

18:07.999 --> 18:10.999
HIGH FOOD COSTS,

18:10.999 --> 18:12.999
NOT PROCESSING THE CUSTOMERS

18:10.999 --> 18:12.999
QUICK ENOUGH,

18:12.999 --> 18:14.999
NOT HAVING THE SEATING BE RIGHT.

18:14.999 --> 18:15.999
I WANT TO ADD A MANAGER

18:15.999 --> 18:17.999
TO LESSEN THE BURDEN

18:15.999 --> 18:17.999
ON LYNN AND NORTON.

18:17.999 --> 18:22.999
WHEN WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS,

18:17.999 --> 18:22.999
I'M 100% IN CHARGE.

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
Norton: I'D LIKE TO THANK

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
ALL OF Y'ALL FOR WHAT YOU DO.

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
IT IS BECAUSE OF Y'ALL

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
THAT WE GET WHERE WE ARE.

18:26.999 --> 18:29.999
Lemonis:

18:26.999 --> 18:29.999
LET'S BRING IT ALL IN THE

18:26.999 --> 18:29.999
MIDDLE, SOUTH CAROLINA STYLE.

18:29.999 --> 18:31.999
All: ONE, TWO, THREE, SHULER'S!

18:31.999 --> 18:33.999
Lemonis: LET'S GO TO WORK!

18:33.999 --> 18:36.999
[ APPLAUSE ]

18:39.999 --> 18:40.999
THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS

18:40.999 --> 18:43.000
IS UNDERSTANDING

18:40.999 --> 18:43.000
WHAT SHULER'S FOOD COSTS

18:43.999 --> 18:44.999
ACTUALLY ARE RIGHT NOW.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.999
I WANT TO LOWER THE FOOD COSTS

18:44.999 --> 18:47.999
TO IMPROVE MARGINS.

18:47.999 --> 18:49.999
WE'RE GONNA BUILD A PLATE,

18:47.999 --> 18:49.999
WE'RE GONNA GET A SCALE...

18:49.999 --> 18:50.999
Lynn: OKAY. OKAY.

18:50.999 --> 18:51.999
Lemonis: ...AND WE'RE GONNA

18:50.999 --> 18:51.999
FIGURE IT OUT.

18:55.999 --> 18:57.999
Norton: THAT'S A WOMAN'S PLATE.

18:57.999 --> 18:58.999
[ LAUGHS ]

18:58.999 --> 19:00.999
Lemonis: ALL RIGHT.

18:58.999 --> 19:00.999
LET'S START CALCULATING IT.

19:00.999 --> 19:01.999
SO, TWO PIECES OF CHICKEN.

19:01.999 --> 19:03.999
Norton: ABOUT 37 CENTS APIECE,

19:01.999 --> 19:03.999
NOT COUNTING FRYING.

19:03.999 --> 19:05.999
Lemonis: SO, 40 CENTS APIECE.

19:05.999 --> 19:06.999
SO, THAT'S 80 CENTS.

19:06.999 --> 19:08.999
30 CENTS FOR THE CORN.

19:08.999 --> 19:10.999
Lynn:

19:08.999 --> 19:10.999
BISCUITS ARE 6 CENTS APIECE.

19:10.999 --> 19:12.999
Lemonis: OKAY.

19:10.999 --> 19:12.999
SO, THAT'S 12 CENTS.

19:12.999 --> 19:14.999
83 CENTS FOR THE BARBECUE.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999
$1.50 FOR THE VEGETABLES.

19:16.999 --> 19:19.999
-10 CENTS FOR THE TEA.

19:16.999 --> 19:19.999
-Norton: OKAY.

19:19.999 --> 19:20.999
Lemonis:

19:19.999 --> 19:20.999
75 CENTS FOR THE DESSERTS.

19:20.999 --> 19:22.999
-WHAT'S THAT EQUAL?

19:20.999 --> 19:22.999
-Norton: $4.40.

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
Lemonis: $4.40. HOW MANY TIMES

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
WILL PEOPLE GO BACK?

19:24.999 --> 19:25.999
Norton:

19:24.999 --> 19:25.999
AVERAGE IS ONE AND A HALF.

19:25.999 --> 19:26.999
Lynn: YEAH.

19:26.999 --> 19:27.999
Lemonis: EVEN IF I TOOK ONE

19:26.999 --> 19:27.999
AND A QUARTER,

19:27.999 --> 19:31.999
SO $5.50 IS WHAT IT COSTS US

19:31.999 --> 19:34.999
FOR SOMEBODY TO COME

19:31.999 --> 19:34.999
THROUGH HERE ON LUNCH.

19:34.999 --> 19:35.999
HOW MUCH DO YOU CHARGE FOR THIS?

19:35.999 --> 19:36.999
-$8.95 FOR LUNCH?

19:35.999 --> 19:36.999
-Norton: $8.95.

19:36.999 --> 19:39.999
Lemonis: SO, YOUR FOOD COSTS

19:36.999 --> 19:39.999
ARE ACTUALLY CLOSER TO 61%.

19:39.999 --> 19:42.999
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT

19:39.999 --> 19:42.999
DINNER'S EVEN WORSE

19:42.999 --> 19:45.999
BECAUSE THEY EAT MORE DESSERT,

19:42.999 --> 19:45.999
THERE'S RIBS.

19:45.999 --> 19:47.999
Ewell:

19:45.999 --> 19:47.999
I'VE HAD CONCERNS FOR AWHILE.

19:47.999 --> 19:50.999
SO, WE'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT THESE

19:47.999 --> 19:50.999
FOOD COSTS ARE SO WE CAN --

19:50.999 --> 19:51.999
Lemonis: IS THIS SOMETHING

19:50.999 --> 19:51.999
YOU'VE TALKED TO NORTON ABOUT?

19:51.999 --> 19:53.999
Ewell: WE HAVE.

19:53.999 --> 19:54.999
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO DO

19:53.999 --> 19:54.999
THE PROMOTIONS AND MARKETING,

19:54.999 --> 19:56.999
HELP THEM.

19:56.999 --> 19:58.999
I CAN PUT TOGETHER

19:56.999 --> 19:58.999
A REAL MARKETING BUDGET.

19:58.999 --> 20:01.999
Lemonis: NO, LET'S STAY ON THIS.

19:58.999 --> 20:01.999
LET'S STAY ON THIS.

20:01.999 --> 20:04.999
WE KNOW THE FOOD COSTS WERE 60%.

20:01.999 --> 20:04.999
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE?

20:04.999 --> 20:07.999
Ewell: I'D SAY FOOD COSTS

20:04.999 --> 20:07.999
SHOULD BE 20% TO 30%.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.999
Norton: 40% IS ABOUT THE LOWEST

20:07.999 --> 20:09.999
YOU EVER FIND FROM A RESTAURANT

20:09.999 --> 20:11.999
IF YOU TALK TO RESTAURATEURS.

20:11.999 --> 20:12.999
Lemonis:

20:11.999 --> 20:12.999
EVEN IF HE'S RIGHT AT 40%...

20:12.999 --> 20:14.999
-Ewell: YEAH.

20:12.999 --> 20:14.999
-Lemonis: OKAY?

20:14.999 --> 20:20.999
...20% ON $1 MILLION

20:14.999 --> 20:20.999
IS $200,000 IN PROFIT...

20:20.999 --> 20:22.999
THAT'S JUST GONE.

20:22.999 --> 20:25.999
IF SHULER'S FOOD COSTS ARE 61%,

20:22.999 --> 20:25.999
THEN WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

20:25.999 --> 20:30.999
I WANT TO RAISE THE PRICE OF AN

20:25.999 --> 20:30.999
ADULT DINNER TO $15 FROM $13.95.

20:30.999 --> 20:32.999
THAT'S AN INCREASE OF $1.05.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.999
AND IF WE'RE OPEN THREE NIGHTS

20:32.999 --> 20:34.999
A WEEK,

20:34.999 --> 20:37.999
THAT'S $1,575 PER WEEK

20:37.999 --> 20:42.999
OR $75,600 IN ADDITIONAL

20:37.999 --> 20:42.999
GROSS REVENUE PER YEAR.

20:42.999 --> 20:44.999
BUT THAT'S ONLY HALF

20:42.999 --> 20:44.999
THE PROBLEM.

20:44.999 --> 20:47.999
WE ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH

20:44.999 --> 20:47.999
THE COST OF THE ACTUAL FOOD.

20:47.999 --> 20:51.999
YOU NEED ONE PERSON IN THIS

20:47.999 --> 20:51.999
BUSINESS MANAGING FOOD COSTS.

20:51.999 --> 20:52.999
WHAT DO YOU THINK, EWELL?

20:52.999 --> 20:54.999
Ewell: I SPOKE TO A COUPLE CHEFS

20:54.999 --> 20:57.999
WHO ARE CONSULTANTS TO COME IN

20:54.999 --> 20:57.999
AND DO THIS KIND OF THINGS.

20:57.999 --> 21:00.999
AND THEY -- $1,000 A DAY, $1,200

20:57.999 --> 21:00.999
A DAY FOR THEM TO CONSULT.

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
Lemonis:

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
WE DON'T NEED A CONSULTANT.

21:02.999 --> 21:03.999
NONE OF US ARE CONSULTANTS.

21:03.999 --> 21:05.999
WE'RE SITTING HERE WITH A SCALE

21:03.999 --> 21:05.999
IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTAURANT

21:05.999 --> 21:06.999
AND WE FIGURED IT OUT.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
Ewell: I KNOW. I KNOW.

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
Lemonis:

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
WE NEED SOMEBODY THAT HAS A

21:08.999 --> 21:10.999
VESTED INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS,

21:10.999 --> 21:13.999
THAT WANTS TO SEE IT SUCCEED,

21:10.999 --> 21:13.999
THAT GETS THE MARGINS RIGHT,

21:13.999 --> 21:16.999
AND THAT'S KEEPING YOU GUYS

21:13.999 --> 21:16.999
ON POINT.

21:16.999 --> 21:17.999
I KNOW THAT LYNN AND NORTON

21:17.999 --> 21:19.999
WANT EWELL TO BE PART

21:17.999 --> 21:19.999
OF THIS BUSINESS.

21:19.999 --> 21:22.999
AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE GIVEN HIM

21:19.999 --> 21:22.999
PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES.

21:22.999 --> 21:23.999
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM DO

21:22.999 --> 21:23.999
A THING

21:23.999 --> 21:26.000
EXCEPT TALK ABOUT

21:23.999 --> 21:26.000
MARKETING STRATEGIES.

21:29.999 --> 21:31.999
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND

21:29.999 --> 21:31.999
WHAT EWELL DOES

21:31.999 --> 21:34.999
AND WHAT HE WANTS TO DO,

21:31.999 --> 21:34.999
AND IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME.

21:34.999 --> 21:37.999
HE TOLD ME THAT THEIR COMBINED

21:34.999 --> 21:37.999
INCOME BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE

21:37.999 --> 21:39.999
IS LIKE 200 GRAND.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.999
DO YOU SEE YOURSELF GIVING AWAY

21:39.999 --> 21:42.999
$200,000?

21:42.999 --> 21:44.999
Norton: NO. WELL, IT'S LYNN.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.999
SHE WANTS HER SISTER UP HERE

21:44.999 --> 21:46.999
SO BAD.

21:46.999 --> 21:47.999
I HAVE TO BE VERY, VERY TOUCHY

21:46.999 --> 21:47.999
WITH THAT

21:47.999 --> 21:49.999
'CAUSE SHE LOVES HER FAMILY.

21:49.999 --> 21:50.999
AND NOTHING MAKES ME HAPPIER

21:50.999 --> 21:51.999
THAN TO SEE HER SMILE

21:50.999 --> 21:51.999
AND BE HAPPY.

21:51.999 --> 21:56.999
BUT I DON'T SEE ANY WAY

21:51.999 --> 21:56.999
THAT WE CAN JUST BRING HIM IN.

21:56.999 --> 21:57.999
Lemonis: DOES SHE KNOW

21:56.999 --> 21:57.999
THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY?

21:57.999 --> 21:58.999
Norton: NO.

21:58.999 --> 22:00.999
Lemonis:

21:58.999 --> 22:00.999
THAT'S DANGEROUS TERRITORY.

22:00.999 --> 22:02.999
Norton: IT IS. VERY.

22:02.999 --> 22:04.999
Lemonis: ONCE YOU MAKE THAT

22:02.999 --> 22:04.999
COMMITMENT AND THEY MOVE HERE,

22:04.999 --> 22:06.999
-THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

22:04.999 --> 22:06.999
-Norton: YEAH.

22:06.999 --> 22:08.999
Lemonis: ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

22:06.999 --> 22:08.999
WITH MIXING FAMILY AND BUSINESS

22:08.999 --> 22:09.999
IS THAT OFTENTIMES,

22:09.999 --> 22:12.999
THE OWNER FEELS OBLIGATED

22:09.999 --> 22:12.999
TO HIRE A FAMILY MEMBER,

22:12.999 --> 22:14.999
EVEN IF IT'S NOT A GOOD FIT.

22:16.999 --> 22:17.999
-LYNN, THIS IS KENNY.

22:16.999 --> 22:17.999
-Lynn: HI, KENNY.

22:17.999 --> 22:18.999
Kenny: HEY, LYNN.

22:17.999 --> 22:18.999
SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

22:18.999 --> 22:20.999
Lynn: NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

22:20.999 --> 22:23.999
Lemonis:

22:20.999 --> 22:23.999
KENNY AND I, WE OWN A LARGE

22:20.999 --> 22:23.999
COMMERCIAL BAKERY IN CHICAGO,

22:23.999 --> 22:26.999
AND HE'S BEEN DOING THIS

22:23.999 --> 22:26.999
FOR ALMOST -- GOSH, ALMOST --

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
-Kenny: 22.

22:26.999 --> 22:28.999
-Lemonis: 22 YEARS.

22:28.999 --> 22:29.999
Lemonis: MAKES STUFF

22:28.999 --> 22:29.999
FOR WHOLE FOODS AND COSTCO.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.999
Kenny: MARCUS SHARED WITH ME

22:30.000 --> 22:32.999
YOUR FORMULA AND YOUR PROCESS,

22:32.999 --> 22:33.999
AND I LOVE IT,

22:32.999 --> 22:33.999
AND I'VE HAD THE BISCUITS.

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
THE KIDS HAVE HAD THEM.

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
THEY THINK THEY'RE GREAT.

22:35.999 --> 22:38.999
I'VE HEARD RAVE REVIEWS ABOUT

22:35.999 --> 22:38.999
THE WATERMELON CAKE, ALSO.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.999
Lemonis:

22:39.000 --> 22:40.999
I JUST WANTED HIM TO COME DOWN

22:39.000 --> 22:40.999
AND SPEND SOME TIME WITH YOU.

22:40.999 --> 22:41.999
Lynn: OKAY. THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.999
Lemonis: ANY TIME YOU

22:42.000 --> 22:44.999
MASS PRODUCE A PRODUCT,

22:44.999 --> 22:45.999
YOU HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
NOT ONLY FOR THE SIZE

22:45.999 --> 22:47.999
OF THE BATCH,

22:47.999 --> 22:49.999
BUT THE AMOUNT OF SHELF LIFE

22:47.999 --> 22:49.999
THE PRODUCT WILL HAVE.

22:49.999 --> 22:51.999
Kenny:

22:49.999 --> 22:51.999
IN THE RESTAURANT HERE,

22:51.999 --> 22:53.999
ARE THEY GENERALLY NOT

22:51.999 --> 22:53.999
UNIFORM SHAPE?

22:53.999 --> 22:55.999
-Lynn: RIGHT.

22:53.999 --> 22:55.999
-Kenny: WHICH IS OKAY.

22:55.999 --> 22:56.999
Lemonis:

22:55.999 --> 22:56.999
WELL, HERE'S A BAG OF THEM.

22:56.999 --> 22:57.999
AND, SEE, THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT.

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
Kenny: BECAUSE, CERTAINLY,

22:57.999 --> 22:59.999
WHEN WE GO TO COMMERCIALIZATION,

22:59.999 --> 23:01.999
ONE OF THE KEYS

22:59.999 --> 23:01.999
IS THAT IT'S CONSISTENT

23:01.999 --> 23:03.999
SIZE, SHAPE, AND WEIGHT

23:01.999 --> 23:03.999
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.999
SO THEY FIT IN THE PACKAGES,

23:04.000 --> 23:07.999
SO THE NUTRITIONAL DATA MATCHES.

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
I'LL WALK YOU THROUGH

23:07.999 --> 23:09.999
WHAT WE DID.

23:09.999 --> 23:12.999
INSTEAD OF SELF-RISING,

23:09.999 --> 23:12.999
WE USED ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR.

23:13.999 --> 23:17.999
WE FIND COMMERCIALLY IS THAT

23:13.999 --> 23:17.999
EVERYBODY'S SELF-RISING

23:13.999 --> 23:17.999
FLOUR IS DIFFERENT.

23:17.999 --> 23:20.999
ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR GENERALLY

23:17.999 --> 23:20.999
HAS A STANDARD OF IDENTITY.

23:21.999 --> 23:24.999
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE

23:21.999 --> 23:24.999
USE SHORTENING.

23:24.999 --> 23:26.999
WE'RE GONNA GO WITH BUTTER

23:24.999 --> 23:26.999
THIS TIME.

23:26.999 --> 23:27.999
Lynn: NO. NO, NO, NO.

23:27.999 --> 23:29.999
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT LUMPY.

23:29.999 --> 23:31.999
Kenny: THERE'S DEFINITELY BEEN A

23:29.999 --> 23:31.999
MOVE AWAY FROM EATING SHORTENING

23:31.999 --> 23:33.999
FOR HEART HEALTH.

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
Lemonis: ONE THING PEOPLE WILL

23:33.999 --> 23:35.999
LOOK AT ON THE BACK OF A BAG

23:35.999 --> 23:36.999
IS THE INGREDIENTS, RIGHT?

23:36.999 --> 23:39.999
I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE

23:36.999 --> 23:39.999
SHORTENING.

23:39.999 --> 23:43.999
IT FEELS ARTIFICIAL TO ME.

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
Lynn: I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT

23:43.999 --> 23:45.999
THE CUSTOMERS HERE.

23:45.999 --> 23:46.999
THEY'RE USED TO MY BISCUITS.

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
WHEN YOU START ADDING

23:46.999 --> 23:48.999
SOMETHING DIFFERENT,

23:48.999 --> 23:51.999
AND YOU'RE USED TO MY RECIPE...

23:51.999 --> 23:54.999
Lemonis: I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED

23:51.999 --> 23:54.999
THAT LYNN'S PUSHING BACK

23:54.999 --> 23:55.999
ON WHAT KENNY'S SUGGESTING.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.999
THE ONLY THING WE WANT TO DO

23:55.999 --> 23:58.999
IS MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS

23:58.999 --> 24:00.999
SO THE BISCUIT CAN BE

23:58.999 --> 24:00.999
MASS-PRODUCED.

24:02.999 --> 24:03.999
Lynn: THIS IS CRAZY.

24:03.999 --> 24:05.999
YOU KNOW, IT IS A FAMILY RECIPE.

24:05.999 --> 24:08.999
I'M TRYING TO ADJUST,

24:05.999 --> 24:08.999
BUT THIS IS NOT US.

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
Kenny: MY GRANDFATHER

24:09.999 --> 24:11.999
USED TO ALWAYS SAY TO ME,

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
"IF YOU'RE NOT CHANGING,

24:11.999 --> 24:13.999
YOU'RE STUCK.

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
AND IF YOU'RE STUCK,

24:13.999 --> 24:15.999
YOU'RE NOT GOING FORWARD."

24:19.999 --> 24:20.999
Ewell: YOU NEED TO OPEN

24:19.999 --> 24:20.999
YOUR EYES A LITTLE BIT.

24:20.999 --> 24:22.999
Lemonis: I NEED TO OPEN MY EYES?

24:22.999 --> 24:24.999
HAVE YOU WORKED THE REGISTER

24:22.999 --> 24:24.999
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE?

24:24.999 --> 24:26.999
HAVE YOU WORKED IN THE KITCHEN

24:24.999 --> 24:26.999
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE?

24:26.999 --> 24:27.999
I'M OPEN. WHAT AM I MISSING?

24:32.999 --> 24:33.999
Lemonis: I'VE LEARNED

24:32.999 --> 24:33.999
YOUR FACIAL EXPRESSIONS.

24:33.999 --> 24:35.999
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

24:36.999 --> 24:39.999
Lynn: YEAH.

24:39.999 --> 24:41.999
OKAY.

24:41.999 --> 24:43.999
Lemonis: I CAN TELL FROM

24:41.999 --> 24:43.999
THE TONE IN YOUR VOICE

24:43.999 --> 24:45.999
HOW YOU'RE REALLY FEELING,

24:43.999 --> 24:45.999
SO JUST TELL ME.

24:45.999 --> 24:47.999
Lynn: WE KNEW THAT

24:45.999 --> 24:47.999
THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY

24:47.999 --> 24:50.999
THAT IT WAS GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE

24:47.999 --> 24:50.999
TO MASS PRODUCE IT.

24:50.999 --> 24:51.999
WE DEAL WITH THAT EVERY DAY.

24:51.999 --> 24:52.999
WE SEE A RECIPE, WE TRY IT,

24:52.999 --> 24:54.999
AND THERE'S GOT TO BE

24:52.999 --> 24:54.999
SOME CHANGE

24:54.999 --> 24:57.999
TO GO FROM FEEDING 6 PEOPLE

24:54.999 --> 24:57.999
TO FEEDING 1,000 PEOPLE.

24:57.999 --> 24:59.999
THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.999
SO, I'M TAKING THE STEP BACK,

24:59.999 --> 25:02.999
AND I'M LOOKING AT IT.

25:02.999 --> 25:03.999
AND I WANT TO SEE

25:02.999 --> 25:03.999
HOW IT TURNS OUT.

25:03.999 --> 25:06.999
AND THEN WE'LL GO WITH IT.

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
-Lemonis: IS THIS DONE?

25:07.999 --> 25:08.999
-Kenny: THESE ARE DONE.

25:09.999 --> 25:12.999
Lemonis: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

25:12.999 --> 25:14.999
Lynn: I THINK I LIKE MINE

25:12.999 --> 25:14.999
A LITTLE BIT SWEETER.

25:14.999 --> 25:15.999
Lemonis: SO, WE CAN ADD

25:14.999 --> 25:15.999
A LITTLE MORE SUGAR TO IT?

25:15.999 --> 25:16.999
Kenny: CORRECT. EXACTLY.

25:16.999 --> 25:19.999
Lemonis: THE BONES

25:16.999 --> 25:19.999
OF YOUR BISCUIT ARE FANTASTIC.

25:19.999 --> 25:21.000
SO, I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO

25:21.999 --> 25:22.999
IS CONTINUE TO WORK ON

25:21.999 --> 25:22.999
THE RECIPE

25:22.999 --> 25:24.999
AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING

25:22.999 --> 25:24.999
THAT WORKS FOR BOTH.

25:24.999 --> 25:25.999
Lynn: OKAY.

25:25.999 --> 25:27.999
Lemonis: I'M HAPPY TO SEE

25:25.999 --> 25:27.999
THAT LYNN SEES THE VALUE

25:27.999 --> 25:28.999
IN ALL THESE CHANGES

25:27.999 --> 25:28.999
WE'RE MAKING.

25:28.999 --> 25:29.999
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.999
IT'S GONNA MAKE BOTH OF US

25:30.000 --> 25:31.999
A LOT OF MONEY.

25:39.999 --> 25:42.999
SINCE WE ALREADY FIXED

25:39.999 --> 25:42.999
HALF OF THE EQUATION

25:42.999 --> 25:44.999
BY RAISING THE PRICE OF DINNER,

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
I NOW WANT TO TACKLE

25:44.999 --> 25:46.999
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE --

25:46.999 --> 25:47.999
THE COST OF MEAT.

25:47.999 --> 25:51.999
NORTON HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN

25:47.999 --> 25:51.999
DEALING WITH NATIONAL SUPPLIERS.

25:51.999 --> 25:53.999
AND I WANT TO GET OUT

25:51.999 --> 25:53.999
AND RESEARCH OUR ABILITY

25:53.999 --> 25:55.999
TO BUY MEAT LOCALLY

25:53.999 --> 25:55.999
AT A BETTER PRICE.

25:55.999 --> 25:56.999
I'M MARCUS.

25:56.999 --> 25:57.999
THIS IS MY PARTNER NORTON.

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
DO YOU HAVE ANY FRESH PIG

25:57.999 --> 25:59.999
THAT WE COULD SEE?

25:59.999 --> 26:00.999
DON'T GET TOO EXCITED.

26:03.999 --> 26:04.999
SO, WHAT PART DO WE LIKE?

26:04.999 --> 26:05.999
Norton: WE LIKE RIBS.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.999
Lemonis: HOW MUCH DO WE USE

26:05.999 --> 26:07.999
A YEAR IN RIBS?

26:07.999 --> 26:09.999
-Norton: 25,000 POUNDS.

26:07.999 --> 26:09.999
-Lemonis: 25,000 POUNDS A YEAR.

26:09.999 --> 26:10.999
Norton: THAT'S A LOT.

26:10.999 --> 26:12.999
Lemonis: AND WHAT DO WE PAY

26:10.999 --> 26:12.999
A POUND TODAY?

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
Norton: $3.89, $3.98,

26:12.999 --> 26:14.999
IN THAT RANGE.

26:14.999 --> 26:16.000
Lemonis:

26:14.999 --> 26:16.000
BUT YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT

26:16.999 --> 26:17.999
IF WE BUY THAT MUCH FROM YOU,

26:16.999 --> 26:17.999
RIGHT?

26:20.999 --> 26:23.999
I MEAN, IF WE'RE BUYING IT

26:20.999 --> 26:23.999
25,000 POUNDS A YEAR,

26:23.999 --> 26:26.999
I'M THINKING THAT NUMBER NEEDS

26:23.999 --> 26:26.999
TO BE MUCH LOWER.

26:27.999 --> 26:28.999
-$2.65 A POUND?

26:27.999 --> 26:28.999
-Tom: MM-HMM.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.999
-FOR THE RIBS?

26:29.000 --> 26:30.999
-Tom: MM-HMM.

26:30.999 --> 26:34.999
Lemonis: SHULER'S CURRENTLY BUYS

26:30.999 --> 26:34.999
25,000 POUNDS OF RIBS PER YEAR

26:34.999 --> 26:36.999
AT $3.89 PER POUND.

26:36.999 --> 26:39.999
WE JUST NEGOTIATED A RATE

26:36.999 --> 26:39.999
OF $2.65 PER POUND

26:39.999 --> 26:43.999
FOR AN ANNUAL SAVINGS

26:39.999 --> 26:43.999
OF $31,000.

26:43.999 --> 26:45.999
THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

26:43.999 --> 26:45.999
FOR NORTON

26:45.999 --> 26:47.999
TO CONSTANTLY BE MONITORING

26:45.999 --> 26:47.999
HIS FOOD PRICES.

26:47.999 --> 26:50.999
IN A MATTER OF HOURS, WE SAVED

26:47.999 --> 26:50.999
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

26:55.999 --> 26:56.999
ONE OF THE THINGS

26:55.999 --> 26:56.999
THAT EXCITES ME ABOUT SHULER'S

26:56.999 --> 26:59.999
IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

26:56.999 --> 26:59.999
COME THERE ON A GIVEN NIGHT.

26:59.999 --> 27:02.999
BUT WHAT FRUSTRATES ME

26:59.999 --> 27:02.999
IS HOW SLOW THE LINE MOVES.

27:02.999 --> 27:04.999
TODAY THEY ONLY HAVE

27:02.999 --> 27:04.999
ONE REGISTER.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.000
I CALL IT A TOLL BOOTH.

27:06.999 --> 27:08.999
IF WE ADD ANOTHER REGISTER

27:06.999 --> 27:08.999
AND WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO EAT

27:09.000 --> 27:11.999
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BUFFET,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.999
OPENING UP ANOTHER LANE,

27:11.999 --> 27:14.999
I BELIEVE WE COULD

27:11.999 --> 27:14.999
DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE SPEED

27:14.999 --> 27:16.999
AT WHICH PEOPLE STAND IN LINE.

27:16.999 --> 27:17.999
SINCE WE PLAN ON

27:16.999 --> 27:17.999
MOVING CUSTOMERS

27:17.999 --> 27:18.999
THROUGH THE LINE FASTER,

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
WE'LL ALSO NEED TO EXPAND

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
OUR SEATING

27:21.000 --> 27:22.999
SO THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THEM.

27:22.999 --> 27:24.999
-HOW ARE YOU, SIR? I'M MARCUS.

27:22.999 --> 27:24.999
-Ben: BEN HAYES.

27:24.999 --> 27:26.999
Lemonis:

27:24.999 --> 27:26.999
SO, YOU BUILT THIS BUILDING?

27:26.999 --> 27:27.999
Ben: YES, SIR.

27:27.999 --> 27:28.999
-Lemonis: YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

27:27.999 --> 27:28.999
-Ben: THANK YOU.

27:28.999 --> 27:31.999
Lemonis: I KNOW IF

27:28.999 --> 27:31.999
WE COULD SPEND ABOUT $100,000

27:31.999 --> 27:33.999
TO EXPAND THE DECK

27:31.999 --> 27:33.999
AND ADD 100 SEATS,

27:33.999 --> 27:35.999
WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET

27:33.999 --> 27:35.999
OUR MONEY BACK PRETTY QUICKLY.

27:35.999 --> 27:37.999
Norton: PEOPLE LOVE SITTING

27:35.999 --> 27:37.999
OVER THE WATER.

27:37.999 --> 27:38.999
-Lemonis: YEAH.

27:37.999 --> 27:38.999
-Norton: PEOPLE LOVE WATER.

27:38.999 --> 27:40.999
Lemonis: IF TABLES, ON AVERAGE,

27:38.999 --> 27:40.999
TURN TWO TIMES A NIGHT,

27:40.999 --> 27:43.999
THEN I KNOW I CAN TAKE THEIR

27:40.999 --> 27:43.999
AVERAGE CUSTOMERS PER NIGHT

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
FROM 500 TO 700.

27:45.999 --> 27:48.999
CONSERVATIVELY, IF THE DECK'S

27:45.999 --> 27:48.999
ONLY OPEN 100 NIGHTS PER YEAR,

27:48.999 --> 27:50.999
AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $15,

27:50.999 --> 27:54.999
THAT'S $300,000 ADDITIONAL

27:50.999 --> 27:54.999
GROSS REVENUE PER YEAR.

27:54.999 --> 27:55.999
THAT'S A LOT.

27:55.999 --> 27:58.999
Man: THIS IS 5,000 SQUARE FEET.

27:58.999 --> 27:59.999
Lemonis:

27:58.999 --> 27:59.999
NOW THAT THE DECK IS UNDERWAY,

27:59.999 --> 28:00.999
I WANT TO MEET WITH AN ARCHITECT

28:01.000 --> 28:02.999
TO DESIGN THE PLANS

28:01.000 --> 28:02.999
FOR THE GENERAL STORE.

28:02.999 --> 28:06.999
AND THEN I WAS ENVISIONING THE

28:02.999 --> 28:06.999
BAKERY HALF DRYWALL, HALF GLASS.

28:06.999 --> 28:08.999
SO, LIKE, YOU KNOW

28:06.999 --> 28:08.999
WHEN YOU GO TO AN AQUARIUM?

28:08.999 --> 28:09.999
Lynn: THAT'S GREAT.

28:09.999 --> 28:11.999
Lemonis: THANK YOU, SIR,

28:09.999 --> 28:11.999
VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE IT.

28:12.999 --> 28:14.999
Lemonis:

28:12.999 --> 28:14.999
EWELL TEXTED ME THIS MORNING

28:14.999 --> 28:18.999
AND TOLD ME THAT HE WANTED TO

28:14.999 --> 28:18.999
DISCUSS HIS ROLE IN THE COMPANY.

28:18.999 --> 28:20.999
NOW, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM

28:18.999 --> 28:20.999
GET INVOLVED

28:20.999 --> 28:21.999
IN ANYTHING RELATED TO

28:20.999 --> 28:21.999
THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS,

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
SO I'M CURIOUS

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
AT WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

28:24.999 --> 28:26.999
Ewell:

28:24.999 --> 28:26.999
WELL, I WAS JUST GONNA GO OVER

28:24.999 --> 28:26.999
HOW THIS ALL MIGHT WORK FOR ME.

28:26.999 --> 28:28.999
Lemonis: YOU MEAN

28:26.999 --> 28:28.999
ABOUT YOUR ROLE HERE?

28:28.999 --> 28:30.999
-Ewell: YEAH.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.999
-Lemonis: JUST TALK TO ME.

28:30.999 --> 28:32.999
I DON'T THINK IT'S A BAD THING

28:30.999 --> 28:32.999
THAT YOU WANT TO BE INVOLVED.

28:32.999 --> 28:33.999
Ewell: [ Chuckling ] OKAY.

28:33.999 --> 28:36.999
Lemonis: THE ONLY THING THAT

28:33.999 --> 28:36.999
I'M KIND OF THINKING ABOUT IS,

28:36.999 --> 28:38.999
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WAITING FOR

28:36.999 --> 28:38.999
ME TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO DO.

28:38.999 --> 28:39.999
Ewell: NO, NO. NO. NO, NO.

28:39.999 --> 28:42.999

40:21.999 --> 40:24.000
Norton: THIS IS THE COOL THING.

40:24.999 --> 40:25.999
THAT IS COOL.

40:25.999 --> 40:26.999
Lynn:

40:25.999 --> 40:26.999
I NEVER WOULD HAVE DREAMED.

40:26.999 --> 40:27.999
NEVER WOULD HAVE DREAMED THIS.

40:27.999 --> 40:29.999
NEVER.

40:29.999 --> 40:31.999
MMM.

40:31.999 --> 40:32.999
THAT'S GOOD.

40:32.999 --> 40:33.999
Shuler: PRETTY GOOD.

40:33.999 --> 40:35.999
Lemonis:

40:33.999 --> 40:35.999
AND THIS IS YOUR MOM'S RECIPE.

40:35.999 --> 40:36.999
WE DIDN'T CHANGE A THING.

40:36.999 --> 40:41.999
SO, THESE CUPCAKES WILL BE

40:36.999 --> 40:41.999
IN ALL 26 STORES.

40:41.999 --> 40:43.999
THE BISCUITS

40:41.999 --> 40:43.999
WILL NOT ONLY BE HERE,

40:43.999 --> 40:45.999
BUT THEY'LL BE IN GROCERY STORES

40:43.999 --> 40:45.999
LIKE THE PACKAGING I SHOWED YOU,

40:45.999 --> 40:46.999
SO IT WILL BE EVERYWHERE.

40:46.999 --> 40:49.999
IT'S ABOUT DRIVING PEOPLE BACK

40:46.999 --> 40:49.999
TO LATTA, SOUTH CAROLINA...

40:49.999 --> 40:51.999
Lynn: AND EAT

40:49.999 --> 40:51.999
AT SHULER'S BAR-B-QUE.

40:51.999 --> 40:55.999
Lemonis: ...TO THE BEST BARBECUE

40:51.999 --> 40:55.999
PLACE WITH THE BIGGEST FLAG.

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
HOW'S IT FEEL?

40:56.999 --> 40:57.999
Lynn: TO BE IN NEW YORK

40:57.999 --> 41:02.999
AND SEE THE WATERMELON CUPCAKES

40:57.999 --> 41:02.999
AND THE BISCUITS, IT'S MY MOM'S.

41:02.999 --> 41:04.999
THAT'S WHAT'S EXCITING.

41:04.999 --> 41:07.999
AND I CAN'T WAIT

41:04.999 --> 41:07.999
TILL SHE FINDS OUT.

41:07.999 --> 41:08.999
Norton: THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT

41:07.999 --> 41:08.999
RIGHT THERE.

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
Lynn: [ CHUCKLES ]

41:09.999 --> 41:10.999
Norton: SHE'S HAPPY, I'M HAPPY.

41:10.999 --> 41:11.999
Lemonis:

41:10.999 --> 41:11.999
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

41:11.999 --> 41:12.999
Lynn: THANK YOU, MARCUS.

41:12.999 --> 41:14.999
Lemonis:

41:12.999 --> 41:14.999
I WAS ALWAYS VERY FOCUSED

41:14.999 --> 41:17.999
AT NOT MESSING WITH THE CHARM

41:14.999 --> 41:17.999
OF THE SHULER'S LOCATION.

41:17.999 --> 41:19.999
BUT I DO LIKE THE FACT THAT

41:17.999 --> 41:19.999
I COULD TAKE A PIECE OF SHULER'S

41:19.999 --> 41:21.999
AND SPREAD IT

41:19.999 --> 41:21.999
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

41:28.999 --> 41:32.999
WHEN I FIRST WENT TO SHULER'S,

41:28.999 --> 41:32.999
I SAW LINES OUT THE DOOR.

41:32.999 --> 41:36.999
A GREAT PRODUCT WITH GREAT

41:32.999 --> 41:36.999
DEMAND BUT SMALL PROFITS.

41:36.999 --> 41:37.999
THE GOOD NEWS

41:36.999 --> 41:37.999
ABOUT THIS BUSINESS

41:37.999 --> 41:39.999
IS THAT THE STORY'S BEEN GREAT.

41:39.999 --> 41:41.999
BUT IT'S NOT OVER.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.999
WE'RE BREAKING GROUND

41:41.999 --> 41:43.999
ON A BRAND-NEW BUILDING

41:43.999 --> 41:45.999
THAT'LL HAVE A GENERAL STORE

41:45.999 --> 41:47.999
AND AN EXPANDED BAKE SHOP

41:45.999 --> 41:47.999
FOR LYNN.

41:47.999 --> 41:50.999
THAT SHOULD GET DONE

41:47.999 --> 41:50.999
IN THE NEXT SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS.

41:50.999 --> 41:54.999
WHILE I FIXED THE FLOW UP FRONT

41:50.999 --> 41:54.999
AND I ADDED ANOTHER REGISTER,

41:54.999 --> 41:56.999
CUSTOMERS ARE MOVING

41:54.999 --> 41:56.999
THROUGH THE LINE MUCH FASTER.

41:56.999 --> 41:59.999
AND MORE CUSTOMERS THROUGH

41:56.999 --> 41:59.999
THE LINE MEANS MORE MONEY.

41:59.999 --> 42:02.999
I KNOW THE ADDITIONAL SEATING

41:59.999 --> 42:02.999
ON THE DECK

42:02.999 --> 42:04.999
WILL PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT

42:02.999 --> 42:04.999
INCREASE TO OUR REVENUE.

42:04.999 --> 42:06.999
AND DOING THIS TO LEAVE

42:04.999 --> 42:06.999
SOMETHING SUSTAINABLE

42:06.999 --> 42:08.999
FOR LITTLE SHULER TO TAKE OVER

42:06.999 --> 42:08.999
ONE DAY

42:08.999 --> 42:10.999
HAS A SPECIAL MEANING TO ME.

42:10.999 --> 42:11.999
YOU WERE VERY COMFORTABLE

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
WITH A STRANGER

42:11.999 --> 42:13.999
COMING INTO YOUR BUSINESS

42:13.999 --> 42:15.999
AND SUGGESTING

42:13.999 --> 42:15.999
AND FORCING CHANGES.

42:15.999 --> 42:18.999
Norton: IT AMAZES ME

42:15.999 --> 42:18.999
WHAT WE HAVE BUILT,

42:18.999 --> 42:21.999
AND IT OVERWHELMS ME

42:18.999 --> 42:21.999
TO REALIZE WHERE WE'RE GOING.

42:21.999 --> 42:24.999
Lemonis: THIS IS A PLACE

42:21.999 --> 42:24.999
THAT I CAN COME AND BE MYSELF

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
AND BE WITH PEOPLE THAT I ENJOY

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
AND I TRUST

42:26.999 --> 42:28.999
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE I'M PART

42:26.999 --> 42:28.999
OF YOUR FAMILY.

42:28.999 --> 42:31.999
Lynn: AND WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU

42:28.999 --> 42:31.999
IN THE FAMILY.

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
Norton: YOU'RE PART OF

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
THE FAMILY. YOU GOT TO

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
GO WITH US AND HAVE FUN.

42:33.999 --> 42:36.999
Lemonis:

42:33.999 --> 42:36.999
I NOW BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEST

42:33.999 --> 42:36.999
BARBECUE IN THE UNITED STATES.

42:36.999 --> 42:38.999
-Lynn: OH, GREAT. THANK YOU.

42:36.999 --> 42:38.999
-Norton: IT IS.

42:38.999 --> 42:39.999
Lynn: [ CHUCKLES ] IT IS.
