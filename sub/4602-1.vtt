WEBVTT

01:11.936 --> 01:13.130
Hey, Brennan.

01:14.572 --> 01:17.473
Mom, I'm watching the thing
with the lady.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.542
I'm leaving. Okay?
I'll be home around 11.

01:19.710 --> 01:22.304
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Brennan.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.712
<i>Let's slowly get those hips up.
Good. Now, hold it right here. Great.</i>

01:32.223 --> 01:33.411
Dale.

01:33.591 --> 01:35.559
Dale, I'm leaving for the conference.

01:35.726 --> 01:39.162
- You leave me money for pizza, Dad?
- Yeah, there's $20 on the hall table.

01:39.330 --> 01:41.560
Do not order pay-per-view, buddy.

01:41.732 --> 01:44.394
- But what if I want wings?
- You don't need wings.

01:44.569 --> 01:45.934
That's not enough, Dad!

01:46.103 --> 01:47.695
The RTI cochlear implant...

01:47.872 --> 01:50.432
...is the state-of-the-art
implantable hearing device...

01:50.608 --> 01:54.840
...due to its input processing of sound
via the speech processor.

01:55.012 --> 01:57.776
But the most exciting
new development...

01:57.949 --> 01:59.439
...is the external processor...

01:59.617 --> 02:01.847
...which fits directly over the ear...

02:02.019 --> 02:06.149
...which eliminates the need to put
your face between those breasts.

02:08.826 --> 02:13.263
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm so lost.
And this never happens to me.

02:15.766 --> 02:18.860
My name is Robert, and I play
racquetball. I collect coins.

02:19.036 --> 02:20.765
Sweet Jesus! I love Korean food.

02:20.938 --> 02:23.771
I am Nancy Huff. I know
how to make tandoori chicken...

02:23.941 --> 02:26.034
...I contribute to NPR
every single year...

02:26.210 --> 02:28.201
...and I love the movies
of Rob Reiner.

02:28.379 --> 02:30.438
Pilates changed my life.

02:30.615 --> 02:33.778
I have a boat, and I wanna retire
and sail around the world.

02:34.452 --> 02:36.579
- I love the sea!
- And I drive a Mercedes...

02:36.754 --> 02:39.655
...and I have a 40-year-old son, Dale,
who still lives at home.

02:39.991 --> 02:42.983
- What did you just say?
- I knew I shouldn't have told you that.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.025
I have a 39-year-old son
named Brennan...

02:45.196 --> 02:47.756
...who still lives at home with me.

02:57.842 --> 03:00.310
I would like to thank all of you...

03:00.478 --> 03:04.710
...for being here with us
on this fantastic, wonderful day.

03:04.882 --> 03:08.045
And I would like to raise my glass.

03:08.219 --> 03:12.155
Dale and I wanna welcome you
to our home with open arms.

03:14.158 --> 03:16.991
- Get a room, Dad.
- Oh, for chri... Dale!

03:17.928 --> 03:21.694
Well, as you all know, my youngest
son, Derek, couldn't be here...

03:21.866 --> 03:24.164
...because of an important
fishing trip.

03:24.335 --> 03:29.671
But my other son, Brennan, was going
to be moving into his own place...

03:29.840 --> 03:32.934
...but he was recently let go
from his job at PetSmart...

03:33.110 --> 03:36.910
...so he is gonna be living with us.

03:37.081 --> 03:40.244
I wasn't fired from my job,
I was laid off!

03:40.418 --> 03:42.511
But you wouldn't
know the difference.

03:42.853 --> 03:47.256
I didn't want salmon!
I said it four times.

03:50.461 --> 03:52.361
This wedding is horseshit.

03:56.801 --> 03:59.702
Somebody's awfully quiet
back there.

04:00.738 --> 04:02.899
I'm not gonna call him Dad.

04:03.407 --> 04:05.204
Brennan, you're 39 years old.

04:05.376 --> 04:07.401
I would not expect you
to call him Dad.

04:07.578 --> 04:12.208
Well, I'm not going to, ever.
Even if there's a fire.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.912
Robert better not get in my face...

04:16.554 --> 04:18.749
...because I'll drop
that motherfucker.

04:18.923 --> 04:20.254
Jesus, Brennan.

04:20.558 --> 04:24.619
I'm just saying, I think
you gotta think about your options.

04:24.795 --> 04:27.662
I know that you are
technically married now...

04:27.832 --> 04:31.495
...but that does not mean
that they have to live here.

04:32.269 --> 04:36.865
Dale, I think it's time for a change
for both of us.

04:37.942 --> 04:40.740
Dad, we're men, okay?

04:40.911 --> 04:43.436
That means a few things.

04:43.614 --> 04:47.243
We like to shit with the door open.
We talk about pussy.

04:47.418 --> 04:50.819
We go on riverboat-gambling trips.
We make our own beef jerky.

04:50.988 --> 04:54.287
That's what we do.
And now that is all wrecked.

04:55.192 --> 04:58.093
We literally have never done
any of those things.

04:58.262 --> 05:00.492
Where did he go to medical school?

05:00.765 --> 05:03.199
He went to Northwestern
and Johns Hopkins.

05:03.367 --> 05:06.768
- Is that good enough for you?
- No, it's not.

05:07.004 --> 05:10.770
Well, Brennan, those are
very prestigious schools.

05:11.308 --> 05:13.708
I smoked pot with Johnny Hopkins.

05:13.878 --> 05:16.472
You don't know anyone
named Johnny Hopkins.

05:16.647 --> 05:19.582
It was Johnny Hopkins
and Sloan Kettering...

05:19.750 --> 05:22.583
...and they were
blazing that shit up every day.

05:22.753 --> 05:26.154
All right, here's a scenario
for you, Dad.

05:26.323 --> 05:28.655
Suppose Nancy sees me
coming out of the shower...

05:28.826 --> 05:31.727
...and decides to come on to me.
I'm looking good.

05:31.896 --> 05:34.091
I've got a luscious V of hair...

05:34.265 --> 05:37.632
...going from my chest pubes
down to my ball-fro.

05:37.802 --> 05:40.566
And she takes one look at me,
and she goes:

05:40.738 --> 05:42.171
"Oh, my God.

05:42.339 --> 05:46.469
I've had the old bull,
now I want the young calf."

05:46.644 --> 05:50.239
- And she grabs me by the wiener.
- Shut the fuck up!

06:02.860 --> 06:05.158
- Come on, Brennan.
- I'm fine here.

06:07.731 --> 06:09.995
- There you are.
- Hi.

06:10.167 --> 06:13.034
Oh, you look so cute
in your moving clothes.

06:13.204 --> 06:14.865
- How was it?
- It was easy.

06:15.039 --> 06:16.870
The movers did everything.

06:20.211 --> 06:21.337
Where's Brennan?

06:22.546 --> 06:24.741
He's still in the car.

06:24.915 --> 06:26.405
It was kind of a rough drive.

06:26.584 --> 06:28.711
Hey, Robert,
what's all the commotion?

06:28.886 --> 06:31.582
- Hey, Don.
- Is that your wife, Nancy?

06:31.755 --> 06:34.155
- Right here, Don.
- Can I come over this afternoon...

06:34.325 --> 06:36.225
...and touch your face?
- Sure.

06:36.393 --> 06:37.553
Thanks. Good luck, guys.

06:37.728 --> 06:38.820
We'll see you, Don.

06:38.996 --> 06:41.794
Let's go, Cinnamon.
Heel, Cinnamon.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.725
Heel! Cinnamon!

06:46.837 --> 06:47.861
Cinnamon!

06:48.439 --> 06:49.633
Hi, Dale.

06:49.807 --> 06:52.537
Hey, Nancy. Could you make me
a grilled-cheese sandwich?

06:52.710 --> 06:54.200
- Sure.
- No.

06:54.378 --> 06:57.575
Dale just ate. He's testing you to see
how much he can get away with.

06:57.748 --> 06:59.477
- I see.
- I'm hungry.

06:59.650 --> 07:01.208
Look in your right hand.

07:01.385 --> 07:03.751
- I sure don't mind a bit. I really don't.
- No, no.

07:03.921 --> 07:06.048
No, no. He's fine.

07:30.281 --> 07:31.373
Hey.

07:32.082 --> 07:33.174
Hey.

07:33.684 --> 07:34.946
I'm Brennan.

07:35.452 --> 07:36.817
I'm Dale.

07:37.321 --> 07:39.289
But you have to call me Dragon.

07:40.758 --> 07:42.988
You have to call me Nighthawk.

08:03.314 --> 08:04.338
Brennan.

08:06.684 --> 08:07.844
Please don't do that.

08:15.659 --> 08:18.719
Now, that's enough ketchup.
Come on. Dale.

08:20.197 --> 08:21.960
- I like it.
- That's enough.

08:22.199 --> 08:24.258
Dale, I don't know if you...

08:24.735 --> 08:29.365
You might wanna try this. I make
a sauce, we call it "fancy sauce"...

08:29.773 --> 08:30.967
For me.

08:31.141 --> 08:34.838
- that Brennan really likes
with his chicken nuggets.

08:35.012 --> 08:36.274
It's my fancy sauce.

08:36.447 --> 08:41.646
Well, when Brennan finishes,
I'll give you some of this, and it's...

08:41.819 --> 08:45.084
It's ketchup and mayonnaise
mixed together, so...

08:45.255 --> 08:47.052
It's so good.

08:47.224 --> 08:49.089
- I want some fancy sauce.
- Yeah.

08:49.259 --> 08:51.284
- I'm not done using it.
- Looks good.

08:51.462 --> 08:54.295
- Can I have fancy sauce?
- Of course. Of course.

08:54.465 --> 08:56.057
- I'm using it right now.
- Okay.

08:56.700 --> 08:59.464
- So let's just let him try some.
- You wanna try it, Dale?

08:59.636 --> 09:01.900
Yeah, I really would like some.

09:02.139 --> 09:03.436
Just one last spoonful.

09:04.641 --> 09:07.075
Hey, I think you've got
enough there, Brennan.

09:07.511 --> 09:09.376
- So here you go.
- Thanks.

09:09.546 --> 09:10.911
It's ketchup and mayonnaise.

09:13.183 --> 09:15.174
- I don't like it. It smells weird.
- Okay.

09:15.352 --> 09:16.751
- I'll try some.
- You want some?

09:16.920 --> 09:18.182
- Sure. Absolutely.
- Okay.

09:18.522 --> 09:21.013
You don't mind, do you, Brennan?
No. Okay.

09:23.427 --> 09:25.088
- Brennan...
- I'm not comfortable...

09:25.262 --> 09:27.457
It's okay. It's probably
not good on fish anyway.

09:27.631 --> 09:30.532
My dad's king of the castle, so if he
wants fancy sauce, he should...

09:30.701 --> 09:33.261
- No, it's all right, Dale.
- He can make his own batch.

09:33.437 --> 09:34.631
So you know what?

09:34.805 --> 09:39.708
Today, when you were driving around,
Dale was telling me that he's really...

09:39.877 --> 09:44.280
...into kung fu, and I was telling him
that you're really into kung fu as well.

09:46.350 --> 09:48.341
I have a green belt.

09:49.086 --> 09:50.212
Read it and weep.

09:50.454 --> 09:52.285
I don't believe in belts.

09:52.556 --> 09:54.854
There should be no
ranking system for toughness.

09:55.059 --> 09:58.324
But one time I wrestled a giraffe
to the ground with my bare hands.

09:58.495 --> 10:00.588
That's not true, Dale.
Don't be ridiculous.

10:02.533 --> 10:05.434
So, Dale, what have you been
working on recently?

10:05.702 --> 10:06.930
Well...

10:08.138 --> 10:09.901
...I manage a baseball team.

10:10.874 --> 10:14.037
- Little League?
- Fantasy league.

10:22.419 --> 10:24.284
Take a picture. It'll last longer.

10:24.455 --> 10:27.424
Why don't you stop
being so confrontational, Dale?

10:27.591 --> 10:29.218
I'm not the one staring at me.

10:29.927 --> 10:31.451
So, Brennan, how about you?

10:31.895 --> 10:35.490
I know you used to
work at PetSmart.

10:36.133 --> 10:38.897
- That's right, Mr. Doback.
- Call me Robert.

10:39.570 --> 10:42.471
- That's right, Robin.
- Robert.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.102
Robin.

10:45.242 --> 10:49.542
Actually, Brennan
is a really talented person.

10:49.947 --> 10:51.847
He's a very gifted singer.

10:52.483 --> 10:55.008
- I'm really, really good.
- How good?

10:56.353 --> 10:59.618
I've been called
the songbird of my generation...

10:59.790 --> 11:01.917
...by people who've heard me.

11:02.092 --> 11:03.116
That good.

11:03.293 --> 11:05.693
The only trick is
is that Brennan's very...

11:07.531 --> 11:11.092
...particular about
who he sings in front of, so...

11:11.268 --> 11:14.829
I'm his mom, for example,
I've only heard him sing twice.

11:15.005 --> 11:17.530
That's funny that you say that,
because I can sing too.

11:17.708 --> 11:19.403
In fact, I'll sing right now.

11:19.576 --> 11:22.704
<i>If you wanna get down
On these hairy balls</i>

11:22.880 --> 11:25.212
<i>- Hey!
- Why don't you jump right in?</i>

11:25.382 --> 11:27.213
<i>It's a crotch party right up in here</i>

11:27.384 --> 11:29.579
<i>- Stop it!
- Why don't you lick on this big joint?</i>

11:29.753 --> 11:32.517
Stop it, Dale! Stop it! Stop it!

11:32.689 --> 11:33.781
That's cute.

11:33.957 --> 11:35.948
I remember when I had my first beer.

11:36.126 --> 11:38.458
That's so funny,
the last time I heard that...

11:38.629 --> 11:40.620
...I laughed so hard
I fell off my dinosaur.

11:40.797 --> 11:43.664
Stop right now. All right?
Let's just back off.

11:44.468 --> 11:47.335
All right. Brennan, it's okay.
It's okay.

11:47.804 --> 11:49.203
Hey, hey.

11:49.373 --> 11:51.273
- Great, Dale.
- He said a mean thing first.

11:51.441 --> 11:54.137
All right, just...
Look, you know what...? Hey, guys.

11:54.578 --> 11:57.376
Okay, sleeping arrangements.
It's gonna be different...

11:57.548 --> 12:01.177
...but because Dale refuses
to give up his office drum set...

12:02.352 --> 12:05.719
...that means that, Brennan, you and
Dale are gonna have to share a room.

12:05.889 --> 12:08.858
- But it's just temporary.
- Mom, we didn't talk about this.

12:09.026 --> 12:12.484
Well, it's gonna be
an exciting adventure.

12:12.663 --> 12:16.531
You wanna show him the room, Dale?
Show him where he can put his stuff?

12:17.734 --> 12:21.170
- That's nice, thank you.
- Good night, Nancy.

12:21.872 --> 12:26.104
Hey, listen, I like to have
a lot of fresh fruit around...

12:26.276 --> 12:29.143
...and chocolate chips
in my pancakes. Okay?

12:29.313 --> 12:31.577
- Write it so you don't forget.
- Show him the room.

12:32.015 --> 12:34.347
She's Mom now, so...

12:34.718 --> 12:36.549
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, Brennan.

12:38.055 --> 12:41.320
- Good night, Mr. Doback.
- Good night, Brennan.

12:49.366 --> 12:52.460
So just a few basic rules
about the house.

12:52.636 --> 12:54.536
If there's any foods that you like...

12:54.705 --> 12:58.232
...I suggest you put your name
on them, or they will be thrown out.

12:58.408 --> 12:59.932
By me.

13:00.544 --> 13:03.775
House was built in 1825
by General Custer.

13:03.947 --> 13:06.142
I wanna show you this room.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.411
Hold up.

13:09.253 --> 13:11.118
- You see this room?
- Yeah.

13:11.288 --> 13:13.153
Okay, here's the deal.

13:14.091 --> 13:17.492
This is my office
and my beat laboratory.

13:17.661 --> 13:19.151
Okay?

13:19.329 --> 13:21.388
And this is the one rule of the house:

13:21.565 --> 13:25.160
Don't ever, ever, ever...

13:25.335 --> 13:27.860
...touch my drum set.

13:28.038 --> 13:29.903
- You understand?
- Don't go in there and...

13:30.073 --> 13:32.166
- No touching!
- All right!

13:32.342 --> 13:34.640
There. I was at about six there.

13:34.811 --> 13:36.779
You don't wanna see me go to 10.

13:36.947 --> 13:39.381
Get your shit.
We're going to my room.

13:47.491 --> 13:48.651
Honey?

13:50.027 --> 13:53.258
I just found a chain of islands
that we can sail to after New Zealand.

13:53.430 --> 13:54.863
That's wonderful.

13:56.033 --> 13:59.594
You know,
I've been meaning to ask you...

14:04.141 --> 14:08.077
Why is it that Dale never left?

14:09.780 --> 14:13.045
Well, Dale has always
coasted off my accomplishments.

14:13.216 --> 14:15.241
I mean, he left college
his junior year...

14:15.419 --> 14:18.047
...because he said he wanted
to join the family business.

14:18.388 --> 14:22.290
- But you're a medical doctor.
- Believe me, I've told him that.

14:22.459 --> 14:25.690
But he just always says,
"It's all about who you know."

14:25.862 --> 14:28.296
I don't know where
he got this sense of entitlement.

14:28.565 --> 14:31.659
Maybe it was his mother passing.
What about Brennan?

14:31.835 --> 14:33.302
From what you've told me...

14:33.470 --> 14:35.904
...his younger brother Derek's
been quite successful.

14:36.073 --> 14:39.474
Well, certainly when his father
and I split, that was difficult for him.

14:40.711 --> 14:45.171
And this one time, when Brennan
was 17 and Derek was 14...

14:45.349 --> 14:48.250
...and Brennan decided
to enter a talent show.

14:49.353 --> 14:53.255
<i>He sang a song
from an old pirate musical.</i>

14:53.423 --> 14:58.326
<i>But Derek got his football buddies
to replace the choir and sing:</i>

14:58.495 --> 15:00.395
"Brennan has a mangina."

15:00.564 --> 15:04.022
<i>Brennan has a mangina
Brennan has a mangina</i>

15:04.201 --> 15:10.731
<i>Finally, the audience and even some
of the nastier parents started singing:</i>

15:10.907 --> 15:12.568
"Brennan has a mangina."

15:13.510 --> 15:17.002
<i>And I have to admit, for a little while,
I sort of joined in as well.</i>

15:17.581 --> 15:21.312
<i>From that day on,
Brennan never sang again.</i>

15:21.485 --> 15:25.421
Derek went on to win the contest
by lip-synching "Ice Ice Baby."

15:30.293 --> 15:32.784
- Oh, that's a great song.
- It is.

15:34.131 --> 15:39.626
- Hey, you awake?
- Yeah.

15:42.472 --> 15:47.535
I just want you to know I hate you.
So does my dad.

15:48.845 --> 15:50.938
Well, that's fine.

15:52.282 --> 15:53.943
Because guess what.

15:54.117 --> 15:56.278
I hate you too.

15:56.453 --> 15:59.820
And this house sucks ass.

15:59.990 --> 16:02.083
Well, the only reason
you're living here...

16:02.259 --> 16:05.854
...is because me and my dad decided
that your mom was really hot...

16:06.029 --> 16:08.623
...and maybe we should just
both bang her.

16:08.799 --> 16:11.063
And we'll put up with the retard
in the meantime.

16:11.568 --> 16:14.036
- Who's the retard?
- You.

16:14.304 --> 16:16.966
- Hey, y'all don't say that.
- Shut up.

16:17.340 --> 16:19.240
You'll wake up my dad
and get me grounded.

16:19.876 --> 16:21.309
Just shut up.

16:21.545 --> 16:24.378
You and your mom are hillbillies.

16:24.548 --> 16:29.417
- This is a house of learned doctors.
- You're not a doctor.

16:29.786 --> 16:32.346
You're a big, fat, curly-headed fuck.

16:33.256 --> 16:35.747
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

16:35.926 --> 16:37.917
- I'm a curly-headed fuck?
- Yeah.

16:38.094 --> 16:39.721
You better not go to sleep.

16:40.530 --> 16:43.590
As soon as your eyes shut, I'm gonna
punch you square in the face.

16:43.767 --> 16:46.133
I hope you stay still
when you sleep...

16:46.303 --> 16:49.363
...because I'm putting a rat trap
between your legs.

16:49.539 --> 16:53.805
I'm gonna take a pillowcase
and fill it full of bars of soap...

16:53.977 --> 16:55.444
...and beat the shit out of you.

16:59.282 --> 17:01.773
I want you out of my fucking house.

17:01.952 --> 17:05.012
No way, kemosabe.

17:05.188 --> 17:07.748
This is my house now.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.453
<i>How do you like The Gilded Lady?</i>

17:12.629 --> 17:14.688
I wish we could retire right now.

17:14.865 --> 17:16.799
Won't be long.

17:27.310 --> 17:29.642
Oh, God! It's cold!

17:30.814 --> 17:33.544
Hey! Is anyone listening? Help!

18:19.963 --> 18:22.431
Fuck you, Dale! Fuck you!

18:22.599 --> 18:24.362
<i>- obviously you guys are hot.
You know?</i>

18:24.534 --> 18:27.560
<i>Just revealed her cover.
I was like, "Wow, this is hot."</i>

18:27.737 --> 18:30.706
<i>A little girl-on-girl.
A little heaven, a little hell.</i>

18:33.877 --> 18:35.970
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:38.281 --> 18:41.341
<i>- Why you so sweaty?
- I was watching Cops.</i>

18:41.851 --> 18:43.910
Not supposed to have
your feet on the couch.

19:07.978 --> 19:09.570
Hey, man.

19:10.347 --> 19:11.575
Did you touch my drum set?

19:13.083 --> 19:15.984
- Nope.
- It's just weird...

19:16.987 --> 19:20.616
...because seems like someone
definitely touched my drum set.

19:20.924 --> 19:23.825
Yeah, that is weird.
Because I didn't touch them.

19:24.327 --> 19:27.524
- Hey! Did you touch my drum set?
- Hey, knock it off!

19:27.697 --> 19:31.497
I know you touched my drumstick,
because the left one has a chip in it.

19:32.702 --> 19:34.169
You fucking crazy, man?

19:34.337 --> 19:38.239
You sound insane, do you realize
that? You should be medicated.

19:38.408 --> 19:40.876
Fuck you, Brennan.
I know you touched my drum set.

19:41.044 --> 19:42.807
I wanna hear that
dirty mouth admit it.

19:42.979 --> 19:45.846
You get out of my face,
or I'm gonna roundhouse your ass.

19:46.016 --> 19:48.507
You swear on your mom's life
that you didn't touch it!

19:48.685 --> 19:49.709
I don't swear to shit!

19:49.886 --> 19:52.150
That's because you fucking
touched my drum set...

19:52.322 --> 19:54.347
<i>...because I know
Cops doesn't start till 4.</i>

19:57.394 --> 20:00.557
- Where are you going?
- I'm going upstairs.

20:00.730 --> 20:04.461
Because I'm gonna put my nut sack
on your drum set. Okay?

20:04.634 --> 20:07.865
Don't you do that.
I am warning you right now:

20:08.038 --> 20:12.668
If you touch my drums, I will
stab you in the neck with a knife!

20:13.076 --> 20:17.172
If you even go in the room,
I will go ape-shit, you hear me?

20:17.347 --> 20:18.974
Don't wanna miss a spot.

20:19.349 --> 20:21.374
John Bonham's playing
"Moby Dick" for real!

20:21.551 --> 20:24.076
I swear to God. I swear to God! No!

20:33.496 --> 20:34.690
I warned you.

20:35.031 --> 20:38.159
There's one rule in the house,
and you broke it!

20:48.344 --> 20:49.936
I didn't touch your damn drum set!

20:53.783 --> 20:55.011
I'm pre-diabetic!

21:00.256 --> 21:03.919
You fucking fucker! I'm gonna
rub my balls on your mom's face!

21:05.995 --> 21:07.019
Come back here!

21:12.068 --> 21:15.504
I'll kill you! You son of a bitch!

21:16.272 --> 21:18.035
Your drum set's a whore!

21:18.208 --> 21:20.403
I teabagged your fucking drum set!

21:20.577 --> 21:24.104
Well, my drum set's a guy,
so that makes you gay, you fucker!

21:24.280 --> 21:26.714
I'll kill you!

21:27.550 --> 21:29.415
I think it's gonna go
generic soon, okay?

21:29.586 --> 21:31.816
<i>- Line three.
- Oh, thanks, Miles.</i>

21:31.988 --> 21:33.478
Yeah.

21:34.924 --> 21:37.586
Jules? Wait, what's wrong?

21:39.162 --> 21:43.724
- Back!
- You touched my drum set, you fucker!

21:44.768 --> 21:47.498
Stop it! Stop it!

21:47.670 --> 21:51.071
- Rape! Rape! Rape!
- Stop it! Stop! Stop.

21:51.241 --> 21:53.300
- Stay out of this, Nancy!
- Stop it, you guys.

21:54.177 --> 21:56.202
- Oh, my God, you're hurting him!
- No, Nancy!

21:56.913 --> 21:59.438
Cinnamon! Stop it!

22:00.116 --> 22:03.415
My mom is being eaten by a dog,
there's nothing I can do!

22:03.586 --> 22:05.178
- No, a story has a...
- Excuse me.

22:05.355 --> 22:07.789
Dr. Doback, the phone's for you.
I think it's urgent.

22:07.957 --> 22:08.981
Hello?

22:09.159 --> 22:11.491
<i>Robert, they're like animals!
I can't stop them!</i>

22:11.661 --> 22:14.129
Stop screaming. Please.
I'm on my way.

22:14.297 --> 22:16.458
There seems to be some
savage fight going on...

22:16.633 --> 22:18.828
...between my son and stepson,
so I...

22:20.336 --> 22:21.963
Family issues, huh?

22:22.138 --> 22:24.834
I don't believe in talking about
people's personal lives...

22:25.008 --> 22:26.305
...behind their back.

22:26.709 --> 22:28.609
You know nobody likes you, right?

22:28.778 --> 22:32.612
Rape! Rape! Rape!

22:36.553 --> 22:37.645
What's going on?

22:37.821 --> 22:40.085
Robert! They won't... They won't...

22:40.256 --> 22:42.247
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Dale, what...?

22:42.425 --> 22:44.359
- Stay out of it, Dad!
- Stop it!

22:52.702 --> 22:55.398
What the fucking fuck?

22:59.609 --> 23:01.600
Someone got some air. Snap.

23:02.378 --> 23:03.970
- I still hate you.
- Still hate you.

23:04.714 --> 23:06.204
Such power. It's raw power.

23:06.382 --> 23:08.179
What are you doing?
It's Shark Week.

23:08.351 --> 23:09.477
Okay, here's the deal:

23:09.652 --> 23:13.349
Number one, you will fix
the fucking drywall now.

23:13.523 --> 23:16.856
Number two, you have one month to
find jobs or you're out on your asses.

23:17.026 --> 23:19.722
I will arrange interviews for Monday,
and you will go!

23:19.896 --> 23:23.696
Dad, why are you talking
to me like this? I'm your son.

23:23.867 --> 23:25.391
I'm not buying that crap anymore.

23:25.735 --> 23:29.398
Today I saw my own son
use a bicycle as a weapon.

23:29.572 --> 23:32.302
You yelled "rape"
at the top of your lungs.

23:32.475 --> 23:36.809
Mom, I honestly thought
I was gonna be raped for a second.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.471
He had the craziest look in his eyes.

23:39.649 --> 23:42.140
And at one point he said,
"Let's get it on."

23:42.518 --> 23:45.351
That was about the fighting.
I'm so not a raper.

23:45.521 --> 23:47.318
I didn't touch your drum set, okay?

23:47.490 --> 23:52.621
I witnessed with my eyes
your testicles touching my drum set.

23:52.795 --> 23:55.320
All right, that's it! That's it!

23:55.531 --> 23:57.499
You two guys leave me no choice.

23:57.834 --> 23:59.301
No television for a week.

23:59.535 --> 24:00.559
- What?!
- What?!

24:00.737 --> 24:02.864
- We are so serious, guys.
- You're fucking high!

24:03.039 --> 24:04.267
Are you out of your mind?

24:04.440 --> 24:07.273
This goes in Robert's wall safe
and it's gonna stay there.

24:07.443 --> 24:09.274
- No!
- Okay.

24:09.445 --> 24:13.108
- This house is a fucking prison!
- On planet Bullshit!

24:13.283 --> 24:16.514
In the galaxy of
This Sucks Camel Dicks!

24:46.983 --> 24:50.111
Hi! Aunt Carol. Aunt Carol.

24:51.754 --> 24:55.451
- Hey.
- You can't catch me.

25:00.196 --> 25:01.561
I gotcha.

25:01.731 --> 25:03.255
I gotcha.

25:09.372 --> 25:10.896
Aunt Carol's on fire!

25:28.057 --> 25:29.649
I don't know where you learned it.

25:29.826 --> 25:32.590
- Well, there's lots more where that...
- My God.

25:32.762 --> 25:36.254
- Oh, no. What happened?
- What the...?

25:36.799 --> 25:38.289
Oh, my God.

25:39.035 --> 25:42.527
Maybe Dale left the back door open
and raccoons got in.

25:42.705 --> 25:45.105
Nancy? Is this your purse
in the freezer?

25:45.641 --> 25:48.109
Yes. It's Brennan.

25:48.277 --> 25:51.769
He sleepwalks and he always
puts my purse in the freezer.

25:51.948 --> 25:53.575
Dale sleepwalks too.

25:53.750 --> 25:56.218
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not. Look in the oven.

25:57.620 --> 26:00.487
- What's in the...? Couch pillows?
- Couch pillows.

26:00.656 --> 26:02.123
Yeah, Dale.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.257
Come on.

26:05.795 --> 26:08.286
- It's okay.
- It's really hard.

26:08.464 --> 26:09.658
It's gonna be fine.

26:09.832 --> 26:13.324
They're gonna get jobs,
they'll be gone in a month. A month.

26:20.043 --> 26:21.067
Guys.

26:23.479 --> 26:26.277
- Guys. Guys!
- I'll kill you, Leonard Nimoy.

26:26.449 --> 26:28.474
The clown has no penis.

26:29.185 --> 26:31.176
What kind of dreams
are you guys having?

26:31.354 --> 26:32.946
Hey, it's 12:30.

26:33.122 --> 26:35.852
Brennan, your brother's
coming today, so get up.

26:36.025 --> 26:37.356
- Today?
- Yep.

26:37.527 --> 26:40.826
- Shit.
- What's your problem?

26:40.997 --> 26:43.795
My little brother's even
a bigger asshole than you are.

26:44.367 --> 26:46.835
All right, let's really nail it this time.
Here we go.

26:47.003 --> 26:51.463
A one, a two, a one, two, three, four.

27:10.827 --> 27:14.160
All right, Tommy, you're the oldest.
I'm counting on you. Come on.

27:26.142 --> 27:29.168
Nice vibrato, buddy.
All right, all right, Alice, let's go.

27:31.547 --> 27:33.777
Flat. It's so flat.

27:33.950 --> 27:36.817
I can't even... You don't even
look good while you're singing.

27:36.986 --> 27:38.749
The worst thing I've ever heard.

27:38.921 --> 27:42.049
This is $ 1200 a week for
voice lessons, and this is what I get?

27:42.225 --> 27:43.988
Okay, I'm gonna save it
with this solo.

27:45.561 --> 27:47.495
<i>I'm Derek</i>

27:47.663 --> 27:52.293
<i>And I can sing high like this</i>

27:53.069 --> 27:56.163
<i>And I can sing high</i>

27:59.175 --> 28:00.540
Jesus!

28:15.158 --> 28:18.389
We were so sad you guys
couldn't come to the wedding.

28:18.561 --> 28:20.222
- But we completely understand.
- Yeah.

28:20.396 --> 28:22.296
You were busy fishing
with Mark Cuban.

28:22.465 --> 28:24.456
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well, not just the Cubes...

28:24.634 --> 28:28.001
...but we had Chris Daughtry,
Jeff Probst, super-chef Bobby Flay.

28:28.171 --> 28:30.264
It was insane.
I mean, it was almost too much.

28:30.439 --> 28:31.770
My God, that's impressive.

28:31.941 --> 28:34.273
Yeah, we were down in the Gulf,
fishing bonito.

28:34.443 --> 28:37.412
Robert, have you ever been down
to the Gulf on the bonito run?

28:37.580 --> 28:39.377
Always wanted to.
I hear it's amazing.

28:39.549 --> 28:42.074
- It is. It's gorgeous.
- Are bonito fish big?

28:43.519 --> 28:44.543
What?

28:44.720 --> 28:46.711
Don't interrupt
when he's telling a story.

28:46.889 --> 28:49.380
- It's fine, Robert.
- I was asking about the story.

28:49.559 --> 28:52.551
- What's this guy's deal?
- I don't know, son. It's okay.

28:52.728 --> 28:56.323
Well, Dale, they are
what's called a trophy fish.

28:56.499 --> 29:00.162
So, yeah, they're pretty big.

29:00.503 --> 29:01.800
I'm sorry.

29:04.173 --> 29:05.936
Anyway...

29:06.842 --> 29:09.310
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
I forget where my story was going.

29:09.478 --> 29:10.672
Damn it, Dale.

29:10.846 --> 29:12.074
- No...
- Robert.

29:12.248 --> 29:13.442
- What?
- What? I asked him.

29:13.616 --> 29:16.312
No, he can join in, Robert.
It's really okay.

29:16.485 --> 29:18.350
Well, I asked him twice
not to interrupt.

29:18.521 --> 29:22.321
Gang, don't be mad at Dale for ruining
the story. And possibly the evening.

29:22.491 --> 29:24.618
It's totally fine.
I have a lot more stories.

29:24.794 --> 29:28.093
- Derek, that you do. That you do.
- Yeah.

29:28.264 --> 29:31.859
- Guilty as charged with the stories.
- Oh, God, you're impressive.

29:32.768 --> 29:34.793
Come on. I love talking to you.

29:35.838 --> 29:38.671
From across the room,
I feel like we have a thing.

29:38.841 --> 29:42.937
You and me, man. You're my
new stepdad. You're unbelievable.

29:43.279 --> 29:47.215
- I never heard that laugh before.
- Dad, why are you acting so weird?

29:47.383 --> 29:49.817
Oh, hey, by the way, guys,
where's my bro, Brennan?

29:57.960 --> 30:02.488
You're right about your brother.
Total dick.

30:02.665 --> 30:04.155
Told you.

30:04.333 --> 30:05.925
You know what? I still hate you...

30:06.102 --> 30:08.798
...but you got a pretty awesome
collection of nudie mags.

30:08.971 --> 30:11.496
Yeah, I got them
from the '70s, '80s and '90s.

30:12.508 --> 30:14.976
It's like masturbating
in a time machine.

30:15.344 --> 30:19.178
Anyway, so I figure by the summer
of 2010, we can probably set sail.

30:19.348 --> 30:22.215
But I think about it
every day of my life.

30:22.385 --> 30:24.649
Let me ask you this, Bob,
why wait two years?

30:24.820 --> 30:26.913
- Well, I gotta make more money.
- Okay, look.

30:27.089 --> 30:28.317
I hear you, believe me.

30:28.491 --> 30:31.358
But what if I were to tell you
that I could sell this house...

30:31.527 --> 30:33.256
...for 30 percent above market?

30:33.429 --> 30:36.921
- That'd be great. Could you do it?
- Yeah. In a heartbeat, Robby.

30:37.099 --> 30:40.398
Look, I got my real-estate license
a few years back for shits and gigs.

30:40.569 --> 30:42.230
I'd do it for four-fifths commish...

30:42.405 --> 30:44.669
...because you know what really
gets my dick hard?

30:44.840 --> 30:46.102
Helping out my friends.

30:46.275 --> 30:49.108
That'd be fantastic.
That'd be fanta... Oh, my God.

30:49.278 --> 30:51.610
- No, it would be kick-ass, bro.
- Oh, man.

30:51.781 --> 30:53.408
Right there.

30:55.084 --> 30:56.517
What about Dale and Brennan?

30:56.686 --> 30:58.745
Because they haven't
even gotten jobs yet.

30:58.921 --> 31:01.355
God, change the record.

31:01.691 --> 31:03.318
Sweet!

31:04.860 --> 31:08.125
Robert. Don't talk to me like that
in front of my son.

31:08.297 --> 31:11.630
Oh, come on. We're talking about
our dream, the boat. Come on.

31:11.801 --> 31:15.669
Yeah, it's our dream, but I think it
all needs to be done in good time.

31:15.838 --> 31:19.399
I'm just saying give it some thought,
okay? That's it. That's all I'm saying.

31:19.575 --> 31:22.738
Holy shit, triplets.

31:23.479 --> 31:25.538
It's true, three's company.

31:25.715 --> 31:27.740
- It shows tons of bush.
- Hey, hey, careful.

31:27.917 --> 31:30.044
Careful with that. You're crinkling.

31:30.319 --> 31:33.288
That's a collector's item.
It's worth a lot of money.

31:33.622 --> 31:34.714
What's up, faggots?

31:34.890 --> 31:38.087
What's up, man? What, you're not
gonna come down, say hi to me?

31:38.260 --> 31:39.284
Hi, Derek.

31:39.462 --> 31:42.363
Whoa, calm down, man.
I'm just joking.

31:42.898 --> 31:45.492
You guys, I really like
your guys' setup up here.

31:45.668 --> 31:47.260
What is your problem, man?

31:47.570 --> 31:50.835
My problem? I don't know.
I don't have a problem, Dale.

31:51.006 --> 31:53.236
Actually, I have the opposite
of a problem:

31:53.409 --> 31:55.900
I made over 550 K last year.
How much did you make?

31:56.078 --> 31:58.569
- It's not about money.
- No, it's not about money.

31:58.748 --> 32:00.841
Well, for me,
it's a little bit about money...

32:01.016 --> 32:03.075
...and I made
that much money last year.

32:03.252 --> 32:04.719
I am the VP of the biggest...

32:04.887 --> 32:08.584
...executive-helicopter-leasing
company on the Western Seaboard.

32:08.758 --> 32:11.693
Okay? I haven't had a carb
since 2004.

32:12.695 --> 32:15.163
Check these out. See these?
See these boys?

32:15.331 --> 32:16.662
This is what I live with.

32:16.832 --> 32:19.323
Every day I lather this up
with Kiehl's in the shower.

32:19.502 --> 32:22.164
You wanna touch this shit?
You wanna touch these bad boys?

32:22.938 --> 32:24.530
Sorry, not gonna happen.

32:24.707 --> 32:26.106
Is there something you want?

32:26.275 --> 32:28.038
I promised Mom I'd offer you a job.

32:28.344 --> 32:31.142
I told her it'd count as her
Christmas present, so...

32:31.313 --> 32:33.178
No. I'm never gonna work for you.

32:33.349 --> 32:34.509
Fine. I don't care.

32:34.683 --> 32:38.141
The truth is I just smoked a J
out in my car a few minutes ago...

32:38.320 --> 32:40.254
...so feeling a little spacy.

32:40.423 --> 32:42.482
Know what I'm say...?
What's up with you, man?

32:43.125 --> 32:44.752
What you looking at, kemosabe?

32:44.927 --> 32:46.258
You...

32:46.629 --> 32:48.927
You wanna punch me right now.

32:49.498 --> 32:52.331
You wanna punch me right now,
but you won't.

32:53.169 --> 32:54.397
You wanna punch me too?

32:54.570 --> 32:57.334
You guys both look like you might
wanna hit me in the face.

32:57.506 --> 32:59.633
You do, I can tell.
Well, why don't you do it?

32:59.809 --> 33:01.401
Why don't you punch me
in the face?

33:01.577 --> 33:03.204
Punch me in the fucking face!

33:09.952 --> 33:12.512
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my shoulder!

33:12.688 --> 33:13.916
That was awesome.

33:14.089 --> 33:16.080
Mom! Mom!

33:16.258 --> 33:18.624
Derek, know what's always good
for shoulder pain?

33:18.794 --> 33:21.092
- What?
- If you lick my butthole.

33:21.263 --> 33:23.060
Snap!

33:24.767 --> 33:26.359
- Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Bobby.
- Sure.

33:26.535 --> 33:29.868
Aside from that retard trying to punch
me, it was a pretty good evening.

33:30.039 --> 33:33.440
- It was our pleasure, son.
- Why are you calling him that?

33:33.609 --> 33:34.837
Oh, don't, don't.

33:35.010 --> 33:37.808
Bye, kids. I'll check out that stock
you recommended, Tommy.

33:37.980 --> 33:39.004
Excuse me.

33:39.181 --> 33:42.639
- Hi. I'm Alice, I'm Derek's wife.
- Hi.

33:42.818 --> 33:46.276
Is it true you struck Derek in the face
and he fell from the tree house?

33:46.455 --> 33:47.945
Yeah. He asked me to.

33:48.123 --> 33:50.421
Oh, that's the most amazing thing
I've ever heard.

33:50.593 --> 33:52.185
I want you to know that tonight...

33:52.361 --> 33:55.888
...I am gonna pleasure myself to
the image of you doing that to Derek.

33:56.065 --> 33:57.657
You know what I mean?

33:57.833 --> 33:59.460
Masturbate.

33:59.635 --> 34:01.296
I am.

34:01.470 --> 34:03.131
Oh, Dale.

34:03.305 --> 34:05.239
You are something.

34:05.808 --> 34:08.299
You are something.

34:09.578 --> 34:11.011
You're something too.

34:11.180 --> 34:14.707
I wanna roll you into a little ball
and shove you up my vagina.

34:15.551 --> 34:19.612
You could just live there.
It's warm and it's cozy.

34:19.788 --> 34:20.880
In your vagina?

34:21.056 --> 34:24.492
I wanna walk around with you
in there and just know that...

34:24.660 --> 34:27.151
...whenever I feel a little tickle
or scratch...

34:27.329 --> 34:30.662
...that it's just your hair
up my vagina.

34:30.833 --> 34:32.892
Please, just do it for me.

34:33.168 --> 34:34.567
What's happening?

34:36.739 --> 34:38.536
Kiss me.

34:41.911 --> 34:45.074
I know. I know. It's too much.

34:45.414 --> 34:47.644
It's too much.

34:50.719 --> 34:53.347
I hate my life, Dale.

34:53.756 --> 34:56.987
Dale, I hate my life!
I have nobody to talk to.

34:57.159 --> 34:59.127
- Well, you seemed okay at the di...
- Please.

34:59.295 --> 35:01.195
Alice! Honey, come on!

35:01.463 --> 35:04.990
Dane Cook, pay-per-view,
20 minutes. Let's go!

35:05.167 --> 35:08.534
Coming, honey!
I'm just talking to Dale.

35:08.704 --> 35:11.229
This is so stupid.

35:12.341 --> 35:13.672
Call me.

35:13.842 --> 35:17.073
- I love you.
- Okay.

35:23.218 --> 35:25.686
- Hey. What'd she want?
- What?

35:26.188 --> 35:29.589
Nothing. Who's...? Who?

35:30.593 --> 35:31.617
Alice.

35:31.794 --> 35:35.821
We were just talking. Not...
It was not about sex or anything.

35:36.832 --> 35:39.198
I can't believe you hit Derek.

35:39.368 --> 35:41.996
I know. Did you see
the expression on his face?

35:42.171 --> 35:45.072
- That was cool.
- Listen.

35:45.474 --> 35:48.238
I know that we started out as foe.

35:48.644 --> 35:51.135
But after that courageous act...

35:51.313 --> 35:54.407
...that you showed me
against the one they call Derek...

35:54.984 --> 35:59.318
...maybe someday
we could become friends.

36:00.155 --> 36:03.852
Friends who ride majestic,
translucent steeds...

36:04.026 --> 36:07.189
...shooting flaming arrows
across the Bridge of Hemdale.

36:08.163 --> 36:11.360
I would follow you into the mists
of Avalon, if that's what you mean.

36:11.834 --> 36:14.860
Do you wanna see something cool
that only three people have seen?

36:19.341 --> 36:21.309
Okay, open your eyes.

36:22.911 --> 36:25.038
See that black smudge
right there on the blade?

36:25.214 --> 36:27.011
- Yeah.
- Look at it closely.

36:27.182 --> 36:29.650
- Pretty recognizable signature.
- No.

36:29.818 --> 36:32.252
<i>Randy Jackson from American Idol.</i>

36:32.421 --> 36:35.584
Why do you have Randy Jackson's
autograph on a martial-arts weapon?

36:35.758 --> 36:38.192
I bumped into him
and all I had was this sword...

36:38.360 --> 36:41.124
...and you're not gonna not get
Randy Jackson's autograph.

36:41.530 --> 36:43.691
I would've done
the exact same thing.

36:44.967 --> 36:47.800
Now, do you wanna see
something really cool?

36:47.970 --> 36:50.097
- Of course.
- Turn off the lights.

36:52.374 --> 36:55.901
Industrial-strength
night-vision goggles.

36:56.078 --> 36:57.739
Holy Santa Claus shit.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.971
Can you imagine if we had these
when we were 12?

37:01.150 --> 37:03.414
Even better.
We got them when we're 40.

37:03.886 --> 37:08.050
You know what's amazing? They're
not that noticeable on your face.

37:08.223 --> 37:09.986
- Right?
- Yeah.

37:11.493 --> 37:14.621
I can't believe I've been living here
for two weeks...

37:14.797 --> 37:16.628
...and I'm walking
around this place...

37:16.799 --> 37:19.393
...thinking I've got a huge doucher
for a stepbrother.

37:19.668 --> 37:21.898
Secretly, you're not a doucher.

37:22.438 --> 37:23.905
Let's play a game, all right?

37:24.273 --> 37:26.741
On the count of three,
name your favorite dinosaur.

37:26.909 --> 37:30.310
Don't even think about it, just name it.
Ready? One, two, three.

37:30.479 --> 37:31.969
<i>- Velociraptor.
- Velociraptor.</i>

37:32.514 --> 37:35.642
Favorite non-pornographic magazine
to masturbate to.

37:35.951 --> 37:38.146
<i>- Good Housekeeping.
- Good Housekeeping.</i>

37:38.587 --> 37:41.147
If you were a chick, who's
the one guy you'd sleep with?

37:41.457 --> 37:42.719
- John Stamos.
- John Stamos.

37:43.258 --> 37:45.192
- What?
- Did we just become best friends?

37:45.360 --> 37:46.793
Yep.

37:47.162 --> 37:49.027
Do you wanna go do karate
in the garage?

37:49.198 --> 37:50.631
Yup!

38:10.152 --> 38:11.779
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

38:16.759 --> 38:18.886
I think they're starting to
like each other.

38:19.394 --> 38:21.487
I got a really bad feeling about this.

38:23.132 --> 38:24.622
- Sword fight!
- I know.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.024
Sword fight!

38:30.172 --> 38:33.198
- Exactly the same!
- I know! That's so weird.

38:36.745 --> 38:37.905
Now you're in trouble.

38:40.082 --> 38:41.208
- Come on!
- No!

38:41.383 --> 38:43.681
They're betting against you,
but you can do it!

38:44.953 --> 38:46.318
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

38:48.056 --> 38:49.216
Is this a bad time?

38:49.391 --> 38:50.756
What the hell's going on?

38:50.926 --> 38:53.861
Ma, Mr. Doback, okay,
Dale and I were just...

38:54.029 --> 38:55.826
Please, stop calling me Mr. Doback.

38:55.998 --> 38:57.363
Sorry. Okay.

38:57.533 --> 39:00.127
Mom, Doback...

39:00.702 --> 39:03.034
...we think it would be very prudent...

39:03.205 --> 39:05.673
- Can we turn our beds into bunk beds?
- Yes.

39:06.208 --> 39:07.675
Why are you guys so sweaty?

39:07.843 --> 39:10.744
We've already figured out how.
The beds match up perfectly.

39:10.913 --> 39:14.178
It would give us so much extra space
in our room to do activities.

39:14.349 --> 39:15.373
Please say yes.

39:15.551 --> 39:17.815
You don't need our permission
to build bunk beds.

39:17.986 --> 39:20.216
You're adults.
You can do what you want.

39:20.389 --> 39:22.448
So?

39:23.625 --> 39:25.923
I'm not making myself clear.

39:26.094 --> 39:28.619
I don't give a fuck.

39:28.964 --> 39:31.194
Now, you both have
several interviews tomorrow.

39:31.366 --> 39:34.858
I would think you'd be focused
on that and not building bunk beds.

39:37.072 --> 39:39.632
- So?
- So?

39:39.808 --> 39:44.040
- We can? No?
- Yes. Yes, you can make bunk beds.

39:44.213 --> 39:46.477
- I knew it.
- Okay. You are not gonna regret this.

39:46.648 --> 39:48.445
We'll get so much more
activities done.

39:48.617 --> 39:51.552
This is the funnest night ever!

39:52.788 --> 39:55.086
This is so scary.

39:56.959 --> 39:59.621
- How you doing over there?
- Really good.

40:00.028 --> 40:01.052
Okay.

40:01.296 --> 40:03.287
Does your son know anything
about carpentry?

40:03.465 --> 40:06.025
No, not a th... Did I hear a drill?

40:06.602 --> 40:08.866
- Dale! Dale, no power tools!
- Power tools.

40:09.538 --> 40:11.199
- What?
- No power tools!

40:11.373 --> 40:15.036
- No, I forgot, I have to brush my teeth.
- That is not your toothbrush.

40:15.310 --> 40:17.710
Oh, okay. Well, I'm all done anyway.

40:17.880 --> 40:19.211
- We did it.
- We did it!

40:19.381 --> 40:20.473
It looks amazing!

40:20.649 --> 40:23.709
Look at that! That looks like
what you'd buy from a store!

40:23.886 --> 40:26.548
- Should've been a bunk bed all along.
- Look at this space.

40:26.722 --> 40:29.623
- We could do aerobics in here.
- So many activities!

40:29.825 --> 40:31.816
- Do step class.
- It's making my head spin...

40:31.994 --> 40:34.258
...how many activities we can do.
- Play Army men.

40:34.429 --> 40:35.726
- Yeah.
- Come on.

40:40.702 --> 40:43.170
Hey, I never asked you.
Do you like guacamole?

40:45.240 --> 40:47.606
Oh, Brennan! Oh, God!

40:47.776 --> 40:49.937
Brennan! Brennan!

40:50.512 --> 40:52.673
Dad. Nancy. It's bad.

40:52.881 --> 40:54.974
It's so bad.
There's blood everywhere.

40:55.150 --> 40:58.745
The bunk beds were a terrible idea.
Why'd you let us do that?

40:58.921 --> 41:00.183
It's so bad!

41:00.355 --> 41:01.652
How would you describe that?

41:04.559 --> 41:07.357
- It's not so bad.
- Right. See?

41:09.164 --> 41:10.222
Put your beds back.

41:10.399 --> 41:12.526
Rumpus time is over.

41:12.701 --> 41:15.795
You got a big day tomorrow.
You need your eight hours.

41:18.874 --> 41:22.569
<i>And although she was 88 years old,
she never stopped believing.</i>

41:22.744 --> 41:24.473
<i>It's 8:20 in the a.m.</i>

41:24.646 --> 41:27.479
<i>Coming up next, a recent study
by the American Council...</i>

41:27.649 --> 41:29.640
Look at her. She's hot.

41:30.085 --> 41:34.078
Okay, guys, this is it.
Good luck. Don't be late.

41:34.256 --> 41:36.850
Dad, I need to borrow
some clothes for the interview...

41:37.025 --> 41:38.856
...since I don't have
any fancy clothes.

41:39.027 --> 41:42.292
You go in my closet, take whatever
you need. You guys gotta look sharp.

41:42.464 --> 41:44.455
This is the most important
day of our lives.

41:44.633 --> 41:46.100
- Okay.
- No pressure, no pressure.

41:46.268 --> 41:47.462
- All right? Relax.
- Okay.

41:47.636 --> 41:48.728
I gotta go. I gotta go.

41:48.904 --> 41:50.895
This is your day.
Remember that. You own it.

41:51.073 --> 41:52.938
- This is your one day!
- All right.

41:54.409 --> 41:57.207
Mr. Huff, Mr. Jeener
is ready for your interview.

41:57.379 --> 41:59.540
Actually, we'll be
interviewing as a team.

41:59.715 --> 42:01.945
We're here to fuck shit up.

42:06.588 --> 42:08.215
Move it!

42:16.732 --> 42:18.097
Hey!

42:18.266 --> 42:20.757
Well, Brennan, you certainly
have had a lot of jobs.

42:20.936 --> 42:22.301
I'm a bit of a spark plug.

42:22.471 --> 42:24.962
And, Human Resources lady,
when I think...

42:25.140 --> 42:28.041
- You know, it's... Actually, it's Pam.
- I'm sorry.

42:28.210 --> 42:31.145
- Well, Pan...
- No, my name is Pam.

42:31.313 --> 42:35.409
- Are you saying Pan or Pam?
- I'm saying Pam.

42:35.951 --> 42:38.920
Yeah, I'm sorry, who is this
gentleman sitting behind you?

42:39.087 --> 42:42.022
Hello, Ms. Lady. I'm Dale.
I'm Brennan's stepbrother...

42:42.190 --> 42:45.648
...and I think I might be able to help
with the Pan-Pam dilemma.

42:45.827 --> 42:47.761
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Pam.

42:47.929 --> 42:49.556
- Pan.
- Pam.

42:49.731 --> 42:51.722
- Pand. There's a D on the end.
- With an M.

42:51.900 --> 42:57.429
- There's no D. It's Pam.
- It's like "comb," except P-A-N-M.

42:57.606 --> 43:00.302
- N-N. There's two N's.
- Two M's. That was the confusion.

43:00.475 --> 43:01.806
No, there's just one M.

43:01.977 --> 43:04.002
What do you say we interview you?

43:04.479 --> 43:07.346
All right. Yes, that's a
sometimes-useful exercise.

43:07.516 --> 43:08.915
Please put your hand down.

43:09.251 --> 43:10.275
Go ahead.

43:10.452 --> 43:13.785
How much money do you make
a year before taxes?

43:14.356 --> 43:16.654
Okay, I'm actually not comfortable
answering that.

43:16.825 --> 43:19.419
- Come on!
- We're doing the interview, not you.

43:19.594 --> 43:23.360
Here's a shot out of a cannon:
Oprah, Barbara Walters, your wife.

43:23.532 --> 43:25.762
You gotta fuck one,
marry one, kill one. Go!

43:25.934 --> 43:27.561
I think we're done here. Thank you.

43:27.736 --> 43:31.570
Mr. Huff, under your references,
you listed Dale Doback...

43:31.740 --> 43:34.072
...which I know is this gentleman,
but you also listed...

43:34.242 --> 43:36.267
..."Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior."
- Yeah.

43:36.445 --> 43:39.039
Yeah, we are looking for people
we can contact.

43:39.214 --> 43:41.375
We wanna tell you the stuff
we're not good at.

43:41.583 --> 43:44.177
- Our weaknesses.
- So we're clear up front.

43:44.352 --> 43:47.321
- Okay.
- We're not generally comfortable...

43:47.489 --> 43:50.549
...in an office setting, I would say.
- I get cooped up.

43:50.725 --> 43:53.717
I won't go into an office
that's ever been used before.

43:53.895 --> 43:56.489
I am no good before 11 a.m.

43:56.665 --> 43:59.862
I also get headaches from computers,
so I can't be around them too long.

44:00.068 --> 44:01.433
I take stuff.

44:01.603 --> 44:03.935
I need someone to go up and down
with me in the elevator.

44:04.106 --> 44:07.098
I have a weakness for sweets.

44:07.275 --> 44:08.299
Other weaknesses?

44:08.477 --> 44:11.605
We're slow learners and we're
not particularly good listeners.

44:11.780 --> 44:15.511
- That'll be a huge problem.
- We're also slow learners.

44:15.684 --> 44:17.549
First of all,
I needed someone to work...

44:17.719 --> 44:19.482
Wait, shut your mouth.
Shut your mouth.

44:19.654 --> 44:20.951
I think we've had enough...

44:21.123 --> 44:23.148
- Shush up for one second.
- Shut your mouth.

44:23.558 --> 44:26.254
- Wait, shut your mouth.
- I'm sorry, what did you just say?

44:26.428 --> 44:28.953
- You're just coming off stupid.
- I'm coming off stupid?

44:29.131 --> 44:32.897
You're wearing tuxedos to a job that
requires you to clean bathrooms.

44:33.068 --> 44:36.799
- Please leave this office, we're done.
- Do we get any sort of souvenir?

44:36.972 --> 44:38.564
Get out of my office!

44:38.740 --> 44:42.471
I'm looking to hire guys I don't mind
hanging out with for 12 hours a day.

44:42.644 --> 44:44.111
You guys seem like cool guys.

44:44.279 --> 44:47.248
Got hair similar to mine,
you wear tuxedos to the interview.

44:47.415 --> 44:49.280
That's funny, it's ironic. I get that.

44:49.451 --> 44:53.080
Underplaying the whole formality of it.
I think that's funny as hell.

44:53.255 --> 44:56.122
So let's do this, you know?
You guys are hired. You're in.

44:56.291 --> 44:58.987
Unless you're the weirdest guys ever
and I don't see it.

44:59.161 --> 45:00.651
Great.

45:17.946 --> 45:20.676
- Was that a fart?
- I don't know.

45:20.849 --> 45:22.714
I can taste it.

45:22.951 --> 45:24.009
On my tongue.

45:24.186 --> 45:26.620
Okay, I'll be honest with you.
I did fart.

45:26.988 --> 45:29.821
Is that onion? Onion and...
Onion and ketchup.

45:29.991 --> 45:33.791
- It stinks. And this is a small room.
- Shit.

45:33.962 --> 45:36.328
Okay, now the tuxedos
seem kind of fucked up.

45:37.632 --> 45:41.261
God. We were so close.

45:41.670 --> 45:44.730
So, what do we do for jobs?
Is your dad really gonna kick us out?

45:44.906 --> 45:49.036
Listen, don't worry about my dad.

45:49.377 --> 45:51.868
Got him sewn up.

45:52.314 --> 45:55.215
We've gotta start thinking bigger,
though, Brennan.

45:56.084 --> 45:58.484
Listen, what are you really good at?

45:58.653 --> 46:01.315
Singing. I'm a world-class singer.

46:01.489 --> 46:04.219
See? Right there,
that's an amazing skill.

46:04.392 --> 46:05.825
Now, what am I good at?

46:05.994 --> 46:08.827
I can shred on the drums
and I'm a marketing wiz.

46:08.997 --> 46:10.828
Put all that together,
what do you get?

46:12.334 --> 46:15.326
- I don't know, a band?
- No, that's been done before.

46:15.503 --> 46:20.668
Even better: we are gonna start an
international entertainment company.

46:20.842 --> 46:23.037
The biggest and the best.

46:23.511 --> 46:26.537
And we're gonna call it
Prestige Worldwide.

46:27.082 --> 46:28.515
That sounds so cool.

46:28.883 --> 46:32.944
I feel like a lightning bolt
hit the tip of my penis.

46:33.121 --> 46:35.555
Yeah. Yeah.

46:35.957 --> 46:38.721
We're brothers. This is why we met.

46:38.893 --> 46:40.884
- To form this alliance, right?
- Right?

46:41.062 --> 46:43.553
That's why our parents met,
so this idea could happen.

46:43.732 --> 46:46.530
- Okay, what do we do?
- We get to work.

46:46.701 --> 46:50.034
And we hit the beat laboratory
right now. Let's go.

46:50.205 --> 46:51.763
- What?
- Wait.

46:51.940 --> 46:53.430
What time is it?

46:53.608 --> 46:55.098
- 4:30.
- 4:30.

46:55.277 --> 46:57.177
4:32.

46:59.447 --> 47:03.144
- I can't go down Whitworth right now.
- Okay.

47:03.885 --> 47:05.216
We should go this way.

47:06.521 --> 47:08.512
- What's up?
- Chris Gardocki.

47:08.690 --> 47:09.987
- What?
- He gets in my face...

47:10.158 --> 47:12.490
...and I just don't wanna
deal with the hassle now.

47:12.661 --> 47:15.459
- Are you this scared?
- Can we please go the long way?

47:17.165 --> 47:18.723
- Down Cutler?
- Yeah.

47:18.900 --> 47:20.663
But that's 45 minutes.

47:20.835 --> 47:22.598
You're gonna shame me
into doing this.

47:22.771 --> 47:25.239
- You sound stupid.
- You'll be sorry. Okay, I'm stupid.

47:25.407 --> 47:27.534
Oh, man.

47:28.276 --> 47:30.972
Oh, God, there they are.

47:32.347 --> 47:34.406
Oh, my God, is that Dale Doback?

47:34.582 --> 47:37.142
- Let's make him lick dog shit.
- Yeah.

47:38.820 --> 47:42.153
Hey, fag-stick. Long time, no see.

47:42.324 --> 47:44.952
Is that your boyfriend?
Is that your butt buddy?

47:45.260 --> 47:47.524
Look, Mr. Gardocki,
just leave me alone, will you?

47:47.696 --> 47:49.493
<i>Shut your mouth, esé.</i>

47:49.664 --> 47:52.827
You guys just go back and have fun
on your jungle gym, okay?

47:53.001 --> 47:55.196
Does butt buddy have a name?

47:55.370 --> 47:59.272
If you're referring to me as
butt buddy, yes, I do have a name.

47:59.441 --> 48:00.772
It's Brennan Huff.

48:00.942 --> 48:04.105
If you don't come over here
and lick that white dog shit...

48:04.279 --> 48:06.509
...l'm gonna plow into your nose
with my fist.

48:06.681 --> 48:10.549
- I'm not licking any white dog shit.
- I'll lick the shit if you leave us alone.

48:10.719 --> 48:13.882
Dale, you're not licking
dog shit, okay? They're kids.

48:14.055 --> 48:16.319
- Brennan, it's just dog shit.
- It's ridiculous!

48:16.491 --> 48:20.450
- Hello, how are...?
- Oh, God!

48:20.795 --> 48:23.389
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

48:25.033 --> 48:26.557
Get them!

48:38.680 --> 48:41.877
So maybe you don't
go down that way anymore.

48:42.050 --> 48:43.915
Maybe you go the long way home.

48:44.085 --> 48:46.986
That's what we talked about.
We'll take the long way home.

48:47.155 --> 48:49.919
<i>You know in that one scene
in The Wizard of Oz...</i>

48:50.091 --> 48:52.924
...when the flying monkeys
pull apart the Scarecrow?

48:53.094 --> 48:55.119
That's what it was like.

48:55.296 --> 48:57.787
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

48:57.966 --> 49:00.594
Is my dad mad about
the stuff that happened?

49:00.769 --> 49:03.363
Robert was very upset, yes.

49:03.538 --> 49:06.234
He knows that you interviewed
as a team.

49:06.408 --> 49:07.932
And he heard about the fart.

49:08.109 --> 49:10.043
- Oh, he did?
- Yeah.

49:10.211 --> 49:11.940
You just couldn't hold it, or you...?

49:12.113 --> 49:15.048
- No. I thought it was gonna be silent.
- It was not silent.

49:15.216 --> 49:17.878
Just kept going, and it made a sound.
It was embarrassing.

49:18.052 --> 49:19.076
It got louder.

49:19.254 --> 49:22.121
So listen, Bobby,
I'll get those keys made tomorrow...

49:22.290 --> 49:25.782
...and then we'll start setting up times.
- Thank you.

49:27.061 --> 49:28.494
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

49:28.663 --> 49:29.857
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

49:30.031 --> 49:32.261
- Always nice to see you.
- You too.

49:41.810 --> 49:42.970
Hey, guys.

49:43.144 --> 49:45.237
Looks like your
free ride's over, huh?

49:45.413 --> 49:47.210
Have fun living on the streets.

49:47.816 --> 49:50.307
Okay, cool. Good chatting, you guys.
Bye, Mom.

49:50.485 --> 49:51.713
- Bye.
- See you, buddy.

49:55.790 --> 49:57.189
What was he doing here?

49:57.459 --> 49:59.188
We're putting the house
on the market.

49:59.461 --> 50:02.897
- Where are we moving?
- Is the house haunted?

50:03.164 --> 50:05.724
Nancy and I are retiring...

50:05.900 --> 50:08.664
...and sailing around the world
on my boat.

50:08.837 --> 50:11.135
We are living the dream.

50:11.306 --> 50:12.603
Well, what about us?

50:14.642 --> 50:19.011
I'm sorry. Robert... We thought that...

50:19.180 --> 50:22.980
...you should take responsibility
for your own lives.

50:23.151 --> 50:24.345
This is the exciting part:

50:24.519 --> 50:26.851
We're going to put enough
money in your accounts...

50:27.021 --> 50:28.989
...for a security deposit
on an apartment.

50:29.157 --> 50:30.454
What's this all about?

50:30.625 --> 50:35.085
More than just money, we're gonna get
you another kind of support as well.

50:35.263 --> 50:38.096
You're both gonna see therapists.
Nancy thinks it'll help.

50:38.266 --> 50:42.032
- Guys, that's nonnegotiable.
- Hold on. We're not going on the boat...

50:42.437 --> 50:45.531
...Derek's selling the house,
we have to go to therapy?

50:46.774 --> 50:48.674
- What the fuck happened?
- Hey!

50:48.843 --> 50:51.937
Look, I know this seems
really, really sudden...

50:52.113 --> 50:54.445
...and just sort of unfair
and cruel and...

50:54.616 --> 50:57.710
- But it's nonnegotiable.
- But it's nonnegotiable.

50:57.886 --> 51:00.320
I got a bellyful
of white dog crap in me...

51:00.488 --> 51:02.388
...and now you lay this shit on me?

51:02.557 --> 51:05.526
You're adults. It's time
you started acting like adults.

51:05.793 --> 51:08.728
- Mom.
- I'm not backing down, Brennan.

51:08.997 --> 51:10.328
Don't even try.

51:10.498 --> 51:13.558
I know it seems hard,
but it's the best thing for both of you.

51:13.735 --> 51:15.362
We do it because we love you.

51:15.537 --> 51:19.234
Dad, I'm doing this because
I love you: fuck you.

51:19.407 --> 51:21.398
- Anything else?
- No.

51:21.576 --> 51:23.976
Bon voyage! Have a great time!

51:24.979 --> 51:26.913
Hey, what's up, Derek?

51:27.081 --> 51:28.105
Yeah.

51:28.283 --> 51:29.580
- Know what?
- Look what I got.

51:29.751 --> 51:33.016
I'm sitting here thinking we finally got
a family together here...

51:33.187 --> 51:36.679
...and now it's about to be taken away
because they think we're losers.

51:37.559 --> 51:41.051
- Because they don't understand us?
- Yeah.

51:41.229 --> 51:44.721
They don't get that this lifestyle
is a choice.

51:44.899 --> 51:48.027
And all they think about
is that stupid boat.

51:48.336 --> 51:51.567
I swear, I'm so pissed off
at my mom.

51:51.739 --> 51:55.231
As soon as she is of age,
I'm putting her in a home.

51:55.510 --> 51:58.138
We have got to get
Prestige Worldwide going.

51:58.313 --> 52:00.338
It's the thing that's
gonna save this family.

52:00.515 --> 52:03.348
I was thinking we should
have a investor presentation...

52:03.518 --> 52:04.780
<i>...like on The Apprentice.</i>

52:04.953 --> 52:07.114
We gotta start
with some capital somewhere.

52:07.288 --> 52:09.188
Here's the thing, though:

52:09.357 --> 52:12.554
If we're gonna start
a huge multinational corporation...

52:12.727 --> 52:14.251
...I have to hear you sing.

52:14.429 --> 52:17.125
Can't you just trust that
I'm a really, really good singer?

52:17.532 --> 52:20.933
Just one song, so I know
what your voice sounds like.

52:21.269 --> 52:23.203
Yeah, yeah. I'll just do it.

52:23.371 --> 52:27.535
No big deal. I'll just dive into it
and just start singing.

52:31.279 --> 52:34.646
Jesus, my heart is beating
so fast right now.

52:35.416 --> 52:37.543
Okay, just do it. Just do it.

52:37.719 --> 52:38.777
Just...

53:28.269 --> 53:29.327
You know, I don't know.

53:29.504 --> 53:32.769
I didn't sing too loud, because I don't
wanna wake up Robert and Nancy.

53:32.940 --> 53:36.376
My throat's sore. I've had
a sore throat for a month and a half.

53:36.644 --> 53:39.374
And this is not an acoustic
environment that's suitable...

53:39.547 --> 53:41.606
...to request this from me.

53:41.783 --> 53:45.048
You gotta know,
I'm not just some guy.

53:45.219 --> 53:48.711
Brennan, that is
the voice of an angel.

53:50.391 --> 53:53.121
Brennan, I can't even make
eye contact with you right now.

53:53.294 --> 53:56.058
Your voice is like a combination
of Fergie and Jesus.

53:56.230 --> 53:58.095
Why can't you do that
in front of people?

53:58.266 --> 54:00.097
Are you messing with me right now?

54:00.535 --> 54:03.197
It's me, Dale.

54:04.472 --> 54:05.496
You're good.

54:06.140 --> 54:08.540
- I know.
- This is gonna sound weird...

54:08.710 --> 54:13.807
...but for a second, I think
you took on the shape of a unicorn.

54:13.981 --> 54:17.815
I felt like I was hovering
above my own body...

54:17.985 --> 54:19.577
...watching myself sing.

54:19.754 --> 54:21.517
Now, let's move on
to other business.

54:21.689 --> 54:25.181
First thing tomorrow, we gotta get
cracking on this investor presentation.

54:25.359 --> 54:28.294
And guess what else.
This just came to me.

54:28.463 --> 54:31.899
- We're making a music video.
- Yeah!

54:33.034 --> 54:34.899
What do we do about Derek
and the house?

54:36.738 --> 54:38.672
Don't worry about him.

54:49.417 --> 54:50.645
Oh, it's a great "nabe."

54:50.818 --> 54:52.718
Frank Gifford
used to live down the block.

54:52.887 --> 54:56.015
- The Giff?
- Yeah, the Giff. Right down the block.

54:56.190 --> 54:58.750
I'm getting
a really good feeling about this.

54:58.926 --> 54:59.950
I am so glad.

55:00.128 --> 55:02.790
You get us that 10-year
interest-only loan, we got a deal.

55:02.964 --> 55:05.956
Hey, fuckers!
Welcome to the neighborhood!

55:06.134 --> 55:09.934
- My name is Craig.
- The neighbor is a Nazi?

55:10.104 --> 55:13.972
You guys ever need fertilizer,
I've got a lot of it. Close to 80 tons.

55:14.142 --> 55:18.044
Hey, folks! How you doing?
You're gonna love this neighborhood.

55:18.212 --> 55:19.873
Every single house here recycles.

55:20.047 --> 55:21.981
- Okay, we're done here.
- Yeah, okay.

55:22.150 --> 55:25.119
<i>Hey, Derek, sprechen sie dick.</i>

55:25.453 --> 55:27.887
Dale, I don't know how much
you know about therapy...

55:28.055 --> 55:31.252
...but it usually starts by you
telling me something about yourself.

55:31.793 --> 55:33.852
I work at a college as a janitor...

55:34.028 --> 55:36.656
...even though I'm smarter
than most of the people there.

55:36.831 --> 55:39.732
Sometimes I see an equation
written on a blackboard...

55:39.901 --> 55:42.893
...like half an equation,
and I'll just figure it out.

55:43.070 --> 55:45.402
<i>- Is this Good Will Hunting?
- No.</i>

55:45.740 --> 55:48.573
<i>It sounds a lot like the plot
of Good Will Hunting.</i>

55:48.743 --> 55:52.474
Yeah. Anyway.
My best friend is Ben Affleck...

55:52.647 --> 55:55.741
So I thought we'd begin
talking about your parents' divorce.

55:56.050 --> 55:57.074
Okay.

55:57.251 --> 55:59.276
How old were you
when they got divorced?

55:59.453 --> 56:01.580
- Fifteen.
- That's a hard age.

56:01.856 --> 56:04.689
- Yes. Yeah.
- Do you wanna talk...

56:04.859 --> 56:06.986
...about some of those feelings?
- I love you.

56:07.161 --> 56:10.597
- Obviously, you don't know me.
- I love you so much.

56:10.765 --> 56:14.166
Thank you. And I will take that
as a feeling that you have...

56:14.335 --> 56:16.701
...of comfortability with me.

56:16.871 --> 56:18.532
It's more than comfortability.

56:18.706 --> 56:21.903
- I mean, I fucking love you.
- Okay. I th...

56:22.076 --> 56:23.976
I'm just thinking
about our life together.

56:24.545 --> 56:26.513
I feel like I'm walking on a cloud.

56:26.681 --> 56:28.808
My penis is tingling right now.

56:29.083 --> 56:32.678
- That is so off-putting.
- You're not feeling this?

56:33.020 --> 56:36.786
In no way, shape or form do I feel
any feelings of intimacy towards you...

56:36.958 --> 56:38.949
...in any way whatsoever.

56:39.126 --> 56:40.957
You got a really dope
front lawn here.

56:41.128 --> 56:43.062
You and your homeboys
can play on that.

56:43.231 --> 56:45.199
- You can just say "It looks good."
- Yeah.

56:45.366 --> 56:46.390
No, that's how I talk.

56:46.567 --> 56:49.900
Oh, you got a really fresh
entryway here. Pretty awesome.

56:50.071 --> 56:52.733
- show you the front of the house,
which is actual...

56:52.907 --> 56:56.968
Will you vultures please give us some
privacy? He just died last night.

56:57.144 --> 56:58.668
What is going on here?

56:58.846 --> 57:01.144
It was the asbestos in here,
that's what did it!

57:01.315 --> 57:02.782
I've seen too many dead bodies.

57:02.950 --> 57:05.350
- I can't be in here. I can't.
- No, no, no.

57:08.256 --> 57:11.282
- Not bad.
- Eat shit, Derek.

57:11.659 --> 57:15.095
- Awesome B-day party, broheisens.
- You the man, Derek.

57:15.263 --> 57:17.629
Okay, who's this from? TJ?

57:17.798 --> 57:19.766
Where are
the rest of my gifts, dude?

57:19.934 --> 57:21.765
Totally joking around, TJ.

57:21.936 --> 57:23.198
All right.

57:23.371 --> 57:27.740
Oh, yes! Yes! Callaway 3-wood.

57:27.909 --> 57:29.171
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

57:30.077 --> 57:31.101
Yeah.

57:31.545 --> 57:33.843
- Bomb it down the fairway, bitches!
- That's right.

57:36.651 --> 57:39.119
Hi, my name is Jim.
Wanna suck my dick for money?

57:39.687 --> 57:41.917
- It's just me. Hi.
- Oh, my God.

57:42.089 --> 57:44.387
What are you doing?
This is the men's bathroom.

57:44.558 --> 57:46.389
Happy anniversary.

57:46.560 --> 57:48.892
- It's our second date.
- What?

57:49.063 --> 57:52.999
Listen, I'm sick of being
all coy and bashful, Dale. Okay?

57:53.167 --> 57:56.034
- We're in the bathroom.
- This'll just take a minute.

57:56.203 --> 57:59.468
There's really little you can
do about it. Let me just hop on.

58:01.042 --> 58:03.010
It's all slippery.

58:03.978 --> 58:05.002
Oh, my God!

58:10.484 --> 58:13.214
It's getting tingly.
Something's gonna happen, Alice!

58:21.595 --> 58:23.529
Oh, we just had sex.

58:23.698 --> 58:27.065
- Just the way I imagined it.
- I like you.

58:28.102 --> 58:29.262
I love you.

58:29.437 --> 58:31.598
- Stay golden, Ponyboy. I gotta pee.
- Okay.

58:33.607 --> 58:35.734
Oh, my God.

58:35.977 --> 58:38.002
You're incredible.

58:38.179 --> 58:40.579
Say hello to my little friend.

58:42.717 --> 58:45.151
<i>- Just kidding. It's from Scarface.
- Scarface.</i>

58:47.121 --> 58:48.486
Shut the fuck up!

58:49.290 --> 58:51.349
- Sweet-ass gift, Teej.
- Yeah, not bad.

58:51.792 --> 58:53.259
- I got it all mapped out.
- Okay.

58:53.427 --> 58:56.760
- I'm following your lead, though.
- I'll get all eyes on us.

58:56.931 --> 58:58.296
- Okay.
- Just like we planned.

58:58.466 --> 59:00.559
And then we'll drop the hammer.

59:00.768 --> 59:04.636
What were Dale and Brennan doing
with my video camera, do you know?

59:04.805 --> 59:07.467
I have no idea. And frankly,
I really don't care. So...

59:08.509 --> 59:10.033
I would like to say a few things.

59:10.211 --> 59:13.476
Derek, you are an outstanding
young man, son.

59:13.647 --> 59:16.172
And I would like say that
this is the image I have:

59:16.350 --> 59:19.547
That sometimes when I'm making love
to your mother and I realize that...

59:19.720 --> 59:22.154
...this is where you came from,
that I'm so moved...

59:22.323 --> 59:25.554
...that I talked to my lawyer,
and not only are you going to be...

59:25.726 --> 59:28.786
...in my heart forever, but you're
going to be in my will, young man.

59:28.963 --> 59:30.521
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

59:30.798 --> 59:32.925
- Robert, that was fucking awesome.
- Thank you.

59:33.100 --> 59:35.864
You got a lot of this, buddy.
And you got a lot of these.

59:36.070 --> 59:37.298
Thank you.

59:37.471 --> 59:39.871
Everyone, if I could have
your attention, please.

59:40.875 --> 59:42.365
For those of you
who don't know me...

59:42.543 --> 59:43.976
...my name's Dale Doback.
- Check. Check.

59:44.145 --> 59:46.978
I'm Robert's other son,
the biological one.

59:47.181 --> 59:49.046
Check. Check.

59:49.216 --> 59:51.912
Probably wondering
why we gathered you here tonight...

59:52.086 --> 59:53.883
...besides Derek's birthday.

59:54.455 --> 59:57.447
We got a special surprise for you,
Derek, and everybody here...

59:57.625 --> 59:58.717
- Check, check.
- Check.

59:58.893 --> 1:00:00.861
- Dale. No, please.
- Don't interrupt them.

1:00:01.028 --> 1:00:03.019
- I'm begging you.
- You wanna shut this down?

1:00:03.197 --> 1:00:05.165
- Just hold on.
- Derek, for your birthday...

1:00:05.332 --> 1:00:06.731
...we thought we'd roll out...

1:00:06.901 --> 1:00:09.096
...a once-in-a-lifetime
business opportunity.

1:00:09.270 --> 1:00:10.396
Happy birthday, Derek.

1:00:10.938 --> 1:00:12.200
Music.

1:00:15.743 --> 1:00:20.874
Prestige Worldwide,
wide, wide, wide.

1:00:21.048 --> 1:00:23.312
Prestige Worldwide.

1:00:23.484 --> 1:00:26.282
- The first word in entertainment.
- First word.

1:00:26.587 --> 1:00:28.521
- Management.
- Financial portfolios.

1:00:28.689 --> 1:00:30.486
- Insurance.
- Computers.

1:00:30.658 --> 1:00:33.991
- Black leather gloves.
- Research and development.

1:00:34.228 --> 1:00:37.129
Putting in the man-hours to study
the science of what you need.

1:00:37.298 --> 1:00:40.290
Last week we put Liquid Paper
on a bee...

1:00:40.468 --> 1:00:41.765
...and it died.

1:00:41.936 --> 1:00:43.301
- Security.
- Security.

1:00:43.471 --> 1:00:44.733
- And...
- And.

1:00:47.208 --> 1:00:48.641
- Possibly you.
- Possibly you.

1:00:48.909 --> 1:00:51.935
- Oh, this is classic. This is...
- We'd like to present...

1:00:52.780 --> 1:00:56.375
...the world premiere of Prestige
Worldwide's first music video...

1:00:56.550 --> 1:01:00.714
...by our first act, Huff and Doback.

1:01:00.888 --> 1:01:03.857
- Roll it.
- Roll it.

1:01:04.391 --> 1:01:08.157
Pay close attention, Dad.
It's gonna look familiar.

1:01:08.329 --> 1:01:11.264
- This is... This is perfect.
- Is that my boat?

1:01:11.432 --> 1:01:13.696
Yes, it is.

1:01:14.068 --> 1:01:15.467
What are you doing on my boat?

1:01:15.636 --> 1:01:18.127
<i>The Niña, the Pinta
The Santa María</i>

1:01:18.305 --> 1:01:20.830
<i>I'll do you in the bottom
While you're drinking sangria</i>

1:01:21.008 --> 1:01:23.442
<i>Nachos and Lemonheads
On my dad's boat</i>

1:01:23.611 --> 1:01:25.636
<i>You won't go down
'Cause my dick can float</i>

1:01:25.813 --> 1:01:28.373
<i>We sail around the world
And go port to port</i>

1:01:28.549 --> 1:01:31.143
<i>Every time I come
I produce a quart</i>

1:01:31.318 --> 1:01:33.616
That is offensive. Brennan, Dale.

1:01:33.787 --> 1:01:36.221
<i>I gotta have me my boats and ho's</i>

1:01:36.390 --> 1:01:38.551
<i>Deadliest Catch without the crabs</i>

1:01:38.726 --> 1:01:41.354
<i>We're almost out of gas
Call the Arabs</i>

1:01:41.529 --> 1:01:43.793
<i>Pull up the anchor
'Cause we're leaving dry land</i>

1:01:43.964 --> 1:01:46.455
<i>Get below deck
With a dick in your hand</i>

1:01:46.634 --> 1:01:48.864
<i>Boats and ho's
Boats and ho's</i>

1:01:49.036 --> 1:01:51.834
<i>I gotta have me my boats and ho's</i>

1:01:52.006 --> 1:01:54.201
<i>Are you ready for some
world-class vocalization?</i>

1:01:54.375 --> 1:01:56.036
- Get a partner.
- Wait a minute.

1:01:56.210 --> 1:01:58.838
- Who's steering the boat?
- Dad, please shut up.

1:01:59.013 --> 1:02:00.241
Please shut up!

1:02:10.024 --> 1:02:11.821
Yeah!

1:02:17.464 --> 1:02:18.897
So...

1:02:19.066 --> 1:02:21.330
...big question is:

1:02:21.902 --> 1:02:25.360
Aside from the damage to the boat,
which we will fix...

1:02:26.440 --> 1:02:28.271
...what'd you think
of the presentation?

1:02:28.442 --> 1:02:34.540
Brennan, I think that what you did
to Robert's boat was horrid.

1:02:34.715 --> 1:02:37.047
Having said that,
I think that both of you boys...

1:02:37.218 --> 1:02:40.676
...showed a lot of enthusiasm
and inventiveness.

1:02:40.854 --> 1:02:42.913
Yes. Thank you.

1:02:43.224 --> 1:02:45.215
You gotta be kidding me.

1:02:46.093 --> 1:02:48.721
They destroyed our dream
and you're calling it inventive.

1:02:48.896 --> 1:02:51.490
- No, no, no. I didn't mean it like that.
- Yes, you did.

1:02:51.665 --> 1:02:52.893
Come on, you did.

1:02:53.300 --> 1:02:56.633
It's gonna be four years, at least,
before we can sail anywhere.

1:02:56.804 --> 1:03:00.205
- And you could care less, admit it.
- I will not admit that...

1:03:00.374 --> 1:03:02.774
...because it is not true.
- Oh, yeah.

1:03:02.943 --> 1:03:06.003
But, you know,
I do think that you could show...

1:03:06.180 --> 1:03:10.241
...a little bit more attentiveness
to your son and your stepson...

1:03:10.417 --> 1:03:12.078
...who obviously need you.

1:03:12.253 --> 1:03:13.515
It's true, Dr. Doback.

1:03:13.687 --> 1:03:16.554
You've been very cold
and unsupportive of our dreams.

1:03:16.724 --> 1:03:18.521
You wrecked my fucking boat,
you goon!

1:03:18.692 --> 1:03:20.751
Don't speak to my son like that.

1:03:20.928 --> 1:03:23.453
Your son's costing me $80,000.

1:03:23.631 --> 1:03:26.862
We could bicker about this all night,
but what's done is done, Dad.

1:03:27.034 --> 1:03:29.867
- Are you guys gonna invest or not?
- That's it! That's it!

1:03:30.037 --> 1:03:31.800
- What are you doing?
- Grab the wheel!

1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:34.403
I can't believe
you're being so stingy.

1:03:34.575 --> 1:03:37.066
- Robert, come down.
- It's a simple business decision.

1:03:37.244 --> 1:03:38.905
You jackaloons!

1:03:39.079 --> 1:03:42.515
You're failures! Failures!

1:03:42.683 --> 1:03:45.550
And you're embarrassing yourself,
you geriatric fuck!

1:03:45.719 --> 1:03:47.152
- Brennan.
- Two things:

1:03:47.321 --> 1:03:50.119
You keep your liver-spotted hands
off my beautiful mother.

1:03:50.291 --> 1:03:51.349
She's a saint!

1:03:51.525 --> 1:03:55.086
Then you sit down and you write Dale
and Brennan a check for $ 10,000.

1:03:55.262 --> 1:03:56.286
Oh, stop it.

1:03:56.463 --> 1:04:00.331
Or I'm gonna shove one of those fake
hearing devices so far up your ass...

1:04:00.501 --> 1:04:02.264
- Brennan!
...you can hear the sound...

1:04:02.436 --> 1:04:05.269
...of your small intestine
as it produces shit!

1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:07.701
- All right, here we go.
- Oh, my Lord.

1:04:07.875 --> 1:04:10.935
Somebody should've done this
a long time ago, and I'm gonna do it.

1:04:11.111 --> 1:04:12.578
- What are you doing?
- Robert.

1:04:12.746 --> 1:04:14.577
There are consequences
for your actions.

1:04:14.748 --> 1:04:17.444
- No! Robert!
- Dad!

1:04:17.618 --> 1:04:19.711
- This is not the answer.
- You're next, mister.

1:04:19.887 --> 1:04:21.013
- You understand me?
- Yes.

1:04:21.188 --> 1:04:24.248
- Certain behaviors...
- Let go of me.

1:04:24.491 --> 1:04:27.551
...will not be tolerated!
- My ass is on fire!

1:04:37.805 --> 1:04:42.367
Wow, the tree looks great, Nancy.
Really tasteful.

1:04:42.543 --> 1:04:46.070
Thank you, Dale. That's a very nice
sweater you're wearing.

1:04:46.480 --> 1:04:49.847
It was my mom's.
I took the shoulder pads out.

1:04:50.017 --> 1:04:51.917
Oh, and, Brennan? Denise called...

1:04:52.086 --> 1:04:54.646
...and she said she can't go out
with you on New Year's Eve...

1:04:54.822 --> 1:04:57.689
...because she's not your girlfriend,
she's your therapist.

1:04:57.858 --> 1:04:59.189
- Is that what she said?
- Yeah.

1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:00.418
She's a rascal.

1:05:00.994 --> 1:05:02.928
Hey, Dad, Nancy?

1:05:03.097 --> 1:05:08.160
Would it be cool if Brennan and I
opened just one present each...

1:05:08.335 --> 1:05:10.496
...since it's Christmas Eve?

1:05:10.671 --> 1:05:13.538
I'm gonna go down to the
Cheesecake Factory, have a drink.

1:05:16.210 --> 1:05:19.304
But it's Christmas Eve.

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:21.243
Merry Christmas.

1:05:22.015 --> 1:05:23.846
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1:05:24.017 --> 1:05:26.212
I had my eye on one.

1:05:26.653 --> 1:05:28.553
I hope it's what I think it is.

1:05:28.722 --> 1:05:30.917
Oh, my God. Hulk Hands!

1:05:31.091 --> 1:05:32.581
Wait, Dale got Hulk Hands?

1:05:37.765 --> 1:05:41.132
Well, you reek of Scotch
and cheesecake.

1:05:42.102 --> 1:05:43.592
You know...

1:05:44.405 --> 1:05:49.172
...tonight at the Cheesecake Factory
was the happiest I've been in months.

1:05:49.576 --> 1:05:52.977
- Well, then I feel very sorry for you.
- Well, just...

1:05:53.147 --> 1:05:57.083
Nancy, I don't know if I can ever
forgive them for wrecking my boat.

1:05:57.251 --> 1:05:59.947
- Why are you giving up?
- I'm not giving up. I'm not.

1:06:00.120 --> 1:06:04.113
- You are. You're giving up on our boys.
- But they're 40.

1:06:04.291 --> 1:06:07.260
I don't care how old they are.
They're still our children.

1:06:07.428 --> 1:06:10.488
Well, sometime it's got to matter
how old they are.

1:06:10.664 --> 1:06:13.394
That's all we do, is...
Oh, sweet Jesus.

1:06:13.567 --> 1:06:17.128
Oh, it...
You know, they'll go back to bed.

1:06:17.971 --> 1:06:19.734
See? They're sleepwalking.

1:06:19.907 --> 1:06:21.898
No. No.

1:06:22.075 --> 1:06:24.305
See, back to bed.

1:06:24.478 --> 1:06:25.740
They'll be fine.

1:06:26.146 --> 1:06:28.614
Just nonsense.
I'm gonna wake them up.

1:06:28.782 --> 1:06:32.240
- No. Why would you do such a thing?
- Well, because it's...

1:06:32.419 --> 1:06:34.819
- Never, ever wake up a sleepwalker.
- See, that's it.

1:06:34.988 --> 1:06:36.455
- We can't ever do anything.
- No.

1:06:36.623 --> 1:06:39.091
But they could do real harm
to themselves or others.

1:06:39.259 --> 1:06:41.819
- Oh, the Christmas presents.
- No, guys... No, no, don't...

1:06:41.995 --> 1:06:44.361
- No. But...
- I think we should take control.

1:06:44.531 --> 1:06:47.762
- It's always about them.
- How do you propose to do that?

1:06:47.935 --> 1:06:50.096
- Oh, Jesus.
- Whatever you do, don't wake them.

1:06:50.270 --> 1:06:53.296
They might do real harm
to themselves or others.

1:06:53.474 --> 1:06:56.307
- Not everybody does know that.
- Oh, the Christmas tree!

1:06:56.477 --> 1:06:59.640
Oh, not the... No, don't...
All right, that's it!

1:06:59.813 --> 1:07:01.474
- I'm waking them up!
- No! No!

1:07:01.648 --> 1:07:03.275
- Don't wake them up!
- That's a myth!

1:07:03.450 --> 1:07:04.940
- Wake up, both of you.
- Don't.

1:07:07.020 --> 1:07:09.614
I told you! I told you!

1:07:10.390 --> 1:07:12.881
Stop it! Don't hurt him!

1:07:13.327 --> 1:07:16.524
The pictures! Nancy!

1:07:20.901 --> 1:07:22.766
Robert!

1:07:29.510 --> 1:07:32.172
I mean, I was driving around
with a buddy of mine, Topher.

1:07:32.346 --> 1:07:33.745
You guys remember Topher, right?

1:07:33.914 --> 1:07:36.314
Driving around, he has this
brand-new Testarossa, right?

1:07:36.917 --> 1:07:40.478
We hit this four-point buck. Dead.
Lying in the road.

1:07:40.754 --> 1:07:42.881
Long story short,
we sue the state of Michigan.

1:07:43.056 --> 1:07:47.584
I end up getting 125 G's. Okay?
You know what I spent that money on?

1:07:47.761 --> 1:07:50.025
Sniper rifle to hunt deer.

1:07:52.466 --> 1:07:54.696
Either way, the deers lose,
my friends.

1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:02.865
Good riddance.
Eat all the damn flowers, anyway.

1:08:03.043 --> 1:08:04.476
If you'll excuse me...

1:08:04.645 --> 1:08:08.445
...I think I'm going to go into
the other room to check my hair.

1:08:08.916 --> 1:08:10.645
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, everybody.

1:08:10.817 --> 1:08:12.717
If you'll excuse
my space-cadet wife here.

1:08:12.886 --> 1:08:15.047
Let's just say the meds
aren't helping.

1:08:15.956 --> 1:08:19.153
I'm kidding. Kidding. But not at all.

1:08:19.326 --> 1:08:21.624
I have to get some more gravy.

1:08:21.795 --> 1:08:23.763
- Oh, Dale, it's right there.
- Oh, no.

1:08:23.931 --> 1:08:26.695
Shush up, Nancy.
I have to get some more bread.

1:08:27.601 --> 1:08:29.626
What did I do to deserve that?

1:08:33.907 --> 1:08:35.772
What do any of us do
to deserve anything?

1:08:35.943 --> 1:08:39.970
I pay enough taxes to support
all these lazy goddamn liberals.

1:08:42.049 --> 1:08:46.986
Get off me! Off!
Get back. Get back! Back!

1:08:54.595 --> 1:08:56.654
- What do you want?
- Merry Christmas, darling.

1:08:56.830 --> 1:08:59.594
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, that was torture.

1:09:01.234 --> 1:09:04.692
I couldn't eat another bite of turkey
without thinking of you inside of me.

1:09:04.871 --> 1:09:06.600
Come on, let's try something illegal.

1:09:06.974 --> 1:09:09.101
So, Tommy, what did you
get for Christmas?

1:09:09.276 --> 1:09:14.509
Well, Santa brought me the Bowflex
and $ 1000 in fresh-minted $50 bills.

1:09:14.681 --> 1:09:19.345
Wanna know what I got
for Christmas? A crushed soul.

1:09:23.123 --> 1:09:25.114
- Alice, please.
- Sing along, Santa.

1:09:25.292 --> 1:09:26.452
You know this song.

1:09:26.627 --> 1:09:28.822
What is that noise?

1:09:29.663 --> 1:09:31.130
It's... This is the ghost.

1:09:31.398 --> 1:09:34.299
- Just try to be quiet. Okay.
- You're right. You're right.

1:09:34.468 --> 1:09:36.902
- We've got to be discreet.
- All right.

1:09:37.070 --> 1:09:40.130
No, no! Oh, hey.

1:09:40.540 --> 1:09:43.703
Are you all still talking in here?

1:09:43.877 --> 1:09:44.901
What are you doing?

1:09:46.279 --> 1:09:49.339
Alice was moving a chair from the
living room into the dining room...

1:09:49.516 --> 1:09:52.883
...for an extra chair
and her back went out.

1:09:53.053 --> 1:09:57.251
And I just did the best thing,
which is get right on the muscles...

1:09:57.424 --> 1:09:59.085
- Muscles.
...so they don't seize up.

1:09:59.259 --> 1:10:01.853
Just add some heat to it.

1:10:04.731 --> 1:10:06.130
Damn it, Dale, sit down.

1:10:06.299 --> 1:10:09.826
It's just a real deep, tight muscle.

1:10:10.003 --> 1:10:11.766
Hey, sweetie,
can you grab me a beer?

1:10:11.938 --> 1:10:13.667
- I'll get you another Heineken.
- Yeah.

1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:15.831
Merry Christmas.

1:10:16.309 --> 1:10:19.142
And how about you, Tiffany,
what did you get for Christmas?

1:10:19.312 --> 1:10:21.872
I got this Mikimoto pearl necklace.

1:10:22.049 --> 1:10:25.450
But next year I'm gonna ask
Santa for breast implants...

1:10:25.619 --> 1:10:27.519
...because I'm impatient
with my body.

1:10:27.688 --> 1:10:31.089
Hey, Tiffany. Wanna know
what I got? A crushed soul.

1:10:31.358 --> 1:10:32.825
You mentioned that earlier.

1:10:34.294 --> 1:10:35.784
- So good.
- Oh, gosh!

1:10:35.962 --> 1:10:39.796
It's gone into a real bad spasm,
so I put a yoga move on her.

1:10:41.368 --> 1:10:44.496
- grant me this one,
because I was pretty wasted.

1:10:44.671 --> 1:10:46.298
So I put my lips
around that breathalyzer...

1:10:46.940 --> 1:10:49.238
...and I saw those numerals pop up:

1:10:49.409 --> 1:10:53.675
0.079.

1:10:54.381 --> 1:10:58.818
So I started going to Chad
Michael Murray's Christmas party.

1:10:58.985 --> 1:11:01.078
I think that was the year.
And just driving...

1:11:01.254 --> 1:11:04.815
I have to interrupt you. Robert, while
the children are in the living room...

1:11:04.991 --> 1:11:07.926
...I think this would be a good time
to make our announcement.

1:11:08.095 --> 1:11:10.996
- What's going on?
- It's over.

1:11:11.732 --> 1:11:14.496
I'm gonna be moving in
with my friend Jack Handle...

1:11:14.668 --> 1:11:17.159
...and Nancy found a townhouse
in the city.

1:11:18.438 --> 1:11:20.030
What is this? What's happening?

1:11:20.207 --> 1:11:23.643
What Robert is trying to say
is that we are getting a divorce.

1:11:24.044 --> 1:11:26.706
- Don't do this.
- No. No!

1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:28.575
- I could've called this one.
- No.

1:11:28.749 --> 1:11:30.614
- Yeah.
- Is it our fault?

1:11:30.784 --> 1:11:32.809
- Is it because we were bad?
- No. No.

1:11:32.986 --> 1:11:35.978
The main thing that
Robert and I talked about...

1:11:36.156 --> 1:11:38.716
...is that we did not want you two
to blame yourselves.

1:11:38.892 --> 1:11:42.259
- What can we do to fix it?
- Dale, honey, are you okay?

1:11:42.429 --> 1:11:45.330
- Why are you calling him "honey"?
- I cannot stress this enough:

1:11:45.499 --> 1:11:49.094
- It is not your fault.
- Whose fault is it?

1:11:49.269 --> 1:11:51.669
- Fuck it, I wanna fucking know!
- Let's cut the shit.

1:11:51.838 --> 1:11:55.433
- It is directly your fault.
- Robert.

1:11:55.609 --> 1:11:57.076
You destroyed my boat.

1:11:57.244 --> 1:11:58.802
You beat me up in your sleep...

1:11:58.979 --> 1:12:03.006
...and worst of all, you made
Nancy and I resent each other.

1:12:03.183 --> 1:12:07.882
- It is absolutely 150 percent your fault!
- Of course it's their fault.

1:12:08.054 --> 1:12:11.455
They're the world's biggest dickheads,
and they're living in your house.

1:12:11.625 --> 1:12:14.185
- Shut up, Derek.
- I'm sorry, but that...

1:12:15.162 --> 1:12:18.563
Please don't cry like that.
Please don't, Brennan.

1:12:22.402 --> 1:12:26.429
- Mommy!
- Dale!

1:12:26.606 --> 1:12:29.473
I told you that they would feel
completely to blame.

1:12:29.643 --> 1:12:33.409
- Oh, let's grow up.
- I think I'm going to throw up.

1:12:33.580 --> 1:12:35.980
- I think I'm gonna throw up...
- Don't throw up.

1:12:36.149 --> 1:12:39.050
...all the nice dinner that I had.
I'm gonna throw it up.

1:12:40.220 --> 1:12:42.484
- You're not gonna throw up.
- He's gonna throw up.

1:12:43.557 --> 1:12:46.390
- Come on.
- My God, he threw up. Oh, this is ugly.

1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:48.619
- Hey, guys. Guys.
- This is not nice!

1:12:48.795 --> 1:12:51.764
- All right, dipshits. Right here.
- Stop it, Derek.

1:12:51.932 --> 1:12:57.131
- One, two, three...
- I don't want my picture taken now.

1:13:03.176 --> 1:13:06.373
Good luck, and remember, I need you
out of this house by tomorrow.

1:13:06.546 --> 1:13:08.707
No exceptions.

1:13:17.357 --> 1:13:20.121
If there's anything you need,
anything that you boys need...

1:13:20.293 --> 1:13:22.989
...you just give me a call. Okay?
It's all right.

1:13:29.169 --> 1:13:32.866
Hey. Are you awake?

1:13:33.206 --> 1:13:34.867
Yeah.

1:13:37.377 --> 1:13:41.108
I can't believe we actually
have to move out of this house.

1:13:41.748 --> 1:13:44.114
I know. I feel bad.

1:13:44.384 --> 1:13:46.909
Hey, you know,
we don't have to whisper anymore.

1:13:47.087 --> 1:13:48.452
Mom and Dad aren't here.

1:13:48.622 --> 1:13:50.647
Yeah, but can we keep
doing it, though?

1:13:50.824 --> 1:13:52.985
It helps me pretend that they are.

1:13:53.159 --> 1:13:55.992
You must feel just terrible.

1:13:56.730 --> 1:13:59.893
- I mean, I know I feel bad.
- Yeah.

1:14:00.066 --> 1:14:02.398
But I can't imagine how you feel...

1:14:02.569 --> 1:14:05.504
...after my dad looked
right at you and said...

1:14:05.672 --> 1:14:08.140
...it's all your fault
that they broke up.

1:14:08.308 --> 1:14:12.176
That's funny, because my mom said:

1:14:12.345 --> 1:14:14.779
"If that curly-headed fuck Dale
wasn't here...

1:14:14.948 --> 1:14:17.382
...everything would be perfect."

1:14:18.184 --> 1:14:21.415
- You take that back.
- No way. It's your fault.

1:14:21.821 --> 1:14:23.584
You know what your problem is?

1:14:23.757 --> 1:14:26.521
You live in a fantasy land.
You refuse to get a job...

1:14:26.693 --> 1:14:29.389
...and you don't know what it's like
to work for something.

1:14:29.562 --> 1:14:33.157
You don't take responsibility for
your actions. This is all your fault!

1:14:33.333 --> 1:14:36.393
Well, you're a mama's boy
who's too chicken to sing in public!

1:14:38.505 --> 1:14:39.733
Yeah, that's right.

1:14:39.906 --> 1:14:42.204
Run away, little boy,
because you know it's true.

1:14:42.375 --> 1:14:43.933
Just avoid everything.

1:14:45.312 --> 1:14:46.973
What are you doing?

1:14:47.914 --> 1:14:50.747
<i>- Dale broke up Mom and Dad
- Motherfucker!</i>

1:14:50.917 --> 1:14:54.717
<i>Dale broke up Mom and Dad
Dale broke up Mom and Dad</i>

1:14:54.888 --> 1:14:56.753
<i>- Dale broke up Mom and...
- Brennan!</i>

1:15:02.562 --> 1:15:05.725
Get up, Brennan,
I know you're faking. Get up!

1:15:06.032 --> 1:15:07.693
Get up!

1:15:13.940 --> 1:15:14.964
Brennan?

1:15:15.141 --> 1:15:18.508
<i>It's just like Cold Case Files.
It's just like Cold Case Files.</i>

1:15:18.678 --> 1:15:20.543
<i>It's just like Cold Case Files.</i>

1:15:21.047 --> 1:15:23.208
People die every day.

1:15:23.583 --> 1:15:27.713
Give him a proper burial
in an unmarked grave...

1:15:31.791 --> 1:15:34.316
- Brennan! You're alive! Oh, my God.
- I know.

1:15:34.494 --> 1:15:35.825
I'm alive.

1:15:38.431 --> 1:15:42.094
- You were dead. I saw you die!
- I was faking.

1:15:42.268 --> 1:15:44.736
I used ninja focus
to slow my heart rate down.

1:15:45.772 --> 1:15:47.967
- What are you doing?
- I'm burying you.

1:15:48.141 --> 1:15:51.599
- I'm alive. Brennan, I'm alive.
- You're waking the neighbors!

1:15:51.778 --> 1:15:54.076
- Shut up!
- No. No.

1:15:55.348 --> 1:15:58.146
- Now I'm gonna play your drum set.
- Help me.

1:15:58.318 --> 1:16:01.116
Close your eyes.
Let the dirt just shower over you.

1:16:02.222 --> 1:16:04.349
This is your fault.

1:16:04.958 --> 1:16:09.452
Oh, I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna sleep good tonight.

1:16:12.232 --> 1:16:14.757
- Don't you touch my drums!
- Zombie!

1:16:15.235 --> 1:16:18.102
Zombie! Zombie!

1:16:19.706 --> 1:16:20.934
Get off me, zombie.

1:16:23.009 --> 1:16:24.101
Get off.

1:16:36.556 --> 1:16:37.784
I'm late for school.

1:16:37.957 --> 1:16:41.484
I will kiss you right on the mouth,
Kenny Rogers.

1:16:42.462 --> 1:16:45.022
- Just get off me.
- Hey.

1:16:48.468 --> 1:16:50.129
So I guess it's really over.

1:16:50.303 --> 1:16:53.170
I'd say you trying to bury me alive
pretty much did it.

1:16:53.339 --> 1:16:55.569
You know what I just realized?

1:16:55.742 --> 1:16:57.903
You've been the one
dragging me down.

1:16:58.078 --> 1:17:01.172
Now I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna
get a job and an apartment...

1:17:01.347 --> 1:17:04.316
...and then I'm gonna get Mom
and Dr. Doback back together.

1:17:04.484 --> 1:17:07.214
I'm gonna be the hero,
and you can suck on it.

1:17:10.490 --> 1:17:13.357
My life was perfect
before you came here.

1:17:13.526 --> 1:17:17.553
Me and my dad had a perfect setup,
and you wrecked it.

1:17:21.101 --> 1:17:22.466
Hey.

1:17:23.336 --> 1:17:25.531
We're no longer brothers.

1:17:25.905 --> 1:17:29.705
We never were.
We were stepbrothers.

1:17:42.622 --> 1:17:45.182
- That was one of your best.
- These balls fucking suck.

1:17:46.192 --> 1:17:47.454
All right.

1:17:48.094 --> 1:17:50.119
Well, well, well,
look who's here, boys.

1:17:50.663 --> 1:17:53.257
Can you give me a job, please?

1:17:54.367 --> 1:17:57.632
TJ, get an office pool going.

1:17:58.004 --> 1:18:00.768
Give Ken-Doll Crotch here
two weeks, tops.

1:18:01.441 --> 1:18:03.739
Dr. Angel Face,
I just wanted to say thank you...

1:18:03.910 --> 1:18:07.607
...for meeting me
on such short notice.

1:18:07.780 --> 1:18:10.112
- Don't call me Angel Face.
- I apologize.

1:18:10.283 --> 1:18:14.947
I'm very alone right now, and the thing
I wanna ask you to help me...

1:18:15.455 --> 1:18:18.219
To show me how I can be
a grown-up.

1:18:18.391 --> 1:18:20.416
Do I carry my
high-school diploma around?

1:18:20.593 --> 1:18:21.992
What do you do with your hair?

1:18:22.162 --> 1:18:24.289
What happens if there's
inclement weather?

1:18:24.464 --> 1:18:26.125
Where do you...?
What do you wear?

1:18:26.299 --> 1:18:28.096
Can you wash clothes
in the dishwasher?

1:18:28.268 --> 1:18:31.237
I notice that there's a long gap
in your job history...

1:18:31.404 --> 1:18:35.204
...and it said for 22 years...

1:18:35.375 --> 1:18:38.469
...you went Kerouac
on everyone's ass?

1:18:38.645 --> 1:18:40.909
I'm gonna be honest with you.
I really need a job.

1:18:41.080 --> 1:18:44.243
And I will take any position,
as long as it doesn't involve...

1:18:44.417 --> 1:18:48.444
...having sex with old ladies
for money or bear traps.

1:18:48.621 --> 1:18:51.181
- Those are my two bugaboos.
- All right, got it.

1:18:51.357 --> 1:18:54.121
There's a catering business,
there's a temp job open.

1:18:54.294 --> 1:18:56.762
And you get to play with fire.

1:20:09.068 --> 1:20:11.400
What do you want?
This is my online-poker time.

1:20:11.571 --> 1:20:13.869
I'm ready to take on
the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1:20:14.040 --> 1:20:15.940
Slow down there, Speed Racer.

1:20:16.109 --> 1:20:18.441
I know what it entails,
and I'm ready to nail it.

1:20:18.611 --> 1:20:21.171
I want it, okay?
I want the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1:20:21.347 --> 1:20:23.110
- Yo, yo.
- Hey, D-man.

1:20:23.283 --> 1:20:24.978
- You tell him what's up?
- I sure did.

1:20:25.151 --> 1:20:26.675
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:20:26.853 --> 1:20:29.287
Your brother wants a shot
at the Catalina Wine Mixer.

1:20:29.455 --> 1:20:30.615
I'm ready, walking tall.

1:20:30.790 --> 1:20:32.519
You're ready to run with the bulls?

1:20:32.692 --> 1:20:36.594
I've been earning and burning,
snapping necks and cashing checks.

1:20:37.063 --> 1:20:39.691
Screw it, let's let him do it.
It's a win-win for me...

1:20:39.866 --> 1:20:42.096
...because if you fuck up, Brennan...
- Yeah?

1:20:42.268 --> 1:20:46.432
...I get to fire your ass. But if you pull
it off, I look like a genius to the board.

1:20:47.407 --> 1:20:48.772
- Okay?
- I get it.

1:20:48.941 --> 1:20:50.238
Brennan, here's the thing.

1:20:50.410 --> 1:20:53.243
It's the Catalina fucking
Wine Mixer, okay?

1:20:53.513 --> 1:20:55.572
Are you saying "pow"?
What are you saying?

1:20:56.049 --> 1:20:59.507
It's the biggest helicopter-leasing
event in the Western Hemisphere...

1:20:59.686 --> 1:21:01.711
...since 1997.

1:21:02.221 --> 1:21:04.849
- Why does he keep doing that?
- I have to sell or lease...

1:21:05.024 --> 1:21:07.117
...at least 80 choppers
to make my nut.

1:21:07.293 --> 1:21:11.957
And you mess with my nut, Brennan,
Randy here is gonna eat your dick.

1:21:12.131 --> 1:21:14.622
Like Kobayashi.

1:21:16.269 --> 1:21:17.497
I've seen him do it.

1:21:17.670 --> 1:21:19.137
You've seen him eat a penis?

1:21:19.305 --> 1:21:22.172
It was in international waters,
so they couldn't prosecute him.

1:21:22.342 --> 1:21:24.833
I tell you now, I'll nail it.
I'll pull it off, okay?

1:21:25.011 --> 1:21:27.002
Wait a second,
why do you want this so bad?

1:21:27.180 --> 1:21:29.671
Trying to get Mom and Dad
back together or something?

1:21:29.849 --> 1:21:31.077
- Why do I want this?
- Yeah.

1:21:31.250 --> 1:21:36.119
Because I wanna make bank, bro.
I wanna get ass.

1:21:36.289 --> 1:21:38.018
And I wanna drive a Range Rover.

1:21:38.191 --> 1:21:39.681
Okay, well, you better, Brennan.

1:21:39.859 --> 1:21:41.952
This is the fucking
Catalina Wine Mixer.

1:22:00.580 --> 1:22:02.343
Nancy. Hi.

1:22:02.515 --> 1:22:06.007
Hi. What are you doing here?

1:22:06.185 --> 1:22:08.119
Well, Dale's working the function.

1:22:08.287 --> 1:22:11.154
Guys, this is supposed to be jicama,
not bok choy.

1:22:11.324 --> 1:22:12.348
Sorry, folks.

1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:16.126
And I got an invitation from Brennan.

1:22:16.295 --> 1:22:19.423
Can you believe
Brennan put all this together?

1:22:22.135 --> 1:22:24.729
And now here we all are in Catalina.

1:22:24.904 --> 1:22:28.567
- It's funny, huh?
- Yeah, it's funny.

1:22:28.741 --> 1:22:31.073
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey.

1:22:32.278 --> 1:22:34.371
Not bad. You're nailing it.

1:22:34.547 --> 1:22:36.777
- Thanks, Randy. That means a lot.
- Yeah.

1:22:36.949 --> 1:22:38.143
I don't know what it is...

1:22:38.317 --> 1:22:41.150
...but I wanna deliver one of these
right in your suck hole.

1:22:41.320 --> 1:22:44.414
- Is there anything I can do?
- No. Not really. It's your face.

1:22:44.590 --> 1:22:47.150
Again, you're doing great, man.
The Catalina Wine Mixer.

1:22:47.326 --> 1:22:49.226
We're all having a great time,
having fun.

1:22:49.395 --> 1:22:51.920
You pulled it off.
But if you don't change your face...

1:22:52.098 --> 1:22:54.225
...l'm gonna change it for you.
- Okay. Okay.

1:22:54.400 --> 1:22:56.527
All I can do is take that in,
consider it...

1:22:56.702 --> 1:22:59.967
...and I'll just do my best version
of whatever I think that would be.

1:23:00.139 --> 1:23:02.903
I don't even hear you,
your face is driving me nuts.

1:23:03.075 --> 1:23:05.134
- Thanks again, though.
- Oh, tits. Hold on.

1:23:05.578 --> 1:23:08.945
- Hey. Hello, Catalina Wine Mixer.
- Hi.

1:23:09.215 --> 1:23:11.649
How are you? We are Uptown Girl.

1:23:11.818 --> 1:23:15.618
We are California's preeminent
1980s Billy Joel cover band.

1:23:15.788 --> 1:23:17.551
"Piano Man"!

1:23:17.723 --> 1:23:19.657
What did I just say, man?

1:23:19.826 --> 1:23:21.589
All right, we don't play that...

1:23:21.761 --> 1:23:24.286
...so let's keep it in the '80s
and let's keep it fun.

1:23:24.464 --> 1:23:25.590
You having a good time?

1:23:25.765 --> 1:23:28.165
I hope you are,
because sometimes life can be tough.

1:23:29.869 --> 1:23:33.361
And I know that sometimes
it's hard to "Keeping the Faith."

1:23:43.816 --> 1:23:45.716
You guys seem to be hitting it off.

1:23:45.885 --> 1:23:47.182
Oh, honey.

1:23:47.353 --> 1:23:49.253
Oh, my God,
this is the greatest party.

1:23:49.422 --> 1:23:50.616
- Hello, Robert.
- Way to go.

1:23:50.790 --> 1:23:53.350
- Brennan, this is fantastic.
- Way to go.

1:23:53.526 --> 1:23:55.255
So impressed.

1:23:55.428 --> 1:23:57.453
- Hi, Dad. Hi, Nancy.
- Hi, Dale.

1:23:57.630 --> 1:23:59.359
- Hey, Brennan.
- It's good to see you.

1:23:59.565 --> 1:24:01.658
Thanks for hiring
our catering company.

1:24:01.834 --> 1:24:04.735
Easy decision. You guys have
a outstanding track record.

1:24:05.371 --> 1:24:08.067
- Just like old times, huh?
- Right, it really is.

1:24:08.241 --> 1:24:10.106
You still have your
night-vision goggles?

1:24:10.276 --> 1:24:14.178
No, no. No, I had to sell those
to pay for car insurance.

1:24:14.747 --> 1:24:16.715
How about you?
You still breaking boards...

1:24:16.883 --> 1:24:18.874
...or kicking holes in pumpkins
or anything?

1:24:19.051 --> 1:24:20.609
No.

1:24:21.287 --> 1:24:24.552
But I did start taking baby aspirin
to reduce my risk for heart attack.

1:24:24.724 --> 1:24:27.522
That makes sense.
Gotta keep an eye on it, you know.

1:24:27.693 --> 1:24:30.719
- Knock off the sweets.
- Thank you.

1:24:34.967 --> 1:24:38.061
It's a truly funny observation.

1:24:38.237 --> 1:24:39.431
Yeah.

1:24:39.605 --> 1:24:42.096
Dale, the empanadas
are starting to sweat.

1:24:42.275 --> 1:24:44.436
Okay. I better run.

1:24:44.610 --> 1:24:46.475
- It's good to see you, Brennan.
- You too.

1:24:46.646 --> 1:24:49.774
- Take care, be well. Take care, Dad.
- Okay, buddy.

1:24:49.949 --> 1:24:52.349
- It's great to talk to him.
- Yeah.

1:24:53.052 --> 1:24:54.212
I gotta go too.

1:24:54.387 --> 1:24:57.550
We should do this again.
I think it was very constructive.

1:25:01.794 --> 1:25:04.126
- Maybe grab a bite to eat?
- Sure.

1:25:04.297 --> 1:25:06.060
- Go to Outback Steakhouse.
- Okay.

1:25:06.232 --> 1:25:07.927
I've grown very fond of that place.

1:25:09.335 --> 1:25:11.235
Thank you for coming.

1:25:11.404 --> 1:25:13.167
Great to see you.

1:25:14.607 --> 1:25:17.075
It was very nice to see you, Robert.

1:25:17.577 --> 1:25:23.038
I think Brennan organized this
whole thing to get us back together.

1:25:24.951 --> 1:25:29.650
You have to excuse me.
I think that I just might cry.

1:25:29.822 --> 1:25:33.383
It's the funniest thing. Bye-bye.

1:25:37.363 --> 1:25:39.763
"Start the Fire," buddy!

1:25:40.333 --> 1:25:43.530
<i>Come on, man. Play something
from The Stranger!</i>

1:25:43.769 --> 1:25:46.533
We strictly do '80s Joel music, sir.

1:25:49.809 --> 1:25:51.777
'80s Billy Joel doo-wop sucks!

1:25:51.944 --> 1:25:54.504
Hey, listen, motherfucker,
we only sing '80s Joel!

1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:57.478
So take your skank hooker wife
and get the fuck out of here!

1:25:59.418 --> 1:26:00.442
Shit.

1:26:00.620 --> 1:26:02.679
- What's wrong?
- All right. "What's wrong?"

1:26:02.855 --> 1:26:05.050
Get him out of here.
Get his ass out of here!

1:26:05.324 --> 1:26:06.518
Hey.

1:26:06.692 --> 1:26:10.321
Hey, great job, fuck face. You just
busted my nut. This party's shot.

1:26:10.496 --> 1:26:13.021
Just relax. I didn't realize
he would say these things.

1:26:13.199 --> 1:26:14.962
You know what?
You cost me money.

1:26:15.134 --> 1:26:17.625
So this isn't even
a judgment call, man.

1:26:17.803 --> 1:26:20.704
- You're Audi 5000, my friend.
- Derek, can't we talk about this?

1:26:20.873 --> 1:26:22.033
No.

1:26:22.208 --> 1:26:23.971
- Hey.
- Shit.

1:26:24.143 --> 1:26:26.976
- Is everything okay?
- No. He just fired me.

1:26:27.146 --> 1:26:28.408
What happened to the music?

1:26:28.581 --> 1:26:31.345
The band left. The guy freaked out.

1:26:31.517 --> 1:26:32.677
Derek fired me.

1:26:32.852 --> 1:26:35.116
- It's no big deal.
- Robert, you don't get it.

1:26:35.287 --> 1:26:36.845
It's the Catalina Wine Mixer!

1:26:37.023 --> 1:26:39.253
People have killed
to be in the position I'm in.

1:26:39.425 --> 1:26:41.689
- He's right. It's a big deal.
- Here's a thought:

1:26:42.194 --> 1:26:44.424
I see an empty stage.

1:26:44.597 --> 1:26:47.327
I see drums, I see a drummer.

1:26:47.500 --> 1:26:49.900
I see a microphone,
and I see a singer.

1:26:50.069 --> 1:26:51.502
- Dad, come on.
- What?

1:26:51.671 --> 1:26:53.605
- We gave that stuff up.
- We don't do that.

1:26:53.773 --> 1:26:56.241
Listen to me.
Dale, look, when I was a kid...

1:26:56.409 --> 1:26:59.503
...when I was a little boy,
I always wanted to be a dinosaur.

1:26:59.679 --> 1:27:02.443
<i>I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus rex
more than anything.</i>

1:27:02.615 --> 1:27:05.584
I made my arms short
and I roamed the backyard...

1:27:05.751 --> 1:27:09.346
...and I chased the neighborhood cats,
and I growled and I roared.

1:27:09.522 --> 1:27:11.387
Everybody knew me
and was afraid of me.

1:27:11.557 --> 1:27:13.024
And then one day, my dad said:

1:27:13.192 --> 1:27:17.094
"Bobby, you're 17. It's time
to throw childish things aside."

1:27:17.263 --> 1:27:18.321
And I said, "Okay, Pop."

1:27:18.497 --> 1:27:22.456
But he didn't really say that, he said,
"Stop being a dinosaur and get a job."

1:27:22.635 --> 1:27:26.002
But, you know, I thought to myself,
"I'll go to medical school...

1:27:26.172 --> 1:27:29.403
...l'll practice for a little while,
and then I'll come back to it."

1:27:29.608 --> 1:27:31.473
- Dad...
- How is that a skill?

1:27:31.644 --> 1:27:33.202
But I forgot how to do it.

1:27:33.379 --> 1:27:34.607
You're human.

1:27:34.780 --> 1:27:36.975
- You could never be a dinosaur.
- Yeah.

1:27:38.484 --> 1:27:40.714
Hey, I lost it.

1:27:40.886 --> 1:27:42.877
- Dad, what's the point?
- Yeah.

1:27:43.055 --> 1:27:45.853
The point is
don't lose your dinosaur.

1:27:46.325 --> 1:27:49.158
Yeah. You know, I hated
the way you guys were before.

1:27:49.328 --> 1:27:50.556
I mean, I hated you.

1:27:50.730 --> 1:27:55.497
But it just kills me to see you
so crushed and normal.

1:27:55.668 --> 1:27:57.499
Listen to me, don't listen to me...

1:27:57.670 --> 1:28:00.901
...Prestige Worldwide,
that's what you gotta do.

1:28:01.073 --> 1:28:03.507
- You're saying we should go for it.
- That's what I'm saying.

1:28:05.111 --> 1:28:06.772
What do you think, Brennan?

1:28:06.946 --> 1:28:09.380
I'm so scared right now.
I'm gonna do what's sensible:

1:28:09.548 --> 1:28:11.140
I'm gonna file for unemployment...

1:28:11.317 --> 1:28:14.115
...and I'm gonna try to get a job
at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

1:28:14.286 --> 1:28:17.084
Because they got
a excellent corporate structure...

1:28:17.256 --> 1:28:20.248
...and they give you the tools
to be your own boss.

1:28:20.426 --> 1:28:22.326
My dad's right.

1:28:22.495 --> 1:28:24.019
This isn't me.

1:28:24.196 --> 1:28:27.359
I'm fucking miserable.
I had to get up at 10:00 this morning.

1:28:27.533 --> 1:28:31.367
And even though
I just got a tidal wave of nerves...

1:28:31.537 --> 1:28:33.232
...l'm going up on that stage...

1:28:33.405 --> 1:28:35.930
...and I'm gonna make beautiful music
for a sad world.

1:28:36.108 --> 1:28:38.440
- Dale...
- That's the boy I know.

1:28:38.611 --> 1:28:40.704
This crowd's gonna eat him alive.

1:28:43.015 --> 1:28:44.482
Wait, what's he doing up there?

1:28:44.650 --> 1:28:47.016
Somebody get him
off the fucking stage!

1:28:47.186 --> 1:28:49.279
Hi. How you doing?

1:28:49.455 --> 1:28:52.822
My name's Dale Doback,
and I hope you like to kick it.

1:28:52.992 --> 1:28:54.721
Oh, go get them, Dale!

1:28:56.195 --> 1:28:57.219
<i>Boats and ho's</i>

1:28:57.396 --> 1:28:59.261
Get off the stage, you dick!

1:28:59.632 --> 1:29:01.190
Stop yelling at him.

1:29:03.235 --> 1:29:04.930
- Terrible!
- Terrible.

1:29:05.104 --> 1:29:06.503
He's a human being.

1:29:06.672 --> 1:29:11.006
<i>Dale has a mangina
Dale has a mangina</i>

1:29:11.177 --> 1:29:12.269
No.

1:29:12.444 --> 1:29:14.571
<i>Gotta have me my boats and ho's</i>

1:29:14.747 --> 1:29:17.113
He's up there alone, Brennan.
He's up there alone.

1:29:18.450 --> 1:29:21.647
<i>Gotta have me my boats and ho's</i>

1:29:21.821 --> 1:29:23.652
- You suck!
- What are you doing, Brennan?

1:29:23.823 --> 1:29:24.915
<i>Gotta have me my...</i>

1:29:25.090 --> 1:29:27.354
Brennan, no!

1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:29.987
- What did you do?
- Oh, Jesus, Nancy.

1:29:30.162 --> 1:29:32.596
I couldn't stand to see him like that.
I miss my son.

1:29:32.865 --> 1:29:37.268
All right. Let me go for a few bars.
Come in soft, but then finish strong.

1:29:37.436 --> 1:29:39.404
- Okay. Hey, Brennan?
- Yeah.

1:29:39.572 --> 1:29:42.632
- Thanks for coming up.
- You got it, Dragon.

1:29:43.075 --> 1:29:44.633
We got a little change coming up.

1:29:45.044 --> 1:29:47.205
It's my main man Brennan.

1:30:43.602 --> 1:30:44.933
<i>Boats and ho's</i>

1:31:03.389 --> 1:31:04.947
<i>Boats and ho's</i>

1:31:52.471 --> 1:31:55.565
- You did it, Derek.
- I made a kite fly.

1:31:55.741 --> 1:31:59.233
Brennan, you're the best
big brother ever!

1:32:07.886 --> 1:32:11.583
- floor mats. The ones that match
the seats, and I kind of wanted...

1:32:11.757 --> 1:32:14.225
I traveled 500 miles
to give you my seed.

1:32:14.560 --> 1:32:16.585
Lumberjack!

1:32:57.036 --> 1:32:59.231
Rock the fuck
out of those drums, Dale!

1:32:59.405 --> 1:33:00.667
I'm sorry.

1:33:41.980 --> 1:33:44.744
- We're Prestige Worldwide!
- Prestige Worldwide!

1:33:44.917 --> 1:33:48.910
- Fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
- It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.

1:33:49.088 --> 1:33:51.989
It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.

1:33:52.324 --> 1:33:53.689
Brennan, that was sublime.

1:33:53.859 --> 1:33:56.157
Amazing.
We are so proud of you both.

1:33:56.328 --> 1:33:57.852
- Thank you.
- Incredible.

1:33:58.030 --> 1:33:59.190
- Thank you so much.
- Hey.

1:33:59.364 --> 1:34:03.266
So I made my quota.
Yeah, we sold a shit-ton of copters.

1:34:03.435 --> 1:34:05.528
- That's so good.
- Yeah.

1:34:05.704 --> 1:34:09.162
Look, I'm not great at
this Hallmark stuff...

1:34:09.341 --> 1:34:11.673
...but, Brennan,
when I look at you now...

1:34:11.844 --> 1:34:14.244
...I don't wanna kick you
in the head quite as much.

1:34:15.747 --> 1:34:17.044
Thanks, man.

1:34:17.216 --> 1:34:18.740
- That was beautiful.
- That was nice.

1:34:18.917 --> 1:34:20.282
Yeah.

1:34:21.153 --> 1:34:23.485
- What do we do now?
- We could hug.

1:34:23.655 --> 1:34:25.714
Yeah, you'd like that, faggot.
Sorry. I'm...

1:34:28.527 --> 1:34:30.051
Okay.

1:34:42.708 --> 1:34:44.642
- It's okay.
- Okay.

1:34:58.490 --> 1:35:01.482
- That's what we've been looking for.
- That's the ticket.

1:35:01.894 --> 1:35:03.191
It's fantastic.

1:35:03.362 --> 1:35:06.820
We've never done anything like that,
so you can't expect it to be perfect.

1:35:06.999 --> 1:35:08.023
It was good.

1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:09.929
- Felt good.
- Gotten close to a hug.

1:35:10.102 --> 1:35:14.300
- Hello, Brennan. Hi.
- Denise. Hey.

1:35:14.473 --> 1:35:17.237
Robert, Mom, Derek,
this is my girlfriend, Denise.

1:35:17.409 --> 1:35:20.503
- Hi. How are you?
- Actually, I'm his therapist.

1:35:20.679 --> 1:35:23.705
- We are in absolutely no way dating.
- Right.

1:35:23.882 --> 1:35:27.682
Brennan told me he was going to
hurl his body off a helicopter...

1:35:27.853 --> 1:35:30.048
...into shark-infested waters...

1:35:30.222 --> 1:35:32.622
...so I had a legal obligation
to be here.

1:35:32.791 --> 1:35:33.951
I get it.

1:35:34.126 --> 1:35:38.085
Don't wanna appear too eager,
and that is a good strategy too.

1:35:38.263 --> 1:35:40.390
You are an enabler.
You think you're helping...

1:35:40.566 --> 1:35:42.295
...but you're not.
- And you are a keeper.

1:35:42.467 --> 1:35:44.264
What'd you think?

1:35:45.204 --> 1:35:49.573
Brennan, I thought
you were incredibly brave.

1:35:49.741 --> 1:35:50.765
And I mean that...

1:35:50.943 --> 1:35:54.242
...in strictly the most clinical
and professional sense possible...

1:35:54.413 --> 1:35:57.849
...with no emotional,
intimate, sexual...

1:35:58.016 --> 1:36:00.644
...or any other undertones
that you could possibly infer.

1:36:00.852 --> 1:36:03.582
God, you're gonna make me cry.

1:36:04.156 --> 1:36:07.717
What poem is that from?
Is that James Joyce?

1:36:07.926 --> 1:36:09.587
Alice...

1:36:10.495 --> 1:36:12.554
...I like making sex with you.
- Yeah.

1:36:12.731 --> 1:36:16.497
I do. But you're also married.

1:36:16.902 --> 1:36:18.597
It's over.

1:36:19.605 --> 1:36:20.970
This is crazy. I'm a mother.

1:36:21.139 --> 1:36:23.835
I have two children,
I have a husband, a beautiful home.

1:36:24.009 --> 1:36:27.137
- I can't be fucking around with you.
- It was fun. It was fun, right?

1:36:27.312 --> 1:36:30.577
- It was fun while it lasted.
- I'm glad. All right, well, good luck.

1:36:32.818 --> 1:36:36.652
- No.
- Oh, my God, Dale!

1:36:36.822 --> 1:36:39.814
- Please don't leave me.
- Oh, my God. Look at that whale.

1:36:39.992 --> 1:36:41.516
Where?

1:36:44.663 --> 1:36:46.062
Dale!

1:36:52.037 --> 1:36:53.231
So I was with Seal...

1:36:53.405 --> 1:36:56.863
...and we were just taking a chopper
up to Everest base camp...

1:36:57.042 --> 1:36:59.203
...and the plot to my Sherpa...
- Derek. Derek.

1:36:59.911 --> 1:37:02.209
- Sorry. Okay.
- Remember, we talked about this.

1:37:02.714 --> 1:37:05.308
Dale, Brennan.
Tell me about the karaoke business.

1:37:05.651 --> 1:37:08.484
Really great, Dad.
Yeah. We call it Karaoke 'n' Roll.

1:37:09.187 --> 1:37:12.213
We got six bars, three restaurants,
and two more wanna sign up.

1:37:12.391 --> 1:37:14.382
- So it's booming.
- Fantastic.

1:37:14.559 --> 1:37:16.288
Most karaoke it's,
"Open to everyone.

1:37:16.461 --> 1:37:18.691
- Hey, just get up and have fun."
- Not you guys.

1:37:18.864 --> 1:37:21.196
If you can't sing, just sit down.
That's our motto.

1:37:21.366 --> 1:37:23.994
- It's the big leagues.
- You guys are doing so great.

1:37:24.169 --> 1:37:28.196
Guys, I have a little Christmas
surprise for Dale and Brennan.

1:37:29.207 --> 1:37:30.731
- You wanna see it?
- Yes!

1:37:30.909 --> 1:37:33.309
- You bet!
- Let's go look at it! Come on.

1:37:33.478 --> 1:37:35.070
- Don't peek.
- I smell cookies.

1:37:35.247 --> 1:37:37.112
Be patient. No, no. No, no.

1:37:38.483 --> 1:37:41.316
- Just a piñata, isn't it?
- Be patient. Be patient.

1:37:41.486 --> 1:37:43.386
- Be patient.
- Did you get me a tiger, Dad?

1:37:43.555 --> 1:37:44.613
Okay, open your eyes.

1:37:45.023 --> 1:37:46.047
Merry Christmas.

1:37:46.224 --> 1:37:47.885
Holy shit!

1:37:48.327 --> 1:37:51.558
Dad, I can't believe
you put the boat in the tree!

1:37:51.730 --> 1:37:52.856
This is amazing!

1:37:54.032 --> 1:37:57.331
<i>- It's The Gilded Lady. She lives!
- I can't believe it.</i>

1:37:57.502 --> 1:38:01.632
- How'd you get it up here?
- Oh, Robert, it's so great.

1:38:02.140 --> 1:38:04.005
- Pirate hats!
- Pirate hats!

1:38:07.479 --> 1:38:09.106
<i>- Hustlers!
- Hustlers!</i>

1:38:09.381 --> 1:38:11.474
Dad, that was so thoughtful!

1:38:13.618 --> 1:38:16.314
- Crossbows!
- Crossbows!

1:38:16.488 --> 1:38:19.423
You guys finally came to your senses
and got us something cool.

1:38:19.791 --> 1:38:22.055
You both know this is
completely fucked up, right?

1:38:22.227 --> 1:38:23.694
- Yeah.
- Of course.

1:38:23.995 --> 1:38:27.829
But Brennan sure can wear the shit
out of that pirate hat.

1:38:27.999 --> 1:38:30.866
- Chewbacca masks!
- Chewbacca masks!

1:38:34.506 --> 1:38:37.600
It's okay that mine's
not movie-quality.

1:39:03.668 --> 1:39:07.104
But he's like, "No, because you drove
my car last week, so I can't get it."

1:39:07.272 --> 1:39:11.231
So I'm like "You're gonna buy it for me
or I'm gonna sock you in the mouth."

1:39:19.484 --> 1:39:21.714
Oh, shit.

1:39:27.559 --> 1:39:31.188
Well, if it isn't Dale Doback
and his little butt buddy.

1:39:31.363 --> 1:39:33.388
Sticks and stones
may break my bones...

1:39:33.565 --> 1:39:37.057
...but I'm gonna kick you repeatedly
in the balls, Gardocki!

1:39:37.235 --> 1:39:39.635
Let's get them!

1:40:26.084 --> 1:40:28.814
- Where do you think you're going?
- Home.

1:40:28.987 --> 1:40:32.047
- We got something to show you.
- Come on.

1:40:32.757 --> 1:40:35.885
- You see that white dog crap?
- Do you see it?!

1:40:36.161 --> 1:40:38.425
- Yeah.
- Not too fun down there, is it?

1:40:38.597 --> 1:40:39.825
- No.
- You see?

1:40:39.998 --> 1:40:41.761
Your actions have consequences!

1:40:41.933 --> 1:40:46.802
When you oppress people,
they rise up in a fiery anger!

1:40:47.339 --> 1:40:48.567
Go home.

1:40:50.275 --> 1:40:53.574
We're not like you.
We're grown-ups, motherfucker!

1:40:53.745 --> 1:40:57.738
Say hi to your dad.
We went to high school together.

1:41:03.655 --> 1:41:06.021
The cops'll be here soon.

1:41:06.892 --> 1:41:09.417
I guess this is what it feels like
to be grown up.

1:41:09.594 --> 1:41:11.084
Hey.

1:41:11.596 --> 1:41:13.359
Can I ask you something?

1:41:13.532 --> 1:41:14.999
Yeah, of course.

1:41:15.166 --> 1:41:16.895
You know back when
you first moved in?

1:41:17.068 --> 1:41:18.092
Yeah.

1:41:18.270 --> 1:41:20.864
- Did you touch my drum set?
- No, I didn't.

1:41:21.039 --> 1:41:23.166
No, really, I won't get mad.
I just wanna know.

1:41:23.341 --> 1:41:25.241
No, I know.
You said you wouldn't get mad.

1:41:25.410 --> 1:41:28.106
I'm saying I didn't do it.
I didn't do it, I never did it.

1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:30.111
- Then I owe you an apology.
- No.

1:41:30.282 --> 1:41:31.407
No, you don't, at all.
No.

1:41:32.083 --> 1:41:34.551
Why wouldn't you take an apology
if you didn't do it?

1:41:34.719 --> 1:41:37.552
Just because I'm cool.
It doesn't matter.

1:45:18.243 --> 1:45:19.676
You got my passport.

1:45:20.812 --> 1:45:21.836
I'm good.

1:45:25.650 --> 1:45:28.619
Don't worry, not gonna be late.
Don't worry.
