I thought you might have
replaced that headstone

01:59.463 --> 02:02.204
I guess it makes it

my sister Amy's

Oh, it's always so lovely

02:07.956 --> 02:10.179

02:10.181 --> 02:13.305
And yet a painful reminder.

02:14.159 --> 02:16.687
Of our own mortality?

02:16.689 --> 02:19.531
I was thinking more of
the number of people

02:19.533 --> 02:21.251
I've put in the ground.

02:21.253 --> 02:25.551
Hell, I could fill

02:25.553 --> 02:27.718
I'm sure most of them
deserved it.

You put fresh flowers

From my garden.

02:37.227 --> 02:39.209
It seemed the least I could do.

02:39.211 --> 02:41.971
She would have appreciated it.

02:41.973 --> 02:43.922
I like to think so.

02:43.924 --> 02:46.551
I, however, will not.

02:46.553 --> 02:48.882
When I'm gone, I'm gone.

02:48.884 --> 02:50.667
No ceremony,

02:50.669 --> 02:51.941
no memorials,

02:51.943 --> 02:55.447
and absolutely no bringing
of flowers to my grave.

02:55.449 --> 02:56.356
Don't worry.

02:56.358 --> 02:57.596
There will be none of that.

02:57.598 --> 02:59.288
Good.

02:59.290 --> 03:02.156
From what I hear,
Granger is going to have you

03:02.158 --> 03:05.330
stuffed in a lifelike pose
for his office.

03:05.332 --> 03:07.297
Don't be cheeky.

03:07.299 --> 03:08.634
Though...

03:08.635 --> 03:10.680
I wouldn't put it past him.

03:12.147 --> 03:13.741
Come along, Mr. Callen.

03:13.743 --> 03:15.853
No rest for the wicked.

03:17.175 --> 03:19.075
Turn that punch on!

03:19.077 --> 03:21.315
And this is me on a camel,
on the way to Petra.

03:21.317 --> 03:22.218
Uh-huh, that's awesome.

03:22.219 --> 03:23.233
Power kick!

03:23.235 --> 03:25.624
You're not even
looking at it.

03:25.627 --> 03:26.711
Get your feet going.

03:26.713 --> 03:27.881
Yes. That is camel,

03:27.883 --> 03:29.001
and I think he likes you.

03:29.003 --> 03:30.171
What?
Power body!

03:30.173 --> 03:31.884
No, that's my foo

03:31.886 --> 03:33.581
I think
that's my foot.

03:33.584 --> 03:35.227
Ooh, wow, that is awkward.

03:35.229 --> 03:36.499
Moving on.

03:36.501 --> 03:39.181
This is the Wadi Mujib,
on the way to the Dead Sea.

03:39.183 --> 03:40.520
Get it out of my way.
I'm working out, Deeks.

03:40.523 --> 03:42.234
Uh, while I'm trying to
show you my vacation photos,

03:42.236 --> 03:43.456
which is more
than a little rude.

03:43.458 --> 03:44.813
Dude, I've seen them.
Nice job.

03:44.815 --> 03:46.035
Several times.
You e-mailed me every day.

03:46.037 --> 03:48.579
Well, maybe next time,
you should come with me.

03:48.581 --> 03:49.903
I've been to Jordan.
Okay.

03:49.905 --> 03:51.395
Well, then, we can
go someplace else.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.618
How about, say, for
instance, the Amazon?

03:53.620 --> 03:55.502
Or Norway, the land
of my forefathers?

03:55.504 --> 03:56.667
How about "no,"
Good work.

03:56.669 --> 03:57.884
because we work
together every day.

03:57.886 --> 03:59.584
Why would I want
to vacation with you, too?

03:59.586 --> 04:00.967
Because we're partners
and I'm awesome.

04:00.969 --> 04:03.551
Which is all the more reason
why I value our time apart.

04:03.552 --> 04:05.249
Whatever.
You totally missed me.

04:05.251 --> 04:06.616
Ha!

04:06.618 --> 04:08.248
You didn't give me
a chance to miss you, Deeks.

04:08.250 --> 04:09.799
Is that why you turned
your cell phone off?

04:09.801 --> 04:11.115
I turned my cell phone off

04:11.117 --> 04:12.447
because I was at a yoga retreat,

04:12.449 --> 04:13.997
and I needed to relax.

04:13.999 --> 04:15.798
Uh, wait a minute.
You don't do yoga.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.637
I do yoga, and you
mock me for it.

04:18.639 --> 04:20.841
That's because I do it
for spiritual centering.

04:20.844 --> 04:22.208
You, on the other hand,
do it to pick up chicks.

04:22.233 --> 04:23.314
So what you're saying is...

04:23.315 --> 04:25.468
you couldn't make a hook-up
even with a yoga dude?

04:25.470 --> 04:26.638
Okay.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.743
You know what?
I was asked to leave

04:28.745 --> 04:30.480
after the rescue helicopter
landed on the beach.

04:30.482 --> 04:31.648
I was worried about you.

04:31.650 --> 04:33.587
Thank you for that.

04:33.589 --> 04:35.274
Well, maybe you shouldn't have
turned your cell phone off.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.510
Ow!

04:36.512 --> 04:38.297
Hetty wants you guys up in Ops.

04:38.299 --> 04:39.466
Got a hot one.

04:39.468 --> 04:40.836
Nell, wait a second,
hold on, you got to see this.

04:40.838 --> 04:43.275
This is me
on a very excited camel,

04:43.277 --> 04:44.812
on the way to Petra... Nell?

04:44.814 --> 04:46.899
Nell?

04:46.901 --> 04:49.522
I got a... camel and a...

04:51.695 --> 04:52.947
I'm on a camel.

04:52.949 --> 04:54.220
Hey, Sam!

04:54.222 --> 04:55.894
How was your vay-cay?

04:55.896 --> 04:57.854
Uh...

04:57.856 --> 04:59.195
It was, uh...
it was good.

04:59.197 --> 05:00.232
It was short.

05:00.234 --> 05:02.460
Yep. Too short, but... good.

05:02.462 --> 05:04.067
Quality family time,
you know?

05:04.069 --> 05:05.860
You?
Um, awesome.

05:05.862 --> 05:06.982
I helped design and build

05:06.984 --> 05:09.578
a wind- and solar-powered
clinic in Guatemala,

05:09.580 --> 05:11.622
and still had
time to hit up

05:11.624 --> 05:14.620
a couple of ren faires, my lord.
Where's Nell?

05:14.622 --> 05:16.697
Uh, she's rallying the troops.
What do you need?

05:16.699 --> 05:19.155
A new chair.
That is your new chair.

05:19.157 --> 05:20.324
I want my old one.

05:21.144 --> 05:22.564
I-I thought it was broken.

05:22.566 --> 05:23.862
Yeah, it was broken in
the way I like it.

05:23.887 --> 05:24.672
Oh. Well...

05:24.673 --> 05:28.533
I mean, this chair is
ergonomically designed

05:28.535 --> 05:30.189
to improve posture,

05:30.191 --> 05:33.215
reduce fatigue and
increase productivity.

05:33.217 --> 05:35.639
So... um...

05:35.641 --> 05:39.434
plus, this baby's got over
25 points of adjustment, yo.

05:39.436 --> 05:41.407
Well, my butt only has
two points of adjustment,

05:41.409 --> 05:43.330
and they both want
my old chair back, yo.

05:43.332 --> 05:46.122
I-I think it's...
it's gone.

05:46.124 --> 05:48.128
Here, you know what?

05:48.130 --> 05:49.549
Here's what I'm
gonna do for you.

05:49.551 --> 05:51.003
I'm gonna put in a request

05:51.005 --> 05:53.896
and, uh, try to get you
a different chair.

05:53.898 --> 05:55.921
Where's my old chair?

05:55.923 --> 05:59.924
Well, you know, we donate
all of our old furniture

05:59.926 --> 06:02.165
to... to one of our charities,

06:02.167 --> 06:03.495
so if it's any consolation,

06:03.496 --> 06:05.055
it went to a good cause.

06:05.057 --> 06:06.151
It's not.

06:06.153 --> 06:07.513
Find out where they took it.

06:07.515 --> 06:09.174
I'll buy it back.

06:09.176 --> 06:10.203
It might be...

06:10.205 --> 06:11.830
in a container on a boat,

06:11.832 --> 06:14.371
on its way to a girl's school
in Gwandara, Nigeria.

06:14.373 --> 06:16.530
It might be?

06:16.532 --> 06:19.103
It... is.

06:20.998 --> 06:22.757
I'm... I'm sorry.

06:22.759 --> 06:24.285
I'm sorry, dude.
I just...

06:24.287 --> 06:25.531
You know what?

06:25.533 --> 06:28.081
I can get you a matching
lumbar pillow.

06:28.865 --> 06:30.814
Morning.
Morning.

06:30.816 --> 06:32.415
You look like
you got some sun.

06:32.417 --> 06:34.283
Yeah, I'm working undercover
at a tanning salon.

06:34.285 --> 06:35.967
Yeah, you wish.
Mm-hmm.

06:40.918 --> 06:43.784
Looks like somebody tried
to replace Sam's chair again.

06:43.786 --> 06:45.201
Really, Eric?

06:45.203 --> 06:48.119
It has over 25
points of adjustment.

06:48.121 --> 06:50.319
Not anymore!

06:51.321 --> 06:53.070
This is Adanan Al-Ahmadi.

06:53.072 --> 06:54.403
He's also known as...
Triple A.

06:54.405 --> 06:58.321
He's a bomb maker
for al-Qaeda, the Taliban,

06:58.323 --> 07:00.821
anybody else who's
willing to pay him.

07:00.823 --> 07:03.672
So he's an equal
opportunity exploder.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.039
No? All right.

07:07.041 --> 07:08.323
At least I'm trying.

07:08.325 --> 07:10.954
He narrowly escaped
a drone strike.

07:10.956 --> 07:13.405
When our people went in
to confirm the casualties,

07:13.407 --> 07:16.347
they found the remains of
several of his associates,

07:16.349 --> 07:18.423
including one who appeared
to be a Westerner.

07:18.425 --> 07:19.698
DNA analysis

07:19.700 --> 07:22.983
positively identified
the Westerner as an American.

07:22.985 --> 07:25.255
Not only was he an American;
he was a Marine.

07:25.257 --> 07:27.543
Counterintelligence Specialist
Gunnery Sergeant David Adams.

07:27.545 --> 07:28.882
Was he kidnapped?

07:28.884 --> 07:30.729
No.

07:30.731 --> 07:32.298
Wasn't even supposed
to be in the Middle East.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.572
His enlistment ended
18 months ago.

07:33.574 --> 07:34.682
So what's he doing

07:34.684 --> 07:36.641
back in Afghanistan
with known terrorists?

07:36.643 --> 07:38.552
That's what we
have to find out.

07:54.084 --> 07:55.666
Hetty already made arrangements

07:55.668 --> 07:57.757
for a Marine Corps rep
to meet us at the boatshed

07:57.759 --> 07:59.145
to tell us what they do know.

07:59.147 --> 08:00.256
Of course she has.

08:00.258 --> 08:02.379
According to his file,
Adams comes from

08:02.381 --> 08:04.158
a highly decorated
Marine family.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.982
Both his father and grandfather
were awarded the Silver Star.

08:06.984 --> 08:11.016
We really appreciate it.
Yep. Okay.

08:11.018 --> 08:12.861
- What's the family saying?
- Well, evidently,

08:12.863 --> 08:15.229
they're refusing to accept
he was even in Afghanistan,

08:15.231 --> 08:16.503
let alone dead.

08:16.505 --> 08:18.527
Perfect.

08:18.529 --> 08:20.014
Pick a number
between one and ten.

08:21.794 --> 08:23.396
Seven.
Four. Eight.

08:23.397 --> 08:25.354
Six. Five. Five or...
five or six.

08:25.356 --> 08:26.141
I really don't care.

08:26.143 --> 08:27.135
Why are we doing this?

08:27.137 --> 08:28.336
Doesn't matter.

08:28.338 --> 08:29.406
I'm gonna go back
with my original number,

08:29.407 --> 08:30.518
which is my lucky number,
which is four...

08:30.520 --> 08:33.232
point zero zero two six.

08:33.235 --> 08:34.938
The atomic weight of helium?

08:34.941 --> 08:36.230
You're good. She's good.

08:36.232 --> 08:38.083
Your favorite number
is the atomic weight of helium?

08:38.086 --> 08:39.315
And you call me a geek?

08:39.317 --> 08:41.422
Helium makes you talk funny.
Makes you think funny, too.

08:41.424 --> 08:42.938
You win, Deeks.
Number was four.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.370
Boom. What'd I say
about my lucky number?

08:44.372 --> 08:46.375
You two talk to the family,

08:46.377 --> 08:48.415
we're gonna speak to the Marine Corps.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

08:48.417 --> 08:49.882
Why do we got to speak
with the grieving family?

08:49.884 --> 08:50.892
That's not fair.
Sam's your partner.

08:50.894 --> 08:51.903
I could've said any number,

08:51.906 --> 08:53.033
and you would've
said I won.

08:53.035 --> 08:55.274
Come on, Einstein.

08:55.276 --> 08:57.011
I hate this game.

08:57.013 --> 08:58.140
<i>We've been tracking</i>

08:58.142 --> 09:00.380
Adanan Al-Ahmadi for months.

09:00.382 --> 09:02.816
Our intel was good,
but his was better.

09:02.818 --> 09:04.184
How so?

09:04.186 --> 09:06.987
He has an uncanny ability
to stay one step ahead of us.

09:06.989 --> 09:08.405
To the point
we started suspecting

09:08.407 --> 09:09.573
he had inside information.

09:09.575 --> 09:11.508
But you were never
able to prove it.

09:11.510 --> 09:12.710
Not until we recovered evidence

09:12.712 --> 09:14.294
from our last attempt
to get him.

09:14.296 --> 09:17.649
These are some of the notes
we recovered from the rubble.

09:17.651 --> 09:19.933
These are translations

09:19.935 --> 09:21.269
and intelligence evaluations,

09:21.271 --> 09:23.571
but basically they show
intimate knowledge

09:23.573 --> 09:25.555
of our operational procedures.

09:25.557 --> 09:27.644
Fortunately, the majority
of the information

09:27.646 --> 09:28.837
recovered was somewhat outdated,

09:28.839 --> 09:30.327
but it's all classified.

09:30.329 --> 09:31.537
It could only have
come from someone

09:31.539 --> 09:32.845
within one of our Marine units.

09:32.847 --> 09:34.801
And you think that someone
was David Adams?

09:34.803 --> 09:35.961
The man was killed

09:35.963 --> 09:37.982
in one of Adanan Al-Ahmadi's
safe houses

09:37.984 --> 09:39.473
with his jihadi poker buddies.

09:39.475 --> 09:41.958
Evidence doesn't get
much more damning than that.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.964
You said this information is outdated?
Yes.

09:43.966 --> 09:45.603
About 18 months.

09:45.605 --> 09:46.763
That's roughly the
same length of time

09:46.765 --> 09:47.807
since Adams was
in the Corps.

09:47.809 --> 09:49.929
But Adams never showed

09:49.931 --> 09:51.453
any indication of
this sort of behavior

09:51.455 --> 09:53.325
while in the Corps?
No, sir.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.396
From all reports,
he was a model Marine.

09:55.397 --> 09:57.112
So why turn traitor now?

09:57.114 --> 09:59.065
I only wish I could ask him
that myself, Agent Hanna.

09:59.067 --> 10:00.092
Perhaps we'll never know.

10:00.094 --> 10:02.128
I hate to think
that any American,

10:02.130 --> 10:03.457
let alone a fellow Marine,

10:03.459 --> 10:05.073
would compromise his country.

10:05.075 --> 10:07.463
But anyone who puts American
servicemen in jeopardy

10:07.465 --> 10:09.819
is an enemy of mine
and the United States.

10:11.385 --> 10:14.413
He was so proud to have
followed in his father's

10:14.415 --> 10:16.584
and his grandfather's
footsteps.

10:16.587 --> 10:17.645
I can imagine.

10:17.647 --> 10:18.991
My dad was a Marine, too.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.129
Do you have any idea why

10:21.131 --> 10:23.165
your son would go back
to Afghanistan?

10:23.167 --> 10:24.494
He wouldn't.

10:24.496 --> 10:25.703
And I don't believe he did.

10:25.705 --> 10:28.376
As much as he loved
serving his country,

10:28.378 --> 10:31.778
he was glad when his
last tour was over.

10:31.780 --> 10:33.447
He liked being a Marine,

10:33.449 --> 10:36.425
but he was eager to start
the next chapter of his life.

10:37.959 --> 10:40.034
Now, I know this must be
difficult for you,

10:40.036 --> 10:42.331
Mr. and Mrs. Adams, but...
You've lost a child?

10:42.333 --> 10:43.999
Brian...

10:48.034 --> 10:49.746
No.

10:49.748 --> 10:52.576
Then you have no idea.

10:55.408 --> 10:57.970
If I may, sir,
you have our deepest sympathies.

10:57.972 --> 11:00.468
But the DNA evidence
confirms that

11:00.470 --> 11:02.316
one of the casualties
in the drone attack

11:02.318 --> 11:03.481
was indeed David.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.889
Where's his body?

11:10.891 --> 11:12.969
His remains are being
flown back as we speak.

11:12.971 --> 11:14.118
Remains?

11:14.120 --> 11:15.667
So you have a body?

11:16.916 --> 11:18.446
I don't know the extent

11:18.449 --> 11:20.828
of what was recovered
from the attack site, sir.

11:20.830 --> 11:22.942
Did your son ever talk

11:22.944 --> 11:24.407
about his time in country?

11:24.409 --> 11:25.693
No.

11:25.695 --> 11:28.381
Most of what he did
was classified.

11:29.551 --> 11:31.875
All I cared about...

11:31.877 --> 11:35.255
was that he do his best
to keep himself safe

11:35.256 --> 11:37.645
and come home in one piece.

11:38.833 --> 11:41.304
- And he did.
- Which is precisely

11:41.306 --> 11:43.942
why he wouldn't go back,

11:43.944 --> 11:45.887
especially on his own.

11:45.889 --> 11:48.014
He has a good job
with the county.

11:48.016 --> 11:49.761
His loves his
girlfriend to death.

11:49.763 --> 11:52.959
He was even planning to go
back to school in the spring.

11:52.961 --> 11:54.823
Does that sound
like somebody

11:54.825 --> 11:56.602
who was going back
to Afghanistan?

11:56.604 --> 11:58.499
No, sir, it does not.

11:58.501 --> 12:01.005
But if it wasn't David
who was killed,

12:01.007 --> 12:03.148
where is your son?

12:10.485 --> 12:12.788
Tungsten.

12:12.790 --> 12:14.321
What's that?

12:14.323 --> 12:16.255
My favorite element--
it's tungsten.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.561
Number 74 on the
periodic table,

12:18.563 --> 12:20.883
and formerly
known as wolfram.

12:20.885 --> 12:22.852
Okay.

12:22.854 --> 12:24.636
It's got the highest
melting point

12:24.638 --> 12:27.311
and tensile strength
of any metal.

12:28.759 --> 12:30.576
Um, that's nice.

12:30.578 --> 12:32.276
Oh, come on.

12:33.151 --> 12:35.220
What's your
favorite element?

12:37.208 --> 12:40.067
Um, do you use this line
at the Genius Bar?

12:40.069 --> 12:41.268
No.

12:41.270 --> 12:43.073
I just thought you
might have a...

12:43.941 --> 12:46.028
You know what? Never mind.

12:48.916 --> 12:51.003
Ununoctium.
What?

12:51.005 --> 12:52.738
That's my favorite element.

12:52.740 --> 12:53.874
Uh, that's the stuff

12:53.876 --> 12:56.746
they mined on
Pandora in <i>Avatar.</i>

12:56.748 --> 12:58.416
No, um, that's unobtanium.

12:58.418 --> 13:00.102
This is ununoctium.

13:00.104 --> 13:01.638
It's element 118.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.608
There is no element 118.

13:03.610 --> 13:05.361
Flerov Laboratory
in Russia

13:05.363 --> 13:08.933
produced one atom
in 2002, two in 2005.

13:08.935 --> 13:10.369
It's quite rare.
Sorry.

13:10.371 --> 13:12.657
Must have missed that issue
of the <i>Periodic Times.</i>

13:14.045 --> 13:15.045
Ah, that's cool.

13:15.047 --> 13:16.464
Unun... Hello.

13:16.466 --> 13:18.784
Ununoctium.
No, no, no, look.

13:18.786 --> 13:20.634
Eight days ago,
David Adams took

13:20.636 --> 13:23.004
a Delta flight from
L.A. to Cincinnati.

13:23.006 --> 13:25.173
Next day,
he flies to New York,

13:25.175 --> 13:27.206
boards Alitalia from JFK

13:27.209 --> 13:30.015
first to Rome,
then to Madrid.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.410
From there, he takes
Brussels Airlines

13:31.412 --> 13:34.637
flight 3728
to Brussels.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.722
Did you even know that
Brussels has an airline?

13:36.724 --> 13:38.000
Of course.

13:38.002 --> 13:40.471
Okay. He then took
Czech Airlines

13:40.473 --> 13:43.432
flight 637
from Brussels to Prague,

13:43.434 --> 13:45.340
continues
on Turkish Airlines

13:45.342 --> 13:46.902
1768 to Istanbul,

13:46.904 --> 13:48.695
followed by
Saudi Arabian Airlines

13:48.697 --> 13:53.152
flight 264 to Riyadh
and, finally, Qatar Airways

13:53.154 --> 13:55.570
to Abu Dhabi,
with a stopover in Doha.

13:55.572 --> 13:57.083
Which means...

13:57.085 --> 13:59.567
He needs a new travel agent.

13:59.569 --> 14:01.244
Clearly, he was trying
to make it difficult,

14:01.246 --> 14:02.638
if not impossible,
to track his movements.

14:02.662 --> 14:04.008
But you did.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.520
Well done.

14:05.522 --> 14:07.608
Inform the others.

14:07.610 --> 14:08.940
You can run,
but you can't hide

14:08.942 --> 14:10.454
from Team Wolfram
and Ununoctium.

14:10.456 --> 14:11.655
What?!

14:11.657 --> 14:13.366
Hey-oh.

14:13.368 --> 14:15.602
That's our, uh,
favorite elements

14:15.604 --> 14:17.905
from the periodic table.

14:17.907 --> 14:19.323
Come on, Hetty.

14:19.325 --> 14:20.909
You must have a
favorite element.

14:20.911 --> 14:23.327
Scotch.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.497
<i>Dos tacos.</i>
<i>Gracias, Carlos.</i>

14:26.499 --> 14:28.316
<i>Y dos aguas. De nada, G.</i>

14:29.235 --> 14:31.485
Thank you.

14:32.788 --> 14:35.174
Oh, that's so good.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.309
You sure you're
not hungry?

14:39.845 --> 14:41.413
Not now.

14:41.415 --> 14:43.098
What the hell is that?

14:43.100 --> 14:44.633
Fish tacos.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.185
What kind of fish?

14:46.187 --> 14:48.480
The kind that swims
in the ocean.

14:48.482 --> 14:49.736
Mmm.

14:49.738 --> 14:50.958
How could you
eat something

14:50.960 --> 14:52.875
without even
knowing what it is?

14:52.877 --> 14:54.922
That could have been last week's
bait, for all you know.

14:54.924 --> 14:56.046
Even looks like chum.

14:56.048 --> 15:00.257
Carlos is the Iron Chef
of the food trucks.

15:01.331 --> 15:03.147
Smells good over here.
What's for lunch?

15:03.149 --> 15:03.822
Mystery fish.

15:03.847 --> 15:05.327
Oh, Deep Sea
Surprise is back?

15:05.328 --> 15:06.482
Help yourself.

15:06.484 --> 15:07.937
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.

15:07.939 --> 15:09.906
Nice.

15:09.908 --> 15:11.806
Sharesies?
No, thank you.

15:11.807 --> 15:12.817
And don't say "sharesies."

15:12.819 --> 15:14.594
All right.

15:14.597 --> 15:15.868
How'd you two make out?

15:15.870 --> 15:17.087
Parents are in denial.

15:17.089 --> 15:18.952
Their son worked at L.A.
County Beach and Harbor

15:18.954 --> 15:20.138
and has a girlfriend,
Mary Clark,

15:20.140 --> 15:22.090
who we are on our
way to go see now.

15:22.092 --> 15:23.241
This is delicious.

15:23.243 --> 15:24.931
Too bad you don't
know what it is.

15:24.933 --> 15:26.204
Sure, I do.

15:26.206 --> 15:29.428
It's a Lake Superior white fish.

15:29.430 --> 15:31.728
I'd say caught in a gill net.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.473
Probably two or three days ago.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.588
What?

15:35.590 --> 15:36.971
I'm a surfer--
I know my fish.

15:36.973 --> 15:38.291
Yeah, he's kind of
like a trained seal,

15:38.293 --> 15:40.437
only without the
"trained" part.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.774
- Or the "SEAL" part.
- So, why would David Adams

15:42.776 --> 15:44.236
go back to Afghanistan

15:44.238 --> 15:46.272
if it wasn't to work
for Adanan Al-Ahmadi?

15:46.274 --> 15:48.180
Maybe he left someone
over there.

15:48.182 --> 15:49.420
Maybe he met a woman.

15:49.422 --> 15:51.710
No, he already
had a girlfriend.

15:54.255 --> 15:55.256
I hate guys.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.417
Maybe it wasn't a girl.

15:56.419 --> 15:57.800
Maybe it was treasure.

15:57.802 --> 15:59.290
You watched <i>Goonies</i> again,
didn't you?

15:59.293 --> 16:00.319
No.

16:00.321 --> 16:01.624
Maybe.
There it is.

16:01.626 --> 16:02.772
What? It's a great movie.

16:02.774 --> 16:03.938
Deeks could be right.

16:03.940 --> 16:05.636
It's a good movie,
not a great movie.

16:05.638 --> 16:07.538
No, no, about the treasure--
or something like it.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.254
Adams had access
to a lot of intel.

16:09.256 --> 16:10.917
Wouldn't be the first
person to go back

16:10.919 --> 16:12.426
and try and profit
from his time overseas.

16:12.428 --> 16:13.660
So, what are
you thinking?

16:13.662 --> 16:15.255
Um, drugs? Weapons?

16:15.257 --> 16:16.740
Stolen antiquities?

16:17.583 --> 16:18.775
You got something
for us, Eric?

16:18.777 --> 16:20.275
We found proof that David Adams

16:20.277 --> 16:21.638
flew to Dubai
eight days ago.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.827
There's no evidence of how
he got into Afghanistan

16:23.829 --> 16:26.106
once he got there,
but we're still looking.

16:26.108 --> 16:28.341
He also received
a $2,500 deposit

16:28.343 --> 16:30.545
into his bank account
a week before he left.

16:30.547 --> 16:32.841
It also originated
in Dubai.

16:32.843 --> 16:33.806
Blood money?

16:33.807 --> 16:34.847
Looks that way.

16:34.849 --> 16:36.377
Okay, thanks, guys.

16:36.379 --> 16:39.178
I guess treason doesn't pay
what it used to.

16:53.170 --> 16:55.416
I like hiring guys and gals
with military experience.

16:55.418 --> 16:56.856
They're good at
taking orders.

16:56.858 --> 16:59.059
Usually got their act
together, especially Marines.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.605
Besides, it's nice to
give a little something

17:00.607 --> 17:02.089
back to the guys who
served, you know?

17:02.091 --> 17:03.535
What can you tell us
about David Adams?

17:03.561 --> 17:04.617
He's a good kid.

17:04.617 --> 17:06.355
Hard worker.
Knew his way around the water,

17:06.357 --> 17:08.011
so I put him
on the dredging project.

17:08.012 --> 17:09.512
Doing what?
Anything that needed to be done.

17:09.515 --> 17:11.304
Army Corps of Engineers
is taking

17:11.306 --> 17:12.821
over a million cubic yards
of sand

17:12.824 --> 17:14.357
out of the Marina del Rey
channel.

17:14.358 --> 17:15.604
Big job.

17:15.606 --> 17:17.310
Unfortunately, I got
20 more miles of beach

17:17.311 --> 17:19.238
and a couple dozen other marinas
to deal with.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.518
He ever mention
anything

17:20.520 --> 17:22.146
to you about going back
to Afghanistan?

17:22.173 --> 17:23.453
Afghanistan?

17:23.454 --> 17:25.500
Thought he was going to Oregon.

17:26.354 --> 17:27.837
He told you he was leaving?

17:27.839 --> 17:28.879
Yeah, he put his

17:28.881 --> 17:30.448
two-week notice in
about a month back.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.472
He was real apologetic.

17:31.474 --> 17:33.520
Said he got a job
offer up north.

17:33.522 --> 17:35.318
I could have swore
he said Oregon.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.911
What kind of job?
Logging.

17:36.913 --> 17:38.026
It's tough work,

17:38.027 --> 17:39.570
but they were paying
a lot more money.

17:39.572 --> 17:40.811
He needed it
for school.

17:40.813 --> 17:43.868
You sure we're talking
about the same kid?

17:45.095 --> 17:47.306
Maybe it's time we talked
to somebody he served with.

17:47.308 --> 17:48.755
<i>Oh, look at this.</i>

17:48.757 --> 17:50.204
Check that out.
That's my favorite.

17:50.206 --> 17:51.860
Deeks, I'm driving.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.101
<i>We're in a parking lot.</i>

17:53.103 --> 17:54.095
<i>You're pulling over.</i>

17:54.097 --> 17:55.170
Yeah, to let you out.

17:55.172 --> 17:56.612
Next time,
I won't slow down.

17:56.614 --> 17:59.724
Okay, you have to admit, though,
I am rocking that turban.

17:59.726 --> 18:01.827
I look like
Lawrence of Arabia.

18:01.829 --> 18:03.764
Hmm?

18:03.766 --> 18:05.253
Okay, that's a kaffiyeh,
not a turban,

18:05.255 --> 18:06.908
and you seriously look
like you're in drag.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.168
Touché.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.882
Okay, that is mildly amusing,

18:10.884 --> 18:13.482
but you can't say "touché."

18:13.484 --> 18:14.641
Think I just did.

18:14.643 --> 18:16.066
Yeah, but it was
inappropriate.

18:16.068 --> 18:17.853
I'm the one that's
supposed to say "touché."

18:17.855 --> 18:19.376
I can say "touché"
if I want.

18:19.378 --> 18:20.585
Yeah, you can say it,

18:20.587 --> 18:21.810
but it doesn't make
any sense.

18:21.812 --> 18:23.019
All right,
if I say something

18:23.021 --> 18:24.840
and you say something
witty in return,

18:24.842 --> 18:26.827
which, by the way,
is highly unlikely--

18:26.829 --> 18:29.095
let's just say for the sake
of argument that you do,

18:29.097 --> 18:31.264
perhaps by accident--
then, and only then,

18:31.266 --> 18:32.737
would I say "touché."

18:32.739 --> 18:35.156
Yeah, see, I think you're just
mad that I beat you to it.

18:35.158 --> 18:36.430
That's not how
it works, all right?

18:36.432 --> 18:37.789
Only the person
being bested says "touché."

18:37.791 --> 18:39.150
Really?
All right, you know what?

18:39.152 --> 18:41.015
Let me just drop
some knowledge on you

18:41.017 --> 18:42.585
for a second, all right?
It's French.

18:42.587 --> 18:44.504
It comes from fencing.
It means "to touch."

18:44.506 --> 18:46.072
So, if I were
to touch you

18:46.074 --> 18:48.776
with my sword,
then you would say "touché."

18:48.778 --> 18:50.850
Then I wouldn't say it
because you ain't

18:50.852 --> 18:53.519
never touching me
with your sword, Zorro.

18:53.521 --> 18:54.686
Wow, that just happened.

18:54.688 --> 18:57.302
Fair enough.
Okay, that was a touché.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.692
Okay. Touché.
But you don't get to say it!

18:59.694 --> 19:01.069
Touché, touché, touché.

19:01.071 --> 19:03.422
Yeah, it's like teaching
semantics to a dolphin.

19:03.424 --> 19:05.254
Yes?

19:05.256 --> 19:07.343
Hi, Miss Clark.
This is Agent Blye

19:07.345 --> 19:08.939
and Detective Deeks, NCIS.

19:08.941 --> 19:10.914
We spoke on the phone.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.217
I'll be right there.
Okay.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.748
♪ Touché, touché ♪

19:14.750 --> 19:16.968
♪ You cannot
touch my touché. ♪

19:16.970 --> 19:18.647
Okay, that's a human
resources violation,

19:18.649 --> 19:21.378
which is going
in my report to Hetty.

19:22.812 --> 19:24.191
Really?

19:24.193 --> 19:26.676
David's parents told me
you spoke with them.

19:26.678 --> 19:28.189
They don't think
it's true, either.

19:28.191 --> 19:30.049
We wish it wasn't,

19:30.051 --> 19:31.859
but, unfortunately,
all the evidence

19:31.861 --> 19:33.800
points at David being dead.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.522
It's Callen.

19:38.524 --> 19:40.464
Excuse me.

19:40.466 --> 19:42.474
But it could be a mistake.

19:42.476 --> 19:44.007
We don't think so.

19:44.009 --> 19:46.100
But at this point,
anything you can tell us

19:46.102 --> 19:47.829
is going to help us
learn the truth.

19:47.831 --> 19:49.477
So can you think
of any reason

19:49.479 --> 19:51.372
why David would go
back to Afghanistan?

19:51.374 --> 19:52.689
No.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.205
He wouldn't do that.

19:54.207 --> 19:56.117
But he did.

19:56.119 --> 19:58.210
I'm sorry.

19:58.212 --> 20:00.022
It just doesn't make any sense.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.950
Okay, thanks.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.520
So, according to his boss,

20:04.522 --> 20:06.979
David quit working
for the county two weeks ago.

20:06.981 --> 20:09.014
Yes, he got a new job
in Alaska.

20:09.016 --> 20:10.404
Doing what?

20:10.406 --> 20:12.490
Working for an oil company.

20:12.492 --> 20:14.355
I just talked
to him Thursday,

20:14.357 --> 20:15.626
and everything was fine.

20:15.628 --> 20:17.984
You spoke to him on the
phone five days ago?

20:17.985 --> 20:19.357
We Skyped.

20:19.359 --> 20:20.865
He said that he
was going

20:20.867 --> 20:22.612
into the interior
the next morning

20:22.614 --> 20:23.715
on some geological surveys,

20:23.717 --> 20:25.444
and that he would call
or e-mail me

20:25.446 --> 20:27.140
whenever his crew
got to someplace

20:27.142 --> 20:29.446
where they had cell
or Internet service,

20:29.448 --> 20:31.284
but he didn't know
how long that would be.

20:31.286 --> 20:32.647
Do you have the name

20:32.648 --> 20:34.699
and number of the company
he was working for?

20:34.701 --> 20:36.094
Yes.

20:36.096 --> 20:37.981
Why would he
switch jobs?

20:37.983 --> 20:39.868
It was more money.

20:39.870 --> 20:41.985
They even gave him
a signing bonus.

20:41.987 --> 20:44.547
Why wouldn't he tell his parents
that he was going away?

20:45.729 --> 20:47.665
He was waiting.

20:47.667 --> 20:50.018
Waiting for what?

20:51.095 --> 20:53.262
The right time.

20:54.389 --> 20:57.112
I'm pregnant.

20:58.844 --> 21:01.347
And David thought that we
would need more money now,

21:01.349 --> 21:03.213
especially
if he was going to try

21:03.215 --> 21:05.264
and go back to school.

21:09.853 --> 21:13.802
You served two tours
in Afghanistan with David Adams?

21:13.804 --> 21:16.105
Yes, sir.

21:16.107 --> 21:18.676
How would you
describe him?

21:18.678 --> 21:21.517
Squared away
with sharp corners, sir.

21:21.519 --> 21:23.972
Smart, tough, reliable.

21:23.974 --> 21:25.735
A damn fine Marine.

21:25.738 --> 21:28.039
When was the last time
you spoke with him?

21:28.041 --> 21:29.603
Probably about a
month or so ago.

21:29.605 --> 21:31.451
I tried to convince him
to come work

21:31.453 --> 21:33.115
at Homeland Security with me.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.646
He wasn't interested?

21:34.648 --> 21:36.528
He was trying to get
into law school.

21:36.530 --> 21:38.512
Any reason
you can think of

21:38.514 --> 21:40.276
that he'd go back
to Afghanistan?

21:40.278 --> 21:42.327
Not really.

21:42.329 --> 21:44.545
Unless it was
a humanitarian effort.

21:44.547 --> 21:46.521
Why would he lie about that?

21:46.523 --> 21:47.607
No reason.

21:47.609 --> 21:49.172
No reason,
I guess, but...

21:49.174 --> 21:50.637
he was very sympathetic

21:50.639 --> 21:52.284
to the plight
of the Afghani people.

21:52.286 --> 21:54.917
Sympathetic enough
to betray his country?

21:54.919 --> 21:56.498
No, David wasn't a traitor,

21:56.500 --> 21:58.869
but... but he did believe

21:58.871 --> 22:01.141
that the Afghani people,
they needed our help.

22:01.143 --> 22:02.985
And he talked about that

22:02.987 --> 22:05.422
a lot.

22:05.424 --> 22:07.612
Maybe he thought
he was helping them.

22:08.848 --> 22:12.584
If David did go back
to Afghanistan

22:12.586 --> 22:13.984
without telling anyone,

22:13.986 --> 22:17.836
my first guess would be
that he's working for the CIA.

22:22.957 --> 22:26.957
Well, Langley swears

22:26.959 --> 22:31.073
that David Adams was not working
for the CIA.

22:31.075 --> 22:32.999
So, if he's
in Afghanistan

22:33.001 --> 22:34.317
with known terrorists

22:34.319 --> 22:35.994
and he's not
working for us...

22:35.996 --> 22:38.007
He's working for someone else.

22:38.009 --> 22:39.902
Which is the same thing
as working against us.

22:39.904 --> 22:41.581
Mm-hmm.

22:41.583 --> 22:43.108
So, I think we found something.

22:43.110 --> 22:44.970
I've been in contact

22:44.972 --> 22:47.452
with every humanitarian
and charitable organization

22:47.454 --> 22:50.221
operating in Afghanistan,
none of which know David Adams.

22:50.223 --> 22:52.016
No surprise there.

22:52.018 --> 22:54.750
The oil company which he was
supposedly working for in Alaska

22:54.752 --> 22:56.126
never heard of him, either.

22:56.128 --> 22:58.139
But we were able
to access his e-mail account

22:58.141 --> 22:59.570
with the info
his girlfriend provided,

22:59.572 --> 23:00.770
and that's where
it gets interesting.

23:00.772 --> 23:01.890
We found a bunch

23:01.892 --> 23:04.192
of correspondence
with a company called

23:04.194 --> 23:06.330
Atama Security
& Protection.

23:06.332 --> 23:08.156
They're a private security
firm that operates

23:08.158 --> 23:10.492
around the globe,
including the Middle East.

23:10.494 --> 23:12.039
They hired David
three weeks ago.

23:12.041 --> 23:14.391
It makes sense-- high pay
for a dangerous job.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.150
He doesn't want his parents
and his girlfriend

23:16.152 --> 23:17.548
to worry, so he lies,

23:17.550 --> 23:19.441
says he's going to Alaska
where he can't be reached.

23:19.443 --> 23:20.641
But why wouldn't
the security company

23:20.643 --> 23:21.826
notify someone he was missing?

23:21.828 --> 23:23.356
Maybe they didn't
know about it.

23:23.358 --> 23:26.103
Or they did know and
considered it bad for business.

23:26.105 --> 23:27.569
Did you guys call?

23:27.571 --> 23:29.340
Yes. They said it was against
company policy

23:29.342 --> 23:30.942
to reveal information about
their employees' whereabouts

23:30.944 --> 23:31.998
for their own safety.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.379
It's too late for that.

23:33.381 --> 23:34.520
The dude's dead.

23:34.522 --> 23:36.498
Yeah, they said they'd look
into it

23:36.500 --> 23:39.513
and get back to us.
Great.

23:39.515 --> 23:41.046
Yeah, that's not
going to happen.

23:41.048 --> 23:46.602
I need you to turn the heat up
on Atama Security.

23:55.327 --> 23:57.405
Place is empty.
Where is everybody?

23:57.407 --> 23:59.620
Check out these posters.

24:00.831 --> 24:02.857
Is the security by Abercrombie?

24:02.859 --> 24:06.573
Guys couldn't protect
a frat party.

24:06.575 --> 24:09.947
Federal agents! Anyone here!

24:09.949 --> 24:11.496
Hello?

24:11.498 --> 24:13.936
You work here?

24:17.038 --> 24:18.422
Nice customer service
there, huh?

24:18.424 --> 24:20.235
Federal agents!
Throw down your weapon!

24:21.358 --> 24:23.583
Who taught this guy
to shoot, Deeks?

24:23.585 --> 24:26.270
That's funny
till he wings one of us.

24:26.272 --> 24:28.315
How many shots was that?
Seven.

24:28.317 --> 24:29.568
How many you think
he's got left?

24:29.570 --> 24:31.233
Not enough.
Give him something to shoot at.

24:31.235 --> 24:32.619
You give him something
to shoot at.

24:32.621 --> 24:34.382
It's your turn to be the decoy.

24:34.384 --> 24:36.229
Pick a number
between one and ten.

24:36.231 --> 24:38.010
Get out of here.

24:57.303 --> 24:58.267
G?!

24:58.269 --> 25:00.137
I'm good.

25:04.693 --> 25:06.362
"Game over."

25:06.364 --> 25:08.309
No doubt.

25:21.938 --> 25:23.313
Danny Levian.

25:23.314 --> 25:24.876
You're a long
way from home.

25:24.877 --> 25:25.842
I live in Glendale.

25:25.844 --> 25:27.681
With your relatives.

25:27.683 --> 25:29.933
You're on student visa
from Yerevan, Armenia.

25:29.935 --> 25:32.309
Your aunt and uncle know you're
working with the Taliban?

25:32.311 --> 25:34.354
Or is it al-Qaeda?

25:34.356 --> 25:37.472
I work
for Atama Security.

25:37.474 --> 25:39.295
Which is a terrorist front.

25:39.297 --> 25:40.403
What? I don't know

25:40.405 --> 25:42.226
what the hell
you're talking about, man.

25:42.228 --> 25:44.749
I just answer the phones.
And shoot at people.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.674
Which, in this case,
is attempted murder

25:46.676 --> 25:47.781
on two federal agents.

25:47.783 --> 25:49.179
Wait. Hold on.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.458
You broke in, all right?

25:50.460 --> 25:52.388
I thought you were gonna
kill me and rob the place.

25:52.390 --> 25:53.759
What do you expect me to do?

25:53.761 --> 25:54.997
Try again.
The door was unlocked.

25:54.999 --> 25:56.616
Where are your coworkers?

25:58.102 --> 26:00.693
Most days, it's only me
answering the phones.

26:00.695 --> 26:03.582
One time, another guy was there
interviewing somebody,

26:03.584 --> 26:05.893
but I haven't seen him
in a week or so.

26:05.895 --> 26:07.015
You got a name?

26:07.017 --> 26:08.121
Mr. Jones.

26:10.897 --> 26:13.388
I-I only work there
part-time, okay?

26:13.390 --> 26:14.774
I swear. You can check.

26:14.776 --> 26:17.498
I'm a student
at Santa Monica College.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.265
Yeah, not a very good one.

26:19.267 --> 26:21.245
You've got a, uh...

26:21.247 --> 26:24.464
you got a C in
American Cinema.

26:24.466 --> 26:26.726
Who gets a C in a
film studies class?

26:26.728 --> 26:28.182
All you do is
watch movies.

26:29.284 --> 26:30.450
It's just an elective.

26:30.452 --> 26:31.636
That's the spirit.

26:31.638 --> 26:33.430
I think he broke my jaw, man.

26:33.432 --> 26:36.138
You're lucky he didn't break
your neck.

26:36.140 --> 26:37.494
Day's not over yet.

26:39.221 --> 26:41.133
You know this guy?

26:41.134 --> 26:43.146
No. Who is he?

26:43.148 --> 26:45.230
You tell us. He works
for your company.

26:45.232 --> 26:47.599
I told you,
I just answer the phones.

26:47.601 --> 26:49.005
Yeah?

26:49.007 --> 26:51.579
Well, let me give you
a hint-- he was killed

26:51.581 --> 26:53.237
in a drone attack
with some other

26:53.239 --> 26:54.625
high-profile terrorists
a few days ago.

26:54.627 --> 26:57.080
Look, Danny, you seem
like a smart kid.

26:57.082 --> 26:59.943
No, he doesn't.

26:59.945 --> 27:01.548
You really don't, but...

27:01.550 --> 27:03.203
we're gonna give you a
chance to do something

27:03.205 --> 27:05.685
really smart which may
actually save your ass.

27:05.687 --> 27:07.289
Right now, our
forensics computer team

27:07.291 --> 27:10.038
are about to rip through every
byte of your personal history,

27:10.040 --> 27:11.693
including that of
Atama Security.

27:11.695 --> 27:13.843
They find even the
slightest link

27:13.845 --> 27:17.517
between you
and this man,

27:17.519 --> 27:20.744
well, I shudder to think
of the consequences,

27:20.746 --> 27:23.640
and I seldom shudder.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.378
It's true.

27:28.324 --> 27:30.127
I've never seen him shudder.

27:46.775 --> 27:48.379
Don't even think

27:48.381 --> 27:50.497
about trying to hide
something from us.

27:50.499 --> 27:53.178
You ready?

27:53.180 --> 27:56.438
We're gonna tear this place
some new inodes.

27:56.440 --> 27:57.729
I did their Web design

27:57.731 --> 28:00.293
and process the job
applications, okay?

28:00.295 --> 28:02.412
I have no idea
what happens after that.

28:02.414 --> 28:04.183
What happens after that

28:04.185 --> 28:06.136
is a whole lot of
stolen information.

28:06.138 --> 28:08.816
Prospective employees give up
tons of personal details,

28:08.818 --> 28:10.659
like Social Security numbers,

28:10.660 --> 28:12.466
banking details,
all under the guise

28:12.468 --> 28:13.756
of security
background checks.

28:13.758 --> 28:16.887
Dozens of applicants
have reported identity theft.

28:16.889 --> 28:21.174
Even if Atama Security
is a scam,

28:21.176 --> 28:25.528
it doesn't explain why
David Adams was in Afghanistan.

28:25.530 --> 28:28.040
Yeah, but scam or no scam,
somebody's bankrolling it.

28:28.042 --> 28:29.278
You know what they say.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.668
When in doubt...

28:30.670 --> 28:33.767
Follow the money.

28:35.358 --> 28:38.287
Mmm, nice to get out
for a change, huh?

28:38.289 --> 28:41.386
You know, sometimes I think
Hetty makes us stay in Ops

28:41.388 --> 28:43.647
just so she can
keep an eye on us.

28:43.649 --> 28:47.497
Like we're gonna get in trouble
out in the field.

28:47.499 --> 28:49.640
Nell?

28:51.316 --> 28:53.677
Uh, Nell?

28:56.341 --> 28:59.554
Intelligence Analyst
Nell Jones, NCIS?

29:07.844 --> 29:09.517
Hello?

29:11.579 --> 29:14.122
Is, uh...

29:14.124 --> 29:17.561
is anyone else here?

29:21.573 --> 29:23.175
NCIS Ops.

29:23.177 --> 29:24.321
Hey, it's Eric for Hetty.

29:24.323 --> 29:25.418
Who is this?

29:25.420 --> 29:26.482
Eric.

29:26.484 --> 29:27.922
Eric who?

29:27.924 --> 29:28.905
Beale.

29:28.907 --> 29:30.050
What are you doing?

29:31.017 --> 29:33.685
Um, hi, hi.

29:33.687 --> 29:35.453
What's up?
I was...

29:35.454 --> 29:36.517
No, no, never mind.

29:36.519 --> 29:38.350
Um, I was just, um...
I was just, uh...

29:38.352 --> 29:39.577
Just have her call me back.

29:39.579 --> 29:40.560
Okay, bye-bye.

29:40.562 --> 29:43.588
Hey.
Wow!

29:43.590 --> 29:45.062
Is there a problem here?

29:45.064 --> 29:47.107
No. Why? Is there?

29:47.109 --> 29:49.449
I don't know. Why do I feel

29:49.450 --> 29:51.249
like you're acting weirder
than normal?

29:51.251 --> 29:53.561
No. Weird? I'm not weird.
You're weird.

29:53.563 --> 29:55.383
No, you're not weird.
I mean, it's like...

29:55.385 --> 29:58.251
it's like... this is weird
that you're asking me.

29:58.253 --> 29:59.382
Where were you?

29:59.384 --> 30:01.508
I was tapping into their
phone lines, remember?

30:01.510 --> 30:02.892
Right.

30:02.894 --> 30:05.962
Yeah. Um, are you sure
that you're okay?

30:05.964 --> 30:07.987
Yeah, yeah.
I'm awesome.

30:07.989 --> 30:08.914
Yeah.

30:08.916 --> 30:11.749
Okay.

30:11.751 --> 30:13.589
Hey, um, are you strapped?

30:13.591 --> 30:15.967
Excuse me?

30:15.969 --> 30:17.637
Packing? Carrying heat?

30:17.639 --> 30:19.493
I'm sorry, I...

30:19.495 --> 30:21.365
Do you have a gun?

30:21.367 --> 30:24.600
Yes, I have
my service weapon. Why?

30:24.602 --> 30:27.290
Good. No, I'm just checking.
Just checking.

30:28.346 --> 30:32.652
Wolfram, you're
safe with me.

30:38.832 --> 30:42.951
We should... get at it.

30:44.058 --> 30:46.525
Uh, at work.
We should.

30:46.527 --> 30:49.215
Yeah, we should
probably get busy...

30:49.217 --> 30:52.024
doing stuff...

30:52.026 --> 30:55.070
that we were doing.

30:55.072 --> 30:58.067
Okay.

31:04.452 --> 31:06.833
These four are all employees
of Atama Security,

31:06.835 --> 31:09.081
and they all have
two things in common.

31:09.083 --> 31:10.528
All former military?

31:10.530 --> 31:11.940
Correct.

31:11.942 --> 31:13.798
And the other?

31:13.800 --> 31:14.799
They're all missing.

31:14.801 --> 31:17.213
None of their families
know where they are.

31:17.215 --> 31:19.865
They all follow the same
basic pattern as David Adams.

31:19.867 --> 31:22.279
They were all hired
by Atama Security,

31:22.281 --> 31:24.645
wired money prior
to leaving the country,

31:24.647 --> 31:25.964
and never heard from
after reaching Dubai.

31:25.966 --> 31:27.583
That's a more
than two things in common.

31:27.585 --> 31:29.759
Even though Atama Security
purports to be

31:29.761 --> 31:31.189
a decades-old global company,

31:31.191 --> 31:33.014
we can't find any evidence
of their existence

31:33.016 --> 31:34.603
dating back more
than three months.

31:34.605 --> 31:36.745
And I'm still not sure
where they're actually based

31:36.747 --> 31:38.620
because everything's
being routed through

31:38.622 --> 31:41.766
a proxy-mix cascade
in Curacao.

31:41.768 --> 31:44.476
Ah, of course, Dutch Antilles.
What?

31:44.479 --> 31:46.485
The economy's tough.
People need work.

31:46.487 --> 31:49.881
They're willing to give up
tons of personal information

31:49.884 --> 31:51.204
in hopes
of getting a job.

31:51.206 --> 31:53.732
Even if Atama Security
is a glorified phishing scam

31:53.734 --> 31:56.493
for identity theft,
someone wired these five guys

31:56.495 --> 31:58.335
money and plane tickets.

31:58.337 --> 32:00.509
Why?

32:01.967 --> 32:04.860
How many job applications
did Atama Security receive?

32:04.862 --> 32:06.015
Hundreds.

32:06.017 --> 32:07.421
Only these guys
were hired.

32:07.423 --> 32:09.947
All military,
all missing.

32:09.949 --> 32:11.220
Dubai's an easy point of entry.

32:11.222 --> 32:13.998
And they probably signed a bogus
confidentiality agreement

32:14.000 --> 32:15.410
so no one knows
where they're going.

32:15.412 --> 32:17.873
David Adams ended up
in Afghanistan with Al-Ahmadi.

32:19.630 --> 32:21.904
Okay, do you two have
something you want

32:21.906 --> 32:24.414
to share with the
rest of the group?

32:24.416 --> 32:27.159
Atama Security is stealing
more than identities.

32:27.161 --> 32:29.073
They're stealing people,

32:29.075 --> 32:31.536
specifically former
military personnel.

32:31.538 --> 32:33.417
It's a honey pot.

32:33.419 --> 32:34.610
They offer them a good job.

32:34.611 --> 32:36.398
They even give them
a $2,500 signing bonus.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.563
They fly them overseas
and hand them off

32:38.565 --> 32:40.994
to guys like Al-Ahmadi.

32:40.996 --> 32:42.375
Unfortunately, you're wrong
about one thing.

32:42.376 --> 32:44.916
These aren't the only five
they've hired.

32:44.918 --> 32:46.674
They're just the only ones
who were reported missing.

32:46.676 --> 32:50.877
They've hired
at least six others.

32:50.879 --> 32:52.915
There could be more.

33:07.709 --> 33:10.391
Of the six new hires, only
two have already left.

33:10.393 --> 33:12.553
Jennifer Lee arrives in
Madrid in a few hours

33:12.555 --> 33:14.254
before continuing
on to Turkey.

33:14.256 --> 33:16.219
Okay, we can have
Interpol intercept her

33:16.221 --> 33:17.704
at the airport in Madrid.

33:17.706 --> 33:18.910
What about this guy?

33:18.912 --> 33:22.493
Unfortunately, John Harris
arrives in Dubai tomorrow.

33:22.495 --> 33:24.508
Dubai?

33:24.510 --> 33:26.670
And you're going
to do this with

33:26.672 --> 33:29.098
the blessing of the Emir,
of course?

33:29.100 --> 33:31.145
We were kind of hoping
to get in and out

33:31.147 --> 33:32.234
before anybody
really noticed.

33:32.236 --> 33:35.173
And I was hoping to be living

33:35.175 --> 33:38.920
on a quiet vineyard
in Saint Emilion by now.

33:38.922 --> 33:40.539
Well, if this goes wrong,
you'll get that chance.

33:40.541 --> 33:41.563
And you might get the chance

33:41.565 --> 33:43.874
to see the inside
of an Emirate prison.

33:43.876 --> 33:45.806
Won't be the first time.

33:45.808 --> 33:48.001
No, but it might be
your last.

33:48.003 --> 33:52.708
What am I supposed to say
to Assistant Director Granger

33:52.710 --> 33:56.372
if he decides to grace us
with a surprise visit?

33:56.374 --> 33:57.881
Hetty, we've already
lost one American.

33:57.883 --> 33:59.244
Four others are missing--

33:59.247 --> 34:01.025
five if we don't intercept
this next one.

34:01.027 --> 34:02.877
All of whom are probably
being torted right now

34:02.879 --> 34:04.731
for information
on our military operations,

34:04.733 --> 34:06.547
assuming they're not
already dead.

34:06.549 --> 34:09.563
All the more reason
not to rush into this.

34:09.567 --> 34:11.926
If it goes bad,
we'll blame it on Mossad.

34:11.928 --> 34:13.688
Oh, not funny.

34:13.690 --> 34:15.596
It's a little
bit funny.

34:15.598 --> 34:18.186
A little.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.426
What the hell.

34:22.428 --> 34:23.721
Oh, Mr. Beale,

34:23.723 --> 34:25.664
would you make
arrangements

34:25.666 --> 34:27.929
for our team
to get to Dubai

34:27.931 --> 34:29.516
ASAP?

34:29.518 --> 34:30.893
Uh, we've already
secured a flight

34:30.895 --> 34:32.949
out of Edwards
Air Force Base.

34:36.121 --> 34:38.322
We were kind of hoping
you'd say yes.

34:53.554 --> 34:56.274
I got a security cam
and the button cams

34:56.275 --> 34:57.892
that Sam and Callen
are wearing.

34:57.894 --> 34:59.057
It's a live feed,

34:59.059 --> 35:01.486
but it's delayed,
a little sketchy.

35:01.488 --> 35:04.642
ll, this should suffice,
Mr. Beale.

35:11.119 --> 35:12.281
John Harris.

35:12.283 --> 35:14.386
Sam Hanna, NCIS.

35:15.682 --> 35:17.659
You're in serious danger.
Follow me.

35:20.965 --> 35:22.088
Howdy.

35:22.090 --> 35:23.878
That's me.

35:23.880 --> 35:25.410
I'm John Harris.

35:25.412 --> 35:27.626
You from Atama Security?

35:30.097 --> 35:32.005
He's not buying it.

35:33.983 --> 35:36.230
You're up, tiger.

35:37.611 --> 35:39.604
Oh! Oh, I'm so...
I'm so sorry, sir.

35:39.606 --> 35:42.483
I'm so sorry. Let me just get
your cell phone back. Go, Ken.

35:42.485 --> 35:43.898
Beautiful.

35:49.129 --> 35:51.002
Okay, that was cool.

35:51.005 --> 35:54.172
Let's hope it stays that way.

36:12.865 --> 36:15.419
Let's go.

36:15.421 --> 36:17.552
Out.

36:21.801 --> 36:24.405
Where were you
taking John Harris?

36:24.407 --> 36:26.716
<i>Ana la atakellem</i>
<i>inglieezi.</i>

36:26.718 --> 36:27.872

36:29.176 --> 36:30.298

36:30.300 --> 36:32.349
Save that crap
for the tourists.

36:32.351 --> 36:34.710
Taking me against my will
is a crime.

36:34.712 --> 36:36.256
I've done
nothing wrong,

36:36.258 --> 36:38.128
and you have no authority
in this country.

36:38.130 --> 36:39.576
No, you're absolutely right.

36:39.578 --> 36:41.905
But if you don't cooperate,
you're gonna be absolutely dead.

36:41.907 --> 36:44.640
Where's Adanan Al-Ahmadi?

36:44.642 --> 36:46.789
I know no such man.

36:52.406 --> 36:55.886
You recognize
these men?

36:55.888 --> 36:57.759
Friends of yours?

36:57.761 --> 37:00.604
I don't think he's taking
my threat seriously.

37:00.606 --> 37:03.165
You Americans are very
good at making threats.

37:03.167 --> 37:06.211
But you do not know the
true meaning of jihad.

37:06.213 --> 37:10.562
Your friends, however,
they soon will.

37:10.564 --> 37:12.402
Yeah.

37:12.404 --> 37:15.079
And you'll know the meaning
of <i>La'anatullah.</i>

37:15.081 --> 37:16.418
Looks like you just
bought yourself

37:16.420 --> 37:17.808
a one-way ticket to paradise.

37:20.318 --> 37:21.689
Where he's going isn't paradise.

39:09.393 --> 39:11.853
Omar...

39:13.026 --> 39:14.280
Who are you?

39:14.283 --> 39:15.687
John Harris.

39:15.689 --> 39:20.308
Supposed to meet somebody here
from Atama security.

39:27.042 --> 39:29.016
Am I in the right place?

39:29.018 --> 39:30.858
No.

39:30.860 --> 39:33.235
I'm afraid you are
in the wrong place.

40:07.698 --> 40:08.954
Everybody good?!

40:08.956 --> 40:10.628
I'm good!

40:12.119 --> 40:13.726
Kensi?!

40:15.635 --> 40:16.773
On your knees!

40:16.775 --> 40:18.782
We're good!

40:20.089 --> 40:22.165
What's shaking, boys?

40:23.272 --> 40:26.318
So, John Harris, the man
we intercepted at the airport,

40:26.320 --> 40:28.880
is on a flight home,
and the two men we rescued

40:28.882 --> 40:31.425
have been taken
to Landstuhl Medical Center

40:31.427 --> 40:34.188
in Germany for further
medical evaluation.

40:34.190 --> 40:36.868
And so far, they both
seem to be doing well.

40:36.869 --> 40:38.173
Excellent.

40:38.175 --> 40:41.168
What's going to happen
with Adanan Al-Ahmadi?

40:41.170 --> 40:42.541
Out of our hands now.

40:42.543 --> 40:45.951
The D.O.D. will hammer out
some sort of an agreement

40:45.953 --> 40:48.878
with the United Arab Emirates
to deal with him.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.997
And our team should be
safe and sound

40:50.999 --> 40:52.403
on their return flight back.

40:52.405 --> 40:54.619
Well done.

40:55.497 --> 40:56.871
Go home.

40:56.873 --> 40:59.020
Are you sure you don't
want us to wait?

40:59.022 --> 41:02.198
When she says go home,
we go home, Ununoctium.

41:05.227 --> 41:06.632
This-- oh, this is my favorite.

41:06.634 --> 41:07.690
Look at that.

41:07.692 --> 41:09.395
This is me riding
through the sand dunes.

41:09.397 --> 41:10.718
You can't tell that's me,
but I'm the driver.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.535
Look how much air
I'm getting in this photo.

41:13.537 --> 41:15.546
Oh, my gosh, this is a
16-hour flight, Deeks.

41:15.548 --> 41:16.786
Oh, don't worry,
we'll get through

41:16.788 --> 41:18.233
all of them
before we land.

41:20.103 --> 41:21.775
And this--
that, you know that guy.

41:22.597 --> 41:24.447
Hold up.

41:24.449 --> 41:25.477
Huh?

41:25.479 --> 41:27.408
That you on a
camel, Deeks?

41:27.410 --> 41:28.985
Yeah.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.306
Let me see that.

41:30.308 --> 41:32.478
That's funny.

41:32.480 --> 41:33.735
What else you got?

41:33.736 --> 41:34.844
I got this.

41:34.846 --> 41:37.001
Ha!

41:37.003 --> 41:38.627
Look like Lawrence
of Arabia.

41:38.629 --> 41:39.851
Right?!

41:39.853 --> 41:41.560
That's what I said!

41:41.562 --> 41:42.700
Be my guest.

41:42.702 --> 41:44.377
Yeah?

41:44.379 --> 41:45.667
That's cool.

41:46.927 --> 41:48.852
All right, check this out.
You're gonna love this.

41:51.502 --> 41:53.548
Hetty made arrangements
for someone to debrief

41:53.550 --> 41:55.976
Mr. and Mrs. Adams
about their son's death.

41:55.978 --> 41:58.040
It won't make it any easier,
but hopefully they'll find

41:58.042 --> 41:59.744
some closure knowing
that he wasn't a traitor.

41:59.746 --> 42:02.979
If anything, his
death saved others,

42:02.981 --> 42:05.595
and it helped us
catch Al-Ahmadi.

42:05.597 --> 42:07.014
That's awesome!

42:13.797 --> 42:16.196
Love it when our boys
get along.

42:16.198 --> 42:17.781
Love it when someone else 
has to look at Deeks's vacation photos.
