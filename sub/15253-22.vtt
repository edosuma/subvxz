00:00.090 --> 00:00.974
<i>Hi I'm Chuck.</i>

00:01.026 --> 00:02.610
<i>Here are a few things that</i>
<i>you might need to know.</i>

00:02.626 --> 00:04.460
El, I need to talk to you
about Dad's computer.

00:04.550 --> 00:07.218
Yeah, I thought
that I uncovered some

00:07.286 --> 00:08.652
<i>secret files.</i>
<i>Turned out just to be</i>

00:08.720 --> 00:10.754
<i>cheats on some video game</i>
<i>that he was developing.</i>

00:10.822 --> 00:12.190
My sister just
lied to me.

00:12.257 --> 00:13.924
She's never lied to me.

00:13.993 --> 00:15.893
<i>There was only one man my</i>
<i>father was ever afraid of.</i>

00:15.961 --> 00:17.561
He went by the name Agent X.

00:17.629 --> 00:19.830
I'm going to track him down
and kill him.

00:19.898 --> 00:22.232
Then no one can touch me, ever.

00:45.923 --> 00:47.323
Freeze!

00:47.391 --> 00:51.794
Take it easy, Tiger,
I'm-I'm here to help.

00:51.862 --> 00:54.696
DS&T picked up some chatter
of a possible break-in attempt.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.601
Not likely.

00:59.669 --> 01:01.403
It's always a ghost
town down here.

01:02.338 --> 01:03.605
Oh, damn it.

01:03.673 --> 01:05.941
I'm sorry, I haven't had
my morning coffee yet.

01:08.678 --> 01:12.513
Let me, um... help.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.319
Who says
chivalry is dead?

01:23.825 --> 01:25.826
Good work.

01:25.894 --> 01:27.794
I knew there was
a reason I brought you,

01:27.862 --> 01:29.829
outside of the
obvious, of course.

01:39.173 --> 01:40.373
Mm...

01:40.441 --> 01:43.108
That's the computer with
all the Agent X files?

01:43.176 --> 01:45.377
No, it's a tracker.

01:45.445 --> 01:47.880
Somebody must be
using the computer.

01:47.948 --> 01:51.183
But it looks as if
the CIA is keeping tabs.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.451
Locate this signal,

01:52.518 --> 01:55.120
and we'll have exactly
what Miss Volkoff wants.

01:55.188 --> 01:57.456
This was too easy.

01:57.523 --> 01:59.724
Have to imagine the CIA
is being way more careful

01:59.792 --> 02:01.859
with the actual computer.

02:02.962 --> 02:04.729
Oh, shoot.

02:04.797 --> 02:06.263
Ellie, come on.

02:08.366 --> 02:09.701
Hey, babe, doing a little
last-minute prep

02:09.768 --> 02:11.202
for Chuck's bachelor party.

02:11.269 --> 02:12.870
Can you give me
a little sunscreen pre-coat?

02:12.938 --> 02:13.905
Sure...

02:13.973 --> 02:15.806
Uh, make sure you
lube up the lats.

02:15.873 --> 02:17.507
Gonna be sunny in Vegas.

02:19.410 --> 02:20.877
What's with the old house?

02:20.945 --> 02:23.480
That? I figured out
a cyclomatic complexity

02:23.547 --> 02:25.181
that ran through
all the conditionals

02:25.249 --> 02:26.817
in my dad's research--
that's the end of the loop.

02:26.884 --> 02:28.719
Awesome.
All paths

02:28.786 --> 02:30.920
seem to end
at that photo.

02:30.988 --> 02:32.722
I don't understand--
why would my dad want me

02:32.789 --> 02:34.223
to have this picture
of an old house?

02:34.290 --> 02:35.357
What are you doing, El?

02:35.425 --> 02:36.592
Aren't you
supposed to be getting ready

02:36.660 --> 02:37.593
for Sarah's
bachelorette party?

02:37.661 --> 02:38.861
Honey, don't worry.

02:38.929 --> 02:40.329
Clara's already at your
parents' house,

02:40.396 --> 02:42.564
I am all packed for our
girls' day trip; I promise

02:42.633 --> 02:44.366
I will turn it off as soon
as the festivities begin.

02:44.434 --> 02:45.701
Okay?
Fair enough.

02:45.769 --> 02:47.201
Gonna finish packing
for the dude trip.

02:47.269 --> 02:50.105
Vegas, baby. Vegas...!

02:50.172 --> 02:54.075
♪ ♪

02:58.447 --> 02:59.914
Yo.

03:01.283 --> 03:03.184
May I ask the best
man what casino

03:03.252 --> 03:04.852
we're going to be
hitting first?

03:04.919 --> 03:08.156
I got a fat stack
burning a hole in my crotch.

03:09.324 --> 03:10.458
I-I don't think
that's, uh...

03:10.526 --> 03:11.592
Oh, no;
it's burning.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.827
Uh, no-no idea,
actually.

03:13.895 --> 03:15.129
I put Awesome in charge
of everything.

03:15.197 --> 03:17.398
Apparently, he's
the Vegas expert.

03:17.466 --> 03:18.633
Nice.
Yeah.

03:18.700 --> 03:19.633
What about you, Casey?

03:19.700 --> 03:20.634
Any casino
preferences?

03:20.701 --> 03:21.868
No. Forget the casinos.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.603
Best thing about Vegas
are the gun ranges.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.772
Brought some of my
fancytargets.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.507
Well, I got
some bad news.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.642
See you guys
on Monday.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.643
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.644
Hang on, Big Michael.

03:30.711 --> 03:31.811
You're not coming?

03:31.879 --> 03:34.281
Bologna Grimes says
I couldn't go.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.148
She knows I tapped Vegas dry

03:36.216 --> 03:38.217
back when I was with
Earth, Wind, Fire, and Rain.

03:38.285 --> 03:39.985
You want me to call this
Baloney lady,

03:40.053 --> 03:41.953
give her the what for?
Nah.

03:42.021 --> 03:43.289
Once Bologna has made
a decision,

03:43.356 --> 03:44.590
there's no going back on it.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.226
You guys enjoy.

03:51.197 --> 03:52.630
No!

03:52.698 --> 03:54.165
No-no-no-no,
no-no-no-no.

03:54.233 --> 03:55.466
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

03:55.534 --> 03:57.635
Y-You are my
future stepfather.

03:57.703 --> 03:59.070
This will not stand.

03:59.137 --> 04:01.506
Now, come on... We're men!

04:01.574 --> 04:02.840
Men who take what's theirs!

04:02.908 --> 04:06.010
You have to march into
that house,

04:06.078 --> 04:07.144
slam your fist on the counter,

04:07.212 --> 04:09.680
and then you look
at my mother in the eye,

04:09.747 --> 04:12.082
and you say, "Bologna,
I am so sorry, woman..."

04:13.351 --> 04:14.651
"...but I have to work at
the Buy More all weekend."

04:14.719 --> 04:16.620
You see, this way,
when she asks <i>me,</i>

04:16.688 --> 04:17.987
I'll say, "Yeah, we got
all this new inventory.

04:18.055 --> 04:19.856
We have to work around
the clock." Boom!
Boom.

04:19.923 --> 04:21.291
Heh.

04:22.993 --> 04:24.560
That's the greatest thing...

04:24.628 --> 04:27.096
a white person's
ever done for me.

04:29.733 --> 04:31.367
Let's go to Vegas!

04:31.435 --> 04:33.035
Vegas, Vegas.

04:33.103 --> 04:35.104
What does a bachelor
wear in Vegas?

04:35.171 --> 04:37.206
I can't believe you've
never been to Vegas.

04:37.274 --> 04:40.141
And, by the way, a bachelor
does not wear that.

04:40.209 --> 04:43.077
What? You're not digging
the whole business up-top,

04:43.145 --> 04:44.613
party below-the-waist
thing? I figured

04:44.680 --> 04:47.148
it covered all the Vegas
activities with one fell swoop.

04:47.216 --> 04:49.183
Speaking of "looks,"
you're sure doing

04:49.252 --> 04:51.253
an awful lot of
maintenance over there.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.654
Oh, I'm just
reminding you

04:52.722 --> 04:54.356
of what you'll be
missing out on in Vegas.

04:54.423 --> 04:56.823
Oh, trust me, I'll remember.

04:58.360 --> 05:00.179
Where's Ellie taking
you guys anyway?

05:00.204 --> 05:01.404
I'm not sure.

05:01.596 --> 05:03.631
Every time I do recon,
she's on your dad's computer.

05:03.698 --> 05:05.733
She spends a lot of time
on that thing.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.001
Yeah, well, Ellie's always
been into puzzles;

05:08.069 --> 05:11.071
you know, logic puzzles,
Sudoku, crosswords-- I mean,

05:11.139 --> 05:13.640
one of my earliest memories of
my sister was when she solved

05:13.707 --> 05:16.542
the 12-sided Rubik's Cube before
I even got mine out of the box.

05:16.610 --> 05:19.312
Have you spoken to Devon yet?

05:19.380 --> 05:20.813
Told him that
you know that

05:20.881 --> 05:23.215
Ellie is still using the computer?
No.

05:23.284 --> 05:25.518
Not yet.

05:25.586 --> 05:28.487
I'm planning on having
a good man-to-man talk

05:28.554 --> 05:30.088
as soon as we get to Vegas.

05:30.156 --> 05:31.556
I mean, it's
the perfect place to have

05:31.624 --> 05:33.992
a sincere, honest,
heartfelt conversation.

05:34.059 --> 05:37.396
You really have never been
to Vegas, have you?

05:37.463 --> 05:39.665
Awesome...!

05:39.732 --> 05:41.667
Let's go, let's
go, let's go!

05:41.734 --> 05:43.801
Uh... just a minute, Chuck!

05:43.868 --> 05:45.002
Coming!

05:46.271 --> 05:47.405
Hi.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.072
Hi.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.074
What's up?
I was just, uh,

05:51.142 --> 05:52.710
I was reading a book.

05:52.778 --> 05:54.978
You don't have to
lie to me, Ellie.

05:56.615 --> 05:58.616
I know you're planning Sarah's

05:58.684 --> 06:00.450
bachelorette party-- come on,
we've all got some secrets.

06:00.518 --> 06:01.718
Don't we Awesome?

06:01.786 --> 06:02.985
You don't know the
half of it, bro.

06:03.053 --> 06:04.754
Let me tell
you something.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.088
This weekend...

06:06.156 --> 06:08.425
I'm going to make
a man out of you.

06:08.492 --> 06:11.461
Goody!
Can't wait for that.

06:11.529 --> 06:14.864
Okay, well, you guys
have fun. Be safe,

06:14.932 --> 06:16.432
and I'm just...
I'm going to do stuff.

06:16.499 --> 06:18.900
Okay.
Okay.

06:18.968 --> 06:22.003

07:16.797 --> 07:18.231
<i>All right, boys.</i>

07:18.299 --> 07:19.532
I want you to get ready.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.933
Even if you've been
to the City of Sin before,

07:21.001 --> 07:22.234
you've never been with me.

07:22.302 --> 07:24.669
Awesome, thank you so much
for planning this trip.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.505
Dude, you kidding?
I live for this.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.974
Okay, we need to think
of this weekend like a war.

07:29.042 --> 07:30.876
Now you're talking
my language.

07:30.944 --> 07:33.545
When we get there, we
immediately take over The Strip.

07:33.613 --> 07:36.514
High rollin'
on The Strip!

07:36.581 --> 07:38.416
What the... Ow! Ow!

07:38.483 --> 07:40.418
What are you doing?!
I'm making it rain--

07:40.485 --> 07:43.221
Canadian style-- which is,
technically, making it snow.

07:44.489 --> 07:46.157
Dolla dolla coins, y'all!

07:46.225 --> 07:48.026
Boom!
Save the Socialist

07:48.093 --> 07:49.660
funny money.
And save your energy.

07:49.728 --> 07:51.262
Vegas is the land of excess.

07:51.330 --> 07:52.695
For those of you who like

07:52.763 --> 07:54.764
to chase tail,
there is plenty of that, too.

07:54.832 --> 07:56.699
Rest up, boys...

07:56.767 --> 07:59.702
'cause we might not sleep
again for a long time.

08:02.673 --> 08:05.208
<i>bachelorette weekend.l</i>

08:05.276 --> 08:07.944
Cheers.

08:08.011 --> 08:10.279
So, are you going to let me
in on the big secret?

08:10.347 --> 08:11.914
What have you got
planned for tomorrow?

08:11.982 --> 08:14.550
Okay, we are going
to a spa

08:14.617 --> 08:17.053
in Santa Barbara, and we're
not just doing massages

08:17.120 --> 08:18.620
we're doing body scrubs, too.

08:18.688 --> 08:20.889
Wow, uh...

08:20.958 --> 08:23.725
That sounds very... relaxing.

08:23.793 --> 08:26.328
Get ready for some
hardcore aromatherapy.

08:33.534 --> 08:35.903
All right, boys!

08:35.972 --> 08:37.371
Let's tear this town a new one!

08:37.440 --> 08:39.073
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!

08:39.140 --> 08:40.274
Whoo!

08:40.342 --> 08:42.076
Whoo! Whoo!

08:45.813 --> 08:48.949
Welcome to Las Vecas, boys!

08:51.019 --> 08:53.320
Captain, what's, uh,
what's-what's going on?

08:53.388 --> 08:54.321
This is not Las Vegas.

08:54.389 --> 08:56.789
Las Vecas, buddy.
Look!

09:00.594 --> 09:04.964
So this whole time you've been
saying "Las Ve-cas"?

09:05.032 --> 09:07.066
Of course! What else
would I be saying?

09:07.134 --> 09:08.667
Las Vegas.
Hold on a second,

09:08.735 --> 09:10.569
I heard you say we're going
to the City of Sin.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.504
This is the City
of Cinn... amon Falls.

09:12.571 --> 09:13.938
After the
famous waterfall.

09:14.007 --> 09:15.474
The locals call it
the "City of Cinn. "

09:15.541 --> 09:16.941
What about taking
over The Strip?

09:17.010 --> 09:18.843
Yeah, the old mining strip.
It's next to the campsite.

09:18.911 --> 09:20.178
I thought we were
going to chase tail.

09:20.246 --> 09:22.014
There's a huge yellow-bellied
marmot population.

09:22.081 --> 09:23.482
They love
being chased.

09:23.549 --> 09:25.117
Long as I can set up
a gun range.

09:25.184 --> 09:27.852
Yeah, nature's gun range--
the great outdoors.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.687
Hey. You okay, buddy?

09:30.755 --> 09:31.788
I know that you
were looking forward

09:31.856 --> 09:32.990
to partying in Vegas
most of all.

09:33.058 --> 09:35.526
What? I knew we were
going to Vecas!

09:35.593 --> 09:37.194
Oh.
This place
is amazing!

09:37.262 --> 09:39.530
They grow some magic fungus

09:39.597 --> 09:41.999

maybe chase a little tail.

That's the spirit,
big guy!

Yeah! Let's get unpacked.

<i>Well, I better go unpack</i>

09:47.604 --> 09:49.472
and rest up
for the big day.

09:49.540 --> 09:52.008
Rest up? This is your
bachelorette party.

09:52.076 --> 09:54.277
We have to get you tired
before you can rest.

09:54.345 --> 09:56.679
Tired?
Come on...

09:59.783 --> 10:01.483
Yeah!

Come on, you didn't
think I was

10:03.219 --> 10:04.953
just going to take you
to some lame spa, right?

10:05.021 --> 10:08.223
I tried to call the girls from
the CAT squad, but they

10:08.291 --> 10:09.525
were away in
Libya somewhere,

10:09.592 --> 10:11.093
so I invited a few of
the Wienerlicious girls

10:11.161 --> 10:12.461
and some friends
from the hospital.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.363
Thank you. This is
a very nice surprise.

10:14.431 --> 10:17.298
I know it's not going to be
like as crazy as Vegas, but, uh,

10:17.366 --> 10:18.967
we'll have a few drinks,
see where the night takes us.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.170
Okay.
Okay.

10:29.311 --> 10:31.145
All right, boys.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.581
Get ready for the
bachelor party hike.

10:33.648 --> 10:34.748
I figure we can forage

10:34.816 --> 10:36.717
for our supper out there.

10:36.785 --> 10:39.352
I do not forage.

10:39.420 --> 10:40.721
Okay, look, guys, I know

10:40.789 --> 10:42.422
this isn't exactly Las Vegas,

10:42.490 --> 10:43.757
but Awesome worked really hard

10:43.825 --> 10:45.158
putting this all together,
you know?

10:45.226 --> 10:47.194
Got to admire the man for
sticking to his strategy.

10:47.261 --> 10:48.728
Sure, and you know what? A hike

10:48.796 --> 10:50.029
actually sounds
pretty invigorating right now.

10:50.097 --> 10:52.765
I've never hiked in a tie.
I know, right? Yeah.

10:52.833 --> 10:53.866
Get the blood pumping.

10:53.934 --> 10:55.902
I mean, it could be
just as fun as Vegas.

10:55.970 --> 10:57.570
'Cause this weekend is-is...

10:57.638 --> 10:59.839
it's about bonding after all,
isn't it?

10:59.907 --> 11:02.541
No. No, it isn't.

11:02.610 --> 11:04.243
BIG MIKE: Not at all.
It's about

11:04.311 --> 11:06.578
steaks and gambling and-and
getting into in some weird stuff

11:06.646 --> 11:08.914
that just might haunt you
the rest of your life.

11:08.982 --> 11:11.216
Amen. Michael,
may I have a word with you

11:11.283 --> 11:12.918

Listen.

You were the best,
wiener girl.

11:26.064 --> 11:27.498
Hey, Chuck, listen,

11:27.565 --> 11:29.600
the secure CIA location
has been compromised,

11:29.668 --> 11:32.169
and we need to bring in
the Orion computer immediately.

11:32.237 --> 11:33.671
Can you please call me back

11:33.739 --> 11:36.973
and tell me where your sister
keeps it, okay? Call me.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.175
Okay, game time!

a toilet paper dress!

Oh, listen, Ellie,
can we please talk? I want...

Ellie, wait.
We need to talk.

Okay, Ellie, no, this...

Listen, this can't wait.
Okay, my...

My employer knows about... about
your father's computer, and...

to a secure location right now!

up the road.

Okay, there's nothing
to be alarmed about.

12:12.508 --> 12:14.242
It's just,
the CIA had a breach

12:14.310 --> 12:16.411
of security, and your dad's
computer could be involved.

12:16.479 --> 12:17.646
Oh, I should have known

12:17.713 --> 12:19.281
something like this
would happen.

I'm so sorry, Sarah. I...

12:20.716 --> 12:23.451
I was accessing a lot of
weird stuff on that computer.

an Agent X

it by mistake.

There is nothing to worry about.

He put her old man
behind bars,

party started!

16:22.137 --> 16:24.204
My sentiments exactly.

the encryption.

16:30.177 --> 16:32.012
I'll upload the files
to Miss Volkoff.

16:32.079 --> 16:34.915
Yeah, but first, find out
how much he knows.

16:34.982 --> 16:38.018
If he doesn't talk,
see that he never talks again.

16:42.022 --> 16:43.689
Welcome back.

16:43.757 --> 16:45.257
You know why
I'm here, don't you?

16:45.325 --> 16:48.360
Is it because
I've been a bad boy?

16:50.764 --> 16:52.398
What's in the shooter?

16:52.466 --> 16:55.233
Sodium pentathol--
truth serum.

16:55.301 --> 16:56.635
Freaky.

16:56.702 --> 16:59.438
I don't think that'll
mix with what I'm on.

Guys-- Jeff--
they're torturing him.

wander in at any second.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Casey, what's the plan?

17:21.291 --> 17:23.126
Who was that?
Mercenaries.

17:23.194 --> 17:25.796
Ex-Green Berets,
judging by their tactics.

17:25.864 --> 17:27.329
I count three, including
the leader in camp.

17:27.396 --> 17:28.832
Guys, did you see
that clean break?

17:28.899 --> 17:30.032
Maybe I can save him.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.835
No, he's dead,
and so are we,

17:31.902 --> 17:33.069
unless you three
tighten up.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.471
What's this?

17:34.538 --> 17:36.739
You and Morgan are gonna find
some good strong sticks

17:36.807 --> 17:37.907
and start sharpening.

17:37.975 --> 17:39.075
Yes, sir.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.276
Perfect. Sharpening what?

17:41.411 --> 17:42.945
Toothpicks.
Ah.

17:43.012 --> 17:44.813
Spears, you idiot.

17:44.881 --> 17:46.281
I'll draw the rest
of the team out into the woods.

17:46.349 --> 17:49.518
I'm sorry. You want us to fight
former Green Berets with spears?

17:49.586 --> 17:52.654
Not you. You're gonna go down
to the camp and spring Jeff.

Happy hunting, boys.

17:55.825 --> 17:57.493
Happy hunting?

The first one...
the first one's the hardest.

Wow. Really?

19:01.987 --> 19:03.687

give me a gun on missions.

Are you kidding me?

19:07.458 --> 19:08.559
I'm a doctor.

19:08.626 --> 19:10.027
I took an oath to
preserve lives.

19:10.094 --> 19:11.261
What about your own life?

19:11.328 --> 19:12.996
Dude, you heard Casey.
It's them, or it's us.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.032
What if we met these
guys at a bar?

19:15.099 --> 19:17.034
You know, we could be frat
brothers, for all I know.

19:17.101 --> 19:18.901
Frat brothers-- these
are mercenaries, dude.

19:18.969 --> 19:21.003
Drinks? Beers?

19:22.806 --> 19:23.906
You hear something?

19:23.974 --> 19:25.675
No. You're having
first "mish" jitters.

19:25.742 --> 19:27.342
It's not my first "mish."
I think it's your first "mish."

19:27.410 --> 19:31.180
How are those spears coming?

19:31.247 --> 19:33.348
You are lucky we didn't
kill you with these spears!

19:33.416 --> 19:35.416
They are really sharp.
I feel so bad

19:35.484 --> 19:37.518
for those mercenaries
right about now-- zah!

19:37.587 --> 19:38.887
You ought to. They're dead.

19:38.955 --> 19:41.522
Dead?
Well, what are these for?

19:41.591 --> 19:43.058
They kept you out of my way.

19:55.269 --> 19:57.471
Men, what's your status?

19:57.538 --> 19:59.707
Oh, poor baby.

19:59.774 --> 20:01.508
you're fresh out of friends.
Looks like

20:01.576 --> 20:04.578
Well, in that case, I'm just
gonna have to come out there

20:04.646 --> 20:06.646
and kill you myself.

20:06.714 --> 20:08.881
The captive's unconscious.
Kill him.

20:35.642 --> 20:37.342
I see you've had knife training.

20:37.409 --> 20:38.943
Let me give you
one final lesson.

20:50.255 --> 20:51.488
It's over.

20:58.229 --> 20:59.596
It's over.

21:09.874 --> 21:13.142
Sorry to interrupt
your little lap dance.

21:18.282 --> 21:22.718
If anyone's still alive,
meet me at the extraction point.

21:22.786 --> 21:24.187
What the hell's going on?

21:24.254 --> 21:26.055
Jeff's having a bad trip. We've
got to get out of Vecas now.

21:26.122 --> 21:28.723
Good thing you boys came
to your senses.

21:28.791 --> 21:29.991
Best bachelor party ever.

21:30.059 --> 21:31.793
Vecas, baby! Yeah.

21:41.672 --> 21:43.206
Hey, where have you been?

21:43.206 --> 21:44.640
Beckman sent a
team to Vegas.

21:44.708 --> 21:46.108
They've been looking for you.

21:46.175 --> 21:48.442
Yeah, wrong Vegas.

21:48.511 --> 21:49.978
So where is Orion's laptop?

21:50.045 --> 21:51.345
Beckman thought that--

21:51.413 --> 21:52.814
She was right-- Vivian Volkoff
sent a team for it.

21:52.882 --> 21:54.015
They tried to kill us.

21:54.082 --> 21:55.850
I've got to tell Ellie
what she got herself into.

21:55.918 --> 21:56.985
If I didn't grab
the wrong bag,

21:57.052 --> 21:58.285
you girls would
have been ambushed.

21:58.353 --> 22:00.354
I agree-- Ellie
deserves to know.

22:00.422 --> 22:01.856
I'll tell her.

22:01.924 --> 22:03.790
I feel responsible that the
CIA used her to find Agent X.

22:03.858 --> 22:04.791
No, I'll tell her.

22:08.696 --> 22:12.132
But then you'll have to tell
her the truth about you.

22:13.234 --> 22:15.168
I know.

22:25.245 --> 22:27.413
What are you doing home?

22:27.480 --> 22:30.917
Uh, I had to cut the
bachelor party short.

22:30.984 --> 22:32.919
There-There's something
that's been on my mind.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.054
What is it?

22:37.657 --> 22:41.125
We've always been able to tell
each other anything, right?

22:42.227 --> 22:44.462
Lately I felt like...

22:44.530 --> 22:46.731
Like there's something
in the way.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.034
Yes, exactly, our family

22:49.101 --> 22:50.501
is so full
of secrets.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.869
Too many secrets.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.070
I mean,
our parents alone...

22:53.137 --> 22:54.504
Yeah, and, and,
d d I don't think

22:54.573 --> 22:56.574
there should be any secrets
between the two of us.

22:56.641 --> 22:57.825
I've been working
on something secret.

22:57.826 --> 22:58.576
I didn't want to tell you

22:58.577 --> 22:59.743
because I didn't want you
to worry and...

22:59.811 --> 23:00.978
I know about Dad's laptop

23:01.046 --> 23:03.981
and his research--
Mom told me.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.983
So why are we here?

23:09.620 --> 23:11.554
You're still a spy.

23:11.622 --> 23:12.855
Wait, w-w-wait,
wait, wait a second,

23:12.923 --> 23:14.390
I had a whole speech and
you just figured that out.

23:14.458 --> 23:16.025
You can't figure that
out by yourself.

23:16.093 --> 23:18.360
I think I just did.

23:18.428 --> 23:21.230
You just Rubik's
Cubed me, sis.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.634
Of course you still work
for the CIA.

23:25.702 --> 23:27.368
Sarah's a spy,
you're clearly built

23:27.436 --> 23:29.705
for better things
than the Buy More.

23:32.141 --> 23:34.076
You're not mad?

23:34.143 --> 23:35.844
I'm not mad that you did it.

23:35.912 --> 23:37.378
I'm mad
that you didn't tell me.

23:37.446 --> 23:38.880
I mean, I get it--
it's the same reason

23:38.948 --> 23:40.881
that I kept Dad's computer
a secret from you.

23:43.218 --> 23:45.219
Us Bartowskis--
when we're good at something,

23:45.286 --> 23:48.188
we just jump right in,
don't we?

23:48.256 --> 23:49.890
No more secrets, though.

23:51.292 --> 23:53.227
One more little secret.

24:03.671 --> 24:06.106
Wow, look at this place.

24:08.609 --> 24:12.577
What are you guys guarding
down here that's so important?

24:12.646 --> 24:16.481
Uh, well... me.

24:16.549 --> 24:18.483
El, you know

24:18.551 --> 24:20.719
that Intersect project
that Dad was working on?

24:20.787 --> 24:23.922
Yeah, I've been trying
to figure it out for weeks.

24:23.990 --> 24:26.625
It's in my head.

24:27.726 --> 24:29.661
What?

24:29.728 --> 24:30.828
No...

24:30.896 --> 24:33.898
Uh, Morgan,
Katana sword, please.

24:33.966 --> 24:36.834
Oh, yes, yes,
Katana, all right.

24:36.902 --> 24:39.070
Uh, full speed
or half speed?

24:39.138 --> 24:40.138
Full speed, thank you.

24:40.205 --> 24:42.073
Okay, okay.

24:43.008 --> 24:44.440
Banzai...!

25:19.875 --> 25:21.242
Sleeveless.

25:21.310 --> 25:23.644
It's a bit '80s, but
I like this look.

25:25.181 --> 25:27.115
Pretty cool, right?

25:29.551 --> 25:30.685
Our dad was amazing.

25:30.753 --> 25:33.453
He did it.

25:33.521 --> 25:35.388
He actually figured out a way

25:35.456 --> 25:38.425
to program the
human brain using...

25:40.228 --> 25:41.729
What happened?

25:41.796 --> 25:44.064
I was going to use this
to find Agent X.

25:44.132 --> 25:45.599
Ellie, you found him.

25:45.666 --> 25:47.400
You're looking at the first
human Intersect-- it's me.

25:47.468 --> 25:51.070
No, not unless he gave it
to you before you were born.

25:51.138 --> 25:53.139
November 21, 1980.

25:54.541 --> 25:56.675
What, there was an Intersect
before Chuck?

25:56.744 --> 25:58.444
From what I can piece
together from his files,

25:58.511 --> 26:00.113
Dad used this program
to input

26:00.180 --> 26:02.115
a new identity
into an operative.

26:02.182 --> 26:04.216
So Agent X
could go undercover.

26:04.283 --> 26:05.851
But once he went undercover,
something went wrong.

26:05.918 --> 26:07.619
The program took over.

26:07.686 --> 26:09.955
He became
his cover identity.

26:10.022 --> 26:11.689
Dad must have felt
responsible for it

26:11.758 --> 26:13.959
and that's why he spent
his whole life looking for him.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.968
Not that that's going
to happen now.

26:24.035 --> 26:26.470
Ellie,

26:26.537 --> 26:28.005
I haven't spent
ten years

26:28.073 --> 26:29.740
in the Nerd Herd for nothing.

26:29.808 --> 26:31.375
Morgan, get my tools.

26:31.442 --> 26:33.510
Yes, sir,
of course.

26:33.578 --> 26:35.079
What tools?

26:35.147 --> 26:36.412
For fixing computers.

26:36.480 --> 26:39.048
Tools for fixing computers,
coming up.

26:42.987 --> 26:46.089
Well, I might as well get
started on this inventory.

26:46.157 --> 26:48.524
Somehow my cover story
became the truth.

26:52.595 --> 26:55.130
Hold on a second.

26:55.198 --> 26:56.564
Let me ask you two a question.

26:57.767 --> 26:59.268
Who am I?

26:59.335 --> 27:00.435
You're Big Mike.

27:00.503 --> 27:01.436
No,

27:01.504 --> 27:03.438
I'm Rain...

27:03.506 --> 27:06.741
of Earth, Wind, Fire, and Rain.

27:06.810 --> 27:08.742
And Rain
does not waste

27:08.811 --> 27:10.912
a free party pass.

27:10.979 --> 27:12.246
Neither does Thunder.

27:13.615 --> 27:15.183
Is that name taken?

27:15.250 --> 27:17.251
Okay, wait, wait--

27:17.319 --> 27:19.787
are we going to go
to the real Vegas?
No.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.522
Well, then...
Me and the boys had

27:21.589 --> 27:24.124
a standing engagement in a city

27:24.192 --> 27:26.193
that makes Vegas look
like the Vatican.

27:27.061 --> 27:28.895
What is this mythical place?

27:30.031 --> 27:31.898
Go get my Corolla.

27:31.966 --> 27:35.702
We're going to
The Big Dirty-- Reno.

28:03.295 --> 28:05.163
Got it.

28:05.231 --> 28:07.131
Okay, here, uh,
here are the files.

28:07.199 --> 28:08.333
Dad must have collected

28:08.400 --> 28:10.134
everything there
was on Agent X,

28:10.202 --> 28:12.269
for what
it's worth.

28:12.337 --> 28:14.571
His whole file's been redacted.

28:14.638 --> 28:16.573
Except for a name-Hartley.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.075
He did leave something else.

28:18.142 --> 28:21.478
I have no idea what it means
or if it's some sort of clue.

28:30.921 --> 28:32.021
I know where that is.

28:32.089 --> 28:33.222
What, how?

28:36.026 --> 28:38.294
The Intersect--
that's incredible.

28:38.362 --> 28:39.962
Yeah.

28:42.966 --> 28:44.900
Ellie, look
at that date.

28:46.869 --> 28:48.870
It's a week before
Agent X went missing.

28:48.938 --> 28:50.872
Do you think maybe he took
the photo as a keepsake

28:50.940 --> 28:51.873
before his
final mission?

28:51.941 --> 28:52.874
This place must be
special for him.

28:52.942 --> 28:54.475
Maybe it's his home.

28:54.543 --> 28:56.344
Or some kind of safe house.

28:56.412 --> 28:58.179
You think Agent X

28:58.247 --> 28:59.881
has been hiding out there
for 30 years?

28:59.948 --> 29:01.348
Hmm.

29:04.352 --> 29:06.220
What's going on?

29:06.288 --> 29:08.154
Uh, well, Ellie,

29:08.222 --> 29:10.557
we're not the only ones
trying to find Agent X.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.459
The people who put that
hole in Dad's laptop--

29:12.527 --> 29:13.460
they're after him, too.

29:13.528 --> 29:15.328
Well, I'm coming with you.

29:15.396 --> 29:16.329
What, are you crazy?

29:16.397 --> 29:18.231
No, two words:
Baby Clara.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.233
What about you?

29:20.301 --> 29:21.234
Don't worry about it.

29:21.302 --> 29:22.869
It's what I do.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.798
Place hasn't
change in 30 years.

29:32.865 --> 29:34.700
Looks like somebody's
still living there.

29:34.767 --> 29:36.635
If this Agent X guy
has been hiding from the CIA

29:36.703 --> 29:38.169
all these years,
he might not take too well

29:38.237 --> 29:40.271
to being found.

29:46.712 --> 29:48.646
WOMAN
Oh, hello.

29:48.714 --> 29:50.514
May I help you?

29:51.583 --> 29:53.217
Uh, so sorry

29:53.284 --> 29:55.119
to disturb you,
ma'am, but our car

29:55.186 --> 29:57.654
has just broken down, and I was
looking in the, in the boot--

29:57.722 --> 29:59.089
the bonnet.

29:59.156 --> 30:01.224
Uh, long story short
we're stranded.

30:01.291 --> 30:02.792
Could we please use your phone?

30:02.860 --> 30:04.761
Oh, of course, come in.

30:04.829 --> 30:07.063
I'll make some tea while
you wait for the lorry.

30:07.131 --> 30:08.064
Thank you.

30:08.132 --> 30:09.833
That way.

30:09.900 --> 30:10.834
Cheers, lovely.

30:16.372 --> 30:19.074
What's taking her so long?

30:19.142 --> 30:20.509
Will you
relax, Casey?

30:20.576 --> 30:22.277
You don't think she's
Agent X, do you?

30:22.345 --> 30:24.279
I don't know who
the hell she is.

30:24.347 --> 30:26.048
That old bird could
be poisoning our tea

30:26.116 --> 30:28.017
as we speak.
Here we are.

30:28.084 --> 30:30.018
Nice cup of tea.

30:31.553 --> 30:34.188
Now, get it while it's hot.

30:35.257 --> 30:36.691
And this one is for you.

30:36.759 --> 30:38.893
Thank you.

30:54.542 --> 30:56.476
Delicious, thank you.

30:58.479 --> 31:00.881
So where are
you all from?

31:00.948 --> 31:03.382
Um, not far
from here, actually.

31:03.449 --> 31:05.718
I was just showing my fiancé
a bit of the countryside

31:05.786 --> 31:06.886
before the wedding.

31:06.953 --> 31:08.087
He's American,
of course.

31:08.155 --> 31:09.088
Hmm.

31:09.156 --> 31:10.289
And this handsome

31:10.356 --> 31:11.623
young man?

31:11.692 --> 31:13.025
He is-is

31:13.093 --> 31:15.427
a hitchhiker we picked up
on the edge of town.

31:15.495 --> 31:16.461
Yeah, he had
such a nice face,

31:16.529 --> 31:18.863
we figured,
what the hell?

31:18.931 --> 31:20.732
Uh, I was just telling my fiancé

31:20.800 --> 31:22.767
that my father had a friend
who lived here, actually.

31:22.835 --> 31:24.202
In this house?

31:24.269 --> 31:25.770
Oh, how
interesting.

31:25.838 --> 31:27.271
Yes, I believe
his name was Hartley.

31:27.339 --> 31:28.873
Any relation
to you?

31:28.941 --> 31:31.542
Oh, no, I'm just
an old spinster.

31:34.012 --> 31:36.046
But I do know the man
you're referring to.

31:36.114 --> 31:38.782
He was the previous tenant.

31:38.850 --> 31:41.085
A bit of a recluse, judging
by the way he left the place.

31:41.152 --> 31:43.653
Oh, do you know
what happened to him?

31:43.722 --> 31:45.222
No, I'm afraid not.

31:46.657 --> 31:48.592
Thank you for the tea.

31:48.659 --> 31:51.127
Maybe we should go and
wait for the tow truck.

31:51.195 --> 31:52.161
But he did leave behind

31:52.229 --> 31:55.264
a box of
personal effects.

31:55.332 --> 31:57.066
Oh, I'd forgotten all about it.

31:57.134 --> 31:59.268
I mean, it has
been 30 years.

31:59.336 --> 32:01.971
Oh, well, I'd hate
to bother you.

32:02.039 --> 32:03.305
No, you're welcome to it--

32:03.373 --> 32:06.574
well, if your fiancé would
kindly give me a hand.

32:06.642 --> 32:08.276
I believe it's a bit heavy.

32:08.344 --> 32:10.078
I would love to.

32:18.254 --> 32:20.521
Oh, wait here
while I grab a torch.

32:20.589 --> 32:22.123
Oh, delightful.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.125
Okay.

32:42.542 --> 32:44.710
Tell me who you are,

32:44.779 --> 32:46.479
and what you want
with my son--

32:46.546 --> 32:48.815
before you make me
go ruin my wallpaper.

32:48.883 --> 32:50.884
Please, please, ma'am,
I'm-I'm here to help your son.

32:50.951 --> 32:52.952
I'm here to help Hartley.
I'm with the CIA.

32:53.020 --> 32:56.488
So, you're saying you work
for the people who took my son?

32:56.555 --> 32:57.790
Give me your sidearm.

32:57.857 --> 32:59.591
Ma'am, I actually
don't carry a gun.

32:59.659 --> 33:00.893
Hartley should
never have been

33:00.960 --> 33:02.261
sent undercover.

33:02.328 --> 33:03.728
He was a scientist.

33:03.797 --> 33:06.531
When the CIA couldn't bring
him in, they disavowed him.

33:06.599 --> 33:08.801
No one lifted a finger!

33:08.868 --> 33:10.434
They did, they did!
My father, he spent

33:10.502 --> 33:11.869
his entire career
trying to find Hartley.

33:15.974 --> 33:17.942
You're Stephen Bartowski's boy?

33:19.377 --> 33:21.478
You knew my dad?

33:21.546 --> 33:22.814
Of course.

33:22.881 --> 33:25.216
He and Hartley were quite close.

33:28.119 --> 33:30.620
Are you gonna fix my son?

33:38.595 --> 33:41.064
This is the place.

33:42.799 --> 33:44.566
Looks like someone
beat us to it.

33:44.634 --> 33:46.168
Move out.

33:47.670 --> 33:48.770
Not bad.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.985
Great. We're outgunned
and outmanned.

34:05.287 --> 34:06.520
What are you
waiting for, laddie?

34:06.588 --> 34:08.289
Lay down some fire.

34:12.393 --> 34:13.527
Who are these people?

34:13.594 --> 34:14.862
Mercenaries.

34:14.896 --> 34:16.929
Must have followed us.
They're not after you.

34:16.998 --> 34:19.065
They're after the same
thing you came for.

34:19.132 --> 34:20.734
Hartley's spy will.

34:24.804 --> 34:26.273
Oh. Here.

34:26.341 --> 34:27.440
There's a vault in the cellar.

34:27.507 --> 34:29.509
You'll find the
spy will down there.

34:29.577 --> 34:31.577
Go! We can
handle this!

34:31.643 --> 34:34.713
Oh, put down that
damn peashooter.

34:34.781 --> 34:37.616
There's a real gun
in the chest.

34:37.684 --> 34:38.617
There.

34:38.685 --> 34:41.687
I prepared for
something like this.

34:41.755 --> 34:44.190
You know how to feed
one of these things?

34:44.257 --> 34:46.757
Please! You're feeding me.

34:52.664 --> 34:55.065

40:08.779 --> 40:11.346
Mom brought him to the

40:11.414 --> 40:12.347
He's a spy right?

40:12.415 --> 40:13.815
No, not exactly.

40:13.883 --> 40:15.584
He's locked up now,

40:15.651 --> 40:18.087
but Alexei Volkoff is a very
powerful, very evil arms dealer.

40:18.154 --> 40:20.155
Yeah, but he wasn't.
I mean, that's the thing.

40:20.223 --> 40:21.423
Volkoff was a
cover identity.

40:21.491 --> 40:23.192
In reality,
he was just a scientist

40:23.259 --> 40:24.493

Look, the CIA created one of

40:54.122 --> 40:56.123
the most murderous men
in the history of the world.
