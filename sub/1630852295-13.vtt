00:50.015 --> 00:52.000
Bup bup bup.

00:52.002 --> 00:55.004
Susie, can I read you
a poem I wrote for you?

00:56.011 --> 00:58.019
And then she'll say,
maybe she'll say,

00:58.021 --> 01:01.013
"Pepper, I also
wrote you a poem.

01:01.015 --> 01:05.017
Thank you so much for having
the courage to read yours first,

01:05.019 --> 01:10.013
so that I would be able
to share mine with you."

01:10.015 --> 01:11.021
Wait a minute.

01:11.023 --> 01:14.013
Hmm...this way?

01:16.003 --> 01:18.019
I think this is the way
to Susie's.

01:21.015 --> 01:23.008
Bup bup bup.

01:23.010 --> 01:28.003
Susie, can I read you
a poem I wrote for you?

01:28.005 --> 01:29.015
Bup bup bup.

01:29.017 --> 01:30.018
Susie!

01:30.020 --> 01:34.008
Can I read you a poem
I wrote for you?

01:34.010 --> 01:35.015
Bup bup bup.

01:35.017 --> 01:38.002
Susie can I read you a --

01:38.004 --> 01:40.007
Wow, there are three of you?

01:40.009 --> 01:41.021
Nope!
Only child!

01:41.023 --> 01:44.019
My parents took one look at me
and said "That's enough!"

01:44.021 --> 01:46.004
so there's only one
of me.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.004
Well, you know, there's two
other mushrooms

01:48.006 --> 01:49.016
who look just like you.

01:49.018 --> 01:52.017
That's funny,
I've seen two of you, too!

01:52.019 --> 01:55.023
What?! I have brothers?

01:56.001 --> 01:58.004
Wait, no, I've --

01:58.006 --> 02:00.010
Hey, you've been
walking around in circles!

02:00.012 --> 02:02.002
Yeah.

02:02.004 --> 02:05.014
Well, I think I'll maybe walk...
over this way.

02:05.016 --> 02:06.018
Yeah!

02:06.020 --> 02:08.014
Maybe I'll be seeing you.

02:08.016 --> 02:10.005
Uh, yeah!

02:12.014 --> 02:17.003
Hmm, I don't see a road here
unless it's under the fog.

02:17.005 --> 02:20.003
I don't recognize anything,
but that's alright.

02:20.005 --> 02:22.009
Ah!

02:26.012 --> 02:29.015
Oh, you silly Pepper,
it's just an old stump.

02:29.017 --> 02:32.001
Wahh!

02:32.003 --> 02:35.004
Uh, I'm not worried.

02:36.011 --> 02:37.019
Bup bup bup.

02:37.021 --> 02:40.007
Susie,
can I read you a poem?

02:40.009 --> 02:42.007
Oh! Glow bulbs!

02:42.009 --> 02:43.010
This is good.

02:43.012 --> 02:45.001
I can follow the glow bulbs!

02:45.003 --> 02:47.018
Susie has some of these
in her front yard.

02:49.019 --> 02:53.013
It'll take me a while to get
there, but that's not a problem.

02:53.015 --> 02:56.006
If Susie loves me back now,
she'll still love me

02:56.008 --> 02:59.017
back in an hour
or an hour and a half.

02:59.019 --> 03:03.014
I'll just keep following
the glow bulbs.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.014
Oof.

03:04.016 --> 03:07.010
Sorry, Tummy.

03:07.012 --> 03:10.002
Hey, have you been eating
the glow bulbs?

03:10.004 --> 03:12.006
'Cause I seem
to have run out of them.

03:12.008 --> 03:15.005
Ha ha ha!
Are you lost?

03:15.007 --> 03:16.022
Ha ha ha ha.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.014
Maybe a little.

03:18.016 --> 03:20.011
Uh, do you have a head
up there...

03:20.013 --> 03:22.022
or are you just
a jolly tummy?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.018
Ha ha ha,
yes, I have a head.

03:25.020 --> 03:28.011
It's here above the fog.

03:28.013 --> 03:32.011
Can you see up there?
Can you see Susie's house?

03:32.013 --> 03:35.022
I can see her chimney.
Ha ha ha.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.020
Then take me there, Tummy!

03:37.022 --> 03:40.015
Okay!
Ha ha ha!

03:43.008 --> 03:45.010
Hey, hey! Tummy!

03:47.008 --> 03:49.013
Tummy?

03:51.022 --> 03:55.006
Ah!

03:55.008 --> 03:56.017
Dang.

03:56.019 --> 04:00.007
I should have said, "Take me
there slowly, Tummy".

04:03.008 --> 04:04.018
Bup bup bup.

04:04.020 --> 04:06.023
Susie, can I read you --

04:07.001 --> 04:16.005
Wooo-oooo.

04:17.003 --> 04:19.019
Hi, I'm a foghorn!

04:19.021 --> 04:20.021
Yeah.

04:20.023 --> 04:24.023
Wow, that piece of paper
looks heavy.

04:25.001 --> 04:26.012
It's a poem.

04:26.014 --> 04:28.021
Oh, wow,
that poem looks heavy.

04:30.008 --> 04:33.018
Honestly, it didn't feel heavy
until you brought it up.

04:33.020 --> 04:36.017
Ain't that always
the way, huh?

04:36.019 --> 04:40.000
Hey, I have an idea!
Let me carry it for you.

04:43.002 --> 04:45.006
Oh... I guess.

04:45.008 --> 04:47.003
Come on,
gimme, gimme, gimme!

04:47.005 --> 04:49.008
Gimme that sweet poem!

04:49.010 --> 04:55.003
Hmm. To be honest, I'm beginning
to have second thoughts.

04:55.005 --> 04:58.021
Ahh, you got me, I totally
was gonna steal it!

04:58.023 --> 05:00.017
Hahaha.

05:00.019 --> 05:03.005
I'm a thief.

05:03.007 --> 05:05.017
Can you just help me
get to Susie's?

05:05.019 --> 05:08.014
Okay.
Thanks for not turning me in.

05:11.004 --> 05:12.013
Oh, she's over this way.

05:12.015 --> 05:22.000
Wooo-oooo.

05:23.011 --> 05:26.006
Wooo-oooo.

05:26.008 --> 05:28.007
I like
our slow procession.

05:28.009 --> 05:29.011
Yeah.

05:29.013 --> 05:32.022
Wooo-oooo.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.002
Wooo-oooo.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.005
We are taking a really
weird route to Susie's

05:39.007 --> 05:43.015
because I've never
seen this river.

05:43.017 --> 05:45.006
Hey, I don't like rivers!

05:45.008 --> 05:47.007
Fog is my thing!
Not rivers!

05:47.009 --> 05:48.015
Good luck!

05:48.017 --> 05:50.009
Wooo-oo.

05:54.012 --> 05:57.007
A year from now,
you will have a child,

05:57.009 --> 05:59.007
and that child will grow up

05:59.009 --> 06:03.006
to be the Pretzel Maker
of Bremerhaven!

06:03.008 --> 06:04.017
A year from now?

06:04.019 --> 06:06.015
That makes me 11 years old!

06:06.017 --> 06:08.010
Are you sure about that?

06:08.012 --> 06:11.016
Just as sure as this
is the 18th century.

06:11.018 --> 06:15.005
Oh, boy, I gotta tell
Susie about this great news.

06:15.007 --> 06:18.014
Do you know the way
to Susie's place?

06:18.016 --> 06:20.001
Susie's place?

06:20.003 --> 06:21.021
Susie's place.

06:21.023 --> 06:26.007
Oh, brother, I'm in the wrong
enchanted forest again.

06:26.009 --> 06:29.007
So, I'm not gonna
have a child?

06:29.009 --> 06:30.023
Look, just forget
I said that.

06:31.001 --> 06:34.009
Forget that
I was even here.

06:37.002 --> 06:39.021

08:38.013 --> 08:40.013
I don't remember this staircase.

08:40.015 --> 08:43.011
Hmm, maybe I can climb up
these stairs,

08:43.013 --> 08:46.018
and get above the fog
and see Susie's house.

Oh, this is a poem.

08:57.022 --> 09:02.005
Read it to me. I mean,
if you wish to use my stairs,

09:02.007 --> 09:04.023
your emotions
must be shared.

09:06.014 --> 09:09.011
No, it's private.

Does it rhyme?

09:10.017 --> 09:11.021
No.

09:11.023 --> 09:14.007
Then never mind,
I'm not interested anyway.

09:14.009 --> 09:17.007
I only have time
for rhymes.

09:17.009 --> 09:19.020
Well then, why are you called
the Stair <i>Rabbit</i>

09:19.022 --> 09:22.007
instead of
the stair hare?

09:22.009 --> 09:26.018

of that!

09:26.020 --> 09:28.006
Whoa.

09:28.008 --> 09:30.020
Okay, you may use
my stairs.

09:30.022 --> 09:32.001
Thank you.

09:32.003 --> 09:34.003
Does this go to Susie's?

09:34.005 --> 09:37.005
I'm starting to think no one
knows where she lives.

09:37.007 --> 09:39.008
This'll take you
where you need to go.

do these stairs go?

on the stairs for a while now.

Huh?
