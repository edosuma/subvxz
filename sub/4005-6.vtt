12:22.875 --> 12:24.875
FOR OUR FRIEND BROTHER SAM.

12:24.875 --> 12:27.542
PLEASE JOIN HANDS.

12:27.542 --> 12:29.750
PLEASE HEAR OUR PRAYER, LORD,

12:29.750 --> 12:32.250
AS WE GATHER IN YOUR NAME.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.709
[barking]

12:33.709 --> 12:36.000
LORD, WE ASK YOU
TO HEAL OUR BROTHER SAM

12:36.000 --> 12:37.291
AND BRING HIM BACK TO US,

12:37.291 --> 12:38.583
BECAUSE WE NEED HIM.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.500
HE'S YOUR SHINING LIGHT
AMONG US.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.750
HE HELPS US SEE THE WAY.
AMEN.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.750
all: AMEN.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.542
- AND NOW IN THE NAME
OF FORGIVENESS,

12:47.542 --> 12:48.583
LET US SAY A SILENT PRAYER

12:48.583 --> 12:51.458
FOR THE MISGUIDED SINNER
WHO SHOT BROTHER SAM.

12:51.458 --> 12:55.458
[overlapping chatter]

12:55.458 --> 12:57.583
- ANGER WON'T BRING HIM BACK.

12:57.583 --> 13:01.125
- I'D RATHER PREY ON HIM.

13:01.125 --> 13:02.792
- HERE'S WHERE WE ARE.

13:02.792 --> 13:05.750
PROFESSOR GELLAR'S FORMER T.A.,
CARISSA PORTER...

13:05.750 --> 13:07.417
- THE ONE YOU GOT
THE BOXES FROM.

13:07.417 --> 13:10.417
- RIGHT. SHE TOLD US THAT
GELLAR WAS WORKING ON A THEORY,

13:10.417 --> 13:13.667
ABOUT AN EARLY A.D. CULT,
THE ENESSERRETTE, WHO BELIEVED

13:13.667 --> 13:16.625
THAT THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS WAS
NOT ONLY A BIBLICAL PROPHECY,

13:16.625 --> 13:20.125
BUT SOME KIND OF CODE TO BRING
ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.625
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.333
- ACCORDING
TO GELLAR'S PAPERS,

13:23.333 --> 13:25.083
HE THOUGHT
HE HAD DECIPHERED THE CODE.

13:25.083 --> 13:28.208
SEVEN STEPS OR KEYS, EACH
REQUIRING A HUMAN SACRIFICE.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.583
- WE THINK THAT
THE DOOMSDAY TABLEAUS

13:30.583 --> 13:33.417
ARE AN ENACTMENT OF THESE KEYS.

13:33.417 --> 13:35.834
- JESUS.

13:35.834 --> 13:37.375
I THOUGHT THIS CRAZY FUCK
WAS TRYING TO WARN US

13:37.375 --> 13:38.625
ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.041
YOU'RE TELLING ME HE'S TRYING
TO CAUSE IT?

13:40.041 --> 13:41.083
- THERE'S MORE.

13:41.083 --> 13:43.834
WE FOUND A CLIPPING
FROM A COLLEGE NEWSPAPER

13:43.834 --> 13:45.125
FROM A LITTLE OVER
THREE YEARS AGO,

13:45.125 --> 13:48.625
AND IT SAYS THAT GELLAR DID AN
ARTISTIC INSTALLATION ON CAMPUS

13:48.625 --> 13:51.083
DRAWING ATTENTION TO HIS WORK
ON THE ENESSERRETTE CULT.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.667
IT GOT HIM IN HOT WATER
WITH THE UNIVERSITY.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.166
- THE DEAD LAMB
REPRESENTS SACRIFICE,

13:56.166 --> 13:58.792
THE NAKED CHICK REPRESENTS
SINFULNESS, BLAH BLAH BLAH.

13:58.792 --> 14:00.834
IT LOOKS LIKE A PRACTICE RUN
FOR HIS CURRENT WORK.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.083
- IF WE COULD FIND THAT GIRL
IN THE PHOTO,

14:02.083 --> 14:04.000
WHO KNOWS WHAT
SHE COULD TELL US?

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
IS THAT MARKING ON HER LOWER
BACK PART OF THE TABLEAU?

14:07.000 --> 14:08.583
- NOT SURE. WE JUST FOUND THIS
BEFORE YOU WALKED IN.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.333
WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE
TO GO OVER IT IN DETAIL.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.583
- YOU GOT A MAGNIFYING GLASS?

14:11.583 --> 14:13.625
- YEAH.

14:16.667 --> 14:17.917
- HM, LOOKS LIKE A TATTOO.

14:17.917 --> 14:21.041
ONE OF THOSE HINDU
"OM" DEALIOS.

14:21.041 --> 14:23.959
WRONG RELIGION, SWEETIE.

14:25.667 --> 14:28.375
- GOOD FIND, DEB. UM...

14:28.375 --> 14:30.208
WE'LL, UH,
TAKE IT FROM HERE.

14:30.208 --> 14:31.917
- OH, I CAN HELP
IF YOU WANT.

14:31.917 --> 14:33.083
- NO, NO, NO.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.917
UM, YOU'VE GOT A LOT
ON YOUR PLATE, SO...

14:34.917 --> 14:36.208
- IT'S OKAY, DEB,
WE GOT THIS.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.041
WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

14:48.542 --> 14:50.375
- WHAT?

14:50.375 --> 14:52.750
- THE CHICK IN THE PHOTO
IS CARISSA PORTER.

14:52.750 --> 14:55.083
- WHAT?
ARE YOU SURE?

14:55.083 --> 14:56.542
- THE TAT ABOVE HER ASS?

14:56.542 --> 14:59.208
I WAS IN THE VICINITY.

14:59.208 --> 15:01.041
- SHIT.

15:01.041 --> 15:03.250
SHE JUST BECAME
OUR KEY WITNESS.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.750
I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO HOME
WITH HER. DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

15:04.750 --> 15:06.166
- YES, YOU TOLD ME, MOM.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.709
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT ARE
WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT NOW?

15:07.709 --> 15:10.041
- WELL, WE GOTTA FIND OUT
WHAT ELSE CARISSA PORTER KNOWS.

15:10.041 --> 15:11.083
- THAT-- THAT'S FINE.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.625
BUT WE CAN'T LET DEB
KNOW ABOUT THIS,

15:12.625 --> 15:14.208
'CAUSE THAT COULD MAKE THINGS
A LOT HARDER FOR ME.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.083
- LIE TO DEB?
NO WAY.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.917
- OH, SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
TURN YOUR BACK ON YOUR PARTNER?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.583
- OH, NO, NO.
DO NOT PLAY THE PARTNER CARD.

15:19.583 --> 15:21.000
- OF COURSE I'M GONNA PLAY
THE PARTNER CARD.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.333
WHY WOULDN'T I PLAY
THE PARTNER CARD?

15:22.333 --> 15:24.500
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS
ARE EXACTLY WHY THE PARTNER CARD

15:24.500 --> 15:25.625
IS IN THE FUCKING DECK!

15:25.625 --> 15:28.667
- I'M REALLY NOT LIKING YOU
RIGHT NOW.

15:28.667 --> 15:31.750
[chopping sound]

15:47.125 --> 15:49.959
[woman grunting]

15:53.417 --> 15:56.208
[sobbing]

16:10.542 --> 16:13.417
[cries and whimpers]

16:25.083 --> 16:26.333
- DEB, YOU GOT A SEC?

16:26.333 --> 16:27.792
- WHAT'S UP?

16:27.792 --> 16:29.875
- QUINN AND I HAVE TO GO
TO TALLAHASSEE TOMORROW

16:29.875 --> 16:31.959
TO QUESTION CARISSA PORTER.

16:31.959 --> 16:32.875
- I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY
INTERVIEWED HER.

16:32.875 --> 16:35.041
- WE DID.
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

16:35.041 --> 16:37.000
THAT SHE'S THE NAKED WOMAN
IN THE NEWSPAPER PHOTO.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.625
- NO SHIT,
HOW'D YOU FIGURE THAT OUT?

16:38.625 --> 16:42.500
- UH...JUST METICULOUS
POLICE WORK.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.166
- FUCKIN' A.

16:44.166 --> 16:47.166
SHE'S GOTTA BE ABLE TO HELP US
GET CLOSER TO GELLAR.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.834
BUT I CAN'T SPARE YOU GUYS
FOR A WHOLE DAY.

16:48.834 --> 16:50.458
HAVE HER COME HERE.

16:50.458 --> 16:51.375
- WHAT?

16:51.375 --> 16:54.583
- BRING HER INTO THE STATION.

16:54.583 --> 16:55.792
- OH. UM...

16:55.792 --> 16:57.125
I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S GONNA GO FOR THAT.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.333
SHE'S A PROFESSOR.

16:58.333 --> 16:59.500
SHE'S GOT CLASSES TO TEACH.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.041
- FUCK HER CLASSES.

17:01.041 --> 17:05.041
SHE'S A MATERIAL WITNESS IN
A SERIAL MURDER INVESTIGATION.

17:05.041 --> 17:06.583
TELL HER TO GET
HER OM-TATTOOED ASS

17:06.583 --> 17:08.166
INTO THIS STATION
BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON

17:08.166 --> 17:10.125
OR I'LL HAVE HER HAULED IN HERE
IN HANDCUFFS.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.333
TRY IT NICELY FIRST.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.667
- FUCK.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.875
WHAT IF CARISSA SAYS SOMETHING
ABOUT OUR NIGHT TOGETHER?

17:24.875 --> 17:26.083
- I'LL HANDLE IT.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.375
YOU JUST STAY
THE HELL AWAY FROM HER.

17:28.375 --> 17:31.583
- [sighs]

17:31.583 --> 17:34.667
[overlapping chatter]

18:03.417 --> 18:04.583
- HI, JAMIE.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.083
- HI.

18:09.917 --> 18:11.583
HARRISON GO DOWN EASY?

18:11.583 --> 18:13.041
- TOTALLY.

18:13.041 --> 18:14.500
WE WENT TO THE PARK
THIS AFTERNOON.

18:14.500 --> 18:17.166
SO IT WAS LIKE ONE PAGE
OF GOODNIGHT, MOON,

18:17.166 --> 18:19.125
AND THEN THE SANDMAN
DROPPED THE WHOLE BAG ON HIM.

18:19.125 --> 18:21.083
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.208
DEB SAID SHE'D BE BY
THIS WEEKEND

18:23.208 --> 18:24.333
TO GET THE REST OF HER STUFF.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.959
- OH, NO, I'M HAPPY TO DO IT.

18:25.959 --> 18:28.250
THERE WE GO,

18:28.250 --> 18:32.083
ALL FOLDED AND PACKED
WITH VERY LITTLE HOSTILITY.

18:32.083 --> 18:35.208
GUESS I'LL HIT THE ROAD.

18:48.125 --> 18:51.291
I HEARD ABOUT YOUR FRIEND,
BROTHER SAM.

18:51.291 --> 18:52.917
HOW'S HE DOING?

18:52.917 --> 18:55.959
- HE'S, UH...IN A COMA.
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.500
- I'M REALLY SORRY.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.291
HE SEEMED LIKE
A REALLY NICE GUY.

19:02.291 --> 19:05.959
- YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW HIM...
THAT WELL.

19:05.959 --> 19:08.291
IT DEFINITELY SUCKS.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.250
- WELL, I'LL...
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

19:15.250 --> 19:19.375
- GOOD NIGHT.
THANKS.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.250
[door clicks shut]

19:37.709 --> 19:39.959
[silverware clattering]

19:42.750 --> 19:46.375
[sighs]

19:46.375 --> 19:49.125
- WHY IS IT SO HARD
FOR YOU TO ADMIT

19:49.125 --> 19:51.208
YOU CARE ABOUT BROTHER SAM?

19:51.208 --> 19:53.583
- IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.500
WHO IS HE TO ME?

19:55.500 --> 19:57.667
- A FELLOW TRAVELER.

19:57.667 --> 20:00.750
HE WAS A KILLER
AT ONE TIME.

20:00.750 --> 20:03.792
- BUT HE FOUND A NEW PATH,
A PATH I COULD NEVER TAKE.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.166
- IT'S BECAUSE
HE'S TRAVELED BOTH ROADS

20:07.166 --> 20:10.250
THAT HE UNDERSTANDS
THE DARKNESS IN YOU

20:10.250 --> 20:13.041
AND HE SEES THE LIGHT.

20:13.041 --> 20:16.250
I WISH I DID.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.667
MAYBE THINGS
COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.

20:18.667 --> 20:21.208
- "WHAT IF'S" ARE
A WASTE OF TIME.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.750
I'VE ACCEPTED
MY DARK PASSENGER.

20:23.750 --> 20:26.208
- BUT THERE'S MORE TO YOU
THAN THAT.

20:26.208 --> 20:29.000
BROTHER SAM SEES IT,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.917
AND HE'S HELPED YOU SEE IT.

20:31.917 --> 20:34.834
THAT'S WHAT HE IS TO YOU.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.625
- SO IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

20:44.625 --> 20:47.542
- NOPE.

20:47.542 --> 20:49.208
- YOU SURE?

20:49.208 --> 20:51.625
- YEP.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.709
- OKAY.

20:53.709 --> 20:56.834
WELL, AS FAR AS THE SHOOTING AT
DON ALDO'S, YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

20:56.834 --> 21:00.166
THERE'S NO NEED FOR US
TO MEET AGAIN.

21:00.166 --> 21:02.125
- THERE'S ONE MORE THING.

21:02.125 --> 21:04.208
- YES?

21:05.625 --> 21:09.667
- I FEEL LIKE MY WHOLE WORLD
HAS BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.

21:09.667 --> 21:14.125
- THAT'S KIND OF MORE THAN
AN AFTERTHOUGHT.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.208
GO ON.

21:20.917 --> 21:22.500
- FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I FEEL LOST

21:22.500 --> 21:24.291
IN A PLACE THAT'S ALWAYS
FELT LIKE HOME.

21:24.291 --> 21:28.959
I LOOK AT MY CO-WORKERS AND
I SEE THE DOUBT IN THEIR EYES,

21:28.959 --> 21:30.291
AND IT MAKES ME DOUBT MYSELF.

21:30.291 --> 21:33.291
I MEAN, THEY USED
TO BE MY FRIENDS.

21:33.291 --> 21:36.792
NOW THEY'RE MY SUBORDINATES.

21:36.792 --> 21:39.875
IT USED TO BE SIMPLE.

21:39.875 --> 21:43.917
I FEEL LIKE SHIT
ABOUT QUINN.

21:43.917 --> 21:45.959
I THINK HE THINKS THAT...

21:45.959 --> 21:49.125
I DUMPED HIM BECAUSE I THINK
I'M BETTER THAN HIM NOW.

21:49.125 --> 21:50.458
[sighs]

21:50.458 --> 21:52.250
AND I USED TO BE ABLE
TO TALK TO BATISTA,

21:52.250 --> 21:55.250
BUT THAT'S AWKWARD BECAUSE
I MADE LIEUTENANT OVER HIM.

21:57.917 --> 22:01.834
I STILL HAVE DEXTER.

22:01.834 --> 22:03.917
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN CLOSE,
SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

22:06.041 --> 22:08.709
BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT TOO,
BECAUSE...

22:08.709 --> 22:10.917
IT'S WEIRD TO BE
MY BIG BROTHER'S BOSS.

22:12.750 --> 22:15.542
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT
AROUND ANYONE ANYMORE.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.709
- SO DON'T.

22:16.709 --> 22:17.667
- WHAT?

22:17.667 --> 22:19.917
- DON'T ACT.

22:19.917 --> 22:21.041
JUST BE DEBRA.

22:21.041 --> 22:22.583
YOU'RE TOO MUCH IN YOUR HEAD,

22:22.583 --> 22:24.542
YOU'RE--YOU'RE THINKING
TOO MUCH.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.792
JUST DO THE JOB, LIVE YOUR LIFE,

22:26.792 --> 22:28.875
AND GIVE IT ALL A CHANCE
TO SORT ITSELF OUT.

22:28.875 --> 22:32.542
- I DON'T KNOW IF I KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

22:32.542 --> 22:35.166
- WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING
RIGHT NOW

22:35.166 --> 22:37.417
IF YOU HADN'T GOTTEN
THIS PROMOTION?

22:37.417 --> 22:38.959
- IF I WASN'T LIEUTENANT?

22:38.959 --> 22:41.166
IF I DIDN'T HAVE BRIEFINGS
AND REPORTS

22:41.166 --> 22:42.667
AND MEETINGS
COMING OUT OF MY ASS?

22:42.667 --> 22:46.041
- YEAH.

22:46.041 --> 22:48.959
- I WOULD PROBABLY THROW
A HOUSEWARMING PARTY

22:48.959 --> 22:50.875
AT MY NEW BEACH HOUSE.

22:50.875 --> 22:52.125
- [laughs]

22:52.125 --> 22:53.458
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT MORE FUN

22:53.458 --> 22:54.834
THAN WORRYING ABOUT ALL
THIS OTHER STUFF.

22:54.834 --> 22:58.250
- FOR A SHRINK,
YOU'RE NOT THAT ANNOYING.

22:58.250 --> 23:01.000
- THANKS.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.083
NOT THAT YOU'D EVER NEED
A SHRINK, BUT...

23:05.083 --> 23:08.000
YOU MIGHT NEED A BOOKMARK.

23:24.291 --> 23:26.208
- I WOULD GUESS IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT PEOPLE WHO PARTY ALL NIGHT

23:26.208 --> 23:28.959
ALSO DON'T GET UP
IN THE MORNING.

23:28.959 --> 23:31.875
BUT I'M FINDING IT
VERY INCONVENIENT.

23:31.875 --> 23:34.417
COME ON, LEO.
WAKE UP.

23:34.417 --> 23:37.542
[police radio chatter]

23:53.083 --> 23:54.750
- COPS, MAN.

23:54.750 --> 23:55.750
- OH, FUCK.

23:55.750 --> 23:59.500
OH, FUCK.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.625
- FUCK YOU, MAN,

24:00.625 --> 24:02.333
- HEY, BEHAVE.

24:02.333 --> 24:04.834
THAT'S MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN.

24:04.834 --> 24:08.542
NOW I KNOW THE LOCOS ARE THE
SUPPLIER FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

24:08.542 --> 24:11.625
AND I'M GUESSING THAT YOU,
BEING A SAVVY CONSUMER,

24:11.625 --> 24:14.083
HAVE KEPT ABREAST ON WHO'S
