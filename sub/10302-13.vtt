And now, for your Christmas
viewing pleasure...

02:09.199 --> 02:10.758
...Channel 2 presents...

02:11.000 --> 02:15.073
- Anything but It's a Wonderful Life.
...It's a Wonderful Life.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.556
It's a Wonderful Life.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.189
It's a Wonderful Life.

02:21.280 --> 02:25.193
- It's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
- All right!

02:25.440 --> 02:29.069
Right after It's a Wonderful Life.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.113
Dad, it's Christmas Eve.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.993
Shouldn't you be out
shooing the homeless or something?

02:36.320 --> 02:37.719
Quite the noble gesture, son...

02:37.920 --> 02:41.469
...but Christmas Eve is a time that you
should spend with your loved ones.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.638
I'd say that's enough time.
Go away, I'm trying to watch TV.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.115
Dad, every year, you and Mom
sit here on the couch...

02:51.360 --> 02:53.430
...and end up fighting over
what to watch.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.473
Why don't you take her on down
to Almost Steak and treat her...

02:56.680 --> 02:59.558
...to the all-you-can-keep-down
Christmas special?

03:00.640 --> 03:03.359
Then where would we go
for our anniversary?

03:04.680 --> 03:08.309
- It's Christmas. There's nothing on.
- Of course there is. I got 40 channels.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.312
The spirit of Christmas
has gotta be on.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.910
And now live, the great ladies
of the Squared Circle present...

03:14.160 --> 03:16.628
...Christmas oil wrestling.

03:19.960 --> 03:21.188
See that?

03:21.680 --> 03:23.830
Look at those chestnuts.

03:34.760 --> 03:37.911
He won't budge, Kel.
What are we gonna do?

03:38.160 --> 03:41.914
Well, you're the one who wanted to get
him a big old jukebox for Christmas.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.588
Hey, if a really cool watch
had fallen off the truck...

03:44.800 --> 03:46.518
...I would've gotten him that instead.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.272
I just hope they like it.

03:49.520 --> 03:52.557
Well, they should. It's got
all those geezer records on it.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.793
It's even got one from way back
when Cher used to sing with her son.

03:59.080 --> 04:02.072
Well, we can't leave it
in this freezing garage all night.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.274
We can take it upstairs
and hide it in one of our rooms.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.399
Oh, no problem.
Just let me eats me spinach first.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.757
We'll do it together.
We'll just take it up behind Dad.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.918
Look, he's watching oil wrestling.
He seems to be pretty focused.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.671
She's down!

04:22.240 --> 04:25.550
Her breasts are touching!
Her breasts are touching!

04:28.680 --> 04:31.911
It's kind of nice to see Dad
getting in the Christmas spirit.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.590
- Okay, come on, let's do it.
- Okay.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.712
Al, guess what I've got.

04:47.960 --> 04:50.428
You got a Christmas present
for me?

04:50.680 --> 04:51.999
No.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.629
But I could go back out again.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.468
Do you have any money?

04:56.720 --> 05:00.030
Well, I was saving up for a bullet.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.829
That can be from me.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.190
- Is this wrestling?
- No, Peg. It's C-SPAN.

05:08.440 --> 05:10.795
That's Sandra Day O'Connor
and Ruth Bader Ginsburg...

05:11.000 --> 05:12.911
...settling their differences.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.071
Of course it's wrestling.

05:15.360 --> 05:18.557
- Well, you know, I don't really...
- Peg, I know what you're going to do.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.796
You're going to say,
"Is this all that's on?"

05:21.000 --> 05:23.195
Then you'll change it
because you know I like it.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.992
Al, that's just not true.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.156
Is this all that's on?

05:31.560 --> 05:35.519
Yes, Peg. It's Christmas Eve.
It's all that's on, and I like it.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.876
- Well, change it.
- Fine.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.552
Oh, look.
It's a Wonderful Life.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.318
Peg, I hate this movie!

05:44.520 --> 05:46.317
How can you hate
It's a Wonderful Life?

05:46.560 --> 05:48.869
Because it's a horrible life.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.432
You know why
they never made a sequel?

05:51.640 --> 05:53.949
Because when the guy came back,
he killed himself.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.837
And this time
he took that angel with him.

05:57.040 --> 06:01.158
This must be written by a woman.
This stinks. It bites. It blows.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.152
But if you wanna watch it, Peg...

06:04.840 --> 06:07.957
- Oh, never mind. Just turn it.
- Good.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.674
I told you there's nothing.
I'm going back to wrestling.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.995
Honey, how come
you never wrestle with me?

06:17.240 --> 06:19.913
Because I end up on top of you
or you end up on top of me...

06:20.120 --> 06:22.236
...and either way I lose.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.279
- Kel.
- What?

06:27.520 --> 06:29.431
It's on my foot.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.591
Which foot?

06:33.600 --> 06:35.079
The one that's flat as your head.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.236
Help me back out the door
with this thing.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.559
Your stocking's gonna be as empty
as your bed, young man.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.031
Damn carollers.

06:53.280 --> 06:56.158
You know, I have just one thing
to say about oil wrestling.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.470
- What?
- Do we have to watch this?

06:58.680 --> 07:00.193
You know, Peg.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.914
What is it? You look over,
you see a smile on my face...

07:03.120 --> 07:04.758
...you say, "I can't have this"?

07:05.120 --> 07:09.398
No, Al. I just thought it would be nice
if we could enjoy something together.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.269
We tried that on our honeymoon, Peg.
Remember how we cried?

07:14.120 --> 07:16.395
- Just change the channel.
- Fine.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.278
Oh, now, there you go.
You're going too fast.

07:20.520 --> 07:22.351
Come on, Al. What was that?

07:22.600 --> 07:25.273
What was that? What was that?

07:25.600 --> 07:27.591
A Bewitched with Dick York,
not Dick Sargent.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.950
A Gilligan where
the gorilla came to the island.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.357
A Full House Christmas story, where
they were snowed-in at the airport.

07:33.560 --> 07:36.028
And a study of the Amazonian
catfish's mating habits...

07:36.240 --> 07:38.515
...with Philippe,
not Jacques Cousteau.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.077
You can see all that...

07:44.320 --> 07:47.915
...and yet you can't see
the rim around the toilet?

07:52.120 --> 07:54.680
I see what I wanna see, Peg.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.876
It's me.

08:03.040 --> 08:04.951
And I don't wanna see that.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.435
Marcie, are you having
a Christmas party this year?

08:07.680 --> 08:08.908
Nope. Sorry.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.351
- By the way, can I borrow some ice?
- Sure. Help yourself.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.915
It's a shame you're not having
that Christmas party.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.678
I had a good time at that last one.

08:16.880 --> 08:20.236
Remember, I got 95 cocktail weenies
in my mouth?

08:20.680 --> 08:23.478
Yeah, that was real funny, Al.

08:29.280 --> 08:33.511
You know, I would've got 96 in there
if I didn't have to sneeze.

08:34.440 --> 08:38.592
Hey, you remember the look
on your boss's face?

08:39.400 --> 08:41.833
I wish you were having a party.
I really enjoyed it.

08:42.039 --> 08:46.318
It's a shame too, because I got a whole
new batch of dwarf jokes this year.

08:47.240 --> 08:50.357
That makes me all the sadder
that we're not.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.717
- Can I take this chair?
- Sure, go ahead.

08:54.840 --> 08:58.150
Say, what are you guys
doing for Christmas?

08:58.400 --> 09:01.153
You know, I like to spend my time
with the less fortunate...

09:01.400 --> 09:04.039
...so I'll be staying home with Al.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.435
- What about you guys?
- Oh, nothing.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.871
We'll just be at home
having a quiet evening.

09:15.440 --> 09:18.750
Hey, Marcie, great blowout!

09:22.360 --> 09:24.590
Damn shame about that party.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.078
- Give me the remote.
- Here we go.

09:27.320 --> 09:30.630
I know what you're gonna do. You're
gonna go real slow and aggravate me.

09:30.840 --> 09:34.674
- Please don't do this, Peg.
- I'll go fast. I promise.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.354
This is PBS.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.955
And if you want more
bad English television...

09:39.200 --> 09:42.590
...that your friends will insist is better
than bad American television...

09:42.840 --> 09:46.435
...please send your pledges in either
cash, cheque or canned food to...

09:46.640 --> 09:49.359
- Pookie.
- What, Al?

09:49.600 --> 09:52.114
Just out of curiosity,
why are watching this?

09:52.360 --> 09:54.749
- Well, you know, l...
- Turn it!

09:56.080 --> 09:57.752
Fine.

09:58.120 --> 10:01.590
- There, I Love Lucy.
- I hate Lucy.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.791
The real star was Fred. They should
have killed off Ethel and Lucy...

10:06.000 --> 10:08.275
...and that illegal alien.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.393
They should've made Fred single
and called it Mertz's World.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.278
But if you wanna watch it.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.034
All right, Kel, now look.
This is what we're gonna do:

10:23.280 --> 10:26.397
You're gonna tie this rope around
the jukebox. I'll go upstairs.

10:26.640 --> 10:29.518
- And when you're ready, I'll pull it up.
- Okay.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.150
We wouldn't be having this problem
if we had just used a seesaw.

10:35.440 --> 10:39.513
And I wouldn't be having this problem
if Dad had used a condom. Just tie it.

10:51.720 --> 10:55.679
God, is that Michael Bolton
screaming "Silent Night"?

10:56.560 --> 11:00.519
What's his next number gonna be?
"Hark! The Hairy Angel Sings"?

11:00.760 --> 11:04.514
- You know, you don't like anything.
- Starting with you!

11:05.600 --> 11:07.318
Merry Christmas.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.590
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.196
Damn, I wish the D'Arcys were
having a Christmas party this year.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.638
Hey, Al.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.710
Do you mind if we borrow
the rest of these chairs?

11:26.960 --> 11:28.518
Oh, sure, buddy.

11:28.760 --> 11:32.594
- No Christmas party this year, huh?
- No, afraid not.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.718
- Say, can we take the table?
- Sure.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.908
Any beer?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.629
Gonna have sex
with the wife tonight, huh?

11:42.760 --> 11:45.035
You'll need a couple of six packs then.
Want a bag?

11:45.280 --> 11:49.239
- No, I'll just carry it.
- No, I meant a bag for your wife.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.274
No, no, thanks.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.232
What are you gonna do?
Just stay home?

11:58.480 --> 12:01.870
Yeah, yeah.
Just me and the little lady...

12:02.120 --> 12:04.315
...and your chairs
and table and stuff.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.198
See you.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.956
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd swear they were having a party.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.473
All right, Kel.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.995
- Did you tie the rope on the jukebox?
- Yep.

12:18.240 --> 12:20.515
Okay. Now toss it to me.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.830
The jukebox?

12:25.400 --> 12:27.277
The rope, you lug nut.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.836
Gotcha. Ready?

12:39.480 --> 12:41.198
Okay. Now...

12:41.440 --> 12:44.557
...pull on it and make sure it's tight.
- Oh, all right.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.674
Why did you pull on the rope
that way?

13:01.400 --> 13:05.951
Because I wanted to make sure
that it was tight on your end too.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.639
- Upstairs.
- But...

13:08.880 --> 13:11.110
- Get upstairs.
- Okay.

13:14.520 --> 13:18.069
Who's that riding in the sleigh?

13:18.320 --> 13:21.869
Who's that firing along the way?

13:22.120 --> 13:25.874
Who's roughing up bums
On Christmas Day?

13:26.120 --> 13:28.031
- Psycho Dad
- Psycho Dad

13:28.280 --> 13:29.918
- Psycho Dad
- Psycho Dad

13:30.160 --> 13:32.879
- Psycho Dad
- Psycho Dad

13:33.120 --> 13:36.396
Look, Peg, it's the Christmas episode
of Psycho Dad.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.995
- Oh, not again.
- Peg, it's a classic.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.998
This is where you get to know
how he got the reindeer heads...

13:42.200 --> 13:43.519
...on the walls of his cabin.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.672
Merry Christmas.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.430
- Who was that?
- I don't know.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.958
- AI, I am not watching Psycho Dad.
- Peg!

13:55.200 --> 13:58.112
- I'm turning it.
- Well, then I'm going to the bathroom.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.317
And I really hate this commercial.

14:07.520 --> 14:11.433
You know, Peg, I could swear I heard
noises coming from the D'Arcys'.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.439
I think they got a party going on.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.477
Oh, don't be silly, Al.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.871
You know if they had a party,
they surely would've invited you.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.111
Well, that's true.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.796
Say, Peg.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.350
Did you have that hat on
before I went to the bathroom?

14:46.240 --> 14:48.834
Why, yes. Yes, I did.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.435
You know, Al Bundy,
you never look at me.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.148
Yes, I do.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.153
Yeah, I remember it now.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.715
Switch the channel, will you?

15:01.880 --> 15:04.678
The Christian Shopping Network.

15:04.920 --> 15:09.198
Have your next supper
on our Last Supper plates.

15:09.440 --> 15:14.514
Service for 13, only $49. 95.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.157
Okay, I'm ready.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.198
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna retie your knot.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.351
Now, don't lift it until I say so.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.399
- Don't what?
- Lift it.

15:37.720 --> 15:41.076
Kelly!
Kelly, let me down, you moron.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.197
Let me down!

15:43.440 --> 15:45.112
Okay.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.831
Are you down?

15:59.080 --> 16:02.390
Yes. And so are you.

16:03.840 --> 16:07.276
Wait. Don't pull it, Bud.
I tied it to the...

16:08.000 --> 16:09.228
Dresser.

16:16.440 --> 16:19.477
And now the Black Entertainment
Channel presents.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.517
It's a Malcolm Xmas.

16:21.760 --> 16:25.150
Oh, come on, Peg!

16:26.200 --> 16:29.431
I can't stand it anymore.
Give me the remote.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.868
Al, you're going too fast again.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.519
Oh, this just isn't working.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.513
I go too slow. You go too fast.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.990
Gee, what does that remind you of?

16:41.240 --> 16:43.196
Let's just try this together, shall we?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.877
You're taking up
more than half the remote.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.719
Well, you're taking up
more than half the couch.

16:49.400 --> 16:52.153
For those of you who missed
the first 53 airings...

16:52.400 --> 16:56.871
...NBC is proud to present
Cheers, the final episode.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.997
What does Cheers
have to do with Christmas?

16:59.200 --> 17:01.714
What does NBC
have to do with television?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.228
- Change it.
- Change it.

17:06.440 --> 17:09.954
No, not Sally Struthers
Feeds the Third World Channel.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.428
Sally, open your purse up.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.200
I'm sure there's enough
Ding Dongs and Ho Hos in there...

17:14.400 --> 17:16.960
...to start a new 7-Eleven.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.877
That's all these starving kids need,
Sally standing there saying:

17:21.079 --> 17:22.752
"Are you gonna finish that?"

17:28.680 --> 17:30.352
- Change it.
- Change it.

17:30.880 --> 17:35.635
Oh, this is the TV-movie version
of It's a Wonderful Life.

17:35.880 --> 17:40.317
It's from a female perspective.
Starring Suzanne Pleshette.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.516
Who plays the female?

17:50.200 --> 17:51.633
Merry Christmas.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.240
Okay, Al.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.515
Guess who's under the mistletoe.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.270
She pecked me, Peg.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.356
Now I know you're having
a party over there.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.710
I am too.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.268
Do you have any contraceptives?

18:17.800 --> 18:21.839
Well, I got a magazine
with Whoopi Goldberg on the cover.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.191
That'll do.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.996
And to all a good night.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.956
I am almost positive that they're
having a party over there.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.519
Now on Home Shopping Channel, we're
offering this gold-plated necklace.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.751
We've been offering it at $49...

18:50.000 --> 18:53.197
...but for the next 10 minutes
you can buy it for 49 cents.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.432
Look what they put on TV.
Look how hideous this stuff is.

18:56.680 --> 18:59.069
Do they actually think
that women'll go for this?

18:59.320 --> 19:02.153
Yes, I'd like three please.

19:02.400 --> 19:03.833
Yes.

19:04.080 --> 19:08.631
Oh, yes. I would love a Brazilian
Christmas-tree emerald ring.

19:08.880 --> 19:13.317
How dare you try to sell this crap
to women who might actually wear it?

19:14.160 --> 19:17.675
Hey, guys, you guys still got
that Pocket Fisherman?

19:20.160 --> 19:21.957
Happy birthday.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.033
- Who was that?
- Kelly.

19:27.760 --> 19:31.799
A&E, the Arts and Entertainment
Channel, presents.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.713
It's a Hitler Christmas.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.394
Arts and Entertainment Channel?
We had that blocked.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.916
There's just a few stations left.
Let's keep going.

19:41.160 --> 19:45.950
Now available on CD,
cassette and yes, 8-track.

19:46.200 --> 19:47.792
It's a Country Christmas.

19:48.040 --> 19:52.795
Hear such hits as.
"Let's Put the Lights on the Trailer."

19:53.000 --> 19:57.357
Let's put the lights on the trailer

19:57.760 --> 20:01.435
"Is That Rudolph's Nose or Daddy's?"

20:02.080 --> 20:06.119
Is that Rudolph's nose or Daddy's?

20:06.440 --> 20:10.433
"Grandma's Frozen
on the Porch Swing."

20:11.720 --> 20:15.759
Grandma's frozen
On the porch swing

20:24.040 --> 20:28.636
See, I told you it would be easier
if we both did the pulling.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.233
Oh, great, Kel.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.113
Now who's gonna be upstairs
to lift it through the window...

20:33.320 --> 20:36.232
...since we're down here?
- Oh, you're right.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.516
Hey, I'll go do it.

20:49.360 --> 20:53.194
- I was watching that.
- That's it. That's it. I've had it, Peg.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.398
Every year we sit here.
Every year it's the same thing.

20:56.640 --> 20:59.552
TV at Christmastime reeks.
I wish they should just shut it off.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.718
I wish there wasn't any
such thing as TV.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.713
Oh, my God, Peg, the power's off.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.792
What are we gonna do, Peg?
There's no TV!

21:13.520 --> 21:17.149
- Well, we could cuddle.
- Be serious, Peg!

21:17.880 --> 21:20.633
There's no TV. Now I'm sorry
I said that about the TV.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.075
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:26.040 --> 21:29.510
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.599
- What are we gonna watch?
- I don't know, there's nothing on.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.678
Everything stinks.
They ought to just shut it off.

21:39.800 --> 21:43.713
Mom, Dad.
We have something to tell you.

21:44.080 --> 21:47.197
Yeah. We're really sorry...

21:47.400 --> 21:50.676
...but this is the only thing left...
- Hey, now.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.438
You kids bought us a record?

21:55.520 --> 21:58.318
- Yeah, we got you a record.
- Yeah, that's what we got for you.

21:58.960 --> 22:02.794
Oh, Nat King Cole
sings "The Christmas Song."

22:03.000 --> 22:07.198
It's been so long
since I heard Nat without Natalie.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.351
I'll put it on.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.753
So did you get us anything?

22:14.000 --> 22:17.788
Why, yes, honey, we did.
There you go.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.429
- And, Bud.
- Yeah, Ma?

22:22.840 --> 22:24.273
Merry Christmas.

22:29.480 --> 22:34.270
- Oh, kids.
- It really is a wonderful life.
