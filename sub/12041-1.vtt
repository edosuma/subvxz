00:01.428 --> 00:04.420
"The names of persons and
organizations in this movie"

00:04.564 --> 00:07.727
"have been partially changed."

00:10.470 --> 00:14.634
"Produced by Taka Ichise"

00:17.477 --> 00:21.504
"Directed by Koji Shiraishi"

00:27.320 --> 00:33.418
This video documentary is deemed
too disturbing for public viewing.

00:37.430 --> 00:41.093
These are books written by
Masafumi Kobayashi, a journalist

00:41.301 --> 00:47.103
who had been chronicling
supernatural phenomenon since 1995.

00:48.842 --> 00:52.300
He gathered accounts
of strange occurrences...

00:52.445 --> 00:56.472
in his pursuit of horrifying and
unsolvable mysteries.

00:58.351 --> 01:01.787
Once he'd begun using video
in his research

01:01.955 --> 01:05.982
he was able to compile his research
on to videotapes.

01:07.594 --> 01:08.822
That bomb shelter?

01:08.962 --> 01:11.157
Yes. It's in there.

01:14.868 --> 01:16.836
I saw it over there.

01:17.103 --> 01:20.971
It running in the woods very quickly

01:21.474 --> 01:25.410
This is where you saw the ghost...

01:25.545 --> 01:26.477
Was it suicide?

01:26.613 --> 01:29.946
Yes. I saw him in the fender mirror.

01:32.452 --> 01:33.783
This is where...

01:33.920 --> 01:38.482
a family of five was massacred.

01:41.794 --> 01:45.389
In April 2004...

01:45.865 --> 01:48.527
Kobayashi finished his latest...

01:48.668 --> 01:50.693
video documentary, "The Curse".

01:50.937 --> 01:52.404
This has to have some connection.

01:53.873 --> 01:56.637
But soon after that...

02:00.380 --> 02:05.647
At night on April 12,
Kobayashi's house burned down.

02:20.266 --> 02:24.498
Later his wife, Keiko was found dead
in the remains.

02:26.406 --> 02:30.809
But Kobayashi wasn't found.
He was declared missing.

02:33.079 --> 02:36.674
Masafumi Kobayashi
had mysteriously vanished.

02:38.017 --> 02:40.884
His video, "The Curse"...

02:41.521 --> 02:45.958
reveals a truth too astounding
for us to imagine.

03:17.957 --> 03:20.824
"I want the truth."

03:20.960 --> 03:23.952
"No matter how terrifying
I want the truth."

03:24.264 --> 03:28.132
"Masafumi Kobayashi."

03:43.516 --> 03:49.614
"November 12, 2002, Koganei, Tokyo"

03:53.092 --> 03:56.858
"Masafumi Kobayashi,
reporter of the supernatural."

03:59.165 --> 04:04.432
The spooky voices you mentioned...
What kind of voices were they?

04:05.471 --> 04:09.407
It sounded like babies' voices.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.339
Babies' voices...

04:11.611 --> 04:13.602
"Ryoko Okui, housewife"

04:13.746 --> 04:15.941
When did it start?

04:17.283 --> 04:20.218
A couple of months ago.

04:27.293 --> 04:30.456
The sound comes from over there.

04:30.630 --> 04:33.565
Who lives next door?

04:33.766 --> 04:39.796
A woman in her 40s and her boy,
aged between 6 and 9.

04:39.939 --> 04:41.406
There are two of them.

04:41.674 --> 04:46.111
They moved in about half a year ago.

04:46.245 --> 04:49.942
That was the only time that
I saw the boy.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.483
I haven't seen him since.

04:53.019 --> 04:58.116
I see the mother every now and then
when she goes out.

04:58.257 --> 05:00.282
But she doesn't greet me.

05:01.260 --> 05:05.924
I'm a bit scared. I don't want
my girl involved, either.

05:09.402 --> 05:11.427
Let's go to the neighbor's.

05:24.584 --> 05:25.676
Let's go in.

05:29.489 --> 05:31.081
What a mess!

05:36.462 --> 05:37.827
Hello?

05:40.133 --> 05:41.566
Anybody home?

05:52.245 --> 05:57.740
I happened to be in the neighborhood
doing some research and...

05:57.884 --> 06:00.011
What kind of way is that
to talk to me?

06:04.190 --> 06:07.887
How can you talk to me like that?

06:08.227 --> 06:11.719
May I have a few minutes
of your time...

06:11.864 --> 06:13.161
How can you?

06:13.633 --> 06:16.830
My name's Kobayashi and...

06:22.575 --> 06:23.735
Impossible.

06:29.916 --> 06:31.440
Give me a break.

06:55.174 --> 06:58.439
"The strange sound was recorded
on video tape."

07:01.614 --> 07:03.081
Let's begin.

07:06.385 --> 07:10.651
Can you tell us what the sonic
analysis revealed?

07:10.790 --> 07:12.052
Okay.

07:12.825 --> 07:16.158
We have the spectrographic analysis
of the sound.

07:16.362 --> 07:19.798
It has a band of noise
all the way through it.

07:19.932 --> 07:23.163
But here, there's a unique signal.

07:23.569 --> 07:26.470
I'll play it back for comparison.

07:26.639 --> 07:32.236
"The unprocessed audio signal."

07:34.046 --> 07:36.139
This one's noise-reduced.

07:36.382 --> 07:42.810
"The processed audio signal."

07:43.623 --> 07:48.583
As you can hear it's like
some kind of animal sound.

07:50.696 --> 07:52.493
I have enhanced the signal.

07:53.132 --> 07:54.656
Listen carefully.

08:00.239 --> 08:05.836
A cat meows sequentially
but this sound isn't like that.

08:05.978 --> 08:09.846
What's interesting about
this sound is...

08:10.349 --> 08:15.616
that it doesn't repeat like a cat's
meow, it ends with an inhale.

08:15.821 --> 08:19.222
That's the characteristic of
a human baby voice.

08:19.358 --> 08:21.519
On closer examination

08:21.661 --> 08:27.566
it sounds like the voices of
more than 5 babies.

08:31.037 --> 08:34.131
Several days after your visit...

08:34.273 --> 08:38.869
they moved out of that house.

08:39.412 --> 08:43.075
What? They moved out?

08:43.282 --> 08:47.275
How about the strange voices?

08:47.420 --> 08:49.888
Do you still hear the baby voices?

08:50.222 --> 08:55.091
Not since they moved out.

09:18.718 --> 09:23.417
So her name is Junko Ishii.

09:38.971 --> 09:41.963
Come here, Miyajima!

10:05.331 --> 10:07.094
Excuse us now.

10:21.480 --> 10:25.246
They died 5 days later.

10:27.520 --> 10:33.891
Mrs. Okui lost control of her car
when she was driving.

10:34.627 --> 10:38.529
The car went over the divider
into the incoming traffic...

10:51.077 --> 10:54.911
"Footage from a TV variety program,
aired on August 3, 2003"

10:55.214 --> 10:56.977
Good evening, everybody!

10:57.149 --> 10:58.377
Good evening.

10:58.517 --> 10:59.814
Very good, everybody.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.250
Let me introduce you to

11:02.388 --> 11:05.221
Mr. Koichi Hirotsu, the psychic.

11:05.357 --> 11:07.484
Thank you very much.

11:07.626 --> 11:10.925
Can you tell us
how the experiment proceeds?

11:11.063 --> 11:17.662
The first experiment deals
with clairvoyance.

11:18.070 --> 11:20.538
"Experiment 1, Clairvoyance"

11:21.107 --> 11:23.268
In each of these containers

11:23.409 --> 11:26.207
there's a piece of paper.

11:26.345 --> 11:28.336
It has a drawing on it.

11:28.481 --> 11:31.609
I want you to imagine what's drawn.

11:31.751 --> 11:33.776
"First question"

11:35.054 --> 11:38.023
10 children with ESP abilities
from all over Japan.

11:38.290 --> 11:40.724
We're about to witness their powers!

11:41.927 --> 11:44.589
They all look kind of nervous.

11:48.768 --> 11:53.467
Everybody, concentrate right here.

11:53.639 --> 11:56.870
Try to envision the paper
in the container.

11:57.009 --> 12:00.536
You'll get a vision in your head.

12:01.013 --> 12:04.244
None of us know...

12:04.383 --> 12:06.544
what's drawn on the paper.

12:15.594 --> 12:19.587
One of them is starting
to draw what she sees.

12:19.732 --> 12:23.566
"One of them is starting
to draw what she sees"

12:26.205 --> 12:27.229
Can she really see it?

12:27.373 --> 12:31.207
Let's open the container

12:31.343 --> 12:33.208
and take a look at the paper.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.012
What's on the paper?

12:41.921 --> 12:45.379
The answer is a double circle.

12:45.558 --> 12:47.822
But not just a double circle.

12:47.960 --> 12:52.294
Each circle has two points

12:52.431 --> 12:54.797
where the line is broken.

12:54.934 --> 12:56.925
It's a complicated shape.

12:57.102 --> 12:58.364
Did anybody get it right?

12:58.838 --> 13:00.806
"Results"

13:03.909 --> 13:07.367
You there...

13:07.580 --> 13:09.104
She got it right!

13:09.582 --> 13:11.015
Kana Yano

13:11.383 --> 13:13.374
can you show us what you drew?

13:15.654 --> 13:18.179
Take a good look, everybody.

13:18.724 --> 13:23.457
It's drawn with extreme accuracy.

13:26.232 --> 13:28.700
Even the scale is accurate.

13:28.834 --> 13:31.803
This is incredible!

13:32.972 --> 13:34.132
Kana Yano...

13:34.273 --> 13:36.969
She gave correct answers to

13:37.109 --> 13:39.737
all the questions up to 4.

13:40.646 --> 13:42.375
"Fifth question"

13:42.648 --> 13:46.175
Will Kana give an correct answer
to the fifth question, too?

13:50.723 --> 13:54.819
Kana's already drawing something.

13:56.862 --> 13:58.887
"Results"

13:59.098 --> 14:02.033
Show us what you've got, everybody.

14:08.407 --> 14:12.400
The answer to the question
looks like this.

14:12.544 --> 14:14.034
It's totally different.

14:14.513 --> 14:17.539
"It means Star in Russian"

14:20.920 --> 14:23.855
I guess this one was difficult.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.684
Maybe she's tired.

14:25.925 --> 14:31.625
Next we'll make water materialize
in sealed bottles.

14:33.032 --> 14:35.762
It's called materialization.

14:36.235 --> 14:42.231
It is done by telekinetically
envisioning water in the bottle.

14:42.675 --> 14:44.267
Let's do it.

14:46.045 --> 14:48.513
"Begin experiment"

14:51.917 --> 14:55.648
This requires intense concentration.

14:55.788 --> 14:57.278
And now...

14:58.691 --> 15:02.787
you're about to witness a miracle
performed by Kana!

15:04.296 --> 15:08.164
Look, Kana's getting some water!

15:08.867 --> 15:13.167
Can you see it?

15:13.305 --> 15:16.968
At the bottom of the bottle...
water's gathering out of nowhere!

15:19.778 --> 15:25.614
Of course, there's no false bottom
on the bottle, nor the table.

15:25.751 --> 15:27.309
It's the same girl again.

15:33.625 --> 15:34.683
What were you thinking

15:34.994 --> 15:36.393
when you did this?

15:37.229 --> 15:39.459
I thought about water.

15:39.631 --> 15:41.826
When the water materialized...

15:42.001 --> 15:45.368
did you feel something different?

15:45.504 --> 15:47.028
Were you hot or numb?

15:47.206 --> 15:49.037
I had a headache.

15:51.510 --> 15:52.670
My, God!

15:53.145 --> 15:55.340
What is this thing?

15:55.581 --> 15:57.412
Some kind of hair?

15:57.950 --> 16:03.183
Yes. I guess she materialized it
together with the water.

16:04.223 --> 16:08.853
What was it that mysteriously
appeared in the bottle?

16:09.161 --> 16:13.188
Tests done on the water
that Kana produced, have come in.

16:13.332 --> 16:15.300
"Professor Takaaki Yuhara, DSc"

16:15.968 --> 16:18.163
The major component is water.

16:18.837 --> 16:22.739
We found animal plankton
which suggests that

16:22.875 --> 16:28.245
it's fresh water from either
a river or a lake.

16:28.647 --> 16:33.880
The hair in the water is
indeed that of an animal.

16:34.086 --> 16:39.388
It could be human hair, but because
there's no medulla development...

16:39.525 --> 16:42.983
it could be from a newborn baby.

16:48.534 --> 16:52.630
"August 27, Fuchu, Tokyo"

16:55.340 --> 16:59.640
"Kobayashi interviewed
Kana's parents."

17:00.746 --> 17:01.713
Hello.

17:02.181 --> 17:03.375
Thanks for coming.

17:04.116 --> 17:07.142
She's been sleeping all day?

17:08.053 --> 17:10.351
Since after lunch.

17:10.489 --> 17:14.152
"Kana Yano,
the psychic who appeared on TV."

17:14.560 --> 17:20.089
She's had a slight fever
since those TV experiments.

17:20.332 --> 17:24.029
She's spent lots of time
in bed, resting.

17:24.435 --> 17:30.602
We took her to the doctor but
he couldn't find anything wrong.

17:30.943 --> 17:33.571
We're very concerned about her.

17:33.979 --> 17:40.646
I thought the program was pushing
the children too much...

17:40.919 --> 17:42.648
Too many experiments.

17:42.788 --> 17:49.159
I wonder if she's exhausted
her powers on that one occasion...

17:52.498 --> 17:56.400
"Unused footage of a TV variety show
taped on October 23"

17:56.735 --> 18:00.330
Hello, we're the Ungirls.

18:00.506 --> 18:05.170
We're so popular that
ants crawl up our legs in the park.

18:05.677 --> 18:07.770
When I'm a pall-bearer

18:07.913 --> 18:12.475
I'm so tall that
I have to hold the coffin myself.

18:12.651 --> 18:14.084
We're the Ungirls.

18:14.219 --> 18:19.816
We're on our way to a shrine,
a popular ghost-sighting spot.

18:19.958 --> 18:24.019
It was deemed boring if
it was just the two of us.

18:24.163 --> 18:26.495
So we have the actress
Marika Matsumoto here too.

18:26.665 --> 18:30.260
Good evening. I'm Marika Matsumoto.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.836
I heard that you have a sixth sense.

18:32.971 --> 18:34.336
That's right.

18:34.673 --> 18:37.767
Have you ever had any
supernatural experiences?

18:37.910 --> 18:40.708
Yes. Ever since I was a child...

18:40.846 --> 18:42.074
For so long?

18:42.247 --> 18:43.942
Yes. I've seen apparitions.

18:44.850 --> 18:46.215
Are you okay, Marika?

18:46.818 --> 18:51.016
I don't know...
The back of my neck's tingling.

18:51.557 --> 18:53.855
You feel tingly?

18:54.493 --> 18:55.721
I'm scared...

18:55.861 --> 18:57.886
Maybe we shouldn't go in there?

18:58.163 --> 19:01.826
But that's what we are here for,
so we're going in.

19:04.136 --> 19:05.865
Here we are!

19:07.539 --> 19:08.665
You want to go in?

19:10.776 --> 19:12.368
It's spooky...

19:13.645 --> 19:18.378
Guys! I feel something over
in that direction.

19:19.785 --> 19:22.310
I feel something really strange...

19:22.854 --> 19:24.048
This way.

19:24.456 --> 19:25.821
We'd better stay here.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.755
Let's all go in together.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.986
It feels very strange...

19:33.498 --> 19:34.760
But there's nothing here.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.960
Maybe it's here... Yes, it is.

19:38.103 --> 19:40.697
Can you bring the camera over here?

19:41.773 --> 19:44.640
Only these trees are dead.

19:45.244 --> 19:47.644
Everywhere else the trees are okay.

19:47.913 --> 19:49.574
They're okay there, too.

19:49.848 --> 19:52.510
Only here, they're dead.

19:53.051 --> 19:55.884
Look at this tree. So lumpy.

19:56.288 --> 20:00.281
Yuck...
It's dripping with something sticky.

20:01.126 --> 20:04.095
What's this?
Is it oozing from the tree?

20:04.296 --> 20:05.729
No! Don't touch it!

20:06.498 --> 20:10.935
I mean it. Stay back...

20:11.403 --> 20:12.734
Is it bad?

20:16.141 --> 20:17.438
Shit!

20:18.644 --> 20:19.941
What's wrong?

20:23.882 --> 20:25.611
I heard something...

20:25.751 --> 20:26.979
Did you hear that?

20:27.119 --> 20:28.518
Did I? I heard nothing...

20:28.687 --> 20:33.624
Something... lt was a low voice,
like a man's.

20:33.759 --> 20:35.056
A man's voice?

20:35.193 --> 20:37.388
Was that you?

20:38.697 --> 20:41.791
I've had enough of this.

20:46.738 --> 20:51.334
There's nothing over there.

21:08.327 --> 21:11.057
Stop the camera! Stop it!

21:21.106 --> 21:24.803
"November 26, a live talk show,
A Night of True Horror Stories."

21:31.049 --> 21:33.711
Wasn't that something special?

21:33.885 --> 21:37.480
It was incredible. I was blown away.

21:37.756 --> 21:40.054
How do you feel now, Marika?

21:40.592 --> 21:43.220
I feel embarrassed.

21:44.196 --> 21:47.654
So this footage was edited out?

21:47.833 --> 21:54.534
That's right. The director arranged
for me to have a copy.

21:54.673 --> 22:00.873
In the footage, you said you could
hear a man's voice.

22:01.213 --> 22:04.239
It was a very low voice.

22:06.351 --> 22:10.014
It sounded like it was calling me.

22:10.188 --> 22:14.386
Did you see me turn
when I heard the voice?

22:15.694 --> 22:19.425
I remember nothing
from that point on.

22:19.564 --> 22:21.498
Nothing at all?

22:21.633 --> 22:23.260
No.

22:23.635 --> 22:29.870
Tonight, we have a special guest
who'll examine Marika's condition.

22:30.008 --> 22:32.442
A person with psychic ability.

22:32.577 --> 22:35.842
Let's welcome our guest!

22:47.559 --> 22:49.356
Let's hear it for him!

23:02.073 --> 23:04.371
Calm down, he's our guest.

23:04.543 --> 23:10.072
Our guest has arrived in
an outfit that's very different.

23:10.348 --> 23:14.512
Can you see us up on the stage?
Come this way.

23:14.653 --> 23:19.090
We want you to use your power and
give us your impression of Marika.

23:19.224 --> 23:25.163
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Mitsuo Hori.

23:25.297 --> 23:29.666
A man with unique psychic powers.

23:29.801 --> 23:32.361
He's engaged in activities

23:32.504 --> 23:37.407
to protect humans against
ectoplasmic worms.

23:38.009 --> 23:41.672
Look at the flier you were given
at the door.

23:41.813 --> 23:44.043
It's difficult to
follow his thoughts...

23:44.649 --> 23:47.846
Hey, let her go.

23:47.986 --> 23:49.510
You are in big trouble!

23:49.654 --> 23:51.645
Pigeons!

23:51.990 --> 23:55.084
My, God! The pigeons!

23:55.927 --> 23:58.088
The pigeons!

24:00.065 --> 24:01.965
Show him the door.

24:03.068 --> 24:05.764
Watch out for the pigeons!

24:08.940 --> 24:12.842
"Midoriyama TV Studio"

24:17.315 --> 24:22.275
"Kobayashi met the director
of the variety show."

24:22.621 --> 24:23.747
Are you Mr. Kobayashi?

24:24.022 --> 24:27.753
- I'm Kobayashi.
- I'm Shimbashi.

24:28.026 --> 24:33.259
When I gave the footage to Marika,
I edited something out.

24:33.665 --> 24:35.690
I didn't want to spook her.

24:47.212 --> 24:51.012
This is right before
she screams and collapses.

24:51.283 --> 24:55.379
There's something I want you to see.

25:01.293 --> 25:03.523
"Sugishobou Publishing"

25:03.662 --> 25:06.722
Hello.

25:06.865 --> 25:09.026
This is Miyajima, our cameraman.

25:09.167 --> 25:11.328
Nice to meet you.

25:11.469 --> 25:14.495
I'm Marika Matsumoto.
It's my pleasure.

25:15.907 --> 25:21.368
It's on the right side of you
on the video.

25:23.548 --> 25:27.575
You can see it just briefly.
I'll pause the image for you.

25:29.854 --> 25:31.515
Right after this.

25:33.391 --> 25:34.881
It's here.

25:39.564 --> 25:40.895
Oh, God...

25:43.268 --> 25:45.634
I don't know if it's related...

25:45.770 --> 25:48.136
What is it, Ms. Matsumoto?

25:48.273 --> 25:50.798
Something's been bothering me lately

25:53.511 --> 25:55.035
Take a look at this.

25:58.717 --> 26:01.743
The drawing?

26:02.420 --> 26:04.445
I don't know what it is.

26:04.589 --> 26:09.049
But I find myself drawing
these images unconsciously.

26:09.294 --> 26:13.128
When did you start drawing
these patterns?

26:13.298 --> 26:14.424
I guess...

26:15.433 --> 26:18.664
After the video shoot at the shrine.

26:18.803 --> 26:20.566
The shrine...

26:25.110 --> 26:26.702
Wait!

26:28.313 --> 26:32.477
There are so many... I can feel it!

26:32.951 --> 26:35.784
Wait, wait...

26:36.554 --> 26:37.987
Can you see something?

26:38.123 --> 26:40.148
No, I can't see anything but...

26:40.692 --> 26:42.523
There are so many of them!

26:44.029 --> 26:46.361
I don't know what they are...

26:48.400 --> 26:51.267
I've had enough of this.

26:54.339 --> 26:56.273
Do you see something?

27:11.156 --> 27:15.183
"December 4"

27:18.129 --> 27:23.328
The slight fever she had
stopped some time ago...

27:23.868 --> 27:28.464
But instead, she's beginning to
act strangely recently...

27:29.574 --> 27:31.599
It's strange.

27:32.510 --> 27:40.440
She's often talking to somebody
when there's nobody in the room.

27:40.585 --> 27:44.919
Who is it that you talk to...

27:45.457 --> 27:50.861
that your mother isn't able to see?

27:54.599 --> 27:58.501
I guess it's too late for all of us.

28:02.107 --> 28:03.938
What do you mean?

28:08.847 --> 28:12.214
We'd better take it, too.

28:26.998 --> 28:28.465
No!

28:29.200 --> 28:30.599
What's wrong?

28:30.802 --> 28:34.898
Kana...

28:35.807 --> 28:37.775
Kana, you'd better lie down.

28:40.478 --> 28:44.073
Excuse me...

29:09.574 --> 29:13.408
"Footage from a variety show
aired on December 9"

29:13.845 --> 29:17.872
Now, Maria Takagi went to
interview a psychic!

29:18.283 --> 29:20.183
Let's watch the interview.

29:20.585 --> 29:23.986
This psychic man
was really something.

29:24.122 --> 29:26.090
- You saw him?
- I did.

29:26.224 --> 29:28.124
- It's on video?
- Yes!

29:28.259 --> 29:31.353
Okay, let's not watch it.

29:31.496 --> 29:35.193
No? It's like... duh!

29:35.333 --> 29:36.925
What kind of reaction is that?

29:37.068 --> 29:40.299
Here's the interview with
The Super Psychic!

29:41.272 --> 29:43.069
This is Maria Takagi.

29:43.474 --> 29:49.606
Today, I'm here to meet with the
super psychic who lives around here.

29:52.784 --> 29:56.584
I can't wait to find his place.

29:56.921 --> 30:02.018
Is it true that your next door
neighbor is a super psychic?

30:02.627 --> 30:04.151
Super psychic?

30:05.230 --> 30:07.391
I think he's a freaking psycho.

30:07.799 --> 30:13.237
I saw him several times
putting out the garbage...

30:14.572 --> 30:15.539
He's a freaking psycho.

30:15.673 --> 30:17.038
He can't be cured.

30:18.877 --> 30:21.402
So he's a freaking psycho.

30:26.317 --> 30:27.784
Is this it?

30:34.525 --> 30:38.621
"Strange messages on the garbage"

30:40.465 --> 30:44.629
Hello! Is the super psychic home?

30:52.443 --> 30:55.606
Are you the super psychic?

31:04.522 --> 31:08.788
Mitsuo Hori...

31:11.696 --> 31:12.958
I can do that.

31:15.199 --> 31:16.860
I'm psychic.

31:18.202 --> 31:23.162
Could I interview you?

31:32.383 --> 31:35.352
Is it alright?

31:37.188 --> 31:39.520
I'm coming inside.

31:41.893 --> 31:45.920
Can you see this?
We've got to show this!

31:48.266 --> 31:51.724
The room's covered entirely
with aluminum foil!

31:51.903 --> 31:55.737
Hundreds of fliers are
stored in these boxes.

31:57.275 --> 32:03.145
What's written on these fliers?
I mean...

32:03.281 --> 32:05.579
What are they for?

32:06.050 --> 32:12.011
For years, I've been receiving
dangerous information...

32:12.156 --> 32:14.249
Dangerous messages...

32:15.026 --> 32:16.687
Space...

32:17.795 --> 32:18.955
What?

32:20.031 --> 32:22.192
- Space!
- Space!

32:22.734 --> 32:24.395
With space...

32:26.904 --> 32:28.895
I can connect...

32:32.610 --> 32:34.339
I can see the future...

32:34.946 --> 32:37.608
Many bad, bad guys...

32:40.752 --> 32:42.686
Ectoplasmic worms...

32:43.721 --> 32:47.748
It says so here.
"Ectoplasmic worms."

32:48.593 --> 32:53.496
The worms are all over,
crawling, squirming...

33:03.608 --> 33:08.568
The super psychic's expressing
himself with body language.

33:09.814 --> 33:12.408
Is that his expression for
the ectoplasmic worms?

33:15.753 --> 33:18.085
"December 22"

33:29.467 --> 33:35.804
Was anything out of the ordinary
around the time that Kana vanished?

33:36.140 --> 33:40.543
For about a week
before she disappeared...

33:40.845 --> 33:48.945
there was a man
who kept visiting her.

33:49.153 --> 33:54.318
I had no idea
what he was talking about.

33:59.230 --> 34:05.829
He was wearing a hat covered with
aluminum foil.

34:06.304 --> 34:08.534
And also...

34:08.672 --> 34:14.407
he had a long coat covered with
aluminum foil.

34:15.545 --> 34:19.380
And for some reason, Kana told me...

34:19.516 --> 34:25.717
that the man was
of no threat to her...

34:27.058 --> 34:28.855
On the day that Kana disappeared...

34:29.159 --> 34:36.225
We found this strange flier.
It was placed face down.

34:37.568 --> 34:42.437
It says, "Help."
I think this is Kana's handwriting.

34:43.774 --> 34:46.139
See what Kana drew on this?

34:46.277 --> 34:50.373
Has she always drawn
this kind of pattern?

34:50.581 --> 34:55.041
"Kana's parents said they'd never
seen anything like this before."

34:55.186 --> 34:57.051
"Help."

35:13.704 --> 35:16.537
"The worms are increasing.
If we don't deal with them..."

35:19.277 --> 35:22.474
Hello, is Mr. Hori home?

35:26.083 --> 35:27.448
Excuse me.

35:35.459 --> 35:39.452
I'm a journalist
doing some research.

35:39.730 --> 35:43.996
Can you help me with my research
into the missing girl, Kana?

35:45.436 --> 35:46.698
Who are you?

35:47.371 --> 35:49.965
My name is Kobayashi.

35:50.408 --> 35:53.707
I believe we met on the talkshow
the other night.

36:00.685 --> 36:01.845
What?

36:02.186 --> 36:03.414
Come in!

36:09.527 --> 36:11.051
Oh, excuse me.

36:16.067 --> 36:20.970
What's with
the aluminum on the walls?

36:21.138 --> 36:23.732
Why are you covered with it?

36:25.876 --> 36:30.404
It protects me from the tingling.

36:30.581 --> 36:36.611
Because the ectoplasmic worms
are near...

36:37.955 --> 36:41.152
What are these ectoplasmic worms?

36:45.763 --> 36:48.994
These horrible worms...

36:50.901 --> 36:53.301
they are everywhere.

36:54.272 --> 36:57.935
They eat people and they multiply.

36:58.276 --> 36:59.937
Eat people?

37:01.779 --> 37:04.213
Kana...

37:05.549 --> 37:07.813
She was eaten, too.

37:09.153 --> 37:10.950
Kana?

37:12.356 --> 37:14.085
Mr. Hori.

37:15.059 --> 37:20.156
You know something about her,
don't you?

37:26.337 --> 37:28.271
Where is Kana now?

37:31.242 --> 37:35.008
I lost track of where she is...

37:39.984 --> 37:43.511
Mr. Hori! Let go of my bag!

37:43.988 --> 37:46.957
Stop it at once!

37:49.527 --> 37:51.688
Kana!

37:52.296 --> 37:54.856
This flier...

37:56.167 --> 37:58.897
I picked it up at her house.

37:59.670 --> 38:02.434
What do you know about
her disappearance?

38:02.973 --> 38:04.338
Quiet!

38:19.256 --> 38:20.723
Blue...

38:21.826 --> 38:24.158
A blue building...

38:25.229 --> 38:26.787
A blue building...

38:26.931 --> 38:28.262
Blue?

38:29.834 --> 38:33.531
Galvanized iron sheets...

38:35.005 --> 38:36.267
What is it?

38:36.407 --> 38:37.931
Cars...

38:39.410 --> 38:40.934
A parking lot?

38:44.081 --> 38:45.810
Is he drawing a map?

38:46.884 --> 38:51.048
The worms are coming out...

38:51.188 --> 38:53.122
The worms?

38:53.457 --> 38:55.357
The worms are coming out.

38:56.694 --> 39:01.791
A young man...

39:05.002 --> 39:06.731
A young man.

39:06.937 --> 39:12.034
The worms took Kana away.

39:12.376 --> 39:15.675
They took her away!

39:35.499 --> 39:36.966
To that direction?

39:38.969 --> 39:41.494
Wait a second, Mr. Hori.

39:41.772 --> 39:43.569
I have a map for you.

39:43.707 --> 39:46.505
This is where we are.

39:46.644 --> 39:49.238
That way!

39:52.283 --> 39:54.308
I can't read the map...

39:55.119 --> 39:57.144
Did he say that way?

40:03.828 --> 40:06.422
What's Kagutaba?

40:07.198 --> 40:10.258
Kagu... What did you say?

40:16.640 --> 40:18.369
Calm down, Mr. Hori!

40:20.578 --> 40:22.808
Are you okay?

40:29.153 --> 40:31.678
Calm down!

40:32.590 --> 40:34.114
Go away!

40:46.670 --> 40:48.001
Excuse us!

40:52.743 --> 40:56.907
Something weird happened
to the video image...

40:57.882 --> 40:59.406
What do you mean, "weird"?

41:38.489 --> 41:40.582
"Kobayashi looked for Kana according
to the map of Mitsuo Hori."

41:40.724 --> 41:43.591
Mr. Kobayashi, how about that
apartment over there?

41:44.628 --> 41:46.323
There is a parking lot.

41:48.799 --> 41:51.324
But they're in different positions.

41:51.902 --> 41:53.893
That's a blue building.

41:54.972 --> 41:57.770
But it has only two stories.

41:58.375 --> 41:59.637
This isn't it.

42:09.987 --> 42:11.420
This is difficult.

42:12.556 --> 42:14.649
Hello, this is Marika Matsumoto.

42:15.059 --> 42:18.961
I have something I want to show you.

42:19.129 --> 42:20.153
What is it?

42:23.300 --> 42:25.393
"December 26, Meguro, Tokyo"

42:25.536 --> 42:29.973
I wanted to show you these loops.

42:30.674 --> 42:36.135
When I woke up yesterday morning,
I found the yarn.

42:36.947 --> 42:41.509
And the wool was tied into
these complicated knots.

42:41.652 --> 42:44.382
With many loops.

42:44.555 --> 42:50.255
I don't recall putting the yarn here
before I went to bed.

42:50.728 --> 42:54.824
I don't remember tying the wool
in knots, either.

42:55.132 --> 42:59.967
Something must have happened
while I was asleep.

43:00.504 --> 43:04.406
I'm scared to fall asleep now...

43:04.608 --> 43:07.338
I'll leave the camera plugged in.

43:07.478 --> 43:10.106
Turn it on when you go to bed.

43:10.881 --> 43:12.178
Okay.

43:21.992 --> 43:25.587
"Later that night"

44:45.943 --> 44:48.741
And you never woke up until morning?

44:49.379 --> 44:50.744
No.

44:53.784 --> 44:57.845
And you remember nothing after
you fell asleep initially?

44:58.889 --> 45:00.686
No, I don't.

45:13.837 --> 45:18.433
These loops look just like
the ones on the wool.

45:19.042 --> 45:20.475
They do...

45:20.611 --> 45:24.206
Very similar...
The way they are tied...

45:39.797 --> 45:46.100
Maybe this is the same banging
noise recorded on the video.

45:48.338 --> 45:50.169
It may be.

45:51.875 --> 45:56.175
A girl who works for the same agency
lives upstairs.

45:56.380 --> 45:57.870
Is that right?

45:58.348 --> 46:00.816
How long has it been like this?

46:01.351 --> 46:03.148
Lately...

46:03.287 --> 46:05.118
Uh-huh.

46:07.291 --> 46:08.815
Sorry to bother you.

46:08.959 --> 46:10.984
What's up?

46:14.031 --> 46:15.828
Is this for TV?

46:15.966 --> 46:22.565
Have you been banging on the floor?

46:23.373 --> 46:26.399
What? No, I haven't.

46:26.543 --> 46:28.408
Did you hear a banging sound?

46:29.179 --> 46:32.740
I've been here all day,
but I didn't hear anything.

46:32.883 --> 46:34.350
- Didn't you?
- No.

46:34.618 --> 46:37.985
I heard banging...

46:38.255 --> 46:44.285
late last night, too.

46:44.761 --> 46:48.720
Really? I didn't hear that either.

46:48.899 --> 46:50.230
Are you sure?

46:50.567 --> 46:55.004
Have you noticed anything
out of the ordinary recently?

46:56.340 --> 47:01.368
Have you felt inexplicably sick?

47:01.578 --> 47:03.170
Anything like that?

47:04.581 --> 47:08.244
No, nothing strange has been
happening in my life.

47:08.652 --> 47:11.280
Sorry. Did we scare you?

47:11.421 --> 47:12.854
No, it's okay.

47:17.227 --> 47:21.129
"January 6, 2004, Nakano, Tokyo"

47:21.865 --> 47:24.834
I didn't know
what this was before...

47:24.968 --> 47:27.266
But I think this is a telephone pole

47:27.404 --> 47:31.397
3 stories. Even the number of
windows matches.

47:31.541 --> 47:34.567
It's a bluish-colored building, too.

47:34.778 --> 47:36.439
And the room indicated is...

47:36.580 --> 47:40.676
2nd from the right on
the 3rd floor.

47:40.851 --> 47:44.753
The one with garbage bags
on the veranda.

47:45.422 --> 47:47.549
Let's go to the room.

47:59.503 --> 48:01.164
A person named Osawa lives here.

48:07.010 --> 48:10.741
Hello, is Mr. Osawa in?

48:22.092 --> 48:23.491
I can hear something inside.

48:31.468 --> 48:33.197
Excuse me.

48:33.403 --> 48:38.500
Do you know anything about Mr. Osawa
who lives next door?

48:39.109 --> 48:42.601
He's a man of about 25.

48:42.746 --> 48:47.342
I barely see him.
He's often talking to himself.

48:47.484 --> 48:52.046
He was also making the banging
sound a while ago.

48:52.189 --> 48:55.420
Did you hear that noise?

48:55.559 --> 49:01.555
Have you ever seen the man
with a girl of...

49:01.698 --> 49:06.658
about 10 years of age?

49:07.137 --> 49:10.334
No, I've never seen him
with a girl.

49:13.477 --> 49:17.641
"January 7"

49:23.620 --> 49:27.351
The pigeons are only on
Osawa's veranda.

49:28.492 --> 49:30.084
It's strange.

49:30.460 --> 49:33.020
Keep the camera on the room.

49:33.163 --> 49:34.323
Definitely.

50:06.897 --> 50:09.024
There he is.

50:27.484 --> 50:31.284
"A few days later, Osawa vanished."

50:40.497 --> 50:47.926
There's a strange sound on the
tape of Marika in her room.

50:48.071 --> 50:49.663
I'll play it back.

51:00.217 --> 51:01.241
Around here.

51:15.265 --> 51:17.256
Did you hear that?

51:21.171 --> 51:25.801
"We had the tape analyzed."

51:28.044 --> 51:31.810
The original sound's here.
On the right it's processed.

51:32.115 --> 51:33.707
You can compare them.

51:39.356 --> 51:41.881
The noise is reduced
on this recording.

51:51.568 --> 51:53.229
What's Kagutaba?

52:21.798 --> 52:22.924
What do you think?

52:24.668 --> 52:28.399
It actually sounds like...

52:28.605 --> 52:35.636
the voice I heard at
the shrine that night.

52:36.046 --> 52:40.574
You mean the shrine
you visited for the TV show?

52:40.750 --> 52:42.274
Yes.

52:42.619 --> 52:45.087
It sounds just like that voice.

52:45.922 --> 52:50.552
The voice on the tape seems
to be saying, Kagutaba.

52:50.694 --> 52:53.857
Kagutaba?

52:55.031 --> 53:00.264
Does the word Kagutaba
mean anything to you?

53:02.405 --> 53:06.637
No, I don't think so.

53:07.110 --> 53:08.805
I've never heard of it.

53:18.321 --> 53:20.789
"Kobayashi started to look into
the word Kagutaba."

53:20.991 --> 53:23.323
It's this word, Kagutaba.

53:23.460 --> 53:24.950
Yes, Kagutaba.

53:25.362 --> 53:31.062
It's far fetched, but you could
speculate that it derives from

53:31.201 --> 53:33.931
Kamitama, meaning god's spirit.

53:34.070 --> 53:35.799
I see. God's spirit...

53:35.939 --> 53:40.205
Have you ever heard a foreign word

53:40.343 --> 53:42.675
that sounds like Kagutaba?

53:42.812 --> 53:45.406
I can't think of any.

53:45.548 --> 53:47.778
Is this Doctor Shioya?

53:47.984 --> 53:51.317
I'm trying to find out about
a strange word.

53:51.621 --> 53:53.953
The word is Kagutaba.

53:54.424 --> 53:55.391
Kagutaba?

53:55.525 --> 53:57.720
Yes, that's right.

53:57.861 --> 54:00.295
Kagutaba...

54:02.265 --> 54:07.396
I think I saw it in some book
or something.

54:12.075 --> 54:13.667
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

54:15.845 --> 54:18.712
Let's get down to business.

54:18.848 --> 54:22.875
The book you mentioned on the phone.

54:23.186 --> 54:24.551
Can I take a look at it?

54:25.155 --> 54:30.559
This is an ethnological document
compiled by the Tokita county office

54:31.328 --> 54:36.425
I found the word Kagutaba
mentioned in this book.

54:36.700 --> 54:41.137
There's a town called Shikamimachi
in Tokita county.

54:41.271 --> 54:44.001
Right next to the town

54:44.140 --> 54:48.008
there used to be a village called
Shimokage village.

54:48.211 --> 54:51.009
It's now at the bottom of a dam.

54:51.581 --> 54:57.645
Before the village's demise
the villagers had a strange custom.

54:57.787 --> 55:00.950
It was called the demon ritual.

55:01.091 --> 55:02.820
Demon ritual?

55:03.059 --> 55:06.426
It was performed
to pacify the demon.

55:06.563 --> 55:10.829
And according to the book...

55:11.368 --> 55:15.600
The demon was called Kagutaba.

55:16.740 --> 55:22.406
Does that mean that Kagutaba
is the name of a demon?

55:23.179 --> 55:28.947
Well, it's difficult to say.
I think that it was just...

55:29.085 --> 55:34.853
convenient for them to call
the unknown entity a demon.

55:35.859 --> 55:41.229
This is a document that is over
200 years old.

55:42.098 --> 55:44.430
It says Kagutaba right here.

55:44.601 --> 55:48.867
The kanji characters for
"disaster, tool and spirit."

55:49.205 --> 55:52.299
The 3 characters make up
the word Kagutaba.

55:52.675 --> 55:57.544
A tool that's capable of causing
disasters.

55:57.680 --> 55:59.443
That's what it means.

55:59.849 --> 56:04.343
A long time ago,
in Shimokage village...

56:04.487 --> 56:09.220
there was a group of sorcerers
who migrated from the west.

56:09.492 --> 56:14.987
They developed a type of sorcery
called "Shimokage's Way."

56:15.131 --> 56:22.833
One of their spells was called
the "Kagutaba method."

56:23.239 --> 56:27.733
The sorcerer performed the spell
to summon Kagutaba...

56:27.877 --> 56:32.712
which was sent to an adversary
to put him under a deadly spell.

56:32.849 --> 56:37.684
The document says that
that was the role of Kagutaba.

56:37.854 --> 56:41.551
But in one incident,
when a sorcerer summoned Kagutaba...

56:41.791 --> 56:45.454
it disobeyed the instructions of
the sorcerer.

56:46.029 --> 56:49.829
It started to do evil things
on its own.

56:50.099 --> 56:53.591
So the sorcerer...
performed another spell

56:53.937 --> 56:59.398
and finally succeeded in
confining Kagutaba deep underground.

57:03.146 --> 57:07.344
"Shimokage Village submerged with the
construction of Shikami Dam in 1978"

57:07.484 --> 57:09.452
"The demon ritual was discontinued."

57:11.488 --> 57:13.388
This is Shikami town hall.

57:13.656 --> 57:17.717
I'm interested in the old rituals
performed

57:17.861 --> 57:20.694
at Shimokage village before it went
underwater.

57:21.998 --> 57:23.898
Okay... Hold on please.

57:26.069 --> 57:28.936
So you want to know
about the Shimokage rituals?

57:29.072 --> 57:30.300
Yes, I do.

57:30.773 --> 57:33.742
We don't have it
very well documented so...

57:33.977 --> 57:36.673
I'll introduce you to someone.

57:36.913 --> 57:40.815
Mr. Tanimura
researches local history.

57:41.050 --> 57:43.382
Hello, my name's Kobayashi.

57:44.988 --> 57:46.512
Oh, hello there.

57:47.290 --> 57:48.882
Please come in.

57:49.425 --> 57:53.293
The ritual was never
performed publicly.

57:53.429 --> 57:55.522
So there's no documentation.

57:56.065 --> 58:00.764
But the last ritual
performed in 1978 was filmed

58:00.937 --> 58:06.705
by a film production contracted by
Mr. Ishii, the priest.

58:07.243 --> 58:09.473
These are the 16mm films.

58:10.747 --> 58:13.545
I pleaded with the Ishii family to
give them to me.

58:13.816 --> 58:21.154
This is the video.
I transferred the film to video.

58:31.701 --> 58:37.537
Shimokage village was a community
of sorcerers.

58:37.840 --> 58:40.741
The villagers
still believe in sorcery.

58:43.012 --> 58:46.675
Now it's becoming a fading memory

58:46.983 --> 58:54.014
but they still place a sickle at
the door to keep away evil spirits.

58:54.157 --> 59:00.255
Those who left the village have
a sickle above their front doors.

59:00.663 --> 59:02.096
Interesting.

59:02.231 --> 59:03.562
"We don't need a dam!"

59:07.370 --> 59:11.033
Shimokage sorcerers used dogs
in their rituals.

59:11.307 --> 59:16.574
That's why the villagers
still have dogs.

59:19.816 --> 59:23.479
This is the Demon Shrine where
the ritual was performed.

59:25.121 --> 59:29.057
Mr. Ishii was a priest
at this shrine.

59:29.392 --> 59:31.587
You'll see him in a minute.

59:35.198 --> 59:39.066
Look. That's Kagutaba.

59:42.405 --> 59:46.239
This ritual is to pacify the demon.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.363
Now Kagutaba is rampaging.

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:34.883
That's Ishii, the priest.

01:00:35.558 --> 01:00:39.756
He is going to pacify Kagutaba.

01:00:46.936 --> 01:00:49.837
Now the priest will bow...

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:59.241
One bow, four claps... and one bow.

01:00:59.949 --> 01:01:04.613
This is a distinctive way to bow,
only done at this shrine.

01:01:06.022 --> 01:01:12.484
Usually it's two bows,
two claps and one bow.

01:01:13.963 --> 01:01:17.592
But this is one bow,
four claps, one bow.

01:01:17.734 --> 01:01:23.400
There is no other place in Japan
where people bow in this manner.

01:01:23.673 --> 01:01:27.769
But after the priest bowed...

01:01:27.944 --> 01:01:34.713
The woman who was playing the part
of Kagutaba became delirious.

01:01:34.951 --> 01:01:37.112
They had to stop the ritual.

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:31.829
The religious villagers said that
she was possessed.

01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:36.540
Some said that
owing to the dam plan...

01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:41.706
the ritual wouldn't be performed
again, which angered Kagutaba.

01:02:41.951 --> 01:02:44.283
They thought it was
some kind of curse.

01:02:45.087 --> 01:02:51.424
In the legend, Kagutaba was confined
underneath Shimokage village.

01:02:51.727 --> 01:02:55.493
And it's the demon in the ritual.

01:02:55.898 --> 01:02:58.628
What was it really?

01:02:59.168 --> 01:03:02.797
Nobody knows for sure.

01:03:04.106 --> 01:03:09.203
I would like to meet
Mr. Ishii, the priest.

01:03:09.712 --> 01:03:11.202
Is that possible?

01:03:11.747 --> 01:03:18.516
7 years ago, immediately after
giving me the film...

01:03:18.754 --> 01:03:21.018
Mr. Ishii died from an illness.

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:25.627
So did his wife but
their only daughter's still alive.

01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:31.198
She was the possessed woman
in the film...

01:03:31.334 --> 01:03:34.497
She recently moved back here
from Tokyo.

01:03:34.637 --> 01:03:38.733
I heard that she lives with
her son in the Ishii house.

01:03:39.275 --> 01:03:42.267
She's in the Mikaishi community,

01:03:42.411 --> 01:03:44.504
where the Shimokage villagers
moved to.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:46.147
Mikaishi?

01:03:46.616 --> 01:03:50.177
I also heard that
she's a bit eccentric.

01:03:51.053 --> 01:03:54.386
I don't know if she'll talk to you.

01:04:05.401 --> 01:04:07.266
"Mikaishi Village"

01:04:07.403 --> 01:04:09.496
I think we're almost there.

01:04:31.827 --> 01:04:33.226
What's this?

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.553
This has to have some connection.

01:05:11.033 --> 01:05:12.432
Hello?

01:05:16.105 --> 01:05:17.572
Hello?

01:05:21.243 --> 01:05:23.143
Anybody home?

01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:28.943
How can you talk to me like that!?

01:05:29.318 --> 01:05:32.845
I'm asking you!
How can you talk to me like that?

01:05:43.566 --> 01:05:45.397
Did you see her?

01:05:46.002 --> 01:05:47.594
I did.

01:05:48.938 --> 01:05:55.104
A woman in her 40s and her boy,
aged between 6 and 9.

01:05:55.578 --> 01:05:58.741
How can you just
talk to me like that?

01:05:58.948 --> 01:06:02.111
So her name is Junko Ishii.

01:06:06.122 --> 01:06:10.650
Kobayashi asked around.

01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:16.130
Look, the sickle.

01:06:17.233 --> 01:06:19.633
Hello, anybody home?

01:06:30.813 --> 01:06:33.646
Is anybody home?

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:35.217
Nobody.

01:06:39.188 --> 01:06:40.655
May I help you?

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:45.984
Excuse me but do you know
the Ishii house down the street?

01:06:46.695 --> 01:06:49.425
There seems to be
something strange...

01:06:49.698 --> 01:06:54.362
Yeah, ever since
the daughter came back.

01:06:54.770 --> 01:06:56.931
You'd best stay away from her.

01:06:58.941 --> 01:07:00.238
For you own sake.

01:07:07.483 --> 01:07:08.677
Excuse me.

01:07:10.986 --> 01:07:12.112
What?

01:07:12.288 --> 01:07:13.380
Sorry to bother you.

01:07:13.522 --> 01:07:14.614
TV?

01:07:14.957 --> 01:07:19.053
You know Mrs. Ishii down the street.

01:07:19.361 --> 01:07:20.760
Ishii?

01:07:35.177 --> 01:07:40.809
I'm a journalist doing research.
You may be able to help me.

01:07:40.950 --> 01:07:41.712
Could you help me?

01:07:41.851 --> 01:07:43.375
Come in.

01:07:43.786 --> 01:07:45.754
Oh, thank you so much.

01:07:46.856 --> 01:07:52.556
I was a good friend of Junko's
before she moved out.

01:07:52.862 --> 01:07:57.390
She left the village to go
to nursing school in Tokyo.

01:07:57.533 --> 01:08:01.469
Do you remember
the name of the school?

01:08:01.604 --> 01:08:09.306
Musashino Nurse School or something.
I don't remember clearly.

01:08:09.445 --> 01:08:14.542
How can I put this...
Has Junko always been...

01:08:14.683 --> 01:08:17.618
mentally disturbed like she is now?

01:08:17.752 --> 01:08:19.345
Not at all.

01:08:19.522 --> 01:08:22.389
She was just a friendly,
regular girl.

01:08:22.524 --> 01:08:23.321
Was she?

01:08:23.459 --> 01:08:26.951
She changed after the demon ritual.

01:08:27.095 --> 01:08:28.426
The demon ritual?

01:08:29.031 --> 01:08:31.295
She started to act strangely.

01:08:32.868 --> 01:08:37.567
I think the ritual caused her
to become possessed.

01:08:40.042 --> 01:08:45.810
She told me that she'd heard
god's voice.

01:08:46.415 --> 01:08:49.212
She said she had to obey his words.

01:08:50.486 --> 01:08:54.819
She became kind of strange
after that.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:09:00.957
I heard that people thought
it was the Kagutaba's curse.

01:09:01.697 --> 01:09:03.323
Do you think she was...

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:23.180
Excuse me?

01:09:28.157 --> 01:09:29.317
Hello?

01:09:35.831 --> 01:09:38.060
"January 21, Musashino, Tokyo"

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:44.662
May I ask a few questions about
Junko Ishii, one of your graduates?

01:09:44.807 --> 01:09:49.107
After she graduated in 1982

01:09:49.245 --> 01:09:53.978
she got a job at an obstetric clinic
in Hachioji.

01:09:54.116 --> 01:09:56.243
I can disclose the name of
the clinic

01:09:56.418 --> 01:10:00.286
but it closed in 2000.

01:10:03.626 --> 01:10:07.528
May I ask you some questions

01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:10.460
regarding somebody
you used to work with?

01:10:10.599 --> 01:10:12.089
Sure.

01:10:12.668 --> 01:10:16.195
Junko Ishii.
What kind of a person was she?

01:10:16.939 --> 01:10:21.899
She was a very hardworking woman.

01:10:22.111 --> 01:10:25.103
Quiet in a spooky sort of way.

01:10:25.381 --> 01:10:30.409
She was the kind of woman
who only talks about work.

01:10:31.253 --> 01:10:34.484
The clinic we used to work for...

01:10:34.623 --> 01:10:39.993
performed abortions even into
the 22nd week of pregnancies.

01:10:41.263 --> 01:10:43.788
It's clearly illegal.

01:10:44.033 --> 01:10:50.268
And she was the one in charge of
disposing of the aborted embryos.

01:10:50.406 --> 01:10:54.809
There was a rumor that
she took the embryos home.

01:10:57.146 --> 01:10:59.671
"Did she really take the embryos?"

01:10:59.815 --> 01:11:02.113
"If she did, for what purpose?"

01:11:05.354 --> 01:11:08.448
"February 6"

01:11:11.293 --> 01:11:16.595
Midori? Is she your colleague...

01:11:16.732 --> 01:11:19.200
the one who lives directly upstairs?

01:11:22.838 --> 01:11:24.635
Yes. Midori has...

01:11:33.482 --> 01:11:35.279
She's dead.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:44.655
The police came and told me that...

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:58.902
Midori... committed suicide.

01:12:00.809 --> 01:12:03.175
She did it in the park.

01:12:05.214 --> 01:12:09.048
She killed herself with...

01:12:10.386 --> 01:12:13.617
a bunch of strangers.

01:12:16.592 --> 01:12:18.617
They hanged themselves...

01:12:22.097 --> 01:12:25.260
Do you think it was my fault?

01:12:30.172 --> 01:12:34.632
I got so scared that
I left the apartment.

01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:43.147
I'm sorry...

01:12:43.986 --> 01:12:45.954
I'm sorry...

01:12:49.792 --> 01:12:54.320
Kobayashi asked his wife to
take care of Marika.

01:13:01.069 --> 01:13:02.832
I'm home.

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.471
Hi.

01:13:06.809 --> 01:13:07.639
Keiko, my wife.

01:13:07.776 --> 01:13:09.073
Nice to meet you.

01:13:09.611 --> 01:13:13.012
It's nice of you to let me stay.

01:13:15.684 --> 01:13:19.518
"News footage aired the same night"

01:13:19.688 --> 01:13:24.455
6 am today in Hironuma Park
in Nerima, Tokyo...

01:13:24.693 --> 01:13:29.562
7 men and women were found dead.

01:13:29.698 --> 01:13:32.599
They were hanging
from the iron bar of the swing.

01:13:33.602 --> 01:13:39.336
It's suspected that the strangers
got together to commit suicide.

01:13:42.678 --> 01:13:46.774
"7 bodies hanging from the swing."

01:13:53.088 --> 01:13:58.617
Here are the names of those
who hanged themselves.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.853
"February 10"

01:14:01.763 --> 01:14:03.094
Look.

01:14:04.766 --> 01:14:09.226
This is the girl who lived
upstairs from Marika.

01:14:15.043 --> 01:14:16.943
And look at him.

01:14:27.789 --> 01:14:32.385
When he first moved in
he was just a pleasant, normal guy.

01:14:32.728 --> 01:14:36.630
But about half a year ago...
It was around last summer...

01:14:36.798 --> 01:14:42.327
He started to complain a lot to
the woman who was living next door.

01:14:42.604 --> 01:14:44.162
They argued a lot.

01:14:44.306 --> 01:14:45.364
Is that right?

01:14:45.507 --> 01:14:50.467
His neighbor was a tough
middle-aged woman.

01:14:51.246 --> 01:14:56.548
But eventually she moved out.
I guess she felt scared.

01:14:56.818 --> 01:14:59.309
The neighbor moved out?

01:14:59.454 --> 01:15:08.158
Do you remember what kind of
arguments they used to have?

01:15:11.133 --> 01:15:14.500
He complained about the baby
being too noisy.

01:15:14.636 --> 01:15:15.830
A baby?

01:15:15.971 --> 01:15:18.064
She didn't have a baby, though.

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:24.506
It was just her and her boy
who was 5 or 6.

01:15:25.614 --> 01:15:27.878
Just a moment, please...

01:15:29.718 --> 01:15:34.746
Is the woman
who used to live there...

01:15:36.124 --> 01:15:38.888
Is this the woman?

01:15:39.227 --> 01:15:41.320
Yes, that's her.

01:15:41.997 --> 01:15:43.897
No mistake. It's her.

01:15:50.005 --> 01:15:52.838
"News footage, February 12"

01:15:54.076 --> 01:15:55.407
Next news.

01:15:55.744 --> 01:15:58.372
Earlier today at an apartment
in Fuchu

01:15:58.614 --> 01:16:03.278
a businessman stabbed his wife
to death and got arrested.

01:16:03.685 --> 01:16:06.415
Our reporter is at the murder site.

01:16:07.389 --> 01:16:09.289
Today at 7:10 am

01:16:09.524 --> 01:16:14.723
a man called the police
and said that he'd stabbed his wife.

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:17.225
The police rushed
to the apartment

01:16:17.399 --> 01:16:21.631
and found Kimiko Yano
stabbed to death.

01:16:22.204 --> 01:16:27.141
Also at the site was the suspect,
Teruyuki Yano, her husband.

01:16:27.275 --> 01:16:30.574
He confessed and was arrested
on the spot.

01:16:30.812 --> 01:16:36.478
So far he has not told the police
why he killed his wife.

01:16:36.885 --> 01:16:41.948
Their daughter has been missing
for a few months.

01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:45.355
Do the police know anything
about her disappearance?

01:16:46.328 --> 01:16:48.922
They have no information on her.

01:16:49.164 --> 01:16:54.227
Kana, the daughter disappeared
on December 19 last year.

01:16:54.503 --> 01:16:56.232
No clues have been found.

01:16:59.641 --> 01:17:05.375
Today, Marika's cooking for me.

01:17:05.514 --> 01:17:06.913
It's something yummy.

01:17:08.150 --> 01:17:12.052
It's Spaghetti al Bongole
with tomato sauce.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:17.553
Here, my special pasta
and potato salad.

01:17:18.527 --> 01:17:19.858
They look great.

01:17:20.028 --> 01:17:24.328
And this is... my special tea.

01:17:24.466 --> 01:17:26.331
Isn't it out of a can?

01:17:26.468 --> 01:17:28.993
No. It's my special oolong tea.

01:17:31.039 --> 01:17:33.200
Would you like some Tabasco?

01:17:33.608 --> 01:17:35.508
Yes? Here it comes.

01:17:37.312 --> 01:17:40.941
A gourmet lunch.

01:17:45.987 --> 01:17:47.352
Marika?

01:17:53.862 --> 01:17:55.454
Marika!

01:18:02.704 --> 01:18:05.673
Marika, what's wrong?

01:18:09.444 --> 01:18:10.911
Did I groan?

01:18:11.046 --> 01:18:12.411
Yes.

01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:20.952
You seemed to be suffering,
you groaned and...

01:18:23.859 --> 01:18:31.095
And some things crashed into
the window at the same time.

01:18:50.852 --> 01:18:52.319
What is it?

01:18:52.487 --> 01:18:54.751
Are you okay?

01:19:31.526 --> 01:19:33.551
I'm...

01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:37.060
I'm the next one to die.

01:19:47.676 --> 01:19:50.907
I'm going to Nagano again.

01:19:51.613 --> 01:19:54.081
I'll talk to Junko Ishii...

01:19:54.683 --> 01:20:00.485
and get her to talk to us.

01:20:02.891 --> 01:20:08.796
That will help us
solve this mystery.

01:20:14.269 --> 01:20:21.107
Hori, the psychic said
to watch out for pigeons.

01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:29.746
Did he mean that pigeons were
a sign of imminent death?

01:20:37.225 --> 01:20:44.529
Let's visit him tomorrow
and ask him about it.

01:20:53.675 --> 01:20:55.233
"We visited Mr. Hori"

01:20:55.377 --> 01:20:57.902
"to show him the Junko Ishii tape."

01:21:00.115 --> 01:21:04.051
"February 13"

01:21:10.525 --> 01:21:11.719
Mr. Hori.

01:21:13.061 --> 01:21:15.996
Are you ready, Mr. Hori?

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.563
This is what we want you to watch.

01:21:23.238 --> 01:21:24.967
It's on this tape.

01:21:48.697 --> 01:21:50.164
I'm sorry.

01:21:51.499 --> 01:21:53.091
I've turned it off.

01:21:59.341 --> 01:22:02.310
Mr. Hori.

01:22:03.178 --> 01:22:07.080
When you watched the video,
did you feel something

01:22:07.248 --> 01:22:09.239
or did you see anything?

01:22:11.486 --> 01:22:13.579
Mr. Hori.

01:22:23.365 --> 01:22:24.764
Mr. Kobayashi.

01:22:28.103 --> 01:22:30.401
Take me to the dam...

01:22:31.106 --> 01:22:34.837
where the village was,
the one with the demon rituals.

01:22:37.012 --> 01:22:39.412
Why do you want to go there?

01:22:39.547 --> 01:22:44.484
I want to try to perform
the ritual myself...

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.782
and see what it does to me.

01:22:47.956 --> 01:22:49.617
Absolutely not!

01:22:49.758 --> 01:22:56.220
The ritual might have caused
Junko Ishii's possession.

01:22:56.698 --> 01:22:58.996
It's too dangerous.

01:22:59.901 --> 01:23:04.235
If the ritual is necessary,
I'll go and do it by myself.

01:23:04.472 --> 01:23:06.599
I don't want to die...

01:23:10.078 --> 01:23:12.603
I have to do it myself.

01:23:26.027 --> 01:23:27.551
Please.

01:23:33.001 --> 01:23:38.769
Okay then. Let's go to the dam.

01:23:39.174 --> 01:23:41.836
I'll visit Mr. Hori again

01:23:42.177 --> 01:23:44.111
and ask him to come along with us.

01:23:46.448 --> 01:23:49.144
Mr. Hori! We need your help!

01:23:49.451 --> 01:23:52.113
What can we do to contain
the Kagutaba curse?

01:23:54.255 --> 01:23:55.552
Mr. Hori.

01:23:58.593 --> 01:24:02.051
We can't do this without your help.

01:24:04.632 --> 01:24:07.226
Kana...

01:24:07.869 --> 01:24:10.269
The worms have eaten her...

01:24:10.472 --> 01:24:14.408
Maybe these worms are
actually Kagutaba.

01:24:34.095 --> 01:24:36.928
It's too quiet around here...

01:24:43.872 --> 01:24:47.205
Where are the dogs now?

01:24:52.347 --> 01:24:56.249
"We drove to the dam
where Shimokage village used to be."

01:25:31.753 --> 01:25:34.654
"Shikami Dam"

01:25:37.058 --> 01:25:38.025
Are you okay?

01:25:53.942 --> 01:25:58.379
This is where we are on the map.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.680
So the shrine must have been...

01:26:02.517 --> 01:26:08.251
right between that point
and the shore.

01:26:15.663 --> 01:26:16.994
Off we go.

01:26:17.799 --> 01:26:20.199
Let me know when you get back.

01:26:20.735 --> 01:26:22.430
Thank you so much.

01:26:24.973 --> 01:26:28.272
We'll be back soon.

01:26:35.917 --> 01:26:37.578
Are you okay, Marika?

01:26:39.153 --> 01:26:42.816
You don't look good.
We should go back.

01:26:42.991 --> 01:26:45.459
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

01:26:47.795 --> 01:26:49.228
We're almost there.

01:27:03.511 --> 01:27:04.671
It's about here.

01:27:05.947 --> 01:27:08.780
Let's get ready.

01:27:46.487 --> 01:27:47.784
Good.

01:27:49.057 --> 01:27:54.324
Now, you bow in that special way.

01:27:55.663 --> 01:28:02.398
One bow, four claps, one bow...

01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:43.304
How do you feel?

01:28:56.224 --> 01:28:57.452
Talk to me.

01:29:02.363 --> 01:29:04.024
I'm better.

01:29:04.732 --> 01:29:05.699
Are you?

01:29:06.167 --> 01:29:08.158
I feel lighter.

01:29:08.503 --> 01:29:13.964
Good! It worked for you.

01:29:14.375 --> 01:29:17.139
It was good we came to do this!

01:29:17.278 --> 01:29:19.109
It's gone...

01:29:23.151 --> 01:29:28.248
What's wrong, Mr. Hori?

01:29:28.423 --> 01:29:29.913
It's not good...

01:29:30.057 --> 01:29:31.251
What's not good?

01:29:31.726 --> 01:29:33.751
It's not good at all...

01:29:34.095 --> 01:29:37.030
I feel so much clearer now.

01:29:37.665 --> 01:29:39.599
Thank you so much.

01:29:48.409 --> 01:29:49.740
Hurry back!

01:29:51.078 --> 01:29:53.376
Oh, no, no, no!

01:29:53.714 --> 01:29:55.045
Hurry!

01:29:55.349 --> 01:29:59.547
Get out of there!

01:29:59.921 --> 01:30:02.014
They'll eat you up!

01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:04.023
Now!

01:30:04.158 --> 01:30:05.523
Hurry!

01:30:06.627 --> 01:30:09.994
We have to leave the mountain!

01:30:10.331 --> 01:30:11.491
Drive away!

01:30:11.632 --> 01:30:14.066
Let's get out of here, then.

01:30:14.202 --> 01:30:16.170
Back to the car.

01:30:18.005 --> 01:30:19.165
Mr. Hori.

01:30:21.309 --> 01:30:22.435
Kana!

01:30:26.747 --> 01:30:28.715
Wait a minute, Mr. Hori!

01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:30.579
Take care of Marika.

01:30:30.852 --> 01:30:31.841
No problem.

01:30:36.357 --> 01:30:38.348
Mr. Kobayashi, wait!

01:30:38.626 --> 01:30:41.151
Don't worry, I'll be right back.

01:30:41.762 --> 01:30:43.593
He's okay. Let's go.

01:30:43.764 --> 01:30:44.731
Are you sure?

01:30:45.066 --> 01:30:46.158
To the car.

01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:50.730
Wait a minute!

01:31:01.082 --> 01:31:04.813
Are they going to be okay?

01:31:05.019 --> 01:31:06.486
I'll go look for them later.

01:31:07.221 --> 01:31:08.882
How do you feel now?

01:31:09.323 --> 01:31:13.123
Me? I'm feeling just fine.

01:31:13.794 --> 01:31:14.886
Let's go then.

01:31:18.399 --> 01:31:19.423
Mr. Hori!

01:31:20.735 --> 01:31:21.997
Kana!

01:31:25.673 --> 01:31:27.834
Mr. Hori, you have to stop!

01:31:28.442 --> 01:31:30.000
Kana!

01:31:45.393 --> 01:31:49.659
Wait a minute!

01:32:13.154 --> 01:32:13.916
Marika?

01:32:18.826 --> 01:32:21.795
Wait for me, Mr. Hori!

01:32:23.064 --> 01:32:24.224
What is it?

01:32:25.967 --> 01:32:28.367
What's wrong?

01:32:30.504 --> 01:32:31.937
Dogs?

01:32:35.176 --> 01:32:37.007
They've just been killed...

01:32:37.244 --> 01:32:38.768
Are they the village dogs?

01:32:42.683 --> 01:32:46.346
What's happening now?

01:32:48.923 --> 01:32:51.858
What's this?

01:32:55.663 --> 01:33:00.532
It's a magic field...

01:33:05.006 --> 01:33:09.466
What's going on here?

01:33:15.516 --> 01:33:18.417
More dead dogs...

01:33:18.686 --> 01:33:22.850
Don't go in there!

01:33:23.524 --> 01:33:26.550
Stay away!

01:33:28.095 --> 01:33:29.221
Marika!

01:33:31.666 --> 01:33:34.191
Are you okay, Marika?

01:33:37.738 --> 01:33:39.706
Marika, what's wrong?

01:33:43.244 --> 01:33:45.644
Should I pull over? Are you okay?

01:33:58.259 --> 01:34:00.284
What's wrong? Are you okay?

01:34:11.038 --> 01:34:12.198
Marika!

01:34:17.278 --> 01:34:18.711
Marika!

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:30.016
What's going on, Mr. Hori?

01:34:30.424 --> 01:34:32.824
What did you find there?

01:34:37.298 --> 01:34:38.390
Marika!

01:34:40.835 --> 01:34:42.029
Marika!

01:34:49.844 --> 01:34:55.749
Marika, can you hear me?

01:34:57.451 --> 01:34:59.942
Can you hear me?

01:35:00.087 --> 01:35:04.615
Marika!

01:35:20.374 --> 01:35:22.103
It's a shrine!

01:35:22.810 --> 01:35:26.769
Kana... Kana...

01:35:27.515 --> 01:35:28.777
Mr. Hori!

01:35:44.698 --> 01:35:48.657
Mr. Hori, is Kana in there?

01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:50.464
Marika.

01:35:59.013 --> 01:35:59.980
Marika!

01:36:07.721 --> 01:36:11.452
Marika!

01:36:14.495 --> 01:36:16.429
Marika!

01:36:18.499 --> 01:36:19.932
Kana.

01:36:20.267 --> 01:36:23.236
Is she in there?

01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:31.178
This is ancient.

01:36:33.514 --> 01:36:34.606
My God!

01:36:35.115 --> 01:36:38.414
This pattern is the same as
what Kana drew...

01:36:41.622 --> 01:36:42.919
What's wrong, Mr. Hori?

01:37:12.286 --> 01:37:16.120
Mr. Hori, are you okay?

01:37:16.924 --> 01:37:18.391
Mr. Hori!

01:37:21.262 --> 01:37:23.787
Get a grip of yourself!

01:37:24.064 --> 01:37:25.497
Marika!

01:37:27.401 --> 01:37:32.100
Come back!

01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:40.212
Can you hear me?

01:37:41.415 --> 01:37:42.643
Yes...

01:37:45.486 --> 01:37:46.851
Are you okay?

01:37:47.488 --> 01:37:49.217
Yes...

01:37:50.124 --> 01:37:52.217
What is this?

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:03.564
"We took Marika and Mr. Hori
to a local hospital."

01:38:06.473 --> 01:38:11.308
"And we went back to Junko Ishii's
house in search of truth."

01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:17.510
Excuse me!

01:38:56.523 --> 01:38:57.717
Let's go in.

01:39:13.407 --> 01:39:14.999
Let's go and see.

01:39:51.545 --> 01:39:54.173
Film here.

01:40:02.956 --> 01:40:04.048
Let's go upstairs.

01:40:51.338 --> 01:40:52.862
It's Junko Ishii.

01:40:54.575 --> 01:40:58.602
It's her. She's hung herself.

01:41:02.516 --> 01:41:04.040
Look at that!

01:41:05.586 --> 01:41:07.417
Kagutaba masks.

01:41:12.526 --> 01:41:15.120
She's hung pigeons up here...

01:41:21.268 --> 01:41:23.998
There is a boy behind there!

01:41:24.138 --> 01:41:25.799
A boy?

01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:28.373
Behind there!

01:41:32.913 --> 01:41:34.244
Kana!

01:41:35.015 --> 01:41:37.882
It's Kana! It's her!

01:41:40.587 --> 01:41:44.250
Kana!

01:41:50.731 --> 01:41:52.699
She's cold...

01:41:54.568 --> 01:41:56.297
Are you okay?

01:41:56.770 --> 01:41:58.795
Are you hurt?

01:42:06.613 --> 01:42:07.875
Miyajima.

01:42:09.349 --> 01:42:12.284
We have to call the police now.

01:42:49.323 --> 01:42:53.259
"Missing girl found dead
in Nagano."

01:42:54.528 --> 01:42:56.860
"The boy presumed to be Ishii's son"

01:42:56.997 --> 01:42:59.864
"isn't actually her child."

01:43:00.567 --> 01:43:04.059
Kobayashi decided to adopt the boy.

01:43:07.541 --> 01:43:11.375
"March 6"

01:43:13.914 --> 01:43:15.142
Is it good?

01:43:19.052 --> 01:43:20.644
Yummy?

01:43:22.422 --> 01:43:24.652
It's a good omelet, isn't it?

01:43:32.899 --> 01:43:37.768
Do you remember anything about
living with that woman?

01:43:59.259 --> 01:44:03.093
Marika, you look very good now.

01:44:03.697 --> 01:44:09.465
Yes. I've been recovering nicely.

01:44:10.771 --> 01:44:13.797
All those supernatural things...

01:44:14.074 --> 01:44:18.101
have stopped happening.

01:44:18.278 --> 01:44:20.109
Everything's normal now.

01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:21.677
Have you gone back to work?

01:44:22.215 --> 01:44:27.847
Yes. I'm going back to work soon.

01:44:28.922 --> 01:44:30.583
You have to eat it.

01:44:30.724 --> 01:44:32.589
Okay, let's eat everybody.

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:35.094
Let's eat.

01:44:35.896 --> 01:44:36.794
Yummy.

01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.792
Are you sure?

01:44:37.931 --> 01:44:39.330
Don't hit me! Ouch...

01:44:48.008 --> 01:44:51.637
"March 13"

01:44:54.514 --> 01:44:57.847
"Hori has been committed
to an institution."

01:44:58.352 --> 01:45:01.685
"No visitors are allowed."

01:45:05.058 --> 01:45:06.650
"March 17"

01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:11.092
I looked around for other things
connected to Kagutaba

01:45:11.732 --> 01:45:14.030
after you left.

01:45:14.301 --> 01:45:19.762
And I found this in
my grandfather's collection.

01:45:20.574 --> 01:45:21.905
Here.

01:45:31.952 --> 01:45:35.888
It says, "Shimokage's Way,
The Kagutaba method."

01:45:36.022 --> 01:45:37.284
Oh, that's right.

01:45:38.191 --> 01:45:40.182
I guess this scroll depicts

01:45:40.394 --> 01:45:44.854
the ritual performed
to summon Kagutaba.

01:45:45.198 --> 01:45:48.361
These are the monkeys.

01:45:48.769 --> 01:45:52.136
And the dogs.

01:45:53.073 --> 01:45:57.100
They sacrificed the baby monkeys

01:46:01.515 --> 01:46:05.474
and offered them
to the medium to eat.

01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:17.219
Just like the ancient spell of
the Shimokage sorcery...

01:46:17.697 --> 01:46:22.157
which used baby monkeys
as sacrifices.

01:46:22.402 --> 01:46:27.533
Junko Ishii used
Kana Yano as a medium.

01:46:28.508 --> 01:46:32.308
She fed Kana the aborted babies...

01:46:32.712 --> 01:46:38.173
in an attempt to resurrect Kagutaba.

01:46:39.019 --> 01:46:44.616
It's only my speculation.

01:46:45.425 --> 01:46:49.452
Now that Junko Ishii's dead

01:46:50.163 --> 01:46:53.257
we'll never know the truth.

01:46:54.801 --> 01:47:01.604
I only hope that the Kagutaba curse
has been contained.

01:47:02.175 --> 01:47:05.838
I guess it's too late
for all of us.

01:47:22.696 --> 01:47:25.995
"Camera operator, Hisashi Miyajima"

01:47:27.601 --> 01:47:32.061
"Produced by Masafumi Kobayashi"

01:47:40.447 --> 01:47:43.473
2 days after "NOROI, The Curse"
was completed...

01:47:54.995 --> 01:47:57.657
The Kobayashi house burned down.

01:47:59.566 --> 01:48:03.866
Later his wife, Keiko was found dead
in the remains.

01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:09.803
But Kobayashi wasn't found.
He was declared missing.

01:48:13.146 --> 01:48:14.977
3 days after the fire...

01:48:15.448 --> 01:48:20.408
Mitsuo Hori, who had escaped from
the institution

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:22.620
was found dead.

01:48:22.756 --> 01:48:24.724
"Picture of the Dead Man."

01:48:25.892 --> 01:48:28.383
"Mystery of the man
who died in the duct!"

01:48:36.770 --> 01:48:42.731
May 19, 2004, a month later

01:48:43.710 --> 01:48:47.612
a package was delivered to
Sugishobou Publishing.

01:48:48.248 --> 01:48:50.512
There was no return address.

01:48:51.484 --> 01:48:55.648
The sender's name was
Masafumi Kobayashi.

01:48:58.758 --> 01:49:02.023
There was a video camera inside.

01:49:04.864 --> 01:49:06.889
And inside the camera...

01:49:08.268 --> 01:49:10.736
a video cassette was intact.

01:49:30.790 --> 01:49:32.815
What's going on, Mr. Hori?

01:49:34.227 --> 01:49:35.990
Are you okay?

01:49:38.865 --> 01:49:39.832
Mr. Hori?

01:49:40.066 --> 01:49:42.466
You...

01:49:43.703 --> 01:49:47.469
You've been eaten...

01:49:47.774 --> 01:49:50.265
by the worms!

01:49:50.744 --> 01:49:52.302
Are you?

01:49:52.445 --> 01:49:54.037
Excuse me?

01:49:54.381 --> 01:49:58.613
Why don't you put that rock down?

01:50:00.286 --> 01:50:05.417
I can hear Kana...
Her voice comes in my head...

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.156
- In my head... lt says...
- What is it?

01:50:13.133 --> 01:50:14.896
Kagutaba's alive...

01:50:15.568 --> 01:50:16.865
It lives!

01:50:17.003 --> 01:50:18.664
What did you say?

01:50:19.773 --> 01:50:22.241
Kagutaba lives!

01:50:22.375 --> 01:50:25.833
But Junko Ishii's dead now.

01:50:26.012 --> 01:50:28.480
Kagutaba has gone now.

01:50:28.782 --> 01:50:31.945
You'd better go back
to the institution.

01:50:32.085 --> 01:50:33.916
You should go back.

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.844
Should I call the police?

01:50:36.022 --> 01:50:38.217
No... Stop!

01:50:40.326 --> 01:50:41.554
What are you doing?

01:50:45.131 --> 01:50:47.429
Stop! What you're doing!

01:50:52.739 --> 01:50:55.708
Stop it!

01:50:56.543 --> 01:50:58.238
There he is!

01:50:59.112 --> 01:51:00.943
What do you want?

01:51:09.022 --> 01:51:11.547
It's him!

01:51:12.258 --> 01:51:13.782
He killed Kana...

01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:15.552
Wait, just a minute.

01:51:15.762 --> 01:51:17.593
The boy's a victim, too.

01:51:19.632 --> 01:51:22.294
Kana!

01:51:22.469 --> 01:51:24.664
Hold on a second!

01:51:24.971 --> 01:51:28.566
Calm down.

01:51:29.909 --> 01:51:31.604
You have to listen to me.

01:51:33.279 --> 01:51:35.110
Just wait a minute.

01:51:37.217 --> 01:51:41.381
I'll help you with
whatever you need.

01:51:42.856 --> 01:51:48.419
Let go off the boy, okay?

01:51:48.561 --> 01:51:50.188
No!

01:51:51.364 --> 01:51:56.267
Stop it!

01:52:02.375 --> 01:52:05.037
Are you okay?

01:52:13.987 --> 01:52:16.512
Kana!

01:52:24.564 --> 01:52:27.658
Keiko!

01:52:30.136 --> 01:52:31.967
Mr. Hori!

01:52:40.346 --> 01:52:43.747
Hori?

01:52:47.353 --> 01:52:49.947
Mr. Hori...

01:53:23.289 --> 01:53:24.620
Keiko?

01:53:31.364 --> 01:53:32.456
Keiko!

01:53:59.525 --> 01:54:00.958
Keiko!

01:54:04.797 --> 01:54:08.255
Keiko!

01:54:13.506 --> 01:54:17.636
Keiko!

01:54:20.213 --> 01:54:27.210
Keiko!

01:54:31.157 --> 01:54:36.720
"Masafumi Kobayashi is
still missing today."
