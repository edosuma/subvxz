00:02.293 --> 00:04.212
- 16 OF THE BEST TATTOO ARTISTS
IN THE COUNTRY

00:04.295 --> 00:08.132
ARE BATTLING IT OUT TO DETERMINE
WHO'S NUMBER ONE.

00:08.216 --> 00:09.342
- [groans]

00:09.426 --> 00:11.761
- ON THE LAST EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>

00:11.845 --> 00:14.013
AMERICA VOTED, AND FAN FAVORITE
FROM SEASON TWO,

00:14.097 --> 00:17.434
TATU BABY, RETURNED
TO PROVE HERSELF

00:17.517 --> 00:20.311
AGAINST THE NEW CROP
OF ARTISTS.

00:20.395 --> 00:21.896
- I'M DEFINITELY READY
TO KICK ASS.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.483
- AND THE FIRST FLASH
CHALLENGE WAS BEHIND BARS.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.484
- YOU IN MY HOUSE.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.445
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep]
WHERE I'M AT, MAN.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.113
I'M NOT AN EASY GUY
TO BACK DOWN.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.823
I'M NOT A BITCH.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.616
- IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

00:33.700 --> 00:36.453
THE ARTISTS HAD
TO COVER PRISON TATTOOS.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.121
- DON'T JUST SIT THERE
AND TAKE IT UP THE [bleep].

00:38.204 --> 00:39.289
THERE'S NO CRYING
IN TATTOOING,

00:39.372 --> 00:40.707
AND EVERYBODY SHOULD BE FIGHTING
TO THE DEATH.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.375
- JOSHUA CAME HERE
WITH A GAME PLAN.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.252
HE'S AN INSTIGATOR.
- ARE YOU HERE TO LEARN,

00:44.335 --> 00:46.629
OR ARE YOU HERE TO BE
THE [bleep] INK MASTER?

00:46.713 --> 00:49.716
- AND THE BIGGEST TWIST
OF THE SEASON WAS REVEALED--

00:49.799 --> 00:52.469
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY.
- WHAT?

00:52.552 --> 00:54.637
- MY [bleep] IS SCREAMING
ON FIRE.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.472
SHE HURT ME, BRO.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.515
- IF YOU DON'T PLEASE
YOUR CANVAS,

00:57.599 --> 00:58.933
YOU COULD GO HOME.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.477
- AT THE ELIMINATION,

01:00.560 --> 01:02.437
MYSTICAL MIKE, MADDIE,
AND FRANK

01:02.520 --> 01:03.605
WERE THE BOTTOM THREE.

01:03.688 --> 01:04.480
- FRANK.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.524
- YOU DIDN'T GET
ANY OF THE TEXTURES.

01:06.608 --> 01:10.069
THERE'S NOT ONE CLEAN BIT
OF OUTLINE.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.070
- MADDIE.
- THE TOWERS ARE WAY OFF.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.741
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CASTLE'S
TAKING A LEFT.

01:14.824 --> 01:15.825
- I DID IT ON PURPOSE.
- NO, IT'S JACKED, IT'S--

01:15.909 --> 01:18.578
IT'S NOT RIGHT.
- MIKE.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.830
- MY PROBLEM WITH THIS TATTOO
IS IT LACKS ANY TIGHT DETAILS.

01:20.914 --> 01:21.873
- I DON'T KNOW
IF ANYONE NOTICED,

01:21.956 --> 01:22.957
I ONLY HAD ONE MACHINE
TO WORK WITH

01:23.041 --> 01:24.125
FOR THE WHOLE TATTOO.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.293
- YOU HAVE ONE TATTOO MACHINE?

01:25.376 --> 01:26.503
- I DON'T EVER LEAVE MY HOUSE

01:26.586 --> 01:28.338
WITHOUT EIGHT MACHINES,
MINIMUM.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.590
- THAT'S INSANE.

01:30.673 --> 01:34.761
- FRANK, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.516
- 15 ARTISTS REMAIN,

01:39.599 --> 01:43.019
BUT ONLY ONE WILL EARN
A $100,000 PRIZE

01:43.102 --> 01:45.355
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

AND I THINK
I HAVE MORE CREATIVITY

03:08.354 --> 03:09.606
THAN MY TECHNICAL SKILL
WILL ALLOW ME TO PRODUCE.

THE MOST CREATIVE ARTIST HERE?

BUT MY TECHNICAL SKILL LIMITS ME

03:15.987 --> 03:18.781
TO MY PRODUCTION VALUE.
- WHAT?

03:18.865 --> 03:20.950
- SAY THAT AGAIN.
- SAY IT SLOWER TOO.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.660
- I'D RATHER BE KNOWN
AS PRODUCING VALUABLE ART

03:22.744 --> 03:23.578
THAN TO BE
AN ENTERTAINING SPECTACLE.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.413
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND YOU.

03:25.496 --> 03:28.124
{\an8}MYSTICAL MIKE TRIES TO IMPRESS
PEOPLE WITH WHAT HE'S SAYING

03:28.207 --> 03:31.252

RIGHT THERE.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.075

04:02.158 --> 04:04.953
WE BEGIN
WITH THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.956
THIS WEEK, WE'RE TESTING A SKILL
THAT CAN TAKE YOUR TATTOO

04:08.039 --> 04:11.960
FROM BEING AVERAGE
TO BEING A MASTERPIECE--

04:12.043 --> 04:14.170
PRECISION.

04:14.253 --> 04:17.423
{\an8}- PRECISION IS BEING ABLE
TO NAIL THAT MARK,

04:17.507 --> 04:19.676
{\an8}DRAW A PERFECT LINE,
PUT THAT PERFECT DETAIL IN

04:19.759 --> 04:23.054
{\an8}WITH A REALLY HIGH LEVEL
OF HAND-EYE COORDINATION.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.807
- TODAY WE HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.184
A FORMER OFFENSIVE PLAYER

04:28.267 --> 04:29.686
AND THREE-TIME
PRO BOWLER,

04:29.769 --> 04:32.355
TENNESSEE TITANS

{\an8}- I GOT MY FIRST TATTOO
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE.

04:44.575 --> 04:47.912
AFTER I GOT MY 20TH TATTOO,
I LOST COUNT.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.498
- NOW THERE'S A REASON WE ASKED
CHRIS TO JOIN US TODAY.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.625
I HEAR YOU GOT A REALLY
BEAUTIFUL, CUSTOMIZED CAR.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.169
- I'M VERY MUCH INTO CARS.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.295
COMING UP AND NOT BEING ABLE
TO HAVE ANYTHING,

04:56.379 --> 04:59.257
I ALWAYS WANTED TO DO THAT
ONCE I GOT OLDER

04:59.340 --> 05:01.551
AND COULD AFFORD TO DO IT.
- RIGHT ON, MAN.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.512
FROM PAINT JOBS AND RIMS
TO BUMPERS AND HEADLIGHTS,

05:04.595 --> 05:06.222
GRILLES ARE ONE
OF THE ACCESSORIES

05:06.305 --> 05:07.890
CAR ENTHUSIASTS CUSTOMIZE,

05:07.974 --> 05:09.475
TURNING THEIR VEHICLES
INTO WORKS OF ART.

05:09.559 --> 05:13.396
FOR TODAY'S FLASH CHALLENGE,
YOU WILL HAVE THREE HOURS

05:13.479 --> 05:17.442
TO CREATE
A CUSTOMIZED GRILLE.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.360
- WHAT?

05:19.444 --> 05:22.405
{\an8}I JUST HAVE A BIG, BLACK CLOUD
IN MY HEAD

05:22.488 --> 05:24.532
{\an8}WITH A QUESTION MARK.

05:24.615 --> 05:25.783
{\an8}- THERE'S JUST ONE CATCH--

05:25.867 --> 05:30.747
{\an8}YOU MUST WORK
IN TEAMS OF THREE.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.665
{\an8}- I DO NOT LIKE WORKING
IN TEAMS

05:32.749 --> 05:33.750
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M THE ALPHA DOG
USUALLY.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.586
- TATU BABY, YOU WON
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY

05:36.669 --> 05:38.421
IN THE LAST
ELIMINATION TATTOO.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.298
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN THE TEAMS

05:40.381 --> 05:42.258
FOR THIS FLASH CHALLENGE.

05:42.341 --> 05:44.802
SIGN THE SKULLS.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.597
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE [bleep],
DESIGNING A GRILLE, WHAT IT IS.

05:47.680 --> 05:48.765
{\an8}I KNOW THIS IS
A MAN'S CHALLENGE,

05:48.848 --> 05:52.185
{\an8}AND YOU'RE DAMN WELL SURE
THAT I'M GONNA PICK SOMEBODY

05:52.268 --> 05:54.520
{\an8}THAT I THINK KNOWS WHAT THE HELL
THEY'RE DOING.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.355
- PLEASE NO MYSTICAL MIKE.

05:56.439 --> 05:57.482
{\an8}BABY'S DEFINITELY GONNA TAKE
CARE OF HERSELF,

05:57.565 --> 06:00.109
{\an8}AND THE REST OF US ARE GONNA BE
KIND OF A CRAPSHOOT.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.613
- ONE BY ONE, READ THE NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL,

06:03.696 --> 06:06.657
REVEALING YOUR TEAM,
AS WELL AS THE CAR

06:06.741 --> 06:07.950
YOU'VE RANDOMLY BEEN
ASSIGNED.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.327
TATU BABY, YOU'RE UP FIRST,

06:09.410 --> 06:14.540
AND YOUR TEAM IS ASSIGNED
CAR NUMBER ONE.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.877

06:17.960 --> 06:20.046
- TEAM NUMBER ONE, LOCKED.

06:20.129 --> 06:22.340
KYLE, YOU'RE UP NEXT,

06:22.423 --> 06:23.591
AND YOUR TEAM IS ASSIGNED
CAR NUMBER TWO.

06:23.674 --> 06:28.805
- CRAIG.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.056
- MYSTICAL MIKE.

06:30.139 --> 06:33.142
- YES. [laughs]

06:33.226 --> 06:35.436
{\an8}- I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT
TO WORK WITH MYSTICAL MIKE.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.314
{\an8}HE'S JUST TOO FAR OUT THERE.
I'M SCREWED HERE.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.899
- JOEY, YOU'RE UP NEXT,
AND YOUR TEAM IS ASSIGNED

06:39.982 --> 06:42.193

06:42.276 --> 06:45.154

06:52.995 --> 06:56.165
- TEAM NUMBER FOUR.
AND FINALLY, JASON,

06:56.249 --> 06:58.501
YOUR TEAM IS ASSIGNED
CAR NUMBER FIVE.

06:58.584 --> 07:02.255
- JOSHUA.
- ALLY.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.841
- THE WINNERS OF THE FLASH
CHALLENGE WILL HAVE THE POWER

07:04.924 --> 07:07.176
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES

07:07.260 --> 07:09.470
IN THE ELIMINATION TATTOO
TOGETHER.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.639
YOU HAVE THREE HOURS,

07:11.722 --> 07:16.018
AND YOUR TIME STARTS...
NOW.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.271
- WHAT YOU GUYS THINKING,
DESIGN-WISE?

07:18.354 --> 07:20.106
{\an8}- TODAY I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
WHO CAN PULL OFF PRECISION

07:20.189 --> 07:22.733
{\an8}WITH CLEAN LINES,
ARTISTIC ABILITY,

07:22.817 --> 07:24.986
{\an8}AND TO BE VERSATILE.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.529
{\an8}- PRECISION IS MY WORK.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.781
{\an8}I AM THE WEAKER LINK
IN THIS GROUP.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.616
{\an8}I HAVE TO LET THE BOYS GUIDE ME.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.578
{\an8}- WE WANT TO DO A V8 LOGO
HERE IN THE CENTER.

07:33.661 --> 07:35.663
{\an8}- THAT WOULD BE DOPE.
- AND THEN WE CAN DO SOME WINGS.

07:35.746 --> 07:38.291
{\an8}OUR TEAM IS VERY STRONG, AND
I KNOW WE GOT THIS IN THE BAG.

07:38.374 --> 07:41.502
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.
- THANKS, JIME.

07:41.586 --> 07:43.045
- OH, YOU SEE
THOSE GUYS IN THERE?

07:43.129 --> 07:45.506
THEY'RE GONNA SHOOT THEMSELVES
IN THE ASS.

07:45.590 --> 07:47.967
- WHAT IF WE DID
NEGATIVE-SPACE SPIDER WEBS?

07:48.050 --> 07:49.719
- I THINK A SPIDER
WOULD BE DOPE.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.846
- IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE A [bleep]
SUPERHERO CAR, DUDE.

07:51.929 --> 07:57.059
{\an8}- WINNING THE POWER TO ASSIGN
THE CANVASES IS A HUGE THING.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.103
WE COULD DO TWO MORE SPIDER WEBS
COMING THIS WAY.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.438
- THAT MIGHT BE OVERKILL.

08:00.521 --> 08:03.816
- I'M LOOKED AT AS THE BOTTOM
RIGHT NOW.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.068
WINNING THIS WOULD MEAN A LOT
FOR ME.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.987
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK THAT LOOKS GREAT.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.405
- I LIKE IT, BUT TIME, MAN.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.866
- WE NEED YOU TO DRAW
THE FRONT OF THE CAR.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.951
I'M TOTALLY GONNA BE
THE LEADER OF THIS TEAM.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.078
{\an8}THIS IS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.

08:16.162 --> 08:19.624
{\an8}WHAT IF WE DID A FOOTBALL HELMET
HERE AND A FOOTBALL HERE?

08:19.707 --> 08:20.875
{\an8}- WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

08:20.958 --> 08:22.919
{\an8}IT'S NOT GONNA LOOK COOL
ON THE FRONT OF A CAR.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.170
TO ME,
THAT'S WHAT I WAS SEEING.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.214
AND THEN JUST SHINE IT UP,
LIKE, BLING IT OUT.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.256
- I MEAN, HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE GONNA DO SKULLS AND FLAMES?

08:27.340 --> 08:28.424
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN
SKULLS AND FLAMES?

08:28.507 --> 08:29.342
- I DON'T KNOW.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.843
- SKULLS AND FLAME
FIT THIS CAR.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.429
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO DO.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.517
- THERE'S PEOPLE
DOING FILIGREE

08:38.601 --> 08:41.187
AND ALL KINDS
OF REALLY COOL STUFF.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.105
- WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK?
LIKE, SPEAK YOUR MIND.

08:43.188 --> 08:43.940
OUR ASS IS ON THE LINE.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.275
- WELL, I GOTTA
START PRACTICING.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.985
YOU GUYS HAVE TO HANDLE
THE DESIGN AND ARTWORK.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.278
- HE'S NOT LETTING ME
DO ANYTHING.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.696
SO I DON'T KNOW--
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

08:50.780 --> 08:51.781
- I DON'T CARE.
LIKE,<i> SOMETHING.</i>

08:51.864 --> 08:52.949
- DRAW THE BOTTOM DESIGN.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.201
- IT'S JUST,
GRILLE WITH SKULL AND FLAMES

08:55.284 --> 08:57.078
IS SUPER NORMAL.
- I FEEL SOME TENSION.

08:57.161 --> 08:59.705
DANGER AND JACKIE DON'T LIKE ME
TRYING TO TAKE CONTROL.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.333
I JUST THINK WE CAN CREATE A LOT
OF TEXTURE WITH THE SKULL.

09:02.416 --> 09:05.378
- WITH THE SANDER?
- YEAH, WITH THE SANDER.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.631
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
TWO HOURS LEFT.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.633
TWO MORE HOURS.

09:23.562 --> 09:25.439
{\an8}- I HAVE A TWO-MINUTE TIME
TOLERANCE FOR MYSTICAL MIKE.

09:25.523 --> 09:26.399
{\an8}- LET'S PUT THIS
ON TOP OF HERE,

09:26.482 --> 09:28.192
{\an8}MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER
TO WORK ON.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.026
{\an8}- NO, I'M FINE RIGHT HERE.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.444
{\an8}- YOU'RE GOOD RIGHT THERE?
- YEAH.

09:30.528 --> 09:31.487
{\an8}- I'M BRINGING MY JOB EXPERIENCE
TO THE TABLE

09:31.570 --> 09:34.156
{\an8}AND MY WISDOM FROM BEING
IN ENGINEERING SCHOOL.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.992
{\an8}SO MY OBJECTIVE IS TO APPLY
MORE TECHNICAL

09:36.075 --> 09:37.868
{\an8}THAN CREATIVE KNOWLEDGE
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS PIECE.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.496
{\an8}WE CAN CUT THIS OUT HERE,
SO IT KIND OF, LIKE, HAS, LIKE,

09:40.579 --> 09:42.373
{\an8}THIS, LIKE--THIS WOULD BE
CUT OUT, THIS WOULD BE SOLID.

09:42.456 --> 09:43.374
{\an8}THIS WOULD BE CUT OUT.
THIS WOULD BE SOLID.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.834
{\an8}THIS WOULD BE CUT OUT.
THIS WOULD BE SOLID.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.253
{\an8}- DEFINITELY, THIS IS NOT
WHO I WANTED TO BE WORKING WITH.

09:47.336 --> 09:50.131
CRAIG'S A GREAT ARTIST,
I'M EXCITED TO WORK WITH HIM,

09:50.214 --> 09:52.383
BUT MYSTICAL MIKE
IS A CHALLENGE.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.051
- THE NAME OF THE GAME IS
LISTENING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.052
- DUDE, SHUT UP.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.681
- HIS MIND IS SO CONVOLUTED
WITH CRAZINESS.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.850
YOU WANT TO GRAB SOME MASKS
FOR US, PLEASE, MIKE?

10:00.933 --> 10:03.394
{\an8}- WHAT REALLY MAKES ME SHINE
AS AN ARTIST IS MY ABILITY

10:03.477 --> 10:05.688
{\an8}TO WORK THROUGH
A DIFFICULT SITUATION,

10:05.771 --> 10:06.188
{\an8}OPPOSED TO AN EASIER ONE.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.734
YEAH, COOL BEANS.

10:09.817 --> 10:13.779
- ONE HOUR, GUYS.
ONE HOUR REMAINING.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.574
{\an8}- ONE HOUR LEFT.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.200
{\an8}- OKAY, WE GOTTA MOVE IT.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.035
{\an8}I'M DEFINITELY TAKING
A LEADERSHIP ROLE

10:19.118 --> 10:20.202
{\an8}IN THIS SITUATION.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.912
I WANT YOU GUYS TO BRING IT
ALL THE WAY TO THE EDGE,

10:21.996 --> 10:22.997
AND I'M GONNA WORK
ON THE OUTSIDE HERE.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.290
- ALL RIGHT, GET THIS THING.

10:24.373 --> 10:25.499
- EVERY TIME I'VE EVER
PICKED UP A NEW TOOL,

10:25.583 --> 10:26.167
I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO DO IT SUCCESSFULLY.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.586
- YOU THINK WE GOT THIS?

10:28.669 --> 10:30.379
- IF WE CAN FINISH IT,
WE GOT IT.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.714
{\an8}ALL I CAN DO IS HAVE FAITH
THAT JOSHUA

10:31.797 --> 10:33.341
{\an8}HAD ENOUGH TIME TO PRACTICE.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.718
{\an8}BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT PRECISE
IN YOUR CUTTING ABILITIES,

10:35.801 --> 10:38.262
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA SCREW UP
THE WHOLE GRILLE.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.639
{\an8}- 15 MINUTES TO GO, EVERYBODY.
15 MINUTES.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.229
{\an8}- IT FEELS LIKE THE OPPOSITE
OF A NEEDLE.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.898
{\an8}LIKE, A NEEDLE--
FOR TATTOOING, WE PUSH AWAY,

10:48.981 --> 10:50.399
{\an8}AND THIS,
YOU KIND OF PULL IT IN.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.233
{\an8}- MYSTICAL MIKE TALKS SO MUCH.

10:51.317 --> 10:54.403
{\an8}YOU JUST WANT HIM TO SHUT UP.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.866
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT,
SEVEN, SIX,

10:58.949 --> 11:04.455
FIVE, FOUR, THREE,
TWO, ONE.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.957
THAT'S IT. TIME'S UP.
MACHINES DOWN.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.751
- WHOO!
- ALL RIGHT.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.127
- GO COLLECT OUR SKULLS.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.504
- GOOD GIRL.
- YUP.

11:11.587 --> 11:12.755
- I'D PUT THAT ON MY CAR.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.215
THAT'S SICK AS [bleep].

11:14.298 --> 11:15.299
- CAR NUMBER ONE.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.593
{\an8}- I LIKE HOW IT HAVE
THE LITTLE SHINY PART THERE,

11:17.676 --> 11:19.553
{\an8}SO IT KIND OF REFLECT
WHEN THE SUN HIT IT.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.056
- YEAH, THAT WAS
TATU BABY'S IDEA

11:22.139 --> 11:23.516
OF ADDING DIFFERENT TEXTURES
IN THERE

11:23.599 --> 11:24.850
SO THAT THE TOP WOULD BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE SHINIER,

11:24.934 --> 11:26.060
GIVE IT MORE OF, LIKE,
A FEATHER LOOK.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.104
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR PRECISION,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS

11:28.187 --> 11:29.814
DEFINITELY GOT SOME NICE,
SHARP CUTS IN THERE.

11:29.897 --> 11:34.485
I LIKE THE SYMMETRY TO IT.
FROM A DISTANCE, IT LOOKS GREAT.

11:34.568 --> 11:35.778
- CAR NUMBER THREE.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.406
{\an8}- IT'S JUST STANDARD SKULL
AND FLAMES,

11:38.489 --> 11:40.032
{\an8}BUT THE WAY IT FITS IN THERE
IS REALLY COOL.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.242
IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING
THAT WOULD BE

11:41.325 --> 11:42.159
A WORKING PIECE OF A GRILLE

11:42.243 --> 11:43.744
'CAUSE IT DOES HAVE A LOT
OF AIRFLOW.

11:43.828 --> 11:44.745
- I MEAN,
AS FAR AS PRECISION GOES,

11:44.829 --> 11:46.539
I THINK YOU MADE GOOD USE
OF THAT,

11:46.622 --> 11:49.375
IN TERMS OF JUST ADDING
LITTLE DETAILS TO THAT SKULL.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.292
- I LIKE THE FLAMES.

11:50.376 --> 11:54.046
I WOULD DEFINITELY PUT THAT
ON MY CAR.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.589
- CAR NUMBER FIVE.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.925
{\an8}- YOU HAVE THE CURVIEST CAR.
YOU HAVE THE SEXIEST CAR.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.677
{\an8}AND YOU WERE ABLE
TO PULL OFF THE LOOK

11:59.760 --> 12:01.804
{\an8}WITH A BIT OF A HARDER EDGE
TO IT, USING THE SKULLS.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.806
{\an8}- I LIKE THE SKULL HEADS.
THE ONLY THING,

12:03.889 --> 12:05.599
{\an8}I THINK THERE COULD'VE BEEN
A LITTLE BIT MORE SPACE

12:05.683 --> 12:08.227
{\an8}ON THE BACK
OF THE SKULL HEADS,

12:08.310 --> 12:11.021
{\an8}SO YOU CAN REALLY TELL
WHAT IT IS.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.983
{\an8}- TEAM FIVE LOST IT
WITH THE SKULLS FACING INWARD.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.860
{\an8}THEY DIDN'T REALLY FIT THE CAR.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.736
{\an8}- CAR NUMBER FOUR.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.114
{\an8}- I LIKE HOW DELICATE
THE SPIDER WEB IS.

12:20.197 --> 12:20.781
{\an8}YOU COULD'VE PUT
A LITTLE MORE DETAIL

12:20.865 --> 12:21.907
{\an8}INTO THE BOTTOM DESIGN TOO.

12:21.991 --> 12:25.536
{\an8}- I THINK YOU GUYS EXECUTED
PRECISION REALLY WELL

12:25.619 --> 12:28.289
{\an8}IN TERMS OF MAKING ALL
THOSE LITTLE CUTS IN THE WEB.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.249
{\an8}CAR NUMBER TWO.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.792
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE IT COULD'VE BEEN

12:31.876 --> 12:33.127
{\an8}MORE EXOTIC.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.129
IT JUST LOOK
A LITTLE SIMPLE TO ME.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.047
LIKE, THEY CUT A LOT
OF STRAIGHT LINES.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.508
- I THINK WE ALL AGREED
THAT WE DIDN'T FIND A LOT

12:39.592 --> 12:41.010
EXCEPT FOR STRAIGHT LINES
ON THE CAR,

12:41.093 --> 12:41.677
SO WE DIDN'T REALLY WANT
TO START OUT

12:41.760 --> 12:45.055
WITH A BUNCH OF SCROLLING WORK.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.683
- I WAS HOPING THEIRS WOULD BE
MORE MYSTICAL, HONESTLY.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.060
- YEAH, THAT [bleep] WAS
A LITTLE TOO STRAIGHT EDGE.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.520
{\an8}OUR GRILLE WAS MORE UNIQUE

12:51.604 --> 12:52.771
{\an8}AND PRECISE THAN ANY
OTHER GRILLE IN THIS CHALLENGE,

12:52.855 --> 12:57.651
{\an8}SO I'M CONFIDENT
THAT WE'RE GONNA WIN.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.570

ARE YOU HERE TO GET ATTENTION?

12:59.653 --> 13:01.530

13:01.614 --> 13:04.200

13:04.283 --> 13:04.992

13:09.038 --> 13:10.664

13:13.375 --> 13:14.710
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, PRECISION.

13:14.793 --> 13:18.339
LET'S START WITH CAR NUMBER ONE,
TATU BABY, E.S., AND JIME.

13:18.422 --> 13:20.382
- AS FAR AS PRECISION GOES,
I REALLY DIDN'T SEE

13:20.466 --> 13:21.425
A LOT OF DETAIL
IN THE WINGS.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.384
I WISH THERE WAS MORE.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.887
- CAR NUMBER TWO,
KYLE, CRAIG, AND MIKE,

13:24.970 --> 13:27.223
WHICH WAS PRIMARILY
ALL STRAIGHT LINES.

13:27.306 --> 13:28.724
- I JUST THINK
IT WAS TOO PLAIN.

13:28.807 --> 13:32.561
I THINK THEY HAD ENOUGH TIME
TO COME UP WITH A BETTER IDEA.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.564
- JOEY, JACKIE, AND JAMES
WERE CAR NUMBER THREE.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.359
- ARTISTICALLY, THE DESIGN, IT
REALLY DOES FLOW WITH THE CAR.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.736
- AND THERE WAS ALSO
SOME NICE DETAIL IN THE SKULL.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.321
- I THINK
THAT'S MY FAVORITE CAR.

13:42.404 --> 13:44.657
- MADDIE, CHRIS, AND RICH
PULLED TOGETHER REALLY NICELY

13:44.740 --> 13:45.866
ON CAR NUMBER FOUR.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.911
- THAT CHOICE OF DESIGN
SHOWS A LOT OF IMPERFECTIONS.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.079
THAT'S WHAT KILLS IT FOR ME.

13:50.162 --> 13:52.665
- CAR NUMBER FIVE,
JOSHUA, JASON, AND ALLY,

13:52.748 --> 13:54.500
WAS ACTUALLY
MY FAVORITE DESIGN.

13:54.583 --> 13:55.584
- IT WAS PRECISE.
EVERYTHING WAS STRAIGHT.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.586
EVERYTHING WAS CLEAN-CUT.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.088
- IT SEEMS LIKE
WE HAVE A CLEAR DECISION.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.090
LET'S GO TELL THEM.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.928
TODAY WE ASKED YOU TO SHOW US
YOUR MASTERY OF PRECISION

CUSTOM GRILLE FOR A LOWRIDER.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.768
OVERALL, THE JUDGES
WERE VERY IMPRESSED.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.937
- WE LIKED THE TEAMWORK IN BOTH
NUMBER THREE AND NUMBER FIVE.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.898
IT SEEMED LIKE THE FLOW
OF BOTH GRILLES REALLY MATCHED

14:17.982 --> 14:20.442

THE BEST.

{\an8}- AN ANATOMICAL TATTOO?
DO I LOOK LIKE A SURGEON?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.417
{\an8}I'M NOT.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.170
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.759
JOEY, JACKIE, AND JAMES,

17:31.842 --> 17:34.511
BECAUSE THE THREE OF YOU
WON THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

17:34.595 --> 17:36.513
YOU NOW HAVE
THE POWER TO ASSIGN

17:36.597 --> 17:37.639
ALL THE HUMAN CANVASES
TOGETHER.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.808
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.769
{\an8}IT'S STILL SO EARLY
IN THE COMPETITION

17:41.852 --> 17:43.645
{\an8}THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA GUN
FOR THE TOP PEOPLE,

17:43.729 --> 17:44.730
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA PUT THE BIGGER
TARGET ON YOUR OWN BACK.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.940
{\an8}- I WANT THE TWO ARM BONES.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.233
{\an8}- VERTEBRAE GOING
RIGHT DOWN MY SPINE.

17:48.317 --> 17:52.654
{\an8}- I WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE A LION
HAS RIPPED OFF MY BUTT CHEEK.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.365
{\an8}- NOW, WHAT?

17:55.449 --> 17:57.076
{\an8}- HE JUST TOOK THAT MEAT.

17:57.159 --> 18:00.996
{\an8}- I WANT AN ANATOMICAL
IN MY RIGHT ARMPIT.

18:04.583 --> 18:07.086
{\an8}- [bleep].

18:07.169 --> 18:08.086
{\an8}PLEASE, DON'T PUT ME
IN THE ARMPIT.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.717
{\an8}- TO ME, THE HARDEST ONE IS
GONNA BE THE ARMPIT.

18:13.801 --> 18:14.802
{\an8}- YEAH, LET'S THINK
ABOUT THAT ONE.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.512
{\an8}- I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE
I'M PROBABLY SOMEBODY

18:16.595 --> 18:18.639
{\an8}THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO GIVE
SOMETHING DIFFICULT TO.

18:18.722 --> 18:19.807
{\an8}- GIVE HIM THAT ONE.

18:19.890 --> 18:20.933
{\an8}JOSHUA CAME HERE
WITH A GAME PLAN.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.353
{\an8}AND THE WAY HE'S BEEN ACTING
AND KIND OF BACKSTABBY,

18:24.436 --> 18:26.605
{\an8}I JUST CAN'T RESPECT
A MAN WHO DOES THAT.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.357
- THAT WAS ROUGH.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.359
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

18:30.442 --> 18:31.777
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.655
- JACKIE.
- JOEY.

18:34.738 --> 18:36.907
- THERE WE GO.
- KYLE.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.617
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT
THE 52-YEAR-OLD MAN,

18:38.700 --> 18:42.162
{\an8}BUT I'M MAKING THE BEST OF IT
'CAUSE I DIDN'T GET THE ARMPIT.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.297
{\an8}- JOSHUA.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.799
- SOMEONE'S GUNNING
FOR YOU, JOSHUA.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.385
{\an8}- MY MESSAGE
TO THE THREE STOOGES,

18:56.468 --> 18:58.345
{\an8}[bleep] BRING IT.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.014
- E.S.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.267
- JAMES.
- RIGHT HERE, BRO.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.560
- MADDIE.
- RIGHT HERE.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.227
- CHRIS.
- HEY, BUDDY.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.897
- MYSTICAL MIKE.
- ALLY.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.733
- JIME.
- JASON.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.570
- TATU BABY.
- CRAIG.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.571
- MADE RICH.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.074
- REMEMBER,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

19:19.157 --> 19:20.826
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

19:20.909 --> 19:23.161
THAT THEY THINK
IS THE WORST

19:23.245 --> 19:25.789
AND PUT ONE ARTIST UP
FOR FOR ELIMINATION.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.583
YOU HAVE
THE REST OF THE EVENING

19:27.666 --> 19:29.376
TO CONSULT
WITH YOUR HUMAN CANVASES.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.378
AND TOMORROW,
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS

19:31.461 --> 19:33.672
TO COMPLETE
YOUR ANATOMICAL TATTOO.

19:33.755 --> 19:37.301
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.469
GOOD LUCK.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.471
{\an8}- WHETHER IT BE AN ORGAN,
MUSCLE TISSUE, OR BONE,

19:41.555 --> 19:45.183
{\an8}WE WANT TO SEE THESE PEOPLE
USE THEIR SKILLS IN PRECISION

19:45.267 --> 19:47.060
{\an8}TO MAKE THIS TATTOO
LOOK EXACT.

19:47.144 --> 19:48.312
{\an8}- COME ON BACK THIS WAY.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.606
{\an8}- I'M GOING TO SCHOOL
TO BECOME A SCIENTIST.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.816
{\an8}- VERY AWESOME.
I'M A SCIENCE GEEK MYSELF.

19:52.900 --> 19:53.734
{\an8}I WAS AN E.M.T.
WHILE I WAS IN ART SCHOOL.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.944
{\an8}MY PREVIOUS MEDICAL EXPERIENCE

19:56.028 --> 19:57.946
{\an8}DEFINITELY GIVES ME THE EDGE
IN THIS CHALLENGE.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.157
ARE YOU A FAN OF MUSIC AT ALL?
- YES.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.283
- WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN POSSIBLY DOING A "G" CLEF

20:01.366 --> 20:04.995
WITH THE MUSCULAR TISSUE EXPOSED
IN THE NEGATIVE SPACE?

20:05.078 --> 20:06.663
- THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY,
REALLY COOL.

20:06.747 --> 20:07.706
- YOU'RE TOTALLY INTO THAT?
- YEAH.

20:07.789 --> 20:08.582
- OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS JUST GREAT.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.167
LIKE, OH, BOY.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.461
- HERE'S MY PORTFOLIO.
- GREAT.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.130
{\an8}- SHE WANTS A SKIN TEAR
IN HER ARMPIT.

20:15.213 --> 20:17.925
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO MEET YOU.
I CAN'T WAIT TO TATTOO YOU.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.217
- LIKEWISE.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.886
- THEY THINK THEY GAVE ME
THE TOUGHEST ONE,

20:20.969 --> 20:23.180
BUT I HAVE A WAY
OF WORKING WITH PEOPLE

20:23.263 --> 20:25.599
THAT IS GONNA MAKE THIS EASY
FOR ME.

20:25.682 --> 20:28.977
EVERYBODY WANTS ME TO TALK YOU
OUT OF DOING YOUR ARMPIT.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.230
- OH, YEAH?
- BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT THAT,

20:31.313 --> 20:32.773
I WOULD HATE
TO TALK YOU OUT OF IT.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.316
- I WANT IT.
IT'S UNIQUE, YOU KNOW?

20:34.399 --> 20:35.484
- MM-HMM.
- IT'S DIFFERENT.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.819
- AND YOU ARE
OBVIOUSLY UNIQUE.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.863
I MIGHT BE KIND OF SCREWED
ON THIS ONE.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.078
- WHAT UP, MIKE?

20:46.161 --> 20:47.245
- HOW'S IT GOING, JOEY?
WHAT'S GOOD?

20:47.329 --> 20:48.705
- OH, YOU GOT
THE ANATOMICAL HEART, RIGHT?

20:48.789 --> 20:50.499
- YEAH.
- WICKED, DUDE.

20:50.582 --> 20:51.333
LIKE, THAT'S DEFINITELY A LOT
MORE DETAILED THAN WHAT I HAVE.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.503
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?
- A MUSIC NOTE.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.214
A "G" CLEF ON THE BICEP.
- OH, COOL.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.174
- YEAH, I THINK ME AND JOSH
GOT OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US

20:59.257 --> 21:01.051
COMPARED TO ANYBODY ELSE
AT THIS POINT.

21:01.134 --> 21:02.928
- YEAH, NONE OF THEM ARE EASY.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.013
- I'VE NEVER DONE
AN ANATOMICAL TATTOO,

21:05.097 --> 21:07.349
BUT I'M GONNA ROCK IT NO MATTER
WHAT, AND I COULD BE IN THE TOP

21:07.432 --> 21:09.434
WITH MY SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
IN BIOLOGY.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.311
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
MIKE'S THINKING.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.689
HERE'S HIS DESIGN RIGHT HERE.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.899
- WOW.
YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT THAT IS.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.651
- YOU'RE NOT REALLY GETTING
TO SEE MUSCLE TISSUE.

21:17.734 --> 21:20.153
- NO.
- NEXT.

21:20.237 --> 21:20.862
{\an8}- THIS GUY JUST MIGHT AS WELL
PACK HIS [bleep]

21:20.946 --> 21:22.531
{\an8}AND GO HOME NOW.

21:22.614 --> 21:27.953
{\an8}- ARTISTS, YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO CREATE AN ANATOMICAL TATTOO,

21:28.036 --> 21:31.957
{\an8}AND YOUR TIME BEGINS...
NOW.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.875
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.
- LET'S DO IT UP.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.043
{\an8}- ANATOMICAL THEME
FOR THIS ELIMINATION CHALLENGE.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.838
{\an8}JUDGING PRECISION
IS REALLY GOOD

21:37.921 --> 21:40.048
{\an8}BECAUSE THE INNER ANATOMY
OF THE BODY IS VERY COMPLEX.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.216
YOU HAVE
TO BE VERY PRECISE

21:41.299 --> 21:43.844
TO MAKE ALL THESE THINGS
LOOK REALISTIC.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.304
- OH, MY GOD, IT'S NOT EVEN DONE
YET, AND THAT LOOKS SICK.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.266
- THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.
ALL RIGHT.

21:49.349 --> 21:51.309
- POUND!
- YES.

21:51.393 --> 21:52.853
- I LIKE THAT.

21:52.936 --> 21:55.731
- MY CANVAS WANTS TO GET
HIS BONES ON TOP OF HIS HAND.

21:55.814 --> 21:59.985
{\an8}HE WANTS THEM TO GO ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO HIS [bleep] UP FINGERS.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.988
WITH AS MUCH ARTHRITIS
AS YOU HAVE IN YOUR FINGERS,

22:03.071 --> 22:04.948
I MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE THE FINGER
JOINTS A LITTLE BIGGER.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.575
- AS LONG AS IT MATCHES.

22:06.658 --> 22:09.202
- HIS MITT IS TOO SWOLLEN,
TOO BIG.

22:09.286 --> 22:12.622
IT'S NOT AT ALL LIKE THE STENCIL
THAT I WAS WORKING OFF OF.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.666
YOU GOT A GREAT BIG MITT, MAN.

22:14.750 --> 22:15.709
I HAVE TO SHOW PRECISION HERE,

22:15.792 --> 22:18.295
SO WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FREEHAND

22:18.378 --> 22:19.254
SOME FINGER PIECES IN.

22:19.337 --> 22:19.755
[tattoo machine buzzing]

22:19.838 --> 22:22.090
HERE WE GO.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.177
[tattoo machines buzzing]

22:29.097 --> 22:33.310
{\an8}- MY CANVAS WANTED PLAIN, SIMPLE
CAT SCRATCHES ON HER BUTT.

22:33.393 --> 22:35.812
BUT WHAT I CAME BACK WITH
WAS BETTER.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.398
IT'S AN ANATOMICAL PART
INSIDE OF HER THIGH.

22:38.482 --> 22:42.110
AND THERE'S A BOW SEWN
IN AND OUT OF IT.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.779
I DEFINITELY THREW HER
THE IDEA

22:43.862 --> 22:44.905
OF DOING SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.031
NOBODY REALLY HAS THIS.

22:46.114 --> 22:46.990
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

22:47.074 --> 22:49.618
THAT I LEARNED LAST SEASON.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.788
I AM NOT HERE
TO PLAY IT SAFE.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.880
{\an8}- MY CANVAS
WANTS HER ARMPIT TATTOOED

23:01.963 --> 23:04.049
{\an8}WITH AN ANATOMICAL HEART.
- [cries out]

23:04.132 --> 23:05.842
- I REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE
TO IMPRESS THE JUDGES.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.095
- WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO GET THIS
IN YOUR ARMPIT?

23:08.178 --> 23:09.262
- I CAN'T.

23:09.346 --> 23:12.099
- THE DESIGN IS
WHAT'S REALLY THROWING ME OFF.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.975
I CAN TELL IT'S A HEART,
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,

23:14.059 --> 23:14.935
THERE'S SOME ELEMENTS
IN THIS THING

23:15.018 --> 23:17.562
THAT ARE VERY QUESTIONABLE.
- I CAN'T.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.106
- WE'LL COME BACK IN A BIT.

23:19.189 --> 23:20.232
- YEAH, MAN, YOU GUYS GOT
YOUR HANDS FULL.

23:20.315 --> 23:22.901
- I CAN'T--OW.
- YOU CAN.

23:22.984 --> 23:25.320
- OH, MY GOD.
- YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

23:25.403 --> 23:26.947
- [groans]

23:27.030 --> 23:28.615
- FOUR HOURS TO GO,
EVERYBODY.

23:28.698 --> 23:32.702
{\an8}- MY CANVAS WANTS
A ROTTEN RIB CAGE

23:32.786 --> 23:34.830
{\an8}WITH PINK GUTS HANGING OUT.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.873
{\an8}I'M REALLY GONNA SHOW
LOTS OF PRECISION

23:36.957 --> 23:38.125
{\an8}IN THE PLACEMENT OF IT.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.418
THIS IS COMING TOGETHER
SO GREAT.

23:40.502 --> 23:43.338
- ALL RIGHT.
- "OH, HERE YOU GO, MADISON.

23:43.421 --> 23:46.299
WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOU
$800,000 NOW."

23:46.383 --> 23:48.552
THE JUDGES MIGHT BE LOOKING
FOR MORE

23:48.635 --> 23:50.846
OF A REALISTIC LOOK
TO MY TATTOO.

23:50.929 --> 23:54.015
I'M TAKING A RISK.
I MIGHT REALLY STAND OUT

23:54.099 --> 23:57.978
BY DOING SOMETHING
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

23:58.061 --> 24:00.522
{\an8}- I'M DOING A "G" CLEF STAFF
CUT OUT

24:00.605 --> 24:01.857
{\an8}OF THE DELTOID MUSCLE,

24:01.940 --> 24:04.025
{\an8}AS IF IT WAS SURGICALLY REMOVED
FROM THE BODY.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.694
SO I'M GONNA DO
PARTIAL SATURATION

24:05.777 --> 24:07.737
AND THEN BUILD UP
DURING THE PROCESS.

24:07.821 --> 24:08.780
- WHAT IS THIS TATTOO?

24:08.864 --> 24:13.827
I HAVE NO IDEA.
THAT'S NOT ANATOMICAL AT ALL.

24:13.910 --> 24:17.372
- ONE HOUR TO GO.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.542
- OH, MY GOD.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.630
- BRO, YOU GOT TO PUT THE PEDAL
TO THE METAL.

24:25.714 --> 24:26.840
- I KNOW I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

24:26.923 --> 24:29.509
- E.S. HAS A BIG PROBLEM
WITH TIME MANAGEMENT.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.011
I PERSONALLY DON'T SEE ANY WAY

24:31.094 --> 24:32.387
THAT HE'S GONNA FINISH
THIS TATTOO.

24:32.471 --> 24:33.555
- I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.182
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA TALK TO YOU.
- YEAH.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.517
- 15 MINUTES, EVERYBODY.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.395
{\an8}- HE WANTS HIS RIB CAGE
TATTOOED, SO I SAID,

24:40.478 --> 24:41.646
{\an8}"INSTEAD OF GOING IN,

24:41.730 --> 24:43.398
{\an8}I'M GONNA BRING SOMETHING OUT
OF THE SKIN."

24:43.481 --> 24:45.108
I'M GONNA LEAVE
SOME SKIN AND STUFF.

24:45.192 --> 24:48.111
THAT WAY, IT'S LIKE,
SOME TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS TO IT.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.362
I KNOW I'M TAKING A RISK
WITH THIS DESIGN,

24:49.446 --> 24:52.532
BUT I'M FOLLOWING
THE ACTUAL RIB CAGE,

24:52.616 --> 24:55.368
AND I HOPE THAT IT PAYS OFF.

24:55.452 --> 25:00.415
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT,
SEVEN, SIX,

25:00.498 --> 25:05.420
FIVE, FOUR, THREE,
TWO, ONE.

25:05.503 --> 25:08.423
THAT'S IT. TIME'S UP.
MACHINES DOWN.

25:08.506 --> 25:09.758
NO MORE INK.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.427
- IT TURNED OUT SO GOOD.
- I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.679
THIS IS, LIKE, MY FAVORITE
MUSIC TATTOO I'VE EVER DONE NOW.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.515
- I LOVE IT.
- ME TOO.

25:17.599 --> 25:18.058
- SEE WHAT HAPPENS
FROM HERE, MAN.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.936
{\an8}I DIDN'T FINISH IT.

25:21.019 --> 25:22.103
{\an8}IT'S A POSSIBILITY
THAT I COULD BE THE ONE

25:22.187 --> 25:26.566
{\an8}TO GO HOME ON THIS ONE.

25:26.650 --> 25:27.651
{\an8}- MAYBE YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND
THE ANATOMY BOOK.

25:27.734 --> 25:28.652
{\an8}- HEY, SHUT THE [bleep] UP

25:28.735 --> 25:30.278
{\an8}BEFORE I PUT MY FOOT
IN YOUR MOUTH.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.030
- THERE'S NOTHING TO JUDGE,
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.573
- YOU ARE [bleep] OUT.

25:33.657 --> 25:34.950
- COME ON,
TAKE A [bleep] SWING.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.743
- Y'ALL BETTER GET
THIS [bleep] RIGHT NOW.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.626
- I DIDN'T SEE A LOT
OF PEOPLE'S TATTOOS FINISHED UP.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.295
- THE ONLY ONE THAT I REALLY SAW
THAT I THOUGHT WAS BAD WAS MIKE.

25:47.379 --> 25:52.550
IT WAS A TREBLE CLEF THAT WAS
NOT ANY PART OF THIS CHALLENGE.

25:52.634 --> 25:55.303
- I THOUGHT
THAT YOUR ANATOMICAL TATTOO

25:55.387 --> 25:58.348
WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE,
I DON'T KNOW, ANATOMICAL.

25:58.431 --> 25:59.808
- I TOOK
A LITTLE MORE CREATIVE LEEWAY.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.434
- YOU'RE HERE
FOR A COMPETITION.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.770
- THANK YOU FOR POINTING OUT
THE TOTALLY OBVIOUS.

26:03.853 --> 26:04.980
I CAN'T GET
THE SPOTLIGHT OFF ME.

26:05.063 --> 26:08.191
IT COULD POSSIBLY BE BECAUSE
OF MY OBSCURE PHILOSOPHY,

26:08.275 --> 26:10.151
MY GOOD LOOKS,
MY CREATIVE ABILITY.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.111
TAKE YOUR PICK.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.113
- WE'RE HERE TO COMPETE
AS TATTOO ARTISTS,

26:13.196 --> 26:13.780
AND YOU DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

26:13.863 --> 26:16.324
- I THINK HE GENUINELY IS HERE

26:16.408 --> 26:18.118
BECAUSE HE'S REALLY PASSIONATE
ABOUT IT.

26:18.201 --> 26:21.830
- WHAT?
- I TOTALLY FEEL BAD FOR MIKE.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.832
{\an8}THAT'S WHY I COME
TO HIS RESCUE SOMETIMES.

26:23.915 --> 26:27.127
- I PUT EVERYTHING INTO THIS.
I TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.169
AND TO HAVE YOU COME HERE AND
MAKE A GODDAMN JOKE OUT OF IT

26:28.253 --> 26:33.133
PISSES ME OFF, MAN.

26:47.605 --> 26:50.900
- THIS WEEK, WE HAD YOU CREATE
AN ANATOMICAL TATTOO

26:50.984 --> 26:53.278
USING PRECISION
TO MAKE IT LOOK EXACTLY

26:53.361 --> 26:54.279
LIKE THE INSIDE OF THE BODY.

26:54.362 --> 26:57.907
JOEY, LET'S START WITH YOU.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.245
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HEART,
THE VEINS, AND THE VALVES

27:02.329 --> 27:03.747
IS TERRIFIC.

27:03.830 --> 27:06.166
MY PROBLEM IS
WITH THE SKIN RIP ITSELF.

27:06.249 --> 27:08.293
- HE WANTED IT TO LOOK LIKE
IT WAS OUT ON TOP OF HIS SKIN.

27:08.376 --> 27:12.005
- I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SKIN.

27:12.088 --> 27:12.964
- AS FAR AS PRECISION GOES,

27:13.048 --> 27:14.466
THE LITTLE DETAILS
YOU PUT IN HERE

27:14.549 --> 27:15.383
AND THE LITTLE CREASES
AND LINES AND FOLDS,

27:15.467 --> 27:16.593
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

27:16.676 --> 27:20.555
THE HEART LOOKS REALISTIC.
THE SKIN DOES NOT.

27:22.098 --> 27:24.976
- MADDIE.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.397
- TODAY I REALLY JUST TRIED
TO KEEP IT ANATOMICALLY,

27:29.481 --> 27:31.775
LIKE, IN THE RIGHT POSITION.

27:31.858 --> 27:33.068
- THIS THING'S VERY CARTOONY.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.570
YOU HAVE AN ABUNDANCE
OF SKETCHY LINES.

27:35.653 --> 27:36.613
- ARE YOU TA--
IN THE BONES?

27:36.696 --> 27:37.572
- I'M SAYING IN THIS TATTOO,

27:37.655 --> 27:40.658
THERE IS A LOT
OF SKETCHY LINES THROUGHOUT.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.912
IF YOU CAN'T GET THIS [bleep]
IN SOLID AND GET IT IN TIGHT,

27:43.995 --> 27:45.080
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.499
- I THINK I'M DOING
A REALLY DAMN GOOD JOB.

27:47.582 --> 27:50.293
AND I THINK I DID BETTER
THAN A LOT OF THE OTHER TATTOOS.

27:50.377 --> 27:51.920
- I THINK
YOU MIGHT JUST BE OUTCLASSED.

27:52.003 --> 27:55.090
- [sniffling]

27:55.173 --> 27:59.511
- CHRIS.

27:59.594 --> 28:01.596
- IF WE WERE HAVING
A "CRAZY, NEW-SCHOOL TATTOO

28:01.679 --> 28:04.182
THAT NOBODY CAN TELL
WHAT IT WAS" DAY,

28:04.265 --> 28:06.017
YOU WOULD WIN.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.561
PRECISION-WISE, YOU TECHNICALLY
DID A SOUND TATTOO.

28:08.645 --> 28:10.980
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
TO MAKE IT IN THIS COMPETITION

28:11.064 --> 28:12.273
IS PAY ATTENTION.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.983
WHEN DAVE TELLS YOU
WHAT THIS CHALLENGE IS,

28:14.067 --> 28:17.320
HE SAYS,
"YOU ARE CHALLENGED TO CREATE

28:17.404 --> 28:20.240
A TATTOO OF THE INNER ANATOMY
TO LOOK REAL."

28:20.323 --> 28:22.659
IF YOU FOLLOWED
THAT STRICT PARAMETER,

28:22.742 --> 28:25.787
THEN YOU AND A COUPLE
OTHER PEOPLE ARE [bleep] OUT.

28:28.164 --> 28:31.376
- E.S.

28:31.459 --> 28:32.293
DO YOU CONSIDER THIS PIECE
FINISHED?

28:32.377 --> 28:34.838
- COMPLETELY? NO.

28:34.921 --> 28:36.714
I KNOW
I COULD'VE PUT MORE INTO IT.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.174
- JUST LOOKING AT THE TATTOO,

28:38.258 --> 28:40.427
I CAN TELL IT NEED MORE WORK
TO BE DONE.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.345
I CAN SEE THE ROUTE
THAT YOU'RE GOING,

28:42.429 --> 28:44.139
BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE
YOU NEEDED MORE TIME.

28:44.222 --> 28:46.891
- I THINK I MIGHT HAVE SPENT
TOO MUCH TIME ON THE OUTLINE

28:46.975 --> 28:47.809
AND GIVING
THAT PRECISION EFFECT.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.061
- THERE'S A LOT OF PRECISE LINES
IN THIS.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.981
BUT TO JUDGE THIS,
IT AIN'T DONE.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.859
YOU HAVE GOT TO DO TATTOOS
THAT YOU CAN COMPLETE

28:55.942 --> 28:59.362
IN THE TIME ALLOWED.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.781
- KYLE.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.491
- THE DETAIL YOU GOT
IN THE BONES

29:03.575 --> 29:04.284
AND THE WAY THAT YOU LAID
THIS TATTOO OUT,

29:04.367 --> 29:07.036
PLACEMENT WAS INCREDIBLY HARD.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.455
MY THING ON THIS TATTOO
THAT I DON'T LIKE

29:08.538 --> 29:09.456
IS, OBVIOUSLY,
THE USE OF THE WHITE.

29:09.539 --> 29:12.500
- AS I WOULD DO A LINE
ON HIS HAND,

29:12.584 --> 29:14.127
THREE MINUTES LATER,
IT WAS BLOWN OUT.

29:14.210 --> 29:17.589
I STARTED TRYING TO HIDE
SOME OF IT WITH MY WHITE LINES.

29:17.672 --> 29:18.673
- ALL THAT WHITE WON'T HOLD,
AND IT PUTS YOUR CLIENT

29:18.756 --> 29:22.677
THROUGH A LOT OF EXTRA PAIN
FOR NO GAIN.

29:24.262 --> 29:28.016
- MADE RICH.

29:28.099 --> 29:30.602
- I THINK WE ALL HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THE BACKGROUND.

29:30.685 --> 29:32.020
LOOK AT THE COLOR
IN BETWEEN THE BONES.

29:32.103 --> 29:35.398
IF YOU WOULD'VE BEEN MORE DIRECT
WITH THAT FLOW ACROSS,

29:35.482 --> 29:37.025
IT WOULD'VE GIVEN YOU
THE DIMENSION.

29:37.108 --> 29:38.026
- I JUST WANTED TO FADE
INTO IT

29:38.109 --> 29:40.236
AND GIVE IT SOME TYPE
OF DESIGN ELEMENT.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.489
- I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH HOW
IMPORTANT BACKGROUNDS PLAY OUT.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.407
NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN,
AS WE'VE SEEN,

29:44.491 --> 29:46.284
THEY DON'T WORK IN THE END.

29:46.367 --> 29:49.704
IT THROWS
ALL YOUR HARD WORK OUT.

29:49.787 --> 29:51.789
- JAMES.

29:53.124 --> 29:56.961
- THE ACTUAL RIP OPEN PART
WHERE THE SKIN HAS THAT DEPTH

29:57.045 --> 29:59.214
AND IT GIVES THAT LITTLE FATTY
TISSUE, AND IT LOOKS GROSS,

29:59.297 --> 30:00.548
IT'S A PRETTY GOOD
LITTLE PART OF IT.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.592
AS FAR AS THE PRECISION GOES,

30:02.675 --> 30:05.053
THE BONE LOOKED LIKE
A GLOWING TEST TUBE-TYPE THING.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.055
IT DOESN'T COME OFF
LOOKING LIKE A BONE TO ME.

30:07.138 --> 30:10.558
I THINK YOU LOST IT
A LITTLE BIT.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.894
- TATU BABY.

30:12.977 --> 30:14.020
- I THINK PUTTING THE BOW IN
THERE WAS A GREAT IDEA FOR THIS,

30:14.103 --> 30:17.232
JUST TO BREAK IT UP AND GIVE IT
THAT FEMININE EDGE.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.484
AS FAR AS THE WHOLE TATTOO,
WHAT YOU GAVE US TODAY

30:19.567 --> 30:21.319
IS A MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD EFFORT.

30:21.402 --> 30:22.737
- IT LOOKS VERY ROCKY.

30:22.820 --> 30:25.240
YOUR BACKGROUND LOOKS ROCKY
MORE THAN FLESHY.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.449
WE KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF,

30:26.533 --> 30:28.785
AND WE'RE GONNA HOLD YOU
TO THAT STANDARD THE WHOLE RIDE.

30:28.868 --> 30:31.996
THIS ONE'S NOT A GOOD ONE.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.582
- JASON.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.376
- THIS TATTOO,
FROM A DISTANCE,

30:36.459 --> 30:37.627
IT'S HARD TO TELL
WHAT'S GOING ON.

30:37.710 --> 30:38.628
YOU DIDN'T GIVE YOURSELF
ENOUGH OPEN AREA

30:38.711 --> 30:41.881
TO GIVE ANY ONE SECTION DETAIL.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.801
IT'S A HARD-TO-READ TATTOO.

30:44.884 --> 30:47.053
- JIME.

30:47.136 --> 30:50.098
- DID THE CANVAS WANT IT
RIPPING OUT OF THE SKIN?

30:50.181 --> 30:51.474
- ALL HE WANTED WAS A SPINE.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.811
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT
IT ACTUALLY LOOKED REALISTIC.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.938
IT LOOKED LIKE THAT'S A PICTURE
ON THE GUY'S BACK.

30:57.021 --> 31:01.901
- I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS THING'S
COMPLETELY REALISTIC.

31:01.985 --> 31:04.571
THE WAY YOU SHADED IT, THOUGH,
AND THE PRECISION THAT YOU USED

31:04.654 --> 31:06.281
TO MAKE THIS TATTOO
COME TO LIFE,

31:06.364 --> 31:08.157
YOU DID PULL OFF
SOME COOL EFFECTS.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.118
IT'S A GOOD TATTOO.

31:10.201 --> 31:14.163
- JACKIE.

31:14.247 --> 31:17.875
- HOW MUCH RESEARCH DID YOU DO
ON THE SPINE?

31:17.959 --> 31:20.044
- I STAYED UP FOR HOURS TRYING
TO RESEARCH EACH SECTION.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.463
- YOU TOOK YOUR TIME TO PUT
THE DETAILS IN EACH BONE.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.631
YOU MADE IT LOOK LIKE BONE.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.842
IT DOESN'T COME OFF AS ROCKS.

31:25.925 --> 31:28.469
MORE THAN ANYTHING,
YOU REALLY SURPRISED ME.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.721
AND IT'S A GREAT SURPRISE.
- JACKIE, WELL DONE.

31:29.804 --> 31:31.639
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- THANK YOU, GUYS.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.309
I APPRECIATE IT.

31:34.392 --> 31:37.562
- ALLY.

31:37.645 --> 31:38.896
- THESE METAL CLAMPS
DON'T LOOK REALISTIC.

31:38.980 --> 31:42.650
AND ON TOP OF THAT,
THE DROP SHADOW UNDERNEATH THEM

31:42.734 --> 31:43.610
LOOKS ROUGH.

31:43.693 --> 31:45.528
YOU'VE GOT BLACK SHADING

31:45.612 --> 31:47.697
TO BROWN TO YELLOW TO WHITE.

31:47.780 --> 31:51.743
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE REALISTIC,
AND IT'S NOT COMING OFF.

31:51.826 --> 31:52.744
- CRAIG.

31:52.827 --> 31:55.163
- THE LITTLE DETAILS
YOU PUT IN HERE,

31:55.246 --> 31:57.832
THE PRECISE, FINE LINES
YOU PUT IN,

31:57.915 --> 32:00.168
THE STRANDS OF THOSE MUSCLES,
AND THE WAY YOU FOLLOWED IT

32:00.251 --> 32:01.919
WITH THE SHADING,
IT'S REALLY NICE.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.588
- THIS IS WHAT YOU GUYS
ARE COMPETING AGAINST.

32:03.671 --> 32:06.299
THIS IS WHAT WE COMPARE
ALL OF YOUR MUSCLE TISSUE TO.

32:06.382 --> 32:10.386
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS
WHAT YOU'RE FIGHTING, NOT ME.

32:10.470 --> 32:13.973
- JOSHUA.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.268
HOW WAS IT FOR YOU GOING
INTO THIS PARTICULAR CHALLENGE?

32:17.352 --> 32:18.603
- I WAS THROWN UNDER THE BUS.

32:18.686 --> 32:21.814
SHE WANTED
HER ARMPIT TATTOOED.

32:21.898 --> 32:24.275
- IT'S CLEARLY
AN ANATOMICAL HEART.

32:24.359 --> 32:25.193
GREAT USE OF PRECISION THERE.

32:25.276 --> 32:28.029
WHAT MAKES IT
NOT LOOK LIKE A HEART

32:28.112 --> 32:29.530
IS WHAT'S HAPPENING
AROUND IT.

32:29.614 --> 32:30.740
- SHE WANTED IT
TO LOOK LIKE IT WAS BONES

32:30.823 --> 32:32.867
THAT WERE KIND OF,
LIKE, SAWED OFF.

32:32.950 --> 32:34.827
- WHAT I LOOK AT
WHEN I SEE THIS

32:34.911 --> 32:38.873
IS STRANGELY BLUE-HIGHLIGHTED
MACARONI NOODLES.

32:38.956 --> 32:41.459
IT'S KILLING IT.

32:41.542 --> 32:44.879
- MYSTICAL MIKE.

32:44.962 --> 32:48.091
DO YOU FEEL THAT THIS DESIGN
HITS THE CHALLENGE?

32:48.174 --> 32:50.051
- I ACTUALLY DREW THE MUSCLE
STRANDS ON BY HAND

32:50.134 --> 32:51.886
TO CONFORM TO HER ANATOMY.
- CAN'T REALLY SAY MUCH

32:51.969 --> 32:54.555
ABOUT THE ANATOMICAL VALUE
OF THIS TATTOO,

32:54.639 --> 32:55.556
BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY
JUST A MUSIC NOTE

32:55.640 --> 32:57.642
WITH A SWIRLY BACKGROUND.

32:57.725 --> 32:59.143
- UPON CONTEMPLATION,
I WOULD'VE CHOSE

32:59.227 --> 33:01.562
THE INSIDE OF THE ARM,
EVEN THE BRACHIAL ARTERY.

33:01.646 --> 33:04.315
- YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THAT STUFF
IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.192
WE JUST CAN'T SEE ANY OF IT
IN HERE.

33:06.275 --> 33:07.568
- I KNOW. I WAS AN E.M.T.
IN MY COUNTY FOR FIVE YEARS

33:07.652 --> 33:08.486
WHEN I WENT TO ART SCHOOL.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.947
A LOT OF TATTOOS
THAT WERE EXECUTED,

33:11.030 --> 33:12.281
VERY POOR ANATOMY.

33:12.365 --> 33:13.908
LET'S JUST SAY, FOR EXAMPLE,
LIKE, ON ALLY'S TATTOO.

33:13.991 --> 33:16.119
LET'S SAY TENDONS TIE,
LIGAMENTS LINK.

33:16.202 --> 33:18.579
IT'S A LITTLE RHYME
IN THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.790
- BUT, MIKE, SHE AT LEAST
ATTEMPTED TO SHOW THOSE THINGS.

33:20.873 --> 33:22.333
- SHE DID IT.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.418
- IN THIS TATTOO, I DON'T THINK
THAT ANY OF THE LINE WORK

33:23.501 --> 33:27.213
OR THE SHADING SHOWS
A VERY CONCENTRATED EFFORT

33:27.296 --> 33:28.631
OF BEING EXACTLY PRECISE.

33:28.715 --> 33:29.716
THE SHADOW THAT SWIRLS AROUND
WITH IT,

33:29.799 --> 33:32.051
VERY SKETCHY AND UNEVEN,

33:32.135 --> 33:34.637
AND I THINK IT TAKES AWAY
FROM THE DESIGN A LITTLE BIT.

33:34.721 --> 33:37.432
- THERE'S NOTHING TO JUDGE,
SO TO SPEND SIX HOURS DOING THIS

33:37.515 --> 33:40.518
AND PUT YOUR LIVELIHOOD
IN THIS COMPETITION ON THE LINE,

33:40.601 --> 33:42.478
BAD IDEA.

33:45.732 --> 33:49.444
- THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.155
THE VERDICT WILL PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:52.238 --> 33:53.698
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

33:53.781 --> 33:56.117
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE'VE MADE A DECISION.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.377
- THAT WAS CRAZY.
- CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

34:06.461 --> 34:09.464
YOU GOT A LOT OF [bleep] BALLS

34:09.547 --> 34:13.009
TO GO UP THERE AND TO [bleep]
THROW ME UNDER THE BUS

34:13.092 --> 34:14.802
LIKE A [bleep] PUSSY.
- I DIDN'T THROW YOU--

34:14.886 --> 34:16.888
- SHUT YOUR [bleep] MOUTH,
MOTHER[bleep].

34:16.971 --> 34:18.556
{\an1}YOU DIDN'T DO A THING THAT ANY
ONE OF THESE PEOPLE [bleep] DID.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.806
- I'M STILL HERE.
I'M GONNA BE HERE

34:19.891 --> 34:20.975
FOR THE NEXT WEEK
AND THE WEEK AFTER, SO GOOD.

34:21.058 --> 34:23.143
- HEY, SHUT YOUR [bleep] MOUTH
WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU.

34:23.226 --> 34:25.103
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.065
- AND MAYBE YOU SHOULD
UNDERSTAND THE ANATOMY BOOK.

34:27.148 --> 34:27.482
- HEY, SHUT THE [bleep] UP
BEFORE I PUT MY [bleep] FOOT

34:27.565 --> 34:29.233
IN YOUR MOUTH.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.485
- WHERE WERE YOUR TENDONS?
WHERE WERE YOUR VEINS?

34:31.569 --> 34:32.652
- I'M NOT GONNA SAY
THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANATOMY.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.781
I UNDERSTAND IT MORE
THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN THIS ROOM.

34:34.864 --> 34:37.492
- THE HELL YOU SAY.
- MIKE, SHUT UP.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.911
- AT THIS POINT,
IT'S JUST RELENTLESS,

34:39.994 --> 34:41.746
AND I THINK IT'S JUST
OUT OF PURE JEALOUSY.

34:41.829 --> 34:43.246
{\an8}NOT TO STATE
THE PERFECTLY OBVIOUS,

34:43.331 --> 34:45.458
{\an8}BUT I'M ATTRACTIVE,
AND I HAVE INTELLIGENCE.

34:45.541 --> 34:47.126
- [bleep] DUMBASS, YO.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.713
- I LIKE HOW
I'M THE SMARTEST PERSON HERE,

34:50.797 --> 34:51.714
BUT YET YOU STILL REFER TO ME
AS A DUMBASS.

34:51.797 --> 34:53.090
- SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

34:53.174 --> 34:55.176
DON'T EVEN COME AT ME.
- YOU'RE STILL TALKING [bleep].

34:55.259 --> 34:57.595
YOU'RE STILL GONNA MAKE
A FOOL OF YOURSELF.

34:57.678 --> 34:58.554
I CAN'T WAIT TILL YOU
[bleep] UP SO BIG.

34:58.638 --> 35:00.181
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO IT TOO.
LOOK AT YOU.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.140
- I'LL [bleep] SPIT
RIGHT IN YOUR [bleep] FACE.

35:01.224 --> 35:03.392
- GO AHEAD.
COME ON, TAKE A [bleep] SWING.

35:03.476 --> 35:06.103
I WON'T HIT YOU BACK.
GO AHEAD, LET IT OUT.

35:06.187 --> 35:10.525
GO AHEAD.
WHAT YOU WAITING FOR?

35:10.608 --> 35:12.568
PENIS ENVY.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.821
- Y'ALL BETTER GET THIS [bleep]
RIGHT NOW.

35:14.904 --> 35:17.114
YOU BETTER GET--
GET THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.533
YOU'RE [bleep] NOTHING
BUT A BITCH.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.243
THAT'S ALL YOU ARE.
YOU'RE A [bleep] DUMB BITCH.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.839
- THIS WEEK'S CHALLENGE
WAS PRECISION.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.507
WE DID
ANATOMICAL TATTOOS,

35:34.590 --> 35:36.175
SAW SOME STUFF THAT LOOKED
REALLY ANATOMICALLY CORRECT.

35:36.259 --> 35:39.011
CRAIG'S WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE
OF PRECISION.

35:39.095 --> 35:42.431
- CRAIG BROUGHT
SUCH DYNAMIC DETAILS

35:42.515 --> 35:44.517
INTO THIS VERY SIMPLE MUSCLE.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.893
THAT'S WHAT
REALLY IMPRESSES ME.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.895
- THAT'S ONE OF THE TOPS TODAY
IN MY OPINION TOO.

35:47.979 --> 35:51.065
HE PAID ATTENTION TO
SMALL DETAILS AND GOT IT RIGHT.

35:51.148 --> 35:53.943
- MOVING ALONG, WE HAD JOEY,
WHO DID THE ANATOMICAL HEART.

35:54.026 --> 35:56.195
- THIS TATTOO IS SO DYNAMIC.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.406
THIS COULD BE THE BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

35:58.489 --> 35:59.574
- I THINK, FOR ME,
THE BOTTOM, MADDIE.

35:59.657 --> 36:00.491
- BINGO.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.994
- IT DIDN'T LOOK
ANATOMICALLY CORRECT.

36:03.077 --> 36:05.913
- HER LINE WORK WAS NOT PRECISE.
- MYSTICAL MIKE.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.582
- FOR HIM TO SIT HERE
AND ARGUE

36:07.665 --> 36:10.918
ABOUT TRYING TO SHOW MUSCLE
IN THIS IS ASININE.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.211
- MY LEAST FAVORITE TATTOO
OF THE DAY--

36:12.295 --> 36:16.549
CHRIS, WITH THE RIBS,
WHICH DIDN'T LOOK ANATOMICAL.

36:16.632 --> 36:19.218
- DO NOT BE SURPRISED
IF THE HUMAN CANVAS VOTE

36:19.302 --> 36:21.178
FOR THE BOTTOM
IS THIS ONE.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.890
- WE'RE HERE TO JUDGE ON
A SPECIFIC CRITERIA EACH WEEK.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.474
AND IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW
THAT CRITERIA,

36:25.558 --> 36:27.435
THEN YOU'RE [bleep] OUT.
- I THINK WE HAVE A DECISION.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.729
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

36:29.812 --> 36:32.607
{\an8}- WE'RE HERE TO SEE WHICH ONE
OF THESE TATTOOS IS THE WORST.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.900
{\an8}- WHO THINKS MYSTICAL MIKE HAD
THE WORST TATTOO?

36:33.983 --> 36:36.068
{\an8}THAT WAS THE MUSICAL NOTE.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.404
- EVERY TIME SOMEBODY
WALKS UP TO YOU,

36:38.487 --> 36:40.031
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO EXPLAIN
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

36:40.114 --> 36:42.783
- I DIDN'T WANT
ANYTHING GRUESOME.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.494
- IT LOOKS LIKE A RED TATTOO
WITH BLACK STRIPES IN IT.

36:45.578 --> 36:47.622
- HE DIDN'T DO WHAT THE
CHALLENGE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.457
- EVEN GIVEN THAT,
UP TO THIS POINT,

36:49.540 --> 36:51.626
I STILL HATE
THE CALF TATTOO MORE.

36:51.709 --> 36:54.170
- E.S. DID MY TATTOO.
HE DEFINITELY RUSHED.

36:54.253 --> 36:57.298
- TO ME, IT LOOKS LIKE
A SCREAMING VAGINA.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.883
[laughter]

36:58.966 --> 37:00.134
- PERSONALLY, I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH MY TATTOO.

37:00.217 --> 37:02.553
I JUST HOPE
ONE OF Y'ALL'S IS WORSE.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.138
- MY TATTOO ARTIST
WAS ALLY.

37:04.221 --> 37:06.599
THIS IS AN ANATOMICAL TATTOO
OF MY SHOULDER.

37:06.682 --> 37:08.392
- THE PINS HOLDING IT BACK,
YOU WOULD THINK

37:08.476 --> 37:10.394
THAT THEY WOULD BE ATTACHED
TO THE SKIN

37:10.478 --> 37:11.938
AND NOT HAVE THE SHADOWING
UNDERNEATH THEM,

37:12.021 --> 37:13.189
WHERE THEY'RE LIFTED UP.

37:13.272 --> 37:16.192
- IT'S DEFINITELY NOT ANATOMICAL
OR PRECISE AT ALL.

37:16.275 --> 37:18.110
- HAVE WE ALL COME
TO A CONSENSUS?

37:18.194 --> 37:20.237
- YES.
- YEAH, YEAH.

37:22.281 --> 37:23.824
[door shuts]

37:23.908 --> 37:25.785
- OH, MAN.
- HERE WE GO.

37:25.868 --> 37:26.619
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
WE NEED TO SEE

37:26.702 --> 37:30.248
CRAIG, CHRIS,

37:30.331 --> 37:33.834
MADDIE...

37:33.918 --> 37:35.169
AND MIKE.

37:35.252 --> 37:36.462
SEE Y'ALL AT THE SHOP.

37:36.545 --> 37:37.922
- SOMETHING'S
ABOUT TO GO DOWN.

37:38.005 --> 37:40.424
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
- GOOD LUCK.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.426
- BE STRONG, MADDIE.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.189
- TODAY, YOU NEEDED
THE PRECISION OF A SURGEON

37:55.272 --> 37:58.985
TO CREATE
REALISTIC ANATOMICAL TATTOOS.

37:59.068 --> 38:02.321
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED THAT
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY...

38:04.949 --> 38:08.452
GOES TO CRAIG.
- YES.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.997
- WE FELT LIKE
YOU DID THE BEST JOB.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.416
THE COLOR, HOW IT POPPED OUT,
ALL THE WAY TO THE DETAIL.

38:13.499 --> 38:16.711
- CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

38:16.794 --> 38:18.671
- MADDIE, CHRIS, AND MIKE,

38:18.754 --> 38:21.841
ALL THREE OF YOU
CAN JUSTIFIABLY BE SENT HOME.

38:21.924 --> 38:25.261
MIKE, YOU'RE HERE
BECAUSE THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

38:25.344 --> 38:29.932
VOTED THIS THE WORST TATTOO
OF THE DAY.

38:30.016 --> 38:32.727
THE CHALLENGE WAS PRECISION
ANATOMICAL TATTOOS.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.061
WE DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.396
- GIVE ME SOMETHING
ON MY PLAYING FIELD

38:35.479 --> 38:38.065
THAT I HAVE FAMILIARITY WITH.
- YOU LITERALLY TOLD US

38:38.149 --> 38:41.277
YOU HAVE A BETTER GRASP
ABOUT ANATOMY THAN ANYONE ELSE,

38:41.360 --> 38:42.319
AND YOU DECIDED
TO DO NONE OF IT.

38:42.403 --> 38:45.239
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHINE?
- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME

38:45.322 --> 38:46.741
TO KEEP MY SHOULDERS BACK
AND MY HEAD HIGH.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.242
WHETHER YOU KEEP ME HERE
OR SEND ME HOME,

38:48.326 --> 38:50.119
MY CONFIDENCE PREVAILS
REGARDLESS.

38:50.202 --> 38:50.870
- OKAY, BUT WHEN YOU LAY
YOUR HEAD ON YOUR PILLOW,

38:50.953 --> 38:53.873
DID YOU ACTUALLY DO A TATTOO

38:53.956 --> 38:55.916
THAT COULD FIGHT AS MUCH
AS YOUR MOUTH IS TRYING?

38:56.000 --> 39:00.212
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

39:00.296 --> 39:02.173
- MADDIE.
- WHAT YOUR PEERS DO

39:02.256 --> 39:04.550
HAS A MAJOR EFFECT
ON HOW HARSHLY YOU GET JUDGED.

39:04.633 --> 39:06.427
WHEN YOU LOOK AT
THE OTHER TATTOOS IN THE FIELD,

39:06.510 --> 39:08.471
THIS TATTOO,
IT'S JUST IN THE BOTTOM.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.556
- I'M THE YOUNG UN,
BUT I HAVE PASSION,

39:10.639 --> 39:12.475
AND I CAN LEARN
FROM CRITICISM.

39:12.558 --> 39:14.560
- THIS IS NOT GOOD TATTOOING.

39:14.643 --> 39:17.605
- CHRIS.

39:17.688 --> 39:19.648
- YOU DIDN'T SHOW US
ANATOMICAL,

39:19.732 --> 39:21.108
WHICH PUT YOU IN THE BOTTOM.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.027
- I WAS LISTENING TO YOU GUYS
THE OTHER DAY AND GOING,

39:23.110 --> 39:24.570
"I'M GONNA DO
EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAY."

39:24.653 --> 39:25.654
AND THEN I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE HELL IT WENT.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.114
- I'M NOT A TATTOO ARTIST.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.950
I PLAY FOOTBALL,
AND IT RELATES IN THE SAME WAY.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.328
WHEN THEY TELLING YOU
WHAT WE WANT TO SEE,

39:32.411 --> 39:33.704
IF YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION
TO THAT,

39:33.788 --> 39:35.456
YOU GONNA GET
WHAT YOU DID TODAY.

39:35.539 --> 39:38.375
- I UNDERSTAND, BUT OF US,
WHO'S GONNA TURN IT AROUND?

39:38.459 --> 39:40.503
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS KID
OVER HERE HAS A [bleep] CLUE.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.963
- POINT BEING, IF YOU DON'T
DO WHAT YOU'RE ASKED FOR,

39:43.047 --> 39:46.967
YOU'LL GO HOME FOR IT.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.470
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

MIKE...

39:56.477 --> 40:00.856
YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

40:00.940 --> 40:01.816
- AT THE END OF THE DAY,
ARE YOU GIVING US

40:01.899 --> 40:04.485
ANY OPTION TO BE LIKE,
"THIS GUY DOES KNOW

40:04.568 --> 40:05.611
HOW TO DO A BLACK OUTLINE,"

40:05.694 --> 40:07.988
OR, "THIS GUY DOES KNOW
WHERE TO PUT SHADING"?

40:08.072 --> 40:10.199
NO.

40:10.282 --> 40:13.077
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.122
- I SHOULD STILL BE
IN THIS COMPETITION

40:16.205 --> 40:17.498
BECAUSE I KNOW I CAN CREATE
BEAUTIFUL TATTOOS.

40:17.581 --> 40:20.543
I'M A GREAT ARTIST,
AND THIS IS [bleep] BULL[bleep].

40:25.339 --> 40:28.926

40:30.553 --> 40:34.098
ONE OF YOU
WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

40:34.181 --> 40:35.349
- [bleep] MY LIFE.

40:35.432 --> 40:36.475
- I GOT TO POINT A GUN
TO A PERSON'S HEAD

40:36.559 --> 40:39.603
AND SHOOT 'EM IN THE HEAD.
- OH, KISS MY ASS.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.397
- I'M GONNA PISS
SO MANY PEOPLE OFF.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.357
- YOU REALIZE YOU'RE PUTTING
A TATTOO ON A PERSON.

40:43.440 --> 40:43.774
- I'VE NEVER HAD A CLIENT
DO THIS TO ME BEFORE.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.860
- DO WHAT?

40:45.943 --> 40:46.944
- I'VE NEVER HAD A CLIENT
PICK AT ME.

40:47.027 --> 40:48.028
[bleep] IT,
I'LL TATTOO MYSELF!

40:48.112 --> 40:50.698
- THERE'S NO PART OF THIS TATTOO
THAT'S NOT JACKED.

40:50.781 --> 40:53.159
- THE QUALITY IS TOTALLY,
TOTALLY OFF.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.411
YOU DROPPED THE BALL
ON THIS ONE BAD.
