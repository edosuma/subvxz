WEBVTT

00:08.175 --> 00:09.909
Someone's alive in here.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.539
You just can't help yourself, can you?

00:11.539 --> 00:12.665
Saving everyone.

00:12.699 --> 00:14.775
You want me to go and tell my CO

00:14.809 --> 00:16.143
to hail a UNN admiral

00:16.177 --> 00:17.644
in the middle of a war?

00:17.679 --> 00:18.779
Yes, exactly.

00:18.813 --> 00:19.980
So what is this thing

00:20.014 --> 00:21.348
that you want me to show them?

00:21.382 --> 00:23.784
Time is short, and I'll be brief.

00:23.818 --> 00:24.985
Are the prisoners secured?

00:25.019 --> 00:26.553
We have them in the med bay.

00:26.587 --> 00:28.488
What really happened on that ship?

00:28.523 --> 00:30.891
This war was built on a lie.

00:30.925 --> 00:32.558
Are you going to do something about it?

00:32.593 --> 00:33.961
I'm relieving you of command.

00:33.995 --> 00:35.562
The "Agatha King" is now mine.

00:35.596 --> 00:37.965
Melas has learned to live
without a father.

00:37.999 --> 00:40.000
We don't need you anymore.

00:40.034 --> 00:41.368
Fire!

00:41.402 --> 00:44.137
You guys fought one of
those things and won?

00:44.172 --> 00:47.107
All hybrid pods are ready for transfer.

00:48.443 --> 00:49.309
Whoa!

00:49.344 --> 00:50.377
Katoa, come on!

00:50.411 --> 00:52.012
I want to talk to Katoa.

00:52.046 --> 00:54.314
Disassembly reveals useful pathways.

00:54.349 --> 00:56.750
The boy is talking to the rest of

00:56.784 --> 00:58.218
the Protomolecule infestations.

00:58.252 --> 01:03.991
He's the key to everything.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

02:11.406 --> 02:13.093
It's getting kinda crowded out here.

02:13.127 --> 02:14.561
Yeah.

02:14.595 --> 02:17.798
When the MCRN started
hauling ass back from Saturn,

02:17.832 --> 02:20.434
the UNN sent the bulk of their
Outer Planet assets

02:20.468 --> 02:21.935
burning hard towards 'em.

02:21.969 --> 02:23.293
Now,

02:24.138 --> 02:26.273
they're all headed towards Callisto,

02:26.307 --> 02:27.741
transponders going dark.

02:27.775 --> 02:29.242
The MCRN shipyard.

02:29.277 --> 02:30.811
It's a critical base of operations.

02:30.845 --> 02:31.912
That it is,

02:31.946 --> 02:33.747
but it has opened up

02:33.781 --> 02:36.298
a hole for us right here.

02:36.333 --> 02:37.417
See this course?

02:37.452 --> 02:38.852
This'll get us to Io without anyone

02:38.886 --> 02:40.253
picking up our scent.

02:40.288 --> 02:41.755
Little bit of luck, we'll get in and out

02:41.789 --> 02:43.423
without anyone noticing.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.625
Whoever is there won't know we're coming,

02:45.660 --> 02:48.328
but that's the only advantage we got.

02:48.362 --> 02:50.030
We'll go in hot, land hard,

02:50.064 --> 02:51.364
and from there, it's a 100-meter run

02:51.399 --> 02:52.699
to the access hatch.

02:52.733 --> 02:54.668
Any idea of the resistance inside?

02:54.702 --> 02:57.137
In terms of humans? No.

02:57.171 --> 02:58.538
In terms of hybrids,

02:58.573 --> 03:00.941
there's no way to know for sure.

03:00.975 --> 03:03.009
We haven't had any more
Protomolecule shouts

03:03.044 --> 03:04.778
from the station.

03:04.812 --> 03:08.148
It's possible the hybrids
are either gone or dormant.

03:08.182 --> 03:10.257
And if they're not?

03:11.152 --> 03:12.619
Then we run,

03:12.653 --> 03:15.822
and nuke the goddamn place
on the way out.

03:36.777 --> 03:39.012
Copy that.

03:39.046 --> 03:40.313
Okay.

03:48.089 --> 03:49.890
Ready?

03:54.629 --> 03:56.997
If they take Callisto, it's game over.

03:57.031 --> 03:58.498
They've got 19 destroyers.

03:58.533 --> 04:00.901
Third fleet hurt 'em good.

04:00.935 --> 04:04.037
And lost four battle groups
in the process.

04:04.071 --> 04:06.521
Your sister fought a good fight.

04:08.042 --> 04:09.709
With those reinforcements,

04:09.744 --> 04:12.345
it'll be 51 destroyers against our 23.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.614
We're racing into a battle
before our guns arrive.

04:14.649 --> 04:16.983
Sir, Ensign Sinopoli, as you requested.

04:17.017 --> 04:18.285
Thank you, Chief.

04:18.319 --> 04:19.386
Captain, on behalf of my team,

04:19.420 --> 04:21.154
I'd just like to say thank you.

04:21.189 --> 04:23.123
Thank you, sailor,
for coming back to the fight,

04:23.157 --> 04:25.125
though I don't understand how you did it.

04:25.159 --> 04:27.194
Your command deck was sheared clean off.

04:27.228 --> 04:29.296
We didn't exactly get the "K.C."

04:29.330 --> 04:30.797
in ship-shape ourselves.

04:30.831 --> 04:32.072
We had help.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.633
From who?

04:33.668 --> 04:34.868
James Holden.

04:34.902 --> 04:36.303
The Taker

04:36.337 --> 04:37.904
who blamed us for blowing up
the "Canterbury,"

04:37.939 --> 04:38.905
then got the "Donnie" killed?

04:38.940 --> 04:40.574
The "Rocinante"...

04:41.058 --> 04:43.359
I mean, the "Tachi"...
it came upon the "K.C."

04:43.394 --> 04:45.628
They just fixed up your boat
and sent you on your way?

04:45.663 --> 04:47.463
We tried to take the ship by force,

04:47.498 --> 04:48.831
but we were unsuccessful.

04:48.866 --> 04:50.199
There was a Martian marine on board,

04:50.234 --> 04:51.968
Gunnery Sergeant Roberta Draper.

04:52.002 --> 04:53.052
The defector.

04:53.087 --> 04:55.772
As well as a UN deputy undersecretary,

04:55.806 --> 04:58.407
Chrisjen Avasarala. She was there, too.

04:59.043 --> 05:01.177
Who else was there? Fucking tooth fairy?

05:01.211 --> 05:03.179
It's a little hard to believe, son.

05:03.213 --> 05:04.647
But she was there.

05:04.682 --> 05:06.516
Then why did they let you go?

05:08.252 --> 05:10.987
Holden and Avasarala gave me
this to give to my CO.

05:11.021 --> 05:12.755
They say there's a... a conspiracy

05:12.790 --> 05:16.759
within the UN, and this is the proof.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.928
Time is short, and I'll be brief.

05:18.962 --> 05:20.930
Martian Defense Minister Korshunov

05:20.964 --> 05:23.599
suffered a fatal heart attack
earlier this evening.

05:23.634 --> 05:27.170
Simultaneously, the MCRN "Karakum,"

05:27.204 --> 05:29.072
dispatched by Korshunov to take delivery

05:29.106 --> 05:31.040
of your Protomolecule technology,

05:31.075 --> 05:33.743
was destroyed over Ganymede.

05:33.777 --> 05:35.912
And I gave the order.

05:35.946 --> 05:37.714
Avasarala wanted this to get to you

05:37.748 --> 05:39.156
and Admiral Souther.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.584
He's commander of their Jupiter fleet,

05:41.618 --> 05:42.852
aboard the "Agatha King."

05:42.886 --> 05:44.220
She says he's an honorable man.

05:44.254 --> 05:45.855
He wouldn't fight an illegitimate war.

05:45.889 --> 05:47.690
He's been fighting one,

05:47.725 --> 05:48.880
and based on the number of our ships

05:48.914 --> 05:49.820
he's knocked out,

05:49.854 --> 05:51.194
he's pretty good at it, too.

05:51.228 --> 05:53.029
You don't even know if that's authentic.

05:53.063 --> 05:54.464
This smells like counterespionage,

05:54.498 --> 05:56.298
some kind of smokescreen.

05:57.801 --> 06:00.903
Nav, where's the UNN "Agatha King"?

06:00.938 --> 06:03.239
Sir, according to our last
drive sig scan,

06:03.273 --> 06:05.942
the "Agatha King" was en route
to the Jovian system.

06:05.976 --> 06:07.043
Callisto?

06:07.077 --> 06:08.144
No, sir.

06:08.178 --> 06:10.228
Looks like they're heading for Io.

06:11.315 --> 06:13.382
There's nothing on Io but volcanoes,

06:13.417 --> 06:15.218
bad weather, and stink.

06:15.252 --> 06:17.220
And maybe something we don't know about.

06:17.254 --> 06:20.156
Something important enough
to divert a UNN flagship

06:20.190 --> 06:21.624
in a war zone.

06:21.658 --> 06:23.126
I'm sorry, Captain,

06:23.160 --> 06:25.928
shouldn't we at least try
to contact Souther?

06:25.963 --> 06:28.331
An enemy admiral in the middle of a war

06:28.365 --> 06:30.633
to pass along a message
we don't know is real,

06:30.667 --> 06:33.210
for a purpose we don't understand?

06:34.438 --> 06:36.606
Tight-beam MCRN Command.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.908
Inform them that we have received intel

06:38.942 --> 06:41.811
that the UNN "Agatha King"
is en route to Io

06:41.845 --> 06:43.846
for an unknown objective

06:43.881 --> 06:45.848
that may be critical to the war effort,

06:45.883 --> 06:48.851
and we are changing course to intercept.

06:48.886 --> 06:51.754
If necessary, we will engage

06:51.789 --> 06:53.589
and take them out.

06:53.624 --> 06:54.824
Aye-aye, sir.

06:54.858 --> 06:55.925
- Captain...
- You've done your part,

06:55.959 --> 06:57.860
Ensign. Chief!

06:57.895 --> 06:59.762
Get him on a damage control unit.

06:59.797 --> 07:01.264
We're gonna need the help.

07:01.298 --> 07:03.699
One way or another,
we're heading for a fight.

07:03.734 --> 07:05.501
Aye, sir.

07:15.078 --> 07:17.046
Their battle group
was en route to Callisto

07:17.080 --> 07:20.016
when this cruiser detached
and set course for Io.

07:20.050 --> 07:21.951
Drive sig indicates Sirocco-class.

07:21.985 --> 07:23.820
We can handle one of those.

07:23.854 --> 07:25.454
I'd still hate to have to slug it out.

07:25.489 --> 07:26.956
They could do us some real damage.

07:26.990 --> 07:28.791
My recommendation would be
to fall back to Callisto

07:28.826 --> 07:30.059
and rendezvous with the Eighth
so the numbers

07:30.093 --> 07:31.661
- are in our favor.
- We will continue to Io

07:31.695 --> 07:33.061
as planned.

07:34.164 --> 07:35.464
Admiral,

07:35.499 --> 07:37.732
may I ask why we're going to Io?

07:38.502 --> 07:40.336
You don't need to know.

07:41.772 --> 07:42.972
Of course, sir,

07:43.006 --> 07:44.807
but I wonder, since Callisto

07:44.842 --> 07:46.843
- is the key to victory...
- We are going to Io.

07:46.877 --> 07:49.244
The rest of the fleet will meet us there.

07:50.247 --> 07:51.814
Sir.

07:51.849 --> 07:53.182
Mars knows where we're going.

07:53.217 --> 07:55.041
That's where the battle will be fought.

07:56.119 --> 07:57.720
Mr. Boyer, relay my orders to the fleet.

07:57.754 --> 07:59.755
Aye-aye, sir.

07:59.790 --> 08:01.858
Admiral, in the future, unless you have

08:01.892 --> 08:04.160
specific business on the CIC,

08:04.194 --> 08:06.262
there's no need for you to be here.

08:08.699 --> 08:10.399
Understood, sir.

08:21.545 --> 08:23.862
Good coffee can save the world.

08:24.381 --> 08:27.283
I'd settle for it saving my morning.

08:27.317 --> 08:31.387
My father used to keep a
statue of Atlas on his desk.

08:31.421 --> 08:33.722
He told me I had even stronger shoulders

08:33.756 --> 08:34.857
than him.

08:34.892 --> 08:36.457
I was six.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.195
Let me guess. It's still on your desk

08:39.229 --> 08:41.864
- to inspire you every day.
- No.

08:41.899 --> 08:44.934
I smashed it when my son was killed.

08:46.670 --> 08:49.038
The point is, I didn't quit.

08:49.072 --> 08:52.375
I realized there were
very few adults in the room,

08:52.409 --> 08:53.576
and that, like it or not,

08:53.610 --> 08:55.185
I was one of them.

08:55.779 --> 08:58.047
I think I see where this is going.

08:58.081 --> 09:00.549
Jules-Pierre Mao
has been letting the children

09:00.584 --> 09:02.251
play war in the backyard

09:02.286 --> 09:04.754
while he sorts out what god or monster

09:04.788 --> 09:06.289
looms over the fence.

09:06.323 --> 09:08.491
Then he came up with a real shitty plan.

09:08.525 --> 09:11.928
Kids can burn down the house
as easy as you or me.

09:13.196 --> 09:14.897
James.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.403
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

09:20.437 --> 09:22.338
You can't nuke Io.

09:22.372 --> 09:24.756
I need the Protomolecule.

09:29.646 --> 09:31.080
Naomi was right.

09:31.114 --> 09:33.306
She's a very clever girl.

09:33.817 --> 09:36.085
Earth doesn't have a sample,

09:36.119 --> 09:38.120
but I don't want it as a weapon.

09:38.155 --> 09:40.089
You know what's happening on Venus.

09:40.123 --> 09:41.958
The entire system's at risk.

09:41.992 --> 09:44.994
Because of adults like you.

09:45.028 --> 09:47.863
You're the reason we're in this mess.

09:47.898 --> 09:50.099
My favorite saying used to be

09:50.133 --> 09:52.034
"Earth must come first."

09:52.069 --> 09:54.270
I did terrible things

09:54.304 --> 09:55.671
to protect my home,

09:55.706 --> 09:57.373
but this moment is different.

09:57.407 --> 10:00.500
This is about
the survival of our species.

10:01.178 --> 10:03.946
I tried saving the world.

10:03.981 --> 10:06.015
All I did was make it worse.

10:06.049 --> 10:07.674
But at least you tried.

10:08.251 --> 10:10.820
And you cannot stop trying now,

10:10.854 --> 10:13.622
'cause I need to understand
the Protomolecule,

10:13.657 --> 10:16.158
and for that, I need a sample.

10:16.193 --> 10:20.396
For the good of Earth, Mars,
and the Belt.

10:20.430 --> 10:22.598
For the good of us all.

10:24.835 --> 10:26.359
You're not a child.

10:27.838 --> 10:30.673
I suspect you never were.

10:30.707 --> 10:33.042
So stop acting like one.

10:34.878 --> 10:36.846
It doesn't become you.

10:47.173 --> 10:48.640
Hey, Holden.

10:48.674 --> 10:49.908
What's up?

10:49.942 --> 10:51.142
I'm gonna open up the comms

10:51.177 --> 10:53.645
and have one last little looky-loo

10:53.679 --> 10:56.481
before we go dark,
if that's all right with you.

10:56.515 --> 10:59.317
Okay, make it quick.

11:00.553 --> 11:01.619
All right.

11:02.555 --> 11:05.156
Let's see what we got here, girl.

11:07.860 --> 11:10.161
Yeah. Definitely looks like
the next rodeo's

11:10.196 --> 11:11.529
gonna be at Callisto.

11:11.564 --> 11:13.698
That's good.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.221
Hi, Dad.

11:37.056 --> 11:38.390
I know Mom's mad,

11:38.424 --> 11:39.958
and doesn't want me talking to you,

11:39.992 --> 11:42.060
but I just wanted you to know

11:42.094 --> 11:43.061
I'm not mad.

11:43.095 --> 11:44.262
I mean,

11:44.296 --> 11:45.697
I was at first,

11:45.731 --> 11:47.866
but I know you only left to protect us.

11:47.900 --> 11:51.361
A real warrior has to make sacrifices.

11:51.804 --> 11:53.271
When I'm old enough,

11:53.305 --> 11:55.473
I'm gonna join you
and fight for Mars, too.

11:55.508 --> 11:57.475
- Oh, jeez.
- Anyhow,

11:57.510 --> 11:59.878
I just wanted to tell you.

11:59.912 --> 12:02.247
I'm proud to be your son.

12:03.249 --> 12:04.315
Bye, Dad.

12:04.350 --> 12:06.718
Hope you can come home soon.

12:19.765 --> 12:21.349
Just breathe.

12:22.101 --> 12:24.436
Squeeze the trigger. Don't pull it.

12:29.108 --> 12:31.409
Not bad, doc.

12:33.446 --> 12:34.746
Just remember, when we're on Io,

12:34.780 --> 12:36.014
the real bullets kick a lot harder

12:36.048 --> 12:37.615
than these plastic rounds.

12:37.650 --> 12:39.584
I'll remember.

12:39.618 --> 12:42.353
Thank you for taking care of me

12:42.388 --> 12:44.556
and for teaching me.

12:45.991 --> 12:48.593
You can thank me if
we get your little girl back.

12:50.129 --> 12:51.596
Or get even.

12:53.032 --> 12:55.533
Like you said, it's the next best thing.

13:18.357 --> 13:20.859
Permission to speak freely, sir.

13:20.893 --> 13:22.619
Please do.

13:23.662 --> 13:25.230
Ever since Nguyen came on board,

13:25.264 --> 13:26.831
he's been tight-beaming back and forth

13:26.866 --> 13:28.700
between the UN and Io,

13:28.734 --> 13:31.636
and everything's off-buffer,
against regs,

13:31.670 --> 13:33.304
with no record of the conversations.

13:33.339 --> 13:34.973
You've been monitoring his comms.

13:35.007 --> 13:36.307
Yep.

13:36.342 --> 13:37.842
And now he's diverted a capital ship

13:37.877 --> 13:39.043
from a major engagement

13:39.078 --> 13:40.812
to go to a deserted moon,

13:40.846 --> 13:41.880
keeping you in the dark

13:41.914 --> 13:42.981
and relieving you of command

13:43.015 --> 13:44.148
for no fucking reason.

13:44.183 --> 13:45.517
Something is off.

13:45.551 --> 13:47.352
We've been talking,

13:47.386 --> 13:49.654
quietly, to some of the other ships.

13:49.688 --> 13:53.358
The commanders you trained,
they're loyal to you.

13:56.395 --> 13:58.363
If you were to make a move...

13:59.965 --> 14:01.666
A move?

14:01.700 --> 14:03.735
You know what we mean, sir.

14:03.769 --> 14:05.244
Yeah.

14:05.938 --> 14:07.672
And that's what worries me.

14:12.945 --> 14:14.946
Admiral.

14:21.787 --> 14:24.188
Oh, Boyer, um,
I've been meaning to tell you,

14:24.223 --> 14:26.024
your boss is kind of a prick.

14:26.058 --> 14:27.525
When he has to be.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.694
He doesn't like people
questioning his judgment.

14:29.728 --> 14:31.229
There's a reason he's Fleet Commander.

14:31.263 --> 14:32.697
Yeah, 'cause Souther stepped down.

14:32.731 --> 14:34.432
Are you sure it wasn't more
like stepped on?

14:34.466 --> 14:38.202
Well, Nguyen certainly has
the right qualifications:

14:38.237 --> 14:40.605
the ability to kiss Errinwright's ass.

14:41.674 --> 14:43.041
Did you know that Admiral Nguyen

14:43.075 --> 14:44.142
was in the Vesta Blockade?

14:44.176 --> 14:45.643
So were half the Joint Chiefs.

14:45.678 --> 14:48.212
He was on the "Yasijuro."

14:50.783 --> 14:52.208
No kidding.

14:53.352 --> 14:56.054
The "Yasi," with four other destroyers,

14:56.088 --> 14:59.090
were facing off against
one Martian cruiser.

14:59.124 --> 15:00.391
Somebody twitched.

15:00.426 --> 15:02.260
Everybody started shooting.

15:02.928 --> 15:05.263
Ceasefire was issued within minutes,

15:05.297 --> 15:07.432
but by then,

15:07.466 --> 15:08.900
that one Duster

15:08.934 --> 15:11.836
had crippled all five of our ships.

15:11.870 --> 15:16.741
Nguyen saw 29 fellow sailors
get blown out into space.

15:16.775 --> 15:18.343
You don't think he thinks about that

15:18.377 --> 15:20.912
every time he sees a Martian flag?

15:20.946 --> 15:22.480
Hm?

15:23.949 --> 15:25.658
He knows the enemy.

15:26.485 --> 15:29.153
I'm glad he's in charge
at a time like this.

15:36.228 --> 15:37.929
Well, Gunny...

15:39.531 --> 15:41.265
Looks like your Goliath's
gonna be all charged up

15:41.300 --> 15:42.700
in no time.

15:42.735 --> 15:45.036
Thrusters are low.
This won't refill them.

15:45.070 --> 15:48.773
Yeah, sorry about that.
We don't carry hydrazine.

15:48.807 --> 15:50.942
"Roci" has no need for rocket fuel,

15:50.976 --> 15:52.610
ironically.

15:52.645 --> 15:54.178
Look, don't worry about it.

15:54.213 --> 15:56.447
Like, Io's gonna be what, uh, 1/6 G?

15:56.482 --> 15:58.775
You and you crew killed a hybrid, yeah?

15:59.918 --> 16:01.786
Oh. Yeah.

16:01.820 --> 16:02.987
Barely.

16:03.022 --> 16:04.288
Well, how'd you do it?

16:04.323 --> 16:05.723
Tactically?

16:05.758 --> 16:06.624
We were lucky.

16:06.659 --> 16:09.193
They're not that smart.

16:09.228 --> 16:10.461
More like an animal,

16:10.496 --> 16:11.896
following instinct.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.999
We lured the thing out
with, um, a nuclear warhead,

16:15.034 --> 16:16.668
and I flipped the "Roci" around

16:16.702 --> 16:19.470
and I torched that thing
in my drive plume.

16:19.505 --> 16:21.205
I need incendiaries,

16:21.240 --> 16:23.257
or high explosives.

16:26.912 --> 16:28.312
But there's nothing here
that'll work with

16:28.347 --> 16:29.981
my RPGs, damn it!

16:34.853 --> 16:36.654
But these'll work with my gun.

16:36.689 --> 16:38.823
If I can get close enough
and maintain fire long enough,

16:38.857 --> 16:40.191
- these might do the trick.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

16:40.225 --> 16:41.492
hold on there, soldier.

16:41.527 --> 16:42.827
The plan is, if you guys see

16:42.861 --> 16:44.595
any of those things down there, you run.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.364
I know the plan.

16:58.444 --> 17:00.111
Katoa,

17:00.145 --> 17:01.879
can you hear me?

17:05.818 --> 17:08.685
What happened to me?

17:08.721 --> 17:10.288
It hurts.

17:10.321 --> 17:13.023
I'm sorry.

17:13.058 --> 17:14.858
I truly am.

17:19.064 --> 17:22.467
I want to talk to you about disassembly.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.435
What you said before,

17:24.470 --> 17:27.637
when you were... studying that man,

17:27.673 --> 17:29.974
were you also talking about
the "Arboghast,"

17:30.008 --> 17:31.492
on Venus?

17:32.244 --> 17:34.278
I think so.

17:34.313 --> 17:37.081
You also said "repurposing."

17:37.116 --> 17:38.950
What did you mean by that?

17:38.984 --> 17:40.384
You...

17:40.419 --> 17:42.120
You...

17:42.154 --> 17:43.321
You...

17:43.355 --> 17:44.922
You make it

17:44.957 --> 17:46.891
and it works,

17:46.925 --> 17:48.326
or it doesn't.

17:50.095 --> 17:51.462
And then...

17:51.497 --> 17:53.397
the parts...

17:53.432 --> 17:55.566
all the parts...

17:55.601 --> 17:57.835
put together,

17:57.870 --> 17:59.103
they...

17:59.138 --> 18:01.139
they...

18:01.173 --> 18:02.573
We need to...

18:02.608 --> 18:04.242
To know what you're trying to do.

18:04.276 --> 18:06.277
What do you want?

18:08.113 --> 18:09.947
If this can use,

18:09.982 --> 18:11.616
then use,

18:11.650 --> 18:14.352
not use, then...

18:14.386 --> 18:15.353
it turns.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.455
Can use? Not use?

18:17.489 --> 18:19.290
Use for what?

18:20.192 --> 18:22.160
Find the pieces

18:22.194 --> 18:23.427
for Up.

18:23.462 --> 18:25.263
Building...

18:25.297 --> 18:26.964
across...

18:26.999 --> 18:28.599
the Up...

18:28.634 --> 18:30.551
for the Work.

18:31.470 --> 18:32.503
The Work?

18:32.538 --> 18:34.005
What is the Work?

18:38.343 --> 18:40.878
You can't stop the Work!

18:42.047 --> 18:43.447
What are you building?

18:44.650 --> 18:46.117
He's changing too fast.

18:46.151 --> 18:47.485
We're losing him.

18:47.519 --> 18:48.986
Can you slow it down?

18:49.021 --> 18:50.822
Yeah, I can try.

18:51.857 --> 18:54.625
The control module used to
program the Hybrids

18:54.660 --> 18:56.127
is attached directly to the brain stem.

18:56.161 --> 18:57.395
I might be able to use it

18:57.429 --> 18:59.330
to slow his metabolism.

19:19.184 --> 19:20.893
There we go.

19:21.753 --> 19:23.221
See?

19:23.255 --> 19:25.523
It's all under control now.

19:32.332 --> 19:34.333
The "Hammurabi's" closing in fast.

19:34.367 --> 19:35.701
By the time we get to Io,

19:35.735 --> 19:37.136
they'll nearly have us
within missile lock.

19:37.170 --> 19:38.671
They won't engage until
the rest of the fleet

19:38.705 --> 19:40.506
gets to missile range, too.

19:40.540 --> 19:41.840
XO,

19:41.875 --> 19:43.475
cut our braking burn to Io 10%

19:43.510 --> 19:45.878
and inform me when we're ready
to make orbit.

19:45.912 --> 19:48.212
- I'll be in my quarters.
- Aye, sir.

19:53.687 --> 19:55.654
It's obviously a malfunction, Ensign.

19:55.689 --> 19:57.923
- But sir, it's...
- It's an old ship.

19:57.958 --> 20:00.659
Take a break. I'll handle it.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.834
What's up?

20:08.868 --> 20:11.403
Nothing. Comm panel's acting up again.

20:13.106 --> 20:14.840
We just got a message

20:14.874 --> 20:15.874
on the inter-fleet channel.

20:15.909 --> 20:17.576
We're at war.

20:17.611 --> 20:19.011
Who the hell would be using that?

20:19.045 --> 20:20.512
It's from the "Hammurabi."

20:20.547 --> 20:22.848
And it's addressed specifically
to Admiral Souther.

20:27.053 --> 20:28.687
Forward it to my personal comm

20:28.722 --> 20:30.856
and erase the log.

20:30.890 --> 20:33.459
Thank you, Mr. Mancuso. You have the con.

20:45.405 --> 20:47.273
So Jules,

20:47.307 --> 20:49.775
you will clean up the mess
you've made for me,

20:49.809 --> 20:52.745
you will return to Earth alone

20:52.779 --> 20:55.214
will await my instructions...

20:55.248 --> 20:57.750
and you will get the fuck back to work.

20:59.486 --> 21:01.787
What are you gonna do, sir?

21:01.821 --> 21:03.222
I need to confirm this is real.

21:03.256 --> 21:05.057
Nguyen is Errinwright's creature.

21:05.091 --> 21:07.993
- They're in this together.
- I need to confirm it first.

21:08.028 --> 21:10.763
What do you want me to do, sir?

21:13.466 --> 21:15.434
Be ready for anything.

21:28.281 --> 21:30.482
Sorry, sir. No one's allowed.

21:30.517 --> 21:32.785
Get the fuck out of my way, sailor.

21:39.192 --> 21:41.126
Ah.

21:41.161 --> 21:43.762
I was wondering when visiting hours were.

21:43.797 --> 21:45.831
Tell me exactly what Errinwright said

21:45.865 --> 21:48.300
in that message you claim
he sent to Avasarala?

21:56.810 --> 21:58.844
He said that, uh,

21:58.878 --> 22:01.547
he was working with Jules-Pierre Mao

22:01.581 --> 22:04.348
on a secret weapons program,

22:05.218 --> 22:07.953
that he was furious Mao was
in bed with the Martians.

22:07.987 --> 22:09.788
That's what he accused her of.

22:09.823 --> 22:11.056
He said he ordered the destruction

22:11.091 --> 22:12.524
of a Martian ship that was supposed to

22:12.559 --> 22:14.660
pick up a weapon on Ganymede.

22:14.694 --> 22:16.795
What ship?

22:16.830 --> 22:18.597
The, uh...

22:20.667 --> 22:22.491
"Karakum."

22:23.002 --> 22:25.003
That was it.

22:27.874 --> 22:31.110
Avasarala sent you the comms buffer.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.648
Yeah, she made it.

22:37.884 --> 22:40.586
- How is she...
- Admiral Souther.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.221
Please come with us.

22:42.255 --> 22:44.323
Admiral Nguyen would like to see you,

22:44.357 --> 22:46.325
now.

23:15.388 --> 23:17.022
Alex says it looks like there might be

23:17.056 --> 23:19.358
a ship or two heading towards Io.

23:20.894 --> 23:23.429
We still have a clear path?

23:23.463 --> 23:25.864
He thinks he can keep Io
between us and them

23:25.899 --> 23:27.306
for the descent.

23:28.001 --> 23:30.035
He's earning his pay.

23:30.069 --> 23:33.071
Of course, we all basically
work for food.

23:38.845 --> 23:40.412
Jim.

23:42.315 --> 23:45.083
I know you feel like I betrayed you.

23:47.368 --> 23:49.288
It doesn't matter what I feel.

23:49.322 --> 23:51.290
It does.

23:51.324 --> 23:52.958
It's almost funny to say this

23:52.992 --> 23:55.894
after everything
we've been through, but...

23:55.929 --> 23:57.896
you don't really know me,

23:57.931 --> 23:59.965
and that's not your fault.

23:59.999 --> 24:01.882
You did what you did,

24:02.969 --> 24:04.736
and if you hadn't,

24:04.771 --> 24:06.071
Mars would be the only one

24:06.105 --> 24:07.840
with the Protomolecule.

24:07.874 --> 24:11.076
You were right about Avasarala.

24:11.110 --> 24:13.435
Earth doesn't have a sample.

24:14.647 --> 24:16.448
What's done is done.

24:19.619 --> 24:22.421
But I want you to understand
why I did it.

24:27.060 --> 24:30.662
You know, I used to run with the OPA.

24:30.697 --> 24:32.498
I was with someone.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.368
He was a romantic,

24:36.402 --> 24:38.604
an idealist.

24:38.638 --> 24:41.006
A fighter.

24:41.040 --> 24:44.977
He always believed
what he was doing was right.

24:46.980 --> 24:49.114
You know I'm not that guy.

24:56.756 --> 24:58.490
I had a child with him.

25:01.661 --> 25:03.629
A baby boy.

25:05.665 --> 25:07.165
Filip.

25:11.204 --> 25:13.829
The man I loved took him away

25:14.872 --> 25:18.510
because I refused to do what he wanted.

25:21.180 --> 25:23.348
I was desperate.

25:24.784 --> 25:26.351
Wrecked.

25:28.788 --> 25:31.757
And then finally,

25:31.791 --> 25:33.599
I shut it all off.

25:34.460 --> 25:37.728
And I signed up to
the "Canterbury" to disappear.

25:38.631 --> 25:40.566
Naomi, I'm sorry.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.768
Why didn't you tell me?

25:42.802 --> 25:44.736
I don't know.

25:44.771 --> 25:47.739
I just... couldn't.

25:50.710 --> 25:53.545
But then Eros happened,

25:53.580 --> 25:55.414
and Ganymede.

25:55.448 --> 25:58.183
Seeing all those Belters suffering.

25:59.652 --> 26:01.920
And you cared so much.

26:04.290 --> 26:07.259
It made it hard to stay numb.

26:10.163 --> 26:12.531
I imagined Filip amongst them.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.734
It woke me up.

26:19.405 --> 26:22.507
I'm not sorry I gave
the Protomolecule to the Belt.

26:23.610 --> 26:26.445
But I'm sorry for the way that I did it.

26:28.448 --> 26:30.549
I should've talked to you first,

26:30.583 --> 26:32.199
all of you,

26:33.419 --> 26:35.787
but most of all, you.

26:42.495 --> 26:45.197
I'm never going to like what you did.

26:46.966 --> 26:49.568
But I can't hate you

26:49.602 --> 26:52.270
for doing what you thought was right.

27:10.694 --> 27:13.147
The control module will
deliver a minimal level

27:13.173 --> 27:16.275
of stimulation,
just enough for awareness.

27:18.364 --> 27:19.831
Katoa.

27:21.595 --> 27:24.663
You were telling us about the Work.

27:24.698 --> 27:27.233
- The Work...
- What is the Work?

27:27.267 --> 27:29.101
What are you building?

27:30.437 --> 27:32.238
Soon...

27:32.272 --> 27:34.607
Work finish...

27:34.641 --> 27:36.275
Soon...

27:36.309 --> 27:37.309
Soon...

27:37.344 --> 27:38.511
- No.
- Soon...

27:38.545 --> 27:39.912
- We're losing him again.
- Work...

27:39.946 --> 27:40.913
Finish!

27:40.947 --> 27:42.581
Soon!

27:42.616 --> 27:44.517
Soon! Soon!

27:44.551 --> 27:46.785
Soon, soon, soon!

27:46.820 --> 27:48.521
Sir, come with me, please.

27:48.555 --> 27:51.757
Soon! Soon!

27:51.791 --> 27:54.760
Soon! Soon! Soon!

28:01.334 --> 28:03.302
Sedation protocol.

28:11.211 --> 28:13.779
Did you hear what he said?

28:13.813 --> 28:17.049
The Protomolecule has an objective.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.514
The Work.

28:19.719 --> 28:22.288
Whatever it's building on Venus
is almost done.

28:22.322 --> 28:25.057
We need to know more.
You have to keep him talking.

28:25.091 --> 28:26.992
Well, I was able
to slow the transformation,

28:27.027 --> 28:29.461
but I can't stop it.

28:29.496 --> 28:31.797
His internal organs are changing.

28:31.831 --> 28:35.134
The vocal cords,
the structure of his brain.

28:35.168 --> 28:37.703
I'm sorry, sir. He won't be
talking to us again.

28:38.325 --> 28:40.472
Then we need another conduit.

28:40.507 --> 28:41.907
Well, the subject

28:41.942 --> 28:43.475
hybridized with the Protomolecule

28:43.510 --> 28:45.411
better than anyone I've ever seen.

28:45.445 --> 28:46.645
Of the remaining subjects,

28:46.680 --> 28:47.880
the one with the most similar

28:47.914 --> 28:49.548
genetic profile would be...

28:51.685 --> 28:53.586
Mei Ming.

29:01.294 --> 29:02.494
Make it happen.

29:13.106 --> 29:15.774
Your family accounts are now unfrozen.

29:15.809 --> 29:17.276
You will transfer launch control

29:17.310 --> 29:20.512
of the hybrid pods
to my ship immediately.

29:20.547 --> 29:22.448
The tech team will be down shortly

29:22.482 --> 29:25.517
to collect all of the materials
related to the project.

29:28.121 --> 29:29.788
Understood.

29:29.823 --> 29:31.724
Transferring launch control now.

29:52.178 --> 29:53.612
Gus.

29:53.647 --> 29:55.047
We've known each other a long time.

29:55.081 --> 29:56.749
Just couldn't leave it alone, could you?

29:56.783 --> 29:58.484
There's still time to make this right.

29:58.518 --> 29:59.652
You're relieved of duty

29:59.686 --> 30:01.120
and confined to quarters.

30:01.154 --> 30:03.389
Try anything else,
and I will have you in irons.

30:04.924 --> 30:06.725
Sir, it's the "Hammurabi."

30:06.760 --> 30:08.394
We're almost within range
of their torpedoes.

30:08.428 --> 30:09.728
Battle stations.

30:23.176 --> 30:24.443
We should have a firing solution

30:24.477 --> 30:25.567
on the "Agatha King" in five minutes.

30:25.602 --> 30:26.912
How long before the rest of the fleet

30:26.946 --> 30:28.180
will be able to engage?

30:28.214 --> 30:29.748
11 ship should have firing solutions

30:29.783 --> 30:30.749
three minutes after we do.

30:30.784 --> 30:31.750
Full fleet engagement

30:31.785 --> 30:33.786
five minutes after that.

30:37.857 --> 30:39.758
I want a slower approach.

30:39.793 --> 30:41.460
Increase braking burn 1/4.

30:41.494 --> 30:42.494
Aye-aye, sir.

30:42.529 --> 30:44.129
- Captain, what...
- Chief.

30:44.164 --> 30:46.532
Get Sinopoli up here on the double.

30:46.566 --> 30:48.267
Right away, sir.

30:50.804 --> 30:53.005
You sent that video to Souther.

30:55.475 --> 30:56.809
- Sir, that could be considered...
- I know what

30:56.843 --> 30:58.811
it could be considered.

31:00.146 --> 31:02.681
We have two fleets
bearing down on each other.

31:02.716 --> 31:06.018
74 ships, thousands
and thousands of lives,

31:06.052 --> 31:08.320
and the only thing
we're likely to accomplish

31:08.354 --> 31:09.621
is annihilating each other.

31:09.656 --> 31:12.624
That video doesn't change that.

31:12.659 --> 31:17.563
War is an inherently unstable
interaction of three things:

31:17.597 --> 31:21.533
intense emotion, politics, and luck.

31:21.568 --> 31:24.303
That message was luck.

31:24.337 --> 31:27.673
Maybe out there, away from
all the politics and bullshit,

31:27.707 --> 31:30.008
luck opens a door
and lets a couple of grunts

31:30.043 --> 31:33.178
figure out how not to fight.

31:33.213 --> 31:35.147
For once.

31:35.181 --> 31:37.049
That's great and noble, sir,

31:37.083 --> 31:40.319
but we're in a shooting war,
and I prefer to win it.

32:10.316 --> 32:11.850
Doc,

32:11.885 --> 32:13.719
no matter what happens down there,

32:13.753 --> 32:15.454
I got your back.

32:15.488 --> 32:17.689
Thank you.

32:17.724 --> 32:19.525
I mean, if we don't find her,

32:19.559 --> 32:23.529
- or if we do and she's...
- I'll be ready for that, too.

32:56.596 --> 32:58.897
What the hell was that?

33:14.786 --> 33:16.653
Override's no good!

33:16.688 --> 33:18.288
Hydraulics are behind that plate.

33:19.524 --> 33:20.624
Feels pretty thick.

33:20.658 --> 33:22.225
We can cut it.

33:28.800 --> 33:31.001
Their weapons are better than ours.

33:32.303 --> 33:33.770
They have a firing solution.

33:33.805 --> 33:35.747
Why the hell aren't they firing?

33:37.075 --> 33:38.609
They're testing us.

33:53.191 --> 33:55.192
Captain, we'll be
within range of their missiles

33:55.226 --> 33:58.095
in two minutes
and their full fleet in six.

34:00.665 --> 34:02.199
Maintain speed and trajectory.

34:02.233 --> 34:03.634
Ready target lock.

34:03.668 --> 34:06.203
Undersecretary Avasarala.

34:06.237 --> 34:08.739
Are she and Souther close?

34:08.773 --> 34:11.274
I don't know, sir. She didn't really say.

34:12.543 --> 34:14.645
What was she like?

34:14.679 --> 34:17.280
Uh, kind of mean, at first.

34:18.683 --> 34:20.375
I think I liked her.

34:21.342 --> 34:22.810
Captain, we have a firing solution

34:22.844 --> 34:25.079
on an enemy vessel.
What are your orders, sir?

34:30.351 --> 34:32.687
Maintain course and speed.

34:34.755 --> 34:35.989
They don't want to shoot.

34:36.024 --> 34:37.992
If they did, they'd have done it already.

34:38.025 --> 34:40.661
They're testing us to see
who we really are,

34:40.696 --> 34:42.330
if we're honorable or not.

34:42.364 --> 34:44.398
There's no honor in defeat.

34:44.433 --> 34:46.033
Weapons, prepare all tubes.

34:46.068 --> 34:47.935
We're going to give them
everything we've got.

34:47.969 --> 34:49.670
- Belay that order!
- Move it!

34:49.705 --> 34:50.670
- Don't move!
- Hey, freeze!

34:50.706 --> 34:52.206
Don't fucking move!

34:54.543 --> 34:56.577
In accordance with
the Military Code of Justice,

34:56.612 --> 34:58.045
I am relieving you of command.

34:58.080 --> 34:59.347
This is mutiny!

34:59.381 --> 35:01.782
For conspiring to wage an illegal war.

35:01.817 --> 35:03.918
I have proof. Take him into custody.

35:03.952 --> 35:05.545
Are you insane?

35:06.221 --> 35:07.922
Comms,

35:07.956 --> 35:10.024
give me wide-band, unencrypted.

35:10.058 --> 35:11.292
All ships in the AO.

35:11.326 --> 35:12.527
Sir?

35:12.561 --> 35:14.061
All ships.

35:14.096 --> 35:16.564
Earth and Mars.

35:17.633 --> 35:19.767
Channel open, sir.

35:19.801 --> 35:22.703
This is Admiral Souther
of the UNN "Agatha King."

35:22.738 --> 35:24.639
We are standing down.

35:24.673 --> 35:28.042
I repeat, we are standing down.

35:28.076 --> 35:30.278
I have relieved
Fleet Admiral Nguyen of duties

35:30.312 --> 35:32.413
under charges of conspiracy.

35:32.447 --> 35:34.982
We're fighting an illegal war.

35:35.017 --> 35:38.052
I'll be transmitting proof
to both fleets.

35:40.255 --> 35:42.890
I'm ordering all UNN ships
to take any actions necessary

35:42.925 --> 35:45.059
if the "Agatha"...

36:10.018 --> 36:12.587
You're under arrest for attempted mutiny.

36:16.058 --> 36:17.701
They're breaking off.

36:18.860 --> 36:20.328
Traitors.

36:20.362 --> 36:22.196
Comms, give me the fleet.

36:22.230 --> 36:23.431
Our fleet.

36:23.465 --> 36:26.100
Yes, sir. Channel open.

36:26.134 --> 36:28.002
This is Admiral Nguyen.

36:28.036 --> 36:29.704
We have put down an attempted mutiny

36:29.738 --> 36:31.339
by Admiral Souther.

36:31.373 --> 36:34.275
All ships are ordered
to return to the AO immediately

36:34.309 --> 36:35.977
and prepare to engage.

36:41.083 --> 36:42.883
Who hasn't acknowledged?

36:42.918 --> 36:46.120
The "Heisserer" and the "Jimenez."

36:46.154 --> 36:48.155
Fricking PT boat.

36:49.658 --> 36:52.059
Comms, give me a tight beam
to the "Jimenez."

36:52.094 --> 36:53.828
Tight beam open.

36:53.862 --> 36:55.630
"Jimenez," this is Admiral Nguyen.

36:55.664 --> 36:57.398
I am ordering you

36:57.432 --> 36:59.400
to return to the fleet

36:59.434 --> 37:01.235
or be considered a deserter.

37:05.173 --> 37:07.708
They're not changing course, sir.

37:07.743 --> 37:10.003
There's five ships still moving off.

37:11.013 --> 37:12.380
Weapons, give me a missile lock

37:12.414 --> 37:13.414
on the "Jimenez."

37:33.535 --> 37:35.403
If there's anyone else here

37:35.437 --> 37:37.838
who is unwilling

37:37.873 --> 37:39.507
to follow my lawful order,

37:39.541 --> 37:41.509
declare yourself now.

37:56.925 --> 37:58.359
Take them all to the brig.

37:58.393 --> 37:59.994
Yes, sir.

38:01.563 --> 38:02.997
Move!

38:05.667 --> 38:06.701
"Jimenez,"

38:06.735 --> 38:09.236
this is your final warning.

38:09.271 --> 38:11.739
Return to the fleet
or you will be fired upon.

38:17.779 --> 38:20.381
"Jimenez," acknowledge.

38:34.914 --> 38:37.049
The "Jimenez" it's been destroyed Sir.

39:15.899 --> 39:18.267
Jesus, they're firing on each other.

39:18.302 --> 39:20.452
Captain, they're in disarray.
We should take them out.

39:20.453 --> 39:22.054
No.

39:23.690 --> 39:25.624
Open a channel to our fleet.

39:27.126 --> 39:28.460
You're on, sir.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.200
All MCRN ships,

39:35.235 --> 39:37.836
this is the captain of the "Hammurabi."

39:37.871 --> 39:38.837
Hold your fire.

39:38.872 --> 39:41.173
I repeat, hold your fire.

39:42.075 --> 39:44.276
There's been a mutiny
aboard the "Agatha King"

39:44.310 --> 39:47.779
and UNN ships are firing on each other.

39:47.814 --> 39:49.615
If we engage,

39:49.649 --> 39:50.816
it will only unite them

39:50.850 --> 39:53.018
to turn their weapons on us.

39:54.220 --> 39:56.788
If they want to destroy each other,

39:56.823 --> 39:58.379
we will let them.

39:59.425 --> 40:00.859
"Hammurabi" out.

40:02.929 --> 40:05.197
Now I want to talk to the UNN.

40:24.350 --> 40:26.652
Get me an auto-doc.

40:26.686 --> 40:28.487
Seal off the CIC.

40:30.023 --> 40:31.723
We're in lockdown.

40:31.758 --> 40:33.292
Yes, sir.

40:34.394 --> 40:36.328
This is Captain Sandrine Kirino

40:36.362 --> 40:38.397
of the MCRN "Hammurabi"

40:38.431 --> 40:40.866
to all UNN ships in this AO.

40:40.900 --> 40:43.602
Any vessel that declares
its peaceful intentions

40:43.636 --> 40:46.104
will not be fired upon by Mars

40:46.139 --> 40:47.906
and will be considered to be flying

40:47.941 --> 40:49.508
under a flag of truce.

40:49.542 --> 40:51.910
If any vessel requires assistance,

40:51.945 --> 40:54.644
we are ready and able to help.

40:55.548 --> 40:57.049
Admiral,

40:57.083 --> 40:58.850
how do you wish to respond?
