<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.115 --> 00:16.878
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.617
<i>[Man Narrating] Michael came home</i>
<i>to find his brother-in-law Tobias...</i>

00:23.723 --> 00:27.386
- <i>who'd been kicked out of</i>
<i>the house earlier that week.</i>
- How are you?

00:27.494 --> 00:29.394
- [Chuckles]
- Good.

00:29.496 --> 00:32.293
- Didn't I already see you today?
- Not that I know of.

00:32.399 --> 00:35.800
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Michael</i> had <i>seen him earlier that day...</i>

00:35.902 --> 00:38.894
<i>as Tobias had been posing as an English</i>
<i>nanny named Mrs. Featherbottom.</i>

00:39.005 --> 00:41.439
Who'd like a banger
in the mouth?

00:41.541 --> 00:46.774
Oh, right. I forgot. Here in the States
you call it a sausage in the mouth.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.976
- We just call it a sausage.
- <i>[Narrator] The family,</i>
<i>of course, knew it was Tobias...</i>

00:51.084 --> 00:52.608
<i>but the house had</i>
<i>never been cleaner.</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:55.381
Hello, young lady.
I haven't seen you in a week.

00:55.488 --> 00:58.889
<i>Oh. Right. That means</i>
<i>Mrs. Featherbottom isn't here.</i>

00:58.992 --> 01:01.586
Which means she didn't iron
my blouse...

01:01.694 --> 01:05.152
which means I don't have
anything to wear for my premiere.

01:05.265 --> 01:08.166
<i>The</i> premier-
of Canada.

01:08.268 --> 01:10.634
He's going out
with my gym teacher.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.228
<i>[Narrator] Maeby was actually</i>
<i>referring to the premiere of a film...</i>

01:13.339 --> 01:16.399
<i>from the studio</i>
<i>where she had conned her way into a job.</i>

01:16.509 --> 01:18.670
Hey, Jeff. Did you get
a chance to do coverage on...

01:18.778 --> 01:20.678
<i>Voices In America:</i>
<i>History In Prespective?</i>

01:20.780 --> 01:24.238
Yeah. I looked that up.
It's a ninth grade history textbook.

01:24.350 --> 01:28.787
Yeah. And if I don't get your report on it,
I won't be able to pass.

01:28.888 --> 01:32.847
On it.
Because I have a feeling it's a piece of- [Bleeps]

01:32.959 --> 01:35.928
<i>[Narrator] Unfortunately, thejob was</i>
<i>wreaking havoc with her language.</i>

01:36.029 --> 01:38.293
Maybe we just need a new-
[Bleeps] housekeeper.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.559
<i>Okay. I'm sure she would</i>
<i>have ironed it for you...</i>

01:40.667 --> 01:43.795
had you told her about it before
she changed out of her bloody work clothes.

01:43.903 --> 01:46.770
<i>But I am off then.</i>

01:49.375 --> 01:52.105
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- I gotta keep him trying. That is the job.

01:54.814 --> 01:56.782
Michael, what are you
doing tomorrow?

01:56.883 --> 02:00.114
Having my day ruined with
whatever you're about to ask me to do.

02:00.220 --> 02:04.122
It's my wedding anniversary,
and Oscar wants to throw me a party.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.852
He is aware that
he's not married to you, right?

02:06.960 --> 02:10.794
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Oscar had started to perceive</i>
<i>that Lucille was pulling away from him.</i>

02:10.896 --> 02:14.298
Not now.
It's my time of the month.

02:14.400 --> 02:19.133
Not now. I don't want to risk
having a baby. It could kill me.

02:19.239 --> 02:22.504
- <i>[Narrator] So he went to Buster for advice.</i>
- I think she misses my brother.

02:22.609 --> 02:25.806
- My father?
- Yes? I mean, yes.

02:25.912 --> 02:29.075
- Maybe I should throw her an anniversary party.
- [Gasps] Oh.

02:29.182 --> 02:32.982
So when he doesn't show, she'll realize that
you were the one who was always there for us.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.714
Well, I was thinking one more party,
and then I'd move out.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.915
But no.
I like your plan better.

02:38.024 --> 02:40.891
The only problem is we know he's-
he's around somewhere.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.155
Well, he didn't return
when I lost my hand.

02:43.263 --> 02:46.096
But you-
you not only embrace it...

02:46.199 --> 02:49.327
but I saw you kissing it
while you thought I was sleeping.

02:49.435 --> 02:52.666
- [Squeaking Sound]
- <i>[Vocalizing]</i>

02:52.772 --> 02:54.740
<i>[Singing]</i>

02:54.841 --> 02:58.174
<i>Who knows what goes on in</i>
<i>that pot-addled mind ofhis.</i>

02:58.278 --> 03:01.736
Anyway, it's a party,
and I want the whole family there.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.078
- We're havin' a party?
- No.

03:04.184 --> 03:08.848
<i>Well, I'm sorry if I don't want you</i>
<i>doing one of your stupid puppet shows.</i>

03:08.955 --> 03:12.914
I did that once, Mom.
And a lot of people thought it was pretty cool.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.085
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In an effort to hip up his act...</i>

03:15.195 --> 03:17.356
<i>Gob had briefly</i>
<i>introduced a puppet.</i>

03:17.463 --> 03:20.364
- Can I tell you somethin', my man?
- Sure, Franklin.

03:20.466 --> 03:24.596
<i>You are one cool</i>- 
<i>[Bleeps]</i>

03:24.704 --> 03:29.573
Speakin' of mothers,
let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar.

03:29.676 --> 03:33.077
- Get off my wife, you bastard!
- Oh, man. What's the matter with you?

03:33.179 --> 03:35.147
Franklin said some things
Whitey wasn't ready to hear.

03:35.248 --> 03:39.207
Gob, weren't you also mercilessly beaten
outside of a club in Torrance for that act?

03:39.319 --> 03:42.584
He also said some things that
African-Americany wasn't ready to hear either.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.884
You know, Mom,
we have no idea where Dad is.

03:44.991 --> 03:46.891
How's he gonna
hear about the party?

03:46.993 --> 03:49.484
Why do you have
the baby monitor out?

03:49.596 --> 03:52.724
- [Michael] I'm, uh, listening in-
- She wants her man back.

03:52.832 --> 03:56.097
- On my son.
- Yo, man. You're gonna get your
sorry white ass thrown in jail.

03:56.202 --> 03:59.137
I said that's enough.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.265
<i>[Narrator] Michael came up with an excuse</i>
<i>he knew his mother would understand.</i>

04:02.375 --> 04:04.741
I'm listening in on my son.

04:04.844 --> 04:07.438
I'm a little worried
about his girlfriend, Ann.

04:07.547 --> 04:10.243
<i>My advice, get one of those teddy bears</i>
<i>with the cameras in them.</i>

04:10.350 --> 04:14.343
I had one in Buster's room to make sure
he wasn't getting too serious with anyone.

04:14.454 --> 04:18.481
As it turned out,
he got too serious with the teddy bear.

04:18.591 --> 04:23.028
I'll see you
at the anniversary party.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.620
- Gangy's having an anniversary party?
- Seems that way.

04:25.732 --> 04:29.190
- Is Franklin gonna be there?
- See that, Mike? Kids love Franklin.

04:29.302 --> 04:32.328
I just don't want him to point out
my cracker ass in front of Ann.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.442
Imagine what he'd say
about her.

04:36.542 --> 04:39.636
So you <i>were</i> listening in
on George Michael.

04:39.746 --> 04:42.180
Can you believe
what he asked me this morning?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.614
Do you think my mom's
engagement ring is still around?

04:44.717 --> 04:48.551
Of course it is. Your father would never
part with something so precious.

04:48.655 --> 04:53.456
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Lindsay was currently</i>
<i>wearing it on her middle toe, roast beef.</i>

04:53.559 --> 04:55.857
I'm thinking of asking Ann
to get pre-engaged.

04:55.962 --> 05:00.023
- You are?
- Yeah. I feel like God moved her
here from Ohio to be with me.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.296
- <i>[George] Her?</i>
- Well, that's the first I've heard of this.

05:03.403 --> 05:06.839
- Well, then who said "Her?"
- Me. That was-That was me.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.499
But, um, her?

05:09.609 --> 05:11.975
Look, it's just a pre-engagement.
It's exciting.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.705
You know,
it's young love.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.748
I had it once.
A man I loved-

05:18.418 --> 05:22.013
- Here's young Maeby's blouse.
- And then things took a turn somehow.

05:22.121 --> 05:25.818
<i>Master Bluth.</i>
<i>I haven't seen you in a week's time.</i>

05:25.925 --> 05:28.985
Actually, you tried to put a banger
in my mouth this morning.

05:29.095 --> 05:32.462
Oh, was it this morn-
Well, I'm sorry.

05:32.565 --> 05:36.331
- I'm just so exhausted.
- So I'm just gonna talk to my son.

05:36.436 --> 05:39.496
I'm gonna tell him that I'm against this.
I don't like her.

05:39.605 --> 05:42.574
You know, maybe if you
stop judging her, he'd trust you.

05:42.675 --> 05:46.611
Look, if you say no,
you're just gonna drive him right to her.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.943
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>
<i>Can you drive me to Ann's?</i>

05:49.048 --> 05:51.346
N-N-N-

05:51.451 --> 05:55.046
- Y-Yes.
- Great. I'll wait in the car.

05:55.154 --> 05:57.452
I don't think that worked.

05:57.557 --> 06:02.688
<i>[Narrator] Meanwhile, Gob went to check on</i>
<i>the one friend who didn't mind having him around.</i>

06:02.795 --> 06:05.628
<i>[George]</i>
<i>Get your loser hand out of my ass.</i>

06:05.732 --> 06:08.360
- Hello, Son.
- Oh, Dad. I thought- Dad?

06:08.468 --> 06:11.494
This is where you've been hi- Michael.

06:11.604 --> 06:13.572
I just came back
because of your mother.

06:13.673 --> 06:16.198
She's with my brother
on my anniversary.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.209
But I got an idea
from George Michael.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.245
I need to recommit myself
to your mother.

06:20.346 --> 06:23.247
- Her?
- But you gotta get me into that party.

06:23.349 --> 06:25.283
Then you gotta
take me to this church.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.512
I found this brochure
that Ann left behind.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.088
That's gonna be tough.
I'm not really all that invited.

06:30.189 --> 06:32.623
I got it all worked out,
but I need a limousine.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.250
L- I can do this, Dad.
I'm gonna make you proud.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.727
Never too late to start.

06:37.830 --> 06:43.063
<i>[Narrator] And Michael drove to Ann's house,</i>
<i>where he finally got to meet Ann's parents.</i>

06:43.169 --> 06:45.797
This is my father,
Pastor Terry Veal.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.397
- Hello.
- Oh, Pastor. I didn't know. You didn't tell me.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.409
- I told you.
- No, you didn't.

06:51.511 --> 06:54.105
People treat you so differently
when they find out you're a man of God.

06:54.213 --> 06:57.774
- Oh, believe me, I know.
- Oh, are you a churchgoing man?

06:57.884 --> 06:59.613
I am.

06:59.719 --> 07:02.654
Sometimes. Yes.
I don't go religiously.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.780
I mean,
I'm not a nut about it.

07:04.891 --> 07:09.191
Because there is no such thing
as a nut when it comes to religion, Pastor.

07:09.295 --> 07:11.627
I've met a few.

07:11.731 --> 07:14.529
I'm sure if you look a bit closer
you'll find some very earnest people...

07:14.634 --> 07:16.534
that are just
doing their best.

07:16.636 --> 07:18.536
<i>- What are you doin', Dad?</i>
- I'm not sure.

07:18.638 --> 07:22.506
Why don't you kids run along and let us
get to know each other a bit better? Thank you.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.099
- Maybe I should get my wife. Honey.
- Okay.

07:25.211 --> 07:27.111
<i>[Pastor Veal]</i>
<i>This is George Michael's father.</i>

07:27.213 --> 07:30.444
<i>This is your wife.</i>
<i>Didn't</i>- <i>Didn't realize you could remarry.</i>

07:30.550 --> 07:33.678
- What?
- Is this Ann's mother?

07:33.786 --> 07:35.947
- I'm Mrs. Veal.
- I'm sorry. I just-

07:36.055 --> 07:38.387
I did not expect
somebody so young.

07:38.491 --> 07:41.119
Next you're gonna say
how Ann and I can be sisters.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.491
No, I'd never say that.

07:43.596 --> 07:45.291
Listen, I'm here because...

07:45.398 --> 07:49.061
I think my son might be planning on
asking your daughter to get pre-engaged.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.329
- <i>Oh, my gosh.</i>
- Oh, my gosh.

07:51.437 --> 07:53.962
Well, that is something
to celebrate.

07:54.073 --> 07:56.564
Can we open up
some sparkling apple cider?

07:56.676 --> 07:59.645
- No.
- Oh, did you want us to
go down to the liquor store...

07:59.745 --> 08:01.645
and get you some liquor?

08:01.747 --> 08:03.806
No. Don't you think
they're a bit too young?

08:03.916 --> 08:05.645
Oh, we got serious
around his age.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.844
Who can blame you?
You gotta lock that down.

08:07.954 --> 08:10.149
But I'm not quite sure
that they're ready.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.225
Michael, in my experience,
there is no recipe for a perfect match.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.590
<i>It takes the love</i>
<i>of two families.</i>

08:15.695 --> 08:17.856
Well, you haven't met
my family.

08:17.964 --> 08:21.866
<i>[Narrator] And that's when Michael devised</i>
<i>a new plan to win the Veals'disapproval.</i>

08:21.968 --> 08:24.402
You haven't met my family.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.529
You should meet my family.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.732
We're gonna be having
an anniversary party.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.866
[Pastor Veal]
What a wonderful surprise.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.912
We would love to witness
a celebration of their love.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.981
That would be
a wonderful surprise.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.277
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>But he did want a little bit of insurance.</i>

08:38.384 --> 08:43.082
Hey, Gob.
Mom wants Franklin at the party.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.623
Yeah. What?

08:45.725 --> 08:49.058
No, no, no. I don't want to talk-
Hey, Franklin.

08:54.166 --> 08:57.465
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Lucille was setting up for the anniversary party...</i>

08:57.570 --> 08:59.731
<i>that she didn't expect</i>
<i>her husband to attend.</i>

08:59.839 --> 09:02.535
- <i>[Lucille] Where's the food?</i>
- Sorry. Just stuffing the mushroom.

09:02.642 --> 09:05.975
<i>You realize that's Tobias,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

09:06.078 --> 09:08.478
If he's gonna raid my closet,
he's gonna work for it.

09:08.581 --> 09:12.210
- What happened to his ankle?
- <i>[Narrator] Tobias had attempted an entrance...</i>

09:12.318 --> 09:14.218
<i>that he hoped</i>
<i>would enchant his daughter.</i>

09:14.320 --> 09:16.288
[Singing In Falsetto]

09:16.389 --> 09:19.381
Ohhhh!

09:19.492 --> 09:22.825
We shan't be telling
your mother this, shan't we?

09:22.929 --> 09:27.127
Maybe you can point out to your mother
that your father hasn't arrived yet.

09:28.167 --> 09:32.263
Hmm. So, my father's
not here.

09:32.371 --> 09:35.135
Maybe he is.

09:38.544 --> 09:42.002
Ann just called. They had a predawn mass,
and then they're gonna go to mass, so-

09:42.114 --> 09:45.083
Well, Ann's got
a great deal of mass.

09:45.184 --> 09:48.153
Anyway, I hope
that the Veals like us.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.313
Why don't you go top off
your Gangy? Thanks.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.448
Wait a minute.
You invited the Veals?

09:52.558 --> 09:54.788
Only so that they'll
disapprove of us.

09:54.894 --> 09:57.089
I gotta kill this
pre-engagement somehow.

09:57.196 --> 09:59.756
And after Mom's second vodka,
and after Buster's second juice box...

09:59.865 --> 10:02.095
they're gonna forbid Ann
from even seeing my son...

10:02.201 --> 10:05.170
much less taking his ring,
and I'm still the good guy.

10:05.271 --> 10:09.332
So the devout religious family-
they're the bad guys?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.501
You'll understand when Maeby
starts getting proposals.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.171
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Actually, Maeby had given two that day.</i>

10:14.280 --> 10:16.612
<i>I'm sorry. I can't read</i>
<i>what you wrote on this buck slip.</i>

10:16.716 --> 10:18.877
You've got the handwriting
of a 15-year-old.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.283
Fifteen-year-old.
Marry me!

10:23.422 --> 10:26.391
Hey, I'm almost done with that coverage.
I can bring it to you tonight.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.392
Are you still
at the Balboa Towers?

10:28.494 --> 10:31.122
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Maeby had used her grandmother's address...</i>

10:31.230 --> 10:33.130
<i>so as not to arouse</i>
<i>suspicion at home.</i>

10:33.232 --> 10:36.497
<i>This required convincing the guard</i>
<i>she was several years younger than her age.</i>

10:36.602 --> 10:39.503
Boy, you get a lot of mail
from that movie studio.

10:39.605 --> 10:42.039
I write a lot of letters
to movie stars.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.974
- You seem a little old for that.
- Babysit me.

10:45.077 --> 10:47.705
<i>That place seems</i>
<i>so old for you.</i>

10:47.813 --> 10:49.747
I'll send Dr. Epstein
your compliments.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.340
- And may I add, marry me.
- Okay.

10:52.451 --> 10:56.080
<i>[Narrator] And Maeby realized</i>
<i>she might be in need of a new deflection.</i>

10:56.188 --> 10:58.713
<i>[Michael]</i>
<i>Hi, Mrs. Veal. Welcome.</i>

10:58.824 --> 11:00.849
Mom, this is Ann's mother.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.860
Are you sure
this isn't her sister?

11:02.962 --> 11:06.557
- What a lovely thing to say.
- That's an awful thing to say, Mom. Please.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.566
I'm so eager
to meet your husband.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.502
Yeah. Dad escaped from prison.
Did you not know that?

11:12.605 --> 11:16.166
<i>[Narrator] In fact, George Sr. Had</i>
<i>just been picked up by his son.</i>

11:16.275 --> 11:20.006
Oh, great. It's stuck. All right.
Just stay down and let me handle this.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.080
Is that Mr. Bluth there?

11:23.182 --> 11:25.207
He's got us, Dad.
Come on out.

11:25.317 --> 11:27.911
<i>He's talking to you,</i>
<i>you idiot. Cover.</i>

11:28.020 --> 11:30.011
I ain't your daddy!

11:30.122 --> 11:33.216
How's it goin', brother?

11:33.325 --> 11:36.556
You want to pop the trunk
and roll the windows down, please?

11:41.500 --> 11:44.628
I'm just messin' with you. Hey, Franklin.
How you doin', little man?

11:48.174 --> 11:50.267
So I'm afraid Ann's
with my husband.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.435
He had a last-minute
vow renewal at the chapel.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.480
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>A call that was made by George Sr.</i>

11:55.581 --> 11:58.209
How do we get her to the church?
Tell her you're in here?

11:58.317 --> 12:00.911
No. Cover her eyes
and take her to the limo.

12:01.020 --> 12:04.786
No. Bring her in here, knock her out with this
ether, and you stuff her into this garment bag.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.121
Anyone sees, you do the same.
Oh, hi, Tobias.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.127
Oh.

12:10.229 --> 12:13.721
Whenever I get a wee bit scared
I hum a little tune

12:13.833 --> 12:15.733
Hum diddle diddly
Hum di-do

12:15.835 --> 12:18.497
You put a handkerchief over her mouth
for a couple of seconds.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.629
No more than two though.
'Cause you could kill her.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.298
- I don't have a handkerchief.
- Fine.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.809
Put the ether on the puppet's lips.
Have the puppet kiss her.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.902
I ain't kissin'
that old bitch.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.072
That's my wife, you bastard!

12:30.182 --> 12:32.173
Dad, that's my wrist!

12:32.284 --> 12:35.583
[Groaning]
Hey, man! That's his neck!

12:35.688 --> 12:38.851
Hey, Gob. Mrs. Veal,
this is my brother Gob.

12:38.958 --> 12:41.449
- Where's your pal Franklin?
- Throat's a little sore.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.028
And wrist.
Nice to meet you.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.155
What a lovely family.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.699
Does it seem that way?
Where's Buster?

12:48.801 --> 12:50.769
[Whispers]
Should help.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.839
It's really great you did this.
I thought you didn't even like Ann.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.669
But since you do, I thought maybe
I could get your opinion.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.040
I was thinking of giving her, like,
a pre-engagement-

12:59.145 --> 13:01.477
- Ring?
- Ah.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.447
Wow. That catches me off guard,
George Michael. I'm not sure about that.

13:04.550 --> 13:06.848
I don't know if it's-

13:06.952 --> 13:08.886
I think it's gonna
backfire on you.

13:08.988 --> 13:12.082
I think it could backfire on you
because it's gonna seem...

13:12.191 --> 13:14.716
like you're taking marriage,
uh, lightly, you know.

13:14.827 --> 13:17.352
And you can't.
It's very sacred.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.261
- Sacred.
- Yeah. That's it.

13:20.366 --> 13:22.266
All right.
Well, yeah.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.268
You know, it did kind of
feel right to me.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.032
- But, yeah. I've gotta trust you, right?
- Thank you. Thank you.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.369
Damn. Maybe I should-

13:29.475 --> 13:33.809
Maybe I should ask if she wants to get
pre-pre-engaged. Add another-

13:33.913 --> 13:35.881
The mere fact that you're
laughing about marriage...

13:35.981 --> 13:38.245
- means that you're not ready, okay?
- Wha-

13:38.350 --> 13:40.875
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Lucille was asked to the kitchen.</i>

13:40.986 --> 13:44.979
What's so important that you're dragging me
away from this miserable party?

13:45.090 --> 13:48.821
Well, I just had an old friend
who wanted to tell you...

13:48.928 --> 13:51.556
how much I miss you!

13:51.664 --> 13:55.156
Oh, who let this little black-
[Bleeps]

13:55.267 --> 13:57.030
Hey, Brother.

13:57.136 --> 13:59.832
- Who you callin' brother, you hook-ass-
- Mother!

13:59.939 --> 14:02.271
- [Horn Blows]
- [Groaning]

14:03.943 --> 14:06.173
What the hell kind of puppet
does Buster have on his hand?

14:06.278 --> 14:08.269
Just let me think.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.348
God, Franklin.
Your breath- Oh, God.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.747
<i>So I'm really getting excited</i>
<i>about your proposal.</i>

14:12.852 --> 14:14.717
Oh, yeah.
I'm not gonna do it now.

14:14.820 --> 14:17.118
Because Ann's mom doesn't approve
of our family? Come on.

14:17.223 --> 14:19.691
It's just some stupid plan
your father was trying.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.919
Plan?

14:22.027 --> 14:23.358
What plan?

14:23.462 --> 14:25.430
Well, it's off. Sorry.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.522
I know that you were
excited about it.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.363
But, uh, you know,
in the secular world...

14:30.469 --> 14:32.369
I feel like
they're a bit young.

14:32.471 --> 14:36.703
You know, l- I didn't want to say anything
in front ofTerry, but I agree.

14:36.809 --> 14:40.176
I mean, perhaps there's someone else
they're meant to meet.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.907
Well, let's- let's just say
that in the secular world...

14:43.015 --> 14:46.109
one finds oneself
with their fair share of temptations.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.652
Not that anyone
would ever act-

14:48.754 --> 14:50.551
- [Mumbling]
- Take me.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.556
- Mrs. Veal.
- Take me to your secular world.

14:52.658 --> 14:54.558
<i>[Michael]</i>
<i>Hey. Hey, listen.</i>

14:54.660 --> 14:57.720
I can't believe my dad. First he's saying
I need to respect the sanctity of marriage...

14:57.830 --> 14:59.730
then he's making out with her
on the balcony.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.562
- I thought he didn't even like Ann.
- No, no. Mrs. Veal.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.761
Know what else he's not gonna like?
I'm getting pre-engaged.

15:04.870 --> 15:07.498
- God, that's so romantic.
- The hell with him.

15:09.775 --> 15:12.972
Take it.
Take the sacred ring.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.137
Not the snake.
That doesn't come off.

15:19.285 --> 15:23.085
<i>[Narrator] Michael hadjust been kissed</i>
<i>by the mother ofhis son's girlfriend.</i>

15:23.188 --> 15:25.156
- Oh, my golly!
- Listen.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.590
- Don't do this. Don't do this.
- I can't believe we're making love.

15:28.694 --> 15:32.653
- What are you talking about?
We're not making love.
- I want to please you secularly.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.428
- We're not gonna do this.
- But you kept telling me how beautiful I was.

15:36.535 --> 15:38.969
I was surprised
because of Ann.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.595
- Well-
- Why because of Ann?

15:40.706 --> 15:43.800
Because of
<i>an</i> old wives' tale.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.934
- Oh, I'm so ashamed.
- All right. No-

15:46.045 --> 15:47.979
Mrs. Veal.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.948
Jolly news, governor.
Young master's proposing.

15:52.051 --> 15:55.020
George Michael?
I told him not to. He said he wouldn't.

15:55.120 --> 15:59.352
Well, this was before he saw you
pounding that sweet piece of veal.

15:59.458 --> 16:03.451
- He saw that? Where is he?
- Oh, he left with Lady Lindsay-

16:03.562 --> 16:06.861
- Tobias, where are they?
- It is me. It's Tobias.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.991
<i>[Oscar Yells]</i>

- What happened?
- <i>What's going on?</i>

16:11.103 --> 16:13.469
<i>Gob made me kiss Franklin.</i>
<i>I think my father was here.</i>

16:13.572 --> 16:15.699
Maybe he still is.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.708
Shut up. What do you mean
he was here?

16:17.810 --> 16:20.210
I think he was
dragging my mother out with Gob.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.610
- Oh, you shut up.
- What's goin' on?

16:22.715 --> 16:25.309
<i>We're tryin'to figure that out.</i>
<i>Apparently Pop-Pop kidnapped Gangy...</i>

16:25.417 --> 16:27.715
and I have no idea where George Michael is-
or Lindsay.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.812
I just saw them drive off.
They're gonna go look for Bland.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.084
- Who's the hottie?
- This is Ann's mother.

16:33.192 --> 16:34.318
Her?

16:34.426 --> 16:37.088
Does she look old enough
to play Topher Grace's mom?

16:37.196 --> 16:39.494
- Where did you say Ann was?
- At the chapel.

16:39.598 --> 16:43.500
Yeah, we gotta get down there.
My son's gonna pre-propose to your daughter.

16:43.602 --> 16:47.368
<i>[Narrator] Fortunately,</i>
<i>Tobias had rented a car to maintain his ruse.</i>

16:47.473 --> 16:49.373
I had this shipped over
from "Blackstool."

It's what I used to drive
the Roger Moores about in.

<i>And Lucille awoke, half in the bag.</i>

It's me. I'm taking you
to renew our vows.

- But first-
- Uh, Dad-

17:03.856 --> 17:06.689
- <i>we make love.</i>
- The partition doesn't go
all the way up, remember?

17:06.791 --> 17:09.818
No. No. After your vows.

17:09.928 --> 17:12.692
I want to know you won't
run out on me again.

17:12.798 --> 17:16.426
- I need to know you're in it for keeps.
- Just let me see 'em.

17:16.535 --> 17:20.232
- Seriously, Dad. The radio doesn't work either.
<i>- [Lucille] George!</i>

<i>[Mrs. Veal]</i>
<i>Terry, I don't know what happened.</i>

19:57.129 --> 20:01.122
I fell under the spell
of that horrible secular family.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.201
Forgive me.

20:03.302 --> 20:06.533
<i>Could've used that horrible</i>
<i>family stuff about a halfhour ago.</i>

20:06.638 --> 20:09.766
I hope you notice
I didn't run.

20:09.875 --> 20:13.311
- You fought for me.
- What I meant to say is l- I think I broke my ankle.

20:13.412 --> 20:17.576
Let's alternate
hot and cool on that.

20:19.484 --> 20:22.214
- Guess the wedding's off?
- Yeah. That's okay, Dad.

20:22.321 --> 20:25.484
We were talking, and we think that
we were doin' it for the wrong reasons.

20:25.591 --> 20:29.459
Yeah? You have so much to experience before
you make a commitment you're not ready for.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.392
You need to get to
know each other better...

20:31.496 --> 20:34.556
and then you can be comfortable
going all the way with it.

20:34.666 --> 20:38.067
- Do you mean it?
- Yes. This time I'm being honest with you.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.900
- Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.

20:41.006 --> 20:45.739
It sounds like your father just
gave us permission to start doing it.

20:45.844 --> 20:48.005
You must teach me,
George Michael.

20:48.113 --> 20:51.412
You must teach me
the ways of the secular flesh.

20:51.516 --> 20:55.612
<i>[Singing]</i>

20:55.721 --> 20:57.916
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

20:58.023 --> 20:59.923
That doesn't bother you.

21:00.025 --> 21:03.256
<i>[Narrator] Buster finds someone else</i>
<i>interested in kissing his hook.</i>

21:03.362 --> 21:06.297
- Oh, God!
- Drug dog's got something. Get him, Bennett!

21:06.398 --> 21:08.662
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>So Buster gets a hook replacement.</i>

21:08.767 --> 21:11.258
They're not gonna let you in
at the country club with that.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.998
I don't want no part
of your tight-ass country club...

21:14.106 --> 21:16.199
you freak bitch!
