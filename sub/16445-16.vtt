<i>- Previously on</i> Gotham...
- Uncle Frank. Maybe you want to tell me

00:04.208 --> 00:05.737
where the hell you've
been since I was a kid.

00:05.777 --> 00:07.445
FRANK: <i> The Court is a secret society.</i>

00:07.479 --> 00:08.848
If it's so secret, how
do you know about them?

00:08.881 --> 00:10.483
Your father and I were both members.

00:10.516 --> 00:11.984
GORDON: <i> It was a drunk driver!</i>

00:12.016 --> 00:13.585
<i>I watched him die.</i>

00:13.618 --> 00:14.853
My brother was making trouble
and they killed him.

00:14.887 --> 00:15.721
(gasps)

00:15.753 --> 00:17.455
One cannot deny love.

00:17.489 --> 00:19.725
(gunshot)

00:19.757 --> 00:21.827
I... don't... love you.

00:23.027 --> 00:25.029
Look who's alive.

00:25.062 --> 00:26.164
I just remembered.

00:26.198 --> 00:27.600
There's someone I need to kill.

00:27.632 --> 00:30.468
- KATHRYN: <i>The clone is in place.</i>
- FRANK: <i> What about Bruce Wayne?</i>

00:30.501 --> 00:32.737
KATHRYN: <i> He should be
waking up as we speak.</i>

00:32.770 --> 00:35.140
FALCONE: I've always done whatever
the Court has asked of me.

00:35.174 --> 00:37.176
What aren't you telling me?

00:37.208 --> 00:39.010
This city is on the brink of chaos.

00:39.044 --> 00:42.647
Seems like judgment came to
Gotham earlier than expected.

00:43.782 --> 00:45.751
Members of the Ruling Council,

00:45.784 --> 00:48.187
Gotham has fallen ill.

00:48.220 --> 00:51.157
Violence and crime continue to spread

00:51.190 --> 00:53.793
like an unstoppable disease.

00:53.825 --> 00:57.163
Drastic action must be taken.

00:57.196 --> 01:01.634
To that end, a weapon is being built.

01:01.666 --> 01:05.037
A weapon intended to
be unleashed on Gotham

01:05.069 --> 01:09.909
so that the city may be
cleansed and rebuilt by us.

01:09.942 --> 01:12.544
The Head of our Court asks that we reach

01:12.577 --> 01:15.715
a unanimous vote to proceed.

02:36.761 --> 02:39.130
That would be me.

02:39.164 --> 02:42.134
Is the Court of Owls
behind my abduction?

02:42.166 --> 02:44.135
The Court is a tool. Nothing more.

02:44.169 --> 02:45.771
You won't get away with this.

02:45.803 --> 02:47.740
People will know I'm gone.

We've taken precautions

to ensure your absence

02:50.908 --> 02:52.844
won't be noticed.

My clone.

02:56.914 --> 02:59.251
He's in Gotham pretending
to be me, isn't he?

03:01.086 --> 03:02.888
Alfred will figure it out.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.156
Perhaps.

03:04.188 --> 03:05.890
But by that time,

03:05.924 --> 03:09.028
I'm hoping we've accomplished our goal.

03:09.061 --> 03:10.229
Which is what?

03:12.931 --> 03:15.234
I need your help, Bruce.

03:16.335 --> 03:18.170
Eat.

03:18.202 --> 03:21.640
You're going to need your strength.

03:21.672 --> 03:24.142
We'll begin soon.

03:27.945 --> 03:29.047
REPORTER: Aubrey James, the once and...

03:29.081 --> 03:30.649
All right, come on people, come on.

03:30.682 --> 03:32.051
Let's get back to work.
Joe, shut that off.

03:32.083 --> 03:33.785
Can you believe this nonsense?

03:33.819 --> 03:36.355
After all that's said and
done, who's back in charge?

03:36.388 --> 03:39.057
Aubrey James. The
original crook himself.

03:39.091 --> 03:40.659
How was the cabin?

03:40.692 --> 03:41.892
What?

03:41.926 --> 03:45.196
You and your uncle. You must've
had a lot to catch up on.

03:45.229 --> 03:46.931
Oh, yeah.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.099
Any word on Nygma?

03:48.133 --> 03:50.836
No. But after gassing the cadets

03:50.868 --> 03:52.705
and dangling me over an empty stairwell,

03:52.737 --> 03:54.740
he just disappeared.

03:54.772 --> 03:57.008
No riddles, puzzles or
singing telegrams, yet.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.846
Who's, uh, "Michael Ness"?

04:00.878 --> 04:03.215
(sighs) The drunk driver who
hit and killed my father

04:03.247 --> 04:04.749
when I was nine.

04:04.783 --> 04:06.819
Something my uncle said got me thinking.

04:06.852 --> 04:08.753
- What do you got?
- Not much.

04:08.787 --> 04:11.255
He was convicted of
vehicular manslaughter.

04:11.289 --> 04:13.225
Got six years.

04:13.258 --> 04:15.961
Then got his ticket punched in a
prison stabbing a few months in.

04:15.993 --> 04:16.861
Silver lining.

04:16.894 --> 04:18.228
Yeah.

04:18.262 --> 04:21.000
But I pulled his medical
file from Blackgate,

04:21.031 --> 04:23.368
found something that wasn't
in the original case file.

04:23.402 --> 04:25.137
He had "chronic persistent hepatitis."

04:25.169 --> 04:28.640
I was gonna ask Lee what
it was when she got in.

04:28.674 --> 04:30.109
Chronic persistent hepatitis
is a non-progressive form

04:30.142 --> 04:32.378
of liver inflammation.

04:32.411 --> 04:34.246
How do you know that?

04:34.279 --> 04:36.849
You kidding? It's known
as the Irish Curse.

04:36.881 --> 04:38.416
With chronic inflammation,

04:38.450 --> 04:39.985
you cannot drink. Nothing, not a drop.

04:40.017 --> 04:41.854
Not even beer.

04:41.887 --> 04:43.255
Well, this guy didn't get the memo.
His blood alcohol

04:43.287 --> 04:44.255
was off the charts the
night of the accident.

04:44.289 --> 04:45.858
You're not hearing me.

04:45.890 --> 04:47.760
If this guy had chronic
liver inflammation,

04:47.792 --> 04:49.293
if he blew a 0.1

04:49.327 --> 04:50.996
on a blood alcohol test,

04:51.029 --> 04:53.866
he'd be dead before he
got behind the wheel.

04:53.899 --> 04:57.036
If that's true, then someone
dummied the report.

04:57.068 --> 04:58.871
Can you do some digging?

04:58.904 --> 05:00.272
Find out who this guy was?

05:00.304 --> 05:01.172
Sure, but... Hey.

05:01.205 --> 05:03.109
Where you going?

05:11.450 --> 05:12.885
Ta-da!

05:12.917 --> 05:14.018
Pretty cool, huh?

05:14.051 --> 05:15.287
I told you the whole estate

05:15.320 --> 05:17.022
was abandoned... can you believe it?

05:17.054 --> 05:19.023
- As a matter of fact, I can.
- You know,

05:19.056 --> 05:20.926
the fresh air will do you good.

05:20.959 --> 05:23.028
It smells like rotting death in here.

05:23.061 --> 05:26.799
- Oh. I think someone's hungry.
- What are you doing? Stop it!

05:26.832 --> 05:29.168
I... told you I am fine!

05:29.200 --> 05:31.335
I am a grown man, for crying out loud!

05:31.368 --> 05:33.071
(singsongy): And you're hungry.

05:33.104 --> 05:34.439
(giggling)

05:34.472 --> 05:36.074
Ah...

05:36.107 --> 05:39.043
What's with you and all the plants?

05:39.077 --> 05:41.313
Oh, they're my friends.

05:41.345 --> 05:43.047
Your friends?

05:43.080 --> 05:45.183
- Yeah.
- (quietly): Wonderful.

05:45.217 --> 05:47.452
You know, plants make better
friends than most people.

05:47.486 --> 05:49.388
And some of them helped save your life.

05:51.989 --> 05:53.191
It's broth.

05:53.224 --> 05:55.927
I even put in some white
willow for your fever.

05:55.960 --> 05:57.328
(mug shatters)

05:57.361 --> 05:59.797
- What is wrong with you?
- For the millionth time,

05:59.830 --> 06:01.967
I need to get back to Gotham!

06:02.000 --> 06:03.335
What's the rush?!

06:03.368 --> 06:05.471
I was betrayed <i> and</i> shot.

06:05.503 --> 06:08.506
I should be plotting my
revenge, building an army,

06:08.539 --> 06:10.342
not drinking pinecone juice

06:10.375 --> 06:12.978
with the... crazy plant lady.

06:13.010 --> 06:15.080
So build an army. No one's stopping you.

06:15.113 --> 06:17.950
And I could even help
if you weren't being

06:17.982 --> 06:19.217
such a jerk.

06:19.251 --> 06:20.385
Jerk.

06:21.986 --> 06:23.289
Fine.

06:25.157 --> 06:27.226
I need you to deliver a message

06:27.258 --> 06:28.960
to Gabe.

06:28.993 --> 06:31.095
Who's Gabe?

06:31.128 --> 06:33.097
He's a moron.

06:33.130 --> 06:35.868
But... he is a loyal moron.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.535
And every army starts

06:37.568 --> 06:40.806
with one single loyal soldier.

06:46.143 --> 06:48.313
"Please."

06:49.880 --> 06:51.849
(whispering): Please?

06:51.883 --> 06:53.252
Okay.

06:53.284 --> 06:54.953
Fine.

07:15.207 --> 07:17.409
Thank you for meeting me.

07:17.441 --> 07:19.210
Why here?

07:20.311 --> 07:22.580
It's public, open,

07:22.614 --> 07:25.551
easy to spot if anyone's watching us.

07:25.584 --> 07:28.554
The driver who hit my father's
car that night wasn't drunk.

07:28.587 --> 07:30.421
I think he did it on purpose,

07:30.455 --> 07:32.890
and someone made it
look like an accident.

07:32.924 --> 07:35.327
Easy enough for the Court.

07:35.359 --> 07:39.030
So let's say I believe you.

07:39.063 --> 07:42.034
What do you want from me?

07:42.066 --> 07:43.936
I have just learned something

07:43.969 --> 07:46.904
I am still having trouble believing.

07:46.938 --> 07:50.909
A weapon is en route, headed for Gotham.

07:50.941 --> 07:53.578
A weapon the Court intends
to use to destroy the city.

07:53.611 --> 07:55.614
What are you talking about?

07:55.647 --> 07:57.182
You said the Court controls Gotham.

07:57.215 --> 07:58.916
Why would they want to destroy it?

07:58.950 --> 08:00.919
This isn't the Court as a whole.

08:00.952 --> 08:03.922
It's limited to a number
of high-ranking members,

08:03.955 --> 08:06.925
fanatics who believe the
city needs to be cleansed.

08:06.957 --> 08:08.960
And you really think
they're capable of this?

08:08.993 --> 08:10.595
They've done it before.

08:10.628 --> 08:13.631
Twice in the city's history
they've laid waste to Gotham.

08:13.664 --> 08:16.068
It's no bluff.

08:16.101 --> 08:18.337
So how do we stop it?

08:18.369 --> 08:20.104
I have no idea.

08:20.138 --> 08:22.940
I don't even know what the weapon is.

08:22.974 --> 08:25.142
But that's exactly what
I'm going to find out.

08:25.176 --> 08:26.945
- I can help.
- No. The Court knows

08:26.977 --> 08:28.646
I reached out to you, but that's all.

08:28.679 --> 08:30.348
We need to keep it that way,

08:30.381 --> 08:32.551
in case I'm discovered.

08:34.251 --> 08:36.589
Be careful, Uncle Frank.

09:05.416 --> 09:07.386
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to intrude.

09:07.418 --> 09:08.986
I saw you earlier.

09:09.019 --> 09:12.423
Who was that man you were with?

09:12.456 --> 09:14.992
My Uncle Frank.

09:15.026 --> 09:18.195
I thought you two were estranged.

09:18.229 --> 09:19.998
We recently reconnected.

09:20.031 --> 09:23.068
Good for you.

09:25.036 --> 09:27.672
(Thompkins sighs) I've
been coming here a lot.

09:27.705 --> 09:30.041
The other day I saw this...

09:30.075 --> 09:32.544
little old man, must
have been in his 90s,

09:32.576 --> 09:34.145
all dressed up,

09:34.179 --> 09:36.281
standing in front of his wife's grave...

09:36.314 --> 09:38.150
smiling.

09:38.182 --> 09:41.653
I couldn't understand what
there was to smile about.

09:45.223 --> 09:47.392
And then it occurred to me.

09:49.326 --> 09:52.096
They shared a whole life together.

09:55.466 --> 09:57.635
I'm sorry.

10:00.070 --> 10:02.574
How do you do that?

10:02.607 --> 10:05.043
How do you just... move on,

10:05.075 --> 10:08.247
leaving so much
destruction in your wake?

10:13.218 --> 10:15.521
I wish I could do that.

10:19.224 --> 10:21.493
(phone buzzing)

10:24.495 --> 10:26.197
- Yeah?
- BULLOCK: Hey.

10:26.230 --> 10:28.099
That driver that hit and
killed your father that night

10:28.133 --> 10:29.100
was a career scumbag.

10:29.133 --> 10:30.335
What'd you find out?

10:30.368 --> 10:32.470
He did a stretch for grand theft auto,

10:32.503 --> 10:34.071
among other things, and get this...

10:34.104 --> 10:35.606
the high-priced lawyer
who got him his plea

10:35.639 --> 10:39.378
was paid for by none other
than Carmine Falcone.

10:48.373 --> 10:50.262
- (laughing)
- (strained): Okay, that's... easy. Okay.

10:50.264 --> 10:51.866
Okay, that's enough.

10:51.899 --> 10:53.268
(grunts, laughs)

10:53.301 --> 10:55.738
Oh, Boss, I can't believe it.

10:55.771 --> 10:57.245
You know that everyone
thinks you're dead.

10:57.247 --> 10:59.697
- Yes.
- And that Barbara's running things?

10:59.699 --> 11:01.878
Gabe, this might go faster
if you just listen.

11:01.989 --> 11:03.324
I need to build an army

11:03.356 --> 11:05.225
to exact my revenge,

11:05.259 --> 11:06.826
and to take back my throne.

11:06.860 --> 11:08.276
Will you help me?

11:08.278 --> 11:10.214
Of course I will. When the guys hear

11:10.246 --> 11:11.981
that you're still alive,
they'll come running.

11:12.014 --> 11:13.082
I'll make sure of it.

11:13.115 --> 11:14.651
What do you want me to do?

11:14.684 --> 11:16.619
That.

11:16.653 --> 11:18.622
I want you to do that, Gabe.

11:18.654 --> 11:20.223
Right. I got it.

11:20.256 --> 11:21.558
No problem.

11:23.125 --> 11:24.962
Hey...

11:24.995 --> 11:28.131
Um... there's something <i> off</i> about him.

11:28.164 --> 11:29.399
No argument there.

11:29.433 --> 11:30.500
I don't trust him.

11:30.534 --> 11:32.403
Gabe?

11:32.436 --> 11:35.506
He's a human Labrador. You
whistle, he comes running.

11:35.538 --> 11:36.539
Trust me, he's loyal.

11:36.572 --> 11:38.375
I have this perfume.

11:38.408 --> 11:42.012
One whiff, and a man
will do anything I ask.

11:42.044 --> 11:43.413
Including telling the truth.

11:43.447 --> 11:45.416
Look, now that Gabe is here,

11:45.448 --> 11:47.650
I'm afraid this is where we part ways.

11:47.683 --> 11:49.285
I have an army to build,

11:49.318 --> 11:51.421
a war to plan,

11:51.455 --> 11:54.258
and we really do not know
each other that well.

11:54.290 --> 11:56.526
You understand.

11:56.559 --> 11:58.027
No.

11:58.061 --> 12:01.398
Maybe you can ask one of your plants.

12:01.431 --> 12:03.567
I do not trust you.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.034
I saved your life.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.569
My men are on their way.

12:06.602 --> 12:08.005
You trust him?

12:08.038 --> 12:09.406
But I...

12:09.438 --> 12:11.308
I thought we were friends.

12:11.341 --> 12:13.277
(snorts) Friends?

12:13.309 --> 12:14.678
(chuckling): Friends.

12:14.711 --> 12:17.181
Oh.

12:17.213 --> 12:19.048
You're being serious.

12:19.082 --> 12:21.452
Look, don't take this the wrong way,

12:21.485 --> 12:24.654
but you are a bit of a freak.

12:28.457 --> 12:29.592

12:29.625 --> 12:31.428

12:31.461 --> 12:33.364
Yeah.

12:35.197 --> 12:37.101

Everything is a maze, Bruce.
The only difference

14:31.806 --> 14:34.993

You have some nerve showing up here.

15:13.801 --> 15:15.503
We need to talk. Alone.

15:15.536 --> 15:16.771
No, we don't.

15:16.804 --> 15:18.173
You took my son from me.

15:18.205 --> 15:20.908
And you took my father away from me.

15:20.942 --> 15:22.911
I'd say that makes us even.

15:22.944 --> 15:24.646
Your father was killed
by a drunk driver.

15:24.679 --> 15:26.048
No, he wasn't.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.049
The driver wasn't drunk.
He hit us on purpose.

15:28.083 --> 15:31.453
But I think you know that because
you paid for his lawyer.

15:33.121 --> 15:35.857
Still think we have
nothing to talk about?

15:41.228 --> 15:43.198
If you have a question for me, son...

15:43.231 --> 15:45.234
why not go ahead and ask it?

15:45.266 --> 15:47.835
Did you order the hit on my father?

15:47.868 --> 15:49.070
No.

15:49.103 --> 15:51.105
I respected your father.

15:51.139 --> 15:54.109
Much more than the son he left behind.

15:54.141 --> 15:55.576
But someone did.

15:55.610 --> 15:56.745
It was a hit?

15:58.246 --> 15:59.881
Yes.

16:01.882 --> 16:04.085
The Court of Owls.

16:04.118 --> 16:06.954
What do you know about them?

16:06.987 --> 16:09.558
I know my uncle is a member.

16:09.591 --> 16:11.593
- Are you?
- No.

16:11.626 --> 16:13.996
But we've built a
partnership which has been

16:14.029 --> 16:16.231
mutually beneficial over the years.

16:16.264 --> 16:17.866
You mean you do their bidding.

16:17.899 --> 16:20.269
Everyone does the Court's bidding.

16:20.301 --> 16:22.603
Some of us just know it.

16:22.636 --> 16:24.839
The person who came to you...

16:24.872 --> 16:26.775
a member of the Court?

16:27.909 --> 16:29.144
Yes.

16:29.176 --> 16:30.611
Who was it?

16:30.645 --> 16:34.149
Who ordered the hit on my father?

16:34.181 --> 16:36.084
I want a name.

16:39.187 --> 16:41.757
Frank Gordon.

16:41.790 --> 16:44.626
Your uncle.

16:44.659 --> 16:45.794
(door closes)

16:58.206 --> 17:00.609
Hello, Jim.

17:00.642 --> 17:01.945
Thought we could use a drink.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.159
Is it true?

17:08.193 --> 17:11.363
Did you order the hit on my father?

17:11.396 --> 17:14.300
Carmine called the Court after you left.

17:14.332 --> 17:15.915
You shouldn't have gone there.

17:15.945 --> 17:17.147
It'll raise suspicions.

17:17.180 --> 17:19.717
Is it true?

17:21.417 --> 17:24.055
Yes.

17:26.123 --> 17:27.358
Why?

17:27.391 --> 17:28.994
I already told you...

17:29.026 --> 17:31.261
your father was determined
to expose the Court

17:31.294 --> 17:32.831
and became a risk.

17:32.863 --> 17:33.898
Simple as that.

17:33.930 --> 17:35.232
So you had him killed?

17:35.265 --> 17:36.735
Your own brother?

17:36.767 --> 17:38.369
You want to shoot me, Jim?

17:38.402 --> 17:39.837
You'd be doing me a favor.

17:39.870 --> 17:41.372
But it won't change anything.

17:41.406 --> 17:43.207
The only thing we can do now

17:43.241 --> 17:46.177
is finish what Peter started
and bring down the Court.

17:46.209 --> 17:47.379
It's what he would have wanted.

17:47.411 --> 17:48.912
What my father would have wanted

17:48.946 --> 17:50.948
is for justice to be done.

17:53.918 --> 17:56.120
So do I.

17:56.154 --> 17:57.856
Frank Gordon, you're under arrest

17:57.889 --> 17:59.991
for the murder of Peter Gordon.
Turn around.

18:00.023 --> 18:01.793
Turn around!

18:01.825 --> 18:03.060
Have you not been listening?

18:03.093 --> 18:04.662
You have the right to remain silent.

18:04.696 --> 18:06.164
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

18:06.196 --> 18:07.998
- in a court of law.
- Arrest me

18:08.032 --> 18:09.768
- and it's over.
- You have the right to an attorney.

18:09.801 --> 18:10.935
Stopping them is the
only thing that matters.

It's all I've been able to find out.

18:25.449 --> 18:28.018
I need to speak with the
Court, try to buy some time.

18:28.052 --> 18:30.088
You need to find out when the
weapon will be arriving,

18:30.120 --> 18:31.755
and you need to do it without the Court

18:31.789 --> 18:33.091
finding out you're involved.

18:33.123 --> 18:37.027
Otherwise... we're both dead.

18:37.061 --> 18:38.764
Make a choice, Jim.

18:40.997 --> 18:42.967
(door opens, closes)

18:50.975 --> 18:52.944
I didn't think you had it in you.

18:52.976 --> 18:54.478
I know.

18:54.512 --> 18:56.915
You never did.

18:56.947 --> 18:58.917
Oh, boo-hoo.

18:58.949 --> 19:01.052
Is that what this is about?

19:01.084 --> 19:04.054
No one gave you a gold
star for thuggery?

19:04.088 --> 19:07.024
If you're gonna kill me,
then get on with it already.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.796
I ain't gonna kill you.

19:12.830 --> 19:15.033
We're gonna auction off that right

19:15.065 --> 19:17.968
to the highest bidder.

19:18.002 --> 19:19.971
(car approaches outside)

19:20.004 --> 19:21.473

19:21.505 --> 19:24.374
That would be my sales force.

19:24.408 --> 19:25.976
(car doors open)

19:45.162 --> 19:48.532
If he had just listened to me, but no.

19:48.565 --> 19:50.501
Nobody listens to Ivy...

19:55.106 --> 19:56.742

19:58.341 --> 19:59.777
BULLOCK: <i> Whoa.</i>

19:59.811 --> 20:01.111
That's a lot to take in.

20:01.145 --> 20:02.847
Tell me about it.

20:02.879 --> 20:05.783
A secret organization that
controls all of Gotham?

20:05.816 --> 20:07.551
If that's true, somebody should tell 'em

20:07.584 --> 20:09.853
they're doing a pretty terrible job.

20:09.887 --> 20:11.523
He told you all this at the cabin?

20:11.555 --> 20:14.391
Most of it. The weapon
intended to destroy the city...

20:14.425 --> 20:16.860
that's a new wrinkle
he threw at me today.

20:16.894 --> 20:18.864
Quite the family reunion you're having.

20:20.564 --> 20:23.400
I didn't mean to involve
you in all this,

20:23.434 --> 20:25.904
I just don't know who to trust anymore.

20:25.937 --> 20:27.272
Way I see it, as hard as it was

20:27.304 --> 20:29.139
to hear what Falcone had to say,

20:29.173 --> 20:32.143
at least he confirmed the
existence of the Court.

20:32.176 --> 20:34.212
So I take my uncle at his word?

20:34.244 --> 20:35.479
You work the lead.

20:35.513 --> 20:37.081
Check the docks. But that's just me.

20:37.113 --> 20:39.483
I tend to give apocalyptic warnings

20:39.516 --> 20:43.086
of mass destruction the
benefit of the doubt.

20:43.119 --> 20:45.889
But it wasn't my father who was killed.

20:45.923 --> 20:49.093
So if you want to go after
your uncle for what he did,

20:49.126 --> 20:51.196
I got your back.

20:52.964 --> 20:54.499
He says the Court has destroyed the city

20:54.532 --> 20:56.301
twice before in its history.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.202
We can't take that chance.

20:58.235 --> 21:00.103
I'll call Judge Bam Bam, get a warrant.

21:00.137 --> 21:02.607
We'll hit the docks and start
kicking in doors today.

21:02.639 --> 21:05.176
No. He was very clear.
The Court can't know

21:05.208 --> 21:07.578
I'm looking into this. The
GCPD cannot be involved.

21:07.611 --> 21:10.047
So who do we know who can raid the docks

21:10.081 --> 21:11.582
who won't raise questions

21:11.616 --> 21:14.219
and isn't connected to the GCPD?

No. No, no, no, no, no.

25:31.105 --> 25:32.841
(groaning)

25:34.308 --> 25:35.809
(chuckles)

25:35.843 --> 25:37.979
Torture is fun.

25:38.011 --> 25:40.214
However, I need to know

25:40.248 --> 25:42.551
what is coming into dock 9C.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.554
I told you, there is no dock 9C.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.588
- I can't tell you what I don't...
- What you don't know.

25:47.622 --> 25:49.591
Yes, I've heard that one.

25:49.624 --> 25:52.227
Now tell me something I haven't heard.

25:52.260 --> 25:55.696
You don't know what they're capable of.

25:55.730 --> 25:57.566
Even when Don Falcone
was running things,

25:57.598 --> 26:01.035
he never asked questions
about what came into 9C.

26:01.068 --> 26:03.605
In case you haven't heard,

26:03.637 --> 26:07.841
Don Falcone ain't running things, baby.

26:07.875 --> 26:10.111
- Now, what is coming...
- (groaning)

26:10.144 --> 26:13.714
into dock 9C?

26:13.748 --> 26:17.285
Something already came in last week,

26:17.318 --> 26:19.287
- but they picked it up. Okay?
- Oh?

26:19.319 --> 26:22.256
The crate, it's still over there.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.125
I swear, that's all I know.

26:25.158 --> 26:26.594
I swear.

26:26.627 --> 26:30.130
So, you must have a phone number

26:30.164 --> 26:33.033
to alert them when things arrive.

26:33.067 --> 26:34.769
Huh? What do you say

26:34.801 --> 26:37.338
we give 'em a little call?

26:37.372 --> 26:41.009
'Cause I would love an introduction.

26:41.041 --> 26:42.243
- (clang)
- (wings flapping)

26:54.856 --> 26:57.125
- (metal blade ringing)
- (man screams)

27:12.272 --> 27:14.308
Get him!

27:14.341 --> 27:16.744
(automatic gunfire)

27:34.695 --> 27:35.730
I-I swear,

27:35.762 --> 27:37.765
I didn't tell her nothin'!

27:42.235 --> 27:44.405
GABE: Make sure you get
him from all sides.

27:44.439 --> 27:48.076
Potential bidders need to know
that he's alive and well.

27:48.108 --> 27:50.077
Once we get these delivered,

27:50.110 --> 27:51.212
the auction can begin.

27:51.244 --> 27:53.814
Forgot these in the car.

27:53.847 --> 27:55.215
Cannolis from Alberto's, boss.

27:55.249 --> 27:57.385
Thank God. I'm starved.

27:57.417 --> 28:00.387
Alberto's are my favorite...

28:00.421 --> 28:04.726
Looks like you got yourself
into quite the pickle.

28:04.759 --> 28:06.227
You're sitting right next to me.

28:06.260 --> 28:08.395
I think our fates are
somewhat intertwined.

28:08.429 --> 28:10.298
Oh, no. I'll be fine.

28:10.330 --> 28:12.900
What? What are you talking about?

28:12.933 --> 28:14.735
Totally fine.

28:14.769 --> 28:16.904
If you have a plan, tell me.

28:16.937 --> 28:18.739
Tell me.

28:18.772 --> 28:20.375
What? You want me to beg? Is that it?

28:20.407 --> 28:22.309
I want you to be nice to me.

28:22.343 --> 28:23.378
Nice to you?

28:23.411 --> 28:24.913
Yes! Is that so much to ask?

28:24.945 --> 28:26.246
No.

28:26.279 --> 28:27.981
No, it's not.

28:28.014 --> 28:30.217
Okay, I'll be nice. I promise.

28:31.285 --> 28:32.253
Now, what is your plan?

28:32.286 --> 28:33.254
Lay it on me.

28:33.287 --> 28:36.257
Watch and learn.

28:36.289 --> 28:39.159
Oh, yoo-hoo. Canolli guy.

28:39.193 --> 28:40.962
Hey, quick question.

28:44.898 --> 28:46.867
If I had information,

28:46.901 --> 28:49.003
like, really good information

28:49.036 --> 28:52.006
that would get you a ton
more money for Penguin,

28:52.039 --> 28:53.974
would you let me go?

28:55.041 --> 28:56.744
I don't know. Maybe.

28:56.778 --> 28:57.912
What is it?

28:57.944 --> 29:01.215
Oh, I can't tell you in front of...

29:01.249 --> 29:03.785
Let me whisper it in your ear.

29:08.222 --> 29:10.125
Do you like my perfume?

29:11.459 --> 29:12.394
(inhales)

29:18.098 --> 29:19.867
You'll do anything I ask?

29:21.335 --> 29:22.303
Super.

29:22.336 --> 29:23.270
Kill them all.

29:27.107 --> 29:28.510
(gunshots)

29:28.542 --> 29:29.376
Wait!

29:29.410 --> 29:30.345
Stop!

29:30.377 --> 29:32.079
Get his gun.

29:32.113 --> 29:33.314
Grab the gun!

29:33.347 --> 29:35.282
(chuckling)

29:36.850 --> 29:37.818
Give it to me.

29:37.852 --> 29:39.320
Give it to him!

29:39.353 --> 29:40.789
And tell him to untie us.

29:40.821 --> 29:41.856
Untie us!

29:41.888 --> 29:42.856
You don't have to yell.

29:42.889 --> 29:44.057
(giggles) Sorry.

29:44.090 --> 29:46.026
I just got so caught up in the moment.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.433
(gunshot)

29:53.366 --> 29:55.336
You know,

29:55.368 --> 29:58.338
I like the idea of an auction, Gabe.

29:58.372 --> 30:00.975
I think I'll auction you off to myself.

30:01.008 --> 30:04.813
Piece by bloody piece.

30:04.846 --> 30:07.816
(distant traffic sounds)

30:07.848 --> 30:09.349
Carmine told us Jim came to him

30:09.383 --> 30:12.520
asking questions about
his father's death.

30:12.552 --> 30:14.521
What exactly does he know?

30:14.555 --> 30:17.091
Only what Carmine knew.

30:17.124 --> 30:19.928
That I gave the order
to have Peter killed.

30:21.261 --> 30:23.964
Nothing can lead back to the Court.

30:23.998 --> 30:25.500
After all these years,

30:25.532 --> 30:28.535
why would he start
looking into this now?

30:28.568 --> 30:32.473
I don't know. Believe me, this
is the last thing I wanted.

30:34.275 --> 30:36.244
Which is why I'm here.

30:36.277 --> 30:38.179
I know my nephew.

30:38.212 --> 30:41.516
Jim won't stop until one of us is dead.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.917
Unfortunate.

30:43.951 --> 30:47.521
He would have made a powerful
ally in what lies ahead.

30:47.555 --> 30:49.289
In that case,

30:49.323 --> 30:51.359
you know what you have to do.

30:52.492 --> 30:55.963
James Gordon must be killed.

31:01.603 --> 31:03.906
- Barbara called.
- What'd she say?

31:03.938 --> 31:05.773
Apparently, dock 9C is being guarded

31:05.807 --> 31:08.510
by a blade-wielding psychopath
who almost killed them.

31:08.542 --> 31:10.779
Of course it is. Did she find
out if anything was coming in?

31:10.811 --> 31:12.180
That's the thing,

31:12.213 --> 31:14.515
it already has.

31:14.549 --> 31:17.053
I thought your uncle said the weapon
wasn't in the city yet. He did.

31:17.085 --> 31:18.921
Which means either he's
lying or he didn't know.

31:18.953 --> 31:21.956
Either way, we have to assume
the Court already has it.

31:21.990 --> 31:24.526
- We still don't even know what "it" is.
- We know one thing.

31:24.559 --> 31:26.194
Barbara said the crate that she saw

31:26.228 --> 31:27.963
was stamped with Indian Hill.

31:27.995 --> 31:30.064
So something from the freak factory

31:30.097 --> 31:31.799
is gonna wipe out the city?

31:31.832 --> 31:34.602
(phone buzzing)

31:40.575 --> 31:41.809
Gordon.

31:41.843 --> 31:43.212
FRANK: We need to talk.

31:43.244 --> 31:45.546
Did you know the weapon is here?

31:45.579 --> 31:46.814
What? No.

31:46.847 --> 31:48.817
What the hell is going on, Frank?

31:48.849 --> 31:49.818
We're running out of time.

31:49.850 --> 31:50.985
I'm at my house.

31:51.019 --> 31:52.721
Come alone and come quickly.

31:52.753 --> 31:54.022
(phone clicks)

31:57.858 --> 32:00.128
(panting)

32:01.997 --> 32:03.832
I trusted you, Gabe.

32:03.865 --> 32:06.568
And how did you repay that loyalty?

32:06.600 --> 32:08.236
Betrayal.

32:08.270 --> 32:10.972
Not for nothing,

32:11.005 --> 32:13.107
but I was there after
your mother was killed

32:13.141 --> 32:14.843
when no one else was.

32:14.876 --> 32:16.712
And how'd you repay me?

32:16.744 --> 32:18.847
By passing me over.

32:18.879 --> 32:21.116
Wow.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.718
A valid point.

32:23.751 --> 32:26.120
Perhaps we forget that loyalty

32:26.154 --> 32:29.991
must be extended before
it can be returned.

32:30.024 --> 32:31.993
Yeah.

32:32.027 --> 32:34.863
You were loyal to me once, Gabe.

32:34.895 --> 32:36.865
I wonder, could you be again?

32:36.897 --> 32:39.001
Yes! Oh, boss.

32:39.033 --> 32:43.004
I'd swear an oath on my dead
mother's grave right now.

32:43.038 --> 32:44.606
God rest her soul.

32:44.638 --> 32:46.741
No need for anything so dramatic.

32:46.774 --> 32:49.610
Ivy, would you mind ensuring

32:49.644 --> 32:53.549
that Gabe's oath of loyalty
is noble and true?

32:56.184 --> 32:58.753
If what is what now?

32:58.787 --> 33:00.756
Make him smell your perfume.

33:00.789 --> 33:02.958
Right. Okay.

33:05.193 --> 33:07.628
(sniffing)

33:07.662 --> 33:10.299
Um, raise your right hand.

33:10.331 --> 33:12.900
Do you swear

33:12.934 --> 33:15.937
to be loyal and true to Penguin?

33:17.204 --> 33:19.674
No.

33:19.707 --> 33:21.776
Ouch.

33:21.809 --> 33:24.847
I don't understand. Why not?
Why can't he be loyal?

33:26.080 --> 33:27.815
Go ahead, answer.

33:27.848 --> 33:30.318
I never was.

33:30.351 --> 33:32.653
I only followed you out of fear.

33:32.686 --> 33:34.655
We all did.

33:34.688 --> 33:37.191
Actually, I can live with that.

33:37.224 --> 33:40.928
Fear and respect... management 101.

33:40.962 --> 33:42.664
No one ever respected you.

33:42.696 --> 33:46.702
We always saw you for
what you really are.

33:46.734 --> 33:50.204
A tiny freak who used
to hold an umbrella.

33:50.238 --> 33:51.907
Nothing more.

33:53.241 --> 33:55.644
A freak?

33:56.877 --> 33:58.847
A... freak?

34:00.714 --> 34:02.617
A <i> freak?!</i>

34:06.855 --> 34:07.956
No!

34:07.989 --> 34:08.489
A freak!

34:08.523 --> 34:10.858
A freak! A <i> freak!</i>

34:10.891 --> 34:12.226
(laughing)

34:12.259 --> 34:14.695
(Oswald yelling, blows landing)

34:14.728 --> 34:16.964
(yelling echoing)

34:16.998 --> 34:18.766
(door closes)

34:26.741 --> 34:29.378
Thanks for coming.

34:29.411 --> 34:31.847
The weapon the Court is planning

34:31.880 --> 34:35.717
to use on Gotham came from Indian Hill.

34:35.750 --> 34:38.119
Any idea what it might be?

34:38.152 --> 34:40.021
No.

34:40.054 --> 34:43.724
Like I said, I had no idea
that it had already arrived.

34:43.757 --> 34:46.328
It's clear that the Court
no longer trusts me.

34:49.297 --> 34:51.934
Then why call me down here?

34:54.768 --> 34:57.372
I'm supposed to kill you.

34:58.907 --> 35:02.277
Which leaves us... where?

35:02.309 --> 35:05.146
That's up to you.

35:05.179 --> 35:07.882
I need someone to replace
me on the Court.

35:07.916 --> 35:10.184
Someone who can find
out what the weapon is

35:10.217 --> 35:12.420
and how to stop it.

35:12.454 --> 35:14.722
Someone I can trust.

35:17.058 --> 35:19.761
You need to join the Court of Owls, Jim.

35:19.793 --> 35:21.896
It's the only way.

35:21.929 --> 35:24.331
You just said they want me dead.

35:24.364 --> 35:26.333
They still want you on the Court.

35:26.367 --> 35:28.804
They just don't seen
now how it's possible,

35:28.837 --> 35:30.905
but I do.

35:30.938 --> 35:33.908
At some point, a woman named

35:33.942 --> 35:35.777
Kathryn is going to call

35:35.809 --> 35:38.212
to ask if you are dead.

35:38.246 --> 35:40.782
And when she does,

35:40.815 --> 35:43.217
I suggest you pick up.

35:43.250 --> 35:45.453
And tell her what?

35:45.487 --> 35:47.088
That you blame me for
your father's death.

35:47.121 --> 35:48.956
I gave the order to have him killed,

35:48.989 --> 35:50.324
and I deserved what I got.

35:50.358 --> 35:52.060
What are you talking about?

35:52.092 --> 35:53.328
You have his strength, Jim.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.797
You can finish what he started.

35:56.831 --> 35:59.334
For both of us.

35:59.367 --> 36:02.471
He would have been so proud of you.

36:02.503 --> 36:05.273
No!

36:11.077 --> 36:14.680
(thud, door creaks and whirs open)

36:17.293 --> 36:19.730
(Bruce grunts)

36:22.432 --> 36:24.436
(Bruce groaning)

36:26.872 --> 36:29.408
Please! Please. I'm sorry.

36:29.439 --> 36:30.708
I'll do whatever you want.

36:30.740 --> 36:32.744
Just please don't make me go back there!

36:40.885 --> 36:42.087
Give me your money!

36:47.458 --> 36:50.427
(groans, thuds)

36:50.461 --> 36:51.629
(gasps)

37:01.371 --> 37:03.774
No!

37:16.487 --> 37:18.755
(grunting)

37:18.789 --> 37:22.260
(wind whipping, grunts)

37:26.764 --> 37:27.664
(yells)

37:29.532 --> 37:30.701
(gasps)

37:32.503 --> 37:34.639
(groans)

37:34.671 --> 37:37.675
(panting)

37:41.945 --> 37:44.414
(panting)

37:47.784 --> 37:52.389
I have so much to teach you, Bruce.

37:52.423 --> 37:54.492
But your pain...

37:54.525 --> 37:57.662
it blocks you from who
I need you to become.

37:57.695 --> 38:01.733
Who Gotham needs you to become.

38:05.668 --> 38:07.671
(gasps loudly)

38:07.704 --> 38:10.674
(panting)

38:19.617 --> 38:22.943
If one's feelings and
emotions are strong enough,

38:22.945 --> 38:28.218
their consequences can follow
you back into the real world.

38:28.726 --> 38:32.463
I don't know what you want from me.

38:34.033 --> 38:36.770
Over the centuries, we've
tried to end the cycle

38:36.803 --> 38:39.873
of crime and violence
that plagues Gotham,

38:39.906 --> 38:43.009
only for it to start up again.

38:43.042 --> 38:45.212
And do you know why it does?

38:47.681 --> 38:50.785
People are afraid.

38:52.319 --> 38:56.056
And fear breeds hopelessness.

38:56.089 --> 38:59.794
I'm supposed to believe you care
about the people of Gotham?

38:59.826 --> 39:02.162
I do.

39:02.196 --> 39:04.665
Very much.

39:04.698 --> 39:07.634
Which is where you come in.

39:07.667 --> 39:10.203
Gotham needs something I believe

39:10.236 --> 39:13.574
only you can provide.

39:14.841 --> 39:16.676
What?

39:16.710 --> 39:20.615
A protector, Bruce.

39:22.716 --> 39:25.819
I can't protect Gotham.

39:25.853 --> 39:27.922
Not by myself. No one can.

39:27.955 --> 39:29.790
Perhaps.

39:29.823 --> 39:32.692
But if you were to become a symbol,

39:32.725 --> 39:36.196
a symbol against fear,

39:36.230 --> 39:40.134
then Gotham can be reborn.

39:46.373 --> 39:50.845
Okay, I admit it.

39:50.877 --> 39:53.713
I might have lost my
temper there a little bit.

39:53.746 --> 39:55.882
Sorry about that.

39:55.915 --> 39:58.084
It's okay.

39:58.118 --> 40:01.355
I don't know why I let him get to me.

40:01.388 --> 40:03.090
Sticks and stones, right?

40:03.123 --> 40:04.825
Hmm.

40:04.857 --> 40:08.028
Words always hurt me way
more than sticks or stones.

40:09.295 --> 40:12.699
Yeah. Me, too.

40:12.732 --> 40:16.169
So does this mean you're giving
up your plans for revenge?

40:16.203 --> 40:19.840
I can't take on Nygma and Barbara

40:19.873 --> 40:21.976
and the rest of them by myself.

40:22.009 --> 40:24.978
Who said anything about
taking them on by yourself?

40:25.011 --> 40:27.113
Selina told me some pretty crazy stories

40:27.147 --> 40:29.150
about people she met
down in Indian Hill.

40:29.183 --> 40:32.018
Said you wanted to build an army, right?

40:32.051 --> 40:33.887
Well,

40:33.920 --> 40:38.025
what about an army of freaks?

40:40.294 --> 40:43.364
What kind of freaks?

40:54.774 --> 40:57.944
(phone ringing)

41:04.183 --> 41:06.152
(phone beeps on)

41:06.185 --> 41:08.288
Kathryn, I presume.

41:08.321 --> 41:09.923
KATHRYN: Detective Gordon.

41:09.957 --> 41:11.926
I can't say I'm entirely surprised.

41:11.958 --> 41:13.294
I killed my uncle.

41:13.326 --> 41:15.029
I make no apologies for it.

41:15.062 --> 41:16.429
We understand.

41:16.462 --> 41:19.466
Good. Maybe it's time we meet.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.902
Agreed.

41:21.935 --> 41:24.471
