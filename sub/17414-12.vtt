WEBVTT

00:03.584 --> 00:05.378
There's only one piece
left to clean up.

00:05.379 --> 00:07.275
Perry. Chuck has to kill him.

00:07.276 --> 00:09.187
You are giving him
his red test tonight?

00:09.234 --> 00:11.268
<i>u kidding me? Kill him here, now?</i>

00:11.336 --> 00:12.336
<i>I can't do that.</i>

00:12.337 --> 00:14.237
Then you won't become a spy.

00:16.242 --> 00:19.187
You passed the test.
To them you killed perry.

00:19.222 --> 00:22.008
No one can know the truth ever.
Not even sarah.

00:22.043 --> 00:23.839
You're now officially an agent.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.549
Included there's a plain ticket to
washington, you'll leave tonight.

00:31.608 --> 00:34.810
<i> First day. Don't be nervous.
Don't be nervous.</i>

00:41.218 --> 00:45.788
What floor? Five.

00:45.856 --> 00:47.890
No, not five.

00:52.295 --> 00:54.897
Oh, hey, uh,
I'm so sorry to bother you.

00:54.965 --> 00:56.966
You wouldn't happen to know what
floor General Beckman is on?

00:57.034 --> 00:58.634
They told me at the front desk

00:58.635 --> 00:59.969
and I-I just totally forgot.

00:59.970 --> 01:01.537
You couldn't miss her.
She's real little,

01:01.538 --> 01:02.571
lots of medals, red hair.

01:02.572 --> 01:03.706
Nice, nice, friendly conversation.

01:03.707 --> 01:05.474
That's good. I'm glad we did that.

01:05.474 --> 01:07.375
No!

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.621 --> 01:18.954
Sir?

01:18.955 --> 01:20.589
Excuse me, sir.

01:20.590 --> 01:22.258
This is a restricted floor.

01:22.259 --> 01:24.727
I need a badge and a signature.

01:27.564 --> 01:29.765
Sir, I can't let you examine a body

01:29.833 --> 01:33.335
without an authorized NSA badge.

01:33.403 --> 01:35.171
Would you do me a favor?

01:35.172 --> 01:37.239
Just... one step.

01:38.809 --> 01:39.809
There, perfect.

01:39.810 --> 01:41.577
What do you think you're doing?!

02:11.108 --> 02:13.509
It's done.

02:13.577 --> 02:15.644
Package is intact.

02:15.712 --> 02:17.613
NSA, General Beckman's office.
Please hold.

02:17.681 --> 02:20.950
NSA, General Beckman's office.
Please hold.

02:21.017 --> 02:22.885
Thank you for waiting.

02:22.886 --> 02:26.088
Here we are. Thank God.

02:26.156 --> 02:27.690
Hello. Thank you for waiting.

02:27.691 --> 02:28.991
How's it going?

02:28.992 --> 02:31.627
NSA, General Beckman's office.
Please hold.

02:32.662 --> 02:33.929
Super.

02:33.930 --> 02:36.198
Thank you for waiting.

02:36.266 --> 02:38.200
Hello. Thank you for waiting.

02:38.268 --> 02:39.535
Yes, I'll put you right through.

02:39.536 --> 02:41.003
Excuse me. Hi, my name's...

02:41.004 --> 02:42.404
Have a seat, Agent Bartowski.

02:42.405 --> 02:44.073
The General knows you're here.

02:44.074 --> 02:45.808
NSA.

02:45.809 --> 02:50.980
Right. Yeah, of course
she knows I'm here.

02:51.047 --> 02:53.516
NSA, General Beckman's office.
Please hold.

02:54.551 --> 02:56.318
Oh, God, these things are

02:56.319 --> 02:57.319
incredibly uncomfortable.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.354
Is there a particular place

02:58.355 --> 02:59.455
that you like to put this?

02:59.456 --> 03:00.389
'Cause I'm always having...

03:00.390 --> 03:02.191
Oh, right, yes.

03:02.192 --> 03:04.894
Sorry about... Finger
always on the slide,

03:04.961 --> 03:06.862
and you know, totally empty so...

03:06.930 --> 03:08.464
But I hear you. Safety first.

03:08.465 --> 03:10.699
A pleasure as always, General.

03:10.767 --> 03:13.335
The pleasure's all mine, Diane.

03:13.403 --> 03:15.137
Mr. Bartowski. Oh!

03:15.138 --> 03:16.906
For God's sake,

03:16.907 --> 03:19.575
put that gun away.
You're a spy now.

03:19.643 --> 03:21.510
Well, that's, that's
actually what I wanted

03:21.511 --> 03:23.279
to talk to you about, General.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.647
Your first assignment just arrived.

03:24.648 --> 03:26.982
The CIA wants you
in Rome right away.

03:27.050 --> 03:29.018
Uh, what? Excuse me, right away?

03:29.085 --> 03:30.719
Mm-hmm. You will be posing

03:30.720 --> 03:32.688
as a independently
wealthy young expatriate.

03:32.756 --> 03:34.990
That way, your
jet-setting lifestyle

03:35.058 --> 03:37.326
and influential associates
won't draw attention.

03:37.394 --> 03:39.995
Here is where you'll be staying.

03:40.063 --> 03:42.364
Uh, wow.

03:42.432 --> 03:43.632
Obviously, you will be afforded

03:43.633 --> 03:45.100
all the accoutrements
that go with it:

03:45.101 --> 03:47.436
cars, clothes, a yearly stipend.

03:47.504 --> 03:49.238
Huh? What? Yearly?

03:49.239 --> 03:51.707
Yearly stipend?

03:51.775 --> 03:54.510
This is all moving very,
very fast, don't you think?

03:54.578 --> 03:57.613
The NSA has spent three years

03:57.681 --> 03:59.215
and countless millions of dollars

03:59.216 --> 04:00.616
helping you reach your potential.

04:00.617 --> 04:02.418
There's nothing fast about it.

04:02.419 --> 04:03.686
I get that. I do.

04:03.687 --> 04:05.287
I do, General,
and I certainly don't

04:05.288 --> 04:06.388
want to come across

04:06.389 --> 04:07.923
as being ungrateful for the,
the villa

04:07.924 --> 04:09.892
or the car or the stipend.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.962
I'm just not sure
that I am really ready

04:13.029 --> 04:14.929
to pack up and move
somewhere to live

04:14.965 --> 04:17.266
this whole new life

04:17.334 --> 04:19.368
when I'm just starting
to become comfortable

04:19.435 --> 04:23.138
with the life I'm living...
right now, you know?

04:23.206 --> 04:25.241
What exactly did you think

04:25.308 --> 04:29.211
we were training you for, Mr.
Bartowski?

04:29.279 --> 04:34.250
I don't... I don't really
know what to say, General.

04:34.317 --> 04:35.884
I'm sorry.

04:35.885 --> 04:37.785
Is not an option!

04:41.958 --> 04:47.096
I understand that the hand-wringing

04:47.163 --> 04:51.500
and the second-guessing are
all part of your process.

04:51.568 --> 04:54.003
Here's what I'm offering:

04:54.070 --> 04:57.673
take the week off,
anywhere you want, on us.

04:57.741 --> 04:59.975
But afterwards, I expect

05:00.043 --> 05:02.845
you back in Washington and
ready to assemble your team.

05:02.912 --> 05:03.912
Is that understood?

05:03.913 --> 05:06.815
Hang on. Um, back up a second.

05:06.883 --> 05:08.784
What do you mean by

05:08.852 --> 05:10.819
"my" team?

05:10.887 --> 05:13.589
You didn't think we were going
to send you to Rome alone?

05:13.657 --> 05:16.492
You'll have your pick
of our top agents,

05:16.559 --> 05:19.094
whoever you want.

05:19.162 --> 05:21.563
So where will we be sending you,
Mr. Bartowski?

05:21.631 --> 05:22.931
Bali? Bora Bora?

05:22.932 --> 05:24.832
Burbank.

05:24.834 --> 05:27.503
 Bob Hope Airport, to be exact.

05:27.570 --> 05:29.471
I see.

05:29.539 --> 05:32.207
And will you be requiring
a companion ticket?

05:32.275 --> 05:34.175
No, thanks.

05:35.211 --> 05:38.480
She's still there.

05:38.481 --> 05:43.819
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

06:19.809 --> 06:22.944
That's, uh, that's
fantastic news. Okay.

06:23.012 --> 06:24.912
Thank you.

06:28.451 --> 06:31.886
Enough of the su3pense, babe.

06:31.954 --> 06:34.255
One word, Devon: Africa.

06:34.323 --> 06:35.657
Africa?

06:35.658 --> 06:36.891
That was the hospital.

06:36.892 --> 06:38.159
I didn't even have to ask.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.828
Out of the blue,
they just offered me

06:39.829 --> 06:42.030
a sabbatical. I have a year off.

06:42.098 --> 06:43.965
Do you know what that means?

06:43.966 --> 06:46.167
Africa.

06:46.235 --> 06:48.169
We can do Doctors without Borders,

06:48.237 --> 06:49.270
follow our dreams,

06:49.271 --> 06:50.271
whatever you want.

06:50.272 --> 06:51.806
What about Chuck?

06:51.807 --> 06:53.475
Chuck is moving on, you know?

06:53.476 --> 06:55.376
I really believe that this time.

06:55.444 --> 06:57.145
He said he was on a business trip

06:57.146 --> 06:58.379
for Buy More in Washington.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.014
Yeah, yeah,
he did sound pretty pumped

07:00.015 --> 07:01.082
when I talked to him.

07:01.083 --> 07:01.950
Who knows where

07:01.951 --> 07:03.851
he'll end up. Who knows?

07:03.853 --> 07:05.153
Honey, there's nothing
keeping us here.

07:14.697 --> 07:16.798
Africa.

07:16.866 --> 07:18.833
I've never had to win
a girl back, buddy,

07:18.901 --> 07:21.402
so I stopped by the
store on the way here.

07:21.470 --> 07:23.171
I got Sarah a bunch of stuff.

07:23.172 --> 07:25.240
What do you think?
Am I overdoing it? Hmm-mmm.

07:25.307 --> 07:28.143
You think I'm overdoing it.
I'm overdoing it.

07:28.210 --> 07:31.679
Well, the chocolates are
a nice touch, I guess,

07:31.747 --> 07:33.381
t buy her back,

07:33.382 --> 07:34.449
if that makes any sense.

07:34.450 --> 07:36.251
I know, I know, you're right.

07:36.252 --> 07:38.520
It just finally clicked
for me, you know?

07:38.587 --> 07:39.988
Sarah is, is the
most important thing.

07:39.989 --> 07:41.589
I mean, what's the point
of being a spy without her?

07:41.590 --> 07:43.158
I've got to win her back,

07:43.159 --> 07:45.393
and I've only got a small window
of opportunity to do it in

07:45.461 --> 07:47.162
before I have to leave for Rome.

07:47.163 --> 07:52.167
Hey. Did you just say
you're gonna go to Rome?

07:52.234 --> 07:53.768
Yeah, my new assignment
starts there next week.

07:53.769 --> 07:55.870
Then you are still leaving.
Thank God!

07:55.938 --> 07:57.205
I just fed Ellie some story

07:57.206 --> 07:58.606
about you working for
Buy More corporate.

07:58.607 --> 08:00.108
She won't go to Africa
if you're still here.

08:00.109 --> 08:01.843
Well, I'm not going
anywhere without Sarah.

08:01.844 --> 08:03.511
Then let's get you two
kids back together.

08:03.512 --> 08:04.979
Shouldn't be too difficult, huh?

08:04.980 --> 08:07.148
You seen the stallion she's dating?

08:07.216 --> 08:08.249
Casey, do you...?

08:08.250 --> 08:11.019
Do, do you ever
knock or use a door?

08:11.086 --> 08:12.687
Shaw's not some geek who likes

08:12.688 --> 08:15.323
to talk about his feelings all
day long. He's a real spy.

08:15.391 --> 08:17.225
Oh. Oh, really? Is that so?

08:17.226 --> 08:19.928
Well, apparently, you haven't
heard because you no longer work

08:19.995 --> 08:21.229
for the United States government,

08:21.230 --> 08:24.032
but I'm heading up my own
undercover operation.

08:24.099 --> 08:26.367
In Rome. And I get to
choose my own team.

08:26.435 --> 08:28.970
Really? Anyone?

08:29.038 --> 08:31.072
Including a civilian with
extensive military background?

08:31.140 --> 08:32.140
Take a number, Casey.

08:32.140 --> 08:33.741
Chuck, I speak fluent Italian.

08:33.741 --> 08:35.043
Menu items mostly.

08:35.044 --> 08:36.510
I'd be an invaluable asset.

08:36.511 --> 08:38.645
Listen, guys, I got to
get Sarah back first.

08:38.714 --> 08:39.914
Then we can start
talking about a team.

08:39.914 --> 08:41.149
What are we waiting for, fellas?

08:41.150 --> 08:42.383
Let's help the guy get
his girl back. Come on!

08:42.384 --> 08:44.219
Yeah, so Ellie and
I can go to Africa.

08:44.220 --> 08:45.486
And I can get out of Burbank.

08:45.487 --> 08:46.554
I can finally go see Rome.

08:46.555 --> 08:48.223
Maybe meet a nice Italian girl.

08:48.224 --> 08:51.192
See the Vatican...
pay my respects to the Pope.

08:51.260 --> 08:54.863
What are you waiting for,
lover boy?

08:57.566 --> 08:59.834
Hey, um...

08:59.902 --> 09:00.902
You're back.

09:00.903 --> 09:01.936
I've been calling you

09:01.937 --> 09:03.504
for, for a couple days now.

09:03.505 --> 09:05.607
You know, there's a lot
we need to talk about.

09:05.674 --> 09:08.443
I know. I'm sorry.

09:08.510 --> 09:09.544
It's been a little...

09:09.545 --> 09:10.645
Crazy. Yeah, I know.

09:10.646 --> 09:12.513
Beckman flew me to D.C.

09:12.514 --> 09:14.414
I got my badge. It's official now.

09:14.416 --> 09:15.416
I'm an agent.

09:15.417 --> 09:17.385
Congratulations. You earned it.

09:17.453 --> 09:19.787
You know the CIA-
they're sending me to Italy.

09:19.855 --> 09:22.290
You wouldn't believe the villa
that they're putting me up in.

09:22.358 --> 09:25.360
I'm supposed to be some
rich young playboy.

09:25.427 --> 09:26.995
But who cares about that?

09:26.996 --> 09:28.496
The point is, Sarah...

09:28.497 --> 09:30.798
I want you to go with me.

09:30.866 --> 09:33.101
Chuck, I can't.

09:33.168 --> 09:35.303
No, Beckman said I get
to choose my own team,

09:35.371 --> 09:36.804
cream of the crop. That's you.

09:36.805 --> 09:38.705
I'm going to Washington,
okay? And I'm going with Shaw.

09:38.707 --> 09:40.875
Wait a minute.

09:40.943 --> 09:43.177
Wasn't this the plan?

09:43.245 --> 09:44.445
There's nothing stopping us

09:44.446 --> 09:45.613
from being together now.

09:45.614 --> 09:46.981
I passed my spy test.

09:46.982 --> 09:48.850
That's why I can't
be with you, okay?

09:48.851 --> 09:50.351
You're not...
you're not the same guy

09:50.352 --> 09:51.486
that I fell for.

09:51.487 --> 09:53.254
How? Why? Because I'm an agent now?

09:53.255 --> 09:54.889
How am I not the same guy?

09:54.890 --> 09:57.358
You killed somebody, Chuck.
I saw you kill the mole!

10:03.065 --> 10:09.003
Sarah, I know what you think
you saw on the train tracks,

10:09.071 --> 10:11.205
but it's not that simple.

10:11.273 --> 10:12.807
It's more complicated than that.

10:12.808 --> 10:16.811
and I need you to believe me.

10:16.879 --> 10:19.280
I don't.

10:19.348 --> 10:23.184
I hope I'm not interrupting.

10:24.553 --> 10:27.855
Congratulations on your promotion,

10:27.923 --> 10:30.458
Special Agent Bartowski.

10:30.526 --> 10:33.194
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Yeah, it's, uh...

10:33.262 --> 10:35.029
it's very exciting.

10:35.030 --> 10:37.198
So what brings you back to Burbank?

10:37.266 --> 10:41.536
Um... I, uh,

10:41.603 --> 10:43.304
you know, just, uh,

10:43.305 --> 10:45.006
just-just tying up
a few loose ends.

10:45.007 --> 10:46.507
Actually, Chuck was just wondering

10:46.508 --> 10:48.710
if I had any last-minute advice

10:48.777 --> 10:50.677
on his new assignment in Rome.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.780
Well, you shouldn't
have come to her.

10:55.517 --> 10:56.884
You should have come to me.

10:56.885 --> 10:58.586
I was stationed
there for two years.

10:58.587 --> 11:00.822
Come on. I can tell you
everything you need to know.

11:00.889 --> 11:02.789
Oh, great.

11:13.802 --> 11:16.004
Hey.

11:17.072 --> 11:18.006
How'd it go with Walker?

11:18.007 --> 11:19.374
Because she thinks
I killed the mole,

11:19.375 --> 11:21.442
she believes I'm no longer the
guy she fell in love with.

11:21.510 --> 11:22.744
I have to tell her the truth.

11:22.745 --> 11:24.512
What? That I killed him?
Not gonna happen.

11:24.513 --> 11:26.413
Casey, you said it yourself.
The guy was a traitor.

11:26.448 --> 11:28.383
Yeah, well, according
to Beckman, so am I.

11:28.450 --> 11:30.284
I'm lucky she didn't put
a bullet in my head.

11:30.285 --> 11:31.853
Get her back some other way.

11:31.854 --> 11:33.121
Well, what the heck am I
supposed to tell Sarah?

11:33.122 --> 11:35.456
Tell her whatever you want,
just not the truth.

11:35.524 --> 11:37.425
You like being a
full-fledged spy, don't you?

11:37.493 --> 11:40.728
You like that nice villa the CIA
picked out for you in Rome, hmm?

11:40.796 --> 11:43.531
Then you killed the mole.
That's how it's got to be.

11:43.599 --> 11:45.266
Okay, okay.

11:45.267 --> 11:46.634
How did it go? How did it go?

11:46.635 --> 11:47.668
Crashed and burned.

11:47.669 --> 11:48.836
Chuck, did you tell
her how you feel?

11:48.837 --> 11:50.671
Forget it.

11:50.672 --> 11:52.572
She's leaving with
Shaw in the morning.

11:52.608 --> 11:53.841
I'm sorry, guys. It's over.

11:53.842 --> 11:55.510
I'm going to get some fresh air,

11:55.511 --> 11:57.812
and figure out how I'm going
to tell Beckman I'm quitting.

12:00.783 --> 12:03.184
There goes our chance to
ever get out of the Buy More.

12:03.252 --> 12:06.154
Really? Is that what they
teach you in the Marine Corps?

12:06.221 --> 12:07.221
Hmm?

12:07.222 --> 12:08.289
Roll over and die?

12:08.290 --> 12:09.857
This isn't exactly combat, Morgan.

12:09.858 --> 12:11.526
That's where you're wrong, Casey.

12:11.527 --> 12:15.163
Because love?
Love is a battlefield.

12:18.634 --> 12:19.801
Huh.

12:19.802 --> 12:20.668
Hey, fellas.

12:20.669 --> 12:22.070
Need your help.

12:22.071 --> 12:24.105
Actually, Chuck needs your help.

12:24.173 --> 12:25.640
Went and lost his
old lady again, huh?

12:25.641 --> 12:26.641
Yeah. How did you know that?

12:26.642 --> 12:27.675
We know everything.

12:27.676 --> 12:28.876
The eyes and the ears

12:28.877 --> 12:30.478
of the strip mall, my friend.

12:30.479 --> 12:33.347
Chuck better move quick if he
wants to get his froyo ho back.

12:33.415 --> 12:35.917
Another fella sniffing
around the orange.

12:35.984 --> 12:37.752
Orange.

12:37.753 --> 12:40.254
Guy knows how to fill
out a pair of slacks.

12:40.322 --> 12:41.389
If you know what I'm saying.

12:41.390 --> 12:42.490
No, I don't.

12:42.491 --> 12:43.524
I didn't notice that.

12:44.526 --> 12:45.693
You want us to put a tail

12:45.694 --> 12:46.861
on blondie's new piece?

12:46.862 --> 12:48.262
Find out his weaknesses,

12:48.263 --> 12:49.730
see what skeletons
are in his closet?

12:49.731 --> 12:51.032
Blood sample, urine?

12:51.033 --> 12:52.200
Stool?

12:52.201 --> 12:54.268
No.

12:54.336 --> 12:55.503
No, not at... I just...

12:55.504 --> 12:57.872
I just need to borrow something.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.183
Whoa! Whoa!

13:09.184 --> 13:11.185
What the crap is going on?

13:11.253 --> 13:12.920
You guys scared the
bejeezus out of me.

13:12.921 --> 13:14.455
We're here to help you
reacquire Agent Walker.

13:14.456 --> 13:16.657
Guys, listen. You don't understand.

13:16.725 --> 13:18.659
No, Chuck, you don't understand.

13:18.727 --> 13:20.528
You're not the only one with
something at stake here, Chuck.

13:20.529 --> 13:22.497
Yeah, we help you
get the girl back,

13:22.564 --> 13:24.198
you help us get out of Burbank.

13:24.199 --> 13:25.600
Think of it as a test run for Rome.

13:25.601 --> 13:26.868
What do you think, boss?

13:26.869 --> 13:29.804
Hey, get dressed.
Reservation's in ten minutes.

13:29.872 --> 13:31.272
Reservation for what? Come on.

13:31.273 --> 13:33.040
Guys. Is this Jeff's van?

13:33.041 --> 13:34.041
Go, go, go!

13:39.581 --> 13:41.481
Darn, he's on the move.

13:42.584 --> 13:44.118
Guys, what are we doing here?

13:44.119 --> 13:45.386
It's Shaw's date.

13:45.387 --> 13:47.522
Wow. That guy can fill
out a pair of slacks.

13:47.589 --> 13:50.525
Sarah's with a stallion. Huh.

13:50.592 --> 13:51.826
Don't listen to him, Chuck.

13:51.827 --> 13:53.161
We have a plan.

13:53.162 --> 13:54.228
You've got nothing
to worry about, man.

13:54.229 --> 13:57.064
Target is in position, sir.

14:00.302 --> 14:02.270
Looks like a romantic dinner.

14:02.337 --> 14:04.438
Sorry, Shaw.

14:07.699 --> 14:10.267
1990 Chateau Latour.
Excellent choice.

14:10.335 --> 14:11.335
Thank you.

14:11.336 --> 14:13.804
Knowledge of fine wine.
Very classy.

14:13.872 --> 14:16.307
He just ordered for both of them.

14:16.374 --> 14:17.808
That's a power move, bro.

14:17.809 --> 14:19.443
Yeah. Guy's a closer.

14:19.444 --> 14:20.778
Guys, guys.

14:20.779 --> 14:23.781
A little sensitivity would
really go a long way.

14:23.848 --> 14:26.383
Just a smidgeon. A skosh. A dab.

14:26.451 --> 14:27.718
We're talking about

14:27.719 --> 14:29.619
the girl I love here.

14:32.757 --> 14:34.158
I'm sorry.

14:34.159 --> 14:35.559
What could you
possibly be sorry for?

14:35.560 --> 14:36.794
This is amazing.

14:36.795 --> 14:38.128
It's just...

14:38.129 --> 14:40.297
I'm sorry that we haven't
done this sooner.

14:40.365 --> 14:42.132
This is nice.

14:42.133 --> 14:44.033
No, it's perfect.

14:44.069 --> 14:46.070
Being here with you.

14:47.639 --> 14:49.840
To a new life and a fresh start.

14:49.908 --> 14:52.242
No Burbank, no baggage.

14:52.310 --> 14:54.044
All right, this isn't good.

14:54.045 --> 14:55.913
Why doesn't John here just
drag him out of there?

14:55.914 --> 14:59.450
I'm afraid my days of legalized
body snatching are over, guys.

14:59.517 --> 15:00.718
I'm a civilian now.

15:00.719 --> 15:02.653
This one's on you, Bartowski.

15:02.721 --> 15:04.555
All right, Chuck. Whatever you do,
do not go in there too hot.

15:04.556 --> 15:05.589
You will scare her away.

15:05.590 --> 15:07.124
Negative. Okay?

15:07.125 --> 15:08.726
Chuck has to lay
it all on the line.

15:08.727 --> 15:09.893
Shaw, he may be
handsome and worldly

15:09.894 --> 15:10.994
and know his way around a menu,

15:10.995 --> 15:12.895
but, man, he's stiff as a board.

15:12.897 --> 15:14.398
Where's that Bartowski charm?

15:14.399 --> 15:16.266
The pizzazz? You flash a smile,

15:16.267 --> 15:17.634
you go in there and you...

15:17.635 --> 15:19.269
Morgan, why don't you
let me handle it? Okay?

15:19.270 --> 15:21.238
No offense, but I've had
my fair share of ladies.

15:21.306 --> 15:22.573
'Cause you live in a bubble.

15:22.574 --> 15:23.907
Okay? Take a look at yourself.

15:23.908 --> 15:24.975
Go ahead.

15:24.976 --> 15:27.211
It's a freakish bubble
of handsomeness.

15:27.278 --> 15:28.912
Now, look at me.

15:28.913 --> 15:30.180
No bubble. No bubble.

15:30.181 --> 15:31.181
I got to be completely verbal.

15:31.182 --> 15:32.416
Now, Chuck, I'm telling you,

15:32.417 --> 15:34.251
you just go in and you
be fun and you be witty,

15:34.252 --> 15:35.619
and you be the charming
guy she fell for.

15:35.620 --> 15:36.620
Yeah?

15:36.621 --> 15:38.288
Okay. Okay, fine.

15:38.289 --> 15:39.456
But what about Shaw?

15:39.457 --> 15:41.357
Just worry about the girl.

15:41.393 --> 15:44.261
I'll take care of the stallion.

15:53.104 --> 15:56.039
Sorry to disturb you, but, Mr.
Shaw, you have a phone call.

16:01.780 --> 16:03.881
Target's on the move.

16:06.084 --> 16:08.285
DEEP VOICE Agent Shaw.

16:08.353 --> 16:10.154
I'm an operative of The Ring.

16:10.155 --> 16:11.822
If you want to save everyone

16:11.823 --> 16:13.724
in this restaurant, you will listen

16:13.792 --> 16:15.526
to my instructions very carefully.

16:15.527 --> 16:17.628
You will do everything that I say.

16:22.033 --> 16:23.834
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

16:23.835 --> 16:26.470
Exit the restaurant. Side door.

16:26.538 --> 16:28.438
And head to the back alley.

16:30.842 --> 16:33.177
We've lost visual on the target.

16:33.244 --> 16:36.313
Bring up the phone dub.

16:36.381 --> 16:38.549
DEEP VOICE Stay cool and
nobody will get hurt.

16:38.616 --> 16:40.617
Who the hell is that?

16:49.260 --> 16:50.294
Is this seat taken?

16:50.295 --> 16:52.596
Chuck, what are you doing here?

16:57.168 --> 16:58.735
I'm here for you.

16:58.736 --> 17:00.604
What do you want me to say?

17:00.605 --> 17:03.173
I want you to say that
u'll come with me to Rome.

17:03.241 --> 17:05.141
Well, you know that I can't,
and you know why.

17:05.143 --> 17:08.412
Look, Sarah, I don't want
to have to make a scene

17:08.480 --> 17:09.946
in front of all these very
nice people, but I will

17:09.948 --> 17:11.281
literally do anything
to change your mind.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.317
Well, then tell me what really
happened at the train tracks.

17:13.384 --> 17:15.752
If you didn't kill the mole,
then who did?

17:15.819 --> 17:19.323
Look, I don't want
there to be any secrets

17:19.390 --> 17:20.723
or lies between us, ever again.

17:20.724 --> 17:23.359
So, please,
let me just have this one.

17:23.428 --> 17:27.231
And I promise I will
never lie to you.

17:29.067 --> 17:31.168
There you will head to a pay phone.

17:31.236 --> 17:33.604
The southwest corner. Do it.

17:33.671 --> 17:36.273
But do it slowly.

17:36.341 --> 17:37.908
DEEP VOICE Slowly.

17:37.909 --> 17:40.577
Not one of ours.

17:40.645 --> 17:43.380
Take him down.

17:44.616 --> 17:46.750
We know exactly what
you look like, Shaw.

17:46.818 --> 17:50.754
6'2", 220, black hair,

17:50.822 --> 17:52.722
very attractive.

17:56.995 --> 17:59.429
Next move, you're to
wait for a phone call.

18:00.532 --> 18:02.132
Might not happen right away.

18:02.133 --> 18:04.735
So be patient.
And then, when you...

18:06.471 --> 18:07.638
Do you have any idea
who these people are?

18:07.639 --> 18:08.672
What they're capable of?

18:08.673 --> 18:09.873
Mm-mmm. Nope?

18:09.874 --> 18:11.275
Listen.

18:11.276 --> 18:14.745
I know that you think
I'm not that same guy

18:14.812 --> 18:16.280
that you met the first
day at the Buy More.

18:16.281 --> 18:18.582
And you know what? You're right.

18:18.650 --> 18:19.850
Okay? You're right.

18:19.851 --> 18:21.685
The guy that I was
back then hated himself

18:21.686 --> 18:23.453
for not knowing what he wanted
to do with the rest of his life

18:23.454 --> 18:25.556
or who he wanted to
spend it with, but now?

18:26.925 --> 18:29.760
Finally, now... I know.

18:31.596 --> 18:33.697
I want to be a spy.

18:33.765 --> 18:35.665
And I want to be with you.

18:38.202 --> 18:39.469
Hey, it's just a harmless prank.

18:39.470 --> 18:41.305
Listen, you have to understand...

18:41.306 --> 18:42.706
Who are they?

18:42.707 --> 18:43.840
Is that a taser?

18:43.841 --> 18:45.375
Sorry about this. Oh, boy.

18:57.055 --> 18:58.589
Sarah.

18:58.590 --> 18:59.990
Man down.

18:59.991 --> 19:00.991
I've been tased.

19:00.992 --> 19:02.559
I can't feel my legs.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.460
Bring a stretcher, a wheelbarrow.

19:05.530 --> 19:07.430
Possible change of pants.

19:07.999 --> 19:09.600
Casey, you got to do something.

19:09.601 --> 19:11.201
He's gunning for Chuck.

19:11.202 --> 19:12.703
I'm a civilian now. I can't.

19:12.704 --> 19:14.938
Well, I can.

19:15.773 --> 19:17.673
Daniel.

19:20.144 --> 19:21.778
If you're going to shoot me,
just do it.

19:21.779 --> 19:22.846
Put a bullet in my head.

19:22.847 --> 19:24.548
Bullet?

19:24.549 --> 19:26.883
The director wants to meet
with you face to face.

19:26.951 --> 19:28.785
What are you saying?

19:28.786 --> 19:31.922
Sarah, I'm saying... that I...

19:43.668 --> 19:46.203
Next time, take out
the guy with the gun.

19:50.487 --> 19:52.020
Jail? Seriously, you guys? Jail?

19:52.021 --> 19:53.188
I mean, Morgan,

19:53.189 --> 19:54.590
I would have expected
this from you.

19:54.591 --> 19:56.625
Or even from Casey,

19:56.693 --> 19:57.993
now that we have all been privy

19:57.994 --> 19:59.194
to your public indecency problem.

19:59.195 --> 20:02.297
<i>But, Devon, I never expected
this from you.</i>

20:02.365 --> 20:03.832
No, babe. I am so sorry.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.367
You know what?

20:05.368 --> 20:06.368
Just save the apology. Okay?

20:06.369 --> 20:07.770
I want answers.

20:07.771 --> 20:10.139
I want the truth. I want you
guys to tell me everything.

20:10.206 --> 20:11.707
The truth?

20:11.708 --> 20:13.608
Yes.

20:15.345 --> 20:16.411
The truth is...

20:16.412 --> 20:17.646
We were, uh, helping Chuck.

20:17.647 --> 20:19.047
Chuck is in D.C., Casey.

20:19.048 --> 20:22.751
Well, he was. He's back
to win back Sarah, so...

20:22.819 --> 20:24.353
Hold on for a minute.

20:24.354 --> 20:27.289
You guys expect me to believe
that the three of you

20:27.357 --> 20:29.625
got my husband beat
up and tossed in jail

20:29.692 --> 20:31.560
to save my brother's love life?

20:31.561 --> 20:32.995
Yes. Yes, we did.

20:32.996 --> 20:34.229
We're as shocked as you are.

20:34.230 --> 20:35.631
And, what's more,

20:35.632 --> 20:38.801
Chuck came to you three for advice.

20:38.868 --> 20:40.002
Before me.

20:40.003 --> 20:41.570
Yeah. Yes, he did.

20:41.571 --> 20:43.038
Why am I not surprised
this ended in jail?

20:44.340 --> 20:46.508
Agent Shaw, we have
just received intel

20:46.576 --> 20:48.410
that the Ring agent who
tried to capture you

20:48.411 --> 20:50.445
is the same man who
removed a data drive

20:50.513 --> 20:52.147
from inside the mole's body.

20:52.148 --> 20:54.016
The data was inside him?

20:54.017 --> 20:56.018
He was in the process of
digesting it when he was killed.

20:56.085 --> 20:58.020
I'll spare you the gory details.

20:58.087 --> 20:59.822
Lucky he was dead first.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.256
We believe the stolen data drive

21:01.257 --> 21:03.192
contains highly
sensitive case files.

21:03.259 --> 21:05.427
Your new mission is to
bring back those files.

21:05.495 --> 21:06.728
General, if I may,

21:06.729 --> 21:08.330
it's not good enough.

21:08.331 --> 21:09.598
Excuse me, Agent Shaw.

21:09.599 --> 21:10.966
You have a better idea?

21:10.967 --> 21:13.001
The Ring agent we encountered
did not want to kill me.

21:13.069 --> 21:14.969
He wanted to take
me to the director.

21:15.004 --> 21:17.472
If the Ring wants to take me,
let them.

21:17.540 --> 21:19.675
You're volunteering
to be a double agent?

21:19.742 --> 21:21.243
I'm volunteering
to be a bull's-eye.

21:21.244 --> 21:23.612
I'll paint a target on
the Ring from within.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.514
I can get close to the director
and track his location.

21:25.515 --> 21:26.682
And then what?

21:26.683 --> 21:27.916
It's your call, General,

21:27.917 --> 21:29.817
but I'd suggest you
launch an air strike.

21:30.620 --> 21:32.921
Shouldn't we stop and ask

21:32.989 --> 21:34.790
what the Ring wants with
you in the first place?

21:34.791 --> 21:36.358
And why they want you alive?

21:36.359 --> 21:37.593
It doesn't matter.

21:37.594 --> 21:40.295
We can decimate the
Ring's command structure

21:40.363 --> 21:41.964
with a single mission.

21:41.965 --> 21:43.365
I see the merits.

21:43.366 --> 21:45.334
But you do recognize the danger?

21:45.401 --> 21:46.602
General.

21:46.603 --> 21:48.537
This is the moment I've
been waiting for...

21:48.605 --> 21:50.505
we've been waiting for.

21:50.573 --> 21:52.473
A singular opportunity.

21:52.508 --> 21:54.243
Whatever the risk may be,

21:54.244 --> 21:55.344
I say it's worth it.

21:55.345 --> 21:56.411
Very good.

21:56.412 --> 21:58.814
Make it work.

21:58.882 --> 22:00.616
Are you trying to
get yourself killed?

22:00.617 --> 22:02.885
You're asking if I'd trade my life

22:02.952 --> 22:05.087
for the man who killed my wife?

22:06.322 --> 22:08.957
I would.

22:10.093 --> 22:11.727
Well, what if I don't let you?

22:11.728 --> 22:13.061
It's not your choice.

22:20.236 --> 22:21.803
Hello?

22:21.804 --> 22:23.305
This is Daniel Shaw.

22:23.306 --> 22:25.407
I believe you've
been looking for me.

22:25.475 --> 22:27.375
I'm ready to come in.

22:29.712 --> 22:31.612
It's done.

22:34.183 --> 22:36.718
Ellie, hey.

22:36.786 --> 22:38.453
Um, look, I can explain.

22:38.454 --> 22:40.355
Chuck, listen to me. No.
I know exactly what you're going to say.

22:40.423 --> 22:41.423
And you're absolutely right.

22:41.424 --> 22:42.424
It was completely immature of me

22:42.425 --> 22:43.425
to get everyone involved like that.

22:43.426 --> 22:44.826
Chuck, you're not listening.

22:44.827 --> 22:45.894
Stupid? Maybe stupid's the
word you're looking for.

22:45.895 --> 22:46.962
I get it. I went too far.

22:46.963 --> 22:48.864
You didn't go far enough, Chuck.

22:48.932 --> 22:51.266
Sarah is special. I know it.

22:51.334 --> 22:53.302
You know it. If you love her,
if she's the one,

22:53.369 --> 22:55.470
then you don't stop.
You don't quit.

22:55.538 --> 22:57.806
You never go too far.

22:59.442 --> 23:01.276
You are a Bartowski, Chuck.

23:01.277 --> 23:03.345
Start acting like one.

23:11.921 --> 23:14.089
Shaw, please.
You're moving too fast.

23:14.157 --> 23:15.524
You're not thinking this through.

23:15.525 --> 23:17.125
Hey, we're spies, Walker.

23:17.126 --> 23:18.327
Let's start acting like it.

23:18.328 --> 23:20.228
But you don't have to do this.

23:20.263 --> 23:22.130
There's got to be another way.

23:22.131 --> 23:24.633
It's the only way to be sure.

23:24.701 --> 23:26.501
I have to do this.

23:26.502 --> 23:28.402
I'm sorry.

23:37.981 --> 23:40.882
Hey.

23:45.488 --> 23:47.956
What's that?

23:48.024 --> 23:50.092
It's how you'll find me.

23:50.159 --> 23:52.961
This will give Beckman the
coordinates for the air strike.

23:58.401 --> 23:59.434
Wow.

23:59.435 --> 24:01.335
You just...

24:01.337 --> 24:02.938
You just swallowed
that thing whole, huh?

24:02.939 --> 24:04.940
No-No water to wash it down.

24:08.578 --> 24:10.478
Take care of her, Chuck.

24:18.721 --> 24:20.088
Uh...

24:20.089 --> 24:21.356
Where is he going?

24:21.357 --> 24:23.257
Shaw is turning himself
in to the Ring.

24:23.292 --> 24:25.727
He's leading us to them.

24:25.795 --> 24:29.398
He's sacrificing himself, Chuck.

24:31.768 --> 24:33.668
Oh.

24:36.472 --> 24:37.773
I never should have let Morgan

24:37.774 --> 24:39.474
lay his dirty little
hands on Loretta.

24:39.475 --> 24:41.375
She's a sweet van, my friend.

24:41.411 --> 24:43.278
That van's my retirement, dude.

24:43.279 --> 24:45.380
And they took the van
and they left us.

24:45.448 --> 24:47.215
That is a slap in the face.

24:47.216 --> 24:48.850
It's insulting.

24:48.851 --> 24:52.054
Do they have any idea how much
stalking experience I have?

24:52.121 --> 24:53.288
If only they did, Jeffrey.

24:53.289 --> 24:54.589
You're very prolific.

24:54.590 --> 24:57.759
You're the-the Picasso
of creepiness.

24:57.827 --> 25:01.196
It's true. And this
is my Blue period.

25:04.634 --> 25:06.601
Good. There's the guy.

25:10.706 --> 25:12.474
Blondie's new boyfriend.

25:12.475 --> 25:14.375
We need to demonstrate our worth.

25:14.377 --> 25:16.545
Show them that we can stalk
with the best of them.

25:16.612 --> 25:18.246
What do you say, my friend?

25:18.247 --> 25:21.049
Let's do the dizzle.

25:22.485 --> 25:25.187
Shaw's going on a suicide mission?

25:25.254 --> 25:26.555
I don't care what he says.

25:26.556 --> 25:28.557
I am not letting him go in alone.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.035
He's not going in alone.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.640
Chuck, what are you doing?

25:45.641 --> 25:46.808
Shaw needs help.

25:46.809 --> 25:48.076
I know he does.

25:48.077 --> 25:49.578
And that's why I'm going
in to bring him back.

25:49.579 --> 25:51.079
But the air strike is on its way.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.581
You're both going to get killed.

25:52.582 --> 25:55.250
Why are you helping him?

25:57.353 --> 25:59.554
'Cause I know how much
you care about him.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.514
Glad you could make it.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.083
The director's expecting you.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.021
Be cool.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.556
You think he saw us?

26:30.557 --> 26:32.457
Never.

26:32.559 --> 26:35.060
Frisk him.

26:37.264 --> 26:39.198
Stalkee is behind a gray van

26:39.266 --> 26:42.334
with another male,
possibly for a sexual encounter.

26:42.402 --> 26:44.770
Both men are physically fit.

26:44.838 --> 26:46.005
Should be lively.

26:46.006 --> 26:47.239
Jeffrey?

26:47.240 --> 26:49.140
Don't make me afraid
to be alone with you.

26:49.676 --> 26:51.644
In case you swallowed a tracker.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.512
Rather err on the side of caution.

26:56.550 --> 26:59.718
They're much quieter
when they're dead.

27:07.227 --> 27:10.162
What do we have here?

27:11.298 --> 27:13.198
Now we can go see the director.

27:37.924 --> 27:40.826
This is the exact model our
federal government uses

27:40.894 --> 27:42.794
when cleaning up hot zones.

27:44.631 --> 27:46.531
Murder investigations.

27:53.740 --> 27:56.375
So, does this model
come with any rebates?

27:59.746 --> 28:01.981
Huh?

28:04.384 --> 28:05.885
Morse code.

28:05.886 --> 28:06.919
Got to run.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.820
It's on the house.

28:23.670 --> 28:25.104
Oh. Ugh.

28:26.406 --> 28:27.706
Lester, I'm in the middle
of something right now.

28:27.707 --> 28:28.974
I can't talk.

28:28.975 --> 28:30.643
Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no.
No worries. No worries, buddy.

28:30.644 --> 28:32.011
I, too, am a little bit busy.

28:32.012 --> 28:34.580
Uh, stalking Sarah's new stallion,
as Jeffrey would say.

28:34.648 --> 28:35.614
You got to be kidding me.

28:35.615 --> 28:36.548
Hang up the phone.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.183
I've been insulted enough.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.485
Wait, wait, wait, wait! No,
no, no, no, no.

28:39.486 --> 28:41.654
You guys are stalking
Sarah's new stallion?

28:41.721 --> 28:43.122
Yes, on our off time,

28:43.123 --> 28:45.424
to show you what amateurs
you're working with.

28:45.492 --> 28:46.759
Well, can you see him right now?

28:46.760 --> 28:48.394
No, we're tucked behind a dumpster.

28:48.395 --> 28:49.662
But it did look like the Stallion

28:49.663 --> 28:50.996
and some frat guys were heading

28:50.997 --> 28:51.997
into a dingy warehouse
or something.

28:51.998 --> 28:54.366
Dude is into some kinky stuff.

28:55.535 --> 28:57.002
Okay. Listen, Lester.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.038
I need you to tell me
where you are right now.

28:59.105 --> 29:01.807
It looks like we're at the
corner of 2nd and Alvarado.

29:16.489 --> 29:18.424
Hey!

29:18.491 --> 29:20.059
Oh, thank you, Casey.

29:20.060 --> 29:21.960
I haven't used Morse code
since basic training.

29:23.363 --> 29:25.297
I use it all the time to talk
to my Marine buddies. What's up?

29:25.365 --> 29:26.732
Okay, Shaw gave himself
up to the director,

29:26.733 --> 29:27.900
and Chuck locked me in here

29:27.901 --> 29:29.134
because he knew I would
try and rescue him

29:29.135 --> 29:30.703
and Beckman's going
to bomb the location.

29:30.704 --> 29:32.204
Shaw dies an American hero.

29:32.205 --> 29:33.372
Not if I can help it.

29:33.373 --> 29:35.307
Okay, good. He's still on the move.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.009
Thank you, Casey.

29:37.010 --> 29:39.345
I'm sorry. I can't
let you stay in here.

29:42.983 --> 29:44.316
Now, Casey.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.057
Hey!

29:52.125 --> 29:53.392
Where is he?

29:53.393 --> 29:54.960
Nice to see you, too.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.862
Suspects have entered the building.

29:56.930 --> 29:58.430
That is incredible.

29:58.431 --> 30:00.265
You guys are, like, the most
amazing stalkers I've ever seen.

30:00.266 --> 30:01.967
I will tell my
grandchildren about you.

30:01.968 --> 30:04.603
Wait. Wanna borrow
some brass knuckles?

30:04.671 --> 30:06.138
Nunchuks?

30:06.139 --> 30:09.074
Uh, why would you even have...

30:09.142 --> 30:11.042
No. While I appreciate that,

30:11.044 --> 30:13.545
Jeff, very much,
I-I-I don't believe in violence.

30:13.613 --> 30:14.880
So, should they give
you a beat-down,

30:14.881 --> 30:16.448
you expect us to have your back?

30:16.449 --> 30:18.349
No, thanks. Okay. See you later.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.967
* *

30:53.253 --> 30:55.187
Oh.

30:55.255 --> 30:57.656
Here we go.

31:22.882 --> 31:25.084
Wow.

31:31.391 --> 31:33.225
Tracker's gone subterranean.

31:33.226 --> 31:35.227
Location is stabilized
and remains fixed.

31:35.295 --> 31:38.630
Agent Shaw has arrived and
the B-2 has been deployed

31:38.698 --> 31:39.898
with bunker-busters.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.233
What do you want to do?

31:41.234 --> 31:42.634
Drop the bombs.

31:42.635 --> 31:43.735
And Agent Shaw?

31:43.736 --> 31:47.606
He's a true American hero.

31:55.715 --> 31:57.850
Welcome, Daniel.

31:57.917 --> 32:01.120
I've been waiting to
meet you for a long time.

32:01.187 --> 32:04.590
If you're going to kill me,
get it over with.

32:04.657 --> 32:06.725
I don't want to kill you, Daniel.

32:06.793 --> 32:08.694
I want to educate you.

32:11.931 --> 32:13.532
What is this?

32:13.533 --> 32:15.467
A gift.

32:15.535 --> 32:17.736
The answer you've been
seeking for all these years.

32:24.110 --> 32:27.246
MAN Max, who loves you...

32:29.349 --> 32:31.249
Happy birthday.

32:31.618 --> 32:33.585
Okay, my turn. Give me the camera.

32:33.653 --> 32:35.954
Maybe it was a bad
idea to get you a video

32:36.022 --> 32:38.390
for your birthday.

32:38.458 --> 32:41.593
Come on. Now you're
just wasting tape.

32:41.661 --> 32:43.561
This is ridiculous. Happy birthday.

32:43.596 --> 32:44.863
How'd you get this?

32:44.864 --> 32:47.065
We have lots of information on Eve.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.067
Just watch, Daniel.

32:49.135 --> 32:52.137
It's time you learned the truth
about your wife's murder.

32:52.205 --> 32:55.574
Thought you might like to see
some surveillance footage

32:55.642 --> 32:57.542
from that night.

33:10.990 --> 33:12.157
No!

33:12.158 --> 33:14.393
It must be so difficult for you.

33:17.730 --> 33:21.433
You didn't think I'd
come here in person.

33:21.501 --> 33:24.102
I'll be in touch.

33:26.472 --> 33:30.542
MAN Three minutes to target.

33:36.749 --> 33:39.918
Huh. No flash necessary.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.824
Good tranqs.

33:45.825 --> 33:47.725
Freeze!

33:49.929 --> 33:52.130
Drop it.

34:49.722 --> 34:53.958
<i> We got a lock on the tracker.</i>

35:46.539 --> 35:49.107
Congratulations, Agent Walker.
We destroyed a Ring compound,.

35:49.175 --> 35:51.209
hopefully eliminating
some of their higher-ups,

35:51.277 --> 35:53.211
and you managed to
rescue Agent Shaw.

35:53.279 --> 35:55.680
Once again,
you and your team prevail.

35:55.748 --> 35:57.682
I can't take any of
the credit, General.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.984
It was all Chuck.
He saved Shaw by himself.

36:00.052 --> 36:01.119
Duly noted.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.554
Well, Agent Walker, it's been

36:02.555 --> 36:05.824
a highly memorable
three years in Burbank.

36:05.891 --> 36:07.058
I look forward

36:07.059 --> 36:09.694
to working face-to-face
with you in Washington.

36:09.762 --> 36:11.996
Have a safe flight.

36:12.064 --> 36:14.399
How's Shaw doing?

36:14.467 --> 36:16.935
He's still unconscious,

36:17.002 --> 36:19.337
but the doctors say he'll
make a full recovery,

36:19.405 --> 36:20.905
thanks to you.

36:20.906 --> 36:23.308
Well, I mean,
you know he would have

36:23.376 --> 36:24.976
done the same for me.

36:24.977 --> 36:28.346
Look, I don't want
to pester you, Sarah,

36:28.414 --> 36:30.348
or become some, some nuisance

36:30.416 --> 36:31.916
that you can't avoid.

36:31.917 --> 36:33.351
I've seen Morgan go down that road

36:33.352 --> 36:35.086
far too many times to count.

36:35.087 --> 36:37.555
And since I've already
given the fancy

36:37.623 --> 36:39.691
eloquent version of
this speech before,

36:39.759 --> 36:42.127
right now I'm just gonna
be blunt and honest.

36:44.597 --> 36:47.465
I love you.

36:47.533 --> 36:49.768
One more time just because

36:49.835 --> 36:51.636
it feels really nice to say:
I love you.

36:51.637 --> 36:52.837
I feel like I've been bottling

36:52.838 --> 36:55.039
this up forever. I love you.

36:55.107 --> 36:56.307
Chuck, you don't have...

36:56.308 --> 36:57.542
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:57.543 --> 37:00.245
I'm getting out of hand, but...

37:00.312 --> 37:02.914
Look, you were right in Prague.

37:02.982 --> 37:05.316
You and I-- we're
perfect for each other,

37:05.384 --> 37:07.919
and I want to spend the
rest of my life with you

37:07.987 --> 37:11.122
away from everyone else and
away from this spy life.

37:11.190 --> 37:14.893
Chuck, I've made a commitment,
and not just to Shaw.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.060
Don't go.

37:16.061 --> 37:18.897
Don't do it. Leave with me instead.

37:18.964 --> 37:20.665
Today at 2:00, Union Station,

37:20.666 --> 37:22.367
we go to Mexico, and after that,

37:22.368 --> 37:23.401
anywhere that you want.

37:23.402 --> 37:24.969
I would, however, like to go

37:24.970 --> 37:26.905
and see the Eiffel
Tower at some point

37:26.972 --> 37:28.039
if that's at all possible.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.073
Don't answer now.

37:29.074 --> 37:31.109
Don't say a word.

37:31.177 --> 37:33.578
I don't want to have
to convince you.

37:33.646 --> 37:37.482
I just want you to show up.

37:37.550 --> 37:40.585
I'm gonna kiss you now...

37:40.653 --> 37:42.387
if that's okay.

37:42.388 --> 37:45.290
* *

38:04.743 --> 38:06.411
I'm gonna go home to pack

38:06.412 --> 38:09.347
both summer and winter wear.

38:09.415 --> 38:13.184
I love you, Sarah Walker.

38:13.252 --> 38:15.186
I always have.

38:28.467 --> 38:31.135
WOMAN Dr. Morris, dial 183, please.

38:31.203 --> 38:33.972
Dr. Morris.

38:53.792 --> 38:55.692
This is Shaw.

39:09.642 --> 39:10.909
You got a sec?

39:10.910 --> 39:13.244
Uh, yeah, sure. Come on in.

39:18.417 --> 39:20.317
Uh, can I get you a
drink or anything?

39:20.352 --> 39:21.819
No, no, I can't stay.

39:21.820 --> 39:23.388
I just wanted to come by

39:23.389 --> 39:24.989
and tell you something
about Bartowski.

39:24.990 --> 39:27.392
Well, if you came
to plead his case,

39:27.459 --> 39:28.893
then that's really not necessary.

39:28.894 --> 39:30.194
No, he didn't send me.

39:30.195 --> 39:31.496
He doesn't know I'm here.

39:31.497 --> 39:33.965
I just wanted to tell you something

39:34.033 --> 39:36.334
in case it changed anything.

39:38.537 --> 39:40.371
He didn't kill the mole.

39:40.372 --> 39:41.806
What?

39:41.807 --> 39:44.242
I did.

39:44.310 --> 39:47.512
He didn't have the stones
to pull the trigger.

39:47.580 --> 39:49.147
The kid's not a killer.

39:49.148 --> 39:51.683
Just not wired that way.

39:51.750 --> 39:53.785
Unlike us.

39:53.852 --> 39:56.754
Just thought you should know.

39:56.822 --> 39:58.923
See you around.

39:58.991 --> 40:01.626
Casey...

40:01.694 --> 40:03.428
Yeah?

40:03.429 --> 40:06.197
Thank you.

40:09.268 --> 40:11.903
You have a nice life, Walker.

40:11.971 --> 40:15.807
* *

40:43.802 --> 40:45.069
Hey, Washington will have to wait.

40:45.070 --> 40:47.138
We have a trace on the Director.

40:47.206 --> 40:48.673
I have the details
in the car. Come on.

40:48.674 --> 40:50.174
Well, I need to call Chuck.

40:50.175 --> 40:52.644
There's no time.
You can do it from the car.

41:02.988 --> 41:05.490
Chuck, we have an urgent situation.

41:05.557 --> 41:07.859
Our forensic team was
able to recover this video

41:07.926 --> 41:09.861
from the wreckage of
the Ring's bunker.

41:09.928 --> 41:12.997
The woman is Agent Eve Shaw,
Daniel Shaw's deceased wife.

41:13.065 --> 41:14.832
Well, this is all very
touching, General,

41:14.833 --> 41:16.768
but what does it have
to do with Sarah?

41:16.835 --> 41:18.202
Keep watching.

41:18.203 --> 41:20.371
The data drive the Ring
recovered from the mole's body,

41:20.439 --> 41:22.507
we now believe it contained
footage of a red test

41:22.574 --> 41:25.276
conducted on the night
of Agent Shaw's death.

41:31.283 --> 41:33.117
That's Sarah.

41:33.118 --> 41:35.053
Sarah killed his wife.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.788
Did you know?

41:36.789 --> 41:38.189
I assure you I had no knowledge

41:38.190 --> 41:39.223
that Agent Walker was responsible

41:39.224 --> 41:40.725
for Eve Shaw's death.

41:40.726 --> 41:42.427
If Shaw has seen this...

41:42.428 --> 41:45.296
if the Ring played
him this video...

41:45.364 --> 41:47.498
Oh, my God.

41:47.566 --> 41:49.434
Oh, my God. General,
where is Sarah now?

41:49.435 --> 41:51.969
We believe she's with Agent Shaw.

41:52.037 --> 41:55.973
Do you have any idea where Agent
Shaw might have taken her?

41:57.710 --> 42:00.978
I still don't have a signal.

42:01.046 --> 42:03.881
Daniel, where are you taking us?

42:03.949 --> 42:07.485
To settle an old score.
