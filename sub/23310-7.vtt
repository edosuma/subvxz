WEBVTT

00:04.462 --> 00:06.044
Our 16-year-old son, Tom,

00:06.044 --> 00:08.628
has recently become
sexually active.

00:08.628 --> 00:10.336
-Oh, hi, Robert.
-Ah!

00:11.044 --> 00:12.253
Ella said that you
went over there

00:12.253 --> 00:13.961
and told her to stay away
from your son.

00:13.961 --> 00:14.794
She is my daughter.

00:15.086 --> 00:16.545
I don't know, maybe I am
better off on my own.

00:16.836 --> 00:18.378
FRANCES DUFRESNE:
We were here all night working,

00:18.378 --> 00:19.462
and then we figured,

00:19.462 --> 00:21.170
might as well stay
and watch the sunrise.

00:21.170 --> 00:23.336
Like a cute little indie movie,
the two of you.

00:23.587 --> 00:25.003
DIANE CLAVOWEN: Hey Frances,
how's Andrew doing?

00:25.003 --> 00:27.587
FRANCES: He's not a boyfriend.
We are just casual.

00:27.587 --> 00:29.253
-Oh, my God!

00:29.253 --> 00:30.253
It was nice meeting you.

00:30.253 --> 00:31.961
Maybe next time
you'll have your fly up.

00:31.961 --> 00:32.628
Oh--

00:33.128 --> 00:34.919
I'm not very good at
letting someone into my life.

00:34.919 --> 00:36.503
I really like you, Robbie.

00:36.503 --> 00:37.587
I like you, too.

00:38.211 --> 00:40.503
This thing...
It's not so bad, is it?

00:40.503 --> 00:41.836
Not so bad at all.

00:53.670 --> 00:55.211
Wow, dating
since high school.

00:55.211 --> 00:57.794
That's kind of amazing.
Thank you.

00:57.794 --> 00:59.670
Well, we broke up
for a few years in there.

00:59.670 --> 01:02.836
- Well, sure.
- We both had some
growing up to do.

01:02.836 --> 01:04.587
- 'Course, her version
of growing up

01:04.587 --> 01:06.670
was sleeping
with our contractor.

01:06.670 --> 01:09.211
- Well, that's awful.

01:09.211 --> 01:11.628
Yeah. I should have
seen it coming.

01:11.628 --> 01:13.670
That's kind of
an awkward skeleton
to bring up

01:13.670 --> 01:15.086
in the middle
of a cocktail party.

01:15.086 --> 01:16.670
- I've heard worse.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.003
What was the nail
in your marriage?

01:20.003 --> 01:22.170
Oh, uh...

01:22.170 --> 01:26.003
you know...
we grew apart.

01:26.003 --> 01:28.211
Typical story.

01:28.211 --> 01:31.253
- Hmm.

01:38.253 --> 01:40.336
Opening bid: $60,000?

01:40.336 --> 01:41.712
Jesus,
that's a lot of money

01:41.712 --> 01:44.086
for some dead socialite's
hairbrush.

01:44.086 --> 01:45.211
Okay.

01:45.211 --> 01:47.086
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:47.086 --> 01:51.462
Listen, Astrid Mayberry
was one of the original...

01:51.462 --> 01:54.170
- ...New York City
socialites.

01:54.170 --> 01:57.044
The real deal
with a very famous
art collection.

01:57.044 --> 01:58.712
So what you're
seeing here today

01:58.712 --> 02:01.712
are, like,
perfect little pieces
of history.

02:01.712 --> 02:04.170
Now this--
see, this is cool
right here.

02:04.170 --> 02:06.878
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God,
11-- 11:00.

02:06.878 --> 02:08.378
Look, look, look, look,
look, look, look.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.836
Skip, Skip Zakarian.

02:09.836 --> 02:11.253
- Yeah, that's the big--

02:11.253 --> 02:13.420
- The gallery owner guy,
right?
- Yeah.

02:13.420 --> 02:15.961
Okay. All right.

02:15.961 --> 02:20.836
Time for some, um...
shameless self-promotion.

02:20.836 --> 02:24.253
- Get in there.
- All right, look away.
This will not be pretty.

02:30.587 --> 02:32.503
- Wow, it's exquisite.
- Mm-hmm.

02:32.503 --> 02:35.253
The brass
with those rubies.

02:35.253 --> 02:37.753
- Definitely.

02:37.753 --> 02:40.587
- Yeah.
- If I had to guess, I'd say
it was Imperial Russian.

02:40.587 --> 02:42.420
Oh, yeah.

02:43.462 --> 02:45.628
Mr.

02:45.628 --> 02:48.003
Hi, I've-- I've wanted
to meet you

02:48.003 --> 02:49.587
for a very,
very long time.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.628
I'm Frances Everdell.

02:51.628 --> 02:53.961
- It's Skip.
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

02:53.961 --> 02:56.587
I can just, very quickly,
just share with you.

02:56.587 --> 02:58.170
When I was--
when I was 25,

02:58.170 --> 03:00.878
I had a sort of
quarter-life crisis.

03:00.878 --> 03:02.919
- I know, it's very silly,

03:02.919 --> 03:05.878
but I wandered
into your gallery

03:05.878 --> 03:07.712
when it was teeny-tiny
on Broome Street,

03:07.712 --> 03:12.378
and I just felt like
I could breathe again.

03:12.378 --> 03:13.753
- So, thank you.
- Thank you.

03:13.753 --> 03:16.295
You realize that space
is now a Forever 21.

03:16.295 --> 03:17.961
Oh. God, poor SoHo.

03:17.961 --> 03:22.961
Anyway,
I now own a small gallery
with contemporary work,

03:22.961 --> 03:27.836
and we are having
an opening on Thursday, and...

03:27.836 --> 03:30.712
if your schedule allowed,
I would be so honored--

03:30.712 --> 03:32.503
Thursday
I have a board meeting
for the Whitney.

03:32.503 --> 03:34.086
It should only take
six to eight hours.

03:34.086 --> 03:35.670
- Man: Ladies and gentlemen,

03:35.670 --> 03:38.336
the auction preview
will close in five minutes.

03:38.336 --> 03:40.503
Please take your seats
in the main gallery.

03:40.503 --> 03:42.712
- Good luck in there.
- Oh, thank you.

03:42.712 --> 03:47.420
You, too. You, too.
And bye-bye.

03:47.420 --> 03:49.878
We have to close
the sale today.

03:49.878 --> 03:51.545
We are so close.

03:54.128 --> 03:56.670
- Apple pie.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.961
The smell drives
the price up 7-10%.

03:58.961 --> 04:01.794
No, no, no, no, no.
Back away from the pie.

04:01.794 --> 04:05.794
Over here.
Bring your nostrils
into this corridor.

04:05.794 --> 04:08.170
It's like right in here.

04:08.170 --> 04:10.044
- There's like a...

04:10.044 --> 04:13.378
a stink stream
right through here.

04:14.545 --> 04:16.753
- Oh.

04:16.753 --> 04:17.919
Oh, shit, what is that?

04:17.919 --> 04:21.378
Yeah, the stink
is intensifying up here.

04:23.378 --> 04:24.712
Oh, man.

04:26.628 --> 04:28.545
- Okay, found it.

04:28.545 --> 04:30.961
- Whew.
- Oh, God!

04:30.961 --> 04:33.336
- It's either
a bloated raccoon

04:33.336 --> 04:35.003
or the neighbor's cat.

04:35.003 --> 04:36.545
Either way, it's deceased.

04:38.128 --> 04:39.753
Shit.
Okay, look.

04:39.753 --> 04:41.003
You deal with the buyer,

04:41.003 --> 04:43.378
I'll dispose
of the dead body.

04:43.378 --> 04:45.211
Okay.
Let's do this.

04:45.211 --> 04:47.378
I keep Febreze
in my trunk.

04:47.378 --> 04:48.836
All right.

04:48.836 --> 04:50.753
- Coming!
- All right, motherfucker.

04:54.211 --> 04:57.753
Hi, Katie.
Welcome back.
Come on in.

04:57.753 --> 04:59.587
And you brought
your mom.

04:59.587 --> 05:01.753
Hi, I'm Jackie.
It's lovely to meet you.

05:01.753 --> 05:03.712
- Nice to meet you.
- Come on in.

05:03.712 --> 05:07.503
Man:
"Girls in a Field"
goes for $170,000.

05:07.503 --> 05:09.170
- Too rich for my blood.

05:09.170 --> 05:11.628
The next piece
is item number 152.

05:11.628 --> 05:14.628
One of Ms. Mayberry's
most cherished pieces.

05:14.628 --> 05:16.378
A one-of-a-kind
magnifying glass

05:16.378 --> 05:18.587
dated 1910
Imperial Russia.

05:18.587 --> 05:21.545
Brass with turquoise,
rubies, and crystal inlay.

05:23.336 --> 05:25.878
Sylvia would love that.

05:25.878 --> 05:26.919
All right,
here goes nothing.

05:26.919 --> 05:29.670
And we start
the bidding at $750.

05:29.670 --> 05:31.836
- Yes!
- I see $750.

05:31.836 --> 05:33.878
Do I see $1,500?

05:33.878 --> 05:35.919
I see $1,500.
Do I see $2,000?

05:35.919 --> 05:37.878
Well, I'm out.

05:37.878 --> 05:39.462
- Yeah, of course.

05:39.462 --> 05:40.961
- Thanks a lot, Skip.
- $2,000.

05:42.670 --> 05:44.712
- I'm bidding.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.878
- You're insane.
What are you doing?

05:46.878 --> 05:48.919
Do I see $3,000?
$3,000?

05:48.919 --> 05:50.878
- I see $3,000.
- Wow.

05:50.878 --> 05:52.378
How about $3,500?

05:52.378 --> 05:54.794
$3,500

05:54.794 --> 05:58.086
- For a brass with rubies
magnifying glass going...
- Do not, do not, do not.

05:58.086 --> 05:59.878
- ...going... gone.

05:59.878 --> 06:02.836
And the magnifying glass
goes for $3,000.

06:09.128 --> 06:12.420
Fuck. What are you
grinning at, dumbass?

06:31.878 --> 06:34.503
And is this
the master bedroom
down here?

06:34.503 --> 06:36.961
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Slow down, Mama.

06:36.961 --> 06:39.211
Who's running this tour?

06:39.211 --> 06:43.336
Me. Actually,
why don't we come look
in the guest room?

06:43.336 --> 06:45.336
There's beautiful lighting
this time of day.

06:45.336 --> 06:46.503
Come on.
There we go.

06:53.670 --> 06:59.003
And last, but not least,
the master bathroom.

07:03.919 --> 07:05.462
Hello, sorry I'm late.

07:05.462 --> 07:07.128
- Oh. Hi.
- Robert DuFresne.

07:07.128 --> 07:08.587
Nice to see you.
Hello.

07:08.587 --> 07:10.044
I'm glad you made it.

07:10.044 --> 07:12.378
Look at this
gorgeous bathroom.

07:12.378 --> 07:14.420
Yeah, I wish I could
take credit for it.

07:15.878 --> 07:17.587
- Robert: Take it easy!
- Jackie: Thank you so much.

07:17.587 --> 07:19.044
- Thank you!

07:19.044 --> 07:20.420
Thank you.

07:20.420 --> 07:22.712
- Oh, my God,
we did it.
- Yeah.

07:22.712 --> 07:25.919
35 over asking.
Boom, sold.

07:27.086 --> 07:28.128
Mwah!

07:28.128 --> 07:30.044
- We are so good at this.
- Yeah.

07:30.044 --> 07:31.878
What, you mean
disposing dead animals?

07:31.878 --> 07:33.295
- No, ha.

07:33.295 --> 07:34.836
Flipping houses.

07:34.836 --> 07:36.670
Robbie, we should keep
doing this.

07:36.670 --> 07:40.545
We should team up.
What do you think

07:40.545 --> 07:43.253
Wait. Wait, wait.
We're already teamed up.

07:43.253 --> 07:45.211
We just sold
three in a row

07:45.211 --> 07:47.086
with the help
of a third-party raccoon.

07:47.086 --> 07:49.420
No, we should, I mean,
officially do business.

07:49.420 --> 07:51.753
I buy the houses
and you design and renovate,

07:51.753 --> 07:53.503
and we turn a tidy profit.

07:53.503 --> 07:56.086
Oh, my God. Yes.
What do you say?

07:56.086 --> 07:57.503
Are you kind of,
like, scared,

07:57.503 --> 07:59.712
but also
a teeny bit excited?

07:59.712 --> 08:01.919
- Come on.
Put them up.
- Hmm.

08:01.919 --> 08:03.670
- Put them up.
- I don't know.

08:03.670 --> 08:06.919
- You know you--
- What you're doing
is really annoying, so.

08:06.919 --> 08:11.086
But, uh...
I don't know.

08:11.086 --> 08:12.670
Hate to say it,
but I do like it.

08:16.670 --> 08:19.295
Oh, we have to give Rocky
a proper burial.

08:19.295 --> 08:20.836
I feel very strongly
about that.

08:20.836 --> 08:22.836
- Yeah, you.

08:25.170 --> 08:27.503
We're gonna--
I'm gonna bury
the raccoon?

08:33.794 --> 08:35.295
Meet the ball early,
folks.

08:36.503 --> 08:38.378
Oh.

08:38.378 --> 08:40.462
- Dallas!
- Easy does it.

08:40.462 --> 08:43.295
Pick up the balls
and see you next week.

08:43.295 --> 08:45.295
I meant to do that.

08:45.295 --> 08:47.919
Yeah?
Then great shot.

08:47.919 --> 08:50.044
Well, I wish
I had your serve.

08:50.044 --> 08:51.836
Thanks.
I've been working
like a dog on it.

08:53.336 --> 08:56.253
Um, you know,
just an idea--

08:56.253 --> 08:59.086
you wouldn't want to get
an iced tea after this,
would you?

08:59.086 --> 09:02.170
Why? Did you have
other questions about
your membership?

09:02.170 --> 09:06.336
No, no, just to, um,
cool off, chat,

09:06.336 --> 09:09.044
get to know
each other, and...

09:09.044 --> 09:13.336
Oh. Um, yeah,
I would like that.

09:13.336 --> 09:15.919
Um, I can't today,
though.

09:15.919 --> 09:17.794
- Sure. Um...

09:17.794 --> 09:19.545
I mean, I could pretend

09:19.545 --> 09:21.919
to look at my schedule,
but I'm just gonna--

09:21.919 --> 09:24.753
I'm just gonna go ahead
and say that I'm free.

09:24.753 --> 09:27.003
- Cool.
- Cool.

09:27.003 --> 09:30.670
- All right, well...
- All right. Yeah.

09:34.878 --> 09:38.336
Okay, wine glass rental--
check, right?

09:38.336 --> 09:40.253
What time
are the caterers
coming to set up?

09:40.253 --> 09:42.378
- Tomorrow at 2:00.
- Tomorrow at 2:00...

09:42.378 --> 09:45.503
Oh, I've gotta--
I've gotta decide
how to cover the Pelts.

09:45.503 --> 09:48.712
- I know this is
a touchy subject between us,

09:48.712 --> 09:51.670
but Sylvia and  I would
just feel more comfortable

09:51.670 --> 09:53.211
if it's covered
for the opening.

09:53.211 --> 09:55.128
It's not personal, Diane,
it's just that's--

09:55.128 --> 09:59.044
it's just not part
of Sylvia's work, you know?

09:59.044 --> 10:00.628
Oh, hey, Travis.

10:00.628 --> 10:02.753
- Package for you.
- Ah, thank you.

10:02.753 --> 10:03.878
- There you go.
- Thank you.

10:03.878 --> 10:05.503
- Thanks. See you soon.
- Yeah.

10:07.420 --> 10:09.794
So you want
to cover the Pelts,

10:09.794 --> 10:11.253
the one  thing
that's been

10:11.253 --> 10:13.878
our biggest,
most consistent draw
since we opened?

10:13.878 --> 10:15.462
Sure, I'll just see
if a TaskRabbit

10:15.462 --> 10:18.378
can come whip up
a mile-wide tarp.

10:24.253 --> 10:26.794
- Oh, my God.

10:26.794 --> 10:30.253
It's a piece...
from the Mayberry estate

10:30.253 --> 10:32.836
that I bid on and lost...

10:32.836 --> 10:34.253
to Skip Zakarian.

10:34.253 --> 10:36.128
Skip Zakarian
sent that to you?

10:36.128 --> 10:37.919
- Yes.
- Oh, my God, I love Skip.

10:37.919 --> 10:40.545
Do you know that I went
to the Bahamas with him once
for Thanksgiving?

10:40.545 --> 10:41.794
That's really weird,
isn't it?

10:41.794 --> 10:43.753
Yeah, steel drums
and turkey on the beach.

10:43.753 --> 10:46.170
Not exactly what
the Pilgrims had in mind,
that's for sure.

10:46.170 --> 10:48.170
No, I mean,
should I accept it?

10:48.170 --> 10:50.919
Yes! Yes, Frances.
Are you kidding me?

10:50.919 --> 10:52.587
He's obviously
flirting with you.

10:52.587 --> 10:54.462
- He's so dashing.
- I don't know about that.

10:54.462 --> 10:56.044
You're not going steady
with Andrew, are you?

10:56.044 --> 10:58.545
No, Patty Duke, I don't--
I don't think I am.

10:58.545 --> 11:00.086
Well, what you need
to do, Frances,

11:00.086 --> 11:01.753
is write
your new friend Skip

11:01.753 --> 11:04.336
a little thank-you note
and stay on his good side.

11:04.336 --> 11:06.253
I mean, it can
only help the gallery

11:06.253 --> 11:07.878
for you to be
on his radar.

11:07.878 --> 11:10.545
God, it's beautiful,
isn't it?

11:10.545 --> 11:12.587
It is.

11:12.587 --> 11:15.628
- I mean, that Pelts
was the only reason

11:15.628 --> 11:18.003
we've had any foot traffic
in that gallery since we opened.

11:18.003 --> 11:21.462
- Plain and simple.
- This one got a nice write-up
in "Food & Wine."

11:21.462 --> 11:24.128
Oh, please,
who are they kidding?

11:24.128 --> 11:26.836
Nonalcoholic wines
are bullshit.

11:28.003 --> 11:29.420
Let's get out
of here, honey.

11:29.420 --> 11:32.170
Okay. Good.
I just gotta grab
one more thing.

11:32.170 --> 11:35.420
- I'll meet you up front.
- Okay, don't take too long.

11:37.336 --> 11:38.253
Frances?

11:40.003 --> 11:41.295
Oh.

11:44.044 --> 11:45.878
- Jackie: Oh, my God.

11:45.878 --> 11:47.336
Did you just think
I was Frances?

11:47.336 --> 11:48.961
Yes, I did, but...

11:48.961 --> 11:51.086
these glasses-- I--
these are shitty glasses.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.794
- They don't--
they don't work.
- It's okay.

11:52.794 --> 11:54.794
I actually take it
as a compliment.

11:54.794 --> 11:56.044
- Robert: Hey, Nick.
- Hey.

11:56.044 --> 11:58.961
It's like rush hour
in here.

11:58.961 --> 12:00.503
I don't know
if these are any good.

12:00.503 --> 12:02.003
You have many strengths,

12:02.003 --> 12:04.003
but choosing wine
is not one of them.

12:04.003 --> 12:05.503
I'll be right back.

12:09.836 --> 12:13.211
- Man, do you have a type.

12:13.211 --> 12:17.420
- You like your women
blond and strong.

12:17.420 --> 12:19.378
No shrinking violets
for you.

12:19.378 --> 12:21.044
You talking
Jackie and Frances?

12:21.044 --> 12:22.712
Oh, come on.

12:22.712 --> 12:24.170
They don't have
anything in common.

12:24.170 --> 12:25.670
They're practically
different species.

12:25.670 --> 12:27.128
There's nothing wrong
with having a type.

12:27.128 --> 12:29.211
Diane and Carolyn
are both big talkers.

12:29.211 --> 12:31.044
They could play
each other's body doubles.

12:31.044 --> 12:33.503
Well, Carolyn's hips
are wider

12:33.503 --> 12:35.211
'cause of the kids,
you know.

12:35.211 --> 12:38.086
Nick, I don't see
any resemblance,

12:38.086 --> 12:39.462
physical or otherwise.

12:39.462 --> 12:41.420
Okay. Hey,
maybe it's just me.

12:41.420 --> 12:45.003
- Okay.
- Ready when you are.

12:45.003 --> 12:48.378
You know what?
I think I'm still gonna get
the ones that I liked.

12:48.378 --> 12:51.628
Later, Nick.
Good to see you.

12:51.628 --> 12:53.378
Robert:
Hey, here's the plan.

12:53.378 --> 12:55.003
So, we stop
at the gallery.

12:55.003 --> 12:56.211
One drink.

12:56.211 --> 12:59.044
Avoid talking
to anybody,

12:59.044 --> 13:02.086
and then
we'll go have supper
at Rancho Grande.

13:02.086 --> 13:04.836
Sold. Oh, and just
to get things started

13:04.836 --> 13:06.462
on our company,
I talked to my lawyer.

13:06.462 --> 13:07.794
She's going to work
on an agreement.

13:07.794 --> 13:11.378
Wait, whoa.
You talked to your lawyer?

13:11.378 --> 13:12.878
Why wasn't I on that call?

13:12.878 --> 13:14.836
Because it's all
just boilerplate.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.503
Yeah, "boilerplate"
is code speak

13:16.503 --> 13:17.961
for "you're gonna
get fucked."

13:17.961 --> 13:19.878
I'll get
my own lawyer, thanks.

13:19.878 --> 13:21.919
Why? That's
a complete waste of money.

13:21.919 --> 13:24.170
Because I have
to protect myself.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.753
From what?
This isn't
your divorce, Robbie.

13:26.753 --> 13:28.003
It's a real estate deal.

13:28.003 --> 13:29.836
Yeah, and the deal's
not gonna work

13:29.836 --> 13:33.253
if you and your lawyer
are calling all the shots.

13:33.253 --> 13:35.919
Since when am I calling
all the shots?

13:35.919 --> 13:37.462
Hey, what's going on
with you?

13:37.462 --> 13:38.919
Just trying to be smart.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.128
Just trying to stay
ahead of it, Jackie, okay?

13:41.128 --> 13:44.295
Like I always say,
"You can't be too careful."

13:44.295 --> 13:46.086
You've never said that.

13:49.086 --> 13:53.420
Hey, before I lose you
to the masses...

13:53.420 --> 13:55.128
stay right here.

13:56.961 --> 14:00.919
This was, um--
this was owned
by Astrid Mayberry.

14:00.919 --> 14:03.961
It's a very long story,
but I thought you would
love it.

14:03.961 --> 14:07.086
- Frances, no way.
- Yes way.

14:13.462 --> 14:14.753
It's gorgeous.

14:16.044 --> 14:18.712
I'm an asshole.
I have nothing for you.

14:18.712 --> 14:21.211
Are you kidding me?
Look around.

14:21.211 --> 14:26.295
You-- you have
given me more  than
you will ever know.

14:31.003 --> 14:31.961
Thank you.

14:31.961 --> 14:33.253
Okay, go.
Go, go, go.

14:33.253 --> 14:34.753
- Don't do that. Go.

14:36.253 --> 14:38.712
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.
I'm so nervous,

14:38.712 --> 14:41.628
I don't know if I should,
like, just drink massive
amounts or none at all.

14:41.628 --> 14:44.336
Listen, that prick
from the auction, he's here.

14:44.336 --> 14:45.503
- Yeah.

14:45.503 --> 14:47.044
Oh, my God.

14:47.044 --> 14:48.253
Oh, my God!

14:48.253 --> 14:49.670
This time you gotta
introduce me.

14:49.670 --> 14:50.836
Okay.

14:52.670 --> 14:53.919
Hello, welcome!

14:53.919 --> 14:55.211
Welcome.
- Hi.

14:55.211 --> 14:57.086
I don't know
if your presence--

14:57.086 --> 15:00.378
does that mean it was, like,
the shortest board meeting
in Whitney history?

15:00.378 --> 15:03.336
- It means I played hooky.
- Oh, shh.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.503
- Well, lucky us.
- Andrew Wallace, hi.

15:05.503 --> 15:07.420
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, I'm so sorry. Andrew.

15:07.420 --> 15:11.044
- This is Andrew.
- You must be enjoying
that magnifying glass.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.961
You win some,
you lose some.

15:12.961 --> 15:15.836
- Yeah.
- It's a charming place
you have here.

15:15.836 --> 15:17.336
Thank you, thank you.

15:17.336 --> 15:18.836
And I'll introduce you
to the artist.

15:18.836 --> 15:23.670
I'm sure she would love
to hear any pearls of wisdom

15:23.670 --> 15:25.420
that you would care
to share with her.

15:25.420 --> 15:27.753
- Certainly. I'll--
I'll take a look around.
- Okay.

15:29.170 --> 15:30.753
"Pearls of wisdom"?
Good Lord.

15:30.753 --> 15:32.753
Do you ever just hate
the sound of your own voice?

15:32.753 --> 15:35.003
I can't say
that I do, actually.

15:35.003 --> 15:37.420
Oh. Well, then I guess
it's just me.

15:37.420 --> 15:39.753
Well, it's the belle
of the ball.

15:39.753 --> 15:42.211
- Hey, hey, you two. Hi.
- Hi.

15:42.211 --> 15:44.044
- Good to see you again.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.044
Nice to see you as well.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.753
And might I add,
clothes on,

15:46.753 --> 15:48.919
- zipper up, good look.
- Yes.

15:48.919 --> 15:51.420
This is
my girlfriend, Jackie.

15:51.420 --> 15:53.044
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

15:53.044 --> 15:55.836
Congratulations, Frances.
The work is stunning.

15:55.836 --> 15:57.420
Oh, thank you, thank you.

15:57.420 --> 16:00.128
It's been-- it's been
a stressful couple of weeks.

16:00.128 --> 16:02.587
- I mean, you know.
- And you have done great...

16:02.587 --> 16:04.878
- Thank you.
You've been a...
- ...dealing with it.

16:06.961 --> 16:08.420
We sold another house.

16:08.420 --> 16:10.170
- Frances: Oh, wow!
- It's what we do.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.545
- Congratulations.
- Another one. Thanks.

16:11.545 --> 16:14.086
- Great news.
- Frances: Fantastic.

16:14.086 --> 16:15.336
So, yay all around.

16:15.336 --> 16:17.462
- Yay!

16:17.462 --> 16:19.712
So, I think
I'm ready for that drink.
- I am, too.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.378
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, good talk.

16:21.378 --> 16:23.378
Frances:
Okay, bar's over here.

16:26.587 --> 16:28.545
- Sold!
- Love it.

16:28.545 --> 16:30.211
Boom!

16:30.211 --> 16:31.753
I think you got
a really good piece.

16:31.753 --> 16:34.753
I don't know,
but if you also want
one of these--

16:34.753 --> 16:37.753
Oh, one sec.
- It's quite a turnout.

16:37.753 --> 16:39.919
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, thanks.

16:39.919 --> 16:44.420
And again, thank you
for the magnifying glass.

16:44.420 --> 16:48.128
It was incredibly generous
and very thoughtful.

16:48.128 --> 16:50.128
Thank you
for the thank-you note.

16:50.128 --> 16:54.044
And thank you
for making the trip
all the way up here.

16:54.044 --> 16:55.794
You're welcome,
but if you want
to see me again,

16:55.794 --> 16:57.462
- you'll have to come
into the city.
- Duly noted.

16:57.462 --> 16:59.044
Can I take you out
for dinner sometime?

16:59.044 --> 17:01.086
They have
some wonderful restaurants
in New York now.

17:03.420 --> 17:06.836
Well, uh, thank you.
Thank you.

17:06.836 --> 17:08.420
It's a very lovely
invitation,

17:08.420 --> 17:11.587
but I would-- I would
feel impolite accepting

17:11.587 --> 17:13.712
when I'm-- I'm here
with someone else.

17:13.712 --> 17:16.253
Oh.
That Andrew fellow?

17:16.253 --> 17:19.919
Wow. Too bad.
Good luck.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.462
Ay. Oh, hey.

17:27.462 --> 17:29.503
Uh, I've been
floating around all night.

17:29.503 --> 17:31.503
- I don't want you
to feel neglected.
- Don't worry about it.

17:31.503 --> 17:32.961
- Do your thing.
- Okay.

17:32.961 --> 17:36.794
Just looking for--
oh, there she is.

17:36.794 --> 17:41.086
- Hello. Hi.
- We just sold Lucius.

17:41.086 --> 17:43.170
- Mm-hmm.

17:43.170 --> 17:45.003
- Diane: Ugh.

17:45.003 --> 17:46.336
Get a room.

17:46.336 --> 17:47.961
Why did I even bother
showing up tonight?

17:47.961 --> 17:51.211
- I'm a vapor.
- That's it.

17:51.211 --> 17:52.753
I've had it.

17:55.420 --> 17:57.545
- Woman: Shh, shh, shh.
- Diane: Nick!

18:01.170 --> 18:03.295
Hi, everyone.

18:03.295 --> 18:06.253
Nick Clavowen,
friend of the gallery.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.878
I-- I know
Frances and Sylvia

18:08.878 --> 18:11.044
are grateful to all of you
for coming out tonight.

18:11.044 --> 18:13.878
- I just wanted to mention
one other person--

18:13.878 --> 18:16.128
she doesn't like
to grab the spotlight--

18:16.128 --> 18:20.003
who was indispensable
to tonight's proceedings--

18:20.003 --> 18:22.378
my wife,
Diane Clavowen.

18:22.378 --> 18:24.378
- Crowd: Aw!

18:27.587 --> 18:30.919
- Without Diane...

18:30.919 --> 18:33.628
this masterpiece...

18:35.253 --> 18:38.919
...by Eliot Pelts
would never have been
loaned to the gallery.

18:38.919 --> 18:40.878
Man, it looks like
a toilet monster.

18:40.878 --> 18:45.961
Sadly, after tonight,
the Pelts will be leaving
for another home.

18:45.961 --> 18:48.336
- Ours.

18:48.336 --> 18:51.420
- Purchased
from Brett Morris.

18:51.420 --> 18:53.628
Just a little surprise
from me to you.

18:53.628 --> 18:56.336
- One more way to say,
"I love you, Diane."

18:56.336 --> 18:57.919
- All: Aw.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.128
Nick.

19:02.587 --> 19:06.253
- Halle-fucking-lujah.
- Yeah, this is a win-win.

19:06.253 --> 19:08.919
You should be crying
and thanking him, too.

19:13.295 --> 19:16.044
Ted?
Oh, my God, hi.

19:16.044 --> 19:19.003
Didn't recognize you
without your visor.

19:19.003 --> 19:22.503
- Well, this is
my best friend's gallery.

19:22.503 --> 19:23.753
- Oh.

19:23.753 --> 19:25.753
I was having dinner
two doors down

19:25.753 --> 19:28.878
and saw the free wine
was happening, so...

19:28.878 --> 19:31.086
Hey, they were out
of the shrimp, so...

19:31.086 --> 19:34.545
Melinda, this is Dallas
from tennis that I was
telling you about.

19:34.545 --> 19:36.044
Oh, yes.
Hi.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.587
- I'm good, good.

19:37.587 --> 19:39.712
How do you two
know each other?

19:39.712 --> 19:41.462
- Well...
- Uh, funny story.

19:41.462 --> 19:43.462
Melinda is
my soon-to-be ex-wife.

19:43.462 --> 19:44.628
Ooh, I like that.

19:44.628 --> 19:47.295
- I'm gonna steal that.

19:47.295 --> 19:50.128
- The-- the red tape
from our divorce

19:50.128 --> 19:52.295
is literally lasting longer
than the actual marriage.

19:52.295 --> 19:56.295
Yeah, let's just say
we work better as friends.

19:59.420 --> 20:01.003
Well, I'm gonna grab
another drink.

20:01.003 --> 20:03.086
- I'm good.

20:03.086 --> 20:05.295
- I'm good, thank you.
- Okay.

20:09.628 --> 20:11.794
- That looks like
a good drink.
- Oh, it is.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.545
I would have
ordered you one,

20:13.545 --> 20:17.253
except I thought
you'd wanna represent
your own drink choice.

20:17.253 --> 20:18.670
So that's how
it's gonna be?

20:20.003 --> 20:21.295
It's not just
that I'm old enough

20:21.295 --> 20:22.919
to be your mother...

20:22.919 --> 20:24.503
- No, you're not.
- No, you're right, I'm not.

20:24.503 --> 20:27.253
That was a test,
but, um...

20:27.253 --> 20:30.170
I'm a therapist
who treats a lot of people

20:30.170 --> 20:33.295
who are separated
and really conflicted.

20:33.295 --> 20:35.919
It's because
people like me and Melinda
who aren't conflicted

20:35.919 --> 20:37.628
don't go into therapy.

20:37.628 --> 20:40.587
Look, I know it's weird
that we're still friends,

20:40.587 --> 20:43.003
but it's completely
platonic.

20:43.003 --> 20:47.961
So, what I'm hearing
is you've never been
in therapy.

21:04.961 --> 21:08.211
Yeah.
You're obviously upset.

21:08.211 --> 21:10.128
So, what, you're just--
you're gonna fester

21:10.128 --> 21:11.878
for some period of time

21:11.878 --> 21:14.794
and then a week from now
bite my head off,

21:14.794 --> 21:17.044
and all of it because
I wanna get a lawyer.

21:17.044 --> 21:19.044
Dude, I will bite
your head off right now.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.628
I don't care
that you want a lawyer.

21:20.628 --> 21:22.211
Hire a whole team.
Go nuts.

21:22.211 --> 21:23.836
Well, what is
your fucking problem?

21:23.836 --> 21:25.420
You're the one
with a problem.

21:25.420 --> 21:28.378
You're picking a fight,
and none of this
is about me.

21:28.378 --> 21:29.462
It's about Frances.

21:29.462 --> 21:31.044
So, why don't you call me

21:31.044 --> 21:32.919
when you wanna
fight with me?

21:44.878 --> 21:46.919
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:50.587 --> 21:52.628
Why don't we call it
a night and go celebrate
at your place?

21:52.628 --> 21:54.128
Robert's got the kids
tonight, right?

21:54.128 --> 21:55.628
Uh, no.

21:55.628 --> 21:58.253
I mean, um,
they're spending
the night

21:58.253 --> 22:02.211
at a friend's house,
but... you go.

22:02.211 --> 22:03.670
You go.
Save yourself.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.503
I'll, um-- we'll check in
tomorrow, okay?

22:06.503 --> 22:09.086
Uh, what's going on?
Did I do something wrong?

22:09.086 --> 22:11.794
No, that's not--
not it.

22:13.211 --> 22:17.086
Uh, I'm just not sure
that, um...

22:18.295 --> 22:20.878
that this
is such a good idea.

22:20.878 --> 22:24.628
Oh. Well,
there's a curveball.

22:24.628 --> 22:25.753
Can I ask why?

22:25.753 --> 22:28.545
Well-- and I--
this is silly, I know,

22:28.545 --> 22:30.462
but earlier tonight,
somebody asked me out,

22:30.462 --> 22:32.587
and I'll be honest,
I was tempted.

22:32.587 --> 22:34.128
And I know that
we're not serious

22:34.128 --> 22:39.086
or even exclusive, but I--
I felt guilty, which...

22:40.170 --> 22:42.170
you know,
I know it's crazy.

22:42.170 --> 22:44.587
I get it.
I never should've told you
about my ex's affair.

22:44.587 --> 22:47.336
No. No, I-- I--

22:47.336 --> 22:50.545
really, I appreciated
your honesty.

22:50.545 --> 22:52.211
What I couldn't admit
is that

22:52.211 --> 22:55.794
I was actually
the unfaithful one
in my marriage.

22:57.503 --> 22:59.836
I'm not proud.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.295
Well, you lied to me
about that.

23:01.295 --> 23:05.378
Well, yes, I--
I guess yes.

23:05.378 --> 23:08.420
It-- it was a lie
by omission.

23:08.420 --> 23:10.670
No, it was a lie.
You lied.

23:10.670 --> 23:12.003
And you cheated,
apparently.

23:12.003 --> 23:13.336
I'm-- I'm trying
to be honest.

23:13.336 --> 23:14.878
I didn't even have
to bring this up.

23:14.878 --> 23:17.545
Okay. Mm-hmm.

23:17.545 --> 23:19.420
Listen, maybe this is
for the best.

23:19.420 --> 23:21.462
I mean,
you said it yourself
the night we met.

23:21.462 --> 23:24.420
- It's too soon for me
to be getting involved.
- Yeah, no, I remember.

23:24.420 --> 23:27.170
I think my exact words were
you were a walking disaster,

23:27.170 --> 23:29.420
so maybe I should take
comfort in the fact

23:29.420 --> 23:30.670
that my instincts
were right.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.545
You have every right
to be mad, but you--

23:32.545 --> 23:35.044
- you don't have
to, like, attack--

23:35.044 --> 23:37.670
Thanks, Frances.
Thanks, that's really
generous of you.

23:37.670 --> 23:39.295
Wow.

23:42.670 --> 23:44.961
Wow, uh...

23:44.961 --> 23:47.670
I don't really know
how else to say this,

23:47.670 --> 23:50.211
but you're
the walking disaster,
not me.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.878
You got
the walking part right.

24:44.961 --> 24:47.794
- Frances.
Hey.

24:47.794 --> 24:49.587
Oh, I'm so glad
you thought to do this.

24:49.587 --> 24:52.587
- We have to celebrate.

24:54.670 --> 24:57.878
Can we get, um--
can we get two glasses
of champagne, please?

24:57.878 --> 24:59.587
- Sure.
- Thank you.

24:59.587 --> 25:02.295
I don't know about you,
I'm not typically
a day drinker.

25:02.295 --> 25:03.919
However, I think
we've earned it.

25:03.919 --> 25:07.128
- We have.
- Hi!

25:14.836 --> 25:16.712
Hey.

25:16.712 --> 25:18.919
What are you doing?

25:18.919 --> 25:20.919
I'm burying
this fucking raccoon.

25:20.919 --> 25:23.836
Been stinking up my truck
for the last three days.

25:23.836 --> 25:26.420
I can't do it
at my apartment.

25:26.420 --> 25:28.670
It's a rental.

25:28.670 --> 25:30.670
Probably violate
the health code.

25:35.128 --> 25:37.794
- Get right in there.

25:37.794 --> 25:39.794
That's good.

25:39.794 --> 25:41.462
I gotta say...

25:43.794 --> 25:46.878
no one has ever buried
a dead body for me before.

25:48.295 --> 25:50.503
Yeah, it's a first
for me, too.

25:56.128 --> 25:57.753
- Frances: Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:57.753 --> 25:59.170
Here you go, sir.

25:59.170 --> 26:00.503
Oh, no, I wanted
to treat you.

26:00.503 --> 26:02.753
No, don't be silly.
I'm very happy to.

26:02.753 --> 26:04.878
- Okay, well, thank you.
- You're very welcome.

26:06.170 --> 26:09.211
Actually...
there's one more thing.

26:09.211 --> 26:11.170
Oh, okay.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.670
God, I just got nervous.

26:13.670 --> 26:14.670
No, don't be.

26:14.670 --> 26:16.628
Okay, so, Skip Zakarian

26:16.628 --> 26:18.295
has offered me--
you know Skip Zakarian?

26:18.295 --> 26:20.794
- Of course.
- He wants to rep me.

26:20.794 --> 26:22.753
Like, exclusively.

26:22.753 --> 26:24.503
Starting with
a big-ass SoHo show

26:24.503 --> 26:27.044
at his gallery here
in the city.

26:29.044 --> 26:31.378
I know, it's crazy.

26:31.378 --> 26:33.128
I'm freaking out.

26:34.878 --> 26:35.878
What?
Say something.

26:38.211 --> 26:42.128
And, um--
and you have--

26:42.128 --> 26:44.295
have you--
you've accepted his offer?

26:44.295 --> 26:46.295
Well, yeah, sure.

26:46.295 --> 26:49.503
You understand this means

26:49.503 --> 26:52.044
that we won't be
working together anymore.

26:54.086 --> 26:56.211
- You and I.
- I know, it sucks, but--

26:56.211 --> 26:58.836
- This is a really big deal.

26:58.836 --> 27:00.462
I thought you'd be
happy for me.

27:00.462 --> 27:03.378
No, I am, I am.
I'm just also stunned,
you know?

27:03.378 --> 27:06.336
Because I-- I mean,
I know we didn't have--

27:06.336 --> 27:08.961
um, we didn't have
a formal agreement,

27:08.961 --> 27:13.878
but, um, I did think that
we had an understanding.

27:13.878 --> 27:17.628
You know, I mean,
we've been talking
about your next show.

27:17.628 --> 27:22.587
We have-- we  have been
talking about your future.

27:24.253 --> 27:29.794
And now...
and now you--

27:29.794 --> 27:31.211
I what?

27:31.211 --> 27:34.128
You didn't even
have the decency

27:34.128 --> 27:37.295
to tell me
that you were having
this conversation with Skip

27:37.295 --> 27:42.295
so that I could
at least, like, try
to compete for you.

27:42.295 --> 27:45.462
You weren't even
finishing your paintings
when I met you.

27:45.462 --> 27:47.919
Yeah, but then
I finished them.

27:47.919 --> 27:52.587
Yes, and I scraped
this show together

27:52.587 --> 27:54.919
with spit and blood.

27:54.919 --> 27:56.919
We sold every single piece.

27:56.919 --> 28:00.836
- That's, like, just--
that's unheard of.
- Yeah, you're right.

28:00.836 --> 28:03.420
If it weren't for you,
I'd still be at the bank.

28:03.420 --> 28:04.961
But get real.

28:04.961 --> 28:07.794
If you were in my shoes,
you'd do the same thing.

28:07.794 --> 28:09.378
Really, get real?

28:09.378 --> 28:10.919
You get real.

28:10.919 --> 28:12.420
You waited the whole meal

28:12.420 --> 28:14.378
to give me
this bit of information

28:14.378 --> 28:17.628
because you knew
it was going to be awful.

28:17.628 --> 28:19.628
Okay, but it doesn't
have to be.

28:19.628 --> 28:21.211
It's not personal,
Frances.

28:21.211 --> 28:22.628
It's not personal?

28:22.628 --> 28:26.295
Okay, you know what?
I don't need the guilt trip.

28:26.295 --> 28:28.919
Thanks for everything.
I'm done here.

28:32.836 --> 28:34.670

Robert and Jackie want to take
the kids to Europe this summer.

30:13.462 --> 30:15.545
If I had kids, all I'd want
is a long break from them.

30:16.503 --> 30:19.253
Your real estate partnership
is finalized.

30:19.253 --> 30:20.878
You are now a corporation.

30:21.378 --> 30:22.753
FRANCES DUFRESNE:
I'm like training wheels.

30:22.753 --> 30:24.753
I get them started,
give 'em a little shove,

30:24.753 --> 30:26.587
and then they ride off
without me.

30:26.587 --> 30:27.836
How do you sleep at night?

30:27.836 --> 30:30.086
We could discuss
working together.

30:32.378 --> 30:33.670
DIANE CLAVOWEN: I may have
gotten totally drunk.

30:33.670 --> 30:35.753
I may have side-swiped
some cars.

30:36.253 --> 30:38.086
My only friend that night
was the bottle.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.336
I mean,
that's a little dramatic.

30:39.545 --> 30:42.462
FRANCES: Do you ever wonder,
what if we met each other now?
