00:00.360 --> 00:04.680
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:10.480 --> 00:15.120
You can't turn back time to
stop what happened to Sarah.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.000
And are you willing to burn down
everything to start again? Yes.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.160
And are you willing to burn down
everything to start again? Yes.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.000
A nuclear warhead nicknamed Big Boy
was hijacked.

00:24.000 --> 00:24.040
A nuclear warhead nicknamed Big Boy
was hijacked.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.760
The key is the detonator.
So how do I get it?

00:26.800 --> 00:29.520
I give you a contact who could make
it for you.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.000
Your name's Janet, isn't it?
Archie told me about you.

00:32.000 --> 00:32.440
Your name's Janet, isn't it?
Archie told me about you.

00:32.480 --> 00:34.440
I'm sure she didn't tell you
all of it.

00:34.480 --> 00:37.280
It's a code black, I'm authorising
us to go back.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.680
She lost a child.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.880
It makes sense why you
want to blow up the planet.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.000
I don't want to blow up the planet.
It's just the nuclear detonator

00:48.000 --> 00:48.440
I don't want to blow up the planet.
It's just the nuclear detonator

00:48.480 --> 00:51.120
thing suggests differently.
I won't be the one pressing it.

00:51.160 --> 00:53.680
That'd be you.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.600
La-la. Good night, good night.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.080
Shiv?

01:31.120 --> 01:32.480
Shiv?! Shi-

01:32.520 --> 01:35.760
Oh, my God.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.000
How did you get...?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.840
How did you get...?

01:37.880 --> 01:40.200
You're standing?

01:43.120 --> 01:44.000
Suresh! Suresh! Get in here now!

01:44.000 --> 01:46.200
Suresh! Suresh! Get in here now!

01:46.240 --> 01:48.880
What is it? Yay!

01:48.920 --> 01:52.000
Your baby. Daddy!
He's walking and talking.

01:52.000 --> 01:52.760
Your baby. Daddy!
He's walking and talking.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.960
What? Man!

01:56.000 --> 01:58.160
He's walking and talking?

01:58.200 --> 02:00.000
I have three kids, Doctor Anand.
I know when something's off.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.920
I have three kids, Doctor Anand.
I know when something's off.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.800
Yesterday he had never walked
a step or said a word.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.000
This morning he climbed out
of his cot and started talking

02:08.000 --> 02:10.160
This morning he climbed out
of his cot and started talking

02:10.200 --> 02:15.480
in full sentences. It's like he's
developed six months overnight.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.880
What's the matter? Another dream?

02:21.840 --> 02:24.000
The man on the TV
said there was a war.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.640
The man on the TV
said there was a war.

02:25.680 --> 02:29.960
There was a bomb where Granny
and Grandpa live.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
It's OK, darling.
It's not real.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.160
It's OK, darling.
It's not real.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.600
But it is real.

03:28.320 --> 03:32.600
Hey, Uncle, what happened to the
wall? Well, I woke up this morning

03:32.640 --> 03:36.000
and decided to write racist graffiti
all over the front of my shop.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.520
and decided to write racist graffiti
all over the front of my shop.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.080
What do you think happened?!
Skinheads again.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.600
Did they break any
windows this time?

03:41.640 --> 03:43.880
They did not. Perhaps they thought
we're not worth the price

03:43.920 --> 03:44.000
of a brick. Still, exciting to find
out over and over again

03:44.000 --> 03:46.680
of a brick. Still, exciting to find
out over and over again

03:46.720 --> 03:49.160
we're from Pakistan.
Always a surprise.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.800
Can you put this on my tab? No!

03:53.240 --> 03:55.640
I'm sorry, Shiv.
No more freebies.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.000
Hey, listen er, your dad's money
problems. They're gonna be OK.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.280
Hey, listen er, your dad's money
problems. They're gonna be OK.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.720
That's very reassuring, thank you.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.840
I mean it. I've got a plan.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.000
Keep the change.
Thanks, Bono.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.720
Keep the change.
Thanks, Bono.

04:43.760 --> 04:47.960
Black Marble. Tea for Charlie.
Lost Girl.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.320
Different Cities. Homeward Bound.
Make Do and Mend.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.000
Black Marble. Tea for Charlie.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.240
Black Marble. Tea for Charlie.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.960
Lost Girl. Different Class. Homeward
Bound. Make Do and Mend.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Make Do and Mend. Black Marble.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.200
Make Do and Mend. Black Marble.

05:04.240 --> 05:08.360
Tea for Charlie. Lost Girl.
Different Class.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.320
Homeward Bound.
Make Do and Mend.

05:13.680 --> 05:18.120
We're now receiving reports that
a missile strike is imminent.

05:47.480 --> 05:51.360
I want to put a bet on Black Marble
at the 2.30 at Epsom Downs.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.000
You got ID?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.280
You got ID?

05:56.480 --> 05:59.840
Alright. How much?
Five pounds, please.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.840
And he's done it,
Black Marble wins.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.320
Shit.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.840
Every little helps, I guess.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.000
I can't let you through, son.
That's my uncle's shop! Sorry.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I can't let you through, son.
That's my uncle's shop! Sorry.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.680
Dad? Shiv!

07:51.720 --> 07:52.000
They're gone, Shiv.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.440
They're gone, Shiv.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.520
They're gone.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.600
What happened?

07:58.640 --> 08:00.000
Bloody fascists burned
the place down.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.320
Bloody fascists burned
the place down.

08:04.360 --> 08:07.360
They never stood a chance.

08:34.200 --> 08:38.520
Cousin! What are you doing? Are you
having a breakdown or something?

08:38.560 --> 08:40.000
Er, no, no. I just er...

08:40.000 --> 08:40.720
Er, no, no. I just er...

08:40.760 --> 08:44.080
here for some milk, actually.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
You're weird, man.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.120
You're weird, man.

09:47.960 --> 09:51.720
What are you doing here? You know,
the guy with the petrol can

09:51.760 --> 09:52.000
doesn't get to ask the questions.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.640
doesn't get to ask the questions.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.480
We're in debt, Shiv. My mum and dad
think they can keep this place

09:59.520 --> 10:00.000
afloat but they can't. If it ain't
the bailiffs coming round,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.360
afloat but they can't. If it ain't
the bailiffs coming round,

10:02.400 --> 10:05.240
it's the fucking National Front.
So you're gonna torch it? Shh!

10:06.720 --> 10:08.000
I'll make it look like the NF did
it. We can get the insurance money-

10:08.000 --> 10:09.960
I'll make it look like the NF did
it. We can get the insurance money-

10:10.000 --> 10:13.520
I could have helped you. Yeah,
by doing what? Robbing a bank?

10:13.560 --> 10:15.920
Forget it, man. Go home.
Your family are upstairs.

10:15.960 --> 10:16.000
I'll take them out the back before
the fire takes hold. No. You won't.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.560
I'll take them out the back before
the fire takes hold. No. You won't.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.840
By the time it spreads-
"By the time it spreads?!"

10:20.880 --> 10:23.120
You're setting a bonfire next
to spirits and magazines,

10:23.160 --> 10:24.000
you stupid dickhead. It's gonna
spread in ten fucking seconds.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.880
you stupid dickhead. It's gonna
spread in ten fucking seconds.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.880
Trust me... I know.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.520
What are you doing here?

10:39.600 --> 10:40.000
I came to save you.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.960
I came to save you.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.560
Oh, what have you done?!
This ain't on me.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.000
Oh, come on.
This ain't on me, man.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.960
Oh, come on.
This ain't on me, man.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.520
Get back, please sir.
Step back, please, sir.

10:52.640 --> 10:55.800
He hasn't done anything.

11:07.680 --> 11:10.440
You did a good thing tonight, Shiv.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.920
Who are you? I'm your new boss.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.360
I've been watching you for a while.
I wasn't sure you were ready.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.000
But I am now.
What are you talking about?

11:20.000 --> 11:20.440
But I am now.
What are you talking about?

11:20.480 --> 11:22.160
Black Marble?

11:22.200 --> 11:26.000
Tea For Charlie. Lost Girl.
Different Class.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.000
Homeward Bound. Make Do and Mend.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Homeward Bound. Make Do and Mend.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.640
Why don't you come and sit down?

11:33.680 --> 11:35.960
You're about to learn some stuff.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.000
You want to know what
all this means. Yeah.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.200
You want to know what
all this means. Yeah.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.880
You should ask The Lost Glory.
Oh, no, you can't.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.360
They gave you the slip again.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.000
Where's Big Boy. Where's the bomb?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.280
Where's Big Boy. Where's the bomb?

12:02.320 --> 12:05.160
I don't know, Shiv. You picked me up
before they delivered it.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.000
They're not Royal Mail. You can't
track the delivery from the depot.

12:08.000 --> 12:08.800
They're not Royal Mail. You can't
track the delivery from the depot.

12:09.840 --> 12:14.400
You not gonna smack me around a bit,
see if I'm telling the truth?

12:14.440 --> 12:16.000
You're gonna stay in that cell
until you tell us.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.760
You're gonna stay in that cell
until you tell us.

12:19.520 --> 12:22.840
We've run a
programme over all these maps,

12:22.880 --> 12:24.000
they don't correlate to any known
area in our system.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.240
they don't correlate to any known
area in our system.

12:25.280 --> 12:28.240
We've tried layering them, reversing
them, pulling out landmarks.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.400
I'm not sure that
these are real places.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.000
So the guys are just like doodling
pretend maps? Clearly not.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.080
So the guys are just like doodling
pretend maps? Clearly not.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.360
There's a code in there.
We just have to crack it.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.000
But all the intel we have suggests
that The Lost Glory

12:40.000 --> 12:40.120
But all the intel we have suggests
that The Lost Glory

12:40.160 --> 12:43.840
were communicating with a splinter
cell based out of Romania

12:43.880 --> 12:47.000
but that's about it.

12:47.040 --> 12:48.000
Rebrov couldn't tell us anymore?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.200
Rebrov couldn't tell us anymore?

12:50.240 --> 12:54.120
No, I spoke to him.
He's not giving us anything.

13:16.840 --> 13:20.000
What did you mean when you
said you'd talked to Rebrov?

13:20.000 --> 13:20.240
What did you mean when you
said you'd talked to Rebrov?

13:21.560 --> 13:25.360
An interrogation.
What does interrogation mean?

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Do you need a dictionary?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.040
Do you need a dictionary?

13:29.080 --> 13:32.960
Do you need a copy of
the Geneva Convention?

13:36.720 --> 13:39.480
I'm not torturing him, George. The
last time I saw him, he looked like

13:39.520 --> 13:44.000
he'd run into the back of a truck.
What were you doing seeing him?

13:44.040 --> 13:47.560
I wanted to talk to him. Sorry,
should that be "interrogate"?

13:47.600 --> 13:50.480
What expression do we use when
we've spoken to someone

13:50.520 --> 13:52.000
and not beaten them senseless?
What did you talk about? Not much.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.680
and not beaten them senseless?
What did you talk about? Not much.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.840
He wasn't in the mood for a chat.
Maybe cos one of my colleagues

13:56.880 --> 14:00.000
had already made him swallow his own
teeth. I don't know.

14:00.000 --> 14:00.560
had already made him swallow his own
teeth. I don't know.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.800
I got some shitty intel once.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.000
And things went bad and we're
still paying for it.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.680
And things went bad and we're
still paying for it.

14:17.720 --> 14:21.720
All cos the guy whose job it was to
get the truth didn't do his job.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.480
If you're a road sweeper,
you can make a mistake.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.240
If you're a traffic cop,
you can make a mistake.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.000
If you work here, you cannot
make a fucking mistake.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.360
If you work here, you cannot
make a fucking mistake.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.560
That's the beginning, middle
and end of it.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.000
You shot the wrong man.

14:40.000 --> 14:40.600
You shot the wrong man.

14:40.640 --> 14:44.280
He used decoys. Intel fuck-up.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.000
She had more time than my son.
Take me to it.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
She had more time than my son.
Take me to it.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.640
Put it down.

15:11.840 --> 15:12.000
Janet, I'm sorry.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.760
Janet, I'm sorry.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.440
You need to run.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.000
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me, Shiv?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.960
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me, Shiv?

16:19.000 --> 16:22.800
Why don't you come back?
We can talk about this.

16:22.840 --> 16:24.000
I don't think so.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.360
I don't think so.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.920
I'm out.

16:27.960 --> 16:30.000
What about Janet?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.000
Are you gonna leave her?
And the baby?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.120
Are you gonna leave her?
And the baby?

16:34.160 --> 16:36.560
You leave them out of it!

16:36.600 --> 16:38.400
I can't do that.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.320
Have you ever considered we might
not be the good guys?

16:44.440 --> 16:46.360
I've thought about it.

16:46.400 --> 16:48.000
And? And I think we're
the fucking good guys.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.400
And? And I think we're
the fucking good guys.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.680
What does that make me, then?
Well, I think that entirely

16:54.720 --> 16:56.000
depends on the next few minutes.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.440
depends on the next few minutes.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.000
This is all your fault, you know?

17:04.000 --> 17:04.600
This is all your fault, you know?

17:10.480 --> 17:12.000
This is all on you.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.680
This is all on you.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.840
Dennis!

17:17.840 --> 17:20.000
Dennis! All you had to do was
shoot the right man.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Dennis! All you had to do was
shoot the right man.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.080
Are you OK? Fuck off.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.920
I'm taking you to the hospital.

17:54.320 --> 17:58.360
Dennis. This is Shiv, Janet.
I've got Dennis with me.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.000
He's been wounded in the
leg but he's gonna be OK.

18:00.000 --> 18:00.600
He's been wounded in the
leg but he's gonna be OK.

18:00.640 --> 18:04.200
I need you to come into the office.
I want to speak to my husband.

18:04.240 --> 18:08.000
Can't let you do that. You owe me,
Shiv. You owe us both.

18:08.000 --> 18:08.200
Can't let you do that. You owe me,
Shiv. You owe us both.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.800
I'm gonna drop him off
at the hospital,

18:10.840 --> 18:13.800
then I'm coming to pick you up.
You have an hour.

18:34.840 --> 18:38.920
No one goes in or out. I've got
people coming to pick him up.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.960
Shiv? Yeah? We've lost him.

19:48.760 --> 19:52.000
Rebrov. He broke the neck
of a guard and fled.

19:52.000 --> 19:52.080
Rebrov. He broke the neck
of a guard and fled.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.520
And Janet?

19:54.560 --> 19:58.280
Gone. Jesus Christ, Shiv.
How did this happen?

20:13.720 --> 20:16.000
Clocking off time.
Let's grab a pint.

20:16.000 --> 20:16.280
Clocking off time.
Let's grab a pint.

20:16.320 --> 20:19.600
Erm, I'm not really in the mood.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.240
Well, I'm not really in
the mood to drink alone

20:22.280 --> 20:24.000
and I outrank you so get your coat.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.920
and I outrank you so get your coat.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.800
Does Lazarus torture people?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.280
It's happened.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.760
"Happened" is past tense.
It's happening.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.480
Now. Shiv's kicking ten
bells out of Rebrov.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.000
No, he isn't. Why's he
got a black eye, then?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.400
No, he isn't. Why's he
got a black eye, then?

21:06.440 --> 21:08.560
Cos I hit him.

21:10.120 --> 21:12.000
Why? Cos there's a nuclear warhead
on the loose

21:12.000 --> 21:13.440
Why? Cos there's a nuclear warhead
on the loose

21:13.480 --> 21:16.440
and I tried everything else.
Do you feel good about that?

21:16.480 --> 21:20.000
Right now, there's hundreds of
thousands of lives in the balance.

21:20.000 --> 21:20.400
Right now, there's hundreds of
thousands of lives in the balance.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.760
Do I support torture? No.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.240
Do I cry myself to sleep cos the
guy that can stop all of this

21:25.280 --> 21:27.920
got slapped around a little bit? No.
Not if we win.

21:27.960 --> 21:28.000
He used to be your friend.
"Used to be." Past tense.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.680
He used to be your friend.
"Used to be." Past tense.

21:30.720 --> 21:34.040
What happened?
Things went bad.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.000
Mistakes were made.
Here we all are.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.880
Mistakes were made.
Here we all are.

21:37.960 --> 21:41.920
Rebrov said Shiv used to waterboard-
He's lying. How do you know?

21:41.960 --> 21:44.000
Cos I know. Maybe you'd know for
sure if you hadn't taken the
security cameras out of the cell.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.440
Cos I know. Maybe you'd know for
sure if you hadn't taken the
security cameras out of the cell.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.240
Right, say you think a
bomb's about to go off

21:49.280 --> 21:51.440
and you couldn't reset,
would you torture him then?

21:51.480 --> 21:52.000
Would you pull his teeth?
Would you blind him?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.560
Would you pull his teeth?
Would you blind him?

21:53.600 --> 21:56.080
Cut his fucking balls off? I'm
trying to establish where the line

21:56.120 --> 21:59.600
of moral certainty starts to blur
for you. I'll cut your fucking balls
off in a minute.

21:59.640 --> 22:00.000
You didn't join the boy scouts,
George. We deal with big stuff here.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.680
You didn't join the boy scouts,
George. We deal with big stuff here.

22:02.720 --> 22:05.040
People get hurt. Sometimes badly.
Sometimes by you.

22:05.080 --> 22:08.000
Well perhaps you should have told me
that when you recruited me.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.760
Well perhaps you should have told me
that when you recruited me.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.600
That nagging feeling of doubt you
have in the back of your head?

22:11.640 --> 22:15.440
Learn to ignore it,
but hope it never goes away.

22:15.480 --> 22:16.000
Thanks for the pint.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.560
Thanks for the pint.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.400
We need to talk
about the funeral.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.000
George?

22:40.000 --> 22:40.040
George?

22:40.080 --> 22:45.600
Yeah. Sorry. Yeah,
I need to organise it.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.800
We can do all of that for you,
you don't need to worry.

22:47.840 --> 22:48.000
No, she's my wife,
I should be the one...

22:48.000 --> 22:51.200
No, she's my wife,
I should be the one...

22:51.240 --> 22:55.480
George? Nothing. Sorry.

22:55.520 --> 22:56.000
She wasn't my wife. You know what I
mean. It's OK. It's awful,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.280
She wasn't my wife. You know what I
mean. It's OK. It's awful,

22:59.320 --> 23:03.280
all of it. How are you coping?
Are you talking to someone?

23:03.320 --> 23:04.000
There's no shame in it.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.320
There's no shame in it.

23:06.320 --> 23:08.640
Maybe you and me should
go for a pint sometime.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.000
George? No, I have to go, Ian.
Just leave it with me. I'll fix it.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.480
George? No, I have to go, Ian.
Just leave it with me. I'll fix it.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.960
Highest point, highest point...

23:28.080 --> 23:32.960
From 227m so you get
the highest point for each map.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.000
255, 64, 32m.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.640
255, 64, 32m.

23:44.680 --> 23:47.760
So five points, five numbers.

23:47.800 --> 23:51.680
A sequence of five numbers.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.880
It's an IP address.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.000
It's an IP address
from the map data.

24:08.000 --> 24:08.760
It's an IP address
from the map data.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.440
Romania.

24:28.640 --> 24:30.240
Got ya.

26:21.560 --> 26:24.000
Archie? It's erm, it's George.

26:24.000 --> 26:24.160
Archie? It's erm, it's George.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.320
I'm just calling cos-
Archie's away from her desk.

26:26.360 --> 26:29.280
This is Shiv. Oh.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.000
Cool, OK. Er, well, I'm just ringing
in because I'm not feeling well.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.240
Cool, OK. Er, well, I'm just ringing
in because I'm not feeling well.

26:35.280 --> 26:38.680
I've got a bug or something.
Chucking up all night.

26:38.720 --> 26:40.000
Think I need to
take a day or two off.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.840
Think I need to
take a day or two off.

26:41.880 --> 26:45.960
OK. I ate something, maybe?

26:47.480 --> 26:48.000
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.600
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.480
Thank you.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.000
Hey, Ryan, I need to get a look at
an individual's bank accounts

27:20.000 --> 27:21.160
Hey, Ryan, I need to get a look at
an individual's bank accounts

27:21.200 --> 27:24.320
for the last month. Yeah,
have you got the paperwork?

27:24.360 --> 27:26.480
It's time sensitive.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.000
I mean, we can get a retroactive
warrant after the fact

27:28.000 --> 27:29.200
I mean, we can get a retroactive
warrant after the fact

27:29.240 --> 27:32.080
but it's risky.
I'll front it, don't worry.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.720
OK. Erm, yeah.
Whose account do you need?

27:35.760 --> 27:36.000
Agent Addo. George? This is
just between me and you, OK?

27:36.000 --> 27:39.760
Agent Addo. George? This is
just between me and you, OK?

27:42.720 --> 27:44.000
Yeah, OK.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.200
Yeah, OK.

27:55.160 --> 27:59.720
OK? Yeah. Forget it. Thanks.

28:05.160 --> 28:08.000
Erm, I need you to find the account
for George's partner.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.680
Erm, I need you to find the account
for George's partner.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.920
I don't know her surname
but her first name's Sarah,

28:12.960 --> 28:16.000
she was a teacher at a primary
school and she's dead.

28:16.000 --> 28:16.800
she was a teacher at a primary
school and she's dead.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.840
But her account might still be open.
Are you sure about this? Yes.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.000
OK.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.400
OK.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.000
Hey, what you looking at? Some
bullshit. Nothing interesting.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.800
Hey, what you looking at? Some
bullshit. Nothing interesting.

28:42.840 --> 28:45.880
Where's George today? Er, he called.
He can't come in,

28:45.920 --> 28:47.840
not feeling himself.

28:51.320 --> 28:55.880
I'm heading out.
Call me if anything comes up.

29:01.920 --> 29:04.000
I want live updates
on those accounts.

29:04.000 --> 29:04.120
I want live updates
on those accounts.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.920
I don't care if he's buying bog roll
and milk, I want to know about it.

29:07.960 --> 29:10.600
Where are you going? Bucharest.

30:16.320 --> 30:19.240
I need you to look up what
variables of destinations

30:19.280 --> 30:23.960
spending 57 Romanian Leu at
Bucharest train station will get
you. Sure thing. Be quick.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.840
My plane's boarding.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.000
There's five destinations you can
get to by spending that amount.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.040
There's five destinations you can
get to by spending that amount.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.680
Three direct trains and two with
changes. They're kind of spread out
though.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.000
Send me through the options and any
updates on the card, let me know.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.040
Send me through the options and any
updates on the card, let me know.

30:48.920 --> 30:51.120
Have a good flight. Thanks.

30:55.480 --> 30:56.000
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
Bucharest Henri Coanda

30:56.000 --> 30:59.320
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
Bucharest Henri Coanda

30:59.360 --> 31:01.600
International Airport.

31:09.320 --> 31:11.200
Thanks.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.600
You said there were five possible
destinations with the ticket price
he paid.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.000
How many of those destinations
depart from platform one?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.960
How many of those destinations
depart from platform one?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.200
Er, er, one. Brasov.

32:12.240 --> 32:15.880
I don't see it on the board.
No, there's work on the line.

32:15.920 --> 32:16.000
They're having to change at Mizil.
Next one to Mizil isn't for 2 hours.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.960
They're having to change at Mizil.
Next one to Mizil isn't for 2 hours.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.320
A taxi can get
you there in one.

32:59.320 --> 33:02.600
Yeah. He just made a
purchase for £4.99

33:02.640 --> 33:04.000
for an in-game upgrade of
ten golden gemstones. OK.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.440
for an in-game upgrade of
ten golden gemstones. OK.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.240
Thanks.

34:00.760 --> 34:04.080
Need receipt?

38:34.960 --> 38:38.080
Hey! Hey!

39:43.720 --> 39:44.000
Hi, Mo. What's up?

39:44.000 --> 39:47.320
Hi, Mo. What's up?

39:49.080 --> 39:51.720
You're a fucking idiot.
What the hell are you doing?

39:51.760 --> 39:52.000
Did you see me fall out of that
window? That was intense.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.400
Did you see me fall out of that
window? That was intense.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.720
You worked out where Big Boy is.
Yeah.

39:57.760 --> 40:00.000
Well, now you're gonna tell me
where it is. No. George,

40:00.000 --> 40:00.600
Well, now you're gonna tell me
where it is. No. George,

40:00.640 --> 40:03.640
you don't want to go
down this path.

40:03.680 --> 40:07.600
Look at me, man.
I, I think I'm down the path.

40:07.640 --> 40:08.000
No, you're not. You're grieving.
You're not just grieving,

40:08.000 --> 40:11.280
No, you're not. You're grieving.
You're not just grieving,

40:11.320 --> 40:14.440
going through something almost no
one in history has gone through.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.000
You've lost someone and you have the
chance to bring them back.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.400
You've lost someone and you have the
chance to bring them back.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.760
That's some pretty fucking
heavy shit, George.

40:20.800 --> 40:24.000
Yeah, it's pretty fucking heavy.
But you can't do it.

40:24.000 --> 40:24.280
Yeah, it's pretty fucking heavy.
But you can't do it.

40:25.800 --> 40:28.560
You can't put hundreds of thousands
of lives at risk.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.000
You can't turn back billions of
lives just because you can.

40:31.040 --> 40:32.000
You know that.
Deep down you know that.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.720
You know that.
Deep down you know that.

40:34.760 --> 40:38.120
It's actually not that deep down.

40:44.600 --> 40:48.000
So come back with me.
I promise you, we can sort this.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.280
So come back with me.
I promise you, we can sort this.

40:49.320 --> 40:52.520
You're not like Rebrov.

40:52.560 --> 40:55.160
You're not gonna do
the things he's done.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.760
Ah!

41:25.040 --> 41:27.920
Does anyone else know about this?

41:31.240 --> 41:34.440
I'm gonna bring her back, Shiv.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.000
I'm gonna bring you back, too.
The first thing I'm gonna do

41:36.000 --> 41:38.440
I'm gonna bring you back, too.
The first thing I'm gonna do

41:38.480 --> 41:41.200
is come for you.

41:41.240 --> 41:42.920
I know.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.000
Er, I need to see the prisoner.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.840
Er, I need to see the prisoner.

43:24.920 --> 43:27.360
I have a message for you.

43:31.560 --> 43:34.320
Big plans are afoot.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.000
Step away! Get back!

44:16.000 --> 44:17.600
Step away! Get back!
