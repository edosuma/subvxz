01:29.997 --> 01:31.766
<i>Today I'm gonna pray.</i>

01:35.134 --> 01:38.038
<i>I'm gonna pray that God,
as usual, ain't looking.</i>

01:41.208 --> 01:44.812
<i>I'm gonna pray that he slept in
and didn't make it to the office.</i>

01:47.380 --> 01:49.884
<i>I'm gonna pray
that today will be different...</i>

01:52.753 --> 01:54.288
<i>...will be new.</i>

01:56.824 --> 01:59.693
<i>Today, I'm gonna pray
for peace of mind...</i>

02:00.794 --> 02:04.932
<i>in the name of the abused
and neglected...</i>

02:07.033 --> 02:09.971
<i>and the motherfucker
that owe us all some money.</i>

02:11.771 --> 02:13.173
<i>Amen.</i>

02:34.161 --> 02:37.298
- Mr. Charlie.
- Hey, Angela.

02:37.430 --> 02:39.866
You and me
need to have a little talk.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.735
What happened?

02:42.870 --> 02:45.539
I don't want the motherfucking
police coming over here, okay?

02:45.672 --> 02:49.643
They acting wild, they acting crazy.
They drawing attention to everybody.

02:49.775 --> 02:53.779
Oh, goddamn it. I'm sorry. I...
I'll have a talk with them.

02:53.913 --> 02:58.050
No, you said that shit two months ago
and ain't a motherfucking thing changed.

02:58.185 --> 03:00.354
It's like you let him do
whatever the fuck he wants.

03:00.487 --> 03:02.621
- That's not really fair, Angela.
- It is fair, Angela.

03:02.756 --> 03:05.893
No, that's not really true.
Boys will be boys. You know that.

03:06.025 --> 03:07.761
But I'm gonna have a chat
with him right now.

03:07.894 --> 03:09.762
You handle your shit, okay?

03:09.896 --> 03:11.298
I'm tired of this shit.

03:11.430 --> 03:13.799
Bringing everybody's
motherfucking property down!

03:13.934 --> 03:16.436
- Shh!
- You shh. Shushing me.

03:18.438 --> 03:21.508
Hey. It's me.

03:23.477 --> 03:25.012
Brought you some lunch.

03:35.722 --> 03:39.959
Listen... Angela is screaming
at me out in the middle of the street

03:40.093 --> 03:41.829
about you and your buddies.

03:41.961 --> 03:44.864
You guys gotta bring
the noise levels down, okay?

03:44.997 --> 03:47.700
I'm tired of listening
to her crazy ass.

03:47.835 --> 03:49.436
I gotta go run some errands,

03:49.569 --> 03:52.438
so I'm gonna leave your allowance
on the dining room table.

03:52.573 --> 03:57.144
Are you gonna help me out with this?
Keep it down? Huh?

03:58.612 --> 04:01.215
Promise? All right.

04:02.216 --> 04:05.853
Little. Little circles.
All right. Bye.

04:18.866 --> 04:20.233
"Earth."

04:22.402 --> 04:23.503
"Venus."

04:24.703 --> 04:26.172
Calvin!

04:26.306 --> 04:29.075
Calvin, you hear me talking to you?
Don't play deaf.

04:29.208 --> 04:30.910
- What?
- Did you take your meds?

04:31.044 --> 04:33.646
- No.
- Take your meds, Calvin.

04:33.780 --> 04:35.882
I don't even like pills.

04:36.015 --> 04:37.616
Get your ass up
and get to school.

04:37.751 --> 04:38.952
I don't got school today.

04:39.085 --> 04:40.753
Boy, would you quit lying?

04:40.886 --> 04:44.225
The school called and said you
only been showing up for lunch.

04:44.357 --> 04:46.393
Meals are important.
Gotta get those meal tickets.

04:46.525 --> 04:49.729
Get your ass up and let's go!
I'm not playing!

04:49.862 --> 04:51.364
"I'm not playing, Calvin."

04:52.198 --> 04:54.001
Don't mock me, Calvin.

04:56.869 --> 05:01.040
I was being nice.

05:08.414 --> 05:09.917
- You didn't think that was funny?
- No.

05:10.049 --> 05:12.384
No.

05:12.518 --> 05:16.624
Can't get lucky.
What class you got today?

05:16.756 --> 05:19.126
- Math.
- Math? You like math, right?

05:19.258 --> 05:22.328
- Yeah.
- All right. I'm gonna help you practice. Um...

05:22.462 --> 05:25.498
All right.
What's, uh, five times five?

05:25.631 --> 05:27.268
Twenty-five.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.335
Eat up, baby.

05:28.469 --> 05:30.003
Thanks, Mom.

05:30.737 --> 05:32.606
I need you
to watch him on Friday.

05:32.739 --> 05:33.840
Gloria got surgery.

05:33.972 --> 05:35.542
Back to the club then.

05:36.742 --> 05:38.544
Yeah, back to the club.

05:39.813 --> 05:42.682
Shit's been a little tight around
here, in case you haven't noticed.

05:42.816 --> 05:45.085
Tight?

05:45.219 --> 05:48.088
- That's funny of you to say.
- What's so funny?

05:53.160 --> 05:54.828
Eat your breakfast.

05:56.429 --> 05:59.399
Nice one... Mom.

06:03.703 --> 06:04.938
All right.

06:06.039 --> 06:07.974
What's, uh, ten times ten?

06:08.107 --> 06:10.609
- A hundred.
- Pshh! My God.

06:13.313 --> 06:15.449
Stop this shit
and go to school. Now.

06:15.582 --> 06:17.484
All right. Geez.

06:19.318 --> 06:21.121
- Nicky, I'm not kidding.
- All right.

06:21.254 --> 06:23.189
What's that?

06:23.323 --> 06:26.092
<i>My mom
taught me this saying...</i>

06:26.225 --> 06:28.427
<i>"Sorrow is like treasure.</i>

06:28.561 --> 06:30.496
<i>You only show it
to your friends."</i>

06:30.629 --> 06:33.199
Nigga, I'm going to school,
get my "edu-ma-cation."

06:33.333 --> 06:35.803
- You ain't been all year.
- School is fun, Calvin.

06:35.936 --> 06:38.305
Exactly.
School is fun!

06:38.438 --> 06:41.474
Fill that brain with knowledge.
You feel me? Ah!

06:41.607 --> 06:44.443
<i>Then life taught me some
treasures you got to keep buried.</i>

06:44.578 --> 06:47.147
Everybody, I'm going back to school!
I'm going back!

06:47.280 --> 06:49.416
No, you ain't.
Nigga, stop!

06:49.549 --> 06:51.986
Come with me.
I'm going back.

07:03.929 --> 07:06.866
What's up, Greg? Long time no see, nigga.
What's that been like?

07:07.001 --> 07:10.337
- You tripping.
- Catch you in the hood, homey.

07:10.470 --> 07:11.938
Peace out.

07:23.784 --> 07:27.021
Bye-bye.

07:28.153 --> 07:30.155
Oh, here you go.

07:30.289 --> 07:32.758
Oh, thank you.

07:32.891 --> 07:34.827
- Hi.
- Hi. How you doing?

07:34.960 --> 07:37.898
Great. Let's see.

07:38.030 --> 07:40.633
Okay.
Do you have a form of ID?

07:41.400 --> 07:43.302
That's all the ID I got.

07:43.436 --> 07:47.073
We need two forms of ID.
That's our policy here.

07:47.207 --> 07:50.511
Uh... I just...
I just got out of prison.

07:51.677 --> 07:54.347
Um... I don't
make the rules, you know?

07:54.480 --> 07:57.450
It's cool. All right.
Uh, let me give you my PO's number.

07:57.583 --> 08:00.419
- Uh, but we still need two forms of ID.
- He'll straighten this shit out.

08:00.554 --> 08:02.655
Do you have, like,
a driver's license?

08:02.789 --> 08:04.858
Ain't got no goddamn
driver's license, woman.

08:04.991 --> 08:06.426
I just got out
of fucking prison.

08:06.559 --> 08:09.963
It's cool, dawg. It's cool.

08:14.133 --> 08:16.069
Look, just call this number.

08:19.907 --> 08:21.608
I can't.

08:23.242 --> 08:25.345
I'm sorry.

08:27.246 --> 08:28.681
No, you ain't.

08:32.116 --> 08:33.753
Next.

08:33.886 --> 08:39.191
I'm serious here, Calvin.
You are a very, very smart young man.

08:39.325 --> 08:42.729
I mean, perhaps even... even gifted.

08:42.863 --> 08:45.799
Last year you scored in the
top ten percentile on the PSAT,

08:45.932 --> 08:48.701
- and yet this year on the SAT...
- Nah.

08:48.835 --> 08:52.305
If you just applied yourself,
there's no telling how far you could go.

08:52.439 --> 08:53.807
Venus.

08:53.940 --> 08:55.275
Excuse me?

08:55.408 --> 08:57.576
I will be using my genius...

08:57.710 --> 09:00.079
...to go to Venus.

09:00.213 --> 09:01.381
I'm trying to be serious...

09:01.513 --> 09:03.584
Nigga, I'm being serious, too.

09:10.523 --> 09:14.061
I'm gonna make arrangements
for you to retake the exam.

09:14.194 --> 09:16.996
But you have to
apply yourself,

09:17.129 --> 09:21.467
and for God's sake,
do not answer every question with a "D."

09:21.600 --> 09:24.303
I mean, why would
you do that anyway?

09:25.939 --> 09:28.042
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

09:35.248 --> 09:37.551
"D" is for "damned."

09:43.623 --> 09:47.494
All right. Mess this nigga up!
Motherfucker, what?

09:47.627 --> 09:50.531
What, nigga?

09:50.663 --> 09:53.399
Come on. Get up.
Get up.

09:53.533 --> 09:56.735
Hey! Bringing
the motherfucking smoke, homey!

09:56.869 --> 09:59.605
That's that East Side shit, nigga!

10:09.181 --> 10:11.851
Well, we have arrived.

10:16.590 --> 10:19.758
- Thanks, Nicky.
- Tell the doctor to suck that shit out of you, okay?

10:19.893 --> 10:22.862
Shut the fuck up, Calvin! Stupid ass.

10:22.995 --> 10:26.933
I don't know why you're
getting all high and mighty with me.

10:27.066 --> 10:30.936
You don't give a fuck about her. I don't
even know why you're acting all concerned.

10:31.070 --> 10:34.273
I'm not arguing about it.
Me and Jesse are going somewhere else.

10:34.407 --> 10:36.243
You can stay here
and raise your fucking baby,

10:36.375 --> 10:38.511
'cause I'm not
staying around for that shit.

10:38.644 --> 10:41.447
He's not getting the cape.
He is not getting it.

10:41.580 --> 10:44.484
We are all operating
on borrowed time.

10:44.617 --> 10:48.054
Dancing from dream to dream
in between nightmares,

10:48.187 --> 10:52.958
like little frightened children waiting
for our mothers to pick us up from school.

10:53.091 --> 10:57.497
And she's gonna ask us,
"What kind of day did you have?"

11:02.801 --> 11:06.071
Five-O! Five-O! Run!

11:06.205 --> 11:08.340
Come on, man! Run!

11:11.311 --> 11:14.614
<i>Get up!</i>

11:14.748 --> 11:18.752
<i>Yeah! Get some! Get some!</i>

11:18.884 --> 11:21.653
<i>Yeah. What you want?
Come here. Come here.</i>

11:21.787 --> 11:24.490
- <i>Don't let him go.</i>
- <i>Whup his ass.</i>

11:31.230 --> 11:35.734
Okay, would you rather have peas
for the rest of your life or broccoli?

11:35.868 --> 11:39.372
- Broccoli.
- Okay, would you rather have chicken or steak?

11:39.504 --> 11:42.676
- Steak.
- I knew you were gonna say steak.

11:54.787 --> 11:57.724
- What up, Shawn?
- Welcome back, homey.

11:57.856 --> 12:00.926
- You need your yard cut?
- Nah. Nah, I'm good.

12:01.060 --> 12:02.296
All right.

12:24.484 --> 12:26.787
Damn, Greg.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.924
It's been a minute.
When'd you get out?

12:31.056 --> 12:33.793
Uh, shit.
What, a week ago.

12:34.893 --> 12:37.964
You look good.
You look real good.

12:38.098 --> 12:40.499
I mean, I know there's nothing
else to do but lift inside,

12:40.633 --> 12:42.134
but it's working for you.

12:42.268 --> 12:43.869
Yeah, you know.

12:44.003 --> 12:49.209
Uh, so I seen there was some oil
up under your car in the street.

12:49.341 --> 12:51.477
They hook you up
with a job yet?

12:51.610 --> 12:55.047
I'm still on the wait list, but,
you know, I'm out here, doing me.

12:55.181 --> 12:57.718
Yeah. Yeah.
Good for you, baby.

12:58.884 --> 13:00.052
Uh...

13:00.787 --> 13:02.522
if you need a tune-up
or something,

13:02.654 --> 13:04.990
you know, whatever you can
afford, it's cool.

13:05.124 --> 13:10.596
Thanks, but truth is,
I'm kind of tight on cash these days.

13:12.598 --> 13:14.700
- But, um...
- I hear you.

13:14.834 --> 13:17.770
You need your hair braided?
On me.

13:17.903 --> 13:21.407
I don't think it's there quite yet.
A few months, maybe.

13:21.541 --> 13:23.010
Yeah. Almost.

13:23.810 --> 13:24.944
Girl.

13:26.713 --> 13:28.281
All right.

13:28.415 --> 13:30.383
- Uh...
- When it is, come back and see me.

13:30.516 --> 13:32.185
On me, for old times.

13:32.317 --> 13:33.819
All right then.

13:35.122 --> 13:36.556
Be careful.

13:37.290 --> 13:39.593
- It was good seeing you.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:40.792 --> 13:41.961
Bye.

13:52.172 --> 13:54.040
You smooth, baby.

13:58.144 --> 14:02.615
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Wait.
Slow the fuck down.

14:03.984 --> 14:08.354
Oh. Us? Me?

14:09.689 --> 14:12.859
Fuck. Yeah.

14:16.963 --> 14:18.998
Fuck you!

14:32.211 --> 14:36.115
You're fucking scared.
Fly away, bitch! Fly away!

14:38.183 --> 14:41.453
That motherfucker ain't right, Nicky.
What is that shit? I'm serious.

14:41.588 --> 14:43.489
Hey, hey. Wait up.
Listen, wait up...

14:43.623 --> 14:46.559
Nicky, I can't get no abortion,
and I'm tired of Calvin saying that shit.

14:46.692 --> 14:48.561
He's just fucking with
you, all right?

14:48.695 --> 14:50.028
I'm gonna take care of it.
Don't worry.

14:50.162 --> 14:52.031
He ain't gonna
take care of shit.

14:52.163 --> 14:55.734
Get your cracker ass outta here
before my slipper goes to slapping.

14:55.869 --> 14:58.870
Hey, Curtis, come on out here.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

14:59.004 --> 15:02.475
- Wait!
- You white-trash, Seabiscuit-lookin' motherfucker.

15:02.608 --> 15:04.643
We got all these
beautiful Black kings

15:04.777 --> 15:06.812
- and you open your legs up to white trash.
- Go sit down.

15:06.946 --> 15:09.715
Hey, tell your mama check in with the homeys.

15:09.849 --> 15:12.652
She still working nights?
Hey, Nicky.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.888
Better not come
back around here no more.

15:15.021 --> 15:17.457
Mm-mmm.
No, I'm not having it.

15:17.590 --> 15:19.893
- You in trouble.
- I can't do it.

15:24.730 --> 15:27.768
- Hey, man, what you up to?
- 'Sup, bro?

15:30.170 --> 15:35.709
Fucking bitch. Shut the fuck up.

16:07.205 --> 16:10.277
- <i>How you doing?</i>
- <i>You know what they call me, baby.</i>

16:10.409 --> 16:12.477
- Yo, what's up?
- Now you come home.

16:12.611 --> 16:13.945
This what's going on
when I'm at work?

16:14.080 --> 16:15.849
- What's good?
- Hey, Dad.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.652
Fuck you up.
Sit the fuck down!

16:19.786 --> 16:22.321
- Nicky, stop!
- Stay there!

16:22.455 --> 16:23.989
Fucking stop, Nicky.

16:24.124 --> 16:25.990
- Stay there, Nicky.
- What's wrong with you?

16:27.058 --> 16:29.795
- Sit the fuck down, bitch! Shut the fuck up!
- Nicky, stop!

16:30.997 --> 16:33.867
- Fuck 'em.
- Nicky, stop. Don't be stupid. Nicky, stop.

16:37.369 --> 16:38.638
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

Oh, fuck, man!

17:39.898 --> 17:41.434
They're supposed to be

17:41.567 --> 17:44.271
Little motherfucker got a
bomb lollipop on his face.

17:45.205 --> 17:47.273
Look at that nigga

18:45.365 --> 18:48.368
That nigga ain't got

18:49.769 --> 18:51.470
Look at special needs
little nigga over there.

18:51.603 --> 18:54.773
If he was trapped in the crib on

Nigga just be crisp.

Fuck you up, nigga.

20:09.215 --> 20:10.417
Whoa.

20:12.650 --> 20:14.019
Oh, shit.

20:17.723 --> 20:22.195
That's the fucking ocean breeze calling us.
You feel that shit?

20:23.128 --> 20:24.496
We going to the beach
this week.

20:24.629 --> 20:26.898
We're going to the
fucking beach this week!

20:27.032 --> 20:29.436
All right! Let's go!

21:04.137 --> 21:06.572
- <i>Slow down! Get out of the way!</i>
- <i>Watch where you goin'!</i>

21:12.712 --> 21:14.981
- Restart that shit.
- Oh, come on, bro.

21:15.113 --> 21:17.348
Restart

21:20.352 --> 21:21.786
My shit on?

21:28.194 --> 21:31.998
Oh, shit.
Holy shit.

21:35.701 --> 21:37.437
<i>Calvin had an idea.</i>

21:40.106 --> 21:43.042
<i>He said why don't we
take the game outside?</i>

21:44.709 --> 21:46.446
<i>Now, I knew
what he meant.</i>

21:46.579 --> 21:47.879
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

21:48.013 --> 21:49.782
<i>And I can't say
I disagreed with him.</i>

21:52.985 --> 21:55.287
<i>But had I known
what it would lead to,</i>

21:56.421 --> 21:59.524
<i>I probably would have
just said, "Let's stay home."</i>

21:59.658 --> 22:02.262
...with the young bitches
with the yoga pants.

22:02.395 --> 22:06.498
And we turn them bitches all the way
the fuck up! We turn them bitches up!

22:06.631 --> 22:09.901
And we go on this wild ride in the
sky like Superman and come back down

22:10.034 --> 22:12.403
with some Offwhite, too,
mixed up, fixed up,

22:12.538 --> 22:15.007
rolled up with some Sour OG
and we only do switches.

22:15.139 --> 22:17.309
We only do
motherfucking switches.

22:17.443 --> 22:20.046
And I need me some Slurpee.
I need a Slurpee. Slurpee got some juice.

22:20.178 --> 22:22.915
Want some fucking juice. I could do

22:23.049 --> 22:25.751
That shit just be... The motherfucking
flavor! Know what I'm sayin'?

22:25.885 --> 22:28.287
No air traffic control,
just stratosphere.

22:28.420 --> 22:32.023
And then we just fucking take
a ride in the air, like, whoo!

22:32.157 --> 22:33.993
And we just... go!

22:34.127 --> 22:36.963
You know what I'm saying?
Just us and the wind.

22:37.096 --> 22:39.566
Nigga, that shit

22:45.771 --> 22:48.340
Greg,

22:50.944 --> 22:53.446
Check out this nigga,
Crackhead Leonard.

22:55.481 --> 22:57.183
What's up with that bread
you owe me, man?

22:57.315 --> 22:59.384
Oh, come on, man.
There you go again!

22:59.517 --> 23:02.153
You ain't getting it, nigga.

23:02.288 --> 23:06.092
- And this weird-ass nigga.
- Oh, shit. Look who got out.

23:06.225 --> 23:07.826
What's up, homey?

23:07.959 --> 23:12.698
Hey, shit, nigga. Come holler at me.

23:12.831 --> 23:15.234
Fuck he doing

23:17.503 --> 23:19.539
Whose lawn mower
you just stole?

23:20.974 --> 23:23.141
Jesus?
You stole Jesus's lawn mower?

23:23.274 --> 23:25.843
I'm riding out here, nigga.

23:25.977 --> 23:29.948
I heard there was some snitching going on.
Now you out early?

23:30.081 --> 23:31.984
Rolled up.

23:32.117 --> 23:34.052
Out here trying to make a dime.
You feel me?

23:34.186 --> 23:36.422
I'm fuckin' with you.
I know.

23:37.857 --> 23:40.158
- You look good, boy.
- I'm all right.

23:40.292 --> 23:43.263
- Trying to make a dime, huh?
- You got some work here?

23:44.329 --> 23:46.099
You got some work
I can do?

23:47.599 --> 23:50.636
I got work all day.
You trying to get back on?

23:50.769 --> 23:52.605
Nah, dawg.

23:52.737 --> 23:54.439
Going straight.

23:54.572 --> 23:57.643
Got some work I can do around
the yard that you need?

23:58.843 --> 24:00.745
Nah, I like
all my weeds.

24:01.780 --> 24:05.384
Right here looking like Jurassic Park.

24:05.516 --> 24:08.386
Hold up. Yo, Jasmine.
You see my homey right here?

24:08.520 --> 24:10.888
Ask the nigga if he wants some food.
You can't make him a plate?

24:11.023 --> 24:13.492
- I'm cool, dawg. I'm cool. It's cool.
- You cool?

24:13.625 --> 24:15.694
You ain't got no manners
about yourself.

24:15.828 --> 24:18.597
- Yo mama burn that shit up, dawg. I'm all right.
- You cool?

24:18.730 --> 24:21.267
- Yeah.
- Why don't you take this bread then?

24:22.534 --> 24:26.004
Dawg. I'm away.
You feel me?

24:29.640 --> 24:30.976
I see you.

24:32.778 --> 24:34.113
I see you.

24:36.715 --> 24:40.152
Just let me know if you need something.
Anything.

24:41.587 --> 24:43.022
Sure. All right.

24:45.690 --> 24:48.426
- Gonna put some rims on it?
- Hey, dawg, don't be...

24:57.003 --> 25:01.807
Our father,
who art on my back...

25:01.939 --> 25:05.409
- I'ma stay outside. Owner don't like Bruiser.
- ...wretched be your name.

25:06.445 --> 25:10.849
Thy kingdom come,
your shit gets done on Earth.

25:10.983 --> 25:14.320
And wherever else you can
make a fucking dollar, right?

25:17.689 --> 25:21.292
Sin is encrouched
at your door, young man.

25:21.426 --> 25:27.065
And for you is its appetite.
Will you get the mastery over it?

25:32.804 --> 25:36.441
- You steal! You stole me!
- I'm gonna take a piss.

25:36.576 --> 25:39.578
You took me from my mama.
You stole me!

25:39.712 --> 25:42.682
And you promised me
a fucking mule!

25:43.682 --> 25:45.718
Where's
my motherfucking mule?

25:49.221 --> 25:54.794
I'm that nigga that's left the pawn
shop, and I got a gun.

25:57.096 --> 25:58.631
Hey, what's up, bro?

26:00.264 --> 26:02.368
- What's good?
- I like your hat.

26:12.744 --> 26:17.649
The keys! Calvin, the keys!
Give me the keys.

27:14.138 --> 27:15.875
<i>Calvin, you hear me?</i>

27:20.411 --> 27:24.048
- <i>You brush your teeth today?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

27:24.183 --> 27:27.653
Can't be leaving the house smelling
like these other little niggas out here.

27:27.785 --> 27:32.157
There's things that separate us.
Truth or lies. That's it.

27:33.559 --> 27:35.595
The truth is who you are.
You hear me?

27:37.596 --> 27:39.532
<i>A lie is everything else.</i>

27:43.936 --> 27:47.305
<i>I'm still putting together that
spaceship for you. Know that?</i>

27:47.439 --> 27:49.241
<i>Fly wherever
you want to go.</i>

27:50.642 --> 27:53.845
It's gonna run
off pure energy.

27:58.216 --> 28:01.619
Oh, shit!

28:01.753 --> 28:06.425
I fucking love you.
Thank you. Whoo!

28:09.361 --> 28:11.229
Whoo! Whoo!

28:11.362 --> 28:14.131
Think, motherfuckers.

28:14.265 --> 28:17.570
Oh, sh...

28:19.170 --> 28:20.705
Gimme
the motherfuckin' pill.

28:20.840 --> 28:22.573
- Did you get those pills?
- Yeah, I got 'em.

28:22.707 --> 28:24.709
- Who got the pills? Oh, you got 'em.
- I ate 'em all!

28:24.842 --> 28:28.312
Kiss it goodbye till next time.

28:28.446 --> 28:31.950
Till next time! Boom!

28:37.622 --> 28:39.490
<i>Okay,
would you rather have peas</i>

28:39.625 --> 28:41.627
<i>for the rest of your life
or broccoli?</i>

28:41.760 --> 28:45.564
- Broccoli.
- Okay, would you rather have chicken or steak?

28:45.697 --> 28:49.634
- Steak.
- I knew you were gonna say steak.

28:49.767 --> 28:52.370
I'll be right back.
Going to the bathroom. Stay right here.

28:52.504 --> 28:54.340
- Okay.
- Okay? I love you.

29:01.112 --> 29:03.247
Hey, look at
this asshole.

29:04.116 --> 29:06.652
Can't believe
he's still running shit.

29:26.805 --> 29:28.440
What you got there?

29:31.009 --> 29:33.546
What's that, like,
an upside-down chicken?

29:38.917 --> 29:42.355
Okay, that's what I want.
I'm starving.

29:46.157 --> 29:49.995
Got the prettiest ears.
Come on.

29:52.398 --> 29:53.898
Come on.

29:58.270 --> 30:00.004
Yeah.

30:04.743 --> 30:08.179
Hey! Hey, get the fuck
away from their window!

30:08.312 --> 30:10.582
Hello? Get over here!

30:10.715 --> 30:14.119
Nigga, don't act like you don't hear me.
I will call 911, motherfucker.

30:14.252 --> 30:18.491
Get over here. What do you think
you're doing over here in their window?

30:20.725 --> 30:23.529
Calvin!
Get the... Calvin!

30:23.661 --> 30:26.965
Calvin, dawg!
Get the fuck over here.

30:27.099 --> 30:29.467
The fuck is wrong with you?
I'm looking at life right now.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.936
- It's Jesse, dawg.
- What'd you just say?

30:32.071 --> 30:36.707
- Fuck! Fuck!
- What the fuck you just say? What's wrong with Jesse?

30:36.841 --> 30:38.976
- He saw it through a fucking window!
- What are you talking about?

30:39.110 --> 30:41.178
Mr. Charlie is fucking Jesse!
That's what's happening!

30:41.312 --> 30:44.782
Fucking kill him! I'ma fucking kill him.
I'ma fucking kill him.

30:44.917 --> 30:48.052
He's fucking him, man!
Come on, Nicky! Come on!

30:48.186 --> 30:50.723
Let's go! Let's go!

30:51.223 --> 30:52.424
Jesse!

30:52.557 --> 30:55.461
I'ma kill him!
I'ma fucking kill him!

30:55.593 --> 30:57.228
Where the fuck is...

30:57.361 --> 31:00.364
Have you seen my son? Have you seen him?
He was right here! Aaron!

31:00.498 --> 31:02.667
- Jesse!
- Where the fuck are you?

31:02.801 --> 31:04.570
- <i>Aaron!</i>
- <i>Jesse!</i>

31:04.703 --> 31:07.773
- <i>Aaron! Aaron!</i>
- I don't fucking know!

31:07.906 --> 31:10.742
<i>Have you seen my son?
A little boy?</i>

31:10.876 --> 31:13.011
Jesse!

31:13.145 --> 31:16.182
- Aaron! Oh, my God! Aaron!
- Jesse!

31:16.314 --> 31:19.118
Jesse!

31:37.802 --> 31:40.338
You see that shit?
Do you see that shit?

31:40.472 --> 31:44.542
When we was younger, was he doing
this shit the whole fucking time? Huh?

31:44.676 --> 31:46.477
I don't fucking know.

31:46.611 --> 31:48.779
I don't fucking know.
I don't fucking know.

31:48.914 --> 31:51.750
- Jesse doesn't say anything.
- All right. We gotta have a plan.

31:52.917 --> 31:57.423
Piece of shit. Piece of shit.
That disgusting piece of shit.

31:59.457 --> 32:01.593
That motherfucker is dead.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.162
He's fucking dead.

32:48.706 --> 32:50.876
<i>I always have the same dream.</i>

32:52.276 --> 32:54.912
<i>In it,
there's three palm trees.</i>

32:55.647 --> 32:58.751
<i>Like three really tall friends.</i>

33:00.586 --> 33:02.455
<i>But then I'm alone...</i>

33:04.122 --> 33:05.924
<i>by the ocean.</i>

33:07.827 --> 33:10.162
<i>My feet
feeling the cool water.</i>

33:15.801 --> 33:17.269
<i>Dreams ain't real.</i>

33:25.043 --> 33:28.680
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, what you doing back here?

33:29.747 --> 33:32.717
- Trying to get it right.
- Get what right?

33:34.886 --> 33:36.955
Oh, you need
your own little space.

33:37.088 --> 33:39.992
Just need a place...
place for my own, Mama.

33:40.125 --> 33:43.829
Mm-hmm. Just don't make a bigger
mess than is already back here.

33:43.962 --> 33:47.333
You wanna maybe roll with me
to the hardware store later?

33:47.465 --> 33:51.069
Sure, we can do that.
You want something to eat first?

33:52.204 --> 33:57.042
Oh. My cooking's okay for
you, but my house isn't.

33:57.175 --> 33:58.543
Hey, hey. You know.

34:01.612 --> 34:04.215
- Love you, too.
- Thank you, Mama.

34:04.350 --> 34:06.051
You're welcome, sweetie.

34:13.023 --> 34:15.259
- We gotta take Keisha to the doctor tomorrow.
- Uh-uh!

34:15.393 --> 34:18.697
- Don't forget.
- Uh-uh! Fuck no. I'm not doing that shit.

34:18.830 --> 34:20.565
Oh, don't start with that.
Come on.

34:20.699 --> 34:22.434
- No, I'm not doing that shit.
- We agreed.

34:22.567 --> 34:26.237
No, we didn't agree on shit.
That's your business. Your business.

34:26.371 --> 34:30.175
- Come on, General.
- General? I'm fucking viceroy. Get that shit right.

34:30.308 --> 34:32.777
Hey,
why aren't you the king again?

34:32.911 --> 34:35.380
I'm working my way to the fucking top.
All right?

34:35.514 --> 34:38.817
The nerve of some people. You really want
to live this regular fucking lifestyle?

34:38.951 --> 34:43.688
You wanna raise a baby in this shit?
This shithole? Dumbass.

34:46.257 --> 34:49.360
Oh, shit, you smell that?
You fucking smell that?

34:49.493 --> 34:51.228
You smell that shit?

34:51.362 --> 34:56.234
- It's fucking intrigue, my nigga.
- Mmm. Oh, shit.

34:58.837 --> 35:00.138
We're going to the beach!

35:00.272 --> 35:02.840
You hear me?
We're going to the beach!

35:02.975 --> 35:04.976
Taking motherfucking
my nigga Jesse,

35:05.110 --> 35:08.179
my white friend Nicky
to the fucking beach.

35:25.763 --> 35:30.902
<i>♪ We going to the beach We going to
the beach We going to the beach ♪</i>

35:31.036 --> 35:33.271
<i>♪ They all gon' see us
In the street ♪</i>

35:36.842 --> 35:40.045
- You motherfuckers ready? You see this shit?
- Ow!

35:40.179 --> 35:43.314
Soon as I see me a dolphin,
I'm jumping clean on his back.

35:44.181 --> 35:47.185
Clean on it.
Dolphins, where you at?

35:49.319 --> 35:51.956
Fuck you! Who the fuck is that?

35:52.089 --> 35:53.992
Go around!

35:54.625 --> 35:57.061
Keep it cool.

35:57.194 --> 36:00.098
- Yo, all right.
- Oh, are you fucking kidding me, bro?

36:00.232 --> 36:03.502
Go the fuck around. This bi...

36:03.634 --> 36:05.602
- What the fuck are you dumb shits doing?
- Fuck you!

36:05.737 --> 36:08.974
- You don't wanna fuck with me.
- Get your fucking ass back!

36:09.107 --> 36:10.676
Fuck you!
Why don't you fucking go?

36:10.808 --> 36:12.476
- Fucking peasants, man!
- I like my fucking car.

36:12.610 --> 36:15.180
- Let's get out of here.
- Bitch, I'ma fuck him up. Fuck him up.

36:15.313 --> 36:19.051
<i>Calvin? Calvin, you hear me?</i>

36:20.252 --> 36:22.286
<i>I asked you what you want,
not what you like.</i>

36:22.420 --> 36:25.223
<i>Nobody give a damn
about what you like.</i>

36:26.391 --> 36:28.761
<i>You gotta tell the
motherfucker what you want.</i>

36:29.560 --> 36:31.196
Now say it.

36:31.328 --> 36:33.597
- I want ice cream.
- Say it like you want some.

36:33.730 --> 36:35.466
I want some ice cream.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.302
- I want that fucking car. I'ma fuck you up.
- Let's get that fucker.

36:38.436 --> 36:39.737
Dolphins gonna have to wait.

36:39.871 --> 36:42.306
Yeah. Yeah.

36:44.909 --> 36:46.878
Now this nigga
trying to speed off.

36:47.011 --> 36:50.148
I'm running that light.
You thought I was stopping.

36:50.281 --> 36:53.584
What the hell do they want?

36:53.717 --> 36:59.022
Make me stop in the street 'cause you
don't know how to say you want some shit.

36:59.156 --> 37:00.758
Now I'm pulled the fuck over.

37:00.893 --> 37:04.128
- We got a possible 503.
- You stay in that spot. Don't you move.

37:04.261 --> 37:07.865
Sir, get out of the car.
Hands where I can see them!

37:08.000 --> 37:10.435
Fuck you, fuck you,
fuck you.

37:10.567 --> 37:12.870
- What you want, man?
- Put your hands where I can see them!

37:13.003 --> 37:14.940
I'm talking to my son
in the car.

37:15.072 --> 37:17.908
- Back up! I said back up!
- What you gonna do? Shoot me?

37:21.179 --> 37:23.948
<i>Don't you forget
that shit. You understand me?</i>

37:24.083 --> 37:26.118
Let's fucking do this shit.
Come on.

37:32.590 --> 37:37.563
<i>Chéri, chéri. Chéri,</i> look.
Do you love it? Tell me you love it.

37:37.696 --> 37:39.429
Hello.

37:39.563 --> 37:40.965
Fuck!

37:41.098 --> 37:43.567
Get the fuck out of my house!

37:43.701 --> 37:45.136
Oh, my gosh.

37:49.074 --> 37:50.475
Pull your ass up!

37:51.442 --> 37:55.112
- Who's the fucking peasant now?
- Hmm?

37:55.246 --> 37:56.514
Get off me!

38:07.692 --> 38:09.761
Fuck you!

38:19.571 --> 38:22.174
Fuck yeah.
I told you, that's my shit.

38:22.306 --> 38:24.475
- That's your shit.
- I steal your fucking car.

38:24.609 --> 38:28.880
I told him. I said, "That's a nice
motherfucking Mercedes, bitch."

38:29.014 --> 38:30.815
- This is my shit now.
- That's your shit.

38:30.949 --> 38:32.850
Now we driving to the beach
in his shit.

38:32.984 --> 38:34.485
Took his car.
You took his bitch.

38:34.618 --> 38:36.254
Took her away.

38:36.388 --> 38:41.025
"I got you something nice, baby.
Look at these beautiful flowers."

38:41.159 --> 38:45.397
Yo, look at Jesse. Look at Jesse.

38:45.529 --> 38:48.098
Hey, you like a motherfucking
rock star up there.

38:48.232 --> 38:50.200
- A fucking rock star.
- Yeah.

38:50.335 --> 38:52.737
- I need some liquor.
- Let's get something to drink.

38:52.871 --> 38:56.374
I need some liquor to bring these
pills down. I need to get sober.

39:01.413 --> 39:04.581
- Yo.
- You see that shit?

39:04.715 --> 39:06.150
See what?

39:06.284 --> 39:09.787
- 105, 405...
- Damn. They is the shit.

39:09.920 --> 39:11.956
<i>LA is funny.</i>

39:12.089 --> 39:15.960
<i>Tell somebody you're famous, even if they
don't know who you are, they get excited.</i>

39:17.429 --> 39:19.731
<i>Man, let's take these
motherfuckers for a ride.</i>

39:19.864 --> 39:21.833
Excuse me.

39:21.967 --> 39:23.602
Is that him?

39:25.936 --> 39:28.206
I mean, is that him,
like, for real?

39:29.873 --> 39:33.611
- Oh, yeah, that's him.
- It's fucking him. Sure it is.

39:33.744 --> 39:35.781
Um, can we go talk to him?

39:35.913 --> 39:38.850
Nah, nah, nah.
He just got out of the studio.

39:38.982 --> 39:40.418
- Doesn't like to be bothered.
- Oh, my God.

39:40.552 --> 39:42.854
I knew it. I told you
he was gonna make another album.

39:42.987 --> 39:44.489
So what are you ladies
doing tonight?

39:44.621 --> 39:48.125
Uh... we don't know.
We just got here this morning.

39:48.259 --> 39:49.994
Maybe go to a club
or something.

39:50.127 --> 39:51.830
Hell yeah.

39:51.962 --> 39:54.198
Let's party. Let's get out of here.
Leave your car here.

39:54.333 --> 39:56.032
- Where we going?
- Come on.

39:56.167 --> 39:58.670
The unknown, motherfucker.
Get in the car.

39:58.802 --> 40:00.938
Just get in the car.
Come on.

40:01.072 --> 40:04.643
We gonna get high tonight.
Yes, indeed.

40:04.775 --> 40:06.543
We gonna get high tonight.

40:08.513 --> 40:10.614
And I'm gonna let you
look right at me.

40:10.748 --> 40:14.252
I ain't scared. No.

40:15.686 --> 40:18.790
Laugh, motherfucker.
I ain't scared, man.

40:18.922 --> 40:22.293
'Cause I see you.
He sees you.

40:23.927 --> 40:27.799
Dare the devil to step aside.
Ask him to say your name.

40:27.933 --> 40:31.904
See which name he says.
You know his name.

40:34.038 --> 40:36.174
The po-po
ain't catching us.

40:36.308 --> 40:38.076
We got
a lot of shit in here.

40:38.210 --> 40:40.378
We got a lot of shit in here.

40:40.511 --> 40:43.380
This is cool, but y'all got anything harder?

40:43.514 --> 40:47.018
"Harder," the young man says.
Excellent, my dear Nicholas.

40:47.152 --> 40:49.186
I believe we've found
a colleague in recreation.

40:49.321 --> 40:54.926
Now, now, my dear comrade. We can't
assume that this is a man of leisure.

40:55.060 --> 40:57.596
He could be, uh,
an upstanding family man.

40:57.728 --> 41:00.866
Then more outstanding for the cause of this adventure.

41:00.998 --> 41:03.033
Surely, if his thirst
for the game is ample,

41:03.167 --> 41:06.871
then mere formalities will not intercede
and spoil the spirit of the night.

41:07.005 --> 41:10.442
Be chance or favor,

41:10.574 --> 41:13.076
I wager my own honor that
this man fancies the sport.

41:13.210 --> 41:18.149
All right, well, what does our governor
say about the night's festivities?

41:18.282 --> 41:19.384
Mmm.

41:20.217 --> 41:21.786
At last!

41:21.920 --> 41:26.057
The great oracle himself has spoken.
The game it shall be.

41:26.190 --> 41:29.593
- The game it shall be.
- Are we going to see the Hollywood sign?

41:29.726 --> 41:31.228
We so gotta get a pic.

41:31.362 --> 41:34.264
Fuck no.
We're gonna see the universe.

41:34.397 --> 41:36.566
Take a pill, baby.
What you having?

41:36.701 --> 41:38.270
Ooh. I'm having
what he's having.

41:38.402 --> 41:40.171
I want
what he's having too.

41:46.143 --> 41:49.380
Take this shit.
Take this fucking shit off.

41:50.281 --> 41:52.282
Fuck this sh...

41:52.417 --> 41:53.817
Fuck this sh...

41:53.951 --> 41:55.786
Yo, Calvin.

41:55.920 --> 41:59.725
- What you doing, man?
- Fuck. Fuck all this.

42:01.391 --> 42:04.795
Whoo!
Juicy booty. Juicy booty.

42:04.929 --> 42:06.630
Come here, girl, come here.

42:08.632 --> 42:11.735
What's up, Eddie?

44:33.143 --> 44:34.545
Yo!

44:39.717 --> 44:42.086
Hold your shit.
You're more fucked up than me.

44:42.219 --> 44:45.523
Yo! What the fuck?

44:46.824 --> 44:48.459
My bad.

44:48.592 --> 44:51.494
- It's all good, man.
- Fucking pull up your pants.

44:51.628 --> 44:56.400
Oh! I just saw your penis, man! What the...
I just saw your fucking penis!

44:56.534 --> 44:58.369
Jesse, Jesse, come on.

44:58.502 --> 45:00.572
Let's fucking go.
Let's fucking go.

45:02.239 --> 45:05.176
I love you.
Fucking cockblocker.

45:05.310 --> 45:07.913
I want ice cream now.
Let's go.

45:29.668 --> 45:30.801
Nicky?

45:30.935 --> 45:35.574
Nicky, Terry,
breakfast is almost ready. Come on.

45:38.308 --> 45:40.911
- Fuck.
- What are you doing?

45:41.045 --> 45:42.847
I can't find my phone.

45:49.821 --> 45:51.589
Is it
in these armpits of yours?

45:51.721 --> 45:53.924
Let me just check. Let me just check.

45:54.058 --> 45:56.761
Whoo! Bah!

45:56.893 --> 45:59.763
Boys, you're gonna be late!
Nicky, come on!

45:59.897 --> 46:01.099
Forget it.

46:01.232 --> 46:02.934
Let me ride, Nicky.

46:03.067 --> 46:05.270
Okay. Let's go.

46:05.402 --> 46:07.772
Let's get
some of that breakfast.

46:24.822 --> 46:30.928
Now... if-if-if four-fifths
of the world is dark,

46:31.061 --> 46:34.598
how is it that...
how is it possible that one-fifth

46:34.732 --> 46:40.404
rules or oppresses
or exploits or dominates

46:40.538 --> 46:43.440
that four-fifths
who are the majority?

46:43.574 --> 46:46.511
It's by dividing
and conquering.

46:51.581 --> 46:54.752
We're not brutalized
because we're Baptist.

46:55.652 --> 46:58.822
We're not brutalized
because we're Methodist.

46:59.656 --> 47:02.426
We're not brutalized
because we're Muslim.

47:09.668 --> 47:14.639
We're brutalized because
we are Black people in America.

47:54.212 --> 47:55.547
Take it easy.

47:56.279 --> 47:59.816
Arthritis.

47:59.951 --> 48:02.353
- Thank goodness it stopped raining.
- I got it. I got it.

48:02.485 --> 48:04.388
I did...

48:04.522 --> 48:06.489
I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

48:06.623 --> 48:09.460
- Okay. Okay, sweetie.
- Here's your keys.

48:12.429 --> 48:13.897
Hey, Calvin.

48:17.902 --> 48:19.137
Calvin, yo.

48:21.473 --> 48:23.708
I need to talk to you, boy.

48:26.143 --> 48:28.879
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, Mama. It's all right.

48:31.114 --> 48:33.850
<i>I think
in that moment for Calvin,</i>

48:33.984 --> 48:36.554
<i>it was the straw
that broke the camel's back.</i>

48:38.221 --> 48:40.424
<i>The promises of his life,</i>

48:41.491 --> 48:44.561
<i>the beginning
of all things broken.</i>

48:44.696 --> 48:49.500
<i>The doctors,
they told me Calvin was special.</i>

48:51.536 --> 48:53.938
<i>They weren't sure
of his condition.</i>

48:54.871 --> 48:59.710
The outbursts,
the violence, the mood swings.

49:06.116 --> 49:07.819
<i>What was I gonna do?</i>

49:08.953 --> 49:13.023
So I prayed to the Lord
for... for answers.

49:15.326 --> 49:19.097
And I'll keep on praying till
the Lord answers my prayers.

49:56.734 --> 49:59.335
- You think it's time to take a break?
- Oh, Mama.

50:02.772 --> 50:05.709
I thought you might
want a beer, baby.

50:07.944 --> 50:09.080
A beer?

50:09.212 --> 50:12.448
Yes, Mama drinks a beer
every now and again.

50:12.583 --> 50:14.118
Cheers.

50:16.219 --> 50:18.989
- Mmm.
- You all the way gangsta now, huh?

50:20.023 --> 50:22.125
Got your beer,
got your crib.

50:22.259 --> 50:24.494
I ain't mad.

50:24.628 --> 50:25.795
Oh, you're not mad at me?

50:25.929 --> 50:28.632
You got any papers?

50:29.900 --> 50:33.037
- Oh, you trippin'.
- Gotcha.

50:36.473 --> 50:39.843
Yeah, it's getting there.
It's on its way.

50:39.978 --> 50:41.713
'Bout how much longer?

50:42.547 --> 50:45.049
- Soon.
- Mm-hmm.

50:46.282 --> 50:49.987
I'm gettin' ready to go to the store.
Want anything in particular?

50:50.121 --> 50:53.624
- PB&J.
- So nothing's changed.

50:53.757 --> 50:56.460
Why you asking
if you already know?

50:56.592 --> 50:58.228
- Extra crunchy?
- Extra crunchy.

50:58.362 --> 51:01.065
I'm just checking. I thought
maybe you growed up or something.

51:01.197 --> 51:05.036
- Nah.
- Okay, baby. Love you.

52:00.590 --> 52:01.926
Calvin?

52:02.793 --> 52:05.330
I got you this
for your birthday.

52:06.964 --> 52:11.969
I was gonna give it to you then,
but I thought maybe you could use it now.

52:22.480 --> 52:23.715
Go on.

52:24.815 --> 52:26.884
I think
you're gonna like it.

52:50.806 --> 52:52.109
Can I help you?

52:56.346 --> 52:57.681
Okay.

52:59.350 --> 53:00.750
Here we go.

53:00.884 --> 53:03.087
Right around your shoulders.

53:03.219 --> 53:04.888
Ohh.

53:07.058 --> 53:10.395
Oh, the collar
and the button.

53:13.364 --> 53:14.866
It's so royal.

53:17.567 --> 53:20.071
Look. Take your arms out.

54:08.052 --> 54:11.756
You're such a good boy.
You're a good boy, Calvin.

54:14.657 --> 54:16.993
I need you
to watch Terry tonight.

54:19.929 --> 54:23.866
All right, I'll handle it, but
that's, like, three nights this week.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.168
Don't you worry about
what I do with my nights.

54:26.302 --> 54:29.373
You need to be worried about how you're gonna
feed that baby you're supposed to be having.

54:29.507 --> 54:31.309
It's sorted.

54:32.775 --> 54:35.446
- I'm just saying, Nicky...
- You're just saying what?

54:35.578 --> 54:37.347
I'm just saying.

54:37.480 --> 54:41.551
It ain't easy being
a fucking parent. Shit's hard.

54:41.685 --> 54:43.621
And how the fuck
would you know?

54:43.753 --> 54:46.424
Watch your fucking mouth.

54:50.960 --> 54:53.263
Say, nigga! Cal!

55:00.737 --> 55:02.105
Been looking
for you, boy.

55:02.239 --> 55:04.308
<i>Things reversed for Calvin.</i>

55:05.442 --> 55:07.478
<i>When he looked up,
he saw the ground.</i>

55:07.610 --> 55:10.147
<i>When he looked down,
he saw the sky.</i>

55:13.650 --> 55:16.453
<i>We know he buried his hope
with Bruiser.</i>

55:32.668 --> 55:34.404
So, you gonna jump?

55:39.377 --> 55:40.444
Yeah.

55:41.210 --> 55:42.645
All right.

55:42.779 --> 55:45.215
- Good luck, nigga.
- Imagine that shit.

55:46.884 --> 55:50.353
But jump to what?
The fucking ground?

55:50.487 --> 55:52.190
No, fuck the ground.

55:54.757 --> 55:56.259
Give me that cigarette.

55:57.228 --> 56:01.199
What you doing up here?
Trying to get closer to God?

56:02.933 --> 56:04.335
Fucking God.
I keep hearing that shit.

56:04.467 --> 56:07.737
Like, where is the motherfucker?
I ain't met the guy.

56:08.839 --> 56:11.041
No, I'm going to fucking Venus.
That's where I'm going.

56:11.174 --> 56:15.478
- The planet? Nigga, gimme this.
- Yes, the planet. That's where I'm going.

56:17.714 --> 56:19.248
How you gonna get there?

56:19.382 --> 56:21.518
You don't see
what the fuck I got on?

56:21.652 --> 56:23.753
- My bad. That's what's up with the cape?
- Exactly.

56:23.888 --> 56:26.690
- I'm tripping. My bad.
- Exactly. Got to stay off the fucking ground.

56:26.822 --> 56:28.058
Ground hot like hell.

56:28.192 --> 56:30.226
They try to say
hell is underneath ground

56:30.360 --> 56:32.728
and fire and pits
and all that devil bullshit.

56:32.862 --> 56:34.598
No, it's right fucking here.

56:34.732 --> 56:36.699
I seen the devil himself.
I talked to the nigga.

56:36.833 --> 56:39.670
He's right here.
He live around the fucking corner.

56:39.802 --> 56:41.672
- Right here?
- Yes.

56:41.806 --> 56:44.875
For example, when you hit that
motherfucker, he was already dead.

56:45.009 --> 56:48.078
- Did you know that? You were hitting a corpse.
- Don't talk about that.

56:48.210 --> 56:50.747
You hit that nigga.
He was gone, like, boom!

56:50.880 --> 56:53.984
The nigga was ash when he hit the ground.
That shit was wild.

56:54.116 --> 56:56.652
- You think that shit cool?
- Yeah, I thought that shit was fuckin' cool.

57:00.891 --> 57:03.827
- You scared to die, Greg, ain't you?
- I'm saying don't rush it.

57:03.960 --> 57:06.129
You scared to die and shit.

57:07.598 --> 57:09.065
Don't rush it?

57:10.433 --> 57:12.502
Then I guess
you ain't heard.

57:13.636 --> 57:15.205
Heard what, dawg?

57:19.275 --> 57:21.177
I'm already dead.

57:45.802 --> 57:47.371
Hey.

57:51.409 --> 57:53.310
What's with this mess?

57:54.078 --> 57:56.647
Looks like
a little piggy lives here.

57:57.748 --> 57:59.917
Hey. Jesse.

58:00.051 --> 58:02.052
Fuck.

58:04.788 --> 58:06.357
Hey, you in there?

58:14.498 --> 58:15.799
Jesse.

58:15.933 --> 58:19.170
Why'd you lock the door?
Come on. Open the door.

58:20.904 --> 58:22.304
You...

58:22.438 --> 58:25.009
What's going on?
You all right?

58:27.444 --> 58:30.080
Hey, Jesse, don't fucking
walk away from me.

58:30.214 --> 58:32.148
Goddamn it.
You little prick.

58:32.282 --> 58:34.317
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

58:42.592 --> 58:45.763
Jesus Christ.
Look what you made me do.

58:49.299 --> 58:51.967
Calvin! The fucker's here!
We gotta go.

58:52.101 --> 58:56.306
Get your shit together. Okay?
I'm gonna give you some space.

58:56.440 --> 58:59.176
I spent 30 fucking dollars
on groceries.

59:24.835 --> 59:26.203
Fuck you.

59:33.110 --> 59:34.077
Jesse!

59:34.210 --> 59:36.346
- Jesse, open the door!
- Open up.

59:38.114 --> 59:39.148
You okay?

59:39.281 --> 59:41.818
Hey, hey, hey.

59:41.951 --> 59:42.886
Hey.

59:43.020 --> 59:45.489
You all good?
Look at me.

59:45.621 --> 59:46.822
What the fuck?

59:46.956 --> 59:48.991
Get him a fucking shirt.

59:49.125 --> 59:50.694
Almost fucking had him.

59:52.228 --> 59:54.764
Let's get the fuck
out of here, okay?

59:59.101 --> 01:00:00.837
It's not your fault, man.

01:00:02.005 --> 01:00:03.441
You know that, right?

01:00:04.674 --> 01:00:05.842
You know that.

01:00:06.777 --> 01:00:08.211
<i>Aaron?</i>

01:00:08.344 --> 01:00:09.980
You're not alone anymore
about this.

01:00:10.112 --> 01:00:11.482
- <i>You understand me?</i>
- <i>Aaron!</i>

01:00:11.614 --> 01:00:16.419
- Jesse? Jesse? Look at me. Come on, bro.
- <i>Aaron?</i>

01:00:17.186 --> 01:00:19.355
<i>Look at me, man. Come on.</i>

01:00:19.489 --> 01:00:22.558
<i>Aaron! Aaron!
Oh, my God, Aaron!</i>

01:00:22.692 --> 01:00:23.993
Look at me.

01:00:25.127 --> 01:00:29.699
You're not alone.
We're gonna handle it. Okay?

01:00:40.743 --> 01:00:42.946
Here.
This is the part I like. Watch.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.648
Oh, my gosh!
I love that.

01:00:45.781 --> 01:00:47.684
Mom, you're wild.

01:00:47.817 --> 01:00:49.552
She used to be, son.

01:00:49.685 --> 01:00:52.589
Really, Charles?

01:00:54.792 --> 01:00:57.661
<i>When the asylum
lets you out into the world</i>

01:00:57.795 --> 01:01:00.297
<i>of pain and trouble,
and you ask,</i>

01:01:00.431 --> 01:01:03.400
<i>who's responsible
for this hell?</i>

01:01:03.534 --> 01:01:06.770
<i>Who's responsible
for my misery?</i>

01:01:10.507 --> 01:01:12.775
Oh, my gosh.

01:01:12.909 --> 01:01:14.244
I'll get it.

01:01:14.377 --> 01:01:15.944
<i>Where's God?</i>

01:01:16.078 --> 01:01:18.715
<i>Jesse, where is God?</i>

01:01:22.118 --> 01:01:23.821
Is your dad home?

01:01:23.953 --> 01:01:25.921
- Dad?
- Oh, my God!

01:01:26.056 --> 01:01:27.357
Shut the fuck up.

01:01:27.491 --> 01:01:29.927
<i>God is looking for you.
Where is God?</i>

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.529
Shut the fuck up.

01:01:32.663 --> 01:01:35.032
- <i>Are y'all listening to me?</i>
- Shut the fuck up.

01:01:35.632 --> 01:01:37.167
- Stop!
- Shut the fuck up.

01:01:37.299 --> 01:01:38.334
- Take anything.
- Shut up.

01:01:38.469 --> 01:01:39.802
<i>You gotta find him out here!</i>

01:01:39.935 --> 01:01:41.337
Great motherfucking year!

01:01:41.471 --> 01:01:44.107
<i>Does God put his children
in bondage?</i>

01:01:44.239 --> 01:01:46.209
Shut the fuck up.

01:01:46.342 --> 01:01:50.013
<i>Does God let those
who love him die?</i>

01:01:50.147 --> 01:01:52.248
<i>Suffer?</i>

01:01:52.382 --> 01:01:54.650
Bitch!

01:01:54.784 --> 01:01:56.286
Daddy like to rape
little boys.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.255
- What is he talking about?
- I'm sorry.

01:01:59.389 --> 01:02:01.458
- <i>Can I get a "amen"?</i>
- Shut up!

01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:03.393
- <i>Can I get a witness?</i>
- Shut up!

01:02:03.527 --> 01:02:05.162
<i>Can I get somebody here?</i>

01:02:07.264 --> 01:02:08.498
<i>Rise up with me.</i>

01:02:08.632 --> 01:02:10.934
Kill this motherfucker.

01:02:11.067 --> 01:02:13.571
<i>Y'all not paying no
attention to what I'm saying.</i>

01:02:13.703 --> 01:02:16.372
See you on the other side, bitch!

01:02:16.505 --> 01:02:21.578
<i>Black misery, I'm telling y'all.
Black misery loves company.</i>

01:02:22.346 --> 01:02:24.281
Fuck you!

01:02:24.415 --> 01:02:26.617
Take anything you want.

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:30.654
<i>But that misery?
Well, Jesse...</i>

01:02:31.788 --> 01:02:35.992
<i>that misery
is yours to end.</i>

01:02:43.165 --> 01:02:45.268
<i>Jesse. Jesse.</i>

01:02:49.072 --> 01:02:50.407
It's just me.

01:03:05.388 --> 01:03:08.458
Uh, I got something
to tell you.

01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:19.703
I fucking love you.
I love you like a brother, you know.

01:03:22.304 --> 01:03:24.607
You and Nicky
are all I got.

01:03:28.612 --> 01:03:30.714
You're all I fucking got.

01:03:32.016 --> 01:03:33.617
And...

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:41.592
It's over.

01:03:43.326 --> 01:03:44.661
You hear me?

01:03:48.632 --> 01:03:51.335
You won't fucking
see him no more.

01:03:52.302 --> 01:03:53.871
It's done.

01:04:04.114 --> 01:04:09.319
Anyway, now we can fucking live a
new life and get the fuck outta here.

01:04:09.451 --> 01:04:11.721
You can come stay with me.

01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:15.090
Hope you could, uh...

01:04:15.958 --> 01:04:18.428
Hope you could
think about that, you know.

01:04:21.732 --> 01:04:23.067
Uh...

01:04:29.505 --> 01:04:31.574
You got family, man.

01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:35.512
Just, uh...

01:04:38.014 --> 01:04:39.683
come over later.

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:42.652
I'm here.

01:05:45.081 --> 01:05:47.216
<i>Because I don't speak,</i>

01:05:47.350 --> 01:05:50.886
<i>people think that
I don't got a voice inside.</i>

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.990
<i>But no, it's there,
and it can get loud.</i>

01:05:54.123 --> 01:05:55.391
Are you ready?

01:05:55.525 --> 01:05:59.262
- Let's fly.
- <i>Times when it's the loudest, like now,</i>

01:05:59.395 --> 01:06:01.565
<i>is when everything is calm.</i>

01:06:01.697 --> 01:06:03.398
Build up the capes!

01:06:03.532 --> 01:06:06.268
- <i>Because somehow that voice inside knows...</i>
- One... two... three!

01:06:06.402 --> 01:06:09.706
- Jump! Let's go!
- <i>...there's a storm coming.</i>

01:07:03.159 --> 01:07:06.328
Nicky, look at me.
Nicky, look at me!

01:07:06.462 --> 01:07:08.464
Look at me.
What did you do?

01:07:08.598 --> 01:07:10.900
Nicky, what did you do?

01:07:11.034 --> 01:07:14.905
Nicky, look at me.
Look at me!

01:07:15.672 --> 01:07:18.574
Look at me. Baby.

01:07:19.641 --> 01:07:21.611
What did you do?

01:07:23.078 --> 01:07:25.047
What are you fucking looking at?

01:07:25.915 --> 01:07:28.719
What are you fucking looking at?

01:07:53.576 --> 01:07:55.811
Fuck, man.
What happened?

01:08:00.016 --> 01:08:01.084
My phone.

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:05.022
<i>My phone was in the car.</i>

01:08:05.721 --> 01:08:07.323
<i>Fuck.</i>

01:08:11.627 --> 01:08:13.297
Forget it.

01:08:15.732 --> 01:08:19.069
Hey, um...

01:08:19.201 --> 01:08:21.270
you tell Jesse?

01:08:30.645 --> 01:08:32.816
One other thing.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.853
I need you to promise me,
you and Jesse,

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:41.590
<i>that you're gonna take care
of my little one.</i>

01:08:41.725 --> 01:08:43.859
What are you saying, man?

01:08:43.993 --> 01:08:46.629
No, no, no.
I need you to do that.

01:08:47.496 --> 01:08:49.198
You understand me?

01:08:55.938 --> 01:08:57.707
I fucking promise.

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:05.680
Right.

01:09:26.502 --> 01:09:28.839
Wonder where
that train is going.

01:09:32.575 --> 01:09:34.144
Far from here.

01:09:39.781 --> 01:09:41.951
You ever been
on a train, Jesse?

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:52.862
We going
on a fucking train.

01:10:01.771 --> 01:10:03.773
We gotta get him
out of there.

01:10:06.142 --> 01:10:07.711
Gotta fucking
handle this shit.

01:10:07.843 --> 01:10:13.149
Man, I... I feel stuck.
Hate fucking feeling stuck.

01:10:20.121 --> 01:10:21.924
I'm not leaving without him.

01:10:37.874 --> 01:10:39.810
Hell yeah.

01:10:42.712 --> 01:10:44.313
My nigga.

01:10:46.650 --> 01:10:48.685
I love you, Jesse.

01:10:48.817 --> 01:10:52.888
<i>See, baby boy,
you gotta be more like the Earth.</i>

01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:59.328
You spin silently,
but shake real loud.

01:11:02.498 --> 01:11:05.968
<i>Or you can be more like
the insects, you know,</i>

01:11:06.102 --> 01:11:10.107
<i>'cause they carry
their own weight.</i>

01:11:14.643 --> 01:11:17.981
Or you could be
like the tree

01:11:18.114 --> 01:11:22.052
and just dig your roots
all deep inside the earth.

01:11:24.553 --> 01:11:26.688
<i>Or you could be like time.</i>

01:11:27.656 --> 01:11:30.893
<i>See, 'cause time,
time waits for nobody.</i>

01:11:31.026 --> 01:11:33.896
Hey, bro! I like your hat!

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:38.901
- You got him.
- That's what you get!

01:12:15.038 --> 01:12:18.340
You gotta be
more like the moon, son.

01:12:20.343 --> 01:12:22.579
You gotta know
when to hide.

01:12:25.181 --> 01:12:28.417
But now you can be
like the sun.

01:12:28.551 --> 01:12:31.053
Shine, baby.

01:12:33.289 --> 01:12:36.560
Goodbye, my brother, you...

01:12:38.093 --> 01:12:41.130
We'll see you in...
in Venus.

01:13:25.008 --> 01:13:27.544
Mama, what's wrong?

01:13:33.449 --> 01:13:35.851
No, no!

01:13:35.985 --> 01:13:38.922
No, no, no.

01:13:39.054 --> 01:13:42.491
No, Jesse, no.

01:13:43.526 --> 01:13:46.262
No, no, no!

01:13:46.396 --> 01:13:49.699
No, no, no!

01:13:49.833 --> 01:13:51.368
Jesse!

01:13:53.602 --> 01:13:56.072
Jesse.

01:13:58.606 --> 01:13:59.708
I'm...

01:14:00.243 --> 01:14:03.280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:29.605
Hey, I'ma roll with you.

01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.209
I'm driving.

01:15:00.703 --> 01:15:03.706
<i>Sometimes you wish you
had the right thing to say.</i>

01:15:10.012 --> 01:15:13.416
<i>Or, in my case, anything.</i>

01:15:19.655 --> 01:15:22.192
Something nice
about that water, huh?

01:15:26.596 --> 01:15:30.133
Life's a lot
like them waves, Jesse.

01:15:32.968 --> 01:15:35.105
Sometimes we feeling like...

01:15:37.139 --> 01:15:40.509
feeling like there ain't
no rhyme or reason to this shit.

01:15:42.378 --> 01:15:45.148
Can't nothing be further
from the truth.

01:15:46.949 --> 01:15:49.219
What happened to Calvin, man,

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.353
that shit ain't gonna
go unanswered,

01:15:52.487 --> 01:15:55.325
but you better believe it
ain't gonna be answered by you.

01:16:00.262 --> 01:16:04.266
Hey, look, man.
Life got a way.

01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:08.438
It do.
It got a way of just...

01:16:09.938 --> 01:16:11.540
figuring that shit out.

01:16:24.553 --> 01:16:26.288
I know why you're here.

01:16:30.192 --> 01:16:32.994
You take all the time
in the world.

01:16:33.129 --> 01:16:35.465
I'll be right here
when you get ready.

01:18:14.396 --> 01:18:16.565
I love you. Don't move.

01:18:27.308 --> 01:18:28.844
Hey, little brother.

01:18:38.687 --> 01:18:41.958
You ever heard
of a thing called life?

01:18:43.426 --> 01:18:46.829
<i>L-I-F-E.</i>

01:18:46.963 --> 01:18:50.432
The "L" means life,
the "E" means everlasting,

01:18:50.566 --> 01:18:53.069
but there's two letters
in the middle.

01:18:53.201 --> 01:18:57.739
"If."
If you watch yourself.

01:18:59.307 --> 01:19:00.676
Pick one...

01:19:01.643 --> 01:19:03.544
and your wish
will come true.

01:19:04.213 --> 01:19:06.449
One might take you to Venus.

01:19:09.151 --> 01:19:11.254
That's my favorite.

01:19:15.456 --> 01:19:17.392
Keep living, brother.

01:19:18.694 --> 01:19:20.161
What's this?

01:19:20.295 --> 01:19:21.664
Shiny rock.

01:19:21.798 --> 01:19:24.367
Shiny rock? Okay.

01:19:24.499 --> 01:19:27.101
Come on.
Let's go dry our clothes.

01:19:27.236 --> 01:19:29.338
All right.
Drying clothes time.

01:19:29.471 --> 01:19:31.741
Drying clothes time.

01:20:02.504 --> 01:20:05.007
<i>Today I'm gonna pray.</i>

01:20:05.141 --> 01:20:07.977
<i>I'm gonna pray that
God is looking out for me.</i>

01:20:09.411 --> 01:20:11.013
<i>'Cause today...</i>

01:20:12.347 --> 01:20:14.016
<i>things will be different.</i>

01:24:07.024 --> 01:24:12.024
