10:06.960 --> 10:12.280
No. No, erm, I suggested you
call down to the ultrasound room

10:12.440 --> 10:13.720
in one of the messages.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.240
She's useless.
Absolutely useless.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.576
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.480
- Not to worry.
- No, no worries.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.800
Erm, but perhaps you could
come down this afternoon.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.680
Ah. Sorry, but we've...

10:23.840 --> 10:26.200
We're expecting someone
to pass away this afternoon.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.240
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yes, I mean...

10:29.400 --> 10:31.560
I really need to be
here, you know?

10:31.720 --> 10:35.880
I like to hold their hands. You
know, it's just something I like to do.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.640
Well, why don't you come
in your lunch break, then?

10:38.800 --> 10:41.680
I don't get a lunch break. Sorry,
but I have to crack on with paperwork

10:41.840 --> 10:43.800
during the lunch hour.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.200
So... look, it's, um...

10:46.360 --> 10:49.480
It's entirely up to you, but, erm,
it really is in your best interest

10:49.640 --> 10:52.240
to come down and...
And complete the scan.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.960
I'll try.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.536
All right. All right, why don't you come
down whenever you get a moment?

10:58.560 --> 10:59.920
This is mrs garvey.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.280
[Sighs]

11:33.320 --> 11:35.720
- Hey, vij.
- Hey. How's it going?

11:35.880 --> 11:37.560
- Yeah, it's great. It's great.
- Good.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.080
- Hey, do you want a cigarette?
- No, thanks.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.320
-Oh, sorry, I forgot. You don't, do you?
-No, I don't.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.760
You know what? I will.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.280
Yeah? Yeah.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.616
Hilary loftus: "Skill
mixing is an important part

11:57.640 --> 11:59.960
"of workforce

12:00.120 --> 12:02.600
"and it's crucial

12:02.760 --> 12:07.360
"if cost-effective and appropriate

12:08.240 --> 12:09.240
What are you doing?

12:09.320 --> 12:10.960
I'm on my lunch break, so...

12:11.120 --> 12:12.480
What are you doing smoking?

12:12.640 --> 12:15.000
Oh, for god's... Leave
me alone, hils, please.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.240
What about the baby?

12:16.400 --> 12:18.520
- Yeah...
- You're pregnant?

12:18.680 --> 12:20.200
What's it got to do with you?

12:20.360 --> 12:22.240
Well, it might have
a lot to do with me!

12:22.400 --> 12:24.136
- Is this true?
- Oh, come on. Look, stop it.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.720
This is ridiculous. Please.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.976
- I thought you were a back-doors man.
- Come on, vij...

12:28.000 --> 12:31.200
- Haven't you heard of seepage?
- Come on! Vijay! Vijay...

12:31.360 --> 12:33.280
Leave me alone, you slaggy ton!

12:33.440 --> 12:36.120
Stop it! Stop it! Just stop it!

12:36.280 --> 12:40.040
I haven't got a bloody baby! I
lost it. I lost the baby, all right?

12:44.120 --> 12:45.760
You've lost the baby?

12:58.000 --> 13:01.520
Right, now, who wants to be a
nurse like me when they grow up?

13:01.680 --> 13:03.080
- Not me.
- Not me.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.480
- Not you?
- No.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.440
- Do you want to?
- Yeah!

13:06.600 --> 13:08.976
You can wear a nice dress like
this. That'd look nice, wouldn't it?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.840
Ooh, yeah! [Laughing]

13:11.000 --> 13:13.640
You are all allowed to wear
trousers if you're a male nurse.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.000
[Speaking German]

13:17.840 --> 13:19.840
You want to be a swot?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.376
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt. We
have to go down to the art room...

13:22.400 --> 13:25.120
- Oh, ok, guys.
- And start making our works, so come with me, team.

13:25.280 --> 13:27.480
-Kids: Ohhh!
-No, you'll have fun. You'll have a laugh.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.160
- No probs. Bye!
- All: Bye!

13:29.320 --> 13:30.840
Bye, see you soon.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.440
Kid: She's really funny.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.640
Here you go, pauline.
How are you feeling?

13:40.800 --> 13:42.560
Oh, all right. Good.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.120
Oh, I didn't order Moroccan
spicy giant couscous.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.480
I ordered the linguine.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.600
Ok, let me see what I can do.

13:50.760 --> 13:53.280
-Oh, would you, dear? It might repeat on me.
-Well, quite.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.840
Have we got any linguines left?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.880
Do you know what? Annapurna
cleared me right out of linguine.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.640
I didn't think she'd notice!

14:02.800 --> 14:05.800
Ok, well, I'll see what
we've got in a minute, then.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.720
Erm... hello!

14:07.880 --> 14:09.200
Excuse me, dear?

14:09.360 --> 14:12.880
Carol here ordered
szechuan-style salmon

14:13.040 --> 14:16.800
and she's got butternut squash
with honey cinnamon butter instead.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.360
- A piece of bread and butter'd do me fine.
- So sorry.

14:19.520 --> 14:23.120
- Kim: All right, I'll make you a piece of toast, ok?
- Thanks. Thanks, yeah.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.640
- What did you order, babe?
- Woman: I don't remember.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.160
Oh, she ordered wild
mushroom tortellini.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.880
Oh, she's sharp
as a tack, that one.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.480
I know. And dr Moore
thinks she's got dementia.

14:37.640 --> 14:42.960
Skill mixing is an important part of
workforce planning within the nhs

14:43.120 --> 14:47.320
and crucial if cost-effective
and appropriate care

14:47.480 --> 14:50.320
is to be delivered
to all patients.

14:50.480 --> 14:56.480
The nursing workforce, registered
nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants,

14:57.560 --> 14:59.200
hca,

15:01.880 --> 15:05.800
represent the largest
single staff group,

15:05.960 --> 15:10.440
and their salaries constitute
the largest annual budget.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.120
The information I have gathered,

15:13.280 --> 15:19.080
I have compared to established budgets to
determine whether adjustments are required

15:19.240 --> 15:26.240
and whether any nursing posts
could be converted into hca posts.

15:29.640 --> 15:34.240
The role of the c-grade hcas
is currently being developed

15:34.400 --> 15:37.200
to enable them to
increase responsibility,

15:37.360 --> 15:39.000
but accountability

15:39.160 --> 15:43.120
for the patient care will
remain the responsibility

15:43.280 --> 15:45.120
of the registered nurse.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.280
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.640
- I've come to see our auntie, mrs Osbourne.
- Grace Osbourne.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.520
Ok. Come with me. She's
just down here in the side ward.

15:57.680 --> 15:58.960
Can I get you a cup of tea?

15:59.120 --> 16:01.520
No, I'm all right, thank
you. Thank you very much.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.280
Please go in.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.760
Thank you.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.000
I mean, I don't care
whether they're hcas

16:33.160 --> 16:36.480
or proper nurses as long as they
support the clinical decision making.

16:36.640 --> 16:39.600
Do you, erm, do you want
to go in convoy back to mine?

16:39.760 --> 16:41.960
Oh, shouldn't I just pop
home and grab my cossie first?

16:42.640 --> 16:43.880
Nah.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.600
- Oh, Tom!
- Pippa!

16:57.760 --> 17:00.480
- Sorry, I was miles away.
- Wow, you look sensational.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.640
- Oh, thank you.
- Yes, well, time for a change.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.600
Listen, fantastic news about
your vag-at. Congratulations.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.320
Oh well yes, thank you Tom.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.216
It's going to be very, very
good for the hospital, so...

17:09.240 --> 17:11.296
Not just the hospital. It won't do
your reputation any harm, either.

17:11.320 --> 17:14.920
No, that is true. Yes. Indeed. Er,
yes, Tom, I was going to ask you,

17:15.080 --> 17:18.480
would you be interested in
exploring a private clinic with me?

17:18.640 --> 17:22.360
I think opening up the amenorrheic
market is going to be very lucrative.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.160
Absolutely. I think
that is a great idea.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.600
Mmm. Good.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.400
Well, listen, I mean,
why don't we have dinner,

17:29.560 --> 17:31.560
and, you know, we
can talk about it?

17:31.720 --> 17:34.360
When would be a good time?

17:34.520 --> 17:38.320
Tom... if we are going to work
together, I should let you know...

17:38.480 --> 17:39.800
I don't know if you're aware,

17:39.960 --> 17:43.000
but you often touch people,

17:43.160 --> 17:45.720
women, in a way that
can be misleading.

17:45.880 --> 17:49.360
Busted. I do, er,
I do like a cougar.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.920
Well, I've always been
very fond of ferrets, Tom,

17:52.080 --> 17:54.880
but I wouldn't want
one down my trousers.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.480
- Come in, sister flixter.
- Thank you.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.720
Come and sit down.
Really glad you're here.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.720
Thank you.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.720
So, please, make
yourself comfortable.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.720
So, erm, what happened?

18:21.960 --> 18:23.520
Oh, I had a miscarriage.

18:23.680 --> 18:28.440
Ok. Erm, so, before, when
you said that you hadn't,

18:28.600 --> 18:31.080
had you actually
had some bleeding?

18:31.240 --> 18:32.600
Yes, I had.

18:32.760 --> 18:36.760
Ok. Well, that would explain
what I saw in the scan.

18:36.920 --> 18:41.440
Er, first of all, I should say
that, erm, I could see a baby

18:42.400 --> 18:44.080
with a heartbeat,

18:44.240 --> 18:48.040
which means that it
was a twin pregnancy,

18:48.200 --> 18:51.400
one baby that was
alive and growing

18:52.240 --> 18:55.040
and one that had died.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.320
Are you saying that there is...

18:59.240 --> 19:01.480
Are you saying that there's...

19:01.640 --> 19:04.280
Might have... There's
another baby there?

19:04.440 --> 19:06.840
Yes, that's right. Erm...

19:07.000 --> 19:08.760
I don't understand, sorry.

19:08.920 --> 19:12.400
- Well, it means that you could still be pregnant.
- Mmm.

19:12.560 --> 19:16.120
Erm, and I'm going to
take a scan now to check.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.640
And you'll stay this time?

19:18.800 --> 19:20.480
- Ok.
- Yes.

19:20.640 --> 19:24.400
Ok, well, if you'd like to
show me your tummy again...

19:29.160 --> 19:32.080
So, if you want to check that in the
formulary, please, Josh, well done.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.720
And we'll get on with
organising that medication.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.280
Excuse me, dr Moore, is
that medication for mrs salt?

19:38.440 --> 19:41.920
- I beg your pardon?
- Is that medication for mrs pauline salt?

19:42.080 --> 19:43.280
Sorry, your point being...

19:43.440 --> 19:45.480
Well, I mean, she seems
perfectly lucid to me.

19:45.640 --> 19:48.120
The woman is babbling
about owls, nurse.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.936
I know you're training to be a doctor,
but you've got a long way to go yet.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.840
Well, actually, I'm not any
more, for your information.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh. Well, I must say,
that doesn't surprise me.

19:56.160 --> 20:00.560
Yes, medical training is a lot of
hard work, as Josh will tell you.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.400
Well, it's not really the work.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.040
Well, it is the work,
because, if I do it,

20:05.200 --> 20:08.160
I won't have time for anything else.
I won't have any time for the kids,

20:08.320 --> 20:11.040
I won't have time to watch
telly with Dave on Friday nights.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.440
In fact, I won't
have any fun at all.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.496
Yes, well, not to say that one doesn't have to
have the right attributes in the first place,

20:16.520 --> 20:18.480
but as professor
portnoy-noor always says,

20:18.640 --> 20:21.160
it's the abcs that make the
best doctors, academicians,

20:21.320 --> 20:23.920
brainboxes, competitors. So...

20:24.080 --> 20:27.200
And as Ian dury says...
[Softly] Arseholes, bastards...

20:27.360 --> 20:29.120
Sorry, did you say something?

20:29.280 --> 20:30.960
Yes, I did, actually.

20:31.120 --> 20:32.776
Do I need to discuss this breach
with your line manager, nurse?

20:32.800 --> 20:35.240
Well, seeing as I don't
actually need a reference

20:35.400 --> 20:37.080
for being a doctor any more

20:37.240 --> 20:39.680
and I'm about to be skills-mixed
out to a healthcare assistant,

20:39.760 --> 20:41.960
it doesn't really
apply, does it?

20:43.040 --> 20:44.280
Oh, dear!

20:53.160 --> 20:54.680
Tatty: Ok...

20:57.240 --> 20:58.520
[Groans]

20:58.680 --> 21:00.000
All right?

21:00.160 --> 21:02.760
There's baby's heartbeat.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.280
[Whimpers]

21:07.920 --> 21:10.200
- So...
- Ok?

21:10.360 --> 21:11.960
Yes. Is that...

21:12.120 --> 21:14.480
Which is... Where's
the heart? I can't see.

21:14.640 --> 21:18.200
That's it beating there. Can
you see? The head's here.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.120
Mmm. Yeah.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.520
Arms and legs
are kicking nicely.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.120
- Ok?
- Hello!

21:30.680 --> 21:31.680
Ok...

21:37.240 --> 21:41.760
Excuse me? Last I heard, you
didn't work at this hospital any more.

21:41.920 --> 21:45.080
I was guest of the chief
executive up until 14 minutes ago,

21:45.240 --> 21:48.600
when I feeded in my findings
and put in my final invoice.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.360
So why are you still here, then?

21:50.520 --> 21:52.880
Somebody's nicked my iPad.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.920
If you do see it, it's got my
name and number on the back.

21:56.080 --> 21:59.760
I need to put forward my bid
for the cerium cardiac contract.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.760
They're moving into
medical provisions.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.840
They need cost analysis! Oh,
excuse me, I've got bums to wipe.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.720
- Do you know where the keys are for this?
- No!

22:13.040 --> 22:15.160
Since we're celebrating,
Josh, would you like to share

22:15.240 --> 22:16.640
a slice of fruit cake?

22:18.200 --> 22:19.720
- Philip?
- Philippa!

22:21.400 --> 22:23.960
Erm, Josh, this is,
erm, my husband...

22:24.120 --> 22:26.320
My ex-husband, Philip Moore.

22:26.480 --> 22:29.640
Erm, Philip, this is
Joshua, Mr... Dr mbaka...

22:29.800 --> 22:32.400
- My... research assistant.
- Very nice to meet you.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.160
Pippa, you look so different.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.160
What on earth are
you doing here?
