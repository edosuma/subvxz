12:52.575 --> 12:54.242
and we bring him back when he's ready.

13:11.728 --> 13:13.687
- You couldn't close?
- No?

13:14.710 --> 13:16.867
The amount of surgery he needs
to fix everything

13:16.878 --> 13:19.959
would be too much for a body
to handle in one go.

13:19.969 --> 13:21.795
How long until you can go back in?

13:21.805 --> 13:23.863
It's a long range.

13:23.873 --> 13:25.940
Could be hours, could be days.

13:27.362 --> 13:29.662
This is not the outcome we wanted.

13:44.728 --> 13:47.781
We don't need to do this. Please.
You need to rest.

13:48.377 --> 13:51.223
Can't. Too hard to breathe. (EXHALES)

13:51.234 --> 13:54.802
If I fall asleep...
I'm afraid I won't wake up.

13:56.339 --> 13:57.964
Sydney, Evan.

13:57.974 --> 13:59.366
This is Dr. Hawkins.

13:59.376 --> 14:01.738
We're gonna take a closer look at you.

14:01.749 --> 14:04.336
- Hello.
- Double mono patients.

14:04.354 --> 14:06.469
Sydney is stable, but Evan is hypoxic.

14:06.480 --> 14:09.309
Chest X-ray was just done, and
we're waiting on the results.

14:09.319 --> 14:10.977
But I think we need to up the O2.

14:10.987 --> 14:14.536
Look, please help him.
He's getting much worse.

14:15.258 --> 14:17.525
(WHEEZING)

14:19.596 --> 14:21.654
Yeah, we should crank up the O2.

14:21.664 --> 14:24.689
And let's order a breathing treatment.

14:25.869 --> 14:27.648
I like the dedication.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.036
from... Atlanta to Nashville.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.508
So he can go home on the weekends.

14:41.518 --> 14:43.676
That's where we're both from.

14:43.686 --> 14:46.220
(COUGHING)

14:48.027 --> 14:50.745
Why is Evan so much worse
when we both have mono?

14:50.756 --> 14:52.815
The truth is, it's hard to know.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.888
Each person reacts differently
to a virus.

14:54.898 --> 14:56.564
But he's gonna be okay, right?

14:56.575 --> 15:00.176
Um, just one second...

15:02.699 --> 15:05.500
(QUIETLY): His X-ray's back.
This is really bad.

15:08.778 --> 15:10.737
All right, let's get him to the ICU.

15:10.747 --> 15:12.213
Okay.

15:13.883 --> 15:15.909
Let's start him on ceftriaxone
and azithromycin.

15:15.919 --> 15:18.445
Call respiratory. Put him on
a BiPap when we get to the unit.

15:18.455 --> 15:20.580
And I need another full set
of labs with a blood gas.

15:20.590 --> 15:22.549
Yes, Doctor.

15:22.559 --> 15:25.318
ICU? That's bad, isn't it?

15:25.328 --> 15:27.587
Well, his mono's caused him
to develop pneumonia.

15:27.597 --> 15:29.589
- Pneumonia?
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

15:29.599 --> 15:31.424
Listen, let's just try to stay calm

15:31.434 --> 15:33.493
so we can be there for Evan. Okay?

15:33.503 --> 15:35.929
Okay. Calm.

15:35.939 --> 15:39.799
Not one of my best traits,
but I can do it for him.

15:39.847 --> 15:42.348
You got this. Here, come with me.

please call Recovery.

15:48.742 --> 15:50.816
- Lactate levels?
- Coming down.

15:50.827 --> 15:53.366
- Most recent hematocrit?
- 24% stable.

15:53.377 --> 15:56.188
- But there was a lot of trauma.
- Can we take him back to surgery now?

15:56.199 --> 15:58.524
He needs time for
his hemodynamics to stabilize.

15:58.535 --> 16:00.815
MINA: His IVC is leaking. We
need to repair it quickly.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.523
- Our first pass was crude.
- We bring him back in now,

16:03.533 --> 16:05.758
- I don't think he makes it.
- We need to decide. Soon.

16:05.768 --> 16:07.702
I know, Mina.

16:10.738 --> 16:12.455
How's he doing?

16:14.939 --> 16:17.774
If we dialed back his sedatives, do
you think he'd be able to speak?

16:17.785 --> 16:19.472
That's inappropriate, Pravesh.

16:19.482 --> 16:21.251
It wouldn't hurt him.
And it might even...

16:21.262 --> 16:23.443
You are too close to this case.

16:23.453 --> 16:25.152
And you're not?

16:29.692 --> 16:32.693
Go back to the ER, Pravesh.

16:34.026 --> 16:35.725
I will keep you updated.

16:46.142 --> 16:47.200
Book an OR.

16:47.210 --> 16:49.068
We'll give him a half hour,

16:49.078 --> 16:52.013
we'll go back into surgery,
and we'll finish the job.

He has crackles throughout his lungs.

17:15.980 --> 17:17.396
BiPap isn't enough.

17:17.406 --> 17:19.866
- He needs a vent.
- Please, what does that mean?

17:19.876 --> 17:21.781
He can't breathe on his own
anymore, so the vent

17:21.792 --> 17:24.957
- will breathe for him.
- Evan, I'm here. I won't leave you.

17:24.968 --> 17:27.707
- We need to intubate now.
- I'm already on it. I paged RT.

You need to wait outside.

17:28.851 --> 17:30.076

20:23.054 --> 20:25.513
tracks down a man like me
with information like this,

20:25.523 --> 20:27.816
