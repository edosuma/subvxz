THE DRAGON: In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.256 --> 00:10.136
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.219 --> 00:13.014
His name, Merlin.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.809
(ALICE HUMMING)

00:52.595 --> 00:56.098
(CASTING SPELL)

01:06.651 --> 01:07.902
(SNARLING)

01:18.579 --> 01:21.040
(SOFTLY) Calm yourself, my pretty.

01:24.627 --> 01:26.295
We're home now.

02:01.247 --> 02:04.709
Gaius, there have been disturbing
rumors from outlying villages.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.335
-Sire?
-Someone,

02:06.419 --> 02:08.920
some kind of physician
is offering treatments.

02:09.005 --> 02:10.339
| fear magic may have been used.

02:11.716 --> 02:13.718
What is it that makes you suspicious?

02:13.801 --> 02:16.887
There are reports of miracle cures.

02:16.971 --> 02:21.392
A boy thrown from a horse,
a farmhand mauled by a boar.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.728
All hopeless cases it seems,

02:24.228 --> 02:26.188
and yet each and every one
has made a full recovery.

02:27.356 --> 02:30.651
It's very hard for me to comment, sire.
I'd have to examine the patients myself.

02:30.735 --> 02:32.111
That won't be necessary,

02:33.154 --> 02:35.740
as a new case
has arisen here in Camelot.

02:36.741 --> 02:38.409
-Who?
-The innkeeper.

02:39.368 --> 02:40.995
He's returned to work.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.621
That's not possible.

02:42.705 --> 02:45.166
The condition was critical,
| saw him only days ago.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.335
So you agree
that magic must be involved.

02:47.418 --> 02:48.586
Well, I couldn't say for sure.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.921
Then go to the tavern and find out.

02:51.589 --> 02:54.216
If sorcery is at work here,
we must act quickly.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.052
Yes, sire. I'll see to it right away.

03:00.723 --> 03:02.600
It's unbelievable.

03:02.683 --> 03:06.062
Uther has no problem turning to magic
if his family are threatened.

03:06.145 --> 03:08.356
Keep your voice down, Merlin.

03:08.439 --> 03:11.984
-Oh, he is such a hypocrite.
-He's also the king.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.445
So, if you value your head, use it.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.414
EVORIC: Welcome!

03:27.166 --> 03:29.627
Gaius, what a pleasant surprise.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.921
-Evoric.
-What can I get you?

03:32.004 --> 03:34.757
Nothing. I just dropped in
to see how you're doing.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.550
Much improved, as you can see.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.970
Indeed. Remarkable recovery.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.514
All thanks to you, Gaius.

03:41.597 --> 03:43.682
(SCOFFS) I think not.

03:44.642 --> 03:47.353
Evoric, I am, of course,
delighted that you're well again,

03:47.436 --> 03:49.063
but I must ask you,

03:49.647 --> 03:51.816
from whom did you obtain your remedy?

03:52.983 --> 03:54.068
Don't know what you're talking about.

03:54.151 --> 03:57.571
Now, you mustn't be afraid.
I'm not the king, after all.

03:59.657 --> 04:01.992
My wife, she was desperate.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.078
| was slipping away.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.247
Go on.

04:06.330 --> 04:09.875
She met a woman, a healer,
in the lower town

04:09.959 --> 04:11.502
and she gave her a cure.

04:13.504 --> 04:14.839
Can I see it?

04:32.690 --> 04:34.358
How interesting.

04:35.860 --> 04:38.696
-Am I in some kind of trouble?
-No, not at all.

04:39.447 --> 04:40.865
You've been most helpful.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.959
What was the nature of this treatment?

04:52.835 --> 04:55.337
-Hogwart and fenugreek.
-Excuse me?

04:55.880 --> 04:57.465
Herbs, sire.

04:57.548 --> 05:00.468
Whoever prescribed them
was highly skilled.

05:00.551 --> 05:03.721
Their grasp of the five principles
of herbal conjoinment was...

05:03.971 --> 05:06.223
What about the boy and the laborer?

05:06.307 --> 05:09.268
Surely they were beyond the help
of such remedies?

05:09.643 --> 05:12.062
Not necessarily, sire.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.482
A physician's art
can achieve great things.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.025
But not miracles.

05:16.108 --> 05:19.653
The innkeeper was fatally ill,
you said so yourself.

05:19.737 --> 05:22.615
Yes, that was indeed my diagnosis.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.950
But my knowledge isn't perfect.

05:25.034 --> 05:28.204
There are many branches of my craft
are yet mysteries to me.

05:28.579 --> 05:32.166
| could not heal the innkeeper.
Someone else could.

05:36.712 --> 05:39.632
Are you absolutely satisfied
that no magic was involved?

05:41.592 --> 05:43.052
Entirely, sire.

05:45.596 --> 05:48.224
Thank you, Gaius.
You've set my mind at rest.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.519
My lord.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.988
| think it's great what you did,

06:04.740 --> 06:06.200
protecting the innkeeper like that.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.618
What do you mean?

06:09.078 --> 06:10.454
He was a sick man.

06:11.205 --> 06:14.875
It was a matter of life and death.
Magic was his only hope.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.502
But he didn't use magic.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.756
The potion was enchanted,
| saw it with my own eyes.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.091
We both did.

06:22.383 --> 06:25.219
What you saw, Merlin,
was a release of gaseous pressure.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.973
Entirely normal in a preparation
of that kind.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.227
-But what about the totem?
-What totem?

06:33.310 --> 06:37.314
The totem in the innkeeper's doorway
bore the marks of the Old Religion.

06:37.982 --> 06:39.191
Nonsense.

06:41.110 --> 06:44.989
You're obviously tired, Merlin.
| recommend you get some sleep.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.157
Well, can...

06:55.916 --> 06:57.668
-(DOOR CLANKING)
-(MERLIN GASPS)

07:33.495 --> 07:34.663
Gaius?

07:36.206 --> 07:37.374
Alice.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.043
Oh.

07:46.634 --> 07:47.885
(GAIUS SIGHS)

07:56.018 --> 07:57.227
(APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS)

08:10.407 --> 08:13.410
-How did you know I was in Camelot?
-I recognized your work.

08:13.744 --> 08:16.413
Your healing magic
was always equal to none.

08:17.081 --> 08:20.042
Oh, Gaius,
you've lost none of your charm.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.462
And you've lost none of your skill.
You saved the innkeeper's life.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.757
| did what I could, as I know you did.

08:28.467 --> 08:31.637
But my humble potion
was not enough, it seems.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.597
Look at you...

08:34.431 --> 08:36.975
Always so solemn, so serious.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.020
And you always teasing me.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.400
I've missed you.

08:45.526 --> 08:46.777
And I you.

08:48.445 --> 08:52.241
Twenty years and here we are
back in Camelot together again.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.285
It almost seems as though
nothing has changed.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.912
And some things never will.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.125
-Uther.
-It's not safe for you here.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.753
He suspects that magic is at work
in Camelot.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.213
But he doesn't know for sure.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.049
Not yet. But if you stay,
he will find you.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.928
But, Gaius, healing is my only gift.

09:14.138 --> 09:17.558
It is my living.
| must buy food, I must pay rent.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.977
But why here?
The dangers are too great.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.314
Because I wanted to see you again.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.407
(ALICE SIGHING)

09:42.291 --> 09:44.793
Dawn is almost upon us.
| must get back.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.421
Oh, you will come back tomorrow?
Please?

09:47.504 --> 09:48.797
Of course.

09:59.433 --> 10:03.520
You have done well.
The physician is vital to our plan.

10:04.146 --> 10:07.357
Please, must we use him this way?

10:07.691 --> 10:10.569
I've told you before, Uther trusts him.

10:10.652 --> 10:13.280
He alone can get us close enough
to the King.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.158
But he will be blamed
for everything that happens.

10:17.701 --> 10:22.206
(SNARLING) And you will not.
How perfect.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.166
But his punishment will be terrible.

(HISSING)

10:26.210 --> 10:30.214
You must put aside your feelings
and do what needs to be done.

(WHIMPERING) Yes.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.753
Did you go out last night?

11:11.088 --> 11:13.966
Yes. I had to get some herbs.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.468
Herbs?

11:17.761 --> 11:22.182
A... A new supplier, just arrived.

11:22.266 --> 11:23.350
Right.

11:27.229 --> 11:29.189
Do your suppliers normally kiss you?

11:31.567 --> 11:34.361
You followed me. How dare you?

11:34.736 --> 11:36.780
Gaius, it was the middle of the night.
| was worried.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.615
| thought you might be in some
sort of trouble.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.076
There's nothing wrong.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.958
What's her name?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.296
Alice.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.132
She's an old friend.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.802
Well... More than a friend,
if truth be told.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.262
What do you mean?

12:02.723 --> 12:04.516
We were once engaged to be married.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.605
When was this?

12:10.772 --> 12:13.525
More years ago than I care to remember.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.616
| had just been made physician
to the King when I met her.

12:20.699 --> 12:24.995
It was like finding a kindred spirit,
we had so much in common.

12:25.746 --> 12:30.334
Our love of science, of healing.
And of magic.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.004
Magic?

12:34.838 --> 12:36.590
| was just a novice,

12:37.674 --> 12:40.928
but Alice's power and ability
was uncanny.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.930
She had the gift.

12:43.013 --> 12:47.643
Soon she had mastered every aspect
of sorcery, healing above all.

12:49.645 --> 12:54.024
It was wonderful to behold, Merlin.
She saved a great many lives.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.194
-It was Alice that cured the innkeeper?
-Indeed.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.530
There was a time when her skills
were famous in Camelot.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.700
So what happened?

13:04.159 --> 13:06.411
Uther declared war on magic.

13:07.079 --> 13:09.998
Overnight her world
was turned upside down.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.667
The Great Purge.

13:12.626 --> 13:17.172
Uther drew up a list
of everyone suspected of using magic.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.550
One by one, they were hunted down
and executed.

13:21.218 --> 13:24.304
As a close friend of the King,
| was permitted to see this list.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.891
Alice's name was on it.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.226
What did you do?

13:29.309 --> 13:31.937
The only thing I could do.
| struck her name off.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.563
Gaius, if you'd been caught...

13:33.647 --> 13:35.399
| know, but it bought her time.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.026
Just enough to get out of Camelot,
to escape.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.195
But you...

13:42.614 --> 13:43.865
You stayed behind.

13:49.204 --> 13:53.625
| was scared. I felt I had no choice.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.003
| thought I'd never see her again.

13:58.255 --> 14:01.758
But now here she is,
after all these years.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.886

14:08.640 --> 14:10.392
You have a kind heart.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.603
-You always did.
-It's the least I could do.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.566
Will you stay? Please say you will.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.152
You're my only appointment
for this morning.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.653
| made sure of that.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.365
-You recognize them?
-Of course.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.117
It's a totem of healing.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.494
Oh, come, Gaius.
Is that the best you can do?

14:29.578 --> 14:31.747
Have you forgotten
all that we learned together?

14:31.830 --> 14:33.165
Let us see.

14:33.749 --> 14:37.961
It's a sorcerer's chime,
to give it its proper name.

14:38.462 --> 14:42.090
Each crystal bears an elemental sign
of the Old Religion.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.801
When enchanted, the crystals resonate,

14:45.761 --> 14:49.890
their music giving succor
to the ailing and the sick.

14:51.308 --> 14:52.601
You've forgotten nothing.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.605

14:57.814 --> 15:00.609
All that we saw, all that we did,

15:00.692 --> 15:03.278
each and every day we spent together.

15:05.614 --> 15:06.990
| remember the day you left.

15:09.451 --> 15:10.660
Let's not dwell on that.

15:12.162 --> 15:15.874
We found each other again.
Isn't that all that matters?

15:45.445 --> 15:48.657
Come on, Merlin! Put your back into it!

15:49.157 --> 15:50.909
Sorry, sire. I'm just a bit...

15:52.786 --> 15:53.870
Pathetic.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.498
You're pretending to be a
battle-hardened warrior,

Sorry, sire.
Just a bit tired, that's all.

16:02.671 --> 16:03.713
Fair enough.

Ah, Merlin...

...I'd like you to meet Alice.

16:21.398 --> 16:25.569
Merlin, it's a pleasure to meet you.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.571
You too.

with us for a while.

16:32.409 --> 16:34.161
-Great!
-That's all right with you?

16:34.244 --> 16:35.871
Of course. I'll make up the spare bed.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.498
So you won't mind if she uses your room?

When you first knew Alice,
what kinds of magic did she practice?

18:12.050 --> 18:13.343
All kinds.

18:13.468 --> 18:16.513
It was a time of experimentation
and learning.

18:16.846 --> 18:17.931
Right.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.518
What about dark magic?

18:23.311 --> 18:26.773
| daresay.
But those days are long gone.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.484
What if they aren't?

18:31.027 --> 18:35.073
Last night there was some kind
of creature in your room.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.241
Creature?

18:36.324 --> 18:37.867
I've never seen anything like it.

18:37.951 --> 18:41.162
It had the body of a lion
and the tail of a scorpion.

18:41.246 --> 18:44.165
Oh, come on, Merlin.
You must've been dreaming.

18:44.249 --> 18:47.627
No, I saw it with my own eyes
and I could feel its power.

18:47.711 --> 18:51.339
It was magic.
Like nothing I've ever felt before.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.384
What utter nonsense.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.887
If you don't believe me, Gaius,
| can prove it.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.056
Come on.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.601
This is it.

19:07.605 --> 19:10.483
Merlin, put that back.
This has gone far enough.

19:15.613 --> 19:19.409
-Oh, it's in there. I know it is.
-Ridiculous.

19:21.244 --> 19:22.412
Gaius, no!

19:25.415 --> 19:27.459
| hope you're satisfied, Merlin.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.431
Morning.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.532
Hemlock.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.121
Nightshade.

20:09.334 --> 20:10.585
Myrrh.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.798
(LAUGHS) Oh, Gaius.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.841
It's just like old times.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.010
We always made a good team, did we not?

20:19.094 --> 20:20.220
Yeah.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.305
| wish Merlin had your skills.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.225
| fear he finds
the physician's craft boring.

20:25.642 --> 20:28.812
Well, never mind, you've got me
to help you now, haven't you?

20:29.562 --> 20:30.647
Indeed I have.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.193
Now, where's the valerian?

20:36.403 --> 20:39.447
Valerian? For an injury, I presume?

20:39.989 --> 20:43.493
Perfectly correct. I prescribe it
to Uther for an old battle wound.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.913
-He takes it daily?
-Of course.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.010
(GEOFFREY CLEARING THROAT)

21:01.845 --> 21:04.055
-Can I help you?
-No.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.855
Yes. I wonder, do you know anything
about this creature?

21:13.148 --> 21:15.525
Ah, now, that is the Manticore.

21:16.484 --> 21:17.777
A Manticore?

21:17.861 --> 21:20.029
(GASPING) Nasty looking beast, isn't it?

21:20.488 --> 21:22.031
Yeah, you can say that again.

21:22.115 --> 21:26.911
| believe it was first referred to
almost a thousand years ago.

21:27.704 --> 21:31.291
The Ancients lived in fear of it,
trembled at its very name.

21:31.374 --> 21:32.459
I've never even heard of it.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.544
Yeah, well, I'm not surprised.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.964
"Cause as far as I'm aware,
the Manticore is a legend,

21:38.047 --> 21:39.966
figment of the imagination.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.760
-Are you sure?
-Oh, yes.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.682
So, um, if you were hoping to see one,

21:47.765 --> 21:49.726
I'm afraid you're going to
be disappointed.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.734
-Now it's ready to go to the King.
-Fascinating.

21:58.568 --> 22:01.988
Gaius, you said you had a rare form
of mountain balm.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.491
| should like to compare it
with my own, if I may.

22:04.574 --> 22:06.242
-Certainly.
-Oh!

22:07.410 --> 22:09.412
Now, where did I put it?

22:11.456 --> 22:14.042
Perhaps with the second order
palliatives?

22:14.125 --> 22:15.543
Of course.

22:25.720 --> 22:26.888
(ALICE GASPING)

22:28.097 --> 22:30.016
I'm so sorry, Gaius.

22:34.938 --> 22:38.942
Don't worry. Merlin will clear it up,
won't you, Merlin?

22:39.192 --> 22:40.818
No, no! I can do it.

What's that? Who's there?

23:25.280 --> 23:28.825
(WHISPERING) No one. You're dreaming.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.955
Now go back to sleep.

(SNORING)

24:18.541 --> 24:20.752
(BELL TOLLING)

24:26.716 --> 24:28.801
Gaius, I need to talk to you
about Alice.

24:29.385 --> 24:30.678
Merlin, this must stop.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.263
There's a reason the box was empty.

24:32.347 --> 24:35.141
It isn't a container, it's a portal,
a gateway for the Manticore.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.768
This must stop now.

24:36.851 --> 24:39.312
No, Alice is up to something,
and whatever it is, it isn't good.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.647
You're wrong, Merlin.

24:40.730 --> 24:43.483
Alice is the kindest and most
compassionate person I've ever known.

24:43.566 --> 24:44.734
No.

24:44.817 --> 24:48.404
You're wrong, you're just blinded
by your feelings for her.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.282
| can see perfectly well, Merlin.

24:51.366 --> 24:54.535
And what I can see is that you cannot
bear for me to be happy.

24:54.619 --> 24:57.246
| cannot begin to guess
why that should be.

24:59.248 --> 25:00.541
But it saddens me.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.378
More than I can say.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.558
Gaius, there you are.

25:17.642 --> 25:19.560
| was beginning to wonder
where you'd got to.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.521
What's wrong?

25:22.438 --> 25:25.817
It's nothing.
A disagreement with Merlin, that's all.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.235
Was it about me?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.446
You mustn't worry.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.573
He's probably a bit jealous, that's all.

25:32.657 --> 25:33.700
Jealous?

25:33.783 --> 25:37.495
Well, it's only to be expected.
The poor lad's had you all to himself.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.956
He's bound to be a bit hostile
for a while.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.666
Very hostile, if truth be told.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.128
Oh, he'll... He'll soon get used to
having me around.

25:46.629 --> 25:47.755
I'm sure you're right.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.632
Listen.

25:50.800 --> 25:54.470
Why don't you sit yourself down
for a while and take a break.

You're meant to bob, Merlin, weave.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.343
You might as well be a barn door.

26:36.471 --> 26:37.847
Yes, sire.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.017
For goodness sake, what is your problem?

26:43.644 --> 26:44.854
Nothing.

26:45.354 --> 26:48.649
Right. Well, either you tell me,
or we go back to the lance and hoops.

26:51.986 --> 26:55.573
Gaius and me, we...
Had a bit of a falling out.

26:59.494 --> 27:02.413
Look, I row with my father all the time.

27:02.497 --> 27:04.165
You should do what I do,

27:04.248 --> 27:07.126
just lie low and wait
till he comes to his senses.

27:07.210 --> 27:08.419
It'll soon blow over.

27:09.170 --> 27:11.464
No, I don't think so, somehow.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.552
-Oh, cheer up, will you?
-(GASPS)

27:18.888 --> 27:21.682
How is punching me in the arm
meant to cheer me up?

27:23.351 --> 27:24.727
It works with the knights.

-Well, they're thick, aren't they?
-I'm a knight.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.025
There you go, then.

27:46.290 --> 27:48.543
You gave me this book, do you remember?

27:49.836 --> 27:52.004
It was on your birthday, wasn't it?

27:52.088 --> 27:55.925
Or was it when I was made
court physician?

27:56.092 --> 28:00.096
Have a look inside.
I'm sure there's an inscription.

28:06.894 --> 28:10.523

to hasty conclusions, sire.

the expert in such matters?

Oh, you don't need to be a physician
to see what's happened.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.570
-Merlin!
-Gaius, he's been poisoned,

31:02.653 --> 31:04.780

-What exactly are you implying?

It was Alice. It had to be.
She's been helping you with the potions.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.206
She's had every opportunity
to corrupt his medicine.

31:14.290 --> 31:16.042
Merlin, you have no proof
of any of this.

31:16.125 --> 31:17.877
How else did he ingest the poison?

31:19.128 --> 31:20.379
There is no other explanation.

31:20.463 --> 31:22.631
-Of course there is.
-Oh, come on, Gaius!

31:22.715 --> 31:24.842
| understand why you're protecting her.
Really, I do.

31:24.925 --> 31:27.428
But in your heart of hearts,
you must know what I'm saying is true.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.722
All I know
is that the King is gravely ill

31:29.805 --> 31:32.141
and that you're place
is by Arthur's side!

31:42.485 --> 31:43.986

It's brought here under armed guard.
No one can interfere with it in any way.

-It's all right, Merlin.

35:22.079 --> 35:23.455

You were only trying
to save me from harm.

35:28.210 --> 35:29.378
Thank you.

35:33.007 --> 35:35.259
But I don't believe Alice wanted this.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.429
| know she didn't.

35:39.888 --> 35:44.560
The poison is from the Manticore,
the creature that was in Alice's room.

35:46.270 --> 35:48.397
We cannot counteract
the Manticore's venom.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.108
-It's too deadly, by far.
-So what can we do?

35:51.483 --> 35:53.402
We can kill the Manticore.

35:54.111 --> 35:56.447
The poison is imbued with its magic.

35:57.323 --> 36:00.326
With the Manticore dead,
it will lose its potency.

36:00.409 --> 36:02.745
-How do I kill it?
-You can't. You don't have the power.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.913
It's a creature of the Old Religion.

36:05.247 --> 36:09.209
But maybe there's another way,
if I can remember.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.091
Here.

36:20.471 --> 36:23.140
The Manticore cannot live
in this world long.

36:23.223 --> 36:26.935
Its life source is a ancient evil
that exists in the spirit world.

36:27.019 --> 36:29.605
-So if we can trap it in this world...
-Exactly.

36:29.980 --> 36:33.942
If we were to summon the creature
and you kept it at bay long enough,

36:34.026 --> 36:36.695
perhaps I could break the box.

36:36.779 --> 36:37.946
The gateway.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.740
If the gateway is destroyed,

36:39.823 --> 36:42.534
then the creature's connection
with its life source

36:42.618 --> 36:43.827
would be destroyed with it.

36:43.911 --> 36:47.414
-And the Manticore will die?
- I believe so.

36:47.790 --> 36:50.667
Gaius, the box is enchanted.
It would need magic to destroy it.

36:50.793 --> 36:52.628
| am aware of that.

36:53.462 --> 36:56.757
Do you think you can?
Command such magic?

36:58.884 --> 37:00.761
There was a time when I could.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.557
Let us hope I haven't forgotten.

37:17.194 --> 37:18.404
Are you ready?

37:20.489 --> 37:22.116
What if this doesn't work?

37:24.368 --> 37:27.996
Then we're going to have a very angry
Manticore on our hands.

37:33.836 --> 37:35.170
(LID CREAKING)

37:41.844 --> 37:43.929
(CASTING SPELL)

37:54.440 --> 37:56.108
(ROARING)

37:57.025 --> 37:58.277
(MERLIN GRUNTING)

38:07.828 --> 38:08.912
Gaius!

38:09.538 --> 38:12.207
(CASTING SPELL)

38:21.383 --> 38:23.218
-Gaius!
-(MANTICORE SNARLING)

38:25.053 --> 38:26.930
Gaius, it's now or never!

38:27.014 --> 38:30.684
(CASTING SPELL)

38:33.187 --> 38:34.354
(EXPLODING)

38:36.857 --> 38:38.817
-(MANTICORE ROARING)
-Gaius!

38:44.698 --> 38:45.949
(PANTING)

38:53.582 --> 38:55.584
Not too bad for a has-been.

38:55.918 --> 38:57.920
(SIGHING) Not too bad yourself.

38:58.879 --> 39:01.089
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

39:04.968 --> 39:06.178
Whoo!

39:07.930 --> 39:11.475
| am fortunate, indeed,
that you found an antidote, Gaius.

39:11.558 --> 39:14.853
It will take time, my lord,
but you will make a full recovery.

39:15.771 --> 39:17.022
What of the woman?

39:17.105 --> 39:20.192
We have her in the cells, sire.
She awaits your judgment.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.736
She won't have to wait long.
She's sentenced to death.

39:22.903 --> 39:24.780
We'll execute her in the morning.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.783
Yes, Father.

39:28.075 --> 39:30.118
-Sire, if I may...
-Yes, Gaius.

39:30.827 --> 39:34.706
It seems this woman was in the thrall
of some kind of creature.

39:35.290 --> 39:38.585
Perhaps, in the light of that,
her sentence might be...

39:38.669 --> 39:40.546
She practiced magic, Gaius.

39:40.629 --> 39:43.131
There are no circumstances
under which that is acceptable.

39:44.508 --> 39:46.260
Her judgment stands.

40:01.650 --> 40:04.111
I'm sorry, Alice.
There was nothing I could do.

40:04.194 --> 40:05.320
Don't.

40:06.780 --> 40:10.576
| knew what my sentence would be.
Uther will never change.

40:11.785 --> 40:12.869
No.

40:14.162 --> 40:16.123
| hoped that I could learn from it.

40:16.206 --> 40:19.835
That... That I could harness
its magic for the good, for healing,

40:21.128 --> 40:22.588
but it was too strong for me.

40:23.839 --> 40:25.674
At least you are rid of it now.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.051
Yes.

40:30.012 --> 40:32.973
And it's far better to die free
than to live as a slave.

40:33.890 --> 40:35.851
| can only hope that's true.

40:37.352 --> 40:38.520
Gaius...

40:40.772 --> 40:43.567
Before I go,
| want you to know something.

40:43.650 --> 40:45.652
| never forgot you.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.447
Since we parted all those years ago,

40:49.448 --> 40:52.200
not a day has gone by
when I have not thought of you.

40:57.247 --> 40:59.875
- I fear I abandoned you, Alice.
-No.

41:02.878 --> 41:04.379
| left you all alone.

41:05.422 --> 41:09.051
You stayed behind to protect me.
| know that.

41:09.635 --> 41:11.345
You saved my life.

41:11.428 --> 41:14.264
And there's no greater gift
that I could've hoped for.

41:15.891 --> 41:20.437
And you've achieved great things
here in Camelot, whereas, I...

41:21.897 --> 41:24.107
-Alice.
-I've disgraced myself.

41:25.067 --> 41:26.777
After everything I've done,

41:27.903 --> 41:31.114
-you would have every right to hate me.
-Hate you?

41:31.198 --> 41:32.699
| could never hate you.

41:33.617 --> 41:35.994
I've treasured these past days.

41:38.455 --> 41:39.665
| love you, Alice.

41:41.708 --> 41:43.960
| love you, and I always will.

41:47.464 --> 41:49.091
(VOICE BREAKING) As I will you, Gaius.

41:53.887 --> 41:58.266
| don't... I don't want to leave you,
my love.

42:01.311 --> 42:02.604
(ALICE SOBBING)

42:06.775 --> 42:08.276
Don't be afraid.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.571
Please.

42:24.084 --> 42:26.586
(BELLS TOLLING)

42:32.008 --> 42:33.218
Something's happened.

42:33.301 --> 42:35.679
Perhaps one of the prisoners
has escaped.

42:38.974 --> 42:40.308
How is that possible?

42:41.643 --> 42:44.938
| wonder. The dungeons are so secure.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.400
(SIGHING) I really couldn't say.

42:54.322 --> 42:55.532
You could've gone with her.

42:58.827 --> 42:59.953
| could've done.

43:04.458 --> 43:06.710
But then, who'd look after you?

43:07.669 --> 43:10.505
Me? (LAUGHING)
| don't need looking after.

43:10.589 --> 43:11.798
| can fend for myself.

43:11.882 --> 43:15.427
Ah. Well, in that case, you won't be
wanting any of this, then.

43:15.510 --> 43:18.805
(GASPS) Well, maybe just a slice.

43:20.182 --> 43:22.017
(MERLIN LAUGHS)

43:36.323 --> 43:37.991
THE DRAGON: Merlin.

43:38.909 --> 43:42.746
Whatever relationship exists
between Arthur and Gwen,

43:42.829 --> 43:44.164
you must destroy it.

43:45.081 --> 43:48.293
It's almost as though
he's been enchanted.

43:48.710 --> 43:51.213
Uther'll never believe
that Morgana's responsible.

43:51.338 --> 43:52.422
UTHER: Arthur!

43:53.548 --> 43:54.883
She has been found guilty.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.092
You can't do this!

43:57.093 --> 43:59.471
If we can't expose the true sorcerer...

44:00.639 --> 44:02.224
Then we must invent one.
