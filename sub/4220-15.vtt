WEBVTT

00:03.420 --> 00:04.587
Celia! Look at me.

00:04.797 --> 00:06.547
Trust me when I say
we're here to help you.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.216
- Two, three.
- Atta girl.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.176
Thank you, Son.
You're welcome, Pop.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.719
It was everything I wanted
and more.

00:12.596 --> 00:13.596
Pop?

00:18.185 --> 00:19.936
Maybe it's time to put
yourself back on
the market.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.270
I think you're right.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.774
I'm just getting out
of a relationship.

00:24.858 --> 00:25.858
Me too.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.927
Making your getaway?

00:53.762 --> 00:54.762
I'm on shift today.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.056
Didn't I tell you?

00:57.141 --> 00:58.307
I don't think so.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.227
But you know,
we haven't really done
that much talking

01:01.311 --> 01:02.478
since we left the bar
the other night.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.231
Yeah, I guess not.

01:05.774 --> 01:06.816
I mean,

01:07.484 --> 01:09.152
what do we know
about each other, really,

01:09.236 --> 01:10.361
when it comes down to it?

01:10.571 --> 01:13.573
Well, let's see.
Your name is

01:14.158 --> 01:15.241
Crystal.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.912
Gwen? Beth, Beth, Beth.
Your name is Beth.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.957
And you're a hell of
a lot of fun, Beth.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.376
Yeah?

01:25.461 --> 01:26.627
What else?

01:26.712 --> 01:28.129
Let's see.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.756
You own an
Ansel Adams.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.008
20 bucks at Ikea.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.551
Mmm-hmm.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.094
And you smoke
Cuban cigars?

01:35.471 --> 01:36.929
Those belong to my ex.

01:38.182 --> 01:40.224
Sign the papers tomorrow,
and then it's official.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.311
Whose idea was it?
Mine.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.023
We got along fine

01:47.983 --> 01:49.609
but, uh, then his
career hit the skids,

01:51.028 --> 01:53.154
and he became bitter
and vicious.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.073
How come your thing
fell apart?

01:57.534 --> 02:00.077
Just bad timing.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.497
So, it's agreed!

02:03.123 --> 02:05.958
We are both fresh out of
serious relationships,

02:06.084 --> 02:07.794
looking to have
some fun.
Mmm.

02:07.878 --> 02:08.920
Fool around,

02:09.713 --> 02:11.172
go on a cross-country
crime spree?

02:11.840 --> 02:12.840
Absolutely.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.893
I'm glad I got to spend
some time with my father,

02:26.230 --> 02:27.480
and he got
to know all of you.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.150
And now I'm going to
take advantage of
some unused furlough

02:31.235 --> 02:32.527
and wrap up
my father's affairs.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.780
Uh, don't forget, Chief,
you're also entitled to
paternity leave.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.867
I will be taking furlough,
Mouch. And a lot of it.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.621
I know you'll all
be fine without me.

02:43.705 --> 02:44.747
Battalion Chief
Pat Pridgen,

02:44.832 --> 02:46.582
he will fill the void.
Treat him right.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.626
His own house, 17,
was closed last year

02:48.710 --> 02:50.044
by our old friend,
Ms. McLeod.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.130
Oh, come on.

02:53.757 --> 02:54.966
McLeod wasn't all bad,

02:55.884 --> 02:57.426
as soulless
assassins go.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.138
Don't worry
about 51, Chief.

03:02.391 --> 03:03.933
I'll take good care
of it in your absence.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.770
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.

03:08.939 --> 03:09.939
Thanks.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.280
Take as much time
as you need, Chief.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.531
Yeah,
you've earned it.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.241
We're gonna
miss you like hell, Chief.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.951
Yeah,
I'm gonna miss you, too.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.872
Well, some of you.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.166
Hey, Chief,
squad's still
shorthanded.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.002
Are we getting anyone
to sub for Newhouse?

03:31.378 --> 03:33.462
Talk to Chief Pridgen about
that. It's in his hands now.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.174
See you when I see you.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.635
He'll be
back in a week.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.220
He'll be back
next shift.

03:42.806 --> 03:43.806
Yeah?

03:46.435 --> 03:47.768
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.062
What the hell
is he doing here?

03:51.023 --> 03:53.524
What's the matter,
Welch? You lost?

03:53.609 --> 03:54.609
No, I'm good.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.820
I caught a relief
assignment to Squad 3.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.740
Looks like I'll be working
here at 51 for a while.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.258
Welch's own driver
almost died in that crash,

04:19.343 --> 04:21.761
and he was perfectly willing
to let Joe Cruz take the fall,

04:21.845 --> 04:23.429
when in fact he was the one
who ordered his man

04:23.513 --> 04:24.722
to beat 81 to the scene.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.265
Welch has paid
for his mistake.

04:26.850 --> 04:27.975
He's been stripped
of his rank.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.977
This isn't just
about the crash, Chief.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.437
There was a lot of things
leading up to this.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.189
Welch is a pig-headed,
misogynistic...

04:33.649 --> 04:34.815
Do I get a chance to talk?

04:36.693 --> 04:38.069
I'm just trying to give you
the whole story

04:38.153 --> 04:39.779
before you cram him
down our throats.

04:39.863 --> 04:40.947
Gabby.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.199
Are you the officer
in charge of Squad 3?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.076
No, but...
Are you?

04:46.912 --> 04:48.871
Lieutenant Severide
is in charge of Squad 3.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.248
Oh, that's right.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.752
Lieutenant, do you have any
personal conflicts with Welch?

04:55.045 --> 04:56.796
Not directly, no,
but I don't like the guy.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.172
Is he a bad firefighter?

04:58.256 --> 05:00.132
Well, I can't speak for that,
but like Dawson was saying...

05:00.217 --> 05:02.051
Well, I can.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.177
He's a terrific
firefighter.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.931
He doesn't suffer fools,
and maybe that doesn't
make him pleasant company,

05:07.474 --> 05:08.474
but he's got heart.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.725
I'm pinned down
in a flashover,

05:09.810 --> 05:11.227
I want Tommy Welch
coming to get me.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.312
Yeah, well, I'd rather
burn in...
Dawson.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.023
Relief assignments
are not a popularity contest.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.901
So you better learn
to get along with Welch.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.654
Anything else I can
help you with?

05:23.740 --> 05:24.907
No, Chief.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.242
Thanks for
hearing us out.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.880
You empty the pot,
you gotta make a new one.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.298
House rules.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.222
How's your
boy, Molina?

05:48.682 --> 05:50.266
Oh, yeah, he's
up and about.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.476
Hey, your eye's
looking good.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.478
It's getting there.
Getting there.

05:55.522 --> 05:58.274
I hope you're not expecting
a big, warm 51 welcome,
'cause, you know,

05:58.483 --> 05:59.942
we're not exactly thrilled
to have you here.

06:00.277 --> 06:02.069
No, that's okay,
all right.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.154
I'm not here for
the conversation.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.865
I'm here to do a job.
You don't have to like it.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.368
Don't worry about
Welch, all right?

06:09.453 --> 06:10.703
I'll keep him
on a short leash.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.079
I appreciate that.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.164
And look,

06:13.248 --> 06:15.041
if you wanna make him
scrape the gunk out of
the trench drains

06:15.125 --> 06:16.876
on the apparatus floor,
who am I to stop you?

06:16.960 --> 06:19.879
Hey, uh, where the hell
you been past couple nights?

06:19.963 --> 06:21.088
I never saw you come home.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.007
You and Dawson?

06:25.302 --> 06:27.553
You remember the, uh,
the woman I was talking to

06:27.637 --> 06:28.679
the other night
at Molly's?

06:28.764 --> 06:29.889
Yeah, kinda
hard to forget.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.057
Yeah.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.476
You've been with her
this whole time?

06:38.482 --> 06:39.565
What have you done
with Matt Casey?

06:39.649 --> 06:40.649
Oh, get out
of here!

06:40.859 --> 06:42.735
I deserve a little fun,
get my mind off things.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.154
Yeah, of course you do.
Good for you!

06:45.655 --> 06:46.906
Yeah.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.456
Hey,
how's it going, Dawson?

06:56.541 --> 06:57.792
I just wanted
to tell you

06:57.876 --> 06:59.752
that whatever agreement
that you and Casey

06:59.836 --> 07:01.170
had with Chief Boden,

07:01.797 --> 07:02.880
you don't have
to worry about me

07:02.964 --> 07:04.256
blowing your cover
to Pridgen.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.383
Casey and I aren't
together anymore.

07:06.676 --> 07:07.968
Fine. I can play
along with that.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.013
I'm not lying!
Why would...

07:13.183 --> 07:16.352
You know what?
Welcome to 51.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.532
I don't know if
you remember me...

07:29.616 --> 07:31.534
Oh, my God, Celia!

07:32.369 --> 07:33.410
Oh, I almost
didn't recognize you

07:33.495 --> 07:36.038
without the rebar
stuck in your ribs.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.040
How are you?
I'm really good.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.042
Yeah. The stitches
are already out.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.547
Here, I made
this for you.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.048
As, like,
a thank you.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.218
It's beautiful.
I love it!

07:49.302 --> 07:53.556
I just wanted to say,
I really appreciate
you rescuing me,

07:55.851 --> 07:56.892
and what I did
was really stupid,

07:56.977 --> 07:59.019
like, epically stupid.
It's not who I am.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.856
Hey, I was a teenager once.
You make mistakes.

08:01.940 --> 08:02.982
The trick is learning
from them

08:03.066 --> 08:04.275
so you don't
make 'em again.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.528
You must've caught
a lot of hell from
your parents, huh?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.865
It's just my mom,
and she doesn't
really care.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.535
She doesn't care
that you smoked pot
laced with PCP?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.203
She was way more pissed
I lost my guitar

08:16.288 --> 08:17.538
somewhere along the way.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.747
Your guitar?
Yeah.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.875
A halfway decent
solid-top acoustic.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.377
I must have set it down
somewhere when I was
out of my mind.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.505
Now she refuses
to help me get a new one.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.175
Hmm.

08:29.259 --> 08:32.511
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61. Person trapped.

08:32.596 --> 08:33.846
2600, West.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.097
Um, I gotta run.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.807
Uh, hey. Give me
your number.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.434
We can text.
Okay.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.854
Ready?
Yeah.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.984
Okay. So good
to see you.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.612
Bye.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.804
What are we looking at?
Don't know yet.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.097
Somebody called
for help?

09:17.766 --> 09:18.891
Not up here.
In back.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.643
His name is Jerry,
and he's caught
in the pinsetter.

09:20.769 --> 09:21.852
He's caught
in the what?

09:21.937 --> 09:23.312
The pinsetter.
Lane nine.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.112
Hey, Capp,
get a toolbox
in here now.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.240
Copy that Lieutenant.
How do we get to him?

09:34.324 --> 09:35.824
Through the maintenance area
in back. I can show you.

09:35.909 --> 09:36.909
All right, everybody
follow her.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.161
No. No, we should keep
some eyes up front

09:39.579 --> 09:41.455
Casey, Brett,
come with me.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.375
Does he make
a habit of ignoring
his battalion chief?

09:48.129 --> 09:49.713
Hey, guys, get back.
Get off the lane.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.135
81, we need a K-12
with bolt cutters,
right away.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.595
Coming in.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.307
Hey, Jerry,
can you hear me, bud?

10:00.392 --> 10:01.558
Yeah. It hurts!

10:01.643 --> 10:03.060
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, you sit tight.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.353
We're gonna get
you out of there.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.569
What you doing, buddy,
you trying to steal pins?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.613
The pinsetter
arm is jammed.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.031
I'm stuck good!

10:20.370 --> 10:21.662
All right,
this is lane nine.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.379
Capp!

10:30.714 --> 10:32.381
Go around through
the back door over there!

10:32.757 --> 10:33.841
You got it.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.061
Cruz.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.405
Capp, are you there?

10:57.115 --> 10:58.324
Yeah. I'm here,
Severide!

10:58.450 --> 11:00.034
Hand me the biggest
flathead you got.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.754
Hey, Jerry, can
you wiggle your fingers?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.172
I don't know.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.299
Well, barely.

11:16.593 --> 11:17.926
He's diaphoretic,
going into shock!

11:19.220 --> 11:20.763
Hey, what about
that shaft?

11:21.598 --> 11:22.931
If you cut it,
the levers should
separate.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.683
Okay, well, I'm gonna
need a saw.

11:25.727 --> 11:26.727
All right.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.437
Hey! Who's
outside, Otis?

11:29.105 --> 11:31.857
Yeah.
Otis, we need
a reciprocating saw. Now.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.067
On my way.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.944
I'm not getting
a radial pulse.

11:36.654 --> 11:37.946
No blood flow
to the limb.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.282
All right, well,
we're going as fast as
we can here.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.618
Hey, let's
hurry up with that saw!

11:43.036 --> 11:44.078
Watch your step.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.416
All right, Jerry,
hang in there, bud,
all right?

11:49.501 --> 11:50.959
You're just gonna feel
a little buzz, okay?

12:02.514 --> 12:03.514
Hang on, bud.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.774
Here. Here.

12:14.943 --> 12:15.943
- All right!
- Pull.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.494
All right, let's go.
Let's go.

12:29.541 --> 12:30.999
Okay, everybody,
let's wrap it up.

12:34.879 --> 12:35.879
Phew.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.131
Whoa.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.969
Oh. Oh, hey, you
okay there, Zvone? Uh...

12:43.179 --> 12:44.930
How do you
pronounce his name?
Otis.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.140
You okay there, Otis?

12:50.854 --> 12:52.688
Stay off that thing,
they wax the lanes!

12:57.694 --> 12:59.361
What, has this guy never
gone bowling before?

13:01.406 --> 13:03.031
Come on, little
buddy. Come on!

13:03.658 --> 13:05.826
Don't give up hope,
we're all pulling
for you. Come on!

13:14.502 --> 13:15.586
I knew you had it in you!

13:18.047 --> 13:19.047
Thanks.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.926
Okay, folks, I think
we all learned a valuable
lesson here today.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.596
Keep your heads
out of the gutter.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.185
I'm fine.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.153
Hey, what's going on?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.280
Yeah, we just left
the hospital.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.908
Looks like the guy's
gonna keep his arm.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.453
Oh, man, I can't believe
we missed that.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.583
Wait, hang on,
let me tell Brett.

13:55.293 --> 13:56.960
Otis slipped on
the bowling lane

13:57.045 --> 13:58.337
and fell right
on his ass.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.172
You know how they
wax the floors?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.340
Cool. Um.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.217
Will you wait
just a minute?

14:03.301 --> 14:05.010
I'm gonna go price
out a guitar.

14:06.429 --> 14:07.429
Uh...

14:31.871 --> 14:33.872
You can do that.
Wherever, you can
just take it.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.124
Lieutenant Severide,
a moment?

14:36.834 --> 14:37.834
Chief?

14:44.384 --> 14:45.801
That was, uh,

14:45.927 --> 14:47.761
quick, clear thinking
you exhibited back there.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.222
And I like that you aren't
afraid to push back on

14:50.306 --> 14:52.224
an order when
the situation
calls for it.

14:55.812 --> 14:56.895
Thanks.

14:56.980 --> 14:58.480
CFD could use
more officers like you.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.488
You didn't get hurt,
did you, buddy?

15:07.907 --> 15:10.200
Otis. Everyone
calls me Otis.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.618
No, you kidding me?

15:12.161 --> 15:13.870
From now on,
your name's Gutterball.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.584
Cut him some
slack, Chief.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.128
It could've happened
to any of us.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.505
Uh, he's lucky he lost
his footing on a bowling alley

15:23.590 --> 15:24.923
and not a pitched
roof, Lieutenant.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.508
A screw up's a screw up.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.808
A nickname is basically
a term of endearment, Otis.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.520
Otis already
is a nickname!

15:40.231 --> 15:41.523
Oh, yeah.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.031
Beth?

15:49.907 --> 15:51.825
Hey.
Matt, hey!

15:51.909 --> 15:53.201
How'd you know
where to find me?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.203
I didn't think I mentioned
what house I worked out of.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.414
I actually wasn't
looking for you.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.665
I'm here meeting
my ex-husband.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.376
We're, um,
finalizing today.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.676
Uh, your ex
works here at 51?

16:10.053 --> 16:11.053
Yep.

16:15.558 --> 16:16.558
Wow.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.315
So, we're really
going through with
this, huh, Beth?

16:31.157 --> 16:32.699
Fine, let's get it
over with.

16:47.131 --> 16:48.423
Pat Pridgen?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.634
You're married
to Battalion Chief
Pat Pridgen?

16:50.718 --> 16:51.718
Not anymore.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.512
Beth!

16:56.599 --> 17:00.352
How did we spend 48 hours
together without making
that connection?

17:00.436 --> 17:03.355
Well, I certainly wasn't
hiding anything from you.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.482
Point taken,
but obviously,

17:06.693 --> 17:08.652
we need to nip this
in the bud right now.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.278
Well, I thought
we were having fun.
We were.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.406
We're also racing headlong
toward disaster.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.783
Pat and I are divorced!

17:14.867 --> 17:16.284
So what?

17:16.369 --> 17:18.412
He's obviously still
carrying a torch for you.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.288
Well, it doesn't matter.
I'm a free woman.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.958
But I'm not a free
man. I work for him.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.085
He finds out
I'm sleeping with
his ex-wife,

17:25.169 --> 17:26.211
he'll end my career.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.338
Well, then, let's not
tell him, okay?

17:29.298 --> 17:30.507
Beth!
Matt!

17:31.300 --> 17:33.593
Come on.
I can keep a secret.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.429
Can't you?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.318
So, I talked to Angie
from Chicago Med.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.738
She was on shift
the night Celia's mother
came to pick her up,

17:53.156 --> 17:56.408
way more worried about
the hospital bills than
her daughter's condition.

17:56.701 --> 17:59.327
She actually tried
to stop the doctor
from treating Celia.

17:59.829 --> 18:03.832
There have been
ongoing issues with
family services and,

18:04.292 --> 18:06.668
anyway, that's
the story behind this.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.630
Oh, yeah,
that's busted again.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.507
I already called
the landlord twice.

18:15.887 --> 18:17.637
I could ask Casey
to come fix it.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.018
Dawson, you gotta be strong.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.772
Separation is exactly
what you guys need.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.523
Yeah,
I'm not so sure.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.734
Come on,
Harrison and I
dated for years,

18:30.818 --> 18:34.029
and I could never see
our relationship for what
it really was until he left.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.034
So stop dwelling
on Casey for a while.

18:42.538 --> 18:43.538
You could go on a date.

18:51.214 --> 18:55.967
The itsy bitsy
spider something something.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.395
Hey, hey,
easy now!
Thank God.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.815
Save some
of that energy for the game!

19:10.691 --> 19:13.068
Hey, Chief.
Boy, am I glad
to see you.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.861
Hey, Chief,
what games you got?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.823
Luke, do not touch
that computer, all right?

19:17.907 --> 19:19.324
We're not gonna...

19:19.408 --> 19:20.826
Okay, you know what?

19:20.910 --> 19:24.412
Let's all go downstairs!
Come on, get downstairs,
watch TV!

19:24.497 --> 19:27.123
Yeah!
I give up!

19:27.250 --> 19:29.501
Um, I watched
a dozen videos.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.294
I know I got this
swaddling thing down,

19:31.379 --> 19:32.838
but the baby
kept on crying.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.089
All right.

19:34.632 --> 19:35.632
Yeah.
Yeah?

19:37.093 --> 19:38.802
Yeah, easy, easy, easy.
Got it down now.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.515
You know, uh,
it's too dirty
down there.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.766
We haven't
vacuumed in days.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.309
He'll live, I promise.

19:47.854 --> 19:48.854
Hey.

19:51.607 --> 19:52.691
You're a genius at this.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.280
Tell Cindy.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.324
How's it going
at the firehouse?

20:01.659 --> 20:03.577
Ah, there's a little
sand in the gears,

20:03.661 --> 20:04.703
what with Welch coming in.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.706
Welch?
Yeah.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.166
Pridgen brought in Welch
to sub for Newhouse.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.335
Tommy Welch is in
my firehouse?

20:14.046 --> 20:17.048
You didn't call me over here
for parenting advice, did you?

20:19.760 --> 20:21.720
Donna won't
let me wrap up
my father's affairs.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.055
She took over
the whole damn operation,

20:24.140 --> 20:26.224
left me here with
the little one like I'm
some kind of a wet nurse.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.935
I'm a fire chief, Herrmann.
I'm a leader of men.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.689
Tommy Welch is
in my firehouse?

20:32.773 --> 20:35.066
All right. You know what?
Forget I said anything,
all right?

20:35.151 --> 20:38.361
It's not your problem.
All right? We can handle it.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.244
Is that a pocket knife
on that key ring?

20:46.913 --> 20:49.706
He'll never get
that thing open.
Those tiny fingers?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.216
Hey, buddy!
Hey!

21:01.844 --> 21:03.803
It takes five hours to
break up with someone?

21:03.888 --> 21:05.472
It wasn't five hours.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.186
You slept with her,
didn't you?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.270
Mmm...

21:12.355 --> 21:15.023
Casey, what the hell
are you thinking?
They're divorced!

21:15.149 --> 21:16.775
Yeah,
I'll try to remind
Pridgen of that

21:16.859 --> 21:19.903
when he orders everyone
to pull back and leaves you
inside a burning building.

21:20.237 --> 21:23.531
You got to end this thing,
now, before he finds out.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.617
Really.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.536
What? What is so funny?

21:29.872 --> 21:30.997
Well, you know
you're in trouble

21:31.082 --> 21:32.582
when even
Kelly Severide thinks

21:32.667 --> 21:33.750
you're behaving recklessly.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.835
Hey, man, I never slept
with the chief's wife.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.045
Ex-wife.

21:47.723 --> 21:48.723
Hey, Gabby.

21:55.940 --> 21:57.399
Again, I'm really
sorry about this.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.566
It's just the water.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.527
It's only coming
out of the faucet,
not the sprayer,

22:00.611 --> 22:01.987
and Sunday rates
for a plumber, I mean.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.823
Really, it's not
a big deal.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.994
Hey, I like your place.

22:09.370 --> 22:10.412
Oh, thanks.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.497
Yeah, I, I mean,
it's Brett's place,
really, but yeah.

22:13.416 --> 22:14.416
Yeah.

22:15.626 --> 22:16.793
She went to get
you a six pack.

22:16.877 --> 22:17.961
It's the least
we could do.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.296
I'm telling you,
this is a simple fix.

22:22.216 --> 22:23.425
All right, ta-da!

22:26.387 --> 22:27.554
Damn it!

22:28.472 --> 22:31.182
"Oh, it's a simple fix.
A child could do it!"

22:31.267 --> 22:33.184
Well, I'm not
a plumber by trade.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.853
Oh, yeah, you don't say.

22:35.813 --> 22:38.815
Oh, hey, hey, hey, look,
I'm sorry. It's just,
that was, that was funny.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.525
That was funny.
You can't deny it.

22:40.609 --> 22:41.776
I'm gonna
get you a towel.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.954
A highball is whiskey,
ginger ale and lemon.
Everybody knows that.

22:53.039 --> 22:56.541
Technically speaking,
it's any spirit served
with a mixer.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.710
Gin and tonic,
rum and coke,
what have you.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.211
Please.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.589
Hey, let's ask
our local mixologist.

23:02.673 --> 23:04.966
Herrmann, what's
a highball?
He will not know.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.177
Not to be confused
with a Gutterball.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.266
You know what, Capp?

23:13.350 --> 23:14.768
How about you and me,
we go outside?

23:15.019 --> 23:16.728
Touchy.
Come on.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.522
Hey, he's just
ribbing you, Otis,
take it easy.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.274
No, no, I'm not gonna
take it easy.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.318
Can you guys
imagine Chief Boden

23:23.402 --> 23:25.820
ever treating any of us
like that, huh?

23:25.905 --> 23:29.574
Mocking us?
Humiliating us?
I'm asking you!

23:30.117 --> 23:33.536
Whoa, no, all right?
Boden would never do that.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.080
No, of course not.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.874
Boden's a leader.
He inspires us.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.836
Not like Pridgen though.
That guy's a douche.

23:44.799 --> 23:46.549
The next guy
who calls me a Gutterball

23:46.634 --> 23:47.801
is gonna lose some teeth.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.497
Sylvie! Uh, hi.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.208
Ta-da!
Oh, my God!

24:20.668 --> 24:22.335
Where did this
come from?
I hope it's okay.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.003
The guy at the store
said it was a good one.

24:24.088 --> 24:25.588
It's nicer than
the one I lost.

24:26.841 --> 24:28.174
You bought this for me?

24:28.259 --> 24:29.259
What's going on?

24:29.802 --> 24:31.219
Uh, Mom,
this is Sylvie.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.304
She's the paramedic
who saved me.

24:33.806 --> 24:35.390
This is my mom, Sharon.

24:36.225 --> 24:37.225
Hi, Sharon.

24:37.768 --> 24:38.852
What's this?

24:38.936 --> 24:41.521
Uh, well, I know Celia
lost her guitar that day,

24:41.605 --> 24:43.565
and I was driving
by a pawn shop on Clark

24:43.649 --> 24:47.152
where I once performed
the Heimlich maneuver
on the owner, so I thought,

24:47.236 --> 24:48.903
"Hey, maybe
I can get a deal."
Give it back.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.782
Mom.
Uh, no, please,
I want her to have it.

24:52.867 --> 24:54.659
You think I can't look
after my own daughter?

24:55.452 --> 24:56.661
What? No, I...

24:56.745 --> 24:59.205
I worked
two weeks of overtime
to buy her that guitar

24:59.290 --> 25:01.082
and she just left it
on a curb somewhere.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.835
She needs to know,
things cost money.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.424
You know,
Celia very nearly
died that day.

25:11.886 --> 25:14.262
Don't you think you should
cut her a little slack?

25:15.431 --> 25:17.015
I'll raise my own
daughter, thanks.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.517
Mom, she's my friend!
Stay away from her.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.235
He's gonna love it.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.528
Had a buddy of mine
print it up.

25:30.613 --> 25:31.821
Hey,
what's going on?

25:31.906 --> 25:35.450
Hey, there he is,
just the man
I wanted to see.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.535
Got you a present.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.121
Huh?

25:42.124 --> 25:44.709
One of a kind.
One of a kind.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.505
Don't tell me I never
did anything for you.

25:49.590 --> 25:50.798
Wow, look at that.

25:51.759 --> 25:52.717
That's hilarious.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.510
No, no, no,
you gotta put it on.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.554
I promised my buddy
I'd get a picture
of you wearing it.

25:56.639 --> 25:57.972
His shop did
the embroidering.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.475
Look.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.102
Come on, don't be such
a wet blanket.

26:03.187 --> 26:05.480
Hey, Chief,
you know, joke's a joke,
but we don't got to have...

26:05.564 --> 26:06.648
But what?

26:07.191 --> 26:08.316
You want a shirt, too?

26:08.817 --> 26:10.902
I can see if my buddy
can do a triple-XL for you.

26:13.447 --> 26:15.657
Eh, that's okay,
Chief. You know what?

26:16.325 --> 26:17.325
We're all good here.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.576
Pat.

26:21.664 --> 26:22.872
You got a minute?

26:23.666 --> 26:25.959
'Course, Beth. Of course.

26:34.969 --> 26:36.427
I asked around
about this guy.

26:37.346 --> 26:38.763
You know how
he made chief?

26:39.807 --> 26:42.225
Ten years riding a desk
at fire prevention.

26:42.476 --> 26:44.269
Figures.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.146
Under his command,
17 was one of the worst
run houses in the city.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.816
That's why they
shut it down.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.862
And yet, like a cockroach,
he just keeps going.

26:55.364 --> 26:56.781
Oh,
he's a survivor, this one.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.741
He plays the angles

26:59.910 --> 27:01.536
and he don't like to lose.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.877
Beth? What are
you doing here?

27:10.296 --> 27:13.798
Well, I had to drop off
Pat's notarized copy of
the divorce papers.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.426
You had to?

27:17.720 --> 27:19.887
There was no other way
to get it to him, huh?

27:20.556 --> 27:22.056
Like the U.S. Mail?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.516
Well, I guess
I could have mailed it,

27:23.600 --> 27:25.727
but then I couldn't
get to sneak a kiss
with you

27:25.811 --> 27:27.228
in Chief Pridgen's
firehouse.

27:27.688 --> 27:28.980
You know,
just for the
thrill of it.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.732
Uh...

27:32.276 --> 27:34.068
We can't do this.
Oh, I'll make it quick.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.655
I'm not talking about a kiss,
I'm talking about us.

27:38.032 --> 27:39.073
This has to stop.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.075
You're a firefighter,

27:41.160 --> 27:42.535
can't you handle
a little bit of danger?

27:42.619 --> 27:46.205
Sure, but, uh...
I've realized

27:47.541 --> 27:49.250
that this isn't
what I want.

27:51.462 --> 27:52.587
As fun as it's been.

27:52.963 --> 27:54.630
Okay, fair enough.

27:56.759 --> 27:57.759
What are you doing?

27:58.635 --> 28:01.012
But it has been fun.
You're right about that.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.071
Seemed like a good
idea at the time,

28:18.155 --> 28:19.906
marrying a woman
ten years my junior.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.033
Hell, I thought
I won the lottery.

28:22.951 --> 28:24.452
Couldn't have
been more wrong.
Really?

28:25.662 --> 28:27.663
She seems like
a sweet person.
That's the problem.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.458
Everybody loves her,
and she loved
the attention.

28:31.001 --> 28:33.920
Look, you take a woman
like that out to a bar,
she's gonna turn heads.

28:34.004 --> 28:35.171
It's inevitable.

28:35.255 --> 28:37.006
Beth, she would
encourage it.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.634
Loves to stir up trouble.

28:40.177 --> 28:41.427
Let's just say,
more than once

28:41.512 --> 28:43.888
some young buck
would come sniffing around

28:43.972 --> 28:46.057
and I'd have to
knock him on his ass.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.185
And she calls me the flirt.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.354
Hmm.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.688
Seems strange
she would dump a guy

28:52.773 --> 28:54.816
who picks a fight
everywhere he goes.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.324
Hey, you tried.

29:03.659 --> 29:04.742
The kid's got
a lousy mom.

29:04.827 --> 29:06.369
You can't beat
yourself up over that.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.330
I know what it's like when
you can't rely on a parent.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.418
When I was in the ninth grade,
my dad was traveling a lot.

29:13.502 --> 29:19.048
And my mom
had sort of a
nervous breakdown.

29:20.551 --> 29:21.551
For real?

29:23.387 --> 29:24.387
Yeah.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.641
But her sister, um,
my Aunt Ann,

29:30.352 --> 29:33.396
she stepped in,
and she didn't take
my mom's place,

29:33.480 --> 29:36.190
but she picked up the slack.

29:37.651 --> 29:38.651
I just,

29:39.862 --> 29:42.029
I wish I could do that
for Celia, you know?

29:43.699 --> 29:46.868
But her mom is obviously
not going to let that happen.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.497
Well, you sort of
wounded the woman's pride.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.042
Maybe if you try
and find a way

29:55.127 --> 29:56.961
to help that's
not so intrusive.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.854
Severide, come on in.
Close the door.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.150
What can I do
for you, Chief?

30:19.234 --> 30:20.234
Ah...

30:22.696 --> 30:24.864
I wanted to get
your take on
Lieutenant Casey.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.657
You mean,
my good friend
and roommate,

30:26.742 --> 30:27.742
that Lieutenant Casey?

30:28.410 --> 30:31.913
This would
of course be an entirely
confidential discussion.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.250
Okay, well,

30:37.544 --> 30:40.254
Matt Casey is about
one of the finest
firefighters

30:40.339 --> 30:42.632
I've had the
opportunity to work with
in the entire CFD.

30:42.716 --> 30:44.592
Mmm, he runs
a sloppy company.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.845
And he lacks respect
for his superiors.

30:47.930 --> 30:48.930
I disagree,

30:50.307 --> 30:52.642
but you're entitled
to your opinion.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.440
If there's nothing else...

31:01.151 --> 31:02.485
Help me keep
an eye on him.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.279
Keep an eye on Casey?

31:06.990 --> 31:08.491
I'll make it worth
your while.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.703
Chief, this kind of stuff,

31:12.788 --> 31:16.123
this scheming behind
closed doors,

31:17.334 --> 31:19.001
and keeping an eye
on other officers,

31:20.629 --> 31:22.463
that's not how we
do things here at 51.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.553
Hey,

31:29.638 --> 31:31.472
I'm just performing
my due diligence.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.349
Forget I brought it up.

31:36.395 --> 31:40.356
Engine 51,
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Ambulance 61.

31:40.440 --> 31:44.235
Battalion 25. Structure fire.
984 Northpoint.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.469
Hey, Casey,
we'll do the primary search.

32:10.554 --> 32:12.138
Negative, Squad.
You're on RIT.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.514
81 goes in first.

32:15.183 --> 32:16.183
It's all yours, Casey.

32:22.399 --> 32:25.735
Dawson, Herrmann,
Otis, with me.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.194
Cruz, Mouch,
vent the roof.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.533
Watch your step,
Gutterball!

32:48.717 --> 32:50.384
Herrmann,
you and me upstairs!

32:50.719 --> 32:53.638
Otis and Dawson,
take the first floor.
Do a clockwise search.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.014
- Got it.
- Okay!

33:02.064 --> 33:04.315
Dawson, you take
the first room.
I'll take this one.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.068
Okay. Fire
department, call out!

33:11.156 --> 33:12.615
Fire department, call out!

33:16.328 --> 33:17.328
Fire department!

33:17.913 --> 33:19.038
Call out!

33:28.215 --> 33:29.590
Fire department!

33:41.520 --> 33:42.520
Here, I'll get her.

33:42.604 --> 33:43.938
I got her.
Make a hole.

33:44.481 --> 33:45.648
Hey, hole, hole!

33:59.579 --> 34:00.913
Hey, this guy's
in bad shape!

34:08.046 --> 34:09.296
I got a pulse,
he's breathing.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.924
Uh, let's get
an IV in him and get
some oxygen, okay?

34:13.635 --> 34:14.802
I found the fire!

34:17.264 --> 34:18.264
Send me some water!

34:33.530 --> 34:36.532
Where's my water, 51?
This place is about to
flashover!

34:37.242 --> 34:38.242
Coming right up.

35:02.184 --> 35:04.602
Mayday! Mayday!
I'm trapped in the back
of the first floor.

35:04.686 --> 35:05.978
I can't open the door!

35:06.813 --> 35:08.105
Hey, Welch,
let's get him!

35:14.571 --> 35:15.821
Otis, Call out!

35:16.364 --> 35:17.740
He dragged a hose
in that way!

35:22.871 --> 35:23.871
Here.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.541
Hey, Welch,
hit the hinges!

35:35.383 --> 35:36.383
Otis!

35:37.511 --> 35:38.511
Get him!

36:02.744 --> 36:04.954
Folks,
I think we all learned
a lesson here today

36:05.038 --> 36:06.747
about why we
don't freelance.

36:07.791 --> 36:08.958
Isn't that right,
Gutterball?

36:12.087 --> 36:13.587
Don't talk to my
guy like that.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.007
What did you say?
He made
a great save today.

36:17.384 --> 36:18.884
That old man
would be dead
if not for him.

36:19.261 --> 36:21.053
And if he got a little
too eager out there,

36:22.055 --> 36:23.639
it's only because
he was trying to
prove himself to you.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.182
I don't like your
tone, Lieutenant.

36:25.642 --> 36:26.934
I don't like yours.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.478
Otis and everyone
else here at 51,

36:29.563 --> 36:31.063
they've already
proven themselves.

36:31.147 --> 36:34.233
You ought to treat them
with respect, Chief.

36:37.779 --> 36:40.072
I want you in my office
in five minutes, Lieutenant!

36:41.283 --> 36:42.283
You too, Severide!

36:51.084 --> 36:52.251
That was really
stupid of you.

36:54.754 --> 36:55.754
But thanks.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.806
I don't know how
Chief Boden ran
his firehouse,

37:07.559 --> 37:09.059
whether he kept it
loose and casual,

37:09.144 --> 37:10.477
or maybe
you two are just

37:10.562 --> 37:12.521
taking advantage
now that the cat's away.

37:12.606 --> 37:14.023
But you are making
a big mistake

37:14.107 --> 37:15.399
if you think you can
walk all over me.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.360
I will not abide
insubordination.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.114
How dare you talk
to me that way?

37:24.284 --> 37:26.577
And you, disobeying
a direct order

37:26.661 --> 37:27.786
at that bowling
alley call.

37:28.705 --> 37:30.080
The thing you
commended me for?

37:30.165 --> 37:31.498
Insubordination
all the same.

37:32.667 --> 37:33.667
We get it, Chief.

37:35.462 --> 37:38.797
I'm sure we can all learn
to live together until Boden
returns in a few weeks.

37:39.049 --> 37:40.341
I wouldn't
assume anything.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.927
We don't know
how much time
Chief Boden needs,

37:43.261 --> 37:46.430
or if the department's
even gonna have him
back here to 51.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.974
For now,
I am your Chief,

37:49.059 --> 37:50.893
and I could take formal
action against you two.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.019
That is my right.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.439
But I like to work
these things out
in-house.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.900
That's why Truck 81
and Squad 3

37:57.984 --> 38:00.694
are gonna go outside
and wash all the windows.
Immediately.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.863
Uh, it's 15 degrees out.

38:02.948 --> 38:06.116
You want us to take
all our men outside
and wash windows?

38:06.201 --> 38:07.368
Send
as many you want.

38:08.203 --> 38:09.328
Just see that
it gets done.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.291
That'll be all.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.399
- He's asleep.
- Good.

38:39.734 --> 38:40.818
You know,
you're probably
gonna wanna hear

38:40.902 --> 38:42.152
about the conversation
that I just had

38:42.237 --> 38:43.237
with your dad's bank.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.571
Later, tell me later.

38:47.742 --> 38:49.994
Well, then maybe
you wanna call Christopher

38:50.078 --> 38:52.121
and get the latest dispatch
from Firehouse 51.

38:52.664 --> 38:53.747
No.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.583
Got all I need
right here.

38:59.212 --> 39:00.212
Just you and him.

39:15.020 --> 39:16.395
Well, it's really
nice of you,

39:16.479 --> 39:18.689
but I don't
think my mom
will let me have it.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.108
Oh, uh,
it's not for you.
I'm keeping it.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.277
You play?
No.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.071
But it'll be here
at the house,

39:26.156 --> 39:28.365
and you can come by
anytime you want

39:29.117 --> 39:30.451
and use it for as long
as you want.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.203
Uh... I wouldn't wanna
be in the way.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.080
Celia, this is a safe place
for you to hang out,

39:36.082 --> 39:38.083
and you're welcome anytime.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.136
You're really cool,
you know that?

40:03.068 --> 40:04.318
Nice work,
Aunty Ann.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.374
Well, folks, I think
we all learned

40:19.459 --> 40:21.335
a valuable lesson today.

40:24.339 --> 40:26.131
Whoa, whoa, hey.
Huh?

40:26.216 --> 40:27.382
This will
cheer us up.

40:28.510 --> 40:29.510
Hey!

40:30.303 --> 40:31.804
Nice.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.516
Wow, Cubans, huh?
Where'd you score these?

40:35.767 --> 40:38.060
Chief Pridgen.
Only he doesn't know.

40:56.329 --> 40:58.038
Hey, good save
back there today, Dawson.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.999
That lady was
clinging to you
for dear life.

41:05.755 --> 41:07.673
Hey, look, I know
we got our history,
all right,

41:07.757 --> 41:09.716
but I just want
this job to work.

41:12.053 --> 41:14.263
Well, it's not going to
if we don't feel like
you've got our backs.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.393
Okay, how's this?

41:20.687 --> 41:23.147
I'm sorry that I didn't
take you at your word
the other day,

41:23.231 --> 41:24.731
about you and Casey
splitting up.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.483
I believe it now.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.819
But you should let
your lieutenant know,

41:28.903 --> 41:30.988
that he can't
be making out
with the Chief's ex

41:31.072 --> 41:32.197
on the apparatus floor,

41:32.824 --> 41:34.324
or Pridgen will
destroy him.
