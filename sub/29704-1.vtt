00:45.016 --> 00:47.352
They do.
Look at the bark and the leaves.

00:48.086 --> 00:48.954
And, uh...

00:50.522 --> 00:51.890
I think it's over there.

00:51.990 --> 00:53.058
Okay.

00:56.496 --> 00:58.030
And I think one of
them is a conifer. Like say...

00:58.131 --> 01:00.098
- Conifer?
- No, Conifer.

01:00.299 --> 01:02.000
- What is that?
- Conifers!

01:02.234 --> 01:04.036
- What is that?
- It's like a type of tree!

01:04.303 --> 01:06.038
- Coniferous tree.
- I don't know.

01:06.138 --> 01:07.373
This whole tree talk
is freaking me out.

01:07.473 --> 01:09.208
Coniferous. Cauliflowers.

01:09.309 --> 01:11.277
Okay, what's this fascination
with trees, by the way?

01:12.312 --> 01:13.779
I'm happy to be here.
That's all.

01:14.247 --> 01:15.748
All right.

01:42.543 --> 01:44.778
All right, good.
Well let's see, oh, wow.

01:45.045 --> 01:46.780
- Oh, yay.
- Oh, this is nice.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.881
- Yes, it is.
- Nicer than I expected.

01:48.982 --> 01:50.984
- You know what it reminds me of?
- What's that?

01:51.084 --> 01:53.153
- It's like Steve's cabin a little.
- Steve's cabin?

01:53.254 --> 01:54.888
- Yes!
- What are you kidding me?

01:54.989 --> 01:56.156
Steve's cabin is haunted.

01:56.257 --> 01:57.791
It kind of is.
You're right.

01:57.891 --> 01:59.260
It is. I told him, too.

01:59.927 --> 02:04.031
Oh, this is cool. Hey, I think babe,
there are actual beds up there.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.435
- And plumbing.
- Yes, there's plumbing, you big baby.

02:07.535 --> 02:10.538
Okay, why don't you put our clothes
away, then I'll start a fire.

02:10.639 --> 02:11.972
Yeah. Of course.

02:19.281 --> 02:20.982
<i>You know that's not a
real fireplace, right?</i>

02:21.383 --> 02:22.817
Yeah, but this is nice.

02:24.486 --> 02:28.256
I just want one romantic weekend
with you before I bloat up.

02:29.558 --> 02:31.127
In a few weeks you won't
even want to touch me.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.794
No.

02:33.296 --> 02:34.163
That's not true.

02:35.131 --> 02:36.231
Okay.

02:36.598 --> 02:37.532
I like this.

02:40.135 --> 02:41.236
It's not so bad?

02:42.971 --> 02:44.206
Not so bad, he says!

03:15.272 --> 03:16.139
Babe?

03:17.240 --> 03:18.576
- Mmph.
- Why are the car lights on?

03:18.676 --> 03:20.578
What? I don't know.

03:21.111 --> 03:24.281
- Did you hit the clicker or something?
- No. It's over there.

03:26.483 --> 03:28.251
What if someone's out
there messing with the car?

03:28.352 --> 03:30.320
Baby, there's no
one around here for miles.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.521
You should go check
or the battery

03:31.622 --> 03:32.856
will be dead by morning.

03:32.956 --> 03:33.924
Come on.

03:34.991 --> 03:35.892
Come on.

03:36.427 --> 03:37.295
Okay.

04:18.570 --> 04:19.438
Whoo.

04:24.109 --> 04:25.210
Shit.

04:32.452 --> 04:33.319
Ray?

04:45.265 --> 04:46.132
Shit.

04:51.672 --> 04:52.540
Ray?

04:56.510 --> 04:58.077
Ray, it's not funny!

05:06.019 --> 05:06.687
Ray!

05:15.129 --> 05:16.363
Ray, where are you?

05:54.302 --> 05:55.771
Please! I'm begging you!

05:55.872 --> 05:57.038
Please, don't kill me!

05:57.138 --> 05:58.073
Don't touch me!

06:47.357 --> 06:48.592
When's Key
Club meet this week?

06:48.692 --> 06:50.360
- Thursday.
- Wednesday.

06:50.460 --> 06:53.096
- Lunch.
- Wait, Wednesday?

06:53.196 --> 06:55.333
I thought we had a yearbook
meeting on Wednesday?

06:55.433 --> 06:57.468
Yeah, I got practice Wednesday.
I can't make that.

06:58.436 --> 06:59.571
What do you mean?
You can't go to practice,

07:00.604 --> 07:01.471
we have to make our
list of possible sponsors.

07:02.874 --> 07:03.607
I don't know what you want me to say.
I've got a game Saturday.

07:04.174 --> 07:04.575
I can't miss practice.

07:05.009 --> 07:05.509
Yeah. I'm out.

07:06.209 --> 07:07.812
AV Club has a budget meeting.

07:08.278 --> 07:10.381
I give up! We'll just figure
it out without you.

07:10.481 --> 07:11.416
Fine.

07:11.516 --> 07:12.483
Now...

07:18.323 --> 07:19.357
...about the cabin.

07:23.429 --> 07:25.163
Yeah, I hate working outside.

07:25.263 --> 07:26.764
- Yeah. Me too.
- What?

07:27.365 --> 07:28.834
She didn't see us coming at all.
It was perfect!

07:29.300 --> 07:31.269
Yeah, because her little
lamp sucked.

07:31.737 --> 07:33.572
If she'd had that Maglite
with her from the beginning,

07:33.672 --> 07:35.808
- we'd have been screwed.
- But she didn't.

07:36.275 --> 07:38.110
You know, really, I should
have been in the car.

07:38.510 --> 07:40.512
I thought we agreed that she
wasn't going to get into the car.

07:41.180 --> 07:43.449
Well, no, but she goes for
the door handle, and bam!

07:43.549 --> 07:45.417
My mask lit up in
the driver's seat!

07:45.517 --> 07:47.386
She falls back and you're
all there to grab her!

07:47.487 --> 07:49.253
Yeah but I mean that's
the point.

07:49.355 --> 07:51.323
She runs away, she thinks she's

07:51.423 --> 07:54.193
home free and then, her legs

07:54.293 --> 07:55.327
get swept up from under her.

07:56.328 --> 07:57.764
You get to see the light
leave her eyes. Right?

07:58.263 --> 07:59.398
Mmm.

08:00.366 --> 08:01.901
Remember back in June?
The beach?

08:02.435 --> 08:04.738
We all showed up at once.
We scared the fuck out of them.

08:04.838 --> 08:06.640
Yeah. That was, was pretty good.

08:06.740 --> 08:09.709
Pretty good? Did you see the
look on that lady's face, man?

08:09.810 --> 08:11.277
She was like, ahh!

08:15.815 --> 08:16.683
Sorry!

08:17.584 --> 08:19.552
Okay, okay.
Next time we go together.

08:19.886 --> 08:21.454
And no more outdoors.

08:21.554 --> 08:22.422
Oh, come on!

08:24.925 --> 08:25.826
All right.

08:26.494 --> 08:27.528
No more outdoors.

08:28.396 --> 08:29.262
Thanks, baby.

10:21.345 --> 10:23.782
I don't know. I think you got
lucky. With the axe.

10:23.882 --> 10:24.883
What if it wasn't lying around?

10:24.983 --> 10:26.584
What if it was dull?

10:26.684 --> 10:27.519
I don't know.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.854
Piece of wood?
Rock? Something.

10:29.954 --> 10:31.055
- A piece of wood?
- What?

10:32.191 --> 10:34.927
Oh, uh, our logo for our
Habitats and Humanity affiliate.

10:35.425 --> 10:36.861
Kupperman wants it on
his desk by Friday.

10:38.395 --> 10:39.831
And so a piece of wood is the...

10:40.364 --> 10:41.800
Hammer and nail seemed
too obvious.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.369
Okay. Did you get a chance
to look at the posters

10:44.469 --> 10:45.870
for the blood drive
or do I have to...

10:45.970 --> 10:48.373
Uh, If you just show
it to Harrison,

10:48.473 --> 10:49.975
you can start putting it up.

10:50.542 --> 10:51.777
- All right, sounds good.
- Cool.

10:52.945 --> 10:54.647
- -How would you
have used a piece of wood?

10:54.747 --> 10:55.581
I don't know, Jenny.

10:55.681 --> 10:56.549
Fucking sharpen it.

10:57.049 --> 10:58.784
Oh, fuck me! Jesus Christ!

11:00.019 --> 11:01.686
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

11:01.786 --> 11:02.620
Would wood have worked?

11:03.688 --> 11:04.622
Is that supposed
to be a tongue twister?

11:05.624 --> 11:06.759
- No, instead of the axe.
- Oh.

11:06.859 --> 11:07.893
Hey.

11:07.993 --> 11:09.795
- Hey!
- Where were you last night?

11:09.895 --> 11:11.397
I texted you like six times.

11:11.497 --> 11:12.865
And two of those
were cat videos.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.001
Yeah. I saw.
I, um, was writing a paper...

11:15.101 --> 11:17.403
I know. No distractions
while you're working.

11:18.004 --> 11:20.406
- You get me.
- That I do.

11:20.607 --> 11:22.909
Oh, I got the tripod
for tomorrow. We still good?

11:23.009 --> 11:25.945
- Oh, could we actually do it later this week?
- What's the tripod for?

11:26.512 --> 11:29.548
- Uh, she's helping me film my dance application.
- Oh.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.685
- She's a really good dancer.
- Yeah, she is.

11:32.652 --> 11:34.754
- Um, I guess I'll see you later then?
- Yeah.

11:35.021 --> 11:36.456
- For sure.
- Okay, bye.

11:36.556 --> 11:37.390
Bye.

11:40.027 --> 11:41.394
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:42.562 --> 11:44.631
You know I could have let
you borrow my tripod, right?

11:46.701 --> 11:49.502
So, you're just going to sit
there whittling while she's running away.

11:49.903 --> 11:51.605
All I'm saying is we
should have thought it through.

11:51.705 --> 11:53.107
You know, brought
our own supplies.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.442
There's a hundred things
we could have used there.

11:55.542 --> 11:56.944
It's called on-site procurement.

11:57.879 --> 11:59.614
Derek, you play way too
many video games.

12:00.615 --> 12:01.782
I don't know how you're
giving me shit for this.

12:03.017 --> 12:04.385
You're whole plan was for them
to see the flashing lights

12:05.320 --> 12:05.586
from the car and just
come running out.

12:06.454 --> 12:06.754
No, no.
I had a fallback plan.

12:07.122 --> 12:07.788
Which was?

12:08.489 --> 12:09.091
It was, to turn the water off.

12:10.158 --> 12:11.059
Maybe either come out to
fix it or to take a piss.

12:11.993 --> 12:14.161
- Uh, what if they pissed in the sink?
- Ew.

12:15.029 --> 12:16.797
When were you
planning on telling us this?

12:17.064 --> 12:19.800
He wasn't. He thinks he's some
kind of eighth dimensional

12:19.901 --> 12:21.036
chess player who's
smarter than us.

12:22.137 --> 12:24.438
Okay. All right, you've got
a plan for everything.

12:24.538 --> 12:26.108
I like to just use what's
ready and available?

12:26.642 --> 12:29.778
Whatever happened to just
good old choking somebody?

12:29.878 --> 12:32.047
You can strangle someone
if it's part of the plan.

12:32.148 --> 12:35.051
Derek could strangle half the people
in this school. Couldn't you, baby?

12:35.250 --> 12:37.618
- Thank you, Sweetie.
- I'm sure he could. Okay?

12:37.719 --> 12:39.855
But if we don't plan, we
can't come to school anymore.

12:40.656 --> 12:42.524
If we don't plan, we're
going to end up in jail.

12:42.791 --> 12:43.659
Or worse.

12:44.793 --> 12:46.561
Try that choking
idea on you, huh?

12:48.530 --> 12:50.099
Awesome, you're stronger
than me.

12:50.833 --> 12:51.701
Fucking Neanderthal.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.104
Okay. If we want to bring an
axe, we have to plan for it.

12:55.838 --> 12:57.473
If we fail to plan,
plan to fail.

12:58.574 --> 13:00.076
Okay, so why don't we just
make a supply checklist?

13:00.542 --> 13:01.543
No!

13:01.643 --> 13:02.711
No more checklists!

13:02.812 --> 13:03.980
No more prepping. Planning!

13:04.080 --> 13:05.682
Got enough homework as it is.

13:05.982 --> 13:08.017
This is supposed to
be fun, not school.

13:10.186 --> 13:11.054
All right?

13:11.154 --> 13:12.088
Okay.

13:28.238 --> 13:30.174
Ugh. Jesus.

13:32.242 --> 13:33.210
Who called this in?

13:34.311 --> 13:35.846
Paper got an anonymous tip.

13:36.814 --> 13:37.748
They called us.

13:39.150 --> 13:41.186
They said they'll do whatever
they can to help us catch the guy.

13:42.053 --> 13:43.755
Yeah, well that would be
a first, wouldn't it.

13:55.834 --> 13:59.137
- You've been on the force, what, six years, Mike?
- Be six in January.

13:59.871 --> 14:02.107
And how many homicides we had
in the county before this year?

14:03.309 --> 14:04.876
Just the Nicholson thing.

14:06.578 --> 14:07.645
Yeah, that was a rough one.

14:08.613 --> 14:09.581
And how many this year?

14:10.082 --> 14:10.950
Three.

14:11.582 --> 14:12.250
Three?

14:13.051 --> 14:14.285
You think they're connected?

14:19.358 --> 14:20.226
Where's the other body?

14:34.774 --> 14:37.743
<i>Captain John Mason
approaches the village.</i>

14:39.045 --> 14:41.947
Somewhere near the Mystic River.
He doesn't have enough men

14:42.048 --> 14:45.551
to get through the walls, so he
lights the whole thing on fire,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.821
gives the order to his
men to shoot anyone

14:48.922 --> 14:49.956
who tries to escape...

14:50.857 --> 14:53.160
Man, what kind of sicko
would set someone on fire?

14:53.927 --> 14:55.962
Somewhere between four
and 700 Pequods

14:56.063 --> 14:57.331
are killed, mostly
women and children.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.301
Now, where I'd like to
open this up to you guys,

15:01.401 --> 15:03.003
is how Mason,

15:03.103 --> 15:04.738
or any of the other English
colonies for that matter,

15:04.838 --> 15:08.241
how they justify something
like this.

15:11.044 --> 15:11.912
Mr. Gordon?

15:14.714 --> 15:15.883
I mean, what's there to justify?

15:17.018 --> 15:18.152
You mess with the best you
die like the rest, right?

15:19.954 --> 15:21.622
Hmm. Ah, well.

15:22.290 --> 15:24.358
Yeah, that's certainly
a popular sentiment

15:24.459 --> 15:26.260
on this countries T-shirts
and bumper stickers but,

15:26.360 --> 15:29.897
um, but we are talking
about a massacre

15:29.997 --> 15:31.332
of innocent people
here, Mr. Gordon.

15:32.834 --> 15:34.235
What is the moral argument here?

15:35.670 --> 15:36.737
Yeah, the other Mister Gordon.

15:37.672 --> 15:39.640
Well, the moral argument
is an illusion.

15:40.142 --> 15:42.144
The idea that there's
some absolute law made

15:42.811 --> 15:44.780
by the weak to protect
themselves.

15:47.748 --> 15:50.885
You've been
reading Nietzsche, Ian.

15:53.855 --> 15:56.325
You should watch out,
adolescent testosterone

15:56.425 --> 15:59.061
and Nietzsche is
a pretty dangerous combination.

16:00.929 --> 16:02.865
The people we are
talking about here

16:02.965 --> 16:05.033
were so devoted to their
interpretation of

16:05.134 --> 16:07.836
Christianity that they are
willing to go across the

16:07.937 --> 16:09.939
ocean to live it out.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.842
Now how can they possibly
justify something like this?

16:15.144 --> 16:16.678
Because they're Christian.

16:18.780 --> 16:19.648
Yeah.

16:20.316 --> 16:22.018
But you can do better than that.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.054
That's the whole Calvinist
worldview.

16:26.156 --> 16:28.691
Some people are saved,
and others are damned,

16:28.958 --> 16:30.226
and it's already decided.

16:31.228 --> 16:32.862
And clearly the Pequods
aren't saved,

16:32.962 --> 16:34.797
since they're not living
like Puritans,

16:34.898 --> 16:37.300
so it doesn't matter
what you do to them.

16:39.402 --> 16:40.403
Yeah. Interesting argument.

16:41.371 --> 16:45.376
The point is, that the
Calvinist worldview

16:45.476 --> 16:50.080
gives a lot of latitude to
do horrible, horrible things.

16:51.916 --> 16:53.317
What are some of those...

17:05.095 --> 17:06.696
Horrible, horrible
things tomorrow.

17:06.797 --> 17:08.999
Um, Jamestown papers on my desk.

17:15.307 --> 17:16.174
Okay, here we go.

17:16.974 --> 17:19.077
"Two Dead in Grand
Lake Massacre."

17:20.145 --> 17:21.846
Two does not count
as a massacre.

17:21.946 --> 17:22.814
I know, right?

17:24.048 --> 17:27.419
"The bodies of Ray Hiestand and
Gina Tonali were discovered

17:27.519 --> 17:30.721
early this morning by park
rangers at a remote cabin."

17:31.423 --> 17:33.191
Pre-marital is not
the Lord's way.

17:34.259 --> 17:36.194
- Seriously?
- Maybe she didn't change her name.

17:38.264 --> 17:41.766
No, here it is. "Friends said the two
had been together for three years."

17:41.866 --> 17:44.437
Blah blah blah, "...police wouldn't
release details of the murders.

17:44.971 --> 17:46.138
Ms. Tonali..."

17:52.178 --> 17:53.044
What?

17:53.878 --> 17:55.780
"Ms. Tonali recently
told her friends

17:55.881 --> 17:57.350
she was expecting
their first child."

17:59.919 --> 18:02.021
So?

18:02.422 --> 18:05.024
Pfft. I mean, it's not like
we could have saved her.

18:05.359 --> 18:08.095
That was one of our rules right
from the beginning, no kids.

18:09.196 --> 18:10.430
She wasn't even showing.

18:11.030 --> 18:12.365
It was a bunch of cells.

18:12.465 --> 18:14.367
Not like we killed
a squalling infant.

18:17.136 --> 18:18.305
No, I know. You're right.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.040
You're totally right.

18:21.341 --> 18:23.343
Great. So, Friday?

18:24.578 --> 18:25.445
What's Friday?

18:26.446 --> 18:29.283
I was thinking some kind
of late night activity.

18:30.117 --> 18:30.984
You know.

18:31.352 --> 18:33.154
Wha... like, another one?

18:34.155 --> 18:35.022
Why Friday?

18:35.989 --> 18:36.857
It's Halloween.

18:40.193 --> 18:44.064
Oh, we're serious?
Doesn't that seem...

18:44.164 --> 18:47.135
I thought the whole point was that it's
supposed to be, you know, a random act.

18:47.235 --> 18:49.037
Halloween seems to be
a little clichéd.

18:49.137 --> 18:51.205
It's not clichéd, it's classic.

18:52.373 --> 18:54.175
It's our first Halloween
since we started.

18:54.876 --> 18:55.977
We can't just sit at home.

18:56.578 --> 18:57.845
That is so not a good idea.

18:57.945 --> 18:58.846
We should be lying low.

18:59.714 --> 19:00.847
Isn't that one of
our rules, though?

19:01.449 --> 19:02.350
No patterns?

19:02.583 --> 19:03.885
I don't see how that fits.

19:04.919 --> 19:08.056
We waited, what, six
weeks before the last one?

19:08.457 --> 19:09.857
Seven weeks before that.

19:10.426 --> 19:13.262
Six weeks before that.
That's a pattern.

19:13.629 --> 19:15.864
Okay, well, why don't
we wait longer?

19:16.532 --> 19:17.866
Like, maybe a few months?

19:18.334 --> 19:19.201
A few months?

19:20.336 --> 19:22.937
Well, ugh, I just got to get my
applications in soon.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.273
Then we're heading
into midterms.

19:24.373 --> 19:25.907
Since when do you have
to worry about midterms?

19:26.175 --> 19:27.309
It just seems like a lot.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.547
And, and, and now, killing that kid,
I get it, just a bunch of cells but...

19:32.448 --> 19:34.850
I don't know, maybe it will make the
police look into it a little harder.

19:36.085 --> 19:37.387
I say we cool it for a bit.

19:38.488 --> 19:39.955
Ugh. So what?

19:40.156 --> 19:41.391
You can go to parties,
get drunk.

19:41.491 --> 19:42.359
Is that it?

19:42.459 --> 19:43.960
No, that's not it at all.

19:45.328 --> 19:47.564
But maybe we should.
Maybe we should go to parties. Act normal.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.264
Hey, how about this?

19:50.132 --> 19:52.402
We do this one and then
nothing until New Year's.

19:53.436 --> 19:56.506
Your applications can
wait a week, right?

19:59.442 --> 20:00.477
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

20:01.111 --> 20:02.212
Yes.

20:02.312 --> 20:03.213
All right. If everything,

20:04.180 --> 20:05.416
if everything
works out, we move forward.

20:05.516 --> 20:07.084
If it doesn't, we scrap it.

20:08.018 --> 20:09.253
- Deal?
- Deal.

20:10.721 --> 20:11.588
Deal.

21:48.387 --> 21:49.255
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:49.556 --> 21:50.457
Coming with us?

21:50.557 --> 21:51.725
I think it's just the two of us.

21:51.825 --> 21:53.126
Derek couldn't get
out of practice.

21:53.427 --> 21:54.294
What about Miriam?

21:54.628 --> 21:55.662
Miriam is with Layla.

21:56.463 --> 21:58.666
As usual. All right.
Let's go then.

22:03.170 --> 22:04.037
Oh, man.

22:04.739 --> 22:06.508
- Hey, Al.
- Hey, Mike.

22:07.642 --> 22:09.010
They ran the story.

22:09.110 --> 22:10.378
She was pregnant.

22:11.311 --> 22:14.147
- Goddamn.
- Fucking animal.

22:14.749 --> 22:17.084
Got to call forensic and make sure they
keep their mouths shut on this one.

22:17.184 --> 22:19.521
I'm getting tired of reading about
this shit in the fucking newspapers.

22:22.690 --> 22:24.626
- What have you got?
- Got the files on Jackson County.

22:25.426 --> 22:26.294
Like pulling teeth.

22:26.595 --> 22:27.796
Yeah. Some things never change.

22:33.168 --> 22:35.670
Okay, looks like we have one
the same night it was closed.

22:36.404 --> 22:37.773
Got a twofer, looks like
a meth deal gone bad

22:37.873 --> 22:39.274
by the looks of things.

22:41.810 --> 22:43.077
Hang on, four others.

22:44.747 --> 22:47.283
- That seem high to you?
- Yep. And for them.

22:47.383 --> 22:49.084
They don't have the slightest
idea where to start.

22:49.518 --> 22:51.453
No witnesses. No suspects.

22:51.554 --> 22:52.454
No connections.

22:52.555 --> 22:53.557
Yeah. Just like us.

22:55.324 --> 22:56.191
What you got there?

22:57.494 --> 22:58.694
Winchester back in June.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.162
Guy had this photo
emailed to him

23:00.262 --> 23:01.297
right around the time of death.

23:05.334 --> 23:06.201
Hang on.

23:12.409 --> 23:13.476
Woman last night.

23:14.578 --> 23:16.246
Emailed that photograph
right before she was killed.

23:22.686 --> 23:23.587
You thinking what I'm thinking?

23:24.521 --> 23:26.156
What you don't get
many pictures like that

23:26.256 --> 23:27.324
emailed to you
from unknown senders?

23:27.724 --> 23:29.426
Call the DA, get that
warrant we need.

23:29.759 --> 23:31.294
It's time we re-open
these cases.

23:33.296 --> 23:35.165
- I'll look into it.
- Let me know.

23:38.536 --> 23:39.437
Forensics, please.

24:31.290 --> 24:34.427
Uh, how's the biology project
with you and Miriam coming along?

24:34.526 --> 24:37.429
It's not coming along and
I'm doing it by myself.

24:37.529 --> 24:40.332
Miriam and Layla are pairing up.

24:40.432 --> 24:43.603
Wow. Really losing your number
one spot to the girls' team, huh?

24:44.704 --> 24:46.439
- It's not that.
- Really?

24:46.539 --> 24:48.775
Okay, I just... she spends
so much time with her

24:48.875 --> 24:50.811
lately and I feel like it's not

24:50.911 --> 24:52.245
in line with what we're doing.

24:53.446 --> 24:54.548
You think she's going to snitch?

24:55.649 --> 24:58.584
No, no.
It, I, I know she wouldn't.

24:58.685 --> 25:01.621
I just, I don't want
her to slip up.

25:10.497 --> 25:11.365
This one's fine.

25:12.566 --> 25:13.867
There's a gun rack on
the four by four.

25:15.836 --> 25:16.938
There. Security system.

25:17.939 --> 25:19.841
Those signs are all fake.

25:19.941 --> 25:20.775
It's too close
to the road.

25:28.382 --> 25:29.283
What about this one?

25:30.384 --> 25:31.251
Hmm.

25:34.388 --> 25:35.255
Let's see.

25:39.060 --> 25:41.262
Ma is in the garden
raking leaves.

25:43.732 --> 25:45.300
Pa is chopping wood.

25:45.901 --> 25:46.768
Shit.

25:47.702 --> 25:48.603
What?

25:49.604 --> 25:50.739
Look at him. He looks
like fucking psychopath.

25:53.675 --> 25:54.909
Okay. You want to move on then?

25:55.010 --> 25:55.844
No, fuck that.

25:56.912 --> 25:58.413
There's not enough room in
this town for all of us.

26:04.053 --> 26:04.920
What now?

26:05.554 --> 26:06.455
Let's go play some pool.

26:06.722 --> 26:08.424
All right, let's go get Derek.

26:12.995 --> 26:16.031
- I don't get why we couldn't finish the game.
- Well, it's almost two

26:16.132 --> 26:17.900
and we have school
tomorrow, Derek.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.735
Ugh, I just think
you don't like to lose.

26:20.436 --> 26:21.370
Okay. Whatever.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.414
- Come on.
- What's the rush?

26:31.882 --> 26:33.483
I have to do that
paper for Vollman.

26:33.583 --> 26:35.284
Six pages on the
Jamestown colony.

26:35.384 --> 26:36.552
You haven't done that yet?

26:37.087 --> 26:38.287
I have to do footnotes.

26:38.989 --> 26:39.890
Slacker.

26:40.690 --> 26:42.826
- All right.
- I'll see you later.

26:42.926 --> 26:44.394
- Yeah. Good night, baby.
- Bye.

26:48.966 --> 26:51.568
Just, I figure would it kill you

26:51.668 --> 26:52.804
to maybe not kiss her
in front of me?

26:52.904 --> 26:53.871
I don't know? Maybe just...

26:54.404 --> 26:55.506
- Okay.
- Whatever.

26:57.775 --> 26:58.642
Shit.

27:09.153 --> 27:10.021
Get over here.

27:12.456 --> 27:13.324
Hi, Dad.

27:15.893 --> 27:17.562
That was Jenny's
car I just saw, right?

27:18.496 --> 27:21.967
Well, she, uh, just finished,
uh, family dinner thing and uh,

27:23.034 --> 27:24.068
she was just coming over
to grab some calc notes.

27:26.171 --> 27:28.974
Yeah, I get it. Both of you,
fully clothed two o'clock in the morning.

27:31.009 --> 27:32.577
Guys, look, I know
I drive you crazy

27:32.678 --> 27:34.046
busting your balls like this,

27:36.415 --> 27:38.483
but I love you. Just trying to keep
you out of trouble, that's all.

27:38.584 --> 27:40.986
Next year you're going to be in
college doing God knows what,

27:41.820 --> 27:43.923
'til then how about we
follow some rules, huh?

27:45.859 --> 27:46.758
Yes, sir.

27:48.160 --> 27:51.096
Okay get over here. Give your old
man a hug. It's two in the morning,

27:51.196 --> 27:53.866
2:30 for Christ's sake
on a school night.

27:53.966 --> 27:54.933
Go to bed.

27:55.034 --> 27:56.035
- Get out of here.
- All right.

28:01.040 --> 28:01.875
Fuck.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.030
Oh. Sorry, Mr. Vollman.
I didn't realize you were in here.

28:23.130 --> 28:24.865
Today is Tuesday, isn't it?

28:26.834 --> 28:28.535
Yeah and on a Tuesday
you have a,

28:28.636 --> 28:29.904
you have a Planning
Committee meeting in here.

28:31.238 --> 28:34.008
Yeah, but um, we can find somewhere else.
It's not a problem.

28:34.109 --> 28:35.608
No, no, no, no. Don't worry.

28:36.542 --> 28:38.178
I can go eat lunch in my car.

28:40.714 --> 28:41.582
Okay.

28:44.718 --> 28:46.453
- Hey, Mr. Vollman.
- Hi, Jenny.

28:48.156 --> 28:51.860
Oh, Ian, I uh, I have
something for you.

28:52.794 --> 28:53.662
What's this?

28:54.461 --> 28:57.499
Think of it as the
anti-Nietzsche.

28:59.234 --> 29:01.635
Okay, now I know what it's like
being a smart teenage kid, okay.

29:01.735 --> 29:04.139
If you could have seen
me 10 years ago,

29:05.140 --> 29:07.909
dressed all in black,
trying to liberate myself

29:08.009 --> 29:10.445
from the illusion that life
has any meaning whatsoever.

29:12.214 --> 29:16.052
I guess all I'm trying to say is I think it's
important that you establish an opposition,

29:16.152 --> 29:19.188
a dialogue and I think
this could do just that.

29:22.024 --> 29:24.025
Maybe you read it, and it changes
the way you look at the world.

29:24.125 --> 29:26.962
Or maybe you put it into your
backpack and forget all about it.

29:27.896 --> 29:29.464
So it goes. Okay?

29:33.703 --> 29:34.904
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:36.105 --> 29:38.240
Hey, Ian. Could I borrow that
when you're done with it?

29:38.342 --> 29:39.842
Oh, I... I'm done.

29:46.749 --> 29:47.917
- Good to go?
- Yeah.

29:48.184 --> 29:51.654
All right.
One story house with a basement.

29:52.121 --> 29:54.790
There's a garage about
ten feet away and

29:55.125 --> 29:56.927
a barn about 20 feet past that.

29:57.593 --> 29:59.863
Three buildings?
That's a lot to control.

29:59.963 --> 30:01.598
Yeah. We'll have to keep
them in the house.

30:01.698 --> 30:03.567
What if they make a run for it?

30:03.667 --> 30:05.202
I think I can outrun
a senior citizen.

30:05.802 --> 30:06.737
He's 50.

30:07.004 --> 30:08.605
Then we'll keep them fenced in.

30:09.173 --> 30:11.775
- What next?
- They have a front door

30:11.875 --> 30:14.945
that they keep unlocked
until bedtime, around 11.

30:15.245 --> 30:17.247
And side door, not a problem.

30:17.348 --> 30:18.181
Cheap lock.

30:19.983 --> 30:20.851
Where'd you get those?

30:22.652 --> 30:24.022
I went back after I
dropped you at home.

30:24.355 --> 30:26.924
- Stuck around until about three.
- A.M.?

30:27.358 --> 30:31.596
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sure dad would leave the country for months on end.

30:32.063 --> 30:33.097
Yeah.

30:33.198 --> 30:34.265
Having a dad who can't stand

30:34.365 --> 30:35.933
to be around me totally rules.

30:36.968 --> 30:38.069
Grass is greener.

30:40.371 --> 30:43.074
Their names are Dave and
Katherine Lauderback.

30:43.608 --> 30:45.843
Owe 60 bucks on a credit card,
which isn't getting paid

30:46.311 --> 30:49.314
and they have a friend in
Midland with a new grandkid.

30:49.882 --> 30:50.748
That's all I got.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.252
We need the floor plans.

30:53.852 --> 30:54.520
Who's free after school?

30:55.254 --> 30:56.822
I can probably
get out of band.

30:56.922 --> 30:58.856
Great, then we'll
head to City Hall.

30:58.956 --> 31:00.192
As long as I'm back
before dinner.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.094
- Sounds good.
- Sounds like a plan.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.735
What are you gonna tell your parents
when they ask what you've got there?

31:10.302 --> 31:12.071
Uh, sociology.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.039
A visual history of the
suffragette movement.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.043
Are you actually
doing that in sociology?

31:17.143 --> 31:17.977
Yeah, of course.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.980
Every good lie has
at least 95% truth.

31:25.784 --> 31:28.720
Um, do you want to come in
for dinner tonight

31:29.055 --> 31:31.057
or even just hang out
for a few minutes?

31:34.994 --> 31:36.863
Nah, your parents are too nice.

31:36.963 --> 31:38.031
It kind of freaks me out.

31:39.699 --> 31:40.367
Suit yourself.

31:41.368 --> 31:42.236
Good night.

32:07.295 --> 32:08.163
Hey, monkey.

32:08.829 --> 32:10.865
Hey, Dad. What's that?

32:11.731 --> 32:14.869
Oh, um, it's white chili with
enough cheese to kill a horse.

32:15.336 --> 32:16.337
What's in the tube?

32:18.072 --> 32:20.408
Just a visual history of
the suffragette movement.

32:20.808 --> 32:21.876
Oh. Can we see?

32:25.280 --> 32:28.383
It's not ready yet. But, ah,
I'm just going to drop my stuff

32:28.483 --> 32:29.751
upstairs and then
I'll be right back down.

32:30.152 --> 32:31.019
Yeah.

32:33.922 --> 32:35.257
You make us proud, sweetie.

32:38.193 --> 32:39.060
Was that too much?

32:39.828 --> 32:40.695
Just a little.

32:41.496 --> 32:42.697
Well,
she's a hard worker.

32:43.031 --> 32:44.766
She sure is.

34:29.074 --> 34:31.010
David L. Lauderback, 55.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.344
Married Katherine Sklarski

34:32.445 --> 34:34.112
when they were in
their late 20s.

34:35.179 --> 34:36.915
She doesn't have a record
but he got picked up

34:37.016 --> 34:38.417
for vagrancy when he was 30.

34:38.951 --> 34:39.851
Vagrancy?

34:40.918 --> 34:42.554
I don't know. Hitchhiking,
maybe? It doesn't say.

34:44.188 --> 34:45.391
No weapon permits.

34:47.494 --> 34:50.362
One landline, one cell phone,
in her name.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.498
Got both numbers.

34:51.598 --> 34:53.233
Credit score is good, not great.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.068
That's it?

34:56.101 --> 34:57.203
Yeah, they really
liked to live off the grid.

34:58.037 --> 34:59.204
No, we can do better than that.

35:00.373 --> 35:02.242
He is not on the internet.

35:02.342 --> 35:03.977
She has a Facebook account.

35:04.077 --> 35:06.112
Seven friends, five of
which are relatives.

35:07.147 --> 35:10.116
She likes gardening
and leaves typical

35:10.216 --> 35:12.852
old person comments on her
sister's kid's pictures.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.089
That's pathetic.

35:16.490 --> 35:20.961
- So, what are we going to wear?
- What do you think? Creepy or what?

35:21.295 --> 35:24.130
Is this all right? I'd prefer
something that covers the whole face.

35:25.198 --> 35:27.033
Well, I don't know.

35:27.134 --> 35:28.001
What if we make our masks?

35:29.070 --> 35:33.274
Like, maybe, potato sacks
with eye-holes cut out.

35:33.908 --> 35:35.209
Hmm.
It's been done before.

35:35.910 --> 35:36.977
When has it been done before?

35:38.045 --> 35:39.581
I don't know. In, like,
every slasher movie ever?

35:41.116 --> 35:41.982
Yeah, I guess so.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.954
Guys, what about these?

35:47.054 --> 35:48.322
- Holy shit.
- Jeez.

35:48.956 --> 35:50.425
I used to play
lots of dress up as a kid.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.527
What like animals?

35:52.927 --> 35:53.961
Not just animals.

35:54.061 --> 35:54.895
Look.

35:55.697 --> 35:56.965
Totally creepy, right?

35:57.232 --> 35:58.567
Yeah.
It's a little disconcerting.

35:59.167 --> 36:00.335
Okay.

36:02.337 --> 36:03.439
I don't know.
I've got a bunch of stuff.

36:03.539 --> 36:06.442
Zombies, skulls, sexy ladies...

36:06.709 --> 36:08.077
Sexy ladies?

36:08.344 --> 36:10.479
That's what it
says on the label.

36:10.579 --> 36:11.980
There's no thematic unity.

36:12.547 --> 36:13.582
So?

36:14.082 --> 36:15.117
So, who's going
to be afraid

36:15.217 --> 36:16.885
of four people in
mismatched masks?

36:18.287 --> 36:19.288
I don't know. Why don't we get a
bunch of these and swap them out.

36:19.389 --> 36:21.624
They'll think there's like
20 people hunting them.

36:29.298 --> 36:30.166
I like it.

36:32.736 --> 36:35.138
I don't know.
What about coherence?

36:35.605 --> 36:37.673
Coherence?

36:38.608 --> 36:39.675
Fuck coherence.

36:41.010 --> 36:42.479
It's about motherfucking chaos.

36:43.547 --> 36:44.947
Let's shake some shit up.

38:14.206 --> 38:15.074
Thanks.

38:16.408 --> 38:18.378
- Should I go again, or?
- No need.

38:18.778 --> 38:22.282
Are you sure? I just, I don't know,
I felt like the turns were off and...

38:22.382 --> 38:23.517
It was perfect.

38:38.632 --> 38:40.701
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:42.335 --> 38:43.203
Was that okay?

38:47.275 --> 38:48.142
Yeah.

38:48.242 --> 38:51.212
Um, you just surprised me.

38:53.614 --> 38:54.716
In a good way?

38:56.785 --> 38:59.185
Yeah, in a good way.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.638
- Where's everyone else?
- Derek's in the washroom.

39:17.306 --> 39:18.407
Three guesses where Miriam is.

39:19.508 --> 39:21.443
- With Layla?
- Got it in one.

39:27.316 --> 39:30.352
Hey. Do you mind if I borrow those
notes from Ruas' class today?

39:33.288 --> 39:36.492
- What the hell is that?
- It's nothing, okay? I was, I was going to get rid of it.

39:38.494 --> 39:41.297
It's from the cabin, isn't it? You were
going to put this in Vollman's desk.

39:42.298 --> 39:43.266
I don't know what you're
talking about.

39:43.366 --> 39:45.234
Ian, please.

39:45.335 --> 39:46.201
I'm not stupid.

39:47.169 --> 39:47.837
I know you're trying
to pin this on Vollman.

39:50.607 --> 39:51.674
Okay. Yeah.

39:53.309 --> 39:54.177
It's insurance.

39:55.178 --> 39:57.780
You know, just in case
things don't go to plan.

40:04.788 --> 40:07.391
- What have we got?
- Take a look. Think we got something.

40:07.658 --> 40:11.160
All seven cases but one. Each victim
received a different photograph emailed

40:11.260 --> 40:13.831
to them from an unknown sender.
That's a deliberate pattern, Mikey.

40:15.331 --> 40:16.265
Deliberately obscure.

40:17.300 --> 40:18.602
I mean who takes a picture
of a candy wrapper?

40:21.205 --> 40:21.872
I don't know.

40:23.641 --> 40:25.810
Look, how you getting along with

40:25.910 --> 40:27.846
the warrant from the DA?
We got to start tracing this thing down.

40:28.947 --> 40:30.347
Yeah. I'm working on it.

40:30.448 --> 40:32.350
Okay, good.
Look, I'm going to head out

40:32.450 --> 40:34.218
to the scenes, okay?
Maybe we missed something.

40:35.519 --> 40:37.488
I think this one thinks
he's smarter than us.

40:38.857 --> 40:39.523
Let's prove him wrong, yeah?

40:41.860 --> 40:43.160
- Let me know.
- Will do.

42:34.408 --> 42:36.577
- <i>What have you got?</i>
- <i>DA came through.</i>

42:36.677 --> 42:38.513
<i>All the pictures were
sent from the same IP.</i>

42:39.580 --> 42:42.483
- <i>You got a trace?</i>
- <i>The high school.</i>

42:43.085 --> 42:45.921
<i>We call out to their tech to
see if we can narrow it down.</i>

42:47.422 --> 42:49.058
<i>Yeah, I'm going to go head out.
Take a look around.</i>

42:56.933 --> 42:58.000
So they made their
way to the door.

42:58.801 --> 43:00.335
Derek, you're going to be...

43:02.004 --> 43:04.073
Uh, I will
grab the phone

43:04.941 --> 43:06.009
and I'll toss it to Jenny.

43:06.843 --> 43:10.412
Then Miriam does
her bit and, um,

43:11.381 --> 43:13.383
- and then they turn around and they see us.
- All right.

43:13.583 --> 43:15.585
I end up blocking the kitchen
door here.

43:16.053 --> 43:17.453
Derek,
you're in the living room.

43:24.260 --> 43:29.499
Sorry. Um, I get up, they panic
and they make it to the hallway.

43:29.599 --> 43:30.867
And if they overpower you?

43:31.401 --> 43:34.504
- Then I make a run for it this way.
- Derek?

43:35.573 --> 43:38.442
Ian, we've been over this like a million
times, dude. We get it. We know what...

43:38.542 --> 43:40.444
If they attack Miriam,
where do you go?

43:42.847 --> 43:43.714
I don't know.

43:43.814 --> 43:45.415
Cry and turn myself in?

43:46.549 --> 43:49.086
We'll figure it out,
all right? We're fine.

43:49.720 --> 43:50.921
Come on, it's six.
We got to get out of here.

43:51.589 --> 43:52.556
Yeah, let's go.

43:52.656 --> 43:53.657
We got a lot to do tonight.

43:54.091 --> 43:55.093
I'll pick you guys up at nine?

43:56.594 --> 43:57.996
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44:13.510 --> 44:14.378
Are you okay?

44:14.880 --> 44:16.581
You seem distracted.

44:18.617 --> 44:19.484
I'm fine.

44:21.019 --> 44:22.487
You know that we need
you for this.

44:23.655 --> 44:24.656
Okay, I know that you
got a lot going on,

44:24.756 --> 44:27.425
but this is the last one.

44:27.525 --> 44:28.160
So...

44:30.596 --> 44:31.464
For now.

44:33.865 --> 44:35.967
I think me and you both
know that's not true.

44:36.501 --> 44:37.702
You got better things going on.

44:40.472 --> 44:41.841
It's not like that.

44:41.941 --> 44:42.875
Oh, it is.

44:43.743 --> 44:45.845
It's exactly like that
but it's okay.

44:48.848 --> 44:50.117
I just need you to be focused.

44:51.651 --> 44:52.518
For tonight.

44:56.256 --> 44:57.124
I'll be fine.

45:00.626 --> 45:01.494
I'll be fine.

45:05.132 --> 45:05.999
Okay.

45:07.935 --> 45:08.802
Okay.

46:07.563 --> 46:08.264
<i>Did you find anything?</i>

46:09.731 --> 46:11.166
<i>Yeah. I did.</i>

46:12.267 --> 46:15.804
<i>All of it. Photographs.
All taken here.</i>

46:19.742 --> 46:20.642
<i>Even a laptop.</i>

46:21.510 --> 46:23.246
<i>And he sent the emails
from here.</i>

46:25.281 --> 46:26.883
<i>I think we're going
to get that bastard.</i>

46:28.218 --> 46:29.285
<i>Do you need forensics?</i>

46:31.354 --> 46:32.222
<i>Yeah.</i>

46:33.056 --> 46:33.989
<i>Send them over.</i>

49:35.978 --> 49:37.079
<i>Today,
we'll be looking</i>

49:37.179 --> 49:38.415
<i>at three different properties,</i>

49:38.515 --> 49:40.149
<i>unique design, panoramic view.</i>

49:40.250 --> 49:41.784
Doesn't that look like the place

49:41.884 --> 49:44.753
- where we were with my sister?
- Mmhm.

49:45.187 --> 49:48.123
<i>First off we have a suburban haven
which at first glance may seem simple...</i>

49:48.224 --> 49:52.061
<i>...with a massive wow factor...</i>

49:52.161 --> 49:53.028
Don't worry about it.

49:54.029 --> 49:55.965
We don't have candy.
The kids will go away.

50:02.505 --> 50:03.373
Jesus.

50:17.220 --> 50:18.489
Who's out there?

50:29.601 --> 50:30.901
Must be some kids.

50:42.947 --> 50:44.148
What in the hell?

50:45.417 --> 50:46.285
Hello?

50:47.952 --> 50:48.886
Hello?

51:01.566 --> 51:02.434
Hey!

51:04.469 --> 51:06.071
Who the hell is out there?

51:10.476 --> 51:12.010
Stop messing around!

51:13.413 --> 51:14.980
Get the hell out of here!

51:18.951 --> 51:20.053
You're kidding?

51:24.590 --> 51:25.458
Ugh.

51:26.559 --> 51:28.994
Fine. Yeah. Jesus.

51:32.065 --> 51:34.033
Dave, what?

51:34.133 --> 51:36.402
They say it's probably just
some kids fooling around.

51:38.405 --> 51:40.541
They're going to send
someone over but not

51:40.641 --> 51:42.242
for a couple hours.

51:48.448 --> 51:51.017
I'm going to need
something stronger.

51:51.117 --> 51:53.186
And then you'll be awake all
night tossing and turning.

51:56.123 --> 51:57.857
I'll meet you halfway and
I'll get you more sugar.

51:58.592 --> 52:02.329
- I'm already sweet enough.
- Yes. You are.

52:06.967 --> 52:08.068
Is that the police?

52:28.022 --> 52:28.657
Help me.

52:30.024 --> 52:31.292
Please, help me

52:34.429 --> 52:35.296
Someone's out here.

52:35.996 --> 52:36.998
What is it?

52:43.506 --> 52:44.372
You okay?

52:51.213 --> 52:53.048
Run, run!

53:05.528 --> 53:06.695
Let's go, let's go!

53:09.365 --> 53:11.701
Oh my god!
Who are they?

53:12.636 --> 53:15.138
How do I know? Where's
your cell? Give me a phone.

53:15.238 --> 53:17.441
- It's outside. In the living room on the table.
- Jesus Christ.

53:18.208 --> 53:19.709
Okay. We got to get out
of here. The window.

53:20.577 --> 53:22.378
Okay. Lift me up.

53:26.550 --> 53:27.950
There's more of them out there!

53:36.059 --> 53:37.695
- What are you looking for?
- My father's pistol.

53:37.795 --> 53:39.630
Ugh. I put it in
the barn. It made me nervous!

53:46.436 --> 53:47.437
What are you doing?

54:20.238 --> 54:21.740
I thought you left
your phone in the living room?

54:21.840 --> 54:23.040
That's not my phone.

54:23.141 --> 54:24.409
Oh god. Don't answer!

54:24.510 --> 54:25.644
I'm calling the police.

54:28.113 --> 54:29.114
Press ignore.

54:29.214 --> 54:30.282
No, the other button.

54:30.382 --> 54:31.584
Wh... what? How do I do that?

54:31.684 --> 54:33.050
Okay, give it to me.

54:38.457 --> 54:39.525
What do you want from us?

54:45.698 --> 54:46.566
Dave!

54:49.335 --> 54:50.203
Dave!

54:52.739 --> 54:53.706
Nail it in.

54:56.509 --> 54:57.610
Dave!

54:58.411 --> 55:00.045
What have you done with him?

55:03.283 --> 55:05.151
You cowards!

55:05.251 --> 55:06.419
Shut up!

55:06.519 --> 55:08.822
Dave, Dave!

55:13.794 --> 55:14.795
Dave!

55:23.503 --> 55:24.538
None of these are good.

55:25.773 --> 55:28.309
Jazz, country, blues.
None of these seem ominous enough.

55:28.409 --> 55:31.712
- Not even as, like, ironic counterpoint.
- It's all about juxtaposition.

55:31.812 --> 55:33.747
Whatever you put on is going
to seem creepy and weird.

55:35.149 --> 55:36.383
Hurry up. You're first.

55:42.524 --> 55:43.592
Hey, Bitch!

55:44.892 --> 55:47.094
Baby, you know you
don't have to wear that anymore.

55:47.194 --> 55:50.364
But I like it. Makes me
feel pretty and elegant.

55:51.365 --> 55:52.232
Take it off.

55:53.568 --> 55:55.170
Whatever you say, Missus.

55:56.705 --> 55:58.440
How'd you guys do
in Robinson's class today?

55:59.374 --> 56:00.442
Uhhh.

56:00.542 --> 56:02.510
I think I missed the
one on buoyancy.

56:04.814 --> 56:06.181
Hey!

56:10.185 --> 56:10.852
Pick up six.

56:11.353 --> 56:12.220
Fuck.

56:16.692 --> 56:18.259
Five, six.

56:21.764 --> 56:23.232
Ian, how hard did
you hit that dude?

56:23.899 --> 56:24.767
You sure you didn't kill him?

56:25.668 --> 56:27.303
Last time I checked
he was breathing.

56:29.640 --> 56:32.308
- Is it me?
- Yeah, it's you.

56:32.708 --> 56:35.745
- Hey, uh, Jenny. Pick up two, pick up four.
- Oof.

56:37.313 --> 56:38.214
I could kill you.

56:39.315 --> 56:40.683
I actually think we already
have that covered, so...

56:45.789 --> 56:46.857
Do you guys remember Darby?

56:49.593 --> 56:52.897
She was in our grade two
class, I think

56:53.931 --> 56:57.834
and she always had her
hair in pigtails.

57:03.240 --> 57:04.307
We were so close.

57:06.878 --> 57:08.612
We told each other everything.

57:16.020 --> 57:18.723
And then one day she just
moved away and we never spoke.

57:25.730 --> 57:27.398
And you're telling us this why?

57:32.470 --> 57:33.337
No reason.

58:51.752 --> 58:52.753
Katherine?

58:55.824 --> 58:56.690
Kath?

01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:13.937
Where the hell did you get that?

01:00:14.905 --> 01:00:18.141
Basement. Tried your advice,
improvisation.

01:00:19.643 --> 01:00:20.577
Fuck me.

01:00:21.011 --> 01:00:22.045
Nicely done.

01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:33.457
Third mask?

01:00:33.991 --> 01:00:34.858
Third mask.

01:01:00.718 --> 01:01:01.753
It's stuck.

01:01:01.853 --> 01:01:02.820
Let me try.

01:01:04.156 --> 01:01:07.525
Knock yourself out.
You've got a plan for this, right?

01:01:07.625 --> 01:01:09.560
The plan was that she didn't
get in the first place, Derek!

01:01:09.662 --> 01:01:11.964
Shut up for two minutes.
There's a door back here.

01:01:12.064 --> 01:01:13.732
I think I can kick it through
and one of us can fit.

01:01:14.566 --> 01:01:15.434
<i>Great. Who's going in?</i>

01:01:19.272 --> 01:01:20.906
I'm going in.

01:01:59.813 --> 01:02:01.048
Guys! Car!

01:02:03.784 --> 01:02:05.786
Hurry it up in there.
Someone's coming.

01:02:12.226 --> 01:02:16.197
- Everyone stay put.
- Shit. It's a cop.

01:02:16.897 --> 01:02:18.532
<i>Keep her quiet. I'll handle it.</i>

01:02:18.632 --> 01:02:20.101
Shut her the fuck up!

01:02:21.303 --> 01:02:22.970
<i>Jenny, whatever
you're doing, don't do it!</i>

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:23.904
I said I'll handle this.

01:02:26.674 --> 01:02:27.708
<i>Jenny!</i>

01:02:29.945 --> 01:02:33.147
He gets out, I come up
behind him, take him out.

01:02:33.247 --> 01:02:35.283
No. No, no cops.
You know that, no cops.

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:37.618
No, if were going down for
this, you take him the fuck out...

01:02:37.718 --> 01:02:38.886
She's taking out no one.

01:02:38.987 --> 01:02:39.988
You shut the fuck up.

01:03:05.948 --> 01:03:07.083
Hello? Police officer!

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:21.596
Hello? This is Sheriff Gordon.

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:24.000
What the hell is he doing here?

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:26.235
Anybody there?

01:03:34.078 --> 01:03:34.978
Hello?

01:03:37.881 --> 01:03:39.183
He's heading
to the barn.

01:03:43.221 --> 01:03:44.221
What are you doing?

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:53.230
<i>911.
What is your emergency?</i>

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:54.698
There's somebody in my house.

01:03:56.033 --> 01:03:58.303
I'm at 6378 Route 124.

01:04:00.038 --> 01:04:01.072
I think he has a gun.

01:04:07.045 --> 01:04:08.612
Sorry, guys.
It's him or us.

01:04:09.146 --> 01:04:11.349
<i>No.
Stand the fuck down, Jenny!</i>

01:04:13.952 --> 01:04:14.953
<i>Miriam, keep her quiet!</i>

01:04:28.367 --> 01:04:32.637
<i>All units possible
211 in progress 6378 Route 124.</i>

01:04:32.737 --> 01:04:34.739
Copy that. I'm pretty close
anyway. I'll go check it out.

01:04:34.839 --> 01:04:35.707
There's nothing out here.

01:04:56.896 --> 01:04:58.264
Help! Help!

01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:03.203
Help!

01:05:03.303 --> 01:05:04.670
Help me, please!

01:05:05.438 --> 01:05:07.740
Help!

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.121
We're clear. All good.

01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:22.255
Help, help!

01:05:26.394 --> 01:05:27.361
God, please.

01:05:28.362 --> 01:05:29.729
No, please.

01:05:39.106 --> 01:05:40.107
Put it down.

01:05:42.544 --> 01:05:44.212
You don't have to do this.

01:05:46.047 --> 01:05:47.949
I'll help you.
I'll help you.

01:05:52.086 --> 01:05:52.954
I will.

01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:57.326
You don't have to do this.

01:06:02.264 --> 01:06:03.398
You don't want to do this.

01:06:05.067 --> 01:06:06.201
You don't have to do this.

01:06:08.102 --> 01:06:09.171
It can be over.

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:21.750
I'm sorry.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:24.988
I'm sorry.

01:06:28.024 --> 01:06:29.025
I'm sorry.

01:06:43.373 --> 01:06:44.807
What the fuck was that?

01:06:53.017 --> 01:06:53.884
Miriam!

01:07:03.527 --> 01:07:04.395
Shut her up!

01:07:14.071 --> 01:07:16.140
This wasn't supposed to be here.
It's, it's not registered.

01:07:16.374 --> 01:07:18.543
- Hey man, it wasn't your fault.
- No, it's not

01:07:18.643 --> 01:07:22.913
fucking okay, Derek. For once something
isn't fixable okay, your friend is dying.

01:07:23.013 --> 01:07:25.082
Fucking torch the place.
Burn the evidence.

01:07:25.617 --> 01:07:27.319
No, we're not
leaving her here. Okay?

01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:29.387
What do you want to do?
Take her to the hospital and go to jail...

01:07:30.622 --> 01:07:31.456
- We're not fucking leaving her here, okay?
- Fuck you, Ian!

01:07:32.557 --> 01:07:33.992
Stop arguing, all right?
Help me get her in the car.

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:35.427
You get the fire going.
Let's go!

01:07:46.371 --> 01:07:47.572
Okay, I got her.

01:07:47.672 --> 01:07:49.174
Okay, I'll drive.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:55.614
Come on, Derek! Come on!

01:08:33.553 --> 01:08:36.189
- How is she doing?
- Conscious, but not good.

01:08:37.124 --> 01:08:39.926
- What are we going to do?
- You're going to be all right, Miriam.

01:08:40.026 --> 01:08:41.962
We're going to get you to a hospital.
You're going to be fine.

01:08:42.062 --> 01:08:44.599
- We can't go to a hospital.
- She's going to die if we don't, Derek!

01:08:44.698 --> 01:08:46.332
If we take her there,
we're fucked.

01:08:46.434 --> 01:08:47.602
You don't think the cops will
start asking us questions?

01:08:48.403 --> 01:08:49.537
We can handle the cops.

01:08:49.636 --> 01:08:51.072
No.
It's way too suspicious.

01:08:51.171 --> 01:08:52.006
They'll start poking around.

01:08:53.474 --> 01:08:54.442
We got to do something
about her.

01:08:55.475 --> 01:08:56.576
Do something?
Listen to yourself, okay?

01:08:56.676 --> 01:08:57.978
This is our friend, Derek!

01:08:59.045 --> 01:09:00.279
We can't fucking
take her there, all right?

01:09:01.247 --> 01:09:02.115
What are we going to do?

01:09:02.383 --> 01:09:03.350
You're all right, Miriam.

01:09:04.285 --> 01:09:05.520
We're careful, all right?
We're careful.

01:09:06.921 --> 01:09:08.656
Ian, we can't take her back.
We've got to get rid of her.

01:09:10.158 --> 01:09:11.593
- -I can't
believe you guys are fucking saying this!

01:09:12.728 --> 01:09:14.228
She's still alive! We can
save her! Please, please!

01:09:14.328 --> 01:09:15.162
It's either her or us!

01:09:16.665 --> 01:09:18.100
Look at me.
Look at me, okay? Listen.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:20.468
We've got this, just
chill the fuck out.

01:09:22.036 --> 01:09:24.104
- No, no, no. We can't make that choice!
- She's going to die, Derek!

01:09:25.674 --> 01:09:26.542
Listen to me!

01:09:27.341 --> 01:09:29.143
We can't take her
to the hospital!

01:09:36.318 --> 01:09:38.587
Look at me, Ian. Ian!

01:09:39.354 --> 01:09:40.890
Do you want to spend the
rest of your life in jail?

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.627
Guys!

01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:48.397
It's too late. She's gone.

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.036
Fuck! Fuck, fuck!

01:10:08.618 --> 01:10:09.486
Now what?

01:10:12.255 --> 01:10:15.024
- Ian!
- We could stage a robbery and then kill her.

01:10:15.258 --> 01:10:16.426
It wouldn't be perfect
but her dad

01:10:16.526 --> 01:10:17.761
keeps a shotgun in the study.

01:10:22.233 --> 01:10:23.734
No. Slugs are way too
much of a mess.

01:10:24.568 --> 01:10:26.237
Derek, we can do this!

01:10:26.337 --> 01:10:28.773
We have about three hours
before her blood starts pooling.

01:10:31.375 --> 01:10:32.710
Okay, okay.

01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:33.677
This might work.

01:10:33.777 --> 01:10:35.479
What are we talking about?

01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:37.314
Her parents will hear us.
They'll know.

01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:40.751
No, they won't.

01:10:41.652 --> 01:10:43.655
We sneak in, get Miriam
into her bedroom,

01:10:43.855 --> 01:10:45.524
shoot her, steal a bunch of shit

01:10:45.624 --> 01:10:46.758
then get the hell out of there.

01:10:50.362 --> 01:10:53.365
Yeah, dispatch, that
211 was a prank call.

01:10:54.165 --> 01:10:55.500
That lady was not happy about me

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.735
waking her up at this
time of night.

01:10:56.835 --> 01:10:58.102
<i>Nobody
appreciates us.</i>

01:10:58.202 --> 01:10:59.336
<i>Why don't you head on back?</i>

01:10:59.437 --> 01:11:00.271
Will do.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.775
Dispatch, we got a fire
at the Lauderback place.

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:06.711
Get me fire out there
right now, god damn it! Shit.

01:11:11.784 --> 01:11:12.718
Yeah, I got it.

01:11:20.559 --> 01:11:22.561
- Watch your step!
- Wait, why not just kill her parents?

01:11:22.661 --> 01:11:23.495
Problem solved.

01:11:24.329 --> 01:11:25.297
No, we're not killing them.

01:11:25.665 --> 01:11:26.599
I got her keys.

01:11:27.767 --> 01:11:28.534
Okay, me and Jenny are
going to take care of her.

01:11:29.569 --> 01:11:30.770
- What?
- You're staying out here. All right?

01:11:31.837 --> 01:11:32.438
I don't want to wait out here.
It's fucking cold!

01:11:33.439 --> 01:11:33.472
You're fucking staying
out here, Derek. Okay?

01:11:33.907 --> 01:11:34.607
You're lookout.

01:11:35.241 --> 01:11:36.777
- Take her.
- I got her.

01:11:38.679 --> 01:11:39.813
Just stick to the plan.

01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:15.515
Should we undress her?

01:12:15.883 --> 01:12:17.585
I'll do it. Go get the gun.

01:12:36.304 --> 01:12:38.239
- I think we have a problem.
- What?

01:12:38.339 --> 01:12:40.208
There's no exit wound.
The bullet's still in there.

01:12:43.511 --> 01:12:46.448
This doesn't work with another bullet
in there. We have to get it out.

01:12:55.924 --> 01:12:57.358
We need to extract it.

01:12:57.893 --> 01:12:59.193
Do you want me to do it?

01:12:59.995 --> 01:13:01.563
No, I'll do it. You just...

01:13:03.065 --> 01:13:06.201
You get rid of the bloody clothes.
Okay? Mess some stuff up downstairs.

01:13:06.301 --> 01:13:07.636
I don't know, maybe make, make
the robbery look convincing.

01:13:07.937 --> 01:13:10.305
And then, go tell Derek
to pull the car up.

01:14:30.923 --> 01:14:31.790
Derek?

01:14:32.991 --> 01:14:34.025
What are you doing here?

01:14:35.527 --> 01:14:36.995
Is everything okay?

01:14:41.666 --> 01:14:43.268
You okay, Derek?

01:14:45.337 --> 01:14:46.271
Is everything all right?

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:49.342
What's going on, man?

01:14:52.612 --> 01:14:53.679
Are you good?

01:15:12.431 --> 01:15:13.734
Kirk! Honey!

01:15:14.735 --> 01:15:15.769
Stay there!

01:15:22.475 --> 01:15:23.710
Oh, my god!

01:15:25.045 --> 01:15:25.913
Derek?

01:15:28.982 --> 01:15:30.818
Jenny? Jenny, what's going on?

01:15:35.089 --> 01:15:36.356
Oh, baby.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.627
Derek!

01:15:40.829 --> 01:15:41.896
Go take care of him!

01:15:59.747 --> 01:16:01.749
Ian, what are you doing?

01:16:02.785 --> 01:16:04.653
You weren't supposed to be
involved in this, Mr. Randall.

01:16:08.756 --> 01:16:11.025
Ian, this isn't you.

01:16:11.793 --> 01:16:14.462
You don't know who I am.
You don't know anything about me.

01:16:15.097 --> 01:16:17.766
You don't know what I'm capable of. You
don't even know who your own daughter was.

01:16:19.034 --> 01:16:20.736
Ian, don't do this.

01:16:22.538 --> 01:16:24.607
- Stop saying my name!
- Ian!

01:16:38.554 --> 01:16:39.421
Derek?

01:16:42.524 --> 01:16:43.392
What happened?

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:45.595
What happened, Jenny?

01:16:45.929 --> 01:16:46.963
What happened?

01:16:48.832 --> 01:16:49.900
What happened to him?

01:16:52.002 --> 01:16:53.004
Derek's dead.

01:17:01.511 --> 01:17:03.113
We are done. This is done.

01:17:03.214 --> 01:17:05.149
Ian, I need you to get
it together right now.

01:17:05.249 --> 01:17:07.118
We have an insurance
plan, remember?

01:17:07.218 --> 01:17:09.020
Put this on Vollman just
like we planned.

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.955
We have a plan?
Jenny, the plan went to shit.

01:17:11.055 --> 01:17:13.457
How are we going to put this on
Vollman, if Vollman's not here?

01:17:13.557 --> 01:17:15.026
- He'll be here!
- He'll be here.

01:17:15.826 --> 01:17:17.461
How's he going to be
here at this time, Jenny?

01:17:17.561 --> 01:17:19.164
- He'll be here.
- Oh?

01:17:20.965 --> 01:17:22.565
I texted him from
Miriam's phone.

01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:23.868
He'll be here.

01:17:24.969 --> 01:17:26.037
Trust me.

01:17:30.175 --> 01:17:31.876
Take care of her.

01:17:36.547 --> 01:17:38.183
Finish her off.
I'll start clean-up.

01:17:38.784 --> 01:17:41.687
Yeah. No, no, no! No, no, no, no.
Don't do this!

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:42.921
It's Miriam's mom.

01:17:44.555 --> 01:17:47.159
- Please don't do this, no!
- How does this work if she's still alive?

01:17:49.694 --> 01:17:50.528
It doesn't.

01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:53.665
- But the plan doesn't work.
- Ian,

01:17:54.533 --> 01:17:56.635
she's no different
than any of the others.

01:17:59.671 --> 01:18:01.107
- Come on.
- Please!

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.976
We're running
out of time. Come on.

01:18:07.679 --> 01:18:08.714
I, I can't do it.

01:18:10.249 --> 01:18:11.650
- I can't do it.
- Ian!

01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:13.219
I can't lie to my Dad.

01:18:13.319 --> 01:18:15.021
Not about Derek, he'll know.

01:18:15.554 --> 01:18:16.222
No.

01:18:17.657 --> 01:18:20.526
It doesn't work.
It doesn't work.

01:18:20.626 --> 01:18:21.828
You can't lie to your dad?

01:18:23.029 --> 01:18:23.930
It doesn't work.

01:18:27.334 --> 01:18:28.836
It's not going to work, Jenny.

01:18:29.303 --> 01:18:30.738
I think it will.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.174
No, no, no, no!

01:18:39.213 --> 01:18:42.548
Jenny? Okay, Jenny? Jenny!

01:18:43.649 --> 01:18:45.819
Jenny, Jen, Jen. Jenny,
I don't know what's happening

01:18:45.919 --> 01:18:47.187
but you don't have to do this.

01:18:47.287 --> 01:18:49.257
It's over, okay?
They're all gone.

01:18:49.357 --> 01:18:51.892
You don't have to do this!
It's done!

01:18:51.992 --> 01:18:53.560
Honey, I'm your best
friend's mom!

01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:55.295
- You don't want to do this!
- No!

01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:11.046
Hey, baby.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:13.548
You okay?

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.673
<i>We have a report
of shots fired at 43 Whitaker.</i>

01:20:12.175 --> 01:20:14.077
Dispatch, confirm that
address, please.

01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:16.146
<i>43 Whitaker.</i>

01:20:18.782 --> 01:20:19.783
Jesus Christ.

01:20:41.405 --> 01:20:42.706
Hello?

01:20:50.148 --> 01:20:51.015
Uh.

01:20:53.952 --> 01:20:54.819
Hello?

01:21:10.903 --> 01:21:11.770
Mr. Vollman.

01:21:14.507 --> 01:21:17.443
Um, Jenny, um, let's just
put the gun down. Okay?

01:21:20.745 --> 01:21:23.415
Where's, um, where's Miriam,
Jenny? Is someone hurt?

01:21:26.351 --> 01:21:27.219
Jenny, are you okay?

01:21:29.054 --> 01:21:29.922
I killed him.

01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:33.026
Is someone hurt?

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:36.196
- -Jenny,
I'm just going to take this.

01:21:40.099 --> 01:21:43.036
I just need you to
give me the gun.

01:21:45.104 --> 01:21:45.971
Drop the gun!

01:21:59.587 --> 01:22:00.421
Shh, shh.

01:22:01.355 --> 01:22:02.223
It's okay.

01:23:00.382 --> 01:23:01.783
I didn't know what to do.

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:05.954
I could have stopped it.

01:23:08.391 --> 01:23:09.458
I could have stopped him.

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.295
I'm so sorry.

01:23:37.087 --> 01:23:38.522
Hey, you don't want
to go in there.

01:23:40.357 --> 01:23:41.325
What are you talking about?

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:43.327
Alan!

01:26:07.274 --> 01:26:12.274
