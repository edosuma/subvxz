01:12.615 --> 01:17.454
In the beginning, God
created the heaven and the Earth.

01:17.746 --> 01:20.874
And the Earth was
without form, and void.

01:35.305 --> 01:38.141
This is the planet Earth,
newly born,

01:38.224 --> 01:40.435
and cooling rapidly
from a temperature

01:40.518 --> 01:43.354
of 6,000 degrees
to a few hundred

01:43.438 --> 01:45.982
in less than
five billion years.

01:46.566 --> 01:51.279
The heat rises, meets the
atmosphere, the clouds form,

01:51.362 --> 01:56.367
and rain pours down upon the hardening
surface for countless centuries.

01:57.035 --> 02:02.791
The restless seas rise, find
boundaries, are contained.

02:03.792 --> 02:08.545
Now, in their warm depths,
the miracle of life begins.

02:09.297 --> 02:11.174
In infinite variety,

02:11.257 --> 02:15.970
living things appear, and
change, and reach the land,

02:16.721 --> 02:18.973
leaving a record
of their coming,

02:19.057 --> 02:23.394
of their struggle to survive,
and of their eventual end.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.856
The record of life is
written on the land,

02:27.315 --> 02:29.734
where 15 million years later,

02:30.235 --> 02:33.029
in the upper reaches
of the Amazon,

02:33.112 --> 02:35.907
man is still trying to read it.

02:37.200 --> 02:41.079
Tomas! Tomas! Tomas!

02:48.920 --> 02:50.380
Please.

02:57.637 --> 02:59.222
What that is, Dr. Maia?

02:59.305 --> 03:00.849
I don't know, Luis.

03:00.932 --> 03:03.226
I have never seen
anything like this before.

03:03.309 --> 03:05.520
It's important?

03:05.603 --> 03:09.440
Yes, I think it is,
very important.

03:12.694 --> 03:16.364
We will take one more picture.
Then we will dig it out.

03:25.248 --> 03:29.168
Luis, I'm going to Morajo
Bay, to the institute.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.962
You two are to
wait here in the camp.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.046
You be gone long?

03:32.130 --> 03:34.591
Long enough to
find out what this is

03:34.674 --> 03:37.802
and get help in digging out
the rest of the skeleton.

03:43.683 --> 03:48.563
I want a man in camp at all times.
Luis, you will be in charge.

04:49.374 --> 04:51.626
I'm sure you scared
all the fish away.

04:51.709 --> 04:52.961
At the depths
he's working, Doctor,

04:53.044 --> 04:55.880
the fish won't hear a
thing, believe me.

05:47.557 --> 05:49.517
There he is. See him?

05:49.600 --> 05:50.852
What's he waiting for?

05:50.935 --> 05:53.771
He's getting used to
the change in pressure.

05:59.694 --> 06:01.320
Here he comes.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.781
Hi.

06:03.865 --> 06:06.075
David. David, I have
a surprise for you.

06:06.159 --> 06:07.785
Yeah?

06:09.287 --> 06:10.997
Carl Maia!

06:11.080 --> 06:12.248
It isn't you!

06:12.331 --> 06:14.876
What's left of me,
Dr. David Reed.

06:14.959 --> 06:17.420
The last I heard of you, you
were up in the Amazon someplace

06:17.503 --> 06:19.088
digging for old
skeletons and things.

06:19.172 --> 06:22.050
And you two were doing research
for an aquarium in California.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.551
What are you doing in Brazil?

06:23.634 --> 06:26.429
On, we've been guests at your
institute for a month now.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.639
We're looking for
specimens of lungfish.

06:28.723 --> 06:32.185
David, you still don't look like
an ichthyologist.

06:32.268 --> 06:33.811
A geologist's point of view.

06:33.895 --> 06:36.856
He expected a loveable old
professor with a beard.

06:36.939 --> 06:40.068
I didn't expect him to look like he
did when he was a student of mine.

06:40.151 --> 06:42.153
Give me a shoulder, Kay.

06:43.279 --> 06:44.864
Are you two married yet?

06:44.947 --> 06:47.116
No. No, David says we're
together all the time anyway,

06:47.200 --> 06:49.160
might as well save expenses.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.913
Did you ever hear of two
living as cheaply as one?

06:51.996 --> 06:53.372
That's what I keep
telling him, Carl.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.875
I'm waiting for Williams
to give her that raise.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.543
Then she can afford me.

06:57.627 --> 07:01.005
Come on. Let's go ashore.
It's good to see you again, Carl.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.051
Show him what
brought you back, Carl.

07:06.344 --> 07:08.429
I found this in
a limestone deposit

07:08.513 --> 07:11.015
dating back to
the Devonian age.

07:19.816 --> 07:21.901
I was hoping you
experts on marine life

07:21.984 --> 07:23.402
could make some identification.

07:23.653 --> 07:25.404
I've never seen
anything like this.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.156
Look at the webbing
between the fingers, David.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.324
Yeah.

07:28.658 --> 07:32.537
Maybe we'll know more about it after
I find the rest of the skeleton.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.455
Boy, I'd sure like to
be with you when you do.

07:34.539 --> 07:35.665
So would I.

07:35.748 --> 07:38.793
What about your boss?
You think he would be interested?

07:38.876 --> 07:40.336
Williams?

07:40.419 --> 07:43.589
If there's a chance of any publicity,
just try and keep him away.

07:43.673 --> 07:46.467
Now, be fair, David.
Publicity brings endowments.

07:46.551 --> 07:48.469
And without money,
there isn't any research.

07:48.553 --> 07:51.722
That's right, if it weren't for Dr.
Williams going on digging up the dough,

07:51.806 --> 07:53.808
we wouldn't be down here.

07:54.976 --> 07:56.394
Where is this thing?

07:56.477 --> 07:57.854
At the institute.

08:22.211 --> 08:24.422
Here it is, gentlemen.

08:26.716 --> 08:28.926
Exactly as I found it.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.138
- It's amazing.
- It's incredible!

08:33.264 --> 08:36.308
Could it possibly
belong to a Pleistocene man?

08:36.558 --> 08:38.227
Chances are much
greater that that hand

08:38.311 --> 08:39.687
belonged to an amphibian, Mark,

08:39.770 --> 08:42.106
one that spent a great
deal of time in the water.

08:42.190 --> 08:44.692
Well, then now do you account for
the structure of the fingers,

08:44.775 --> 08:46.694
obviously for land use?

08:47.111 --> 08:48.946
What do you think, Dr. Matos?

08:49.155 --> 08:53.284
We can be sure of one thing.
Whatever it was, it was very powerful.

08:53.993 --> 08:56.537
You say you have hopes of
finding the rest of the fossil?

08:56.621 --> 08:59.207
As soon as I get a suitable
expedition together.

08:59.290 --> 09:02.043
Well, why don't we
make up the expedition?

09:02.126 --> 09:03.377
We're here now, and after all,

09:03.461 --> 09:05.546
it does come under the heading
of our work, doesn't it, David?

09:05.630 --> 09:06.964
It certainly does.

09:07.048 --> 09:09.008
More and more,
we're learning the meaning

09:09.091 --> 09:10.968
and the value of
marine research.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.804
Look, look over here.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.182
This lungfish,

09:16.474 --> 09:19.310
the bridge between fish
and the land animal.

09:19.393 --> 09:22.772
How many thousands of ways nature
tried to get life out of the sea

09:22.855 --> 09:24.232
and onto the land.

09:24.315 --> 09:28.027
This one failed.
He hasn't changed in millions of years.

09:28.819 --> 09:29.862
But here,

09:31.155 --> 09:33.824
here we have
a clue to an answer.

09:33.908 --> 09:36.911
Someday, spaceships will be traveling
from Earth to other planets.

09:36.994 --> 09:39.455
How are human beings going
to survive on those planets?

09:39.538 --> 09:41.040
The atmosphere
will be different,

09:41.123 --> 09:42.959
the pressures
will be different.

09:44.627 --> 09:47.129
By studying these
and other species,

09:47.213 --> 09:49.298
we add to our knowledge
of how life evolved,

09:49.382 --> 09:52.009
how it adapted itself
to this world.

09:52.093 --> 09:54.553
With that knowledge,
perhaps we can teach men

09:54.637 --> 09:57.223
to adapt themselves to some
new world of the future.

09:57.306 --> 10:00.518
Nice speech, David, but there's
still a practical side to it.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.145
If I sound brash and more like
a banker than a scientist,

10:03.229 --> 10:06.607
try to remember that it takes money
to run an institute like ours.

10:06.691 --> 10:08.609
A find of any real
importance can be

10:08.693 --> 10:11.195
of great financial
value to us also.

10:11.279 --> 10:13.197
Certainly, your board
couldnâ€™t disapprove.

10:13.281 --> 10:14.782
It certainly couldn't.

10:15.366 --> 10:17.910
Dr. Maia, you've got
yourself an expedition.

10:17.994 --> 10:20.288
Good, we'll leave for
Manaus in the morning.

10:20.371 --> 10:23.040
From there, we'll take
a boat up river.

11:06.042 --> 11:07.877
Tomas!

11:12.131 --> 11:14.717
No, no, no!

11:53.130 --> 11:54.882
It's so hot.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.967
It'll get hotter.

12:00.304 --> 12:03.891
Couldn't Maia find anything
better than this barge?

12:03.974 --> 12:07.311
Well, I guess not many ships want to
go up river as far as we're going.

12:07.395 --> 12:10.648
We didn't exactly expect to
get the lie de France either.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.566
You don't like the Rita?

12:12.650 --> 12:13.901
What the doctor meant, Lucas...

12:13.984 --> 12:15.444
I know what the doctor means.

12:15.528 --> 12:17.738
But what for I need
a sweet-smelling boat

12:17.822 --> 12:20.408
to carry fish on
this crazy river?

12:20.491 --> 12:23.119
How do you like the best cabin
on the Rita, Miss Lawrence?

12:23.202 --> 12:24.245
I love it!

12:24.328 --> 12:25.329
Good.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.958
Well, now we have a lab,
such as it is.

12:29.041 --> 12:31.043
Let's hope we have
some use for it.

12:31.127 --> 12:33.170
I'll be disappointed
if we don't.

12:33.295 --> 12:36.340
Assuming, of course, that Dr.
Maia's facts are well-founded.

12:36.424 --> 12:40.594
Dr. Maia's a scientist, not a fortuneteller
How can he guarantee anything?

12:40.678 --> 12:42.763
Well, it seems to me,
a scientist has need

12:42.847 --> 12:45.516
for both vision and confidence.

12:45.599 --> 12:48.686
I didn't mean it as any
personal criticism, Doctor.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.772
It's just that I always
look forward to success.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.715
And I thought the
Mississippi was something.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.468
It's a winding brook
compared to the Amazon.

13:21.177 --> 13:24.138
This is exactly as it was
150 million years ago

13:24.221 --> 13:26.223
when it was part
of the Devonian era.

13:26.307 --> 13:28.309
Sounds like the
beginning of the world.

13:28.392 --> 13:29.768
It is.

13:29.852 --> 13:33.772
Even the animals here grow as
they did in Devonian forests.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.984
The anteater is a giant
with the strength of a bear.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.570
The centipede grows
to be a foot long.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.239
The Amazonian rat
is as big as a sheep.

13:42.323 --> 13:43.449
That's incredible.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.617
But it's true.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.785
Don't forget our catfish.

13:46.869 --> 13:50.122
They grow to be nine
feet long, and killers!

13:50.206 --> 13:53.250
Like everything in this
jungle, all killers.

13:53.334 --> 13:56.670
Dr. Maia says we're gonna drop
anchor in a couple of hours.

13:56.754 --> 13:59.131
Maybe you'd better
get some rest.

14:06.639 --> 14:08.182
Again, Lucas.

14:10.226 --> 14:13.145
We want to make sure
my boys hear us at camp.

14:13.229 --> 14:15.981
When we anchor,
we'll take a rowboat.

14:18.776 --> 14:20.861
Luis!

14:21.320 --> 14:23.155
Tomas!

14:23.822 --> 14:25.241
Luis!

14:30.371 --> 14:32.665
Luis! Tomas!

14:34.625 --> 14:36.293
Strange they'd be gone.

14:36.377 --> 14:37.711
Could they have gone hunting?

14:37.795 --> 14:41.465
I gave strict orders for one man
to remain in camp at all times.

14:41.549 --> 14:42.925
Come on!

14:43.008 --> 14:46.136
Stay here, Kay.
Wait till we find out what's going on.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.145
Luis!

14:56.397 --> 14:58.399
What could have happened?

14:58.482 --> 15:00.234
I don't understand it.

15:00.317 --> 15:03.696
There is only one explanation.
The country is full of wild animals.

15:03.779 --> 15:08.325
I think maybe jaguar.
Jaguar's claws, they rip like this.

15:24.883 --> 15:27.511
Where's Kay? Kay?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.346
Kay!

15:32.516 --> 15:33.601
What happened?

15:33.684 --> 15:35.102
There's been trouble.

15:38.439 --> 15:40.691
Let's go back on board, Kay.

16:29.531 --> 16:32.034
A world-shaking find,
all right.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.666
Eight days.

16:39.750 --> 16:43.170
All we dig up are enough
stones to pave a road.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.506
Had enough, Mark,
or do we keep on digging?

16:45.589 --> 16:47.466
I'll tell you when
I've had enough.

16:49.259 --> 16:52.721
We've failed, that's all
people will understand.

16:57.643 --> 17:02.231
Carl, have you any idea what
this tributary empties into?

17:02.648 --> 17:06.276
My boys used to tell me there's
a lagoon at the end of it.

17:06.944 --> 17:09.070
What are you getting at?

17:09.154 --> 17:10.948
I was just thinking.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.367
It could be that at
some time in the past,

17:13.450 --> 17:16.369
part of this bank broke away
and fell into the river here.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.997
Over hundreds of years, perhaps
over thousands of years,

17:19.080 --> 17:20.624
the current would break it up.

17:20.708 --> 17:22.584
If there is a dead end
to this tributary,

17:22.667 --> 17:24.545
that's where we'll
find the fragments.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.256
We might even find
the rest of your fossil.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.590
It's a theory.

17:28.674 --> 17:30.050
What's wrong with that?

17:30.134 --> 17:32.386
Even if David's
theory is correct,

17:32.469 --> 17:34.888
the chances of finding
anything are remote.

17:34.972 --> 17:37.641
Science is always taking the remote chance.
Why don't we try it?

17:37.725 --> 17:39.476
We might still turn
failure into success.

17:39.601 --> 17:42.312
Well, there's just
one thing, Mark,

17:42.396 --> 17:45.733
going into unexplored
territory with a woman.

17:45.816 --> 17:48.485
I'm not afraid, David,
and we've come this far.

17:48.569 --> 17:49.945
Yeah, I know,

17:50.028 --> 17:52.322
but I keep remembering
what happened to Carl's men.

17:52.698 --> 17:55.617
That doesn't sound like the
dedicated scientist talking, David.

17:55.701 --> 17:58.620
Dedication doesn't mean
risking the lives of others.

17:58.704 --> 18:01.331
I've always found Kay was
able to take care of herself.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.459
But we know nothing
about this lagoon.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.836
I can tell you something
about this place.

18:05.919 --> 18:09.590
My boys call it the "Black
Lagoon," a paradise.

18:09.673 --> 18:13.093
Only, they say nobody
has ever come back to prove it.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.723
We'll do it.

18:42.039 --> 18:43.290
Oh, David.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.708
I didn't mean to startle you.

18:44.792 --> 18:46.960
I don't know what
made me do that.

18:47.044 --> 18:49.630
That howling out there
doesn't help any.

18:49.713 --> 18:51.757
Those are guariba monkeys.

18:52.883 --> 18:55.010
You sorry now that we came?

18:56.053 --> 18:58.722
You don't understand the
species very well, Doctor.

18:58.806 --> 19:01.183
Well, give me time.
I thought I was doing well,

19:01.266 --> 19:05.062
considering that we've only
been together for six months.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.689
How much time do you
think you'll need?

19:07.773 --> 19:11.276
From where I'm sitting,
I'd say a lifetime.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.112
That's the right answer.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.827
We may not even
have a lifetime.

19:19.910 --> 19:21.620
In that case...

19:26.041 --> 19:28.252
You mean this thing
really works?

19:30.254 --> 19:32.214
Oh, yes.

19:32.297 --> 19:34.132
It's a very positive weapon,
the spear gun, Lucas,

19:34.633 --> 19:36.051
and easy to use.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.178
All you do is
aim it and squeeze.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.972
What are you going to shoot at?

19:41.098 --> 19:43.267
Does it make any difference?

19:57.739 --> 19:59.199
Can you take it any slower?

19:59.700 --> 20:02.244
Ease her off.
Little bit, not too much.

20:02.870 --> 20:03.996
Give me that boat hook.

20:04.079 --> 20:05.539
I think we can just
make it on this side.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.082
It's tight over here.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.966
It's impossible.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.552
But I, Lucas, will do it.

20:38.363 --> 20:40.616
The Black Lagoon.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.492
The beautiful lagoon.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.203
Another world.

20:46.663 --> 20:49.124
Take her out a little farther, then
we'll get the net over the side.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.918
You expect to catch a fish?

20:51.001 --> 20:53.253
We might as well find out
what species are here.

20:53.337 --> 20:55.255
We're not interested in what
species of fish are here.

20:55.339 --> 20:57.090
We're after the rest of
that fossil, remember?

20:57.174 --> 20:59.718
I need some rocks from the
bottom of the lagoon for a test.

20:59.801 --> 21:01.678
But we just got here.
Why waste time?

21:01.762 --> 21:03.138
If any parts of the
wall that contained

21:03.221 --> 21:04.765
the fossil were
ever deposited in here,

21:04.848 --> 21:06.475
the rock test should prove it.
Yeah.

21:06.558 --> 21:07.851
I'll get the Aqua-Lungs.

21:07.935 --> 21:11.438
You be careful, David.
We don't know what's down there.

21:12.814 --> 21:15.567
I hope you're afraid
for me too, Kay.

21:15.651 --> 21:17.361
Of course, Mark.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.702
A little faster.
Come on! Faster!

21:25.786 --> 21:28.288
All right, let her down.
All the way.

21:28.372 --> 21:31.249
Come on, down, down.
All the way.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.543
All right. Hold it!

21:35.337 --> 21:36.922
Here we go.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.215
We got the net down, David.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.383
Good.

21:40.884 --> 21:44.137
This is crazy kind of fishing.
Who eats rocks?

21:44.221 --> 21:46.682
I do, in a manner of speaking.

21:46.765 --> 21:48.976
I crush them and
they tell me things.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.478
Now, you be careful.

23:56.853 --> 23:59.356
What these rocks
tell you, anyway?

23:59.439 --> 24:03.401
How old they are.
It's called the uranium-lead test.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.987
What do you wanna
know that for?

24:07.364 --> 24:12.160
So we can match them against the
sample in which the fossil was found.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.328
Hey, they're up!

26:19.579 --> 26:21.081
How long they
have to wait there?

26:21.164 --> 26:23.291
It depends on how
far down they went.

26:39.683 --> 26:41.601
Well, how was it down there?

26:41.685 --> 26:42.686
Oh, fine.

26:42.811 --> 26:44.354
Come on, I'll help you
off with this equipment.

26:44.437 --> 26:45.438
Good.

26:45.522 --> 26:47.774
Carl, I got your samples.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.359
Good.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.236
Let me have them.

26:51.319 --> 26:52.529
Here they are.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.615
Thank you, David.

26:55.699 --> 26:57.534
And this is something for you.

26:57.617 --> 27:00.996
Oh! Well, thank you.
They're very pretty.

27:01.079 --> 27:02.539
Let's test them right away.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.457
- Will you help me, Doctor?
- Be glad to.

27:04.541 --> 27:06.209
DR. MAIA Thank you.

27:11.673 --> 27:14.551
Come on, David.
You can play house later.

27:17.721 --> 27:21.141
David. About Mark.

27:21.224 --> 27:22.559
Well, what about him?

27:22.642 --> 27:24.436
Try to understand.

27:24.519 --> 27:26.062
I've been trying.

27:26.146 --> 27:28.148
Somebody ought to tell him
his ambition is showing.

27:28.231 --> 27:30.150
It won't do any good, I know.

27:30.233 --> 27:32.986
Long before you came to
work with us, I tried.

27:33.069 --> 27:35.238
But there's this
to say for him,

27:35.322 --> 27:37.657
he's produced some
important findings.

27:37.741 --> 27:40.660
He's also taken credit
for some important findings.

27:41.244 --> 27:42.746
Well, coming below?

27:42.829 --> 27:47.000
No. No, I'll wait up here.
Hey, what was it like down there?

27:48.126 --> 27:50.503
Like another world.

27:50.587 --> 27:52.672
I'd like to see it.

31:07.367 --> 31:10.161
Crazy kind of fishing,
for rocks!

31:12.914 --> 31:14.290
Miss Lawrence!

31:14.958 --> 31:16.793
Miss Lawrence!

31:17.210 --> 31:20.171
You're too far out,
Miss Lawrence!

31:23.258 --> 31:26.344
Hey, Zee! Go start the motor!

31:26.427 --> 31:28.638
Chico! Pull up the anchor!

31:44.487 --> 31:48.575
Kay, what are you doing out there?
Come on back!

31:48.658 --> 31:51.703
You take it easy. We get you!

32:08.303 --> 32:10.221
Drop the anchor.

32:22.734 --> 32:24.694
Thanks, Lucas.

32:25.069 --> 32:27.488
Kay, that wasn't
a very smart thing to do.

32:27.572 --> 32:29.407
KAY; But wonderful!

32:32.452 --> 32:33.828
What was that?

32:33.911 --> 32:35.330
Something's in the net.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.709
Pull up your net!

32:39.792 --> 32:42.086
Come on. Hurry up!
Take it away!

32:43.713 --> 32:45.048
Pull it up!

32:46.257 --> 32:47.884
Pull it up!

32:59.020 --> 33:01.230
Is it fouled against the side?

33:01.814 --> 33:03.316
Pull it up!

33:08.321 --> 33:09.739
The boom's cracking!

33:11.741 --> 33:13.076
Slack off your winch!

33:14.786 --> 33:15.828
Slack off!

33:15.912 --> 33:17.080
He can't hear you!

33:37.600 --> 33:40.311
Hey, what kind of fish do this?

33:40.395 --> 33:41.396
Who says it was a fish?

33:41.479 --> 33:43.523
The net could've hooked on
to some underwater rock.

33:45.775 --> 33:47.610
Wait a minute.

33:48.236 --> 33:50.780
It was no rock that
left this in the net.

33:53.449 --> 33:55.368
It's amazing!

33:55.451 --> 33:57.537
I just finished
the rock analysis.

33:57.620 --> 33:59.122
And you were right, David.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.833
Some of the limestone deposit
where I found the fossil

34:01.916 --> 34:04.293
is on the bottom
of this lagoon.

34:13.344 --> 34:16.723
Lucas, put that over the
side for me, will you?

34:16.806 --> 34:20.393
Whatever the species might be, if you
let it alone, it won't bother you.

34:20.476 --> 34:24.397
Maybe. But if you're wrong, this
harpoon will correct any mistakes.

34:24.897 --> 34:28.109
Mark, we're out for photographs
for study, not trophies.

34:28.192 --> 34:32.237
This thing alive and in its natural
habitat, it's valuable to us.

34:32.321 --> 34:35.199
Why settle for a photo when
we can get the real thing?

34:35.283 --> 34:36.451
You don't sound
like a scientist.

34:36.534 --> 34:40.036
You sound like some big-game
hunter out for the kill.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.748
We may not be back home, David,

34:41.831 --> 34:44.083
but you're still
working for me.

39:29.744 --> 39:32.997
You didn't wait long
enough before coming up.

39:35.332 --> 39:37.043
Why'd you shoot?
You weren't attacked!

39:37.126 --> 39:39.420
You sound as though I put
the harpoon through you.

39:39.503 --> 39:40.671
What makes you think
we're supposed

39:40.755 --> 39:42.381
to play tag with the
thing, whatever it is?

39:42.465 --> 39:44.133
I tell you, we can learn
more from it if it's alive!

39:44.592 --> 39:46.844
Please, what is it
that you found?

39:46.927 --> 39:48.387
I don't know
what you'd call it.

39:48.471 --> 39:51.640
It sounds incredible, but
it appeared to be human.

39:52.183 --> 39:53.726
I tell you,

39:53.809 --> 39:56.729
if it's what I think I saw,
it's the greatest find yet.

39:56.812 --> 39:58.064
Nothing compares to it.

39:58.147 --> 40:00.066
I've got the proof
here in my lens.

40:08.324 --> 40:11.077
Many years ago, I hear
this legend on the river.

40:11.160 --> 40:14.121
A very old native tell me of
a man who live underwater,

40:14.205 --> 40:15.623
but she was crazy.

40:15.706 --> 40:18.334
"Crazy Goole," everybody called her.

40:18.417 --> 40:20.586
The unknown always
seems unbelievable, Lucas.

40:21.212 --> 40:23.547
One accepts these things as
legend and lets it go at that,

40:23.631 --> 40:25.633
but to actually believe
that there exists something

40:25.716 --> 40:27.718
like a human being
that can live underwater...

40:28.302 --> 40:31.347
This is no legend, as you'll
soon see for yourself.

40:31.430 --> 40:32.807
What about the kamongo?

40:32.890 --> 40:35.226
Science hadn't heard about
it until a few years ago.

40:35.309 --> 40:37.770
The kamongo lived way back
in the Devonian age.

40:37.853 --> 40:41.690
Interesting that the fossil I
found was out of the same period.

40:41.774 --> 40:44.235
The kamongo was
a fish that breathed air.

40:44.318 --> 40:46.195
- What does that prove?
- Nothing.

40:46.362 --> 40:48.489
Except that the kamongo
fish, which has lungs,

40:48.572 --> 40:50.741
exists today, right
here in the Amazon.

40:50.825 --> 40:52.952
It hasn't changed in all
these millions of years.

40:53.035 --> 40:55.454
That doesn't prove the
possibility of a gillman.

40:55.538 --> 40:57.331
If the evolution
of that species

40:57.414 --> 40:59.208
could reach a dead end
way back then

40:59.291 --> 41:00.751
and still survive,

41:00.835 --> 41:02.503
why couldn't another?

41:05.714 --> 41:07.299
Where is he?

41:08.092 --> 41:10.553
I was sure I had him
in my finder.

41:11.220 --> 41:13.848
For a merman,
he takes a fine picture.

41:13.931 --> 41:16.308
This wasn't
imagination, Doctor.

41:16.392 --> 41:17.476
I'm sorry, David.

41:17.560 --> 41:20.312
What proof do we have
if we never find it again?

41:20.396 --> 41:22.356
If you hadn't stopped me,
we could have taken it!

41:22.439 --> 41:24.316
Dead or alive,
what's the difference?

41:44.962 --> 41:46.338
What happened?

41:46.422 --> 41:47.590
Chico!

41:49.466 --> 41:51.343
What happened?

41:51.427 --> 41:53.220
Chico!

41:55.556 --> 41:57.016
Chico is gone.

41:57.099 --> 42:00.519
My brother was dragged down
into the water by a demon!

42:00.603 --> 42:01.979
Come on, everybody,
look around, quick!

42:02.062 --> 42:03.105
Chico!

42:03.189 --> 42:04.565
Demon, eh?

42:04.648 --> 42:07.401
It's no more far-fetched
than your gillman.

42:07.484 --> 42:10.196
There are many strange
legends in the Amazon.

42:10.279 --> 42:14.033
Even I, Lucas, have heard
the legend of a man-fish.

42:14.116 --> 42:15.784
Over here! Quickly!

42:17.953 --> 42:19.288
LOOK!

42:29.924 --> 42:32.551
All right, Lucas,
start your pumps.

42:32.635 --> 42:34.553
Now all we have
to do is catch him.

42:34.637 --> 42:36.805
Don't waste your time.
You'll never take it alive.

42:36.889 --> 42:38.140
I want to try, Mark.

42:38.390 --> 42:41.185
All right, David, we can
always do it my way.

42:41.268 --> 42:44.146
If we could just be sure
of its reaction.

42:44.230 --> 42:47.566
Do you suppose it remembers
Mark's attack and seeks revenge?

42:47.650 --> 42:49.401
I'll welcome it.

42:49.485 --> 42:51.654
You'll get your wish,
all right.

42:51.737 --> 42:56.367
I've got a hunch this creature
remembers the past and more.

42:56.450 --> 42:59.245
I don't want him creeping up
on us while we're sleeping.

42:59.328 --> 43:01.163
I know a way to
bring him up now.

43:02.164 --> 43:03.582
Rotenone.

43:03.666 --> 43:05.584
It's a drug which
natives make from roots

43:05.668 --> 43:07.544
for catching fish
in still waters.

43:07.628 --> 43:10.297
Sometimes I catch fish that way.
I show you. Look.

43:12.675 --> 43:14.134
Excuse.

43:15.386 --> 43:18.305
One taste of the poison
water, and poof!

43:18.389 --> 43:21.767
The paralyzed fish floats up to
the top with a big hangover.

43:21.850 --> 43:24.061
Come on! Let's try it.

44:28.876 --> 44:30.294
Still no sign.

44:30.377 --> 44:32.463
Nothing but
the little ones so far.

44:32.546 --> 44:34.089
Could be he's dead
from the wound.

44:35.215 --> 44:39.178
Then again, maybe the rotenone
isn't going deep enough.

44:39.261 --> 44:42.765
Maybe we should fix the
rotenone to sink deeper down.

44:43.599 --> 44:46.435
Yeah. Anything is worth a try.

45:35.984 --> 45:37.403
What was that?

45:38.028 --> 45:39.530
I don't know.

45:54.086 --> 45:55.712
Come on. Come on.

45:57.005 --> 46:00.426
You talking to me, Mark,
or something out there?

46:00.509 --> 46:02.094
Both, David.

46:03.178 --> 46:06.181
They won't believe it
back home, none of them.

46:06.265 --> 46:09.017
I wouldn't have
believed it myself.

46:09.685 --> 46:13.522
Sitting out here, waiting
for some monster to appear.

46:14.481 --> 46:16.650
That's why we've
got to take him.

46:17.359 --> 46:19.194
Why won't they believe, Mark?

46:19.695 --> 46:21.822
Because we deal
with known quantities,

46:21.905 --> 46:24.366
with knowledge we've
accumulated up to now.

46:24.741 --> 46:28.704
We've just begun to learn about
the water and its secrets,

46:28.787 --> 46:32.207
just as we've only
touched on outer space.

46:32.666 --> 46:34.418
We don't entirely
rule out the possibility

46:34.501 --> 46:37.713
that there might be some form
of life on another planet.

46:38.547 --> 46:41.675
Then why not some entirely
different form of life

46:41.758 --> 46:46.847
in a world we already know is inhabited
by millions of living creatures?

46:47.931 --> 46:50.350
We must have the proof!

48:28.448 --> 48:30.826
In the water!
The lantern frightened him off.

48:31.493 --> 48:32.536
No.

48:46.633 --> 48:48.010
There he is!

49:00.355 --> 49:01.440
It's foolish to go after him.

49:01.523 --> 49:02.608
But he's drugged.

49:02.691 --> 49:03.692
No, I'd wait anyway.

49:03.775 --> 49:05.068
If he has gills,
he may suffocate

49:05.152 --> 49:06.403
How long does the effect last?

49:06.486 --> 49:07.654
An hour, maybe two.

49:07.738 --> 49:09.698
But for that thing,
who can tell?

49:09.781 --> 49:11.408
Carl, follow me in a rowboat.
Bring a net.

49:11.491 --> 49:12.701
Wait, I'm going along with you.

49:12.784 --> 49:14.703
I keep you covered.

49:31.762 --> 49:33.597
That's where he went under.

49:33.680 --> 49:36.516
I'm going to take a look.
Wait here.

50:37.828 --> 50:40.914
Take it easy!
He went through here, come on.

51:47.397 --> 51:48.690
Zee!

52:18.220 --> 52:21.223
Oh, David! David!

52:22.015 --> 52:25.602
We got him! We got him!

52:26.645 --> 52:28.313
- Don't kill him!
- What happened?

52:28.396 --> 52:29.481
Give me the net.

52:36.780 --> 52:38.448
How is he?

52:39.282 --> 52:40.617
He's dead.

52:49.084 --> 52:50.252
That's the last one.

52:50.335 --> 52:51.503
All right.

52:54.381 --> 52:55.549
Will he live?

52:55.632 --> 52:57.008
I don't know.

52:57.092 --> 52:58.510
It depends on whether
he can survive

52:58.593 --> 53:00.679
both the rotenone and being
out of the water so long.

53:00.762 --> 53:02.681
You sound as if you
feel sorry for him.

53:02.764 --> 53:05.767
Why? He could have
killed you just as easily.

53:05.851 --> 53:07.060
But he didn't.

53:07.143 --> 53:08.603
It doesn't make
any difference now.

53:08.687 --> 53:10.605
The point is, he won't
do any more killing.

53:10.689 --> 53:12.858
Any time you're ready,
Lucas, we can start back.

53:12.941 --> 53:14.901
Mark, we're not
finished here yet.

53:14.985 --> 53:16.611
We've got to make
a study of that grotto,

53:16.695 --> 53:18.238
we've got to collect
photographs, data...

53:18.321 --> 53:20.782
I've got all the proof I need.
Get going, Lucas.

53:20.866 --> 53:24.327
Mark, we're not going anywhere
until we've finished our work.

53:30.792 --> 53:34.212
All right, David, if it will
make you feel any better.

53:34.296 --> 53:37.632
Oh, Doctor, would you mind staying
behind and keep an eye on our prize?

53:38.592 --> 53:40.051
Don't be long, David.

53:42.137 --> 53:43.513
You better get some rest.

55:09.891 --> 55:11.017
Hi.

55:13.895 --> 55:16.648
I thought I'd come up
and get some air.

55:20.986 --> 55:23.822
What do you suppose
is taking them so long?

55:23.905 --> 55:25.824
David's very thorough.

55:26.574 --> 55:28.994
But shouldn't you
be resting, Kay?

55:29.077 --> 55:30.745
I couldn't sleep.

55:32.247 --> 55:34.165
Listen to the sounds.

55:34.249 --> 55:38.169
Hunting calls, mostly.
Animals out for the kill.

55:38.253 --> 55:40.588
Some of them are cries of fear,

55:40.672 --> 55:43.008
like people who
whistle in the dark.

55:43.091 --> 55:44.801
I'm not exactly blind.

55:45.427 --> 55:49.222
You're worried about what's
happened between Mark and David.

55:49.305 --> 55:51.599
But once you admit
the simple fact

55:51.683 --> 55:54.019
that you're in love,
which you have,

55:54.102 --> 55:56.438
then it becomes a good idea
to be the scientist about it.

55:57.022 --> 55:58.148
It's not as easy as that.

55:58.231 --> 55:59.524
Why not?

56:00.275 --> 56:03.028
If it weren't for Mark Williams,
I wouldn't have my work

56:03.111 --> 56:04.529
or even a job.

56:04.612 --> 56:07.949
It's true, he helped you through
your training and gave you a job.

56:08.033 --> 56:10.618
But he needed you just as
much as you needed him.

56:10.910 --> 56:12.203
You're oversimplifying.

56:12.287 --> 56:15.165
You've more than repaid
him many times over.

56:15.248 --> 56:17.375
Why, a good part of his present
position at the institute

56:17.459 --> 56:19.419
is due to your
valuable research.

56:19.502 --> 56:20.962
And another thing...

56:23.715 --> 56:25.592
Get away, Kay!

56:29.137 --> 56:31.681
Go on, get back! Go on!

56:46.071 --> 56:47.989
Dr. Thompson!

57:22.524 --> 57:24.359
How is he?

57:25.193 --> 57:27.821
If infection doesn't set
in, he may pull through.

57:28.363 --> 57:31.616
The fool! It wouldn't have happened
if he hadn't been careless.

57:31.699 --> 57:33.701
There's no one to blame.

57:33.785 --> 57:36.287
Four men dead so far.

57:36.371 --> 57:40.458
If he dies, what a useless waste
of experience and ability.

57:41.251 --> 57:43.878
Nobody meant it
to happen, David.

57:47.382 --> 57:51.970
Mark, I'm for getting out of this
lagoon just as fast as we can.

57:52.053 --> 57:53.638
Without taking
what we came for?

57:53.721 --> 57:56.641
We didn't come here to fight with monsters.
We're not equipped for it.

57:56.724 --> 57:58.268
We came here to find fossils.

57:58.351 --> 58:01.521
Later, later, we can come back with
a properly equipped expedition.

58:01.604 --> 58:02.689
Be reasonable.

58:02.772 --> 58:04.065
Reasonable?

58:04.732 --> 58:06.568
What else could I expect?

58:06.901 --> 58:09.404
But you, Carl,
it means as much to you.

58:09.487 --> 58:10.905
You're driving
yourself too hard,

58:10.989 --> 58:13.449
and the rest of us
along with you.

58:13.533 --> 58:15.410
We're staying until we get him.

58:15.493 --> 58:17.704
Or until somebody else
gets killed.

58:17.787 --> 58:19.164
No, we're not.

58:19.247 --> 58:22.000
Lucas, we're getting out of
here just as fast as we can.

58:22.083 --> 58:23.376
Okay.

58:25.378 --> 58:27.922
I'll make the decisions around here.

58:28.006 --> 58:29.841
But you are wrong,
Mr. Williams.

58:29.924 --> 58:32.594
On the water, the captain
makes the decisions.

58:32.677 --> 58:34.429
We will do as you say.

58:34.512 --> 58:36.764
You'll listen to me.

58:38.766 --> 58:41.728
You wish to say
something, mister?

58:43.605 --> 58:46.274
Dr. Maia, will you please
to pull up the anchor?

58:46.649 --> 58:48.526
I will start the engine.

59:36.783 --> 59:37.909
DR. MAIA Look Out!

59:37.992 --> 59:39.869
There's something here.
Look out!

59:39.953 --> 59:41.412
Look out!

59:41.496 --> 59:44.374
Hold back. Hold back.
There's something here.

59:46.167 --> 59:48.503
Hold back! Hold back!

59:53.758 --> 59:56.344
I tell you, nothing
was there when we came in.

59:56.844 --> 59:59.764
It was put there to keep
us from getting out.

59:59.847 --> 01:00:01.224
By mm.

01:00:01.307 --> 01:00:02.934
I check below for damage.

01:00:03.017 --> 01:00:04.644
I go aft and keep watch.

01:00:04.727 --> 01:00:06.980
You better stay with Thompson.

01:00:08.564 --> 01:00:10.566
It's our last chance,
David, to get the proof.

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.610
Look, you can see for
yourself, it's still here.

01:00:12.694 --> 01:00:14.612
We're trapped and
fighting for our lives,

01:00:14.696 --> 01:00:17.115
and you're worried about whether
people will believe us.

01:00:17.198 --> 01:00:19.659
Ls all right down below.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:29.127
Go in the cabin
and lock the door.

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:31.546
No, no. Stay here
with us. You're safer.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:35.550
Lucas. Lucas, start your winch.

01:00:35.925 --> 01:00:38.219
Go on, go on. Start your winch.

01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:45.310
Up an inch!

01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:48.229
Hold it!

01:00:51.065 --> 01:00:52.692
All right, give me some slack.

01:00:54.736 --> 01:00:55.945
A little more.

01:01:00.199 --> 01:01:02.160
Take it away!

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:06.289
Easy. A little more.

01:01:21.596 --> 01:01:22.722
Take it away!

01:01:23.348 --> 01:01:24.682
Take it up.

01:01:24.766 --> 01:01:26.100
More, more.

01:01:27.852 --> 01:01:29.228
Hold it.

01:01:31.898 --> 01:01:33.107
All right, take it away!

01:01:35.193 --> 01:01:36.903
UP, up!

01:02:17.527 --> 01:02:19.904
She must have slipped.

01:02:19.987 --> 01:02:21.572
We'll just have
to try it again.

01:02:21.656 --> 01:02:23.408
How, David?

01:02:24.784 --> 01:02:27.078
I'll have to use the Aqua-Lung.

01:02:29.831 --> 01:02:31.999
I'm going to help him.

01:02:41.551 --> 01:02:43.136
I'm going in with you.

01:02:43.219 --> 01:02:45.263
Mark, all we're
interested in right now is

01:02:45.346 --> 01:02:47.348
getting the entrance
to this lagoon cleared.

01:02:47.432 --> 01:02:48.724
I'll be the bait for him.

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:50.935
Oh, Mark, get out of my way.

01:02:51.018 --> 01:02:52.228
Let it come to me, David.

01:02:52.353 --> 01:02:54.522
It'll give you a chance to get at him.
You're crazy.

01:02:54.605 --> 01:02:57.442
Crazy to want to bring back the
biggest find anyone has ever made?

01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.944
You don't know what this can
mean, David, to all of us.

01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:01.904
Mark, you're not going with me!

01:03:01.988 --> 01:03:03.030
I am.

01:03:37.064 --> 01:03:39.984
Thank you, Carl.
Lucas, stand by the winch.

01:03:40.067 --> 01:03:41.944
Carl, stand by that cable.

01:07:57.825 --> 01:07:58.868
Oh!

01:08:32.651 --> 01:08:36.738
It's the only way.
We've got to clear this inlet.

01:08:36.822 --> 01:08:39.575
Hey, that fellow down there,

01:08:39.658 --> 01:08:41.911
you think maybe he's a
mosquito you can shoo away?

01:08:42.036 --> 01:08:44.078
We've got to take that chance.
Oh, sure!

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:46.457
Whats an expedition without
two martyrs, at least?

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:49.210
Kay, Kay, I'm doing
the only thing we can do.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:53.589
If we all just sit here,
we'll all end up as Mark did.

01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:56.884
Wait a minute!
Something you just said,

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:59.929
about his not being a mosquito.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:03.015
Maybe we won't have to fight him
on his own terms after all.

01:09:03.098 --> 01:09:04.558
How much rotenone
have we got left?

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:06.060
Not enough.

01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:07.728
Enough to use in a spray gun?

01:09:07.812 --> 01:09:09.188
What?

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:12.316
Oh! You mean, to kill
like a mosquito!

01:09:12.733 --> 01:09:14.318
It worked for us before.

01:09:14.401 --> 01:09:15.736
And it took plenty of time.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.571
All we want is
to make him groggy.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:21.158
Keep him away long enough so I can
get a cable around that tree.

01:09:21.242 --> 01:09:23.327
What do we use
for the spray gun?

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:25.412
One of the air bottles.

01:09:25.496 --> 01:09:27.997
A solution of rotenone
released under pressure,

01:09:28.082 --> 01:09:29.416
that ought to do the trick.

01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:31.585
- Some trick!
- Come on!

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.255
Lucas, you stand guard.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:35.421
Yes.

01:10:22.136 --> 01:10:23.888
Can you hurry it up?

01:10:23.971 --> 01:10:25.890
I shoot him, but I miss!

01:10:25.973 --> 01:10:28.767
He'll be back. Hurry.

01:13:12.973 --> 01:13:14.058
Give me a hand!

01:13:14.141 --> 01:13:15.184
David!

01:13:15.267 --> 01:13:16.769
Si!

01:13:17.770 --> 01:13:18.812
Did you see him?

01:13:18.896 --> 01:13:20.147
He's there, all right.

01:13:20.814 --> 01:13:22.149
Give me a hand
with this equipment.

01:13:22.232 --> 01:13:23.484
I'll help you.

01:13:23.567 --> 01:13:25.110
I got the cable around the log.

01:13:25.194 --> 01:13:26.236
Good.

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.446
Get ready with that winch.

01:13:27.529 --> 01:13:28.614
All right.

01:13:28.697 --> 01:13:30.657
I'll get her started.

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:38.832
Give it a little slack.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.168
- Ready to take her back.
- Ready.

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:43.003
Uncleat that line
for me, will you?

01:13:49.259 --> 01:13:50.844
All right, take her back.

01:13:51.929 --> 01:13:53.430
Take it back.

01:13:55.265 --> 01:13:59.061
Hard astern. She's coming.

01:13:59.144 --> 01:14:02.523
Back. Back.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.027
She's coming. Back.

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:09.780
Keep going. Hard astern.

01:14:23.377 --> 01:14:26.046
We're clear.

01:14:26.338 --> 01:14:28.382
Stand by to pull her
up with the winch.

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:30.134
Pull her in.

01:14:34.847 --> 01:14:36.723
That's it.

01:14:38.725 --> 01:14:41.103
I'll go down and unfasten it.

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:44.523
Give me slack!

01:14:44.606 --> 01:14:46.066
Good.

01:14:47.359 --> 01:14:49.069
More slack.

01:14:49.528 --> 01:14:51.321
Slack. That's enough.

01:14:54.199 --> 01:14:56.368
That's good.
Now you're getting it.

01:14:56.451 --> 01:14:59.246
Just slip it back
through the ring.

01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:04.334
Hurry, David!

01:15:04.418 --> 01:15:05.460
I've almost got it.

01:15:17.139 --> 01:15:18.640
He got her.

01:15:18.724 --> 01:15:21.560
No, don't shoot, don't shoot!
You might hit Kay.

01:15:31.028 --> 01:15:32.696
Give me a hand.

01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:46.877
Lucas, get to the
beach entrance.

01:16:01.266 --> 01:16:02.309
Kay!

01:16:04.645 --> 01:16:06.104
Kay!

01:16:19.451 --> 01:16:20.661
Kay?

01:16:56.196 --> 01:16:58.448
Kay. Kay, darling.

01:16:58.532 --> 01:17:01.326
Oh, David. David!

01:17:14.423 --> 01:17:16.717
Get back, Kay. Get back!

01:17:43.243 --> 01:17:45.245
No, no more. Let him go.

01:18:09.478 --> 01:18:10.937
No.
