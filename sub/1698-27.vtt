WEBVTT

00:04.370 --> 00:06.800
OK. Lilly, you ready for your first day?

00:06.830 --> 00:08.730
Aye aye, captain. Full speed ahead.

00:10.230 --> 00:12.850
Like a submarine, 'cause we're in a sub shop.

00:14.730 --> 00:16.129
My sandwiches are better than my jokes.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.060
Good. 'Cause you're my first hire as assistant manager

00:19.060 --> 00:20.450
and if you look good, then I look good.

00:20.630 --> 00:21.480
And if you don't look good...

00:22.290 --> 00:23.950
...don't go there, Dwight, don't go there...

00:24.220 --> 00:24.940
...don't go there.

00:27.190 --> 00:28.500
Well, someone looks hungry.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.120
Well I wasn't.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.520
But then I saw that girl over there, and I said to myself

00:33.950 --> 00:38.730
"Self, you want a sandwich made by her."

00:39.330 --> 00:41.770
Well, I only hire the best! Showtime!

00:41.990 --> 00:44.200
Hello, and welcome to The Smiling Sub,

00:44.250 --> 00:45.590
where every order comes with chuckling chips

00:45.640 --> 00:47.210
- and a large giddy gulp.  - Nice!

00:48.930 --> 00:51.160
Enjoy your meal.  Don't blow it.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.870
She'll be fine. She'll be fine! She'll be fine.

00:54.850 --> 00:57.010
Oh my gosh, you look so cute! Here...

00:57.440 --> 00:58.210
Say, "Ham and cheese!"

00:58.220 --> 00:58.960
Ham and cheese!

01:00.780 --> 01:02.060
And after a few paychecks

01:02.130 --> 01:03.990
and some generous tips, wink-wink,

01:04.060 --> 01:05.540
you can take one of me and Oliver

01:05.600 --> 01:07.540
buying our brand new used car!

01:09.430 --> 01:10.560
Now, what can I get you, Miss?

01:11.180 --> 01:12.730
I'll have a footlong, toasted,

01:12.830 --> 01:14.360
with roast beef, turkey and provolone,

01:14.360 --> 01:14.990
provolone on top,

01:15.050 --> 01:16.110
mustard and mayo on the bottom,

01:16.180 --> 01:17.160
three shakes salt, half a shake pepper

01:17.240 --> 01:20.410
and some oil and vinegar on the meat, but not on the bun.

01:20.480 --> 01:21.800
I hate when it gets soggy.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.690
What part of "my first day" did you not get?

01:25.860 --> 01:26.630
I'll take a ham and cheese.

01:26.710 --> 01:27.550
Coming right up!

01:28.320 --> 01:30.130
One ham and cheese...

01:30.160 --> 01:32.790
Oh. Oh, no wait,  that's not even.

01:33.460 --> 01:38.400
OK. Alright, lets see. OK. Closer, but not good enough.

01:39.440 --> 01:40.640
It doesn't have to be perfect.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.640
You know what? You're absolutely right.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.370
But this one is! Oh wait, hang on.

01:46.380 --> 01:47.580
OK, perfect!

01:47.610 --> 01:51.450
Now two slices of ham. One, two...

01:51.480 --> 01:52.980
Oh, hang on, it's hanging over.

01:53.150 --> 01:54.220
Is there anyone else who can help me?

01:54.550 --> 01:55.220
Oh, I'll be right with you.

01:56.590 --> 01:58.210
Come on. You can just shove the ham in there.

01:58.420 --> 01:59.660
Uh, it's not like that in the picture.

02:00.530 --> 02:02.500
You know I'm thinking this may be a defective bun.

02:02.570 --> 02:03.270
Oh, come on!

02:03.380 --> 02:04.690
Hey! Back off. It's her first day.

02:05.970 --> 02:07.650
-Just shove the ham in.  -Fine.

02:08.229 --> 02:12.630
OK, two slices of cheese...Oh, that is not right.

02:13.760 --> 02:15.170
My break's almost over.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.510
Let's go!

02:16.840 --> 02:18.540
Uh, what's going on out here?

02:18.570 --> 02:20.080
She's taking forever!

02:20.110 --> 02:21.440
Hey, I told you to back off!

02:21.680 --> 02:22.910
I can handle this, thank you.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.050
She'll be right with you. Just make the sandwich!

02:25.080 --> 02:27.220
OK, fine! I mean, you're the boss!

02:27.250 --> 02:28.580
Who cares what it looks like?

02:29.190 --> 02:31.450
Forget about quality, forget about pride in your work,

02:31.490 --> 02:33.520
just mash it together!

02:33.660 --> 02:35.520
There! There's my  first sandwich.

02:35.560 --> 02:38.530
- Take a picture of that!  - Thank you.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.500
No no no! It's hideous!

02:40.530 --> 02:41.800
Don't wrestle with the customer!

02:42.100 --> 02:43.670
It's my first sandwich!

02:48.390 --> 02:49.410
And your last!

02:49.840 --> 02:51.600
But I was saving up for a car.

02:52.500 --> 02:52.850
Fine.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.490
You can keep your tips.

You get the limo out front

03:18.200 --> 03:21.460
Hottest styles. Every shoe, every color

03:21.790 --> 03:24.830
Yeah, when you're famous, it can be kind of fun

03:25.540 --> 03:29.590
It's really you but no one ever discovers

03:30.320 --> 03:33.110
Who would have thought that a girl like me

03:33.750 --> 03:38.690
Would double as a superstar

03:39.910 --> 03:43.650
You get the best of both worlds

03:43.790 --> 03:45.430
Chill it out Take it slow

03:45.460 --> 03:47.200
Then you rock out the show

03:47.230 --> 03:51.360
You get the best of both worlds

03:51.360 --> 03:53.870
Mix it all together and you know

03:53.900 --> 03:56.840
That it's the best of both worlds

03:58.480 --> 04:01.140
Hannah Montana  S03E27  Got To Get Her Out Of My House

04:04.110 --> 04:06.980
Hey, girls! Lilly, how was your first day on the job?

04:09.960 --> 04:13.240
I mean, I hear you and Oliver are saving up to buy a new car.

04:16.220 --> 04:17.550
OK, who wants a ham and cheese?

04:22.860 --> 04:25.170
I'm sorry honey, he came with the house.

04:26.490 --> 04:28.780
Don't worry, we'll get you another job.

04:28.950 --> 04:30.940
I applied for thirty before I got this one.

04:30.940 --> 04:33.980
And the only reason I got it was because my dumb boss

04:34.010 --> 04:37.780
had a grandmother named Lilly and I totally used it.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.420
"Oh, land sake's alive,

04:40.450 --> 04:44.240
aren't you adorable. Here's my application."

04:44.910 --> 04:47.090
Oh! My eyes!

04:48.710 --> 04:49.440
What was that?!

04:50.340 --> 04:52.890
I think the new housekeeper just found Jackson's room.

04:53.980 --> 04:54.880
The horror!

04:55.870 --> 04:56.870
The horror!

04:58.380 --> 05:00.850
Aw, c'mon buddy, you were a Navy Seal.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.120
You ain't gonna let a little dirt scare ya off, are ya?

05:03.400 --> 05:07.010
I took out my own appendix with a wet wipe,

05:07.040 --> 05:09.110
dental floss and a rusty spoon

05:09.150 --> 05:10.710
and I never shed a tear.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.540
But that room.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.320
I gotta sleep with the lights on tonight.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.170
That's it!

05:22.640 --> 05:26.110
Another brave one bites the dust. This ends now.

05:31.370 --> 05:32.370
There you are.

05:39.870 --> 05:43.440
Oh, sweet filthy flippin' niblets son,

05:43.440 --> 05:45.280
all we need is a tire on a swing

05:45.310 --> 05:48.250
and I could sell tickets to see The Malibu Monkey Boy!

05:49.290 --> 05:50.690
Listen, you're in college now,

05:51.250 --> 05:54.080
it's time to start thinking, acting and living like an adult.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.790
- Jackson?   - Oh...

05:59.710 --> 06:00.310
...sorry, Dad.

06:00.630 --> 06:02.360
I was just thinking about how cool it'd be

06:02.600 --> 06:04.800
if I really were half man and half monkey.

06:04.830 --> 06:06.090
I mean, check it out.

06:08.740 --> 06:10.110
I'd have a driver's license,

06:10.890 --> 06:12.960
and I'd be able to drive with my feet!

06:13.640 --> 06:16.090
Hey, you, get out of the way!

06:18.950 --> 06:21.040
You just love to test me, don't you, big guy?

06:27.540 --> 06:30.600
Come on, Dad. We'll find another housekeeper.

06:30.760 --> 06:31.730
Son, that's the fifth one

06:31.730 --> 06:33.760
that's ran screaming out of the house this year!

06:33.860 --> 06:35.730
You think it's so easy, you find one.

06:36.390 --> 06:36.950
I'll do it.

06:37.680 --> 06:38.720
What?

06:39.970 --> 06:41.290
Great, you're hired.

06:41.800 --> 06:42.440
You're welcome.

06:43.230 --> 06:43.980
And you're ugly.

06:45.370 --> 06:47.080
- Dummy say what?  - What?

06:47.110 --> 06:48.300
Heh! Dummy.

06:49.260 --> 06:51.480
Are you sure you wanna be a housekeeper?

06:51.750 --> 06:52.880
Well, it's not my first choice,

06:53.090 --> 06:55.580
but if Oliver and I are gonna buy a car, I need a job.

06:55.620 --> 06:56.190
But Lilly,

06:56.190 --> 06:58.120
won't it be a little strange cleaning up after us?

06:58.590 --> 06:59.890
Why not? I mean, I'm here all the time anyway,

06:59.920 --> 07:01.320
I know where everything goes.

07:01.860 --> 07:02.590
It's true.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.430
And Dad, let's face it, I mean,

07:04.460 --> 07:06.630
she's the only housekeeper that we're gonna find

07:06.660 --> 07:08.630
that's already immune to Jackson stank.

07:08.660 --> 07:10.950
See? Her eyes don't even water anymore.

07:12.740 --> 07:14.260
Honey, please don't stir it up!

07:16.250 --> 07:16.770
So, are you cool with it?

07:17.040 --> 07:18.770
Honey, if it gets the sting outta my eyes,

07:18.810 --> 07:20.710
she can have your grandmother's wedding ring.

07:26.050 --> 07:28.930
...yeah, but I really need this job. You know, you see,

07:29.930 --> 07:30.890
Me and my girlfriend are trying to buy a car together and...

07:31.670 --> 07:33.400
OK, well can you put me on the waiting list?

07:34.890 --> 07:37.230
Fantastic! OK, thank you.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.690
How's the job search going?

07:40.050 --> 07:42.300
Great! If 32 people ahead of me all win the lottery,

07:42.330 --> 07:43.800
you're lookin' at the new scooper

07:43.800 --> 07:45.750
trainee at Yippy Yummy Yogurt

07:47.170 --> 07:49.040
Don't worry, buddy. Just keep your eyes open.

07:49.580 --> 07:52.670
You never know when a job will just pop up.

07:53.740 --> 07:57.280
Oh, excuse me while I move my New Jackson Wanted sign

07:57.310 --> 08:00.480
to where some lucky potential employee might see it.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.020
Oh, I'm not working for you.

08:06.290 --> 08:07.030
Why not?

08:07.340 --> 08:09.110
For the same reason no one wants to work for you

08:09.110 --> 08:10.890
ever since Jackson quit for college.

08:11.140 --> 08:12.910
Rico, you're a horrible person.

08:13.170 --> 08:14.530
That is so not true.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.000
Excuse me,

08:16.500 --> 08:17.870
I only have 99 cents,

08:18.230 --> 08:19.970
but could I get the dollar bottle of water?

08:20.330 --> 08:22.040
Who do I look like, the water fairy?

08:23.010 --> 08:24.940
You need a penny, sell your hair!

08:28.440 --> 08:32.250
Cute little guy. So, when you wanna start?

08:33.480 --> 08:34.650
Ah, forget it.

08:35.450 --> 08:37.179
But, Oliver, you have to.

08:37.929 --> 08:39.450
If you don't, I'll have to face my girlfriend,

08:39.980 --> 08:41.490
tell her I can't afford my half of the car,

08:41.870 --> 08:44.090
I'm a complete loser and...

08:44.410 --> 08:48.240
Oh, wait, that's not me, that's you.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.960
You're despicable.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.100
Welcome aboard.

09:00.180 --> 09:03.480
Who's the cleanest plant in Malibu? You are! Yes, you are!

09:09.890 --> 09:11.590
- Whoa.  - Oh my gosh.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.010
Lilly, this place looks amazing!

09:19.010 --> 09:19.860
It's OK?

09:19.900 --> 09:21.260
Are you kidding me?

09:21.860 --> 09:25.420
Lulu! She smells so lemony fresh!

09:25.600 --> 09:27.660
And the couch! It doesn't smell so...

09:29.530 --> 09:31.070
...Jacksony ripe!

09:31.950 --> 09:32.840
Lilly, I love you!

09:32.880 --> 09:34.840
Oh, well I'm just doing my job.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.750
Oh, Mr. Stewart, I hope you don't mind,

09:36.780 --> 09:38.420
when I cleaned your bathroom,

09:38.530 --> 09:41.320
I reorganized all your hair products in order of application

09:41.350 --> 09:42.950
from a pre-rinse to shampoo to...

09:43.120 --> 09:44.850
- Volumizing mousse?  - Volumizing mousse.

09:44.890 --> 09:46.020
Oh, yeah!

09:46.480 --> 09:47.490
If you ladies will excuse me,

09:47.520 --> 09:48.820
I'm gonna go shampoo now.

09:52.780 --> 09:55.880
I gotta admit, I was kinda worried about the whole thing,

09:55.890 --> 09:57.210
but it's working out perfectly.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.020
What?

10:00.240 --> 10:03.280
Well, it's just that, you know, things look so nice,

10:03.390 --> 10:06.040
and then the purse and the scarf...

10:06.080 --> 10:08.370
No, no. It's fine! It's your house.

10:08.460 --> 10:09.140
You should be comfortable.

10:09.980 --> 10:10.480
Cool.

10:14.580 --> 10:15.160
Now what?

10:15.380 --> 10:17.190
Well, it's just umm...

10:17.490 --> 10:19.690
...you know, the cushions were plumped...

10:19.720 --> 10:20.500
No, you know, it's fine!

10:20.560 --> 10:23.040
I'll just clean it all over again on Thursday.

10:23.930 --> 10:25.310
What happened to "I should be comfortable?"

10:26.090 --> 10:27.250
You're right, I'll stop.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.660
Let me just get those Hannah hairs

10:30.730 --> 10:32.800
before they wind up on my clean rug.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.470
Yeah, that would be tragic.

10:38.230 --> 10:38.880
Oh, yes!

10:43.410 --> 10:45.020
Movie time!

10:54.360 --> 10:55.470
Ooh, butter.

10:57.420 --> 10:59.130
"Ooh, butter" what?

11:00.700 --> 11:04.770
It's just, you know, butter, it's a stain waiting to happen.

11:04.950 --> 11:06.720
A grease stain! Oh, they're the worst.

11:08.860 --> 11:09.640
And I don't care.

11:10.650 --> 11:11.330
Good girl.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.630
Leave extra time to scrub couch.

11:17.710 --> 11:20.320
And clothes I just washed today.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.750
Fine. I won't eat the popcorn.

11:40.180 --> 11:40.900
Happy?

11:47.220 --> 11:48.410
This isn't working!

11:50.820 --> 11:53.900
Well, maybe if you ate in the kitchen like a person.

11:55.170 --> 11:58.610
Look, although you are an unbelievable housekeeper,

11:58.970 --> 12:01.530
maybe Dad was right. Maybe you working for us is kind of,

12:01.850 --> 12:02.780
I don't know, strange.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.300
- Oh, not for me. - Really?

12:04.560 --> 12:05.490
- Really. - Really?

12:05.660 --> 12:07.170
Unless you have a problem with it.

12:07.180 --> 12:08.630
Because I mean I totally need this job.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.070
No! It's not me.

12:14.140 --> 12:14.740
It's my dad!

12:15.440 --> 12:17.870
He's actually just not as happy as he made you think.

12:18.370 --> 12:19.570
Ah!

12:25.010 --> 12:26.210
Bless you, Lilly.

12:26.630 --> 12:28.150
He's way happier.

12:33.530 --> 12:34.620
I mean look at this!

12:34.880 --> 12:38.400
I forgot he even had a floor! And this chair!

12:38.760 --> 12:40.580
I thought we lost it in the move.

12:41.390 --> 12:43.200
Yeah, I didn't even see it at first, either.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.050
I mean it was buried under pizza so old

12:45.050 --> 12:46.890
there were mushrooms growing out of the mushrooms.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.590
Lilly Truscott, I'm giving you a raise!

12:49.820 --> 12:50.830
Thank you, Mr. Stewart!

12:50.840 --> 12:53.320
Uh, new car here I come! Isn't that great, Miley?

12:53.410 --> 12:54.400
Super!

12:58.910 --> 13:00.350
My room!

13:00.380 --> 13:02.120
Oh, you're welcome.

13:02.150 --> 13:04.290
For what? It's horrible!

13:05.270 --> 13:07.780
Where's my petrifiedsweat sock sculpture?

13:08.230 --> 13:09.960
Where's Mashed Potato Mountain?

13:10.420 --> 13:13.220
Where's... Hey, I thought we lost that chair in the move.

13:14.100 --> 13:15.630
Hey, you got any advice

13:15.830 --> 13:17.920
for getting the burnt crusty pork off my barbecue?

13:18.000 --> 13:18.730
- Too late!  - You didn't.

13:18.770 --> 13:20.170
I did!

13:20.200 --> 13:22.530
Yeah. She probably even dusted the charcoal.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.610
I even dusted the charcoal! Come see!

13:25.140 --> 13:26.370
I'm gettin' my camera!

13:26.410 --> 13:27.940
- I cleaned the lens!  - You didn't!

13:27.980 --> 13:29.840
- I did!   - Oh!

13:29.880 --> 13:32.850
Socks in drawers,

13:32.880 --> 13:36.820
shirts on hangers, it's madness!

13:36.850 --> 13:38.390
I can't live like this.

13:38.970 --> 13:41.540
That neat freak has to go!

13:42.460 --> 13:46.190
You know, I don't really want to say this but, you're right.

13:46.660 --> 13:51.400
Ow, that actually hurt. But she does need a job.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.470
So just get her her old job back.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.640
Yeah, like I could...

13:55.670 --> 13:58.980
Actually, Jackson, that's a great idea.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.780
Ow, two in a row.

14:07.010 --> 14:09.660
Here you go and thank you for choosing Rico's.

14:11.650 --> 14:14.290
Three cheers for the generous tipper! Hip-hip...

14:14.320 --> 14:16.060
- Hey-o!  - Hip-hip...

14:16.090 --> 14:17.960
- Hey-o!   - What are you doing?

14:17.990 --> 14:19.560
Oh, we're cheering on the tipper.

14:19.730 --> 14:20.760
It's a crowd pleaser. Watch this.

14:20.800 --> 14:21.900
Hip-hip...

14:21.930 --> 14:23.330
Hey-o!

14:24.900 --> 14:26.200
You see that?

14:29.040 --> 14:30.340
OK, first,

14:30.370 --> 14:35.380
I own the exclusive North American rights to the "hey-o!"

14:36.480 --> 14:38.410
Second, why are you happy?

14:39.050 --> 14:42.120
You're not supposed to be happy! You work for me!

14:43.040 --> 14:44.890
You know what? It's not so bad.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.390
I mean I'm on the beach all day, everyone's friendly,

14:48.420 --> 14:50.430
and every hour that I'm working for you,

14:50.460 --> 14:52.740
I'm an hour closer to getting my new car.

14:54.790 --> 14:56.600
I don't like your attitude, mister.

14:58.170 --> 15:00.870
Jackson was miserable every minute he was here

15:00.950 --> 15:01.820
and I loved it.

15:02.070 --> 15:05.670
Oh, seeing his pain was like waking up on Christmas morning

15:05.710 --> 15:08.380
to find all those presents under the tree.

15:08.410 --> 15:09.880
Where are my presents?!

15:09.910 --> 15:11.080
I want my presents!

15:11.110 --> 15:12.550
I don't know!

15:12.580 --> 15:17.120
Sorry to disappoint you man, but I like this job.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.690
Oh, we'll see about that!

15:19.720 --> 15:22.460
Because I will have my Christmas morning!

15:23.270 --> 15:24.910
Mwah-hah-hah-hah!

15:26.030 --> 15:27.830
I own that, too.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.530
Oh, you missed some bird poop over there.

15:33.570 --> 15:36.170
Oh, cool. Hey, thanks Rico.

15:38.470 --> 15:42.460
Oh, come on! What can you possibly like about this?

15:42.730 --> 15:45.880
I can see Lilly cleaning the Stewart's house from here.

15:45.910 --> 15:51.130
Hey, Lilly! She saw me! She saw me!

15:52.100 --> 15:53.470
She saw me!

15:53.470 --> 15:55.220
She did! She did! She's right there.

15:55.260 --> 15:57.260
I was mocking you!

15:57.290 --> 16:00.810
I know! And you're cute when you're mad!

16:01.800 --> 16:04.770
Well, I'm about to get adorable!

16:10.010 --> 16:12.790
Come to Rico's for good food

16:13.580 --> 16:15.740
It will brighten up your mood

16:15.780 --> 16:18.380
And if you think that I'm a fool

16:18.410 --> 16:21.480
Please tell everyone at school

16:27.090 --> 16:29.020
Why are you still happy?

16:29.060 --> 16:32.430
You're dressed as a penguin,  you're sweating like a pig.

16:32.460 --> 16:33.630
You should be miserable!

16:33.660 --> 16:34.900
Miserable?

16:35.030 --> 16:36.630
Dude, I just lost the last three pounds

16:36.800 --> 16:38.930
I needed to get in my skinny jeans.

16:40.470 --> 16:43.500
Now, when I say "foxy"  you say "penguin!" Foxy!

16:43.540 --> 16:44.940
- Penguin!  - Foxy!

16:44.970 --> 16:47.040
- Penguin! - Stop it!

16:50.350 --> 16:52.280
- Foxy! - Penguin!

16:52.310 --> 16:53.710
- Foxy! - Penguin!

16:53.820 --> 16:55.350
- Foxy!  -Penguin!

16:58.390 --> 17:00.590
Enjoy your meal.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.300
Uh, excuse me, sir. What are you doing?

17:09.329 --> 17:12.369
Sorry pal, this shop is closed.

17:14.369 --> 17:17.869
Here, why don't you go next door and get yourself

17:17.910 --> 17:20.910
a nice soup in a sourdough bowl.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.210
And if you hear any screaming

17:23.250 --> 17:25.609
emanating from this establishment,

17:25.650 --> 17:27.920
just eat your soup.

17:29.350 --> 17:31.130
Hey! That was my...

17:31.690 --> 17:32.710
But I could...

17:33.260 --> 17:34.210
I just...

17:36.760 --> 17:40.090
Yo, Adrian. We're good to go.

17:41.130 --> 17:42.860
Thanks, Fredo.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.670
Hello, Dwight. How you doin'?

17:47.700 --> 17:49.040
Do I know you?

17:49.070 --> 17:52.110
No, but I know youse.

17:52.140 --> 17:53.980
You are the deeply confused young man

17:54.010 --> 17:56.710
who mistakenly fired my little girl.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.010
Fredo, help our friend sit down.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.250
You're Lilly Truscott's mom?

18:03.290 --> 18:06.790
Incorrect, my friend.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.800
I'm her godmother.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.090
Not yet.

18:12.130 --> 18:14.230
You sure? That felt like the right place to throw that...

18:14.260 --> 18:16.230
- Fredo!  - Sorry, boss.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.130
He's one layer short of a lasagna

18:20.130 --> 18:21.170
if you know what I'm sayin'.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.600
Yeah, lasagna, that's good.

18:23.640 --> 18:24.870
That wasn't a joke.

18:24.910 --> 18:26.410
Sorry.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.210
Do I amuse you?

18:29.240 --> 18:32.580
Do you think of me as some kind of clown?

18:32.610 --> 18:35.220
Please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me...

18:35.250 --> 18:39.350
Relax, Dwight, there's no need to get hurt here.

18:39.390 --> 18:43.920
All you gotta do's is call Lilly and offer her her job back.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.660
But I'm not sure I can do that.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.960
Listen, I got a question for youse.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.630
Are you fond of your kneecaps?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.500
I said are you fond of your kneecaps?

18:53.540 --> 18:54.550
Sorry.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.500
My sister's kid. What are you gonna do?

19:01.210 --> 19:03.310
So, what's it gonna be?

19:03.350 --> 19:07.880
Lilly here or you taking a little walk with Fredo?

19:09.380 --> 19:10.550
Lilly?

19:11.550 --> 19:12.690
Good kid.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.460
Now you go call that girl

19:14.490 --> 19:17.290
and make her an offer that she can't refuse.

19:17.330 --> 19:21.160
And remembers, we were never here.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.300
- Never.  - OK.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.430
Badda bing?

19:26.470 --> 19:27.740
Badda boom.

19:27.770 --> 19:29.990
- Miley?  - Badda busted.

19:30.910 --> 19:32.250
What are you guys doing here?

19:32.320 --> 19:33.040
Just getting a sandwich.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.100
Dressed like that?

19:35.180 --> 19:38.350
Uh, I just came back from my uh...

19:38.380 --> 19:39.440
Uh, video shoot.

Called uh...

19:44.350 --> 19:46.620
Mobster Mama!

19:46.660 --> 19:48.220
Yeah, it's super cool.

19:49.110 --> 19:49.560
You should hear it.

19:49.660 --> 19:50.690
Why don't you sing her a little?

19:53.800 --> 19:55.800
I'm a mobster mama

19:55.830 --> 19:58.300
She's mean, she's tough She's a monster mama

19:58.330 --> 20:00.840
Don't make me get rough 'cause I can do my stuff

20:01.900 --> 20:03.240
Like Julianne Hough, hey!

20:03.270 --> 20:04.410
Break it down!

20:04.440 --> 20:05.470
Miley.

20:05.710 --> 20:06.200
Miley.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.380
Fine.

20:12.450 --> 20:16.950
The truth is... Dad was right.

20:16.990 --> 20:18.920
Having you work for us was a little ookie

20:18.950 --> 20:21.320
and we were just trying to get your job back.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.590
You're kidding! I came down here to get my job back

20:23.630 --> 20:25.190
'cause I felt the same way.

20:25.230 --> 20:26.430
Why didn't you tell me?

20:26.900 --> 20:30.030
I didn't want to hurt you. Really? Aw.

20:30.070 --> 20:32.230
Oh. This is so sweet

20:32.270 --> 20:36.100
it reminds me of my favorite  episode of <My Name is Hurl>.

20:38.510 --> 20:40.710
Well, I guess I better go try and get my job back.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.880
Oh, nope!

20:41.910 --> 20:44.380
That's already taken care of.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.650
And, think you're even gettin' a raise.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.950
- Really?   - Yo, Dwight!

20:48.980 --> 20:51.390
And I think you should give the girl a raise!

20:51.420 --> 20:53.250
Yes, Godmother!

20:53.290 --> 20:56.360
- Good boy!   - Thank you, Miley.

20:56.390 --> 20:58.890
Oh, you know what? I better call your dad.

20:58.930 --> 21:00.900
I'm already on it.

21:00.930 --> 21:02.430
I'm sure he'll be fine.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.330
He's a big boy. He can take care of himself.

21:04.370 --> 21:08.740
No, Jackson, no! She can't do this to me!

21:08.770 --> 21:12.440
Please, please, please, please!

21:17.080 --> 21:20.050
And it smells so fresh!

21:27.170 --> 21:29.540

You win. Your happiness has broken me.

21:42.550 --> 21:44.760
Now get out of my sight.

21:44.790 --> 21:46.620
Go back to your stupid girlfriend.

21:48.660 --> 21:51.030
What did you call Lilly?

21:51.060 --> 21:52.730
Stupid.

A dumb, pathetic...

Oh!

21:58.740 --> 22:01.370
...squeaky voiced loser.

- Come here!   - Dopey! Stinky!

22:09.650 --> 22:11.320
Whiny!
