00:02.203 --> 00:04.205
(Wu)
Previously on "Ninjago.."

00:05.506 --> 00:08.176
Time to make this place
a snake-free zone.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.277
That symbol.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.579
The next Time Blade has arrived.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.547
No!

00:15.216 --> 00:17.618
- What is that?
- Huh!

00:17.651 --> 00:20.221
(Lloyd)
'We got the Time Blade.
Let's get out of here.'

00:20.254 --> 00:23.357
* Jump up kick back

00:23.391 --> 00:25.459

* Jump up kick back

"Episode 70, The Attack."

00:48.149 --> 00:50.284
[instrumental music]

00:52.353 --> 00:54.788
Whoa! Amazing.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.658
It is unlike anything
I've ever seen.

00:57.691 --> 01:01.129
So cool.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.297
I must urge caution, Jay.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.166
The Time Blade
is a powerful weapon.

01:05.199 --> 01:08.169
Uh, you think I don't know that?
Check this.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.703
whoosh

01:09.737 --> 01:11.105
Boom! Ha ha.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.674
Eight bull's-eyes in a row,
beat that.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.310
- Oh, I did.
- Oh, really? When?

01:16.344 --> 01:18.246
When I got nine in a row. Huh.

01:18.279 --> 01:21.182
Okay, yeah, if you
want to count that.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.717
Yeah, but watch this.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.256
- Hyah!
- Ha ha, you missed.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.224
Did I?

01:31.825 --> 01:35.196
Slow moving target.
Easy peasy, lemon..

01:35.229 --> 01:38.166
Haiyah! Huh, hah, hyah, hi-yah.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.603
And that's how you recycle
an empty box.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.238
That box was not empty.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.439
[screaming]

01:47.475 --> 01:49.610
Mr. Cuddly Whomp.

01:49.643 --> 01:53.614
[sobbing]
Ahem, it's a teddy bear
I used to love

01:53.647 --> 01:56.550
when I was five, but now
he is totally lame and--

01:56.584 --> 01:58.819
We know you still
sleep with him.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.688
Uh, and I don't care
who knows it.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.623
[teddy bear squeaks]
Mr. Cuddly Whomp.

02:02.656 --> 02:05.226
Switching to playful mode.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.864
Hey, watch it, I'm workin' here.

02:10.898 --> 02:14.935
- Sorry, Nya.
- What's with Nya?

02:14.968 --> 02:17.571
She's been on her computer since
we got back from the desert.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.407
Her attempt to locate her stolen

02:19.440 --> 02:21.275
Samurai X suit
is consuming her.

02:21.309 --> 02:24.378
Uh, she's as bad
as her brother.

02:28.382 --> 02:32.152
[sighs]
Aha! I've got a clue.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.526
[grunts]

02:38.559 --> 02:39.627
'I haven't got a clue.'

02:39.660 --> 02:40.661
He has been reading those

02:40.694 --> 02:43.364
Ninjago history books all day.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.299
[scoffs]
I don't get those two.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.435
We finally get victory,
and they choose

02:47.468 --> 02:50.871
to celebrate by dorking out
instead of doing something cool?

02:50.904 --> 02:52.873
[gasps]
Let's run straight
at each other

02:52.906 --> 02:55.809
and see if this will slow us
down before we collide.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.245
[laughing]

02:57.278 --> 02:58.679
[teddy bear squeaks]

03:00.714 --> 03:02.316
I really think I'm starting
to get the hang

03:02.350 --> 03:03.817
of this whole master thing.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.220
So then I come storming
in on my jet

03:06.254 --> 03:08.689
maintaining a low altitude
for tactical benefits

03:08.722 --> 03:10.424
and I just completely overwhelm

03:10.458 --> 03:13.927
the Snake Army, samurai
fighter, whatever they are.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.864
You know, until they leapt into
our vehicles and crashed.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.400
Fast-forward,
the blade ends up in the sand

03:19.433 --> 03:20.468
and general what's-his-face..

03:20.501 --> 03:22.403
Lloyd dear

03:22.436 --> 03:23.937
'perhaps it would be
better to tell him'

03:23.971 --> 03:26.407
your amazing story when he can--

03:26.440 --> 03:29.310
Close your loop, slow all of
them down like a bunch of slugs

03:29.343 --> 03:33.914
and whoosh we fly out of there.
Pretty amazing, right?

03:33.947 --> 03:35.683
[snoring]

03:35.716 --> 03:38.819
- 'I'll make some more tea.'
- Mom?

03:38.852 --> 03:41.389
You lost the Time Blade.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.290
We had the Time Blade

03:42.323 --> 03:44.592
and now we do not have
the Time Blade.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.528
- Why?
- Because you dorks lost it.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.797
- To a bunch of kids.
- Kids.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.832
It was the Blue Ninja,
he came flying in

03:51.865 --> 03:53.934
on some weird superfast bike.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.536
I definitely want to get one.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.405
So I did
the whole time bubble thing.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.408
He did do the whole time bubble
thing, heh heh, so did I.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.276
You used the Time Blade?

04:02.310 --> 04:05.279
You were not given permission
to use the Time Blade.

04:05.313 --> 04:08.649
Because you do not know
how to use the Time Blade.

04:08.682 --> 04:13.387
'Cause if you knew how
to use the Time Blade

04:13.421 --> 04:15.389
you would not have lost
the Time Blade!

04:15.423 --> 04:16.590
Now that I think about it

04:16.624 --> 04:18.526
maybe we didn't use
the Time Blade.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.993
Yeah, I don't think we did.

04:20.027 --> 04:23.564
You used the Time Blade,
lose the Time Blade

04:23.597 --> 04:26.767
then lie about using
and losing the Time Blade.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.570
Okay, yes, true,
but we have come up

04:29.603 --> 04:30.538
with a way to get it back.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.740
We lure all the ninja
here by telling them

04:32.773 --> 04:35.609
we'll trade the blade
for Cyrus Borg.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.812
We need Cyrus Borg.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.549
Without his apparatus,
my plan won't work.

04:41.582 --> 04:46.587
Yeah, I-I know, um,
then we take the Time Blade

04:46.620 --> 04:48.556
and don't give them Cyrus Borg.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.624
Double-cross!

04:50.658 --> 04:54.628
Has it occurred to you
that if we do that

04:54.662 --> 04:56.464
the ninja will learn
the location

04:56.497 --> 05:00.501
of our secret headquarters,
see our master plan

05:00.534 --> 05:03.537
and try to take our blade?

05:03.571 --> 05:04.838
It has not.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.541
Furthermore,
we need all the Time Blades

05:07.575 --> 05:09.577
including the one you lost!

05:09.610 --> 05:10.811
This is your chance, Cyrus

05:10.844 --> 05:14.114
time for a little
industrial espionage.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.485
Are you sure
you want to cut those wires?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.720
They look rather important
for the apparatus

05:19.753 --> 05:21.589
to properly operate.

05:21.622 --> 05:26.360
The way lungs are important
for a human to properly operate.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.563
Okay, plan B. Hear me out.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.532
Operation Fudge Bomb.

05:31.565 --> 05:35.135
We just need 1000 gallons
of chocolate ice-cream or--

05:35.168 --> 05:38.539
Or a plan
that will actually work.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.973
You have my attention.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.677
Because of your BorgWatch's
temporal scanner..

05:43.711 --> 05:45.713
Regret heading that.

05:45.746 --> 05:49.082
We know the blade's location.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.686
Now, we just need to go
and get it.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.390
[intense music]

06:02.696 --> 06:03.931
Let's do this.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.999
Time Blade ready?

06:08.869 --> 06:11.439
[screaming]

06:15.676 --> 06:17.611
Faster, Jay.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.680
You're so slow, Cole--

06:19.713 --> 06:24.618
Hey, I told you guys not to mess
around with the Time Blade.

06:24.652 --> 06:28.689
We...aren't..

06:28.722 --> 06:31.191
[both groaning]

06:31.224 --> 06:32.626
- Ow!
- Ha ha!

06:32.660 --> 06:34.127
[laughing]

06:34.161 --> 06:35.996
I'd said to hide it
someplace safe.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.799
[clears throat]
And we ignored you.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.968
Besides, we're, um,
skill building.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.504
What skill?
Room destroying?

06:43.537 --> 06:46.607
This blade is extremely powerful
and highly coveted.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.610
Nothing this valuable
will be so easily conceded.

06:49.643 --> 06:52.780
[imitating Lloyd]
Nothing this valuable
will be so easily conceded.

06:52.813 --> 06:53.947
Sounds to me
like someone's earned

06:53.981 --> 06:55.849
his black belt
in being a wet blanket.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.651
What's that supposed to mean?

06:57.685 --> 07:00.454
I believe Cole's intent
is to describe you

07:00.488 --> 07:02.623
as the blanket
which has become wet.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.825
Not for the purposes
of puttin' out a fire

07:04.858 --> 07:07.094
but rather to extinguish
our enjoyment.

07:07.127 --> 07:07.928
Ugh!

07:07.961 --> 07:11.599
Oh, seriously, Lloyd,
lighten up.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.534
It's not going anywhere.

07:13.567 --> 07:14.868
Ugh! Hey!

07:14.902 --> 07:17.638
[laughs]
Ahem! See?

07:17.671 --> 07:19.973
I see that after victory

07:20.007 --> 07:23.010
some of you have chosen
to amuse yourselves.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.212
I encourage you
not to be so careless.

07:25.245 --> 07:29.583
'Nothing this valuable
will be so easily conceded.'

07:30.851 --> 07:32.953
Uh, sorry, Master Wu.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.555
Well put, master.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.023
Ah, well put?

07:36.056 --> 07:39.126
I just said the exact
same thing! Ugh!

07:39.159 --> 07:44.064
Kai, Nya, join.
This is important.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.836
You have had a victory,
a well-earned one

07:48.869 --> 07:52.773
but Krux, Acronix and their
forces remain a threat.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.777
'Do not allow your confidence
to cloud your vigilance.'

08:00.180 --> 08:02.683
I made that mistake once.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.595
Kai, is something troubling you?

08:14.628 --> 08:19.767
Uh, the marking on this helmet,
do you recognize it?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.935
[gasps]

08:21.969 --> 08:23.236
You do recognize it.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.806
W-what do you know?
Tell me, please.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.675
This means..

08:29.743 --> 08:31.178
This changes everything.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.251
What was that?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.929
[indistinct chanting]

09:01.675 --> 09:03.944
I've run
a fourth level analysis

09:03.977 --> 09:05.078
it appears the snake warriors

09:05.112 --> 09:06.580
have returned
to retrieve the blade.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.981
Really?
I could have told you that

09:08.015 --> 09:09.817
with a third level analysis.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.885
Or a no level analysis.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.186
We-we're all the way up here

09:13.220 --> 09:14.955
and they're all the way
down there.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.290
No chance they could reach us.

09:18.358 --> 09:21.929
Oh, come on, they got catapults?

09:21.962 --> 09:23.931
Whatever, it's just
a bunch of snakes.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.099
Remain on guard, ninja.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.868
There is more
to your adversaries

09:27.901 --> 09:30.037
than you may think.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.873
thud

09:32.906 --> 09:35.843
Uh, whatever, they're
just a bunch of warriors.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.912
I mean, they're not armed,
but we are.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.247
[chuckles]
Big mistake.

09:40.280 --> 09:43.016
Never bring fist
to a nunchak sword

09:43.050 --> 09:45.118
psychotonish shuriken fight.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.989
[dramatic music]

09:50.658 --> 09:53.193
Oh, wow!
They went from unarmed snakes

09:53.226 --> 09:55.796
to fully weaponized
vermillion warriors

09:55.829 --> 09:56.930
really, really fast.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.799
Doesn't matter.
We can take..

09:58.832 --> 10:01.001
Wait,
that's what they are called?

10:01.034 --> 10:03.036
Vermillion warriors?

10:03.070 --> 10:05.005
[chuckles]
I know, right? So lame.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.807
There are so many better names.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.276
Actually,
the name is quite clever.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.944
You see,
vermillion is a shade of red

10:10.978 --> 10:13.180
'with a slight orange tint.'

10:13.213 --> 10:16.650
A color which symbolizes
life in eternity.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.119
So in that sense, they should
actually be commended for--

10:19.152 --> 10:22.055
Guys, focus.
Everyone ready?

10:22.089 --> 10:25.092
I will sit this one out
to preserve my strength.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.994
Good idea, master.

10:27.027 --> 10:30.163
Ninjago!

10:33.033 --> 10:35.268
[cheering]

10:39.372 --> 10:42.342
- Great plan, General Machia.
- Yeah.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.779
It took the ninja, what,
three seconds to defeat them?

10:45.813 --> 10:48.716
See, this is what happens
when you put her in charge--

10:48.749 --> 10:51.384
That was nearly the first salvo.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.822
Next, we bring in the big boy.

10:56.890 --> 11:01.028
Okay, that was a lot easier
than I thought.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.830
Awesome work, everyone.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.966
[panting]
Now can you tell me
what that marking means?

11:05.999 --> 11:08.769
Yes. You must know that.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.670
[dramatic music]

11:14.107 --> 11:15.709
We have another concern.

11:15.743 --> 11:19.112
No, I do not like
where this is headed.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.681
[laughs]
The big boy.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.187
[all grunting]

11:29.890 --> 11:31.358
[groans]

11:35.128 --> 11:36.129
[screaming]

11:36.163 --> 11:38.165
[groans]

11:38.198 --> 11:39.032
Hey, Nya, do you remember

11:39.066 --> 11:41.168
our old babysitter,
Mrs. Grumiller?

11:41.201 --> 11:42.870
The mean one
with the mole on her..

11:42.903 --> 11:44.805
Yeah. Do you remember
what we used to do

11:44.838 --> 11:46.106
when she made us go to bed
early?

11:46.139 --> 11:47.207
Of course.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.977
[groaning]

11:51.178 --> 11:52.913
[sighs]

11:52.946 --> 11:56.149
Hey, you!
It's not my bedtime!

11:56.183 --> 11:58.118
[grunts]

11:58.151 --> 11:59.820
Wooh!

11:59.853 --> 12:02.489
'Cause I've still got
plenty of energy.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.327
But it's lights out for you.

12:09.029 --> 12:09.797
Oh, man!

12:09.830 --> 12:12.199
Whatever they paid
Mrs. Grumiller

12:12.232 --> 12:14.101
wasn't nearly enough.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.103
[panting]
'Come on!'

12:16.136 --> 12:18.772
We can use Destiny's Bounty
to fly above all this

12:18.806 --> 12:21.141
and get a good view
of the others position.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.847
(Jay)
Oh, no!

12:26.880 --> 12:28.381
- Or not.
- What?

12:28.415 --> 12:30.217
(Jay)
'No-no-no!'

12:33.120 --> 12:37.324
Overwhelming force, do not stop
until the mission is complete.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.193
[gasps]

12:42.029 --> 12:43.496
[snakes hissing]

12:47.968 --> 12:49.236
Oh, hello.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.304
Hah!

12:52.239 --> 12:53.841
Tea?

13:01.248 --> 13:03.116
Hyah!

13:03.150 --> 13:05.018
[dramatic music]

13:10.357 --> 13:11.825
We have to go on the offensive.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.426
They are bringing everything
up here.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.328
It means,
we have to go down there

13:15.362 --> 13:17.364
and take out their equipment.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.431
Uh, but how?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.834
Like this.

13:20.868 --> 13:24.204
Lloyd, I really don't think
going down there is a good idea.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.873
Especially on a dragon.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.008
In the past,
your fear has caused

13:28.041 --> 13:29.342
your dragon to vanish and--

13:29.376 --> 13:31.011
That was along time ago.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.380
- I am now a master.
- In training.

13:33.413 --> 13:37.250
And our temple is under attack!
I don't have time for fear.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.286
I'll take care of the ones
down below.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.854
You guys hold them off up here.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.056
And protect the Time Blade.

13:43.090 --> 13:47.260
[sighs]
You do have to admire
his unfounded moxie.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.263
[dragon growls]

13:54.301 --> 13:56.236
[music continues]

14:07.280 --> 14:08.548
Yes!

14:09.449 --> 14:11.018
Uh-oh!

14:18.558 --> 14:21.161
clink clink clink

14:21.194 --> 14:26.233
Ugh! The ninja are not
the only ones with air power.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.068
Sky team, go.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.504
[music continues]

14:37.477 --> 14:39.179
[evil laughter]

14:41.214 --> 14:43.350
Stay calm,
master in training.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.418
No time for fear.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.154
[screaming]

14:47.720 --> 14:48.388
Who-a-a!

14:48.421 --> 14:51.458
Lloyd, conjure the dragon again.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.626
I got this.

14:53.660 --> 14:56.296
[Lloyd screaming]

14:56.329 --> 14:58.198
Faster, faster.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.600
[Llyod screaming]

15:07.507 --> 15:09.042
Who-a-a!

15:15.382 --> 15:16.683
Oh, no, he's too far!

15:16.716 --> 15:18.952
[Lloyd screaming]

15:18.986 --> 15:22.422
Look, Nya was right,
the vermillion warriors

15:22.455 --> 15:24.657
did steal her Samurai X suit.

15:24.691 --> 15:27.260
Oh, so not fair.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.661
[Llyod screaming]

15:30.330 --> 15:33.200
What is taking so long?

15:33.233 --> 15:34.501
A mere setback.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.669
A good general
changes her strategy

15:36.703 --> 15:39.306
to reflect the conditions
on the ground.

15:39.339 --> 15:44.111
A great one
uses every weapon at hand.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.413
Samurai X
just saved Lloyd's life.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.582
Woo-ho-ho!
Alright, that was..

15:49.616 --> 15:52.419
Highly illogical.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.155
So Samurai X is not one of them.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.657
Which means
Nya must be Samurai X again.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.092
Oh, for sure.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.660
She probably faked the whole
stealing thing

16:00.693 --> 16:02.095
to throw us off.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.465
- What are you guys looking at?
- Or not.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.601
Hey, you! Suit thief!

16:08.635 --> 16:10.370
You owe me an explanation.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.606
I have a right to know
who you are! Tell me!

16:13.640 --> 16:15.642
[chuckles]
I got this.

16:15.675 --> 16:20.513
Who...are...you?

16:21.648 --> 16:24.584
Huh. How did that not work?

16:24.617 --> 16:29.089
Well, samurai, whoever you are,
thank you.

16:29.122 --> 16:34.427
Thank you? Samurai
whoever-you-are stole my suit!

16:34.461 --> 16:36.629
Yeah, and saved my life.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.332
I get that, and we are all
incredibly grateful

16:39.366 --> 16:44.437
really it's just...ugh!
You stole my stuff!

16:44.471 --> 16:45.772
clang

16:48.641 --> 16:50.477
- 'No-o-o!'
- 'No-o-o!'

16:50.510 --> 16:52.579
(all)
No-o-o!

16:52.612 --> 16:54.247
(Wu)
Ninja, ugh!

16:54.614 --> 16:57.484
[growling]

17:00.453 --> 17:02.589
Look what I found.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.394
[dramatic music]

17:10.330 --> 17:11.564
[grunts]

17:11.598 --> 17:14.267
- Thank you, Kai.
- You're welcome.

17:14.301 --> 17:17.604
Now please, master,
tell me about the marking.

17:17.637 --> 17:22.209
- What does it mean?
- Uh, yes, of course.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.644
- Your father--
- 'Time is up!'

17:28.481 --> 17:31.251
- The Hands Of Time.
- Get 'em.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.388
All we need are a few moments,
brother.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.056
Indeed.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.264
Huh?

17:45.698 --> 17:47.434
[groaning]

17:49.669 --> 17:52.205
- Goodbye.
- 'Master Wu!'

17:55.708 --> 17:57.444
Lucky old man.

17:57.477 --> 18:02.382
But your luck
is finally about to run out.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.719
Hyah!

18:06.753 --> 18:08.721
Hyah!

18:08.755 --> 18:10.790
I am too weak to fight.

18:10.823 --> 18:14.661
Restraint with this weapon,
but careful, Kai.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.863
[screaming]

18:17.897 --> 18:20.333
[grunting]

18:21.768 --> 18:24.304
[both grunting]

18:31.811 --> 18:33.213
Not so fast.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.282
Well, look at this.

18:35.315 --> 18:39.352
A child pretending
to be a big brave hero.

18:39.386 --> 18:43.290
Underestimating my fighting
skills is a mistake.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.826
Says the boy
who fell off his dragoon.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.661
Hyah!

18:53.866 --> 18:56.536
Zane, Cole, Nya, look out!

19:01.708 --> 19:02.842
[groans]

19:02.875 --> 19:05.178
See you soon, boy.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.649
[grunts]

19:14.887 --> 19:16.223
Ice!

19:19.759 --> 19:21.661
(all)
Whoa-a-a!

19:22.829 --> 19:25.232
[grunts]

19:26.999 --> 19:28.901
[evil laughter]

19:28.935 --> 19:31.504
[grunts]

19:34.841 --> 19:36.643
clang

19:41.614 --> 19:44.284
Lloyd, Wu, they need my help.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.386
[dramatic music]

19:48.688 --> 19:50.357
thud

19:57.964 --> 20:00.733
[music continues]

20:04.804 --> 20:05.938
Kai!

20:16.449 --> 20:21.288
[grunts]
Easy, boy.
Ninjago shall be ours!

20:21.321 --> 20:25.658
No, I won't. You..

20:25.692 --> 20:27.494
Aah!

20:28.961 --> 20:31.431
[screaming]

20:31.464 --> 20:32.765
[groans]

20:35.935 --> 20:37.604
[all cheering]

20:37.637 --> 20:41.374
Sorry, but it's gonna be pretty
hard to control Ninjago

20:41.408 --> 20:45.778
'when you have absolutely
none of the Time Blades.'

20:45.812 --> 20:47.514
[cheering]

20:48.915 --> 20:51.918
(Wu)
Do not be blinded by pride,
ninja.

20:51.951 --> 20:55.322
Now is the time
for the greatest vigilance.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.357
[dramatic music]

20:59.726 --> 21:01.994
Ninja, look out!

21:07.900 --> 21:09.068
Oh, no!

21:09.101 --> 21:11.037
Oh, yes.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.472
As I promised

21:12.505 --> 21:14.941
the Time Blades
are yours to keep.

21:14.974 --> 21:18.611
Indeed, and let's also take him!

21:19.446 --> 21:22.382
Brilliantly executed, Machia.

21:22.415 --> 21:25.418
Forward,
we are wasting precious time.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.656
Thank you for your hospitality.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.958
Wu! No!

21:37.129 --> 21:39.566
[grunts]

21:39.599 --> 21:42.535
Be strong, Wu, it isn't over.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.607
All that fighting..

21:47.640 --> 21:49.976
...just so we could end up
losing everything.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.713
Master Wu, both Time Blades.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.916
The Destiny's Bounty
and our temple.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.986
They beat us. They won.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.889
Even Samurai X
has been destroyed.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.593
Maybe not.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.461
(Llyod)
'They didn't win.'

22:09.996 --> 22:13.500
We lost
because we got over-confident.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.835
We've got to re-group.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.103
There are gonna pay.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.871
[grunts]

22:21.474 --> 22:22.942
The marking.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.621
[gasps]

22:36.188 --> 22:39.959
This changes everything.

22:42.429 --> 22:44.664
[theme music]
