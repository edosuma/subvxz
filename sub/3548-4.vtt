WEBVTT

00:00.571 --> 00:02.001
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.001 --> 00:03.703
WHEN HER FIRST HUSBAND DIED,

00:03.703 --> 00:06.407
BREE THOUGHT SHE WAS RID
OF HER MOTHER-IN-LAW.

00:06.407 --> 00:10.481
DANIELLE GOT PREGNANT,
AND BREE GOT CREATIVE.

00:10.481 --> 00:12.713
SOON THIS WHOLE CHARADE
WILL COMPLETELY UNRAVEL,

00:12.713 --> 00:16.487
AND WE WILL BE HUMILIATED.
 CARLOS AND GABY'S AFFAIR
TURNED DANGEROUS...

00:16.487 --> 00:18.489
IF SHE PULLED SOMETHING
LIKE THAT ON ME,

00:18.489 --> 00:22.053
THAT GUY WOULDN'T BE AROUND
FOR LONG.
 AND AN OLD NEIGHBOR RETURNED.

00:22.053 --> 00:25.156
I DIDN'T WANT POOR AUNT LILY
TO SPEND HER FINAL DAYS

00:25.156 --> 00:28.028
IN A NURSING HOME.
 THAT IS SO KIND OF YOU.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.136
(Mary Alice)
MRS. LILLIAN SIMS

00:35.136 --> 00:38.038
RETURNED TO WISTERIA LANE
ON A SATURDAY.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.112
AS SHE EMERGED
FROM THE AMBULANCE,

00:41.112 --> 00:43.114
IT OCCURRED TO HER

00:43.114 --> 00:47.078
THE NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKED
EXACTLY AS SHE HAD LEFT IT.

00:47.078 --> 00:49.650
SHE THEN DECIDED

00:49.650 --> 00:53.424
SHE SHOULD HAVE
PAINTED HER HOUSE BLUE.

00:53.424 --> 00:55.786
MOMENTS LATER,

00:55.786 --> 01:00.631
SHE WONDERED IF SHE WOULD
SEE HER HUSBAND IN HEAVEN.

01:00.631 --> 01:03.134
THESE ARE JUST
SOME OF THE THOUGHTS

01:03.134 --> 01:05.766
THAT GO THROUGH
AN OLD WOMAN'S MIND

01:05.766 --> 01:09.100
WHEN SHE COMES HOME TO DIE.

01:10.541 --> 01:12.603
(tinkling)

01:12.603 --> 01:14.605
NOW IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

01:14.605 --> 01:17.448
YOU JUST RING THIS LITTLE BELL,
AND I'LL COME RUNNING.

01:17.448 --> 01:20.551
I'M SORRY
TO BE SO MUCH TROUBLE.

01:20.551 --> 01:22.283
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,

01:22.283 --> 01:24.785
I-I WON'T BE A BURDEN
MUCH LONGER.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.388
OH, DON'T SAY THAT.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.460
THE DOCTORS SAY
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

01:29.460 --> 01:32.563
THAT YOU'LL BE WITH US
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

01:32.563 --> 01:35.796
I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME,
KATHERINE.

01:35.796 --> 01:38.629
YOU DON'T NEED TO LIE.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.433
AUNT LILY...

01:42.433 --> 01:43.604
MM.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.736
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?

01:45.736 --> 01:47.878
DYING, I MEAN.

01:47.878 --> 01:51.542
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

01:51.542 --> 01:54.215
I FEEL LUCKY.

01:54.215 --> 01:57.148
WHEN YOU KNOW
TIME IS RUNNING OUT,

01:57.148 --> 02:00.491
YOU--YOU GET A CHANCE
TO REFLECT ON YOUR LIFE.

02:02.553 --> 02:05.796
I-I REALLY DID TRY
TO LIVE A GOOD ONE.

02:05.796 --> 02:07.798
YOU DID MORE THAN TRY.

02:07.798 --> 02:10.461
GOD IS GOING TO WELCOME YOU
WITH OPEN ARMS.

02:10.461 --> 02:12.503
I'M NOT SO SURE.

02:12.503 --> 02:15.506
OH, WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

02:15.506 --> 02:19.470
I KEEP THINKING
ABOUT DYLAN...

02:19.470 --> 02:22.873
WHAT WE DID,
WHAT WE COVERED UP.

02:24.815 --> 02:26.817
WE DID WHAT WE HAD TO.

02:26.817 --> 02:29.350
WE SHOULD HAVE TOLD SOMEONE.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.622
WE COULDN'T. YOU KNOW THAT.

02:31.622 --> 02:33.354
IT--IT WAS A MISTAKE,

02:33.354 --> 02:36.687
AND IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO RECTIFY IT.

02:36.687 --> 02:38.759
YOUR LIFE MAY BE OVER,

02:38.759 --> 02:40.761
BUT THAT DOES NOT
GIVE YOU THE RIGHT

02:40.761 --> 02:42.763
TO GO AROUND
DESTROYING THE LIVES OF OTHERS.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.766
I CAN'T GO TO MY GRAVE
WITH THIS ON MY CONSCIENCE.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.768
PLEASE!
WE HAVE TO TELL THAT GIRL

02:47.768 --> 02:50.441
WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS ROOM.

02:50.441 --> 02:52.773
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.384
AS HER GUILT OVER THE PAST
BEGAN TO MOUNT,

03:03.384 --> 03:04.885
IT OCCURRED TO LILLIAN

03:04.885 --> 03:08.389
DEATH COULDN'T COME
QUICKLY ENOUGH.

03:08.389 --> 03:13.724
THIS THOUGHT
OCCURRED TO HER NIECE AS WELL.

03:22.933 --> 03:25.476
(horns honking)

03:25.476 --> 03:27.478
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS

03:27.478 --> 03:30.711
BOB HUNTER DISLIKED
ABOUT LIVING IN THE CITY,

03:30.711 --> 03:33.514
AND THE THING HE HATED MOST

03:33.514 --> 03:36.247
WERE THE PESTS--

03:36.247 --> 03:39.950
THE RATS
THAT LURKED IN THE ALLEYS...

03:39.950 --> 03:43.894
THE FLIES
THAT SWARMED THE GARBAGE...

03:43.894 --> 03:48.829
THE BUGS
THAT INVADED HIS CO-OP.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.831
I HAVE TRIED IT YOUR WAY...

03:50.831 --> 03:53.334
FINALLY, BOB INFORMED
HIS SIGNIFICANT OTHER

03:53.334 --> 03:55.806
IT WAS TIME...

03:55.806 --> 03:57.938
TO LEAVE THE CITY.

03:57.938 --> 04:01.572
SO THEY MOVED TO SUBURBIA,

04:01.572 --> 04:05.276
WHICH THEY QUICKLY DISCOVERED
HAD A FEW PESTS...

04:05.276 --> 04:06.577
HEY, NEIGHBOR!

04:06.577 --> 04:08.579
OF ITS OWN.

04:08.579 --> 04:10.981
OH, WE HAVEN'T
GOTTEN A CHANCE TO MEET.

04:10.981 --> 04:12.983
I'M SUSAN. I LIVE NEXT DOOR.
OH! (chuckles) JEEZ.

04:12.983 --> 04:15.986
HI. HI, I'M LEE.
 UH, I-I JUST WANTED
TO SAY HI.

04:15.986 --> 04:19.259
YOU KNOW,
I SAW THE MOVERS TAKING IN

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
SOME OF YOUR FURNITURE,
AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY

04:21.261 --> 04:23.263
YOU AND YOUR WIFE
HAVE GORGEOUS TASTE.
 (chuckling)

04:23.263 --> 04:25.265
NEED SOME HELP?
 YEAH,
LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.699
UM, I'M SUSAN.
I LIVE NEXT DOOR.
 OH, HI. I'M LEE'S PARTNER BOB.

04:28.699 --> 04:31.372
OH, YOU'RE PARTNERS.
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS?

04:31.372 --> 04:33.043
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IT IS,

04:33.043 --> 04:35.045
JUST DON'T LET
THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION

04:35.045 --> 04:37.047
HEAR THAT YOU
WORK OUT OF YOUR HOUSE.

04:37.047 --> 04:39.510
THEY'RE SO NOT COOL.
 ACTUALLY, WE'RE LIFE PARTNERS.

04:39.510 --> 04:40.811
OH.

04:40.811 --> 04:43.314
OH!(gasps)

04:43.314 --> 04:45.986
OH, THAT'S SUPER!
 (both laughing nervously)

04:45.986 --> 04:48.989
YEAH, I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CABLE,
SO I GET IT.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.061
(laughs) YOU'RE JUST GREAT.

04:51.061 --> 04:53.324
(chuckles) THANK YOU.

04:53.324 --> 04:55.626
I-I HOPE WE CAN LIVE UP
TO YOUR STEREOTYPE.

04:55.626 --> 04:57.798
(chuckles)

04:57.798 --> 04:59.299
OW.
 DON'T MIND HIM.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.432
HE'S JUST A LITTLE CRANKY
FROM, UH, ALL THE FRESH AIR.

05:01.432 --> 05:04.435
DO NOT APOLOGIZE FOR ME.
 LEE, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID

05:04.435 --> 05:06.637
MOVING HERE
WOULD BE BETTER FOR RAPHAEL.

05:06.637 --> 05:09.340
OH. SO THERE'S, UH...
THERE'S THREE OF YOU.

05:09.340 --> 05:12.843
(laughs)
WELL, THAT MUST BE...

05:12.843 --> 05:14.715
COZY.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.448
YES. WE'RE GAY MORMONS.

05:18.789 --> 05:20.891
SUSAN, UH...

05:20.891 --> 05:23.023
THAT'SRAPHAEL.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.825
(panting)

05:24.825 --> 05:26.597
OH. (laughs)

05:26.597 --> 05:29.560
RAPHAEL IS YOUR DOG,
OF COURSE.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.363
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE YOU FOLKS
CAN'T HAVE KIDS.

05:32.363 --> 05:35.536
I MEAN, UH, I MEAN,
OF COURSE YOUCANHAVE KIDS,

05:35.536 --> 05:37.538
UM, YOU--YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE TIMES HAVE CHANGED,

05:37.538 --> 05:39.640
AND NOW YOU'RE ALLOWED.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.972
UM...

05:43.844 --> 05:46.747
WHAT A... NICE DOG.

05:47.978 --> 05:51.021
I SHOULD GO.

05:51.021 --> 05:52.483
NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:52.483 --> 05:55.756
HEY, STOP BY ANY TIME, SUSAN--
OW! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.758
WHAT AREYOUDOING?
 WELL...

06:00.891 --> 06:02.393
(knocks on door)

06:05.396 --> 06:06.397
YES?

06:06.397 --> 06:08.669
I HAVE A DELIVERY
FOR DANIELLE VAN DE KAMP.

06:10.901 --> 06:15.145
CAN I GET YOU
TO SIGN HERE, PLEASE?

06:15.145 --> 06:17.147
(Andrew chuckles) OH!
 (door closes)

06:17.147 --> 06:20.080
IS THAT FOR US?
 NO, IT'S FOR DANIELLE.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.582
THERE YOU ARE.
THANK YOU.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.614
THAT'S ODD. WHO WOULD
SEND HER A SCOOTER?

06:23.614 --> 06:25.616
I KNEW IT!
PHYLLIS--REX'S MOTHER.

06:25.616 --> 06:27.117
EVER SINCE HE DIED,

06:27.117 --> 06:29.089
SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO BUY
THE CHILDREN'S AFFECTION.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.091
WOW. WELL,
IT'S A HONEY OF A BIKE.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.964
I'M SURE DANIELLE
WILL APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT.
 (raises kickstand)

06:33.964 --> 06:35.966
WELL,
I'M NOT GIVING IT TO HER.

06:35.966 --> 06:38.969
CAN YOU THINK OF A WORSE PRESENT
FOR A PREGNANT GIRL?

06:38.969 --> 06:41.401
WELL, I'M NOT KNOCKED UP.
LET ME HAVE IT.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.934
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT
2-WHEELED MOTORIZED VEHICLES.

06:43.934 --> 06:46.006
THEY'RE TOO DANGEROUS.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.879
WE'LL DONATE IT TO THE CHURCH.

06:48.879 --> 06:51.041
WHAT?!
 REVEREND SIKES SAID

06:51.041 --> 06:53.544
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ITEMS
FOR THE RAFFLE.
 SO WE'RE JUST GONNA
GIVE IT AWAY?

06:53.544 --> 06:56.046
WELL, IT'S BETTER THAN
YOU BREAKING YOUR NECK ON IT.

06:56.046 --> 06:58.949
MOM, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I WANT A SCOOTER. COME ON.

06:58.949 --> 07:01.421
YOU HEARD YOUR MOTHER.
WE'RE DONATING IT TO THE CHURCH.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.424
OF COURSE, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE
IT'S IN GOOD WORKING ORDER

07:04.424 --> 07:06.426
BEFORE WE DO THAT.
 (starts engine)

07:06.426 --> 07:08.959
NOT WITHOUT A HELMET.

07:08.959 --> 07:10.961
(shuts off engine)

07:14.705 --> 07:17.708
THIS BLOWS. ARE WE GONNA
LET HER DO THIS TO US?

07:17.708 --> 07:19.169
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:19.169 --> 07:23.143
IF WE WIN THAT RAFFLE,
WE'RE KEEPING IT.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.146
(humming)

07:27.678 --> 07:29.179
HEY.

07:29.179 --> 07:31.852
IT IS NICE
TO HEAR YOU HUMMING AGAIN.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.885
WELL, IT'S AMAZING WHAT
A WEEK WITHOUT CHEMO CAN DO.

07:34.885 --> 07:37.758
YEAH. WHEN DOES
THE LAST ROUND START?

07:37.758 --> 07:40.460
NEXT MONTH,
SO I HAVE SOME TIME

07:40.460 --> 07:42.763
BEFORE I START FEELING
LIKE TOTAL CRAP AGAIN.

07:42.763 --> 07:45.966
AND I WAS HOPING WE COULD
PUT THAT TIME TO GOOD USE.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.467
ARE YOU SURE?
 (kisses)

07:47.467 --> 07:49.469
I MEAN, THE DOCTOR SAID

07:49.469 --> 07:52.472
IT COULD BE MONTHS
BEFORE YOU GET YOUR MOJO BACK.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.745
WELL, IT'S BACK.

07:54.745 --> 07:56.907
AND SINCE WHEN
DO YOU QUESTION THE MOJO?

07:56.907 --> 07:59.580
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT. FORGIVE ME.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.913
OKAY,
SO HERE ARE YOUR OPTIONS.

08:02.913 --> 08:04.915
"A," WE COULD GO ROMANTIC,

08:04.915 --> 08:08.759
PLAY SOFT MUSIC,
LIGHT SOME CANDLES,

08:08.759 --> 08:11.922
OR "B," GO STRAIGHT
TO THE--WHOA!

08:11.922 --> 08:13.664
(laughs)

08:13.664 --> 08:15.666
(kisses)
 GOD, IT'S SO BEEN SO LONG.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.668
I HOPE I REMEMBER
HOW TO DO THIS.

08:17.668 --> 08:20.671
WELL, IT'S JUST LIKE RIDING
A BIKE. YOU NEVER FORGET.

08:20.671 --> 08:22.703
NOW START PEDALING.

08:24.535 --> 08:28.208
HEY. MMM.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.180
(moaning)

08:34.745 --> 08:38.288
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 OOH, SORRY.
I JUST MESSED UP YOUR HAIR.

08:38.288 --> 08:40.220
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIX IT.
 OW!

08:40.220 --> 08:42.722
SORRY. AL-ALMOST GOT IT.
 HEY! (laughs)

08:42.722 --> 08:44.695
WHOA. HEY.

08:44.695 --> 08:46.697
OH! (laughs)
 (chuckles nervously)

08:46.697 --> 08:48.228
SCREW IT.(laughs)

08:48.228 --> 08:51.231
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 OH, I RIPPED IT THIS MORNING.

08:51.231 --> 08:54.935
IT'S BEEN ITCHING
THE HELL OUT OF ME...
 (grunts)

08:54.935 --> 08:57.938
AND THIS IS MUCH BETTER.
 ARE YOU SURE YOU WANNA
TAKE THAT OFF, HONEY?

08:57.938 --> 09:01.011
I MEAN, WON'T YOU BE COLD?
 NO, I'M GOOD. MWAH!

09:01.011 --> 09:02.673
(grunts)
 (laughs)

09:04.845 --> 09:07.848
(kissing)

09:12.823 --> 09:15.826
HEY, BABE, WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU STILL WITH ME?

09:15.826 --> 09:19.289
YEAH. IT'S JUST--
IT'S KINDA...

09:19.289 --> 09:21.892
(grunts)
 WHAT?

09:21.892 --> 09:24.094
LATE. (grunts)

09:24.094 --> 09:26.997
(panting)

09:26.997 --> 09:28.669
IT'S 9:30.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.672
IT'S JUST THAT ONE OF OUR OVENS
BROKE DOWN TODAY,

09:31.672 --> 09:34.675
AND THE REPAIRMAN'S COMING
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,

09:34.675 --> 09:37.608
AND MAYBE I COULD RAVISH YOU...
TOMORROW.

09:39.850 --> 09:41.351
OH, OKAY.

09:54.324 --> 09:57.768
(Susan) COME ON, BREE.
YOU HAVE TO LET US DO THIS.
 UH, IT'S A LOVELY THOUGHT,

09:57.768 --> 09:59.770
BUT I REALLY DON'T WANT
A BABY SHOWER.

09:59.770 --> 10:01.772
WELL, I BOUGHT YOU
AN EXPENSIVE GIFT,

10:01.772 --> 10:05.075
AND I'M NOT GIVING IT TO YOU
UNLESS THERE'S A PARTY

10:05.075 --> 10:06.937
WITH PEOPLE WHO CAN SEE
HOW GENEROUS I AM.

10:06.937 --> 10:09.239
(Orson) BREE, WATCH THIS!
 (engine roaring)

10:09.239 --> 10:11.782
ORSON, I SAID BE CAREFUL!

10:13.113 --> 10:15.846
(sighs)
I JUST THINK IT'S TACKY

10:15.846 --> 10:18.849
TO HAVE A BABY SHOWER
WHEN IT'S NOT YOUR FIRST BABY.

10:18.849 --> 10:21.852
WELL,IDON'T SEE THE PROBLEM
WITH IT... HINT, HINT.

10:21.852 --> 10:24.695
YEAH, AND SHOWERS AREN'T JUST
ABOUT PRESENTS. THEY'RE FUN.

10:24.695 --> 10:27.397
AND WE CAN PLAY GAMES,
LIKE "HOW BIG IS MUMMY'S TUMMY?"

10:27.397 --> 10:29.259
EXCUSE ME?

10:29.259 --> 10:32.262
YEAH, WE GET A BALL OF YARN,
AND WE EACH CUT A PIECE

10:32.262 --> 10:35.265
THAT WE THINK IS JUST BIG ENOUGH
TO FIT AROUND YOUR STOMACH,

10:35.265 --> 10:38.268
AND THE ONE CLOSEST
WINS A PRIZE.

10:38.268 --> 10:40.811
IREALLYDON'T WANT
A SHOWER.

10:40.811 --> 10:43.814
(Orson) LOOK! LOOK AT ME!

10:43.814 --> 10:46.817
ORSON, JUST FIVE MORE MINUTES!
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GETTING!

10:46.817 --> 10:50.050
I TELL YOU WHAT. WHY DON'T WE
JUST SKIP THE SHOWER,

10:50.050 --> 10:53.123
AND AFTER THE BABY'S BORN,
I'LL HAVE A CHRISTENING PARTY?

10:53.123 --> 10:55.125
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

10:55.125 --> 10:57.427
(tires squeal, crash)

10:57.427 --> 11:00.330
(grunts) I'M OKAY! (laughs)

11:00.330 --> 11:02.192
I'M FINE.
 (trash can rattles)

11:02.192 --> 11:04.194
OH, DEAR GOD.

11:05.736 --> 11:08.398
(grunts)

11:08.398 --> 11:09.900
EXCUSE ME, LADIES.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.202
I-I COULDN'T HELP OVERHEARING

11:12.202 --> 11:14.204
YOU--YOU TALKING
ABOUT MY MOM'S SHOWER.

11:14.204 --> 11:17.778
I-I THINK I COULD BE
OF A LITTLE ASSISTANCE HERE.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.688
WHYDO YOU HAVE TO TAKE
OUR NEW NEIGHBORS COOKIE BARS?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.690
OH, LOOK, I MADE
A TERRIBLE FIRST IMPRESSION,

11:30.690 --> 11:33.363
SO I THOUGHT I'D MAKE THEM
SOME OF MY HOME-BAKED GOODNESS.

11:33.363 --> 11:35.365
(scoffs) BUT YOU DIDN'T
BAKE ANY GOODNESS.

11:35.365 --> 11:38.398
YOU JUST WARMED UP THE GOODNESS
I BOUGHT AT THE STORE.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.031
WELL, YEAH. I DON'T BAKE.
CATCH UP.

11:41.031 --> 11:43.403
YOU KNOW, NOT ALL NEIGHBORS
HAVE TO BE FRIENDS.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.405
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
LET IT GO?

11:45.405 --> 11:47.407
MIKE, THEY LIVE
15 FEET FROM US.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.409
IF WE HAVE A FIRE,
I WANNA BE SURE

11:49.409 --> 11:52.412
THAT THEY LIKE US ENOUGH
TO CALL 9-1-1.
 AH,THAT'STHE REAL REASON.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.915
YOU CAN'T STAND IT WHEN
SOMEBODY DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

11:54.915 --> 11:59.389
WELL, MAYBE.
 WELL, MAYBE BOB AND LEE JUST
LIKE TO KEEP TO THEMSELVES.

11:59.389 --> 12:02.322
THAT'S FINE,
AND ONCE THEY LIKE ME,

12:02.322 --> 12:05.425
THEY CAN KEEP TO THEMSELVES
ALL THEY DAMN WELL PLEASE.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.329
(knocks on door)

12:11.802 --> 12:13.804
HI. I WANTED TO BRING YOU

12:13.804 --> 12:15.966
A "WELCOME TO
THE NEIGHBORHOOD" PRESENT.

12:15.966 --> 12:18.508
YOU SHOULD TRY ONE WHILE THEY'RE
STILL WARM FROM THE OVEN.

12:18.508 --> 12:22.472
THAT WAS REALLY NICE. THANK YOU.
OH, ARE THERE NUTS IN THEM?

12:22.472 --> 12:24.474
NUTS?
 YEAH.

12:24.474 --> 12:26.877
GEE, LET ME THINK.

12:26.877 --> 12:28.378
NOPE, NO NUTS.

12:28.378 --> 12:30.981
ARE YOU SURE?
'CAUSE I'M HIGHLY ALLERGIC.

12:30.981 --> 12:32.983
HALF A PECAN COULD KILL ME.

12:39.229 --> 12:41.231
I'M NOT SEEING ANY NUTS.

12:41.231 --> 12:42.532
OKAY, YOU MADE THEM,

12:42.532 --> 12:46.867
SO DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT
PUT NUTS IN THEM?

12:46.867 --> 12:49.900
OKAY, HERE'S THE THING.
I'M A REALLY CRAPPY BAKER.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.472
TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING
THAT I MADE MYSELF

12:52.472 --> 12:55.475
WOULD BE LIKE AN INSULT, SO--
 SO--SO--SO YOU BOUGHT THEM,

12:55.475 --> 12:58.478
AND--AND THEN YOU HEATED THEM UP
IN ATTEMPT TO MAKE YOUR GESTURE

12:58.478 --> 13:00.780
SEEM MORE THOUGHTFUL
THAN, IN FACT, IT WAS.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.783
HEY, I WOULD'VE MADE THEM MYSELF
IF I KNEW HOW.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.555
HONESTLY,
I'M A GOOD NEIGHBOR.

13:05.555 --> 13:07.557
(laughs) YEAH, WELL, NEIGHBOR,
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE

13:07.557 --> 13:10.260
YOUR STORE-BOUGHT, WARMED-UP,
POSSIBLY POISONOUS COOKIE BARS

13:10.260 --> 13:12.222
AND GIVE THEM TO SOMEONE

13:12.222 --> 13:14.224
MORE LIKELY TO SURVIVE
YOUR GENEROSITY?

13:14.224 --> 13:16.827
DO YOU LIKE WINE?

13:16.827 --> 13:19.870
NO, NO, SO PLEASE DON'T BRING ME
A BOTTLE FROM YOUR VINEYARD.

13:25.575 --> 13:27.838
THIS RIP IS PRETTY BIG.

13:27.838 --> 13:29.509
IT'LL TAKE ABOUT A WEEK.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.381
AWEEK?

13:31.381 --> 13:34.184
ALL RIGHT.
YOU'LL HURRY IF YOU CAN?

13:36.086 --> 13:38.588
HONEY, IT'S OKAY.
YOU LOOK CUTE IN A SCARF.

13:38.588 --> 13:40.590
I'M UPSET
'CAUSE THAT SALESGIRL

13:40.590 --> 13:42.592
JUST WALKED AWAY
WITH MY SEX LIFE.

13:42.592 --> 13:45.595
WHAT?
 AFTER TWO MONTHS
OF PUKING MY GUTS OUT,

13:45.595 --> 13:47.597
LAST NIGHT
I WAS FINALLY IN THE MOOD,

13:47.597 --> 13:49.259
BUT TOM--NOT SO MUCH.

13:49.259 --> 13:52.262
APPARENTLY, MY BALD HEAD IS
A BIG TURNOFF FOR HIM. (scoffs)

13:52.262 --> 13:55.265
WHY'D YOU TAKE YOUR WIG OFF?
 IT WAS ITCHY.

13:55.265 --> 13:56.566
OKAY, NOT SMART.

13:56.566 --> 13:58.438
GABY, I AM HIS WIFE.

13:58.438 --> 13:59.870
HE'S SUPPOSED TO LOVEME--

13:59.870 --> 14:02.342
NOT MY BODY, ME...
MY--MY SOUL.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.844
WHY CAN'T HE MAKE LOVE
TO MY SOUL?

14:04.844 --> 14:06.176
INTERESTING.

14:06.176 --> 14:08.848
QUESTION--WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE IN THE BAR

14:08.848 --> 14:11.421
AND HEARD A GUY
TURN TO HIS FRIEND AND SAY,

14:11.421 --> 14:13.924
"HEY, CHECK OUT THE SOUL
ONTHATGIRL"?

14:13.924 --> 14:15.455
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

14:15.455 --> 14:17.457
I'M SAYING MEN ARE VISUAL.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.460
HELL, I HAVE A WHOLE CLOSET
FULL OF COSTUMES.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.934
YOU NEED TO GIVE TOM
SOMETHING TO LOOK AT,

14:23.934 --> 14:26.897
SOMETHING SPICY, LIKE...

14:26.897 --> 14:28.368
GABY, I'M NOT A REDHEAD.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.940
BUT YOU COULD BE,

14:29.940 --> 14:31.942
WHICH BRINGS ME
TO MY SECOND POINT--

14:31.942 --> 14:33.443
MEN LIKE VARIETY.

14:33.443 --> 14:35.575
TONIGHT YOU'RE A REDHEAD.
 (laughs)

14:35.575 --> 14:37.447
TOMORROW... YOU ARE...

14:37.447 --> 14:39.609
(imitates Swedish accent)
HELGA, THE SEXY MILKMAID.

14:39.609 --> 14:41.311
(normal voice) OR...

14:41.311 --> 14:43.984
(deeper voice)
AMBER, THE LONELY RUNAWAY.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.885
(normal voice) OR...

14:47.317 --> 14:49.589
JEFF, THE FRIENDLY GUY
FROM WORK.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.923
WHAT? I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TOM IS INTO.

14:52.923 --> 14:54.264
(chuckles)

14:54.264 --> 14:56.626
HMM.

14:56.626 --> 15:00.670
CLAUDE, YOU KNOW
I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU "HMM."

15:00.670 --> 15:04.334
EDIE...
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THIS?

15:04.334 --> 15:06.336
HAD WHAT?

15:06.336 --> 15:08.338
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

15:08.338 --> 15:11.111
I'M JUST HERE
FOR MY 5,000-MILE CHECKUP.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.113
WELL, YOU KNOW THAT BULLET

15:13.113 --> 15:15.615
YOU'VE MANAGED TO DODGE
ALL THESE YEARS?

15:16.987 --> 15:18.488
WHICH ONE?

15:18.488 --> 15:20.350
THE CLAP? THE HERP?

15:20.350 --> 15:21.651
THE SYPH?!

15:21.651 --> 15:23.353
CRABS?

15:23.353 --> 15:26.696
RELAX. I'LL BOIL
ALL THE SHEETS AND TOWELS,

15:26.696 --> 15:29.429
AND THEN WE'LL USE
THIS SPECIAL SHAMPOO,

15:29.429 --> 15:31.101
AND IN THREE DAYS,

15:31.101 --> 15:33.964
THE CROTCH CARNIVAL
PACKS UP AND LEAVES TOWN.

15:33.964 --> 15:36.366
OH, MAN.
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

15:36.366 --> 15:40.270
DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW I GOT 'EM.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.672
I USED THE TANNING BED
RIGHT AFTER MIMSY PORTER,

15:42.672 --> 15:44.214
THATSKANK.

15:44.214 --> 15:47.547
(sniffs) EW, IT SMELLS LIKE
BURNT LICORICE.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.549
WELL, COME IN THE BATHROOM,

15:49.549 --> 15:51.721
AND I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW TO USE THIS.

15:51.721 --> 15:53.653
(metal bristling)
 I THINK
I CAN FIGURE THAT OUT.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.656
YOU KNOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'RE
IN A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.359
OTHERWISE, WE'D HAVE TO MAKE
THAT CALL OF SHAME

15:59.359 --> 16:03.093
TO EVERYONE WE'VE BEEN WITH.
(sighs deeply)

16:04.594 --> 16:06.596
(Victor)
...YOU'VE HEARD ME MAKE BEFORE,

16:06.596 --> 16:08.598
BUT SOMETHING I FEEL
VERY, VERY STRONGLY ABOUT.

16:08.598 --> 16:10.600
FOR ME,
IT'S A VERY SIMPLE FORMULA.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.103
MORE DEVELOPMENT LEADS
TO AN INCREASED TAX BASE,

16:13.103 --> 16:15.745
WHICH HELPS BUILD SCHOOLS
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

16:15.745 --> 16:17.747
AROUND THE COUNTRY, THE NEEDS
OF CHILDREN ARE BEING...

16:17.747 --> 16:19.749
(whispering)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:19.749 --> 16:21.751
(whispering)
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

16:21.751 --> 16:23.753
CAN'T YOU JUST CALL ME?

16:23.753 --> 16:27.417
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT
YOU WANNA HEAR ON THE PHONE.

16:27.417 --> 16:30.360
(Victor)
...AND NOT FOLLOW THIS TREND.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.662
(whispers indistinctly)
 AND WE WILL PUT EDUCATION
WHERE IT BELONGS--

16:32.662 --> 16:35.665
AT THE TOP OF THE LIST.
 EW! HOW DID YOU GET THOSE?

16:35.665 --> 16:39.469
HOW DO YOU THINK? EDIE.

16:39.469 --> 16:42.072
YOU ARE STILL
SLEEPING WITH EDIE?

16:42.072 --> 16:44.574
WELL, YOU'RE STILL SLEEPING
WITH VICTOR, AREN'T YOU?

16:44.574 --> 16:47.577
YEAH, IF I DIDN'T, HE WOULD
THINK SOMETHING IS GOING ON.

16:47.577 --> 16:49.579
WHAT IS YOUR EXCUSE
FOR DOING IT WITH EDIE?

16:49.579 --> 16:51.581
SHE WANTS TO,
AND I'M A GUY.

16:51.581 --> 16:53.243
OW!
 THIS IS SERIOUS, OKAY?

16:53.243 --> 16:56.186
IF VICTOR WAKES UP
WITH A ZOO IN HIS PANTS,

16:56.186 --> 16:58.188
THERE'S GONNA BE HELL TO PAY.

16:58.188 --> 17:01.321
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
IF HE FINDS OUT ABOUT US,

17:01.321 --> 17:04.324
I'M THE ONE THAT'S GONNA
WIND UP IN A LANDFILL.
 OKAY, JUST DON'T PANIC, OKAY?

17:04.324 --> 17:06.326
WE'RE GONNA GET THE SALVE
OR THE OINTMENT

17:06.326 --> 17:09.329
OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU PUT DOWN
THERE, AND WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.701
(applause)

17:17.036 --> 17:19.169
WE'RE SCREWED.
 YEAH.

17:26.346 --> 17:29.349
(Lynette)
TOM? THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.351
ARE YOU COMING TO BED
ANYTIME SOON?

17:31.351 --> 17:34.053
YEAH, I JUST GOTTA PICK
A NEW RUNNING BACK

17:34.053 --> 17:36.356
FOR MY FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.761
THAT'S TOO BAD.

17:41.761 --> 17:46.065
I HAD A LITTLE FANTASY THING
PLANNED OF MY OWN.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.538
WHOA. LYNETTE...

17:48.538 --> 17:50.540
LYNETTE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.343
I'M BRANDY,
THE SLUTTY CHEERLEADER.

17:53.343 --> 17:54.844
(giggles)

17:54.844 --> 17:55.845
(grunts)

17:55.845 --> 17:58.608
(laughing)

18:05.855 --> 18:07.857
THIS IS ALL VERY ROMANTIC,
GABY,

18:07.857 --> 18:10.520
BUT I STILL HAVE
FOUR BUILDING PROPOSALS TO READ

18:10.520 --> 18:11.861
BEFORE TOMORROW.

18:11.861 --> 18:15.325
THAT'SNURSEGABY TO YOU.

18:17.367 --> 18:18.768
NURSE GABY?

18:18.768 --> 18:21.371
(chuckles)

18:21.371 --> 18:22.872
AM I SICK?

18:22.872 --> 18:26.136
WELL, THE DOCTOR SAYS
YOU NEED TO RELAX,

18:26.136 --> 18:29.839
ANDIKNOW
JUST HOW TO RELAX YOU.

18:29.839 --> 18:31.881
WOW.

18:39.149 --> 18:41.651
IT SMELLS LIKE LICORICE.

18:41.651 --> 18:44.154
IT'S A BLEND
OF 36 ESSENTIAL OILS,

18:44.154 --> 18:46.226
ANISE ROOT AND FENNEL.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.228
DO YOU LIKE IT?

18:48.228 --> 18:50.560
IT SMELLS
A LITTLE MEDICINE-Y.

18:50.560 --> 18:53.403
THAT'S THE FENNEL.
(chuckles)

19:03.713 --> 19:06.746
IT'S STINGING A LITTLE.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.248
THAT'S THE TENSION...

19:08.248 --> 19:11.251
(whispers)
LEAVING YOUR BODY.

19:11.251 --> 19:14.184
IT'SREALLYSTINGING.

19:14.184 --> 19:16.186
AND WE CAN RINSE IT OFF...

19:16.186 --> 19:17.827
IN THREE TO FIVE MINUTES.

19:17.827 --> 19:22.192
BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT...

19:22.192 --> 19:23.933
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

19:23.933 --> 19:26.936
YOU KNOW, FOR A GUY GETTING
RUBBED DOWN BY A HOT NURSE,

19:26.936 --> 19:29.799
YOU ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
 SORRY.

19:36.846 --> 19:38.508
OH, COME ON, UNCLE FRANK.

19:38.508 --> 19:40.510
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF HAVING A GAY UNCLE

19:40.510 --> 19:43.513
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP ME
MAKE FRIENDS WITH THESE GUYS?

19:43.513 --> 19:45.215
OH.

19:45.215 --> 19:47.717
UH, MOM SAID
THAT THE WHOLE FAMILY KNEW.

19:49.859 --> 19:52.562
UM, OKAY. GOTTA GO. LOVE YOU.
 (beep)

19:52.562 --> 19:55.695
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 OH, I FOUND RAPHAEL
WANDERING IN THE STREET.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.568
I WENT TO TAKE HIM BACK,
BUT BOB AND LEE AREN'T HOME,

19:58.568 --> 20:00.570
SO I'M JUST GONNA
GIVE HIM A LITTLE TREAT

20:00.570 --> 20:02.732
AND PUT HIM BACK
IN THEIR YARD.
 BUP, BUP, BUP! WAIT A SECOND.

20:02.732 --> 20:04.934
WHAT?
 LEAVE HIM WITH ME.

20:04.934 --> 20:06.876
I NEED TO SCORE SOME POINTS
WITH THOSE GUYS,

20:06.876 --> 20:09.609
AND BEING A DOG-RESCUING HERO
COULD BE JUST THE TICKET.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.612
SO WHAT, YOU'RE JUST GONNA KEEP
HIM HERE UNTIL THEY COME BACK?

20:12.612 --> 20:14.884
UH-HUH. MAYBE A LITTLE LONGER.
 HOW LONG?

20:14.884 --> 20:16.886
WELL, LONG ENOUGH
FOR THEM TO WORRY.

20:16.886 --> 20:19.889
YOU KNOW, THE MORE THEY WORRY,
THE MORE I'M A HERO. GET IT?

20:19.889 --> 20:22.552
I GET THAT YOU'RE INSANE.

20:22.552 --> 20:24.754
I'M NOT, I'M NOT.
NOW GET SOME MUD.

20:24.754 --> 20:27.627
I WANNA DIRTY HIM UP SO HE LOOKS
LIKE HE'S BEEN THROUGH HELL.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.559
OKAY, IN YOU GO.

20:32.962 --> 20:35.465
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THOSE.

20:35.465 --> 20:38.308
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'VE GOT THEM, MR. KNIEVEL.

20:38.308 --> 20:42.342
OH, BOY. YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
LET ME LIVE THIS DOWN, ARE YOU?
 NOPE.

20:42.342 --> 20:46.776
I THOUGHT THE SAME THING.
 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU
SHOULD GO TO THE DOCTOR AGAIN.

20:46.776 --> 20:48.278
(all) SURPRISE!

20:48.278 --> 20:50.880
(cheering)

20:50.880 --> 20:53.923
UH, GUYS...
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

20:53.923 --> 20:56.426
YOU SAID "NO SHOWER."
BUT LOOK AROUND--MEN.

20:56.426 --> 20:59.589
SO TECHNICALLY, IT'S A PARTY,
NOT A SHOWER. MWAH.

20:59.589 --> 21:01.961
ANDREW TOLD US
THAT YOU ONLY SAID NO...
 (kisses)

21:01.961 --> 21:04.564
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO IMPOSE.

21:04.564 --> 21:07.297
OH! (laughs)
SO YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE?

21:07.297 --> 21:10.300
YEAH, WELL, I-I KNOW YOU SAID
NOT TO MAKE A BIG FUSS,

21:10.300 --> 21:13.303
BUT, HEY, YOU EARNED IT.

21:13.303 --> 21:15.605
(Gabrielle) WELL, DON'T JUST
STAND THERE. COME IN.

21:15.605 --> 21:19.309
WE HAVE LOTS OF FOOD
AND FUN AND SURPRISES.

21:19.309 --> 21:23.313
(under breath)
YEAH,ALL KINDSOF SURPRISES.

21:23.313 --> 21:25.014
(woman, singsong voice)
WHERE IS SHE?

21:25.014 --> 21:27.987
BREE!

21:27.987 --> 21:29.519
PHYLLIS!

21:29.519 --> 21:32.291
I, UH, HELPED
WITH THE INVITATIONS, TOO.

21:32.291 --> 21:36.065
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW TOUCHED
I WAS TO BE INCLUDED,

21:36.065 --> 21:39.799
ESPECIALLY AFTER
MY MANY CONCILIATORY GESTURES

21:39.799 --> 21:42.372
WERE SO COLDLY REBUFFED.

21:42.372 --> 21:44.033
I HAVE BEEN AWFUL.

21:44.033 --> 21:47.076
I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU
IF YOU STORMED OUT RIGHT NOW.

21:47.076 --> 21:48.578
NONSENSE.

21:48.578 --> 21:52.081
I'M HERE TO CELEBRATE
OUR RENEWED FRIENDSHIP...

21:52.081 --> 21:54.043
AND YOUR BABY.

21:54.043 --> 21:56.686
OR SHOULD I SAYBABIES?

21:56.686 --> 21:58.988
YOU KNOW,
IT'S OFTEN A SIGN OF TWINS

21:58.988 --> 22:02.051
WHEN A MOTHER'S FACE
GETS ALL PLUMP LIKE YOURS.

22:03.493 --> 22:05.054
OH, UM...

22:05.054 --> 22:07.056
I, UH,
BET YOU WOULDN'T MIND

22:07.056 --> 22:09.559
IF I BROKE MY NECK
ON THAT SCOOTER NOW.

22:15.965 --> 22:17.967
I'M OFF TO THE BANK.

22:17.967 --> 22:20.970
AUNT LILY JUST TOOK A PILL,
SO SHE'S DOWN FOR THE AFTERNOON.

22:20.970 --> 22:22.642
OKAY. HAVE FUN.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.350
(bell tinkles)

22:32.722 --> 22:35.685
(tinkling)

22:35.685 --> 22:38.127
IS YOUR MOTHER GONE?

22:38.127 --> 22:40.089
YEAH. DO YOU NEED HER?

22:40.089 --> 22:43.032
NO, NO.
 (sets down bell)

22:43.032 --> 22:45.395
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED.

22:45.395 --> 22:47.667
I THOUGHT
YOU TOOK A SLEEPING PILL.

22:47.667 --> 22:51.441
I PRETENDED TO
SO SHE'D LEAVE US ALONE.

22:51.441 --> 22:54.774
AUNT LILY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:54.774 --> 22:57.046
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

22:57.046 --> 23:03.382
FIRST, YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT WHAT HAPPENED...

23:03.382 --> 23:06.456
(gulps)
IT WAS NOBODY'S FAULT.

23:06.456 --> 23:08.988
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"WHAT HAPPENED"?

23:08.988 --> 23:12.762
YOU DON'T REMEMBER LIVING
ON THIS STREET BEFORE, DO YOU?

23:12.762 --> 23:14.163
NO.
 (panting)

23:14.163 --> 23:18.468
WELL...
THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT.

23:18.468 --> 23:20.099
(Katherine) DYLAN?

23:25.004 --> 23:27.737
MOM, I THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

23:27.737 --> 23:29.138
I FORGOT MY CHECKBOOK.

23:29.138 --> 23:32.942
COULD YOU GO DOWN
AND FIND IT FOR ME?
 SURE.

23:46.195 --> 23:49.198
YOU REALLY
SHOULD GET YOUR REST.

23:58.508 --> 24:02.141
(indistinct conversations)

24:02.141 --> 24:04.043
HEY.
 HI.

24:04.043 --> 24:07.046
HI. GOT YOUR WIG BACK, HUH?
 YEAH. MM-HMM. GOOD AS NEW.

24:07.046 --> 24:10.049
LISTEN, I THOUGHT WE COULD PUT
THE KIDS TO BED EARLY TONIGHT,

24:10.049 --> 24:12.451
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.954
I DO, AND I'M UP FOR THAT.

24:14.954 --> 24:17.787
FANTASTIC.

24:17.787 --> 24:20.490
I HOPE BRANDY
WON'T GET STUCK LATE

24:20.490 --> 24:21.961
AT CHEERLEADING PRACTICE.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.463
OH, ABOUT BRANDY...

24:24.463 --> 24:25.595
BAD NEWS.

24:25.595 --> 24:27.166
WHAT? WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?

24:27.166 --> 24:30.169
WELL, PENNY WANTED TO PLAY
BEAUTY SCHOOL WITH THE WIG,

24:30.169 --> 24:33.202
AND, WELL, LET'S JUST SAY SHE'S
GOT NO FUTURE AS A STYLIST.

24:33.202 --> 24:35.204
(chuckles) BAD HAIRCUT, HUH?

24:35.204 --> 24:36.576
OH.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.909
SOUNDS LIKE BRANDY MIGHT GET
AWFUL MAD ABOUT THAT.

24:39.909 --> 24:43.212
BRANDY'S HISTORY, TOM.
LET HER GO.

24:47.957 --> 24:49.919
(Lee in distance) RAPHAEL!

24:49.919 --> 24:52.121
COME HERE! RAPHAEL!

24:52.121 --> 24:54.794
COME HOME, BOY!
 (clapping hands)

24:54.794 --> 24:56.265
RAPHAEL?!

24:57.967 --> 25:00.600
LEE? IS SOMETHING WRONG?
 RAPHAEL GOT OUT.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.603
I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
I THINK HE JUMPED THE FENCE.

25:03.603 --> 25:07.206
OH. WELL, WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO HELP YOU LOOK FOR HIM?

25:07.206 --> 25:10.009
SERIOUSLY?
WHAT A--WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARTY?

25:10.009 --> 25:12.511
OH. (chuckles)
IT'S JUST A BABY SHOWER...

25:12.511 --> 25:15.184
THAT I'M THROWING...
FOR MY BEST FRIEND.

25:15.184 --> 25:17.917
I CAN'T--I CAN'T ASK YOU
TO LEAVE THAT. THAT'S--

25:17.917 --> 25:20.289
OH, PLEASE.
WHAT ARE NEIGHBORS FOR?

25:20.289 --> 25:21.991
RAPHAEL?!

25:21.991 --> 25:23.723
HERE, PUPPY!

25:26.525 --> 25:30.730
I SEE YOU'VE TAKEN DOWN
ALL THE PICTURES OF REX.

25:30.730 --> 25:33.102
WELL, I'M, UH, SORRY
IF THAT OFFENDS YOU, PHYLLIS,

25:33.102 --> 25:36.105
BUT I DIDN'T WANT ORSON TO FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE IN HIS NEW HOME.

25:36.105 --> 25:37.907
I SEE.

25:37.907 --> 25:41.070
YOU'RE TRYING TO BE CONSIDERATE
OF YOUR HUSBAND'S FEELINGS.

25:41.070 --> 25:45.114
WELL, I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE
AT LEASTTRYINGTO GET IT RIGHT

25:45.114 --> 25:47.546
THE SECOND TIME AROUND.

25:47.546 --> 25:51.550
STILL, IT MUST BE AWFULLY HARD
ON DANIELLE AND ANDREW

25:51.550 --> 25:55.585
TO HAVE THEIR FATHER'S FACE
BANISHED FROM THEIR OWN HOME.

25:55.585 --> 25:58.588
HE WASN'T BANISHED.

25:58.588 --> 26:00.860
BY THE WAY...

26:00.860 --> 26:02.992
WHERE--WHERE'S DANIELLE?

26:04.834 --> 26:07.867
SHE'S, UH,
AT BOARDING SCHOOL...

26:07.867 --> 26:09.338
IN SWITZERLAND.

26:09.338 --> 26:12.071
SWITZERLAND?!
IS IT ASKING TOO MUCH

26:12.071 --> 26:14.173
TO BE TOLD WHAT CONTINENT
MY GRANDDAUGHTER IS ON?!

26:14.173 --> 26:16.706
YOU ARE KEEPING
MY GRANDCHILDREN FROM ME,

26:16.706 --> 26:18.577
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.979
I'M GOING TO MINGLE.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.281
EVERY TIME I START A CHAT,
YOU WALK AWAY.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.954
I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO ME,

26:24.954 --> 26:26.886
WHY DID YOU INVITE ME?

26:26.886 --> 26:29.819
IT'S A SURPRISE PARTY,
YOU DAFT WOMAN!

26:29.819 --> 26:32.822
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I HAD A HAND IN THE GUEST LIST?

26:32.822 --> 26:34.824
SO...
YOU DON'T WANT ME HERE?

26:34.824 --> 26:36.626
OH, FOR GOD SAKES, PHYLLIS,

26:36.626 --> 26:40.099
IT'S NOT AS IF WE GOT ALONG
WHEN REX WAS ALIVE.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.601
WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU

26:42.601 --> 26:45.104
BUT TRY TO TREAT YOU
LIKE A DAUGHTER?

26:45.104 --> 26:48.337
I EVEN GAVE YOU
MY MOTHER'S SABLE COAT.

26:48.337 --> 26:51.040
YOU HATED YOUR MOTHER.
 BUT I LOVED THAT COAT.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.042
THEN I'LL
GIVE IT BACK TO YOU.

26:53.042 --> 26:54.714
NO, YOU KEEP IT

26:54.714 --> 26:57.216
AS A REMINDER
OF HOW HARD I TRIED

26:57.216 --> 26:59.248
TO MAKE YOU LIKE ME.

26:59.248 --> 27:01.791
(sighs deeply)

27:01.791 --> 27:04.994
GRANDMA,
ARE YOU LEAVING ALREADY?

27:04.994 --> 27:06.656
I'M SORRY, DEAR,

27:06.656 --> 27:10.329
BUT YOUR MOTHER HAS MADE IT
 IMPOSSIBLEFOR ME TO STAY.

27:14.704 --> 27:17.636
WHERE DOES SHE KEEP
MY SABLE COAT?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.939
PROBABLY
IN HER BEDROOM CLOSET.

27:27.316 --> 27:28.978
WHERE IS SHE GOING?

27:28.978 --> 27:32.181
SHE ASKED ME
WHERE YOUR FUR COAT WAS.

27:32.181 --> 27:34.183
AND--AND YOU TOLD HER?!

27:36.355 --> 27:38.988
OH, CRAP.

27:48.337 --> 27:53.342
I GUESS YOU WON'T BE NEEDING
THE BREAST PUMP I BOUGHT YOU.

28:05.384 --> 28:08.888
(chuckles) SO...
 DANIELLEIS HAVING A BABY.

28:08.888 --> 28:11.390
YES, AND FOR THE SAKE
OF HER REPUTATION,

28:11.390 --> 28:14.223
WE'VE AGREED
TO PRETEND THAT IT'S MINE.

28:14.223 --> 28:15.725
I JUST HOPE THAT

28:15.725 --> 28:17.997
THOSE SWISS DOCTORS
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

28:17.997 --> 28:20.129
SHE'S NOT IN SWITZERLAND.

28:20.129 --> 28:22.431
SHE'S AT
THE SISTERS OF HOPE CONVENT.

28:22.431 --> 28:26.005
LOOK, PHYLLIS, I'M SORRY.
I KNOW THIS IS UPSETTING.

28:26.005 --> 28:29.438
ACTUALLY, I'M THRILLED.

28:29.438 --> 28:31.410
I'M GOING TO BE
A GREAT-GRANDMA.

28:33.442 --> 28:35.344
WELL, UM... (chuckles)

28:35.344 --> 28:38.818
TECHNICALLY, YES.

28:38.818 --> 28:42.451
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"TECHNICALLY"?

28:42.451 --> 28:45.724
WE'RE SAYING THAT THE BABY
IS MINE AND ORSON'S,

28:45.724 --> 28:48.357
AND IF YOU HOVER AROUND
LIKE A GRANDMOTHER,

28:48.357 --> 28:50.429
PEOPLE WILL BE SUSPICIOUS.

28:50.429 --> 28:53.302
YOU'RENOT
 KEEPING THIS BABY FROM ME,

28:53.302 --> 28:56.435
NOT IF YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO TELL THOSE PEOPLE DOWNSTAIRS

28:56.435 --> 28:59.208
WHOSE CHILD IT REALLY IS.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.871
YOUWOULDN'T.
 THINK OF DANIELLE!

29:01.871 --> 29:03.913
I WISH YOU HAD.

29:03.913 --> 29:05.915
IF YOU'D RAISED HER
PROPERLY,

29:05.915 --> 29:09.018
SHE WOULDN'T BEPREGNANT
 WITHOUT AHUSBAND.

29:09.018 --> 29:12.021
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
I'M A FAILURE AS A PARENT?

29:12.021 --> 29:14.253
THAT'S WHY THIS CHILD
MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.255
IT'S MY SECOND CHANCE.

29:16.255 --> 29:19.428
WELL, I HOPE THE SECOND TIME
AROUND THAT YOU TAKE MY ADVICE.

29:19.428 --> 29:24.263
I ALWAYS SAID THAT YOU WERE
TOO STRICT WITH THOSE KIDS.

29:24.263 --> 29:28.437
PARENTING TIPS FROM YOU?
THAT'S RICH.

29:28.437 --> 29:31.801
I WAS A WONDERFUL MOTHER
TO REX.
 THEN WHY DID HE
ALWAYS AVOID YOU?

29:31.801 --> 29:34.103
WHY WERE YOU BARELY
EVER HERE?

29:34.103 --> 29:38.377
BECAUSE OF YOU!
HE KNEW YOU HATED ME.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.880
OH, HE WAS HAPPY
TO LET YOU THINK THAT,

29:40.880 --> 29:43.552
BUT HE WAS THE ONE
WHO DREADED YOUR VISITS.

29:43.552 --> 29:46.785
(whispers) OH.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.518
OH. (gasps) PHYLLIS, WAIT!

29:51.320 --> 29:55.264
EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE,
BUT I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.429
WHAT--WHAT IS IT, GRANDMA?

30:00.429 --> 30:02.571
I...

30:14.844 --> 30:16.585
I HAVE TO GO,

30:16.585 --> 30:20.819
AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY
HOW NICE IT WAS

30:20.819 --> 30:24.493
TO SEE YOU ALL AGAIN
AFTER SO MUCH TIME.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.297
GOOD-BYE.

30:35.965 --> 30:39.108
(lowered voice)
THANK YOU FOR THE GIFT.

30:39.108 --> 30:41.340
YOU KNOW, BREE,

30:41.340 --> 30:44.874
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO WOULD LIKE A SECOND CHANCE.

30:51.520 --> 30:54.123
NOTHING, HUH?
 NO. NO, HE'S LOST.

30:54.123 --> 30:56.125
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

30:56.125 --> 30:58.127
THERE'S NO WAY
HE'S GONNA FIND HIS WAY HOME.

30:58.127 --> 31:00.629
OH, HE WILL. COME ON.
YOU GOTTA KEEP BELIEVING.

31:00.629 --> 31:04.263
OH, CRAP! BOB'S HOME. (scoffs)
WHAT AM I GONNA TELL HIM?

31:04.263 --> 31:05.935
DON'T.
WE'LL JUST KEEP LOOKING.

31:05.935 --> 31:08.938
I HAVE A FEELING WE'RE GONNA
FIND THAT CUTE LITTLE GUY.

31:08.938 --> 31:10.940
YOU--YOU ARE SO NICE
TO DO THIS,

31:10.940 --> 31:13.943
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY AFTER
THE WAY I ACTED WHEN WE FIRST--

31:13.943 --> 31:15.945
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

31:15.945 --> 31:17.947
I'M GONNA GO INSIDE
AND GET US SOME WATER,

31:17.947 --> 31:20.449
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
JUST KEEP LOOKING.
 OKAY.

31:26.055 --> 31:28.887
(door closes)

31:28.887 --> 31:32.291
LEE! I CAN'T FIND RAPHAEL.
YOU SEEN HIM ANYWHERE?

31:32.291 --> 31:35.094
OH, BOB, PROM--PROMISE
YOU WON'T HATE ME.

31:35.094 --> 31:37.096
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT HAPPENED?
 RAPHAEL GOT OUT.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.998
HE GOT OUT?
 YEAH.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.931
HE DOESN'T KNOW
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
 I KNOW HE DOESN'T KNOW
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

31:41.931 --> 31:43.933
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 I KNOW--I DON'T--

31:43.933 --> 31:46.505
(Bob and Lee
arguing indistinctly)

31:46.505 --> 31:49.678
HOW ARE YOU LOOKING FOR HIM?
 WELL, SUSAN, SHE--
SHE'S GETTING WATER.

31:49.678 --> 31:52.911
(barking)

31:52.911 --> 31:56.115
OH, WAIT,
HE'S RIGHT THERE.

31:56.115 --> 31:59.088
HEY, HEY. OH! HEY! HEY!

31:59.088 --> 32:02.151
OH! OH, MY GOD!

32:11.930 --> 32:14.603
WHAT WAS OUR DOG DOING
IN YOUR GARAGE?

32:14.603 --> 32:16.365
I HAVE NO IDEA.

32:23.342 --> 32:26.115
WHAT?

32:26.115 --> 32:29.448
(indistinct conversations)

32:29.448 --> 32:30.949
(man) HERE WE GO.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.354
(lowered voice)
DID YOU GET A CHANCE

32:35.354 --> 32:37.356
TO, UH,
NAPALM THE JUNGLE YET?

32:37.356 --> 32:39.288
YEP.
 AND?

32:39.288 --> 32:41.330
ALL QUIET
ON THE SOUTHERN FRONT.

32:43.662 --> 32:46.495
GABY, WE HAVE GOT TO BE
MORE CAREFUL.

32:46.495 --> 32:48.697
ABSOLUTELY.

32:48.697 --> 32:51.340
IT'S KIND OF EXCITING,
THOUGH.

32:51.340 --> 32:53.342
WHAT IS?
 PLAYING WITH FIRE,

32:53.342 --> 32:55.474
ALMOST GETTING BURNED
BUT NOT QUITE.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.476
DON'T BE THINKING LIKE THAT.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.978
IF VICTOR CATCHES US,
HE'LL KILL US BOTH.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.981
(whispers)
THAT'S WHAT'S SO EXCITING.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.584
HI.

33:05.584 --> 33:06.715
HI.

33:06.715 --> 33:08.987
OH, MY--EXCUSE ME.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.519
(sniffs)

33:10.519 --> 33:13.162
MMM, THAT'S, UM...

33:13.162 --> 33:15.694
AN INTERESTING COLOGNE
YOU'RE WEARING.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.696
MY WIFE GAVE IT TO ME.

33:17.696 --> 33:21.730
IT'S GOT, UH,
ANISE ROOT, FENNEL.

33:21.730 --> 33:24.373
WHAT, YOU LIKE IT?

33:24.373 --> 33:26.675
YEAH, IT'S JUST, UM...

33:26.675 --> 33:30.539
I DON'T KNOW...
WEIRDLY FAMILIAR.

33:40.149 --> 33:42.051
CRAB CAKE?

33:42.051 --> 33:45.054
UH, YEAH. THANKS.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.159
CRAB CAKE?

33:56.335 --> 33:58.437
CRAB CAKE?
 OH, THANK YOU.

34:03.612 --> 34:04.673
CRAB CAKE?

34:04.673 --> 34:05.744
THANK YOU.

34:34.143 --> 34:36.475
KIDS ARE ASLEEP.

34:37.846 --> 34:40.509
I'MNOT.

34:40.509 --> 34:42.380
(chuckles)

34:42.380 --> 34:45.784
WHATCHA GOT BACK THERE?
 JUST A LITTLE PRESENT.

34:45.784 --> 34:46.815
(grunts)

34:46.815 --> 34:50.458
SAY HELLO TO BRANDY'S
EVEN SLUTTIER SISTER...

34:50.458 --> 34:52.190
CANDY.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.862
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:54.862 --> 34:56.864
WELL,
I JUST--I JUST THOUGHT

34:56.864 --> 34:58.867
SINCE WE HAD SO MUCH FUN
LAST NIGHT,

34:58.867 --> 35:01.200
MAYBE WE CAN HAVE
A LITTLEMOREFUN.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.701
AND THAT'S ONLY POSSIBLE

35:02.701 --> 35:04.873
WHEN YOU'RE PRETENDING
I'M SOMEONE ELSE?

35:06.575 --> 35:08.777
WELL,
YOU HAVE TO PRETEND, TOO.

35:10.539 --> 35:12.141
WHAT?

35:12.141 --> 35:14.183
THIS... (scoffs)

35:14.183 --> 35:18.787
ISME,TOM,
NOT BRANDY OR CANDY.

35:18.787 --> 35:22.651
IT'S JUST YOUR WIFE, LYNETTE.
AM I NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

35:22.651 --> 35:24.653
WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING SO MAD FOR?

35:24.653 --> 35:26.455
THE FIRST WIG WAS YOUR IDEA.

35:26.455 --> 35:28.897
YEAH, BECAUSE I'M BALD.

35:28.897 --> 35:31.200
AND I KNOW THAT
THAT'S A BIG OLD TURNOFF,

35:31.200 --> 35:33.262
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T HELP IT.

35:33.262 --> 35:35.133
I HAVE CANCER.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.136
YES, I KNOW.
I HEAR ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.440
CAN YOU BLAME ME FOR WANTING
TO ESCAPE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE?

35:41.440 --> 35:44.343
ESCAPE FROMME,YOU MEAN?
 YES!

35:44.343 --> 35:46.775
YOU KNOW WHY LAST NIGHT
WAS SO MUCH FUN?

35:46.775 --> 35:49.778
BECAUSE I GOT TO MAKE LOVE
TO SOMEONE WHO WASN'T SICK.

35:49.778 --> 35:52.781
LOOK, I KNOW, I KNOW, I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO SAY THIS STUFF.

35:52.781 --> 35:54.783
I HAVE TO BE
THE HEROIC HUSBAND WHO LISTENS

35:54.783 --> 35:57.786
AND HOLDS YOU WHEN YOU CRY
AND NEVER CRIES HIMSELF.

35:57.786 --> 36:00.329
BUT THIS AFFECTS ME, TOO.

36:00.329 --> 36:03.732
WELL... I KNOW THAT.

36:03.732 --> 36:05.234
YOU DO?
 YEAH.

36:05.234 --> 36:06.535
HOW?

36:06.535 --> 36:08.537
SINCE THIS WHOLE THING BEGAN,

36:08.537 --> 36:11.169
HAVE YOU EVER ONCE
ASKED ME HOWI'MDOING?

36:19.708 --> 36:22.251
OH... MY GOD.

36:22.251 --> 36:24.813
I HAVEN'T, HAVE I?

36:27.386 --> 36:29.218
(sighs)

36:30.719 --> 36:33.422
I AM ONE OF THOSE...

36:33.422 --> 36:38.497
WHINY, SELF-INVOLVED
SICK PEOPLE.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.401
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

36:42.401 --> 36:44.403
NO, I AM. IT'S BEEN MONTHS,

36:44.403 --> 36:47.406
AND I HAVE BARELY THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.408
IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH SOMETHING--

36:49.408 --> 36:51.410
WILL YOU STOP
BEING SO HEROIC?!

36:51.410 --> 36:52.911
I'M A CANCER BITCH!

36:59.988 --> 37:01.820
WHAT?

37:01.820 --> 37:05.223
I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE
WITH YOU.

37:05.223 --> 37:08.427
(laughing) YOU SUCK.

37:14.463 --> 37:17.005
WELL...

37:17.005 --> 37:20.439
I GUESS I COULD
GIVE CANDY A WHIRL.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.911
ARE THE KIDS REALLY ASLEEP?

37:22.911 --> 37:25.414
'CAUSE I THINK
SHE MIGHT BE A SCREAMER.

37:29.948 --> 37:33.522
ACTUALLY,
IF WE'RE GONNA PRETEND...

37:33.522 --> 37:35.954
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT

37:35.954 --> 37:39.257
I'MNOTA HERO

37:39.257 --> 37:41.760
AND YOU ARE NOT
A CANCER PATIENT?

37:41.760 --> 37:46.865
WE'LL JUST BE
TOM AND LYNETTE,

37:46.865 --> 37:48.537
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

37:50.299 --> 37:52.301
OH, I'D LIKE THAT.

37:59.348 --> 38:01.780
(door opens)

38:01.780 --> 38:04.513
HOW'S BOB'S SUIT?

38:04.513 --> 38:07.516
RUINED.
 OH. WHAT IF WE TAKE IT
TO MY CLEANERS?

38:07.516 --> 38:09.518
SUSAN, THAT PAINT'S
NOT COMING OUT...
 (whimpers)

38:09.518 --> 38:12.020
SO WE'RE BUYING HIM
A NEW SUIT...

38:12.020 --> 38:13.822
FOR 2,000 BUCKS.

38:13.822 --> 38:15.324
(gasps) $2,000?

38:15.324 --> 38:17.826
WELL, ACCORDING TO LEE,
IT'S A DOLCE.

38:17.826 --> 38:20.969
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
BUT HE SAID IT SIX TIMES.
 THAT'S CRAZY.

38:20.969 --> 38:22.971
NO, WHAT'S CRAZY IS
I'M ABOUT TO BUY

38:22.971 --> 38:24.973
THE MOST EXPENSIVE SUIT
OF MY LIFE,

38:24.973 --> 38:26.535
AND I'LL NEVER WEAR IT.

38:26.535 --> 38:29.508
OH. I JUST WANTED THEM
TO LIKE ME.

38:29.508 --> 38:30.979
WELL, THEY DON'T.

38:30.979 --> 38:33.382
LEE SAID THAT SIX TIMES, TOO.

38:33.382 --> 38:36.385
THERE MUST BE SOME WAY
I CAN APOLOGIZE TO THEM.

38:36.385 --> 38:38.387
WE CAN'T AFFORD
ANY MORE OF YOUR APOLOGIES.

38:38.387 --> 38:41.820
I KNOW. UH, MAYBE IF I--
 DAMN IT, SUSAN,
LET IT GO, OKAY?

38:41.820 --> 38:45.454
I ASKED YOU TO BEFORE, AND YOU
DIDN'T, AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.

38:45.454 --> 38:47.956
SO I'LL ASK YOU AGAIN.
JUST LET IT GO.

38:47.956 --> 38:50.459
MIKE, WAIT.
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS.

38:50.459 --> 38:51.960
I'M GOING TO BED.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.933
I'VE GOTTA WORK TOMORROW.
I'M BUYING A SUIT.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.845
(knock on door)

39:09.117 --> 39:11.349
GRANDMA!

39:12.881 --> 39:17.055
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
 YOU NEEDN'T BE EMBARRASSED,
DEAR.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.057
YOUR MOTHER'S TOLD ME
EVERYTHING.

39:19.057 --> 39:22.591
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.
 (chuckles)

39:22.591 --> 39:25.594
I HATE THIS PLACE.
IT'S LIKE BABY JAIL.

39:25.594 --> 39:29.037
OH. WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'VE COME TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

39:29.037 --> 39:31.870
PERHAPS IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO LEAVE.

39:36.074 --> 39:39.147
(Lily, raspy voice)
DYLAN?

39:39.147 --> 39:41.009
IS THAT YOU?

39:41.009 --> 39:43.412
WE HAVE--HAVE TO TALK.

39:43.412 --> 39:46.415
(panting)

39:54.022 --> 39:56.394
HEY.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.066
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

39:58.066 --> 40:00.769
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT AUNT LILY.

40:00.769 --> 40:02.801
WHAT ABOUT HER?

40:04.803 --> 40:08.537
IT WAS SO WEIRD. SHE CALLED ME
INTO HER ROOM THIS AFTERNOON.

40:08.537 --> 40:10.539
SHE STARTED SAYING
SHE KNEW WHY

40:10.539 --> 40:13.411
I DIDN'T REMEMBER LIVING
ON THIS STREET BEFORE.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.614
OH, SWEETIE.

40:15.614 --> 40:18.146
YOUR AUNT LILY
IS FADING FAST.

40:18.146 --> 40:20.849
HALF THE TIME, SHE DOESN'T
KNOW WHAT SHE'S SAYING.

40:20.849 --> 40:24.192
(rattling)

40:24.192 --> 40:26.024
WAS THAT HER?

40:26.024 --> 40:28.857
NO, I JUST CHECKED ON HER.
SHE'S SLEEPING.

40:28.857 --> 40:32.130
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
THAT RECITAL IN TWO WEEKS.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.962
SHOULDN'T YOU BE PRACTICING?

40:39.207 --> 40:42.711
(panting) DYLAN.

40:45.644 --> 40:48.977
PLEASE!

40:48.977 --> 40:52.581
(playing Bach's
"Cello Suite No. 1 in G Major")

40:52.581 --> 40:56.725
(continues panting)

40:56.725 --> 40:59.728
♪♪♪

41:46.104 --> 41:48.106
(music concludes)

41:48.106 --> 41:50.108
(paper hits floor)

41:55.283 --> 41:57.986
PESTS--

41:57.986 --> 42:01.690
THEY COME
IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES

42:01.690 --> 42:06.194
AND DISRUPT OUR LIVES
IN A VARIETY OF WAYS.

42:06.194 --> 42:11.630
AT FIRST,
THEY'RE MERELY ANNOYING,

42:11.630 --> 42:15.934
AND WE DO OUR BEST
TO IGNORE THEM.

42:15.934 --> 42:17.936
HOME IN MY OWN BED....

42:17.936 --> 42:20.238
BUT IF WE DON'T
TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY,

42:20.238 --> 42:24.973
THEY CAN
BECOME QUITE DANGEROUS.

42:24.973 --> 42:26.975
FOR SOME,

42:26.975 --> 42:31.219
DEATH SEEMS TO BE
THE EASIEST SOLUTION.

42:37.786 --> 42:40.859
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH PESTS

42:40.859 --> 42:43.862
IS THAT
WHAT THEY LEAVE BEHIND...

42:43.862 --> 42:45.864
IS JUST AS DANGEROUS.
