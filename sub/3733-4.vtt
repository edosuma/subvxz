00:01.091 --> 00:03.049
<i>Previously, on Hannibal...</i>

00:03.050 --> 00:05.427
Dr. Hannibal Lecter requests
my company for dinner.

00:05.428 --> 00:06.825
This will be our last supper.

00:06.826 --> 00:10.311
Hannibal thinks you are his man
in the room. I think you're mine.

00:10.312 --> 00:12.508
They've issued a warrant
for your arrest, Will.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.453
- Hello?
- They know.

00:14.454 --> 00:16.766
Hello, Jack. You're early.

00:39.907 --> 00:41.326
Each of us

00:42.375 --> 00:46.295
whose life intersected
Hannibal Lecter lost something.

00:46.845 --> 00:50.114
A limb here, a lung there.

00:50.472 --> 00:52.352
A few feet of intestines.

00:55.392 --> 00:56.995
The dead...

00:59.957 --> 01:04.010
The dead at least have the luxury

01:04.010 --> 01:07.415
of being done with what they lost.

01:09.971 --> 01:13.076
But you and I, we still itch.

01:14.351 --> 01:17.308
That little itch
must be telling you something.

01:20.348 --> 01:23.762
Would you like to discuss what
that little itch is telling you?

01:24.558 --> 01:26.611
Are you wearing makeup?

01:28.141 --> 01:31.349
How long does it take you to
put your face on in the morning?

01:31.693 --> 01:34.362
Now that I've got the
routine down, no time at all.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.734
Tell you what;

01:36.735 --> 01:39.928
you show me yours and I'll show you mine.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.177
There.

02:24.178 --> 02:28.181
Now we can talk
face-to-face.

02:28.182 --> 02:34.020
I understand you have offered
quite a substantial reward

02:34.021 --> 02:36.789
for any kind of relevant
information on Hannibal Lecter,

02:36.790 --> 02:40.026
not just the usual
apprehension and conviction.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.061
Yes, a million dollars.

02:42.062 --> 02:45.198
One million. We advertised worldwide.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.767
High price for a fancy pig.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.069
Hannibal would be a prize pig
if I had him in my hospital,

02:50.070 --> 02:53.773
but you do not intend to see
him institutionalized, do you?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.075
I'm saying nothing that would force you

02:56.076 --> 03:00.213
to break the bonds of
doctor-patient confidentiality.

03:00.214 --> 03:05.084
You do not want a therapist.
You want a profiler.

03:05.085 --> 03:07.086
I want to understand

03:07.087 --> 03:09.789
Hannibal Lecter to
better understand myself.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.591
You survived him.

03:11.592 --> 03:14.056
That is chief amongst what
you need to understand.

03:14.057 --> 03:15.557
"Survived him"?

03:15.829 --> 03:18.498
That implies fortune or skill on my part

03:18.499 --> 03:19.431
that somehow allowed me to live.

03:19.490 --> 03:23.202
This is exactly how he intended me to live.

03:23.203 --> 03:27.203
I know somewhere Dr. Lecter is
going to and fro in the earth

03:27.908 --> 03:29.976
and walking up and down in it,

03:29.977 --> 03:33.313
and very likely having a good, fun time.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.088
How do you relieve the agony

03:42.089 --> 03:45.525
of waiting for Dr. Lecter's capture?

03:45.526 --> 03:49.495
What do you fantasize about?

03:49.496 --> 03:52.498
I wonder what would happen

03:52.499 --> 03:55.968
if Hannibal Lecter was in your hands.

03:55.969 --> 04:02.074
I worry we're heading into
territory not secured by your fee.

04:02.075 --> 04:06.552
I think I need to look elsewhere for
somebody to tend to my emotional well-being.

04:06.553 --> 04:08.610
Good-bye, Dr. Chilton.

04:10.826 --> 04:12.258
Happy hunting.

04:41.016 --> 04:43.284
You were supposed to leave.

04:44.453 --> 04:46.555
We couldn't leave without you.

05:13.081 --> 05:15.450
How do you feel?

05:17.619 --> 05:20.455
Thirsty.

05:33.068 --> 05:37.068
Feel well enough for a visitor?

05:55.190 --> 05:57.525
Hello, Frederick.

05:57.526 --> 06:00.429
You were expecting someone else?

06:03.498 --> 06:06.734
I was hoping for someone else.

06:06.735 --> 06:10.735
He knew exactly how to cut you.

06:11.273 --> 06:14.375
They said it was surgical.

06:14.376 --> 06:16.811
He wanted you to live.

06:16.812 --> 06:20.812
He left us to die.

06:21.516 --> 06:24.552
But we didn't.

06:27.422 --> 06:29.758
Couple of suckers we've been.

06:31.827 --> 06:34.628
He set us up and knocked us down.

06:34.629 --> 06:36.697
What bothers me the most is,

06:36.698 --> 06:38.799
I think it was easy for him.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.335
Shooting monkeys in a barrel.

06:41.336 --> 06:44.372
You had encephalitis.

06:44.373 --> 06:48.542
I do not know what my excuse was.

06:48.543 --> 06:50.811
Compulsive imitation.

06:50.812 --> 06:53.814
How dull!

06:53.815 --> 06:56.684
But maybe.

06:56.685 --> 06:59.654
I am learning all sorts of new
things about myself these days.

07:03.425 --> 07:06.427
I'm learning new things about you, too.

07:06.428 --> 07:10.132
Imitation allows us to better
understand the behavior of others.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.769
I have great empathy for you, Will.

07:14.770 --> 07:17.671
Both of us eviscerated and accused...

07:17.672 --> 07:21.175
I have literally felt your pain.

07:21.176 --> 07:23.445
We have matching scars.

07:25.447 --> 07:27.848
You need a friend...

07:27.849 --> 07:30.851
friend.

07:30.852 --> 07:34.688
You will leave this hospital
under a cloud of suspicion.

07:34.689 --> 07:37.358
Not a cloud, a fog.

07:37.359 --> 07:40.728
I can help you get Hannibal
Lecter out of your head.

07:40.729 --> 07:43.364
And into your hospital.

07:43.365 --> 07:47.068
There's opportunity here...

07:47.069 --> 07:48.669
For both of us.

07:48.670 --> 07:50.704
We can catch the man

07:50.705 --> 07:52.841
who framed and maimed us.

07:56.344 --> 07:58.814
There's no opportunity here, Frederick.

08:02.084 --> 08:04.219
Not for you.

08:08.290 --> 08:10.291
The optimist believes we live in

08:10.292 --> 08:12.460
the best of all possible
worlds; the pessimist

08:12.461 --> 08:16.231
fears this is true.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.501
This is your best possible world, Will.

08:20.502 --> 08:23.271
Not getting a better one.

10:33.435 --> 10:36.571
I had hoped you would come look for me...

10:40.075 --> 10:43.078
But I understand why you didn't.

10:44.813 --> 10:47.348
What can I do for you, Jack?

10:47.349 --> 10:50.217
Well, I'm here to, uh,

10:50.218 --> 10:53.354
make sure that you don't contradict

10:53.355 --> 10:56.323
the official narrative.

10:56.324 --> 10:59.560
Well, we're officers of the FBI,

10:59.561 --> 11:02.697
wounded in the course of heroic duty.

11:05.133 --> 11:08.502
That's not true for either of us.

11:08.503 --> 11:12.072
Well, we were supposed
to go together. That's...

11:12.073 --> 11:15.210
That's on me. My foul. My bad.

11:18.246 --> 11:22.483
Not all of our choices
are consciously calculated.

11:22.484 --> 11:25.786
No...

11:25.787 --> 11:29.224
But our decisions are.

11:35.797 --> 11:39.234
You remember when you
decided to call Hannibal?

11:43.138 --> 11:45.806
I wasn't decided when I called him.

11:45.807 --> 11:49.511
I just called him.

11:51.546 --> 11:54.582
I deliberated while the phone rang.

11:57.285 --> 12:01.156
I decided when I heard his voice.

12:05.293 --> 12:07.828
You told him we knew.

12:07.829 --> 12:11.298
I told him to leave,

12:11.299 --> 12:15.135
'cause I wanted him to run.

12:15.136 --> 12:17.772
Why?

12:29.718 --> 12:32.286
Because...

12:32.287 --> 12:35.857
Because he was my friend.

12:39.594 --> 12:43.098
And because I wanted to run away with him.

13:32.287 --> 13:34.160
What I said before

13:34.619 --> 13:37.555
I will say again,

13:37.556 --> 13:40.692
which is something you cannot say:

13:42.160 --> 13:44.796
that I did not warn you.

13:46.798 --> 13:49.600
Cannot see what you will not see.

13:49.601 --> 13:51.803
Until it shoves you out a window.

13:53.772 --> 13:57.608
I've always enjoyed the
word "defenestration"...

13:57.609 --> 14:01.478
Now I get to use it in casual conversation.

14:01.479 --> 14:05.182
How many bones did you break?

14:05.183 --> 14:07.918
You say that like I broke them.

14:07.919 --> 14:10.521
You got yourself to the window, Dr. Bloom,

14:10.522 --> 14:12.523
if not through it.

14:12.524 --> 14:14.658
They told me a lot of
marrow got into my blood

14:14.659 --> 14:18.062
and that I should expect to find myself

14:18.063 --> 14:20.497
thinking differently.

14:20.498 --> 14:23.702
Hallelujah!

14:26.104 --> 14:29.173
I do not mean to kick
you when you are down.

14:29.174 --> 14:32.943
I'm just reminding you how you got down.

14:32.944 --> 14:36.114
And who I'm down with.

14:39.017 --> 14:41.552
We could all use a little

14:41.553 --> 14:44.688
group therapy while we're down here.

14:44.689 --> 14:46.824
There's only one "we"

14:46.825 --> 14:49.093
you're really interested in, Frederick,

14:49.094 --> 14:52.930
and that "we" isn't
really interested in you.

14:52.931 --> 14:56.501
Will Graham could use a breakthrough.

14:58.536 --> 15:00.537
Being broken was his breakthrough?

15:00.538 --> 15:02.873
Being broken was yours.

15:02.874 --> 15:05.209
Will has not had his breakthrough yet.

15:05.210 --> 15:08.947
He is saving that for Dr. Lecter.

15:10.949 --> 15:14.920
It would be the best thing
for his therapy, really.

15:18.189 --> 15:20.190
It's only a matter of
time before they are back

15:20.191 --> 15:22.259
in each other's orbit.

15:22.260 --> 15:25.996
Shame not to have the good seats,

15:25.997 --> 15:29.833
If only to support poor Will.

15:29.834 --> 15:33.505
That would require some manipulation.

15:35.907 --> 15:39.778
Some English on the ball, as it were.

16:10.742 --> 16:13.645
You were so afraid of me.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.249
The last time I saw you...

16:20.218 --> 16:22.487
Before that last time I saw you...

16:39.237 --> 16:41.639
What are you doing here?

16:45.877 --> 16:48.645
I guess I'm looking for you.

16:48.646 --> 16:51.915
That's a good guess.

16:51.916 --> 16:54.518
What are you doing here?

16:54.519 --> 16:56.888
Mm, visiting old friends.

17:03.495 --> 17:05.996
You're not tempted to forget?

17:05.997 --> 17:10.034
No, I... I don't want to forget.

17:10.035 --> 17:12.770
I'm building rooms in my memory palace

17:12.771 --> 17:15.638
for all my friends.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.675
Friendship is blackmail

17:18.675 --> 17:21.779
elevated to the level of love.

17:21.780 --> 17:23.781
A mutually-unspoken pact

17:23.781 --> 17:26.550
to ignore the worst in one another

17:26.550 --> 17:29.686
in order to continue enjoying the best.

17:29.687 --> 17:32.924
After everything he's done,

17:34.959 --> 17:37.095
can you still ignore the worst in him?

17:40.965 --> 17:43.468
I came here to be alone, Alana.

17:50.141 --> 17:52.977
If you wouldn't mind...

19:04.149 --> 19:07.484
Hello.

19:07.485 --> 19:10.855
I'm Dr. Bloom.

19:13.491 --> 19:17.127
You're the new psychiatrist.

19:17.128 --> 19:20.531
I went one exit too far on the expressway,

19:20.532 --> 19:23.167
came back along the service road.

19:23.168 --> 19:25.636
I'm not sure if this is my entrance...

19:25.637 --> 19:28.906
This can be your entrance.

19:28.907 --> 19:31.910
Isn't easy to find the first time you come.

19:33.912 --> 19:36.647
I'm Margot Verger.

19:36.648 --> 19:40.651
A witchy beauty about this place.

19:40.652 --> 19:43.487
Yes, isn't there?

19:43.488 --> 19:45.789
You should see it in the spring.

19:45.790 --> 19:48.759
The riot of lilacs in the wind smells

19:48.760 --> 19:52.663
nothing at all like the stockyards

19:52.664 --> 19:55.032
and slaughterhouses one usually associates

19:55.033 --> 19:57.768
with the Verger name.

19:57.769 --> 20:00.671
Can you please let your
brother know I'm here?

20:00.672 --> 20:03.641
He knows.

20:10.682 --> 20:12.916
Some people have trouble
talking with Mason,

20:12.917 --> 20:15.686
so if it bothers you

20:15.687 --> 20:17.821
or you can't take it,

20:17.822 --> 20:20.157
I'd be happy to answer any
questions that you have.

20:20.158 --> 20:22.826
- Thank you.
- Margot,

20:22.827 --> 20:25.662
you can leave us now.

20:25.663 --> 20:28.565
If my brother offers you chocolate,

20:28.566 --> 20:32.036
politely refuse.

20:50.221 --> 20:53.258
Ah! Good afternoon, Dr. Bloom.

20:55.727 --> 21:00.097
Good afternoon, Mr. Verger.

21:00.098 --> 21:04.098
You know, I thank God for what happened.

21:04.669 --> 21:07.838
It was my salvation.

21:07.839 --> 21:10.107
Have you accepted Jesus, Dr. Bloom?

21:10.108 --> 21:12.109
Do you have faith?

21:12.110 --> 21:14.778
I was raised in a religious
atmosphere, Mr. Verger,

21:14.779 --> 21:18.048
but whatever that left me
with, it's not religion.

21:18.049 --> 21:20.550
Left me with more.

21:20.551 --> 21:23.053
You see, I'm free, Dr. Bloom.

21:23.054 --> 21:27.491
I'm right with the Risen
Jesus and it's all OK now.

21:27.492 --> 21:31.028
And nobody beats the Riz.

21:31.029 --> 21:34.831
He will rise me up and smite mine enemies

21:34.832 --> 21:38.735
and I shall hear the
lamentations of their women.

21:38.736 --> 21:41.138
That was once you, I'm told.

21:41.139 --> 21:43.240
Dr. Lecter got

21:43.241 --> 21:46.576
deeper inside you than he did any of us.

21:56.621 --> 21:58.889
Do you want me to get the nurse?

21:58.890 --> 22:01.892
No, no, I'm...

22:01.893 --> 22:04.027
I'm fine, now, heh...

22:04.028 --> 22:07.664
It's all OK now.

22:07.665 --> 22:11.735
You're supposed to share
any relevant information

22:11.736 --> 22:14.738
you find on Hannibal Lecter with the FBI.

22:14.739 --> 22:17.040
Huh!

22:17.041 --> 22:19.576
Have you always done that?

22:19.577 --> 22:21.912
Not exactly.

22:21.913 --> 22:24.648
I want you to understand, Dr. Bloom,

22:24.649 --> 22:27.884
that this is not a revenge thing.

22:27.885 --> 22:30.187
I have forgiven Dr. Lecter

22:30.188 --> 22:33.024
as Our Saviour forgave the Roman soldiers.

22:34.926 --> 22:38.196
Forgiveness isn't all it's
cracked up to be, Mr. Verger.

22:40.264 --> 22:45.670
I don't need religion to appreciate
the idea of Old Testament revenge.

22:53.003 --> 22:56.864
- AH! Ah...
- ARGH!

23:39.625 --> 23:43.061
Jack?

23:43.062 --> 23:47.133
Are you there?

23:59.979 --> 24:02.647
Did I die?

24:02.648 --> 24:05.984
You did a lot of things.

24:05.985 --> 24:09.020
Dying may have been among them.

24:09.021 --> 24:11.556
For once,

24:11.557 --> 24:14.125
I'm glad you're stubborn.

24:14.126 --> 24:17.162
What's good for the goose. Ha!

24:17.163 --> 24:20.098
You're not going into
the ground with me, Jack.

24:20.099 --> 24:24.536
So stop trying.

24:24.537 --> 24:27.539
I was dead.

24:27.540 --> 24:31.142
I knew I was dead.

24:31.143 --> 24:35.013
All that was left for me to do was die.

24:35.014 --> 24:38.283
I thought if I could hear your voice,

24:38.284 --> 24:41.120
we both wouldn't have to die alone.

24:45.258 --> 24:48.660
I'm not afraid of dying.

24:48.661 --> 24:51.930
I'm not afraid

24:51.931 --> 24:54.065
of what it will be like to be dead.

24:56.502 --> 24:59.571
I'm... more...

24:59.572 --> 25:03.308
curious...

25:03.309 --> 25:05.577
of any what-ifs

25:05.578 --> 25:09.348
than I am of any absolutes.

25:11.918 --> 25:15.521
You can do something that I can't:

25:18.124 --> 25:21.259
you can cut out

25:21.260 --> 25:24.931
what's killing you.

25:30.036 --> 25:32.404
Every useful hoop our mind can jump through

25:32.405 --> 25:35.174
begins with a certain degree of attention.

25:37.143 --> 25:39.879
Focus is the most important
thing any of us can do.

25:41.614 --> 25:43.949
You...

25:43.950 --> 25:47.218
You are losing focus, Jack.

25:47.219 --> 25:49.220
I have refocused.

25:49.221 --> 25:51.222
Forced retirement at the FBI?

25:51.223 --> 25:53.325
You fall in love with the Bureau,

25:53.326 --> 25:55.360
but it does not fall in love with you.

25:55.361 --> 25:57.963
Behavioral Sciences
doesn't have the resources.

25:57.964 --> 26:00.432
Homeland Security is the priority now.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.901
Terrorists are more
frightening than psychopaths.

26:02.902 --> 26:05.603
Not to me.

26:05.604 --> 26:07.939
Really?

26:07.940 --> 26:11.009
The first thing you did
after getting shot in the face

26:11.010 --> 26:14.512
was copyright "Hannibal the Cannibal."

26:14.513 --> 26:18.249
A catchphrase is a trademark and
protected as a form of property.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.385
You are alive

26:20.386 --> 26:22.620
because you did not pull
that glass from your neck.

26:22.621 --> 26:24.656
Will Graham is alive

26:24.657 --> 26:27.525
because Hannibal Lecter likes him that way.

26:27.526 --> 26:29.527
Maybe it's one of those
friendships that ends

26:29.528 --> 26:32.998
after the disemboweling. I
would argue, with these two,

26:32.999 --> 26:34.966
that's tantamount to flirtation.

26:34.967 --> 26:36.968
Will is going to lead you

26:36.969 --> 26:38.970
- right to him.
- Oh, no he's not. Not to me.

26:38.971 --> 26:43.074
I've let them both go. I've let it all go.

26:43.075 --> 26:47.078
You dangle Will Graham
and now you cut bait?

26:47.079 --> 26:51.283
You're letting Hannibal have
him hook, line and sinker.

26:53.519 --> 26:56.021
You'll excuse me, Dr. Chilton.

26:56.022 --> 26:59.124
I like to be home in the evenings

26:59.125 --> 27:02.128
when my wife wakes up.

27:33.125 --> 27:35.160
Hmm?

30:19.928 --> 30:23.031
Jack?

30:37.411 --> 30:40.447
God, I love you in white.

30:51.825 --> 30:54.094
Jack?

31:03.937 --> 31:06.673
She'll look beautiful.

31:11.445 --> 31:13.947
Bella's dead.

31:16.517 --> 31:20.720
That should change the
view from these windows.

31:20.721 --> 31:24.457
It's not right if the view

31:24.458 --> 31:27.126
stays the same.

31:27.127 --> 31:31.131
It's not right.

33:32.686 --> 33:35.856
I'm so sorry about Bella, Jack.

34:20.567 --> 34:24.070
I opened my eyes this morning

34:24.071 --> 34:26.105
and at that moment,

34:26.106 --> 34:29.507
before the weight of the day came for me,

34:29.509 --> 34:33.847
I didn't even think about Bella dying.

34:36.583 --> 34:40.120
I still think she was hoping to
die while I was out of the room,

34:42.155 --> 34:44.690
but...

34:44.690 --> 34:47.860
I was there when her heart stopped.

34:47.860 --> 34:50.797
And I held onto her until her brain died.

34:53.166 --> 34:56.135
I hope she's somewhere today, Jack,

34:56.136 --> 34:59.605
and that she's comfortable.

34:59.606 --> 35:04.044
I hope she can see it in my heart.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.585
She had to die on me.

35:12.586 --> 35:15.654
I knew it was coming,

35:15.655 --> 35:19.626
but it still smarts.

35:26.133 --> 35:28.901
I know what's coming for you, Will.

35:28.902 --> 35:32.739
You don't have to die on me, too.

35:56.663 --> 35:59.666
Ow!

36:07.541 --> 36:09.542
Ow...

36:09.543 --> 36:13.079
- I'm saying "ow"!
- Blood is flowing.

36:13.080 --> 36:16.682
Nerves are intact.

36:16.683 --> 36:19.652
Pain is a good thing.

36:19.653 --> 36:22.088
This is why you can never legally work

36:22.089 --> 36:25.091
in the health industry, Cordell.

36:25.092 --> 36:27.560
They were going to throw you away.

36:27.561 --> 36:29.829
You would have been wasted.

36:29.830 --> 36:31.831
Ow...

36:31.832 --> 36:34.066
Scar tissue

36:34.067 --> 36:37.670
is an awesome demonstration
of self-preservation.

36:37.671 --> 36:40.706
The flesh's fight to exist,

36:40.707 --> 36:43.109
down to the most basic cell,

36:43.110 --> 36:46.078
is a wonder.

36:46.079 --> 36:48.514
At Communions around the earth,

36:48.515 --> 36:50.850
the devout believe that through the miracle

36:50.851 --> 36:53.652
of transubstantiation,

36:53.653 --> 36:57.056
they eat the flesh and blood of Christ.

36:57.057 --> 37:00.126
It is an impressive ceremony.

37:00.127 --> 37:03.829
I need to prepare an even
more impressive ceremony

37:03.830 --> 37:06.700
with no transubstantiation necessary.

37:10.403 --> 37:13.806
Cordell, I have known you
to be absolutely reliable

37:13.807 --> 37:17.077
and capable of almost
anything. Is that true?

37:19.079 --> 37:21.547
It is not untrue.

37:21.548 --> 37:23.616
I pay you a large salary

37:23.617 --> 37:27.486
to be responsible for my care and feeding.

37:27.487 --> 37:30.156
And all that that entails.

37:30.157 --> 37:32.892
All that that entails.

37:32.893 --> 37:35.828
I would like you to begin arrangements

37:35.829 --> 37:39.166
for Dr. Hannibal Lecter to be eaten alive.

37:41.134 --> 37:43.602
Do you have a preference

37:43.603 --> 37:46.739
for how you would like him prepared?

37:46.740 --> 37:49.141
Oh, Cordell...

37:49.142 --> 37:52.479
If I had lips, I would smile.

38:39.559 --> 38:41.653
Good as new.

38:49.137 --> 38:53.193
All this time he eludes
us... he got away clean!

38:53.393 --> 38:56.010
It's as though Hannibal Lecter
has dropped off the earth.

38:56.711 --> 39:00.213
Hannibal obviously has
good papers and money.

39:00.214 --> 39:03.483
Europe is where a man of
his tastes would settle.

39:03.484 --> 39:05.485
Well, his tastes

39:05.486 --> 39:07.754
are very specific.

39:07.755 --> 39:11.191
And that's how you'll find him.

39:11.192 --> 39:14.327
- Oh?
- The wine,

39:14.328 --> 39:16.463
the truffles...

39:16.464 --> 39:19.366
Taste in all things

39:19.367 --> 39:22.469
will be a constant
between Dr. Lecter's lives.

39:22.470 --> 39:25.772
His name will change,
but his taste will not.

39:25.773 --> 39:29.444
Of course you know what he would favour.

39:31.379 --> 39:33.613
Tell me, Dr. Bloom,

39:33.614 --> 39:36.951
does he favour you?

39:38.920 --> 39:41.521
I think I amused him.

39:41.522 --> 39:44.791
Things either amuse him or
they don't. And if they don't...

39:44.792 --> 39:47.494
Well, you didn't.

39:49.530 --> 39:51.932
Do you feel he ever

39:51.933 --> 39:54.234
genuinely cared for you?

39:54.235 --> 39:58.235
I have no idea how Dr. Lecter
genuinely feels about me.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.641
Last time we spoke,

40:01.642 --> 40:04.511
he promised he'd kill me.

40:04.512 --> 40:07.747
Huh... So, tell me:

40:07.748 --> 40:09.783
how does it feel to use understanding

40:09.784 --> 40:12.419
as a predator's tool?

40:12.420 --> 40:15.288
I'm using it as I've always used it...

40:15.289 --> 40:17.557
A psychiatric tool.

40:22.263 --> 40:25.665
Why not take this to Jack Crawford?

40:25.666 --> 40:27.934
Jack's done at the FBI; a footnote

40:27.935 --> 40:30.904
in his own Evil Minds Museum.

40:30.905 --> 40:33.406
I'm curious, Dr. Bloom,

40:33.407 --> 40:36.676
how I have found you in my pocket.

40:36.677 --> 40:39.379
Do tell.

40:39.380 --> 40:43.885
I'm all ears... they've
just been... redistributed.

40:46.254 --> 40:49.190
You're preparing the
theatre of Hannibal's death.

40:51.459 --> 40:54.362
I'm just doing my part
to get him to the stage.

41:31.499 --> 41:33.867
Where's Will?

41:33.868 --> 41:36.336
He's already gone, Jack.

41:36.337 --> 41:39.439
Will knows what he has to do.

41:41.096 --> 41:42.560
Do you?
