00:28.646 --> 00:29.746
_

00:52.778 --> 00:54.711
Maryam!

00:55.948 --> 00:58.582
Oh, Ana.

00:59.936 --> 01:01.036
_

01:02.933 --> 01:04.033
_

01:05.033 --> 01:08.208
_

01:48.734 --> 01:50.635
All countries participating

01:50.636 --> 01:52.003
in the free speech resolution summit

01:52.004 --> 01:54.772
are confirmed and should be
in Vancouver by tomorrow.

01:54.773 --> 01:56.908
China agreeing to come back
to the table is a huge deal,

01:56.909 --> 01:58.276
so this will be a
sizeable press event.

01:58.277 --> 02:00.178
I've already sent you your remarks.

02:00.179 --> 02:01.879
Though, technically,
you could say whatever you want

02:01.880 --> 02:03.448
because that's the whole
point of the conference.

02:03.449 --> 02:04.816
- Free speech.
- And, of course,

02:04.817 --> 02:07.518
the assistant secretary for
East Asia and Pacific Affairs

02:07.519 --> 02:08.686
will be by your side.

02:08.687 --> 02:10.988
But if-if you need
anything at all from us...

02:10.989 --> 02:15.059
Guys, thanks. I really
appreciate all of your concern,

02:15.060 --> 02:17.795
but believe it or not,
there was a time in my life

02:17.796 --> 02:19.797
when I travelled without you.

02:19.798 --> 02:21.833
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

02:21.834 --> 02:23.835
Sorry I'm late, ma'am,
but I was on a very,

02:23.836 --> 02:26.537
very troubling call with
our embassy in Abkhazia.

02:26.538 --> 02:27.872
What's up?

02:27.873 --> 02:31.275
Um, the police raided an
LGBTQ nightclub in Sukhumi.

02:31.276 --> 02:34.645
They locked everyone up
on trumped-up charges

02:34.646 --> 02:36.080
of prostitution

02:36.081 --> 02:37.615
and resisting arrest.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.350
Isn't that, like, the
fifth raid this month?

02:39.351 --> 02:40.551
That we've heard about.

02:40.552 --> 02:41.953
Exactly.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.655
Um, there are reports
of beatings, torture

02:44.656 --> 02:48.426
and, in some cases, death,
all while in police custody.

02:48.427 --> 02:52.663
All of these people
disappeared after the raid

02:52.664 --> 02:54.966
and even if they were lucky
enough to evade the authorities

02:54.967 --> 02:57.702
and are in hiding,
it's only a matter of time

02:57.703 --> 02:59.070
before they're hunted down.

02:59.071 --> 03:03.341
I'm alarmed, but not surprised.

03:03.342 --> 03:06.811
Abkhazia legalized
homosexuality, what, a year ago?

03:06.812 --> 03:08.980
After they gained full independence.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.082
Not like they're happy about it.

03:11.083 --> 03:12.784
Ma'am, asylum seekers at our embassy

03:12.785 --> 03:16.187
are saying this is a pogrom
against the LGBTQ community.

03:16.188 --> 03:18.389
Well, let's find out if that's true.

03:18.390 --> 03:21.025
I can reach out to Brent Rosen.

03:21.026 --> 03:24.128
He's now the executive director
at the Human Crisis Foundation.

03:24.129 --> 03:26.497
They usually have solid,
on-the-ground Intel

03:26.498 --> 03:28.065
with LGBTQ issues.

03:28.066 --> 03:29.934
Okay, good.

03:29.935 --> 03:34.005
I'm gonna have a chat
with President Lakoba.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.274
Let him know that we're watching.

03:36.275 --> 03:38.176
- Kat, would you please join?
- Absolutely, ma'am.

03:38.177 --> 03:39.477
We have it

03:39.478 --> 03:42.113
on good authority that
your LGBTQ citizens

03:42.114 --> 03:44.081
are being targeted for persecution.

03:44.082 --> 03:46.884
These are false tales
made up by devils.

03:46.885 --> 03:48.352
I'm assuring you,

03:48.353 --> 03:52.824
no innocent citizens have been target

03:52.825 --> 03:54.859
or harmed in any way.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.527
"Innocent citizens"?

03:56.528 --> 03:58.763
Mr. President, in your country,

03:58.764 --> 04:01.766
homosexuality is not a crime.

04:01.767 --> 04:04.502
I strongly recommend

04:04.503 --> 04:06.237
your government respect its own laws

04:06.238 --> 04:07.939
and allow your LGBTQ citizens

04:07.940 --> 04:09.340
to live freely.

04:09.341 --> 04:12.443
LGB... letters, letters, letters.

04:12.444 --> 04:14.879
Well, maybe you'll respond
better to numbers.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.613
So, here's a big one:

04:16.615 --> 04:17.982
$60 million.

04:17.983 --> 04:19.916
The amount that your country agreed

04:19.918 --> 04:21.952
to give us in aid each year.

04:21.954 --> 04:24.188
Then you're also aware
that aid is contingent

04:24.189 --> 04:26.357
on meeting certain human
rights conditions,

04:26.358 --> 04:30.595
including ensuring the
rights of gay people.

04:30.596 --> 04:32.663
Are you understanding me better now?

04:32.664 --> 04:37.001
I'm afraid it is you who doesn't
understand, Madam Secretary.

04:37.002 --> 04:40.503
What you are saying is impossible.

04:42.307 --> 04:46.409
We don't have gays in Abkhazia.

04:48.881 --> 04:51.249
No gays in Abkhazia?

04:51.250 --> 04:52.717
It's sick.

04:52.718 --> 04:55.186
The guy could've passed a polygraph,

04:55.187 --> 04:57.989
his hate was that true.

04:57.990 --> 05:00.458
You know what I hate?

05:00.459 --> 05:01.492
His hair.

05:01.493 --> 05:03.194
His hair!

05:03.195 --> 05:04.862
- I mean...
- Ugh!

05:04.863 --> 05:07.665
I just want to get in there or blech!

05:07.666 --> 05:09.700
Hey, shouldn't you be packing
for this conference thing?

05:09.701 --> 05:11.969
No, come on. It's more fun
just hanging out with you,

05:11.970 --> 05:14.171
drinking wine and complaining.

05:14.172 --> 05:16.007
How was your day?

05:16.008 --> 05:18.242
Well, I got a lot of important
work done down in the basement

05:18.243 --> 05:21.212
- after the great flood.
- Uh-huh.

05:21.213 --> 05:23.981
What? What?

05:23.982 --> 05:27.952
No, it's just... since
you quit the CIA,

05:27.953 --> 05:29.654
you've been spending a lot of time

05:29.655 --> 05:31.921
down in the basement, alone.

05:33.258 --> 05:36.060
Just tell me you're not going
crazy and writing a manifesto.

05:36.061 --> 05:38.763
They called me today.

05:38.764 --> 05:40.498
CIA?

05:40.499 --> 05:45.069
Mm-hmm. They want to give me a
commendation for some reason.

05:45.070 --> 05:47.638
Like, because you deserve it?

05:47.639 --> 05:51.342
Yeah, or they know I was driven
to quit by political BS.

05:51.343 --> 05:52.476
They didn't back me up

05:52.477 --> 05:54.946
and now they want to make
themselves feel better.

05:54.947 --> 05:58.382
Yeah, no. CIA doesn't
really do regret.

05:58.383 --> 06:01.953
Yeah. Well, anyway, um,
it's a small ceremony.

06:01.954 --> 06:03.387
Timing's up to me.

06:03.388 --> 06:05.056
So, what are you thinking?

06:05.057 --> 06:08.025
I haven't decided, but probably,

06:08.026 --> 06:09.727
you know, never.

06:09.728 --> 06:14.565
Oh. 'Cause you're too busy
alone down in the basement?

06:14.566 --> 06:15.733
I'm not gonna be alone.

06:15.734 --> 06:16.968
I'm gonna get the kids to help me.

06:16.969 --> 06:18.135
Hey, kids! Come here a minute!

06:18.136 --> 06:19.437
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

06:19.438 --> 06:21.339
- Putting in a new floor, babe.
- Coming. One sec.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.307
- Whoa.
- Here, check this out.

06:23.308 --> 06:25.242
Anything speak to you?

06:25.243 --> 06:26.477
Oh. That one.

06:29.715 --> 06:31.349
Hey, Blake.

06:31.350 --> 06:34.352
Uh, what's the name of
the opera that, uh,

06:34.353 --> 06:35.853
the musical Rent's based on?

06:35.854 --> 06:37.788
- La bohÃ¨me.
- Oh.

06:37.789 --> 06:39.857
And what's the holiday
that Chandler hates?

06:39.858 --> 06:42.827
Chandler Bing? Thanksgiving.

06:42.828 --> 06:45.162
And what's the name of the
American songwriting duo

06:45.163 --> 06:47.164
that wrote "Hound Dog"
and "Jailhouse Rock"?

06:47.165 --> 06:48.432
I know what you're doing.

06:48.433 --> 06:50.568
I heard you grilling Daisy
in the break room yesterday.

06:50.569 --> 06:52.737
And just because I know the
answer... Leiber and Stoller...

06:52.738 --> 06:54.138
doesn't mean I have any desire

06:54.139 --> 06:55.673
to join your sad little trivia team.

06:55.674 --> 06:58.342
Sad? Buddy, I am proud
to say that we are

06:58.343 --> 07:00.644
one of the top teams
in D.C.'s pub circuit.

07:00.645 --> 07:02.880
You do know what the word
"proud" means, don't you?

07:02.881 --> 07:06.384
And believe me, crushing
those smug Ivy Leaguers

07:06.385 --> 07:10.021
for that sweet trivia "W"
is quite an achievement.

07:10.022 --> 07:12.189
Considering I don't like
who you just became,

07:12.190 --> 07:14.258
- I'm gonna pass.
- Okay.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.293
Do I get competitive?

07:16.294 --> 07:18.662
Sure. That's why Pete quit.

07:18.663 --> 07:20.564
Also, Pete's a quitter and a baby.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.266
Lesson learned.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.768
Captain Ronnie and I
are down a teammate...

07:23.769 --> 07:25.302
- Stop.
- ...during the week of an invitational.

07:25.303 --> 07:27.772
Captain Ronnie Baker from CYBERCOM?

07:27.773 --> 07:29.040
Okay, to be clear,

07:29.041 --> 07:32.076
she is not the captain of
The Bill of Right Answers.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.144
That would be me.

07:33.145 --> 07:35.880
Oh, Matt.

07:35.881 --> 07:37.448
When did it all go so wrong?

07:37.449 --> 07:38.849
Oh, come on.

07:38.850 --> 07:40.785
Don't you want to put your
powers of pop culture

07:40.786 --> 07:43.220
and theater to better use
than just making references

07:43.221 --> 07:45.089
that fly over the secretary's head?

07:45.090 --> 07:47.058
You're right. They kind of do.

07:47.059 --> 07:49.126
- Yeah.
- All right.

07:49.127 --> 07:51.062
- Mm-hmm?
- Theoretically, what's in it for me?

07:51.063 --> 07:54.832
Well, first prize is
dinner for the entire team

07:54.833 --> 07:57.134
at Le Petit Chien.

07:57.135 --> 07:59.804
Michelin star, Le Petit Chien?

07:59.805 --> 08:03.407
Stupid expensive, impossible
to get reservations,

08:03.408 --> 08:06.910
except for the winners of
O'Reilly's Pub Trivia Night.

08:08.580 --> 08:10.781
I told you this was serious business.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.348
So?

08:13.452 --> 08:14.752
Fine, I'm in.

08:14.753 --> 08:16.520
Yes! To victory!

08:16.521 --> 08:19.255
Viva la vida bohÃ¨me!

08:21.293 --> 08:22.793
That's from La bohÃ¨me.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.696
It's the opera that Rent's
based off of. That's...

08:25.697 --> 08:28.298
Wow, you need me more than I thought.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.236
The police yelled

08:32.236 --> 08:33.904
that I should be killed for being gay.

08:35.573 --> 08:38.509
And threw me into a
cell covered in blood.

08:38.510 --> 08:42.145
I waited four hours,
certain I was going to die.

08:43.849 --> 08:45.916
They beat me

08:45.917 --> 08:49.019
all over my body.

08:50.989 --> 08:54.524
Pliers were connected to my genitals.

08:56.228 --> 08:58.462
They electrocuted me.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.735
They wanted me to confess.

09:04.736 --> 09:07.036
Say I'm gay.

09:09.508 --> 09:12.209
And wanted names of others.

09:17.215 --> 09:19.917
The police left this man
outside his family's house,

09:19.918 --> 09:23.053
bloody and beaten...

09:23.054 --> 09:25.189
and then they outed
him to his parents.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.558
My God.

09:27.559 --> 09:29.460
Somehow, he got himself

09:29.461 --> 09:32.429
to an Abkhazian LGBTQ coalition.

09:32.430 --> 09:33.664
They've moved their
offices underground.

09:33.665 --> 09:37.001
So, how do we make Lakoba stop?

09:37.002 --> 09:39.336
Withhold aid, look at sanctions.

09:39.337 --> 09:41.906
Economic levers take time.

09:41.907 --> 09:44.542
Is the coalition in communication

09:44.543 --> 09:47.011
with the people in
hiding or on the run?

09:47.012 --> 09:48.345
Yes, they are.

09:48.346 --> 09:51.549
Secretly, over a website for
a fake T-shirt company.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.217
So, how many are they in touch with?

09:53.218 --> 09:56.153
Well, between the coalition
safe houses and the website,

09:56.154 --> 09:59.190
only about 90. Why?

09:59.191 --> 10:01.492
Is there any chance that
we could give them asylum?

10:01.493 --> 10:04.028
Homeland Security is backlogged.

10:04.029 --> 10:05.262
There's no way to fast-track

10:05.263 --> 10:07.264
the three to five
year processing time.

10:07.265 --> 10:08.465
Yeah, so we're gonna go through

10:08.466 --> 10:10.334
our refugee resettlement program,

10:10.335 --> 10:11.802
but that could still take

10:11.803 --> 10:14.371
18 to 24 months. Of course.

10:14.372 --> 10:18.542
Okay. First, we need to ratchet
up pressure on Lakoba.

10:18.543 --> 10:19.743
Talk to the White House

10:19.744 --> 10:22.379
about issuing a statement
condemning these activities,

10:22.380 --> 10:24.815
formally withdrawing aid.

10:24.816 --> 10:28.452
Meantime, we need a
mechanism to save the lives

10:28.453 --> 10:29.453
that we can save.

10:29.454 --> 10:30.654
Uh, like, uh, like what?

10:30.655 --> 10:34.091
Find an LGBTQ-friendly
country to take them in

10:34.092 --> 10:35.812
while Homeland Security
reviews their cases.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.463
Ma'am. Your motorcade is waiting
to take you to Andrews.

10:39.464 --> 10:42.800
In today's climate, i-it's not easy

10:42.801 --> 10:45.336
to find a country that's willing
to take in any refugees at all.

10:45.337 --> 10:49.706
Then find one that owes us, and fast.

10:52.043 --> 10:58.437
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

11:08.137 --> 11:11.104
It's just so ironic.

11:13.209 --> 11:17.011
You're asking Bulgaria to
open its borders to hundreds,

11:17.012 --> 11:20.348
potentially thousands of
unvetted foreign nationals

11:20.349 --> 11:22.984
so that the United
States can have time

11:22.985 --> 11:24.385
to complete its own vetting.

11:24.386 --> 11:26.154
Unfortunately,

11:26.155 --> 11:29.290
we can't accelerate the United
States's resettlement policy

11:29.291 --> 11:31.292
just for one group of refugees.

11:31.293 --> 11:34.896
Lucky for them,
Bulgaria is so free and easy.

11:34.897 --> 11:36.264
We would be extremely grateful

11:36.265 --> 11:38.466
for Bulgaria's cooperation.

11:38.467 --> 11:39.844
And again, the secretary regrets

11:39.845 --> 11:41.145
she is not able to join us today,

11:41.146 --> 11:42.780
but hopes that we can find a way

11:42.781 --> 11:44.615
to help these people.

11:44.616 --> 11:47.485
You are asking Bulgaria to risk

11:47.486 --> 11:50.221
taking in unvetted dissidents?

11:50.222 --> 11:54.425
Uh, refugees seeking
political asylum, Minister.

11:54.426 --> 11:56.093
- Due to persecution...
- Technically, yes, we're asking you

11:56.094 --> 11:57.662
to assume an element of risk.

11:57.663 --> 11:59.897
Just like last year,
when Russian troops

11:59.898 --> 12:02.033
were on your shores and
the U.S. stepped in

12:02.034 --> 12:04.936
and helped prevent your
nation from being invaded.

12:04.937 --> 12:07.138
As a fellow member of NATO, Minister,

12:07.139 --> 12:09.340
we're now asking for
Bulgaria's cooperation,

12:09.341 --> 12:11.742
not based on your gratitude
for us saving your butts,

12:11.743 --> 12:16.314
but because of your
compassion for those in need.

12:16.315 --> 12:18.082
But either works.

12:18.083 --> 12:21.785
I'll talk to the prime minister.

12:23.522 --> 12:27.391
We will allow the UNHRC
to set up refugee camps

12:27.392 --> 12:29.560
outside of Plovdiv.

12:29.561 --> 12:31.796
Thank you, Minister Dragova.

12:31.797 --> 12:35.900
Give my regards to the secretary.

12:43.008 --> 12:45.141
Oh. Thank you.

12:46.278 --> 12:49.146
Jason McCord,
you're wanted in the office.

12:49.147 --> 12:50.548
Ooh!

12:50.549 --> 12:53.985
All right, settle down, settle down.

12:53.986 --> 12:56.821
Okay.

12:56.822 --> 12:59.023
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

12:59.024 --> 13:00.958
Hey, man.

13:00.959 --> 13:02.426
Hey. You get the material yet?

13:02.427 --> 13:03.861
Yeah, I'm putting together a
binder on Bulgaria as we...

13:03.862 --> 13:05.896
No, I meant the study packet
for team trivia night.

13:05.897 --> 13:08.366
Look, I e-mailed it to
you a couple hours ago.

13:08.367 --> 13:10.368
Uh, yeah. I-I got it.

13:10.369 --> 13:11.636
Did you look it over?

13:11.637 --> 13:12.737
You know what?

13:12.738 --> 13:14.071
- What?
- I actually did.

13:14.072 --> 13:15.506
- It's so cool.
- Oh, way to go, teamie...

13:15.507 --> 13:16.574
I'm lying, you idiot.

13:16.575 --> 13:17.775
We're trying to save refugees

13:17.776 --> 13:19.043
from a homophobic, murderous dictator.

13:19.044 --> 13:20.211
Okay, yeah, yeah. Work.

13:20.212 --> 13:22.513
I know you think you got
this team trivia stuff,

13:22.514 --> 13:25.349
but I promise you, you don't got this.

13:25.350 --> 13:27.885
Ivy League overachievers who've
been obnoxiously dominating

13:27.886 --> 13:29.020
dinner conversations

13:29.021 --> 13:30.488
since they were four years old?

13:30.489 --> 13:32.223
Please. I went to class with them.

13:32.224 --> 13:34.225
I avoided joining...

13:34.226 --> 13:35.893
clubs with them.
I'm probably unwilling to admit

13:35.894 --> 13:37.328
that I actually am one of them.

13:37.329 --> 13:38.429
Believe me, I got this.

13:38.430 --> 13:39.597
Okay.

13:39.598 --> 13:41.599
Play it like you don't care.

13:41.600 --> 13:42.633
That's cool.

13:42.634 --> 13:43.701
Different is good.

13:43.702 --> 13:45.269
The best teams are spice racks.

13:45.270 --> 13:46.270
Do you hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

13:46.271 --> 13:47.938
We will be the tagine of trivia.

13:47.939 --> 13:49.073
Tagine is a Moroccan stew.

13:49.074 --> 13:50.174
It's in the packet. I...

13:50.175 --> 13:51.742
Okay. Get back to work.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.977
Hey. You're gonna be great.

14:01.186 --> 14:03.087
Jace?

14:03.088 --> 14:04.121
Yeah.

14:04.122 --> 14:05.256
Perfect timing.

14:05.257 --> 14:06.457
I'm just about to start on the floor.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.625
You can give me a hand.

14:07.626 --> 14:09.794
Look at this. Mom
chose, uh... and Ali...

14:09.795 --> 14:11.462
chose this wood-look porcelain tile.

14:11.463 --> 14:12.763
What do you think?

14:12.764 --> 14:14.498
Yeah, looks great.

14:14.499 --> 14:15.833
You okay, pal?

14:15.834 --> 14:17.902
Yeah, um...

14:17.903 --> 14:19.637
Yeah, sorry, I'm just out of it.

14:19.638 --> 14:21.005
Well, grab something to drink.

14:21.006 --> 14:22.606
Sit down for a minute.
I don't want to break

14:22.607 --> 14:23.774
any child labor laws.

14:23.775 --> 14:26.844
Mm. Oh, there's pizza in there.

14:26.845 --> 14:29.380
My advice to you is eat
as much pizza as you can

14:29.381 --> 14:31.014
before you're 30.

14:31.783 --> 14:34.317
Ah, hell, bring me a piece, would you?

14:38.924 --> 14:40.291
You know what?

14:41.893 --> 14:43.394
I just remembered I
have debate practice.

14:43.395 --> 14:45.129
What?

14:45.130 --> 14:46.197
Yeah. No.

14:46.198 --> 14:47.665
Uh...

14:47.666 --> 14:48.966
They-they changed my
schedule this morning.

14:48.967 --> 14:50.334
It's my fault, I-I totally spaced.

14:50.335 --> 14:52.602
But I'm sorry, I got to...

14:55.207 --> 14:56.440
That was it?

14:56.441 --> 14:57.842
He just took off?

14:57.843 --> 14:59.443
Yeah, he didn't even try to argue

14:59.444 --> 15:01.612
his way out of it, he just
pulled this debate story.

15:01.613 --> 15:02.713
Something is up.

15:02.714 --> 15:05.082
- Yeah, well, he's a teenager.
- Welcome.

15:05.083 --> 15:08.252
You know, something is-is always up.

15:08.253 --> 15:10.287
Hey, I'm just trying to get
the basement finished.

15:10.288 --> 15:12.456
I mean, yeah, okay, I'm annoyed.

15:12.457 --> 15:13.891
He said he would help me out.

15:13.892 --> 15:15.459
He should keep his word.

15:15.460 --> 15:16.694
I totally agree.

15:16.695 --> 15:19.764
I mean, I hated helping
my father with projects.

15:19.765 --> 15:20.998
He was the worst.

15:20.999 --> 15:22.600
I would lie like hell
to get out of it.

15:22.601 --> 15:25.369
But that's why I try to
be better, you know?

15:25.370 --> 15:27.705
I talk, I'm patient, I offer snacks.

15:27.706 --> 15:29.607
I think he's just a teenager,

15:29.608 --> 15:34.712
and we are a l-little
less interesting now.

15:34.713 --> 15:37.681
It's nature's way of
making him leave the house

15:37.682 --> 15:39.250
when he graduates.

15:39.251 --> 15:41.418
Yeah. That didn't work out
so well with the other two.

15:42.487 --> 15:43.988
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

15:43.989 --> 15:46.390
I love you, I got to go. Bye.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.027
I feel like we should celebrate.

15:50.028 --> 15:52.329
Chinese?

15:52.330 --> 15:53.798
Oh, hell yes.

15:53.799 --> 15:56.801
The number of my meals that come
out of that vending machine

15:56.802 --> 15:58.502
would make the mothers
of the world cringe.

15:58.503 --> 16:02.373
Yikes. Well, as a parent
and sometime-farmer,

16:02.374 --> 16:04.975
I'm telling you: you... yeah, you
got to eat real food. That is...

16:04.976 --> 16:06.944
Uh...

16:06.945 --> 16:08.279
You have a kid?

16:08.280 --> 16:09.580
Yeah.

16:09.581 --> 16:11.348
Desi.

16:11.349 --> 16:13.517
Short for Desear.

16:13.518 --> 16:15.653
A moody, adorable threenager.

16:15.654 --> 16:18.522
So you with me in the
single parent club, or...?

16:18.523 --> 16:20.624
Uh, no. No.

16:20.625 --> 16:24.328
Actually, I co-parent
with Desi's dad, Adam.

16:24.329 --> 16:25.629
He's consulting at the moment.

16:25.630 --> 16:28.666
But um, you know,
he's finding his way,

16:28.667 --> 16:31.569
now that I, uh,
dragged him back to D.C.

16:36.508 --> 16:37.808
What?

16:37.809 --> 16:43.047
I just... I assumed,
that with the refugees,

16:43.048 --> 16:44.647
it was personal.

16:48.286 --> 16:50.521
It is. I'm bisexual.

16:50.522 --> 16:54.425
Uh, you can also say
pansexual, or-or fluid,

16:54.426 --> 16:58.696
or non-monosexual,
but, uh, yeah, I'm queer.

16:59.865 --> 17:01.599
Okay. Okay.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.001
I know I'm wandering into
foot in mouth territory here,

17:04.002 --> 17:07.238
but queer is really... sorry...

17:07.239 --> 17:10.007
is really just about...
it's about worldview, right?

17:10.008 --> 17:13.210
Or is it more sexual preference?

17:13.211 --> 17:16.079
Um...

17:16.080 --> 17:17.414
You know, I think it means

17:17.415 --> 17:19.148
different things to different people.

17:19.150 --> 17:21.484
But for me,

17:21.486 --> 17:25.955
it's about the freedom to
live my gender identity,

17:25.957 --> 17:28.425
and expression, as well
as my sexual orientation.

17:28.425 --> 17:30.794
I'm just gonna say stuff now.

17:30.795 --> 17:32.529
Mm, okay, go for it.

17:32.530 --> 17:34.999
So when you, uh...

17:35.000 --> 17:37.668
were in your U.N. chief
of staff days...

17:37.669 --> 17:38.969
Mm-hmm.

17:38.970 --> 17:42.506
You know, you looked, uh...

17:42.507 --> 17:43.974
Feminine?

17:43.975 --> 17:45.075
You can say it.

17:45.076 --> 17:46.777
Different. Oh.

17:46.778 --> 17:48.312
Yeah, I like that. "Different."

17:48.313 --> 17:50.314
Yeah, I... yeah,

17:50.315 --> 17:51.782
I had long hair and, uh,

17:51.783 --> 17:53.684
wore dresses and heels and makeup.

17:53.685 --> 17:57.988
- And, um, sometimes it felt like me.
- Yeah?

17:57.989 --> 18:00.557
And sometimes...

18:00.558 --> 18:03.193
it felt like a costume I had to wear

18:03.194 --> 18:06.697
in order to survive, and gain access.

18:06.698 --> 18:10.200
So what made you... this you?

18:10.201 --> 18:12.536
I survived and gained access.

18:12.537 --> 18:14.238
Fair.

18:14.239 --> 18:16.674
So, now I don't have to
fit in to play the game.

18:16.675 --> 18:21.011
I make my own rules, and number
one is being my authentic self.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.280
Somehow, becoming a parent

18:23.281 --> 18:25.115
only made it feel
more vital, you know?

18:25.116 --> 18:27.551
- Yeah. I get that.
- Yeah?

18:27.552 --> 18:30.220
Having Chloe was, like,
a total reboot for me.

18:30.221 --> 18:31.741
It's amazing how it
affects you, right?

18:32.857 --> 18:34.158
From the first moment I met Desi,

18:34.159 --> 18:36.026
this precious little spirit

18:36.027 --> 18:38.262
looking right into me...

18:39.331 --> 18:41.999
...living my truth
became nonnegotiable.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.568
'Cause I want Desi to
live Desi's truth.

18:47.439 --> 18:49.673
So crazy that people want to destroy

18:49.674 --> 18:51.608
other people for this...
yeah, get in there.

18:51.609 --> 18:53.310
Yeah. Well,

18:53.311 --> 18:56.312
at least we try to get to
do something about it.

18:57.949 --> 19:00.351
You know, it's not the first
time I've worked with Brent.

19:00.352 --> 19:01.418
No?

19:01.419 --> 19:04.088
You know, the nuclear
treaty with Iran?

19:04.089 --> 19:05.522
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:05.523 --> 19:07.424
- Historic deal.
- Damn right.

19:07.425 --> 19:10.327
So, on the same day as the signing,

19:10.328 --> 19:14.631
Iran held a public
execution of a gay man.

19:14.632 --> 19:16.100
Azad Ahmadi.

19:16.101 --> 19:18.068
There was a protest in D.C.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.837
I didn't want it to happen.

19:19.838 --> 19:22.773
The execution or the protest;
they were the same in my mind.

19:22.774 --> 19:26.810
Just obstacles to getting
this thing that we'd been

19:26.811 --> 19:28.212
trying to land for years.

19:28.213 --> 19:29.580
Yeah, it's understandable.

19:29.581 --> 19:30.748
Not really.

19:30.749 --> 19:32.850
As Brent made very clear.

19:32.851 --> 19:35.986
By the time I got "woke..."

19:35.987 --> 19:40.656
and tried to stop the execution,
it was too late.

19:42.660 --> 19:46.063
We all have to put up walls
sometimes to do this work.

19:46.064 --> 19:47.931
That one had a cost.

19:47.932 --> 19:50.567
He was stoned to death.

19:50.568 --> 19:52.136
I made myself watch the video.

19:52.137 --> 19:54.638
Oh, my God. Why?

19:54.639 --> 19:58.174
So I'd never forget.

19:58.910 --> 20:00.477
Hey. Lakoba responded

20:00.478 --> 20:01.812
to the president's public statement.

20:01.813 --> 20:02.913
He just closed the borders.

20:02.914 --> 20:04.214
- No.
- What?

20:04.215 --> 20:06.583
Yeah, the refugees are
trapped in Abkhazia.

20:06.584 --> 20:08.885
Oh, my God.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.045
We found out that
they're putting people

20:21.046 --> 20:23.006
in a specially designated
prison center.

20:23.007 --> 20:26.148
Oh. Well, that sounds eerily
similar to a concentration camp.

20:26.149 --> 20:28.350
Our contacts on the ground
are all scrambling.

20:28.351 --> 20:29.885
President Lakoba is now threatening

20:29.886 --> 20:33.188
to expel all U.S. headquartered NGOs.

20:33.189 --> 20:36.024
And now, the LGBTQ Coalition is
worried that the authorities

20:36.025 --> 20:37.792
are gonna find out about
their underground office

20:37.793 --> 20:39.060
and their website,

20:39.061 --> 20:40.462
and so they're shutting it all down.

20:40.463 --> 20:41.696
They can't do that.

20:41.697 --> 20:43.165
We won't be able to reach
the people in hiding.

20:43.166 --> 20:45.400
That's why we need State to intervene.

20:45.401 --> 20:46.701
Time is running out.

20:46.702 --> 20:47.802
We're dealing with a guy who says

20:47.803 --> 20:49.538
his country has "no gays."

20:49.539 --> 20:50.705
We can't negotiate with that.

20:50.706 --> 20:52.574
And there's no legal
way to get them out

20:52.575 --> 20:54.942
without violating
Abkhazian sovereignty.

20:55.878 --> 20:58.312
Then maybe we need to
start finding other ways.

21:01.817 --> 21:04.586
Okay, human traffickers?

21:04.587 --> 21:05.820
You're kidding.

21:05.821 --> 21:07.455
Yeah, of course I'm kidding.

21:07.456 --> 21:09.558
I mean, t-they're the
most evil monsters

21:09.559 --> 21:10.959
belched from Hell the
Earth has ever known.

21:10.960 --> 21:11.993
Although...

21:11.994 --> 21:13.094
- Stop.
- Th-They... well...

21:13.095 --> 21:14.329
We may not have any legal options,

21:14.330 --> 21:17.132
but we're not going to
straight up immoral.

21:17.133 --> 21:19.868
Right. So just plain illegal.

21:19.869 --> 21:21.636
Extralegal.

21:21.637 --> 21:25.407
Okay. So...

21:25.408 --> 21:29.411
who can help us transport
humans extralegally

21:29.412 --> 21:31.613
who isn't a human trafficker?

21:34.483 --> 21:36.351
Kurdish smugglers.

21:36.352 --> 21:38.220
Now you're kidding.

21:38.221 --> 21:39.888
Sure, the Turks might be a little mad

21:39.889 --> 21:41.289
that we're working
with their archenemies

21:41.290 --> 21:43.792
- on their own soil...
- Yeah, like "threaten-threaten NATO" mad.

21:43.793 --> 21:46.528
True.

21:48.097 --> 21:49.698
They could.

21:49.699 --> 21:52.334
They could. They could
transport our refugees

21:52.335 --> 21:55.303
by ground from Abkhazia to
Bulgaria via Georgia and Turkey.

21:55.304 --> 21:57.105
Are we really having
this conversation?

21:57.106 --> 21:58.974
- Just hypothetically.
- Okay, okay.

21:58.975 --> 22:00.709
So, hypothetically, the tricky part is

22:00.710 --> 22:02.210
- how do we pay them?
- Yeah.

22:04.247 --> 22:07.215
Unless we don't.

22:07.216 --> 22:08.817
Oh, my God.

22:09.919 --> 22:11.820
You want me to convince an NGO

22:11.821 --> 22:13.622
that's working in Eastern Europe

22:13.623 --> 22:15.790
to accept a grant

22:15.791 --> 22:19.427
that they will then use
to pay Kurds to transport

22:19.428 --> 22:22.197
LBGTQ refugees through Turkey?

22:22.198 --> 22:25.100
Another country that
hates LBGTQ people?

22:25.101 --> 22:28.403
Yes. Except the NGO will never
know where the money came from,

22:28.404 --> 22:30.472
and we never had this conversation.

22:30.473 --> 22:33.408
Aside from being completely insane,

22:33.409 --> 22:36.911
your-your plan has a-a Turkey problem.

22:36.912 --> 22:38.847
Under President Kozlu,

22:38.848 --> 22:40.872
it's basically an authoritarian state,

22:40.873 --> 22:42.251
and they hate the Kurds.

22:42.252 --> 22:44.019
Like "attempted to ethnically
cleanse them" hate.

22:44.020 --> 22:47.054
We're up to speed. We know the risks.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.861
Did the secretary sign off on this?

22:56.399 --> 22:59.768
Brent, the secretary's
not your problem.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.536
Right now, this is our only option,

23:01.537 --> 23:02.604
and the clock is ticking.

23:02.605 --> 23:05.239
If we do nothing, these people die.

23:11.013 --> 23:13.981
I'll have my team start making calls.

23:15.885 --> 23:17.851
Thank you.

23:19.255 --> 23:22.691
We better notify the secretary.

23:22.692 --> 23:25.193
It's 5:00 in Vancouver.
She's still in negotiations.

23:25.194 --> 23:28.929
Right. She'll be tied
up a few more hours.

23:30.733 --> 23:31.900
And we can't wait.

23:31.901 --> 23:32.934
Let's get everything in motion,

23:32.935 --> 23:34.615
and I'll fill her in
as soon as they break.

23:36.138 --> 23:37.706
I am Dr. Punkaj,

23:37.707 --> 23:39.708
but I'm not a medical doctor.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.676
So no bumps, bruises or contusions.

23:41.677 --> 23:44.045
What have you gotten me into?

23:44.046 --> 23:46.214
Now, on to our first question.

23:46.215 --> 23:48.183
Get you something? Popcorn shrimp?

23:48.184 --> 23:49.351
Oh, uh, yeah.

23:49.352 --> 23:50.552
You know, I...
Now's not the time, lady.

23:50.553 --> 23:53.555
In the 2000s, which artist

23:53.556 --> 23:56.558
sold more albums than the Beatles?

23:56.559 --> 23:58.693
Where's the buzzer?

23:58.694 --> 24:00.228
Oh, no, this isn't Jeopardy!, dude.

24:00.229 --> 24:02.397
Okay, we write it all down and
then turn it in at the end.

24:02.398 --> 24:03.431
Well, that's not exciting.

24:03.432 --> 24:05.100
Blake, the question. Jay-Z? Yeah.

24:05.101 --> 24:09.371
Eminem. I should have known that.

24:09.372 --> 24:10.972
Who wrote the 2004 hit

24:10.973 --> 24:14.542
Mean Girls?

24:14.543 --> 24:16.411
- Amy Poehler?
- Oh, please. Tina Fey.

24:16.412 --> 24:17.979
Oh. Tina Fey.

24:17.980 --> 24:19.748
This How I Met Your Mother star

24:19.749 --> 24:21.449
also played Toby...

24:21.450 --> 24:23.784
In Sweeney Todd.

24:25.187 --> 24:26.488
No, no, no.

24:26.489 --> 24:27.589
This is my night off.

24:27.590 --> 24:28.790
I'm not answering any more questions

24:28.791 --> 24:29.991
until you two loosen up.

24:29.992 --> 24:31.025
We're-we're loose.

24:31.026 --> 24:33.026
- Who played Toby, Blake?
- Yeah.

24:34.597 --> 24:36.297
Could we have a round
of shots, please?

24:36.298 --> 24:37.631
Surprise us.

24:39.368 --> 24:42.470
You know, I once ate fried beer.

24:43.639 --> 24:45.473
- No.
- Yeah, it's a thing.

24:45.474 --> 24:47.308
- My family's from Texas.
- Oh.

24:47.309 --> 24:49.778
We figured that out when
you said "fried beer."

24:49.779 --> 24:53.114
- Hey, you better watch it, Matty.
- No judgment.

24:53.115 --> 24:54.749
- Just a little judgment.
- Oh.

24:54.750 --> 24:55.817
Shh!

24:55.818 --> 24:58.486
- Okay, what is your problem?
- Hey, no, no, no.

24:58.487 --> 25:01.156
73% of the brain

25:01.157 --> 25:02.791
is made up of this.

25:02.792 --> 25:04.626
- Ooh, um...
- Oh...

25:04.627 --> 25:06.694
- Uh, it's a plasma...
- It's a liquid, clear, uh...

25:06.695 --> 25:09.431
- Waters? Waters.
- Yes!

25:09.432 --> 25:11.666
I think we've had a
few too many shots.

25:11.667 --> 25:13.067
Edgar Allan Poe died

25:13.068 --> 25:14.369
in this mid-Atlantic city.

25:14.370 --> 25:16.604
- "The Raven." Uh, "Nevermore."
- No, that's, uh...

25:16.605 --> 25:17.372
Baltimore.

25:17.373 --> 25:18.572
Boom!

25:20.342 --> 25:21.843
Thanks for seeing me, Uncle Will.

25:21.844 --> 25:23.511
Anytime, okay?

25:23.512 --> 25:26.181
I won't make you say it.

25:26.182 --> 25:27.816
I know why you're here.

25:27.817 --> 25:28.950
Really?

25:28.951 --> 25:31.386
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

25:31.387 --> 25:33.288
You can't talk to your
parents about everything,

25:33.289 --> 25:34.823
and it's embarrassing
to buy them yourself.

25:34.824 --> 25:36.491
- Oh, God, no.
- No, it's okay.

25:36.492 --> 25:37.792
- I got 'em from the clinic.
- No, no, no, that's...

25:37.793 --> 25:39.494
- Should see you through the month.
- No, Uncle Will...

25:39.495 --> 25:41.796
There's a big jump in
STDs in your age group.

25:41.797 --> 25:43.064
- Syphilis is back.
- No, no, no.

25:43.065 --> 25:45.332
No, I'm good, thanks.

25:47.570 --> 25:49.903
Well, what's on your mind?

25:52.308 --> 25:54.474
You okay?

25:56.679 --> 25:59.481
I got a perfect score on the PSAT.

25:59.482 --> 26:00.648
What?

26:02.918 --> 26:05.420
- That's it.
- Okay. Wow.

26:05.421 --> 26:07.522
Do you have any idea what Elizabeth

26:07.523 --> 26:09.090
and Henry McCord are going to do

26:09.091 --> 26:11.226
- when they find out?
- They will be very proud.

26:11.227 --> 26:12.660
No, they'll freak out...

26:12.661 --> 26:14.362
and start having all
these expectations.

26:14.363 --> 26:17.966
Ah.

26:17.967 --> 26:20.001
And you won't don a
mask of faux ambition

26:20.002 --> 26:21.135
to appease the herd?

26:21.136 --> 26:23.103
Thank you.

26:24.306 --> 26:25.473
I have a plan.

26:25.474 --> 26:28.510
Piper's looking at colleges.

26:28.511 --> 26:30.612
And once I graduate, I'm just gonna go

26:30.613 --> 26:34.182
wherever she is, and I'll
get a job in the same town.

26:34.183 --> 26:35.517
And...

26:35.518 --> 26:38.552
No "and."

26:40.222 --> 26:43.091
Steve Jobs, Howard
Hughes, Lady Gaga...

26:43.092 --> 26:45.460
none of them had a college degree,

26:45.461 --> 26:47.729
and they built empires.

26:47.730 --> 26:49.297
But if they didn't have an "and,"

26:49.298 --> 26:50.865
they wouldn't have
accomplished anything.

26:50.866 --> 26:52.633
You need an "and."

26:55.037 --> 26:57.872
I just don't want to be forced
to be someone I'm not, you know?

26:57.873 --> 26:59.073
You get it.

26:59.074 --> 27:01.209
I came to you

27:01.210 --> 27:03.411
because you gave up your
life to be with a woman.

27:03.412 --> 27:04.746
All right, you get it, man.

27:04.747 --> 27:07.749
Look, I-I gave up kidnapping threats,

27:07.750 --> 27:10.218
air raids, 24/7 gunfire,

27:10.219 --> 27:13.721
but I'm still doing the thing
that-that makes me tick.

27:13.722 --> 27:15.290
Okay, yeah.

27:15.291 --> 27:18.159
And you're near Aunt Sophie,
and I want that.

27:19.662 --> 27:21.663
This perfect score has just
thrown everything up in the air,

27:21.664 --> 27:23.197
and I can only keep it hidden

27:23.198 --> 27:25.900
from Mom and Dad for so long...

27:25.901 --> 27:27.302
and then it's just gonna be nonstop

27:27.303 --> 27:28.903
Harvard this and Stanford that.

27:28.904 --> 27:30.939
And, "Why don't you apply
for this internship

27:30.940 --> 27:33.474
- and that fellowship?"
- And I...

27:33.475 --> 27:35.610
I don't want any of it.

27:35.611 --> 27:37.644
Come here, I want to
show you something.

27:42.851 --> 27:44.218
Brent's connections came through.

27:44.219 --> 27:46.621
- They found a willing NGO?
- Yep. Rainbow Georgia.

27:46.622 --> 27:48.189
They already had some
ties to a Kurdish group.

27:48.190 --> 27:50.325
We can get about 60
people out of Abkhazia.

27:50.326 --> 27:53.027
When? When are they... when?

27:53.028 --> 27:54.495
It's happening now.

27:54.496 --> 27:57.564
Wow.

28:05.975 --> 28:12.084
_

28:21.924 --> 28:24.191
_

28:28.344 --> 28:29.911
_

28:30.657 --> 28:31.798
_

28:57.019 --> 28:59.053
What up, champ?

28:59.054 --> 29:00.889
- Oh, boy.
- Give me some.

29:00.890 --> 29:02.223
We high-fiving now?

29:02.224 --> 29:04.259
Oh, damn straight, teamie.

29:04.260 --> 29:06.561
We were on a trivia team
together... it was very exciting.

29:06.562 --> 29:08.596
- We won.
- Okay, that's good.

29:08.597 --> 29:12.066
So, Captain Ronnie and I
are thinking Monday night

29:12.067 --> 29:13.501
- for our winner dinner.
- Yeah.

29:13.502 --> 29:15.317
Well, all right, well, I'll be there.

29:15.318 --> 29:17.486
I have been dreaming, dreaming about

29:17.487 --> 29:18.954
the cheese cart at Le Petit Chien.

29:18.955 --> 29:20.856
Cool. And Wednesday,
we keep the dream alive

29:20.857 --> 29:21.857
at Ken's Bar and Grille.

29:21.858 --> 29:23.258
Oh, no, no, no.

29:23.259 --> 29:24.226
That dream is over.

29:24.227 --> 29:26.628
I had a great time. I really did.

29:26.629 --> 29:30.465
But I was just in it for the
free Michelin star meal.

29:30.466 --> 29:32.267
I actually have a life.

29:32.268 --> 29:34.336
Whoa, dude.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.305
You're acting like I'm using trivia

29:36.306 --> 29:38.974
to fill some void or distract myself

29:38.975 --> 29:40.509
from feeling a little
stalled out lately

29:40.510 --> 29:42.477
'cause my love life is
nonexistent, and sometimes

29:42.478 --> 29:44.379
the loneliness in my apartment
feels like a prison.

29:44.380 --> 29:48.116
Matt, do you not realize

29:48.117 --> 29:50.018
that Captain Baker is into you?

29:50.019 --> 29:51.887
Ronnie?

29:51.888 --> 29:54.488
- Yeah.
- No.

29:56.859 --> 29:58.327
Y-You think?

29:58.328 --> 30:00.963
Let me put it to you this way.

30:00.964 --> 30:03.632
This popular '90s movie
is a modern adaptation

30:03.633 --> 30:05.167
of Jane Austen's Emma. Clueless.

30:05.168 --> 30:06.667
That's you.

30:08.905 --> 30:11.240
I can't ask her out.

30:11.241 --> 30:14.243
She... it'd be too weird.

30:14.244 --> 30:16.610
We're on the same trivia team.

30:19.515 --> 30:23.418
What if I just happen to
be sick on Monday night?

30:23.419 --> 30:25.587
Wait, no, you'd miss out

30:25.588 --> 30:28.023
on Le Petit Chien's cheese cart

30:28.024 --> 30:30.125
and-and the famous crabe royal

30:30.126 --> 30:33.094
to give me a personal
round with Ronnie?

30:34.797 --> 30:38.132
You should walk away
before I change my mind.

30:48.344 --> 30:50.279
Hey. Um, any word?

30:50.280 --> 30:52.247
No. Brent said he'd call as
soon as he hears anything.

30:52.248 --> 30:54.615
Yeah, but shouldn't he have
heard something by now?

30:56.252 --> 30:58.020
Okay, the secretary's on her way back.

30:58.021 --> 31:00.055
Vancouver did not go as
well as we had hoped.

31:00.056 --> 31:02.124
Yeah, because we hoped for
a free speech resolution

31:02.125 --> 31:03.225
and didn't get one.

31:03.226 --> 31:05.027
So more like it didn't go well at all.

31:05.028 --> 31:07.262
Guys, China agreed to resume
talks in a few months.

31:07.263 --> 31:08.497
So, for the press briefing,

31:08.498 --> 31:09.865
make sure it doesn't
sound like we're just

31:09.866 --> 31:11.033
spinning our wheels
with the resolution.

31:11.034 --> 31:12.067
Even though we are?

31:12.068 --> 31:14.336
What? Is it really
worth trying to sell

31:14.337 --> 31:15.637
abject failure as anything else?

31:15.638 --> 31:17.205
Just say Rome wasn't built in a day,

31:17.206 --> 31:19.341
and, like Rome, this too is
an ongoing process, okay?

31:19.342 --> 31:21.308
I know how to handle
the briefing, Jay.

31:22.679 --> 31:24.980
Of course. Sorry.

31:24.981 --> 31:28.616
What's the status of the
Abkhazian refugees?

31:30.586 --> 31:33.355
Something up?

31:33.356 --> 31:34.990
We're still waiting on an update.

31:34.991 --> 31:37.392
Well, considering our lack
of progress with Vancouver,

31:37.393 --> 31:39.561
maybe we should mention our
efforts with the refugees.

31:39.562 --> 31:41.496
It's humanitarian headline gold.

31:41.497 --> 31:42.531
If we're successful.

31:42.532 --> 31:43.699
We need to keep the story on ice

31:43.700 --> 31:44.866
while we help others escape.

31:44.867 --> 31:46.419
Hopefully, this is just
the first wave of many.

31:46.420 --> 31:49.036
- Copy that.
- Thanks.

31:54.610 --> 31:56.878
I keep telling myself
we did the right thing,

31:56.879 --> 31:58.714
but Brent's voice is stuck in my head

31:58.715 --> 32:00.515
saying if this thing goes sideways,

32:00.516 --> 32:02.450
we threaten our foreign policy.

32:03.786 --> 32:06.955
I talked to the
secretary, and basically,

32:06.956 --> 32:10.724
as long as the refugees make
it to Bulgaria, we're good.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.767
Welcome back, ma'am.

32:18.768 --> 32:22.971
I need Jay and Kat in my office, now.

32:22.972 --> 32:25.507
Couple of miles from the border,

32:25.508 --> 32:30.178
a Turkish army unit raided a
Kurdish transport vehicle.

32:30.179 --> 32:34.916
The refugees you were trying
to save are being detained.

32:34.917 --> 32:36.718
President Kozlu plans

32:36.719 --> 32:41.456
on deporting them back to
Abkhazia within the hour.

32:41.457 --> 32:43.592
- What? He can't do that.
- He is doing that.

32:43.593 --> 32:46.595
And he is furious that we
worked with the Kurds.

32:46.596 --> 32:48.764
You know, being that they're
sworn enemies and all.

32:48.765 --> 32:52.033
Ma'am, there's no proof that
they worked at our behest.

32:52.034 --> 32:53.135
H-Here's the funny thing:

32:53.136 --> 32:55.504
you know that LGBTQ-friendly NGO,

32:55.505 --> 32:57.806
Rainbow Georgia, that you worked with?

32:57.807 --> 32:59.908
One of their employees gave us up.

32:59.909 --> 33:03.245
Why? He hates Kurds.

33:03.246 --> 33:07.015
You see, being righteous
in one area doesn't mean

33:07.016 --> 33:09.518
that you are righteous in all areas.

33:09.519 --> 33:13.688
Which is why you have to know
who you are working with.

33:13.689 --> 33:16.091
Ma'am, I take full
responsibility for this.

33:16.092 --> 33:18.226
No, no, no, no. I made the call.
It's my fault.

33:18.227 --> 33:19.127
- Well, I brought it...
- It's my fault.

33:19.128 --> 33:21.029
I'm not listening to this

33:21.030 --> 33:22.864
because right now,

33:22.865 --> 33:25.066
we need to save these refugees

33:25.067 --> 33:28.969
and our relationship
with a vital ally.

33:30.807 --> 33:33.508
Okay, I'll gather the team,
and we'll put together...

33:33.509 --> 33:34.576
No need.

33:34.577 --> 33:37.212
This is how this is going to play out.

33:37.213 --> 33:38.747
I'm going to browbeat President Kozlu,

33:38.748 --> 33:43.218
using our historic
alliance as leverage.

33:43.219 --> 33:45.220
Course, he has the upper hand

33:45.221 --> 33:48.056
because he knows we will
never allow those refugees

33:48.057 --> 33:49.991
to return to Abkhazia.

33:49.992 --> 33:53.295
Not to mention China and Russia,

33:53.296 --> 33:57.165
who are looking to exploit
even the slightest fracture

33:57.166 --> 34:01.303
in our relationship in order
to peel the Turks off of NATO.

34:01.304 --> 34:04.473
So, sorry, Jay,

34:04.474 --> 34:07.676
your garden-variety
inducements of more F-22s

34:07.677 --> 34:12.079
and monetary aid just
isn't gonna cut it.

34:14.884 --> 34:18.719
Instead, I will be forced
to offer up something

34:18.721 --> 34:19.955
that hurts.

34:19.956 --> 34:22.657
Like softening the language

34:22.658 --> 34:25.193
in State's next human rights report.

34:25.194 --> 34:27.795
If President Kozlu

34:27.797 --> 34:30.632
allows the Abkhazians

34:30.632 --> 34:32.601
to continue on to Bulgaria,

34:32.601 --> 34:35.036
we will give him the
credit that he deserves.

34:35.036 --> 34:38.172
And then we will look for other areas

34:38.174 --> 34:42.777
to less harshly condemn
Turkey for abuses.

34:42.777 --> 34:44.846
Ma'am, anything less than a
full-throated condemnation

34:44.847 --> 34:46.114
will only encourage Kozlu

34:46.114 --> 34:47.248
to keep crossing lines.

34:47.250 --> 34:48.516
It would look like we're reneging

34:48.518 --> 34:49.717
on our commitment to democracy

34:49.719 --> 34:51.619
and getting in bed with
a burgeoning autocrat.

34:52.889 --> 34:56.391
If either of you has a better idea,

34:56.391 --> 34:59.893
I am all ears.

35:02.465 --> 35:04.933
Great.

35:06.536 --> 35:09.303
Blake, get me President Kozlu.

35:11.040 --> 35:13.040
Thank you. That's all.

35:27.177 --> 35:29.479
Hey, Dad, I've, uh,
got something to tell you.

35:29.480 --> 35:32.115
Let me guess, you got a
perfect score on your PSAT.

35:32.116 --> 35:33.950
- Uncle Will sold me out?
- Nope.

35:33.951 --> 35:36.352
I got a congratulatory
e-mail from your principal.

35:36.353 --> 35:39.322
The only thing I can think
of is that since you're...

35:39.323 --> 35:42.058
you know, you, instead
of being thrilled,

35:42.059 --> 35:44.761
you'd think that somehow
Mom and I are gonna have these

35:44.762 --> 35:46.162
crazy expectations of you.

35:46.163 --> 35:48.998
First of which is:

35:48.999 --> 35:52.969
we expect honesty and, well,
at least not outright lying.

35:52.970 --> 35:55.138
- I know. I'm an idiot. I'm sorry.
- No, no, hey.

35:55.139 --> 35:57.373
No, it's just I...

35:57.374 --> 35:58.882
I wasn't ready to tell you

35:58.883 --> 36:00.484
and I didn't want to lie by omission,

36:00.485 --> 36:02.152
so I just avoided
spending time with you.

36:02.153 --> 36:04.221
- Which was, obviously, pretty dumb...
- Okay, first of all...

36:04.222 --> 36:05.922
...because I ended up
lying to you anyway.

36:05.923 --> 36:08.458
Congratulations.

36:08.459 --> 36:11.194
And I promise that the next
time you do something great,

36:11.195 --> 36:13.797
I will think as little
of you as possible.

36:13.798 --> 36:15.432
I assume you already told Mom.

36:15.433 --> 36:16.566
Yeah, she's pretty proud.

36:16.567 --> 36:18.201
Uh, but she has no expectations

36:18.202 --> 36:19.503
- it'll lead to anything.
- No.

36:19.504 --> 36:21.371
It's-it's not that. It's...

36:21.372 --> 36:23.206
I don't know what I want to do yet.

36:23.207 --> 36:25.876
You know, my-my "thing."

36:25.877 --> 36:27.377
I don't want to be
bombarded with options

36:27.378 --> 36:29.179
that I'm gonna have to choose
from and then live up to

36:29.180 --> 36:30.414
only to find that, like, I don't want,

36:30.415 --> 36:31.548
I don't want to do that thing.

36:31.549 --> 36:33.383
And then I have to,
like, find other stuff

36:33.384 --> 36:35.197
that I'm into and-and then
I have to live up to that.

36:35.198 --> 36:36.007
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:36.008 --> 36:37.554
- And it just keeps...
- Whoa, here, slow down.

36:37.555 --> 36:39.388
Have a set. Sit down.

36:40.591 --> 36:43.360
Nobody is making you do anything.

36:43.361 --> 36:44.494
And I get it.

36:44.495 --> 36:47.130
I-I was just as confused as you are

36:47.131 --> 36:48.398
when I was your age.

36:48.399 --> 36:49.766
Really?

36:49.767 --> 36:52.702
Because you and Mom are, like,

36:52.703 --> 36:55.172
the two least confused,

36:55.173 --> 36:57.174
most successful,

36:57.175 --> 36:58.508
amazing people I know.

36:58.509 --> 37:00.776
- Jace...
- It's true.

37:02.413 --> 37:05.315
Well, that must feel
pretty intimidating.

37:05.316 --> 37:08.118
Yeah. Well, look.

37:08.119 --> 37:10.020
Mom and I each had our own journey,

37:10.021 --> 37:12.022
and you're gonna have a
journey that's unique to you.

37:12.023 --> 37:14.758
The big difference between you and me,

37:14.759 --> 37:16.393
besides you being much smarter,

37:16.394 --> 37:17.928
is that, when I was your age,

37:17.929 --> 37:21.198
I was certain of one thing,
I wanted to stick it to my dad.

37:21.199 --> 37:23.233
So the first chance I got,
I joined the Marines

37:23.234 --> 37:26.036
without any idea where
it would lead to, none.

37:26.037 --> 37:28.705
Wait, you did that with no plan?

37:28.706 --> 37:29.639
Yup.

37:29.640 --> 37:33.110
And, oh, did I get lucky

37:33.111 --> 37:35.479
'cause I-I found that I
liked the challenge.

37:35.480 --> 37:38.881
I liked being part of
something bigger than myself.

37:40.318 --> 37:43.220
Maybe I should join the military.

37:43.221 --> 37:45.856
Maybe.

37:45.857 --> 37:49.992
You don't have to decide anything yet.

37:51.395 --> 37:53.897
Life...

37:53.898 --> 37:56.766
doesn't come looking for you.

37:56.767 --> 38:00.069
At a certain point, you just
got to go out and find it.

38:02.173 --> 38:03.707
I should've just talked to you first.

38:03.708 --> 38:05.909
Uncle Will was far less patient.

38:05.910 --> 38:07.744
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

38:07.745 --> 38:09.312
Uh, what-what?

38:09.313 --> 38:11.681
Well, he took me to the
rehab floor at Walter Reed.

38:11.682 --> 38:14.384
Wow. Dose of perspective.

38:14.385 --> 38:15.951
Yeah, but...

38:18.623 --> 38:20.957
Some of them are just a
few years older than me.

38:20.958 --> 38:23.827
Like, they're heroes.

38:23.828 --> 38:27.997
A-And I don't even feel like I
deserve to see them like that.

38:29.333 --> 38:30.800
You're gonna find your thing.

38:30.801 --> 38:33.603
And I promise to expect nothing

38:33.604 --> 38:37.541
if you promise to get in the game.

38:37.542 --> 38:40.577
When you're ready.

38:40.578 --> 38:42.678
Thanks.

38:44.315 --> 38:46.249
That would explain

38:46.250 --> 38:49.753
the text I got from Will:
"You're welcome."

38:49.754 --> 38:51.721
I mean, I appreciate that
he's there for Jace,

38:51.722 --> 38:53.990
but maybe next time he
won't use wounded soldiers

38:53.991 --> 38:56.026
as shock therapy.

38:56.027 --> 38:57.994
I don't know.

38:57.995 --> 39:01.064
I'm still stuck on this.

39:01.065 --> 39:05.202
I don't know, him feeling
all this pressure

39:05.203 --> 39:07.537
because of us? I mean, that stinks.

39:07.538 --> 39:10.006
Well, look, we all have
baggage from our parents.

39:10.007 --> 39:11.875
Having your mom be Secretary of State

39:11.876 --> 39:13.877
is pretty cool baggage.

39:13.878 --> 39:15.879
He'll figure it out.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.614
Yeah.

39:17.615 --> 39:20.383
Hey, speaking of figuring it out...

39:20.384 --> 39:23.320
any more thoughts on
that commendation?

39:23.321 --> 39:24.921
I'm trying not to think about it.

39:24.922 --> 39:25.772
They want to give me

39:25.773 --> 39:28.091
the National Intelligence
Distinguished Service Medal.

39:28.092 --> 39:32.128
Henry! That is an incredible honor

39:32.129 --> 39:34.331
and hugely deserved.

39:34.332 --> 39:36.266
But it's for individual achievement.

39:36.267 --> 39:38.501
It just doesn't feel right.

39:38.502 --> 39:40.202
Well, what would feel right?

39:41.205 --> 39:43.673
It is with great
privilege that I present

39:43.674 --> 39:48.178
the National Intelligence
Meritorious Unit Citation

39:48.179 --> 39:50.213
to recognize the accomplishments

39:50.214 --> 39:52.782
of this group

39:52.783 --> 39:55.252
that significantly benefitted

39:55.253 --> 39:57.821
the intelligence community.

39:57.822 --> 39:59.155
Thanks, Ephraim.

39:59.156 --> 40:03.727
Uh, Henry, you can say a
few words if you'd like

40:03.728 --> 40:05.829
for the record.

40:05.830 --> 40:07.097
Oh, um...

40:07.098 --> 40:12.035
We... appreciate this honor and...

40:12.036 --> 40:14.771
you know, a leader is
only as good as his team.

40:14.772 --> 40:16.940
And... Dylan, Molly,

40:16.941 --> 40:19.542
and Alexander, Nafisa,
those who couldn't be here,

40:19.543 --> 40:22.311
they all made me look
pretty damn good.

40:23.581 --> 40:27.816
You know, to say this job is
difficult is an understatement.

40:30.288 --> 40:33.023
We put our lives on
the line every day,

40:33.024 --> 40:34.524
trying to achieve something

40:34.525 --> 40:37.727
that all too often seems impossible.

40:37.728 --> 40:39.663
Working in gray areas

40:39.664 --> 40:43.665
that make us confront our
sense of right and wrong.

40:44.769 --> 40:49.338
And sometimes, it makes it
pretty hard to sleep at night.

40:51.609 --> 40:54.411
But we keep doing it, every day,

40:54.412 --> 40:57.180
because we believe that,
in our own small way...

41:08.025 --> 41:10.359
...we're helping make the
world a better place.

41:13.531 --> 41:15.531
I can only hope that we are.

41:22.573 --> 41:24.874
Good news.

41:24.875 --> 41:28.044
63 Abkhazians just
arrived at the U.N. camp

41:28.045 --> 41:32.148
- in Plovdiv, Bulgaria.
- Thank God.

41:32.149 --> 41:34.284
- Thank you, ma'am.
- That's great news.

41:34.285 --> 41:36.853
Yeah, they will be safe there

41:36.854 --> 41:39.956
while the DHS reviews
their applications

41:39.957 --> 41:42.759
for resettlement.

41:42.760 --> 41:45.295
Then there's the bad news.

41:45.296 --> 41:48.331
I just came from Acting
President Hurst's office.

41:48.332 --> 41:51.701
Apparently, President Lakoba
feels that we violated

41:51.702 --> 41:54.070
his country's sovereignty,

41:54.071 --> 41:56.139
and he is making threats

41:56.140 --> 41:58.174
to end the military cooperation

41:58.175 --> 42:00.610
that we launched when they
gained their independence.

42:00.611 --> 42:01.945
So now,

42:01.946 --> 42:04.247
instead of working on how to help

42:04.248 --> 42:06.483
the thousands of LGBTQ citizens

42:06.484 --> 42:09.119
still in Abkhazia,

42:09.120 --> 42:12.555
I have to save our strategic
position in the caucuses.

42:12.556 --> 42:14.424
For the record,

42:14.425 --> 42:16.860
we believed it was the only
way to save the refugees.

42:16.861 --> 42:18.427
I'm sure you did.

42:19.530 --> 42:22.265
But diplomacy is about
the big picture,

42:22.266 --> 42:24.233
and you lost sight of that.

42:29.874 --> 42:32.709
You are both important to my team.

42:32.710 --> 42:35.078
You don't get to make a
mistake like that twice.

42:35.079 --> 42:36.212
Understood?

42:36.213 --> 42:39.948
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah, yes, understood.

42:43.454 --> 42:45.754
Blake, get me President Lakoba.

42:51.155 --> 42:58.755
