WEBVTT

01:12.964 --> 01:14.657
One minute to showtime!

01:14.793 --> 01:17.195
AUDIENCE
BroZone! BroZone!

01:17.331 --> 01:19.431
BroZone! BroZone! BroZone!

01:19.567 --> 01:21.229
We love you, BroZone!

01:21.365 --> 01:24.766
All right, guys, we're gonna
open with "Girl, Baby, Baby"

01:24.902 --> 01:27.010
and close with
"Baby, Baby, Girl."

01:27.146 --> 01:28.475
Wait, no,
that doesn't sound right.

01:28.611 --> 01:30.806
Ooh! I got it.
Open with "Baby, Baby, Girl,"

01:30.941 --> 01:33.814
close with
"Baby, Baby, Girl, Woman."

01:33.950 --> 01:35.448
Yes!

01:35.583 --> 01:37.584
We are gonna make
boy band history tonight.

01:37.719 --> 01:39.885
-  510. 511. 512.
- Love it, brother.

01:40.020 --> 01:42.489
I want to see a hundred more
of those by showtime, Spruce.

01:42.624 --> 01:45.023
Those abs need to be
poppin', baby!

01:45.158 --> 01:47.362
Oh, come on.

01:47.497 --> 01:49.564
God, I want to boil an egg
on those abs.

01:49.700 --> 01:53.332
John Dory, do I really have to
keep wearing these things?

01:53.468 --> 01:55.036
Yes, you do, Clay.

01:55.171 --> 01:56.269
They're funderdrawers.

01:56.404 --> 01:58.341
It's underwear but 76% more fun.

01:58.476 --> 02:00.303
Now, let's see
those dance moves, brother.

02:00.438 --> 02:01.903
Fine. Rusty Robot,

02:02.039 --> 02:04.877
into Wiggle Worm,
end on Caliente Puppet.

02:05.012 --> 02:06.014
Yeah.

02:06.149 --> 02:07.844
Bro, you look stressed. Breathe.

02:07.979 --> 02:10.052
Well, of course I'm stressed, Floyd.

02:10.187 --> 02:11.485
It's the first show of the tour.

02:11.620 --> 02:14.021
We have to hit
the perfect family harmony.

02:14.156 --> 02:15.625
We promised the fans.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.653
Okay, calm down.

02:16.788 --> 02:18.027
You're making Baby Branch nervous.

02:18.162 --> 02:19.293
AUDIENCE
BroZone!

02:19.429 --> 02:20.856
- BroZone!
What? Nervous?

02:20.991 --> 02:22.863
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

02:22.998 --> 02:24.764
He's not allowed to be nervous.
He's got to be perfect.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.802
Cut him some slack, John Dory.
It's his first show.

02:27.938 --> 02:29.634
Oh, come on, abs!

02:29.769 --> 02:31.473
Hey, Branch. How you feeling?

02:31.609 --> 02:34.978
I feel like I'm gonna barf
and pass out and...

02:35.113 --> 02:36.108
And pee your pants all at once?

02:36.244 --> 02:37.639
How'd you know?

02:37.774 --> 02:39.282
Ah, you got the preshow jitters.

02:39.417 --> 02:41.351
Completely normal.
Everyone gets 'em.

02:41.486 --> 02:43.713
You want to know what I do
when I get 'em?

02:43.849 --> 02:45.651
Barf, pass out
and pee your pants?

02:45.786 --> 02:47.551
I remember that
I'm with my brothers

02:47.686 --> 02:49.191
and that when we come together,

02:49.326 --> 02:51.153
there is nothing
that we can't do.

02:51.289 --> 02:54.493
But no one's ever hit the
perfect family harmony before.

02:54.628 --> 02:57.262
Is it true
it can shatter diamonds?

02:57.398 --> 02:58.694
Yeah. It's that powerful.

02:58.829 --> 03:00.269
All right, boys, just remember,

03:00.405 --> 03:02.330
no matter what you do,
follow my lead.

03:02.466 --> 03:05.472
Or maybe let's just go out
there and have fun together.

03:05.607 --> 03:08.205
It's just so much pressure.

03:08.340 --> 03:09.642
Ten seconds!

03:09.777 --> 03:11.881
A-And what happens
if we can't hit it?

03:12.017 --> 03:13.416
Oh, that's not an option.

03:13.551 --> 03:14.576
If we can't hit
the perfect family harmony,

03:14.711 --> 03:16.078
we aren't perfect.

03:16.213 --> 03:18.047
And if we aren't perfect,
we're nothing.

03:18.182 --> 03:20.686
Just follow my lead,
and the harmony will happen.

03:20.821 --> 03:22.919
- Let's bro!

03:23.054 --> 03:25.894
Ladies and gentlemen,
here they are.

03:26.029 --> 03:27.792
The heartthrob.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.895
The fun boy.

03:32.596 --> 03:34.535
The sensitive one.

03:35.136 --> 03:36.768
The leader.

03:37.568 --> 03:38.836
And the baby.

Gotcha there.
Whoa!

04:57.222 --> 04:59.884
Ow.

05:05.727 --> 05:07.188
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stand by.

05:07.324 --> 05:11.200
Uh, we're experiencing,
uh, some stuff.

05:11.335 --> 05:13.565
Hey. At least we didn't fall.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.231
- Whoa!

05:15.367 --> 05:16.770
We fell.

05:16.905 --> 05:18.835
See what happens
when you don't follow my lead?

05:18.971 --> 05:20.702
Dude, that is
exactly what happens

05:20.837 --> 05:22.404
when we follow your lead.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.646
Oh, so it's my fault?
Is that what you're saying?

05:24.781 --> 05:27.676
I know we can reach
the perfect family harmony.

05:27.812 --> 05:29.481
What if we don't want to?

05:29.616 --> 05:31.486
Yeah, dude. This used to be fun.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.622
Now it's all about
being perfect.

05:33.757 --> 05:35.558
You know what?
I'm done playing the heartthrob.

05:35.693 --> 05:38.823
My exquisitely chiseled
rock-hard abs and I quit.

05:38.958 --> 05:40.955
I quit, too,
and you can keep these.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.659
I'm more than just the fun one.

05:42.794 --> 05:44.597
I'm in a sad book club.

05:44.732 --> 05:46.767
Did you know that?
A sad book club.

05:46.902 --> 05:49.104
I'm gonna find trolls
who take me seriously.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.504
Fine. I don't need this.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.408
I'm out. I'm done. I'm sorry.

05:52.544 --> 05:55.142
I'm gonna go hike
the Neverglade Trail

05:55.278 --> 05:56.707
by myself, bro-lone.

05:56.842 --> 05:58.277
Yeah, that's right.

05:58.413 --> 06:00.079
Bro-bro going solo.

06:00.214 --> 06:01.279
YOLO.

06:01.414 --> 06:02.578
Goodbye forever.

06:04.350 --> 06:05.584
- Fine. I'm out of here.
Later, losers.

06:05.719 --> 06:07.283
- Same here.
- Guys, please.

06:07.419 --> 06:08.417
Come on.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.158
It's my fault.

06:11.294 --> 06:12.693
I ruined everything.

06:12.828 --> 06:15.396
No, no, Branch,
this is not your fault.

06:15.531 --> 06:16.760
We're not in sync.

06:16.895 --> 06:18.360
We've gone from boys to men,

06:18.495 --> 06:20.463
and now there's only
one direction for us to go:

06:20.598 --> 06:21.696
the backstreets.

06:21.832 --> 06:23.237
But not you, Floyd.

06:23.373 --> 06:25.472
You're not leaving, too.

06:25.607 --> 06:27.239
Not forever. I'll be back.

06:27.374 --> 06:28.709
I promise.

06:28.845 --> 06:31.342
But right now I...
I have to follow my heart.

06:31.477 --> 06:34.347
It's telling me that it's time
to start a solo career.

06:34.483 --> 06:36.784
But what am I gonna do?

06:36.919 --> 06:41.056
Branch, you are gonna do
the most important thing of all.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.751
You're gonna...

06:42.886 --> 06:44.653
take care of Grandma.

06:44.789 --> 06:46.689
Oh, come on, Branch.

06:46.825 --> 06:48.328
Let's play some rummy.

06:48.464 --> 06:49.996
But I won't let you win,

06:50.131 --> 06:52.564
- because I play for the money.

06:52.700 --> 06:55.168
You might have to let her win.

06:55.304 --> 06:56.605
Occasionally.

06:57.971 --> 07:01.577
When you miss me,
you can wear this.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.405
It'll be like
I'm right here with you.

07:03.540 --> 07:07.081
And when you come back,
we'll make our hideout.

07:07.216 --> 07:09.180
Definitely.

07:10.016 --> 07:12.148
Wow.
Is that a ten-story waterslide?

07:12.283 --> 07:13.983
Yeah. That's how we shower.

07:14.119 --> 07:17.626
Well, we better keep this
in a safe place.

07:25.503 --> 07:27.464
I'll see you soon, Baby Branch.

07:38.180 --> 07:40.147

You're smiling and crying
at the same time.

08:10.310 --> 08:11.609
It kind of looks like
it's hurting your face.

08:11.744 --> 08:12.976
It does hurt my face.

08:13.111 --> 08:15.084
I guess I'm just
missing my, um...

08:15.220 --> 08:16.411
grandma.

08:16.546 --> 08:19.285
I was just listening
to some of her old records.

08:19.420 --> 08:20.782
BroZone? No way.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.122
I love BroZone.

08:22.258 --> 08:23.318

Really?

08:25.026 --> 08:25.653
I didn't know
you liked them, too.

08:25.789 --> 08:26.791
I don't.

08:26.926 --> 08:27.789
I'm actually hate-listening.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.091
It's a new thing.

08:29.227 --> 08:31.195
My grandma had
very questionable taste.

08:31.331 --> 08:33.063
I mean, just look at
how she decorated this place.

08:33.198 --> 08:34.736
I'm sorry,
but there are some things

08:34.872 --> 08:36.705
that just shouldn't be macraméd.
Am I right?

08:38.870 --> 08:40.203
Uh, kind of seems like

08:40.339 --> 08:41.944
there's something
you're not telling me.

08:42.079 --> 08:42.739
What?

08:42.874 --> 08:44.074
Be silly. No.

08:44.209 --> 08:46.915
Hey, I need you
to be real with me.

08:47.050 --> 08:50.084
It seems like more than
a macramé issue.

08:50.220 --> 08:54.519
If you're having feelings,
you can talk about them with me.

08:54.654 --> 08:56.257
Okay.

08:56.392 --> 08:58.221
You're right.

09:02.261 --> 09:03.832
Oh, hey. Look at the time.

09:03.967 --> 09:05.094
We're gonna be late
to the royal wedding.

09:05.230 --> 09:06.935
- Let's go get married.
- Branch.

09:07.071 --> 09:10.939
What? I-I mean, let's get
Bridget and Gristle married.

09:11.075 --> 09:13.972
Yeah. Oh, 'cause it would
be weird if we got married.

09:14.107 --> 09:15.641
-  Yeah. So weird.
- Wow.

09:15.776 --> 09:17.075
- The weirdest.
- Duh.

09:17.210 --> 09:18.280
It's, like, weird
that we're still talking

09:18.416 --> 09:19.648
about how weird it was.

09:19.784 --> 09:20.711
- Yeah.
- It's like 15 seconds later.

09:20.847 --> 09:21.879

- Blech.

Thank you so much
for being my maid of honor.

12:29.336 --> 12:31.539
I couldn't have done this
without you.

12:31.675 --> 12:32.905
Oh, of course, Bridget.

12:33.041 --> 12:35.211
I love you like a sister, probably.

12:35.346 --> 12:37.277
I don't have a sister, so
I wouldn't know, which is fine.

12:37.412 --> 12:39.041

Ah! Yeah, no, of course.

You go get him, girl,
before I do.

12:55.229 --> 12:57.794
Like a beautiful angel
sent from heaven.

13:15.383 --> 13:18.587
Hey, Bridget, you still
have time to run for it.

13:18.722 --> 13:20.448
Very funny, Aunt Smead.

13:20.584 --> 13:22.386
I'm, uh, so glad
you could make it.

13:22.521 --> 13:26.226
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

13:26.361 --> 13:30.695
to celebrate the sweet,
sweet love of Bridget--

13:30.830 --> 13:32.132
hey, girl--

13:32.267 --> 13:35.703
and Mr. Yummy-Tummy himself,
King Gristle.

13:35.839 --> 13:38.232
Now, falling in love is easy.

13:38.368 --> 13:39.734
We've all done it.

13:39.869 --> 13:41.672
I've done it a hundred times.

13:41.808 --> 13:45.576
Thousands, even, if you count
that semester I spent abroad.

13:45.711 --> 13:49.919
Stop the wedding!

13:51.021 --> 13:53.318
Uh, Bridget,
do you know this guy?

13:53.453 --> 13:56.521
I can't remember
all my suitors, Grissy.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.465
Sorry. Is this bad timing?

14:07.600 --> 14:09.801
-I'm just trying
to find a troll named...

14:09.936 --> 14:12.268
Whoo! Baby Branch!

14:12.403 --> 14:13.809
Uh, you're making a mistake,

14:13.945 --> 14:15.908
stranger that looks
similar to me.

14:16.043 --> 14:17.074
There's no Branch here.

14:17.209 --> 14:18.978
Look at you. You got so big.

14:19.113 --> 14:20.648
You're not a branch anymore.

14:20.784 --> 14:22.113
You're more like a trunk.

14:22.248 --> 14:23.512
- Junk in the trunk.
- Ow.

14:23.648 --> 14:25.614
I bet you
I can still pick you up.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.918
- Come on. Ooh, you got heavy.

14:28.054 --> 14:29.183
Aah! There goes my back.

14:29.318 --> 14:30.722
Oh, charley horse.

14:30.858 --> 14:32.024
Oh, God. Aah!

14:32.159 --> 14:33.424
- Two charley horses.
- Hey!

14:33.559 --> 14:34.996
Stop right there.
You put my boyfriend down.

14:35.132 --> 14:36.457
Tell us who you are
and what you want.

14:36.592 --> 14:38.094
-  Ow.
- Hey.

14:38.230 --> 14:39.462
What up?

14:39.598 --> 14:41.034
You're right.
Totally rude of me.

14:41.169 --> 14:42.699
Didn't introduce myself.

14:42.835 --> 14:44.768
- I'm Branch's brother.

14:44.903 --> 14:45.869
What?

14:48.010 --> 14:50.104
Ooh, drama! Corn me, Dinkles.

14:52.544 --> 14:54.548
used to be my brother.

14:54.683 --> 14:55.849
Not anymore.

14:55.984 --> 14:57.482
Hey, um, r-remember earlier

14:57.617 --> 15:00.053
when I said you should
open up to me and be real?

15:00.188 --> 15:01.385
- Well...
- You could've started

15:01.520 --> 15:03.091
by telling me
you had a secret brother!

15:03.226 --> 15:05.661
- Former brother.
- That's not how DNA works!

15:05.797 --> 15:07.295
Dad, did you know about this?

15:07.431 --> 15:10.699
What would I know
about secret family members?

15:13.103 --> 15:14.666
Oh, my gosh.
I was being so rude.

15:14.801 --> 15:16.234
I've never met anyone
from Branch's family before.

15:16.370 --> 15:17.699
I'm Poppy, Branch's girlfriend.

15:17.835 --> 15:19.501
Should we hug, fist-bump,
smile and wave for now

15:19.637 --> 15:21.242
and see where
the night takes us?

15:21.377 --> 15:23.009
- All of the above.
- Wait, I know you.

15:23.144 --> 15:25.044
You're the guy from BroZone!

15:25.179 --> 15:27.047
We were just listening to them.

15:27.182 --> 15:28.644
- Yeah, BroZone!
Oh, wait.

15:28.779 --> 15:30.350
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't tell me.

15:30.485 --> 15:31.545
Um, okay, well,
you're not the heartthrob.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.220
Well, that's your opinion. I...

15:33.356 --> 15:34.289
The fun one?
No, you're kind of uptight.

15:34.425 --> 15:35.385
Uptight?

15:35.521 --> 15:37.091
Mm, not the sensitive one, either.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.287
Okay, a lot of assumptions
for someone

15:38.422 --> 15:39.721
you just met 30 seconds ago.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.456
Oh, oh! I've got it.
You're John Dory.

15:41.591 --> 15:43.530
- The leader.
- The old one.

15:44.961 --> 15:46.497
Uh, sorry to interrupt,
but we lose the venue

15:46.633 --> 15:48.470
- at 11:00, so...
- Shh. I'm trying to listen.

15:48.605 --> 15:49.597
Very hot gossip.

15:49.732 --> 15:52.273
So, if-if you're Branch's bro,

15:52.408 --> 15:55.106
then that means that
all the other BroZone bros

15:55.241 --> 15:57.478
are Branch's bros, too.

15:58.642 --> 16:00.308
Branch, how come
you never told me?

16:00.444 --> 16:01.910
Because it's complicated.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.614
Oh, sweetie.
'Cause you weren't in the band.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.916
Branch was
in the band all right.

16:07.051 --> 16:08.019
What?

16:08.154 --> 16:09.217
No way. Which one was he?

16:09.353 --> 16:10.885
- Bitty B.
- Bitty B?

16:11.020 --> 16:13.561
No, that's impossible.
Bitty B had glasses.

16:13.697 --> 16:14.695
Oh, and a diaper.

16:14.830 --> 16:16.730
♪ And... ♪

16:16.866 --> 16:18.601

16:18.736 --> 16:19.934

16:20.069 --> 16:21.299
But that's all in the past.

16:21.435 --> 16:22.864
Because they stopped
being my brothers

16:23.000 --> 16:25.140
the day they walked out on me
and never came back.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not fair, Branch.

16:27.276 --> 16:29.044
I did come back,
but no one was there.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.045
It-it wasn't until
I heard about you

16:31.181 --> 16:32.543
saving the world
from the rock apocalypse

16:32.678 --> 16:34.576
that I realized
you were even still alive.

16:34.711 --> 16:36.312
Oh, that's-that's so sweet.

16:36.448 --> 16:37.678
He realized I was still alive.

16:37.814 --> 16:39.615
- 20 years too late!
- Hi. Sorry.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.622
He gets hangry
if he skips breakfast.

16:41.757 --> 16:42.850
I had breakfast.

16:42.985 --> 16:45.058
It was avocado toast
with two poached eggs,

16:45.193 --> 16:46.523
some cayenne for a little kick,

16:46.658 --> 16:48.592
and you know what,
it was delightful.

16:48.727 --> 16:50.131
Branch,
what's going on with you?

16:50.266 --> 16:51.766
The question
we should be asking is:

16:51.902 --> 16:53.401
What's going on with him?

16:53.537 --> 16:54.829
I bet you he's only here
because he needs something.

16:54.964 --> 16:56.802
That's not true.
He's your brother.

16:56.937 --> 16:58.966
Branch, I'm gonna be straight
with you. I need something.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.910
- And there it is.
- Come on, man. I'm trying here.

17:02.045 --> 17:03.579
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up, Branch.

17:03.714 --> 17:04.909
It's about Floyd.

17:05.045 --> 17:06.715

19:03.627 --> 19:05.026
You don't understand.

19:05.161 --> 19:07.161
Velvet and Veneer are giant,
pop-obsessed succubi

19:07.296 --> 19:08.864
with no talent,
and they've been stealing mine.

19:08.999 --> 19:10.603
And they'll be back any minute
for more.

What? That's even worse
than lip-synching.

19:13.142 --> 19:15.004
Not my brother. Not today.

19:22.218 --> 19:23.882
- John, John, stop.

The bottle is made of diamond,

19:27.557 --> 19:29.690
that's powerful enough

19:29.825 --> 19:30.819
Right.

A diamond-shattering
diamond hammer.

- No, John.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.362
to sing something
we've only tried once

20:08.498 --> 20:10.363
and failed so miserably at
that we broke up

20:10.499 --> 20:12.297
and never talked
to each other again.

20:12.432 --> 20:14.201
- We are so in!
- What?

20:14.336 --> 20:17.704
Uh, could you give us a second?

20:17.840 --> 20:18.533
Huh?

20:18.668 --> 20:20.839
Okay, what are you doing?

20:20.975 --> 20:23.277
This is your second chance
with your brothers, Branch.

20:23.413 --> 20:25.205
It's not that easy, okay?

20:25.341 --> 20:27.849
You don't get it.
You don't have any siblings.

20:27.984 --> 20:29.243
That's my point.

20:29.378 --> 20:31.682
Branch, you are so lucky
to have a brother to fight for.

20:31.817 --> 20:33.752
I mean, if I had a sister...

20:33.888 --> 20:35.690
it would be so perfect.
We'd be best friends,

20:35.826 --> 20:37.493
and we'd teach each other
things, and we'd never fight.

20:37.628 --> 20:38.821
Poppy. -And we'd always
have each other's back,

20:38.956 --> 20:40.728
and we wouldn't even
have to talk

20:40.863 --> 20:42.698
'cause we'd think
all the same thoughts. -Poppy.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.466
And everyone would ask us if
we were twins, and we'd laugh,

20:44.602 --> 20:45.161
and we'd be like,
"Well, not technically." -Poppy!

20:45.296 --> 20:46.232
But...

20:46.367 --> 20:47.699
if she were ever in trouble,

20:47.834 --> 20:50.332
I would do everything I could
to help her.

20:50.467 --> 20:51.632
I would show up.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.838
Okay, listen.

20:53.973 --> 20:56.738
If there was a brother
that I might do this for--

20:56.873 --> 20:59.144
and I'm not saying there is--

20:59.279 --> 21:00.707
it would be Floyd.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.084
I'm not hearing "no."

21:02.219 --> 21:03.911
- Yes! Works for me.
- Yeah!

21:04.047 --> 21:05.680
- BroZone 2.0. BroZone reunion.

21:05.815 --> 21:07.147
BroZone, here we bro again.

21:07.283 --> 21:08.853
- BroZone, where'd they bro?

21:08.988 --> 21:10.191
I don't know.
We're gonna find them!

21:11.359 --> 21:12.391
- Whoa!

21:12.526 --> 21:15.092
Hey, looks like our ride's here.

21:15.227 --> 21:16.462
Whoo!

21:16.598 --> 21:17.832
- Here she is.

21:21.703 --> 21:23.868
Oh, that's coming out
of the deposit.

21:24.003 --> 21:26.268
Meet Rhonda, y'all.
Ain't she a beaut?

21:29.447 --> 21:31.980
- She's, uh, really something.
- Oh.

21:32.115 --> 21:33.541
Um, I guess she likes me?

21:33.676 --> 21:35.183
Yeah, she does.

21:35.318 --> 21:37.219
Or she's marking you as prey.

21:37.355 --> 21:38.883
Can never quite tell
with Rhonda.

21:40.455 --> 21:42.719
Uh, guys, if you don't mind,

21:42.855 --> 21:45.258
I really cannot wait
another minute

21:45.393 --> 21:47.626
to marry this gorgeous specimen.

21:47.761 --> 21:50.931
I now pronounce you

21:51.067 --> 21:52.429
husband and wife.

21:56.235 --> 21:57.769
Oh!

21:59.168 --> 22:01.470
Okay, all aboard
who's going aboard.

22:01.605 --> 22:02.906
Bye, everybody!

22:03.041 --> 22:04.443
We're getting the band
back together.

22:04.578 --> 22:05.847
- Bye, Poppy.
- Bye-bye, now.

22:05.982 --> 22:06.949
Bye, Poppy.

22:07.084 --> 22:08.676
Have fun, you crazy kids.

22:08.812 --> 22:10.214
Have an awesome honeymoon!

22:10.350 --> 22:11.484
Thanks, Poppy.

22:11.620 --> 22:13.054
- I love you guys!
- Peace out, Poppy.

22:13.189 --> 22:14.548
See you later, Poppy.

22:18.726 --> 22:20.496
Today, on a very special episode

22:20.631 --> 22:22.529
of <i>The Bop on Top,</i>

I'm an open book.

22:51.593 --> 22:53.892
Wide open. We're gaping novels.

22:54.027 --> 22:56.697
Okay, well, who are
some of your biggest influences?

22:56.832 --> 23:00.465
Honestly, Vel's always been
my inspiration.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.336
My biggest inspiration? Hmm.

23:02.471 --> 23:04.571
I'd have to go with also me.

23:04.707 --> 23:06.134
Well, one thing's for sure,

23:06.270 --> 23:08.444
after two months on the scene,
the superstar duo

23:08.579 --> 23:10.646
will receive the prestigious
Lifer Award.

23:10.781 --> 23:13.009
That's celebrating
a lifetime of achievements.

23:13.144 --> 23:15.180
Be sure to catch
their performance this weekend

23:15.316 --> 23:17.077
at the Rage Dome.

23:17.213 --> 23:19.083
Last question:
How do you guys stay

23:19.218 --> 23:22.389
the biggest superstars
Mount Rageous has ever known?

23:22.525 --> 23:24.120
- What's your secret?
- Secret?

23:24.255 --> 23:25.825
We don't have a secret.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.287
Who said we have a secret?

23:27.423 --> 23:29.626
What my calm,
casual-sounding brother means

23:29.761 --> 23:31.360
is it's simple, really.

23:31.496 --> 23:36.070
It just takes lots of hard work
and loads of natural talent.

23:41.274 --> 23:43.245
If we're gonna make it
through the Rage Dome show,

23:43.380 --> 23:44.871
we're gonna need more troll.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.775
Crimp, what are you doing?

23:46.910 --> 23:48.709
Why are you always hovering?

23:48.844 --> 23:50.884
Uh, I'm standing.

23:51.020 --> 23:53.887
Well, be a good little assistant
and go stand in the corner.

23:54.023 --> 23:55.055
Oh, yes.

23:55.191 --> 23:56.491
Um, oh, dear.

23:56.626 --> 23:59.489
I think this is
kind of a c-corner.

23:59.625 --> 24:01.495
Okay, I cannot with her.

24:01.631 --> 24:03.064
- It's really too much.
- Whew.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.764
Well, time for a spritz.

24:04.899 --> 24:07.702
No, please. I barely have
any talent left to give.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.936
I mean, maybe, like,
a desperate Christmas album

24:10.072 --> 24:13.836
or a one-off national anthem
performance, but that is it.

24:13.971 --> 24:15.242
Oh, really? You don't wanna?

24:15.378 --> 24:16.644
Okay, that's fine.

24:16.779 --> 24:18.141
We'll just kiss
our careers goodbye

24:18.276 --> 24:20.277
and focus our efforts
on charity. -

24:20.412 --> 24:22.210
Good one.

24:33.188 --> 24:35.256
That's more like it.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.995
We're so close
to having everything

24:37.130 --> 24:40.262
we always knew we believed
we deserved to have.

24:40.397 --> 24:43.164
Veneer, what's with your vibe
and your face?

24:43.299 --> 24:44.903
Why do you have
resting-moody-vibe face?

24:45.038 --> 24:46.740
No, I know
we've deserved to be famous

24:46.875 --> 24:49.276
just 'cause we want to,
but honestly,

24:49.411 --> 24:50.977
that dude looks rough.

24:51.112 --> 24:53.108
He's fine.
- And he's getting pale.

24:53.243 --> 24:56.247
And not in, like,
a stunning Victorian way.

24:57.752 --> 24:59.082
Don't you see what you're doing?

24:59.218 --> 25:01.755
You're literally sucking
the life out of me.

25:01.891 --> 25:03.185
Ugh. That's what I tell Crimp
every day.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.890
What are we gonna do?

25:05.025 --> 25:06.825
We obviously can't rely
on this troll

25:06.960 --> 25:08.461
to get us through
this dress rehearsal,

25:08.597 --> 25:10.095
let alone the Rage Dome show.

25:10.231 --> 25:13.697
It's all going to change
as soon as we have BroZone.

25:13.832 --> 25:14.728
- BroZone?
Yep.

25:14.864 --> 25:16.537
I forged a letter

25:16.673 --> 25:18.833
begging for them
to come and save you.

25:18.968 --> 25:20.572
I love me.

25:20.707 --> 25:22.643
No! You leave my brothers alone.

25:22.778 --> 25:25.546
Ugh.
I'm exhausted by this drama.

25:25.681 --> 25:27.510
Hey, do you want
to go buy a yacht?

25:27.646 --> 25:28.613
Oh, good idea.

25:28.749 --> 25:31.015
Let's buy matching yachts.

25:36.122 --> 25:41.630
♪ This is for
all the lonely people ♪

25:42.932 --> 25:47.966
♪ Thinking that life
has passed us by ♪

25:49.904 --> 25:53.573
♪ We won't give up until we ♪

25:53.709 --> 25:56.744
♪ Drink from the silver cup ♪

25:56.879 --> 26:01.914
♪ And ride that highway
in the sky. ♪

26:03.346 --> 26:05.988
Your ukulele skills
are improving.

26:06.123 --> 26:07.286
Thank you.

26:10.253 --> 26:11.985
Operation Family Harmony

26:12.121 --> 26:13.923
is on and poppin'!

26:14.058 --> 26:15.456
- What?
- What? Oh, nothing.

26:15.591 --> 26:17.292
I just... Well,
if I didn't know any better,

26:17.427 --> 26:18.830
I'd-I'd almost say
you were excited.

26:18.966 --> 26:21.264
Uh, it has nothing to do
with my brothers.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.765
TINY DIAMOND
All right. All right.

26:23.901 --> 26:25.506
Tiny, Branch, Poppy

26:25.641 --> 26:27.602
- and this random dude...
- What?

26:27.738 --> 26:30.408
...on another musical adventure
filled with heart, hilarity

26:30.544 --> 26:31.676
and happiness.

26:31.812 --> 26:34.110
Tiny! What are you doing here?

26:34.245 --> 26:36.251
Well, Aunt Poppy,
for your information,

26:36.386 --> 26:37.779
I am no longer a baby.

26:37.915 --> 26:39.446
I am a big boy now.

26:39.581 --> 26:42.153
And I'm on
a man-sized rite of passage

26:42.288 --> 26:47.223
to learn lessons of life,
courage and maybe love.

26:47.823 --> 26:48.992
Aw.

26:49.128 --> 26:50.497
Uh, should we be letting
a baby drive?

26:50.633 --> 26:51.931
Not to worry, fellow grown-up.

26:52.066 --> 26:54.961
I have procured
my learner's permit.

26:55.097 --> 26:56.364
Who is Adulty McManface?

26:56.499 --> 27:00.141
The better question is:
Are you a narc?

27:00.277 --> 27:01.374
What? No. No.

27:01.510 --> 27:03.437
Why? Are you?

27:03.572 --> 27:06.278
Enough chitchat,
Adulty McManface. Step on it!

27:08.180 --> 27:09.848
<i>Okay, guys, where was I?</i>

27:09.984 --> 27:11.446
We got to find our brothers
and fast.

27:11.581 --> 27:13.984
But don't worry,
old Branch has got it handled.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.754
All we have to do
is follow the clues.

27:16.889 --> 27:19.391
Wow. Check out your old outfits.

27:19.527 --> 27:20.827
Puffy jackets?

27:20.963 --> 27:22.960
Puka shell necklaces?
Denim tuxedos?!

27:23.096 --> 27:26.333
Branch, did you have
frosted tips?

27:26.469 --> 27:27.996
Yeah. It was an era.

27:28.132 --> 27:30.104
Uh, don't forget his perm.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.165
No way.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.936
Pictures or it didn't happen.

27:33.072 --> 27:35.110
Aah! Look at you!
You were so cute.

27:35.245 --> 27:36.606
I love it.

27:38.178 --> 27:39.381
Uh, but we had to pull the plug

27:39.516 --> 27:41.175
when he tried to frost his perm.

27:41.311 --> 27:42.778
- It was an era!

27:42.913 --> 27:44.214
- Tragic.
- Whew.

27:44.349 --> 27:45.652
While you two are
strolling down memory lane,

27:45.787 --> 27:47.252
I'll work on finding Spruce.

27:47.387 --> 27:49.489
I'm gonna need copies
of that pic-- wallet size.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.091
Listen, baby brother,

27:51.226 --> 27:52.694
we don't need your little board
to find Spruce.

27:52.830 --> 27:54.692
- It's not little.
- Because I got this.

27:54.827 --> 27:56.590
Ha! Booyah.

27:56.726 --> 27:59.234
A postcard that says
"wish you were here"?

27:59.369 --> 28:00.093
That's it?

28:00.229 --> 28:01.799
It's not even signed.

28:01.934 --> 28:03.433
It's definitely Spruce.

28:03.569 --> 28:05.841
I mean, he's the only one I know
who talks that way.

28:05.976 --> 28:08.102
There's no return address.
It's blank.

28:08.237 --> 28:09.775
This could be from anywhere.

28:09.911 --> 28:11.476
We can't find Spruce with this.

28:11.612 --> 28:12.779
Yeah, we can!

28:12.915 --> 28:14.715
All we have to do
is find this sunset.

28:14.851 --> 28:16.912
Liking that optimism,
Poppy Seed.

28:17.047 --> 28:19.250
Branch, one word: keeper.

28:19.385 --> 28:22.218
Hey, man, I know about
being treated like a baby.

28:22.354 --> 28:24.359
But while it's just
the two of us,

28:24.494 --> 28:25.556
you want some of this?

28:25.692 --> 28:27.256
Nah. Thanks, man.

28:27.391 --> 28:28.823
I-I can't get back
on that train.

28:28.959 --> 28:30.327
Suit yourself.

28:30.462 --> 28:31.998
- I mean, hey, look at this.

28:32.134 --> 28:33.361
We're never gonna find Spruce
with this.

28:33.497 --> 28:36.571
I bet this sunset
doesn't even exist.

28:36.706 --> 28:38.600
Oh, hot dog!

28:38.736 --> 28:40.142
Ah, man.

28:40.277 --> 28:41.601
Of course.

28:41.737 --> 28:43.843
Hey, guys.
You're gonna want to see this.

28:43.979 --> 28:45.645
- I knew we'd find it.

28:45.781 --> 28:47.448
Spruce must be on that island.

28:47.584 --> 28:48.910
Whoa! Easy there, goggles.

28:49.045 --> 28:50.046
All right, y'all.

28:50.181 --> 28:51.045
- Let's mobilize.
- Yeah!

28:51.181 --> 28:53.019
Pedal to the metal, JD.

28:56.152 --> 28:57.252
What are you doing?

28:57.387 --> 28:58.860
Worry not, friends.

28:58.995 --> 29:00.455
Rhonda here's
completely waterproof.

29:19.511 --> 29:22.615
Oh, Grissy, this is
the most romantic honeymoon

29:22.750 --> 29:24.812
I've ever been on.

29:24.947 --> 29:26.116
Ever.

29:26.252 --> 29:28.184
Whoo!
It is a night of surprises.

29:28.320 --> 29:30.925
- Whoa!

29:32.462 --> 29:34.293
To the water park!

29:34.429 --> 29:36.095
Woo-hoo!

29:44.033 --> 29:45.606
Good old Rhonda.

29:45.741 --> 29:48.403
Completely waterproof, huh?

29:48.539 --> 29:50.040
So, um, John Dory,
who wrote that song

29:50.175 --> 29:51.413
"Girl, I Love Your Love, Girl"?

29:51.548 --> 29:52.739
- I did.
- Cool.

29:52.874 --> 29:53.943
Who wrote, um, "Girl,
You Break My Heart, Girl"?

29:54.078 --> 29:55.542
- I did.
- So cool.

29:55.677 --> 29:57.149
Who wrote
"Girl, I Love Your Love, Girl,

29:57.284 --> 29:58.612
"You Break My Heart, Girl,
I Still Love You,

29:58.748 --> 29:59.917
"But I Seriously Think
We Should Have a Talk

30:00.053 --> 30:01.216
About Our Relationship, Girl"?

30:01.352 --> 30:02.649
- Oh, that was Branch.
- Shut up!

30:02.784 --> 30:04.017
That was my favorite
BroZone song, like, ever.

30:04.152 --> 30:05.324
JK. Also me.

30:06.355 --> 30:08.494
Branch has never written a song.

30:08.630 --> 30:10.031
I was a baby.

30:10.166 --> 30:11.632
What did you want me
to write about, diaper rash?

30:11.767 --> 30:14.331
Okay, take it easy, Bitty B.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.867
- Hey, what's wrong?

30:17.002 --> 30:18.168
Nothing. Super happy.

30:18.304 --> 30:20.270
This is our most fun
mission yet. Yay.

30:20.406 --> 30:23.373
Branch, do you know
how lucky you are?

30:23.508 --> 30:25.276
A brother is a friend
who can never leave you.

30:25.411 --> 30:27.082
It's the strongest bond
in the world.

30:27.217 --> 30:29.410
I would kill to have a sibling
to sing with, Branch.

30:29.546 --> 30:32.386
Yeah, well, you can have mine.

30:32.521 --> 30:34.487
Okay. Fine.

30:34.622 --> 30:36.084
Poppy, wait.

30:36.220 --> 30:38.086
Grown-up stuff.

30:38.221 --> 30:39.654
Am I right?

30:39.790 --> 30:41.458
You know, I still got
that thang, if you want it.

30:41.594 --> 30:45.098
Whoa, whoa. Don't be waving
that thing around.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.495
All right, y'all.

30:47.631 --> 30:48.998
We're getting close
to something.

30:49.133 --> 30:52.006
I can feel it.

30:52.141 --> 30:54.670
- Whoa. What do we got here?

30:54.806 --> 30:57.838
Hey, guys, looks like I found
some fellow rock climbers.

30:57.974 --> 30:58.908
Hi.

32:07.242 --> 32:08.611
Hey, Lenny.

32:08.746 --> 32:10.715
- Seaweed floats are almost out.
- Thanks, boss.

32:10.850 --> 32:12.119
Hey, yo, Spruce!

32:12.254 --> 32:13.615
- Spruce, hey!
- Specials are on the back.

32:13.751 --> 32:15.220
Don't order the clams.
Don't ask why.

32:15.356 --> 32:17.252
Fricassee squid
and one jellyfish slider.

32:17.387 --> 32:18.653
- Spruce, wait.
- Huh?

32:18.788 --> 32:20.557
Oh, no. I knew
this would happen one day.

32:20.692 --> 32:22.460
Listen, I know you recognize me
from BroZone,

32:22.595 --> 32:24.560
and I'm happy to give you
an autograph or whatever,

32:24.695 --> 32:26.331
but can you please
be discreet about it?

32:26.466 --> 32:28.834
Spruce, it's us.
It's your brothers.

32:28.970 --> 32:30.538
Whoa.

32:30.674 --> 32:31.598
- Bitty B!
- What?

32:31.734 --> 32:33.372
- Whoa.

32:33.508 --> 32:35.505
No tossing, okay?
Too big to be tossed.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.208
The last time I saw you,
you were in diapers.

32:38.343 --> 32:39.778
- Diapers. Right.

32:39.913 --> 32:40.914
Wet willy!

32:41.049 --> 32:42.582
Stop it. That's disgusting.

32:42.717 --> 32:43.847
I am a grown-up.

32:43.982 --> 32:44.980
Oh, sorry.

32:45.116 --> 32:46.517
A wet William.

32:46.652 --> 32:48.088
Hi, Spruce. I'm Poppy.
Wow, it's, like...

32:48.224 --> 32:49.723
It's so cool to meet you
or whatever.

32:49.858 --> 32:51.024
Um, this is Tiny Diamond.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.423
Hey, what's up?

32:52.558 --> 32:54.288
Killer nachos you got here,
by the way.

32:54.424 --> 32:55.956
- Yeah!
- All right.

32:56.091 --> 32:57.726
Okay, Spruce. We're here
because Floyd needs our...

32:57.862 --> 32:59.292
Actually, no one's
called me Spruce in years.

32:59.427 --> 33:00.494
I go by Bruce now.

33:00.630 --> 33:01.836
I'm sorry, did you say "Bruce"?

33:01.971 --> 33:03.402
Yeah. I wanted to put the whole

33:03.538 --> 33:06.335
"boy band" thing behind me
now that I'm a dad.

33:06.471 --> 33:08.340
Wait a minute. You're a father?

33:08.476 --> 33:10.742
Yeah. I can't wait for you
to meet everyone.

33:10.877 --> 33:12.079
Hi, honey.

33:12.214 --> 33:13.878
These are my brothers, unexpectedly.

33:14.014 --> 33:15.775
Oh. Oh! Oh, hello there.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.312
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

33:18.448 --> 33:19.780
- Hi! -Hey.
- Hello.

33:19.916 --> 33:21.886
This is my wife
and business partner Brandy.

33:22.022 --> 33:23.757
She is my soulmate.

33:23.892 --> 33:25.120
My very tall soulmate.

33:25.256 --> 33:26.426
But we make it work.

33:26.562 --> 33:28.228
How?

33:28.363 --> 33:29.824
We don't even really know
how it works.

33:29.959 --> 33:31.227
I'm kidding. I'm-I'm not.

33:31.363 --> 33:32.527
I'm... I don't know.

33:32.663 --> 33:33.834
Daddy, Daddy,
can I have a cookie?

33:33.969 --> 33:35.134
Becoming a dad was like a...

33:35.270 --> 33:36.971
like a seismic shift
in my brain.

33:37.107 --> 33:38.703
- Daddy, Bruce Jr. bit me.
- No biting.

33:38.839 --> 33:41.269
Daddy, I don't see how
any government stands a chance.

33:41.405 --> 33:42.570
You're not wrong, kid.

33:42.706 --> 33:44.109
I'm stuck
in this ketchup bottle.

33:44.244 --> 33:45.575
Okay. Gonna handle all of that.

33:45.711 --> 33:47.848
Just give Daddy
two seconds, okay? Love you.

33:47.983 --> 33:49.179
As a dad...

33:49.314 --> 33:50.683
Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, guess what!

33:50.818 --> 33:52.020
I have pink eye.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.587
- Oh, my. Pink eye.

33:53.722 --> 33:54.681
Oh, (bleep)!

33:54.817 --> 33:56.121
Look, Spruce,
got to cut to the chase.

33:56.256 --> 33:57.487
We're not here to catch up.

33:57.623 --> 33:58.826
We're here because
we need to hit

33:58.961 --> 34:00.293
the perfect family harmony.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.195
Oh, no. You're still
going on about that?

34:02.331 --> 34:03.859
Hey. Get these guys
their meals to go.

34:03.995 --> 34:05.926
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

34:06.061 --> 34:08.565
It's for Floyd.
He's being held captive.

34:08.700 --> 34:10.431
What? Well, then,
wh-what are we waiting for?

34:10.566 --> 34:11.898
We need to call the authorities.

34:12.034 --> 34:13.467
Hit the perfect family
harmony, ye...

34:13.602 --> 34:15.342
Spruce, it-it has to be us.

34:15.478 --> 34:18.476
Floyd's being held captive
in a diamond prison.

34:19.310 --> 34:20.443
Oh. Well, yeah, you need

34:20.579 --> 34:22.113
the perfect family harmony
for that.

34:22.249 --> 34:23.977
- Exactly.
- Wait. But how?

34:24.113 --> 34:26.187
We've never even come close
to pulling it off.

34:26.323 --> 34:28.689
You do remember our last show,
don't you?

34:28.824 --> 34:30.455
If we practice,

34:30.591 --> 34:32.823
I know we'll be able to nail it.
We have to.

34:32.958 --> 34:35.229
At my age?
I really don't think that...

34:35.364 --> 34:38.231
See, guys?
I told you Dad wasn't in a band.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.663
Oh, I was in a band.
I was in the band.

34:40.798 --> 34:42.969
You ask your mother
if I was in a band.

34:43.104 --> 34:46.240
Oh, he was in a band.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.209
Prove it! Prove it! Prove it!

34:49.344 --> 34:50.807
- Prove it! Prove it!
- Oh, all right.

34:50.942 --> 34:52.010
- I'll-I'll prove it.

34:52.146 --> 34:53.412
I'll prove it right now.

34:53.547 --> 34:55.409
- Yes! Bring it in, brother.

34:55.544 --> 34:57.049
Branch, get up there.

34:57.184 --> 34:58.450
Go sing with your brothers.

34:58.585 --> 35:00.321
I'll do it to save Floyd
when I have to,

35:00.456 --> 35:02.751
but I'm not doing it right now
just for funsies.

35:02.886 --> 35:04.385
Oh, yeah. Okay.
You're probably right.

35:04.521 --> 35:05.987
No, no, no, no, no, no.

35:06.122 --> 35:07.824
You're the one who...
Wait. What'd you say?

35:07.960 --> 35:10.198
No, you're afraid that singing
with your brothers again

35:10.333 --> 35:11.793
after all these years
will overwhelm you

35:11.929 --> 35:13.599
with emotions too powerful
for you to handle.

35:13.734 --> 35:15.398
I-I agree with you.
I don't think you can handle it,

35:15.534 --> 35:17.105
so I think you shouldn't do it.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.501
I think I can handle
singing a song.

35:18.637 --> 35:20.373
Prove it! Prove it!

35:20.508 --> 35:23.244
- Prove it! Prove it!
- Ugh. All right, fine.

35:23.379 --> 35:25.108

Um, Brandy, my love.

37:00.708 --> 37:02.839
So, I know we have
kind of a lot going on here,

37:02.975 --> 37:05.905

crazy if I were to...

47:29.499 --> 47:31.502
- Let me show you around.

47:31.637 --> 47:32.605
Hug time!

47:32.741 --> 47:33.768
- Uh...

47:33.903 --> 47:34.902
Yeah, no.

47:35.037 --> 47:36.372
Aw, so cute.

47:36.508 --> 47:38.237
Where'd you get
that hug time bracelet?

47:38.372 --> 47:39.778
My dad gave it to me.

47:39.913 --> 47:42.344
Okay, this is so totally random,

47:42.479 --> 47:44.682
but I used to have one
just like it.

47:44.817 --> 47:46.213
Can I see that?

47:46.348 --> 47:48.321
Wow. It fits you perfectly.

47:48.456 --> 47:49.517
Yeah.

47:55.628 --> 47:57.564
Whoa.

47:57.700 --> 47:59.129
I'm sorry.

47:59.265 --> 48:01.566
What did you say
your name was again?

48:01.702 --> 48:03.102
I'm Poppy.

48:03.999 --> 48:05.236
Poppy?

48:16.251 --> 48:18.883
Okay, um, another
totally random, weird question,

48:19.018 --> 48:22.957
but is your dad King Peppy?

48:23.791 --> 48:25.624
Uh, yeah.

48:25.759 --> 48:27.188
You're...

48:27.324 --> 48:28.655
You're-you're alive!

48:28.791 --> 48:30.997
- I'm alive.
This is unbelievable!

48:31.133 --> 48:33.164
I never thought
I'd see you again.

48:33.299 --> 48:35.962
- Again?
- Poppy, it's me, Viva.

48:36.097 --> 48:37.064
Uh...

48:37.199 --> 48:38.801
I'm your sister.

48:38.937 --> 48:40.739
My... my what?

48:40.875 --> 48:42.809
Your sister. Your hermana.

48:42.944 --> 48:44.242
- Whoa.
Hey, man.

48:44.377 --> 48:46.813
Am I the only one
without a long-lost sibling?

48:46.949 --> 48:48.178
What do you mean we're sisters?

48:48.314 --> 48:49.843
H-How could I have not
known about you?

48:49.979 --> 48:51.884
I can't believe Dad didn't
tell me I have a sister.

48:52.019 --> 48:53.648
- That is so Dad.
- So Dad.

48:53.783 --> 48:55.286
Aah! I can't...
I can't believe this.

48:55.421 --> 48:56.949
I've always dreamt
of having a sister.

48:57.085 --> 48:58.853
I was just saying this.
Wasn't I just saying this?

48:58.988 --> 49:00.355
This means we can plan
each other's birthday parties.

49:00.491 --> 49:01.820
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, and weddings.
- Yes!

49:01.956 --> 49:03.859
My best friend Bridget
just had her wedding,

49:03.995 --> 49:05.627
and it went off without a hitch
'cause I was, like, the best

49:05.763 --> 49:07.398
maid of honor. -You'd be
the best maid of honor.

49:07.534 --> 49:09.269
You and Bridget
are gonna love each other!

49:09.405 --> 49:10.430
Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna love her.
I love what you love.

49:10.565 --> 49:11.571
- Yes!

50:38.854 --> 50:40.624
So, I was thinking about
getting more into, like,

50:40.759 --> 50:43.161
reading short stories and essays
instead of full novels.

50:43.297 --> 50:45.760
- Ooh, I love that for you.
- Yeah.

50:45.895 --> 50:47.894
But, um... but just to
circle back real quick.

50:48.029 --> 50:51.301
I still have a million questions
about what happened.

50:51.437 --> 50:52.466
I used to live
at the Troll Tree.

50:52.601 --> 50:53.932
I was there when you were born.

50:54.068 --> 50:55.668
And you were so cute,
kind of like you are now,

50:55.804 --> 50:57.708
only teensier
and weensier and...

50:57.844 --> 51:00.242
Oh. Do you want to make candy
necklaces that we never finish

51:00.378 --> 51:01.977
because we eat all the candy?

51:02.112 --> 51:03.347
Obviously!

51:03.483 --> 51:05.317
But, Veev,
I'm just gonna need you

51:05.452 --> 51:07.714
to focus here
and-and tell me everything.

51:07.849 --> 51:09.919
Why am I only learning
about you now?

51:10.055 --> 51:11.356
What happened?

51:11.491 --> 51:13.558
We got accidentally separated.

51:13.693 --> 51:15.593
And I've lived here ever since.

51:15.729 --> 51:16.797
The end.

51:16.932 --> 51:18.095
Want to do candy toe rings next?

51:18.230 --> 51:20.463
Uh, accidentally separated?

51:20.598 --> 51:22.402
Viva doesn't like
to talk about it--

51:22.538 --> 51:24.502
it's too painful for her--
but she's been here

51:24.637 --> 51:26.804
ever since the night
of the great Bergen attack.

51:28.310 --> 51:29.503
Viva, are you talking
about the night

51:29.638 --> 51:31.907
the trolls escaped Bergen Town?

51:32.042 --> 51:33.308
Oh. Yeah.

51:33.443 --> 51:35.274
Yeah, I guess it was that night.

51:37.318 --> 51:39.679
Not everyone made it out
of that tree.

51:39.815 --> 51:41.549
Some of them got trapped
by Bergens.

51:41.685 --> 51:43.423
They were this close
to getting eaten,

51:43.559 --> 51:45.588
until Viva and some of the
other trolls fought them off.

51:48.128 --> 51:49.928
But by then,

51:50.064 --> 51:51.362
the tunnels had collapsed,

51:51.497 --> 51:53.298
and they were cut off
from the rest.

51:53.434 --> 51:55.995
I kept screaming,
"No troll left behind!"

51:56.130 --> 51:59.603
But when I went back in,
the tunnels had collapsed.

51:59.739 --> 52:02.672
That's when I found
Viva's hug time bracelet.

52:02.807 --> 52:05.707
Viva found this old,
abandoned Bergen golf course

52:05.842 --> 52:07.875
and transformed it
into this troll utopia.

52:08.010 --> 52:10.845
We formed this little sanctuary
of survivors.

52:10.981 --> 52:13.617
I added fire exits.
She added her heart and soul.

52:13.753 --> 52:15.818
I've thought so many times
about leaving, you know,

52:15.954 --> 52:20.427
to look for you and Dad,
but it's not safe out there.

52:20.563 --> 52:24.996
I know I should've told Poppy,
but my heart was broken.

52:25.131 --> 52:26.462
I felt like a failure,

52:26.597 --> 52:29.361
not just as a king
but as a father.

52:29.497 --> 52:30.937
I feel so guilty.

52:31.073 --> 52:32.371
What do you think I should do?

52:32.506 --> 52:35.340
I'm afraid that's
our time for today.

52:35.475 --> 52:38.212
But I just revealed
a major trauma.

52:41.215 --> 52:43.716
Okay. Obviously, this is a lot,

52:43.851 --> 52:45.914
and you should be able to open
up about this on your own time,

52:46.050 --> 52:47.954
but we'll have plenty of time
to work through this

52:48.089 --> 52:49.521
on the way to Mount Rageous.

52:49.657 --> 52:51.617
Whoa. I am not
going to Mount Rageous.

52:51.752 --> 52:53.356
And neither are you, silly.

52:53.492 --> 52:55.922
You're never gonna leave again.

52:57.999 --> 52:59.162
Wait, what was the...

52:59.297 --> 53:00.630
What was that last thing?

53:00.765 --> 53:02.836
Okay, guys,
if we're gonna save Floyd,

53:02.971 --> 53:03.969
we need to get going.

53:04.104 --> 53:05.135
I'll go get Poppy.

53:05.271 --> 53:06.603
No, no, no, wait. Hold on.

53:06.739 --> 53:08.505
There's no way
Viva's gonna let her go.

53:08.640 --> 53:10.443
What?
Wh-What are you talking about?

53:10.579 --> 53:12.644
Like I said, she's got
some stuff going on, man.

53:12.779 --> 53:16.078
If we don't want to get trapped,
we should sneak out now.

53:25.490 --> 53:28.025
Ah, hey, Viva.

53:28.160 --> 53:29.423
What's up, girl?

53:29.558 --> 53:31.024
Viva, what are you doing?

53:31.160 --> 53:33.828
You're not leaving here,
no matter what, because...

53:33.963 --> 53:35.934
because it's just not safe
out there.

53:36.070 --> 53:37.003
You're welcome.

53:37.138 --> 53:38.303
Wait, is this about the Bergens?

53:38.439 --> 53:40.336
Because they stopped
trying to eat us.

53:40.471 --> 53:41.703
That's all in the past.

53:41.839 --> 53:43.371
Yeah, right.
That's hilarious, Poppy.

53:43.507 --> 53:44.570
I'm laughing really hard.

53:44.705 --> 53:46.038
I'm serious, Viva.

53:46.174 --> 53:48.243
Bridget, my best friend
I was telling you about,

53:48.379 --> 53:49.846
she's a Bergen.

53:49.981 --> 53:51.779
Look. Bridget and I do
a million fun things together.

53:51.914 --> 53:54.220
We talk and we play games
and we sing songs

53:54.356 --> 53:56.153
and make up
these really bad dances.

53:56.289 --> 53:58.022
It's a lot like...

53:58.157 --> 54:00.252
Well, actually, it's a lot like
what you and I have been doing.

54:00.387 --> 54:02.954
The world's a lot different
than it used to be.

54:03.090 --> 54:05.695
Viva, look, I used to be
just like you.

54:05.830 --> 54:08.166
I built a bunker,
and I lived in it for years

54:08.301 --> 54:09.663
because I knew it was safe.

54:09.798 --> 54:12.632
And, sure, it-it kept me alive,

54:12.768 --> 54:16.142
and I never had to wear pants,

54:16.277 --> 54:19.979
but I was living without pants.

54:20.114 --> 54:21.144
Does that make sense?

54:21.280 --> 54:23.242
Well, I feel judged.

54:23.377 --> 54:26.217
You don't understand.
I just got my sister back.

54:26.352 --> 54:28.183
I'm not gonna lose you.

54:28.319 --> 54:30.456
For anything.

54:33.454 --> 54:34.756
Clay?

54:34.892 --> 54:37.892
I'm sorry, Viva,
but we have to leave.

54:38.028 --> 54:40.697
I don't want to lose
my brother, either.

54:43.004 --> 54:44.338
Let's move!

54:45.172 --> 54:48.067
No. No, Poppy, wait!

54:51.474 --> 54:53.908
Poppy, please!

54:54.775 --> 54:56.543
I want you to stay.

54:56.679 --> 54:58.446
Viva, I can't do that.

54:58.581 --> 55:00.046
But you can come with us.

55:00.182 --> 55:02.418
And I know you think it's risky,
and maybe it is,

55:02.553 --> 55:04.320
but it'll be worth it.

55:04.456 --> 55:06.525
Family's always worth it.

55:08.930 --> 55:11.126
No, no, no, I...

55:11.262 --> 55:12.465
I can't.

55:37.417 --> 55:39.826
Knock, knock.

55:39.961 --> 55:41.026
Almost showtime.

55:41.162 --> 55:43.161
Ugh. No sign of BroZone?

55:43.297 --> 55:45.426
No, but I have an idea.

55:45.561 --> 55:48.164
We could practice.

55:48.299 --> 55:51.968
I want to be famous,
but I'm not gonna work for it.

55:52.104 --> 55:53.331
Ew.

55:53.467 --> 55:55.371
Come on. We used to make up
little dances together

55:55.507 --> 55:56.702
all the time, remember?

55:56.837 --> 55:58.472
Hip, hip. Twist, flip.

55:58.607 --> 55:59.841
Our dances sucked.

55:59.977 --> 56:01.641
How many fans
do you think we can get

56:01.777 --> 56:03.443
making up sucky dances?

56:03.578 --> 56:05.017
Hey, hello.

56:05.153 --> 56:07.183
Hello in there. Wake up.

56:07.318 --> 56:09.022
Wakey-wakey. Oh.

56:09.158 --> 56:10.390
He's dead? Oh, man.

56:10.526 --> 56:12.122
What have we done?

56:12.258 --> 56:13.822
What do we do?

56:13.957 --> 56:15.962
You remember the goldfish
you had as a kid?

56:16.097 --> 56:17.530
You mean Sparkles?

56:19.234 --> 56:20.531
Mm-kay. Goodbye, little guy.

56:20.667 --> 56:21.863
Please hurry up and flush.

56:21.998 --> 56:23.535
Being this close to you
next to a toilet

56:23.670 --> 56:25.637
- makes me uncomfortable.

56:27.268 --> 56:29.840
Wow. I thought ghosts
just floated away.

56:29.975 --> 56:31.638
Well, don't just stand there.
Go get him!

56:31.774 --> 56:33.040
Why does it have to be me?

56:33.175 --> 56:34.714
Because Crimp's locked
in the closet.

56:34.850 --> 56:35.708
Now, go!

56:35.844 --> 56:37.717
Help! Help!

56:38.753 --> 56:40.513
- Help me, please.

56:42.022 --> 56:43.219
Help!

56:46.723 --> 56:48.989
- Gotcha.

56:49.125 --> 56:51.529
Please, Veneer,
just let me run past you.

56:51.664 --> 56:53.365
You can pretend
you never saw me.

56:53.500 --> 56:55.128
It-it'll be our little secret.

56:56.235 --> 56:57.236
I can't.

56:57.372 --> 57:00.065
I know. Velvet would kill you.

57:00.200 --> 57:02.006
But just because
she's your sister

57:02.142 --> 57:04.940
doesn't mean you should let her
treat you like garbage.

57:05.776 --> 57:07.307
- Doesn't it?
- No.

57:07.443 --> 57:10.110
Sibling or not, you deserve
to be treated with kindness

57:10.246 --> 57:12.384
and to be around people
who would never try

57:12.519 --> 57:14.385
to change the you that you are.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.186
You got him.

57:16.321 --> 57:22.288
Hey, I know I probably don't
say this enough, but good job.

57:22.423 --> 57:25.257
We really make a great team,
don't we, bro?

57:27.694 --> 57:30.302
Now, come on. We should also
probably hire a new assistant,

57:30.437 --> 57:32.371
which feels like a you job.

57:32.506 --> 57:35.505
Crimp! Hire us a new assistant!

57:35.640 --> 57:37.641
I'm on it.

58:17.015 --> 58:18.644
Spruce, I want some smolder
in those eyes.

58:18.779 --> 58:21.287
Clay, you're being too stiff.
We need some sillier robot.

58:21.422 --> 58:23.019
Bitty B, maybe a smaller diaper.

58:23.154 --> 58:24.988
If this diaper was any smaller,
I could taste it.

58:25.123 --> 58:27.019
That's why I don't wear
one of those.

58:27.154 --> 58:29.159
It's a hard fit to pull off.

58:29.295 --> 58:31.662
Really great note, John Dory.
Super helpful. Thanks. Thanks.

58:31.797 --> 58:33.461
Now I have
a creative note for you.

58:33.597 --> 58:34.696
Stop being bossy!

58:34.832 --> 58:36.261
What? I'm not being bossy.

58:36.396 --> 58:38.331
- I'm helping us be better.
- No.

58:38.466 --> 58:40.206
No, dude, you're forcing us
to be perfect,

58:40.342 --> 58:41.641
just like you always have,

58:41.776 --> 58:43.240
so we can hit
the perfect family harmony.

58:43.375 --> 58:44.777
Yeah, for Floyd.

58:44.912 --> 58:46.709
Is it, or is this all just
so you can tell people

58:46.844 --> 58:48.309
- what to do again?
- Wh-What?

58:48.444 --> 58:49.877
Guys, guys, this really isn't
helpful right now.

58:50.013 --> 58:51.377
Let's all maybe take five, huh?

58:51.512 --> 58:52.878
This isn't gonna work
if you keep on being

58:53.014 --> 58:54.220
the same old John Dory.

58:54.356 --> 58:55.616
Yeah. We've all changed.

58:55.752 --> 58:57.019
Bruce settled down,

58:57.154 --> 58:59.358
Branch is slightly taller
with zero glasses,

58:59.493 --> 59:00.591
and I'm a licensed CPA.

59:00.726 --> 59:02.560
Put some respect
on my name, fool!

59:02.695 --> 59:04.125
Well, I'm not allowed to change.

59:04.261 --> 59:06.292
I'm the oldest.
I had to be the leader.

59:06.427 --> 59:08.965
You love bossing us around.
Just admit it.

59:09.100 --> 59:10.462
Why do you think I moved
to the middle of nowhere?

59:10.597 --> 59:12.199
So I didn't have to be
in charge of anyone.

59:12.335 --> 59:14.800
Four little brothers is
a lot of responsibility.

59:14.936 --> 59:16.201
Why do you think I left?

59:16.337 --> 59:18.309
So no one would treat me
like you did.

59:18.445 --> 59:19.607
You know what, Spruce...

59:19.742 --> 59:20.706
It's Bruce!

59:20.841 --> 59:22.076
Thank you, Clay.

59:22.212 --> 59:23.849
Guys, we can't forget
about Floyd.

59:23.985 --> 59:25.245
Look, Branch is right--
we're here for Floyd.

59:25.380 --> 59:26.980
Let's just get this done,
and we can go

59:27.115 --> 59:28.384
- our separate ways.
- Fine.

59:28.519 --> 59:29.884
Wait. What?

59:30.019 --> 59:31.924
What? The mission's the mission.

59:32.060 --> 59:33.788
You didn't think
we'd all live together

59:33.923 --> 59:35.222
when this was all over, did you?

59:35.357 --> 59:38.164
Singing songs
and roasting marshmallows?

59:38.299 --> 59:39.727
Oh, I'm sorry.

59:39.862 --> 59:41.295
Is that funny to you?

59:41.431 --> 59:44.737
That I might want us
to actually be a family again?

59:46.441 --> 59:49.236
Tiny Diamond, pull over now.

59:53.175 --> 59:55.242
Don't be a baby, Branch.

59:56.076 --> 59:57.409
You're mad at him,

59:57.545 --> 59:59.819
but you guys do
the exact same thing to me.

59:59.955 --> 01:00:02.182
You all still treat me
like the baby of the family,

01:00:02.318 --> 01:00:04.721
but guess what,
I stopped being a baby

01:00:04.856 --> 01:00:06.555
the day you guys
walked out on me.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:08.294
'Cause I had to.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.729
Then Grandma got eaten,

01:00:09.864 --> 01:00:11.323
and there was no one else
to take care of me.

01:00:11.459 --> 01:00:14.965
This time,
I'm walking out on you.

01:00:20.401 --> 01:00:23.574
This is Branch's bunker.

01:00:23.709 --> 01:00:27.879
He built this for you guys.

01:00:28.878 --> 01:00:30.750
I didn't know.

01:00:32.079 --> 01:00:34.380
I guess you never asked.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.520
Wait.

01:00:37.655 --> 01:00:39.389
Grandma got eaten?

01:00:42.563 --> 01:00:44.228
Branch, wait!

01:00:44.364 --> 01:00:45.429
Branch!

01:00:45.565 --> 01:00:46.695
Where are you going?

01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:48.596
To save Floyd-- alone.

01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:51.468
I didn't need them growing up,
and I don't need them now.

01:00:51.604 --> 01:00:53.233
What-what are you doing?

01:00:53.369 --> 01:00:55.802
What do you mean?
I'm coming with you.

01:00:55.938 --> 01:00:57.370
Why bother?

01:00:57.506 --> 01:01:00.279
Aren't you gonna leave me
eventually anyway?

01:01:00.415 --> 01:01:02.375
Everyone else does.

01:01:05.921 --> 01:01:08.981
I have been by your side
from the moment we met.

01:01:09.117 --> 01:01:11.054
And you've been by mine.

01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:13.790
Let's give each other
some credit here.

01:01:13.925 --> 01:01:15.755
Right. Uh, I'm sorry.

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:16.790
Thank you.

01:01:16.926 --> 01:01:18.729
You're welcome.

01:01:18.864 --> 01:01:20.932
And I'm not going anywhere.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.763
Unless it's with you...

01:01:23.899 --> 01:01:25.633
to save Floyd.

01:01:31.007 --> 01:01:32.839
Tiny! You're coming, too?

01:01:32.975 --> 01:01:34.508
Hey, what can I say?

01:01:34.644 --> 01:01:38.482
I was moved by Branch's speech
and his sad, sad drawing.

01:01:38.617 --> 01:01:39.845
Now, let's roll!

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.829
Wow, Grissy.

01:01:49.964 --> 01:01:51.155
I've never seen anyone
get kicked out

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.899
of a water park like that.

01:01:53.034 --> 01:01:54.895
All right, for the record,
it was the waterslide

01:01:55.031 --> 01:01:56.334
that ripped off my trunks.

01:01:56.469 --> 01:01:58.171
Ooh, so hot.

01:01:59.506 --> 01:02:00.774
Wait.

01:02:00.909 --> 01:02:03.138
- Do you smell...

01:02:03.273 --> 01:02:06.945
- French fries!
-  French fries.

01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:17.382
Ew.

01:02:17.517 --> 01:02:19.390
Who goes there?

01:02:20.995 --> 01:02:23.025
Putt-putt. Putt-putt. Putt-putt.

01:02:23.161 --> 01:02:25.123
Putt-putt.
Putt-putt. Putt-putt.

01:02:25.258 --> 01:02:26.859
Are those golf balls?

01:02:26.994 --> 01:02:28.359
Putt-putt!

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:30.368
Oh, good. They're just trolls.

01:02:30.504 --> 01:02:31.538
Look how cute.

01:02:35.575 --> 01:02:36.770
What's happening?

01:02:39.977 --> 01:02:41.443
Grissy, I didn't think

01:02:41.578 --> 01:02:44.411
we'd both find ourselves
tied up on this honeymoon.

01:02:51.021 --> 01:02:52.557
All right, look.

01:02:52.692 --> 01:02:54.159
Security is really tight,

01:02:54.294 --> 01:02:55.958
so we're not gonna be able
to just walk right in.

01:02:56.094 --> 01:02:57.155
You know what that means.

01:02:57.291 --> 01:02:58.356
We're scaling the walls.

01:02:58.491 --> 01:03:00.461
We're, huh? Doing what? When?

01:03:00.596 --> 01:03:02.198
<i>We should plan
to make our ascent</i>

01:03:02.333 --> 01:03:05.102
<i>about 200 meters east
of the entrance.</i>

01:03:05.237 --> 01:03:07.198
Good thing I brought
extra gummy gloves.

01:03:07.334 --> 01:03:09.709
I'm tired. Carry me.

01:03:09.844 --> 01:03:11.174
You have to walk
on your own, Tiny.

01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:13.445
- You have to be a big boy.
- But my feet hurt.

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.114
I don't wanna!

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.678
<i>The quickest way in
will be at the roof.</i>

01:03:16.813 --> 01:03:18.013
The HVAC system.

01:03:18.148 --> 01:03:20.319
Ooh. I love how you say "HVAC."

01:03:20.454 --> 01:03:21.614
Thank you.

01:03:21.749 --> 01:03:23.319
But we'll have to
bypass the fan blade

01:03:23.454 --> 01:03:26.690
so that our "cupcakes"
don't get sliced in two.

01:03:26.825 --> 01:03:27.990
Ooh! We brought cupcakes?

01:03:28.125 --> 01:03:29.660
- Um, no.
- No. Not what I meant.

01:03:29.796 --> 01:03:31.429
It-it doesn't matter.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.404
<i>After that, we need</i>

01:03:43.539 --> 01:03:45.644
<i>to cut the power
so we can move freely</i>

01:03:45.779 --> 01:03:47.077
<i>through the interior air ducts.</i>

01:03:47.212 --> 01:03:48.607
How do you know
which wires to cut?

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:50.478
I don't.
I'm just blasting everything

01:03:50.614 --> 01:03:53.546
- until something turns off.

01:03:54.454 --> 01:03:55.248
Hello?

01:03:55.383 --> 01:03:56.614
<i>From there,</i>

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.487
<i>we'll have
to do some exploring,</i>

01:03:58.623 --> 01:04:00.019
<i>but we'll find Floyd
in one of those rooms.</i>

01:04:00.154 --> 01:04:02.423
Look. There he is.

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:08.264
Come on.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.700
Floyd.

01:04:12.836 --> 01:04:14.340
Branch?

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:15.571
Is it really you?

01:04:15.706 --> 01:04:16.739
Yeah.

01:04:16.875 --> 01:04:18.243
It's really me.

01:04:18.379 --> 01:04:19.440
Wow.

01:04:19.575 --> 01:04:21.172
You've really grown
into that vest.

01:04:21.307 --> 01:04:22.775
You're a man now.

01:04:22.911 --> 01:04:23.978
Oh!

01:04:24.114 --> 01:04:26.645
Finally, somebody gets me.

01:04:29.724 --> 01:04:31.421
But you need to leave right now.

01:04:31.556 --> 01:04:33.455
No, Floyd, it's okay.
We're here to rescue you.

01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:35.626
No, th-this is a trap.
Velvet and Veneer, they...

01:04:35.762 --> 01:04:37.062
they lured you here.

01:04:37.197 --> 01:04:38.458
You got to leave
before they come back. Hurry!

01:04:38.593 --> 01:04:41.027
No, I'm not leaving here
without you.

01:04:41.162 --> 01:04:42.429
Branch, please.

01:04:42.565 --> 01:04:43.902
- Do it for me.
We're so close.

01:04:44.038 --> 01:04:45.804
I told you BroZone
would show up.

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.634
My letter worked. I'm a genius.

01:04:47.769 --> 01:04:50.174
Are you sure
you're sure about this?

01:04:59.553 --> 01:05:01.051
Oh, no.

01:05:01.187 --> 01:05:02.615
- Ow! Ow!

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:04.689
It's biting me.
Put it in the closet!

01:05:04.824 --> 01:05:06.151
Put it in the closet!

01:05:06.287 --> 01:05:08.027
Hello.

01:05:08.961 --> 01:05:09.893
- Floyd!
- Floyd!

01:05:10.028 --> 01:05:10.959
- Hey, bro.
- Brothers.

01:05:11.095 --> 01:05:12.094
It's so good to see you.

01:05:12.229 --> 01:05:13.727
We would have been here sooner,

01:05:13.863 --> 01:05:15.434
but these guys wouldn't stop
yelling at each other.

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:16.562
Guys, please.

01:05:16.697 --> 01:05:18.202
John Dory,
you're the one who parked

01:05:18.337 --> 01:05:19.565
in the spot marked
"reserved for BroZone."

01:05:19.701 --> 01:05:21.372
Didn't that seem
a little sus to you?

01:05:21.507 --> 01:05:23.205
- Oh, so it's my fault?
-  Oh, look.

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:25.239
They're even cute
when they fight.

01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:26.705
- Boop, boop, boop.
- Ow! Stop!

01:05:26.841 --> 01:05:28.277
- Boop, boop, boop, boop.
- What are you doing?

01:05:28.413 --> 01:05:29.775
Come on, man.
You're better than this.

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:31.210
- Well, thank you.
I really don't see

if we made out?

01:07:07.775 --> 01:07:09.944

about your wedding.

01:07:10.079 --> 01:07:11.242

01:07:14.318 --> 01:07:16.019

I don't think
that's what she means.

01:07:20.957 --> 01:07:23.492
Yeah, no, that's not
what I'm talking about.

01:07:23.627 --> 01:07:25.930

gonna eat us?

01:07:26.066 --> 01:07:28.328
No, but I understand the fear.

01:07:39.039 --> 01:07:42.878
It's called
systematic desensitization.

Floyd.

Come on, man, wake up.

01:16:45.556 --> 01:16:46.753
Wake up, Floyd.

01:16:46.888 --> 01:16:48.727
We need you, brother.

01:16:50.395 --> 01:16:51.429
Oh, no.

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:54.058
I-I built the hideout, Floyd.

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:57.098
Except the ten-story waterslide.

01:17:01.339 --> 01:17:02.570
But...

01:17:02.706 --> 01:17:04.438
how will we shower?

01:17:04.573 --> 01:17:05.873
Floyd.

01:17:06.009 --> 01:17:07.674
- Floyd? Floyd!

01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:10.980
No way! Yeah!

01:17:14.751 --> 01:17:16.648
Listen up, Mount Rageons.

01:17:16.783 --> 01:17:19.189
We are...

01:17:19.325 --> 01:17:20.655
frauds!

01:17:23.392 --> 01:17:26.625
And we've been literally
torturing little trolls.

01:17:28.128 --> 01:17:30.065
We just wanted to be famous.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.068
Honestly, my sister wanted
to be famous,

01:17:32.203 --> 01:17:34.667
and truly, I was too afraid
to stand up to her.

01:17:36.373 --> 01:17:39.639
It's like I don't even know
who you are.

01:17:39.775 --> 01:17:41.106
Yeah, you do.

01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:43.042
And you asked me
to change anyway.

01:17:43.177 --> 01:17:46.114
Which isn't okay, family or not.

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:52.155
Crimp, what are you doing?

01:17:53.125 --> 01:17:54.856
I was just saying
that I had a change of heart.

01:17:54.991 --> 01:17:56.724
You also engaged
in troll-napping,

01:17:56.859 --> 01:17:58.597
troll torture, fraud.

01:17:58.732 --> 01:18:00.165
It's just...

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:01.426
And tax evasion.

01:18:01.562 --> 01:18:02.697
I'm gonna have to repossess
your yacht.

01:18:02.833 --> 01:18:05.468
Fair enough. Prison it is!

01:18:05.604 --> 01:18:07.271
Wow, this is liberating!

01:18:10.906 --> 01:18:12.408
So, how you feeling?

01:18:12.543 --> 01:18:15.543
Happy, grateful,

01:18:15.678 --> 01:18:17.278
and really sorry

01:18:17.414 --> 01:18:19.745
that it's taken me this long
to open up to you.

01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:20.945
Whoa, TMI!

01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:22.387
Boundaries, my man.

01:18:22.523 --> 01:18:23.816
That is a lot of feelings.

01:18:36.570 --> 01:18:38.431
Um, what just happened?

01:18:38.566 --> 01:18:40.398
Oh, that.
Viva just braided your hair.

01:18:40.533 --> 01:18:41.999
It means she likes you.

01:18:42.135 --> 01:18:43.535
It means I like you!

01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:45.237
We're gonna have
the best family reunion ever.

01:18:45.373 --> 01:18:47.746
And big, long talk with Dad.

01:18:47.881 --> 01:18:49.240
Ha! King of secrets, that guy.

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:50.915
Right? What is his deal?

01:18:51.051 --> 01:18:54.116
Oh, he's gonna be
so happy to see you.

01:18:55.781 --> 01:18:58.220
Hey, Viva, do you want to make
candy necklaces

01:18:58.356 --> 01:19:00.625
that we never finish
because we eat all the candy?

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.324
Great minds think alike, Daddy.

01:19:03.289 --> 01:19:05.092
Whew, looking good, Bruce.

01:19:05.228 --> 01:19:06.524
You bet. Hey, down.

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:08.961
No pulling out
Daddy's chest hair. Ow!

01:19:09.096 --> 01:19:10.361
Kids, cover your ears.

01:19:10.497 --> 01:19:12.302
You look hot.
Honey, break a leg.

01:19:12.438 --> 01:19:14.401
Branch, I'm sorry we didn't
get to see you grow up,

01:19:14.536 --> 01:19:16.903
but I'm excited to get
to hang out with you now.

01:19:17.038 --> 01:19:18.337
Yeah, same here, Clay.

01:19:18.472 --> 01:19:20.378
Hey, you want to join
my sad book club?

01:19:20.513 --> 01:19:21.638
It's really cool.

01:19:21.774 --> 01:19:23.582
We just sit around
and hug and stuff and cry.

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:25.916
Yeah, totally.

01:19:26.052 --> 01:19:27.779
BroZone! BroZone!
- What's up?

01:19:27.914 --> 01:19:29.682
- You got the preshow jitters?

01:19:29.817 --> 01:19:32.419
I can't believe that we almost
missed out on all this.

01:19:32.554 --> 01:19:34.893
We may not be the new kids
on the block anymore,

01:19:35.028 --> 01:19:37.055
but I'm loving
this new edition of us.

01:19:37.191 --> 01:19:38.523
You know, I'm really glad

01:19:38.659 --> 01:19:40.357
those 98 degrees of separation
are behind us.

01:19:40.493 --> 01:19:42.394
Just as long as we're together.

01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:45.803
Mm. Hey, you guys
got to try this menudo.

01:19:45.939 --> 01:19:48.036
Guys, are we sure
this is the place?

01:19:48.172 --> 01:19:49.870
Well, it does match
the postcard.

01:19:50.005 --> 01:19:51.438
"Wish you were here"?

01:19:51.574 --> 01:19:53.378
Branch is the only one I know
who talks like that.

01:19:53.514 --> 01:19:55.140
Oh, here we go now!

01:19:55.276 --> 01:19:57.944
That new song is sick, Branch.

01:19:58.079 --> 01:19:59.651
I knew you had it in you.

01:19:59.786 --> 01:20:01.117
Oh, yeah, thanks.

01:20:01.253 --> 01:20:02.480
It's, you know,
just a little something

01:20:02.616 --> 01:20:04.750
me and a few of my buddies
were working on.

01:20:04.885 --> 01:20:06.289
What?

01:20:07.259 --> 01:20:09.587
- Hey, here they are now.

01:20:11.825 --> 01:20:14.259
What? You didn't think
BroZone was the only band

01:20:14.394 --> 01:20:16.432
I've ever been in, did you?

01:20:16.568 --> 01:20:17.661
Please.

01:20:17.796 --> 01:20:20.504
Now, these guys know
how to flex the drip.

01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.867
You are so in sync.

01:20:23.636 --> 01:20:25.475
Did you hear what he said?

01:20:26.811 --> 01:20:28.178
I don't get it.

01:20:28.313 --> 01:20:29.807

01:20:29.943 --> 01:20:31.544

So the nachos was good.
That was a lot of fun.

01:25:03.785 --> 01:25:05.821
And then I got to drive the van.

01:25:05.957 --> 01:25:07.258
That was cool.

01:25:07.393 --> 01:25:08.921
So then we got locked
in the mini golf course,

01:25:09.057 --> 01:25:11.222
and there was a giant clown head
that started talking to us, man.

01:25:11.357 --> 01:25:12.492
Whew. Too crazy.

01:25:12.628 --> 01:25:13.924
But yeah,
I'm enjoying the journey.

01:25:14.059 --> 01:25:15.530
I'm enjoying the journey.
I'm growing.

01:25:15.665 --> 01:25:17.599
I'm developing.
I feel strong every day.

01:25:17.734 --> 01:25:20.337
But, uh, you know, I thought
I was ready to be a man,

01:25:20.472 --> 01:25:22.806
