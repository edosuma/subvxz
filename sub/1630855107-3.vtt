08:15.119 --> 08:18.164
Well, at first I was
with a bunch of friends,

08:18.956 --> 08:20.791
but we fell out, so I ditched them.

08:22.835 --> 08:27.757
And then I met new friends,
a man and his son.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.259
But I lost them.

Well, you know what Last Men do, right?
They kidnap hybrids and worse.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.279
