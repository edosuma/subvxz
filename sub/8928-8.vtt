WEBVTT

00:19.920 --> 00:21.889
There is a place
not far from here

00:21.989 --> 00:24.158
where you could be
feared and respected.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.560
Eight men
who support Hamund.
You said it yourself.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.130
We kill him,
they all become threats
to both of us.

00:29.230 --> 00:32.400
They disappear
all at once tonight.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.803
Between you and Flint,
I'm not certain who I
should be more afraid of.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.639
- Leave with me.
- I've spent my life trying
to build something here.

00:38.739 --> 00:42.110
- ( sobbing )
- What if I forgo payment
for the schedule

00:42.210 --> 00:43.744
in exchange for my share
of the prize?

00:43.844 --> 00:46.013
When the time comes for me
to reveal the last piece,

00:46.114 --> 00:47.315
I will be right
by your side.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.583
It wasn't Singleton
that stole the page.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.752
- It was him.
- You're lying to them.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.054
If no one knows,
everyone wins.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.257
I believe in this place.
If there's anyone who can do

00:56.357 --> 00:59.026
what's necessary to make it
something better, it's you.

00:59.127 --> 01:01.262
Once we have the money,
Flint dies.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.432
- No argument.
- Not from me.

01:07.101 --> 01:10.104
( theme music playing )

02:42.630 --> 02:44.632
( rattling )

02:46.133 --> 02:48.436
( music playing )

02:48.536 --> 02:50.671
( thumping, squeaking )

02:57.177 --> 02:59.280
( thunder rumbling )

03:00.681 --> 03:02.182
Ca va?

03:13.461 --> 03:16.597
Mr. Rackham,
a word.

03:16.697 --> 03:20.368
I've been expecting you,
please Sit.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.503
Won't you tell me what you
think of our little production?

03:22.603 --> 03:24.438
The theme is
"Evenings in Paris."

03:24.538 --> 03:26.006
I'll give you three
guesses whose idea it was.

03:26.106 --> 03:29.176
Mr. Rackham,
I just saw the bursar.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.745
He says I'm no longer
to receive my distribution

03:31.845 --> 03:34.047
of the house's profits.
Your instruction?

03:34.147 --> 03:36.350
Yes, I did some
rough calculations
to figure the amount

03:36.450 --> 03:39.520
you've been skimming
from the take since we first
began this arrangement.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.556
It only seems fair
to garnish your proceeds
to account for it.

03:42.656 --> 03:46.059
( laughs )
Mr. Rackham, I understand
your new friend

03:46.159 --> 03:47.995
has helped to bring
the girls into line,

03:48.095 --> 03:52.333
has them reporting
their income in a most
honest fashion.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.468
That must be
very nice for you.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.037
But let us get something
very straight.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.707
I'm not
one of the girls.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.575
I will have my cut

04:01.675 --> 04:05.012
or everyone in
this street will know
what became of Mr. Noonan.

04:06.647 --> 04:10.284
- You would do that?
- Don't you dare doubt it.

04:11.952 --> 04:15.489
Well, Mrs. Mapleton,
that sounds like gross
insubordination to me.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.825
That, coupled with the graft
you've been responsible for,

04:17.925 --> 04:20.461
leaves me with
no choice but to terminate
your employment here.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.063
- What?
- You're dismissed.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.132
Thank you
for your service.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.034
Pardon me, but have you
lost your mind?

04:27.134 --> 04:28.802
Not that
I'm aware of, no.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.572
I just told you
that I am fully willing

04:31.672 --> 04:33.841
to inform every
merchant in Nassau

04:33.941 --> 04:37.277
that you murdered your way
into ownership of this place.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.013
They will band together
to see you hanged.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.550
Which ones exactly?

04:43.951 --> 04:47.488
Which merchants will see
Mr. Rackham hanged?

04:47.588 --> 04:48.989
Mr. Connors
the wheelwright?

04:49.089 --> 04:50.824
( laughing )

04:50.924 --> 04:53.293
Or perhaps Mr. Peterson
the butcher.

04:55.496 --> 04:58.899
Maybe Mr. Rusch
the lapidary?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.735
They all have enjoyed
steep discounts here
lately.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.738
Affordable now
that the books are
in good order.

05:04.838 --> 05:08.342
I wonder,
given their fondness
for the new management,

05:08.442 --> 05:12.446
which one of them would
much care what you think
happened to Mr. Noonan?

05:12.546 --> 05:15.115
You forgot the only name
that matters, dear.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.951
The lady across the street.
She finds out about this--

05:18.051 --> 05:20.488
Oh, Madam Guthrie knows.
She's fine with it.

05:20.588 --> 05:23.791
But by all means,
go ahead, tell her again.
I can't see any harm in it.

05:27.361 --> 05:30.030
You will regret
this, sir.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.966
I'm sure I won't.
Au revoir.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.403
( thunder rumbles )

05:36.437 --> 05:37.871
( chuckles )

05:37.971 --> 05:40.674
Please don't judge me,
but I really enjoyed that.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.243
You do not believe she will
attempt to strike back at you?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.312
I wouldn't
put it past her.

05:45.413 --> 05:48.616
But at the moment
I'll live with the potential
for future trouble

05:48.716 --> 05:51.351
over the certainty of actual
trouble she was causing.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.821
To a profitable
venture.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.757
And a partner significantly
more pleasing to the eye.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.461
( wind whistling )

06:08.536 --> 06:10.704
( crewmen yelling )

06:20.180 --> 06:22.483
( music playing )

06:22.583 --> 06:25.252
( men chatting )

06:25.352 --> 06:27.154
What am I supposed
to do with this?

06:27.254 --> 06:30.824
If he's to continue
on the ship, the crutch
is too much of an impediment.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.427
He shall have to wear this
whether he likes it or not.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.663
Come on, Randall.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.732
Dr. Howell made this
'specially for you.

06:38.832 --> 06:41.334
Help you
move around better.

06:41.435 --> 06:44.705
Perhaps you'll even be able
to visit the shitter once in
a while without needing my help.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.010
Whoa, easy there.

06:54.448 --> 06:56.283
You're responsible
for him.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.118
You figure it out.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.492
"Oh, Mr. Silver.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.027
How can I ever thank you?

07:07.127 --> 07:10.330
First you save me
from ending up as a stain
on the Walrus's underside.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.566
Then you secured
my position on the crew

07:12.666 --> 07:14.234
on the verge
of an historic haul.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.169
And if that
weren't enough,

07:16.269 --> 07:18.639
you're still
trying to find
something comfortable

07:18.739 --> 07:20.073
to put at the end
of my stump.

07:20.173 --> 07:23.811
From the bottom
of my heart, thank you."

07:27.347 --> 07:29.182
You're welcome.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.219
( thumps )

07:36.056 --> 07:37.991
( thunder crackles )

07:40.193 --> 07:41.829
Launch from the Ranger.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.964
Captain Gates
is coming over.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.233
Crazy bastard.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.735
What could be
so fucking important

07:47.835 --> 07:50.237
that he has to row
through all that shit
out there?

07:55.342 --> 07:57.545
( thunder crackles )

08:13.326 --> 08:15.262
( grunting )

08:30.310 --> 08:33.280
We make landfall
in the morning.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.585
The last part
of the schedule
if you don't mind.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.695
What's that?

08:47.795 --> 08:49.897
My own reconnaissance.

08:49.997 --> 08:53.601
There are a dozen bays
and inlets within a day's
journey from here

08:53.701 --> 08:56.069
that will make reasonable
locations for the Urca
to take on water.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.939
If the course
you write down
leads to one of them,

08:59.039 --> 09:01.241
odds are that your
information is accurate.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.343
And if it doesn't?

09:03.443 --> 09:05.713
( thunder crackles )

09:38.411 --> 09:40.814
Division Bay.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.183
The course leads
to Division Bay.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.387
Shoals on
the eastern shore,

09:47.487 --> 09:49.089
but if we approach
from the windward,

09:49.189 --> 09:51.291
we should be able to take up
a strong opening position.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.528
Take this
to Mr. De Groot.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.297
Tell him to adjust
our course accordingly

09:57.397 --> 09:59.667
and set up our final
approach for the morning.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.004
Something else?

10:05.472 --> 10:08.475
Well, now that I've fulfilled
my end of the bargain,

10:08.575 --> 10:11.311
I'm just wondering
where you and I stand.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.647
Keep wondering.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.529
I best be getting back.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.264
Let's not tempt fate.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.871
Talbot Rhodes.
Private stock.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.141
I've been waiting
for an occasion.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.814
My reckoning is
tomorrow

10:46.914 --> 10:49.416
we'll either
be able to afford
a lot more of it or--

10:49.516 --> 10:51.752
We'll be too dead
to care.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.428
( clucking )

11:01.528 --> 11:04.164
( music continues )

11:04.264 --> 11:06.266
( retching )

11:19.379 --> 11:21.281
( knocking )

11:31.291 --> 11:33.526
Captain asked me
to pass these to you.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.763
A new course.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.069
The captain accepted
the last segment of the Urca
route as valid?

11:42.169 --> 11:43.837
One thing you
should not doubt.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.306
Certainty is not a word
I throw around lightly.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.176
Now this information,
I am quite certain
I have it right.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.816
( door opens, closes )

11:58.018 --> 12:00.253
That man has a strange
way of handling

12:00.353 --> 12:02.389
the prospect of imminent
wealth beyond reason.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.867
Ma'am.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.970
What are you
doing here?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.272
Captain Hornigold
asked me to sit in

12:19.372 --> 12:22.475
on Captain Lawrence's final
preparations before departure.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.477
They're just finishing
upstairs.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.479
Mm.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.283
I'm fine.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.952
Believe it or not,
this place didn't collapse

12:32.052 --> 12:33.320
the moment you walked
out the door.

12:33.420 --> 12:37.190
You really believe my concern
is for this place?

12:41.194 --> 12:42.996
It's a ship killer
out there.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.066
I can't even imagine
what it's like
further north.

12:46.166 --> 12:49.236
You'd been opposed to hunting
the Urca from the beginning.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.806
Perhaps God's on your side
of this one.

12:55.675 --> 12:58.611
I just think of
all the trouble that
fucking schedule caused.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.647
The trouble
it caused Max and I.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.115
Caused you and I.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.952
The thought that it could all
end up being for nothing--

13:05.052 --> 13:08.555
Perhaps the trouble
was going to happen anyway.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.657
Schedule or no.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.860
Perhaps.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.896
Tomorrow a thing
that you conceived

13:15.996 --> 13:17.664
out of thin air
becomes real.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.967
A thing that will
give this place

13:20.067 --> 13:22.903
a chance to find some
small measure of peace.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.839
That is not nothing.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.044
( thunder rumbles )

13:33.246 --> 13:34.547
Henderson?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.016
It wasn't Henderson.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.852
It was something
like Henderson.
Harrison? Harvey?

13:38.952 --> 13:40.253
I don't know who the fuck
you're talking about.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.890
The man that nicked
that bottle was called Cregg.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.925
Cregg! That's him.
Cregg.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.195
Mr. Cregg.
Carpenter's mate.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.164
Had a nose
for sniffing out booze

13:51.264 --> 13:53.133
on a prize ship
like a fucking bloodhound.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.803
Oh, Cregg.
I remember walking in
on him once,

13:56.904 --> 13:59.472
digging through a stash
on a prize.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.242
( laughs )
He--

14:02.342 --> 14:04.878
he found
this bottle of booze
behind a baseboard.

14:04.978 --> 14:08.982
Now he's convinced that
the prize captain's been
hiding his best liquor.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.886
So he pops the cork
and takes this big swig

14:12.986 --> 14:14.221
in front of all of us.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.990
- And it was piss.
- It was piss.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.093
( both laughing )

14:21.728 --> 14:23.796
Aye, Cregg.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.398
- Oh, God.
- Flint: Oh, Cregg.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.267
I brought him over
with me, you know.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.536
We served together under
Avery when we was kids.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.105
Huh.
He was my first bunkmate.

14:32.205 --> 14:35.808
For years he went on
how he'd got this

14:35.909 --> 14:39.980
huge stash hidden away.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.848
And I should live
to survive him

14:41.949 --> 14:44.284
because one day
I will be a rich man.

14:44.384 --> 14:48.956
As you know, we lost
him on the Pembroke.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.126
So I open his locker
and what do I find?

14:54.661 --> 14:57.564
12 pesos,
a busted pocket watch,

14:57.664 --> 14:59.899
and a letter
with instructions

15:00.000 --> 15:01.668
to deliver it
to his sister in New York.

15:01.768 --> 15:04.737
Lying sack of shit

15:04.837 --> 15:07.074
was Mr. Cregg.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.478
So I bought the boys
a round with the pesos,

15:11.578 --> 15:13.580
traded the pocket watch
for a bit of tail,

15:13.680 --> 15:16.583
and spent two weeks
that winter in New York

15:16.683 --> 15:19.987
trying to deliver that fucking
letter to his sister.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.289
Looked high and low.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.724
Never found her.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.294
So on the way home,

15:27.394 --> 15:29.096
I waited till we were
in open water

15:29.196 --> 15:30.630
and I could see no land
in any direction,

15:30.730 --> 15:33.100
and I dropped it
over the side.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.569
Returned to the sea.

15:42.642 --> 15:46.613
There are no legacies
in this life, are there?

15:48.982 --> 15:52.052
No monuments.
No history.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.456
Just the water.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.461
It pays us

16:01.561 --> 16:03.696
and then it claims us.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.067
Swallows us whole.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.139
As if we'd never
been here at all.

16:19.912 --> 16:21.814
Well...

16:21.914 --> 16:23.650
I better be
getting back.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.230
( door creaks, closes )

16:41.168 --> 16:43.436
( children talking )

16:46.739 --> 16:48.041
( men grunting )

16:55.715 --> 16:58.485
How the fuck can you
cut Mapleton loose without
even telling me?

16:58.585 --> 17:00.753
I'm sorry.
I wasn't aware you were her
attorney in this matter.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.490
She'll run her mouth
all over the fucking
island about Noonan.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.326
Who cares? The only people
who could conceivably
make trouble for us

17:06.425 --> 17:09.028
are currently elbow deep
in free prostitute downstairs.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.330
What's worse, you keep counsel
with a whore about it.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.165
Wait, what?

17:13.266 --> 17:15.001
You think you can
trust her, you dumb shit?

17:15.102 --> 17:16.703
That's what this
is about? Max?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.405
You fucked her,
didn't you?

17:18.505 --> 17:20.240
Jesus H. Christ.
I can't win with you.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.642
She's in the camp
with the men and it's,
"Come on, Jack,

17:22.742 --> 17:24.877
let's go kill everybody
and see if we can't get
her out of there.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.546
Hope you don't mind.
Made that decision
on your behalf."

17:26.646 --> 17:28.881
And now she's out, making us
a small fortune, by the way,

17:28.981 --> 17:30.483
and you're pissed off
about that, too.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.019
Might you consider
making up your fucking
mind about it, please?

17:33.120 --> 17:34.587
- Fuck you, Jack.
- "Fuck you, Jack."

17:34.687 --> 17:36.489
Yes, I know.
Fuck me.

17:40.593 --> 17:41.594
( door slams )

19:09.081 --> 19:11.451
Listen here!

19:14.687 --> 19:17.890
When we crest the point ahead
and spot the Urca in anchor,

19:17.990 --> 19:20.126
we'll begin
our final run at her.

19:20.227 --> 19:23.062
- Take it.
- The Spanish banner may
earn us a few hundred yards

19:23.162 --> 19:26.366
of confusion
before the captain
identifies us and opens fire.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.868
So we'll close fast
on her,

19:28.968 --> 19:30.703
hammer her well
with our guns,

19:30.803 --> 19:33.306
and then take the fight
to her decks.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.942
That fight will be the fight
of our lives,

19:36.042 --> 19:38.311
make no mistake.

19:38.411 --> 19:41.548
But on the other side

19:41.648 --> 19:43.182
lies paradise.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.419
( cheering )

19:46.519 --> 19:48.988
I'll see you there.
Mr. De Groot?

19:49.088 --> 19:51.224
A full complement,
if you please.

19:51.324 --> 19:53.760
- ( whistles )
- Signal the Ranger.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.529
- Aye, captain.
- Full sail,
final approach.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.901
Check our position.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.736
- This is the course.
- Well, check it again.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.871
Captain, this is
the location you requested.

21:08.501 --> 21:12.271
Your true manifest.
Your false manifest.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.774
And, most importantly,
your bribe money.

21:14.874 --> 21:15.975
Godspeed, Captain.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.511
Perhaps we should go over
the details one more time.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.080
The harbormaster's
name is Singer.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.715
The foreman's
name is Smith.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.451
The warehouse
manager's Clay,

21:24.551 --> 21:25.752
and the customs man
is Kent.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.287
Now if you don't let me
board my ship

21:28.388 --> 21:29.822
and leave this place,
none of it will matter

21:29.922 --> 21:33.225
as the goods
in my hold will be rotten
by the time I arrive.

21:33.326 --> 21:35.528
- Goodbye.
- Godspeed.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.002
I have to
hand it to you,

21:43.102 --> 21:45.104
you said you'd rebuild things
here without your father,

21:45.204 --> 21:47.273
and damned if you
didn't do just that.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.776
Still one step
yet to accomplish.

21:51.744 --> 21:54.013
Removing my father
entirely.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.415
Excuse me?

21:55.515 --> 21:57.283
I know he's out
in the Underhill estate.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.151
If you think he isn't scheming
to undo everything

21:59.251 --> 22:00.520
we've done here,
you're kidding yourself.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.755
You are truly
amazing.

22:02.855 --> 22:05.758
In a moment when stability
is at hand and the world
is at your feet,

22:05.858 --> 22:08.495
your first instinct
is to go out in search
of someone new to fight.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.630
Captain, a moment.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.031
God.

22:13.766 --> 22:15.668
Can't believe you left me
for that old lady.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.370
Captain Hornigold
is right.

22:17.470 --> 22:20.306
( cannon fire blasts )

22:20.407 --> 22:21.941
What the fuck?

22:23.776 --> 22:26.579
- Where did that come from?
- ( cannon fire rumbles )

22:30.983 --> 22:33.753
Jesus Christ, Ben,
why are your men firing
on their own ship?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.622
My men aren't the ones
doing the firing.

22:35.722 --> 22:39.125
( cannon fire continues )

22:39.225 --> 22:40.727
We need to get you
off the beach now.

22:50.336 --> 22:52.371
Is someone shooting
the guns off out here?

22:52.472 --> 22:53.740
What the hell
is going on?

22:53.840 --> 22:56.342
Someone has taken over
the fort.

22:56.443 --> 22:58.678
( cannon fire continues )

23:09.021 --> 23:12.625
Captain, after an
inventory of our stores,

23:12.725 --> 23:14.561
the men have assented
to your plan.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.229
Provided we find a suitable
place to land the Walrus,

23:17.329 --> 23:19.065
you'll have two days
to send out scouts

23:19.165 --> 23:20.867
and hopefully
locate the Urca.

23:20.967 --> 23:24.070
Given their mood,
I'd say we were lucky
to get that long.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.640
Do it, then.

23:31.544 --> 23:34.280
- What?
- It's Mr. De Groot.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.583
He's put his foot down.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.985
Once we make landfall,
he wants Flint tried
immediately.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.887
Oh, Jesus.

23:40.987 --> 23:43.355
He's bitter about the fact
that we didn't listen to him
regarding the cook.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.757
He says there's
no Urca out here

23:44.857 --> 23:46.693
and that justice has been
delayed long enough.

23:46.793 --> 23:49.261
That's not gonna happen,
so let's discuss reality.

23:49.361 --> 23:51.464
He said that
you'd say that.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.966
And after all your talk,
you're just protecting Flint.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.335
I'm protecting all of us.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.204
These men are right
on the edge

23:58.304 --> 23:59.572
and he wants to rile
them up more

23:59.672 --> 24:01.741
by talking about a lying,
thieving captain,

24:01.841 --> 24:04.944
then stand on a deserted beach
and talk about an election.

24:05.044 --> 24:08.080
Before you know it,
half a dozen men will have
laid claim to the captaincy.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.816
Camps will divide.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.151
It won't be dark yet
before the fighting starts.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.956
We're gonna see Flint
pay for his crimes.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.425
But we'll do it at home

24:19.526 --> 24:22.294
and we'll do it
like civilized men.

24:22.394 --> 24:25.031
That's how
we avoid the abyss.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.301
We knew you spent the night
drinking together.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.838
How can we take you
at your word?

24:35.274 --> 24:37.209
You don't have
to take my word.

24:43.750 --> 24:45.718
Good enough for you?

24:47.587 --> 24:49.556
Mr. Gates...

24:52.491 --> 24:54.060
Logan:
Sails!

24:54.160 --> 24:55.528
To the south!

24:55.628 --> 24:57.530
Is it the Urca?

25:02.635 --> 25:04.170
Captain,
is it her?

25:04.270 --> 25:06.606
Captain,
is it the Urca?

25:09.576 --> 25:12.511
Man-of-war!
She's a man-of-war!

25:12.612 --> 25:14.213
Spanish banners!

25:14.313 --> 25:16.048
In less than half an hour,
she'll be right on top of us.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.084
Get orders to the Ranger.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.786
Tell her
to raise the black

25:19.886 --> 25:22.454
and fire two shots
over our bow.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.824
- Mr. De Groot.
- Captain?

25:24.924 --> 25:26.993
Rig a spring
to the forward anchor,
then drop her immediately.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.795
Drop anchor?

25:28.895 --> 25:30.529
You mean
to fight her?

25:30.630 --> 25:32.732
You all
have your orders!

25:37.704 --> 25:39.672
Captain, join me.

25:39.772 --> 25:42.609
- We don't have time.
- Make time.

25:48.514 --> 25:50.617
If he engages that ship
in battle, we're dead.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.184
- I know.
- I know you know.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.220
But does Mr. Gates?

26:01.027 --> 26:03.262
I can't let you
go down this road.

26:03.362 --> 26:05.231
As far that
man-of-war knows,

26:05.331 --> 26:07.934
we're Spanish merchantmen
under attack by pirate raiders.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.769
We order
the Ranger to flee,

26:09.869 --> 26:11.270
the Spaniard passes us
to give chase,

26:11.370 --> 26:13.372
and before she realizes her
error, we've got her trapped.

26:13.472 --> 26:15.041
She's got 100 guns.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.777
We do this properly,
she'll never get a chance
to use them.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.411
We'll rake her
stern to bow,

26:19.511 --> 26:20.880
the Ranger will rake
her bow to stern.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.715
With a little luck,
we'll hammer her
into submission

26:22.815 --> 26:24.283
before she can bring
her broadsides to bear.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.552
To accomplish what,
exactly?

26:26.653 --> 26:29.388
The Urca. She's here.
Can't you see that?

26:29.488 --> 26:31.658
All I can see
is an empty bay,

26:31.758 --> 26:33.159
a guardacosta warship,

26:33.259 --> 26:35.194
and a captain that's lost
his fucking grip on reality.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.363
Guardacosta?
You think that ship's
here on patrol?

26:37.463 --> 26:39.832
That she just happened
by this place at this time?

26:39.932 --> 26:41.533
That ship
is an escort.

26:41.634 --> 26:42.802
It's the only
explanation.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.337
The Urca
has no escort.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.274
Was that not
the justification
for this entire endeavor?

26:48.374 --> 26:50.777
They altered their plans.
Found a ship they could spare.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.681
I'm taking the Ranger
and I'm leaving.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.116
What did you
just say?

26:57.216 --> 26:59.986
I'm gonna weigh anchor
and I'm gonna make
a run for it.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.487
If I can keep ahead
of it before dark,

27:01.587 --> 27:03.222
there's just a chance
we can slip away.

27:03.322 --> 27:06.625
Without the Ranger,
I have no chance
against that ship.

27:07.559 --> 27:09.361
I know.

27:14.701 --> 27:17.837
So you're deliberately
challenging my authority here?

27:17.937 --> 27:20.306
Deliberately
violating your duty?

27:22.041 --> 27:24.610
My duty?

27:24.711 --> 27:28.180
My duty is to them,
not to you.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.717
Although I have
violated it more times

27:30.817 --> 27:32.484
than I can remember
in your defense.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.687
Helped you
deceive good men

27:34.787 --> 27:37.489
who put their trust in me
because I was convinced

27:37.589 --> 27:39.458
they would be
better off for it.

27:39.558 --> 27:41.660
Well, not here.
Not this.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.763
This is fucking madness.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.197
Mr. Gates, if you
walk through that door

27:45.297 --> 27:47.266
with the intent
of subverting my plans,

27:47.366 --> 27:50.770
I will have no alternative
but to interpret that as
an incitement of mutiny.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.305
You think
I'm inciting mutiny?

27:53.405 --> 27:55.775
- You are inciting mutiny.
- I'm managing one!

27:55.875 --> 27:58.344
There are men
out there right now

27:58.444 --> 27:59.645
that know
about Singleton,

27:59.746 --> 28:02.114
the book, the cook,
all of it.

28:02.214 --> 28:05.918
They know.
And they mean to see
you hanged for it.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.288
You told them?

28:09.388 --> 28:11.290
After Billy, I just--

28:11.390 --> 28:14.861
I didn't want to believe
you could be capable of doing
something like that.

28:14.961 --> 28:17.363
But I couldn't convince
myself that you weren't.

28:17.463 --> 28:21.700
That's when I realized,
this has got to end.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.836
So what, then?

28:25.337 --> 28:28.207
You preside over a trial
that sees me hanged?

28:30.409 --> 28:31.911
No.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.980
We're going to go home

28:34.080 --> 28:36.783
and I will see you
and Mrs. Barlow secreted away

28:36.883 --> 28:38.885
before anybody
knows you're gone.

28:38.985 --> 28:41.387
You're gonna go
to Boston.

28:41.487 --> 28:44.623
You're gonna take
the pardon that she's
offered you.

28:44.723 --> 28:48.227
And that is the last
that you and I will
ever see of each other.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.031
Please.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.367
Please, don't do this.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.405
I'm sorry.

29:00.672 --> 29:02.374
Take a moment.

29:03.876 --> 29:07.113
I'll deal with them.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.987
( door opens )

29:16.588 --> 29:19.425
( choking )

29:19.525 --> 29:21.660
This is not
what I wanted.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.163
This is not what
I wanted.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.499
( whimpers )
I'm sorry.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.869
( cracks )

29:34.706 --> 29:37.276
I'm sorry.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.480
I'm sorry.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.784
( sobbing )
I'm sorry.

29:47.753 --> 29:49.989
I'm sorry.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.625
( sobs )

29:53.725 --> 29:56.095
I'm sorry.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.968
( door creaks )

30:03.135 --> 30:04.837
I came to lend
credence to your case

30:04.937 --> 30:07.173
that the Urca
is still to be won.

30:18.985 --> 30:21.153
What the fuck
are you doing to him?

30:21.253 --> 30:23.589
- Making sure there's
nothing incriminating--
- Stop. Stop.

30:25.591 --> 30:27.459
There's no way
out of this.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.363
Take it from me,

30:31.463 --> 30:33.832
there's always
a way.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.843
Sir.

30:50.782 --> 30:53.219
- What is it?
- A small band of men were
seen approaching the fort

30:53.319 --> 30:56.688
from the west this morning.
No one's been able
to identify them.

30:56.788 --> 30:58.157
Are all the home crews
accounted for?

30:58.257 --> 31:00.192
Aye. Every one.
They had nothing
to do with this.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.394
Naft: Could this be
a first move by England
to reclaim the island?

31:02.494 --> 31:04.096
Frasier:
Without a single
ship involved?

31:04.196 --> 31:06.966
This does not have
the air of a state move.
This is something else.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.867
Captain, how easily
are the great guns

31:08.968 --> 31:11.370
- on the fort repositioned?
- What difference does
that make?

31:11.470 --> 31:13.105
He's asking if the fort
can turn her guns around

31:13.205 --> 31:15.474
and bring them to bear
on the street-- on us.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.978
Let's hope whomever's
up there is not mad enough
to consider that.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.247
That's less than
confidence-inspiring.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.082
I have lieutenants
calling in favors

31:23.182 --> 31:25.517
from the crews
of the Colonial Dawn
and the Medusa.

31:25.617 --> 31:29.888
I'll have 250 men assembled
and ready to storm the fort
in a matter of hours.

31:29.989 --> 31:33.059
By first light tomorrow,
I'll be back in my chair

31:33.159 --> 31:35.294
and whoever did this
will be hanging by
his goddamn--

31:35.394 --> 31:37.229
- What is it?
- Quick, you all
need to see this.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.539
Man:
Go back inside.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.550
Miss Guthrie.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.522
I think it's time
we talked.

32:16.868 --> 32:19.305
Mr. Gates's heart
has given out.

32:20.906 --> 32:22.108
He's dead?

32:24.043 --> 32:25.911
Mr. Logan.

32:26.012 --> 32:28.047
Signal Mr. Thompson
on the Ranger.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.149
Inform him
he's now in command.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.018
His orders
are to sail north.

32:32.118 --> 32:35.654
When we fire on the target,
he's to tack hard to port
and do the same.

32:35.754 --> 32:38.490
Hoist the signals
from the foremast
below the yard.

32:38.590 --> 32:41.427
Get 'em up
and down quickly before
the Spaniard sees them.

32:53.139 --> 32:56.075
( door closes )

33:02.048 --> 33:04.283
The question you need
to ask yourself

33:04.383 --> 33:07.186
is "What good
can I do?"

33:07.286 --> 33:09.221
You can
call this murder.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.856
A number of the men
might even believe you,

33:10.956 --> 33:13.959
but will that be enough

33:14.060 --> 33:16.228
to stop this fight
that is about to happen?

33:17.529 --> 33:20.266
Because if it's not,
a fight we might win

33:20.366 --> 33:22.734
becomes a battle
we are doomed to lose.

33:22.834 --> 33:26.672
Because the men went into it
infected with your suspicions,

33:26.772 --> 33:29.775
with your doubts.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.880
So, Mr. Quartermaster,

33:34.980 --> 33:38.184
is that truly what's
in their best interests?

33:59.638 --> 34:01.373
St. Augustine.

34:01.473 --> 34:02.808
Beg pardon?

34:02.908 --> 34:04.009
When the warship
draws close,

34:04.110 --> 34:05.844
she'll ask our
last port of call.

34:05.944 --> 34:07.879
St. Augustine's
the closest.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.715
And as she's likely
a customs ship,

34:09.815 --> 34:12.318
we must identify our cargo
as anything but tobacco.

34:12.418 --> 34:15.420
Seville regulates
the trade heavily.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.292
Thank you, Mr. Dufresne.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.246
What the fuck
did you do?

34:41.547 --> 34:43.248
Spend enough time
on an island,

34:43.349 --> 34:46.284
begin to forget
there's a whole world
out there.

34:46.385 --> 34:49.721
A world where the rules
are different.

34:53.525 --> 34:56.594
I went out there,
found men who don't
know the rules here

34:56.695 --> 34:59.531
and who don't much care
to learn them.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.301
They helped me surprise
Captain Hornigold's men,

35:02.401 --> 35:05.837
we took his fort,
and not once were
any of them burdened

35:05.937 --> 35:09.608
with the thought,
"What if this were to
upset Eleanor Guthrie?"

35:11.343 --> 35:14.613
Well, they're about
to learn the rules, Charles.

35:14.713 --> 35:17.316
The hard way.
You think I'm gonna
let this stand?

35:17.416 --> 35:20.252
That Hornigold will?
We have men lining up

35:20.352 --> 35:22.288
in droves to back us
in retaking it.

35:22.388 --> 35:25.123
I'd expect nothing less.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.992
Just out of curiosity,

35:27.092 --> 35:29.528
how long do you think
that's gonna take?

35:29.628 --> 35:33.232
Can you take back
that fort before...

35:33.332 --> 35:35.467
I sink another ship
in the bay?

35:35.567 --> 35:37.736
Three more?

35:37.836 --> 35:39.738
All of them?

35:39.838 --> 35:41.573
Who knows?

35:41.673 --> 35:43.609
If my men hold out
long enough,

35:43.709 --> 35:45.544
we may just decide
to sink the Walrus

35:45.644 --> 35:48.180
when she returns with your
precious Spanish gold

35:48.280 --> 35:50.949
just out of spite.

35:51.049 --> 35:52.884
So that's what this is.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.421
You're annoyed at me,
so you're gonna destroy
everything I've built.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.189
Never said I wanted
to destroy anything.

35:57.289 --> 35:58.957
Then what do you want?

35:59.057 --> 36:01.560
Hornigold
controlled the fort.

36:01.660 --> 36:05.063
The fort controls the bay.
The bay controls commerce.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.932
That meant
he was your partner.

36:07.032 --> 36:10.869
Now, I control
the fort.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.506
So I will be
your partner.

36:15.441 --> 36:17.343
You are kidding me.

36:17.443 --> 36:19.511
I was a tenant in this
place for a long time.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.313
Didn't work out
so well.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.215
Now I'd like a stake.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.784
You've absolutely
lost your mind.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.020
I remember
the first time I saw you.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.857
You were about 13.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.692
You'd snuck down
to the beach

36:33.792 --> 36:36.027
despite Mr. Scott's
rules forbidding it.

36:36.127 --> 36:38.964
A girl that age

36:39.064 --> 36:41.500
looking like you did.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.870
And you just walked up
and down between the camps

36:44.970 --> 36:46.905
like you owned the place.

36:47.005 --> 36:48.374
Fearless.

36:48.474 --> 36:51.810
Then you saw me
watching you and you
didn't look away.

36:51.910 --> 36:53.979
Didn't cower.

36:54.079 --> 36:56.248
You just gave me
this look--

36:56.348 --> 36:58.384
this little smile--

36:58.484 --> 37:01.152
that said you refused
to be afraid of me.

37:01.253 --> 37:04.122
What the fuck
are you talking about?

37:04.222 --> 37:06.758
I know you.

37:06.858 --> 37:09.961
Better than your father,
better than Scott.

37:10.061 --> 37:11.397
Maybe better than anyone.

37:11.497 --> 37:14.366
You don't give a shit
about money or respect.

37:14.466 --> 37:17.002
Or the things
you've built here.

37:17.102 --> 37:19.305
I think you're just tired
of fathers

37:19.405 --> 37:21.640
telling you what to do.

37:22.974 --> 37:26.745
And so I'm offering you
a life free from them.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.949
With me in that fort,
you do as you like.

37:31.049 --> 37:32.784
As long as it
doesn't cross me,

37:32.884 --> 37:35.854
you'll hear
no complaints.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.492
You know I have no choice
but to say yes.

37:41.627 --> 37:44.296
But before I do,
know this,

37:44.396 --> 37:47.899
you'll sit
in that fort for a while.
You'll get comfortable.

37:47.999 --> 37:52.137
And that's the day
I'm gonna push you
and your men

37:52.237 --> 37:54.806
right into
the fucking sea.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.511
God, I missed that look.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.653
Ben.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.492
What the hell
did he say?

38:13.592 --> 38:16.495
He wants your seat
on the consortium.
To be a partner to us.

38:16.595 --> 38:20.265
Well, I have 300 men out there
more than happy to deny him.

38:20.366 --> 38:22.100
- You can't, Ben.
- Oh, watch me.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.436
I told him
about the tunnels.

38:24.536 --> 38:27.939
The tunnels that you would
use to launch a surprise
attack into the fort.

38:28.039 --> 38:30.376
- I told him.
- Jesus!

38:30.476 --> 38:33.044
You told me to keep emotion
from clouding judgment.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.414
To act in everyone's
best interest.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.148
I believe that's
what I'm doing.

38:37.248 --> 38:40.085
This is not
the end of this.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.158
Captain.
Welcome back.

38:47.258 --> 38:49.561
I hear congratulations
are in order.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.598
Steward of the fort.
Stroke of pure genius.

38:52.698 --> 38:55.467
In some ways, Jack,
it had to come to this.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.736
- Don't you think?
- Come to what?

38:57.836 --> 39:00.338
Me deciding
if you live or die.

39:00.439 --> 39:01.507
Captain, I don't know
what you've heard--

39:01.607 --> 39:03.709
Hamund pulls you
out of bed...

39:04.810 --> 39:07.312
marches you down
to the wrecks

39:07.413 --> 39:11.182
to look for a stash
of stolen pearls.

39:11.282 --> 39:15.454
And somehow,
only you and your dog
make it back alive.

39:17.656 --> 39:20.358
- ( sighs )
- Quite a moment.

39:20.459 --> 39:23.462
Jack Rackham
with nothing to say.

39:23.562 --> 39:26.798
Had I a shrewd
quartermaster right now,

39:26.898 --> 39:29.601
he would tell me
that I can't let
what you did stand.

39:29.701 --> 39:31.903
He would say an offense
like that

39:32.003 --> 39:34.640
demanded an example
be made of both of you.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.409
The bloodier the better.

39:40.712 --> 39:44.215
But today,
I'm a little less worried

39:44.315 --> 39:47.052
about perception
than I used to be.

39:47.152 --> 39:49.287
As long as I hold
that fort,

39:49.387 --> 39:51.389
doesn't really matter.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.563
So the street
will know what you did.

39:57.663 --> 40:01.600
They will know
you betrayed your
brothers for a woman.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.504
That story will spread
far and wide

40:05.604 --> 40:07.839
and you'll never sail
beneath the black again.

40:09.608 --> 40:12.611
You'll sit
in this place and rot

40:12.711 --> 40:15.447
with the rest
of the whores.

40:16.815 --> 40:19.618
Something tells me that'll
sting worse than dying.

40:21.487 --> 40:23.288
Loyalty, Jack.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.190
It's supposed
to mean something.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.959
It does to me, anyway.

40:30.395 --> 40:32.564
Oh.

40:32.664 --> 40:35.501
Love what you've
done with the place.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.216
( speaking Spanish )

40:56.454 --> 40:57.689
Here she comes.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.833
( speaking Spanish )

41:09.501 --> 41:12.437
Cazadora.
Marco Fernandez, captain.

41:12.538 --> 41:16.608
Cazadora.
Marco Fernandez, capitán.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.844
( speaking Spanish )

41:22.514 --> 41:25.283
St, Augustine.
Tobacco trade.

41:25.383 --> 41:27.919
( speaking Spanish )

41:31.890 --> 41:34.359
If I'm not mistaken,
you told him to name us

41:34.459 --> 41:36.027
anything but a tobacco
trader, did you not?

41:36.127 --> 41:37.763
I did.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.999
He means to prove that
that ship is not guardacosta.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.500
That it's here for
the same reason we are.

41:42.601 --> 41:44.402
The Urca.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.937
That ship lets us pass,

41:46.037 --> 41:48.473
he will have managed to both
renew the men's lust for gold

41:48.574 --> 41:51.442
and their faith
in his judgment.

41:51.543 --> 41:53.645
( speaking Spanish )

42:06.457 --> 42:08.193
Hello.

42:19.838 --> 42:21.472
All hands
to their stations.

42:21.573 --> 42:23.341
Quietly, if you please.

42:23.441 --> 42:25.310
At 300 yards,
we open fire.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.915
Time and again
he gambles with our lives.

42:30.015 --> 42:32.784
That is, when he's not
taking them in cold blood.

42:32.884 --> 42:36.254
And once more
his influence grows.

42:36.354 --> 42:38.523
And we're at his mercy
with no way to challenge him.

42:38.624 --> 42:40.358
No, sir.

42:40.458 --> 42:43.061
It only looks that way.

42:53.839 --> 42:55.506
Turn us around
slowly, boys.

42:55.607 --> 42:57.643
They need to think
we're just drifting.

43:15.026 --> 43:16.427
Range?

43:16.527 --> 43:18.229
Hundred yards,
Captain.

43:23.234 --> 43:25.136
- Open.
- Crewman: Open.

43:28.306 --> 43:31.142
( men shouting )

43:36.815 --> 43:38.616
- Come right a few degrees.
- Aye, Captain.

43:38.717 --> 43:41.887
We only get one shot at this.
We miss, we die.

43:41.987 --> 43:45.556
- Clear, tack hull.
- Range?

43:45.657 --> 43:47.726
Approaching
200 yards, Captain.

43:47.826 --> 43:50.729
All crews,
fire on my mark.

43:52.497 --> 43:54.332
Steady.

43:58.436 --> 44:00.238
Almost there.

44:02.107 --> 44:04.876
Captain Flint.

44:06.277 --> 44:09.848
As quartermaster,
I hereby accuse you

44:09.948 --> 44:12.150
of tyrannical crimes
against your crew.

44:12.250 --> 44:14.285
All crews, fire!

44:14.385 --> 44:16.888
Dufresne:
Belay that order!

44:21.026 --> 44:23.995
Your duties
as a member of this crew
have reached an end.

44:24.095 --> 44:26.297
Take a seat.

44:27.799 --> 44:31.336
Beginning with the murders
of Mr. Singleton,

44:31.436 --> 44:34.672
Billy Bones,
and Mr. Gates.

44:34.773 --> 44:37.508
What exactly do you hope
to accomplish by doing this?

44:37.608 --> 44:40.278
In your case,
Mr. Silver, justice.

44:40.378 --> 44:43.715
Once Dufresne
exposes Flint's lies
in their totality,

44:43.815 --> 44:45.183
the crew are gonna want
answers from you, too.

44:45.283 --> 44:47.452
And as I explained
to Mr. Dufresne,

44:47.552 --> 44:49.487
it's his word
against Flint's.

44:49.587 --> 44:50.856
Why would anyone
believe him?

44:50.956 --> 44:53.558
I hold in my hand
a letter

44:53.658 --> 44:57.228
written by Mr. Gates
confessing his knowledge

44:57.328 --> 45:00.298
and complicity in
the captain's myriad crimes.

45:00.398 --> 45:03.301
We're going to lose them.
We don't have time for this.

45:03.401 --> 45:07.806
As well as his knowledge
of the captain's continued
treachery

45:07.906 --> 45:11.877
up to and including
his plan to steal

45:11.977 --> 45:15.680
a portion of the treasure
fleet proceeds for himself.

45:15.781 --> 45:18.183
I gave you all an order!
Fire!

45:20.685 --> 45:22.220
Fire!

45:24.455 --> 45:26.357
Mr. Logan.

45:31.496 --> 45:33.064
It's in Mr. Gates's hand.

45:34.332 --> 45:36.367
Where are you going?

45:38.203 --> 45:40.071
- ( gunshot flashes )
- ( grunts )

45:43.574 --> 45:45.977
( groans )

45:53.318 --> 45:55.486
( grunting )

45:59.590 --> 46:01.659
Justice, thief.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.261
This time there's
no escaping it.

46:07.933 --> 46:10.768
You're welcome.

46:10.869 --> 46:14.372
Raise the sails.
We're going home.

46:23.248 --> 46:25.016
Who's shooting?!

46:25.116 --> 46:27.552
Sorry.

46:27.652 --> 46:29.287
Had to be done.

46:30.488 --> 46:32.257
There's no running now.

46:35.994 --> 46:38.864
Logan:
The Ranger's coming about.

46:38.964 --> 46:42.934
The Spaniards have got
men in the rigging.

46:43.034 --> 46:45.470
Fire, Mr. Dufresne.
Everything you've got.

46:45.570 --> 46:47.205
Don't waste
this moment.

46:58.683 --> 47:00.285
( cannon fire blasts )

47:03.721 --> 47:06.591
All cannons,
open fire!

47:06.691 --> 47:08.826
Open fire!

47:17.568 --> 47:20.138
( cheering )

47:21.139 --> 47:23.942
( shouting )
Reload!

47:26.311 --> 47:29.314
Gunner:
Ready with this cannon!

47:29.414 --> 47:30.581
Fire!

47:30.681 --> 47:32.650
The Ranger's opened fire!

47:32.750 --> 47:33.952
Again!

47:44.529 --> 47:46.531
...Fire!

47:51.569 --> 47:53.972
She's coming about!

47:56.574 --> 47:57.943
Fire!

48:06.784 --> 48:08.987
Fire!

48:11.856 --> 48:13.458
Below!

48:17.495 --> 48:20.465
To your stations!

48:28.606 --> 48:31.009
( cannon fire roars )

48:41.652 --> 48:43.554
( screams )

48:48.793 --> 48:50.095
( screams )

48:51.729 --> 48:53.231
Set sail!

49:01.106 --> 49:03.174
( men shouting, screaming )

49:09.647 --> 49:11.082
( screams )

49:14.052 --> 49:16.487
Doctor! Doctor!

49:25.963 --> 49:28.066
( screams )

49:36.574 --> 49:38.609
( screams fade )

49:56.327 --> 49:59.497
- ( men screaming )
- ( gasps )

50:36.167 --> 50:38.136
Max:
No-man's-land.

50:39.737 --> 50:42.240
There was a time
when stopping halfway
across this bridge

50:42.340 --> 50:44.008
would have been
unthinkable to you.

50:44.109 --> 50:46.677
How things change.

50:46.777 --> 50:48.079
I can see that.

50:52.917 --> 50:55.186
Max, I know
we haven't spoken,

50:55.286 --> 50:56.787
but I just want you
to know how sorry I am--

50:56.887 --> 50:58.689
Don't.

51:00.558 --> 51:03.661
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

51:03.761 --> 51:06.897
I was standing between
you and your dreams
for this place.

51:06.997 --> 51:08.466
You did
what you had to do.

51:08.566 --> 51:11.602
I thought you said
this place was just sand.

51:11.702 --> 51:13.771
Sand has
its virtues.

51:13.871 --> 51:15.573
On sand,
nothing is fixed.

51:15.673 --> 51:17.375
Nothing is permanent.

51:17.475 --> 51:19.510
And fates change
so quickly.

51:19.610 --> 51:22.913
Yesterday Captain Hornigold
was immovable from that fort

51:23.013 --> 51:26.083
and Captain Vane
was a beggar.

51:26.184 --> 51:27.618
Now look at them today.

51:27.718 --> 51:31.456
Yesterday I was a whore
of little consequence,

51:31.556 --> 51:33.458
easily dismissed,

51:33.558 --> 51:35.226
easily forgotten.

51:35.326 --> 51:37.328
Today I am a madam

51:37.428 --> 51:40.097
with an income
and allies

51:40.198 --> 51:44.769
and a woman
who has learned the most
important of lessons.

51:44.869 --> 51:48.473
Never let anyone
stand in between you
and your ambitions.

51:50.175 --> 51:52.310
Thank you for
teaching it to me.

51:54.379 --> 51:56.614
Ma'am,
they're ready.

51:58.483 --> 52:01.786
Congratulations on
the launch of your
endeavor, by the way.

52:01.886 --> 52:05.356
Today you have everything
you have ever wanted.

52:07.392 --> 52:10.328
I suppose we can only guess
what tomorrow will bring.

53:18.028 --> 53:20.265
( coughing )

53:35.546 --> 53:37.915
They think it'll be a while
before she sails again.

53:40.518 --> 53:42.587
In the meantime,
you and I have been charged

53:42.687 --> 53:45.656
with provoking
this whole mess.

53:54.965 --> 53:57.001
Why am I still alive?

53:58.235 --> 54:00.471
Why didn't you kill me?

54:05.976 --> 54:07.278
Get him up.

54:19.657 --> 54:21.492
( groans )

54:34.305 --> 54:38.175
Told you I was certain
about my information
regarding the Urca.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.945
Unfortunately, you and I
failed to take into
account the weather.

54:58.763 --> 55:01.432
The Urca de Lima wrecked
at sea last night.

55:01.532 --> 55:03.334
Dashed by the storm.

55:49.113 --> 55:52.517
( theme music playing )
