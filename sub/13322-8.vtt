00:00.870 --> 00:02.235
<i>Previously on</i> The Fosters...

00:02.271 --> 00:04.372
Oh, don't forget you're picking up
Mason from preschool this afternoon.

00:04.407 --> 00:06.140
I was hoping I could get
some time to practice.

00:06.175 --> 00:07.441
There's not a lot of
time before the audition.

00:07.477 --> 00:10.311
His moms are blaming him for
everything that happened with Callie.

00:10.346 --> 00:12.085
What do you mean, "everything
that happened with Callie"?

00:12.086 --> 00:13.286
They had sex.

00:13.316 --> 00:15.549
We don't have time to keep
building and rebuilding this robot

00:15.585 --> 00:18.219
if we want to be ready for
competition in three days.

00:18.254 --> 00:20.454
But you do have time to go visit Nick?

00:20.490 --> 00:23.457
- Mariana: He's locked up.
- Not that locked up if he has access to a phone

00:23.493 --> 00:24.659
<i>and is texting you constantly.</i>

00:24.694 --> 00:26.594
Callie: <i>Look, an innocent
17-year-old kid is gonna spend</i>

00:26.629 --> 00:29.330
the rest of his life in prison
if you don't tell the truth.

00:29.365 --> 00:31.232
You need to leave me alone.

00:31.267 --> 00:34.368
I have some tax issues with the IRS.

00:34.404 --> 00:36.303
- We're selling the house.
- Mariana: Why?

00:36.339 --> 00:37.438
You're kidding me, right?

00:38.708 --> 00:40.541
Woman: Well, we obviously
can't show the house like this.

00:40.576 --> 00:42.510
I mean, you're gonna need to
get rid of half the furniture

00:42.545 --> 00:44.545
- and all of this... clutter.
- (piano music playing)

00:44.580 --> 00:45.613
And these are gonna have to go.

00:45.648 --> 00:47.615
People want to picture
their lives in the home,

00:47.650 --> 00:49.183
not yours.

00:49.218 --> 00:50.184
Mariana: Moms!

00:51.421 --> 00:53.487
The robotics competition is tomorrow.

00:53.523 --> 00:56.157
Can't Brandon take a
break for like 20 minutes?

00:56.192 --> 00:59.160
I'm trying to think in C++,
but all I can hear is C-minor.

00:59.195 --> 01:01.195
- Brandon: Major.
- Please.

01:01.230 --> 01:03.097
(sighs) Sorry.

01:03.132 --> 01:06.133
And have you considered having
the house professionally cleaned?

01:06.169 --> 01:08.169
(sighs)

01:08.204 --> 01:10.504
(music continues, muffled)

01:13.309 --> 01:18.145
- Sounds like Brandon's here.
- Yeah, he has his Juilliard audition in a couple of days.

01:18.181 --> 01:21.248
Hey, I was thinking maybe
tomorrow after school,

01:21.284 --> 01:26.287
I could come over. I mean, if you're
sure that Mike will be at work.

01:26.322 --> 01:29.290
- (giggles)
- Yeah, well...

01:29.325 --> 01:31.325
Mike doesn't want us
hooking up at the apartment.

01:33.229 --> 01:34.562
- Uh-huh.
- Mmm.

01:34.597 --> 01:38.165
Okay, so where does
Mike want us hooking up?

01:38.201 --> 01:41.302
- (both laugh)
- Well, Mike didn't say.

01:43.339 --> 01:45.139
I mean, he'd probably never know.

01:45.174 --> 01:47.575
No, no. I mean, if he
doesn't want me there.

01:47.610 --> 01:51.312
I... I just think it's because he kind
of sees you like a daughter, in a way.

01:55.184 --> 01:58.452
- How about here?
- When is there not someone at my house?

01:58.488 --> 02:00.354
When they're at school and work.

02:03.359 --> 02:05.159
And what are these?

02:05.194 --> 02:08.229
Oh, those are case
file... It's a long story.

02:08.264 --> 02:09.530
Okay, well, they're
gonna need to be moved.

02:09.565 --> 02:13.100
So, how soon do we think we
can get this place presentable?

02:13.136 --> 02:16.537
Uhh... umm... a couple of weeks?

02:16.572 --> 02:17.875
Let's say a week.

02:17.876 --> 02:20.018
We're coming up on the holidays,
nobody's house-hunting then.

02:20.375 --> 02:22.276
Okay, we will do the best we can.

02:22.311 --> 02:24.145
Thank you. Thank you very much.

02:25.381 --> 02:27.481
- Hi, AJ.
- Uh, hey.

02:27.517 --> 02:29.250
(music continues)

02:29.285 --> 02:32.153
- So, I'll... I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

02:32.188 --> 02:33.354
All right.

02:35.224 --> 02:36.524
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:36.559 --> 02:39.493
- So, as I was saying...
- Mariana: How much does the robot weigh?

02:39.529 --> 02:42.429
- 117 lbs!
- Mariana: What's the weight limit?

02:42.465 --> 02:43.597
Jesus: 120!

02:43.633 --> 02:44.598
Bye.

02:46.369 --> 02:47.535
Uh, excuse me.

02:47.570 --> 02:49.336
(clears throat)

02:49.372 --> 02:51.305
Hello. Hi.

02:52.408 --> 02:53.440
- Sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

02:53.476 --> 02:55.476
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

02:55.511 --> 02:56.510
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:56.546 --> 02:59.346
- Mariana: I didn't hear you!
- 120!

02:59.382 --> 03:01.081
- Mariana: What?
- One...

03:01.117 --> 03:03.083
Jesus, can you just go up there, please?

03:03.119 --> 03:05.386
Hey, stop yelling! We have company!

03:07.256 --> 03:09.490
So, this should go without
saying, but we're gonna need

03:09.525 --> 03:11.458
all of the kids out of
the house for the showings.

03:11.494 --> 03:16.530
We want people to experience
this as a quiet and serene home,

03:16.566 --> 03:19.266
not a college dorm. Okay?

03:19.302 --> 03:20.334
Okay.

03:22.505 --> 03:26.273
Oh, hello. We're looking
for a Callie Adams Foster.

03:26.309 --> 03:28.309
Okay then, talk soon.

03:28.344 --> 03:31.245
(sighs) Brandon, can you
please stop for a minute?

03:31.280 --> 03:33.147
- (music stops)
- I'm Callie's mom.

03:33.182 --> 03:34.415
What do you need to see her for?

03:35.585 --> 03:37.518
- What's going on?
- Are you Callie?

03:37.553 --> 03:41.322
- Yes.
- Do you know a man named Patrick Molloy?

- Not at all.

04:29.178 --> 04:31.378
Thank you for stopping
by. Be safe, guys.

04:31.414 --> 04:32.446
Thank you.

04:34.116 --> 04:35.316
(long sigh)

04:39.388 --> 04:41.388
You went by his work
several times, Callie?

04:41.424 --> 04:43.257
It was only twice.

04:43.292 --> 04:45.092
He's accusing you of harassment.

04:45.127 --> 04:46.527
This is serious, Callie.

04:46.562 --> 04:48.529
All I did was try to
talk to him about Kyle.

04:48.564 --> 04:50.464
You told his boss he's a child molester.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.266
- Well, he is.
- Stef: I understand

04:52.301 --> 04:54.201
that you're upset, okay? I am too,

04:54.237 --> 04:56.170
but I am already looking into Molloy

04:56.205 --> 04:58.272
and why the molestation
charges were dropped.

04:58.307 --> 05:00.040
We know why they were dropped.

05:00.076 --> 05:02.076
He made a deal with the
detective on Kyle's case.

05:02.111 --> 05:04.111
He changes his story and in return,

05:04.146 --> 05:06.146
he gets away with abusing some poor kid,

05:06.182 --> 05:07.481
and Kyle goes to prison
for the rest of his life

05:07.516 --> 05:10.084
for something he didn't
do. It's not right.

05:10.119 --> 05:12.219
We don't know that a
deal was made, Callie.

05:12.255 --> 05:16.290
But regardless, listen, I am
the police officer here, okay?

05:16.325 --> 05:19.193
Please let me handle
this. Do you understand?

05:21.130 --> 05:22.329
Callie.

05:23.499 --> 05:24.498
Okay.

05:27.436 --> 05:30.104
- (sighs)
- Can I go?

05:30.139 --> 05:31.205
Yes.

05:32.441 --> 05:35.075
Oh, hey, we need to clean out the house,

05:35.111 --> 05:36.310
so I need you to take those case files

05:36.345 --> 05:38.078
back to wherever you got them, please.

05:40.383 --> 05:41.415
(sighs)

05:43.255 --> 05:44.555
I don't want her involved in this.

05:44.590 --> 05:47.324
She has enough to focus
on with her senior project

05:47.360 --> 05:49.159
and where the hell's she's
gonna apply to college.

05:49.195 --> 05:50.561
I don't need her solving cold cases.

05:50.596 --> 05:52.429
I hear you. I do.

05:52.465 --> 05:56.133
(sighs) And hopefully, with those
police officers stopping by here tonight,

05:56.168 --> 05:58.502
she is no longer gonna be
playing amateur detective.

05:58.537 --> 06:00.204
- Okay?
- She better not.

06:00.239 --> 06:02.206
You know what? It would
be great if you could focus

06:02.241 --> 06:04.241
a little more on what's
going on at home, too.

06:04.276 --> 06:05.542
We've got enough on our plate right now.

Emcee on P.A.: Welcome
to the FIRST Robotics

07:20.152 --> 07:22.219
Southern California
Regional Competition.

07:22.254 --> 07:25.122
Every team must have
their robot inspected

07:25.157 --> 07:26.356
before our games begin.

07:26.392 --> 07:28.092
And once you're cleared to play,

07:28.127 --> 07:31.095
one of our referees will run down
the rules of today's tournament.

07:31.130 --> 07:33.497
Next up at the weigh
station, the Bagel Bytes.

07:33.532 --> 07:35.466
Academics, you're on deck.

07:35.501 --> 07:38.102
Hey, hey, let's not
be intimidated, okay?

07:38.137 --> 07:39.303
You guys are ready.

07:39.338 --> 07:41.472
Remember the FIRST Robotics mantra?

07:41.507 --> 07:45.109
Group: Gracious professionalism
and "coopertition."

07:45.144 --> 07:47.177
Yeah. Oh, great.

07:49.148 --> 07:51.482
- Who's that?
- Palomar Academy.

07:51.517 --> 07:53.584
Regional champs the last four years.

07:53.619 --> 07:56.320
- They're all, like, adults.
- Is that allowed?

07:56.355 --> 07:58.122
Craig: It's a little controversial.

07:58.157 --> 08:00.390
Their "coach" is an aerospace engineer.

08:00.426 --> 08:03.360
All the other mentors also worked
in the field, one way or another,

08:03.395 --> 08:06.530
but technically, yeah, it's allowed.

08:06.565 --> 08:09.199
What, so they need two mentors per kid?

08:09.235 --> 08:11.368
Hey, good to see you again, Greg.

08:11.403 --> 08:13.303
It's Craig. You know it's Craig.

08:13.339 --> 08:17.441
Right. Look, we're in the
same alliance this first round,

08:17.476 --> 08:21.512
which means your team
should be sitting pretty

08:21.547 --> 08:24.148
- when we start round two.
- (chuckles)

08:24.183 --> 08:26.416
- You're welcome.
- (laughs)

08:28.354 --> 08:31.421
Go, Team Palomar! Systems check in five!

08:31.457 --> 08:34.491
- We're never gonna beat them.
- Hey, never say never.

08:34.527 --> 08:38.361
And winning isn't everything.
Remember, guys, this is a coopertition.

08:38.397 --> 08:41.365
Huh? Okay, let's weigh this thing in.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.101
(emcee speaks indiscernibly)

08:45.271 --> 08:46.470
Look who's here.

08:47.540 --> 08:49.573
- Hey there.
- What are you doing here?

08:49.678 --> 08:51.578
Just came to watch you lose.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.514
Oh yeah? Well, you're
gonna be very disappointed.

08:54.550 --> 08:58.619
- So, you got a hanging arm?
- Yeah, we do.

08:58.654 --> 09:02.155
- And it works?
- Why would we have a hanging arm if it didn't work?

09:02.191 --> 09:04.191
We also have an autonomous program.

09:04.226 --> 09:07.561
- And it's a great high shooter.
- Well, we'll see, I guess.

09:07.596 --> 09:09.129
Let's go.

09:11.533 --> 09:13.600
Yeah, losing is not an option.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.203
Understood?

09:16.272 --> 09:18.505
If we don't make the top
six, I'm gonna kill somebody.

09:18.540 --> 09:21.608
- (beeps)
- 120.5.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.343
You're half a pound overweight.

09:24.380 --> 09:26.280
You told me it was 117 lbs.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.614
Well, yeah, that's what Emma said.

09:27.650 --> 09:30.217
Wow. Way to throw me under the bus.

09:30.252 --> 09:31.251
(mouths)

09:32.521 --> 09:34.254
I weighed it on my bathroom scale.

09:34.290 --> 09:37.524
- Your bathroom scale?
- Sorry. It's all I had.

09:37.559 --> 09:39.359
Okay, well, what if we
take the hanging arm off?

09:39.395 --> 09:41.194
No!

09:41.230 --> 09:43.497
- (whispers) It doesn't work.
- Nobody knows that.

09:43.532 --> 09:46.199
And the potential of it working
makes us more of a threat.

09:46.235 --> 09:47.334
Penny: Guys, we have to do something.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.269
First round starts in 15 minutes.

09:51.206 --> 09:54.241
It's just half a pound.
Can't you just let it slide?

09:54.276 --> 09:55.947
Sorry, Anchor Beach.
You don't make weight,

09:55.948 --> 09:57.580
 you're not eligible to compete.

10:00.683 --> 10:03.517
Now remember, the house
hasn't been staged yet,

10:03.552 --> 10:05.619
so you're gonna need
to use your imagination.

10:05.654 --> 10:08.255
But since you're only in town today,
I'm gonna give you a sneak peek.

10:08.290 --> 10:10.357
Thank you. Great bones.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.659
So, why don't we start
upstairs and work our way down?

10:15.397 --> 10:20.233
All right. Two teenage
boys live in this room,

10:20.269 --> 10:21.668
so hold your breath. (Chuckles)

10:21.704 --> 10:24.471
- Is this your first child?
- No, we... we have a three-year-old boy.

10:24.506 --> 10:26.606
- And we're having a girl.
- Oh, well, that's perfect,

10:26.642 --> 10:28.442
because one of the great
features of this house

10:28.477 --> 10:30.243
is the Jack and Jill bathroom.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.379
That was Jack...

10:36.352 --> 10:38.251
and this is Jill.

10:40.422 --> 10:43.357
So, the natural light
that this room gets...

10:43.392 --> 10:45.425
- (gasps) Oh my God.
- Oh.

10:45.461 --> 10:47.594
- Oh my God!
- Sorry.

10:47.629 --> 10:49.396
Apparently, Jill has company.

10:49.431 --> 10:51.398
- Yeah, we didn't know anyone...
- I can see that.

10:51.433 --> 10:55.402
So, let's just continue
on to the master, shall we?

10:55.437 --> 10:56.470
Woman: Mm-hmm.

10:57.673 --> 10:58.638
I'm sorry.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.481
I don't think the universe
wants us having sex.

11:07.516 --> 11:09.549
(both laugh)

11:09.585 --> 11:13.253
Mariana: I can't believe I let you put
all of these holes in my beautiful robot.

11:13.288 --> 11:15.389
Jesus: Well, it got the
weight out, didn't it?

11:15.424 --> 11:16.656
Tray on.

11:16.692 --> 11:19.659
- (rock music playing)
- (people chattering)

11:22.698 --> 11:26.566
Referee: Okay, remember, the
first 15 seconds of each round

11:26.602 --> 11:29.236
are for autonomous drive only.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.606
Drivers must keep their hands
off the controls during this time.

11:32.641 --> 11:35.542
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we all
know what "autonomous" means.

11:35.577 --> 11:37.411
What the hell happened to your robot?

11:38.647 --> 11:40.614
We just had a weight issue,

11:40.649 --> 11:44.251
- but we're good now.
- Yeah, we cheese-holed it.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.453
I can see that.

11:46.488 --> 11:49.489
When the buzzer sounds, we
start the tele-op portion,

11:49.525 --> 11:52.626
so you can go ahead and grab your
controls and operate manually.

11:52.661 --> 11:54.694
You should've taken the hanging arm off.

11:54.730 --> 11:56.596
Referee: ... clearing
defenses, shooting boulders,

11:56.632 --> 11:58.265
and scaling the tower.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.499
Good luck.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.503
Hey, rookie mistake,
trying to hang a robot.

12:03.539 --> 12:06.540
Not if it works. Scaling the
tower gets you the most points.

12:06.575 --> 12:09.209
Yeah, well, that's fool's gold, right?

12:09.244 --> 12:11.511
A strong, consistent
robot always wins the day.

12:11.547 --> 12:14.281
I'm surprised Greg didn't tell you that.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.616
Well, we let the kids
make the decisions.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.619
since this is a high school
competition, not Boeing.

12:21.223 --> 12:23.323
Palomar has won four years in a row.

12:23.358 --> 12:25.659
How many times has
Anchor Beach even placed?

12:27.229 --> 12:31.631
Exactly. Help us help
you learn something, okay?

12:34.403 --> 12:37.471
One, forget him. Two, you've got this.

12:37.506 --> 12:38.572
Come on, guys.

12:40.409 --> 12:43.276
So, what is the highest
that we've ever placed?

12:43.312 --> 12:46.346
Eleventh, back in 2010.

12:46.381 --> 12:49.249
Okay, so maybe douchey
does know something.

12:49.284 --> 12:52.319
Maybe, but he doesn't have
to be so douchey about it.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.655
Hear ye, hear ye! Lords and ladies,

12:55.691 --> 12:57.624
welcome to the FIRST Robotics

12:57.659 --> 13:00.494
Southern California
Regional Competition!

13:00.529 --> 13:03.530
Today's tournament
will be an epic contest

13:03.565 --> 13:07.300
between worthy champions
representing many kingdoms.

13:07.336 --> 13:10.337
- Whoa. This... this is...
- Amazing.

13:10.372 --> 13:13.206
Emcee: ... battle in a joust of the mind.

13:13.242 --> 13:15.509
And so, without any further folly,

13:15.544 --> 13:17.277
let the games begin!

13:17.312 --> 13:20.380
(cheering)

13:20.415 --> 13:22.582
Alliances! To your driver stations.

13:24.219 --> 13:25.252
Good luck.

13:28.690 --> 13:31.224
Go, Anchor Beach Anchor Bytes!

13:31.260 --> 13:34.261
- Oh my God, what is she doing here?
- Whoo! Whoo!

13:34.296 --> 13:35.662
Drivers, behind the line!

13:35.697 --> 13:40.534
- And three, two, one. Charge!
- (buzzer)

13:40.569 --> 13:43.403
- And the games are on!
- (beeping, whirring)

13:43.438 --> 13:45.605
Red alliance is off to a quick start.

13:46.675 --> 13:47.674
What's happening?

13:49.378 --> 13:51.378
- Nothing.
- Yes, I can see that.

13:53.315 --> 13:55.682
- Maybe it's a problem with our code?
- I quadruple checked it.

13:55.717 --> 13:58.418
Emcee: Anchor Beach did not
code an autonomous program.

13:58.453 --> 14:00.287
- Oh no.
- Emcee: They'll have to make up a lot of ground

14:00.322 --> 14:02.556
- in the tele-op portion of the round.
- Oh no, no, no, no, no!

14:04.665 --> 14:07.429
What the hell is happening?
Are you kidding me?

14:07.749 --> 14:10.649
Come on, guys, get that thing moving!

14:10.685 --> 14:12.685
Dudes, this is a disaster.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.754
Why is there a grown man
yelling at my daughter?

14:14.789 --> 14:17.423
He's Palomar's coach.

14:17.458 --> 14:19.558
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- Excuse me.

14:19.594 --> 14:20.726
Lyons: Come on, come on!

14:20.762 --> 14:22.428
- (emcee speaking)
- Are you kidding me?

14:24.432 --> 14:26.632
I am not letting you guys drag us down!

14:26.667 --> 14:28.868
Excuse me. Excuse me. This
is a student competition,

14:28.903 --> 14:30.770
so how about we just bring
it down a couple of notches?

14:30.805 --> 14:33.572
Oh, because I am just doing my job here

14:33.608 --> 14:34.874
and if you don't have a
reason to be back here,

14:34.909 --> 14:36.876
you should be in the stands
with the normal people.

14:36.911 --> 14:38.611
Or better yet, how about you pack up

14:38.646 --> 14:41.413
your useless team and go home, okay?

14:41.449 --> 14:43.516
Emcee: Palomar and
Hamilton giving it their all

14:43.551 --> 14:45.851
despite the Anchor weighing them down.

14:47.488 --> 14:49.688
- Brandon!
- Hey, buddy.

14:49.724 --> 14:51.724
(grunts) How's it going?

14:51.759 --> 14:54.527
- (chuckles)
- What's this? Oh, is that for me?

14:54.562 --> 14:56.729
- Yeah.
- I'll... I'll put it in my locker, okay?

14:56.764 --> 15:00.566
Sorry. I picked him up from preschool
and he really wanted to see you.

15:00.601 --> 15:02.635
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

15:02.670 --> 15:04.637
(Mason babbles)

15:04.672 --> 15:06.372
We missed you last night.

15:06.407 --> 15:08.440
Yeah, I missed you guys too.

15:08.476 --> 15:10.743
I was just practicing so late that...

15:12.513 --> 15:15.381
Oh yeah, no, I get it.

15:15.416 --> 15:18.584
- How's it going?
- All right, I guess.

15:18.619 --> 15:20.586
Kinda feels like I'm cramming

15:20.621 --> 15:22.521
for the biggest test
I've ever had to take.

15:23.558 --> 15:24.623
You're gonna be great.

15:25.793 --> 15:28.561
So, am I gonna see you tonight?

15:28.596 --> 15:31.530
Uh, yeah, yeah, I think so.

15:31.566 --> 15:33.699
It might be late again, but...

15:33.734 --> 15:36.435
- Yeah. No pressure.
- (both chuckle)

15:36.470 --> 15:37.469
I... I know.

15:38.739 --> 15:40.706
Um, are we...

15:41.776 --> 15:44.643
- Are we okay?
- What do you mean?

15:44.679 --> 15:48.480
Are you still upset about
what I told your dad?

15:49.884 --> 15:51.784
- Cort, we already talked about this.
- (Mason babbles)

15:51.819 --> 15:54.653
I know, but are you sure
that's not the reason

15:54.689 --> 15:57.556
- why you didn't come home last night?
- Cortney...

16:00.428 --> 16:05.831
I have the audition...
of my life in a few days.

16:05.867 --> 16:09.535
Okay? I don't have time to rehash this.

16:09.570 --> 16:12.404
I know, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to stress you out.

16:18.746 --> 16:21.680
Okay, well, do what you have to.

16:21.716 --> 16:22.781
- We're fine.
- Okay.

16:22.817 --> 16:24.850
- Bye, Mason.
- Bye, Brandon.

16:28.589 --> 16:31.624
- Hi. Everything okay?
- Yeah. (Sighs)

16:33.761 --> 16:35.861
- Except, um...
- Except?

16:37.498 --> 16:40.399
... my dad knows about
us. Cort told him.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.469
- Why?
- It doesn't matter.

16:43.504 --> 16:44.770
No, it's just...

16:45.806 --> 16:47.873
- explains a lot.
- About what?

16:47.909 --> 16:50.442
- It's fine. I gotta go.
- What?

16:52.480 --> 16:54.100
What did you do?

16:54.101 --> 16:56.688
The robot was working before
you went cheese-holing.

16:56.784 --> 16:59.585
What, you mean before I made us
eligible and saved the day? Again.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.621
Oh, you call making complete
fools of ourselves saving the day?

17:02.717 --> 17:05.584
Guys! It's probably just a loose wire.

17:05.618 --> 17:08.654
- Great! There's like 50 wires!
- Jesus: Okay, I don't need this.

17:08.689 --> 17:11.490
- Mariana: Fine! Well, we don't need you.
- Yes, we do.

17:11.525 --> 17:14.425
We need both of you. We've got
10 minutes until the next round,

17:14.462 --> 17:16.762
so let's start checking wires. Now.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.532
I need a second.

17:21.569 --> 17:23.435
Emcee: We're resetting the
field for the next round.

17:23.471 --> 17:25.503
- Don't go too far.
- Miss Thing.

17:25.539 --> 17:28.741
- A moment, please.
- There's no time.

17:33.444 --> 17:36.378
Honey, is this really how you
want to lead, with an iron fist?

17:36.414 --> 17:39.615
The whole point of this is to
work together and solve problems.

17:39.650 --> 17:42.451
Okay, this is exactly why I
didn't want my mom to come.

17:42.486 --> 17:45.387
I'm not here as your mom. I'm
here as your vice principal.

17:45.423 --> 17:46.855
Well, you're talking to me like my mom,

17:46.891 --> 17:49.625
which is stressing me out even
more than I'm already stressed out,

17:49.660 --> 17:51.694
because we just wasted our first round,

17:51.729 --> 17:53.705
and I've got minutes to make up for that

17:53.706 --> 17:55.506
pathetic performance that we just did.

17:55.599 --> 17:56.832
So either leave or leave me alone.

18:03.274 --> 18:06.570
Excuse me. Hi, do you have a moment?

18:07.919 --> 18:10.720
We're... we're looking into
the murder of Martha Johnson.

18:11.756 --> 18:12.956
Didn't they already
catch the kid who did it?

18:13.992 --> 18:16.593
And aren't you a
little young to be cops?

18:16.628 --> 18:20.697
Sorry. I work for an organization
called the Juvenile Justice Center.

18:20.732 --> 18:24.934
Yeah, we believe that the
kid who was convicted...

18:24.970 --> 18:27.670
Well, he didn't do it, and the
real killer's still out there.

18:27.706 --> 18:30.640
Well, I didn't know
Martha all that well.

18:30.675 --> 18:33.710
My husband and I had just
moved here when it happened.

18:33.745 --> 18:35.311
It was all so awful.

18:35.347 --> 18:37.209
Is there any chance you remember

18:37.210 --> 18:39.760
anyone unusual hanging
around at the time?

18:40.018 --> 18:42.885
Someone who seemed sketchy,
like they didn't belong here?

18:42.921 --> 18:44.954
No, not that I can think of,

18:44.990 --> 18:48.725
but it was a long time ago, so...

18:48.760 --> 18:53.896
In the detectives' notes, they wrote
down something about a curb painter

18:53.932 --> 18:56.799
knocking on doors.
Does that ring a bell?

18:56.835 --> 18:59.869
- It doesn't. I'm sorry.
- Okay. Thank you.

19:04.676 --> 19:07.710
So, let's say we find this curb painter

19:07.746 --> 19:09.746
or some other weird dude
who was in the neighborhood.

19:10.915 --> 19:13.683
What's the plan? Just
walk up to them and ask,

19:13.718 --> 19:16.719
"Hey, by any chance, did you
kill an old lady four years ago?"

19:16.755 --> 19:19.756
No, but maybe... we can
prove that the police

19:19.791 --> 19:22.692
never followed up on any leads that
could've led to another suspect.

19:22.761 --> 19:26.796
You know? Or we could
find someone who had...

19:26.831 --> 19:29.632
a record and maybe a motive.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.601
Couldn't that create reasonable doubt?

19:31.636 --> 19:32.672
It could.

19:32.673 --> 19:35.563
And would that be enough to
get the JJC to take his case?

19:35.707 --> 19:38.041
- It would help.
- (cell phone ringing)

19:40.879 --> 19:44.714
- You can take it.
- No, it's fine.

19:44.749 --> 19:48.017
- Trouble in paradise?
- Oh, there's always trouble when I'm involved.

19:48.053 --> 19:49.752
(knocks)

19:53.058 --> 19:54.924
Okay, we'd better have fixed this.

19:54.959 --> 19:56.926
I will not be humiliated again.

19:56.961 --> 19:59.762
Hey, you're not the only
one on the team, you know.

19:59.798 --> 20:01.831
Emcee: ... 'cause round
two begins in three minutes.

20:01.866 --> 20:03.733
Look at her giving us the stink eye.

20:05.737 --> 20:08.838
I bet they hate not being the only
all-girl team behind the glass.

20:08.873 --> 20:10.673
Yeah, well, they go
to an all-girl school,

20:10.709 --> 20:13.676
- so it's not like they had to earn it.
- Oh no, she's coming over here.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.044
Let the bitch-fest begin.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.681
Hey. I just wanted to wish you luck

20:18.717 --> 20:21.117
and say it's so great to see
another all-girl drive team.

20:22.787 --> 20:25.121
- Thanks.
- Yeah, good luck, too.

20:25.156 --> 20:27.023
Well, bye.

20:30.929 --> 20:32.962
She seems... nice.

20:32.997 --> 20:35.932
- Lovely.
- Don't be fooled.

20:37.836 --> 20:38.935
I've just never seen her act like this.

20:38.970 --> 20:40.136
Stef on phone: <i>Yeah,
well, like you said,</i>

20:40.171 --> 20:41.771
<i>she's got a lot to prove, you know?</i>

20:41.806 --> 20:43.072
No, it's more than that. (Sighs)

20:43.108 --> 20:45.742
She jumped into this right
after the whole Nick thing.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.076
<i>Maybe this is too much
for her to handle.</i>

20:47.112 --> 20:49.679
Well, after today, she won't
have to worry about robotics,

20:49.714 --> 20:52.081
and that'll be a lot of stress
taken off of her, you know?

20:52.117 --> 20:54.851
<i>- That's true.</i>
- I'm glad you're there.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.854
(scoffs) She's not. It's a
good thing we all didn't come.

20:57.889 --> 20:59.956
<i>Yeah, well, do me a favor and keep
me updated on what's going on.</i>

20:59.991 --> 21:02.625
I will. Where are you?

21:02.660 --> 21:04.727
I just... I'm running some errands.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.690
- (buzzer blares)
- Okay, well,

21:06.691 --> 21:08.191
the next round's about
to start. I've gotta go.

21:08.232 --> 21:09.098
I'll call you later. I love you.

21:09.134 --> 21:10.933
Okay, I love you too.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.137
(on voice mail) <i>Hey,
Stef, it's Hank from Vice.</i>

21:14.172 --> 21:17.039
<i>So, it looks like the charges
against Molloy were dropped</i>

21:17.075 --> 21:19.675
<i>because the victim
turned out to be 18.</i>

21:19.711 --> 21:21.744
<i>If you wanna check him
out, it's Benjamin Torres,</i>

21:21.780 --> 21:24.714
<i>636 Everwood, apartment three.</i>

21:24.749 --> 21:26.015
- (beeps)
- (sighs)

21:37.929 --> 21:39.095
Hi, is Benjamin here?

21:48.106 --> 21:50.907
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, are you Benjamin?

21:50.942 --> 21:54.010
- Who are you?
- My name is Stef Adams Foster.

21:54.045 --> 21:55.778
I'm a police officer.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.113
I wanted to know if
you'd be willing to talk

21:57.148 --> 21:59.081
to me about a man named Patrick Molloy.

22:13.932 --> 22:17.767
- What's this about?
- You filed a complaint about him four years ago,

22:17.802 --> 22:20.870
and I was just wondering
why... why you withdrew it.

22:20.905 --> 22:22.972
If you're police, you know why.

22:24.709 --> 22:25.908
How old are you, Benjamin?

22:25.944 --> 22:27.043
18.

22:27.078 --> 22:30.046
18. So you were... you
were 14 back then, right?

22:32.750 --> 22:34.116
Look, Patrick Molloy, he's a bad guy

22:34.152 --> 22:36.018
and he preys on kids.

22:36.054 --> 22:39.088
I'm trying to put him away, okay,
but I'm gonna need your help.

22:40.725 --> 22:42.658
(sighs)

22:42.694 --> 22:44.126
I... I can't help you.

22:44.162 --> 22:46.062
Why not?

22:47.765 --> 22:50.099
Did someone try to... get
you to change your mind,

22:50.134 --> 22:53.736
get you to change your story,
or... like a cop or a detective?

22:54.772 --> 22:56.873
I know you're scared,
you know? I get it.

22:58.076 --> 23:00.877
But I really don't think
that you want this guy doing

23:00.912 --> 23:02.879
to other kids what he did to you.

23:02.914 --> 23:06.849
Hey, and you can trust me.
I promise, you really can.

23:10.788 --> 23:13.089
It was a detective. He said...

23:13.124 --> 23:16.759
(sighs) he'd have my parents deported.

23:18.796 --> 23:20.096
Okay.

23:20.131 --> 23:21.764
Do you remember his name?

23:23.902 --> 23:25.968
Was it... was it Detective Gray?

23:31.042 --> 23:32.041
Okay.

23:32.076 --> 23:34.911
It's not an "8." It's a "B."

23:34.946 --> 23:37.647
And I didn't want my curb
painted in the first place,

23:37.682 --> 23:40.716
but what these guys do is,
they leave a flier in your door,

23:40.752 --> 23:44.120
"Check this box if you don't
want your curb painted tomorrow."

23:44.155 --> 23:47.123
It's a total scam. So, naturally,
I forget to check the box,

23:47.158 --> 23:49.025
and he paints, and
the next thing I know,

23:49.060 --> 23:52.061
I've got a guy on my doorstep
demanding money from me.

23:52.096 --> 23:55.665
Real jackass, too. He was
very aggressive about it.

23:55.700 --> 23:56.866
Callie: And this was
right around the time

23:56.901 --> 23:58.000
that Martha Johnson was murdered?

23:58.036 --> 23:59.902
Same week, as far as I can remember.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.482
I told the cops about it, but they said

24:02.483 --> 24:03.772
that they already got
the guy who killed her,

24:03.775 --> 24:04.774
so I didn't think much of it.

24:04.809 --> 24:06.909
Do you remember anything else about him?

24:06.945 --> 24:10.046
Was there a company name on that flier?

24:10.481 --> 24:14.083
No... But I can tell you where he lives.

24:17.452 --> 24:20.881
Lords and ladies, let FIRST Stronghold,

24:20.900 --> 24:24.602
round two commence! The
drivers behind the line!

24:24.637 --> 24:28.740
- And three, two, one. Charge!
- (buzzer)

24:29.843 --> 24:31.809
Please move, please move, please move.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.811
(beeps, whirring)

24:33.847 --> 24:35.613
- Oh, thank God.
- (cheering)

24:35.648 --> 24:37.715
- Yes!
- (laughs)

24:37.751 --> 24:40.618
Emcee: Round two, and there's
Anchor Beach roaring back to life.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.787
- Looks like they had an autonomous program after all.
- (giggling)

24:42.822 --> 24:46.591
Brant Country Day wasting no time
in clearing that wall obstacle.

24:46.626 --> 24:48.659
(buzzer)

24:48.695 --> 24:52.430
Time for tele-op. Anchor Beach
is making up for lost time.

24:52.465 --> 24:54.899
Oh, they've got Culver City
pinned under their tower.

24:56.536 --> 24:57.769
- (cheering)
- Basket, Anchor Beach!

24:57.804 --> 24:59.704
(laughter)

24:59.739 --> 25:01.639
- (buzzer)
- (rock music playing)

25:02.809 --> 25:04.442
Emcee: Round four.

25:04.477 --> 25:06.711
That first-round malfunction
is a distant memory

25:06.746 --> 25:08.646
for Anchor Beach, who's on a roll.

25:08.681 --> 25:11.382
(shouting)

25:14.521 --> 25:16.721
Ouch! Code Orange has Foshay pinned!

25:16.756 --> 25:19.424
Remember, if you hit a bot
for more than five seconds,

25:19.459 --> 25:21.859
it'll mean a point's deduction
at the end of the round.

25:23.563 --> 25:26.631
Brant Country Day handles
the drawbridge with ease.

25:26.666 --> 25:28.866
- They've really come on strong this competition.
- Woo-oo-oo!

25:30.670 --> 25:31.869
(mouths)

25:31.905 --> 25:35.573
Round eight, another obstacle
cleared for Anchor Beach.

25:35.608 --> 25:38.543
It may not look pretty,
but that robot can move.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.715
(shouting)

25:44.751 --> 25:46.417
Emcee: Milken's putting on a show

25:46.453 --> 25:48.453
- at the opposite end of the field.
- Shoot.

25:49.589 --> 25:50.888
Emcee: Anchor Beach scores again!

25:50.924 --> 25:53.591
One more round like this, and
they're a lock for the top six

25:53.626 --> 25:54.826
and a spot in the finals!

25:54.861 --> 25:56.661
Round nine, commence!

25:56.696 --> 25:59.797
- Three, two, one. Charge!
- (buzzer)

25:59.833 --> 26:01.466
This is it, folks.

26:01.501 --> 26:03.568
Our last round of regular competition.

26:06.840 --> 26:09.674
Da Vinci Academy makes
quick work of that obstacle.

26:09.709 --> 26:13.411
And down by the tower, Anchor Beach
puts itself in position to shoot.

26:15.715 --> 26:18.416
- What are they doing?
- Hey, what the hell?

26:18.451 --> 26:20.651
Emcee: And they're pinned
by the Brant Country Day bot.

26:20.687 --> 26:21.752
Hey, come on, they're holding us

26:21.788 --> 26:23.387
for way more than the five seconds.

26:23.423 --> 26:26.024
Hey, ref, come on! That's
at least a yellow card!

26:26.030 --> 26:27.396
- I knew it. I knew
it.- Emcee: Uh-oh,

26:27.397 --> 26:29.316
- I knew that they were cheaters.
- those girls won't let Anchor Beach go.

26:29.795 --> 26:32.697
Hey, ref! What, are you
blind? Open your eyes!

26:32.732 --> 26:34.765
That's not gracious
professionalism, Mariana.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.567
You're gonna get us disqualified.

26:36.603 --> 26:38.703
Emcee: This could spell disaster
for the Anchor Beach comeback kids.

26:38.738 --> 26:40.538
(buzzer)

26:46.613 --> 26:49.680
(sighs) Dilapidated house
with a jungle out front.

26:50.884 --> 26:51.883
This has got to be it.

27:03.429 --> 27:04.529
(doorbell rings)

27:05.798 --> 27:07.532
So, we're just gonna ask him

27:07.567 --> 27:09.667
if he painted Mrs. Johnson's
curb four years ago.

27:09.702 --> 27:11.602
Yeah, and see how he reacts.

27:11.638 --> 27:14.539
Well, what if he reacts... poorly?

27:14.574 --> 27:16.574
Well, there's two of us and
hopefully only one of him.

27:19.479 --> 27:22.580
Well, looks like he's
not home, so let's go.

27:27.554 --> 27:28.686
Callie: Doug Harvey.

27:35.762 --> 27:37.662
- Where are you going?
- Just taking a look.

27:43.503 --> 27:45.636
(barking)

27:48.541 --> 27:50.808
Craig: Win or lose,
guys, hell of a showing.

27:50.843 --> 27:52.810
Yeah, not counting that last round.

27:53.846 --> 27:55.479
How did the refs not call that?

27:55.515 --> 27:57.782
I swear, if we don't
make it into the finals,

27:57.817 --> 27:59.717
I'm going to smash someone in the face.

27:59.752 --> 28:02.553
Emcee: Lords and ladies, may
I have your attention please?

28:02.589 --> 28:05.389
- The tournament results are in...
- (phone beeps)

28:05.425 --> 28:07.525
- ... and here are the current standings
- _

28:07.560 --> 28:09.493
going into the championship round.

28:09.529 --> 28:11.462
In first place...

28:12.565 --> 28:14.765
Palomar Academy, the PROGrammers.

28:14.801 --> 28:16.567
(crowd cheering)

28:16.603 --> 28:18.569
Yeah! All right! Yeah!

28:18.605 --> 28:20.471
- Emcee: In second place...
- No surprise there.

28:20.506 --> 28:22.740
... Brant Country Day, Baby Got Bots.

28:24.877 --> 28:28.813
Third place, Hamilton High
school, the Da Vinci Coders.

28:28.848 --> 28:32.550
And fourth, High Tech LA,

28:32.585 --> 28:34.518
Team 4 ELEMENT.

28:34.554 --> 28:38.623
In fifth place, Linda Vista
High School, the Lab Brats.

28:40.660 --> 28:42.693
And rounding out the top six...

28:43.796 --> 28:45.596
An...

28:45.632 --> 28:47.798
... drews Prep, Code Orange!

28:49.602 --> 28:51.469
And now for the rest of the results.

28:51.504 --> 28:54.805
Seventh place goes to the Foshay
Learning Center, the Wolverines.

28:54.841 --> 28:57.842
Eighth place, Anchor
Beach Community Charter,

28:57.877 --> 29:00.611
- Anchor Bytes.
- Hey, eighth place.

29:00.647 --> 29:02.513
That's the best finish
in school history.

29:02.548 --> 29:06.684
- Emcee: Tenth place, Culver City, Bagel Bytes.
- Hey, not bad. Seriously.

29:08.821 --> 29:10.421
For a girl.

29:13.493 --> 29:14.434
Oh, no. What is she doing?

29:14.435 --> 29:16.400
- Maybe you should...
- Maybe you should.

29:16.529 --> 29:17.795
I think we all should.

29:18.831 --> 29:20.498
Hey.

29:20.533 --> 29:22.466
You need to pick us as your alliance.

29:22.502 --> 29:25.770
This is the finals, and you didn't
even make it into the top six.

29:25.805 --> 29:27.838
Because you pinned us for
longer than five seconds

29:27.874 --> 29:29.640
- and got away with it.
- Sorry.

29:29.676 --> 29:31.742
You don't have to pick a
team that's in the top six.

29:31.778 --> 29:33.644
It's tradition, but it's not a rule.

29:33.680 --> 29:34.918
And we've got a hanging arm,

29:34.919 --> 29:36.900
which you need to beat Palomar Alliance.

29:36.983 --> 29:38.482
Mariana.

29:42.622 --> 29:44.388
- Okay, deal.
- Great.

29:45.458 --> 29:47.425
There's just one problem.

29:48.561 --> 29:50.628
- Our arm doesn't work.
- Wait. Are you kidding me?

29:50.663 --> 29:52.863
But here's the thing: Palomar
doesn't think it works.

29:52.899 --> 29:56.801
- Because it doesn't.
- Exactly. It doesn't work,

29:56.836 --> 30:00.471
but we've got a whole hour to
change that and blindside them.

30:00.506 --> 30:01.505
One hour.

30:02.608 --> 30:03.708
What if we can't fix it in time?

30:03.743 --> 30:05.676
If we put all of our heads together,

30:05.712 --> 30:07.678
and we "cooperitate,"

30:07.714 --> 30:09.447
maybe we can.

30:09.482 --> 30:11.749
It's the only way you're
gonna win, and you know it.

30:11.784 --> 30:14.618
Let's show everyone
what a group of girls...

30:14.654 --> 30:15.786
Hey.

30:15.822 --> 30:18.889
... and a couple of boys can do.

30:19.926 --> 30:21.525
What do you say?

30:27.654 --> 30:29.621
(core playing)

30:34.761 --> 30:36.627
You never remember to eat
when you're practicing.

30:36.863 --> 30:38.563
(chuckles) Thanks.

30:40.133 --> 30:42.701
You sure you don't want us to drive
you to the airport tomorrow morning?

30:42.736 --> 30:44.803
- 'Cause we can if you...
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

30:44.838 --> 30:46.838
I... I think that'll
just make me more nervous.

30:49.877 --> 30:53.612
So, how are you feeling? Are you ready?

30:53.647 --> 30:55.981
If I tell you the truth, will you
promise not to say, "I told you so"?

31:00.554 --> 31:03.522
Uh, I shall do my best. How's that?

31:04.858 --> 31:08.627
Okay, well, I... I think that I'm...

31:09.763 --> 31:12.731
not as ready as I should
be. I... I think I've...

31:13.901 --> 31:15.700
Well, I've been kind
of distracted, I guess.

31:15.736 --> 31:18.603
Okay. And I think that...

31:18.639 --> 31:21.873
(sighs) that I might
have contributed to that.

31:23.777 --> 31:24.776
Little bit.

31:26.780 --> 31:28.914
I never meant to throw you
out the door, B. I didn't.

31:28.949 --> 31:33.552
And... and... and I know that
you are not solely to blame

31:33.587 --> 31:35.787
for what happened with Callie.

31:35.822 --> 31:38.590
Okay? I am sorry that I said that.

31:40.827 --> 31:42.694
I'm really sorry, too, Mom.

31:43.830 --> 31:47.799
I... I miss you. I do, B, and...

31:49.937 --> 31:52.637
I just... I would love if you came home.

31:53.840 --> 31:54.940
I... I can't leave...

31:56.009 --> 31:57.542
Cort and Mason.

31:57.578 --> 32:00.512
Okay, what happens if
you do get into Juilliard?

32:00.547 --> 32:02.547
Well... then it's different, though.

32:02.583 --> 32:04.549
Then I have to go.

32:04.585 --> 32:05.884
Please promise me, B...

32:07.688 --> 32:09.921
that you will not hold
back on this audition

32:09.957 --> 32:13.792
because you feel that you have
an obligation to this girl.

32:13.827 --> 32:16.728
I want to go to Juilliard
more than anything.

32:18.932 --> 32:19.965
So, I promise.

32:21.802 --> 32:22.767
Okay.

32:25.973 --> 32:28.940
Well, you are welcome
to stay again tonight.

32:28.976 --> 32:31.743
Practice as long as you want, hon.

32:31.778 --> 32:33.545
- Thanks.
- Yup.

32:48.862 --> 32:49.995
Eat your sandwich.

33:00.340 --> 33:03.775
So, besides the fact that we're
staking out a potential murderer...

33:04.911 --> 33:07.979
should I be worried that
you're a magnet for trouble?

33:10.017 --> 33:11.549
Probably.

33:12.886 --> 33:15.654
So... been to juvie twice?

33:16.690 --> 33:17.656
Yeah.

33:18.759 --> 33:19.758
What'd you do?

33:21.662 --> 33:24.929
I smashed up a car with a baseball bat,

33:24.965 --> 33:27.866
and the other time was for running away.

33:30.003 --> 33:31.636
That scare you?

33:32.773 --> 33:34.806
No. I'm sure you had your reasons.

33:37.878 --> 33:40.812
I guess, but I definitely...

33:40.847 --> 33:43.548
made some bad choices.

33:43.583 --> 33:45.950
Yeah, but... that doesn't
mean you're a bad person.

33:45.986 --> 33:49.788
- (chuckles) How would you know?
- I know.

33:54.061 --> 33:55.727
Hey.

34:01.735 --> 34:02.934
- (brakes squeak)
- (engine stops)

34:02.969 --> 34:04.903
(truck door opens, closes)

34:12.946 --> 34:15.746
(keys jingle)

34:17.617 --> 34:18.817
What do you think?

34:23.724 --> 34:27.525
I think we should leave the
detectiving to the real detectives.

34:30.664 --> 34:31.763
(engine starts)

34:34.668 --> 34:36.900
- (rock music playing)
- (people chattering)

34:39.606 --> 34:40.905
So, we spread the word.

34:40.940 --> 34:43.742
Okay, are we sure that
this is the right strategy?

34:43.777 --> 34:46.010
I mean, telling everybody our arm works?

34:46.045 --> 34:49.614
It's done. We just have to
hope that they fall for it.

34:50.851 --> 34:52.650
All right, group huddle.

34:55.054 --> 34:58.957
- What's our motto?
- All: Bitches get things done! Whoo!

34:58.992 --> 35:03.561
- Go, bot bitches! Woo-hoo!
- Who's that?

35:03.630 --> 35:06.765
Um, that's just our vice principal.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.634
Emcee: Let the championship round begin

35:09.669 --> 35:10.935
with drivers behind the line.

35:10.971 --> 35:12.537
- Good luck. Let's go.
- (sighs)

35:12.572 --> 35:13.805
Sasha: Let's do this.

35:15.942 --> 35:17.809
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Woo-hoo!

35:17.844 --> 35:22.580
- Three, two, one. Charge!
- (buzzer)

35:22.616 --> 35:24.783
- Anchor Beach moves down the field.
- Bot coming up on your left.

35:24.818 --> 35:26.718
Thanks. I'm about to score.

35:26.753 --> 35:28.686
- Emcee: Brant Country Day shoots and scores!
- Nice.

35:28.722 --> 35:31.790
Grab that boulder. Guys, we gotta
make every shot here count, okay?

35:31.825 --> 35:34.626
Block Brant. They are killing us.

35:34.661 --> 35:35.994
30 seconds. No one's covering us.

35:36.029 --> 35:37.996
They're all over Brant and High Tech LA.

35:38.031 --> 35:40.532
I guess they didn't believe
that we fixed the arm.

35:40.567 --> 35:42.934
Boy: It's hang time. Shouldn't we stop
Anchor Bytes from taking the tower?

35:42.969 --> 35:45.003
Their arm doesn't work.
They haven't used it all day.

35:45.038 --> 35:47.839
No, they fixed it. Look,
they're heading toward the tower.

35:47.874 --> 35:49.674
Hey, cover... cover the Anchor Bytes.

35:49.709 --> 35:51.843
- Don't let them come back to the tower.
- Palomar's coming.

35:51.878 --> 35:53.912
- Damn it, they believed us.
- What do we do?

35:53.947 --> 35:56.681
- Hey, what are they doing?
- They're retreating.

35:56.716 --> 35:59.784
Duh! Why are they retreating?

35:59.820 --> 36:00.819
20 seconds.

36:00.854 --> 36:02.720
Where did you hear that
they fixed their arm?

36:02.756 --> 36:04.622
Umm... from them.

36:04.658 --> 36:06.758
If they fixed their arm,
are they gonna tell everyone?

36:06.793 --> 36:09.828
Ignore that. Ignore that.
Don't cover Anchor Beach.

36:09.863 --> 36:13.531
You focus on Brant. Hey,
focus on High Tech LA.

36:13.567 --> 36:15.767
It's working, go! 15 seconds!

36:15.802 --> 36:17.535
I'm going as fast as I can.

36:17.571 --> 36:19.571
- Boy: They're coming back for...
- Shush, shush, shush.

36:19.606 --> 36:21.573
- Pin Brant!
- But if we don't do anything...

36:21.608 --> 36:24.676
No! Listen to me! Stay the
course, guys. Don't fall for that.

36:24.711 --> 36:25.877
Emcee: Linda Vista
heads off to defend Brant

36:25.912 --> 36:27.846
as the red alliance starts to
take an insurmountable lead!

36:27.881 --> 36:30.915
- So, the arm works?
- Uh... we'll see.

36:30.951 --> 36:33.618
- Fingers crossed.
- Toes and eyes.

36:35.755 --> 36:38.656
- Emcee: But wait, Anchor Beach is heading back to the tower?
- No, no, no. Bring it back.

36:38.692 --> 36:40.625
Bring... bring it back to this tower!

36:40.660 --> 36:41.759
Stop Anchor Beach!

36:43.663 --> 36:44.963
All we have to do is attach.

36:44.998 --> 36:46.865
Emcee: Palomar is heading back
to try to stop Anchor Beach...

36:46.900 --> 36:49.601
- Now lift.
- ... but it's too late! Their arm is attached!

36:51.638 --> 36:52.904
- Five seconds.
- Emcee: Now it's just a matter

36:52.939 --> 36:55.573
of pulling up to score
the 15-point bonus.

36:55.609 --> 36:57.775
- Can they do it in time?
- Three...

36:57.811 --> 37:00.845
- two...
- (buzzer)

37:00.881 --> 37:02.547
- (cheering)
- Emcee: Anchor Beach did it!

37:02.582 --> 37:04.949
The blue alliance wins! For
the first time in four years,

37:04.985 --> 37:07.619
we have a new champion,
Southern California.

37:07.654 --> 37:08.887
Brant Country Day, Anchor Beach,

37:08.922 --> 37:11.556
and High Tech LA came from defeat

37:11.591 --> 37:13.725
- with a dramatic last-second win!
- I can't believe we did it.

37:14.728 --> 37:16.326
So, the strategy that we used

37:16.332 --> 37:18.965
was to tell everybody
that the arm worked.

37:19.001 --> 37:21.335
- Uh, because it did?
- Duh! We didn't lie.

37:21.370 --> 37:23.103
Gracious professionalism, you know?

37:23.138 --> 37:26.273
Anyway, we knew that no one would
believe us, because girl team, right?

37:26.308 --> 37:30.177
And it worked. Well, at first
it didn't, but then it did.

37:30.212 --> 37:33.980
Oh my God, you should've seen the
look on those Palomar engineers' faces

37:34.016 --> 37:36.817
when our robot lifted itself.

37:37.252 --> 37:40.053
Whatever. It would've made sense
if you'd actually bothered to come.

37:40.089 --> 37:41.321
- (phone rings)
- You told us not to come.

37:41.357 --> 37:43.423
- Um, you should've known better.
- (phone beeps)

37:43.459 --> 37:46.293
Anyway, you can see us at Worlds.

37:46.328 --> 37:51.131
That is if we can raise the $5,000
entrance fee in less than three weeks.

37:51.166 --> 37:54.401
Sweetheart, maybe you
should pass on Worlds.

37:54.436 --> 37:57.003
What? Why would I do that?

37:57.039 --> 37:59.206
Because you've got a
lot going on, you know,

37:59.241 --> 38:02.943
and your grades junior year are
very key at getting into college.

38:02.978 --> 38:04.978
Worlds would look great
on a college application.

38:05.013 --> 38:06.913
Honey, you haven't even
studied for your SATs yet.

38:07.823 --> 38:09.890
I know. I got this. I can do it all.

38:09.925 --> 38:12.226
Well, maybe you should
let some of us help.

38:12.261 --> 38:15.095
I mean, seems like that's your problem.

38:15.130 --> 38:17.898
- You try to do everything.
- That's not true.

38:17.933 --> 38:18.932
I delegate.

38:20.102 --> 38:21.235
Hey, I saw that.

38:22.871 --> 38:26.006
- Who was that?
- It was our realtor.

38:27.176 --> 38:28.842
We have an offer on the house.

38:31.280 --> 38:34.181
Al... already? They
haven't even put a sign up.

38:34.216 --> 38:36.950
Stef: Well, apparently,
she showed it this morning

38:36.986 --> 38:38.952
and the couple who saw
it want to make an offer.

38:38.988 --> 38:43.023
All cash, 10% above the asking price.

38:43.058 --> 38:46.927
That's good. It's, uh... we
could use the extra money.

38:46.962 --> 38:49.162
Yeah, the other news is...

38:49.198 --> 38:50.998
they want a 10-day escrow...

38:52.301 --> 38:55.168
and we'll have to be out
by the end of the month.

39:05.114 --> 39:06.213
(piano music playing)

39:26.969 --> 39:30.037
Sorry. I just wanted to wish you luck.

39:30.072 --> 39:33.974
Oh. That's okay. I'm... I'm done anyway.

39:34.009 --> 39:37.077
I gotta get home and pack.

39:37.112 --> 39:41.114
- So, Cortney's is home?
- Oh, well, I mean, I don't know.

39:41.150 --> 39:45.085
But... this won't be home anymore, so...

39:45.120 --> 39:46.820
(folk music playing)

39:46.855 --> 39:48.955
Hey, what did you mean today,

39:48.991 --> 39:52.125
by the way, when you said,
"This explains a lot"?

39:52.161 --> 39:54.895
Oh, umm, it's your dad.

39:54.930 --> 39:57.097
I don't think he wants me dating AJ.

39:57.132 --> 39:58.265
Because of us?

39:59.301 --> 40:00.867
No, because of me.

40:00.903 --> 40:04.104
- Well... no, don't let him...
- I'm not. (Clears throat)

40:04.139 --> 40:06.006
I'm just tired.

40:06.041 --> 40:07.140
Of what?

40:08.243 --> 40:10.043
People making me feel wrong.

40:10.079 --> 40:12.245
<i>♪ Cut back your deals another day ♪</i>

40:12.281 --> 40:13.880
Good.

40:13.916 --> 40:16.249
Anyway, good luck tomorrow.

40:17.853 --> 40:20.020
I'm really happy for
you. This is your dream.

40:20.055 --> 40:23.156
<i>♪ There's a price to

40:24.193 --> 40:25.258
I'm scared.

40:27.996 --> 40:29.196
You're gonna kill it.

40:30.866 --> 40:32.999
(cell phone rings)

40:33.035 --> 40:35.202
- Sorry, I have to take this.
- Yeah.

40:36.271 --> 40:39.206
Hey. (Clears throat) No, nothing.

40:39.241 --> 40:43.143

y, are we sure that
this is the right strategy?

34:43.777 --> 34:46.010
I mean, telling everybody our arm works?

34:46.045 --> 34:49.614
It's done. We just have to
hope that they fall for it.

34:50.851 --> 34:52.650
All right, group huddle.

34:55.054 --> 34:58.957
- What's our motto?
- All: Bitches get things done! Whoo!

34:58.992 --> 35:03.561
- Go, bot bitches! Woo-hoo!
- Who's that?

35:03.630 --> 35:06.765
Um, that's just our vice principal.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.634
Emcee: Let the championship round begin

35:09.669 --> 35:10.935
with drivers behind the line.

- Good luck. Let's go.
- (sighs)

35:12.572 --> 35:13.805
Sasha: Let's do this.

35:15.942 --> 35:17.809
- Here we go. Here we go.
- Woo-hoo!

35:17.844 --> 35:22.580
- Three, two, one. Charge!
- (buzzer)

35:22.616 --> 35:24.783
- Anchor Beach moves down the field.
- Bot coming up on your left.

35:24.818 --> 35:26.718
Thanks. I'm about to score.

35:26.753 --> 35:28.686
- Emcee: Brant Country Day shoots and scores!
- Nice.

35:28.722 --> 35:31.790
Grab that boulder. Guys, we gotta
make every shot here count, okay?

35:31.825 --> 35:34.626
Block Brant. They are killing us.

35:34.661 --> 35:35.994
30 seconds. No one's covering us.

35:36.029 --> 35:37.996
They're all over Brant and High Tech LA.

35:38.031 --> 35:40.532
I guess they didn't believe
that we fixed the arm.

35:40.567 --> 35:42.934
Boy: It's hang time. Shouldn't we stop
Anchor Bytes from taking the tower?

35:42.969 --> 35:45.003
Their arm doesn't work.
They haven't used it all day.

35:45.038 --> 35:47.839
No, they fixed it. Look,
they're heading toward the tower.

35:47.874 --> 35:49.674
Hey, cover... cover the Anchor Bytes.

35:49.709 --> 35:51.843
- Don't let them come back to the tower.
- Palomar's coming.

35:51.878 --> 35:53.912
- Damn it, they believed us.
- What do we do?

35:53.947 --> 35:56.681
- Hey, what are they doing?
- They're retreating.

35:56.716 --> 35:59.784
Duh! Why are they retreating?

35:59.820 --> 36:00.819
20 seconds.

36:00.854 --> 36:02.720
Where did you hear that
they fixed their arm?

36:02.756 --> 36:04.622
Umm... from them.

36:04.658 --> 36:06.758
If they fixed their arm,
are they gonna tell everyone?

36:06.793 --> 36:09.828
Ignore that. Ignore that.
Don't cover Anchor Beach.

36:09.863 --> 36:13.531
You focus on Brant. Hey,
focus on High Tech LA.

36:13.567 --> 36:15.767
It's working, go! 15 seconds!

36:15.802 --> 36:17.535
I'm going as fast as I can.

36:17.571 --> 36:19.571
- Boy: They're coming back for...
- Shush, shush, shush.

36:19.606 --> 36:21.573
- Pin Brant!
- But if we don't do anything...

36:21.608 --> 36:24.676
No! Listen to me! Stay the
course, guys. Don't fall for that.

36:24.711 --> 36:25.877

- Emcee: But wait, Anchor Beach is heading back to the tower?
- No, no, no. Bring it back.

36:38.692 --> 36:40.625
Bring... bring it back to this tower!

36:40.660 --> 36:41.759
Stop Anchor Beach!

36:43.663 --> 36:44.963
All we have to do is attach.

36:44.998 --> 36:46.865
Emcee: Palomar is heading back
to try to stop Anchor Beach...

36:46.900 --> 36:49.601
- Now lift.
- ... but it's too late! Their arm is attached!

36:51.638 --> 36:52.904

37:02.582 --> 37:04.949

37:43.459 --> 37:46.293
Anyway, you can see us at Worlds.

37:46.328 --> 37:51.131
That is if we can raise the $5,000
entrance fee in less than three weeks.

37:51.166 --> 37:54.401
Sweetheart, maybe you
should pass on Worlds.

37:54.436 --> 37:57.003
What? Why would I do that?

37:57.039 --> 37:59.206

Hey, I saw that.

38:22.871 --> 38:26.006

That's good. It's, uh... we
could use the extra money.

38:46.962 --> 38:49.162
Yeah, the other news is...

38:49.198 --> 38:50.998
they want a 10-day escrow...

38:52.301 --> 38:55.168
and we'll have to be out
by the end of the month.

39:26.969 --> 39:30.037
Sorry. I just wanted to wish you luck.

39:30.072 --> 39:33.974
Oh. That's okay. I'm... I'm done anyway.

39:34.009 --> 39:37.077
I gotta get home and pack.

39:37.112 --> 39:41.114

"This explains a lot"?

39:52.161 --> 39:54.895

39:57.132 --> 39:58.265
Because of us?

39:59.301 --> 40:00.867

40:00.903 --> 40:04.104

40:06.041 --> 40:07.140

40:08.243 --> 40:10.043
