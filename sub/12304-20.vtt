WEBVTT

01:40.100 --> 01:40.900
Cut!

01:47.000 --> 01:47.600
Are you good?

01:48.000 --> 01:48.800
Uh, yeah, I'm good.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.200
I'm good. Thanks.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.400
That was hot! Yeah!
Rod!

01:51.435 --> 01:52.600
- Thank you.
- Rod!

01:53.000 --> 01:53.900
What happened?

01:54.200 --> 01:55.000
Woo!
What the hell?

01:55.400 --> 01:56.065
Shot's ruined.

01:56.100 --> 01:57.100
Who popped the trunk?

01:57.600 --> 01:58.365
Wasn't me.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.900
Must've been open
before we rolled.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.900
Talk to transport.

02:01.100 --> 02:02.300
Hey, come quick!

02:02.335 --> 02:02.865
What is it?

02:02.900 --> 02:04.100
You got to see this.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
What's going on?

02:10.400 --> 02:11.500
Oh, my God.

02:12.000 --> 02:12.900
It's Brody.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.800
Somebody call an ambulance!

02:20.800 --> 02:23.300
I'm live on the scene
where actor Brody Lassiter

02:23.335 --> 02:25.400
was found dead
of his latest movie

02:25.500 --> 02:26.165
<i>Full Tilt.</i>

02:26.200 --> 02:28.500
The body of movie star
Brody Lassiter was discovered

02:28.535 --> 02:30.465
while filming a dangerous
high-speed car chase

02:30.500 --> 02:32.265
this morning... No information
has been released yet

02:32.300 --> 02:35.700
on how Lassiter died or even
if he was part of the stunt.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.400
No, he wasn't part
of the stunt.

02:37.435 --> 02:38.300
It's too dangerous.

02:38.335 --> 02:39.400
Apparently so.

02:40.500 --> 02:41.600
How'd he end up in there?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.900
People don't just put themselves
in trunks.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.200
I have no idea.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.100
Why don't you guys do
whatever cops do

02:47.135 --> 02:47.665
and find out.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.100
'Cause your stunt crew
destroyed my crime scene.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.900
If you're saying we tried
to cover something up,

02:53.935 --> 02:55.200
extinguishers are protocol.

02:55.900 --> 02:56.365
You were in charge

02:56.400 --> 02:57.700
of the car, weren't you?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.800
Yeah, checked everything
last night after the dry run.

03:01.900 --> 03:04.900
Locked it up before I left.
Apparently not well enough.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.000
Look...

03:08.300 --> 03:09.300
I'm sorry.

03:09.600 --> 03:10.600
I've just been doing this
so long.

03:10.635 --> 03:11.900
It's always been fake.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.700
I keep thinking
Brody's gonna be okay.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.800
Well, he's not going to
walk away from this one.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.400
And neither...
will his killer.

03:30.300 --> 03:36.300
- CSI MIAMI S05E20-
"RUSH"

04:27.100 --> 04:28.200
All right, careful.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.000
Careful, let's do this right.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.000
Going to be plenty of eyes
watching this one.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.200
Was Mr. Lassiter
working this morning?

04:42.800 --> 04:44.050
Well, that's
what's so weird.

04:44.085 --> 04:45.300
His call time
wasn't till noon.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.600
How about last night?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.200
No, Brody wraps at 6:00 sharp.

04:49.700 --> 04:50.900
Every 15 minutes we go over,

04:50.935 --> 04:52.000
costs us 20 grand.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.965
His contract

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
had a lot of rules.

04:55.300 --> 04:56.400
Rules.

04:57.300 --> 04:59.065
His wardrobe had
to be organic cotton.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.400
Fresh pomegranate juice
every morning, no pulp.

05:02.100 --> 05:02.565
Let's just say,

05:02.600 --> 05:04.400
a lot of people wanted him
off the movie.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.365
Hold up, hold up,
hold up.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.300
Where you going with that?
Is that for Brody? Excuse me.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.300
Can I help you?

05:10.900 --> 05:11.750
Yeah, I'm Eddie Corbett.

05:11.785 --> 05:12.600
I'm in charge of Brody.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.400
Gentlemen,
continue, please.

05:15.700 --> 05:16.500
Thank you,
ma'am.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.165
Mr. Corbett,

05:18.200 --> 05:19.100
what can I do for you?

05:20.600 --> 05:22.200
His family's on their way down
from Pennsylvania

05:22.235 --> 05:23.400
and they want a funeral.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.900
And they're going
to get a funeral.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.100
Not for a few days.

05:27.300 --> 05:28.465
I know how these things work.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.700
Then you understand that
we do have jurisdiction

05:30.735 --> 05:32.900
over the body. You're
gonna cut him up now, right?

05:33.500 --> 05:34.600
What am I going to tell
his family?

05:34.635 --> 05:35.717
They want an open casket.

05:35.752 --> 05:36.765
I'm sure his
family wants me

05:36.800 --> 05:38.800
to find out who did
this, don't they?

05:42.300 --> 05:43.665
This is my fault.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.200
I should've been watching him.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.700
What did you do for Brody?

05:51.000 --> 05:51.900
Babysit.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.800
Brody's been known to party.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.350
This movie's huge
for the studio.

05:57.385 --> 05:59.100
They already greenlit
two sequels.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.600
They paid me to get him
to work in one piece.

06:03.300 --> 06:04.400
Guess I failed.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.700
How long did you know him?

06:09.400 --> 06:10.300
Grew up together.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.300
I'm sorry for your loss.

06:16.700 --> 06:17.400
Look...

06:18.000 --> 06:20.500
it's no secret that Brody
could be difficult sometimes.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.800
But he didn't deserve to die
like this.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.000
Mr. Corbett,

06:24.900 --> 06:25.900
no one does.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.000
Brody Lassiter, I
don't believe it.

06:35.700 --> 06:36.800
You're a fan?

06:37.100 --> 06:38.950
<i>I only sawBlitzed
three times.</i>

06:38.985 --> 06:40.800
It's that whole
bad boy thing.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.100
I guess I like it.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.500
Any idea what
killed him?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.865
Well, won't know much

06:45.900 --> 06:48.500
until I get this
flame-retardant powder off him.

06:49.900 --> 06:52.400
Honey, what
is in that trunk?

06:52.435 --> 06:54.900
Because baby boy is glowing.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.400
What does it look like?

06:57.300 --> 06:58.100
Well...

06:58.800 --> 07:00.065
Antifreeze is this color,

07:00.100 --> 07:01.900
but no one's gonna
use that in Miami,

07:01.935 --> 07:03.700
and it definitely
doesn't glow.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.200
Wait a minute.

07:07.100 --> 07:07.900
I got it.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.400
It's a broken glow stick.

07:11.100 --> 07:12.000
It's got to be fresh

07:12.035 --> 07:12.900
if it's still working.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.900
Maybe they used it
in the stunt.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.300
I don't think so.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.100
Says it's from
a nightclub.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.250
There are no tool marks
on the trunk

07:20.285 --> 07:22.000
and the lock hasn't
been tampered with.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.100
So no one broke in.

07:24.300 --> 07:26.300
And the stunt guy had
the only key.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.300
Stunt guy is lying.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.000
Someone must've stolen it
last night after wrap.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.265
The steering column
was intact

07:35.300 --> 07:36.700
and you're the only
one with the key.

07:36.735 --> 07:37.800
So, why don't
you try again.

07:40.000 --> 07:40.800
Okay.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.200
I took the car out.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.500
Me and Brody
went clubbing in it.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.800
So, what happened?
You and Brody

07:51.835 --> 07:53.000
have too much drink,
get in a fight?

07:53.200 --> 07:54.000
No, no way.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.700
Brody was stone-cold sober.

07:56.300 --> 07:58.300
That's the good part about going
out with a guy in rehab.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.000
Brody Lassiter was in rehab?

08:00.300 --> 08:02.800
Yeah, inpatient
with work privileges.

08:02.835 --> 08:03.600
Where've you been?

08:05.500 --> 08:07.300
So, Brody snuck out
last night.

08:08.000 --> 08:08.900
Yeah.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.100
Sweet for me-

08:10.700 --> 08:12.500
a designated driver
who's a movie star.

08:13.100 --> 08:13.765
I could get hammered

08:13.800 --> 08:15.400
and get into every club
in the city.

08:15.435 --> 08:16.617
Why don't you get
to the part

08:16.652 --> 08:17.800
where Brody ends
up in the trunk.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.300
Believe me, I have no idea.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.100
He was fine when I dropped him
off at White Sands.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.265
White Sands, that's the, uh,

08:24.300 --> 08:26.300
that's the rehab center
for the rich and famous?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.200
After he went inside,

08:28.900 --> 08:29.765
I was too wasted to drive,

08:29.800 --> 08:32.000
so, I thought I'd sleep it off
a little bit in the parking lot.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.299
Yeah. Oh!

08:38.799 --> 08:40.765
Damn, dude,
the way you drive,

08:40.799 --> 08:42.200
you should be doing
your own stunts.

08:42.235 --> 08:43.500
Nah, too many
pads and helmets.

08:43.534 --> 08:44.300
This is more fun.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.600
Oh, man.

08:45.800 --> 08:46.800
I think
I'm going to hurl.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.000
See you later, Rod.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.000
When I woke up,
it was an hour to call time.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.600
So I left.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.400
Why didn't you say
anything before?

08:56.700 --> 08:58.000
I took a production car.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.900
It wasn't even insured.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.165
I could lose my stunt
accreditation.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.300
Oh, I think you can lose
a lot more than that.

09:05.300 --> 09:06.400
Look, I told you,

09:06.900 --> 09:08.500
I had nothing to do
with Brody dying.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.100
We're going to hold you
for a little while

09:10.135 --> 09:11.100
just to make sure of that.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.300
I don't trust you actors.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.200
I'm a stunt guy.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.000
Whatever.

09:34.200 --> 09:34.800
Hi.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.400
Brody didn't die
in the car, Ryan.

09:37.700 --> 09:38.400
What do you mean?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
He has a ligature
mark on his neck.

09:41.035 --> 09:42.400
The mark's at an angle,

09:42.500 --> 09:44.200
above the laryngeal
prominence.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.200
And that's consistent
with a hanging.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.500
It was suicide.

09:53.300 --> 09:53.900
No.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.300
Look at the laceration
on his neck.

09:58.100 --> 09:59.600
He tried
to pull the rope off.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.600
That's right.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.265
And you don't typically

10:02.300 --> 10:04.950
find marks like these
in a true suicide.

10:04.985 --> 10:07.600
Only do that if you
don't want to die.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.050
Okay, so explain to me
how you hang

10:13.085 --> 10:14.700
a 170-pound guy
against his will?

10:15.300 --> 10:16.400
Didn't someone
hear him screaming?

10:16.600 --> 10:17.565
It's rehab.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.800
Everyone's screaming.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.900
You ever seen someone
go through detox?

10:22.200 --> 10:24.000
See, that reminds me,
I gotta get over there,

10:24.600 --> 10:25.900
but thank you, Alex.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.200
I knew you could do it.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.400
Do what, honey?

10:28.800 --> 10:30.700
Get me probable cause
for a warrant.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.300
You are wasting
your time, gentlemen.

10:47.300 --> 10:49.800
White Sands...
saved Brody's life.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.400
He couldn't have been
killed here.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.000
Trust me. This is a safe place.

10:54.100 --> 10:56.000
Well, we looked into the
history of this place.

10:56.035 --> 10:58.600
It's, um...
it's not that safe.

10:58.635 --> 10:59.600
What do you mean by that?

10:59.700 --> 11:01.700
Two people died
here, Mr. Ashford.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.000
Those were suicides.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.700
We've made changes since then.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.700
Define changes, please.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.200
When a patient checks in,

11:14.700 --> 11:16.800
we confiscate anything
that could be used as a weapon.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.300
Please remove your shoes,
Mr. Lassiter.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.700
I'm also going to need
your belt, your cell phone.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.900
Do you have any sharp objects
on your person?

11:24.100 --> 11:24.800
No.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.000
I don't know if I
can do this, man.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.900
I know it doesn't seem likit
right now...

11:33.800 --> 11:34.700
it gets easier.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.700
Now,
you have any problems,

11:37.800 --> 11:40.700
you come to me
personally... okay?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.200
Thanks.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.700
And look around.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.500
Glasses are plastic,

11:51.400 --> 11:52.465
not even a butter knife.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.600
I think we're gonna look
a little harder than that.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.300
What's this?

11:56.700 --> 11:58.300
That is a search warrant.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.500
Oh, no. You're not gonna
turn this place into a circus.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.850
These people pay
a lot of money

12:02.885 --> 12:03.965
to protect their
confidentiality.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.800
Relax. We're only looking
into Brody Lassiter's room.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.200
Fine.

12:08.700 --> 12:09.800
You won't find anything.

12:09.835 --> 12:10.900
I guess time will tell.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.300
Yeah, got it.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.500
The noose?

12:19.800 --> 12:21.300
No, where the
rope was hung.

12:21.335 --> 12:22.400
There's a...

12:23.600 --> 12:24.800
There's a groove in the wood.

12:27.100 --> 12:28.800
So this is definitely
where Brody died.

12:28.900 --> 12:30.400
So much for
being the, uh...

12:31.500 --> 12:33.500
safest place in
Miami, you know?

12:33.800 --> 12:35.365
Yeah, well, Ashford was right
about one thing.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.400
There's nothing in this room
that can be used like a noose.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.600
I found something.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.100
Yeah? What's that?

12:50.700 --> 12:51.865
It's a hair.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.000
Black, but it's too long
to be Brody's.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.900
Bet you it's female.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.500
Well, yeah.

12:58.000 --> 12:58.965
He's a big star.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.300
Probably had his pick
of any of the girls in here.

13:05.800 --> 13:06.800
Hey, Natalia.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.200
Yeah? The walls of the bathroom

13:08.235 --> 13:09.500
aren't painted
green, are they?

13:09.800 --> 13:10.600
No.

13:10.700 --> 13:11.365
'Cause there's a mark

13:11.400 --> 13:12.900
on this shelf that's green.

13:12.935 --> 13:14.000
And it looks like...

13:15.300 --> 13:17.200
Looks like somebody had
wet paint on their fingers.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.600
There are green pots outside.
Did you see those?

13:26.800 --> 13:28.300
Yeah, the ones
lining the walkway.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.100
Somebody had to have
painted them.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.300
Yeah, I painted the pots.

13:36.500 --> 13:39.400
Anything I can do to stay away
from all those celebutantes.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.400
So it sounds like
it's a common practice

13:41.435 --> 13:43.200
for the patients
to tend the grounds.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.200
It's part of
their treatment plan.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.965
Doing manual labor's
supposed to get you

13:47.000 --> 13:50.800
in touch with your inner self,
or some Zen BS like that.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.300
You're up at White Sands
under court order.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.765
This pansy judge

14:02.800 --> 14:04.800
spun a tale
that I'm a violent drunk.

14:04.835 --> 14:06.600
But I'm not like those brats.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.200
I don't belong there.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.300
I would agree.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.900
I think you belong in jail.

14:11.700 --> 14:14.100
What were you doing
in Brody Lassiter's room?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.800
So this third degree
is about Mr. Hollywood?

14:18.500 --> 14:18.865
I thought you guys

14:18.900 --> 14:20.900
found his body
on some movie set.

14:20.935 --> 14:22.900
We also found your paint
in his room.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.500
These kids get any drug
they want smuggled in there.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.300
Rumor was he was hiding vodka
in his water bottle.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.000
So a couple
days ago,

14:35.035 --> 14:36.000
I went looking.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.400
Look, Lieutenant,

14:51.200 --> 14:52.500
you can't pin
this on me.

14:53.300 --> 14:54.300
I know this game.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.800
I've been
in the hot seat before.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.900
Then get comfortable.

15:14.600 --> 15:17.400
So I heard that Natalia
didn't get a hit with CODIS

15:17.435 --> 15:19.500
on the black hair
we found in Brody's room.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.800
That is true,
but that might be

15:21.835 --> 15:22.365
of some help.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.100
Turns out,
it's not really black.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.800
It's dyed.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.100
That's pretty great.

15:30.135 --> 15:30.800
It's a lead.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.000
Well, in theory.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.100
Right. White Sands
isn't gonna give us a list

15:34.135 --> 15:35.800
of their patients
with dyed hair.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.000
Medical confidentiality
even covers murder.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.800
It's a good thing
it doesn't cover gossip.

15:40.835 --> 15:41.700
Come with me.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.300
It's a guilty pleasure.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.100
Have not read it yet,
but Holly Reese is on the cover.

15:53.135 --> 15:54.300
She just went into rehab.

15:54.500 --> 15:54.965
Is that right?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.400
I thought she was
the one celebrity

15:56.435 --> 15:57.765
with a good reputation.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.900
I know. So much for
the bubble gum image, right?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.400
And her blonde hair-
look at that.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.700
Yeah, used to be
blonde. Exactly.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.100
Wow.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.300
All right.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.000
Looks like Brody's helping her
through her addiction.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.265
White Sands is known
for its privacy,

16:15.300 --> 16:17.600
but that photo was taken
inside Brody's room, wasn't it?

16:20.200 --> 16:21.700
Well, how'd the paparazzi
get in there?

16:21.900 --> 16:22.765
I don't know.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.365
Why don't you go there,

16:23.400 --> 16:24.800
and I'm gonna go
talk to Holly.

16:24.835 --> 16:25.400
That sounds good.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.565
Sorry for dragging
you out here.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.000
It's just... never know
who's taking notes inside.

16:35.100 --> 16:36.200
Paparazzi's
everywhere.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.000
Yeah, I read the article

16:38.035 --> 16:39.200
<i>inTelltale.</i>

16:39.300 --> 16:41.000
So I just want to ask you
a few questions.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.600
Does this mean I'm a suspect?

16:43.300 --> 16:45.600
Or just one of those
persons of interest?

16:45.900 --> 16:46.765
Well, it really just depends on

16:46.800 --> 16:48.900
how you explain what you were
doing in Brody's room.

16:48.935 --> 16:50.500
We have evidence
that puts you there.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.300
Am I in trouble?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.200
Oh, my God,you're gonna arrest me.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.800
Okay, quick, just do it
before someone sees me.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.850
No, uh, Miss Reese,
you can turn around.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.600
I'm just here to ask you
a few questions.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.100
I just want to know what you
were doing in Brody's room.

17:03.135 --> 17:03.700
Um...

17:06.700 --> 17:07.599
Well...

17:07.800 --> 17:08.849
It's hard to have fun
in this place

17:08.885 --> 17:09.900
without your cell phone,
you know?

17:10.300 --> 17:11.200
So, um,

17:11.800 --> 17:12.700
we have sex.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.700
Beats therapy.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.500
Oh, I feel cured.

17:16.800 --> 17:17.400
How about you?

17:20.700 --> 17:21.599
Wasn't serious.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.599
Okay, did you
see him last night?

17:25.200 --> 17:25.800
No.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.500
I was "hallway monitor"
last night.

17:28.700 --> 17:30.300
Sucked.
Really?

17:30.400 --> 17:32.400
Did you see something,
someone, anything unusual?

17:33.400 --> 17:34.350
Well, no.

17:34.385 --> 17:35.300
I, uh...

17:35.700 --> 17:37.100
Truth is, I passed out.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.000
From what?

17:39.035 --> 17:39.900
This is rehab.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.800
Uh, yeah.

17:41.900 --> 17:44.100
Side effect,
from being an addict.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.200
Sometimes I get blackouts.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.800
When you need an alibi?

17:47.900 --> 17:48.700
No.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.700
No, I cared about Brody.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.900
I mean, we started out
just hooking up, but then,

17:55.300 --> 17:56.600
I don't know, he got me.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.300
He understood
the whole

17:59.900 --> 18:02.200
"I want to be normal,
but I'm famous" thing.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.000
I'd never kill him.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.100
I think it's a good thing
that you can't leave.

18:09.100 --> 18:09.900
I know.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.400
This place is like prison.

18:16.300 --> 18:18.200
Trust me, it's nothing
like prison.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.900
Well, we got to figure out
where the photographer was

18:25.935 --> 18:27.667
if we're gonna
figure out who he is,

18:27.702 --> 18:29.400
'cause maybe he snapped
some pictures

18:29.435 --> 18:30.600
the night of the murder.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.565
Well, from the
angle of the shot,

18:33.600 --> 18:35.200
they had to have taken it
through this window.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.300
Yeah, paparazzi
with a telephoto lens.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.800
Maybe they took it
from one of those rooms.

18:47.900 --> 18:49.000
Something's weird.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.700
From that distance, they'd never
get that vantage point.

18:51.735 --> 18:52.500
The angle is...

18:54.100 --> 18:54.665
it's too steep.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.500
Yeah, they would've had
to be closer to the room.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.400
Or in it.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.600
Unbelievable.

19:11.700 --> 19:14.400
Boy, I can't even imagine
the things this camera's seen.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.200
That's the camera
from Brody's room?

19:17.400 --> 19:20.000
Yeah. Unfortunately, it's
only pointed at the bed.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.700
Since the murder happened
in the main room,

19:21.800 --> 19:23.200
we don't get to
see the killing.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.200
But there is
one interesting thing.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.900
The bedspread.

19:28.935 --> 19:29.765
Exactly.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.400
It was never in
any crime scene photos.

19:31.435 --> 19:33.100
Okay, continue, please.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.100
Wait a minute.

19:37.600 --> 19:38.700
There's somebody there.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.000
But his face is never on screen.

19:42.300 --> 19:43.300
Wait a minute.

19:43.400 --> 19:44.300
Right there.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.665
The ring.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.400
Yes, in its reflection.

19:49.600 --> 19:50.900
Let me resolve that image.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.400
Is that the head of the clinic?

19:54.435 --> 19:55.900
Not for long.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.600
Taking out the trash?

20:02.100 --> 20:04.300
Bag on the table
and step away from it.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.300
Clients aren't the only ones
who do chores around here.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.000
We like to set a good example.

20:11.300 --> 20:12.300
You can't
touch that.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.400
Your warrant
only covers Brody's room.

20:14.435 --> 20:16.000
The warrant has been amended.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.065
Gave up your rights

20:18.100 --> 20:20.700
once you compromised
your patients, Mr. Ashford.

20:20.735 --> 20:22.065
Put cameras
in those rooms,

20:22.100 --> 20:24.200
you took pictures, and you
sold them to the tabloids.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.000
So much for privacy.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.900
Look, you've got to understand.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.500
White Sands does not advertise.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.100
Good publicity is how we keep these rooms full.

20:35.135 --> 20:37.300
How a little invasion of privacy...

20:37.335 --> 20:38.800
and they love the exposure.

20:40.100 --> 20:40.900
H.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.300
Looks like we found our noose.

20:46.600 --> 20:47.865
Mr. Ashford, you adjusted

20:47.900 --> 20:50.300
that camera angle to cover
the murder, didn't you?

20:50.335 --> 20:51.000
No.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.500
I didn't kill Brody.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.500
I found him hanging there
this morning.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.500
<i>I moved the camera</i>

21:06.600 --> 21:08.500
<i>so it didn't catch me
moving his body.</i>

21:22.000 --> 21:24.100
Lieutenant, suicides are bad
for my business.

21:24.135 --> 21:25.100
So is murder.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.800
So if you didn't
stringim up, who did?

21:30.500 --> 21:31.300
I don't know.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.400
But there are plenty of people
who had cause.

21:34.700 --> 21:35.500
Why?

21:36.400 --> 21:38.200
Yesterday, Brody reached
Level 6.

21:38.800 --> 21:39.700
Confessions.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.100
Basically, you make
good with your past.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.600
Apologize to everyone
you've wronged.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.200
Our suspect pool
just got bigger.

21:47.235 --> 21:48.700
So that means
I'm off the hook.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.000
No, not exactly.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.400
You're an accessory to murder.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.500
Get ready for Level 6.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.400
So who did Brody
confess to?

22:06.700 --> 22:08.050
All the patients at White Sands,

22:08.085 --> 22:09.365
they have to share
three landlines,

22:09.400 --> 22:11.300
and Brody had access
to one of those phones

22:11.335 --> 22:12.800
last night from 7:00 to 9:00.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.665
I traced
all the calls he made.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.900
Almost everyone he confessed to
lives out of state.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.200
The locals check out, too,
so it's a dead end.

22:19.300 --> 22:20.900
Maybe the confession
wasn't over.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.300
How we gonna know
who he was going to call?

22:23.335 --> 22:24.600
We go back to the clinic.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.800
The administration
will just keep stonewalling us.

22:26.835 --> 22:28.000
Talk to the patients.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.100
At least you still have a mom.

22:41.135 --> 22:41.900
Hey, hey, hey!

22:42.700 --> 22:43.700
No cross-talking.

22:45.300 --> 22:46.700
You can finish that thought
tomorrow.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.800
Okay, that's it
for today, everyone.

22:49.835 --> 22:50.465
Let's go.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.100
Hey, guys, listen, uh,
before you all take off,

22:54.135 --> 22:56.200
I'm Eric Delko, MDPD.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.065
I'm just looking
for a little help

22:58.100 --> 22:59.900
with a few questions
about Brody Lassiter.

22:59.935 --> 23:00.700
Let's go.

23:01.300 --> 23:02.600
Just information, guys.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.100
No one's in any kind of trouble.

23:09.800 --> 23:10.265
I was wondering

23:10.300 --> 23:12.000
when someone was going
to ask about Brody,

23:13.200 --> 23:15.100
but I don't think we're
legally allowed to talk.

23:16.300 --> 23:17.000
Well, what's your name?

23:17.500 --> 23:18.400
Jolene.

23:18.700 --> 23:19.500
Jolene.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.165
It's okay.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.665
It's just the employees here

23:22.700 --> 23:24.200
who are bound
by confidentiality.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.500
Well, I really shouldn't
say anything anyway.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.800
Brody was hanged
last night.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.600
Any help I can get
in solving this murder,

23:32.635 --> 23:33.400
I appreciate it.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.300
Okay, but we only talked,
like, four or five times.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.000
All right. Well,
what do you think you know?

23:43.900 --> 23:46.750
Well, this one time
we were partnered up.

23:46.785 --> 23:49.600
Sort of role-playing
before we hit Level 6.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.400
The confessions?
Yeah.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.100
And he confessed something.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.400
Oh, this is really
hard for me.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.400
Just say it, Brody.

24:00.200 --> 24:01.000
Let it out.

24:02.700 --> 24:03.600
I killed someone.

24:04.900 --> 24:05.700
What?!

24:06.200 --> 24:07.300
You killed someone?

24:09.600 --> 24:12.800
I'm not sure if it was real,
but he did say that.

24:14.100 --> 24:15.200
Thank you, Jolene.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.000
You know, you're really brave.

24:18.900 --> 24:20.800
Why? For telling you?

24:20.835 --> 24:22.700
No. For being here.

24:36.300 --> 24:39.700
Tripp, look, I've got a girl
here who says that

24:39.900 --> 24:41.700
Lassiter confessed
to killing somebody.

24:41.735 --> 24:42.700
Any idea who?

24:43.400 --> 24:44.600
She doesn't
know that part.

24:45.100 --> 24:45.765
So, look,
we've got to go

24:45.800 --> 24:48.300
through Brody's entire
history for unexplained deaths,

24:48.600 --> 24:49.365
anything.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.800
I think I know where to start.

24:57.600 --> 25:00.500
Eddie, you told me that you
and Brody grew up together.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.500
That's right.

25:02.700 --> 25:03.900
Raised on the same block.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.000
Maybe shared some
of the same instincts.

25:07.100 --> 25:08.100
What's that supposed to mean?

25:08.300 --> 25:10.800
Look, Eddie, we know
Brody killed someone.

25:11.700 --> 25:12.265
What?!

25:12.300 --> 25:13.900
You're his best friend.
You knew that.

25:14.100 --> 25:14.700
Maybe you
helped him

25:14.735 --> 25:15.500
clean it up.

25:18.400 --> 25:19.200
No way.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.800
Found out you used to have a job
in waste management.

25:21.835 --> 25:22.900
That was high school, man.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.400
All right, let's try something
a little more recent.

25:26.200 --> 25:26.765
Angie Paulson

25:26.800 --> 25:29.250
was doing a comedy with Brody
when she disappeared.

25:29.285 --> 25:31.700
Never showed up on the set,
never heard from again.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.400
That girl was crazy.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.965
She went all Buddhist.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.500
Moved to Tibet or something.

25:38.700 --> 25:39.750
According to
her family,

25:39.785 --> 25:40.800
she's still a missing person.

25:41.100 --> 25:41.965
And if you
helped Brody

25:42.000 --> 25:44.600
dispose of Angie's body,
that ties you in.

25:47.300 --> 25:49.500
Look, man, I didn't do anything.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.600
Everybody's done
something, Eddie.

25:59.900 --> 26:01.150
That's the noose
Delko found

26:01.185 --> 26:02.400
in the clinic
director's trash?

26:02.700 --> 26:05.200
Yeah. Guess what
I found on it?

26:05.235 --> 26:06.000
What?

26:06.400 --> 26:08.600
Mass spec says
that it's heroin.

26:14.300 --> 26:17.100
The tabloid said Holly Reese
was admitted for heroin.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.065
She could have relapsed.

26:19.100 --> 26:20.565
She did say
she blacked out.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.000
Yeah, but the clinic's
never going

26:22.035 --> 26:23.400
to let us look at her records.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.900
That's true,
but weave her hair.

27:02.800 --> 27:05.600
Looks like Holly hasn't
done any heroin recently.

27:07.900 --> 27:08.265
You know what?

27:08.300 --> 27:09.900
In fact, she's never done
any at all.

27:11.000 --> 27:11.800
What do you mean?

27:11.900 --> 27:13.000
Her hair is crystal-clean.

27:13.035 --> 27:13.565
There's no heroin.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.000
There's no drugs.
There's nothing.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.600
So she lied
about being an addict.

27:19.900 --> 27:20.465
I don't know.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.700
Everybody wants out of rehab.

27:21.735 --> 27:25.700
Why does she want in?

27:27.200 --> 27:29.700
See what star was arrested
at rehab today.

27:43.100 --> 27:43.665
Hey, Holly.

27:43.700 --> 27:44.800
It's Calleigh Duquesne.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.400
Hey. Have a seat.

27:51.400 --> 27:52.200
Thank you.

27:52.300 --> 27:55.700
Front page of the tabloids and
breaking news all in one week.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.200
And that's good?

27:57.400 --> 27:59.300
Oh, all publicity
is good publicity.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.200
Well, how about
this headline?

28:01.235 --> 28:03.000
"Holly Reese fakes addiction. "

28:04.500 --> 28:05.700
What are you talking about?

28:06.000 --> 28:07.400
I mean, I'm here
to kick heroin.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.700
Holly, hair records drugs
like a timeline.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.900
Your hair is completely clean.

28:23.300 --> 28:24.600
Look, um,

28:25.500 --> 28:27.400
I'm just here
researching for a role.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.065
It's a huge part.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.800
I get to un-glam, and that's how
all the stars get Oscars.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.100
Halle, Nicole, Charlize.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.200
How did you get past
the physical screenings?

28:36.400 --> 28:38.200
Mr. Ashford knows
my situation.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.600
He helped me
get admitted.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.800
Holly, you do realize that he is
the person who sold the pictures

28:42.835 --> 28:44.600
of you and Brody
to the tabloids, don't you?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.100
Hey, he got press,
I got press.

28:47.135 --> 28:48.000
Everyone's happy.

28:48.700 --> 28:50.300
I don't know
that everyone's happy.

28:50.335 --> 28:51.817
Brody Lassiter's representatives

28:51.852 --> 28:53.300
released a statement
to the media

28:53.335 --> 28:54.165
a couple of days ago

28:54.200 --> 28:56.300
saying that the two of you
were never together.

28:57.900 --> 28:58.800
That must have hurt.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.600
Well, yeah.

29:02.700 --> 29:03.165
And so what?

29:03.200 --> 29:05.200
You went into Brody's room
last night,

29:06.000 --> 29:07.100
got all of your anger out?

29:07.800 --> 29:09.265
No, I didn't.

29:09.300 --> 29:10.900
I was on hall duty,
like I told you.

29:10.935 --> 29:12.500
But you also said
that you blacked out,

29:12.535 --> 29:13.700
and clearly, that's a lie.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.350
I just didn't want
to say what I saw.

29:18.385 --> 29:20.500
Well, I'm afraid
now you have no choice.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.050
Fine. It was Jerry,

29:25.085 --> 29:26.900
that criminal guy.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.300
He went into Brody's room
last night.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.300
Jerry went into Brody's room
a lot of nights.

29:43.100 --> 29:46.700
Are you trying to tell me
that Brody Lassiter was gay?

29:47.600 --> 29:49.500
Look, I don't know
for sure, all right?

29:49.535 --> 29:50.800
I mean, he liked girls, too.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.600
I think.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.900
Do you remember about what time
Jerry went into his room?

29:57.000 --> 29:58.700
No. I wasn't
looking at my watch.

29:59.100 --> 30:00.865
God, you're not going
to tell anyone, are you?

30:00.900 --> 30:03.500
I mean, I finally get a picture
in the tabs with an A-lister,

30:03.535 --> 30:05.100
and then it turns out
that he likes guys.

30:05.900 --> 30:08.200
That news doesn't exactly
make me bankable.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.700
<i>Well, I guess all publicity
isnot good publicity.</i>

30:16.300 --> 30:18.065
You said you were in
Brody's room a few days ago,

30:18.100 --> 30:20.200
but we have an eyewitness
that puts you there last night.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.300
You and Brody were
in a relationship,

30:22.335 --> 30:23.100
weren't you?

30:27.300 --> 30:28.100
He's dead,

30:28.200 --> 30:30.200
so you can stop
protecting his reputation.

30:30.900 --> 30:33.100
We found a lot of
his personal items

30:33.135 --> 30:34.000
in your room.

30:37.300 --> 30:38.800
You two think
I'm a fruit.

30:39.600 --> 30:40.700
What were you doing
with his stuff?

30:41.000 --> 30:41.900
Selling it.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.300
Didn't you see how much Justin's
half-eaten piece of pizza

30:45.335 --> 30:46.400
went for on e-Bay?

30:47.200 --> 30:47.965
I saw an opportunity

30:48.000 --> 30:49.500
to make a little extra cash.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.500
So, he found you
stealing his stuff,

30:51.535 --> 30:52.500
and you decided
to kill him?

30:53.000 --> 30:53.800
No.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.500
He wasn't even there.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.000
I had nothing to do
with his murder.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.300
We found heroin on
the murder weapon.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.400
Good for you.

31:03.000 --> 31:03.365
Did you pick up

31:03.400 --> 31:04.800
a new habit in rehab?

31:05.800 --> 31:06.700
No.

31:06.701 --> 31:09.301
Well, then you won't mind proving it later.

31:23.200 --> 31:23.800
Hey.

31:23.900 --> 31:25.700
Jerry tested negative
for heroin.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.300
I don't think
he's our killer.

31:27.335 --> 31:28.500
Yeah, I don't
think so, either.

31:28.535 --> 31:29.265
Why not?

31:29.300 --> 31:30.365
Because the noose that was used

31:30.400 --> 31:32.400
to hang Brody
was made of dental floss.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.200
Dental floss?
Yeah.

31:34.500 --> 31:36.200
How-How is that possible?

31:37.400 --> 31:39.800
<i>Has a tensile strength of up
to 25 pounds per strand.</i>

31:39.835 --> 31:42.200
<i>You braid it together,
it makes it even stronger.</i>

31:42.400 --> 31:43.900
It's even been used
to break out of jail.

31:44.100 --> 31:45.600
Okay, but how does
that rule Jerry out?

31:45.800 --> 31:48.200
Well, based on the
number of strands

31:48.235 --> 31:49.200
and the length
of the rope,

31:49.500 --> 31:50.865
took someone
a long time to make it,

31:50.900 --> 31:52.900
and Jerry's only been
in rehab two weeks.

31:53.100 --> 31:55.000
So, who's been
at White Sands the longest?

32:00.300 --> 32:02.100
You've been a patient
here at White Sands

32:02.135 --> 32:03.917
for almost two months,
which means that

32:03.952 --> 32:05.700
you would have had ample time
to make this.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.000
It was used
to hang Brody Lassiter.

32:09.700 --> 32:10.400
What?

32:15.800 --> 32:17.400
It disappeared from
my room last night.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.700
What were you going
to use the rope for, Jolene?

32:21.000 --> 32:21.900
Nothing, really.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.200
Come on.

32:27.200 --> 32:27.765
You know I'm allowed

32:27.800 --> 32:29.600
to leave White Sands
anytime I want.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.400
I just don't have the guts
to do it.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.300
You were going to kill yourself?

32:51.300 --> 32:52.300
I feel like I...

32:53.500 --> 32:54.800
I might not make it at home.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.200
But you've come so far.

33:00.800 --> 33:01.900
Two months sober.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.000
But in rehab, there's
always someone to talk to.

33:07.300 --> 33:08.700
There's people
watching me.

33:11.100 --> 33:12.500
What am I going to
have in Kansas City?

33:14.500 --> 33:15.500
My journals?

33:16.200 --> 33:17.500
Rehab exercises?

33:20.600 --> 33:22.200
That's not going
to go very far.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.700
But what about your family?

33:25.200 --> 33:27.100
They spent all their money
sending me here.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.500
What if it doesn't work?

33:32.300 --> 33:33.565
I'm going
to let them down again.

33:33.600 --> 33:36.400
No, you're not going
to let them down.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.100
They want to help you.

33:40.800 --> 33:41.600
How do you know?

33:49.300 --> 33:51.300
A couple of months ago,
I got shot.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.300
And I was scared
to come back to work.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.200
You were?

34:02.600 --> 34:03.500
Yeah.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.300
I didn't want to ask
for anybody's help.

34:08.199 --> 34:11.000
I ended up making...
a few mistakes.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.199
But every day
it gets a little better.

34:16.699 --> 34:18.100
And it'll get better
for you, too.

34:21.100 --> 34:23.400
Your friends and family, they
just want to be there for you.

34:26.100 --> 34:27.400
You're gonna be okay, Jolene.

34:30.900 --> 34:32.300
I guess I'll have to be.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.800
Somebody stole my other option.

34:42.000 --> 34:42.800
Hey.

34:42.900 --> 34:43.800
Hey.

34:44.500 --> 34:45.565
So, uh...

34:45.600 --> 34:46.699
so, what's
all this?

34:47.300 --> 34:48.565
They're Brody's journals.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.400
We confiscated them
from Jerry.

34:50.900 --> 34:53.000
Luckily, you got to them
before he put 'em on e-Bay.

34:54.000 --> 34:54.665
What is this?

34:54.699 --> 34:56.100
This looks like
his obituary.

34:56.199 --> 34:57.000
It is.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.700
That's not supposed to
come out till tomorrow.

34:59.900 --> 35:00.465
I know.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.400
This one was written a week ago.

35:03.800 --> 35:04.700
By who?

35:04.800 --> 35:06.600
Well, Brody wrote it
himself.

35:06.635 --> 35:07.865
It's a rehab exercise.

35:07.900 --> 35:09.000
It's supposed to make you
write down

35:09.035 --> 35:10.217
everything you've done
in your life

35:10.252 --> 35:11.365
and the changes
you want to make.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.200
Does it say that he killed
someone in this?

35:13.600 --> 35:15.700
No, but he does make reference
to an "accident. "

35:15.900 --> 35:16.700
Really?

35:17.100 --> 35:18.065
"After the accident,

35:18.100 --> 35:19.900
"Brody Lassiter
got into drugs,

35:20.800 --> 35:22.900
and decided to move to
Miami to be an actor. "

35:23.700 --> 35:26.100
I think he may have moved
to evade charges?

35:26.500 --> 35:27.965
Well, we, uh, looked
into his history.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.300
He doesn't have any warrants
or, uh, wants for him.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.000
Yeah, but an accident's
not a crime.

35:33.200 --> 35:34.165
So, how do you find out

35:34.200 --> 35:35.900
if something happened
to a dead guy?

35:37.400 --> 35:38.300
Go to the source.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.200
So, Calleigh,

35:45.400 --> 35:47.900
I figured out why
no one heard him screaming.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.450
Subdural hematoma.

35:49.485 --> 35:50.700
He hit his head.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.100
Well, that would explain
why he didn't fight back.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.000
What about
any older injury?

35:55.035 --> 35:56.065
Anything like that?

35:56.100 --> 35:58.600
Not on the body,
but inside.

35:59.700 --> 36:00.400
See that?

36:00.500 --> 36:02.400
Right there.
Ribcage?

36:02.800 --> 36:05.100
These are multiple
healed fractures.

36:05.135 --> 36:06.365
When we break bones,

36:06.400 --> 36:08.000
they actually grow back thicker

36:08.035 --> 36:09.367
and stronger than before,

36:09.402 --> 36:10.700
so they show up brighter

36:10.735 --> 36:11.600
on the X-ray.

36:12.100 --> 36:14.000
These are compression fractures.

36:14.200 --> 36:14.900
Meaning?

36:15.000 --> 36:16.500
He was hit
with something

36:16.535 --> 36:17.700
straight on.

36:18.100 --> 36:19.400
This'll show us what.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.900
Whatever it was,
it was round.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.500
It was a car accident.

36:31.700 --> 36:32.365
Well,

36:32.400 --> 36:34.700
if there was a a fatality,
it would have been in the news.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.800
So, what exactly
are we looking for?

36:38.300 --> 36:39.700
We're looking
for fatal car crashes

36:39.735 --> 36:41.100
that occurred
before Brody moved

36:41.135 --> 36:42.600
from Pennsylvania to Miami.

36:42.800 --> 36:43.565
These are all the clips

36:43.600 --> 36:45.300
from local
Williamsport newspapers.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.500
Here's one: "Tragic Accident. "

36:49.600 --> 36:52.000
But the driver was apprehended
at scene and arrested.

36:53.300 --> 36:54.300
Yeah. Moving on.

36:55.700 --> 36:56.400
Oh, here's one.

36:56.700 --> 36:58.400
Nah, that car
was sideswiped.

36:58.600 --> 37:00.400
That wouldn't cause
steering wheel impact.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.200
Okay. Moving on.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.000
Here we go.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.800
"Local girl killed
in grisly crash. "

37:07.835 --> 37:10.200
Ran the car
into a telephone pole,

37:10.235 --> 37:11.300
and the driver
was killed.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.700
Yeah, Brody's X-rays
are showing

37:13.735 --> 37:14.900
that he was the driver.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.000
Okay.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.300
Moving on.

37:19.100 --> 37:19.900
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

37:19.935 --> 37:20.900
Go back a second.

37:21.100 --> 37:22.000
Back... okay.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.400
Look at the name
of the victim.

37:25.900 --> 37:26.900
Diane Corbett.

37:28.500 --> 37:29.200
That's right.

37:29.700 --> 37:30.565
That's the same
last name

37:30.600 --> 37:33.100
as Brody's assistant,
Eddie Corbett.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.100
<i>Then maybe Brodywas there.</i>

37:37.600 --> 37:38.165
Maybe he just moved

37:38.200 --> 37:39.700
Diane's body
into the driver's seat

37:39.735 --> 37:41.200
after the car accident
and took off.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.500
I think we just found our crash.

37:47.900 --> 37:49.100
We found heroin

37:49.600 --> 37:51.000
in your apartment, Eddie.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.000
Personal use.

37:54.700 --> 37:55.465
To take the edge off.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.050
What are you gonna do,
arrest me for it?

37:57.085 --> 37:58.600
No, I'm going to arrest you
for murder.

38:00.500 --> 38:01.200
What?

38:01.500 --> 38:04.000
We found heroin residue
on Brody's noose.

38:04.035 --> 38:05.800
I'm guessing
it's a match to yours.

38:13.300 --> 38:15.900
Brody made a big deal
about me moving out here.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.500
Said he didn't know
who to trust.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.300
Needed his best friend around.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.500
It was all guilt.

38:26.700 --> 38:28.100
Guilty about Diane.

38:28.200 --> 38:28.900
Right?

38:30.200 --> 38:31.000
Yeah.

38:31.800 --> 38:32.965
She was my big sister.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.200
And she died in that
car accident, didn't she?

38:35.800 --> 38:37.600
I didn't even know
Brody was in the car.

38:37.900 --> 38:39.465
I mean, he's supposed
to be my best boy

38:39.500 --> 38:41.500
and he doesn't even tell me
that he was the one driving?

38:41.535 --> 38:42.900
He wanted to tell you, Eddie.

38:45.400 --> 38:46.400
Last night, he...

38:47.400 --> 38:48.165
he called me from the club.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.050
He told me to meet him
at White Sands.

38:50.085 --> 38:51.742
I- I thought he relapsed
or something.

38:51.777 --> 38:53.400
Because he wanted
to confess to you.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.800
Like it was okay now
because he said it out loud.

38:56.700 --> 38:57.865
I'm so sorry, bro.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.300
I wanted to tell you, but...

38:59.900 --> 39:01.000
Then why didn't you?

39:02.300 --> 39:03.365
I was scared.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.500
You killed my sister.

39:04.800 --> 39:05.900
You killed her!

39:15.000 --> 39:16.400
He wasn't breathing.

39:17.100 --> 39:18.565
I didn't mean
for that to happen.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.200
So you decided to make
it look like suicide.

39:23.900 --> 39:25.000
That was the idea.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.150
<i>And I searched in a bunch
of rooms, you know,</i>

39:30.185 --> 39:31.892
<i>for anything
that could've made it seem</i>

39:31.927 --> 39:33.600
<i>like Brody could've done it
himself.</i>

39:36.800 --> 39:38.000
<i>Then I found that rope.</i>

40:04.100 --> 40:05.500
He was still alive.

40:07.300 --> 40:08.000
Yeah.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.765
I freaked. I ran.

40:09.800 --> 40:11.400
Just like he did ten years ago.

40:11.435 --> 40:12.967
No, no, no, no,
it was different.

40:13.002 --> 40:14.951
Yes, it was
different, Eddie.

40:14.986 --> 40:16.900
The difference is
you got caught.

40:17.700 --> 40:18.400
Let's go.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
The paparazzi
is loving this.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.200
Best friends both turn out
to be killers.

41:21.300 --> 41:23.700
This brings the Brody Lassiter
murder investigation

41:23.735 --> 41:24.800
to a close.

41:24.900 --> 41:28.000
Best friend and longtime
assistant Eddie Corbett

41:28.035 --> 41:29.200
has just been arrested.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.265
And in other celebrity news,

41:31.300 --> 41:34.765
<i>Holly Reese's latest project
has been greenlit.</i>

41:34.800 --> 41:38.800
<i>It will focus on one brave young
woman's struggle with addiction.</i>

41:39.000 --> 41:40.565
<i>And speaking of addiction,</i>

41:40.600 --> 41:43.500
<i>pop singer Elvina has
reportedly checked herself</i>

41:43.535 --> 41:44.700
<i>into rehab.</i>

42:33.800 --> 42:35.800
If this is true,i really have to see for it

42:37.000 --> 42:38.400
Some of us more then one.
