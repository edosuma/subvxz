WEBVTT

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:36.503
Stay down!

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.281
Don't move!

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.484
Yeah!

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:59.125
Mayday! Mayday! This
is the Sawyer-Two.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.993
We're under attack by pirates.

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:02.750
Requesting an immediate aid.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.536
They say everybody's
good at something.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.705
Me? I talk to fish.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.610
That's how I met
my friend, Storm.

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:19.045
He's always there
when I need a lift.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.793
Some people think
that makes me a joke.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.595
But I don't care.
You know why?

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:36.467
'Cause I'm also good
at something else.

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.335
And that's breaking heads.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.631
Pow! Papa took on
all the pirates.

00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:53.937
I was like, "Well, the
pirates think that..."

00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:55.582
Hi-ya!

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.069
Papa kicked their butts.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.834
Those chum lickers
didn't stand a chance.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.158
Ooh!

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:08.160
Papa kicked their asses
and took their names.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:10.312
Yeah! Come on!

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:13.969
Watch out.

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:21.508
Sorry, Pops. My bad.

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:24.711
Oh, yeah, this is
my son, Arthur Jr.

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:27.481
See, four years ago,
everything changed.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:31.379
I met a woman, fell in love,
and the next thing I know,

00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:32.924
we're getting married
and having a kid.

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:36.802
This little guy's the best
thing that ever happened to me.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:43.095
But this kid, he doesn't sleep.

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:46.232
What you got in there, huh?

00:02:47.568 --> 00:02:49.201
Okay...

00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:51.936
And he never misses.

00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:53.372
What the...

00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:55.086
And then, I'm up at
the crack of dawn

00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:57.152
because on top of getting
married and having a kid...

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:59.418
I finally got a job.

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.584
That's right. I'm the
king of freaking Atlantis.

00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:08.755
How did I score that, you asked?

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.591
Well, I stopped my brother, Orm,

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:13.359
from attacking
the surface world.

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:15.976
And in doing so, I claimed
the throne from him.

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:18.498
At first I was all like...

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:21.167
Yeah!

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.211
The territorial waters
are long held...

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:24.750
But then, as it turned out,

00:03:24.775 --> 00:03:26.575
being king wasn't all
it was cracked up to be.

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:31.177
It's just meetings
all day and politics.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.288
I'm so bored, I don't even know
which end of the Brine King

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:34.936
I'm supposed to be
looking at half the time.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.851
Whoo!

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.519
Yeah! That was awesome!

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.354
And if that's not bad enough,

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.490
turns out there's this whole
Council of Houses thing

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:45.525
that nobody told me about.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.428
Which basically gets to shoot
down everything I want to do.

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:50.229
The only thing that
makes all the hard work

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:52.933
and sleepless nights worthwhile
is hanging with my little man.

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:54.901
Hey! You missed me!

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.441
But of course, there are
fun parts of the job.

00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:06.278
Whoa!

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:08.312
I get to keep the sea safe
the best way I know how.

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:14.905
Especially when I get to take
down an illegal cage fight or two.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.696
But for everything I get right,

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.631
something else gets screwed up.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:35.742
Ah, fu...

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:46.252
♪ Born to be wild ♪

00:05:01.868 --> 00:05:03.637
- Oh, yeah.
- Here you go.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.342
Slainte.

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.250
So...

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:20.887
he's gonna need a little
brother or sister to play with.

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.027
He's got a dog.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.896
Hey, I'm serious.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.033
I saw how lonely it
was for you growing up.

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:34.534
An only child.

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:39.439
I always regretted I
couldn't give you that.

00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:42.676
Yeah, well, don't be
too hard on yourself.

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:45.311
Turns out I have a brother
and he's a total dick bag.

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:46.780
Come on.

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:50.951
Your relationship with Orm
isn't how it usually is.

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:54.654
Sure, siblings
bicker and fight...

00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:58.290
but at the end of the
day, they're family.

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:01.962
You should be able to
count on them for help.

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:05.565
Yeah, well, I'll still take
the dog over him any day.

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:13.372
Hey, look at that.

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.252
Holy crap.

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:35.061
Hi, baby boy. Are you
talking to the fishies?

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:42.736
Oh, man. Pops, this
is blowing my mind.

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:45.872
My whole life I've wanted to
share this gift with someone.

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:48.842
Yeah, but you and me,
son, we're different.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:51.912
We're special.

00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:54.414
We're connected to
the land and the sea.

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:58.952
I can't wait to introduce you to all
the majestic creatures on our planet.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:02.122
And show you how awesome
this world can be.

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.490
Yeah, you and me.

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:01.848
I cross-referenced the
coordinates from Dr. Shin.

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:03.717
Nothing.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.952
Still no sign of Atlantean
remnants under the ice.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.387
Looks like he's led us on
another wild goose chase.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:28.108
Every day I don't
fix my power suit

00:08:28.141 --> 00:08:30.944
is another day
Aquaman gets to live.

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.117
Check again.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.686
We're close this
time. I can feel it.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.798
Expedition log day 463,
Dr. Stephen Shin recording.

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:55.502
My quest for Atlantis has brought
me to the ends of the earth.

00:08:55.535 --> 00:08:58.471
David Kane is
losing his patience.

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:01.942
If I don't turn up the Atlantean
technology he's looking for soon,

00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:05.211
they're probably
going to... um...

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:08.190
You know what, let's
not even go there.

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:10.817
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

00:09:22.662 --> 00:09:25.131
Dr. Shin, take a look at this.

00:09:25.165 --> 00:09:27.701
Please tell me you
found something.

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.602
Seismic array is going crazy.

00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:30.837
Where's the epicenter?

00:09:31.805 --> 00:09:32.806
We're standing on it.

00:09:56.229 --> 00:09:57.664
Run!

00:10:45.779 --> 00:10:48.281
What just happened?
An earthquake?

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.551
No. I think it was a piece
of ice sheet breaking off.

00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:30.757
Come on. Get up.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.028
- I think I broke my ankle!
- Come on. Let's go!

00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:37.230
Come on, get up. Go, we
gotta go! We gotta go!

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:41.367
Come on, we gotta
move! Come on!

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:05.258
Please, please. No, no!
Help, please! Don't let go!

00:12:36.156 --> 00:12:37.991
What the hell happened to you?

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.428
There's something back there.

00:12:55.476 --> 00:12:58.311
Astounding.

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:00.447
My readings show
something's down here.

00:13:00.481 --> 00:13:03.450
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

00:13:03.484 --> 00:13:07.787
If it is, we might be able to scavenge
the tech you need to fix your suit.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.823
How is this place even possible?

00:13:10.857 --> 00:13:12.134
This was all probably solid ice

00:13:12.158 --> 00:13:15.361
until we started
heating the planet.

00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:18.765
Well, thank God for global
warming, am I right?

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:21.801
Uh, yeah, that's not
exactly a good thing.

00:13:39.352 --> 00:13:41.221
The tracks lead down there.

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:44.924
Suit up.

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:48.861
Wait. The tracks lead
down there, which means...

00:13:48.895 --> 00:13:50.730
the monster's down there.

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:58.338
Okay. I guess we're
going down there.

00:14:22.563 --> 00:14:25.198
I don't believe this.

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:29.936
It's a structure of some kind.

00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:32.573
And there's more
buried in the ice.

00:14:32.606 --> 00:14:35.975
Here I thought we were
just going to find a ship.

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:39.446
- Everyone, fan out and search.
- Yes, sir.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.348
We've stumbled upon
something big here, doc.

00:14:45.852 --> 00:14:48.388
This has to be a few
thousand years old.

00:14:48.422 --> 00:14:50.023
Astounding.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:57.864
Whoa.

00:14:58.632 --> 00:14:59.899
Uh...

00:15:40.474 --> 00:15:41.475
Ow...

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.293
What is this place?

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:06.326
At last, you are here.

00:16:36.563 --> 00:16:39.165
Free me from my prison

00:16:39.198 --> 00:16:42.301
and I will grant
you the strength

00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:46.139
to kill the man who
murdered your father.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:47.940
You can't leave him like this!

00:16:47.974 --> 00:16:49.676
You ask the sea for mercy.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.678
Get out of here!
You need to live

00:16:51.712 --> 00:16:54.347
so you can kill
that son of a bitch!

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.452
You will take from him
what he stole from you.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.524
His home will burn

00:17:03.557 --> 00:17:08.529
and his kingdom will
fall before my legions.

00:17:13.634 --> 00:17:16.335
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.671
David. No, David.

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.372
David! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:17:19.406 --> 00:17:21.675
David. David, it's okay.

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.075
You're all right.

00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.145
What the hell is that thing?

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:42.639
Just unbelievable footage

00:17:42.663 --> 00:17:44.565
coming in from all
around the world.

00:17:44.598 --> 00:17:47.200
Good evening, folks.

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.344
In the past five months, we've seen
an extraordinary rise in temperatures

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:51.572
reported around the world.

00:17:51.605 --> 00:17:55.274
And that has resulted in some of
the wildest weather we've ever seen.

00:17:55.308 --> 00:17:58.745
Yes, this is thundersnow
in Dallas, Texas.

00:17:58.779 --> 00:18:00.590
Visibility is near zero...

00:18:00.614 --> 00:18:02.616
and there's more
snow expected tonight

00:18:02.649 --> 00:18:06.052
than Dallas usually
sees in an entire year.

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:08.789
It's only one part of a
worldwide weather phenomenon

00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:11.425
unlike anything we've
ever seen before.

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:18.432
Arthur.

00:18:21.702 --> 00:18:24.505
The Council's called for
an emergency gathering.

00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:28.107
There's been another
plague outbreak.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.310
Scientists are at
a loss to explain.

00:18:31.344 --> 00:18:33.346
But the real question is,

00:18:33.379 --> 00:18:35.047
how long will it continue?

00:18:35.081 --> 00:18:37.316
And how much hotter
is it going to get?

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:42.623
Where did it hit this time?

00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:44.758
The Ninth Tride of Atlantis,

00:18:44.791 --> 00:18:46.593
and there are now
reports of outbreaks

00:18:46.627 --> 00:18:49.061
in the Fishermen
Kingdom as well.

00:18:49.095 --> 00:18:51.698
There haven't been outbreaks
like this in centuries.

00:18:51.732 --> 00:18:53.734
Why now?

00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:57.169
Increased ocean acidity, decreased
oxygen levels, toxic algal blooms.

00:18:57.203 --> 00:18:59.205
Take your pick.

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:04.545
The surface has been poisoning
our atmosphere for over a century.

00:19:04.578 --> 00:19:06.556
You can't expect them to
care about what happens to us

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.282
if they don't even
know we exist.

00:19:09.315 --> 00:19:10.827
If you want to be a part
of the conversation,

00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:13.252
we have to take our
seat at the table.

00:19:18.525 --> 00:19:21.461
It's time for Atlantis to
reveal itself to the surface.

00:19:25.632 --> 00:19:28.635
Your majesty is well aware of
the Council's position on this.

00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:31.137
Listen, we can talk
to their scientists

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.107
and combine our technologies to reverse
the damage that they've already done.

00:19:35.141 --> 00:19:37.711
And I know this is
against our traditions,

00:19:37.744 --> 00:19:39.446
but the world is shrinking,

00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:41.515
and the old ways aren't
gonna protect us anymore.

00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:44.183
Times have changed.

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:46.787
Atlantis wants this.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.220
There's a whole
generation out there

00:19:48.254 --> 00:19:49.756
that don't want to hide anymore.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.225
Have you already
forgotten that this plague

00:19:53.259 --> 00:19:56.228
killed your own beloved mentor,

00:19:56.262 --> 00:19:59.666
and you want to
negotiate with them?

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.738
We gave your brother war powers and
made him Ocean Master for a reason.

00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:08.842
If we ever decide to make ourselves
known to the surface-dwellers,

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:12.813
it will be to eradicate
them, not to co-exist.

00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:43.309
Hey, not bad.

00:20:45.378 --> 00:20:47.948
Used to take me twice as long
to get you to go to sleep.

00:20:47.981 --> 00:20:49.816
I don't know how
you did it, Pops.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.952
Mera and I have the
whole kingdom helping us,

00:20:51.985 --> 00:20:54.454
but that little baby boy
is still kicking our asses.

00:20:54.488 --> 00:20:56.890
And you...

00:20:56.923 --> 00:21:00.226
taking care of me,
raising me on your own...

00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:06.533
You're the real superhero.

00:21:09.503 --> 00:21:11.672
- To single parents.
- Mmm.

00:21:13.807 --> 00:21:17.276
Well, my job was a little
less stressful than yours.

00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:20.681
Yeah, well, I just
plain suck at my job.

00:21:20.714 --> 00:21:24.383
Vulko told me to bring the
land and the sea together.

00:21:24.418 --> 00:21:28.789
The problem is half of Atlantis
still wants to destroy the surface.

00:21:28.822 --> 00:21:31.290
They won't listen. I
can't bring shit together.

00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:34.393
Vulko believed in you. Aye.

00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:35.662
I know.

00:21:37.898 --> 00:21:39.298
I miss him.

00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:43.470
Hey.

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:48.475
You can't save them all, son.

00:21:48.508 --> 00:21:52.244
You really want to know how
I raised you here by myself?

00:21:53.714 --> 00:21:56.550
I just kept going.

00:21:56.583 --> 00:21:59.820
You celebrate the wins,
you mourn the losses.

00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:02.489
And you wake up the next
day and you do it again.

00:22:02.522 --> 00:22:04.591
Sometimes not giving up

00:22:04.624 --> 00:22:06.960
is the most heroic
thing you can do.

00:23:05.986 --> 00:23:08.522
Humans were not made to
live at these depths.

00:23:09.623 --> 00:23:11.825
Yeah, don't worry about that.

00:23:11.858 --> 00:23:14.694
You just remember
who built this ship.

00:23:14.728 --> 00:23:17.097
I'm more worried about how
long ago they built it.

00:23:18.732 --> 00:23:21.835
We're coming up on it.
Engage stealth mode.

00:23:38.685 --> 00:23:41.421
Hey, doc.

00:23:41.454 --> 00:23:43.723
You stand ready with
that big gun of yours.

00:23:54.034 --> 00:23:57.537
Expedition log, day 613.

00:23:57.571 --> 00:24:00.040
Kane is off on our most
dangerous mission yet.

00:24:00.073 --> 00:24:02.876
A three man octobot
infiltration team.

00:24:06.046 --> 00:24:07.523
It's incredible that these
ancient machines we found

00:24:07.547 --> 00:24:09.783
still function after
all these years.

00:24:09.816 --> 00:24:12.018
All I did was retrofit
them to our needs.

00:24:12.052 --> 00:24:16.156
But they require a very specialized
fuel to keep them running.

00:24:16.189 --> 00:24:18.592
Kane calls it orichalcum.

00:24:18.625 --> 00:24:20.460
I don't know how he
knows about this,

00:24:20.493 --> 00:24:23.029
but it all started the
day he found that trident.

00:24:23.063 --> 00:24:26.032
Suddenly, he knows secrets
that he couldn't possibly know,

00:24:26.066 --> 00:24:28.969
including the only way
to obtain this orichalcum

00:24:29.002 --> 00:24:32.038
is to steal it from
highly-protected storage vaults.

00:24:32.072 --> 00:24:34.841
And we're about to hit the
most dangerous one of them all.

00:25:20.987 --> 00:25:23.490
Okay, you have 15 minutes
to get in and out.

00:25:24.758 --> 00:25:26.526
No margin for error.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.809
Yeah, this should
take you through.

00:25:56.723 --> 00:25:58.525
We don't want any confrontation.

00:25:58.558 --> 00:26:00.961
David, we can't fight
their entire army.

00:26:17.777 --> 00:26:19.913
Stay vigilant.

00:26:19.946 --> 00:26:22.626
We have no idea what kind of security
measures they have down there.

00:26:48.174 --> 00:26:50.744
Commencing extraction.

00:26:50.777 --> 00:26:53.113
Be careful. It's
highly volatile.

00:27:01.054 --> 00:27:02.589
Loading barge now.

00:27:20.373 --> 00:27:23.676
Stingray, change of plans.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:25.278
I need an extraction now!

00:27:25.311 --> 00:27:29.015
All hands to battle stations.

00:28:02.215 --> 00:28:03.683
Astounding.

00:28:08.354 --> 00:28:10.657
Attention, unidentified vessel.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:12.058
You are out of the transit zone.

00:28:12.092 --> 00:28:14.694
Doctor, power up
the sonic battery.

00:28:14.727 --> 00:28:17.831
Illegal border crossing will
be met with deadly force.

00:28:17.864 --> 00:28:18.864
Now!

00:28:21.101 --> 00:28:22.635
Commencing charge.

00:28:29.008 --> 00:28:31.811
Border Control,
intruder approaching.

00:28:31.845 --> 00:28:34.080
Arm hydro cannon
and lock target.

00:28:34.114 --> 00:28:36.683
Hydro cannon at front border
gate locking in on target.

00:28:36.716 --> 00:28:38.196
Chargers set to maximum power.

00:28:41.455 --> 00:28:42.755
Intruder in sight.

00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:44.023
Take them out!

00:28:48.429 --> 00:28:51.698
What are you
waiting for? Fire!

00:29:22.795 --> 00:29:25.798
Sir, Atlantean hostiles
are approaching.

00:29:25.832 --> 00:29:27.877
Split up. Make your way
to the extraction point.

00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:29.235
Roger.

00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:30.870
They've raided
the storage vault.

00:29:30.904 --> 00:29:32.138
We can't let them get away.

00:29:32.172 --> 00:29:35.008
Don't worry, they
won't. I'm on this one.

00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:50.790
Hold your fire!

00:29:50.823 --> 00:29:52.402
They're cutting through
the Night Market.

00:29:52.426 --> 00:29:54.360
Watch out for the civilians.

00:30:48.848 --> 00:30:50.817
Warning. Warning.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.819
Illegal entrance into hypertube.

00:30:52.852 --> 00:30:55.388
Exceeding maximum
speed of 600 knots.

00:30:55.422 --> 00:30:57.357
Reduce speed immediately.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.471
Oh, shit.

00:32:00.487 --> 00:32:02.623
David, we're here at
the extraction point.

00:32:02.656 --> 00:32:05.958
The orichalcum is onboard and
secure. Come on, let's go!

00:32:05.992 --> 00:32:07.193
Not yet!

00:32:07.226 --> 00:32:09.862
I'm gonna kill me
a dead mermaid.

00:32:20.674 --> 00:32:23.276
Get away from my wife!

00:32:24.911 --> 00:32:26.480
Your wife?

00:32:26.513 --> 00:32:28.948
First you steal your
brother's throne,

00:32:28.981 --> 00:32:30.883
then you steal his woman?

00:32:30.917 --> 00:32:34.153
Aquaman, shame on you.

00:32:41.127 --> 00:32:42.563
Uh, David, we gotta go.

00:32:42.596 --> 00:32:44.931
The entire Atlantean
army is headed this way.

00:32:44.964 --> 00:32:46.899
If we don't leave
now, we're dead.

00:33:34.581 --> 00:33:36.349
Twenty degrees port!

00:33:52.398 --> 00:33:54.233
Fire the sonic cannon!

00:33:55.001 --> 00:33:56.102
Come on, Shin!

00:34:10.016 --> 00:34:11.485
Lady Karshon has called

00:34:11.518 --> 00:34:14.053
an emergency session
of the High Council

00:34:14.086 --> 00:34:17.390
to discuss a motion that would strip
the throne of its executive power.

00:34:17.424 --> 00:34:21.728
The throne is the
heart of Atlantis.

00:34:21.762 --> 00:34:24.431
Too often now it stands empty,

00:34:24.465 --> 00:34:28.167
while our king spends
half his time on land.

00:34:28.201 --> 00:34:32.673
And now his surface world
enemies have followed him home.

00:34:32.706 --> 00:34:35.476
This tragedy is merely a taste

00:34:35.509 --> 00:34:37.778
of the havoc that
will be wrought,

00:34:37.811 --> 00:34:41.582
if Atlantis ever becomes
known to the surface.

00:34:41.615 --> 00:34:45.251
Because if he cannot
protect his own family,

00:34:45.284 --> 00:34:48.387
how is he supposed
to protect us?

00:34:55.462 --> 00:34:59.165
He's different now. He's
stronger than before.

00:34:59.198 --> 00:35:01.200
And he can fight me
without the power suit.

00:35:01.234 --> 00:35:03.470
And where the hell did he
get all the new toys from?

00:35:03.504 --> 00:35:05.071
The technology seems ancient,

00:35:05.104 --> 00:35:07.340
but we've never seen
anything like it.

00:35:07.373 --> 00:35:11.344
That weapon he used fires
some kind of ultrasonic energy

00:35:11.377 --> 00:35:13.179
that disrupts the
nervous system.

00:35:13.212 --> 00:35:14.615
Do we know what was stolen?

00:35:14.648 --> 00:35:18.719
He escaped with a large
stockpile of orichalcum.

00:35:20.454 --> 00:35:22.321
Am I supposed to
know what that is?

00:35:22.355 --> 00:35:25.592
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

00:35:25.626 --> 00:35:28.327
It emits tremendous
amounts of greenhouse gases

00:35:28.361 --> 00:35:30.196
that are highly
destructive to our planet.

00:35:30.229 --> 00:35:33.099
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

00:35:33.132 --> 00:35:35.669
before we realized
what we were doing.

00:35:35.702 --> 00:35:39.372
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

00:35:39.406 --> 00:35:43.075
has been buried in 12 storage
vaults deep underground.

00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:44.787
We should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

00:35:44.811 --> 00:35:47.581
He's already been
there. It's all gone.

00:35:47.614 --> 00:35:49.550
We think he's been
launching secret raids

00:35:49.583 --> 00:35:51.451
for at least five months.

00:35:51.485 --> 00:35:53.119
This is just the
time he got caught.

00:35:53.152 --> 00:35:54.597
Well, this spike in
global temperatures

00:35:54.621 --> 00:35:56.623
that's causing
disasters on the surface

00:35:56.657 --> 00:36:01.495
and making the sea dwellers
sick happened five months ago.

00:36:01.528 --> 00:36:04.631
He's using the stolen
orichalcum to heat the planet.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.502
Why would he do that?

00:36:08.535 --> 00:36:10.704
I don't know, but
I'm gonna find out.

00:36:10.737 --> 00:36:14.140
If he is using the orichalcum to heat
the planet, we don't have much time.

00:36:14.173 --> 00:36:16.242
He is pushing this
past the tipping point.

00:36:16.275 --> 00:36:20.581
He must be stopped or a global
climate meltdown is imminent.

00:36:20.614 --> 00:36:22.214
We need to find him,

00:36:22.248 --> 00:36:23.793
but he's completely
vanished off the radar.

00:36:23.817 --> 00:36:26.152
I think I know someone who
might be able to help us.

00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:28.722
But you're not gonna like it.

00:36:30.457 --> 00:36:32.459
Your brother?

00:36:32.492 --> 00:36:34.571
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

00:36:34.595 --> 00:36:36.630
but he's dealt with
Manta in the past,

00:36:36.663 --> 00:36:38.741
and he's the only one who might
know how to find him in time.

00:36:38.765 --> 00:36:42.536
The Fishermen will never
allow you to speak to Orm.

00:36:42.569 --> 00:36:44.671
He killed their king.

00:36:44.705 --> 00:36:47.239
I wasn't exactly gonna
ask for permission.

00:36:47.273 --> 00:36:51.612
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract
Orm from an allied nation.

00:36:51.645 --> 00:36:53.814
It would be an act of war.

00:36:55.314 --> 00:36:56.850
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

00:36:58.184 --> 00:37:00.219
I'm gonna break him out myself.

00:37:00.252 --> 00:37:03.724
Arthur, Karshon is looking for
a reason to seize war powers.

00:37:03.757 --> 00:37:06.526
You will be nothing more than
a figurehead if she does that.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.937
My place is out
there where I belong,

00:37:07.961 --> 00:37:09.463
where I'm actually
good at what I do.

00:37:09.496 --> 00:37:11.565
I'm tired of nothing
ever getting done.

00:37:12.499 --> 00:37:13.767
I've got to do this.

00:37:15.502 --> 00:37:18.939
If anyone finds out,
if you're caught...

00:37:18.972 --> 00:37:21.207
it will tear the kingdoms apart.

00:37:22.776 --> 00:37:25.712
Then help me not get caught.

00:37:29.816 --> 00:37:31.952
Xebelian intelligence
has recently learned

00:37:31.985 --> 00:37:33.954
that your brother is
being held on the surface

00:37:33.987 --> 00:37:36.556
in a secret one-of-a-kind
underground facility.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.558
They're assuming no sea dweller

00:37:38.592 --> 00:37:40.761
would ever dare
cross the desert.

00:37:40.794 --> 00:37:42.929
And here's a special
outfit for you.

00:37:44.898 --> 00:37:46.466
What is that,
boy's extra medium?

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:47.768
It's supposed to be tight.

00:37:47.801 --> 00:37:49.436
The chromatophores change color

00:37:49.469 --> 00:37:50.880
and camouflage you
for up to a minute,

00:37:50.904 --> 00:37:53.607
making you undetectable
to most sensors.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.542
They'll never see you coming.

00:37:57.978 --> 00:37:59.321
What are we doing for comms?

00:37:59.345 --> 00:38:01.347
Open comms are too risky.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.451
I'll be sending a cephalopod
with you to act as a messenger.

00:38:06.019 --> 00:38:07.721
That's an octopus.

00:38:07.754 --> 00:38:10.824
Tactical Operations
and Pursuit Operative.

00:38:10.857 --> 00:38:12.826
Topo, for short.

00:38:12.859 --> 00:38:14.861
Genetically engineered
intelligence

00:38:14.895 --> 00:38:17.531
for infiltration and espionage.

00:38:17.564 --> 00:38:20.399
He also plays a variety
of musical instruments.

00:38:26.406 --> 00:38:28.542
Just try and lay low when
we get in there, okay?

00:38:28.575 --> 00:38:30.410
You might be invisible,
but your hectocotylus

00:38:30.444 --> 00:38:32.579
is starting to smell
like warm chum butter.

00:38:34.581 --> 00:38:36.450
Aw, Topo, you dumb squid!

00:38:36.483 --> 00:38:37.851
God, come on!

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.688
Is ink piss?

00:38:41.722 --> 00:38:44.458
The prison is guarded by
fearsome Deserter remnants.

00:38:44.491 --> 00:38:45.892
Death-worshipping ascetics

00:38:45.926 --> 00:38:48.360
who survived when
the Sahara went dry

00:38:48.394 --> 00:38:51.031
by turning to blood
for sustenance.

00:38:51.064 --> 00:38:53.365
If they catch you,
they'll bleed you dry.

00:38:54.835 --> 00:38:56.837
When you find Orm,
he'll be weak.

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:59.840
They're limiting
his water supply...

00:38:59.873 --> 00:39:02.274
just enough to keep him alive.

00:39:05.545 --> 00:39:07.881
And if you do see Orm,

00:39:07.914 --> 00:39:09.381
you tell him that I love him.

00:39:10.817 --> 00:39:13.954
You tell him that I
think of him every day.

00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:15.856
I will.

00:39:15.889 --> 00:39:17.591
Look, I know he's family,

00:39:17.624 --> 00:39:19.926
but you can't forget who
you're dealing with here.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.728
Once you've broken Orm out,

00:39:21.762 --> 00:39:23.473
you're not gonna be able
to turn your back on him.

00:39:23.497 --> 00:39:26.265
You need him, but you
can never trust him.

00:40:27.527 --> 00:40:30.730
Whoo... You look rough.

00:40:30.764 --> 00:40:33.733
What the hell are
you doing here?

00:40:33.767 --> 00:40:34.868
I'm here to break you out.

00:40:35.836 --> 00:40:37.137
Have you lost your mind?

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.706
You're the one who put me here.

00:40:39.739 --> 00:40:41.441
Eh, why you bringing
up old shit?

00:40:41.474 --> 00:40:42.985
We'll talk about it later.

00:40:43.009 --> 00:40:45.078
You cannot break me out.

00:40:45.111 --> 00:40:47.614
There's a treaty with
the Fishermen Kingdom.

00:40:47.647 --> 00:40:50.083
Look, I gotta stop David Kane
from destroying the world.

00:40:50.116 --> 00:40:51.561
And you're the only
one that can help me.

00:40:51.585 --> 00:40:52.853
So you do the math.

00:40:52.886 --> 00:40:56.489
Oh, shit.

00:40:56.523 --> 00:40:58.725
Come on, Cast Away.
Grab Wilson. Let's roll.

00:40:58.758 --> 00:41:00.493
Come on. Let's go.

00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:16.843
This changes nothing.

00:41:16.877 --> 00:41:18.717
Wouldn't have it any
other way, little brother.

00:41:20.113 --> 00:41:21.848
Do not call me "brother."

00:41:23.083 --> 00:41:25.418
Hermanito? Come on.

00:41:29.823 --> 00:41:32.959
Come on, Topo, you stupid squid!

00:41:32.993 --> 00:41:34.127
Wake up and open the door.

00:41:36.062 --> 00:41:37.062
Topo?

00:41:38.798 --> 00:41:40.200
The cephalopod?

00:41:40.233 --> 00:41:42.102
Trust me, it wasn't my idea.

00:41:43.837 --> 00:41:45.071
Topo!

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.551
All right, come on.

00:42:05.792 --> 00:42:07.661
Wait.

00:42:10.096 --> 00:42:12.599
Did you... bring water?

00:42:12.632 --> 00:42:13.633
Yeah.

00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:15.568
Uh, no, sorry.

00:42:15.602 --> 00:42:17.070
I drank it all on the way here.

00:42:18.171 --> 00:42:20.440
- What?
- Bro, it's hot up there.

00:42:41.561 --> 00:42:44.698
Whoa! Easy.

00:42:44.731 --> 00:42:47.701
Whoa!

00:42:51.938 --> 00:42:53.249
You know how to
ride one of these?

00:42:53.273 --> 00:42:54.708
Are you kidding?

00:42:54.741 --> 00:42:56.052
I don't even know
what the hell it is.

00:42:56.076 --> 00:42:57.076
- Hyaah!
- What?

00:43:01.881 --> 00:43:03.984
Yeah!

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.128
Yeah!

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:18.630
Whoa.

00:43:35.148 --> 00:43:37.550
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!

00:44:15.355 --> 00:44:17.090
All right, the
water's right there.

00:44:17.123 --> 00:44:18.258
Let's go, skinny jeans.

00:46:08.835 --> 00:46:11.271
Yeah. All right.

00:46:11.304 --> 00:46:13.006
Good job, little
brother. High-five.

00:46:13.039 --> 00:46:14.707
No.

00:46:14.741 --> 00:46:16.743
All right. Good job.

00:46:25.051 --> 00:46:28.121
You know, I got a bunch of king
shit to do back in Atlantis

00:46:28.154 --> 00:46:29.756
so we should go.

00:46:30.857 --> 00:46:32.692
Ahh! Come on, Topo!

00:46:55.348 --> 00:46:58.017
This is worse than I could
have possibly imagined.

00:46:58.051 --> 00:47:01.522
The safety and security of
Atlantis is a sacred trust.

00:47:01.555 --> 00:47:04.257
No king has allowed the great
city wall to be breached

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:06.759
in a hundred generations.

00:47:06.793 --> 00:47:08.529
A hundred generations? Really?

00:47:08.562 --> 00:47:10.763
How many years is that?
I'm bad with geology.

00:47:10.797 --> 00:47:13.166
What is that, like,
a million years?

00:47:13.199 --> 00:47:16.102
Oh? You're calling
me one in a million?

00:47:16.135 --> 00:47:19.138
How can you make jokes
at a time like this?

00:47:19.172 --> 00:47:21.241
It's undignified
for a king to jest.

00:47:21.274 --> 00:47:23.510
Oh, excuse me, Your
Highness, if I use comedy

00:47:23.544 --> 00:47:26.112
to mask my feelings
and deal with stress.

00:47:26.145 --> 00:47:27.390
Otherwise, I'd end
up looking like you.

00:47:27.414 --> 00:47:29.450
A very tight butthole.

00:47:30.316 --> 00:47:33.420
Super tight.

00:47:33.454 --> 00:47:37.023
You know, if the pressures of
leadership are too stressful,

00:47:37.056 --> 00:47:38.925
perhaps you should leave

00:47:38.958 --> 00:47:41.227
and let someone who knows
what they're doing be king.

00:47:43.196 --> 00:47:45.331
You know what?

00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:48.085
I cannot wait to throw your ass back
in prison when this is all over.

00:47:48.201 --> 00:47:50.203
You won't have to.

00:47:50.236 --> 00:47:52.114
Once I stop David Kane, I'll
surrender myself to the Fishermen.

00:47:52.138 --> 00:47:54.240
That is my honor to Atlantis.

00:47:55.409 --> 00:47:56.976
You're so dramatic.

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:59.279
Whatever. Just help
me find this asshole.

00:47:59.312 --> 00:48:01.848
Well, my contact will at
least know where to look.

00:48:03.983 --> 00:48:05.385
What happened to him?

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.456
David Kane that I
knew was ruthless,

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:11.891
but he wasn't insane.

00:48:11.924 --> 00:48:15.161
This guy just put a gun to the
world's head and pulled the trigger.

00:48:15.194 --> 00:48:17.163
Without even making any demands.

00:49:21.227 --> 00:49:23.062
Congratulations, Dr. Shin.

00:49:23.096 --> 00:49:25.377
That cannon of yours worked
exactly how you said it would.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:27.934
Well, you found it.

00:49:27.967 --> 00:49:31.237
All I did was figure
out how it worked.

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:34.541
I didn't think we'd ever actually
have to use it on anyone.

00:49:34.575 --> 00:49:37.143
Yeah, well, what can I say?

00:49:37.176 --> 00:49:39.078
Things don't always
go as planned.

00:49:39.112 --> 00:49:40.312
But that's what I'm afraid of.

00:49:42.215 --> 00:49:46.919
David, this stuff could
reshape the entire planet.

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:50.858
Hey, doc.

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:59.660
We are this close to unlocking the
greatest power in human history.

00:50:01.067 --> 00:50:04.070
Are you really telling me
you want to walk away now?

00:50:08.107 --> 00:50:09.942
If I said yes, would you let me?

00:50:12.245 --> 00:50:13.312
Sure.

00:50:16.015 --> 00:50:17.935
You want to see how long
you last in that jungle?

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.987
Be my guest.

00:50:34.233 --> 00:50:35.469
Yeah, I'll stick around.

00:50:38.505 --> 00:50:39.706
Yeah.

00:50:54.455 --> 00:50:57.390
Welcome to the last frontier.

00:50:57.424 --> 00:51:01.060
They scavenged ships from around
the world to build this place.

00:51:02.261 --> 00:51:03.996
The Sunken Citadel.

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:05.499
It is the one place in the world

00:51:05.532 --> 00:51:07.967
where the scum of the
land and sea mingle.

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.438
It is where people
come to disappear.

00:51:11.472 --> 00:51:12.472
Wow.

00:51:13.607 --> 00:51:16.543
It's an impressive shithole.

00:51:16.577 --> 00:51:18.679
How have I never heard
of this place before?

00:51:18.712 --> 00:51:21.380
It is not meant to
be common knowledge.

00:51:21.415 --> 00:51:22.416
It's a pirate haven.

00:51:23.484 --> 00:51:24.484
Pirates?

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.730
Listen, I don't know if
you know this about me,

00:51:27.754 --> 00:51:30.156
but I'm not too
popular with pirates.

00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.033
Oh, I'm well aware.

00:51:47.407 --> 00:51:50.611
Relax. It was the only
way to get us both in.

00:51:54.146 --> 00:51:55.692
You could've at least
given me a heads up.

00:51:55.716 --> 00:51:57.149
Would you have
gone along with it?

00:51:57.183 --> 00:51:59.285
- Hell, no.
- Then put a hook in it.

00:52:31.818 --> 00:52:33.654
There. That's Kingfish.

00:52:33.687 --> 00:52:35.789
He is the one who put me
in contact with David Kane.

00:52:35.822 --> 00:52:39.426
He brokers deals with pirates,
mercenaries, slavers, you name it.

00:52:39.459 --> 00:52:41.327
Cool.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.496
I'm gonna go pick a fight.

00:52:42.529 --> 00:52:45.231
Just let me handle this.

00:52:45.264 --> 00:52:47.099
He's our best shot
at finding Manta,

00:52:47.133 --> 00:52:49.373
and he's not going to tell us
anything if you go in there

00:52:49.402 --> 00:52:51.137
flexing your muscles at him.

00:52:53.507 --> 00:52:56.175
You're so lucky we didn't grow
up together, little brother.

00:52:57.544 --> 00:53:00.279
Do not call me "brother."

00:53:00.313 --> 00:53:01.615
Well...

00:53:01.648 --> 00:53:05.886
This is a bit of a
surprise, isn't it?

00:53:05.919 --> 00:53:09.288
I didn't realize you'd
been released from prison.

00:53:09.322 --> 00:53:12.358
It is a recent development.

00:53:12.391 --> 00:53:16.195
Outlaws, aren't we all?

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.633
We need to find David Kane.

00:53:19.666 --> 00:53:22.603
Bad news, I'm afraid.

00:53:22.636 --> 00:53:26.305
David Kane is no
longer on the market.

00:53:26.339 --> 00:53:29.342
Not for sale at any price.

00:53:29.375 --> 00:53:33.814
He's solely running as
an independent operator.

00:53:33.847 --> 00:53:35.849
Where is he holed up now?

00:53:39.486 --> 00:53:41.822
In exchange, I offer a favor...

00:53:42.889 --> 00:53:46.392
from the King of Atlantis.

00:53:48.562 --> 00:53:50.573
You seriously expect me to
play footsie with someone

00:53:50.597 --> 00:53:52.532
with that kind of
blood on their hands?

00:53:52.566 --> 00:53:54.935
I don't have hands!

00:53:54.968 --> 00:53:56.536
Or feet!

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:02.643
Um...

00:54:02.676 --> 00:54:06.345
Listen, if the information
checks out good,

00:54:06.379 --> 00:54:09.483
I promise you that I won't
immediately come back here

00:54:09.516 --> 00:54:10.851
and tear this place apart.

00:54:12.786 --> 00:54:15.689
That's too bad.

00:54:15.722 --> 00:54:17.858
Traditionally, the
kings of Atlantis

00:54:17.891 --> 00:54:22.529
have turned a blind eye
to the Sunken Citadel.

00:54:22.562 --> 00:54:26.365
Now, we have to
blind it for you.

00:54:34.808 --> 00:54:36.910
Fine. Flex your muscles.

00:54:49.022 --> 00:54:50.824
Smash his stupid head in!

00:54:51.858 --> 00:54:53.192
Boom!

00:55:08.909 --> 00:55:10.276
Gotcha, fatback!

00:55:13.613 --> 00:55:16.717
Okay! Okay! We can
work this out. We can.

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:18.452
Talk.

00:55:18.485 --> 00:55:20.921
I don't know where he is,
but there have been rumors.

00:55:20.954 --> 00:55:23.557
A dormant volcano in
the South Pacific,

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:25.224
called "Devil's Deep."

00:55:25.826 --> 00:55:27.259
Talk faster.

00:55:27.293 --> 00:55:28.729
It's been barren for years.

00:55:28.762 --> 00:55:30.897
But travelers say there's
a jungle there now.

00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:33.700
Navigation gets scrambled as
soon as you start to get close.

00:55:33.734 --> 00:55:36.703
And if you get too close,
you don't come back!

00:55:36.737 --> 00:55:39.740
If I was a betting man,
and believe me, I am,

00:55:39.773 --> 00:55:41.942
I'd say that's where
Kane is hiding out.

00:55:45.679 --> 00:55:47.246
We got all we needed. Let's go!

00:55:58.859 --> 00:56:02.596
♪ Rise up, come Rise
up through the fire ♪

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.303
Soon you'll be more
powerful than he is.

00:56:11.337 --> 00:56:13.440
But you're not ready yet,

00:56:13.473 --> 00:56:16.308
and you involved
him far too soon.

00:56:16.342 --> 00:56:18.945
I sense them closing in on us.

00:56:18.979 --> 00:56:20.447
Do I seem concerned?

00:56:21.014 --> 00:56:22.549
Hmm?

00:56:22.582 --> 00:56:25.585
If anything, it's
even easier now.

00:56:25.619 --> 00:56:27.788
We couldn't have planned
it any better than...

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:35.962
Oh. Oh.

00:56:35.996 --> 00:56:38.031
Hey.

00:56:38.064 --> 00:56:41.001
Uh, I... I just wanted to tell
you that the orichalcum furnace

00:56:41.034 --> 00:56:42.803
is now running at peak output.

00:57:35.689 --> 00:57:36.690
I win.

00:57:41.094 --> 00:57:44.531
Topo, go back to Atlantis and
give them our coordinates.

00:57:52.639 --> 00:57:54.116
You know what'd be
amazing right now?

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.942
Reinforcements?

00:57:55.976 --> 00:57:58.136
Great, big, greasy cheeseburger
and a pint of Guinness.

00:57:59.813 --> 00:58:01.948
You gotta admit, the food
is so much better up here.

00:58:01.982 --> 00:58:03.516
I find that hard to believe.

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:05.552
Hold up.

00:58:05.585 --> 00:58:06.963
You telling me you never went
topside to have a cheeseburger?

00:58:06.987 --> 00:58:10.457
- What?
- Or a slice of 'za? Pepperoni?

00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:12.926
Or a thick, juicy,
medium raw steak

00:58:12.959 --> 00:58:14.828
with fries and a shake,
and you dip it...

00:58:14.861 --> 00:58:17.530
Even the words that
surface-dwellers give their food

00:58:17.564 --> 00:58:20.667
sound disgusting.

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:23.837
You've let your prejudices stop
you from enjoying half the world.

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:27.040
You should think about
that. It's your loss, dude.

00:58:35.749 --> 00:58:37.150
Aw, yeah!

00:58:37.183 --> 00:58:39.519
Bet you never had one of these.

00:58:39.552 --> 00:58:42.522
- What is it?
- It's a cockroach.

00:58:42.555 --> 00:58:45.125
- You eat it?
- Oh, yeah. Shrimp of the land.

00:59:01.641 --> 00:59:02.976
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Eh?

00:59:03.009 --> 00:59:04.711
That's good. Here, drink this.

00:59:08.915 --> 00:59:10.050
Okay, you first.

00:59:43.616 --> 00:59:44.918
Are you seeing this?

00:59:47.988 --> 00:59:49.089
That's not normal?

00:59:53.994 --> 00:59:56.162
Definitely not normal. Ugh.

00:59:58.965 --> 01:00:00.567
Let's get out of here.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.635
You see how dangerous
the orichalcum can be?

01:00:02.669 --> 01:00:05.872
I bet it mutated the flora and
fauna in a short amount of time,

01:00:05.905 --> 01:00:08.241
turning them... monstrous.

01:00:08.274 --> 01:00:09.274
Whoa.

01:00:18.785 --> 01:00:19.819
Oh, shit...

01:00:31.865 --> 01:00:33.133
Run!

01:00:35.869 --> 01:00:36.869
Come on.

01:00:39.305 --> 01:00:40.540
Faster!

01:00:47.247 --> 01:00:49.049
What the hell are you doing?

01:00:49.082 --> 01:00:50.717
I don't know. I'm
not used to running.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:52.152
Just do what I do.

01:00:52.185 --> 01:00:53.865
Use your arms, use your
legs. Lift them up.

01:00:54.154 --> 01:00:55.155
Like this?

01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:58.691
- Holy shit.
- Yeah!

01:00:58.725 --> 01:00:59.993
- Wait up.
- Yeah!

01:01:25.985 --> 01:01:28.188
Whoa!

01:01:32.392 --> 01:01:34.194
We have to jump. We'll
survive the fall.

01:01:34.227 --> 01:01:36.129
Are you crazy? It's gonna hurt.

01:01:36.162 --> 01:01:39.099
What do you wanna do, stay here
and fight the hopping demons?

01:01:39.132 --> 01:01:41.901
What is that? What
does that say?

01:01:41.935 --> 01:01:43.379
The writing is
ancient Atlantean.

01:01:43.403 --> 01:01:46.606
"A true king builds bridges."

01:01:51.077 --> 01:01:52.712
What are you doing?

01:01:57.418 --> 01:01:59.719
Got any more
krill-brained ideas?

01:02:26.846 --> 01:02:29.716
See? A true king
builds bridges.

01:02:32.819 --> 01:02:34.721
That's a metaphor!

01:02:34.754 --> 01:02:36.856
Hey! I forgot to tell you.

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:38.191
Mom says she loves you.

01:02:38.224 --> 01:02:40.326
She thinks about
you all the time.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:42.695
Why the hell are you
telling me this now?

01:02:42.729 --> 01:02:45.129
I don't know. I'm just tired of
waiting for the right moment.

01:02:52.005 --> 01:02:53.006
Come on.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:23.236
Looks like my metaphor
just saved your ass.

01:03:33.313 --> 01:03:34.914
Uh, David? I just
ran more tests,

01:03:34.948 --> 01:03:36.483
and this data is
really disturbing.

01:03:36.517 --> 01:03:39.719
We have to stop burning
the... orichalcum.

01:03:42.021 --> 01:03:43.022
David?

01:03:48.361 --> 01:03:49.896
Oh.

01:04:52.091 --> 01:04:57.230
Okay, doc, you want to
know my plan so bad.

01:04:58.398 --> 01:05:00.534
Here it is.

01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:05.472
I'm gonna kill Aquaman and
destroy everything he holds dear.

01:05:05.506 --> 01:05:10.810
I'm gonna murder his family
and burn his kingdom to ash.

01:05:11.944 --> 01:05:16.316
I will avenge my father.

01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:19.352
Even if I have to make a
deal with the devil to do it.

01:05:20.987 --> 01:05:23.256
David, you can't
trust the trident.

01:05:28.361 --> 01:05:34.000
I never draw this blade
unless it's gonna taste blood.

01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:39.339
Pray I never show
it to you again.

01:06:03.664 --> 01:06:06.467
We must be getting close
to the radiation source.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.968
We should wait for Atlantis
to receive your message.

01:06:09.001 --> 01:06:11.037
We can conduct reconnaissance
in the meantime.

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:13.516
Yeah. Look, Loki, I'm not
asking for your advice on this.

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.476
You've already lived up
to your end of the deal.

01:06:15.509 --> 01:06:17.977
So you can go on back to
Azkaban for all I care.

01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:19.912
So, what's your plan?

01:06:19.946 --> 01:06:21.624
I don't have one, yet.
But he came after my wife,

01:06:21.648 --> 01:06:24.317
which means I'm gonna pull
his tongue out of his butt.

01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:27.086
Arthur, you are the king. You
cannot let this get personal.

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:29.666
This coming from the guy who turned
the entire nation of Atlantis

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:31.391
into his own private ego trip?

01:06:31.425 --> 01:06:33.059
My ego?

01:06:33.092 --> 01:06:34.437
You're the one who swam
through the front gate

01:06:34.461 --> 01:06:36.262
and challenged my
claim for the throne.

01:06:36.295 --> 01:06:38.140
Only because you're trying
to destroy the surface world.

01:06:38.164 --> 01:06:41.134
If you weren't such an
asshole, you'd still be king.

01:06:41.167 --> 01:06:42.536
Unbelievable.

01:06:42.569 --> 01:06:44.203
Wait, wait! Wait!

01:06:44.237 --> 01:06:46.172
You took my throne and
you don't even want it?

01:06:46.205 --> 01:06:48.941
Are you kidding me?
I hate this job.

01:06:48.975 --> 01:06:51.721
Only reason I'm doing it is to keep
Atlantis from destroying the surface.

01:06:51.745 --> 01:06:53.480
And I might even be
screwing that up.

01:06:53.514 --> 01:06:54.724
You really had no
ambition for it?

01:06:54.748 --> 01:06:56.483
Absolutely not.

01:06:56.517 --> 01:06:58.552
From the day my father
found out you existed,

01:06:58.585 --> 01:07:00.362
he prepared me for the
moment that you would come

01:07:00.386 --> 01:07:01.598
and challenge me for the throne.

01:07:01.622 --> 01:07:03.322
Wow, that's really sad.

01:07:03.356 --> 01:07:04.701
Especially when you think
how easily I kicked your ass

01:07:04.725 --> 01:07:07.226
with basically no
prep time whatsoever.

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.395
Roasted.

01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:11.164
That is not how it happened.

01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:13.008
- That's exactly how it happened.
- Mera saved you.

01:07:13.032 --> 01:07:14.967
No, she didn't. I
kicked your ass.

01:07:15.001 --> 01:07:16.746
Nope. She made the little
water tornado. I fell in it.

01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:18.490
Okay, shut up. I
think we're here.

01:07:26.713 --> 01:07:28.549
Sleep, aloha.

01:07:28.582 --> 01:07:30.049
Come on, let's do this.

01:07:30.082 --> 01:07:31.418
Once this is over with,

01:07:31.452 --> 01:07:33.019
we should go get some
burgers and beers.

01:07:33.052 --> 01:07:34.597
- Don't push it.
- Tacos and tequila.

01:07:34.621 --> 01:07:36.289
I don't even know those words.

01:07:47.734 --> 01:07:49.101
- Huh?
- Shh!

01:08:03.382 --> 01:08:04.451
Hey!

01:08:38.585 --> 01:08:40.019
Whoa, brother.

01:08:43.155 --> 01:08:44.223
Sasa!

01:08:50.531 --> 01:08:52.164
It's an orichalcum furnace.

01:08:53.433 --> 01:08:55.067
All that stolen orichalcum.

01:08:55.101 --> 01:08:56.670
They're just burning it up.

01:08:56.703 --> 01:08:59.105
He's heating the
atmosphere on purpose.

01:08:59.138 --> 01:09:00.707
This is catastrophic.

01:09:00.741 --> 01:09:03.242
This whole place must be
heat-shielded to protect it

01:09:03.276 --> 01:09:05.546
from the surface's
thermal satellites.

01:09:05.579 --> 01:09:07.179
Question is, how do we stop 'em?

01:09:07.213 --> 01:09:08.582
To take out this reactor,

01:09:08.615 --> 01:09:10.316
we would have to crater
the entire island.

01:09:10.349 --> 01:09:14.186
Get away from there! Now!

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:18.391
This blaster may be ancient, but it
was built for killing Atlanteans.

01:09:24.731 --> 01:09:27.099
Okay, I am so sorry.
I did not mean that.

01:09:27.133 --> 01:09:29.813
I just didn't want you to break me
in half before I could surrender.

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:32.439
Please take me with you.

01:09:34.173 --> 01:09:36.643
Knock him out and then
help me hide these bodies.

01:09:36.677 --> 01:09:38.745
No, no. Wait, please.

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:40.547
I didn't want any of this.

01:09:40.581 --> 01:09:43.650
All I wanted was to see
Atlantis with my own eyes.

01:09:43.684 --> 01:09:45.786
I thought I could share
its wonders with the world.

01:09:45.819 --> 01:09:50.122
I'm a scientist, and I just
wanted to be taken seriously.

01:09:50.156 --> 01:09:51.491
David Kane said
he could help me,

01:09:51.525 --> 01:09:53.359
but now he won't let me leave.

01:09:53.392 --> 01:09:56.329
You expect us to believe you
have nothing to do with this?

01:09:57.363 --> 01:09:58.832
I know.

01:09:58.865 --> 01:10:01.167
I've done things
I'm not proud of.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.604
But he would've
killed me if I hadn't.

01:10:03.637 --> 01:10:05.672
Knock him out.

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:08.408
No.

01:10:08.442 --> 01:10:10.242
- Then I'll knock him out.
- No!

01:10:11.411 --> 01:10:13.145
- What?
- No.

01:10:13.179 --> 01:10:15.549
Fine!

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:17.751
You can come with us.

01:10:17.784 --> 01:10:19.820
Oh... thank you.

01:10:19.853 --> 01:10:22.656
But you better start talking.
Or I'm gonna give you one sasa!

01:10:22.689 --> 01:10:24.156
Okay, okay.

01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:25.525
It's the black trident.

01:10:25.559 --> 01:10:27.694
It's a direct link
to some ancient evil.

01:10:27.728 --> 01:10:29.429
It gives Kane great
powers and in return...

01:10:46.947 --> 01:10:49.315
I hate when that happens.

01:11:02.228 --> 01:11:03.563
Stop them!

01:13:05.485 --> 01:13:08.054
Whoa!

01:13:08.088 --> 01:13:09.656
Ow!

01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:11.323
Ow!

01:13:16.797 --> 01:13:19.533
No, no, no, no, no!
Not the orichalcum!

01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:20.734
You wanna blow us up?

01:13:20.767 --> 01:13:22.569
- This stuff blows up?
- Yes!

01:13:22.602 --> 01:13:24.971
My bad!

01:13:27.073 --> 01:13:29.476
Then stop using it!

01:13:29.509 --> 01:13:31.310
Just shut up and let
me save your ass.

01:13:31.878 --> 01:13:32.879
Again.

01:14:56.129 --> 01:14:58.832
He's going to fight us
without the power suit?

01:14:58.865 --> 01:15:00.467
I told you he's stronger now.

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:03.670
He's still just a
surface-dweller.

01:15:12.479 --> 01:15:13.980
- Bro!
- Bah!

01:15:18.718 --> 01:15:22.756
I never expected to see you
two fighting side by side.

01:15:22.789 --> 01:15:25.025
We're making a special
exception just for you.

01:15:30.563 --> 01:15:33.033
No one hits my brother but me.

01:15:33.066 --> 01:15:37.637
I was gonna kill you last,
but thanks for dropping by.

01:15:37.671 --> 01:15:39.072
You're making this easy.

01:15:52.852 --> 01:15:54.120
Yeah!

01:15:54.154 --> 01:15:56.523
Come at me, the killer of kings.

01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:58.651
Take that island down!

01:17:21.841 --> 01:17:23.109
Fire at will!

01:17:34.954 --> 01:17:36.556
We've got to get out of here.

01:17:47.033 --> 01:17:48.735
Malfunction. Malfunction.

01:17:48.768 --> 01:17:50.036
Warning. Warning.

01:18:16.062 --> 01:18:17.697
Shin, let's go!

01:18:22.902 --> 01:18:24.304
What are you waiting for?

01:18:24.337 --> 01:18:26.172
Fire the goddamn cannon!

01:19:30.103 --> 01:19:31.938
I'm sorry to drag
you all into this.

01:19:31.971 --> 01:19:34.211
But the Fishermen can't think
that Atlantis was involved.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:37.478
Atlantis does not command
the armies of Xebel. I do.

01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:38.978
And the Brine Kingdom

01:19:39.012 --> 01:19:41.080
has not forgotten
its debt to you.

01:19:41.114 --> 01:19:43.349
You may count on us always.

01:19:43.383 --> 01:19:45.486
Something happened to me.

01:19:45.519 --> 01:19:48.254
When I touched
that black trident.

01:19:48.288 --> 01:19:50.457
Why is he even here?

01:19:50.491 --> 01:19:52.258
He should be on his
way back to prison.

01:19:52.292 --> 01:19:54.060
We should hear
what he has to say.

01:19:54.093 --> 01:19:55.962
I made that mistake once.

01:19:55.995 --> 01:19:58.198
That's why I know
he can't be trusted.

01:19:58.231 --> 01:20:01.468
And he cut off my claw.

01:20:01.502 --> 01:20:04.137
This thing took a whole
year to grow back.

01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:06.739
Look, he wants to stop
Manta same as we do.

01:20:06.773 --> 01:20:08.341
And just for the record,

01:20:08.374 --> 01:20:10.494
the only reason we made it
this far is because of him.

01:20:12.912 --> 01:20:14.214
I saw the Lost Kingdom.

01:20:18.184 --> 01:20:20.887
Mom, I don't know
enough about this.

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.922
Is that even possible?

01:20:22.956 --> 01:20:25.892
All anyone knows for sure is
there once was a seventh kingdom

01:20:25.925 --> 01:20:28.962
and then one day,
just before the fall,

01:20:28.995 --> 01:20:32.065
every record of it was
stricken from the chronicles.

01:20:32.098 --> 01:20:34.834
How do you know what you
saw was the Lost Kingdom?

01:20:34.867 --> 01:20:37.870
No one even knows what
it was called anymore.

01:20:37.904 --> 01:20:39.272
It's called Necrus.

01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:41.975
And I didn't just see it.

01:20:43.276 --> 01:20:44.277
I knew it.

01:20:45.912 --> 01:20:49.215
It's almost like I
was... remembering it.

01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:54.120
Flashes of someone
else's memories.

01:20:55.054 --> 01:20:56.889
During King Atlan's time,

01:20:56.923 --> 01:21:01.160
there were seven united
kingdoms of Atlantis.

01:21:01.194 --> 01:21:05.064
And the Black City was
a curse upon them all.

01:21:11.938 --> 01:21:13.840
By exploiting orichalcum,

01:21:13.873 --> 01:21:17.076
Necrus rapidly became a
superpower unlike any other.

01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:18.978
But it came at a terrible price.

01:21:19.012 --> 01:21:22.215
Poisoning the land, the sea,

01:21:22.248 --> 01:21:25.084
even the mind of the
tyrant who ruled Necrus.

01:21:28.354 --> 01:21:30.990
Atlan's own brother, Kordax.

01:21:31.024 --> 01:21:32.901
Atlan pleaded with him

01:21:32.925 --> 01:21:35.028
to stop using it
before the world

01:21:35.061 --> 01:21:36.896
was irrevocably damaged.

01:21:36.929 --> 01:21:39.433
However, Kordax resented Atlan,

01:21:39.466 --> 01:21:42.335
thinking his own brother was
trying to steal his power.

01:21:42.368 --> 01:21:47.840
So, he resorted to dark magic and
crafted an instrument of evil.

01:21:47.874 --> 01:21:49.208
That black trident.

01:21:59.285 --> 01:22:02.155
He transformed his people
and himself into monsters...

01:22:06.225 --> 01:22:08.294
to fight Atlantis.

01:22:08.328 --> 01:22:10.029
So, the two brothers
went to war.

01:22:19.305 --> 01:22:21.240
But Atlan defeated Kordax

01:22:21.274 --> 01:22:24.277
and imprisoned him
and all of Necrus

01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:27.246
with a spell cast
with his own blood...

01:22:30.517 --> 01:22:35.589
to ensure that Kordax's dark
power would never be found.

01:22:35.622 --> 01:22:38.324
And that is why Necrus is
stricken from the chronicles.

01:22:49.703 --> 01:22:52.905
This evil was supposed to
remain frozen for eternity.

01:22:55.409 --> 01:22:57.009
But David Kane has found it.

01:22:58.612 --> 01:23:01.582
And it's slowly possessing him.

01:23:01.615 --> 01:23:03.417
But even with the
ice cap melting,

01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:05.486
Kordax still can't be freed.

01:23:05.519 --> 01:23:08.187
Atlan used blood magic to
seal Kordax in his prison.

01:23:08.221 --> 01:23:10.156
Only Atlan himself
could release him.

01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:11.658
Manta doesn't need
Atlan himself.

01:23:11.692 --> 01:23:15.161
Manta needs Atlan's blood.

01:23:15.194 --> 01:23:17.230
Blood magic isn't
really magic, it's DNA.

01:23:17.263 --> 01:23:22.436
The key to Kordax's prison is
the royal bloodline itself.

01:23:22.469 --> 01:23:25.938
That means he needs blood
from either you, me or Arthur.

01:23:28.307 --> 01:23:29.547
We're the end of the bloodline.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.315
No, we're not.

01:23:36.349 --> 01:23:38.994
Wildfires would have made
headlines across the world,

01:23:39.018 --> 01:23:41.320
but now, they're almost
a weekly occurrence.

01:23:41.354 --> 01:23:44.425
We're witnessing unprecedented
weather events across the globe,

01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:46.125
and meteorologists are at a loss

01:23:46.159 --> 01:23:48.027
to explain this rapid
change in climate.

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:49.696
From sweltering
heatwaves and droughts,

01:23:49.730 --> 01:23:51.732
which are shattering
temperature records,

01:23:51.765 --> 01:23:53.434
to torrential rains
and floodings...

01:23:53.467 --> 01:23:55.602
- What is going on?
- Hurricane bearing down

01:23:55.636 --> 01:23:58.104
on the East Coast, leaving one
million homes without power...

01:24:00.441 --> 01:24:03.309
Make that a million and one.

01:24:03.342 --> 01:24:05.446
I gotta get the
flashlight, bubba.

01:24:23.162 --> 01:24:26.500
I'm gonna leave you alive,
so he can watch you die.

01:24:35.174 --> 01:24:36.410
Dad!

01:24:36.443 --> 01:24:38.110
- Tom!
- Dad!

01:24:39.345 --> 01:24:40.346
Tom!

01:24:41.448 --> 01:24:43.216
No! Dad!

01:24:43.249 --> 01:24:44.350
Where's Junior?

01:24:47.654 --> 01:24:49.523
No!

01:24:49.556 --> 01:24:51.257
I'm sorry, son.

01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:53.159
Where's Junior?

01:24:53.192 --> 01:24:56.597
Manta... took Junior.

01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:58.465
- No!
- No!

01:24:59.433 --> 01:25:01.033
No!

01:25:56.657 --> 01:25:58.725
The medics have
stabilized his condition.

01:25:58.759 --> 01:26:00.460
He will be okay.

01:26:00.494 --> 01:26:02.161
We just picked up a signal.

01:26:02.194 --> 01:26:04.096
It's faint,

01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:06.600
but it's broadcasting on an
old Atlantean sonar frequency.

01:26:06.633 --> 01:26:08.401
Headed to Antarctica.

01:26:09.636 --> 01:26:11.838
- Bring our little one back.
- I will.

01:26:13.774 --> 01:26:16.208
I've dreamed of this.

01:26:16.242 --> 01:26:18.645
The two of you standing
together as brothers.

01:26:22.616 --> 01:26:24.651
Promise me you will
protect each other.

01:26:28.154 --> 01:26:29.823
Promise me, Orm.

01:26:43.770 --> 01:26:44.805
Go.

01:27:11.297 --> 01:27:13.834
Great waves, Nereus.

01:27:13.867 --> 01:27:18.438
Your warship is powerful, but
it's slower than a sea cow.

01:27:18.472 --> 01:27:23.342
I say we ditch all this dead
weight and travel light. Hmm?

01:27:23.376 --> 01:27:25.755
And what are you gonna do when
he turns on that sonic cannon?

01:27:25.779 --> 01:27:27.681
Our only chance is to hit him

01:27:27.714 --> 01:27:30.417
with total overwhelming
force from every direction.

01:27:30.450 --> 01:27:32.419
Not with Junior
in the crossfire.

01:27:32.452 --> 01:27:33.754
What choice do we have?

01:27:33.787 --> 01:27:35.555
We have no defense
against that cannon.

01:27:35.589 --> 01:27:36.923
Well, wait a minute.

01:27:36.957 --> 01:27:38.725
So this cannon
sends out soundwaves

01:27:38.759 --> 01:27:40.827
that messes with our
nervous system, right?

01:27:40.861 --> 01:27:43.830
That's right.
Ultrasonic echoes.

01:27:43.864 --> 01:27:45.499
Well, what if we
disrupt those echoes

01:27:45.532 --> 01:27:47.400
with another soundwave
on the same frequency,

01:27:47.434 --> 01:27:49.536
but just much, much louder?

01:27:49.569 --> 01:27:52.238
You wanna disrupt
their disruption?

01:27:52.271 --> 01:27:53.671
Well, that's gonna
be the easy part.

01:27:54.708 --> 01:27:56.677
Take your weapons.

01:27:58.277 --> 01:27:59.579
And ready your steeds.

01:28:08.722 --> 01:28:09.990
Hmm.

01:28:20.266 --> 01:28:22.301
Really doesn't
like you, does he?

01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:55.836
We made a lot of progress, doc.

01:28:55.869 --> 01:28:58.270
They destroyed the furnace
before we could finish the job,

01:28:58.304 --> 01:28:59.773
but we were damn close.

01:28:59.806 --> 01:29:02.274
One well-placed missile
should do the trick.

01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:07.547
My God, what did we do?

01:29:07.581 --> 01:29:10.316
Nothing the world
wasn't already doing.

01:29:10.349 --> 01:29:12.919
All we did was fast
forward things a few years.

01:29:12.953 --> 01:29:14.564
The ice hasn't fully melted yet,

01:29:14.588 --> 01:29:16.523
but our scanning
reveals a weak spot.

01:29:17.424 --> 01:29:18.725
Here.

01:29:18.759 --> 01:29:20.927
This will lead you
straight to Kordax.

01:29:22.829 --> 01:29:24.498
Power up the sonic cannon.

01:29:26.032 --> 01:29:27.501
Bag the child and suit up.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:57.564
Yah!

01:29:57.597 --> 01:29:59.757
Captain, we have multiple
incoming hostiles.

01:30:01.601 --> 01:30:02.736
You're too late.

01:30:12.612 --> 01:30:13.612
No.

01:30:39.506 --> 01:30:41.141
Commence charge.

01:31:31.691 --> 01:31:34.928
You've got to be kidding me.

01:32:10.864 --> 01:32:12.132
Astounding.

01:32:55.241 --> 01:32:57.777
This place is immense.
It could be anywhere.

01:32:57.811 --> 01:33:00.146
The throne of Necrus is
in the heart of the city.

01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:01.657
I sense something in the water.

01:33:01.681 --> 01:33:02.921
Everyone, light it up.

01:33:07.721 --> 01:33:12.625
Didn't you say that Kordax turned
his people into an army of monsters?

01:33:12.659 --> 01:33:14.294
Yes. I did.

01:33:14.327 --> 01:33:16.596
Keep your eyes open.

01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:19.632
Well, that'll be easy.
Mine don't close.

01:33:19.666 --> 01:33:22.235
Everyone stand ready.
Something's coming.

01:33:27.273 --> 01:33:29.809
Fire at will!

01:33:46.059 --> 01:33:47.336
I think this goes
all the way through.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.563
My men and I can deal
with these worms.

01:33:50.597 --> 01:33:53.299
Go now and save the prince.

01:33:53.333 --> 01:33:54.834
Thank you, Your Highness.

01:33:57.137 --> 01:33:59.873
Come on, you spineless worms!

01:33:59.906 --> 01:34:01.141
Bring it on!

01:35:10.043 --> 01:35:11.144
Help me!

01:36:14.207 --> 01:36:16.109
Give me the child.

01:37:10.396 --> 01:37:13.900
You picked the wrong day
to grow a spine, doc.

01:37:17.438 --> 01:37:19.872
Get behind the portcullis!

01:37:19.906 --> 01:37:23.009
We need to close the gate!

01:37:59.979 --> 01:38:03.016
Get away from my son!

01:38:03.049 --> 01:38:06.019
Your blood will do just fine.

01:38:07.954 --> 01:38:11.157
You want blood? Come get it!

01:38:25.004 --> 01:38:26.440
Aquaman!

01:39:00.106 --> 01:39:01.475
Oh!

01:39:15.021 --> 01:39:18.592
You wear my brother's armor,
and wield his trident,

01:39:18.625 --> 01:39:21.428
but you're only
half the man he was.

01:39:21.462 --> 01:39:24.297
How pathetic.

01:39:38.645 --> 01:39:40.012
Mera!

01:39:55.328 --> 01:39:56.396
Go!

01:40:11.077 --> 01:40:12.679
Mera...

01:40:14.046 --> 01:40:15.047
Run!

01:40:19.085 --> 01:40:21.254
Free me from my prison,

01:40:21.287 --> 01:40:26.959
and all my power will be
yours to wield as you desire.

01:41:02.663 --> 01:41:07.233
Kill him, and you will
be Ocean Master again!

01:41:15.074 --> 01:41:17.578
Well, now this is
certainly an improvement.

01:41:17.611 --> 01:41:20.447
Powerful, Atlantean body.

01:41:20.481 --> 01:41:23.784
And this one hates you more
than the other one did.

01:41:23.817 --> 01:41:25.294
It's not true. Come
on, little brother.

01:41:25.318 --> 01:41:26.653
I know you're in there.

01:41:26.687 --> 01:41:29.222
Don't you see? You can't win.

01:41:29.255 --> 01:41:32.526
Either you kill your
brother or you die.

01:41:47.774 --> 01:41:52.311
By an Atlan's blood,
this magic is broken.

01:42:05.526 --> 01:42:09.028
My eternal night is ending.

01:42:16.202 --> 01:42:18.639
I'm done fighting
your puppets, Kordax.

01:42:19.806 --> 01:42:22.074
I'm coming for you.

01:42:25.144 --> 01:42:26.154
- Give it to me!
- No!

01:42:26.178 --> 01:42:27.748
I can end this.

01:42:27.781 --> 01:42:31.284
Don't let him take it! Hasn't
he taken enough already?

01:42:32.819 --> 01:42:34.287
Yield the throne.

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:37.724
It's time for me to
reclaim my destiny.

01:42:37.758 --> 01:42:40.661
It would be foolish to
think he could ever change.

01:42:40.694 --> 01:42:42.596
I knew you would do this.

01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:44.498
You are the one true king.

01:42:44.531 --> 01:42:48.100
Atlantis deserves
its one true king.

01:42:50.369 --> 01:42:54.340
I am the one true king!

01:43:01.715 --> 01:43:03.349
You know, there was a time

01:43:03.382 --> 01:43:05.819
when I wanted to meet
you more than anything.

01:43:05.852 --> 01:43:07.821
Let you know that
you weren't alone,

01:43:07.854 --> 01:43:09.756
that we were in it together.

01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:11.692
Promise me you'll
protect each other.

01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:20.601
Come on, little brother,
let's end this bastard.

01:43:20.634 --> 01:43:23.904
I meant what I said
when I first met you.

01:43:23.937 --> 01:43:26.673
No matter what,
you are not alone.

01:43:26.707 --> 01:43:28.140
We're in this together.

01:43:31.578 --> 01:43:32.846
You are my brother.

01:43:38.518 --> 01:43:39.518
Orm.

01:43:42.522 --> 01:43:43.523
Let go.

01:43:58.404 --> 01:43:59.640
Orm, let it go.

01:44:19.325 --> 01:44:22.596
I live again!

01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:26.566
I have waited countless
centuries in the dark

01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:28.300
for this moment.

01:44:34.474 --> 01:44:35.642
Shit.

01:44:43.382 --> 01:44:44.584
Arthur!

01:46:10.871 --> 01:46:12.338
Never.

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:23.382
Arthur, we've gotta go.
The magic is broken.

01:46:38.565 --> 01:46:39.633
Let's get outta here!

01:46:52.012 --> 01:46:53.847
Hurry!

01:46:57.884 --> 01:46:59.786
That's right!

01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:01.421
Come on, baby! Yeah!

01:47:17.537 --> 01:47:20.907
Yeah!

01:47:38.825 --> 01:47:39.826
My love.

01:47:41.761 --> 01:47:43.897
Hi, baby boy.

01:47:53.607 --> 01:47:54.607
Shin.

01:47:55.108 --> 01:47:56.443
Thank you.

01:48:02.916 --> 01:48:04.484
Astounding.

01:48:09.222 --> 01:48:12.759
All here looking intact.
That's good. That's good.

01:48:12.792 --> 01:48:13.894
Well, I'm not.

01:48:13.927 --> 01:48:15.996
My claw got cut off.

01:48:16.029 --> 01:48:17.564
Again!

01:48:19.199 --> 01:48:20.209
You're one tough
crustacean, Your Highness.

01:48:20.233 --> 01:48:21.735
Bah!

01:48:21.768 --> 01:48:24.004
As far as I'm concerned,
your debt is paid.

01:48:25.538 --> 01:48:27.406
Not everybody's gonna
see it that way though.

01:48:32.112 --> 01:48:34.681
It's too bad you went and had
yourself killed back there.

01:48:36.716 --> 01:48:37.784
Yes.

01:48:37.817 --> 01:48:38.985
All this ice.

01:48:40.654 --> 01:48:42.756
It'd be impossible
to find the body.

01:48:44.591 --> 01:48:45.835
Just lay low for a while.

01:48:45.859 --> 01:48:48.161
But don't go too far.

01:48:48.194 --> 01:48:50.096
I may need to call you
up for some advice.

01:48:50.130 --> 01:48:53.033
You know, with the whole
running the kingdom thing.

01:48:59.072 --> 01:49:00.173
Thank you...

01:49:02.042 --> 01:49:03.710
brother.

01:49:18.825 --> 01:49:20.894
You're not as bad at
this as you think.

01:49:22.762 --> 01:49:25.565
The people of Atlantis
are lucky to have you.

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:28.868
You are everything I was not.

01:49:28.902 --> 01:49:31.671
You do the right thing when doing
the wrong thing is much easier.

01:49:32.973 --> 01:49:34.574
And you're willing
to ask for help

01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:37.043
even from your worst enemy.

01:49:39.112 --> 01:49:40.714
I know it may not feel like

01:49:40.747 --> 01:49:42.291
you know what you're
doing sometimes, but...

01:49:42.315 --> 01:49:44.918
keep trusting your instincts.

01:49:44.951 --> 01:49:47.821
If you lead,
Atlantis will follow.

01:49:51.157 --> 01:49:54.594
After all, a true king
builds bridges, right?

01:49:55.862 --> 01:49:57.222
I thought that was
just a metaphor.

01:50:00.133 --> 01:50:04.971
Well, your metaphor might have
just saved the world's ass.

01:50:28.995 --> 01:50:30.597
We've got breaking news.

01:50:30.630 --> 01:50:32.165
We are witnessing history.

01:50:32.198 --> 01:50:34.267
A moment the ramifications
of which simply...

01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:35.300
cannot be overstated.

01:50:38.271 --> 01:50:39.939
A first contact...

01:50:39.973 --> 01:50:41.775
with the undersea
nation of Atlantis.

01:50:41.808 --> 01:50:43.686
An entire civilization
hidden for thousands of years

01:50:43.710 --> 01:50:45.211
about to be revealed.

01:50:51.785 --> 01:50:53.095
I think it's safe to say

01:50:53.119 --> 01:50:54.621
the world will
never be the same.

01:50:54.654 --> 01:50:56.022
The King of Atlantis

01:50:56.056 --> 01:50:57.690
has reached out to
the United Nations

01:50:57.724 --> 01:50:59.626
and will be officially
seeking membership.

01:50:59.659 --> 01:51:00.703
And is expected to
propose a joint effort

01:51:00.727 --> 01:51:02.328
to reverse the climate issues.

01:51:02.362 --> 01:51:04.173
We are told that
this was the result

01:51:04.197 --> 01:51:06.766
of weeks of secret negotiations
with the United Nations.

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:08.601
We now go live to Ellis Island,

01:51:08.635 --> 01:51:10.346
where the first official
ambassador from Atlantis

01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:12.672
is about to address
the United Nations.

01:51:21.681 --> 01:51:25.085
I come here today as a
representative of two worlds.

01:51:25.118 --> 01:51:27.654
The land and the sea.

01:51:31.124 --> 01:51:35.361
And I stand here as proof
that change is coming to both.

01:51:35.395 --> 01:51:41.167
And I'm calling for global
unity for a global crisis.

01:51:41.201 --> 01:51:43.269
To finally bring
harmony between us

01:51:43.303 --> 01:51:46.372
and the natural
balance of our world.

01:51:46.406 --> 01:51:48.241
Atlantis stands ready
to help contribute

01:51:48.274 --> 01:51:50.777
its science and technology.

01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:52.413
And with your
knowledge of the air,

01:51:52.446 --> 01:51:54.415
and our knowledge of the seas,

01:51:54.448 --> 01:51:57.418
together we can write the
next chapter in our story,

01:51:57.451 --> 01:51:59.819
rather than its ending.

01:51:59.853 --> 01:52:03.389
Sometimes it's gonna seem like
our differences are too extreme,

01:52:03.424 --> 01:52:06.993
but all we have to do is
look beneath the surface,

01:52:07.026 --> 01:52:08.695
to see that we're all
here on this planet

01:52:08.728 --> 01:52:11.164
with the same goals
and aspirations.

01:52:11.197 --> 01:52:12.775
- Even when our customs...
- Here you go.

01:52:12.799 --> 01:52:13.733
Might seem strange
and unfamiliar.

01:52:13.766 --> 01:52:15.301
Beer and a cheeseburger.

01:52:15.335 --> 01:52:17.337
Extra greasy like you asked for.

01:52:19.172 --> 01:52:21.741
And by overcoming
our prejudices,

01:52:21.774 --> 01:52:25.145
we'll become stronger and
learn more about ourselves.

01:52:25.178 --> 01:52:28.815
We can seize this moment to create
a better more hopeful future,

01:52:28.848 --> 01:52:32.152
for our children,
and our families.

01:52:33.753 --> 01:52:35.889
My name is Arthur Curry.

01:52:35.922 --> 01:52:39.460
I'm the rightful sovereign of
the undersea nation of Atlantis.

01:52:39.493 --> 01:52:41.694
I'm a father, a brother,

01:52:41.728 --> 01:52:44.164
a warrior and a friend.

01:52:45.298 --> 01:52:47.200
I'm the King of Atlantis.

01:52:48.868 --> 01:52:50.336
I am Aquaman.
