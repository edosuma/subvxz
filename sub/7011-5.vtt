WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:06.300
Oh, don't put Batman
in the clam of death, Riddler.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.200
That's just gonna make him mad.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.300
God, you're stupid.

00:12.600 --> 00:15.900
Fez, for the last time,
the Riddler can't hear you.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.600
Riddle me this, Riddler.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.500
When Batman escapes
from the clam of death...

00:21.500 --> 00:24.300
who will kick your riddle-telling ass in?

00:25.700 --> 00:27.700
Hey, Fez. Riddle me this.

00:27.700 --> 00:29.700
[Grunts]

00:30.900 --> 00:32.900
Then riddle me this.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.000
[Chuckles]

00:39.400 --> 00:42.100
Oh, but, Fez,
only if you riddle me this.

00:42.100 --> 00:44.900
Ow!

00:44.900 --> 00:47.100
Riddle me this,
you son of a bitch!

00:52.300 --> 00:55.800
- Oh, my God! Guess what!
- Stop! Fez!

00:55.800 --> 00:58.200
This could be important!

01:02.300 --> 01:05.800
You guys, the Roller Disco Doo-dah
is coming to Kenosha next Friday!

01:05.700 --> 01:08.500
Oh, my God! Guess what!
[Raspberry]

01:10.700 --> 01:15.500
See, now, that's the kind of thing the judges
really frown upon during competition, Steven.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.700
Excuse me?

01:17.600 --> 01:19.600
We're gonna be partners!

01:22.400 --> 01:24.900
Skating partners.

01:24.800 --> 01:29.300
Hey, how about instead, you hit me in the face
with a wrench, and I black out?

01:30.500 --> 01:32.800
Steven...

01:32.700 --> 01:35.900
this is not just a last chance
at roller disco.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.400
It's a last chance at love-

01:39.300 --> 01:42.000
our love.

01:41.900 --> 01:45.300
Now, will you or will you not
skate with me?

01:45.300 --> 01:47.200
I would, Jackie...

01:47.200 --> 01:50.500
but seeing you there
in your cute little skating outfit...

01:50.400 --> 01:53.400
with all your tassels and sequins...

01:53.300 --> 01:55.600
I might be tempted to...

01:55.600 --> 01:57.600
push you down a flight of stairs.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.600
All right.

02:01.600 --> 02:05.700
Jackie, what do you say-
you and me, roller disco?

02:05.600 --> 02:09.199
I mean, we used to have some good moves,
you know, like, when we did it...

02:09.199 --> 02:13.000
so it would be like that...

02:12.900 --> 02:16.900
except for with lights and skates.

02:16.800 --> 02:21.100
Okay. Um, first of all,
you make me sick. Okay?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.100
Second, you're lame,
and you make me sick.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.400
Third, you make me sick,
and any one of these guys...

02:25.400 --> 02:27.800
would be a better partner
than you, even Fez.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.100
Really? Then I am in.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.600
Um, no, I didn't really mean it, Fez.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.500
Oh, then I am out.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.500
Damn it. Let me in.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.100
Hangin'out

02:51.100 --> 02:53.100
Down the street

02:54.800 --> 02:56.800
The same old thing

02:58.400 --> 03:00.400
We did last week

03:01.500 --> 03:05.300
Not a thing to do

03:05.200 --> 03:08.500
But talk to you

03:08.400 --> 03:10.700
We're all all right

03:10.700 --> 03:12.700
We're all all right

03:12.700 --> 03:15.200
Hello, Wisconsin.!

03:22.200 --> 03:25.200
[TV]

03:25.200 --> 03:30.000
So, who willJackie choose
as her roller disco partner?

03:29.800 --> 03:32.600
Who, who, who?

03:32.500 --> 03:34.700
No freakin' way.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.600
Hmm, how very sad.

03:38.600 --> 03:40.600
[Sighs] No one to disco with.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.800
Now, where did I leave
my potato chips?

03:45.800 --> 03:48.600
Oh, there they are.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:01.500 --> 04:04.200
Look at that.

04:04.100 --> 04:07.200
I left my soda back
in the other side of the room!

04:24.200 --> 04:26.700
Refreshing.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.600
God, my arm is sore!

04:31.400 --> 04:33.500
Wow, Fez!

04:33.500 --> 04:37.000
Oh, come on, Jackie!

04:36.900 --> 04:39.100
You're gonna pick him
over me?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
All right. Watch this.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.000
[Grunts, Groans]

04:51.600 --> 04:54.500
Jackie, I'm just
a roller disco machine...

04:55.900 --> 04:58.900
and I don't work
for nobody but you.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.100
[Kelso Groans]

05:03.600 --> 05:06.500
Okay. Okay, fine.
We'll be partners.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.400
But hear me now.
I want first prize.

05:09.300 --> 05:12.000
If I lose and some stupid,
spoiled rich girl wins...

05:11.800 --> 05:14.400
I'll scream.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.800
[Kelso]
I am really hurt.!

05:21.200 --> 05:23.700
- Hi, sweetie. How was work?
- Oh, pretty good...

05:23.700 --> 05:27.000
except for the fact that Dad's getting sued
for firing a Price Mart employee.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.300
Okay. Well, good.
Have a cupcake.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.600
Mom, did you hear what I said?

05:33.600 --> 05:36.800
Uh-huh, and it's just so very unpleasant,
I'm ignoring it.

05:37.800 --> 05:41.100
So, have a cupcake.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
Earl is suing Dad
for wrongful termination.

05:43.900 --> 05:48.000
Earl? He didn't do his job.
He was always late.

05:47.900 --> 05:50.800
He was a complete dumb-ass...

05:52.200 --> 05:54.700
person.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.700
Mom, you said "ass."

05:58.600 --> 06:02.100
Well, now so did you.
Give me back the cupcake, foul mouth.

06:03.100 --> 06:05.100
I can't even imagine the mood
your father's in.

06:05.100 --> 06:09.000
Actually, he doesn't know yet.
I got the news after he left.

06:08.900 --> 06:12.000
God, Dad is gonna freak.
I don't know how we're gonna tell him.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
- Tell me what?
- That, uh...

06:14.800 --> 06:17.400
Mom said the "ass" word.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.200
Well, now...

06:22.200 --> 06:25.000
actually, um...

06:25.000 --> 06:27.100
Red, um-

06:27.100 --> 06:30.400
You know, Mom,
I got this one.

06:30.300 --> 06:34.400
Okay, uh, everyone here who's not being sued
by Earl for wrongful termination...

06:34.200 --> 06:36.200
raise their hand.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.800
I don't getJackie, man.

06:43.700 --> 06:48.100
I mean, picking Fez
over me? Me?

06:48.000 --> 06:50.700
I have the three things
that women want.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.300
I'm-I'm hot, and I'm smart.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.900
That's two things, moron.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.900
No, it's three.
I count hot twice.

07:03.900 --> 07:06.000
I mean, come on.
[Chuckles]

07:07.100 --> 07:10.600
Kelso, who cares?
It's a stupid roller disco thing.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.600
Yeah, I guess you're right.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.100
It's silly for me to be jealous.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.400
- You're a good friend, Donna.
- Yeah.

07:17.400 --> 07:20.700
'Cause when you think about it, I mean,
what does Fez have going for him...

07:20.600 --> 07:24.100
except an incredibly sexy accent
and an extremely hot body?

07:25.800 --> 07:29.300
Okay. Now you're being
a bad friend, Donna.

07:29.300 --> 07:32.200
I mean, come to think of it,
if Fez helps Jackie win a roller disco...

07:32.200 --> 07:35.400
she might rip his clothes off
and have sex with him right there on the rink.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.300
That's how hot he is.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.700
Bad friend, Donna! Bad!

07:45.300 --> 07:47.300
Oh, look at this guy's complaint.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.800
"Red Forman was habitually ill-tempered."
Am I ill-tempered?

07:53.900 --> 07:57.700
No, sir.
You're like Mary Poppins.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.500
Okay, honey. Well, it says here
you have to go to the labor board.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.700
You know what, Red Forman,
you have to go in there and defend yourself.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.500
[Chuckles]
I'll defend myself.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.900
I'll go in there,
and I'll tell those morons...

08:09.900 --> 08:14.000
that they're wasting my time
with this stupid crap!

08:15.400 --> 08:17.800
Or...

08:17.700 --> 08:20.200
you could control your temper.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.300
No offense, Mom, but what's plan "B"?
[Chuckles]

08:24.400 --> 08:27.200
Hey, shut it, pal.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.600
Okay, now, see, that's the kind of thing
that's gonna get you in trouble.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.400
Now, when-when I get
really angry, I just-

08:33.299 --> 08:35.900
I laugh it off... like this.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.600
- See?
- Oh, geez, Kitty. That'll never work.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.900
That's dumb.

08:51.800 --> 08:53.800
[Disco]

08:56.100 --> 08:58.100
[Ends]

09:01.200 --> 09:04.000
Oh, my God. I think
Jackie and Fez are next.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.900
Look! There they are!

09:05.900 --> 09:08.300
Hey! The next contestants
are cheaters.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.500
The brown guy is a robot.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.400
- Robot? Shut up.
- [Man On P.A.] Ladies and gentleman...

09:12.400 --> 09:14.900
welcome to the rink
our last contestants of the evening-

09:14.800 --> 09:19.100
from Point Place, Wisconsin,
Jackie Burkhart and, uh...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.400
Jackie Burkhart's Partner.!

09:21.300 --> 09:23.500
Boo!

09:24.400 --> 09:26.300
[Disco]

09:26.300 --> 09:29.000
This is so cool.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.700
- Oh, my God. They're amazing!
- Oh, did you see that? Fez just tripped.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.900
- No, he didn't.
- The foreign guy tripped.
That's a deduction right there.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.000
You're gonna lose!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.700
Kelso, shut up.

09:48.700 --> 09:51.800
That's it.
They're doing too well.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.600
[Grunts]

09:53.600 --> 09:55.600
What the hell is that?

09:55.600 --> 09:57.600
- It's my secret weapon.
- A marble?

09:57.600 --> 10:00.200
Yep. I'm gonna chuck it
out there so they trip.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.300
You moron, it's one marble.

10:03.300 --> 10:06.200
- Give me that. Give me that.
- No! No!

10:06.200 --> 10:08.100
[Singing]

10:37.800 --> 10:39.700
[Continues]

11:01.900 --> 11:04.300
[Ends]

11:12.900 --> 11:15.600
Boo! Boo!

11:15.600 --> 11:17.500
- Boo!
- Whoo!

11:17.500 --> 11:19.800
Oh, no.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.100
They were good.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.100
I swallowed my marble.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.000
Boo!

11:30.900 --> 11:33.700
- Oh, my God. You guys were so great.
- I know. I know.

11:33.600 --> 11:38.000
And even when I almost tripped,
my natural grace totally saved us.

11:37.900 --> 11:42.100
Well, I saw plenty of mistakes out there,
especially from Fez.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.700
Shut your hole.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.200
- Here come the scores.
- [Drumroll]

11:47.200 --> 11:51.600
[Man On P.A.] And the winner of Kenosha's
Annual Roller Disco Doo-dah is...

11:51.400 --> 11:54.400
- Jackie Burkhart and-
- Oh, my God!

11:54.400 --> 11:56.400
- Friend.
- Fix! Fix!

11:56.400 --> 11:58.800
I can't believe it!
I'm so sorry I doubted you.

11:58.700 --> 12:03.300
You-You are my hero-
my- my hunky, sexy, foreign skating hero!

12:03.200 --> 12:07.600
And you are my- my spoiled,
whiny skating princess.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.400
Oh, Fez, thank you!

12:11.500 --> 12:14.800
- [Gasps] Yea, champagne! Yea!
- Yea!

12:14.700 --> 12:16.600
- Yea!
- Get off me.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.400
Kelso, you booed us
the entire time.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.900
What? No!
That was some rude guy.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.800
So I popped him one,
and then I was goin', "Ooh,"

12:26.800 --> 12:29.800
because I hurt my hand
when I popped the rude guy.

12:29.700 --> 12:32.400
So... you're welcome.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.200
You wanna kiss it?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Let's go, Fez.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.600
Hmm. Come on, Kelso.
Look at the bright side.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.500
What's the bright side?

12:45.500 --> 12:47.800
The bright side is
there isn't one.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.700
Fez has Jackie, and you have
to squeeze out that marble.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.500
Now, Mr. Forman, at any point
did you ever berate Earl Arthur...

12:58.300 --> 13:00.600
by calling him
any of the following names:

13:00.600 --> 13:02.900
Candy-ass...

13:02.800 --> 13:06.000
dumb-ass, lazy-ass-

13:06.000 --> 13:08.600
Uh, it- it just goes on like that.

13:08.400 --> 13:12.200
Well, that sounds like just
good-natured ribbin' to me.

13:12.100 --> 13:15.100
- Doesn't sound that way to me.
- [Clears Throat]

13:17.700 --> 13:20.200
[Laughs]

13:24.200 --> 13:26.900
Are you callin' me a liar?

13:26.800 --> 13:30.100
'Cause it's funny if ya are.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
[Clears Throat] Well, you know, Eric worked
with him too. Eric, tell him about Earl.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.400
Actually, I'd be more interested in hearing
what Eric thinks about working with you. Eric?

13:38.300 --> 13:41.400
No. No, no, no, no.
[Chuckles] I'm-I'm here...

13:41.200 --> 13:45.000
just to answer questions
about Earl- old, dumb Earl.

13:44.900 --> 13:49.300
So, you know, you fire away
with the Earl questions.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.200
I think we know
all we need to know about Earl.

13:52.100 --> 13:56.400
Oh, then good. I'll just
step out then. Good.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.800
- This was good.
- No, no, no, no. Eric, just a few more questions.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.600
Is your father ever
unnecessarily angry?

14:13.300 --> 14:16.700
[Chuckles]
Unnecessarily angry.

14:18.500 --> 14:24.500
Well- [Clears Throat] you know,
what does "unnecessarily" mean really?

14:24.300 --> 14:27.500
I mean, my sister likes
to put salt on roast beef...

14:27.500 --> 14:29.400
but I think it's unnecessary.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.800
I mean, why cover up the flavor
of such a delicious meat?

14:31.800 --> 14:34.500
Just answer the question,
dumb-ass!

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
I mean-[Laughs]
Good work, Son.

14:46.500 --> 14:50.300
Oh, my God.
I love champagne!

14:51.300 --> 14:54.100
Yes. Was it any good?

14:54.100 --> 14:57.400
Great. Just great.

14:57.300 --> 15:01.100
[Gasps] Hey, Fez,
I just made up a poem.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
- Do you want to hear it?
- Okay.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.400
There once was
a guy named Fez...

15:07.300 --> 15:10.300
who had a really cute butt.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.500
Ta-da!

15:12.500 --> 15:14.500
Well, I have to say
I don't hate it.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.200
Hey- Psst...

15:20.700 --> 15:23.700
Fezzie...

15:23.600 --> 15:26.100
do you want to know a secret?

15:26.100 --> 15:29.600
If you try to kiss me right now...

15:29.500 --> 15:31.900
I probably wouldn't stop you.

15:31.900 --> 15:34.200
[Giggles]
In fact...

15:34.200 --> 15:36.700
I'd probably let you
do more than that.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.000
[Giggles]

15:41.400 --> 15:44.000
- Fez-
- Huh!

15:44.000 --> 15:46.100
Good God, man. Don't do it.
She is drunk.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.800
But, Batman, she is so hot.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.500
But she's drunk.
There is no honor in this.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.900
Ah, screw honor.
Take her pants off.

15:54.900 --> 15:57.600
Ay!

15:57.500 --> 15:59.700
Riddler, nefarious fiend.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.700
Don't do it, Fez.
It's a trap.

16:01.700 --> 16:06.500
Riddle me this, Fez. Why would Jackie ask you
to make out with her if she didn't want you to?

16:07.900 --> 16:10.700
Seriously, he makes
an excellent point.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.200
It's the dastardly
alcohol talking.

16:13.100 --> 16:16.800
If you and Jackie get together,
you want it to be real, not like this.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.900
Honestly, I was
rooting for you...

16:19.900 --> 16:23.600
but imaginary Batman
makes a lot of sense.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.400
Then riddle me this.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.400
What does Batman know
about girls?

16:27.400 --> 16:31.100
Slides down a pole and lives
with a teenage boy. Enough said.

16:32.100 --> 16:35.600
Okay. Now I have to say,
advantage Riddler.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.400
What are you trying
to say, Riddler?

16:38.400 --> 16:42.200
I think you know what I'm trying to say.
Ooh-la-la.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.600
Oh, you want to go,
question dork?

16:44.500 --> 16:47.000
Oh, bring it on,
bat-wuss.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.800
[Grunting]

17:00.300 --> 17:02.800
So...

17:02.800 --> 17:04.800
are you gonna kiss me, Fez?

17:05.900 --> 17:07.800
No, I am sorry, Jackie.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.099
That's okay.

17:10.099 --> 17:12.300
You still have
a very cute butt.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.800
Come on, Kelso.

17:17.800 --> 17:21.500
SoJackie likes Fez. Big deal.
You're going out with Laurie.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.500
I know. It's just, you know...

17:24.500 --> 17:28.500
seeing her with another guy just made me
remember all the good times we had together...

17:28.400 --> 17:30.700
and it just made me sad.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.900
Yeah.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.700
Come here.

17:36.700 --> 17:39.200
You know, Kelso...

17:39.200 --> 17:42.000
I guess underneath it all
you're kind of a good guy.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.800
Sometimes.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.100
Sort of.

17:46.100 --> 17:49.700
- Things'll work themselves out.
- Yeah, I know.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.400
What the hell
are you doing?

17:53.400 --> 17:56.200
We can't fight these
feelings anymore, Donna.

17:56.100 --> 17:59.100
- What?
- What? We've been doing this dance all night...

17:59.100 --> 18:01.300
and, oh, God,
I'm tired of dancing.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.700
You moron!

18:04.700 --> 18:07.400
Nobody likes a tease, Donna!

18:09.200 --> 18:13.100
I'm sorry. You're not a tease.
Come back.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.400
Tease!

18:15.400 --> 18:18.300
I'm sorry. Donna!

18:18.300 --> 18:22.100
I guess "violent"
is the wrong word...

18:22.000 --> 18:25.400
but, you know, it's definitely
some kind of rage.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.900
Although, I mean, you know,
Earl had it coming.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.800
I love you, Daddy.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.700
[Panting]
Oh, hey. Sorry I'm late.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.700
Hour and 10 minutes late.
I can only assume you're Earl.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.600
Yeah.

18:41.600 --> 18:46.600
So, um, sorry.
My, uh, dog got hit by a-

18:46.500 --> 18:49.100
a guy in a-

18:49.000 --> 18:52.100
- Car?
- [Snaps Fingers] Thanks, Red.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.600
- So, what'd I miss?
- You missed everything.

18:54.600 --> 19:00.100
Okay. I'm not gonna lie. Mr. Forman, you-
you scare the living hell out of me.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.100
- No offense.
- None taken.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.100
That's kind of his thing.
[Laughs]

19:04.100 --> 19:07.000
But, Earl, in light of your failure to show up
for your own hearing...

19:07.000 --> 19:09.700
we have no choice but to rule
in favor of Mr. Forman.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.900
- Yes, sir!
- Way to go, Dad!

19:11.000 --> 19:12.900
Damn... dog.

19:14.300 --> 19:17.700
And Mr. Forman, even though
this hearing did go your way today...

19:17.600 --> 19:19.600
in light of some
of your son's responses...

19:19.500 --> 19:23.300
I would strongly encourage you
to go to anger management classes.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.800
Sure, I'll-

19:30.800 --> 19:33.100
I'll do that.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Neat! Anger management-

19:37.000 --> 19:41.200
That sounds like it could be
kind of fun, right?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
[Laughs]

19:44.000 --> 19:46.900
We-We won. Hey!

19:46.800 --> 19:48.700
You and me-
We're such a good team.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.800
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.700
We did it.
How about us, huh?

19:54.800 --> 19:56.700
Stickin' it to the man.

19:56.700 --> 19:59.200
I'll see you at home.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.200
Wait. But, Dad, we-

20:03.200 --> 20:05.200
we drove here together.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.700
Then she fell asleep,
and I stroke her hair.

20:09.900 --> 20:13.200
You did the right thing, Fez,
but a word of advice.

20:13.100 --> 20:16.300
Next time you tell the story,
ya nailed her.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.400
Yeah, but, you know,
it's better you didn't...

20:20.400 --> 20:24.100
'cause scammin' on another guy's woman-
That's totally breaking the code.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.400
Donna told me what you did,
you dill-hole!

20:26.400 --> 20:29.100
No, she's lying!
[Shouting]

20:30.400 --> 20:32.500
Oh! That's my nipple!

20:33.800 --> 20:36.700
[Grunting, Shouting]

20:44.700 --> 20:46.900
Hello...

20:46.900 --> 20:49.100
buttercup.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.200
Fez, you're drunk.

20:50.300 --> 20:54.600
Madam, I may be drunk,
but you should have sex with me.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.700
That's crazy.

20:57.700 --> 21:00.100
But you have to, because last night...

21:00.000 --> 21:02.400
I made a big mistake.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.700
I don't even remember last night.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.600
Ay!

00:00.400 --> 00:01.900
