Bomb Squad’s going coed.

00:03.704 --> 00:06.076
I will give you until
Valentine’s assembly

00:06.076 --> 00:08.347
<i>to prove that this coed thing</i>
<i>can work.</i>

00:08.347 --> 00:10.584
That means I have two weeks.
Yes!

MAYA:
<i>I got that kick-ass job</i>
<i>at the five-star restaurant.</i>

00:14.124 --> 00:15.694
Baby, I want you
to come with me.

00:15.694 --> 00:18.599
Maya, I can’t go.
East Los is my home.

00:18.599 --> 00:20.170
This is where I belong.

00:20.170 --> 00:22.507
This is a great opportunity
for me.

00:22.507 --> 00:24.143
I can’t just
give it up.

00:24.143 --> 00:26.080
Valentine’s Day
is coming up.

Ah, there you are.

00:40.342 --> 00:43.815
Ah, you talk to Maya?

00:43.815 --> 00:46.788
No. I don’t have time.

00:46.788 --> 00:51.230
You know, maybe you should go
surprise her for Valentine’s.

00:51.230 --> 00:53.434
Pops, we broke up.

00:53.434 --> 00:55.070
You know,
you should get going

00:55.070 --> 00:56.506
if you’re gonna make it
to Bakersfield.

00:56.506 --> 00:59.178
All right, look,
I’ll be back tomorrow,

00:59.178 --> 01:02.718
in case you change your mind
and you wanna go visit

01:02.718 --> 01:06.091
and make up
with your dove.

01:06.091 --> 01:07.728
( chuckles )
Shut up.

01:07.728 --> 01:09.565
Get out. Get out.

01:09.565 --> 01:11.836
Tell Tío Jorge that I said
good luck with the new liver,

01:11.836 --> 01:13.505
and to lay off the Cuervo.

01:13.505 --> 01:15.844
HERNAN:
Yeah, fat chance.

01:19.684 --> 01:21.855
Where did you get
that shirt?

01:21.855 --> 01:25.462
My boyfriend, Santi.
He gave it to me last night.

01:25.462 --> 01:27.165
Really?

01:27.165 --> 01:29.436
Looks like he’s been giving it
to Mandy too.

01:29.436 --> 01:32.275
Maybe he gets his shirts
in bulk,

01:32.275 --> 01:33.377
just like his women.

01:35.481 --> 01:37.151
You need to straighten
your shit out.

01:41.627 --> 01:42.829
Go.

01:44.131 --> 01:46.202
Hey, what’s up, Fili?

01:46.202 --> 01:47.404
Are you with Mandy?

01:47.404 --> 01:49.742
What? No.

01:49.742 --> 01:51.546
I’m ready with you.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.817
I’m serious.
I ain’t no booty call.

01:53.817 --> 01:55.286
Whoa, Fili.

01:55.286 --> 01:56.588
Hey, I care about you,

01:56.588 --> 01:58.592
but I never said
I was gonna be exclusive.

01:58.592 --> 02:00.396
Hey, but if you wanna
convince me,

02:00.396 --> 02:01.865
I’m down for some persuasion.
( scoffs )

02:01.865 --> 02:04.137
Fili.

02:04.137 --> 02:05.439
I like your shirt.

02:06.875 --> 02:08.812
Did you make Valentine’s Day
reservations?

02:08.812 --> 02:11.752
Babe, they don’t make
reservations at IHOP.

02:11.752 --> 02:13.822
IHOP?

02:13.822 --> 02:16.794
I don’t go to the International
House of Paisas.

02:16.794 --> 02:18.731
Well, where do you
wanna go?

02:20.702 --> 02:22.806
Don’t worry about it.
I’ll take care of everything,

02:22.806 --> 02:24.509
including the limo.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.615
Just don’t forget
your credit card.

02:29.552 --> 02:30.687
Credit card?

02:32.425 --> 02:33.927
I don’t even have
a green card.

right?

I got to be
at the taqueria.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.453
All right,
I’ll talk to you later.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.556
Bye, girl.

03:41.925 --> 03:44.297
You better drop
that Boob Squad.

03:44.297 --> 03:47.803
Are you kidding? It’s the only
fun I’m having these days.

03:47.803 --> 03:49.941
Oh, sure, dancing seems
fun now,

03:49.941 --> 03:53.581
but one day you’ll wake up
all <i>tirada</i> with no money,

03:53.581 --> 03:56.353
no man and your ass fired
from your job at Litos.

03:56.353 --> 03:59.659
Uh, it’s okay, Mom.
You’ll get another job.

03:59.659 --> 04:01.563
First, you got to shower.

04:01.563 --> 04:04.703

No. I want you to study.

wanna end up...

04:16.692 --> 04:19.965
You’re not a <i>burra.</i>

together on the Bomb Squad.

04:52.628 --> 04:54.565
I worked really hard
to get us this chance.

05:03.650 --> 05:05.486
No, of course not.

05:05.486 --> 05:07.724
I’m just saying that’s what
you’re always saying.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.894
Okay, well,
it is mostly my ass,

Why are you dancing with Eddie?

But my partner’s not here.

God, not again.

Are you quitting?

Isela’s my Valentine.

09:11.827 --> 09:15.302
Oh, poor you, Isela.

09:15.302 --> 09:17.004
Better luck next year.

09:17.004 --> 09:19.008
Look, you might want to turn
down your bitch-ometer,

09:19.008 --> 09:20.912
or you’ll scare
your dude away.

09:20.912 --> 09:23.617
Be happy for me.
Stop hating.

09:23.617 --> 09:25.020
The more satisfied I am,

09:25.020 --> 09:27.692
the nicer I’ll be to you
and your playdate.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.331
Well, me and my playdate
will stay away.

09:30.331 --> 09:31.733
Come on.

09:42.854 --> 09:45.627
Damn, and here I was trying
to forget Valentine’s.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.566
Yeah.

09:48.566 --> 09:49.968
Me too.

09:49.968 --> 09:52.106
But it’s good
for business.

09:53.943 --> 09:56.214
So have you heard
from Maya?

09:56.214 --> 09:59.052
Uh, she’s been texting.

09:59.052 --> 10:01.223
And have you replied?

10:01.223 --> 10:03.360
No.

10:03.360 --> 10:06.801
So how are my boys doing
on Bomb Squad?

10:06.801 --> 10:08.671
Omar and Luis are great.

10:08.671 --> 10:10.274
No, seriously,
they’re kicking ass.

10:10.274 --> 10:11.677
Yeah.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.012
That’s good.

10:13.012 --> 10:15.016
I’m excited to see them
perform today.

10:15.016 --> 10:16.953
It might be the first
and last time.

10:16.953 --> 10:19.693
Miss A wants to kill the Bomb
Squad, because there’s no funds.

10:19.693 --> 10:22.097
That sucks.
You’ll be out of a job.

10:22.097 --> 10:23.800

10:23.800 --> 10:25.136

Oh, my gosh.

11:13.363 --> 11:15.867
I wonder who they’re from.

11:15.867 --> 11:18.138
From me. You said I had
to send you something.

11:18.138 --> 11:20.944

Did somebody die?

11:20.944 --> 11:23.382

11:23.382 --> 11:25.051

11:25.051 --> 11:27.356
Yeah, she is.

11:27.356 --> 11:29.259
Eddie’s a good guy.

11:31.130 --> 11:32.432
He’s taken.

11:32.432 --> 11:34.102
I know.

11:34.102 --> 11:36.807
Girl, you gotta have
more self-respect.

11:36.807 --> 11:38.277
I mean, if something’s
meant to be,

11:38.277 --> 11:40.080
then you don’t have
to work hard for it

11:40.080 --> 11:41.684
or chase after it.

11:41.684 --> 11:43.688
SANTI: Hey, Fili.
Yes, Santi?

12:00.888 --> 12:03.058
Except...
What?

12:03.058 --> 12:05.029
Lorena.
Who?

12:05.029 --> 12:08.736
Pops, we gotta let her go.

12:08.736 --> 12:10.907
Don’t look at me.

12:10.907 --> 12:12.810
You hire her, you fire her.

12:12.810 --> 12:14.781
Yeah, but I just can’t
fire her. She’s--

12:14.781 --> 12:16.450
You know,
she’s Gina’s mom.

12:16.450 --> 12:17.921

12:42.802 --> 12:44.939
Listen, um, you got a minute?

12:44.939 --> 12:46.843
I think we need to talk.

12:46.843 --> 12:51.251
Oh, the big <i>jefe</i>
wants to talk to me.

12:51.251 --> 12:53.389
Jacob, can you cover for me?

12:57.797 --> 12:59.467
JACOB:
That’s all I’ve been doing.

13:02.306 --> 13:05.145
CECI:
Happy Valentine’s Day, everyone.

13:05.145 --> 13:06.948

13:08.318 --> 13:11.189
I just have a few announcements
to make.

13:11.189 --> 13:15.398
Our student council elections
will be next Thursday,

13:15.398 --> 13:17.402
so don’t forget to read up
on the bios

13:17.402 --> 13:19.139

13:19.139 --> 13:21.510

you’ve all been waiting for:

virginity very seriously,

start something

we were going to IHOP.

there’s that.

17:13.457 --> 17:15.528
IHOP? Carnations?

17:15.528 --> 17:18.666
I just don’t think we want
the same things.

17:18.666 --> 17:21.472
Well, if that’s how you feel--

17:21.472 --> 17:22.975
We both deserve
to be with somebody

17:22.975 --> 17:24.545
that we have
a connection with.

17:24.545 --> 17:27.417

17:28.686 --> 17:31.057
I’m sorry. I just--
