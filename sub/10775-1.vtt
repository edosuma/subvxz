crumbling of the Berlin Wall'

02:14.501 --> 02:16.366
There were many heroes in this battle'

02:16.436 --> 02:20.532
but to Charlie Wilson must
go this special recognition.

02:21.941 --> 02:25.968
Just 13 years ago' the Soviet
Army appeared to be invincible.

02:26.913 --> 02:29.973
But Charlie' undeterred'

02:30.049 --> 02:32.142
engineered a lethal body blow

02:32.218 --> 02:34.709
that weakened the Communist empire.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.618
Without Charlie'

02:36.689 --> 02:40.955
history would be hugely
and sadly different.

02:41.761 --> 02:43.228
And so' for the first time'

a civilian is being given
our highest recognition'

CRYSTAL: That's right.

03:22.602 --> 03:23.591
You know what I'm saying?

03:23.670 --> 03:25.228
Like Dallas but set in Washington.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.102
Yeah.And you should
say it just like that.

03:27.173 --> 03:28.606
When I pitch it. You
should say it just...

03:28.675 --> 03:31.269
"Oh, this is fucking great."
You should say it just like that.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.039
Dallas set in Washington D.C.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.478
You know, with the
intrigue and the power plays

03:35.548 --> 03:37.175
and the overt natural sex.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.649
The glamour, the power.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.618
CRYSTAL: Do you know what I'm
saying? PAUL: It's fucking Dallas.

03:40.687 --> 03:41.915
CRYSTAL: Or, or Falcon Crest.

03:41.988 --> 03:42.977
Yes.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.250
That's set in Washington.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.916
Say it to Charlie like that.

03:45.992 --> 03:49.155
The resistance fighters
disguised us as one of them.

03:49.395 --> 03:50.623
Charlie.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.255
(CLEARS THROAT)

03:52.332 --> 03:55.130
It's like Dallas but in Washington.

03:55.201 --> 03:56.395
With Crystal in the starring role.

03:56.469 --> 03:57.458
Yeah.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.937
You tell me when to watch.
I'll make sure I'm home.

04:00.006 --> 04:01.598
You don't think I can make it happen?

04:01.674 --> 04:03.767
I don't know anything
about how any of that works.

04:03.843 --> 04:06.004
I do. You said that
you would listen to him.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.239
That's why we're here.

04:07.313 --> 04:09.781
Do they routinely give starring
roles on network programs

04:09.849 --> 04:12.079
to people who haven't
acted professionally before?

04:12.151 --> 04:14.381
She was just on he fucking
cover of Playboy' Charlie.

04:14.454 --> 04:16.149
Well, I guess that's
just the same thing.

04:16.221 --> 04:17.985
Would you take this seriously, please?

04:18.057 --> 04:20.286
I am taking it seriously, hon,
but can you all tell me something?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.294
What is... What is Dan
Rather wearing right now?

04:22.362 --> 04:23.920
What? Dan Rather.

04:23.997 --> 04:24.986
What is he wearing?

04:25.064 --> 04:26.053
You're watching TV?

04:26.132 --> 04:27.156
Why hasn't he shaved?

04:27.233 --> 04:28.530
Well, who gives a damn?

04:28.601 --> 04:31.934
Excuse me! Hey! Excuse
me, could you turn that up?

04:32.005 --> 04:34.906
Could you just turn up
the volume on the TV?

04:34.974 --> 04:36.441
Oh, I'm completely high.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.067
Yeah. Okay.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.305
Still, could you just
grab the remote there

04:40.380 --> 04:42.678
and find the volume button?

04:42.749 --> 04:44.307
Charlie, are we gonna do business?

04:44.384 --> 04:47.478
Dan Rather is wearing a turban,
Paul. Don't you want to know why?

04:47.553 --> 04:50.852
He's doing a thing from India.

04:50.923 --> 04:52.948
No, that's Afghanistan. Got it.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.721
Appreciate it. WOMAN TRANSLATOR.:
We got it... We captured it

04:54.794 --> 04:56.318
from the Afghan' the
Afghan army. Thank you.

04:56.396 --> 04:57.954
Does he have ammunition
for this? He has three.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.999
But does he have ammunition?
A lot of ammunition?

05:00.066 --> 05:01.761
Well, he's talking about the mujahideen.

05:01.834 --> 05:02.960

we didn't capture any.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.128
PAUL: Priests?

05:04.203 --> 05:07.798
No, mujahideen means,
like, holy warriors.

And he was... He is saying that'
you know' America seems to be asleep.

05:16.349 --> 05:19.375
It doesn't seem to realize
that if Afghanistan goes

05:19.452 --> 05:21.511
and the Russians go over to the Gulf'

05:21.587 --> 05:23.851
that in a very short time'

05:23.923 --> 05:26.221
it's going to be the turn
of the United States as well.

05:26.292 --> 05:28.556
DAN.: I'm sure he
knows that in Vietnam...

05:28.628 --> 05:29.959
Excuse me.

05:30.963 --> 05:33.397
We were just wondering
what you do for a living.

05:33.466 --> 05:36.128
I'm not a police officer,
if that's what you're asking.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.763
No. We just... We don't meet a lot
of guys here who both, you know,

05:39.839 --> 05:41.602
know about the world and like to party.

I'm sorry?

05:46.846 --> 05:48.313
I'm a Congressman.

05:48.381 --> 05:49.848
Are you kidding?

05:49.916 --> 05:52.316
No. No, I'm absolutely serious.

05:52.385 --> 05:56.219
I'm Charlie Wilson. I represent
the Texas Second Congressional.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.586
Texas. And this is Crystal Lee.

06:02.862 --> 06:03.886
Stacey. Stacey.

Kelly. Kelly. Well, it's
nice to meet you both.

06:06.966 --> 06:12.131
If you are a Congressman should you
be in here with strippers and blow?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.673
Hey, I'm not a stripper.

06:14.741 --> 06:15.935
I am a stripper.

06:16.008 --> 06:17.270
I'm a stripper.

06:17.343 --> 06:19.334
Yes, see, they were
talking about themselves.

06:19.412 --> 06:22.006
You know, you do have a point there.

06:22.081 --> 06:24.481
I really should get
going. A little pruney.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.610
Look, Charlie, I need
$29,000 to make it happen.

06:27.687 --> 06:30.451
And you know I can make it happen,
and you know you want in on this.

06:30.523 --> 06:33.822
Hey, who wants to take a
ride with me to the airport?

06:33.893 --> 06:35.087
Oh, me! Paul?

Okay.

DAN ON TV.: ...a holy
war against the Soviets.

06:39.532 --> 06:42.990
A war they say that'
if they get weapons'

06:43.069 --> 06:46.732
from us or anyone else in
the free world' they will win.

Charles Wilson and Crystal Lee.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.574
CHARLIE: I wish he wouldn't
do that. From Texas.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.376
Has there ever been a
show about Washington?

06:56.449 --> 06:57.814
I don't think there has. Me, neither.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.546
Thank you. We got the
suite another night. Comped.

DRIVER: Should I go back? No.

07:02.455 --> 07:03.922
You can't stay another night? No. No.

07:03.990 --> 07:04.979
Stay another night.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.388
I can't. I have a vote.

07:06.459 --> 07:07.687
What, an important one?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.728
Yes. What is it?

07:09.796 --> 07:11.388
Well, it's a non-binding resolution

07:11.464 --> 07:13.489
expressing the sense of the Congress

07:13.566 --> 07:16.626
that the Department of Defense should
continue to exercise its authority

07:16.702 --> 07:19.034
to support the Boy Scouts of America.

07:19.105 --> 07:20.299
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:21.107 --> 07:23.473
Come on, Charlie, call, raise or fold.

07:23.543 --> 07:24.703
I want to get an answer on this thing

07:24.777 --> 07:25.766
that Crystal and I want to do.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.836
First off, I'd appreciate it

07:27.914 --> 07:30.041
if you didn't throw my
name around quite so much,

07:30.116 --> 07:33.608
'cause, from time to time, I use it
myself, and I need it in good condition.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.847
Second, I'm from Lufkin, Texas.

07:35.922 --> 07:37.753
I'm the son of an accountant
for a timber company.

07:37.824 --> 07:41.692
I take home about 700 bucks
a week, and I pay alimony,

07:41.761 --> 07:45.720
so the idea that I got $29,000
in the bank is pretty hysterical.

07:46.232 --> 07:47.927
That said, I love your idea.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.934
Crys, I'll call you this week. Okay.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.060
All right.

07:51.137 --> 07:55.267
Stacey, Kelly, nice to meet you
both. Are you Nevada residents?

07:55.341 --> 07:56.808
BOTH: Yeah. Well, don't forget to vote.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.673
Bye. We love you! We love you!

07:58.744 --> 08:00.803
Oh, it helps not to know
me. Oh! That is for you.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.074
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.615
Bye! Bye, Charlie.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.674
CHARLIE: I love Las Vegas!

08:06.285 --> 08:07.309
CHARLIE: All right, what else?

08:07.386 --> 08:08.751
That Dairy Queen guy, Larry Liddle,

08:08.821 --> 08:10.288
is sitting in your office. Hey.

08:10.356 --> 08:11.880
Yeah, I told him he could come in.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.755
He wants to talk to
you about a crššche.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.794
What, a nativity scene with baby Jesus?

08:15.862 --> 08:18.023
Yeah, it's on public property,
and the city's making him move it.

08:18.097 --> 08:19.655
Shit. I thought he was just coming in

08:19.732 --> 08:21.563
to get his picture took,
you know? Congressman.

08:21.634 --> 08:22.896
Yeah? You're exactly
who I need to speak to.

08:22.969 --> 08:23.958
You have a moment? Sure.

08:24.036 --> 08:25.833
Tip asked me to talk to you. Okay.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.770
He wanted me to talk to
you about John Murtha.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.468
Go ahead. The prosecutor's
gonna go after him.

08:30.543 --> 08:31.976
Well, they ain't gonna find anything.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.308
John Murtha's as clean as
my mother's kitchen floor.

08:34.380 --> 08:35.779
Yeah, but Tip would like to put you

08:35.847 --> 08:37.405
on the Ethics Committee just the same.

08:37.482 --> 08:39.178
You're kidding. No.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.379
Well, Jesus, Donnelly,
everyone in town knows

08:41.453 --> 08:42.784
I'm on the other side of that issue.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.948
Ethics? Yeah!

08:45.024 --> 08:47.925
Well, the Speaker would like to
put you on the committee anyway.

08:47.994 --> 08:51.521
Okay. Well, if anyone asks what the
hell I'm doing on the Ethics Committee,

08:51.597 --> 08:54.327
we'll just tell them I like
chasing women and drinking whiskey

08:54.400 --> 08:56.527
and the Speaker felt we
were underrepresented.

08:56.602 --> 08:58.263
One man, one vote. Exactly.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.702
Tip's gonna want to return the favor.

08:59.772 --> 09:01.706
Tuesday, right? That is Tuesday, yes.

09:01.774 --> 09:03.332
So if anything comes
up that you'd like me

09:03.409 --> 09:04.501
to speak with him about, please...

09:04.577 --> 09:05.635
Yes.

09:06.112 --> 09:07.170
Yes!

09:07.713 --> 09:10.341
I'd like to be on the Board of
Directors of the Kennedy Center.

09:10.449 --> 09:11.473
Charlie. I'm sorry?

09:11.551 --> 09:14.543
Turns out Congress appoints the Board
of Directors of the Kennedy Center.

09:14.620 --> 09:18.556
It's a great place to take a date,
and I can never afford the tickets.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.489
Consider it done. Excellent.

09:21.494 --> 09:22.518
Go vote.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.564
Another few minutes. Let's
see what's on the wires.

09:25.631 --> 09:28.327
Why can't you wait for
newspapers like everybody else?

09:28.401 --> 09:30.665
'Cause I think it's productive
to know today's news today.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.296
And it makes me one day smarter
than you, which I enjoy as well.

09:33.372 --> 09:34.862
I know you do.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.408
You don't think that's a little crazy?

09:36.475 --> 09:38.636
Pan Am and Eastern are
lowering their fares.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.576
'Cause of Braniff.
What's a little crazy?

09:40.646 --> 09:42.079
Joining the Board of the Kennedy Center

09:42.148 --> 09:44.082
so you can get free tickets
to the Royal Ballet of...

Hold on. What?

09:45.318 --> 09:47.047

09:47.119 --> 09:48.484
Uzbekistan?

09:48.688 --> 09:50.087
Afghanistan.

09:50.890 --> 09:54.348
Russia, Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,

09:54.427 --> 09:56.292
Jordan, Israel, Egypt.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.290
Jim Van Wagenen's our
point man on black approps

10:01.367 --> 10:02.732
for the Defense Subcommittee?

10:02.802 --> 10:03.860
Yeah.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.166
Have him come to my
office as soon as possible.

10:06.238 --> 10:07.705
How am I voting on this? BONNIE: Yes.

10:07.773 --> 10:08.933
You sure? Yes.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.498
The Boy Scouts?

10:10.576 --> 10:13.170
Jim Van Wagenen. Get him
and show him that wire story.

10:13.245 --> 10:15.076
Yes, sir. You are the
man I wanted to talk to.

10:16.983 --> 10:18.245
The Congressman will
be here in a moment.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.012
He's just coming up from a vote.

10:20.086 --> 10:21.553
I'm sure it's an important one.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.747
No. Not really.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.246
SUZANNE: So, Marla, can you fit
this into his schedule next week?

10:25.324 --> 10:26.313
(PHONE RINGING)

10:26.392 --> 10:28.053
RECEPTIONIST: Charlie
Wilson's office. Good morning.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.287
The third...

10:29.362 --> 10:31.592
It is? How are you?

10:31.664 --> 10:32.961
BONNIE: Suzanne, can you
help me with this? Okay.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.863
SUZANNE: I'll be right back.
RECEPTIONIST: I'll have him do it.

10:34.934 --> 10:35.923
Okay, bye-bye.

10:36.002 --> 10:37.367
LARRY: Miss? Yes, sir?

10:37.436 --> 10:41.702
It seems to me, looking around, that
it's almost all women working here,

10:41.774 --> 10:44.174
and that they're all very pretty.

10:44.410 --> 10:45.399
Is that common?

10:45.478 --> 10:46.570
(LAUGHS) Well,

10:46.646 --> 10:48.876
Congressman Wilson,
he has an expression.

10:48.948 --> 10:53.612
He says, "You can teach them to type,
but you can't teach them to grow tits."

10:53.853 --> 10:55.218
Well, that's charming.

10:55.287 --> 10:56.982
Larry! Congressman!

10:57.056 --> 11:00.890
No, no, no. For $5,000 every two
years you get to call me Charlie.

11:00.960 --> 11:04.828
And for 10,000, you can call me Betty
Sue and I'll clean out your rain gutters.

11:04.897 --> 11:05.921
This is my daughter, Jane.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.260
Well, now I remember
Jane. Two-L at SMU.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.925
Charlie Wilson's office. Good morning.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.628
Welcome to the United States Congress.

11:10.703 --> 11:13.035
Hey, I'm gonna talk to your
daddy for a couple of seconds.

11:13.105 --> 11:15.266
Larry, can we get you a drink?

11:15.341 --> 11:16.569
It's 10:00 in the morning.

11:16.642 --> 11:18.803
Well, fair enough, I guess.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.144
Grab a seat.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.850
Now, this situation with the
crššche, I want to know all about it.

11:24.917 --> 11:25.906
Well, sir,

11:25.985 --> 11:26.974
(CLEARS THROAT)

11:27.520 --> 11:30.512
every single year since
the world was young,

11:31.323 --> 11:35.191
the firehouse in the Nacogdoches
Township has displayed a crššche.

11:35.261 --> 11:38.697
Now, the ACLU has filed
suit against the township

11:38.764 --> 11:42.256
for displaying a religious
symbol on public property.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.495
It's Christmas time. It's a crššche.

11:44.570 --> 11:47.300
I could understand if we
were in gosh-darn Scarsdale,

11:47.373 --> 11:51.002
but this is east Texas, and I
want to know who we're offending.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.908
Except two lawyers from the ACLU.

11:52.978 --> 11:56.414
That is a terribly interesting
and complicated question.

11:56.482 --> 11:58.313
Let me make this suggestion, though.

11:58.384 --> 12:01.217
There's a church about
a block and a half

12:01.287 --> 12:04.222
from that firehouse, First
Baptist Church of Nacogdoches.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.986
They've got a beautiful
rolling lawn out there in front.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.856
No, no. This is a
Christian country, Charlie,

12:08.928 --> 12:10.896
founded on Christian values. Sure.

12:10.963 --> 12:13.022
We welcome other faiths
to worship as they wish,

12:13.099 --> 12:15.465
but when you can't put a nativity scene

12:15.534 --> 12:18.628
in front of a firehouse at Christmas
time in Nacogdoches Township,

12:18.704 --> 12:20.137
something's gone terribly wrong.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.299
Well, that's not really true, Larry.

12:22.374 --> 12:24.968
You could move that
crššche over to that church

12:25.044 --> 12:26.033
and everything's just fine.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.306
That's not the point!

12:27.379 --> 12:30.507
Okay. Why don't we just
start back at the beginning?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.777
What can I do for you?

12:31.851 --> 12:34.012
You can intervene in the case
against the crššche committee.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.280
Intervene? How?

12:35.354 --> 12:36.878
You appointed the judge.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.253
I don't appoint judges.

12:38.324 --> 12:40.189
I just made a recommendation
to the President.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.283
Uh-huh.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.657
I think you and I both
know what that means.

12:42.728 --> 12:43.752
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

12:43.829 --> 12:46.662
I cannot just call up a
judge and tell him what to do.

12:46.732 --> 12:48.632
Why? Well, 'cause
it's against a shitload

12:48.701 --> 12:50.965
of really good laws, Gary.

12:51.036 --> 12:52.799
Larry. Larry.

12:52.872 --> 12:57.866
I got to go talk to this guy out
here for a second. Will you excuse me?

12:57.943 --> 12:59.137
By the way, I love Jesus Christ

12:59.211 --> 13:00.838
and his mother Mary as much as anybody.

13:00.913 --> 13:04.508
About 38 churches you could move
that crššche to, everybody lives.

13:04.683 --> 13:05.741
Give me a call. Okay.

13:05.818 --> 13:07.012
I love Chivas.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.849
Jane, how are you?

13:08.921 --> 13:10.548
You need a cup of coffee?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.989
Something to drink? Anything
like that? Okay. Mmm-mmm.

13:13.058 --> 13:14.855
Jim. Congressman.

13:14.927 --> 13:16.827
You see Lederer's AP story out of Kabul?

13:16.896 --> 13:18.363
Yeah. We're reading
this story every day now.

13:18.430 --> 13:19.454
You see Dan Rather last night?

13:19.532 --> 13:21.022
Yeah. I did.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.398
Tell me something. What is the
Defense Subcommittee's budget

13:23.469 --> 13:25.596
for covert ops against the
Communists in Afghanistan?

13:25.671 --> 13:26.865
All in? All in.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.531
It's 5 million.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.305
Well, they can't shoot down
helicopters for $5 million, Jim.

13:33.379 --> 13:36.780
Though they're trying to. Which
is more than I can say for us.

13:36.849 --> 13:38.612
Get everybody together
for me, would you?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.308
And double it.

13:40.386 --> 13:41.819
RECEPTIONIST: Charlie Wilson's office.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.684
Okay, I'm sorry, sir?

13:43.956 --> 13:46.015
The covert ops budget. Double it.

13:46.091 --> 13:47.353
(RECEPTIONIST CHATTERING)

13:48.327 --> 13:49.419
Okay.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.123
This ain't gonna be much longer, okay?

13:53.299 --> 13:54.323
(PHONE RINGING)

13:54.400 --> 13:56.561
Here's what I'm gonna do, Larry.

13:56.635 --> 13:58.603
RECEPTIONIST: Charlie Wilson's office.

14:00.906 --> 14:04.808
Maybe in about 20 minutes.
He's just going into a meeting.

14:04.877 --> 14:05.969
Sure.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.173
My XO wrote in a report,

14:09.248 --> 14:13.651
I was the best officer he
ever served at sea with,

14:13.719 --> 14:17.849
and the worst officer he
ever served in port with.

14:17.923 --> 14:20.016
(LAUGHS) You can look it up.

14:20.092 --> 14:22.686
I must've graduated from Annapolis

14:22.761 --> 14:25.286
with the second most
demerits of any midshipman

14:25.364 --> 14:27.161
in the history of the Naval Academy.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.724
JANE: Well, who had the most?
I want to sleep with him.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.235
(ANGEL OF THE MORNING PLAYING ON STEREO)

14:31.303 --> 14:35.137
It's hotter here in
D.C. than in Nacogdoches,

14:35.207 --> 14:38.768
so I hope you don't mind, I
took off a few of my clothes.

14:38.844 --> 14:42.007
Well, I'm just gonna have
to live with that, Jane.

14:42.147 --> 14:48.347
(SINGING) Just call me
angel of the morning' angel

14:48.420 --> 14:51.981
Just touch my cheek before you leave me

14:52.057 --> 14:54.890
Come on over here. I'm gonna show
you the best view in the District.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.018
You want some of this?

14:56.095 --> 14:57.255
No, no, I got this.

14:57.329 --> 14:58.660
I like both.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.824
Well, it must be great being me.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.527
I've heard it is.

15:03.602 --> 15:05.729
Iwo Jima Memorial.

15:05.804 --> 15:07.328
There's the Lincoln.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.931
Washington. Now follow
it around to the right.

15:10.009 --> 15:13.877
CHARLIE: The Jefferson
Memorial. The Arlington Bridge.

15:13.946 --> 15:16.881
And there's the Pentagon.

15:16.949 --> 15:18.348
Oh, that's the Pentagon.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.543
That's the Pentagon.

15:19.618 --> 15:23.520
How about I show you the second
best view in the District?

15:23.589 --> 15:25.648
Why, Jane, would you like...

15:25.724 --> 15:26.713
(PHONE RINGING)

15:27.526 --> 15:28.515
(SIGHS)

15:28.761 --> 15:29.955
Well, that was predictable.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.124
Just give me one second.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.267
Hello? WOMAN.: That was
an extraordinary thing

15:36.335 --> 15:37.825
you did today.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.259
Who is this?

15:39.338 --> 15:40.396
It's Joanne.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.967
Joanne!

15:42.708 --> 15:44.903
Why, gosh, how nice to hear from you.

15:44.977 --> 15:46.808
Could I call you back in a little bit?

15:46.879 --> 15:49.006
Is Ronald Reagan in
your bedroom right now?

15:49.081 --> 15:51.140
No.Then I'm considerably more important

15:51.216 --> 15:53.184
than whoever is. Is anything wrong?

15:53.252 --> 15:55.982
This is gonna take just a second or two.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.585
Okay, I'm all yours.

15:59.058 --> 16:02.926
What did I do that was so extraordinary?

16:02.995 --> 16:04.155
"Double it. "

16:04.229 --> 16:06.026
'Cause I was told you
didn't have a girlfriend.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.087
What?

16:07.166 --> 16:09.157
You told Jim Van Wagenen to double it.

16:09.234 --> 16:12.533
Well, shit, Joanne, I don't
know what you're talking about,

16:12.604 --> 16:14.970
and if I did, it'd be classified,

16:15.240 --> 16:16.707
and I'd wonder where
you got your information

16:16.775 --> 16:17.799
on the Subcommittee.

16:17.876 --> 16:19.173
Oh' what do you care' hon?

16:19.244 --> 16:22.975
It's a little matter of national
security and I can't help but think...

16:23.048 --> 16:25.107
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

16:25.184 --> 16:26.776
Hold on.I am sorry,

16:26.852 --> 16:28.877
but I was told you
didn't have a girlfriend.

16:28.954 --> 16:30.387
I don't. This isn't my girlfriend.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.947
It's the sixth
wealthiest woman in Texas.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.788
Which is still pretty good.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.088
Okay, so, hi.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.755
A friend of mine has made a
terrific movie about the need

16:38.831 --> 16:40.958
for American aid to Afghanistan.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.591
He's made a movie? Yes.

16:42.668 --> 16:46.502
I'm gonna run this movie Friday
night at my house at a fundraiser.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.802
You know' you've never
been to my house' Charlie.

16:48.874 --> 16:51.809
You want me to come to
Houston and see a movie?

16:51.877 --> 16:55.040
There'll be women and wealthy
donors. See you Friday.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.479
Yes, ma'am.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.879
Hey.

17:03.956 --> 17:04.944
Mmm-mmm.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.082
Hey. Mmm-mmm.

17:12.631 --> 17:13.689
Thank you, Joanne.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.791
Okay. I know it was difficult for
you to come in here, hat in hand.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.864
That's not the kind of upbringing,
I guess, is the word I'm looking for.

17:22.941 --> 17:25.704
It's not the kind of man
you are. I understand that.

17:25.778 --> 17:28.975
I'm not looking to humiliate
you or exact a price in any way,

17:29.048 --> 17:30.948
so why don't you just apologize?

17:31.016 --> 17:33.507
We'll call it water under the dam,
and we'll go about our business.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.576
Excuse me, what the fuck?

17:36.522 --> 17:38.513
What? What the fuck
are you talking about?

17:38.590 --> 17:40.558
Clair George said you were
coming in here to apologize.

17:40.626 --> 17:43.151
No, I'm supposed to come in here
so you could apologize to me.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.991
According to whom? Clair George.

17:45.064 --> 17:48.033
You told me to go fuck myself.
I'm supposed to apologize to you?

17:48.100 --> 17:51.194
Also, water goes over a dam and
under a bridge, you poncy schoolboy.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.569
Clearly there's been a miscommunication
between Clair George and somebody.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.834
Excuse me. Yes?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.170
Does this look all right? It's fine.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.334
Thank you. I can sand it down a little.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.605
I, I don't know. I have no
fucking idea who this guy is.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.409
He is here to fix the glass that you
broke the last time you were here.

18:03.482 --> 18:05.973
Could you just excuse us
for a second there? Yes.

18:06.051 --> 18:07.075
You tell me to go fuck myself

18:07.152 --> 18:08.710
and I'm supposed to
apologize? You break my window,

18:08.787 --> 18:10.687
I'm supposed to apologize?
The Helsinki job was mine!

18:10.756 --> 18:13.384
The Helsinki job was not yours. If
it was yours, you'd be in Helsinki.

18:13.459 --> 18:14.892
Alan Wolfe stood in
this office! Alan Wolfe

18:14.960 --> 18:16.484
is no longer the Director.
Yeah, it was on the books!

18:16.562 --> 18:19.360
Alan Wolfe is no longer the
Director of European Operations.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.796
He does not make those
appointments. I do.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.561
Promises were made. Not by me.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.932
I've been with the company for 24 years.

18:25.003 --> 18:26.937
I was posted in Greece for 15.

18:27.005 --> 18:30.771
Papandreou wins that election if I
don't help the junta take him prisoner.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.743
I've advised and armed
the Hellenic army.

18:32.811 --> 18:34.745
I've neutralized champions of Communism.

18:34.813 --> 18:38.112
I've spent the past three
years learning Finnish!

18:38.183 --> 18:40.151
Which should come in
handy here in Virginia!

18:40.219 --> 18:42.187
And I'm never, ever, sick at sea.

18:42.254 --> 18:45.655
So I want to know why I'm not gonna
be your Helsinki station chief.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.521
You're coarse. Excuse me?

18:47.626 --> 18:50.186
For Helsinki, I need someone
with diplomatic skills.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.490
You don't have them.Is that right?

18:51.563 --> 18:53.588
That is right. And I don't know
why the hell I didn't fire you

18:53.665 --> 18:54.757
when you broke my fucking window!

18:54.833 --> 18:56.698
Oh, yes, sure you do, Cravely.

18:56.768 --> 18:58.827
Look, Gust... Yeah, you're
fucking Roger's fiancee

18:58.904 --> 19:00.201
and you know I know.

19:01.773 --> 19:04.003
I'm not... I'm not even gonna
dignify that with a response.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.010
Yeah, yeah, you're
dignifying her in the ass

19:06.078 --> 19:08.012
at the Jefferson Hotel, room 1 210.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.981
But let me ask you. The
3,000 agents Turner fired

19:11.049 --> 19:13.244
was that because they lacked
diplomatic skills as well?

19:13.318 --> 19:15.183
You're referring to
Admiral Stansfield Turner?

19:15.254 --> 19:16.312
Yeah, the 3,000 agents.

19:16.388 --> 19:19.323
Each and every goddamn one of them
first or second generation Americans.

19:19.391 --> 19:21.882
Is that because they lack
the proper diplomatic skills?

19:21.960 --> 19:24.428
Or did Turner not think it
was a good idea to have spies

19:24.496 --> 19:27.829
who could speak the same language as
the people they're fucking spying on?

19:27.900 --> 19:30.425
Well, I'm sorry, but you
can hardly blame the Director

19:30.502 --> 19:33.494
for questioning the loyalty to America
of people that are just barely Americans

19:33.572 --> 19:35.563
in the first place. Yeah,
well, I'd like to take a moment

19:35.641 --> 19:37.233
to review the several ways
in which you're a douchebag.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.368
Get the fuck out of my office! Yes, sir.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.741
Before I end your career, asshole.

19:40.812 --> 19:41.836
Yes, sir!

19:41.914 --> 19:45.042
Yeah, my friend, I'm gonna
need you for a second.

19:45.617 --> 19:46.606
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

19:46.952 --> 19:48.317
God damn it!

19:48.787 --> 19:50.152
My loyalty?

19:51.023 --> 19:53.651
For 24 years, people have
been trying to kill me.

19:53.725 --> 19:55.090
People who know how.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.152
Now, do you think that's because
my dad was a Greek soda pop maker

19:58.230 --> 20:00.630
or do you think that's
because I'm an American spy?

20:00.699 --> 20:03.224
Go fuck yourself,you fucking child.

20:09.408 --> 20:10.773
How was I?

20:11.777 --> 20:12.869
Thank you.

20:13.845 --> 20:17.372
There's a woman in Aliquippa,
Pennsylvania, named Nitsa.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.641
And she thinks she's a witch.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.118
Yeah, she offered to put
a curse on Cravely for me.

20:22.187 --> 20:23.279
Yeah?

20:23.455 --> 20:24.683
And she...

20:25.257 --> 20:29.091
She asked me do I want a
professional curse or a health curse.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.256
"If it's a health curse,
I can do it right away,

20:31.330 --> 20:34.026
"but a professional curse takes longer."

20:34.099 --> 20:37.159
Well, I'm living proof
she's right about that.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.531
Did you get the brownie?
Oh, no, sir, I didn't.

20:39.605 --> 20:40.936
I got you.

20:43.008 --> 20:46.205
I'm reading transcripts
of phone conversations

20:46.278 --> 20:47.973
between French and German generals

20:48.046 --> 20:51.413
arguing over office
space at NATO headquarters

20:51.483 --> 20:55.214
and analyzing wiretaps out
of Mercury Bay, New Zealand.

20:55.287 --> 20:58.916
You know, historically, a
hotbed of anti-American activity.

20:59.625 --> 21:02.788
Yeah, nobody will come
near me. I'm in the weeds.

21:03.829 --> 21:06.229
You know, a typical case officer

21:06.598 --> 21:11.297
doesn't walk into his boss's office
and tell him to go fuck himself. Twice.

21:11.370 --> 21:14.032
I just told you, I paid a
witch in Pennsylvania $80

21:14.106 --> 21:16.802
to put a curse on Henry Cravely for me.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.570
Do I sound like a
typical case officer? No.

21:19.645 --> 21:22.375
Well, then,let's assume I'm not.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.608
Listen. If you're really
not doing anything,

21:24.683 --> 21:26.275
why don't you come
upstairs and work with us?

21:26.351 --> 21:27.477
What are you doing?

21:27.552 --> 21:28.985
Killing Russians.

21:30.355 --> 21:34.587
Our next slave girl is a Texas
rose named Ashley Rensler.

21:34.660 --> 21:35.684
(CROWD CHEERING)

21:35.761 --> 21:39.458
Ashley is prelaw at U. T.'
and her three sorority sisters

21:39.531 --> 21:42.591
from Delta Delta Delta
will wash your car or truck

21:42.668 --> 21:45.762
in special outfits they
have chosen for the occasion.

21:45.837 --> 21:50.331
So' who wants their wheels cleaned clean
as a whistle by a 19-year-old lawyer

21:50.409 --> 21:52.570
and her three friends from Tri-Delt?

21:52.644 --> 21:53.633
(CROWD CHEERING)

21:53.712 --> 21:56.545
I have 10'000' who'll give
me 1 1? 1 1' 1 1' I got 1 1.

21:56.615 --> 21:58.515
I got 15 right here.
Thank you very much.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.847
Oh, my God, she is a Minute Woman.

22:00.919 --> 22:02.716
No, she's a Tri-Delt.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.520
No, she is a Minute Woman, Charlie.

22:05.590 --> 22:06.852
Oh. Joanne.

22:06.925 --> 22:10.759
Yeah, she's a direct descendant
of George Washington's sister.

22:10.929 --> 22:13.625
Says she had a great uncle
who was killed at the Alamo.

22:13.699 --> 22:16.793
Former Miss Cotton Bowl. Had her
own local television talk show.

22:16.868 --> 22:20.065
Look. Pakistan's Honorary
Consul to Houston, Texas.

22:20.138 --> 22:21.537
How's that for a title, huh?

22:21.606 --> 22:24.769
This is an ultra-right wing
group of anti-Communist fanatics.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.310
They're not ultra-right wing.

22:26.378 --> 22:28.141
What are they?

22:28.213 --> 22:29.976
Well, they're ultra-right wing.

22:30.048 --> 22:32.448
What are you doing
hanging around this woman?

22:32.517 --> 22:36.180
Did you hear me say she was
a former Miss Cotton Bowl?

22:36.254 --> 22:37.448
You are unbelievable.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.682
Oh, come on. You're gonna love her.

22:38.757 --> 22:40.691
And, you know, one of the things
she's trying to do over there

22:40.759 --> 22:42.283
is liberate the women.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.194
And what better way than
through a slave girl auction?

22:45.263 --> 22:46.491
JOANNE: Charlie.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.601
So sorry for keeping you waiting.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.797
Oh, it's no problem,

22:54.373 --> 22:55.362
This is Bonnie Bach.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.237
So nice to meet you.

23:00.445 --> 23:04.711
It's a pleasure meeting you, Mrs.
Herring. This is a wonderful party.

23:05.984 --> 23:08.544
Why don't you give us a few moments?

23:09.654 --> 23:10.951
Yes, sir.

23:11.590 --> 23:16.323
Oh, Bobbie, if you could ask someone
for a Bombay martini up, very dry?

23:16.395 --> 23:18.488
Oh, I'm not a slave girl, actually.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.724
I'm the Congressman's
administrative assistant.

23:20.799 --> 23:22.130
Isn't that wonderful for you.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.428
Yes.

23:23.502 --> 23:26.369
Two olives, please. Tell them
it's for me, they'll know.

23:26.438 --> 23:27.769
Certainly.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.367
She doesn't like me.

23:31.443 --> 23:32.535
Everybody likes you.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.044
She's a liberal.

23:34.112 --> 23:35.875
Well, I'm a liberal.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.111
Not where it counts.

23:38.650 --> 23:39.947
Have you seen the house?

23:40.018 --> 23:43.112
Well, I've seen the
downstairs, what's upstairs?

23:43.188 --> 23:44.519
Fourteen bedrooms.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.022
I should have a look.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.115
What did you think of the movie?

23:47.192 --> 23:48.887
What, that thing we just saw?

23:48.960 --> 23:51.019
The reason for the party, yes.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.860
Well, I'm not an expert
in the field or anything,

23:53.932 --> 23:56.765
but the production quality
seemed amateurish to me.

23:56.835 --> 23:58.325
Yeah, I'm not submitting the thing

23:58.403 --> 24:00.633
for a Golden Globe nomination, Charlie.

24:00.705 --> 24:02.969
You know what I'm talking about.

24:03.041 --> 24:05.669
Well, as a member of
the Defense Subcommittee,

24:05.744 --> 24:07.075
did you think I wasn't aware

24:07.145 --> 24:09.340
that the Soviet Union's
invaded Afghanistan?

24:09.414 --> 24:11.348
Yes, I believe my government is aware,

24:11.416 --> 24:13.907
but I was wondering if they were
thinking of doing anything about it

24:13.985 --> 24:17.182
other than boycotting the Olympics,
which I think you'll agree,

24:17.255 --> 24:18.813
was a fairly impotent response

24:18.890 --> 24:21.085
to the greatest national
security threat we've faced

24:21.159 --> 24:22.558
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.790
Well, I don't think making more
movies about it is gonna do the trick,

24:25.864 --> 24:27.456
if that's what you're asking.

24:27.532 --> 24:28.794
It's not.

24:30.001 --> 24:32.799
Exactly how much power do you have
as a member of the Subcommittee?

24:32.871 --> 24:34.361
Which one? I'm on two.

24:34.439 --> 24:35.565
Foreign Ops.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.768
Eight members and myself hand out
1 1 billion in foreign assistance.

24:38.844 --> 24:41.176
And what about the Defense Subcommittee?

24:41.246 --> 24:42.235
Our budget is hidden.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.679
It is also unlimited.

24:43.748 --> 24:45.215
Yeah.

24:46.618 --> 24:48.848
Would you like to see my room?

24:48.987 --> 24:50.079
Yeah.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.179
(WHIMPERING)

24:51.256 --> 24:55.215
So, unless I'm wrong, and
that would be unusual for me,

24:56.161 --> 24:58.186
you sit at the intersection
of the State Department,

24:58.263 --> 25:00.231
the Pentagon and the CIA.

25:00.699 --> 25:03.691
You meet in a soundproof
room underneath the Capitol,

25:03.768 --> 25:07.101
and you preside over a
secret and unlimited budget

25:07.172 --> 25:10.801
for the three agencies you would
need to conduct a covert war.

25:10.876 --> 25:12.503
Isn't that right?

25:12.577 --> 25:14.807
I also have seats at the Kennedy Center.

25:14.880 --> 25:18.247
Isn't that how you were able to
double the CIA budget for black approps

25:18.316 --> 25:20.750
in Afghanistan just by saying so?

25:20.819 --> 25:24.448
Why are you only asking mequestions
you already know the answers to?

25:24.523 --> 25:27.390
Why is Congress saying one
thing and doing nothing?

25:27.459 --> 25:29.359
Well, tradition mostly.

25:35.734 --> 25:37.065
Come here.

25:37.669 --> 25:38.761
Okay.

25:47.779 --> 25:51.977
I do not understand the
energy women have after sex.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.883
You're dancing around,
you're baking a pie.

25:54.953 --> 25:56.853
JOANNE: Charlie? Yes, ma'am?

25:56.922 --> 26:00.050
Why is the CIA running a
fake war in Afghanistan?

26:00.125 --> 26:02.116
They're doing everything they can.

26:02.193 --> 26:04.058
They're doing it badly.

26:04.262 --> 26:06.662
The CIA is arming the mujahideen.

26:06.731 --> 26:07.925
Where do you think they're
getting their weapons?

26:07.999 --> 26:11.332
They're arming them with
1 2.7 millimeter Dishukas

26:11.403 --> 26:13.030
which would be good,

26:13.104 --> 26:16.267
except the Soviets have specifically
armor-plated their Hind helicopter

26:16.341 --> 26:19.242
to resist a 1 2.7 millimeter shell.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.511
We sold Pakistan F-16s,

26:21.580 --> 26:25.277
but didn't give them the
look-downlshoot-down radar.

26:25.350 --> 26:26.408
If this were a real war,

26:26.484 --> 26:28.884
State would issue a white paper
outlining the Communist threat

26:28.954 --> 26:31.149
the way they did in El Salvador.

26:31.222 --> 26:35.056
If this were a real war, there'd
be a National Bipartisan Commission

26:35.126 --> 26:39.756
on Afghanistan, headed by Henry Kissinger
the way they did in Central America.

26:39.831 --> 26:44.029
If this were a real war, Congress
would authorize $24 million

26:44.102 --> 26:47.367
for covert operations the
way you did in Nicaragua.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.764
If this were a real war...

26:50.041 --> 26:52.874
You may be the sexiest woman ever.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.310
I'm not kidding. You are Helen of Troy.

26:55.380 --> 26:56.642
Are you patronizing me?

26:56.715 --> 26:59.115
What do you want me to do, Joanne?

26:59.284 --> 27:01.275
This is what I want you to do.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.481
I want you to save
Afghanistan for the Afghans.

27:04.889 --> 27:06.948
I want you to deliver
such a crushing defeat

27:07.025 --> 27:08.754
to the Soviets that Communism crumbles,

27:08.827 --> 27:11.193
and in so doing, end the Cold War.

27:11.262 --> 27:12.354
I'll tell you, I'd do it, too,

27:12.430 --> 27:14.921
but I got this Dairy Queen
problem in Nacogdoches.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.993
Don't underestimate me, Charlie.
Believe everything you've heard.

27:19.771 --> 27:21.500
What exactly do you want me to do?

27:21.573 --> 27:23.006
Go to Pakistan and meet with Zia.

27:23.074 --> 27:24.268
CHARLIE: Zia?

27:24.743 --> 27:26.506
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.

27:26.945 --> 27:28.606
He's the President of Pakistan.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.204
I've already arranged it.

27:30.281 --> 27:33.216
You've arranged a meeting between
me and the President of Pakistan?

27:33.284 --> 27:34.273
Yes.

27:34.352 --> 27:35.512
You're going to Israel next week

27:35.587 --> 27:37.418
to meet with Zvi Rafiah
about the Lavi jets.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.424
I want you to tack Pakistan
on the end of your trip.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.686
And meet with the President?

27:41.760 --> 27:44.923
Let him convince you that
it's a Christian imperative

27:44.996 --> 27:48.193
to let the Afghans rid
their country of Communism.

27:48.967 --> 27:52.801
Okay. It's not likely the President
of Pakistan is a Christian,

27:52.871 --> 27:55.533
but I'm gonna do this for you, Joanne,

27:55.607 --> 27:58.337
'cause you saved my ass
once with the pro-lifers

27:58.410 --> 28:02.642
and I owe you my seat in Congress
and because you look very good naked.

28:02.714 --> 28:06.741
But I have to tell you,
I'm elected by Jews.

28:06.818 --> 28:09.286
How many Jews do you
have in your district?

28:09.354 --> 28:10.378
Seven.

28:10.455 --> 28:12.514
But congressmen aren't
elected by voters,

28:12.590 --> 28:13.955
they're elected by contributors,

28:14.025 --> 28:17.017
and mine are in, well, New
York, Florida, Hollywood,

28:17.095 --> 28:19.586
because I'm one of
Israel's guys on the Hill.

28:19.664 --> 28:20.892
And I don't know how they're gonna feel

28:20.965 --> 28:23.433
about me taking up the cause of Muslims.

28:23.501 --> 28:24.832
Well, that's your problem.

28:24.903 --> 28:26.200
Yes, it is.

28:26.905 --> 28:28.429
Go fight this warand win it, Charlie.

28:28.506 --> 28:31.942
Everything possible is on the
line, including your manhood.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.808
Oh, I was afraid you
were gonna say that.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.035
(WATER RUSHING)

28:37.449 --> 28:39.974
Well, I guess it ain't
gonna be twice tonight.

28:40.051 --> 28:42.576
Well, I guess somebody can't count.

28:42.654 --> 28:45.179
Oh, darling, I was talking about me.

29:47.852 --> 29:48.978
(SPEAKING URDU)

29:51.623 --> 29:52.612
(SPEAKING URDU)

29:53.525 --> 29:54.514
(OFFICER SHOUTING)

29:54.726 --> 29:56.193
Congressman Charlie Wilson.

29:56.261 --> 29:57.250
Mr. Congressman.

29:57.328 --> 29:58.989
(CHUCKLING) Mr. President.

30:01.733 --> 30:02.859
Yeah.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.368
Joanne Herring speaks
very highly of you.

30:05.436 --> 30:07.927
Oh, well, thank you, sir. Thank you.

30:08.006 --> 30:09.803
These are two of my brightest advisors

30:09.874 --> 30:12.809
when it comes to the
problem of the Soviets.

30:13.444 --> 30:15.139
This is Brigadier Rashid.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.205
How do you do? Pleased to meet you.

30:17.282 --> 30:18.647
Colonel Mahmood. How do you do?

30:18.716 --> 30:20.206
Pleased to meet you.

30:20.285 --> 30:21.274
Please come.

30:21.352 --> 30:22.512
Thank you.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.792
You must be thirsty.
Can we get you a drink?

30:27.859 --> 30:31.659
Oh, actually I'd love a glass
of ice and any kind of whiskey.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.320
Rye, Canadian.

30:34.432 --> 30:35.421
Uh...

30:37.302 --> 30:39.429
I'm sorry, Congressman,
we don't have alcohol

30:39.504 --> 30:41.734
in the Presidential Residence.

30:42.340 --> 30:45.605
Of course, you don't. I apologize.

30:47.645 --> 30:48.805
Fruit juice?

30:48.880 --> 30:50.211
(SPEAKING URDU)

30:51.216 --> 30:52.774
Bet a lot of people make that mistake.

30:52.851 --> 30:53.840
(LAUGHING)

30:54.252 --> 30:55.276
No.

30:55.954 --> 30:56.943
Okay.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.079
Brigadier?

30:58.790 --> 31:01.918
So you understand the
situation on our border?

31:02.594 --> 31:05.859
Yes, sir, I think I do.
And I think it's terrible.

31:06.431 --> 31:09.696
And I know I speak for all the people in
the Texas Second Congressional District

31:09.767 --> 31:12.292
when I say our thoughts and
our prayers are with you.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.861
All the people of the Texas
Second Congressional District,

31:14.939 --> 31:16.304
you say? Yes, indeed, sir.

31:16.374 --> 31:20.401
Three million Afghan refugees are
living like poorly treated livestock.

31:20.478 --> 31:22.241
Another two millionhave fled into Iran.

31:22.313 --> 31:23.780
And two millionmore angry men

31:23.848 --> 31:25.873
is just what the doctors
ordered for Iran,don't you think?

31:25.950 --> 31:28.510
People are dying by
the tens of thousands.

31:28.586 --> 31:31.646
And the ones that aren't are
crossing into Pakistan every day.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.190
MAHMOOD: Would you
like to know how many?

31:33.258 --> 31:35.089
One fifth of Afghanistan now lives

31:35.159 --> 31:37.753
in Pakistan's North-West
Frontier Province.

31:37.829 --> 31:39.797
ZIA: So, what I have been wondering is

31:39.864 --> 31:43.027
why your State Department
would send someone here

31:43.101 --> 31:45.331
who thinks he understands the problem.

31:45.403 --> 31:48.895
'Cause I don't think the prayers of
the Texas Second Congressional District

31:48.973 --> 31:50.304
are going to turn the trick.

31:50.375 --> 31:53.401
Well, now, I wasn't sent here by
the State Department, Mr. President.

31:53.478 --> 31:55.469
I was asked to come here
by our friend in Houston.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.741
So this is a courtesy call.

31:57.815 --> 32:01.683
I don't need courtesy. I need
airplanes, guns and money.

32:01.753 --> 32:06.452
Well, we just doubled the
CIA budget for covert ops...

32:06.524 --> 32:07.957
From 5 million to 10 million.

32:08.026 --> 32:10.017
That's right. Is that a joke?

32:11.362 --> 32:13.455
No. Is that meant to be a funny joke?

32:13.531 --> 32:14.520
No, sir.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.396
ZIA: Congressman, what they're saying is

32:16.467 --> 32:20.130
$10 million from the U.S.
to fight the Russian Army

32:20.605 --> 32:23.836
is such a low figure that it
can be mistaken for a joke.

32:23.908 --> 32:27.639
I caught up to the sarcasm
there, sir. Let me be clear.

32:28.646 --> 32:30.807
The United States is
eager to assist you.

32:30.882 --> 32:31.940
No, you're not. You're not.

32:32.016 --> 32:33.711
Absolutely not. I went to Oxford

32:33.785 --> 32:35.082
and I know what that word means.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.383
The U.S. is not eager to assist us.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.322
Well, now it's my understanding
that we offered to  sell you F-16s.

32:40.391 --> 32:41.380
You didn't want them.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.120
Because you refused
to sell us the radar.

32:43.194 --> 32:44.456
RASHID: So to hell with that.

32:44.529 --> 32:47.862
ZIA: And this is emblematic
of American fence sitting

32:47.932 --> 32:49.422
when it comes to fighting the Soviets.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.435
To hell with it! You sell us
the planes but not the radar.

32:52.503 --> 32:55.666
You offer Afghans rifles
from the First World War

32:56.074 --> 32:59.373
while Soviet helicopters are
killing everything they can find,

32:59.444 --> 33:02.072
people, animals, food
supplies. So to hell with it!

33:02.146 --> 33:04.410
Yeah. You sell the Israelis the radar,

33:04.482 --> 33:06.473
so that's why he says,
"To hell with it."

33:06.551 --> 33:08.678
Again, I understood. Yeah.

33:08.886 --> 33:12.322
Also, the arms and funding
should flow through us.

33:14.392 --> 33:15.416
I'm sorry?

33:15.493 --> 33:17.222
That's been part of the problem.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.820
The arms and the funding
should flow through us.

33:19.897 --> 33:22.525
We have experience with
warfare of this kind.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.535
And your CIA has an
unimpressive track record.

33:25.603 --> 33:27.764
Oh. I wouldn't say that.

33:27.839 --> 33:31.741
They missed 130,000 Soviet
soldiers walking into Afghanistan.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.404
Okay, we blew that call.

33:34.479 --> 33:36.003
I would say so.

33:39.817 --> 33:46.052
Well, I don't want to use up
any more of your hospitality,

33:46.124 --> 33:50.993
so I will take your message
back to my committee chairman,

33:51.062 --> 33:53.860
and we will give it
our fullest attention.

33:54.065 --> 33:56.192
Let me walk you to the door.

33:57.802 --> 33:58.791
(OFFICER SHOUTS COMMAND)

34:01.072 --> 34:03.666
I learned about you
before you came here.

34:03.741 --> 34:07.040
I learned that you're a
man of many character flaws.

34:07.245 --> 34:08.337
I am.

34:08.446 --> 34:10.539
But I also learned that
you never promise anything

34:10.614 --> 34:12.344
you cannot deliver.

34:12.550 --> 34:14.210
No, I don't, Mr. President.

34:14.284 --> 34:15.775
Then promise me this.

34:15.853 --> 34:18.947
Go to Peshawar and
see the refugee camps.

34:19.290 --> 34:20.917
Right now. Today.

34:21.426 --> 34:24.224
Go to Peshawar and
see with your own eyes.

34:24.395 --> 34:27.125
I have a helicopter waiting to take you.

34:28.032 --> 34:29.897
All right, I'll do it.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.692
Thank you, Mr. Congressman.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.065
Mr. President.

34:38.676 --> 34:40.643
All right, you, come on.

34:43.047 --> 34:44.172
How did it go?

34:44.248 --> 34:45.510
Well, there were three of them.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.710
It was like getting slapped around
by a Pakistani vaudeville team.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.117
You know you've pretty
much hit rock bottom

34:50.188 --> 34:51.882
when you've been told you
have character flaws by a man

34:51.956 --> 34:54.947
who hanged his predecessor
in a military coup.

34:55.025 --> 34:56.014
Can we go home now?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.756
No. No, we have to make one more stop.

35:58.289 --> 35:59.722
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

36:46.470 --> 36:48.267
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)

36:54.679 --> 36:56.306
I've seen enough.

36:59.016 --> 37:03.476
About 350 people in three
small villages at Kandahar.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.546
But instead of doing it all at once,

37:06.624 --> 37:09.058
the Russians would
make the parents watch

37:09.126 --> 37:11.617
as they slit the
throats of the children.

37:11.696 --> 37:13.823
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

37:15.199 --> 37:21.866
So, the Russians gathered all the
defectors and piled them like wood

37:21.939 --> 37:24.134
in the center of the village.

37:24.709 --> 37:27.041
Then they ran over
them with their tanks.

When I reached down to grab
it, it exploded in my hand.

37:40.224 --> 37:41.623
I should have known.

37:41.692 --> 37:46.720
Because last year my little brother
tried to pick up a piece of candy.

37:48.399 --> 37:50.196
It split him in half.

37:50.901 --> 37:54.564
It takes more work to take care
of a wounded child than a dead one.

37:54.639 --> 37:57.472
So when the Russians cover
fields with toy mines,

37:57.541 --> 38:01.773
adults who might help with the war
effort have to take care of the children.

39:16.721 --> 39:18.313

39:19.657 --> 39:21.557
Look, normally, a
congressional delegation,

39:21.625 --> 39:25.026
we'd give them a courtesy briefing
on the situation, but as you can see,

39:25.096 --> 39:28.463
it's getting pretty late, we don't
have a whole lot of time anyway, so...

39:28.532 --> 39:30.295
Well, make the time. Huh?

39:31.168 --> 39:33.864
Fuck your time, Harold. I'm
on Defense Appropriations.

39:48.986 --> 39:50.146
and in the airports.

I'm sorry?

39:58.028 --> 39:59.689

39:59.764 --> 40:01.356
Soviet advisors have appropriated

40:01.432 --> 40:03.593
the Afghan intel service
and the ministries.

40:03.667 --> 40:05.100
Which ministries?

40:05.169 --> 40:06.568
All of them.

40:06.904 --> 40:11.170
Anyway, the fourth armored
covers Bagram Airbase.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.470
Seventh Armored is...

40:12.543 --> 40:15.341
Why ain't they shooting
down them helicopters?

40:15.413 --> 40:16.641
I'm sorry?

40:16.714 --> 40:18.341
The helicopters, Harold.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.852
Why ain't we giving them something
to shoot down them helicopters?

40:21.919 --> 40:25.411
The helicopters are a problem.

40:27.324 --> 40:28.655
You think?

40:29.460 --> 40:31.792
Congressman... They're
shooting at Soviet gunships

40:31.862 --> 40:35.559
with Enfield rifles. That's
basically what Davy Crockett used.

40:35.633 --> 40:38.466
The Soviet Hind gunship is especially
armor plated to resist bullets.

40:38.536 --> 40:42.495
Yeah, I know, I know. So you tell
me what you need to shoot them down.

40:42.573 --> 40:43.562
What do you mean?

40:43.641 --> 40:45.370
Tell me what you need.

40:46.610 --> 40:47.702
Do you understand what I'm saying?

40:47.778 --> 40:51.646
You tell me what you need, and I
will go about getting it for you.

40:51.715 --> 40:54.047
Congressman, I appreciate
your generosity,

40:54.118 --> 40:58.987
but a sudden influx of money and
modern weaponry would draw attention.

40:59.890 --> 41:02.415
What? A sudden influx
of money and modern...

41:02.493 --> 41:04.518
Wait, it would draw attention?

41:04.595 --> 41:05.619
Yeah.

41:06.564 --> 41:09.158
Why, I don't even know what that means.

41:09.233 --> 41:10.996
This is the Cold War.
Everybody knows about it.

41:11.068 --> 41:12.126
Should I continue with the briefing?

41:12.203 --> 41:16.299
Have you been to these refugee
camps? Have you heard these stories?

41:16.373 --> 41:19.570

to give you a briefing.

41:19.944 --> 41:21.605

41:21.912 --> 41:23.402
No. Thank you.

41:35.025 --> 41:36.822
(SIGHING)

41:37.094 --> 41:42.122
You know, I had a neighbor, growing
up, with a name right out of Dickens.

41:43.267 --> 41:45.428
Mr. Charles Hazard.

41:46.804 --> 41:49.967
And Mr. Hazard didn't
like the neighborhood dogs

41:50.040 --> 41:52.133
messing up his flower beds.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.541
One day, I heard a bunch of
yelling from across the street,

41:54.612 --> 41:56.045
so I ran on over to Mr. Hazard's,

41:56.113 --> 41:59.879
and there were about 15 grown-ups
standing around my dog, Teddy,

41:59.950 --> 42:03.852
who was writhing on the
ground in obvious agony.

42:04.388 --> 42:06.253
Blood was pouring out of his mouth.

42:06.323 --> 42:08.655
Mr. Hazard had ground up a glass bottle

42:08.726 --> 42:11.991
and put it in a bowl of
dog food and fed it to him.

42:13.697 --> 42:15.289
What did you do?

42:15.833 --> 42:18.927
Well, I got some gasoline and
burned down his flower beds.

42:19.003 --> 42:21.437
But that wasn't satisfying enough.

42:22.573 --> 42:26.202
And then I remembered, Mr.
Hazard was an elected official.

42:26.277 --> 42:28.609
He was the head of the town council.

42:28.679 --> 42:31.580
His reelection every two years
was a foregone conclusion.

42:31.649 --> 42:36.086
So come Election Day, I drove
over to the black section of town.

42:36.153 --> 42:39.452
Now, these people hadn't voted
in any of these elections, so...

42:39.523 --> 42:42.424
I was only 13, but I
had a farmer's license

42:43.961 --> 42:45.451
and I filled up my car with black voters

42:45.529 --> 42:46.791
and drove them to the polling place

42:46.864 --> 42:48.195
and then waited, then
drove them on home.

42:48.265 --> 42:51.200
But before they got
out of the car to vote

42:51.268 --> 42:56.399
I said, "I don't mean to influence
you, but I think you should know

42:56.473 --> 43:00.068
"Mr. Charles Hazard has
intentionally killed my dog."

43:02.479 --> 43:05.175
About 400 ballots were
cast in that election.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.843
I drove 96 of them to the polls.

43:08.953 --> 43:11.046
Hazard lost by 16 votes.

43:14.625 --> 43:18.117
And that's the day I
fell in love with America.

43:21.665 --> 43:23.462
What time do we land?

43:24.101 --> 43:26.126
7:30 a.m. in D.C.

43:26.837 --> 43:29.431
I want the CIA in my office at 10:00.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.765
Assistant Deputy Director or higher.

43:33.177 --> 43:35.839
Tell them that if I don't
see someone at 10:00,

43:35.913 --> 43:40.850
I'm gonna start docking their allowance
at a rate of $1 million a minute.

43:41.051 --> 43:42.313
Yes, sir.

43:42.653 --> 43:44.086

and 82 millimeter mortars are
coming into Pakistan by air and sea,

43:55.532 --> 43:57.193
and then trucks take
them to the Afghan border.

43:57.267 --> 43:59.167
AGENT WELLS: Then we
take them across on mules,

43:59.236 --> 44:00.863
which are running a little
more than we thought.

44:00.938 --> 44:02.633
The mules? They're 2,400 a piece,

44:02.706 --> 44:04.674
plus we got to get them
checked out. For what?

44:04.742 --> 44:08.007
Diseases. Foot and mouth. Plus they
have to have their ears cleaned.

44:08.078 --> 44:10.444
The mules are getting better
health care than the Afghans.

44:10.514 --> 44:13.813
AGENT WELLS: Plus, they're gonna cost a
little extra if we want them pre-trained.

44:13.884 --> 44:15.408
To do what? Walk over a mountain

44:15.486 --> 44:16.612
with ammunition on their back.

44:16.687 --> 44:18.018
Aren't they born with that instinct?

44:18.088 --> 44:20.784
I mean, isn't that something
they want to do naturally?

44:20.858 --> 44:24.089
You think Afghanistan might, one day,
think about building some fucking roads?

44:24.161 --> 44:25.924
Gust. Yeah?

44:25.996 --> 44:27.964
I got something for you.

44:28.932 --> 44:30.331
I need you to be specific...

44:30.401 --> 44:32.869
MARLA: The whole thing has changed.
Get your diary. I'll show you.

44:32.936 --> 44:34.028
Okay.

44:35.272 --> 44:37.206
RECEPTIONIST: No problem. Thank you.

44:38.742 --> 44:39.902
He should be here any moment.

44:39.977 --> 44:42.639
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

44:44.148 --> 44:45.877
Good morning. Good morning, Congressman.

44:45.949 --> 44:47.576
Welcome back. Yeah. Marla.

44:47.651 --> 44:49.084
Welcome back. Suzanne.

44:49.153 --> 44:50.620
Welcome back.

44:51.955 --> 44:52.979
Who are you?

44:53.057 --> 44:54.251
RECEPTIONIST: This is Gust Avrakotos.

44:54.324 --> 44:56.087
He's come up from Langley
to bring you the information

44:56.160 --> 44:58.151
that you wanted.Bonnie!

44:58.662 --> 44:59.651
Yes, sir?

44:59.730 --> 45:01.322
I said Assistant Deputy
Director or higher.

45:01.398 --> 45:03.298
I know, sir. I called... No,
Assistant Deputies don't come

45:03.367 --> 45:04.459
to the Hill without a subpoena.

45:04.535 --> 45:07.231
I'm the guy you want to talk to,
Congressman. I'm on the Afghan desk.

45:07.304 --> 45:09.204
You're on the Afghan desk? Yeah.

45:09.273 --> 45:11.867
Well, I wouldn't be too proud of
that. I just got back from there.

45:11.942 --> 45:14.274
Oh, I know. And that's
a hell of a flight, too.

45:14.344 --> 45:16.175
That nine hours flying
time against the jet stream.

45:16.246 --> 45:18.373
Probably had to stop in Brussels,
plus the time difference.

45:18.449 --> 45:19.780
I'd be a little grumpy myself.

45:19.850 --> 45:21.442
I ain't grumpy because of the plane.

45:22.586 --> 45:25.714
We want to give you this 'cause
we know you like single malt.

45:25.789 --> 45:27.256
It's called Talisker,

45:27.324 --> 45:29.315
and it's mentioned in a
Robert Louis Stevenson poem,

45:29.393 --> 45:31.224
The Scotsman's Return from Abroad.

45:31.295 --> 45:33.160
"The king o' drinks, as I conceive it,

45:33.230 --> 45:35.721
"Talisker, Isla or Glenlivet!"

45:35.799 --> 45:38.290
Who are you again? Gust Avrakotos.

45:39.670 --> 45:41.103
Have Bonnie come into this meeting.

45:41.171 --> 45:42.729
MARLA: Yes, sir.

45:43.540 --> 45:45.167
What's the gift for?

45:45.242 --> 45:48.109
It's from the Afghan desk for
doubling the budget for the mujahideen.

45:48.178 --> 45:50.908
Oh. Well, thank you.

45:51.548 --> 45:53.072
It was nothing.

45:53.350 --> 45:55.841
Well, it's a nice bottle of Scotch.

45:56.653 --> 45:57.677
Must've been hard to get.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.518
No, doubling the budget was nothing.

45:59.590 --> 46:02.616
I mean, $10 million for covert ops
against the Russian Army is meaningless.

46:02.693 --> 46:05.184
What are you, an infant? Now,
you hang on just one second.

46:05.262 --> 46:06.251
I don't remember your name.

46:06.330 --> 46:07.661
Gust Avrakotos.

46:07.731 --> 46:08.720
Gust Avrakotos.

46:08.799 --> 46:09.788
Yeah.

46:09.867 --> 46:11.562
Okay, you mind if I call you Gus?

46:11.635 --> 46:14.069
Yeah, well, my name's Gust
with a "t," but I don't care.

46:14.138 --> 46:19.576
Fifteen hours ago, I offered Harold
Holt the keys to the safe, okay?

46:20.410 --> 46:24.642
I stood there in the office in Islamabad,
and I said, "How much do you need?"

46:24.715 --> 46:26.239
And I was apparently annoying him.

46:26.316 --> 46:29.080
Well, Harold Holt's a massive tool,
Congressman. He's a cake-eater.

46:29.153 --> 46:30.848
He's a clown.He's a bad station chief.

46:30.921 --> 46:33.981
And I don't mean to cast aspersions on
a guy, but he's gonna get us all killed.

46:34.057 --> 46:35.217
Really? Yeah.

46:35.292 --> 46:38.193
Well, how does he expect to defeat
the Soviets in Afghanistan without...

46:38.262 --> 46:40.321
He said, "A sudden influx of
money..." Yeah, an influx of money

46:40.397 --> 46:41.762
and new weaponry would draw attention.

46:41.832 --> 46:44.300
He's not trying to defeat
the Soviets, Congressman.

46:44.368 --> 46:45.460
What the hell are you talking about?

46:45.536 --> 46:46.525
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

46:47.504 --> 46:48.835
Excuse me.

46:49.973 --> 46:51.668
I'm the Congressman's aide, Bonnie Bach.

46:51.742 --> 46:52.936
Gust Avrakotos.

46:53.010 --> 46:54.671
Gus, I need the room for a second.

46:54.745 --> 46:56.440
Sure. Jailbait!

47:00.184 --> 47:02.778
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. Whoa, all right.

47:02.853 --> 47:04.047
Just tell me what's happening.

47:04.121 --> 47:06.351
A Justice Department task
force that was formed last year

47:06.423 --> 47:08.618
to investigate reports of sex
between members of the House

47:08.692 --> 47:10.626
and their male internshas
recently widened

47:10.694 --> 47:12.491
to include the use of recreational drugs

47:12.563 --> 47:14.497
by senators and congressmen.

47:14.565 --> 47:15.827
Do you know a man named Paul Brown?

47:15.899 --> 47:17.093
BONNIE: He doesn't have
to answer that. Keep going.

47:17.167 --> 47:18.156
Oh, shit.

47:18.235 --> 47:21.966
Paul Brown, under investigation
by federal prosecutors for fraud.

47:22.706 --> 47:25.641
He wanted me to invest in
some TV show for Crystal.

47:25.709 --> 47:28.075
Well, he's saying he witnessed
youdoing cocaine nine times

47:28.145 --> 47:30.113
in a fantasy suite in Las Vegas.

47:30.180 --> 47:32.876
Brian Ross at NBC is breaking the story.

47:33.016 --> 47:36.975
All right, guys. I was in Las
Vegas with Crystal and Paul Brown,

47:37.054 --> 47:39.352
because she wanted me to
talk to him about this thing.

47:39.423 --> 47:41.084
There was cocaine?

47:42.192 --> 47:44.251
I want you to go in the other
room and start on a statement.

47:44.328 --> 47:45.852
Let's get Stu on the
phone. Okay, I'll call him.

47:45.929 --> 47:46.987
BONNIE: Okay, Bait, you
just need to start...

47:47.064 --> 47:48.053
CHARLIE: It's all right, everybody.

47:48.131 --> 47:49.655
It's gonna be all right.
I want to get back to...

47:49.733 --> 47:50.791
Gus!

47:52.636 --> 47:53.694
You having problems?

47:53.770 --> 47:54.862
(CLEARS THROAT)

47:54.938 --> 47:55.996
No.

47:56.073 --> 47:58.667
What do you mean,he's not
trying todefeat the Soviets?

47:58.742 --> 48:01.370
Well, he wants to bleed
them.Payback for Vietnam.

48:01.445 --> 48:02.969
Make it so they just haveto
keep sending troops in,

48:03.046 --> 48:04.343
keep sending money,and troops, and money

48:04.414 --> 48:06.314
until they just go outof their
fucking minds the way we did.

48:06.383 --> 48:09.045
You mean to tell me that the
U.S. strategyin Afghanistan

48:09.119 --> 48:11.110
is to have the Afghans keep
walking into machine gun fire

48:11.188 --> 48:12.348
till the Russians run out of bullets?

48:12.422 --> 48:13.514
That's Harold Holt's strategy.

48:13.590 --> 48:15.490
It's not U.S. strategy.
What is U.S. strategy?

48:15.559 --> 48:16.992
Well, strictly speaking,
we don't have one.

48:17.060 --> 48:18.152
But we're working hard on that.

48:18.228 --> 48:19.695
Who's we? Me and three other guys.

48:19.763 --> 48:20.752
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

48:21.431 --> 48:23.194
Would you excuse me?

48:23.267 --> 48:24.256
(CLEARS THROAT)

48:27.971 --> 48:28.995
All right, what do you have?

48:29.072 --> 48:32.303
"Representative Charles Wilson has learned
he is joining several members of Congress

48:32.376 --> 48:35.243
"who are under investigation by a
Justice Department task force that is..."

48:35.312 --> 48:36.574
Don't say task force. It makes it sound

48:36.647 --> 48:37.909
like Eliot Ness is
running the thing. Okay.

48:37.981 --> 48:40.575
Who is running the thing?
Who's the prosecutor?

48:40.651 --> 48:42.380
Rudolph Giuliani, New
York, Southern District.

48:42.452 --> 48:44.010
You know him? No.

48:44.087 --> 48:46.214
Well, it's been going on
forever. We should say that, too.

48:46.290 --> 48:49.384
"Representative Charles Wilson has learned
he is joining several members of Congress

"He denies any allegation of

"and will fully cooperate with
the ongoing investigation."

49:09.579 --> 49:10.637
Gus!

49:13.550 --> 49:16.075
You and three other guys? Yeah.

49:16.153 --> 49:19.953
Well, I'll tell you what I told
Harold Holt. I can get the money.

49:20.023 --> 49:23.015
Now, the 10 million is a
joke? Fine. What do you need?

49:23.093 --> 49:24.822
To do what? To shoot
down the helicopters.

49:24.895 --> 49:26.021
To shoot down the helicopters.

49:26.096 --> 49:28.656
If we can help them shoot
down the goddamn helicopters,

49:28.732 --> 49:30.097
everything's gonna start going our way.

49:30.167 --> 49:33.603
You know, there's a story about
a Zen master and a little boy.

49:33.670 --> 49:35.570
(KNOCK ON DOOR) All right, and... Yeah.

49:38.809 --> 49:39.833
It's Stu.

49:39.910 --> 49:41.400
You should be on this.

49:43.380 --> 49:44.438
Stu?

49:44.948 --> 49:46.848
No. No, it's gonna be fine.

49:46.917 --> 49:48.885
It was a party in Vegas.

49:49.252 --> 49:51.152
Lot of drugs, lot of
people I don't know.

49:51.221 --> 49:54.520
I was there with Crystal
Lee and this guy Paul Brown

49:54.591 --> 49:57.754
who wanted me to invest
in a TV show for Crystal.

49:58.228 --> 49:59.252
I don't know.

49:59.329 --> 50:02.355
I don't know, it's gonna be
like a Dallas set in Washington.

50:02.432 --> 50:04.593
What... Stu, what does it matter?

50:04.668 --> 50:05.760
Okay.

50:06.403 --> 50:07.495
Okay.

50:08.071 --> 50:10.301
Will Crystal back up your
story that you weren't using?

50:10.374 --> 50:12.672
Just go put out the statement.

50:12.843 --> 50:14.333
You know what?

50:14.644 --> 50:18.205
You never should have been
in the same room, Congressman.

50:18.281 --> 50:19.270
(DOOR SLAMS)

50:20.684 --> 50:21.742
Gus!

50:23.053 --> 50:26.511
Yeah. The Swiss make an antiaircraft gun

50:26.590 --> 50:28.387
called the Oerlikon. Listen, Charlie.

50:28.458 --> 50:30.085
Twenty-millimeter
cannon, high rate of fire.

50:30.160 --> 50:31.752
I know the Oerlikon.

50:31.828 --> 50:33.728
Don't forget the limo driver.

50:33.797 --> 50:34.855
What do you mean?

50:34.931 --> 50:37.729
Well, you took a limo from
the casino to the airport.

50:37.801 --> 50:40.497
Maybe it's easy enough to track down
a limo driver, hand him a subpoena,

50:40.570 --> 50:42.197
ask him if anything was
going on in the back seat,

50:42.272 --> 50:44.263
so, you know, in terms
of cleaning up this...

50:44.341 --> 50:45.831
Were you listening at the door?

50:45.909 --> 50:47.740
I wasn't listening at the
door. Were you standing

50:47.811 --> 50:49.938
at the goddamn door listening to me? No.

50:50.013 --> 50:52.447
How could you even...
That's a thick door!

50:52.516 --> 50:54.313
You stood there and you listened to me?

50:54.384 --> 50:55.715
I wasn't standing at the
door. Don't be an idiot.

50:55.786 --> 50:57.083
I bugged the Scotch bottle.

50:57.154 --> 50:58.212
What?

50:59.222 --> 51:00.348
Yeah, it's got a little
transmitter on it.

51:00.424 --> 51:03.291
I got a little thing
in my ear. Get past it.

51:03.360 --> 51:06.693
I don't believe this. Who the
fuck... Who the fuck are you?

51:06.763 --> 51:08.492
It's not in my ear
right now. Take it easy.

51:08.565 --> 51:10.965
I was gonna tell you about it, but
I had to leave the room for a second

51:11.034 --> 51:13.059
'cause you were getting indicted.
I ain't getting indicted.

51:13.136 --> 51:15.536
Is there a camera in here?
No, that's a little paranoid.

51:15.605 --> 51:16.765
That's right.

51:16.840 --> 51:19.900
Will you take the bug
off my Scotch bottle now?

51:20.277 --> 51:21.369
Sure.

51:24.081 --> 51:27.244
I saw two kids, had
their hands blown off

51:27.651 --> 51:29.380
when they tried to
pick up something shiny.

51:29.453 --> 51:32.445
Sometimes the kids think
those bombs are toys.

51:32.556 --> 51:34.854
For children to pick up. Yeah.

51:35.425 --> 51:36.949
They're raping the women and... Yeah.

...bayoneting the pregnant
ones. It's as bad as it can be.

51:40.297 --> 51:43.391
But they still want to go
out and fight the Red Army.

51:43.467 --> 51:45.526

never seen anything like that.

51:45.602 --> 51:47.194
No, me, neither.

51:47.804 --> 51:50.466
Let's be clear. I want to kill
Russians as much as you do.

51:50.540 --> 51:53.600
Is the Oerlikon the right gun?
Is that what they should have?

51:53.677 --> 51:55.406
Now, you know what?

51:55.645 --> 51:56.669
You've had a long flight.

51:56.746 --> 51:58.441
You're under a lot of
stress. You're under arrest.

51:58.515 --> 52:00.039
I ain't under arrest.

52:00.117 --> 52:01.709
Do you drink? Oh, God, yeah.

52:01.785 --> 52:03.309
Well, should we try this Scotch,

52:03.386 --> 52:05.115
or is it gonna release
sarin gas when I open it?

52:05.188 --> 52:08.123
Oh, I don't think so,
but open it over there.

get into the Agency?

guy? You ain't James Bond.

so let's call it even.

52:23.173 --> 52:24.265
Deal.

52:25.976 --> 52:27.500
Since there's no other
reason I should be here,

52:27.577 --> 52:30.637
let's assume it's 'cause
I'm very good at this.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.618
They need to shoot down
the helicopters, Gus.

52:35.685 --> 52:38.245
They need at least, what, 50 Oerlikons.

52:38.321 --> 52:40.289
Yeah, it's gonna cost a
lot more than $10 million.

52:40.357 --> 52:42.257
And I say for the fourth
time, I can raise the money.

52:42.325 --> 52:43.622
Yeah, how?

52:43.693 --> 52:46.856
Is the Oerlikon the gun
I should be recommending?

52:46.997 --> 52:48.430
I'm not sure.

52:48.498 --> 52:51.023
Who is sure? A weapons
guy named Mike Vickers.

52:51.101 --> 52:53.331
I'll call him. Yeah.
Let's call him right now.

52:59.342 --> 53:01.333
All right, here's a test.

53:01.912 --> 53:03.573
You see the nerdy-looking
kid in the white shirt

53:03.647 --> 53:05.706
playing against the four guys at once?

53:05.782 --> 53:06.771
CHARLIE: Yeah.

53:06.950 --> 53:09.475
Which one of the guys do you
think is a strategic weapons expert

53:09.553 --> 53:11.680
with the CIA?

53:12.222 --> 53:13.689
(SIGHING)

53:14.090 --> 53:15.284
That was a trick question, Charlie.

53:15.358 --> 53:17.826
It's the nerdy-looking
kid in the white shirt.

53:17.894 --> 53:19.521
All right, no reason this
can't be fun, you know.

53:19.596 --> 53:22.190
Mike! Yeah, just a second.

53:22.666 --> 53:24.395
Need you now, Mike.

53:28.505 --> 53:29.972
Keep playing.

53:31.308 --> 53:33.469
Mike Vickers, this is
Congressman Charles Wilson

53:33.543 --> 53:35.534
of the Defense
Appropriations Subcommittee.

53:35.612 --> 53:38.103
How are you, sir? Fine, thank you.

53:39.049 --> 53:41.950
How old are you? I'll be 30 next week.

53:42.018 --> 53:44.418
This is the CIA's weapons expert?

53:44.521 --> 53:46.182
One of them. But he's the most senior.

53:46.256 --> 53:47.280
GUS: Look... MAN: Mike!

53:47.357 --> 53:49.655
Yeah, bishop to queen's knight 7.

53:49.726 --> 53:51.353
See? He's playing without
even looking at the board.

53:51.428 --> 53:52.554
That's a useful skill

53:52.629 --> 53:55.655
if Afghanistan's ever
invaded by Boris Spassky.

53:55.732 --> 53:58.030
Did my office not make it clear
to Langley that I'm in no mood

53:58.101 --> 53:59.125
to be fucked around with? Charlie...

53:59.202 --> 54:01.363
You answer to me or you answer
to Jim Baker. Which do you want?

54:01.438 --> 54:04.305
All right, the guy's a fucking Green
Beret, Charlie. He trained with the SEALs.

54:04.374 --> 54:06.899
No one's trying to fuck
with you! MAN: Mike?

54:06.977 --> 54:09.912
Yeah, what was your move?
Knight to queen's bishop 5.

54:09.980 --> 54:11.572
All right, queen to king's rook 3.

54:11.648 --> 54:14.674
Guy on the right, you don't
want to trade queens with me.

54:14.751 --> 54:15.843
Shit.

54:16.186 --> 54:18.677
All right, I apologize.

54:18.755 --> 54:20.746
Okay. Everybody friends?

54:20.857 --> 54:24.190
As a former naval officer myself,
Mike, I should've known better.

54:24.261 --> 54:26.286
As a former naval officer, I'd
have been surprised if you had.

54:26.363 --> 54:27.387
Now, what the fuck? Hey.

54:27.464 --> 54:29.329
He said he was sorry. Hey.

54:29.399 --> 54:30.889
What can I do for you, sir?

54:30.967 --> 54:33.800
All right, he wants to make a
recommendation to his Subcommittee.

54:33.870 --> 54:36.862
Now, the Swiss made Oerlikon S.T.A.
antiaircraft cannon, that's what you'd use

54:36.940 --> 54:39.431
to shoot down the Ml-24 Hind
gunship in the mountains, right?

54:39.509 --> 54:40.635
Well, the Oerlikon's a good start,

54:40.710 --> 54:42.974
but the Russians will just start
flying higher altitude missions.

54:43.046 --> 54:44.070
So what else do they need?

54:44.147 --> 54:46.911
Same thing you give us.
AK-47 s, AK-7 4s, AKMS.

54:46.983 --> 54:49.042
The Soviets didn't come into
Afghanistan on a Eurail Pass.

54:49.119 --> 54:50.609
They came in T-55 tanks.

54:50.687 --> 54:53.417
The fighters need RPG-7
anti-tank grenade launchers,

54:53.490 --> 54:57.893
Katyusha 107 mm rockets, wire mines,
plastic mines, bicycle bombs, sniper rifles,

54:57.961 --> 54:59.394
ammunition for all the above

54:59.462 --> 55:01.225
and frequency-hopping
radios and burst transmitters

55:01.298 --> 55:03.926
so these guys aren't
so fucking easy to find.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.968
Well, I've written it all
in a report you can read.

55:06.036 --> 55:08.334
You'd be the first one who did.

55:09.506 --> 55:11.804
Send a copy of it to me by
secure courier right away.

55:11.875 --> 55:14.105
I will. All right. All right.

55:16.513 --> 55:17.912
There was a report?

55:17.981 --> 55:19.243
It's not that simple.

55:19.916 --> 55:22.714
Why not? Well, for
one thing it's covert.

55:22.786 --> 55:24.413
When an Afghan freedom
fighter gets captured,

55:24.487 --> 55:25.920
it can't be with an
American-made weapon on him.

55:25.989 --> 55:27.889
That's how a cold war
turns into an actual war,

55:27.957 --> 55:29.891
and that's something you
want to keep a good eye on.

55:29.959 --> 55:31.950
So anything we give
them has to look like

55:32.028 --> 55:34.929
it could have plausibly been
captured from the Soviets.

55:34.998 --> 55:36.693
Yeah, that's right. You
know who's good at that?

55:36.766 --> 55:39.098
Israel and Egypt. That's right.

55:40.704 --> 55:42.137
You know what Vickers
just described back there

55:42.205 --> 55:44.639
could cost as much as $40 million.

55:44.908 --> 55:47.536
I can get the appropriation. But how?

55:48.511 --> 55:50.570
I want to know how are you gonna
get the approval of Congress

55:50.647 --> 55:52.342
when they're saying no to
the Contras for nothing,

55:52.415 --> 55:55.077
for $5 million, a request
made by the President?

55:55.151 --> 55:57.210
When a black approp makes
it through this Subcommittee,

55:57.287 --> 55:59.517
the full body has to vote on it blind.

55:59.589 --> 56:01.750
They know the dollar amount, but
they don't know what it's for.

56:01.825 --> 56:05.852
So, theoretically, your $10
million can become 40 million

56:05.929 --> 56:07.954
without anyone ever noticing
but the Russian Army.

56:08.031 --> 56:09.896
Because Congress wouldn't
know what it was voting on.

56:09.966 --> 56:11.024
That's the beauty of it!

56:11.101 --> 56:12.864
All you need are the nine
other Subcommittee members.

56:12.936 --> 56:14.460
All I really need is
the Committee Chairman.

56:14.537 --> 56:16.300
Doc Long. Doc Long.

56:16.639 --> 56:19.733
And with Doc's backing, you'll get the
votes of the other Committee members.

56:19.809 --> 56:20.935
Yep. I don't believe you.

56:21.010 --> 56:22.034
I don't care.

56:22.112 --> 56:23.374
And until the phone rang
this morning, Charlie,

56:23.446 --> 56:25.710
I didn't know I'd never heard of you.

56:25.782 --> 56:27.409
Well, ask around.

56:27.550 --> 56:29.677
I did. And what'd you find out?

56:29.753 --> 56:31.744
That your greatest legislative
achievement in six terms

56:31.821 --> 56:33.288
was getting reelected five times.

56:33.356 --> 56:34.380
Anything else?

56:34.457 --> 56:36.789
That you hold more IOUs
than any member of the House.

56:36.860 --> 56:37.884
(LAUGHING)

56:37.961 --> 56:39.485
How about that?

56:39.662 --> 56:43.291
I represent the only district in
America that doesn't want anything.

56:43.366 --> 56:46.301
They want their guns, they
want low taxes, that's it.

56:46.369 --> 56:49.167
I can do favors. I
get to vote yes a lot.

56:51.374 --> 56:54.571
Now, me and three other
guys are killing Russians.

56:54.644 --> 56:55.906
I mean, is it possible

56:55.979 --> 56:59.779
that I've met the only elected
official in town who can help?

57:01.651 --> 57:03.983
Give me a week to set things up.

57:04.087 --> 57:07.784
Go pack a bag. I have a friend,
an arms dealer in Israel.

57:08.258 --> 57:10.226
He's who we need for this, God help us.

57:10.293 --> 57:12.488
Should be interesting. Yeah.

57:13.396 --> 57:14.420
All right.

57:15.732 --> 57:17.222
CHARLIE: We need you, Zvi.

57:17.300 --> 57:19.768
You're gonna be our man
inside the Israeli Parliament.

57:19.836 --> 57:21.599
ZVl: I'm not in the Israeli Parliament.

57:21.671 --> 57:23.662
That's what's gonna
make you so effective.

57:23.740 --> 57:26.038
No one has your pull
with the 10th Knesset.

57:26.109 --> 57:28.202
No one has your relationship
with the Speaker.

57:28.278 --> 57:30.508
And we are gonna... We're gonna
need your arm around Menachem,

57:30.580 --> 57:34.482
when he finds out that we're
working with Egypt and the Saudis.

57:34.884 --> 57:37.785
Tell him. Tell him why we need him.

57:38.288 --> 57:40.848
GUS: I'm not saying anything. Why not?

57:41.191 --> 57:43.819
I don't know who the fuck
these two other guys are.

57:43.893 --> 57:45.986
Well, ain't they bodyguards? Not ours.

57:46.095 --> 57:47.153
Zvi?

57:51.334 --> 57:53.996
Now, just to sum this up in a nutshell.

57:54.571 --> 57:57.165
You want me to move Israel

57:57.774 --> 58:02.404
toward a partnership with
Egypt, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

58:02.479 --> 58:04.106
And Saudi Arabia.

58:05.782 --> 58:08.808
Well, just a couple of problems I
can foresee off the top of my head.

58:08.885 --> 58:09.909
Look.

58:09.986 --> 58:11.010
Charlie... I know.

58:11.087 --> 58:15.251
...Pakistan and Afghanistan don't
recognize our right to exist.

58:15.325 --> 58:19.193
Calm down. We just got done
fighting a war with Egypt

58:19.262 --> 58:22.595
and every person who has ever
tried to kill me and my family,

58:22.665 --> 58:24.690
has been trained in Saudi Arabia.

58:24.767 --> 58:26.997
That's not entirely true, Zvi.

58:27.303 --> 58:29.498
I mean, some of them were trained by us.

58:29.572 --> 58:31.039
CHARLIE: Gus, come on.

58:32.108 --> 58:35.134
It's his sense of humor. It's
a bit of an acquired taste.

58:35.211 --> 58:37.236
Now, Zvi, look at me.

58:37.780 --> 58:40.647
This is the front of the Cold War.

58:40.717 --> 58:43.686
It's not in Berlin, it's not in
Cuba, it's not in Czechoslovakia.

58:43.753 --> 58:46.313
It's in a pile of rocks
called Afghanistan.

58:46.389 --> 58:48.983
These are the only people who are
actually shooting at the Russians.

58:49.058 --> 58:51.822
Now, you and I know we have
to get Soviet-made weapons

58:51.895 --> 58:53.260
into the hands of the mujahideen.

58:53.329 --> 58:55.058
And you and I know where
the largest stockpile

58:55.131 --> 58:58.032
of Soviet weapons outside
the Soviet Union is.

58:58.101 --> 58:59.693
I can't tell you offhand how many

58:59.769 --> 59:01.999
and what kind of weapons
we've confiscated.

59:02.071 --> 59:06.405
I can. These are Keyhole-1
1 satellite photos.

59:07.176 --> 59:10.270
They've been degraded so
I can show them to you.

59:10.446 --> 59:12.141
All right, that's a
five-wheeled chassis tank.

59:12.215 --> 59:14.775
That's not the Mk.1, that's the T-55.

59:14.851 --> 59:17.820
And it and four others are
about 1 2 miles from here.

59:17.887 --> 59:20.151
What do you want tanks in mountains for?

59:20.223 --> 59:22.657
Oh, we don't. I just wanted
you to know I know you got them.

59:22.725 --> 59:26.126
$35.5 million. Which you'll
be able to appropriate.

59:26.329 --> 59:27.353
Yeah.

59:27.430 --> 59:29.398
Without the press
askingquestions about it.

59:29.465 --> 59:30.489
GUS: You know, there's good news there,

59:30.567 --> 59:33.400
because the press is going to be
busy asking about a weekend in Vegas

59:33.469 --> 59:35.835
and his pending arreston
charges of narcoticspossession.

59:35.905 --> 59:38.931
Oh, Gus.Shit, Charlie.

59:39.008 --> 59:41.067
It's nothing. Is this true?

59:41.144 --> 59:43.237
No, for our purposes,
it doesn't really matter.

59:43.313 --> 59:44.974
Thank you. I was just explaining to him

59:45.048 --> 59:47.175
that as long as the press sees
sex and drugs behind the left hand,

59:47.250 --> 59:48.945
you can park a battle
carrier behind the right hand

59:49.018 --> 59:50.280
and no one's gonna fucking notice.

59:50.353 --> 59:51.479
What the hell happened?

59:51.554 --> 59:53.419
It's not germane. It's
not germane to these people

59:53.489 --> 59:56.925
who are fighting and dying, and
being massacred in their homes.

59:56.993 --> 01:00:00.019
Now, for the love of Christ,
will you help us help them

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:01.996
shoot down these fucking helicopters?

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.764
I love you, Charlie,

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.570
but you are a grown man

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:14.707
who still hasn't learned to look both
ways before he crosses the fucking street!

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:22.683
Yes, I'm in.

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:28.050
But I don't like this
guy. I know how you feel.

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:32.594
ZVl: What happens now?
You come with us to Cairo.

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:34.960
This meeting's gonna be run
professional? Oh, absolutely.

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:37.056
We'll be talking  to the
Deputy Defense Minister

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:40.432
while his boss gets a belly
dance from a friend of Charlie's.

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.562
What? A good friend
of mine back in Texas

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:43.833
is a well-known belly dancer.

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:47.501
It's always been her dream to
perform in Egypt, so she's our way in.

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:51.479
While she's dancing for the Defense
Minster, we'll be talking to the Deputy.

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:53.879
Oh, my God. No, she's
supposed to be good.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:01:00.686
(ARABIC MUSIC PLAYING)

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:32.750
That's an extraordinary woman. Oh, yeah.

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:39.687
That's not any belly
dance I'm familiar with.

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:43.061
That's why I wanted the
Defense Minister to see her.

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:46.894
This is your girlfriend? Carol's
a friend. She's an old friend.

01:01:46.969 --> 01:01:50.530
I understand her father didn't allow
dancing because of the religion?

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:53.268
Yeah, that's correct.

01:01:53.342 --> 01:01:54.809
And what religion is that?

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.742
You know, she's a Baptist.

01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:03.177
As I was saying, the Russians will
learn, I'm quite afraid the hard way,

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:05.743
to fear God's vengeance upon those

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:09.519
who oppress his humble servants
who submit to him in Islam.

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:12.624
Their skulls will
hang from the treetops.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:16.324
You can do whatever you like
with their skulls, I suppose.

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:22.404
What has Gus here concerned is a SA
surface-to-air missiles you all have.

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.201
For some reason, he thinks
they were stored poorly.

01:02:24.273 --> 01:02:26.764
No, no, no, the SA-7
s were stored properly.

01:02:26.843 --> 01:02:30.540
Excuse me. What about the
oppression of my people?

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:32.274
Oh, Zvi. I beg your pardon?

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:33.815
Fellows, we have to do this now.

01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:38.411
I am about to arrange for
$35 million worth of guns

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.080
to be put into the hands of Muslims!

01:02:40.156 --> 01:02:43.489
I meant no disrespect. Oh, really?

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:46.119
CHARLIE: Well, anyway, that...
None of this is important.

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:49.164
You have Soviet-licensed factories
that can put out Kalashnikovs

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:51.166
at a rate of 25,000 a week?

01:02:51.234 --> 01:02:54.328
That's correct. What
about city warfare devices?

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:56.462
What kind? Bicycle bombs, limpet mines,

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:57.801
plastic, tripwire mines?

01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:00.001
Yes, yes. Whatever you need.

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:04.108
CHARLIE: We can't improve the price now,

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:07.638
but when we come back for
more, we'll make it up to you.

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:08.978
I agree.

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:11.016
All right.

01:03:21.497 --> 01:03:25.058
Hey, you did good back there
ignoring the religious shit.

01:03:25.968 --> 01:03:27.902
'Cause these people are
totally fucking unspooled,

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.871
and I'm not just talking
about the Muslims.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.831
Zvi's all right. Oh, I know he is.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:35.303
He is Mossad, by the way.

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:38.541
What I'm talking about
is your friend in Houston.

01:03:38.815 --> 01:03:42.876
Now, she's got to stop throwing fundraisers
and she's got to stop doing press.

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:45.512
Joanne is raising awareness.

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:46.953
(CHUCKLES)

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:52.721
She's using a non-secular vocabulary

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:55.587
and framing this as a religious war.

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:58.963
And America doesn't
fight religious wars.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:00.127
(SIGHING)

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:02.671
Is that right? Yeah, that's
why I like living there.

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:05.536
FLIGHT CAPTAIN.: Good morning' ladies
and gentlemen. This is your captain.

01:04:05.641 --> 01:04:07.438
We will begin our initial descent

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:10.877
into Washington Dulles Airport.
I got to go down to Houston, so...

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:12.972
...I would like to thank you and hope...

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:15.950
Well, talk to her.
Yeah, I'll talk to her.

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:21.923
You want me to go into
business with the Israelis?

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:24.289
Just for this one purpose,
yes, Mr. President.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.888
The Israelis have the largest stockpile
of Soviet-made weapons in friendly hands.

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:30.364
I know that.

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:34.536
I need to trust that this
arrangement will remain secret.

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:38.904
Pakistan and Israel would have to
appear to be enemies in the public eye.

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:41.443
Yeah, I don't think that's a tough sell.

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.239
You have authority to do this?

01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:46.406
None whatsoever. In fact, I'm pretty
close to violating the Logan Act.

01:04:46.482 --> 01:04:48.347
Well, I don't know what that is.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.816
But, Charlie. Yes, sir.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.787
If I see one fucking Star
of David on a crate...

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:54.652
You won't. I promise.

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:57.650
Hey. Excuse me.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:00.491
You want me to take a
look at those remarks?

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.588
Why? Just... Well, your introduction,

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:06.999
want me to look it over? It's an
introduction, Charlie. I'll be fine.

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:18.473
Today we honor President
Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan.

01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:21.575
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:35.859
Before we go any further' I
would like you all to know this'

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:38.599
President Zia did not kill Bhutto.

01:05:39.802 --> 01:05:41.497
In the time that he's been President'

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:44.505
the fortunes of Pakistan
have changed radically.

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:45.801
I've asked you all here today...

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:49.234
(CROWD CHATTERING)

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.644
(CUTLERY CLINKING)

01:05:54.183 --> 01:05:56.276
You disappeared.

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.476
Well, they weren't
selling alcohol in there.

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:01.022
It's a traditional Pakistani gathering.

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:02.887
You think they might be
a lot happier over there

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:06.326
if they could just get women and booze
in the same room at the same time?

01:06:06.395 --> 01:06:08.192
I think they'd be a whole
lot happier over there

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:09.731
if the Communists got out.

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:12.359
"Zia did not kill Bhutto."

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:16.293
That's not something you usually
hear in introductory remarks.

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:19.830
He didn't, Charlie. Bhutto had
a trial and was found guilty.

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:21.536
Shocking verdict.

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:24.972
What did you need to talk to me about?

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:29.545
Joanne, darling, dial down the religion.

01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:32.217
What? It could alienate people

01:06:32.288 --> 01:06:34.017
whose support we need.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.786
It's luncheons like this that
are raising the money we need.

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:39.726
This thing is not gonna get
done by ballrooms full of people

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:41.023
in the Houstonian Hotel.

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:44.464
It's gonna get done by the
CIA, Israel, Egypt and Pakistan,

01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:46.160
and it's gonna get done quietly.

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:47.600
Now, you start making people think

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.138
we're trying to convert
everybody to Christianity.

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:53.403
I was saved by Jesus Christ,
Charlie, and I am not ashamed of it.

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:56.707
My fervor is not about religion,
it's about freedom of religion,

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:57.837
which we have, they want,

01:06:57.913 --> 01:07:00.177
and the Communists are
slaughtering them for.

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:03.548
And I get it. Just tamp down the fervor.

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:07.454
Well, I can't modulate
God's will, sweetie.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.089
You can try.

01:07:09.992 --> 01:07:13.587
Now, I got to get back to D.C. They've
set up a briefing for me at Langley.

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:16.028
On what? On getting the guns.

01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:20.458
Afghanistan's barely a country.

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:22.800
There's no phones or
roads outside the cities.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.305
It's likely that a
villager would live his life

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.933
without having contact with another
village just three miles down the road

01:07:27.009 --> 01:07:29.068
unless he was going to war against them.

01:07:29.145 --> 01:07:31.773
Now, my thinking is instead
of 400,000 sloppy guys,

01:07:31.847 --> 01:07:35.544
we concentrate on several elite
forces totaling about 150,000.

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:37.108
Give these guys real training,

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:40.121
20 different courses covering
irregular warfare disciplines.

01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:41.713
GUS: And do you have anybody in mind?

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:44.885
The most successful rebels
today are in the Panjshir Valley.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.451
They're called the United Front
of the Council of the North.

01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:49.588
We've earmarked them
for 10 million in weapons

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:52.259
and 10 to 15 agency
advisors for training.

01:07:52.334 --> 01:07:55.394
CHARLIE: Who's their
leader? Ahmed Shah Massoud.

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:58.929
He's Tajik, so he's not
well liked by the Pashtun.

01:07:59.008 --> 01:08:02.171
CHARLIE: So the... What, the Tajiks
have a problem with the Pashtuns?

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:04.405
Well, they say when a Tajik
wants to make love to a woman,

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.278
his first choice is
always a Pashtun man.

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:11.208
It's funnier in the original Pashto.

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:15.218
All right, I've heard enough.
I'm going to go get our money.

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:17.790
All right, don't fuck us up now.

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:19.787
Awesome pep talk.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:24.127
Afghanistan, Egypt,
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:26.997
these are all
totalitarian dictatorships.

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:31.506
And they'd like to blow the only democracy
in the region right into the Mediterranean.

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:34.634
Now, you heard me say that
Israel's gonna be on board.

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:37.406
Oh, well, Zvi Rafiah's out of his mind.

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:41.742
These people are draconian thugs,
and in an evil and twisted derby

01:08:41.817 --> 01:08:44.183
between the Communists
and the Fundamentalists,

01:08:44.252 --> 01:08:45.810
it's 6-to-5 and pick them,
as far as I'm concerned.

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:48.287
No, you're wrong about that, Doc,
and you know you don't mean it.

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:52.157
In Pakistan, a blind girl gets
raped, but there's a witness.

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:54.719
Now, in Pakistan it
takes four witnesses.

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:57.231
So the rapist walks away
and the girl is in prison.

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:58.823
Can you tell me why?

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:01.631
Well, fornication. That's right.

01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:04.729
Mr. Chairman, President Zia is the
only one willing to shoulder the risk

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:07.970
of actively training and
funding the mujahideen

01:09:08.042 --> 01:09:09.408
while Egypt and Saudi Arabia...

01:09:09.478 --> 01:09:12.207
Now, the Saudis are matching
any funding from Congress?

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:14.805
That's right. So when
you say 40 million to me,

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:16.112
you're really talking about 80 million.

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.310
Only 40 from us.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.479
You want to put $80 million
in the hands of these people?

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:21.682
No, see, Doc, now, if you took
a trip with me to the border,

01:09:21.756 --> 01:09:23.452
you'd stop calling them "these people."

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:27.018
They are farmers and children mostly,
and they are fighting our enemies for us.

01:09:27.095 --> 01:09:28.586
I know. And that should
be impossible for America.

01:09:28.663 --> 01:09:30.564
I know. It should be
impossible for America

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:34.194
to sit on the bench while little kids
and their mothers fight our enemies.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:37.103
Now, all you have to do to
change that is to support me

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:38.640
in the Committee, Mr. Chairman.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:43.041
I'm sorry, Charlie, but doubling
from 5 to 10 million is one thing,

01:09:43.112 --> 01:09:45.876
but, you know, I just
can't get behind this.

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.415
(PHONE RINGING)

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:51.881
TRISH: Joanne Herring's
residence. Who's speaking?

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:54.752
Miss Herring, Congressman
Wilson for you.

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:58.692
Hello. CHARLIE.: Hey.

01:09:58.827 --> 01:09:59.919
Tell me what's happening.

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:03.123
Well, I need Doc Long, and
he's not getting on board.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:06.225
Now, he's a church-going
guy, so I thought,

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:08.361
you know' maybe you
could... So now you need God.

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:11.202
Yeah. Let me give you his private line.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.039
I've got it.

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:14.700
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:16.071
Trish! Yes, ma'am.

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:18.136
Boss? Yeah.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:21.342
Hey, that's a nice
sweater. Oh, thank you.

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:23.885
The Washington Times wants to
know if you've ever been in rehab.

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:25.944
Well, what are you gonna tell
them? That you won't go to rehab

01:10:26.021 --> 01:10:27.283
'cause they don't serve whiskey there.

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:29.517
Well, that's why you're the
press secretary, boo-boo.

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:32.755
I've got Stu on the line.
Can you jump on? Yeah.

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:34.689
Hey, Stu, it's me.

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.261
All right.

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:40.161
No, she's not a stripper, Stu.
She just posed for the cover...

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:42.033
Oh, what the hell
difference does it make?

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:44.095
They're talking to Crystal today.

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:45.265
Yeah.

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:47.966
Giuliani subpoenaed the limo driver.

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:49.971
Oh, that's what Gus said he'd do.

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:52.138
Well, the limo driver said
he didn't see anything.

01:10:52.214 --> 01:10:53.340
He didn't see anything.

01:10:53.415 --> 01:10:55.542
So Giuliani subpoenaed every limo driver

01:10:55.618 --> 01:11:00.817
between Arlington and Silver Spring to see
if any of them can recall you using cocaine.

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:04.921
Joanne Herring's on the phone. Hey, you.

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:06.524
We're all leaving in the morning.

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:07.994
You're kidding? No.

01:11:08.697 --> 01:11:10.892
Well, what did you have to promise him?

01:11:10.966 --> 01:11:13.434
There's a blind girl in
jail 'cause she was raped.

01:11:13.502 --> 01:11:14.992
Yeah. You're gonna get her out.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:17.398
What, I got to bust
