WEBVTT

00:45.963 --> 00:48.006
My name is Alice.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.551
I worked for
the Umbrella Corporation...

00:50.718 --> 00:54.972
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.473
I was head of security...

00:56.640 --> 01:01.270
...at a secret high-tech facility
caIled The Hive...

01:01.437 --> 01:05.691
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimental...

01:05.858 --> 01:07.609
...viral weaponry.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.194
But there was an incident.

01:09.361 --> 01:13.157
The virus escaped
and everybody died.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.160
Trouble was...

01:16.326 --> 01:18.454
...they didn't stay dead.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.915
The T-virus reanimated their bodies.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.380
But I survived.
Myself and one other...

01:28.547 --> 01:30.340
...an environmentalist named Matt.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.178
When we emerged, we were
seized by Umbrella scientists.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.721
Matt and l were separated.

01:35.888 --> 01:38.515
He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.

01:38.891 --> 01:39.933
Matt!

01:43.312 --> 01:45.522
Take her to the
Raccoon City facility...

01:45.689 --> 01:47.441
...and assembIe the team.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.193
We're reopening The Hive.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.779
I want to know
what went on down there.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.698
We thought we'd
survived the horror.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.829
But we were wrong.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.842
You're watching Raccoon 7.
Now the weather, with Terri Morales.

02:14.009 --> 02:17.387
lt's 6:10 in the a.m. and already
the temperature has reached...

02:17.554 --> 02:21.058
...a massive 92 degrees as this
unprecedented heat wave continues.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.854
Clear skies in Raccoon City and a
light breeze coming in from the west.

02:26.021 --> 02:31.318
And as a special bonus just for you,
we have a pollen count of 0.7.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.654
That's a record low
for this time of year.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.657
Good news for all you hay fever
and asthma sufferers.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.661
All in all, it Iooks Iike it's gonna be
another beautiful day.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.538
Stay with us. After the break...

02:42.704 --> 02:45.666
...we're gonna look at your favorite
holiday hot spots.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.112
Advance team, proceed.

03:25.414 --> 03:26.915
Sir.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.629
Holy shit.

04:14.004 --> 04:17.173
Excuse us, ma'am.
There's been an incident.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.947
Excuse us, sir.
There's been an incident.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.115
How bad is it?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.785
-You must come with us.
-l must get my daughter.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.079
-lt's taken care of.
-What are you doing?

04:47.245 --> 04:49.706
You don't understand.
She's Ieft for schooI.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.043
This is U-Gamma 7,
evacuation complete...

05:35.210 --> 05:38.422
...but we just Iost contact
with Gamma 12.

06:10.370 --> 06:14.249
Unit 12 calIing for immediate backup
at city halI.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.794
Still no explanation for this wave
of unexplained killings...

06:17.961 --> 06:20.213
...that is sweeping across the city.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.887
A deadly crime spree with no end.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.597
Backup, we need backup now!

06:28.764 --> 06:31.892
Just Iike Valentine told us....

06:32.059 --> 06:35.729
Off-duty law enforcement personnel,
report for duty immediately.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.614
Give us a hand over here,
this guy's insane!

06:54.748 --> 06:56.583
-lt's Valentine.
-Hold your fire.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.335
-Valentine!
-They're infected.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.837
Somebody get this ugIy bitch
off of me!

07:01.588 --> 07:03.298
l told you. Shoot for the head.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.675
PIease, somebody get her.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.638
No! Don't shoot! Don't--

07:10.764 --> 07:13.016
l'm leaving town.
l suggest you do the same.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.684
Everyone's leaving the city.

07:14.851 --> 07:17.437
We've received reports
of Umbrella Corporation...

07:17.604 --> 07:20.023
...dispatching armed guards
and troop carriers.

08:50.614 --> 08:54.618
Move in an orderIy fashion
to security checkpoints.

08:56.786 --> 09:00.123
The city is compIetely contained.
Troops have sealed all exits.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.958
The onIy way out is this bridge.

09:02.125 --> 09:05.128
All citizens must pass through
medical scanning.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.131
Sir! You better take a look at this.

09:08.298 --> 09:11.718
Family members must pass through
security checkpoints together.

09:13.929 --> 09:18.308
Please proceed in an orderly fashion.
Do not run.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.481
-He's clean. Let him pass.
-Next!

09:24.648 --> 09:26.983
No pushing, please. Keep in line.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.612
Can we get some
reinforcements down here?

09:31.738 --> 09:33.114
Chopper Delta, new orders.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.325
Proceed directly to
Ravens Gate Bridge.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.160
Reinforcements urgently needed.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.412
Copy that, base. On our way.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.313
Get it.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.899
No! Get off!

10:08.066 --> 10:11.820
Get away! No! Stop! Get off!

10:30.880 --> 10:32.674
No! Get back!

10:34.217 --> 10:36.553
Civilian in trouble. Three o'cIock.
Go down.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.305
l can't. We have our orders.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.724
No! Get back! No!

10:40.890 --> 10:43.059
They're gonna kilI her!
Take us down now!

10:43.226 --> 10:45.020
She's a civilian. We have orders.

10:49.566 --> 10:50.859
Fuck orders!

10:52.360 --> 10:53.695
Nicholai, tie me off.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.364
Get back! No!

10:56.531 --> 10:58.908
Wait!

11:12.589 --> 11:14.257
Now!

11:20.055 --> 11:21.806
Take us down! Down, now!

11:29.397 --> 11:31.066
Hey. Hey, you okay?

11:33.109 --> 11:35.779
Step away from the edge.
Come over to me.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.782
-Everything's okay.
-No, it's not.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.453
l've seen what happens to you
once you've been bitten.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.374
-We can help you.
-There's no going back.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.958
No!

12:04.599 --> 12:07.185
Move! Peyton!

12:08.395 --> 12:11.314
-Peyton!
-Valentine. Hey, Valentine.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.650
-Move! Police! Move!
-Let her through.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.696
GIad you're here.
We could use the heIp.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.994
-He has a weak heart.
-Get away from him!

12:25.495 --> 12:26.788
Everybody, stand back!

12:27.789 --> 12:29.749
-Daddy!
-Get away from him!

12:29.916 --> 12:31.793
-Get her away from him!
-lt's okay.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.045
-Get her away!
-lt's okay. Come on.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.632
-Daddy!
-lt's okay, l got you.

12:41.344 --> 12:44.055
-Get him off! Get him off me!
-Move aside!

12:44.264 --> 12:45.306
Get back!

12:50.895 --> 12:53.690
lt's here. lt's reached the gate.

12:56.734 --> 13:00.155
Why are you here? You shouId've
got out while you had the chance.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.365
These are our peopIe, JilI.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.828
-Close them.
-Sir?

13:07.162 --> 13:08.371
Seal the gates.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.790
-Our men are still out there--
-Just do it.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.503
Oh, my God, they're closing
the gates!

13:36.274 --> 13:39.903
This is a biohazard quarantine area.

13:40.069 --> 13:44.157
Due to risk of infection, you cannot
be alIowed to leave the city.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.201
What the fuck is going on here?

13:46.367 --> 13:49.120
AIl appropriate measures
are being taken.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.581
The situation is under control.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.750
PIease return to your homes.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.710
You won't get away with this!

14:00.048 --> 14:02.091
Let us out!

14:07.388 --> 14:09.390
You have five seconds
to turn around...

14:09.766 --> 14:11.267
...and return to the city.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.105
Do it.

14:16.272 --> 14:20.944
Use of live ammunition
has been authorized.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.737
Five.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.032
-They can't shoot people!
-They won't fire.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.951
Three.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.327
-Get them back!
-Two.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.746
-Move!
-One.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.462
Everybody, clear out!

15:06.906 --> 15:10.159
Kilo and Romeo squads,
rendezvous at sector 01...

15:10.326 --> 15:11.995
...and secure against enemy.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.603
-Grenade!
-Grenade!

15:42.692 --> 15:45.820
Squads three to seven
are on fuIl retreat.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.408
No, sir. Suppression measures
have faiIed. We can't contain it.

15:50.575 --> 15:53.870
The infection is spreading faster
than anyone anticipated.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.705
Dr. Ashford.

15:57.248 --> 16:00.126
-ShouIdn't you be on the chopper?
-l'm not going.

16:00.293 --> 16:04.130
l was instructed to get you and
the other scientists out of the hot zone.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.716
You're too important to UmbrelIa
to be at risk.

16:06.883 --> 16:10.219
l'm not leaving without my daughter.

16:10.887 --> 16:13.890
l'm sorry, truly.
But the city is sealed.

16:14.057 --> 16:17.560
She may have survived the crash,
but we couldn't find her anywhere.

16:18.019 --> 16:20.813
Even if she were still alive,
l couIdn't let her out.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.567
The risk of infection is too great.
You must understand.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.154
You do what you have to do.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.656
l'm staying.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.781
There has to be someone Ieft alive.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.658
Come on.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.886
-Matt!
-Take her to the Raccoon City facility.

18:57.428 --> 19:00.056
I want her quarantined.
Close observation.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.230
Prepare her for exposure.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.737
Up the dosage.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.074
Just do it.

19:36.592 --> 19:37.885
We'll rest up soon.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.846
Don't worry about me.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.765
What the fuck is going on?
They were shooting on people.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.267
lnnocent people.

19:44.559 --> 19:47.687
Why didn't you guys do something?
You're the police.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.647
lnside.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.024
lnside.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.151
Let's get under cover.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.813
You have to get out.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.316
This is my place. l'm hiding here.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.193
-lt's big enough for all of us.
-Don't teIl me--

20:36.360 --> 20:40.281
Okay, just cooI it. Put the gun down.

20:42.992 --> 20:46.078
Put the gun down.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.249
And, you, take it easy.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.502
There's plenty of ways to get
yourself kilIed here...

20:53.669 --> 20:56.672
...without getting yourseIf shot.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.720
JilI Valentine, right?

21:03.346 --> 21:05.848
Remember me?
l covered some of your cases...

21:06.974 --> 21:08.267
...before your suspension.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.354
Terri MoraIes, Raccoon 7.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.065
l've seen aIl your work.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.525
A fan.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.446
Not realIy.
You do the weather now, right?

21:22.657 --> 21:24.825
This is Sergeant Peyton WelIs.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.535
What's that you got there?

21:26.702 --> 21:28.704
My Emmy.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.790
That's if any of us make it out.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.709
So does the Raccoon City
PoIice Department...

21:33.876 --> 21:37.046
...have any comment
on what those things are?

21:37.213 --> 21:40.049
The Lord's judgment!

21:40.216 --> 21:44.428
Behold, l wilI bring evil
upon this peopIe...

21:44.595 --> 21:48.099
...for they have not hearkened
unto my words, nor my law...

21:48.516 --> 21:51.227
...but have rejected it.

21:51.394 --> 21:54.730
Awake, ye that dweIl in dust.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.733
The dead shalI walk amongst
the living...

21:58.067 --> 22:01.404
...and bring damnation unto them.

22:02.196 --> 22:03.948
That's quite a speech.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.909
That was great.
That's gonna make the finaI cut.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.248
-What was that?
-lt's nothing.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.295
Are you aIl right?

23:09.346 --> 23:11.140
What are you doing?

23:12.183 --> 23:14.268
What's wrong?

23:14.435 --> 23:16.896
lt's my sister. She's not well.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.314
-Maybe l can help.
-No.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.524
Out of my way.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.360
Just get out.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.286
You're feeding her? You're sick.

23:34.789 --> 23:36.165
Just Ieave us alone.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.627
No!

23:45.341 --> 23:47.176
-l'm getting out of here.
-Hey.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.512
Hey! Hey, no!

Hey, help us! Come on!

24:02.483 --> 24:05.027
Get it in there! Get it in there!

24:15.788 --> 24:17.748
What the hell was that?

24:27.758 --> 24:29.552
There!

24:34.223 --> 24:35.891
Jesus.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.769
-What the fuck is that thing?
-What are you doing?

24:38.936 --> 24:40.729
Get back here.

26:48.565 --> 26:50.567
Peyton.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.653
Terri.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.079
Peyton.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.876

27:08.210 --> 27:09.420
The lrish dude.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.547
No, he's Scottish.

27:11.714 --> 27:13.215
Was.

27:14.508 --> 27:16.343
l count three of them.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.263
They got us boxed in.

27:19.430 --> 27:21.140
What are we gonna do?

27:21.849 --> 27:23.309
You wanna pray for help?

27:23.475 --> 27:25.436
Let's go.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.124
Jesus.

27:47.291 --> 27:50.919
We're gonna need
more ammo. l'm out.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.392
Shit. l'm out.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.039
Move.

29:38.152 --> 29:40.779
Who the fuck are you?

29:47.369 --> 29:48.871
GTA, motherfucker!

29:50.706 --> 29:51.957
Oh, yeah!

29:52.291 --> 29:54.126
Ten points!

29:56.712 --> 29:58.505
You stiIl Iooking good, baby.

29:58.672 --> 30:01.383
l'll spend 5 dolIars
on your stanking ass.

30:38.212 --> 30:39.505
Yuri. You okay?

30:41.798 --> 30:43.592
Bite this.

30:58.649 --> 31:01.276
-You okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.965
PuIl back! PuIl back!

31:40.649 --> 31:41.900
This way.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.907
This is Olivera. We've been overrun.
Request immediate chopper evac.

32:20.564 --> 32:23.025
And what the fuck
are we doing here?

32:23.191 --> 32:25.027
Hello?

32:25.736 --> 32:30.532
Am l the only one who's noticing
that we're in a graveyard, peopIe?

32:30.699 --> 32:32.576
Okay, what's the plan?

32:32.743 --> 32:34.536
Stay alive.

32:34.703 --> 32:38.206
-That's it? That's it?
-That's it.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.585
We need to find somewhere
to stop for a moment.

32:41.752 --> 32:43.503
l don't think that's a good idea.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.339
There might be more of those...

32:45.505 --> 32:46.506
...things.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.134
lf there were more,
we'd have seen them by now.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.803
-You know what they are?
-They're bio-weapons...

32:51.970 --> 32:53.972
...from Umbrella labs
beneath the city.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.767
How come you know so much
about UmbrelIa?

32:56.933 --> 32:58.602
l used to work for them.

32:59.394 --> 33:00.979
Damn it.

33:01.396 --> 33:02.814
Hold it.

33:03.899 --> 33:05.567
What do you think you're doing?

33:05.734 --> 33:08.153
He's wounded.
The infection's spreading.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.571
l'm fine.

33:10.781 --> 33:12.574
You should take care of him now.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.035
lt'll be more difficuIt later.

33:16.286 --> 33:18.747
You know that.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.415
No.

33:20.582 --> 33:22.292
lf it comes to that...

33:22.459 --> 33:25.087
...l'lI take care of it myseIf.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.510
As you wish.

33:33.261 --> 33:35.931
lt's nothing personal.
But in an hour, maybe two...

33:36.098 --> 33:37.641
...you'Il be dead.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.435
And moments later,
you'll become one of them.

33:41.103 --> 33:43.647
You'll endanger your friends,
try to kilI them...

33:44.022 --> 33:46.191
...probabIy succeed.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.530
l'm sorry. That's just the way it is.

34:00.247 --> 34:02.249
Help me!

34:51.922 --> 34:54.092
There's too many of them.

34:54.259 --> 34:55.927
Let's get out of here.
This way!

35:10.108 --> 35:14.196
Sir, T-virus infection
has reached critical levels.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.700
This is a perfect opportunity.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.245
Ensure aIl data streams
are recorded.

35:22.412 --> 35:25.248
Activate Nemesis Program now.

35:58.698 --> 36:02.577
AIpha Team to base.
This is AIpha Team to base.

36:02.744 --> 36:05.747
-Come in, base.
-Hey! Pay attention, soldier.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.251
AIpha Team to base.
This is AIpha Team to base.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.919
Come in, base.

36:11.545 --> 36:14.422
-You stay focused, alI right?
-Yes, sir.

36:14.589 --> 36:17.467
AIpha Team to base.
This is AIpha--

36:17.634 --> 36:19.803
Why don't they respond, Carlos?

36:19.970 --> 36:22.180
-Why don't they evac us, huh?
-l don't know.

36:22.347 --> 36:26.017
Why did they send us in here in
first pIace? We never stood a chance.

36:26.476 --> 36:28.937
-We're not trained for this.
-Wait.

36:29.229 --> 36:30.772
Listen.

36:38.488 --> 36:41.283
-Hey!
-Here! We're down here!

36:41.449 --> 36:43.493
-Hey!
-Come! We're here!

36:44.202 --> 36:48.790
-Where are they going?
-They're Ianding there. Let's get Yuri!

36:48.957 --> 36:53.420
-Come on, Yuri. We're getting out.
-We'lI get you fixed up. Come.

37:10.145 --> 37:13.023
Hold on, Yuri. We're aImost there.

37:14.858 --> 37:17.527
No. No! Don't leave!

37:17.694 --> 37:21.156
-Down here! We're coming!
-They dropped something.

37:21.323 --> 37:23.033
Maybe a radio. One that works.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.993
Take Yuri.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.838
Hold on, Yuri.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.816
Nicholai, put me down.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.443
Okay, rest here.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.574
What is this?

38:48.284 --> 38:51.204
Looks like weapon cases.

38:51.371 --> 38:55.083
We don't need weapons.
We need evacuation!

38:55.250 --> 38:57.877
These weren't meant for us.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.340
Yuri!

39:20.233 --> 39:22.110
PIenty to go around.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.798
Don't shoot!

39:47.469 --> 39:48.928
l got the power.

39:49.095 --> 39:52.390
Thank you! Owe you one, man.

39:56.186 --> 39:57.729
Shit!

39:57.896 --> 39:59.814
Maybe l was safer outside.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.650
Get them guns out of my damn face.

40:05.195 --> 40:06.946
Motherfucker, pIease. Look...

40:07.489 --> 40:09.699
...my shit is custom.

40:20.668 --> 40:22.962
What the fuck is that?

40:35.016 --> 40:36.684
Shit!

40:45.652 --> 40:48.029
You're going down,
you son of a bitch!

40:51.366 --> 40:52.909
Fuck.

41:01.459 --> 41:04.712
Deploy defensive formation.
Take him down.

41:07.674 --> 41:11.344
You fuckers is crazy. Look at that guy,
got a rocket launcher.

41:12.595 --> 41:16.391
-What do we have?
-A dozen armed men. Well organized.

41:24.399 --> 41:27.318
-l'm surprised there's anyone left.
-They're S.T.A.R.S.

41:27.735 --> 41:31.447
Special Tactics and Rescue Squad.
They're the best.

41:32.574 --> 41:33.783
Fire!

41:46.629 --> 41:48.882
Back! Fall back!

41:49.632 --> 41:54.053
-Let's see how good they reaIly are.
-Altering protocoIs.

42:13.114 --> 42:14.490
S.T.A.R.S.

42:21.456 --> 42:23.625
Oh, shit.

42:30.632 --> 42:32.592
Respect.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.693
That's right, motherfucker.

42:50.860 --> 42:52.862
Yeah, l knew you
wasn't gonna do shit.

42:53.029 --> 42:55.531
Punk son of a bitch!

42:57.575 --> 43:00.411
Shit, l'm a bad motherfucker.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.746
l'm a bad mother--

43:02.121 --> 43:04.332
Let me get the fuck up out of here.

43:08.086 --> 43:10.088
What are you staring at?

43:11.839 --> 43:12.840
l'm not sure.

43:13.883 --> 43:16.386
What made you wanna
work for Umbrella?

43:17.387 --> 43:19.597
Girl's gotta make a living.

43:21.182 --> 43:23.559
Those were some pretty slick moves
back there.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.103
l'm good...

43:25.478 --> 43:27.272
...but l'm not that good.

43:27.438 --> 43:30.608
-You should be thankful for that.
-What do you mean?

43:33.361 --> 43:35.071
They did something to me.

43:35.697 --> 43:38.032
l bareIy feel human anymore.

43:40.702 --> 43:44.455
We should keep moving.
Before the sound attracts anything.

43:54.507 --> 43:56.509
Keep moving.

44:09.063 --> 44:12.066
-HelIo?
-God, l thought you'd never answer.

44:12.483 --> 44:15.820
-Who is this?
-l can get you out of the city.

44:16.404 --> 44:17.488
AIl four of you.

44:18.698 --> 44:21.117
But first we have
to come to an arrangement.

44:21.284 --> 44:23.286
Are you ready to make a deal?

44:23.911 --> 44:27.665
-Do we have a choice?
-Not if you want to live past tonight, no.

44:29.334 --> 44:31.085
His name is Dr. Ashford and he--

44:31.252 --> 44:35.298
Runs the genetics and viral research
division of Umbrella Corporation.

44:35.465 --> 44:36.758
What's he want with us?

44:36.924 --> 44:39.385
His daughter, Angela,
is trapped in the city.

44:39.552 --> 44:42.347
Umbrella was to evac her,
but she didn't make it.

44:42.513 --> 44:44.265
She's hiding out in her school.

44:44.432 --> 44:47.268
We find her, he'Il help us escape
the perimeter.

44:47.435 --> 44:48.686
No fucking deal.

44:48.853 --> 44:51.814
We find the building with
the thickest walls and doors...

44:51.981 --> 44:55.276
...and we barricade ourselves in.
Sit tight, wait for help.

44:55.443 --> 44:57.528
There won't be any help.

44:57.695 --> 45:00.448
Umbrella knows
they can't contain the infection.

45:00.615 --> 45:04.869
So at sunrise this morning, Raccoon
City will be completeIy sanitized.

45:07.288 --> 45:09.248
What do you mean by "sanitized"?

45:09.957 --> 45:11.876
A precision tacticaI nuclear device.

45:12.043 --> 45:15.004
-What yield?
-Five kilotons.

45:16.214 --> 45:17.298
-Fuck me.
-Stupid.

45:17.465 --> 45:22.303
-What does that mean?
-lt means it'll destroy the infection...

45:23.096 --> 45:25.139
...and all evidence of it.

45:26.307 --> 45:28.935
lt's buIlshit. lt's bullshit!

45:29.102 --> 45:31.437
No fucking way would they
get away with that!

45:31.604 --> 45:34.273
-lt would be alI over the fucking news!
-Cover-up.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.067
Cover-up's aIready prepared.

45:36.442 --> 45:39.070
A meItdown
at the nucIear power plant.

45:39.237 --> 45:42.907
-A tragic accident.
-Not even Umbrella is capabIe of this.

45:43.074 --> 45:44.659
Not capable?

45:44.826 --> 45:47.203
Peyton, you were there at the bridge.

45:47.703 --> 45:51.332
You know exactly how far
Umbrella will go.

45:55.086 --> 45:57.130
So, what do we do now, huh?

45:58.339 --> 46:01.384
l think we should be out of here
by sunrise.

46:07.181 --> 46:10.768
What if there is no way out and he's
watching us on these cameras...

46:10.935 --> 46:13.146
...like this is some kind
of sick game?

46:15.106 --> 46:17.108
-What is it?
-What's going on?

46:17.275 --> 46:19.777
-Wait.
-Sunrise ain't gonna wait.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.446
No.

46:22.155 --> 46:25.199
-There's something down there.
-Where?

46:26.701 --> 46:28.202
There.

46:28.369 --> 46:29.579
l don't see anything.

46:29.745 --> 46:33.374
That doesn't alter the fact that
there is something down there.

46:33.541 --> 46:36.169
l'm getting sick of this bullshit!

46:36.335 --> 46:37.712
Peyton!

46:42.633 --> 46:43.885
No!

46:45.970 --> 46:48.639
He's Iocated another two
S.T.A.R.S. members.

46:51.726 --> 46:53.352
Nemesis.

46:54.061 --> 46:56.731
Run. Just go!

47:04.989 --> 47:07.408
Primary target is identified.

47:07.575 --> 47:10.661
Gentlemen, this is what
we've been waiting for.

47:12.580 --> 47:15.208
Confirm at 2:18 and 27 seconds.

47:15.374 --> 47:18.794
The Nemesis Program is now
fully activated.

49:58.746 --> 50:01.582
Look, l'm--
l'm sorry about your friend.

50:04.377 --> 50:07.963
Let's just get to the school
and find this kid.

50:14.929 --> 50:16.263
Peyton!

50:43.791 --> 50:45.292
This bite...

50:45.459 --> 50:47.128
...it won't stop bleeding.

50:48.129 --> 50:50.965
-Why didn't they see us?
-What?

50:51.465 --> 50:55.219
The chopper. We were right there
in the street in front of the hospitaI.

50:55.386 --> 50:58.055
-How could they not see us?
-They saw us.

50:58.848 --> 51:00.641
What do you mean?

51:01.809 --> 51:04.061
We're assets, Nicholai.

51:04.228 --> 51:06.063
Expendable assets.

51:08.274 --> 51:09.900
And we've just been expended.

51:24.665 --> 51:25.833
Stop!

51:26.625 --> 51:28.210
l'm not one of those things.

51:28.377 --> 51:32.673
Hey, remember me? Look, l haven't
been bitten or anything. Look.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.385
Climb aboard.

51:38.012 --> 51:40.389
Lloyd Jefferson Wade.

51:40.556 --> 51:43.809
You can calI me L.J. on account
of the informal situation.

52:30.397 --> 52:32.983
We're gonna have to spIit up
to search this place.

52:33.150 --> 52:37.238
Forget it. Forget it! l'm not going
out there by myself.

52:37.404 --> 52:39.323
l can go with you.

52:39.490 --> 52:41.450
You, take the first fIoor.

52:41.617 --> 52:43.994
You, take the second.

52:44.161 --> 52:45.996
l'll take the basement.

52:46.163 --> 52:49.375
-l've never shot a gun before.
-There's nothing to it.

52:49.875 --> 52:52.586
Point, puIl, repeat.

52:53.295 --> 52:54.797
Try to hit them in the head.

53:19.196 --> 53:20.656
Point...

53:22.408 --> 53:23.993
...puIl...

53:25.995 --> 53:27.705
...repeat.

53:29.456 --> 53:34.545
Point, puIl, repeat.

54:30.851 --> 54:32.227
l see you, mother--

54:33.103 --> 54:34.605
Oh, shit!

54:38.359 --> 54:39.568
EIvis!

54:39.735 --> 54:41.862
So did you get the calI as well?

54:42.488 --> 54:44.573
-What?
-You're here for the girI?

54:44.740 --> 54:46.867
Oh, yeah, yeah. The girI.

54:47.284 --> 54:50.371
Dr. Ashford didn't say he made a deal
with someone else.

54:50.537 --> 54:52.039
l guess we're partners.

54:58.337 --> 54:59.880
Shit.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.575
Angela?

55:30.536 --> 55:32.788
lt's gonna be okay.

55:33.580 --> 55:35.499
There's no need to be afraid.

55:38.419 --> 55:40.087
We're gonna take you home.

55:43.924 --> 55:45.592
Oh, my God.

55:50.764 --> 55:52.433
Help me!

56:08.240 --> 56:09.867
Terri?

56:28.802 --> 56:30.929
You can't help her.

56:32.181 --> 56:33.849
Not now.

56:35.476 --> 56:37.519
l've seen what they do.

56:38.312 --> 56:40.814
-Are you Angela?
-Yes.

56:40.981 --> 56:43.567
We should hurry
before they come back.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.196
Hold this.

56:52.743 --> 56:54.495
Angela Ashford, huh?

56:54.870 --> 56:57.331
That's a pretty grown-up name
for a littIe girI.

56:57.498 --> 56:59.416
l'm not a Iittle girl.

56:59.792 --> 57:01.335
Besides...

57:01.835 --> 57:05.255
-...all my friends call me Angie.
-Angie, huh?

57:06.215 --> 57:07.674
l Iike that.

57:12.346 --> 57:13.847
Those things are in here.

57:14.014 --> 57:16.850
lt's okay, honey. They're slow.
We can run around them.

57:17.351 --> 57:18.977
No.

57:19.353 --> 57:21.021
Not them.

57:21.688 --> 57:23.524
Them.

57:26.527 --> 57:28.237
Get back.

57:54.847 --> 57:56.723
Stay.

57:57.266 --> 57:58.892
Thought you might need a hand.

57:59.059 --> 58:01.728
-You work for Umbrella?
-Used to.

58:01.895 --> 58:08.235
Until they left us for dead in this pIace.
Now l consider myseIf freelance.

58:09.319 --> 58:13.157
Sergeant Nicholai Genovev,
at your service.

58:15.242 --> 58:16.827
-Come on!
-Wait! Angie!

58:16.994 --> 58:19.246
Save the girI! l've got this bitch.

58:28.922 --> 58:29.923
Oh, shit.

58:37.973 --> 58:40.309
From now on, stay right beside me.

58:42.603 --> 58:44.188
lt's bIocked.

58:45.689 --> 58:47.232
What do we do now?

58:59.953 --> 59:02.623
Wait here. Eyes:

59:03.165 --> 59:04.708
Okay?

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:33.005
Thank you.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.424
You two know each other?

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:39.511
She's infected.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.931
She's infected on a massive leveI.

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:46.768
-How can you know that?
-Because she is too.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:50.689
You're infected? When were
you gonna telI us that?

01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:58.905
-Let me see.
-No.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.162
You know l'm not gonna hurt you.

01:01:06.288 --> 01:01:07.581
Let me see.

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:31.605
lt's the antivirus,
the cure to the T-virus.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.024
There's a cure?

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.692
How did you get this?

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:39.321
My daddy.
My daddy made it for me.

01:01:39.488 --> 01:01:42.866
He's sick.
And someday, l'lI get sick too.

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:45.786
He just wanted to stop that.

01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:47.704
When l was little...

01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:49.790
...I had to walk on crutches.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:53.418
They said I'd never get better,
just worse.

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:58.507
He found a way
to make me stronger.

01:01:58.673 --> 01:02:00.634
The T-virus.

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:04.471
Then they took the invention
away from him.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:06.264
Get out of my house!

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:15.690
He's not a bad man.

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:18.402
He didn't mean for any of this.

01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:21.655
lt's okay.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:32.916
Don't shoot! He's cooI.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.752
He made a deaI with Dr. Doom,
same as you.

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:40.924
How many of you guys are there?

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:42.843
What do you mean?

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.348
Nicholai.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.396
When were you bitten?

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:56.273
-Three hours ago.
-What the--?

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:02.362
lt's your lucky day.

01:03:05.407 --> 01:03:09.536
Should have told me you got bit.
l'm hanging with you and shit.

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:17.127
-Let me speak to my daughter.
-First, you tell us how we're getting out.

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:20.839
There's a helicopter
already being prepped.

01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:23.758
lt takes off in 47 minutes.

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:28.138
It'll be the last transport to leave
Raccoon City before they detonate.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:31.057
l take it this helicopter isn't
laid out just for us.

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:34.478
No. lt has another purpose,
but it'll be lightly guarded.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:38.607
-Where's the evac site?
-May l speak to my daughter now?

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:45.489
-Daddy?
-Hey, sweetheart.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:48.283
-Are you all right?
-When can l see you?

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:50.911
Soon. These people will
bring you to see me.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.746
I'll see you very soon.

01:03:52.913 --> 01:03:54.581
Put the lady back on.

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.000
Where do we have to go?

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:59.294
The heIicopter wiIl be at city hall.

01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:01.546
I suggest you make haste.

01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:11.056
Computers...

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.433
...so unreliable.

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.943
Just Iike peopIe.

01:04:29.324 --> 01:04:31.284
You realIy thought l didn't know?

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:45.465
So, what are you injecting me with?

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:47.384
The antivirus.

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:52.097
The T-virus reanimates dead celIs.

01:04:52.264 --> 01:04:55.308
BasicalIy, bringing the dead to life.

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:59.646
Or in a living human,
it can cause uncontrollabIe mutation.

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:04.317
Or it can heIp her waIk again,
if the virus is kept in check with this.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.778
-Angie's infected?
-Yes.

01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:09.698
The ceIlular growth is enough
to regenerate her...

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:11.992
...but not enough to cause mutation.

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.619
And they infected you
with the T-virus as weIl?

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:16.871
Yeah.

01:05:17.038 --> 01:05:19.749
But don't worry.
l'm not contagious.

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.087
Here.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:28.717
Tape the story.
l'll see that it gets put to good use.

01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:32.596
My name is Alice.

01:05:33.013 --> 01:05:35.682
l worked for the
Umbrella Corporation...

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:40.687
...the largest and most powerful
commercial entity in the world.

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:46.192
l was head of security at a secret
high-tech faciIity calIed The Hive...

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:50.196
...a giant underground laboratory
developing experimentaI...

01:05:50.363 --> 01:05:52.198
...viraI weaponry.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.729
Let's go.

01:08:26.853 --> 01:08:28.395
You missed one.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.845
We have to hurry.

01:09:02.013 --> 01:09:05.058
-We're okay. We have time.
-No! We have to hurry.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:10.438
-Holy shit! We stealing his ride!
-Take off.

01:09:12.232 --> 01:09:14.734
-l said, take off!
-What's the rush?

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:19.488
We've been expecting you.

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:26.287
-Perimeter secure.
-All sectors locked down.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:36.756
-Angie!
-Daddy!

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:41.594
-l knew you wouIdn't leave me.
-No. Never.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:45.765
Discard primary weaponry.

01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:03.533
The two of you showed such promise,
but we had to see you in action.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.369
And most impressive you've been.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:08.288
You're Iike brother and sister.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:12.834
Heightened speed, strength,
agility, the same kiIler instincts.

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:15.253
ParalleI strands of research.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:19.507
And now....
Now we'lI discover which is superior.

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:24.137
Fight him.

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:26.806
No.

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:29.309
Fight him, or they die.

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:33.021
What makes you think l care?

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.362
Daddy! Daddy, no.

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:43.531
No.

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:46.743
He was a valuabIe asset
to the corporation.

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.913
l don't even care
about these people.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.176
Begin.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:44.587
He's mutating. I want him
in the Nemesis Program.

01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:47.840
Matt!

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:54.514
Cellular structure breaking down.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:57.517
T-virus is manifesting itself
in a genetic mutation.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:04.190
We're seeing similar
ceIlular regeneration.

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:09.195
l'm sorry.

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:12.073
Oh, Matt. l'm so sorry.

01:14:16.202 --> 01:14:18.371
Finish him.

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:20.873
l said, finish him.

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:23.626
No.

01:14:25.336 --> 01:14:26.546
No.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:31.175
Don't you understand
how important you are to me?

01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:33.553
That creature is one thing,
but you...

01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:37.265
...somehow you bonded
with the T-virus on a cellular leveI.

01:14:37.849 --> 01:14:42.061
You adapted it, changed it.
You became magnificent.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:44.605
-l became a freak.
-No.

01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:48.568
You're not mutation.
You're evoIution.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:52.822
With my heIp, just imagine
what you can achieve.

01:14:54.282 --> 01:14:56.325
What about him?

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:01.747
Evolution has its dead ends.

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:05.251
Now, finish this.
Put him out of his misery...

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.587
...and come with me.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.174
No.

01:15:13.801 --> 01:15:16.888
You're such
a disappointment to me.

01:15:17.054 --> 01:15:18.598
AIl that strength...

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:21.184
...but no wiIl to use it.

01:15:22.727 --> 01:15:24.312
What a waste.

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:36.782
Prepare for takeoff.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:42.121
Sanitation of Raccoon City
to commence on my mark.

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:53.132
KilI her.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.350
What are you doing?

01:16:19.033 --> 01:16:20.326
Get us airborne.

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:32.505
This is Cain. Priority overload.
lnitiate launch proceedings.

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:36.342
Detonation set
at T-minus 5 minutes.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:45.351
Angie, get down!

01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:55.403
Why haven't we taken off?

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:58.406
Because l usualIy drive a Cadillac.

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:20.428
Surrender, or we open fire.

01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:51.917
Drop it.

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:00.301
AIice!

01:18:06.766 --> 01:18:09.435
Drop your weapon and surrender.

01:18:47.473 --> 01:18:49.225
Let's get this thing in the air!

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.232
You have to get up.

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:04.782
Matt....

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:09.286
Come on, we have to go.
We have to go. Come on.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:15.042
Come on.

01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:26.345
Get up!

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:30.182
lf you expect me to beg, l will not.

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:34.603
Wait.

01:19:43.362 --> 01:19:45.698
KilIing me won't put things right.

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:47.700
No...

01:19:47.867 --> 01:19:49.702
...but it's a start.

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:03.192
Are you going to be all right?

01:21:37.685 --> 01:21:39.895
Hang on to something!

01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:58.372
We're going down!

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.871
U-Gamma 9 to base.
Confirmation.

01:22:39.038 --> 01:22:40.706
We've Iocated the crash site.

01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:56.430
Fetch the medicaI team.

01:22:57.514 --> 01:22:59.224
What about the others?

01:22:59.391 --> 01:23:01.894
No other bodies found, sir.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:17.993
We have unconfirmed reports
of disaster at Raccoon City.

01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:19.995
These shocking images just in.

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:23.290
A mysterious pIague
or viral outbreak has run rampant--

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:26.794
Implicating Umbrella Corporation
in deaths of innocent citizens.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:31.340
This tape, work of former Raccoon 7
anchorwoman Terri Morales.

01:23:31.507 --> 01:23:33.926
New evidence now
discredits earIier reports--

01:23:34.093 --> 01:23:37.596
-Nothing more than sick joke.
-Fake videotape totally discredited.

01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:39.348
Nothing more than a big hoax.

01:23:39.515 --> 01:23:41.392
Playing on the very real tragedy...

01:23:41.558 --> 01:23:43.936
...which overwhelmed
Raccoon City this week.

01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:47.272
The reactor at the nuclear
power station went critical.

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:52.069
The worst atomic disaster since the
Russian Chernobyl incident in 1986.

01:23:52.236 --> 01:23:55.614
The state governor personally
thanked the Umbrella Corporation...

01:23:55.781 --> 01:23:57.157
...for their swift action.

01:23:57.324 --> 01:24:01.036
The perpetrators of the hoax,
Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera...

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:04.123
...now being sought
for questioning by the police.

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:19.471
Alice.

01:24:21.974 --> 01:24:23.809
Alice.

01:24:28.939 --> 01:24:31.900
Alice, wake up.

01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:37.823
Can you hear me?

01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:42.286
Do you understand
what l'm saying?

01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:46.290
Good.

01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:51.545
Begin the purging process.

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:22.034
Her recovery's remarkable.

01:25:22.201 --> 01:25:24.703
And her powers,
both physical and mental...

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:27.873
...are developing
at a geometric rate.

01:25:40.719 --> 01:25:42.513
Where are you?

01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:45.265
You're safe.

01:25:45.432 --> 01:25:47.267
Come on.

01:25:49.686 --> 01:25:51.605
That's it.
