WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:29.461 --> 01:30.485
They're here.

01:44.176 --> 01:46.576
Adam, you said I could do it, remember?

01:46.779 --> 01:48.144
Be my guest, Orko.

01:50.215 --> 01:52.706
Pangas,
Prime Minister of Tahryn.

01:53.185 --> 01:56.712
King Randor sends you,
this token of his esteem.

02:01.026 --> 02:03.256
Uh, that's not what I wanted.

02:09.168 --> 02:12.137
Uh... no, no problem.
Got it here somewhere.

02:18.043 --> 02:20.477
Is this what you're looking for, Orko.

02:20.746 --> 02:22.338
Oh... yeah.

02:23.248 --> 02:24.909
Oh, here you go, Your Majesty.

02:26.318 --> 02:29.583
Thank you, my friends,
and welcome to Tahryn. I...

02:52.911 --> 02:54.503
By the power of...

03:11.296 --> 03:12.923
Are you alright, Teela?

03:13.131 --> 03:15.531
I am fine. just a little shaken up.

03:17.002 --> 03:20.062
What happened, Pangas.
-Yog almost awoke.

03:20.339 --> 03:24.332
Legend says, that this
horrible creature called Yog...

03:24.510 --> 03:26.808
lives in the caverns beneath Tahryn...

03:27.012 --> 03:28.673
and when he wakes...

03:28.881 --> 03:31.247
A Singer must let him back to sleep...

03:31.450 --> 03:34.146
or he will destroy
Tahryn and all of Eternia.

03:34.353 --> 03:37.288
How horrible!
To live with such a threat.

03:38.423 --> 03:41.586
As long as there's a singer, we're safe.

03:44.696 --> 03:48.257
You mean, your singing
seems to calm Yog down?

03:59.678 --> 04:02.579
Nice trick. What else can you do?

04:03.415 --> 04:07.579
Anything I choose. Even stone will obey me.

04:10.455 --> 04:15.984
Most interesting.
I may have a use for this, singer.

04:25.003 --> 04:28.803
I'd like to see the real Skeletor,
all wrapped up like that.

04:30.609 --> 04:34.602
Perhaps someday you will, but not today.

04:36.481 --> 04:38.381
It was her idea, Skeletor.

04:38.650 --> 04:41.847
Quiet! I have a job for you two.

04:48.794 --> 04:50.523
Where is Lizard Man?

04:50.696 --> 04:51.993
Touring the rock garden.

04:52.197 --> 04:54.665
He probably fell asleep in the sun.

05:01.506 --> 05:02.404
Who's there?

05:03.775 --> 05:05.003
Going somewhere?

05:05.410 --> 05:07.503
Yesss! Away from you.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.948
No, I think you'd better stay awhile.

05:14.853 --> 05:15.718
Nice try.

05:15.743 --> 05:17.837
Now see if you can get me down.

05:26.832 --> 05:28.424
Not this time, lady.

05:29.835 --> 05:30.961
I'll stop him.

05:31.370 --> 05:33.838
No, let's get who we came here for.

05:41.580 --> 05:44.913
For generations my family
has kept Yog asleep...

05:45.117 --> 05:46.243
with our songs.

05:46.451 --> 05:48.783
It is a marvelous talent.
-It certainly is.

05:51.289 --> 05:53.655
Tela, Trap Jaw and Evil-Lyn are...

05:53.892 --> 05:54.984
are taking the singer.

06:00.132 --> 06:04.364
Now uh, if you'll excuse us.
Oh and don't bother getting up.

06:06.705 --> 06:09.265
By the power of Grayskull.

06:15.614 --> 06:20.074
I have the power.

06:40.605 --> 06:43.472
That was easy.
-So far.

06:43.675 --> 06:45.540
Let's hope we don't run into...

06:48.814 --> 06:50.873
He-Man! Oh no.

06:51.316 --> 06:52.874
Let the Singer go!

07:14.339 --> 07:19.436
He-Man, with our Singer gone,
nothing can stop Yog should he awaken.

07:33.992 --> 07:35.619
I'll be safe here.

07:38.964 --> 07:40.756
Too bad you can't float like me, Lizzy.

07:44.037 --> 07:44.935
Hey.

07:56.248 --> 07:58.327
If Yog awakens fully,

07:58.352 --> 08:00.109
Tahryn will be destroyed.

08:00.852 --> 08:04.015
Teela, you and Man-At-Arms
try to find and rescue Celice.

08:04.456 --> 08:06.617
You can bet she's at Snake Mountain.

08:06.892 --> 08:08.723
Right. What about you, He-Man?

08:09.127 --> 08:13.061
Orko, Lizard Man and I,
are going to stop Yog.

08:13.665 --> 08:14.563
Right.

08:16.268 --> 08:17.428
Beware, He-Man.

08:17.602 --> 08:20.537
There are more dangers
than Yog in the caverns.

08:37.923 --> 08:39.501
Hurry,
we've gotta reach Snake Mountain

08:39.525 --> 08:41.178
before Skeletor
makes his next move.

08:41.525 --> 08:43.926
The fools!  I'm way ahead of them.

08:44.062 --> 08:45.654
Delay them, Beast.

08:45.831 --> 08:49.198
Use your telepathy to call one
of the creatures you control.

08:50.202 --> 08:54.536
Giant Crawler, arise.

08:54.806 --> 08:56.831
This should bug them a little.

09:08.620 --> 09:10.019
Father!  Look out!

09:12.224 --> 09:13.122
No, father!

09:15.026 --> 09:19.656
Take him to Ice Island in the
middle of the Lake of Fire.

09:27.906 --> 09:30.204
How can we find Yog in this maze?

09:30.442 --> 09:33.673
The caverns run under half of Eternia...

09:33.845 --> 09:35.938
they might even go as far as Grayskull.

09:36.481 --> 09:38.506
Battle Cat can sniff him out.

09:45.690 --> 09:47.055
He's hot on the trail.

09:49.394 --> 09:51.225
Yeah, only it's the wrong trail.

09:53.598 --> 09:54.758
Orks

09:55.934 --> 09:58.425
Unfriendly Orks, the worst kind.

10:06.444 --> 10:08.173
Welcome, Singer.

10:08.446 --> 10:11.111
You will sing for me, now.

10:11.136 --> 10:13.874
And your song will
hypnotize the Sorceress...

10:14.019 --> 10:16.146
and open Castle Grayskull.

10:16.521 --> 10:17.112
Never.

10:17.389 --> 10:19.687
I think you can be persuaded.

10:20.258 --> 10:23.159
Evil-Lyn, persuade her!

10:24.629 --> 10:26.927
With pleasure, Skeletor.

10:41.913 --> 10:45.041
The centipede, will be easy to track.
I'll save you, father...

10:45.784 --> 10:47.081
...wherever you are.

10:54.025 --> 10:55.686
This calls for some teamwork.

10:55.994 --> 10:57.325
-Right!

10:57.354 --> 10:58.821
This should brighten things up.

11:02.667 --> 11:03.827
Now, Lizzy!

11:04.569 --> 11:06.628
Come get me, cave crawlers!

11:11.676 --> 11:13.701
Okay, He-Man, your turn!

11:20.251 --> 11:21.775
Well done, team.

11:21.987 --> 11:24.182
Now, by the time they find their way out...

11:24.422 --> 11:26.014
we'll be long gone.

11:33.231 --> 11:35.324
-Run! - We can't leave you.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.498
I said, run!

11:42.407 --> 11:43.339
He-Man! Oh.

11:51.850 --> 11:54.648
As I was saying, let's go find Yog.

12:00.291 --> 12:02.885
Skeletor's will is your will, singer.

12:03.361 --> 12:05.420
You will do as he bids.

12:05.764 --> 12:08.699
No, I will not use my songs for evil.

12:10.135 --> 12:13.002
You have no choice, you are in my power!

12:13.471 --> 12:14.267
Follow me.

12:18.443 --> 12:20.413
I built this model from a stone

12:20.438 --> 12:22.801
stolen from Grayskull.

12:23.248 --> 12:24.647
Sing, Celice.

12:25.050 --> 12:28.110
I... must... sing.

12:41.399 --> 12:42.388
It works!

12:42.567 --> 12:44.296
Now, for the real thing.

12:50.976 --> 12:53.206
The Centipede's tracks stop here.

12:53.345 --> 12:55.108
So my father must be...

12:55.313 --> 12:56.143
there!

12:58.550 --> 13:00.347
But, how do I get there?

13:09.995 --> 13:11.587
I hope this works.

13:11.763 --> 13:14.061
Haven't got time for a hot bath.

13:16.201 --> 13:17.725
... and, away!

13:21.373 --> 13:22.135
Phew.

13:28.113 --> 13:31.276
Keep back, you overgrown garden pest!

13:37.222 --> 13:37.881
Teela!

13:38.290 --> 13:41.088
Father, hold on. I'll get you out.

13:42.027 --> 13:43.221
Any idea, how?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.195
This should put that big bug on ice.

14:11.656 --> 14:12.418
Father!

14:13.091 --> 14:15.286
You're safe!
-Yes, thanks to you.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.710
Now, to get off this island

14:17.735 --> 14:19.420
and then to find Celice.

14:24.836 --> 14:28.237
The Sorceress is in Grayskull, Celice.

14:28.373 --> 14:29.790
You will use your siren

14:29.815 --> 14:31.230
song to hypnotise her

14:31.409 --> 14:33.673
and then sing the Jawbridge down.

14:34.812 --> 14:35.369
Go!

14:37.081 --> 14:39.641
You... are... evil... but...

14:40.552 --> 14:45.216
I... cannot... resist you.

14:49.761 --> 14:52.194
Forgive me, Sorceress...

14:52.219 --> 14:54.347
wherever you are...

15:20.391 --> 15:21.119
Listen.

15:22.660 --> 15:23.490
Celice

15:24.395 --> 15:25.362
C'mon.

15:32.470 --> 15:35.337
We're under Tahryn.
This has to be Yog's lair.

15:36.073 --> 15:38.366
O-okay, b-but he's gone.

15:38.391 --> 15:40.591
That means he's awake.

15:41.546 --> 15:44.071
Listen. Celice.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.649
You're right, Orko. He's awake,

15:46.674 --> 15:48.574
and he's followed her song.

15:48.753 --> 15:49.515
Let's go!

15:50.488 --> 15:52.888
He-Man.
-Sorceress?

15:53.191 --> 15:54.954
Come to Grayskull.

15:55.460 --> 15:56.392
Hurry.

15:56.995 --> 15:58.826
To Grayskull, c'mon.

16:02.233 --> 16:04.565
Her song has lulled the Sorceress to sleep.

16:05.303 --> 16:07.328
You have done your job well, singer.

16:07.639 --> 16:09.903
Now open the Jawbridge.

16:13.711 --> 16:14.473
No!

16:15.313 --> 16:17.304
She's broken my hypnotic spell.

16:17.582 --> 16:21.416
No one defies me and gets away with it.

16:24.856 --> 16:25.515
C'mon.

16:27.925 --> 16:30.155
Open Grayskull for me!

16:31.696 --> 16:33.163
You cannot can't stop me!

16:33.598 --> 16:35.122
Grayskull will be mine!

16:49.947 --> 16:51.915
Oh no you don't, rug-face.

16:53.718 --> 16:55.777
Get out while you can, Beast Man.

17:01.592 --> 17:04.117
Lizzy, let me give you a hand.

17:07.898 --> 17:08.866
Sorceress.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.833
Wake up, Sorceress.  Wake up.

17:21.244 --> 17:23.076
Leaving so soon?

17:23.414 --> 17:26.315
Let go of me, flesh-face, or I'll...

17:33.529 --> 17:34.529
Yog!

17:34.926 --> 17:35.722
Celice!

17:55.680 --> 17:58.171
Skeletor isn't fighting fair!

17:59.951 --> 18:01.816
This should even things a bit.

18:09.127 --> 18:11.322
A zero-G bubble.

18:11.829 --> 18:15.265
I always said you were a
lightweight, Skeletor!

18:16.267 --> 18:18.929
Sleep again, Yog.

18:19.170 --> 18:21.297
She sang Yog back to sleep...

18:21.539 --> 18:23.063
but not for long.

18:28.513 --> 18:29.207
Grayskull!

18:30.281 --> 18:32.078
Yog's out of control.

18:42.493 --> 18:44.358
The old squeeze play, eh?

19:13.191 --> 19:15.284
Are you alright, Celice? -Yes.

19:15.893 --> 19:19.226
He-Man! The Sorceress
is under a sleep spell.

19:19.464 --> 19:20.726
I can't wake her up.

19:21.032 --> 19:23.466
I will wake her.

19:40.351 --> 19:41.841
What happened, Lizard Man?

19:42.153 --> 19:44.831
Oh, things all right
now, Sorceress.

19:44.856 --> 19:47.171
Thanks to the singer of Tahryn.

19:47.992 --> 19:48.651
Look!

19:55.299 --> 19:57.699
Well, looks like things are back to normal.

19:57.902 --> 20:00.097
We'll return you to Tahryn, Celice.

20:00.505 --> 20:01.732
To what purpose?

20:01.757 --> 20:04.932
You have hurled Yog into a bottomless pit.

20:05.142 --> 20:07.007
I am no longer needed.

20:07.278 --> 20:08.623
Courage and strength like yours

20:08.648 --> 20:09.862
are always needed Celice.

20:10.181 --> 20:10.923
Teela's right.

20:10.948 --> 20:13.174
There's still plenty of evil on Eternia.

20:13.417 --> 20:15.317
We could use your help against it.

20:15.553 --> 20:18.262
I am a singer.
I've always been alone,

20:18.287 --> 20:21.345
but now, I have friends...

20:22.059 --> 20:24.186
I will do, what I can.

20:31.903 --> 20:34.167
In today's story,
the beautiful voice of Celice

20:34.339 --> 20:35.802
kept the evil Yog from making

20:35.827 --> 20:37.491
all sorts of bad things happen.

20:38.109 --> 20:39.777
Now, I can't promise that a song

20:39.802 --> 20:41.364
will make any magic for you,

20:41.513 --> 20:42.953
but I can promise that when

20:42.978 --> 20:44.631
you're feeling lonely or sad,

20:44.749 --> 20:46.580
and we all do sometimes,

20:46.751 --> 20:48.112
if you try singing a song,

20:48.137 --> 20:50.438
or maybe whistling, or maybe just smiling,

20:50.688 --> 20:52.747
you'll feel a lot better. Honest!

20:52.924 --> 20:53.913
Try it and see.

20:53.992 --> 20:55.823
And I'll be seeing you, very soon.

20:55.994 --> 20:56.892
Bye now!
