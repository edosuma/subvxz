WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:03.171
-9-1-1. What's your emergency?
-(siren wailing)

00:03.204 --> 00:05.206
Let's get him out of here
before this thing blows!

00:05.239 --> 00:07.041
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:07.075 --> 00:08.842
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.876 --> 00:12.012
Empire, The Resident,
and The Gifted.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.582
We are going to show you
the dawn of a new age.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.618 --> 00:21.389
Okay, you've officially reached
Fort Knox-level security.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.224
Oh, you think it's too much?

00:23.257 --> 00:25.259
Three motion sensors
in the living room?

00:25.293 --> 00:27.528
I mean, maybe if you're
trying to keep Tom Cruise

00:27.561 --> 00:30.198
from getting his hands
on your NOC list.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.732
Mission: Impossible. No?

00:31.765 --> 00:33.167
Sorry, haven't seen it.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.968
Travesty.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.406
EDDIE:
Maybe we pop the hinges

00:38.439 --> 00:40.874
-off the door.
-Or we use the Jaws of Life.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.611
No, no, no. It has to fit.
I measured it twice.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.447
Can't you guys just, you know,
turn it around the other way?

00:46.480 --> 00:48.782
And then the pizza
will slide off.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.251
You have pizza on my new sofa?

00:50.284 --> 00:52.220
It's on the plastic.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.923
Okay.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.092
I'm sorry. You were showing me
the security app.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.693
EDDIE:
All right, pivot. (grunts)

00:59.727 --> 01:03.197
Okay, so, basically, you can
check everything on here.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.865
(grunting)

01:04.898 --> 01:06.100
Lift with your legs.

01:06.134 --> 01:07.901
And you can also
check it on your phone

01:07.935 --> 01:09.203
if you're not at home.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.938
That's great 'cause now
if I hear a noise

01:10.971 --> 01:12.173
in the middle of the night,

01:12.206 --> 01:14.908
I don't have to get out of bed
to know it's the ice maker.

01:14.942 --> 01:18.746
Hey, thank you, guys,
for helping me on your day off.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.914
-Don't worry about it. Plates?
-Countertop.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.417
-Kitchen.
-CHIMNEY: Beer?

01:23.451 --> 01:25.819
Uh, also kitchen, fridge.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.421
CHIMNEY:
Clever.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.826
He is so cute.

01:32.860 --> 01:36.230
Yeah, he gets that a lot. Uh,
you should meet his kid, though.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.232
Wait, Chimney has a kid?

01:38.266 --> 01:41.001
No, I-I thought you meant...

01:43.103 --> 01:45.005
Chimney?

01:52.946 --> 01:56.016
(dog barking)

02:06.227 --> 02:07.361
(clattering nearby)

02:07.395 --> 02:09.630
(gasps)

02:16.337 --> 02:19.039
(wind chimes jingling)

02:19.072 --> 02:22.576
(gasps, panting)

02:47.034 --> 02:48.636
(sighs)

02:48.669 --> 02:49.637
(door closes)

02:49.670 --> 02:52.172
(alarm clock beeping)

02:52.206 --> 02:56.344
(grunts softly)
Oh...

02:56.377 --> 02:58.512
*

03:09.022 --> 03:10.891
(sirens wailing)

03:17.197 --> 03:20.601
Hey, stay down! Stay down!

03:20.634 --> 03:22.570
-MAN: Get out of here.
-WOMAN: Keep 'em back.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.006
The pilot radioed

03:26.039 --> 03:27.941
they were having
mechanical trouble.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.743
Looks like he tried
to put it down

03:29.777 --> 03:31.679
-in the field over there.
-Yeah, it got close.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.548
Yeah, not close enough.
Get down, people, move!

03:34.582 --> 03:36.584
Move! Go!

03:36.617 --> 03:38.185
All right, guys,
we're gonna fan out,

03:38.218 --> 03:39.019
go behind those bleachers.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.554
Eddie, after we get
the people out,

03:40.588 --> 03:41.922
you think you can
kill that engine?

03:41.955 --> 03:44.191
Think so, I'm just worried
about the dynamic rollover.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.259
The dynamic what?

03:45.293 --> 03:47.861
We change the weight ratio
by pulling people out,

03:47.895 --> 03:50.531
whole thing could tip over,
rotors could snap off.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.600
And then flying rocks are gonna
be the least of our problems.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.569
All right, visors down.
Let's go!

04:03.577 --> 04:05.746
-Buck, get her out of there.
-On it, Cap.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.117
Put your arms around me.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.119
-Yes. All right, here we go.
-Okay.

04:13.321 --> 04:16.156
-Ah!
-(shouting)

04:16.189 --> 04:18.091
Got to keep it moving.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.765
All right.

04:24.798 --> 04:28.268
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.119
Pulse/ox is good.
We can get rid of this.

04:46.153 --> 04:50.123
-How are you doing?
-I'm not sure.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.592
How's Trent? Is he okay?

04:51.625 --> 04:54.428
Your pilot's gonna be just fine.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.765
Hey, do me a favor.
Uh, say, "And on the 405,

04:57.798 --> 04:59.700
"speeds are under
five miles an hour,

04:59.733 --> 05:01.469
making your morning commute
a rough one."

05:01.502 --> 05:03.136
Seriously?

05:03.170 --> 05:04.938
I-I-I know that voice.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.540
It's, uh, it's Taylor Kelly
reporting, right?

05:06.574 --> 05:07.941
Right. Skywitness News Eight.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.477
That's me.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.011
BUCK:
Wow. Um, it's, uh,

05:11.044 --> 05:15.983
it's weird to hear that voice
come out of a face.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.118
Thank you?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.988
Um, you have helped me beat
traffic in this city

05:21.021 --> 05:22.790
more times than you
will ever know.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.627
Oh, you might want
to Uber tomorrow.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.497
(chuckles)

05:29.530 --> 05:31.565
Uh...

05:31.599 --> 05:35.302
PRIEST: For justice and peace
in the world,

05:35.335 --> 05:38.639
and that our leaders may be
illuminated by the grace of God.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.873
We pray to the Lord.

05:39.907 --> 05:43.343
CONGREGATION:
Lord, hear our prayer.

05:43.377 --> 05:46.313
PRIEST: And for the repose
of the soul of Brook Nash.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.816
We pray to the Lord.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.852
CONGREGATION:
Lord, hear our prayer.

05:54.354 --> 05:58.826
BOBBY:
She would've turned 13 today.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.028
PRIEST: Is it hard to reconcile
that with the image

06:01.061 --> 06:03.531
you still have of her
in your mind?

06:03.564 --> 06:04.832
BOBBY:
Yeah.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.636
Especially around her birthday.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.742
Brook's very last school project

06:14.775 --> 06:17.511
was a show-and-tell
with her dad,

06:17.545 --> 06:19.212
the "hero."

06:21.915 --> 06:25.118
She was so proud of me.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.990
I believe
she's proud of you now.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.294
I hope so, Father.
I really hope so.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.600
(sighs)

06:39.633 --> 06:41.702
TAYLOR:
This is fantastic.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.705
I love it.
We need to capture it all.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.007
Real life inside a firehouse.

06:48.742 --> 06:53.280
Please, God, tell me there's a
Dalmatian around here somewhere.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.249
-Excuse me.
-Captain Nash, I'm Taylor Kelly.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.752
-We met the other day when...
-I know who you are, Ms. Kelly.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.287
I just don't understand
what you're doing here.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.390
-Please don't film in here.
-Uh, why not?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.493
Because it's-it's rude.

07:05.526 --> 07:08.261
Oh, they didn't call you yet.

07:08.295 --> 07:09.563
-Who?
-FIREFIGHTER: Captain,

07:09.597 --> 07:11.665
Chief's office on the line.

07:13.501 --> 07:16.236
Uh, Taylor Kelly?

07:16.269 --> 07:19.406
(chuckles)
Wh-What are you doing here?

07:19.439 --> 07:23.176
You can just call me Taylor.
Uh, how was your drive in?

07:23.210 --> 07:24.277
Did you miss me?

07:24.311 --> 07:26.747
My morning definitely
wasn't the same without you.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.583
-(chuckles) I...
-Hey, how're you feeling?

07:29.617 --> 07:31.585
Any side effects
after the crash?

07:31.619 --> 07:32.820
I'm great.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.255
Thanks to all of you,

07:35.288 --> 07:37.758
which is why I'm here.
You guys were so amazing.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.693
I want to do a story
on this firehouse

07:39.727 --> 07:42.863
and on the heroes who work here.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.932
Yeah, but you do traffic.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.767
I'm not quite ready
to go back in the sky,

07:46.800 --> 07:50.303
so I thought I'd try my hand at
telling a story from the ground.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.439
And use your newfound fame
to put your face

07:52.472 --> 07:53.607
in front of the camera.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.475
-That, too.
-Smart girl.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.210
I can't wait to interview
all of you.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.112
I want to know why
you chose this job,

07:59.146 --> 08:00.948
the crazy things you've seen,

08:00.981 --> 08:02.182
what it's like to face death.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.117
I mean, Howie,
you almost died, right?

08:04.151 --> 08:07.120
Actually, nobody calls me that.
It's Chimney.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.522
-I bet there's a story there.
-Hmm.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.824
-Not one you can tell on TV.
-(Taylor chuckles)

08:10.858 --> 08:12.325
Well, you must've really
impressed the chief.

08:12.359 --> 08:14.461
He said to give you
whatever access you need.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.796
Don't worry, Captain Nash,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.965
your story's in good hands.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.000
I'm gonna make you all famous.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.009
TAYLOR:
Tell us about all this.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.679
Oh. This table
is all about the love.

08:31.712 --> 08:35.148
It's, uh, tokens of appreciation
from the people we serve.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.051
Baked goods are big,
and cards, we love the cards.

08:38.085 --> 08:41.488
Mmm, and carbs. We love carbs.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.658
But this stuff is what
really keeps us going,

08:44.692 --> 08:47.928
-the love.
-Mmm, and the carbs.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.429
And the carbs.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.067
What made me want to become
a firefighter?

08:54.101 --> 08:56.236
That's a great question.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.840
Short answer:

08:59.873 --> 09:01.709
I got shot.

09:01.742 --> 09:05.245
Well, to be honest, I, um,
I just kind of fell into it.

09:05.278 --> 09:08.115
EDDIE: What I missed most
after leaving the Army

09:08.148 --> 09:10.017
is the camaraderie, um,

09:10.050 --> 09:12.419
working shoulder-to-shoulder
with a great team,

09:12.452 --> 09:15.255
and there's none better
than the one I found here.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.791
I mean, what little kid doesn't
want to be a firefighter?

09:17.825 --> 09:22.529
Especially... a hot firefighter.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.197
That's for you. Go ahead.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.634
HEN: The bullet wasn't
meant for me, um...

09:26.667 --> 09:29.536
I was 16 years old,
walking home from school,

09:29.569 --> 09:32.139
and I hear this "pop, pop, pop."

09:32.172 --> 09:35.909
And next thing,
I feel this penetrating pain

09:35.943 --> 09:38.378
just throw me to the ground.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.314
The stray bullet
had entered my back,

09:41.348 --> 09:45.719
ruptured a kidney,
and, uh, grazed my aorta.

09:45.753 --> 09:49.589
I was dying.

09:49.623 --> 09:54.061
And then someone yelled,
"Call 911."

09:54.094 --> 09:56.997
And I guess someone did
because the next thing you know,

09:57.030 --> 09:58.565
I was in the back
of an ambulance,

09:58.598 --> 10:01.234
and these two paramedics
were working on me

10:01.268 --> 10:04.938
and just telling me
to stay with them.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.910
You know, their skill
kept me from dying,

10:09.943 --> 10:14.281
but the way they cared for me...

10:14.314 --> 10:17.617
that's what kept me alive.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.623
TAYLOR: Yeah, let's go see
if we can grab him. Come on.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.426
Captain Nash.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.262
Can we have a few minutes
with you?

10:29.296 --> 10:31.264
-Um...
-(alarm ringing)

10:31.298 --> 10:33.100
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, Station 118.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.536
Engine and rescue.
Got a report of adult male,

10:36.569 --> 10:38.471
difficulty breathing.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.060
(sirens wailing)

11:04.397 --> 11:07.534
I was told there's a man here
who's choking to death.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.970
No, uh, Gregory says
he doesn't want any help now.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.205
Okay, excuse me, ma'am.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.473
Wonder how many he put down.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.143
Joey Chestnut scarfed down
74 hot dogs in ten minutes

11:16.176 --> 11:18.145
at last year's
Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.048
Excuse me, sir,
are you refusing care?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.084
-(hissing)
-Ah, geez!

11:24.117 --> 11:25.886
-EDDIE: Whoa.
-Cute.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.487
That thing yours?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.689
That's Claude.
He's the grand prize.

11:29.723 --> 11:30.858
-(groaning)
-BOBBY: Whoa, guys, guys.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.559
Get them in. Give us some room.

11:32.592 --> 11:33.827
Get this table and chairs
out of here.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.563
That means you guys, too.
Give us some room. Back up.

11:36.596 --> 11:37.430
Prep the defib.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.399
HEN:
Airways are sealing up.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.268
I need the BBM.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.004
What was this, like,
a pepper eating contest?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.239
No. Protein.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.507
His pulse is thready.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.709
-(chirping)
-CHIMNEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.244
-Locusts!
-Oh, whoa.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.246
SANDY:
No, they're actually crickets.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.048
We allowed anything
that Claude would eat.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.583
We thought it might be fun.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.418
His pulse is weakening.
He's in V-fib.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.620
-He's coding.
-CHIMNEY: Starting compressions.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.725
Damn it, the blockage
is too big.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.394
He's not getting any air.
Let me try something.

12:07.427 --> 12:08.762
-Come on, buddy.
-Buck, give me the Magill.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.430
CHIMNEY:
Come on.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.466
Come on, come on.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.470
-Oh, my God.
-Right here, man.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.539
Ugh.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.974
I got it.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.815
(gasps)

12:27.848 --> 12:29.249
(exhales loudly)

12:29.282 --> 12:31.384
-He's back.
-CHIMNEY: I got sinus rhythm,

12:31.418 --> 12:33.420
pulse action's rising.
Let's get him up.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.623
(retching)

12:36.656 --> 12:38.491
Try to breathe.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.294
All this for a lizard, huh?

12:41.328 --> 12:44.497
A monitor lizard, and 500 bucks.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.333
And I just lost.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.902
(mouth full):
Yes, you did! Yeah!

12:48.936 --> 12:50.770
-(cheering)
-Almost.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.909
MAN:
Oh, roaches, dude.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.811
Oh! Eat the roaches.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.814
-Yes, eat it.
-(retches)

13:00.848 --> 13:02.282
MAN:
Yes!

13:02.315 --> 13:03.817
Claude, I guess
you're staying with me.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.152
(hissing)

13:05.185 --> 13:06.786
-(gasps)
-(laughs): Oh.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.857
I guess he likes you.
He likes redheads.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.792
-Ah.
-(laughs): Come on.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.329
I just don't like her.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.465
You don't like the intrusion?

13:18.498 --> 13:21.168
I don't. I don't like cameras
in the firehouse.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.270
I certainly don't like them
on calls.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.838
Makes it harder for us
to do our job.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.875
Well, unfortunately,
that's the reality nowadays.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.042
Cameras everywhere.

13:29.076 --> 13:32.045
Body cams, phone cameras, CCTVs.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.614
Big Brother
is definitely watching.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.683
No, I'm more worried
about Little Sister.

13:36.716 --> 13:37.951
Are you gonna be on TV?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.619
Not if I can help it.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.688
-Doesn't May like short ribs?
-(laughs)

13:41.721 --> 13:43.356
Well, it might
have something to do

13:43.390 --> 13:45.458
with that story you told
at mealtime.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.726
Oh.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.396
-No, she's on a stupid diet.
-Wha-- still?

13:49.429 --> 13:51.965
I told her she did not need
to do that.

13:51.999 --> 13:53.300
Why is May on a diet?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.135
Oh... homecoming.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.837
Her first.
Dress search was epic.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.375
Okay. Tell me what you think.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.476
(gasps)

14:03.510 --> 14:05.012
Daddy didn't like the first one.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.479
-Said it was too low-cut.
-HARRY: Yeah, it was.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.882
I could almost
see your belly button.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.051
No, you could not.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.320
It's perfect, May.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.188
-(giggles)
-Just like you. (laughs)

14:15.222 --> 14:17.324
Right, Bobby?

14:17.357 --> 14:21.194
Yeah. You look beautiful.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.596
MAY:
Then I guess we have a winner.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.498
BOBBY: Hey, guys,
I'm sorry to cut this short,

14:25.532 --> 14:27.067
but I have, uh, an early shift,

14:27.100 --> 14:28.868
so I better get home
and get a good night's sleep.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.271
But I want to see all the
pictures from your big night.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.106
-Good night, Bobby.
-Good night.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.407
Um...

14:34.441 --> 14:37.144
I-I'll walk you out.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.748
Oh, Bobby, Bobby, wait.

14:41.781 --> 14:44.751
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:44.784 --> 14:47.420
I'm sorry. I just...

14:47.454 --> 14:50.090
I didn't think about how hard
that would be for you.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.524
No, don't-don't do that. Please.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.962
Please, don't feel bad
about this.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.363
You have two wonderful children

14:56.396 --> 14:58.131
with a lifetime
of milestones ahead of them,

14:58.165 --> 15:00.867
and I want you to be able to
enjoy each and every one of them

15:00.900 --> 15:02.202
without worrying about me.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.871
Well, don't tell me
I can't do both.

15:04.904 --> 15:08.575
I mean, multitasking is one
of my many talents.

15:08.608 --> 15:11.811
-(both laugh)
-Come here.

15:15.848 --> 15:19.386
Are you sure you don't want
to come back inside?

15:19.419 --> 15:22.322
Yeah, I should get some rest.

15:22.355 --> 15:26.126
Tomorrow morning will be here
before we know it.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.128
All right, good night.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.297
Night.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.644
("You've Got Another Thing
Comin'" by Judas Priest playing)

15:48.448 --> 15:50.217
(crowd cheering)

16:05.132 --> 16:07.534
ANNOUNCER:
All right, Muscle Beach.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.103
Time for the posedown.
Who's your winner?

16:10.137 --> 16:11.504
Look at those tapered waists,

16:11.538 --> 16:15.142
wide shoulders
and explosive quads.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.844
Too much for a man?
You decide.

16:19.746 --> 16:20.847
Double bicep.

16:22.882 --> 16:23.916
Yeah!

16:27.420 --> 16:29.122
ANNOUNCER:
Side chest.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.124
* And kind of proud

16:31.158 --> 16:33.526
(straining)

16:33.560 --> 16:36.129
* I'm on the top but as long
as the music's loud *

16:36.163 --> 16:38.865
Back and bicep.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.667
*

16:40.700 --> 16:44.037
* If you think I'll sit around
as the world goes by *

16:44.071 --> 16:45.538
* You're thinking like a fool

16:45.572 --> 16:47.307
* 'Cause it's a case
of do or die *

16:47.340 --> 16:48.808
* If you think
I'll let it go... *

16:48.841 --> 16:50.943
(screams)

17:03.022 --> 17:05.692
(siren wailing, horn honking)

17:13.866 --> 17:17.036
BOBBY:
LAFD. Clear a path.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.043
-What the hell?
-Keep filming.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.716
Looks like extreme hyponatremia.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.884
-BRET: Say what?
-He's got a charley horse.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.953
-Hea charley horse.
-What's your name?

17:33.986 --> 17:36.856
-Charlie.
-Okay, Charlie,
when was the last time

17:36.889 --> 17:38.858
-you had any fluids?
-Yesterday afternoon.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.027
Flushed yourself out
for the competition today?

17:41.060 --> 17:43.396
And for the weigh-ins,
to make the veins pop.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.098
Well, you are
definitely popping.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.899
All right, Charlie, your
potassium and your sodium

17:46.933 --> 17:48.635
have bottomed out and that's why
you're seizing up.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.970
Now, before we start
replenishing your electrolytes,

17:51.003 --> 17:53.973
you got to answer me honestly:
are you dosing?

17:54.006 --> 17:56.576
N-No steroids, if that's what
you mean. I'm totally clean.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.747
Okay, you two need to back off.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.315
Get that camera
out of here, please.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.883
Cap needs room to work.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.318
-I'm working, too.
-You can work further back.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.154
Charlie, I just need you to know

18:07.187 --> 18:08.755
that if you're not being
straight with me, and we start

18:08.788 --> 18:10.457
giving you saline
and you have been dosing,

18:10.490 --> 18:11.824
your kidneys could start
to fail, okay?

18:11.858 --> 18:14.127
-And that'd be on you.
-I'm on steroids.

18:14.161 --> 18:15.628
Okay, that's better.
Are you taking anything else?

18:15.662 --> 18:18.231
I took a diuretic last night
to shed some water weight.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.767
That explains his low
blood pressure. 70/40.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.403
All right,
let's get him transported.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.138
On three, everybody.
Ready? One, two, three.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.140
(shouting)

18:27.174 --> 18:30.076
-Am I, am I gonna be okay?
-We're gonna get you
through the day.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.411
You'd think he'd earn
a trophy for holding

18:31.444 --> 18:33.246
-that pose so long.
-Right?

18:33.280 --> 18:35.582
Captain, we'd love
to get some words from you.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.417
Okay, here's a few:

18:37.450 --> 18:39.952
stop pointing that camera
at people who are in distress.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.289
The people we serve have to feel
like they can trust us

18:42.322 --> 18:45.692
and can be honest with us;
otherwise, mistakes get made.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.863
We're totally using that.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.801
(Buck laughs)

18:57.304 --> 18:58.705
(mouths)

18:58.738 --> 19:01.073
All right...
(chuckles)

19:05.178 --> 19:08.147
Is he always so prickly?

19:08.181 --> 19:11.951
Who, Cap? Uh, nah. He, uh...

19:11.984 --> 19:15.488
he barks a little,
but ring that bell,

19:15.522 --> 19:17.290
he's, he's one of the guys.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.025
I don't think he likes me much.

19:19.058 --> 19:22.161
It's funny,
'cause you're so likable.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.364
(laughs)
Well, I am trying.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.199
Look, Cap is not prickly, okay?

19:26.233 --> 19:28.535
He just, he just doesn't know
you yet, that's all.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.804
We-we get two,
three calls, right?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.806
He's putting out fires all day.

19:33.840 --> 19:38.711
The rest of us, we just have
to be one thing at a time.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.313
The guy in his job,

19:40.347 --> 19:44.884
he has to be everything.

19:44.917 --> 19:49.689
The truth is,
he inspires me every single day.

19:49.722 --> 19:53.226
And I am trying to put
a giant spotlight on him.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.263
On all of you unsung heroes.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.597
Tell your story.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.767
To him, we're not the story.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.204
We're just here to make sure
no story ends before it should.

20:10.743 --> 20:14.213
911. What is your emergency?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.852
This is 911. Is anyone there?

20:19.886 --> 20:23.456
WOMAN (over phone):
I-I'm sorry. I...

20:23.490 --> 20:25.458
Ma'am, are you having
an emergency?

20:25.492 --> 20:27.794
Do you need me
to send some help?

20:31.998 --> 20:35.635
(panting)

20:36.736 --> 20:38.838
Tell me where you are.

20:44.110 --> 20:47.414
If you're afraid
of someone hearing,

20:47.447 --> 20:50.249
if you're not alone,

20:50.283 --> 20:53.586
pretend you're talking
to someone else.

20:55.355 --> 20:58.257
A friend, a-a telemarketer.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.895
Act like you're ordering
a pizza--

21:02.929 --> 21:06.466
just give me your location,
and I will send help.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.735
WOMAN:
I'm sorry. Wrong number.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.136
(dial tone)

21:10.169 --> 21:12.271
(panting)

21:27.320 --> 21:29.288
(gasps)

21:29.322 --> 21:32.625
Sue, hi. Good morning.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.961
Are you okay?

21:34.994 --> 21:37.497
Yeah, I'm-I'm just tired.
I haven't...

21:37.530 --> 21:39.666
been sleeping very well.

21:43.370 --> 21:47.206
You've been a great addition
to the team, Maddie.

21:47.239 --> 21:50.109
I'm impressed with
how you've taken to the job.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.780
Sometimes, I forget you haven't
been doing it for very long.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.115
I'm sorry.
Did I do something wrong?

21:56.148 --> 21:58.451
Not at all. No.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.687
But I am concerned.

22:00.720 --> 22:05.958
You're tired, skittish.
(laughs)

22:05.992 --> 22:09.295
I know the job can be stressful,
and I just want to make sure

22:09.328 --> 22:11.631
that you know we have
resources available

22:11.664 --> 22:15.968
if you're having trouble
managing the stress.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.137
There's no shame
in asking for help.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.306
It's not the job.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.910
I mean, right this very second
it is the job, but it's...

22:23.943 --> 22:29.081
really that the job
is reminding me of my life.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.883
My marriage.

22:30.917 --> 22:35.221
Call hit a little close to home?

22:35.254 --> 22:38.157
She wouldn't...

22:38.190 --> 22:42.194
couldn't speak, and I could
hear her crying, and...

22:44.030 --> 22:49.201
I knew what was wrong, but she
wouldn't let me help her.

22:49.235 --> 22:52.605
Maybe I should've told her
that it was all gonna be okay.

22:52.639 --> 22:55.842
You know,
that she could just leave

22:55.875 --> 23:00.179
and not live her life in fear.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.782
But it's not true.

23:04.651 --> 23:10.757
I-I ran 2,600 miles away, and it
doesn't even feel far enough.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.192
(sniffles)

23:13.225 --> 23:15.728
I mean, my apartment
is a fortress.

23:15.762 --> 23:19.098
I sleep with a baseball bat
by my bed,

23:19.131 --> 23:21.267
and I still don't feel safe.

23:21.300 --> 23:24.604
It's like I never got up
off that floor.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.473
But you did.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.975
You got up and you got out.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.143
A-And I'm sure
that there had been moments

23:31.177 --> 23:35.548
when the idea of that
felt impossible.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.950
Yet, here you are.

23:37.984 --> 23:43.422
Just trust yourself
and keep moving forward.

23:43.456 --> 23:46.593
It's gotten you here so far.

23:46.626 --> 23:49.095
It'll get you
the rest of the way.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.267
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

23:55.301 --> 23:57.069
New arrival.

23:57.103 --> 24:01.007
When they send it in plastic,
you know it's gonna be good.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.509
Aw.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.243
Serious, you guys? You couldn't
even leave me any crumbs?

24:04.276 --> 24:06.913
-Ooh, Chim, you missed out.
-Is that chocolate?

24:06.946 --> 24:10.249
-Mmm. Fudge, with nuts.
-I love fudge with nuts.

24:10.282 --> 24:14.453
Oh, damn, you would've loved
these because... scrumptious.

24:16.489 --> 24:17.990
I'm sorry you had to see this,

24:18.024 --> 24:21.761
this dark underbelly
of hour 21 in a 24-hour shift.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.697
Gets pretty mercenary
around here.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.899
(alarm ringing)

24:28.735 --> 24:30.770
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, Station 118.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.505
Medical aid. Unknown injury.

24:32.539 --> 24:33.806
PD's responding.

24:38.477 --> 24:39.946
Where's Captain Nash?

24:39.979 --> 24:41.714
He's sitting this one out,
wrapping the shift.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.850
It's a simple med call.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.619
(siren wailing)

24:46.653 --> 24:48.721
(horn honking)

24:55.995 --> 24:57.964
He doesn't want to talk to you.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.131
He'll talk to me.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.867
I am done going up
in that chopper

25:00.900 --> 25:02.468
and reporting on gridlock.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.403
Come on.

25:04.436 --> 25:08.307
Captain Nash, I know you don't
think very highly of me.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.209
I also know that
you've been avoiding me.

25:10.242 --> 25:13.012
But I want you to know
I only have one goal here:

25:13.045 --> 25:16.515
to tell a story, a true story,
about your station.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.985
You can have a true story.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.988
There's truth around us
all the time.

25:22.021 --> 25:25.324
There's truth right here
on this napkin.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.492
I'm sorry?

25:26.525 --> 25:29.996
Every crumb
is a universe onto itself.

25:30.029 --> 25:33.666
The more you zoom in,
the more you'll see.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.234
Is he high?

25:37.804 --> 25:41.040
(laughter)

25:41.073 --> 25:43.175
I think they're all high.

25:43.209 --> 25:48.748
These are specs of chocolate and
entire worlds at the same time.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.717
Holy crap.
I think it's the brownies.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.351
They've been dosed.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.787
-Wait, you didn't have one,
did you?
-(chuckles)

25:54.821 --> 25:58.390
Do I look like I eat fudge?

25:58.424 --> 25:59.892
Keep rolling.

26:06.298 --> 26:09.535
(siren wailing, horn honking)

26:09.568 --> 26:13.572
Man. Allergies are
going crazy today.

26:13.606 --> 26:17.043
You, too, huh? The index
wasn't elevated this morning.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.045
Think it's a new kind?

26:19.078 --> 26:21.881
-New kind of what?
-Of pollen.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.650
A new kind of pollen?

26:23.683 --> 26:25.985
You're not feeling this, Chim?

26:26.018 --> 26:28.721
No, I do not.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.456
I can see the pollen.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.825
I can hear it.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.596
This is ridiculous.
She's the one who cheated.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.131
She and her demon seed.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.233
That little girl is 11
if she's a day.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.669
-I want to see
the birth certificate.
-Ma'am, calm down,

26:42.702 --> 26:45.404
or I'll charge you
with resisting arrest, too.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.640
For what? This was self-defense.
My ex-husband's a lawyer.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.776
Oh, good. 'Cause I'm-a need you
to contact him

26:49.809 --> 26:51.277
to come and pick up
your daughter.

26:52.712 --> 26:55.281
Victim's over there.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.316
NATALIE (muffled):
Tell him it's an emergency.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.486
Who goes to Aruba
this time of year?

27:00.519 --> 27:01.420
Excuse me, ma'am?

27:01.453 --> 27:04.423
I'm trying to reach
my plastic surgeon.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.292
Okay, uh, uh,
first things first.

27:06.325 --> 27:08.260
Um, your adrenaline's probably
spiked, which is why

27:08.294 --> 27:11.263
you haven't passed out yet,
so I'm gonna ask you, please,

27:11.297 --> 27:13.099
just please sit right here,
hold that if you can,

27:13.132 --> 27:15.201
and maybe hang up
the phone, okay?

27:15.234 --> 27:17.636
Thank you. Thank you very much.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.638
All right, guys. Hey!

27:19.672 --> 27:21.373
-Diaz, Buckley, let's go!
-(children giggling)

27:21.407 --> 27:25.644
Did these beauty queens shrink,
or are we suddenly giants?

27:27.747 --> 27:30.016
Please don't arrest me.
I-I'll pay for any medical bills

27:30.049 --> 27:31.617
if we could just let this slide.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.686
I'm so sorry.
I stopped birth control

27:33.720 --> 27:37.056
because I started menopause, and
now my hormones are going crazy.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.458
Can I get my shoe back?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.493
CHIMNEY: Can someone please
bring me the rest of my gear?

27:44.063 --> 27:46.799
I think he means you, guys.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.634
BUCK:
Hey, Athena.

27:48.667 --> 27:52.371
They're, like, the tiniest
ladies I've ever seen.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.573
(high-pitched):
Teeny-tiny. Just...

27:54.606 --> 27:56.876
-Excuse me?
-(whispers): So tiny.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.244
Henrietta!

27:59.611 --> 28:01.380
'Thena.

28:01.413 --> 28:05.684
Oh, 'Thena, you smell like love.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.720
Chimney?

28:07.754 --> 28:10.022
Need you over here.

28:10.056 --> 28:13.092
727-L-30, requesting
immediate R.A. backup

28:13.125 --> 28:15.494
at Beverly Wilton Hotel,
Pacific Ballroom.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.997
-Where the hell is my lido...
-We got a problem here.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.531
Your guys be tripping.

28:19.565 --> 28:22.068
What? Guys, look at me.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.702
Do you know where you are?

28:23.736 --> 28:26.005
We're everywhere, man.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.407
They're on drugs.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.176
-(laughing)
-CHIMNEY: Okay, okay.

28:30.209 --> 28:33.079
Oh. Oh, my God,
it's the brownies.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.847
-Brownies?
-We got a new batch today.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.115
We've been getting a lot
of stuff lately,

28:36.148 --> 28:37.549
especially since the earthquake.

28:37.583 --> 28:38.517
You guys eat that stuff?

28:38.550 --> 28:40.186
We just throw that stuff
right in the trash.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.354
We're firefighters.
Everybody loves us.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.722
Oh...

28:45.457 --> 28:47.393
Now watch this.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.776
You see?

29:03.810 --> 29:05.577
Mm-hmm.

29:05.611 --> 29:08.747
Do you know why the liquid
rises like that?

29:08.781 --> 29:10.649
Physics?

29:10.682 --> 29:12.551
I'm gonna do it again.

29:12.584 --> 29:13.886
-I think...
-No, this is show-and-tell.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.488
It's not show-and-touch, Brook.

29:16.522 --> 29:19.058
I don't want you
to burn yourself.

29:19.091 --> 29:23.029
I'm Taylor. Who's Brook?

29:24.931 --> 29:27.733
There are so many lights
in here.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.401
And colors.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.171
Lights and colors and death.

29:32.204 --> 29:35.174
You died.

29:35.207 --> 29:38.110
Someone died?

29:38.144 --> 29:40.746
Did you lose someone,
Captain Nash?

29:40.779 --> 29:42.581
Brook?

29:42.614 --> 29:45.451
She's not lost.
She's right here.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.257
She's taller
than her mother now.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.759
In a few seconds, she's gonna be
taller than both of us.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.061
TAYLOR:
Hmm.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.098
(echoes):
She's still with you.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.433
(echoes):
She's always with me.

30:01.467 --> 30:04.971
Nobody's picking up
at the fire station.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.338
You should call dispatch,

30:06.372 --> 30:07.706
get them to take
everything off-line.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.275
Did that.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.143
Why aren't you taking it out?

30:11.177 --> 30:12.278
They'll take it out
at the hospital.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.445
So let's go to the hospital.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.780
We'll get you there.
I called 911.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.983
EDDIE:
What's going on?

30:17.016 --> 30:18.784
I don't like this.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.353
-Ooh, you made him cry.
-ATHENA: All right,

30:21.387 --> 30:23.455
just breathe, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

30:23.489 --> 30:27.459
All right? Somebody dosed you
with an hallucinogen.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.029
We don't want you to hurt
yourself or anyone else.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.398
Yeah. I like that idea.

30:32.431 --> 30:35.667
'Thena, your head is beating
like your heart.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.669
Is it?

30:39.771 --> 30:41.407
Still no answer.

30:41.440 --> 30:45.244
Do you know if Bobby ate
any of those brownies?

30:47.179 --> 30:49.281
(siren wailing)

30:55.254 --> 30:57.156
What happened?

30:57.189 --> 30:59.892
He was high,
and then he got higher.

30:59.926 --> 31:02.594
ATHENA: Look at me again
and tell me another joke.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.430
We were talking and he mentioned
something about Brook

31:04.463 --> 31:06.165
and then he shot up
like the room was on fire

31:06.198 --> 31:08.167
-and he said he had to go.
-And you're okay filming this?

31:08.200 --> 31:10.702
Who do you think
called the cops?

31:10.736 --> 31:13.539
Bobby.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.374
Bobby, it's me.

31:17.776 --> 31:21.213
Just take one step back,
turn around, and we can talk.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.553
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.556
They get it wrong,
about saving lives.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.959
The ones that we save
are the ones we lose.

31:32.992 --> 31:36.362
That's why we save them up here,
like photographs.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.531
But this, I've never--
this is new.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.401
She's so bright and alive.
Can you see her?

31:44.236 --> 31:46.205
No.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.407
It's not real. You know that.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.908
No, my daughter Brook, she's...

31:49.942 --> 31:52.144
she's floating in the sky,
behind your head.

31:52.178 --> 31:54.580
I know it sounds crazy.

31:54.613 --> 31:57.383
I-I just want to float away
with her wherever she goes,

31:57.416 --> 31:59.751
with so much color.

31:59.785 --> 32:02.454
It's not real.

32:02.488 --> 32:07.226
But maybe, just maybe,
it can be enough.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.896
Enough for you to say good-bye.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.966
Enough for you to hear
her say it's okay.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.235
Enough so that in the morning,

32:16.268 --> 32:18.904
when your head is right
and your eyes are clear,

32:18.937 --> 32:21.573
you can remember
that you caught a glimpse

32:21.607 --> 32:24.776
of what's around us every day.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.946
She's right there.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.816
Right here, right now.

32:30.849 --> 32:33.619
You're real, I'm real.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.624
We can be real together.

32:48.134 --> 32:49.835
Hey, how's the chief?

32:49.868 --> 32:51.637
Ah, he's in pretty good humor,
considering.

32:51.670 --> 32:54.273
-(chuckles)
-Tox report came back.

32:54.306 --> 32:58.944
It was the brownies. LSD.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.513
Mm. Do they know who?

33:01.547 --> 33:02.981
It's still under investigation,

33:03.015 --> 33:04.883
but they figure
it was some sort of prank.

33:04.916 --> 33:09.288
Oh, yeah. Because poisoning
firefighters is just funny. Ha.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.523
-I don't get the punch line.
-Well, how about this one?

33:11.557 --> 33:15.627
Taylor Kelly's exclusive report
on 118 comes out tomorrow night.

33:15.661 --> 33:16.862
Firefighters drugged
against their will,

33:16.895 --> 33:19.365
captain loses sobriety,
news at 11:00.

33:19.398 --> 33:22.168
Do not waste a moment's worry
on that woman.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.836
It doesn't matter what kind
of take she's trying to spin.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.638
The camera doesn't lie.

33:26.672 --> 33:29.141
Anyone who's watching
is gonna see what I see:

33:29.175 --> 33:32.811
a good man who's been
through some tough times,

33:32.844 --> 33:34.846
but who's come
through the other side--

33:34.880 --> 33:36.915
someone who,
despite everything he's lost,

33:36.948 --> 33:39.318
still goes out there and
risks everything he has left

33:39.351 --> 33:40.552
to help others.

33:40.586 --> 33:44.390
-They're gonna see a hero.
-Hmm.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.892
Athena, I'm an addict
and an alcoholic

33:46.925 --> 33:49.495
who'll have barely three days
under his belt.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.697
I don't feel like a hero.
I feel like a failure.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.832
But you didn't fall
off the wagon. You were pushed.

33:53.865 --> 33:57.836
I know, but I don't feel like
a failure 'cause I got high.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.606
I feel like a failure because
I want to get high again.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.710
It felt good.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.578
You know, it made me feel free.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.347
I-I didn't feel
as much of the pain.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.515
I felt like it was far away,

34:09.548 --> 34:11.583
like it belonged
to somebody else.

34:11.617 --> 34:13.352
And I felt like if I could
just keep floating,

34:13.385 --> 34:16.355
I wouldn't have to feel anymore.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.857
Well, when I saw you after that,

34:18.890 --> 34:21.260
it looked like
you were feeling all of it.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.895
Yeah. Reality always catches up.

34:23.929 --> 34:27.133
If it didn't, none of us
would ever get sober again.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.968
But you are, right?

34:30.001 --> 34:32.438
Yes.

34:32.471 --> 34:35.541
But it's... painful.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.909
I go to my meetings
and go to church.

34:37.943 --> 34:39.378
I try to stay on track.

34:39.411 --> 34:42.981
But when I'm sober, I feel this
crushing weight on top of me

34:43.014 --> 34:45.050
and there are times like now
when I feel like

34:45.083 --> 34:47.753
I don't know how much longer
I can keep carrying it.

34:51.089 --> 34:55.994
Well, maybe you should stop
trying to carry it alone.

35:06.638 --> 35:09.341
Did everything kind of sparkle?

35:09.375 --> 35:12.010
Uh, I'd say it was
more glistening,

35:12.043 --> 35:14.246
like the whole world
was covered in dew.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.915
You think this is why
people go to Burning Man?

35:16.948 --> 35:18.284
TAYLOR (on TV):
We see them every day

35:18.317 --> 35:20.819
on the streets of Los Angeles,
running into burning buildings,

35:20.852 --> 35:24.022
pulling people from wrecked cars
and collapsing high-rises

35:24.055 --> 35:27.426
and even saving this reporter
from a helicopter

35:27.459 --> 35:29.528
that spun out of control.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.630
Where's Cap?

35:31.663 --> 35:33.031
He's not watching with us?

35:33.064 --> 35:34.766
No, said he had
other things to do.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.268
(chuckles)
I think his words were

35:36.302 --> 35:38.370
he'd rather do anything
other than this.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.439
They are the brave men and women

35:40.472 --> 35:42.274
of the Los Angeles
Fire Department

35:42.308 --> 35:45.143
and it was my own brush
with death that inspired me

35:45.177 --> 35:46.645
to share their story

35:46.678 --> 35:48.614
so you can all see what it takes

35:48.647 --> 35:51.917
and what it means
to be one of them.

35:55.187 --> 35:57.489
You missed a hell of a show.

35:59.591 --> 36:03.362
(grunts)
All right, how bad was it?

36:03.395 --> 36:05.331
No, not bad at all.

36:05.364 --> 36:08.900
You were barely in it.
Um, it was nice.

36:08.934 --> 36:11.737
You know, kind-kind of
like a puff piece.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.973
She didn't use any of your
interview or mention the LSD.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.576
Why would she leave
that stuff out?

36:17.609 --> 36:21.179
(chuckles) I, um...

36:23.215 --> 36:25.083
I think she likes me.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.519
Hmm.

36:27.553 --> 36:28.720
CHIMNEY (on video):
I mean, what little kid

36:28.754 --> 36:30.155
doesn't want to be
a firefighter?

36:30.188 --> 36:32.258
Especially... a hot firefighter.

36:32.291 --> 36:35.193
HEN (on video): You know,
their skill kept me from dying,

36:35.227 --> 36:37.829
but the way they cared for me...

36:37.863 --> 36:39.998
that's what kept me alive.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.001
BOBBY (on video): The people
we serve have to feel like

36:43.034 --> 36:44.503
they can trust us
and be honest with us;

36:44.536 --> 36:45.771
otherwise,
mistakes can get made.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.006
They were great. And not just
the medical stuff either.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.676
I mean, they just, they seemed
like real decent people.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.878
SANDY (on video):
I worry about them so,

36:52.911 --> 36:55.947
under so much stress
all the time.

36:55.981 --> 37:00.218
I wish I could do something
to-to ease their burden.

37:00.252 --> 37:05.190
A dose of something
to lift their spirits.

37:05.223 --> 37:09.127
Clear their minds.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.898
The store closed hours ago,
but I see a light on.

37:16.268 --> 37:19.305
Sandy, you in here?

37:19.338 --> 37:22.874
(gasps) Is that...?

37:22.908 --> 37:25.377
-(Athena stammers)
-I don't know.

37:25.411 --> 37:29.281
It's some kind of hybrid--
part wild, part domestic cat.

37:29.315 --> 37:33.452
Well, let's hope he's in touch
with his domestic side.

37:33.485 --> 37:34.986
Hey, buddy.

37:35.020 --> 37:38.590
You're okay.

37:38.624 --> 37:41.026
(Athena sighs)

37:42.928 --> 37:47.132
BOBBY:
Sandy. Sandy?

37:51.303 --> 37:53.739
ATHENA:
You sure about this?

37:53.772 --> 37:56.241
(lizard hissing)

37:56.274 --> 37:57.943
Uh, yeah. Pretty sure.

37:57.976 --> 38:01.647
Ah. (laughs)

38:01.680 --> 38:04.249
This doesn't look safe.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.184
I freed my mind.

38:06.217 --> 38:09.755
Then I freed them. Oh. Oh.

38:09.788 --> 38:13.291
Sandy, how much acid
did you take?

38:13.325 --> 38:16.261
Oh, not much. I microdose.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.697
No, ma'am, I don't think you do.

38:18.730 --> 38:21.867
In fact, I think you macrodosed
my entire fire station.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.771
Oh? Guess I put too much.

38:25.804 --> 38:31.610
I-I just wanted to give
you all a little clarity.

38:31.643 --> 38:36.181
In my line of work,
that's called a felony.

38:36.214 --> 38:39.050
(laughs)

38:46.725 --> 38:48.293
TAYLOR (on TV):
All across Los Angeles,

38:48.326 --> 38:50.161
residents are under attack from
a new and troubling threat:

38:50.195 --> 38:52.130
Aedes aegypti,
stealth-like mosquitoes

38:52.163 --> 38:54.900
that have invaded the Southland
and are out for blood.

38:54.933 --> 38:57.335
-NEWSMAN: Wow. Well,
thank you for that story.
-(doorbell rings)

38:57.369 --> 38:58.804
That is some frightening stuff
right there.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.005
NEWSWOMAN: Exactly, we were
just talking about this

39:00.038 --> 39:01.473
in the studio
before we went to air,

39:01.507 --> 39:05.143
-about this very problem...
-Uh, just a minute.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.346
-I'll be right there.
-(TV turns off)

39:11.349 --> 39:13.051
Hi. Come on in.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.853
Hello.

39:16.522 --> 39:21.427
So, I was just out and I saw
this and I thought of you.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.762
What? No.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.230
It's just a housewarming gift.

39:25.263 --> 39:27.666
(rattles)

39:27.699 --> 39:29.701
Oh. Not a book.

39:29.735 --> 39:32.504
DVD. Mission: Impossible.

39:32.538 --> 39:33.739
(laughs)

39:33.772 --> 39:36.041
Uh, you do have
a DVD player, right?

39:36.074 --> 39:40.946
Yeah. And a popcorn maker.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.515
Would you like to hang out
and watch a movie?

39:43.549 --> 39:46.685
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.

39:46.718 --> 39:48.053
(both chuckle)

39:51.923 --> 39:53.759
BUCK: Doesn't look like
you'll have to worry

39:53.792 --> 39:55.360
about traffic anymore.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.395
TAYLOR:
Hey there.

39:57.429 --> 39:59.264
I guess so.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.467
Fire department piece
was pretty well received,

40:01.500 --> 40:03.201
so they're letting me do more.

40:03.234 --> 40:06.204
Nothing major yet,
just mosquitoes

40:06.237 --> 40:10.208
and neighbors fighting
about bamboo, but it's a start.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.911
Well, I will miss hearing
your voice every day.

40:12.944 --> 40:14.546
Uh, I'm happy for you.

40:14.580 --> 40:17.382
And-and I wanted to thank you
for what you did for Bobby,

40:17.415 --> 40:20.719
not using any
of that stuff he said.

40:20.752 --> 40:21.987
Oh, that wasn't my call.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.555
I wanted to use all of it.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.123
I got overruled.

40:25.156 --> 40:28.627
Uh, wait, you-you
were gonna use it?

40:28.660 --> 40:30.328
Hell yeah.
The only reason we didn't

40:30.361 --> 40:32.330
is because apparently
your lawyers

40:32.363 --> 40:33.965
are scarier than ours.

40:33.999 --> 40:36.401
Look, your job is saving lives.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.769
Mine is telling their stories,

40:37.803 --> 40:39.505
even the ones
they might not want me to.

40:39.538 --> 40:43.742
And some stupid job is all
you really care about.

40:43.775 --> 40:46.912
Hey, I wanted to be a reporter
since I was 14.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.814
I put myself through college,

40:48.847 --> 40:51.349
spent years interning
for next to no pay.

40:51.382 --> 40:54.753
I did traffic in the hopes that
it would lead to my big break,

40:54.786 --> 40:56.622
which it did.

40:56.655 --> 40:59.024
This stupid job
isn't stupid to me.

40:59.057 --> 41:00.592
You don't have to like it,

41:00.626 --> 41:03.461
but you don't get to make me
feel bad about it.

41:05.831 --> 41:08.534
Well, I don't like it.

41:08.567 --> 41:10.769
And I don't care.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.739
Just get a room already.

41:20.879 --> 41:24.449
* There are days...

41:24.482 --> 41:25.617
(doorbell rings)

41:25.651 --> 41:26.785
-Mm.
-Is he here?

41:26.818 --> 41:30.288
-Yeah, okay.
-Oh, yeah.

41:30.321 --> 41:33.158
-Hey, I got the batteries.
-Hey, you are a lifesaver.

41:33.191 --> 41:34.793
-Thank you so much, my man.
-No problem, no problem.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.829
-Wow. Wow.
-(laughs)

41:37.863 --> 41:40.566
I told him to just use
the cell phone camera,

41:40.599 --> 41:42.067
but he's old-school.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.135
Oh, he's a proud father.
He wants those real photos.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.637
All right,
you want something to eat?

41:45.671 --> 41:46.638
-We have plenty.
-I'm good.

41:46.672 --> 41:48.073
MICHAEL:
Hey, hey, Harry.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.641
Come over here and take one
with your sister.

41:49.675 --> 41:51.910
-Right here, right here.
-Run, Bobby. Save yourself.

41:51.943 --> 41:54.245
-(laughs)
-Right here. Just right here.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.982
This doesn't, uh, resemble my
high school homecoming at all.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.051
-It's much more elaborate
than I expected.
-I know. Mine, either.

42:00.085 --> 42:02.053
I am already dreading prom.

42:02.087 --> 42:04.055
You know about
prom proposals, right?

42:04.089 --> 42:06.825
-I do not.
-What? Google it.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.160
-Another reason to be glad
we're not teenagers anymore.
-(Bobby laughs)

42:09.194 --> 42:10.328
HARRY:
Your turn, Mom.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.663
Come on, let's get this
over with.

42:11.697 --> 42:14.065
-All right, you're on.
All right.
-(laughs)

42:14.099 --> 42:16.534
Yeah. Let's do this.

42:16.568 --> 42:18.837
Let's do it. All right.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.572
Oh, yeah, that's it. That's it.

42:20.606 --> 42:21.673
-Ooh.
-Here, here.

42:21.707 --> 42:24.009
Why don't you get in there?
I'll-I'll take a few.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.443
-Oh, with me?
-Yeah.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.045
Oh, man. You know what?
That's nice. That's nice.

42:27.078 --> 42:29.848
-You bet. All right.
-Thank you.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.784
It's the real deal right here.
This is a serious camera.

42:32.818 --> 42:35.687
All right.
One happy-looking family.

42:35.721 --> 42:37.923
-ATHENA: Ah.
-(Bobby laughs)

42:37.956 --> 42:41.459
Oh, honey. What happened
to your bracelet?

42:41.492 --> 42:43.394
It must've fell off.
I have to find it.

42:43.428 --> 42:45.196
-Grandma gave that to me.
-Oh.

42:45.230 --> 42:47.532
BOBBY: Wait, I think this is it
right over here.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.367
Yep. All right.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.569
-MAY: Awesome.
-All right.

42:51.603 --> 42:55.373
Okay, May.
Let's see if I can do this.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.575
-There we go. Perfect.
-Thanks so much, Bobby.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.210
-(laughs)
-All right,
we're back in business.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.246
-Okay.
-All right. Look up here.

43:01.279 --> 43:03.314
MICHAEL: Hey, hey, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

43:03.348 --> 43:05.450
Nico, would you mind taking
a picture of all of us, please?

43:05.483 --> 43:07.786
-Bobby, get in here.
-I shouldn't.
It should just be the family.

43:07.819 --> 43:09.420
Come on. Just one. Come on.

43:09.454 --> 43:11.422
* I'd stop the world
if it gave us time *

43:11.456 --> 43:12.390
Okay. All right.

43:12.423 --> 43:16.494
-(laughs) Right there.
-Okay.

43:16.527 --> 43:20.231
I warned you.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.967
* You open up your heart

43:22.000 --> 43:25.103
* When you love someone

43:25.136 --> 43:28.106
* You make room

43:28.139 --> 43:32.277
* You probably never loved
someone like I do. *

43:43.554 --> 43:46.892
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:13.218 --> 44:15.520
You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

44:15.553 --> 44:17.823
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:20.025 --> 44:21.226
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:23.561 --> 44:25.897
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:25.931 --> 44:29.500
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

44:29.534 --> 44:33.071
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:33.104 --> 44:34.139
MAN: Touchdown!

44:34.172 --> 44:37.709
* Reach out *

44:37.743 --> 44:41.346
* Make this right here
right now *

44:41.379 --> 44:44.282
* Stand up *

44:45.183 --> 44:46.918

44:46.952 --> 44:48.920
That sounds like fun.
