WEBVTT

00:02.952 --> 00:05.079
So, what do you wanna do
this weekend, Shiva?

00:05.255 --> 00:09.021
I've been thinking,
I wanna see the guys from high school.

00:10.126 --> 00:12.754
The guys from high school?
Why would you wanna see them?

00:12.929 --> 00:15.420
These guys, they're degenerates.

00:15.598 --> 00:16.963
I mean, Pete...

00:17.133 --> 00:19.158
Like, in and out of prison,
I'm pretty sure.

00:19.335 --> 00:20.734
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:20.904 --> 00:23.771
And Kevin, oh, he's lost all this weight.

00:23.940 --> 00:26.875
You know, no one's saying anything,
- AIDS.

00:27.043 --> 00:28.635
Okay. What about Rodney?

00:28.812 --> 00:31.303
- You mean Ruxin?
- Yeah, Rodney.

00:31.481 --> 00:33.972
- Yeah, should I not call him that now?
- Ha, ha, ha. Rodney.

00:34.150 --> 00:36.345
No, I just haven't heard
anyone call him that.

00:36.519 --> 00:39.647
No, you definitely... You must call him.

00:39.823 --> 00:42.849
I will when I see them.

00:43.093 --> 00:45.618
- Why are we doing this?
- I wanna see them, come on.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.990
- No, no.
- It'd be so much fun.

00:48.164 --> 00:51.224
- Please?
- Oh, oh, my goodness.

00:51.401 --> 00:53.460
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

00:54.871 --> 00:58.272
Oh, Shiva, oh.

00:58.441 --> 01:02.377
Oh, Shiva.

01:02.545 --> 01:06.072
I wanna snuggle with you and rub off
your luck all over my face and balls.

01:06.249 --> 01:11.915
Oh, I wanna kneel down in front of you
and just savage your downstairs parts.

01:12.088 --> 01:14.318
I wanna ride tandem bicycles with you.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.483
Oh, Shiva, I want to cut your hair
and style it.

01:17.894 --> 01:21.352
Shiva, I like you so hard.

01:21.531 --> 01:23.522
- You like her so hard?
- Yeah.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.692
It's you and me in the Shiva Bowl.
You should be worshiping her.

01:26.870 --> 01:29.998
Gives me a different perspective.
This is the end of the Shiva year.

01:30.173 --> 01:33.108
Why don't we change it?
Next year, we'll call it "trophy."

01:33.276 --> 01:37.007
Shiva. It's always been Shiva.
It always will be Shiva.

01:37.180 --> 01:41.412
Oh, Shiva, I wanna stuff myself
inside of you until I ejaculate.

01:41.584 --> 01:43.347
What? Come on.

01:47.123 --> 01:49.057
I'm telling you, I've done the research.

01:49.225 --> 01:50.249
Facts are facts.

01:50.426 --> 01:53.520
You wanna find a hot woman,
look to the Volkswagen Jetta.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.459
Chances are, there'll be one inside.

01:55.632 --> 01:57.532
- How do you conduct research?
- Three days.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.464
I got disguised as a homeless person,
and I walked downtown.

02:00.637 --> 02:04.471
And whenever I saw a Volkswagen Jetta,
I did a little check on a banana leaf.

02:04.641 --> 02:09.476
And 92 percent of the time,
hot women inside the Volkswagen Jettas.

02:10.045 --> 02:13.709
Why'd you dress up
like a homeless person, Taco?

02:13.883 --> 02:16.408
Because people wouldn't give
a normal person change.

02:16.586 --> 02:18.952
Boys, let's get to it here.

02:19.122 --> 02:20.589
- Offering time.
- Homage time.

02:20.757 --> 02:23.089
- Oh, oh, I have something. I'll be back.
- Oh, boy.

02:23.259 --> 02:25.386
Well, let me go first, guys. The rope.

02:25.562 --> 02:28.463
Not unlike the one that you
so thoroughly enjoyed in gym class.

02:28.631 --> 02:31.998
Oh, my God.
That's where she found her sexuality.

02:32.168 --> 02:35.899
Just going up and then down the rope.
And then up and then shorter down.

02:39.309 --> 02:43.211
- I think you're exaggerating a little bit.
- All right, guys, this is my offering.

02:43.446 --> 02:45.812
<i>Shivakamini</i>

02:45.982 --> 02:49.440
<i>Wanna put my weenie in your vagini</i>

02:49.619 --> 02:50.643
<i>Take down your pants...</i>

02:50.820 --> 02:53.220
- Taco, hey.
- Whoa, you can't make an offering.

02:53.389 --> 02:56.085
Yeah, yeah. No, I actually
wanna win this thing this year.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.784
- No.
- You didn't even make the playoffs, Taco.

02:58.962 --> 03:00.862
- What?
- Andre, please.

03:01.231 --> 03:04.564
- You're up.
- Before I do, I wanna tell you something.

03:04.968 --> 03:07.300
- You coming out of the closet?
- No.

03:07.470 --> 03:09.301
- I have a girlfriend.
- What's his name?

03:09.472 --> 03:11.963
Okay, you know what,
you guys want an offering? Fine.

03:12.141 --> 03:18.546
To my goddess Shiva,
I return the Shiva's panties.

03:20.917 --> 03:24.614
- Uh... No.
- Whose underwear are those?

03:24.787 --> 03:26.914
Shivakamini Somakandarkram.

03:27.090 --> 03:28.489
Oh, who's he?

03:29.292 --> 03:31.453
- Shiva. It's the Shiva.
- Shiva?

03:31.628 --> 03:33.926
- Shiva.
- I'm sorry, how did this happen?

03:34.097 --> 03:35.587
How did it happen? I don't know.

03:35.765 --> 03:39.724
She might have found me pretty attractive
when she was doing rounds at my hospital.

03:40.069 --> 03:42.731
She moved up here from Minneapolis
about three months ago.

03:42.906 --> 03:46.842
She's a doctor now.
But it turns out, she's awesome.

03:47.010 --> 03:50.070
So now I am actually
having sex with Shiva.

03:50.246 --> 03:52.373
I'm going to win the Shiva.

03:52.548 --> 03:54.914
And I'm all about Shiva.

03:55.084 --> 03:56.779
What did she say about the League?

03:56.953 --> 03:59.421
- Yeah, I didn't.
- Oh, right, that would be...

03:59.589 --> 04:03.286
And that is why I'm talking to you now.

04:03.459 --> 04:06.917
I need all you sucktards
to keep your mouth shut.

04:07.196 --> 04:10.359
Okay? This is our secret.
It's how we have to play it.

04:10.533 --> 04:14.560
How are you gonna be quiet? How can you
not tell Shiva you're in the Shiva Bowl?

04:14.737 --> 04:18.696
I think it's pretty easy to keep my
Fantasy Football life away from my real life.

04:18.942 --> 04:22.742
Last thing I need you guys to do is drop it
in the middle of a game or anything.

04:22.912 --> 04:25.403
Look, I'm not gonna do anything
to ruin your chances.

04:25.581 --> 04:27.776
- I'll win on my own merit.
- You're gonna lose.

04:27.951 --> 04:30.715
- And this man right here is gonna win.
- Thank you.

04:30.887 --> 04:33.788
- Because he's balls-deep in Shiva.
- Yeah.

04:33.957 --> 04:36.482
- Okay, all right.
- Let's celebrate, shots, shots.

04:36.659 --> 04:39.719
Yeah, I don't know, I have to drive home.
And so do you.

04:39.896 --> 04:41.329
- I'm not driving.
- You cabbing it?

04:41.497 --> 04:42.486
No, I'm not gonna leave my car here.

04:45.050 --> 04:46.415
- Okay, who's Ruxin?
- That's me.

04:47.586 --> 04:49.679
- You call for roadside assistance?
- Indeed.

04:49.855 --> 04:52.119
And what seems to be the problem
with the car?

04:52.291 --> 04:53.952
Operator error.

04:54.727 --> 04:57.093
- You mean you're too drunk to drive?
- Bingo.

04:57.262 --> 04:59.355
Why don't you call a cab,
have a friend drive?

04:59.531 --> 05:03.592
Because I have premium-plus service,
which means I get 200 miles of free towing.

05:05.104 --> 05:07.971
- All right, give me a minute to hook it up.
- Thank you.

05:09.074 --> 05:11.736
Hey, hey, hey. Check it out, check it out.

05:14.079 --> 05:15.376
What'd I tell you?

05:15.547 --> 05:17.606
Hot girl, Volkswagen Jetta.

05:17.783 --> 05:20.411
It's a law, like water or dinosaurs.

05:20.586 --> 05:23.180
Neither one of those things are laws,
Taco.

05:23.355 --> 05:24.754
You guys ready?

05:24.923 --> 05:26.185
Good to go.

05:27.292 --> 05:29.817
Taco, why are you coming?
You live a block away from the bar.

05:29.995 --> 05:31.724
So? I'll crash at your place tonight.

05:31.897 --> 05:34.832
I like going for rides. Whoo-hoo.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.273
- I'm here to help you crush Pete.
- Thank you.

05:42.441 --> 05:46.241
What you need to do is drop the Vikings
defense and pick up the Cardinals defense.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.107
No, you tinker too much, all right?

05:48.280 --> 05:50.646
- Let's just keep what we have.
- Tinkering works.

05:50.816 --> 05:53.011
If it worked,
we'd be playing in the Super Bowl.

05:53.185 --> 05:55.415
- It's Shiva Bowl.
- I don't recognize that term.

05:55.788 --> 05:58.382
- Check this out.
- Oh, boy, little children, huh?

05:58.557 --> 06:00.582
- Nervous?
- Pfft! Are you kidding me?

06:00.759 --> 06:04.718
Whatever Andre had going for him
Ruxin has surely soiled by now.

06:04.897 --> 06:06.159
- Give it to me.
- Numb nuts.

06:06.331 --> 06:07.525
- Hey, little cuties.
- Hey.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.031
This is a closed session.

06:09.201 --> 06:15.197
You know, no amount of fiddling
is going to help you now, okay?

06:15.374 --> 06:18.104
- I had a wonderful night with Shiva.
- Please stop that.

06:18.277 --> 06:21.735
All right, it's weird. You got a trophy
with my girlfriend's face on it.

06:21.914 --> 06:24.109
This is the Shiva.
Your girlfriend is Shiva.

06:24.283 --> 06:25.807
I know, but it's the same thing.

06:25.984 --> 06:27.713
- Completely different.
- It is not.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.452
- Agree to disagree.
- <i>Tickle me, and rub my belly</i>

06:30.622 --> 06:33.489
- Oh, hey, what's up, boys?
- Hey.

06:33.659 --> 06:35.490
Thanks for letting me borrow
your sweatpants and your underwear.

06:35.661 --> 06:38.994
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Do you mind if I use the kitchen for a bit?

06:39.164 --> 06:43.225
Make whatever you want. Just clean up.
Jenny and Ellie are gonna come home.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.165
No problem. No problem.

06:45.337 --> 06:47.498
I know what Tom Cruise felt like
in <i>Rain Man.</i>

06:47.673 --> 06:51.609
I dropped some toothpicks on the floor
one time and he counted them quickly.

06:51.777 --> 06:54.245
- He got it completely wrong.
- But he was very quick.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.143
I'm gonna order a pizza.
You staying around for the game?

06:57.316 --> 06:59.409
- Yep.
- We are famished.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.416
- Please.
- I am not going to be here.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.647
Because I'm going to be
with my good luck charm, Shiva.

07:05.124 --> 07:06.489
Let me tell you something.

07:06.658 --> 07:10.651
Since I started dating Shiva,
I have not lost a single game, not a one.

07:10.829 --> 07:14.492
You're using an unfair,
competitive, sexual advantage.

07:14.666 --> 07:17.362
All I know is I'm gonna take that trophy
from your hands...

07:17.536 --> 07:21.597
...hold it over my head, and tell everyone,
"I, Andre, won the Super Bowl."

07:21.774 --> 07:23.674
- Shiva Bowl.
- Super Bowl.

07:23.842 --> 07:26.276
I don't recognize that.
I don't know what that is.

07:26.545 --> 07:28.513
All I know is when I hold it, I will sing.

07:28.680 --> 07:29.669
- You wanna sing?
- Oh, I will sing.

07:31.731 --> 07:34.291
RUXIN, KEVIN & PETE :
<i>Shivakamini Somakandarkram</i>

07:34.468 --> 07:35.730
Really?

07:35.902 --> 07:38.029
We're doing this, really. "Shiva Nagila"?

07:38.205 --> 07:39.797
Okay, can we stop?

07:39.973 --> 07:41.440
<i>Hey! Shivakamini Somakandarkram</i>

07:41.608 --> 07:42.802
Oh, great.

07:43.877 --> 07:46.812
More? You didn't get enough in high school?

07:48.281 --> 07:49.942
<i>Hey! Shivakamini Somakandarkram</i>

07:50.116 --> 07:52.482
Great. That's enough.

07:53.820 --> 07:56.789
All right, enough, enough, enough. Stop.

07:57.390 --> 08:00.052
Got it out of your system?
Not gonna do that for 15 years?

08:00.227 --> 08:02.127
Taco, what's that smell?
You smell that?

08:02.295 --> 08:04.126
- Thought it was your house.
- Not my house.

08:04.364 --> 08:06.662
- Oh, shit.
- What's "oh, shit"?

08:06.833 --> 08:09.961
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ow! Ow! Ow!

08:10.570 --> 08:12.834
- Taco, what are you doing?
- Oh, goddamn it.

08:13.006 --> 08:15.839
- No brownies.
- Oh, Jesus.

08:16.009 --> 08:19.069
- Ugh!
- It smells like squirrel diarrhea in here.

08:19.246 --> 08:21.771
No, I'm making homemade deodorant.
I think I burned it.

08:22.315 --> 08:25.944
- lf it's deodorant, why does it stink so bad?
- It's musk scent.

08:26.119 --> 08:27.643
Why are you making your own?

08:27.821 --> 08:30.483
Trying to save money.
You know how expensive deodorant is?

08:30.657 --> 08:32.453
- It's like four bucks.
- I know, right?

08:32.626 --> 08:34.991
You need to get a job.
Do you understand me?

08:35.160 --> 08:36.684
I have a job. I make ring tones.

08:36.863 --> 08:40.025
- What do you mean?
- I have a "cats having sex" ring tone.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.861
I have a "cats fighting" ring tone.

08:42.034 --> 08:44.595
Well, it's the same audio.
I just changed the title.

08:44.771 --> 08:48.332
- I have a "horse orgasm" ring tone.
- Oh, wait, "horse-gasm" is yours?

08:48.508 --> 08:49.736
Yeah, yeah, the:

08:51.378 --> 08:54.609
All right, can you guys please stop?
The free ride's over.

08:54.781 --> 08:57.545
You cannot come back
until you have gainful employment.

08:57.717 --> 08:59.184
All right, fine. I'll get a job.

08:59.486 --> 09:00.851
- Please.
- Okay, I'll go now.

09:01.254 --> 09:03.745
No, no, whoa, just... No, no. Just lea...

09:03.924 --> 09:05.551
Keep the clothes on, okay, buddy?

09:05.959 --> 09:08.553
Keep the underwear.
Make them your interview underwear.

09:08.728 --> 09:09.854
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:10.463 --> 09:12.328
All right. Now I have three pairs.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.794
Joseph, you're killing me.
You're killing me.

09:15.969 --> 09:17.231
His second touchdown today.

09:17.404 --> 09:19.338
- I am beating you.
- What?

09:20.040 --> 09:22.338
- We are beating you.
- Who's we? What...?

09:22.509 --> 09:24.602
Andre is beating you and I am helping.

09:26.695 --> 09:27.855
That's really desperate.

09:28.163 --> 09:29.755
All right, guys. This is problematic.

09:29.932 --> 09:32.560
I know what the issue is here.
He's got the real Shiva.

09:32.735 --> 09:34.794
I'm stuck with this trophy.
No way I can win.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.733
I gotta change the energy up.

09:36.905 --> 09:39.100
- Who's up for a field trip?
- Where?

09:39.274 --> 09:41.208
- We're going to Shiva's house now.
- What?

09:41.376 --> 09:44.709
- How do you know where she lives?
- Stole her address from Andre's phone.

09:45.347 --> 09:47.178
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:47.349 --> 09:48.475
Nicely played.

09:48.784 --> 09:50.342
- Let's get something to eat.
- No, no.

09:50.519 --> 09:53.955
Why are we gonna go out?
Let's just stay here and stay comfy.

09:54.123 --> 09:56.887
And let me keep you all to me, okay?

09:57.059 --> 09:59.550
And we can watch the game. Perfect.

09:59.728 --> 10:01.286
Game?

10:01.463 --> 10:03.897
Winter Olympics on?
I didn't know it was coming back.

10:04.066 --> 10:07.467
- No, football.
- Oh, wow. All right. I don't really watch.

10:07.636 --> 10:10.799
- Well, let me take a look at this, let's see.
- Okay.

10:11.573 --> 10:14.974
Oh, you don't have
the NFL Super Fan package?

10:15.144 --> 10:16.907
No, who cares? Really?

10:17.079 --> 10:20.014
Well, I mean, who cares?
I mean, if you only got like one game.

10:20.182 --> 10:22.446
What if I wanna watch
Kansas City and Cincinnati?

10:22.618 --> 10:24.085
See how Cedric Benson does.

10:24.253 --> 10:25.584
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

10:25.754 --> 10:27.847
- Like, I'm just making up that name.
- Right.

10:28.023 --> 10:29.320
Doesn't even... Well...

10:31.393 --> 10:32.690
- Someone at the door?
- Yeah.

10:34.763 --> 10:36.355
Oh, my gosh.

10:36.532 --> 10:37.692
Shivakamini.

10:37.866 --> 10:40.027
- How are you?
- This is amazing.

10:40.202 --> 10:42.193
Look who is here.

10:42.471 --> 10:44.439
This is crazy. Did you do this?

10:46.421 --> 10:47.479
This is why you wanted to stay in,
wasn't it?

10:47.656 --> 10:49.123
Yes, yes, this is it.

10:49.291 --> 10:53.455
Well, we just wanted to stop by
and see Shivakamini.

10:53.629 --> 10:55.961
Please, just call me Shiva, really. Ha, ha.

10:56.131 --> 10:57.359
Shiva.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.467
- That has a nice ring to it.
- Strange.

10:59.635 --> 11:01.227
We had a good time, didn't we?

11:01.403 --> 11:03.564
You guys came to say hi.
See you guys later.

11:03.739 --> 11:05.536
What? No, that is crazy, come on.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.471
Come inside. Make yourselves at home.
Get comfortable.

11:08.644 --> 11:10.271
We could come in for a little bit.

11:10.445 --> 11:12.208
- How are you?
- Great.

11:14.000 --> 11:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:28.397 --> 11:30.262
My name is Taco,
and I wanna work here.

11:30.432 --> 11:33.162
I just wanna hear about you.
What are you up to these days?

11:33.335 --> 11:36.168
I'm a urologist,
specializing in genital reconstruction.

11:36.338 --> 11:38.806
- Oh, so that's how you guys met?
- Ha. Rodney.

11:39.341 --> 11:41.536
- Rodney.
- Ruxin.

11:41.710 --> 11:42.802
- Rodney.
- Rodney.

11:42.978 --> 11:44.138
Rodney works for us.

11:44.313 --> 11:47.476
I have to say, I'm so happy
that you're back in our lives.

11:47.649 --> 11:49.708
- You rule, I mean, come on...
- Hey, thank you.

11:49.885 --> 11:51.944
- Put it up.
- Yeah.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.144
Yeah, okay.

11:53.322 --> 11:55.722
- Get over here, get over here.
- No, no, no.

11:55.891 --> 11:57.290
She's all mine.

11:57.459 --> 11:59.188
- Hi, Taco.
- What's up, boys?

11:59.361 --> 12:02.888
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Pete gave me the address.

12:03.065 --> 12:04.589
I like the new pad. Nice.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.667
It's not my house, all right?
This is Shiva's house.

12:07.836 --> 12:08.894
Taco.

12:09.071 --> 12:10.732
- Shiva.
- Yeah.

12:10.906 --> 12:12.168
Like the song...

12:12.341 --> 12:13.899
<i>- Shivaka...</i>
- No... Ow.

12:14.076 --> 12:16.544
- He's a musician.
- Taco's a musician.

12:16.712 --> 12:17.872
And he has songs.

12:18.046 --> 12:21.277
- And today, I got a real-person job.
- What?

12:21.450 --> 12:22.474
- Yeah.
- Really?

12:22.651 --> 12:24.346
I work at the Volkswagen dealership.

12:24.519 --> 12:25.781
Yeah, and I really like it.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.718
Hey, this morning,
I was making my own deodorant.

12:28.890 --> 12:30.653
Now, look at me, huh?

12:30.826 --> 12:32.657
Taco, would you like a drink?

12:32.828 --> 12:34.659
- Absolutely.
- I will get you one.

12:34.830 --> 12:36.821
- Taco, oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

12:36.999 --> 12:39.524
Okay, seriously,
this has to end right now.

12:39.701 --> 12:41.601
- You have to leave.
- No, we're having fun.

12:41.770 --> 12:43.237
You are not. You have to leave.

12:43.405 --> 12:45.100
You have to leave right now.

12:45.941 --> 12:49.138
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Just getting a little good luck charm.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.472
No, no, no, you take nothing. Nothing.

12:51.647 --> 12:54.616
You better watch out
because Ruxin went for the laundry room.

12:54.783 --> 12:57.217
- Shit.
- Go, go, go.

12:58.887 --> 13:02.220
- What's wrong with you over here?
- I am going crazy sitting next to her.

13:02.391 --> 13:05.656
- What is your problem?
- Because I feel like I'm in Shiva's place.

13:05.827 --> 13:08.057
And this would be
the ultimate Shiva blast.

13:08.230 --> 13:09.629
- Oh, no, Shiva blast.
- Awesome?

13:09.798 --> 13:10.822
Dude, l... All right.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.126
- Hold it.
- I can't, it's like a giant dump.

13:13.302 --> 13:14.360
You can hold it.

13:14.536 --> 13:17.096
- Kevin, hold it.
- Oh, Shiva!

13:17.272 --> 13:19.740
- Go outside.
- Shiva... I can't do it.

13:19.908 --> 13:22.240
- I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do it.
- Outside, now.

13:22.644 --> 13:24.407
Did he just Shiva blast in here?

13:24.579 --> 13:27.980
- I didn't hear anything, you hear anything?
- I don't know what he did.

13:28.617 --> 13:30.585
- Give me this.
- This is such a great party.

13:30.752 --> 13:32.777
- Thank you so much.
- Put that back.

13:32.954 --> 13:36.219
- Do not shell-game me with your hoody.
- I'm not shell-gaming you.

13:36.391 --> 13:39.758
- I have a hoody. I know how it works.
- Your hoody's orange with sequins.

13:40.162 --> 13:42.221
Same thing. Thank you. Thank you.

13:42.397 --> 13:45.457
Did you notice that girl looks exactly
like the girl on the trophy?

13:46.234 --> 13:48.600
- You think? Yeah. Because she is.
- Yeah.

13:49.805 --> 13:55.072
- Great job, brainiac. You figured it out.
- It's such a weird coincidence.

13:55.243 --> 14:01.614
Shivakamini Somakandarkram!

14:07.322 --> 14:09.756
So the Monday night game
decides the Shiva Bowl.

14:09.925 --> 14:13.053
Just because we're going head-to-head
doesn't mean we can't enjoy...

14:13.228 --> 14:14.354
...a gentlemanly lunch.

14:14.529 --> 14:19.091
good, kind, gentlemanly competition.

14:19.267 --> 14:21.531
Can I offer to buy you a beverage?
A beer perhaps?

14:21.703 --> 14:23.068
Thank you, sir, but, no.

14:23.238 --> 14:26.264
May I purchase you an ale
of any variety you choose?

14:26.441 --> 14:29.672
I have an examination this afternoon.
So I will also have to decline.

14:29.845 --> 14:31.870
Oh, I am very sorry to hear that.

14:32.047 --> 14:35.073
- Who are you seeing?
- A specialist.

14:35.550 --> 14:37.677
- Anyone I might know, perchance?
- Probably not.

14:37.853 --> 14:39.343
Her name's Shiva.

14:41.957 --> 14:43.549
No. No.

14:43.725 --> 14:44.749
No, no, no.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.689
What? I have swollen testicles.

14:46.862 --> 14:47.954
She's the best in town.

14:48.130 --> 14:50.030
I wanna have them fondled,
professionally.

14:50.198 --> 14:52.257
Her hands are not going anywhere
near you.

14:52.434 --> 14:55.426
- I don't know what's wrong.
- I'll look at your testicles for you.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.765
I'd prefer
to have the specialist look at them.

14:57.939 --> 15:00.271
I can see why Meegan left you.
I see it. I see it.

15:00.442 --> 15:02.967
- Because you're duplicitous.
- What does that word mean?

15:03.145 --> 15:05.545
- She is my girlfriend.
- She's my doctor.

15:05.714 --> 15:06.908
She is not your doctor.

15:07.082 --> 15:09.209
You have nothing wrong with your balls.

15:09.384 --> 15:13.047
This is not about Fantasy Football.
This is about my girlfriend.

15:13.422 --> 15:15.686
Mm-hm. And it's about my testicles...

15:15.857 --> 15:18.257
...in your girlfriend's hands
in 30 minutes.

15:18.427 --> 15:21.260
If you don't mind picking
up the check, that'd be great.

15:21.897 --> 15:24.832
Oh, you think she'd check
my prostate if I asked?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.831
Oh, no, no, no!

15:27.269 --> 15:32.468
You know what? I'm gonna find Meegan,
I'm gonna get her to give me a hand job.

15:33.575 --> 15:34.940
I don't even know where she lives.

15:37.660 --> 15:38.388
All right. Let me take a look at her.

15:38.895 --> 15:41.329
I don't know what happened.
It's from all the towing.

15:41.497 --> 15:43.488
I see this kind of thing all the time.

15:43.666 --> 15:45.531
- I'll have the boys look.
- Appreciate it.

15:45.701 --> 15:48.067
I'm running to this meeting,
and it's a huge help.

15:48.237 --> 15:49.329
Cannot thank you enough.

15:49.505 --> 15:51.336
If you ever own a huge toy company...

15:51.507 --> 15:55.136
...and it turns out your pacifiers
are made of Chinese lead, I'm your guy.

15:55.311 --> 15:57.836
- Thank you.
- All right, let's...

15:58.548 --> 15:59.947
Have a good meeting.

16:00.116 --> 16:01.811
Okay.

16:07.557 --> 16:09.457
- Yeah.
- Hey.

16:09.625 --> 16:12.185
- What are you doing here?
- Came out to get a bit of air.

16:12.361 --> 16:14.829
Get your overalls on,
grab your mop, get out there.

16:14.997 --> 16:17.261
- A kid pissed all over the showroom floor.
- Again?

16:17.433 --> 16:19.799
- Yeah. Let's go, go clean up.
- I'm on it, boss.

16:20.369 --> 16:24.533
<i>Gonna clean up some pee-pee</i>
<i>Cleaning up the pee-pee</i>

16:24.707 --> 16:28.700
And just so you know,
this is a very minor exam.

16:28.878 --> 16:32.075
I'm sure everything's fine.
And it's going to go very quickly.

16:32.248 --> 16:34.113
I don't think we need to go quick.

16:34.283 --> 16:36.444
I'd rather leave knowing
we were very thorough.

16:36.619 --> 16:38.985
Really got in there root around.
Do what it takes.

16:39.155 --> 16:41.055
- Strictly professional.
- Absolutely.

16:41.224 --> 16:43.954
- So tell me, have you had...?
- His balls are fine.

16:46.162 --> 16:47.823
Oh, okay, great. So it didn't start.

16:47.997 --> 16:50.056
- What are you doing?
- In the neighborhood.

16:50.233 --> 16:51.632
You didn't pick up your phone.

16:51.801 --> 16:53.166
- I'm at work.
- I know.

16:53.336 --> 16:56.464
- So...
- You should check for emergencies.

16:56.639 --> 16:58.504
And I just wanted to come in...

16:58.674 --> 17:02.075
...and tell you, there's no need
to check his balls, his balls are fine.

17:02.245 --> 17:05.646
His testicles, I'm sure, are fine.

17:05.815 --> 17:08.943
That's what we're going to find out
if you'd give us a few minutes.

17:09.117 --> 17:12.781
- Not sure what the problem is, Dr. Nozic.
- The problem is, you are a deviant.

17:12.954 --> 17:16.789
- I'm not sure this ball-fondling is on the up...
- Testicles.

17:16.959 --> 17:19.154
Testicle fondling is on the up and up.

17:19.328 --> 17:21.592
- Why else would he be here?
- Yes, Andre.

17:21.763 --> 17:23.095
Why else would I be here...

17:23.266 --> 17:26.598
...if I was not concerned
about the welfare of my testicles?

17:27.569 --> 17:31.597
Because he...
I don't know, you just gotta trust me.

17:31.774 --> 17:35.437
- You have to trust me on this.
- Andre, you have to trust me too, okay?

17:35.611 --> 17:38.171
- You're making the patient uncomfortable.
- Okay.

17:38.714 --> 17:42.241
If this makes it easier, if you wanna stay
and watch, you know, that's fine.

17:42.418 --> 17:46.218
I mean, I wouldn't mind getting
a second pair of eyes on these pair.

17:46.689 --> 17:49.055
Andre, do you want to stay?

17:49.225 --> 17:51.125
Yeah. Yeah.

17:51.294 --> 17:55.890
- Would you walk me through the procedure?
- Sure.

17:56.065 --> 17:59.796
I'm just basically going to be checking
on your testicles, one by one...

17:59.969 --> 18:02.369
...making sure that
everything's in the right place.

18:02.538 --> 18:04.768
Palpitating each, and
checking the scrotal sack.

18:04.941 --> 18:07.136
To be clear,
my testicles will be in your hands.

18:07.310 --> 18:09.904
Then you'll fondle the right one,
the left one, okay.

18:10.079 --> 18:12.775
Anything near the shaft area...

18:12.949 --> 18:15.509
...or the lower shaft?
- Definitely, the lower shaft.

18:15.685 --> 18:17.277
- Sounds good.
- Great, all right.

18:17.453 --> 18:19.683
Just relax. I'm going to lift your gown.

18:19.855 --> 18:21.083
- Okay.
- It's a little cold.

18:21.257 --> 18:23.987
All right. And they are asymmetrical.

18:24.827 --> 18:27.261
And looking healthy so far.

18:27.430 --> 18:29.921
- Okay.
- No sign of hernia.

18:30.099 --> 18:31.726
And...

18:31.901 --> 18:34.597
If you could just give me
a good, deep cough, please.

18:35.972 --> 18:37.599
That's great.

18:38.941 --> 18:41.637
Everything looks okay, all right.
You doing okay?

18:41.811 --> 18:44.109
- No!
- What, Andre?

18:44.280 --> 18:46.942
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Unprofessional.

18:47.116 --> 18:49.607
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Unprofessional.

18:51.621 --> 18:53.088
Ha, ha, ha. The king is dead.

18:53.256 --> 18:54.348
The king is dead!

18:54.523 --> 18:57.185
Oh, Lord. The king is dead. Ha, ha, ha.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.488
Pete lost. We won. I'm gonna
take Shiva and make her mine.

19:00.663 --> 19:03.029
And I'll deliver her to Andre tomorrow.
Oh, God.

19:03.199 --> 19:05.497
- We won.
- Oh, Rodney!

19:05.668 --> 19:07.829
Goddamn it!

19:08.004 --> 19:09.437
- No.
- I forgot my keys.

19:09.605 --> 19:10.799
- Get...
- Where are my keys?

19:10.973 --> 19:12.531
- I don't know.
- In my pocket.

19:12.708 --> 19:15.006
- They're in my pocket.
- Argh!

19:16.779 --> 19:21.648
Oh, you son of a bitch.

19:22.184 --> 19:24.618
I hate my friends!

19:41.786 --> 19:43.048
Right.

19:46.490 --> 19:48.924
- Good afternoon, miss.
- Hi.

19:49.093 --> 19:51.425
- What are we looking at, the Jetta?
- How'd you know?

19:51.595 --> 19:52.926
I had a feeling.

19:53.097 --> 19:56.931
The car is made of 100-percent
hard material.

19:57.101 --> 20:01.435
There's a V engine in there.
A certain amount of horsepower.

20:01.605 --> 20:05.507
Here we got some tires.
They are ribbed, for the road's pleasure.

20:05.676 --> 20:08.941
- How convenient.
- We got a option for a kayak holder...

20:09.113 --> 20:11.741
...if you're interested.
- I don't think I would need it.

20:11.916 --> 20:15.852
Say that now, but after a day of kayaking,
your arms will be tired. Think about it.

20:16.120 --> 20:21.057
So if we're gonna talk prices, this model is
the deluxe model, little more expensive.

20:21.225 --> 20:25.491
Lot of bells and whistles, but take out
the windshield, pull out the exhaust...

20:25.663 --> 20:28.996
...and you knock $3000 off the total price.
- It's still a little steep.

20:29.166 --> 20:32.329
I'll tell you what. There is one more package
I can offer you.

20:32.503 --> 20:34.630
And I only offer it to special clients.

20:34.805 --> 20:39.003
It is the Taco package,
and you save $8000 of the total price.

20:39.176 --> 20:42.634
- And what's included in that package?
- I am.

20:42.813 --> 20:44.974
How long are you including
the package for?

20:45.149 --> 20:48.585
About a couple days, a week at most.
What do you say?

20:48.753 --> 20:52.814
- So when do I actually pay for this?
- We'll talk about that over margaritas.

20:52.990 --> 20:56.653
Hey, hey, hey!
Bring back that car, you asshole!

20:56.827 --> 20:57.816
Damn it.

20:59.912 --> 21:01.106
Oh, man.
What's going on with the car here?

21:01.414 --> 21:04.906
Oh, Taco, you goddamn idiot.
I'm gonna...

21:05.084 --> 21:06.073
Ugh!

21:11.057 --> 21:12.752
Yeah, hello, roadside assistance?

21:12.925 --> 21:14.654
Yeah, Ruxin.

21:15.294 --> 21:17.694
No, no, no.
Well, you have to pick me up.

21:17.863 --> 21:19.091
I've got premium plus.

21:19.265 --> 21:21.825
What do you mean I used up
all of my miles?

21:22.234 --> 21:24.668
Ugh! I should have used a fake name.

21:26.205 --> 21:27.934
Oh, thank God it's a Mercedes. Hey.

21:32.011 --> 21:33.876
- Hi.
- Rodney?

21:34.046 --> 21:35.707
- Hey, people call me Ruxin.
- Hi.

21:35.881 --> 21:37.542
- How are you?
- Are you going to Andre's?

21:37.717 --> 21:39.184
- Yeah.
- Is your car okay?

21:39.352 --> 21:41.013
Thank God.
No, my car broke down.

21:41.187 --> 21:43.951
- Taco got his hands on it.
- Oh, what happened?

21:44.123 --> 21:45.590
Oh, my God.

21:45.758 --> 21:47.589
Is that my high school yearbook photo?

21:47.760 --> 21:50.228
Look, I can explain.

21:51.364 --> 21:53.992
But it's not gonna
make you feel any better.

21:58.170 --> 22:01.003
- Hello?
- <i>Shiva's here.</i>

22:01.173 --> 22:04.609
Oh, I'm coming down to meet you.
I can't wait to see that beautiful bitch.

22:05.444 --> 22:07.036
Aha! See, I told you.

22:07.213 --> 22:10.444
I make love to Shiva,
and then I get the Shiva.

22:10.616 --> 22:12.140
Ugh!

22:13.419 --> 22:14.977
You're such an asshole.

22:18.524 --> 22:20.048
We're cool, right?

22:21.160 --> 22:22.491
See you at the reunion.

22:23.796 --> 22:24.922
I like her.

22:25.398 --> 22:26.490
- Ruxin?
- Yeah?

22:27.566 --> 22:29.193
Why's your name on the trophy?

22:31.168 --> 22:32.157
Because we won.

22:33.103 --> 22:35.469
Oh, Shiva.

22:36.273 --> 22:39.504
This is by far
the most destructive season ever.

22:39.676 --> 22:44.113
And I cannot wait to play next year,
because I shall be victorious!

22:44.281 --> 22:45.680
- No.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

22:45.849 --> 22:47.111
Why?

22:47.284 --> 22:50.412
I got a little Shiva charm,
just to help me into the playoffs.

22:50.587 --> 22:52.350
- You Robin Hood.
- Real Shiva hair too.

22:52.522 --> 22:54.285
- You took that from her house?
- Yeah.

22:54.458 --> 22:58.861
Poor choice, my friend, because
I stole a picture of her and her family.

22:59.029 --> 23:01.190
- A couple generations of Shiva.
- What is this?

23:01.398 --> 23:03.958
I got her silverware.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.364
Because I actually needed silverware.

23:06.636 --> 23:09.434
Taco, you don't need silverware.
You got a job now.

23:09.606 --> 23:11.699
No, I got fired for stealing a car.

23:11.875 --> 23:12.899
Oh. Great.

23:13.510 --> 23:16.741
- Who's buzzing, what is it...?
- Oh, that's right.

23:16.913 --> 23:19.108
- Oh, my God.
- Shiva's vibrator.

23:19.282 --> 23:20.306
- Really?
- Horrible.

23:20.484 --> 23:22.042
I had to get as close as I could.

23:22.219 --> 23:24.915
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah. That was inside.

23:25.088 --> 23:27.386

23:27.557 --> 23:30.117

<i>Somakandarkram, hey</i>

23:35.465 --> 23:40.164

23:40.337 --> 23:45.172
