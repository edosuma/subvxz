00:07.420 --> 00:09.832
[theme music playing]

00:27.650 --> 00:30.437
[Hannah]
Some girls know all the lyrics
to each other’s songs

00:35.410 --> 00:37.526
They ﬁnd harmonies in their laughter.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.417
Their linked elbows echo in tune.

00:48.540 --> 00:50.451
What if] can ’t hum on key?

00:51.840 --> 00:54.411
What ifmy melodies are the ones
nobody hears?

00:55.340 --> 00:56.420
[birds chirping]

00:59.680 --> 01:00.669
[Clay] Whoo!

01:00.760 --> 01:03.228
-We're really freakin' high!
-Don't think about it.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.347
Just remember, you gotta go slow
if you want to climb fast.

01:08.150 --> 01:09.265
All right.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.099
[screams]

01:17.990 --> 01:20.151
So, what happened out there
in the hallway?

01:20.450 --> 01:23.442
[sighs] I don't know. Tired, I guess.

01:23.870 --> 01:24.859
Tired?

01:26.250 --> 01:27.239
Tired of what?

01:28.000 --> 01:29.206
Just tired.

01:29.580 --> 01:31.411
Seems like you were angry.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.332
At this school. About Hannah.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.335
Aren't you?

01:39.470 --> 01:41.426
Angry about another needless death.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.267
I'm sad for Hannah...

01:45.270 --> 01:46.840
and for all of us who...

01:47.730 --> 01:48.936
who cared about her.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.726
So, are you gonna punish me or what?

01:53.980 --> 01:55.641
Is that what you want me to do?

01:56.070 --> 01:59.198
Do you get a lot of kids coming
in here asking for punishment?

01:59.360 --> 02:00.361
[Mr. Porter chuckles]

02:02.120 --> 02:03.860
What do you think
your punishment should be?

02:04.450 --> 02:05.747
Isn't that your job?

02:06.830 --> 02:09.492
I mean, it's not like you're trained
to be a shrink or anything, right?

02:09.580 --> 02:10.706
No.

02:11.290 --> 02:13.372
But I like to think I can be helpful...

02:13.550 --> 02:15.450
to kids who are hurting,

02:15.550 --> 02:18.462
not in touch with
what they're feeling, lonely...

02:18.550 --> 02:20.461
-I'm not lonely.
-Who may hurt themselves.

02:20.550 --> 02:21.539
Not gonna hurt myself.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.756
-Find their way out...
-You don't know what you're talking about.

02:23.890 --> 02:25.050
Hey, screw you!

02:27.980 --> 02:28.969
Okay.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.647
-I'm sorry.
-No, that's okay.

02:32.650 --> 02:33.639
You're hurting.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.606
And I want to help.

02:37.110 --> 02:38.941
I want to be there for you, Clay.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.816
I'm not going to say I understand
just what you're going through,

02:41.910 --> 02:43.571
but if you talk to me...

02:44.830 --> 02:45.819
I'll try.

02:48.580 --> 02:50.491
Everybody wants to talk.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.581
No one wants to do anything.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.086
What is it that you want to do?

03:05.390 --> 03:06.516
I should get to class.

03:10.100 --> 03:13.433
[Hannah]
It all started
because I was feeling lost.

03:15.190 --> 03:16.396
I needed direct'ion.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.229
Any direction.

03:20.530 --> 03:21.690
[indistinct voices]

03:30.120 --> 03:31.200
You have to be kidding me.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.569
Get in the car.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.410
I have something I have to show you.

03:35.420 --> 03:37.206
Tell me how you know what you know.

03:37.630 --> 03:38.870
Tell me what I did to Hannah.

03:42.720 --> 03:43.709
See you, Tony.

03:46.010 --> 03:47.500
Actually, I hope I don't.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.589
Even

03:52.310 --> 03:53.390
[engine starts]

03:53.770 --> 03:54.930
Clay, get in the car.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.509
No.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.856
What are you gonna do?
You have no bike, buddy.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.271
Why can't you leave me alone?

04:02.650 --> 04:04.868
Release the tapes.
Do whatever you have to do.

04:04.950 --> 04:06.269
Just let me be.

04:07.530 --> 04:09.327
I won't release them, if...

04:09.700 --> 04:11.656
if you get in the car and come with me.

04:18.090 --> 04:19.409
-Hi, I'm Kevin Porter.
-Hi.

04:20.590 --> 04:23.297
[Hannah]
And sometimes you take
whatever way out you can find.

04:24.380 --> 04:25.506
All right, just drive.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.841
-Where are we going?
-You'll see when we get there.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.215
He's out of his fucking mind.

04:31.430 --> 04:33.728
We played by Hannah's rules.

04:33.810 --> 04:36.973
It's not fair if the tapes get out there
because Clay went postal.

04:37.060 --> 04:39.688
-He's not gonna go public.
-It feels like he might.

04:39.860 --> 04:42.067
He's just sad, okay? Let him be...

04:42.280 --> 04:44.521
Are you getting
your stomach things again, Alex?

04:44.700 --> 04:47.066
-Come sit down a minute.
-What stomach things?

04:47.160 --> 04:49.151
He loved her, and she died.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.446
Okay? He's going crazy.

04:50.870 --> 04:51.939
Just give him a second.

04:52.290 --> 04:55.168
He's not sad, okay?
He's getting revenge.

04:55.370 --> 04:56.951
It's not like we don't deserve it.

04:57.290 --> 04:59.167
-[gasp51
-Alex, come sit down.

04:59.540 --> 05:00.620
[door opens]

05:00.710 --> 05:02.007
Dude, you're late.

05:02.300 --> 05:04.791
I talked to Tony.
He says he'll take care of it.

05:05.050 --> 05:06.881
What does that even mean exactly?

05:06.970 --> 05:09.177
-Tony's a dick.
-He's not a dick.

05:09.430 --> 05:12.342
He's a dick, he's a prick,
and he's a cock.

05:12.430 --> 05:13.840
Okay, those are the same things.

05:13.930 --> 05:16.137
No, they're nuances of meaning.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.050
Right. Yeah.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.147
Look, Tony's not gonna do shit.

05:20.230 --> 05:22.221
We have to take care of this.

05:22.860 --> 05:24.987
End that little bastard once and for all.

05:25.070 --> 05:26.697
That's insane.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.229
I don't know.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.657
What if we make it look like a suicide.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.575
How tragic is that?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.070
I mean, two star-crossed lovers
or some shit like that.

05:39.170 --> 05:40.489
Grow up, Justin.

05:41.550 --> 05:45.008
Are you really telling me to grow up,
Little Mama's Boy?

05:46.510 --> 05:48.250
Yeah, I am.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.379
[Alex grunts]

05:50.800 --> 05:52.210
Dude, go see a fuckin' doctor.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.596
I've seen a dozen doctors, dude.

05:57.770 --> 05:58.805
One thing.

05:59.650 --> 06:02.392
If one thing had gone differently
somewhere along the line...

06:03.610 --> 06:05.487
maybe none of this would have happened.

06:10.530 --> 06:11.736
It's right over there.

06:17.910 --> 06:19.741
[Hannah]
Dream big, they say.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.911
Shoot for the stars.

06:22.170 --> 06:25.003
Then they lock us away for 12 years
and tell us where to sit;

06:25.090 --> 06:26.717
when to pee, and what to think.

06:27.300 --> 06:31.179
[Marcus] Is it enough to get refs
from the principal and vice-principal?

06:31.260 --> 06:32.921
Should I go to the superintendent?

06:33.010 --> 06:35.922
Our school doesn't weigh our GPA,
so I only have a 4.0.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.760
Will this be a disadvantage?

06:37.850 --> 06:41.263
[Zach] Yo! You only have to maintain
a C-minus average to play.

06:42.650 --> 06:44.470
Look at the tits on this cheerleader!

06:44.570 --> 06:45.685
[both laugh]

06:46.030 --> 06:47.179
Damn, didn't see that.

06:47.280 --> 06:50.909
Then we turn 18, and even though
we ’Ve never had an original thought;

06:50.990 --> 06:53.618
we have to make the most important
decision of our lives

06:56.240 --> 06:57.901
Ready to begin your future?

06:58.250 --> 07:00.741
Don't think I have much
of a choice in that one, really.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.627
How's your financial aid?

07:02.710 --> 07:03.836
How's your GPA?

07:04.630 --> 07:05.790
Could be better.

07:06.090 --> 07:07.910
PSAT? ACT?

07:08.420 --> 07:09.409
I haven't...

07:09.670 --> 07:12.173
You haven't taken your PSAT yet?

07:12.260 --> 07:13.249
No.

07:13.850 --> 07:14.669
Interesting.

07:15.140 --> 07:17.176
Well, I can tell you
that our financial aid

07:17.270 --> 07:19.306
tends to go to students
at the top of their class,

07:19.390 --> 07:21.051
with SATs above the 90th percentile.

07:21.850 --> 07:23.260
Great. Thanks.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.599
Of course.

07:25.190 --> 07:28.398
And if you don ’t have the money
and don ’1' really ha ve the grades,

07:28.490 --> 07:30.560
a lot of the decision gets made for you.

07:42.670 --> 07:44.206
What future are you peddling?

07:45.880 --> 07:47.336
I'll let you take the first guess.

07:47.880 --> 07:48.949
Hoarder?

07:49.800 --> 07:50.789
Close.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.006
Librarian.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.836
No way you're a librarian.

07:54.930 --> 07:55.919
I know.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.211
When people hear the term "librarian,"

07:58.310 --> 08:01.382
they think 60-year-old white-haired
woman with cankles.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.306
We are...

08:03.400 --> 08:04.640
rebranding.

08:04.900 --> 08:07.642
No offense, but isn't it
like a dying industry?

08:07.900 --> 08:11.529
You know, like travel agencies
and cupcake stores?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.191
Let me guess, you own a Kindle.

08:14.780 --> 08:16.407
Not in a million years.

08:16.490 --> 08:17.650
No, I'm a...

08:18.330 --> 08:21.322
paperback, write-in-the-margins
kind of girl.

08:21.410 --> 08:23.071
A kindred spirit.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.048
So, uh, other than
the Dewey Decimal System,

08:29.130 --> 08:31.121
what else has the library got going on?

08:31.300 --> 08:35.589
Well, I like to think we are a place
where people can come together,

08:35.680 --> 08:37.090
find their tribe.

08:37.760 --> 08:38.920
Do you write?

08:39.310 --> 08:40.709
You look like you write.

08:40.930 --> 08:41.919
I don't.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.808
I do, but... I don't show anybody. Ever.

08:49.270 --> 08:50.601
We've got a safe space.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.692
We keep secrets,

08:53.780 --> 08:55.850
and we have an
all-you-can-eat cookie platter.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.656
Well, thanks.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.991
I probably won't see you there,
but thanks.

09:04.330 --> 09:05.410
Sure thing.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.581
[Ryan] Just take a brochure.
They have scholarships.

09:08.790 --> 09:11.042
I don't need a brochure,
don't need your scholarship,

09:11.130 --> 09:13.257
and I don't need _
four years of wasted tIme.

09:13.340 --> 09:14.750
I have skills.

09:14.840 --> 09:15.920
And a sweet Mustang.

09:16.010 --> 09:16.999
Thank you.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.711
[Clay] So, are you kidnapping me?

09:21.970 --> 09:23.346
[Tony] Did you kidnap Courtney?

09:24.980 --> 09:26.299
I had a purpose.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.549
So do I.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.446
[Jessica] Alex.

09:36.070 --> 09:37.059
Are you okay?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.445
Yeah, yeah.

09:38.530 --> 09:39.610
Don't worry about it.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.156
It's all this shit with the tapes,
isn't it?

09:43.580 --> 09:46.117
If all that just went away, you'd be fine.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.326
Yeah, but how does all that just go away?

09:49.130 --> 09:50.620
What the hell, Jess? You coming or not?

09:50.710 --> 09:52.951
In a minute. I'm talking to Alex.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.369
Oh, about what?

09:54.460 --> 09:55.870
About how much she misses me.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.336
About how much better
of a boyfriend I am than you.

09:58.430 --> 10:00.421
How she wishes she never broke up with me.

10:00.510 --> 10:02.216
-How you smell bad.
-Alex, come on!

10:02.310 --> 10:04.050
-Fuck you, Alex.
-What? It's totally true.

10:04.140 --> 10:06.131
She was like, "Justin smells bad."
I was like, "I know."

10:06.230 --> 10:07.299
I did not say that.

10:07.390 --> 10:10.018
-You're a funny guy, Standall.
-No, you're funny, Justin.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.817
With the "Let's end the little bastard"?
What is that about?

10:12.900 --> 10:14.310
It's about protecting ourselves.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.277
-From what?
-From Hannah's lies.

10:16.360 --> 10:19.523
But did she lie?
'Cause I'm really not sure.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.235
'Cause she told the truth about me.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.076
You know he's full of shit, right?

10:29.540 --> 10:31.701
-He's a fucking liar.
-He's not a liar.

10:32.290 --> 10:34.588
He can be a pain in the ass,
but he's a good person.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.500
He's never lied to me.

10:38.760 --> 10:39.920
Well, good for him.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.306
[Hannah]
I wanted a purpose...

10:45.350 --> 10:47.261
a reason for being on this planet.

10:48.350 --> 10:51.183
But that poetry group
looked l/ke an AA meeting.

10:51.770 --> 10:53.601
Or a support group.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.897
I saw no one within decades of my age.

11:01.070 --> 11:02.776
Unt/lI saw you.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.486
You were the only other
high school kid in the room.

11:05.660 --> 11:07.400
Ryan Shaver,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.650
L/berty High is resident intellectual,

11:09.750 --> 11:11.820
editor of
Lost and Found,

11:11.920 --> 11:13.376
general selfish snob.

11:17.090 --> 11:18.079
[exhales]

11:18.170 --> 11:19.797
Welcome back, everybody.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.176
Good to see our group growing a bit.

11:23.010 --> 11:26.218
As usual, we begin by reminding everyone

11:26.310 --> 11:29.097
poetry is about honest expression.

11:29.350 --> 11:33.013
And we all need to feel safe
to share our deepest truths.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.101
Nice to see a friendly face.

11:35.940 --> 11:36.929
Friendly?

11:37.230 --> 11:38.219
Familiar?

11:38.320 --> 11:40.356
The sign-up sheet
is making its way around.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.810
Well, don't get used to it.

11:43.820 --> 11:46.823
I think it's gonna be my first and
last time if you're going to be here.

11:46.910 --> 11:47.899
What? Why?

11:47.990 --> 11:51.289
Please only sign up for slots
you'll actually use.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.359
You put me in your little zine?

11:54.250 --> 11:55.285
Remember?

11:55.420 --> 11:56.535
"Best ass."

11:57.050 --> 11:58.665
That list was already going around.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.461
Everyone was talking about it.

12:01.090 --> 12:02.079
It was news.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.579
It was wrong.

12:03.840 --> 12:07.844
Now then, before we begin, Hannah,
would you like to introduce yourself?

12:11.140 --> 12:12.630
Hi, I'm Hannah.

12:12.850 --> 12:14.260
[all] Hi, Hannah.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.766
I don't know a lot about poetry,

12:16.860 --> 12:18.976
but I'm very happy to be here.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.351
We're very happy to have you here.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.656
Let's begin.

12:23.740 --> 12:27.232
I believe Linda
is first on the sign-up list.

12:37.170 --> 12:38.489
O!

12:38.590 --> 12:40.626
A woman scorned

12:40.710 --> 12:41.790
Mother Earth

12:42.550 --> 12:43.869
O!

12:43.970 --> 12:46.882
All may feel your wrath

12:47.180 --> 12:49.967
Majesty of Mother Earth. . .

12:50.770 --> 12:54.183
[Clay] Is this like your idea of some
twisted version of wilderness therapy?

12:56.440 --> 12:58.010
Not a nature lover?

12:58.110 --> 13:00.817
I love nature,
especially in pictures in books.

13:02.400 --> 13:03.526
What's with the rope?

13:04.110 --> 13:06.101
No, seriously, this is getting messed up.

13:10.330 --> 13:12.036
So what, are you gonna tie me up to a tree

13:12.120 --> 13:14.361
and force me to listen
to the rest of the tapes?

13:14.790 --> 13:16.610
No, we're just going for a little walk.

13:18.250 --> 13:19.660
How little is little?

13:22.920 --> 13:24.217
Just up that hill.

13:28.430 --> 13:30.716
[Clay] No freaking way.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.380
What the hell does this
have to do with Hannah?

13:34.890 --> 13:36.266
Don't you want to find out?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.397
[Hannah] ”
0, tall mountains

13:43.480 --> 13:46.313
and Mother Earth"
and all this other hooey.

13:46.570 --> 13:48.356
I don't think I'm going back.

13:48.570 --> 13:51.698
Well, I think it's fine
if you don't want to,

13:51.780 --> 13:54.408
but maybe you should give it a chance.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.617
You said you thought
about a career as a writer.

13:57.710 --> 13:59.871
Yeah, but no one has a career as a poet.

13:59.960 --> 14:03.498
Damn it! If you could remind me to tell
your father to call the alarm company.

14:03.590 --> 14:05.330
I think this thing's broken.

14:05.420 --> 14:06.751
Let me try.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.710
You finish the deposit.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.085
Well, how about uh...

14:10.550 --> 14:12.256
what about a poetry teacher?

14:12.680 --> 14:14.966
Who would want to be a teacher?
Kids are assholes.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.469
Not all of them.

14:17.060 --> 14:19.142
Okay, what about a journalist then?

14:19.230 --> 14:20.766
Do those still exist?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.259
Tell Dad this is broken.

14:23.480 --> 14:24.777
You're a parent.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.851
You're supposed to say things like,

14:26.940 --> 14:29.773
"Be practical, be a pharmacist."

14:31.120 --> 14:32.940
I will never say that to you.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.787
You know, before we opened this store,
your father,

14:37.870 --> 14:39.781
he used to travel all the time

14:39.870 --> 14:43.419
for these snooze-fest
pharmaceutical conventions.

14:43.500 --> 14:47.084
So, I would write him love stories.

14:48.130 --> 14:51.543
Mm-hmm. They were very, very dramatic...

14:52.390 --> 14:54.460
and sexy.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.346
Fifty shades of my mother?

14:56.430 --> 14:57.419
[laughs]

14:57.520 --> 14:59.806
I thought they were pretty good,
you know.

15:01.310 --> 15:03.392
I don't know, I might have some of them.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.311
-I could find them.
-Oh, God, Mom, please no.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.027
Okay, listen to me.

15:07.110 --> 15:08.395
I'm just saying...

15:09.530 --> 15:10.940
allow yourself...

15:11.450 --> 15:12.860
to dream a little.

15:13.530 --> 15:15.907
I mean, hell, dream big.

15:16.990 --> 15:18.446
About all the things that...

15:19.540 --> 15:20.495
you could be.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.876
Don't settle.

15:25.460 --> 15:26.370
Mmm?

15:27.380 --> 15:28.586
[door opens]

15:30.340 --> 15:32.296
-We're closed. Go away.
-Hannah!

15:32.640 --> 15:34.505
Mom, he's not a customer.

15:35.890 --> 15:38.017
Oh. Oh, I see.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.635
I'm gonna go get my coat.

15:41.730 --> 15:42.719
Um...

15:43.770 --> 15:45.431
It's in the back, so...

15:47.940 --> 15:50.647
What do you want, Ryan?
We're legitimately closed.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.026
I have something for you.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.309
A peace offering.

16:00.580 --> 16:01.899
Take it.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.627
Your thoughts deserve
a decent place to live.

16:06.170 --> 16:08.411
Come on, I know you're a journal girl.

16:12.800 --> 16:13.880
Wow.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.963
You do a really convincing imitation
of a thinking, feeling human.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.475
Hannah".

16:24.730 --> 16:25.799
I'm sorry.

16:26.810 --> 16:29.813
I didn't mean to make you
feel embarrassed or humiliated.

16:30.570 --> 16:31.776
I know what that's like.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.446
You do?

16:34.450 --> 16:38.409
I'm a skinny faggot who writes poems.
I mean, please. [chuckles]

16:39.450 --> 16:41.532
I don't think you're supposed
to use that word.

16:41.620 --> 16:43.781
Mmm. You're not. I'm allowed.

16:45.830 --> 16:48.458
Just come back to the library, Hannah.

16:49.210 --> 16:50.757
Come back to the poetry.

16:52.920 --> 16:53.921
Maybe.

16:55.220 --> 16:56.209
I'll take maybe.

17:00.260 --> 17:01.841
Thanks... for the journal.

17:17.030 --> 17:18.156
[Mr. Baker]
Honey?

17:19.160 --> 17:20.149
Honey?

17:22.450 --> 17:23.439
You okay?

17:27.580 --> 17:30.959
I was just thinking
it's a bad sign that we're...

17:31.050 --> 17:34.042
running out of
"Buy One, Get One Free" stickers.

17:35.470 --> 17:39.133
We can look at it as a bad sign or
we can consider it the world telling us

17:39.220 --> 17:41.848
we can never discount our way
to Walplex prices.

17:48.190 --> 17:50.146
I've got more stickers
back here somewhere.

17:55.780 --> 17:56.895
[door opens]

17:59.700 --> 18:01.110
Oh, Olivia.

18:02.490 --> 18:03.479
Olivia.

18:05.290 --> 18:07.497
I'm so sorry I didn't come in sooner.

18:09.170 --> 18:10.376
How are you holding up?

18:11.630 --> 18:12.995
Um...

18:13.090 --> 18:14.296
We're managing.

18:16.510 --> 18:17.579
You look great.

18:19.930 --> 18:23.218
Oh, Olivia,
Hannah was such a special girl.

18:24.100 --> 18:27.228
Zach said so many nice things about her.

18:28.940 --> 18:30.305
How is Zach?

18:31.110 --> 18:33.101
Well, he's just great.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.317
Every college is looking at him
for basketball, but...

18:37.530 --> 18:40.237
he wants to be a marine biologist.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.618
Can you believe it? A marine biologist.

18:46.330 --> 18:47.820
A marine biologist.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.740
[Mr. Porter]
I wonder if you ’ve been
th/nk/ng about your future.

18:52.710 --> 18:56.089
You know,
your grades have been slipping a bit.

18:57.260 --> 19:00.252
You started out the school year
really strong...

19:01.140 --> 19:03.597
but your grades have steadily dropped.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.558
I would really focus
on ending the school year strong...

19:07.560 --> 19:10.347
if you have your eyes
on a good four-year college.

19:10.980 --> 19:13.107
I've been thinking about NYU or Columbia.

19:13.190 --> 19:16.023
Wow, those are some
highly competitive schools.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.693
So, either you're going to have to
make some changes next year, or...

19:19.780 --> 19:21.350
maybe think smaller.

19:21.950 --> 19:23.360
Maybe like a state school.

19:26.990 --> 19:29.367
[Lain/e]
You never met with Hannah?

19:31.580 --> 19:36.119
Once, in the spring
of her sophomore year last year.

19:37.130 --> 19:39.792
We start the sophomores
thinking of college.

19:40.470 --> 19:44.179
And do you recall what
she was thinking of college?

19:44.600 --> 19:48.013
I think if memory serves,
she had some unrealistic goals.

19:49.020 --> 19:52.399
And I tried to help her find some options.

19:53.060 --> 19:56.814
Did you have a sense of how she felt
about your interaction?

19:58.190 --> 19:59.566
She didn't say.

19:59.650 --> 20:01.527
But did you have a sense?

20:02.030 --> 20:03.019
Mrs. Jensen.

20:03.110 --> 20:04.111
-Lainie.
-LaIn|e.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.269
Please.

20:07.620 --> 20:10.248
I know this is not the subject
of our meeting,

20:10.330 --> 20:12.821
but do you know
where your son is right now?

20:14.580 --> 20:16.207
I assume he's in class.

20:16.290 --> 20:17.416
He isn't.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.207
He walked out of school this morning
and hasn't come back.

20:21.630 --> 20:24.258
[Clay]
I may be crazy,
but I am not that crazy.

20:24.340 --> 20:26.046
People free solo it all the time.

20:26.140 --> 20:28.131
People who climb things,

20:28.220 --> 20:29.380
people who climb rocks...

20:29.470 --> 20:32.268
which is a ridiculous thing to do
if you aren't being chased by something.

20:32.390 --> 20:33.800
It's for beginners.

20:33.890 --> 20:36.142
I used to climb it with my brothers
when we were kids.

20:37.060 --> 20:38.061
Here.

20:38.150 --> 20:39.435
Take this, clip it on.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.145
It's chalk.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.105
Put it on your hands, like this.

20:44.700 --> 20:45.689
Or you'll slip.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.366
What?

20:48.450 --> 20:50.281
Come on, are you a man or not?

20:50.370 --> 20:51.246
Not!

20:51.750 --> 20:55.117
Most definitely not.
I grant you that, no question.

20:56.880 --> 20:57.869
I, uh...

20:59.250 --> 21:00.456
I don't like heights.

21:01.670 --> 21:03.467
[Tony] It's an easy climb.

21:03.550 --> 21:06.292
All the answers you seek
are at the top of the cliff.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.017
[Ryan] The drag of your hand
across my chest

21:16.100 --> 21:18.307
Sparks a blaze
my lips cannot extinguish

21:19.320 --> 21:22.141
You, stubborn inferno

21:22.740 --> 21:26.528
You drive fast, and damn
the red lights for slowing you down

21:27.110 --> 21:30.614
You see my veins shake
at your first touch

21:31.200 --> 21:34.829
The power to move my blood
on your own accord

21:34.910 --> 21:36.992
The definition of heart

21:37.580 --> 21:39.662
And after the stick shift jerk

21:39.750 --> 21:41.490
I beg my skin to do tricks

21:41.590 --> 21:44.127
Like forget how good it feels
to lose control

21:44.220 --> 21:46.427
Between the burning house

21:46.510 --> 21:47.795
Of your hands

21:50.350 --> 21:51.999
[applause]

21:56.810 --> 21:57.799
Whoo!

22:04.780 --> 22:05.599
Hey.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.735
That was...

22:08.530 --> 22:09.815
intense.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.531
Um... Thank you?

22:12.910 --> 22:14.036
Yes, thank you.

22:14.580 --> 22:15.956
I want to write like you.

22:16.540 --> 22:18.917
Seriously, can you teach me?

22:19.170 --> 22:20.159
Really?

22:20.960 --> 22:23.121
You make people feel
the things you're feeling.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.910
I want to be able to do that.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.297
A couple of hours
a couple of nights a week.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.927
Chips and salsa on me.

22:31.970 --> 22:33.961
"Stephie Moore is mean.

22:34.060 --> 22:35.300
She..."

22:35.390 --> 22:36.379
Sic.

22:36.770 --> 22:38.681
"She so stupid."

22:38.770 --> 22:40.146
Third grade!

22:40.650 --> 22:42.106
I was in third grade!

22:43.320 --> 22:45.891
Don't get what my grade school diaries
have to do with anything.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.059
Well...

22:47.190 --> 22:50.774
First, there's a bunch of
gifted child drama I won't get into.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.283
The main thing is,
you have to tell the truth in poetry.

22:54.580 --> 22:55.569
Your truth.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.444
-But--
-No buts.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.747
EX n/h/lo n/h/l ﬁt.

23:00.330 --> 23:02.412
"Out of nothing comes nothing."

23:04.420 --> 23:08.083
I just don't like it when people
read my... things.

23:08.670 --> 23:11.582
Every poem you write should be like
someone reading your things.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.843
It should be terrifying
and incredibly embarrassing.

23:18.100 --> 23:20.591
"How does Amber Holloway
have boobs already?"

23:21.350 --> 23:22.476
You're an asshole!

23:22.560 --> 23:23.891
Yes! Yes!

23:23.980 --> 23:25.106
Be terrified.

23:26.110 --> 23:27.270
[grunts]

23:28.820 --> 23:30.139
Good.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.151
Now try and slow your breath down.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.321
How do I do that?

23:34.910 --> 23:36.070
By breathing slower.

23:36.160 --> 23:39.652
What do I do about my heart,
which is about to explode out of my chest?

23:39.750 --> 23:40.614
[cell phone rings]

23:42.370 --> 23:43.371
Shit.

23:43.460 --> 23:44.996
You brought your phone on a climb?

23:45.960 --> 23:47.791
No, I brought my phone on a walk.

23:47.880 --> 23:49.507
That's my mom's ring.

23:50.880 --> 23:54.338
Be a good son
or plunge to the rocks below.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.597
Yeah. Thanks for the perspective.

23:56.850 --> 23:57.839
[ringing continues]

23:57.930 --> 24:00.012
[Hannah]
It must be poss/b/e
to swim in the ocean

24:00.100 --> 24:01.761
of the one you love without drowning.

24:02.690 --> 24:05.762
It must be poss/b/e to swim
without becoming water yourself

24:07.270 --> 24:09.647
I keep finding stones tied to my feet.

24:10.860 --> 24:11.940
Sorry, I just...

24:12.030 --> 24:13.520
Just keep going, keep going.

24:17.580 --> 24:19.036
-Jess, I...
-What?

24:19.120 --> 24:20.576
-WIhat?

24:20.660 --> 24:21.866
I-I can't right now.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.166
No, no, it's okay.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.035
Maybe if I helped a little?

24:25.130 --> 24:27.200
Oh, Jess, come on, look. I just...

24:29.090 --> 24:31.411
Maybe later.
I just don't want to right now.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.210
I don't do it for you anymore.

24:39.890 --> 24:41.630
-That's not it.
-It has to be.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.261
You don't think I'm pretty anymore.

24:46.480 --> 24:47.515
Jess.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.639
God, no, Jess.

24:50.730 --> 24:52.186
You're so beautiful.

24:54.110 --> 24:55.691
What's happening to us?

24:58.160 --> 24:59.400
It'll all be fine, okay?

25:01.040 --> 25:03.326
Once these stupid
fucking tapes are done.

25:06.540 --> 25:07.916
Can we at least get high?

25:11.170 --> 25:13.468
-You don't even smoke.
-Yeah, I do.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.129
Okay.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.715
[C/ay]
We are really freaking h/gh.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.300
Don't think about it.

25:21.390 --> 25:23.176
Chalk your hands if they're sweaty.

25:24.480 --> 25:25.936
I can't really feel my arms.

25:26.020 --> 25:28.011
You gotta shake 'em out, one at a time.

25:28.110 --> 25:29.816
Get the blood moving, all right?

25:29.900 --> 25:31.856
[Clay panting] Whoo!

25:31.940 --> 25:33.487
Good. Good.

25:33.820 --> 25:35.060
We're getting closer.

25:35.150 --> 25:37.983
Remember, you gotta go slow
if you want to climb fast.

25:39.870 --> 25:40.939
All right.

25:45.160 --> 25:47.242
-Oh, shit!
-Ow! Gah!

25:47.330 --> 25:48.319
Shit!

25:48.420 --> 25:49.580
Oh, shit!

25:49.920 --> 25:51.126
What? What? I can't see!

25:51.210 --> 25:52.290
I lost a handhold.

25:52.880 --> 25:54.757
Give me a sec,
I've got to figure this out.

25:56.220 --> 25:57.289
[banging at door]

25:57.380 --> 25:59.541
[Lainie] Clay! Clay, are you here?

25:59.640 --> 26:00.709
Lainie?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.841
He's not here. He isn't here.

26:04.180 --> 26:06.262
Okay. Okay, calm down. What's going on?

26:06.350 --> 26:08.227
I left you a detailed message.

26:08.310 --> 26:09.550
The department secretary is 90.

26:09.650 --> 26:11.936
He walked out of school and disappeared.

26:12.020 --> 26:13.601
I'm sure he didn't disappear.

26:13.690 --> 26:15.681
He is not answering his cell, Matt.

26:15.940 --> 26:18.773
So he skipped school
to play basketball or go for a ride.

26:18.860 --> 26:19.906
He's missing, Matt!

26:19.990 --> 26:22.117
He's playing hooky. He's not missing.

26:22.200 --> 26:24.156
If you minimize this, I will lose it.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.366
Okay, okay.

26:25.660 --> 26:26.786
We'll find him.

26:27.500 --> 26:28.910
He can't have gone far.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.831
All right, I'm gonna throw this.
Grab it, pull yourself up.

26:40.090 --> 26:41.842
-Tony, I can't.
-Of course you can.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.465
One foot at a time.

26:43.760 --> 26:44.761
Come on.

26:45.310 --> 26:46.345
Oh...

26:48.520 --> 26:51.853
-Whoa! Ah! Okay.
-All right, you got it.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.470
There you go. [laughs]

26:55.570 --> 26:57.356
-There you go!
-[grunting]

26:59.780 --> 27:01.190
-[C|ay gasps]
-There you go!

27:01.700 --> 27:02.735
Oh, shit!

27:03.240 --> 27:04.275
Oh, man!

27:06.410 --> 27:08.071
Whoa! That was freaking amazing.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.320
Was it? Or was it fucking amazing?

27:11.330 --> 27:14.333
That was fucking amazing.

27:15.090 --> 27:16.626
Like... I thought I was gonna die!

27:17.010 --> 27:18.375
But you didn't, did you?

27:19.800 --> 27:20.789
Fuck!

27:23.600 --> 27:24.919
Fuck!

27:26.140 --> 27:28.722
Fuck!

27:29.310 --> 27:30.379
Yeah.

27:31.230 --> 27:32.936
I saw this YouTube video once

27:33.020 --> 27:35.147
where this guy in Spain
was walking on this crane.

27:35.230 --> 27:36.970
He had to be at least 15 stories.

27:37.070 --> 27:38.981
He's walking, walking, walking.

27:39.570 --> 27:42.482
And then he slips.
He lets out this loud scream.

27:42.570 --> 27:43.776
Seconds later, wham!

27:44.160 --> 27:45.195
Wham what?

27:46.990 --> 27:49.447
The camera went black,
but I'm pretty sure he died.

27:49.870 --> 27:50.780
Shit, Clay.

27:52.290 --> 27:53.245
Fuck.

27:56.670 --> 27:59.719
I never totally realized,
that's a really great word.

28:00.300 --> 28:01.335
It is, huh?

28:02.010 --> 28:02.829
Uh...

28:03.260 --> 28:04.249
You're bleeding.

28:08.270 --> 28:09.305
Fuck.

28:09.470 --> 28:10.971
[Hannah]
Wow, this is scary.
[chuckles]

28:16.610 --> 28:18.771
Today I am wearing lacy black underwear

28:19.780 --> 28:22.396
For the sole purpose of knowing
I am wearing them

28:24.820 --> 28:25.980
And underneath that

28:27.740 --> 28:30.152
I am absolutely naked

28:32.580 --> 28:33.786
And I've got skin

28:34.880 --> 28:37.531
Miles and miles of skin

28:39.420 --> 28:42.162
I've got skin to cover all my thoughts
like Saran Wrap

28:42.720 --> 28:43.675
That you can see through

28:43.760 --> 28:46.137
to what leftovers are inside
from the night before

28:47.930 --> 28:49.670
And despite what you might think

28:50.140 --> 28:51.676
My skin is soft

28:52.390 --> 28:53.379
And smooth

28:54.850 --> 28:55.976
And easily scarred

28:58.940 --> 29:00.771
But that doesn't matter, right?

29:01.440 --> 29:03.772
You don't care about how soft my skin is

29:04.910 --> 29:07.697
You just want to hear
about what my fingers do in the dark

29:09.870 --> 29:12.282
But what if all they do
is crack open windows

29:12.370 --> 29:14.611
So I can see
lightning through the clouds?

29:16.750 --> 29:19.127
What if all they crave
is a jungle gym to climb

29:19.210 --> 29:21.417
For a taste of fresher air?

29:23.760 --> 29:24.920
I C/ay]
You promised me

29:25.010 --> 29:26.966
the secrets are at the top of this rock.

29:27.050 --> 29:29.462
-I risked my life to get here.
-You wouldn't have died.

29:30.510 --> 29:31.966
You'd break a bunch of shit.

29:32.470 --> 29:33.676
[scoffs]

29:41.820 --> 29:43.185
I never thought about it.

29:44.990 --> 29:45.979
Dying.

29:47.450 --> 29:48.565
Until this year.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.576
Have you ever seen a dead body?

30:00.630 --> 30:02.291
I've been to a few funerals.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.375
Have you ever seen a crime scene?

30:08.550 --> 30:09.539
Well, like...

30:11.310 --> 30:12.754
CSI
and
Law & Order,
all that.

30:12.850 --> 30:14.420
No, no. Like a...

30:15.600 --> 30:16.760
a real one.

30:19.810 --> 30:20.765
Have you?

30:21.860 --> 30:22.815
Yeah.

30:23.110 --> 30:24.020
Once.

30:27.820 --> 30:29.026
What was that like?

30:31.070 --> 30:32.116
Quiet.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.957
Not silent or anything, just...

30:37.830 --> 30:38.865
no excitement.

30:39.420 --> 30:42.036
No big noise.

30:42.210 --> 30:45.122
Just cops walking around doing their jobs.

30:46.720 --> 30:47.789
Like it was nothin'.

30:50.720 --> 30:51.789
How old were you?

30:52.550 --> 30:53.551
Seventeen.

30:57.140 --> 30:58.630
What was the crime?

31:02.980 --> 31:04.015
Suicide.

31:12.570 --> 31:13.650
You were there.

31:17.370 --> 31:18.280
You saw her.

31:22.960 --> 31:24.029
You should publish this.

31:24.380 --> 31:27.258
Oh, no. No way.
This does not leave the safe space.

31:27.340 --> 31:29.752
People need to see this.
It will change them.

31:30.340 --> 31:31.329
No, they don't.

31:33.890 --> 31:37.519
The whole point of creative expression
is to hold up a mirror to the world

31:37.600 --> 31:41.263
so hopefully these god-awful people
can start to see themselves

31:41.350 --> 31:45.013
and make connections to help them
get through their dreary-ass lives.

31:46.270 --> 31:47.430
Your pain...

31:48.690 --> 31:51.067
your pain is important to other people.

31:56.450 --> 31:58.281
[Hannah]
But is that why you really did it?

31:59.080 --> 32:00.365
[students laughing]

32:02.370 --> 32:04.838
So you could help me
touch just one person?

32:05.920 --> 32:06.909
What?

32:07.000 --> 32:08.080
I doubt it.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.292
People l/ke you don ’1' make selﬂess moves.

32:11.380 --> 32:14.543
Oh, my God, dude, this shit is crazy!

32:16.140 --> 32:19.428
"Today I am wearing lacy black underwear

32:19.520 --> 32:22.341
with the sole purpose of knowing
that I am wearing it."

32:22.440 --> 32:26.604
-I wonder who's the skank who wrote this!
-I don't even know what this means.

32:26.690 --> 32:28.646
It's a bitch who's been burned,
I know that.

32:29.230 --> 32:31.812
You knew the shit
I shared was personal.

32:31.900 --> 32:35.233
You knew where it came from,
and that it would get people talking.

32:36.660 --> 32:39.481
I realize now I was desperate
for someone to listen...

32:40.910 --> 32:42.116
and you listened.

32:43.540 --> 32:47.203
And then you made my most
private thoughts a public spectacle.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.587
[bell rings]

32:54.130 --> 32:55.506
[Jessica] It's her writing.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.216
I can totally recognize it.

32:57.970 --> 33:00.177
[Courtney] Why would she write
something like this?

33:00.270 --> 33:01.510
So humiliating.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.591
[teacher] It has been
brought to my attention

33:04.690 --> 33:07.727
that Ryan's publication
now includes poetry.

33:07.900 --> 33:10.027
And since we're doing sonnets
this semester,

33:10.110 --> 33:13.523
and since you're all going to be
distracted by it anyway,

33:13.610 --> 33:17.569
I thought we would take a minute
to parse the work of this poet.

33:17.950 --> 33:19.690
-[coughs] Hannah.
-[class chuckling]

33:19.780 --> 33:22.783
[teacher] There's a sort of naked
vulnerability to it that I like.

33:22.870 --> 33:23.996
It's quite intimate.

33:24.410 --> 33:25.320
[all laugh]

33:25.870 --> 33:27.622
"Intimate" is not a dirty word.

33:30.250 --> 33:33.003
"Today I am wearing lacy black underwear

33:33.090 --> 33:34.967
for the sole purpose of knowing..."

33:35.260 --> 33:39.344
So you bear your heart to one person
and everybody ends up laughing.

33:41.060 --> 33:44.803
"I've got skin, miles and miles of skin.

33:45.190 --> 33:49.183
I've got skin to cover all my thoughts
like Saran Wrap."

33:49.810 --> 33:51.641
[Tony]
I can see her through the window.

33:53.820 --> 33:56.027
She walks up to the door,
she leaves this box.

33:56.820 --> 33:57.980
And goes.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.069
I didn't get up.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.321
I figured if it was important,
she would have knocked.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.326
Rang the doorbell or something, right?

34:10.540 --> 34:11.700
And I...

34:14.420 --> 34:16.047
I should have gone out there.

34:17.630 --> 34:19.211
I should have talked to her.

34:20.220 --> 34:21.255
But...

34:23.640 --> 34:25.050
Look, I liked Hannah.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.549
She was a friend.

34:27.640 --> 34:29.688
But the girl was a lot.
She was drama.

34:31.230 --> 34:34.438
And I
was
apparently
the only guy at Liberty

34:34.530 --> 34:37.522
who didn't grab her ass
or stare at her tits.

34:38.240 --> 34:40.231
And so I always got to hear about it...

34:40.820 --> 34:42.822
and on that particular day,
I didn't want to deal,

34:42.910 --> 34:44.366
so I let her walk away.

34:48.160 --> 34:49.286
Jesus, Tony.

34:52.130 --> 34:53.165
Half hour...

34:53.670 --> 34:55.376
forty-five minutes later,

34:55.460 --> 34:58.372
I get the box, open 'em,
and there's these tapes,

34:58.470 --> 34:59.676
and a letter.

35:02.470 --> 35:05.928
"Please take care of these.
Listen, and you'll know how."

35:08.270 --> 35:10.261
I started listening to the first tape.

35:10.900 --> 35:11.935
And then...

35:14.690 --> 35:18.239
I try calling the Bakers.
They don't answer. I speed to her house.

35:20.990 --> 35:22.560
The ambulance is already there.

35:24.030 --> 35:25.156
And the cops.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.457
And the front door's open.
I run inside.

35:30.290 --> 35:31.951
Her parents are there.

35:32.960 --> 35:33.995
And she's...

35:36.710 --> 35:38.200
They've got her in a body bag.

35:40.510 --> 35:43.343
I remember thinking,
"There's no handles on that bag-

35:43.430 --> 35:46.638
How are they gonna pick her up?
How are they gonna carry her?"

35:48.520 --> 35:50.385
And they just grabbed the bag...

35:51.190 --> 35:53.306
and threw her in the ambulance.

35:55.730 --> 35:56.719
Just like that.

36:07.910 --> 36:09.150
[Clay sniffling]

36:21.170 --> 36:22.376
Do the other kids know?

36:26.430 --> 36:29.137
Why you're taking care of Hannah
like you are?

36:31.180 --> 36:32.260
Of course not.

36:34.020 --> 36:35.180
You needed to know.

36:38.780 --> 36:39.974
You're my friend.

36:47.490 --> 36:48.570
What the hell, Ryan?

36:48.660 --> 36:52.118
Hannah. What's so secret
you couldn't speak to me at school?

36:52.250 --> 36:54.457
You know damn well.
How could you do that to me?

36:55.080 --> 36:56.286
The poem?

36:56.380 --> 36:59.452
I did you a favor, Hannah.
You're a beautiful poet.

36:59.630 --> 37:01.166
Your work deserved to be heard.

37:01.510 --> 37:04.252
You're a self-serving,
egotistical fuckwad.

37:04.340 --> 37:05.329
[scoffs]

37:05.680 --> 37:06.795
One day...

37:07.760 --> 37:10.001
you will look back on this
and know that I was right.

37:10.850 --> 37:14.229
What you wrote, you can't teach that.
You have to live it.

37:14.310 --> 37:16.722
Well, it's my life, Ryan, it's not yours.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.389
Get your own.

37:22.070 --> 37:24.026
There was a path the whole time?

37:24.860 --> 37:26.737
We could have just walked up there?

37:26.820 --> 37:29.152
Yes. But what's the fun in that?

37:30.240 --> 37:32.492
Everything you told me,
you could have told me anywhere.

37:32.950 --> 37:34.247
In Monet's the other night.

37:34.330 --> 37:36.286
Would you have been ready to hear it?

37:37.290 --> 37:38.279
Yeah.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.449
No. I don't know.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.250
I wish I had known, though.

37:50.010 --> 37:51.966
Why you cared so much about Hannah.

37:53.430 --> 37:55.057
I kept trying to figure it out.

37:58.650 --> 37:59.639
I thought maybe...

38:01.730 --> 38:03.937
I thought maybe you were in love with her.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.559
Clay...

38:07.660 --> 38:09.059
you know I'm gay, right?

38:13.660 --> 38:14.649
What?

38:17.670 --> 38:20.491
No, I didn't know that.
How was I supposed to know that?

38:21.670 --> 38:23.080
I thought everyone knew it.

38:25.260 --> 38:26.830
I don't think everyone knows.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.124
A lot of people know it.

38:30.430 --> 38:31.840
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:31.930 --> 38:33.886
Did you think that I was, like...

38:34.890 --> 38:36.175
just friends with Ryan?

38:37.940 --> 38:39.589
Well, yeah, I guess so.

38:42.860 --> 38:46.398
You think I would be friends
with a guy like Ryan.

38:47.490 --> 38:50.698
Yeah, would think you would be
'cause apparently you went out.

38:50.780 --> 38:53.362
They're different things. Trust me.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.456
So that guy Brad...

38:59.540 --> 39:01.622
is he your boyfriend now?

39:01.710 --> 39:03.621
I hope he's still my boyfriend.

39:03.710 --> 39:06.338
He's been pretty annoyed lately because...

39:07.510 --> 39:10.081
I've been spending all my time
with another guy.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.096
You.

39:15.560 --> 39:16.458
Oh.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.424
Right.

39:19.310 --> 39:22.393
You mean with the tapes and all,
not in a romantic way.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.309
Sure.

39:30.150 --> 39:31.356
[Alex]
A/eX Standall.

39:31.450 --> 39:34.078
S-T-A-N-D-A-L-L.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.322
Yes. It's filled. Ready to go.

39:38.750 --> 39:42.163
Okay, with this, you want to take one
every night before bed,

39:42.250 --> 39:44.081
with water, with or without food.

39:44.210 --> 39:45.541
This one can make you dizzy--

39:45.630 --> 39:47.837
I know. I've been taking it
for a while now.

39:48.510 --> 39:49.465
Oh.

39:49.550 --> 39:50.835
We have this as new.

39:50.970 --> 39:52.506
I used to go to Walplex.

39:54.180 --> 39:57.263
I could have them send
your history over, if you like.

39:57.350 --> 39:59.136
Yeah, that'd be great, thank you.

40:08.570 --> 40:10.276
-There you go.
-Thanks.

40:15.200 --> 40:16.235
I, uh...

40:17.450 --> 40:18.781
I was friends with Hannah.

40:21.830 --> 40:23.115
You were?

40:23.370 --> 40:25.076
Yeah. Um...

40:25.170 --> 40:27.126
I'm really sorry about what happened.

40:30.550 --> 40:31.619
Thank you, Alex.

40:32.590 --> 40:33.579
Yeah.

40:43.810 --> 40:44.720
Thank you.

41:07.540 --> 41:09.952
Apparently your mom called my dad.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.080
Oh, Jesus.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.967
My mom. I'll text her.

41:14.050 --> 41:17.884
We do not need that particular
hysterical phone call at this moment.

41:17.970 --> 41:20.552
Maybe if you didn't keep all those
secrets from her--

41:20.640 --> 41:22.676
Oh, fuck you, with your secrets.

41:24.980 --> 41:25.969
[engine starts]

41:26.060 --> 41:27.106
Could I, uh...

41:29.400 --> 41:31.140
Could I get those tapes back sometime?

41:39.240 --> 41:40.229
Sure thing.

41:48.250 --> 41:50.741
So, what, was this your plan
the whole time?

41:50.920 --> 41:52.876
Maybe I helped it along, but...

41:52.960 --> 41:55.508
I knew sooner or later
you'd want the tapes back.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.079
-You knew?
-Yeah.

41:59.890 --> 42:01.300
You haven't heard yours yet.

42:13.610 --> 42:14.679
It's delicious, but...

42:15.320 --> 42:16.605
not another bite.

42:20.370 --> 42:21.359
Thank you.

42:23.450 --> 42:24.906
This was a good idea.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.206
[girl giggles]

42:32.420 --> 42:33.910
[chuckles] Oh.

42:34.710 --> 42:36.337
Honey, you can't do that.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.080
I'm so sorry.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.579
-Oh, no.
-She's totally fine.

42:39.720 --> 42:41.927
He was due for a new hairstyle anyway.

42:43.600 --> 42:44.589
What's your name?

42:45.730 --> 42:47.937
It's okay, sweetie. You can tell her.

42:48.020 --> 42:49.009
Sarah.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.089
Sarah.

42:50.610 --> 42:52.009
You're very cute, Sarah.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.969
Say thank you, Sarah.

42:54.070 --> 42:55.105
No.

42:55.740 --> 42:58.231
Sarah. That's not nice.

42:58.570 --> 43:01.403
Oh, please, don't worry about it.
I have a daughter too.

43:01.530 --> 43:04.442
No wonder you're such a pro.
How old is she?

43:05.040 --> 43:07.201
-Seventeen.
-Seventeen.

43:07.330 --> 43:08.911
Yeah, it flies by.

43:09.000 --> 43:12.834
Before you know it,
she'll be applying for colleges.

43:14.380 --> 43:16.166
Hannah's already looking.

43:17.050 --> 43:18.665
Hannah's such a pretty name.

43:20.340 --> 43:21.716
She wants to go to New York.

43:24.060 --> 43:25.004
Good luck.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.510
[mother] Let's go back to dinner.

43:28.180 --> 43:30.011
[Lainie]
It’s a horr/b/e story, Matt.

43:30.520 --> 43:32.181
She was a beautiful...

43:33.270 --> 43:35.522
sweet girl, and she's gone.

43:36.780 --> 43:39.271
Of course, we're supposed
to tear her apart.

43:40.990 --> 43:43.618
Go after her reputation, her boyfriends,

43:43.780 --> 43:45.782
anything she's ever written or said.

43:45.870 --> 43:48.247
So don't do it. Don't go after her.

43:49.660 --> 43:51.491
You always said that's why you did law.

43:51.580 --> 43:54.242
If it didn't always serve justice,
it could serve the truth.

43:55.210 --> 43:56.199
Right?

43:56.880 --> 43:58.120
So find out the truth.

44:00.420 --> 44:02.001
What if it hurts our son?

44:03.010 --> 44:04.841
I believe he'll survive.

44:05.260 --> 44:06.466
[car approaches]

44:08.220 --> 44:09.847
The traveler returns.

44:12.810 --> 44:15.017
You think that Tony's a good influence?

44:16.440 --> 44:19.068
My sense of him is
that he's a very good influence.

44:19.900 --> 44:21.811
But that's not our concern
at the moment, right?

44:21.900 --> 44:23.561
Nope. I know.

44:24.490 --> 44:25.696
I am on board.

44:27.290 --> 44:28.359
[door opens]

44:40.210 --> 44:41.370
I'm sorry.

44:41.470 --> 44:42.505
I'm...

44:43.840 --> 44:44.886
really.

44:46.640 --> 44:49.848
Tony and I had to talk,
and we lost track of time.

44:50.850 --> 44:54.399
And I_know this was
really not like me, believe me.

44:54.480 --> 44:56.300
And I'm sorry.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.237
Oh, God, I must be in huge trouble.

45:05.200 --> 45:08.772
But next time, a text would be
appreciated before you go,

45:08.870 --> 45:10.576
and not on the way home.

45:10.950 --> 45:12.076
No, right, of course.

45:13.210 --> 45:15.576
I couldn't reach my phone for a while.

45:15.670 --> 45:16.989
But, yes.

45:17.080 --> 45:19.332
And you can ground me for a month.

45:19.420 --> 45:20.489
No groundings.

45:21.300 --> 45:22.460
We're just...

45:23.550 --> 45:24.960
glad you're alive.

45:26.510 --> 45:27.716
Me too, Dad.

45:47.700 --> 45:49.611
You didn't say much on the way home.

45:52.330 --> 45:53.740
I wasn't sure what to say.

45:55.830 --> 45:57.457
I didn't lie to that woman.

45:59.540 --> 46:02.122
I'm still a mother.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.753
And to not be the mother of a dead girl
for a few minutes!

46:07.180 --> 46:08.499
Should we move?

46:08.800 --> 46:09.789
What?

46:09.890 --> 46:12.211
Should we move?
Should we go somewhere and start new?

46:14.560 --> 46:15.549
And...

46:16.390 --> 46:17.345
give up the store?

46:17.440 --> 46:20.728
I'll give up the store,
give up the house, everything...

46:23.030 --> 46:24.065
if I have you.

46:25.570 --> 46:26.730
But you do.

46:28.160 --> 46:29.309
You do have me.

46:30.950 --> 46:31.939
Okay.

46:32.540 --> 46:33.575
Good.

46:38.370 --> 46:39.530
-[glass tips over]
-Shit.

46:40.580 --> 46:41.581
Damn it.

46:47.130 --> 46:49.337
I thought you had
poetry workshop tonight.

46:49.430 --> 46:50.465
Didn't go.

46:51.760 --> 46:53.250
Never going back.

46:53.640 --> 46:54.709
And we need to move.

46:56.850 --> 46:59.899
Four hundred and thirty a month,
and that's before the false alarms,

46:59.980 --> 47:01.800
which they charge you for,
even though it's their fault.

47:01.900 --> 47:05.563
You should have told me you canceled.
I was on hold with them for an hour!

47:05.690 --> 47:07.351
You know we need to cut expenses.

47:07.450 --> 47:09.065
We should have discussed it first.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.604
We live in the safest town in America!

47:10.700 --> 47:12.736
-That is not the point.
-Honey, honey.

47:12.830 --> 47:14.570
I'm just trying to make ends meet.

47:14.660 --> 47:18.118
_ And I'm not? We're either
in this together, or we are not.

47:18.210 --> 47:20.576
We can't be penny wise
and pound foolish.

47:20.670 --> 47:22.786
Right now we can't afford to be
penny foolish.

47:22.880 --> 47:25.838
Okay. I don't even know
what that means, honestly.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.911
[Mr. Baker] Means we're wasting money
on things we don't need.

47:28.010 --> 47:31.298
[Hannah]
Somet/mes the future
doesn ’t unfold the way you think it wrll.

47:32.090 --> 47:34.752
Shit happens, and people suck.

47:36.640 --> 47:38.551
Maybe thatis whyI stopped writing...

47:39.020 --> 47:41.011
and eventually started making tapes.

47:41.100 --> 47:42.397
-Listen.
-Andy, no.

47:53.200 --> 47:56.283
Some girls know all the lyrics
to each other’s songs.

47:56.660 --> 47:58.571
They ﬁnd harmonies in their laughter.

47:59.370 --> 48:01.418
Their linked elbows echo in tune.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.241
-What if I can ’t hum on key?
-[C/ay]
”What if] can’t hum on key?

48:06.050 --> 48:08.792
What if my melodies
are the ones nobody hears?"

48:09.090 --> 48:11.251
Is everyone reading that stupid magazine?

48:12.010 --> 48:13.671
I'm kind of addicted to it.

48:14.050 --> 48:15.927
-You never read it?
-No.

48:16.010 --> 48:17.420
Listen to this:

48:17.970 --> 48:20.939
"Some people can recognize a tree,

48:21.020 --> 48:23.841
a front yard,
and know they've made it home."

48:23.940 --> 48:26.317
-That sounds like shit.
-You think so?

48:27.070 --> 48:29.311
I think it feels really real.

48:30.900 --> 48:34.404
"How many circles can I walk in
before I give up looking?

48:34.660 --> 48:37.197
How long before I'm lost for good?

48:37.280 --> 48:40.283
It must be possible to swim
in the ocean of the one you love

48:40.370 --> 48:41.997
without drowning.

48:42.080 --> 48:45.493
It must be possible to swim
without becoming water yourself.

48:46.500 --> 48:49.412
But I keep swallowing
what I thought was air.

48:49.510 --> 48:51.910
I keep finding stones tied to my feet."

48:54.140 --> 48:55.334
I mean, damn.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.209
I wonder who wrote it.

48:59.850 --> 49:00.714
I know, right?

49:00.810 --> 49:03.222
One dark human being, that's for sure.

49:03.980 --> 49:05.550
I mean, I like her poem, I think,

49:05.650 --> 49:08.972
but I'm not sure
I'd want to hang out with her.

49:12.900 --> 49:14.106
Well...

49:14.200 --> 49:15.189
duty calls.

50:03.700 --> 50:04.860
[door opens]

50:14.380 --> 50:15.415
Hi, Clay.

50:16.840 --> 50:17.966
Hey, Mrs. Baker.

50:19.970 --> 50:21.597
I'm sorry to bother you at work.

50:22.810 --> 50:24.630
I wanted to give you something.

50:30.400 --> 50:31.435
It's from Hannah.

50:33.030 --> 50:35.521
Well, it's not Hannah's,
but there's a poem...

50:36.820 --> 50:37.696
that she wrote.

50:40.490 --> 50:43.618
It's really good. I mean,
even our English teacher said so.

50:48.420 --> 50:49.409
Page seven.

51:10.650 --> 51:11.856
It's her handwriting.

51:13.480 --> 51:14.526
Yeah.

51:17.030 --> 51:18.315
I know that now.

51:49.270 --> 51:51.397
[soft music plays]
