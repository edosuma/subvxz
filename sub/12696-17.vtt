WEBVTT

00:07.767 --> 00:11.333
- *

00:11.433 --> 00:12.967
- This selfie of us
is my favorite.

00:13.067 --> 00:15.167
It definitely says
we're best friends.

00:15.267 --> 00:18.233
- Yeah, I think it says
I have lettuce in my teeth.

00:18.333 --> 00:20.600
- Not as bad as that turkey
scrap on your shirt.

00:23.233 --> 00:24.533
- Cherry, if we wanna win
Best of the Besties

00:24.633 --> 00:27.067
for yearbook, our selfies need
to show us as besties,

00:27.167 --> 00:30.400
not me as #7 at
The Hoagie Hut.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.833
- Hey, guys, I just voted
for Best of the Besties.

00:32.933 --> 00:33.800
- Aw, thanks.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.567
- For Evan and Eleanor.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.300
- Hater!

00:37.400 --> 00:38.700
- Oh, no, he's not
the only one.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.367
Everyone's voting for them.

00:40.467 --> 00:43.467
- That's because Evan's
bestie is an iguana.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.733
And, look, she keeps
her food in her mouth.

00:51.467 --> 00:53.267
- All right, yearbook
voting ends in two days.

00:53.367 --> 00:55.600
We need to post another
selfie right now.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.867
- Hey, looks like the deli
is closed. Post it.

01:05.967 --> 01:09.933
- Take that, iguana boy!

01:10.067 --> 01:12.200
- Uh, oh, look behind us.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.367
The Thunderman portrait!

01:14.467 --> 01:17.900
No one can see that.
Delete! Delete! Delete!

01:18.067 --> 01:19.400
- Okay, it's gone!

01:19.500 --> 01:22.067
Whew, that was close.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.233
If non-supes saw that,
we'd be exposed.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.867
Super President Kickbutt
would not be happy.

01:26.967 --> 01:29.167
- FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert! Alert!

01:29.267 --> 01:31.967
Incoming transmission from
Super President Kickbutt--

01:32.067 --> 01:35.533
and she is not happy.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.533
- See ya!

01:40.833 --> 01:42.633
- *

01:42.733 --> 01:43.800
* What you see

01:43.900 --> 01:45.533
* Is not what you get

01:45.633 --> 01:48.833
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

01:48.933 --> 01:50.600
* We fit right in

01:50.700 --> 01:52.267
* Bet you never guessed

01:52.367 --> 01:53.733
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

01:53.833 --> 01:55.367
* Just like all the rest

01:55.467 --> 01:57.233
* A picture
perfect family *

01:57.333 --> 01:59.067
* Is what we try to be

01:59.133 --> 02:00.467
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:00.567 --> 02:02.300
* The crazy things we do

02:02.400 --> 02:03.933
* This isn't
make believe *

02:04.067 --> 02:05.300
* It's our reality

02:05.400 --> 02:06.800
* Just your average family

02:06.900 --> 02:10.167
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:10.267 --> 02:13.200
* Livin' a double life *

02:17.433 --> 02:20.267
- I deleted the photos so fast.
How did you see it?

02:20.367 --> 02:22.367
- We monitor everything, Phoebe.

02:22.467 --> 02:25.800
By the way, don't eat your
lunch--Billy licked it.

02:28.067 --> 02:31.867
If any photos showing you as
superheroes actually got out,

02:31.967 --> 02:35.333
the consequences for your
family would be unspeakable.

02:35.433 --> 02:36.633
- I know. I'm so, so sorry,

02:36.733 --> 02:38.433
and I can promise
it won't happen again.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.333
- That's what you
said after Cherry

02:40.433 --> 02:43.567
wore your super-suit
for Halloween.

02:43.667 --> 02:46.200
Further action will
need to be taken.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.600
You can't ground me,
can you?

02:49.700 --> 02:52.733
- Girl, I could ground your
parents if I wanted to.

02:54.167 --> 02:57.067
But you're not the problem.
Cherry is.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.467
You are to stay away from her

02:58.567 --> 03:01.600
until the Hero League decides
on a course of action.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.567
Your future with us
depends on it.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.667
- Whoa.

03:05.767 --> 03:07.300
So, if I wanna keep
being a superhero,

03:07.400 --> 03:09.600
I have to avoid
my best friend?

03:09.700 --> 03:11.200
Can't I avoid
something else--

03:11.300 --> 03:14.233
like the cafeteria's
clam chowder?

03:14.333 --> 03:17.100
I'm pretty sure those
aren't clams.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.367
- I'm sorry, but when it comes
to matters of security,

03:19.467 --> 03:21.467
there's no compromising.

03:21.567 --> 03:23.667
President Kickbutt, out.

03:23.767 --> 03:25.067
- But...

03:26.700 --> 03:27.867
- Phoebe, I need some advice.

03:27.967 --> 03:28.867
- Maybe later.

03:28.967 --> 03:31.333
- So, there's this
cute boy, Owen.

03:31.433 --> 03:34.167
I'm inviting him over for
a play date in two days.

03:34.267 --> 03:36.800
It has to be perfect.
What should I do?

03:36.900 --> 03:38.567
I'll tell
you what to do.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.133
Don't ever become friends
with him or anyone else

03:40.233 --> 03:42.567
because Super President Kickbutt
wants you to grow old alone!

03:45.400 --> 03:47.433
- You should just
talk about farts.

03:47.533 --> 03:50.433
Boys think they're hysterical.

03:50.533 --> 03:52.300
Oh, farts...

03:52.400 --> 03:53.867
It's like your butt
is talking.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.900
He's chatty today.

04:01.467 --> 04:03.333
- Okay, uh, what about...

04:03.433 --> 04:04.633
this one?

04:04.733 --> 04:08.300
I trained a bunch of
stray cats to pick pockets.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.067
- Nice work, Bootsie!

04:18.567 --> 04:21.233
- I'm impressed...
- Thank you.

04:21.333 --> 04:22.800
- ...with myself.
- Oh.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.600
- Because I've finally
figured out

04:24.700 --> 04:27.433
why nothing you do
seems evil enough.

04:27.533 --> 04:31.067
It's your baby face.

04:31.100 --> 04:34.100
Well, the ladies don't seem
to have a problem with it.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.967
* Wah Wah
- Playa!

04:37.933 --> 04:39.133
- Silence!

04:39.233 --> 04:41.167
Every time I look
at your mug,

04:41.267 --> 04:43.233
I want to pinch
those little cheeks,

04:43.333 --> 04:46.267
then rip them off the bone!

04:46.367 --> 04:47.833
- Well...what am
I supposed to do--

04:47.933 --> 04:50.067
hide behind some silly
mask or something?

04:51.667 --> 04:53.767
Which would be
an awesome look!

04:54.733 --> 04:57.133
- Just figure it out,
baby face.

05:01.233 --> 05:04.067
Do I really
have a baby face, Colosso?

05:04.133 --> 05:05.933
- That's our curse, Max--

05:06.067 --> 05:07.733
we're just too adorable.

05:09.633 --> 05:12.200
- Well, you know what
would make me look evil--

05:12.300 --> 05:13.900
facial hair.

05:14.067 --> 05:15.867
Ooh, what if I...

05:15.967 --> 05:19.133
altered the nose hairalyzer
so it'd give me an evil beard?

05:19.233 --> 05:21.967
- I guess it's better
than my plan to shave my fur

05:22.067 --> 05:24.333
and tape it to your face.

05:24.433 --> 05:26.133
Though that would
make us closer.

05:30.133 --> 05:34.367
- Phoebe!
- Phoe-to-the-be!

05:36.467 --> 05:40.300
- Oh, you know, just gettin'
our burger on.

05:40.400 --> 05:44.333
- Daddy put on skinny jeans.

05:44.433 --> 05:47.133
- Oh, I see what's
going on here.

05:47.233 --> 05:49.067
Super President Kickbutt told
you I have to stay away

05:49.133 --> 05:52.200
from my best friend, so you're
here to be the new Cherry.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.467
- Daddy can't sit down.

05:54.567 --> 05:56.433
- Oh, ho, Chloe,
that is not...

05:56.533 --> 05:57.933
true, it...

05:58.067 --> 05:59.267
all right...

05:59.367 --> 06:01.467
You know what?
I'll just...I'll stand,

06:01.567 --> 06:02.933
and take a selfie.

06:03.067 --> 06:06.100
Excuse me, could you take
a selfie for us, please?

06:07.900 --> 06:09.867
- Later waiter,
Christian Slater.

06:09.967 --> 06:13.400
Okay, I'm just
embarrassing myself now.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.867
Sweetie, I'm sorry it
has to be this way.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.433
How did Cherry take the news?

06:17.533 --> 06:19.367
- Well, surprisingly well--

06:19.467 --> 06:21.733
mostly 'cause
I didn't tell her yet.

06:21.833 --> 06:23.533
- Phoebe, you're going
to have to tell her.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.733
She deserves to know.

06:24.833 --> 06:26.500
- I know. I just couldn't.

06:26.600 --> 06:27.800
I avoided her all day.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.233
- You can't do that forever.
- Sure, I can.

06:30.333 --> 06:32.767
As long as I've got my...

06:32.867 --> 06:35.133
Randy the Trucker disguise.

06:35.233 --> 06:38.833
Breaker, breaker, ain't no
Phoebe here, good buddy.

06:38.933 --> 06:41.433
- You're going to have
to tell her the truth.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.767
- Your mother's right.

06:45.367 --> 06:48.533
- Bye-bye, skinny jeans.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.200
- Oh, hello, Evan.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.400
- Phoebe,
Mr. and Mrs. Thunderman,

06:53.500 --> 06:55.600
small girl who I don't know.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.100
Where's Cherry?
Trouble in Paradise?

06:57.200 --> 06:59.233
- No, she's just--
- Speaking of Paradise,

06:59.333 --> 07:01.333
check out my latest
post of Eleanor.

07:01.433 --> 07:04.067
- BARB: Oh, you have
a girlfriend--

07:04.100 --> 07:06.067
who's a reptile.

07:06.167 --> 07:09.067
Well, you two look
very happy together.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.500
- It's not too late for
you and Cherry to back out.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
Nice seeing you again,

07:12.700 --> 07:15.600
Mr. and Mrs. Thunderman,
small girl.

07:17.067 --> 07:18.500
- Uh, yearbook competition
that Cherry and I

07:18.600 --> 07:20.900
will definitely lose
after I talk to her.

07:21.067 --> 07:24.167
Guess Evan and Eleanor will be
Best of the Besties again.

07:24.267 --> 07:28.300
- Oh, they're just friends.
Okay, good.

07:30.067 --> 07:31.800
- I'm getting close, Colosso.

07:31.900 --> 07:34.067
- So, what beard style
are you goin' with?

07:34.133 --> 07:37.067
The Lincoln Lover
or the Sassy Lumberjack?

07:38.633 --> 07:39.967
- Max, I need your help.
- Maybe later.

07:40.067 --> 07:41.767
- So, there's this
cute boy, Owen...

07:43.533 --> 07:44.900
He's coming over for
a play date today

07:45.067 --> 07:47.067
and I still don't
know what to do.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.600
- Yeech, girly drama.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.633
What should we play?

07:52.733 --> 07:54.600
Should I serve snacks?
Help me!

07:54.700 --> 07:58.233
- Wow, you really
sound desperate.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.300
Close the door
on your way out.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.800
- You're the worst
big brother ever.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.100
- Put it on a t-shirt.

08:06.567 --> 08:07.800
Now why is this thing
not working?

08:17.833 --> 08:19.333
- What are you two
fools starin' at?

08:26.867 --> 08:30.867
- Ah, the Bearded Lady.
Excellent choice.

08:30.967 --> 08:33.733
Reverse it!

08:33.833 --> 08:36.267
- The nose hairalyzer doesn't
really have a reverse.

08:36.367 --> 08:38.200
I'll just shave it off.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.333
- And that should do it.

08:46.433 --> 08:48.533
Just like new.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.767
I thought you shaved it off.

08:57.867 --> 08:59.233
- I did. I grew back.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.933
- Like the smile on my face.

09:02.067 --> 09:05.400
- I can't have a play date
looking like a dirty wizard.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.933
- Don't worry, Nora, I'll fix
it before your play date,

09:08.067 --> 09:09.467
but you'll have to skip school.

09:09.567 --> 09:11.233
Just tell Mom and Dad
you're sick.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.367
- Well, my throat
does feel scratchy--

09:13.467 --> 09:15.067
'cause there's a beard on it!

09:19.933 --> 09:22.567
- It's you and me, Eleanor.
We're gonna win this thing.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.633
- Ow!

09:24.733 --> 09:26.333
You're right. My fault.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.733
- Okay...

09:29.833 --> 09:31.900
all I have to do
is tell the truth.

09:32.067 --> 09:33.200
How hard could it be?

09:33.300 --> 09:35.300
I have some bad news.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.633
The Hero League has forbidden
me to be friends with you.

09:37.733 --> 09:39.900
We can never talk again.

09:40.067 --> 09:43.067
- Okay, well, then I guess
I'm doing this.

09:43.167 --> 09:47.133
Phoebe Thunderman
has superpowers!

09:47.233 --> 09:50.400
- Okay, so, the truth
won't work.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.667
I'll just have
to keep my bestie

09:52.767 --> 09:54.733
and hide our friendship
from the Hero League.

09:58.733 --> 10:01.367
You missed the weirdest
trucker yesterday.

10:01.467 --> 10:04.800
You didn't get in trouble with
the Hero League, did you?

10:04.900 --> 10:06.200
- Oh, no, no, no.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.300
That was just about some
paperwork I forgot to fill out.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.933
You know, sign some stuff,
stamp some stuff,

10:11.033 --> 10:13.633
sign, stamp, sign, stamp,
work, work, work!

10:13.733 --> 10:16.600
- Oh, that was close.
Relief selfie.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.067
- Um, let's not post
stuff like that anymore.

10:20.167 --> 10:21.667
- Then how are we supposed
to get enough votes

10:21.767 --> 10:23.700
to with the Best
of the Besties?

10:23.800 --> 10:25.667
- Well, let's be different--

10:25.767 --> 10:27.633
spread the word
the old-fashioned way.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.300
- Yeah, yeah, with dance.

10:37.967 --> 10:39.467
- Staircase dance.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.000
- PRESIDENT KICKBUTT:
What is it, Agent Delta?

10:44.100 --> 10:46.533
- Phoebe Thunderman has violated
your orders, ma'am.

10:46.633 --> 10:50.467
I have proof she did not sever
ties with her friend Cherry.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.400
- I was afraid of that.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.800
- Don't worry, I'll handle it.

11:02.967 --> 11:05.067
- Vote for me and Cherry--
Best of the Besties,

11:05.100 --> 11:06.667
because friends don't keep
friends in a cage

11:06.767 --> 11:08.933
and feed them crickets.

11:09.067 --> 11:12.467
- Eleanor likes her cage
and her crickets are delicious.

11:14.167 --> 11:16.767
- It was dark in
that theater.

11:16.867 --> 11:18.333
Hey, Cherry was
looking for you.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.100
She was heading towards
the nurse's office.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.267
- Oh, no, I told her not
to eat that clam chowder.

11:23.367 --> 11:25.300
Clams don't have bones.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.733
- Hey, Cherry, Phoebe
was just looking for you.

11:32.833 --> 11:34.267
I can show you where
she is, if you want.

11:34.367 --> 11:35.333
- Okay, thanks.

11:36.967 --> 11:39.367
You're going to prom
with Eleanor, aren't you?

11:39.467 --> 11:41.467
- It's really up to her.

11:44.767 --> 11:47.333
Cherry, wait...

11:59.467 --> 12:02.333
- Here's some more chicken
noodle soup, Nora.

12:02.433 --> 12:05.600
- I'll give it to her. Just take
off those skinny jeans.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.267
- Oh, even with
my super-strength...

12:08.400 --> 12:09.967
I can't rip 'em off.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.133
- Thanks, guys, but I'm fine.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.167
You really don't
have to watch me.

12:15.267 --> 12:16.833
- Oh, okay, good, because
Chloe needs to take us

12:16.933 --> 12:18.067
to the Metroburg Hospital

12:18.167 --> 12:20.800
to get your dad
outta these pants.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.933
- It's a fashion emergency.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.400
Just wanted to let you
know I'm almost done

12:34.500 --> 12:36.200
fixing the nose hairalyzer.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.800
- You'd better be.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.533
- Gross. Is your beard
growing worms?

12:42.633 --> 12:44.367
- They're soup noodles.

12:44.467 --> 12:46.767
This thing's a food magnet.

12:51.133 --> 12:53.067
- I'm just gonna cancel
my play date with Owen.

12:53.133 --> 12:55.600
- Oh, come on, Nora. I only
need a few more minutes.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.267
Have I ever let you down?

12:57.367 --> 12:59.500
- You've seen the badger
on my face, right?

13:02.967 --> 13:05.100
I can't take any chances.

13:09.667 --> 13:12.067
- Billy, I'm glad
I caught you.

13:12.133 --> 13:13.700
You've gotta tell
Owen I'm sick.

13:13.800 --> 13:17.067
- Nora says to tell
you she's sick.

13:19.900 --> 13:23.867
- Sick of waiting for
this play date to start.

13:28.467 --> 13:31.567
- Oh, hey, girls,
have you guys seen Cherry?

13:31.667 --> 13:34.133
- We saw her and Evan leave
just a few minutes ago.

13:34.233 --> 13:36.267
- He knew I was looking for her.
Why didn't he tell her?

13:36.367 --> 13:39.167
- The guy's best friend is an
iguana and that's your question?

13:52.500 --> 13:53.967
Cherry!

13:54.067 --> 13:57.833
- Boost audio 25 percent.

13:57.933 --> 13:59.233
- EVAN: ...regarding
operations...

13:59.333 --> 14:01.067
- Boost audio 50 percent.
- EVAN: ...top priority.

14:01.167 --> 14:02.200
- Just boost it all the way!

14:02.300 --> 14:03.967
- EVAN: She's gonna wanna
take this call.

14:04.067 --> 14:06.567
Super President Kickbutt,
this is Agent Delta.

14:08.367 --> 14:09.600
- I have the security threat

14:09.700 --> 14:12.633
and I'm bringing her in for
a complete memory wipe.

14:14.667 --> 14:16.533
Oh, what have I done?

14:17.933 --> 14:19.867
- When I find you,
Jesse James,

14:19.967 --> 14:23.067
you're goin' to jail.

14:23.133 --> 14:25.367
- Okay, but you'll never get
this bandana off my face.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.900
- Guess what's working now,
my little tween wolf?

14:36.067 --> 14:37.533
- It better be.

14:37.633 --> 14:38.733
We've had to play dumb games

14:38.833 --> 14:41.567
like cowboy train robbery
to hide my face.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.300
What am I, five?

14:43.400 --> 14:45.067
- Not with that beard,
you're not.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.067
- Ow!

14:46.133 --> 14:47.533
- Let's do this.

14:47.633 --> 14:50.300
- Put yer hands up, Jesse.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.200
And turn around
nice and slow.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.067
Wow...

14:58.100 --> 15:00.633
you take this
game seriously.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.933
It looks so real.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.767
- Ow!

15:03.867 --> 15:06.367
- Wait, it is real.

15:06.467 --> 15:10.333
- Uh, so, about those
farts, huh?

15:12.467 --> 15:13.567
- Heh, farts.

15:15.767 --> 15:17.533
- I can't take
my eyes off it.

15:17.633 --> 15:20.067
- I'll save you the trouble.
Just leave.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.167
Well, before you do,
you should know that

15:28.267 --> 15:30.800
my little sister was all worried
about making today perfect,

15:30.900 --> 15:33.233
and I told her it doesn't matter
what she does on her play date,

15:33.333 --> 15:36.200
or how she looks,
that she's an awesome girl,

15:36.300 --> 15:38.667
and any boy should
like her for that.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.500
- You never said that to me.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.633
- I should have.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.733
So, if you don't like
this little sasquatch

15:44.833 --> 15:48.733
for who she is on the inside,
maybe you should hit the road.

15:50.067 --> 15:52.567
- Thanks.

15:52.667 --> 15:53.933
Bye, Owen.

15:54.067 --> 15:58.100
- I don't wanna leave.
I never did.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.900
In fact, seeing your
beard has given me

16:01.067 --> 16:03.367
the courage to share
my secret.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.167
- Yeesh, backsquatch.

16:13.833 --> 16:16.433
- You sound like my doctors.

16:16.533 --> 16:19.500
I should have known you
weren't ready for it.

16:19.600 --> 16:20.867
- Owen, wait.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.500
- Forgot your backpack.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.233
- Ignore him.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.933
I'm fine with
your back hair,

16:32.067 --> 16:34.233
just like you're
fine with my beard.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.433
So, if you don't
have to go,

16:36.533 --> 16:38.400
there's some of your favorite
pizza we can eat.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.633
- Can this play date
get any better?

16:42.867 --> 16:45.100
You want me to zap it off?

16:47.067 --> 16:49.767
- Yeah. You should
see my test subject.

16:51.533 --> 16:54.133
- Be honest, Colosso,
how does it look?

16:54.233 --> 16:57.500
- You look like
a middle-aged accountant.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.100
- Yes!

16:59.200 --> 17:00.500
What's an accountant?

17:04.667 --> 17:07.367
- It's okay. I can lose
the beard after the play date.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.900
- Sometimes it sweats.

17:20.367 --> 17:23.267
- EVAN: Wait here. This'll be
over before you know it.

17:23.367 --> 17:25.767
- Listen, I know that you can't
tell me why I'm here,

17:25.867 --> 17:28.300
but now that I know
you're a secret agent,

17:28.400 --> 17:29.800
wanna get a burger sometime?

17:29.900 --> 17:32.300
- Sorry, Cherry, I'm taken.

17:33.833 --> 17:36.133
- You know where to find me.

17:39.367 --> 17:41.133
- Phoebe! Oh, my gosh.

17:42.233 --> 17:44.400
Did you know that
Evan is a secret agent?

17:44.500 --> 17:47.367
I think they're recruiting
me to be a superhero.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.333
- Cherry, they brought you
here to erase your memory.

17:50.433 --> 17:53.333
- A superhero who
can't remember anything.

17:53.433 --> 17:55.367
I'm halfway there already.

17:55.467 --> 17:58.067
- No, this isn't about
you becoming a superhero.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.200
The Hero League wanted me to
stop being friends with you

18:00.300 --> 18:02.500
because of that selfie you
posted, but I refused.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.900
Now we have to get
you outta here.

18:06.467 --> 18:08.967
- Phoebe.
- Hey, Evan--

18:09.067 --> 18:10.700
if that's even
your real name.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.433
- It's not. It's Lucius.

18:14.733 --> 18:16.900
- Well, I'm gonna
stick with Evan.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.300
Oh, uh, good news.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.833
I took care of erasing
Cherry's memory myself.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.333
Cherry, name the 50 states.

18:23.433 --> 18:27.067
- I can't do that.
Success.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.933
- Nice try, but I don't think
you understand what's happening.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.467
- I completely understand

18:31.567 --> 18:33.600
and you need to release my
friend or pay the consequences.

18:40.733 --> 18:44.233
What did you do?

18:44.333 --> 18:46.100
- I neutralized
your superpowers.

18:46.200 --> 18:48.200
- Whoa, some watch.

18:48.300 --> 18:50.233
Where can I get one?

18:50.333 --> 18:52.500
- It took me 30 years of
training to earn this watch.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.933
How old are you?

18:55.067 --> 18:56.167
- Old enough to know

18:56.267 --> 18:57.967
Cherry's a serious risk
to the Thundermans.

18:58.067 --> 19:00.833
- And I'm a serious
risk to you.

19:12.567 --> 19:14.267
- I'm saving my best friend.

19:14.367 --> 19:16.100
The Hero League
has gone too far.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.333
Memory wiping and spying
on me in school?

19:18.433 --> 19:19.533
My straight "A"s
and perfect attendance

19:19.633 --> 19:21.900
are none of your business.

19:22.067 --> 19:26.500
- Agent Delta wasn't spying,
he was protecting you.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.600
The Thunderman family
is very valuable to us.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.700
- Yeah, well, Cherry
is very valuable to me.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.367
Her friendship
is the best thing

19:32.467 --> 19:34.100
that's happened to me since
moving to Hiddenville.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.233
- Aww...

19:36.333 --> 19:37.967
- If I have to sacrifice
being a superhero

19:38.067 --> 19:40.233
to keep you from attaching one
of those gizmos to her brain

19:40.333 --> 19:44.433
and erasing her memory,
then I will.

19:44.533 --> 19:47.467
- Sacrifice selfie.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.733
- You really can't
remember anything.

19:54.433 --> 19:56.167
We're not erasing her memory.

19:56.267 --> 19:58.800
We're erasing
her phone's memory.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.867
- Cherry continued
to take pictures

20:02.967 --> 20:05.467
when we ordered you
to end contact with her.

20:05.567 --> 20:08.800
That forced our hand
and here we are--

20:08.900 --> 20:12.767
a broken lab cart and
a 50-year-old man on his back.

20:12.867 --> 20:14.367
!

20:14.467 --> 20:17.667
- That's my superpower.
I don't age.

20:20.067 --> 20:21.900
- Never mind about
that burger.

20:23.267 --> 20:25.067
- I'm so sorry about this.

20:25.167 --> 20:29.067
- You really thought we were
going to erase Cherry's memory?

20:29.167 --> 20:30.900
We're not animals, Phoebe.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.267
We're the good guys.

20:32.367 --> 20:34.133
- You can't fire me.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.400
I didn't know it was

20:35.500 --> 20:37.400
Super President Kickbutt's
parking spot.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.733
- That was unfortunate timing.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.233
Cell phone, please?

20:43.333 --> 20:46.033
- I got a good one of
that guy getting fired.

20:46.133 --> 20:48.367
Be sure to tag me, okay?

20:50.600 --> 20:51.900
Thank you for
fighting for me.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.100
- Hey, it's what
best friends do.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.100
Who cares what
the kids at school think.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.000
We know we're
the Best of the Besties.

21:01.100 --> 21:04.200
- I'm glad you feel that way
because Eleanor and I just won

21:04.300 --> 21:06.533
Best of the Besties
for the third time.

21:06.633 --> 21:10.200
- Great! We lost to an old man
and his weird lizard.

21:10.300 --> 21:11.800
- Congratulations, Evan.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.167
- It's Lucius.
- Still stickin' with Evan.

21:14.267 --> 21:17.467
- Well, since my nerd cover is
blown, I guess this is goodbye.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.267
Gotta get home to the kids.

21:20.367 --> 21:22.333
!

21:23.433 --> 21:24.900
- Sorry, Mr. Mayhem,

21:25.067 --> 21:26.867
but you're gonna have
to deal with this baby face.

21:26.967 --> 21:30.500
I don't need facial hair because
I'm evil on the inside.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.500
- I'm disappointed
in him, too, sir.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.300
- I have proof that I'm evil.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.367
- Look what I did
to this little girl.

21:41.167 --> 21:45.967
Giving a little girl a beard is
not only evil, it's hilarious.

21:46.067 --> 21:48.700
- I've never been more
proud of him, too, sir.

21:48.800 --> 21:52.067
- Stop kissing my butt,
you filthy rabbit.

21:58.367 --> 22:00.900
Do you wanna explain this?

22:04.067 --> 22:04.900
- Nope.

22:10.833 --> 22:26.733
- *
