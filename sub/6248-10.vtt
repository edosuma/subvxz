00:03.937 --> 00:06.462
[Brennan]
It's getting thicker and thicker in here.

00:06.539 --> 00:10.202
That's why the forensic team got lost.
I've sent somebody back to find 'em.

00:10.276 --> 00:12.369
You sure you know
where you're goin'?

00:12.445 --> 00:14.709
I still have trouble,
and I've been here for three years.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.908
<i>That's why we advise hikers</i>
<i>to stay away.</i>

00:16.983 --> 00:18.883
I know I'm pining for concrete.

00:18.952 --> 00:22.854
You just, uh...
You stay close, all right, Bones?

00:29.696 --> 00:34.565
I don't want you to get caught
out here when it gets dark, okay?

00:36.403 --> 00:39.668
<i>Bones? Bones?</i>

00:41.074 --> 00:43.008
Where the hell are you?
Bones?

00:43.076 --> 00:45.067
I'm right here, Booth.

00:45.145 --> 00:47.409
- Don't do that, all right?
- <i>What?</i>

00:47.480 --> 00:50.472
- Take off like that, okay? You heard the guy.
- I saw this.

00:50.550 --> 00:54.486
<i>It's some sort of talisman.</i>
<i>These are bones from a bird.</i>

00:54.554 --> 00:57.921
<i>And the coloring on the ornament</i>
<i>looks like dried blood.</i>

00:57.991 --> 01:01.324
<i>There are more of'em too.</i>

01:01.394 --> 01:03.453
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>These, they look like eyes.</i>

01:03.530 --> 01:08.229
- Okay, this is weird. You see a lot of these?
- Not me.

01:08.301 --> 01:11.361
But I've heard some other folks have come
across some pretty strange stuff in here.

01:11.438 --> 01:14.771
- Word is it's Maggie Cinders.
- There's a woman who lives out here?

01:14.841 --> 01:17.969
Did.
Died in 1780.

01:18.044 --> 01:21.013
<i>Folks around here thought</i>
<i>she was a witch and beheaded her.</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:23.845
<i>Legend is she still haunts the woods</i>
<i>looking for her severed head.</i>

01:23.917 --> 01:26.283
<i>And you believe this, Ranger Edison?</i>

01:26.352 --> 01:29.185
<i>Look, I'm just telling you</i>
<i>what I heard.</i>

01:29.255 --> 01:32.782
Yeah, I'd prefer we keep moving, okay?

01:32.859 --> 01:35.054
<i>[Edison]</i>
<i>This is one of the only clearings around here.</i>

01:35.128 --> 01:37.062
<i>The pit was covered</i>
<i>with sticks and leaves.</i>

01:37.130 --> 01:42.158
<i>One of the hikers fell in on the body,</i>
<i>freaked, and ran.</i>

01:42.235 --> 01:46.695
Maggie Cinders did say she'd kill
anybody who dared to look for her.

01:46.773 --> 01:51.039
So you talked to Miss Cinders? That must've
been difficult since she doesn't have a head.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.011
<i>Bag the eyes.</i>
<i>Give me a hand.</i>

01:53.079 --> 01:55.411
<i>You want me to</i>
<i>go down there with you?</i>

01:55.482 --> 01:58.974
- No. I don't want the remains compromised.
- You all right?

01:59.052 --> 02:01.077
- Yeah.
- <i>[Insects Buzzing]</i>

02:01.154 --> 02:03.486
So, uh, how'd she kill 'em,
you know, in the legend?

02:03.556 --> 02:07.686
Like she was killed.
She cuts off their heads.

02:11.097 --> 02:14.555
Iliac crest and pubis show it's male.

02:14.634 --> 02:19.571
Epiphyseal fusion puts him
between 18 and 25 years old.

02:19.639 --> 02:23.040
He's on a... a video camera.

02:23.109 --> 02:25.202
Cause of death?

02:25.278 --> 02:27.508
Well, since I can't find his skull...

02:27.580 --> 02:30.743
I'd say... his head got cut off.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074

02:39.425 --> 02:42.053
Since we don't have a head,
do we have enough for an identification?

02:42.128 --> 02:45.291
We'll look for older injuries
that might be found in medical records.

02:45.365 --> 02:47.731
More wood splinters.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.291
Could've been the handle
of whatever lopped off his head.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.702
<i>If a ghost isn't comprised</i>
<i>of matter but is merely ectoplasm...</i>

02:52.772 --> 02:55.798
which is actually the clear outer layer
of cytoplasm on amoeboid cells...

02:55.875 --> 02:58.901
<i>how can the victim have suffered</i>
<i>bruising and multiple fractures?</i>

02:58.978 --> 03:01.276
Because there are
no such things as ghosts.

03:01.347 --> 03:04.145
I thought you never
jump to conclusions?

03:04.217 --> 03:07.380
Well, it's safe to dismiss
fantasy and deluded perceptions.

03:07.453 --> 03:10.650
My mother came to me
the day after she died.

03:13.993 --> 03:16.223
I wasn't some kid.
I was 23. She came to me...

03:17.564 --> 03:20.829
She came to me and told me
to look in her dresser...

03:20.900 --> 03:23.164
third drawer,
behind her pink blouse.

03:23.236 --> 03:27.434
There was something there for me.

03:27.507 --> 03:30.408
<i>[Hodgins] The European hornet queen</i>
<i>I found on the remains...</i>

03:30.476 --> 03:33.138
puts the time of death
at November of last year.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.943
- We have more splinters.
- Wood.

03:36.015 --> 03:37.676
It's from a <i>Betula uber...</i>

03:37.750 --> 03:42.016
<i>a subspecies of round-leafbirch tree</i>
<i>that's been extinct since 1800.</i>

03:42.088 --> 03:45.649
<i>The legend says that</i>
<i>Maggie Cinders kills her victims...</i>

03:45.725 --> 03:50.424
with the same old ax
used to decapitate her in 1783.

03:51.931 --> 03:55.094
Anyone else feeling tingly,
or is it just me?

03:55.168 --> 03:58.729
<i>I checked missing persons. A film student from</i>
<i>U. V.A. went missing in the woods last year.</i>

03:58.805 --> 04:01.638
He was making a documentary
on the Maggie Cinders legend.

04:01.708 --> 04:05.838
<i>Graham Hastings, 21,</i>
<i>5'10", 176 pounds.</i>

04:05.912 --> 04:08.938
- That explains the video camera.
- <i>[Angela] I,</i> um...

04:09.015 --> 04:11.711
I got something from the videotape.

04:13.386 --> 04:16.480
I cleaned a section of the tape
with an isopropyl alcohol solution...

04:16.555 --> 04:20.788
<i>and fed whatever digital information</i>
<i>I could salvage into a restoration program.</i>

04:20.860 --> 04:23.385
- I didn't get much.
- <i>[Woman Screams]</i>

04:23.463 --> 04:25.795
Maybe I got too much.

04:25.865 --> 04:29.460
- Brian? Brian!
- [Chopping Sounds]

04:29.535 --> 04:32.368
<i>[Man] Lori, wait!</i>
<i>Where are you going? Lori, stop!</i>

04:32.438 --> 04:35.635
- Stop, Lori!
- <i>[Lori] Brian! Brian!</i>

04:37.277 --> 04:43.079
<i>[Lori Screams]</i>
<i>No! It's blood!</i>

04:43.149 --> 04:46.346
[Panting]
Oh, God. The noises are getting closer.

04:46.419 --> 04:50.719
- I've lost Lori, and Brian's disappeared.
- [Chopping Sounds Continue]

04:50.790 --> 04:54.157
<i>[Sobbing]</i>
<i>Oh, God. It's her. I can hear her.</i>

04:54.227 --> 04:57.196
She's here. She's here!
Oh, God, she's here!

04:57.263 --> 05:01.927
Lori, where the hell are you?
Lori!

05:02.001 --> 05:04.561
Oh, my God.
Help!

05:04.637 --> 05:06.400
<i>Help me!</i>
<i>Oh, God!</i>

05:06.472 --> 05:09.202
Oh, God!
Somebody help me!

05:10.777 --> 05:14.008
Somebody help me, please!

05:14.080 --> 05:18.540
<i>[Screaming]</i>

05:51.384 --> 05:53.409
<i>[Zack]</i>
<i>I just keep hearing the screams.</i>

05:53.486 --> 05:56.649
- I've never heard screams like that, Dr. Brennan.
- Neither have I.

05:56.723 --> 06:01.717
Narrow focus trauma
on the left humerus, posterior side.

06:01.794 --> 06:04.763
- Indicates an attempt by the victim
to shield his head.
- From the ax attack.

06:04.831 --> 06:07.994
<i>What?</i>
<i>It's always an ax, isn't it?</i>

06:08.067 --> 06:11.628
- Remember <i>The Shining?</i>
- My palms perspired profusely during that film.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.332
Until we complete a series
of blade comparison tests...

06:14.407 --> 06:17.501
there's no way to know
what type of weapon was used.

06:17.577 --> 06:20.808
- Forensic team found this near the pit.
- Looks organic.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.348
Definitely decomposing.

06:23.416 --> 06:26.579
Victim's preliminary tox screen
came back negative. No drugs.

06:26.652 --> 06:28.950
- That's too bad.
- Why?

06:29.021 --> 06:31.683
Because drugs would explain the writings
I found inside Graham's backpack.

06:31.758 --> 06:35.751
I'm cleaning them and taking mud samples,
but I think Booth should show 'em to a profiler.

06:35.828 --> 06:39.787
<i>They're handwritten, scrawled.</i>
<i>And so far, all I can make out is...</i>

06:39.866 --> 06:42.334
"Maggie came to me again, calling me."

06:42.402 --> 06:44.666
And last but not least...

06:44.737 --> 06:48.833
<i>"They will scream for air,</i>
<i>but their lungs will fill with blood. "</i>

06:48.908 --> 06:51.638
<i>I'll redo the tox screen.</i>

06:51.711 --> 06:55.943
I may be alone in this,
but I think one of us...

06:56.015 --> 07:00.714
<i>should remain a rational human being</i>
<i>during this investigation.</i>

07:00.787 --> 07:06.020
Got it. Comminuted fracture
to the ulna. Professionally set.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.493
<i>From the degree of callous formation,</i>
<i>that's a childhood injury.</i>

07:09.562 --> 07:13.692
One that could give us the I.D. we want.
I'll call Booth, tell him to contact next of kin.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.030
<i>Zack, place some garlic</i>
<i>around the remains...</i>

07:16.102 --> 07:19.037
and chant the Hmong ritual
for preservation of souls.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.130
Really?

07:21.207 --> 07:24.040
[Chuckles]
This is going to be a long case.

07:26.646 --> 07:30.082
<i>[Man] Graham broke his arm</i>
<i>sliding into second base.</i>

07:30.149 --> 07:32.413
Um, he was eight.

07:32.485 --> 07:36.888
It's a match.
I'm very sorry.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.947
Thanks.

07:40.493 --> 07:43.291
Look.
I can't say that I'm surprised.

07:43.362 --> 07:47.765
He, uh... He was missing for a year.
But still, when you hear...

07:47.834 --> 07:51.702
It was just us, you know?
My parents died in a car accident.

07:51.771 --> 07:54.968
I was 18 and he was 13, and, uh...

07:55.041 --> 07:57.669
When something like that happens,
when you lose your parents at that age...

07:57.743 --> 08:00.803
it's just people don't understand
how close you become.

08:00.880 --> 08:05.544
I lost mine when I was 15.
It was just me and my brother too.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.552
And he was 19.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.451
Sorry.

08:09.522 --> 08:13.253
<i>Did Graham live with relatives,</i>
<i>or did he go into foster care?</i>

08:13.326 --> 08:15.817
<i>God, no. I would never</i>
<i>let him go into the system.</i>

08:15.895 --> 08:20.696
I, uh...
I dropped out of college.

08:20.766 --> 08:24.395
I joined the fire department
to support him.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.938
Your brother didn't...

08:28.808 --> 08:30.776
It was a difficult situation for him.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.107
I understand.

08:34.179 --> 08:38.741
I mean, you know, it seems like
you turned out okay though.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.817
Do you know who Graham was with
the night he disappeared?

08:46.893 --> 08:49.828
Yeah.
A couple of film students from school.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.330
There was a guy and a girl.
I tried to get the guy...

08:52.398 --> 08:54.332
Brian, his name was...
to help with the search.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.767
But he was too freaked to go back into
the woods. I've never seen someone so scared.

08:57.837 --> 09:01.000
So you were involved
with the search?

09:01.073 --> 09:04.907
I've led a lot of search-and-rescue operations
as a firefighter. Um...

09:04.977 --> 09:07.775
I should've found him.

09:07.847 --> 09:12.409
- It's not your fault.
- I should've locked him in his damn room.

09:12.485 --> 09:16.785
I mean, everyone knows
weird things happen in those woods.

09:21.661 --> 09:24.494
The chatter marks mean the vertebrae
weren't split in one blow.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.431
Makes sense.
Hacking off someone's head's...

09:27.500 --> 09:29.832
more like cutting down a small tree
than splitting a log.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.200
I find your imagery
both colorful and accurate.

09:32.271 --> 09:36.765
Thank you. Let me know when you've
narrowed down the weapon category.

09:36.842 --> 09:39.970
Dr. Saroyan? When you say
your mother visited you...

09:40.046 --> 09:43.174
She appeared... in my room.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.183
It was early evening.

09:45.251 --> 09:51.019
- And you were frightened?
- No. I felt... loved.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.025
- Dr. Brennan says that's impossible.
- What do you think?

09:55.628 --> 09:57.653
I think it would be wonderful
if it were possible.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.727
I found rust flakes on the neck
that were from hand-forged iron.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.736
- 18th century.
- You got it.

10:04.804 --> 10:09.707
- [Grunts]
- My God! A little warning, Zack.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.869
I don't usually announce
each phase of my experiments.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.880
- Yeah, maybe you should start.
- Nice follow-through, dude.

10:15.948 --> 10:18.075
<i>It doesn't look like</i>
<i>it was a machete.</i>

10:19.585 --> 10:23.419
Dibs on the next weapon.

10:23.489 --> 10:26.356
- Looks like you have this under control.
- <i>[Hodgins Grunts Loudly]</i>

10:26.425 --> 10:28.655
<i>Graham had a fellowship</i>
<i>at the school.</i>

10:28.728 --> 10:31.026
It was a free ride
worth about 30 grand a year.

10:31.097 --> 10:35.193
Brian, the other kid from the woods,
he applied for it and lost out to Graham.

10:35.267 --> 10:38.668
After Graham disappeared,
the fellowship went to Brian.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.831
Hmm?
Did you hear me?

10:40.906 --> 10:44.205
Yeah.
Doesn't look good for Brian Andrews.

10:44.276 --> 10:46.107
You okay?

10:46.178 --> 10:51.115
I... I wonder what my life
would've been like if Russ had raised me.

10:51.183 --> 10:53.117
Well, you know,
since he was a petty thief...

10:53.185 --> 10:55.915
you know,
in and out of jail all the time, I...

10:55.988 --> 10:58.616
I imagine it wouldn't
have been very good.

10:58.691 --> 11:02.024
If he'd accepted responsibility
for raising me...

11:02.094 --> 11:05.962
[Exhales Deeply]
I'm romanticizing. It's foolish.

11:06.032 --> 11:08.592
Everyone does it, Bones, okay?
It's normal.

11:08.668 --> 11:13.162
It's a useless fantasy, no different than
the childish legend about the headless woman.

11:13.239 --> 11:16.675
I mean, look at Will.
He sacrificed everything for his brother...

11:16.742 --> 11:18.710
and still couldn't save him.

11:18.778 --> 11:23.112
<i>By walking out,</i>
<i>maybe Russ gave me my life.</i>

11:23.182 --> 11:26.242
Well, you know, what Will said,
he was right. You turned out okay.

11:32.224 --> 11:34.715
- I'm going to have coffee with him.
- <i>Mmm.</i>

11:34.794 --> 11:38.230
- That was quick.
- He understands something
no one else I know does.

11:38.297 --> 11:41.755
<i>I mean, people need connection,</i>
<i>Booth, even me.</i>

11:41.834 --> 11:44.962
Obviously, you have one with Cam.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.164
- <i>So...</i>
- What?

11:47.239 --> 11:49.434
I thought you'd mention it.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.942
<i>I mean, isn't that what partners do?</i>

11:52.011 --> 11:54.912
- Tell each other about their lives?
- <i>Wait a second.</i>

11:54.980 --> 11:57.915
- Look, Bones, I...
- <i>Sorry.</i>

11:57.983 --> 12:02.420
I'm sorry. I forgot how self-conscious
you are talking about sex.

12:02.488 --> 12:06.117
I am not...
I'm...

12:08.094 --> 12:11.029
Graham was kind of the star at school,
so we all wanted to work with him.

12:11.097 --> 12:13.031
And he thought the legend was true?

12:13.099 --> 12:15.932
Said that Maggie Cinders
was talking to him in his dreams.

12:16.001 --> 12:19.266
She told him where
her head was buried.

12:19.338 --> 12:22.865
And you believed him too?

12:22.942 --> 12:24.933
Not at first.

12:27.079 --> 12:31.209
When we were out there
in the woods...

12:31.283 --> 12:33.217
Stuff like that doesn't happen.

12:33.285 --> 12:35.651
What kind of stuff?

12:35.721 --> 12:39.282
Chopping sounds.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.792
There... There was eyes
hanging on all the trees.

12:41.861 --> 12:45.729
<i>Something was moving out there</i>
<i>that wasn't us.</i>

12:45.798 --> 12:48.028
Look, I know what you're thinking.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.365
But you weren't out there.
Okay, Lori, she freaked.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.031
She took off into nowhere.

12:54.106 --> 12:57.371
And... that's when
we all got separated.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.377
Okay, look. The police report said...

12:59.445 --> 13:02.039
that you brought Lori out of the woods.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.914
When I found Lori, she was just
curled up on the ground shaking.

13:05.985 --> 13:09.318
So you took her out of the woods,
but you left Graham?

13:09.388 --> 13:12.915
I thought he had left us, okay?

13:12.992 --> 13:15.392
You don't get it
what it was like out there.

13:15.461 --> 13:20.228
His brother asked you to go on
the search with him, but you didn't go.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.233
<i>Why didn't you go?</i>

13:22.301 --> 13:24.292
I'm not proud of myself, okay?

13:26.238 --> 13:29.696
But I just couldn't go back out there.

13:29.775 --> 13:31.709
I couldn't.

13:31.777 --> 13:36.441
Uh, Lori seemed to have
disappeared from school.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.745
You wouldn't happen to know
where we can find her?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.718
I haven't seen her since that night.

13:40.786 --> 13:46.247
The last I heard,
she checked back into the psych ward.

13:50.563 --> 13:54.863
I checked back in because I couldn't sleep.
I haven't slept for days.

13:54.934 --> 13:57.129
Thanks for meeting with me, Lori.

13:57.203 --> 13:59.933
Sure.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.371
There's not much else to do in here.

14:02.441 --> 14:07.310
Hey, do you mind if I ask you
what happened that night in the woods?

14:07.379 --> 14:09.313
I've told the police everything.

14:09.381 --> 14:12.373
But Graham is the only one
that can make things right.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.950
He just got a little lost in there.

14:17.022 --> 14:20.048
But when he gets back,
he's gonna make sure that I'm safe again.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.593
Graham...
He promised to take care of you?

14:22.661 --> 14:25.425
Well, sure.
He's my boyfriend.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.488
He doesn't want anything
to happen to me.

14:27.566 --> 14:30.126
Your boyfriend?

14:32.638 --> 14:36.938
We keep it a secret.
Other girls get jealous.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.943
Everyone loves Graham.

14:41.180 --> 14:44.240
Did... Did you go into the woods?

14:44.316 --> 14:47.012
- Is that why you're here?
- Yeah.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.577
You found Graham?

14:49.655 --> 14:52.488
He said he was gonna talk to Maggie.
Is that where you found him?

14:52.558 --> 14:55.459
He wasn't with Maggie.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.297
No.

14:59.365 --> 15:02.232
N-N-No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:02.301 --> 15:06.601
- Lori? Lori, just calm down.
- She killed him.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.663
I'm sorry, Lori,
but we need to know what happened.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.006
- That's what happened!
- We need to know what happened to him.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.671
Did she take his head?

15:16.181 --> 15:19.014
Oh, God!
No!

15:19.084 --> 15:21.052
The blood!

15:21.120 --> 15:23.486
- I called for help, but Brian wasn't there!
- Relax.

15:23.555 --> 15:26.547
<i>Relax... Relax, Lori.</i>
<i>You're safe here.</i>

15:26.625 --> 15:29.458
There was so much blood!

15:29.528 --> 15:31.325
<i>[Sobbing Hysterically]</i>

15:31.397 --> 15:35.493
I tried to run! Graham!
Graham, she's coming! Run!

15:35.567 --> 15:39.469
<i>Graham! Graham!</i>

15:45.911 --> 15:49.677
She freaked, Bones. It was like she was
out there in the woods with that witch.

15:49.748 --> 15:52.512
Don't let anyone else hear you
talking like that, Booth.

15:52.584 --> 15:55.348
I'm just saying, you know,
I've seen a lot of weird things.

15:55.421 --> 15:58.322
It was like, you know,
<i>Exorcist</i> weird or <i>Elm Street</i> weird.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.551
- What are you talking about now?
- They're movies. Okay, Bones?

16:00.626 --> 16:04.653
- Movies so scary that
you end up peeing your pants.
- Good to know.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.164
I noticed some damage
to the subdeltoid bursa.

16:07.232 --> 16:09.826
Looks like the subscapularis
was torn away.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.837
<i>They're fracture lines.</i>
<i>This was a postmortem trauma.</i>

16:12.905 --> 16:14.566
Meaning what?

16:14.640 --> 16:17.575
The victim's shoulder was
dislocated just after his death.

16:17.643 --> 16:20.737
<i>The injury doesn't fit into</i>
<i>our established scenario of the struggle.</i>

16:21.914 --> 16:24.906
<i>These marks near</i>
<i>the vertebrocostal junction...</i>

16:24.984 --> 16:27.418
there's massive hinge fracturing.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.249
Zack, lie down on the ground.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.380
- Faceup or facedown?
- Faceup.

16:31.457 --> 16:35.484
- This should be good.
- And give me your right arm.

16:35.561 --> 16:41.090
Okay. If Graham Hastings was dragged
to the pit by this arm in this direction...

16:41.166 --> 16:45.034
the trauma to the back of his ribs
would result in hinging.

16:45.104 --> 16:46.696
<i>And the exposed wound</i>
<i>where the head was severed...</i>

16:46.772 --> 16:49.297
would've been collecting
particulates along the way.

16:49.375 --> 16:52.970
Tell Hodgins we might have enough for him
to determine where the victim was beheaded.

16:53.045 --> 16:54.979
Oh, yeah!
Double yeah.

16:55.047 --> 16:58.483
I'm waiting to hear from the psych ward
to see if we can talk to Lori again.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.484
Well, I'll ask Will
what type of relationship...

17:00.552 --> 17:03.715
Graham and Lori really had
when I have coffee with him.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.983
Wait a second. You know,
we're investigating his brother's death.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.992
Don't you think that
can get a little messy?

17:08.060 --> 17:11.621
I can compartmentalize... same as you.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.324
Mm-hmm.

17:13.398 --> 17:18.268
<i>The blood on those talisman things</i>
<i>hanging from the trees...not human.</i>

17:18.337 --> 17:21.636
I'll be back soon.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.641
I just wanna thank you
for everything you're doing...

17:23.709 --> 17:25.643
to find out
what happened to Graham.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.805
Is that why you called...
to thank me for doing my job?

17:28.881 --> 17:32.112
That and, uh...

17:32.184 --> 17:36.018
I didn't think you'd come,
so I guess I'm a little nervous.

17:36.088 --> 17:39.114
Caffeine affects the adenosine
receptors in the brain.

17:39.191 --> 17:43.093
- <i>It causes increased heart rate, so...</i>
- There are other causes.

17:44.997 --> 17:49.627
<i>My partner warned me</i>
<i>to stay focused on the case, so...</i>

17:49.701 --> 17:52.829
- If you got questions, that's cool.
- Okay, um...

17:52.905 --> 17:55.965
What kind of music do you like?

17:56.041 --> 17:58.202
That's a good question.

17:58.277 --> 18:02.441
Um... Snow Patrol.

18:02.514 --> 18:04.675
And Leonard Cohen.
I like Leonard Cohen.

18:04.750 --> 18:08.151
Gravel voice,
but somehow it's soothing.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.848
Yeah.
I wonder why that is.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.892
There's actually no empirical way
of assessing something like that.

18:13.959 --> 18:18.225
- But you didn't mean that literally, did you?
- Uh-uh.

18:18.297 --> 18:21.323
[Sighs]
I'm sorry. My...

18:21.400 --> 18:25.234
My social skills are very limited.

18:25.304 --> 18:27.738
<i>Trust me, they're fine.</i>

18:27.806 --> 18:30.070
<i>You know,</i> it...

18:30.142 --> 18:35.876
it took a long time for me to understand
how my brother could leave.

18:35.948 --> 18:40.908
And now, it's just as odd
to meet someone who stayed.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.977
I thought about leaving all the time.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.216
<i>I mean, I was a kid.</i>

18:45.290 --> 18:49.021
I didn't know how to be a parent.

18:49.094 --> 18:52.029
<i>I mean, I guess it was my fault</i>
<i>that his head got so big.</i>

18:52.097 --> 18:54.930
He was bossing people around
like he was already Steven Spielberg.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.934
Well, Graham couldn't have been all bad.

18:57.002 --> 19:01.871
- I mean, my partner says
that Lori seemed to love him.
- Poor kid.

19:01.940 --> 19:04.875
I liked her.
She deserved better.

19:04.943 --> 19:07.605
- Graham didn't treat her well?
- <i>No.</i>

19:07.679 --> 19:10.011
He juggled a lot of girls.
I don't know how he did it...

19:10.082 --> 19:12.710
- <i>but no one ever found out about each other.</i>
- So he cheated on her?

19:12.784 --> 19:15.446
Doesn't run in the family,
by the way.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.382
I have to get back to work.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.291
- Did I say something?
- Maybe.

19:22.361 --> 19:25.626
If I offended you in any way,
I'm sorry.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.289
Do you like Massive Attack?

19:27.366 --> 19:30.460
[Chuckles]
I don't know Massive Attack.

19:30.536 --> 19:34.905
Very impressive integration
of radical politics into their music.

19:34.973 --> 19:37.032
<i>I'll play 'em for you next time.</i>

19:42.114 --> 19:44.810
<i># [Rock, Indistinct]</i>

19:51.290 --> 19:53.224
[Screams]

19:53.292 --> 19:56.489
I know where
Graham Hastings was murdered.

19:56.562 --> 19:58.928
- <i># [Clicks Off]</i>
- Are you trying to kill me?

19:58.997 --> 20:01.056
What's with the music?

20:01.133 --> 20:05.001
It helps muffle the screams
so I don't pass out every few seconds.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.766
Smart. We have to go through
all the video again.

20:07.839 --> 20:11.775
Hastings was killed in a patch
of eastern hemlocks like this.

20:11.843 --> 20:14.243
<i>They grow in clusters</i>
<i>throughout the forest.</i>

20:14.313 --> 20:16.406
We have to spot the cluster
Graham and the others were near.

20:16.481 --> 20:19.416
Wait, wait.
We have to go through all the video again?

20:19.484 --> 20:22.419
Don't worry.
I'm right here for you.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.614
<i>[Graham]</i>
<i>There is no way that this is natural.</i>

20:24.690 --> 20:28.421
I mean, it's like... it's like
she left this here to guide us or something.

20:28.493 --> 20:31.951
<i>Make it stop!</i>
<i>Make</i> it... <i>Make it stop!</i>

20:32.030 --> 20:34.965
<i>[Brian] Graham, there's something</i>
<i>seriously wrong with Lori, okay?</i>

20:35.033 --> 20:37.092
- We should go back.
- No! This is...

20:37.169 --> 20:40.161
[Screaming]

20:40.239 --> 20:43.265
- <i>No! No!</i>
- <i>[Brian] What is it? Graham!</i>

20:43.342 --> 20:46.243
- <i>[Lori] Make it go away!</i>
- [Voices Overlapping]

20:46.311 --> 20:50.372
- Come on! Let's go!
- [Lori Sobbing] Graham, get back here!

20:50.449 --> 20:53.282
- <i>No, Graham!</i>
- <i>What are you doing? Let's get out ofhere!</i>

20:53.352 --> 20:55.616
<i>[Lori Screams]</i>

20:58.423 --> 21:02.359
Lori was not Graham's only girlfriend.
He had lots of girlfriends.

21:02.427 --> 21:05.658
But he somehow managed
to keep them secret from each other.

21:05.731 --> 21:09.861
- So what would happen if
a very jealous Lori found out?
- I don't know.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.130
- That's... That's more your territory.
- What?

21:12.204 --> 21:14.069
What, about cheating?

21:14.139 --> 21:17.336
I just meant that
you use psychology.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.468
<i>You're very touchy.</i>

21:19.544 --> 21:22.809
- Perhaps because of all your skulking around?
- <i>I am discreet.</i>

21:22.881 --> 21:27.181
Okay? It's different.
A gentleman is discreet. Okay?

21:27.252 --> 21:29.914
- <i>[Zack] What are we talking about?</i>
- Nothing that concerns you.

21:29.988 --> 21:32.218
- Booth.
- But I'm quite literally in
the middle of the conversation.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.225
And it seems very interesting.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.921
However, your glaring indicates that
I shouldn't press for further information.

21:36.995 --> 21:39.930
Mm-hmm. Good genius.
Yeah.

21:39.998 --> 21:43.764
<i>So, Lori loves Graham.</i>
<i>Thinks he loves her...</i>

21:43.835 --> 21:45.769
but finds out that he doesn't.

21:45.837 --> 21:49.830
So she goes all O.J. on him. It's a perfect cover,
right? "Headless witch did it, not me."

21:49.908 --> 21:52.274
The whole insanity thing
might be an act.

21:52.344 --> 21:55.108
<i>But the victim sustained</i>
<i>extensive defensive wounds.</i>

21:55.180 --> 21:57.580
This was a very powerful attacker.

21:57.649 --> 22:01.210
When a woman finds out that a man has been
cheating on her, she can get pretty mad.

22:03.121 --> 22:06.090
That's what I heard. Okay, look,
we got motive and opportunity. It fits.

22:06.158 --> 22:11.357
No, it doesn't fit.
Graham Hastings was 5'10" and 176 pounds.

22:11.430 --> 22:16.424
<i>Lori is 120 tops. The injuries aren't</i>
<i>consistent with a woman Lori Mueller's size.</i>

22:16.501 --> 22:20.028
<i>Of course, people on P.C.P. have been</i>
<i>known to exhibit extraordinary strength.</i>

22:20.105 --> 22:22.596
P.C. P?
Who was on P.C. P?

22:22.674 --> 22:26.041
Hodgins' report on the organic matter
from the baggie found at the scene...

22:26.111 --> 22:29.274
showed that it contained psilocybin
mushrooms injected with phencyclidine.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.578
Whoa.
What a trip.

22:31.650 --> 22:35.313
Well, if Lori ingested those, it's possible
she could've caused Graham's injuries.

22:35.387 --> 22:39.619
Not to mention combining dissociative
anesthetics with hallucinogenic compounds.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.319
It can have a devastating affect
on people with fragile brain chemistry.

22:42.394 --> 22:44.658
So her mental condition
is probably genuine.

22:44.730 --> 22:46.891
I'm gonna go talk to my buddy Brian
and see if he knows anything...

22:46.965 --> 22:50.765
about the magical mystery tour
that Lori might've been on that night.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.736
- If I could clear the forest...
- Then what?

22:57.809 --> 22:59.743
[Booth]
Hey, Brian.

22:59.811 --> 23:03.907
<i>Hey, Agent Booth.</i>
<i>This is Nate Gibbons, my film teacher.</i>

23:03.982 --> 23:05.973
This is Agent Booth.
I told you about him.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.144
Hello.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.744
Hi.

23:09.821 --> 23:11.652
- You're here about Graham Hastings?
- Yeah.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.816
Was he one of your students?

23:13.892 --> 23:18.454
Yes. He was, uh,
an incredibly gifted kid.

23:18.530 --> 23:22.364
<i>What happened out there</i>
<i>was horrible.</i>

23:22.434 --> 23:24.959
- Mmm.
- What are you doing here again?

23:25.036 --> 23:28.597
- You wanna find out what
happened to Graham, don't you?
- Of course.

23:28.673 --> 23:31.665
Yeah.
So what were we watching?

23:31.743 --> 23:33.677
- That's pretty cool.
- Nothing, really.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.805
It's this film I'm doing
for, uh, my degree.

23:36.882 --> 23:39.442
<i>Brian's being modest.</i>
<i>He wrote and directed...</i>

23:39.518 --> 23:42.817
an amazing modern take
on the Gilgamesh story.

23:42.888 --> 23:45.948
Nate produced it.
I got it accepted into Sundance.

23:46.024 --> 23:48.686
Oh. Congratulations.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.194
If you don't mind,
I'd like to talk to Brian alone.

23:52.697 --> 23:56.224
Sure.
We'll finish up later.

23:56.301 --> 23:58.235
All right.

24:00.472 --> 24:03.964
- Call me if you need anything.
- Mm-hmm.

24:11.716 --> 24:17.552
Brian, listen, we have evidence suggesting that
Lori was taking drugs that night in the woods.

24:17.622 --> 24:20.523
No.
Those woods are too thick.

24:20.592 --> 24:22.822
We knew that we had
to keep our heads on straight.

24:22.894 --> 24:27.228
<i>So as far as you know, Lori Mueller wasn't</i>
<i>under the influence of any hallucinogens?</i>

24:27.299 --> 24:29.699
- No.
- When she was with Graham, was she violent?

24:29.768 --> 24:32.396
- No way.
- Did you know that Graham was cheating on her?

24:32.471 --> 24:35.998
Man, that was none of my business.

24:36.074 --> 24:38.338
Sure, Graham was a hound,
and everyone knew it.

24:38.410 --> 24:41.868
Maybe Lori found out,
got angry with Graham.

24:41.947 --> 24:44.575
No, okay? There's no way.
It wasn't her, okay?

24:44.649 --> 24:46.617
Whacked out or not, it wasn't her.

24:49.955 --> 24:52.788
There was something else
out there that night.

24:56.261 --> 24:58.695
<i>[Lori]</i>
<i>Where are we going? I can't see.</i>

24:58.763 --> 25:01.323
[Brian]
Don't worry. Just stay close.

25:08.974 --> 25:10.908
What is that?

25:10.976 --> 25:14.002
<i>We're supposed to be looking</i>
<i>for eastern hemlock.</i>

25:14.079 --> 25:16.013
It's much more effective
with your eyes open.

25:16.081 --> 25:18.015
I just know what's gonna
happen here, okay?

25:18.083 --> 25:20.916
This is where they freak out
because they hear the witch.

25:22.387 --> 25:24.321
[Lori Screams]

25:24.389 --> 25:28.655
Wait. There.
Did you see that?

25:28.727 --> 25:30.592
Yeah. But where are they?
Go... Go forward.

25:32.597 --> 25:37.057
<i>Stop. Dense crown, fine branches,</i>
<i>scaly bark and wide ridges.</i>

25:37.135 --> 25:39.968
Those are eastern hemlocks.
Love your eyes.

25:40.038 --> 25:42.268
Now we need a landmark.

25:42.340 --> 25:46.140
You have to be quiet, okay?
There's something out there.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.338
No! No!

25:48.413 --> 25:50.472
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.676
[Speaking Backwards]

25:54.686 --> 25:57.018
<i>[Hodgins]</i>
<i>2:37 a.m.</i>

25:57.088 --> 26:00.057
- So?
- We have a date plus an exact time.

26:00.125 --> 26:04.027
<i>I can estimate the position of the moon</i>
<i>from shadowing patterns on the forest floor.</i>

26:04.095 --> 26:06.723
We should be able to get
the approximate latitude and longitude.

26:06.798 --> 26:09.460
- Yes.
- <i>[Brian] Graham, leave the camera!</i>

26:09.534 --> 26:12.162
- [Graham] What about Lori?
- [Lori Screams]

26:12.237 --> 26:15.434
Let's just work out
the coordinates.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.600
- Yeah.
- <i>[Lori Screams] Graham?</i>

26:17.676 --> 26:20.611
Graham?

26:23.081 --> 26:25.675
<i>The ax was found</i>
<i>buried over there.</i>

26:25.750 --> 26:28.776
Dried blood on the trunk.

26:28.853 --> 26:31.378
Whoa.

26:31.456 --> 26:34.391
<i>Make that a lot</i>
<i>of dried blood on the trunk.</i>

26:34.459 --> 26:36.359
Someone should do a scraping here.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.953
Where did you find the skull?

26:39.030 --> 26:40.895
Buried just beyond those bushes.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.558
But there's something else.

26:51.076 --> 26:54.637
<i>[Booth]</i>
<i>A second skull.</i>

26:54.713 --> 26:58.911
- <i>[Edison] I'm afraid so.</i>
- Are there any other
outstanding cases in the area?

26:58.984 --> 27:01.976
No, there aren't.

27:12.297 --> 27:14.231
Well, based on bony architecture...

27:14.299 --> 27:16.563
this skull's consistent
with that of Graham Hastings.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.603
<i>[Saroyan]</i>
<i>I'll confirm with the blood from the ax.</i>

27:18.670 --> 27:21.400
- And the other skull?
- Female. Mid-30s at the time of death.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.738
Which was between
the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries.

27:24.809 --> 27:28.404
You know, this ax handle is birch.
<i>Betula uber.</i>

27:28.480 --> 27:31.176
Same extinct species as
the wood fragments we found in the bone.

27:31.249 --> 27:33.114
I'm almost done with her face.

27:33.184 --> 27:36.517
<i>Why are you spending time on that?</i>
<i>It won't help the case.</i>

27:36.588 --> 27:38.556
Come on.
Let the kids have some fun, Mom.

27:38.623 --> 27:42.787
Both skulls have depressed fractures
on the parietal bones.

27:42.861 --> 27:45.386
They could've been killed with a blow
to the head before they were decapitated.

27:45.463 --> 27:47.522
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>In Graham's case, yes.</i>

27:47.599 --> 27:52.935
But on the female skull,
there's evidence of new growth.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.268
What looks like...

27:55.340 --> 27:57.399
This person underwent trepanation.

27:57.475 --> 27:59.875
An antiquated form of brain surgery.

27:59.944 --> 28:04.313
<i>Practiced in the 1700s</i>
<i>on those suspected of witchcraft.</i>

28:04.382 --> 28:07.215
- Do you think that skull is your Maggie Cinders?
- <i>[Hodgins] Of course not.</i>

28:07.285 --> 28:10.880
I mean, there's no way to know, right?
I'm just saying...

28:12.323 --> 28:14.450
it's interesting.

28:18.196 --> 28:22.496
Hey, Bones, you know those papers that
Hodgins found in Graham Hastings's backpack?

28:22.567 --> 28:25.593
- His hallucinogenic ramblings?
- Mm-hmm. You got it.

28:25.670 --> 28:29.663
They were written on the back
of pages from his screenplay.

28:29.741 --> 28:32.505
I don't see the significance.

28:32.577 --> 28:35.137
Graham was a film student.
Of course he wrote screenplays.

28:35.213 --> 28:39.274
Yeah, but this was a modern day take
on the Gilgamesh story.

28:39.350 --> 28:44.185
The same story that Brian Andrews
is using for his film.

28:44.255 --> 28:47.656
He stole Graham's screenplay.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.321
Yeah.
Look familiar?

28:51.396 --> 28:53.796
What...
Where'd you find these?

28:53.865 --> 28:56.834
Graham Hastings's backpack
near his murdered body.

28:56.901 --> 28:59.995
Care to explain why a movie
that's about to make it to Sundance...

29:00.071 --> 29:02.539
sounds a lot like the screenplay
that your dead buddy wrote?

29:02.607 --> 29:04.666
- Look, I know what you're thinking.
- <i>Oh, really?</i>

29:04.743 --> 29:09.339
- <i>Because what I think is that you killed him.</i>
- No.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.780
I think you're the one who drugged Lori
so she wouldn't know...

29:11.850 --> 29:14.683
- <i>what the hell was going on that night.</i>
- No, I didn't.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.551
<i>Look, I know that this may look similar,</i>
<i>but this is mine.</i>

29:17.622 --> 29:21.388
Really? Because, you know, we found
an e-mail on Graham's computer...

29:21.459 --> 29:24.895
sending you a complete
first version draft to you.

29:24.963 --> 29:28.956
- He wanted you to read it, get your thoughts.
- So, what'd you think?

29:29.033 --> 29:32.366
I thought...

29:32.437 --> 29:34.905
I thought that it was better
than anything I could ever write.

29:34.973 --> 29:38.033
So yeah, you know,
after Graham was missing a few months...

29:38.109 --> 29:40.373
Nate thought it would be safe
to pass off as our own.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.379
But I didn't kill Graham.

29:42.447 --> 29:45.314
Anything else you forget
to mention, Brian?

29:46.818 --> 29:49.582
<i>Oh, come on, Brian.</i>
<i>You love the movies, right?</i>

29:49.654 --> 29:53.181
So this is the time where
the innocent guy comes clean...

29:53.258 --> 29:55.749
or the guilty guy
asks for a lawyer.

29:56.961 --> 30:00.397
<i>Okay, so which movie is this gonna be?</i>

30:04.335 --> 30:06.326
That night...

30:08.439 --> 30:12.842
Lori... When... When I found her,
she was covered in blood.

30:12.911 --> 30:15.277
It wasn't hers.
I was afraid.

30:15.346 --> 30:18.281
- You think she killed Graham?
- It wasn't her fault though.

30:18.349 --> 30:22.410
She was nuts, okay? She said that
the blood just rained down on her.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.183
I wanted to protect her.

30:25.256 --> 30:27.918
So you got rid of the bloody clothing?

30:29.227 --> 30:34.130
I hid them in the woods.
They're still out there.

30:34.199 --> 30:37.225
- Okay, great. You can take us there.
- No!

30:37.302 --> 30:39.236
Look, I'll tell you what I remember...

30:39.304 --> 30:41.272
but I'm never going out there again.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.637
You can lock me up
for the rest of my life.

30:43.708 --> 30:46.802
I'm never going back out there.

30:49.647 --> 30:53.310
The kid said he hid her clothes
in a hollow log near a stream.

30:53.384 --> 30:57.184
Thanks. Angela looked at the video again.
Tell the forensic team...

30:57.255 --> 31:00.747
to fan out across the area
south-southwest of the cabin ruins.

31:00.825 --> 31:04.090
Did you hear that, Lou?
Yeah, south-southwest.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.722
Yeah, I know it gets cold
when the sun goes down, Lou.

31:06.798 --> 31:10.859
Well, you should've brought your blankie.
Just call me when you find her clothes.

31:10.935 --> 31:12.903
Man!

31:12.971 --> 31:15.735
[Sighs]
What?

31:15.807 --> 31:18.139
- He was being a baby.
- I didn't say anything.

31:18.209 --> 31:21.645
But you're looking at me
like I'm in trouble and you're a teacher.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.477
- You're very touchy lately, Booth.
- Look, Bones.

31:24.549 --> 31:27.450
I don't know why
I didn't tell you about Cam.

31:27.518 --> 31:30.180
- Did I mention Cam?
- I just didn't want it to get weird, I guess.

31:30.255 --> 31:32.723
Weird?

31:32.790 --> 31:36.988
We're partners, you know?
Together all the time, right?

31:37.061 --> 31:39.757
You're a woman, and I'm a man.

31:39.831 --> 31:43.164
And I never had a relationship
like this where we were...

31:43.234 --> 31:48.638
like two guys, except you're not,
you know, a guy.

31:48.706 --> 31:52.301
- Yeah.
- No. No, I'm not.

31:52.377 --> 31:57.440
Should I feel odd about
wanting to hang out with Will?

31:57.515 --> 31:59.449
No, of course not.
You know?

31:59.517 --> 32:04.318
Because essentially, I mean,
you're a guy like me, but not really.

32:04.389 --> 32:09.725
That would mean that to me,
you are essentially a woman.

32:11.396 --> 32:13.830
- Yeah, I can see that.
- No, no, no, no.

32:13.898 --> 32:16.196
I'd prefer not to be a woman
if you don't mind.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.167
- I'm merely trying to follow your reasoning.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

32:18.236 --> 32:20.727
Okay, fine. What do you say we just,
you know... We'll drop it for now.

32:20.805 --> 32:23.569
<i>Yeah, it's Booth.</i>
<i>They found the clothes.</i>

32:23.641 --> 32:25.632
- That was fast.
- Well, good work, Lou.

32:25.710 --> 32:30.545
All right, now you can come home
before all the monsters get you...

32:30.615 --> 32:33.675
Hmm. Hung up on me.
I thought it was funny.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.889
The blood from the ax
was from Graham Hastings.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.394
Okay, was the blood
on Lori Mueller's clothes a match?

32:43.461 --> 32:45.725
- Nope.
- Then there's another victim out there?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.890
Yes, and she's probably named Bessie.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.730
- Bessie?
- It's cows' blood.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.930
The hormones and antibiotics affirm
that it's from a butcher shop.

32:54.005 --> 32:58.237
Dr. Brennan, the witch's skull
was cut with a Stryker saw.

32:58.309 --> 33:01.335
<i>Wait.</i>
<i>Don't you use those in your autopsies?</i>

33:01.412 --> 33:03.346
<i>They're also used</i>
<i>in teaching institutions.</i>

33:03.414 --> 33:07.942
I found a faded serial number behind the
occipital condyle. It's from the university.

33:08.019 --> 33:11.455
So the skull was stolen
from the medical school.

33:11.522 --> 33:16.050
Someone set up one hell of a horror show
to kill Graham Hastings.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.859
- Have a seat.
- I'll help in any way I can...

33:24.936 --> 33:26.995
but I do have a class
starting in 45 minutes.

33:27.071 --> 33:30.734
Yeah, well, you know, it's film class.
Have 'em watch <i>Wedding Crashers.</i>

33:30.808 --> 33:35.074
I can assure you, Agent Booth, that
film class is a lot more than watching movies.

33:35.146 --> 33:37.205
Were you aware that
the medical school at the university...

33:37.281 --> 33:40.079
has an anatomical
specimen collection?

33:40.151 --> 33:44.611
I don't even know what that means.
This is about Graham, right?

33:44.689 --> 33:49.422
<i>The research collection can only be accessed</i>
<i>by a faculty member with a key card.</i>

33:49.494 --> 33:53.123
Yours was recorded entering
the building last November 7 th...

33:53.197 --> 33:56.496
three days before
Graham Hastings disappeared.

33:56.567 --> 34:00.298
You often go into a medical school
at 2:43 in the morning?

34:00.371 --> 34:02.999
I reported my card missing last November.
You'll find a record of that.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.440
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>It's convenient.</i>

34:05.510 --> 34:09.139
- Very convenient.
- Are you accusing me of something?

34:09.213 --> 34:12.739
<i>Someone stole a skull,</i>
<i>planted it in the woods...</i>

34:12.817 --> 34:16.116
<i>along with animal bones,</i>
<i>blood, weird amulets.</i>

34:16.187 --> 34:19.623
Tricking people into believing that
Graham was murdered by a ghost.

34:19.690 --> 34:24.684
Okay, but why? Why would I possibly
want to do something like that?

34:24.762 --> 34:28.858
- Ride his coattails, you know?
Escape the faculty ghetto.
- He shut you out.

34:28.933 --> 34:34.098
And maybe you were feeling just
a little bitter about that, huh, teach?

34:39.043 --> 34:41.476
I'm entitled to an attorney,
aren't I?

34:42.947 --> 34:46.246
<i>Okay, maybe it was Graham</i>
<i>who stole the skull himself.</i>

34:46.317 --> 34:50.344
Are you suggesting that it was
some convoluted suicide scheme?

34:50.420 --> 34:52.411
- He chopped off his own head?
- No.

34:52.489 --> 34:54.981
Look, I'm just saying things,
they got out of hand, right?

34:55.059 --> 34:57.323
He wanted to make it look
like a documentary, right?

34:57.395 --> 35:00.922
As scary as possible.
So he sets everything up, right?

35:00.998 --> 35:03.193
He gets Nate to
help him out that night.

35:03.267 --> 35:06.668
But Nate sees an opportunity.
No one knows he's out there.

35:06.737 --> 35:09.729
And before you know, it's chop-chop,
and "I'm going to Hollywood."

35:09.807 --> 35:12.867
I found someone else in the woods.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.037
<i>I think it's a person.</i>

35:15.113 --> 35:17.843
Have you finished with
the particulates from the ax handle?

35:17.915 --> 35:20.611
I've determined that the assailant
was wearing rough-hewn leather gloves.

35:20.685 --> 35:23.210
- But I still have to check.
- Then why are you in here?

35:23.287 --> 35:26.779
Because I want him here.
Okay, look.

35:26.858 --> 35:29.349
<i>I ran it through</i>
<i>a mass-recognition program.</i>

35:29.427 --> 35:33.488
That's Graham,
and that is our mystery guest.

35:33.564 --> 35:37.398
- It's not Brian?
- No. Different height and weight.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.561
<i>This person is about 6'1 ".</i>

35:39.637 --> 35:42.367
As you can see,
that includes a head.

35:43.674 --> 35:46.074
<i>So it's definitely not Maggie.</i>

35:46.144 --> 35:48.840
<i>Nate Gibbons is about 6'1 ".</i>

35:48.913 --> 35:52.576
<i>I'll ask Will ifhe can tell us</i>
<i>anything about Graham and his teacher.</i>

35:52.650 --> 35:54.641
<i>Maybe he threatened Graham.</i>

35:57.788 --> 36:00.052
[Lori Screaming]

36:00.258 --> 36:02.021
His professor?

36:02.093 --> 36:04.755
Did Graham tell you anything
about his relationship with him?

36:04.829 --> 36:08.890
He said the guy wanted to help produce his film.
Graham said he wanted to do it on his own.

36:08.966 --> 36:11.594
His professor is producing his film.

36:11.669 --> 36:14.035
Brian stole Graham's screenplay.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.198
He and the professor are making it.

36:16.274 --> 36:18.242
The teacher killed Graham
for a script?

36:18.309 --> 36:21.278
It would make his career.
Brian's too.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.575
I've seen people murdered
for a lot less.

36:23.648 --> 36:25.809
It's not certain yet.

36:25.883 --> 36:30.877
We're just looking for evidence that
links one or two of them to the remains.

36:35.359 --> 36:38.817
With all this going on,
when I'm with you...

36:41.365 --> 36:44.129
I feel like
everything's gonna be okay.

36:46.337 --> 36:48.931
I'd like to see the world
the way you do.

36:49.006 --> 36:52.407
Then you would be looking...

36:52.476 --> 36:55.240
at a very beautiful woman.

37:16.667 --> 37:20.034
<i>[Saroyan] Preliminary tests show</i>
<i>only one type of D.N.A. on the ax.</i>

37:20.104 --> 37:22.766
But now the follow-up tests
are showing two.

37:22.840 --> 37:26.606
- Something wrong with
our electrophoresis machine?
- No, I double-checked it.

37:26.677 --> 37:29.612
So this means you got
the killer's D.N.A.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.478
Right. The attacker must've been cut
by Graham during the struggle.

37:32.550 --> 37:35.212
<i>I'm trying to separate out</i>
<i>the two types of D.N.A., but it's hard.</i>

37:35.286 --> 37:39.017
It's easy. I'll just get a warrant
for a blood sample for Nate Gibbons.

37:39.090 --> 37:42.992
<i>The glove fragments on the handle</i>
<i>were coated with diammonium phosphate...</i>

37:43.060 --> 37:45.654
and a guar gum-derivative thickener.

37:45.730 --> 37:48.062
- Do you speak English?
- It's a flame retardant.

37:48.132 --> 37:52.899
<i>Exactly. Isn't that only used</i>
<i>by professional firefighters?</i>

37:52.970 --> 37:56.064
Wait.
Graham's brother is a firefighter.

37:56.140 --> 38:00.167
<i>He's also about 6'1 ", right?</i>
<i>And he has a head.</i>

38:00.244 --> 38:04.146
That explains why it looks like
there was only one blood source.

38:04.215 --> 38:06.683
Siblings share so many
of the same chromosomes.

38:06.751 --> 38:10.050
Will Hastings killed his brother.

38:10.121 --> 38:13.386
- That certainly explains my results.
- Brennan.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.425
Wait.
She's with him now.

38:17.595 --> 38:21.031
[Siren Wailing]

38:25.636 --> 38:28.605
- Good and funny.
- That's your opinion.

38:28.673 --> 38:31.665
I don't think you're the one
that should be telling me what...

38:31.742 --> 38:36.008
<i>Booth.</i>
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

38:36.080 --> 38:38.605
I'm sorry.

38:40.284 --> 38:43.219
- You're under arrest for
the murder of your brother.
- Wait. What?

38:43.287 --> 38:45.585
- You have the right to remain silent.
- What is this, Booth?

38:45.656 --> 38:48.591
He did it.
Cam found his blood on the ax...

38:48.659 --> 38:53.392
<i>and Hodgins found chemicals that</i>
<i>only a firefighter would have access to.</i>

38:53.464 --> 38:55.898
I didn't kill Graham.

38:55.966 --> 38:59.094
We fought. That's all.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.764
You were out there
in the woods that night?

39:01.839 --> 39:05.570
Please don't look at me like that.
Please? I was just helping my brother.

39:05.643 --> 39:07.474
He said the film
was gonna make him famous.

39:07.545 --> 39:10.878
<i>So you got the animal bones,</i>
<i>the blood...</i>

39:10.948 --> 39:12.813
<i>and you made the chopping sound</i>
<i>with the ax.</i>

39:12.883 --> 39:16.182
He wanted me to stay out of sight.

39:16.253 --> 39:18.778
But the girl... Lori...
he slipped her drugs.

39:18.856 --> 39:22.724
And she was screaming,
and I said I wasn't gonna help anymore.

39:22.793 --> 39:25.887
And I said I wouldn't throw
the blood on her, so he did it.

39:25.963 --> 39:28.932
And she went crazy, and you saw her.
Graham did that to her.

39:28.999 --> 39:32.332
- Will...
- I had to stop him, okay?

39:32.403 --> 39:35.463
<i>I can't be responsible for</i>
<i>raising a monster like that.</i>

39:35.539 --> 39:41.000
- So you hit him with the ax.
- He was just lying there and
I was waiting for him to move.

39:41.078 --> 39:45.742
And I've never... I've never even hit him before,
no matter how difficult he got.

39:45.816 --> 39:48.751
Then you chopped off his head and you buried
him to make it look like some witch did it.

39:48.819 --> 39:51.754
No.
She did it.

39:51.822 --> 39:56.316
She did it. Maggie Cinders
was out there that night...

39:56.394 --> 39:58.385
and she made me do it.

39:59.730 --> 40:03.928
She told me never to tell anybody.

40:04.001 --> 40:07.300
Maggie Cinders made me
cut off his head.

40:07.371 --> 40:10.033
That's the only way it could happen.

40:10.107 --> 40:14.271
You know me.
He was my brother.

40:14.345 --> 40:17.212
I could never kill my own brother.

40:17.281 --> 40:19.306
It was her!

40:29.226 --> 40:31.353
What are you waiting for, Booth?

40:31.429 --> 40:33.056
- You have the right to remain silent.
- No!

40:33.130 --> 40:35.963
You understand me?

40:36.033 --> 40:39.127
- <i>Anything you say...</i>
- No, please.

40:39.203 --> 40:42.832
- Wait, please.
- will be used against you in a court of law.

40:42.907 --> 40:45.637
You have the right to speak
to an attorney.

40:49.914 --> 40:54.248
<i>Yeah. The F.B.I. needs me to finish</i>
<i>cataloguing the restored footage.</i>

40:54.318 --> 40:57.913
It's cool.
I don't have anywhere else to go.

40:57.988 --> 41:00.786
You've been great today, Hodgins.

41:00.858 --> 41:04.419
I know.
I haven't seen that piece.

41:05.963 --> 41:08.488
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>Yeah, I was working on it before.</i>

41:08.566 --> 41:10.693
It just finished rendering.

41:22.179 --> 41:25.671
<i>Uh... Uh, it could...</i>
<i>could be a reflection.</i>

41:27.184 --> 41:29.948
- <i>[Hodgins] Had to be. Or some moonlight.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

41:30.020 --> 41:32.250
Uh, moonlight sounds right.

41:33.958 --> 41:37.792
<i>Can I stay at your place tonight?</i>

41:37.862 --> 41:40.763
Sure. No problem.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.396
<i># [Pop Ballad]</i>

41:50.541 --> 41:52.975
[Sighs]

41:57.381 --> 41:59.542
I sure know how to pick 'em, don't I?

42:00.985 --> 42:03.351
Well, you know.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.980
Our perceptions are always colored
by what we hope...

42:06.056 --> 42:08.217
and what we fear, what we love.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.960
We do the best we can.

42:13.464 --> 42:16.956
I'm afraid my best isn't good enough.

42:18.636 --> 42:21.628
I can read bones, not people.

42:21.705 --> 42:24.606
Well...

42:24.675 --> 42:26.973
You know, you had no trouble
seeing through me.

42:36.220 --> 42:39.519
- It's a good thing I like being alone.
- You know what? You're not alone.

42:39.590 --> 42:41.615
Okay? Come on.

42:44.094 --> 42:46.028
- Booth.
- Hey.

42:46.096 --> 42:49.259
You're my partner.
Okay?

42:49.333 --> 42:51.267
It's a guy hug.

42:53.003 --> 42:54.868
Take it.

42:59.276 --> 43:01.141
All right?

43:01.211 --> 43:05.011
<i># [Continues]</i>

43:14.491 --> 43:16.550
<i># [Ends]</i>

43:49.393 --> 43:50.758
What's that mean?
