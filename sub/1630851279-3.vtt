WEBVTT

00:00.633 --> 00:01.333
Bridal glitter here we come.

00:03.570 --> 00:05.371
There are two brides.

00:05.405 --> 00:07.239
What are your relationships?

00:08.775 --> 00:11.210
This is my husband
and this is my fiancee.

00:11.244 --> 00:12.478
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:12.512 --> 00:13.412
- [Kassandra] Yeah.
- Crazy.

00:13.446 --> 00:14.413
- [Kassandra] Yes.
- I know.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.648
Oh, my God.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.385
[Carly] Aww, you look beautiful.

00:19.419 --> 00:20.886
Finally back in
to see the dress.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.222
I'm so excited.
It's gonna look so good.

00:23.256 --> 00:25.190
- Ashley.
- Hi.

00:25.225 --> 00:28.327
Every bride who comes
into Kleinfeld is special.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.695
You're more special
than everybody.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.497
I don't know how to thank you.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.265
How does everybody
in New York thank you?

00:33.299 --> 00:36.435
There's somebody very special
who we would like you to meet.

00:36.469 --> 00:39.405
Oh, my God.

00:39.439 --> 00:42.207
- [woman] Oh, my gosh.
- [woman] Yeah.

00:42.242 --> 00:43.575
This is my number one.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.978
This has to be it.

00:46.012 --> 00:48.113
[Kassandra] So we're in
a little bit of a situation.

00:48.148 --> 00:49.581
[Candace] Oh.

00:49.616 --> 00:50.416
[Kassandra]
How much is this dress?

00:50.450 --> 00:52.384
$5,100.

00:52.419 --> 00:54.119
[Kassandra] Were you not
thinking about me?

00:54.154 --> 00:55.387
[Carly] It's...

00:55.422 --> 00:59.291
Do I let her have
most of the budget?

00:59.325 --> 01:01.260
What are you gonna do?

01:01.294 --> 01:03.328
- Pew.
- [Krissy] Oh, yes.

01:10.270 --> 01:13.272
[upbeat music playing]

01:14.307 --> 01:15.507
[woman] Welcome to Kleinfeld.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.342
[all] Huddle, huddle,
huddle, huddle.

01:17.377 --> 01:21.480
- [Kassandra] Let's go.
- [cheering]

01:21.514 --> 01:23.348
[singer]<i> ♪ Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah ♪</i>

01:23.383 --> 01:24.950
[producer speaking]

01:24.984 --> 01:27.419
- It's a great question.
- So that is a great question.

01:27.454 --> 01:29.455
How do we answer this?

01:29.489 --> 01:31.356
There are two brides.

01:31.391 --> 01:33.459
Yo, that one right there.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.260
Hold on a second.
Did you say two brides?

01:35.295 --> 01:36.261
- Two brides.
- No way.

01:36.296 --> 01:37.362
- Yeah.
- No, no.

01:37.397 --> 01:38.630
- Get out of here.
- What?

01:38.665 --> 01:39.431
- Yeah.
- Am I one of them?

01:39.466 --> 01:40.699
Surprise.

01:40.733 --> 01:43.335
I feel like two brides
at once is always fun.

01:43.369 --> 01:45.270
- Yes.
- We are in a throuple.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.306
- We are all in love.
- Yeah.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.341
We're in
a polyamorous relationship.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.043
Uh, I like the mesh over here.

01:51.077 --> 01:52.444
Is that... Is that
what it's called, mesh?

01:52.479 --> 01:53.645
Mesh. Yeah, you're right.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.347
So one man
who has multiple wives

01:55.381 --> 01:56.515
- is usually polygamy.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:56.549 --> 01:57.616
Polyamory is when
multiple people

01:57.650 --> 01:59.351
have more than one love.

01:59.385 --> 02:00.652
You are just as equally loved.

02:00.687 --> 02:03.589
Yeah. I mean,
we sleep in the same bed.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.190
That means double the cuddles.

02:05.225 --> 02:06.792
- Yeah.
- [Carly speaking]

02:06.826 --> 02:09.495
I'm kind of digging
this whole, uh...

02:09.529 --> 02:12.131
- Ooh.
- ...diamond kind of look.

02:12.165 --> 02:14.633
Love comes in definitely a lot
of different forms, right?

02:14.667 --> 02:18.303
I'm married to Pao and, uh,
going on nine years.

02:18.338 --> 02:20.272
[Paoulo]<i> In 2016</i>
<i>is when we started</i>

02:20.306 --> 02:21.473
<i>to explore and get curious.</i>

02:21.508 --> 02:23.675
We actually decided to explore

02:23.710 --> 02:24.877
what an open marriage
would look like.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.513
[Paoulo]<i> It was a combination</i>
<i>of curiosity</i>

02:27.547 --> 02:29.381
<i>and just evolving in our love.</i>

02:29.415 --> 02:32.284
Um, two years later,
we met Carly.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.619
Me. Me.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.487
[singer] <i>♪ Your love is a risk ♪</i>

02:35.522 --> 02:38.724
<i>♪ One that I'd wanna take ♪</i>

02:38.758 --> 02:42.628
I fell in love with her
and I fell in love with him.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.496
You know, I didn't think
it was possible

02:44.531 --> 02:46.732
to love two people
at the same time

02:46.766 --> 02:48.700
but it is, it happened to me.

02:48.735 --> 02:50.602
Here it goes.
The magical question.

02:50.637 --> 02:52.571
- [Carly] Oh, my God.
- Will you marry us?

02:52.605 --> 02:55.073
[Kassandra] Will you marry us?

02:55.108 --> 02:56.575
[Carly] Yes.

02:56.609 --> 02:57.643
[Kassandra] She said yes.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.478
- I said yes.
- She said yes.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.480
[Paoulo] Yeah.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.215
I love you.

03:05.552 --> 03:07.152
- It's crazy.
- [Kassandra] Yeah.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.387
I know.

03:08.421 --> 03:09.688
Okay. So wait, so wait, so wait.

03:09.722 --> 03:12.524
What if we did a theme
like a royalty theme?

03:12.559 --> 03:13.592
[Paoulo] Mmm.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.093
[Krissy] Let's do this, Candace.

03:15.128 --> 03:15.627
Let's do it.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.196
Let's go get our brides.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.497
Oh, oh, oh.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.698
[Candace] You think
they're gonna want

03:19.732 --> 03:21.767
matching dresses
like something similar

03:21.801 --> 03:23.502
or do you think they're gonna
want completely different?

03:23.536 --> 03:25.370
- [Krissy] I don't know.
- [Paoulo] Ready. Three...

03:25.405 --> 03:26.238
- Hello, queen.
- ...two, one.

03:26.272 --> 03:27.272
Hey, so cute.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.440
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:28.474 --> 03:29.741
- [Paoulo] Hey, guys.
- Welcome.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.343
- [Kassandra] Hello.
- You look so cute.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.578
Hello.

03:32.612 --> 03:34.446
- You're our beautiful brides.
- [Krissy] Yes.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.248
- [Carly] Thank you.
- Which one of you is Carly?

03:36.282 --> 03:37.716
- That's me.
- [Candace] Okay.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.284
- And you must be Kassandra?
- Yes.

03:39.319 --> 03:40.519
And you are?

03:40.553 --> 03:41.687
[Paoulo]
I don't wanna steal the show.

03:41.721 --> 03:42.688
Paoulo. How are you guys?

03:42.722 --> 03:44.556
[Candace] Very nice to meet you.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.391
- [Paoulo] Nice to meet you.
- [Krissy] Nice to meet you.

03:46.426 --> 03:47.559
Paoulo. Nice to meet you.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.595
So now,
what are your relationships?

03:49.629 --> 03:52.764
We obviously understand, um,
that this kind of dynamic

03:52.799 --> 03:54.866
- is not for everyone, um...
- Mmm-hmm.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.336
...but we just hope
that even if they don't

03:57.370 --> 03:58.470
understand that at least

03:58.504 --> 04:01.406
they can respect
the relationship.

04:01.441 --> 04:03.275
- You okay?
- Oh, my gosh. Okay.

04:03.309 --> 04:04.610
Let's do this. Okay.

04:04.644 --> 04:07.346
So, this is my husband
and this is my fiancee.

04:10.216 --> 04:11.316
- Wow.
- Wow.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.517
- [Kassandra] Yeah.
- Okay.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.219
- Okay. Oh, wow.
- Yes, I know.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.420
Okay. I know.

04:15.455 --> 04:17.289
I didn't wanna scare you guys
but that's what [indistinct]

04:17.323 --> 04:18.857
- Scare? No.
- No.

04:18.891 --> 04:19.625
- [Krissy] Oh.
- [Candace] No one's scared.

04:19.659 --> 04:21.393
- We're ready.
- Yeah. Yeah.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.528
Listen, it's 2021,
anything can happen.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.430
[Eunice] I think as parents,
in the beginning,

04:25.465 --> 04:27.633
it's hard to wrap
your mind around it.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.435
Yeah. I'm all there now
but it wasn't like that

04:30.470 --> 04:31.603
- in the beginning.
- [Candace] Yeah.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.472
It took me some time.

04:33.506 --> 04:35.340
It took me the longest
out of all the parents.

04:35.375 --> 04:39.478
Uh, I took it kind of rough
for a good few years

04:39.512 --> 04:41.546
until then I saw it
with my own eyes

04:41.581 --> 04:44.449
and I realized
this is true love.

04:44.484 --> 04:45.784
<i>This is what love is.</i>

04:45.818 --> 04:48.453
That's the avenue
and the path that we've taken.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.555
We're supporting
our children regardless.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.357
- [Krissy] It's all about love.
- It's all about love.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.226
- [Krissy] Yeah.
- Damn.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.396
[Krissy] Now,
important question...

04:57.430 --> 04:59.598
- [Candace] Mmm-hmm.
- ...when is the wedding?

04:59.632 --> 05:00.465
- [Kassandra] Next year.
- Okay.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.566
That's as far
as we got planned though.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.602
- Okay.
- Yeah.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.803
So we haven't planned
anything else.

05:04.837 --> 05:07.739
Right now, we, um, can't get
legally married in our state.

05:07.774 --> 05:08.707
There are certain states
in America

05:08.741 --> 05:10.509
that do allow it
and it is a thought.

05:10.543 --> 05:12.010
But right now, we're just
gonna celebrate our love

05:12.045 --> 05:13.512
in front of our friends
and family.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.391
Exactly. Yeah.
That's what matters.

05:15.415 --> 05:16.548
So are you ladies ready?

05:16.582 --> 05:18.450
- Yes.
- Yes. Yes.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.118
- Are you ladies ready?
- [Kassandra] Yes, let's do it.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.553
[Carly] It's a nice sunny day,
go enjoy the city.

05:21.587 --> 05:22.721
- Mmm-hmm.
- Really?

05:22.755 --> 05:24.323
[Carly] And we'll see you later.

05:24.357 --> 05:25.590
Get yourself a slice of pizza.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.426
- Okay? There you go.
- [Carly] I love you.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.794
- [Paoulo] I love you, guys.
- [woman] Aww.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.562
- [Paoulo] I love you, guys.
- [Kassandra] All right.

05:30.596 --> 05:31.596
- Enjoy.
- Love you, guys.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.732
- [woman] Bye.
- Let's do it.

05:33.766 --> 05:39.638
[Carly]<i> So today, our budget</i>
<i>is $8,000 for both of us.</i>

05:39.672 --> 05:41.440
[Kassandra speaking]

05:41.474 --> 05:42.841
Um, where'd you...
where'd you hear that?

05:42.875 --> 05:44.743
Uh, because... Um, that's...
I got the wrong memo?

05:44.777 --> 05:47.346
Babe, this is a team here.
We. We.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.047
[Krissy] Carly,
you'll be with me here.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.350
[Candace] And Kassandra,
you'll be here with me.

05:51.384 --> 05:52.918
Yay.

05:52.952 --> 05:54.319
Just don't go over budget, babe,

05:54.354 --> 05:55.487
because she tends to do this
at home.

05:55.521 --> 05:57.322
Mmm-hmm. I'll try.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.691
If you ask who's the biggest
spender between us three.

05:59.726 --> 06:02.327
But wait.
Actually, big question,

06:02.362 --> 06:03.595
like you guys are okay

06:03.629 --> 06:05.063
seeing each other's dresses,
right?

06:05.098 --> 06:06.498
- Oh, yeah, I am.
- We are. I'm okay.

06:06.532 --> 06:07.699
Yeah, we're okay
with seeing each other's.

06:07.734 --> 06:09.334
Okay. So the big surprise
is for him?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.802
[Carly] Yeah.

06:10.837 --> 06:12.704
[Krissy] Is there a certain
look that you're going for?

06:12.738 --> 06:14.706
I do want something
that's form-fitted for sure,

06:14.741 --> 06:17.442
you know, like, you know,
I have to show the curves,

06:17.477 --> 06:18.677
- has to be like...
- Yeah.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.412
Do you feel
like she's gonna have

06:20.446 --> 06:22.547
a similar style to you,
Kassandra?

06:22.582 --> 06:24.850
Well, I do know
that she is going

06:24.884 --> 06:28.220
for something a little bit
more on the simple side.

06:28.254 --> 06:30.088
Okay.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.456
So I mean, the thing is
I got married before, right?

06:31.491 --> 06:33.458
And so,
this is her first wedding.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.760
Oh.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.528
So I definitely want her
to have more of that,

06:36.562 --> 06:38.296
- like, wow factor.
- [Candace] Mmm-hmm.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.332
I still wanted to be wow for me,

06:40.366 --> 06:41.867
um, but I'm definitely
gonna take

06:41.901 --> 06:43.502
a more simple approach,
more just like form-fitted,

06:43.536 --> 06:44.903
- maybe mermaid.
- Definitely married.

06:44.937 --> 06:46.772
I think... I think... Yeah.
I think... Yeah, right.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.507
- You feel me?
- Yeah, definitely mermaid.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.142
I'm just so curious.
How did you guys meet?

06:50.176 --> 06:54.613
We met just at a party
and like we've had

06:54.647 --> 06:56.448
like an instant chemistry.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.717
Kass and I did, kind of,
evolve into like

06:58.751 --> 07:01.620
a friendship first
and then it became

07:01.654 --> 07:03.388
the three of us kind of thing.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.457
Wow. Honestly,
this is a first for me.

07:05.491 --> 07:09.628
I come from a family of like
old school like Italian,

07:09.662 --> 07:11.730
so it's different,
and it's exciting,

07:11.764 --> 07:13.899
and it's new,
and they're in love.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.335
I mean, she stressed it to me,
like they're so in love.

07:17.370 --> 07:19.037

[Candace] Oh,

07:34.654 --> 07:36.588
I don't know
if she would like the color.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.458
- But I love the detail in it.
- [Candace] Yeah, the details.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.359

I'mma put these on hold.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.498
I have like already one dress
that I think

07:46.532 --> 07:47.866
is gonna be like the superstar.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.701
I just have to make sure
Candace isn't thinking

07:49.735 --> 07:52.404
of that dress too
because that wouldn't be good.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.474
- Hey, girl.

08:04.383 --> 08:06.351
So I'm staying at $3,000

08:06.385 --> 08:08.487
to kind of give Carly
more of a budget.

08:08.521 --> 08:09.821
I'm staying
like $3,000 and under.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.501

08:27.473 --> 08:28.673
[Candace] I brought
the whole closet over.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.308
Why did I think you were
just gonna bring

08:30.343 --> 08:31.409
- like one at a time?
- [Candace] Yeah.

08:31.444 --> 08:32.577
No, not my forte.

08:32.612 --> 08:33.578
- Yeah.
- [Candace] Not at all.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.413
So I have these four looks.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.948
Oh, my gosh.

08:36.983 --> 08:38.517
[Candace] So we're

[Kassandra] Oh, my gosh.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.455
This one is Pronovias.
It's called Ermin.

08:43.489 --> 08:45.156
[Kassandra] Okay.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.591
[Candace] And I kept
the budget a little lower.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.660
So... Because I know
as we discussed...

08:48.694 --> 08:50.328

Oh, I hear something.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.244

09:10.650 --> 09:12.317
Oh, I can't wait to see them.

09:12.351 --> 09:13.885
Uh, this is Tony Ward Couture.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.555
He's one of my favorite
designers in the store.

09:16.589 --> 09:17.789
He's from Lebanon.

09:17.823 --> 09:20.358
I've got
some long train here for you.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.693
[Carly] Okay. Oh, wow.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.395
[Krissy] Isn't that beautiful?

09:23.429 --> 09:25.864
That's beautiful. Yeah.
I love this, um, top.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.132
[Krissy] It's gonna look
so good on you.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.233
[Carly] Yeah.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.536
[Kassandra] This is nice.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.804
[Candace] So what do you think
about this one?

09:32.838 --> 09:34.472
[Kassandra]
I'm feeling this one. Hey.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.473
- This is Pronovias, yes.
- Hey.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.775
Shows all the curves.

09:36.809 --> 09:39.678
It gives you
that sweetheart neckline.

09:39.712 --> 09:42.581
Soft lace at the bottom,
it has this nice long train.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.282
Look at that.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.084
So I'm giving you
a little drama.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.588
[Carly] Oh, my goodness.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.356
This is stunning.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.392
You hear, this is stunning?

09:54.427 --> 09:55.694
Can I see the stunning?

09:55.728 --> 09:58.830
I feel beautiful
in this dress. Wow.

09:58.864 --> 10:00.332
[Candace] You look beautiful
in this dress.

10:00.366 --> 10:01.766
[Carly] Oh, my gosh.

10:01.801 --> 10:05.303
This is beautiful.
Oh, my goodness, Krissy.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.038
[Krissy] Right?

10:07.073 --> 10:08.573
I didn't think
that I would love the shape

10:08.608 --> 10:10.742
and the style as much as I do.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.310
- Yeah.
- I love this.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.479
I can't wait to show the family

10:14.513 --> 10:15.714
and see what they think.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.716
I didn't think
that the first dress

10:17.750 --> 10:20.785
that I tried on would feel
like it's my dream dress.

10:20.820 --> 10:25.223
I have chills
and I have butterflies.

10:25.257 --> 10:26.958
So exciting.

10:26.993 --> 10:30.261
And I'm just thinking,
could this be the one?

10:30.296 --> 10:31.429
Could this really be the one?

10:31.464 --> 10:33.231
'Cause it feels like it.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.066
[Fanny] Uh, Carly.

10:37.503 --> 10:39.537
- [Candace] Ooh.
- [Kassandra] Do you hear that?

10:39.572 --> 10:41.406
- Ooh.
- Is it cute or what?

10:41.440 --> 10:43.608
- [Candace] I don't know.
- I wanna see this ooh.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.277
How beautiful is this dress?

10:46.312 --> 10:49.180
Oh, my God, Carly.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.082
No fair.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.452
- Ashley.
- Hi.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.522
Somebody very special
who we would like you to meet.

10:57.556 --> 10:58.790
Oh, my God.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.660
<i>Hello beautiful, Ashley.
How are you?</i>

11:01.694 --> 11:04.663
Like, can you see me
at the altar

11:04.697 --> 11:06.698
coming down in this dress?

11:06.732 --> 11:09.100
I'm not feeling it just yet.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.974
[upbeat music playing]

11:19.345 --> 11:21.079
Love it.

11:24.550 --> 11:25.717
- [Katelyn] Dorothy.
- [Dorothy] Hey.

11:25.751 --> 11:27.252
I have Randy on the phone.

11:27.286 --> 11:28.353
Oh, great. Thanks, Katelyn.

11:28.387 --> 11:29.854
- Yeah.
- Thanks, honey.

11:29.889 --> 11:31.389
- Hi, Randy.
- Hey, gorgeous.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.191
<i>- How are you?</i>
- What's going on back there?

11:33.225 --> 11:34.592
[Randy laughs]

11:34.627 --> 11:38.296
They're putting in the floors
in my master bath.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.598
- What do you think?
- [Dorothy] Oh, my goodness.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.835
Oh wow, you got a nice mess
on your hands, I see.

11:43.869 --> 11:47.439
Yeah. It's quite the thing
and they've been doing a lot

11:47.473 --> 11:49.774
of banging and...
Yeah, let me move out here

11:49.809 --> 11:53.378
so I can hear you actually
because it's so much going on.

11:53.412 --> 11:58.416
So, um, congratulations,
I hear you're engaged.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.718
Thank you.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.753
So, what are you gonna do
about the wedding dress?

12:01.787 --> 12:03.588
[Dorothy]<i> I don't really know</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do.</i>

12:03.622 --> 12:05.490
Uh, we were thinking
of destination wedding,

12:05.524 --> 12:07.392
so whatever it's gonna be,
it's gonna be something light

12:07.426 --> 12:09.160
and flowy and whatever.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.595
Uh, I have no idea.

12:10.629 --> 12:12.497
I've known
you for over 30 years.

12:12.531 --> 12:15.333
I don't think I've ever
seen you in a dress, have I?

12:15.367 --> 12:16.568
[Dorothy] <i>No, I don't think so.</i>

12:16.602 --> 12:19.304
I'm such a non-dress person.

12:19.338 --> 12:21.539
Anyway, I know you're busy
and I know you have a lot

12:21.574 --> 12:23.241
of noise going on
in the background,

12:23.275 --> 12:24.809
but there's a bride,
special bride of Ronnie's

12:24.844 --> 12:27.445
that's having a fitting today
and if you could just take

12:27.480 --> 12:29.481
two minutes just to say hello,

12:29.515 --> 12:31.583
<i>Ronnie would really
appreciate it.</i>

12:31.617 --> 12:33.551
Absolutely anything for Ronnie.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.719
[Dorothy]<i> Thank you. Thank you.</i>

12:34.787 --> 12:36.421
And for you guys
and for the bride.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.323
- Bye, Randy.
- [Randy]<i> Bye.</i>

12:38.357 --> 12:40.458
I'll see you. Mwah.
Bye-bye, honey.

12:40.493 --> 12:43.995
[upbeat music playing]

12:47.633 --> 12:50.468
- [screams]
- Oh my God.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.903
Bella, bella.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.404
[Carly] How beautiful
is this dress?

12:53.439 --> 12:55.640
Oh my God, Carly.

12:55.674 --> 12:57.375
Oh my gosh, I could tell
by your reactions

12:57.409 --> 12:58.676
- that this dress is like...
- [laughs]

12:58.711 --> 13:01.212
So, oh, we got the tissues.

13:01.247 --> 13:03.314
Whoa.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.750
- Do you hear that?
- Yes. [laughs]

13:05.785 --> 13:08.253
- Is it cute or what? Like I...
- [Candace] I don't know.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.587
I wanna see this ooh.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.457
My first dress
has a lot of potential,

13:12.491 --> 13:14.526
<i>but I'm literally standing there</i>

13:14.560 --> 13:17.295
and hearing everyone go,
"Oh my gosh,"

13:17.329 --> 13:18.696
so stunning, she's perfect.

13:18.731 --> 13:22.100
"She's beautiful." I need...
I wanna see this beauty.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.270
Isn't this dress beautiful?

13:25.304 --> 13:27.205
- Yeah, mom?
- Yeah, baby.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.207
[Carly] Aww, I love you.

13:30.442 --> 13:33.411
<i>I... This is so...
This is stunning.</i>

13:33.445 --> 13:35.180
<i>This is stunning.</i>

13:37.583 --> 13:39.751
Oh my God, you guys
are all getting emotional.

13:39.785 --> 13:42.453
- [laughs]
- Aww, I love you guys.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.189
- [Eunice] You are gorgeous.
- [Carly] Thank you.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.957
Absolutely gorgeous.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.560
- Amazing.
- [Eunice] This dress...

13:48.594 --> 13:50.261
[Fanny]<i> Oh, my God.</i>

13:50.296 --> 13:51.596
[Eunice] <i>...will probably be it.</i>

13:51.630 --> 13:53.331
[Fanny]<i> I feel</i>
<i>like that one's it.</i>

13:53.365 --> 13:54.732
- The-the-the body...
- It's forming.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.568
- ...the-the-the... Yes.
- [Eunice] It's open to the...

13:56.602 --> 13:58.670
[Fanny] The train, everything.

13:58.704 --> 14:00.305
[Krissy] What I love about this

14:00.339 --> 14:01.706
is it has that beautiful plunge

14:01.740 --> 14:03.508
- we were talking about.
- [Fanny] Yes. Mmm-hmm.

14:03.542 --> 14:04.609
[Krissy] And it just
elongates here.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.544
And the English net,
the ruching.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.546
And what I love about the bottom

14:08.581 --> 14:11.316
is it's just like
a little extra,

14:11.350 --> 14:12.417
like not so tight at the bottom.

14:12.451 --> 14:13.885
Exactly.

14:13.919 --> 14:14.652
[Krissy] It's the best
of both worlds.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.287
Ahh, thank you
for making me feel

14:16.322 --> 14:19.457
like just so beautiful.

14:19.491 --> 14:21.593
So now I know, like,
if the next dress

14:21.627 --> 14:23.094
doesn't make you cry, then...

14:23.128 --> 14:24.562
[laughs]

14:24.597 --> 14:26.331
You know what I mean?

14:27.566 --> 14:29.511
And you would wear like a...

14:29.535 --> 14:32.604
[Carly] I don't think you wear
a veil with this, do you?

14:32.638 --> 14:34.405
Hello, hello, hello.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.374
- Hi.
- [woman] Hello.

14:36.408 --> 14:38.076
- [Eunice] Hi, honey.
- Wow.

14:38.110 --> 14:40.411
Oh my God.

14:40.446 --> 14:41.646
[Carly] Aww, you look beautiful.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.348
[Kassandra] You look beautiful.

14:43.382 --> 14:44.349
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.650
[Carly] Stop.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.452
- [Krissy] This is stunning.
- [Carly] You love it?

14:47.486 --> 14:49.320
I love it. You look amazing.

14:49.355 --> 14:50.788
[Carly] Aww, I love this
and so do you.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.791
I love that our dresses
like mesh so well.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.760
They complement each other
very well, you know.

14:55.794 --> 14:58.796
[Krissy] Like, yours is like
the perfect amount of bottom.

14:58.831 --> 15:01.532
Yours is just a tiny bit extra.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.234
- [Carly] Wow.
- I just wanna tackle you.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.502
- Yeah.
- [laughter]

15:04.536 --> 15:06.104
- [Krissy] Aww.
- [woman] Here.

15:07.106 --> 15:08.473
- Let's move the train for you.
- [laughter]

15:08.507 --> 15:09.607
[Carly] I don't think
that's possible.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.509
- Air hug.
- [laughter]

15:11.543 --> 15:13.378
- [Carly] We look good.
- [Kassandra] We look good.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.780
- Like, who these brides?
- [laughs]

15:15.814 --> 15:17.782
- Your reaction set everything.
- Oh, God.

15:17.816 --> 15:19.684
Yeah, yeah.
I couldn't even believe it.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.686
<i>That to me really says a lot</i>

15:21.720 --> 15:25.590
and just confirmed the way
that I felt in that dress,

15:25.624 --> 15:28.092
so this is just insane.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.495
- That went well.
- Yeah.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.764
Honestly, I couldn't be
happier for you.

15:32.798 --> 15:36.267
It's very rare that everybody
is on the same page.

15:36.302 --> 15:37.669
[Kassandra speaking Spanish]

15:37.703 --> 15:39.537
[Eunice] This is...
This is completely different

15:39.571 --> 15:40.471
from your other dress.

15:40.506 --> 15:41.472
- [Kassandra] Yes.
- Yeah.

15:41.507 --> 15:42.740
[Kassandra]
Like, my first weeding.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.242
[Eunice]<i> Her first wedding.</i>
<i>This is...</i>

15:44.276 --> 15:45.610
<i>This is completely different
from her first dress.</i>

15:45.644 --> 15:47.211
[Kassandra] The other
one was poofy?

15:47.246 --> 15:48.446
- Yes.
- Yeah, it was poofy.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.416
It's Pronovias,
it's a very light bottom

15:51.450 --> 15:53.518
and it's all along some lace

15:53.552 --> 15:55.386
with a little bit beading
at the top.

15:55.421 --> 15:57.221
I think you look gorgeous in it.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.256
[Kassandra] Do you?

15:58.290 --> 15:59.324
- Stop, Erica.
- [Candace laughs]

15:59.358 --> 16:00.591
Stop it.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.260
[Eunice] How do you feel
in this dress?

16:02.294 --> 16:03.394
I feel really beautiful in it.

16:03.429 --> 16:04.796
Like, you know, just natural.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.731
I like the way that it really
like accentuates my curves.

16:06.765 --> 16:07.865
- Which is nice.
- It's so beautiful.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.634
[Kassandra] You know, but
I am open to more for sure.

16:09.668 --> 16:10.735
[Candace] Do you ladies
like the train?

16:10.769 --> 16:12.503
[Eunice] Yes, I do
love the train.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.572
<i>Her first dress I think is,</i>

16:14.606 --> 16:16.808
it's elegant, it's cute,

16:16.842 --> 16:17.742
but it didn't really...

16:17.776 --> 16:19.477
<i>It doesn't have that
wow factor for me.</i>

16:19.511 --> 16:21.012
[Kassandra]<i> I think</i>
<i>we're on the same page.</i>

16:21.046 --> 16:22.480
- [Carly]<i> We are.</i>
- [Kassandra]<i> In the same book.</i>

16:22.514 --> 16:23.648
I'm not feeling it just yet.

16:23.682 --> 16:25.483
[Candace] We have plenty
others in the room,

16:25.517 --> 16:27.285
so see you ladies when I start
to turn it up a notch.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.419
- [Eunice] Yes.
- [Erica] Yes.

16:28.454 --> 16:29.387
[Candace] And we will.

16:29.421 --> 16:30.521
[Kassandra]
We haven't turned it up.

16:30.556 --> 16:31.556
- [Candace] Yes.
- [Eunice] Yeah.

16:31.590 --> 16:32.790
Turn it up, turn it up.

16:32.825 --> 16:33.658
[Kassandra] Let's do it.

16:33.692 --> 16:34.759
[Candace] Okay.

16:34.793 --> 16:36.828
I think that next one
is really gonna knock it out.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.396
- [Kassandra] Do you think so?
- [Candace] Mmm-hmm.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.564
[Kassandra] Oh, snap.

16:39.598 --> 16:43.067
[upbeat music playing]

16:45.604 --> 16:47.705
[Randy]<i> Ronnie Rothstein.</i>
<i>How are you doing?</i>

16:47.740 --> 16:49.574
<i>- Good to see you.</i>
- Listen, I'm doing great.

16:49.608 --> 16:51.676
I see pretty...
Looks like pretty sketches

16:51.710 --> 16:53.845
in the back
of the next collection.

16:53.879 --> 16:55.480
Yup. I'm working on...
I'm working on my collection.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.581
- Yeah.
- [Ronnie]<i> We've got...</i>

16:56.615 --> 16:58.683
We've got a wonderful bride.

16:58.717 --> 17:01.819
<i>She worked in the ICU
when COVID broke out.</i>

17:01.854 --> 17:04.522
She was at the hottest spot
in America

17:04.556 --> 17:07.392
where more people was
suffering from COVID

17:07.426 --> 17:08.793
than any place
in the United States.

17:08.827 --> 17:12.430
She was busy really,
really helping people

17:12.464 --> 17:14.298
and Randy, she's still doing it.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.299
Wow.

17:15.334 --> 17:16.901
[dramatic music playing]

17:16.935 --> 17:19.737
It's the first nice day we've
had in New York in a while,

17:19.772 --> 17:22.473
so hopefully this is a good omen

17:22.508 --> 17:23.741
for a good dress fitting.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.477
Today is just about
the anniversary

17:26.512 --> 17:28.880
of when COVID really hit
New York hard

17:28.914 --> 17:31.649
<i>and it's crazy that
on the year anniversary,</i>

17:31.683 --> 17:34.318
I'm feeling very excited
to see my dress

17:34.353 --> 17:35.420
for the first time.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.722
<i>I never saw myself
here a year ago.</i>

17:37.756 --> 17:40.591
Thankfully, numbers
are going down substantially,

17:40.626 --> 17:43.594
there is a now vaccine,
so it's good.

17:43.629 --> 17:44.695
It's moving
in the right direction,

17:44.730 --> 17:46.764
I feel like it's just
in time for the wedding.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.466
Finally back in
to see the dress.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.935
I'm so excited.
It's gonna look so good.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.603
[Ashley] The last time
I saw my dress

17:52.638 --> 17:54.572
was about six months ago,
I think.

17:54.606 --> 17:55.673
[Dorothy] Hey.

17:55.707 --> 17:56.941
[Candace] First of all,
thank you for staying late.

17:56.975 --> 17:57.742
I have a bride here.

17:57.776 --> 18:00.545
Her friend wrote an email
to Ronnie.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.480
The bride is a doctor
during all this COVID.

18:02.514 --> 18:03.448
[Dorothy] Ooh.

18:03.482 --> 18:04.649
[Candace]<i> She'll probably</i>
<i>come tonight.</i>

18:04.683 --> 18:06.451
So I wrote an email to Ronnie

18:06.485 --> 18:08.152
because I know how much
of a fan Ashley is

18:08.187 --> 18:09.287
of this store Kleinfeld.

18:09.321 --> 18:10.555
<i>She needs this princess moment.</i>

18:10.589 --> 18:13.324
Oh my God.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.726
[Candace]
This is by Maison Signore.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.861
[Ashley] It's light, it's airy,

18:16.895 --> 18:19.564
<i>I can just see it
flowing around on the beach</i>

18:19.598 --> 18:21.399
and I'm really excited
about that.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.167
It's so pretty.

18:23.202 --> 18:24.702
Aww.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.537
[Dorothy] She's a hero to us.

18:26.572 --> 18:29.340
And Ronnie, it's his gift
to you, this dress.

18:29.374 --> 18:30.475
[Ashley] Oh my God.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.610
[Dorothy] So, I just want you
to know that, you know.

18:32.644 --> 18:33.678
[Ashley]<i> I was that</i>
<i>person that said</i>

18:33.712 --> 18:35.646
<i>I was never gonna cry
over a dress</i>

18:35.681 --> 18:36.681
<i>and I immediately,</i>

18:36.715 --> 18:39.417
<i>embarrassingly broke down
in tears</i>

18:39.451 --> 18:40.551
because it was
just such a moment

18:40.586 --> 18:42.420
that I didn't know
I was going to

18:42.454 --> 18:44.422
have that dream
of finding my dress,

18:44.456 --> 18:46.691
much less having it
gifted to me.

18:46.725 --> 18:51.429
[Candace and Dorothy] So, Ashley,
are you saying yes to the dress?

18:51.463 --> 18:53.297
- Yes.
- [all cheering]

18:53.332 --> 18:55.333
[applauses]

18:56.802 --> 18:58.503
It's a day I'm gonna remember
for the rest of my life

18:58.537 --> 18:59.770
and the dress that I found

18:59.838 --> 19:01.472
<i>is my dream dress
on top of that.</i>

19:01.507 --> 19:02.740
So Sam, you can sit.

19:02.774 --> 19:04.575
- [Samantha] Perfect.
- And we can go.

19:04.610 --> 19:07.245
- I'll see you in a second.
- Yes.

19:07.279 --> 19:08.946
My fiance's name is Josh

19:08.981 --> 19:11.549
and we've been together
for about three years now

19:11.583 --> 19:14.652
<i>and he is just the most
amazing person in the world.</i>

19:14.686 --> 19:17.488
His full-time job during
COVID was to take care of me.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.490
He did so much for this wedding.

19:19.525 --> 19:21.559
<i>He was the one that called
all the vendors</i>

19:21.593 --> 19:23.461
<i>while I was working.</i>

19:23.495 --> 19:25.830
His family jokes he's more
excited for this wedding.

19:25.864 --> 19:28.510
<i>The wedding is going to be
at The Crescent Beach Club</i>

19:28.534 --> 19:30.501
<i>in Bayville on the North
Shore of Long Island.</i>

19:30.536 --> 19:32.436
<i>Our backdrop is the ocean,</i>

19:32.471 --> 19:33.771
<i>that's gonna be
absolutely beautiful.</i>

19:33.805 --> 19:35.640
So the last thing I need
is my dress

19:35.674 --> 19:37.608
and I wanna see
what it looks like,

19:37.643 --> 19:39.644
I wanna see if it looks
as good as I remember it.

19:39.678 --> 19:43.080
I'm sure it will, but I can't
wait to try it on and get it all fit.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.418
[Fanny] This is a gown.

19:47.452 --> 19:49.420
- Oh my gosh, Carly.
- [Carly] Yeah?

19:49.454 --> 19:50.454
This is my number one.

19:50.489 --> 19:51.756
It's big.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.325
[Fanny] <i>This is my wedding, too.</i>

19:54.359 --> 19:55.359
[Carly] Really, mom?

19:55.394 --> 19:57.261
Yes, this is my pick.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.402
[upbeat music playing]

20:08.840 --> 20:10.975
[woman] How do you feel
about the shape?

20:11.009 --> 20:12.443
I do think I would like
to try something

20:12.477 --> 20:15.279
- a little more fitted.
- [woman] Okay.

20:15.314 --> 20:16.447
[Carly sighs]

20:16.481 --> 20:17.748
- That was magical.
- Right?

20:17.783 --> 20:19.617
- Yeah.
- That was a magic moment.

20:19.651 --> 20:21.686
I definitely didn't expect

20:21.720 --> 20:23.854
everyone to start crying
and get emotional,

20:23.889 --> 20:27.491
you know, that's how you know
that this dress is wow.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.327
Do you think Paoulo will cry?

20:29.361 --> 20:31.495
He might. I hope so.

20:31.530 --> 20:32.863
[upbeat music playing]

20:32.898 --> 20:35.233
Let's go check it out.
Let's see what we do.

20:36.868 --> 20:39.470
I'm walking around the city
waiting for the girls.

20:39.504 --> 20:41.239
I got some pizza.

20:41.273 --> 20:43.507
I watched a basketball game.

20:43.542 --> 20:44.709
All right.

[Krissy] So should
we try this next?

20:54.586 --> 20:56.354
I wanna say yes,

20:56.388 --> 20:57.755
but I don't know if I'm gonna
like this one more than...

20:57.789 --> 20:59.890
- [Krissy] Yeah.
- Than this one.

20:59.925 --> 21:00.725
You know what I mean?

21:00.759 --> 21:03.661
So we could do a quick
try on in here

21:03.695 --> 21:05.296
and if you don't love it,
take it out.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.330
[Carly] Okay, let's do that.

21:06.365 --> 21:07.431
- [Krissy] Okay.
- [Carly] Yeah, yeah.

[Krissy] Let's do it.

[Candace] I think we definitely

21:09.568 --> 21:12.036
should do this one,
the Martina Liana.

21:12.070 --> 21:14.338
I'm very excited to see
you on this one.

21:14.373 --> 21:15.439
- Let's pound it.

That's it. [laughs]

like spicy drama.

just a little like, wow.

21:24.650 --> 21:27.218
- Give me a little wow.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:27.252 --> 21:28.486
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.654
Okay.

21:30.722 --> 21:33.257
- Are you gonna take it up a step further?
- Yeah.

- [Kassandra] Okay.

Oh, yeah.

21:51.243 --> 21:52.510
[Fanny] I love it.

21:52.544 --> 21:55.413
Gorgeous.

21:55.447 --> 21:58.516
So this is the Martina Liana.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.584
Have the plunging neckline

22:00.619 --> 22:03.754
and it has a deep illusion on
the side with lots of beading.

22:03.789 --> 22:06.390
It has a little something on
the side that says peekaboo.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.726
- [laughs]
- Peekaboo, baby.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.629
So we turned it up
a lot with this one,

22:11.663 --> 22:14.632
keeping the same silhouette
and the long train,

22:14.666 --> 22:17.335
but it just adds a little bit
more of that glam.

22:17.369 --> 22:18.469
I love this one.

22:18.503 --> 22:19.670
I love this one
more than the first one.

22:19.705 --> 22:20.805
- [Kassandra] Yes.
- [Fanny] This one.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.574
Can the thing be removed or
it's kind of to keep it...

22:23.608 --> 22:27.278
[Candace] If we remove it, the
neckline is gonna be a little floppy.

22:27.312 --> 22:28.479
So we wanna keep it there

22:28.513 --> 22:29.780
because it keeps it all intact.

22:29.815 --> 22:30.748
- It's your tone, really.
- It's your tone.

22:30.782 --> 22:32.483
- I like that plunging.
- [Candace] Mmm-hmm.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.484
This is beautiful.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.152
[Kassandra]
And look at the back.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.520

has its wow, right?

22:42.327 --> 22:43.527
It has its wow factor

22:43.562 --> 22:45.696
and it also has its conservatism

22:45.731 --> 22:47.365
- you would wanna say.
- Mmm-hmm.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.667
That would allow for Carly

22:49.701 --> 22:52.503
to have her moment
in the ceremony

22:52.537 --> 22:53.838
because this is
her first ceremony.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.240
<i>I like them both
to have that moment</i>

22:56.274 --> 22:58.309
though and look awesome.

22:58.343 --> 22:59.276
Yeah.

22:59.311 --> 23:03.180
[Carly] Oh, I can't wait
to see her second dress.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.249
This is beautiful.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.553
You know, I think it's worth...

23:09.588 --> 23:10.755
[Krissy] Showing them?

23:10.789 --> 23:12.556
[Candace] I think
it's worth showing them.

23:12.591 --> 23:13.657
This one doesn't...

23:13.692 --> 23:15.726
It doesn't quite make me feel

23:15.761 --> 23:17.728
<i>like the other dress did,
you know?</i>

23:17.763 --> 23:20.731
<i>But I'm still gonna keep my,
you know, options open</i>

23:20.766 --> 23:23.401
and if they don't cry
in me in this dress,

23:23.435 --> 23:24.702
then I know that's not the one.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.437
And how does it feel
weight-wise?

23:26.471 --> 23:27.671
Is it light
or is it comfortable?

23:27.706 --> 23:29.373
It's not as light
as the first one...

23:29.408 --> 23:30.474
- but definitely comfortable.
- Hi.

23:30.509 --> 23:31.509
- Hi.
- [Kassandra] Ooh.

23:31.543 --> 23:33.611
[Kassandra] Hi, gorgeous.

23:33.645 --> 23:34.712
You look beautiful.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.480
[Kassandra] Look at this one.

23:36.515 --> 23:37.548
Okay, let me see this. Oh wow.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.550
Oh, this is really pretty.

23:39.584 --> 23:40.751
[Kassandra] Right?

23:40.786 --> 23:43.788
[Carly] Aww, you look amazing.
How do you feel in this one?

23:43.822 --> 23:45.723
I just... I'm really
digging this right here.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.526
Oh yeah, this is like
really really sexy.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.406
I do like this dress
more than the first one.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.430
[Kassandra] Same.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.799
[Carly] Um, you look...
you look beautiful in it.

23:54.833 --> 23:57.234
Yeah, it left way more
of an impression.

23:57.269 --> 23:58.602
- It did.
- Than the first one.

23:58.637 --> 23:59.904
How do we feel about this?

23:59.938 --> 24:02.573
[Kassandra] You look gorgeous.
Oh my goodness.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.475
- [Carly] Yeah?
- [Fanny] Yes.

24:04.509 --> 24:05.676
May I see the back?

24:05.710 --> 24:07.311
- Okay.
- The back is nice.

24:07.345 --> 24:08.412
[Kassandra]
Oh, that's a great back.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.413
I like that back.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.648
[Fanny] I like that back, yeah.

24:10.682 --> 24:11.715
In a weird way though,

24:11.750 --> 24:14.518
these look very similar
next to each other.

24:14.553 --> 24:15.719
- [Krissy] Well...
- [Candace] Well...

24:15.754 --> 24:18.889
[Krissy and Candace]
...they're the same designer.

24:18.924 --> 24:19.857
[laughter]

24:19.891 --> 24:21.692
- [Krissy] Yeah, same beading.
- [Fanny] Yeah.

24:21.726 --> 24:22.827
[Krissy]
So you see the tone of work.

24:22.861 --> 24:24.995
[Candace] In the design
and that neckline,

24:25.030 --> 24:27.331
how it kind of plunges down
in the center.

24:27.365 --> 24:28.899
For you, like, this is pretty,

24:28.934 --> 24:30.835
but for sure
the first one is still...

24:30.869 --> 24:31.902
- Yeah.
- ...number one.

24:31.937 --> 24:35.239
Okay. So this just confirmed
that even more, so...

24:35.273 --> 24:36.540
- okay.
- Right.

24:36.575 --> 24:37.608
Instantly you put it on,
you were like,

24:37.642 --> 24:39.410
- "Yo, this is it?"
- [Carly]<i> Instantly.</i>

24:39.444 --> 24:40.744
<i>I'm not even kidding. Instantly.</i>

24:40.779 --> 24:42.580
I was like, "Okay." Yeah.

24:42.614 --> 24:44.448
Do you realize like that...
Like how impressive that is?

24:44.483 --> 24:46.183
That's like your first dress
that you tried on,

24:46.218 --> 24:47.485
- that's crazy.
- Yeah.

24:47.519 --> 24:49.320
- [Krissy] Beautiful.
- [Candace] Uh-huh.

24:49.354 --> 24:50.387
[Carly] That's a great photo.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.323
Okay, practicing
for the big day.

24:52.357 --> 24:53.724
- [Carly] Yeah.
- [Kassandra] Yeah, yeah.

24:53.758 --> 24:57.328
So you girls did some shopping
for us, right?

24:57.362 --> 24:58.429
[woman] Yes, we did.

24:58.463 --> 24:59.730
So it's that one right there,
the big one right there.

24:59.764 --> 25:02.166
[Carly] Oh my gosh, mom,
that's way too much.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.234
[Fanny] Carly.

25:03.268 --> 25:04.535
Definitely Cinderella.

25:04.569 --> 25:06.670
And we also have a dress that

25:06.705 --> 25:08.706
the four of them picked out
for you as well.

25:08.740 --> 25:09.907
[Krissy] We'll come out
in your picks.

25:09.941 --> 25:10.841
[Candace] Yes.

25:10.876 --> 25:14.044
And then we'll see
where we go from there.

25:14.079 --> 25:15.479
[Carly] Wow, mom,
that's just so big.

25:15.514 --> 25:16.547
Carly.

25:16.581 --> 25:18.182
It's once in a lifetime.

25:18.216 --> 25:19.517
First of all,
this is my wedding too.

25:19.551 --> 25:20.684
I've never been married.

25:20.719 --> 25:23.354
I just envision you
being larger than life

25:23.388 --> 25:26.290
as my baby princess queen.

25:26.324 --> 25:27.491
[Carly laughs] Okay.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.692
Okay. Let's do it. Let's try it.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.361
- [Fanny] Okay, good.
- [laughs]

25:30.395 --> 25:32.496
[Fanny] You may like it.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.533
- [Eunice] You like it?
- I love, but...

25:35.567 --> 25:38.035
- ...mom...
- The price tag.

25:38.069 --> 25:39.169
Pew.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.237
[Eunice] Oh.

25:44.609 --> 25:44.708
[upbeat music playing]

25:52.751 --> 25:55.119
[woman] This is
your beautiful dress.

25:55.153 --> 25:56.453
Oh my gosh.

25:56.488 --> 25:59.256
It looks even better
than the first time.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.524
[Ronnie] Randy, we've got...

26:00.559 --> 26:02.393
we've got a wonderful bride.

26:02.427 --> 26:04.461
We're doing a fitting
for her right now.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.430
She doesn't know that you and I

26:06.464 --> 26:07.531
are gonna be speaking to her,

26:07.566 --> 26:10.334
so let me... let me walk up
and we'll go over there.

26:10.368 --> 26:11.435
- Wow.
- Oh my gosh.

26:11.469 --> 26:13.470
- Fit you like a glove.
- Oh my gosh.

26:13.504 --> 26:15.272
You look beautiful.

26:15.307 --> 26:16.640
Beautiful.

26:16.675 --> 26:19.977
I can't wait for Josh
to see me in this dress.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.315
[Samantha] Oh, my God.

26:25.383 --> 26:26.383
Stop it.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.484
[Ashley] What are you thinking?

26:27.519 --> 26:29.954
[Samantha] I love it.
Are you kidding?

26:31.289 --> 26:33.257
[Ronnie] Ashley.

26:33.291 --> 26:35.192
- Hi.
- [Ronnie] And Samantha?

26:35.226 --> 26:36.260
Hi.

26:36.294 --> 26:37.861
[Ronnie] So this young lady

26:37.896 --> 26:42.766
wrote me the most beautiful
letter in the world.

26:42.801 --> 26:45.536
Every bride who comes
into Kleinfeld is special.

26:45.570 --> 26:47.571
You're more special
than everybody right now.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.406
- [Ashley] I second that.
- You're saving lives.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.975
Don't do this to me.

26:51.009 --> 26:52.409
[Ronnie] And you...
And you risk your life.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.544
I don't know how to thank you.

26:53.578 --> 26:54.745
How do... How does...

26:54.779 --> 26:56.847
how does everybody
in New York thank you?

26:56.881 --> 27:01.285
There's somebody very special
who we would like you to meet.

27:01.319 --> 27:04.355
And his name is Randy Fenoli.

27:04.389 --> 27:06.490
Hello, beautiful Ashley.
How are you?

27:06.524 --> 27:09.393
I'm good. [laughs] Oh my God.

27:09.427 --> 27:10.728
Hi. Oh my God.

27:10.762 --> 27:12.529
Let me see the dress.
I wanna see the dress.

27:12.564 --> 27:14.231
<i>It looks amazing.</i>

27:14.265 --> 27:15.599
<i>Oh wow.</i>

27:15.634 --> 27:18.235
<i>Isn't that, um, Maison Signore?</i>

27:18.269 --> 27:19.570
[Ashley] It is.

27:19.604 --> 27:21.405
That is gorgeous on you.

27:21.439 --> 27:22.473
Wow.

27:22.507 --> 27:24.775
[Ashley] Thank you.
It's my dream dress.

27:24.809 --> 27:26.543
-I can't even...
-[Randy] <i>And this is your...</i>

27:26.578 --> 27:28.545
<i>this is your first fitting?</i>

27:28.580 --> 27:29.747
- Yes.
- [Randy]<i> Wow.</i>

27:29.781 --> 27:32.149
It looks really...
It looks like it fits almost.

27:32.183 --> 27:34.518
I mean, what do they
have to do? Do you know?

27:34.552 --> 27:36.787
I'm gonna pull it up
a little over here.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.923
[laughs] Is it... Is it coming
out a little bit too much?

27:39.958 --> 27:42.593
Uh, just little bit, but it's
okay, I'm not complaining.

27:42.627 --> 27:44.528
I'm just saying it could use
a little adjustment.

27:44.562 --> 27:46.363
<i>That's all.</i>

27:46.398 --> 27:48.309
She's gonna be
the most beautiful bride.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.533
Thank you so much. Thank you.

27:49.567 --> 27:51.669
[Ronnie] Listen, we're
grateful that you came here.

27:51.703 --> 27:54.638
Even little Lucy came
to say hello.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.473
- Hi.
- [Ronnie]<i> To say hello.</i>

27:56.508 --> 27:58.275
I've got Chewy. Look.

27:58.309 --> 27:59.510
Chewy says hello.

27:59.544 --> 28:01.178
- [laughs]
- [Mara] Hi, Randy.

28:01.212 --> 28:02.513
<i>Hi, Mara. How are you?</i>

28:02.547 --> 28:05.816
I'm wishing you and Josh
the most wonderful wedding

28:05.850 --> 28:08.652
<i>and the most beautiful future
together.</i>

28:08.687 --> 28:09.820
[Ronnie]
And Josh is a lucky guy.

28:09.854 --> 28:13.190
- So congratulations.
- [Ronnie]<i> We'll see you soon.</i>

28:13.224 --> 28:14.224
<i>Bye.</i>

28:14.259 --> 28:16.360
Bye.

28:16.394 --> 28:17.494
I'm excited.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.296
This is good.

28:19.330 --> 28:21.398
This is good stuff.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.367
Oh my gosh, it's so beautiful.

28:23.401 --> 28:25.002
[Samantha]<i> It's perfect.</i>

28:25.036 --> 28:27.571
<i>Ashley looks amazing
in this dress.</i>

28:27.605 --> 28:29.573
<i>I'm looking forward
to this wedding.</i>

28:29.607 --> 28:31.642
I can't wait to see Ashley
in the dress all fitted.

28:31.676 --> 28:34.511
See it on the beach,
see her and marry her fiance,

28:34.546 --> 28:36.213
like, I can't wait.

28:36.247 --> 28:37.681
Sam, thank you.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.384
- Of course.
- Again, and again, and again.

28:40.418 --> 28:42.386
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.321
You deserve it more than anyone.

28:44.355 --> 28:45.589
<i>Walking down the aisle,</i>

28:45.623 --> 28:48.092
I'm gonna feel so overwhelmed

28:48.126 --> 28:49.893
and so happy

28:49.928 --> 28:54.331
and really humbled
by this experience.

28:54.365 --> 28:58.569
<i>I get to take that really
good energy into wedding day</i>

28:58.603 --> 29:01.271
<i>and marry the man of my dreams</i>

29:01.306 --> 29:02.506
<i>in the dress of my dreams.</i>

29:02.540 --> 29:04.408
Like, you can't really
ask for more.

29:04.442 --> 29:07.044
I'm so ready to get married.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.215
[upbeat music playing]

29:13.485 --> 29:15.352
This is Mom's pick

29:15.386 --> 29:18.522
and it's so beautiful
and it's so heavy.

29:18.556 --> 29:19.656
But I get it.

29:19.691 --> 29:22.292
She wants to see her daughter
in a beautiful ball gown.

29:22.327 --> 29:24.027
So why not?

29:25.196 --> 29:26.663
Okay, Carly.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.409
- I'm here.
- [Carly] You're here?

29:28.433 --> 29:30.367
And I'm out of breath
because it's heavy,

29:30.401 --> 29:31.335
I'm not even kidding.

29:31.369 --> 29:32.369
Yeah. [laughs]

29:32.403 --> 29:34.638
[Krissy] Yeah,
it's an arm workout. Like...

29:34.672 --> 29:35.806
This is a princess dress.

29:35.840 --> 29:40.377
[Fanny] I wanna see Carly
in a Cinderella type of vibe.

29:40.411 --> 29:42.713
First wedding... Uh, as a mom.

29:42.747 --> 29:45.783
So she's requesting
your presence in the back.

29:45.817 --> 29:47.451
[Fanny] That means
she doesn't like it.

29:47.485 --> 29:48.519
[exhales]

29:48.553 --> 29:52.289
- Oh my gosh, Carly.
- Aww.

29:52.323 --> 29:53.791
How could you not like this one?

29:53.825 --> 29:55.859
- [Carly] This is a gown.
- [Eunice] It is.

29:55.894 --> 29:58.162
- [Fanny] It's a wedding gown.
- [Erica] Yeah.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.631
It's pretty. It's big.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.332
- Oh my gosh, Carly.
- [Carly] Yeah?

30:02.367 --> 30:04.034
This is my number one.

30:05.370 --> 30:06.703
[Carly] Even more
than the first one, Mom?

30:06.738 --> 30:10.340
Yes, because you are a princess.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.209
But the first one made you cry.

30:13.578 --> 30:14.611
Do you like it?

30:14.646 --> 30:17.581
- [Kassandra] I love it.
- Huh, Kass?

30:17.615 --> 30:19.516
What do you think, Kass?

30:19.551 --> 30:20.517
[Kassandra]
It's just really like wow.

30:20.552 --> 30:21.785
It's just wow, yeah.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.388
This is like
a beautiful dress, yeah.

30:24.422 --> 30:25.522
I just still think
that first one,

30:25.557 --> 30:26.757
I think that first one's it.

30:26.791 --> 30:28.625
[Kassandra]
<i>It is a beautiful dress.</i>

30:28.660 --> 30:31.361
Is it as stunning
as the first one?

30:31.396 --> 30:32.629
No, no, no, I don't think so.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.631
- Yeah, not quite.
- Yeah.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.567
[Krissy] Oh, I'll just
walk you in the room.

30:36.601 --> 30:38.268
- [Carly] Oh, thank you.
- [Krissy] Come on, Carly.

30:38.303 --> 30:39.336
[laughs]

30:41.539 --> 30:43.540
[Carly] And the dress
is still entering.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.610
I love you, Mom. [laughs]

30:46.644 --> 30:48.512
[Candace]
The family, I ran into them

30:48.546 --> 30:49.680
and they were choosing dresses.

30:49.714 --> 30:53.016
As you can see, they went
completely different.

30:53.051 --> 30:54.952
This one is the same designer
as Carly's first one.

30:54.986 --> 30:57.387
[Kassandra] It's completely
different than what we've tried.

30:57.422 --> 30:58.622
So that's why it's kind of cool.

30:58.656 --> 31:00.891
[Candace]
Now, this one is probably like

31:00.925 --> 31:03.327
the most expensive dress
I brought in, it's $4,500.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.662
- How much was that one?
- $4,500.

31:05.697 --> 31:09.233
This one is $2,800, the Martina.

31:09.267 --> 31:10.567
I'm a little worried because

31:10.602 --> 31:13.370
<i>their budget combined is $8,000.</i>

31:13.404 --> 31:15.372
This dress is $4,500

31:15.406 --> 31:19.476
and if Carly's dress
is over $3,500,

31:19.510 --> 31:21.612
that puts us over
our $8,000 budget.

31:21.646 --> 31:24.014
I'm just gonna go ahead
and clip it for you.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.215
But it was the Mom's pick,

31:25.250 --> 31:28.385
so I really feel like I have
to show Kassandra this dress.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.554
I just hope I don't regret it.

31:30.588 --> 31:33.690
I'm actually, um, I'm impressed.

31:33.725 --> 31:34.625
<i>I would have never
picked it out.</i>

31:34.659 --> 31:36.593
That's not even like a design

31:36.628 --> 31:39.229
I would have thought
looked good on me.

31:39.264 --> 31:42.266
I am wowed by my reflection.

31:42.300 --> 31:45.736
I just... I can't even believe
how stunning this dress is.

31:45.770 --> 31:48.739
This is honestly
a shocker for me.

31:48.773 --> 31:52.876
I didn't expect to like this
this much and I'm blown away.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.445
[Candace] So does this one
kind of bumps this down a little bit?

31:55.480 --> 31:56.613
[Kassandra]
It competes with this one.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.081
It competes with it.
I don't know yet.

31:58.116 --> 31:59.516
I'm kind of waiting
to see reactions.

31:59.550 --> 32:00.717
- [Candace] Okay.
- Give me a second.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.319
- Hang on real tight, okay?
- Okay.

32:02.353 --> 32:03.553
[Kassandra] I'm hanging on.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.088
[knocks on the door]

32:05.123 --> 32:06.223
Krissy?

32:06.257 --> 32:07.457
- Come on in.
- Hello.

32:07.492 --> 32:08.725
[Candace] Oh, we're back
in the first one.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.327
[Carly]
Back in the first dress, yeah.

32:10.361 --> 32:11.461
[Krissy] This is her gown.

32:11.496 --> 32:14.598
- She's in love with it.
- [Candace] In love. Obsessed.

32:14.632 --> 32:15.666
Yeah. I'm in love.

32:15.700 --> 32:18.769
[Candace] So we have a little
bit of a situation.

32:18.803 --> 32:21.104
- [Krissy] Oh.
- How much is this dress?

32:21.139 --> 32:23.173
$5,100.

32:23.207 --> 32:24.508
$5,100?

32:24.542 --> 32:26.643
- Okay. Because...
- How much is...

32:26.678 --> 32:28.445
There's a dress that we...

32:28.479 --> 32:31.415
I don't wanna use
the I word fully.

32:31.449 --> 32:35.185
We real... We're in deep like.

32:35.219 --> 32:36.653
- [Carly] Okay.
- Is what I'm gonna say.

32:36.688 --> 32:39.222
- [Carly] Mmm-hmm.
- And it's also a Tony Ward.

32:39.257 --> 32:40.424
[Carly] Oh, really?

32:40.458 --> 32:42.893
And it's $4,500.

32:42.927 --> 32:47.297
- [Carly] Oh.
- So that puts us over.

32:47.332 --> 32:50.934
$1,600 over budget.

32:50.969 --> 32:51.668
Wow.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.570
- [Carly] Oh, my goodness.
- I know.

32:53.604 --> 32:55.672
I know that the ladies
are paying for the dresses

32:55.707 --> 32:57.307
<i>out of their own pockets.</i>

32:57.342 --> 32:59.810
<i>So if Kassandra loves the dress,</i>

32:59.844 --> 33:02.579
<i>then I don't know
what we're gonna do.</i>

33:02.613 --> 33:04.281
- Here's the thing.
- [Kassandra] Mmm-hmm.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.216
I know that we love that dress.

33:06.250 --> 33:10.287
But Carly's dress is $5,100.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.689
[Kassandra] If all fails...

33:12.724 --> 33:14.391
[Candace] What are you gonna do?

33:14.425 --> 33:17.060
[dramatic music playing]

33:25.436 --> 33:27.771
-[Candace] So here's the thing.
-Mmm-hmm.

33:27.805 --> 33:30.340
I know that we love that dress.

33:30.375 --> 33:33.643
But Carly's dress is $5,100.

33:33.678 --> 33:37.514
[Kassandra]<i> Our budget is</i>
<i>$8,000 for both of us.</i>

33:37.548 --> 33:38.582
[Carly]<i> Yeah.</i>

33:38.616 --> 33:41.718
So one dress is under budget,
it's within budget.

33:41.753 --> 33:44.454
And then this perfect dress
is over budget,

33:44.489 --> 33:48.558
and now I have to go, okay,
do I go over budget?

33:48.593 --> 33:51.228
Or do I stay within budget

33:51.262 --> 33:53.397
and let her have...

33:53.431 --> 33:54.331
most of the budget?

33:54.365 --> 33:57.667
If all fails...

33:57.702 --> 33:58.602
What are you gonna do?

33:58.636 --> 34:00.604
I'd probably just
go within budget.

34:00.638 --> 34:02.406
[Candace] You wanna stay in
budget if all fails?

34:02.440 --> 34:03.774
[Kassandra] If all fails, yeah.

34:03.808 --> 34:05.609
That's okay. But I do want
them to see this.

34:05.643 --> 34:07.310
But do you love both of them?

34:07.345 --> 34:09.546
I do. Like,
at the end of the day

34:09.580 --> 34:11.348
I'm going to say I do
regardless.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.584
- Okay.
- So I don't mind saying I do

34:14.619 --> 34:16.286
in the dress that
I lose my top pick prior...

34:16.320 --> 34:17.387
That was still a wow factor.

34:17.422 --> 34:18.355
Yeah, it was still a wow factor.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.756
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know what I mean?

34:19.791 --> 34:22.859
I was quite nervous to even
show her the dress in the first place,

34:22.894 --> 34:24.928
let alone bring her out
for everyone to see it.

34:24.962 --> 34:28.665
Because it's hard when you
fall in love with something

34:28.699 --> 34:30.801
and then you can't have it.

34:30.835 --> 34:31.935
It's... That's the first rule
in bridal,

34:31.969 --> 34:35.338
you never show a bride a dress
that's over her budget.

34:35.373 --> 34:39.176
[indistinct chatter]

34:39.210 --> 34:41.111
Oh!

34:41.145 --> 34:43.146
This one.

34:44.415 --> 34:45.382
Absolutely.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.050
Beautiful.

34:47.618 --> 34:49.219
This was the one.

34:49.253 --> 34:50.287
Yes.

34:51.722 --> 34:53.590
- Va-va-voom.
- [Candace] This is Tony Ward.

34:53.624 --> 34:55.258
[woman] This is the one
that I said.

34:55.293 --> 34:58.228
- This is...
- [woman] Wow.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.563
[Eunice] Turn around.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.364
- It's just gorgeous.
- Wow.

35:01.399 --> 35:03.700
[Candace] And then
what's so cool about it.

35:03.734 --> 35:06.536
It has this extra piece
in the back.

35:06.571 --> 35:09.473
Look at that back. Ooh.

35:09.507 --> 35:11.341
Kassandra, this has to be it.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.509
This has to be it.

35:12.543 --> 35:13.777
- Oh, my God.
- [woman] Yeah.

35:13.811 --> 35:16.313
- This is our number one.
- [woman] Uh-oh.

35:16.347 --> 35:18.348
- You like it?
- I love.

35:18.382 --> 35:20.283
- Oh. Okay.
- [Kassandra] I love.

35:20.318 --> 35:21.451
Say thank you, mama.

35:21.486 --> 35:24.354
Thank you, mommy. But mom...

35:24.388 --> 35:26.156
- There's a but?
- ...there's a but.

35:26.190 --> 35:27.290
[Eunice] I know.

35:27.358 --> 35:29.326
The price tag.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.393
- The price tag?
- [Candace] Yes.

35:30.428 --> 35:32.129
Pew.

35:32.163 --> 35:33.497
[woman] Oh, yes.

35:33.531 --> 35:37.567
[Candace]
So this dress is $4,500,

35:37.602 --> 35:40.437
Carly's dress is $5,100.

35:40.471 --> 35:41.571
Without tax?

35:41.606 --> 35:44.341
Without tax, 8.8%.

35:44.375 --> 35:47.544
[laughter]

35:47.578 --> 35:51.615
Do we donate to the dresses
that are killers?

35:51.649 --> 35:53.250
[Candace] It's up to you.

35:53.284 --> 35:55.285
- Yeah.
- This has to be it.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.487
- Okay.
- This has to be it.

35:57.522 --> 36:00.790
Kassandra was very young
when she first married

36:00.825 --> 36:04.728
and seeing her growth
as an individual.

36:04.762 --> 36:06.530
This time,
she's actually soaking it in

36:06.564 --> 36:09.833
and to see how
she felt for the dress.

36:09.867 --> 36:14.271
And it just...
it just made it all complete.

36:18.442 --> 36:21.411
- [In Spanish]
- [woman] You look beautiful.

36:21.445 --> 36:23.346
[Eunice] You're stunning.

36:23.381 --> 36:25.549
You are...

36:25.583 --> 36:29.586
an amazing human being
and I am so proud of you

36:30.621 --> 36:34.424
and the journey that
you are taking in your life.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.092
It's precious.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.294
Hi.

36:37.328 --> 36:40.530
You look amazing.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.432
- Wow.
- [woman] Oh, my God.

36:42.466 --> 36:45.402
Girl, I'm a mess.

36:45.436 --> 36:46.903
[laughter]

36:46.938 --> 36:50.440
Looking at you in that dress
like took my breath away.

36:50.474 --> 36:53.577
<i>This dress is insane.</i>

36:53.611 --> 36:54.778
<i>You look so stunning in it</i>

36:54.812 --> 36:57.847
and I knew that
that was the one.

36:57.882 --> 36:58.882
You're so expensive.

36:58.916 --> 37:01.918
$5,100. I'm sorry.
I couldn't... It's Tony. Okay?

37:01.953 --> 37:04.221
Were you not thinking about me?

37:04.255 --> 37:05.222
You weren't?

37:05.256 --> 37:06.590
What is a budget?

37:06.624 --> 37:07.691
<i>What is a budget?</i>

37:07.725 --> 37:09.559
- At this point...
- What is a budget?

37:09.594 --> 37:13.430
You look amazing and
I can't wait to marry you.

37:13.464 --> 37:16.366
I can't wait to say I do. Stop.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.834
- Tell me about this.
- [woman] Oh, Dorothy.

37:17.868 --> 37:20.470
I've been stuck in my office
all day, I come walking out.

37:20.504 --> 37:21.638
What's going on?

37:21.672 --> 37:23.373
Look at these beautiful brides.

37:23.407 --> 37:24.407
- Wow.
- Beautiful brides.

37:24.442 --> 37:25.875
Wow. Wow. Wow.

37:25.910 --> 37:32.048
And then Paoulo is not here,
but he is the groom.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.683
Okay.

37:33.718 --> 37:36.720
You know, we're Kleinfeld and
Kleinfeld, we dress brides.

37:36.754 --> 37:39.656
<i>Who are we to say who we
dress, who we don't dress.</i>

37:39.690 --> 37:42.959
I'm just so thrilled
that two people found love,

37:42.994 --> 37:44.394
maybe three people found love.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.296
And it's a wonderful thing.

37:46.330 --> 37:47.430
It's a wonderful thing.

37:47.465 --> 37:53.403
So Kassandra and Carly,

37:53.437 --> 37:57.507
are you saying yes to the dress?

37:57.541 --> 37:59.442
- Yes.
- Yes.

37:59.477 --> 38:02.379
[cheers and applause]

38:02.413 --> 38:04.147
- Pao is gonna be in awe.
- [Kassandra] Mmm-hmm.

38:04.181 --> 38:08.652
[Carly]<i> He is... I know that</i>
<i>he is going to love our picks</i>

38:08.686 --> 38:12.122
and I cannot wait
until the wedding,

38:12.156 --> 38:13.590
- until he... You know.
- He's gonna be blown away.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.425
Everyone's in?

38:15.459 --> 38:17.394
Yes.

38:17.428 --> 38:20.163
[laughter]

38:20.197 --> 38:21.665
- [Paoulo]<i> How did it go?</i>
- We have dresses.

38:21.699 --> 38:23.333
You see I was trying
to get it out of you guys.

38:23.367 --> 38:24.367
You have to wait
until the wedding.

38:24.402 --> 38:26.336
There's a...
There's a wedding happening.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.438
And we have dresses
for that wedding.

38:28.472 --> 38:29.572
- Whoa.
- That's all I'm gonna say.

38:29.607 --> 38:31.341
- That's all I need to know.
- That's all you need.

38:31.375 --> 38:33.343
I'm a happy man.
I'm a happy man.

38:33.377 --> 38:34.477
I love you guys.

38:34.512 --> 38:35.545
- I love you, too.
- I love you.

38:35.579 --> 38:37.447
- Aww, we did it.
- Yay.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.249
Yay.

38:39.283 --> 38:43.286
[dramatic music playing]

38:44.789 --> 38:45.922
[Ashley]<i> A year ago today,</i>

38:45.956 --> 38:47.891
<i>I didn't know if I would
actually be getting married,</i>

38:47.925 --> 38:49.826
<i>I didn't know if I was gonna
have to put off the wedding.</i>

38:49.860 --> 38:51.828
But I was extremely lucky,
we picked our date

38:51.862 --> 38:54.731
like two weeks before
the pandemic really hit,

38:54.765 --> 38:56.599
<i>and then we got
to keep our date,</i>

38:56.634 --> 38:57.834
<i>and everything has
kind of worked out.</i>

38:57.868 --> 39:01.338
<i>We get everybody customized
masks, sanitizer.</i>

39:01.372 --> 39:04.207
<i>Over 70% of our wedding
is vaccinated,</i>

39:04.241 --> 39:05.508
and then everybody else

39:05.543 --> 39:07.544
got a rapid negative test
the day of.

39:07.578 --> 39:10.613
<i>I keep looking at my dress.
It's so beautiful.</i>

39:10.648 --> 39:12.449
<i>It's hanging up.
It's torturing me</i>

39:12.483 --> 39:15.018
<i>because I just wanna
put it on already.</i>

39:16.620 --> 39:19.422
Ashley, the world has changed
a lot since we first met.

39:19.457 --> 39:20.623
I remember meeting you downtown,

39:20.658 --> 39:22.525
but having no idea
what to expect.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.594
This little shawty medical
student with green eyes

39:24.628 --> 39:25.762
that light up a room.

39:25.796 --> 39:27.964
The world changed for me
that day.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.603
Watching you face
every adversity

39:33.637 --> 39:34.738
before you this past year,

39:34.772 --> 39:36.506
I remember you coming home
last spring,

39:36.540 --> 39:37.774
eyes swollen with tears,

39:37.808 --> 39:39.709
face imprinted from the mask.

39:39.744 --> 39:41.911
I've never respected
someone so much.

39:42.813 --> 39:44.514
I just can't imagine
anyone loving anyone

39:44.548 --> 39:46.282
as much as I love you

39:46.317 --> 39:47.450
until I wake up the next day

39:47.485 --> 39:48.918
because I love you even more.

39:48.953 --> 39:50.887
I'm the luckiest man in
the world to be marrying you.

39:50.921 --> 39:54.557
I look forward to our
beautiful life together forever.

39:54.592 --> 39:57.127
- Love, Josh.
- [Jill] I love that man.

39:57.161 --> 39:58.361
I love him.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.796
[laughter]

39:59.830 --> 40:02.532
She's beautiful,
the dress is beautiful.

40:02.566 --> 40:03.767
Everything is going her way.

40:03.801 --> 40:06.536
You couldn't ask
for a better daughter.

40:06.570 --> 40:09.272
[producer speaking]

40:09.306 --> 40:10.473
Babies.

40:10.508 --> 40:12.542
[cheering]

40:12.576 --> 40:13.610
[Josh]<i> I'm anxious.</i>

40:13.644 --> 40:16.646
I'm marrying the woman
of my dreams.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.982
<i>I'm looking forward
to have a good time,</i>

40:19.016 --> 40:20.517
<i>looking forward to see Ashley
in her dress.</i>

40:20.551 --> 40:22.685
I'm looking forward
to see her smile.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.622
[Jill] I didn't think this day
was ever gonna happen.

40:25.656 --> 40:28.491
I'm like, where is it going?

40:28.526 --> 40:30.560
Ashley's my heart.
I'm lucky to be with her.

40:30.594 --> 40:31.795
<i>I don't know
what she sees in me.</i>

40:31.829 --> 40:33.696
I mean, there's unlimited
things to see about her,

40:33.731 --> 40:35.598
but there's... I don't know
what she's doing with me,

40:35.633 --> 40:37.801
but that's another story.

40:37.835 --> 40:40.703

[Ashley]<i> Walking toward Josh,</i>
<i>I'm feeling overwhelmed.</i>

40:52.283 --> 40:53.583
<i>I was overcome with emotions.</i>

40:53.617 --> 40:55.852
<i>It just solidified</i>

40:55.886 --> 40:57.353
<i>that I'm marrying
the perfect person.</i>

40:59.990 --> 41:03.593
Today signifies
the creation of a new home

41:03.627 --> 41:04.994
and a new family for you both.

41:05.029 --> 41:08.798
May you be fulfilled by each
other's love and friendship

41:08.833 --> 41:11.534
and the life together
you will create.

41:11.569 --> 41:15.038
Do you, Josh,
take this woman, Ashley?

41:15.072 --> 41:16.206
I do.

41:16.240 --> 41:19.409
And do you, Ashley,
take this man, Josh?

41:19.443 --> 41:21.211

- Oh.

41:30.387 --> 41:33.223

41:34.391 --> 41:35.558
[Ashley]
<i>There were a lot of times</i>

41:35.593 --> 41:37.494
<i>where we didn't think that
this was gonna be possible</i>

41:37.528 --> 41:39.329
<i>because of everything
going on in the world.</i>

41:39.363 --> 41:40.530
<i>But the fact that
it was perfect.</i>

41:40.564 --> 41:41.631

41:41.665 --> 41:44.200

41:52.943 --> 41:54.377
<i>It seems like
you're on an island.</i>

41:54.411 --> 41:56.079
- It's in...
- It's Long Island.
