02:24.720 --> 02:28.560
THE DAY BEFORE

02:29.600 --> 02:32.360
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

03:16.280 --> 03:19.800
Tullio Adami, 53,
notorious local Roman boss,

03:19.880 --> 03:23.480
was brutally murdered last night in Ostia

03:23.560 --> 03:26.280
from multiple gunshot wounds.

03:26.360 --> 03:29.720
Adami was known to police, who've
had him under surveillance for years...

03:29.800 --> 03:31.480
Now the shit's gonna hit the fan.

03:32.240 --> 03:35.800
A murdered boss means
that there's going to be a turf war.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.440
Now I'll have to do overtime,

03:38.520 --> 03:39.800
paid in six months...

03:45.120 --> 03:46.520
Everything all right?

03:47.040 --> 03:49.120
Yeah, everything's good.
I didn't sleep much.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.800
What's this mud all over the house?

03:51.520 --> 03:53.800
Nothing.
I went to a party outdoors last night.

03:53.880 --> 03:55.560
What a nice life you have.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.440
I'm going to work.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.320
Gabriele, study, don't waste time.

04:00.960 --> 04:02.040
Yeah.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.520
-See ya, Dad.
-Bye.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.200
All leads are being investigated,

04:10.280 --> 04:14.120
including payback
from the Adamis' criminal rivals.

04:14.200 --> 04:18.800
The police were called by neighbors,
alerted by the sound of gunshots.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.839
Witnesses say they heard gunshots...

04:21.920 --> 04:25.280
-Was it you?
-If only, I wish.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.560
-Then who was it?
-That's what I'd like to know.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.000
Anyway,
everyone's convinced it was us.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.680
Just wait, they'll come shoot us
outside our front door.

04:33.760 --> 04:37.040
...he is survived by his two children,
Livia, 30, and Aureliano, 25.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.640
-Now who will take the old man's place?
-His son.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.960
He can't wait to see more blood flow.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.720
Maybe we should put off the wedding.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.560
Maybe you should shut up,
the wedding's going ahead.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.640
Go get dressed, go on.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.880
Will you tell me what's wrong?

06:08.800 --> 06:10.080
Nothing's wrong.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.360
Listen, I don't know what's wrong,
but something is.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.520
You just can't quit, can you?

06:20.400 --> 06:21.920
That doesn't help, fuck.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.800
Fuck you.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.760
Excuse me. Have you got a light?

06:35.440 --> 06:36.400
Thanks.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.720
Nice shop, pretty wife, good for you.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.840
-I don't understand what you sell.
-Perfume on tap.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.880
-Regular ones are no good anymore?
-It's something new.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.240
A good husband...

07:00.320 --> 07:02.120
and a good father of two children.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.120
So, how much did Taccon cost us?

07:07.120 --> 07:09.480
Taccon says he's got no price.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.360
We've all got a price, you know that.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.520
I don't know anything anymore.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.560
You know what you've got to do.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.120
But I wasn't aware of certain details.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.520
-What do you mean?
-Nothing.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.000
I knew I should have dropped by.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.760
I don't care how,
but Taccon's got to be on our side.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.520
-Gianni Taccon.
-Sara Monaschi.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.560
Take a seat.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.040
If I'm here, it's out of respect
for the Countess.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.280
I'll listen, but I won't do anything
that violates my mandate.

08:03.360 --> 08:06.720
Yes, of course,
that's why I wanted to talk to you.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.200
-You know I work in the Vatican.
-Yes.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.840
My husband is a developer

08:14.680 --> 08:17.280
and he's interested
in the new zoning plan.

08:17.360 --> 08:18.680
I know that, too.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.040
And do you also know
that we've been pressured

08:22.120 --> 08:25.080
to sell the land in Ostia
to a group of entrepreneurs?

08:25.400 --> 08:27.400
And who would these entrepreneurs be?

08:28.920 --> 08:31.360
I'll tell you who's behind them.

08:32.760 --> 08:33.919
I'm listening.

08:35.720 --> 08:36.880
Samurai.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.440
-Do you know who he is?
-Yes.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.320
Then you also know
who corrupted Finucci.

08:43.400 --> 08:47.520
-The trial will decide this.
-But meanwhile, you can change things.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.840
And I'll do my best,
both for your husband

08:50.920 --> 08:53.360
and for whoever else is interested
in that land.

08:53.440 --> 08:57.080
But my husband is not a criminal,
and there is no one behind him.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.200
Goodbye.

08:59.600 --> 09:00.800
Goodbye.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.400
Theodosiou didn't show up,
and we weren't able to vote.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.040
He didn't show up? Where is he?

09:19.360 --> 09:21.360
He sent word he's unwell,

09:21.440 --> 09:24.520
and some members of the Commission
would like to substitute him.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.840
That would be a disaster

09:26.920 --> 09:30.840
now that you've forced him
and Sara Monaschi to sell you the land.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.120
Time's running out,

09:33.200 --> 09:37.160
and without the monsignor, I don't know
if we'll have the necessary votes.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.480
You know
how complex the Vatican is, don't you?

09:58.720 --> 10:00.680
Sara Monaschi is behind this.

10:06.760 --> 10:10.640
It seems the Countess
is backing her up.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.760
If that were true,
they'd make a dangerous couple.

10:15.760 --> 10:18.160
I'm the dangerous one, Your Eminence.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.640
It's best that no one forgets that.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.040
Are you ready?

10:41.040 --> 10:42.360
Ready enough.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.560
Tonight you're changing beds

10:45.000 --> 10:46.840
and changing a lot of other things.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.720
-It's all the same.
-What are you talking about?

10:51.800 --> 10:53.560
I still use half a bed.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.920
Yes, but you're not alone anymore,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.680
you're sleeping with a woman, your wife.

11:03.520 --> 11:04.480
My wife...

11:05.200 --> 11:07.320
And you gotta behave like a husband.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.040
-You know that, right?
-What do you mean?

11:12.560 --> 11:13.880
You know.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.080
[in Sinti]
[If your father had been here,]

11:29.480 --> 11:31.160
[he would have given it to you.]

11:32.400 --> 11:33.880
[It was his.]

11:33.960 --> 11:35.360
[Now it's yours.]

11:36.320 --> 11:37.920
[Today, you become a man...]

11:39.880 --> 11:41.520
[and you need to behave like a man.]

11:54.600 --> 11:56.360
[It's yours. You must carry it always.]

12:41.400 --> 12:44.520
Aureliano took part of the money
that was stashed in the dunes.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.000
Do you know what that means?

12:46.840 --> 12:48.120
Shut up.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.960
It means he wants revenge,

12:52.040 --> 12:54.800
because he thinks
he's the head of this family.

12:55.480 --> 12:57.840
-And you gotta...
-I told you to shut up.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.920
Now that we've grieved,
let's dry our tears and open our eyes.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.320
We gotta stay on top
of those gypsy scum,

13:20.160 --> 13:23.440
I want to know how many there are,
where they are, what they're doing.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.960
As soon as they lower their guard,
we'll kill them,

13:26.880 --> 13:27.920
one by one.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.240
Aureliano.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.400
Condolences, Aureliano.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.160
Thanks.

13:50.280 --> 13:52.520
I knew your father since I was a kid.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.840
Me too, I think.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.040
What happens now?

14:01.840 --> 14:04.040
I don't know.
I'll think about it, all right?

14:06.160 --> 14:08.160
Don't fuck up, Aureliano.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.280
No, Samurai, the others fucked up,
now I've got to fix things.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.520
And you stay out of my way.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.840
Tullio always wanted you as the boss.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.280
Come in, sit down.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.000
How come Samurai didn't hug me?

16:03.520 --> 16:04.800
Cut it out, Aureliano.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.000
Why did you take Dad's money?

16:11.040 --> 16:14.240
-Because we're going to get revenge.
-And I had to find out on my own?

16:14.320 --> 16:17.040
How did I find out about Samurai's deal
with you and Dad?

16:17.120 --> 16:19.720
That's another story.
It's a much bigger deal...

16:19.800 --> 16:21.440
All right, enough, it's done.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.520
Things are gonna change.
I've got a war to wage.

16:24.600 --> 16:26.240
What war are you talking about?

16:29.280 --> 16:32.600
Didn't they teach you at school
to raise your hand if you wanna talk?

16:33.160 --> 16:34.800
-I didn't see yours.
-Please.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.720
Wait, let him speak.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.920
If I may, I've been handling
this family's accounts for seven years,

16:42.000 --> 16:44.320
seven years, day and night
at your father's side...

16:44.400 --> 16:45.520
Good.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.760
Now fuck off

16:48.080 --> 16:51.240
and don't come back,
'cause wars aren't waged with abacuses.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.520
What point are they at the Commission?

17:04.359 --> 17:06.760
The monsignor has taken a few days off.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.160
That's understandable,
considering what he went through.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.760
Yes, but time's nearly up,
he can rest later,

17:14.200 --> 17:16.040
now he needs to sign the papers.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.760
I'll try to call him,

17:18.839 --> 17:21.119
but unfortunately,
I don't know where he is.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.720
Well, I think you do.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.320
I'm afraid you're following bad advice.

17:33.640 --> 17:34.720
What does that mean?

17:34.800 --> 17:37.520
Time runs out for everyone,
even for you.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.200
You'd better find him.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.600
-How long have you worked for Taccon?
-Twelve years.

18:54.680 --> 18:55.880
Why do you want to know?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.720
Well, it's just that he seems
rather reserved...

18:58.800 --> 19:03.080
Go ahead and say it:
stiff, gruff, cold, introverted.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.360
-Because it's true.
-I noticed.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.440
I want to find a way
to establish a rapport,

19:08.520 --> 19:10.400
seeing as we have to work together.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.320
Can you give me any advice?

19:16.080 --> 19:17.640
Do you like museums?

19:18.960 --> 19:20.000
Yes.

20:54.680 --> 20:55.920
Where is it...?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.920
Still here?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.400
I'm not leaving you on your own, Livia.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.560
You're here just to save your job.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.360
I'm here to save you and your future.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.520
You can't leave the family
in the hands of that maniac.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.760
You and my brother are the same,
always thinking of the fucking future.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.800
We still haven't buried Dad.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.880
It's because of your dad that you've got
to do something, Tullio only trusted you.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.840
Don't you even mention my father.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.880
And now get out,

21:36.280 --> 21:37.360
leave me alone.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.600
The tie's under the black suit.

22:02.760 --> 22:03.920
Everything okay?

22:07.320 --> 22:08.520
The gun?

22:10.520 --> 22:11.800
At the bottom of the sea.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.040
Don't tell me I found a talent in you
you didn't know you had.

22:20.280 --> 22:23.040
I paid the debt, are we all good?

22:23.800 --> 22:24.880
All good.

22:26.200 --> 22:29.400
-Okay, so can I go now?
-No.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.560
You killed a boss on my orders.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.520
Do you know why you're still alive?

22:36.760 --> 22:38.120
Because I still need you.

22:39.880 --> 22:43.200
Starting today, you're my eyes and ears
in the Adami family.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.680
You've got to tell me everything,
especially what Aureliano is up to.

22:47.840 --> 22:48.880
Is that clear?

22:52.280 --> 22:53.360
Now you can go.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.160
Kiss!

23:45.520 --> 23:48.240
Kiss!

23:58.640 --> 24:00.240
Thanks for coming.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.760
I'm sorry.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.600
Who was it, do you know?

24:08.960 --> 24:10.760
The gypsies, who else?

24:15.320 --> 24:18.040
What now? What are you going to do?

24:18.440 --> 24:20.200
I want to kill them all.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.840
And you?

24:28.920 --> 24:30.120
How are you?

24:31.960 --> 24:33.840
It's like when you hate someone...

24:39.440 --> 24:41.360
Suddenly, they're not there,

24:43.880 --> 24:45.720
and you realize you miss them,

24:48.880 --> 24:51.040
because you can't even hate them anymore.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.560
Anyway, I'm here for you.

25:19.440 --> 25:20.600
Now I'm in charge.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.200
And everyone's gotta know.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.240
How did it go?

25:47.360 --> 25:48.920
How did it go with Samurai?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.280
He says he's in a hurry.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.040
He suspects,
and he even threatened me.

25:54.360 --> 25:57.120
As soon as Taccon discovers
who's behind his consortium,

25:57.200 --> 25:59.280
you'll see how Samurai
changes his tune

25:59.360 --> 26:00.720
and then he'll negotiate.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.200
Sara, you're distracted, what's going on?

26:05.880 --> 26:07.560
Is it because of Samurai
or something else?

26:08.200 --> 26:10.080
No, it's just that I'm worried.

26:13.760 --> 26:16.760
Don't tell me I'm making a mistake
by betting everything on you.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.160
Good morning, Countess.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.240
The usual white tea
with a hint of ginger.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.680
The same for me, thank you.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.280
Why do you want to get at Samurai?

26:31.440 --> 26:34.080
Because he ruined me
and my husband.

26:35.640 --> 26:36.520
How?

26:39.320 --> 26:42.760
-Remember Samurai's famous heist?
-Yes.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.360
The real objective wasn't the jewels,
but certain documents.

26:48.160 --> 26:50.760
With jewels, you can buy half Rome,
but with secrets,

26:50.840 --> 26:55.800
you can get it all and he took it.
He took my husband's company, too.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.280
And in the end,
my husband killed himself.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.840
Keep your eyes open.
We still haven't out-smarted Samurai.

27:12.680 --> 27:15.680
You're right, first Aureliano

27:16.000 --> 27:17.880
and then the scumbag gypsies.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.880
-One war at a time.
-How do you want to do this?

27:22.760 --> 27:25.560
Aureliano took some money
from the dunes,

27:25.640 --> 27:28.160
but he doesn't know fuck all
about the real business.

27:28.240 --> 27:30.240
Bring me all the accounts,

27:31.160 --> 27:33.400
I need to know how far I can push.

27:34.440 --> 27:35.800
What are you going to do?

27:37.400 --> 27:40.520
First, I want to speak
to the Ostia families that work for us,

27:41.440 --> 27:42.840
they gotta back me.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.880
What do you want in exchange
for your support?

28:16.040 --> 28:18.600
Support is an ugly word,
politicians use it.

28:19.240 --> 28:22.280
Let's say I help you climb
onto the throne that you deserve.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.480
-And in exchange?
-No more blood.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.680
No revenge against the gypsies,

28:29.240 --> 28:32.200
as well as what
your father promised me for Ostia.

28:35.120 --> 28:39.480
Dad's throne's not a high chair,
and I'm not a little kid anymore.

28:40.680 --> 28:41.720
Meaning?

28:42.120 --> 28:45.480
I'll sit on my father's throne alone,
I don't need your help.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.200
So what are you doing here?

28:50.400 --> 28:53.440
I've come to tell you
I won't avenge my father like you want,

28:55.040 --> 28:57.800
but in exchange,
I want 8% of the Ostia deal.

29:23.960 --> 29:26.120
Bring the newlyweds
onto the dance floor.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.800
Kids, go dance.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.400
Maestro!

29:40.760 --> 29:42.680
A slow number, please.

29:48.760 --> 29:52.160
Alberto, it's time
to ask your mother-in-law to dance.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.600
My brother is a lucky man.

30:28.040 --> 30:29.920
Long live the bride and groom!

30:33.680 --> 30:35.840
Congratulations!

31:37.840 --> 31:39.720
What's with all these people?

32:20.560 --> 32:23.040
Now you're showing your true colors, sis.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.680
You disgust me.

32:58.680 --> 33:00.280
-Good evening.
-Evening.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.680
You want to speak with me?

33:04.960 --> 33:08.360
I just wanted to know when we can
get together to coordinate the work.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.160
It's a bit early,
I still have to read all the paperwork.

33:11.240 --> 33:12.760
If you'll excuse me.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.840
What happened to that project of yours
on the museums of Rome?

33:17.720 --> 33:19.440
They chose someone else's.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.080
-But what do you know about it?
-I remember it well.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.720
It was a great project,

33:25.920 --> 33:27.280
do you ever think about it?

33:30.280 --> 33:34.160
Remember when City Hall put a she-wolf

33:34.560 --> 33:37.560
in a cage near here?

33:37.640 --> 33:40.600
It was a mascot,
Rome was founded by wolves.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.840
But they kept it in a cage,
just like Finucci.

33:46.520 --> 33:49.880
I'm checking the companies interested
in Ostia. There's something strange.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.080
But you said you haven't read
the paperwork yet...

33:53.520 --> 33:55.280
I can't trust anyone.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.320
But we're not wolves.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.160
No, I'd say we're not.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.520
What would you do if today they offered

34:09.600 --> 34:12.000
to go ahead with your project
on the museums of Rome?

34:12.880 --> 34:16.040
I wouldn't believe it and anyway,
they won't do that.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.199
Excuse me, but I've got to go.

34:19.840 --> 34:21.239
-Good night.
-Night.

34:52.440 --> 34:54.520
Now can you tell me why you called?

34:57.120 --> 34:58.680
Why were you with Samurai?

34:59.960 --> 35:01.640
My debt was with him.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.000
It's all taken care of now.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.840
-That's all?
-That's all.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.200
-What were you doing at the stables?
-Nothing important.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.800
Nothing important, with Samurai?

35:25.520 --> 35:27.160
Sara, what are we doing here?

35:27.760 --> 35:29.480
I was worried about you.

35:31.360 --> 35:34.320
When I saw you there, I was afraid.

35:37.080 --> 35:39.120
Afraid? Of what?

35:41.600 --> 35:42.720
I don't know.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.960
Tell me what we're doing here.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.360
-Where are you going?
-Home to bed, where else?

36:27.320 --> 36:28.240
Come here.

36:31.760 --> 36:32.920
What is it?

36:37.400 --> 36:38.920
I wanted to thank you.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.520
Without you, I couldn't have done it.

36:44.880 --> 36:46.600
You did it all on your own.

36:49.640 --> 36:52.000
I only wanted to save my job, huh?

37:32.800 --> 37:34.280
She's my life, Spadino.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.440
Now you're part of the family.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.720
Now you have to be a man,
do yourself proud.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.120
I'm gonna kill everyone!

38:17.200 --> 38:19.160
What happened?

38:20.040 --> 38:23.440
They fucked me...
Samurai, my father, my sister, everyone!

38:24.360 --> 38:25.280
Calm down.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.080
Calm down, my ass,
they've taken everything!

38:31.120 --> 38:32.680
I'm all alone like a dog.

39:30.680 --> 39:32.280
Look, I know you're not asleep.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.360
Where have you been?

39:46.240 --> 39:47.560
Getting these for you.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.320
You're a jerk.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.080
I know.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.000
Who was that guy today?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.000
Which guy?

40:07.480 --> 40:09.640
That guy this morning, outside the shop.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.160
You looked scared.

40:14.720 --> 40:16.760
No, he just wanted a favor.

40:17.480 --> 40:18.360
Don't worry.

40:19.280 --> 40:20.920
I'm not worried, Amedeo.

40:22.720 --> 40:23.600
And you?

40:40.480 --> 40:41.680
Gabriele?

40:43.240 --> 40:44.360
Hey, Dad.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.280
Change the channel, what's this crap?

40:55.640 --> 40:59.720
Listen, I spoke to Lucio,
that friend of yours,

41:00.080 --> 41:01.920
the one you always say
you're studying with...

41:03.360 --> 41:06.240
He says he hasn't seen you
or heard from you in two weeks.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.600
How many lies have you told me?

41:11.760 --> 41:14.720
Enough! Because then
you start thinking, over and over,

41:14.800 --> 41:16.600
about the weird stuff that's happened.

41:16.680 --> 41:19.800
You always come home late.
You even wrecked the car.

41:19.880 --> 41:23.120
-Don't be a cop with me.
-And you answer me back!

41:24.520 --> 41:26.080
You know what?

41:26.720 --> 41:28.920
I'm not buying your lies anymore.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.240
You can take care of your own life.
I'm over it.

41:33.320 --> 41:34.200
Exactly.

41:34.280 --> 41:35.880
I chose not to be like you.

41:37.680 --> 41:38.920
And what did you choose?

41:40.160 --> 41:43.480
Tell me what the fuck you chose!
Tell me!

41:48.360 --> 41:50.840
Here, you want to change the channel?
Change it!

41:52.080 --> 41:53.960
You're the biggest failure of my life.

43:54.720 --> 43:57.080
It's not exactly
how I dreamed it would be.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.160
How was it?

44:02.680 --> 44:04.440
More energetic.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.440
Like this, huh?

44:21.160 --> 44:22.440
Like this?

44:25.560 --> 44:26.800
Like this?

44:27.760 --> 44:28.760
Like this?

44:43.600 --> 44:45.040
What's happening?

44:50.320 --> 44:51.720
At least look at me.

44:56.880 --> 44:58.320
What the fuck are you doing?

44:58.640 --> 45:00.360
Alberto, don't do anything stupid.

45:30.760 --> 45:32.600
No one must ever know,

45:33.560 --> 45:34.680
understood?

45:51.880 --> 45:53.480
So, Taccon's ours?

45:54.160 --> 45:55.640
I know how to handle him.

45:56.200 --> 45:57.640
Good.

45:58.520 --> 46:01.360
-But there may be a problem.
-Let's hear it.

46:02.120 --> 46:03.720
He wants to hold up everything,

46:04.360 --> 46:07.160
he says there's something murky
with the companies involved.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.360
I know what he'll find out.

46:10.840 --> 46:12.840
What's that asshole going to find out?

46:13.880 --> 46:15.400
That the Mafia's involved.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.040
I'll take care of Taccon,

46:23.680 --> 46:25.320
but we renegotiate our deal.

46:27.240 --> 46:29.360
So far you've done fuck all, Cinaglia.

46:29.880 --> 46:32.280
I'll decide what's right and what's not.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.840
No, not today.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.720
Just for today, you've got to serve
your husband first.

47:07.400 --> 47:10.480
Last night he made you a woman,
now he gets this honor too.

48:20.560 --> 48:22.000
Fuck.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.480
It's like he's staring at me
from in there, too...

49:21.720 --> 49:23.960
and he wants to preach to me as usual.

49:25.080 --> 49:27.080
This time he'd preach to both of us.

49:30.560 --> 49:31.600
No,

49:33.880 --> 49:35.200
he'd be happy.

49:39.160 --> 49:40.680
Because it's right.

49:43.560 --> 49:45.040
It's right for you.

49:50.480 --> 49:53.680
There'll always be a place for you
in the family, Aureliano.

50:01.840 --> 50:04.680
There'll always be a place for you
in the family too.

51:55.600 --> 51:56.920
He called you too?

51:58.520 --> 51:59.680
Know what he wants?

52:01.920 --> 52:03.000
No.

53:11.640 --> 53:13.600
We need to get back together.

53:18.400 --> 53:19.400
Meaning?

53:19.800 --> 53:21.800
Meaning we start over with Friar Fuck.

53:22.920 --> 53:25.920
But this time, we won't take his money.
We'll take his land.

53:28.520 --> 53:29.520
What for?

53:30.000 --> 53:32.160
To spit in the face of certain people.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.680
Samurai first up.

53:36.160 --> 53:40.200
Then me to my sister,
you to that shithead brother of yours...

53:40.280 --> 53:43.080
And you, there must be
someone you wanna spit at...

53:45.960 --> 53:48.440
Fuck our families,
let's take back our lives.

53:51.360 --> 53:52.280
What are you saying?

53:54.960 --> 53:57.960
All this land belongs to my family.
The rest around it belongs to the priest.

53:58.040 --> 54:00.160
We'll take this and that.
It all becomes ours.

54:02.160 --> 54:03.840
But this time, it's serious.

54:05.080 --> 54:08.880
They'll all come after us, politicians,
priests... even that shitbag Samurai.

54:14.960 --> 54:15.840
You in?

54:24.400 --> 54:25.400
Yes or no?

54:33.440 --> 54:34.480
Totally.

54:42.440 --> 54:43.720
Totally.

54:46.760 --> 54:47.720
Totally.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.760
