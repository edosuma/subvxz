32:20.460 --> 32:32.300
buddy.
But midterms are next month, and

32:32.300 --> 32:34.430
that's why my father called for
all Trump hands on deck.

32:34.430 --> 32:38.900
He asked me to stump for
Republicans on the campaign

32:38.900 --> 32:42.000
trail.
He asked me not to do that.

32:42.000 --> 32:48.430
Stay home, Eric.
Yeah.

32:48.430 --> 32:52.560
That's right, bud.
You see all the action on TV.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.260
Fist bump, blow it up.
Ah.

32:55.260 --> 33:01.200
It's not a real exploes.
Just made a noise with my mouth.

33:01.200 --> 33:06.300
It's not magic in any way.
It's just a fist, bud.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.260
My father's confident that that
supposed blue wave isn't making

33:09.260 --> 33:14.230
landfall anytime soon, which I'm
sure makes everyone sad here at

33:14.230 --> 33:16.600
snl, Saturday night liberals.
I'm sorry, I had to do it again.

33:16.600 --> 33:21.800
I'm teasing.
We're on fire.

33:21.800 --> 33:28.530
Maybe we should take over for
jost and che.

33:28.530 --> 33:32.660
I got a joke.
What do the gay black Jews?

33:32.660 --> 33:35.130
No, you can't tell that joke.
But dad does.

33:35.130 --> 33:38.760
No, he does not.
No, he does not.

33:38.760 --> 33:43.700
Yeah, he does.
He does all the voices.

33:43.700 --> 33:46.830
Respectful, a respectful gay
voice.

33:46.830 --> 33:49.900
This week, "the New York
times" reported President Trump

33:49.900 --> 33:54.900
set up sham corporations to
disguise millions in gifts to

33:54.900 --> 33:57.460
avoid taxes.
Our grandfather gave our

33:57.460 --> 34:01.860
father gifts over the years but
it wasn't to avoid taxes.

34:01.860 --> 34:04.730
It was to --
evade taxes.

34:04.730 --> 34:07.660
No.
Eric, you want to play with your

34:07.660 --> 34:11.929
puppet?
That's great, play with that.

34:11.929 --> 34:18.500
Colin, when the left is backed
into a corner.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.460
Eric, you know how a puppet
works.

34:19.460 --> 34:27.500
Put your hand in here, and look.
You can make the mouth move.

34:27.500 --> 34:31.500
Eric, I'm king funny face.
He knows my name.

34:31.500 --> 34:37.060
Yeah.
Everyone knows Eric's name.

34:37.060 --> 34:43.460
He's such a good boy.
Where do you live?

34:43.460 --> 34:45.900
I live in a castle.
I live in a tower.

34:45.900 --> 34:51.760
Okay.
Can I ask you a question?

34:51.760 --> 34:58.560
What did the gay black Jew?
No, okay.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.260
Eric and Donald Trump Jr.,
thank you, everyone.

35:00.260 --> 35:04.330
Thank you, everyone.
A new initiative on the

35:04.330 --> 35:07.760
ballot in Florida this November
that would restore voting rights

35:07.760 --> 35:09.830
to people with felony
convictions.

35:09.830 --> 35:12.700
I think this is a very important
issue, especially when you

35:12.700 --> 35:15.960
consider the millions of black
and brown men that have been

35:15.960 --> 35:19.330
unfairly incarcerated and should
have the right to vote.

35:19.330 --> 35:23.000
Now, if you disagree with me,
let me remind you, it's a very

35:23.000 --> 35:30.400
scary time for young men in
America.

35:30.400 --> 35:35.860
You can be guilty of something
that you may not be guilty of.

35:35.860 --> 35:38.760
It's a good line.
A father at a gender reveal

35:38.760 --> 35:43.700
party used a high velocity arm
to shoot a target that exploded.

35:43.700 --> 35:46.360
So we don't know the gender, but
we do know who's getting

35:46.360 --> 35:55.260
custody.
A popular new trend in los

35:55.260 --> 35:59.360
Angeles are party goats, goats
brought to parties and jump on

35:59.360 --> 36:02.760
people's backs.
Meanwhile, in China, a popular

36:02.760 --> 36:07.460
new trend is studying math and
science.

36:07.460 --> 36:10.560
The makers of Johnny Walker
are introducing a series of

36:10.560 --> 36:15.530
whiskey inspired by "game of
thrones."

36:15.530 --> 36:21.230
It's so strong, you'll forget
she's your aunt.

36:21.230 --> 36:24.900
An 8-year-old in Pennsylvania
has become a barber and gives

36:24.900 --> 36:28.300
free haircuts to kids in the
neighborhood and guess what?

36:28.300 --> 36:34.160
They suck.

36:34.260 --> 36:37.660
A zoo keeper in Denmark
reported a gay penguin couple

36:37.660 --> 36:42.430
abducted a baby penguin while
his parents were swimming.

36:42.430 --> 36:45.630
This according to an e-mail from
my grandma titled forward,

36:45.630 --> 36:50.600
forward, forward, what Obama
did.

36:50.600 --> 36:54.000
Starbucks baristas in Seattle
are saying they are being forced

36:54.000 --> 36:59.200
to dispose of hyperder mik
needles left behind in the

36:59.200 --> 37:04.930
stores every day by drug users.
Meanwhile, over at 7/11, they're

37:04.930 --> 37:07.730
using them as stirrers.
Last week, kanye west

37:07.730 --> 37:10.060
performed on the show and
afterwards, gave unplanned

37:10.060 --> 37:12.460
speech to the audience in
support of Donald Trump.

37:12.460 --> 37:16.430
Here with his reaction to kanye
speech is Pete Davidson.

37:16.430 --> 37:25.160
[ Cheers and applause ]
First off, a lot of people

37:25.160 --> 37:28.160
thought che should be the one to
talk about kanye.

37:28.160 --> 37:32.460
Because che is black but I'm
crazy and we both know which

37:32.460 --> 37:40.630
side of kanye is at the wheel
right now.

37:40.630 --> 37:46.960
So off to a good start.
So speaking strictly for myself,

37:46.960 --> 37:49.430
what kanye said after he went
off the air last week was one of

37:49.430 --> 37:53.160
the worst like most awkward
things I've ever seen here and

37:53.160 --> 37:57.230
I've seen Chevy chase speak to
an intern.

37:57.230 --> 38:02.700
And we all had to stand behind
him and here's what it looked

38:02.700 --> 38:06.130
like.
So I'm on the left, I'm like,

38:06.130 --> 38:07.730
oh.
But I'm like, I want a career.

38:07.730 --> 38:22.900
So I leave.
So kanye was wearing a maga hat.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.960
That's what it's called.
Stupid.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.900
And he started by saying people
backstage tried to bully him

38:28.900 --> 38:32.730
into not wearing it.
He wore it all week, like,

38:32.730 --> 38:36.400
nobody told him not to wear it.
I wish I bullied you.

38:36.400 --> 38:39.100
I wish I suggested that, you
know, it might upset some

38:39.100 --> 38:42.800
people, like, your wife or every
black person ever.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.760
You know?
I wish someone bullied me into

38:44.760 --> 38:52.060
not wearing this hat.
[ Laughter ]

38:52.060 --> 38:54.930
Can you imagine that that
t-shirt was the second stupidest

38:54.930 --> 39:01.430
thing I was wearing that day?
[ Laughter ]

39:01.430 --> 39:04.360
Then kanye said that democrats
broke up black families with

39:04.360 --> 39:08.300
welfare and that slavery is not
real.

39:08.300 --> 39:13.330
You know how wrong about
politics you have to be for me

39:13.330 --> 39:16.100
to notice?
You know how annoying that is?

39:16.100 --> 39:19.030
Kanye is a genius but like a
musical genius.

39:19.030 --> 39:24.030
Like Joey Chestnut is a hot dog
eating genius but I don't want

39:24.030 --> 39:27.160
to hear his opinion about things
that aren't hot dog related.

39:27.160 --> 39:31.960
Yes, there you go.
I agree.

39:31.960 --> 39:33.460
Thank you.
[ Cheers and applause ]

39:33.460 --> 39:37.460
Thanks, guys.
Kanye, I know you're like, this

39:37.460 --> 39:42.200
is the real me.
I'm off the meds.

39:42.200 --> 39:45.930
Take 'em.
No shame in the medicine game.

39:45.930 --> 39:49.200
I'm on them.
It's great.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.100
Take them.
There's nothing wrong with

39:51.100 --> 39:52.930
taking them.
If I ever got on the plane and

39:52.930 --> 39:58.900
the pilot said, I want you to
know, this is the real me

39:58.900 --> 40:01.500
flying.
I'd jump out.

40:01.500 --> 40:08.230
Being mentally ill is not an
excuse to act like a jackass,

40:08.230 --> 40:10.430
okay?
I'm quoting my therapist, my

40:10.430 --> 40:14.430
mom, and my mailman.
Sorry, Carl.

40:14.430 --> 40:17.130
But no, seriously, one time, I
stopped taking my meds and I bit

40:17.130 --> 40:19.530
my mom.
No, it's all good.

40:19.530 --> 40:24.130
I bought her a house.
So is there anything kanye

40:24.130 --> 40:26.430
could do to win you back?
Yeah.

40:26.430 --> 40:28.660
There is.
I'll tell you in a way kanye

40:28.660 --> 40:32.730
understands.
I made this.

40:32.730 --> 40:38.160
Make kanye 2006 again.
Pete Davidson, everyone.

40:38.160 --> 40:41.430
Drop that album.
I'm Michael che.

40:41.430 --> 40:46.130
Where's that album?

40:53.500 --> 40:57.230
Welcome back to "you're
willing to date a magician."

40:57.230 --> 41:01.830
We have four bachelor magicians
hoping to cast a spell on our

41:01.830 --> 41:04.630
contestant, Tracy.
Tracy, why do you want to date a

41:04.630 --> 41:06.100
musician?
Well, I just got out of a 2

41:06.100 --> 41:10.060
year relationship with a dj so
I'm not feeling that picky.

41:10.060 --> 41:14.730
Well, that's fine.
Now let's meet our four single

41:14.730 --> 41:19.930
magicians.
Marconius wild, dividing his

41:19.930 --> 41:23.330
time between Nevada and a parcel
of land outside of Las Vegas,

41:23.330 --> 41:24.700
Nevada.

41:30.130 --> 41:36.430
Tracy, tonight, I am a king.
And I am hoping that you will

41:36.430 --> 41:42.760
be, Tracy, check your pocket.
Oh my god, it's a queen of

41:42.760 --> 41:45.500
hearts.
You're going to want to keep

41:45.500 --> 41:46.430
that.
I need that back, I

41:46.430 --> 41:49.360
appreciate it.
All right, then.

41:49.360 --> 41:54.630
Yes, next is Henry Van dazzle.
He calls himself an artisan

41:54.630 --> 41:58.960
of amazement on his LinkedIn
page.

41:58.960 --> 42:02.730
Charmed, lady.
I said no shackles could hold me

42:02.730 --> 42:07.600
until I met you.
Whoa, that's impressive,

42:07.600 --> 42:09.160
right?
Yeah, it's a cool party

42:09.160 --> 42:11.860
trick.
If only one could be invited

42:11.860 --> 42:20.260
to a party.
Okay, next is Dante raven.

42:20.260 --> 42:23.860
Dante described as a body
endurance artist and the prince

42:23.860 --> 42:28.500
of self-inflicted pain.
Hey, Tracy.

42:28.500 --> 42:35.360
I'm the guy for you.
I once had a billiard ball to

42:35.360 --> 42:39.700
impress valderrama but enough
about me, I better hold my

42:39.700 --> 42:41.100
tongue.
Please.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.600
No more.
Why, why?

42:43.600 --> 42:47.200
She don't like that, Dante.
That's not magic.

42:47.200 --> 42:53.330
Finally, we have justen bird
from the brother and sister

42:53.330 --> 42:57.060
team, byrds of prey.
Fans they their acts violate the

42:57.060 --> 43:01.960
laws of time and space.
Ha-ha.

43:01.960 --> 43:04.100
Indeed.
Those are only some of the laws

43:04.100 --> 43:10.060
my sister and I have violated.
Yeah, he's nice but it's

43:10.060 --> 43:12.430
weird his sister is always with
him.

43:12.430 --> 43:20.230
Don't want my sister around?
I can easily make her disappear.

43:20.230 --> 43:22.430
Vanessa, Vanessa.
Oh.

43:22.430 --> 43:29.460
I thought I lost you.
Okay, Tracy, you are asked to

43:29.460 --> 43:33.130
go on a date with each of our
bachelor magicians.

43:33.130 --> 43:35.230
Let's start with marconius
wilde.

43:35.230 --> 43:47.400
What did you do with him?
He's, he took me to a

43:47.400 --> 43:52.330
bookstore where we browsed for
three hours until he

43:52.330 --> 43:55.230
accidentally found a book he was
mentioned in the thank yous.

43:55.230 --> 44:02.860
It's an intriguing title
called "Houdini's mistress."

44:02.860 --> 44:06.800
Check your pocket, Michelle.
Yeah, I need that back.

44:06.800 --> 44:10.330
All right, then.
Let's go to Henry Van dazzle.

44:10.330 --> 44:12.600
How's your date with him?
A little weird.

44:12.600 --> 44:21.700
He took me to this burlesque
show in Brooklyn.

44:21.700 --> 44:26.000
Thinking man's erotica.
He thought that made it okay

44:26.000 --> 44:29.960
and I saw his idea.
He's 55.

44:29.960 --> 44:36.400
That ID is merely an illusion
I use to get senior discounts at

44:36.400 --> 44:38.600
Denny's.
Okay, dude.

44:38.600 --> 44:42.100
Let's get over to Dante raven.
How did that go?

44:42.100 --> 44:44.400
Dante said he was going to
take me on a freaky journey

44:44.400 --> 44:46.730
inside the mind.
We actually went to a very

44:46.730 --> 44:51.230
modestly priced Italian
restaurant.

44:51.230 --> 44:52.530
Nice.
Later, when they brought the

44:52.530 --> 44:54.860
check, he asked if he could pay
by running a sewing needle

44:54.860 --> 44:57.200
through his testicles.
They said no.

44:57.200 --> 45:01.560
I did it anyway, before I
mastered my pain.

45:01.560 --> 45:12.960
No, Dante.
No.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.600
How about Justin bird?
Where did he take you?

45:16.600 --> 45:21.430
Went to Chile's, which would
have been fine but his sister

45:21.430 --> 45:23.560
kind of stared at me the whole
time.

45:23.560 --> 45:29.860
Kind of like that.
It also got awkward when our

45:29.860 --> 45:33.160
waiter came.
Why is that?

45:33.160 --> 45:39.360
Because it was me.
Waiting tables is my side

45:39.360 --> 45:42.260
hustle.
It's his main hustle.

45:42.260 --> 45:45.500
Okay, Tracy, if you're
willing to go on a moonlit

45:45.500 --> 45:47.700
cruise with one of these guys,
we'll pay for it.

45:47.700 --> 45:53.800
Who will it be?
Marconius?

45:53.800 --> 45:57.400
Henry, Dante or Justin?
Oh, man.

45:57.400 --> 46:02.360
It's so hard to pick one.
Would it be possible to pick

46:02.360 --> 46:03.630
nobody?
Well, that's what happened

46:03.630 --> 46:09.460
last week so let's do it again.
When we come back, we'll tell

46:09.460 --> 46:13.560
you.
Why, Dante, why?

46:13.560 --> 46:18.200
[ Cheers and applause ]

46:22.100 --> 46:23.300
Who got me this?
Jim, was that from you?

46:23.300 --> 46:26.700
It's a little bib that says hot
mess.

46:26.700 --> 46:33.100
Yes, yes, there is this store
that puts gay talk on baby

46:33.100 --> 46:34.300
things.
I couldn't get enough.

46:34.300 --> 46:36.960
What's the door code?
343.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.360
Why?
My girl dede just got you.

46:39.360 --> 46:42.630
What do you mean?
I invited my dog Walker to

46:42.630 --> 46:45.760
come.
To my baby shower?

46:45.760 --> 46:47.760
Why?
Because she's cool and we've

46:47.760 --> 46:51.630
gotten very close through texts
and she's like, somebody I want

46:51.630 --> 46:56.860
to be more like.
Okay, I guess.

46:56.860 --> 46:59.360
Oh, hey, what's up?
I'm dede.

46:59.360 --> 47:03.730
Hi.
Dede, sit down next to me.

47:03.730 --> 47:05.560
Cool party.
Looks like I'm the youngest one

47:05.560 --> 47:08.300
here, pretty dope.
I guess so.

47:08.300 --> 47:12.900
Do you need a plate for that?
Pizza's a plate, right?

47:12.900 --> 47:18.430
That's dede.
Who's the baby shower for?

47:18.430 --> 47:20.500
Me.
I can't believe my due date is

47:20.500 --> 47:22.500
so soon.
Don't be nervous.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.560
We've all been through it.
You'll be fine.

47:24.560 --> 47:28.430
I've had three.
Yeah, I have my Joshua.

47:28.430 --> 47:34.600
Well, we don't all have kids.
I'd need to find a boyfriend

47:34.600 --> 47:39.500
first.
Excuse me, why did everyone

47:39.500 --> 47:42.530
laugh?
Well, she made a little joke.

47:42.530 --> 47:45.730
Is it a joke?
I mean, she doesn't have a

47:45.730 --> 47:48.560
partner.
Is that the funny part?

47:48.560 --> 47:51.560
It's fine.
You're being rude, you know,

47:51.560 --> 47:54.100
the situation.
I know they are but this is

47:54.100 --> 48:00.600
what I'm used to, okay.
It's not like I can say

48:00.600 --> 48:01.560
something.
Where are you going?

48:01.560 --> 48:03.730
Going away.
Look at me.

48:03.730 --> 48:07.000
What's happening?
If you leave right now, they

48:07.000 --> 48:09.030
win.
Is that what you want?

48:09.030 --> 48:12.030
No.
I just, like, I don't need to be

48:12.030 --> 48:14.630
reminded of not having a
boyfriend, you know?

48:14.630 --> 48:17.960
Like, honestly, I've always been
the cutest one.

48:17.960 --> 48:21.630
And I've always had the best
personality and like none of

48:21.630 --> 48:23.760
these girls even dated in high
school.

48:23.760 --> 48:29.100
Like, I did.
So where's my baby?

48:29.100 --> 48:32.060
Hi, why don't we go back to
opening gifts?

48:32.060 --> 48:37.760
This is for me and my triplets.
You upset your friend Carrie.

48:37.760 --> 48:40.960
Get rid of all the baby crap in
this room.

48:40.960 --> 48:43.000
Everybody, get out.
All the baby stuff out of this

48:43.000 --> 48:44.330
room.
We're not doing this to Carrie.

48:44.330 --> 48:51.660
Up, up, up.
No, don't.

48:51.660 --> 48:56.100
Don't rip that down.
This is a baby shower.

48:56.100 --> 49:04.560
My baby shower.
What?

49:04.560 --> 49:06.500
Hey.
Can you stop talking about

49:06.500 --> 49:08.700
yourself for five seconds or
what?

49:08.700 --> 49:12.030
Carrie just opened up her heart.
She said she was prettier

49:12.030 --> 49:14.930
than all of us.
And had a better personality.

49:14.930 --> 49:18.330
That's all you heard?
And now just have to stand here

49:18.330 --> 49:23.060
and stare at your baby.
Hey, uh.

49:23.060 --> 49:28.560
Put that baby in the bedroom.
Uh, no.

49:28.560 --> 49:30.200
Because I'm asking you
nicely.

49:30.200 --> 49:33.360
You put that baby in the bedroom
or I will.

49:33.360 --> 49:35.600
Oh my god, you need to calm
down.

49:35.600 --> 49:38.700
I will tear this place apart
if that's what it takes to get

49:38.700 --> 49:42.800
you to care about your friend.
You've never mentioned

49:42.800 --> 49:45.230
wanting a baby.
I haven't.

49:45.230 --> 49:50.560
I thought about it right now.
I have asked you three times

49:50.560 --> 49:54.230
to put that baby in the
bathroom.

49:54.230 --> 49:57.860
Okay.
Oh my god.

49:57.860 --> 50:02.130
Come on.
Carrie.

50:02.130 --> 50:03.860
I didn't even know you were
looking to date anyone.

50:03.860 --> 50:05.360
Why don't you go out with my
friend Reggie?

50:05.360 --> 50:10.930
He thinks you're really cute.
What, he does?

50:10.930 --> 50:12.400
What?
Yes, I e-mailed you that.

50:12.400 --> 50:15.960
You did?
When?

50:15.960 --> 50:19.800
I threw it out.
Wait, Reggie, oh, he's cute.

50:19.800 --> 50:24.130
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah.

50:24.130 --> 50:26.730
All right, well, this seems
good, feel better?

50:26.730 --> 50:28.900
Yeah.
I want you to remember,

50:28.900 --> 50:32.600
you're better than them
looks-wise and personality-wise.

50:32.600 --> 50:34.400
Don't let them bully you
anymore, okay?

50:34.400 --> 50:36.600
Thanks, girl.
All right, what are we doing?

50:36.600 --> 50:39.360
Shots, presents?
Presents, thank you.

50:39.360 --> 50:42.630
But should we go tell Janet she
can come back?

50:42.630 --> 50:47.400
No, she's been having nervous
gas this whole time.

50:47.400 --> 50:48.930
How do you know it wasn't the
baby?

50:48.930 --> 50:59.300
What does the baby have to be
nervous about?

50:59.300 --> 51:03.200
Super easy to carve.
They should have a blast.

51:03.200 --> 51:09.930
Bye, Sarah.
Say hi to Josh.

51:09.930 --> 51:16.130
Hey, team?
Can I talk to you for a sec?

51:16.130 --> 51:19.330
Yes, sir.
This morning, I found some of

51:19.330 --> 51:22.800
our jumbo pumpkins in the
dumpster.

51:22.800 --> 51:27.660
Some of the pumpkins had holes
cut in them and others were

51:27.660 --> 51:31.630
completely destroyed.
So I cannot believe I have to

51:31.630 --> 51:37.230
ask you this, but did you
perform a lewd act with some of

51:37.230 --> 51:41.930
our pumpkins last night?
No, sir.

51:41.930 --> 51:47.100
All right, well, Louis, the
grounds keeper, saw you, and he

51:47.100 --> 51:49.400
told me what you did.
Right, yes.

51:49.400 --> 51:51.630
And that's because we did do
what you said, sir.

51:51.630 --> 51:54.500
Enough lies, we did do that,
sir.

51:54.500 --> 51:58.300
Do you guys see how this
would be a problem?

51:58.300 --> 52:04.730
That employees of my pumpkin
patch are having sex with the

52:04.730 --> 52:07.130
pumpkins?
I mean, it's not ideal, sir.

52:07.130 --> 52:09.160
I think there's been a
misunderstanding.

52:09.160 --> 52:11.160
They only did it because it felt
good.

52:11.160 --> 52:12.930
Exactly.
That doesn't change my

52:12.930 --> 52:16.300
opinion.
It doesn't change your

52:16.300 --> 52:18.160
opinion on us as people?
Yes.

52:18.160 --> 52:22.260
For worse?
Yeah.

52:22.260 --> 52:26.760
Poor Louis.
He saw the entire thing.

52:26.760 --> 52:29.200
So let me tell you our side
of the story as to clear the air

52:29.200 --> 52:31.500
here?
Sure, Tom.

52:31.500 --> 52:34.000
Let's paint a picture for
you, sir.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.030
Kind of a horny night in
general.

52:36.030 --> 52:39.130
We were talking about that
film, "American pie."

52:39.130 --> 52:42.300
There's a part where Jason
Briggs does dirty deeds with

52:42.300 --> 52:45.530
American pie.
This one time at band camp.

52:45.530 --> 52:48.200
This is where I'll take some
responsibility because I had

52:48.200 --> 52:53.900
dared Nathan.
So to my surprise, it felt

52:53.900 --> 52:57.430
very, very good.
Upon hearing my friend's

52:57.430 --> 53:00.660
happy noises, I decided to grab
a couple pumpkins and do the

53:00.660 --> 53:05.530
same myself.
You guys, this is a family

53:05.530 --> 53:08.200
business.
Kids come here with their

53:08.200 --> 53:11.400
parents.
There's a slide.

53:11.400 --> 53:16.430
I can't have my employees
pumping the pumpkins and Nathan,

53:16.430 --> 53:20.800
I'd expect this from Todd but
pretty disappointed in you,

53:20.800 --> 53:22.960
Nathan.
I thought you were pretty smart,

53:22.960 --> 53:27.260
so for you to do this to a
pumpkin.

53:27.260 --> 53:29.460
You've got anything to say for
yourself, man?

53:29.460 --> 53:32.760
I'm embarrassed.
This is not our finest hour.

53:32.760 --> 53:34.800
To be caught doing that with a
pumpkin?

53:34.800 --> 53:38.560
You had sex with it.
By someone, my boss, who's

53:38.560 --> 53:42.800
also the father of my wife?
I'm your father-in-law.

53:42.800 --> 53:45.830
I will never do this again.
I can't promise that but I'll

53:45.830 --> 53:48.360
try my hardest not to.
I might do it.

53:48.360 --> 53:54.860
Sir, in our defense, have you
ever done that with a pumpkin?

53:54.860 --> 53:56.500
No.
It feels legit.

53:56.500 --> 54:00.230
Todd used a condom.
It makes it even weirder.

54:00.230 --> 54:02.960
Oh.
Now, surprise guys.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:14.730
I have all your movies.
And I have no idea who either

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:19.900
of us is.
Well, this week marks the one

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:23.460
year anniversary of the Harvey
weinstein story.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:27.030
Despite the strides Hollywood
has made, what still needs to

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:29.000
change?
Some of the men producers are

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.200
terrified to get alone with a
woman.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:36.360
Stop shouting us out.
They need to give bad men

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.800
second chances.
Stop using fingerprints when

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:43.130
they commit party murders.
I'm sorry, what?

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:46.560
It's a huge problem in
Hollywood.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.900
They'll have a party in a house
in palm spring.

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.160
Some girl takes a nap in the
tool and then they're all,

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.130
please, baby, just touch the
knife.

01:00:56.130 --> 01:01:00.100
I'll buy you a sweater.
Be a pal.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.300
You girls know what I'm talking
about.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:05.000
No, I've never experienced
anything like that.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.230
Okay, see.
Progress.

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:14.130
How do you all think that the
movement has spread to the

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:17.230
culture at large?
You see, with politics now,

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:20.800
more women are coming forward.
Let me tell you, these

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.230
politicians can defend their
supreme court justice all they

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:26.730
want, but usually when there's
smoke, there's fire.

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:29.460
And when there's fire,
there's Rita Hayworth taking a

01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:36.530
cigarette nap.
That sleepy bitch.

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:38.630
You can see in those
hearings, you know there's a

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:44.460
double standard.
If a woman acted the way he did,

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:50.330
she'd be labeled hysterical.
I was labeled hysterical

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:54.530
once.
I asked they will them to clean

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:57.200
costume.
They sent me to a spa to relax

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:02.100
and get a lobotomy.
Now cannot think or smell.

01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:07.060
Oh my god, are you okay?
I think so.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:11.560
How has the movement affected
the types of roles you're being

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.830
offered?
It's exciting that this has

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:15.760
sort of compounded the existing
conversation surrounding

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.360
representation.
There's so many more roles for

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.960
Asian women where before, there
were almost none.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.930
That's not true.
There were plenty of fabulous

01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:27.060
parts for Asian gals in the
1940s.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:31.900
And I played all of them.
That's offensive.

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:36.130
No, it's not, cinder ho.
I was a brunette.

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:41.600
What's the damn problem?
I'm going to ignore all of

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:44.830
that, because I really like her.
I think this moment is an

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.860
opportunity women are coming
forward with stories from a long

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:49.860
time ago and they need to be
heard.

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:52.860
I actually would like to come
forward about something that

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:58.260
happened to me a long time ago.
I was babysitting for a very

01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.360
powerful family.
Have you heard of the

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.360
lindberghs?
Yeah, wait, did you lose the

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:09.360
Lindbergh baby?
Well, ish.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.460
I left him on a porch with a
sign that said famous baby,

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:16.530
please don't steal.
What could I do?

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:20.700
I had an audition.
Silver lining, I booked it.

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:25.900
I was the queen of siel.
I'm just going to reset

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:30.560
because my boss is here.
Do you think there's a place for

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.760
men in this movement?
Absolutely.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.160
We need male allies.
Right, male allies.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:40.760
That means gay husband, right?
I had a lot of male allies.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.800
I just want to say there are
plenty of good men who

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.930
collaborate with women and
respect their ideas.

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:48.300
I had that kind of
relationship with Orson Wells

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:53.000
when he made king.
I gave him the idea for a Rose

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.600
bud but not talking about a darn
sled.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:04.300
I'm talking about my wet.
I'm afraid we're out of time.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:18.860
Time for my cigarette nap.
Can we dim the lights please?

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:27.230
Thanks to Travis Scott.
I love you, grandma, I love you,

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:29.230
dad.
Good night!

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:37.515
