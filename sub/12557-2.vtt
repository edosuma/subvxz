HOLMES?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.297
OR IS THAT PART
JUST ELEMENTARY?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.927
MAYBE THEY HID
IN THE RESTROOM.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.258
SNEAKED OUT
AFTER I LEFT.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.968

09:23.063 --> 09:25.270
THAT'S QUITE AN IMAGINATION, MR.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.477
NO, I DON'T KNOW.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.811
IT GETS ME.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.567

THIS, THOUGH.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.732
I GET SPOOKED JUST

BUT I'\/E GOT A PASSEL OF NEVVSMEN
OUT THERE BUGGING ME TO DEATH

09:54.260 --> 09:56.171
AS TO WHAT KIND
OF HAUNTED OPERATIONS

09:56.262 --> 09:57.673
WE ARE RUNNING HERE.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.596
TELL THEM TO KEEP
THEIR SHIRTS ON.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.678
THAT'S VVHAT <i>YOU</i>
SHOULD BE TELLING THEM

10:01.768 --> 10:04.100
OR A REASONABLE FACSIMILE
OF AN EXPLANATION.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.931
THEN YOU BETTER GET
ME ANOTHER HEAD

10:06.022 --> 10:08.309
BECAUSE I'\/E BEEN ON
THAT PHONE FOR SIX HOURS.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.857
I'VE HAD EVERY NEVVS
SERVICE, TELEVISION NETWORK

THE GREAT BIG MYSTERY IS

10:15.740 --> 10:17.572
WE'RE SUPPOSED

10:17.659 --> 10:19.320
YOU KNOW HOW LONG
I CAN KEEP IT UP?

10:19.410 --> 10:20.821
MAYBE ANOTHER 15 MINUTES

10:20.912 --> 10:22.653
THEN THE WHOLE THING
WILL POP OPEN

10:25.166 --> 10:26.748

10:26.835 --> 10:28.701
VVILL TAKE OUR FRANCHISE
AVVAY FROM US.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.661

10:34.467 --> 10:36.504
EVERY NAME ON THIS
PASSENGER MANIFEST?

10:36.594 --> 10:38.301
NO, I HAVE NOT.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.550

IS TO HA\/E A SMALL ARMY

CLUTCHING AT MY LAPELS, ASKING
ME FOR A DEFINITl\/E STATEMENT

10:45.979 --> 10:47.720
AS TO WHERE
THEIR LOVED ONES ARE

10:47.814 --> 10:50.226
VVHO TOOK FLIGHT 107 OUT
OF BUFFALO THIS MORNING.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.398
YOU HAVEN'T E\/EN HAD
ONE INQUIRY YET?

10:52.485 --> 10:55.853
NOW, THAT'S WEIRD,
ISN'T IT?

10:55.947 --> 10:58.439
NOT A SINGLE INQUIRY.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.570
BUT THE SHIP ARRIVED
ONLY SIX HOURS AGO.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.992
MAYBE THEY HA\/EN'T HAD
TIME TO MISS ANYONE.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.529
NO, I'M
KIDDING MYSELF.

11:05.623 --> 11:10.493
OF COURSE, SOMEONE VVOULD HA\/E
MADE AN INQUIRY BY NOVV.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.380
THERE GOES
THAT OLD FEELING AGAIN.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.380
<i>[suspense music]</i>
WHAT <i>FEELING?</i>

11:20.471 --> 11:26.012
THIS PASSENGER MANIFEST. THE
NAMES LOOK SO FAMILIAR.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.626
ROBBINS, YOU SAID
SOMETHING BEFORE.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.708
<i>WHAT DO YOU MEAN'?
ABOUT THE PARACHUTES'?</i>

11:59.761 --> 12:02.128
NO, NO, NO,
YOU SAID SOMETHING ELSE.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.463
YOU SAID YOU LOOKED
INSIDE THE PLANE

12:04.557 --> 12:06.139
AND YOU SAW THE BLUE SEATS.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.137
<i>YEAH, I SAID
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.</i>

12:08.228 --> 12:10.219
THEY ARE BLUE,

12:10.313 --> 12:13.226
BUT VVHEN I FIRST LOOKED IN THE
PLANE, THE SEATS VVERE BROVVN.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.681
<i>WAIT, THEY WERE RED.</i>

12:14.776 --> 12:16.437
I REMEMBER
HOW FADED THEY WERE,

12:16.527 --> 12:18.268
BUT THEY
<i>WERE</i> RED.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.149
<i>(Malloy) WHAT IS
ALL THIS NONSENSE?</i>

12:20.240 --> 12:22.151
HAVEN'T WE GOT ENOUGH TROUBLE

12:22.242 --> 12:25.576
VVITHOUT YOU GUYS VVORRYING
ABOUT THE INTERIOR DECORATION?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.832
<i>(Sheckly)
BENGSTON, COME HERE.</i>

12:34.921 --> 12:37.083
DO YOU SEE A NUMBER
ON THAT TAIL?

12:37.173 --> 12:38.459
OF COURSE,
I SEE A NUMBER.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.960
READ IT OFF TO ME.

12:40.051 --> 12:45.012
<i>(Bengston)
N-6-7-5-8-8.</i>

12:45.098 --> 12:48.591
HEY, ROBBINS.

12:48.685 --> 12:52.178
DO YOU SEE THAT SAME
NUMBER ON THE TAIL?

12:52.272 --> 12:54.354
<i>(Robbins)
N-8-O-4-7-5-8.</i>

12:54.440 --> 12:56.181
(Malloy) HEY, ARE
WE GOING CRAZY?

12:56.276 --> 12:58.938
WE'RE ALL SEEING
DIFFERENT NUMBERS.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.316
GENTLEMEN, I HAVE A THEORY.

13:02.407 --> 13:06.321
UNFORTUNATELY, THE ONLY WAY
I CAN PROVE IT OR DISPROVE IT

13:06.411 --> 13:09.278
IS GOING TO PUT ME
IN CONSIDERABLE JEOPARDY.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.955
ANY ONE OF YOU EVER HEAR
OF MASS SUGGESTION?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.956
SO?

13:17.046 --> 13:19.299
I THINK THAT'S VVHAT
VVE'RE DEALING VVITH NOVV-

13:19.382 --> 13:21.498
A KIND OF HYPNOSIS.
TO PUT IT MORE BLUNTLY

13:21.592 --> 13:23.458
OR PERHAPS A LITTLE
LESS BELIEVABLY,

13:23.553 --> 13:27.137
I DON'T THINK THIS
AIRPLANE IS REALLY HERE,

13:27.223 --> 13:28.884
<i>I THINK EVERY
ONE OF US</i>

13:28.975 --> 13:31.342
<i>HAD A LITTLE HYPNOSIS
PERFORMED ON HIM,</i>

13:31.436 --> 13:33.393
A LITTLE SUGGESTION.

13:33.479 --> 13:37.017
SOMEONE SOMEWHERE TOLD US THAT
A DC-3 IS INSIDE THIS HANGAR

13:37.108 --> 13:38.849
AND THAT IT LANDED
THIS MORNING.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.559
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.894
SO EVERY ONE OF US
HAD PICTURED IN HIS MIND

13:42.989 --> 13:44.650
A DC-3 AS HE KNOWS ONE.

13:44.699 --> 13:48.408
THEREFORE, ONE OF US
SEES THE SEATS AS BLUE,

13:48.494 --> 13:51.077
ANOTHER SEES THEM AS BROWN,

13:51.164 --> 13:53.405
STILL ANOTHER
SEES THEM AS RED.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.831
I READ ONE NUMBER
OFF THE TAIL.

13:55.918 --> 13:59.536
<i>TWO OTHER GUYS
READ TWO OTHERS.</i>

13:59.630 --> 14:03.919
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY?

14:06.804 --> 14:09.512
THIS PARTICULAR AIRCRAFT
DOESN'T EXIST.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.174
IT REALLY ISN'T
HERE AT ALL.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.975
ARE YOU MAD?

14:14.062 --> 14:15.769
ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL US

14:15.855 --> 14:17.437
THIS IS
AN ILLUSION?

14:17.523 --> 14:19.560
IT'S NO ILLUSION,
IT'S HERE.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.311
I CAN FEEL IT,
IT'S HERE.

14:21.402 --> 14:24.770
I'M GOING TO PROVE TO
YOU THAT YOU'RE VVRONG,

14:24.864 --> 14:28.402
OR I'M GOING TO PROVE
TO YOU THAT I'M WRONG.

14:28.493 --> 14:32.782
AND IF I HAPPEN TO BE WRONG,
I ALSO HAPPEN TO BE DEAD.

14:32.872 --> 14:39.289
ROBBINS, VVILL YOU ROLL THE PLANE
OUTSIDE AND START THE ENGINES?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.541

KNOVV VVHAT YOU'RE DOING?

15:14.705 --> 15:16.992
I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.041
START THE ENGINES.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.753
IF THIS PLANE
IS IMAGINARY,

15:23.798 --> 15:27.291
THEN SO ARE THOSE ENGINES
AND SO ARE THOSE PROPS.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.342
SO IF I STICK
MY HAND IN THEM,

15:29.429 --> 15:31.340
NOTHING IS GOING
TO HAPPEN.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.763
BUT IF MY THEORY
IS FOR THE BIRDS

15:33.850 --> 15:35.557
AND THOSE PROPS
ARE REAL,

15:37.019 --> 15:39.181

NOTIFY MY WIFE.
