00:26.026 --> 00:29.072
The day before Christmas.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.205
Remember when we would
get excited about that?

00:31.248 --> 00:35.165
Well, it's hard to get excited when
Santa refuses to give us any presents.

00:35.209 --> 00:37.994
What did we ever do to have
him treat us like this.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.301
We kept him from taking
over all the holidays.

00:40.344 --> 00:43.173
We were fools to try to
stop that jolly fat man.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.088
Now there will be no gifts
under the tree

00:45.132 --> 00:46.698
and our stockings
will remain empty.

00:47.308 --> 00:48.439
Forever.

00:48.483 --> 00:50.789
It can't be.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.704
We've got gifts.

00:52.748 --> 00:54.663
Santa actually brought us gifts?

00:54.706 --> 00:56.621
And delivered them early, baby.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.237
- Coal?
- This is coal.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.021
Santa brought us nothing but...

01:05.065 --> 01:06.196
Coal.

01:10.548 --> 01:13.247
We got coal!

01:13.290 --> 01:15.466
All aboard.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.860
- Coal!
- Coal!

01:17.903 --> 01:18.948
Coal, coal.

01:18.991 --> 01:20.906
Coal!

01:20.950 --> 01:23.953
Coal is the power
energizing the world.

01:23.996 --> 01:27.304
Best Christmas ever!

01:27.348 --> 01:29.306
No! No, no!

01:29.350 --> 01:30.916
Santa Claus?

01:30.960 --> 01:32.701
Coal is a garbage gift.

01:32.744 --> 01:35.225
Only terrible children get coal.

01:35.269 --> 01:38.315
Everyone knows that.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.143
So you're still mad at us?

01:40.187 --> 01:43.059
Of course I'm still mad
at you, hence, the coal.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.279
Well, I'm keeping my coal.
I love it.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.237
Wait, how did you get in here?

01:47.281 --> 01:49.239
We do not have the chimney.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.633
A little Christmas magic.

01:51.676 --> 01:52.808
Friends.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.378
Just tell us
what you're doing here.

01:57.421 --> 02:00.337
I've decided that if I
can't have every holiday

02:00.381 --> 02:02.426
I don't want any holidays.

02:02.470 --> 02:03.906
And that's right.

02:03.949 --> 02:07.170
Santa Claus
is quitting Christmas!

02:08.389 --> 02:09.607
Wow!

02:09.651 --> 02:11.522
You trying to shock us?
'Cause it didn't work.

02:11.566 --> 02:14.438
Yeah, we don't get presents,
anyway. So what if you quit.

02:14.482 --> 02:17.180
It's not just you
who won't get presents.

02:17.224 --> 02:20.966
It's every child in the world.
Whee!

02:21.010 --> 02:22.446
He's right.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.796
No presents
on Christmas morning?

02:24.840 --> 02:26.537
You monster.

02:26.581 --> 02:29.671
You cannot abandon your
duty to the human children.

02:29.714 --> 02:33.370
You don't get it.
It's over, I'm done.
Merry Christmas.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.590
You garbage kids.

02:38.984 --> 02:41.378
Garbage kids!

02:41.422 --> 02:43.815
Is Christmas
really gone forever?

02:43.859 --> 02:46.949
No, I have a plan.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.256
All right, I've run
the simulations.

02:49.299 --> 02:53.521
Without toys, the children of the world
will reach peak sadness levels by breakfast.

02:53.564 --> 02:55.175
Scary, yo.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.786
Then we must wish
for the Christmas miracle.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.354
No, we are
the Christmas miracle.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.965
The Teen Titans,
are going to save Christmas.

03:03.008 --> 03:04.401
By reminding the world
that the holiday

03:04.445 --> 03:06.316
shouldn't focus entirely
on material goods?

03:06.360 --> 03:09.711
By filling in for Santa and
delivering all of the Christmas gifts.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.322
Sounds crazy enough
to work. I like it!

03:12.366 --> 03:16.196
Glad to hear it, because as our resident
engineer, you'll be building the sleigh.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.632
I'll get my wrenches
and all that stuff.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.373
Beast Boy,
you'll be our reindeer.

03:19.416 --> 03:20.417
That's what's up.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.813
Star, Raven,
you'll be the Christmas elves.

03:24.856 --> 03:28.338
You'll be responsible for making all
the toys for the good girls and boys.

03:28.382 --> 03:31.820
We'll work around the clock
until our hands bleed.
But what about you?

03:31.863 --> 03:35.258
I'll take on the role
of the jolly fat man himself.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.565
But you're so skinny dude.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.480
And the facial hair is lacking.

03:40.785 --> 03:43.223
Yeah. Santa needs a gut
and a beard.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.615
You'd make a better elf.

03:44.659 --> 03:47.401
We should ask Sticky Joe
to be Santa.

03:47.444 --> 03:51.274
- Howdy.
- Just look at this great beard.

03:51.318 --> 03:54.625
And his belly.
So plump.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.410
He's the perfect Santa, yo.

03:56.453 --> 04:00.414
I am not trusting the holiday
to some filthy Bohemian.

04:00.457 --> 04:01.850
Beat it, Sticky Joe!

04:01.893 --> 04:03.591
I'm Santa and that's final.

04:03.634 --> 04:06.333
Now, the children of the
world are depending on us.

04:06.376 --> 04:07.856
Titans, go!

04:37.886 --> 04:40.454
- Looking good, bro.
- Oh, yeah!

04:40.497 --> 04:43.935
Twin turbo engines powered by
a nuclear fusion reactor.

04:43.979 --> 04:47.504
This baby's gonna spread Christmas
cheer at twice the speed of sound.

04:47.548 --> 04:50.507
Whoa, that's a lot of toys, mama.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.030
Y'all been hard to work, huh?

04:52.074 --> 04:54.642
The life of a Christmas elf
is one of suffering.

04:54.685 --> 04:59.473
- Our hands are ruined from the toy making.
- Ugh.

04:59.516 --> 05:02.476
Who knew Christmas cheer
came at such a cost.

05:02.519 --> 05:06.349
Did someone say Christmas cheer?

05:06.393 --> 05:11.354
Merry Christmas, boys and girls.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.530
Dude, how much weight
did you gain?

05:13.574 --> 05:17.926
Enough that my belly, jiggles
like a bowl full of jelly.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.580
Ho...

05:19.623 --> 05:22.322
Oh! Your poor, poor heart.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.108
We should get you to a hospital.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.896
Nonsense.

05:31.940 --> 05:35.117
Now let's get these toys
in the sleigh.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.946
Raven.

05:37.989 --> 05:43.386
It's time for the Teen Titans,
to save Christmas.

05:45.954 --> 05:48.260
Ho, ho, ho.

05:50.045 --> 05:55.137
Okay, first house.
Here we go.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.791
Dude, how you gonna get in?

05:56.834 --> 05:59.010
Through the chimney, obviously.

06:01.273 --> 06:02.492
Come on, bro.

06:02.536 --> 06:04.320
What?

06:04.364 --> 06:07.584
You should perhaps reconsider due
to your recently expanded girth.

06:07.628 --> 06:10.370
Why don't you just use some
of Santa's Christmas magic?

06:11.806 --> 06:13.460
Absolutely not.

06:13.503 --> 06:17.638
I'm Santa, and Santa
goes down the chimney.

06:21.468 --> 06:24.122
Wo-ho, it's a little tight.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.559
But if I can...

06:25.602 --> 06:27.561
Just get the leg past the...

06:27.604 --> 06:29.824
Wo-ho-ho, that's broken.

06:29.867 --> 06:34.437
Ho-ho, no biggie.
Ow, just need a little help here guys.

06:34.481 --> 06:37.875
I got you, dude, with a little help
from the 'ol Christmas shablamo.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.357
Ho-ho, ow, ho-ho, ow.

06:44.273 --> 06:46.841
All right, I'm in.

06:46.884 --> 06:50.453
Two presents under the tree and... Oh, my.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.803
They have a dog.
Hey, there little...

06:54.326 --> 06:56.241
Ah, get me out!
Get me out now!

06:56.285 --> 06:59.114
I think this calls for some
of that Christmas Magic, yo.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.945
Ow, ow, so fun!

07:03.988 --> 07:08.645
Ha-ha, merry Christmas.

07:08.689 --> 07:10.473
Not bad for
your first time, bruh.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.475
Uh, how many more houses
do we have to visit?

07:12.519 --> 07:14.782
Approximately seven billion.

07:14.825 --> 07:18.263
Wait, do you hear that?

07:20.614 --> 07:22.703
Ho-ho-ho.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.574
Ho-ho-hoo.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.489
What are you doing, Santa?

07:26.533 --> 07:30.580
Hey, only Santa says ho-ho-ho.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.974
Ho-ho-ho.

07:33.017 --> 07:35.455
No-ho-oh.

07:35.498 --> 07:38.501
Ho-ho-hooo.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.633
Ho-ho-ho.

07:39.676 --> 07:43.854
I'm Santa now.
Ho-ho-hooo.

07:43.898 --> 07:47.641
That's right. Look at this belly.

07:47.684 --> 07:50.687
Son, you should see
a doctor about that.

07:50.731 --> 07:54.648
Blah-blah, I will,
after we save Christmas.

07:54.691 --> 07:59.740
I told you Christmas is over.

07:59.783 --> 08:02.090
What do you care?
You gave Christmas up.

08:02.133 --> 08:08.705
I knew if the world missed even one Christmas,
they'd be desperate to have me back.

08:08.749 --> 08:15.059
But I'd only return if they gave
me all the other holidays, too.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.105
Holiday magic.

08:17.148 --> 08:22.893
Now you garbage kids are
trying to ruin it all for me.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.506
Ugh, evasive maneuvers.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.737
Engine one is down.

08:40.781 --> 08:43.697
We can't outrun him.
Elves, battle stations.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.701
Yeah.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.747
- Ka-ka-ka!
- Ka-ka-ka!

08:50.791 --> 08:52.967
Ho-ho-ho!

08:53.010 --> 08:54.316
No.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.579
We're going down.

08:56.623 --> 08:57.798
Ugh.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.759
Anyone have eyes on Santa?

09:02.803 --> 09:04.718
Nothing on the scanner.

09:04.761 --> 09:07.590
Watch your backs, Kris Kringle,
doesn't go down that easy.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.810
Starfire, Raven, get the toys.

09:13.814 --> 09:17.774
It's over, you garbage kids.

09:17.818 --> 09:20.298
You ruined Christmas, Santa.

09:20.342 --> 09:23.737
I made Christmas
and I can destroy it.

09:23.780 --> 09:29.699
And now, Christmas is over,
forever, and so are you.

09:32.441 --> 09:37.185
- Who's that?
- No, oh, it can't be.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.883
Ho-ho-howdy.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.798
Sticky Joe.

09:41.842 --> 09:44.888
You despicable bohemian.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.458
- Ooh!
- Ha-ha-ha!

09:49.501 --> 09:51.678
You're the garbage person
now, Santa.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.202
Thank you, Sticky Joe.

09:54.245 --> 09:56.117
But all the presents
have been destroyed.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.814
Howdy.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.340
- Beans?
- This is beans?

10:02.384 --> 10:05.474
- Sticky Joe has brought us.
- Beans.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.437
We got beans!

10:12.481 --> 10:14.483
All aboard.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.877
- Beans!
- Beans!

10:16.920 --> 10:17.791
Beans, beans.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.923
Beans!

10:19.967 --> 10:23.057
A can of beans
for every kid in the world!

10:23.100 --> 10:26.016
Best Christmas ever!
