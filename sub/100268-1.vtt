Huh? What do you think?

02:48.793 --> 02:50.336
What am I looking at here?

02:50.420 --> 02:53.381
You’re looking at a ten-second car,
my friend.

02:53.464 --> 02:56.676
I’m about to break Dom's record,
set on this very road,

02:57.093 --> 02:59.304
becoming the next great street racer.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.180
-This sounds familiar.
-Mm-hmm.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.516
-As if we heard it last month?
-Mm-hmm.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.685
-And the month before that?
-Mm-hmm!

03:05.768 --> 03:09.314
You realize all those times they mention,
your car blew up.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.358
This time will be different!
I was born to win!

03:12.442 --> 03:14.652

03:28.791 --> 03:30.960
I got room in here for a queen.

What's up, Mitch?
Moved from car thief to jet rustler?

03:44.933 --> 03:46.601
Maybe. Don't worry about it.

03:46.684 --> 03:50.480
Hey, Toretto!
Let’s see what that soap box racer can do.

03:50.563 --> 03:55.109
After you lose I’ll let you detail my car.
The closest you’ll get to a winner.

03:55.193 --> 03:58.071
Yeah, well, after you lose,
you can wash my car.

03:58.154 --> 04:00.615
It’s the closest you’ll get to a shower.

04:00.698 --> 04:02.575
[engines growl]

04:06.496 --> 04:10.625
Tony, you can’t win, bro. You don’t have
enough power to beat a rocket.

04:10.708 --> 04:13.086
Cisco, you know what my cousin Dom says:

04:13.169 --> 04:15.296
it’s not the car, it’s the driver.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.465
Hope you brought your buff rags!

04:17.966 --> 04:19.092
You’re a buff rag!

04:19.425 --> 04:20.343
The buffest!

04:20.426 --> 04:22.637
-What are you talking about?
-I dunno.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.763
Frostee,

04:24.764 --> 04:26.683
-[Tony]  start us up!
-You got it.

[drone engine buzzes]

04:35.775 --> 04:36.943
[Frostee]   Ready...

Aw, that's sweet, Tony.
But I'm about to "rocket."

Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

05:06.639 --> 05:09.267
[Mitch shouting] I won!

05:09.350 --> 05:11.728
-Does he know how to stop?
-[Mitch] Whoa!

[crash, glass breaks]

05:13.229 --> 05:15.106

05:16.357 --> 05:18.067
I can’t believe he beat me.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.111
It wasn’t even close that time.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.780
You weren’t even in the same state as him.

05:22.864 --> 05:26.075
-You wanna watch the replay?
-No, Frostee, I don’t.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.996
You won't beat a rocket-powered car
with an engine from the dump.

05:30.246 --> 05:34.167
Hey, this engine is solid, all right?
The fuel hose just got loose.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.252
Nothing a little gum can’t fix.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.673
It’ll take more than gum
to try to beat my best time.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.592
-Dom's back!
-What’s up, Dom!

05:42.675 --> 05:43.843
What up!

05:43.926 --> 05:44.761
Hey, Dom.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.971
Looks like you pushed it too hard.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.515
-[Tony sighs]
-Reminds me of someone.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.351
I thought I had it.
I hate losing to that guy!

05:52.435 --> 05:55.688
That’s because you’re a Toretto.
You’re born to win.

05:55.772 --> 06:00.151
Remember, being a Toretto has nothing
to do with what you do in that car.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.945
Being a Toretto is about what’s in here.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.782
[Dom] Will it make it home?

06:05.865 --> 06:08.534
Maybe not in record time,
but it’ll make it.

06:08.868 --> 06:12.580
Right, I’ll see you later.
I got something to talk to you about.

06:15.374 --> 06:16.751

they might not be working alone.

07:03.631 --> 07:04.674
What do we do?

07:04.757 --> 07:08.136
[Tony] Split up. Shake the bikes.
Frostee, track the van.

-I'm on it.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.114
[Cisco] We won't outrun them.

07:28.197 --> 07:30.783
We need a place we can go and they can’t.

07:30.867 --> 07:31.868
I got it.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.371

-[Echo]  Yeah, we’re having fun.

Oh yeah, y’all ‘bout to get shook.

Aw, yeah! Whoo!

08:12.992 --> 08:14.702
[Echo laughs]

08:17.788 --> 08:18.873
I lost my bikers.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.043
-[Echo]  You okay Tony?
-[Tony]  No, still covered.

08:23.377 --> 08:26.964
-[Tony]  Got the van?
-[Frostee]  Locked and headed to it now.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.884
Okay. Shoot me the location,
I’ll meet you there.

08:29.967 --> 08:32.136
-[engine rattles]
-Oh, no, no, no!

08:32.220 --> 08:35.640
My fuel line is loose again.
I gotta ditch these guys.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.352
[energetic music plays]

09:08.422 --> 09:09.507
[Echo] Tony! Wait!

09:09.590 --> 09:12.385
-[Cisco] We don’t know what’s in there!
-Dom is!

09:14.220 --> 09:16.138
-[woman] And... time!
-What?

09:16.514 --> 09:19.350
See? I told you they were the best.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.061
Could have been faster,
but we’ll work on it.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.567
What’s happening? Who are they?
Are you okay?

09:27.900 --> 09:32.280
You think a couple of guys could pull up
and kidnap me? That takes an army.

09:32.363 --> 09:36.284
This is Ms. Nowhere. I’ve worked
with her organization in the past.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.077
And now she needs your help.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.955
[stammering] I’m sorry, what’s your name?

09:41.205 --> 09:43.499
Nowhere. Ms. Nowhere.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.544
Uh, I’m still confused. Where are you?

09:47.044 --> 09:51.007
I’m here, but you know... Wink.
I’m not here. Get it?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.550
Did you just say “wink”?

09:52.633 --> 09:55.720
I’ll cut to the chase.
I need a crew of street racers

09:55.803 --> 09:58.889
to infiltrate a criminal organization
called SH1FT3R.

09:58.973 --> 09:59.974
[shouting] Gary!

10:00.433 --> 10:03.394
[Ms. Nowhere]
They’re led by this man, Shashi Dhar,

10:03.477 --> 10:05.563
master thief and adrenaline junkie.

10:05.646 --> 10:09.525
SH1FT3R hosts races that serve as cover
for his massive heists.

10:09.609 --> 10:14.196
He recently stole over three billion
dollars from Silicon Valley’s richest men.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.157
Why do you need us? Dom’s here.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.199
[laughs]

10:17.283 --> 10:22.496
There’s no way I could show up at a race
without everybody recognizing me.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.375
She needs a group of new agents.
And I recommended you.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.628
[Dom] You’re out racing anyway.

10:28.711 --> 10:32.548
This way you do some good and
Ms. Nowhere can watch your back.

10:32.965 --> 10:38.179
So you want us to be
undercover spy racers? Dope!

10:38.262 --> 10:42.183
If you know Shashi is stealing the money,
why don’t you arrest him?

10:42.558 --> 10:44.852
You don’t earn the name “Ms. Nowhere”

10:44.935 --> 10:47.730
by being a security guard for tech nerds!

10:47.813 --> 10:49.190
You had to earn it?

10:49.273 --> 10:53.194
You’re one to talk, Echo,
or should I say... Margaret.

10:53.527 --> 10:57.073
That’s the first and last time
you ever call me that.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.825
I’m not interested in money.

10:59.909 --> 11:04.205
SH1FT3R chatter on the dark web
keeps talking about “gathering the keys.”

11:04.288 --> 11:07.583
Our cryptographers don't know
what that means yet,

11:07.667 --> 11:11.629
but we know SH1FT3R has
high-level contacts in the underworld.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.674
[Ms. Nowhere] The keys could be
nuclear codes--

11:14.757 --> 11:15.758
Piano keys.

11:15.841 --> 11:18.844
Wait, they’re trying to steal music?
Those maniacs!

11:19.261 --> 11:21.764
I thought they were
the best and brightest.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.516
I never said brightest.

11:23.599 --> 11:27.937
This is national security stuff
at the highest level. You ready for this?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.230
Born ready.

11:29.480 --> 11:34.944
Born a Toretto. Remember,
don’t just follow orders, follow your gut.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.363
You keep my family safe,

11:37.446 --> 11:40.658
or this SH1FT3R gang
will be the least of your worries.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.037
So if we’re gonna be racing,

11:45.121 --> 11:48.165
I guess the government
will pay for my fuel pump?

11:48.582 --> 11:50.751
You’re going to need more than that.

11:50.835 --> 11:51.794
[shouting] Gary!

11:52.336 --> 11:55.256
SH1FT3R races are like
nothing you’ve ever seen.

11:55.339 --> 11:58.217
They’re about pushing
technology to the edge.

11:58.384 --> 12:03.347
[Ms Nowehere] Smoke cannons, grappling
hooks, rocket engines, anything goes.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.390
-Respect.
-Dope.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.307
Awesome.

12:05.391 --> 12:09.478
Now there’s a tryout race coming
up in LA hosted by this woman.

12:09.562 --> 12:15.025
No way! Layla Gray?
She’s the most awesome racer around!

12:15.401 --> 12:17.445
Oh, except for you, T.

12:17.778 --> 12:22.616
Layla Gray is SH1FT3R’s main recruiter.
Win her race to infiltrate SH1FT3R.

12:22.700 --> 12:26.162
And you think she’s going to
let us into a tryout race?

12:26.620 --> 12:29.665
Hardly. SH1FT3R races
are tightly guarded secrets.

12:29.748 --> 12:32.835
Only a select few
know when and where they happen.

12:32.918 --> 12:36.547
But I pulled a list of local suppliers
and car customizers,

12:36.630 --> 12:39.467
then hacked their databases
for a client list.

12:39.550 --> 12:43.304
-At least one of these guys should race.
-We don’t need a list.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.723
[Tony]  We know someone who’ll be there.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.392
[Frostee]  If we can get Mitch’s phone,

12:48.476 --> 12:51.729
I can clone it and
we’ll get all the calls that he gets.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.690
[Tony] A bet’s a bet.
Let’s get it over with.

12:54.773 --> 12:58.944
[laughs] Well, look who it is!
Soapy Toretto!

12:59.028 --> 13:02.323
[laughs] Good one,
because "soapy" sounds like "Tony"!

13:02.698 --> 13:07.495
Uh no, because I called your car a soapbox
earlier, and you’re carrying soap suds.

13:07.578 --> 13:11.123
"Soapy" sounds nothing like "Tony."
What planet are you from?

13:11.707 --> 13:13.250
Can we get this over with?

13:13.334 --> 13:16.420
You can’t wash my car now.
I’m waiting for a call.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.298
-Wait while I wash.
- But I might have to leave.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.383
-Then I better start.
-Do it later!

13:21.467 --> 13:22.551
I don’t want to!

13:22.635 --> 13:24.303
Aw, man! My tacos!

13:24.386 --> 13:26.764
I’m so sorry-- Here, let me-- Frostee?

13:26.847 --> 13:27.681
Got it.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.308
Got a bit on your chin.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.185
-[Mitch] What--
-[Tony] Let--

13:31.268 --> 13:34.063
[Tony] I'm the buffest, remember!
Almost clean!

13:34.146 --> 13:36.023
[Mitch] What is wrong with you?

13:36.357 --> 13:38.651
Hey, let me get you some new tacos.

13:38.734 --> 13:39.568
You'd better.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.946
-[phone rings]
-I have to grab this.

13:42.029 --> 13:42.863
[gasps]

13:42.947 --> 13:44.198
[Mitch] Where is it?

13:44.281 --> 13:45.199
[mouthing]

13:45.282 --> 13:49.870
Oh, I think that’s, uh, the taco alarm so,
you know, we better get over-- Hey!

13:49.954 --> 13:50.788
Oops!

13:51.330 --> 13:52.873
What is your problem? Ugh!

13:52.957 --> 13:55.459
-I am so sorry, Mitch.
-[Mitch] Get off!

13:55.543 --> 13:59.713
-[Tony] Almost clean. Let me...
-[Mitch] Get your hands off. Quit it!

14:00.297 --> 14:01.257
-Got it?
-Yep.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.508
-Let's go.
-Tony.

14:02.883 --> 14:08.722
[shouting] Hey! You still owe me tacos!
Toretto! I want my tacos!

14:09.181 --> 14:12.768
[group laugh and cheer]

14:13.686 --> 14:16.313
Pretty slick, right?
What’s it say on there?

14:16.689 --> 14:20.109
Looks like the race will
be right here, downtown.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.944
Then that’s where we’ll race.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.446
-Let’s do this! Yeah!
-Whoo!

14:24.530 --> 14:26.532
No you’re not. This op is over.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.908
What? Why?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.326
The race is tonight.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.495
No problem, I’m ready!

14:31.579 --> 14:33.873
Look, according to this encrypted data,

14:33.956 --> 14:36.667
drivers need two forms of ID to enter:

14:36.750 --> 14:40.212
a retina scan and
a code that’s embedded in their cars.

14:40.296 --> 14:43.424
So? You must have some spy gear
that can get us in.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.635
I have the gear,
but you don’t have the expertise.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.972
I expected weeks to train you
while we chased leads.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.142
We found the race in two hours
and that’s a problem?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.602
So we’re too good.

14:54.685 --> 14:59.023
You’re mediocre at best. Anyway,
I can’t risk you going into this op.

14:59.106 --> 15:01.066
Layla Gray could have you killed.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.944
More importantly,
Dom could have me killed!

15:04.194 --> 15:08.365
We’re going Plan Bravo, everybody!
Launch the surveillance drones.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.702
Just put me in a car.
I know I can win that race!

15:11.785 --> 15:15.706
It takes 48 hours just to build a car
with the implanted codes.

15:15.789 --> 15:19.251
The whole plan was a long shot anyway.
Gary, get them out.

15:22.713 --> 15:26.342
-I can’t believe we're off the mission!
-[Tony] We'll do it.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.843
What did you say?

15:27.927 --> 15:31.722
I’m not following orders, I’m following
my gut. We can do this.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.351
I don’t know, T.
Getting past security will be tough.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.770
It would help if we had that spy stuff.

15:37.853 --> 15:41.440
I borrowed Ms. Nowhere’s purse.
It has all the cool gadgets.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.652
-You "borrowed" it?
-I was gonna give it back. Maybe.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.571
Okay, but where are we gonna get a car?

15:47.655 --> 15:50.157
We’ll "borrow" one. Wink.

15:51.116 --> 15:55.663
[Tony]  Frostee and I will bust in
and hack the retina scan computers.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.540
[Frostee] This isn't a good idea, T.
[whimpers]

15:58.624 --> 16:01.585
Don't worry.
Ziplines are the safest way to travel.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.505
What? No! No they are definitely not!

16:04.588 --> 16:06.840
So I think we just hit this button.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.342
[Frostee screams]

16:11.887 --> 16:12.721
[Tony exhales]

16:13.681 --> 16:14.932
[both scream]

16:15.015 --> 16:17.559
[Frostee yelling] How are you still alive?

16:20.437 --> 16:24.483
[Tony]  Cisco, use that mirror
to shut down the car and tow it away.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.443
-Okay. You ready?
-Yep.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.779
-Next light, we’re doing this.
-Okay.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.198
-Don't be scared.
-I’m not.

16:31.657 --> 16:35.327
All right, yeah, because, uh,
there’s no reason to be nervous.

16:35.411 --> 16:36.829
I know how this works.

16:36.912 --> 16:40.332
Shake the mirror twice,
then the red activation comes on.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.710
-Oh, there’s the light!
-Cisco, no!

16:42.793 --> 16:46.922
-[Echo sighs]
-[engine dies out]

16:48.674 --> 16:50.676
[Cisco] So, uh, that means, uh...

16:51.176 --> 16:54.388
It activates the EMP
and shuts down the engine.

16:54.471 --> 16:57.266
- [man] Move your truck, moron!
-[horns blare]

16:57.349 --> 16:59.143
At least we know it works.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.733
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Improvising.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.485
Hey, Mitch.

17:08.569 --> 17:12.322
Oh! Hey, Echo. W-What are you doing here?

17:12.406 --> 17:13.490
Chasing you.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.700
[laughs]

17:14.783 --> 17:17.286
Well, ya caught me. What can I do for you?

17:17.369 --> 17:18.412
Get out.

17:18.495 --> 17:20.539
-I'm sorry, what?
-Get. Out

17:20.622 --> 17:22.708
Uh, okay.

17:25.669 --> 17:27.212
-Hey!
-Thanks!

17:28.464 --> 17:31.008
-Will you call me?
-[Cisco] Hi, Mitch!

17:31.091 --> 17:34.678
[Mitch shouting] My tacos are in there!
My tacos!

17:38.390 --> 17:41.727
Once we knock that guy out,
you have ten minutes.

17:41.810 --> 17:42.644
Got it.

17:45.856 --> 17:48.358
Hey, what are you doing? Is that a purse?

17:48.442 --> 17:49.276
Night night.

17:49.359 --> 17:52.196
Aw, lug nuts, my eyes! Ah, dangit!

17:52.279 --> 17:53.113
[sighs]

17:54.031 --> 17:55.407
Hey! Are you okay?

17:55.491 --> 17:58.035
Sorry, man.
It’s our first time doing this.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.620
What? Who are you guys?

17:59.703 --> 18:01.246
[exclaims, sighs]

18:02.706 --> 18:04.792
We’re spy racers...

18:05.501 --> 18:07.628
[sniffs] Mmm! Sandalwood.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.007
[Gary] Drones are up.
We have eyes on our racer.

18:13.467 --> 18:18.347
Gary... Who’s driving that car?
And where’s my tactical purse?

18:18.430 --> 18:20.015
[shouting] Track my purse!

18:20.933 --> 18:23.936
[groaning]

18:24.436 --> 18:25.270
[groans]

18:25.354 --> 18:28.607
Okay, I’m fine. You good?
All good. You good?

18:28.690 --> 18:29.775
I’m working on it.

18:29.858 --> 18:33.153
Okay. I’m heading down.
Don’t let us get caught.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.905
[annoyed] I'm working on it.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.367
Hey, girl!

18:38.450 --> 18:40.536
Get out of there right now.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.578
Uh, I'd love to,

18:41.662 --> 18:45.124
but I’m too young
to drive, and my ride just left, so...

18:45.207 --> 18:46.333
This is no joke.

18:46.416 --> 18:48.877
-Yeah, I know.
-You're in serious danger.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.381
If Layla Gray catches you,
I can’t guarantee your safety.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.341
-I know.
-Not just your safety.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.135
There’s also my career.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.845
I just made it to Nowhere,

18:57.928 --> 19:01.223
[shouting] and I will not
get bumped back to Ms. Nothing.

19:01.306 --> 19:04.268
I was a Nothing for too long, Frostee!

19:05.018 --> 19:06.937
[takes deep breath]

19:07.604 --> 19:10.357
Plus SH1FT3R gets the nuclear keys
or whatever.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.193
Yeah, I got it! Can I work now? Bye.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.572
Dom is going to kill us.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.033
We gotta get out of here.
Are our clean identities ready?

19:20.117 --> 19:22.327
Jawohl, Fräulein Nirgends.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.913
Huh? Hm.

19:26.832 --> 19:27.666
[grunts]

19:29.042 --> 19:29.877
[gulps]

19:30.586 --> 19:31.545
[grunts]

19:32.045 --> 19:34.339
Whoa!

19:34.423 --> 19:35.257
[grunts]

19:35.549 --> 19:38.468
Yes! Sweet! Phew!

19:39.887 --> 19:41.180
Nice purse.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.723
-I know.
-[tires squeal]

19:52.149 --> 19:56.361
C’mon Mitch, this hose is about to
pop right out. When that happens...

19:56.445 --> 19:58.113
[imitates explosion]

19:58.197 --> 20:00.282
Nothing a little gum can’t fix.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.537
-Where are we on that scan, Frostee?
-Almost there.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.455
So are we.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.207
[Tony on phone]  Hack faster.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.210
Do your people treat you like this?
"Hack faster"?

20:11.293 --> 20:13.420
They have no idea what we do!

20:16.465 --> 20:18.717
Hey, I’m Mitch. This is my crew.

20:19.551 --> 20:23.889
[stammering] Yeah, just guys, you know...

20:23.972 --> 20:26.600
Have fun... Crew up.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.064
Maybe just keep quiet.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.858
Uh, right, no problem, gotcha.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.612
[Tony whimpers]

20:40.364 --> 20:41.198
[gasps]

20:43.700 --> 20:44.534
Uh-oh.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.662
[laughs nervously]

20:53.377 --> 20:55.003
Phew! Got it.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.090
High-five! Oh, sorry.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.342
[device chimes]

21:06.431 --> 21:10.560
My bag is packed, let’s burn
this place to the ground.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.146
Hold on a second,
they made it to the race.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.482
See, I told you they’d make it.

21:18.151 --> 21:19.027
[Cisco grunts]

21:19.444 --> 21:21.029
-Phew!
-Good luck, T.

21:21.113 --> 21:25.200
[stammering] Yeah, do something, uh,
drive, you go, man!

21:25.867 --> 21:27.744
Uh, I’m sorry, I'll sit down.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.500
[electro music plays]

21:37.296 --> 21:38.380
[distant cheering]

21:38.463 --> 21:40.007
-Whoa!
-[crowd cheers]

21:42.342 --> 21:44.761
Y’all ready for some racing?

21:45.220 --> 21:46.763
[crowd roars]

21:48.140 --> 21:49.224
[Frostee laughs]

21:49.308 --> 21:52.894
[excitedly] Whoo! It's Layla Gray!
She’s really here!

21:52.978 --> 21:56.440
Ms. Nowhere said she'd be here,
but she’s really here!

21:56.523 --> 21:59.443
Think you got what it takes
to roll with SH1FT3R?

21:59.526 --> 22:01.528
[crowd roars]

22:01.611 --> 22:03.488
[engines rev]

22:03.572 --> 22:05.365
[Layla Gray]  Time to find out.

22:10.203 --> 22:13.165
[Layla Gray]  Only one can make it.
The rest of you?

22:13.248 --> 22:15.584
Well I hope you’re insured.

22:15.667 --> 22:19.838
I know most of y’all have been street
racing and doing all sorts of things

22:19.921 --> 22:24.134
to make it into this crew.
But one of you is a bit of a mystery man.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.263
So, as a special treat,
I’m gonna hop into our race today

22:28.347 --> 22:30.849
and find out what he’s all about.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.560
[engine revs]

22:37.939 --> 22:39.274
Hello, "Mitch."

23:07.469 --> 23:08.303
IN MEMORY OF SEAN COLLINS
