WEBVTT

00:04.705 --> 00:08.109
("Electric" by Bass Drum
of Death playing)

00:11.612 --> 00:13.747
* When I destroy

00:13.781 --> 00:16.117
* It's my own town electric...

00:16.150 --> 00:17.718
Are you living?

00:17.751 --> 00:18.552
Yes.

00:18.586 --> 00:22.390
Have you ever dated
Taylor Swift?

00:22.423 --> 00:25.726
Uh, yes. Though that doesn't
narrow it down very much.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.761
(laughs)
Okay...

00:27.795 --> 00:29.730
Come on. Help me
out here, Madani.

00:29.763 --> 00:30.831
He's Jake Gyllenhaal, sir.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.533
Hey, he meant help
with a question.

00:32.566 --> 00:33.567
You hate fun, huh?

00:33.601 --> 00:36.204
And we just hit
checkpoint seven.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.239
That's two minutes to the LZ.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.074
Jimbo, let the customers know.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.742
* I want you to die...

00:41.775 --> 00:43.077
Two minutes.

00:43.111 --> 00:43.811
Touchdown in two, gentlemen.

00:45.479 --> 00:46.647
MAN (over radio): Darkhorse...
Two minutes.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.216
Command's barking in my ear.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.583
(music stops)

00:49.617 --> 00:51.152
You have the controls.
MADANI: I have the controls.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.486
GALLO:
Anchor Two, this is Darkhorse.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.688
We are two minutes out
from the LZ.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.624
Everything looks clear.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.692
MAN (over radio):
Copy that. Out.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.494
RICHARD: Hey, pilot. You're
the first Special Ops chick

01:00.528 --> 01:02.196
I ever met, so I got to ask.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.298
How do you control yourself
around so many hot, sweaty men?

01:04.332 --> 01:05.599
(soft laughter)

01:05.633 --> 01:07.235
Only hard part's the smell, sir.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.303
(soft laughter)

01:12.140 --> 01:13.207
Visual on the LZ.
I have the control.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.309
MADANI:
You have the controls.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.188
RICHARD:
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:32.860 --> 01:35.229
(helicopter whirring)

01:35.263 --> 01:36.830
RICHARD (over radio):
Okay, gentlemen. Let's move.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.134
They've gone silent.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.136
They went internal comms.
Shut us out.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.137
Yeah, they can do
what they want.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.472
(explosion, gunfire in distance)

01:44.505 --> 01:47.275
We're just the taxi drivers.
Right, Jimmy?

01:47.308 --> 01:49.577
That's what Jess tells the kid
when he asks what I do.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.179
He just had a birthday, right?

01:51.212 --> 01:53.581
Yep, seven years old.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.150
Big fan of 20 Questions,
by the way.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.186
I'll tell him
to steer clear of you.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.788
They have the package.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.192
(vehicle approaching)

02:04.225 --> 02:06.560
Technical, 11 o'clock!

02:07.928 --> 02:08.696
JIMMY:
I don't have a shot!

02:08.729 --> 02:10.231
RICHARD:
Keep moving, keep moving!

02:10.264 --> 02:11.632
Man down!

02:11.665 --> 02:13.201
You fly. I'm on radio.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.802
GALLO: This is Darkhorse,
we're in a TIC.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.771
One technical, six tangos,
wounded CAG.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.473
RICHARD:
Go!

02:19.507 --> 02:20.874
(gunfire continues)

02:20.908 --> 02:22.543
RICHARD:
Go, go, go, go!

02:22.576 --> 02:23.544
Up with four and one!

02:23.577 --> 02:24.912
GALLO:
Up with four and one.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.485
(yells)

02:32.586 --> 02:33.787
(screams)

02:33.821 --> 02:34.888
Madani's been hit!

02:34.922 --> 02:35.823
I have the controls.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.858
(Madani panting)

02:37.891 --> 02:39.560
JIMMY:
We got an RPG.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.729
RPG at four o'clock!

02:41.762 --> 02:42.863
What?
Everyone brace!

02:44.932 --> 02:46.867
(inhales sharply)

02:48.436 --> 02:49.870
(grunts)

02:49.903 --> 02:52.240
(soldiers shouting in distance)

02:52.273 --> 02:53.507
(exhales)

03:17.298 --> 03:18.866
MADANI:
Hey, Lieutenant Porter.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.234
You're up early.

03:20.268 --> 03:22.770
Yeah, I've got
a briefing at 0630.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.273
Got to swing by my place first.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.908
My other boyfriend
always stays for breakfast.

03:27.941 --> 03:30.778
Well, my other girlfriend
always makes me breakfast, so...

03:30.811 --> 03:31.845
Oh, is that right?

03:31.879 --> 03:34.282
Oh, that's right, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

03:34.315 --> 03:35.949
Mm-hmm.
(chuckles)

03:37.951 --> 03:39.553
(hisses)

03:39.587 --> 03:41.789
Sorry.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.726
First day back, huh?

03:45.759 --> 03:47.361
You okay?

03:47.395 --> 03:49.463
I'm good.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.031
You know, you and Gallo,
you did everything you could.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.901
You followed procedure,
you tried to find the others.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.603
Babe.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.870
I said I'm good.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.472
Okay?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.349
I will see you at formation.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.352
Huh?

04:13.887 --> 04:16.990
(door opens, closes)

04:17.024 --> 04:18.826
ANNA (moaning):
Yes. Say it.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.894
GALLO: Hooah!
Say it again!

04:20.928 --> 04:22.363
Hooah!

04:23.864 --> 04:25.866
(panting)

04:28.035 --> 04:29.370
GALLO:
Oh, dang.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.605
I got PT in 15.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.307
Hey, uncuff me.

04:33.341 --> 04:34.342
Come on.
Uh-uh.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.976
Come on. Seriously.

04:36.009 --> 04:36.977
(both laugh)

04:37.010 --> 04:38.446
Got to go.
All right!

04:38.479 --> 04:40.981
You've been drinking
all night, cowboy.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.983
Anyone can run
eight miles sober.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.985
Real test is doing it drunk.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.388
(grunts)

04:47.421 --> 04:49.390
(sniffles)
(grunts)

04:49.423 --> 04:50.691
* Better...

04:50.724 --> 04:52.360
Can you, uh, lock the
door when you go?

04:52.393 --> 04:53.827
(clicks tongue)
Hooah.

04:53.861 --> 04:54.995
Oh...

04:55.028 --> 04:57.030
* Do a little better.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.534
MAX:
* Hello, my baby

05:00.568 --> 05:03.003
* Hello, my honey,
hello, my ragtime girl *

05:03.036 --> 05:04.938
* Send me a kiss by wire

05:04.972 --> 05:07.375
* Baby, my heart's on fire.
A little loud.

05:07.408 --> 05:11.612
Maybe you could try singing
something else today, huh?

05:11.645 --> 05:14.415
Or you could sing it with me
like Dad does.

05:16.584 --> 05:19.887
Let's go.
When does Dad get back
from his trip?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.889
Soon, sweetie. Soon.

05:23.957 --> 05:24.858
MAN:
One, two, three...
PLATOON: One!

05:24.892 --> 05:27.027
One, two, three...
Two!

05:27.060 --> 05:28.729
One, two, three...
Three!

05:28.762 --> 05:30.864
One, two, three...
Four!

05:30.898 --> 05:32.900
Platoon, halt.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.904
Carry on.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.038
MAN:
Platoon, exercise.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.740
One, two, three...
One!

05:39.773 --> 05:41.775
One, two, three...
Two!

05:48.048 --> 05:49.450
Morning, Corporal.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.086
(beeping)

05:53.120 --> 05:54.722
(lock buzzes)

05:54.755 --> 05:56.390
(exhales)

06:08.602 --> 06:11.171
Last time I saw you,
we both looked a lot worse.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.006
That...
COMMAND SERGEANT MAJOR:
Shadow Raiders!

06:13.040 --> 06:15.909
Attention!

06:17.445 --> 06:19.880
Shadow Raiders
company formed, sir.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.050
Today we welcome back to duty

06:23.083 --> 06:24.485
Captain Leland Gallo

06:24.518 --> 06:27.988
and Warrant Officer Nora Madani.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.493
I have the honor
of presenting you both

06:32.526 --> 06:33.927
with the Distinguished
Flying Cross

06:33.961 --> 06:35.963
for valor and perseverance

06:35.996 --> 06:38.031
in the face of extreme odds.
Congratulations,
Captain Gallo, great job.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.801
Of course, sir.
HASKINS: After your aircraft
was damaged by enemy fire,

06:40.834 --> 06:42.970
you safely evac'd your team

06:43.003 --> 06:45.038
before performing
a high-risk ditch maneuver.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.707
Congratulations there, Nora.
When you were then unable

06:46.740 --> 06:48.141
to contact the others,

06:48.175 --> 06:49.943
you deployed your wilderness
survival training

06:49.977 --> 06:51.545
until rescue was possible.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.480
How's that leg doing?

06:52.513 --> 06:53.981
Good, sir. Thank you.
Well done, soldiers.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.115
Your actions are not only

06:55.148 --> 06:56.817
a testament to this unit,

06:56.850 --> 06:59.152
but the entire
Special Ops community.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.688
SHADOW RAIDERS:
Hooah!

07:04.592 --> 07:05.993
Now, let's take
a moment to honor those

07:06.026 --> 07:07.928
who remain unaccounted for.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.964
Sergeants Hendrix,
Balewa and Dallas

07:10.998 --> 07:13.867
of the Delta Force
Combat Applications Group,

07:13.901 --> 07:15.135
OGA Operator Richard

07:15.168 --> 07:18.606
and our very own
Sergeant Jimmy Kam.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.174
Our thoughts and prayers
are with them.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.677
Sergeant Major,

07:23.711 --> 07:24.712
dismiss the company.

07:28.248 --> 07:31.184
COMMAND SERGEANT MAJOR:
Shadow Raiders, dismissed!

07:31.218 --> 07:33.887
SHADOW RAIDERS:
Hooah!

07:33.921 --> 07:36.023
(indistinct chatter)

07:36.056 --> 07:38.592
(quietly): Send those
two to my office.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.560
Sir, I've been trying
to reach you.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.061
It's better you didn't.

07:41.094 --> 07:41.995
As long as nothing's changed.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.564
No, nothing's changed.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.165
We got other things
to think about, all right?

07:45.198 --> 07:47.200
They're, uh, plugging us into
a training exercise this week.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.770
N.O.E. course, below tree line.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.038
(clicks tongue)
Get stoked.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.040
Sir.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.676
That decision we made
was a mistake.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.178
Ever since, it's all
I can think about.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.881
Captain Gallo, Chief Madani,

08:00.914 --> 08:03.016
the colonel would like
to see you in his office.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.052
Oh, and you're not
in Somalia anymore.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.687
Better shave
that beard soon.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.660
Great.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.194
(knocking on door)

08:18.098 --> 08:19.667
Captain Gallo.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.168
Ms. Madani,
reporting as requested.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.302
At ease.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.237
All right, look.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.273
I'll get right to it. Madani,

08:26.306 --> 08:28.108
you're being placed
on administrative duty.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.644
Gallo, you'll fly with someone
else for the time being.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.312
I don't understand.
You just gave me a medal.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.914
I know.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.315
But you've been through a lot.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.217
A downed bird, then six days
stuck in those mountains?

08:37.250 --> 08:39.853
I think a break
from flying is warranted.

08:39.887 --> 08:42.022
We both went through all that.

08:42.055 --> 08:43.223
Captain Gallo has
much more experience

08:43.256 --> 08:44.658
with combat stress.

08:44.692 --> 08:45.926
With all due respect,

08:45.959 --> 08:47.595
she's squared away, sir.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.963
Did I not pass my psych eval?

08:49.997 --> 08:51.665
You passed, yes.
But there were concerns.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.267
Anxiety about getting back in
the cockpit, and your injury.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.336
Now, I understand you're
still in some pain.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.271
I'm fine.
My decision's made.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.040
Sir, if you would just please...
Madani.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.709
There are a lot of officers
in command who think

09:01.742 --> 09:03.977
we shouldn't have opened
combat positions to women.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.047
Let's not give them
any fodder, all right?

09:08.081 --> 09:09.049
Yes, sir.

09:13.954 --> 09:14.955
GALLO: Hey, three months
is nothing, all right?

09:14.988 --> 09:18.058
I've had leftovers I've
kept longer than that.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.660
Hey, what's going on?

09:19.693 --> 09:22.162
I'm grounded. Three months.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.864
Are you okay?
Do you know

09:23.897 --> 09:26.199
how many times you've asked me
that since I got back?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.101
(whistles)

09:30.638 --> 09:32.906
Hey, where are you going?

09:32.940 --> 09:36.076
If I'm not flying today, there's
something else I have to do.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.086
(dog barking in distance)

09:46.119 --> 09:48.121
(birds chirping)

09:50.023 --> 09:51.659
(knocking on door)

09:51.692 --> 09:52.860
Come in, it's open.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.663
Oh, Jess.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.397
I would've come earlier,

09:57.430 --> 09:59.066
but I rehabbed in Germany.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.034
I just got back Saturday.
It's okay.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.370
Sit.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.941
I've been watching
Max's cartoons.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.344
Anything to distract me.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.983
Jess, is there
anything I can do?

10:16.016 --> 10:19.052
I need answers.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.388
I mean, they won't even tell me
what country it happened in.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.923
(quietly):
Mission is classified.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.692
It's always classified.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.259
Do you have any idea

10:26.293 --> 10:28.095
what it's like
being married to somebody

10:28.128 --> 10:30.230
who can't tell you
where they are going

10:30.263 --> 10:31.999
or when they are coming back?

10:32.032 --> 10:34.367
Jess. I'm so sorry.
It's not fair.

10:34.401 --> 10:37.070
You and Gallo don't
even have families.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.972
Why are you the ones
that get to c...?

10:40.373 --> 10:42.075
Oh.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.047
I don't mean that.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.050
No, you're right.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.719
It's not fair.

10:56.423 --> 11:00.060
* Will you be

11:00.093 --> 11:02.395
* My cool companion?

11:02.429 --> 11:06.266
* And I...

11:06.299 --> 11:07.167
GALLO: You realize
this is fraternizing,

11:07.200 --> 11:08.702
you coming here alone.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.740
We need to talk, sir.

11:12.773 --> 11:15.075
* Will you be...

11:15.108 --> 11:17.477
All right.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.979
* My cool companion?

11:19.012 --> 11:22.115
You want something?
No.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.985
I, uh, went back to the colonel
about your desk duty situation.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.821
He wasn't having it. Should
have Porter give it a try.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.489
Colonel loves
his Eagle Scout ass.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.058
I'm not here about desk duty.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.993
I thought you said
nothing's changed.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.461
We got medals today.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.797
You don't feel any
guilt about that?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.832
Yeah. Yeah, I feel guilt.

11:38.866 --> 11:42.302
But allow me to quote
the great Justin Bieber.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.772
"Too late now
to say I'm sorry."

11:44.805 --> 11:47.140
I don't understand how you're
so fine about everything.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.441
We lied in our debriefs.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.077
We made that decision together.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.311
And if we get caught?

11:51.344 --> 11:52.445
Look, it's paranoia talking.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.114
Mission review is closed.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.049
We're good, as long
as our stories matched.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.151
I said everything
we agreed on.

11:58.185 --> 11:58.852
All right.

11:58.886 --> 11:59.686
Richard bailed with the prisoner

11:59.719 --> 12:01.154
and that's the last
we saw of them.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.122
Great. There's no problem then.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.223
There is for me.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.894
I want to come clean.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.162
You're out of your mind.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.164
There's something bigger
going on here.
We've been over this.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.066
Richard lied
about the prisoner. Why?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.102
Telling the truth
won't help find Jimmy.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.771
It's not gonna help anyone,
least of all you.

12:17.805 --> 12:21.341
I joined the Army to be
one of the good guys.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.776
That is not how this feels.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.544
Well, people don't want
boots on the ground,

12:24.577 --> 12:26.413
so this is what war is now.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.182
Covert ops, blurred lines.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.083
That's what you joined.

12:30.117 --> 12:33.153
Nice speech.

12:35.022 --> 12:38.058
Yeah, been giving that
to myself a lot lately

12:38.091 --> 12:41.194
because we don't
have a choice.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.530
We need to keep
our mouths shut.

12:47.234 --> 12:50.303
(whispering):
You're right.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.505
(telephone rings)

12:52.539 --> 12:54.041
JESS: Sweetie,
can you get that?

12:56.009 --> 12:58.011
Hello?

12:58.045 --> 13:00.147
Daddy?

13:00.180 --> 13:01.181
When are you coming home?

13:01.214 --> 13:03.884
I-I miss you.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.498
(grunts)

13:21.368 --> 13:23.570
(shouts)

13:26.306 --> 13:27.340
(panting)

13:29.042 --> 13:29.977
(groans)
Okay.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.311
All right.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.546
Okay. Come on, come on.

13:33.580 --> 13:34.514
Get up. Get up.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.550
What happened up there?

13:40.053 --> 13:42.222
They shoved a sat phone
in my hand,

13:42.255 --> 13:44.357
told me to dial my wife.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.228
Said they'd shoot me
if I didn't.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.897
So you called their bluff.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.900
I wanted to hear her voice.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.243
Lieutenant Porter here is
one of our best intel officers.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.377
He'll be your
primary liaison.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.014
Ma'am.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.216
Anyone ever tell you you
look like an action figure?

14:09.249 --> 14:10.317
No, ma'am.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.385
You're adorable.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.223
Follow me.

14:17.557 --> 14:18.926
Last night,
Jimmy Kam called home

14:18.959 --> 14:20.060
on a scrambled sat phone.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.194
He's been captured,

14:21.228 --> 14:24.364
along with one of the CAG
operators, Sergeant Hendrix.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.066
This is Thea from OGA.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.400
It's "Thay-a."

14:29.102 --> 14:31.404
Her team will be embedding
with us for a while.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.907
These are the first POWs
since Bergdahl.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.242
That is not a good thing,

14:35.275 --> 14:37.244
in case any of you are fuzzy
on the situation.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.279
Everyone from POTUS on down

14:39.312 --> 14:41.548
has been briefed and our orders
here are to keep this quiet.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.251
All right, play the video.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.585
DEBRIEFER:
All right, Mrs. Kam,

14:45.618 --> 14:47.921
I need you to tell me
what happened last night.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.389
JESS:
My son answered the phone.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.925
Jimmy asked him to put me on.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.460
He explained what happened.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.362
There were four of them

14:55.395 --> 14:56.930
that bailed out
of the Black Hawk together,

14:56.964 --> 14:59.933
him and three Delta Force guys.

14:59.967 --> 15:03.370
They got surrounded.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.072
Two got killed.

15:05.105 --> 15:08.375
Jimmy and Sergeant Hendrix

15:08.408 --> 15:11.644
ran out of ammunition
and they got captured.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.313
DEBRIEFER: Did your husband
mention a man named Richard

15:13.346 --> 15:16.049
or the prisoner
they had in custody?

15:16.083 --> 15:17.284
JESS:
He said that they were still

15:17.317 --> 15:19.086
in the Black Hawk
when he bailed.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.321
DEBRIEFER:
What else did Jimmy tell you?

15:21.354 --> 15:22.555
JESS:
There are demands.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.624
50 ISIS prisoners

15:24.657 --> 15:27.294
in exchange for the two of them.

15:27.327 --> 15:31.098
And then the line went dead.

15:31.131 --> 15:34.001
THEA: We believe that
they're in the Golis Mountains

15:34.034 --> 15:35.602
being held by one of the
warlords that control that area.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.471
Our best guess is this man.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.008
Khalid Samatar.
Your best guess.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.375
That's-that's all you got?

15:44.644 --> 15:45.545
It's Captain Gallo, right?

15:45.578 --> 15:48.348
And Ms. Madani.
The ones who made it back.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.017
We did what we were
trained to do.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.151
Oh, I know.
I read your debriefs.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.086
And I wouldn't be here
if you hadn't crashed your helo.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.521
Now, we expect that

15:54.554 --> 15:56.423
when Samatar's people
make contact again,

15:56.456 --> 15:57.624
it'll be
through an intermediary.

15:57.657 --> 16:01.128
This first volley was more
about theatrics than anything.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.762
As for Richard and the prisoner,

16:02.795 --> 16:06.133
Mrs. Kam's account corroborates
the one that we already have.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.767
They evac'd the Black Hawk
after the others

16:07.800 --> 16:09.702
and continue to be MIA.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.705
HASKINS:
But our focus is on the ones

16:12.739 --> 16:15.108
we know are alive.
Now, we've been informed

16:15.142 --> 16:16.643
that a prisoner exchange
is off the table.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.145
So, that means

16:18.178 --> 16:20.713
the only way they get out
is we break them out.

16:20.747 --> 16:23.050
Yeah.
Good.
Now, we are assembling a team

16:23.083 --> 16:24.784
to plan and execute
a rescue mission.

16:24.817 --> 16:28.055
OGA on logistics, CAGs
doing the door-kicking

16:28.088 --> 16:30.123
and us providing transpo.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.125
Gallo, Suarez, Sood and Nilsson,
you'll be flying.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.127
Porter, DeWaal and Branch,
TacOps.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.629
Green and Madani,
you'll handle flight planning.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.099
THEA: We have to find them
first, but make no mistake,

16:39.132 --> 16:39.932
we will bring them home.

16:39.966 --> 16:42.102
Until then,
you are stuck with us.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.542
Sir, you have to let me
fly this mission.

16:49.576 --> 16:50.643
You're grounded, Madani.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.145
I know those mountains.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.181
I studied them like crazy
before we went in.

16:54.214 --> 16:54.881
Not only that,
Captain Gallo and I

16:54.914 --> 16:56.716
have been paired up for a year.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.219
Look, I already got
this OGA kid up my ass.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.053
I don't need you in there, too.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.089
The psychologist said
I'm fine to fly.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.690
I don't understand why
you won't accept that.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.392
Because Lieutenant Porter
asked me not to.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.729
Why would he do that?

17:09.762 --> 17:10.830
He knows you better
than anyone.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.032
He doesn't think
you're squared away.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.205
Sir, we all know how
you got your Silver Star.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.440
Firefight in Fallujah.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.242
You went back
for an injured soldier

17:22.275 --> 17:23.543
who was left behind.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.145
All I'm asking is that
you let me do the same.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.452
You will have to prove
you're up to it.

17:32.485 --> 17:34.121
However you want.

17:34.154 --> 17:37.190
You will fly the
Nap-of-the-Earth exercise

17:37.224 --> 17:40.127
on Thursday, but you will
do it as pilot-in-command.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.163
Captain Gallo won't touch
the controls unless you choke.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.098
Now, you've never
done below tree line

17:45.132 --> 17:46.099
on your own, have you?

17:46.133 --> 17:48.201
No, sir.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.470
Then I suggest
you start practicing.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.505
Thank you, sir.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.777
Nora. I can explain, Nora.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.279
You went behind my back.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.713
No, I tried to talk to
you and you wouldn't.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.848
Because I'm fine.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.283
Do you think I don't notice
you taking those pills?

18:03.316 --> 18:05.252
The doctor said as needed

18:05.285 --> 18:07.220
and I would never take them
when I'm flying.
Nora, I...

18:07.254 --> 18:09.122
You know, when I
joined this unit,

18:09.156 --> 18:10.723
I knew I would have
to work twice as hard

18:10.757 --> 18:13.560
to prove myself to them,
and I'm fine with that,

18:13.593 --> 18:15.762
but to you, too?

18:15.795 --> 18:18.465
That's messed up.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.103
(winces)

18:37.517 --> 18:40.187
GALLO: I don't know how you
changed the colonel's mind,

18:40.220 --> 18:42.322
but I'm impressed.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.756
You ready
for your practice run?

18:43.790 --> 18:46.226
Yes, sir.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.763
We're taking Adele?
Yup.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.232
(Gallo laughs)

18:53.800 --> 18:56.203
Let's do it.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.677
Hey, whoa.
Hold up, hold up.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.313
Before they can hear us,

19:06.346 --> 19:09.282
it isn't normal for OGA
to sweep in like this.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.217
There is something
bigger going on here.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.785
Now, if we're gonna
get Jimmy out safe,

19:12.819 --> 19:13.820
we need to know what.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.956
So, you agree with me now?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.526
First step is to ID the prisoner
we had that night.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.960
Yeah. I got a friend
who could help.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.295
I'm on it.

19:24.364 --> 19:27.367
Renegade One-Two.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.336
Adele is ready to roll
in the deep.

19:29.369 --> 19:29.969
DISPATCHER:
Renegade One-Two,

19:30.002 --> 19:31.304
hangar 02.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.872
Roger. Clear for takeoff.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.876
You nervous?

19:39.379 --> 19:41.180
No, sir.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.386
("Ran" by Future Islands
playing)

19:46.419 --> 19:47.887
* Ingest

19:49.389 --> 19:52.259
* Where it goes

19:52.292 --> 19:56.363
* Nobody sees but me

19:56.396 --> 19:58.765
* So perfect and so sweet

19:58.798 --> 20:01.234
* But the rest

20:01.268 --> 20:05.004
* Feels incomplete

20:05.037 --> 20:10.310
* Oh, like the rabbit's foot
I keep *

20:10.343 --> 20:12.312
* In the locket with no key...

20:12.345 --> 20:14.314
I couldn't get us clearance
for the actual course today,

20:14.347 --> 20:15.748
but this will do
for practice.

20:15.782 --> 20:18.851
How did you get permission
for residential?

20:18.885 --> 20:20.687
It's empty.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.323
Developer went belly-up,
never finished it.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.024
All right, bring her
down below the roofs,

20:25.057 --> 20:26.326
then shoot down the line.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.928
120 knots.

20:28.961 --> 20:32.332
* How it sings as it goes

20:32.365 --> 20:36.336
* Flight of field,
driving snow... *

20:39.806 --> 20:40.973
Right turn.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.313
You're drifting.
Watch out.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.881
(screams)

20:48.915 --> 20:50.283
Trees, Madani.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.319
Everyone, brace!

20:52.352 --> 20:54.053
You need to pull up...

20:54.086 --> 20:55.322
now!

20:58.858 --> 21:00.327
(panting)

21:00.360 --> 21:01.794
You almost killed us both.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.634
I know.

21:17.710 --> 21:18.645
Everyone brace!

21:21.648 --> 21:23.416
We lost engine two!

21:23.450 --> 21:26.753
JIMMY:
Confirmed. Fire on engine two!

21:26.786 --> 21:27.854
GALLO:
She's shaking like crazy.

21:27.887 --> 21:28.888
We're gonna have
to bring her down.
MADANI: We need

21:28.921 --> 21:31.458
to get as far away
from the tangos as possible.

21:31.491 --> 21:32.459
GALLO: No. We're not
making it much farther.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.093
Find me someplace safe.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.529
All I see is rocks down there.

21:36.563 --> 21:40.800
There's a lake.
West-southwest, two klicks.

21:40.833 --> 21:41.501
We need to evac the others
before we ditch.

21:41.534 --> 21:44.103
It's too dangerous otherwise.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.639
Listen up! We're gonna bring her
to a hover over the water.

21:46.673 --> 21:49.642
You all bail, then we'll get
as far from you as we can.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.411
30 seconds out.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.712
He'll drown with
that hood on.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.547
It's not coming off.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.658
JIMMY: Go, go, go, now!
Out soldier, now!

22:08.761 --> 22:11.464
Go, go, go, go!

22:11.498 --> 22:15.368
I can't hold the hover.
We're moving.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.506
(hyperventilating)

22:19.539 --> 22:20.440
I'm losing controls.

22:22.709 --> 22:23.510
We're going down.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.381
Hey! Hey!

22:28.415 --> 22:30.417
(muffled):
Help me.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.088
This is it!

22:41.728 --> 22:43.830
Mm...
(sniffs)

22:43.863 --> 22:46.065
Morning.

22:46.098 --> 22:47.567
Sorry I'm late.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.503
Slept like crap.
Yeah, I bet.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.038
All that guilt over nearly
killing us yesterday.

22:54.474 --> 22:55.708
I'm gonna hit the
simulator hard

22:55.742 --> 22:57.744
between now and
the flight test.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.412
I'll be ready.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.420
Here is the first batch.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.556
This is... Anna.
Nora.

23:09.589 --> 23:12.425
She's getting us the personnel
records for the 802.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.527
Hope you find what you're
looking for, cowboy.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.563
(Anna chuckles)

23:17.797 --> 23:20.533
So how, exactly,
do you know her?

23:20.567 --> 23:22.435
We go out now and then.

23:22.469 --> 23:24.771
She's into some kinky stuff.
Loves handcuffs.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.739
Yeah, I did not need
to know that.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.078
This is definitely
the tattoo I saw.

23:34.113 --> 23:37.216
They told us we were targeting
a Somali national that night.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.751
Yeah. Instead we get
an American soldier.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.219
Let's find his face.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.454
Yeah.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.805
(phone vibrating)

24:00.840 --> 24:01.808
It's Jess.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.810
Go. I'll keep looking.

24:03.843 --> 24:06.445
If I get bored, I'll just take
a handcuff break.

24:16.756 --> 24:19.492
(soldiers sounding off,
counting off calisthenics)

24:35.775 --> 24:38.845
I need to ask
you something.
Yeah?

24:38.878 --> 24:40.547
What's OGA?

24:40.580 --> 24:42.615
"Other government agency."

24:42.649 --> 24:45.284
It's a euphemism we use
for the CIA.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.655
They made me sign something
that said I can't tell anybody

24:48.688 --> 24:52.559
about Jimmy being captured...
not even my son.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.561
Right now, Jimmy's a lot more
valuable alive.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.563
If this leaks, the situation
gets less stable.

24:56.596 --> 24:58.865
This is insane.

24:58.898 --> 25:02.168
I can't talk to anyone,
I can't know anything.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.571
I'm just supposed to
sit here and wait?

25:06.706 --> 25:08.307
I don't understand how
you live like that.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.909
It's how Jimmy lives, too.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.679
And I've never been
able to understand it.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.548
I am going to get myself
on the team that goes in,

25:15.582 --> 25:17.316
and we will get him back.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.687
But you need to promise me
something, too.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.855
You won't give up.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.993
(loud boom)

25:27.026 --> 25:28.761
DRILL INSTRUCTOR:
Present arms!

25:28.795 --> 25:31.564
(bugle blowing
retreat ceremony call)

25:44.677 --> 25:46.579
(sighs heavily)

25:52.752 --> 25:54.587
Son of a bitch.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.897
Excuse me, ma'am,
you asked to see me?

26:07.800 --> 26:09.636
Yes, I did.
Thanks for coming.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.905
I understand you
and Ms. Madani are a couple.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.908
That's right.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.077
We met in the 101st.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.946
When I put in a packet for
Special Ops, she did, too.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.715
It's, it's when they started
taking female pilots.

26:22.749 --> 26:25.251
And, tell me, what are your
thoughts on Captain Gallo?

26:25.284 --> 26:27.086
I'm not sure what you mean.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.621
They went through
a lot together.

26:28.655 --> 26:29.656
That can create
intense feelings.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.625
He's her commanding officer.

26:32.659 --> 26:35.628
The rules around that
are very clear.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.396
One last thing.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.666
Monday evening, she
left base alone,

26:39.699 --> 26:40.667
stayed out several hours.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.001
You're checking our exit logs?

26:42.034 --> 26:42.802
We're running a
deep-black operation.

26:42.835 --> 26:44.103
I'm just doing
my due diligence.

26:45.872 --> 26:48.675
Any idea where she went?

26:48.708 --> 26:50.843
I believe she went
to a movie, ma'am.

26:50.877 --> 26:53.846
I could ask her which one.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.082
Thank you, Lieutenant.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.684
No need.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.799
Hey rotor-head. You awake?

27:12.832 --> 27:17.136
I need you to think.
What'd you hear upstairs?

27:17.169 --> 27:19.672
Men's voices.
How many?

27:19.706 --> 27:20.773
Four or five.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.108
Okay. Anything else?

27:22.141 --> 27:25.678
A call to prayer
fr-from the outside.

27:25.712 --> 27:27.279
We're near a village.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.815
Okay. That's good.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.783
What direction did
the sound come from?

27:30.817 --> 27:32.985
From the right, maybe...

27:33.019 --> 27:34.787
ten feet from the top
of the stairs.

27:34.821 --> 27:37.023
There was a breeze
from that direction, too.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.826
That's an exit.

27:43.863 --> 27:47.466
We should do it here,
before they move us again.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.335
We're gonna get our
hands free, okay,

27:49.368 --> 27:52.171
we'll have surprise
on our side.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.741
We're gonna overpower them,
we're gonna take their weapons.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.843
No, no. No, no!
And we are gonna fight
our way out.

27:56.876 --> 27:59.812
No way that'll work.
We'll get ourselves killed.

27:59.846 --> 28:01.848
You want to wait here until
they cut our heads off?

28:01.881 --> 28:03.082
I don't know.

28:03.115 --> 28:07.019
We have a shot...
and we got to take it.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.232
Okay, this empty neighborhood
was creepy enough

28:20.266 --> 28:23.870
when we were flying through it,
but this is next level.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.739
Hey, it's secure.
We can't be too careful.

28:26.773 --> 28:29.809
It reminds me of a war...
A war zone, yeah, I know.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.179
So, what'd you find?

28:33.212 --> 28:35.748
(clears throat)
All right.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.083
802nd Infantry,
4th Brigade.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.218
His name is Davis Goundry.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.921
He's listed as killed
in action in 2014.

28:41.954 --> 28:44.857
That's impossible.
Yeah, I know.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.893
We saw him alive a month ago.
We stumbled onto
something here.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.527
No idea what it means.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.930
We need to take it
to the colonel.
And say what?

28:50.963 --> 28:52.865
"Hey, we saw a dead
guy in Somalia"?

28:52.899 --> 28:56.202
"Oh, and by the way,
we lied in our debriefs"?

28:56.235 --> 28:58.237
We can't do anything
until we have a lot more.

29:00.106 --> 29:01.874
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

29:04.977 --> 29:08.214
I've told so many lies,
I've lost count.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.918
My flying's gone to hell, too.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.786
I thought I was
stronger than this.

29:13.820 --> 29:14.921
You know what your problem is?

29:14.954 --> 29:16.989
I can't wait for you to tell me.

29:17.023 --> 29:18.324
You're too hard on yourself.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.127
Duty is not the opposite
of weakness.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.795
It's the cure for weakness.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.330
That's bleak.

29:24.363 --> 29:27.333
I like structure,
okay? Rules.

29:27.366 --> 29:29.268
There was a time
when I didn't have it.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.270
I told a lot of lies.

29:31.303 --> 29:34.273
I hurt a lot of people.
It was bad.

29:34.306 --> 29:38.110
Mm. You know... you need to
find a way to blow off steam.

29:38.144 --> 29:40.579
What, like kinky sex
with admins?

29:40.612 --> 29:41.580
Hey.
Yeah.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.850
Don't knock it
till you try it.
Yeah, no thanks.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.284
I think I'll stick to drumming.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.286
Drumming?
Yeah.

29:47.319 --> 29:48.955
Drums are a lot like
flying helos.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.357
Hands and feet
moving separately.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.993
So I bought a kit.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.829
(laughing)

29:56.863 --> 29:58.831
All right. You like
banging stuff, huh?

29:58.865 --> 30:02.268
I got just the thing.

30:02.301 --> 30:05.171
Reason I started coming here
in the first place.

30:05.204 --> 30:06.839
(inhales sharply)

30:06.873 --> 30:10.142
(groaning, shouting)

30:14.346 --> 30:17.816
Want to try it? Come on.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.888
Why not?

30:25.191 --> 30:27.326
Go wild, baby.

30:28.961 --> 30:29.996
Yeah.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.867
Yeah!
(laughing):
Hooah!

30:34.901 --> 30:35.834
Show that wall.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.138
Yeah!

30:39.171 --> 30:42.975
GALLO:
Hooah! Let go! Yes!

30:43.009 --> 30:46.345
Yeah. All right,
whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

30:46.378 --> 30:47.479
You're freaking me out.
Hey, Nora.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.917
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

30:50.950 --> 30:51.918
Hey.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.953
(panting)

30:58.057 --> 30:59.892
You all right?

31:01.227 --> 31:03.095
* You can holler, you can wail

31:03.129 --> 31:05.031
* You can swing, you can flail

31:05.064 --> 31:08.267
* You can thump
like a broken sail *

31:08.300 --> 31:10.937
* But I'll never give you up

31:10.970 --> 31:12.071
* If I ever give you up

31:12.104 --> 31:16.508
* My heart will surely fail

31:16.542 --> 31:19.878
*

31:24.150 --> 31:26.018
We could be court-martialed
for this.

31:26.052 --> 31:29.956
We already have secrets.
What's one more?

31:32.158 --> 31:33.960
No.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.963
You can't tell me
you don't want this, too.

31:42.969 --> 31:45.972
Duty is the cure for weakness.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.407
Sir.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.265
* If I could be alone...

32:13.299 --> 32:15.101
What are you doing here?

32:15.134 --> 32:16.602
Came by to talk to you
about something.

32:16.635 --> 32:20.106
Didn't expect you'd
be out till 1:00.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.974
Well, you should've
called first.

32:22.008 --> 32:22.741
Now, my other girlfriend,
she likes it

32:22.774 --> 32:24.310
when I surprise her, so...

32:24.343 --> 32:27.413
* If I could be alone...

32:27.446 --> 32:29.648
You're not gonna tell me
where you were?

32:29.681 --> 32:31.450
Needed to clear my head.

32:31.483 --> 32:32.484
The other night, too?

32:32.518 --> 32:34.586
* Needs a space to be in...

32:34.620 --> 32:35.754
Look, OGA has her eye on you.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.556
That's what I came
here to say.

32:37.589 --> 32:40.026
You have any idea why?

32:40.059 --> 32:41.994
* Flowing through space...

32:42.028 --> 32:43.029
Look, Ian, I'm tired.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.563
And I have
my flight test tomorrow.

32:44.596 --> 32:45.998
I-I work in intelligence.

32:46.032 --> 32:46.932
It-it is my job

32:46.965 --> 32:50.002
to know when someone
is hiding something.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.270
And you are.

32:51.303 --> 32:52.704
* Threads flowing...

32:52.738 --> 32:54.006
Ever since you got back.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.707
* Through space

32:55.741 --> 32:58.777
* Everyone can breathe now...

32:58.810 --> 33:01.147
You can tell me, Nora.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.282
There's nothing to tell.

33:03.315 --> 33:07.686
* Everyone can breathe now.

33:16.195 --> 33:19.098
(door closes)

33:43.255 --> 33:45.357
(drums continue)

33:59.571 --> 34:00.839
GALLO:
System?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.508
MADANI: Check.
GALLO: Flight instruments?

34:02.541 --> 34:04.343
MADANI: Set.
GALLO: Fuel system?

34:04.376 --> 34:06.078
Direct.

34:06.112 --> 34:07.045
Rock and roll.

34:10.382 --> 34:11.783
Are we good?

34:13.285 --> 34:14.586
All squared away.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.688
* Give me a hand,
give me a hand *

34:16.722 --> 34:18.690
* Give me a hand, give me
a hand... *

34:18.724 --> 34:21.093
(helicopter blades whirring)

34:29.268 --> 34:31.603
* I'd cut out my tongue
for things to say *

34:31.637 --> 34:33.239
* Just to break the spell *

34:33.272 --> 34:35.107
* I'd trade all my luck
for cards to play *

34:35.141 --> 34:37.109
* And I play them well *

34:37.143 --> 34:38.577
* I cool myself off
to feel the heat *

34:38.610 --> 34:39.878
* You're accustomed to hell... *

34:39.911 --> 34:40.879
I think it's time you told me.

34:40.912 --> 34:43.349
What is that thing?

34:44.816 --> 34:47.386
It was a gift
from a little Afghan girl.

34:47.419 --> 34:50.889
She said, until me, she didn't
know women could be soldiers.

34:50.922 --> 34:54.226
Now it's your rabbit's foot?
It's kept me alive so far.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.227
Let's hope
that doesn't change today.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.201
PILOT:
This is Renegade One-Three,
we've got the left course.

35:02.234 --> 35:03.169
PILOT 2: Roger.
This is Renegade One-Four,

35:03.202 --> 35:05.137
I've got the right course.

35:05.171 --> 35:08.207
MADANI: Roger that. Renegade
One-Two, we're down the middle.

35:08.240 --> 35:11.243
* I'll trade a window
for a wall *

35:11.277 --> 35:14.180
* I have to rise
for you to fall. *

35:54.353 --> 35:57.323
* Hello, my baby

35:57.356 --> 36:01.460
* Hello, my honey,
hello, my ragtime gal *

36:01.493 --> 36:04.230
* Send me a kiss by wire

36:04.263 --> 36:07.199
* Baby, my heart's on fire

36:07.233 --> 36:08.734
* If you refuse me, I...

36:08.767 --> 36:11.703
(shouting)

36:11.737 --> 36:13.272
JIMMY:
God, ugh...

36:13.305 --> 36:13.972
* Hello, my baby

36:14.005 --> 36:16.242
* Hello, my honey, hello...

36:16.275 --> 36:17.243
(grunting)

36:18.877 --> 36:22.180
* Give me a kiss by wire...

36:32.291 --> 36:34.293
You're almost through.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.631
Heads up!
Branch at one o'clock...

36:42.301 --> 36:44.303
Nice. Okay.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.472
This is the end.

36:47.473 --> 36:49.275
You got to pull up.

36:53.312 --> 36:54.246
(whoops)

36:54.280 --> 36:56.248
You did it, Madani.

36:56.282 --> 36:57.249
Hooah.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.885
(whirring, rapid beeping)

37:01.953 --> 37:03.855
Sounds like we lost an engine.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.257
Confirmed. Engine two out.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.626
(metal shrieking)

37:07.659 --> 37:09.595
We just lost them both.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.497
(alarm beeping)

37:19.405 --> 37:20.839
COMPUTER:
Low rotor, low rotor...
Confirmed.

37:20.872 --> 37:22.841
Both engines are dead.
How's that even possible?

37:22.874 --> 37:24.075
The crew chief checked
everything this morning.
Main RPM is dropping.

37:24.109 --> 37:26.745
Restart with A.P.U.
No. We got to
initiate autorotation.

37:26.778 --> 37:28.847
We're losing altitude.
Yes, sir.

37:28.880 --> 37:29.815
MADANI:
Reducing collective.

37:29.848 --> 37:31.650
RPM rising.

37:31.683 --> 37:32.651
80, 85.

37:32.684 --> 37:33.719
Not enough.

37:33.752 --> 37:34.986
You need to get
the air speed up.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.922
COMPUTER:
Low rotor, low rotor...

37:36.955 --> 37:38.290
MADANI:
RPM is at a hundred percent.

37:38.324 --> 37:39.425
We're 60 feet off deck.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.659
Cyclic back,

37:40.692 --> 37:42.428
collective up,

37:42.461 --> 37:43.695
pedal in.

37:43.729 --> 37:44.796
(clattering)

37:44.830 --> 37:46.698
(alarm beeping)

37:51.837 --> 37:53.705
(exhales)

37:58.710 --> 38:00.512
Congratulations.

38:00.546 --> 38:02.748
Now you passed my test, too.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.816
What?

38:04.850 --> 38:06.352
I shut the engines off.

38:07.853 --> 38:08.954
Why would you do that?

38:08.987 --> 38:10.456
I needed to be sure you could
hold up under pressure.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.857
Last time, you froze.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.825
(radio crackles)

38:13.859 --> 38:15.661
Don't you ever do
anything like that

38:15.694 --> 38:17.896
to me again, you understand?

38:17.929 --> 38:19.064
It was a training exercise.

38:19.097 --> 38:20.666
I need to be able
to trust you, Gallo.

38:20.699 --> 38:21.833
Whoa, whoa.
If we can't trust

38:21.867 --> 38:23.802
each other,
we can't trust anyone.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.478
(helicopter whirring)

38:32.511 --> 38:33.879
(radio crackles)

38:35.914 --> 38:37.783
Renegade One-Two,

38:37.816 --> 38:39.485
returning to base.

38:39.518 --> 38:40.619
MAN (over radio):
Renegade One-Two,

38:40.652 --> 38:44.423
Anchor Zero-Two, RTB.

38:45.924 --> 38:48.594
(grunting)

38:48.627 --> 38:50.729
You got it?

38:50.762 --> 38:53.532
All right. Now,
your turn. Come on.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.066
You got it. Okay.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.703
All right. Hey, hey!

38:57.736 --> 38:59.004
Hey. Hey.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.372
This is it, rotor-head.

39:00.406 --> 39:02.040
Okay? We're all in now.

39:03.642 --> 39:04.710
Okay.

39:04.743 --> 39:06.612
Sit up.

39:08.046 --> 39:09.915
(grunting)
(zip tie snaps)

39:09.948 --> 39:11.917
CRANK:
All right.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.919
(helicopter door opens)

39:21.993 --> 39:22.961
Nice work, soldier.

39:22.994 --> 39:23.962
Yeah, thank you, sir.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.130
Yes, congratulations.

39:25.163 --> 39:26.432
I look forward to
working together,

39:26.465 --> 39:27.533
Ms. Madani.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.801
Welcome to Operation Perseus.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.512
I'm proud of you.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.049
About last night...

39:44.082 --> 39:46.084
We don't have to talk
about it right now.

39:48.754 --> 39:49.755
Let's go.

39:53.825 --> 39:54.793
You killed it.

39:54.826 --> 39:55.927
(chuckles)

39:55.961 --> 39:57.729
(laughs softly)

40:19.017 --> 40:20.919
(grunting)

40:23.855 --> 40:25.524
Come on.

40:27.693 --> 40:28.827
Okay.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.696
(Madani and Gallo panting)

40:32.097 --> 40:34.666
He's not breathing.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.044
(coughing)

40:48.079 --> 40:49.848
You should've let him drown.

40:53.018 --> 40:53.819
Step away, Captain.

40:53.852 --> 40:54.920
Wait a minute.

40:54.953 --> 40:57.088
I'm an American citizen!

40:57.122 --> 40:58.757
Don't let him do this!

40:58.790 --> 41:00.158
I gave you
an order, Captain.

41:00.191 --> 41:02.628
Move, or I will
shoot through you.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.696
Listen to me.
His name is Richard Lasky,

41:04.730 --> 41:06.832
and he's the one
who sent me here!

41:12.938 --> 41:15.073
Your choice, soldier.

41:16.908 --> 41:18.877
(panting)

41:32.758 --> 41:35.060
(grunts)

41:47.973 --> 41:48.974
It's pitch black.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.709
I lost him out there.

41:52.911 --> 41:54.880
He's dead.
