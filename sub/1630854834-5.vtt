WEBVTT

00:08.383 --> 00:12.595
I'm goin' down to South
Park, gonna have myself a time.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.681
Friendly faces
everywhere, humble folks

00:14.681 --> 00:16.141
without temptation.

00:16.141 --> 00:19.018
Goin' down to South Park,
gonna leave my woes behind.

00:19.018 --> 00:20.937
Ample parking day
or night, people

00:20.937 --> 00:22.480
spouting, "howdy neighbor."

00:22.480 --> 00:25.567
Goin' on down to South Park,
gonna see if I can't unwind.

00:29.112 --> 00:34.367
Come on down to South Park
and meet some friends of mine.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.706
Fellas!

00:39.706 --> 00:41.332
Hey, fellas, you're not
going to believe it.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.584
Butters, what the
hell are you wearing?

00:42.584 --> 00:44.753
I got a job over at
the ice cream shop.

00:44.753 --> 00:45.628
And guess what?

00:45.628 --> 00:48.673
I got my very first paycheck.

00:48.673 --> 00:49.674
That's not fair.

00:49.674 --> 00:50.675
I want a paycheck.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.051
My dad told me
if I got a job,

00:52.051 --> 00:54.679
we could put my paychecks
in my very own bank account.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.139
I want a bank account.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.474
I didn't know
kids could get jobs.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.933
Yeah.

00:58.933 --> 01:00.143
Well, I guess these days,
it's real hard for businesses

01:00.143 --> 01:01.895
to find people to
work so they'll

01:01.895 --> 01:03.062
take whatever they can get.

01:03.062 --> 01:04.814
I want to take
whatever I can get.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.609
It's what they call the Great
Resignation labor shortage.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.319
So now if you have your
parent's permission,

01:09.319 --> 01:10.945
there's some jobs
they'll even let kids do.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.197
That is messed up.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.281
Why does he get to have a job?

01:13.281 --> 01:14.532
I want a job.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.659
You wouldn't last four
hours on a job, fat ass.

01:16.659 --> 01:17.494
Excuse me?

01:17.494 --> 01:18.870
That's easy for you to say.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.497
You don't need a job because
you live in a nice house.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.499
I have to live in a
shithole like Kenny does.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.334
It's not fair that some
people in our country

01:24.334 --> 01:26.085
are given the opportunity
for employment

01:26.085 --> 01:30.006
while others aren't.

01:30.006 --> 01:34.928
I'm going to tell my mom.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.054
Mom, mom!

01:36.054 --> 01:37.680
I need your permission
to get a job.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.767
Oh, you're too young
to have a job, sweetie.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.603
Butters got a job.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.355
Mom, look at this
shithole we live in.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.898
Somebody has to get
a job because you

01:46.898 --> 01:48.441
just sit on your ass all day.

01:48.441 --> 01:51.444
I had a job, Eric, but
you got me fired because you

01:51.444 --> 01:53.154
wanted me taking care of you.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.365
And that's why we had
to sell our house.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.117
Yes, right, because
I'm the man of the house.

01:58.117 --> 01:59.369
You're supposed
to take care of me

01:59.369 --> 02:00.620
and I'm supposed
to go get a job.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.038
You really expect
us to live like this

02:02.038 --> 02:03.623
the rest of our lives?

02:03.623 --> 02:06.376
This is not a proper
place to raise a child!

02:06.376 --> 02:08.294
You have to let me
go find a job, Mom.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.213
Eric, the truth is,
I don't think you'd

02:10.213 --> 02:11.923
last four hours at a job.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.550
Oh, now you sound like Kyle.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.009
Do you run Hollywood with him?

02:15.009 --> 02:16.386
Are you a Jew too, Mom?

02:16.386 --> 02:17.929
All right, Eric, fine.

02:17.929 --> 02:20.223
You want to go get a job and
have a little dose of reality?

02:20.223 --> 02:22.267
Maybe it'll be good for you.

02:22.267 --> 02:23.893
Thanks, Mom.

02:23.893 --> 02:26.062
I love you.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.439
Loo, loo, loo,
I'm serving in ice cream.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.275
Loo, loo, loo,
you'll eat it too.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.569
Loo, loo, loo, I'm
serving ice cream.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.571
OK, and the pistachio
maple cream.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.823
Let me know if you need
extra napkins for your table

02:36.823 --> 02:37.907
and have a creamy day.

02:40.743 --> 02:42.078
Oh.
Hey, Eric.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.037
Hey, Butters.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.372
I'm here for my job.

02:44.372 --> 02:45.373
What are you talking about?

02:45.373 --> 02:46.416
My mom gave me permission.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.625
I can start work now.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.960
What do I do?

02:48.960 --> 02:50.587
Well, but Eric,
this is my job.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.046
Yeah, I want
your job, sitting

02:52.046 --> 02:53.548
around eating ice cream.
Sounds fun.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.757
Eric, there's
a lot more to it

02:54.757 --> 02:56.342
than that and I already
do this job so--

02:56.342 --> 02:57.594
Everything all
right, Butters?

02:57.594 --> 02:59.095
Oh.
Yes, Mr. Sullivan.

02:59.095 --> 03:00.221
I was just--
- Hello, sir.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.514
I'm a dear friend of Butters.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.807
He told me all about
this place and said

03:02.807 --> 03:04.809
I should get permission
from my mom to work here.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.019
Oh.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.937
Well, uh, I do need
all the help I can get.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.355
Butters, can you vouch for him?

03:09.355 --> 03:11.733
Is he trustworthy and reliable?

03:11.733 --> 03:18.031
Uh, oh, um, OK.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.407
All right.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.867
Well, let's find him
a uniform and you

03:20.867 --> 03:22.243
can start training him.

03:22.243 --> 03:28.958
Hey, man, I got a job.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.084
All right, Eric.

03:30.084 --> 03:31.210
So there's three
types of ice cream.

03:31.210 --> 03:32.962
Waffle cone, sugar
cone, and cups.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.631
Uh-huh, and when do
we get to have breaks?

03:34.631 --> 03:37.717
Well, you get a 10 minute
break every two hours

03:37.717 --> 03:39.677
but only after you check
all the freezers, which

03:39.677 --> 03:42.388
are right over there, and need
to always be set to 0 degrees.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.973
OK, and how much longer
do we have to be here?

03:43.973 --> 03:45.850
Eric, please, I don't
want to lose this jo--

03:45.850 --> 03:46.935
oh.
Hello, sir.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.311
Hope you're having
a creamy day.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.729
What can I get for you?

03:49.729 --> 03:52.190
Can I have a single scoop
of coconut almond fudge?

03:52.190 --> 03:53.733
OK.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.194
Eric, can you scoop out
some coconut almond fudge?

03:56.194 --> 03:57.403
Why?

03:57.403 --> 03:58.947
Because it's your job, Eric.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.323
Whoa, Butters.

04:00.323 --> 04:03.826
Let's not make this a
toxic work environment, OK?

04:03.826 --> 04:04.827
One second, sir.

04:04.827 --> 04:10.792
I'll get that scoop.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.669
Yeah, I got a job
in an ice cream shop.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.295
Yeah, it's dumb as
hell but I'm going

04:14.295 --> 04:16.339
to start getting paychecks.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.299
Butter-- Butters,
what is this about?

04:18.299 --> 04:19.467
Oh, sorry, sir.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.843
Eric?
- Yeah, I know.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.012
She's pretty hot but
she's got droopy boobs.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.222
Eric!

04:24.222 --> 04:25.390
Eric, you can't just
sit there at a table.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.766
Yeah, I can.
It's Monday.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.017
So?

04:28.017 --> 04:29.602
So haven't you heard
of bare minimum Mondays?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.062
It's a thing that young
people have created because we

04:31.062 --> 04:32.355
care about our mental health.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.523
I don't care if it's
bare minimum Mondays.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.899
Eric, you need to--

04:34.899 --> 04:35.900
Oh, break time.

04:35.900 --> 04:42.115
I'll be back.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.453
Butters!

04:47.453 --> 04:48.538
Butters, we got a
line out the door.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.039
People are getting upset.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.124
I know, sir, I'm sorry.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.625
Well, where is your friend?

04:52.625 --> 04:55.128
He-- he hasn't come
back from his break yet.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.963
Butters Stotch?

04:56.963 --> 04:57.922
Yes?

04:57.922 --> 05:02.301
Delivery for you.

05:02.301 --> 05:03.302
Hey, Butters.

05:03.302 --> 05:04.262
Ah!

05:04.262 --> 05:06.055
Eric, where are you?

05:06.055 --> 05:07.682
I wasn't feeling the best so
I decided to work from home.

05:07.682 --> 05:09.434
Butters, what's going on?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.519
Uh, Eric says he's
going to work from home.

05:11.519 --> 05:12.937
How can he work from home?

05:12.937 --> 05:14.522
This is an ice cream shop!

05:14.522 --> 05:16.065
Yeah, no, 'cause
see, I'm actually

05:16.065 --> 05:17.567
taking a mental health day.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.360
Yeah, young people can just
ask for a mental health day

05:19.360 --> 05:20.361
and employers can't deny them.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.904
It's my mental health day.

05:21.904 --> 05:24.115
Eric, you need to
come here right now

05:24.115 --> 05:25.950
or we're both gonna get fired.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.368
OK, I guess so.

05:27.368 --> 05:34.542
But don't forget that tomorrow
is take it easy Tuesdays.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.254
OK, thanks for coming
and have a creamy day.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.422
Hi, hope you're
having a creamy day.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.631
Can I help you?

05:40.631 --> 05:42.008
You know what's total
bullcrap, Butters?

05:42.008 --> 05:43.718
It's how much money
the owner of this place

05:43.718 --> 05:45.762
is making while we're out
here busting our asses.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.680
I mean, what does
that old fart even do?

05:47.680 --> 05:50.641
Eric, could you please
fill this nice lady's order?

05:50.641 --> 05:54.270
Oh, yes, let me get that for
you, masa, right away, nah.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.521
I mean, seriously, Butters.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.606
Why do we have to
work for the owner?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.191
We know how to do
all this stuff now.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.525
We don't even need that guy.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.444
There has to be a way we
could turn the tables.

06:01.444 --> 06:05.281
There has to be a way we
could make all the money.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.282
Wait a minute--

06:37.313 --> 06:39.232
Butters!

06:39.232 --> 06:43.486
That's it!

06:43.486 --> 06:48.866
Eric!

06:48.866 --> 06:49.742
Kenny!

06:49.742 --> 06:51.077
Jesus Christ, dude.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.537
Kenny!

06:52.537 --> 06:54.080
Kenny, you're not
going to believe this,

06:54.080 --> 06:57.542
but I just quit my job.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.668
You had a job?

06:58.668 --> 07:00.128
Yes, I had a job.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.797
But I got fed up, sick of
working my fingers to the bone

07:02.797 --> 07:04.382
for some piece of shit owner.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.217
And that's when it hit me.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.303
Kenny, we should
open a restaurant.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.974
Why the fuck
would we open a restaurant?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.600
You know the hot dog
I've been living in?

07:14.600 --> 07:16.686
It's an old, like,
historic landmark.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.855
It's been sitting right in
front of us completely ready

07:18.855 --> 07:20.273
to go.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.984
All it would take is some minor
renovations and some care.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.361
We can make it awesome with
like, fun things for kids

07:25.361 --> 07:26.737
to do, and rides and games.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.865
A place that people
from all over Colorado

07:28.865 --> 07:30.616
would want to come and see.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.577
And we would be the owners.

07:32.577 --> 07:36.289
And we could have all
the hot dogs we wanted.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.582
Whoa.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.750
Aren't you sick of
living like this, Kenny?

07:39.750 --> 07:41.294
All we need is an
investor and we

07:41.294 --> 07:42.920
can make our dreams come true.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.839
And I know somebody
who has a bank account

07:44.839 --> 07:48.217
and gets paychecks every week.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.052
No.
No, no, no.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.387
Thank you, no.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.388
Butters, don't you
want to invest your money

07:52.388 --> 07:53.639
in something that matters?

07:53.639 --> 07:55.141
That's why we came
to your bank to offer

07:55.141 --> 07:56.684
you this awesome deal.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.228
What we can do, Eric, is set
up a line of credit for an LLC

07:59.228 --> 08:01.647
which then pays you back
not only your investment,

08:01.647 --> 08:03.649
but also principal
in the company.

08:03.649 --> 08:04.775
But I like my ice cream job.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.068
I don't want to open a hot dog.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.654
No, you keep working
at the ice cream shop.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.906
We're going to
open the hot dog.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.824
All you do is collect the
money as the investor.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.076
Yeah, but this is--
this is my money.

08:14.076 --> 08:15.453
I worked hard for it.

08:15.453 --> 08:18.372
Butters, it's just like,
you're lucky, you know?

08:18.372 --> 08:19.332
You have money.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.750
But look at Kenny.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.919
Can you imagine what it's
like for him watching

08:22.919 --> 08:24.837
rich white boys like you
just collecting paycheck

08:24.837 --> 08:27.048
after paycheck, while
he wallows in the filth

08:27.048 --> 08:28.132
of his tiny house?

08:28.132 --> 08:29.258
The fuck?

08:29.258 --> 08:30.801
Butters, Kenny
deserves a chance to be

08:30.801 --> 08:32.637
able to work like you do.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.223
Please, give him that chance.

08:35.223 --> 08:39.018
Ugh, I just give a bit of
my paycheck every week to

08:39.018 --> 08:40.228
you guys?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.604
And we pay you back
as soon as we make

08:41.604 --> 08:42.605
our first dollar, Butters.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.023
You have my word on it.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.274
Oh, OK.

08:45.274 --> 08:47.401
Yeah!

08:47.401 --> 08:50.154
Guys, we're going into
the restaurant business.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.377
Some
days won't end ever,

09:04.377 --> 09:05.878
and some days pass on by.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.923
I'll be working here forever,
at least until I die.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.801
Damned if you do,
damned if you don't.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.719
I'm supposed to get
a raise next week,

09:13.719 --> 09:14.971
you know damn well I won't.

09:14.971 --> 09:20.810
Workin' for a livin', workin'.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.896
Workin' for a livin',
livin' and a workin'.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.690
I'm taking what
they're giving because

09:25.690 --> 09:32.989
I'm workin' for a livin'.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.075
Hey, I'm not complaining
'cause I really need to work.

09:36.075 --> 09:39.578
But hittin' up my buddy's
got the feeling like a jerk.

09:39.578 --> 09:42.081
Hundred dollar car
note, 200 rent.

09:42.081 --> 09:45.501
I get a check on Friday
but it's already spent.

09:45.501 --> 09:51.632
Workin' for a livin', workin'.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.302
Workin' for a livin',
livin' and a workin'.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.596
I'm taking what they're
giving 'cause I'm working

09:56.596 --> 10:03.269
for a livin'.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.856
This is going to be the best
restaurant in Colorado, Kenny.

10:06.856 --> 10:11.402
And I know exactly
what we should name it.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.532
Tom, I'm standing out
front of a Colorado icon,

10:16.532 --> 10:19.160
the old Coney Island Hot
Dog, where the owners

10:19.160 --> 10:20.828
plan to reopen soon.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.789
The hot dog stand is going
through major renovations

10:23.789 --> 10:26.375
and the new name has
just been announced,

10:26.375 --> 10:30.004
DikinBaus Hot Dogs is sure
to be a big hit here in town.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.131
He said it!

10:32.131 --> 10:33.799
We got him to say
dick and balls!

10:35.051 --> 10:36.886
The owners say they're
planning on all kinds

10:36.886 --> 10:38.387
of rides and games.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.057
And also, with each hot dog
served here at DikinBaus Hot

10:41.057 --> 10:42.683
Dogs, they actually
use the ketchup

10:42.683 --> 10:45.144
to put a nice little
Smiley face on the plate.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.731
It's just their sort
of trademark touch.

10:48.731 --> 10:50.649
The renovations are
supposed to be finished soon

10:50.649 --> 10:53.444
and the new owners are inviting
everyone to come on down,

10:53.444 --> 10:57.990
enjoy, and let DikinBaus
put a smile on your buns.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.661
Le-- let DikinBaus put
a smile on your buns.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.665
Oh.
Hey, Butters.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.751
We have some of those
first quarter projections

11:08.751 --> 11:10.086
to show you.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.295
Do you have the first
quarter projections, Kenny?

11:11.295 --> 11:12.088
Uh, let me see.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.422
Where did we put those?

11:13.422 --> 11:15.257
Are you guys just
playing around?

11:15.257 --> 11:16.717
No, we are
renovating and opening

11:16.717 --> 11:19.095
an amazing restaurant that
will be extremely profitable.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.180
Then why did you
name it DikinBaus?

11:21.180 --> 11:22.848
Butters, you
are the investor.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.308
We are the creatives.

11:24.308 --> 11:26.143
Well, stop being creative
and open the goddamn restaurant

11:26.143 --> 11:27.436
so I can get my money back.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.563
So stop dicking around
and wasting my money.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.690
Butters, at DikinBaus,
dicking around

11:31.690 --> 11:38.864
is all we do, dicking
around the competition.

11:51.293 --> 11:55.172
What on Earth?

11:55.172 --> 11:56.757
OK, that's good!

11:56.757 --> 11:58.926
Mermaid goes to the mermaid
grotto right over there.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.136
Eric!

12:00.136 --> 12:02.221
Eric, I think you've
done enough renovations.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.347
Mom, no offense,
but will you shut

12:03.347 --> 12:04.557
your mouth because
you know nothing

12:04.557 --> 12:06.183
about the restaurant business?

12:06.183 --> 12:08.269
Excuse me, are
you guys the owners?

12:08.269 --> 12:10.271
Yes, we're the owners.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.647
Well, we got
your zip line put

12:11.647 --> 12:13.190
in but this asphalt
is so old it's not

12:13.190 --> 12:15.067
going to hold the eye bolts.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.235
Well, what does that mean?

12:16.235 --> 12:17.653
I think you've
got to re-asphalt

12:17.653 --> 12:19.947
the entire parking area
or just lose the zip line.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.199
Well, obviously, we're not
going to lose the zip line.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.325
So let's see what we can do.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.577
All right.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.620
Well then, over here
on your mermaid grotto,

12:26.620 --> 12:28.581
the mermaid is in but
she can't actually

12:28.581 --> 12:30.958
spit water because there's
no plumbing underneath.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.293
Jesus Christ.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.462
Well, I guess we got to
find a way to add plumbing.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.046
All right, everyone,
it's looking good

12:36.046 --> 12:37.339
but we have a ways to go.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.341
I don't know about you,
but I am exhausted.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.759
I think we should just all
take the rest of the day

12:40.759 --> 12:43.429
off because it is wet's not
work to hard Wednesdays.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.680
All right.

12:44.680 --> 12:45.890
Oh, OK.

12:45.890 --> 12:52.730
Let's not work too hard.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.234
Back from work, Butters?

12:57.234 --> 12:58.194
Oh.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.904
Hey, Mom and Dad.

12:59.904 --> 13:03.157
You must be so tired from
selling all that ice cream.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.366
Well, yeah.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.285
It was a pretty long night.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.162
A long night, he says.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.538
That's great, Butters.

13:09.538 --> 13:13.000
Only problem is, if you're
really working at a job,

13:13.000 --> 13:17.046
then why is there $0
in your bank account?

13:17.046 --> 13:18.214
What?

13:18.214 --> 13:20.716
So now what are you
really doing, young man?

13:20.716 --> 13:21.759
$0?

13:21.759 --> 13:23.177
But I've been
working every day.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.220
Oh, sure.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.055
I know exactly how it is.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.224
You say you have to work so
you can get out of the house,

13:28.224 --> 13:31.060
get away from the family and
you go down to that glory hole

13:31.060 --> 13:32.269
down on Fourth and Larimer.

13:32.269 --> 13:33.646
Oh, my god.
Butters!

13:33.646 --> 13:35.397
And while your family
thinks you're at your job,

13:35.397 --> 13:36.857
you're actually
strapped face down

13:36.857 --> 13:39.527
on a bed at the Brighton
Motel, taking any load you

13:39.527 --> 13:40.402
can find on Adultfriendfinder.

13:40.402 --> 13:41.362
Ahh!

13:42.905 --> 13:44.657
It's the lies!

13:44.657 --> 13:46.033
I can't take anymore.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.244
I'm going to go to the office
and get some work done.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.999
That son of a gun.

13:53.999 --> 14:03.050
Wee!

14:04.343 --> 14:05.261
Oh, man.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.929
It's the stupid bank.

14:06.929 --> 14:07.721
Hey, Butters.

14:07.721 --> 14:08.931
Gosh dang it, Eric!

14:08.931 --> 14:10.349
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

14:10.349 --> 14:11.684
You can't just
take my money out

14:11.684 --> 14:12.560
of my gosh dang bank account--
- Butters--

14:12.560 --> 14:13.978
without my permission--

14:13.978 --> 14:16.438
Butter-- Butters!

14:16.438 --> 14:17.898
Butters, would you relax?

14:17.898 --> 14:20.401
Where's all the money
gone from my bank account?

14:20.401 --> 14:22.361
You said to get
things moving.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.572
We needed the
funds to go faster.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.448
You said you'd never
access my account

14:26.448 --> 14:27.616
without my permission!

14:27.616 --> 14:28.909
Butters, we're
about to reopen

14:28.909 --> 14:31.495
a historic landmark that
means something to people.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.289
You think I'm just doing
all this for the fun of it?

14:33.289 --> 14:34.790
Hang on a second.

14:34.790 --> 14:37.459
Wee!

14:37.459 --> 14:38.711
We're creating jobs, Butters.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.837
And we're helping people.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.964
Then open the
stupid place, Eric.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.257
Fine!

14:43.257 --> 14:44.550
We'll start hiring
tomorrow morning

14:44.550 --> 14:46.260
and we'll be open
by the afternoon.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.553
And trust me, Butters.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.180
When we open and you see
how successful it is,

14:50.180 --> 14:57.479
you're going to
apologize to me.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.151
What the hell is going on?

15:02.151 --> 15:03.235
Why is nobody showing up?

15:03.235 --> 15:05.070
I don't know, dude.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.071
Hey.
Hey!

15:06.071 --> 15:07.698
Excuse me.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.909
You want to come work at
DikinBaus for minimum wage?

15:10.909 --> 15:13.495
No.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.997
That's because your
generation is lazy.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.624
You got all comfy
during the pandemic.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.500
Nobody knows how
to work anymore!

15:24.173 --> 15:27.051
They're saying you people
here might have a job?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.010
Yes!

15:28.010 --> 15:30.512
Please, have a seat.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.765
Um, so, what kind of
experience do you have?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.933
Well, I was working
down at the Budd factory

15:34.933 --> 15:38.103
in Fort Collins but then Joe
Biden caused a recession,

15:38.103 --> 15:39.855
so they took my job.

15:39.855 --> 15:41.023
Whoa!

15:41.023 --> 15:42.608
Then I worked
over at Waffle House

15:42.608 --> 15:44.109
but they decided
they needed employees

15:44.109 --> 15:48.238
to be more "inclusive,"
so they took my job.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.573
Sorry to hear that.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.659
And then I got let go
from the bowling alley

15:51.659 --> 15:54.495
and all I want is a damn job.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.747
Well, I believe that
we here at DikinBaus

15:56.747 --> 15:58.957
would like to hire
you immediately.

15:58.957 --> 15:59.708
OK.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.502
Can I work from home?

16:01.502 --> 16:02.461
What?

16:02.461 --> 16:03.504
No, you can't work from home.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.588
It's a hot dog stand.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.465
Well, I could
work here but I'll

16:06.465 --> 16:08.300
need mental health
days off to deal

16:08.300 --> 16:09.760
with the toxic environment.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.178
Where do people
get this stuff?

16:11.178 --> 16:12.262
All right, fine.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.681
Never mind, we don't
want to hire you.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.641
You're going to take my job?

16:15.641 --> 16:17.518
They took my job!

16:17.518 --> 16:19.395
They took yer job!

16:19.395 --> 16:21.397
Took my job!

16:21.397 --> 16:22.648
Durk-a-dur!

16:33.200 --> 16:35.828
Took-er-jabs!

16:35.828 --> 16:37.162
Good morning, everyone.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.706
After an exhaustive
search for employees,

16:38.706 --> 16:43.711
we have determined that you
are the best of the best.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.756
Yes.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.258
We're sure you're excited to
be part of the DikinBaus team.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.677
And we are certainly
glad to have you here.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.803
We're happy to be here.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.221
Shut up, Scott.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.056
Now listen, it's going to
take dedication and drive

16:56.056 --> 16:57.057
to get this place open.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.434
Isn't that right, Kenny?

16:58.434 --> 16:59.893
Sorry, Kenny is working
from home today because it's

16:59.893 --> 17:00.978
his mental health day.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.271
Hey, guys.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.397
Hi.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.023
Now there may
not be many of us.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.191
But in order to open,
we're going to have to--

17:06.191 --> 17:07.985
Do I get mental
health days too?

17:07.985 --> 17:09.111
Oh, here we go.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.696
Fine, Clyde, what
days do you need

17:10.696 --> 17:11.739
to have mental health days?

17:11.739 --> 17:12.990
Well, how should
I know until I'm

17:12.990 --> 17:13.907
feeling mentally unhealthy?

17:13.907 --> 17:15.117
Goddammit, you guys.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.618
It isn't going to
work like this, OK?

17:16.618 --> 17:19.038
Um, I'm also going to need
5 minute breaks every hour

17:19.038 --> 17:20.622
to check my insulin levels.

17:20.622 --> 17:21.790
You're fucking joking.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.375
This is a goddamn
restaurant, you guys.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.294
There's no time for diabetes!

17:25.294 --> 17:27.045
You don't hear Mrs. Anderson
complaining about her

17:27.045 --> 17:29.048
time off.

17:29.048 --> 17:33.635
I don't work on
no-thinky Thursdays.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.970
Oh, that's it!

17:34.970 --> 17:36.221
That's it, I give up.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.639
It's impossible to open
any kind of business

17:37.639 --> 17:40.893
these days when this generation
doesn't know how to work.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.894
Hey, fellers.

17:41.894 --> 17:42.811
Oh, great.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.146
Now the bank is here.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.148
Scrooge McButters to
collect on his money.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.900
You haven't made any money.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.278
Butters, the
truth is, we tried.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.905
The fact of the matter
is, the US government

17:52.905 --> 17:54.782
failed this generation
by shutting down

17:54.782 --> 17:55.991
businesses in the pandemic.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.326
And now they don't
know how to go back.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.661
I'm sorry, but we
lost all your money.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.164
But there is a good side to
this because as you can see,

18:02.164 --> 18:03.832
I now have a house
that has slides,

18:03.832 --> 18:05.125
and games, and a
mermaid grotto.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.878
And you can come and
hang out all you want.

18:07.878 --> 18:12.674
Gosh dang it!

18:17.679 --> 18:19.014
Attention, everyone.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.891
DikinBaus is now
open for business.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.615
Welcome to DikinBaus.

18:36.615 --> 18:40.536
How can I help you?

18:44.665 --> 18:45.707
There you are, ma'am.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.042
Thank you.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.253
Oh, look at the little
smile on the plate, honey.

18:49.253 --> 18:53.715
Oh, you like that, don't you?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.724
You guys, it's working.

19:02.724 --> 19:03.725
We're doing it!

19:03.725 --> 19:04.726
All right!

19:09.064 --> 19:10.357
Mm.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.900
Hey, that's a
pretty good hot dog.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.695
I just love to have all the
fun stuff for kids to do here.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.997
Hey, great job, kid.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.748
You really did it, Eric.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.083
Congratulations, Eric.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.751
You're a hero.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.587
Oh, my god.

19:31.587 --> 19:36.884
This is a dream come true.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.594
Well, congratulations,
young man.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.596
DikinBaus Hot Dogs
is a big success

19:40.596 --> 19:43.223
and here's your first
return on your investment.

19:43.223 --> 19:45.392
I'm sure there's
many more to come.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.102
Oh, I made my
money back, huh?

19:47.102 --> 19:48.562
Now what I'm
thinking, Butters,

19:48.562 --> 19:50.439
is that we should grow
your business by applying

19:50.439 --> 19:53.192
for a corporate loan, which
could pay you dividends

19:53.192 --> 19:55.235
as you expand the
company into new areas.

19:55.235 --> 19:56.653
Yeah, I wasn't thinking that.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.989
See, all I ever wanted
was just to do my job,

19:58.989 --> 20:02.659
learn how to work, and help
Mr. Sullivan sell ice cream.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.703
So I'm thinking I'm actually
going to conduct a market

20:04.703 --> 20:06.330
analysis to look
for potential buyers

20:06.330 --> 20:09.124
and roll over the company
as an exit strategy.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.626
Well, you could
do that but I think

20:10.626 --> 20:12.461
you'd have trouble
getting investors

20:12.461 --> 20:15.797
who will commit major capital
for just partial ownership.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.132
Yeah.

20:17.132 --> 20:18.759
So that's why I want to
approach overseas investors

20:18.759 --> 20:20.886
who will buy the IP, the
restaurant operations,

20:20.886 --> 20:22.179
and the real estate outright.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.805
But you couldn't do
that because there's

20:23.805 --> 20:26.141
already tenants in the building
who have to be relocated.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.768
Yeah, I thought of that too.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.979
Come on in.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.648
Hello.

20:32.648 --> 20:36.026
Wait, so you two have already
discussed some kind of deal?

20:36.026 --> 20:37.402
Oh, yes.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.321
Butters and I have
been talking and we

20:39.321 --> 20:40.989
think that my
little Eric deserves

20:40.989 --> 20:47.162
to get exactly what he's
been wanting for a long time.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.121
No!

20:48.121 --> 20:49.164
No, what are you doing?

20:49.164 --> 20:50.082
DikinBaus is mine!

20:50.082 --> 20:56.171
You can't sell DikinBaus!

20:56.171 --> 20:57.172
No!
Take me back.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.173
No!

20:58.173 --> 20:59.549
Please!

20:59.549 --> 21:01.009
This picture go over
here, Ms. Cartman?

21:01.009 --> 21:01.969
Oh, yes.

21:01.969 --> 21:02.970
That's perfect.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.013
Thank you.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.848
Wha-- what is this?

21:06.848 --> 21:09.643
The new owners paid for us
to have our old house back.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.854
I don't want my old
house, I want DikinBaus!

21:12.854 --> 21:14.022
Come on.

21:14.022 --> 21:17.150
No!

21:17.150 --> 21:18.694
There you go, Eric.

21:18.694 --> 21:21.363
It's your old room just
like you always wanted.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.365
But I hate this stupid house!

21:23.365 --> 21:25.033
I don't want to be here.

21:25.033 --> 21:28.161
I want to be in DikinBaus!

21:28.161 --> 21:29.746
DikinBaus is awesome.

21:29.746 --> 21:30.872
This place sucks.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.082
Please!

21:32.082 --> 21:34.876
I want--

21:34.876 --> 21:37.421
DikinBaus!

21:37.421 --> 21:40.048
I want my DikinBaus!

21:40.048 --> 21:43.218
DikinBaus!
