00:00.083 --> 00:02.125
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.208 --> 00:03.583
My back. I threw it out.

00:03.667 --> 00:06.208
- Jeez, are you crying?
- Just a little.

00:06.291 --> 00:08.458
<i>Edie got an unexpected visitor.</i>

00:08.542 --> 00:09.750
Remember my little boy?

00:09.834 --> 00:11.250
I didn't know your son
was coming for a visit.

00:11.333 --> 00:13.583
His father just dumped him here
for four weeks.

00:13.667 --> 00:16.500
<i>Gabby became the object</i>
<i>of Victor's desire.</i>

00:16.583 --> 00:18.709
Have you not noticed? I'm a catch.

00:18.792 --> 00:21.417
I have noticed
and I'm throwing you back.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.208
<i>And as Mike struggled</i>
<i>to recall his past,</i>

00:24.291 --> 00:27.834
<i>Ian's jealousy spurred him to action.</i>

00:27.917 --> 00:30.041
- Will you be my wife?
- Yes!

00:34.750 --> 00:36.208
God, I'm so nervous.

00:36.291 --> 00:38.875
Don't be. They're going to adore you
as much as I do.

00:38.959 --> 00:41.500
Oh, thanks. I needed to hear that.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.583
Darling, thorns.

00:43.667 --> 00:46.250
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:47.208 --> 00:51.083
<i>If there was one thing</i>
<i>Ian Hainsworth was sure of,</i>

00:51.166 --> 00:55.750
<i>it was that his love for Susan Mayer</i>
<i>was indestructible.</i>

00:55.834 --> 00:59.333
<i>He knew this because</i>
<i>it had been tested again</i>

01:00.834 --> 01:02.417
<i>and again</i>

01:03.959 --> 01:05.333
<i>and again.</i>

01:07.041 --> 01:12.208
<i>Still, Ian had found a way to forgive</i>
<i>Susan her occasional lack of grace.</i>

01:12.291 --> 01:13.834
Oh, here they come.

01:16.041 --> 01:18.125
<i>The question now on his mind was...</i>

01:18.208 --> 01:19.375
Darling!

01:19.458 --> 01:21.625
<i>...would his parents be able</i>
<i>to do the same?</i>

01:21.750 --> 01:24.250
- Good to see you. Father.
- My dear boy.

01:24.333 --> 01:25.792
This is my fiancée, Susan.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.792
These are my parents,
Graham and Dahlia.

01:27.875 --> 01:29.041
Delighted.

01:29.125 --> 01:31.208
You weren't exaggerating,
she's a vision.

01:31.291 --> 01:34.125
Oh, it's so great
to finally meet both of you.

01:34.208 --> 01:36.959
- Oh, this is for you.
- Be careful, Mother!

01:38.125 --> 01:41.166
- Thorns.
- Ian, I know how to hold a rose.

01:41.250 --> 01:45.000
Yes, of course, of course.
I just didn't want Susan to...

01:46.667 --> 01:47.959
You're right, sorry.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.166
- Anyone hungry?
- Yes.

01:52.083 --> 01:54.875
So, one puts the meat
atop the burning coals?

01:54.959 --> 01:56.458
How wonderfully primal.

01:56.542 --> 02:02.000
Yes, I'll feel like some gloriously
rough-hewn cowgirl, enjoying her...

02:02.083 --> 02:05.000
- What's the word? Vittles?
- No, that can't be right.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.208
No, it is. It's "vittles."

02:08.166 --> 02:12.709
- So, can I get you something to drink?
- I'd adore just a thimble of gin.

02:12.792 --> 02:15.625
Oh, no. You stay, darling.
I can manage.

02:19.375 --> 02:22.166
It seems to be going rather well.
Touch wood.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.000
- Were you worried?
- Oh, you know,

02:24.083 --> 02:26.709
introducing one's fiancée
to one's parents is always a bit fraught.

02:26.792 --> 02:28.208
Oh, you don't have to tell me.

02:28.291 --> 02:31.667
The first time I met Dahlia's parents
was a complete disaster.

02:31.750 --> 02:35.083
We were at tea and there was
this plate of small cakes.

02:35.166 --> 02:38.375
And as I offered one to her mother,
I tipped the plate and plop!

02:38.458 --> 02:41.208
A scone fell right into
her ladyship's teacup!

02:41.291 --> 02:42.375
Ouch.

02:42.458 --> 02:45.750
Earl Grey everywhere.
On the cloth, her mother's skirt.

02:45.834 --> 02:50.333
- You must have been mortified.
- Oh, I was. It was an absolute debacle.

02:51.917 --> 02:53.125
Guys?

02:54.208 --> 02:56.834
Don't worry. She's all right.

02:57.917 --> 03:03.667
<i>Yes, Ian Hainsworth knew his love</i>
<i>for Susan was indestructible.</i>

03:04.375 --> 03:09.500
<i>Unfortunately for his mother,</i>
<i>chiffon was not.</i>

03:51.917 --> 03:54.250
<i>In every housewife's closet,</i>

03:54.333 --> 03:58.875
<i>there's a treasured article of clothing</i>
<i>that she refuses to part with.</i>

03:59.583 --> 04:04.709
<i>It might be an old cheerleader uniform</i>
<i>that symbolises her youth,</i>

04:05.667 --> 04:10.166
<i>or the last bikini she wore</i>
<i>before she had children,</i>

04:11.500 --> 04:16.333
<i>or a pair of expensive pants</i>
<i>she prays will come back in style.</i>

04:17.667 --> 04:22.834
<i>But for Gabrielle Solis,</i>
<i>every piece of clothing was a treasure,</i>

04:22.917 --> 04:26.792
<i>carefully selected,</i>
<i>beautifully maintained,</i>

04:26.875 --> 04:30.417
<i>and utterly irreplaceable.</i>

04:37.417 --> 04:39.250
I can't believe
you bought another bustier.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.917
I know. I should never
shop for lingerie when I'm horny.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.792
It's like buying groceries
when you're hungry.

04:43.875 --> 04:47.041
In a slump, huh?
How long has it been?

04:47.125 --> 04:48.959
About three weeks and I am dying.

04:49.041 --> 04:51.250
You know, I am this close
to seducing my gardener.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.500
Been there, done that.

04:53.583 --> 04:55.709
That scrumptious teenager of yours.

04:55.792 --> 04:57.542
- Hey, do you think?
- He's married.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.709
Oh, damn.

04:59.792 --> 05:02.291
How about that Victor Lang?
Have you two...

05:02.375 --> 05:03.583
No. God, no.

05:03.667 --> 05:06.333
As a matter of fact, I think
I'm dumping him after dinner tonight.

05:06.417 --> 05:09.875
Why? He's rich, he's gorgeous,
he's probably gonna be mayor.

05:09.959 --> 05:13.792
- I mean, what more do you want?
- I don't know. He's just too arrogant.

05:13.875 --> 05:16.208
He acts like I'm some trophy
he's already won.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.583
It's infuriating.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.792
Yeah, that's awful. Can I do him?

05:19.875 --> 05:22.709
Oh, stop it. You cannot be that hard up.

05:22.792 --> 05:25.208
Did I mention my gardener's 62?

05:26.792 --> 05:28.709
What the hell is this?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.458
Oh, my God!

05:45.083 --> 05:46.375
No!

05:49.417 --> 05:51.750
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

05:54.000 --> 05:56.625
Honey? Where's your uniform?

05:56.709 --> 05:59.250
Oh, crap. I left it at home again.

05:59.333 --> 06:03.166
Yeah, I figured you would. Again.
That's why...

06:05.208 --> 06:06.959
I pulled an extra one from the back.

06:07.041 --> 06:09.625
Oh, thanks. Are you sure it's the right...

06:09.709 --> 06:11.208
Yep. Your size.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Listen, I was thinking.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.083
Wouldn't it be better
if the staff wore a uniform,

06:18.166 --> 06:19.917
and you and I wore regular clothes?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.959
That way, it's like,
"Hi, welcome to Scavo's.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.625
"We're the Scavos."

06:23.709 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, but I like wearing the uniform.

06:26.083 --> 06:29.375
And when you don't,
it looks like we all work for you.

06:29.458 --> 06:30.625
Oh, good point.

06:30.709 --> 06:33.000
Okay, here's another good point.
I hate orange.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.834
- Since when?
- Since always.

06:34.917 --> 06:36.000
You know my closet.

06:36.083 --> 06:38.333
Surely, you've noticed
I don't own anything orange.

06:38.417 --> 06:40.250
- No, I hadn't really...
- Orange says, "Beware.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.083
"Something bad's gonna happen."

06:42.166 --> 06:45.083
That's why they use it for life vests
and traffic cones and convicts.

06:45.166 --> 06:48.417
- Lynette.
- Also, it washes me out completely.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.458
You're wearing the uniform.

06:53.834 --> 06:56.959
Are you speaking as my husband
or as my boss?

06:57.792 --> 06:59.333
Definitely your boss.

06:59.417 --> 07:02.834
Your husband, too damn scared of you.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.917
As well he should be.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.125
<i>As Edie walked home,</i>

07:10.208 --> 07:13.333
<i>all she could think of</i>
<i>was her non-existent love life.</i>

07:13.417 --> 07:14.792
Pass it to me, Carlos!

07:14.875 --> 07:17.667
<i>And how much</i>
<i>she wanted back in the game.</i>

07:19.166 --> 07:23.291
<i>It was just then she saw someone</i>

07:23.375 --> 07:25.834
<i>she might like to play with.</i>

07:30.542 --> 07:32.041
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:32.125 --> 07:35.041
Did you see that, Edie?
Kid's looking good, huh?

07:35.125 --> 07:36.250
Looking real good.

07:36.333 --> 07:39.417
- Can we play another game?
- No, it's lunchtime. You go wash up.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.625
- Bye, Carlos.
- Bye.

07:41.709 --> 07:44.041
Oh, you have been
so great with Travers.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.083
Let me take you out for steak tonight.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.625
You don't have to pay me back.
I'm having more fun than he is.

07:49.709 --> 07:53.959
Well, then, we'll just have to arrange
for another play date.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.500
Any time.

08:02.834 --> 08:06.083
- Look who's back.
- Yes, let's try this again, shall we?

08:06.166 --> 08:09.625
- Dahlia, I am so sorry about...
- Please, not another word.

08:09.709 --> 08:13.625
Chiffon at a barbecue?
I was asking to be immolated.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.834
- Drink with dinner, Mother?
- Oh, God, yes.

08:16.917 --> 08:20.125
Oh, not that chair. That's the wobbler.
I'm saving up for a new set.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.709
Here, sit here.

08:24.375 --> 08:28.250
Ian tells us you have a young daughter.
Won't she be joining us?

08:28.333 --> 08:31.500
Julie? No, she's at her father's
this weekend.

08:33.709 --> 08:35.792
Is something wrong?

08:35.875 --> 08:40.000
Well, it's just that Ian told us that
your husband had been gone for years.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.667
We assumed you were a widow.

08:42.750 --> 08:46.166
No, Karl's alive and kicking, sadly.

08:47.041 --> 08:49.792
So, you're a divorcée?

08:51.333 --> 08:53.625
What happened? Did he beat you?

08:53.709 --> 08:55.834
No. Of course not.

08:55.917 --> 08:59.041
She had ample grounds, Mother.
Karl was a shameless womaniser.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.583
So it was just adultery?

09:01.667 --> 09:03.375
Just adultery?

09:03.458 --> 09:08.083
To my way of thinking,
men are, by nature, weak.

09:08.166 --> 09:10.041
I think Graham will back me up on that.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.959
Really, Dahlia.

09:12.041 --> 09:14.625
If you want your marriage to last,

09:14.709 --> 09:16.959
when your husband strays,

09:17.041 --> 09:20.709
you extract some suitable penance

09:20.792 --> 09:22.375
and get on with it.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.709
Punish the sin but love the sinner.

09:25.792 --> 09:30.959
Yeah, well, with Karl I was more,
"Divorce the ass and seize the assets."

09:34.250 --> 09:37.166
So you'd better watch out.
Betrayal makes me vengeful.

09:37.250 --> 09:39.375
Well, that's good to know.

09:41.166 --> 09:43.000
Yes, it certainly is.

09:47.458 --> 09:49.750
Apparently, the water heater
in the attic had burst.

09:49.834 --> 09:53.625
Everything is ruined.
My clothes, my shoes, dresses.

09:53.709 --> 09:56.917
- Why are you smiling?
- Well, we have different perspectives.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.792
You see ruined clothes
and I see a woman

09:58.875 --> 10:01.166
who could suddenly
use a rich boyfriend.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.792
You will never be my boyfriend.

10:02.875 --> 10:04.917
Gabby, how much longer
are you gonna pretend

10:05.000 --> 10:06.333
you're not crazy about me?

10:06.417 --> 10:08.667
Not much longer. This is our last date.

10:08.750 --> 10:11.208
Didn't you say it was our last date
on our last date?

10:11.291 --> 10:12.500
I mean it this time.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.166
Yeah? Well, do me a favour.
Mean it next time.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.709
I'm getting an award tomorrow
at the Rotary Club.

10:16.792 --> 10:18.291
Boring.

10:18.375 --> 10:21.417
Come on, I want my date to be
the most beautiful woman in the room.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.959
Is that supposed to flatter me?

10:23.041 --> 10:25.333
Only if you've never seen
the women of the Rotary Club.

10:25.417 --> 10:29.250
Oh, shut up and get me a sweater.
Have you even noticed how cold I am?

10:29.333 --> 10:32.125
Noticed? It's made my whole evening.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.083
Sweater! Now!

10:35.834 --> 10:38.917
How about a nice cashmere cardigan?

10:45.917 --> 10:48.500
Oh, my God!

10:48.583 --> 10:51.041
- What?
- Look at this!

10:51.125 --> 10:56.417
There's Lacroix and Ungaro
and vintage Gaultier.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.917
Yeah, I don't really know
much about fashion.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.959
They can hear you.

11:01.750 --> 11:04.542
Oh, my God!
There's another rack back here!

11:04.625 --> 11:06.417
Is this all your ex-wife's stuff?

11:06.500 --> 11:09.000
Yeah. She's storing it here
until her new house is ready.

11:09.083 --> 11:12.333
Oh, my God! She wears my size.

11:12.417 --> 11:14.834
It's amazing. Nobody wears my size.

11:14.917 --> 11:16.583
Well, I guess I have a type.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.917
And normally that would creep me out,

11:19.000 --> 11:23.208
except it means that I can borrow
this one-of-a-kind Andare for our date.

11:23.291 --> 11:27.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Heel, girl.
This belongs to my ex.

11:27.375 --> 11:29.291
- So?
- So I don't think she'd appreciate me

11:29.375 --> 11:32.000
loaning her clothes to my girlfriend.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.250
Okay. A, I'm not your girlfriend.

11:34.333 --> 11:38.291
And B, she's not going to find out
unless you tell her.

11:38.375 --> 11:40.041
Come on!

11:40.667 --> 11:43.583
A dress this gorgeous
is meant to be seen.

11:43.667 --> 11:46.709
Every day it hangs in a closet,
an angel loses its wings.

11:46.792 --> 11:49.959
That's very cute,
but the answer is still no.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.875
Come on. Let's go.

11:59.291 --> 12:00.625
Gabby.

12:01.709 --> 12:04.375
I just wanted a moment to say goodbye.

12:08.917 --> 12:11.959
So, in the next scene,
the guy wakes up and the girl,

12:12.041 --> 12:14.667
Julia Roberts, Sandra Bullock,
one of those,

12:14.750 --> 12:18.000
is standing there
holding a tray of pancakes.

12:19.166 --> 12:22.542
- What happens then?
- I keep telling you, I don't remember.

12:22.625 --> 12:25.458
What's the difference?
It's just some stupid movie I saw.

12:25.542 --> 12:29.208
Yet every time you remember it,
you feel sad or upset.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.709
I think something happened
at that movie or just afterwards.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.500
Who did you see it with?

12:34.583 --> 12:37.291
Well, it's obviously some chick flick.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.417
So probably Susan.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.834
Well, why not ask her about it?

12:40.917 --> 12:42.125
Maybe she can tell you
what happened.

12:42.208 --> 12:44.834
No. No, I don't want to bother her.

12:44.917 --> 12:46.750
She just got engaged.

12:46.834 --> 12:50.083
Mike, this therapy isn't just about
recovering your memories.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.959
It's about you getting closure.

12:52.041 --> 12:54.125
Now, the emotions you're feeling
won't be resolved

12:54.208 --> 12:56.125
until you know what they're about.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.667
I don't know.

12:57.750 --> 13:01.291
Come on, talk to Susan.
What could it hurt?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.041
That's awesome.
I love model aeroplanes.

13:06.125 --> 13:08.083
- So you'll help me put it together?
<i>- Sure.</i>

13:08.166 --> 13:09.625
I'll see you tomorrow after school.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.917
- Can you come at 7:00 instead?
- Why so late?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.583
Mom says I can't play
till I finish my homework. Bye.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.542
He's coming.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.834
So can I stay up
and watch my show now?

13:19.917 --> 13:23.208
You can stay up
as late as you want, champ.

13:23.291 --> 13:27.542
Tomorrow, you are going to have
an early night.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.500
Your father's been up there
20 minutes.

13:34.583 --> 13:35.709
Are you sure he's okay?

13:35.792 --> 13:37.709
He's fine.
He always lies down after dinner.

13:37.792 --> 13:41.083
He says it helps his digestion.
Relax. It's going very well.

13:41.166 --> 13:43.041
I set your mother on fire.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.333
And you've been
relentlessly charming ever since.

13:45.417 --> 13:47.125
Trust me,
when she looks back on tonight,

13:47.208 --> 13:49.750
she won't even remember the fire.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.959
But she may remember this.

13:55.041 --> 13:58.542
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
Are you all right?

13:58.625 --> 14:00.750
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

14:00.834 --> 14:03.166
At least this blouse
made it through dinner.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.291
Let me get you a towel.

14:15.041 --> 14:16.583
Hello.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.750
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

14:18.834 --> 14:20.458
Dahlia has a birthday coming up

14:20.542 --> 14:22.750
and I saw this hanging there
and I thought,

14:22.834 --> 14:26.000
"A robe. Well, there's a notion."

14:26.083 --> 14:30.208
So I just tried it on
to get a sense of the drape.

14:31.667 --> 14:35.041
Were you also thinking
of getting her a lace bra?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.625
Oh, dear God!

14:37.625 --> 14:40.375
Please don't mention this
to any of my family.

14:40.458 --> 14:42.500
Just take the robe off.

14:45.375 --> 14:49.125
And whatever you have on underneath,
consider that yours.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.583
Be reasonable, dear.
I'm only trying to protect you.

14:54.667 --> 14:55.750
From Susan?

14:55.834 --> 14:57.166
Well, she doesn't care
about my money.

14:57.250 --> 14:58.333
She's never asked me for a cent.

14:58.417 --> 15:02.959
Your logic is as wobbly as the dining
room chairs she can't afford to replace.

15:03.041 --> 15:06.291
I love Susan
and I won't ask her to do this.

15:06.375 --> 15:09.583
Oh, hello. Mother's fine.
I found her a sweater.

15:11.041 --> 15:13.959
- So, what won't you ask me?
- Nothing.

15:14.041 --> 15:18.250
I was wondering if you'd object
to signing a document that says,

15:18.333 --> 15:21.291
should you and Ian part ways,

15:21.375 --> 15:23.375
you'll accept a cash settlement

15:23.458 --> 15:26.625
and not go after the money
he inherits from us.

15:28.458 --> 15:30.208
You mean a prenup?

15:30.291 --> 15:32.083
Please, try to understand.

15:32.166 --> 15:36.083
Our country estate
has been in our family for generations.

15:36.166 --> 15:40.625
We want it preserved
for the children we hope Ian will have,

15:40.709 --> 15:43.583
not lost in some pricey divorce.

15:43.667 --> 15:45.792
Well, who's getting divorced?

15:45.875 --> 15:47.917
I'm in this for keeps.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.959
I'm sure you said the same
to your first husband

15:50.041 --> 15:52.625
before you bolted
with all you could carry.

15:53.333 --> 15:56.458
- Hey...
- Mother, Susan is not signing anything.

15:57.375 --> 15:58.500
Fine.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.083
Then we'll leave it all to your brother.

16:01.166 --> 16:03.291
Oh, do you think Nigel's
going to give you a grandson?

16:03.375 --> 16:05.417
He's an alcoholic homosexual.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.500
With a castle at stake,
he can learn a new skill.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.417
Okay, stop this!

16:10.500 --> 16:12.792
We invited you here
to celebrate our engagement.

16:12.875 --> 16:15.667
Now I'm divorced
and Ian's disinherited?

16:15.750 --> 16:19.125
Hello. Have I missed anything?

16:19.208 --> 16:23.917
We'll be going soon.
Please don't be offended.

16:24.000 --> 16:29.375
All of us go into marriage convinced
that everything will be perfect.

16:29.458 --> 16:31.375
God knows I did.

16:31.458 --> 16:36.250
And then one day I found a bill
for some expensive lingerie.

16:36.333 --> 16:41.166
Bustiers, peignoirs,
none of it in my size.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.500
Certainly opened my eyes.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.792
Mother, I'm not like my father.

16:45.875 --> 16:47.750
Trust him. He's not.

16:49.166 --> 16:50.750
I'm sorry, Ian.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.709
Hey, guys.

17:02.625 --> 17:05.542
Hey, Mrs Scavo. I'm sorry.
We were just taking a quick break.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.917
- We'll get back to work.
- No, no, don't be silly.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.709
Who am I, Tom?
I'm one of you guys. Sit down.

17:15.083 --> 17:19.000
Hey, you know what we could use?

17:21.375 --> 17:26.291
A good old-fashioned bitch session.
Get some stuff off our chests.

17:26.375 --> 17:29.959
So, what's bugging you guys?
Okay, I'll go first.

17:30.041 --> 17:34.083
How do we feel about these uniforms?
A little "eh"?

17:37.208 --> 17:38.792
They're okay.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.375
But, hey, why do we
have to pool our tips?

17:41.458 --> 17:43.083
Why can't we just keep what we earn?

17:43.166 --> 17:45.125
Good point, good point.

17:45.208 --> 17:49.250
But right now we're talking about
these ugly-ass uniforms.

17:49.333 --> 17:51.959
You know what bugs me?
No health benefits.

17:52.041 --> 17:55.041
- I'm kind of worried about this mole...
- Focus, people!

17:55.125 --> 17:59.000
The subject is shirts.
It's killing morale.

17:59.083 --> 18:02.208
- I kind of like them.
- Really, Kim?

18:02.291 --> 18:05.125
'Cause I heard
one of your customers say

18:05.208 --> 18:09.375
that when Halloween comes around,
we should stick a candle in your mouth.

18:09.458 --> 18:11.458
See? Morale.

18:11.542 --> 18:13.709
You guys need
to stand up for yourselves.

18:13.792 --> 18:14.917
It's your right.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.375
No, it's your obligation
to go to management

18:18.458 --> 18:20.375
and demand new shirts.

18:20.458 --> 18:24.583
And if management doesn't like it,
you tell him he can go screw...

18:24.667 --> 18:28.000
Okay. Okay. Break's over, people.

18:28.083 --> 18:30.291
I'm gonna go find Tom and talk.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.750
Oh, good.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.542
I can't believe
you tried to undermine me like this.

18:44.625 --> 18:47.250
Well, you gave me no choice.

18:48.166 --> 18:51.333
It's just a uniform.
Why can't you wear it?

18:51.417 --> 18:53.542
Because I need to win one, Tom.

18:53.625 --> 18:54.667
What?

18:54.750 --> 18:58.375
You keep ordering me around and
disagreeing with me and overruling me,

18:58.458 --> 18:59.709
and I'm sick of it.

18:59.792 --> 19:02.375
We have to do things my way
at least every once in a while.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.917
This was the deal, Lynette.
You agreed.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.041
I'm in charge here,
you're in charge at home.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.792
Except we're never home.
We live here.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.041
Our marriage happens here.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.417
You know what?
We can't talk about this now.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.792
We open in 10 minutes. Maybe later...

19:17.875 --> 19:21.125
Later, I'll be asleep, and then
I will be back here before you wake up.

19:21.208 --> 19:23.041
We gotta deal with this now.

19:23.125 --> 19:24.792
Okay. All right.

19:26.417 --> 19:28.208
We're gonna deal with this now.

19:28.291 --> 19:29.959
I'm gonna get ready for the dinner rush,

19:30.041 --> 19:33.000
and you're gonna wear
the damn uniform.

19:41.417 --> 19:42.542
No.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.792
What?

19:46.417 --> 19:48.000
I'm going home.

19:49.291 --> 19:51.375
You're walking out on me?

19:53.208 --> 19:56.875
I told you orange meant
something bad was gonna happen.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.875
Hi. Remember me?
I had dinner here the other night.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.417
Anyway, I was driving through
your neighbourhood

20:17.500 --> 20:19.083
after having, like, 30 iced teas.

20:19.166 --> 20:22.667
And I really have to go to the bathroom.
Do you mind?

20:43.792 --> 20:47.500
You and I are gonna be
so happy together.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.875
I feel 10 pounds lighter. Thank you.

21:27.333 --> 21:30.583
Hey, you got a minute?
I need your help with something.

21:30.667 --> 21:33.500
Oh, I should probably get these inside.

21:33.583 --> 21:36.500
Please. I need to ask you
about a movie.

21:41.250 --> 21:42.625
And so the last part I remember,

21:42.709 --> 21:46.041
the girl is putting these raw pancakes
in front of him,

21:46.125 --> 21:47.834
and then something else funny
happened.

21:47.917 --> 21:50.792
I don't remember.
It was just a stupid chick flick.

21:51.834 --> 21:54.625
Mike, it wasn't a movie. That was us.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.250
What?

21:57.500 --> 21:59.041
Yeah.

21:59.542 --> 22:01.709
That was the first night
that we spent together.

22:01.792 --> 22:03.542
I wanted to surprise you.

22:03.625 --> 22:06.834
- With raw pancakes?
- They weren't all raw.

22:06.917 --> 22:09.959
I was trying to spell "Mike"
and the "M" was goopy.

22:10.041 --> 22:12.333
But the "ike" was delicious.
You loved it.

22:12.417 --> 22:14.542
- I did, huh?
- Actually, no, it was gross.

22:14.625 --> 22:15.792
But you were really sweet.

22:15.875 --> 22:18.542
You just gave me a lot of kisses
and said not to worry,

22:18.625 --> 22:21.458
I'd get a lot of chances
to make you pancakes 'cause...

22:21.542 --> 22:25.875
'Cause I was planning on spending
the rest of my mornings with you.

22:28.959 --> 22:30.500
You remember.

22:31.625 --> 22:32.834
Yeah.

22:37.750 --> 22:41.375
I should go
'cause Ian's parents are here.

22:50.542 --> 22:54.125
It's nice to see you.
Thank you both for coming.

22:54.208 --> 22:58.500
You know, I know I've said it 10 times,
but you look fantastic.

22:58.583 --> 22:59.917
And my offer still stands.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.917
You do not have to pay for my dress.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Come on, you only need it
for my luncheon.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.542
And it looks like it cost a bundle.

23:06.625 --> 23:08.917
Trust me, it was a steal.

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
I'm gonna go powder my nose,
and then you can start showing me off.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.333
Heads up, I just saw your ex-wife.

23:18.417 --> 23:19.834
What is she doing here?

23:19.917 --> 23:22.083
Some friend of hers
is getting a plaque, too.

23:22.166 --> 23:24.542
You want to duck out
after your speech?

23:24.625 --> 23:29.166
Are you kidding? I can't wait until
she gets a good long look at Gabby.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.500
Hey.

23:40.291 --> 23:41.542
Hello.

23:42.709 --> 23:44.542
I love your dress.

23:45.083 --> 23:47.542
- Thanks.
- It's one-of-a-kind, isn't it?

23:47.625 --> 23:49.083
Yeah. Couture.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.291
Andare?

23:52.500 --> 23:53.750
Wow. Good eye.

23:53.834 --> 23:56.834
Well, I do have an unfair advantage.

23:58.041 --> 23:59.542
I bought it.

24:01.583 --> 24:03.250
So you're...

24:05.166 --> 24:07.792
Well, first, let me just say,
you have amazing taste.

24:07.875 --> 24:10.667
If we had met in any other context,
we would so get along.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.458
I left those clothes with Victor
so he could store them,

24:13.542 --> 24:15.750
not loan them to his sluts.

24:16.750 --> 24:20.625
Okay, you're mad, so I'm just
gonna blow right by that slut crack.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.166
I want my dress back now.

24:23.250 --> 24:24.625
Okay, let's be reasonable.

24:24.709 --> 24:26.750
You can't wear two dresses
to one lunch.

24:26.834 --> 24:29.875
- It's not like I have a spare in the car.
- Not my problem.

24:29.959 --> 24:31.542
Give me back the dress!

24:31.625 --> 24:33.041
Go ahead. Yell all you want.

24:33.125 --> 24:36.083
You can't force me
to take off this dress.

24:36.166 --> 24:38.375
This is pepper spray.

24:38.458 --> 24:41.625
In three seconds,
your eyeballs will be on fire.

24:43.750 --> 24:46.250
Could you help me with the clasp?

24:48.750 --> 24:50.917
Hello, Samantha, I heard you were...

24:51.000 --> 24:52.917
Isn't that Gabby's dress?

24:56.875 --> 24:58.750
Gabby? You in there?

25:01.750 --> 25:03.208
Hey, Victor.

25:04.458 --> 25:07.625
You're probably wondering
why I've been in here so long.

25:07.709 --> 25:09.917
Funny story, I ran into your ex-wife.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.458
Yes, she brought me up to speed.

25:26.667 --> 25:29.125
Okay, it's time for bed, Travers.

25:29.208 --> 25:32.041
But I want to show Carlos
my new turtle.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.291
Oh, right.

25:34.375 --> 25:35.709
I'm tired.

25:35.792 --> 25:37.750
That's okay, buddy.
I got to get going, anyway.

25:37.834 --> 25:39.875
Why? You haven't even
finished your wine.

25:39.959 --> 25:43.875
Sorry, early day tomorrow.
Come on, kiddo. I'll tuck you in.

26:02.250 --> 26:04.083
Sleep tight, Travers.

26:04.166 --> 26:07.417
Oh, no! I'm such a klutz.
I think I broke it.

26:07.500 --> 26:10.458
No, no. It's just a flap. I can fix that.

26:17.417 --> 26:19.333
- Edie?
- Yeah?

26:20.709 --> 26:22.709
I can't see what I'm doing here.

26:22.792 --> 26:24.625
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:27.583 --> 26:32.500
Maybe I should watch,
so that if it breaks again, I can fix it.

26:32.583 --> 26:33.792
Okay.

26:33.875 --> 26:37.125
So, this hinge
needs to go in at this angle

26:37.208 --> 26:39.041
so that the flap works.

26:39.125 --> 26:42.000
- See?
- God, you're so mechanical.

26:43.834 --> 26:45.959
Edie, what are you doing?

26:46.041 --> 26:47.959
Learning about flaps.

26:48.959 --> 26:51.750
No, I think you're coming on to me.

26:51.834 --> 26:53.250
Maybe.

26:53.333 --> 26:55.834
Okay, Edie, no! Come on.

26:56.834 --> 26:58.875
We're close friends
and I don't want to ruin that.

26:58.959 --> 27:00.709
Well, we're not that close.

27:00.792 --> 27:02.542
Let's just do it, we'll see where it goes.

27:02.625 --> 27:04.959
Okay, you know what?
It wouldn't go anywhere.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.333
Why not?

27:08.083 --> 27:11.333
'Cause I'm looking for a girl
who wants to settle down

27:11.417 --> 27:13.542
and be in a serious relationship.

27:13.625 --> 27:17.792
- And you're not that type.
- Oh? What type am I?

27:18.667 --> 27:20.917
You're the fun type,

27:21.000 --> 27:24.375
who likes to dress sexy
and go out and meet new people.

27:24.458 --> 27:28.709
And then go out the next night
and meet another new people.

27:28.792 --> 27:30.458
You think I'm promiscuous?

27:30.542 --> 27:32.834
I'm just saying,
for a house on a cul-de-sac,

27:32.917 --> 27:34.291
this place sees a lot of traffic.

27:34.375 --> 27:35.625
Just because I'm popular

27:35.709 --> 27:39.917
doesn't mean that I'm incapable
of a lasting commitment.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.625
Look, you can't even commit
to your kid.

27:41.709 --> 27:43.333
He's here for a month
and you keep dumping him

27:43.417 --> 27:44.834
on neighbours so you can go shopping.

27:44.917 --> 27:48.250
That is, when you're not
using him for sex bait.

27:50.709 --> 27:53.375
Get out of my house.

28:00.583 --> 28:02.500
Tom, me again.

28:02.583 --> 28:04.291
You should have been home
30 minutes ago.

28:04.375 --> 28:06.250
I know, you're still mad. I am, too.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.792
So why don't you come home
and we can be mad together?

28:08.875 --> 28:10.375
See you soon.

28:11.083 --> 28:15.208
So, what kind of orange is this shirt?
Like a salmon or a coral?

28:16.667 --> 28:18.500
Oh, cheese doodle.

28:18.583 --> 28:21.583
Exactly. And I'm supposed to wear that
every damn day.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.291
Oh, please. It's not that bad.

28:23.375 --> 28:25.125
I once worked at this
fish-and-chip place.

28:25.208 --> 28:28.375
I had to wear an eye patch
and a stuffed parrot on my shoulder.

28:28.458 --> 28:31.959
"Would you like
to hear 'arggh' specials?"

28:32.041 --> 28:34.750
Why don't you just tell Tom
to pick another colour?

28:34.834 --> 28:38.417
This isn't about the shirt any more.
This is about us working together.

28:38.500 --> 28:42.000
Every day it's a battle.
It's hurting our marriage.

28:42.667 --> 28:46.166
You know what?
I'll just tell Tom I need to step back.

28:46.250 --> 28:47.375
You mean, quit?

28:47.458 --> 28:50.417
Yeah, we could hire a manager
or something.

28:50.500 --> 28:51.625
Wow.

28:52.458 --> 28:54.625
How do you think Tom's
gonna feel about that?

28:54.709 --> 28:58.208
Well, once he decides to stop hiding,
I can ask him.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.500
You know what? I'm tired of waiting.

29:01.583 --> 29:04.458
I'm gonna go down there
and I'm gonna talk to him.

29:04.542 --> 29:06.375
See you guys later.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.375
So, I guess this means
we're babysitting the kids, huh?

29:13.458 --> 29:14.667
Guess so.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.959
I'm an idiot. Would you guys mind...

29:17.041 --> 29:19.375
- We got it. Just go.
- Thanks.

29:32.709 --> 29:33.917
Tom!

29:35.625 --> 29:38.291
Come on, I know you're still here.

29:39.750 --> 29:42.000
You realise what time it is?

29:42.500 --> 29:46.667
I know, you're mad, but you just...

29:46.750 --> 29:49.458
You can't avoid me all night.

29:51.917 --> 29:54.667
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

29:54.750 --> 29:58.750
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, Tom. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

29:58.834 --> 30:03.208
Okay. Okay. You're breathing.
That's good. That's good.

30:06.333 --> 30:09.792
Hello? Hi. There's something wrong
with my husband.

30:10.709 --> 30:13.291
I don't know. He's unconscious.

30:14.250 --> 30:16.875
357 Hawthorne Place.

30:16.959 --> 30:19.125
Okay, could you please hurry?

30:19.208 --> 30:21.458
Thank you. Yes.

30:29.417 --> 30:30.834
Listen to me.

30:32.333 --> 30:34.333
I forbid you to die.

30:37.208 --> 30:41.625
If you leave me with a mortgage
and a restaurant and five kids,

30:41.709 --> 30:46.709
I swear, I will track you into the
deepest pit of hell and make you pay.

30:46.792 --> 30:48.417
Do you hear me?

30:50.625 --> 30:52.166
Come on, baby.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.792
Oh, please.

30:58.834 --> 31:01.542
So, that's it? He threw out his back?

31:01.625 --> 31:03.417
Oh, thank God.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.083
I'm guessing
he passed out from the pain.

31:06.166 --> 31:09.166
But I want to be clear.
A ruptured disc is very serious.

31:09.250 --> 31:10.625
He'll need surgery.

31:10.709 --> 31:12.750
It'll be a while
before he's back on his feet.

31:12.834 --> 31:15.208
- How much of a while?
- Well, three months.

31:15.291 --> 31:18.667
- Three months?
- Even then, he'll need to go easy.

31:19.709 --> 31:23.542
- What sort of work does he do?
- We run a restaurant.

31:23.625 --> 31:26.291
He shouldn't go back
for four or five months.

31:26.375 --> 31:28.917
Restaurant work is very stressful.

31:29.709 --> 31:31.208
Yeah, it is.

31:39.417 --> 31:40.583
What's that?

31:40.667 --> 31:44.000
Oh, it's the prenup
my parents want you to sign.

31:45.792 --> 31:48.000
And you brought it to bed?

31:48.875 --> 31:51.333
Okay. Romance tip number one...

31:51.417 --> 31:53.375
Sorry, I just can't get that off my mind.

31:53.458 --> 31:55.792
I keep thinking,
"Why all this ungodly fuss?

31:55.875 --> 31:58.208
"Susan's not in this
for money and heirlooms."

31:58.291 --> 32:00.750
Thank you.
I don't want your family's stuff.

32:00.834 --> 32:02.792
What am I gonna do with half a castle?

32:02.875 --> 32:04.458
Exactly.

32:04.542 --> 32:06.458
So why not just sign it?

32:07.250 --> 32:08.375
Huh?

32:08.458 --> 32:09.750
Well, I mean, looking at it rationally,

32:09.834 --> 32:12.250
what's the difference between making
the promise you just made to me

32:12.333 --> 32:14.583
and making the same promise
on paper?

32:17.750 --> 32:20.083
Well, the difference is huge.

32:20.625 --> 32:23.375
I mean, one way you're trusting me

32:24.375 --> 32:27.583
and the other way
you're trying to make it official.

32:27.667 --> 32:30.667
But isn't that what marriage is?
Making your love official?

32:30.750 --> 32:33.750
Ian, do you really want
to start our life together

32:33.834 --> 32:37.166
making me feel like I'm on probation?

32:38.083 --> 32:40.375
You know that I trust you.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.792
This isn't about my fears.
It's about my parents.

32:44.333 --> 32:45.625
Really?

32:46.834 --> 32:49.291
I think it's about someone else.

32:50.542 --> 32:54.250
He just wanted me
to help him remember something.

32:54.333 --> 32:55.875
- Who?
- Mike.

32:56.792 --> 33:00.291
I saw you watching us.
We were just talking.

33:00.375 --> 33:02.750
I never thought anything else.

33:08.750 --> 33:10.625
Okay, I'll sign it.

33:10.709 --> 33:14.125
Well, what... At least read it first.

33:14.208 --> 33:16.375
I don't need to. I trust you.

33:26.583 --> 33:28.208
Oh, hi, Mike.

33:28.291 --> 33:30.750
So, tell me, I've been dying to know.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.083
Did you talk to Susan?

33:32.166 --> 33:34.625
Could she remember
what the movie was?

33:34.709 --> 33:37.000
Actually, no.

33:37.542 --> 33:40.041
Well, hang in there. We'll figure it out.

33:40.125 --> 33:42.792
It's just a matter of time
before everything starts coming back.

33:42.875 --> 33:44.542
Here, have a seat.

33:44.625 --> 33:47.583
Listen, you've been really helpful
the last few months,

33:47.667 --> 33:50.125
but I think I'm done here.

33:51.417 --> 33:55.083
Mike, I know this can be
a frustrating process,

33:55.166 --> 33:57.041
but if you give up now,

33:57.125 --> 34:00.709
there are so many memories
that could be lost to you.

34:02.333 --> 34:04.458
Yeah, I'm okay with that.

34:10.333 --> 34:13.041
Oh, my God. How many did you take?

34:13.125 --> 34:15.208
Sorry, I wanted options.

34:16.166 --> 34:18.667
Stop judging me,
I was hopped up on couture.

34:18.750 --> 34:21.500
Hey, you know, it's not funny.
Samantha called her lawyer.

34:21.583 --> 34:24.583
What? Over a dress?
God, what a bitch.

34:24.667 --> 34:27.583
Hey, don't call her that.

34:27.667 --> 34:30.000
She threatened me with mace
and then slugged you!

34:30.083 --> 34:31.208
Now you're on her side?

34:31.291 --> 34:34.583
Gabby, I didn't marry an angry woman.
I just divorced one.

34:34.667 --> 34:37.125
What happened? Did you have
some little mistress on the side?

34:37.208 --> 34:38.834
Worse.

34:38.917 --> 34:41.125
I treated her like she was the mistress.

34:41.208 --> 34:44.875
I set her up in a nice house.
I gave her an allowance.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.250
And then I came and went as I pleased.

34:49.959 --> 34:52.250
She was always there
when I needed her.

34:52.333 --> 34:55.125
But if she needed me, well...

34:57.291 --> 34:59.458
And if she wasn't happy,

34:59.542 --> 35:02.667
she could always go
and buy a nice new dress.

35:03.917 --> 35:07.583
You saw the closet,
so you know just how happy she was.

35:11.917 --> 35:13.125
What?

35:16.625 --> 35:18.917
I've known you for two weeks,

35:19.000 --> 35:23.166
and this is the first glimpse of a guy
I could actually like.

35:23.250 --> 35:26.333
A clueless,
emotionally stunted workaholic?

35:26.417 --> 35:29.000
A guy who can admit he screwed up.

35:29.083 --> 35:31.458
One who's not trying to impress me,
every second of the day,

35:31.542 --> 35:33.917
with how perfect and charming he is.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.208
I wouldn't mind
seeing more of that guy.

35:37.291 --> 35:39.500
Well, his schedule's wide open.

35:39.583 --> 35:42.667
- How about dinner tomorrow night?
- I'd love to.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.875
Although, what am I gonna wear now?

35:49.125 --> 35:52.500
Doesn't matter.
'Cause I'm just gonna talk you out of it.

35:53.875 --> 35:56.417
Look who's back. Mr Cocky.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.500
He never leaves for long,
does he, that guy?

36:11.041 --> 36:14.750
Are there any points
you'd like to discuss before you sign?

36:14.834 --> 36:18.500
I'd like you to say,
"We don't need this. We trust you."

36:20.500 --> 36:23.625
But you don't, so I'll sign it.

36:23.709 --> 36:28.333
And once I do, I'm going to earn
your trust by being a good wife to Ian.

36:28.417 --> 36:32.917
Well, we're sure you will be.
Sign all three copies, please.

36:37.375 --> 36:42.291
I mean it. I'm going to be loving
and faithful, and above all, honest.

36:42.375 --> 36:44.834
There'll be no secrets with Ian.

36:48.750 --> 36:50.834
I'll tell him everything.

36:51.917 --> 36:54.583
Well, we applaud your candour.

36:54.667 --> 37:00.083
What I'm trying to say is,
there'll be no topic that I need to skirt.

37:02.542 --> 37:06.458
No issue that I won't address.

37:09.792 --> 37:14.542
I won't conceal my true thoughts
under garments of secrecy.

37:17.041 --> 37:19.875
- Good for you. Now, if you'll just sign...
- Oh, for God's sake, Dahlia!

37:19.959 --> 37:22.000
Anyone can see
she's not a fortune hunter!

37:22.083 --> 37:24.500
Graham, what are you doing?
She is willing to sign!

37:24.583 --> 37:27.166
Which proves she can be trusted!

37:30.792 --> 37:33.583
I'm sure you'll be a good wife to Ian.

37:35.625 --> 37:37.500
You can count on it.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
Thanks for the flowers.

38:03.083 --> 38:05.291
You're welcome. Come inside.

38:06.917 --> 38:11.458
You know, about Travers,
you can see him if you want.

38:12.125 --> 38:14.458
- He misses you.
- I miss him, too.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.750
Oh, and just so you know,
he's at a sleepover.

38:16.834 --> 38:22.125
So I didn't leave him alone
with a six-pack and some matches.

38:22.792 --> 38:26.583
Look, Edie, what I said about you
the other day was...

38:26.667 --> 38:27.959
Dead on.

38:29.250 --> 38:31.291
You nailed me, Carlos.

38:31.375 --> 38:34.291
Maybe not the way
that I wanted you to, but still...

38:34.375 --> 38:36.750
But I had no right to judge you.

38:36.834 --> 38:41.250
Besides, the guys, the clothes,
the partying, that's you.

38:41.333 --> 38:43.959
I mean, that's the Edie that we love.

38:44.041 --> 38:46.792
Well, I'm glad you love her
because I'm getting pretty tired of her.

38:46.875 --> 38:49.750
- Oh, come on...
- I'm a 40-year-old party girl.

38:49.834 --> 38:53.250
Do you think that I don't know
that my days are numbered?

38:55.500 --> 38:57.125
I don't know
what you want me to say here.

38:57.208 --> 38:59.125
Don't say anything.

38:59.208 --> 39:03.417
Just stop seeing the person
that I've been

39:03.500 --> 39:06.333
and start seeing the person I could be.

39:07.542 --> 39:11.500
Look at me,
not the Edie that I show the world.

39:15.792 --> 39:19.375
In fact, let's lose her.

39:21.625 --> 39:24.834
Forget the blouse that she wears

39:24.917 --> 39:27.291
because she knows
it shows off her cleavage.

39:27.375 --> 39:29.542
Edie, what are you doing?

39:32.542 --> 39:35.917
And the skirt that's so short

39:36.000 --> 39:39.333
because she knows
that guys love long legs.

39:40.583 --> 39:42.375
And the heels,

39:43.834 --> 39:45.959
the ones that make her legs
look even longer.

39:46.041 --> 39:47.792
Edie, please.

39:47.875 --> 39:50.959
Forget the bra
that holds her breasts a little higher

39:51.041 --> 39:53.500
than they are on their own these days.

39:59.667 --> 40:01.417
And the panties,

40:03.792 --> 40:07.291
the ones that hide the scar
from my C-section.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.792
This is it.

40:21.458 --> 40:22.875
Hi, Carlos.

40:23.667 --> 40:25.041
I'm Edie.

40:27.625 --> 40:31.542
I might not be the woman that
you thought I was under all of that,

40:33.709 --> 40:35.333
but I'm real

40:37.000 --> 40:38.542
and I'm here.

40:42.291 --> 40:44.583
And I'm asking for a chance.

41:01.875 --> 41:03.375
Hey, Andrew.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.375
Oh, thanks. He's gonna be okay.

41:07.709 --> 41:11.709
No. No, absolutely not.
We will open tonight as usual.

41:13.375 --> 41:17.083
Hey, it's gonna be fine, Andrew.
I will take care of it.

41:17.959 --> 41:19.667
It's my job now.

41:20.959 --> 41:23.625
Okay. See you soon. Bye.

41:28.083 --> 41:32.250
<i>In every housewife's closet,</i>
<i>there's an article of clothing</i>

41:32.333 --> 41:36.667
<i>that tells you more about its owner</i>
<i>than she would want you to know.</i>

41:37.667 --> 41:43.083
<i>It might be a shirt that she despises</i>
<i>but wears without complaint.</i>

41:44.709 --> 41:46.834
<i>Perhaps it's some lingerie</i>

41:46.917 --> 41:52.041
<i>she knows isn't hers,</i>
<i>but refuses to discuss,</i>

41:54.792 --> 41:57.125
<i>or a dress she once loved</i>

41:58.709 --> 42:01.625
<i>that she can no longer bear to look at.</i>

42:04.208 --> 42:09.917
<i>Yes, you can learn a lot about women</i>
<i>from what they choose to wear.</i>

42:11.917 --> 42:16.125
<i>You can learn even more</i>
<i>by what they choose to take off,</i>

42:17.333 --> 42:20.625
<i>and who they take it off for.</i>
