00:39.590 --> 00:41.524
OKAY MOM.

00:42.026 --> 00:43.859
READY TO GO
HUNTING CARTMAN?

00:43.861 --> 00:46.329
MY UNCLE JIMBO SAYS WE GOTTA
GET UP THERE EARLY.

00:46.331 --> 00:47.630
RIGHT
UNCLE JIMBO?

00:47.632 --> 00:48.397
THAT'S RIGHT
STANLY.

00:48.399 --> 00:51.567
ANIMALS ARE MUCH EASIER
TO SHOOT IN THE MORNING.

00:51.569 --> 00:52.101
HERE HON,

00:52.103 --> 00:55.471
I PACKED YOU CHEESY POOFS
AND HAPPY TARTS.

00:55.473 --> 00:57.073
DON'T WORRY
MISS CARTMAN,

00:57.075 --> 00:58.174
WE'LL TAKE
GOOD CARE OF HIM.

00:58.176 --> 01:01.010
I BROUGHT MY OLD WAR BUDDY DAN
TO KEEP THINGS SAFE.

01:01.012 --> 01:04.714
( voice box )
HELLO MRS. CARTMAN,
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?

01:04.716 --> 01:06.882
BE SURE TO USE
LOTS OF BUG SPRAY,

01:06.884 --> 01:08.718
AND IF YOU HAVE
TO POO-POO

01:08.720 --> 01:11.520
DON'T WIPE
WITH POISON IVY.

01:11.522 --> 01:12.588
( laughing )

01:12.590 --> 01:13.656
DUDE,
THAT'S SICK MOM!

01:13.658 --> 01:16.726
I KNOW IT CAN GET SCARY
UP IN THOSE THOSE WOODS.

01:16.728 --> 01:18.661
BUT JUST REMEMBER,

01:18.663 --> 01:21.097
MOMMY'S NOT
FAR AWAY.

01:21.099 --> 01:22.331
( laughing )

01:22.333 --> 01:23.299
DRIVE, DRIVE!

01:23.301 --> 01:25.401
YOU GIVE YOUR
MOMMY A KISSY.

01:25.403 --> 01:28.104
DRIVE THE CAR, DAMMIT,
DRIVE!

01:28.973 --> 01:31.240
DON'T GET SCARED UP IN
THE MOUNTAINS, CARTMAN.

01:31.242 --> 01:33.309
SHUT UP, I'M NOT
SCARED OF NOTHING!

01:33.311 --> 01:36.712
MAYBE YOUR MOM CAN GIVE<i> ME</i>
A KISS TOO, CARTMAN.

01:36.714 --> 01:37.780
( mumbling )

01:37.782 --> 01:40.716
WHOA!
THAT'S DISGUSTING!

01:40.718 --> 01:42.985
YOU PIECE OF CRAP,
I'LL KILL YOU!

01:42.987 --> 01:44.520
THAT'S THE
SPIRIT BOYS!

01:44.522 --> 01:47.323
LET'S GET THAT
TESTOSTERONE FLOWING!

01:47.325 --> 01:48.524
NOW BOYS,

01:48.526 --> 01:50.593
I NEED TO GET SERIOUS
FOR A MINUTE.

01:50.595 --> 01:54.296
I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND
A FEW BASIC RULES OF HUNTING,

01:54.298 --> 01:55.698
SINCE THIS IS
YOUR FIRST TIME.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.134
FIRST OF ALL, DON'T EVER
WALK WITH YOUR GUN

01:58.136 --> 01:59.635
UNLESS THE
SAFETY IS ON.

01:59.637 --> 02:01.771
SECOND, DON'T SHOOT ANYTHING
THAT LOOKS HUMAN.

02:01.773 --> 02:04.840
AND THIRD, NEVER SPILL YOUR BEER
IN THE BULLET CHAMBER.

02:04.842 --> 02:07.610
( Stan )
UNCLE JIMBO,
WE DON'T DRINK BEER.

02:07.612 --> 02:08.210
YOU WHAT?!

02:08.212 --> 02:09.845
( voice box )
OH, YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

02:09.847 --> 02:12.448
I DON'T THINK
8-YEAR-OLD KIDS DRINK BEER.

02:12.450 --> 02:13.482
I LIKE
CHOCOLATE MILK!

02:13.484 --> 02:16.485
WE'LL BE DOING PLENTY
OF DRINKING ON<i> THIS</i> TRIP.

02:16.487 --> 02:19.655
AFTER ALL,
HUNTING SOBER IS LIKE...

02:19.657 --> 02:21.657
<i>FISHING...</i>
SOBER.

02:21.659 --> 02:25.494
IT SURE WILL BE NICE TO GET OUT
OF THE CITY FOR A WHILE.

02:25.496 --> 02:28.064
AWAY FROM
CIVILIZATION.

02:29.734 --> 02:32.902
WELL,
HERE WE ARE.

02:33.171 --> 02:36.138
OKAY, EACH OF YOU
YOUNG 'UN'S TAKE A GUN,

02:36.140 --> 02:38.374
A BEER
AND SOME SMOKES.

02:38.376 --> 02:41.544
HEY, I DIDN'T
GET A GUN!

02:42.680 --> 02:43.179
SWEET.

02:43.181 --> 02:44.947
THIS IS LIKE THE GUN
I USED IN 'NAM.

02:44.949 --> 02:46.382
YOU WEREN'T
IN VIETNAM CARTMAN.

02:46.384 --> 02:49.018
( voice box )
WERE YOU STATIONED
IN<i> DA NANG</i>?

02:49.020 --> 02:50.586
CARTMAN ALWAYS
MAKES STUFF UP.

02:50.588 --> 02:51.954
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
ANYTHING HE SAYS.

02:51.956 --> 02:53.856
HEY, I'LL BLOW
YOUR FREAKING HEAD OFF!

02:53.858 --> 02:56.158
LOOK OUT SON,
THAT'S DANGEROUS!

02:56.160 --> 02:58.828
YOU'RE GONNA
SPILL YOUR BEER.

03:03.234 --> 03:04.934
MY UNCLE JIMBO SAYS
THAT AFTER THIS

03:04.936 --> 03:06.769
HE'S GONNA TAKE ME
HUNTING IN AFRICA.

03:06.771 --> 03:08.237
WOW,
THAT'LL BE COOL!

03:08.239 --> 03:11.707
MY MOM SAYS THERE'S A LOT OF
BLACK PEOPLE IN AFRICA.

03:11.709 --> 03:13.142
BOYS,
LOOKIE THERE.

03:13.144 --> 03:15.211
THAT THERE IS A
ROCKY MOUNTAIN BLACK BEAR.

03:15.213 --> 03:17.913
ONE OF THE FEW REMAINING
OF ITS KIND.

03:17.915 --> 03:19.682
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

03:19.684 --> 03:22.852
MY GOD, IT'S COMING
RIGHT FOR US!

03:23.955 --> 03:26.355
HEY, IT WASN'T
COMING RIGHT FOR US.

03:26.357 --> 03:28.324
IT WAS JUST
SITTING THERE.

03:28.326 --> 03:29.525
SHH,
NOT SO LOUD.

03:29.527 --> 03:31.760
THAT THERE IS JUST
A TECHNICALITY.

03:31.762 --> 03:32.528
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN?

03:32.530 --> 03:35.331
YOU SEE, THE DEMOCRATS
HAVE PASSED A LOT OF LAWS

03:35.333 --> 03:37.066
TRYING TO STOP US
FROM HUNTING.

03:37.068 --> 03:38.234
DEMOCRATS
PISS ME OFF.

03:38.236 --> 03:40.469
THEY SAY WE CAN'T SHOOT
CERTAIN ANIMALS ANYMORE

03:40.471 --> 03:42.738
UNLESS THEY'RE POSING
AN IMMEDIATE THREAT.

03:42.740 --> 03:44.673
THEREFORE, BEFORE
WE SHOOT SOMETHING

03:44.675 --> 03:47.376
WE HAVE TO SAY
"IT'S COMING RIGHT FOR US".

03:47.378 --> 03:50.012
WOW, YOU'RE SMART
UNCLE JIMBO.

03:50.014 --> 03:51.547
JIMBO, LOOK.

03:51.549 --> 03:53.048
OH, IT'S A DEER.

03:53.050 --> 03:56.685
LOOKS LIKE ABOUT
A 46-GAUGE, NED.

03:56.921 --> 03:59.855
IT'S COMING
RIGHT FOR US!

04:03.094 --> 04:03.959
KICK ASS!

04:03.961 --> 04:05.394
DID YOU
SEE THAT?

04:05.396 --> 04:09.098
I WAS IMPALED BY THAT
FEROCIOUS CHARGING BUCK.

04:09.100 --> 04:12.568
RABBIT, RABBIT
FIVE O'CLOCK.

04:13.437 --> 04:15.337
LET'S MOVE!
MOVE!

04:15.339 --> 04:17.072
IS THIS HUNTING?

04:17.074 --> 04:17.840
I GUESS SO.

04:17.842 --> 04:21.177
DUDE, I'M STARTING
TO HAVE FLASHBACKS.

04:21.179 --> 04:21.544
WHAT?

04:21.546 --> 04:23.312
STAND FORTH,
PULL UP FLANK!

04:23.314 --> 04:26.515
LOOK OUT FOR CHARLIES
UP IN THE TREES!

04:29.086 --> 04:31.787
THIS ONE'S
YOURS STAN.

04:33.724 --> 04:35.591
IT'S COMING
RIGHT FOR US!

04:35.593 --> 04:38.227
IT'S COMING
RIGHT FOR US.

04:41.165 --> 04:42.464
SHOOT IT STAN.

04:42.466 --> 04:44.633
I GOT YOUR BACK
SOLDIER.

04:45.937 --> 04:46.769
I CAN'T.

04:46.771 --> 04:49.905
WHAT THE--
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

04:49.907 --> 04:51.707
I DON'T WANNA
SHOOT THE BUNNY.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.609
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT

04:53.611 --> 04:55.945
YOU'RE BABBLING,
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

04:55.947 --> 04:56.979
YOU'RE HYSTERICAL!

04:56.981 --> 04:58.013
I'M NOT
HYSTERICAL,

04:58.015 --> 04:59.248
I JUST DON'T WANNA
SHOOT THE BUNNY.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.750
NO NEPHEW OF MINE IS
GONNA BE A TREE-HUGGER!

05:01.752 --> 05:02.418
YEAH, HIPPIE!

05:02.420 --> 05:04.653
GO BACK TO WOODSTOCK
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT ANYTHING.

05:04.655 --> 05:06.121
I CAN SHOOT<i> YOU,</i>
FAT ASS!

05:06.123 --> 05:07.656
I CAN
SHOOT YOU TOO!

05:07.658 --> 05:08.290
I'LL KILL YOU!

05:08.292 --> 05:10.359
I'LL FILL YOU
FULL OF LEAD!

05:10.361 --> 05:11.260
( rumbling )

05:11.262 --> 05:13.495
HEY WHAT'S THAT?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.067
( humming )

05:21.339 --> 05:23.606
( rumbling sounds )

05:27.812 --> 05:30.946
WHAT THE HECK
IS THIS?

05:32.083 --> 05:34.216
YEAH FRANK?
IT'S RANDY.

05:34.218 --> 05:34.917
GOOD.

05:34.919 --> 05:38.220
YEAH, LISTEN,
THE LITTLE NEEDLE'S MOVING.

05:38.222 --> 05:41.123
IT'S GOING BACK AND FORTH
REALLY FAST.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.992
WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?

05:42.994 --> 05:44.093
UH-HUH.

05:44.095 --> 05:45.160
UH-HUH.

05:45.162 --> 05:47.162
LET ME CHECK.

05:47.498 --> 05:49.431
YEAH,
IT'S SMOKING.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.266
UH-HUH.

05:50.268 --> 05:52.101
OH, REALLY?

05:52.103 --> 05:53.969
REALLY?

05:55.606 --> 05:56.772
OH, MY GOD!

05:56.774 --> 05:58.807
A VOLCANO!

05:58.809 --> 06:01.543
( suspenseful music )

06:02.346 --> 06:04.046
( sipping )

06:04.048 --> 06:05.581
EHHHH.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.886
MY WEENIES
WON'T COOK.

06:10.888 --> 06:12.454
THIS WOOD
WON'T BURN.

06:12.456 --> 06:16.892
LOOKS LIKE WE'LL HAVE TO USE
THE OLD INDIAN FIRE TRICK.

06:16.894 --> 06:19.128
YEAH.

06:26.370 --> 06:27.670
( laughing )

06:27.972 --> 06:31.507
HEY STOP, DROP,

06:33.544 --> 06:34.176

06:34.178 --> 06:35.878
GODDAMNIT,
I JUST GOT THAT VAN.

06:35.880 --> 06:38.480
HOW THE HELL ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO GET HOME?

06:38.482 --> 06:41.150
OH, IT HURTS,
IT HURTS!

06:41.152 --> 06:42.318
HEY, YOU GUYS,

06:42.320 --> 06:45.187
THIS ONE'S PRETTY
GOOD RIGHT NOW.

06:46.090 --> 06:47.189
BUT YOU SEE
MR. MAYOR,

06:47.191 --> 06:51.160
YOU CAN'T STOP SERVING SALISBURY
STEAK IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

06:51.162 --> 06:53.262
WHAT'S NEXT,
MEAT LOAF?

06:53.264 --> 06:55.864
WE ARE QUITE AWARE
OF YOUR CONCERNS CHEF, BUT--

06:55.866 --> 06:58.267
( intercom )
Mayor, the geologist
is here to see you.

06:58.269 --> 07:00.102
MY GEOLOGIST...?
NOW?

07:00.104 --> 07:01.804
TELL HIM THE
INFECTION IS FINE

07:01.806 --> 07:03.706
AND I DON'T NEED
ANOTHER CHECK-UP.

07:03.708 --> 07:05.641
No Mayor, that's
a gynecologist,

07:05.643 --> 07:07.443
a geologist
studies the Earth.

07:07.445 --> 07:09.645
DON'T YOU THINK
I KNOW THAT?

07:09.647 --> 07:11.647
HOW DEAR YOU INSULT
MY INTELLECT!

07:11.649 --> 07:13.949
I WENT TO PRINCETON
FOR GODSAKE!

07:13.951 --> 07:15.484
YOU GET OUT
OF MY OFFICE!

07:15.486 --> 07:16.885
I'm not in
your office Mayor,

07:16.887 --> 07:19.555
I'm talking to you
through a speaker.

07:20.624 --> 07:23.125
JUST SEND IN
THE GEOMETRIST!

07:23.127 --> 07:23.826
Geologist.

07:23.828 --> 07:25.227
YOU ARE
FIRED, BUDDY!

07:25.229 --> 07:27.363
Thank you Mayor, it's been
great working for you.

07:27.365 --> 07:29.865
MAYOR, WE HAVE GOT
A VERY BIG PROBLEM.

07:29.867 --> 07:32.301
MT. EVANSON
IS ABOUT TO ERUPT.

07:32.303 --> 07:33.836
( suspense music )

07:33.838 --> 07:37.005
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
TO THE TOWN?

07:37.007 --> 07:40.442
THIS GRAPH SHOWS EVERYTHING
FROM "NORMAL" TO "BAD".

07:40.444 --> 07:43.479
RIGHT NOW SOUTH PARK
IS<i> HERE.</i>

07:43.481 --> 07:45.614
( suspense music )

07:54.191 --> 07:56.158
MY GOD!

07:56.160 --> 07:58.260
MAYOR, SOME OF
THE SCHOOL CHILDREN

07:58.262 --> 08:01.830
ARE UP CAMPING ON THAT
MOUNTAIN RIGHT NOW!

08:01.832 --> 08:02.931
THIS<i> IS</i> BIG.

08:02.933 --> 08:04.700
JOHNSON, JOHNSON,
ARE YOU THERE?!

08:04.702 --> 08:06.969
( intercom )
You just fired Johnson,
Mayor.

08:06.971 --> 08:08.103
I'm his
replacement, Ted.

08:08.105 --> 08:10.205
TED, WE HAVE GOT
A MAJOR CRISIS HERE!

08:10.207 --> 08:13.275
I WANT YOU TO GET ON THE PHONE
AND CALL "INSIDE EDITION",

08:13.277 --> 08:16.245
"RESCUE 911"
AND "ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT".

08:16.247 --> 08:18.414
YOU BETTER GET MY STYLIST
ON THE PHONE TOO.

08:18.416 --> 08:22.651
DON'T WORRY,
THINGS ARE UNDER CONTROL.

08:24.221 --> 08:27.022
AND THEN NED PICKED UP
THE GRENADE

08:27.024 --> 08:27.656
AND<i> BOOM</i>!

08:27.658 --> 08:29.191
BLASTED HIS
ARM CLEAR OFF!

08:29.193 --> 08:32.060
WE SPENT THREE HOURS LOOKING
FOR THAT DAMN ARM,

08:32.062 --> 08:33.362
BUT IT WAS
NEVER TO BE FOUND.

08:33.364 --> 08:37.232
SOME SAY IT'S STILL
CRAWLING AROUND TO THIS DAY.

08:38.002 --> 08:39.601
RAAHH...!

08:40.204 --> 08:41.103
GOTCHA!

08:41.105 --> 08:42.337
THAT'S NOT
SCARY.

08:42.339 --> 08:44.973
YOU WERE SCARED CARTMAN,
YOU ALMOST PEED YOUR PANTS.

08:44.975 --> 08:46.909
SHUT UP I DIDN'T
PEE MY PANTS!

08:46.911 --> 08:49.378
HEY NED,
HAND ME THAT GIN.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.881
YOU BOYS
WANNA TIE ONE ON?

08:52.883 --> 08:55.184
NO, THANKS, THAT STUFF
TASTES LIKE PEE.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.685
YEAH,
CARTMAN'S PEE.

08:56.687 --> 08:58.086
YOU<i> WOULD</i>
TASTE MY PEE!

08:58.088 --> 08:59.621
WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU?

08:59.623 --> 09:02.224
CAN'T YOU HAVE
A LITTLE ALCOHOL?

09:03.027 --> 09:06.261
CHRIST, LOOK AT THAT
LITTLE BASTARD GO!

09:07.498 --> 09:08.664
YOU SEE THAT STAN?

09:08.666 --> 09:11.200
NOW<i> THAT</i> IS A DIRTY
LITTLE BASTARD.

09:11.202 --> 09:13.602
HEY, I'M A DIRTY
LITTLE BASTARD TOO.

09:13.604 --> 09:16.004
HEY YOU GUYS,
I KNOW A SCARY STORY.

09:16.006 --> 09:18.640
SHUT UP CARTMAN,
YOU CAN'T SCARE<i> ANYBODY.</i>

09:18.642 --> 09:19.374
OH YEAH?

09:19.376 --> 09:23.779
HAVE YOU GUYS EVER
HEARD OF<i> SKUZZLE-BUTT</i>?

09:23.781 --> 09:24.713
WHAT BUTT?

09:24.715 --> 09:26.482
SKUZZLE-BUTT
IS A CREATURE

09:26.484 --> 09:28.450
THAT LIVES UP
ON THIS VERY MOUNTAIN

09:28.452 --> 09:32.588
AND KILLS ANYBODY
WHO CLIMBS TO THE TOP.

09:32.590 --> 09:33.121
WHY?

09:33.123 --> 09:35.457
BECAUSE IT LOVES
THE TASTE OF BLOOD

09:35.459 --> 09:39.261
AND LIKES TO ADD PIECES
TO ITS DEFORMED BODY.

09:39.263 --> 09:40.696
DEFORMED HOW?

09:40.698 --> 09:42.898
WELL, ON HIS LEFT ARM,

09:42.900 --> 09:45.133
INSTEAD OF A HAND,
HE HAS...

09:45.135 --> 09:46.235
A HOOK.

09:46.237 --> 09:46.869
A KNIFE.

09:46.871 --> 09:49.204
NO, A PIECE
OF CELERY.

09:49.206 --> 09:49.872
CELERY?

09:49.874 --> 09:51.840
YES, AND HE WALKS
WITH A LIMP

09:51.842 --> 09:54.109
BECAUSE ONE OF
HIS LEGS IS MISSING.

09:54.111 --> 09:56.211
AND WHERE HIS LEG
<i>SHOULD</i> BE

09:56.213 --> 09:59.348
THERE'S NOTHING BUT...
<i>PATRICK DUFFY.</i>

09:59.350 --> 10:00.849
PATRICK DUFFY?

10:00.851 --> 10:03.085
DAMNIT CARTMAN,
THAT'S NOT SCARY?

10:03.087 --> 10:04.086
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:04.088 --> 10:06.121
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
"STEP BY STEP"?

10:06.123 --> 10:08.123
SO HE LIVES ALONE
ON THIS MOUNTAIN

10:08.125 --> 10:11.360
AND WEAVES BASKETS
AND OTHER ASSORTED CRAFTS.

10:11.362 --> 10:13.028
THEY SAY THAT
ON QUIET NIGHTS

10:13.030 --> 10:15.898
YOU CAN HEAR HIM
WEAVING HIS BASKETS.

10:15.900 --> 10:18.567
( weaving sounds )

10:18.836 --> 10:21.403
CARTMAN, YOU SUCK AT
TELLING SCARY STORIES!

10:21.405 --> 10:23.438
YEAH GIVE ME
THAT FLASHLIGHT.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.007
( rumbling )

10:25.309 --> 10:26.341
WHAT IS THAT?

10:26.343 --> 10:29.645
MAYBE IT'S SKUZZLE-BUTT
COMING TO WEAVE US
INTO BASKETS.

10:29.647 --> 10:30.746
HEY,
IT MIGHT BE!

10:30.748 --> 10:34.449
GOSH, I HOPE HE DOESN'T CUT ME
WITH HIS CELERY HAND.

10:34.451 --> 10:36.051
SCREW YOU GUYS!

10:36.053 --> 10:37.586
GO TO HELL!

10:37.588 --> 10:40.989
NED, WHY DON'T YOU WHIP OUT
THE OLD CANCER KAZOO?

10:40.991 --> 10:43.292
LET'S DO
A LITTLE SONG.

10:43.627 --> 10:47.029
( voice box )
♪ COOMBAYA,

11:06.584 --> 11:07.482

11:07.484 --> 11:10.118

11:10.120 --> 11:11.553
LET'S SEE
HOW THEY LIKE IT

11:11.555 --> 11:13.689
WHEN THEY ACTUALLY
<i>SEE</i> SKUZZLE-BUTT.

11:13.691 --> 11:15.557

WHAT DUDE?

11:30.240 --> 11:31.873
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE CARTMAN IS.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.442
I THINK SOMETHING
TOOK HIM AWAY.

11:33.444 --> 11:35.143
WHERE'S MY UNCLE JIMBO
AND NED?

11:35.145 --> 11:37.079
THEY'RE OUT FISHING
WITH KENNY.

11:37.081 --> 11:39.514
BUT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
<i>MY</i> CAMPING TRIP.

11:39.516 --> 11:41.283
WHY DO THEY LIKE
KENNY SO MUCH?

11:41.285 --> 11:42.551
DOESN'T HE LIKE<i> ME</i>
ANYMORE?

11:42.553 --> 11:45.921
WELL STAN, YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

11:45.923 --> 11:46.755
WHAT?

11:46.757 --> 11:48.056
( farting )

11:49.193 --> 11:51.159
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MORNING
FOR FISHING.

11:51.161 --> 11:54.496
THERE'S ONE,
THERE'S A FISH RIGHT THERE!

11:56.800 --> 11:58.734
GOT IT.

12:00.904 --> 12:02.471
GREAT INSTINCTS BOY.

12:02.473 --> 12:04.806
UNCLE JIMBO,
CARTMAN'S MISSING!

12:04.808 --> 12:07.042
WHO?
THE FAT KID?

12:07.044 --> 12:07.576
YEAH.

12:07.578 --> 12:10.078
I GUESS WE BETTER
GO LOOK FOR HIM.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.114
NED, WE GOTTA
CUT IT SHORT.

12:12.116 --> 12:14.449
FIRE UP THE 12-20!

12:17.488 --> 12:20.188
WELL I THINK
THAT'S ABOUT THE LIMIT

12:20.190 --> 12:22.124
FOR<i> OUR</i>
FISHING PERMIT.

12:22.126 --> 12:25.527
IT SMELLS LIKE
DEAD FISH HERE.

12:25.529 --> 12:26.928
( mumbling )

12:26.930 --> 12:29.231
OH, MAN,
THAT IS NASTY.

12:29.233 --> 12:31.199
I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER SEEN

12:31.201 --> 12:33.735
A KID AS COOL
AS YOU KENNY.

12:33.737 --> 12:36.938
I'M MAKING YOU
MY HONORARY NEPHEW.

12:43.947 --> 12:46.348
BUT NOW A TICKING
TIME BOMB OF HOT LAVA

12:46.350 --> 12:47.516
WAITS TO
ENGULF THESE PEOPLE

12:47.518 --> 12:50.419
AND END THEIR MISERABLE LIVES
WITH ONE LAST FLEETING MOMENT

12:50.421 --> 12:52.988
OF EXCRUCIATINGLY
PAINFUL BURNING AGONY.

12:52.990 --> 12:55.924
HEY, I'M ON TV!
I'M ON TV!

12:55.926 --> 12:58.860
MAYOR, WHAT YOU DOING
TO PREPARE FOR THIS

12:58.862 --> 13:00.662
INEVITABLE
CATASTROPHE?

13:00.664 --> 13:02.264
ALL WE KNOW
RIGHT NOW

13:02.266 --> 13:03.832
IS THAT SOME OF
OUR CHILDREN

13:03.834 --> 13:06.501
ARE CAMPING ON
<i>THAT</i> MOUNTAIN--

13:06.503 --> 13:08.603
I'M SORRY,
CAN I START OVER?

13:08.605 --> 13:09.337
HUH?

13:09.339 --> 13:11.039
YOU CAN
EDIT THIS, RIGHT?

13:11.041 --> 13:13.041
READY,
THREE, TWO, ONE.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.476
ALL WE KNOW
RIGHT NOW

13:14.478 --> 13:18.213
IS SOME OF OUR CHILDREN ARE
UP CAMPING ON THAT MOUNTAIN.

13:18.215 --> 13:21.683
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING
UNTIL WE GET THEM!

13:21.685 --> 13:25.787
OKAY PEOPLE,
LET'S GO GET THOSE KIDS!

13:25.789 --> 13:29.691
C'MON EVERYBODY, YOU GOTTA
HELP THE CHILDREN.

13:31.962 --> 13:33.962
HE COULDN'T
HAVE GONE FAR...

13:33.964 --> 13:35.597
UNLESS SOMETHING
<i>DRUG</i> HIM OFF.

13:35.599 --> 13:38.467
THERE'S NOT MANY ANIMALS
OUT TODAY JIMBO.

13:38.469 --> 13:43.004
YEAH, IT'S ALMOST LIKE
SOMETHING FUNNY'S GOING ON.

13:43.006 --> 13:44.606
( rumbling )

13:44.708 --> 13:47.242
CHRIST NED, WHAT'D YOU
HAVE FOR BREAKFAST?

13:47.244 --> 13:50.245
I DON'T KNOW MAN,
I'VE GOT SOME BAD GAS.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.947
WAIT,
THERE'S A RAM!

13:51.949 --> 13:55.083
IT'S COMING
RIGHT FOR US!

13:55.085 --> 13:56.551
( gunshots )

13:57.321 --> 13:59.321
NICE SHOOTING,
KENNY.

13:59.323 --> 14:02.090
HERE, YOU NEED
A BIGGER GUN.

14:02.092 --> 14:02.557
LOOK!

14:02.559 --> 14:06.328
I AM SKUZZLE-BUTT,
LORD OF THE MOUNTAINS!

14:06.330 --> 14:09.297
BEHOLD MY
PATRICK DUFFY LEG!

14:09.299 --> 14:10.499
WHAT IS IT?

14:10.501 --> 14:11.967
DUDE, IT'S
SKUZZLE-BUTT!

14:11.969 --> 14:13.235
CARTMAN
WASN'T LYING.

14:13.237 --> 14:14.002
HOLY CROW!

14:14.004 --> 14:15.737
WE CAN MAKE A MINT
KILLING THIS THING.

14:15.739 --> 14:18.473
WE'LL BE ON THE COVER
OF "GUNS AND AMMO".

14:18.475 --> 14:21.743
THIS CALLS
FOR SOME HJ-14.

14:21.812 --> 14:24.880
THOSE GUYS
ARE TOTALLY SCARED.

14:24.882 --> 14:27.783
FIRE IN THE HOLE!

14:27.785 --> 14:30.185
HOLY CRAP!

14:32.156 --> 14:33.822
DAMN, I THINK
I MISSED.

14:33.824 --> 14:36.525
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?!

14:36.527 --> 14:38.927
C'MON, LET'S MOVE!
MOVE!

14:38.929 --> 14:40.529
WAIT, WAIT!

14:41.331 --> 14:42.697
IS IT ON?
OKAY.

14:42.699 --> 14:45.600
OKAY, PEOPLE, FORM GROUPS
AND SEARCH THE MOUNTAIN.

14:45.602 --> 14:48.670
REPORT BACK HERE EVERY HOUR,
YOU GOT THAT?

14:48.672 --> 14:50.839
MAYOR, I MIGHT
HAVE AN IDEA.

14:50.841 --> 14:51.807
OH, WHAT?

14:51.809 --> 14:54.042
IF WE CAN DIG
A VERY LARGE TRENCH

14:54.044 --> 14:56.378
WE CAN DIVERT THE LAVA
INTO A CANYON.

14:56.380 --> 14:58.580
THEN IT WOULD
BYPASS SOUTH PARK

14:58.582 --> 15:00.081
PRETTY MUCH
COMPLETELY.

15:00.083 --> 15:02.417
AND... THAT WOULD
BE GOOD, RIGHT?

15:02.419 --> 15:03.518
I'M PRETTY SURE.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.520
WELL, WHAT ARE
WE WAITING FOR?

15:05.522 --> 15:07.622
OKAY, PEOPLE,
CHANGE OF PLANS.

15:07.624 --> 15:09.991
HALF OF YOU
GRAB SHOVELS.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.726
THESE LOOK LIKE
HIS TRACKS.

15:11.728 --> 15:13.028
HE MUST'VE
GONE THIS WAY.

15:13.030 --> 15:14.896
NED, PREPARE
SOME HK-12.

15:14.898 --> 15:18.233
I'LL BET THAT SUCKER'S HEADED
FOR A HIGHER ELEVATION.

15:18.235 --> 15:20.402
THE HIGHER--
BIRD!

15:20.537 --> 15:23.638
THE HIGHER UP IT GOES
THE BETTER IT CAN BREATHE.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.941
LOOK,
UP THERE!

15:25.943 --> 15:28.944
YOU GUYS,
IT'S JUST ME!

15:28.946 --> 15:30.846
ARE WE SURE
IT'S SKUZZLE-BUTT?

15:30.848 --> 15:33.081
DOES IT HAVE PATRICK DUFFY
FOR A LEG?

15:33.083 --> 15:34.749
I CAN'T TELL,
LET'S KILL IT!

15:34.751 --> 15:37.919
I GOTTA GET OUT OF THIS
STUPID COSTUME!

15:37.921 --> 15:39.688
KENNY,
YOU TAKE THE FRONT.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.623
NO, I CAN DO IT,
UNCLE JIMBO.

15:41.625 --> 15:42.824
I WANNA
BAG THAT ANIMAL.

15:42.826 --> 15:44.860
THAT'S THE SPIRIT, KIDDO!
LET'S HUNT!

15:44.862 --> 15:46.461
YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS,
I WAS JUST KIDDING!

15:46.463 --> 15:49.364
( reporter )
AS SOME PEOPLE OF SOUTH PARK
TRY DESPERATELY

15:49.366 --> 15:50.732
TO SAVE
THEIR MOUNTAIN TOWN,

15:50.734 --> 15:52.400
OTHERS LOOK FOR
THE MISSING TOWNSPEOPLE.

15:52.402 --> 15:55.971
BUT ALL MUST TAKE
EVERY PRECAUTION NECESSARY.

15:55.973 --> 15:57.572
OKAY, PEOPLE,
LISTEN UP.

15:57.574 --> 15:59.608
AS WE NEAR THE TOP
OF THE MOUNTAIN

15:59.610 --> 16:03.178
THE CHANCES OF OUR ENCOUNTERING
SOME LAVA BECOMES GREAT.

16:03.180 --> 16:07.082
THEREFORE I HAVE SPECIAL
ORDERED THIS TRAINING FILM

16:07.084 --> 16:09.918
TO ASSIST US
IN VOLCANO SAFETY.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.321
MR. GARRISON,
IF YOU WOULD PLEASE.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.658
Harborers of sorrow,

16:16.660 --> 16:18.460
Natural disasters
can be the cause

16:18.462 --> 16:20.629
of troubling and
undesirable stress,

16:20.631 --> 16:22.497
and a volcano
is no exception.

16:22.499 --> 16:25.000
But what should you do
if a volcano erupts

16:25.002 --> 16:26.401
near you
or your family?

16:26.403 --> 16:29.571
Here we see the Stevens' family
enjoying a picnic,

16:29.573 --> 16:32.207
But suddenly daughter
hears a noise...

16:32.209 --> 16:33.408
It's a volcano.

16:33.410 --> 16:36.111
Junior seems worried,
but have no fear Junior,

16:36.113 --> 16:38.046
Jane learned in school
what to do

16:38.048 --> 16:40.448
when you hear
a volcano erupt.

16:40.617 --> 16:43.985
That's right, Jane,
duck and cover.

16:44.855 --> 16:50.258
So what will you do when
you hear a volcano erupting?

16:50.761 --> 16:53.328
That's right,
duck and cover.

16:53.330 --> 16:56.131
Looks like
you got the idea.

16:56.967 --> 16:59.801
Thank you
and goodbye.

16:59.803 --> 17:02.837
OKAY,
ANY QUESTIONS?

17:02.839 --> 17:04.039
THAT HAS
GOT TO BE

17:04.041 --> 17:06.408
THE MOST RIDICULOUS
LOAD OF PIG CRAP

17:06.410 --> 17:08.176
I HAVE<i> EVER</i> SEEN!

17:08.178 --> 17:09.878
THAT'S ENOUGH
OUT OF YOU!

17:09.880 --> 17:11.813
I'M GONNA BAG
SKUZZLE-BUTT,

17:11.815 --> 17:14.049
THEN WE'LL SEE
WHO'S A LITTLE BASTARD.

17:14.051 --> 17:17.485
( Cartman )
HEY SERIOUSLY,
YOU GUYS!

17:18.021 --> 17:20.188
KILL IT STAN,
KILL IT.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.329
C'MON, STAN,
KILL IT!

17:27.664 --> 17:29.564
GODDAMNIT,
I CAN'T DO IT!

17:29.566 --> 17:32.334
YOU PANSY,
GIVE ME THAT GUN!

17:32.970 --> 17:33.802
CARTMAN?

17:33.804 --> 17:35.670
GODDAMNIT,
DON'T SHOOT ME!

17:35.672 --> 17:37.005
WHAT THE
SAM HELL?

17:37.007 --> 17:38.740
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO SCARE YOU GUYS.

17:38.742 --> 17:40.508
YOU CAN PUT
THE GUNS DOWN NOW!

17:40.510 --> 17:43.211
SO MUCH FOR THE COVER
OF "GUNS AND AMMO".

17:43.213 --> 17:47.215
BUT I THINK WE'VE LEARNED
SOME IMPORTANT LESSONS.

17:47.217 --> 17:48.450
I THINK--

17:48.919 --> 17:50.352
( Stan )
WHOA!

17:50.354 --> 17:51.486
HOLY CRAP.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.656
THE MOUNTAIN,
ITS BLOWN ITS TOP!

17:58.195 --> 18:01.896
OH, MY GOD,
THEY KILLED KENNY!

18:02.132 --> 18:03.932
( mumbling )

18:06.103 --> 18:07.736
LOOK,
THE VOLCANO!

18:07.738 --> 18:10.071
WAIT,
DUCK AND COVER!

18:11.308 --> 18:12.807
( screaming )

18:12.809 --> 18:15.810
THAT LAVA'S COMING
RIGHT FOR US!

18:16.246 --> 18:18.646
OH, NO,
LOOK!

18:19.082 --> 18:22.017
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
TRENCH DOING HERE?!

18:22.019 --> 18:23.385
WE CAN'T
GET ACROSS!

18:23.387 --> 18:25.453
IT NOW LOOKS AS IF
THE MISSING CHILDREN

18:25.455 --> 18:27.555
ARE TRAPPED IN THE PATH
OF HOT NASTY LAVA.

18:27.557 --> 18:31.359
GOD, PLEASE DELIVER THOSE
DARLING KIDS FROM--

18:31.361 --> 18:34.629
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
THREE, TWO, AND ONE.

18:34.631 --> 18:37.532
GOD, PLEASE DELIVER...

18:37.534 --> 18:39.067
HELP!
