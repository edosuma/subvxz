00:14.993 --> 00:16.984
A little lower, Geoffrey.

00:20.899 --> 00:22.196
Geoffrey?

00:22.935 --> 00:24.732
Oh, hi, honey. It's you!

00:26.805 --> 00:30.070
The kids aren't back from the airport
with Will yet.

00:31.043 --> 00:33.136
In that case, I have an idea.

00:33.812 --> 00:35.803
Take no prisoners, Daddy.

00:39.551 --> 00:42.520
Speaking of prisoners,
let's talk about Will.

00:43.422 --> 00:45.822
You know, maybe Bel-Air Prep isn't
the right place for the boy.

00:45.891 --> 00:49.292
Maybe he could get more from
a different environment.

00:49.861 --> 00:52.728
So could we.
Come on, I'll race you to the Jacuzzi.

00:53.298 --> 00:54.959
Wait a minute, now. I found a school...

00:55.033 --> 00:58.127
that's a little further away
than we're used to.

00:58.470 --> 01:00.097
How much further?

01:00.272 --> 01:01.432
Switzerland.

01:02.874 --> 01:05.274
Now that that's settled,
I'll go fire up the Jacuzzi.

01:05.343 --> 01:06.709
Back it up.

01:07.045 --> 01:10.742
Philip, how could you even suggest
shipping Will off to some boarding school?

01:10.816 --> 01:14.081
Okay, I'm sorry, you're absolutely right.

01:14.152 --> 01:17.315
Will's a great kid,
I've even grown to sort of...

01:17.422 --> 01:20.516
Anyway, I'm sorry
I even mentioned Switzerland.

01:20.726 --> 01:21.852
Okay.

01:22.027 --> 01:23.961
- Y ou're forgiven.
- Thank you.

01:25.364 --> 01:27.764
Would you consider Great Britain?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.366
Well, a man can dream, can't he?

01:30.736 --> 01:33.227
Vivian, I'm sorry.
It's just that it's been so peaceful here...

01:33.305 --> 01:34.738
since Will's been in Philly.

01:34.806 --> 01:37.331
And, boarding school's not so bad,
is it, Geoffrey?

01:37.409 --> 01:39.400
Geoffrey went to boarding school.
Tell her, Geoffrey.

01:39.478 --> 01:41.878
Madam, I went to boarding school.

01:46.652 --> 01:48.779
And then I went to therapy.

01:50.989 --> 01:52.547
Who asked you? Get my lunch.

01:52.624 --> 01:54.216
Right away, sir.

01:55.093 --> 01:57.084
The man has a tapeworm.

02:02.100 --> 02:05.126
Philip, when Will gets here, please be nice.

02:05.404 --> 02:08.372
Otherwise, you're going to be bunking
with Mr. Couch.

02:11.677 --> 02:13.042
Woman, please...

02:14.546 --> 02:17.743
do you think that you can manipulate me
with sex?

02:19.885 --> 02:22.080
Does James Brown have a perm?

02:32.731 --> 02:37.327
Oh, Lord, I don't know whether to dive
under the table or do the running man.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.195
- G!
- Master William!

03:13.972 --> 03:15.337
Uncle Fink.

03:19.778 --> 03:22.338
Will, it's so nice to have you home.

04:34.886 --> 04:36.114
Uncle Phil, you look great, man.

04:36.188 --> 04:39.055
Y ou look like you lost some... hair.

04:41.393 --> 04:45.159
Looks like the whole Jackson family
could live in those pants.

04:45.831 --> 04:48.322
Daddy, that's how all the brothers
are dressing in Philly.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.028
No wonder Willy Williams moved to LA.

04:52.504 --> 04:54.665
Carlton, honey, what happened?

04:54.739 --> 04:58.505
Will told everyone at the airport
I was Bryant Gumbel.

05:03.381 --> 05:06.578
I thought I'd get my luggage faster.

05:06.751 --> 05:09.686
Y ou poor baby, what did they do?
Mob you for autographs?

05:09.754 --> 05:13.383
No, five old ladies attacked me
for being mean to Willard.

05:14.759 --> 05:16.659
Hey, it was worth it. We got the luggage.

05:16.728 --> 05:18.059
My sister.

05:18.797 --> 05:21.288
Daddy, I need $500.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.629
- Will!
- Hil!

05:26.738 --> 05:29.263
Daddy, I need $500.

05:30.642 --> 05:34.305
Hil, you should really consider
expanding your vocabulary a little.

05:34.379 --> 05:37.314
Hilary, honey, if it's for the barbecue
we're catering this afternoon...

05:37.382 --> 05:38.576
we have already paid you.

05:38.650 --> 05:42.416
It's not for the barbecue. I just want $500.

05:43.154 --> 05:46.214
Come on, Hil, please,
at least kiss him first.

05:51.963 --> 05:53.430
What is that?

05:53.565 --> 05:55.692
That would be Aisha.

05:55.767 --> 05:56.995
Oh, no.

05:57.302 --> 06:01.671
Y ou're right, Uncle Phil, wrong area code.
That would be Stacy.

06:01.973 --> 06:04.271
Vivian, tell me that's not a beeper.

06:04.976 --> 06:06.534
Can I have one, Daddy?

06:06.611 --> 06:08.841
When Jesse Jackson gets a job.

06:10.315 --> 06:13.842
Will, there'll be no beepers worn
in this house.

06:13.952 --> 06:16.147
Y o, what's up, Uncle Phil?
My mom let me wear it in Philly.

06:16.221 --> 06:18.121
That's because she's your mother
and she loves you.

06:18.189 --> 06:21.056
I'm your uncle. I just try not to hurt you.

06:22.560 --> 06:26.121
Come on, Uncle Phil,
I need to keep in touch with my tasties.

06:26.965 --> 06:28.262
I beg your pardon?

06:28.333 --> 06:30.164
His tasties, Daddy.

06:30.435 --> 06:33.802
Y ou know, his chubbies,
his slimmies, his old ladies?

06:34.940 --> 06:36.567
And, who are you?

06:37.342 --> 06:38.832
Queen Latifah?

06:43.448 --> 06:44.938
See, look...

06:45.083 --> 06:47.608
Just think of it as honeys on my hip,
Uncle Phil, you know?

06:47.686 --> 06:50.655
It's like I need to keep in touch with
my squaws, right?

06:50.722 --> 06:53.816
See otherwise, you know, they get all
frazzled and frantic and everything.

06:53.892 --> 06:56.622
- Y ou know how it is, right, Uncle Phil?
- No, I do not.

06:56.695 --> 07:00.791
That's because you only got one squaw
and you all never go nowhere.

07:01.566 --> 07:05.627
Well, this one squaw says take your
behind upstairs, change, and no beeper.

07:05.704 --> 07:08.673
And, Philip, how come
we don't ever go nowhere?

07:09.274 --> 07:10.741
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

07:10.809 --> 07:13.505
What about my freedom
to express myself?

07:13.912 --> 07:15.436
Will, back off.

07:15.580 --> 07:19.016
The big, fat vein in Daddy's head
is starting to throb.

07:19.651 --> 07:22.085
Y eah, and he hasn't given me
my money yet.

07:22.153 --> 07:23.745
No, come on, Hil, we cool. Y ou know...

07:23.822 --> 07:27.553
it ain't really serious
till his right eye start twitching.

07:30.996 --> 07:32.554
Okay, posse up.

07:37.302 --> 07:39.566
And may I say
that if you go with our firm...

07:39.637 --> 07:41.571
it'll be the best decision you ever made.

07:41.639 --> 07:43.664
Well, enough business talk,
Mr. And Mrs. Cornfeld.

07:43.742 --> 07:44.970
Please, enjoy the party.

07:45.043 --> 07:46.806
- Thank you. Call me Norma.
- Norma.

07:46.878 --> 07:49.039
And, you can call me Whitey.

07:50.081 --> 07:51.514
I think not.

07:51.950 --> 07:54.783
<i>E</i> veryone does,
on account of my white hair.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.878
White hair.

07:59.057 --> 08:01.252
Hello. Welcome to our home.

08:01.326 --> 08:03.123
I'm Vivian, Philip's wife.

08:03.928 --> 08:05.896
Vivian, say hi to Whitey.

08:08.099 --> 08:09.623
Hello, Whitey.

08:11.569 --> 08:14.197
Philip, why am I calling that man Whitey?

08:14.272 --> 08:15.967
Y o, yo, yo...

08:16.041 --> 08:17.338
Mommy...

08:17.409 --> 08:18.467
and Daddy.

08:19.944 --> 08:21.912
Oh, look. It's the entertainment.

08:25.316 --> 08:27.876
I think this is
our youngest daughter, Ashley.

08:27.952 --> 08:30.284
She just had a brain operation.

08:31.322 --> 08:34.222
Her head's a little swollen, hence the hat.

08:36.528 --> 08:38.188
Very good, honey.

08:41.099 --> 08:42.929
Ashley, what are you wearing?

08:43.001 --> 08:45.629
Will got it for me in Philly. Ain't it fly?

08:45.703 --> 08:48.672
- Switzerland, Vivian.
- Not far enough, Philip.

08:49.207 --> 08:51.198
Ashley, go upstairs and change right now.

08:51.276 --> 08:54.575
But, I like it. And if I don't wear it,
it'll hurt Will's feelings.

08:54.646 --> 08:57.581
If you do wear it, you'll never see 18.

08:57.749 --> 08:59.774
I never liked Will, anyway.

09:01.886 --> 09:03.285
Will, you must change.

09:03.354 --> 09:05.288
Carlton, you must grow.

09:06.424 --> 09:08.949
Will, you better change
before Dad sees you.

09:09.027 --> 09:11.018
What are you talking about, man?
I'm making a statement.

09:11.096 --> 09:13.496
What statement? "I'm out on parole"?

09:14.532 --> 09:16.466
Will, get away from the buffet table.

09:16.534 --> 09:19.025
Y our jail suit is scaring the people away.

09:19.471 --> 09:23.237
With all due respect, Hilary,
it's not Will's fault, it's...

09:23.741 --> 09:25.572
How shall I put this?

09:26.411 --> 09:27.935
The food sucks.

09:29.481 --> 09:32.575
Man, what are you talking about?
It looks good to me.

09:34.819 --> 09:36.582
The pepper's moving.

09:39.491 --> 09:43.222
That is the last time I buy sushi
out of the trunk of a car.

09:45.897 --> 09:47.262
Tuna roll?

09:49.067 --> 09:51.297
Will, take off those clothes.

09:52.036 --> 09:56.029
I would, Aunt Viv, but I wouldn't
want to make all your guests jealous.

09:56.474 --> 09:58.533
Will, please,
these are very important clients.

09:58.610 --> 10:00.771
At least take off that ridiculous hat.

10:06.050 --> 10:09.781
Wonderful party, Banks.
Y ou really know how to court a client.

10:09.854 --> 10:11.082
Thank you.

10:14.526 --> 10:16.494
This is my nephew, Will.

10:16.561 --> 10:18.756
And this is his hair.

10:19.998 --> 10:22.398
It's a pleasure to meet you both.

10:22.867 --> 10:24.391
Call me Whitey.

10:28.173 --> 10:29.834
No, I'm gonna call you that...

10:29.908 --> 10:33.173
then you gonna call me the other thing,
and we're gonna be here fighting.

10:35.547 --> 10:39.005
Will, Whitey is the president
of a very prestigious savings and loan.

10:39.250 --> 10:40.376
Oh, really?

10:40.451 --> 10:44.012
Guess a lot of your buddies
wearing suits like this now, huh?

10:49.794 --> 10:52.456
Why don't we just go over here, and...

10:52.931 --> 10:54.990
Move it over here, Whitey.

10:59.904 --> 11:01.929
- Y ou all right, Uncle Phil?
- Will...

11:02.073 --> 11:05.133
you just insulted a potential...
Put your hat on.

11:05.210 --> 11:08.145
- Y ou just told me to take my hat off.
- Put it on!

11:11.983 --> 11:15.077
That's me. Chill, fellas.
I got that right here.

11:18.489 --> 11:20.855
That's Stacy again, sweating me.

11:23.528 --> 11:25.553
Y ou want to handle this one,
big guy, or shall I?

11:25.630 --> 11:27.860
- Shut up, Carlton.
- Good call.

11:31.169 --> 11:34.570
Will, I told you there will be
no beepers worn in my house.

11:35.540 --> 11:38.100
Well, I didn't really disobey you,
Uncle Phil, 'cause, see...

11:38.176 --> 11:40.235
technically, we not in the house.

11:40.411 --> 11:41.537
Smog.

11:41.679 --> 11:42.771
Get rid of that thing.

11:42.847 --> 11:44.041
Come on, Uncle Phil, what's wrong?

11:44.115 --> 11:46.379
Do you think everybody's gonna think
I'm a drug dealer?

11:46.451 --> 11:48.146
Why wouldn't they think I'm a doctor?

11:48.219 --> 11:52.053
'Cause everyone knows
Buckwheat never went to medical school.

11:55.126 --> 11:57.151
Will, put your hat back on.

11:57.228 --> 11:58.820
I'm so confused.

11:59.731 --> 12:01.426
Well, let me clarify it for you, Will.

12:01.499 --> 12:05.128
Get rid of the hair, get rid of the clothes,
and give me the beeper.

12:05.203 --> 12:07.865
I don't really think
that Stacy's your type, Uncle Phil.

12:07.939 --> 12:10.464
Do you think that just because
there are a lot of people around...

12:10.541 --> 12:13.066
you can defy me openly
and get away with it?

12:13.211 --> 12:16.044
- Well, I was kind of hoping, since...
- Get upstairs!

12:16.114 --> 12:19.106
Uncle Phil, man, why you making
such a big deal about this?

12:19.183 --> 12:22.949
Boy, as long as you live in my house,
you will do what I say.

12:25.023 --> 12:27.218
Maybe I won't be in your house, then.

12:27.292 --> 12:28.418
Good.

12:29.060 --> 12:30.789
- Well, all right.
- Y eah.

12:32.797 --> 12:35.231
- Well, I'm out of here, then.
- Bye.

12:44.175 --> 12:46.700
And what are you looking at, Whitey?

12:56.721 --> 12:59.087
I'll help you with those, ma'am.

12:59.157 --> 13:01.091
No you won't, worm head.

13:03.461 --> 13:06.430
And there's more where that come from,
chump.

13:17.809 --> 13:19.333
What's up, man?

13:19.444 --> 13:21.810
- What's up, J?
- When did you get back?

13:21.946 --> 13:23.208
I just got back this morning, man.

13:23.281 --> 13:25.909
Man, welcome home. Later.

13:26.451 --> 13:29.545
Jazz! Jazz!

13:31.923 --> 13:33.550
Weren't you just here?

13:33.624 --> 13:36.957
I've been gone all summer. Isn't there
something else you'd like to say to me?

13:37.028 --> 13:38.962
Now that you mention it, yeah.

13:39.130 --> 13:41.257
Y ou dating Whoopi Goldberg?

13:42.166 --> 13:44.157
How about "come in," man?
I need a place to crash.

13:44.235 --> 13:46.396
Whoa. Y ou got a place to crash.

13:46.637 --> 13:48.969
A mansion with a pool, a tennis court...

13:49.040 --> 13:52.066
and a toilet that flushes
without using a coat hanger.

13:53.177 --> 13:54.769
Not no more, man.

13:54.846 --> 13:56.939
Dang, your toilet broke, too?

13:57.849 --> 14:00.079
No, Jazz, it's my uncle, man.
He kicking me all this static.

14:00.151 --> 14:02.585
I told him, "y ou can't accept me for me,
I'm out of here."

14:02.653 --> 14:04.678
I'm with you, my brother.

14:05.356 --> 14:07.153
So, I can stay with you?

14:07.225 --> 14:09.318
No. I already have company.

14:09.894 --> 14:11.361
What company?

14:11.662 --> 14:13.425
Company with breasts.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.535
Look, Jazz, can you ask them
to come back another time, please?

14:18.603 --> 14:21.504
Jazz, I'm getting Ionely.

14:22.907 --> 14:24.465
They're Ionely.

14:25.443 --> 14:28.571
Jazz, if you don't let me stay here,
I'm going to be out on the street, man.

14:28.646 --> 14:29.635
Jazz...

14:31.516 --> 14:32.676
Sorry, my brother...

14:32.750 --> 14:36.743
but those are the harsh realities
of the cruel world in which we habitate.

14:37.989 --> 14:39.957
And now, booty awaits me.

14:45.229 --> 14:48.824
Jazz, if our friendship means anything
to you, you'll open this door right now.

14:49.233 --> 14:53.499
I walked 10 miles and took four buses
to get here, now open this door.

14:56.274 --> 14:58.037
That's more like it.

15:04.115 --> 15:07.243
Don't tell me I can't stay at your crib.
We supposed to be boys.

15:07.318 --> 15:10.116
Y ou got some girl up in there, you won't...

15:11.088 --> 15:12.646
What's up, man?

15:13.391 --> 15:16.326
Dang, I thought I was having
a bad hair day.

15:19.397 --> 15:20.557
Y ou going bald, man.

15:20.631 --> 15:23.532
Y ou about to look like my uncle
in a minute.

15:23.701 --> 15:25.362
I never had a dog, man, so...

15:25.436 --> 15:28.064
you know, we going to swing out
for a little bit, all right?

15:28.139 --> 15:30.369
Y ou're the only friend I got, man.

15:33.511 --> 15:36.378
This is a black thing, right?
Y ou're going to pee on my foot.

15:36.447 --> 15:39.439
All right, you got that. Damn!

15:40.618 --> 15:43.052
<i>You are too c/ose to the vehic/e.</i>

15:43.521 --> 15:44.681
Who said that?

15:44.755 --> 15:47.155
<i>You are too c/ose to the vehic/e.</i>

15:47.225 --> 15:49.318
I heard you the first time.

15:49.527 --> 15:53.623
<i>You have 10 seconds to move away</i>
<i>before the a/arm activates.</i>

15:55.266 --> 15:56.790
Oh, really now?

16:04.542 --> 16:07.272
Ten seconds, I knew you was full of it.

16:08.179 --> 16:09.669
Chill, chill!

16:12.116 --> 16:14.084
Who are you talking to, son?

16:15.520 --> 16:18.489
Actually, I was talking to the car, Officer.

16:18.689 --> 16:20.350
Oh, the car talks?

16:20.958 --> 16:23.825
No, it's kind of fly, actually. Check it out.

16:25.429 --> 16:27.454
No, no, chill, no, watch.

16:30.902 --> 16:34.235
No, no, wait, wait, hold it.
Check it out, check it out.

16:34.472 --> 16:38.340
The car, it say, "move or I'll kill you,"
or something like that.

16:44.081 --> 16:46.447
Guess the cat's got its tongue.

16:49.487 --> 16:50.579
Damn!

16:56.227 --> 16:58.661
<i>You are too c/ose to the vehic/e.</i>

17:04.635 --> 17:06.465
Philip, Will's been gone
for seven hours now.

17:06.537 --> 17:08.095
What if something's happened to him?

17:08.172 --> 17:10.606
Don't try to cheer me up, Vivian.

17:11.342 --> 17:13.037
Philip, I'm serious. Do something.

17:13.109 --> 17:16.409
What do you want me to do?
I've got Geoffrey out scouring the city.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.743
I'm terribly sorry, sir,
I've looked everywhere.

17:18.816 --> 17:22.115
There isn't an ice cream sandwich
left in this town.

17:24.088 --> 17:26.454
Vivian.

17:27.892 --> 17:29.450
Ashley, what are you doing out of bed?

17:29.527 --> 17:30.755
I'm worried about Will.

17:30.828 --> 17:32.625
Why did you throw him out
into the street, Daddy?

17:32.697 --> 17:34.324
I did not throw him into the street.

17:34.398 --> 17:36.798
Quite right, sir.
Y ou threw him on the lawn.

17:36.867 --> 17:38.892
He rolled into the street.

17:42.006 --> 17:44.406
Daddy, we couldn't find Will anywhere.

17:44.475 --> 17:47.000
And, sorry, no ice cream sandwiches.

17:49.547 --> 17:52.414
Looks like you really blew it this time,
huh, big guy?

17:53.117 --> 17:55.950
I just hope the Willster's still breathing.

18:00.758 --> 18:03.784
Will! Oh, honey, thank God you're safe.

18:03.861 --> 18:05.192
Hi, Aunt Viv.

18:05.262 --> 18:06.627
Y ou stink.

18:07.331 --> 18:09.356
Boy, it's good to be home.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.793
Is there a problem, Officer?

18:12.303 --> 18:15.431
Oh, right. Just 'cause I come in the crib
in the middle of the night...

18:15.506 --> 18:18.566
escorted by a police officer,
you think something's wrong.

18:18.643 --> 18:20.702
See how he be trying to play me, Fred?

18:20.778 --> 18:23.941
Thank you so much for bringing
him home, Officer.

18:24.815 --> 18:27.443
Well, Will, I guess I better beat it.

18:30.688 --> 18:32.952
- Good night, folks.
- Good night.

18:37.328 --> 18:39.091
What, I got a boogie?

18:41.699 --> 18:43.633
Will, I am very disappointed in you.

18:43.701 --> 18:45.794
I can't believe the trouble
you've caused this family.

18:45.870 --> 18:48.771
Y our aunt's right.
Y ou've been back from Philly one day...

18:48.839 --> 18:51.865
you insult a client and you storm out
of this house like a crazy man...

18:51.942 --> 18:53.569
and worry this family half to death.

18:53.644 --> 18:56.579
And I don't appreciate the influence
you're having on your cousin Ashley.

18:56.647 --> 18:59.138
He's not a bad influence on me, Daddy.

18:59.216 --> 19:01.184
I have a mind of my own.

19:02.486 --> 19:04.477
If that's okay with you.

19:07.391 --> 19:09.154
Look at that.
It's like you got her brainwashed.

19:09.226 --> 19:12.559
That's right,
and it took me 13 years to do it.

19:12.897 --> 19:14.831
- Dad, can I say something?
- What is it, Carlton?

19:14.899 --> 19:17.629
Y ou forgot the part
about Will getting arrested.

19:18.235 --> 19:20.726
Y ou all trying to play me like that, right?

19:21.105 --> 19:24.700
What if he told you
that you couldn't wear plaid anymore?

19:25.710 --> 19:27.871
Don't joke about that, Will.

19:29.847 --> 19:34.443
What if he told you that you couldn't
entertain men in the Jacuzzi anymore?

19:34.652 --> 19:37.086
When did you have a man in the Jacuzzi?

19:37.421 --> 19:40.015
This isn't about me. It's about Will.

19:42.793 --> 19:44.988
Come on y'all. It's about all of us.

19:45.129 --> 19:46.892
I mean, look, we're young adults here.

19:46.964 --> 19:48.955
I mean, we have a right
to our own opinions.

19:49.033 --> 19:50.022
Y eah!

19:55.473 --> 19:59.102
Look, today it's my beeper, tomorrow
it's going to be who you can date...

19:59.176 --> 20:02.407
or how to vote, or what college to go to.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.414
That's such bulldoody.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.479
Dad knows I'm going to y ale.

20:07.551 --> 20:08.779
Y ou're going to Princeton.

20:08.853 --> 20:11.219
I don't want to go to Princeton.

20:12.757 --> 20:14.349
Hold on a minute.

20:14.425 --> 20:17.485
I want to know when you had a man
in the Jacuzzi.

20:17.561 --> 20:18.755
Look, that's my private life.

20:18.829 --> 20:21.992
That's between me, that man,
and his video camera.

20:27.371 --> 20:28.395
Look...

20:28.472 --> 20:30.440
Uncle Phil, I'm saying,
what's the difference...

20:30.508 --> 20:32.703
between me wearing this,
and you in the sixties?

20:32.777 --> 20:35.075
Y ou wore a dashiki and an afro.

20:36.614 --> 20:38.605
But I was making a cultural statement.

20:38.682 --> 20:41.150
Y ou're just drawing attention to yourself.

20:41.218 --> 20:43.448
But, now correct me if I'm wrong...

20:43.587 --> 20:47.318
but you don't think a 6'3",
250-pound black dude...

20:47.792 --> 20:48.986
in a dashiki...

20:49.059 --> 20:53.120
and an afro the size of West Philly
is drawing attention to himself?

20:53.864 --> 20:57.231
I am just trying to save you
from going through the same hassles...

20:57.301 --> 20:58.791
that I went through.

20:58.969 --> 21:03.235
But I'm saying, why would you want to?
Look how good you turned out.

21:03.307 --> 21:04.535
Y eah, Daddy.

21:04.642 --> 21:06.803
He's got you there, big guy.

21:08.212 --> 21:09.941
I'm with Will, Dad.

21:15.419 --> 21:16.681
Good.

21:17.755 --> 21:18.949
Well, Will...

21:19.957 --> 21:22.824
I hate to admit it,
but I guess you have a point.

21:23.894 --> 21:24.986
I do?

21:25.129 --> 21:28.690
Just because you live in my house
doesn't mean I can control you.

21:29.033 --> 21:30.193
It don't?

21:30.267 --> 21:33.361
So, you can express yourself
any way you want to.

21:33.504 --> 21:36.667
Keep the clothes,
keep the hair and the beeper.

21:37.975 --> 21:39.499
Knock yourself out.

21:40.978 --> 21:42.605
All right.

21:43.314 --> 21:44.508
But, you know...

21:44.582 --> 21:46.914
Now, I've been thinking.
Y ou know, I have...

21:46.984 --> 21:48.611
a need to...

21:48.686 --> 21:50.483
express myself, too.

21:52.089 --> 21:56.458
I don't know, Uncle Phil, you might be able
to get one little twist right here...

21:59.330 --> 22:02.197
No, no, no, that's not quite
what I had in mind.

22:02.366 --> 22:06.268
Y ou see, I can't force you to do
anything you don't want to do.

22:07.538 --> 22:09.096
But, these...

22:09.173 --> 22:10.902
are my kids.

22:12.676 --> 22:15.668
So, as long as you keep the hair...

22:15.880 --> 22:17.745
the clothes and the beeper...

22:18.382 --> 22:20.213
you're all grounded.

22:23.220 --> 22:24.551
Good night.

22:30.527 --> 22:31.789
Nice try.

22:35.499 --> 22:38.866
All right, look y'all, this is a classic case
of divide and conquer.

22:38.936 --> 22:40.870
Look, Malcolm warned us about this.

22:40.938 --> 22:42.166
Get him!

22:47.912 --> 22:49.903
We're going to swing out
for a little while, all right?

22:49.980 --> 22:53.006
'Cause you're the only friend I got
right now.

22:53.918 --> 22:56.045
Lift! Lift!

22:58.555 --> 22:59.544
Lift!

23:00.691 --> 23:02.522
Lift! Lift!
