00:00.960 --> 00:02.839
[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:02.923 --> 00:04.593
[Janine] Did you find out
anything about Caleb?

00:04.676 --> 00:07.431
[June] His family was
transferred to California.

00:07.473 --> 00:08.391
[Janine] He lives on the beach?

00:08.475 --> 00:10.897
Yeah. He lives on the beach.

00:10.980 --> 00:12.984
‐[applause]
‐[Moira] Thank you for speaking.

00:13.068 --> 00:15.030
Well, Luke asked me,
so I couldn't say no.

00:15.113 --> 00:16.324
Sure you could.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.036
"Free" means
you're free to say no.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.330
[June] Alma.

00:19.413 --> 00:20.332
We are not free.

00:20.415 --> 00:21.752
[Alma] Maybe this is as free
as we're gonna get.

00:21.835 --> 00:23.421
Maybe we should make
the best of it.

00:23.506 --> 00:26.010
She's been captured.
That's confirmed.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.764
[grunts]

00:27.847 --> 00:30.269
You wicked, wicked girl.

00:30.352 --> 00:32.691
Nichole is not your daughter.

00:32.774 --> 00:35.572
And if you think
I'm gonna let you have her

00:35.655 --> 00:38.034
and walk free,
you are delusional.

00:38.118 --> 00:39.453
I need to separate
my interests from Fred.

00:39.538 --> 00:41.667
‐I am done with him.
‐We can talk about that later.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.836
No, we can talk about it
right now.

00:42.919 --> 00:45.508
You're pregnant, Serena.

00:46.092 --> 00:47.177
Congratulations.

00:47.261 --> 00:49.348
[Lieutenant Stans]
Please don't lie to me again.

00:49.432 --> 00:52.438
‐Now, where are the Handmaids?
‐[grunts]

00:52.522 --> 00:54.568
June, don't tell them anything.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.739
[screaming]

00:57.281 --> 00:58.826
[Lieutenant Stans]
Tell me where they are.

00:58.909 --> 00:59.745
June...

00:59.828 --> 01:00.872
‐[June gasps]
‐[Sienna screams]

01:00.955 --> 01:02.041
You can't save her.

01:02.124 --> 01:04.295
I just...
I want her to stay alive.

01:04.378 --> 01:05.965
Getting June to talk.

01:06.049 --> 01:07.510
It could help you
stay in this house.

01:07.594 --> 01:10.725
You have to tell me
where the Handmaids are.

01:10.808 --> 01:12.854
Or they will hurt Hannah.

01:13.438 --> 01:17.154
It's okay, baby.
It's okay, baby.

01:17.237 --> 01:19.033
[Lieutenant Stans]
Where are the Handmaids?

01:19.660 --> 01:21.622
They're at the Murrow farmhouse.

01:21.705 --> 01:23.416
[Aunt Lydia]
Everything that has happened

01:23.501 --> 01:25.797
to Janine and the others,
you're responsible.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.132
Your fault.

01:27.717 --> 01:31.182
‐Just kill me.
‐Oh! [chuckles]

01:31.265 --> 01:33.395
Not one Handmaid can be spared.

01:33.478 --> 01:36.652
You are all going
to a Magdalene Colony.

01:36.735 --> 01:38.029
‐[June grunts]
‐[Aunt Lydia gasping]

01:38.113 --> 01:38.948
[Alma] Go!

01:39.031 --> 01:40.660
[railway crossing bells dinging]

01:44.041 --> 01:45.545
[screaming] Stop!

01:46.295 --> 01:47.464
[gunshot]

01:49.511 --> 01:51.557
[train horn blaring]

01:56.149 --> 01:57.819
[June and Janine panting]

01:57.902 --> 01:59.614
‐[June whispering] Stop.
‐[Janine] Oh.

01:59.698 --> 02:01.743
‐[June] Okay, hold still.
‐[Janine] We should wait maybe.

02:01.827 --> 02:03.163
‐[June] It's gonna work.
‐[Janine] June.

02:03.246 --> 02:04.290
[June] Look.

02:04.373 --> 02:05.375
Almost.

02:06.461 --> 02:07.296
[grunts]

02:08.674 --> 02:09.509
Okay, come on.

02:09.593 --> 02:11.805
June, I think that maybe
we should probably go back

02:11.889 --> 02:13.517
‐and see what happened to them.
‐No, no. We have to go.

02:13.601 --> 02:14.895
‐No. Janine‐‐
‐They may be okay and just...

02:14.978 --> 02:15.980
‐Come on!
‐...try to find them.

02:16.063 --> 02:18.151
Janine! They're dead!
They're dead, okay?

02:18.778 --> 02:21.407
‐No.
‐Yes. They're gone.

02:22.117 --> 02:23.119
[whimpers]

02:23.704 --> 02:24.706
They're gone.

02:25.457 --> 02:27.587
[both crying]

02:27.670 --> 02:28.964
[June] They're gone.

02:29.716 --> 02:32.221
Here's what we're
gonna do, okay?

02:32.304 --> 02:34.016
‐We're gonna go West.
‐Okay.

02:34.099 --> 02:35.895
‐We're gonna follow the tracks.
‐Mmm‐hmm.

02:36.939 --> 02:39.068
And we're gonna be okay.
All right?

02:39.151 --> 02:40.153
Mmm‐hmm.

02:41.489 --> 02:42.909
‐We're gonna be okay.
‐Okay.

02:42.909 --> 02:43.911
Okay.

02:50.800 --> 02:51.802
[both panting]

03:00.443 --> 03:02.406
[Janine whispering]
Which one's going to Boston?

03:02.489 --> 03:03.659
[June] We're not
going to Boston.

03:04.493 --> 03:05.913
[Janine] But we know
people there.

03:05.997 --> 03:07.876
I told you, we're going West.

03:07.959 --> 03:09.420
Keep fighting and find Mayday.

03:09.504 --> 03:10.965
‐What if‐‐
‐Quiet. Shh!

03:11.048 --> 03:12.301
[vehicles approaching]

03:19.649 --> 03:20.651
Come on.

03:24.366 --> 03:25.368
[soldier] See this here?

03:26.203 --> 03:28.041
Let's stack it, strap it down.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.586
They need this stuff in Chicago.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.802
That one.

03:34.804 --> 03:35.931
The one with the soldiers?

03:36.015 --> 03:37.935
Yeah. That one's
going to the front.

03:39.063 --> 03:40.691
June, why would we go
to the front of a war?

03:40.775 --> 03:42.027
Because that's where
they're still fighting.

03:42.862 --> 03:45.200
Chicago is still Chicago.
They're not giving up.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.626
People die in wars.
They get their arms blown off.

03:49.709 --> 03:51.630
I won't let
anything happen to you.

03:53.257 --> 03:54.385
Okay?

03:55.971 --> 03:56.973
Okay.

04:00.981 --> 04:03.194
‐[soldier 1] Give me a hand.
‐[soldier 2] Yeah, hang on.

04:04.781 --> 04:06.075
‐Ready?
‐Yeah.

04:06.576 --> 04:07.578
Go!

04:09.456 --> 04:11.043
[train horn blowing]

04:36.970 --> 04:37.972
Come on.

04:39.517 --> 04:40.519
You first.

04:50.121 --> 04:51.123
[both panting]

04:57.052 --> 04:58.555
Janine, follow me in.

05:05.110 --> 05:06.112
[gasping]

05:06.696 --> 05:07.740
[coughing]

05:08.617 --> 05:09.451
[gasping]

05:12.917 --> 05:13.961
It's milk.

05:14.671 --> 05:15.673
Shit.

05:17.092 --> 05:17.927
June?

05:18.010 --> 05:20.933
It's okay. Come on.
Janine, you have to jump.

05:21.601 --> 05:22.687
Come on, it's okay.

05:23.312 --> 05:24.189
Are you sure?

05:24.273 --> 05:27.362
Come on, hurry!
Come on! [panting]

05:29.701 --> 05:30.703
[Janine yelps]

05:32.122 --> 05:33.249
[gasping]

05:33.332 --> 05:35.754
Fuck, fuck, fuck! It's freezing.

05:35.838 --> 05:37.800
‐I know.
‐[gasping] June!

05:38.969 --> 05:40.305
I know. It's okay.

05:40.388 --> 05:42.518
[Guardian] Let's go!
Close that up!

05:42.602 --> 05:43.645
[Janine gasping]

05:43.729 --> 05:48.029
He's coming. He's coming.
Shh! Shut up. We have to hide.

05:48.112 --> 05:50.116
Okay? Ready?

05:52.204 --> 05:54.208
[footsteps approaching]

05:59.259 --> 06:00.596
[hatch latches]

06:01.556 --> 06:02.850
[Guardian] All clear.

06:04.604 --> 06:06.398
[both gasp]

06:07.652 --> 06:09.321
[coughing]

06:10.783 --> 06:13.037
[train rumbles, horn blowing]

06:14.916 --> 06:16.335
[breathing heavily]

06:16.377 --> 06:17.295
[June] Shit.

06:18.130 --> 06:20.218
We need something.
We need something.

06:21.095 --> 06:23.182
There has to be a drain.

06:25.061 --> 06:27.065
[gasping]

06:36.083 --> 06:38.630
[both gasp, cough]

06:41.427 --> 06:42.596
June!

06:51.614 --> 06:54.036
[both continue gasping]

06:57.208 --> 06:58.377
I feel something.

07:04.724 --> 07:06.143
‐[thuds]
‐[Janine] June!

07:08.147 --> 07:10.359
I found it. I found it.

07:10.527 --> 07:11.946
[milk draining]

07:17.290 --> 07:19.377
[breathing heavily]

07:42.173 --> 07:44.595
[train horn blaring]

08:08.142 --> 08:11.148
[children chattering
in distance]

08:25.844 --> 08:27.388
‐[Moira] Ah!
‐[Rita] There you go.

08:27.472 --> 08:29.644
[Moira] Oh, God,
you shouldn't have bothered.

08:29.727 --> 08:33.108
But, thank you.
This... this is incredible.

08:34.236 --> 08:36.031
Well, you've been very kind.

08:40.916 --> 08:43.003
There's no record of your sister

08:43.087 --> 08:48.890
or your nephew in any
of the refugee camp databases.

08:51.563 --> 08:53.650
I'm sorry I don't have
more concrete news.

08:53.733 --> 08:54.819
It's all right.

08:56.488 --> 08:58.409
I appreciate you checking.

08:58.535 --> 08:59.704
I'll keep looking.

09:00.329 --> 09:03.127
The Catholics were really
good at forging passports.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.214
They could've entered
under assumed names.

09:07.636 --> 09:09.557
May His light guide their souls.

09:16.194 --> 09:17.615
Is there something else?

09:19.827 --> 09:21.539
[Moira] I heard from the court.

09:22.457 --> 09:26.381
And, um, there's been
a request from Serena Joy.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.389
She wants to know
if you'll see her.

09:32.101 --> 09:33.103
Why?

09:34.356 --> 09:35.525
I do not know.

09:37.403 --> 09:39.282
She must know
that I've been deposed.

09:41.036 --> 09:42.455
I told them everything.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.960
I'm sure she's furious.

09:45.044 --> 09:46.798
Let her be furious.

09:48.175 --> 09:50.096
She's in a cell
where she belongs.

09:50.179 --> 09:52.643
She's only there because
she wanted to be with Nichole.

10:05.167 --> 10:06.169
I don't know.

10:07.840 --> 10:11.012
Being able to say your piece
to her face?

10:13.100 --> 10:16.983
Lotta girls I know would kill
for that kinda closure.

10:20.114 --> 10:22.160
Or you could let her
fucking rot.

10:29.717 --> 10:32.305
[door clanging in distance]

10:41.532 --> 10:43.745
[keypad beeps, door unlocks]

10:45.999 --> 10:47.418
[Serena] Rita.

10:51.552 --> 10:54.057
Praise be His blessed mercy.

10:55.184 --> 10:56.269
Ma'am.

10:57.355 --> 10:59.025
Thank you for coming.

11:00.612 --> 11:02.406
Please, sit down.

11:02.490 --> 11:03.450
‐[door closes]
‐I try not to be

11:03.535 --> 11:04.912
on my feet for too long.

11:09.045 --> 11:11.634
I'm sure you're wondering
why I asked you here.

11:12.553 --> 11:15.015
Yes, Ma'am, I am.

11:27.248 --> 11:28.500
I don't understand.

11:35.180 --> 11:37.978
[chuckles] God is truly great.

11:40.024 --> 11:41.694
I didn't believe it either.

11:45.577 --> 11:46.829
It's a miracle.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.503
[both laugh]

11:54.678 --> 11:56.641
I didn't think
the Commander could.

11:57.976 --> 12:02.527
Well, Gilead's clean water
and clean air and God's grace.

12:03.571 --> 12:06.201
It's what we always wanted.
What we always prayed for.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.207
He must be beside himself.

12:11.336 --> 12:13.006
I haven't told him.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.139
And I don't intend to.

12:18.559 --> 12:20.605
There is a reason
why God chose this moment,

12:20.689 --> 12:23.068
when Fred and I
are separated and...

12:26.116 --> 12:27.786
but now you're here.

12:28.495 --> 12:30.875
To help me care
for this little boy.

12:32.003 --> 12:33.422
It's a boy?

12:35.844 --> 12:37.889
‐It's a boy?
‐It's a boy.

12:40.729 --> 12:42.941
‐Can you imagine?
‐No.

12:43.025 --> 12:46.406
‐Toy trucks and scraped knees.
‐No.

12:46.489 --> 12:49.037
Catching frogs. [laughs]

12:49.621 --> 12:50.749
Oh.

12:51.584 --> 12:52.919
Praise be.

12:57.428 --> 12:58.765
I have missed you.

13:01.102 --> 13:03.190
My lovely Rita.

13:03.273 --> 13:05.695
You were always such a blessing.

13:11.372 --> 13:13.586
‐Thank you.
‐No, that's for you.

13:13.669 --> 13:16.049
So you can look at him
whenever you want.

13:23.523 --> 13:25.359
It's nice to have a friend.

13:33.709 --> 13:35.295
Would you pray with me?

13:37.383 --> 13:38.385
Yes.

13:45.148 --> 13:48.823
[Serena] God, we thank you
for your true and purest gift.

13:51.871 --> 13:53.164
[train rumbling]

13:53.248 --> 13:55.587
[train horn blaring]

13:55.670 --> 13:58.341
Janine. Wake up.

13:59.928 --> 14:02.474
You can't fall asleep
when it's this cold.

14:02.559 --> 14:04.521
Okay? You'll get hypothermia.

14:04.605 --> 14:06.775
No. That's concussions.

14:06.859 --> 14:08.779
You can't sleep
with one of them.

14:08.863 --> 14:09.865
No, it's both.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.787
I think it's both.

14:19.258 --> 14:21.722
‐Janine, wake up.
‐[murmurs]

14:28.234 --> 14:30.782
[voice shaking] I hate it.
I hate it in here!

14:31.366 --> 14:32.869
[June] I know. Me too.

14:34.581 --> 14:36.835
We're okay.
We're gonna be okay, so...

14:38.004 --> 14:39.508
How is this okay?

14:40.510 --> 14:42.304
Because we can get there
and we're gonna...

14:42.388 --> 14:43.808
we're gonna find them.

14:44.392 --> 14:46.104
And we're gonna find Mayday.
They're gonna help us.

14:46.187 --> 14:48.191
You keep saying that,
but you don't know.

14:48.274 --> 14:51.782
Do you have some secret,
brilliant plan?

14:54.621 --> 14:56.082
What is it?

14:56.165 --> 14:57.669
What's the plan?

14:58.378 --> 14:59.380
Well...

14:59.881 --> 15:04.348
‐Well...
‐I'm not a mushroom. I'm not!

15:05.685 --> 15:06.520
Okay.

15:06.603 --> 15:10.068
So you can't keep me in the dark
and feed me lies and shit

15:10.152 --> 15:12.406
and expect me
to just be okay with it!

15:14.160 --> 15:16.957
‐I don't do that.
‐Yes, you do.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.548
You don't... you don't know
where we're going,

15:20.631 --> 15:22.301
you don't know
if we're gonna be okay.

15:23.846 --> 15:25.516
I'm keeping us alive.

15:36.245 --> 15:37.999
They were the nicest.

15:40.630 --> 15:42.132
Alma and Brianna.

15:44.930 --> 15:46.349
Maybe that's why.

15:47.852 --> 15:49.271
What?

15:49.355 --> 15:51.317
Why God wanted them.

15:52.529 --> 15:53.656
And not us.

15:55.576 --> 15:57.079
At least not you.

15:58.999 --> 16:00.001
No.

16:02.089 --> 16:04.176
Hmm.
That's not how God works.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.182
Well, I think he does!

16:25.177 --> 16:26.847
When we were at the farm?

16:27.932 --> 16:29.351
When we were hiding?

16:34.028 --> 16:36.365
Alma said,
"We have to wait for June."

16:37.619 --> 16:40.123
She made sure we waited for you.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.171
'Cause she loves you.

16:46.595 --> 16:48.056
Loved you.

16:48.139 --> 16:49.517
They all loved you.

16:51.939 --> 16:55.320
Like... like a real, real love.

16:56.405 --> 16:58.409
I know that.

17:07.929 --> 17:10.475
Did you tell the Eyes
where to find us?

17:13.565 --> 17:18.199
We didn't tell anyone where we
were going, just like you said.

17:18.283 --> 17:20.161
They had her.

17:29.388 --> 17:30.975
They had Hannah.

17:33.313 --> 17:34.566
Okay?

17:35.693 --> 17:36.820
You saw her?

17:36.903 --> 17:39.491
And I didn't know what
they were gonna do to her.

17:40.578 --> 17:43.124
And I didn't know
if they were gonna hurt her.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.634
'Cause she was really scared.

17:47.717 --> 17:48.886
So, yes...

17:50.347 --> 17:53.604
I told them where you were.
Okay?

18:00.576 --> 18:01.828
Okay.

18:16.525 --> 18:18.737
You would have done
the same thing.

18:22.578 --> 18:24.791
You don't know
what I would have done.

18:26.628 --> 18:27.755
[scoffs]

18:28.757 --> 18:29.843
All right.

18:30.385 --> 18:32.515
Maybe I would've done
something better.

18:32.598 --> 18:35.604
‐Something smarter.
‐Like what, huh?

18:36.230 --> 18:37.984
Like what, Janine?

18:38.861 --> 18:41.282
Something stupid and dangerous,

18:41.365 --> 18:42.869
and then I would've
had to save your ass again.

18:42.952 --> 18:45.039
This is stupid and dangerous!

18:45.123 --> 18:49.089
We're going to the front
of a war in a refrigerator!

18:59.359 --> 19:01.615
I wouldn't have told them
where we were.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.165
You know that's why
they're dead.

19:32.175 --> 19:34.806
I should've left you
a long time ago.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.096
[train horn blowing]

19:56.933 --> 19:57.935
[Abby on phone] I need you here.

19:58.019 --> 19:59.689
You're supposed
to work the double.

19:59.772 --> 20:02.485
Uh, yeah.
I can't, I texted you.

20:02.570 --> 20:05.283
Um, I got Linda
to pick up my shift.

20:05.366 --> 20:06.870
Fucking Linda?

20:07.538 --> 20:09.249
Sam won't let me change the
schedule once I've posted it.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.504
You know how he gets.
He's a douchebag.

20:11.588 --> 20:13.424
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

20:13.466 --> 20:14.886
How soon can you get back?

20:14.969 --> 20:17.767
Um, I... I can't, um...

20:17.850 --> 20:19.562
You know, I'm gonna pick up
a shift tomorrow.

20:19.646 --> 20:21.691
I just...
I really need the time off.

20:22.233 --> 20:24.196
It's a doctor's appointment,
right?

20:24.279 --> 20:25.532
Just reschedule it.

20:25.616 --> 20:28.079
Um, it's time sensitive.

20:31.503 --> 20:32.337
Okay.

20:33.381 --> 20:34.383
Sorry.

20:35.176 --> 20:37.222
Fuck it. I'll deal with Sam.

20:37.932 --> 20:38.767
Seriously?

20:39.602 --> 20:42.023
‐Yeah.
‐Oh my... thank you so much.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.946
This... it just... it won't
happen again. Believe me.

20:45.363 --> 20:46.533
Better not, Janine.

20:52.377 --> 20:53.880
[Darla] I started volunteering
here at the clinic

20:53.964 --> 20:55.216
about a year ago.

20:55.299 --> 20:57.178
With all the insanity
surrounding the birth rate,

20:57.262 --> 20:58.640
I figured pregnant women
need all the help

20:58.724 --> 21:00.728
‐they can get, right?
‐[chuckles softly]

21:00.811 --> 21:01.980
Yeah, thanks.

21:08.535 --> 21:09.996
Um, is the doctor
gonna be a while?

21:10.079 --> 21:11.708
Depends. But first I just want

21:11.791 --> 21:13.377
to talk through
all your options.

21:13.461 --> 21:14.881
That's for you to keep.

21:14.964 --> 21:16.926
There's some really good
information in there.

21:19.599 --> 21:23.690
So, Janine. You're considering
abortion as your first option?

21:23.774 --> 21:26.361
Yeah. Yeah, that's why
I made the appointment.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.407
[Darla] Why is that?

21:29.451 --> 21:31.581
It just wasn't exactly planned.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.964
Sure. I get it.
Does the father know?

21:37.635 --> 21:41.350
Um, no, I haven't told anyone.

21:41.433 --> 21:42.812
Is he your boyfriend?

21:44.397 --> 21:45.567
Sometimes.

21:46.861 --> 21:48.280
You know, fatherhood

21:48.364 --> 21:50.326
can be transformational
for young guys.

21:50.409 --> 21:52.665
Maybe he'd want to raise
the baby with you.

21:52.748 --> 21:55.754
Um, yeah, no. I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:58.510 --> 21:59.637
Are you religious?

22:02.643 --> 22:03.687
Um...

22:04.229 --> 22:06.693
What does that have
to do with anything?

22:07.778 --> 22:09.824
Just trying to understand
your life a little,

22:09.907 --> 22:11.911
so I can help you make
the best choice.

22:14.166 --> 22:19.009
Um, okay. Well, my mom,
I think she's Methodist.

22:19.134 --> 22:21.890
Um, but we didn't really
go to church or anything.

22:21.973 --> 22:25.606
Well, what I think is someone
up there chose you for this.

22:25.689 --> 22:28.319
Uh, yeah, the condom fell off.
That's what happened.

22:28.402 --> 22:30.489
That doesn't mean
you can't have this baby.

22:34.749 --> 22:36.711
Abortion is dangerous.

22:37.713 --> 22:38.965
I don't want you
to go through with it

22:39.049 --> 22:40.468
if you don't have to.

22:40.552 --> 22:43.307
Uh, well, I want to go through
with it. That's why I'm here.

22:45.896 --> 22:47.566
Well, we don't do them here.

22:48.693 --> 22:49.695
What?

22:52.743 --> 22:55.289
Well, why the fuck would you
have me come in here?

22:56.124 --> 22:57.335
What is this place?

22:57.418 --> 22:59.256
Somewhere we can help you
understand what happens

22:59.339 --> 23:00.676
when you choose abortion.

23:00.759 --> 23:02.178
[sighs]

23:02.262 --> 23:03.890
They insert a tube into you

23:03.974 --> 23:06.061
and use it to tear
the baby apart.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.357
Jesus Christ.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.444
They pull it out
piece by piece.

23:10.529 --> 23:12.574
And if a tiny piece
is left inside,

23:12.658 --> 23:14.996
like a toe or a finger,

23:15.079 --> 23:17.166
the infection makes
you infertile.

23:19.254 --> 23:23.053
Your body was made to keep
that baby, not get rid of it.

23:26.853 --> 23:29.065
All women regret
doing this, Janine.

23:29.734 --> 23:31.111
You think you'll be fine.

23:31.194 --> 23:33.908
But no one's fine
after killing their baby.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.294
You don't know shit about me.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.549
I know you're used
to being underestimated.

23:42.383 --> 23:43.928
You think you can't do this,

23:44.847 --> 23:49.690
but you're strong, you're smart
and you'd be a great mom.

23:52.195 --> 23:55.744
You have no idea how much
you would love this baby.

23:58.165 --> 23:59.502
You don't have to rush.

23:59.585 --> 24:01.338
You have plenty of time
to think,

24:01.380 --> 24:03.258
to make
the right decision, okay?

24:05.388 --> 24:06.390
Okay.

24:12.193 --> 24:13.362
[knocking at door]

24:22.881 --> 24:24.008
[Rita] Mr. Tuello.

24:24.092 --> 24:25.971
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

24:26.054 --> 24:27.348
No, not at all.

24:28.475 --> 24:30.271
Uh... Please, come in.

24:30.396 --> 24:31.481
[Mark] Thank you.

24:31.566 --> 24:32.651
[door closes]

24:32.734 --> 24:34.362
‐Is everything okay?
‐Yes.

24:34.446 --> 24:36.032
I just came to drop this off

24:36.116 --> 24:38.412
and answer any questions
you might have.

24:39.456 --> 24:40.542
And what is this?

24:41.001 --> 24:42.086
Interview prep materials

24:42.170 --> 24:44.382
from Mrs. Waterford's
defense attorney.

24:48.265 --> 24:49.852
You weren't expecting this?

24:50.687 --> 24:51.606
No.

24:52.691 --> 24:53.860
I...

24:55.070 --> 24:56.532
What is this?

24:56.616 --> 25:00.456
Um... Mrs. Waterford's attorneys
claim you can corroborate

25:00.540 --> 25:02.084
that any action she took

25:02.168 --> 25:04.214
regarding June Osborn's
pregnancy

25:04.297 --> 25:07.053
was a result of extreme duress

25:07.136 --> 25:09.558
inflicted upon her
by her husband.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.946
She wants me
to blame the Commander.

25:16.029 --> 25:18.075
That seems to be their strategy.

25:18.158 --> 25:19.327
[Rita] Mmm.

25:19.787 --> 25:22.543
Apparently she was very
moved by your visit.

25:24.170 --> 25:27.761
She believes the two of you
share a strong bond.

25:36.988 --> 25:41.747
Did you know in Gilead I was
officially considered property

25:44.419 --> 25:45.964
of the Waterford family?

25:46.089 --> 25:47.593
I did, yes.

25:47.676 --> 25:48.886
Hmm.

25:49.513 --> 25:51.266
Registered and everything.

25:52.894 --> 25:54.732
Like my old Nissan Altima.

26:16.567 --> 26:17.569
[door beeps, opens]

26:20.909 --> 26:21.911
[Rita] Hello, sir.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.209
[Commander Fred gasps softly]

26:27.171 --> 26:28.298
[Commander Fred] Rita.

26:32.683 --> 26:34.102
I hardly recognized you.

26:39.404 --> 26:40.406
How are you?

26:44.122 --> 26:45.625
Are you with your family?

26:48.171 --> 26:49.800
With respect, sir, I...

26:52.597 --> 26:53.975
I'd rather not say.

26:56.187 --> 26:57.356
Of course.

27:03.368 --> 27:05.164
You're free to do as you please.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.838
Yes, I am.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.854
It's nice to see
a friendly face.

27:19.818 --> 27:20.945
We aren't friends.

27:24.410 --> 27:25.412
No.

27:27.751 --> 27:29.170
I suppose we're not.

27:34.096 --> 27:35.642
Why have you come?

27:49.168 --> 27:53.218
You deal with your family.
It's not my job anymore.

27:54.846 --> 27:57.561
And I thank God
for that every day.

28:00.984 --> 28:02.821
I was never cruel to you.

28:06.704 --> 28:08.541
I'll pray for your son.

28:52.086 --> 28:54.090
[train engine chugging]

‐[loud thud]
‐[brakes screech]

29:03.149 --> 29:04.986
[Janine] What's that?
What the hell was that?

29:05.070 --> 29:06.532
‐I don't know.
‐[metallic thud]

29:06.615 --> 29:08.619
‐[gunshots]
‐[men] They're armed!

Shit.

29:09.705 --> 29:10.748
[man screams]

29:11.374 --> 29:12.752
[June] We should get out.

29:12.836 --> 29:14.296
What? Fuck that.

29:14.756 --> 29:17.177
No, If they're attacking
a Gilead train,

29:17.261 --> 29:18.723
then it's not Gilead.

29:18.806 --> 29:19.808
So what?

29:20.350 --> 29:21.729
So that's what we want.

29:21.812 --> 29:23.189
‐What‐‐
‐[man 2] Let's go fast!

29:23.649 --> 29:25.193
‐Come on, give me a leg up.
‐Um...

29:25.277 --> 29:26.530
‐Janine.
‐Okay.

29:27.239 --> 29:28.909
‐[June] Okay?
‐Okay.

29:29.536 --> 29:30.412
[grunts]

[man 2] Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

29:54.878 --> 29:56.882
[woman]
Two minutes, two minutes!

‐[woman 2] Hey!
‐[gun cocks]

30:00.973 --> 30:02.644
Who the fuck are you?

30:06.944 --> 30:07.862
My name is June.

30:08.656 --> 30:11.327
‐Please, we're not armed.
‐[woman 2] We?

30:14.208 --> 30:15.210
[softly] Come on.

30:19.301 --> 30:20.638
[Janine grunting]

30:35.250 --> 30:36.335
Hi.

30:37.212 --> 30:38.716
It's just us.

30:39.926 --> 30:41.178
‐Down.
‐[woman] Come on, let's go!

30:41.262 --> 30:43.809
[indistinct chatter]

30:46.480 --> 30:47.650
‐It's okay.
‐[Janine] Okay.

30:47.734 --> 30:49.111
[June] Let's go.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.038
[man] Come on, come on, come on.

31:03.641 --> 31:04.517
Search them.

31:05.937 --> 31:07.857
[June] Hey, I told you,
we don't have anything.

31:07.982 --> 31:10.529
[woman] Hustle! Come on!
I need this! Someone!

31:11.113 --> 31:13.535
We need your help.
We're trying to get to Chicago.

31:14.203 --> 31:16.625
You have owners, right?
Are they looking for you?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.211
No one knows where we are.

31:18.294 --> 31:21.510
We're just trying...
to get somewhere safe.

31:24.014 --> 31:25.601
[man] I got 'em. Looks good.

31:26.268 --> 31:27.354
Steven.

31:33.157 --> 31:34.869
Jesus Christ.

31:35.495 --> 31:37.165
[man] Get in the truck!
Let's go!

31:37.249 --> 31:40.380
They wanna come with us,
but they're walking targets.

31:40.463 --> 31:44.054
Hey, we've gotten this far
without anyone finding us.

31:45.348 --> 31:46.727
You can trust us.

31:48.605 --> 31:50.191
And I should believe you?

31:51.360 --> 31:53.615
[man] Drop that bullshit!
We don't need it!

31:53.741 --> 31:55.368
We'll do anything you say.

31:57.707 --> 31:58.709
We need you.

32:03.468 --> 32:05.346
‐Get them in the truck.
‐[woman 2] Steven, how can‐‐

32:05.430 --> 32:08.352
[Steven] Everyone, right now!
We've been here too long.

32:08.436 --> 32:10.398
[man] Let's go! Come on, go!

32:10.482 --> 32:13.112
‐Hey. Are they Mayday?
‐I don't know.

32:13.906 --> 32:15.075
They're mean.

32:15.158 --> 32:17.120
They're on our side,
and you're coming.

32:17.204 --> 32:19.041
‐[man] Ride over with him.
‐[woman] Okay.

32:19.124 --> 32:20.711
‐Where else am I going to go?
‐Okay.

32:22.882 --> 32:25.220
[jet engine roaring]

33:35.151 --> 33:38.157
[car door opens, closes]

33:42.249 --> 33:43.376
Get them inside.

33:46.549 --> 33:48.135
[indistinct chatter]

33:49.639 --> 33:51.643
[helicopter hovering]

34:05.838 --> 34:07.800
[chatter continues indistinctly]

34:42.578 --> 34:44.081
[Steven] How did you escape?

34:45.208 --> 34:46.920
I heard they kept you in chains.

34:48.005 --> 34:49.383
Not exactly.

34:51.638 --> 34:54.351
Actual fucking sex slaves
in America.

34:54.434 --> 34:55.729
We weren't in America.

34:56.731 --> 34:57.983
[Steven] Yeah, I guess not.

34:59.444 --> 35:03.578
Well, welcome back.
It's a fucking disaster.

35:05.833 --> 35:07.377
‐Hey.
‐It's okay. I'm okay.

35:07.460 --> 35:09.423
‐You okay?
‐Mmm‐hmm.

35:09.464 --> 35:10.843
She hasn't eaten anything.

35:10.926 --> 35:12.178
[woman 2] Get used to it.

35:12.847 --> 35:14.433
We need a place to stay.

35:16.103 --> 35:17.230
Come on, we need some food.

35:17.313 --> 35:18.859
[Steven] This isn't a charity.

35:18.942 --> 35:20.194
Whatever we pulled off
that train

35:20.278 --> 35:21.405
is all we've gotten in weeks.

35:21.488 --> 35:23.117
[June] We're not asking
for charity.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.079
You have no idea
what we've done.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.294
We can be useful.

35:39.065 --> 35:43.784
Theresa will get you
some clothes and some food.

35:43.867 --> 35:44.869
Thank you.

35:45.954 --> 35:47.290
‐Okay? Okay.
‐Okay.

35:48.292 --> 35:49.962
[Steven] Which one of you
is staying with me?

35:50.046 --> 35:51.048
What?

35:54.346 --> 35:55.766
Either one of you is fine.

36:03.197 --> 36:04.449
That's not what I meant.

36:07.832 --> 36:09.376
It's what you've got.

36:12.925 --> 36:14.344
Nothing's free here.

36:21.316 --> 36:22.318
Not her.

36:35.344 --> 36:37.683
Go on. Go with her.
I'll be fine.

36:37.766 --> 36:39.352
‐[Janine] Are you sure?
‐Yeah.

36:39.436 --> 36:41.608
Please get her something warm.

36:41.691 --> 36:44.237
It's fine. We'll see you soon.
Go on.

37:10.164 --> 37:12.043
[Steven]
Guess you're used to this.

37:30.914 --> 37:32.918
[breathing shakily]

37:36.926 --> 37:37.928
Hey.

37:41.018 --> 37:42.771
I'm not gonna force you.

37:45.359 --> 37:46.904
You guys can just go.

37:52.583 --> 37:53.877
[sighs]

38:03.605 --> 38:05.191
You're not Mayday, are you?

38:07.487 --> 38:08.656
What's Mayday?

38:17.841 --> 38:19.512
[jet flying over]

38:31.869 --> 38:32.704
[Janine] Hey.

38:32.788 --> 38:34.583
Theresa said clothes are
what they have a lot of,

38:34.667 --> 38:36.712
‐since the stores were full‐‐
‐We can't stay here.

38:40.261 --> 38:41.346
What happened?

38:41.973 --> 38:43.100
Did he hurt you?

38:45.856 --> 38:46.858
No.

38:47.818 --> 38:49.404
We'll go someplace else, okay?

38:52.076 --> 38:52.911
Okay.

38:52.995 --> 38:54.540
We're gonna find someplace safe.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.461
‐I promise. We'll be okay.
‐Okay.

38:59.132 --> 39:00.384
We'll be okay.

39:03.140 --> 39:05.604
Um, well,
you should change first.

39:11.574 --> 39:12.576
Okay.

39:16.249 --> 39:17.335
It's okay.

39:30.946 --> 39:33.952
[muffled upbeat music

‐[chortles]
‐Hey, you. Come here.

40:03.553 --> 40:05.974
I got you. [chuckles]

40:06.684 --> 40:09.022
Oh, you.
You're supposed to be in bed.

40:09.105 --> 40:10.357
You silly.

40:10.441 --> 40:12.111
Okay, here we go.

‐[doctor] Janine.

40:58.538 --> 41:00.082
Hi. I'm Dr. Thomas.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.794
It's nice to meet you.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.589
You too.

41:03.673 --> 41:05.885
So how are you doing?
You're feeling okay?

41:06.595 --> 41:07.806
Yeah.

41:07.889 --> 41:09.434
I know that it's not easy
to be here.

41:09.518 --> 41:12.273
Did the nurse get a chance to go
over all your options with you?

41:13.526 --> 41:16.072
Um, yeah.

41:16.197 --> 41:17.659
Yeah, she did, and look,

41:17.742 --> 41:19.538
I know I could probably
keep the kid. I...

41:19.621 --> 41:20.832
I know that I just...

41:20.915 --> 41:22.627
I already have a son
and it's just me,

41:22.711 --> 41:23.629
and I have a job,

41:23.713 --> 41:25.215
but it's barely enough
for the both of us,

41:25.299 --> 41:26.468
and I was thinking
about enrolling

41:26.552 --> 41:28.388
in school next semester because
he's finally old enough‐‐

41:28.472 --> 41:30.727
Hang on. Do you wanna be
pregnant right now?

41:33.398 --> 41:34.400
No.

41:35.152 --> 41:36.739
And you're comfortable
with your choice?

41:36.822 --> 41:38.325
You're making
this decision yourself?

41:39.160 --> 41:40.204
Yes.

41:40.287 --> 41:42.166
Then the rest
is none of my business.

41:42.918 --> 41:45.965
I am required by law to tell you
that an abortion procedure

41:46.049 --> 41:48.470
can lead to an increased risk
of breast cancer,

41:48.554 --> 41:50.182
infertility and depression.

41:50.934 --> 41:51.894
And not by law,

41:51.936 --> 41:54.065
I'm also gonna say that
that's a bunch of crap.

41:56.612 --> 41:57.656
The other place made it
sound like

41:57.739 --> 41:59.660
something really horrible
would happen.

41:59.743 --> 42:02.498
Did you search abortion clinics
online and end up there?

42:06.590 --> 42:08.301
They're called
"crisis pregnancy centers,"

42:08.385 --> 42:09.387
and they lie to women

42:09.470 --> 42:11.684
to convince them
to keep unwanted pregnancies.

42:13.019 --> 42:14.982
I'm sorry
you had to go through that.

42:16.192 --> 42:18.446
You take one now,
and four tomorrow morning.

42:18.531 --> 42:20.492
You'll have some cramping
and bleeding.

42:20.577 --> 42:22.496
Maybe some fatigue and nausea.

42:22.581 --> 42:23.874
But if your symptoms last
more than two days,

42:23.958 --> 42:25.127
I want you to call me.

42:27.256 --> 42:28.634
That's it?

42:29.928 --> 42:31.724
You already did the hard part.

42:38.403 --> 42:39.488
Thank you.

42:39.990 --> 42:40.992
You're welcome.

43:04.706 --> 43:05.708
Amen.

44:42.777 --> 44:44.113
Here. We can stay.

44:52.129 --> 44:53.298
It wasn't so bad.

44:54.466 --> 44:56.220

[helicopter blades whirring]

45:07.827 --> 45:09.079
I'm sorry.

45:12.502 --> 45:13.589
It's okay.

45:16.469 --> 45:17.471
Eat.
