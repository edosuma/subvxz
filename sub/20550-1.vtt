00:14.914 --> 00:19.533
well, now, it takes
more than a robin

00:19.601 --> 00:22.787
to make the winter go

00:22.854 --> 00:26.791
and it takes
two lips of fire

00:26.858 --> 00:29.960
to melt away the snow

00:30.028 --> 00:34.131
well, it takes
two hearts a-cookin'

00:34.199 --> 00:37.301
to make a fire grow

00:37.368 --> 00:39.469
and, baby

00:39.537 --> 00:42.706
you've got what it takes

00:44.209 --> 00:48.478
you know it takes
a lot of kissing

00:48.546 --> 00:51.315
to make a romance sweet

00:51.382 --> 00:55.652
ooh, it takes
a lot of lovin'

00:55.720 --> 00:59.156
to make my life complete

00:59.224 --> 01:02.927
and it takes a lot of woman

01:02.994 --> 01:06.530
to knock me off my feet

01:06.597 --> 01:08.432
and, baby

01:08.499 --> 01:12.002
you've got what it takes

01:13.171 --> 01:17.774
I said hmm

01:20.678 --> 01:24.781
uh-huh hmm

01:24.850 --> 01:27.952
you know you've got
just what it takes

01:28.019 --> 01:32.122
because it takes more
than an effort

01:32.190 --> 01:34.959
to stay away from you

01:36.027 --> 01:38.963
it'd take more
than a lifetime

01:39.030 --> 01:42.466
to prove that I'll be true

01:42.533 --> 01:46.470
but it takes
somebody special

01:46.537 --> 01:49.473
to make me say I do

01:49.540 --> 01:51.976
and, baby

01:52.043 --> 01:55.212
you've got what it takes

02:25.442 --> 02:27.643
<i>what's down there?</i>

02:28.012 --> 02:29.778
Probably just whales, sir.

02:33.517 --> 02:35.485
Take it down.
But, sir-

02:35.552 --> 02:38.954
Take it down!
Yes, major marshall.

02:56.540 --> 02:59.542
Uh, sir, isn't that your-

03:03.914 --> 03:07.550
<i>Yeah. Beautiful,
isn't she?</i>

03:31.442 --> 03:33.443
Daddy.

04:14.935 --> 04:18.070
Major marshall.

04:22.075 --> 04:24.777
Shit.

04:49.970 --> 04:52.237
B44682, bradford.

04:52.305 --> 04:55.908
B11567, hall.

04:55.976 --> 04:58.294
Major.

05:01.748 --> 05:03.749
Over here.

05:07.087 --> 05:09.855
What the hell are you
gonna do about your wife?

05:09.923 --> 05:11.857
Is the colonel concerned
about my wife, sir?

05:11.925 --> 05:14.727
She's a disgrace to the army
and she's endangering your job.

05:15.095 --> 05:19.231
My job, sir, is to evaluate
radiation hazards to united
states army personnel.

05:19.633 --> 05:22.868
My wife's not enlisted.
Why doesn't the colonel concern
himself with the men who are...

05:22.936 --> 05:25.004
Rather than the mammaries
of women who are not?

05:25.138 --> 05:27.372
That's very close
to insubordination, marshall.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.542
It'll be noted along
with all the other incidents.
Very good, sir.

05:30.610 --> 05:35.331
Don't make any waves, marshall.
I don't like waves.
Very good, sir.

05:43.623 --> 05:46.291
The guest officers
from nato are visiting, sir.

06:23.096 --> 06:25.030
<i>caro, caro.</i>

06:25.098 --> 06:27.099
Hello, baby.

06:29.268 --> 06:32.537
This is yves.
Yves is from France.

06:32.605 --> 06:34.707
This is my husband.

06:34.774 --> 06:37.209
Bonjour, major.

06:37.276 --> 06:40.713
<i>You have a very lovely home and
a very beautiful mademoiselle.</i>

06:40.780 --> 06:44.783
Thank you. I'm glad you have
a chance to see the average
american housewife in action.

06:46.352 --> 06:49.554
<i>Gentlemen, I think
we must go now and
prepare for dinner.</i>

06:49.622 --> 06:52.057
<i>No, don't go.
Senorita.</i>

06:52.125 --> 06:54.059
Make them stay.

06:54.127 --> 06:56.461
Please stay.
Really, we must go.

06:58.131 --> 06:59.998
<i>Bonsoir, monsieur.
Enchante.
Bonsoir.</i>

07:00.066 --> 07:03.102
<i>Hasta la vista.
Hasta la vista.</i>

07:03.236 --> 07:05.503
<i>Au revoir.
Ciao.
Auf wiedersehen.</i>

07:05.571 --> 07:09.742
<i>Arrivederci.
Ciao. Au revoir.</i>

07:10.744 --> 07:12.745
<i>Ciao.</i>

07:24.758 --> 07:27.359
Why you want
to spoil my party?

07:27.426 --> 07:30.863
You went too far today.
Half the people on this base
saw you at the beach.

07:30.930 --> 07:33.531
Oh, jesus christ.

07:33.599 --> 07:35.868
Brigitte bardot strips
for millions, she's a goddess.

07:35.935 --> 07:38.203
I sunbathe topless
and I'm a scandal.

07:38.271 --> 07:40.939
You're not brigitte
bardot, remember?

07:45.278 --> 07:50.048
What's the matter?
I don't make you happy?

07:50.116 --> 07:52.050
Come on, have a drink.
You'll feel better.

07:52.118 --> 07:56.454
I'd feel better
if I didn't have to worry
about you screwing around.

07:58.624 --> 08:01.160
I've been good
for two years.

08:01.227 --> 08:04.062
That's not
what it seemed like
this afternoon.

08:09.568 --> 08:12.171
I've got a severe
radiation leak on site.

08:12.238 --> 08:15.340
The colonel is
looking for any excuse
to discredit me.

08:15.408 --> 08:17.676
Ooh.

08:17.743 --> 08:20.345
I sure gave him two good ones
today, didn't I?

08:20.413 --> 08:22.414
Well, yes, you did.

08:24.083 --> 08:27.419
<i>Where are the children?
At the cinema, mi amore.</i>

08:29.455 --> 08:32.857
Well, pack up your
old kit bag, pal.
You're alabamy bound.

08:32.926 --> 08:35.827
<i>Don't worry about it, bob.
I'm tired of paradise.</i>

08:35.828 --> 08:38.530
You know, this transfer
didn't come out of nowhere.

08:38.597 --> 08:42.366
Anawalt was not happy
you filed that report
with the a.E.C.

08:42.434 --> 08:45.537
Neither was I,
but so it goes
in this man's army.

08:45.604 --> 08:49.708
Uh, carly's from somewhere
down south, isn't she?

08:49.775 --> 08:51.710
Yes. Virginia.

08:51.777 --> 08:55.214
Well, maybe she'd be
a little happier
closer to home.

08:55.281 --> 08:59.117
She ran away from home, bob.
She likes paradise.

09:16.903 --> 09:18.837
Mom will never make it.

09:18.905 --> 09:21.740
Oh, yes,
of course she will.

09:24.077 --> 09:26.078
It's her, daddy.

09:32.252 --> 09:34.253
Well?

09:42.395 --> 09:45.264
What do you think?

09:53.505 --> 09:57.675
of course you'll make new
friends, honey. You always do.

09:57.877 --> 09:59.677
As soon as we get there,
we'll go looking...

09:59.745 --> 10:04.349
For the most beautiful
southern belle doll.

10:05.351 --> 10:07.485
Maybe we'll find
a scarlet o'hara.

10:07.887 --> 10:11.122
She's too old for dolls.
I am not.

10:11.190 --> 10:14.392
Not everybody spends
every waking minute
buried in a book.

10:14.393 --> 10:17.128
It's good to read.

10:17.196 --> 10:21.632
Alex might just
wind up a famous writer
like her aunt gail.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.768
<i>She's not famous.</i>

10:23.903 --> 10:28.373
She writes obituaries
for her church bulletin.

10:46.725 --> 10:48.993
you know, I got a good feeling
about fort matthews.

10:49.061 --> 10:53.497
<i>I think we're going
to be very happy here.</i>

10:53.565 --> 10:59.337
'cause I'm goin' to alabama
with a banjo on my knee

10:59.405 --> 11:02.106
I don't think
I've got the words right.

11:04.893 --> 11:06.610
camptown ladies
sing this song

11:06.678 --> 11:09.280
do dah do dah

11:09.348 --> 11:11.449
camptown race track's
five miles long

11:11.516 --> 11:13.551
oh do dah day

11:13.902 --> 11:16.654
g'wine to run all night

11:16.956 --> 11:19.257
<i>g'wine to run all day</i>

11:19.458 --> 11:22.626
bet my money
on a bobtailed nag

11:22.694 --> 11:24.728
<i>Come on, girls.
oh, the do dah day</i>

11:24.964 --> 11:29.200
No, not "all the do dah day."
it's "somebody bet on the bay."

11:32.204 --> 11:35.273
g'wine to run all night
g'wine to run all day

11:35.474 --> 11:39.543
bet my money on a bobtail nag
somebody bet on the bay

11:42.481 --> 11:45.316
Come on, girls.
I wished I was
in the land of cotton

11:45.384 --> 11:47.318
old times there
are not forgotten

11:47.386 --> 11:50.888
look away, look away
look away

11:53.492 --> 11:55.659
<i>dixieland</i>

11:55.995 --> 11:59.330
I wished I was in dixie

11:59.398 --> 12:01.299
away

12:01.500 --> 12:05.103
The ball was
out of bounds.
I'll get it.

12:05.170 --> 12:08.006
I said come in here right now.

12:46.045 --> 12:48.212
God, what a dump.

12:52.384 --> 12:54.652
Is this the best
we could do?

12:54.719 --> 12:59.657
We have lived in worse,
and your mother has always
made it your home.

13:21.513 --> 13:25.015
oh, they had cats.

13:27.186 --> 13:31.656
We'll have this place
in "a" number one condition...

13:31.723 --> 13:34.392
In no time at all.

13:34.460 --> 13:37.462
Our own furniture
is not even gonna be here
for six weeks, hank.

13:37.529 --> 13:40.364
What are we supposed
to do in the mean time?

13:43.368 --> 13:45.636
Mom, why don't you come
and help us make the beds?

13:45.704 --> 13:49.039
<i>no, you girls do it, okay?
You make the beds.</i>

13:51.276 --> 13:53.877
<i>First dibs on beds.
It's yours.</i>

13:56.315 --> 14:00.751
Look at this, hank.
It's all clawed to bits,
like a-

14:00.819 --> 14:03.754
People live like animals
and then they just leave
their shit behind them...

14:03.822 --> 14:05.990
For everybody else
to take care of.
Honey, you're tired.

14:06.125 --> 14:08.759
You're exhausted.
Why don't you lie down?

14:08.827 --> 14:13.498
<i>In what? In a litter box
like some stray cat?
It's starting again.</i>

14:15.000 --> 14:19.053
I'm not gonna live here, hank!
I hate this place!

14:19.171 --> 14:22.273
Carly, cut it out.
You're a big girl. This
isn't the end of the world.

14:22.341 --> 14:26.277
No, it's just the same goddamn
world we had in washington,

14:26.345 --> 14:28.279
Only it's worse.

14:28.347 --> 14:32.116
Look, everything that was
on the right is on the left.

14:32.184 --> 14:36.454
Right and left
and right and left
and right and left!

14:36.655 --> 14:40.791
Only it's worse
and we're all ten years older!

14:40.859 --> 14:43.961
These rooms are smaller!

14:51.670 --> 14:53.638
Get me out of here!

14:53.705 --> 14:57.975
Carly, it's okay.
We were okay in germany.
We were okay in washington.

14:58.043 --> 15:00.077
We're gonna be okay
in alabama.

15:00.145 --> 15:03.247
Don't talk to me so carefully.
I hate it when you
talk to me like this.

15:03.315 --> 15:05.249
Stop it right now!
Stop it!
No!

15:05.317 --> 15:07.918
No, I'm not
gonna live here!

15:07.986 --> 15:11.322
I won't live
in this fleabag!

15:18.329 --> 15:20.698
Carly!
Carly!

15:21.833 --> 15:24.268
Where the hell
are you going?

15:26.705 --> 15:29.207
Carly!

15:30.275 --> 15:33.211
Get out of the jeep.

15:48.727 --> 15:51.028
- God damn you!
I hate you!
- Carly!

15:51.230 --> 15:54.031
I hate you. I hate you.

16:02.641 --> 16:04.808
Well.
May I help you?

16:06.311 --> 16:11.081
Eighteen years
of shitboxes and...

16:11.149 --> 16:13.484
Packing and moving and...

16:15.487 --> 16:18.222
New neighbors
and ugly bases and...

16:18.290 --> 16:20.258
Now this cat piss.

16:21.460 --> 16:24.862
Have you seen that place?

16:25.213 --> 16:27.097
Are you okay, dear?

16:37.726 --> 16:40.077
<i>You get out of here!
Don't worry about it.
I'll handle this.</i>

16:40.145 --> 16:43.847
<i>- I hope so.
- Get him out of here.</i>

16:49.821 --> 16:51.789
Carly.

16:53.325 --> 16:55.293
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

16:57.829 --> 17:03.301
- Don't you touch me.
- I wouldn't let
anybody hurt you.

17:04.903 --> 17:07.003
<i>I can see it.</i>

17:07.355 --> 17:12.409
I can see that radiation
just coming off of you.

17:13.711 --> 17:18.681
No. No, you get your goddamn
contaminated hands off me.

17:18.749 --> 17:22.419
Carly, do you trust me?

17:22.420 --> 17:27.023
Do you think I know you?
Do you? Hmm?

17:27.090 --> 17:30.027
Well, listen to me then.

17:30.094 --> 17:34.431
You have nothing
to be afraid of.

17:37.268 --> 17:40.537
Do you want to go home?

17:40.604 --> 17:42.940
Hmm?

17:46.444 --> 17:49.712
So, come on.

17:49.780 --> 17:52.049
Let's go home.

17:52.116 --> 17:54.484
Come on.

17:55.619 --> 17:57.120
Come on.

18:00.558 --> 18:02.559
Come on.

18:19.243 --> 18:21.244
The car.

18:33.257 --> 18:36.193
<i>Is she okay?
What happened?</i>

18:36.260 --> 18:40.530
Mom's fine.
She's... Tired.

18:40.598 --> 18:43.266
She needs
a little rest,
that's all.

20:01.612 --> 20:03.547
Do you still love me, daddy?

20:03.614 --> 20:05.715
Mm-hmm.

20:05.783 --> 20:07.784
Do you love me?
Oh, yeah.

20:07.851 --> 20:09.786
Do you love me?
Yes.

20:09.853 --> 20:11.788
Do you love me?
Yes, I do.

20:11.855 --> 20:13.790
Do you love me?
Yes, yes.

20:13.857 --> 20:17.394
Do you love me?
Oh, yeah. Yes.

20:17.462 --> 20:20.397
She's got
to see somebody.

20:20.465 --> 20:23.233
You can't keep
running after her
and playing baby-sitter.

20:23.301 --> 20:25.569
Your mom's fine.
She's spirited,
she's energetic.

20:25.636 --> 20:28.738
Sometimes she wears
herself out with all
the traveling and moving.

20:28.806 --> 20:30.740
Don't worry about it.
I can handle your mom.

20:30.808 --> 20:32.909
We can all handle
each other's problems.

20:32.977 --> 20:36.313
Dad, we didn't move here
just because of the project
you're working on.

20:36.614 --> 20:40.750
You don't know what project I'm
working on. That's classified.
You don't know a thing about it.

20:40.818 --> 20:44.254
Maybe you and mom want to live
in your own little world
of make-believe and secrets,

20:44.322 --> 20:46.256
But we don't.

20:46.324 --> 20:50.594
Her famous aunt gail
we're always hearing about-
alex.

20:50.661 --> 20:55.098
Well, you heard mom yesterday.
The most popular girl
in richmond?

20:55.166 --> 20:59.436
<i>She grew up on a chicken
farm outside of norfolk.
She needs help.</i>

20:59.504 --> 21:03.373
She needs help arranging
the furniture and unpacking
the suitcases, miss freud.

21:03.441 --> 21:05.708
Sit down there.

21:05.776 --> 21:09.946
The perfect pancake.
Perfect.

21:18.956 --> 21:21.824
Girls, I know it's hard
on you, but your mother
loves you very much.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.227
And I know you love her.

21:24.295 --> 21:29.866
Through all the ups and downs
I've come to realize...

21:29.933 --> 21:33.770
That what we call love
is really the exchange
of energy over time.

21:34.121 --> 21:36.105
It's simple quantum mechanics.

21:36.174 --> 21:42.078
You take water, for example.
Sometimes it's water,
sometimes it's ice,

21:42.146 --> 21:46.082
Sometimes
it's steam or vapor-

21:46.150 --> 21:49.819
It's always the same old h2o.
It only changes it's properties.

21:51.155 --> 21:53.590
Your mother's like that.

21:53.658 --> 21:56.193
She's like water.

21:58.996 --> 22:03.933
I made a decision
a long time ago just
to love her basic properties.

22:06.103 --> 22:09.772
Little did I realize, I'd gone
nuclear fission in that water.

22:11.209 --> 22:13.310
Get it?

22:13.661 --> 22:15.712
Get it?

22:17.615 --> 22:19.882
I made a pun.

22:19.950 --> 22:22.719
I went nuclear fishin'.
It's a pun.

22:22.786 --> 22:26.223
You're a riot, dad.

22:26.290 --> 22:30.727
<i>And we both know
a lot more about love now.</i>

22:33.231 --> 22:34.897
See you later, ladies.

22:34.965 --> 22:38.868
- He's blind and she's crazy.
- They're perfect
for each other.

22:43.474 --> 22:45.808
Nobody woke me up.

22:48.812 --> 22:54.651
You know how I always like
to make breakfast the first
morning in a new house.

22:59.757 --> 23:02.191
<i>How are the beds?</i>

23:02.260 --> 23:05.262
Okay.

23:08.599 --> 23:11.268
I'm sorry.

23:16.774 --> 23:19.776
You're always sorry.

23:22.112 --> 23:24.547
Well, I guess
they add up, don't they?

23:24.615 --> 23:29.952
I'm just a sorry, sorry
excuse for a mother.

23:31.121 --> 23:34.056
If you say so, mom.

23:34.124 --> 23:37.226
No, you're a good mother.

23:43.801 --> 23:48.237
You know, life hands you
a lot of surprises, alex.

23:48.306 --> 23:51.474
I guess I must be
one of yours.

23:59.149 --> 24:01.017
Good morning, sir.
Colonel johnson?

24:01.084 --> 24:03.085
Yes, sir.
End of the corridor.

24:20.270 --> 24:22.706
Major henry t. Marshall
reporting for duty, sir.

24:22.773 --> 24:27.043
- Major marshall,
good to have you here.
- Thank you, sir.

24:27.110 --> 24:29.713
This is my executive officer,
lt. Colonel george land.

24:29.780 --> 24:33.115
Major, we've heard
good things about your work.
Thank you, sir.

24:33.183 --> 24:35.352
I'll let you two
get down to business.

24:36.454 --> 24:39.889
Sit down, sit down, major.

24:39.957 --> 24:42.559
Your trip go okay?
Your family settling in?

24:42.860 --> 24:46.363
Yes, sir.
They're professionals.
Good, good.

25:03.680 --> 25:07.283
Hi there,
I'm vera johnson.

25:07.351 --> 25:10.453
And on behalf
of the fort matthews
women's welcoming committee,

25:10.520 --> 25:14.790
I would like to welcome you
to our little community.

25:14.859 --> 25:17.460
Thank you.
I'm carly marshall.

25:17.527 --> 25:20.629
Thank you so much.

25:20.697 --> 25:23.299
<i>Flowers.</i>

25:23.367 --> 25:27.203
<i>Oh, come in. I'm sorry.
You just come right on in.</i>

25:32.877 --> 25:36.980
- Oh, what a beautiful
doll collection.
- Thank you.

25:37.047 --> 25:39.983
So, you've been
stationed in hawaii?

25:40.050 --> 25:42.986
For two years,
the last two years.

25:43.053 --> 25:45.654
Have you ever been
in mexico or south america?

25:45.722 --> 25:47.656
Yes.

25:47.724 --> 25:50.826
See, my father was
in the diplomatic corps...

25:50.895 --> 25:54.330
And of course
we traveled extensively
all over the world.

25:54.398 --> 25:57.666
My lord, when I was
growing up I don't think
I was in the same place...

25:57.734 --> 26:01.104
For more than six months
at a time.

26:01.171 --> 26:05.808
<i>Well, the officer's wives,
we're doing a show.
Ooh.</i>

26:05.910 --> 26:10.413
It's sort of a musical revue.
Do you need any dancers?

26:12.516 --> 26:16.619
Thank you.
Cream and sugar?
No, thank you.

26:16.686 --> 26:21.024
You see, we're
on point here.

26:23.027 --> 26:28.864
We've got a nuclear test program
that's become something
of a political football.

26:30.200 --> 26:32.635
And I just don't like to see
us getting kicked around.

26:32.702 --> 26:35.471
Yes, sir.
I appreciate that.

26:35.539 --> 26:37.807
I mean,
if this damn test ban
is ratified, major,

26:37.874 --> 26:41.377
You and me are slated
to be among the first
to get our butts kicked.

26:41.445 --> 26:43.813
As I understand it,
if the test ban is ratified,

26:43.880 --> 26:47.150
We simply abandon atmospheric
tests and go underground.

26:47.217 --> 26:50.987
Given some of the test results
I've been looking at, I think
that's the way to go.

26:51.055 --> 26:54.324
<i>Well, I can
appreciate that.</i>

26:54.391 --> 26:58.661
But we're a team here.
We have to present one
consistent point of view.

26:58.728 --> 27:00.596
You understand that.
You're a soldier.

27:00.664 --> 27:03.299
Yes, sir. I am a soldier
and my duty is science.

27:03.467 --> 27:05.301
Well, I'm just reminding you
that we work for the army,

27:05.369 --> 27:07.603
<i>Not the a.E.C., congress,
or popular science.</i>

27:07.671 --> 27:09.772
You understand?
Yes, sir.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.475
Good. That will be all, major.

27:23.487 --> 27:26.956
<i>If I hadn't gotten married,
I was going to hollywood
for a screen test.</i>

27:27.024 --> 27:30.293
Well, you sure are pretty enough
to be in the movies.

27:30.361 --> 27:33.796
I took ballet too.
Did I tell you?

27:33.864 --> 27:36.632
I just love
getting the flowers
after a performance.

27:36.700 --> 27:40.970
Carly, these are just
the greatest bunch of gals
you'd ever want to know.

27:41.038 --> 27:46.209
Now, they're just
all gonna make you feel
real at home. Come on.

27:50.214 --> 27:53.316
Ladies, help has arrived.

27:58.722 --> 28:00.923
Mom's gonna kill you.
No, she won't.

28:03.494 --> 28:05.928
<i>Let's play a joke on her.
What kind of joke?</i>

28:05.996 --> 28:10.933
We'll both go and lay down
on the living room floor
and pretend we're dead or sick.

28:11.001 --> 28:13.002
Hello. I'm home.

28:16.673 --> 28:18.774
Where's mom?

28:18.842 --> 28:22.011
I don't know.
Probably at the movies.
She didn't leave a note?

28:23.680 --> 28:26.649
Actually, school
was pretty good.

28:27.051 --> 28:31.521
<i>The principal
and his custodial staff
took turns raping me,</i>

28:31.555 --> 28:36.292
While governor wallace himself
stood there and watched
and welcomed us to alabama.

28:36.360 --> 28:40.563
I guess that's what you'd call
southern hospitality.

28:48.539 --> 28:50.473
Oh, daddy's home.

28:50.541 --> 28:53.809
I missed you.
I'm glad to see you.

28:53.877 --> 28:56.579
Sorry I'm late.
Hello, girls.

28:58.014 --> 28:59.798
ta da

28:59.866 --> 29:04.220
<i>I've decided
to become a makeup artist.
My face is my easel.</i>

29:04.588 --> 29:08.157
Honey, you're much too fair
to wear that dark eye shadow and
much too young to wear makeup.

29:08.225 --> 29:10.193
I told you.

29:10.561 --> 29:12.161
Wife, I hope you got
food in those bags.

29:12.229 --> 29:14.430
Oh, I got that and more.

29:14.498 --> 29:18.568
We are gonna have
a party tonight.

29:18.602 --> 29:21.337
<i>Lookee here.</i>

29:24.508 --> 29:26.609
That, my dear, is for you.

29:26.676 --> 29:28.677
Goody.

29:31.115 --> 29:33.182
And for my sweet man.

29:36.353 --> 29:42.024
To replace the one
that was lost in that move
to japan or germany or alaska.

29:42.092 --> 29:44.026
<i>Thanks, mom.</i>

29:44.128 --> 29:46.295
Will you teach me?

29:46.363 --> 29:48.631
As soon as you wash
your pretty little face.

29:48.698 --> 29:53.136
A selmer.
Thank you, sweetheart,
I've been missing a clarinet.

29:53.203 --> 29:57.306
Did you know that your daddy
worked his way through college
playing in a band?

29:57.374 --> 30:00.643
My daddy? No.
Major squarehead?

30:00.710 --> 30:04.947
<i>Oh, yeah.
I found that in a pawn
shop along with-</i>

30:05.149 --> 30:07.716
For alexandra.

30:09.186 --> 30:12.988
It's 'cause you're so smart
and you see things
so clearly and-

30:13.056 --> 30:16.325
Well, you can be
the family historian.
Thank you, mom.

30:16.393 --> 30:18.994
It's got film
and flashbulbs and-

30:19.062 --> 30:21.330
Well, you just pose us
and shoot away.

30:24.668 --> 30:26.769
Mom, what did you get?

30:26.836 --> 30:31.006
I get to make us
a indoor picnic.

30:36.746 --> 30:39.515
All right, now we'll see
who's hot and who's not.

30:39.583 --> 30:41.517
Play us some old bop, pop.

30:52.095 --> 30:54.029
Come on, honey.
Dance with me.

30:54.097 --> 30:56.265
I'll teach you how, okay?

31:03.873 --> 31:07.142
Try this.

31:07.211 --> 31:10.479
Everybody,
say "shit."

31:10.714 --> 31:12.815
<i>Shit.</i>

31:13.183 --> 31:14.783
Enjoy your drinks.

31:14.851 --> 31:18.654
Alex, I've told you young ladies
do not chew gum in public.

31:18.722 --> 31:21.540
I am not a lady,
I'm a teenager.

31:21.725 --> 31:24.893
Teenagers keep
wrigley's in business.
Spit it out.

31:25.229 --> 31:29.365
Carly. A double vodka
martini on the rocks,

31:29.733 --> 31:32.235
<i>Two shirley temples
and vermouth.</i>

31:33.604 --> 31:36.739
- So, where's our host?
- Right over there.

31:38.908 --> 31:41.344
Oh, at ease, major.
This is a party.

31:41.411 --> 31:43.679
Colonel johnson,
I'd like you to meet
my wife carly.

31:43.747 --> 31:46.014
Pleased
to meet you.

31:46.082 --> 31:48.083
How do you do,
colonel?

31:48.252 --> 31:50.353
Carly, hi.
Vera, hi.

31:50.420 --> 31:53.356
Major marshall, it's so good
to meet you at last.

31:53.423 --> 31:56.392
Mrs. Johnson, carly's told me
how kind you've been to her.

31:56.460 --> 31:58.861
Oh, we've been having
so much fun at rehearsals,
haven't we?

31:58.928 --> 32:00.963
<i>I'd like you
to meet my son glenn.</i>

32:01.030 --> 32:03.666
This is mrs. Marshall.
Mrs. Marshall,
how do you do?

32:03.767 --> 32:06.902
Rebecca and alexandra.

32:07.271 --> 32:10.573
You're going to west point
in the fall?
Yes, ma'am, if they'll have me.

32:10.774 --> 32:14.310
They haven't turned down
a johnson in five generations.
They'll be lucky to get you.

32:14.378 --> 32:18.547
I've always said that
vince was born to command
and I was born to demand.

32:18.782 --> 32:22.785
it's lucky you two
found each other.

32:22.786 --> 32:25.655
Would you two like
to play some croquet?
Go on.

32:25.722 --> 32:27.990
Go on, go play.
Okay.

32:28.057 --> 32:31.026
<i>You've got a real bevy
of beauties here, major.
I envy you.</i>

32:31.295 --> 32:34.797
And you are
a flatterer, colonel.

32:35.965 --> 32:37.900
the kids seem
to hit it off real good.

32:38.302 --> 32:41.704
- Alex isn't very shy.
- No, you know she gets
that quality from me.

32:41.805 --> 32:45.341
Lord, you should have seen
when I was pursuing the major.

32:45.409 --> 32:49.278
I just ran him ragged
till I finally let him catch me.

32:50.914 --> 32:53.516
<i>- Hi, girls.
- Hi.</i>

32:53.583 --> 32:56.686
I thought you and mom
were going to another party.
We are.

32:56.753 --> 33:00.289
Mom went over to help
mrs. Johnson with her makeup.

33:00.357 --> 33:05.194
What are you doing?
Probably stay home
and watch tv.

33:07.698 --> 33:10.299
Why don't you go check out
the teen center?

33:10.367 --> 33:13.135
'cause any place
that calls itself
the teen center...

33:13.203 --> 33:15.971
Is probably full of people
who can't make friends.

33:16.039 --> 33:18.974
We've been here two months
and neither one of you
has brought home a friend.

33:19.042 --> 33:21.644
Dad, most of your colleagues
around here...

33:21.845 --> 33:26.014
Are dedicated to a program
of armed nuclear destruction.

33:26.350 --> 33:30.686
<i>I think they're cretins
and that makes their
offspring sub-cretins.</i>

33:30.754 --> 33:33.489
If you have a problem
with sub-cretins, don't sit
at home and complain about it.

33:33.557 --> 33:36.459
Go forth and enlighten them.

33:36.827 --> 33:41.831
Yeah, maybe I'll start the first
teens for test ban club.

33:41.865 --> 33:44.265
<i>That should make me
real popular around here.</i>

33:44.333 --> 33:46.435
Run away from home
and change your name first.

33:47.937 --> 33:50.939
I really
appreciate this, carly.

33:51.006 --> 33:53.775
Oh, I like to do it.

33:53.843 --> 33:57.278
You always look
so stylish.

33:57.346 --> 34:02.050
Women like you
are the reason that men
like women in the first place.

34:02.117 --> 34:04.052
well.

34:04.119 --> 34:08.121
A woman's charm
is mostly illusion
after all.

34:11.126 --> 34:16.063
I suppose we all have
to grow old some day.

34:16.466 --> 34:20.134
I just don't think
you gotta look bad
in the process.

34:24.139 --> 34:28.577
I see these fine
little lines in my face.

34:28.643 --> 34:31.580
They're called wrinkles, honey.
You might as well
get used to it now.

34:31.647 --> 34:36.083
I look in the mirror sometimes
and I see this old woman
lurking there...

34:36.150 --> 34:38.587
Just waiting to grab me.

34:38.654 --> 34:41.790
Oh, I just get so frightened.

34:41.991 --> 34:44.257
Carly, you have
such an active imagination.

34:44.326 --> 34:46.427
I've seen you
in those rehearsals.

34:46.496 --> 34:50.599
Come on, don't you think that
good posture and keeping fit
and keeping active...

34:50.666 --> 34:53.301
Is all a part
of keeping young too?

34:53.503 --> 34:56.004
Maybe if you're a woodpecker.

34:59.341 --> 35:04.513
Welcome to the fort matthews
hail and farewell dance.

35:16.626 --> 35:18.560
Come on and dance with me.
No.

35:18.628 --> 35:20.729
Yes. Yes, you can.
I can't dance.

35:20.796 --> 35:23.197
<i>Major, I'm glad
you could make it.
Yes, sir.</i>

35:23.265 --> 35:25.533
This is ray stevens
from the atomic
energy commission.

35:25.535 --> 35:30.238
I have heard that gentlemen
from the a.E.C. Are much better
dancers than military men.

35:30.305 --> 35:33.975
Is that true?
My husband won't
dance with me.

35:34.043 --> 35:38.246
The only time I really
enjoyed dancing was when
I was in the service.

35:38.313 --> 35:40.248
<i>That was years ago.
Hmm.</i>

35:40.315 --> 35:45.754
It's left up to me to uphold
the honor of the military
on the dance floor.

35:45.821 --> 35:47.556
<i>Shall we?</i>

35:50.159 --> 35:53.261
You two just share some
atomic secrets or something.

35:53.563 --> 35:55.997
I don't know
if I can take this.

35:56.065 --> 35:59.000
Oh, yeah, you can.

35:59.068 --> 36:01.102
You like it.

36:05.575 --> 36:08.543
I didn't risk my ass in guam
so some damn harvard boy...

36:08.611 --> 36:10.545
Could run this country
into the toilet.

36:10.613 --> 36:14.049
If he can't stand up
to the damn communists,
let us do our jobs.

36:14.116 --> 36:18.286
To hell with nevada,
we'll use havana
for a test site.

36:26.596 --> 36:29.230
I know you're
a strong supporter
of underground testing.

36:29.298 --> 36:33.518
Hell, that's only my stated
position in about 30 extremely
obscure reports.

36:33.636 --> 36:38.106
You guys must be burying
those reports deeper
than the moscow subway.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.922
Do you have any children,
mr. Stevens?

36:53.990 --> 36:57.125
Four. I know
what you're thinking.

37:09.639 --> 37:12.206
My oldest daughter wants
to form a test ban club
right here on the base.

37:12.274 --> 37:14.208
Sometimes I feel
that way myself.

37:14.276 --> 37:16.645
Think we ought to join?
No.

37:26.656 --> 37:29.357
You sure?
No.

37:29.424 --> 37:32.827
Let me have another one.

37:33.162 --> 37:37.231
my heart I can't control

37:37.299 --> 37:41.870
you're, oh, my very soul

37:42.171 --> 37:44.388
my only prayer will be

37:44.674 --> 37:47.575
someday you'll care for me

37:47.643 --> 37:51.913
but it's only

37:51.981 --> 37:54.315
make

37:54.684 --> 37:57.318
believe

38:03.092 --> 38:05.093
Uh-oh, here comes
a stop sign.

38:08.430 --> 38:10.364
Time to go, carly.

38:10.432 --> 38:12.366
I want to stay.

38:12.434 --> 38:15.369
This gal's a real dynamo, major.
If we harness her energy,

38:15.437 --> 38:17.939
We won't need reactors.

38:18.941 --> 38:20.875
Come on, daddy.
Dance with me.

38:20.943 --> 38:23.377
Time to go.
Now. Let's go.

38:23.445 --> 38:26.447
Then I'll dance
by myself.

38:58.197 --> 39:00.248
That is an exceptional woman.

39:03.418 --> 39:05.419
No!

39:08.257 --> 39:11.025
Something should
be done about this.

39:11.093 --> 39:16.264
Yeah, well, I can always
requisition another one.

39:17.432 --> 39:19.768
You're a pig.

39:52.634 --> 39:57.738
Well, you know,
when you're just sitting around
and you're not doing anything-

39:57.807 --> 40:00.574
A moment of time
when nothing's happening.

40:00.642 --> 40:02.576
Mm-hmm.

40:02.644 --> 40:08.249
Well, I call that a "noment."

40:08.317 --> 40:12.586
And then when it's
really hot and you're too
lazy to get up and do anything,

40:12.654 --> 40:15.924
Well, I call that
a "sloment."

40:15.991 --> 40:19.327
A "sloment," huh?
What do you call this?

40:21.595 --> 40:23.596
A tongue kiss.

40:30.437 --> 40:32.605
People were
laughing at you.

40:32.774 --> 40:34.607
Oh, just because you never
have any fun doesn't mean...

40:34.675 --> 40:36.709
You have to spend
your entire life ruining mine.

40:36.778 --> 40:39.212
Son of a bitch.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.948
Why is mom all wet?
She had an accident.

41:19.253 --> 41:22.755
Hi, daddy.

42:06.317 --> 42:08.168
<i>Ten hut.</i>

42:08.236 --> 42:10.503
Ten hut.
As you were.

42:10.571 --> 42:13.006
How's it going, hank?
Busy, sir.

42:13.074 --> 42:15.842
Well, you're going
to be a lot busier.

42:15.910 --> 42:18.678
We just got word that some
seismologists in finland
have detected evidence...

42:18.746 --> 42:21.681
That the soviets have detonated
an above-ground device.

42:21.749 --> 42:24.351
The brass must be thrilled.
We're off the bench and back
in the ball game.

42:24.418 --> 42:26.519
You bet your ass we are.

42:26.587 --> 42:30.023
Everything we do from now on
becomes that much more vital.

42:30.091 --> 42:32.025
Those bastards push in
a pile of chips,

42:32.093 --> 42:34.861
We better be able to raise
the bet, right?
Right.

42:34.929 --> 42:40.700
We can maximize
our opportunities
real quick, especially you.

42:40.768 --> 42:44.537
As of 0800 hours Friday,
4, 28, you are t.D.Y.
To operations h.Q...

42:44.605 --> 42:46.539
At the nevada test site
in mercury.

42:46.607 --> 42:49.042
To what do I owe
this honor, sir?

42:49.110 --> 42:53.546
Stevens from the a.E.C.
He was real impressed with you.

42:53.614 --> 42:57.117
You get a clean slate
to start with this time.

43:00.421 --> 43:03.489
I knew vince johnson
wasn't such a bad guy.

43:03.557 --> 43:05.491
This is a real
vote of confidence in your-

43:05.559 --> 43:08.494
Carly, do you
remember your bible?

43:08.562 --> 43:13.166
Of course I remember my bible.
You know grandpa was a preacher.

43:13.234 --> 43:18.071
All right. How did
david steal bathsheba
away from her husband?

43:20.408 --> 43:23.743
He bought her a drink.
No, silly.

43:25.746 --> 43:30.917
He sent her husband away
into battle where he was killed.
Second samuel, verse 15.

43:30.952 --> 43:32.919
Monsieur, your car
is waiting.

43:32.954 --> 43:36.756
Tell him I'll be
right- right there.

43:39.593 --> 43:42.762
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

43:44.765 --> 43:48.701
The only thing that ever
happens to me is that I just-

43:48.769 --> 43:50.937
I miss you too much.

43:57.778 --> 44:00.480
Do you really have to be gone
for two whole weeks?

44:00.547 --> 44:02.482
Yes, I do, baby.

44:02.549 --> 44:05.986
Well, that's enough time
for you to convince them
to abandon nuclear weapons.

44:06.053 --> 44:07.988
Yes, it is.
You bet.

44:08.055 --> 44:09.990
Ooh, daddy.
What?

44:10.057 --> 44:13.493
Will you call me every night
just before I go to bed?

44:13.560 --> 44:15.495
No, it's too expensive.

44:15.562 --> 44:17.563
of course, I will.

44:18.565 --> 44:20.500
I love you.
I love you too.

44:20.567 --> 44:22.568
<i>Bye, daddy, bye.
Be good.</i>

44:48.595 --> 44:50.863
Hundred sixty
millimeter mortars...

44:50.931 --> 44:52.865
About the strength
of two hand grenades.

44:52.933 --> 44:55.035
Don't worry though.
They're all spent.

44:55.102 --> 44:59.272
They used
to train g.I.S back here
in the second world war.

45:05.046 --> 45:07.147
You can't tell anybody
about this place.

45:07.214 --> 45:09.382
Never.

45:10.717 --> 45:12.985
I like it.

45:13.054 --> 45:15.488
I wouldn't want
to live here, but...

45:15.556 --> 45:17.490
It's nice.

45:17.558 --> 45:20.060
It's private.

45:21.895 --> 45:24.497
Let's get hitched
and live here forever.

45:24.565 --> 45:29.202
To an army man?
They're too weird.

45:29.570 --> 45:35.007
Last year, colonel harris
took his family to nevada
to watch the a-bomb go off.

45:35.076 --> 45:37.009
That was their vacation.

45:37.078 --> 45:39.512
<i>Look, I'm not ashamed
of what they're doing.</i>

45:39.580 --> 45:42.515
I mean,
the manhattan project
ended the last war.

45:42.583 --> 45:45.185
Maybe project blue sky
will prevent the next one.

45:45.252 --> 45:47.220
Do you know why
they call it blue sky?

45:47.588 --> 45:50.690
They're gonna detonate
a big one underground
to track radiation.

45:50.757 --> 45:53.693
But you can't see radiation,

45:53.760 --> 45:57.197
You can't feel it
or taste it or smell it.

45:57.264 --> 46:00.133
So only a handful of people will
actually know where it is...

46:00.201 --> 46:03.603
And the rest of the country
could be swimming in the stuff,

46:03.604 --> 46:06.739
But for all they know
the sky is just
as blue as ever.

46:07.108 --> 46:09.609
Yeah, well, what
they don't know
won't hurt them.

46:12.045 --> 46:15.482
No wonder west point
snapped you up.

46:15.549 --> 46:19.152
And if I married you,
I'd end up just like my mom.

46:19.220 --> 46:21.887
Yeah, you talk gibberish
sometimes, alex.

46:27.394 --> 46:30.079
- Catch.
- No!

46:34.635 --> 46:36.302
What the hell was that?

46:36.370 --> 46:38.505
They weren't supposed
to start maneuvers
for another two weeks.

46:38.572 --> 46:41.274
Well, maybe them cubans
sprung a sneak attack.

46:50.166 --> 46:53.001
Jesus.
Let's get the hell
out of here.

47:30.973 --> 47:33.809
<i>What in the hell are you
doing here, mister?</i>

47:48.325 --> 47:50.492
What do you know?
What's happening?

47:56.499 --> 48:00.202
Calm down, calm down.
Everything's under control.
It's all right.

48:00.269 --> 48:03.205
Alex, honey, are you okay?

48:03.272 --> 48:06.709
Vince, I think we gotta take
him to the hospital it looks
like he needs stitches.

48:06.776 --> 48:08.877
<i>Let's see.
And he needs a swift kick
in the butt even more.</i>

48:08.945 --> 48:10.879
Are you hurt?
No.

48:10.947 --> 48:12.881
<i>Excuse me, I'd like
to apologize for my son.</i>

48:12.949 --> 48:16.218
I'm afraid he was off-limits
with your daughter.

48:16.285 --> 48:18.554
Well, boys will be boys.

48:18.621 --> 48:23.225
Yeah. I'd like
this area secured now.
Nobody goes in or out.

48:23.292 --> 48:25.361
<i>Go home, everybody.
The show's over.</i>

48:27.296 --> 48:30.065
<i>I want to know what you
were doing up there.</i>

48:30.132 --> 48:34.069
Just what you told me to do.
Making friends with glenn.

48:34.136 --> 48:37.740
I want to know exactly
what the two of you
were doing up there.

48:37.807 --> 48:39.975
What do you mean by "exactly"?

48:40.343 --> 48:44.646
Well, was an old grenade
the only thing that went off?

48:44.881 --> 48:47.249
I can't believe you.
You don't even care about me.

48:47.316 --> 48:49.251
You just want to know
about all the sex stuff!

48:49.318 --> 48:52.421
Don't you sass me, sister!
I am not your sister!

48:52.489 --> 48:56.825
Well, if I had a sister,
I would tell her everything!

49:03.266 --> 49:07.369
Especially... About boys.

49:07.437 --> 49:09.438
Ew, boys.

49:29.426 --> 49:31.059
What are you-
what are you doing here?

49:31.127 --> 49:34.530
I've come to kidnap you
and take you to the woods.
I left my knife at the bungalow.

49:34.931 --> 49:37.733
<i>Will you come with?
Glenn, that place
is dangerous.</i>

49:37.801 --> 49:41.236
<i>- Not anymore.
My dad had it cleaned up.
- If my mom finds out-</i>

49:41.304 --> 49:44.239
She's gonna be at rehearsal
for hours. Come on.

49:44.307 --> 49:47.075
I've gotta finish up
my chores.

49:47.143 --> 49:49.745
<i>All right,
but I gotta help.
That's what I'm here for.</i>

49:49.813 --> 49:52.147
Okay, come in.
All right.

49:53.316 --> 49:55.951
Wait. Come back here.

50:08.465 --> 50:10.933
come in, rad two. Over.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.102
Base station, this is
rad site two. Over.

50:14.170 --> 50:16.972
Rad two,
hold your place.

50:19.008 --> 50:21.443
This underground stuff
is not like the old days.

50:21.511 --> 50:23.779
Look at all this junk.

50:23.847 --> 50:27.950
Hell, at bikini, you could
feel the wind from the blast
through the atmosphere.

50:28.017 --> 50:31.787
Flying particles
as big as corn flakes.

50:31.855 --> 50:33.789
We're coming up
on 60 seconds, sir.

50:33.857 --> 50:37.425
all cameras report.
Ground cameras, report. Over.

50:37.494 --> 50:39.862
camera one ready.

50:41.998 --> 50:43.899
camera two ready.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.001
camera three ready.

50:46.002 --> 50:49.504
<i>- Camera four ready.
- Camera five ready.</i>

50:49.506 --> 50:55.176
...Forty-seven, forty-six
forty-five, forty-four-

50:55.512 --> 50:59.147
nuclear underground test
number 001, clear and counting.

50:59.215 --> 51:03.251
All systems green.
All safeties are off and ready.

51:03.319 --> 51:08.089
All personnel
in position and holding.
Standing by.

51:08.157 --> 51:11.159
Final lock position
procedure complete.

51:12.228 --> 51:15.531
What the hell is that?
Let's take a peek.

51:18.001 --> 51:21.469
...Twenty, nineteen, eighteen,

51:21.538 --> 51:23.471
Base station,
this is rad site two,

51:23.540 --> 51:26.474
We have two civilians
on horseback heading
right towards site.

51:26.543 --> 51:30.211
<i>- Punch up a camera
on those cowboys.
- Base station, base station.</i>

51:30.547 --> 51:32.147
We gotta get
them out of there.
Please advise.

51:32.549 --> 51:35.651
we cannot detonate.
Abort the test!

51:36.019 --> 51:38.103
<i>- It's too late.
- ...Three, two, detonation.</i>

51:42.559 --> 51:44.560
it's venting!

51:49.198 --> 51:51.399
Radiation's
right off the scale.

51:51.568 --> 51:53.468
Base station,
this is rad site two.

51:53.536 --> 51:55.571
We have massive radiation
venting in sector four.

51:57.574 --> 52:01.810
Rad two, return to base.
Rad two, return to base.

52:26.102 --> 52:27.769
General, sir,
we gotta find those guys.

52:27.837 --> 52:29.771
The fox has left
the henhouse, major.

52:29.839 --> 52:32.440
I beg the general's pardon,
we are not talking
about chickens, sir.

52:32.508 --> 52:34.442
We're talking
about human lives.

52:34.510 --> 52:39.798
These things happen, major.
Every tv station and every
radio station in this state...

52:39.865 --> 52:42.801
Was notified of this test.
They were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

52:42.868 --> 52:46.855
I beg the general's pardon,
but that is bullshit.
Those men have been cooked.

52:47.123 --> 52:49.124
There's ways
to handle it, major.

52:49.191 --> 52:51.459
We'll be notifying the local
medical authorities.

52:51.628 --> 52:54.295
These men will
come in for treatment.
They'll be taken care of.

52:54.363 --> 52:57.499
<i>- Very good, if they're alive.
- Goddamn it, marshall.
We've gotta keep a lid on it.</i>

52:57.634 --> 53:01.637
There will be no
talk about this, major.
You can't even tell your dog.

53:06.308 --> 53:08.810
Back away from the door, hank.

53:14.316 --> 53:16.317
Let's go have a drink.

53:21.824 --> 53:24.760
It's criminal.
They should be found.
Right.

53:24.827 --> 53:27.929
No, it's a crime.
Right, they should,
but we can't.

53:27.997 --> 53:32.267
So forget it.
They're exposed.

53:32.635 --> 53:35.103
It's too late to do
anything for them, pal.
It's too damn late.

53:35.171 --> 53:39.107
Jimmy, I have dedicated my life
to counting alpha particles...

53:39.175 --> 53:41.643
And beta particles
and gamma rays.

53:41.678 --> 53:46.982
I monitor radio iodine levels,
I calculate isotopic
half-lives-

53:47.183 --> 53:50.285
Things you can't see
or hear or feel,

53:50.352 --> 53:52.954
Things unknowable
to the common man...

53:53.022 --> 53:56.792
Who winds up dead as shit.

53:56.859 --> 53:58.794
It's a crime.

53:58.861 --> 54:02.297
<i>Your work's done here.
Forget about it.</i>

54:04.466 --> 54:09.705
It's a goddamn crime,
and I am going to forget
precisely nothing...

54:12.975 --> 54:16.411
And no one.

54:16.478 --> 54:18.479
<i>Fayrene, two more.</i>

54:23.918 --> 54:27.021
Bravo.
Good night, ladies.

54:27.088 --> 54:29.523
Good night.
Good night.

54:29.590 --> 54:32.192
Good night, girls.
I am so hot.

54:35.096 --> 54:37.031
Uh-oh, here she goes.

54:37.098 --> 54:39.366
<i>Oh, next year
we should do gypsy.</i>

54:39.433 --> 54:41.702
Yeah, wouldn't our husbands
just love that.

54:41.770 --> 54:44.371
God, I could
never do that.
Good night.

54:57.786 --> 54:59.720
Good night.

54:59.788 --> 55:01.722
<i>Good night.</i>

55:06.561 --> 55:10.698
You know, I bet you really
could have been in movies.

55:12.233 --> 55:16.904
<i>I wanted that.
I really did.</i>

55:21.242 --> 55:24.845
You know, sometimes I think
I could just disappear...

55:25.213 --> 55:27.681
And no one would ever
know I'd been here.

55:27.749 --> 55:31.351
That's why we have children,
and mine need tucking up
about now.

55:31.419 --> 55:34.088
You want a ride?

55:45.734 --> 55:48.936
No.
Okay.

56:16.064 --> 56:18.165
If the show is as good
as the rehearsal,

56:18.233 --> 56:21.268
You got a hit.

56:23.238 --> 56:25.239
How's glenn?

56:26.241 --> 56:28.909
He's okay.

56:31.412 --> 56:35.282
You know, that routine might
be a little risque for the base.

56:35.349 --> 56:37.784
<i>It might overexcite
some of the men.</i>

56:37.786 --> 56:43.190
I thought men joined the army
looking for adventure.

56:43.258 --> 56:46.693
You've been watching
too many war movies.

56:46.761 --> 56:50.297
I hate war movies.

56:53.434 --> 56:56.369
<i>I need your help.</i>

56:56.437 --> 56:59.807
Zip me up.

57:09.550 --> 57:14.822
You know,
zipping you up...

57:14.889 --> 57:17.991
Is not exactly
what I had in mind.

57:18.059 --> 57:20.660
No?

57:20.728 --> 57:22.729
No.

57:30.738 --> 57:32.739
No.

57:34.408 --> 57:37.244
Meet me outside.

58:30.899 --> 58:33.000
Glenn, maybe this
isn't such a good idea.

58:33.067 --> 58:36.403
It's all right.

58:58.592 --> 59:01.028
Come on, let's go.
Let's just go.

59:02.931 --> 59:06.733
Oh, my god.
Oh, don't you-

59:06.935 --> 59:10.938
Come on, let's go.
Get away from me!

59:17.511 --> 59:20.179
alex, open the door.
I'm gonna tell him.

59:20.548 --> 59:22.181
Alex, please.

59:22.249 --> 59:26.485
<i>Please what?
Please talk to me or
please don't tell daddy?</i>

59:26.554 --> 59:29.522
<i>You're not even sorry
for what you did, are you?</i>

59:29.590 --> 59:31.991
You're just afraid
of getting caught!

59:32.059 --> 59:34.627
That's not true.

59:34.695 --> 59:39.566
<i>how could you
do this to him?</i>

59:39.633 --> 59:41.568
<i>Everybody's
gonna find out.</i>

59:41.635 --> 59:45.638
<i>If I don't tell him,
they're all gonna laugh
at him behind his back.</i>

59:48.075 --> 59:49.943
I hate you!

59:56.083 --> 59:58.150
I'm gonna tell him.

59:59.587 --> 01:00:01.588
When?

01:00:08.228 --> 01:00:10.162
Operator.

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:13.332
Long distance, please.
City and state, please.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.770
Mercury, nevada. 7458.

01:00:17.838 --> 01:00:19.939
One moment, please.

01:00:25.913 --> 01:00:27.847
a.E.C., mercury.

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:30.750
Major hank marshall, please.

01:00:33.621 --> 01:00:36.756
call for major marshall,
line one.

01:00:36.824 --> 01:00:39.191
Line one, major marshall.

01:00:44.598 --> 01:00:46.733
this is hank marshall!

01:00:47.101 --> 01:00:48.868
Hank?

01:00:53.507 --> 01:00:58.678
Daddy, when are you
coming home?

01:00:58.746 --> 01:01:02.615
Sweetheart, you're gonna
have to speak up!
I can barely hear ya!

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:09.555
I have to-

01:01:11.792 --> 01:01:17.630
I have to tell you something,
and it's hard for me to-

01:01:17.665 --> 01:01:20.166
What is it, baby?
I can't hear!

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:27.073
After rehearsal... Tonight,

01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:30.677
Vince johnson drove me home.

01:01:33.647 --> 01:01:35.481
And-

01:01:35.683 --> 01:01:39.185
I can't hear you, baby!
I'm sorry! You're gonna have
to speak up now really loud!

01:01:39.252 --> 01:01:41.754
Wait a minute!
I'll try to find
a different line!

01:01:45.793 --> 01:01:47.960
I said...

01:01:48.195 --> 01:01:53.132
After rehearsal tonight,
vince johnson drove me home!

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.402
vince johnson drove me home.

01:01:56.469 --> 01:01:58.905
Just a mistake, daddy.

01:02:02.943 --> 01:02:04.944
And-

01:02:06.213 --> 01:02:09.982
I-I- I can't-

01:02:41.248 --> 01:02:43.282
<i>Hi, daddy!
Hello, baby!</i>

01:02:46.253 --> 01:02:48.387
She's at the officers' club.

01:02:48.756 --> 01:02:50.556
Tonight's the show.

01:02:51.759 --> 01:02:54.127
Oh, lord, where is she?

01:02:54.194 --> 01:02:56.763
Check the motels.

01:02:56.830 --> 01:02:59.531
Ah, here she comes.
Lock up your husbands, girls.

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:09.608
<i>Hello.
Boy, am I nervous.</i>

01:03:09.676 --> 01:03:12.178
<i>I just hope I don't
trip or something.
Don't' worry.</i>

01:03:12.246 --> 01:03:14.380
We've been practicing
for weeks.
You'll be fine.

01:03:14.447 --> 01:03:17.083
What have you got
to be worried about?
I'm the one with two left feet.

01:03:17.151 --> 01:03:21.720
Hey, why don't you girls
come over to my house for
some dinner after the show?

01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:24.223
Sounds great.
I could use a break
from the kids.

01:03:24.291 --> 01:03:26.292
Can I talk with you,
vera?

01:03:26.359 --> 01:03:30.329
Why? Sit down
and have a drink...

01:03:30.397 --> 01:03:33.699
And go over
the gory details?

01:03:33.767 --> 01:03:37.837
The things you like
to share with friends.

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:44.677
People like you
come and go, carly.

01:03:44.744 --> 01:03:49.348
You mean just one less
christmas card to me.

01:03:49.416 --> 01:03:51.818
five minutes, ladies.

01:03:51.885 --> 01:03:53.820
Can I still do
my number?

01:03:53.887 --> 01:03:57.723
Oh, my god.
Is that all you can think of?

01:03:57.791 --> 01:04:00.843
musicians, places, please.

01:04:17.410 --> 01:04:20.346
All my life,
people have told lies about me.

01:04:24.084 --> 01:04:27.386
Even when I was little,

01:04:27.454 --> 01:04:30.122
Other girls used
to make up stories.

01:04:45.372 --> 01:04:47.406
fernando's hideaway

01:05:00.988 --> 01:05:03.890
fernando's hideaway

01:05:08.395 --> 01:05:10.863
At least one of them's
got nice legs.

01:05:16.603 --> 01:05:18.737
fernando's hideaway

01:05:26.746 --> 01:05:28.680
I need to talk to you.

01:05:28.748 --> 01:05:31.817
Later, marshall.
Now. I need to
talk to you right now.

01:05:31.919 --> 01:05:34.920
<i>- It's not the time to-
- I need to talk to you
right fucking now.</i>

01:05:50.337 --> 01:05:52.271
This is a personal matter.
Don't you think we oughta
discuss this-

01:05:52.339 --> 01:05:54.440
It's not personal.
It has to do with blue sky.

01:05:55.208 --> 01:05:58.945
fernando's hideaway
ole

01:06:09.957 --> 01:06:12.958
Look, I'm not gonna
talk about this shit...

01:06:13.025 --> 01:06:15.160
With you now or any other time,
all right?

01:06:15.228 --> 01:06:18.731
Colonel johnson, 48 hours ago,
we irradiated 2 people
in mercury, nevada,

01:06:18.865 --> 01:06:21.366
Who are now facing blindness,
leukemia and bone cancer.

01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:23.836
<i>One more word, mister,
and I'll see you
court-martialed.</i>

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:25.838
hank! Hank!
You don't have
the balls for that.

01:06:25.905 --> 01:06:29.875
You're just jealous
because you can't
satisfy that nympho.

01:06:30.877 --> 01:06:33.379
Hank!

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.482
Hank!

01:06:52.599 --> 01:06:54.733
Oh, god.

01:06:56.536 --> 01:06:58.637
I just hurt all over.

01:07:02.909 --> 01:07:05.076
Maybe we can
call it even, daddy.

01:07:05.144 --> 01:07:07.279
I doubt it.

01:07:07.346 --> 01:07:09.848
We've done
too much damage
to each other.

01:07:12.051 --> 01:07:14.887
I'm the one all bandaged up.

01:07:14.954 --> 01:07:19.758
I can't even imagine
what it's gonna look like.

01:07:19.826 --> 01:07:22.093
I always loved
looking at you.

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:27.132
I even enjoyed
other men looking at you.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.108
But you always take
everything right over
the edge, don't you?

01:07:45.452 --> 01:07:48.787
It didn't mean anything.
You know that.

01:07:50.457 --> 01:07:53.692
Oh, I know
it didn't mean anything.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.462
Just like
all the other times.

01:08:00.467 --> 01:08:03.735
But it meant a lot to me.

01:08:12.411 --> 01:08:16.682
I don't know how much longer
I can go on. I'm tired.

01:08:22.856 --> 01:08:24.990
I'm real tired.

01:08:33.131 --> 01:08:35.501
I gotta go see
about the girls.

01:08:52.752 --> 01:08:56.154
She's gonna be fine.
Doctor says she can
come home in two days.

01:08:58.925 --> 01:09:02.594
Lydia, will you take
the girls home, please?

01:09:02.662 --> 01:09:04.962
<i>go on.</i>

01:09:11.404 --> 01:09:13.470
At ease.

01:09:19.495 --> 01:09:22.747
Mrs. Marshall,
this can't come off
for another week,

01:09:22.814 --> 01:09:24.783
And it'll heal up
just fine.

01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:28.086
In a few weeks, you'll
need a magnifying glass
just to see it.

01:09:28.154 --> 01:09:33.191
I'm gonna need dark makeup
and heavy lisle stockings
for the rest of my life.

01:09:33.259 --> 01:09:35.928
Now, now,
you just relax.

01:09:35.995 --> 01:09:38.129
You've got a visitor
coming up.

01:09:39.465 --> 01:09:42.067
Who?
I don't know.

01:09:49.075 --> 01:09:50.975
Brought you some flowers.

01:09:51.044 --> 01:09:53.528
Thanks.

01:10:00.086 --> 01:10:03.188
Hank's in big trouble.

01:10:03.539 --> 01:10:05.557
You should know that,
carly.

01:10:09.195 --> 01:10:13.031
Well, this whole thing,
it doesn't... Look good
for anyone.

01:10:13.099 --> 01:10:17.502
It's real... Messy,
and I like to keep
a clean base.

01:10:19.271 --> 01:10:21.372
Besides, I-

01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:26.578
Well, I feel...
Personally responsible.

01:10:29.616 --> 01:10:31.917
We're both responsible.

01:10:42.729 --> 01:10:45.363
You don't know...

01:10:45.431 --> 01:10:47.666
How much I need him.

01:10:49.869 --> 01:10:53.138
Nobody understands that.

01:10:57.343 --> 01:10:59.645
Well,

01:11:00.479 --> 01:11:02.748
<i>There is...</i>

01:11:02.815 --> 01:11:05.083
<i>One way we could
get him out.</i>

01:11:05.151 --> 01:11:07.218
Maybe.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.683
Daddy, I brought
some good news.

01:11:39.686 --> 01:11:45.157
Vince johnson
has figured out a way
to help us out of all this.

01:11:45.224 --> 01:11:47.292
He had me
sign some papers...

01:11:47.643 --> 01:11:51.797
To put you in the hospital
for just a couple weeks,

01:11:51.864 --> 01:11:56.702
Just for observation,
and then the whole thing
is written off to stress.

01:11:58.004 --> 01:12:00.305
You've had me committed?

01:12:00.656 --> 01:12:04.309
No! No!
It's not as bad as it sounds.

01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:07.179
It's hardly gonna affect
your record at all.

01:12:07.246 --> 01:12:11.049
Is that
what he told you?
Yes.
That's what he told me.

01:12:11.117 --> 01:12:14.119
He also told me...

01:12:14.187 --> 01:12:17.856
That the only other alternative
would be a court-martial.

01:12:17.924 --> 01:12:21.226
A court-martial is what
I wanted. It's my only chance
to tell what really happened.

01:12:21.227 --> 01:12:25.063
A court-martial would mean
eight years in prison, he said.

01:12:25.231 --> 01:12:27.966
It would mean
a dishonorable discharge.

01:12:28.034 --> 01:12:32.303
No pension, no transfer,
no nothing.

01:12:35.742 --> 01:12:40.045
Darling,
this is a setup.

01:12:40.246 --> 01:12:42.781
<i>We've been set up.</i>

01:12:50.089 --> 01:12:53.925
Major, we have orders
remanding you to base hospital.
Let me see them.

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:56.461
This was a verbal authorization
from colonel johnson, sir.

01:12:56.528 --> 01:12:58.563
<i>All right.
Get me somebody from
adjutant general's office.</i>

01:12:58.765 --> 01:13:02.000
Our orders are to remove you
from base stockade
and remand you to b.G.H.

01:13:02.068 --> 01:13:04.903
Get me somebody from
the adjutant general's office,
then I'll consider moving.

01:13:04.971 --> 01:13:07.155
Consider this, sir.
You either stand up now,

01:13:07.306 --> 01:13:11.042
Or we'll drag your ass out of
here so fast your butt won't
say good-bye to your shorts.

01:13:11.277 --> 01:13:13.145
Do I make myself clear, sir?

01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:40.071
Major hank marshall.
Which room is he in?

01:13:40.089 --> 01:13:42.656
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
He's not allowed visitors.
- No. I'm his wife.

01:13:42.924 --> 01:13:45.926
I'm mrs. Marshall.
Of course I can see him.

01:13:47.862 --> 01:13:51.264
Mrs. Marshall, there are
procedures to be followed
in the hospital.

01:13:51.433 --> 01:13:54.167
Well, how long do
those procedures take?

01:13:54.235 --> 01:13:56.670
About two weeks.

01:13:56.738 --> 01:13:58.672
Two weeks? For what?

01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:03.376
We're doing everything
we possibly can
for major marshall.
Right.

01:14:03.445 --> 01:14:08.615
And I'm jackie kennedy,
and flying saucers
just stole my dog.

01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:11.051
<i>But I don't want
to see him there.</i>

01:14:11.118 --> 01:14:13.153
Daddy will be home soon.

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:17.758
It's taken me two weeks
to get permission
to visit him.

01:14:17.826 --> 01:14:21.027
Now, he's gonna need a hug
from his little baby.

01:14:21.095 --> 01:14:23.029
Besides, there's nothing
to be scared of.

01:14:23.097 --> 01:14:27.801
It's a hospital,
but he's not sick
or anything like that.

01:14:27.869 --> 01:14:29.837
Besides,
we're gonna have a-

01:14:29.904 --> 01:14:33.607
We're gonna have
a picnic. Now-

01:14:33.675 --> 01:14:36.977
You're not even dressed!
Go on! Get dressed!

01:14:37.044 --> 01:14:38.979
I don't want to be late.

01:14:39.046 --> 01:14:43.283
You want me
to fix your hair?
I can do it myself.

01:14:45.286 --> 01:14:48.755
Okay.
Daddy likes mayonnaise.

01:14:49.891 --> 01:14:51.925
Daddy likes
a little pepper.

01:14:51.993 --> 01:14:54.495
Now, everyone here
is under temporary sedation,

01:14:54.562 --> 01:14:56.563
So don't be alarmed,
mrs. Marshall.

01:14:56.631 --> 01:14:59.165
His condition
can change instantly.

01:15:05.974 --> 01:15:08.008
Daddy!

01:15:22.023 --> 01:15:24.525
I ma- I ma- I ma- I ma-

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:28.862
I made-

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:32.032
Made these for us?

01:15:35.036 --> 01:15:37.771
They al-almost...

01:15:38.039 --> 01:15:40.541
Done.

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:55.556
Alex, you go after your sister.

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:07.768
Hi, daddy.

01:16:11.439 --> 01:16:13.473
I brought you a picnic.

01:16:15.677 --> 01:16:19.546
I bet you could use
some good coffee, huh?

01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:28.855
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:16:28.923 --> 01:16:31.140
Uh! Damn!

01:16:32.594 --> 01:16:35.996
<i>he's a nuclear engineer,
for christ's sake!</i>

01:16:36.097 --> 01:16:38.164
They got him making wallets!
How can they do this to him?
They?

01:16:38.232 --> 01:16:40.233
You! You did this!

01:16:40.301 --> 01:16:42.502
Stop it!
It's your fault!

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:50.744
What are you doing?

01:16:52.279 --> 01:16:54.648
Just wiping off
the ice cream.

01:17:04.125 --> 01:17:07.293
welcome to the fort matthews
memorial day parade.

01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:10.030
Participating in our
memorial day parade...

01:17:10.131 --> 01:17:13.533
Is the maxwell air force base
drill team and color guard.

01:17:13.635 --> 01:17:16.637
Fort matthews is
under the command of
colonel vincent p. Johnson.

01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:24.144
Joining the military band,
we have the selma high
drum and bugle corps.

01:17:25.146 --> 01:17:27.347
Today we are
honored to have...

01:17:27.414 --> 01:17:30.383
Local veterans of
the first world war on hand.

01:17:30.652 --> 01:17:34.621
Let's have a big
round of applause for
our patriotic doughboys.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.794
Coming onto
the parade ground next...

01:17:41.162 --> 01:17:43.830
Is our fine pratville high
marching band,

01:17:44.165 --> 01:17:46.166
Playing "host of freedom."

01:17:52.173 --> 01:17:54.675
They can't do this to daddy.

01:17:57.211 --> 01:17:59.179
Mom, what are you doing?

01:18:05.687 --> 01:18:09.690
You will burn in hell,
you lying son of a bitch!

01:18:11.192 --> 01:18:12.859
You lying son of a bitch!

01:18:13.194 --> 01:18:15.929
You think craziness
is hereditary?

01:18:15.997 --> 01:18:18.031
<i>I don't know,</i>

01:18:18.199 --> 01:18:22.002
But it's not exactly
something we could
ask either one of them.

01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:24.938
Mommy,
what are we gonna do?

01:18:27.909 --> 01:18:30.643
Here's yesterday's mail.

01:18:30.712 --> 01:18:34.214
There's a letter here
for dad from nevada.

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:02.108
Daddy.

01:20:16.282 --> 01:20:19.719
Alex! Alex!
Alex, wake up.

01:20:19.786 --> 01:20:22.521
Becky! Becky, get up.

01:20:22.589 --> 01:20:24.523
Quickly!
Come on, girls.

01:20:24.591 --> 01:20:27.492
Get up.
We're going on a trip.
Hurry up. Pack a bag.

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.528
Help your sister.
Get up!

01:20:29.596 --> 01:20:32.531
<i>It's the middle of the night.
We'll beat the traffic.</i>

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:41.506
Thank you.

01:20:41.574 --> 01:20:45.677
Girls, wake up!
I got some breakfast.

01:20:45.746 --> 01:20:47.679
Eat up.

01:20:47.748 --> 01:20:49.749
oh

01:20:49.816 --> 01:20:54.186
sometimes I get
a good feeling, yeah

01:20:54.254 --> 01:20:57.489
something's got
a hold on me, yeah

01:20:57.557 --> 01:20:59.524
oh, it must be love

01:20:59.592 --> 01:21:04.130
oh, something's got a hold
on me right now, child

01:21:04.197 --> 01:21:06.132
oh, it must be love

01:21:06.199 --> 01:21:08.734
let me tell you now
I've got a feeling

01:21:08.802 --> 01:21:10.736
I feel so strange

01:21:10.804 --> 01:21:14.006
everything about me
seems to have changed

01:21:14.074 --> 01:21:17.910
<i>step by step
mom, let's stop. Please?</i>

01:21:17.978 --> 01:21:20.246
no, baby.
We're not gonna stop.

01:21:20.313 --> 01:21:22.381
<i>we haven't slept
in two days.</i>

01:21:22.448 --> 01:21:24.483
I just can't sleep
till I get daddy out.

01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:28.587
oh, hey, hey, yeah

01:21:28.655 --> 01:21:31.891
oh, it must be love
you know it must be love

01:21:31.958 --> 01:21:36.428
let me tell you now
something's got a hold
on me, yeah

01:21:36.496 --> 01:21:38.430
oh, it must be love

01:21:38.498 --> 01:21:43.002
oh, something's got a hold
on me right now, child

01:21:43.069 --> 01:21:45.070
oh, it must be love

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.774
What are you gonna
say to 'em?

01:21:48.842 --> 01:21:52.377
You can't just
walk up and say, "hello.
My name is carly marshall,

01:21:52.445 --> 01:21:54.579
And you've been
contaminated."

01:21:54.647 --> 01:21:59.551
How about, "howdy, howdy.
Sure is nice to meet
some real cowboys."

01:21:59.619 --> 01:22:02.721
Didn't think there were
any of them left.
Maybe there aren't.

01:22:02.789 --> 01:22:06.926
Maybe they're
already dead.

01:22:06.993 --> 01:22:08.994
Oh, shut up.

01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:19.839
hello there?

01:22:38.424 --> 01:22:41.861
There's a lady out there.
She wants to talk to you.

01:22:44.865 --> 01:22:47.199
My wife tells me
you're concerned
with our health.

01:22:47.267 --> 01:22:53.072
Well, yes, I am.
Of course I am, but
mostly it's my husband.

01:22:53.373 --> 01:22:56.541
You see, he was in
a helicopter that day.
He saw it.

01:22:56.609 --> 01:23:01.180
- He tried to stop the test,
but it was too late.
- What's done is done.

01:23:01.381 --> 01:23:05.084
The army, they're drugging him
and holding him against his will
in some mental hospital.

01:23:05.385 --> 01:23:08.153
<i>But you can help me.</i>

01:23:08.388 --> 01:23:11.023
How can we do that?

01:23:11.391 --> 01:23:14.960
I was just hoping that
you would come with me
to the newspapers.

01:23:15.028 --> 01:23:17.329
You see, you could
tell them just how sick
you've been...

01:23:17.397 --> 01:23:21.267
And how nobody,
nobody even bothered
to come by here...

01:23:21.334 --> 01:23:23.269
And explain to you
what had happened.

01:23:23.403 --> 01:23:25.837
They would have
to understand that
my husband's not crazy.

01:23:25.906 --> 01:23:28.040
<i>He's not crazy at all.
Don't believe
we could do that.</i>

01:23:28.408 --> 01:23:32.011
It's true.
She's telling you the truth.

01:23:32.412 --> 01:23:36.415
It ain't our way.
We don't like
to make a fuss.

01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:40.485
That's right. 'sides,
there's gonna be
another one tomorrow.

01:23:40.553 --> 01:23:42.721
For tomorrow morning,
about 10:00, 10:30, right?

01:23:42.789 --> 01:23:44.990
I'll tell you what.
We're gonna be out here
working, right, nick?

01:23:45.058 --> 01:23:47.726
<i>If my government tells me
there's no danger,</i>

01:23:47.794 --> 01:23:49.728
Then, by god,
I got to believe them.

01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:53.732
Why, that-
I don't mean to be rude,
but that is so stupid.

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:57.769
That is just plain stupid.

01:23:57.938 --> 01:24:00.139
Mom, why don't we go?

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:05.744
Take this lady
back to the house
and tell her good-bye.

01:24:05.946 --> 01:24:08.047
Come on, sweetie.

01:24:08.448 --> 01:24:10.149
He's the boss.

01:24:10.216 --> 01:24:13.385
Good luck.

01:24:13.453 --> 01:24:17.990
we've got
the pilot's letter and
we've got dad's reports.

01:24:18.058 --> 01:24:21.493
Why don't we go
to the newspapers
without the cowboys?

01:24:21.561 --> 01:24:25.097
That's all we really need,
isn't it?

01:24:25.165 --> 01:24:27.232
Mom?

01:24:41.547 --> 01:24:43.648
Mom?

01:24:48.688 --> 01:24:51.023
Mom?

01:24:51.091 --> 01:24:53.392
Alex. Alex, wake up.

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:56.628
Alex, mom's gone.

01:25:32.532 --> 01:25:35.033
welcome to
our underground bunker.

01:25:35.035 --> 01:25:38.570
This is our test site today.

01:25:38.638 --> 01:25:41.240
The tower is used
to drill deep enough...

01:25:41.307 --> 01:25:43.542
To place the device
securely underground.

01:25:43.609 --> 01:25:46.311
The cables you see are linked
to monitor and record...

01:25:46.546 --> 01:25:49.548
Every reaction
the material may provoke.

01:25:51.051 --> 01:25:53.718
In this way, we can assure...

01:25:54.054 --> 01:25:58.057
Our full strength
and your full safety.

01:26:21.581 --> 01:26:24.183
Excuse me, general.
Who's that?

01:26:24.584 --> 01:26:26.685
<i>not again.</i>

01:26:27.087 --> 01:26:29.555
Abort detonation!

01:26:29.589 --> 01:26:33.092
Get a squad out there
immediately.

01:26:59.985 --> 01:27:02.954
Get off your horse.
You're under arrest.

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:10.662
ma'am!

01:27:33.085 --> 01:27:37.822
Aside from almost
blowing yourself sky high,
what the hell were you doing?

01:27:37.890 --> 01:27:41.826
General, I am simply trying
to get my husband out of
a mental hospital.

01:27:41.894 --> 01:27:44.729
You are well on your way
to going there yourself.

01:27:47.399 --> 01:27:51.302
Did you know that my father
is a very prominent
businessman?

01:27:51.604 --> 01:27:54.338
In fact, he owns...

01:27:54.406 --> 01:27:57.709
Several television stations
back home in virginia.

01:27:58.110 --> 01:28:03.280
He has copies of those reports,
those classified reports,

01:28:03.616 --> 01:28:05.783
And if he doesn't
hear from me by noon today,
he's gonna release them...

01:28:05.851 --> 01:28:09.420
<i>To the, uh,
new york times.
Mrs. Marshall, please.</i>

01:28:09.622 --> 01:28:12.356
Threats and fantasies
don't help.

01:28:12.424 --> 01:28:14.926
The army knows
exactly who you are.

01:28:15.127 --> 01:28:17.629
<i>I know who you are.</i>

01:28:17.696 --> 01:28:20.331
And you know my husband.

01:28:20.633 --> 01:28:25.737
You know that there is not
a crazy bone in his body.

01:28:25.804 --> 01:28:29.641
<i>Not as crazy
as his wife.</i>

01:28:31.376 --> 01:28:34.545
You know, I've been
called that all my life.

01:28:34.613 --> 01:28:39.017
That and a lot worse,
and it doesn't bother me
in the least.

01:28:39.084 --> 01:28:42.353
You can tell people
whatever you want about me.

01:28:42.655 --> 01:28:44.856
Just release my husband.

01:28:44.923 --> 01:28:47.424
Mrs. Marshall,
we're not here
to make deals.

01:28:47.492 --> 01:28:51.829
We can have you arrested
on 20 violations
and throw away the key.

01:28:53.498 --> 01:28:56.000
And what are you gonna
tell those reporters?

01:28:56.168 --> 01:28:59.370
Hmm? What are you
gonna tell those reporters
and their cameras?

01:28:59.672 --> 01:29:01.505
I'm their story.

01:29:01.674 --> 01:29:03.574
Today's newspaper
is tomorrow's trash.

01:29:03.642 --> 01:29:06.844
<i>- And I don't give
a goddamn-
- general. General.</i>

01:29:11.249 --> 01:29:13.250
Mr. Stevens.

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:20.792
My husband said
that you were a fair man.

01:29:21.193 --> 01:29:22.894
Won't you help him?

01:29:29.201 --> 01:29:32.737
Authorities at
a nuclear test site
in mercury, nevada,

01:29:32.805 --> 01:29:35.439
Arrested an unidentified woman
this morning...

01:29:35.507 --> 01:29:39.343
Who was attempting to interfere
with a scheduled weapons test.

01:29:39.411 --> 01:29:41.645
hey, look!

01:29:41.714 --> 01:29:44.015
That's mrs. Marshall!
That's mrs. Marshall!

01:29:44.083 --> 01:29:46.150
Mom, come here!
Mrs. Marshall's on tv! Mom!

01:29:46.218 --> 01:29:48.552
according to the army,

01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:52.223
The woman was carrying
literature linking her
to the communist party.

01:29:52.224 --> 01:29:54.525
The army also claimed...

01:29:54.593 --> 01:29:57.995
The woman is a member
of a fundamentalist
religious sect.

01:29:58.230 --> 01:30:01.232
Officials refuse to disclose
the identity of the woman...

01:30:01.299 --> 01:30:03.434
Goddamn bitch.
Pending further investigation.

01:30:03.501 --> 01:30:07.271
The test has been postponed
due to weather conditions.

01:30:07.339 --> 01:30:09.941
Also in the news,
members of the naacp-

01:30:10.008 --> 01:30:13.577
Ben, this is the game plan.
Prepare discharge papers
for hank marshall right away.

01:30:13.746 --> 01:30:18.249
We could be in deep shit.

01:30:21.253 --> 01:30:23.254
What are you doing, dad?

01:30:25.657 --> 01:30:29.160
I've gotta go to the base.

01:30:29.228 --> 01:30:31.362
<i>You're gonna discharge
major marshall?</i>

01:30:33.265 --> 01:30:35.599
You said he was dangerous.

01:30:35.667 --> 01:30:39.270
You said he was crazy,
he was mentally ill.

01:30:39.337 --> 01:30:44.876
He is, but it's
a little more complicated
than that, glenn.

01:30:45.277 --> 01:30:48.913
- It's a military matter, okay?
- I thought this was
a matter of justice.

01:30:48.981 --> 01:30:51.282
That's what I told alex
when she said
her dad was framed.

01:30:51.283 --> 01:30:53.785
I've got to go.

01:30:55.453 --> 01:30:57.521
This doesn't concern you, son.

01:30:59.858 --> 01:31:03.227
I used to be proud when
you called me your son.

01:31:03.295 --> 01:31:07.098
All my life,
you've lectured me
about honor and justice...

01:31:07.166 --> 01:31:09.667
And the johnson
tradition.

01:31:09.734 --> 01:31:12.303
I believed all that.

01:31:12.370 --> 01:31:18.042
Those words lost their meaning
for your father a while ago.

01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:22.313
This is a personal war
between a man and a woman
that he wanted to screw.

01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:25.582
It's as simple
as that, glenn.

01:31:25.650 --> 01:31:28.820
Just get me
out of here.
Glenn!

01:31:29.721 --> 01:31:31.989
Dr. Vankay's
waiting for you, colonel.

01:31:38.763 --> 01:31:41.765
Vince.
Ben, is everything okay?

01:31:43.035 --> 01:31:45.002
What the hell are you
doing here, george?

01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:48.840
I was ordered here, vince,
by general nieremberg.

01:31:48.907 --> 01:31:51.008
To do what?
I was ordered...

01:31:51.343 --> 01:31:53.945
To provide for the safe
treatment and the discharge
of hank marshall.

01:31:54.296 --> 01:31:57.765
I was also ordered
to relieve you as
commanding officer,

01:31:57.883 --> 01:32:00.985
Pending further orders,
effective immediately.

01:32:19.804 --> 01:32:22.340
Ohh. You just sleep,
babies.

01:32:28.747 --> 01:32:31.415
Ohh.

01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:37.654
Ow.

01:32:37.722 --> 01:32:39.891
what's wrong?

01:32:46.098 --> 01:32:48.732
My leg fell asleep.

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:52.770
We've been driving
for two days.

01:32:56.975 --> 01:33:00.211
I wanted to get here
as fast as I could.

01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:08.419
I didn't know
if you would be waiting.

01:33:11.555 --> 01:33:14.957
Next base,
I'll be different,
I promise.

01:33:19.863 --> 01:33:22.699
There won't be a next base.
I've quit the army.

01:33:31.374 --> 01:33:33.776
Oh, the girls
are gonna be real...

01:33:36.413 --> 01:33:38.715
Happy to hear that.

01:33:40.317 --> 01:33:42.384
What about you,
mrs. Marshall?

01:33:44.354 --> 01:33:46.388
Are you happy?

01:33:52.495 --> 01:33:54.530
Only if you still want me.

01:34:03.690 --> 01:34:05.241
Come here.

01:34:37.074 --> 01:34:39.675
Sir, aren't you
gonna find teaching
to be a little bit tame?

01:34:39.743 --> 01:34:42.444
When I was in nevada, son,
I decided I could no longer
contribute...

01:34:42.512 --> 01:34:44.914
In any manner
to nuclear warfare.

01:34:44.982 --> 01:34:47.416
I think the university is
a perfectly fine place...

01:34:47.484 --> 01:34:50.887
To twist innocent young minds
over to my point of view,
don't you agree?

01:34:50.954 --> 01:34:55.424
<i>- Oh!
- Can you see mom
as a professor's wife?</i>

01:34:55.492 --> 01:34:58.661
It is california.
Maybe things are
a little looser there.

01:34:58.796 --> 01:35:01.463
<i>Daddy, I want a shot
of you and glenn.
What?</i>

01:35:01.531 --> 01:35:03.766
I want a shot
of you and glenn.

01:35:03.801 --> 01:35:06.802
Come on. Get closer.

01:35:06.804 --> 01:35:08.771
Closer.

01:35:10.808 --> 01:35:13.309
wow!

01:35:17.614 --> 01:35:21.117
<i>Great car, mom!
what have you done?</i>

01:35:21.185 --> 01:35:23.119
We're going
to california, daddy.

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:26.956
We can't drive up in front
of the brown derby
in that old jalopy.

01:35:27.024 --> 01:35:30.159
<i>I liked
that old jalopy.</i>

01:35:30.227 --> 01:35:33.162
Now, nobody has said
anything about my hair.

01:35:33.330 --> 01:35:36.664
- You look like
elizabeth taylor.
- There.

01:35:36.732 --> 01:35:39.500
You have said
the secret word,

01:35:39.568 --> 01:35:42.170
And you qualify for a ride
in my new convertible.

01:35:42.238 --> 01:35:45.706
Come on, sweet boy.

01:35:45.775 --> 01:35:49.677
Well, let's go.
Come on, daddy.
You drive.

01:35:53.082 --> 01:35:59.954
<i>¶</i>

01:36:00.022 --> 01:36:04.859
<i>well, now, it takes
more than a robin</i>

01:36:04.927 --> 01:36:07.695
<i>to make the winter go</i>

01:36:07.763 --> 01:36:12.100
<i>and it takes
two lips of fire</i>

01:36:12.167 --> 01:36:15.103
<i>to melt away the snow</i>

01:36:15.171 --> 01:36:19.174
well, it takes
two hearts a-cookin'

01:36:19.241 --> 01:36:22.310
to make a fire grow

01:36:22.377 --> 01:36:24.745
and, baby

01:36:24.814 --> 01:36:26.781
you've got what it takes

01:36:26.849 --> 01:36:29.117
<i>oh, yeah</i>

01:36:29.185 --> 01:36:32.720
you know it takes
a lot of kissin'

01:36:32.788 --> 01:36:35.957
<i>Tell me about it.
to make a romance sweet</i>

01:36:36.025 --> 01:36:40.929
<i>Aha.
ooh, it takes
a lot of lovin'</i>

01:36:40.996 --> 01:36:43.464
to make my life complete

01:36:43.532 --> 01:36:48.402
<i>mmm, and it takes
a lot of woman</i>

01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:51.405
<i>to knock me
off my feet</i>

01:36:51.473 --> 01:36:53.741
<i>and, baby</i>

01:36:53.809 --> 01:36:56.544
<i>you've got
what it takes</i>

01:36:58.247 --> 01:37:03.985
I said
mmm hmm hmm mmm

01:37:05.587 --> 01:37:09.824
uh-huh, mmm

01:37:09.892 --> 01:37:13.127
<i>you know you've got
just what it takes</i>

01:37:13.195 --> 01:37:17.732
<i>because it takes
more than an effort</i>

01:37:17.799 --> 01:37:21.135
<i>to stay away from you</i>

01:37:21.203 --> 01:37:24.538
<i>it'd take more
than a lifetime</i>

01:37:24.606 --> 01:37:27.441
<i>to prove
that I'll be true</i>

01:37:27.509 --> 01:37:31.612
but it takes
somebody special

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.815
<i>to make me say, "I do"
oh, yeah?</i>

01:37:34.884 --> 01:37:37.151
and, baby

01:37:37.219 --> 01:37:39.820
you've got what it takes

01:37:41.690 --> 01:37:46.995
uh-huh
mmm hmm hmm mmm

01:37:49.731 --> 01:37:53.268
mmm

01:37:53.335 --> 01:37:56.570
<i>you know you've got
just what it takes</i>

01:37:56.638 --> 01:38:00.574
<i>Because- you're back
in my spot again, honey.
I like your spot.</i>

01:38:00.642 --> 01:38:03.878
<i>to stay away from you
I can't stay away.
Let's do it again.</i>

01:38:03.946 --> 01:38:07.648
<i>it takes more than
a lifetime, daddy
oh, yeah.</i>

01:38:07.716 --> 01:38:10.818
to prove that I'll be true
now it's you.

01:38:10.886 --> 01:38:15.456
<i>but it takes
somebody special
like me, baby.</i>

01:38:15.524 --> 01:38:18.126
<i>to make me say I do</i>

01:38:18.193 --> 01:38:20.494
and, baby

01:38:20.562 --> 01:38:22.563

01:38:22.631 --> 01:38:25.333
<i>Say it again.
Come on. Let's do it
one more time, all right?</i>

01:38:25.401 --> 01:38:27.535

01:38:29.805 --> 01:38:33.141
<i>One more time, brook.
All right, okay.</i>
