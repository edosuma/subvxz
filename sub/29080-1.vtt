[announcer] <i> We talk</i>
  <i> about David Beckham, Claudio</i>
        <i> Caniggia, Pele,</i>

02:17.538 --> 02:20.539
<i> world class players</i>
   <i> in the MLS at their peak.</i>

02:20.541 --> 02:22.441
<i> Well, it's time to add another</i>
  <i> player to that list because</i>

02:22.443 --> 02:26.178
nobody's done more for the
      profile of US Soccer
       than Ryan Hawkes.

02:26.180 --> 02:31.250
[crowd chanting]
    HAWKES! HAWKES! HAWKES!

02:32.319 --> 02:34.253
[announcer]
 And now, what we are seeing is

02:34.255 --> 02:37.289
just dominating the possession
 for most of this half, and...

02:37.291 --> 02:39.391
We all know if you...

02:49.336 --> 02:50.502
[Danny]
        Go, go, go! Go!

03:01.615 --> 03:03.382
[announcer]
 But he's got to be able to get

03:03.384 --> 03:05.684
rid of the ball as well as
   finish, and you know what

03:05.686 --> 03:07.452
his choice is always gonna be.

03:07.454 --> 03:12.558
[announcer 2 indiscernible]

03:23.370 --> 03:27.306
[Lana] Danny,
     we have to get going.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.908
[Lana] Come on.
   Put your arm through here.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.310
Good boy.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.212
[Danny in Russian]

03:33.214 --> 03:35.047
Practice your English.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.881
Watch!
    Hawkes has got the ball.

03:40.521 --> 03:43.222
You want to watch the game or
       play in one? Huh?

03:43.224 --> 03:47.326
[Ruslan in Russian]

03:53.634 --> 03:56.802
[Lana in Russian]

03:56.804 --> 03:59.738
[Ruslan in Russian]

04:29.603 --> 04:32.571
[Hawkes] What are you watching,
man? Give a card! Come on! Jeez.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.589
[Giorgio] Pass the ball
             Ryan.

04:33.590 --> 04:34.606
I was going for the tap in.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.342
[Hawkes] I'll tap in right now.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.728
[Danny] Yeah!

04:56.730 --> 04:58.897
[Lana] Score!

04:59.633 --> 05:01.667
Did you see that?

05:01.669 --> 05:04.370
[Lana]
      He got another goal.

05:04.371 --> 05:07.072
Good for him, and now we
  have to go get you one, hm?

05:15.582 --> 05:17.516
Record man yes!

05:17.518 --> 05:19.918
[announcer] He's now only three
    goals away from beating
           Wodolowsk

05:19.920 --> 05:23.388
and Wright-Phillips' shared
record of 27 goals in a season.

05:23.390 --> 05:26.358
With the playoffs coming up,
he's got to fancy his chances.

05:26.360 --> 05:26.925
[camera shutter snaps]

05:37.004 --> 05:39.471
[cellphone chimes]

05:53.420 --> 05:55.554
Danny...

05:55.556 --> 05:58.457
Why the sad face? Hm?

05:58.459 --> 06:00.625
You can't score in every game.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.961
[Lana] Not even your hero
      Hawkes can do that.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.463
Where's Papa?

06:04.465 --> 06:05.831
He had to work.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.499
He always has to work.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.768
But hey, I took so
      many photos of you!

06:09.770 --> 06:12.838
So he's gonna see what a
  little soccer star you are.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.609
[Lana] Come on, let's go.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.945
[Billy] This is gonna send
you back to the laundry.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.580
[laughing] Yeah!

06:21.582 --> 06:24.649
Billy? Billy, my man!

06:24.651 --> 06:26.585
[Billy]
          Veinticinco!

06:26.587 --> 06:28.653
[both] Club record!

06:29.623 --> 06:31.456
I just got off the
        phone with Lang.

06:31.458 --> 06:34.059
Reminded him,  this triggers
     another bonus clause.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.894
Ah, that's why
       I love you, baby.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.162
That's not the only good news.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.430
Really?

06:43.470 --> 06:45.170
[Hawkes] See you in the
         playoffs man!

06:45.172 --> 06:48.740
Hey Chuck, what's going on?
        Good game, man.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.909
[Giorgio] Hey Billy,
    we should chat sometime.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.077
[soccer player]  Hey, what's
going on? Good game, man.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.613
Arsenal called again.

06:54.615 --> 06:55.947
Yeah and?

06:55.949 --> 06:58.083
You like English food,
           don't you?

06:58.085 --> 07:00.852
I like wine country
      and the beach Billy.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.054
It's a good job I didn't
        tell them that.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.189
They want you big time.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.191
Yeah? Well, what's the offer?

07:06.193 --> 07:07.993
Well, it doesn't
        include a beach.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.595
They're talking about
  doubling what you make now,

07:10.597 --> 07:12.597
and that's without all the
      extra endorsements.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.733
[Hawkes] Come on Bangers and
        Mash it may be.

07:14.735 --> 07:19.738
Who loves you, baby?
Hey! Oh, come on.
     I got you, I got you.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.806
Hey, come on here.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.642
Nice to see you, man.
     Thanks for coming out.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.977
Oh, I'll come back,
      I'll come back. Hey!

07:26.847 --> 07:33.585
Hello! This is he.
Wait, what's that charity again?

07:33.587 --> 07:37.689
Yeah, yes I got your invitation.
       One second. Ryan?

07:37.691 --> 07:39.141
Yeah, what's up?

07:39.142 --> 07:40.592
[Billy]
It's the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.694
They want to confirm
  your attendance for Sunday.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.464
This Sunday? No, tell them I'll
 see them in the summer, okay?

07:45.466 --> 07:48.133
[Billy] Whoa, man,
this is cold!

07:48.135 --> 07:49.935
I got to focus
     on the playoffs, man.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.170
I want that record, Billy.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.239
Tell them but um,
       I can't make it...

07:54.241 --> 07:55.858
I don't know,
       throw some money.

07:55.859 --> 07:57.476
Give them like a hundred grand.
       It's kids, right?

07:57.478 --> 07:58.944
Throw them two
      hundred grand, okay?

07:58.946 --> 08:00.946
[Billy] Ryan,
     one hundred's plenty.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.648
Two hundred Billy and It's
   gonna help with that whole

08:03.650 --> 08:05.183
Sportsman of the Year
          thing right?

08:05.184 --> 08:06.717
You know what I mean.
    You see it, you see it.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.720
You know what I'm saying.
     Hey, sorry about that.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.656
[Elise] Ryan!

08:10.657 --> 08:12.591
[Hawkes] Oh! Wait, wait, she's
with me. She's with me. Come on.

08:12.593 --> 08:15.794
Hey baby, you made it!

08:15.796 --> 08:17.262
[Elise]
  You broke the world record?

08:17.264 --> 08:21.633
Oh, club record, baby.
   But, um, we'll get there.

08:21.635 --> 08:24.303
We're gonna get it,
          don't worry.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.972
[Elise] You better. Just don't
    forget your inspiration.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.907
[Hawkes] How could I?

08:28.909 --> 08:31.743
Oh that reminds me.

08:31.744 --> 08:34.578
Here, come on.
     All right. Listen up!

08:34.581 --> 08:35.679
It's been a good night, right?

08:35.682 --> 08:36.548
[crowd cheering]

08:36.549 --> 08:39.568
Been a good night, yeah!

08:39.568 --> 08:42.587
But it's gonna get a
     lot better right now.

08:42.589 --> 08:47.526
Elise Martin, will you marry me?

08:47.528 --> 08:51.596
Yes!

08:51.598 --> 08:53.331
There you go!

08:53.332 --> 08:55.065
Let me get that on.
   Let me get that on there.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.669
Oh, too heavy for you?
        I'm sorry, baby.

09:00.274 --> 09:03.975
Billy's getting jealous.
I'll get back to you, all right?

09:03.977 --> 09:07.612
Stay pretty.
          Hey not bad!

09:07.614 --> 09:09.314
I hope you know
       what you're doing.

09:09.316 --> 09:15.754
Really? I'll tell Elise you said
            hi, huh?

09:15.756 --> 09:21.226
There goes [indiscernible]
moron... moron!

09:24.064 --> 09:26.831
[rain pattering]

09:40.814 --> 09:42.681
Mom, let's go!

09:51.325 --> 09:56.595
[electronic dance music blaring]

09:57.831 --> 09:59.197
So this is the ring.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.899
[Man] Oh my god!

10:00.900 --> 10:02.600
-[woman] It's so beautiful!
   -[Elise] Isn't it amazing?

10:02.603 --> 10:04.119
[woman] So beautiful.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.636
[Elise] Yeah so he proposed
  just outside the stadium...

10:05.639 --> 10:08.139
so he went down on one knee...

10:08.141 --> 10:10.008
[Lana] You see?

10:10.010 --> 10:13.378
This one's almost done,
and that one's still developing.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.014
-[Lana] It probably needs
        another minute.
         -[Danny] Yeah.

10:16.016 --> 10:20.318
[Lana] Just grab it right here
and pick it up. Careful.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.087
Yep.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.855
[Lana] Look! You see?
          That's you!

10:58.892 --> 11:00.859
I don't have any homework.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.670

[motor revving]

12:34.321 --> 12:37.489
[Elise] Oh my god, baby,
we have totally gone Kardashian.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.858
[Hawkes] Hmm?

12:39.859 --> 12:42.226
[Elise] Look, we are all over
   ESPN, TMZ, Twitter, look!

12:42.229 --> 12:44.312
No, baby, you're not
       looking properly!

12:44.313 --> 12:46.396
-[Elise] Come on. Pay Attention!
-[Hawkes] I am looking.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.267
[Hawkes]
       Hang on, hang on.

12:49.269 --> 12:53.538
[Hawkes]
All right. Wow, that's not bad!

12:53.540 --> 12:55.273

14:22.429 --> 14:26.631
Elise!
 What's happened to my fiancÃ©?

14:26.633 --> 14:30.635
[doctor] She is fine Mr. Hawkes.
    She is at home, resting.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.637
[Billy]
         Welcome back!

14:32.639 --> 14:36.107
Hey Billy. You know something?

14:36.109 --> 14:38.009
Something's happening to my leg.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.161
What's this?

14:40.162 --> 14:42.312
Banged it up a little bit.
   Doctor here took good care
            of you.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.251
[Billy] Don't pull that.
   Little snafu with the law.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.187
[Billy] Me and the lawyers are
    gonna--stop pulling it!

14:49.189 --> 14:50.488
[Billy]
  A little community service,

14:50.490 --> 14:56.261
some don't drink and drive
    PSAs, a few bucks to AA.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.029
Everything's gonna be fine.
     Don't worry about it.

14:58.031 --> 15:01.432
[Hawkes] Playoffs? The World
  Cup, I'm not gonna make it.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.334
[Billy]
      Nonsense, Nonsense.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.904
You'll be back again
playing before you know it.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.206
I gotta get that record Billy.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.175
[Billy] You're gonna get it.
    You're gonna get lots of
            records.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.177
You're also gonna
       get a DUI record.

15:13.179 --> 15:16.180
What'd you try to do, redesign
   the Pacific Coast Highway?

15:16.182 --> 15:18.416
[Billy] Who do you think xou
    are, Frank Lloyd Wright?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.385
What's the matter with you?

15:20.387 --> 15:22.186
Billy, I'm scared.

15:22.188 --> 15:24.222
[Billy]
         You're scared?

15:24.223 --> 15:26.257
You don't have to be scared.
          You're you.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.170
[Billy]
             Okay?

15:28.171 --> 15:30.082
-[Billy] I'll see you later.
    -[Hawkes] Thanks, Billy.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.994
I'm outside. You interrupted
     my pedicure, you know.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.498
[Hawkes laughs]

15:33.500 --> 15:35.600

17:39.659 --> 17:41.492
-[Nurse] That's it!
        -[Hawkes] Okay.

17:41.494 --> 17:46.064
That's good.
You're doing great, Mr. Hawkes.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.465
Look at you!

17:49.636 --> 17:52.237
Really?

17:52.238 --> 17:54.839
-[cameras shuttering]
      -[Hawkes] I want to
apologize to my fans. I...

17:54.841 --> 18:00.344
What I did, driving under the
influence was both reckless and
         irresponsible.

18:00.346 --> 18:03.247
I would especially like to
   apologize to my teammates,

18:03.249 --> 18:09.520
as it appears that this injury
  means, I will not be able to
     play in the playoffs,

18:09.522 --> 18:12.356
or the Summer World Cup
           next year.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.644
<i> But we'll get it all back.</i>

20:46.645 --> 20:47.911
You just lay low.

[Billy] <i> Go to rehab.</i>
       <i> Once this is over,</i>

20:51.251 --> 20:53.251
<i> they'll be right back to</i>
       <i> kissing your ass.</i>

20:53.253 --> 20:55.519
European style. Two cheeks.

20:55.521 --> 20:56.787
[Billy makes kissing noises]

20:57.590 --> 20:59.724
[dialtone buzzing]

20:59.725 --> 21:01.859
[sports anchor] <i> There's a lot of</i>
   <i> teams that have friction.</i>

21:01.860 --> 21:03.994
<i> You know your star players</i>
     <i> have personalities and</i>
<i> people are gonna bump heads.</i>

21:03.997 --> 21:05.763
<i> What we're worried about</i>
    <i> right now is his health,</i>

21:05.765 --> 21:07.798
<i> and maybe he could learn</i>
    <i> a lesson from all this.</i>

21:07.800 --> 21:09.867
<i> Guys look, Ryan Hawkes,</i>

21:09.869 --> 21:14.639
<i> one of the great players ever</i>
<i>to play in Major League Soccer.</i>

21:14.641 --> 21:17.842

   <i> who's behaving like a boy.</i>

21:17.844 --> 21:20.311
<i> Drunk driving?</i>
       <i> It's unacceptable.</i>

21:20.313 --> 21:24.448
<i> So as far as I'm concerned,</i>
<i> Ryan Hawkes as a professional</i>
   <i> soccer player, he's done!</i>

21:24.450 --> 21:25.549
Aargh!

21:27.520 --> 21:29.420
[woman in Russian]

22:08.328 --> 22:11.028
[Danny]
    How far away is Greece?

22:11.030 --> 22:13.464
It's actually not that far.

22:13.466 --> 22:17.435
Short flight south,
    near Mediterranean Sea.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.704
Are there pirates?

22:19.706 --> 22:23.441
[laughing]
        No, no pirates.

22:23.976 --> 22:26.777
You'll make good money?

22:26.779 --> 22:29.714
Mm-hmm...

22:29.716 --> 22:32.383
and I'll only be gone for
           six weeks.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.784
Six weeks?!

[Lana in Russian]

[Marina in Russian]

23:35.181 --> 23:40.618
[Zimmer] Excellence is a must,
   and our guests expect it.

23:40.620 --> 23:46.190
I demand it, and it is
    your job to deliver it.

23:46.192 --> 23:50.628
I assume most of you have never
been on a ship like this before,
             so....

23:50.630 --> 23:52.763
Pay very close attention.

23:52.765 --> 23:56.834
We have five sails, four diesel
     engines, three decks,

23:56.836 --> 24:02.006
two five-stars restaurants,
       one casino, and...

24:02.008 --> 24:05.876
absolutely zero
     exception in quality.

24:09.215 --> 24:10.681
Time to see the rooms.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.984
These are the ocean view suites,

24:15.788 --> 24:18.122
and this is your room.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.859
You have an hour to unpack,

24:21.861 --> 24:25.963
and after that, meet in the
ballroom for further briefing.

24:27.633 --> 24:31.168
Hi I'm Sabine. I'm from Poland.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.120
Hi.

24:33.121 --> 24:35.071
Angela, Haiti.
     Do not touch my stuff.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.808
I'm Lana,
    I'm from St. Petersburg.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.776
[Amanda] Ooh!

24:39.979 --> 24:42.246
They gave you the
     job in the piano bar?

24:42.248 --> 24:44.248
Did you blow Zimmer
         or something?

24:44.250 --> 24:45.950
And this is Amanda.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.819
She's from New Jersey,
   in case you couldn't tell.

24:51.557 --> 24:53.657
Oh, this one is free.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.259
[Lana] Thank you.

[upbeat music]

25:16.015 --> 25:18.215
There it is.
 There it is, that's my dress.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.683
[Friend] Oh my god,
         it's amazing!

25:19.685 --> 25:21.786
It's beautiful, huh?

25:21.787 --> 25:23.888
So we're thinking either Jay-Z
 or Kanye West for the wedding.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.623
We just can't decide which.

25:28.027 --> 25:31.095
[couple murmuring]

25:31.097 --> 25:33.898
[faint police siren]

25:47.013 --> 25:49.113
Are you drinking without me?

25:53.686 --> 25:57.087
[gags] Gross!
           All yours.

25:58.157 --> 26:01.258
So are you coming back
    inside or are you having
     too much fun sulking?

26:01.260 --> 26:03.594
I'm...

26:03.596 --> 26:07.064
I don't know if I could
 do this whole thing right now.

26:08.668 --> 26:12.169
What do you mean,
       this whole thing?

26:12.171 --> 26:13.971
I, I need some time.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.893
I've been gone a whole month.

26:18.894 --> 26:21.879
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you have.
  You have been gone a month.

26:21.881 --> 26:24.949
I need time for me,
  and not just, not with you,

26:24.951 --> 26:26.901
but none of this paparazzi...

26:26.902 --> 26:28.852
And you're telling me this
   tonight? At our engagement
             party?

26:28.854 --> 26:30.988
I'm sorry, but it's,
       driving me crazy!

26:30.990 --> 26:33.924
No-no-no,
  you do not get to be sorry!

26:33.926 --> 26:35.876
I did not tell the world we're
        getting married

26:35.877 --> 26:37.827
so you can go and have some
  pill-popping meltdown okay.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.197
Because you could've killed
     me in that car wreck,

26:40.199 --> 26:42.633
and I could've sued
      you for everything.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.135
But I didn't.
        I stuck by you,

26:45.137 --> 26:47.738
and now it's your turn.
           So man up!

26:48.140 --> 26:51.742
Because we are getting
      married this summer!

26:53.346 --> 26:54.745
Wow.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.751
You must really love me.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.756
Hey!

27:08.361 --> 27:10.394
Stop! Stop the car! Stop it!

27:10.396 --> 27:11.829
Where are you going?

27:11.831 --> 27:13.897
[Hawkes]
    You said summer, right?

27:13.899 --> 27:15.666
[Hawkes]
      Get me out of here!

27:15.668 --> 27:17.301
[Elise] No!

27:17.303 --> 27:19.069
[Elise screams]

27:19.071 --> 27:22.740
[camera shuttering]

27:22.742 --> 27:24.775
Give me that!

27:24.777 --> 27:25.909
[Paparazzi]
     Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.011
[Elise upset] Argh!

27:31.917 --> 27:34.785
[taxi driver] All right buddy.
 So what's up? Where we going?

28:09.121 --> 28:12.456
Hey look, this is the last time
   I'm gonna answer my phone
Billy, so you know make it good.

28:12.792 --> 28:13.857
Ryan, where are you?

28:15.327 --> 28:17.294
Oh, you know Billy,
        someplace warm.

28:17.296 --> 28:20.964
So am I.
       It's called Hell!

28:20.966 --> 28:22.866
What are you thinking?
     You can't just leave.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.869
Ryan,
  we have major problems here.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.206
That DUI put you in breach of
 contract, you understand that?

28:29.341 --> 28:32.209
That means Lang's not obligated
       to pay you a dime

28:32.211 --> 28:34.244
while you're injured, and now
    he's even talking about

28:34.246 --> 28:38.415
canceling your contract
   altogether, and suing you!

28:38.784 --> 28:42.286
This is most definitely not the
 time to be taking a vacation!

28:45.124 --> 28:48.358
[Billy on phone]
         Hello? Hello?

28:51.363 --> 28:53.731
He hung up.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.200
[sighs]

28:56.202 --> 28:57.801
Don't stop.

29:00.406 --> 29:05.109
Oh my god, Lana.
      I snuck a picture of
    him going into his room.

29:05.111 --> 29:08.212
He is perfection!

29:09.482 --> 29:14.017
I would do things to him that
 are illegal in most countries.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.386
Girls, he's engaged!

29:16.388 --> 29:20.324
[Amanda clears throat]
    TMZ said they broke up,

29:20.326 --> 29:23.026
and she isn't here, but I am.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.496
If Zimmer even catches
you flirting, you'll get fired.

29:25.498 --> 29:28.766
Zimmer's got to catch me first.

29:28.768 --> 29:31.235
I'm gonna harpoon that whale.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.078
Good evening.

29:41.080 --> 29:44.982
Uh... Lana?

29:44.984 --> 29:46.950
I'm Ryan.
       Nice to meet you.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.352
Ryan Hawkes?

29:48.854 --> 29:52.289
Oh, goddamnit. Was there
   like a memo or something?

29:52.291 --> 29:54.858
Actually, there was.

29:55.528 --> 29:56.794
Right.

29:57.096 --> 29:59.963
Um, What can I get you, sir?

29:59.965 --> 30:03.200
Umm, okay.
      First two things...

30:03.202 --> 30:08.505
don't call me sir,
    and uh second, um, dirty
     martini. Upside down.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.307
Coming right up.

30:22.888 --> 30:25.022
Very good.
It's good. Very good.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.857
[piano player]
    Thanks. Goodnight Lana.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.992
-[Hawkes] Goodnight!
       -[Lana] Bye, Sam.

30:32.097 --> 30:34.965
Oh, we closed this place down.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.335
So, Lana, Lana. Talk to me.

30:38.337 --> 30:41.605
Um, I wanna know things.
        Where you from?

30:41.607 --> 30:43.941
You from Russia?

30:43.943 --> 30:46.260
St. Petersburg.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.578
St. Petersburg?
   Like Zenit St. Petersburg?
          That's cool.

30:48.581 --> 30:49.913
Pretty cool.

30:49.915 --> 30:51.415
Is that all you know
         about Russia?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.951
[Hawkes scoffs]
             No...

30:53.953 --> 30:57.955
There's Sputnik,
   and it snows all the time.

30:57.957 --> 31:03.327
There's giant um,
       bears everywhere.

31:03.329 --> 31:06.430
Yeah. I keep one as a pet.

31:08.234 --> 31:11.102
You know you don't.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.971
Um, I'm, I'm getting
   the feeling that you don't
    really wanna talk to me.

31:13.973 --> 31:19.910
Okay, Mr. Talker.
      So, what brings you
        to this cruise?

31:19.912 --> 31:24.448
Maybe I just uh, just
      came here to drown.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.650
Just know in case there
        is an accident,

31:26.652 --> 31:31.388
and the ship starts sinking,
   we are the ones who'll be
     manning the lifeboats.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.324
You will manage a lifeboat?
         The whole one?

31:34.326 --> 31:38.428
Mm-hmm. It's my job,
 to save people from drowning.

31:40.566 --> 31:43.567
Of course, except...
           I'm sorry.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.636
Is it me or is this
         ship spinning?

31:45.638 --> 31:49.406
I'm pretty sure it's you.
  And you should go to sleep.

31:49.408 --> 31:55.112
All right, fine.
 Because I like you, I'm gonna
      go, but I'm gonna...

31:55.114 --> 31:57.214
I'm, excuse me,
       I'm gonna see you.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.182
I'm gonna see you...

31:59.184 --> 31:59.917
Soon.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.018
Hm?

32:02.288 --> 32:05.489
It's a small ship,
   and this is the only bar.

32:07.059 --> 32:10.661
That's a good point.
    Yes. I will, um, I will
         see you soon.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.263
I'm just gonna...

32:17.236 --> 32:19.336
All right, I'll think about you.

32:19.471 --> 32:22.439
Oh, I'm sorry.
  We're closed. We're closed.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.510
[Hawkes] Bye Lana!

32:30.649 --> 32:34.384
So, what does a man worth
 50 million dollars feel like?

32:34.386 --> 32:35.986
[Angela]
        Amazing, right?

32:35.988 --> 32:37.587
I bet he's hard as a rock.

32:37.589 --> 32:38.488
Hey!

32:38.490 --> 32:40.724
What? I meant his muscles.

32:40.726 --> 32:42.326
Anyway...

32:42.328 --> 32:43.660
Try no million.

32:43.662 --> 32:46.129
I read he lost all of his
          endorsements

32:46.131 --> 32:48.332
and his team is about
          to sue him.

32:48.334 --> 32:53.503
Girls, I made him drinks and I
talked to him because I had to,
         but that's it.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.138
'Cause that's you, Lana.

32:55.140 --> 33:00.410
Sensible, like a pair
      of nurse's sneakers.

33:01.413 --> 33:05.015
What am I even worried about?

33:05.017 --> 33:09.686
We all know that men like Ryan
  don't go for women like you.

33:12.257 --> 33:14.191
Don't listen to her.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.993
No, she's right.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.728
Girl...

33:17.729 --> 33:19.462
You are either blind or you
    seriously underestimate
           yourself.

33:19.465 --> 33:20.497
You're gorgeous.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.332
Thank you.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.600
Hey, it's my, um,

34:30.601 --> 34:34.304
it's my lifeguard!
   Come to save me. Too late.

34:35.407 --> 34:38.375
I really think you shouldn't
   drink anymore, Mr. Hawkes.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.683
Fine. Screw it.

35:32.264 --> 35:33.697
Thank you.

35:49.181 --> 35:51.715
Grandma said you were
          out earlier.

35:51.717 --> 35:52.749
Were you playing soccer?

35:52.751 --> 35:55.852
No. I play with Alina.

35:56.722 --> 35:57.787
Alina?

35:57.789 --> 35:59.489
[Lana]
          <i> Who's Alina?</i>

35:59.491 --> 36:00.590
Just a girl.

36:01.693 --> 36:04.261
You never used to like
         girls before.

36:04.563 --> 36:05.896
<i> That was before.</i>

36:07.199 --> 36:08.798
Before you grow up?

36:09.635 --> 36:11.168
Goodnight, mama.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.944
Sorry about before. Uh,

36:20.946 --> 36:23.313
painkillers and daiquiris
     are a terrible combo.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.548
That's all right.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.449
That and most women,
       when they meet me,

36:26.451 --> 36:31.755
are just a lot flirtier
   than that, no, like nicer.
No, um, different...

36:31.757 --> 36:33.690
[Hawkes]
         To... to you.

36:33.692 --> 36:38.395
Oh, I'm not most women.
  And I'm definitely not your
         kind of woman.

36:38.397 --> 36:41.231
Well, I don't know if
         I'd say that.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.402
Yeah. All right.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.470
Good save, Ryan.
            Smooth.

36:51.476 --> 36:52.642
Oh, hey!

36:52.644 --> 36:54.461
Wanna take a break with me?

36:54.462 --> 36:56.279
You need to stop following me.
      I'll get in trouble.

36:56.281 --> 36:58.848
I am not following you.
           [chuckles]

37:00.786 --> 37:03.787
Oh my  ,
      I am following you.

37:03.789 --> 37:06.423
[Hawkes] All right, come on.
  I don't want you to get the
wrong idea here.

37:07.759 --> 37:09.593
Mr. Zimmer

37:09.595 --> 37:12.229
Good evening, Mr. Hawkes.

37:12.598 --> 37:15.398
Ms. Kalinina, a word, please.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.977
This is unacceptable.

37:26.979 --> 37:29.213
Uh, excuse me. Um,

37:29.214 --> 37:31.448
she was actually helping me
 decide which drink I ordered.

37:31.450 --> 37:32.782
What was the one you
        suggested again?

37:32.784 --> 37:35.318
A dirty martini,
          upside down.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.087
That's the thing.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.855
See, I forgot the upside down
 part. Can I get one of those?

37:38.857 --> 37:39.789
Certainly, sir.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.626
You have to take Friday off.

37:42.628 --> 37:45.229
Did I do anything wrong?

37:45.230 --> 37:47.831
You cannot work four weeks
without a day off.

37:48.567 --> 37:50.300
And goodnight to you, sir.

37:51.637 --> 37:52.736
Goodnight

37:53.805 --> 37:54.904
Thanks.

37:56.475 --> 37:59.409
Now, where is my martini?

38:02.481 --> 38:04.598
[Hawkes] Okay, new idea.
      Hear me out on this.

38:04.599 --> 38:06.716
What if we meet up off
   the boat? You're free now,

38:06.718 --> 38:09.352
so are there rules against
   meeting up on the island?

38:09.354 --> 38:11.488
[Lana] No, but that's not
        going to happen.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.823
Why not? Look, I mean,
     I'm telling you, Lana,

38:13.825 --> 38:17.060
I am a great tour guide.
    I can Google pretty much
   anything you need to know.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.863
And you? You, you can
teach me Russian.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.998
You want to learn Russian?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.901
Yeah. I hear they have a very
    cheery outlook on life.

38:24.903 --> 38:25.869
[Lana laughs]

38:26.571 --> 38:27.971
Good night, Ryan.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.372
Wait, was that a yes?

38:29.374 --> 38:31.841
Okay, yes, but now be quiet,
            please!

38:31.843 --> 38:33.810
Whoa! Did you hear that?
         She said yes!

38:33.812 --> 38:35.612
She said yes, everybody!

38:38.850 --> 38:41.735
Hey, Ms. Kalinina,

38:41.736 --> 38:44.621
the ship leaves tomorrow at 10
  o'clock so be on the boat no
      later then midnight.

38:44.623 --> 38:45.922
Thank you.

39:06.878 --> 39:07.711
[Lana] Hello

39:07.713 --> 39:08.678
[shopkeeper] Hello.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.747
[Lana]
     What do you have here?

39:10.749 --> 39:11.848
[shopkeeper]
        Oh, everything.

39:13.719 --> 39:17.787
I like this one.
        It's beautiful.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.959
[Lana] No, this would be
       perfect actually.

39:22.961 --> 39:25.895
[shopkeeper] Please go ahead.
           Thank you.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.314
Thanks a lot.

39:27.315 --> 39:28.732
Good morning there,
      my sweet surrender.

39:28.734 --> 39:29.766
Hi...

39:29.768 --> 39:32.769
Oh, relax. It'll be our
         little secret.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.671
You're gonna follow me all day,
          aren't you?

39:34.673 --> 39:36.873
Well, now that you mention it...

39:38.410 --> 39:41.745
[Lana] So, I was thinking about
   all those sorrows you say

39:41.747 --> 39:43.146
you like to drown yourself from.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.748
[Hawkes] We're not gonna talk
    about that now, are we?

39:44.750 --> 39:47.817
Well, I'm Russian.
    We don't do small talk.

39:47.819 --> 39:51.521
All right. You like the
    heavy stuff. Fine, okay.

39:51.523 --> 39:54.891
Well, after not making peace
 with the fact that my knee is

39:54.893 --> 40:00.630
shot and my endorsements have
 de-endorsed me and if I do get
         to play again,

40:00.632 --> 40:02.932
I won't be the player
          I once was.

40:02.934 --> 40:06.035
I guess what's there to
    worry about? My life is
        basically over.

40:08.607 --> 40:13.143
Ryan, but I believe when
 one door closes, others open.

40:13.145 --> 40:16.613
Just don't stare at the
    closed one for too long.

40:21.686 --> 40:23.453
You sure you're not some kind
   of undercover journalist?

40:23.455 --> 40:25.422
You're way too wise to be
       working on a boat.

40:29.461 --> 40:33.062
Anyway, it's uh, it's not
   really about seeing doors,

40:33.064 --> 40:36.032
it's honestly, it's about
       how people see me.

40:37.536 --> 40:41.171
Are you afraid that people
   are not gonna like you for
          who you are?

40:41.173 --> 40:44.541
Hell no. I know they won't.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.477
When you're in the spotlight,
   everybody wants to be your
            friend.

40:47.479 --> 40:49.646
But as I'm finding out,

40:49.648 --> 40:52.782
when that goes away,
[whistles] goes everybody else.

40:54.719 --> 40:57.620
But now that you have time
     to do something else,

40:57.622 --> 40:59.722
you might make some
         real friends.

41:01.460 --> 41:04.594
If I'm, uh, perfectly honest,

41:04.596 --> 41:08.164
it's the something else that
    I'm most worried about.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.102
I don't know anything else.

41:16.508 --> 41:20.109
Lana, I wasn't always such
     an asshole, you know.

41:21.012 --> 41:25.582
I trained my whole life
    to be the best I can be,
         at one thing.

41:25.584 --> 41:28.685
All this other stuff kind of
 just came with the territory,
I guess.

41:31.857 --> 41:34.123
It was a way...

41:34.960 --> 41:37.594
Lana, without soccer...

41:39.664 --> 41:40.730
I'm not really anything.

41:40.732 --> 41:44.534
I'm sure you have many
         more talents.

41:44.536 --> 41:47.637
There's a whole world out there
   waiting to be discovered.

41:48.640 --> 41:53.743
But to [indiscernible]
  you discover nothing without
     taking the first step.

41:59.851 --> 42:02.952
Hey! Hey! Oh, that's it.
    Now you're gonna get it!

42:03.722 --> 42:05.822
[Lana laughs]

42:09.060 --> 42:12.161
[yelling and laughing]

42:34.886 --> 42:36.319
[Lana] Let's check it out.

42:37.722 --> 42:38.922
[Hawkes] Hello, sir.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.023
[Lana] Hi.

42:40.025 --> 42:42.559
Who are you, like the
        local locksmith?

42:44.796 --> 42:47.597
Uh-huh...
           I'm not...

42:47.599 --> 42:49.699
[Hawkes] Oh, I... okay.

42:50.335 --> 42:54.337
Ah, I get it.
     The lock is the heart.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.839
You give it to someone, then...

42:56.841 --> 42:59.642
Throw away the key,
   making the lock permanent?

43:00.111 --> 43:02.111
That's beautiful.

43:02.113 --> 43:04.581
[Lana] It's very nice.

43:04.583 --> 43:07.951
-Oh, no, no. No, no thank you.
          -Oh. No, no.

43:07.953 --> 43:10.053
-[Lana] Thank you, sir.
  -[Hawkes] I think you might
      have the wrong idea.

43:11.756 --> 43:13.356
Thank you, thank you.

43:21.066 --> 43:24.167
Hey, kid, your ball.

43:25.737 --> 43:27.136
Your ball, kid.

43:27.138 --> 43:29.372
You are...
          Ryan Hawkes?

43:29.374 --> 43:31.007
Yes. Nice to meet you.

43:31.009 --> 43:32.742
Guys! It's Ryan Hawkes!

43:32.744 --> 43:34.110
I think we should probably go.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.679
No, no, no.
    You're going over there.

43:36.681 --> 43:38.881
Ryan, it's gonna make their
             year.

43:38.883 --> 43:41.684
Yeah, I don't know about that.
            Hey hey!

43:41.987 --> 43:43.219
[kid]
    Come play with us, man!

43:43.221 --> 43:45.688
Shut up, stupid.
     He can't play no more.

43:45.824 --> 43:47.824
Hey, I can play.

43:47.826 --> 43:50.693
Not full speed,
  but enough to teach you kids
        a thing or two.

43:50.695 --> 43:51.661
It's gonna make their year,
             right?

43:51.663 --> 43:53.163
Well, their month.

43:53.164 --> 43:54.664
Good enough. All right,
let's do it. Come on, kids.

43:54.666 --> 43:56.149
Let's go, come on, guys.

43:56.150 --> 43:57.633
Let's play, let's play.
    Let's go, come on, run!

44:03.008 --> 44:04.707
[Hawkes]
     All right, go, go, go!

44:26.331 --> 44:31.434
[kids cheering and celebrating]
          Yeah, yeah!

44:34.773 --> 44:39.375
Oh man. I tell you one thing,
      it's not fixed yet.

44:39.377 --> 44:44.847
-[Hawkes] But uh, you're right.
  -[Lana] It's gonna be fine.
       You'll get there.

44:52.357 --> 44:53.289
[Hawkes laughs]

44:53.291 --> 44:54.891
[Lana] Sorry, no ice.

44:54.893 --> 44:58.428
No, you're a lifesaver. Thank
    you. Oh, so much better.

45:01.800 --> 45:04.333
Ryan, that's a great thing you
did back there.

45:04.335 --> 45:05.852
Stop it.

45:05.853 --> 45:07.370
It was very cool.

45:07.372 --> 45:08.571
I'll tell you something,

45:08.572 --> 45:09.771
I haven't had that much fun
            playing

45:09.774 --> 45:10.940
since I don't know when.

45:13.878 --> 45:14.944
We should do more of that.

45:14.946 --> 45:16.045
Absolutely.

45:17.315 --> 45:18.948
Thank you for encouraging me.

45:20.785 --> 45:24.420
You probably get a lot better
         encouragement.

45:24.422 --> 45:25.354
What do you mean?

45:25.356 --> 45:27.123
Your fiancÃ©?

45:31.129 --> 45:32.395
Right.

45:35.934 --> 45:37.900
You look so good together.

45:41.005 --> 45:43.372
Yeah, don't we?

45:43.374 --> 45:47.276
Good for the magazines,
      good for the photos.

45:48.813 --> 45:51.080
Not so good for each other.

45:52.450 --> 45:57.086
Lana, I came out here because I
was uncertain about us, but...

45:59.958 --> 46:01.824
things are becoming clearer.

46:08.500 --> 46:10.433
Um, you know, before I forget...

46:10.435 --> 46:13.970
Could you please sign one more
       autograph, please?

46:13.972 --> 46:16.005
Sure, of course.

46:16.007 --> 46:17.373
His name is Danny.

46:17.375 --> 46:19.509
All right, would you take pea
    duty, please? Thank you.

46:20.411 --> 46:24.313
He once had the tryout for
  Zensin St. Petersburg boys.

46:24.315 --> 46:25.882
-Really?
     -Yeah. But now just...

46:25.884 --> 46:31.320
Plays for fun.
     Ryan, you're his hero.

46:33.158 --> 46:34.157
Poor guy.

46:34.159 --> 46:37.493
[Hawkes] Ryan... Hawkes.

46:39.831 --> 46:41.864
Give that to Danny, and uh...

46:41.866 --> 46:43.299
How do you know him?

46:44.135 --> 46:46.903
Um... Actually, Danny is um...

46:46.905 --> 46:47.804
[man] Excuse me, sir.

46:47.806 --> 46:49.305
Can I have a photo with you?

46:50.909 --> 46:52.842
Sure. Yeah, absolutely.

46:52.844 --> 47:00.349
Cool. All right.
     Very nice. All right,

47:00.351 --> 47:02.451
Thanks, pal. All right,
     you have a good night.

47:04.189 --> 47:05.288
Sorry.

47:10.195 --> 47:11.294
Have dinner with me.

47:12.964 --> 47:15.198
I'm serious.
  There's this amazing place,

47:15.200 --> 47:18.201
it's like five stars.
     Best meal on the Med.

47:18.203 --> 47:20.036
I don't think it's a good idea.

47:20.038 --> 47:24.240
This isn't one of your silly
       ship rules, is it?

47:24.943 --> 47:27.043
No, Ryan. It's not against
         ship's rules,

47:27.045 --> 47:29.312
but it is against my rules.

47:30.515 --> 47:34.884
It's just a dinner.
          As friends.

47:37.889 --> 47:39.188
Girls, please help.

47:39.190 --> 47:40.890
I have a dinner

47:40.892 --> 47:42.158
Oh my god, with him?

47:44.562 --> 47:46.529
Look at me,
      what am I gonna do?

47:46.531 --> 47:48.564
Don't worry, baby.
          We got you.

47:48.566 --> 47:50.266
-Is it tonight?
             -Yes!

48:30.308 --> 48:33.409
I'm telling you, Lana.
  I think he's the lucky one.

49:12.951 --> 49:15.384
Wow. You look...

49:18.022 --> 49:21.724
Uh, um...Sorry.
        This is for you.

49:25.029 --> 49:26.495
Thank you, Ryan.

49:27.999 --> 49:29.098
Shall we?

49:45.416 --> 49:48.517
[Hawkes] Careful.
            Thanks.

49:55.593 --> 49:59.195
Oh, no, that can't be it.
         No, no, that--

49:59.197 --> 50:01.630
Excuse me, excuse me, hey.

50:01.632 --> 50:03.432
-Excuse me.
              -Oh!

50:04.369 --> 50:06.369
[Hawkes] Hi. Uh...

50:06.371 --> 50:09.005
This place is meant to be
          five stars?

50:09.540 --> 50:10.506
It is.

50:11.042 --> 50:12.108
[Hawkes] It is.

50:13.544 --> 50:15.444
[Hawkes chuckles]
      I'm so sorry, Lana.

50:15.446 --> 50:17.046
This was meant to be nicer than
       the Four Seasons.

50:17.048 --> 50:18.647
We can go somewhere
      fancier if you want.

50:18.649 --> 50:20.516
Are you kidding me?
             Look.

50:20.518 --> 50:22.585
This is perfect, Ryan.

50:24.555 --> 50:26.055
What are your specials?

50:26.057 --> 50:28.557
Everything is special here,
             baby.

50:28.559 --> 50:29.658
See?

50:31.629 --> 50:34.263
[Hawkes] Great.
       Then two, please.

50:40.772 --> 50:42.571
This can't be more than
         two days old.

50:43.408 --> 50:44.407
Come on, Ryan.

50:44.409 --> 50:45.508
What?

50:46.244 --> 50:47.777
You sure you're okay with this?

50:47.779 --> 50:49.078
I love it.

51:04.295 --> 51:05.761
Oh hey, no, that's not fair.

51:05.763 --> 51:07.696
It's my turn now. Come on,
     hand it over. Come on.

51:07.698 --> 51:10.166
I'm trying to take pictures,
     not be in them, Ryan.

51:10.168 --> 51:12.101
Aw, that camera doesn't know
       what it's missing.

51:12.103 --> 51:14.470
Gosh. All right.

51:16.107 --> 51:17.106
Oh, whoa, whoa.
        Hide your plate.

51:17.108 --> 51:18.441
This might be its cousin.

51:18.443 --> 51:20.543
[laughing]

51:26.617 --> 51:32.421
You're right, you know.
          This place.

51:34.092 --> 51:35.191
It's perfect.

51:36.461 --> 51:39.829
Is it? You didn't get exactly
        what you wanted.

51:39.831 --> 51:42.465
But I got something even better.

51:50.775 --> 51:52.308
May I have this dance?

53:09.220 --> 53:11.487
This is Tchaikovsky.

53:12.223 --> 53:19.495
Tchaikovsky. All right.
     How do you say ocean?

53:19.497 --> 53:20.596
Okean.

53:21.566 --> 53:22.831
How do you say it?

53:23.234 --> 53:24.500
Okean.

53:26.671 --> 53:28.771
Okean. Okay, that's not so hard.

53:30.875 --> 53:31.974
[Hawkes] Stars.

53:33.411 --> 53:34.777
[Lana] Zvezdy.

53:44.855 --> 53:45.955
What?

53:49.760 --> 53:54.563
You have this ability to make me
      forget that I'm not
        [indiscernible].

53:56.734 --> 53:58.267
And see only the good.

54:54.659 --> 54:56.925
Ryan! Ryan, wake up!

54:56.927 --> 54:57.960
We missed the boat!

54:57.961 --> 54:58.994
So we'll get the next one.

54:58.996 --> 55:00.929
I'm gonna get fired! Please.

55:00.931 --> 55:04.033
Like hell you are!
   I'll get you on that boat.

55:09.340 --> 55:10.773
Hey. Hey!

55:10.775 --> 55:12.408
Hey, got room for two more?

55:12.410 --> 55:13.409
[man] Yes, yes I do.

55:13.411 --> 55:14.843
Great! All right!

55:32.029 --> 55:33.629
[Zimmer clears throat]

55:35.099 --> 55:37.032
Ms. Kalinina.

55:38.903 --> 55:41.437
A word in my office, please.

55:44.608 --> 55:49.578
Mr. Zimmer, I'm so sorry I
 missed role call. I overslept.

55:49.580 --> 55:52.047
Not in your room, you didn't.

55:52.049 --> 55:56.385
Your identity card was never
  scanned back in last night.

55:56.387 --> 55:59.521
Your friends try to cover for
   you, but I know exactly...

56:00.057 --> 56:01.557
Where you were.

56:01.559 --> 56:04.860
Amanda told me that you
absconded into the island

56:04.862 --> 56:06.695
with Mr. Hawkes.

56:06.697 --> 56:08.831
Highly inappropriate.

56:08.833 --> 56:11.367
Mr. Zimmer,
      it's not like that.

56:11.369 --> 56:15.704
Then I suppose his guest ID card
 was also never scanned back in
          last night.

56:15.706 --> 56:19.541
It's a pure coincidence.
 Fraternizing with the guests.

56:19.543 --> 56:21.944
It's an irreversible breach of
           contract.

56:21.946 --> 56:24.513
Mr. Zimmer, I need this job.
            Please!

56:24.515 --> 56:27.950
You should have thought about
        that beforehand.

56:27.952 --> 56:29.585
Pack your things.

56:32.590 --> 56:35.991
I want you off of the ship.
             Today.

56:40.765 --> 56:42.765
Fired, what? He can't do that.

56:42.767 --> 56:44.600
I'm gonna talk to the captain
           right now.

56:44.601 --> 56:46.434
No, Ryan, please.
    I'm embarrassed enough.

56:46.437 --> 56:48.237
What's this?

56:48.238 --> 56:50.038
The company has rescheduled
 to fly back home in a few days

56:50.040 --> 56:51.940
and they said I can stay there.

56:51.942 --> 56:53.909
Here? No, no, no,

56:53.910 --> 56:55.877
Lana, you are not staying
     at a place like this.

56:56.781 --> 57:03.051
I have an idea.
         Come with me.

57:04.922 --> 57:08.023
Please tell me he's the reason
    why she missed the boat.

57:08.726 --> 57:11.160
We really are fairy
          godmothers.

57:14.632 --> 57:15.597
[scoffs]

57:16.200 --> 57:17.933
[Amanda] What?

57:17.935 --> 57:19.034
Argh!

57:38.589 --> 57:39.955
Not too bad, huh?

57:40.491 --> 57:41.190
[Carles] Hey, amigo.

57:41.192 --> 57:42.825
[Hawkes in Spanish]

57:44.995 --> 57:47.863
How is the goal machine?
   The leg is looking strong.

57:47.865 --> 57:49.531
Ah, gracias. It's, it's getting
          there, man.

57:49.533 --> 57:51.083
It's getting there.

57:51.084 --> 57:52.634
Last time I saw you would've
        been that, uh...

57:52.636 --> 57:54.636
That charity match at Camp Nou.
  You know, I think you had me

57:54.638 --> 57:56.505
in your pocket the whole game.
   I didn't get a shot away.

57:56.507 --> 57:58.240
I remember, in my pocket.

57:58.609 --> 58:00.809
Oh, Carles, this is Lana. Lana,
     this is Carles Puyol.

58:00.811 --> 58:02.044
Barca legend.

58:02.046 --> 58:03.045
Pleasure to meet you, Lana.

58:03.047 --> 58:04.463
Nice to meet you.

58:04.464 --> 58:05.880
She's been stranded for
         a couple days

58:05.883 --> 58:07.533
so I'm just keeping her
            company.

58:07.534 --> 58:09.184
It's amazing here.
       I come every year.

58:09.186 --> 58:11.253
Yeah, I know.
       I do miss it here.

58:11.255 --> 58:13.222
You know what?
       I think I'll stay.

58:13.958 --> 58:15.624
You still have three days left
          on the ship.

58:15.626 --> 58:17.526
Eh, forget it.
     I'll send for my bags.

58:17.528 --> 58:18.827
I mean, what am I gonna
         do over there?

58:18.829 --> 58:19.995
All the cool people are here.

58:19.996 --> 58:21.162
-[Carles] Yes, they are.
-[Vanesa] Hi, hi!

58:21.165 --> 58:22.865
Me and my wife,
    we'll be here all week.

58:22.867 --> 58:23.799
-Really?
             -Yeah

58:23.801 --> 58:25.167
We should grab dinner sometime.

58:25.169 --> 58:29.705
That's cool, yeah. Let's do it.
I think that'd be a great idea.

58:30.074 --> 58:32.174
Ms. Kalinina,
      your room is ready.

58:33.043 --> 58:34.109
[Hawkes] That's you.

58:34.111 --> 58:35.577
Very nice to meet you.

58:39.984 --> 58:41.083
Thank you.

59:48.686 --> 59:49.651
[Lana screams]

59:50.621 --> 59:53.722
[laughing]

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.033
Well, here we are.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.705
Well, I'm uh, right next door,
so just let me know if you need
           anything.

01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:47.643
Ice, wine, sponge bath.

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:50.979
Good night, Ryan.
And thank you.

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.914
For what?

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:57.653
-For being a gentleman.
            -[sighs]

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:33.288
[Carles and Hawkes
          in Spanish]

01:01:51.442 --> 01:01:55.811
Hi guys! What's going on?
          How are you?

01:01:55.813 --> 01:01:58.714
<i> We got the money you sent.</i>
           <i> Thank you.</i>

01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:01.750
<i> How is the ship?</i>

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:04.785
It's great. I'm in Halkidiki
   right now but I'll be home
         in a few days.

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:09.891
Halkidiki? Aren't you supposed
       to be in Mykonos?

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.893
Yes, that's where the ship is.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.161
[Marina] <i> Lana?</i>

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:15.097
Is everything okay?

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:16.765
Everything's great.

01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:22.337
[Marina in Russian]

01:02:22.339 --> 01:02:25.474
[Danny in Russian]

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:29.044
[Marina in Russian]

01:02:36.854 --> 01:02:38.987
[Marina in Russian]

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:43.158
[Lana in Russian]

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:10.152
Room service.

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:15.490
You okay?

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:19.494
Hm.

01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:23.899
Well, I have something that
      might cheer you up.

01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:29.838
I uh went back to the beach
       today and I uh...

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.973
Realized I forgot something
             there.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.943
Surprise.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.981
-Ryan...
             -What?

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:45.487
You know what you're saying by
    giving this to me right?

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:47.923
Of course I do.

01:03:47.925 --> 01:03:51.259
But you're engaged.
     And my life is a mess.

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:56.464
I took this trip alone for
           a reason.

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:58.934
Elise and I are not
     meant to be together.

01:03:58.936 --> 01:04:00.001
No, this isn't right.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:01.436
What, what?

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:03.505
-Normal people don't do this.
    -We're not normal, Lana.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:07.409
[Lana] You're not, but I am.
  We come from two completely
       different worlds.

01:04:07.411 --> 01:04:09.044
You gotta stop thinking like
             that.

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:15.016
You are more amazing than
   any woman I have ever met.

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:18.854
-I have to tell you something.
          -All right.

01:04:21.258 --> 01:04:23.625
Legally, I'm still married.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.163
Okay.

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:32.868
I wanted to tell you earlier.

01:04:35.072 --> 01:04:37.272
Why didn't you?

01:04:37.274 --> 01:04:39.241
Because I know what this is
            for you.

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:40.876
It's fun. It's recess.

01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:43.045
No, it's not.

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:45.213
Now, I admit I was a confused
  man, when I stepped on that
             boat.

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:48.216
But I stepped off it a better
  one. That's because of you,
             Lana.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:51.052
-Ryan, please don't do
          this to me.
           -Do what?

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:53.221
You only know me for five days.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:57.425
Five days? I've played soccer
 for 20 years and in five days,

01:04:57.427 --> 01:05:01.429
you made me forget it even
exists. We are meant to be
           together.

01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:02.931
Ryan, no.

01:06:34.124 --> 01:06:38.426
I realized, I got no way to get
in touch with you. I don't have
your email or your phone number.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:46.067
Ryan, what if we go back to our
lives and you realize it wasn't
          meant to be?

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:49.671
No, Lana, no.
         It was. It is.

01:06:49.673 --> 01:06:54.676
Then in two months, if you still
 feel the same, then come find
              me.

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:57.512
What do you mean, two months,
   Lana? What are you talking
             about?

01:06:57.514 --> 01:07:02.517
We need that time to go back to
our lives, to do what needs to
            be done.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:05.587
And then, if you still feel the
         same, then...

01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:07.722
Come find me in St. Petersburg.

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:19.134
Alexander Column in Palace
   Square. May 25th at 8 p.m.

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:22.504
Can't we just... email?

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:28.043
No. If we're there, we're there.
      But if not, then...

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:30.045
This would...

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:32.180
Still be a great memory.

01:07:32.516 --> 01:07:33.648
Yeah.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:45.727
The Alexander Column,
Palace Square, May 25th, 8 p.m.

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:47.395
I'll be there.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:56.071
[Lana] That's for you.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:08.416

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:54.295
[Lana]
I missed you so much!

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.763
[Danny]
     Mom, I can't breathe!

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:02.504
What's this?

01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:05.807
This? Um, do you like it?

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:07.675
It's pretty.

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:12.180
-Mom, look! We made for you.
  -Thank you so much, Granny!

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:14.733
Well, how was it?

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:16.651
The good news is I don't have
        to leave again.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.586
Yay!

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:23.323
[Lana in Russian]

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.529
Look, I've got something
            for you.

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:31.166
I got you...

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.300
This!

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:34.335
What? Ryan Hawkes?

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:35.837
Mm-hm!

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.671
He was on my ship!

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:40.408
What? Ryan Hawkes on your ship?

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:41.341
Mm-hm!

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:42.810
What was he like?

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:46.648
He's, um, kind.

01:09:46.917 --> 01:09:49.216

[Ruslan in Russian]

01:13:58.835 --> 01:14:00.568
[Danny] Alina, look at this!

01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:03.471
[Alina laughs]

01:14:08.178 --> 01:14:10.111
[kid in Russian]

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:15.750
[Marina in Russian]

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:22.590
[Danny in Russian]

01:14:30.099 --> 01:14:32.200
[Lana in Russian]

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:43.478
Come on, let's go.

01:14:59.095 --> 01:15:03.130
[exhales] I'm tempted not to
  believe it, but your results
             show,

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:05.233
the soft tissue is fully
   healed and the prosthetics

01:15:05.235 --> 01:15:08.536
Is working as it should.
     Your range of motion,

01:15:08.538 --> 01:15:12.039
it's extraordinary considering
  it's only been a few months.

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:14.675
So I'll be able to play again.
              Soon

01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:18.012
There's still a long way to go.
     But there's a chance,

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:20.648
if you stick on your rehab
        schedule and...

01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:21.983
You listen to her.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.021
Yeah. Whatever it takes

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:24.745
[Billy] So?

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:26.113
[Lang] You.

01:16:26.115 --> 01:16:27.949
[Lang] What the hell were you
           thinking?

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:33.087
You told me he was getting his
          head right.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.222
Now I see what you
          really mean.

01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:40.211
All right.

01:16:40.212 --> 01:16:44.198
Look, when I get back on that
pitch, you are gonna beg me
            to stay.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.333
Prove it.

01:16:49.606 --> 01:16:51.172
Let's get out of here, Billy.

01:16:56.713 --> 01:17:00.348
You jealous?
            [laughs]

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.618
Lang was right about one thing.

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:08.022
If you wanna go to the World
  Cup, you can only prove your
      fitness by playing.

01:17:08.024 --> 01:17:11.158
You need Lang on your side for
        that to happen.

01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:15.129
For god's sakes why didn't you
  tell me about those pictures
            sooner?

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:17.020
I couldn't done something that--

01:17:17.021 --> 01:17:18.910
-I, I, Billy, I didn't--
-Could've contained the damage.

01:17:18.911 --> 01:17:20.800
I didn't know about the
  pictures, or that there was
      gonna be any damage.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:23.971
What's the point?
       Who cares, anyway?
 I mean, so I met some girl...

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:28.743
Lang! Lang wants you focused.
      I want you focused.
       Oh, come on, now.

01:17:28.745 --> 01:17:31.646
You took a shot at one gold
  digger. Last thing you need
     right now is another.

01:17:31.648 --> 01:17:33.881
Hey, hey, hey. You have no idea
   what you're talking about.

01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:35.182
[Billy]
    Why are you doing that?

01:17:35.184 --> 01:17:39.687
Don't bother calling for a
        couple of days.
I won't be reachable.

01:17:39.856 --> 01:17:43.691
Why? Where are you going now?
      Atlantis? The moon?
         Middle Earth?

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:47.928
You just make sure you're
  back for your next session,

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:50.297
or it won't just be Lang that's
         done with you.

01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:57.138
Yikes.

01:18:47.256 --> 01:18:48.572
[Hawkes] Hey.

01:18:48.573 --> 01:18:49.889
[Conciere] Welcome to
    Grand Hotel Europe, sir.

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:50.791
[Hawkes] How are you doing?

01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:10.077
-[Danny] Alina!
         -[Lana] Guys!

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:13.414
You know the rules.
 No playing ball in the house!

01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:16.083
Danny, if Granny was here,
      she would kill you!

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.786
Does that mean we can
        go play outside?

01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:22.089
Okay, you can go but stay close
       so I can see you.

01:19:22.825 --> 01:19:26.193
Come on, Alina!
  I'm going to kick your butt!

01:19:26.195 --> 01:19:28.262
[Alina in Russian]

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:37.505
Wow.

01:19:52.789 --> 01:19:53.921
White nights.

01:20:16.212 --> 01:20:18.345
[Alina in Russian]

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:05.626
[Alina screaming] Lana!

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:16.604
Danny!

01:21:20.176 --> 01:21:23.310
[Lana in Russian]

01:21:41.964 --> 01:21:43.230
Hey!

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:44.365
Lana!

01:21:46.903 --> 01:21:48.035
Sorry.

01:22:05.121 --> 01:22:10.224
[Doctor in Russian]

01:22:57.273 --> 01:22:59.406
[Lana in Russian]

01:23:27.069 --> 01:23:31.138
[Marina in Russian]

01:26:33.923 --> 01:26:35.689
Yeah, it's Ryan Hawkes.

01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:38.192
Any messages for me?

01:26:43.399 --> 01:26:44.798
Mm-hm.

01:27:13.596 --> 01:27:15.729
[Marina in Russian]

01:27:26.609 --> 01:27:27.608
Mama?

01:27:27.610 --> 01:27:32.613
Danny.
      How are you feeling?

01:27:32.615 --> 01:27:34.615
I'm scared.

01:27:36.352 --> 01:27:41.355
It's okay to be scared.
      You had an accident.

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:43.557
[Marina in Russian]

01:28:32.374 --> 01:28:34.675
I'm gonna need to
        extend my stay.

01:28:49.425 --> 01:28:50.891
Look, if I was trying to
        find a woman...

01:28:50.893 --> 01:28:54.728
In this city,
     where should I start?

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:57.564
Red Light District?

01:28:57.566 --> 01:29:00.600
Oh, no, no. [chuckles]
    No, it's not like that.

01:29:00.602 --> 01:29:05.605
I mean, I know this person.
    I just don't know where
          to find her.

01:29:05.607 --> 01:29:08.008
I'm not even sure she wants
          to be found.

01:29:10.346 --> 01:29:12.012
You got a phonebook here
           somewhere?

01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:13.914
A what?

01:29:13.916 --> 01:29:15.615
A phonebook.

01:29:15.617 --> 01:29:17.651
You know, names,
   phone numbers, addresses,
         a phone book.

01:29:17.653 --> 01:29:19.786
This doesn't exist in Russia.

01:29:19.988 --> 01:29:22.356
[scoffs]
        You're kidding.

01:29:22.358 --> 01:29:23.490
No, really.

01:29:33.068 --> 01:29:40.440
No, no I didn't. I uh, yeah,
   yeah I booked that flight.
   That's uh, I know, I know.

01:29:40.442 --> 01:29:44.077
I'm uh, I'm gone this week.

01:29:44.079 --> 01:29:49.616
No, I mean it.
      Yeah, I'm done here.

01:29:49.618 --> 01:29:52.686
Thanks, man. See you soon.

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:11.865
Hey, hey, hold up.

01:31:11.867 --> 01:31:16.870
Is that where Zenit plays?
   Can we stop there, please?

01:31:26.648 --> 01:31:27.848
[doctor] Lana.

01:31:30.619 --> 01:31:34.754
[doctor in Russian]

01:32:17.666 --> 01:32:18.765
[Danny] Mom?

01:32:18.767 --> 01:32:20.600
[Lana] Hi, baby.

01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:26.840
Hi.

01:32:28.243 --> 01:32:29.976
[Danny indiscernible]

01:32:31.547 --> 01:32:37.551
Of course. And I have good news.
You'll be out of here very soon.

01:32:37.553 --> 01:32:39.252
We're gonna go home.

01:32:39.254 --> 01:32:41.655
Am I going to walk again?

01:32:41.657 --> 01:32:43.290
Yes, you will.

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:48.662
[Hawkes] I was hoping you could
     help me find somebody.

01:32:51.233 --> 01:32:52.899
Do you know the boy's name?

01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:53.967
Danny.

01:32:53.969 --> 01:32:55.101
Danny what?

01:32:56.905 --> 01:32:58.038
Uh...

01:32:58.674 --> 01:32:59.806
Um...

01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:04.911
[coach] Do you know age,
           position?

01:33:04.913 --> 01:33:07.080
[sigh] We try out...

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:09.082
Hundreds of boys each year.

01:33:09.084 --> 01:33:11.985
We keep some information,
      but we are not KGB.

01:33:11.987 --> 01:33:14.187
[chuckles] Yeah.

01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:19.693
Danny's a very popular name, you
see. Without that information,
    it's almost impossible.

01:33:19.695 --> 01:33:20.994
[Hawkes] May I?

01:33:35.043 --> 01:33:37.143
[Billy's voicemail]
         This is Billy.
      You know what to do.

01:33:37.145 --> 01:33:39.879
Hey, Billy, uh yeah, it's me.

01:33:39.881 --> 01:33:44.618
Look, I just want to apologize
  for, um, skipping out on you
             again.

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:47.921
I'm in Russia, but don't worry,
    I'm gonna catch a plane
           back home.

01:33:53.228 --> 01:33:54.894
Vladislav Radimov?

01:33:54.896 --> 01:33:56.129
Hey.

01:33:56.131 --> 01:33:58.965
What is the great Ryan Hawkes
        doing at Zenit?

01:33:58.967 --> 01:34:04.170
Ha. Uh, look, it's kind of
    complicated. I'll uh...

01:34:04.172 --> 01:34:05.672
What about you?

01:34:05.674 --> 01:34:07.140
Somebody's birthday?

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:10.310
No, this is for kids in
           hospital.

01:34:10.312 --> 01:34:12.212
Make-A-Wish Foundation.

01:34:12.214 --> 01:34:13.279
Heh.

01:34:13.281 --> 01:34:16.282
Join us.

01:34:16.283 --> 01:34:19.284
Oh, uh, look I, I'd love to,
      but I gotta get on a
          flight soon.

01:34:19.287 --> 01:34:23.823
It would make kids very happy.
     It would probably make
          their year.

01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:25.225
Wait, what did you just say?

01:34:25.227 --> 01:34:28.094
I said, it would probably make
          their year.

01:34:28.096 --> 01:34:29.095
[chuckles]

01:34:30.866 --> 01:34:32.699
[Hawkes indiscernible]

01:34:32.701 --> 01:34:34.034
Nice place you got here.

01:34:34.169 --> 01:34:36.703
You spend much time in
  St. Petersburg, Mr. Hawkes?

01:34:36.705 --> 01:34:39.005
Oh, just a couple of days.

01:34:39.006 --> 01:34:41.306
I was hoping to spend more
  time, but it looks like I'm
     gonna be heading home.

01:34:41.309 --> 01:34:43.910
[nurse in Russian]

01:34:51.319 --> 01:34:55.121
My colleague tells me that we
  have a big fan of yours in a
       neighboring ward.

01:34:55.123 --> 01:34:58.258
Would you mind going first to
   his room to say hi to him?

01:35:03.965 --> 01:35:06.933
Knock-knock! Hey kiddo,
          how are you?

01:35:06.935 --> 01:35:09.402
You're... Ryan Hawkes!

01:35:09.404 --> 01:35:12.205
Yeah, that's me.

01:35:12.207 --> 01:35:14.741
Poster and everything.
            [laughs]

01:35:14.743 --> 01:35:16.209
Real fan, huh?

01:35:16.411 --> 01:35:18.945
You speak English, huh?

01:35:18.947 --> 01:35:20.380
Good.

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:21.814
It's gonna be a lot better
        than my Russian.

01:35:22.718 --> 01:35:24.384
Hey, um,

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:26.051
I heard you hurt yourself
  playing ball. Is that right?

01:35:26.054 --> 01:35:31.891
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.
  I know how it feels, though,
   believe me. How long ago?

01:35:31.893 --> 01:35:33.993
A few days ago. May 25.

01:35:33.995 --> 01:35:39.432
The 25th? Huh. No kidding.
      Bad day for me, too.

01:35:39.434 --> 01:35:43.436
Oh, not... not like you.
     Never mind. [chuckles]

01:35:48.977 --> 01:35:52.979
Hey, tell me something.
     When you get better...

01:35:52.981 --> 01:35:57.450
How would you like to come to a
 game with me in LA, my treat?

01:35:57.452 --> 01:35:59.753
Really? You invite me?

01:35:59.755 --> 01:36:01.571
Yeah.

01:36:01.572 --> 01:36:03.388
You bet. I would love that.
             Truly.

01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:06.259
[doctor clears throat]

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:07.761
[Hawkes]
         Oh, uh, yeah.

01:36:07.763 --> 01:36:11.931
Um, sorry, I better get going,
           but uh...

01:36:11.933 --> 01:36:16.035
You rest up, get back playing
again, and these guys are gonna
       get your details.

01:36:16.037 --> 01:36:17.871
See you in LA, all right?

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:21.274
Oh, hey, you uh, want me to sign
     your ball before I go?

01:36:21.276 --> 01:36:22.275
Yeah!

01:36:22.778 --> 01:36:23.943
Awesome. All right.

01:36:23.945 --> 01:36:25.779
Okay, so...

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:38.425
Where'd you get this?

01:36:38.426 --> 01:36:40.560
My mom brought it. She said
     she met you on a ship.

01:36:41.196 --> 01:36:43.263
Your mom?

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.367
What's your mom's name?

01:36:47.369 --> 01:36:48.868
Lana.

01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:53.406
And you're Danny?

01:36:53.875 --> 01:36:55.275
How did you know?

01:36:55.877 --> 01:36:58.545
Hey, tell me something.
     Where's your mom now?

01:36:58.547 --> 01:37:00.246
Wait, you know her?

01:37:00.248 --> 01:37:04.317
I've been looking for her, yeah.
    Probably my whole life.

01:37:05.153 --> 01:37:07.287
Okay...

01:37:07.589 --> 01:37:10.323
She left a while ago.

01:37:10.325 --> 01:37:14.294
So she's probably crossing
 the bridge, if she didn't get
        to the Metro...

01:37:14.296 --> 01:37:16.830
Okay, okay... Look after that.

01:37:16.832 --> 01:37:18.364
Wait, Ryan. Where are you going?

01:37:18.366 --> 01:37:20.567
I'll be right back.
    I'll see you soon, kid.

01:37:50.131 --> 01:37:51.264
Lana! Lana!

01:37:51.266 --> 01:37:53.216
[guard in Russian]

01:37:53.217 --> 01:37:55.167
No, no, no. I have to get
 across. You don't understand!

01:37:55.170 --> 01:37:58.004
-I have to go!
      -[guard in Russian]

01:38:01.076 --> 01:38:02.175
[guard in Russian]

01:38:03.178 --> 01:38:05.578
Lana! Lana!

01:38:10.919 --> 01:38:11.451
Lana!

01:38:11.453 --> 01:38:14.254
[guard in Russian]

01:38:23.064 --> 01:38:24.197
Lana!

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:26.933
LANA!

01:38:52.928 --> 01:38:54.060
Lana!

01:38:58.934 --> 01:38:59.933
Lana!

01:39:06.141 --> 01:39:08.708
How... how'd you find me?

01:39:08.710 --> 01:39:10.076
Danny helped.

01:39:10.078 --> 01:39:12.078
Danny?

01:40:26.721 --> 01:40:29.255
[announcer] Ryan Hawkes, a
    literal walking miracle,
             folks,

01:40:29.257 --> 01:40:34.360
is taking the field for Team USA
  for the first time since his
   career-threatening injury.

01:40:34.362 --> 01:40:36.396
[color commentator]
 Twenty-five goals last season,

01:40:36.398 --> 01:40:38.965
I'm sure Hawkes will be
satisfied just to play

01:40:38.966 --> 01:40:41.533
25 minutes of this World Cup,
 and who knows if his leg will
           hold out?

01:40:41.536 --> 01:40:43.536
[announcer 2] Hawkes still has
   a lot to prove after that
           leg break.

01:40:43.538 --> 01:40:46.439
And until he starts scoring
     again, the jury's out.

01:41:48.536 --> 01:41:49.836
Come on, Ryan!

01:42:39.854 --> 01:42:41.854
Go, go, go!

01:42:41.856 --> 01:42:42.855
[Giorgio] Do it!

01:43:43.218 --> 01:43:48.354
[crowd chanting]
    HAWKES! HAWKES! HAWKES!

01:43:49.305 --> 01:43:55.180
