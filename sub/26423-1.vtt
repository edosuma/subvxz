03:45.440 --> 03:49.110
<i>Last week 28
year-old Steven Johnson</i>

03:49.112 --> 03:51.177
<i>and 30 year-old Stephanie Tramer</i>

03:51.179 --> 03:53.481
<i>were found bludgeoned
in a local woodland.</i>

03:54.148 --> 03:57.751
Prime suspect and local
Dunwich resident Jack Cain,

03:57.753 --> 04:00.920
who police arrested 24
hours after the discovery

04:00.922 --> 04:03.591
of the bodies,
is currently in court today

04:03.593 --> 04:06.060
attending a plea
and trial preparation hearing.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.160
<i>The hearing is expected</i>

04:08.162 --> 04:09.962
<i>to be somewhat of a formality</i>

04:09.964 --> 04:11.831
<i>where the key
facts are presented</i>

04:11.833 --> 04:14.003
<i>and a plea is made
by the defendant.</i>

04:14.403 --> 04:17.471
<i>Should that plea be
not guilty as expected,</i>

04:17.473 --> 04:19.574
<i>a trial date will then be set.</i>

04:21.009 --> 04:25.778
Of these 16 stab wounds,
five by themselves

04:25.780 --> 04:27.316
would have proved fatal.

04:28.449 --> 04:29.650
Steve Johnson...

04:30.586 --> 04:34.824
received 13 stab wounds,
mainly to the chest.

04:36.225 --> 04:39.429
However, there were several
abrasions to the palms

04:39.862 --> 04:44.467
of his hands... which would
suggest defensive wounds.

04:45.768 --> 04:49.472
The fatal blow was a
stab wound to the aorta,

04:49.739 --> 04:53.076
the large blood vessel
coming from the heart.

04:54.376 --> 04:55.311
Your Honor...

04:56.311 --> 04:59.315
due to the heinous nature
of this crime,

05:00.449 --> 05:04.586
and the circumstantial
evidence against Mr. Cain

05:05.420 --> 05:07.855
and his lack of alibi,

05:08.824 --> 05:11.927
there is sufficient
evidence for prosecution.

05:13.028 --> 05:14.495
Anything further to add?

05:15.030 --> 05:16.999
No, that is all, Your Honor.

05:24.372 --> 05:25.340
Mr. Cain.

05:26.641 --> 05:30.112
Before we proceed,
I must advise you

05:30.578 --> 05:34.615
for the second time that
given the very serious charges

05:34.617 --> 05:38.853
it is in your best interest
to enlist legal counsel

05:38.855 --> 05:39.888
in this matter.

05:42.158 --> 05:44.290
I'll be representing myself,
Your Honor.

05:44.292 --> 05:45.494
I have nothing to hide.

05:46.895 --> 05:47.764
As you wish.

05:49.297 --> 05:51.199
Before we move to a plea...

05:53.302 --> 05:55.638
do you have any evidence
you wish to submit

05:56.204 --> 06:00.041
that would contradict what
the prosecution has presented?

06:11.920 --> 06:13.054
Not at this time.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.458
I'd just like to enter a plea
of not guilty.

06:19.761 --> 06:20.662
As you wish.

06:32.006 --> 06:35.578
Would both counsels
approach the bench, please?

06:51.225 --> 06:54.730
The grievous nature of
this crime is clear.

06:57.465 --> 07:00.733
All of the evidence you have collected

07:00.735 --> 07:05.974
against Mr. Cain was obtained
after an illegal arrest.

07:06.609 --> 07:08.208
What?

07:11.379 --> 07:12.447
Order in the court!

07:16.085 --> 07:19.388
I have no choice but to move
to dismiss the case.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.259
Your Honor, you can't
possibly let this man go.

07:24.025 --> 07:25.561
He is a danger to us all.

07:26.227 --> 07:28.928
Then perhaps the police
should have read him his rights

07:28.930 --> 07:29.898
when they arrested him.

07:32.634 --> 07:36.204
The search of Mr. Cain's car,
his house, the interviews,

07:36.905 --> 07:40.074
all of it is now
inadmissible as evidence.

07:40.542 --> 07:42.277
This case is dismissed.

07:42.544 --> 07:44.110
- Guilty!
- I order the accused to

07:44.112 --> 07:45.711
be released in immediate
fashion.

07:45.713 --> 07:47.481
You murderer!
You murdered my son!

07:47.749 --> 07:50.051
You murdered his sister!

07:50.951 --> 07:52.622
You know you're guilty!

08:01.631 --> 08:03.665
You didn't read him his rights.

08:03.965 --> 08:05.833
What the fuck is this,
amateur hour?

08:05.835 --> 08:08.537
I chased him down.
We had armed police out.

08:08.937 --> 08:12.307
In all the commotion I just
made a mistake, all right?

08:12.675 --> 08:14.410
Fuckin' right you made
a mistake.

08:15.110 --> 08:18.813
And my son and this poor kid's
sister won't see justice.

08:19.247 --> 08:22.382
Scum like Cain won't keep
their nose clean for long.

08:22.384 --> 08:25.420
Now when he steps out of line,
I'll be there to take him down.

08:26.321 --> 08:27.822
You think he'll kill again?

08:28.790 --> 08:31.527
I don't know,
but he's capable of it.

08:32.028 --> 08:33.462
Well now we're all in danger.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.265
Look, I'll keep this town safe.

08:36.832 --> 08:38.000
Yeah.

08:38.933 --> 08:40.702
Like the good job you
did the first time.

08:41.034 --> 08:43.171
- Now fuck you, Joe.
- Listen!

08:43.671 --> 08:47.773
If that scumbag hurts anyone
else, heads are going to roll.

08:47.775 --> 08:49.308
- Look man...
- You made

08:49.310 --> 08:52.044
the biggest mistake of your
career here, plain and simple.

08:52.046 --> 08:54.148
- You want my resignation?
- You offering it?

08:54.382 --> 08:57.085
- Do I have any other option?
- There are always options, Frank.

08:57.553 --> 08:59.422
Doing your job is
an option.

09:00.890 --> 09:03.059
What is your job, Frank?
Can you tell me that?

09:05.260 --> 09:07.461
Uphold the law,
keep the town safe.

09:07.463 --> 09:09.665
Keep this town safe, precisely.

09:10.464 --> 09:12.499
We all wanted
justice in this case.

09:12.501 --> 09:14.169
The law has not given us that.

09:14.770 --> 09:17.669
Does that mean that the
duty to protect Dunwich

09:17.671 --> 09:19.040
goes out the window?

09:20.208 --> 09:21.077
No.

09:22.611 --> 09:25.381
Johnny, you tell me son, what
does justice mean for you?

09:28.617 --> 09:32.387
I wanna see Cain suffer
for what he did to my sister.

09:33.988 --> 09:35.355
What about you, Joe?

09:35.357 --> 09:38.627
No parent should ever bury
their own child.

09:39.828 --> 09:40.728
It's not natural.

09:41.429 --> 09:44.634
And that piece of shit deserves
to die for what he's done!

09:47.234 --> 09:48.203
I agree.

09:53.541 --> 09:54.709
So what are you saying, man?

09:55.044 --> 09:57.179
Well, all of us go back
a long way, Frank.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.748
I may be the Mayor of this
town but I'm also your friend.

10:01.116 --> 10:03.052
Friends should help each
other, don't you think?

10:06.188 --> 10:07.122
Oh yeah.

10:08.556 --> 10:11.526
So, I'm gonna help you
save your job, Frank.

10:12.493 --> 10:14.029
Joe, Johnny...

10:16.030 --> 10:17.232
we're gonna get you justice.

10:20.435 --> 10:21.970
And how do you
propose to do that?

10:30.444 --> 10:31.414
<i>Zombies.</i>

10:33.247 --> 10:34.281
<i>Yes.</i>

10:34.882 --> 10:36.251
<i>They are my servants.</i>

10:39.554 --> 10:41.989
<i>This soul killer takes men</i>

10:41.991 --> 10:43.324
<i>from their graves...</i>

10:44.492 --> 10:46.127
<i>to be his slaves.</i>

10:50.165 --> 10:53.334
<i>His instruments of terror,</i>

10:53.801 --> 10:55.934
<i>and now this fiend plots...</i>

10:55.936 --> 10:57.839
<i>...to possess a woman.</i>

11:04.011 --> 11:05.113
<i>Yeah, master?</i>

11:08.883 --> 11:11.217
<i>This soul killer takes men</i>

11:11.219 --> 11:15.824
<i>from their graves...
to be his slaves...</i>

11:20.463 --> 11:22.798
<i>...his instruments of terror,</i>

11:23.165 --> 11:26.836
<i>and now this fiend plots
to possess a woman.</i>

11:31.405 --> 11:32.675
<i>How beastly.</i>

12:03.405 --> 12:05.174
The fuck is this,
a Halloween party?

12:06.907 --> 12:08.710
It's time to pay
for what you did, Cain.

12:12.447 --> 12:13.582
You got something to say?

12:15.617 --> 12:18.920
Look down at me
and you see a fool.

12:19.954 --> 12:21.922
Look up at me and you see a God.

12:22.391 --> 12:25.991
Look straight at me
and you see yourself.

12:28.463 --> 12:29.430
I'm not like you.

12:30.466 --> 12:31.500
None of us are.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.999
Pull that trigger
and you become guilty

12:34.001 --> 12:35.371
of what you accuse me.

12:36.038 --> 12:38.206
The question you have
to ask yourselves is,

12:38.873 --> 12:40.843
can you live
with taking a life?

12:42.343 --> 12:43.645
I'll not only live with it,

12:44.411 --> 12:47.279
I'll wake up smiling
every fucking day

12:47.281 --> 12:48.283
knowing you're gone.

12:49.251 --> 12:50.616
That gonna bring
your kid back?

12:50.618 --> 12:53.254
Shut the fuck up.

13:05.133 --> 13:10.104
No.
Are you tryin' to humiliate me?

13:12.372 --> 13:13.309
No.

13:14.575 --> 13:15.577
I'm tryin' to kill you.

13:20.449 --> 13:23.117
Do it, Johnny.
Do it for your sister.

13:23.952 --> 13:24.886
Do it!

13:53.848 --> 13:54.949
Get the shovels.

14:15.503 --> 14:18.272
This goes without saying but,
I'm going to say it anyway.

14:19.241 --> 14:21.843
We never speak about
this to anyone, ever.

14:23.311 --> 14:26.047
If anyone asks, Cain left town.

14:27.082 --> 14:28.016
We all agreed on that?

14:30.319 --> 14:31.219
Yeah.

14:32.253 --> 14:33.154
Johnny?

14:37.525 --> 14:38.559
What?

14:40.996 --> 14:43.365
We never speak about this...

14:43.998 --> 14:45.733
to anyone ever.

14:46.968 --> 14:47.870
Agreed?

14:54.541 --> 14:55.576
Agreed.

15:03.550 --> 15:05.054
You've been awfully quiet,
Frank.

15:09.857 --> 15:12.593
Promise that you never
tell anyone about this

15:13.428 --> 15:14.596
for as long as you live.

15:16.665 --> 15:17.866
Let me hear you say it.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.675
Fine.

15:28.208 --> 15:29.743
I promise not to tell anyone

15:29.745 --> 15:32.448
about this,
for as long as I live.

16:09.984 --> 16:11.817
We're now one
minute after midnight

16:11.819 --> 16:13.719
and it's officially
the day when the veil

16:13.721 --> 16:16.258
between the living
and the dead is at its thinnest.

16:16.724 --> 16:20.192
This is WKB Dunwich and I'm
Jennifer Hollister signing off,

16:20.194 --> 16:22.097
dear listeners, with
this golden oldie.

16:23.264 --> 16:24.466

You were right,
you piece of shit.

17:43.511 --> 17:45.646
I couldn't live with it.

18:37.866 --> 18:41.936
Life is
just a dream for the dead.

18:54.915 --> 18:57.085
- Hey Dad.
- Morning.

18:57.418 --> 18:58.352
You look like hell.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.354
Thanks, I needed that.

19:01.289 --> 19:03.925
- You strugglin' to sleep?
- Yeah, what else is new?

19:04.893 --> 19:06.495
Would ya like me
to make you something to eat?

19:07.328 --> 19:09.763
No, I'll be fine. I'll grab
something on the way to work.

19:10.130 --> 19:10.965
Fast food?

19:11.933 --> 19:13.635
Come on, Dad, I'll
make you some eggs.

19:15.069 --> 19:16.704
You're too good to me,
you know that?

19:18.139 --> 19:19.373
I thought you'd quit.

19:19.840 --> 19:20.741
I'm trying.

19:21.341 --> 19:22.976
Not very hard
by the looks of it.

19:23.578 --> 19:26.048
I guess it helps
with the stress of the job.

19:27.883 --> 19:29.651
You're going
to the Halloween party tonight?

19:31.419 --> 19:32.587
I don't think so.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.122
Maybe you should.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.525
Might help you de-stress a bit.

19:37.125 --> 19:38.193
You working tonight?

19:39.493 --> 19:40.428
I'm off.

19:41.495 --> 19:43.264
Was thinkin' I could
head over to the party.

19:44.565 --> 19:45.467
Could be fun.

19:46.399 --> 19:47.435
Do you remember that word?

19:48.235 --> 19:49.804
Fun?

19:50.739 --> 19:52.641
I guess I haven't had
much time for it lately.

20:03.819 --> 20:04.819
Hollister.

20:05.286 --> 20:06.221
Yup.

20:07.321 --> 20:08.555
Oh Christ.

20:09.323 --> 20:11.626
I'll be right there.

20:12.626 --> 20:13.895
Sorry, sweetheart,
I've gotta go.

20:14.729 --> 20:15.896
Work.

20:43.723 --> 20:47.159
- What's happened?
- Johnny Tramer, suicide.

20:47.161 --> 20:49.530
- Oh Jesus.
- Gunshot to the head.

20:53.233 --> 20:54.403
What's going on over there?

20:56.003 --> 20:57.405
It's a strange thing
really.

20:58.639 --> 20:59.807
Did he dig the hole?

21:00.107 --> 21:01.740
There was no sign
of a shovel around

21:01.742 --> 21:03.944
so if he did I'm not sure how.

21:04.578 --> 21:06.248
- His hands?
- I've checked.

21:06.748 --> 21:07.882
Fingernails are clean.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.319
- Strange.
- It gets even stranger.

21:11.551 --> 21:12.786
How do you mean?

21:13.053 --> 21:14.220
Check out the hand prints.

21:14.722 --> 21:17.089
Doesn't it look like someone
was buried alive here

21:17.091 --> 21:18.124
and dug their way out?

21:18.925 --> 21:20.960
Getting into the spirit
of Halloween, Brodie?

21:20.962 --> 21:22.563
No.

21:22.797 --> 21:25.400
It's just, just the way
it looks.

21:26.401 --> 21:28.803
It looks to me like somebody
just dug a hole in a field.

21:29.069 --> 21:30.438
Why I don't know.

21:31.839 --> 21:33.607
Looks like there was
some rain here, though.

21:34.009 --> 21:35.876
Big hands too so,
definitely a man.

21:36.610 --> 21:38.912
He cast his hands in the mud
there to boost himself out.

21:39.847 --> 21:42.714
So, Johnny got down
in the hole to continue digging

21:42.716 --> 21:44.450
then when he was done
he boosted himself out.

21:44.452 --> 21:46.154
See,
that's what I thought,

21:46.555 --> 21:48.823
but I got my guys to measure
the span of Johnny's hands

21:49.589 --> 21:51.425
and they're half the size
of those hand prints.

21:52.626 --> 21:54.596
So what are you saying,
someone else was here, too?

21:55.762 --> 21:59.067
Well, no sign of a shovel,
two sets of hand prints.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.402
Maybe someone killed him and
intended to bury the body

22:02.404 --> 22:04.638
but got disturbed and ran away.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.143
We'll have to see what the ballistics
report says. You call the coroner?

22:09.676 --> 22:12.179
Yeah, he's gonna have his work
cut out for him on this one.

22:13.414 --> 22:15.450
- How do you mean?
- Check out the body.

22:21.856 --> 22:24.159
Jesus. How long has he been
out here?

22:25.159 --> 22:27.192
Well I know he was
at work yesterday,

22:27.194 --> 22:29.364
so no longer than 24 hours.

22:30.498 --> 22:32.097
I've just never seen
a body decompose

22:32.099 --> 22:33.434
in such a short space of time.

22:41.309 --> 22:42.277
Frank?

22:44.646 --> 22:45.513
Frank.

22:46.181 --> 22:47.048
What?

22:48.249 --> 22:50.117
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

22:51.853 --> 22:54.222
I better go see Edie Tramer.
Christ.

22:54.822 --> 22:56.657
First her daughter last year
and now her son.

22:57.925 --> 23:00.462
- You gonna be okay here?
- Yeah, leave it to me.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.385
Hey there.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.186
Ellie.

23:25.986 --> 23:26.921
This looks great.

23:28.056 --> 23:29.755
You've all outdone
yourselves this year.

23:29.757 --> 23:30.759
Thanks.

23:32.492 --> 23:36.162
So, are you gonna help out or
are you just hanging 'round

23:36.164 --> 23:38.200
'til we bring out the punch bowl?

23:39.733 --> 23:40.734
Excuse me for a minute.

23:48.809 --> 23:49.877
How's it going, Joe?

23:50.544 --> 23:51.412
Not good.

23:51.812 --> 23:53.747
Johnny Tramer killed himself
last night.

23:55.482 --> 23:57.719
Oh Christ. What happened?

23:58.219 --> 24:00.555
He went to the place,
you know...

24:00.821 --> 24:02.289
where the package is.

24:03.089 --> 24:05.593
Anyway, the kid shot
himself in the head.

24:06.094 --> 24:06.962
He's dead.

24:08.261 --> 24:09.263
Good God.

24:09.963 --> 24:11.065
This is fucked up.

24:11.365 --> 24:13.532
If the police start
sniffin' around that area,

24:13.534 --> 24:15.535
they're gonna find more than
what they bargained for.

24:16.104 --> 24:17.403
- All right.
- Why'd that weak

24:17.405 --> 24:18.738
little fuck have
to do it there?

24:18.740 --> 24:21.175
Stay calm, I'll speak to Frank.
We'll sort it out.

24:31.418 --> 24:34.088
I know this is a heartbreaking
time for you, Edie...

24:35.589 --> 24:39.059
but is there anything
Johnny said or did...

24:40.561 --> 24:42.097
to indicate that
he was suicidal?

24:43.630 --> 24:45.766
He hasn't been the same
since Stephanie was murdered.

24:46.733 --> 24:47.801
None of us have.

24:49.436 --> 24:51.936
Did he say anything
about that whole business,

24:51.938 --> 24:53.607
you know, Jack Cain?

24:55.710 --> 24:56.978
I knew that he wanted him dead.

24:58.312 --> 24:59.179
We all do.

25:00.481 --> 25:02.850
Your men any closer
to finding that scumbag?

25:03.952 --> 25:06.186
Uh... not really.

25:07.489 --> 25:10.025
He left town last year.
He could've gone anywhere.

25:10.959 --> 25:12.293
Damn you for lettin' him go.

25:12.792 --> 25:15.664
I didn't let him go,
I made a mistake.

25:17.431 --> 25:18.966
I have to live with it
every day.

25:19.332 --> 25:21.535
Oh... poor you.

25:23.704 --> 25:26.040
I have to live with losing
Stephanie every day.

25:26.874 --> 25:28.343
And now my son, too.

25:29.844 --> 25:30.845
You're right.

25:31.445 --> 25:32.813
I didn't mean to be insensitive.

25:34.315 --> 25:35.881
I need to get back
to the station.

25:35.883 --> 25:38.017
Do you have someone coming over?

25:38.019 --> 25:39.951
I can send someone
to offer support.

25:39.953 --> 25:41.222
I just wanna be left alone.

25:43.758 --> 25:44.793
I understand.

25:46.260 --> 25:47.295
I'm sorry, Edie.

25:48.495 --> 25:49.396
Truly I am.

26:14.021 --> 26:15.857
- Hello?
- Hey, sweet cheeks.

26:16.590 --> 26:18.156
<i>You know,
the 50's called.</i>

26:18.158 --> 26:19.557
<i>He wants his pet name back.</i>

26:19.559 --> 26:21.229
I'm just tryin'
to be affectionate.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.264
I know, I'm only messing around.

26:23.998 --> 26:25.230
How's things going?

26:25.232 --> 26:27.067
Well, we found Johnny Tramer
this morning.

26:27.334 --> 26:28.236
He killed himself.

26:29.537 --> 26:30.972
Oh God, that's awful.

26:32.072 --> 26:34.775
His sister died last year, too.
His mother must be in bits.

26:35.242 --> 26:36.909
Yeah, your dad's
over there right now

26:36.911 --> 26:37.812
tellin' her the news.

26:39.414 --> 26:40.648
Oh God, that's awful.

26:42.383 --> 26:43.749
I didn't know them that well

26:43.751 --> 26:46.354
but Dad used to hang out
with their father years ago.

26:48.321 --> 26:50.256
Speakin' of your dad,
you didn't tell him

26:50.258 --> 26:51.857
about us did you?

26:51.859 --> 26:53.826
<i>Brodie, you are such a pussy,
do you know that?</i>

26:53.828 --> 26:55.562
- I'm not a pussy.
- You are.

26:57.231 --> 26:59.134
Why the hell are you
so scared of my dad?

27:00.367 --> 27:01.969
He's the sweetest guy
in the whole world.

27:02.270 --> 27:05.336
Yeah, at home maybe
but at work he's my boss

27:05.338 --> 27:07.839
and do you know how awkward it is to
get caught with the boss's daughter?

27:07.841 --> 27:09.275
Oh come on, admit it.

27:09.777 --> 27:11.711
The risk is all part
of the excitement.

27:13.580 --> 27:16.984
So, uh, tell me.
What are you wearing?

27:18.418 --> 27:20.453
A thick woolen
jumper and a hairnet.

27:20.988 --> 27:22.820
Aw, come on Jen, really?

27:22.822 --> 27:25.358
- You really wanna do this now?
- Yeah, just for a minute.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.060
Call it one of those
babe shows on the TV

27:28.062 --> 27:30.097
where the girls jiggle
their asses up and down.

27:30.496 --> 27:32.666
Yeah, those cost five
bucks a minute, this is free.

27:33.467 --> 27:35.703
You're such a cheeky shit,
do you know that?

27:38.106 --> 27:39.808
So go on, tell me.
What are you wearing?

27:41.008 --> 27:42.143
Who are you talking to?

27:43.743 --> 27:45.346
Uh, it's no one.

27:46.246 --> 27:47.281
<i>Talkin' to yourself?</i>

27:47.915 --> 27:49.451
<i>It's this girl I know.</i>

27:50.318 --> 27:51.618
<i>Okay, well don't be long.</i>

27:51.918 --> 27:54.288
We've got bigger things to be
concerning ourselves with today.

27:54.922 --> 27:55.924
I'll be in my office.

27:56.823 --> 27:57.758
Sir.

28:02.829 --> 28:04.698
- Hello?
- Pussy.

28:16.610 --> 28:17.976
- Oh my God.
- What?

28:17.978 --> 28:19.847
Right, right, check this out.

28:20.815 --> 28:23.217
- Fuck, what the hell is that?
- Runny funny.

28:23.850 --> 28:26.052
Real lack of standards,
your generation.

28:26.386 --> 28:28.521
Oh my God, we've got a squirter.

28:28.821 --> 28:30.992
All right, turn it off.
This is a place of business.

28:31.992 --> 28:32.859
All right.

28:33.226 --> 28:34.561
Steady on, granddad.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.560
You know when I was your age

28:36.562 --> 28:38.197
we didn't have access
to any of that.

28:38.866 --> 28:41.769
What we had was magazines.
We couldn't even afford 'em.

28:42.069 --> 28:43.969
But we'd always find, like,
big piles of them

28:43.971 --> 28:45.173
in the woods for some reason.

28:45.873 --> 28:48.309
That adds a whole new
meaning to the term naturist.

28:48.976 --> 28:50.310
So what's the fucking deal then?

28:50.543 --> 28:52.246
It's what lads do.

28:52.746 --> 28:53.813
Is it?

28:54.048 --> 28:55.682
Christ, I'm not missing much.

28:55.948 --> 28:57.683
Oh yeah, it's all about
the banter.

28:58.351 --> 29:00.655
I hear that word all the time,
banter.

29:01.388 --> 29:02.423
What does it even mean?

29:02.690 --> 29:04.525
Well it's just, you know,
needlin' each other.

29:04.892 --> 29:05.927
Havin' a laugh and that.

29:06.527 --> 29:08.994
And you banter all the time
with your little pals, do ya?

29:08.996 --> 29:10.297
Yeah, yeah we do.

29:11.366 --> 29:14.902
Although yeah, it can go
a bit too far sometimes.

29:15.202 --> 29:16.703
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

29:17.938 --> 29:20.705
Look, did I ever tell
ya about a lads' holiday

29:20.707 --> 29:22.441
me and a few mates
took to Mexico?

29:22.443 --> 29:23.444
No.

29:24.078 --> 29:24.945
Right.

29:25.946 --> 29:28.780
So there's this lad
called James, you know,

29:28.782 --> 29:31.952
and he's dead cocky,
overconfident, arrogant.

29:32.353 --> 29:35.554
So one night he goes out
and he gets shitfaced

29:35.556 --> 29:38.259
then he comes back to the villa
and he passes out on the sofa.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.461
So I have a thought, you know,

29:41.061 --> 29:42.596
I'm gonna take him down a peg.

29:43.097 --> 29:45.931
So what I do is I take
a condom and I put it

29:45.933 --> 29:48.069
on the end of a pencil and
then...

29:48.735 --> 29:51.305
...I pop it into his chocolate
whiz one while he's passed out.

29:52.740 --> 29:53.974
Chocolate whiz one.

29:54.575 --> 29:57.078
Yeah, your balloon knot.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.084
Your prison purse, your
chocolate starfish.

30:05.051 --> 30:06.119
Butthole.

30:06.386 --> 30:08.186
Then why don't you just say
that to begin with?

30:08.188 --> 30:10.722
All right, well I'll make sure
to keep my language

30:10.724 --> 30:12.458
more pensioner proof
in the future.

30:13.193 --> 30:15.728
Anyway, right, so James
wakes up the next day

30:15.730 --> 30:17.798
and he has no memory
of the night before.

30:18.198 --> 30:19.932
He was so shitfaced.

30:19.934 --> 30:21.933
All he knows he's
now got a condom

30:21.935 --> 30:23.370
hangin' out of his butthole.

30:23.805 --> 30:26.507
So he asks us,
"What happened last night?"

30:26.907 --> 30:28.007
And so we tell him.

30:28.809 --> 30:31.777
I say, "Well mate, we saw
you chattin' with this lad

30:31.779 --> 30:34.982
at the bar and next thing we
know you've left with him."

30:35.683 --> 30:38.584
So James, he starts freakin'
out 'cause he thinks

30:38.586 --> 30:41.189
he's been on the business end
of a stranger's pork sword.

30:43.323 --> 30:45.958
- Come on, pork sword means cock.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.859
The description kinda
tipped me off on that one.

30:47.861 --> 30:52.064
All right, all right. So James, he's
in tears and he calls his girlfriend,

30:52.066 --> 30:55.267
and he confesses to his
first gay experience

30:55.269 --> 30:57.135
and he catches the
next flight back home.

30:57.137 --> 31:00.974
And I didn't tell him the truth
until six months later.

31:04.244 --> 31:07.948
So technically the only one
that did anything gay was you.

31:09.517 --> 31:10.551
How do you figure that?

31:11.018 --> 31:14.122
- You stuck a pencil in his butt.
- Yeah, but that's not gay.

31:15.155 --> 31:17.625
- It's a bit gay.
- Well no, shut up.

31:18.459 --> 31:20.228
Yeah, you're right,
banter is fun.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.264
Anyway, I've got work to do.

31:24.365 --> 31:25.833
All right, be back in five.

31:26.700 --> 31:28.403
I'm going
for a wicked shit.

31:36.711 --> 31:39.213
So the kid, why'd he do it?

31:40.414 --> 31:41.846
Well considering where he did it

31:41.848 --> 31:43.684
I'm guessing he couldn't
live with what happened.

31:45.018 --> 31:47.689
- You speak to that mother of his?
- She's devastated.

31:48.821 --> 31:51.357
Did he tell her
what happened to Cain?

31:51.658 --> 31:53.261
I don't think she knows
anything.

31:55.495 --> 31:56.430
All right.

31:57.330 --> 31:59.166
Well, let me ask you, Frank.

31:59.966 --> 32:00.834
What about you?

32:02.301 --> 32:03.203
What about me?

32:03.703 --> 32:06.874
I don't see you at any
of these social nights anymore.

32:07.575 --> 32:09.676
It kinda feels like you're
avoiding us these days.

32:09.909 --> 32:12.376
Did you really think things
would stay the same between us?

32:12.378 --> 32:15.382
Shit like that changes people.
It certainly changed me.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.420
You overthink everything,
that's your problem.

32:19.753 --> 32:22.723
We did the right thing.
Justice was served.

32:23.757 --> 32:25.093
Whatever you say, Milton.

32:26.226 --> 32:27.492
Now if you don't mind,

32:27.494 --> 32:29.129
I've got a lot of
paperwork to get through.

32:55.455 --> 32:56.823
Mike, have you got
the wrench?

32:59.126 --> 33:00.127
Mike.

33:01.228 --> 33:02.497
Are you fuckin' deaf or what?

33:40.267 --> 33:41.335
What do you think?

33:45.638 --> 33:46.540
I don't know.

33:48.108 --> 33:50.310
I haven't seen anything like
this since the Cain murders.

33:52.613 --> 33:53.714
How do you wanna handle it?

33:57.284 --> 33:59.653
This is
a semi-automatic.

34:01.789 --> 34:04.122
Just cock back the hammer,
insert the cartridge

34:04.124 --> 34:07.960
into the chamber
and the pistol is ready

34:07.962 --> 34:08.896
for its next shot.

34:10.531 --> 34:12.966
Cartridges are fed
through a box magazine

34:13.266 --> 34:15.534
which are fed into the handle.

34:16.268 --> 34:18.101
If you want this
one I can give you

34:18.103 --> 34:20.371
five box magazines
that have 15 cartridges

34:20.373 --> 34:21.841
that come in double columns.

34:22.443 --> 34:24.879
It's a very, very
powerful machine.

34:25.513 --> 34:27.081
Quick and easy to
reload as well.

34:30.350 --> 34:33.954
This is your .38
snubnosed revolver.

34:35.255 --> 34:37.123
The cylinder holds seven loads.

34:37.725 --> 34:39.760
Both semi-autos and revolvers,

34:40.092 --> 34:41.963
they have two main
action styles.

34:43.097 --> 34:44.531
Single and double action.

34:45.831 --> 34:47.733
This little puppy,
she's a double.

34:48.702 --> 34:51.705
It's small, makin' it
perfect for concealment.

34:53.239 --> 34:55.074
But it still packs a
great fucking punch.

34:57.077 --> 34:58.279
Nifty fucking gun.

34:58.912 --> 35:01.848
Now this motherfucker,
this is me favorite.

35:05.318 --> 35:09.988
This fine weapon
enjoys the reputation

35:09.990 --> 35:12.292
of being the gold standard
of stopping power.

35:14.227 --> 35:18.397
It's an extremely
reliable one-shot stopper.

35:18.399 --> 35:22.033
It's not great for concealment,
but you can blow a hole

35:22.035 --> 35:24.271
through a fucking bear
with one of these things.

35:25.839 --> 35:27.238
Fucking love this gun.

35:29.743 --> 35:30.912
All right.

35:32.113 --> 35:33.181
Some little piggies...

35:34.481 --> 35:35.816
they like to go to the market.

35:36.216 --> 35:37.851
Some little piggies,
they stay home.

35:38.785 --> 35:41.656
Some like to eat lots
and lots of roast beef...

35:43.723 --> 35:45.124
but you, you little piggy

35:45.658 --> 35:47.459
you've come to buy
some dodgy guns.

35:47.461 --> 35:48.562
So which one you're havin'?

35:49.095 --> 35:50.630
Come on, I haven't
got all fucking day.

35:53.232 --> 35:54.202
All of them.

35:58.472 --> 36:00.441
You are a greedy little piggy,
aren't ya?

36:01.675 --> 36:04.142
I'm so sorry about Johnny.

36:04.144 --> 36:05.946
When I heard I had
to come see you.

36:06.881 --> 36:07.815
Thank you.

36:09.249 --> 36:11.084
Have you anyone here
that can support you?

36:12.385 --> 36:13.920
My brother's flying in tonight.

36:15.122 --> 36:16.290
He's all I've got left now.

36:19.126 --> 36:20.892
I know this is hard
for you, Edie,

36:20.894 --> 36:22.261
but I have to ask,

36:23.229 --> 36:25.665
did Johnny say anything
to you about Jack Cain?

36:26.399 --> 36:29.803
- Like where he disappeared?
- He didn't tell me anything.

36:31.405 --> 36:32.339
All right.

36:47.953 --> 36:51.024
I don't wish to be imposing but,
do you have any biscuits?

36:53.560 --> 36:54.595
Biscuits?

36:55.495 --> 36:56.363
Yeah.

36:57.464 --> 36:58.366
Uh...

36:59.133 --> 37:00.768
yeah, I think so.

37:01.669 --> 37:02.569
In the kitchen.

37:04.738 --> 37:07.038
- I'll go and get them.
- That would be lovely.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.743
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

39:08.193 --> 39:12.532
Will... you die, you fucking bitch?

39:15.401 --> 39:16.369
Die!

39:25.078 --> 39:26.046
Fuck.

39:29.149 --> 39:30.284
Where are the biscuits?

39:54.374 --> 39:56.176
Mate, let's
hear it for Halloween.

40:21.334 --> 40:22.368
Oh hello, darling.

40:22.968 --> 40:24.037
What are you doing?

40:24.638 --> 40:26.106
I'm just doing
all the decorations.

40:27.006 --> 40:28.675
But they should've been done
this morning.

40:29.709 --> 40:31.178
Oh, well I've...

40:31.979 --> 40:34.114
I've been really busy
with all the cakes as well.

40:34.580 --> 40:37.084
Some of them are a little
bit burnt, so, uh...

40:37.584 --> 40:38.719
What do you mean?

40:39.185 --> 40:40.888
Um, well, um...

40:42.055 --> 40:43.587
You haven't finished
the decorations,

40:43.589 --> 40:46.126
you've burnt the food.
What have you been doing?

40:46.794 --> 40:47.795
Redo them!

40:48.528 --> 40:49.996
- What, now?
- Yes, do it!

40:50.597 --> 40:51.765
Okay.

41:13.252 --> 41:14.821
Does it always have to be
like this?

41:15.689 --> 41:17.888
Look, I apologize for losing
my temper,

41:17.890 --> 41:19.158
but this has to be done.

41:21.961 --> 41:22.896
Okay.

41:49.957 --> 41:55.296
Only a pinpoint, a simple
amount in a glass of wine.

41:56.696 --> 41:58.132
Or perhaps a flower.

42:02.435 --> 42:03.837
<i>Keep it, monsieur.</i>

42:08.540 --> 42:09.577
<i>Keep it.</i>

42:11.278 --> 42:13.713
<i>You may change your mind.</i>

42:14.314 --> 42:16.383
<i>Not dead?</i>

42:16.783 --> 42:17.783
<i>Are you mad?</i>

42:18.118 --> 42:19.286
<i>I saw her die.</i>

42:19.818 --> 42:21.653
<i>The doctor signed
the certificate.</i>

42:21.655 --> 42:22.689
<i>I saw them bury her.</i>

42:24.191 --> 42:25.689
<i>Captive
in the borderline</i>

42:25.691 --> 42:27.694
<i>between life and death.</i>

42:29.028 --> 42:31.731
<i>Her brain drained
of the life spark.</i>

42:34.633 --> 42:39.171
<i>The white zombie obeys
the unholy commands</i>

42:39.173 --> 42:40.841
<i>of her demon master.</i>

42:51.184 --> 42:54.687
<i>As mindless creatures carry
out his curse at will...</i>

42:56.022 --> 42:58.723
<i>...terror explodes in horror</i>

42:58.725 --> 43:00.527
<i>...and heartache.</i>

43:00.928 --> 43:02.029
<i>Zombies!</i>

43:09.035 --> 43:14.273

44:58.111 --> 44:59.178
<i>Yeah?</i>

44:59.444 --> 45:01.080
Come to the Boggs' house
on Oak Street.

45:02.515 --> 45:03.684
It's bad, Frank.

45:04.484 --> 45:05.652
It's really fuckin' bad.

46:47.720 --> 46:51.591
Looks like we got
a maniac on the loose.

46:58.964 --> 47:00.033
You okay, Frank?

47:02.068 --> 47:03.135
- Frank?
- Hm?

47:04.970 --> 47:07.206
Yeah, yeah.

47:10.109 --> 47:11.410
I'm gonna tell you something

47:12.412 --> 47:14.147
that I've never told
another living soul.

47:14.781 --> 47:16.747
Yeah, something I've been
carrying around with me

47:16.749 --> 47:17.885
for a year now.

47:20.187 --> 47:21.054
Okay.

47:21.821 --> 47:22.689
Jack Cain.

47:24.823 --> 47:25.825
A year back,

47:26.760 --> 47:28.896
me, Boggs...

47:30.430 --> 47:31.498
Joe, and Johnny...

47:32.665 --> 47:33.867
we went to his cabin.

47:35.767 --> 47:37.236
We took him out to the field,

47:37.836 --> 47:39.939
the same one Johnny was
found at this morning...

47:42.142 --> 47:43.277
and we killed him.

47:44.977 --> 47:46.546
We shot him point blank...

47:48.013 --> 47:49.115
then we buried him.

47:51.149 --> 47:52.285
You serious, Frank?

47:53.185 --> 47:55.055
It felt like the right thing
to do.

47:56.656 --> 47:59.392
But it's haunted me ever since.

48:03.162 --> 48:04.063
Uh...

48:06.332 --> 48:09.399
So these murders,
there's now a clear link

48:09.401 --> 48:10.502
between the victims.

48:10.836 --> 48:11.838
Mm-hmm.

48:12.472 --> 48:14.908
Every man involved in the killing
of Jack Cain is now dead.

48:16.709 --> 48:17.910
All except one.

48:19.245 --> 48:20.847
You know what that
means, don't you?

48:22.883 --> 48:24.718
- You're next.
- That's right.

48:27.187 --> 48:28.855
There's something else
you should know, too.

48:29.522 --> 48:30.424
What's that?

48:32.191 --> 48:33.694
There's a guy...

48:35.160 --> 48:37.164
over in the penitentiary
in Edenfield,

48:37.564 --> 48:38.832
name of Charlie Edgar.

48:39.999 --> 48:42.336
He's serving life for the
murder of a young girl.

48:43.702 --> 48:45.336
A few months back
word got to me

48:45.338 --> 48:47.671
from the psychiatrist that Edgar

48:47.673 --> 48:49.442
had confessed
to the Cain murders.

48:50.075 --> 48:51.278
Did you interview him?

48:52.144 --> 48:53.179
I did, yeah.

48:54.814 --> 48:58.518
And I gotta tell ya, when
Edgar told me how it went down,

48:59.151 --> 49:00.052
I believed him.

49:01.254 --> 49:03.020
He knew a lot of details
about the murders

49:03.022 --> 49:04.457
that we kept out of the papers.

49:05.290 --> 49:06.392
So what did you do?

49:08.727 --> 49:09.829
I wrote a report.

49:12.765 --> 49:13.966
And then I buried it.

49:15.568 --> 49:17.002
Never showed it to anyone.

49:17.736 --> 49:20.138
It was hard enough
dealing with the idea

49:20.140 --> 49:21.674
of killing a guilty man.

49:22.107 --> 49:23.276
Jesus, Frank.

49:24.310 --> 49:25.912
I'm ashamed of what I've done.

49:28.914 --> 49:32.251
Does anyone else know...
that you killed Cain?

49:34.252 --> 49:36.120
It's possible one
of the other guys

49:36.122 --> 49:38.156
talked to someone, okay.

49:38.524 --> 49:41.392
But why would anyone
be taking revenge

49:41.394 --> 49:42.926
on behalf of Jack Cain?

49:42.928 --> 49:44.629
The whole town lived
in fear of him.

49:44.631 --> 49:45.798
They all wanted him dead.

49:46.399 --> 49:48.602
It could be a friend of Cain's,
someone linked to him.

49:48.935 --> 49:50.604
Yeah, that's
the rational explanation.

49:51.604 --> 49:52.806
But there's another theory.

49:54.240 --> 49:55.575
It's not quite so rational.

49:56.242 --> 49:57.243
And that is?

49:57.977 --> 49:59.613
Jack Cain is back from the dead.

50:00.713 --> 50:03.149
Look,
are you feelin' okay?

50:03.649 --> 50:06.151
You know, this is a stressful
time and everything, Frank.

50:06.153 --> 50:07.953
- You know, but...
- And that hole in the ground,

50:08.687 --> 50:11.892
you said it looked like someone had put their
hands down and boosted themselves out.

50:12.425 --> 50:13.359
Yeah.

50:14.359 --> 50:16.562
That's exactly where we buried
Cain.

50:17.662 --> 50:19.165
His body is missing.

50:20.365 --> 50:22.165
Maybe someone who
knows what went down

50:22.167 --> 50:24.503
stole it and wants you to think
he's back from the dead.

50:24.870 --> 50:26.937
There's just a lot of things
going on right now

50:26.939 --> 50:28.507
which can't be easily explained.

50:29.008 --> 50:30.544
We have to be open minded.

50:32.646 --> 50:33.879
So what's our next move?

50:35.881 --> 50:37.751
I've got an important
call back at the station.

50:38.685 --> 50:40.685
My daughter is over
at the town hall

50:40.687 --> 50:41.721
at the Halloween party.

50:42.787 --> 50:45.992
Go there and get her,
and bring her to the station.

50:47.593 --> 50:50.796
Okay, while we're
on that subject...

50:51.997 --> 50:54.464
since you told me the truth
I think it's only right

50:54.466 --> 50:56.836
that I tell you
the truth as well.

51:01.039 --> 51:01.974
What is it?

51:07.312 --> 51:08.247
Jennifer,

51:09.080 --> 51:10.249
we've been seeing each other.

51:11.484 --> 51:13.417
- How long for?
- Four months.

51:13.419 --> 51:15.053
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't say anything,

51:15.055 --> 51:16.888
it's just I didn't wanna say
too much

51:17.156 --> 51:19.559
before things developed, otherwise
things would've got awkward.

51:19.892 --> 51:21.727
- You serious about her?
- Very.

51:22.361 --> 51:25.631
I love her and... I think
she loves me, too.

51:38.343 --> 51:39.378
Take this

51:40.546 --> 51:43.116
for protection, and go
and get Jennifer...

51:44.816 --> 51:46.118
and bring her to the station.

51:46.718 --> 51:47.720
Got it.

52:04.271 --> 52:06.606
So we arranged to meet
at this bar at first,

52:07.606 --> 52:10.241
and he had like
seven gin and tonics

52:10.243 --> 52:11.945
in the space of an hour.

52:12.278 --> 52:13.711
The bartender tipped me off

52:13.713 --> 52:15.015
while the guy was
in the bathroom.

52:15.814 --> 52:18.316
I still ended up going
to another bar with him, though.

52:18.751 --> 52:21.521
He ordered guacamole
and refused to share it with me,

52:22.321 --> 52:23.622
while claiming he was gonna

52:23.888 --> 52:26.126
throw all the hipsters
into the street.

52:26.892 --> 52:28.261
Such a prick.

52:29.729 --> 52:32.131
In the end we went to this
all night coffee place,

52:32.499 --> 52:35.165
partly to sober him
up, and partly because

52:35.167 --> 52:37.401
I'd forgotten his name,
and I figured

52:37.403 --> 52:38.671
they'd write it on his cup.

52:40.006 --> 52:41.908
So I'm guessing there
was no second date, then.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.175
No.

52:43.877 --> 52:46.146
I think I'll give dating
a rest for a while.

52:47.713 --> 52:49.082
How's things with Brodie?

52:50.982 --> 52:52.318
I still haven't told my dad
yet.

52:52.718 --> 52:54.019
I'm not sure how he'll react.

52:55.153 --> 52:56.289
I'm sure he'll be fine.

52:57.055 --> 52:58.388
He wouldn't employ Brodie

52:58.390 --> 53:00.193
if he didn't think he was
a responsible guy.

53:01.493 --> 53:02.361
True.

53:04.430 --> 53:07.600
So, have you told Brodie
you're pregnant yet?

53:08.600 --> 53:09.468
What?

53:10.769 --> 53:11.903
How did you know?

53:12.604 --> 53:15.074
We're at a party
and you're drinking water.

53:15.341 --> 53:17.075
That is not the Jennifer I know.

53:17.475 --> 53:19.178
I only took the test today.

53:20.146 --> 53:21.247
Congratulations.

53:22.214 --> 53:23.750
- How do you feel?
- Just...

53:24.950 --> 53:26.151
nervous right now.

53:26.685 --> 53:28.185
I don't know if I'm ready.

53:28.187 --> 53:31.057
I have no idea how
Brodie will feel.

53:31.524 --> 53:33.059
It's a big step.

53:34.160 --> 53:36.229
Don't worry, he adores you.

53:36.928 --> 53:38.194
He'll be thrilled.

53:38.196 --> 53:39.865
It's going to be
a double whammy for my dad.

53:40.566 --> 53:43.066
Finding out I'm seeing
someone who works for him

53:43.068 --> 53:44.403
and he's going to be a grandpa?

53:45.772 --> 53:46.937
He's stressed enough.

53:46.939 --> 53:49.709
Hey, there's nothing
to worry about.

53:50.943 --> 53:53.345
Once the dust settles,
he'll be happy.

53:55.647 --> 53:57.615
I know how hard it
was for both of you

53:57.617 --> 53:58.917
when your mom passed.

54:00.720 --> 54:03.823
There's no other way to see
this than as a happy event.

54:05.790 --> 54:06.993
Thanks, Ellie.

54:12.298 --> 54:14.167
John, that phone number,

54:14.834 --> 54:16.935
the one that Cain called
when he was first arrested.

54:17.502 --> 54:18.805
You got an address from it yet?

54:22.040 --> 54:22.975
Mm-hmm.

54:25.745 --> 54:26.646
Yeah.

54:29.048 --> 54:30.082
Yeah.

54:32.885 --> 54:33.886
Thanks, John.

55:27.805 --> 55:28.841
Good evening.

55:30.810 --> 55:33.613
You know a man who carries a gun
doesn't strike me as secure.

55:34.414 --> 55:37.950
In fact, I see a frightened man
before me.

55:38.251 --> 55:39.486
Vincent Crowley?

55:40.185 --> 55:41.287
Who wants to know?

55:43.187 --> 55:44.057
My name's Hollister.

55:45.158 --> 55:46.392
I'm a police officer.

55:47.026 --> 55:48.595
I wanna talk to you
about Jack Cain.

55:50.595 --> 55:52.097
I'm always open to conversing.

55:53.164 --> 55:54.732
But I find it's
a lot more pleasant

55:54.734 --> 55:56.202
without a gun pointed at me.

56:06.345 --> 56:07.379
Sit down.

56:18.825 --> 56:21.093
What is it you'd like to know
about Jack Cain?

56:23.796 --> 56:24.864
When he was arrested,

56:25.497 --> 56:27.499
you were the first
person he called. Why?

56:29.167 --> 56:30.102
I'm his friend.

56:31.537 --> 56:32.504
Jack didn't have many.

56:39.010 --> 56:41.013
I see you shared an interest
in the occult.

56:43.048 --> 56:45.482
I take it the occult
as you call it

56:45.484 --> 56:47.754
is viewed upon
negatively in your world.

56:49.354 --> 56:50.656
If it's used to harm people.

56:53.626 --> 56:55.595
The occult is simply
a study of the unknown.

56:56.461 --> 56:58.997
It explores the boundaries
of our perceptions,

56:59.298 --> 57:01.401
our truths, our potentials.

57:02.200 --> 57:03.535
It's neither good nor evil.

57:06.205 --> 57:08.374
From what we found at his home,

57:09.274 --> 57:10.676
I know Jack Cain was using it.

57:12.678 --> 57:15.178
Jack was always interested
in exploring the boundaries

57:15.180 --> 57:16.883
between life and death.

57:17.517 --> 57:18.915
He entertained the possibility

57:18.917 --> 57:20.917
that the world
with which we are presented

57:20.919 --> 57:22.454
may not be all there is.

57:23.722 --> 57:24.624
Is that a crime?

57:25.289 --> 57:26.225
No.

57:27.026 --> 57:28.228
But murdering two people is.

57:32.131 --> 57:34.897
- You think murder's funny?
- No, Mr. Hollister.

57:34.899 --> 57:37.366
What I find amusing is how
a lie told for long enough

57:37.368 --> 57:39.472
can become the truth
in the minds of common men.

57:39.772 --> 57:40.807
You think he's innocent?

57:41.406 --> 57:43.809
On the night those children were
murdered, Jack was with me.

57:45.144 --> 57:46.977
We were welcoming
in the summer solstice

57:46.979 --> 57:49.348
down in Sacramento Bay
with a group of friends.

57:51.149 --> 57:53.216
We didn't return
home until after

57:53.218 --> 57:54.453
those bodies were discovered.

57:55.388 --> 57:57.156
You and these
friends you mention...

57:59.024 --> 58:00.760
why didn't you make
a statement in his defense?

58:01.627 --> 58:04.063
It wasn't necessary
as you know.

58:05.263 --> 58:07.098
But consider this,
Mr. Hollister.

58:07.100 --> 58:09.100
Would your system have
really taken the word

58:09.102 --> 58:10.403
of people such as us?

58:12.303 --> 58:14.572
We are the pariahs
of your society.

58:15.307 --> 58:17.741
We are the dogs you leave
on the side of the road.

58:17.743 --> 58:19.743
We don't fit into
your conventions,

58:19.745 --> 58:22.615
therefore we're
excluded and persecuted.

58:24.283 --> 58:26.184
Well I don't wanna get
into a debate over this.

58:27.586 --> 58:28.820
I just wanna know one thing.

58:29.622 --> 58:30.557
These...

58:31.857 --> 58:32.725
practices.

58:35.260 --> 58:36.627
Can they make a person capable

58:36.629 --> 58:39.499
of defying the laws of,
I don't know...

58:40.665 --> 58:41.633
physics?

58:42.667 --> 58:44.136
An intriguing question.

58:45.870 --> 58:47.504
It sounds like your mind is
opening up

58:47.506 --> 58:51.678
to the possibilities beyond
conventional earthbound thought.

58:53.211 --> 58:54.713
Just tell me what
Jack Cain believed.

58:56.147 --> 58:57.216
Help me understand.

58:58.117 --> 59:00.687
What is it you want
to understand, Mr. Hollister?

59:01.787 --> 59:04.656
What happened before
you killed him, or after?

59:08.160 --> 59:11.830
I'm no threat to you,
Mr. Hollister. Please, relax.

59:22.040 --> 59:24.810
The only thing a man is
afraid of is the truth.

59:26.412 --> 59:28.013
So if I'm to offer
you the truth,

59:29.182 --> 59:31.684
- are you ready to accept it?
- Yes.

59:36.821 --> 59:40.892
The Roman occupation of Britain lasted
between 43 A.D. and around 400.

59:42.361 --> 59:44.896
Before the Romans
invaded the Druid priesthood

59:45.164 --> 59:46.866
they were the undisputed
power in the land.

59:48.200 --> 59:50.303
The history is written
by the victors.

59:51.870 --> 59:53.370
When the Romans
conquered the Celts

59:53.372 --> 59:56.142
they gave unflattering
descriptions of the Druids.

59:57.508 --> 01:00:00.142
Some described them
as blood thirsty barbarians

01:00:00.144 --> 01:00:02.047
who offered up human sacrifices.

01:00:03.714 --> 01:00:07.519
Others maintain that the
Druids were gentle and peaceful

01:00:08.754 --> 01:00:12.625
and kept their authority through
being in touch with nature.

01:00:14.926 --> 01:00:17.229
The truth is
somewhere in between.

01:00:18.363 --> 01:00:21.064
You see the Druids did
make human sacrifices,

01:00:21.066 --> 01:00:22.901
but they were self-sacrifices.

01:00:25.236 --> 01:00:28.941
During Samhain,
especially the 31st,

01:00:30.176 --> 01:00:32.475
when the veil between
the living and the dead

01:00:32.477 --> 01:00:35.615
was at its thinnest,
some of the Druids

01:00:35.981 --> 01:00:38.483
sacrificed their lives
willingly.

01:00:40.084 --> 01:00:42.319
They believed that
their sacrificial blood

01:00:42.321 --> 01:00:45.089
seeping into the ground
could even have the power

01:00:45.091 --> 01:00:47.293
to... raise the dead.

01:00:51.229 --> 01:00:52.365
Did Jack Cain believe that?

01:00:54.966 --> 01:00:56.102
His mind was open.

01:00:56.836 --> 01:00:58.303
- Is yours?
- What do you mean?

01:01:00.772 --> 01:01:02.408
An injustice was committed.

01:01:03.075 --> 01:01:05.107
The town turned
against an innocent man

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:06.410
and he was executed,

01:01:06.979 --> 01:01:08.781
and now he's back for revenge.

01:01:09.247 --> 01:01:12.649
And with every soul he...
absorbs

01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:16.021
he becomes more
and more powerful.

01:01:17.423 --> 01:01:19.457
Of course there is another
explanation for all this.

01:01:19.825 --> 01:01:22.361
- Which is?
- You are the one that's back for revenge.

01:01:22.828 --> 01:01:25.430
Oh, Mr. Hollister.

01:01:26.464 --> 01:01:29.836
You came so close to a higher
form of understanding.

01:01:31.002 --> 01:01:32.370
But it frightened you...

01:01:33.305 --> 01:01:36.542
so you've returned to your
conventional earthbound perspective.

01:01:37.142 --> 01:01:40.377
In police work usually
the simplest explanation

01:01:40.379 --> 01:01:41.280
is the right one.

01:01:41.946 --> 01:01:43.849
So what now? Arrest me?

01:01:44.716 --> 01:01:46.218
It seems like the logical
next step.

01:01:47.051 --> 01:01:48.386
No, Mr. Hollister.

01:01:48.653 --> 01:01:50.687
The logical next step
would be to take a leaf

01:01:50.689 --> 01:01:53.223
out of the Druids' book
and make a self-sacrifice

01:01:53.225 --> 01:01:54.260
to save your town.

01:01:55.526 --> 01:01:57.695
Jack Cain is no longer human.

01:01:58.162 --> 01:01:59.865
He's becoming
more than human.

01:02:00.865 --> 01:02:03.834
He is your God now,
and he's a vengeful God

01:02:03.836 --> 01:02:06.171
seeking to punish those
who persecuted him.

01:02:07.006 --> 01:02:09.242
Only a self-sacrifice
will appease him.

01:02:47.546 --> 01:02:49.981
- He's the real McCoy.
- Yeah.

01:02:56.354 --> 01:02:57.455
Your baby daddy's here.

01:02:57.722 --> 01:02:59.791
Oh my God,
I hate that expression.

01:03:00.191 --> 01:03:03.227
Better get used to it.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:03:03.729 --> 01:03:05.231
I'll leave you guys to it.

01:03:08.667 --> 01:03:10.603
Can I talk to you in
private for a moment?

01:03:18.743 --> 01:03:19.778
What's wrong?

01:03:21.213 --> 01:03:23.948
- My dad okay?
- He's fine, well sort of.

01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:25.283
What do you mean?

01:03:25.618 --> 01:03:27.584
He's asked me to come
take you to the station.

01:03:27.586 --> 01:03:30.020
- Why?
- You know how I mentioned Johnny Tramer killed himself?

01:03:30.022 --> 01:03:31.657
- Yeah?
- We found four other bodies.

01:03:32.223 --> 01:03:33.191
- My God.
- Joe Johnson,

01:03:33.459 --> 01:03:35.424
Mike Anderson, Milton
Boggs and Veronica.

01:03:35.426 --> 01:03:37.762
- What happened?
- All murdered.

01:03:38.664 --> 01:03:40.631
Oh my God. Have you found out
who did it?

01:03:40.633 --> 01:03:41.832
No, not yet.

01:03:41.834 --> 01:03:43.535
We got our guys out
patrolling the streets.

01:03:44.135 --> 01:03:45.769
Your dad's asked
me to come get you.

01:03:45.771 --> 01:03:47.270
Shouldn't we stay here?

01:03:47.272 --> 01:03:48.674
I mean, there's lots
of people around.

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:52.310
Whoever killed those people
isn't going to come here.

01:06:11.383 --> 01:06:13.750
The music cost four bucks!

01:06:13.752 --> 01:06:15.352
What's
the matter with you?

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:18.924
Trick or treat.

01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:39.808
Go that way,
go that way.

01:06:45.117 --> 01:06:46.151
Get away from him!

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:55.394
No, please, no.
What the fuck are you?

01:07:22.754 --> 01:07:23.989
Get away from him!

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.675
Oy, you!

01:07:47.845 --> 01:07:49.180
Come and have a piece of this.

01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:52.384
Come on.

01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:25.950
- No, don't.
- It's okay.

01:08:44.035 --> 01:08:45.104
There's no pulse.

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:50.475
He's not breathing.

01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:01.653
Help!

01:09:14.466 --> 01:09:15.466
Come here.

01:09:15.966 --> 01:09:16.935
What's happening?

01:09:17.336 --> 01:09:18.970
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:21.439
Brodie.

01:09:23.774 --> 01:09:24.776
Hey.

01:09:25.577 --> 01:09:28.680
I made a terrible mistake,
but I'm gonna make up for it.

01:09:31.881 --> 01:09:33.417
Oh my God.

01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:35.421
I thought you were dead.

01:09:36.321 --> 01:09:37.256
It's okay.

01:09:38.790 --> 01:09:40.292
No, not I'm not worried.

01:09:41.493 --> 01:09:42.493
Brodie.

01:09:43.796 --> 01:09:45.629
Take my daughter
and get outta here.

01:09:45.631 --> 01:09:46.865
What are you gonna do?

01:09:48.566 --> 01:09:49.901
Just take care of her.

01:09:56.675 --> 01:09:57.642
I will.

01:10:03.848 --> 01:10:05.550
No, Dad,
you're coming with us.

01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:08.220
I don't have time to argue.
Just go.

01:10:09.186 --> 01:10:11.589
Dad, I'm not leaving
here without you.

01:10:18.462 --> 01:10:19.597
Okay.

01:10:20.464 --> 01:10:21.533
Go.

01:10:37.481 --> 01:10:40.684
No, Dad! What are you doing?

01:10:40.686 --> 01:10:42.921
Dad! Dad!

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.390
Dad!

01:10:56.534 --> 01:10:59.937
Time to pay
for what you did, Hollister.

01:11:02.673 --> 01:11:04.776
For the first time you
and I are in agreement.

01:11:06.244 --> 01:11:07.479
This ends right here and now.

01:11:15.454 --> 01:11:17.489
Perhaps you and I
will find redemption.

01:11:18.757 --> 01:11:20.559
Then we'll see each
other in heaven.

01:11:23.762 --> 01:11:24.897
Who am I kidding?

01:11:28.934 --> 01:11:30.135
I'll see you in hell.

01:12:04.334 --> 01:12:07.068
<i>October
31st is normally the time</i>

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:08.338
<i>for a safe scare.</i>

01:12:08.839 --> 01:12:10.676
<i>The time when kids go
trick-or-treating</i>

01:12:10.943 --> 01:12:12.476
<i>and adults watch horror films,</i>

01:12:12.944 --> 01:12:17.449
<i>but last night Dunwich residents
experienced a real-life horror</i>

01:12:17.681 --> 01:12:20.519
<i>as a Halloween party
descended into a nightmare.</i>

01:12:21.653 --> 01:12:24.122
<i>The town hall was
engulfed in flames</i>

01:12:24.422 --> 01:12:27.191
<i>and a dozen people are
believed to have died.</i>

01:12:27.458 --> 01:12:29.759
<i>Several people are
critically injured</i>

01:12:29.761 --> 01:12:32.327
<i>and the death toll
is expected to rise.</i>

01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:35.965
<i>The local fire department
have not yet confirmed</i>

01:12:35.967 --> 01:12:38.501
<i>the cause of the blaze,
but several witnesses</i>

01:12:38.503 --> 01:12:41.004
<i>have claimed that
prior to the explosion</i>

01:12:41.271 --> 01:12:44.840
<i>an unidentified masked
man ran into the building</i>

01:12:44.842 --> 01:12:48.445
<i>with a weapon, wounding
