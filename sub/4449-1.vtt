DIDN'T SEEM LIKE YOU WERE
IN A HAPPY PLACE.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.050
- [chuckles]

18:38.084 --> 18:40.086
MAYBE WE SHOULD SLEEP SEPARATE.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.721
- I DIDN'T SAY
WE SHOULD SLEEP APART.

18:41.754 --> 18:44.957
I SAID IT DIDN'T SEEM
LIKE YOU WERE IN A HAPPY PLACE.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.929
- THIS IS MY HAPPY PLACE.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.297
- BETTER.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.104
[knock at door]

18:58.137 --> 19:01.574
- CHARLIE?

19:01.607 --> 19:02.675
- SECRET'S OUT.

19:02.708 --> 19:03.676
- WHAT?

19:03.709 --> 19:05.077
- YOU WEREN'T IN YOUR ROOM.

19:05.111 --> 19:08.514
- THAT'S BECAUSE
SHE'S IN MY ROOM.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.917
- YOU WERE THE LAST ONE
TO DRIVE THE VAN.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.084
- DO YOU NEED THE KEYS?

19:12.118 --> 19:14.554
- YEAH, I GOT TO GO
DROP OFF SOME BARRELS.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.755
THANKS, BABE.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.924
- DUTY CALLS.

19:20.026 --> 19:20.993
COME HERE.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.196
- GO.
[both laugh]

19:23.229 --> 19:24.564
GET OUT OF HERE.

19:24.564 --> 19:27.233
- FRIED THEM JUST THE WAY
YOU LIKE THEM.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.668
- AWESOME.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.203
OH, HEY, WILL YOU ACTUALLY
PUT IT ON PAPER?

19:30.203 --> 19:32.138
I GOT TO GET GOING.
- [speaking Spanish]

19:32.171 --> 19:34.073
COMING UP.
- JOHNNY.

19:34.073 --> 19:35.675
- WHAT?
I'M RIGHT HERE.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.743
- WHERE ARE ALL THE TO-GO MUGS?

19:37.777 --> 19:39.712
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.847
WHY DO YOU GOT TO
AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME IT'S ME?

19:41.881 --> 19:43.616
I'M VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT THAT.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.218
YOU.
- YEAH.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.519
- ALL RIGHT.
- YEP.

19:46.552 --> 19:47.887
- SO IF I WENT UP
TO YOUR ROOM RIGHT NOW,

19:47.920 --> 19:49.822
I WOULDN'T FIND
ALL OF OUR MUGS?

19:49.822 --> 19:51.657
- NOT IF I GET UP THERE FIRST.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.292
- [chuckles]

19:53.526 --> 19:56.195
- MORNING.
- MORNING.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.130
- EGGS, WARREN?
- PLEASE.

19:58.164 --> 20:01.133
- HEY, YO, WHY DO YOU THINK
JAKES WOULD GET A CREDIT REPORT?

20:01.167 --> 20:03.869
- NONE OF YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS
IS WHY, MAN.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.839
- ANYTHING IN HERE OF YOURS
I SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.608
IS HE STILL DOING
THE WHOLE LABELING THING?

20:08.641 --> 20:09.976
- NOT FOR A WHILE.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.577
- HEY, WHY DID YOU STOP
LABELING EVERYTHING, BRO?

20:11.577 --> 20:12.778
- MAYBE I GREW UP.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.014
- OR MAYBE BRIGGS
STOPPED STEALING YOUR SH--.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.249
- NOT LIKELY.
- ALL GASSED UP.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.117
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.118
- YOU GOT IT.

20:19.118 --> 20:21.254
- HEY, MIKE.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.789
GOOD LUCK TODAY.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.859
- YEAH, MIKE, GOOD LUCK.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.027
- THANKS, GUYS.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.529
- [sighs]
MIKEY, DON'T GET SHOT.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.531
- DO NOT GET SHOT, MIKE.
- PLEASE DON'T GET SHOT.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.666
- YO, I'M OUT TOO, Y'ALL.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.235
I GOT TO GO SEE A GUY
ABOUT A THING.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.937
- BUYING A NEW CAR?
- NOPE.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.772
- WHAT KIND YOU THINKING ABOUT?
- I'M NOT BUYING A CAR, JOHNNY.

20:39.805 --> 20:41.674
- I'LL GO WITH YOU.
I'LL TEST-DRIVE IT WITH YOU.

20:41.707 --> 20:43.776
- LEAVE ME ALONE.
SEE YA.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.178
- YOU KNOW,
TODAY SHOULD GO WELL.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.881
WE STAGE AT 9:00,
MEET LEON AT 10:00,

20:48.914 --> 20:50.149
BAD GUYS GO TO JAIL AT 11:00.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.851
WE SHOULD BE RIDING THE WAVES
BY NOON.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.886
- GOT TO RESPECT
THAT CONFIDENCE.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.755
- [chuckles] YEAH, LEON THINKS
I'M BRINGING YOU

20:55.755 --> 20:57.590
FOR A LITTLE MEET AND GREET
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A CRATE

20:57.623 --> 20:59.025
OF AT4 ROCKET LAUNCHERS
TO SELL.

20:59.058 --> 21:01.594
- DAMN. I MUST HAVE
SOME SERIOUS CONTACTS.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.529
- YEAH, WELL, NOTHING
BUT THE BEST, AGENT WARREN,

21:03.562 --> 21:05.564
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE
MAKING IT UP AS YOU GO ALONG.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.600
NOW, IN REALITY,
LEON NEEDS TO VISUALLY CONFIRM

21:07.600 --> 21:10.536
THAT YOU ARE INDEED
MIKE THE MARINE, OKAY?

21:10.569 --> 21:12.838
FORMERLY IN THE EMPLOY
OF OUR FRIEND BELLO.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.573
AND ONCE HE'S SATISFIED
THAT YOU'RE YOU,

21:14.607 --> 21:17.176
HE'LL CALL IN THE CAZA CAVALRY.
- BUT BEFORE THEY CAN KILL ME...

21:17.209 --> 21:18.944
- WE'LL ARREST THEM
AND START FLIPPING THEM, BABY.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.980
- SURFING BY NOON.
- [clicks tongue]

21:21.013 --> 21:23.516
- THAT'S SOME PROFESSIONAL-GRADE
STUFF, CHUCK.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.884
- THANKS, MIKEY.
- YEAH, IT BETTER BE.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.919
SHE'S UNDERCOVER
AT A TATTOO PARLOR.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.587
- LITTLE INK SPOT IN EAST L.A.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.956
- [chuckles] YEAH, WHERE GUYS
COME IN TO GET TEARDROP TATTOOS.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.525
- NO SH--.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.994
- YEAH, THEY OPEN UP
AND CONFESS ALL SORTS OF CRAP.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.596
THEY LITERALLY HAVE ME
TATTOOING THEIR MURDERS

21:37.630 --> 21:39.932
ON THEIR FACE.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.200
ALL RIGHT, ALL GOOD.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.702
- YEAH, A THING
OF BEAUTY, CHUCK.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.637
I'LL JUST GO CHECK IN
WITH JOHNNY AND HIS TEAM,

21:44.670 --> 21:45.738
AND WE'LL BE ON OUR MERRY WAY.

21:45.771 --> 21:47.039
- OKAY.
- COOL.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.084
- SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

21:58.117 --> 22:00.086
- YEAH.
HOW'S HE DOING?

22:00.119 --> 22:01.087
- PAUL?
- YEAH.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.788
- HE'S GOOD, REAL GOOD.

22:02.788 --> 22:04.256
- GOOD.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.257
GOOD.
I JUST--

22:05.291 --> 22:06.726
YOU KNOW, I FIND MYSELF
SOMETIMES

22:06.759 --> 22:08.928
THINKING ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED--

22:08.961 --> 22:11.163
YOU KNOW, JUAN'S DEATH.

22:11.197 --> 22:14.600
YOU AND I BOTH THOUGHT
HE WAS ODIN.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.675
YOU GUYS
ARE SLEEPING TOGETHER?

22:22.708 --> 22:25.544
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
THOSE ARE MINE?

22:25.578 --> 22:28.547
- NO CIVILIANS UPSTAIRS,
AND I KNOW THEY'RE NOT PAIGE'S.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.983
- CAST THE FIRST STONE,
LOVER BOY.

22:32.618 --> 22:34.887
- NO, WE NEV--

22:38.924 --> 22:41.727
SO YOU THINK HE'S CLEAN?

22:41.761 --> 22:43.028
- HE'S IN A REALLY GOOD PLACE.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.897
HE DIDN'T DESERVE THE STUFF
WE PUT HIM THROUGH.

22:44.930 --> 22:47.533
DON'T GO DREDGING THIS STUFF
UP AGAIN, MIKE.

22:47.566 --> 22:48.534
- OKAY.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.736
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.571
I JUST WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

22:52.605 --> 22:55.007
- YOU ALREADY KNOW.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.220
- WE GOT BRIGGS AND WARREN
WIRED UP.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.589
AS SOON AS WE SEE
THESE CAZA PRICKS, WE MOVE IN.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.224
THE POINT IS TO TALK
TO THESE GUYS.

23:12.258 --> 23:13.859
SO IF THINGS HEAD SOUTH,
PUT THEM DOWN,

23:13.893 --> 23:14.994
BUT KEEP THEM BREATHING.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.596
- SO ANY NERVES
ABOUT GOING UNDERCOVER AGAIN?

23:17.630 --> 23:19.265
- NOPE.
MORE EXCITED THAN ANYTHING.

23:19.265 --> 23:20.733
- YEAH.

23:20.766 --> 23:22.968
- YOU AND CHARLIE, HUH?

23:23.002 --> 23:25.037
- YOU FISHING, WARREN?
- NO, SIR.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.038
PANTIES ON YOUR FLOOR.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.807
- OH.
- [chuckles]

23:27.840 --> 23:30.509
IS THAT SMART?

23:30.543 --> 23:32.978
- I GUESS WE BOTH NEEDED
SOMEBODY TO LEAN ON, YOU KNOW?

23:34.814 --> 23:35.881
[tires screech]

23:35.881 --> 23:36.882
HA.

23:36.882 --> 23:38.717
THERE HE IS.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.052
AH, WHAT'S UP, LEON?

23:40.085 --> 23:42.888
- PAULY.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.123
IS THAT HIM?
- YEAH, MAN.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.624
EASY MONEY,
JUST LIKE I SAID, BRO.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.860
HEY, MIKE, I WANT YOU TO MEET
MY, UH, GOOD FRIEND LEON.

23:47.893 --> 23:49.028
- NICE TO MEET YOU, LEON.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.296
- LIKEWISE, MIKE.
LIKEWISE.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.031
LET'S SEE
THAT MERCHANDISE, HUH?

23:56.735 --> 23:57.870
- IS THAT HIM?

23:57.870 --> 24:00.739
- YEAH.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.141
- YOU GONNA CALL CAZA OR WHAT?

24:02.141 --> 24:03.509
- HUH?
OH, YEAH.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.744
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

24:08.781 --> 24:12.251
- [scoffs] LEON, WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BRO?

24:12.284 --> 24:13.252
- WE GOT A GUN.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.887
- I SEE IT.
NO SHOT. NO SHOT.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.755
- CHANGE OF PLANS, PAUL,
ALL RIGHT?

24:16.789 --> 24:18.958
WE'RE NOT SPLITTING THE MONEY.
- WHAT DID YOU DO? WHERE'S CAZA?

24:18.991 --> 24:20.960
- HEY, I'M MAKING THIS
EASY ON YOU, BRO.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.562
- YOU'RE MAKING THIS EASY ON ME
BY PUTTING A GUN IN MY FACE?

24:23.596 --> 24:25.965
THAT DON'T FEEL EASY.
- I WILL HURT YOU, PAUL.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.233
ALL RIGHT?

24:27.266 --> 24:28.801
- YOU'LL HURT ME?
- I WILL HURT YOU BAD.

24:28.834 --> 24:30.803
- DAMN IT, BRIGGS,
YOU'RE IN MY LINE, MAN.

24:30.836 --> 24:33.038
- I'M TELLING YOU, LEON, YOU
REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

24:33.038 --> 24:34.773
- DON'T YOU TELL ME
WHAT I WANT TO DO, OKAY?

24:34.807 --> 24:35.908
HEY. HEY.
- MIKE, BE COOL.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.177
- I'VE GOT HIM.
I'M TAKING THE SHOT.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.513
BRIGGS BLOCKED ME INTENTIONALLY
THIS TIME.

24:40.513 --> 24:41.647
ANYONE ELSE GOT A SHOT?

24:41.647 --> 24:42.681
- NO SHOT.

24:42.715 --> 24:43.782
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

24:43.816 --> 24:45.784
- JUST A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT
BETWEEN FRIENDS.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.520
- I'LL SHOOT YOU BOTH,
I SWEAR TO GOD.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.755
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY.
I WILL BRING THEM A CORPSE.

24:49.788 --> 24:50.890
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW IT.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.791
JOHNNY,
SHOOT HIM IN THE HAND.

24:52.791 --> 24:54.793
- [grunts]

24:54.793 --> 24:57.696
[groaning]

25:02.968 --> 25:04.570
HOW DID YOU DO THAT, PAUL?

25:04.603 --> 25:06.005
- GEE, I DON'T KNOW, LEON.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.574
MAYBE BECAUSE I'M A FED.
- [groans]

25:08.607 --> 25:09.808
- YOU DUMBASS,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

25:09.808 --> 25:10.809
- BRIGGS.
- YEAH.

25:10.809 --> 25:13.178
- WE STILL GONNA BE
SURFING BY NOON?

25:13.212 --> 25:16.081
- PROBABLY NOT.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.819
- NO, YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.
- SHUT UP.

25:20.819 --> 25:22.955
- OH, MAN,
YOU GUYS ARE HEARTLESS, MAN...

25:22.988 --> 25:23.956
HEARTLESS.

25:23.989 --> 25:25.224
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.092
- LEON, YOU JUST TRIED
TO CUT ME OUT OF THIS DEAL.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.261
- AND YOU WERE ABOUT TO HAND ME
OVER TO SOME ASSASSINS.

25:29.295 --> 25:32.231
- HEY, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO
KNOW THEY WERE ASSASSINS, HUH?

25:32.231 --> 25:34.099
- MM-HMM.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.069
HOW DO WE REACH THEM?

25:37.069 --> 25:38.571
- NUMBER'S UNDER...

25:38.604 --> 25:40.940
[clears throat]
"KILLBOYS."

25:40.973 --> 25:44.176
- [chuckles]

25:44.209 --> 25:46.178
- YES, IT IS.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.249
[cell phone beeps,
line trilling]

25:50.249 --> 25:52.284
- YO, WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

25:52.518 --> 25:53.719
- GOT A LITTLE CHANGE IN PLANS.

25:53.752 --> 25:55.254
YOUR BOY LEON HERE
JUST TRIED TO CUT ME OUT,

25:55.287 --> 25:57.623
SO NOW YOU'RE DEALING WITH ME.
- WHO ARE YOU?

25:57.656 --> 25:59.992
- WHO AM I?
I'M THE GUY WHO HAS THE GUY.

26:00.025 --> 26:02.061
YOU WANT YOUR MARINE,
COME TO ME.

26:02.094 --> 26:04.263
- NAH.
KEEP THIS PHONE.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.764
WE'LL TELL YOU
WHEN AND WHERE.

26:05.798 --> 26:06.765
[line clicks, dial tone]

26:06.799 --> 26:08.267
- [sighs]

26:08.300 --> 26:10.703
- WHAT WAS THAT?

26:10.703 --> 26:11.870
- THANKS A LOT, LEON.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.111
I'M CALLING IT OFF.
- GUYS, NOTHING'S CHANGED.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.013
WE STILL GRAB THEM,
AND WE ROLL THEM UP.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.881
- IF WE DON'T CONTROL
THE TIME OR PLACE OF THE MEET,

26:22.881 --> 26:24.617
I CAN'T GUARANTEE
YOUR SAFETY, MIKE.

26:24.617 --> 26:26.118
- MY SAFETY?
- YEAH.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.020
- SINCE WHEN ARE YOU CONCERNED
ABOUT MY SAFETY?

26:28.020 --> 26:29.755
USED TO BE YOU'D MARCH ME
TO THE GATES OF HELL

26:29.755 --> 26:31.023
IF IT MEANT A SHOT
AT THE CAZA CARTEL.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.558
- LOOK, LET IT GO, MAN.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.892
IF BRIGGS SAYS THE MISSION
IS OVER, IT'S OVER--COME ON.

26:33.892 --> 26:35.227
- YOU NEED TO START
THINKING FOR YOURSELF, JOHN.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.096
- I'M--I'M SORRY,
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO ME?

26:37.129 --> 26:39.632
- WOW. YOU'RE REALLY ON ONE
TODAY, AREN'T YOU, WARREN?

26:39.632 --> 26:41.033
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU GUYS?

26:41.033 --> 26:43.102
THE BRIGGS THAT I KNEW--

26:43.135 --> 26:45.037
HE COULD SEE THINGS
FROM 3,000 FEET.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.905
NOW IT'S LIKE--

26:46.939 --> 26:48.607
IT'S LIKE YOU GUYS
ARE A BUNCH OF BEACH BURNOUTS

26:48.641 --> 26:50.976
PLAYING COPS AND ROBBERS.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.211
[both chuckle]

26:52.244 --> 26:53.879
- BURNOUTS?
OKAY.

26:53.912 --> 26:55.147
- CAN WE GET TO WORK?

26:55.180 --> 26:57.750
OR SHOULD WE GO
SPIN AROUND THE SHOTGUN?

26:57.750 --> 26:59.151
THAT LOOKED FUN.

26:59.184 --> 27:02.021
- CAN I HIT HIM?
- NO, JOHNNY, YOU CAN'T.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.056
I'M CALLING
THE OPERATION, MIKE.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.591
IT'S OFF.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.893
I'M SORRY YOU WASTED
A FIRST-CLASS TICKET OUT HERE.

27:07.926 --> 27:11.063
HOPE YOU DIDN'T WRINKLE
YOUR SUIT.

27:11.096 --> 27:14.566
- YOU KNOW WE WERE DOING FINE
WITHOUT YOU, RIGHT, BRO?

27:29.815 --> 27:33.652
- HEY.
- HEY.

27:33.652 --> 27:36.722
- WHAT'S UP?

27:36.755 --> 27:40.659
- SO D.C. KIND OF TURNED YOU
INTO AN ASSHOLE, HUH?

27:40.659 --> 27:41.694
- NOW I'M AN ASSHOLE.

27:41.727 --> 27:43.929
- MM, JUST LIKE WE'RE BURNOUTS.

27:43.929 --> 27:46.098
- I DIDN'T MEAN YOU.

27:46.098 --> 27:47.199
- JOHNNY WASN'T THE ONLY ONE

27:47.232 --> 27:49.034
SPINNING AROUND
THE SHOTGUN, MIKE.

27:49.068 --> 27:52.204
- [chuckles]

27:52.204 --> 27:55.507
LOOK, WHEN I GOT TO D.C.,

27:55.541 --> 27:57.176
I WAS...
[sighs]

27:57.209 --> 27:58.677
I MEAN, I WAS A ROCK STAR.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.979
I WAS A REAL UNDERCOVER AGENT,
YOU KNOW?

28:01.013 --> 28:04.850
EVERYONE WAS EXCITED, AND...

28:04.883 --> 28:08.053
THEY WERE SO EXCITED,
THEY STUCK ME BEHIND A DESK.

28:08.087 --> 28:11.123
- ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU WANTED?

28:11.156 --> 28:13.158
- MAYBE.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.563
BUT AFTER YOU DO
WHAT WE DO...

28:17.563 --> 28:19.965
- NOTHING ELSE
FEELS LIKE REAL LIFE.

28:22.267 --> 28:23.702
I KNOW.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.675
- I HAD THIS THEORY, RIGHT?

28:29.708 --> 28:31.110
THIS BUS THEORY.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.645
AND I BASICALLY MADE THEM--

28:33.679 --> 28:35.114
FORCED THEM TO LET ME
PURSUE IT.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.282
AND I JUST BURNED RIGHT THROUGH

28:37.516 --> 28:39.218
ALL THE CLOUT
THAT I HAD GOING IN.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.886
- AH, SO YOU'RE BACK HERE

28:40.919 --> 28:45.124
TO TRY TO MAKE YOURSELF
A ROCK STAR AGAIN.

28:45.157 --> 28:48.994
[laughs]

28:49.027 --> 28:52.865
THIS WORLD HAS
ENOUGH DEAD ROCK STARS, MIKE.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.768
BRIGGS IS JUST TRYING TO MAKE
SURE YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.709

30:10.108 --> 30:12.811
- [sighs]
HEY, DARLING.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.646
IT'S LATE.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.716

30:17.749 --> 30:19.051
- ANOTHER LONG WALK, HUH?

30:19.051 --> 30:21.687
- LIKE YOU'VE NEVER NEEDED

30:23.789 --> 30:25.724

30:25.757 --> 30:28.894
YOU SAID YOU WERE QUITTING.
- I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

30:28.927 --> 30:30.662
[knock at door]

30:30.696 --> 30:32.064
- CAN WE TALK?

30:39.805 --> 30:41.807
- WHAT'S UP?

30:43.809 --> 30:44.943
- I HAVE A D.C. SECTION CHIEF

30:44.943 --> 30:47.045
THAT'S GIVEN ME CONTROL
OVER THIS CAZA OP.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.547
DOING IT
WITH OR WITHOUT YOU.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.082
- LOOK AT YOU.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.884
PULLING RANK, HUH?

30:51.917 --> 30:53.952
NICE.
GUESS THAT'S THAT.

30:53.952 --> 30:56.154
- I'D PREFER
IF IT WAS WITH YOU.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.823
- YES, SIR, AGENT WARREN.

30:57.856 --> 31:02.094
YOUR PREFERENCE WILL CERTAINLY
BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.

31:16.909 --> 31:18.977
- JUST GOT A CALL FROM CAZA.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.679
- WHAT'D THEY SAY?

31:20.712 --> 31:23.048
- THEY GAVE US
A PLACE AND TIME.

31:23.081 --> 31:25.183
- YOU'RE IN?
- YEAH...

31:25.217 --> 31:28.954
AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT.

31:31.990 --> 31:35.928
[horn honks]
[sirens wailing]

31:42.567 --> 31:43.902
- IT'S A LITTLE
ON THE SMALL SIDE,

31:43.936 --> 31:46.538
BUT I THINK
I COULD MAKE IT WORK.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.711
- IT'S JUST THE TWO OF YOU?

31:52.744 --> 31:56.014
- YEAH, ME AND MY SON.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.754
- ALL RIGHT,

32:02.754 --> 32:04.256
SO WE GOT TRANSPONDERS
ON BOTH YOUR PHONES,

32:04.289 --> 32:05.991
SO WE CAN TRACK YOU
IN CASE ANYTHING GOES WRONG.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.160
- NOTHING'S GONNA GO WRONG,
IS IT, JOHNNY?

32:08.193 --> 32:10.062
- I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW,
US LIQUORED-UP BURNOUTS

32:10.095 --> 32:11.897
CAN'T DO NOTHING RIGHT.
- [chuckles]

32:11.930 --> 32:14.599
- I DIDN'T CALL YOU GUYS DRUNKS.
- DICK, BRO.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.268

A PART OF THIS, PAUL.

32:16.501 --> 32:17.736

WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD STOP

32:17.769 --> 32:18.870
BREAKING THE LAW, THEN, LEON.

32:18.904 --> 32:20.539
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
THIS LITTLE PROBLEM.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.240
HAVE A SEAT.
- OW.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.176
- NOW, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S SEEN OUR CAZA BOYS,

32:24.209 --> 32:25.744
SO DON'T BE SHY.

32:25.744 --> 32:29.681

32:36.688 --> 32:39.758
[sighs]

32:39.791 --> 32:40.926
THESE GUYS ARE LATE.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.794
- I EXPECT A CERTAIN LEVEL
OF PROFESSIONALISM

32:42.828 --> 32:45.797
FROM MY PROFESSIONAL ASSASSINS.
- MM-HMM.

32:45.831 --> 32:48.133
THIS IS SLOPPY.
I DON'T LIKE IT.

32:48.166 --> 32:50.902
[dogs barking frantically]

32:50.902 --> 32:54.639
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THOSE DOGS?

32:55.907 --> 32:58.076

33:00.045 --> 33:02.581

38:27.739 --> 38:30.108
WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU, MAN?
- IT FELT LIKE TORTURE.

38:30.141 --> 38:33.178
- HMM, LOOKS LIKE CAZA'S GOT
A NEW INTERROGATION METHOD.

38:33.211 --> 38:36.214
CHEAPER THAN WATERBOARDING,
WITHOUT ALL THE MESS.

38:36.247 --> 38:37.816
- I APPRECIATE THE HELP.

38:37.849 --> 38:38.917
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, DOG?

38:38.950 --> 38:39.918
YOU HAD THEM
RIGHT WHERE YOU WANTED THEM.

38:39.951 --> 38:41.586
[both chuckle]

38:41.619 --> 38:43.188
THANKS FOR LEAVING ME
THE SCRAPS.

38:43.221 --> 38:44.522
- SURE.
[both chuckle]

38:44.556 --> 38:45.957
- YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE.
- OUT OF THE WAY.

38:45.990 --> 38:46.958
WE'RE FAMILY.

38:46.991 --> 38:48.126
MIKE, ARE YOU OKAY?

38:48.159 --> 38:49.861
I'M SO SORRY I WASN'T HERE.

38:49.894 --> 38:51.062
YOU OKAY?

38:51.062 --> 38:52.664
- CHUCK, LET HIM BREATHE.
- I'M OKAY.

38:52.697 --> 38:53.965
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

38:53.965 --> 38:56.067
- BET THAT DESK JOB
DOESN'T LOOK SO BAD NOW, HUH?

38:56.101 --> 38:57.635
- OH, YEAH, YOU KNOW,

38:57.669 --> 39:00.638
PUSHING PAPERS,
ANSWERING CALLS.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.741
- GLAD YOU'RE OKAY...

39:02.774 --> 39:04.776
ROCK STAR.

39:11.549 --> 39:12.951
- HEY, MIKE,

39:12.984 --> 39:15.220
LOOKS LIKE YOU GOT HIT
BY A COUPLE OF NEWBIES.

39:15.253 --> 39:16.755
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

39:16.788 --> 39:19.624
- THIS INK IS STILL FRESH,
AND THE SKIN IS RED AND PUFFY.

39:19.657 --> 39:23.027
THESE ARE SOME RAW RECRUITS.

39:23.061 --> 39:24.963
- THAT'S QUITE THE INITIATION.

39:27.132 --> 39:28.767
YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

39:28.800 --> 39:30.802
- YEAH, IF YOU'RE GONNA TORTURE
AND KILL A GUY,

39:30.802 --> 39:31.936
YOU DON'T SEND A FRESHMAN.

39:31.936 --> 39:33.738
- NO, YOU SEND
THE BEST YOU GOT.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.173
- THE PLASTIC BAGS ARE NEW.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.943
- MM, YEAH, HAVEN'T SEEN THAT
IN CAZA'S BOOK OF TRICKS.

39:40.612 --> 39:41.946
- THIS WASN'T CAZA.

39:47.431 --> 39:48.186
- HEY
- DON'T HEY ME.

39:48.186 --> 39:49.854
I HAVE TO FIND OUT
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE

39:49.854 --> 39:51.523
BY READING AN OP REPORT?

39:51.556 --> 39:53.858
- THIS IS THE FIRST CHANCE
I'VE HAD TO CALL.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.794
ARE YOU ALONE RIGHT NOW?

39:55.827 --> 39:56.995
- WHAT'S GOING ON, MIKE?

39:57.028 --> 39:59.197
- SO THE GUYS WHO GRABBED ME--
- DON'T WORRY.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.932
WE'VE ALREADY MOBILIZED
A SMALL ARMY

40:00.965 --> 40:02.167
TO HIT THE CAZA CARTEL.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.002
- GOOD, THAT'S GOOD,
BUT WASN'T THEM.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.637
- IT WASN'T WHO?

40:05.670 --> 40:08.640
- IT WASN'T CAZA.

40:08.673 --> 40:10.708
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40:10.708 --> 40:14.045
- JESS, I WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THE BUSES.

40:14.078 --> 40:17.015
- [sighs]

40:17.048 --> 40:18.950
GOD DAMN IT, MIKE.
- LISTEN, OKAY?

40:18.983 --> 40:20.585
THEY JUST KEPT ASKING ME,
"WHAT LINE?

40:20.618 --> 40:22.120
DO YOU KNOW THE LINE?"

40:22.153 --> 40:25.757
- DID THEY SAY "BUS LINE"?
- THEY SAID "BUS LINE."

40:25.790 --> 40:27.091
LOOK,
I DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING YET,

40:27.125 --> 40:28.259
BUT THAT'S WHY I NEED A TEAM.

40:28.293 --> 40:30.061
- YOU'RE ASKING ME
TO TAKE A RUN AT CAZA,

40:30.094 --> 40:31.763
WHO MAY OR MAY NOT
BE INVOLVED,

40:31.796 --> 40:32.997
AND THEN ASSIGN YOU A TEAM,

40:33.031 --> 40:35.066
SO YOU CAN KNOCK OVER
BUSES AGAIN.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.202
- IT'S WORTH IT, JESS.
THIS IS THE BIG ONE.

40:37.235 --> 40:39.637
PLEASE.

40:39.671 --> 40:42.073
- [sighs]

40:42.106 --> 40:44.843
THIS IS GONNA BE A TOUGH SELL
TO THE DIRECTOR.

40:44.876 --> 40:47.946
- I KNOW. I JUST NEED SOME TIME
AND AN OPERATING BUDGET.

40:47.979 --> 40:51.616
- AND A TEAM.
- AND A TEAM.

41:02.794 --> 41:04.028
- HEY, P-FUNK,
WHERE'S CHARLIE?

41:04.062 --> 41:05.163
- DOWNSTAIRS.

41:05.196 --> 41:08.132
- CHUCK.

41:08.166 --> 41:11.536
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

41:11.569 --> 41:13.771
- WHAT'S WITH THE YELLING?

41:13.805 --> 41:16.040
- EVERYBODY, MIKE HERE
HAS GOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

41:16.074 --> 41:19.043
- GONNA CALL JOHNNY
A BURNOUT AGAIN?

41:19.043 --> 41:21.646
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT.
- THANK YOU.

41:21.679 --> 41:24.616
- LISTEN, THE GUYS WHO, UH...

41:24.649 --> 41:27.652
YOU KNOW,
DID WHAT THEY DID TO ME,

41:27.685 --> 41:29.721
WERE PRETENDING TO BE CAZA.

41:29.754 --> 41:31.789
SO NOW THE QUESTION IS,
WHO WERE THEY?

41:31.789 --> 41:33.658
WHO ARE THEY WORKING FOR?

41:33.658 --> 41:35.927
FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS,
I'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING A THEORY

41:35.960 --> 41:38.162
THAT I THINK HOLDS THE ANSWER--

41:38.196 --> 41:39.597
BUSES...

41:39.631 --> 41:43.668
SMUGGLING CONTRABAND
IN PASSENGER BUSES.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.571
AND THE FBI HAS GIVEN ME
A TEAM TO PROVE IT.

41:46.604 --> 41:47.972
- GREAT.
- CONGRATS TO YOU, BRO.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.240
I'M SORRY I ALMOST HIT YOU.
- [laughs]

41:49.274 --> 41:51.009
- VOLLEYBALL, ANYBODY?
- YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.644
- GUYS, GUYS.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.846
I'M NOT DONE YET.

41:54.879 --> 41:57.248
YOU GUYS ARE MY TEAM.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.686
[sighs]

42:01.719 --> 42:05.156
ANYWAY,
I'LL BE MOVING BACK IN.

42:05.189 --> 42:08.560
THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WILL BE
IN CONTACT WITH YOUR SUPERVISORS

42:08.593 --> 42:09.827
TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS,

42:09.827 --> 42:12.530
BUT FOR THE NEXT EIGHT WEEKS,

42:12.564 --> 42:15.800
YOU GUYS WILL BE WORKING
FOR ME.

42:53.771 --> 42:56.140
[dog barks]
