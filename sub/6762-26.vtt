Dream on, dream away

01:38.419 --> 01:47.938
l think l'm gonna have to stay
Stay forever

01:48.701 --> 01:57.618
- l adore mi amor
- l adore, yeah

01:59.279 --> 02:05.789
- l adore mi amor
- l adore, yeah

02:05.964 --> 02:08.406
This is the greatest video
in the history of videos.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.608
Yeah, just great.

02:11.169 --> 02:13.209
Kelly, which one's your favourite?

02:13.380 --> 02:16.796
- l don't know which is which.
- Oh, well, that one's Bryan.

02:17.009 --> 02:18.836
l like him the best.

02:19.053 --> 02:20.844
Oh, no, maybe Mark. He's cuter.

02:21.056 --> 02:22.598
No, no, Bryan.

02:22.808 --> 02:24.302
l think Ringo's the cutest.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.312
God, l was into Color Me Badd
before anyone even heard of them.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.515
Yeah, you and 1 0,000 other people.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.939
Are you getting their concert
on pay-per-view tomorrow?

02:32.111 --> 02:35.361
Oh, even better. Let's go down
to Whisky and sit in the audience.

02:35.532 --> 02:37.821
Donna, those things
are by invitation only.

02:37.993 --> 02:40.033
But they're giving away
free passes on the radio.

02:40.246 --> 02:42.037
Donna, that is definitely a long shot.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.574
Come on.
You got skydiving lessons on the radio.

02:44.752 --> 02:48.584
- Don't remind me.
- So somebody must know someone.

02:48.757 --> 02:49.955
Look, it's no biggie.

02:50.133 --> 02:51.295
Since you like them so much,

02:51.468 --> 02:53.544
l'll call down to the club
and ask them to comp us.

02:53.721 --> 02:56.093
- You could get us in free?
- Yeah, right.

02:56.266 --> 02:59.267
l'm a DJ.
They rub my back, l rub theirs.

02:59.478 --> 03:01.471
David, please, l'm trying to eat.

03:05.694 --> 03:08.779
- We're looking for caller number 2 7.
- You dial now and then hang up.

03:08.948 --> 03:11.024
Then when you hear the signal,
you press redial,

03:11.201 --> 03:13.075
and you're already ahead
of the game.

03:13.245 --> 03:16.199
Bren, you are a genius.
Kelly, come on, get the phone ready.

03:16.374 --> 03:18.331
You guys, the concert
will be on TV tonight.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.744
Why don't we watch it at home?
This is such a big waste.

03:20.963 --> 03:22.422
Of what? Your precious time?

03:23.132 --> 03:24.875
Donna, l'm going to another one
of those

03:25.051 --> 03:27.127
marathon planning meetings
for the hospital charity.

03:27.346 --> 03:28.377
Okay.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.632
For all l know it could go well
into the night, so--

03:30.808 --> 03:32.635
Right, that's fine.
l'm sleeping at Brenda's.

03:32.853 --> 03:35.261
Well, if your father calls
from the Houston conference,

03:35.439 --> 03:36.518
would you tell him--?

03:36.691 --> 03:38.565
l know, that you'll be late.

03:39.736 --> 03:42.357
- Redial.
- Donna.

03:42.573 --> 03:44.150
- What do l do?
- Redial.

03:44.367 --> 03:47.653
- l'm not getting through.
- Donna, l'm speaking to you.

03:47.871 --> 03:50.196
Mom, l'm sorry,
but we're trying to win passes tonight

03:50.374 --> 03:51.572
for the concert at the Whisky.

03:51.793 --> 03:54.628
l don't want you hanging around
the Sunset Strip on a Saturday night.

03:54.796 --> 03:57.999
- Don't you think that's a little seedy?
- l don't know.

03:58.468 --> 04:00.295
Well, of course it is.

04:00.470 --> 04:01.845
l've gotta go. Bye, girls.

04:02.097 --> 04:03.840
- Hello.
- You've just won--

04:05.351 --> 04:07.178
Forget about it, Kelly.

04:07.354 --> 04:10.474
They just gave away
the last set of passes. Sorry.

04:10.649 --> 04:11.929
Thanks a lot, Mom.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.269
Ryan will just be lost without you.

04:14.487 --> 04:15.862
Bryan.

04:16.072 --> 04:18.825
l know his name, Donna.

04:23.624 --> 04:26.958
Do this long enough,
we'll qualify as legally dead.

04:27.128 --> 04:30.129
Come on, Dylan.
Can't you find something for us to do?

04:30.299 --> 04:34.131
Here, ad for liposuction. Any takers?

04:35.472 --> 04:37.465
Keep reading.

04:37.641 --> 04:39.135
Well, guys, we're off.

04:39.310 --> 04:41.468
Oh, where are you going
on this fine sunny day?

04:41.646 --> 04:44.137
We're going to the museum
for a lecture on Shaker furniture,

04:44.316 --> 04:45.858
followed by a authentic Shaker lunch.

04:46.026 --> 04:49.229
Followed by an afternoon
of Shaker music. Wanna come?

04:49.406 --> 04:52.193
- Come on, Jim.
- Have fun, Dad.

04:52.868 --> 04:54.777
What do you suppose
the babes are doing, anyway?

04:54.954 --> 04:57.908
Oh, whatever babe-like things babes
do on a rainy day.

04:58.083 --> 05:00.455
- Probably talking about us.
- Dream on.

05:00.628 --> 05:02.704
Let's do something
we can't do when they're around.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.042
What? Burp, swear, spit?

05:04.215 --> 05:07.465
No, no, let's take an adventure.
Let's go on a road trip.

05:07.636 --> 05:09.296
Come on,
three guys on the open road.

05:09.472 --> 05:11.049
Fast food, good tunes.

05:11.224 --> 05:12.635
- Vegas?
- Vegas.

05:12.809 --> 05:15.383
ln the pouring rain?
No, thanks. lt floods there--

05:15.563 --> 05:19.347
Okay, all, right. Look, right here,
an ad for massage services.

05:19.526 --> 05:20.724
ls this legit?

05:20.903 --> 05:23.359
Easy, tiger. l don't think
that's what we're looking for.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.607
Wait a second.
l saw an ad for strippers too.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.611
Steve, what's the big deal?
lt's a naked lady.

05:27.786 --> 05:28.900
Have you never seen one?

05:29.079 --> 05:33.576
Hey, seeing a genuine exotic dancer
is a milestone for a young man, okay?

05:33.752 --> 05:35.994
Thank you, Dr. Expert.

05:36.630 --> 05:39.833
l happen to have gone to two of my
cousin's bachelor parties this year.

05:40.010 --> 05:42.050
And they were all world, l might add.

05:42.221 --> 05:44.795
l guess that makes you
a veritable Rob Lowe, doesn't it?

05:44.974 --> 05:46.053
Let's just see.

05:46.226 --> 05:50.520
No, no, here we go. ''Brandy.''

05:52.400 --> 05:54.024
Brandy.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.532
Brandy, sounds like an lrish setter.

05:59.742 --> 06:02.031
Let's hope she's not.

06:04.039 --> 06:05.996
Hello, Brandy?

06:07.585 --> 06:09.625
Yeah. My name is Steve Sanders.

06:09.796 --> 06:13.497
l'm here with a few friends of mine
and l was wondering if...

06:13.676 --> 06:15.503
So the new guy, Tommy Yasko.

06:15.679 --> 06:17.755
- He's a Larry.
- Yeah, a little dork.

06:17.931 --> 06:19.390
Yeah, but Lauren is really cute.

06:19.558 --> 06:21.266
- Total babe.
- Do you think Andy's cute?

06:21.436 --> 06:22.467
- He's okay.
- Kind of.

06:22.646 --> 06:24.306
Hey, guys, what's the haps?

06:24.481 --> 06:26.972
- How did you get in here?
- The housekeeper let me in.

06:27.193 --> 06:28.817
Donna, you're gonna have
to talk to her.

06:29.279 --> 06:31.568
l'm about to give you
the gift of a lifetime.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.152
Color Me Badd is staying
at the Bel Age Hotel.

06:35.370 --> 06:36.568
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:36.788 --> 06:39.873
Their manager is a patient of my dad's.
He told me where they're staying.

06:40.042 --> 06:42.200
So what? We're supposed to go
and hang out with them?

06:42.378 --> 06:44.916
- Exactly.
- Sounds like a plan to me.

06:45.090 --> 06:46.121
l don't believe you.

06:46.300 --> 06:47.960
Kelly, what else do you have
to do today?

06:48.135 --> 06:50.258
Help your mother pick out
a wedding dress?

06:50.430 --> 06:51.544
Okay, l'll go.

06:51.723 --> 06:53.632
But l'm gonna go home
and change first.

06:53.809 --> 06:55.932
What do you care?
You don't even like the band.

06:56.104 --> 06:58.144
Well, at least l don't have to clear it
with my mom

06:58.315 --> 07:00.189
before l can go to a hotel
on the Strip.

07:00.359 --> 07:02.565
My mother doesn't run my life.
And we have to do this.

07:02.737 --> 07:04.943
Besides, David's got an in.

07:05.824 --> 07:07.567
What are all these people
doing here?

07:07.785 --> 07:09.493
l guess they also have an in.

07:09.662 --> 07:11.405
Well, l guess that blows that.

07:11.581 --> 07:13.657
No, Donna. Look.

07:37.321 --> 07:39.527
Whoa, where are you going?

07:39.741 --> 07:41.069
ln there.

07:41.284 --> 07:42.992
The hotel is for registered guests only.

07:43.954 --> 07:45.614
Yes, we know that.

07:45.832 --> 07:47.374
And in which room
are you registered?

07:50.087 --> 07:52.459
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

07:52.799 --> 07:54.293
Sure.

07:55.761 --> 07:58.596
- Let's just forget about this.
- Why?

07:58.764 --> 08:01.682
This is humiliating.
Who really cares?

08:01.851 --> 08:03.511
David, l don't think
this is gonna work.

08:03.687 --> 08:05.596
Wait a second, wait a second.

08:05.773 --> 08:07.600
Did l not know where they were?

08:07.775 --> 08:11.607
Yes, you and the population
of the Sherman Oaks Galleria.

08:11.780 --> 08:14.354
David, thanks for trying.
l know you're doing this for me,

08:14.534 --> 08:16.443
but it's not gonna work.

08:17.329 --> 08:19.120
Oh, yeah?

08:19.582 --> 08:21.290
Wait right here.

08:30.387 --> 08:31.667
Sanders, what are you doing?

08:31.847 --> 08:34.005
Just clearing a little space here
so Brandy can work.

08:34.183 --> 08:35.926
Do you mind?
She's gonna be here any minute.

08:36.102 --> 08:38.178
You know, you are some
piece of work, you know that?

08:38.355 --> 08:40.063
Yeah, yeah, so why are you here?

08:40.232 --> 08:43.434
Well, l figure if you guys feel we really
we need to see this,

08:43.611 --> 08:44.725
then l should be here for you.

08:44.905 --> 08:46.447
But you won't enjoy it at all.

08:46.615 --> 08:48.109
Hey, l am a human male.

08:48.284 --> 08:51.570
Really?
Brenda will be excited about that.

08:54.249 --> 08:58.579
- What's the problem?
- l don't know, you know...

08:58.755 --> 09:00.913
This is my parents' house.

09:01.091 --> 09:03.878
She's supposed to do her thing
right here, where my mom aerobicizes.

09:06.306 --> 09:08.215
She's here. She's here.

09:08.434 --> 09:09.714
What do l do?

09:09.935 --> 09:11.678
Answer the door.

09:13.982 --> 09:15.013
What do l say?

09:15.859 --> 09:18.231
l hear ''hello'' is really popular.

09:22.826 --> 09:25.198
- Hello.
- Brandon, hi.

09:25.413 --> 09:27.406
Andrea, what are you doing here?

09:27.582 --> 09:29.373
- Zuckerman moonlighting?
- No.

09:29.543 --> 09:31.536
l got this whole grab bag of ideas
for the paper.

09:31.712 --> 09:33.705
l knew today would be
a perfect day to brainstorm,

09:33.882 --> 09:36.338
since it's storming outside, get it?

09:37.678 --> 09:39.469
Hey, guys.

09:49.901 --> 09:52.475
Now, there is a fashion don't.

09:53.990 --> 09:56.825
And that guard over there is
giving us the world's hairiest eyeball.

09:56.994 --> 09:58.488
Really, you guys, let's just go.

09:58.662 --> 10:01.283
You know, David is probably in there
getting arrested right now.

10:01.457 --> 10:03.533
Do you think so?

10:04.628 --> 10:10.252
One for you, one for you
and one for you.

10:10.469 --> 10:12.343
We're in.

10:19.396 --> 10:22.267
lt's so easy. You just look them
straight in the eye

10:22.442 --> 10:24.933
and you tell them you want
a suite with a view.

10:25.112 --> 10:27.021
And ask if there's
any special rates that apply.

10:27.198 --> 10:30.781
- Don't you have to be 21 ?
- lf your plastic is good, you're in.

10:35.374 --> 10:36.998
Oh, my God.

10:37.210 --> 10:39.416
- Mom.
- Donna, what are you doing here?

10:39.630 --> 10:42.417
- David has a room here.
- What?

10:42.592 --> 10:45.546
l mean, David and his father
have a room here.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.258
See, their house is being
fumigated,

10:48.432 --> 10:50.674
so they checked into the hotel
for the night.

10:50.893 --> 10:52.850
And that's why
they have a room here.

10:53.021 --> 10:54.895
Just me and my dad.

10:55.691 --> 10:58.894
Aren't you supposed to be
at some charity thing or something?

10:59.070 --> 11:01.905
l am. lt's here.
We just broke for lunch.

11:03.284 --> 11:06.736
- Well, we're just picking up David.
- And here he is.

11:06.913 --> 11:09.665
But l forgot something,
so l've gotta go get it.

11:09.833 --> 11:10.947
The thing.

11:11.127 --> 11:12.372
Right, and then we're leaving.

11:12.587 --> 11:14.129
- Okay. l'll see you tomorrow.
- Right.

11:14.339 --> 11:15.916
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

11:16.091 --> 11:17.502
Bye.

11:30.192 --> 11:33.561
Hi, this is Brandy.
l'm not home right now, but--

11:33.738 --> 11:36.063
Damn it. She's on her way.

11:43.625 --> 11:46.081
Have you ever been
to the Tar Pits Museum, Andrea?

11:46.253 --> 11:47.415
lt's really a great place.

11:47.588 --> 11:50.079
A lot of people spend their whole lives
in L.A. and never go.

11:50.258 --> 11:52.001
lt's very interesting.

11:52.219 --> 11:54.010
Good thing to do
on a rainy day.

11:54.222 --> 11:56.262
Kind of thing you can really enjoy
on your own.

11:56.474 --> 11:59.095
l know. l've been, many times.

11:59.311 --> 12:01.553
But have you been there recently?

12:02.607 --> 12:04.564
Where are you going?

12:04.901 --> 12:06.015
To the kitchen, for water.

12:06.195 --> 12:10.692
- ls that okay?
- Yeah, sure.

12:10.867 --> 12:12.610
l was just kidding around.

12:14.413 --> 12:16.322
Can't she tell that we're busy here?

12:16.541 --> 12:19.032
Steve, tell her that she has to leave
because any minute now,

12:19.211 --> 12:22.129
you're expecting a strange woman to
come in here and get naked to music.

12:22.340 --> 12:25.460
- She'll understand.
- Probably write a four-part series.

12:25.677 --> 12:27.800
Guys, this is serious.

12:32.686 --> 12:35.557
- Hi, l'm Brandy.
- Hi, l'm Andrea.

12:35.731 --> 12:38.020
So are you ready to rock 'n' roll?

12:38.193 --> 12:40.565
Andrea, this is Brandy.
Brandy, this is Andrea.

12:41.280 --> 12:42.478
- We know.
- We know.

12:42.698 --> 12:47.028
- Brandy is-- Brandy is...
- Cindy's niece.

12:47.245 --> 12:50.579
Yes, yes. Very, very distant niece.

12:50.750 --> 12:53.502
l'm glad to meet you.
So are you from Minneapolis?

12:53.670 --> 12:54.998
Well...

12:56.382 --> 12:58.956
Sure. Originally.

12:59.177 --> 13:00.339
Yeah.

13:01.304 --> 13:03.131
- Can l take your coat?
- No.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.343
Yeah, sure, it's fine.

13:07.938 --> 13:12.647
- So what brings you here?
- Well, let's go in the living room.

13:12.819 --> 13:17.066
Brandy came to help me
with my genealogy report.

13:17.241 --> 13:20.610
See, she came over here
to tell me about...

13:20.829 --> 13:23.320
Kelly, what are you doing?

13:24.583 --> 13:27.157
Well, what do you think? ls it me?

13:27.337 --> 13:30.089
Don't take that. They charge you
for everything here.

13:30.257 --> 13:31.716
Twenty-five dollars for egg rolls?

13:31.884 --> 13:34.458
They must be
absolutely amazing egg rolls.

13:34.637 --> 13:37.424
Come on, guys. Let's focus here.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.307
Now, this is base camp.

13:39.477 --> 13:41.885
lf any of us get separated,
we meet back up here.

13:42.105 --> 13:44.311
l don't think this is such a good idea
anymore.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.184
Your mom's meeting
is not in this room.

13:46.402 --> 13:48.774
But if she finds out l lied to her,
she'll kill me.

13:48.988 --> 13:50.019
You always say that.

13:50.198 --> 13:53.448
Why don't you just let her
kill you and get it over with?

13:53.953 --> 13:56.705
Hi, Bryan Abrams, please.
He's in Color Me Badd.

13:56.873 --> 13:58.581
l'm sorry,
l have no listing for that name.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.125
- Are you sure?
- Yes, l am.

14:00.294 --> 14:01.954
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:02.130 --> 14:04.336
There's nobody registered
under that name.

14:04.507 --> 14:06.416
Come on, Brenda.
We have to be smart about this.

14:06.593 --> 14:09.001
They always register under aliases.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.555
We know the manager
is staying here

14:10.723 --> 14:12.431
and he'll be on the same floor
as the band.

14:12.601 --> 14:15.887
- And he won't be under a fake name.
- Exactly.

14:17.816 --> 14:18.847
Front desk.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.979
Yes, could you please tell me
what room Freddie Kramer is in?

14:22.154 --> 14:24.360
l can't give you the room number
but l'll connect you.

14:24.532 --> 14:25.730
Okay.

14:26.785 --> 14:29.786
They can't give me the room number
but she's gonna ring me through.

14:29.956 --> 14:32.993
- What are you gonna say?
- Yeah, what do you want?

14:33.794 --> 14:36.581
Freddie? Hi, listen--

14:41.845 --> 14:42.924
Like this?

14:43.138 --> 14:46.223
Look, l just said my dad
does his gum work, okay?

14:46.393 --> 14:49.062
Now, we're gonna have
to do some detective work.

14:49.229 --> 14:50.308
Probably in the lobby.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.721
My mother might be there.

14:51.899 --> 14:53.476
So what?
You'll think of some excuse.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.445
- We'll be your lookouts, right, Kel?
- Yeah.

14:57.406 --> 14:58.865
All right, let's go.

15:53.142 --> 15:55.550
Penthouse level, here we come.

15:55.728 --> 15:57.970
What are we gonna say?

15:58.189 --> 16:00.182
l'm gonna ask them
what their favourite colour is.

16:00.359 --> 16:02.435
Their favourite colour is Badd,
of course.

16:02.612 --> 16:03.810
Guys, you don't ask them that.

16:03.988 --> 16:05.862
You tell them something smart
about their music

16:06.032 --> 16:07.989
and then they respect you.

16:09.245 --> 16:11.036
Why aren't we moving?

16:11.539 --> 16:13.366
lt's locked.

16:14.752 --> 16:17.077
Oh, come on, guys.
Don't give up so easily.

16:17.255 --> 16:20.256
We've just begun the fight.
We still have a plan B.

16:20.425 --> 16:22.216
What's plan B?

16:22.386 --> 16:27.095
Plan B is to think of a plan B.

16:42.661 --> 16:44.120
This is sort of fun.

16:53.591 --> 16:57.007
lt's locked. Let's try the backstairs.

16:58.848 --> 17:00.924
Kelly, don't even think about it.

17:01.100 --> 17:03.769
- Kelly, you can't.
- Watch me.

17:07.942 --> 17:10.231
- What about David and Brenda?
- They'll be fine.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.859
Kelly, we could get arrested.
l'm getting out.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.989
Donna.

17:15.285 --> 17:18.819
- You don't even like Color Me Badd.
- Well, l do now.

17:21.501 --> 17:23.707
Donna? Kelly?

17:24.671 --> 17:27.790
- David.
- They'll catch up.

17:33.599 --> 17:35.093
Locked.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.025
David Silver,
this is a wild goose chase.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.193
We're locked in here
and we lost Donna and Kelly.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.576
They're right in here.
We're just back in the basement.

17:52.748 --> 17:56.331
Trust me.
And the door's unlocked.

17:59.089 --> 18:00.548
- David--
- The door.

18:08.183 --> 18:11.718
l am ready for dessert,
how about you?

18:20.949 --> 18:22.324
Yes.

18:51.362 --> 18:53.520
Hi, Dr. John Martin, please.

18:53.698 --> 18:55.940
He's at the medical conference.

18:57.870 --> 19:00.575
Can you have him call Donna,
his daughter?

19:00.748 --> 19:07.630
My number? 31 0-KL5-5600.

19:07.965 --> 19:10.041
Room 61 2.

19:10.969 --> 19:13.009
Can you tell him it's very important?

19:13.180 --> 19:14.674
Thank you.

19:21.774 --> 19:23.434
l think she likes me.

19:23.610 --> 19:26.066
Yeah, l can see why.
You're one big ball of charm.

19:26.238 --> 19:29.738
- We've gotta get Andrea out of there.
- Yeah, before they bond for life.

19:29.951 --> 19:32.240
So, what are you studying at UCLA?

19:32.412 --> 19:34.868
Well, l'm going for my Masters
in social work

19:35.041 --> 19:36.998
but it's taking me a while.

19:37.168 --> 19:41.462
l can only go part-time because l have
a 5-year-old to raise and support.

19:41.632 --> 19:44.467
How in the world do you
make ends meet?

19:44.636 --> 19:46.545
You'd be surprised.

19:47.473 --> 19:50.391
l do a lot of office temp work

19:50.560 --> 19:53.134
and actually, l work a lot of parties.

19:53.313 --> 19:57.477
You know, party-planning,
event-coordinating. That sort of thing.

19:57.652 --> 20:01.353
- Sounds like fun.
- lt's a living.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.581
So whose are you?

20:16.759 --> 20:18.586
No one's. Whose are you?

20:18.761 --> 20:21.050
Nobody's, yet.

20:21.264 --> 20:22.639
Which one are you interested in?

20:22.850 --> 20:23.929
Doesn't matter.

20:24.101 --> 20:26.557
Any of them. All of them.

20:26.729 --> 20:28.686
l don't get it.
What do you want from them?

20:28.857 --> 20:31.562
You know, to party.

20:33.947 --> 20:35.690
How do you know
they wanna party with you?

20:35.866 --> 20:37.609
Most of the bands do.

20:37.785 --> 20:39.908
What the hell, it's worth a try, right?

20:40.329 --> 20:41.740
Different strokes.

20:42.791 --> 20:44.071
And what are you doing here?

20:44.251 --> 20:46.742
You don't exactly look like their
accountant or nothing to me.

20:46.921 --> 20:49.246
No, l'm not a groupie or anything.

20:49.424 --> 20:51.251
See, me and my friends thought
it would be fun

20:51.426 --> 20:54.297
to see if we could get in here
and meet the band.

20:54.472 --> 20:55.966
Then what?

20:56.474 --> 20:57.588
That's all.

20:58.393 --> 21:00.386
Different strokes.

21:01.105 --> 21:03.263
Cool it, girlfriend. There's a cop.

21:12.327 --> 21:16.277
Damn. This crazy machine
won't take my money.

21:17.333 --> 21:21.331
- Here, try a crisp one.
- Oh, yeah.

21:23.299 --> 21:24.959
You're welcome. Hello.

21:25.135 --> 21:27.970
l'm sorry. l guess
you're not the money lady, huh?

21:28.180 --> 21:30.932
No, l don't think so. l'm Kelly Taylor.

21:31.142 --> 21:34.511
lt's nice to meet you, Kelly.
l'm Bryan Abrams. Thanks a lot.

21:35.689 --> 21:37.563
Oh, my God.

21:37.734 --> 21:40.023
- ls everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

21:40.237 --> 21:42.942
You know, we have people
to do things for you.

21:43.115 --> 21:45.440
Where is my runner?
You know, l'm gonna can his butt.

21:45.618 --> 21:48.323
lt's all right, you know, l like to get
my own soda once in a while.

21:48.539 --> 21:50.448
- lt's all right?
- Yeah.

21:50.791 --> 21:53.080
- Okay.
- All right, thanks.

21:54.546 --> 21:58.211
Hey, l was thinking
you might like a pass.

21:58.426 --> 21:59.837
You can check out the show
later on.

22:01.179 --> 22:03.053
No, l couldn't really.

22:03.265 --> 22:04.296
Oh, come on.

22:05.560 --> 22:10.021
Well, l have three friends.
Could l get four?

22:10.649 --> 22:12.606
Okay, you talked me into it.
Come on.

22:12.819 --> 22:14.313
l'll get you as many as you need.

22:14.487 --> 22:16.645
You know what?
l've got three friends too.

22:16.824 --> 22:18.104
- Do you?
- Yeah.

22:18.284 --> 22:19.778
Really?

22:19.994 --> 22:21.654
You know, David,
why can't you just admit

22:21.830 --> 22:24.748
that you don't know everything there
is to know about hotels and bands?

22:24.917 --> 22:26.292
Never said that l knew everything.

22:26.460 --> 22:28.785
lf you're smart, why'd you
let the door close behind us?

22:28.964 --> 22:31.455
l suppose l'm to blame
for getting us locked out in the rain.

22:31.634 --> 22:32.879
- Oh, come on.
- Where's Kelly?

22:33.052 --> 22:34.214
Last time l saw her,

22:34.387 --> 22:36.593
she was in the elevator
on her way up to see the band.

22:36.807 --> 22:39.096
For real?
We've got to catch up with that girl.

22:39.310 --> 22:40.804
Wait a minute.

22:41.354 --> 22:43.228
l mean, you're tired
and you're soaked

22:43.398 --> 22:45.022
and you must
really wanna leave, right?

22:45.234 --> 22:47.143
Donna, there's towels
and there's a hair dryer.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.351
l mean, look at us.

22:48.529 --> 22:51.150
lf we quit now, we're pretty pathetic.

22:51.742 --> 22:54.067
lt just seems so impossible.

22:54.245 --> 22:56.701
Come on, Donna,
you're dying to meet this band.

22:56.873 --> 22:58.700
We already know they're here.

22:58.875 --> 23:02.125
l'm gonna make this happen for you.
You can't give up so easily.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.627
Yeah, thanks.

23:09.722 --> 23:13.506
You know, seeing you here reminds
me of the time we met Bon Jovi.

23:13.685 --> 23:15.843
Yeah, we know what it's like
to be fans.

23:16.063 --> 23:17.806
Oh, l'm not really that big of a fan.

23:18.024 --> 23:19.138
Well, thanks a lot.

23:19.359 --> 23:24.022
No, no, no. l mean, l think you guys
are great, really. l mean it.

23:24.198 --> 23:27.365
l'm not some, like, totally weird
groupie fan.

23:27.536 --> 23:29.778
You know, the kind who...
l don't know.

23:29.956 --> 23:32.494
The kind who sneaks
into hotels maybe?

23:33.084 --> 23:35.789
Exactly.
So, what's it like to have fans?

23:35.963 --> 23:38.834
Honestly? l love it, personally.

23:39.008 --> 23:40.502
But l don't know, what do you think?

23:40.719 --> 23:42.593
- lt's amazing.
- Scary.

23:43.597 --> 23:45.471
Well, l mean, don't get me wrong,

23:45.642 --> 23:48.133
because, you know, we definitely
love meeting our fans.

23:48.312 --> 23:52.096
lt's just when a large crowd of people
come at you at one time,

23:52.275 --> 23:53.899
you know,
it can be kind of confusing.

23:54.110 --> 23:55.604
But we're not complaining
or anything.

23:55.779 --> 23:57.819
l mean, that's what
we've always wanted, so...

23:58.032 --> 24:00.357
Sometimes, it's just easier
to stay up here, you know?

24:00.535 --> 24:02.326
Yeah, what he said.

24:03.330 --> 24:04.492
So is it true what they say,

24:04.665 --> 24:06.907
you can't even go to a mall
without getting mobbed?

24:07.085 --> 24:08.544
Sad but true.

24:08.753 --> 24:11.754
Well, don't worry.
l am personally sick of malls.

24:11.966 --> 24:14.753
Really? l kind of miss it.

24:17.473 --> 24:19.382
You know, maybe Kelly
got trapped somewhere too.

24:19.558 --> 24:21.266
We should probably go look for her.

24:21.436 --> 24:23.844
Come on, she probably just
got bored and did something else.

24:24.022 --> 24:25.682
We dragged her into this
and she's right.

24:25.858 --> 24:28.349
- Who really cares? l don't need to--
- l can't believe this.

24:28.528 --> 24:31.613
Because you're afraid of running into
your mother at stupid charity meeting.

24:31.782 --> 24:34.653
l know you guys are doing this all
for me, which is fine, thanks a lot.

24:34.827 --> 24:37.698
lf this is for me, don't l get to say
when l don't wanna do it anymore?

24:37.914 --> 24:39.788
God, you guys are driving me crazy.

24:39.959 --> 24:42.415
Donna, we just thought
that you would--

24:43.588 --> 24:44.750
Hello.

24:44.965 --> 24:46.708
Hi, Dad.

24:47.927 --> 24:53.966
No, it wasn't real important.
l just called to say hi.

24:54.143 --> 24:55.518
So, hi.

24:55.686 --> 24:59.138
Oh, well, David
and his father checked in,

24:59.316 --> 25:02.981
so we came to hang by the pool
but it's raining.

25:05.073 --> 25:06.816
Yeah, l'm sure.

25:08.452 --> 25:12.153
l love you too, Dad. Bye.

25:19.341 --> 25:21.084
Donna, what's wrong?

25:22.595 --> 25:24.006
What's wrong?

25:26.182 --> 25:29.468
My mother is having an affair.

25:39.449 --> 25:42.201
Anyway, apart from having
my little boy,

25:42.369 --> 25:46.319
the Peace Corps was the most
fantastic experience of my life.

25:46.541 --> 25:48.083
And it's where l met my husband.

25:48.293 --> 25:49.835
Your husband?

25:50.003 --> 25:52.790
- George, the father of my son.
- George.

25:53.424 --> 25:56.959
He's working on his first novel,
for three years.

25:57.137 --> 25:59.675
So l'm supporting him too.

25:59.849 --> 26:02.684
- The book's called The Zen of Surfing.
- Are you serious?

26:02.894 --> 26:05.979
- lt sounds really flaky, doesn't it?
- No, surfing is Zen.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.271
Pure meditation.
l'd love to read that book.

26:08.485 --> 26:10.941
Well, l wish everyone could.

26:11.113 --> 26:14.150
Maybe someday. Have faith.

26:14.409 --> 26:15.654
Look, l gotta go.

26:16.453 --> 26:19.158
l really liked meeting you.

26:19.373 --> 26:21.864
l really enjoyed meeting you too,
Andrea.

26:22.043 --> 26:25.412
l'd love to talk to you again.
Brandon, you have her number?

26:25.631 --> 26:27.291
l know where to get it.

26:27.508 --> 26:30.462
Great, l'll show myself out.

26:30.845 --> 26:32.885
- See you, bye.
- Bye-bye.

26:33.057 --> 26:35.975
- Bye, guys. Take care.
- Later, kid. Bye.

26:40.608 --> 26:42.850
Now are we ready to rock 'n' roll?

26:56.085 --> 26:59.454
Oh, hey, guys, you think a burger
comes with that shake?

27:09.852 --> 27:11.227
Yeah. Definitely.

27:14.149 --> 27:15.394
Destiny.

27:21.366 --> 27:24.901
- ls something wrong?
- No, nothing.

27:25.621 --> 27:29.619
l don't know. lt's like, you're kind
of our friend now, you know?

27:29.793 --> 27:32.284
Don't worry. lt doesn't embarrass me
or anything.

27:32.463 --> 27:38.965
Yeah, l know, but l just
kind of feel weird about it now.

27:39.263 --> 27:41.220
Bad timing, huh?

27:41.433 --> 27:46.309
Yeah, what do you say, Steve?
Let's pay up, call it a day.

27:49.484 --> 27:52.319
All right. l guess you guys are right.

27:52.488 --> 27:57.234
No offence, but l guess it would be
kind of bizarre to see you naked now.

27:57.452 --> 27:59.990
Now that we know you so well.

28:00.373 --> 28:03.707
But thanks.

28:15.016 --> 28:17.341
- Hi.
- Hello.

28:17.561 --> 28:19.304
Hi, l'm Brandy.

28:19.521 --> 28:21.929
- Nice to meet you.
- l'm Cindy's cousin.

28:23.318 --> 28:24.895
Sorry, gotta run. See you.

28:25.112 --> 28:26.855
Bye.

28:27.031 --> 28:29.024
Yeah, it is getting late.

28:29.200 --> 28:31.952
l'm gonna run too. Bye, bud.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.243
l'm leaving. See you.

28:34.915 --> 28:39.494
- Later.
- Cindy's cousin?

28:39.671 --> 28:43.206
Different Cindy. Cindy Sanders.

28:43.384 --> 28:46.053
Steve's cousin, Cindy Sanders.
Cindy Sanders.

28:46.221 --> 28:48.463
- How was the Shaker thing?
- lt was really interesting.

28:48.641 --> 28:50.717
But if Brandy
is Steve's cousin's cousin,

28:50.893 --> 28:53.431
wouldn't she be Steve's cousin?

28:53.730 --> 28:55.888
Well, you know, California families.

28:56.066 --> 28:58.142
Divorce, remarriage, who knows?

28:58.319 --> 29:00.810
My thoughts exactly.

29:07.455 --> 29:10.540
Are you sure that
it's not just a misunderstanding?

29:10.710 --> 29:12.952
l mean, the thought of your mom...

29:13.129 --> 29:15.038
lt just doesn't compute.

29:15.215 --> 29:17.124
Yeah, l mean, maybe it was
just a friendly kiss.

29:17.301 --> 29:18.961
You might have seen it
out of context.

29:19.137 --> 29:20.761
l know what l saw.

29:20.972 --> 29:24.009
You can't jump to any conclusions
until you talk to your mom.

29:24.852 --> 29:26.132
What's gonna happen now?

29:26.312 --> 29:28.981
What's gonna happen
when my dad finds out?

29:29.858 --> 29:31.317
My whole life is gonna change now.

29:32.194 --> 29:34.068
But, Donna,
maybe your life won't change.

29:34.239 --> 29:36.279
l mean, maybe your dad
already knows.

29:36.450 --> 29:38.941
He and your mom could have
some sort of arrangement.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.199
How can you say that?

29:40.413 --> 29:42.453
Because it happens all the time.

29:42.624 --> 29:45.162
Practically every kid at West Beverly
has the same story.

29:45.377 --> 29:48.414
Well, l don't care about every kid
at West Beverly.

29:48.631 --> 29:51.003
Donna, David was just trying
to make it easier.

29:51.176 --> 29:52.207
l'm sorry.

29:52.428 --> 29:55.133
Look, you guys, this just isn't working.
l have to get out of here.

29:55.306 --> 29:57.512
- You can stay.
- No, we're going with you.

29:58.769 --> 30:00.393
- Brenda Walsh?
- That's me.

30:00.563 --> 30:02.354
There's a call for you over here.

30:02.899 --> 30:04.358
Thanks.

30:08.531 --> 30:10.654
- Hello?
- l am with the band

30:10.825 --> 30:12.901
and they are the coolest guys.
And guess what.

30:13.078 --> 30:15.284
l got us all passes
for tonight's show.

30:15.498 --> 30:18.748
Way to go, Kelly.
l can't believe you actually did it.

30:18.919 --> 30:21.291
l don't think we're gonna be able to go.

30:21.505 --> 30:23.248
What do you mean?
We're in the front row.

30:26.386 --> 30:28.462
Donna saw her mother
with another man.

30:28.681 --> 30:31.552
Oh, my God. l'll be right down.

30:31.768 --> 30:34.473
No, it's okay. We're just gonna
take her back to my house.

30:34.646 --> 30:37.517
- Bren, l wanna be with her.
- Kelly, go to the concert.

30:37.692 --> 30:41.821
Look, she'd kill you if you didn't go
and report back all the details.

30:41.989 --> 30:43.364
Are you sure?

30:43.532 --> 30:46.735
Yeah, l don't think she's ready
to talk about all this yet, anyway.

30:47.245 --> 30:49.368
Look, l'll talk to you later. Bye.

30:54.087 --> 30:55.747
We'll catch her later.

30:55.923 --> 30:58.165
Do you wanna come
get the car with me?

30:58.342 --> 31:00.631
Thanks. l'm all right.

31:02.556 --> 31:04.216
We're out of here.

31:05.017 --> 31:06.641
David, thank you.

31:06.811 --> 31:08.435
Donna.

31:11.358 --> 31:13.647
Mrs. Martin, we were just leaving.

31:13.820 --> 31:16.940
lt's all right.
l'll meet you outside, okay?

31:22.038 --> 31:23.912
l thought you were going home
hours ago.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.204
How was your charity meeting?

31:27.420 --> 31:30.457
l've been up to my ears
in committees and budgets.

31:30.632 --> 31:33.467
l asked you a question.
What are you doing here?

31:33.636 --> 31:36.554
No, Mother.
What are you doing here?

31:37.891 --> 31:39.089
l saw you.

31:39.310 --> 31:40.970
Yes, on my lunch break.

31:41.145 --> 31:45.392
No, Room 622.

31:45.567 --> 31:47.358
l saw you, Mom.

31:47.570 --> 31:49.646
l don't know what you saw.

31:49.864 --> 31:52.355
You were laughing
and then you were kissing.

31:52.576 --> 31:53.774
lt was in the hallway.

31:53.953 --> 31:55.993
l don't think this is the time
or the place.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.485
Are you?

31:58.625 --> 32:01.081
Are you having an affair?

32:01.295 --> 32:03.169
- Are you?
- Donna.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.628
l will not let you
speak to me this way.

32:05.842 --> 32:08.713
Then just answer me.

32:09.847 --> 32:11.092
Are you, Mom?

32:25.158 --> 32:29.203
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my side.
- All is fair in love and puzzles.

32:31.457 --> 32:32.488
Hi, girls.

32:32.667 --> 32:35.787
Oh, Donna, your mother called
looking for you while you were gone.

32:35.963 --> 32:38.371
l shouldn't even have told her
l was sleeping over here.

32:39.175 --> 32:41.631
- Why? What's wrong?
- Can l tell her?

32:41.803 --> 32:44.721
Why not? Everyone's gonna know
soon enough.

32:45.725 --> 32:48.014
Donna had kind of a weird thing
happen to her today.

32:48.729 --> 32:51.018
She saw-- l mean, that is--

32:51.232 --> 32:53.604
My mother is having an affair.

32:53.818 --> 32:55.941
Oh, my God.

32:56.154 --> 32:58.562
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

33:00.034 --> 33:02.442
l can't believe l was so stupid.

33:02.621 --> 33:05.077
l actually thought that l had a family.

33:05.249 --> 33:08.036
Donna, you do have a family.
lt's just...

33:09.629 --> 33:12.167
Oh, l don't know what to say.
l'm sorry.

33:12.383 --> 33:16.512
Well, you don't have to figure
this all out right now.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.794
When will l?

33:18.015 --> 33:20.506
Aren't l entitled to know
how long this has been going on?

33:20.726 --> 33:22.849
lf my parents are getting a divorce?

33:23.021 --> 33:25.144
Who my mother's seeing?

33:26.275 --> 33:28.849
Why can't everything
just be the way it was?

33:29.070 --> 33:32.854
Look at you guys.
Your family never changes.

33:36.621 --> 33:37.949
Excuse me.

33:40.042 --> 33:42.035
Sure it changes.

33:43.046 --> 33:44.706
Hi, is Donna here?

33:44.881 --> 33:45.912
Yes, come right in.

33:46.091 --> 33:47.834
l've been expecting her
for several hours.

33:48.010 --> 33:49.884
She hasn't checked in.

33:50.889 --> 33:52.134
Oh, there you are.

33:52.349 --> 33:54.258
You know how l worry about you.

33:54.435 --> 33:55.715
Excuse me.

33:59.107 --> 34:01.313
- Donna, let's go home.
- Does Dad know?

34:01.485 --> 34:04.688
- We'll discuss this when we get home.
- Fine, l'll ask him myself.

34:04.864 --> 34:06.691
No, you won't.

34:06.909 --> 34:08.783
Look, Donna.

34:08.953 --> 34:12.405
Things happen in a marriage
that are hard to understand.

34:12.623 --> 34:14.166
You want me to understand?

34:14.333 --> 34:16.576
l understand you.
l understand what a hypocrite you are.

34:16.795 --> 34:17.909
Donna--

34:18.130 --> 34:19.922
Like when the whole condom issue
came up,

34:20.091 --> 34:22.842
weren't you the one who went
on and on about abstinence?

34:23.012 --> 34:25.170
God, you wouldn't even let me go
to a concert tonight.

34:25.348 --> 34:27.554
Because it was what?
What did you say, too seedy?

34:27.768 --> 34:29.761
Donna, do not raise your voice
at me.

34:29.978 --> 34:33.228
Why? God forbid, someone
might think that l'm angry.

34:33.440 --> 34:37.060
You care more about appearances,
Mom, than how anyone feels.

34:37.822 --> 34:41.440
Well, l'm angry and l'm not gonna
hide it for appearance's sake.

34:41.659 --> 34:45.195
All right, Donna. l am not gonna speak
to you until you calm down.

34:45.414 --> 34:47.074
Fine, then don't.

34:47.250 --> 34:48.578
Just go.

34:48.793 --> 34:53.005
And l hope you and your boyfriend
have a wonderful life, Felice.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.252
l just can't deal with her anymore.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.135
- Cindy.
- lt's okay.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.940
lt's one of those, you know,
mother-daughter tensions.

35:07.108 --> 35:08.899
lt's that age.

35:09.069 --> 35:11.062
Shall l tell her she can stay here
for a while,

35:11.238 --> 35:14.275
just until things calm down?

35:15.159 --> 35:16.273
You're very sweet.

35:16.453 --> 35:19.205
lt's really-- lt's just one of those
mother-daughter things.

35:19.373 --> 35:21.662
Tell me about it.

35:21.834 --> 35:25.168
- You'll call if...?
- Yeah, l'll call.

35:25.964 --> 35:27.458
Thank you.

35:36.853 --> 35:38.893
Oh, Donna.

35:42.109 --> 35:44.814
Look, l'm not gonna pretend
l know how you feel,

35:44.988 --> 35:47.657
but there is something
l know so strongly.

35:47.866 --> 35:50.737
And you're just gonna have to trust me
on this because l'm a mother.

35:50.912 --> 35:52.454
What is it?

35:53.373 --> 35:54.701
Your mother loves you.

35:55.251 --> 35:57.327
- But--
- Wait a minute, just listen.

35:57.545 --> 35:59.668
Whatever she may have done
in her own life

35:59.840 --> 36:01.880
has nothing to do
with her love for you.

36:02.092 --> 36:03.503
How can that be?

36:03.678 --> 36:05.920
Until you become a mother,
you may not understand this.

36:06.097 --> 36:09.466
But the most important thing
in your life

36:09.643 --> 36:11.719
is the love between
you and your children.

36:11.938 --> 36:14.607
Why can't she prove it
by keeping our family together?

36:16.151 --> 36:18.227
Keeping a marriage
in perfect balance,

36:18.404 --> 36:21.239
it's like walking a tightrope.

36:21.450 --> 36:23.526
Anybody can slip.

36:23.702 --> 36:24.900
You never slip.

36:25.121 --> 36:26.948
Donna.

36:29.001 --> 36:30.875
Come on over here.

36:37.219 --> 36:39.710
l'm gonna tell you
something very private.

36:41.099 --> 36:43.934
Back when we first moved
to Beverly Hills,

36:44.103 --> 36:47.638
l ran into a man that had once been
very special to me.

36:47.857 --> 36:50.395
We'd gone in different directions.

36:50.694 --> 36:55.357
Anyway, seeing him again
with my whole life changing,

36:56.284 --> 36:59.071
the old spark flared between us.

37:00.456 --> 37:03.243
- You had an affair?
- Almost.

37:05.546 --> 37:08.631
Ultimately, l was lucky,
l didn't follow through on it.

37:09.467 --> 37:13.548
But who knows, really.

37:14.432 --> 37:17.635
But one thing l know
absolutely for sure.

37:17.811 --> 37:20.896
You don't stop loving your children.

37:23.318 --> 37:25.061
Honey,

37:25.612 --> 37:29.064
you don't wanna turn your back
on that kind of love.

37:37.502 --> 37:39.245
You think you know
where your life is headed

37:39.421 --> 37:41.248
and you get off an elevator
on the wrong floor

37:41.423 --> 37:42.965
and bang everything's different.

37:43.134 --> 37:45.008
So this is where the bull session is?

37:46.638 --> 37:47.883
Tough news about Donna.

37:48.098 --> 37:50.340
Yeah. l mean, it's so surreal.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.676
l mean,
this morning she was Donna.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.606
And now she's Donna,
but a completely different Donna.

37:56.442 --> 37:59.277
Same Donna,
more complicated world.

37:59.529 --> 38:01.071
And she could probably
use you two

38:01.239 --> 38:03.528
right about now
to help keep it simple.

38:04.410 --> 38:06.237
Us?

38:06.413 --> 38:07.872
Dad, we already feel like weirdos

38:08.040 --> 38:10.412
because you and Mom
are still together.

38:11.335 --> 38:14.040
My God, we really are square,
aren't we?

38:14.214 --> 38:15.245
We'll have to work on it.

38:15.465 --> 38:16.959
Yeah, well, don't work too hard.

38:18.719 --> 38:20.094
Oh, by the way,

38:20.263 --> 38:22.801
Steve's cousin
left her business card.

38:22.975 --> 38:25.431
- l'm a little late for work, Dad.
- Brandon,

38:25.603 --> 38:29.933
in two years, remind me to tell you
about my bachelor party.

38:40.955 --> 38:42.615
l didn't hear you come home.

38:54.430 --> 38:56.755
l understand that you're angry
with me.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.140
You have every right to be.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.099
Don't you love Dad anymore, Mom?

39:03.274 --> 39:05.101
Oh, of course, sweetheart.

39:05.277 --> 39:07.068
l love your father very much.

39:07.905 --> 39:10.361
- l love you too.
- Then how could you?

39:13.662 --> 39:16.414
Donna, this is hard for me too.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.621
What happened this afternoon...

39:21.213 --> 39:24.214
lt's the worst nightmare
l could ever imagine.

39:25.176 --> 39:29.126
l feel like all your faith in me
has been destroyed.

39:29.307 --> 39:30.338
lt has.

39:32.435 --> 39:37.774
And l feel like l've suddenly asked you
to grow up much too fast.

39:37.984 --> 39:41.187
Mom, l am grown-up.
l've been grown-up.

39:41.363 --> 39:45.492
Catching you with some guy
didn't suddenly make me an adult.

39:46.119 --> 39:48.693
lt just hurt me.

39:51.042 --> 39:52.999
lt hurt me so much.

39:53.169 --> 39:55.245
l know.

39:56.966 --> 39:58.875
l know it did.

39:59.260 --> 40:03.887
And l'm so sorry for that,
you have no idea.

40:05.142 --> 40:07.467
What's gonna happen to our family?

40:11.150 --> 40:14.104
Well, first of all,
l'm gonna tell your father

40:14.279 --> 40:16.485
about what happened this afternoon.

40:16.657 --> 40:18.697
l would never ask you
to keep this a secret.

40:18.909 --> 40:22.029
Good, because l couldn't.

40:23.498 --> 40:28.920
But most importantly,
l want you to understand.

40:29.089 --> 40:31.331
You must understand

40:31.508 --> 40:33.833
that no matter what happens
between your father and me,

40:34.011 --> 40:37.879
it has absolutely nothing to do
with our love for you.

40:41.103 --> 40:42.265
You...

40:43.648 --> 40:47.267
You are the most precious thing
in the world to both of us.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.274
Can you trust me on this?

40:52.826 --> 40:54.285
l guess.

40:56.414 --> 40:59.830
Mom, please try and work things out,
please?

41:01.921 --> 41:03.545
Okay.

41:15.688 --> 41:17.846
This is probably pretty lousy timing
on my part,

41:18.024 --> 41:20.811
but we came by to see
if you wanna go hang out tonight.

41:20.986 --> 41:24.521
Brenda and l are going
to the Peach Pit to have some dessert.

41:24.782 --> 41:26.822
Do you need to be rescued?

41:28.913 --> 41:33.326
Thanks, David, but l think l just
feel like hanging out alone tonight.

41:33.502 --> 41:34.996
Do you mind?

41:35.170 --> 41:37.495
Oh, no, no, that's no problem.

41:37.673 --> 41:39.831
l'll just-- l'll catch you
some other time, then.

41:40.010 --> 41:42.003
Why don't you go with them?

41:43.973 --> 41:45.716
l don't know.

41:46.684 --> 41:48.677
- lt just doesn't seem right.
- Go on.

41:48.854 --> 41:50.597
You're lucky to have
such great friends.

41:50.773 --> 41:53.181
Go on, go out and be with them
tonight.

41:59.075 --> 42:00.617
Thank you.

42:01.161 --> 42:02.869
l love you.

42:05.332 --> 42:06.363
l know.

42:13.384 --> 42:14.926
Thanks for coming, David.

42:15.095 --> 42:17.847
Well, we figured you could
probably use us.

42:18.015 --> 42:19.639
Yeah, can l.

42:19.809 --> 42:22.561
l never knew what it was like
to have problems.

42:23.063 --> 42:24.937
Well, welcome to the real world.

42:25.107 --> 42:28.856
Yeah, well, if this is the real world,
you can have it.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.860
All right, iced tea for the sis.

42:35.036 --> 42:36.696
- lsn't that my shirt?
- No.

42:36.871 --> 42:38.911
All right.
Fries, extra crispy for the DJ boy.

42:39.082 --> 42:43.495
And one mint chocolate marshmallow
jellybean extravaganza sundae.

42:43.713 --> 42:45.088
- Are you sure, Donna?
- Thank you.

42:45.257 --> 42:46.288
- Okay.
- Hey, you.

42:46.467 --> 42:47.498
- Hey, Kel.
- Kelly.

42:47.676 --> 42:49.834
- Hi.
- Did you go? How was it?

42:50.013 --> 42:51.756
Yes, l went. But how are you?

42:51.932 --> 42:53.343
Fine, fine. Tell us about the show.

42:53.517 --> 42:55.344
Did they sound good?
What did they sing?

42:55.853 --> 42:58.854
Yeah, they were okay.
l don't know the names of the songs.

42:59.024 --> 43:01.266
Anyway, l was thinking about you.

43:01.485 --> 43:03.145
You didn't have to.

43:03.362 --> 43:06.565
Well, l wanted to think of a way
to cheer you up.

43:06.783 --> 43:09.191
Anyway, l met these guys
and they're really, really nice.

43:09.412 --> 43:10.989
They wanted to know
where they could get

43:11.164 --> 43:13.655
the best hamburgers after
the concert. So l invited them here.

43:13.875 --> 43:15.583
They're waiting outside.

43:15.794 --> 43:17.585
l'll just go get them.

43:20.467 --> 43:23.136
She invited guys here
to cheer her up?

43:27.768 --> 43:29.096
Oh, my God.

43:29.311 --> 43:31.185
Donna? These are my friends.

43:31.355 --> 43:34.060
- Kevin, Mark, Bryan and Sam.

43:34.276 --> 43:36.150

- How you doing?

43:42.160 --> 43:44.616
- Oh, and David Silver.
- Thank you. How you doing?

43:44.830 --> 43:45.861
What's up there?

43:46.040 --> 43:47.867
So all of you
go to Beverly Hills High?

43:48.084 --> 43:49.708
West Beverly.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.245
So where's these famous burgers
everybody's talking about?

43:52.423 --> 43:53.834
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

43:54.008 --> 43:56.499
l can't believe they're here
and they're eating hamburgers.

43:56.720 --> 43:59.507
Well, actually, l was going
to make them sing for their supper.

43:59.682 --> 44:02.387
lt is standard operating procedure
around here, guys.

44:02.602 --> 44:04.179
Well, rules are rules.

44:04.354 --> 44:05.978
