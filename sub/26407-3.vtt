WEBVTT

00:27.114 --> 00:28.637
MAN: SO, WHAT'S
IN THE BOX?

00:28.680 --> 00:31.422
UM, TO BE HONEST,
NO IDEA.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.076
I MEAN, I COULD HAVE
SWORN I KEPT MYSELF

00:33.120 --> 00:35.078
FROM ACTUALLY ORDERING
ONE OF THOSE NEW TURBO DOG

00:35.122 --> 00:36.340
TREAT-TOSSING CAMERAS, BUT--

00:36.384 --> 00:37.646
EX

00:37.689 --> 00:39.169
OH, SERIOUSLY, PHIL,
YOU'D LOVE THIS THING.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.084
IT IS SO COOL.
IT WOULD LET ME WATCH

00:41.128 --> 00:44.044
AND FEED AND PLAY
WITH MR. WIDGET
ALL FROM RIGHT HERE.

00:44.087 --> 00:47.003
AHH, BECAUSE
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER

00:47.047 --> 00:48.961
HOPES IS TAKING PLACE
AT THE INTERNAL
REVENUE SERVICE.

00:49.005 --> 00:50.789
YEAH, WELL, I WAS
TRYING TO BE GOOD,

00:50.833 --> 00:53.357
WHICH IS WHY ALL I CAN
THINK IS MY MIND WAS SAYING NO,

00:53.401 --> 00:55.533
BUT MY FINGER WAS PRESSING
"PLACE ORDER NOW."

00:56.969 --> 01:00.582
OH, MY GOD!

01:00.625 --> 01:03.802
WHAT THE...

01:03.846 --> 01:05.456
OH, MY GOD.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.546
SOMEONE CALL 9-1-1. NOW!

01:08.590 --> 01:10.853
COME ON, COME ON.OH, MY GOD.

01:10.896 --> 01:13.160
DAVID.

01:13.203 --> 01:14.161
DAVID!

01:14.204 --> 01:15.640
CAN'T I GO
TO MY ROOM?

01:15.684 --> 01:17.120
NOT UNTIL WE TALK
ABOUT THIS.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.991
IN HERE.

01:21.168 --> 01:22.908
I KNOW SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR,

01:22.952 --> 01:26.086
YOU'VE HAD SOME TROUBLE
GETTING ALONG WITH
YOUR CLASSMATES.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.262
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING

01:28.305 --> 01:31.047
THAT MADE YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU HAD TO HIT SOMEBODY.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.266
I SAID I WAS SORRY.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.702
YOU SHOULD BE.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.921
THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR
THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR.

01:37.184 --> 01:39.055
YOU HEAR ME?MATT.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.796
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.

01:40.839 --> 01:44.147
DAVID, GO TO YOUR ROOM.

01:55.245 --> 01:56.899
IT'S WORK.

01:56.942 --> 01:58.205
I'M JUST GONNA
TAKE A SICK DAY.

01:58.248 --> 02:00.163
NO, NO, DON'T DO THAT,

02:00.207 --> 02:02.165
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW
THAT TEXT MEANS
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE

02:02.209 --> 02:04.080
OUT THERE IN A HELL
OF A LOT MORE TROUBLE
THAN WE ARE.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.648
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT ABOUT DAVID?

02:06.691 --> 02:09.694
WELL...

02:09.738 --> 02:11.783
SUDDEN SHIFTS
IN BEHAVIOR ARE USUALLY

02:11.827 --> 02:13.568
TIED TO SOMETHING
CHANGING AT HOME.

02:13.611 --> 02:15.918
AND HONESTLY,

02:15.961 --> 02:19.748
I THINK THAT SOMETHING
CHANGING HERE IS ME.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.141
KRISTY, THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH--

02:21.184 --> 02:22.794
WITH MY BEING
IN TRAUMA THERAPY

02:22.838 --> 02:25.101
BECAUSE I SURVIVED
BEING A HOSTAGE?

02:25.145 --> 02:28.757
WE KNOW DAVID IS
THE SENSITIVE ONE.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.367
SO WHEN YOUR MOM
ALL OF THE SUDDEN

02:30.411 --> 02:34.197
BECOMES OVERLY
PROTECTIVE AND STARTS
CANCELLING PLAY DATES,

02:34.241 --> 02:36.634
IT PROBABLY BECOMES
A LITTLE SCARY FOR HIM.

02:39.289 --> 02:42.205
TELL ME SOMETHING.

02:42.249 --> 02:45.165
WILL IT MATTER IF I SAY
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT?

02:46.383 --> 02:50.039
OF COURSE IT MATTERS,
LOVE OF MY LIFE.

02:50.082 --> 02:53.347
BUT RIGHT NOW, YOU
NEED TO SAVE THE WORLD

02:53.390 --> 02:56.176
AND I NEED TO SPEND
TIME WITH OUR SON.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.181
OK?

03:01.224 --> 03:03.270
OK.

03:06.142 --> 03:08.188
PRENTISS: THIS MORNING
D.C. METRO POLICE

03:08.231 --> 03:11.191
REPORTED THAT BODY PARTS
WERE SENT TO 6 SEPARATE
LOCATIONS

03:11.234 --> 03:13.105
WITHIN THE WASHINGTON
METROPOLITAN AREA.

03:13.149 --> 03:15.586
EACH APPENDAGE WAS
WRAPPED AND SEALED

03:15.630 --> 03:17.109
INSIDE ITS OWN BOX.

03:17.153 --> 03:19.329
IN ALL, THERE WERE
TWO ARMS WITH NO HANDS,

03:19.373 --> 03:23.159
TWO LEGS WITH NO FEET,
ONE TORSO CUT IN HALF
BUT WITHOUT THE HEAD.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.902
SO ALTHOUGH THIS UNSUB
FELT THE SADISTIC URGE
TO SHOCK AND AWE

03:26.945 --> 03:28.251
THE VICTIMS WHO
RECEIVED THE BOXES,

03:28.295 --> 03:30.253
HE WAS STILL ORGANIZED
ENOUGH TO WITHHOLD

03:30.297 --> 03:32.299
THE PARTS THAT WOULD
HAVE HELPED BETTER
IDENTIFY THE VICTIM.

03:32.342 --> 03:33.561
OH, BUT WAIT,
THERE'S MORE.

03:33.604 --> 03:37.086
IN EACH BOX, UNDERNEATH
THE VICTIM PIECES

03:37.129 --> 03:38.740
WAS AN INDEX CARD,

03:38.783 --> 03:41.482
AND ON EACH ONE, A PIECE
OF A HANDWRITTEN NOTE.

03:41.525 --> 03:44.267
REID: "ALL THE KING'S
PORSCHES AND ALL
THE KING'S BENZ

03:44.311 --> 03:47.705
"COULDN'T PUT THIS BITCH
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.359
FOREVER YOURS,
GONE POSTAL."

03:49.403 --> 03:52.319
DO WE KNOW WHO THE BOXES
WERE SENT TO AND HOW
THEY WERE DELIVERED?

03:52.362 --> 03:54.712
GARCIA: YES, THE UNSUB
USED AN OVERNIGHT
COURIER SERVICE

03:54.756 --> 03:57.454
CALLED WORLD SEND,
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE
ANY SECURITY FOOTAGE

03:57.498 --> 04:00.152
OF THE DROP OFF BECAUSE
THAT PARTICULAR BRANCH

04:00.196 --> 04:02.807
WAS CLOSED YESTERDAY
DUE TO A BIT OF
SCHEDULED REMODELING.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.680
SO THAT MEANS HE DOCTORED
THE TRACKING I.D.
ON THE BOXES.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.335
CORRECT. SO EACH OF
THE APPALLING PARCELS

04:08.378 --> 04:10.989
WERE ADDRESSED AND DELIVERED
TO 6 DIFFERENT PEOPLE,

04:11.033 --> 04:13.078
TWO WERE AT HOME,
4 WERE AT WORK.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.037
THEY RANGE IN OCCUPATIONS
FROM RETIRED TEACHER

04:15.080 --> 04:16.299
TO TAXPAYER ADVOCATE.

04:16.343 --> 04:19.259
THEY RANGE IN AGES
FROM 23 TO 68.

04:19.302 --> 04:21.348
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,
WHAT THEY ALL
GOT IN COMMON,

04:21.391 --> 04:22.740
THEY'RE ALL WOMEN.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.525
SIMMONS: PARTS OF ONE MAN
SENT TO 6 DIFFERENT WOMEN.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.527
WHAT'S STRANGE IS THAT
NONE OF THE WOMEN HAD

04:26.570 --> 04:28.398
A MISSING MALE FRIEND
OR SIGNIFICANT OTHER.

04:28.442 --> 04:30.705
BUT MAYBE OUR JOHN DOE HERE'S
THE REAL CONNECTION

04:30.748 --> 04:33.273
BETWEEN THE WOMEN,
WHETHER THEY KNOW IT OR NOT.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.492
OR MAYBE OUR UNSUB'S
CRIMES AREN'T
EXACTLY CONNECTED

04:35.536 --> 04:38.190
TO ONE ANOTHER IN
THE WAY WE WOULD
ORDINARILY THINK.

04:38.234 --> 04:40.236
BECAUSE HE COULD BE WRESTLING
WITH A SET OF MIXED MOTIVATIONS.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.065
I THINK SO.
SEPARATE AND DISTINCT
EMOTIONAL NEEDS

04:43.108 --> 04:45.546
THAT HE FEELS COMPELLED
TO FULFILL.

04:45.589 --> 04:48.331
SO THE DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT
OF THE MALE VICTIM

04:48.375 --> 04:49.332
WOULD FULFILL ONE NEED,

04:49.376 --> 04:51.203
THE SHIPPING OF
THE BODY PARTS

04:51.247 --> 04:52.683
TO THE FEMALE VICTIMS
WOULD FULFILL ANOTHER.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.250
YEAH. AND WHAT
ABOUT HIM TAUNTING US?

04:54.294 --> 04:56.165
I MEAN, I'D SAY
THAT'S ANOTHER
ONE OF HIS NEEDS.

04:56.208 --> 04:57.253
PRENTISS: WELL,
WE NEED TO STOP HIM.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.342
JJ, LUKE, INTERVIEW
THE WOMEN.

04:59.386 --> 05:03.128
TARA, SPENCE, FOCUS ON
THESE CARDS IN THE BOXES.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.305
PENELOPE, MATT, TAKE
A CLOSER LOOK AT WORLD SEND

05:05.348 --> 05:06.915
AND ITS EMPLOYEES.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.309
DAVE, YOU AND I WILL
FOLLOW UP ON THE AUTOPSY
OF OUR JOHN DOE.

05:11.354 --> 05:14.009
REPORTER: ARE YOU ABLE
TO CONFIRM WHAT WAS
INSIDE THE BOX

05:14.052 --> 05:16.054
THAT YOUR COLLEAGUE,
MS. RAPTIS, RECEIVED?

05:16.098 --> 05:19.144
WE'RE HEARING IT
MAY HAVE BEEN PART
OF A MALE TORSO.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.277
MAN: YES, I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.889
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO WOULD HAVE WANTED
TO DO THIS?

05:24.933 --> 05:27.327
NO, NOT AT ALL.

05:27.370 --> 05:29.764
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN
TO COMPREHEND THE MIND

05:29.807 --> 05:31.461
OF SOMEONE WHO COULD
DO SOMETHING LIKE--

06:37.919 --> 06:39.921
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.364
ROSSI: "THE CHARM OF FAME
IS SO GREAT

06:48.408 --> 06:51.280
"THAT WE LIKE EVERY OBJECT
ATTACHED TO IT,

06:51.323 --> 06:53.108
EVEN DEATH."

06:53.151 --> 06:56.154
BLAISE PASCAL.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.722
WE RAN SOME DNA,
AND THE TESTS CONFIRM

06:58.766 --> 07:00.811
THAT WE HAVE THE PRESENCE
OF NOT ONE,

07:00.855 --> 07:02.900
BUT TWO MALE VICTIMS.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.249
ANY IDENTIFICATION?

07:04.293 --> 07:05.599
NO. NOT YET.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.514
UNFORTUNATELY,
NO HITS ON CODIS

07:07.557 --> 07:09.820
OR THE NATIONAL MISSING
PERSONS DATABASE.

07:09.864 --> 07:11.866
SO HE LITERALLY SPLIT
THESE TWO GUYS

07:11.909 --> 07:13.171
RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE,

07:13.215 --> 07:15.391
BUT NOT BEFORE
TORTURING THEM.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.480
THESE ARE INCISED
WOUNDS, CORRECT?

07:17.524 --> 07:19.743
YES. AND WHILE
THE DISARTICULATION

07:19.787 --> 07:21.745
TOOK PLACE POST-MORTEM,

07:21.789 --> 07:24.139
THOSE INJURIES THAT YOU
SEE ARE PERI-MORTEM.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.750
BUT IF HE TORTURED THEM
WHILE THEY WERE
STILL ALIVE,

07:26.794 --> 07:28.535
WERE ARE
THE LIGATURE MARKS?

07:28.578 --> 07:31.451
THERE DON'T APPEAR TO BE
ANY DEFENSIVE WOUNDS, EITHER.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.845
HE'S PARALYZING THEM.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.847
I THINK YOU
MIGHT BE RIGHT.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.719
I'D ORDER AN EXTENDED
TOXICOLOGY PANEL.

07:38.762 --> 07:41.025
IT AIN'T EASY TO
CUT UP A BODY.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.419
NO, IT IS NOT.
AND IN MY OPINION,

07:43.463 --> 07:45.726
A FAIRLY HIGH DEGREE
OF SKILL WAS EMPLOYED

07:45.769 --> 07:48.903
TO DECAPITATE
AND DISARTICULATE
THESE TWO MEN.

07:48.946 --> 07:50.731
BETWEEN THAT AND THE USE
OF A PARALYTIC,

07:50.774 --> 07:53.777
I'D SAY OUR UNSUB HAS
HAD SIGNIFICANT
MEDICAL TRAINING.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.998
YEAH. PLUS ALL THE SLICE
AND DICE IS PERSONAL.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.608
HE KNOWS THESE GUYS,

07:58.652 --> 08:00.218
MAYBE EVEN BETTER
THAN THE WOMEN.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.656
THAT MIGHT START TO
EXPLAIN HIS MIXED MOTIVATIONS,

08:02.699 --> 08:05.049
HIS CHOICE TO MURDER
THE MEN PHYSICALLY,

08:05.093 --> 08:07.182
BUT ASSAULT THE WOMEN
PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

08:07.225 --> 08:10.838
AND RIGHT NOW THE WOMEN
MAY BE OUR ONLY WAY
TO TRACK HIM DOWN.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.841
I'M JUST AFRAID
TO GO HOME NOW.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.930
I CALLED MY MOM
TO PICK UP MY DOG.

08:15.973 --> 08:17.497
SHE SAID WE COULD
STAY WITH HER,

08:17.540 --> 08:18.759
BUT I WISH WE COULD
ALL STAY HERE.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.021
IT'S A GOVERNMENT BUILDING.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.283
THEY'LL DO WHATEVER
THEY CAN TO PROTECT IT.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.546
MS. RAPTIS, THE POLICE
SAID THAT YOU HAD NEVER

08:23.590 --> 08:25.417
RECEIVED ANY PERSONAL
THREATS. IS THAT RIGHT?

08:25.461 --> 08:28.246
IT IS. AND I'VE NEVER
HAD TO FILE ANY KIND
OF A RESTRAINING ORDER.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.639
ARE YOU SEEING
ANYBODY RIGHT NOW?

08:29.683 --> 08:30.684
NO.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.512
WHAT ABOUT ANYONE
WHO MAY HAVE

08:32.555 --> 08:34.557
MADE THREATS AGAINST
THE OFFICE AS A WHOLE?

08:34.601 --> 08:36.167
WELL, THAT COMES
WITH THE TERRITORY,

08:36.211 --> 08:38.256
BECAUSE WHO DOESN'T
HATE THE IRS?

08:38.300 --> 08:40.128
YOU RECOGNIZE ANY
OF THESE WOMEN?

08:40.171 --> 08:41.521
DID THEY GET BOXES, TOO?

08:41.564 --> 08:43.218
YES.

08:43.261 --> 08:46.743
NO. SORRY,
I DON'T KNOW THEM.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.353
I REALLY WISH I COULD
HELP YOU MORE.

08:48.397 --> 08:50.704
WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.227
ALVEZ: THANKS.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.100
SO GARCIA'S GOT
A LIST OF THREATS

08:56.144 --> 08:58.102
THAT WERE MADE
TO THE IRS OVER
THE LAST YEAR,

08:58.146 --> 09:00.017
BUT HONESTLY, I DON'T
THINK WE'RE GONNA FIND
ANYTHING THERE.

09:00.061 --> 09:01.715
YEAH, I AGREE.

09:01.758 --> 09:04.456
'CAUSE WHY WOULD SOMEONE
WITH A GRUDGE AGAINST THE IRS

09:04.500 --> 09:06.894
ALSO GO AFTER SOMEONE
LIKE A TEACHER
OR REAL ESTATE AGENT?

09:06.937 --> 09:08.896
BUT WHAT I DID
FIND INTERESTING

09:08.939 --> 09:11.594
IS THAT OUR INTERVIEWS
WITH ALL THE FEMALE VICTIMS

09:11.638 --> 09:13.291
HAVE GONE THE SAME WAY.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.380
YEAH, THEY'RE
ALL BAFFLED BY
BEING TARGETED.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.993
IT JUST DOESN'T
LEAVE US WITH
THE USUAL SUSPECTS

09:19.036 --> 09:19.907
TO TRACK DOWN.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.256
YEAH.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.999
MAN, I MUST BE
LOSING IT.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.870
WHY

09:26.914 --> 09:30.004
WELL, I'M OVER HERE
LOOKING AT JUST HOW WELL

09:30.047 --> 09:31.832
OUR UNSUB WRAPPED
THESE BOXES

09:31.875 --> 09:34.878
BECAUSE CLEARLY HE
DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING
SPOILING HIS SURPRISE,

09:34.922 --> 09:36.837
AND AT THE SAME TIME,
I CAN'T HELP
ASKING MYSELF

09:36.880 --> 09:39.753
WHY I NEVER LEARNED
HOW TO GIFT WRAP
PRESENTS FOR MY FAMILY.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.668
YOU COULD ALWAYS HIRE
SOMEONE TO DO IT FOR YOU.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.453
I DO, BUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S NOT THE SAME.

09:44.496 --> 09:46.455
ANYWAY, CLEARLY THIS
GUY HAS MAJOR SKILLS.

09:46.498 --> 09:49.371
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
HE WOULD HAVE NEEDED
DIRECT ACCESS

09:49.414 --> 09:50.851
TO WORLD SEND'S
TRACKING SYSTEM,

09:50.894 --> 09:54.028
ALONG WITH A BRANCH
OFFICE FOR HIS BOXES
TO BE PICKED UP.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.595
SO YOU THINK HE'S
EITHER A CURRENT

09:55.638 --> 09:57.161
OR FORMER EMPLOYEE
OF WORLD SEND?

09:57.205 --> 09:59.250
WELL, WHO BETTER THAN
A DISGRUNTLED COURIER

09:59.294 --> 10:01.818
TO CALL HIMSELF,
MOCKINGLY OR NOT,
"GONE POSTAL."

10:01.862 --> 10:03.820
TRUE. BUT IS THIS
DISGRUNTLED COURIER

10:03.864 --> 10:05.517
ALSO A FRUSTRATED DOCTOR?

10:05.561 --> 10:06.954
I'LL TELL YOU WHY
HE'D BE FRUSTRATED,

10:06.997 --> 10:08.695
BECAUSE HE DROPPED OUT,
FAILED OUT,

10:08.738 --> 10:10.261
OR GOT BOOTED OUT
OF MEDICAL SCHOOL.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.915
I CAN DEFINITELY SEE THAT,
BUT WHAT PUZZLES ME

10:11.959 --> 10:13.438
IS THE IDEA THAT ONCE
OUT OF SCHOOL,

10:13.482 --> 10:15.615
HE'D CHOOSE TO GET
A REGULAR 9:00 TO 5:00 JOB.

10:15.658 --> 10:18.269
THESE LINGUISTICS EXPRESS
AN UNCONSCIOUS PREOCCUPATION

10:18.313 --> 10:20.271
WITH MATERIALISM
AND SELF-AGGRANDIZEMENT.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.664
THEY ESSENTIALLY
ARTICULATE THE RAGE

10:21.708 --> 10:22.926
OF A PURE
MALIGNANT NARCISSIST.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.885
I GOT SOMETHING.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.887
ACCORDING TO WORLD SEND,
IN ORDER FOR THOSE BOXES

10:26.930 --> 10:29.672
TO BE DELIVERED, THEY HAD
TO BE ENTERED INTO
THE COMPANY COMPUTER SYSTEM

10:29.716 --> 10:31.282
USING AN EMPLOYEE
I.D. ACCESS CODE.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.806
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
WE WERE THINKING.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.243
RIGHT. SO IN THIS CASE,
ALL 6 PACKAGES WERE TAGGED

10:35.286 --> 10:37.332
WITH THE CODE ASSIGNED
TO DUANE VANN.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.942
AND HE'S THE MANAGER
IN CHARGE AT THE BRANCH

10:38.986 --> 10:40.204
THAT WAS CLOSED
FOR REMODELING.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.249
DO WE HAVE
A HOME ADDRESS?

10:41.292 --> 10:42.424
YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.556
ALL RIGHT, I'LL
COORDINATE WITH SWAT.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.387
GARCIA: OH, MY GOD.
YOU GUYS. GUYS!

10:49.431 --> 10:50.954
GUYS, THIS IS--
THIS IS HAPPENING.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.042
SIMMONS: ALL RIGHT,
SLOW DOWN. WHAT'S HAPPENING?

10:52.086 --> 10:53.914
I FOUND GONE POSTAL ONLINE,

10:53.957 --> 10:55.524
AND HE'S LIVE-STREAMING
A MURDER.

10:55.567 --> 10:56.743
WHAT SOCIAL NETWORK
IS THIS?

10:56.786 --> 10:58.005
IT'S NOT A CONVENTIONAL
NETWORK.

10:58.048 --> 11:00.224
I PUT OUT A DIGITAL
MARKER FOR "GONE POSTAL,"

11:00.268 --> 11:04.185
AND I FOUND IT ON
A WEBSITE CALLED
XXXANADU.XTZ.CU.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.666
XTZ.CU?
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

11:06.709 --> 11:08.363
IT'S A LOWER
LEVEL DOMAIN.
IT'S THE DARK NET.

11:08.406 --> 11:09.973
IS THERE ANY WAY TO
LOCATE WHERE THIS
LIVE

11:10.017 --> 11:11.932
I'M RUNNING
A DIGITAL TRACE NOW.

11:11.975 --> 11:14.282
UH, IT'S WITH
THE I.P. ADDRESS.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.501
OK, ACCORDING TO
THE I.P. ADDRESS,

11:16.545 --> 11:18.547
THE COMPUTER'S ON
A WI-FI NETWORK

11:18.590 --> 11:21.681
SOMEWHERE AROUND
THE 1400 BLOCK

11:21.724 --> 11:23.117
OF WESTERFALL
SPRINGS AVENUE.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.118
OUR SUSPECT
DUANE VANN'S ADDRESS

11:24.161 --> 11:26.381
IS 1457 WESTERFALL
SPRINGS AVENUE.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.164
SWAT'S ALREADY ON ITS WAY.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.079
OK.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.388
CLEAR.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.020
SIMMONS: THIS VIDEO STREAM
ISN'T GOING OUT LIVE.

12:40.063 --> 12:42.196
IT'S ON A CONTINUOUS LOOP.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.111
WHO KNOWS WHEN
IT WAS RECORDED.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.286
SON OF A BITCH
PLAYED US.

12:45.329 --> 12:46.678
HE DID.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.245
BUT SOMEWHERE OUT
THERE IS ANOTHER
MALE VICTIM

12:48.289 --> 12:50.508
AND WHO KNOWS HOW
MANY OTHER WOMEN
WHO ARE ABOUT

12:50.552 --> 12:53.381
TO GET A TERRIBLE
SURPRISE.

12:55.078 --> 12:56.384
MAN ON RADIO:
I'M SORRY, NANCY.

12:56.427 --> 12:58.995
DID YOU JUST SAY
SOMEONE LIVE-STREAMED
A MURDER?

12:59.039 --> 13:00.170
WOMAN ON RADIO:
YES, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE HEARING

13:00.214 --> 13:02.259
FROM A SOURCE CLOSE
TO THE INVESTIGATION.

13:02.303 --> 13:04.087
AND JUST MOMENTS AGO,

13:04.131 --> 13:06.350
AN FBI SPOKESPERSON
ISSUED A STATEMENT

13:06.394 --> 13:09.179
WARNING WOMEN LIVING IN
THE WASHINGTON D.C. AREA

13:09.223 --> 13:11.094
TO AVOID OPENING ANY
SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE

13:11.138 --> 13:14.054
THEY MIGHT RECEIVE
AT HOME OR AT WORK.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.841
♪ I'M CRAZY AND I'M HURT

13:20.277 --> 13:22.279
♪ HEAD ON MY SHOULDERS

13:28.546 --> 13:29.721
PRENTISS: THIS MORNING
MORE BODY PARTS

13:29.765 --> 13:31.593
WERE DELIVERED
TO 4 MORE WOMEN,

13:31.636 --> 13:35.379
AND THIS TIME EVEN THOUGH
HE DIDN'T SEND ANY
HANDWRITTEN MESSAGES,

13:35.423 --> 13:37.817
OUR UNSUB WASN'T SHY ABOUT
INCLUDING EVERYTHING ELSE,

13:37.860 --> 13:39.514
INCLUDING THE MALE
VICTIM'S HEAD.

13:39.557 --> 13:44.084
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO IDENTIFY AS
DR. NICOLAS KAUFFMANN.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.390
HE'S A PROMINENT
D.C. PSYCHIATRIST.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.175
ALVEZ: METRO POLICE
ARE AT HIS HOUSE NOW.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.830
THEY SAY THERE ARE
DEFINITE SIGNS OF
FORCED ENTRY,

13:50.873 --> 13:52.570
BUT NO SIGNS OF ANY
VIOLENCE ANYWHERE
IN THE HOUSE.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.355
AND THE UNSUB APPARENTLY
MADE HIS GETAWAY

13:54.398 --> 13:56.139
IN DR. KAUFFMANN'S
RANGE ROVER.

13:56.183 --> 13:57.532
WE'VE GOT A BOLO
OUT ON IT.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.403
WE'RE ALSO IN THE
PROCESS OF ACCESSING

13:59.447 --> 14:02.493
ALL OF HIS PATIENT
RECORDS FROM
THE LAST 16 YEARS.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.582
NOW, THERE WERE
NO COURIER LABELS
ON THESE BOXES,

14:04.626 --> 14:06.584
SO IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
HE DELIVERED THEM HIMSELF.

14:06.628 --> 14:09.457
THE ONE INDEX CARD HE DID
LEAVE BEHIND HERE READS,

14:09.500 --> 14:12.242
"MADE YOU LOOK, BITCHES.
I REMAIN. GP."

14:12.286 --> 14:13.635
YOU KNOW, I'D SAY
THAT EXPLICIT SHIFT

14:13.678 --> 14:15.767
IN THE REFERENTIAL
DESIGNATION OF THAT
WORD "BITCH"

14:15.811 --> 14:18.596
FROM THE FIRST MALE
VICTIM TO NOW MEMBERS
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

14:18.640 --> 14:20.033
COULD ACTUALLY BE
SIGNALING THE START

14:20.076 --> 14:21.382
OF A SUBLIMATION
OF MOTIVES.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.775
JJ: MEANING YOU THINK
THAT THIS SPECTACLE

14:23.819 --> 14:26.387
OF TAUNTING THE POLICE
MIGHT BECOME MORE
IMPORTANT TO HIM

14:26.430 --> 14:28.563
THAN HIS ACTUAL
CHOICE OF VICTIM?

14:28.606 --> 14:31.044
REID: I DO. AND I DON'T
THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT
TAUNTING THE POLICE.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.654
I THINK IT'S ALSO ABOUT
THE UNSUB'S NEED TO CAPTURE

14:32.697 --> 14:34.090
THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.439
PRENTISS: HAS THE M.E.
IDENTIFIED YOUR VICTIMS?

14:35.483 --> 14:38.573
YES. THEY WERE DUANE VANN
AND RORY STEVENSON.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.531
THEY WERE MARRIED
ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO.

14:40.575 --> 14:43.317
FORENSICS IS TELLING US
THAT THE SCENE HERE
HAS BEEN TOTALLY STAGED.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.493
THEY WEREN'T KILLED
IN THE HOUSE?

14:45.536 --> 14:47.408
NO, NEITHER KILLED
NOR DISMEMBERED,

14:47.451 --> 14:48.888
AND THERE'S NO SIGN
OF FORCED ENTRY,

14:48.931 --> 14:51.673
WHICH MEANS THAT RORY
AND DUANE MUST HAVE
LET HIM IN.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.980
LIKE ROSSI SAID,
HE PROBABLY KNEW THEM WELL,

14:54.023 --> 14:55.764
AND THEN HE USED
THE PARALYTIC TO
DISABLE THEM.

14:55.807 --> 15:00.595
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO IDENTIFY
AS ROCURONIUM BROMIDE.

15:00.638 --> 15:03.076
IT'S A NEUROMUSCULAR
BLOCKER TYPICALLY
USED IN ANESTHESIA.

15:03.119 --> 15:05.817
I THINK THAT FACT LOCKS
DOWN THIS GUY'S
MEDICAL BACKGROUND,

15:05.861 --> 15:07.602
BUT WHERE'S THIS GUY'S
OPERATING THEATER?

15:07.645 --> 15:09.430
ROSSI: RIGHT. THE VANN
AND KAUFFMANN HOMES

15:09.473 --> 15:11.432
ARE ONLY THE SECONDARY
CRIME SCENES.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.173
WE STILL NEED TO FIND
THE PRIMARY.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.610
SO WE NEED TO TAKE
A CLOSER LOOK AT
THE VIDEO HE POSTED

15:15.653 --> 15:17.394
OF DR. KAUFFMANN'S
MURDER ONLINE.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.353
YEAH. WE SHOULD ALSO
SEE WHAT ELSE GARCIA'S

15:19.396 --> 15:21.398
BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT
ABOUT THE WEBSITE
THAT HE USED.

15:21.442 --> 15:24.358
ITS HISTORY COULD HELP US
NAIL DOWN THE PROFILE.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.751
HELLO, GARCIA.

15:26.795 --> 15:31.060
WOULD YOU MIND MAKING
ME A COPY OF THE
DR. KAUFFMANN VIDEO?

15:31.104 --> 15:34.455
UNFORTUNATELY,
SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE
A GOOD LOOK AT IT

15:34.498 --> 15:37.675
TO MAKE SURE THERE ISN'T
ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY
PROBATIVE ON IT.

15:37.719 --> 15:39.416
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.

15:39.460 --> 15:43.507
YEAH. I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO WATCH A SNUFF
FILM AGAIN, BUT I--

15:43.551 --> 15:45.161
NO, I ALREADY WATCHED IT.

15:45.205 --> 15:46.902
THERE'S NOTHING
DISTINGUISHING
ABOUT THE ROOM.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.773
IT'S TOO DARK.
ONLY THINGS YOU CAN SEE

15:48.817 --> 15:51.559
IS WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY
CONFIRMED ABOUT HIS METHOD
OF OPERATING.

15:51.602 --> 15:54.475
THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD.
THERE'S A LOT OF SCREAMING.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.999
HOW MANY TIMES
DID YOU WATCH IT?

15:57.043 --> 16:00.350
MORE THAN ENOUGH TIMES.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.005
ARE YOU OK?

16:03.049 --> 16:04.746
YOU NEVER REALLY
LOOK AT--

16:04.789 --> 16:07.444
OH, NO ONE HAS TIMES
FOR MY SENSITIVITIES.

16:07.488 --> 16:10.143
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT
I COULD STAND TO HAVE
SOME EMOTIONAL CALLUSES.

16:10.186 --> 16:14.321
I DID FIND SOMETHING
PROBABLY PROBATIVE IN
MY RESEARCH

16:14.364 --> 16:16.540
OF A WEBSITE HE USED--

16:16.584 --> 16:19.587
XXXANADU.XTZ.CU.

16:19.630 --> 16:22.633
IT IS A PORTAL THAT IS
NO STRANGER TO THE PROFANE,

16:22.677 --> 16:26.376
PERVERSE,
AND PUKE-INDUCING.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.770
DARK NET BE DAMNED,
I FOUND THE WEBMASTER.

16:28.813 --> 16:31.512
HER NAME'S GALINA KADLEC.
SHE ALSO OWNS THE SITE.

16:31.555 --> 16:33.383
AND IT WASN'T LIKE I WAS--
WHAT?!--SURPRISED

16:33.427 --> 16:35.603
TO FIND OUT SHE'S BEEN
ARRESTED MORE THAN ONCE

16:35.646 --> 16:39.868
BECAUSE WHAT SHE ENCOURAGES
TO BE ENJOYED ON THIS SITE.

16:39.911 --> 16:43.611
THERE IS SOMETHING VERY
UPSIDE DOWN ABOUT THAT WOMAN.

16:43.654 --> 16:47.528
ALL RIGHT, I'LL HAVE
THE FEDERAL MARSHALS
GO AND PICK HER UP.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.706
GREAT JOB.

16:51.749 --> 16:53.838
DUE TO THE ORGANIZED
AND STRENUOUS NATURE

16:53.882 --> 16:55.101
OF THE MODUS OPERANDI,

16:55.144 --> 16:57.451
WE BELIEVE OUR UNKNOWN
SUBJECT IS A MALE

16:57.494 --> 16:59.540
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HIS
MID-TWENTIES AND THIRTIES.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.063
SIMMONS: HE'S DEMONSTRATED
SURGICAL SKILLS

17:01.107 --> 17:03.065
THAT SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT OF MEDICAL TRAINING

17:03.109 --> 17:05.111
AS WELL AS PROFICIENCY
WITH COMPUTERS

17:05.154 --> 17:07.461
INDICATIVE OF A
GRADUATE EDUCATION.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.724
JJ: ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT
YET CLEAR HOW HE'S SELECTING

17:09.767 --> 17:11.508
EITHER HIS MALE
OR FEMALE VICTIMS,

17:11.552 --> 17:14.381
THE VIOLENCE AND
PSYCHOLOGICAL SADISM

17:14.424 --> 17:16.557
SUGGESTS THAT HE DOES HAVE
SOME KIND OF AFFILIATION

17:16.600 --> 17:17.732
WITH ALL OF THEM.

17:17.775 --> 17:18.994
REID: WE BELIEVE OUR
UNSUB IS BEING DRIVEN

17:19.038 --> 17:20.213
BY MIXED MOTIVATIONS.

17:20.256 --> 17:21.866
AND BECAUSE OF HIS
PARTICULAR M.O.

17:21.910 --> 17:24.434
WITH THE MALE VICTIMS,
COUPLED WITH THE LINGUISTICS

17:24.478 --> 17:25.696
HE'S USED IN HIS
MESSAGES TO US,

17:25.740 --> 17:28.221
IT APPEARS LIKELY
THAT ONE MOTIVATION

17:28.264 --> 17:30.745
MAY BE DEEPLY ROOTED IN
A NEED FOR RETRIBUTION.

17:30.788 --> 17:33.095
PRENTISS: WHETHER IT
IS REAL OR IMAGINED,

17:33.139 --> 17:35.663
THIS UNSUB BELIEVES THAT
THE MEN HE'S TARGETING

17:35.706 --> 17:37.578
HAVE HARMED HIM,
EITHER PHYSICALLY

17:37.621 --> 17:39.536
OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY,
MAYBE BOTH.

17:39.580 --> 17:43.975
SO THEIR PAIN
AND SUFFERING AND DEATH
ARE JUSTIFIED TO HIM.

17:44.019 --> 17:47.196
OF COURSE, THIS IS NOT
UNCOMMON, ESPECIALLY
FOR ANGRY YOUNG MEN.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.633
JJ: OUR UNSUB IS
CRAVING VALIDATION

17:49.677 --> 17:51.461
THROUGH A SENSE OF
SUPERIORITY.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.463
AND IF THROUGH NOTHING ELSE,

17:53.507 --> 17:55.726
SUPERIORITY THROUGH
FEAR ITSELF.

17:55.770 --> 17:57.728
AND SO HE WILL CONTINUE
TO TRY TO REACH OUT

17:57.772 --> 17:59.295
TO ANY AND ALL
SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS

17:59.339 --> 18:01.906
THAT MIGHT PROVIDE HIM
WITH A PLATFORM.

18:01.950 --> 18:04.344
THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE NOW
SINCE WE HAVE SEIZED CONTROL

18:04.387 --> 18:05.823
OF THE WEBSITE TO WHICH
HE UPLOADED HIS VIDEO.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.912
REID: BUT ALSO BECAUSE
HIS ULTIMATE VALIDATION

18:07.956 --> 18:09.218
WILL COME THROUGH FAME,

18:09.262 --> 18:11.394
THE CROWNING OF CELEBRITY
OFFERS OUR UNSUB

18:11.438 --> 18:13.440
A SENSE OF DOMINANCE
OVER OTHERS THAT

18:13.483 --> 18:16.312
QUITE POSSIBLY SATISFIES
ALL OF HIS MOTIVATIONS.

18:16.356 --> 18:19.489
SO AS HIS PSYCHE FEEDS OFF
THE FRENZY HE'S CREATING,

18:19.533 --> 18:22.362
LIKE A SPREE KILLER,
HE WILL STOP AT NOTHING

18:22.405 --> 18:25.800
TO BURN AS BRIGHTLY
AS HE CAN FOR AS LONG
AS HE CAN.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.673
♪ I'M ABOUT TO HAVE
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN ♪

18:29.717 --> 18:32.198
♪ MY HEAD REALLY HURTS

18:32.241 --> 18:35.070
♪ IF I DON'T FIND
A WAY OUT OF HERE ♪

18:35.114 --> 18:36.811
♪ I'M GONNA GO...

18:38.247 --> 18:40.031
♪ I'M CRAZY AND I'M HURT

18:42.033 --> 18:45.254
SO GALINA KADLEC
IS NO STRANGER

18:45.298 --> 18:47.517
TO PLAYING IT
FAST AND LOOSE
WITH THE LAW.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.650
SHE WAS ONCE A SO-CALLED
PERFORMANCE ARTIST

18:49.693 --> 18:51.608
WHOSE ART WAS OFTEN
CHARGED WITH VIOLATING

18:51.652 --> 18:53.480
FEDERAL AND STATE
OBSCENITY LAWS.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.612
ALTHOUGH SHE WAS
NEVER CONVICTED.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.658
IT ALSO SAYS HERE
SHE WAS ONCE THE OWNER
OF A COMPANY

18:57.701 --> 19:02.010
CALLED FAU-TYPE WHICH
PRODUCED AND DISTRIBUTED
ADULT ENTERTAINMENT.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.620
IF BY "ADULT
ENTERTAINMENT,"

19:03.664 --> 19:05.535
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
FETISHES LIKE

19:05.579 --> 19:08.321
VORAREPHILIA
AND BESTIALITY.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.584
OK, I GET IT.
SHE'S GOT EXOTIC TASTES.

19:10.627 --> 19:13.500
IT SAYS SHE LOST
HER COMPANY IN A DIVORCE.

19:13.543 --> 19:17.068
SHE'S BEEN LOOKING TO GET
HER FIX WITH SOME FREAKS
ON THE DARK WEB.

19:17.112 --> 19:18.766
YEAH, BUT THE QUESTION
FOR US RIGHT NOW IS,

19:18.809 --> 19:22.639
WHY DID OUR UNSUB CHOOSE
TO POST HIS SNUFF FILM
TO HER WEBSITE?

19:22.683 --> 19:25.033
IS IT JUST A COINCIDENCE
OR DO THEY HAVE
A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP?

19:25.076 --> 19:27.340
AND IF THEY DO, IS HE
REACHING OUT TO HER

19:27.383 --> 19:28.863
OR IS SHE EGGING HIM ON?

19:28.906 --> 19:31.822
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GO IN THERE AND FIND OUT?

19:39.047 --> 19:40.396
I CONFESS.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.224
MY FATAL FLOW IS NAIVETE.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.661
MS. KADLEC, LET'S
NOT SCREW AROUND.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.405
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT,

19:49.449 --> 19:50.885
BUT YOU KNOW THAT.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.713
THIS IS ABOUT A SERIES
OF HOMICIDES,

19:52.756 --> 19:55.019
AND SINCE YOUR SITE
STREAMED ONE OF
THOSE MURDERS,

19:55.063 --> 19:57.108
THIS IS ALSO ABOUT
AIDING AND ABETTING

19:57.152 --> 19:59.850
AND POSSIBLY CONSPIRACY
BEFORE OR AFTER THE FACT.

19:59.894 --> 20:03.854
OH, I ADORE THE
TAG-TEAM DOMINANCE.

20:03.898 --> 20:06.683
BUT YOU DO MISTAKE ME
FOR A SUBMISSIVE.

20:06.727 --> 20:09.860
WE ALSO FORGOT
AN OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE CHARGE.

20:11.819 --> 20:14.909
YOU KNOW WHO THIS GUY IS.
TELL US.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.258
NOW.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.129
KADLEC: NO.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.741
BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW HIM.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.351
I DO NOT HAVE ANY
DIRECT KNOWLEDGE

20:22.395 --> 20:24.962
OF ANYONE WHO CHOOSES
TO USE MY WEBSITE.

20:25.006 --> 20:27.791
IT IS ANONYMOUS.
IT HAS TO BE,

20:27.835 --> 20:30.098
OR ELSE IT WOULD
SUBVERT ITS PURPOSE.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.274
WHAT PURPOSE, PERVERSION?

20:32.318 --> 20:33.797
ONE AND THE SAME.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.452
IT IS RULE 34.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.715
I'M SORRY, COME AGAIN?

20:38.759 --> 20:39.847
RULE 34.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.850
IF IT EXISTS, THERE'S
PORNOGRAPHY OF IT.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.765
NO EXCEPTIONS.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.288
THE XXXANADU WEBSITE
WAS CREATED

20:46.332 --> 20:49.291
FOR PEOPLE TO SHARE
THEIR MOST FORBIDDEN
SEXUAL FANTASIES,

20:49.335 --> 20:50.988
NO NAMES, NO SHAMES.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.252
LEWIS: WOW.
NO SHAME, HUH?

20:53.295 --> 20:55.428
EVEN THOUGH YOU LET
PEOPLE WATCH A VIDEO

20:55.471 --> 20:57.517
OF A MAN LITERALLY
GETTING HACKED TO PIECES.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.781
SO YOU'RE TRYING
TO TELL US ALL YOU AND
YOUR DEGENERATE USERS

21:00.824 --> 21:04.045
WERE DOING WAS--
WAS GETTING OFF?

21:04.088 --> 21:05.960
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

21:06.003 --> 21:09.311
AND EVEN IF I ACCEPT
THAT IT WAS NOT FAKED,

21:09.355 --> 21:11.095
THIS VIDEO IS
NO DIFFERENT THAN

21:11.139 --> 21:12.749
ANY OTHER VIDEO
YOU CAN SEE ON YOUTUBE,

21:12.793 --> 21:14.490
THAT WAS RECORDED
IN A WAR ZONE,

21:14.534 --> 21:17.014
BUT IT GETS A PASS
BECAUSE IT'S
CONSIDERED NEWS.

21:17.058 --> 21:20.931
OK. MS. KADLEC,
IF YOU THINK THAT
YOU CAN DEFLECT

21:20.975 --> 21:25.109
BY SASHAYING YOUR DEPRAVITY,
YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.721
OH, I THINK YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO'S MISTAKEN.

21:27.764 --> 21:31.377
WHAT YOU PERCEIVE
AS MY CALLOUSNESS

21:31.420 --> 21:35.337
IS, TO BE FAIR,
MY REVERENCE FOR
THE CYCLE OF LIFE.

21:35.381 --> 21:36.947
SIMMONS:
OK, WHATEVER.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.821
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE AGENTS
DIGGING UP YOUR REAL

21:40.864 --> 21:42.344
AND YOUR DIGITAL LIFE.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.607
I CAN PROMISE YOU
THAT WE'LL FIND
THE CONNECTION

21:44.651 --> 21:47.001
BETWEEN YOU
AND THIS PSYCHOPATH.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.351
WELL, I WOULD ADVISE YOU,
BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE,

21:49.395 --> 21:54.182
TO NEVER MAKE A PROMISE
THAT YOU'RE NOT ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN YOU CAN KEEP,

21:54.225 --> 21:58.969
BECAUSE KARMA
CAN BE A BITCH.

22:25.996 --> 22:27.389
WOMAN: HELLO?

22:27.433 --> 22:28.956
IT'S ME, MOM.

22:28.999 --> 22:31.219
OH, SWEETHEART.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.786
WHERE ARE YOU?

22:32.829 --> 22:34.353
UM...

22:36.050 --> 22:37.443
I'M AT A FRIEND'S.

22:37.486 --> 22:39.183
BUT YOU TOLD ME YOU
WERE GETTING OUT

22:39.227 --> 22:40.837
AND THEN COMING
STRAIGHT HOME.

22:40.881 --> 22:43.449
I WAS STARTING
TO GET WORRIED.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.407
HAVE YOU BEEN
WATCHING THE NEWS?

22:45.451 --> 22:49.455
YEAH. MOM, I'M OK.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.544
I'M GREAT, ACTUALLY.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.328
GOOD.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.504
WHEN SHOULD I EXPECT YOU?

22:57.941 --> 23:00.335
EMMANUEL?

23:00.379 --> 23:03.425
MOM, I CAN'T COME HOME.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.035
WHY?

23:05.079 --> 23:06.602
SOMETHING'S COME UP,

23:06.646 --> 23:09.083
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

23:09.126 --> 23:12.478
NOW, I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.218
IT'S A SURPRISE.

23:16.003 --> 23:19.354
BUT WHEN IT'S ALL OVER,

23:19.398 --> 23:22.401
EVERYONE'S GOING TO
REMEMBER YOUR SON'S NAME.

23:22.444 --> 23:25.404
HONEY, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
JUST COME HOME.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.623
YOU'VE BEEN AWAY
FOR SO LONG.

23:28.929 --> 23:33.803
I FINALLY MADE
SOMETHING OF MYSELF.

23:33.847 --> 23:34.804
GOOD-BYE, MOM.

23:34.848 --> 23:36.502
WAIT.

23:36.545 --> 23:37.720
EMMAN--

23:42.029 --> 23:44.466
DISPATCHER: AVAILABLE UNITS,
THE CROSS STREET IS GALATIN

23:44.510 --> 23:46.033
AND HARPER BOULEVARD.

23:46.076 --> 23:48.122
ANY AVAILABLE UNITS.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.912
HEY. HEY, BABY.

23:55.956 --> 23:59.350
I'M SORRY, I'M GONNA BE
HOME LATE AGAIN TONIGHT.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.831
YEAH, I FIGURED AS MUCH.

24:01.875 --> 24:04.573
I JUST HAD TO TURN OFF
THE NEWS TONIGHT.

24:04.617 --> 24:07.750
SO HOW'S IT GOING?
HOW'S, UM, HOW'S DAVID?

24:07.794 --> 24:10.231
HE'S GOOD. WE'VE HAD
A GOOD COUPLE OF DAYS

24:10.274 --> 24:11.972
HANGING OUT TOGETHER.

24:12.015 --> 24:15.062
UH, HEY,

24:15.105 --> 24:18.326
YOU DIDN'T HEAR WHAT
HAPPENED TO TRINA RYLANCE'S
MOTHER, DID YOU?

24:18.369 --> 24:20.067
WHO'S TRINA RYLANCE?

24:20.110 --> 24:22.330
SHE WAS A CLASSMATE
OF DAVID'S UNTIL
THE START OF THE YEAR.

24:22.373 --> 24:24.158
HE TOLD ME HOW THE KIDS
FOUND HOW THAT HER MOTHER

24:24.201 --> 24:26.203
HAD DIED IN SOME KIND
OF ACCIDENT

24:26.247 --> 24:27.814
AND IT HAD SCARED HIM.

24:27.857 --> 24:29.032
YEAH.

24:29.076 --> 24:31.426
OF COURSE IT WOULD.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.341
WELL, I'M GLAD HE'S
STARTING TO OPEN UP.

24:33.384 --> 24:36.823
LOOK, I'LL TEXT YOU
WHEN I'M ON MY WAY
HOME TONIGHT, OK?

24:36.866 --> 24:39.347
THAT'S FINE, BUT
I WILL BE ASLEEP.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.305
HMM. FAIR ENOUGH.

24:41.349 --> 24:44.439
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, SLEEP WELL,
AND I LOVE YOU.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.789
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
STAY SAFE.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.399
I WILL.

24:54.449 --> 24:57.147
D.C. METRO POLICE JUST
FOUND DR. KAUFFMANN'S CAR.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.585
IT WAS PARKED NEAR
14th AND "T" IN
THE CARDOZO AREA.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.064
FORENSICS IS
PROCESSING IT NOW.

25:01.108 --> 25:03.545
ANY OTHER CARS
REPORTED STOLEN IN
THAT AREA TONIGHT?

25:03.589 --> 25:04.807
NONE SO FAR.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.156
WELL, HE'S ON FOOT,
MAYBE BECAUSE

25:06.200 --> 25:07.636
CARDOZO'S WHERE HIS
NEXT VICTIM LIVES.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.812
AND WE JUST FOUND
A CONNECTION

25:09.856 --> 25:11.466
BETWEEN THE MALE VICTIMS.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.946
WENT THROUGH
DR. KAUFFMANN'S
PATIENT RECORDS.

25:12.989 --> 25:15.514
IT TURNS OUT 3 YEARS
AGO A PATIENT WAS
REFERRED TO HIM

25:15.557 --> 25:17.341
BY THE NAME OF
EMMANUEL RASK.

25:17.385 --> 25:18.560
GARCIA: MEANWHILE,
I WAS DOING SOME RESEARCH

25:18.604 --> 25:20.257
ON DUANE VANN'S SOCIAL MEDIA,

25:20.301 --> 25:21.781
AND AROUND 3 YEARS AGO,

25:21.824 --> 25:23.826
HE SEEMED TO HAVE
A PRETTY SERIOUS
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP

25:23.870 --> 25:25.828
WITH THAT VERY SAME
EMMANUEL RASK.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.351
PRENTISS: WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT RASK?

25:27.395 --> 25:28.439
REID: CHILD PRODIGY
IN MUSIC,

25:28.483 --> 25:30.006
VALEDICTORIAN
OF HIS HIGH SCHOOL.

25:30.050 --> 25:31.530
HE WON A SCHOLARSHIP
TO HALLRIDGE UNIVERSITY,

25:31.573 --> 25:34.141
WHERE HE WAS LATER
ACCEPTED TO
THE MEDICAL SCHOOL.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.490
FROM WHICH
HE WAS EXPELLED?

25:35.534 --> 25:37.448
OH, YEAH. FOR BEHAVIOR
DEEMED GROSSLY INAPPROPRIATE

25:37.492 --> 25:39.102
BY THE MEDICAL SCHOOL'S
CODE OF CONDUCT.

25:39.146 --> 25:41.496
THE ADMINISTRATION
DISCOVERED THAT RASK

25:41.540 --> 25:43.454
HAD BEEN MAKING
CRUSH VIDEOS.

25:43.498 --> 25:44.630
WHAT'S A CRUSH VIDEO?

25:44.673 --> 25:46.327
CRUSHING IS A PARAPHILIA
WHERE SOMEONE'S

25:46.370 --> 25:49.678
SEXUAL AROUSED BY
THE CRUSHING OF OBJECTS
WITH A HUMAN BODY.

25:49.722 --> 25:52.551
TYPICALLY IT'S THE FOOT,
AND THE ITEMS
ARE USUALLY FOOD,

25:52.594 --> 25:56.119
BUT IN RASK'S CASE,
THEY WERE SMALL ANIMALS.

25:56.163 --> 25:58.861
WAS HE CHARGED WITH
ANIMAL CRUELTY?

25:58.905 --> 26:00.471
NO. THEY DIDN'T HAVE
A CHANCE TO DO THAT

26:00.515 --> 26:03.126
BECAUSE RASK WENT AFTER
THE STUDENT HE THOUGHT
DIMED HIM OUT.

26:03.170 --> 26:05.433
HE WAS CONVICTED OF
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.478
HE WAS SENTENCED TO
6 YEARS IN PRISON.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.437
HE WAS SERVED TWO,
GOOD BEHAVIOR.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.613
AND HE WAS RELEASED
ON PROBATION 4 DAYS AGO.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.093
DOES HE HAVE ANY
FAMILY IN THE AREA?

26:13.136 --> 26:15.008
HIS FATHER ALONSO
COMMITTED SUICIDE
10 YEARS AGO,

26:15.051 --> 26:17.401
BUT HIS MOTHER JANEL
CURRENTLY LIVES IN
HILLCREST HEIGHTS.

26:17.445 --> 26:19.447
LUKE AND I CAN GO
TALK TO HER.

26:19.490 --> 26:21.884
DR. KAUFFMANN NOTED
HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS

26:21.928 --> 26:24.104
FOR HIM DIAGNOSE RASK
BECAUSE HE EXHIBITED

26:24.147 --> 26:25.584
ALL THE ATTENTION-SEEKING
TENDENCIES

26:25.627 --> 26:27.237
OF A HISTRIONIC
PERSONALITY

26:27.281 --> 26:29.500
WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY
FLAUNTING AN EXAGGERATED
SENSE OF SELF WORTH

26:29.544 --> 26:31.067
CONSISTENT WITH BEING
A NARCISSIST.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.765
WELL, THOSE TWO
PERSONALITY TYPES

26:32.808 --> 26:34.636
ARE USUALLY INCONSISTENT
WITH EACH OTHER,

26:34.680 --> 26:36.812
WHICH MEANS HE'S BEEN
STRUGGLING WITH THESE
MIXED MOTIVATIONS

26:36.856 --> 26:38.640
FOR A LONG TIME.

26:38.684 --> 26:41.338
AND IF HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH DUANE VANN

26:41.382 --> 26:43.297
WAS AS IMPORTANT TO HIM
AS I THINK IT WAS,

26:43.340 --> 26:46.126
THEN LEARNING THAT VANN
GOT MARRIED WHILE HE
WAS IN PRISON

26:46.169 --> 26:47.606
COULD HAVE TRIGGED HIS RAGE.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.520
SO RASK HAD TO
HAVE BEEN PLANNING
THIS FOR A WHILE NOW.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.348
AND HE KNEW HE'D
NEED SOME HELP,

26:51.392 --> 26:53.655
AND THAT'S WHY HE'D REACH
OUT TO A KINDRED SPIRIT
LIKE GALINA KADLEC.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.701
YEAH, BUT I CAN'T FIGURE
OUT HOW THEY COMMUNICATED
WITH EACH OTHER.

26:55.744 --> 26:56.832
PRENTISS: AND YOU
PROBABLY WON'T,

26:56.876 --> 26:58.486
BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO
RIGHT NOW

26:58.529 --> 27:00.270
IS SEE WHICH MEN
FROM RASK'S PAST

27:00.314 --> 27:02.664
LIVE IN OR AROUND
THE CARDOZO AREA.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.233
ROSSI, OVER PHONE:
JJ, WHAT DID RASK'S
MOTHER SAY?

27:50.277 --> 27:52.235
HE CALLED HER
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO,

27:52.279 --> 27:54.847
SAID HE WASN'T COMING
HOME BECAUSE SOMETHING
IMPORTANT HAD COME UP.

27:54.890 --> 27:57.110
DID SHE RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THE VICTIMS?

27:57.153 --> 27:58.894
ALVEZ, OVER PHONE:
SHE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
ANY OF THE MEN,

27:58.938 --> 28:01.723
BUT SHE DID RECOGNIZE
ALL 10 OF THE WOMEN
WHO RECEIVED PACKAGES.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.725
YEAH. AND JANEL SAID
THE REASON WHY

28:03.769 --> 28:05.248
SHE REMEMBERED
THESE WOMEN WAS

28:05.292 --> 28:06.989
BECAUSE OF HOW KIND THEY
ALL WERE TO HER SON.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.599
ALVEZ: YEAH, LIKE
PATRICIA SORRELLS

28:08.643 --> 28:10.471
WAS HIS HIGH SCHOOL
CHEMISTRY TEACHER

28:10.514 --> 28:12.516
WHO WROTE HIM A GLOWING
COLLEGE RECOMMENDATION,

28:12.560 --> 28:15.302
OR GEENA RAPTIS,
SHE HELPED HIM

28:15.345 --> 28:17.086
WHEN HE MISFILED
A TAX RETURN.

28:17.130 --> 28:19.567
YEAH, THE WAY SHE
DESCRIBED THESE WOMEN,

28:19.610 --> 28:22.222
I DON'T KNOW, IT WOULD
BE HARD TO IMAGINE

28:22.265 --> 28:25.051
ANY KIND OF RESENTMENT
RASK WOULD HAVE TOWARD THEM.

28:25.094 --> 28:28.315
YEAH, YOU'D THINK HE
WOULD BE GRATEFUL
TO THESE WOMEN.

28:28.358 --> 28:30.491
GIFT WRAPPING.

28:30.534 --> 28:32.101
WHAT ABOUT GIFT WRAPPING?

28:32.145 --> 28:34.016
YOU KNOW, I SAW IT BEFORE,

28:34.060 --> 28:36.627
AND YET I DIDN'T SEE IT
BECAUSE IT SEEMED OBVIOUS

28:36.671 --> 28:38.281
THAT HE JUST DIDN'T
WANT THE BOXES TO LEAK,

28:38.325 --> 28:41.415
BUT NOW, I THINK HE
WAS BEING EXACT...

28:42.677 --> 28:44.810
BECAUSE HE WAS
WRAPPING A GIFT.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.550
YOU THINK HE IS
GRATEFUL TO THEM?

28:46.594 --> 28:48.161
LEWIS: YES,
OF COURSE HE IS.

28:48.204 --> 28:49.771
AND HE WANTS TO
DEMONSTRATE HIS GRATITUDE

28:49.815 --> 28:50.990
THE BEST WAY HE KNOWS HOW--

28:51.033 --> 28:52.600
BY SHARING IN
HIS CELEBRITY,

28:52.643 --> 28:55.168
BY WRITING THESE WOMEN
INTO HIS OWN NARRATIVE.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.997
SO IT'S LIKE THE CAT
WHO OFFERS HIS OWNER
THE MOUSE HE JUST CAUGHT.

28:58.040 --> 29:02.305
OK, SO IF RASP REALLY IS
OFFERING UP THANK-YOU GIFTS,

29:02.349 --> 29:03.916
WHAT KIND OF GIFT
DO YOU THINK HE'D WANT

29:03.959 --> 29:05.613
TO GIVE GALINA KADLEC?

29:05.656 --> 29:07.746
SOMETHING TELLS ME
GALINA WOULD ASK

29:07.789 --> 29:09.922
FOR SOMEBODY QUITE
SPECIFIC.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.623
I KNOW YOU.

29:15.666 --> 29:18.713
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.933
I'M DAV--DAVID ROSSI,

29:20.976 --> 29:23.152
SUPERVISORY SPECIAL
AGENT, FBI,

29:23.196 --> 29:25.285
BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS UNIT,

29:25.328 --> 29:28.767
AUTHOR OF "DEVIANCE:
THE SECRET DESIRES

29:28.810 --> 29:30.769
OF SADISTIC
SERIAL KILLERS."

29:30.812 --> 29:33.293
THAT'S RIGHT.

29:33.336 --> 29:37.384
I'M SURE YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT AN INSPIRATION
YOUR WORK HAS BEEN.

29:38.820 --> 29:41.780
AND DO YOU THINK HE'S
A FAN, TOO?

29:47.873 --> 29:50.789
AND IF YOU THINK
THAT DOMINATRIX FACE

29:50.832 --> 29:53.487
IS BETTER THAN
A POKER FACE,

29:53.530 --> 29:54.836
IT AIN'T.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.577
I DON'T KNOW HIM.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.840
LET ME BE CRYSTAL
CLEAR WITH YOU.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.060
UNLESS I WALK OUT THAT DOOR

30:01.103 --> 30:02.888
WITH ALL THE ANSWERS
I'M LOOKING FOR,

30:02.931 --> 30:06.543
YOU CAN KISS THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE GOOD-BYE.

30:06.587 --> 30:10.678
HEH. YOU KNOW, IN
THE BDSM WORLD,

30:10.721 --> 30:13.072
THIS SORT OF ABUSE
REQUIRES CONSENT,

30:13.115 --> 30:16.684
A SAFE WORD,
LIKE "LAWYER."

30:16.727 --> 30:17.903
ARE YOU ASKING
FOR A LAWYER?

30:17.946 --> 30:19.165
NO.

30:19.208 --> 30:21.689
I DON'T NEED
ANYONE TO SAVE ME.

30:21.732 --> 30:23.865
I'VE LEARNED HOW TO
HANDLE MEN LIKE YOU,

30:23.909 --> 30:26.128
MEN WHO THINK THEY
CAN MANIPULATE ME

30:26.172 --> 30:28.348
OR EVEN INTIMIDATE ME
INTO SUBMISSION.

30:28.391 --> 30:31.438
WELL, YEAH, I KNOW
YOU'VE HAD MANY MEN
OF THIS TYPE

30:31.481 --> 30:33.135
IN YOUR LIFE,

30:33.179 --> 30:36.878
GUYS HAVE TRIED TO
RIP YOU OFF, PROSECUTE YOU,

30:36.922 --> 30:40.969
TAKE YOUR FOR
EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT
IN A DIVORCE.

30:41.013 --> 30:42.797
I SURVIVED.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.364
AND NOW I THRIVE.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.583
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY,

30:46.627 --> 30:49.325
YOU ATTRACT WHAT YOU ARE.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.240
THAT'S A LIE.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.155
BECAUSE YOU CAN
BE BETRAYED.

30:53.199 --> 30:56.593
YES, YOU CAN.

30:56.637 --> 30:59.509
AND I CAN TELL BY
THAT TONE IN YOUR VOICE

30:59.553 --> 31:01.860
THAT YOU FEEL BETRAYED BY

31:01.903 --> 31:04.775
THE MAN YOU PROMISED
TO CHERISH

31:04.819 --> 31:08.736
IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH
FOR AS LONG AS YOU BOTH
SHALL LIVE.

31:08.779 --> 31:11.695
BUT THE PROBLEM IS,

31:11.739 --> 31:13.828
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

31:13.872 --> 31:18.354
OR MAYBE YOU'VE ALREADY
ARRANGED TO TAKE CARE

31:18.398 --> 31:19.703
OF THAT PROBLEM.

31:21.749 --> 31:25.448
I THINK I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE MY LAWYER NOW.

31:25.492 --> 31:28.495
EMILY, I KNOW WHO
THE NEXT VICTIM IS.

31:28.538 --> 31:31.715
IT'S GALINA'S EX-HUSBAND
BYRON MADDOCK.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.641
EMMANUEL: SEE, THE TRUTH IS,

31:44.685 --> 31:47.122
ORDINARILY,

31:47.166 --> 31:51.083
I WOULD PREFER
TO GO BAREBACK.

31:52.649 --> 31:55.478
BUT TONIGHT,

31:55.522 --> 31:57.785
I'M TAKING REQUESTS.

31:57.828 --> 31:59.787
BYRON: WHO...

31:59.830 --> 32:03.269
ARE...YOU?

32:05.880 --> 32:08.274
I'M THE GUY THAT'S GONNA
CUT YOU INTO LITTLE PIECES.

32:08.317 --> 32:10.885
NO. NO.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.975
LET ME GO.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.760
HEY!

32:18.675 --> 32:20.634
HEY.

32:20.677 --> 32:23.463
GALINA SAYS HELLO,
BITCH.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.040
JJ, TALK TO ME.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.867
D.C. METRO POLICE
IS CONFIRMING A BREAK-IN

32:36.911 --> 32:37.912
AT BYRON MADDOCK'S HOUSE.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.870
NO SIGN OF MADDOCK
OR HIS CAR.

32:39.914 --> 32:40.959
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
THERE NOW.

32:41.002 --> 32:42.264
ALL RIGHT, SPENCE AND I
ARE ON OUR WAY

32:42.308 --> 32:43.744
TO MADDOCK'S OFFICE
IN BETHESDA.

32:43.787 --> 32:46.834
WHOA, HOLD YOUR
CRIME-FIGHTING HORSES,
MATT AND SPENCE,

32:46.877 --> 32:48.792
I CAN DO YOU ONE BETTER
THAN HIS OFFICE.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.011
I FOUND HIS ARSENAL.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.404
WHAT ARSENAL?

32:51.447 --> 32:53.710
THE ARSENAL IS A NICKNAME
FOR AN ABANDONED ARMORY

32:53.754 --> 32:55.147
IN ROCKVILLE THAT WAS
PREVIOUSLY OWNED

32:55.190 --> 32:57.845
BY GALINA KADLEC'S
OLD COMPANY FAU-TYPE,

32:57.888 --> 33:00.195
AND THEY USED IT AS
A PRODUCTION STUDIO

33:00.239 --> 33:02.806
TO CREATE FETISH CONTENT
FOR THE FAU-TYPE WEBSITES.

33:02.850 --> 33:05.722
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY ARE WE JUST FINDING
OUT ABOUT THIS PLACE?

33:05.766 --> 33:07.942
BECAUSE I JUST FOUND IT
UNDER A BIG CYBER ROCK.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.901
IT LOOKS LIKE GALINA
AND HER EX WERE IN
A SUPER BITTER LEGAL BATTLE

33:10.945 --> 33:12.947
OVER THIS PARTICULAR
PIECE OF PROPERTY,

33:12.991 --> 33:14.644
AND THE BANK HAS
FORECLOSED ON IT.

33:14.688 --> 33:16.646
THAT'S IT.
IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE

33:16.690 --> 33:18.431
FOR RASK TO FEEL
SAFE AND SECURE.

33:18.474 --> 33:20.215
AND I'M SURE GALINA
LET HIM KNOW

33:20.259 --> 33:22.087
EXACTLY HOW TO ACCESS
THE BUILDING.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.088
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

33:23.131 --> 33:24.785
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

33:24.828 --> 33:28.441
BYRON: PLEASE. PLEASE.

33:28.484 --> 33:29.790
LISTEN TO ME.

33:31.357 --> 33:32.793
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SHE'S TOLD YOU,

33:32.836 --> 33:34.403
BUT NONE OF IT IS TRUE.

33:34.447 --> 33:37.754
WAIT.
WHAT DOES SHE WANT?

33:37.798 --> 33:39.713
SHE WANT ME
TO APOLOGIZE?

33:39.756 --> 33:41.410
IS THAT IS?

33:41.454 --> 33:44.065
IS THAT WHAT SHE WANTS?

33:44.109 --> 33:45.545
TELL ME!

33:53.814 --> 33:56.338
OK, WHEN WE FIND THEM
IN THERE,

33:56.382 --> 33:58.036
I WANT YOU GUYS
TO FOLLOW MY LEAD.

33:59.602 --> 34:02.779
I'M SORRY, OK?

34:02.823 --> 34:04.955
PLEASE TELL HER
THAT I'M SORRY.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.963
OH, GOD, YOU SICK
SON OF A BITCH.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.881
AHH!

34:17.925 --> 34:19.666
YOU KNOW,

34:19.709 --> 34:24.018
GALINA AND I HAVE KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR

34:24.062 --> 34:27.587
QUITE A WHILE NOW.

34:27.630 --> 34:30.677
HER WEBSITES SPOKE TO ME.

34:30.720 --> 34:33.854
I'D BE ON THEM,
AND I'D REALIZE

34:33.897 --> 34:36.030
I'M NOT ALONE.

34:45.474 --> 34:47.259
SO...

34:47.302 --> 34:50.914
IN ORDER TO EXPRESS
MY UNDYING GRATITUDE,

34:50.958 --> 34:53.613
I PROMISED TO SEND HER
A SPECIAL GIFT--

34:53.656 --> 34:56.746
YOUR HEAD...

34:56.790 --> 34:58.966
ON A PLATTER.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.465
SIMMONS: EMMANUEL RASK!

35:19.508 --> 35:20.727
PUT DOWN THE WEAPON.

35:20.770 --> 35:21.945
HELP ME.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.686
BYRON, STAY CALM.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA
BE OK.

35:23.730 --> 35:26.428
MR. RASK, PUT THE WEAPON
DOWN AND PUT YOUR HANDS
IN THE AIR.

35:26.472 --> 35:29.127
SO CLOSE AND YET SO FAR.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.432
EMMANUEL.

35:33.218 --> 35:39.746
WELL, THIS IS UNEXPECTED.

35:39.789 --> 35:42.270
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

35:42.314 --> 35:43.967
YES, I DO.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.494
I'VE READ ALL YOUR BOOKS.

35:48.537 --> 35:49.886
THAT'S WHAT GALINA
TOLD ME.

35:49.930 --> 35:54.152
SHE SAID YOUR
FAVORITE WAS, UM,

35:54.195 --> 35:55.414
"DEVIANCE."

35:55.457 --> 35:58.199
NO, THAT WAS HER FAVORITE.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.854
ACTUALLY, I PREFER
"EYE OF THE PREDATOR."

36:00.897 --> 36:04.074
EMMANUEL, I'M BEING
VERY SERIOUS NOW.

36:04.118 --> 36:07.817
YOU HAVE MY UNDIVIDED
ATTENTION.

36:07.861 --> 36:09.558
I SHOULD.

36:10.907 --> 36:13.432
YES, YOU SHOULD.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.742
I'M NOT GOING
BACK TO PRISON.

36:19.786 --> 36:22.876
YEAH, BUT IF NOT,

36:22.919 --> 36:24.834
WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO TALK.

36:24.878 --> 36:28.838
AND THEN HOW WOULD
I BE ABLE TO TELL
YOUR STORY?

36:31.101 --> 36:32.929
WE DO HAVE A LOT
TO TALK ABOUT.

36:32.973 --> 36:34.279
YES, WE DO, SON.

36:34.322 --> 36:37.804
BUT IN ORDER
FOR US TO TALK,

36:37.847 --> 36:41.416
YOU HAVE TO FIRST
LET THIS MAN GO.

36:46.291 --> 36:49.468
YEAH, BUT I MADE
A PROMISE TO GALINA.

36:49.511 --> 36:51.252
BUT IF YOU DO THAT,

36:51.296 --> 36:56.083
ALL OF THESE MEN
WILL CUT YOU DOWN
WHERE YOU STAND,

36:56.126 --> 37:01.219
AND I'LL NEVER TELL
YOUR STORY.

37:07.050 --> 37:10.184
WELL.

37:14.841 --> 37:18.192
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE ONE HELL OF
A STORY TO TELL, TOO.

37:22.109 --> 37:24.677
COME HERE.

37:25.721 --> 37:26.679
AHH! AHH!

37:26.722 --> 37:29.377
HA HA HA!

37:36.123 --> 37:37.777
ROSSI: YOU KNOW, IT
WAS ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.866
I WAS HAVING DINNER
WITH JASON GIDEON,

37:39.909 --> 37:41.998
AND I TOLD HIM I WAS
THINKING ABOUT LEAVING THE BAU,

37:42.042 --> 37:45.567
MAYBE WRITE A BOOK,
YOU KNOW, ABOUT OUR WORK.

37:45.611 --> 37:48.178
BUT HE CAUTIONED ME.

37:48.222 --> 37:49.615
ABOUT WHAT?

37:49.658 --> 37:51.138
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT A BOOK

37:51.181 --> 37:53.488
LIKE THAT WOULD DO MORE
HARM THAN GOOD.

37:53.532 --> 37:56.274
WELL, WITH RESPECTS,
I DISAGREE.

37:56.317 --> 37:59.407
DAVE, YOUR BOOKS HAVE
PROVIDED AN INVALUABLE
RESOURCE

37:59.451 --> 38:01.627
TO EVERYONE, NOT TO
MENTION LAW ENFORCEMENT.

38:01.670 --> 38:03.672
AND THEY'RE JUST
KICK ASS TO READ.

38:03.716 --> 38:06.066
THANK YOU.

38:06.109 --> 38:11.201
BUT...ACTUALLY,
THAT WAS KIND OF
TO GIDEON'S POINT.

38:11.245 --> 38:14.161
HE WAS CONCERNED THAT
BY TELLING THESE STORIES,

38:14.204 --> 38:16.294
IT MIGHT CREATE A PRURIENT
INTEREST THAT WOULD BE

38:16.337 --> 38:21.124
MORE ABOUT CONSUMING
PORNOGRAPHY.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.474
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

38:24.040 --> 38:25.433
I DIDN'T HAVE AN ANSWER.

38:38.359 --> 38:41.406
HEY, DAD.
HI.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.022
DID YOU CATCH
THE BAD GUY?

38:49.065 --> 38:50.980
YES.

38:51.024 --> 38:54.288
MY TEAM AND I,
WE, UH, WE GOT HIM.

38:56.812 --> 39:00.076
HEY, LISTEN, I, UH,
I HEARD ABOUT TRINA'S MOM.

39:01.295 --> 39:03.428
I KNOW HOW SCARY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN BE.

39:03.471 --> 39:05.343
DO YOU EVER GET SCARED
AT YOUR JOB?

39:05.386 --> 39:07.214
YES.

39:07.257 --> 39:08.520
MORE OFTEN THAN I'D LIKE.

39:08.563 --> 39:11.131
DO YOU FEEL IT, LIKE
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

39:11.174 --> 39:13.263
OF YOUR STOMACH,
LIKE I DO?

39:13.307 --> 39:15.527
SOMETIMES.

39:16.876 --> 39:18.791
SO THE OTHER DAY,

39:18.834 --> 39:21.271
KEITH DAWSON WAS BEING
LIKE A TOTAL JERK

39:21.315 --> 39:26.364
AND JOKING AROUND
ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW
ON TV, THE COPS,

39:26.407 --> 39:28.975
THEY ALWAYS WEAR
LIKE THE BULLET-PROOF
VESTS, RIGHT?

39:29.018 --> 39:30.585
RIGHT.

39:30.629 --> 39:34.284
SO KEITH WAS SAYING
THAT IT'S LIKE
REALLY STUPID

39:34.328 --> 39:37.113
BECAUSE ON THESE SHOWS,
YOU NEVER SEE THE BAD GUYS

39:37.157 --> 39:39.377
JUST SHOOT THE COPS
IN THE FACE.

39:40.639 --> 39:42.292
THAT'S WHEN I FELT
THAT BALL IN MY STOMACH,

39:42.336 --> 39:44.077
AND I PUNCHED KEITH.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.340
BUT IT WASN'T
THAT HARD, I SWEAR.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.342
I GET IT.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.430
I'M SORRY I
DISAPPOINTED YOU.

39:49.474 --> 39:54.130
HEY, YOU DID NOT
DISAPPOINT ME.

39:54.174 --> 39:57.264
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES.

39:57.307 --> 39:59.875
WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE LEARN FROM THEM.

39:59.919 --> 40:01.486
I WILL.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.183
I KNOW YOU WILL.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.490
AND LISTEN, DAVID,

40:05.533 --> 40:08.362
I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN
SUPER HARD,

40:08.406 --> 40:12.279
AND THE TRUTH IS,
I DON'T KNOW IF GETS
ANY EASIER

40:12.322 --> 40:13.585
AS YOU GROW UP.

40:13.628 --> 40:16.370
BUT I CAN PROMISE
YOU ONE THING.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.633
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
IN THIS WORLD,

40:18.677 --> 40:21.419
YOUR MOM AND I WILL
ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

40:22.811 --> 40:24.378
ALWAYS.

40:25.858 --> 40:27.337
COME HERE.

40:27.381 --> 40:30.340
OH, HO HO HO!

40:30.384 --> 40:32.038
I LOVE YOU, BUD.

40:32.081 --> 40:33.561
DAVID: I LOVE YOU, TOO, DAD.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.567
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

40:39.611 --> 40:41.308
PAY NO ATTENTION
TO THE WOMAN

40:41.351 --> 40:42.352
LYING ON THE COUCH.

40:42.396 --> 40:43.397
CARRY ON.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.355
LET'S GET HER.

40:45.399 --> 40:47.357
SIMMONS, VOICE-OVER:
"CHILDREN HAVE NEVER
BEEN VERY GOOD

40:47.401 --> 40:49.403

BUT THEY HAVE NEVER
FAILED TO IMITATE THEM."
