WEBVTT

00:50.676 --> 00:52.219
Vas-y, vas-y!

00:52.386 --> 00:54.388
<i>Vas-y, suivez-moi!</i>

00:56.306 --> 00:59.726
II'

01:34.678 --> 01:38.432
II'

01:48.900 --> 01:55.115
II'

02:24.561 --> 02:25.854
Sir Josiah.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.399
II'

02:50.087 --> 02:52.964
How can the French do that?

02:53.131 --> 02:55.133
Get rid of their king
in an afternoon?

02:55.300 --> 02:57.219
They have done it before.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.012
There are revolutions
all across Europe.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.683
Vienna, Berlin...

03:02.849 --> 03:05.519
Leopold is worried
about Belgium.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.229
Thank God
for the English Channel.

03:07.396 --> 03:10.107
I'm not sure
that it will be enough.

03:11.900 --> 03:15.153
Ideas can swim.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.157
II'

03:33.588 --> 03:36.675
II'

03:56.737 --> 03:59.489
Order!

03:59.656 --> 04:01.283
As foreign secretary,

04:01.450 --> 04:04.536
I have congratulated
the new French Republic

04:04.703 --> 04:05.996
on their liberation

04:06.163 --> 04:07.372
from an odious tyrant.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.750
And I act

04:09.916 --> 04:13.170
with the full support
of the prime minister.

04:15.714 --> 04:21.178
The autocrats of Europe will lie
uneasy in their beds tonight,

04:21.344 --> 04:23.221
knowing that the French people

04:23.388 --> 04:25.682
have risen up
against an unjust king.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.102
Order!

04:29.269 --> 04:30.562
There is a tide

04:30.729 --> 04:33.315
of liberty abroad,

04:33.482 --> 04:37.068
which, taken at the flood,
will lead on to fortune.

04:39.988 --> 04:43.074
II'

04:49.539 --> 04:50.707
Marron glacÃ©.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.751
My favorite!

04:52.918 --> 04:54.211
Emma...

04:54.377 --> 04:55.817
It's such a comfort
to have you back.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.589
I'm against party politics,
of course,

04:57.756 --> 05:00.759
but my... Whig ladies are
so much more attentive.

05:00.926 --> 05:04.012
And my new mistress of the robes
has settled in nicely.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.514
Haven't you, Sophie?

05:05.680 --> 05:08.266
I'm afraid my grasp of protocol
is woeful.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.851
I have no idea

05:10.018 --> 05:14.356
whether a bishop should
take precedence over a marquis.

05:14.523 --> 05:17.442
My husband is afraid
I shall make some terrible gaffe.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.402
Not at all,
my dear... your enthusiasm

05:19.569 --> 05:21.169
more than makes up
for your inexperience.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.759
I'm not worried in the least,
Duchess.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.534
I like to have my friends
about me.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.619
When 1 think
of poor Louis. Philippe...

05:30.872 --> 05:33.333
Without our permission?

05:36.920 --> 05:40.674
Then Lord Palmerston needs
to explain himself.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.640
After you, sir.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.812
God bless you, Palm!

05:53.979 --> 05:55.313
God bless you.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.275
You have such a vulgar
following, Palmerston.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.569
There's nothing vulgar
about the British public,

06:00.735 --> 06:03.071
Russell. Oh!

06:05.282 --> 06:08.285
II'

06:13.665 --> 06:15.166
Oh!

06:15.333 --> 06:16.710
No time for that, Mr. Penge.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.396
Prime minister and Lord
Palmerston are on their way.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.629
Palmerston, eh?

06:19.796 --> 06:22.632
Make sure you stay
out of sight, girls.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.801
No woman is safe.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.928
II'

06:40.567 --> 06:43.236
II'

06:54.039 --> 06:55.290
Afternoon.

06:55.457 --> 06:59.961
II'

07:13.391 --> 07:15.018
Prime Minister.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.228
Your Majesty.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.147
Your Majesty,
Your Royal Highness.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.690
Do you know why
we asked you here?

07:20.857 --> 07:23.276
Because I'm an asset
to any gathering, ma'am?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.737
We have been informed that you
have been corresponding

07:25.904 --> 07:28.114
with the revolutionary
government in France.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.867
I wrote to Monsieur Lamartine
to congratulate him

07:31.034 --> 07:32.786
on his speedy resolution
to the crisis.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.664
You congratulated
him on deposing the king.

07:35.830 --> 07:39.668
Did you approve this, Prime Minister?
I can't say

07:39.834 --> 07:42.504
that I actually approved...
I acted on my own initiative, ma'am.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.882
You had no right to do
such a thing in our...

07:46.049 --> 07:48.093
In the queen's name.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.719
Perhaps not, sir,

07:49.886 --> 07:51.429
but I speak for the people.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.741
They believe that the day
when Europe is ruled by despots

07:53.765 --> 07:54.891
is coming to an end.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.726
You forget, Lord Palmerston,

07:56.893 --> 07:58.186
that you are talking

07:58.353 --> 08:01.856
about our family and friends.

08:02.023 --> 08:06.945
I'm sure that in the future,

08:07.112 --> 08:08.989
the foreign secretary will send

08:09.155 --> 08:11.658
copies of his correspondence

08:11.825 --> 08:12.951
here first.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.577
You seem very sure

08:14.744 --> 08:16.384
of what the people think,
Lord Palmerston.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.373
I make it my business, ma'am.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.710
The British public
is like a beautiful woman.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.047
And wish to glory
in her smiles-.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.050
II'

08:32.637 --> 08:35.223
King Louis Philippe
has been forced to flee

08:35.390 --> 08:36.630
with his tail between his legs.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.476
I wonder where he'll go.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.645
As long as he knows
he's not welcome here.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.192
Judging from the size of you,

08:46.359 --> 08:47.861
you must be the new footman.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.279
Joseph Weld, sir.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.740
And where do you come from,
Joseph?

08:51.906 --> 08:54.075
Uh, Chatsworth, sir.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.952
I was Her Grace's footman.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.079
From what I hear,

08:58.246 --> 08:59.414
I am surprised she could part

08:59.581 --> 09:01.833
with a strapping fellow
like you.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.847
The duke gave me
a very good character, sir.

09:05.879 --> 09:10.050
Chatsworth is a fair-sized
establishment, I dare say,

09:10.216 --> 09:11.551
but this is the palace,

09:11.718 --> 09:13.219
and we expect
the highest standards

09:13.386 --> 09:14.554
from our servants.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.891
Yes, sir.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.642
II'

09:31.196 --> 09:34.532
<i>And I say to you,
this is a time of reckoning</i>

09:34.699 --> 09:36.826
<i>for working men everywhere!</i>

09:38.953 --> 09:41.998
Louis Philippe has abdicated
because the French people

09:42.165 --> 09:44.876
would not tolerate aristocracy
anylongefl.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.961
And I say the time has come

09:47.128 --> 09:49.672
for the workers of this country
to do the same!

09:49.839 --> 09:53.259
I believe we should swear
allegiance not to the queen,

09:53.426 --> 09:54.546
but to the People's Charter.

09:57.347 --> 09:58.890
And I say, Cuffay,

09:59.057 --> 10:04.104
that no good will come of this
kind of revolutionary talk.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.607
We will win the day not by
force, but by numbers!

10:09.192 --> 10:11.069
When the government sees
the multitudes

10:11.236 --> 10:16.282
marching on London to present
our petition signed by millions,

10:16.449 --> 10:19.244
they will understand
there is no power greater

10:19.410 --> 10:21.746
than that of the people!

10:25.291 --> 10:26.459
What's your name?

10:26.626 --> 10:27.836
Samuel Price.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.504
I'm Abigail.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.049
Make your mark there, Mr. Price,

10:33.216 --> 10:36.219
and {will write your name
beside it.

10:43.893 --> 10:48.189
II'

10:50.024 --> 10:51.210
I have to get back to the queen.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.902
No...

10:53.069 --> 10:55.363
But we're engaged.

10:55.530 --> 10:56.656
Mm. We have to wait!

10:56.823 --> 10:58.783
I'm not leaving here
in disgrace.

11:03.580 --> 11:07.959
II'

11:11.713 --> 11:15.425
Victoria, listen.

11:15.592 --> 11:19.596
"The proletarians have nothing
to lose but their chains.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.390
They have a world to win."

11:25.018 --> 11:26.144
Who said that?

11:26.311 --> 11:28.188
A Chartist? Ah, no, no.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.399
It is, um... Karl Marx.

11:33.234 --> 11:36.321
He is a German, but I believe
he's living in Manchester.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.454
We cannot be too complacent.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.962
II'

11:55.798 --> 11:57.550
<i>Eight tens are 80,</i>

11:57.717 --> 12:00.345
eight 11s are 88,
and eight 12s are 96.

12:00.511 --> 12:02.111
Would you like me
to do it in French now,

12:02.138 --> 12:04.307
Lady Lyttelton? Not now, dear.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.975
It's Bertie's turn.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.311
But Bertie hates multiplication,
don't you, Bertie?

12:08.478 --> 12:10.813
I like... running!

12:16.194 --> 12:18.905
II'

12:22.492 --> 12:23.993
Papa. Bertie.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.329
Good afternoon, Mama.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.580
Good afternoon.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.459
Do I not get a curtsy?

12:31.626 --> 12:33.086
You are not the sovereign, Papa.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.797
Oh, I see.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.550
May I try it on, Mama?

12:39.717 --> 12:42.679
Be careful, darling,
it's very heavy.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.851
Shall we see how
you look in it, Bertie?

12:49.018 --> 12:50.561
Crowns are for girls!

12:53.856 --> 12:55.275
A letter, ma'am.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.776
Thank you.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.069
Ah, ah, ah.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.825
Louis Philippe.

13:03.992 --> 13:07.704
Asking if we will...
take him in.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.622
II'

13:14.877 --> 13:17.755
Whoa!

13:17.922 --> 13:23.094
II'

13:25.513 --> 13:26.806
Albert, we can't turn him away!

13:26.973 --> 13:28.766
No, perhaps not, but my fear is

13:28.933 --> 13:32.312
that if we start allowing this
palace to become a sanctuary...

13:32.478 --> 13:34.731
Your Majesty.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.024
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.

13:36.190 --> 13:40.278
Your Majesty,
your sister is here.

13:44.365 --> 13:48.244
II'

13:52.874 --> 13:54.459
Feodora?

13:58.171 --> 14:00.340
II'

14:02.550 --> 14:04.761
Oh, Feo.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.013
It is you!

14:07.180 --> 14:09.349
II'

14:09.515 --> 14:11.476
How, why...

14:11.642 --> 14:13.478
Drina!

14:13.644 --> 14:14.771
Look at you.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.189
Fee...

14:16.356 --> 14:19.442
have not stopped for three days.

14:21.652 --> 14:24.697
And this is cousin Albert.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.658
Oh, I am so happy to meet you...

14:27.825 --> 14:30.745
At last.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.081
And the children.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.625
This must be Vicky,

14:35.792 --> 14:37.919
<i>such a kleine mÃ©dchen.</i>

14:38.086 --> 14:40.004
And this...

14:40.171 --> 14:42.465
This is little Albert.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.592
Oh, he looks just like you did
at that age, Drina.

14:49.055 --> 14:52.016
And so many children!

14:52.183 --> 14:55.311
And another one along the way.

14:55.478 --> 14:58.773
This is... so unexpected.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.358
I had no time to write.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.528
I was so frightened
that the mob would catch me.

15:03.694 --> 15:04.904
Mob?

15:05.071 --> 15:06.322
Bertie, Vicky, come along.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.241
I was taking the waters in Baden

15:08.408 --> 15:11.744
when the riots started
against the king.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.955
I could
not go back to Langenburg

15:14.122 --> 15:15.748
to my husband and my children.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.458
It was too dangerous.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.127
And so I exchanged clothes

15:19.293 --> 15:21.129
with my maid,

15:21.295 --> 15:23.131
took a place in a coach
to Ostend.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.800
I was so frightened
I would be recognized.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.219
Not for myself, of course,

15:28.386 --> 15:30.638
but for my connection to you.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.432
You did the right thing.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.767
Mm. Yes, indeed.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.770
I am so glad to see you.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.524
After all these years.

15:41.691 --> 15:46.195
My own dear little sister.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.869
II'

16:04.297 --> 16:05.882
She doesn't
look like a princess.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.258
Her Serene Highness

16:07.425 --> 16:08.425
Princess Feodora.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.635
The queen's half-sister.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.096
Fallen on hard times.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.598
I didn't know she had a sister.

16:13.764 --> 16:14.992
From her mother's
first marriage.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.059
I think weld all forgotten.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.895
Even the queen.

16:21.772 --> 16:25.443
II'

16:25.610 --> 16:28.988
To arrive like that
with no warning.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.531
Really, it's...

16:30.698 --> 16:32.450
Well, her life was in danger.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.869
How long is she going to stay?

16:35.036 --> 16:37.121
It's hardly convenient
at the moment,

16:37.288 --> 16:39.373
and we've got Louis Philippe
to deal with.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.625
Victoria.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.168
She's your sister.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.170
It's not like you and Ernest.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.923
I hardly know her.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.966
She left me to get married
when I was...

16:49.133 --> 16:50.551
Oh, forgive me!

16:52.011 --> 16:53.930
I was looking for my room and...

16:54.096 --> 16:55.681
I am lost.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.353
What a change
from dear Kensington.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.773
Everything here is so...
imposing.

17:03.940 --> 17:04.940
Hmm.

17:09.946 --> 17:13.866
II'

17:26.212 --> 17:27.547
Oh, Bertie.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.549
It is not a toyÂ»
it's for doing sums.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.054
Bertie!

17:35.221 --> 17:36.847
Give this to Aunt Feo

17:37.014 --> 17:38.975
and apologize
for being so clumsy.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.645
Sorry, Aunt Feo.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.146
Look.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.731
There's a hole in your skirt.

17:45.898 --> 17:46.983
Oh.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.193
Such moths in Langenburg.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.653
Why didn't you get your maid

17:50.820 --> 17:52.905
to sew it up?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.991
Listen to this.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.743
"We need the forcible overthrow"

17:57.910 --> 17:59.412
"of all existing
social conditions."

17:59.579 --> 18:01.747
"Workers of the world, unite."

18:01.914 --> 18:03.874
Karl Marx.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.626
The communist?

18:05.793 --> 18:07.312
Well,
Mr. Marx should be told that the English

18:07.336 --> 18:09.797
are never going
to unite with foreigners.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.382
Well, actually, Victoria,

18:11.549 --> 18:13.634
there are reports
of Chartists going to Paris

18:13.801 --> 18:15.428
to congratulate Lamartine.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.555
That doesn't mean
they're going to unite with him.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.348
Well, how can you be so sure?

18:19.515 --> 18:21.225
You, you know nothing

18:21.392 --> 18:22.768
of how these people live.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.812
You do?

18:24.979 --> 18:26.814
No.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.610
But I am going to find out.

18:30.776 --> 18:35.031
II'

18:42.038 --> 18:43.664
Here you are, Mrs. Skerrett.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.207
24 pairs,

18:45.374 --> 18:47.209
with a number and initial
on each one.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.295
Very nice, as usual.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.963
I can never get stitches
that small.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.132
I always try to give
satisfaction.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.592
And I need the work, so...

18:59.263 --> 19:01.599
I... didn't take you
for a Chartist, Abigail.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.518
Born to it, you might say.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.354
My father was at Peterloo.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.357
And you believe
in these Six Points'?

19:09.523 --> 19:11.442
Working men need the vote.

19:11.609 --> 19:12.902
And what about working women?

19:13.069 --> 19:15.196
Rome wasn't built in a day.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.661
Stop it!

19:21.827 --> 19:23.579
Do you think you could contrive

19:23.746 --> 19:25.015
to leave the palace for an hour?

19:25.039 --> 19:27.667
I have something
I want to show you.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.503
What is it'?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.421
Surprise.

19:39.095 --> 19:44.600
II'

20:01.117 --> 20:03.661
All of these
people, they live here?

20:03.828 --> 20:05.746
Yes, sir.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.003
Thank you, sir.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.047
Thank you.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.682
There are 14 people living
in there.

20:24.849 --> 20:26.559
They are human beings,

20:26.726 --> 20:28.853
yet they are being forced
to live like vermin.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.691
The rich man in his castle,

20:33.858 --> 20:34.984
The poor man at his gate.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.311
God made them high and lowly.

20:36.444 --> 20:37.778
And ordered their estate.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.284
I don't think God has
anything to do with this,

20:43.451 --> 20:44.618
Lord Alfred.

20:46.579 --> 20:47.747
Do you?

20:47.913 --> 20:49.665
No, I don't.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.044
II'

21:06.849 --> 21:09.685
I used to come here with you,

21:09.852 --> 21:11.012
on that little Shetland pony.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.563
King George gave you.

21:12.730 --> 21:14.440
Nasty animal.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.525
It was always biting me.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.110
Such happy times.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.070
That's not
how I remember Kensington.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.322
But you left when I was...

21:21.489 --> 21:22.907
Nine.

21:23.073 --> 21:25.576
Your departure was so sudden.

21:25.743 --> 21:27.053
But, of course,
you were in a hurry

21:27.077 --> 21:28.077
to get married.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.330
What about you, Sophie?

21:29.497 --> 21:30.706
Were you in a fever

21:30.873 --> 21:32.833
of impatience to start
your married life?

21:33.918 --> 21:35.628
My mother was.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.235
She always wanted me
to be a duchess.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.009
I couldn't wait to marry
the prince.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.136
But, of course,
I had other ties.

22:01.487 --> 22:02.780
My money's on the Englishman.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.741
Very good, sir.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.159
Come on, Billy.

22:09.245 --> 22:12.623
II'

22:12.790 --> 22:15.918
This is just
how the mob sounded in Baden.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.546
Are you sure we are safe
in the open, Drina?

22:18.712 --> 22:20.881
I don't need to hide
from my subjects.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.717
Ooh, get up, up, up, up, up!

22:25.845 --> 22:27.721
Two, three, four...

22:29.431 --> 22:31.267
Go on!

22:31.433 --> 22:32.768
Get him! Go on!

22:32.935 --> 22:35.187
Yes!

22:35.354 --> 22:36.522
Yeah!

22:38.732 --> 22:40.860
Well played, sir.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.322
What on Earth is causing
that commotion?

22:45.489 --> 22:47.741
Lord Palmerston, ma'am.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.244
II'

23:13.434 --> 23:15.895
Are you mad?
Peaceably if we may,

23:16.061 --> 23:18.147
forcibly if we must, O'Connor.

23:18.314 --> 23:20.608
We need the support
of respectable people.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.235
They won't vote for a mob,
Cuffay.

23:30.951 --> 23:34.204
Awful, awful man.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.915
Do you know what I saw today?

23:36.081 --> 23:37.541
I saw 14 people

23:37.708 --> 23:39.019
living in one room...
He was in the park,

23:39.043 --> 23:40.669
cavorting with the crowds

23:40.836 --> 23:42.463
<i>as</i> if he were
P.T. Barnum himself.

23:42.630 --> 23:43.797
Albert, he's vulgar!

23:44.924 --> 23:47.009
I do apologize, Your Majesty.

23:47.176 --> 23:51.138
The prime minister
and the foreign secretary

23:51.305 --> 23:53.807
are waiting in the drawing room,
Your Majesty.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.476
They insist it is a matter

23:55.643 --> 23:56.727
of some urgency, ma'am.

23:56.894 --> 23:58.520
Oh, Lord, what now?

23:58.687 --> 24:03.108
Uh... Palmer is "Pilger"
in German,

24:03.275 --> 24:05.736
and stone is "Stein," so...

24:05.903 --> 24:07.321
take your time.

24:07.488 --> 24:10.866
I do not mind keeping
Lord Pilgerstein waiting.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.246
It has everything
we're looking for, Nancy.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.457
Five parlor bedrooms

24:18.624 --> 24:20.918
and a dining room that seats 50.

24:21.085 --> 24:22.962
Perfect!

24:23.128 --> 24:25.005
I hope this is the right time
to be doing this.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.257
Why wouldn't it be?

24:27.424 --> 24:29.802
We're working people,
just like them.

24:29.969 --> 24:33.931
I've spent my whole life
trying to be more than that.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.100
This collar,

24:36.266 --> 24:37.946
the queen got me this,
and these stockings.

24:38.102 --> 24:40.396
She made me, Charles.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.564
What am I going to be
without her?

24:43.983 --> 24:47.111
You underestimate yourself.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.159
Hmm.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.967
Prime Minister. Your Majesty.

25:10.134 --> 25:12.594
Please, sit.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.555
You have urgent business,
Prime Minister?

25:14.722 --> 25:15.848
I'm afraid

25:16.015 --> 25:17.516
the Chartists, ma'am,

25:17.683 --> 25:20.728
seem minded to follow
the example of the French.

25:20.894 --> 25:24.189
There have been disturbances
across the capital...

25:24.356 --> 25:27.026
PALMERS believe what the prime
minister is trying to say

25:27.192 --> 25:29.570
is that the Chartists mean
revolution, ma'am.

25:29.737 --> 25:33.115
But then we, the ruling class,

25:33.282 --> 25:35.284
must give them an alternative.

25:35.451 --> 25:37.703
If we give the vote
to an illiterate mob,

25:37.870 --> 25:39.510
we're signing
our own death warrants, sir.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.083
Only today,

25:43.250 --> 25:45.794
Lord Palmerston, I have seen
people living in conditions

25:45.961 --> 25:47.546
which are infernal.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.423
We must do something otherwise.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.508
With respect, sir,

25:51.675 --> 25:53.302
now is not the time
for do-gooding.

25:53.469 --> 25:56.430
The Chartists are
planning a mass protest

25:56.597 --> 25:57.681
on April the 10th,

25:57.848 --> 25:59.892
that in our opinion...

26:00.059 --> 26:01.703
Will be the spark
that lights the tinderbox.

26:01.727 --> 26:02.978
But do you have any proof?

26:04.521 --> 26:06.231
Don't believe
my people wish me harm.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.651
I imagine that's what
Louis Philippe thought, ma'am.

26:11.570 --> 26:15.407
Well, you can ask him yourself
at dinner tomorrow.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.243
Unless you have a boxing match
you wish to go to.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.671
I am sorry to bother you,
but my wig...

26:29.838 --> 26:31.465
It's molting.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.344
Some of the pomade fell

26:35.511 --> 26:36.720
into the prince's tea.

26:36.887 --> 26:39.223
He didn't notice,
but, but Mr. Penge did.

26:39.389 --> 26:40.808
Oh, don't mind Mr. Penge.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.143
He hates anything new
on principle.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.478
I was the youngest

26:44.645 --> 26:45.997
to ever make first footman
in Chatsworth,

26:46.021 --> 26:47.731
but here...

26:47.898 --> 26:49.608
It's not easy working here.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.026
Penge is a curmudgeon.

26:51.193 --> 26:54.029
The wages are terrible.

26:54.196 --> 26:55.739
But...

26:55.906 --> 26:59.827
When I'm with Her Majesty
doing her hair, well...

26:59.993 --> 27:02.913
She isn'tjust a lady of fashion.

27:03.080 --> 27:06.083
She relies on me
to look her best.

27:06.250 --> 27:10.003
And...

27:10.170 --> 27:13.048
Maybe it's silly, but...

27:13.215 --> 27:18.971
When I send her out there,
looking like a queen,

27:19.138 --> 27:21.890
I feel like I'm making
a little part of history.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.604
Um...

27:27.771 --> 27:30.107
Goose fat and white lead.

27:30.274 --> 27:31.775
That's what this wig needs.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.743
II'

27:53.839 --> 27:56.049
Shall I come back, ma'am?

27:56.216 --> 27:58.468
Do you think they hate me,
Skerrett?

27:58.635 --> 28:01.221
Who, ma'am?

28:01.388 --> 28:02.639
Chartists.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.975
Do they want to...

28:05.142 --> 28:08.645
cut off my head?

28:08.812 --> 28:09.897
Kill my children?

28:10.063 --> 28:11.523
Course they don't.

28:11.690 --> 28:15.861
Chartists are ordinary
working people, ma'am.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.321
Not murderers.

28:20.782 --> 28:23.952
I can introduce you to one,
if you like.

28:24.119 --> 28:28.040
She does some
of Your Majesty's embroidery.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.462
Victoria.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.175
Louis Philippe is arriving.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.386
Yes.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.643
II'

29:09.957 --> 29:13.752
II'

29:35.482 --> 29:38.193
II'

29:43.073 --> 29:44.866
I've been so cold.

29:45.033 --> 29:48.328
Thank you for taking me in.

29:48.495 --> 29:49.997
We are only repaying
your hospitality.

29:50.163 --> 29:51.290
You are welcome

29:51.456 --> 29:55.419
while you are considering
your future.

29:55.585 --> 29:57.963
Alas, I have no future.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.130
Like the prodigal son,

29:59.256 --> 30:03.010
I have squandered my patrimony,

30:03.176 --> 30:04.720
the love of my people.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.930
And your family?

30:08.223 --> 30:09.349
Scattered across Europe.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.812
Pray that I will live
to see them again.

30:13.979 --> 30:17.274
I do pray
I will see my family again.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.318
But at least I have
the consolation

30:19.484 --> 30:22.112
of my beloved sister.

30:26.867 --> 30:28.347
I hope I do not bring trouble
with me.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.288
Am not popular
wit your countrymen,

30:31.455 --> 30:33.707
<i>ma chÃ©re cousins.</i>

30:33.874 --> 30:34.916
You're our guest,

30:35.083 --> 30:36.752
Louis Philippe.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.587
That's all that matters.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.432
II'

31:27.928 --> 31:30.847
I don't want to be
the stupid king!

31:36.728 --> 31:37.479
Don't worry,

31:37.646 --> 31:39.106
I know Bertie's part.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.316
Oh. What a temper.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.735
He's just cross with himself.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.279
My son's the same...
He hates being in the wrong.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.327
Victoria,
he has to learn to control himself.

31:52.494 --> 31:54.413
He's passionate.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.374
Mama, Papa, I'm still
performing.

31:57.541 --> 31:58.792
LOUIS PHILIPPE: I'm listening,

31:58.959 --> 32:00.585
my little Jeanne d'Arc.

32:07.717 --> 32:09.511
Shall we go back onstage?

32:14.683 --> 32:17.936
If we are to act
against the Chartists,

32:18.103 --> 32:19.688
we will need evidence
of a conspiracy.

32:19.855 --> 32:22.065
Put agents in place

32:22.232 --> 32:23.376
after the riots, Prime Minister,

32:23.400 --> 32:26.111
but these things take time.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.113
We don't have time.
Just get the proof, man.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.240
Whatever it takes.

32:34.244 --> 32:37.914
I don't know why we don't
just lock them all up.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.875
If the crowds that cheer you on

32:40.041 --> 32:41.710
could hear you now.

32:41.877 --> 32:44.713
They know I'm a patriot first
and foremost, Russell.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.757
I wish you would call me
"Prime Minister."

32:47.924 --> 32:50.969
Liberty and confusion abroad,

32:51.136 --> 32:52.596
peace and stability at home.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.599
That's my motto...

32:55.765 --> 32:56.765
Prime Minister.

33:04.858 --> 33:06.085
We must be ready to take action,

33:06.109 --> 33:07.360
peaceably if we may,

33:07.527 --> 33:08.570
forcibly if we must.

33:08.737 --> 33:09.737
Yes.

33:09.863 --> 33:10.863
Eh, where do I sign?

33:13.200 --> 33:14.534
Just here, Mr...?

33:14.701 --> 33:17.037
Fitzgerald, Patrick Fitzgerald.

33:18.455 --> 33:20.874
What happened to your finger?

33:21.041 --> 33:23.335
I got too close
to an English musket.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.102
Fighting for my home,
I was being evicted

33:25.253 --> 33:27.839
so my Lord Wexfords cattle
could graze unimpeded.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.216
Hmm.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.468
We welcome our Irish brethren
to the cause,

33:31.635 --> 33:32.719
Mr. Fitzgerald.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.006
He has no right to be there!

33:34.137 --> 33:36.181
Yeah!

33:36.348 --> 33:37.849
The ruling class
can no longer prosper

33:38.016 --> 33:39.518
by trampling on working men.

33:39.684 --> 33:40.844
And what about working women?

33:40.894 --> 33:41.913
Do they not get trampled on,
too?

33:41.937 --> 33:44.064
Oh, they know
how to take care of themselves.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.360
Just make sure
that Palmerston is sat

33:48.527 --> 33:50.612
at the other end of the table.

33:50.779 --> 33:54.407
I don't want that awful,
booming voice in my ear.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.117
And do ask your husband, Sophie.

33:56.284 --> 33:58.495
He might be able to keep
the foreign secretary in check.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.622
And Feodora,

34:00.789 --> 34:02.165
you should sit next
to Palmerston.

34:02.332 --> 34:04.501
You can tell him
about your ordeal in Baden.

34:04.668 --> 34:05.961
You'll have to excuse me, Drina,

34:06.127 --> 34:08.672
but I have nothing suitable
to wear.

34:08.838 --> 34:11.424
Well, you must look
through some of my clothes.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.718
After all, I have no use
for them at the moment.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.137
You are so thoughtful, Drina,

34:16.304 --> 34:20.600
but don't you think the skirts
would be a little short?

34:23.478 --> 34:25.206
Well,
I suppose you're a little taller than me.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.565
Hmm.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.211
But perhaps
Skerrett can add a ruffle.

34:29.442 --> 34:30.842
She's so clever
at things like that.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.572
Hmm.

34:34.614 --> 34:38.660
II'

34:46.459 --> 34:47.711
Aunt Feo.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.966
Why are you making that face,
Aunt Feo?

34:55.594 --> 34:58.680
Lam remembering an old friend.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.348
A fat friend.

35:00.515 --> 35:04.519
That is your great-uncle
George, Bertie.

35:04.686 --> 35:07.022
We used to have tea together.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.358
And we would always have
meringues,

35:10.525 --> 35:12.861
because he knew they...

35:13.028 --> 35:14.696
They were my favorite.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.698
I love meringues.

35:16.865 --> 35:19.868
Hmm.

35:20.035 --> 35:22.954
One day, Bertie,
you will be a king,

35:23.121 --> 35:24.289
just like him.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.790
No, I won't,

35:25.957 --> 35:27.542
because in Britain,
we have queens.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.674
Would you like to be a queen,
Aunt Fee?

35:37.385 --> 35:38.887
What a funny boy you are.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.729
Skerrett.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.814
My sister wants
some new clothes.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.317
I thought perhaps

35:52.484 --> 35:54.152
you could alter some of mine.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.696
Certainly, ma'am.

35:56.863 --> 35:57.947
Who's this?

35:58.114 --> 35:59.866
May I present Abigail Turner.

36:00.033 --> 36:01.785
I mentioned her to you
yesterday.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.996
Miss Turner is acquainted
with the Chartists, ma'am.

36:07.624 --> 36:10.293
My ministers tell me
you want to get rid of me

36:10.460 --> 36:11.544
and found a republic.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.130
No, Your Majesty.

36:14.297 --> 36:15.840
We want justice,

36:16.007 --> 36:17.801
not revolution. Really?

36:17.967 --> 36:19.678
Well, the quarrel, ma'am,

36:19.844 --> 36:21.262
is not with you,

36:21.429 --> 36:23.115
but with a government
that gives the working man

36:23.139 --> 36:24.349
no voice in his own affairs.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.851
Haw bald ynu are, Miss Turner.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.937
Well, my father used to say

36:29.104 --> 36:30.539
my tongue was sharper
than my needle,

36:30.563 --> 36:34.359
but I mean no disrespect,
Your Majesty.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.779
Well, I shall take you
at your word.

36:37.946 --> 36:41.199
But only because
Skerrett has vouched for you.

36:44.119 --> 36:46.955
II'

36:50.125 --> 36:51.626
Ma'am.

37:03.012 --> 37:06.683
How are you finding
your duties, my dear?

37:06.850 --> 37:08.226
Not too taxing, 1 hope-.

37:08.393 --> 37:12.063
I think the queen finds me
satisfactory.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.232
In fact, she gave me this. Hmm.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.234
Fetching.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.778
What a shame
you're wearing it incorrectly.

37:18.945 --> 37:21.364
Sophie, the queen asked me

37:21.531 --> 37:23.658
if you'd look over
the place cards.

37:23.825 --> 37:27.078
She says you are so good
at these things.

37:29.456 --> 37:32.375
Just so you know,
there is no correct place

37:32.542 --> 37:34.182
for you to wear the brooch
from the queen.

37:34.294 --> 37:37.380
Did you know that my father
was once a shopkeeper?

37:37.547 --> 37:39.048
Really?

37:39.215 --> 37:41.415
Mine was a parson, but I try
not to hold it against him.

37:41.551 --> 37:45.054
What a lucky man you are,
Monmouth.

37:45.221 --> 37:47.891
And she's as rich
as Croesus, too, I hear.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.559
I don't need reminding

37:49.726 --> 37:52.312
that her family are little more
than grocers, Palmerston.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.289
The famous Lord Palmerston,

38:11.456 --> 38:16.211
who was so quick to acknowledge
the new republic.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.505
I congratulated
the new government

38:18.671 --> 38:20.089
on resolving a period of...

38:20.256 --> 38:22.258
instability.

38:22.425 --> 38:24.177
You know,

38:24.344 --> 38:26.679
if I was not a Frenchman,

38:26.846 --> 38:29.641
should wish to be an Englishman.

38:31.059 --> 38:32.769
And if were? Not %an Englishman,

38:32.936 --> 38:34.604
should wish to be...

38:34.771 --> 38:35.772
an Englishman.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.738
Prime Minister. Ma'am.

38:43.905 --> 38:45.323
Duke.

38:45.490 --> 38:48.368
You must forgive me for stealing
your wife from you.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.495
She's such a charming companion.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.498
I'm delighted
that you think so, ma'am.

38:57.794 --> 38:59.963
II'

39:10.515 --> 39:13.643
Feodora!

39:13.810 --> 39:15.520
How... different you look.

39:17.605 --> 39:21.109
It's funny, when we lived
at Kensington,

39:21.276 --> 39:23.069
you used to wear my clothes,

39:23.236 --> 39:25.363
and new am wearing yours.

39:28.616 --> 39:31.494
Louis Philippe, will you take
my sister into dinner?

39:34.163 --> 39:37.083
There is some consolation
in exile after all.

39:54.017 --> 39:55.737
I think we'll have over
a million signatures

39:55.852 --> 39:57.372
by the time we take this
to Parliament.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.564
If we ever get there.
Of course we will.

40:01.482 --> 40:03.985
The government would like
to ban us completely.

40:04.152 --> 40:05.486
And if Cuffay starts a riot

40:05.653 --> 40:07.548
because the French king
is staying with the queen,

40:07.572 --> 40:09.198
they won't hesitate.

40:09.365 --> 40:10.801
Well, surely Cuffay
is not stupid enough

40:10.825 --> 40:12.952
to go to the palace.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.412
Isn't he?

41:02.585 --> 41:05.463
How long will the king be
staying with you, ma'am?

41:05.630 --> 41:08.091
For as long as he needs to.

41:09.842 --> 41:13.513
I appreciate your loyalty
to a fellow sovereign.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.765
1 just hope there
are no? Repercussions.

41:15.932 --> 41:17.725
There is no danger of that.

41:17.892 --> 41:20.186
I know where my duty lies...
My people know that.

41:20.353 --> 41:21.729
Oh, I hope so.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.356
These days you can't
be too careful

41:23.523 --> 41:25.316
with the company you keep.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.486
Indeed I can't, Lord Palmerston.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.238
It appears that diplomacy

41:30.405 --> 41:33.032
is not one of your talents,
Foreign Secretary.

41:33.199 --> 41:36.661
Perhaps, but patriotism is.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.330
I would hate to see the queen

41:39.497 --> 41:41.582
suffer the same fate
as her guest.

41:41.749 --> 41:44.919
And you dare to say that to me.

41:45.086 --> 41:47.797
Public opinion
is a fickle beast.

41:47.964 --> 41:50.341
If the queen continues to
surround herself with...

41:50.508 --> 41:53.177
foreigners,

41:53.344 --> 41:55.263
I can't be answerable
for the consequences.

41:56.514 --> 41:57.598
That's enough.

42:23.916 --> 42:26.961
II'

42:32.091 --> 42:34.093
Hello again.

42:34.260 --> 42:35.887
Can I help you with that?

42:36.054 --> 42:38.639
What have you got in there?
Gold bullion?

42:38.806 --> 42:40.475
Her Majesty's undergarments,

42:40.641 --> 42:41.641
if you please.

42:41.684 --> 42:42.684
Working for the queen?

42:42.727 --> 42:44.812
And you a Chartist?

42:44.979 --> 42:46.790
The Chartists have no quarrel
with Her Majesty.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.483
And the work's well paid.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.234
I wish there was more of it.

42:50.401 --> 42:52.653
Well, I'm surprised a
fine-looking woman like you

42:52.820 --> 42:54.460
doesn't have a husband
to provide for her.

42:56.657 --> 43:01.287
The franchise comes first,
Mr. Fitzgerald.

43:01.454 --> 43:03.790
I want to marry a free man.

43:11.923 --> 43:14.842
"A vote for every man
over 21 years of age of sound mind

43:15.009 --> 43:17.303
"and not undergoing punishment
for crime.

43:17.470 --> 43:18.846
Payment for members
of Parliament."

43:19.013 --> 43:21.474
Perhaps I will run
in the next election.

43:21.641 --> 43:23.935
Hear ye, hear ye!

43:24.102 --> 43:25.728
The Honorable Archibald Brodie.

43:25.895 --> 43:27.522
"One man, one vote" indeed.

43:27.688 --> 43:30.566
If you want mob rule,
go live in France.

43:30.733 --> 43:33.194
Do you have the vote, Mr. Penge?

43:33.361 --> 43:35.780
I think a man like yourself
is worthy of a say

43:35.947 --> 43:37.627
in the management
of his country's affairs.

43:55.633 --> 43:56.884
Thank you, Mr. Francatelli.

43:57.051 --> 44:00.221
The world is changing,
Mr. Penge.

44:04.058 --> 44:06.978
I'm afraid
Lord Palmerston is right.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.330
I have brought you
nothing but trouble.

44:08.354 --> 44:09.564
Absolutely not.

44:09.730 --> 44:11.524
If anyone has brought trouble,
it's...

44:11.691 --> 44:12.900
Lord Palmerston.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.906
Victoria, it is from Leopold.

44:19.073 --> 44:22.952
He is in OstendÂ» the revolution
has spread to Belgium.

44:23.119 --> 44:24.930
I think it is time that
we left for the Isle of Wight.

44:24.954 --> 44:26.754
Osborne House is ready now,
we can head there.

44:26.914 --> 44:28.666
I'm not going to run away.

44:28.833 --> 44:32.086
You should listen to your
husband, ma chÃ©re.

44:32.253 --> 44:35.840
My father lost his head
to Madame La Guillotine.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.717
{want you to share the
{same fate-

44:37.884 --> 44:40.678
The Chartists want the vote.

44:40.845 --> 44:42.430
Not a republic.

44:42.597 --> 44:43.931
Well, how can you be so sure?

44:44.098 --> 44:46.058
Because we are English, Albert.

44:46.225 --> 44:48.269
We may grumble, we may protest.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.355
We are not
a revolutionary people.

44:59.614 --> 45:02.283
The French king is eating
roast beef in the palace.

45:03.409 --> 45:04.609
But he should be in the Tower!

45:06.871 --> 45:08.456
Say we should rectify
the situation}.

45:10.750 --> 45:12.793
It's the drink talking,
Samuel Cuffay!

45:12.960 --> 45:15.087
Remember what Mr. UConnor says!

45:15.254 --> 45:17.381
We're a movement, not a mob!

45:17.548 --> 45:20.176
That's why the French
have a republic

45:20.343 --> 45:21.570
and we have a charter. Go home!

45:21.594 --> 45:22.929
And sleep it off, Cuffay.

45:24.430 --> 45:25.681
Vive la republic!

45:25.848 --> 45:27.767
Would you like me
to keep an eye on him?

45:27.934 --> 45:29.203
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

45:29.227 --> 45:31.312
You can rely on me, Ms. Turner.

45:32.855 --> 45:35.358
To the palace! To the palace!

45:56.462 --> 45:58.631
Do you know how to play?

45:58.798 --> 46:01.717
The evenings are long
in Langenburg.

46:01.884 --> 46:05.304
Oh, I would be delighted
to have an opponent.

46:12.186 --> 46:15.314
I really am sorry
that your first visit

46:15.481 --> 46:18.567
is at such a difficult time.

46:18.734 --> 46:21.237
Victoria should have
asked you sooner.

46:21.404 --> 46:23.864
I am just happy to be here.

46:24.031 --> 46:25.992
At last.

46:26.158 --> 46:30.621
I want so much to be of use.

46:30.788 --> 46:34.208
Well, in that case, you can help
me try and persuade Victoria

46:34.375 --> 46:35.584
to go to Osborne.

46:35.751 --> 46:38.296
She is, um...

46:38.462 --> 46:40.381
rather stubborn.

46:40.548 --> 46:41.340
Stubborn.

46:41.507 --> 46:43.467
I see it in Bertie, also.

46:43.634 --> 46:47.179
But can sen Bertie to the
nursery when he has a tantrum-.

46:48.931 --> 46:52.768
Victoria is lucky
to have a husband like you.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.275
Check.

46:59.442 --> 47:01.152
I can see you are,

47:01.319 --> 47:05.281
as the English say,
beating me at my own game.

47:17.126 --> 47:21.047
There are police reports
of rioting

47:21.213 --> 47:22.673
connected with the...

47:22.840 --> 47:24.526
He was a thorn in your side
when he was king of France.

47:24.550 --> 47:27.011
He's causing you more trouble
now he's here.

47:27.178 --> 47:29.096
You should never have
let him come.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.682
You, Lord Palmerston, are quick
to applaud revolution abroad,

47:31.849 --> 47:34.009
but what have you done for
the workers of this country?

47:35.644 --> 47:38.044
Do you ever deign to look out of
the window of your carriage?

47:39.231 --> 47:41.233
This country needs more
than blusterÂ»

47:41.400 --> 47:42.902
it needs change.

47:43.069 --> 47:45.071
I think the Chartists might
agree with you, sir.

47:45.237 --> 47:46.614
Lord Palmerston.

47:48.741 --> 47:52.119
You have my permission
to withd raw.

47:53.621 --> 47:55.998
II'

48:14.850 --> 48:17.645
I cannot tolerate that man
anylongen

48:17.812 --> 48:20.106
Russell, of course I believe

48:20.272 --> 48:22.108
in a constitutional monarchy,

48:22.274 --> 48:23.526
but this must not continue.

48:23.692 --> 48:26.821
Such a man is not fit
to be foreign secretary.

48:26.987 --> 48:29.031
You must dismiss him.

48:30.366 --> 48:33.411
If only I could, ma'am.

48:33.577 --> 48:36.831
II'

48:36.997 --> 48:38.374
Did she call for my head?

48:38.541 --> 48:39.821
The queen said
she would be happy

48:39.875 --> 48:41.210
to accept your resignation.

48:41.377 --> 48:42.711
And you had to tell her

48:42.878 --> 48:44.356
that even though
you'd like nothing better

48:44.380 --> 48:45.631
than to be rid of me,

48:45.798 --> 48:47.299
you need my support
in the Commons.

48:47.466 --> 48:49.069
Otherwise, you will be defeated
in the next vote.

48:49.093 --> 48:51.303
Good evening, Duchess...
Where are you off to?

48:51.470 --> 48:52.930
Lord Palmerston, Prime Minister.

48:53.097 --> 48:54.682
Duchess.

48:54.849 --> 48:56.225
I am just on my way home.

48:56.392 --> 48:57.685
Alone? Where's Monmouth?

48:57.852 --> 48:59.353
At his club, I imagine.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.689
Isn't that where men of fashion
go at this hour?

49:01.856 --> 49:02.940
I wouldn't.

49:03.107 --> 49:04.900
Perhaps I should take you.

49:05.067 --> 49:06.193
You shall do no such thing.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.946
We have to go back to the House.

49:09.113 --> 49:10.739
And the duchess should may here.

49:10.906 --> 49:13.617
The streets are not safe.

49:13.784 --> 49:16.162
My master has spoken.

49:16.328 --> 49:17.496
Another time, perhaps.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.839
Please see this is taken
to my room.

49:27.006 --> 49:29.508
With pleasure, Your Grace.

49:35.639 --> 49:39.393
She's a duchess,
and you're a footman.

49:39.560 --> 49:42.438
<i>Murmur one.</i>

49:42.605 --> 49:45.274
You're not at Chatsworth
anymore, Joseph.

49:45.441 --> 49:47.860
You'll do well to remember that.

49:48.027 --> 49:50.070
Understood, Mr. Penge.

49:55.201 --> 49:56.869
I'd like to send him
to the Tower!

49:57.036 --> 49:58.579
Yes, but on one point,
he was right.

49:58.746 --> 50:00.539
This situation is too unstable.

50:00.706 --> 50:02.166
We must leave London.

50:02.333 --> 50:04.251
I have told you, Albert,
I will not run away!

50:04.418 --> 50:07.129
Wellington would call it
a tactical retreat!

50:07.296 --> 50:10.174
The Chartists are angry,
Victoria, and rightly so!

50:10.341 --> 50:12.426
The ruling class
have failed them.

50:12.593 --> 50:14.178
This is a time of revolution,

50:14.345 --> 50:16.889
and we are vulnerable.

50:17.056 --> 50:18.807
I do not wish to scare you,

50:18.974 --> 50:20.684
but when think of the future...

50:20.851 --> 50:23.437
We have no choice.

50:25.856 --> 50:27.149
We will leave tomorrow.

50:28.734 --> 50:30.694
II'

50:35.032 --> 50:37.826
Rise up... vive la republic!

50:37.993 --> 50:40.287
Vive la republic!

50:43.499 --> 50:46.418
II'

50:51.632 --> 50:54.260
We've found a hotel.

50:54.426 --> 50:57.471
Now it's time we set a date.

50:57.638 --> 50:59.515
I thought the queen
would be safe.

51:01.058 --> 51:02.351
I can't leave her now.

51:02.518 --> 51:03.537
She needs me. No, no, darling.

51:03.561 --> 51:06.146
She employs you.

51:06.313 --> 51:09.316
I'm the one that needs you.

51:09.483 --> 51:10.818
So much.

51:14.530 --> 51:16.991
II'

51:22.705 --> 51:25.624
Vive Ia republic!
Vive la republic!

51:30.170 --> 51:32.631
We should take the train
tomorrow morning.

51:32.798 --> 51:35.259
Please ensure
the household is ready.

51:35.426 --> 51:36.552
Yes, sir.

51:38.387 --> 51:40.639
Liebes, are you all right?

51:40.806 --> 51:42.683
Are you hurt? Raise the alarm!

51:44.852 --> 51:46.103
My love, we must go.

51:47.354 --> 51:49.690
We must go now!

51:49.857 --> 51:50.941
Now!

51:51.108 --> 51:53.902
No, Albert, not now.

51:57.323 --> 51:58.449
My waters...

51:58.616 --> 52:00.200
Albert...

52:01.827 --> 52:04.204
Everything will be all right.

52:04.371 --> 52:05.789
II'

52:14.715 --> 52:18.594
Vive Ia republic!
Vive la republic!

52:23.307 --> 52:24.558
Get back!

52:25.684 --> 52:27.227
Get away from the fence!

52:30.648 --> 52:31.648
Get back!

52:33.108 --> 52:35.069
What's happening?

52:35.235 --> 52:38.030
Barbarians are
at the gate, Your Grace.

52:38.197 --> 52:39.907
<i>Mon die...</i>

52:40.074 --> 52:42.368
Sir, I don't think
it's safe for you to be here.

53:28.789 --> 53:31.417
II'

53:35.713 --> 53:37.840
Death to the queen!
