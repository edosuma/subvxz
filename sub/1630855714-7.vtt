08:14.828 --> 08:16.797
which is basically impossible
in Jersey.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.200
This really seems like
a normal house, um,

08:20.233 --> 08:22.636
which would be bad if we just
broke into it, right?

08:22.669 --> 08:23.804
-[Archer] Oh, my God!
-What?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.239
I just remembered!

08:25.272 --> 08:26.240
Frank Sinatra
is from New Jersey.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.508
How could that be?

08:27.541 --> 08:29.543
Please remember
that I'm monitoring you,

08:29.576 --> 08:31.745
so stay on task
in a professional manner.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.681
[Archer] This is
my professional manner.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.816
Ms. Kane,
I brought you some nourishment

08:35.849 --> 08:37.785
so you can keep your
strength up for the big battle.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.620
Cheryl, the whole point
of all of this

08:39.653 --> 08:41.589
is to avoid a big battle.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.424
We can finally get off
the treadmill of mediocrity

08:43.457 --> 08:45.626
because we won't have
a huge mess to clean up.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.795
No, I meant the worker battle
I've been planning

08:47.828 --> 08:49.530
for when we're done
with all this.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.764
It's to the death!

08:50.797 --> 08:52.800
-Of course it is.
-Or...

08:52.833 --> 08:54.802
I could find the button
that can kill on command.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.638
Like...

08:57.671 --> 08:58.672
-this one!
-[buzzer blares]

08:58.705 --> 09:00.174
What did you do?

09:00.207 --> 09:01.542
What was necessary.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.544
No, something happened
to one of the agents.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.113
Their blood pressure spiked.
They might've been shot.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.616
Is everyone okay?
Teams, check in now!

09:08.649 --> 09:10.651
Team Ballsfor in position
with the mainframe.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.219
Yeah, because I found it.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.654
Yeah, congrats, Ray.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.489
You spotted the door
marked "mainframe."

09:15.522 --> 09:17.558
Which was in English.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.560
We're good too.
Coming up on the mainframe now.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.728
[Krieger]
Although we are walking a path

09:20.761 --> 09:22.096
the Mayans once believed

09:22.129 --> 09:24.164
was a gateway
to the underworld,

09:24.197 --> 09:26.333
so if this all ends
in a sacrificial death,

09:26.366 --> 09:27.601
we'll be honoring tradition.

09:27.634 --> 09:29.303
Well, then whose
blood pressure is--

09:29.336 --> 09:31.138
Cyril, what the hell happened?

09:31.171 --> 09:33.340
Oh, God.
We're going to jail for life.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.075
Oh, my God.
Oh, I can't breathe.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.343
Okay,
so if the house is a decoy

09:36.376 --> 09:37.745
and you're under fire,
we can--

09:37.778 --> 09:40.281
[Archer] Oh, boy.
W-we're gonna need to hold.

09:40.314 --> 09:42.583
Hold? God, Archer.
What did you do?

09:42.616 --> 09:44.318
[Archer]
This one isn't on me.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.587
[Cyril whimpering]

09:46.620 --> 09:48.289
If you guys are here
to kill me,

09:48.322 --> 09:49.657
I'd really appreciate
you letting me

09:49.690 --> 09:51.525
clear my browser history
first.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.393
-[Cyril gasps]
-[Archer chuckles]

09:58.165 --> 09:59.266
[Lana] Cyril, your biometrics
are all over the place.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.335
-You need to calm down.
-Calm down?

10:01.368 --> 10:04.238
We are grown men who just broke
into a teenage boy's bedroom

10:04.271 --> 10:05.606
in the middle of the night!

10:05.639 --> 10:07.274
Cyril,
you didn't even do anything.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.243
I'm the only one this kid'll
bring up in therapy one day.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.477
Right, kid?

10:10.510 --> 10:12.613
-I mean, yeah, probably.
-See?

10:12.646 --> 10:14.682
-Brag much?
-This is just a small hiccup.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.383
It doesn't take us off mission.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.152
I don't see what
you're worried about, Lana.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.088
We pretty much usually always
complete missions successfully.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.222
Sometimes.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.357
-Often.
-[Zara] Wow,

10:23.390 --> 10:24.758
a lot of modifiers there.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.094
Yeah, and we always
cause a giant mess

10:27.127 --> 10:29.430
and get all the blowback,
but not this time.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.533
So, Cyril, you need
to calm down and focus!

10:32.566 --> 10:34.335
This is like Cheetah Scouts
all over again.

10:34.368 --> 10:35.769
You think it's your new start,

10:35.802 --> 10:38.138
but it's actually a portal
to unimaginable horror.

10:38.171 --> 10:41.075
Ugh, my mom is so desperate
for me to join Cheetah Scouts.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.476
-Ugh.
-Oh, God.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.744
Oh, God.
They thought I was cool

10:43.777 --> 10:45.246
at my first Cheetah Scouts
meeting,

10:45.279 --> 10:46.213
but then they found out.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.481
They found out!

10:47.514 --> 10:49.083
Oh, wow, Cyril
seems to be having

10:49.116 --> 10:50.618
some kind of painful flashback.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.152
Permission to mercy-shoot him?

10:52.185 --> 10:53.687
What's the holdup here?
We're in position,

10:53.720 --> 10:55.756
but someone will find
those knocked-out guards soon.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.791
And if I were team leader,
I would've hid those bodies.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.226
[mockingly]
Well, pretty convenient

10:59.259 --> 11:00.628
you're just saying that now!

11:00.661 --> 11:03.097
Listen to me! This mission
is not falling apart!

11:03.130 --> 11:04.431
-Not on my watch!
-[Cheryl] Yeah!

11:04.464 --> 11:06.500
We don't know the meaning
of the word "hubris"!

11:06.533 --> 11:08.102
Archer,
can you find the mainframe

11:08.135 --> 11:10.070
while the other teams
are still in position?

11:10.103 --> 11:11.538
Well, it's not in this room,
unless it looks like

11:11.571 --> 11:13.641
the Time Life subscription
to being a virgin.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.809
-[Krieger] Dibs!
-A virgin with a hot mom.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.244
[Krieger] Oh. Pass.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.213
Wow. Hey, Trev.
Uh, what's her deal?

11:19.246 --> 11:20.347
[Zara]
Is now the time for this?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.082
It might be.
I mean, what if she's

11:22.115 --> 11:24.251
-dating right now or--
-For the love of God,

11:24.284 --> 11:25.619
stop with the crosstalk!

11:25.652 --> 11:27.354
[Pam] Then why
can we hear each other?

11:27.387 --> 11:29.757
I don't know.
Why can they, Greg?

11:29.790 --> 11:30.824
[Trevor] Hey, listen.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.359
If you guys are here about...

11:32.392 --> 11:33.794
[whispering]
...Dragon Run...

11:33.827 --> 11:35.296
[normally] ...I set up
the mainframe in the basement.

11:35.329 --> 11:36.697
Wow, a teen hacker.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.633
I read about that
in Overused Trope Magazine.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.468
Dude, it was just
an after-school hobby.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.203
Yeah, buying
and selling illegal goods

11:43.236 --> 11:45.139
looks great
on a college application.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.774
I don't even want to be a part
of it anymore.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.410
Oh, did you not find a world
of ones and zeroes comforting

11:49.443 --> 11:51.612
in the face
of your disgusting hormones?

11:51.645 --> 11:54.682
Or did the girl you wanted to
impress not think it was cool?

11:54.715 --> 11:56.784
-That's not what happened.
-Really?

11:56.817 --> 11:58.619
-Who's your best friend?
-Laura.

11:58.652 --> 12:00.220
But that's different, dude,

12:00.253 --> 12:01.488
because I just have
to stick around long enough

12:01.521 --> 12:03.090
for her to realize
she really likes me.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.391
-I rest my case.
-All right.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.160
I promise I will show you
to the basement

12:06.193 --> 12:08.796
and the mainframe if you
promise not to tell my mom.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.365
She would be so mad at me.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.834
Oh, God, it's knot-tying
all over again!

12:13.867 --> 12:15.803
Also, you have to promise
not to date my mom.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.404
-[Cyril whimpering]
-Uh...

12:17.437 --> 12:18.405
[Lana] Oh, my God, Archer,

12:18.438 --> 12:19.473
tell him that's fine,

12:19.506 --> 12:21.208
and get down there now!

12:21.241 --> 12:22.610
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Lana,

12:22.643 --> 12:23.677
let's not get ahead
of ourselves here.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.379
Archer, I swear to God!

12:25.412 --> 12:27.514
And she is God!

12:27.547 --> 12:29.216
Fine!
Cyril, get the kid.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.417
Just grabbing a kid
and taking him

12:30.450 --> 12:32.353
into a basement--
totally normal.

12:32.386 --> 12:34.755
How long is this hold lasting?
We've got incoming guards.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.490
[Lana] You are supposed to be
on top of this, Greg!

12:36.523 --> 12:38.125
[Greg] I am?
-[Lana] That is what this

12:38.158 --> 12:40.261
control center
is supposed to be for!

12:40.294 --> 12:42.096
To handle any crisis
that comes up

12:42.129 --> 12:43.697
before it becomes a disaster!

12:43.730 --> 12:45.299
Um, speaking of crisis,

12:45.332 --> 12:47.534
none of these photos
seems to include a dad.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.503
He, uh, died when I was a kid.

12:49.536 --> 12:52.072
Oh, wow, tough break.
I'm so sorry.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.674
I grew up without a dad too.

12:53.707 --> 12:56.243
Uh, unrelated, did he die
from something contagious

12:56.276 --> 12:57.378
that your mom might have?

12:57.411 --> 12:58.412
That's not unrelated.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.613
Let him answer, Cyril!

12:59.646 --> 13:01.482
Archer, stop trying
to bang his mom!

13:01.515 --> 13:03.350
Greg, why haven't you pulled up
the warehouse cameras?

13:03.383 --> 13:04.752
Because you didn't tell me to.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.287
Greg, you have one job!

13:06.320 --> 13:07.755
Oh, is it reading your mind?

13:07.788 --> 13:09.556
-[static crackles]
-[Lana] Thank you!

13:09.589 --> 13:11.158
-Now we can finally--
-[power whirs off]

13:11.191 --> 13:12.359
wait, what?
What's happening?

13:12.392 --> 13:13.794
Is this
a cyberattack retaliation?

13:13.827 --> 13:15.663
Uh, I think this is what

13:15.696 --> 13:17.398
the electrician meant
when he was all...

13:17.431 --> 13:19.133
[with New York accent]
..."Blah, blah, blah,

13:19.166 --> 13:21.335
"this control center uses a lot
of power, blah, blah, blah.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.203
The building
isn't built for it, blah."

13:23.236 --> 13:25.239
What?
Why didn't you tell me that?

13:25.272 --> 13:27.107
[normally] You know
what electricians are like.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.342
They'll say anything.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.477
That is not
a recognized stereotype.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.779
Can anyone at least hear us?

13:31.812 --> 13:33.647
The console needs
a couple minutes to reboot,

13:33.680 --> 13:36.350
but we can get audio.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.219
[Pam grunting]
Son of a bitch.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.487
[Lana] Team Ballsfor, report.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.755
[Archer]
Yeah, how's it hangin'?

13:41.788 --> 13:43.090
-[Lana] Damn it, Greg!
-[Pam] Hold!

13:43.123 --> 13:45.092
We need to hold, damn it!

13:45.125 --> 13:48.362
[speaking Japanese]

13:48.395 --> 13:49.763
[grunts]

13:49.796 --> 13:51.365
[Ray]
Good thing you speak Japanese.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.233
Okay, we need
to keep everyone in position

13:53.266 --> 13:55.236
until the control center
comes back on,

13:55.269 --> 13:57.738
which had better be
goddamn soon, Greg.

13:57.771 --> 13:58.806
-[Zara yelps]
-[wings flapping]

13:58.839 --> 14:00.207
[Zara]
God, they're everywhere!

14:00.240 --> 14:02.276
Oh, God!
The bats are everywhere!

14:02.309 --> 14:04.211
Come on, the ultrasound
turned off too?

14:04.244 --> 14:05.613
[Zara] No shit!

14:05.646 --> 14:07.081
I knew you people
would get me killed!

14:07.114 --> 14:09.083
How hard is it
to stick to a plan?

14:09.116 --> 14:11.518
[Krieger] The bats always said
they'd get their revenge!

14:11.551 --> 14:16.490
[bellowing] Vengeance, thy name
is tadarida brasiliensis!

14:16.523 --> 14:18.259
[Archer] Huh, sounds like this
mission would've been easier

14:18.292 --> 14:19.793
without the control center
at all.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.496
No, this control center
is the only thing

14:22.529 --> 14:24.698
-that is keeping this all...
-[power whirs on]

14:24.731 --> 14:26.367
...working!
Finally!

14:26.400 --> 14:27.735
Now, I can see everything
that's...

14:27.768 --> 14:29.370
[grunting]

14:29.403 --> 14:32.139
-Hyah!
-[grunts]

14:32.172 --> 14:33.607
[Zara and Krieger crying]

14:33.640 --> 14:36.610
...going horribly wrong!
Oh, my God!

14:36.643 --> 14:38.646
Okay, guys,
I need you to listen!

14:38.679 --> 14:40.648
[Zara] We need to hold!
God, is this what hell is like?

14:40.681 --> 14:42.283
Ow!
Pretty close!

14:42.316 --> 14:45.219
Wait, are Archer and Cyril
actually in position?

14:45.252 --> 14:46.487
Yes, Lana,
because we didn't need

14:46.520 --> 14:48.622
that unnecessary
control center.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.257
But I wouldn't mind
the footage from this

14:50.290 --> 14:52.793
if those photos are the closest
I'm getting to that mom.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.495
Actually,
I'll just take a photo.

14:54.528 --> 14:56.263
Actually,
I'll just sleep with her.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.765
No!
You promised.

14:57.798 --> 15:00.100
I promised not to date her,
Trevor.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.769
For a teenager helping run
a black market,

15:01.802 --> 15:03.270
you should be more aware
of treachery.

15:03.303 --> 15:04.772
Remember this lesson.

15:04.805 --> 15:07.074
We can use the control center
for the other agents.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.342
Greg,
turn the ultrasound back on,

15:08.375 --> 15:09.476
and then tap
into the warehouse feed

15:09.509 --> 15:11.145
to divert attention away
from Ray and Pam.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.513
-[stomach gurgling]
-[retches]

15:12.546 --> 15:15.282
-Hey, Greg, where are you--
-[all retching]

15:18.719 --> 15:20.087
Yes, Ms. Kane?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.755
Where did you get
that party sub?

15:21.788 --> 15:23.691
Duh, from the party sub store.

15:23.724 --> 15:25.125
I bought it last week
and kept it under my desk

15:25.158 --> 15:26.293
so I wouldn't forget it.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.761
But you didn't eat any of it?

15:27.794 --> 15:30.297
Of course not.
In solidarity with you.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.665
Plus, it smelled so weird.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.567

15:33.600 --> 15:36.337
Pam, please tell me
you and Ray handled the guards.

15:36.370 --> 15:37.638
[Pam] Yes, but we need to hold.

15:37.671 --> 15:38.672
[Lana] Why?

15:38.705 --> 15:40.474
I gotta drain the clam.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.077
Unless the control center
can empty my bladder.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.044
Can it?

15:49.216 --> 15:50.584
Cheryl, did you get the
ultrasonic cloaking back up

15:50.617 --> 15:52.586
so the bats stop attacking
Team Stiletto?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.255
Yes, by which I mean no

15:54.288 --> 15:56.490
because I don't know what
anything you just said means!

15:56.523 --> 15:59.093
The control panel manual
said it was user-friendly.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.729
Where did Greg put
the damn manual? Greg!

16:01.762 --> 16:03.631
Hearing this isn't inspiring
a lot of confidence.

16:03.664 --> 16:05.366
Please tell me you have
a backup plan.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.667
Ugh, uh, Krieger,

16:06.700 --> 16:08.369
do you know anything
about this system?

16:08.402 --> 16:09.370
[Krieger] That depends.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.205
Is it a model 27-0,

16:11.238 --> 16:13.374
or is it a model 27-Y?

16:13.407 --> 16:15.209
I-I-I don't know.
Neither?

16:15.242 --> 16:16.343
[Krieger] Oh, good,
'cause I was bluffing.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.511

16:17.544 --> 16:20.381
Um, what's going on here?

16:20.414 --> 16:22.049

16:22.082 --> 16:23.517

and that you're with the--

16:35.529 --> 16:36.630

Archer, no.

Where's the nuclear button?

16:40.534 --> 16:42.336
Did you say Cheetah Scouts?

16:42.369 --> 16:45.205
Of course. I'm your son's
new Cheetah Scouts leader.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.474
Right, and I'm his
assistant scout leader.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.742

in charge of knots.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.211
Uh, but don't ask me

16:51.244 --> 16:52.513
Yeah, and we're here in our

16:52.546 --> 16:54.348

Cheetah Scouts uniforms

16:54.381 --> 16:58.619
to welcome your son
to Troop, uh, 333.

16:58.652 --> 17:00.254
Right, right.
That--that's why they're here.

17:03.824 --> 17:06.226
Or you could just
not say anything at all, kiddo.

17:06.259 --> 17:09.330
Well, that is...

17:09.363 --> 17:11.465

Oh, I'm so relieved.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.735
When Trevor had me buy him
this fancy video game stuff,

17:14.768 --> 17:18.339
I was afraid he'd never
do anything active again.

17:18.372 --> 17:20.474
Well, Cheetah Scouts
is very active.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.210
Some might say too active.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.246
And you don't have
to say anything either,

17:25.279 --> 17:27.481

17:27.514 --> 17:30.084
Well, thank God you two
are in his life now.

17:30.117 --> 17:32.486
He could really use
some father figures.

17:32.519 --> 17:33.754
Mom.

17:33.787 --> 17:35.589
Hey, I grew up
without a father,

17:35.622 --> 17:38.359
so I get that more than anyone.

17:38.392 --> 17:42.496
I guess you guys actually
handled that, uh, not terribly.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.765
And they didn't need you
or the center at all.

17:44.798 --> 17:47.334
You were totally useless.
Isn't that great?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.036
Right.
Yeah.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.704
Well, if you two aren't busy,

17:50.737 --> 17:52.573
any chance we could get
a heads-up

17:52.606 --> 17:55.075
the next time dozens of guards
are coming our way?

17:55.108 --> 17:56.510
[Lana]
Ray, what's going on there?

17:56.543 --> 17:58.646
Well, Team Leader Pam
thought it would be a good idea

17:58.679 --> 18:01.048
to stash the guards
we knocked out in the closet.

18:01.081 --> 18:02.616
Ray, that was your idea.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.618

-Oh, right.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.220

Everyone needs to get
their thumb drive in,

18:07.120 --> 18:08.589
or we'll be compromised.

18:08.622 --> 18:10.190
[grunts] It'd be great
if some attention

18:10.223 --> 18:11.458
could be placed on getting us
to the mainframe

18:11.491 --> 18:12.493
without bat rabies.

18:12.526 --> 18:13.761
You can just say "rabies."

18:13.794 --> 18:16.230
[sighs] Okay,
since I clearly don't know

18:16.263 --> 18:17.798
how to work this center
and some of you seem to be

18:17.831 --> 18:19.366
just fine without it,

18:19.399 --> 18:21.235
Krieger, how would you
get through the bats

18:21.268 --> 18:23.437
if you were just... [sighs]
...on your own?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.572
Oh, that's allowed?
Well, I'll be right back.

-Oh, my God, Krieger just

18:28.275 --> 18:29.610
pulled out this giant
electric light thing.

18:29.643 --> 18:31.445
Oh, my God,
he's going after the bats.

18:31.478 --> 18:33.380
It's brilliant!

18:33.413 --> 18:35.182
It's like watching a ballet,
but instead of stupid dancing,

18:35.215 --> 18:36.617
it's fighting off bats.

18:36.650 --> 18:38.719
God, there's someone competent
at this agency,

18:38.752 --> 18:40.387
and it's Krieger.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.489
His personal backup plan
is so unique,

18:42.522 --> 18:44.224
it could not have been
centrally planned.

18:44.257 --> 18:47.194
Watching this
is an unforgettable moment.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.629
Anyone who doesn't see this

18:48.662 --> 18:51.732
has a worse life
for having missed it.

18:51.765 --> 18:53.767
It's always going
to be a mess, isn't it?

18:53.800 --> 18:56.203
I will never be able
to control it.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.172
You mean IBS?
I'm afraid not.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.608
No, no, the chaos,
the collateral damage,

19:00.641 --> 19:02.610
it's just impossible
to control.

19:02.643 --> 19:05.346
Yes, it is, but, being caught
in a Sisyphean cycle,

19:05.379 --> 19:06.714
you continue
to fight against the chaos

19:06.747 --> 19:08.349
that will ultimately prevail

19:08.382 --> 19:10.251
because you're worried
about the external reaction

19:10.284 --> 19:11.752
instead of looking
at the final result

19:11.785 --> 19:14.321
and accepting some things
cannot be controlled.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.658
We're talking about me
and the sandwich thing, right?

19:17.691 --> 19:19.226

Screw it.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.061
Everyone, just find your way
into position.

19:21.094 --> 19:23.631
Do whatever you need to do.
Archer, is the mom gone?

19:23.664 --> 19:26.066
Um, yeah,
you could say that.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.202
It's so hard, you know?

19:28.235 --> 19:30.471
They grow up,
and they're out of your hands.

As a fellow single parent,

19:31.738 --> 19:33.340
I can tell
you're doing your best.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.609
Well, that's why I moved us
to New Jersey.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.478
And what a great choice
that was.

19:37.511 --> 19:39.246

from New Jersey.

we have a lot in common.

Whatever. As long as one of you
is in position.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.354

the weak link after all, huh?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.756
Well, you basically
did nothing,

19:48.789 --> 19:50.624

got you out of that.

did you and Krieger make it
to the mainframe?

Yeah, but only because
Krieger was so brilliant.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.065
Lana, your plan was shit,

19:58.098 --> 19:59.366
especially since
it held Krieger back

19:59.399 --> 20:01.569
from doing the amazing things
he needed to do.

20:01.602 --> 20:04.338
I mean, Krieger,
should we hang out more?
