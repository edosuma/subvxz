[Beth] Bind, bed, bury. What is thy will?

00:23.623 --> 00:25.825
Love has all the power,

00:25.859 --> 00:27.761
lust will devour,

00:27.794 --> 00:30.463
and the heart can never be still.

00:30.497 --> 00:33.833
Bind, bed, bury,

00:33.867 --> 00:36.136
Grant Feigen I will.

00:37.737 --> 00:39.139
Love does devour,

Welcome to Shithole,

01:33.927 --> 01:37.263
population... who gives a fuck?

01:37.297 --> 01:40.200
It's a bus stop, Vickie. What were you hoping for?

01:40.233 --> 01:41.868
Uh... a drug dealer,

01:41.901 --> 01:44.871
a sexy guy up to no good, I mean, I'm not picky.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.575
You know, the bus station of a town

01:48.608 --> 01:50.443
tells you a lot about a place.

01:50.477 --> 01:52.779
Oh, yeah? Well, what's this one telling you?

01:52.812 --> 01:55.348
-That people die here. -Vickie!

01:55.381 --> 01:58.685
-That's in really bad taste. -Of boredom, Helen!

01:58.718 --> 02:00.954
They die of nothing but boredom.

02:00.987 --> 02:05.492
Well, I had cell service, but now... nada.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.660
Beth's aunt said she'd meet us here.

02:07.694 --> 02:10.530
Yeah, I'm not exactly worried about getting lost.

02:10.563 --> 02:13.266
-What are you doing? -Planning my escape.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.568
Who would expect anything different from the inventor

02:15.602 --> 02:17.637
of the Double Dutch Exit?

02:17.670 --> 02:20.907
Two middle fingers to the back of their head and I'm gone.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.242
[vehicle approaching]

02:24.477 --> 02:28.248
You guys lost? Is there someone here I can direct you to?

02:28.281 --> 02:32.385
Uh, yeah. We're looking for the, uh... Gref House?

02:32.418 --> 02:34.787
Ooh. What you want with the Gref House?

02:34.821 --> 02:36.656
Nothing good happening over there.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.391
Well, our friend Beth lived there.

02:38.424 --> 02:41.294
Oh. The funeral.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.396
Yeah, sorry to hear that.

02:43.429 --> 02:46.366
Well, best get in and out of town as fast as you can.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.401
I try and keep things copacetic around here,

02:48.434 --> 02:50.637
but some folks ain't so friendly.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.406
Thanks for the heads up, Officer...

02:53.439 --> 02:55.675
-Jack. You can call me Jack. -Jack.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.443
You want to head down that way.

02:57.477 --> 03:00.346
You hang a left at the house with the sycamore tree.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.483
It's got a sign out front, makes it clear as day.

[indistinct speaking over radio]

03:06.019 --> 03:07.654
Do I know you, son?

03:09.556 --> 03:13.993
-Can't see how. -Okay.

03:15.662 --> 03:18.498
Well, have a great day.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.233
My condolences about your friend.

03:22.502 --> 03:24.804
-That was weird. -Yup.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.298
[Vickie] Beth lived here?

03:52.332 --> 03:54.534
[Simon] I mean, it could use a new coat of paint.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.604
[Helen] And possibly an exorcism.

03:57.637 --> 04:00.406
[Simon] But the bones look good, and I love an old house.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.475
I hope you mean bones metaphorically.

04:02.508 --> 04:03.977
Hmm. Yeah, do I?

04:04.010 --> 04:06.045
-Hmm. -Let's go explore.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.320
Don't chicken out. You owe Beth.

04:15.688 --> 04:16.856
I know.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.893
[Stephanie] Welcome! Welcome.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.896
-I'm sorry I didn't meet you. -No problem.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.765
I was getting the house ready for you,

04:25.798 --> 04:27.834
and I just lost all track of time.

04:27.867 --> 04:31.337
-Simon. -Hi. Yeah.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.473
Yeah. Beth always told me you were a fashion plate.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.909
My condolences on the loss of your friend.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.077
Thank you.

04:39.579 --> 04:42.382
-Aww. -Thank you.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.450
-And to you too. -Yeah. Thank you.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.420
Come here.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.591
Thank you for taking us in.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.794
-We're really going to miss her. -Mm.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.562
I owe it to Beth.

05:00.833 --> 05:02.735
Beth was supposed to attend my funeral,

05:02.769 --> 05:04.337
not the other way around.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.840
Look at me, trapping you on the verandah.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.108
Come in. Come in.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.845
[indistinct whispering]

05:17.550 --> 05:19.419
Whoa.

05:19.452 --> 05:22.422
Thanks for suggesting we stay here, Stephanie.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.691
But if it's too much, we could get a hotel.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.793
-No bother at all. -No, no, no. Don't be silly.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.761
You should stay here to be close to Beth.

05:28.795 --> 05:30.697
It'd be what she wanted.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.599
Besides, Cedar Grove isn't the most welcoming of places.

05:33.633 --> 05:36.135
Yeah, you're the second person to tell us that today.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.438
Old town, afraid of the new.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.673
But you're only staying a couple of nights, right?

05:40.707 --> 05:42.542
Just long enough to pay your respects,

05:42.575 --> 05:44.944
and then scoot back to your regular lives.

05:44.977 --> 05:48.648
I mean, sure. After the reading of Beth's will, of course.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.517
She mentioned you in her will?

05:51.551 --> 05:53.653
According to her lawyer, yeah.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.888
Yeah, he reached out to all of us.

05:55.922 --> 05:58.925
That's how we found out that Beth had...

06:02.562 --> 06:04.731
Is that a problem?

06:04.764 --> 06:08.534
-No. Just a surprise. -Right.

06:08.568 --> 06:12.839
Uh, well, I'm... I'm sure you all have lots to process,

06:12.872 --> 06:17.076
so... before I go, though...

06:20.680 --> 06:22.515
...a little present.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.717
My garden grows on the intersection

06:24.751 --> 06:27.754
of two important ley lines.

06:27.787 --> 06:30.490
They're conduits of the supernatural

06:30.523 --> 06:32.792
and earthly energies.

06:32.825 --> 06:36.162
My plants do some... strange things.

06:36.195 --> 06:40.466
So I warn you, a little goes a long way.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.503
-Thank you. Yeah. So much. -Oh. Yeah. Mmhm.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.872
[Simon] Ahem.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.075
Hey... It'd warm her heart, you being here.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.979
She spoke about you most of all.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.914
Oh.

06:54.947 --> 06:56.482
Her one true love.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.020
You're in touch with the universe.

07:02.722 --> 07:04.490
[rising ambient music]

07:04.524 --> 07:06.759
[receding footsteps]

07:09.529 --> 07:12.165
Ugh. This place gives me the ick.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.734
Uh, if you were serious, there is a motel in town.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.769
-Ugh! -What?

07:16.803 --> 07:19.939
Vickie's not the only one that gets to have an escape plan.

07:19.972 --> 07:22.975
We'll be fine in this house for a couple of days.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.877
It'll be good for us.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.646
Um, sharing a bed?

07:26.679 --> 07:28.981
With someone I'm also not fucking?

07:29.015 --> 07:30.616
Yeah, hard pass.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.618
[Helen] Well, I'm not sleeping alone.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.754
I'm happy to bunk with Helen.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.622
And someone can crash in here.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.827
-Oh. -[Vickie] What?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.063
[Paige] It's Beth's bedroom.

07:45.331 --> 07:46.899
[tense sentimental music]

07:48.634 --> 07:51.737
You don't think Beth did it in here, do you?

07:53.172 --> 07:55.675
-[Paige] I don't know. -[Simon] I didn't want to ask.

07:57.877 --> 08:01.147
My God, it's so Beth in here, you know?

08:01.180 --> 08:02.348
Yeah.

08:02.381 --> 08:05.084
Even after not seeing her for so long, it's like I can...

08:05.117 --> 08:06.886
sense her.

08:06.919 --> 08:08.521
Heh. Not depressing at all.

08:10.756 --> 08:13.059
There are so many photos of us here.

08:13.092 --> 08:15.895
[Helen] Hmm. She looks so happy.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.097
[Vickie] No one puts up sad photos of themselves.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.132
I should've stayed in touch.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.269
I mean, I sent a couple of texts, but...

08:23.302 --> 08:27.306
I wanted to visit her, but she wouldn't let me.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.343
Yeah, she called and...

08:30.376 --> 08:32.011
asked to meet me in person, but I...

08:33.846 --> 08:35.615
I blew her off.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.617
What did she want to talk about?

08:37.650 --> 08:40.987
I don't know. I never gave her the chance to tell me.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.022
Still, she didn't give you any indication

08:43.055 --> 08:45.024
that she was gonna... you know?

08:45.057 --> 08:48.794
We were on the phone for, like, five minutes.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.630
I would've done something if she had.

08:54.667 --> 08:57.603
-These are from you. -Yeah. From way back.

08:59.805 --> 09:02.909
[Vickie] This makes no sense. Beth hated us.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.944
-Not all of us. -You know what I mean.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.314
After that night, after she walked in on...

09:11.284 --> 09:13.152
...and then walked out on all of us.

09:15.321 --> 09:18.658
And then, years later, she comes back here,

09:18.691 --> 09:20.893
builds this shrine to our friendship,

09:20.927 --> 09:23.663
and then, somehow, sweetly leaves us in her will?

09:23.696 --> 09:25.631
It's a fair question.

09:25.665 --> 09:28.267
It was probably the last time she was legitimately happy.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.672
Yeah. I'll take the couch.

09:32.705 --> 09:35.374
Ooh. I got dibs on the big one downstairs.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.177
Fine. The bathtub. Anywhere but here.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.681
[footsteps receding]

09:42.949 --> 09:45.051
You okay to sleep in here, Helen?

09:45.084 --> 09:48.321
-Yeah. -[Paige] I'll get my bag.

09:54.827 --> 09:57.263
[footsteps receding]

09:59.165 --> 10:01.100
[sighs]

10:04.804 --> 10:06.706
[tense ambient music]

10:31.931 --> 10:34.667
-Sorry. -No. It's okay.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.973
-What? -Marry, fuck, kill.

10:41.007 --> 10:44.143
Oh, my God, Beth. Come on.

10:44.176 --> 10:45.745
Not that stupid game again, please.

10:47.179 --> 10:48.881
Marry me...

10:49.982 --> 10:51.851
and I'll fuck you.

10:51.884 --> 10:54.387
And then what? Someone dies? No, thanks.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.022
[Beth sighs]

10:56.055 --> 10:57.857
We can fuck just fine

10:57.890 --> 10:59.759
without anyone dying.

10:59.792 --> 11:00.459
Hmm?

11:01.460 --> 11:04.130
But marry. [sighs]

11:05.431 --> 11:07.433
Call me old-fashioned, Grant,

11:07.466 --> 11:09.035
I just...

11:10.269 --> 11:12.004
I want to wait, okay?

11:14.340 --> 11:15.474
Okay.

11:22.848 --> 11:24.483
Ow.

11:30.956 --> 11:33.125
-[creaking] -[indistinct whispering]

11:47.273 --> 11:49.475
[sighs] Fuck this shit.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.245
[footsteps receding]

11:54.847 --> 11:56.549
Cedar Grove might be weird as fuck,

11:56.582 --> 11:58.250
but they make a good pie.

11:58.284 --> 12:00.920
What was that game we always used to play at pizza nights?

12:00.953 --> 12:02.855
Mm... fuck all your friends?

12:04.190 --> 12:07.827
-Before that. -Marry, fuck, kill.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.361
-Oh. -Right.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.464
-Ding, ding, ding. -Beth was obsessed with it.

12:11.497 --> 12:13.432
You know, she told me once it had roots

12:13.466 --> 12:15.334
in some old Wiccan spell.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.470
Come on. It's a mean and silly game.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.972
-How could it be a spell? -Was it that the...

12:20.005 --> 12:22.374
the repetition of marry, fuck, kill,

12:22.408 --> 12:23.943
marry, fuck, kill, it...

12:23.976 --> 12:26.045
summons something from the other side?

12:26.078 --> 12:27.813
No, no, no. That's Bloody Mary.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.882
You say it three times and she appears.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.418
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary.

12:32.451 --> 12:35.421
Oh, no, no, no, I remember the original spell was

12:35.454 --> 12:38.090
bed, bind, bury.

12:38.124 --> 12:41.060
And it was both a love and a hate spell.

12:41.093 --> 12:44.497
Love and hate. Boring. But bed, now that I can get into.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.899
-You're so predictable. -Helen, you're up.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.502
-Oh. -Marry, fuck, kill.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.303
-Hmm. -No thinking, just say it.

12:51.337 --> 12:54.940
Okay. Marry Simon.

12:54.974 --> 12:57.243
-I'm honoured. -Um...

12:57.276 --> 12:59.411
Fuck Paige.

12:59.445 --> 13:03.315
And kill... Grant.

13:03.349 --> 13:05.885
-Oh. -Ooh.

13:05.918 --> 13:10.055
-Simon, you're up. -Ah, bah-bah-bah.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.958
Hmm...

13:12.992 --> 13:15.394
-Fuck Grant. -[Vickie] Obvious.

13:15.427 --> 13:17.596
-Marry Helen. -Yes, please!

13:17.630 --> 13:19.265
Mmhm. And kill Grant.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.633
-[Paige] Yikes! -[Simon] Sorry.

13:20.666 --> 13:23.102
-Vickie, you're up. -Vickie?

13:23.135 --> 13:26.038
Um... Hmm.

13:26.071 --> 13:28.908
-Well, I think I'd marry Helen. -Thank you!

13:28.941 --> 13:32.411
-[Simon] Cute. -Fuck... probably myself.

13:32.444 --> 13:34.914
-Yeah. I see that for you. -Wow. Classy.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.550
-And I would so kill Grant. -Wow!

13:37.583 --> 13:39.418
-[Helen] Three kills for Grant! -[Simon] Ouch.

13:39.451 --> 13:40.886
Uh, Paige?

13:40.920 --> 13:43.055
Um...

13:43.088 --> 13:45.457
-I'd marry Simon. -Obviously.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.561
-Fuck Helen. -Mm!

13:48.594 --> 13:50.563
And, sorry, yeah, Grant.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.198
-Kill, kill. -[laughing]

13:52.231 --> 13:55.000
Wild how those votes have changed.

13:55.034 --> 13:57.970
Yeah, I'm so surprised everyone wants to marry Mr. Moneybags.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.906
Well, I'd like to think it's a little more than just that.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.442
Wait. Simon chose to fuck and to kill Grant.

14:05.311 --> 14:08.380
I mean, he's the only one here with a penis, so.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.482
-He's my one fuck wonder. -[laughing]

14:10.516 --> 14:12.351
Wait, you're saying it was a technicality?

14:12.384 --> 14:14.286
Yeah.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.188
Wow. Sorry, Grant.

14:16.222 --> 14:17.923
You used to be on top, but now...

14:17.957 --> 14:20.392
How the mighty have fallen!

14:20.426 --> 14:22.361
[Grant] I guess it is true what they say.

14:22.394 --> 14:25.297
Familiarity breeds contempt. Mm?

14:28.534 --> 14:31.470
Yeah, I mean... I think the contempt we feel is

14:31.503 --> 14:34.073
more around you breaking Beth's heart.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.476
That's why we're all here, right?

14:39.111 --> 14:41.680
Pretty sure it was you and Vickie

14:41.714 --> 14:44.950
who got everyone fucked up, which led to a DL sex party.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.353
Mm, yeah, one that you were more than welcome to join in on.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.154
-True. -This isn't a joke.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.257
Beth had a nervous breakdown,

14:51.290 --> 14:53.459
and when she was finally allowed to come home

14:53.492 --> 14:56.161
and lick her wounds, she slit her fucking throat.

14:56.195 --> 14:59.198
-Y'all have a good night. -[Paige] Grant.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.133
[footsteps receding]

15:03.202 --> 15:06.972
We were Beth's entire world, so imagine the betrayal

15:07.006 --> 15:08.574
she must have felt walking in on all of you.

15:08.607 --> 15:09.608
Paige, stop!

15:11.477 --> 15:14.513
Some people change, okay?

15:14.546 --> 15:16.982
And some people stay exactly the same.

15:18.317 --> 15:20.185
Like you, Paige.

15:20.219 --> 15:22.021
You're still a judgmental bitch.

15:23.155 --> 15:25.057
[tense instrumental music]

15:27.793 --> 15:29.595
[Simon sighs]

15:33.766 --> 15:35.401
[knocking]

15:37.770 --> 15:40.172
You okay?

15:40.205 --> 15:42.041
-Been better. -[both chuckle]

15:44.376 --> 15:46.045
You're no worse than any of us.

15:47.179 --> 15:49.415
It feels like I'm worse. Heh.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.283
Or doing worse, I guess.

15:54.219 --> 15:56.522
What I did to Beth...

15:56.555 --> 15:58.557
I don't know.

15:58.590 --> 16:01.060
I just can't escape remembering it,

16:01.093 --> 16:03.162
being in this house,

16:03.195 --> 16:04.530
around all of them.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.301
-Forget them. Forget Beth. -[Grant chuckles]

16:09.335 --> 16:11.036
Forget where we are.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.308
-Okay? -Okay.

16:21.180 --> 16:23.082
[soft instrumental music]

16:32.624 --> 16:34.526
[rising ominous music]

16:39.431 --> 16:41.600
[Paige sighs]

16:41.633 --> 16:44.103
-[camera clicks] -[Helen] Don't mind me.

16:45.537 --> 16:48.307
You just look so perfect, sitting there.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.478
Hey, about what I said back there...

16:54.179 --> 16:56.515
-I'm sorry. -Oh, don't be. You're right.

16:56.548 --> 16:58.784
It wasn't just Grant's fault.

16:58.817 --> 17:00.719
We all screwed over Beth by sleeping with him.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.489
Well... except you.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.159
-You're an angel. -[Paige sighs]

17:07.192 --> 17:09.661
Don't believe me?

17:09.695 --> 17:10.829
Look.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.234
[soft whooshing]

17:15.267 --> 17:17.102
What are all those?

17:20.572 --> 17:22.708
Um... I d--

17:22.741 --> 17:24.243
Maybe my lens is dirty?

17:25.778 --> 17:28.280
No. [Helen chuckles]

17:28.313 --> 17:30.616
-Maybe they were ghosts. -Oh, you!

17:30.649 --> 17:32.151
[both laugh]

17:33.285 --> 17:34.887
Can I say something that I'm...

17:34.920 --> 17:37.189
probably gonna kick myself for saying

17:37.222 --> 17:39.625
as soon as I sober up?

17:39.658 --> 17:43.262
Please. Join the club.

17:43.295 --> 17:45.330
I have a lot of regrets about that night.

17:45.364 --> 17:48.667
Including one very, um...

17:48.700 --> 17:50.302
selfish one.

17:50.335 --> 17:53.806
Oh, yeah? What?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.809
That you weren't there.

18:02.214 --> 18:04.917
[footsteps receding]

18:04.950 --> 18:06.819
[Grant and Vickie moaning]

18:15.427 --> 18:17.329
[Grant and Vickie moaning]

18:28.407 --> 18:30.209
-Wow. -Wow.

18:32.211 --> 18:33.479
Well, that was a blast from the past.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.614
Yeah, that was, uh, hot.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.716
[Vickie laughs]

18:37.749 --> 18:41.320
[sighs] God. I should feel guilty.

18:41.353 --> 18:45.190
-Hmm? -But... nope. Nada.

18:45.224 --> 18:48.393
-[both laugh] -Carpe diem, Beth.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.696
And I only took Latin for, like, a month in high school,

18:50.729 --> 18:52.664
so that might be a little less sex related than I think.

18:54.366 --> 18:56.168
-Hey. -You called me Beth.

18:57.669 --> 18:59.238
Come on. Don't be ridiculous right now.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.542
It was a mistake, all right? It was an accident, Vickie.

19:03.575 --> 19:06.512
Oh, way to go. You got my name in only two guesses.

19:06.545 --> 19:10.449
-Come back to bed. Okay, Vickie? -Not really, no.

19:10.482 --> 19:14.620
-You're a so-so fuck at best. -Oh, wow. Thanks.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.256
Whatever. I'm over it, and I'm splitting.

19:17.289 --> 19:19.458
[sighs] Okay. Where are you gonna go?

19:19.491 --> 19:20.993
You can't just sleep in the tub.

19:21.026 --> 19:22.561
[scoffs] No, idiot. I'm leaving.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.531
I'm leaving.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.866
The last bus for the city leaves in an hour.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.369
I'll be on it by the time you're washing your sad little dick.

19:30.402 --> 19:32.337
[scoffs] Fuckin' loser.

19:32.371 --> 19:34.673
-[door creaks] -[Grant sighs]

19:37.376 --> 19:40.546
[sighs] Fucking kidding me.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.384
Creepy as fuck.

19:50.556 --> 19:52.758
-[rustling] -[wood creaking]

19:52.791 --> 19:54.660
[tense instrumental music]

[growling]

20:16.081 --> 20:18.350
[growling]

20:23.989 --> 20:25.891
If this is a joke, it isn't fucking funny.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.963

20:30.996 --> 20:32.731

-[groan] -[squelch]

20:44.443 --> 20:46.311
[eerie instrumental music]

20:54.820 --> 20:57.589
[Helen] Who leaves in the night without saying goodbye?

20:57.623 --> 20:59.524
[Paige] Vickie does.

20:59.558 --> 21:02.094
I'm sure she gave us all silent middle fingers.

21:02.127 --> 21:05.497
She couldn't have waited eight hours to bury her friend?

21:05.530 --> 21:08.000
I mean, the reading of the will alone should've kept her.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.670
It's what Vickie does.

21:11.703 --> 21:14.106
She'll probably ask us to email her all the details.

21:14.139 --> 21:15.974
It's not like she wanted to be here.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.010
Nobody wants to be here.

21:19.411 --> 21:20.779
But it's the right thing to do.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.548
The respectful thing.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.955
[sighing]

-[eerie instrumental music] -[singers vocalizing]

-[eerie instrumental music] -[singers vocalizing]

[Paige sighs]

22:24.209 --> 22:25.944
[Grant exhales sharply]

22:27.746 --> 22:29.581
[Grant groans]

22:41.059 --> 22:43.895
Funerals are extra hard for people like us.

22:44.963 --> 22:47.199
People like us?

22:47.232 --> 22:49.768
I'm an empath.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.737
You know, those with the gift.

22:54.072 --> 22:56.575
-"Stephanie's Second Sight." -Just down the road, in town.

22:58.677 --> 23:00.645
You have the sight too.

23:03.982 --> 23:06.651
You're not yet in a clear relationship with your powers.

23:06.685 --> 23:09.688
Powers? I don't have any powers.

23:11.056 --> 23:14.159
You don't feel things? See things?

23:16.061 --> 23:19.030
When Beth went off to college and met all of you,

23:19.064 --> 23:22.167
she thought she'd finally escaped.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.069
I did too.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.838
Escaped from what?

23:26.872 --> 23:29.674
The Grefs aren't just any old family.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.910
We have a storied lineage,

23:31.943 --> 23:35.147
one that's been ripped apart by tragedy for generations.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.551
My brother disowned me

23:39.584 --> 23:42.087
for standing by my niece.

23:44.289 --> 23:47.492
I failed her, but I will not fail you.

23:50.128 --> 23:52.130
You're susceptible to the dark arts, like she was.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.068
When the funeral is over,

23:57.102 --> 24:00.639
escape while you still can and promise never to come back.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.010
Everything okay?

24:06.611 --> 24:08.613
Yes.

24:08.647 --> 24:10.582
We were just saying how...

24:10.615 --> 24:11.817
peaceful she looks.

24:13.218 --> 24:15.086
Yes, she really does.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.123
Remember what I told you.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.064
What was all that about?

24:26.097 --> 24:27.766
Some bullshit about a family curse

24:27.799 --> 24:29.634
and me having psychic powers.

24:29.668 --> 24:31.837
-What? -And that we need to leave.

24:31.870 --> 24:34.806
Ah, yes, which very conveniently gets us out of town right

24:34.840 --> 24:37.008
before Beth's will is read.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.777
I don't know. She seemed legit concerned, okay?

24:38.810 --> 24:40.946
[Paige sighs]

24:40.979 --> 24:43.815
Did you see her reaction when she found out about Beth's will?

24:45.584 --> 24:47.819
Stephanie is playing you, Grant.

24:49.988 --> 24:52.057
[sighs] Let's sit down.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.525
-Yeah. -Yeah.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.229
[soft unsettling music]

25:06.004 --> 25:08.807
-[Grant sighs] -[door shuts]

25:10.876 --> 25:13.245
-[Grant sighs] -We've mourned Beth's death.

25:15.013 --> 25:19.217
I think it's time... we celebrate her life.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.086
Couldn't hurt. [sighs]

25:23.922 --> 25:26.057
Agreed. Anything to make this better.

25:27.292 --> 25:29.728
-Paige? -Weed fucks me up.

25:30.962 --> 25:32.297
Yeah. It's supposed to.

25:34.633 --> 25:35.834
[Simon] More for us.

25:37.168 --> 25:39.638
[laughing]

25:39.671 --> 25:41.706
Paige, you are missing out, let me tell you.

25:41.740 --> 25:43.975
No, I'm really not.

25:44.009 --> 25:46.378
You guys remember that time you convinced Beth to do 'shrooms?

25:46.411 --> 25:48.313
-Oh, God. Yeah. -Whoa.

25:48.346 --> 25:50.615
She tripped super hard, didn't she?

25:50.649 --> 25:53.685
She was really into UFOs then.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.354
She drove me nuts with all that little green men shit.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.758
She used to stand in our dorm room window,

25:59.791 --> 26:02.093
praying to be abducted.

26:02.127 --> 26:04.095
You remember when we convinced her that we were the aliens?

26:04.129 --> 26:05.997
[laughing]

26:06.031 --> 26:08.767
When we covered the common room in foil and made it look

26:08.800 --> 26:11.403
like a medical experiment room on a space ship!

26:11.436 --> 26:13.672
Yeah, and she kept asking to be probed.

26:13.705 --> 26:15.941
[laughing]

26:15.974 --> 26:18.910
She did not understand why that was so funny.

26:18.944 --> 26:21.313
No, she could not figure it out.

26:21.346 --> 26:24.115
-[laughing] -[Helen] Oh, God.

26:24.149 --> 26:26.284
-[Helen] "Probe me!"

26:26.318 --> 26:29.054
-[laughing] -[Helen] She could not...

28:28.373 --> 28:30.141
Fuck.

28:49.027 --> 28:51.796
Jesus! What the fuck?

28:54.199 --> 28:55.967
What are you doing up here?

28:56.000 --> 28:59.104
Me? What are you doing up here?

28:59.137 --> 29:01.339
I followed you to make sure you were all right.

29:01.372 --> 29:04.542
-You're high as a kite. -Yeah, I...

29:04.576 --> 29:08.179
I don't know. I... just thought I saw something.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.315
Like what?

29:10.348 --> 29:12.584
Nothing. Just forget about it, okay?

29:12.617 --> 29:15.086
You're not acting like it was nothing. What'd you see, Grant?

29:16.354 --> 29:19.157
Not what... who.

29:21.359 --> 29:23.595
It looked like it was Beth, okay?

29:23.628 --> 29:25.430
I know what you're gonna say, it's the drugs and I'm stupid.

29:25.463 --> 29:28.533
No. No, it's not stupid to me.

29:31.102 --> 29:34.539
You two had something flawed but special, and this place...

29:36.274 --> 29:38.543
it's like I can feel Beth everywhere, like...

29:40.478 --> 29:43.481
like she wants us to know something... some secret?

29:48.419 --> 29:50.455
This house is like a shrine to her.

29:53.091 --> 29:54.592
Glad I'm not the only one.

29:56.161 --> 29:59.297
Yeah, it's not easy. None of this is.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.001
At least we have each other, right?

30:03.034 --> 30:04.269
Yeah.

30:06.004 --> 30:09.040
Whoa! What are you doing?

30:09.073 --> 30:12.076
Shit. Uh... I'm super high right now.

30:12.110 --> 30:14.345
-Sorry. It's-- -So?!

30:14.379 --> 30:17.382
High, not high, this you all the time.

30:19.517 --> 30:21.419
And you know...

30:21.452 --> 30:23.421
the only reason you wanna get with me is

30:23.454 --> 30:26.124
because I'm the only one who won't let you.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.293
Hasn't your dick caused enough problems?

30:29.394 --> 30:30.562
[footsteps receding]

30:32.397 --> 30:35.133
[Helen] Okay, but I am not nearly as fancy as you.

30:35.166 --> 30:38.536
No, but you did win the Most Promising New Artist Award.

30:38.570 --> 30:42.006
-I saw it online. -It was not that big of a deal.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.475
-It was a huge deal. -[Helen laughs]

30:44.509 --> 30:49.013
[Helen] Compared to you, Mr. Junior Partner?

30:49.047 --> 30:52.317
We're both doing great. Okay?

30:52.350 --> 30:54.519
Yeah, but we're both not making six figures.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.690
Yeah, you're right about that one for sure.

30:58.723 --> 31:00.959
[Helen] What do you make in a year?

31:00.992 --> 31:02.660
-[Simon] A lot. -[soft whooshing]

31:02.694 --> 31:05.196
Not getting in on the cheque-measuring brag-a-thon?

31:05.230 --> 31:07.065
Beth?

31:08.299 --> 31:10.235
Am I...

31:10.268 --> 31:12.303
How are you...

31:12.337 --> 31:14.439
It's all right. Calm down.

31:16.474 --> 31:19.410
Am I here or am I on the other side?

31:19.444 --> 31:22.046
Or am I just a figment of your drugged-up imagination?

31:23.615 --> 31:25.583
[Beth] Does it matter?

31:25.617 --> 31:28.620
All that matters is you're far more than any of our friends.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.656
[inaudible conversation]

31:31.689 --> 31:33.658
[Beth sighs]

31:33.691 --> 31:36.160
A true original.

31:36.194 --> 31:38.663
Your thoughts and emotions run deep.

31:38.696 --> 31:39.931
They always have.

31:41.766 --> 31:44.168
Come, gaze at the moon with me.

31:47.538 --> 31:50.541
Every group has a charismatic centre.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.444
And it sure as hell isn't any of those duds in there.

31:53.478 --> 31:55.380
[Grant chuckles] Nope.

31:56.481 --> 31:58.082
Not even close.

31:58.116 --> 32:00.084
Well, look at them all trying

32:00.118 --> 32:03.187
to impress each other still.

32:03.221 --> 32:04.722
"I'm an important artist."

32:04.756 --> 32:06.991
"I make six figures in my designer suit."

32:08.459 --> 32:10.228
Anybody who really matters...

32:11.729 --> 32:14.198
doesn't give a shit about any of that stuff.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.101
[soft instrumental music]

32:19.370 --> 32:21.072
Like you.

32:24.642 --> 32:27.712
[sighs]

32:27.745 --> 32:31.082
You can just... be

32:32.684 --> 32:34.285
in your power.

32:35.353 --> 32:37.755
[sighs]

32:37.789 --> 32:42.160
But when you have power like yours...

32:44.696 --> 32:46.998
...you have to be careful who you wanna share it with.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.768
[softly] You can't just unleash it to anyone.

32:54.138 --> 32:56.607
[sighs]

32:56.641 --> 32:58.276
They have to be able to take it.

33:03.348 --> 33:04.549
[softly] I can take it, Grant.

33:07.852 --> 33:09.287
I can take it all.

33:11.422 --> 33:13.191
I thought you said you wanted to wait until you got married.

33:13.224 --> 33:15.626
Shh.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.663
Forget what I said before.

33:25.303 --> 33:26.671
[softly] Give it to me.

33:28.706 --> 33:30.341
Now.

33:35.413 --> 33:37.782
-[Grant] Oh... -[Beth] Yes.

33:37.815 --> 33:39.751
[both panting]

33:48.292 --> 33:51.295
-[Beth] Give it to me. -[Grant groans]

33:55.533 --> 33:57.702
Give it to me. [panting]

33:59.537 --> 34:01.105
[demonic voice] Give it to me!

34:03.841 --> 34:06.344
[groans]

34:06.377 --> 34:08.446
What the fuck...

34:08.479 --> 34:09.781
Oh.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.821
[groaning]

34:28.833 --> 34:30.902
-Milk? -Yes, please. Thank you.

34:30.935 --> 34:34.639
-Mmhm. -Wow! It's alive.

34:34.672 --> 34:35.873
We were wondering when you'd show up.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.275
We couldn't find you anywhere.

34:37.308 --> 34:40.144
[Grant] Yeah. I, uh...

34:40.178 --> 34:41.679
crashed outside last night.

34:41.712 --> 34:44.582
-[liquid pouring] -Ooh. Braver than me.

34:44.615 --> 34:46.651
[scoffs] Yeah.

34:46.684 --> 34:49.153
I'm pretty wrecked, though. You guys?

34:49.187 --> 34:51.722
That pot is pretty potent.

34:51.756 --> 34:54.525
But I don't think anything's potent enough

34:54.559 --> 34:56.294
to have me out sleeping under the stars,

34:56.327 --> 34:58.262
hanging a wang for the neighbours.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.565
-[camera clicks] -Don't do that.

35:00.598 --> 35:02.867
Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.269
Huh. Yeah.

35:05.303 --> 35:08.840
Seriously. What's going on?

35:08.873 --> 35:10.141
Um...

35:11.509 --> 35:12.777
I, uh...

35:14.745 --> 35:16.481
I saw Beth last night.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.551
Yeah. And I didn't just see her.

35:20.585 --> 35:22.320
We... talked, we...

35:23.955 --> 35:26.257
I've seen things on pot before.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.192
This was more than just seeing things, okay?

35:29.927 --> 35:32.763
You're letting that crackpot Stephanie get to you.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.633
[Simon] There's no such thing as ghosts or spells

35:35.666 --> 35:37.635
or family curses.

35:37.668 --> 35:41.739
Oh, yeah? Then how do you explain this?

35:41.772 --> 35:43.741
[Helen] And this isn't the first one, either.

35:43.774 --> 35:47.211
I keep getting these apparitions on my pictures

35:47.245 --> 35:49.947
and it only started when we got to Cedar Grove.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.782
It's called a coincidence.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.452
You're so goddamn sure of yourself, aren't you?

35:54.485 --> 35:55.820
In this instance, yes.

35:55.853 --> 35:59.290
We're born, we die, and we try to fuck

35:59.323 --> 36:01.425
as much as we can in between, and that's it.

36:01.459 --> 36:03.828
Wow. Thank you so much for your TED Talk on the meaning of life.

36:03.861 --> 36:06.564
[Simon] You guys know I'm right!

36:06.597 --> 36:10.701
People always worry about this meaning of life bullshit.

36:10.735 --> 36:12.770
Well, it's... it's simple.

36:12.803 --> 36:15.373
You just get what you want now.

36:15.406 --> 36:16.874
And that's what made you so successful?

36:16.908 --> 36:19.310
Being ruthless, grabbing what you want by the balls?

36:19.343 --> 36:21.312
Oh, yeah, what, as opposed to dropping out of college

36:21.345 --> 36:23.548
after one stupid mistake?

36:23.581 --> 36:26.884
Okay, okay. We don't need a testosterone-off, boys.

36:28.953 --> 36:32.723
But I do need you all to eat up. The lawyer will be here soon.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.898
Beth Gref, having no siblings or issue,

36:40.932 --> 36:44.001
has left the entirety of her estate to those present.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.836
I will now read the will.

36:48.339 --> 36:51.375
"For her friendship, help and unwavering support,"

36:51.409 --> 36:53.477
"I leave the land at Feragun Creek to my aunt,"

36:53.511 --> 36:55.746
"Stephanie Gref."

36:55.780 --> 36:57.481
Too kind. Far too kind.

36:59.517 --> 37:01.652
"And all of my remaining assets, both liquid and otherwise,"

37:01.686 --> 37:04.589
"including Gref House and everything inside it,"

37:04.622 --> 37:06.357
"I leave to those who I hope will live the rest"

37:06.390 --> 37:08.426
"of their lives there:"

37:08.459 --> 37:10.595
-"Paige Ludlow..." -What?

37:10.628 --> 37:14.432
"Helen Ellison, Simon Carpenter,"

37:14.465 --> 37:17.702
"Vickie Kavanagh and Grant Feigen."

37:19.837 --> 37:22.707
"May my house and the beds in it bind you all together"

37:22.740 --> 37:25.042
"and bury the troubles that once tore us apart."

37:26.777 --> 37:29.814
This can't be right.

37:29.847 --> 37:31.816
I assure you, it was Beth's wish.

37:31.849 --> 37:32.516
She made these changes weeks ago.

37:34.552 --> 37:37.054
Translation: how dare she leave me some crappy old creek bed

37:37.088 --> 37:38.623
and everything else to them?

37:38.656 --> 37:39.957
Okay.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.892
[tense instrumental music]

37:44.929 --> 37:47.598
You stay here...

37:47.632 --> 37:49.800
and Beth has signed your death warrants.

37:55.473 --> 37:57.074
[footsteps receding]

37:57.108 --> 38:00.378
It'll take a few days for the paperwork to go through,

38:00.411 --> 38:02.513
but for all intents and purposes, welcome...

38:02.546 --> 38:04.548
to your new home.

38:04.582 --> 38:05.950
[Paige] Thanks.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.890
[scoffs] Holy shit.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.960
[both scoff]

38:18.095 --> 38:19.930
[sighs]

38:21.399 --> 38:23.701
[Simon] No signal. Again.

38:23.734 --> 38:25.002
She's okay, right?

38:26.604 --> 38:28.472
This small-fry town having no cell service

38:28.506 --> 38:30.474
has nothing to do with Vickie.

38:30.508 --> 38:32.877
Still, it's weird, her just leaving

38:32.910 --> 38:34.879
in the middle of the night like that.

38:34.912 --> 38:36.647
Have you met Vickie?

38:36.681 --> 38:39.784
Sure, but... what if she wants to sell the house?

38:39.817 --> 38:42.553
-What do we do then? -We don't have to keep it.

38:42.586 --> 38:44.522
We could... buff it up, slap some new paint on it.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.958
I don't know. I never thought I'd own a house.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.030
Grant. You're awfully quiet.

38:53.064 --> 38:57.702
Uh... Yeah, I guess I could do with starting over too.

38:57.735 --> 38:58.703
Not that it did Beth any good.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.573
Well, we don't have to decide tonight.

39:02.606 --> 39:04.842
I mean, we can't until we get in touch with Vickie anyway.

39:04.875 --> 39:07.111
Something tells me we haven't heard the last of Stephanie.

39:07.144 --> 39:09.447
[Simon] Yeah.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.582
I bet she thought all this would end up going to her.

39:11.615 --> 39:15.419
So expect more "run for your lives" mumbo jumbo.

39:15.453 --> 39:17.822
Beth left us this house and its contents.

39:19.490 --> 39:22.493
-People like antiques. -Yeah, I like antiques.

39:22.526 --> 39:25.896
But, uh, most of this crap is pretty run down.

39:25.930 --> 39:27.998
Unless all the good stuff's locked away somewhere.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.769
[clicking]

39:31.802 --> 39:33.904
It's not the easiest kind of lock to pick, but...

39:33.938 --> 39:35.840
I might be able to pull it off.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.575
Would a coat hanger work?

39:37.608 --> 39:40.644
-Mm. -You pick locks now?

39:40.678 --> 39:43.514
Somebody took a dark turn after college.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.483
Whatever.

39:46.684 --> 39:48.786
-[whoosh] -Oh, Jesus! Jesus!

39:48.819 --> 39:50.621
[Helen] What is it?!

39:52.757 --> 39:55.059
I just saw someone in there.

39:55.092 --> 39:56.994
And they were looking right back at me.

39:57.027 --> 39:58.829
You saw someone in there?

39:58.863 --> 40:00.664
Yeah, 'cause he smoked more of Stephanie's weed.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.834
No, Simon. I didn't.

40:06.837 --> 40:08.839
Whatever. Okay.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.542
[exhales sharply]

40:11.575 --> 40:13.477
[tense ambient music]

40:17.948 --> 40:20.117
[Grant sighs]

40:20.151 --> 40:21.218
[clicking]

40:23.053 --> 40:25.456
-[door opens] -[Grant] Oh.

40:26.824 --> 40:28.459
Whoa...

40:32.696 --> 40:34.765
[Simon chuckles]

40:39.904 --> 40:41.639
[Paige] Oh, wow.

40:45.209 --> 40:48.179
Guys, this is, like... like, real silver.

40:48.212 --> 40:49.880
Not just silver-plated.

40:49.914 --> 40:50.748
[Grant] Think Beth knew all this was in here?

40:52.783 --> 40:55.252
[Simon] I'm guessing yes, and that she wanted all of us,

40:55.286 --> 40:57.288
or at least me, to have it.

40:57.321 --> 41:01.091
[Helen] Ha! Some of this stuff... super creepy.

41:02.326 --> 41:03.861
[Grant] Hey, what is that?

41:05.262 --> 41:07.832
Looks like some sort of witch book.

41:07.865 --> 41:10.034
[Grant] Oh, shit. "The Gref family."

41:11.235 --> 41:13.771
"One of the original families."

41:13.804 --> 41:15.706
"Descended from the necronomical sect"

41:15.739 --> 41:18.309
"of Asmodeus."

41:18.342 --> 41:21.879
"The Gref founded the Dark Tern in 1432"

41:21.912 --> 41:24.081
"and are said to be the pre-eminent practitioners"

41:24.114 --> 41:26.684
"of Soot, the long-lost art"

41:26.717 --> 41:29.153
"of demonic jurisdiction."

41:29.186 --> 41:31.288
Okay. What the fuck is a "necronomical sect"?

41:31.322 --> 41:33.123
Ooh, necro's never good.

41:33.157 --> 41:35.059
Super deathy.

41:35.092 --> 41:38.128
I vote we sell this house.

41:38.162 --> 41:41.632
Yeah, let's sell it as fast as we can and get the hell out.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.968
It's the house... from way back when. Look.

41:45.936 --> 41:49.006
"Abigail Gref left Prussia and built a new homestead"

41:49.039 --> 41:51.141
"in Cedar Grove,"

41:51.175 --> 41:52.943
"at the intersection of two particular ley lines."

41:52.977 --> 41:56.080
-Are you kidding me, man? -This witch shit is getting old.

41:57.781 --> 42:00.284
-[dramatic sound indication] -Holy shit.

42:02.186 --> 42:02.987
Grant, it's you.

42:06.924 --> 42:08.325
Hey, it must be a weird coincidence.

42:08.359 --> 42:11.795
Coincidence?! That looks exactly like him!

42:11.829 --> 42:16.033
This... this house must be built on one of those ley line things.

42:16.066 --> 42:17.935
Maybe that's why my camera's been acting up.

42:17.968 --> 42:20.037
Give me a break!

42:20.070 --> 42:21.939
If we weren't all in this creepy ass house right now,

42:21.972 --> 42:23.274
we'd all be laughing.

42:23.307 --> 42:27.177
-[Helen scoffs] -I need some air. Yeah.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.880
[footsteps receding]

42:29.914 --> 42:31.982
[ominous sound indication]

42:34.218 --> 42:36.620
-[footsteps approaching] -[knocking]

42:37.922 --> 42:41.058
So? What happened back there?

42:41.091 --> 42:44.028
[scoffs] Uh, well...

42:44.061 --> 42:47.197
there's a photo that looks exactly like me

42:47.231 --> 42:49.633
in some... fucked-up book that we found

42:49.667 --> 42:51.936
in a room full of occult stuff

42:51.969 --> 42:53.337
in the house where Beth killed herself.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.808
Do you think I should be acting any different right now?

42:57.841 --> 42:59.710
Well, the Grant I knew wouldn't be having trouble breathing

42:59.743 --> 43:01.278
over a photo.

43:07.117 --> 43:09.720
Hey. It's just a book.

43:10.988 --> 43:11.922
[Grant sighs]

43:13.857 --> 43:16.360
And you don't even look all that much alike.

43:16.393 --> 43:18.996
Not really.

43:19.029 --> 43:20.965
Your noses are different.

43:23.167 --> 43:25.202
Oh, there's a crease in his forehead you don't have.

43:26.904 --> 43:29.840
And most importantly,

43:29.873 --> 43:31.141
this photo is over 100 years old.

43:32.242 --> 43:33.844
And it was taken in Ireland.

43:34.945 --> 43:36.180
Beth's family was from Germany.

43:37.948 --> 43:39.850
Uh, he's not related to Beth.

43:41.819 --> 43:43.320
Different family entirely.

43:43.354 --> 43:45.155
His surname was...

43:46.256 --> 43:47.891
Faodhagain.

43:49.760 --> 43:51.829
No connection to Beth at all.

43:53.263 --> 43:55.299
It's a fluke. Nothing else.

43:58.035 --> 43:59.103
Yeah. Uh...

44:00.771 --> 44:04.808
Sorry I was so, uh... dramatic back there.

44:04.842 --> 44:07.378
Actually, watching cool-ass you finally lose your shit

44:07.411 --> 44:08.779
like the rest of us this weekend?

44:10.080 --> 44:11.415
It was kind of a relief.

44:13.250 --> 44:16.186
[water dripping]

44:16.220 --> 44:19.023
[sighs]

44:20.924 --> 44:22.926
[soft whooshing]

44:25.496 --> 44:27.931
If one of you assholes is about to run in here

44:27.965 --> 44:30.234
and pour a bucket of ice water on me,

44:30.267 --> 44:33.437
just know there will be hell to pay.

44:36.273 --> 44:38.042
[soft whooshing]

44:40.144 --> 44:42.246
Seriously, is someone there? 'Cause this shit isn't funny.

44:42.279 --> 44:44.148
[tense instrumental music]

44:46.917 --> 44:48.819
[chuckles]

44:48.852 --> 44:51.422
Jesus.

44:51.455 --> 44:52.890
Get a fucking grip, buddy.

44:52.923 --> 44:55.292
[sighs]

44:55.325 --> 44:57.227
[dramatic sound indication]

44:57.261 --> 44:59.163
[muffled screaming]

45:06.470 --> 45:08.472
[screaming]

45:08.505 --> 45:09.440
Simon?

45:12.409 --> 45:14.178
-Simon? -Was that one of you fuckers?!

45:14.211 --> 45:15.512
-What? -Pulling me under!

45:17.581 --> 45:19.950
I don't understand. You think one of us pulled you under?

45:19.983 --> 45:22.352
-[sighs] -Without you seeing us?

45:22.386 --> 45:23.320
[softly] Fuck.

45:25.089 --> 45:27.791
[Paige sighs] You were saying?

45:30.928 --> 45:32.930
You scared the shit out of us, man.

45:35.933 --> 45:38.001
I--I swear, something grabbed me.

45:38.035 --> 45:39.470
Lay off the weed, bro.

45:39.503 --> 45:42.806
-[soft whooshing] -[scuttling]

45:42.840 --> 45:45.576
Okay. You heard that, right?

45:45.609 --> 45:48.479
Yeah... and it's not the first time.

45:48.512 --> 45:50.380
What is it?

45:50.414 --> 45:52.850
If I'm gonna get any sleep tonight,

45:52.883 --> 45:54.051
I need to find out.

45:56.086 --> 45:58.088
[footsteps receding]

45:58.122 --> 46:00.257
-[Simon sighs] -[Helen] Creepy!

46:00.290 --> 46:02.559
What, were you hoping for a spa?

46:02.593 --> 46:04.261
It's an attic.

46:04.294 --> 46:06.330
Creepy and cobwebs are guaranteed.

46:06.363 --> 46:08.298
I hate you.

46:08.332 --> 46:10.334
-After you. -Mm-mm.

46:10.367 --> 46:12.169
-You first. -Oh, fine.

46:15.472 --> 46:17.241
Oh, boy.

46:17.274 --> 46:19.143
[unsettling instrumental music]

46:25.082 --> 46:28.185
So... what exactly are we looking for here?

46:29.553 --> 46:31.321
A mystical rat from the fifth dimension.

46:38.495 --> 46:40.430
Look what we have here.

46:40.464 --> 46:41.965
[Helen] Weird.

46:41.999 --> 46:43.200
-You wanna hold this for me? -Yeah.

46:44.234 --> 46:46.036
What...

46:47.504 --> 46:48.872
-Oh, boy. -Watch out.

46:50.574 --> 46:52.276
[sighs] Bet you there's a nest up there.

46:52.309 --> 46:54.077
Huh.

46:54.111 --> 46:56.113
Or maybe even Rat King.

46:56.146 --> 46:57.581
-Yeah. -Yeah.

46:59.616 --> 47:01.351
[Simon grunts]

47:05.622 --> 47:08.659
[Simon grunts]

47:08.692 --> 47:11.962
-Oh, my God! -[Helen screams]

47:20.070 --> 47:22.506
[Helen] Why is there a giant collection of bones

47:22.539 --> 47:25.342
locked away in the attic?

47:25.375 --> 47:27.311
I swear to God, if these things are fucking human...

47:27.344 --> 47:30.013
Um... Yeah, these...

47:30.047 --> 47:32.182
-These look human to me. -Oh, God.

47:33.684 --> 47:37.120
This is part of a human skull.

47:37.154 --> 47:38.589
And...

47:40.224 --> 47:43.527
Huh. Interesting. This isn't human.

47:43.560 --> 47:46.496
You're okay with this?! That looks demonic!

47:46.530 --> 47:49.032
This is all probably just from a goat or something.

47:49.066 --> 47:51.001
-Somehow, that makes it worse. -Yeah.

47:51.034 --> 47:52.536
It's like a fucking sacrifice or something.

47:52.569 --> 47:54.972
Yeah, like something Satanic.

47:55.005 --> 47:57.608
Human bones, goat bones mixed together. Oh, God. Um...

47:57.641 --> 48:00.010
-We need to tell the police. -About what?

48:00.043 --> 48:01.478
A murder that happened a century ago?

48:01.511 --> 48:03.013
You don't know that.

48:05.249 --> 48:06.550
You don't wanna have to admit it,

48:06.583 --> 48:08.619
but you know something's happened here.

48:08.652 --> 48:10.554
Okay, sure. Listen.

48:10.587 --> 48:13.290
There's lots of bones. Some human, some not.

48:13.323 --> 48:15.459
It's--it's very weird,

48:15.492 --> 48:17.628
but also very real things.

48:17.661 --> 48:21.198
All right? Go ahead. Call the police, I guess.

48:21.231 --> 48:24.268
-He's got a point, Helen. -Thank you.

48:24.301 --> 48:26.370
With the dust and the cobwebs, whoever this is

48:26.403 --> 48:28.338
was placed in here a long time ago.

48:28.372 --> 48:31.408
It doesn't matter when it happened!

48:31.441 --> 48:33.443
-Who would do this and why? -[Simon] Okay.

48:33.477 --> 48:36.013
-Well, what do we do now? -We get the fuck out is what!

48:36.046 --> 48:38.682
-Yeah. -The last bus left an hour ago.

48:38.715 --> 48:40.651
And we're in the land that Uber forgot.

48:40.684 --> 48:43.654
-And cell service, so. -There's a hotel in town.

48:43.687 --> 48:47.157
-It's a motel. -I don't care if it's a hostel.

48:47.190 --> 48:49.126
Anywhere is better than this.

48:49.159 --> 48:51.628
-[footsteps receding] -[Simon sighs]

48:54.331 --> 48:56.400
Yeah.

48:59.436 --> 49:02.072
[ominous instrumental music]

49:07.311 --> 49:11.014
-Are you fucking kidding me? -[Helen sighs]

49:11.048 --> 49:14.251
-Okay, what do we do now? -Walk? Hitchhike?

49:14.284 --> 49:16.019
Just get the hell out of here.

49:16.053 --> 49:17.554
We can't walk the whole way home, Helen.

49:19.423 --> 49:21.191
Who knows? Maybe the town jail's got some comfy beds.

49:22.726 --> 49:24.628
I thought you guys would be gone by now.

49:24.661 --> 49:26.496
We wanna be, Officer.

49:26.530 --> 49:29.032
We're looking for a place to stay the night.

49:29.066 --> 49:31.134
Well, there's no room at the town's only major.

49:32.235 --> 49:33.737
-Bad luck. -No.

49:33.770 --> 49:36.206
They turned on the "No Vacancy" sign when they saw us.

49:36.239 --> 49:38.375
Well, I told you what to expect.

49:38.408 --> 49:40.277
Please, we are desperate here, Officer.

49:40.310 --> 49:43.547
Desperate? I heard you kids just inherited a whole house.

49:45.649 --> 49:47.818
Well, you're not the first who couldn't stomach that place,

49:47.851 --> 49:50.487
but best get back and tough it out

49:50.520 --> 49:52.589
before some of the less friendly folks let the hounds out.

49:52.622 --> 49:54.324
[indistinct speaking over radio]

49:56.593 --> 50:00.797
Okay, I am so tired of this town and its asshole inhabitants.

50:00.831 --> 50:04.568
Let's just... do what he said and go back to the Hell House.

50:04.601 --> 50:06.069
-Do we have to? -Beats sleeping on the street.

50:07.871 --> 50:09.639
Why don't you guys go back and try and get some sleep?

50:09.673 --> 50:12.676
-While you do what? -I'm gonna get us some answers.

50:12.709 --> 50:15.545
Grant, come on. We should stick together.

50:15.579 --> 50:17.614
I'll be fine. Trust me.

50:20.851 --> 50:23.320
[soft instrumental music]

50:29.159 --> 50:31.094
I've been expecting you.

50:35.165 --> 50:37.267
I don't want to go back in there.

50:38.769 --> 50:41.271
Hey, you'll be fine. I promise.

50:47.577 --> 50:50.280
-[cracking] -What was that?

50:51.681 --> 50:54.384
It's Vickie's phone. It's smashed!

50:54.418 --> 50:56.586
Explains why she hasn't been answering our calls.

50:56.620 --> 50:58.488
She probably just dropped it or something.

50:58.522 --> 51:01.124
And then stomped on it?

51:01.158 --> 51:02.826
Vickie's crazy, but she's not that crazy.

51:04.795 --> 51:07.564
Why are you so resistant to everything that's happening?

51:07.597 --> 51:12.636
I'm not. I just wanna sleep, wake up and get out of here.

51:12.669 --> 51:14.671
[footsteps receding]

51:14.704 --> 51:16.773
It's not just me, right?

51:16.807 --> 51:19.409
No. No, it's not just you.

51:20.677 --> 51:22.879
[footsteps receding]

51:22.913 --> 51:25.248
[sighs]

51:27.451 --> 51:29.519
If Beth killed herself, it wasn't

51:29.553 --> 51:31.254
because I broke her heart.

51:32.722 --> 51:34.758
-At least, not entirely. -Then what was it?

51:36.226 --> 51:39.529
That house! I mean, this town...

51:39.563 --> 51:42.899
There is something... wrong here.

51:42.933 --> 51:45.502
Something evil.

51:45.535 --> 51:47.671
You see, you do feel things.

51:49.539 --> 51:52.709
The answers you seek in the present lie in the past.

51:54.377 --> 51:56.546
You need a crash course in the Gref family.

51:56.580 --> 51:59.483
Oh, yeah? Well...

52:04.688 --> 52:06.289
I'd say I've got a pretty good idea already.

52:07.524 --> 52:08.859
So you do.

52:10.427 --> 52:12.729
May I?

52:14.731 --> 52:18.368
It all starts with Abigail Gref,

52:18.401 --> 52:19.936
the hateful monster who built this house

52:19.970 --> 52:23.273
a century ago as a place to practise her dark arts.

52:23.306 --> 52:25.342
[Grant] Jesus.

52:28.645 --> 52:30.614
-That's me and Beth. -No.

52:30.647 --> 52:33.750
That's Dillon Faodhagain and Abigail Gref.

52:33.783 --> 52:36.920
No. Screw this! This is...

52:36.953 --> 52:38.522
This is just some cruel, fucked up joke

52:38.555 --> 52:39.923
by my so-called friends, isn't it?

52:41.825 --> 52:44.661
Helen's already been messing with the pictures and...

52:44.694 --> 52:47.831
-No, this has got to be them. -It's not. I swear.

52:49.833 --> 52:52.335
Now do you see why it's not safe to be here?

52:54.304 --> 52:55.539
You're his latest incarnation.

52:57.274 --> 52:59.709
Abigail Gref and Dillon Faodhagain are pawns

52:59.743 --> 53:01.711
for the demonic underworld.

53:01.745 --> 53:03.547
Vessels.

53:03.580 --> 53:05.649
And their twisted fornication, it is told,

53:05.682 --> 53:08.618
begat the one who denies the Father and the Son,

53:08.652 --> 53:11.788
the Little Horn, the Beast of the Sea.

53:11.821 --> 53:14.291
What the hell are you talking about?

53:14.324 --> 53:16.560
They were murdered to protect the world.

53:18.528 --> 53:20.730
But now, Dillon and Abigail have returned in the form

53:20.764 --> 53:23.300
of you and Beth so that the Antichrist can be born--

53:23.333 --> 53:26.036
The Antichrist?!

53:26.069 --> 53:27.671
What are you talking about? That shit isn't real.

53:29.673 --> 53:31.875
-And Beth is dead. -For now.

53:33.510 --> 53:34.778
Nothing need be forever.

53:37.447 --> 53:39.349
[tense instrumental music]

53:47.457 --> 53:49.492
[footsteps approaching]

53:49.526 --> 53:52.062
[Paige] Hey.

53:52.095 --> 53:55.599
I know Simon wants to explain it all away, but...

53:55.632 --> 53:57.067
Vickie's phone is a bad sign!

53:57.100 --> 53:59.636
We should... we should call the police.

53:59.669 --> 54:02.672
Do it if you want, but I have a feeling they're gonna tell us

54:02.706 --> 54:04.307
to wait the 48 hours.

54:05.976 --> 54:07.877
Hey, I'm with you about everything that's happening,

54:07.911 --> 54:11.014
but the way Vickie lives her life, she could show up

54:11.047 --> 54:13.650
happy, high and giving us the finger in 48 days.

54:13.683 --> 54:15.952
[Helen chuckles]

54:15.986 --> 54:18.488
Oh, I miss the city.

54:18.521 --> 54:21.891
The glow, the noise, cell reception.

54:23.526 --> 54:26.363
This place, it's...

54:26.396 --> 54:27.964
pitch black.

54:29.132 --> 54:31.568
Silent like... death.

54:31.601 --> 54:33.470
[ominous instrumental music]

54:38.141 --> 54:39.676
Part of me wishes we'd never come.

54:48.018 --> 54:51.521
-Uh, I'm sorry. I-- -I'm sorry. No, it's fine.

54:51.554 --> 54:54.324
-I get it. I get it. -[door shuts]

54:55.492 --> 54:56.893
I think Grant's back.

55:00.997 --> 55:04.434
Like I've been telling you, Aunt Stephanie,

55:04.467 --> 55:06.636
she drives Beth to suicide, now she's trying to scare

55:06.670 --> 55:09.439
the shit out of you, out of all of us,

55:09.472 --> 55:11.074
hell, maybe she even put the bones in the closet

55:11.107 --> 55:13.843
up in the attic, all so we return to the city

55:13.877 --> 55:16.012
and never come back, and she inherits everything.

55:16.046 --> 55:20.717
Or... maybe it's real. [sighs]

55:20.750 --> 55:23.019
Some weird shit's been happening, and...

55:23.053 --> 55:25.722
you can blame Aunt Stephanie and her weed all you want,

55:25.755 --> 55:28.591
but even my goddamn camera's been acting up.

55:28.625 --> 55:30.493
Jesus Christ.

55:30.527 --> 55:32.162
And you are either way more scared than the rest of us

55:32.195 --> 55:35.832
so you're searching for rational explanations,

55:35.865 --> 55:37.734
or you're trying to fuck with us.

55:37.767 --> 55:39.736
Seriously, Helen?

55:39.769 --> 55:42.172
You think I'm doing all of this just to get sole custody

55:42.205 --> 55:45.108
of some... some crappy house in a broke-ass town?

55:45.141 --> 55:47.610
You were the one who jumped at the idea of selling it.

55:47.644 --> 55:49.979
I don't know, maybe you need the money.

55:50.013 --> 55:52.816
I've been being modest. I'm loaded.

55:52.849 --> 55:54.718
-All right? -[Helen scoffs]

55:54.751 --> 55:56.820
My share of this place would just be pocket change.

55:56.853 --> 55:59.189
Okay, so to get back at us, then.

55:59.222 --> 56:02.959
Guys! Guys, I'm so over this.

56:02.992 --> 56:05.462
Now, I'm gonna go smoke this kickass weed,

56:05.495 --> 56:08.631
conk out, and then get my ass out of town in the morning.

56:08.665 --> 56:11.534
And then, I'm going to go join Vickie and press eject

56:11.568 --> 56:14.504
on this fucked-up little paranoid friend group of ours.

56:14.537 --> 56:17.907
And if you have any sense, you will do the same.

56:46.736 --> 56:49.172
Payback is a bitch.

56:49.205 --> 56:52.675
Simon, you fucking asshole! Get out!

56:52.709 --> 56:56.079
[in deep voice] Call me the Great Goat Lord.

56:56.112 --> 56:59.916
Heh! And after all the shit you accused me of earlier...

56:59.949 --> 57:02.852
you deserved this. [chuckles]

57:02.886 --> 57:04.754
[Helen] Fucking jerk.

[unsettling instrumental music]

57:09.025 --> 57:10.927
[indistinct whispering]

Hello.

58:45.321 --> 58:48.124
-You're pregnant? -We are, Dillon.

58:56.132 --> 58:57.567
I'm not Dillon.

58:58.902 --> 59:00.603
[demonic voice] And I'm not Beth.

59:37.006 --> 59:39.742
Why did I come back here to the Gref House?

59:39.776 --> 59:42.378
Why didn't I just run away

59:42.412 --> 59:45.949
to Italy or Australia like I always wanted?

59:48.151 --> 59:50.253
College was supposed to be an escape.

59:53.122 --> 59:54.724
And now, thanks to Aunt Stephanie,

59:54.757 --> 59:57.193
I've figured out the truth...

59:58.962 --> 01:00:00.730
what's been hidden behind those doors

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:02.298
that my parents wouldn't talk about.

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:08.271
The truth about... me.

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:11.808
About Grant. About our fate.

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:18.348
Which, if you're watching this, means that...

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.918
I couldn't avoid it.

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:26.089
Grant.

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:28.658
I failed.

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:32.929
Now, it's up to you.

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:40.269
[intriguing instrumental music]

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:01.891
[Simon sighs]

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:06.129
Ah, fuck, Grant!

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:10.366
Oh, as if this house isn't creepy enough.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.904
-Can you feel her too? -"Feel" who?

01:01:14.937 --> 01:01:16.773
Beth.

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:20.309
Um... No.

01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:23.379
No one can. Beth's dead.

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.848
Of course, you wouldn't feel her.

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.316
You two were never close.

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:31.988
-Vickie called it. -Called what?

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.222
The randomness of our connections.

01:01:35.291 --> 01:01:37.160
In the grand scheme of things, you could've been really...

01:01:39.796 --> 01:01:41.064
...anyone.

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:45.068
Dude, are you sleepwalking right now?

[eerie ambient music]

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:01.210
[Grant] Beth.

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:03.146
You're alive.

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:06.048
Thank God.

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:10.086
[demonic voice] I'm not Beth.

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:13.890
[demonic voice] And I am not alive...

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:15.258
but that won't stop you and me.

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:18.194

-Help! Help me! -Oh, my God! What happened?

01:03:35.444 --> 01:03:38.314
[Grant] Shit! Come on, quick. Shit, shit, shit. Come on.

01:03:38.347 --> 01:03:40.883
-Put him on the table! -Okay, come on. Come on, Simon.

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:44.120
Come on, buddy. Fuck! Fuck!

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:48.057
Grant, find a clean dish towel. Soak it under hot water.

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:51.427
We need to apply pressure and pack the wound. All right.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:54.096
-[Simon gasping] -[Paige] Stay with us. Come on!

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:58.301
-Hey! Hey, Simon! -Fuck, dude! Here, here, here!

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:01.003
-Simon?! Simon! Come on! -Grant. Grant, step back.

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:02.872
-No. -Grant, he's gone.

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.275

[Stephanie gasps]

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:22.391
[Stephanie] What... what happened?

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:26.529
I--I stabbed him... in--in the chest.

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:29.632
-It was an accident. -[Grant cries softly]

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:32.368
He's dead.

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:34.370
Are you sure? Maybe we should call 911--

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:36.239
I tried to stop the bleeding.

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:38.908
It was too late.

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.246
[Stephanie sighs] It's the family.

01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:47.083
This cursed place.

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:52.388
It's never satisfied. It's never satiated.

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:54.991
-I warned you, all of you! -Enough!

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:58.461
Our friend is dead.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:02.531
Helen. HELEN!

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:04.467

-[Grant] Oh, my God. -[footsteps approaching]

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:24.553
-Where is she? -I don't know. I don't know.

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:28.124
-Oh, my God! Oh! -Do you know?

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:32.228
Me? What do you mean?

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:34.297
It feels like you've been subtly manipulating things

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:35.631
since we got there.

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:36.432
-Am I crazy, Grant? -Nope.

01:05:38.467 --> 01:05:41.170
That's the first thing I've heard that doesn't sound crazy.

01:05:41.203 --> 01:05:44.073
You drugged us, put insane thoughts into Grant's head!

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:45.775
I have been warning you!

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:47.510
With shit that's feeding our paranoia!

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.245
Why would I do that?!

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:51.147
So you could get your hands on this house!

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.748
-Oh, my God! -Maybe you killed your niece.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.585
-Beth killed herself. -How the fuck do we know that?

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:58.487
-'Cause you told us? -I'm going home.

01:05:58.521 --> 01:06:00.523
-The police-- -No, no, no!

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:03.225
Are you the one that's been creeping around this house?

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:05.628
Was it you up in the attic, trying to freak us out?

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:07.530
-Get out of my way! -HEY!

01:06:07.563 --> 01:06:09.498
-Hey! -Leave me alone!

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:12.735
HEY! You tell us right now what the fuck you did to our friends!

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:14.437
I had nothing to do with any of this.

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:21.644
Asmodeus? No...

01:06:21.677 --> 01:06:23.612
-No! Oh! -[Grant] Shit!

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.282
She's... Oh.

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:32.021
[both breathing heavily]

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:44.633
[footsteps approaching]

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:57.279
Here. Something to settle both our nerves.

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:59.181
Thank you.

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:05.488
-[Grant] How did she fall? -[Paige] I don't know.

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:08.758
It was all so confusing.

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:11.794
What are we gonna do?

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.865
Grant.

01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:18.234
No police, okay? Uh...

01:07:19.568 --> 01:07:21.137
I have a record.

01:07:22.605 --> 01:07:24.306
With Simon and my past...

01:07:26.575 --> 01:07:28.444
can we just talk this out first?

01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:31.280
-Yeah? -Okay.

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:39.321
That name she called out,

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:43.793
it was like she saw something... you think she did?

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:45.728
I think it was another one of her games.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.566
-And this time, it didn't work. -So this was all Stephanie?

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.570
I can't believe I fell for that shit.

01:07:57.173 --> 01:07:59.608
We all did, to some extent.

01:07:59.642 --> 01:08:01.710
Because of her, I killed Simon.

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:04.113
She knew exactly what she was doing.

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:06.715
It just doesn't make any sense.

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:14.356
Why are you so calm? Hey.

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:20.663
-Did you fucking call them? -No, of course not.

01:08:20.696 --> 01:08:23.165
Stephanie must have.

01:08:23.199 --> 01:08:24.700
Oh...

01:08:26.335 --> 01:08:27.369
[groans]

01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:32.174
[sighs] Grant.

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:34.844
-[knocking] -You just lie there.

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.445
And I'll take care of everything.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.515
[tense instrumental music]

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:46.589
-Evening. -Hello, Officer.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.657
-Is there a problem? -Uh, yeah.

01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:51.760
I had a call about a disturbance, some screaming.

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:54.964
Oh. Well, there's been some carrying on, but...

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.832
no, no screaming.

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:58.934
-[groans] -Who called you?

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:01.637
[sighs] Let me guess, Stephanie Gref?

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.873
Yeah... Well, if you want to be pressing charges

01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:05.941
against anyone, it's her.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.410
My friends have been smoking Aunt Stephanie's crazy weed.

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:11.514
Oh, jeez. Not the first time I've had that call.

01:09:11.547 --> 01:09:14.450
-Uh-huh. -Where are your friends, anyway?

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:17.419
Oh, well, I actually sent them all to bed to sleep it off.

01:09:17.453 --> 01:09:20.523
I don't imbibe myself, resident teetotaller,

01:09:20.556 --> 01:09:22.791
which they love to remind me about.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.793
I just want to make sure no one thinks they can fly

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:27.863
out of a window or, God forbid, choke on their own vomit.

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:30.866
[panting] [groans]

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:34.770
-Help. -Oh, Grant!

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:38.307
Grant, come over here. All right. I got you.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.209
There we go. You really need to sleep this off.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:44.847
Ever since they made this shit legal,

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.882
we've had to deal with calls like this.

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:48.784
And I've told Stephanie,

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:50.886
her weed is way too strong.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.622
Oh, understatement of the year! I mean, look at him.

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:55.591
[Officer] I even had it tested once.

01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:58.561
I thought that there has to be something else in it.

01:09:58.594 --> 01:10:01.697
Yeah, well, as you can see, no screaming.

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:04.600
And I--I really should be getting this one to bed.

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:10.039
You're not gonna die, young man. You're gonna sleep it off.

01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:11.907
And you're gonna have a hell of a story to tell in the morning.

01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:13.709
Yeah. You hear that, Grant?

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:15.945
-Thank you. Thank you, Officer. -Yeah.

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.822
[lock clicks]

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.857
Well, we're lucky I didn't have to kill him.

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:31.894
[panting] You...

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:36.799
-Why? -Come on, Grant.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:40.803
It's you and Beth.

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:43.405
All of this is.

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:46.342
Beth... Beth's dead.

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:50.813
Oh... Oh.

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:58.053
The veil between life and death is diaphanous.

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:00.856
It can be breached.

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:05.928
We will bring your love back.

01:11:07.029 --> 01:11:08.964
-Together. -You...

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:11.433
-[thudding] -[groans]

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.371
Who are you?

01:11:15.404 --> 01:11:18.841
Not who. What.

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:24.113
[demonic voice] Asmodeus. Your saviour.

01:11:24.146 --> 01:11:26.849
[rising suspenseful music]

01:11:29.852 --> 01:11:32.421
[Grant grunting]

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:34.356
[chain rattling]

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:37.793
[Grant grunting]

01:11:39.428 --> 01:11:41.063
How are you doing over there, Grant?

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:44.933
Just wondering if you're gonna kill me next.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.835
Of course not.

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:48.904
Then why am I chained up?!

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:50.839
Well, once you get the importance of your role

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:52.541
through that thick skull of yours, I'll free you.

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:56.578
But we have bigger issues to discuss first.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.449
Like what?

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.985
Simple. Beth.

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:09.458
[Beth] Call me old-fashioned, Grant, I just...

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:12.728
I want to wait. Okay?

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:15.664
[Grant] Okay.

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:18.867
You wanted Beth.

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:22.538
I just wanted to make sure you got her.

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:27.009
[Paige] Her thoughts...

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:29.611
her eyes...

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:31.547
her pleasure...

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:34.616
on Grant.

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.687
Alone.

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:41.523
[sighs]

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.661
I found where Paige

01:12:45.694 --> 01:12:47.596
hides her secret stash.

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:49.164
Her stash?

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.866
Since when does Paige have a...

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:53.936
-Yeah. -You know what?

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.405
I really don't care.

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:01.510
This is what you get for not sharing. Hah!

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:05.147
Oh, we are gonna have some fun tonight.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.615
That wasn't pot.

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:11.120
So... it was some kind of love drug?

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:13.122
The others stole what I made for the two of you.

01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:18.460
-[sighs] -And wound up in your bed.

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:20.195
[soft electronic music]

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:38.981
[soft electronic music]

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.731
[soft electronic music]

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:11.847
-That night ruined everything. -[Paige sighs]

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.782
It was a problem.

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:18.086
But one night can't undo your destiny.

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.828
Your family...

01:14:25.861 --> 01:14:27.663
Faodhagain.

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:31.900
Beth's family... Gref.

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:35.571
Both tied to the dark arts,

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:38.674
both tied to each other.

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:44.680
And when Beth discovered your destinies...

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:48.784
...she summoned me.

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:53.021
-Paige, please-- -There is no Paige, Grant.

01:14:53.055 --> 01:14:54.656
There never was.

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:58.126
Only Asmodeus.

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:02.731
[Grant shudders]

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:07.636
And I introduced you to her.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:12.774
-You... -Yes.

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:16.879
Me.

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.648
And that game I got you all playing...

01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:22.718
Marry, fuck, kill...

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:26.188
it is an old spell

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:28.657
suited to our purposes...

01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:33.195
Bind, bed, bury.

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:38.000
What purposes? Beth's dead.

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:39.935
And you're talking about marriage,

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:41.770
about us being together?

01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:43.839
Oh, it doesn't have to be wedlock.

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.808
It's binding,

01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:49.845
connecting, attaching.

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:54.716
And as for Beth's death...

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.353
...we're going to bring her back.

01:16:03.825 --> 01:16:05.227
What?

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.629
I convinced Beth to add you all to that will,

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:11.133
to bring you all here.

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:17.072
And so now, we are going to finish what Beth started.

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:18.907
[whoosh]

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:22.210
[Beth] Exorcizamus et, omnis spiritus,

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:25.681
om satanica potestas!

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:29.618
[Beth gasps and whimpers]

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:37.960
Paige?

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:42.230
[demonic voice] I prefer Asmodeus.

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:44.132
It's been you?

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:47.235
[demonic voice] Aiding... guiding you

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:50.005
to what must come to be.

01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:53.375
Help me, Grant.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:58.180
Help me bring Beth back to the mortal plane.

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:02.384
If you bind a piece

01:17:02.417 --> 01:17:05.087
of all three of your carnal friends together,

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.089
out of their sacrifice,

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:10.125
the sweet Beth you knew

01:17:10.158 --> 01:17:13.061
and loved will return.

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:16.164
-Stronger. -[Grant shudders]

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:19.101
Ready to assume her place by your side.

01:17:19.134 --> 01:17:22.170
Their sacrifice? You fucking murdered them!

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:27.075
-I murdered them. -Oh, Grant.

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:30.345
Hey...

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:34.683
Given the chance, they would do the same to you.

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:39.955
Marry, fuck, kill.

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:45.027
-It's a stupid game. -They all chose you to murder.

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:47.829
Hmm?

01:17:54.002 --> 01:17:56.204
There is brutal truth

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:57.773
to that game.

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:03.445
They mocked you behind your back, and you felt it.

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:08.383
You were great once. What are you now?

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:09.384
Hmm?

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:14.489
Wouldn't you rather thrive in power

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.792
with your fated love, Beth?

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:20.996
Instead of spending

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:24.900
the rest of your life wandering,

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:27.869
lost, like you have been,

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:32.040
for the next... 30, 40, 50 years?

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:35.343
A life...

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:40.048
fully inconsequential?

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:41.983
[rising tense music]

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.389
Yes, that's it.

01:18:49.324 --> 01:18:50.892
[chains rattling]

01:18:55.497 --> 01:18:57.966
What do I need to do?

01:18:57.999 --> 01:18:59.768
[demonic voice] Cut my throat.

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:12.948
[rising suspenseful music]

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:21.389
[demonic voice] I humbly offer you my throat.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:27.562
Bind, bed, bury.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.498
What is thine will?

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:34.002
Love has all the power,

01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:36.838
lust will devour,

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:40.008
and the heart shall never be still.

-[ominous instrumental music] -[singers chanting]

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:45.580

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:48.583
tasa Asmodeus.

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:53.088
Deyan anay tasa Asmodeus!

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:57.492
DEYAN ANAY TASA ASMODEUS!

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:59.895
Now, Grant! Now!

[knife clatters]

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:17.612
[Grant breathes heavily]

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:32.260
Beth! Hey.

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:35.063
Oh... Oh, Beth.

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:38.266
Oh...

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.235
[ethereal music]

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.377

01:21:19.241 --> 01:21:22.310
[singer vocalizing]

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:43.598
How are we going to explain any of this?

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:48.370
Our friends disappeared.

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:51.439
You're back from the dead.

01:21:52.507 --> 01:21:54.376
You know what?

01:21:56.077 --> 01:21:58.113
We blame it all on Stephanie.

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:01.116
Yeah.

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:03.418
She deserves it. [sighs]

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:05.520
And she's enough of a nut that everyone will believe it.

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.259
We're together now.

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:16.231
We're going to spend the rest of our lives together.

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:21.436
Rebuild this family... this town.

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:26.107
And rule it like the royalty I now know we are.

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:34.649
Our child will rule the world.

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.155
-I... -Shh. Shh.

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:48.530
But the most incredible thing...

01:22:51.499 --> 01:22:53.535
...is how you risked your own life

01:22:53.568 --> 01:22:55.570
just to bring us back together.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:02.110
I've returned the favour.

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:03.445
I've conjured you.

01:23:05.447 --> 01:23:07.048
And now, here you are.

01:23:10.552 --> 01:23:12.687
-It wasn't a love spell, Grant. -Hmm.

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:17.492
Love... lust...

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:18.827

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:20.362
whatever it was,

01:23:21.429 --> 01:23:23.031
it was for me.

01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:26.201
It was for you...

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:28.470
but not for love.

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:31.706
Hate.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.809
A hate spell

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:37.312
to end the evil of my family,

01:23:37.345 --> 01:23:41.182
of your family... to end it all.

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:43.084
[tense instrumental music]

01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:47.222
