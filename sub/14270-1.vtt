WEBVTT

00:03.329 --> 00:06.025
There are no limits to the imagination.

00:06.966 --> 00:10.868
And man's ability to make reality
out of his visions...

00:11.337 --> 00:13.100
is his greatest strength.

00:13.973 --> 00:18.808
Through this skill he has been able
to conquer time and space.

00:19.812 --> 00:23.048
The story you are about to see
takes place...

00:23.148 --> 00:26.914
after man has solved
the complex mysteries of space travel.

00:27.887 --> 00:29.912
The year is 2001.

00:31.457 --> 00:33.220
Life is changed now.

00:33.626 --> 00:38.290
The planet Earth is no longer racked
by wars and threats of annihilation.

00:39.365 --> 00:41.734
Man has learned to live with himself.

00:41.834 --> 00:42.926
Zero.

00:56.882 --> 01:00.841
The United Nations is the sole
governing body of the world...

01:01.053 --> 01:04.113
and the great hunger now is for knowledge.

01:05.224 --> 01:08.427
All the planets near the sun,
including Saturn...

01:08.527 --> 01:11.860
have been explored
and chartered by the UN space fleet.

01:12.998 --> 01:17.230
But as yet, no sign of life in any form
has been discovered.

01:18.470 --> 01:22.736
The search goes on,
and systematic exploration continues.

01:24.743 --> 01:26.812
Spaceship Explorer 12...

01:26.912 --> 01:29.982
is now on a mission to survey, land...

01:30.082 --> 01:33.574
and investigate
the seventh planet, Uranus.

02:13.826 --> 02:15.555
We got an extra passenger.

02:16.362 --> 02:17.556
She's new.

02:17.863 --> 02:19.228
Who is she, Don?

02:19.698 --> 02:23.498
Sorry, Commander, this is private stock.
Name's Greta Tyson.

02:25.571 --> 02:29.405
Haven't met her myself yet,
but I worked and schemed for two months.

02:29.608 --> 02:33.874
Finally got a date with her tonight,
and they had to call this U-Day.

02:37.549 --> 02:40.185
You look like you could
go for her yourself, Commander.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.788
Don't tell me you're looking for romance.

02:42.888 --> 02:46.517
No, Sullivan. Love is one luxury
I've never had time for.

02:46.625 --> 02:50.493
- It's no problem for me, sir.
- No, Don, for you it's a hobby.

02:51.563 --> 02:54.464
Why don't you find one girl
and settle down?

02:55.367 --> 02:58.200
"You and your wife
can make a career of it." Me?

02:58.704 --> 03:01.798
I'm like the commander.
Space is my vocation.

03:02.341 --> 03:04.673
Women, that's my avocation.

03:05.244 --> 03:06.712
Like food with Barry.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.114
O'Sullivan, we've all got some vice.

03:09.214 --> 03:10.649
Mine's safer than yours.

03:10.749 --> 03:14.720
And that's my advice to Karl,
in case he has any ideas about women.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.947
There's plenty of time, kid.

03:17.189 --> 03:19.589
In Germany where I lived...

03:20.192 --> 03:22.922
there was a girl, Ursula.

03:24.963 --> 03:27.761
But I never really got
to know her very well.

03:27.866 --> 03:30.202
Maybe when we get back, I'll line you up.

03:30.302 --> 03:33.829
There was a girl, Lisa, a real chick.

03:34.573 --> 03:36.370
She was German, too.

03:37.209 --> 03:39.143
A UN biological expert.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.980
Boy, was she biological!

03:42.881 --> 03:46.112
I wish I could have taught her
my kind of biology.

03:47.086 --> 03:49.646
Okay, now, let's get back to space.

03:49.755 --> 03:53.282
Check out, and then we'll study
our flight instructions.

04:06.672 --> 04:08.299
Don, chart info.

04:09.341 --> 04:10.603
Yes, sir.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.214
We passed the moon
12 and a half minutes ago.

04:15.314 --> 04:17.649
Should be sighting Mars
in about 40 minutes.

04:17.749 --> 04:19.875
On schedule, on course, sir.

04:20.017 --> 04:22.350
Barry, radio and radar check.

04:22.955 --> 04:24.256
Checks out, Commander.

04:24.356 --> 04:28.725
Spoke to HQ, Base 7. Loud and clear,
right on schedule, operation normal.

04:30.596 --> 04:31.596
Karl?

04:32.631 --> 04:34.223
Radiation normal.

04:34.366 --> 04:37.096
No signs of meteors
or other alien objects.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.195
Svend?

04:40.405 --> 04:42.241
All in order, Commander.

04:42.341 --> 04:44.832
Atomic units functioning perfectly.

04:45.644 --> 04:48.204
- Those motors are beautiful.
- Right.

04:48.814 --> 04:51.450
Now, let's get down
to flight instructions.

04:51.550 --> 04:54.219
We were all briefed by control
before we left...

04:54.319 --> 04:56.310
but let's go over it once more.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.254
- Don, will you please read them?
- Yes, sir.

05:04.897 --> 05:08.133
We are to follow the route of
the other Explorer ships past Mars...

05:08.233 --> 05:11.760
Jupiter, and Saturn,
then on pre-set automatic to Uranus.

05:12.638 --> 05:16.275
We are to circle the planet, survey,
and report before landing.

05:16.375 --> 05:19.645
Some sort of radiation signal
has been traced to this planet.

05:19.745 --> 05:23.875
And we are to investigate.
But there's no real expectation of life.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.920
Sure, there's a sweet chance of that
at 200 degrees below zero.

05:28.020 --> 05:30.856
Our mission is to land,
search the planet carefully...

05:30.956 --> 05:35.893
check for the source of radiation signals
and for any sign of life, past or present.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.662
We're allowed only 10 days,
or we lose our trajectory.

05:40.232 --> 05:43.167
Is that understood?
10 days is all we have.

05:44.670 --> 05:46.160
Any questions?

05:46.538 --> 05:47.937
Excuse me, sir...

05:48.340 --> 05:50.672
this is my first flight, and...

05:51.076 --> 05:54.146
I understand.
We all got the jitters the first time out.

05:54.246 --> 05:56.115
Take it easy. You'll be okay.

05:56.215 --> 06:00.185
Why don't we open the ports and let the
boy get his first look at Miss Universe?

06:00.285 --> 06:02.981
You know, there's nothing
like that first look.

06:12.931 --> 06:15.422
Well, there she is, Karl. The universe.

06:45.931 --> 06:47.125
Approaching Uranus.

06:47.266 --> 06:49.101
Getting ready to go into orbit.

06:49.201 --> 06:52.659
Acknowledged mark, your approach
is chartered. Start signal from 00:05.

06:54.072 --> 06:56.097
This is Explorer 12.

06:56.441 --> 06:58.102
Wilco and out.

06:59.378 --> 07:01.812
Ready to cut deceleration rockets.

07:02.180 --> 07:04.876
Deceleration rockets' cut-off ready, sir.

07:05.183 --> 07:06.810
Fuel consumption?

07:06.985 --> 07:08.646
Normal and steady.

07:09.454 --> 07:12.821
Rig for weightlessness.
Duration, two minutes.

07:33.879 --> 07:35.914
Ten seconds to orbital position.

07:36.014 --> 07:37.276
Stand by.

07:38.550 --> 07:40.848
Three, two, one.

07:41.153 --> 07:42.711
Power off.

07:45.190 --> 07:46.714
We're in orbit.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.643
My last fresh-frozen galaxial apple.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.852
Stand by for atmosphere entry.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.352
Ready to fire retrorockets.

08:24.830 --> 08:25.990
Cut in!

08:29.434 --> 08:30.560
Don!

08:32.636 --> 08:33.797
Karl!

08:35.073 --> 08:36.131
Svend!

08:49.187 --> 08:50.187
Come!

08:51.490 --> 08:54.857
I have waited long for this moment.

08:56.628 --> 08:59.222
Give me your minds.

09:00.732 --> 09:03.223
Your innermost thoughts.

09:07.939 --> 09:10.430
You are powerless.

09:12.444 --> 09:16.175
I shall drain your minds...

09:17.682 --> 09:21.243
and bend your will to mine.

09:28.260 --> 09:31.354
You will submit...

09:31.930 --> 09:34.499
and I shall...

09:34.599 --> 09:36.089
possess you.

09:39.471 --> 09:42.872
Through your minds and bodies...

09:44.409 --> 09:47.674
I will rule you...

09:48.547 --> 09:51.710
and make your world mine.

10:25.884 --> 10:27.317
What happened?

10:27.919 --> 10:29.716
I guess we all blacked out.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.252
But for how long?

10:31.356 --> 10:35.087
The chronometer shows a lapse
of nearly two hours.

10:35.861 --> 10:38.489
Two hours, and how many days?

10:38.830 --> 10:40.491
- What do you mean?
- This.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.498
It was fresh. I just took it out.

10:44.002 --> 10:45.594
Now it's rotten.

10:46.137 --> 10:47.604
In two hours?

10:49.941 --> 10:52.136
Matter can't react like that.

10:54.579 --> 10:58.447
All right, everybody, snap out of it.
We'll figure that out later.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.452
Right now, we land. Don?

11:00.552 --> 11:03.043
- Still in orbit, sir.
- Stand by.

11:03.388 --> 11:05.515
Ready to fire retrorockets.

11:06.191 --> 11:07.385
Cut in.

11:11.563 --> 11:13.165
What's the gravity pull?

11:13.265 --> 11:15.434
1.05 Earth standard, sir.

11:15.534 --> 11:18.469
- Ready braking rockets.
- Braking rockets ready, sir.

11:19.404 --> 11:20.871
Fire rockets.

11:51.469 --> 11:54.563
I wonder if they'll
have a welcome celebration.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.674
Open the viewport, Don. Let's have a look.

12:13.124 --> 12:16.059
I see it, but I don't believe it.

12:17.329 --> 12:19.354
Frozen ammonia, they said.

12:20.065 --> 12:22.590
Helium, hydrogen and methane gases.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.863
A temperature of minus 200.

12:28.239 --> 12:29.239
Nothing like this.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.609
Karl, what's the radiometer reading?

12:46.358 --> 12:48.986
Interior radiation, normal.

12:50.362 --> 12:52.193
Exterior radiation...

12:53.198 --> 12:54.198
normal.

12:56.001 --> 12:57.836
All right, let's get at it.

12:57.936 --> 13:01.139
We're not going to leave the ship
until all tests have been made...

13:01.239 --> 13:04.538
checked, and double-checked.
Begin atmosphere tests.

13:21.826 --> 13:23.760
Who opened the air lock?

13:29.134 --> 13:32.126
Fresh as a man could hope
from any atmosphere.

13:34.039 --> 13:37.304
It sure is an effective way
of inviting us outside.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.266
Get your guns.

14:27.826 --> 14:28.860
What?

14:28.960 --> 14:33.021
What's the matter, Svend?
You look as if you if had seen a ghost.

14:34.132 --> 14:35.827
Maybe I have.

14:36.401 --> 14:38.665
I have the strangest feeling...

14:39.104 --> 14:40.901
I've been here before.

14:41.406 --> 14:43.033
Déjà vu, that's all.

14:43.742 --> 14:47.678
- It's a trick of the imagination.
- No. It's not like that.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.415
You see, I do know this area very well.

14:52.650 --> 14:55.050
I spent my whole childhood there.

14:55.787 --> 14:56.879
Commander...

14:57.322 --> 14:58.448
over there...

14:59.023 --> 15:00.513
inside the forest...

15:01.159 --> 15:02.888
is a small stream.

15:03.261 --> 15:05.957
And there is a large stone
in the middle of it.

15:08.566 --> 15:11.194
Let's go. Keep your eyes open.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.895
It's exactly as I remember it.

15:50.942 --> 15:53.069
What do you make of it, sir?

15:54.279 --> 15:56.577
I haven't any answers now, Don.

15:58.283 --> 15:59.875
Not a breath of air.

16:00.852 --> 16:02.376
No animal life.

16:03.388 --> 16:06.016
Has any one of you seen anything alive?

16:51.970 --> 16:54.029
What do you make of this?

16:56.274 --> 16:57.673
Commander.

16:58.376 --> 16:59.604
Look at this.

17:00.511 --> 17:02.479
This plant has no roots.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.012
Don, try that bush. Pull it up.

17:22.467 --> 17:24.301
They're all the same.

17:24.402 --> 17:27.132
Everything looks all right on the surface.

17:27.704 --> 17:30.139
But how can it grow without roots?

17:31.042 --> 17:32.509
Barry! Look!

17:33.711 --> 17:35.201
An apple tree.

17:38.116 --> 17:39.549
Wait a minute.

17:40.652 --> 17:44.452
That tree wasn't here before.
And we passed right by here.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.492
We've got an Alice in Wonderland
forest here.

17:53.131 --> 17:55.934
Let's see how many
other surprises it has for us.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.002
Keep together. Come on.

18:31.102 --> 18:33.366
Commander! Don! Come here!

18:35.974 --> 18:37.441
Look at this.

18:37.642 --> 18:39.007
What is it?

18:39.310 --> 18:42.040
It's a barrier of some kind. See?

18:47.351 --> 18:51.456
- What do you make of it?
- It's like a wall, but it's almost invisible.

18:51.556 --> 18:54.457
Barry, Svend, circle around this thing.

18:58.463 --> 18:59.896
It's crazy.

19:00.465 --> 19:02.399
It looks like nothing.

19:05.603 --> 19:06.627
Careful.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.496
What is it, Eric?

19:09.874 --> 19:11.239
It feels...

19:12.443 --> 19:14.172
like an air cushion...

19:16.314 --> 19:18.805
but without any substance to it.

19:20.885 --> 19:22.853
There's a slight tingle.

19:23.654 --> 19:25.679
It seems to give a little.

19:27.859 --> 19:30.054
What do you think it is, sir?

19:31.429 --> 19:32.657
A field.

19:34.332 --> 19:35.822
A force field.

19:36.934 --> 19:38.231
A force field?

19:39.270 --> 19:42.171
It covers the whole area,
as far as I went.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.308
There's a clearing ahead.

19:44.408 --> 19:46.611
This wall goes across,
but I couldn't see the top.

19:46.711 --> 19:49.914
Looks like we're encircled by it.
I don't think it has an end.

19:50.014 --> 19:52.414
- Svend, get me a stick.
- Yes, sir.

19:55.453 --> 19:56.977
- Take this.
- Yes, sir.

20:18.376 --> 20:21.311
At least we know it can be penetrated.

20:21.612 --> 20:22.612
Yes...

20:23.047 --> 20:24.674
and that's all we know.

20:26.784 --> 20:28.945
We still have no idea...

20:29.787 --> 20:31.311
what it's like...

20:31.923 --> 20:33.413
on the other side.

20:33.524 --> 20:36.084
- I'll find out.
- No, Karl!

20:39.197 --> 20:40.197
Barry.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.632
Burns!

20:50.441 --> 20:53.467
His arm's frozen, just like ice.

20:59.050 --> 21:02.787
I don't agree with you, Commander.
It's too dangerous to go through the wall.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.857
We're to explore Uranus.
That's why we're here.

21:05.957 --> 21:07.117
I know that.

21:07.491 --> 21:09.118
We've got a job to do.

21:10.061 --> 21:13.064
If going through the wall is part of it,
we'll do it.

21:13.164 --> 21:15.655
But we haven't got enough to go on.

21:16.033 --> 21:17.694
No answers at all.

21:18.469 --> 21:20.869
We accomplish nothing by staying put.

21:21.005 --> 21:25.339
The answers we're looking for
are beyond that wall, not here.

21:25.977 --> 21:27.578
And just how do you know that?

21:27.678 --> 21:31.315
How do you know the solution
isn't right here, right in front of us?

21:31.415 --> 21:33.885
Because nothing in front of us is real.

21:33.985 --> 21:35.612
It doesn't exist.

21:36.754 --> 21:39.086
Doesn't exist? What do you mean?

21:40.057 --> 21:42.753
What we see cannot possibly be Uranus.

21:43.194 --> 21:46.721
It's as if we're in the middle
of a weird hallucination.

21:46.998 --> 21:49.967
It's weird, all right.
So what's your point?

21:51.135 --> 21:54.205
Everything we see has been taken
out of our minds.

21:54.305 --> 21:57.001
Svend's forest stream, the apple tree...

21:57.108 --> 22:00.271
something, someone,
has brought them to light.

22:00.745 --> 22:01.973
But who?

22:02.113 --> 22:05.173
Some power or some alien being
we cannot understand.

22:05.650 --> 22:07.777
The lad is resting fine now.

22:08.252 --> 22:09.480
Strange.

22:10.021 --> 22:13.758
His arm is completely healed.
It should have been frozen off.

22:13.858 --> 22:15.189
I don't get it.

22:15.359 --> 22:17.361
There's a lot of things we don't get.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.656
But I'm glad Karl's all right.

22:25.703 --> 22:29.230
Do you not find it right pleasing
to be here, Commander?

22:29.874 --> 22:32.741
It is like a beautiful spot
on the Emerald Isle.

22:34.111 --> 22:36.978
Complete with Uranian leprechauns.

22:37.982 --> 22:41.679
Now, me lad, a body shouldn't
make fun of the little people.

22:42.653 --> 22:44.021
Am I right, Commander?

22:44.121 --> 22:47.091
Or do city people like yourself
not believe in such matters?

22:47.191 --> 22:49.216
Faith and begorra, we do.

22:50.227 --> 22:52.718
Anyway, I'm not real city people...

22:53.164 --> 22:56.031
I was raised in a small village in Scone.

22:57.535 --> 23:01.301
Whitewashed houses and barns
with straw-thatched roofs.

23:03.607 --> 23:07.236
And we had our own little people
at Christmas time, Barry.

23:07.478 --> 23:09.275
The Yuletonte.

23:10.181 --> 23:13.884
We used to put some rice pudding
out for them on Christmas Eve.

23:13.984 --> 23:16.544
It was always gone the next morning.

23:17.188 --> 23:21.716
There were two beautiful birch trees
right outside our house.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.852
And I could see the old windmill
from my room.

23:27.198 --> 23:31.601
And on Saint Lucia's Day,
the prettiest girl in the village...

23:32.103 --> 23:35.038
would bring around
her special little cakes.

23:35.673 --> 23:38.972
I remember one girl. Her name was Ingrid.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.408
She looked like a queen.

23:41.645 --> 23:42.737
A goddess.

23:43.414 --> 23:45.609
What's the matter?

23:49.587 --> 23:52.023
Don, Barry, get your guns.
Svend, go back to the ship.

23:52.123 --> 23:54.458
Tell Karl everything and stay on the ship.

23:54.558 --> 23:55.820
Aye, sir.

23:59.530 --> 24:02.226
We're going to pay
that mirage a little visit.

24:46.710 --> 24:49.178
This is my father's barn.

24:50.214 --> 24:52.842
I thought you said it was an illusion.

26:07.157 --> 26:09.853
That door should lead to the house.

26:10.094 --> 26:11.584
Come on.

26:59.043 --> 27:00.340
Ingrid!

27:02.413 --> 27:03.744
Welcome, Eric.

27:05.916 --> 27:09.079
Barry, take a look through
the rest of the house.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.051
Don, stay here.

27:11.555 --> 27:12.988
Yes, sir.

27:15.559 --> 27:17.083
You are Ingrid?

27:17.828 --> 27:19.227
I am Ingrid.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.731
Where did you come from?

27:22.199 --> 27:23.291
Here.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.797
Who else lives here?

27:28.439 --> 27:29.439
No one.

27:30.274 --> 27:32.572
No one you don't wish to be here.

27:34.478 --> 27:36.969
- Nobody.
- All right. Back to the ship.

27:38.048 --> 27:40.618
- Wait a minute, sir.
- That's an order.

27:40.718 --> 27:41.946
Yes, sir.

27:47.925 --> 27:49.620
I'll be here, Eric...

27:50.094 --> 27:51.459
when you want me.

28:07.211 --> 28:08.979
Why the hasty retreat, sir?

28:09.079 --> 28:10.948
It was just getting interesting.

28:11.048 --> 28:13.482
Don't you realize what's going on?

28:13.851 --> 28:15.580
- Ingrid?
- Yes.

28:16.920 --> 28:17.920
Well!

28:18.155 --> 28:21.158
Whoever thought her up
really knows his business.

28:21.258 --> 28:22.793
We should have stayed, Eric.

28:22.893 --> 28:25.129
At least we could have talked to her.

28:25.229 --> 28:27.831
She might have given us
a couple of answers.

28:27.931 --> 28:30.627
At least she gave me a couple of ideas.

28:31.235 --> 28:33.430
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.

29:16.947 --> 29:18.778
Hi, darling.

29:20.718 --> 29:22.379
I remember you.

29:33.864 --> 29:36.492
- You are Lisa?
- Yes. Lisa.

29:37.768 --> 29:40.862
Will you come with me?
Just for a little while.

29:41.839 --> 29:43.170
I'd love to.

29:43.574 --> 29:46.944
But right now, duty calls.
You'll hear its voice any moment.

29:47.044 --> 29:48.102
Tonight?

29:49.146 --> 29:50.636
You can count on it.

30:00.824 --> 30:02.018
Don.

30:03.227 --> 30:04.819
Have you forgotten me?

30:05.229 --> 30:08.132
Greta, how could I forget about you?

30:08.232 --> 30:10.134
Well, it looked like you had.

30:10.234 --> 30:12.634
No, I haven't, and I'm not likely to.

30:14.438 --> 30:15.803
Well, then...

30:17.341 --> 30:19.002
let's go for a walk.

30:20.511 --> 30:23.674
You know, we could arrange
that another time.

30:24.048 --> 30:25.709
Why not this time?

30:26.050 --> 30:30.510
Suppose we find a cozy little place
to be alone for a while.

30:32.322 --> 30:33.789
I don't know.

30:34.391 --> 30:37.019
Darling, another time may be too late.

30:38.529 --> 30:39.689
Greta...

30:40.097 --> 30:42.900
there's nothing I'd like more than that.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.469
But duty calls. I have to go back.

30:45.569 --> 30:47.537
You'd better be careful.

30:48.205 --> 30:51.732
There's always the possibility
I won't be here again.

30:52.943 --> 30:56.435
Don, up here on the double.
The commander wants you.

30:57.281 --> 30:58.441
Roger.

30:59.717 --> 31:01.514
Sorry, baby, gotta go.

31:02.286 --> 31:03.954
I will see you again.

31:04.054 --> 31:07.217
I've no doubt you will, if you wish.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.618
I wish.

31:10.861 --> 31:12.624
One thing.

31:12.830 --> 31:13.830
Yes?

31:14.264 --> 31:17.961
You are real, aren't you? I mean...

31:36.220 --> 31:37.881
What kept you?

31:38.288 --> 31:39.755
Duty, sir.

31:40.524 --> 31:41.923
Interrogation.

31:42.192 --> 31:43.386
Go on.

31:44.628 --> 31:47.324
There were two more of them down there.

31:47.765 --> 31:51.166
- Two more girls.
- Figures, with you down there.

31:55.205 --> 31:57.173
I won't argue with that.

31:57.808 --> 32:00.244
Despite what's been happening here...

32:00.344 --> 32:04.246
the answers we must find
lie on the other side of that barrier.

32:04.414 --> 32:06.746
- We're going through.
- Makes sense.

32:07.284 --> 32:10.879
With the unknown factor out there,
that enclosure...

32:11.455 --> 32:15.289
Barry, you said it went
right across the clearing?

32:15.392 --> 32:17.261
Yes, sir. Right across the center.

32:17.361 --> 32:19.129
We're going through there.

32:19.229 --> 32:22.357
Six-hour oxygen cylinders, fully armed.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.197
Don?

32:24.434 --> 32:26.070
Karl, if you're okay.

32:26.170 --> 32:28.872
- I'm all right, sir.
- You'll go with me.

32:28.972 --> 32:31.508
Barry, Svend, stay here in the ship.

32:31.608 --> 32:33.974
- I'd like to come, sir.
- No.

32:34.912 --> 32:37.847
We're going through at 0700 hours.

32:38.582 --> 32:42.086
If we don't return in six hours,
go to the barrier.

32:42.186 --> 32:43.346
Don't cross.

32:44.488 --> 32:46.080
Give us an hour.

32:46.657 --> 32:50.559
If we don't show up, you'll know
you don't have to wait any longer.

32:51.762 --> 32:55.129
Your orders then are, take off at once...

32:57.100 --> 32:58.260
if possible.

32:59.803 --> 33:02.033
What do you mean, if possible?

33:02.973 --> 33:05.601
Let's hope we don't have to find out.

33:13.150 --> 33:15.710
- Intercom check. Karl?
- Check.

33:16.653 --> 33:17.653
Don?

33:17.888 --> 33:19.651
Loud and clear, sir.

33:21.225 --> 33:24.160
We still don't know
the effects of crossing...

33:24.995 --> 33:26.930
or if we can.

33:27.030 --> 33:29.362
- Let me go first, sir.
- No, Karl.

33:29.666 --> 33:31.065
That's my job.

33:35.239 --> 33:36.263
Don?

33:37.941 --> 33:39.533
Do you read me?

33:40.177 --> 33:42.042
Don? Come in.

33:59.296 --> 34:01.127
Why didn't you acknowledge?

34:01.398 --> 34:03.100
I didn't hear a thing, sir.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.761
I guess the radio waves
can't penetrate the force field.

34:09.373 --> 34:12.239
Uranus, the seventh planet.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.270
Karl, what's the radiation?

34:18.348 --> 34:21.385
700 roentgens plus per hour...

34:21.485 --> 34:22.975
and pulsating.

34:27.791 --> 34:29.053
Let's go.

35:04.995 --> 35:06.963
Karl, a radiation check.

35:12.002 --> 35:16.268
- In which direction is it strongest?
- It's almost impossible to tell.

35:16.840 --> 35:20.105
It seems to be a little stronger
in that direction.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.935
All right. We'll make a marker here.

35:50.273 --> 35:52.468
Hurry, Karl. Anchor my legs.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.948
All right, Don, stretch.

36:06.857 --> 36:10.224
- I can't hold on.
- I've got to move forward, Karl.

36:11.395 --> 36:13.022
Now, Don, reach.

36:13.997 --> 36:15.259
Come on.

36:19.102 --> 36:20.364
Hold on.

36:51.701 --> 36:53.191
Ammonia snow.

36:53.970 --> 36:56.632
So cold and dry, it has no adhesion.

36:57.441 --> 36:58.999
Like quicksand.

37:02.079 --> 37:03.444
Quicksnow.

37:04.314 --> 37:06.976
I'm glad you were here to pull me out.

37:08.785 --> 37:11.982
Stay on the rocks from now on,
as much as possible.

37:12.489 --> 37:14.013
And be careful.

37:14.691 --> 37:17.421
Yes, sir. And thank you, Eric.

38:12.249 --> 38:14.444
Razor sharp. Watch it.

38:14.985 --> 38:17.146
They can rip our suits open.

39:11.308 --> 39:13.299
Listen, do you hear that?

39:20.116 --> 39:22.084
Commander, look at this.

39:30.961 --> 39:32.326
What is it?

39:43.039 --> 39:46.497
That's the first sign of movement
we've seen out here.

39:46.943 --> 39:48.911
Could it be a lava flow?

39:49.546 --> 39:51.138
It looks molten.

39:52.215 --> 39:56.515
But how does that figure?
A molten mass and everything frozen solid?

40:03.293 --> 40:05.727
Look, it moved when I shot at it.

40:13.270 --> 40:15.738
You have come to me...

40:18.074 --> 40:20.736
feeble, stupid men...

40:23.013 --> 40:25.243
armed only with courage...

40:25.982 --> 40:28.177
and foolish weapons.

40:28.785 --> 40:31.549
You have come to destroy me...

40:32.155 --> 40:35.352
but my weapons are more powerful
than yours.

40:36.426 --> 40:38.053
Your own fears...

40:38.328 --> 40:41.764
have created the means
of your destruction.

40:42.632 --> 40:45.192
Come then! Challenge me!

40:46.269 --> 40:48.669
We shall see who survives.

41:08.391 --> 41:10.018
Quick, this way.

41:26.443 --> 41:28.274
Snap out of it! Karl!

42:20.797 --> 42:22.697
All right, Karl, Don...

42:23.500 --> 42:25.627
when I yell, run.

42:31.341 --> 42:32.430
Now!

43:16.653 --> 43:18.917
- Commander, I...
- Save it, Karl.

43:20.657 --> 43:24.260
That was quite a reception committee
our host dreamed up for us.

43:24.360 --> 43:27.227
Why couldn't he have thought
of something more pleasant?

43:27.397 --> 43:28.523
Eric.

43:32.302 --> 43:33.394
Don.

43:37.006 --> 43:38.769
Now, that's better.

43:40.710 --> 43:43.577
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Easy, Don.

43:44.147 --> 43:47.412
Look, Commander,
this kind of monster I can handle.

43:49.018 --> 43:52.010
No, Don. We're going back to the ship.

43:53.289 --> 43:55.553
We're overdue as of right now.

44:02.997 --> 44:07.161
Granted that something, some entity,
is able to create those things...

44:07.968 --> 44:10.459
taking them right out of our minds.

44:11.038 --> 44:13.529
What about that weird-eyed monster?

44:13.974 --> 44:15.943
It was of the rodent family.

44:16.043 --> 44:19.410
Couldn't possibly exist
in the temperature of Uranus.

44:20.181 --> 44:23.275
All right, where did it come from?

44:25.753 --> 44:27.015
From me.

44:28.923 --> 44:32.620
I have always had
an abnormal fear of rats.

44:37.498 --> 44:41.332
That's why I couldn't stand up
to that rat thing.

44:41.802 --> 44:43.133
Of course.

44:43.938 --> 44:45.303
That's it.

44:46.207 --> 44:48.471
Our deepest, greatest fears...

44:48.776 --> 44:51.711
are being dug up from our subconscious...

44:52.780 --> 44:56.450
by whatever the power is out there,
and pitted against us.

44:56.550 --> 44:58.575
There's something else now.

44:59.186 --> 45:00.278
What?

45:04.758 --> 45:07.695
Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question, Eric?

45:07.795 --> 45:08.955
Shoot.

45:09.897 --> 45:12.366
- Have you ever been in love?
- I don't see...

45:12.466 --> 45:15.094
Now, Eric. We're all in this together.

45:16.904 --> 45:18.838
No, I haven't.

45:19.840 --> 45:21.831
That little lady, Ingrid.

45:22.243 --> 45:25.041
Don't you think she's just about perfect?

45:26.347 --> 45:27.439
I do.

45:27.982 --> 45:29.745
There now, you see.

45:29.950 --> 45:34.512
It's not only our fears and weaknesses,
it's also our greatest desires.

45:35.756 --> 45:37.519
You're right, Barry.

45:37.992 --> 45:41.393
Our minds are being probed like mice.

45:42.530 --> 45:44.054
Lab specimens.

45:45.366 --> 45:49.336
Whoever's running this show
obviously doesn't want to kill us...

45:49.436 --> 45:51.131
outright, that is.

45:51.372 --> 45:53.107
It would be simple enough.

45:53.207 --> 45:56.506
Just make our little paradise
out there disappear.

45:57.745 --> 45:59.736
And now, I ask why.

46:01.048 --> 46:04.142
I can only think of one answer
that makes sense.

46:04.451 --> 46:05.850
What's that?

46:07.721 --> 46:10.019
To find out what makes us tick.

46:21.302 --> 46:24.738
That strange substance, on the mountain,
in the pit...

46:25.172 --> 46:26.662
What about it?

46:26.807 --> 46:30.766
The rat creature seemed to appear
just after Karl fired into it.

46:31.879 --> 46:34.712
- There could be a connection.
- There could.

46:35.182 --> 46:37.912
It seemed to withdraw into the mountain.

46:38.719 --> 46:42.177
There must be a passage, a tunnel,
or several of them.

46:42.823 --> 46:43.824
The cave.

46:43.924 --> 46:47.189
Exactly. That's where we'll have to go.

46:48.462 --> 46:52.421
But first, I'd like to gather
as much information as possible...

46:52.733 --> 46:57.295
and I'll see if I can learn anything
from that village girl.

47:00.908 --> 47:04.105
- We'll need to know as much as we can.
- Of course.

47:14.154 --> 47:15.746
Paradise Uranus.

47:16.624 --> 47:21.118
Complete with rats, several Eves,
and even your apples.

47:25.399 --> 47:27.162
I ask you, Ingrid...

47:27.568 --> 47:30.662
who, what is behind it all?

47:34.008 --> 47:37.205
- It is only little I know, Eric.
- Tell me.

47:39.680 --> 47:42.205
- It is the power.
- What power?

47:43.050 --> 47:46.508
There is a being,
a lone being on this planet.

47:47.321 --> 47:51.417
- Where does it come from?
- From space and time itself.

47:52.593 --> 47:53.787
Go on.

47:54.695 --> 47:57.892
It's the mind of this being, its brain.

47:58.799 --> 48:01.825
It can use its brain
at nearly full capacity.

48:02.870 --> 48:06.499
- Where is this being?
- Everywhere, in thought.

48:09.643 --> 48:12.737
It took over our minds
in the ship, didn't it?

48:13.947 --> 48:16.507
- Yes.
- Why doesn't it do that now?

48:18.318 --> 48:20.309
Conditions are not right.

48:20.487 --> 48:24.116
Out there, your minds were free and light.

48:25.993 --> 48:27.756
The weightlessness.

48:30.631 --> 48:32.428
How do you know all this?

48:33.367 --> 48:34.595
I...

48:35.569 --> 48:36.968
just do.

48:40.174 --> 48:43.769
And this being is creating all this?

48:48.782 --> 48:50.943
Then we'd better leave here.

48:54.455 --> 48:55.820
Right now.

48:56.256 --> 48:59.555
It will never let you go alive.

49:00.861 --> 49:03.261
Your courage is great...

49:04.665 --> 49:07.930
but I am still here.

49:09.670 --> 49:11.729
I will...

49:12.139 --> 49:15.006
destroy you.

49:20.914 --> 49:24.084
We'll have to be back here
in one hour and 50 minutes.

49:24.184 --> 49:25.708
Stay together.

49:26.887 --> 49:28.184
Let's go.

51:07.487 --> 51:09.079
Radiation, Karl?

51:12.659 --> 51:15.992
700 roentgens plus, and pulsating.

51:16.496 --> 51:17.895
Temperature?

51:18.532 --> 51:20.625
Minus 37 degrees.

51:21.335 --> 51:23.360
It's getting warmer.

51:26.940 --> 51:28.339
What's that?

51:31.712 --> 51:34.306
It's just the reflection of my torch.

51:54.468 --> 51:58.404
- We've been traveling for almost an hour.
- Don't you think we should turn back?

51:59.539 --> 52:01.871
We have plenty of oxygen yet.

52:05.345 --> 52:07.779
That blue light seems to pulsate.

52:13.253 --> 52:14.914
Let's take a look.

53:40.807 --> 53:43.503
The power. The alien being.

53:51.218 --> 53:52.583
Radiation?

53:59.092 --> 54:02.027
750, and pulsating, sir.

54:03.830 --> 54:07.197
The pulsation corresponds
exactly to that blue light.

54:07.634 --> 54:09.397
There's the answer.

54:09.503 --> 54:12.836
That brain thing sends out the radiation.

54:15.776 --> 54:17.767
We'll have to destroy it.

54:17.878 --> 54:19.607
Get away from here.

54:21.848 --> 54:23.748
Invaders...

54:24.251 --> 54:26.776
of my universe...

54:27.921 --> 54:29.980
you are doomed.

54:31.391 --> 54:34.849
Your destiny is to die.

55:03.090 --> 55:05.388
No good. Let's get out of here.

55:05.892 --> 55:07.883
Not that way, over here.

55:21.508 --> 55:24.778
We'll never make it up there
before that creature gets here.

55:24.878 --> 55:27.948
- We'll have to fight it.
- How? Nothing stops it.

55:28.048 --> 55:31.984
There's one chance. No time to explain.
Do as I do. Spread out.

55:41.862 --> 55:43.853
Aim for the rocks above.

56:06.786 --> 56:07.786
The oxygen.

56:07.854 --> 56:10.490
We've only got one-third left.
We better go back.

56:10.590 --> 56:12.785
We'll have to hurry. Come on.

57:08.682 --> 57:10.309
You're bleeding.

57:12.085 --> 57:15.248
My suit. It's torn. I'm losing air.

57:15.956 --> 57:18.481
- Come on. Give me a hand.
- No. Wait.

57:18.725 --> 57:22.456
We've only got a few minutes of air.
You'll never make it with me.

57:22.729 --> 57:24.560
- We can sure try.
- No.

57:25.198 --> 57:27.826
I can't stop my air from leaking out.

57:28.468 --> 57:32.268
- Come on.
- No. This is an order. Leave me here.

57:32.572 --> 57:33.800
I won't.

57:34.174 --> 57:36.540
Don, we'll have to stop the bleeding.

57:37.210 --> 57:39.644
- Let him bleed.
- What did you say?

57:39.879 --> 57:42.848
Let him bleed.
Remember the temperature here?

57:43.049 --> 57:46.348
The blood will freeze instantly,
and seal the tear.

57:46.553 --> 57:47.918
He's right.

57:54.794 --> 57:58.161
It's working, sir.
We'll get you out of here.

57:59.666 --> 58:02.567
Don't be a stubborn fool, Don.

58:03.336 --> 58:05.167
You'll never make it.

58:15.782 --> 58:17.010
Ingrid!

58:20.787 --> 58:22.186
Don't talk.

58:23.290 --> 58:25.417
- How?
- They brought you back.

58:26.393 --> 58:28.657
- The others?
- They're all fine.

58:29.396 --> 58:30.761
Lie still.

58:42.242 --> 58:44.369
What's the matter, darling?

58:45.612 --> 58:47.079
I don't know.

58:48.081 --> 58:50.379
I feel restless, uneasy.

58:50.617 --> 58:53.552
You're still a little weak, that's all.

58:55.021 --> 58:59.117
I guess I feel a little guilty,
having slept half the day away...

58:59.292 --> 59:01.027
when there's so much to be done.

59:01.127 --> 59:04.364
It's more than that.
You were unconscious for three days.

59:04.464 --> 59:05.556
What?

59:06.066 --> 59:08.935
Yes, they brought you here
more than three days ago.

59:09.035 --> 59:11.333
Where's Karl and Don? Get them.

59:14.074 --> 59:15.442
They're not here.

59:15.542 --> 59:18.812
- Not here? Where are they?
- Probably in the village.

59:18.912 --> 59:21.176
What the devil
are they doing in the village?

59:21.798 --> 59:23.993
Have you all lost your minds?

59:24.401 --> 59:27.928
Don, I didn't think you would fall for it.

59:29.472 --> 59:32.532
We all know that
nothing in this place is real.

59:33.677 --> 59:36.874
Not one of those girls really exists.

59:37.681 --> 59:42.641
The alien enemy is trying to destroy us
with our stupidity and our weaknesses.

59:42.886 --> 59:44.319
But you!

59:44.454 --> 59:47.753
You play right into his hands
just the same.

59:48.591 --> 59:50.456
We've still got time, sir.

59:50.894 --> 59:52.691
24 hours...

59:53.530 --> 59:56.433
and every hour brings us
further and further...

59:56.533 --> 59:58.967
from our optimum orbital position.

01:00:00.203 --> 01:00:03.297
Soon, we won't have fuel enough
to make it back.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.564
What can we do?

01:00:05.975 --> 01:00:09.502
We can figure out a way
to destroy that thing in the cave.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.915
Fire, sir?

01:00:12.015 --> 01:00:15.485
No, Don. There's no oxygen down there,
nothing will burn.

01:00:15.585 --> 01:00:17.320
An acetylene torch would.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:20.412
Too small.
Wouldn't even give it the hot foot.

01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:22.025
Barry's right.

01:00:22.125 --> 01:00:25.060
- Sir, couldn't we build one?
- Build a what?

01:00:25.462 --> 01:00:29.956
Some sort of modified acetylene torch
big enough to do the job.

01:00:30.533 --> 01:00:33.024
- The lad's got it.
- How about it?

01:00:33.136 --> 01:00:37.368
It can be done. Take a little work.
We've got enough of the compound.

01:00:37.774 --> 01:00:39.442
But we'll need a booster.

01:00:39.542 --> 01:00:42.978
We can draw liquid oxygen
from the ship's fuel system.

01:00:43.213 --> 01:00:46.316
Make a double wall,
dual-type tank to transport it in.

01:00:46.416 --> 01:00:47.542
Right.

01:00:48.084 --> 01:00:50.587
We can work at the blacksmith's shop
in the village.

01:00:50.687 --> 01:00:52.211
Okay. Let's go.

01:01:49.612 --> 01:01:50.704
Don?

01:01:51.214 --> 01:01:55.118
- Sorry, baby, can't talk now.
- That's not the way it used to be.

01:01:55.218 --> 01:01:59.985
- I've got more important things to do.
- Like destroying the alien?

01:02:04.527 --> 01:02:06.392
How did you know that?

01:02:06.563 --> 01:02:08.929
Really, you are naive, Don.

01:02:10.166 --> 01:02:11.827
Come on, darling.

01:02:11.968 --> 01:02:16.268
Let's forget all about it.
I have a much better idea.

01:02:21.277 --> 01:02:23.302
It won't do you any good.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.005
Not you, nor your race on Earth.

01:02:26.382 --> 01:02:30.318
- What about the Earth?
- Isn't it rather obvious by now?

01:02:31.221 --> 01:02:32.984
Spell it out for me.

01:02:33.823 --> 01:02:38.817
The Earth is going to be the new home
of this being you find so alien.

01:02:39.529 --> 01:02:41.190
The devil it will.

01:02:41.297 --> 01:02:43.900
If that thing ever gets on Earth,
they'll destroy it.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.524
Will they, Don?

01:02:47.337 --> 01:02:49.464
Why are you telling me this?

01:02:49.973 --> 01:02:52.305
Who do you think is telling you?

01:02:55.211 --> 01:02:58.180
Yes, your planet is rich...

01:02:58.915 --> 01:03:00.143
warm...

01:03:00.817 --> 01:03:02.751
filled with life.

01:03:03.453 --> 01:03:05.580
I shall go there...

01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:08.921
in one of your bodies.

01:03:10.193 --> 01:03:12.127
Man is weak.

01:03:13.463 --> 01:03:16.032
I shall make the terrors...

01:03:16.132 --> 01:03:20.364
that dwell in his own mind destroy him.

01:03:21.704 --> 01:03:24.264
And I shall bring a new race...

01:03:24.674 --> 01:03:26.073
into being.

01:03:43.593 --> 01:03:45.925
Nothing out there, either, sir.

01:03:46.062 --> 01:03:49.327
So, it's testing us to see
how dangerous we can be.

01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:53.364
Okay, we'll show it.

01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:56.429
Baby, you better work.

01:03:57.907 --> 01:03:59.841
The liquid oxygen tank?

01:04:00.877 --> 01:04:04.870
- Filled and ready, sir.
- Good. We'll start at 0600 tomorrow.

01:04:05.381 --> 01:04:09.875
We'll mount a guard here through the night.
Karl, you take the first tour.

01:04:11.821 --> 01:04:13.152
Good luck.

01:04:44.454 --> 01:04:46.752
Ursula, you better leave.

01:04:47.624 --> 01:04:50.252
- You don't want me?
- I didn't say that.

01:04:54.597 --> 01:04:56.360
I've waited for you.

01:04:57.066 --> 01:04:59.364
You're not real. Get away.

01:05:00.436 --> 01:05:01.733
Not real?

01:05:03.272 --> 01:05:05.604
Liebling, how can you say that?

01:05:06.909 --> 01:05:08.274
I love you.

01:05:09.612 --> 01:05:11.705
Go back and leave me alone.

01:05:13.049 --> 01:05:14.607
You look tired.

01:05:15.585 --> 01:05:17.780
No. I won't listen to you.

01:05:19.555 --> 01:05:22.046
Come on, darling, sit down.

01:05:22.692 --> 01:05:24.990
Just for a while. Come on.

01:05:26.763 --> 01:05:28.390
I won't hurt you.

01:05:32.669 --> 01:05:35.263
You still have your protection. Come.

01:06:42.238 --> 01:06:44.069
I guess I was tired.

01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:48.639
- I feel much better.
- I knew you would.

01:07:10.133 --> 01:07:12.897
- Let's hope this will work.
- It will.

01:07:13.603 --> 01:07:18.063
Just don't connect the liquid oxygen tank
until you're ready to use it.

01:07:18.441 --> 01:07:20.671
It might blow up in your face.

01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:23.701
Okay, we're ready. Let's get going.

01:07:34.857 --> 01:07:39.226
I'm leaving you alone here.
I'm sure you know why I chose you.

01:07:39.862 --> 01:07:41.097
Guess so.

01:07:41.197 --> 01:07:45.634
You think I'm the least likely
to fall for any of his tricks back here.

01:08:21.304 --> 01:08:25.104
It's your show, Karl.
You know what to do. We'll back you up.

01:08:26.075 --> 01:08:27.234
Right.

01:08:27.877 --> 01:08:30.277
Get ready. Hook it up.

01:08:40.488 --> 01:08:44.015
- It's ready, sir.
- All right, let him have it.

01:09:11.386 --> 01:09:12.752
Karl, back!

01:09:48.791 --> 01:09:51.760
Buried within it.

01:09:52.461 --> 01:09:54.258
We haven't a chance.

01:09:55.398 --> 01:09:57.923
Yes, we have. The liquid oxygen.

01:09:59.669 --> 01:10:02.103
Don, what's the temperature here?

01:10:06.275 --> 01:10:07.572
Minus 10.

01:10:07.777 --> 01:10:11.380
I thought so. There's a reason
for that thing to be down here.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:14.313
It's using the volcanic heat
of the planet.

01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:18.187
The liquid oxygen will freeze
the brain substance, make it hard as rock.

01:10:18.287 --> 01:10:20.346
Our guns will finish him.

01:11:01.697 --> 01:11:03.733
Explorer 12.

01:11:03.833 --> 01:11:06.028
Come in, Svend, this is Eric.

01:11:06.535 --> 01:11:08.237
Svend here. Yes, Commander?

01:11:08.337 --> 01:11:12.942
Prepare for emergency takeoff. Repeat.
Prepare for emergency takeoff.

01:11:13.042 --> 01:11:14.304
Yes, sir.

01:11:41.871 --> 01:11:44.066
Up there, quick. Ingrid.

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.774
I had to see you again.

01:11:47.176 --> 01:11:49.845
- I must leave this place.
- Don't leave me here.

01:11:49.945 --> 01:11:52.140
All right, Ingrid, we'll try.

01:11:53.049 --> 01:11:54.812
Don, give me a hand.

01:11:55.918 --> 01:11:59.684
- We can't, Eric.
- Do as I say. We're taking her aboard.

01:12:09.065 --> 01:12:10.132
- Karl?
- He's dead.

01:12:10.232 --> 01:12:12.132
Let's get out of here.

01:12:31.587 --> 01:12:32.952
Rockets on.

01:12:52.775 --> 01:12:54.210
We made it.

01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:56.608
Now let's check. Don?

01:13:09.892 --> 01:13:13.020
- All readings check, sir.
- Svend, the motors?

01:13:15.197 --> 01:13:17.461
Everything in perfect order.

01:13:17.933 --> 01:13:19.264
Thank God.
