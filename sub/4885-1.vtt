03:36.608 --> 03:39.528
There's never a cop around
when you need one.

04:58.106 --> 04:59.358
How much?

05:02.694 --> 05:04.947
Can't say I'm crazy about the paint job.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.455
How long to get an order from the factory?

05:41.733 --> 05:44.570
How much you give me
in trade for my Ford?

05:46.363 --> 05:50.033
Really? Thanks a lot, you cheating bastard.

06:10.554 --> 06:13.891
Great show. Held over
for a third straight year.

06:44.254 --> 06:45.839
<i>Marijuana!</i>

06:45.923 --> 06:49.009
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome warmly...</i>

06:49.092 --> 06:51.094
<i>Country Joe and the Fish.</i>

07:04.900 --> 07:07.277
<i>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

07:07.945 --> 07:10.823
<i>We're certainly delighted to be here today.</i>

07:11.281 --> 07:13.909
<i>We'd like to start off
our portion of the show...</i>

07:13.992 --> 07:18.121
<i>by giving you a taste of a little something
we call rock and soul music.</i>

07:28.340 --> 07:33.262
<i>This is really beautiful, man.
You have to realize the turnabout...</i>

07:33.345 --> 07:36.598
<i>that I've gone through
in the last three days.</i>

07:36.682 --> 07:40.644
<i>Just to look, just to see,
just to really realize...</i>

07:40.727 --> 07:42.479
<i>what's really important.</i>

07:42.563 --> 07:46.733
<i>The fact that if we can't
all live together and be happy...</i>

07:46.817 --> 07:49.444
<i>if you have to be afraid
to walk out in the street...</i>

07:49.528 --> 07:53.532
<i>if you have to be afraid
to smile at somebody, right?</i>

07:53.615 --> 07:56.869
<i>What kind of a way is that
to go through this life?</i>

08:02.166 --> 08:04.960
They sure don't make pictures
like that anymore.

08:53.926 --> 08:56.803
There is no phone ringing, damn it!

08:59.681 --> 09:01.350
There is no phone.

09:04.728 --> 09:06.980
My God, it's almost dark.

09:08.732 --> 09:10.734
They'll be waking up soon.

12:08.829 --> 12:12.624
<i>Penthouse, Robert, and hurry. Oui, oui, sir.</i>

12:36.356 --> 12:39.610
<i>This is your commentator
Jonathan Matthias with another bulletin.</i>

12:39.693 --> 12:43.614
<i>And now, as the Sino-Russian border war
continues to rapidly escalate...</i>

12:43.864 --> 12:47.993
U.S. Authorities are beginning to question
to what degree we will become involved...

12:48.076 --> 12:51.163
in what could
swiftly grow into global conflict.

12:57.085 --> 13:01.924
<i>Abort firings! Interception
will fragment the cilia-carrying missiles.</i>

13:02.007 --> 13:04.885
<i>Repeat! Abort firings!</i>

13:05.052 --> 13:08.555
<i>Interception will fragment
the cilia-carrying missiles.</i>

13:28.659 --> 13:29.701
Hi.

13:30.828 --> 13:32.996
Another day, another dollar.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.852
Hi, big brother. How's your ass?

13:55.811 --> 13:57.980
As for you, I think it's your move.

14:03.193 --> 14:04.444
Join me?

14:10.284 --> 14:11.702
Miserable schmuck.

14:14.371 --> 14:17.875
<i>Isn't he? Isn't he a sullen...</i>

14:45.277 --> 14:46.904
At it again, I see.

14:47.821 --> 14:52.326
What'll it be tonight?
Museum of science? Some library?

14:53.035 --> 14:54.995
Poor miserable bastards.

14:57.039 --> 14:59.875
They almost got me tonight,
you know that?

15:04.838 --> 15:08.008
Neville, come out!

15:08.091 --> 15:09.343
Shut up!

15:12.930 --> 15:16.099
- Neville!
- Why the hell can't you leave me alone?

15:29.780 --> 15:31.824
Three, brother? Are you sure?

15:32.282 --> 15:35.911
- Not three.
- Three, brother.

15:37.037 --> 15:40.457
Two were inside the garage
when he brought down the door.

15:40.749 --> 15:43.502
We heard the shooting. Then Joshua.

15:43.585 --> 15:46.672
The light. They should have
stayed clear of the light.

15:46.755 --> 15:50.300
There was no light, brother. Just the fire.

15:50.384 --> 15:54.680
- Nonsense. Neville can't see in the dark.
- Tell him that.

15:54.763 --> 15:58.517
- Any more than we can see in the light.
- To hell he sees.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.727
Good enough, he sees.

16:01.478 --> 16:04.648
More! Burn it all!

16:04.982 --> 16:06.316
One creature...

16:08.902 --> 16:11.613
caught in a place
he cannot stir from in the dark.

16:11.697 --> 16:14.658
Alone. Outnumbered, hundreds to one.

16:14.908 --> 16:16.910
Nothing to live for but his memories.

16:16.994 --> 16:21.790
Nothing to live with but his gadgets,
his cars, his guns, gimmicks.

16:23.375 --> 16:27.004
<i>And yet the whole Family
can't bring him down out of that...</i>

16:27.087 --> 16:30.132
That honky paradise, brother?

16:31.216 --> 16:35.387
Forget the old ways, brother.
All your hatreds, all your pains.

16:35.554 --> 16:38.348
Forget. And remember...

16:39.016 --> 16:41.059
the Family is one.

16:42.478 --> 16:44.897
But him, that thing...

16:45.981 --> 16:48.192
that creature of the wheel...

16:48.442 --> 16:51.528
<i>that lord of the infernal engines
and machines...</i>

16:57.951 --> 17:00.204
What day is it, anyway? Monday?

17:02.122 --> 17:04.290
The hell it is. It's Sunday!

17:05.501 --> 17:07.920
Sunday, I always dress for dinner.

17:09.213 --> 17:12.215
Let me put the power to him, brother.
Just a little nitro.

17:12.299 --> 17:15.051
I can get the cannons
out of the old guard armory.

17:15.260 --> 17:17.887
- We could have him out in no time.
- I said no.

17:18.513 --> 17:22.059
We could, but then
the curse would begin all over again.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.560
- Don't you see?
- Yes, I see.

17:25.186 --> 17:27.689
I see him living high in the light...

17:27.772 --> 17:31.527
while we rot and hide like grubs.

17:31.610 --> 17:35.072
- What do you see, brother?
- He will be destroyed, brother. He will.

17:35.239 --> 17:39.493
But not by guns, not by machines,
not by the evil forbidden things...

17:40.077 --> 17:42.412
the tools that destroyed the world.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.706
The world.

17:45.707 --> 17:47.918
<i>They destroyed the world.</i>

17:48.001 --> 17:50.254
<i>The entire Los Angeles area.</i>

17:50.337 --> 17:53.590
<i>Already hospital facilities have begun
to crack under the strain...</i>

17:53.674 --> 17:58.178
<i>and civil defense authorities state the
situation is the same across the country.</i>

17:58.262 --> 18:00.931
Marshal law is now nationwide.

18:01.056 --> 18:04.726
<i>Major cities in all parts of the country:
New York, Los Angeles...</i>

18:04.810 --> 18:09.273
<i>report plague victims falling dead
in the streets, in their homes, at work.</i>

18:09.481 --> 18:11.942
<i>The first symptom appears to be
severe choking...</i>

18:12.025 --> 18:16.029
<i>followed by immediate unconsciousness.
Death occurs within minutes.</i>

18:16.196 --> 18:19.408
Whether a state of war
between China and Russia still exists...

18:19.491 --> 18:21.326
is not important any longer.

18:21.410 --> 18:23.287
<i>Our fellow countrymen are dying.</i>

18:23.370 --> 18:26.498
<i>The very foundations of civilization
are beginning to crumble...</i>

18:26.582 --> 18:30.460
<i>under the dread assault of
that horror long feared: Germ warfare.</i>

18:30.544 --> 18:33.463
<i>CONELRAD Channel.
This is a class-one emergency.</i>

18:33.547 --> 18:36.341
<i>All civilian traffic is barred
from streets and highways.</i>

18:36.425 --> 18:38.677
<i>Stay in your homes.</i>

18:38.844 --> 18:43.015
<i>Those found without specific military
orders are subject to summary execution.</i>

18:43.098 --> 18:45.809
<i>Stay in your homes.
Repeat. CONELRAD Channel.</i>

18:45.893 --> 18:47.644
<i>This is a class-one emergency.</i>

18:47.728 --> 18:50.647
<i>All civilian traffic is barred
from streets and highways.</i>

18:58.572 --> 19:02.659
<i>Now the question is survival.
Is this the end of technological man?</i>

19:03.827 --> 19:08.540
<i>Is this the conclusion of all our yesterdays,
the boasts of our fabled science...</i>

19:08.624 --> 19:13.003
<i>the superhuman conquests
of space and time, the age of the wheel?</i>

19:13.504 --> 19:15.672
<i>We were warned of judgment.</i>

19:17.508 --> 19:20.803
<i>Here it is. Here. Now.</i>

19:21.470 --> 19:24.264
<i>In the form of
billions of microscopic bacilli.</i>

19:24.348 --> 19:25.808
<i>This is the end.</i>

19:28.852 --> 19:30.103
Neville.

19:33.732 --> 19:34.942
I see.

19:35.692 --> 19:37.778
Let's try the test vaccine.

19:38.153 --> 19:41.365
93B-71.

19:42.115 --> 19:44.034
How the hell do I know?

19:45.494 --> 19:46.954
We'll find out.

19:47.496 --> 19:50.082
All right, I'll be there in an hour.

21:27.429 --> 21:28.722
Vaccine.

21:47.533 --> 21:51.954
<i>With fire, my brothers, we have purified
all that lives with our zeal...</i>

21:52.037 --> 21:54.540
<i>and we shall continue with our work.</i>

21:54.623 --> 21:58.669
<i>With our devotion,
we shall cleanse the world.</i>

21:59.586 --> 22:03.298
And Neville will come down,
down to the Family into judgment...

22:03.382 --> 22:05.801
down to punishment for his blasphemies.

22:08.345 --> 22:11.056
Here is the instrument of cleansing,
my brethren.

22:11.140 --> 22:14.268
And nothing quite cleanses like fire.

22:28.907 --> 22:30.742
I was lucky today.

22:33.662 --> 22:35.998
Believe me, I was lucky.

22:39.126 --> 22:40.919
He tried a gambit...

22:41.003 --> 22:44.006
and it almost worked.

22:45.674 --> 22:48.969
But it ended up a stalemate...

22:50.512 --> 22:52.931
with the Family down three pawns.

22:58.103 --> 23:00.856
What do you think his next move will be?

23:04.193 --> 23:07.946
End games are always
full of surprises, aren't they?

23:13.160 --> 23:14.411
My move.

23:23.545 --> 23:25.214
Discovered check.

23:26.298 --> 23:28.634
How does that grab you, Caesar?

23:30.260 --> 23:32.095
Your move, lmperator.

24:11.093 --> 24:12.427
Excuse me.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.022
Did you move?

25:11.904 --> 25:13.071
Balls.

25:20.329 --> 25:23.582
You used to be a nice guy once,
you know that?

26:14.925 --> 26:17.678
And Speedy Bob Neville,
his great legs churning...

26:17.761 --> 26:20.013
goes flashing across the finish line...

26:20.097 --> 26:23.559
with a 3-minute-and-50-second mile.

26:24.351 --> 26:27.396
Go ahead. I wanna see
some son of a bitch beat that.

26:31.567 --> 26:36.363
This is recording 6306,
Rimini Boulevard, Sector 2.

26:37.364 --> 26:39.992
Last five blocks have been clear...

26:40.075 --> 26:42.786
except for some signs
they've been foraging for food...

26:42.870 --> 26:45.539
in a small grocery store...

26:48.417 --> 26:50.627
at 5500 block.

26:52.129 --> 26:55.883
You'd think the prices
would keep them in the supermarkets.

26:56.884 --> 27:00.429
You gotta hand it to them.
They sure cover their tracks.

27:00.512 --> 27:01.805
Two years.

27:04.558 --> 27:08.812
If I could just find the nest,
find out where they hole up.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.069
Matthias!

30:44.611 --> 30:48.031
All right, where's Matthias?

30:53.912 --> 30:58.250
Come on. Where's Matthias?
Where's the hive?

31:06.008 --> 31:10.429
Journal recording 958. August 5, 1977.

31:11.263 --> 31:14.975
I found another one,
one of Matthias' group, dead of plague.

31:15.809 --> 31:17.603
The sweep continues.

31:58.936 --> 32:00.437
Not my color.

33:50.506 --> 33:52.674
Wait! Come back!

33:55.511 --> 33:57.221
I want to talk to you!

35:06.957 --> 35:08.834
Is this how it starts?

35:11.211 --> 35:13.630
A trip to the laughing academy?

35:16.758 --> 35:18.218
No, you silly bastard.

35:18.302 --> 35:21.597
It starts with you
asking yourself idiot questions.

35:24.141 --> 35:25.309
Right.

35:28.145 --> 35:29.271
Okay.

35:31.190 --> 35:32.983
Let's get cleaned up...

35:35.819 --> 35:38.530
and find a drink before the bars close.

37:47.242 --> 37:50.913
And, oh, brothers and sisters,
I ask you to look at him.

37:51.163 --> 37:53.874
Does he have the marks?
Do you see them?

37:55.709 --> 37:58.587
You see him, as we were
before the punishment...

37:58.670 --> 38:00.589
before we gained grace.

38:01.673 --> 38:06.011
You see lying there the last of scientists,
of bankers, of businessmen...

38:06.386 --> 38:08.055
the users of the wheel.

38:09.556 --> 38:12.309
Do we use the tools
of the wheel as he does?

38:14.645 --> 38:16.647
- Is he of the Family?
- No.

38:17.815 --> 38:19.983
Is he of the sacred society?

38:20.567 --> 38:23.570
- Then what is he?
- Evil.

38:24.863 --> 38:26.824
He is part of the dead.

38:28.033 --> 38:29.660
He has no place here.

38:30.160 --> 38:33.747
He has the stink of oil
and electrical circuitry about him.

38:33.872 --> 38:35.457
He is obsolete.

38:36.834 --> 38:38.544
You are discarded.

38:38.961 --> 38:41.296
You are the refuse of the past.

38:42.923 --> 38:44.716
You're full of crap.

38:47.886 --> 38:50.180
How hard it is to admit the truth.

38:50.597 --> 38:54.143
Take him to the little room
for the questioning.

39:02.609 --> 39:06.071
Mr. Neville, now we can talk a little while.

39:06.864 --> 39:10.367
It's been a long time since you've talked,
except to yourself.

39:11.660 --> 39:13.871
Tell me something, would you?

39:14.288 --> 39:17.749
Are you fellas
really with the Internal Revenue Service?

39:19.168 --> 39:22.379
Your little jokes
are meaningless, Mr. Neville.

39:22.921 --> 39:26.550
Or doctor, or colonel,
or whatever it was they called you.

39:26.633 --> 39:30.721
- I'm a scientist. What the hell are you?
- Definition of a scientist:

39:30.804 --> 39:34.725
A man who understood nothing,
until there was nothing left to understand.

39:39.021 --> 39:43.108
So there is a little light
in the forest after all.

39:43.192 --> 39:45.402
A guiding light, Mr. Neville.

39:46.028 --> 39:48.655
Now to me has passed the responsibility...

39:48.739 --> 39:51.575
for this last tiny remnant of mankind.

39:52.242 --> 39:54.870
Then why don't you quit
these bloody games?

39:55.412 --> 40:00.042
Throw away those Halloween costumes,
and get these people organized, damn it.

40:00.793 --> 40:03.128
Or are you already too far gone?

40:03.212 --> 40:05.714
- A long road of truth...
- For God's sake.

40:05.798 --> 40:08.300
And we are very organized, Mr. Neville.

40:08.383 --> 40:10.719
After last night, you should know that.

40:12.054 --> 40:15.432
If you're organized,
why don't you try finding a cure?

40:15.516 --> 40:17.059
There is none!

40:22.272 --> 40:25.108
There was no cure, and there is no cure...

40:26.235 --> 40:28.612
but the Family has found its way.

40:28.946 --> 40:30.531
We can bear it.

40:31.031 --> 40:33.700
The only burden left is you.

40:34.618 --> 40:37.246
But you've been trying to kill me
for two years.

40:37.329 --> 40:39.623
Last night you killed how many?

40:39.915 --> 40:42.960
Three of us?
And today, we don't know yet.

40:44.253 --> 40:47.131
You're the angel of death, Doctor, not us.

41:10.070 --> 41:12.406
He has confessed all, brothers.

41:12.823 --> 41:16.994
Murder, use of forbidden tools,
practice of prescribed rites.

41:17.703 --> 41:22.082
He admits science, medicine, weapons,
machinery, electricity.

41:22.916 --> 41:25.377
He has not shared the punishments.

41:26.170 --> 41:28.297
He does not bear the marks.

41:28.881 --> 41:29.923
Marks?

41:30.466 --> 41:32.342
Show him, my children.

41:32.885 --> 41:34.845
Show him the pretty marks.

41:45.063 --> 41:47.483
These are the marks, Mr. Neville.

41:47.774 --> 41:51.653
The punishment which you
and those like you brought upon us.

41:51.862 --> 41:55.991
In the beginning we tried to help
one another, those that were left.

41:56.283 --> 41:59.161
We tried to clean things up,
set things straight.

41:59.578 --> 42:01.747
We buried things and burned.

42:01.997 --> 42:04.792
<i>Then it came to me
that we were chosen...</i>

42:05.542 --> 42:07.586
Chosen for just this work.

42:07.878 --> 42:10.964
To bury what was dead,
to burn what was evil...

42:11.256 --> 42:13.383
to destroy what was dangerous.

42:15.135 --> 42:16.845
You're barbarians.

42:17.638 --> 42:19.014
Barbarians?

42:19.848 --> 42:21.725
You call us barbarian?

42:25.062 --> 42:27.147
This is an honorable name.

42:27.689 --> 42:31.109
We mean to cancel the world
you civilized people made.

42:31.193 --> 42:33.195
We will erase history from the time...

42:33.278 --> 42:36.657
that machinery and weapons
threatened more than they offered.

42:36.949 --> 42:38.700
And when you die...

42:38.784 --> 42:41.829
the last living reminder of hell
will be gone.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.164
Gone.

42:48.168 --> 42:49.795
Brother Zachary.

42:51.755 --> 42:53.215
We are ready, brother.

44:25.307 --> 44:27.935
- Here is evil.
- Evil.

44:31.814 --> 44:35.234
Is this not the place
where all the dead were burned?

44:37.194 --> 44:39.988
And this is the last of the dead.

44:40.531 --> 44:42.950
And what shall we do with him,
my brethren?

44:43.033 --> 44:44.326
Burn.

45:01.885 --> 45:04.972
- The dark!
- Turn off the light!

45:07.766 --> 45:09.601
Get those lights out!

45:14.189 --> 45:16.525
Give us the dark!

45:18.485 --> 45:20.946
Bring back the dark!

45:26.618 --> 45:28.412
Who the hell are you?

45:29.204 --> 45:30.455
Shut up.

45:39.715 --> 45:41.884
He's gone!

45:43.427 --> 45:46.054
Find him. That's an order!

45:46.138 --> 45:48.390
- Find him!
- Go, man, go!

45:50.058 --> 45:51.560
Move!

46:00.903 --> 46:05.157
You son of a bitch, just hold tight.
Up against the wall, you mother.

46:06.617 --> 46:09.411
Don't turn. Just stand.
I'll turn you when I want.

46:09.495 --> 46:12.456
On or off, up or around, I'll turn you.
Now cool it!

46:12.539 --> 46:14.291
Now, put your hands out.

46:14.374 --> 46:17.586
Way out about shoulder high,
like they're gonna crucify you, baby.

46:17.669 --> 46:20.672
Matter of fact, they were gonna roast me.
Why'd you stop 'em?

46:20.756 --> 46:23.383
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

46:23.675 --> 46:26.637
You got any more questions, fathead?

46:27.262 --> 46:28.972
My name is Robert.

46:30.432 --> 46:31.934
Your name's mud.

46:32.017 --> 46:33.644
Down the tunnel!

46:38.273 --> 46:39.608
After him!

46:50.744 --> 46:51.870
Back!

46:55.290 --> 46:57.751
Okay, hold it. Open it up.

47:00.838 --> 47:03.465
- You. You're the...
- Your living Playtex doll.

47:03.549 --> 47:06.343
Now, come on, man. Get the bike.
Move! Pull it out!

47:07.469 --> 47:10.097
- You really plan ahead.
- It helps.

47:10.472 --> 47:14.852
Now look, you gotta run this thing,
you understand, but I'm the ramrod.

47:15.310 --> 47:17.980
Those stadium lights,
how'd you manage that?

47:18.063 --> 47:20.899
- Dutch knows all about that stuff.
- Dutch?

47:20.983 --> 47:23.277
Come on, man. Get on the bike.

47:29.158 --> 47:33.495
Don't screw up. I know how to roll,
but it's hard on the elbows.

47:34.163 --> 47:36.999
And if you just have to play James Bond...

47:37.499 --> 47:39.209
I'll bust your ass.

47:39.626 --> 47:40.836
Yes, ma'am.

47:49.303 --> 47:51.221
Don't let him get away!

48:05.027 --> 48:07.821
Goddamn it, left, and step on it!

48:24.713 --> 48:26.799
Move! Down the tunnel, man.

49:07.923 --> 49:09.925
Hit it. They're blinded.

49:10.551 --> 49:13.011
Okay, baby. Hitch up your drawers.

49:51.633 --> 49:54.678
- I thought we'd gotten past that.
- You're sweet.

49:54.761 --> 49:56.472
It's okay, Tommy.

49:56.555 --> 49:58.974
This is the man, and I mean the man.

49:59.057 --> 50:01.018
But he's cool. It's okay.

50:02.811 --> 50:04.271
Come on, man.

50:46.730 --> 50:49.066
This is it. That's all there is.

50:50.192 --> 50:52.152
At least all we know of.

50:52.736 --> 50:57.574
There are others, I guess, if Matthias
and his brethren haven't killed them all.

50:58.408 --> 51:00.869
I didn't know there were any left.

51:11.505 --> 51:13.924
Between the Family at night
and you in the daytime...

51:14.007 --> 51:17.344
shooting at anything that moved,
man, we had to stay low.

51:17.719 --> 51:19.513
I had to stay alive.

51:36.989 --> 51:38.949
The mad bomber himself.

51:39.199 --> 51:41.535
And I see you got the mad scientist.

51:42.369 --> 51:44.663
- You know me?
- And about your work.

51:44.746 --> 51:45.956
My work?

51:49.209 --> 51:52.379
Biowar pathology perimeters
in urban and semi-urban environments.

51:52.463 --> 51:55.215
<i>Journal of Military Medicine, June, 1974.</i>

51:55.299 --> 51:59.511
Incremental effects, countermeasures to
toxic agents, and liquid systems delivery.

51:59.595 --> 52:02.973
<i>Microbiological Letters,
January, 1975. Remember?</i>

52:04.308 --> 52:07.186
That's a nice recitation.
You know what it means?

52:07.269 --> 52:10.272
I was a med school senior
when they scratched the world.

52:10.355 --> 52:14.610
As a matter of fact, I was gonna apply
to Biowar Labs for my post-doc...

52:14.818 --> 52:18.280
- but the next term never came.
- Sorry you didn't make it.

52:18.489 --> 52:20.407
Sorry the world didn't make it.

52:20.491 --> 52:22.659
Come on. Let's go see about Richie.

52:23.327 --> 52:26.622
Lisa's brother. He looks like
he's about to go over.

52:28.874 --> 52:32.169
You've only seen the tertiary cases,
Matthias and his people.

52:32.252 --> 52:35.297
We're not that far gone,
but we're on the road.

52:35.839 --> 52:39.092
The yellow brick road.
We're off to see the wizard.

52:39.176 --> 52:43.180
When it hit, the older people either died
or went to the third stage fast...

52:43.263 --> 52:45.933
you know, blindness in light, albinism...

52:46.016 --> 52:50.729
psychotic illusions, occasional stages of
torpor, like Matthias and the things there.

52:51.480 --> 52:54.900
- What about you? Why didn't you get it?
- I don't know.

52:55.442 --> 52:58.362
Some of the younger people
have a kind of...

52:59.446 --> 53:00.656
resistance.

53:00.864 --> 53:03.742
I don't know, we just hold out.

53:05.536 --> 53:09.123
Some of us are a bit light-sensitive,
otherwise, we're all right.

53:09.206 --> 53:11.208
But Richie's definitely going.

53:11.291 --> 53:14.002
He's advanced secondary. Incidentally...

53:14.461 --> 53:17.297
mind telling me
what keeps you in the city?

53:17.506 --> 53:19.925
You some kind of exterminator?

53:21.009 --> 53:23.220
I guess maybe you could call it that.

53:23.804 --> 53:25.722
Very complicated, Doctor.

53:25.806 --> 53:29.560
I'd be living on top of City Hall,
or better, the Oxy Tower...

53:29.643 --> 53:31.687
instead of that pillbox you're in.

53:31.770 --> 53:34.648
That's where I live.
It's where I used to live.

53:34.731 --> 53:38.235
It's where I'm going to live,
and not Matthias nor his Family...

53:38.318 --> 53:41.363
nor any other son of a bitch
is going to make me leave.

53:44.491 --> 53:46.034
He's no better.

53:46.618 --> 53:48.287
His fever is high.

54:06.346 --> 54:08.182
- What are you...
- Shut up.

54:08.265 --> 54:10.017
Keep out of the way.

54:11.768 --> 54:13.020
Sit down.

54:24.531 --> 54:27.826
Could stay this way for weeks,
or he'll go over 10 minutes from now.

54:27.910 --> 54:29.870
I've seen them go before.

54:30.954 --> 54:33.582
I almost got killed by a friend
of mine last summer.

54:33.665 --> 54:36.043
He went over without any warning.

54:36.335 --> 54:38.128
When I looked away...

54:38.879 --> 54:42.758
his face was pale and his hair was going.
When I looked back...

54:43.759 --> 54:45.719
he didn't have any eyes.

54:46.804 --> 54:48.388
What did you do?

54:49.056 --> 54:52.100
I did just like you'd do, Doctor. I killed him.

54:52.309 --> 54:54.728
If the Masonic rites are over.

54:55.771 --> 54:57.397
How about Richie?

55:10.369 --> 55:13.914
We'll take him to my place.
I got nearly everything I need there.

55:14.373 --> 55:16.917
Is there anything you can do, Doctor?

55:17.000 --> 55:20.546
I mean, seeing how you've lost
over 200 million patients.

55:22.172 --> 55:23.757
I don't have it.

55:24.174 --> 55:25.509
Have what?

55:25.592 --> 55:27.553
The plague. I'm immune.

55:29.638 --> 55:32.724
- Everybody has it.
- Everybody but me.

55:33.267 --> 55:36.228
There was a vaccine,
just an experimental batch.

55:36.311 --> 55:38.522
We weren't sure it would work.

55:42.943 --> 55:46.113
- Why, if you're immune, you could...
- That's right.

55:46.488 --> 55:48.282
My blood might be a serum.

55:48.365 --> 55:52.828
At the stage that boy's in, my antibodies
could reverse the whole process. Stop it.

55:53.495 --> 55:55.581
Christ, you could save the world.

55:55.664 --> 55:57.666
Screw the world. Let's save Richie.

56:02.880 --> 56:05.757
Nothing with drugs.
It's got to be the serum.

56:05.841 --> 56:08.427
Couldn't you reconstitute the vaccine?

56:08.510 --> 56:10.637
You got any idea
how many steps it takes...

56:10.721 --> 56:13.932
to synthesize an antibiotic
specific for this bug?

56:14.766 --> 56:18.312
- Got the picture.
- I've tried. God knows I've tried.

56:18.395 --> 56:21.190
Once I caught one
of Matthias' people last year...

56:21.482 --> 56:23.942
<i>and tried everything
on the shelves on him.</i>

56:38.373 --> 56:39.917
<i>He damn near killed me...</i>

56:40.000 --> 56:42.377
<i>and then he died very badly himself.</i>

56:43.170 --> 56:45.255
So it's very tight, Doctor.

56:45.881 --> 56:47.257
Very tight.

57:09.071 --> 57:10.739
Bring him in here.

57:14.159 --> 57:15.536
In the bed.

57:18.872 --> 57:21.375
I see where you do your heavy thinking.

57:21.458 --> 57:24.002
One side keeps the other side going.

57:24.211 --> 57:26.630
Can't have one without the other.

57:35.389 --> 57:37.724
- I'm a narcissist.
- How do you do?

57:41.478 --> 57:44.356
- The guest room.
- You weren't expecting us?

57:46.400 --> 57:48.318
I wasn't expecting you.

57:51.280 --> 57:52.656
Hold these.

57:56.785 --> 57:58.787
I'm gonna need some help.

57:59.246 --> 58:01.081
Lisa will have to do.

58:01.790 --> 58:04.751
I hate to leave the kids alone too long.
They get spooked.

58:04.835 --> 58:06.420
Watch your mouth.

58:16.680 --> 58:19.183
Some of the kids,
you know what they say?

58:19.266 --> 58:21.435
What do some of the kids say?

58:21.643 --> 58:24.897
They say the Family comes
in the night when it's dark.

58:24.980 --> 58:28.150
They say they're going to come
some night and take Richie's soul...

58:28.233 --> 58:31.069
and tie it all up in a bag
and give it to the devil.

58:31.153 --> 58:34.781
Is that really true?
Do you know if that's really true?

58:35.115 --> 58:37.284
We wouldn't let that happen.

58:38.327 --> 58:39.661
Not a chance.

58:41.955 --> 58:43.373
Are you God?

58:48.378 --> 58:52.257
Let's find out if he's a doctor first
before we go promoting him, okay?

58:52.341 --> 58:53.383
Okay.

01:00:09.209 --> 01:00:10.878
How about a break?

01:00:44.036 --> 01:00:45.370
Your move.

01:00:46.997 --> 01:00:48.749
I just made my move.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.605
Where'd you get that dress?

01:01:12.022 --> 01:01:15.275
The same place you got that jacket.
I hustled it.

01:01:16.777 --> 01:01:19.321
The house fuzz was on vacation.

01:01:20.489 --> 01:01:23.242
Neville.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.380
<i>His voice...</i>

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.967
I'll never get used to it...

01:01:40.259 --> 01:01:41.760
to hearing it.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.140
<i>Something...</i>

01:01:48.725 --> 01:01:51.186
We were with them for a while, you know?

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:52.771
With Matthias?

01:01:53.856 --> 01:01:56.150
You were a part of that Family?

01:01:56.817 --> 01:02:00.028
When it happened,
when even the army fell apart...

01:02:00.362 --> 01:02:04.366
and there was nobody left
except those living alone like animals...

01:02:05.075 --> 01:02:08.495
Matthias walked the streets at night...

01:02:08.996 --> 01:02:10.831
ringing a bell.

01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:17.629
Richie and I, we had us a place
in the back of a furniture store.

01:02:18.297 --> 01:02:20.883
One day, we hear this bell.

01:02:21.341 --> 01:02:24.595
So we go out to see,
and there are people there.

01:02:25.262 --> 01:02:27.055
We thought we were alone...

01:02:27.139 --> 01:02:30.058
just me and Richie
with millions of corpses.

01:02:30.684 --> 01:02:33.437
But there was Matthias and other people.

01:02:35.355 --> 01:02:39.776
Anyway, he gave us the Family for a while.

01:02:41.069 --> 01:02:42.821
We helped with the burials.

01:02:42.905 --> 01:02:44.907
We helped with the burnings.

01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:48.035
But when it was over,
and the worst was past...

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.748
they began to know
how different we were, our skin, our eyes.

01:02:53.499 --> 01:02:57.211
One day while they were asleep,
we just took off.

01:03:01.215 --> 01:03:04.384
How'd you get mixed up
with Dutch and his group?

01:03:07.387 --> 01:03:10.974
Dutch came by one day
and said he was with the census bureau.

01:03:22.194 --> 01:03:24.112
Now, what are you thinking?

01:03:28.283 --> 01:03:30.661
You know the old song?

01:03:31.954 --> 01:03:35.874
"If you were the only girl in the world
and I were the only boy"? Okay...

01:03:35.958 --> 01:03:38.293
but until then don't bother me.

01:03:40.629 --> 01:03:42.631
I guess I'm the only boy.

01:03:54.852 --> 01:03:56.228
The Family.

01:03:57.396 --> 01:04:00.274
I forgot to keep the fuel up
in the generator.

01:04:00.357 --> 01:04:02.442
They'll be into the garage!

01:04:10.576 --> 01:04:12.077
You stay here.

01:04:13.704 --> 01:04:15.747
- What's this for?
- Comfort.

01:05:00.793 --> 01:05:02.628
You may not have time.

01:05:02.795 --> 01:05:05.297
More time than Neville has, brother.

01:05:05.422 --> 01:05:08.217
- When he comes back, I'll be waiting...
- Take care.

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.844
- He has the luck of a devil.
- I know.

01:05:10.928 --> 01:05:13.472
But this time his luck has run out.

01:08:40.845 --> 01:08:43.348
You can take down
that service flag now, mother.

01:08:43.432 --> 01:08:45.684
Man, don't scare me like that.

01:08:54.776 --> 01:08:56.028
You all right?

01:08:56.904 --> 01:08:58.447
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:09:04.328 --> 01:09:08.040
What's this stuff about me being
the only girl in the world?

01:09:29.185 --> 01:09:31.354
Do you know it's been a long time?

01:09:31.438 --> 01:09:34.024
I'm not sure I remember how this goes.

01:09:52.917 --> 01:09:55.712
- How is he?
- He's stable.

01:09:56.463 --> 01:10:00.843
No loss of pigment since yesterday
and vital signs are steady.

01:10:02.886 --> 01:10:04.513
He's comfortable.

01:10:09.434 --> 01:10:10.769
I'm sorry.

01:10:11.186 --> 01:10:13.856
It's been a long time
since I've had a patient.

01:10:13.939 --> 01:10:17.401
Doctor, you certainly haven't lost
your bedside manner.

01:10:18.735 --> 01:10:20.070
Is that so?

01:10:41.341 --> 01:10:43.260
Are you ready for this?

01:10:43.635 --> 01:10:45.012
What is it?

01:10:45.846 --> 01:10:47.598
Birth control pills.

01:12:18.564 --> 01:12:19.690
Yeah.

01:12:20.357 --> 01:12:21.775
Here we are.

01:12:22.943 --> 01:12:25.529
I can make toxins from both of these.

01:12:43.797 --> 01:12:46.049
All right, now the tourniquet.

01:12:48.844 --> 01:12:50.387
Good and tight.

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.518
That's fine.

01:12:57.227 --> 01:12:58.854
Give me the swab.

01:13:03.859 --> 01:13:06.069
All right, you get the needle.

01:13:12.409 --> 01:13:13.702
Go ahead.

01:13:20.417 --> 01:13:22.920
All right, take off the tourniquet.

01:13:31.929 --> 01:13:33.764
Will one bottle be enough?

01:13:33.847 --> 01:13:36.767
It's genuine 160-proof
old Anglo-Saxon, baby.

01:13:41.688 --> 01:13:44.608
I was a very peculiar doctor
in those days...

01:13:45.108 --> 01:13:48.487
trying to find treatments
for diseases that hadn't existed...

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:50.948
till other doctors invented them.

01:13:51.198 --> 01:13:53.534
Now I'm the only game in town.

01:13:56.912 --> 01:14:00.791
I don't know how much.
I'll draw blood as often as I can.

01:14:00.874 --> 01:14:03.710
We'll just have to keep
pumping it into him.

01:14:03.794 --> 01:14:06.964
- How long do you think it'll take?
- I don't know.

01:14:07.673 --> 01:14:09.466
I really don't know.

01:14:09.925 --> 01:14:11.301
But if it does work...

01:14:11.385 --> 01:14:14.805
then Richie will be the source
of even more antibodies.

01:14:15.222 --> 01:14:17.349
The more people we inject...

01:14:18.142 --> 01:14:20.144
the more serum we'll get.

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.982
<i>And when that's done...</i>

01:14:26.024 --> 01:14:28.819
When that's done, baby, we will pull out.

01:14:29.361 --> 01:14:32.030
We'll take what we need
and head for the mountains.

01:14:33.323 --> 01:14:36.827
Out of "rats' alley
where the dead men lost their bones."

01:14:37.244 --> 01:14:41.748
T.S. Eliot turns out to have been
just as good a prophet as he was a poet.

01:14:46.128 --> 01:14:47.671
<i>The Waste Land.</i>

01:14:48.755 --> 01:14:50.883
I wonder if it comforts him.

01:14:51.258 --> 01:14:54.720
I wonder if I'll ever see
a stream full of fish again.

01:14:55.304 --> 01:14:58.682
Where'd you ever see
a stream full of fish in Harlem?

01:14:59.641 --> 01:15:01.185
At the movies.

01:15:10.861 --> 01:15:13.197
- Does that hurt?
- A little, yeah.

01:15:15.365 --> 01:15:18.494
It hurts. How about off, man? Turn it off.

01:15:20.704 --> 01:15:24.792
A week ago, that much light
would have sent you right up the wall.

01:15:26.877 --> 01:15:29.171
I'm beginning to see the light.

01:15:33.967 --> 01:15:36.720
I'll have another batch of serum ready
in a few hours...

01:15:36.804 --> 01:15:39.932
then we'll load up that Land Rover,
pick up Dutch and the kids...

01:15:40.015 --> 01:15:42.184
and head for the hills.
How about the Sierras?

01:15:42.267 --> 01:15:43.310
Yeah.

01:15:43.685 --> 01:15:46.313
Baby, we made it. We really made it.

01:15:46.396 --> 01:15:49.483
I think I'll go pick up
some stuff for the trip.

01:15:52.236 --> 01:15:54.571
Is there anything special you fancy, baby?

01:15:54.655 --> 01:15:58.617
What I pick up today,
you're going to be seeing for a long time.

01:15:59.076 --> 01:16:01.286
- Why don't you skip it?
- Honey.

01:16:01.411 --> 01:16:05.833
The most dangerous thing I ever ran into
in one of those stores was you.

01:16:05.916 --> 01:16:07.668
You watch yourself.

01:16:07.793 --> 01:16:11.755
You stay on the ground floors,
near the doors, and in the light.

01:16:12.422 --> 01:16:14.925
- If you see anything, shoot.
- Check.

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:19.263
Honey, can I borrow your credit cards?

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:43.370
Is that gonna be for me?

01:16:43.454 --> 01:16:45.414
You don't need any more.

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:48.417
This is for Lisa.

01:16:48.876 --> 01:16:51.795
- One of these days, she may...
- Start to turn?

01:16:52.296 --> 01:16:54.423
That's always a possibility.

01:16:54.798 --> 01:16:57.426
It's best to catch these things early.

01:16:59.386 --> 01:17:02.306
Then you don't think
the serum would work...

01:17:03.015 --> 01:17:04.766
for tertiary cases?

01:17:05.309 --> 01:17:07.728
- What do you mean?
- Like Matthias.

01:17:07.936 --> 01:17:09.313
The Family.

01:17:10.147 --> 01:17:11.815
It's hard to say.

01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:13.901
Would it?

01:17:14.193 --> 01:17:16.320
Come on, help me with this.

01:17:19.573 --> 01:17:22.743
Put the cap on that.
Put it in the refrigerator.

01:17:30.501 --> 01:17:34.505
I can't afford to give more blood
till I get clear of this town.

01:17:36.882 --> 01:17:40.427
Later on, if your blood count comes up...

01:17:40.844 --> 01:17:44.848
and you put on some weight,
we can use your blood to make serum.

01:17:46.266 --> 01:17:47.351
Yeah?

01:17:49.144 --> 01:17:51.271
Yeah. Now, go eat your soup.

01:18:21.552 --> 01:18:24.721
Someone ought to do
something about those people.

01:18:26.932 --> 01:18:28.267
How about it?

01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:30.769
- You gonna give them the serum?
- Fat chance.

01:18:30.853 --> 01:18:32.104
How come?

01:18:32.437 --> 01:18:35.274
We'd have to be here
for a few more months, for one thing.

01:18:35.357 --> 01:18:38.318
For another thing,
they're homicidal maniacs, for God's sake.

01:18:38.402 --> 01:18:41.697
Man, they're humans.
I mean, they're sick, you know?

01:18:42.531 --> 01:18:44.074
They're vermin.

01:18:44.741 --> 01:18:46.118
Okay, then.

01:18:46.743 --> 01:18:48.954
If you don't want to cure them, kill them.

01:18:49.037 --> 01:18:51.081
If I just knew where they're at.

01:18:51.165 --> 01:18:53.750
The old court building, that's where.

01:18:58.005 --> 01:18:59.756
In the Civic Center.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.050
That's where they're holed up.

01:19:02.468 --> 01:19:04.928
- You're kidding me.
- They're there.

01:19:09.475 --> 01:19:12.644
Go on. Ain't you gonna go down there
and zap them?

01:19:13.645 --> 01:19:14.897
Why not?

01:19:15.022 --> 01:19:19.151
You've been looking to kill them
for practically two whole years now.

01:19:19.234 --> 01:19:21.945
Either kill them or cure them, damn it.

01:19:29.077 --> 01:19:30.329
No need.

01:19:33.749 --> 01:19:35.876
They're half-dead right now.

01:19:36.668 --> 01:19:38.545
You know what, mister?

01:19:39.004 --> 01:19:40.589
You're hostile.

01:19:42.007 --> 01:19:43.842
You just don't belong.

01:19:44.301 --> 01:19:46.720
Nice of you to let me hang around.

01:19:48.347 --> 01:19:51.433
At times, you scare me
more than Matthias does.

01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:24.716
- How's Richie?
- Beautiful. It works.

01:20:24.925 --> 01:20:26.552
It works.

01:20:36.812 --> 01:20:39.356
My God, it's a beautiful world!

01:20:39.439 --> 01:20:41.525
Don't you think
we ought to do something?

01:20:41.608 --> 01:20:42.651
Damn right.

01:20:42.734 --> 01:20:44.987
I've got some blood
to make up serum for Lisa.

01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:48.115
We'll start on the rest of you
in a week or so.

01:20:49.408 --> 01:20:51.743
Can you have the kids ready
to leave tomorrow?

01:21:07.759 --> 01:21:10.471
Gonna take me a little ride in the sun.

01:21:12.264 --> 01:21:13.849
Where are we going?

01:21:13.932 --> 01:21:16.768
Away, that's all. Just away.

01:21:17.269 --> 01:21:21.190
Someplace nobody ever bothered with.
A river nobody ever dammed...

01:21:21.273 --> 01:21:23.692
a mountain nobody built
any bloody freeways to...

01:21:23.776 --> 01:21:26.612
where everything we do
will be the first time it happened.

01:21:26.695 --> 01:21:30.574
You got it. That's it. Just like
in the beginning of the world.

01:21:30.783 --> 01:21:34.453
Like we were starting all over again
in the Garden of Eden!

01:21:34.578 --> 01:21:37.748
Only this time,
we don't trust no frigging snake!

01:21:55.015 --> 01:21:57.810
Scout, I wonder if we're gonna have
room for you.

01:22:04.775 --> 01:22:07.486
"Going to find out who's right.

01:22:09.279 --> 01:22:10.656
"You or me."

01:23:46.376 --> 01:23:49.004
- Why are you here?
- I came to help you.

01:23:49.213 --> 01:23:50.756
- You know the man.
- Neville?

01:23:50.839 --> 01:23:52.007
That's him.

01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:54.510
He's got a serum
for what's wrong with you.

01:23:54.593 --> 01:23:57.763
And if you could just talk to him,
get with him...

01:23:57.930 --> 01:24:00.015
<i>then everybody could be...</i>

01:24:00.891 --> 01:24:03.101
Yes? Everybody could be what?

01:24:03.435 --> 01:24:04.686
<i>Everyone...</i>

01:24:05.938 --> 01:24:07.981
Everybody could be normal again.

01:24:08.232 --> 01:24:09.399
I see.

01:24:09.858 --> 01:24:12.986
- We could be as we were before?
- I guess so.

01:24:13.362 --> 01:24:15.614
- The way we were.
- The way we were.

01:24:15.823 --> 01:24:18.659
That's what Neville thinks we want?
Is that why he sent you?

01:24:18.742 --> 01:24:21.120
- He didn't send me. He...
- Silence!

01:24:23.413 --> 01:24:26.250
He sent you to offer us something
from his world...

01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:29.628
to change us back
to the creatures we were. A trick!

01:24:30.504 --> 01:24:33.465
A trick to weaken our resolve.

01:24:33.549 --> 01:24:36.885
I was almost like you, but he saved me.
He brought me back.

01:24:37.052 --> 01:24:39.179
He wants us all to go away from here.

01:24:39.263 --> 01:24:41.473
You have been damned, Richard.

01:24:41.598 --> 01:24:43.809
Don't you see that? Don't you?

01:24:46.311 --> 01:24:48.063
Prepare the Family.

01:24:50.983 --> 01:24:52.317
Tonight...

01:24:53.277 --> 01:24:55.571
I think Neville might come out.

01:25:05.998 --> 01:25:07.666
The Family is one.

01:25:07.958 --> 01:25:09.585
The Family is all.

01:25:12.171 --> 01:25:14.339
We have cleansed the world.

01:25:17.384 --> 01:25:21.013
Outside the Family, there is nothing at all.

01:25:34.443 --> 01:25:35.819
The Family.

01:26:55.149 --> 01:26:58.026
Oh, my God.

01:29:22.796 --> 01:29:24.173
Yes, Robert?

01:29:27.134 --> 01:29:28.719
<i>About Richie...</i>

01:29:29.386 --> 01:29:30.596
I know.

01:29:31.555 --> 01:29:32.806
You know?

01:29:35.309 --> 01:29:36.935
Matthias told me.

01:29:38.145 --> 01:29:39.855
It was necessary.

01:29:40.689 --> 01:29:41.982
My God.

01:29:48.489 --> 01:29:49.656
Come in.

01:29:51.033 --> 01:29:53.118
Sounds strange, doesn't it?

01:29:53.243 --> 01:29:54.870
"Come in, Neville."

01:30:24.191 --> 01:30:27.903
I thought we might arrange
a little entertainment for you...

01:30:28.028 --> 01:30:31.073
before time for concluding
our little business.

01:30:34.243 --> 01:30:35.661
My brothers.

01:31:30.382 --> 01:31:32.509
We waited for you, Neville...

01:31:32.593 --> 01:31:34.928
so you could see this, the end.

01:31:35.929 --> 01:31:39.516
The end of all you've done.
You see, none of it was real.

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.769
It was illusion. Your art, your science.

01:31:42.936 --> 01:31:45.773
It was all a nightmare, and now it's done.

01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:47.441
Finished.

01:31:49.902 --> 01:31:51.278
My brethren...

01:31:52.571 --> 01:31:54.698
our task is nearly complete.

01:31:55.949 --> 01:31:59.244
He was the last of those
who brought the punishment to us.

01:31:59.328 --> 01:32:01.955
We have cleansed and purged his world.

01:32:02.372 --> 01:32:04.041
Now we must build.

01:32:04.958 --> 01:32:07.628
Build coffins. That's all you'll need.

01:32:08.921 --> 01:32:10.255
Bring him.

01:32:18.555 --> 01:32:20.432
All right, stand back!
