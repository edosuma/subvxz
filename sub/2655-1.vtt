01:06.484 --> 01:08.860
Yeah, no, I know. But when you tell me
to do something I'm going to do it.

01:08.861 --> 01:10.863
So I'm emailing him right now.

01:12.531 --> 01:14.074
Well, I don't know how
quick he's going to get back...

01:14.075 --> 01:15.910
because sometimes he doesn't check.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.830
Yeah, and after the poetry reading
I'm not going home.

01:20.039 --> 01:24.460
It's my birthday.
So I want to go to a club.

01:27.379 --> 01:30.841
No, Simon, I'm not going
to lie to her.

01:31.050 --> 01:33.094
I'm just not going to tell her.

01:37.223 --> 01:38.891
Let me go park the truck.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.185
- See you later, alright?
- Okay.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.533
Hi, Dorothea.
How are you?

01:58.828 --> 02:01.080
I'm good.
Thanks for asking.

02:01.330 --> 02:04.499
<i>So I'll just call, I guess,
and get extra tickets.</i>

02:04.500 --> 02:06.251
<i>Yeah, sure, I'll do it right now.</i>

02:06.252 --> 02:08.294
- Hey, you.
- Simon.

02:10.506 --> 02:11.881
Hi, Simon.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.093
He says: "Call me".

02:15.302 --> 02:17.221
She just got home.

02:17.388 --> 02:19.765
I'm sure she can hear you,
she's standing right here.

02:20.599 --> 02:22.142
- Hey, Luke.
- How's it going, Clary?

02:22.143 --> 02:23.768
No, I'll get dressed quick.

02:23.769 --> 02:24.811
Do you want some coffee?

02:24.812 --> 02:26.605
<i>If you keep talking
I'm going to be late.</i>

02:26.897 --> 02:29.150
<i>I'll meet you there, bye.</i>

02:45.624 --> 02:48.127
- Did you just use the...?
- How are you feeling?

02:48.544 --> 02:50.087
Fine. Why?

02:52.173 --> 02:54.716
You make sure you come
straight home tonight.

02:54.717 --> 02:58.137
Mom, come on.
It's just a poetry reading.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.555
I know.

03:05.811 --> 03:07.146
Bye.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.276
You need to talk to her, Jocelyn.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.113
She's not ready.
Not yet.

03:17.114 --> 03:20.159
Yes, she is.
You're not.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.873
By the way, thanks for doing this.
His poetry means a lot to him.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.542
That's what friends are for.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.044
<i>Come...</i>

03:31.128 --> 03:35.465
my faux juggernaut,
my nefarious loins!

03:35.466 --> 03:40.137
Slather every protuberance
with arid zeal.

03:41.972 --> 03:46.852
Agony... Torment.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.941
I can't listen to this.
You want another coffee?

03:49.063 --> 03:50.231
Yeah.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.609
Envelope like tiny crocus petals
whisper death...

03:54.610 --> 03:57.863
- Cappuccino and espresso.
- Rain drowns the earth.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.239
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:59.240 --> 04:04.078
Shivering breezes weave through
a morbid tapestry of festering disease.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.623
Turgid is my torment.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.168
- There we go.
- Thank you.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.923
That blonde girl over there
was totally flirting with you.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.757
Ask her out.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.261
- No, wouldn't be fair.
- Why?

04:20.803 --> 04:25.265
Well, because I'm saving
myself for someone else.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.601
- Who?
- ...is my torment.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.605
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

04:42.116 --> 04:45.118
<i>I think he's getting worse. As his
friend, you should probably tell him.</i>

04:45.119 --> 04:48.205
Maybe his poetry is great.
We just don't know it yet.

04:50.082 --> 04:54.544
Let's go in here. I want to ask
what that symbol means.

04:54.545 --> 04:55.963
Clary, we'll never get in.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.799
Such the eternal optimist.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.845
- This is so not like you.
- Just go with it for once.

05:05.306 --> 05:08.100
Hi. What does that symbol mean?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.689
- What symbol?
- Yeah, what symbol?

05:14.356 --> 05:16.483
It's right there.
You don't see it?

05:16.817 --> 05:17.985
No.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.490
That was cool.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.125
Yeah, we're fitting in.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.586
Go with it.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.673
- Clary, you want a drink?
- Yeah.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.650
<i>Clary.
Clary, what is it?</i>

07:26.071 --> 07:27.281
You didn't see that?

07:32.619 --> 07:35.079
I know what I saw! They killed
the guy that let us in the club.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.998
- Did you drink something?
- God, no, Simon!

07:36.999 --> 07:39.375
I've heard sometimes they pump
hallucinogenic stuff...

07:39.376 --> 07:41.127
into the air vents,
to make sure people have a good time.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.254
Okay, then, how come you're fine?
Do we breathe different air?

07:43.255 --> 07:45.257
I don't know.
Let's just go home.

09:13.845 --> 09:15.639
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.100
You've been sleeping all day.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.269
And you didn't come home
'til late last night.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.771
Yeah. Well, I'm home, okay?

09:25.107 --> 09:26.358
You can't go.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.901
I sold another painting.
I wanted to celebrate with you.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.362
To what, your one buyer?
Who is this guy, anyway?

09:31.363 --> 09:33.114
He probably just buys your stuff
because he's into you.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.475
I'm sure you'll just string him
along like you do with Luke.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.243
You really want to have
that conversation?

09:37.244 --> 09:38.787
What's that supposed to mean?

09:39.454 --> 09:41.497
- Simon.
- He's like my brother.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.375
I doubt he feels that way.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.501
Okay, well, I'm going to go.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.670
- No, no, you can't.
- This is ridiculous.

09:47.671 --> 09:50.549
- Where are you going?
- I'm just going to Java Jones.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.925
- Jesus!
- Nope. Just me.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.678
- Come on, Simon.
- Clary...

09:54.928 --> 09:56.930
there's something I want
to tell you, okay?

09:58.265 --> 10:00.809
- We can talk about this later.
- Bye, Mrs. Fray.

10:09.735 --> 10:10.944
Look.

10:11.069 --> 10:14.230
Suddenly, I'm drawing hundreds of these
things and I have no idea what they are.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.493
I don't know...
I think I'm going out of my mind.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.827
Maybe you're like the guy
in "Close Encounters".

10:19.828 --> 10:23.081
Everybody thought he was paranoid
and then it turned out to be, well...

10:23.707 --> 10:25.916
...UFO... reasonable...

10:25.917 --> 10:27.628
Oh God, this isn't happening.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.423
- What?
- This isn't happening.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.634
Okay, now you're freaking me out.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.555
Clary... are you...?

10:44.728 --> 10:46.229
What are you looking at?

10:46.980 --> 10:47.981
Wait here.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.216
Where's the Cup, Jocie?

11:21.473 --> 11:25.394
- How did you find me?
- You can thank your daughter for that.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.479
Why can I see you
and no one else can?

11:28.480 --> 11:30.357
I was going to ask you
the same question.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.275
I don't even know why I'm talking
to you. You're a killer.

11:33.276 --> 11:36.029
- A cold-blooded killer.
- As opposed to a peace-loving killer?

11:36.279 --> 11:39.241
- I know what I saw.
- You think you know.

11:42.244 --> 11:43.829
Why am I drawing this?

11:46.915 --> 11:48.917
So I was right.
You're not a mundane.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.377
Excuse me.
What's a mundane?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.046
Someone from the human world.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.866
If I'm not a human then what am I?

11:58.009 --> 11:59.511
Go find the Cup.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.760
- When did this start?
- No. No.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.679
Why am I drawing this?

12:43.764 --> 12:45.182
Answer me!

12:52.481 --> 12:53.565
Simon...

13:12.584 --> 13:14.877
Maybe you should answer that.
It could be your boyfriend.

13:14.878 --> 13:17.130
- He's not my boyfriend.
- Does he know that?

13:20.467 --> 13:21.885
Please, it's annoying.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.139
- Mom, I'm coming home.
- No, you can't come home!

13:27.140 --> 13:28.474
You understand me?
You don't come home.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.478
You call Luke. Tell him Valentine's
alive and that he found me.

13:32.687 --> 13:34.356
<i>- I love you.</i>
- Mom!

13:43.365 --> 13:45.784
You tell Valentine he'll
never have the Cup.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.163
Don't drink! Come here!

13:56.378 --> 13:57.504
Come on!

14:18.775 --> 14:22.320
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?
- You okay? Alright, don't move.

14:44.009 --> 14:45.302
Mom?

14:49.556 --> 14:50.849
Mom?

17:28.256 --> 17:30.383
Come on. Come on.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.889
- That's enough!
- No!

17:36.890 --> 17:40.894
That's enough.
It's dead.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.397
What the hell was that?

17:46.608 --> 17:48.359
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.070
Try me.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.032
It was a demon.

17:56.785 --> 18:00.288
You're right.
I don't believe you.

18:01.664 --> 18:05.251
And that thing you saw me
kill at the club, that...

18:06.795 --> 18:08.379
that was also a demon.

18:09.547 --> 18:13.510
And demons can take possession of any
living creature. You can't trust anyone.

18:13.927 --> 18:15.678
Even people you think you know.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.056
So why should I trust you?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.188
I did just save your life.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.569
Dorothea, open up! Please.

18:34.697 --> 18:35.782
Can you...?

18:38.952 --> 18:40.829
<i>Do you know what happened
to my mom?</i>

18:45.333 --> 18:46.543
Do you?

18:48.419 --> 18:51.422
- Wait. You can see this guy?
- Of course she can, she's a witch.

18:55.927 --> 18:58.680
Downgraded from a gingerbread house
to a one-bedroom?

18:59.055 --> 19:02.099
- Do you know where my mom is?
- Sorry. I have no idea.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.727
Well, she mentioned a name: Valentine.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.855
- You better leave.
- No, please.

19:07.856 --> 19:10.942
Not until you tell me something.
Anything.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.182
Let's see what the cards have to say.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.850
I'm sorry, but you know
that I don't believe in any of...

19:44.851 --> 19:45.977
Sit.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.982
Run your hands over the cards.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.863
My mom painted these.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.032
Yes. They were a gift.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.118
Let's see which card gets picked.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.231
The Ace of Cups.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.900
- That's the Mortal Cup.
- So?

20:34.025 --> 20:35.150
Ignore him.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.236
It's a Mortal Instrument. One of the
three holy objects of my people.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.904
- What's it doing here?
- I don't understand...

20:38.905 --> 20:40.906
what any of this
has to do with my mom.

20:40.907 --> 20:44.409
Your mother was a Shadowhunter.
Like him.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.411
No, my mom is a painter.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.705
She never told you
any of this, did she?

20:48.706 --> 20:49.957
Look, all I know is that she's gone...

20:49.958 --> 20:52.085
and I have no idea where
to start looking for her.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.674
Let me read you.

21:20.321 --> 21:22.323
There's something blocking your mind.

21:23.741 --> 21:26.618
My guess is your mother hired someone
very skilled to protect you.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.247
- From what?
- Your own memories.

21:29.706 --> 21:33.251
Why? I don't remember anything
she'd want me to forget.

21:54.605 --> 21:55.648
Wait...

21:56.649 --> 21:58.026
Nice to meet you.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.124
What the hell?

22:13.750 --> 22:16.294
- You scared me.
- What the hell happened here?

22:18.129 --> 22:19.755
- My mom's missing.
- What?

22:19.756 --> 22:22.550
Someone took her
and destroyed the place.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.887
Well...

22:27.638 --> 22:30.349
this guy is helping me find her.

22:30.350 --> 22:33.061
But you can't see him. And he...

22:34.062 --> 22:35.188
Clary.

22:35.938 --> 22:38.941
Great. Okay,
now I can't see him, either.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.196
Jace Wayland.
Demon hunter.

22:45.573 --> 22:49.577
Simon Lewis. Keymaster.
Are you the Gatekeeper?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.078
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:51.079 --> 22:54.540
- So you can see him now?
- What?

22:54.957 --> 22:56.792
Of course I can see him.
What are you talking about?

22:56.793 --> 22:59.087
Just a sec.
This is so confusing.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.172
Who's this?

23:01.672 --> 23:03.716
It's my dad.
He died when I was two.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.557
Clary. So, wait.

23:11.933 --> 23:14.476
Your mom is gone...

23:14.477 --> 23:18.731
and you're hanging around with some
dyed-blond wannabe Goth weirdo?

23:19.482 --> 23:21.066
Where'd you come across this guy?

23:21.067 --> 23:24.694
- Well, I didn't... He found me.
- What? He found you.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.197
- I know it sounds.
- Check this.

23:26.864 --> 23:29.242
And for the record,
my hair's naturally blond.

23:32.078 --> 23:36.999
Clary, Clary, Clary, Simon?
She called you?

23:38.376 --> 23:39.710
Why didn't you pick up?

23:40.378 --> 23:42.504
If I'd known it was serious,
I would've picked up.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.590
Well, how would you know
if you didn't pick it up?

23:47.593 --> 23:48.761
What's that?

23:52.265 --> 23:53.516
Nothing good.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.767
Do you have any idea
where she found this?

23:55.768 --> 23:57.395
I've got to find Luke.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.117
It's so weird, his truck's here.

24:11.409 --> 24:12.785
This way.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.746
No, you wait here.

24:16.247 --> 24:17.748
Who made you the boss?

24:18.416 --> 24:20.793
It's okay. Just let us know
if anyone comes.

24:22.128 --> 24:25.047
I've known Luke all these years,
but I've never been down here.

24:35.683 --> 24:36.893
What?

24:37.143 --> 24:38.935
<i>- Come on, mate!
- I don't know.</i>

24:38.936 --> 24:43.524
<i>Now, listen, all you got to do,
mate, is tell me the truth.</i>

24:55.703 --> 24:58.205
<i>I'm telling you,
I don't know where the Cup is.</i>

24:58.206 --> 25:02.501
<i>I know you and Jocie are close.
I'm not stupid. Am I?</i>

25:02.502 --> 25:03.920
<i>Don't answer that.</i>

25:04.462 --> 25:08.090
<i>Listen to me, mate, just tell me
where the Mortal Cup is.</i>

25:09.175 --> 25:13.678
<i>And then Jocie will be fine.
Lukey, tell me. Tell me the truth.</i>

25:13.679 --> 25:16.681
<i>- I don't know.
- You don't want to make me angry!</i>

25:16.682 --> 25:18.184
I'm telling you!

25:20.102 --> 25:22.187
I'm going to ask you again, mate.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.690
- Where's the Cup?
- I don't know.

25:25.483 --> 25:28.569
We all want the same thing,
Lukey Boy, don't we?

25:29.237 --> 25:33.616
Difference is, I think you know
where it is. Don't you?

25:34.116 --> 25:35.868
Come on. Talk!

25:36.369 --> 25:38.955
- We need to go.
- No, please. You have to help him.

25:39.497 --> 25:42.583
You don't understand.
They work for Valentine.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.210
He's a dead man.
I can't help him.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.711
He's like family.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.883
You know what's really amazing, is how
much you actually look like a human.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.135
Isn't it great?

25:58.891 --> 26:00.100
Please.

26:00.101 --> 26:01.893
<i>Well, you're going to get mud,
you're going to change.</i>

26:01.894 --> 26:03.396
<i>I want to see you change.</i>

26:04.522 --> 26:06.524
Show me how you can change?

26:06.857 --> 26:07.984
Look at that.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.571
<i>Dog boy's coming on.</i>

26:12.572 --> 26:14.281
<i>You want to hump my leg?</i>

26:14.282 --> 26:16.617
You hump legs?
You like that?

26:16.784 --> 26:18.578
<i>You want to smell my derrière?</i>

26:21.998 --> 26:24.000
I want to see you change!

26:25.167 --> 26:27.752
You just got to tell me where
Jocelyn hid the Cup.

26:27.753 --> 26:31.507
Then you can have her back.
She'll be safe and sound.

26:33.926 --> 26:37.929
I don't want her back.
I couldn't care less.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.557
<i>I have spent years...</i>

26:40.558 --> 26:43.644
<i>cozying up to that woman
and her brat for the Mortal Cup.</i>

26:44.061 --> 26:45.896
Pangborn, listen to me.

26:46.063 --> 26:48.441
I want to be the one
to give it to Valentine.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.568
Yeah, right.

26:53.446 --> 26:56.072
You're making a big mistake.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.409
I don't believe you.
Do you believe him?

27:05.916 --> 27:07.710
- Clary, run!
- Clary, listen!

27:19.096 --> 27:23.934
Excuse me... officer,
I'd like to report a break-in.

27:24.602 --> 27:25.936
And a missing person.

28:05.851 --> 28:08.145
My friend's house
got broken into and...

28:10.106 --> 28:13.401
- Her mom is missing.
- Oh, no. Run!

28:24.662 --> 28:28.499
- You killed two cops!
- They weren't cops! Let's go.

28:40.052 --> 28:43.931
Clary. You can't stay here,
they'll find you.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.560
How could Luke
say that he didn't care?

28:48.060 --> 28:50.438
I've known him for as long
as I can remember.

28:51.272 --> 28:54.566
He used to read to me every night. He's
been picking me up at school for years.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.569
Maybe those memories aren't real.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.405
Do you remember what I told you?

29:00.030 --> 29:01.657
You can't trust anyone.

29:03.451 --> 29:05.034
I need to find my mom
and I have to go home!

29:05.035 --> 29:06.035
There must be something
that I missed!

29:06.036 --> 29:09.164
Listen to me, okay? We'll figure
this out, but not here and not now.

29:09.165 --> 29:10.916
We need to get you to a safe place.

29:11.917 --> 29:15.045
I'm a Shadowhunter, Clary,
and I will protect you with my life.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.966
There you guys are.
I thought you were right behind me.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.342
I thought I lost you.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.470
Okay, I'll follow you.

29:23.471 --> 29:25.722
Are you sure about that? Because
he just killed two cops!

29:25.723 --> 29:26.932
Yeah, they weren't cops.

29:27.808 --> 29:29.685
<i>They looked like real cops to me.</i>

29:29.935 --> 29:31.979
- They weren't real cops.
- Okay.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.691
So where did they get the car?

29:39.361 --> 29:40.988
They weren't real cops.

29:51.332 --> 29:52.625
We'll be safe in here.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.752
What is this dump?

29:55.377 --> 29:56.837
This isn't a dump.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.132
You just can't see it.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.502
What the hell is going on?
What are they doing in here?

30:37.044 --> 30:38.253
It's a demon bite.

30:38.254 --> 30:40.547
Clary. Jace, do something.

30:40.548 --> 30:42.048
This is the part where
you start tearing off...

30:42.049 --> 30:44.677
pieces of your shirt
to bind my wounds?

30:45.386 --> 30:48.013
If you wanted me to take my clothes
off, you should've just asked.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.535
She's waking up.

31:30.973 --> 31:34.684
I passed out and you guys tattooed me?
Thought that only happened in Vegas.

31:34.685 --> 31:36.561
- It's not a tattoo.
- It's a rune.

31:36.562 --> 31:40.315
They have them for everything. They
make you invisible, strong, they heal.

31:40.316 --> 31:43.067
They also make you visible.
That's why I can suddenly see him.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.945
- Even if you're hungry...
- No.

31:47.448 --> 31:50.826
The fact that the rune had an effect on
you explains why you can see us.

31:50.993 --> 31:53.369
- I don't get it.
- Mundanes can't survive the process.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.580
The runes are too strong
for them, so...

31:55.581 --> 31:57.707
Well, now we definitely know you have
Shadowhunter blood.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.500
Wait. It wasn't definite before?

31:59.501 --> 32:02.338
Well, it became definite
when she didn't die, yes.

32:02.713 --> 32:06.716
Here. See if these fit. It's not
every day we get guests in here.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.260
Especially not girls.

32:19.730 --> 32:23.525
Shouldn't we call the cops?
I mean the real ones?

32:24.360 --> 32:25.777
That's a great idea.

32:25.778 --> 32:28.739
I don't know why we haven't thought of
that for the past thousand years.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.242
Hodge is ready for her.

32:33.369 --> 32:35.663
He wants to see
her alone in the library.

32:37.498 --> 32:38.540
Who's Hodge?

32:38.749 --> 32:40.751
He's in charge of the Institute.

32:41.377 --> 32:42.503
Okay, let's go.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.798
Hundreds of Shadowhunters
used to seek asylum here.

32:45.923 --> 32:49.677
But, as you can see,
right now we're the only ones.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.013
Without the Mortal Cup,
we're a dying breed.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.808
Either you're born
of the Shadowhunter...

32:56.141 --> 32:58.060
or you have to drink
from the Mortal Cup.

33:05.776 --> 33:06.944
You coming?

33:10.280 --> 33:12.199
Pretty far from Brooklyn, isn't it?

33:13.784 --> 33:15.828
Stay away from Jace.

33:20.916 --> 33:23.167
You may find Hodge
a little eccentric.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.838
But he's one of the greatest
Shadowhunter that's ever lived.

33:26.714 --> 33:28.173
Here, give me that.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.588
Don't you think it's a bit risky...

34:08.589 --> 34:11.675
inviting a complete stranger
into the heart of the Institute?

34:12.259 --> 34:15.011
No. I think we can trust her.

34:15.012 --> 34:18.431
- And what about her mundane friend?
- Well, that was impulsive.

34:18.849 --> 34:21.143
When you're impulsive,
things go badly.

34:25.898 --> 34:30.194
Be careful. The rune to fix a broken
heart is the most painful one.

34:30.485 --> 34:33.197
They'll be out of here in a day.
I promise.

34:40.621 --> 34:41.663
Jace.

34:47.043 --> 34:50.547
She was one of the best,
your mum.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.217
- But I don't understand why she...
- Yesterday, you were...

34:54.384 --> 34:56.094
just a normal girl.

34:56.219 --> 35:01.225
Today, you feel as though your whole
world has been turned upside-down.

35:05.270 --> 35:08.065
There's only one thing
you need to know.

35:08.732 --> 35:11.193
The stories you were
told as a little girl...

35:11.652 --> 35:14.070
about monsters and nightmares...

35:14.071 --> 35:16.824
legends whispered around campfires...

35:18.909 --> 35:20.661
they're all true.

35:22.079 --> 35:24.164
- Demon?
- Yes.

35:28.210 --> 35:29.294
Demon?

35:29.503 --> 35:31.254
No. Werewolves aren't demons.

35:31.255 --> 35:33.215
We have a truce with Downworlders.

35:33.715 --> 35:37.927
Downworlders? What is that,
people below 14th Street?

35:37.928 --> 35:40.346
Well, Downworlders
pretty much sums everything up.

35:40.347 --> 35:43.266
Vampires, werewolves, warlocks.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.102
Warlocks. Cool.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.354
So how do you kill a zombie?

35:47.855 --> 35:50.523
- We don't.
- Of course. They're already dead.

35:50.524 --> 35:52.109
No. They don't exist.

35:54.528 --> 35:57.363
So that's the famous
Cup everyone's talking about.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.616
A replica. But, yes.

36:01.618 --> 36:05.037
You know, Jace has got
a real chip on his shoulder.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.799
You would, too, if you saw your father
murdered when you were a child.

36:07.958 --> 36:09.750
If it weren't for him,
we'd be dead.

36:09.751 --> 36:12.171
He saved our lives more times
than I care to admit.

36:14.756 --> 36:15.966
Right.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.556
<i>The legend goes...</i>

36:23.265 --> 36:26.059
The Crusaders summoned an angel.

36:27.019 --> 36:28.645
The Angel Raziel.

36:29.396 --> 36:32.064
Raziel poured his blood into a Cup...

36:32.065 --> 36:35.860
and those who drank from it became
half angel, half human.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.237
Shadowhunters.

36:38.030 --> 36:41.158
As did their children
and their children's children.

36:41.325 --> 36:43.326
Beings of immense power.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.870
Strong enough to restore balance...

36:45.871 --> 36:49.248
and protect the world
in a war against evil...

36:49.249 --> 36:51.293
a war that can never be won...

36:52.878 --> 36:55.088
but must always be fought.

36:57.007 --> 36:59.343
Demons don't die easily.

37:00.510 --> 37:04.556
Whereas we...
we remained all too mortal.

37:04.765 --> 37:07.809
Why didn't they just use the Cup
to create more Shadowhunters?

37:08.143 --> 37:10.186
Valentine's exact words.

37:10.187 --> 37:14.607
The Clave, the Keepers of the Cup,
they were afraid of using its power.

37:14.608 --> 37:17.778
They knew that hardly anyone
who drank from it survived.

37:18.445 --> 37:22.324
<i>Valentine Morgenstern drew
a circle of friends together...</i>

37:22.658 --> 37:25.869
<i>young idealistic Shadowhunters.</i> ..

37:28.038 --> 37:31.625
<i>To help him steal the Mortal Cup
from the Clave.</i>

37:33.919 --> 37:36.838
<i>But he didn't want to
protect humanity .</i>

37:37.422 --> 37:41.133
<i>He believed there had to be
an evolution of Shadowhunters...</i>

37:41.134 --> 37:43.135
<i>something more powerful.</i>

37:43.136 --> 37:46.139
<i>He began experimenting using
the Mortal Cup.</i>

37:46.723 --> 37:49.643
<i>He learned how to summon demons.</i>

37:51.270 --> 37:55.649
<i>He even injected himself with demon
blood so he could control them.</i>

37:56.400 --> 37:58.235
<i>He wanted to rule.</i>

37:59.903 --> 38:03.907
<i>Your mother, to prevent that,
stole the Cup from him...</i>

38:04.074 --> 38:06.284
and vanished into thin air.

38:06.285 --> 38:09.370
But if she's the only one that knows
where the Cup is then...

38:09.371 --> 38:12.916
Maybe she isn't.
Maybe she told someone else.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.878
Someone who doesn't know
she knows.

38:21.675 --> 38:23.510
The Silent Brothers are ready for her.

38:27.431 --> 38:28.931
Why didn't Hodge come with us?

38:28.932 --> 38:32.269
He hasn't left the Institute in years.
Some say it's a spell.

38:33.103 --> 38:34.938
He's agoraphobic.

38:40.736 --> 38:41.944
Is that him?

38:41.945 --> 38:44.031
No, that's Harold, the grounds keeper.

38:45.198 --> 38:46.366
That's him.

38:59.254 --> 39:02.883
<i>Are you sure you want
to go through with this?</i>

39:05.344 --> 39:08.013
<i>We will help you to remember.</i>

39:55.185 --> 39:56.395
You'll wake the dead.

40:00.565 --> 40:03.360
I can't believe this place
is just outside the city.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.086
Welcome to the City of Bones.

40:28.218 --> 40:30.762
This is where the Silent Brothers
draw their power...

40:30.887 --> 40:33.014
from the bones and ashes
of Shadowhunters.

40:34.474 --> 40:36.309
All of them are buried here?

40:36.476 --> 40:41.064
Yes. One day
that's going to be me.

40:51.032 --> 40:52.867
This is as far as I go.

40:52.868 --> 40:54.327
You'll be fine.

40:56.329 --> 40:58.039
So you've done this before?

41:00.250 --> 41:01.585
No.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.808
<i>You must listen with your mind.</i>

42:10.654 --> 42:11.863
<i>Mom?</i>

42:13.657 --> 42:15.492
<i>Mom?</i>

42:22.582 --> 42:25.001
<i>Go, go.</i>

42:29.923 --> 42:31.715
<i>Clary, this is Luke.</i>

42:31.716 --> 42:35.512
<i>My dearest friend.
You can trust him.</i>

42:35.929 --> 42:37.597
<i>Hi, Clary.</i>

42:39.349 --> 42:41.351
<i>Don't tell.</i>

42:52.779 --> 42:54.447
<i>Don't touch that old thing.</i>

42:56.366 --> 42:58.410
<i>It's just an old cup, Clary.</i>

43:04.708 --> 43:05.750
Clary...

43:06.710 --> 43:08.169
Clary, you okay?

43:08.712 --> 43:09.713
Clary.

43:15.468 --> 43:17.596
The block is stronger than anticipated.

43:18.471 --> 43:20.724
It can only be undone
by the one who put it there.

43:21.433 --> 43:23.393
I have no idea who put it there.

43:23.518 --> 43:24.769
You wrote it.

43:32.569 --> 43:34.737
Your mind remembers
the inverted image.

43:34.738 --> 43:36.740
You just have to
look at it differently.

43:38.408 --> 43:40.201
B-A-N-E.

43:41.953 --> 43:43.496
- Bane.
- Who?

43:43.788 --> 43:46.624
Magnus Bane. He's a Warlock.
I should have known.

43:46.625 --> 43:48.168
Well, let's go talk to him then.

43:48.585 --> 43:49.753
Not like that.

43:50.837 --> 43:52.714
You need some help from Isabelle.

43:54.174 --> 43:56.760
<i>- This is a top.</i>
- It's a dress.

43:58.678 --> 44:00.221
I can't pull this off.

44:00.597 --> 44:02.556
Well, actually with the right shoes...

44:02.557 --> 44:06.811
No. I mean, this dress is so tight
it's like a second skin.

44:08.772 --> 44:10.607
Don't you have anything else?

44:11.608 --> 44:13.359
If you go out looking like
your mundane self...

44:13.360 --> 44:15.778
we won't get within a hundred
feet of Magnus Bane.

44:15.779 --> 44:17.530
He's the High Warlock of Brooklyn.

44:18.031 --> 44:20.575
Now stop complaining.
Come over here.

44:23.370 --> 44:24.454
Hold this.

44:27.707 --> 44:29.959
That guy Alec doesn't
like me very much.

44:30.251 --> 44:32.045
That guy Alec is my brother.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.050
Does Jace know how Alec
feels about him?

44:39.552 --> 44:41.096
Is it that obvious?

44:41.388 --> 44:43.098
It's really not that big of a deal.

44:43.765 --> 44:48.061
It isn't to me, either.
But it is to the Clave.

44:48.478 --> 44:49.979
I don't make the rules.

44:52.065 --> 44:54.651
See? You're pretty.

44:55.819 --> 44:58.320
How is being dressed like a hooker
going to help me find my mom?

44:58.321 --> 45:00.323
Easy now, those are my clothes.

45:01.491 --> 45:03.075
Doesn't she look great, Alec?

45:03.076 --> 45:06.079
Looks like someone whose phone number
should be on a bathroom wall.

45:11.793 --> 45:13.253
I think you look great.

45:28.351 --> 45:31.020
Wait, I've been here.

46:00.717 --> 46:02.552
- Wait.
- What?

46:10.727 --> 46:13.563
- Is that better?
- That's better. Yeah.

46:28.161 --> 46:31.247
Well, well. Look here.

46:31.372 --> 46:33.917
I don't remember inviting
any children of the Nephilim.

46:34.167 --> 46:36.920
Magnus Bane.
We need to talk.

46:37.253 --> 46:40.672
You know I don't like you guys,
but I'll let you stay.

46:40.673 --> 46:42.090
But only because of the hot one.

46:42.091 --> 46:43.343
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

46:43.676 --> 46:44.677
What?

46:46.012 --> 46:47.347
I meant him.

46:47.680 --> 46:49.349
The one with the blue eyes.

46:52.352 --> 46:53.895
And because of Clary.

46:54.395 --> 46:56.438
Wait. How do you know her name?

46:56.439 --> 46:57.941
Come with me.

47:01.778 --> 47:03.446
- Where's your mother?
- She's missing.

47:04.989 --> 47:06.407
That explains it.

47:08.493 --> 47:10.202
Every year she brought you here.

47:10.203 --> 47:11.955
She never missed an appointment.

47:13.540 --> 47:16.709
Not every spell turns out as perfect
as the one I did on you.

47:19.295 --> 47:22.506
As soon as you started drawing
the Angelic rune...

47:22.507 --> 47:24.217
<i>it was a sign your memory
was surfacing.</i>

47:24.425 --> 47:27.929
<i>I'd built that into your mind, so that
she knew when to bring you back.</i>

47:28.721 --> 47:31.974
What you saw from the shadow
world, you would forget...

47:31.975 --> 47:33.434
even as you saw it.

47:33.726 --> 47:36.896
<i>But as you grew older, you needed
my treatment more frequently.</i>

47:37.313 --> 47:40.441
<i>She knew she had to tell you one day.
But until you were ready...</i>

47:40.733 --> 47:44.445
she wanted to keep the block on your
mind. It was exactly how she wanted it.

47:52.161 --> 47:53.871
<i>So, how long do you think
we're going to be here?</i>

47:53.872 --> 47:55.498
<i>Relax, Simon, okay.</i>

48:01.087 --> 48:02.171
Don't drink that!

48:04.841 --> 48:05.925
Simon!

48:09.512 --> 48:10.846
It'll wear off over time.

48:10.847 --> 48:13.266
It's already wearing off
or you wouldn't be here.

48:13.474 --> 48:14.893
I need to remember.

48:15.018 --> 48:18.271
My mom doesn't have time. Please,
there must be something you can do.

48:25.820 --> 48:28.448
You're the one who's been buying
all my mom's paintings.

48:31.034 --> 48:32.702
Why did you buy all of them?

48:33.494 --> 48:34.871
I knew she needed the money.

48:35.121 --> 48:37.081
You even have a portrait of my dad.

48:38.499 --> 48:42.044
That's not your dad.
He's a soldier who died in Iraq.

48:42.045 --> 48:43.922
Jocelyn never even met the guy.

48:44.047 --> 48:47.299
She was asked to paint his portrait
but it was too painful for the widow.

48:47.300 --> 48:50.140
- She kept the pictures, though...
- So she could pretend he was my dad.

48:52.972 --> 48:54.807
Everything she did,
she did for you.

48:55.058 --> 48:58.810
Your mother's whole existence...
the running, the hiding, the lies...

48:58.811 --> 49:00.063
were to keep you safe.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.316
Was anything she ever told me true?

49:05.902 --> 49:07.904
There's a treasure map
inside your head, Clary.

49:08.947 --> 49:10.990
Find the Cup and it will lead you
to your mother.

49:11.741 --> 49:13.076
They've taken Simon.

49:13.326 --> 49:15.286
- Who?
- Vampires.

49:17.330 --> 49:21.042
Just remember, it was Shadowhunters
your mother was running from.

49:23.753 --> 49:25.129
Let's go find Simon.

49:29.509 --> 49:31.760
<i>We can't break into
a Vampire's lair. We never learn...</i>

49:31.761 --> 49:33.888
- Don't start again.
- Jace, you know the rules.

49:34.389 --> 49:37.140
Guys, what are we doing here?
I thought we were trying to find Simon.

49:37.141 --> 49:39.936
We know where he is, we just
need to pick up a few things.

49:42.105 --> 49:44.346
What is this, some kind of deal
you have with the church?

49:45.858 --> 49:49.112
Demons exist all across the world
in their varying different forms.

49:49.570 --> 49:53.031
Shadowhunters cling
to no particular religion.

49:53.032 --> 49:55.117
And, in turn, all religions
assist us in our battle.

49:55.118 --> 49:59.664
We could have as easily gone to a
Jewish synagogue or a Shinto Temple.

50:02.166 --> 50:03.292
Here it is.

50:10.466 --> 50:12.927
Beneath every altar in every church...

50:15.138 --> 50:16.639
you'll find this.

50:29.610 --> 50:31.237
So what do you believe in?

50:31.696 --> 50:33.156
I believe in myself.

50:33.322 --> 50:35.907
I know my job is to kill demons. I
don't have to believe in anything else.

50:35.908 --> 50:38.661
- What about the Angel Raziel?
- It makes for a nice story.

50:38.870 --> 50:42.665
- But Hodge says...
- Hodge needs to get out more.

50:42.832 --> 50:44.166
- I thought...
- Listen...

50:44.167 --> 50:46.168
I've been hunting demons
for over a third of my life.

50:46.169 --> 50:49.047
And in all that time
I've never seen an angel.

50:49.464 --> 50:50.631
Here.

50:51.841 --> 50:53.176
Here, you take this one.

50:55.386 --> 50:58.472
- I don't...
- Here, let me show you.

50:58.473 --> 51:01.225
It's a vampire gun.
You must pierce the heart.

51:01.434 --> 51:03.019
Push it up against the chest.

51:04.187 --> 51:05.438
Fire.

51:08.191 --> 51:09.525
Recharge.

51:09.650 --> 51:10.943
Then you're good to go again.

51:18.618 --> 51:19.743
"Hotel of Death"?

51:19.744 --> 51:21.871
You can't say they don't have
a sense of humor.

51:22.455 --> 51:23.456
Come on.

51:27.460 --> 51:29.711
- What is it about her?
- She's brave.

51:29.712 --> 51:32.172
- We're Shadowhunters. We're all brave.
- She wasn't raised like us.

51:32.173 --> 51:34.967
- She's different.
- She's going to get us all killed.

52:36.779 --> 52:37.989
It's Simon's shirt.

53:11.314 --> 53:12.523
He's up here.

53:18.154 --> 53:19.197
Simon!

53:29.874 --> 53:32.543
- Oh my God!
- Clary, wait.

53:38.341 --> 53:40.051
- Clary!
- No, I can feel him!

53:41.844 --> 53:43.012
Give me a hand.

53:43.346 --> 53:44.639
Come on. Come on.

53:46.182 --> 53:47.600
These damn boots!

53:50.811 --> 53:53.648
- Here...
- There you go.

53:53.856 --> 53:55.608
Come on, guys, steady.

54:00.404 --> 54:02.031
Slowly.

54:11.082 --> 54:12.375
Careful.

54:13.292 --> 54:15.169
- He's alive!
- Careful.

54:17.380 --> 54:22.385
Go on. Get out. They don't want me,
they want you. They want the Cup!

54:38.234 --> 54:40.235
- Come on! Let's go.
- I'm good.

54:40.236 --> 54:41.570
Let's go.

54:42.113 --> 54:43.864
No, here.

54:56.252 --> 54:57.420
In here!

55:14.437 --> 55:15.646
Jace!

55:57.229 --> 55:58.439
Behind you!

56:22.755 --> 56:23.756
Come on!

57:23.482 --> 57:24.859
There's too many of them.

57:25.443 --> 57:26.819
Have a little faith.

57:56.474 --> 57:57.600
Run!

58:11.655 --> 58:13.115
Jace, I need a knife.

58:16.452 --> 58:18.454
- The sun!
- Let's go!

58:29.298 --> 58:30.633
You help Simon!

58:44.438 --> 58:45.523
Clary!

58:48.567 --> 58:49.568
Hold on!

59:03.249 --> 59:04.583
Thank you...

59:07.920 --> 59:09.630
for saving Simon.

59:23.352 --> 59:25.145
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

59:45.916 --> 59:46.959
<i>Clary.</i>

59:48.210 --> 59:49.544
Can I talk to you?

59:49.545 --> 59:51.630
Yeah. I was just going
to go see Simon.

59:54.466 --> 59:56.176
I want you to leave here.

59:56.302 --> 59:58.762
- What?
- You almost got us killed.

59:59.388 --> 01:00:02.724
I'm sorry. We didn't have a choice.
We had to save Simon. And Jace...

01:00:02.725 --> 01:00:05.519
Jace thinks he needs
to save the world.

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:08.479
But you don't need
to encourage him to do it.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.607
- But that's what you guys do.
- Yes!

01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:13.444
Us, what we do.

01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:16.196
We're a team.
You're dead weight...

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:19.325
- A mundane.
- I'm not a mundane!

01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:22.952
And if you were half as brave as you
pretend to be, you'd admit...

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.204
What?

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.456
You'd admit that you're
in love with Jace.

01:00:26.457 --> 01:00:28.208
And that's what this is really about!

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:32.755
If you ever say
anything like that again...

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:35.424
I'll kill you.

01:01:02.034 --> 01:01:04.536
- How long was I out?
- All day.

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:06.121
Found your glasses.

01:01:06.288 --> 01:01:08.040
One of the lenses cracked.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:18.801
How weird.

01:01:21.804 --> 01:01:23.764
I don't seem to need them anymore.

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:29.353
So, what are you drawing?

01:01:30.562 --> 01:01:31.855
Nothing.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:45.494
- You okay?
- Yeah, it was crazy.

01:01:49.665 --> 01:01:52.918
I'm sorry I didn't believe you before.
Now I get it.

01:01:55.087 --> 01:01:59.174
And... I must have passed out.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.761
And then you showed up.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:05.723
Liste, I know...

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:09.851
I've always been the one who
needed you more than you needed me.

01:02:09.852 --> 01:02:12.813
- It's not true.
- Yes, it is. But I never cared.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.282
I've only ever had my mom,
Luke and you.

01:02:24.158 --> 01:02:27.077
Don't ever imagine that
you aren't important to me.

01:02:28.287 --> 01:02:30.122
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:15.374
What did that piano ever do to you?

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.836
You play it like you've
lost your only love.

01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:20.713
Unfortunately, my one true love
remains myself.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.340
At least you don't have
to worry about rejection.

01:03:22.341 --> 01:03:23.466
Not necessarily.

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:26.136
I tear myself down occasionally
just to keep it interesting.

01:03:26.762 --> 01:03:28.471
You do play that with a lot of passion.

01:03:28.472 --> 01:03:30.932
Well, that's the problem.
I play it with too much emotion.

01:03:30.933 --> 01:03:33.768
It's supposed to be played with
a simple representation of notes.

01:03:33.769 --> 01:03:35.687
No interpretation.

01:03:38.774 --> 01:03:41.652
Music is supposed to have emotion.

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:47.950
Demons react to certain frequencies
when two tones cross.

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.202
It drives them crazy.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:56.040
See, Bach discovered this
and put it into a system...

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:59.043
using a mathematical progression
of tonal combinations.

01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:01.213
It allows us to expose demons.

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.635
So Bach was a Shadowhunter?

01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:08.761
Yes.

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:11.889
So Bach is to demons...

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:14.977
what garlic is to vampires.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:17.395
Kind of.

01:04:17.396 --> 01:04:21.233
I mean, you can run out of garlic.
You can't really run out of music.

01:04:24.987 --> 01:04:27.531
Is that where you keep
all your toys?

01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:31.910
It's way more fun.
Come on.

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:36.289
It's a portal. Like the Bermuda
Triangle, it's a natural phenomenon.

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:38.292
The Institute was built around it.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:41.795
Some say the Institute was
the first building in New York.

01:04:44.423 --> 01:04:47.049
Dimensions aren't all
just straight lines.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:50.470
There's bends, folds and nooks.

01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:53.098
It's a little bit difficult
to explain but...

01:04:54.016 --> 01:04:57.019
...the portal can take you wherever
you want to go in this dimension.

01:04:59.688 --> 01:05:02.023
So, as soon as you break
that surface...

01:05:02.024 --> 01:05:04.317
you're transported to wherever
your deepest thoughts lie.

01:05:04.318 --> 01:05:06.612
- So that means my mom!
- Wait!

01:05:07.863 --> 01:05:10.781
We spend our entire lives
training how to use it...

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:13.242
visualizing where it will take us
before we step into it...

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:16.038
and that takes incredible focus.

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:21.293
If you were to step into it
without the proper training...

01:05:21.877 --> 01:05:25.881
you could end up in limbo,
lost in your own mind forever.

01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:31.386
Here, let me show you.

01:05:32.054 --> 01:05:33.513
Come on.

01:05:36.058 --> 01:05:37.643
No peeking.

01:06:14.388 --> 01:06:15.806
Pretty cool, isn't it?

01:06:16.932 --> 01:06:21.520
Now, you and I...

01:06:22.104 --> 01:06:23.646
have a birthday to celebrate.

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:25.106
How did you know?

01:06:25.107 --> 01:06:27.985
Research,
when I was trying to find you.

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:35.951
<i>No one comes up here anymore.
We have the place to ourselves.</i>

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:39.037
This is breathtaking.

01:07:01.101 --> 01:07:02.601
Sorry, there's no cake.

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:06.148
I was expecting nothing.
So this is great.

01:07:07.441 --> 01:07:09.651
Well, everyone should get something
for their birthday.

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:17.993
- What did you get?
- Weapons, mostly.

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:23.582
- I'm sure that doesn't surprise you.
- At this point nothing really does.

01:07:26.418 --> 01:07:28.712
When I was nine...

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:32.173
my father gave me a falcon.

01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:34.133
He told me to make it obedient.

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:38.055
I was supposed to keep the bird blind,
but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

01:07:39.181 --> 01:07:42.350
Instead I touched and stroked its wings
until it trusted me.

01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:44.644
I tamed it to perfection.

01:07:45.937 --> 01:07:49.983
I took it to my father expecting him
to be proud of what I'd done.

01:07:50.859 --> 01:07:54.446
He said:
"I told you to make it obedient."

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:57.908
Instead you taught it to love you.

01:07:58.158 --> 01:08:00.160
You didn't tame it, you broke it...

01:08:01.161 --> 01:08:03.413
He took the bird and broke its neck.

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:07.459
I cried all night
and I never cried again.

01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:09.795
Did you ever forgive him?

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:13.381
He did it to make me stronger.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:20.846
Does that stand for Wayland?

01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:28.395
Midnight.

01:08:29.106 --> 01:08:30.273
Watch this.

01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:35.653
<i>When your soul Finds the soul</i>

01:08:35.654 --> 01:08:38.198
<i>It always waited for</i>

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:42.368
<i>When someone walks into your heart</i>

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:45.080
<i>Through an open door</i>

01:08:45.372 --> 01:08:49.166
<i>When your hand Finds the hand</i>

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:53.671
When a girl says she wants a big rock,
she doesn't literally mean a big rock.

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:56.091
Every Shadowhunter should have
their own witchlight.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:06.893
We have company.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:09.979
That's Hodge's bird.

01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:14.024
We should probably go.

01:09:14.401 --> 01:09:16.694
<i>Don't let go</i>

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:24.952
<i>When someone comes into your life</i>

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:29.916
<i>It's like they've
Been in your life forever</i>

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:35.839
<i>No There's no one else's eyes</i>

01:09:35.964 --> 01:09:37.965
<i>Who can see into me</i>

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:42.429
<i>No one else's arms can lift</i>

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:45.098
<i>Lift me up so high</i>

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:49.769
<i>Your love lifts me out of sight</i>

01:09:58.111 --> 01:10:00.551
<i>- And you know where I belong</i>
- Okay. We should definitely go.

01:10:03.450 --> 01:10:06.494
<i>But you know my heart by heart</i>

01:10:10.332 --> 01:10:13.376
<i>But you know my heart by heart</i>

01:10:18.256 --> 01:10:20.550
I'm sorry about the sprinkler system.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:22.344
I forgot about that.

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:27.098
Are you going to sleep?

01:10:27.265 --> 01:10:28.558
Are you tired?

01:10:29.017 --> 01:10:30.810
I've never been more awake.

01:10:36.858 --> 01:10:40.403
- Simon! I thought you were...
- Asleep? Yeah, I was.

01:10:40.654 --> 01:10:42.029
We were just...

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.490
Next time it might be a nice idea to
mention that you already have...

01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:47.409
a man in your bed, so we can avoid
such uncomfortable situations.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.703
- You invited him to bed?
- I know. It's ridiculous, isn't it?

01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:52.998
- We would never have all fit.
- I didn't invite him into bed.

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:54.501
We were just kissing.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:58.213
How swiftly you dismiss our love.

01:10:58.463 --> 01:10:59.506
Jace!

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:02.509
- It's late and I'm sorry we woke you.
- So am I.

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:07.429
Go ahead, go after him.
Go apologize to him.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:09.723
Go tell him just
how special he really is.

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:11.684
- Stop acting like that!
- Like what?

01:11:11.685 --> 01:11:13.102
Like nothing ever hurts you.

01:11:13.103 --> 01:11:15.981
Well, maybe you should have thought
about that <i>before</i> you kissed me.

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:17.607
I kissed you?

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.527
Don't worry.
It wasn't that special for me, either.

01:11:26.408 --> 01:11:27.574
I'm really sorry, Simon.

01:11:27.575 --> 01:11:30.537
- But weren't you just in the...
- I was just looking for you.

01:11:31.121 --> 01:11:33.080
- Where are you going?
- Home.

01:11:33.081 --> 01:11:35.207
It's clear I overstayed my welcome.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.126
I'm sorry, okay?
It wasn't like it was planned.

01:11:37.127 --> 01:11:40.212
Let me guess: it just happened.
Please!

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:44.550
- Look, I know you don't like him but...
- Actually, I hate the guy!

01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:46.885
- Why?
- I thought you were better than that.

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:48.555
And what's that supposed to mean?

01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:52.225
I'm the one who's always
been there for you, not him!

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:03.278
I'm in love with you.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:17.292
And it's clear that you don't
feel the same way.

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:20.253
- It's...
- Don't.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.088
There's nothing to say.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.512
And, Clary, he's just using you
to get the Cup.

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:36.311
Simon...

01:14:31.176 --> 01:14:34.012
Your mother was the only other person
who could do that.

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:37.098
But I've never been able
to do this before.

01:14:37.891 --> 01:14:41.060
Apparently, the block wasn't just
repressing your memories...

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:43.563
but your abilities as well.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:05.876
- Jace, I...
- Don't tell me.

01:15:05.877 --> 01:15:08.505
You have a drawing emergency
and you need a nude model.

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:10.715
- I'm not in the mood.
- Listen!

01:15:11.466 --> 01:15:13.468
I know where my mom hid the Cup.

01:15:26.397 --> 01:15:27.481
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:15:27.482 --> 01:15:29.901
Clary, wow.
You look different.

01:15:30.235 --> 01:15:32.612
Yeah, it's just something I borrowed.

01:15:33.279 --> 01:15:37.199
I mean, nice outfit.
It's good.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.910
Yeah... I can't talk now. Sorry.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:12.317
Clary.

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:13.735
I came for the Tarot cards.

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:15.153
<i>- Why?
- I need them.</i>

01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:16.823
<i>You know, the ones my mom painted.</i>

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:20.285
<i>I just need to look at them really
quickly and I'll give them back.</i>

01:16:21.661 --> 01:16:23.537
Those weapons can't come in here.

01:16:23.538 --> 01:16:25.373
This is a peaceful house.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:27.417
Put them in there.

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:16.716
How are you feeling today?

01:17:19.677 --> 01:17:22.555
Fine. Just fine.

01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:50.833
Young man, that piano's out of tune.

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:53.628
Please don't.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.350
Young man...

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.271
Stop.

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:25.785
That song...

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.372
not one of my favorites.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.520
Stop!

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:54.522
Let's have a look!

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:45.364
Clary, get out!

01:20:16.854 --> 01:20:19.524
Hi, Madame Dorothea.

01:20:19.690 --> 01:20:22.442
Have you seen Clary? I just got
a text that said she was here.

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:23.694
No.

01:20:24.529 --> 01:20:25.904
Okay. Well, I'll just...

01:20:25.905 --> 01:20:27.073
Simon!

01:20:28.199 --> 01:20:29.492
Simon!

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:33.830
Simon! It's not really her!

01:20:44.257 --> 01:20:45.508
I'll take care of him.

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:47.802
Simon!

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:49.428
She's got the Cup!

01:21:03.568 --> 01:21:04.694
Simon!

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.868
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:07.298
Jace!

01:22:11.928 --> 01:22:13.512
The runes aren't working.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.062
Simon, you follow me.

01:22:30.237 --> 01:22:31.697
You cut these up.

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:36.284
- Don't, you've done enough.
- Don't talk to her like that.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.286
- This isn't her fault.
- You're right. This is your fault.

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:39.913
- Isabelle!
- Alec kept telling you...

01:22:39.914 --> 01:22:42.707
that you were going to get hurt.
You were going to get us all hurt.

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:44.334
Now he's the one dying.

01:22:44.335 --> 01:22:45.669
Well, we needed to get the Mortal Cup.

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:48.470
But there are other ways to do it
than getting your best friend killed.

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:52.718
Why don't you go get Hodge?

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:57.223
I never wanted anything
to happen to Alec. I'm sorry.

01:23:02.228 --> 01:23:04.938
We agreed to do this together.
We're a team.

01:23:04.939 --> 01:23:06.983
Since Clary got here we haven't
been a team.

01:23:12.029 --> 01:23:13.197
Hodge!

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:15.157
<i>Hodge!</i>

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.660
Alec's getting worse.

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:18.953
I know.

01:23:20.121 --> 01:23:22.039
I've already sent for someone.

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:25.042
Did you get the Cup?

01:23:48.983 --> 01:23:50.151
What now?

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:56.657
Hodge.

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:07.960
You've no idea what it's
like living with the Clave's curse...

01:24:08.419 --> 01:24:11.172
unable to set so much
as a foot outside.

01:24:12.256 --> 01:24:14.967
Afraid to even open a window.

01:24:17.428 --> 01:24:19.889
Try not to judge me
too harshly, Clary.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:30.941
Hodge, what have you done?

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:56.842
I always knew you would
bring me the Cup.

01:24:57.093 --> 01:24:58.636
It was only a matter of time.

01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:03.265
Where is she?

01:25:05.392 --> 01:25:06.644
She's fine.

01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:12.691
You got what you want,
now let her go.

01:25:12.942 --> 01:25:14.985
I have to make sure you
gave me the real one.

01:25:18.072 --> 01:25:20.282
Everybody wants the Cup
for the wrong reason.

01:25:23.369 --> 01:25:24.786
And you don't?

01:25:24.787 --> 01:25:27.873
With this Cup
I can cleanse our bloodlines...

01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:30.501
save OUI' race.

01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:33.754
You might not know much
about mundane history...

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:37.924
but I can tell you when people start
talking about preserving a race...

01:25:37.925 --> 01:25:39.802
it never goes well.

01:25:41.387 --> 01:25:44.390
That's why my mom spent her
whole life hiding it from you.

01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:48.936
No. She wasn't hiding the Cup.

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.564
She was hiding you.

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:56.026
- Drink.
- I'm not going to drink that.

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:58.195
Why are you so afraid?

01:25:58.404 --> 01:26:00.531
You've been drinking this
since before you were born.

01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:04.493
I fed it to your mother while
you were in her womb.

01:26:06.745 --> 01:26:10.206
Come on, Clary.
You must have guessed by now.

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:14.502
These amazing talents that your mother
so desperately tried to suppress.

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:16.463
Where do you think they came from?

01:26:18.716 --> 01:26:20.134
You're my daughter.

01:26:21.135 --> 01:26:24.138
My blood runs in your veins.

01:26:24.597 --> 01:26:28.392
Now... drink.

01:26:31.478 --> 01:26:32.563
Drink!

01:26:43.949 --> 01:26:45.534
Take it out!

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:53.584
No!

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:07.556
Someone just went through the portal.

01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:09.183
I'll go check.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:47.155
Sorry. I got a bit carried away.

01:28:47.156 --> 01:28:49.240
- Luke, you're a...
- Clary, listen to me.

01:28:49.241 --> 01:28:52.536
- Listen. Don't be afraid. Listen.
- Don't touch me!

01:28:53.746 --> 01:28:55.164
Hey. There's no need for that.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:59.460
That thing will be back.
We are not safe out here.

01:29:02.713 --> 01:29:05.591
I jumped through the portal
to get away from Valentine.

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:07.634
I thought I'd
wind up with my mom.

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:14.391
Instead, I end up in the last place
I wanted to be.

01:29:15.351 --> 01:29:16.477
Listen...

01:29:16.894 --> 01:29:19.897
The portal brought you here because
you must have been thinking of me.

01:29:20.105 --> 01:29:22.190
Deep inside you know
you can trust me.

01:29:22.191 --> 01:29:24.693
You said you couldn't care less
what happened to either of us.

01:29:24.985 --> 01:29:26.694
You just want the Cup
like everyone else.

01:29:26.695 --> 01:29:29.197
I said that to protect you.
What else could I do?

01:29:29.198 --> 01:29:31.116
Been keeping an eye
on you this whole time.

01:29:39.333 --> 01:29:41.001
That was you at the hotel.

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:44.380
Good throw, by the way.

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:51.094
What about me?

01:29:51.095 --> 01:29:53.721
- What about you?
- We had a deal.

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:55.974
Well, I still don't have my Cup, do I?

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:04.149
I held up my end of the bargain.

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:09.029
- No, you didn't.
- I gave you the Cup.

01:30:09.613 --> 01:30:13.575
You handed it to Clary.
That's not my fault. Now lift it.

01:30:14.201 --> 01:30:18.454
Listen, it's all in your head.

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:20.165
No. No.

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:26.588
- There's a spell.
- Really? A spell?

01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:29.633
That's just an excuse
for a real problem...

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:31.510
in there.

01:30:32.845 --> 01:30:35.179
Do you really think I can fix that?

01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:38.016
I give you the Cup,
you take away the fear.

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:44.773
Without the Cup
I'm as stuck as you are.

01:30:45.691 --> 01:30:47.567
Except my fear is real.

01:30:47.568 --> 01:30:51.404
Every Downworlder,
every member of the Clave...

01:30:51.405 --> 01:30:52.989
every Shadowhunter...

01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:56.033
on both sides of the portal
is looking for me right now.

01:30:56.034 --> 01:30:58.120
I'm going to need
all the help I can get.

01:30:58.662 --> 01:31:01.748
You don't have to go
through with this, Valentine.

01:31:02.416 --> 01:31:05.252
A demon has never set foot
in the Institute.

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:10.257
Well, maybe it's time they did.

01:31:11.592 --> 01:31:14.803
I've been waiting
all these years to do this.

01:31:17.222 --> 01:31:19.224
Clary's given me no choice.

01:31:22.436 --> 01:31:23.812
She'll come back.

01:31:25.522 --> 01:31:26.899
Really?

01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:29.233
And what makes you so sure?

01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:31.904
There's someone here she wants
as much as her mother.

01:31:32.654 --> 01:31:35.365
If you lie and tell them they're
both your children...

01:31:37.284 --> 01:31:39.077
you'll break their hearts.

01:31:39.453 --> 01:31:40.787
What can I say?

01:31:41.413 --> 01:31:43.790
The broken make the best followers.

01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:48.921
Look at you.
To love is to destroy.

01:32:45.102 --> 01:32:48.105
Where the hell is Hodge?
We don't have much time.

01:32:50.232 --> 01:32:51.817
Does this look right to you?

01:32:53.652 --> 01:32:54.736
No.

01:32:55.571 --> 01:32:56.905
Hey, look.

01:32:59.324 --> 01:33:00.617
Magnus?

01:33:03.287 --> 01:33:05.747
I'm going to need all of this.
Lots of it.

01:33:08.208 --> 01:33:09.501
Take this.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:44.786
Lock this place down.

01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:06.183
Don't do that!

01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:08.685
Valentine.

01:34:09.394 --> 01:34:10.604
Jonathan.

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:13.982
How do you know my real name?

01:34:15.609 --> 01:34:17.277
Nobody calls me that.

01:34:18.111 --> 01:34:22.407
Is it true?
Is Valentine my father?

01:34:29.039 --> 01:34:31.041
You know, he was a great man...

01:34:31.416 --> 01:34:32.834
until his conflict with the Clave.

01:34:33.502 --> 01:34:35.378
<i>But when your mother
ran away with the Cup...</i>

01:34:35.379 --> 01:34:38.631
<i>he was just so afraid
of retribution from the Clave...</i>

01:34:38.632 --> 01:34:41.009
<i>he burnt their house to the ground.</i>

01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:46.264
<i>He wanted the world
to believe he was dead.</i>

01:34:47.432 --> 01:34:51.687
<i>In the ashes we found the remains
of a man and a child.</i>

01:34:52.604 --> 01:34:54.230
Wait a second, there was a child?

01:34:54.231 --> 01:34:55.815
Valentine was so enraged...

01:34:55.816 --> 01:34:58.443
he wanted her to believe he killed
himself and their son...

01:34:59.611 --> 01:35:00.779
your brother.

01:35:01.947 --> 01:35:03.407
I have a brother?

01:35:08.829 --> 01:35:10.956
Jonathan Christopher Morgenstern.

01:35:11.748 --> 01:35:16.002
You're lying.
My name is Jace Wayland.

01:35:17.129 --> 01:35:19.256
And my family are the Wayland.

01:35:20.424 --> 01:35:23.260
You think Clary is the only one
with a block in her mind?

01:35:25.011 --> 01:35:26.888
Let me show you the truth.

01:35:31.935 --> 01:35:34.312
You didn't tame him.
You broke him.

01:35:34.896 --> 01:35:35.939
No!

01:35:38.150 --> 01:35:39.693
You are not my father.

01:35:41.486 --> 01:35:44.364
I came back to help you understand
who you really are.

01:35:46.742 --> 01:35:50.495
I know you're unhappy here.
Plagued by rules.

01:35:51.747 --> 01:35:56.209
Your place is next to me.

01:35:56.877 --> 01:36:01.131
You're a Morgenstern.
And you're my son.

01:36:14.728 --> 01:36:16.563
My name is Jace Wayland.

01:36:19.733 --> 01:36:21.318
I'm a Wayland.

01:36:22.444 --> 01:36:26.031
Sorry to break this to you,
but it's time you heard the truth.

01:36:27.032 --> 01:36:28.116
Don't.

01:36:31.036 --> 01:36:33.079
It's all a matter of perception.

01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:38.335
You see? Morgenstern.

01:36:59.773 --> 01:37:01.233
- Take this.
- Okay.

01:37:14.079 --> 01:37:15.121
Isabelle...

01:37:33.807 --> 01:37:36.059
Clary?
We found your mom.

01:37:36.309 --> 01:37:39.187
They found her.
She's at the Institute.

01:37:42.607 --> 01:37:43.941
Alaric.

01:37:43.942 --> 01:37:46.277
<i>It's Luke, can you see it?</i>

01:37:46.278 --> 01:37:47.737
Yeah, I see it.

01:37:49.865 --> 01:37:52.325
Guys, we have to go.
Luke needs us.

01:37:52.617 --> 01:37:55.619
- Where're we headed?
- The Institute.

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:57.204
We'd be breaking the accords.

01:37:57.205 --> 01:37:58.748
Not if we stay human.

01:37:59.833 --> 01:38:02.543
- Let's go, guys!
- Go, go!

01:38:02.544 --> 01:38:03.712
Come on, move it!

01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:12.846
Move it!

01:38:13.138 --> 01:38:15.431
Ready to go.
They've all been briefed.

01:38:15.432 --> 01:38:17.434
This is Alaric.
He's one of us.

01:38:22.355 --> 01:38:25.859
Go ahead. You can hang your head out
the window if you need to.

01:38:26.568 --> 01:38:30.363
I'm a Werewolf,
not a Golden Retriever.

01:38:35.452 --> 01:38:36.536
<i>Simon!</i>

01:38:39.664 --> 01:38:41.582
- Just wait here, I'll be back.
- What? No.

01:38:41.583 --> 01:38:44.711
Isabelle, I can't just...
No. Isabelle.

01:38:48.715 --> 01:38:51.009
Come on, Isabelle, where are you?

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.890
Alright, move it!

01:38:57.515 --> 01:38:58.808
Come on, move it!

01:39:05.815 --> 01:39:06.983
Alright.

01:39:07.567 --> 01:39:09.361
The werewolves are here to save us.

01:39:10.695 --> 01:39:12.280
Never thought I'd say that.

01:39:17.953 --> 01:39:19.621
Finally! Isabelle.

01:39:21.247 --> 01:39:22.791
<i>Open up the door.</i>

01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:56.992
It looks like he's responding.
He'll survive.

01:40:01.162 --> 01:40:02.706
And be careful.

01:40:04.916 --> 01:40:06.626
You're being invaded.

01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:16.886
<i>Summoning all these bloody demons...</i>

01:40:45.749 --> 01:40:47.083
Run!

01:40:55.133 --> 01:40:56.217
Run!

01:40:56.718 --> 01:40:59.095
- Where are we going?
- There's another exit!

01:41:00.305 --> 01:41:01.306
Wait.

01:41:15.445 --> 01:41:16.696
Isabelle!

01:41:17.864 --> 01:41:19.949
- I almost killed you.
- Yeah.

01:41:21.868 --> 01:41:23.661
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:25.704
This place is full of demons.

01:41:25.705 --> 01:41:28.999
That's impossible.
The Institute is hallowed ground.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.919
No one seems to have told them that.

01:41:31.836 --> 01:41:33.713
Someone on the inside
must have let them in.

01:41:41.429 --> 01:41:45.016
This is a rescue mission.
We are not equipped to fight demons.

01:41:56.444 --> 01:41:57.987
Spread out! That way.

01:42:00.281 --> 01:42:01.950
Move back! Come on!

01:42:17.215 --> 01:42:19.092
We could use some help, Alaric!

01:42:21.136 --> 01:42:22.262
Alaric!

01:42:25.515 --> 01:42:27.349
Come on. There must be some
other way out of here, right?

01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:28.600
No, there isn't, Simon!

01:42:28.601 --> 01:42:30.395
We can't hold them much longer.

01:43:19.277 --> 01:43:20.445
Step away.

01:43:22.405 --> 01:43:23.531
Step away!

01:43:53.561 --> 01:43:56.898
Clary, which rune is that?

01:43:57.815 --> 01:43:59.942
- I don't know, it's just...
- I've never seen it before.

01:43:59.943 --> 01:44:02.028
- Really?
- It's not in the book.

01:44:05.531 --> 01:44:06.658
It's fading.

01:44:29.847 --> 01:44:32.350
They're coming in through somewhere.
I'm going to stop them.

01:44:37.105 --> 01:44:38.189
Come on.

01:44:38.606 --> 01:44:40.900
You guys go.
We'll catch up.

01:45:00.003 --> 01:45:01.045
No!

01:45:29.365 --> 01:45:31.576
They're coming from the Dome.
Come on.

01:45:43.796 --> 01:45:48.009
Jocelyn, you never left my heart.

01:45:48.593 --> 01:45:50.386
I've come to take you home.

01:45:52.972 --> 01:45:55.266
She's not going anywhere.

01:45:57.310 --> 01:45:59.062
How did you get up here?

01:46:04.609 --> 01:46:07.444
You're even more powerful
than I anticipated.

01:46:07.445 --> 01:46:09.072
Get away from her.

01:46:14.744 --> 01:46:16.036
What the hell?

01:46:16.037 --> 01:46:17.789
Just listen to what he has to say.

01:46:19.499 --> 01:46:20.958
It's not what you think.

01:46:24.337 --> 01:46:25.671
Finally...

01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:29.300
both my children together.

01:46:29.675 --> 01:46:33.388
My daughter and my son.

01:46:35.098 --> 01:46:36.641
I'm so sorry, Clary.

01:46:38.601 --> 01:46:39.936
I didn't know.

01:46:41.604 --> 01:46:43.106
Valentine's lying.

01:46:43.356 --> 01:46:46.650
You're Michael Wayland's son.
Luke said my brother is dead.

01:46:46.651 --> 01:46:49.487
He died in a fire and they found
his remains in the ashes.

01:46:50.113 --> 01:46:52.489
I took Jonathan with me when I ran.

01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:54.992
The bones were
of a child killed by wolves.

01:46:58.037 --> 01:46:59.539
I wish it wasn't true.

01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:04.669
She doesn't want to believe you...

01:47:06.045 --> 01:47:10.048
because she is in love
with you, Jonathan.

01:47:10.049 --> 01:47:12.009
I thought your name was Jace.

01:47:13.761 --> 01:47:15.388
Jace is a nickname.

01:47:20.685 --> 01:47:22.687
Jonathan Christopher...

01:47:24.814 --> 01:47:26.399
J.C.

01:47:29.152 --> 01:47:30.445
Jace.

01:48:08.274 --> 01:48:09.442
There's the lever.

01:48:09.775 --> 01:48:11.903
You go close the dome
and I'll hold them off.

01:48:20.244 --> 01:48:22.163
Take out the Cup, Clary.

01:48:26.959 --> 01:48:30.086
Take out my Cup!
I want that Cup!

01:48:30.087 --> 01:48:31.756
You said you wouldn't hurt her!

01:48:41.599 --> 01:48:42.975
That's enough.

01:48:44.602 --> 01:48:45.686
Now!

01:48:51.234 --> 01:48:53.319
- It's stuck!
- Close it!

01:48:53.778 --> 01:48:54.946
I can't!

01:48:55.863 --> 01:48:57.698
I think there's a piece missing!

01:49:04.664 --> 01:49:05.790
Clary!

01:49:25.518 --> 01:49:27.144
I really need this!

01:49:50.751 --> 01:49:51.836
Mom?

01:50:48.434 --> 01:50:50.561
- Find the others.
- Alright.

01:50:51.979 --> 01:50:55.399
Alright. You want to take
the upstairs or the downstairs?

01:50:57.818 --> 01:51:00.404
I'm not too crazy about the basement.

01:51:06.494 --> 01:51:08.579
I can't hold them back any longer.

01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:12.541
Simon, hurry!

01:51:22.259 --> 01:51:24.470
Clary.

01:51:31.018 --> 01:51:33.020
Hello, Mr. Garroway.

01:51:33.354 --> 01:51:36.816
Looks like you're having a "ruff" day.

01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:42.445
I guess the humane thing to do
in this situation...

01:51:42.446 --> 01:51:44.031
would be to put you down.

01:51:44.699 --> 01:51:46.867
But you wanted to see me change?

01:51:47.034 --> 01:51:48.452
I do.

01:51:58.045 --> 01:51:59.296
Get up!

01:52:00.673 --> 01:52:03.759
So, boy, how far
do you want to take this?

01:52:06.137 --> 01:52:07.388
To the end.

01:52:30.161 --> 01:52:31.162
Simon!

01:53:09.033 --> 01:53:10.075
Isabelle!

01:53:19.668 --> 01:53:20.753
Lean on me!

01:53:38.521 --> 01:53:40.980
- Get out! Go on!
- Okay.

01:53:40.981 --> 01:53:42.358
Get out of here!

01:53:45.069 --> 01:53:46.153
Come on.

01:53:49.824 --> 01:53:50.950
Go!

01:53:56.038 --> 01:53:58.624
Somebody told me that
you like to play music.

01:54:01.502 --> 01:54:03.587
Johann would be very proud.

01:54:13.597 --> 01:54:16.225
Now you shall die by Raziel's sword.

01:54:17.101 --> 01:54:18.269
Stop!

01:54:19.144 --> 01:54:20.813
Or I'll drop it!

01:54:21.021 --> 01:54:22.565
You don't want to do that.

01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:24.650
Don't give it to him, Clary.

01:54:32.032 --> 01:54:33.742
I need you to listen to me.

01:54:35.452 --> 01:54:38.122
As your father, I'm begging you.

01:54:44.044 --> 01:54:46.880
If you'd been a real dad,
you'd know me well enough...

01:54:46.881 --> 01:54:48.632
to imagine where the Cup is.

01:54:48.757 --> 01:54:51.010
Where my deepest
thoughts are taking it.

01:54:52.511 --> 01:54:54.305
You don't know
the first thing about me.

01:54:56.181 --> 01:55:01.061
You're not my dad.
And you never will be.

01:55:01.353 --> 01:55:04.106
I promise you'll never
have to see me again.

01:55:10.237 --> 01:55:11.947
Thank you, Clary.

01:55:16.076 --> 01:55:19.163
Without this Cup, we are lost.

01:55:19.872 --> 01:55:21.165
Not we...

01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:24.668
You.

01:55:49.526 --> 01:55:51.028
Clary, no!

01:55:53.906 --> 01:55:56.116
- Don't let me go!
- Never!

01:55:59.119 --> 01:56:00.204
Here!

01:56:59.138 --> 01:57:00.723
Are you okay?

01:57:01.390 --> 01:57:02.766
I don't know.

01:57:42.473 --> 01:57:44.808
I understand why you did what you did.

01:57:47.311 --> 01:57:48.979
And I forgive you.

01:57:50.439 --> 01:57:52.232
I want you to know that...

01:57:54.234 --> 01:57:56.361
your secret's safe with me.

01:58:48.288 --> 01:58:49.456
Hey.

01:58:50.249 --> 01:58:53.085
So, how's she doing?

01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:54.503
Stable.

01:58:55.379 --> 01:58:59.258
The doctors don't know what she took,
so we just have to wait.

01:59:03.428 --> 01:59:04.888
I'm sorry.

01:59:05.264 --> 01:59:07.141
I guess I'm an old romantic.

01:59:07.307 --> 01:59:11.477
I always hoped that when I finally
said "I love you" to someone...

01:59:11.478 --> 01:59:13.229
she'd say the same thing back.

01:59:13.230 --> 01:59:16.483
- And that someone will.
- Yeah. I know.

01:59:25.742 --> 01:59:29.288
You're tired, go sleep.
We'll take care of her.

01:59:30.747 --> 01:59:32.833
- Okay.
- Yeah? Come on.

01:59:39.715 --> 01:59:44.136
<i>Underneath the echoes</i>

01:59:44.344 --> 01:59:48.848
<i>Buried in the shadows</i>

01:59:48.849 --> 01:59:52.603
<i>To see your ghost</i>

01:59:53.395 --> 01:59:56.982
<i>But you must know</i>

01:59:57.149 --> 02:00:02.487
<i>I'll be here waiting</i>

02:00:02.779 --> 02:00:08.368
<i>Hoping, praying that</i>

02:00:09.411 --> 02:00:13.457
<i>This light will guide you home</i>

02:00:14.374 --> 02:00:19.838
<i>When you're feeling lost</i>

02:00:20.088 --> 02:00:24.008
<i>I'll leave my love</i>

02:00:24.009 --> 02:00:25.570
I like what you've done with the place.

02:00:26.094 --> 02:00:27.930
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.

02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:32.476
Clary, we're afraid
you're not coming back.

02:00:34.019 --> 02:00:35.645
It's just really hard
to be around you right now.

02:00:35.646 --> 02:00:37.314
It's hard for me, as well.

02:00:38.982 --> 02:00:40.984
But this is about more than us.

02:00:42.986 --> 02:00:45.572
You have an incredible gift
and we need you.

02:00:48.617 --> 02:00:49.993
I need you.

02:00:51.286 --> 02:00:52.788
I just don't know.

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:55.916
Remember when I said
I'd never seen an angel?

02:01:00.003 --> 02:01:01.213
Well, I lied.

02:01:11.014 --> 02:01:13.183
You're still the bravest mundane
I've ever met.

02:01:17.437 --> 02:01:18.981
I'm not a mundane.

02:01:21.608 --> 02:01:22.984
Wait, Jace!

02:01:22.985 --> 02:01:26.697
<i>Be here waiting</i>

02:01:27.447 --> 02:01:28.824
You took your time.

02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:37.374
You said you needed me.

02:01:39.001 --> 02:01:42.378
<i>When you're feeling</i>

02:01:42.379 --> 02:01:44.881
- You should keep that safe.
- Yeah.

02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:48.260
Is it okay if I...?

02:01:49.344 --> 02:01:52.764
- Do I...? Is it okay if I...?
- Yeah.

02:01:56.101 --> 02:01:58.061
Look, Clary, I don't believe it.

02:01:58.562 --> 02:02:00.897
It doesn't feel like the truth.
Not in my heart.

02:02:01.898 --> 02:02:04.484
I just don't know how to look
at the world anymore.

02:02:05.027 --> 02:02:09.865
I don't see streets and traffic lights
and cars. I see demons and angels.

02:02:10.782 --> 02:02:13.368
- Everything's different.
- The world's the same.

02:02:14.536 --> 02:02:16.371
You're the one who's different.

02:02:23.128 --> 02:02:25.714
- Don't you remember what Hodge said?
- What?

02:02:26.048 --> 02:02:27.924
All the stories are true.

02:02:29.593 --> 02:02:33.680
