WEBVTT

00:01.242 --> 00:04.003
[Hawkeye] Seven, carry
the three, times 28...

00:04.078 --> 00:05.729
[Ms. Marvel]
Here are the new receipts.

00:05.731 --> 00:07.506
[sighs]
Put 'em there with the others.

00:09.084 --> 00:10.342
[frustrated groan]

00:12.254 --> 00:15.830
So, uh, is all that
because of me?

00:15.908 --> 00:18.166
I don't know, Hulk. You tell me.

00:18.244 --> 00:21.595
Millions of dollars in damages from
when you knocked over a warehouse,

00:21.671 --> 00:23.247
from when you smashed
the loading docks,

00:23.249 --> 00:26.007
from when you stomped on a
tanker truck full of gasoline...

00:26.085 --> 00:29.253
But the truck was already
on fire when I got there.

00:29.255 --> 00:32.756
And from when you smashed that toy
factory that makes talking teddy bears.

00:32.758 --> 00:36.777
Hey, those mouthy little bears
had it coming.

00:36.853 --> 00:40.355
Come on, Hawkeye.
Smashing is what Hulk does best.

00:40.432 --> 00:44.025
Against an alien invasion
or cyborg army, sure.

00:44.103 --> 00:46.270
But somebody's gotta
take care of all this.

00:46.272 --> 00:48.939
You gotta work
on suppressing that rage.

00:48.941 --> 00:51.550
I'm suppressing my rage now.

00:51.627 --> 00:54.219
[alarm blaring]

00:54.296 --> 00:56.204
Avengers Compound,
hold your fire!

00:56.282 --> 00:57.222
[Ms. Marvel] Black Panther?
[all grunt]

00:57.299 --> 01:00.300
Hawkeye, stop trying
to shoot us down.

01:00.377 --> 01:02.728
There's nobody firing at you.

01:02.805 --> 01:04.114
It's just me, Hulk,
and Ms. Marvel.

01:04.138 --> 01:07.399
[beeping] Cap's right.
Somebody's on the roof!

01:07.476 --> 01:09.184
Then that someone's
gonna get smashed!

01:17.303 --> 01:20.061
[grunts]

01:20.139 --> 01:22.730
You attack my friends,
then you're just begging

01:22.808 --> 01:24.157
to get smashed! [Roars]

01:25.902 --> 01:28.036
Doctor Strange? [Grunts]

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.492 --> 01:42.250
Get out of the way, Hulk.

01:42.328 --> 01:44.919
[grunts, yells]

01:44.997 --> 01:47.606
All is not as it seems.

01:47.683 --> 01:50.183
Oh, well, that's a relief,
'cause it seems

01:50.260 --> 01:52.020
like you're trying
to shoot down our friends.

01:54.523 --> 01:58.675
[grunts] My own arrow?
Are you kidding me?

01:58.677 --> 02:00.360
Nice to meet you,
Doctor Strange.

02:00.437 --> 02:04.289
Now, this may sting a little bit.
[grunts] [grunts]

02:04.366 --> 02:08.243
Ms. Marvel, you are interfering
in matters you don't understand.

02:10.947 --> 02:13.190
[roars] [grunts]

02:13.192 --> 02:16.301
[Hulk] And you're interfering
with the Avengers!

02:16.378 --> 02:19.196
Release me! You don't
know what you're doing!

02:19.198 --> 02:23.142
[frustrated grunting]

02:23.218 --> 02:24.770
[Captain America]
We have questions, Doctor.

02:24.794 --> 02:26.105
Let's start with why
you were attacking us.

02:26.129 --> 02:30.482
I assure you, I was not
aiming at the Avengers.

02:30.559 --> 02:33.543
Funny. Sure looked like it.

02:33.545 --> 02:36.858
[Black Panther] Doctor Strange, the Avengers
have never had reason not to trust you.

02:36.882 --> 02:38.899
Till now.

02:38.975 --> 02:42.828
We do need to know what's going on
and why Doctor Strange is here.

02:42.905 --> 02:44.997
Get him out of the restraints.

02:45.073 --> 02:46.890
No need. I can do it myself.

02:46.892 --> 02:48.241
Peribittio.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.895
[growls] My apologies,

02:51.897 --> 02:55.248
but you were transporting
with you something...

02:55.325 --> 02:57.734
Or someone...
That shouldn't be here.

02:57.736 --> 03:01.996
I am the keeper
of the Eye of Agamotto.

03:02.074 --> 03:05.575
The Eye sensed a presence not felt in
this realm for thousands of years.

03:05.577 --> 03:08.187
It sensed the presence...
of Agamotto.

03:08.263 --> 03:10.672
[gasps]

03:10.749 --> 03:12.340
Okay, I have no idea
who that is.

03:12.418 --> 03:14.342
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:14.420 --> 03:16.361
As in "Eye of Agamotto"?

03:16.438 --> 03:18.530
Agamotto is an actual guy?

03:18.607 --> 03:22.016
All this time we've known you,
you've been wearing

03:22.094 --> 03:24.036
his eye around your neck?

03:24.112 --> 03:26.020
Ew.

03:26.098 --> 03:28.281
Long ago, Agamotto was

03:28.358 --> 03:30.525
the first sorcerer supreme.

03:30.602 --> 03:34.438
But his hunger for the knowledge and
power of the unknown had no end,

03:34.440 --> 03:36.940
and he became corrupt and evil.

03:36.942 --> 03:40.201
Agamotto was banished,
but not before his powers

03:40.279 --> 03:42.629
were passed into this amulet

03:42.706 --> 03:45.057
called the Eye of Agamotto.

03:45.133 --> 03:49.210
By the Vishanti,
you mortals love to talk.

03:49.288 --> 03:52.956
The Eye sees all.

03:52.958 --> 03:55.976
Even the deceit
of its former owner, Agamotto.

04:03.802 --> 04:07.637
No need to wear
this disguise anymore.

04:07.639 --> 04:09.656
The Eye is all that matters.

04:09.733 --> 04:12.492
The rest of you
are of no consequence.

04:14.663 --> 04:16.738
[all grunt]

04:16.815 --> 04:19.072
[gasps, yells]

04:19.151 --> 04:21.317
Your world is lost in chaos.

04:21.320 --> 04:27.415
The Eye of Agamotto will restore
me to my full cosmic power

04:27.493 --> 04:30.102
so that I can cleanse
this wretched realm.

04:30.178 --> 04:33.596
Now give me the Eye. [Yells]

04:37.427 --> 04:38.518
[grunts]

04:47.679 --> 04:49.529
[grunts, laughs] [grunts]

04:53.276 --> 04:54.701
You know the rules, Agamotto.

04:54.778 --> 04:57.687
The Eye cannot be taken,
even by you.

04:57.689 --> 05:01.967
It must be given freely, and that
is not something I choose to do.

05:02.044 --> 05:04.452
Then you've chosen your fate.

05:04.530 --> 05:05.628
After all...

05:07.866 --> 05:10.884
[gasps, grunts]

05:10.960 --> 05:15.147
The dead have no
possessions to bestow.

05:15.223 --> 05:17.640
[laughing] Hmm?

05:28.554 --> 05:30.720
[grunts]

05:30.722 --> 05:32.906
[roars, grunts]

05:32.982 --> 05:34.074
[roaring]

05:34.150 --> 05:36.451
There, foolish ogre.

05:38.564 --> 05:39.564
[grunts, yells] [thud]

05:42.158 --> 05:43.508
[chain clangs] Mm...

05:43.585 --> 05:47.328
Huh? [Growling]

05:47.406 --> 05:51.183
[laughs] Your token
resistance is pathetic.

05:51.259 --> 05:54.001
Venix, holbrum, ascaria!

05:54.079 --> 05:56.096
Hurry it up, Doc!

05:56.172 --> 05:57.522
Hmm? Mm.

05:57.599 --> 05:59.524
You cannot defeat Agamotto

05:59.601 --> 06:01.526
with conventional tactics.

06:04.773 --> 06:06.180
Yeah!

06:06.258 --> 06:08.349
[growls]

06:08.427 --> 06:10.202
[roars]

06:10.278 --> 06:11.444
Aah!

06:14.449 --> 06:15.782
[grunts]

06:18.194 --> 06:19.194
[Hawkeye] Get down!

06:22.608 --> 06:26.292
[groans] Still, you try
to fight against me.

06:26.369 --> 06:28.887
Then I will make you fight for me.
[groans]

06:28.964 --> 06:32.724
Corse Predominate!

06:32.801 --> 06:34.559
[both groan]

06:38.715 --> 06:42.809
By the Hoary Hosts of Hoggoth!
He's used the shadows curse!

06:42.886 --> 06:43.893
What does that do?

06:47.132 --> 06:48.132
[bodies thud]

06:52.154 --> 06:54.562
Cap and Panther?

06:54.640 --> 06:56.823
These are not our friends.

06:56.900 --> 06:58.900
These are shadows,
cursed by the darkness.

06:58.977 --> 07:00.994
[Agamotto laughing]

07:01.070 --> 07:03.922
Fulfill your evil purpose,
my puppets,

07:03.999 --> 07:06.591
and destroy your friends!

07:13.341 --> 07:15.767
[grunts]

07:15.844 --> 07:18.995
So, these aren't
Cap and Panther?

07:18.997 --> 07:21.514
No. These are only shadow copies
of their form and powers.

07:21.591 --> 07:23.108
[grunts]

07:23.185 --> 07:24.559
[scoffs] "Only," he says.

07:26.672 --> 07:27.854
[grunts, groans]

07:27.931 --> 07:29.689
[yells]

07:31.693 --> 07:32.693
[yells]

07:35.271 --> 07:37.864
[growls]
Hulk not afraid of ghosts!

07:37.941 --> 07:38.941
[yells]

07:44.539 --> 07:46.856
[grunts] Don't make Hulk mad!

07:46.858 --> 07:48.633
[yelling]

07:50.195 --> 07:52.862
Excellent.

07:52.864 --> 07:56.457
My next puppet
will be the most powerful.

07:56.535 --> 08:00.386
[Hulk thinking] No, we can't
let him get the Hulk.

08:00.463 --> 08:01.888
Gotta control the rage.

08:10.716 --> 08:14.734
Ah, nothing but a weak mortal.

08:14.811 --> 08:17.144
[grunts]

08:17.222 --> 08:18.555
[Doctor Strange] Bruce Banner?

08:18.557 --> 08:20.740
Uhh!

08:20.817 --> 08:22.909
Impressive.
I never imagined Hulk

08:22.986 --> 08:24.722
possessed that kind of self-control.
[grunts]

08:24.746 --> 08:26.153
[grunts]

08:26.231 --> 08:28.565
[panting]

08:28.567 --> 08:31.751
Okay, Merlin, let's see you
magic your way out of this!

08:31.828 --> 08:33.461
Hm.

08:36.164 --> 08:38.350
I hate magic so much!

08:38.426 --> 08:41.001
Corse Predominate!

08:41.078 --> 08:42.095
[grunts]

08:45.100 --> 08:47.850
[groaning]

08:50.513 --> 08:51.604
[body thuds]

08:51.681 --> 08:53.856
Avengers, with me!

08:59.856 --> 09:03.783
They are not to escape
with the Eye.

09:03.860 --> 09:05.210
Find them!

09:07.697 --> 09:11.457
Into my lab. We can find
some way to fight back.

09:15.781 --> 09:20.225
I've never fought anyone
as strong as Agamotto before.

09:20.302 --> 09:22.209
I cannot hope
to simply overpower him.

09:22.287 --> 09:26.714
I need time to find the magic
that will defeat Agamotto.

09:26.792 --> 09:28.124
I don't know about
all your hocus-pocus,

09:28.126 --> 09:31.886
but maybe I can come up
with a scientific solution.

09:31.963 --> 09:34.406
Man, this place is a mess.

09:34.482 --> 09:36.649
What, did, like, Hulk smash it?

09:36.726 --> 09:39.803
I have a rule with myself.
Or with him, I mean.

09:39.805 --> 09:43.915
No Hulk smash in the lab, no
matter how frustrated we get.

09:43.992 --> 09:47.310
It must take a great amount of
restraint to stand up to the Hulk.

09:47.312 --> 09:48.920
Yeah. You have no idea.

09:48.997 --> 09:52.315
True. But science
and magic are alike.

09:52.317 --> 09:56.410
We are both tasked with
controlling incredible power.

09:56.488 --> 09:58.822
Everything in the universe
has a frequency.

09:58.824 --> 10:01.174
Magic or not shouldn't matter.

10:01.250 --> 10:02.826
This energy device
should disrupt

10:02.828 --> 10:07.013
the frequency field around us,
hopefully masking the Eye.

10:07.090 --> 10:10.925
[buzzing] That is so cool!

10:11.002 --> 10:13.260
One question: Why does it
look like a monkey wrench?

10:13.338 --> 10:15.113
What? No, no.

10:15.190 --> 10:17.630
This is a sophisticated, highly
sensitive piece of technology.

10:17.692 --> 10:21.694
It doesn't look like a...
Oh, man, you're right.

10:21.771 --> 10:24.364
It looks exactly like a wrench.
Huh?

10:26.701 --> 10:28.242
They found us!

10:29.688 --> 10:31.245
[grunts]

10:42.033 --> 10:44.625
[grunts]

10:44.703 --> 10:46.293
It didn't work.

10:46.371 --> 10:50.223
I can't believe it didn't work!
[yells]

10:50.299 --> 10:53.543
Where science failed,
magic may yet triumph.

10:53.545 --> 10:55.803
This will dispel the shadows!

10:55.881 --> 10:56.896
[grunts]

11:00.977 --> 11:03.569
It didn't work?

11:03.646 --> 11:04.726
Will something please work?

11:06.241 --> 11:07.573
Aah!

11:09.227 --> 11:11.452
[grunting]

11:16.735 --> 11:18.918
[yells, grunts]

11:20.329 --> 11:21.838
[grunts]

11:24.167 --> 11:26.592
[yells]

11:26.669 --> 11:28.186
Whoo! Go, me!

11:32.434 --> 11:35.176
Corse Predominate!

11:35.253 --> 11:37.587
Aahh!

11:37.589 --> 11:39.088
[groans]

11:39.090 --> 11:40.090
No!

11:41.426 --> 11:43.535
Join the ranks

11:43.611 --> 11:46.279
of the dark, twisted shadows!

11:51.937 --> 11:55.104
Stop running and fight me,
Strange.

11:55.139 --> 11:57.382
Your power against mine.

11:57.459 --> 11:59.275
I cannot fight you head-on.

11:59.277 --> 12:03.780
A magic battle of such magnitude
would tear this world apart.

12:03.782 --> 12:06.891
No. There is always another way.

12:06.968 --> 12:09.728
By the traveling tempest
of Danaughey!

12:09.804 --> 12:10.970
No! Stop him!

12:22.317 --> 12:26.636
The Eye may be gone,
but I see what it sees.

12:26.638 --> 12:30.564
I will find Strange soon enough.

12:30.642 --> 12:34.902
[Dr. Banner] So this is where Agamotto
broke through to our reality?

12:34.980 --> 12:38.481
Yes. The barriers
between our realm

12:38.483 --> 12:40.908
and the dimensions of light
and dark are thinner here.

12:40.986 --> 12:45.079
I believe I can reopen a portal,
and we can push him back through.

12:45.156 --> 12:47.215
Let's get to work
on that equation, Doctor.

12:53.331 --> 12:56.516
You know nothing of magic.

12:56.592 --> 12:59.836
But you will learn
the meaning of power,

12:59.838 --> 13:02.104
and the meaning of my wrath!

13:07.178 --> 13:10.013
Did you really think
this place would help you?

13:10.015 --> 13:11.956
By the calamitous chains
of Kah-noo-ski!

13:13.518 --> 13:15.535
[grunting]

13:15.611 --> 13:18.445
I have the power to destroy you,

13:18.523 --> 13:20.799
and once I have the Eye,

13:20.875 --> 13:23.284
the power to destroy everything.

13:23.361 --> 13:25.028
[grunting]

13:25.030 --> 13:30.033
Bruce... Can't cast spells...
without my hands.

13:30.035 --> 13:31.309
[grunting continues]

13:31.386 --> 13:33.812
I think I can reach...
my wrench.

13:33.888 --> 13:36.389
[straining]

13:39.210 --> 13:41.102
Got it!

13:44.232 --> 13:45.314
[both] Aah!

13:47.235 --> 13:49.494
Score one for science. [Grunts]

13:49.571 --> 13:52.572
By the Winds of Watoomb!

13:57.745 --> 14:00.897
Is this the best you can do,
Doctor Strange?

14:00.899 --> 14:03.165
No wonder the Eye calls
to Agamotto!

14:05.661 --> 14:07.253
[grunts]

14:07.330 --> 14:09.163
[grunts]

14:09.240 --> 14:12.174
By the Bogs of Bardeaux!

14:13.745 --> 14:16.412
[laughing]

14:16.414 --> 14:18.247
As if you could keep
the Eye from me.

14:18.249 --> 14:23.769
I have power of the dimensions
light and dark,

14:23.846 --> 14:27.857
fueled by anger you can
never understand or defeat!

14:30.111 --> 14:31.352
[yells]

14:31.429 --> 14:33.687
[groans]

14:33.765 --> 14:36.099
[grunts] "Fueled by anger"?

14:36.101 --> 14:40.786
Well, perhaps I've been
going about this all wrong.

14:40.863 --> 14:42.714
By the Mists of Munnopor!

14:46.444 --> 14:50.537
You have anything stronger than
mists or winds of Munn-whatever?

14:50.615 --> 14:54.559
It's not science or magic
that wins this fight, Bruce.

14:54.636 --> 14:57.511
It's willpower.
Come on. I have a plan.

15:04.646 --> 15:06.979
You can't run from me.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.065
By the Flames of the Faltine!

15:18.143 --> 15:19.584
[grunts]

15:19.661 --> 15:22.578
Infuriating gnat!

15:23.848 --> 15:25.706
[grunts, groans]

15:28.653 --> 15:30.911
[grunts] [grunts]

15:30.989 --> 15:34.157
[grunts] [groaning]

15:34.159 --> 15:36.750
For the last time,
give me the Eye!

15:36.828 --> 15:37.828
[grunts] [groans]

15:39.497 --> 15:41.088
[grunts]

15:41.166 --> 15:44.000
You are mistaken, Agamotto.

15:44.002 --> 15:46.335
The Eye is no longer
mine to give.

15:46.337 --> 15:48.187
What?

15:48.264 --> 15:51.190
The Eye! Where is it?

15:51.267 --> 15:54.193
I am so close
to power incarnate.

15:54.270 --> 15:59.440
You and your heroes can never
defeat me and my anger!

15:59.517 --> 16:01.775
[chuckles]

16:01.853 --> 16:03.369
I know someone angrier than you.

16:03.446 --> 16:04.446
[grunts]

16:07.859 --> 16:09.375
[growls]

16:09.452 --> 16:11.377
[growls]

16:11.454 --> 16:13.879
[growling]

16:13.956 --> 16:15.974
Hulk magic smash!

16:16.050 --> 16:18.034
[roaring]

16:18.036 --> 16:20.461
[grunts, groans]

16:20.538 --> 16:22.796
Doc, do your thing!

16:22.874 --> 16:26.484
Hulk gonna teach old wizard new
magic tricks. [Knuckles cracking]

16:26.561 --> 16:29.045
You? Well, it doesn't matter

16:29.047 --> 16:30.730
whose body I take the Eye from.

16:35.811 --> 16:38.329
[roars]

16:40.074 --> 16:41.499
[roars]

16:43.578 --> 16:44.578
[grunts]

16:45.730 --> 16:48.330
[yells, growls]

16:50.826 --> 16:52.084
[grunting] [groans]

16:52.161 --> 16:53.903
[grunting]

16:53.905 --> 16:58.574
You will pay for that,
you cursed ogre!

16:58.576 --> 17:00.259
[both grunt]

17:00.336 --> 17:01.336
[groans]

17:03.431 --> 17:06.140
[roars] [grunts, groans]

17:11.422 --> 17:14.348
Hulk use magic
to smash magic man!

17:14.425 --> 17:16.534
[roars] [grunts]

17:16.611 --> 17:18.277
[grunting]

17:20.431 --> 17:21.446
[yells] [grunts]

17:21.523 --> 17:23.040
[grunting]

17:25.936 --> 17:27.453
[groans]

17:29.791 --> 17:31.791
[grunts]

17:31.867 --> 17:34.794
But how could one like him...

17:34.870 --> 17:37.388
No blundering ogre
will defeat me!

17:40.968 --> 17:42.376
[yells]

17:42.453 --> 17:44.678
[groaning]

17:46.641 --> 17:48.307
[grunts]

17:48.384 --> 17:50.643
[grunts]

17:50.719 --> 17:52.520
[grunting]

17:58.152 --> 18:00.078
Impossible.

18:01.656 --> 18:03.989
Oh, it's possible.

18:04.066 --> 18:05.975
[grunts]

18:05.977 --> 18:08.144
[grunting]

18:08.146 --> 18:09.754
[groans]

18:13.818 --> 18:15.209
Hulk, the barriers
have weakened.

18:17.839 --> 18:21.841
I am... Agamotto!

18:21.917 --> 18:23.768
I am Hulk!

18:26.755 --> 18:29.756
[groans]

18:29.834 --> 18:31.517
[grunts weakly]

18:31.594 --> 18:33.853
[grunts]

18:33.929 --> 18:37.506
Oh, come on! [Growls]

18:37.508 --> 18:39.692
Right hand
a little higher, Hulk.

18:39.768 --> 18:40.934
Point the index finger.

18:41.012 --> 18:43.028
Hm.

18:45.183 --> 18:46.574
[groans]

18:48.611 --> 18:52.279
Puny wizard doesn't have
the magic Eye.

18:52.357 --> 18:54.373
Only Hulk has the magic!

18:54.450 --> 18:55.791
[knuckles crack] [grunts]

18:57.528 --> 19:00.863
[grunts, groans]

19:00.865 --> 19:03.465
Hulk, now! The doorway is ready!

19:09.056 --> 19:10.598
Magic hands harder
than it looks.

19:16.305 --> 19:17.305
[grunts]

19:21.068 --> 19:23.903
By the green fists of smash!

19:23.979 --> 19:25.070
[yells] [grunts]

19:25.147 --> 19:27.907
[screaming]

19:27.983 --> 19:29.283
[straining]

19:33.656 --> 19:35.731
[grunting]

19:35.733 --> 19:37.833
Well, bye. [Grunts]

19:39.237 --> 19:41.828
Nooo!

19:41.906 --> 19:44.298
[distorted screaming]

20:15.773 --> 20:18.216
Here you go, Doc. Good as new.

20:19.777 --> 20:21.552
[chuckles]

20:21.629 --> 20:23.170
[chuckles]

20:30.121 --> 20:33.956
Agamotto's portal to our dimension
sank to the bottom of the ocean,

20:33.958 --> 20:36.809
so he must be gone for good.

20:36.885 --> 20:40.796
Well, hey, us not being evil shadow
creatures is proof of that, right?

20:40.798 --> 20:44.408
So, who's gonna tell Hulk how
much the final damage total is?

20:44.485 --> 20:47.060
Leave those to me.
The nation of Wakanda

20:47.138 --> 20:48.988
will cover the Avengers' bills.

20:49.064 --> 20:51.474
Besides, from what I heard,

20:51.476 --> 20:53.659
those talking teddy bears
had it coming.

20:53.736 --> 20:54.919
[laughing]

20:57.815 --> 20:59.648
Who would've imagined
that Dr. Banner

20:59.650 --> 21:02.167
and Doctor Strange
would make such a great team?

21:02.244 --> 21:05.504
Hulk and Doctor Strange
make a good team too.

21:05.581 --> 21:07.414
Thanks for teaching me
a little magic.

21:07.492 --> 21:09.675
All I did was demonstrate.

21:09.752 --> 21:11.918
You were the one who learned
to respect magic.

21:11.996 --> 21:15.164
Hmm. Well,
now I'm gonna teach you

21:15.166 --> 21:16.932
how to respect smash.

21:19.261 --> 21:22.763
My hands aren't really good
for that sort of thing.

21:22.840 --> 21:25.508
I wouldn't even
know how to... smash.

21:25.510 --> 21:27.768
Just get angry
and do what comes next.

21:27.845 --> 21:30.012
[both grunt]

21:30.014 --> 21:38.014
[both] Smash!
