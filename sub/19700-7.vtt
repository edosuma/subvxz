WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:05.173
(electricity crackling)

00:05.206 --> 00:06.574
ANNOUNCER: Fargo.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.709
All new Wednesdays at 10:00.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.744
On FX.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.148
ANNOUNCER: FX presents

00:14.182 --> 00:16.184
Feud: Bette and Joan.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.091
*

00:27.361 --> 00:30.331
JOAN (as Miriam):
They say places
you knew as a child

00:30.364 --> 00:33.067
seem smaller
when you see them again.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.605
It's not true.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.408
It's just as I left it.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.064
Keep the change.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.136
ROBERT:
Cut.
(bell rings)

01:08.169 --> 01:11.272
Beautiful. Ladies and gentlemen,

01:11.305 --> 01:13.707
Miss Joan Crawford,
our one-take wonder.
(chuckles)

01:13.741 --> 01:15.443
(applause)

01:15.476 --> 01:17.545
Okay, next set up.
Wait, Bob,

01:17.578 --> 01:18.879
don't you want me
to try it again?

01:18.912 --> 01:20.080
No need, Joanie. You nailed it.

01:20.114 --> 01:23.484
Are you sure?
Absolutely.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.986
Well done.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.458
(both laugh)

01:30.491 --> 01:31.625
(sighs)

01:31.659 --> 01:33.127
There's nothing as exciting

01:33.161 --> 01:34.962
as the first day on a set,
is there?

01:34.995 --> 01:37.598
It's my fifth day, but sure.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.033
(Robert and Bette laugh)

01:42.370 --> 01:45.239
JOAN:
They're like bunny rabbits.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.275
It's past midnight.
They've been at it

01:47.308 --> 01:49.177
since we got home from dinner.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.479
Miss Joan, you have
an early call tomorrow.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.281
You must rest.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.582
Well, how can I sleep

01:54.615 --> 01:56.350
when my director and co-star

01:56.384 --> 01:58.986
are engaged in some
tawdry bacchanal

01:59.019 --> 02:00.154
30 feet away?

02:00.188 --> 02:01.355
Have a nightcap.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.756
I told you, Mamacita,

02:02.790 --> 02:04.158
I am not drinking
on this production.

02:04.192 --> 02:06.360
I need a clear head.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.629
I could sing a lullaby.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.632
I'll call the front desk.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.367
Go to sleep, Mamacita.

02:13.401 --> 02:16.304
I don't care
what they do in private,

02:16.337 --> 02:19.207
but staying up
partying like teenagers

02:19.240 --> 02:21.542
can only detract from
the quality of their work

02:21.575 --> 02:23.611
and, by extension, mine.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.379
And that I cannot abide.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.614
No, no, no, no.

02:26.647 --> 02:30.351
I'll simply go over
there and politely ask

02:30.384 --> 02:32.953
them to consider the
labors that lie ahead

02:32.986 --> 02:36.357
and encourage them to make
more responsible choices.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.160
Should I wait up?

02:40.194 --> 02:42.129
(rock music playing)
VICTOR:
Oh!

02:42.162 --> 02:45.999
AGNES: Oh, my, my, Bette.
Oh, you've caused a terrible...

02:46.033 --> 02:47.301
BETTE:
Ready? This is the one.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.502
VICTOR:
Yeah. Okay.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.638
BETTE:
This is it. Here we go.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.072
(laughter)

02:54.375 --> 02:55.609
VICTOR:
Oh!

02:58.045 --> 03:01.415
BETTE:
And keep the change.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.683
ALL:
Oh!

03:02.716 --> 03:03.917
(laughter)

03:03.951 --> 03:06.354
VICTOR:
Take it.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.522
BETTE: Stop teasing me.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.594
(Victor laughs)

03:13.627 --> 03:15.028
BETTE:
Ow. Damn it.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.330
Give it up, Bette.

03:16.364 --> 03:17.598
You're never gonna
be able to do it.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.867
I don't know how she managed
to do all that business

03:19.900 --> 03:22.102
in one take.
Oh, my goodness.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.004
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you admire her.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.839
JOSEPH: Well, why shouldn't
she? It's no accident

03:25.873 --> 03:27.675
Joan's been a star
since the silents.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.076
She's an artist.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.844
Between the sheets.
VICTOR:
Oh!

03:30.878 --> 03:32.212
My, my, Bette.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.615
I thought your rivalry
was put on for the press.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.884
I don't know what you're talking
about. What rivalry?

03:36.917 --> 03:38.519
I got to hand it to you, Bette.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.887
After all you've been through,

03:39.920 --> 03:42.089
giving Joan the Oscar bait
this go-around?

03:42.122 --> 03:43.424
It's mighty white of you.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.858
The picture is called

03:44.892 --> 03:46.394
Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.228
AGNES:
There you go.
I play Charlotte.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.698
Oh, well, then,
let me congratulate you

03:50.731 --> 03:53.934
on your divine work
in All About Margo Channing.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.469
(laughs)
VICTOR: Joan's
playing the villain,

03:55.503 --> 03:58.038
and villains always
have the meatier roles.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.407
She's the mastermind.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.808
JOSEPH:
That's true.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.876
AGNES: You guys,
stop teasing her now.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.278
JOSEPH:
Nobody's teasing anyone.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.713
Agnes, shouldn't you
be giving me your...

04:05.746 --> 04:07.948
AGNES: Sweetheart,
it's fabulous.

04:10.518 --> 04:13.253
*

04:44.518 --> 04:47.521
*

05:13.681 --> 05:16.417
(seagulls chirping,
waves crashing)

05:36.370 --> 05:39.339
*

05:44.111 --> 05:45.679
I hope you had a good breakfast.

05:47.381 --> 05:50.217
I do wish you'd give me a
crack at those brows, Joan.

05:50.250 --> 05:53.387
The brows are mine.
And the mouth.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.623
Let's get started on the lashes.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.128
No.

06:04.865 --> 06:05.933
No.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.408
Yes.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.650
I'll just take...
Mmm! Don't.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.088
JOAN:
"Why wouldn't I

06:28.121 --> 06:30.357
"tell him that his...

06:30.390 --> 06:32.860
"his pure, darling little girl

06:32.893 --> 06:36.396
was having a dirty little affair
with a married man?"

06:36.430 --> 06:39.266
MAMACITA: "You're a vile,
sorry little bitch."

06:42.570 --> 06:44.104
Freshen me up, Mamacita.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.875
BETTE (Southern accent):
Well, God bless your heart.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.142
Here's Cousin Miriam

06:49.176 --> 06:52.312
all dolled up from
tip-top to her toenails.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.914
Welcome.
(chuckles)

06:53.947 --> 06:55.649
Well, I wanted to make sure

06:55.683 --> 06:57.985
that my look would survive
the humidity.

06:58.018 --> 07:01.288
I didn't realize you were
in this scene, Bette.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.956
I'm not.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.559
JOSEPH:
Often at night,

07:05.593 --> 07:07.761
she sits up, dressed...

07:07.795 --> 07:09.930
as if she was still young,

07:09.963 --> 07:11.799
expecting a beau.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.467
I seem to remember

07:13.501 --> 07:16.203
once expecting
something like that myself.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.774
You gonna be all right here?

07:20.808 --> 07:22.409
I could stay over.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.911
You've been content

07:23.944 --> 07:25.613
to let me get by on my own
all these years.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.247
Another night won't kill me.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.617
You're not gonna let her do it
that way, are you?
Cut.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.752
(bell rings)

07:31.785 --> 07:33.521
What? What happened?
Nothing. Nothing.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.155
We'll get... We're gonna go
again straightaway, Joanie.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.290
Maybe you don't even need this
scene. I mean, it seems like

07:37.324 --> 07:38.859
it might not be necessary.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.328
You have something to say
about my performance?

07:41.361 --> 07:43.030
Then say it to me.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.364
All right.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.199
This scene isn't
really necessary,

07:46.233 --> 07:48.536
and you're telegraphing
that Miriam is up to no good

07:48.569 --> 07:49.837
when the audience,
at this point,

07:49.870 --> 07:51.038
has to think she's a saint.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.941
This is my performance.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.009
I have worked very hard

07:56.043 --> 07:57.778
on this.
Joan, can we just
shoot the scene?

07:57.811 --> 08:00.013
Let's worry about cutting
and changing later on.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.348
Can you do it this time

08:01.381 --> 08:02.983
as if butter wouldn't
melt in your mouth.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.151
Good idea.
Okay.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.819
Reset.

08:08.221 --> 08:12.025
I need to process
your note, Bob.

08:12.059 --> 08:15.062
In my trailer.

08:20.367 --> 08:23.003
JOAN:
What the hell is she
doing on this set

08:23.036 --> 08:24.404
during my scene?
Running off at the mouth

08:24.437 --> 08:25.906
about my performance?

08:25.939 --> 08:27.908
And you, you just sitting there

08:27.941 --> 08:29.309
like a wet dog.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.178
Where the hell are your balls?

08:31.211 --> 08:32.379
Bette can say
whatever she wants.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.914
She's a producer.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.216
What?

08:36.249 --> 08:38.652
I made her associate producer.
It was the only way

08:38.686 --> 08:41.088
to get her to sign on. She was
holding the picture hostage.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.255
No, I don't want that!

08:42.289 --> 08:43.657
Goddamn it.

08:43.691 --> 08:44.925
Go on, Mamacita.

08:44.958 --> 08:45.893
Leave us alone.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.095
You made her a producer?

08:48.128 --> 08:49.496
Joanie, the title's meaningless.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.065
Bette just needs to feel
she has authority.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.267
I have been working
day and night

08:54.301 --> 08:56.003
to prepare for this role.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.205
Nothing's changed.
You're still gonna be great.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.007
You have no idea how much harder

09:00.040 --> 09:03.076
I have to work to be
taken seriously as an actress.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.277
I didn't get my start

09:04.311 --> 09:07.514
in the theater,
like Miss Bette Davis.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.550
I broke in shaking my fringe
in nightclubs.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.586
I'd come home after a gig

09:12.620 --> 09:14.187
with scotch on my dress,

09:14.221 --> 09:16.757
and I'll always have
that stain on me

09:16.790 --> 09:19.960
and I'll always have to prove
them wrong, and I can't...

09:19.993 --> 09:22.796
do it on Charlotte

09:22.830 --> 09:25.132
because she won't let me.
Joanie, you have to let go

09:25.165 --> 09:27.534
of that anger to her.
You can't give her the fight.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.469
I am not angry with her!

09:29.502 --> 09:31.304
I'm angry with you.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.974
God, I must have
been such a fool,

09:34.007 --> 09:37.611
thinking that you were paying me
this great tribute

09:37.645 --> 09:39.747
by promising me
top billing.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.048
And all the while,

09:41.081 --> 09:43.150
behind my back,
you were promising her

09:43.183 --> 09:46.887
exactly what she deserved:
producer.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.188
Well, Bob...

09:49.757 --> 09:53.393
...do you think
I deserve it, too?

09:53.426 --> 09:56.730
Joanie,
don't put me on the spot.

09:56.764 --> 10:01.334
You know what I'm
going to enjoy?

10:01.368 --> 10:04.972
I'm going to enjoy
watching you learn

10:05.005 --> 10:07.741
just how meaningless

10:07.775 --> 10:11.812
Bette thinks this title is.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.847
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

10:21.221 --> 10:22.622
Where's Joan?

10:22.656 --> 10:25.659
Oh, she's out
catching groundhogs.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.160
To replenish her wig supply.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.629
You have to catch them
in the dead of night.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.865
Why do you keep saying that?

10:31.899 --> 10:33.333
It's not nice.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.135
It's hard for a woman.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.104
Losing her hair.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.471
Her femin-in...

10:38.505 --> 10:39.773
Femin-in-inity.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.342
(laughs)
You should be nice.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.211
It's a joke, Victor.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.679
Oh, my God.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.380
Stop drinking. It's
making you soft.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.149
Oh, you should have seen

10:49.182 --> 10:52.285
how the most beautiful woman
that ever lived

10:52.319 --> 10:54.521
treated me back in the day.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.489
And I remember
thinking then,

10:56.523 --> 10:59.492
"Beauty fades.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.294
Just wait."

11:01.328 --> 11:02.896
And it did.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.998
Well, I remember seeing her
in Humoresque.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.200
Shunned by John Garfield,

11:07.234 --> 11:09.202
marching into the ocean,

11:09.236 --> 11:12.139
every hair in place.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.042
Beauty, dignity and death,

11:15.075 --> 11:18.311
all in one exquisite pose.

11:18.345 --> 11:22.149
She marched into the
sea to her death...

11:22.182 --> 11:25.585
(chuckles) ...and never
got her hair wet.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.620
Well...

11:30.523 --> 11:32.525
It meant a lot to me.

11:39.066 --> 11:42.035
ROBERT:
Turndown service, Miss Davis?

11:42.069 --> 11:44.772
I wish I had known
for a single day

11:44.805 --> 11:48.175
what it feels like
to walk into a room

11:48.208 --> 11:52.212
and knock them out
without a single word.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.047
Bette, you don't
even know yourself.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.548
You've been too long
in this business.

11:55.582 --> 11:56.917
Oh, you have no
idea what it's like

11:56.950 --> 11:58.185
to be a woman
in this business,

11:58.218 --> 11:59.787
with the constant scrutiny

11:59.820 --> 12:01.388
and competition.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.556
Ah, do we have to go through
this melodrama right now?

12:03.590 --> 12:04.958
Fuck you, Bob.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.726
All right, tell me.
Then tell me.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.429
No. You tell me,
Mr. Director Man.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.398
Have you ever
been rebuffed

12:11.431 --> 12:13.300
by a woman because
of how you look?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.768
I'm betting no.

12:14.802 --> 12:17.437
I'm guessing that your
success was enough,

12:17.470 --> 12:19.606
that they fucked you
despite your beer gut

12:19.639 --> 12:21.141
and your middle-age sag.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.242
(laughing):
Am I right?

12:22.275 --> 12:24.477
(chuckles)
I don't make up the rules.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.814
(laughs)

12:26.847 --> 12:31.584
My first screen test
with Jack Warner,

12:31.618 --> 12:32.920
I stuck around and
I hid behind a door

12:32.953 --> 12:35.055
because I wanted
to hear his reaction.

12:35.088 --> 12:39.092
Did he see my talent,
my humor, my intelligence,

12:39.126 --> 12:43.096
my brave attack on the scene?

12:43.130 --> 12:44.464
But he wasn't interested
in any of that.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.899
Guess what he said.
What did he say?

12:45.933 --> 12:48.468
He said I had
zero sex appeal.

12:48.501 --> 12:52.372
He said, "Who would
want to fuck that?"

12:55.708 --> 12:57.777
I was 22.

12:57.811 --> 13:01.714
And nobody ever had.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.624
You should go to bed.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.975
(Bette laughs)

13:29.910 --> 13:33.881
(laughing):
Guess who he said he
wished I looked like?

13:35.883 --> 13:38.051
Joan Crawford.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.926
*

13:56.203 --> 14:00.007
Why wouldn't I tell him that
his pure, darling little girl

14:00.040 --> 14:03.243
was having a dirty little affair
with a married man?

14:03.276 --> 14:05.913
You vile, sorry little bitch.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.248
How did I know it was going
to end in murder

14:08.281 --> 14:09.816
with John being butchered?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.752
Cut. Fantastic,
Joanie, fantastic.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.021
Okay, turning
around on Bette.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.423
You all right?

14:16.456 --> 14:19.492
No. I'm fine.
It's just so hot.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.161
Yeah. It's a little different
down here

14:21.194 --> 14:23.096
than the freezing cold
soundstage.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.999
Bob. Bob. Where do you want me

14:26.033 --> 14:28.101
for Bette's off-camera?
BETTE: You know,
I don't think I need you.

14:28.135 --> 14:31.004
It's tight. I can have the
script girl give me your lines.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.940
But it's our scene.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.541
I mean, don't you want me here

14:34.574 --> 14:36.343
to give you something
to build on?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.911
You already have.
Why don't you find

14:37.945 --> 14:40.080
a dark air-conditioned spot
and lie down?

14:40.113 --> 14:41.581
(equipment thuds)

15:11.278 --> 15:14.014
(gasps, exhales)

15:23.823 --> 15:25.825
Ooh.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.372
(groans)

15:59.526 --> 16:01.528
*

16:03.396 --> 16:05.398
(insects trilling)

16:23.683 --> 16:25.685
Hello?

16:31.224 --> 16:34.094
Hello!

16:37.264 --> 16:38.831
Lucille.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.467
This entire production

16:40.500 --> 16:42.035
is an elaborate opportunity

16:42.069 --> 16:43.570
for you to humiliate
me, isn't it?

16:43.603 --> 16:45.472
What are you talking about?
You, Bob,

16:45.505 --> 16:48.075
the whole fucking
crew abandoned me

16:48.108 --> 16:49.876
out at that plantation.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.544
Mamacita had to find

16:51.578 --> 16:54.081
a phone and call a city cab
Jesus, Joan.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.482
to bring us back.
I had no idea.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.550
No, I don't believe you.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.187
The proclaimed alliance
back in Los Angeles,

17:00.220 --> 17:03.323
you never had any intention
of honoring.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.491
That is not true.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.892
Christ, what a fool I was

17:05.925 --> 17:07.694
to sign up for this picture.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.430
And a bigger fool to think
I could ever trust you.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.065
I need you to be brilliant.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.666
I'm just trying
to help you get there.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.768
Oh, you're giving me a hand up?

17:15.802 --> 17:18.738
Because you're
the superior talent.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.407
Well, I don't
want your help.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.509
You've always been overrated.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.011
I guess that explains
my 11 Oscar nominations.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.014
The Academy doesn't reward you
for your talent,

17:28.047 --> 17:29.516
for Christ's sakes, Bette.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.351
They reward you

17:31.384 --> 17:33.520
because they see
how hard you sweat.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.888
They don't see the character,
they see the acting.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.257
And they don't see you at all

17:37.290 --> 17:39.192
because of all your
glamour makeup.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.894
Well, let me give you a tip.

17:41.928 --> 17:44.097
The answer to feeling
unattractive

17:44.131 --> 17:46.599
isn't to make yourself
even uglier.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.105
(thunder rumbles in distance)

17:56.509 --> 17:58.511
I'm a character actress.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.817
Well, I said what I came to say.

18:04.851 --> 18:08.221
I'm going to bed.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.290
Joan.

18:16.929 --> 18:21.334
How did it feel to be the most
beautiful girl in the world?

18:27.174 --> 18:30.810
It was wonderful.

18:30.843 --> 18:34.681
The most joyous thing
you could ever imagine.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.716
And it was never enough.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.589
Well, what about you?

18:42.622 --> 18:47.194
How did it feel to be the most
talented girl in the world?

18:50.129 --> 18:53.600
Great.

18:53.633 --> 18:57.470
And it was never enough.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.745
(thunder crashes in distance)

19:14.654 --> 19:15.688
From Mr. Aldrich.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.691
Oh, thank you, driver.

19:18.725 --> 19:22.495
Well, at least he remembered
to send a car this time.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.896
Maybe now that we
are back in Los Angeles

19:23.930 --> 19:25.298
things will go more smooth.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.166
Call sheet for Monday.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.868
Let me see.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.904
Report to 20th Century Fox,

19:31.938 --> 19:34.341
stage seven,

19:34.374 --> 19:37.310
scene 42, 6:00 a.m.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.346
Scene 42.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.882
Oh, that's my scene
with Mr. Cotten.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.852
The seduction scene,
it's a wonderful scene.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.721
And Bette's not in it.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.990
What's this?

19:51.023 --> 19:53.260
Script revisions?

19:53.293 --> 19:56.396
For what?

19:56.429 --> 19:59.432
Where is my monologue?

20:01.100 --> 20:04.537
What? It's all been cut.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.373
This is her doing.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.875
And Bob is
colluding with her.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.042
That's why he
sent the car.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.278
To soften the blow.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.345
Driver.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.113
I'm not going to Brentwood.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.616
Take me to
Cedars-Sinai Hospital.

20:16.649 --> 20:20.052
I'm suddenly feeling
very, very ill.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.090
Well, according to her doctors,

20:24.123 --> 20:25.458
it's respiratory.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.693
Respiratory?

20:26.726 --> 20:27.927
What a load of shit.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.429
She's faking it.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.230
She's mad because we trimmed
a few of her lines,

20:31.264 --> 20:32.599
so she's holding up production.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.033
I used to play the same tricks

20:34.066 --> 20:35.768
when I was at Warner's
under contract.

20:35.802 --> 20:37.404
We can't let her
get away with it.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.306
Mother, Jeremy and I
need to speak to you.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.807
Say hello to Mr. Aldrich, B.D.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.142
Yeah. Hello, Mr. Aldrich.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.278
And this is her elderly
playmate, Jerome.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.913
It's Jeremy, actually.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.715
He's got an accent.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.583
What is it, B.D.?

20:50.617 --> 20:52.251
I'm managing a crisis.

20:52.285 --> 20:53.953
Your whole life
is managing a crisis.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.722
I just need you to sign
these consent forms.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.156
Consent for what?

20:57.189 --> 20:58.958
For Jeremy and I
to get married.

20:58.991 --> 21:02.094
Don't be ridiculous;
you're 16 years old.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.830
And wise quite
beyond her years.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.598
And that's a credit
to you as a mother.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.634
Ah, don't sweet-talk me, bub.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.402
That English accent might
thrill the little girls,

21:09.436 --> 21:10.737
but it does nothing for me.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.939
I played
Elizabeth I, twice.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.907
You're not marrying
a 40-year-old man.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.809
I'm 29, actually.
You're twice her age.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.278
Old enough to give your daughter
everything she deserves.

21:19.312 --> 21:22.349
Protection, affection
and financial stability.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.351
I give her all that.

21:24.384 --> 21:25.952
We're in love, Mother.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.487
And we're getting married,

21:27.520 --> 21:29.088
whether it's now
or two years from now

21:29.121 --> 21:30.823
when we won't need
your permission.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.159
You don't want my permission,
you want my attention.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.928
Now you have it,
and the answer is no.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.930
Fine! Force your daughter
into a life of sin,

21:37.964 --> 21:39.699
if that's what you want.
It is what I want.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.701
In fact, march yourself
up those stairs

21:41.734 --> 21:44.637
to my bedroom and grab my copy
of The Feminine Mystique,

21:44.671 --> 21:47.006
and read it
before you ruin your life.

21:47.039 --> 21:49.542
What life?
I have no life.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.210
Come on, Jeremy.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.312
A pleasure
to have met you.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.214
Christ. I thought
we had reached

21:55.247 --> 21:57.350
some kind of dГ©tente,
but it's always a battle.

21:57.384 --> 22:00.387
But she's not going to
win, not this time, Bob.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.221
Jesus, Bette.

22:02.254 --> 22:04.457
It's not a competition,
she's your daughter.

22:04.491 --> 22:07.494
No. I meant Crawford.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.629
She's not going to
shut down production.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.665
Not for one single day.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.703
HEDDA: Dateline:
Hollywood, California.

22:16.736 --> 22:20.373
Production on 20th Century
Fox's lavish Gothic drama

22:20.407 --> 22:23.810
Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte,
continues despite rumblings

22:23.843 --> 22:27.480
that the back of a stand-in
is doing the work of a star.

22:27.514 --> 22:28.815
DIRECTOR:
Action!

22:28.848 --> 22:30.983
Miriam?

22:31.017 --> 22:33.720
(chuckling):
I just can't believe it.

22:33.753 --> 22:36.088
You look marvelous.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.591
What is it
you can't believe, Drew?

22:38.625 --> 22:41.260
That I'm here or that
I look the way I do?

22:41.293 --> 22:42.862
Ah, come on, Miriam.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.864
Don't make fun
of an old man.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.433
DIRECTOR:
Cut!

22:46.466 --> 22:48.435
HEDDA: Whispers of
a production shutdown

22:48.468 --> 22:50.903
have been dogging the project
in recent weeks.

22:50.937 --> 22:54.607
And not far away, one of the
picture's stars, Joan Crawford,

22:54.641 --> 22:58.411
recovers from what her doctors
are calling a mystery ailment.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.046
Insiders say that Joan

23:00.079 --> 23:02.949
may just have a bad case
of the B.D.s,

23:02.982 --> 23:05.051
as in Bette Davis.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.686
Rumors are
that Bette's new role

23:06.719 --> 23:08.354
as a producer on the picture

23:08.387 --> 23:10.890
have made her even more
demanding than ever.

23:10.923 --> 23:13.593
And after a string
of lackluster follow-ups

23:13.626 --> 23:15.795
to the triumph of Baby Jane,

23:15.828 --> 23:18.064
Bette really needs
this one to work.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.932
Nobody should be praying harder

23:19.966 --> 23:23.102
for Joan's speedy recovery
than Bette Davis.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.104
JOAN:
Hedda, darling,

23:25.137 --> 23:27.039
tell your readers this:

23:27.073 --> 23:29.809
I am bedded here
with the script, making notes

23:29.842 --> 23:33.145
and coming up with
all sorts of wonderful ideas

23:33.179 --> 23:34.747
for improvements.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.784
And, as a result
of my convalescence,

23:37.817 --> 23:41.053
Charlotte is sure to be
a much better picture

23:41.087 --> 23:43.856
once I recover.

23:49.361 --> 23:52.164
* I don't tell you what to say *

23:52.198 --> 23:55.602
* I don't tell you what to do *
(door opens)

23:55.635 --> 23:59.572
Well, Bob,
what a lovely surprise.

23:59.606 --> 24:00.773
Mamacita, turn that off.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.075
* That's all I ask... *

24:03.109 --> 24:06.345
Uh, c-could you give us
a few moments, please?

24:08.548 --> 24:12.018
Seeing you is a tonic.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.420
Has it really been 12 days?
(door closes)

24:14.453 --> 24:16.455
I would have come sooner,
Joanie, but...

24:16.489 --> 24:19.125
I've been busy trying
to keep a train on track.

24:19.158 --> 24:22.361
Well, I'm touched
you could find a spare moment.

24:22.394 --> 24:24.931
I have nothing
but spare moments.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.800
I've run out of material
to shoot.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.469
If I don't roll cameras on you
tomorrow morning,

24:30.503 --> 24:33.439
the studio's threatening
to close us down.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.441
I need you to come back
to work, Joanie.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.476
Bob, you know that's all I want.

24:37.510 --> 24:38.945
Great.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.179
Now, Bette's agreed
to behave herself.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.649
So, tomorrow:
7:00 a.m. on set.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.685
Otherwise the show's off.

24:45.718 --> 24:47.153
Or is that what you want?

24:47.186 --> 24:49.622
Perhaps now would be a good time

24:49.656 --> 24:52.892
to discuss some of my thoughts
about the script.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.827
I've given it a
very close read

24:54.861 --> 24:57.296
and I have a few
suggestions that I think

24:57.329 --> 24:58.965
could make all the difference.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.734
First of all, Bob,

25:01.768 --> 25:04.971
we know so little
about Miriam.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.808
Wouldn't it be wonderful to see
her in the bloom of her youth?

25:08.841 --> 25:10.509
Is it really believable

25:10.543 --> 25:13.412
that Miriam has only one suitor?

25:13.445 --> 25:15.682
Shouldn't she have more beaus?

25:15.715 --> 25:17.216
How many more beaus?

25:17.249 --> 25:18.484
Two.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.653
A politician and an attorney.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.689
And, really,

25:22.722 --> 25:25.057
her entrance into the picture?

25:25.091 --> 25:27.259
Oh, it's all wrong.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.261
A taxi cab, Bob? No.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.230
Well, how about a flying carpet?

25:31.263 --> 25:32.565
(laughs)

25:32.599 --> 25:34.000
Oh, Bob.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.535
No, but it is the South.

25:36.569 --> 25:39.171
She should be greeted back home

25:39.205 --> 25:41.674
with a big Southern ball.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.776
I mean, just think
of the production value.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.011
Think of the money.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.012
But, of course,

25:46.045 --> 25:47.747
I'm not a producer.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.749
I'm only an actress.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.718
But it would be
money well spent.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.085
Charlotte's a recluse.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.553
She wouldn't be hosting a ball

25:54.587 --> 25:55.722
in a decaying mansion.

25:55.755 --> 25:58.224
I'm not suggesting she host it.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.926
She can be there, of course.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.094
In a corner, hidden.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.864
Under the stairs, watching.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.999
All we see are her big eyes.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.137
You know, Joan,

26:11.170 --> 26:13.906
the last time I let an actor
call all the shots,

26:13.940 --> 26:15.474
I made 4 for Texas.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.910
I can't afford
another bomb.

26:17.944 --> 26:21.447
If Charlotte doesn't work,
I'm back making crap TV.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.483
So I suggest you put down
your fucking script

26:24.516 --> 26:26.318
and pick up
your fucking contract

26:26.352 --> 26:29.121
and give that
a close fucking read.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.925
Tomorrow morning,
7:00 a.m.,

26:32.959 --> 26:35.795
and not a minute later.

26:35.828 --> 26:37.529
(door slams)

26:43.836 --> 26:45.071
(indistinct conversations)

26:45.104 --> 26:46.839
Oh, Jake, how great to see you.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.140
Thank you.

26:48.174 --> 26:51.477
Oh, Sonny,
nice to see you again.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.145
Christ on a crutch.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.747
(applause)

26:54.781 --> 26:56.849
She thinks we're still
doing the last picture.

26:56.883 --> 26:58.818
Oh!

26:58.851 --> 27:00.452
This is good here, dear.

27:00.486 --> 27:02.488
Oh, yes, thank you.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.530
Oh, thank you,
thank you all so much.

27:11.563 --> 27:14.100
I can't tell you what it means
to me to be back here.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.502
I guess this old workhorse
is only really happy

27:16.535 --> 27:18.470
when she's out in the field.

27:18.504 --> 27:21.040
(laughter)

27:30.249 --> 27:33.019
Welcome back, Lucille.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.054
I removed the thorns.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.692
ROBERT:
And... action.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.127
Oh, come on, Miriam.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.030
Don't make fun of an old man.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.833
You know I never was any good
at expressin' myself.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.835
Well, that's not
so at all, Drew.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.137
You were always very quick
with your compliments.

27:51.170 --> 27:55.074
It was your intentions that
sometimes were a little vague.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.009
We used to slide
down this banister,

27:57.043 --> 27:58.845
the three of us,
and I was

27:58.878 --> 28:00.346
always the champion.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.714
Oh, we just
let you win

28:01.748 --> 28:03.249
'cause you were
the youngest.

28:03.282 --> 28:04.817
Stop it.
Cut.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.086
(bell rings)
What?

28:07.119 --> 28:09.055
I'm sorry, it's too long.
I mean, she's here

28:09.088 --> 28:11.090
to see Charlotte,
she should just get on with it.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.759
No, I have
another page of dialogue

28:12.792 --> 28:14.160
with Mr. Cotten.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.962
Yes, we should cut that.

28:17.629 --> 28:20.532
(gasps)
You okay, Joan?

28:20.566 --> 28:23.335
No, I just felt a little
dizzy, I'm sorry. I...

28:23.369 --> 28:27.206
I had a rather light breakfast.

28:29.075 --> 28:31.643
Oh...

28:33.212 --> 28:35.214
I can't breathe.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.722
I can't believe you
let her get away with it.

28:43.756 --> 28:45.591
You know I was right
about the scene.

28:45.624 --> 28:47.927
You know what, Bette?
Being right doesn't mean shit

28:47.960 --> 28:49.728
if you're driving
talent off the stage.

28:49.762 --> 28:52.731
You want to be a producer?
Well, a producer gets results.

28:52.765 --> 28:55.034
You want to be a
lion tamer? Great.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.936
Go tame the goddamn lion.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.840
That's a wrap!

29:08.147 --> 29:09.782
MAN:
You won't have to bother now.

29:09.816 --> 29:12.885
WOMAN:
Oh, yes, I do. My share...

29:12.919 --> 29:14.286
Fine.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.888
You can get married,

29:15.922 --> 29:18.324
but I'm in charge of everything.

29:28.767 --> 29:29.969
(coughs)

29:30.002 --> 29:32.071
Better, Joan?
(weakly): Thank you.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.606
Ray, is there some reason
we're not getting started?

29:34.640 --> 29:35.975
It's very taxing

29:36.008 --> 29:38.144
for Miss Crawford to be
out of bed in her condition.

29:38.177 --> 29:41.413
Bed is the last place
that woman gets any rest.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.182
Gentlemen.
Miss Davis,

29:43.215 --> 29:45.184
please remember
what we discussed.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.788
Gentlemen.

29:49.822 --> 29:53.025
There's now been 29 days
since Miss Crawford completed

29:53.059 --> 29:55.461
a full day's work
on Charlotte, resulting in

29:55.494 --> 29:58.464
expensive delays and
cost overruns for this studio.

29:58.497 --> 30:01.200
Our insurer,
to this point,

30:01.233 --> 30:03.769
has covered those losses
on the basis

30:03.802 --> 30:05.437
of Miss Crawford's
diagnosis

30:05.471 --> 30:07.173
of a rare form of pneumonia.

30:07.206 --> 30:10.843
But her health does not
seem to be improving.

30:10.877 --> 30:11.944
That's because
her condition is mental.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.379
LAWYER:
Is Miss Davis' presence

30:13.412 --> 30:15.281
in this meeting
constructive or necessary?

30:15.314 --> 30:17.649
I'm a producer on this picture.
I'm in all the meetings

30:17.683 --> 30:19.185
whether your client
likes it or not.

30:19.218 --> 30:21.487
According to Bob,
it's a vanity title.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.356
It was.
And that was my fault.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.959
But not anymore.

30:26.993 --> 30:30.196
From now on,
my stamp is on everything.

30:30.229 --> 30:33.232
As I was saying, given that
Miss Crawford's condition

30:33.265 --> 30:35.301
does not seem to be improving,

30:35.334 --> 30:37.669
the studio would like to give
her the freedom to devote

30:37.703 --> 30:39.906
all her energy
to getting well again.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.708
In that spirit, we're offering
to release her from all

30:42.741 --> 30:44.510
contractual obligations.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.312
Mr. Aldrich is ready
to start looking

30:46.345 --> 30:48.080
for somebody else
to play Miriam.

30:48.114 --> 30:50.649
Ray, we all know there is no

30:50.682 --> 30:52.384
Hush... Hush,
Sweet Charlotte

30:52.418 --> 30:54.586
without a reteaming
of Crawford and Davis.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.989
Wrong. This is not
a sequel to Baby Jane.

30:57.023 --> 30:59.725
And there will be no need
to resort to a poor substitute.

30:59.758 --> 31:02.361
Miss Crawford is following
all her doctor's instructions

31:02.394 --> 31:04.196
to the letter,
with the genuine intention

31:04.230 --> 31:07.266
of returning to work
as soon as possible.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.401
Well, Leonard, I'll be candid.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.070
Our insurer has doubts

31:11.103 --> 31:13.872
about how genuine
those intentions are.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.874
They insist
that your client

31:15.908 --> 31:18.044
submit to an independent
medical exam.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.346
Tiny Tim over there
isn't going to let your doctors

31:20.379 --> 31:22.548
get anywhere near her.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.217
She's gassing us all
with her VapoRub for show.

31:25.251 --> 31:27.353
She's not sick.
She's on strike.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.856
Until Bob accepts all
her loony script changes

31:30.889 --> 31:32.858
and makes her
the star of Charlotte.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.761
Miss Davis, if you're incapable
of restraining yourself,

31:35.794 --> 31:37.629
I'll have to ask you to leave.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.438
I would be perfectly happy

31:46.472 --> 31:49.575
to submit
to an independent exam.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.577
Very well.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.080
But before you reject
our initial offer,

31:54.113 --> 31:56.215
know that if
our doctor

31:56.248 --> 31:58.317
clears Miss Crawford
to return to work

31:58.350 --> 32:00.786
and she fails to do so,
we will sue her

32:00.819 --> 32:04.090
to recoup every
cent of our losses.

32:07.693 --> 32:10.796
Splendid. And I want
chimes to ring

32:10.829 --> 32:12.431
the moment they become
man and wife.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.733
Just as their lips touch.
Can that be arranged?

32:14.766 --> 32:17.736
We have bells at the church.
They toll.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.838
Oh, I don't want
a funeral bell.

32:19.871 --> 32:22.808
I want a glorious,
joyful chime.

32:22.841 --> 32:23.976
Uh...

32:24.010 --> 32:25.477
what do you think
of that, B.D.?

32:25.511 --> 32:26.812
Sure.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.182
Do you like it or not?
It's your wedding.

32:30.216 --> 32:32.151
Whatever you think's best.

32:33.819 --> 32:36.022
Could you all please
go into the dining room

32:36.055 --> 32:38.424
and give us a moment?
Thank you.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.527
Darling, I want you
to answer me truthfully,

32:41.560 --> 32:45.497
and don't for a second
worry about the consequences.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.799
Are you having second thoughts

32:47.833 --> 32:49.601
about marrying Jeremy?

32:49.635 --> 32:51.837
What? No.
I just don't see

32:51.870 --> 32:55.274
why we have to make such a big
production out of the wedding.

32:55.307 --> 32:58.377
Well, I'll tell you why.

32:58.410 --> 33:00.779
A wedding is a big,
special party because

33:00.812 --> 33:03.615
everything after that
is hard work and repetition.

33:03.649 --> 33:06.652
It's work to
keep a house.

33:06.685 --> 33:09.555
It's work to fix him
the same goddamn glass of scotch

33:09.588 --> 33:13.025
every night and feign interest
while he rants about his boss.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.194
It's work
to tolerate

33:15.227 --> 33:17.363
his forgetting
to ask you about your day,

33:17.396 --> 33:19.365
and your feelings,
and your thoughts.

33:19.398 --> 33:22.801
And it's work to feel like
a staging ground

33:22.834 --> 33:25.204
for someone else's ambitions.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.639
You just described
my life with you.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.408
(short chuckle)

33:29.441 --> 33:33.045
Well, then I've prepared you
to be a good wife.

33:34.446 --> 33:37.349
And I'm gonna miss you terribly
when you're gone.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.521
This wedding is something
I can give you.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.690
And if you want it,

33:44.723 --> 33:47.859
I want it to be perfect.

33:47.893 --> 33:51.263
Your first wedding is the one
that you remember the most.

33:51.297 --> 33:54.766
My first wedding?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.034
Jeremy and I are forever.

33:56.068 --> 33:57.369
Of course,
darling, I...

33:57.403 --> 33:58.704
Of course.

33:58.737 --> 34:02.508
And however long
that forever lasts,

34:02.541 --> 34:05.010
I want you know
that you will always

34:05.043 --> 34:06.678
have a place
to come home to.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.780
Christ, is that
why you agreed to this--

34:08.814 --> 34:10.449
because you thought
I'd come running back?

34:10.482 --> 34:13.219
No, no, no, no, no, no...
No, Mother.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.920
I'm leaving.

34:14.953 --> 34:18.590
I'm going to be
Jeremy's wife, not yours.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.859
Oh, and guess what--

34:20.892 --> 34:22.394
for your information,

34:22.428 --> 34:25.264
my first wedding was perfect.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.565
It was Saturday.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.634
At City Hall.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.370
We did it the minute
you signed the consent form.

34:31.403 --> 34:34.240
And there were no chimes
for our first kiss

34:34.273 --> 34:35.941
and it was beautiful.

34:35.974 --> 34:37.976
So all of this--

34:38.009 --> 34:40.146
you're not doing it for me.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.614
You're doing it for you.

34:47.353 --> 34:51.123
(door opens, closes)

34:58.597 --> 35:01.233
Just a slightly
elevated temperature.

35:01.267 --> 35:04.403
Really? I feel
so warm. Feverish.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.572
Do you suppose
it's neurological?

35:06.605 --> 35:07.973
What other symptoms
are you experiencing?

35:08.006 --> 35:09.775
Well, light-headedness and...

35:09.808 --> 35:14.546
dizzy spells in the most
inopportune moments.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.016
Breathe in.

35:19.017 --> 35:20.852
Deeper, please.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.454
(inhales, coughs)

35:22.488 --> 35:24.656
Oh.
(coughing)

35:24.690 --> 35:26.592
Excuse me.

35:26.625 --> 35:31.197
Lately I've only been
able to manage the...

35:31.230 --> 35:34.566
shallowest of breaths.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.606
Bob can call me if he needs, but
there's really not much to it.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.941
Officially,
she's completely clear.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.610
PAULINE: You've got
to be kidding me.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.645
Good luck with her.
Thank you.

35:46.678 --> 35:50.849
Well, he says you can
come back to work, Joan.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.452
Said he'll clear you
for a marathon, if you want.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.187
He's the studio's doctor.

35:55.221 --> 35:56.955
What did you expect him to say?

35:56.988 --> 35:58.690
He also said
you tried to seduce him.

35:58.724 --> 36:01.460
That is ridiculous
and offensive.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.695
Mamacita, take me to the car.

36:03.729 --> 36:07.566
This whole experience
has been very fatiguing.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.202
(sighs)
I'm asking you as a fan.

36:10.236 --> 36:11.637
Do not do this to yourself.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.039
And what is it
you imagine I'm doing?

36:14.072 --> 36:16.642
Losing every ally.
They are going to sue you.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.977
No one will stop them.
You're ending your career.

36:19.010 --> 36:22.147
How dare you?
You're a secretary.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.050
Stop following me around,
nipping at my heels,

36:25.083 --> 36:26.885
impugning my integrity.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.087
The moment I get home,
I'm calling Bob

36:29.120 --> 36:31.490
and demanding you be
taken off of Charlotte.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.860
Don't bother. I've already told
Bob that I am done after this.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.528
I came out
here to work.

36:36.562 --> 36:39.197
That seems to be the last thing
that anyone cares about.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.433
I don't know if this town
attracts narcissists

36:41.467 --> 36:43.201
or actually creates them.

36:43.235 --> 36:44.903
But I have no intention
of sticking around

36:44.936 --> 36:46.938
to find out.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.174
(elevator bell dings)

36:49.207 --> 36:51.377
Good luck, Joan.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.211
BLONDELL:
What did I think

36:53.245 --> 36:54.546
of what Joan did?

36:54.580 --> 36:56.214
I thought it was pretty great.

36:56.248 --> 36:58.950
ADAM: You didn't think it
was... undignified?

36:58.984 --> 37:00.286
Faking sick?

37:00.319 --> 37:02.554
Let me tell you something.

37:02.588 --> 37:05.557
At a certain point,
a woman becomes invisible.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.893
You get fat or old--

37:07.926 --> 37:10.896
people don't even
see you anymore.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.565
Oh, come on,
think of it this way:

37:13.599 --> 37:16.568
you've been eating
in a restaurant your whole life.

37:16.602 --> 37:18.304
You're a great customer.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.572
Good tipper. Staff loves you.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.408
You spend all your money there.

37:22.441 --> 37:25.477
And then one day,
they won't serve you.

37:25.511 --> 37:27.078
Won't take your money.

37:27.112 --> 37:29.815
Won't even let you see the menu.

37:29.848 --> 37:32.818
Well, who could blame you

37:32.851 --> 37:35.821
for wanting to stand up
and rip the tablecloth off?

37:35.854 --> 37:38.424
(doorbell rings)

37:39.458 --> 37:41.827
Mamacita?

37:41.860 --> 37:44.262
Will you get the door?

37:44.296 --> 37:46.932
Tell them I'm in the bath.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.636
(doorbell rings)

37:50.669 --> 37:53.038
Mamacita!

37:55.173 --> 37:57.108
(knocking at door)

37:57.142 --> 37:58.377
(groans)

38:01.947 --> 38:04.350
(knocking continues)

38:15.961 --> 38:17.629
Yes?

38:17.663 --> 38:19.965
Good morning, ma'am.
Are you Miss Joan Crawford?

38:19.998 --> 38:22.300
(chuckles)
They make me ask that.

38:22.334 --> 38:23.769
(chuckles)
Please sign for documents

38:23.802 --> 38:26.004
from 20th Century Fox.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.675
What is it?
That's above
my pay grade.

38:29.708 --> 38:32.010
I just make sure you can't
deny receipt in court.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.812
Have a happy day, ma'am.

38:42.554 --> 38:43.822
(gasps)

38:58.336 --> 38:59.538
(whimpers)

39:08.714 --> 39:10.716

39:12.518 --> 39:14.986
ANNOUNCER: Wearing
a $100,000 sapphire necklace

39:15.020 --> 39:17.823
over a hospital gown by Dior,

39:17.856 --> 39:20.659
Joan Crawford is the most
glamorous and popular patient

39:20.692 --> 39:23.495
in the celebrity wing
of Cedars-Sinai Hospital.

39:23.529 --> 39:26.432
Each day, doctors and nurses
line up for the privilege

39:26.465 --> 39:29.267
of taking care
of the ailing movie queen.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.870
Meanwhile, production
on her latest picture,

39:31.903 --> 39:35.040
20th Century Fox's
Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte

39:35.073 --> 39:37.208
has been halted indefinitely.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.945
And with cast and crew
still on full salary,

39:39.978 --> 39:43.381
Charlotte's shaping up to be one
of 20th's priciest pictures

39:43.415 --> 39:46.718
this year.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.887
What can you possibly hope
to gain by delaying production

39:48.920 --> 39:50.288
any further?

39:50.321 --> 39:51.790
You'll get no concessions.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.725
Concessions? Oh, no.

39:53.759 --> 39:56.394
We're way beyond that.
I don't want concessions.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.797
I want blood. I want
to shut this picture down.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.433
Oh, Joan.

40:01.467 --> 40:04.436
I'll lose hundreds
of thousands of dollars

40:04.470 --> 40:06.872
but so will Bette.

40:06.905 --> 40:11.543
And I can live happily
and frugally just knowing that.

40:11.577 --> 40:16.147
And Bob Aldrich can shutter
his production company

40:16.181 --> 40:19.585
and end his career
directing shitty television.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.953
Fuck them both.

40:21.987 --> 40:24.389
You were always ambitious.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.225
But when did you become
so vindictive?

40:27.258 --> 40:29.895
I've always been valued
for my beauty.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.564
And more times than not,

40:32.598 --> 40:34.332
nothing else.

40:34.365 --> 40:37.335
But now the only bed
I can find any power in

40:37.368 --> 40:39.571
is this hospital bed.
(chuckles)

40:39.605 --> 40:42.908
Well, why don't you free
yourself from all this?

40:42.941 --> 40:45.143
Tell 'em you're too
ill to continue.

40:45.176 --> 40:46.812
Let them recast
the role.

40:46.845 --> 40:49.147
Oh, they've already tried.
I know that.

40:49.180 --> 40:52.450
They've gone out
to Loretta Young, to Stanwyck.

40:52.484 --> 40:55.286
Both dear friends of mine. No,
there isn't an actress in town

40:55.320 --> 40:57.923
who would take food out
of my mouth.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.991
That's because most of them
don't eat.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.593
(chuckles)

41:01.627 --> 41:04.362
Don't fool yourself, Joanie.

41:05.396 --> 41:07.699
You watch and see, George.

41:07.733 --> 41:10.368
Next week at this time,

41:10.401 --> 41:13.639
that picture will be canceled,

41:13.672 --> 41:17.208
and Joan Crawford
will make a sudden

41:17.242 --> 41:20.679
and remarkable recovery.

41:25.250 --> 41:28.119
Tell Zanuck no.
Absolutely not!

41:28.153 --> 41:30.455
I am not going to do
this slice of Americana

41:30.488 --> 41:32.858
with the very British
Miss Vivien Leigh.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.960
Who would believe her
as a Southern belle?

41:34.993 --> 41:36.227
She played Scarlett O'Hara.

41:36.261 --> 41:37.863
Unconvincingly.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.297
Do you want to make this movie,
Bette,

41:39.330 --> 41:41.667
or don't you?
I don't want to just make it.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.835
I want to make it properly.
And it's got to be

41:43.869 --> 41:45.904
someone I can work with.
Someone I trust.

41:45.937 --> 41:48.707
Someone who's right
for the goddamn part.

41:48.740 --> 41:49.941
Now call her!

41:52.878 --> 41:54.680
(chuckles)
Darlings,

41:54.713 --> 41:57.248
I'm so flattered
you thought about me.

41:57.282 --> 41:59.084
But it's impossible.

41:59.117 --> 42:02.420
I've only just aired out
my Swiss chalet for the season.

42:02.453 --> 42:07.025
And, besides, I've done my turn
at Grand Guignol already.

42:07.058 --> 42:09.360
*
(screaming)

42:09.394 --> 42:10.762
Help!

42:10.796 --> 42:12.263
Please help!

42:12.297 --> 42:15.867
I'm trapped
in a small private elevator!

42:15.901 --> 42:20.038
The whole experience just left
me feeling... humiliated,

42:20.071 --> 42:21.707
and I'd rather not repeat it.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.209
ROBERT: Oh, no, Olivia.
This is completely different.

42:24.242 --> 42:25.944
This time you're not the victim.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.913
You'd be the villainess.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.915
Oh, no. I don't do bitches.

42:29.948 --> 42:32.083
They make me so unhappy.

42:32.117 --> 42:34.119
You should call my sister.

42:36.421 --> 42:37.723
OLIVIA:
So you can imagine my surprise

42:37.756 --> 42:40.558
two days later
when I opened my door

42:40.592 --> 42:43.561
to a very disheveled
Mr. Robert Aldrich.

42:43.595 --> 42:46.865
He had taken three planes,
a train,

42:46.898 --> 42:50.736
a taxi up a goat trail,
just to get to see me.

42:50.769 --> 42:52.938
So of course I heard him out.

42:52.971 --> 42:55.774
And, what do you know,
he had a very different image

42:55.807 --> 42:58.644
for Cousin Miriam.

Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte
is back on again.

Joan Crawford,

43:16.828 --> 43:19.297

Miss Olivia de Havilland!

another two-time

43:24.302 --> 43:26.838

No!

The pair last worked together
in 1942 on In This Our Life.
No! No!

43:30.709 --> 43:32.510
They played sisters
whose lives are destroyed...

43:32.543 --> 43:34.479
(sobs)
Oh, no!

43:34.512 --> 43:36.682

43:41.319 --> 43:45.023
No! No.

43:45.056 --> 43:47.492

Wait, what are you doing?

43:47.525 --> 43:49.661
Mamacita.
Leaving.

43:49.695 --> 43:52.664
I told you the next time
you throw something at my head,

43:52.698 --> 43:54.099
I leave.

43:54.132 --> 43:55.333
Now I leave.

No. Mamacita, wait!

43:59.905 --> 44:01.472
Please.

44:01.506 --> 44:05.310
You can't leave me now!

44:05.343 --> 44:07.378
Not after what
they've done to me.

44:07.412 --> 44:09.047
You have done
this to yourself.

44:42.413 --> 44:44.149
about ending
Joan Crawford's career?

44:44.182 --> 44:47.685
Time did that all on its own.

As it does to us all.
